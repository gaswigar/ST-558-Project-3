in
search
of
a
father
by
captain
marryat
captain
frederick
marryat
was
born
july
and
died
august
he
retired
from
the
british
navy
in
in
order
to
devote
himself
to
writing
in
the
following
years
he
wrote
books
many
of
which
are
among
the
very
best
of
english
literature
and
some
of
which
are
still
in
print
marryat
had
an
extraordinary
gift
for
the
invention
of
episodes
in
his
stories
he
says
somewhere
that
when
he
sat
down
for
the
day
work
he
never
knew
what
he
was
going
to
write
he
certainly
was
a
literary
genius
japhet
in
search
of
a
father
was
published
in
the
seventh
book
to
flow
from
marryat
pen
it
was
the
first
of
marryat
books
not
to
have
a
nautical
setting
it
is
a
brilliantly
written
book
giving
us
insights
into
aspects
of
nineteenth
century
life
that
we
can
not
easily
get
elsewhere
there
is
a
sustained
and
fascinating
magical
quality
about
the
book
which
makes
it
very
compelling
reading
for
many
people
it
will
be
their
favourite
book
among
marryat
works
and
certainly
it
ranks
as
one
of
the
greatest
books
in
british
literature
this
was
transcribed
in
by
nick
hodson
and
was
reformatted
in
again
in
and
working
from
a
different
edition
again
in

of
a
father
by
captain
frederick
marryat
part
one
chapter
one
like
most
other
children
who
should
be
my
godfather
is
decided
by
mammon
so
precocious
as
to
make
some
noise
in
the
world
and
be
hung
a
few
days
after
i
was
born
cut
down
in
time
and
produce
a
scene
of
bloodshed
my
early
propensities
fully
developed
by
the
choice
of
my
profession
those
who
may
be
pleased
to
honour
these
pages
with
a
perusal
will
not
be
detained
with
a
long
introductory
history
of
my
birth
parentage
and
education
the
very
title
implies
that
at
this
period
of
my
memoirs
i
was
ignorant
of
the
two
first
and
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
due
development
of
my
narrative
that
i
allow
them
to
remain
in
the
same
state
of
bliss
for
in
the
perusal
of
a
tale
as
well
as
in
the
pilgrimage
of
life
ignorance
of
the
future
may
truly
be
considered
as
the
greatest
source
of
happiness
the
little
that
was
known
of
me
at
this
time
i
will
however
narrate
as
concisely
and
as
correctly
as
i
am
able
it
was
on
the
i
really
forget
the
date
and
must
rise
from
my
chair
look
for
a
key
open
a
closet
and
then
open
an
iron
safe
to
hunt
over
a
pile
of
papers
it
will
detain
you
too
long
it
will
be
sufficient
to
say
that
it
was
on
night
but
whether
the
night
was
dark
or
moonlit
or
rainy
or
foggy
or
cloudy
or
fine
or
starlight
i
really
can
not
tell
but
it
is
of
no
very
great
consequence
well
it
was
on
a
night
about
the
hour
there
again
i
puzzled
it
might
have
been
ten
or
eleven
or
twelve
or
between
any
of
these
hours
nay
it
might
have
been
past
midnight
and
far
advancing
to
the
morning
for
what
i
know
to
the
contrary
the
reader
must
excuse
an
infant
of
there
again
i
am
at
a
nonplus
but
we
will
assume
of
some
days
old
if
when
wrapped
up
in
flannel
and
in
a
covered
basket
and
moreover
fast
asleep
at
the
time
he
does
not
exactly
observe
the
state
of
the
weather
and
the
time
by
the
church
clock
i
never
before
was
aware
of
the
great
importance
of
dates
in
telling
a
story
but
it
is
now
too
late
to
recover
these
facts
which
have
been
swept
away
into
oblivion
by
the
broad
wing
of
time
i
must
therefore
just
tell
the
little
i
do
know
trusting
to
the
reader
good
nature
and
to
blanks
it
is
as
follows
that
at
the
hour
of
the
night
the
state
of
the
weather
being
also
i
an
infant
of
a
certain
age
was
suspended
by
somebody
or
somebodies
at
the
knocker
of
the
foundling
hospital
having
made
me
fast
the
said
somebody
or
somebodies
rang
a
peal
upon
the
bell
which
made
the
old
porter
start
up
in
so
great
a
hurry
that
with
the
back
of
his
hand
he
hit
his
better
half
a
blow
on
the
nose
occasioning
a
great
suffusion
of
blood
from
that
organ
and
a
still
greater
pouring
forth
of
invectives
from
the
organ
immediately
below
it
all
this
having
been
effected
by
the
said
peal
on
the
bell
the
said
somebody
or
somebodies
did
incontinently
take
to
their
heels
and
disappear
long
before
the
old
porter
could
pull
his
legs
through
his
nether
garments
and
obey
the
rude
summons
at
last
the
old
man
swang
open
the
gate
and
the
basket
swang
across
his
nose
he
went
in
again
for
a
knife
and
cut
me
down
for
it
was
cruel
to
hang
a
baby
of
a
few
days
old
carried
me
into
the
lodge
lighted
a
candle
and
opened
the
basket
thus
did
i
metaphorically
first
come
to
light
when
he
opened
the
basket
i
opened
my
eyes
and
although
i
did
not
observe
it
the
old
woman
was
standing
at
the
table
in
very
light
attire
sponging
her
nose
over
a
basin
verily
a
pretty
babe
with
black
eyes
exclaimed
the
old
man
in
a
tremulous
voice
black
eyes
indeed
muttered
the
old
woman
i
shall
have
two
beautiful
black
eyes
indeed
continued
the
old
man
terrible
black
eyes
for
sartain
continued
the
old
woman
as
she
sponged
away
poor
thing
it
must
be
cold
murmured
the
old
porter
warrant
i
catch
my
death
muttered
the
wife
but
dear
me
here
a
paper
exclaimed
the
old
man
vinegar
and
brown
paper
echoed
the
old
woman
addressed
to
the
governors
of
the
hospital
continued
the
porter
apply
to
the
dispenser
of
the
hospital
continued
his
wife
and
sealed
said
he
get
it
healed
said
she
the
linen
is
good
it
must
be
the
child
of
no
poor
people
who
knows
soliloquised
the
old
man
my
poor
nose
exclaimed
the
old
woman
i
must
take
it
to
the
nurses
and
the
letter
i
will
give
said
the
old
porter
winding
up
his
portion
of
this
double
soliloquy
and
tottering
away
with
the
basket
and
your
humble
servant
across
the
there
it
will
do
now
said
the
old
wife
wiping
her
face
on
a
towel
and
regaining
her
bed
in
which
she
was
soon
joined
by
her
husband
and
they
finished
their
nap
without
any
further
interruption
during
that
night
the
next
morning
i
was
reported
and
examined
and
the
letter
addressed
to
the
governors
was
opened
and
read
it
was
laconic
but
still
as
most
things
laconic
are
very
much
to
the
point
this
child
was
born
in
wedlock
he
is
to
be
named
japhet
when
circumstances
permit
he
will
be
reclaimed
but
there
was
a
postscript
by
abraham
newland
esquire
promising
to
pay
the
bearer
on
demand
the
sum
of
fifty
pounds
in
plainer
terms
there
was
a
bank
note
to
that
amount
inclosed
in
the
letter
as
in
general
the
parties
who
suspend
children
in
baskets
have
long
before
suspended
cash
payments
or
at
all
events
forget
to
suspend
them
with
the
baskets
my
arrival
created
no
little
noise
to
which
i
added
my
share
until
i
obtained
a
share
of
the
breast
of
a
young
woman
who
like
charity
suckled
two
or
three
babies
at
one
time
we
have
preparatory
schools
all
over
the
kingdom
for
young
gentlemen
from
three
to
five
years
of
age
under
ladies
and
from
four
to
seven
under
either
or
both
sexes
as
it
may
happen
but
the
most
preparatory
of
all
preparatory
schools
is
certainly
the
foundling
hospital
which
takes
in
its
pupils
if
they
are
sent
from
one
to
three
days
old
or
even
hours
if
the
parents
are
in
such
extreme
anxiety
about
their
education
here
it
commences
with
their
weaning
when
they
are
instructed
in
the
mystery
of
devouring
pap
next
they
are
taught
to
walk
and
as
soon
as
they
can
walk
to
sit
still
to
talk
and
as
soon
as
they
can
talk
to
hold
their
tongues
thus
are
they
instructed
and
passed
on
from
one
part
of
the
establishment
to
another
until
they
finally
are
passed
out
of
its
gates
to
get
on
in
the
world
with
the
advantages
of
some
education
and
the
still
further
advantage
of
having
no
father
or
mother
to
provide
for
or
relatives
to
pester
them
with
their
necessities
it
was
so
with
me
i
arrived
at
the
age
of
fourteen
and
notwithstanding
the
promise
contained
in
the
letter
it
appeared
that
circumstances
did
permit
of
my
being
reclaimed
but
i
had
a
great
advantage
over
the
other
inmates
of
the
hospital
the
fifty
pounds
sent
with
me
were
not
added
to
the
funds
of
the
establishment
but
generously
employed
for
my
benefit
by
the
governors
who
were
pleased
with
my
conduct
and
thought
highly
of
my
abilities
instead
of
being
bound
to
a
cordwainer
or
some
other
mechanic
by
the
influence
of
the
governors
added
to
the
fifty
pounds
and
interest
as
a
premium
i
was
taken
by
an
apothecary
who
engaged
to
bring
me
up
to
the
profession
and
now
that
i
am
out
of
the
foundling
we
must
not
travel
quite
so
fast
the
practitioner
who
thus
took
me
by
the
hand
was
a
mr
phineas
cophagus
whose
house
was
most
conveniently
situated
for
business
one
side
of
the
shop
looking
upon
smithfield
market
the
other
presenting
a
surface
of
glass
to
the
principal
street
leading
out
of
the
same
market
it
was
a
house
but
not
in
a
on
each
side
of
the
shop
were
two
gin
establishments
and
next
to
them
were
two
and
then
two
frequented
by
graziers
butchers
and
drovers
did
the
men
drink
so
much
as
to
quarrel
in
their
cups
who
was
so
handy
to
plaster
up
the
broken
heads
as
mr
cophagus
did
a
fat
grazier
eat
himself
into
an
apoplexy
how
very
convenient
was
the
ready
lancet
of
mr
cophagus
did
a
bull
gore
a
man
mr
cophagus
appeared
with
his
diachylon
and
lint
did
an
ox
frighten
a
lady
it
was
in
the
back
parlour
of
mr
cophagus
that
she
was
recovered
from
her
syncope
were
a
sure
market
to
my
master
and
if
an
overdriven
beast
knocked
down
others
it
only
helped
to
set
him
on
his
legs
our
window
suffered
occasionally
but
whether
it
were
broken
heads
or
broken
limbs
or
broken
windows
they
were
well
paid
for
everyone
suffered
but
mr
phineas
cophagus
who
never
suffered
a
patient
to
escape
him
the
shop
had
the
usual
allowance
of
green
yellow
and
blue
bottles
and
in
hot
weather
from
our
vicinity
we
were
visited
by
no
small
proportion
of
bluebottle
flies
we
had
a
white
horse
in
one
window
and
a
brown
horse
in
the
other
to
announce
to
the
drovers
that
we
supplied
and
we
had
all
the
patent
medicines
in
the
known
world
even
to
the
medicine
for
mankind
of
mr
enouy
having
which
i
wondered
on
my
first
arrival
why
we
troubled
ourselves
about
any
others
the
shop
was
large
and
at
the
back
part
there
was
a
most
capacious
iron
mortar
with
a
pestle
to
correspond
the
first
floor
was
tenanted
by
mr
cophagus
who
was
a
bachelor
the
second
floor
was
let
the
others
were
appropriated
to
the
housekeeper
and
to
those
who
formed
the
establishment
in
this
tenement
mr
cophagus
got
on
swimmingly
i
will
therefore
for
the
present
sink
the
shop
that
my
master
may
rise
in
the
estimation
of
the
reader
when
i
describe
his
person
and
his
qualifications
mr
phineas
cophagus
might
have
been
about
years
of
age
when
i
first
had
the
honour
of
an
introduction
to
him
in
the
of
the
foundling
hospital
he
was
of
the
middle
height
his
face
was
thin
his
nose
very
much
hooked
his
eyes
small
and
peering
with
a
twinkle
in
them
his
mouth
large
and
drawn
down
at
one
corner
he
was
stout
in
his
body
and
carried
a
considerable
protuberance
before
him
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
patting
with
his
left
hand
very
complacently
but
although
stout
in
his
body
his
legs
were
mere
spindles
so
that
in
his
appearance
he
reminded
you
of
some
bird
of
the
crane
genus
indeed
i
may
say
that
his
whole
figure
gave
you
just
such
an
impression
as
an
orange
might
do
had
it
taken
to
itself
a
couple
of
pieces
of
tobacco
pipes
as
vehicles
of
locomotion
he
was
dressed
in
a
black
coat
and
waistcoat
white
cravat
and
high
collar
to
his
shirt
blue
cotton
net
pantaloons
and
hessian
boots
both
fitting
so
tight
that
it
appeared
as
if
he
was
proud
of
his
spindle
shanks
his
hat
was
and
low
and
he
carried
a
stout
black
cane
with
a
gold
top
in
his
right
hand
almost
always
raising
the
gold
top
to
his
nose
when
he
spoke
just
as
we
see
doctors
represented
at
a
consultation
in
the
caricature
prints
but
if
his
figure
was
strange
his
language
and
manners
were
still
more
so
he
spoke
as
some
birds
fly
in
jerks
intermixing
his
words
for
he
never
completed
a
whole
sentence
with
and
ending
it
with
so
on
leaving
his
hearers
to
supply
the
context
from
the
heads
of
his
discourse
almost
always
in
motion
he
generally
changed
his
position
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
speaking
walking
to
any
other
part
of
the
room
with
his
cane
to
his
nose
and
his
head
cocked
on
one
side
with
a
tiptoe
gait
when
i
was
ushered
into
his
presence
he
was
standing
with
two
of
the
governors
this
is
the
lad
said
one
of
them
his
name
is
japhet
replied
mr
cophagus
um
scriptural
shem
ham
and
so
on
boy
reads
very
well
and
writes
a
good
hand
he
is
a
very
good
boy
mr
cophagus
read
write
spell
good
and
so
on
bring
him
up
rudiments
spatula
write
labels
um
one
of
these
days
make
a
man
of
him
and
so
on
said
this
strange
personage
walking
round
and
round
me
with
his
cane
to
his
nose
and
scrutinising
my
person
with
his
twinkling
eyes
i
was
dismissed
after
this
examination
and
approval
and
the
next
day
dressed
in
a
plain
suit
of
clothes
was
delivered
by
the
porter
at
the
shop
of
mr
phineas
cophagus
who
was
not
at
home
when
i
arrived
part
one
chapter
two
like
all
tyros
i
find
the
rudiments
of
learning
extremely
difficult
and
laborious
but
advance
so
rapidly
that
i
can
do
without
my
master
a
tall
but
hectic
looking
young
man
stood
behind
the
counter
making
up
prescriptions
and
a
dirty
lad
about
thirteen
years
old
was
standing
near
with
his
basket
to
deliver
the
medicines
to
the
several
addresses
as
soon
as
they
were
ready
the
young
man
behind
the
counter
whose
name
was
brookes
was
within
eighteen
months
of
serving
his
time
when
his
friends
intended
to
establish
him
on
his
own
account
and
this
was
the
reason
which
induced
mr
cophagus
to
take
me
that
i
might
learn
the
business
and
supply
his
place
when
he
left
mr
brookes
was
a
very
quiet
amiable
person
kind
to
me
and
the
other
boy
who
carried
out
the
medicines
and
who
had
been
taken
by
mr
cophagus
for
his
food
and
raiment
the
porter
told
mr
brookes
who
i
was
and
left
me
do
you
think
that
you
will
like
to
be
an
apothecary
said
mr
brookes
to
me
with
a
benevolent
smile
yes
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
not
replied
i
stop
a
moment
said
the
lad
who
was
waiting
with
the
basket
looking
archly
at
me
you
got
through
your
yet
hold
your
tongue
timothy
said
mr
brookes
that
you
are
not
very
fond
of
the
rudiments
as
mr
cophagus
calls
them
is
very

cockly
hairy
i
mean
to
set
up
for
myself
one
of
these
days
i
knock
you
down
one
of
these
days
mr
timothy
if
you
stay
so
long
as
you
do
looking
at
the
print
shops
that
you
may
depend
upon
i
keep
up
all
my
learning
that
way
replied
timothy
walking
off
with
his
load
turning
his
head
round
and
laughing
at
me
as
he
quitted
the
shop
mr
brookes
smiled
but
said
nothing
as
timothy
went
out
in
came
mr
cophagus
heh
japhet
i
see
said
he
putting
up
his
cane
nothing
to
do
bad
must
work
um
and
so
on
mr
brookes
boy
learn
rudiments
good
and
so
on
hereupon
mr
cophagus
took
his
cane
from
his
nose
pointed
to
the
large
iron
mortar
and
then
walked
away
into
the
back
parlour
mr
brookes
understood
his
master
if
i
did
not
he
wiped
out
the
mortar
threw
in
some
drugs
and
showing
me
how
to
use
the
pestle
left
me
to
my
work
in
half
an
hour
i
discovered
why
it
was
that
timothy
had
such
an
objection
to
what
mr
cophagus
facetiously
termed
the
of
the
profession
it
was
dreadful
hard
work
for
a
boy
the
perspiration
ran
down
me
in
streams
and
i
could
hardly
lift
my
arms
when
mr
cophagus
passed
through
the
shop
and
looked
at
me
as
i
continued
to
thump
away
with
the
heavy
iron
pestle
good
said
he
and
so
on
i
thought
it
was
a
very
rough
road
to
such
preferment
and
i
stopped
to
take
a
little
breath
japhet
christian
name
and
so
on
sirname
heh
mr
cophagus
wishes
to
know
your
other
name
said
mr
brookes
interpreting
i
have
omitted
to
acquaint
the
reader
that
sirnames
as
well
as
christian
names
are
always
given
to
the
children
at
the
foundling
and
in
consequence
of
the
bank
note
found
in
my
basket
i
had
been
named
after
the
celebrated
personage
whose
signature
it
bore
newland
is
my
other
name
sir
replied
i
newland
heh
very
good
name
everybody
likes
to
see
that
name
and
have
plenty
of
them
in
his
pockets
too
um
very
comfortable
and
so
on
replied
mr
cophagus
leaving
the
shop
i
resumed
my
thumping
occupation
when
timothy
returned
with
his
empty
basket
he
laughed
when
he
saw
me
at
work
well
how
do
you
like
the
rudimans
and
so
on
heh
said
he
mimicking
mr
cophagus
not
overmuch
replied
i
wiping
my
face
that
was
my
job
before
you
came
i
have
been
more
than
a
year
and
never
have
got
out
of
those
rudimans
yet
and
i
suppose
i
never
shall
mr
brookes
perceiving
that
i
was
tired
desired
me
to
leave
off
an
order
which
i
gladly
obeyed
and
i
took
my
seat
in
a
corner
of
the
shop
there
said
timothy
laying
down
his
basket
no
more
work
for
me
is
there
mr
brookes
no
tim
but
you
off
again
dinner
being
ready
and
mr
cophagus
having
returned
he
and
mr
brookes
went
into
the
back
parlour
leaving
timothy
and
me
in
the
shop
to
announce
customers
and
i
shall
take
this
opportunity
of
introducing
mr
timothy
more
particularly
as
he
will
play
a
very
conspicuous
part
in
this
narrative
timothy
was
short
in
stature
for
his
age
but
very
strongly
built
he
had
an
oval
face
with
a
very
dark
complexion
grey
eyes
flashing
from
under
their
long
eyelashes
and
eyebrows
nearly
meeting
each
other
he
was
marked
with
the
small
pox
not
so
much
as
to
disfigure
him
but
still
it
was
very
perceptible
when
near
to
him
his
countenance
was
always
lighted
up
with
merriment
there
was
such
a
happy
expression
in
his
face
that
you
liked
him
the
first
minute
that
you
were
in
his
company
and
i
was
intimate
with
him
immediately
i
say
japhet
said
he
where
did
you
come
from
the
foundling
replied
i
then
you
have
no
friends
or
relations
if
i
have
i
do
not
know
where
to
find
them
replied
i
very
gravely
pooh
do
be
grave
upon
it
i
any
either
i
was
brought
up
by
the
parish
in
the
workhouse
i
was
found
at
the
door
of
a
gentleman
house
who
sent
me
to
the
overseers
i
was
about
a
year
old
then
they
call
me
a
foundling
but
i
do
care
what
they
call
me
so
long
as
they
do
call
me
too
late
for
dinner
father
and
mother
whoever
they
were
when
they
run
away
from
me
did
run
away
with
my
appetite
i
wonder
how
long
master
means
to
play
with
his
knife
and
fork
as
for
mr
brookes
what
he
eats
would
physic
a
snipe
your
other
name
japhet
newland
newland
now
you
shall
have
mine
in
exchange
timothy
oldmixon
at
your
service
they
christened
me
after
the
workhouse
pump
which
had
oldmixon
fecit
on
it
and
the
overseers
thought
it
as
good
a
name
to
give
me
as
any
other
so
i
was
christened
after
the
with
some
of
the
pump
water
as
soon
as
i
was
big
enough
they
employed
me
to
pump
all
the
water
for
the
use
of
the
workhouse
i
worked
at
my
as
i
called
the
pump
all
day
long
few
sons
worked
their
father
more
or
disliked
him
so
much
and
now
japhet
you
see
from
habit
i
pumping
you
you
soon
pump
dry
then
for
i
very
little
to
tell
you
replied
i
but
tell
me
what
sort
of
a
person
is
our
master
he
just
what
you
see
him
never
alters
hardly
ever
out
of
humour
and
when
he
is
he
is
just
as
odd
as
ever
he
very
often
threatens
me
but
i
have
never
had
a
blow
yet
although
mr
brookes
has
complained
once
or
twice
but
surely
mr
brookes
is
not
cross
no
he
is
a
very
good
gentleman
but
sometimes
i
carry
on
my
rigs
a
little
too
far
i
must
say
that
for
as
mr
brookes
says
people
may
die
for
want
of
the
medicines
because
i
put
down
my
basket
to
play
it
very
true
but
i
ca
give
up
in
the
ring
on
that
account
but
then
i
only
get
a
box
of
the
ear
from
mr
brookes
and
that
goes
for
nothing
mr
cophagus
shakes
his
stick
and
says
boy
big
stick
um
wo
forget
next
time
and
so
on
continued
timothy
laughing
and
it
is
so
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
by
this
time
mr
cophagus
and
his
assistant
had
finished
their
dinner
and
came
into
the
shop
the
former
looked
at
me
put
his
stick
to
his
nose
little
boys
always
hungry
um
like
good
dinner
roast
beef
yorkshire
pudding
and
so
on
and
he
pointed
with
the
stick
to
the
back
parlour
timothy
and
i
understood
him
very
well
this
time
we
went
into
the
parlour
when
the
housekeeper
sat
down
with
us
and
helped
us
she
was
a
terribly
cross
little
old
woman
but
as
honest
as
she
was
cross
which
is
all
that
i
shall
say
in
her
favour
timothy
was
no
favourite
because
he
had
such
a
good
appetite
and
it
appeared
that
i
was
not
very
likely
to
stand
well
in
her
good
opinion
for
i
also
ate
a
great
deal
and
every
extra
mouthful
i
took
i
sank
in
her
estimation
till
i
was
nearly
at
the
zero
where
timothy
had
long
been
for
the
same
offence
but
mr
cophagus
would
not
allow
her
to
stint
him
saying
little
boys
must
eat
or
wo
grow
and
so
on
i
soon
found
out
that
we
were
not
only
well
fed
but
in
every
other
point
well
treated
and
i
was
very
comfortable
and
happy
mr
brookes
instructed
me
in
the
art
of
labelling
and
tying
up
and
in
a
very
short
time
i
was
very
expert
and
as
timothy
predicted
the
rudiments
were
once
more
handed
over
to
him
mr
cophagus
supplied
me
with
good
clothes
but
never
gave
me
any
and
timothy
and
i
often
lamented
that
we
had
not
even
a
halfpenny
to
spend
before
i
had
been
many
months
in
the
shop
mr
brookes
was
able
to
leave
when
any
exigence
required
his
immediate
attendance
i
made
up
the
pills
but
he
weighed
out
the
quantities
in
the
prescriptions
if
therefore
anyone
came
in
for
medicines
i
desired
them
to
wait
the
return
of
mr
brookes
who
would
be
in
very
soon
one
day
when
mr
brookes
was
out
and
i
was
sitting
behind
the
counter
timothy
sitting
on
it
and
swinging
his
legs
to
and
fro
both
lamenting
that
we
had
no
timothy
said
japhet
i
been
puzzling
my
brains
how
we
can
get
some
money
and
i
hit
it
at
last
let
you
and
i
turn
doctors
we
wo
send
all
the
people
away
who
come
when
mr
brookes
is
out
but
we
physic
them
ourselves
i
jumped
at
the
idea
and
he
had
hardly
proposed
it
when
an
old
woman
came
in
and
addressing
timothy
said
that
she
wanted
something
for
her
poor
grandchild
sore
throat
i
do
mix
up
the
medicines
replied
timothy
you
must
apply
to
that
gentleman
mr
newland
who
is
behind
the
counter
he
understands
what
is
good
for
everybody
complaints
bless
his
handsome
face
and
so
young
too
why
be
you
a
doctor
sir
i
should
hope
so
replied
i
what
is
it
you
require
a
lotion
or
an
embrocation
i
do
understand
those
hard
words
but
i
want
some
doctor
stuff
very
well
my
good
woman
i
know
what
is
proper
replied
i
assuming
an
important
air
here
timothy
wash
out
this
vial
very
clean
yes
sir
replied
timothy
very
respectfully
i
took
one
of
the
measures
and
putting
in
a
little
green
a
little
blue
and
a
little
white
liquid
from
the
medicine
bottles
generally
used
by
mr
brookes
filled
it
up
with
water
poured
the
mixture
into
the
vial
corked
and
labelled
it
statim
and
handed
it
over
the
counter
to
the
old
woman
is
the
poor
child
to
take
it
or
is
it
to
rub
outside
inquired
the
old
woman
the
directions
are
on
the
label
but
you
do
read
latin
deary
me
no
latin
and
do
you
understand
latin
what
a
nice
clever
boy
i
should
not
be
a
good
doctor
if
i
did
not
replied
i
on
second
thoughts
i
consider
it
advisable
and
safer
that
the
application
should
be
so
i
translated
the
label
to
her
rub
it
in
on
the
throat
with
the
palm
of
the
hand
deary
me
and
does
it
mean
all
that
how
much
have
i
to
pay
sir
embrocation
is
a
very
dear
medicine
my
good
woman
it
ought
to
be
but
as
you
are
a
poor
woman
i
shall
only
charge
you
i
sure
i
thank
you
kindly
replied
the
old
woman
putting
down
the
money
and
wishing
me
a
good
morning
as
she
left
the
shop
bravo
cried
timothy
rubbing
his
hands
it
halves
japhet
is
it
not
yes
i
replied
but
first
we
must
be
honest
and
not
cheat
mr
cophagus
the
vial
is
sold
you
know
for
one
penny
and
i
suppose
the
stuff
i
have
taken
is
not
worth
a
penny
more
now
if
we
put
aside
for
mr
cophagus
we
do
cheat
him
or
steal
his
property
the
other
is
of
course
our
own
being
the
of
the
but
how
shall
we
account
for
receiving
the
said
timothy
selling
two
vials
instead
of
one
they
are
never
reckoned
you
know
that
will
do
capitally
cried
timothy
and
now
for
halves
but
this
could
not
be
managed
until
timothy
had
run
out
and
changed
the
sixpence
we
then
each
had
our
halfpenny
and
for
once
in
our
lives
could
say
that
we
had
money
in
our
pockets
part
one
chapter
three
i
perform
a
wonderful
cure
upon
saint
john
long
principle
having
little
or
no
principle
of
my
own
i
begin
to
puzzle
my
head
with
a
problem
of
all
others
most
difficult
to
solve
the
success
of
our
first
attempt
encouraged
us
to
proceed
but
afraid
that
i
might
do
some
mischief
i
asked
of
mr
brookes
the
nature
and
qualities
of
the
various
medicines
as
he
was
mixing
the
prescriptions
that
i
might
avoid
taking
any
of
those
which
were
poisonous
mr
brookes
pleased
with
my
continual
inquiries
gave
me
all
the
information
i
could
desire
and
thus
i
gained
not
only
a
great
deal
of
information
but
also
a
great
deal
of
credit
with
mr
cophagus
to
whom
mr
brookes
had
made
known
my
diligence
and
thirst
for
knowledge
good
very
good
said
mr
cophagus
fine
boy
learns
his
business
one
of
these
days
ride
in
his
coach
um
and
so
on
nevertheless
at
my
second
attempt
i
made
an
awkward
mistake
which
very
near
led
to
detection
an
irish
labourer
more
than
half
tipsy
came
in
one
evening
and
asked
whether
we
had
such
a
thing
as
was
called
poor
man
by
the
powers
it
will
be
a
poor
man
plaster
when
it
belongs
to
me
but
they
tell
me
that
it
is
a
sure
and
sartain
cure
for
the
thumbago
as
they
call
it
which
i
at
the
small
of
my
back
and
which
is
a
hinder
to
my
mounting
up
the
ladder
so
as
saturday
night
and
i
just
got
the
money
i
buy
the
plaster
first
and
then
try
what
a
little
whisky
inside
will
do
the
devil
in
it
if
it
wo
be
driven
out
of
me
between
the
two
we
had
not
that
plaster
in
the
shop
but
we
had
blister
plaster
and
timothy
handing
one
to
me
i
proffered
it
to
him
and
what
may
you
be
after
asking
for
this
same
inquired
he
the
blister
plasters
were
sold
at
a
shilling
each
when
spread
on
paper
so
i
asked
him
that
we
might
pocket
the
extra
sixpence
by
the
powers
one
would
think
that
you
had
made
a
mistake
and
handed
me
the
rich
man
plaster
instead
of
the
poor
one
it
less
whisky
i
have
to
drink
anyhow
but
here
the
money
and
the
top
of
the
morning
to
ye
seeing
as
how
it
jist
getting
late
timothy
and
i
laughed
as
we
divided
the
sixpence
it
appeared
that
after
taking
his
allowance
of
whisky
the
poor
fellow
fixed
the
plaster
on
his
back
when
he
went
to
bed
and
the
next
morning
found
himself
in
a
condition
not
to
be
envied
it
was
a
week
before
we
saw
him
again
and
much
to
the
horror
of
timothy
and
myself
he
walked
into
the
shop
when
mr
brookes
was
employed
behind
the
counter
timothy
perceived
him
before
he
saw
us
and
pulling
me
behind
the
large
mortar
we
contrived
to
make
our
escape
into
the
back
parlour
the
door
of
which
we
held
ajar
to
hear
what
would
take
place
murder
and
turf
cried
the
man
but
that
was
the
devil
own
plaster
that
you
gave
me
here
for
my
back
and
it
left
me
as
raw
as
a
turnip
taking
every
bit
of
my
skin
off
me
entirely
forebye
my
lying
in
bed
for
a
whole
week
and
losing
my
day
work
i
ready
do
not
recollect
supplying
you
with
a
plaster
my
good
man
replied
mr
brookes
then
by
the
piper
that
played
before
moses
if
you
do
recollect
it
i
an
idea
that
i
shall
never
forget
it
sure
enough
it
cured
me
but
was
i
quite
kilt
before
i
was
cured
it
must
have
been
some
other
shop
observed
mr
brookes
you
have
made
a
mistake
devil
a
bit
of
mistake
except
in
selling
me
the
plaster
did
i
get
it
of
a
lad
in
this
same
shop
nobody
sells
things
out
of
this
shop
without
my
knowledge
the
irishman
was
puzzled
he
looked
round
the
shop
well
then
if
this
the
shop
it
was
own
sister
to
it
timothy
called
mr
brookes
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
timothy
in
the
other
shop
for
i
heard
the
boy
call
the
other
by
the
name
however
it
no
matter
if
it
took
off
the
skin
it
also
took
away
the
thumbago
so
the
morning
to
you
mr
pottykary
when
the
irishman
departed
we
made
our
appearance
japhet
did
you
sell
a
plaster
to
an
irishman
yes
do
you
recollect
last
saturday
and
i
gave
you
the
shilling
very
true
but
what
did
he
ask
for
he
asked
for
a
plaster
but
he
was
very
tipsy
i
showed
him
a
blister
and
he
took
it
and
then
i
looked
at
timothy
and
laughed
you
must
not
play
such
tricks
said
mr
brookes
i
see
what
you
have
been
about
it
was
a
joke
to
you
but
not
to
him
mr
brookes
who
imagined
we
had
sold
it
to
the
irishman
out
of
fun
then
gave
us
a
very
severe
lecture
and
threatened
to
acquaint
mr
cophagus
if
ever
we
played
such
tricks
again
thus
the
affair
blew
over
and
it
made
me
very
careful
and
as
every
day
i
knew
more
about
medicines
i
was
soon
able
to
mix
them
so
as
to
be
of
service
to
those
who
applied
and
before
eighteen
months
had
expired
i
was
trusted
with
the
mixing
up
of
all
the
prescriptions
at
the
end
of
that
period
mr
brookes
left
us
and
i
took
the
whole
of
his
department
upon
myself
giving
great
satisfaction
to
mr
cophagus
and
now
that
i
have
announced
my
promotion
it
will
perhaps
be
as
well
that
i
give
the
reader
some
idea
of
my
personal
appearance
upon
which
i
have
hitherto
been
silent
i
was
thin
between
fifteen
and
sixteen
years
old
very
tall
for
my
age
and
of
my
figure
i
had
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
a
large
beaming
eye
with
a
slightly
aquiline
nose
a
high
forehead
fair
in
complexion
but
with
dark
hair
i
was
always
what
may
be
termed
a
remarkably
boy
from
the
peculiarity
of
my
skin
and
complexion
my
teeth
were
small
but
were
transparent
and
i
had
a
very
deep
dimple
in
my
chin
like
all
embryo
apothecaries
i
carried
in
my
appearance
if
not
the
look
of
wisdom
most
certainly
that
of
which
does
equally
well
with
the
world
in
general
my
forehead
was
smooth
and
very
white
and
my
dark
locks
were
combed
back
systematically
and
with
a
regularity
that
said
as
plainly
as
hair
could
do
the
owner
of
this
does
everything
by
prescription
measurement
and
rule
with
my
long
fingers
i
folded
up
the
little
packets
with
an
air
as
thoughtful
and
imposing
as
that
of
a
minister
who
has
just
presented
a
protocol
as
interminable
as
unintelligible
and
the
look
of
solemn
sagacity
with
which
i
poured
out
the
contents
of
one
vial
into
the
other
would
have
well
become
the
king
physician
when
he
watched
the
lord
anointed
in
as
i
followed
up
my
saturnine
avocation
i
generally
had
an
open
book
on
the
counter
beside
me
not
a
dirty
volume
from
the
minerva
press
or
a
worth
of
fashionable
trash
but
a
good
honest
book
horribly
stuffed
with
epithet
of
drug
a
book
in
which
latin
words
were
redundant
and
here
and
there
were
to
be
observed
the
crabbed
characters
of
greek
altogether
with
my
book
and
my
look
i
cut
such
a
truly
medical
appearance
that
even
the
most
guarded
would
not
have
hesitated
to
allow
me
the
sole
conduct
of
a
whitlow
from
inflammation
to
suppuration
and
from
suppuration
to
cure
or
have
refused
to
have
confided
to
me
the
entire
suppression
of
a
gumboil
such
were
my
personal
qualifications
at
the
time
that
i
was
raised
to
the
important
office
of
dispenser
of
i
may
say
life
and
death
it
will
not
surprise
the
reader
when
i
tell
him
that
i
was
much
noticed
by
those
who
came
to
consult
or
talk
with
mr
cophagus
a
very
fine
looking
lad
that
mr
cophagus
an
acquaintance
would
say
where
did
you
get
him
who
is
his
father
father
mr
cophagus
would
reply
when
they
had
gained
the
back
parlour
but
i
could
overhear
him
father
um
ca
tell
love
concealment
child
born
foundling
hospital
put
out
and
so
on
this
was
constantly
occurring
and
the
constant
occurrence
made
me
often
reflect
upon
my
condition
which
otherwise
i
might
from
the
happy
and
even
tenor
of
my
life
have
forgotten
when
i
retired
to
my
bed
i
would
revolve
in
my
mind
all
that
i
had
gained
from
the
governors
of
the
hospital
relative
to
the
paper
found
in
the
basket
had
been
given
to
me
i
was
born
in
wedlock
at
least
so
said
that
paper
the
sum
left
with
me
also
proved
that
my
parents
could
not
at
my
birth
have
been
paupers
the
very
peculiar
circumstances
attending
my
case
only
made
me
more
anxious
to
know
my
parentage
i
was
now
old
enough
to
be
aware
of
the
value
of
birth
and
i
was
also
just
entering
the
age
of
romance
and
many
were
the
strange
and
absurd
reveries
in
which
i
indulged
at
one
time
i
would
cherish
the
idea
that
i
was
of
a
noble
if
not
princely
birth
and
frame
reasons
for
concealment
at
others
but
it
is
useless
to
repeat
the
absurdities
and
castle
buildings
which
were
generated
in
my
brain
from
mystery
my
airy
fabrics
would
at
last
disappear
and
leave
me
in
all
the
misery
of
doubt
and
abandoned
hope
mr
cophagus
when
the
question
was
sometimes
put
to
him
would
say
good
boy
very
good
boy
do
want
a
father
but
he
was
wrong
i
did
want
a
father
and
every
day
the
want
became
more
pressing
and
i
found
myself
continually
repeating
the
question
is
my
part
one
chapter
four
very
much
puzzled
with
a
new
patient
nevertheless
take
my
degree
at
fifteen
as
an
and
what
is
still
more
acceptable
i
pocket
the
fees
the
departure
of
mr
brookes
of
course
rendered
me
more
able
to
follow
up
with
timothy
my
little
professional
attempts
to
procure
but
independent
of
these
pillages
by
the
aid
of
pills
and
making
drafts
upon
our
master
legitimate
profits
by
the
assistance
of
draughts
from
his
shop
accident
shortly
enabled
me
to
raise
the
ways
and
means
in
a
more
rapid
manner
but
of
this
directly
in
the
mean
time
i
was
fast
gaining
knowledge
every
evening
i
read
surgical
and
medical
books
put
into
my
hands
by
mr
cophagus
who
explained
whenever
i
applied
to
him
and
i
soon
obtained
a
very
fair
smattering
of
my
profession
he
also
taught
me
how
to
bleed
by
making
me
in
the
first
instance
puncture
very
scientifically
all
the
larger
veins
of
a
until
well
satisfied
with
the
delicacy
of
my
hand
and
the
precision
of
my
eye
he
wound
up
his
instructions
by
permitting
me
to
breathe
a
vein
in
his
own
arm
well
said
timothy
when
he
first
saw
me
practising
i
have
often
heard
it
said
there
no
getting
blood
out
of
a
turnip
but
it
seems
there
is
more
chance
with
a
cabbage
i
tell
you
what
japhet
you
may
try
your
hand
upon
me
as
much
as
you
please
for
a
go
i
consented
to
this
arrangement
and
by
dint
of
practising
on
timothy
over
and
over
again
i
became
quite
perfect
i
should
here
observe
that
my
anxiety
relative
to
my
birth
increased
every
day
and
that
in
one
of
the
books
lent
me
by
mr
cophagus
there
was
a
dissertation
upon
the
human
frame
sympathies
antipathies
and
also
on
those
features
and
peculiarities
most
likely
to
descend
from
one
generation
to
another
it
was
there
asserted
that
the
was
the
facial
feature
most
likely
to
be
transmitted
from
father
to
son
as
i
before
have
mentioned
my
nose
was
rather
aquiline
and
after
i
had
read
this
book
it
was
surprising
with
what
eagerness
i
examined
the
faces
of
those
whom
i
met
and
if
i
saw
a
nose
upon
any
man
face
at
all
resembling
my
own
i
immediately
would
wonder
and
surmise
whether
that
person
could
be
my
father
the
constant
dwelling
upon
the
subject
at
last
created
a
species
of
monomania
and
a
hundred
times
a
day
i
would
mutter
to
myself
is
my
indeed
the
very
bells
when
they
rung
a
peal
seemed
as
in
the
case
of
whittington
to
chime
the
question
and
at
last
i
talked
so
much
on
the
subject
to
timothy
who
was
my
and
bosom
friend
that
i
really
believe
partial
as
he
was
to
me
he
wished
my
father
at
the
devil
our
shop
was
well
appointed
with
all
that
glare
and
glitter
with
which
we
decorate
the
of
of
disease
and
death
being
situated
in
such
a
thoroughfare
passengers
would
stop
to
look
in
and
and
in
other
garments
still
more
ragged
little
boys
would
stand
to
stare
at
the
variety
of
colours
and
the
gentleman
your
humble
servant
who
presided
over
so
many
phalanxes
which
decorated
the
sides
of
the
shop
among
those
who
always
stopped
and
gazed
as
she
passed
by
which
was
generally
three
or
four
times
a
day
was
a
female
apparently
about
forty
years
of
age
straight
as
an
arrow
with
an
elasticity
of
step
and
a
decision
in
her
manner
of
walking
which
was
almost
masculine
although
her
form
notwithstanding
that
it
was
tall
and
thin
was
extremely
feminine
and
graceful
sometimes
she
would
fix
her
eyes
upon
me
and
there
was
a
wildness
in
her
looks
which
certainly
gave
a
painful
impression
and
at
the
same
time
so
fascinated
me
that
when
i
met
her
gaze
the
paper
which
contained
the
powder
remained
unfolded
and
the
arm
which
was
pouring
out
the
liquid
suspended
she
was
often
remarked
by
timothy
as
well
as
me
and
we
further
observed
that
her
step
was
not
equal
throughout
the
day
in
her
latter
peregrinations
towards
the
evening
her
gait
was
more
vigorous
but
unequal
at
the
same
time
that
her
gaze
was
more
steadfast
she
usually
passed
the
shop
for
the
last
time
each
day
about
five
in
the
afternoon
one
evening
after
we
had
watched
her
past
as
we
supposed
to
return
no
more
till
the
ensuing
morning
for
this
peeping
in
on
her
part
had
become
an
expected
occurrence
and
afforded
much
amusement
to
timothy
who
designated
her
as
the
mad
woman
to
our
great
surprise
and
to
the
alarm
of
timothy
who
sprang
over
the
counter
and
took
a
position
by
my
side
she
walked
into
the
shop
her
eye
appeared
wild
as
usual
but
i
could
not
make
out
that
it
was
insanity
i
recovered
my
and
desired
timothy
to
hand
the
lady
a
chair
begging
to
know
in
what
way
i
could
be
useful
timothy
walked
round
by
the
end
of
the
counter
pushed
a
chair
near
to
her
and
then
made
a
hasty
retreat
to
his
former
position
she
declined
the
chair
with
a
motion
of
her
hand
in
which
there
was
much
dignity
as
well
as
grace
and
placing
upon
the
counter
her
hands
which
were
small
and
beautifully
white
she
bent
forwards
towards
me
and
said
in
a
sweet
low
voice
which
actually
startled
me
by
its
depth
of
melody
i
am
very
my
astonishment
increased
why
i
know
not
because
the
exceptions
are
certainly
as
many
as
the
general
rule
we
always
form
an
estimate
of
the
voice
before
we
hear
it
from
the
outward
appearance
of
the
speaker
and
when
i
looked
up
in
her
face
which
was
now
exposed
to
the
glare
of
the
argand
lamp
and
witnessed
the
cadaverous
pale
chalky
expression
on
it
and
the
crow
feet
near
the
eyes
and
wrinkles
on
her
forehead
i
should
have
sooner
expected
to
have
heard
a
burst
of
heavenly
symphony
from
a
thundercloud
than
such
music
as
issued
from
her
parted
lips
good
heavens
madam
said
i
eagerly
and
respectfully
allow
me
to
send
for
mr
cophagus
by
no
means
replied
she
i
come
to
you
i
am
aware
continued
she
in
an
undertone
that
you
dispense
medicines
give
advice
and
receive
money
yourself
i
felt
very
much
agitated
and
the
blush
of
detection
mounted
up
to
my
forehead
timothy
who
heard
what
she
said
showed
his
uneasiness
in
a
variety
of
grotesque
ways
he
drew
up
his
legs
alternately
as
if
he
were
dancing
on
hot
plates
he
slapped
his
pockets
grinned
clenched
his
fists
ground
his
teeth
and
bit
his
lips
till
he
made
the
blood
come
at
last
he
sidled
up
to
me
she
has
been
peeping
and
screwing
those
eyes
of
hers
into
this
shop
for
something
it
is
all
up
with
both
of
us
unless
you
can
buy
her
off
i
have
madam
said
i
at
last
ventured
to
prescribe
in
some
trivial
cases
and
as
you
say
receive
money
when
my
master
is
not
here
but
i
am
entrusted
with
the
till
i
know
i
know
you
need
not
fear
me
you
are
too
modest
what
i
would
request
is
that
you
would
prescribe
for
me
as
i
have
no
great
opinion
of
your
master
talents
if
you
wish
it
madam
said
i
bowing
respectfully
you
have
camphor
julep
ready
made
up
have
you
not
yes
madam
replied
i
then
do
me
the
favour
to
send
the
boy
with
a
bottle
to
my
house
directly
i
handed
down
the
bottle
she
paid
for
it
and
putting
it
into
timothy
hands
desired
him
to
take
it
to
the
direction
which
she
gave
him
timothy
put
on
his
hat
cocked
his
eye
at
me
and
left
us
alone
what
is
your
name
said
she
in
the
same
melodious
voice
japhet
newland
madam
replied
i
japhet
it
is
a
good
a
scriptural
name
said
the
lady
musing
in
half
soliloquy
newland
that
sounds
of
mammon
this
mystery
is
unravelled
thought
i
and
i
was
right
in
my
conjectures
she
is
some
fanatical
methodist
but
i
looked
at
her
again
and
her
dress
disclaimed
the
idea
for
in
it
there
was
much
taste
displayed
who
gave
you
that
name
said
she
after
a
pause
the
question
was
simple
enough
but
it
stirred
up
a
host
of
annoying
recollections
but
not
wishing
to
make
a
confidant
of
her
i
gently
replied
as
i
used
to
do
in
the
foundling
hospital
on
sunday
morning
my
godfathers
and
godmothers
in
my
baptism
my
dear
sir
i
am
very
ill
said
she
after
a
pause
will
you
feel
my
pulse
i
touched
a
wrist
and
looked
at
a
hand
that
was
worthy
of
being
admired
what
a
pity
thought
i
that
she
should
be
old
ugly
and
half
crazy
do
you
not
think
that
this
pulse
of
mine
exhibits
considerable
nervous
excitement
i
reckoned
it
this
morning
it
was
at
a
hundred
and
twenty
it
certainly
beats
quick
replied
i
but
perhaps
the
camphor
julep
may
prove
beneficial
i
thank
you
for
your
advice
mr
newland
said
she
laying
down
a
guinea
and
if
i
am
not
better
i
will
call
again
or
send
for
you
good
night
she
walked
out
of
the
shop
leaving
me
in
no
small
astonishment
what
could
she
mean
i
was
lost
in
reverie
when
timothy
returned
the
guinea
remained
on
the
counter
i
met
her
going
home
said
he
bless
me
a
guinea
why
japhet
i
recounted
all
that
had
passed
well
then
it
has
turned
out
well
for
us
instead
of
ill
as
i
expected
the
reminded
me
that
we
shared
profits
on
these
occasions
and
i
offered
timothy
his
half
but
tim
with
all
his
was
not
selfish
and
he
stoutly
refused
to
take
his
share
he
dubbed
me
an
and
said
i
had
beaten
mr
cophagus
already
for
he
had
never
taken
a
physician
fee
i
can
not
understand
it
timothy
said
i
after
a
few
minutes
thought
i
can
replied
timothy
she
has
looked
in
at
the
window
until
she
has
fallen
in
love
with
your
handsome
face
that
it
depend
upon
it
as
i
could
find
no
other
cause
and
tim
opinion
was
backed
by
my
own
vanity
i
imagined
that
such
must
be
the
case
yes
is
so
continued
timothy
as
the
saying
is
there
money
bid
for
you
i
wish
that
it
had
not
been
by
so
a
person
at
all
events
tim
replied
i
i
can
not
return
her
affection
never
mind
that
so
long
as
you
do
return
the
money
the
next
evening
she
made
her
appearance
bought
as
before
a
bottle
of
camphor
julep
sent
timothy
home
with
it
and
asking
my
advice
paid
me
another
guinea
really
madam
said
i
putting
it
back
towards
her
i
am
not
entitled
to
it
yes
you
are
replied
she
i
know
you
have
no
friends
and
i
also
know
that
you
deserve
them
you
must
purchase
books
you
must
study
or
you
never
will
be
a
great
man
she
then
sat
down
entered
into
conversation
and
i
was
struck
with
the
fire
and
vigour
of
the
remarks
which
were
uttered
in
such
a
melodious
tone
her
visits
during
a
month
were
frequent
and
every
time
did
she
press
upon
me
a
fee
although
not
in
love
with
her
person
i
certainly
felt
very
grateful
and
moreover
was
charmed
with
the
superiority
of
her
mind
we
were
now
on
the
most
friendly
and
confiding
terms
one
evening
she
said
to
me
japhet
we
have
now
been
friends
some
time
can
i
trust
you
with
your
life
if
it
were
necessary
replied
i
i
believe
it
said
she
then
can
you
leave
the
shop
and
come
to
me
evening
yes
if
you
will
send
your
maid
for
me
saying
that
you
are
not
well
i
will
at
eight
farewell
then
till
part
one
chapter
five
my
vanity
receives
a
desperate
wound
but
my
heart
remains
unscathed
an
anomaly
in
woman
one
who
despises
beauty
the
next
evening
i
left
timothy
in
charge
and
repaired
to
her
house
it
was
very
respectable
in
outward
appearance
as
well
as
its
furniture
i
was
not
however
shown
up
into
the
first
floor
but
into
the
room
below
miss
judd
will
come
directly
sir
said
a
tall
meagre
puritanical
looking
maid
shutting
the
door
upon
me
in
a
few
minutes
during
which
my
pulse
beat
quick
for
i
could
not
but
expect
some
disclosure
whether
it
was
to
be
one
of
love
or
murder
i
hardly
knew
which
miss
aramathea
judd
for
such
was
her
christian
name
made
her
appearance
and
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
requested
me
to
take
a
seat
by
her
mr
newland
said
she
i
wish
to
and
i
think
i
can
entrust
you
with
a
secret
most
important
to
me
why
i
am
obliged
to
do
it
you
will
perfectly
comprehend
when
you
have
heard
my
story
tell
me
are
you
attached
to
me
this
was
a
home
question
to
a
forward
lad
of
sixteen
i
took
her
by
the
hand
and
when
i
looked
down
on
it
i
felt
as
if
i
was
i
looked
up
into
her
face
and
felt
that
i
was
not
and
as
i
now
was
close
to
her
i
perceived
that
she
must
have
some
aromatic
drug
in
her
mouth
as
it
smelt
strongly
this
gave
me
the
supposition
that
the
breath
which
drew
such
melodious
tones
was
not
equally
sweet
and
i
felt
a
certain
increased
degree
of
disgust
i
am
very
grateful
miss
judd
replied
i
i
hope
i
shall
prove
that
i
am
attached
when
you
confide
in
me
swear
then
by
all
that
sacred
you
will
not
reveal
what
i
do
confide
by
all
that
sacred
i
will
not
replied
i
kissing
her
hand
with
more
fervour
than
i
expected
from
myself
do
me
then
the
favour
to
excuse
me
one
minute
she
left
the
room
and
in
a
very
short
time
there
returned
in
the
same
dress
and
in
every
other
point
the
same
person
but
with
a
young
and
lively
face
of
not
more
apparently
than
or
years
old
i
started
as
if
i
had
seen
an
apparition
yes
said
she
smiling
you
now
see
aramathea
judd
without
disguise
and
you
are
the
first
who
has
seen
that
face
for
more
than
two
years
before
i
proceed
further
again
i
say
may
i
trust
you
swear
i
do
swear
replied
i
and
took
her
hand
for
the
book
which
this
time
i
kissed
with
pleasure
over
and
over
again
like
a
young
jackass
as
i
was
i
still
retained
her
hand
throwing
as
much
persuasion
as
i
possibly
could
in
my
eyes
in
fact
i
did
enough
to
have
softened
the
hearts
of
three
i
began
to
feel
most
dreadfully
in
love
and
thought
of
marriage
and
making
my
fortune
and
i
do
know
what
but
all
this
was
put
an
end
to
by
one
simple
short
sentence
delivered
in
a
very
decided
but
soft
voice
japhet
do
be
silly
i
was
crushed
and
all
my
hopes
crushed
with
me
i
dropped
her
hand
and
sat
like
a
fool
and
now
hear
me
i
am
as
you
must
have
already
found
out
an
impostor
that
is
i
am
what
is
called
a
religious
adventuress
a
new
term
i
grant
and
perhaps
only
applicable
to
a
very
few
my
aunt
was
considered
by
a
certain
sect
to
be
a
great
prophetess
which
i
hardly
need
tell
you
was
all
nonsense
nevertheless
there
are
hundreds
who
believed
in
her
and
do
so
now
brought
up
with
my
aunt
i
soon
found
out
what
fools
and
dupes
may
be
made
of
mankind
by
taking
advantage
of
their
credulity
she
had
her
religious
inspirations
her
trances
and
her
convulsions
and
i
was
always
behind
the
scenes
she
confided
in
me
and
i
may
say
that
i
was
her
only
confidant
you
can
not
therefore
wonder
at
my
practising
that
deceit
to
which
i
have
been
brought
up
from
almost
my
infancy
in
person
i
am
the
exact
counterpart
of
what
my
aunt
was
at
my
age
equally
so
in
figure
although
my
figure
is
now
disguised
to
resemble
that
of
a
woman
of
her
age
i
often
had
dressed
myself
in
my
aunt
clothes
put
on
her
cap
and
front
and
then
the
resemblance
was
very
striking
my
aunt
fell
sick
and
died
but
she
promised
the
disciples
that
she
would
to
them
and
they
believed
her
i
did
not
she
was
buried
and
by
many
her
return
was
anxiously
expected
it
occurred
to
me
about
a
week
afterwards
that
i
might
contrive
to
deceive
them
i
dressed
in
my
aunt
clothes
i
painted
and
disguised
my
face
as
you
have
seen
and
the
deception
was
complete
even
to
myself
as
i
surveyed
my
countenance
in
the
glass
i
boldly
set
off
in
the
evening
to
the
tabernacle
which
i
knew
they
still
frequented
came
into
the
midst
of
them
and
they
fell
down
and
worshipped
me
as
a
prophetess
risen
from
the
dead
deceived
indeed
by
my
appearance
but
still
more
deceived
by
their
own
credulity
for
two
years
i
have
been
omnipotent
with
them
but
there
is
one
difficulty
which
shakes
the
faith
of
the
new
converts
and
new
converts
i
must
have
japhet
as
the
old
ones
die
or
i
should
not
be
able
to
fee
my
physician
it
is
this
by
habit
i
can
almost
throw
myself
into
a
stupor
or
a
convulsion
but
to
do
that
effectually
to
be
able
to
carry
on
the
deception
for
so
long
a
time
and
to
undergo
the
severe
fatigue
attending
such
violent
exertion
it
is
necessary
that
i
have
recourse
to
stimulants
do
you
understand
i
do
replied
i
i
have
more
than
once
thought
you
under
the
influence
of
them
towards
the
evening
i
afraid
that
you
take
more
than
is
good
for
your
health
not
more
than
i
require
for
what
i
have
to
undergo
to
keep
up
the
faith
of
my
disciples
but
there
are
many
who
waver
some
who
doubt
and
i
find
that
my
movements
are
watched
i
can
not
trust
the
woman
in
this
house
i
think
she
is
a
spy
set
upon
me
but
i
can
not
remove
her
as
this
house
and
all
which
it
contains
are
not
mine
but
belong
to
the
disciples
in
general
there
is
another
woman
not
far
off
who
is
my
rival
she
calls
me
an
impostor
and
says
that
she
is
the
true
prophetess
and
that
i
am
not
one
this
will
be
rather
difficult
for
her
to
prove
continued
she
with
a
mocking
smile
beset
as
i
am
i
require
your
assistance
for
you
must
be
aware
that
it
is
rather
discreditable
to
a
prophetess
who
has
risen
from
the
dead
to
be
seen
all
day
at
the
yet
without
stimulants
now
i
could
not
exist
and
how
can
i
assist
you
by
sending
me
as
medicine
that
which
i
dare
no
longer
procure
in
any
other
way
and
keeping
the
secret
which
i
have
imparted
i
will
do
both
with
pleasure
but
yet
said
i
is
it
not
a
pity
a
thousand
pities
that
one
so
young
and
if
you
will
allow
me
to
add
so
lovely
should
give
herself
up
to
ardent
spirits
why
continued
i
taking
her
small
white
hand
why
should
you
carry
on
the
deception
why
sacrifice
your
health
and
i
may
say
your
happiness
what
more
i
might
have
said
i
know
not
probably
it
might
have
been
an
offer
of
marriage
but
she
cut
me
short
why
does
everybody
sacrifice
their
health
their
happiness
their
all
but
for
ambition
and
the
love
of
power
it
is
true
as
long
as
this
little
beauty
lasts
i
might
be
courted
as
a
woman
but
never
should
i
be
worshipped
as
i
may
say
a
no
no
there
is
something
too
delightful
in
that
adoration
something
too
pleasant
in
witnessing
a
crowd
of
fools
stare
and
men
of
three
times
my
age
falling
down
and
kissing
the
hem
of
my
garment
this
is
indeed
adoration
the
delight
arising
from
it
is
so
great
that
all
other
passions
are
crashed
by
it
it
absorbs
all
other
feelings
and
has
closed
my
heart
even
against
love
japhet
i
could
not
i
would
not
debase
myself
sink
so
low
in
my
own
estimation
as
to
allow
so
paltry
a
passion
to
have
dominion
over
me
and
indeed
now
that
i
am
so
wedded
to
stimulants
even
if
i
were
no
longer
a
prophetess
it
never
could
but
is
not
intoxication
one
of
the
most
debasing
of
all
habits
i
grant
you
in
itself
but
with
me
and
in
my
situation
it
is
different
i
fall
to
rise
again
and
higher
i
can
not
be
what
i
am
without
i
stimulate
i
can
not
stimulate
without
stimulants
therefore
it
is
but
a
means
to
a
great
and
glorious
ambition
i
had
more
conversation
with
her
before
i
left
but
nothing
appeared
to
move
her
resolution
and
i
left
her
lamenting
in
the
first
place
that
she
had
abjured
love
because
notwithstanding
the
orris
root
which
she
kept
in
her
mouth
to
take
away
the
smell
of
the
spirits
i
found
myself
very
much
taken
with
such
beauty
of
person
combined
with
so
much
vigour
of
mind
and
in
the
second
that
one
so
young
should
carry
on
a
system
of
deceit
and
when
i
rose
to
go
away
she
put
five
guineas
in
my
hand
to
enable
me
to
purchase
what
she
required
add
to
this
one
small
favour
said
i
aramathea
allow
me
a
kiss
a
kiss
replied
she
with
scorn
no
japhet
look
upon
me
for
it
is
the
last
time
you
will
behold
my
youth
look
upon
me
as
a
sepulchre
fair
without
but
unsavoury
and
rottenness
within
let
me
do
you
a
greater
kindness
let
me
awaken
your
dormant
energies
and
plant
that
ambition
in
your
soul
which
may
lead
to
all
that
is
great
and
good
a
better
path
and
more
worthy
of
a
man
than
the
one
which
i
have
partly
chosen
and
partly
destiny
has
decided
for
me
look
upon
me
as
your
friend
although
perhaps
you
truly
say
no
friend
unto
myself
farewell
remember
that
you
will
send
the
medicine
which
i
require
i
left
her
and
returned
home
it
was
late
i
went
to
bed
and
having
disclosed
as
much
to
timothy
as
i
could
safely
venture
to
do
i
fell
fast
asleep
but
her
figure
and
her
voice
haunted
me
in
my
dreams
at
one
time
she
appeared
before
me
in
her
painted
enamelled
face
and
then
the
mask
fell
off
and
i
fell
at
her
feet
to
worship
her
extreme
beauty
then
her
beauty
would
vanish
and
she
would
appear
an
image
of
loathsomeness
and
deformity
and
i
felt
suffocated
with
the
atmosphere
impregnated
with
the
smell
of
liquor
i
would
wake
and
compose
myself
again
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
horrid
dream
but
again
would
she
appear
with
a
hydra
tail
like
sin
in
milton
paradise
lost
wind
herself
round
me
her
beautiful
face
gradually
changing
into
that
of
a
skeleton
i
cried
out
with
terror
and
awoke
to
sleep
no
more
and
effectually
cured
by
my
dream
of
the
penchant
which
i
felt
towards
miss
aramathea
judd
part
one
chapter
six
my
prescriptions
very
effective
and
palatable
but
i
lose
my
patient
the
feud
equal
to
that
of
the
montagues
and
the
capulets
results
different
mercutio
comes
off
unhurt
the
next
day
i
sent
timothy
to
purchase
some
highly
rectified
white
brandy
which
i
coloured
with
a
blue
tincture
and
added
to
it
a
small
proportion
of
the
essence
of
cinnamon
to
disguise
the
smell
a
dozen
large
vials
carefully
tied
up
and
sealed
were
despatched
to
her
abode
she
now
seldom
called
unless
it
was
early
in
the
morning
i
made
repeated
visits
to
her
house
to
receive
money
but
no
longer
to
make
love
one
day
i
requested
permission
to
be
present
at
their
meeting
and
to
this
she
gave
immediate
consent
indeed
we
were
on
the
most
intimate
terms
and
when
she
perceived
that
i
no
longer
attempted
to
play
the
fool
i
was
permitted
to
remain
for
hours
with
her
in
conversation
she
had
as
she
told
me
she
intended
and
painted
her
face
but
knowing
what
beauty
was
concealed
underneath
i
no
longer
felt
any
disgust
timothy
was
very
much
pleased
at
his
share
of
this
arrangement
as
he
seldom
brought
her
the
medicine
without
pocketing
for
two
or
three
months
everything
went
on
very
satisfactorily
but
one
evening
timothy
who
had
been
sent
with
the
basket
of
vials
for
miss
judd
assistance
returned
in
great
consternation
informing
me
that
the
house
was
empty
he
had
inquired
of
the
neighbours
and
from
the
accounts
given
which
were
very
contradictory
it
appeared
that
the
rival
prophetess
had
marched
up
at
the
head
of
her
proselytes
the
evening
before
had
obtained
entrance
and
that
a
desperate
contention
had
been
the
result
that
the
police
had
been
called
in
and
all
parties
had
been
lodged
in
the
that
the
whole
affair
was
being
investigated
by
the
magistrates
and
that
it
was
said
that
miss
judd
and
all
her
coadjutors
would
be
sent
to
the
penitentiary
this
was
quite
enough
to
frighten
two
boys
like
us
for
days
afterwards
we
trembled
when
people
came
into
the
shop
expecting
to
be
summoned
and
imprisoned
gradually
however
our
fears
were
dismissed
but
i
never
from
that
time
heard
anything
more
of
miss
aramathea
judd
after
this
affair
i
adhered
steadily
to
my
business
and
profiting
by
the
advice
given
me
by
that
young
person
improved
rapidly
in
my
profession
as
well
as
in
general
knowledge
but
my
thoughts
as
usual
were
upon
one
subject
my
parentage
and
the
mystery
hanging
over
it
my
eternal
reveries
became
at
last
so
painful
that
i
had
recourse
to
reading
to
drive
them
away
and
subscribing
to
a
good
circulating
library
i
was
seldom
without
a
book
in
my
hand
by
this
time
i
had
been
nearly
two
years
and
a
half
with
mr
cophagus
when
an
adventure
occurred
which
i
must
attempt
to
describe
with
all
the
dignity
with
which
it
ought
to
be
invested
this
is
a
world
of
ambition
competition
and
rivalry
nation
rivals
nation
and
flies
to
arms
cutting
the
throats
of
a
few
thousands
on
each
side
till
one
finds
that
it
has
the
worst
of
it
man
rivals
man
and
hence
detraction
duels
and
individual
death
woman
rivals
woman
and
hence
loss
of
reputation
and
position
in
high
and
loss
of
hair
and
fighting
with
pattens
in
low
life
are
we
then
to
be
surprised
that
this
universal
passion
undeterred
by
the
smell
of
drugs
and
poisonous
compounds
should
enter
into
apothecaries
shops
but
two
streets
two
very
short
streets
from
our
own
was
situated
the
shop
of
mr
ebenezer
pleggit
thank
heaven
it
was
only
there
at
least
we
had
the
ascendency
over
them
upon
other
points
our
advantages
were
more
equally
balanced
mr
pleggit
had
two
large
coloured
bottles
in
his
windows
more
than
we
had
but
then
we
had
two
horses
and
he
had
only
one
he
tied
over
the
corks
of
his
bottles
with
paper
we
covered
up
the
lips
of
our
vials
with
delicate
blue
it
certainly
was
the
case
for
though
an
enemy
i
do
him
justice
that
after
mr
brookes
had
left
us
mr
pleggit
had
two
shopmen
and
mr
cophagus
only
one
but
then
that
one
was
mr
japhet
newland
besides
one
of
his
assistants
had
only
one
eye
the
other
squinted
horribly
so
if
we
measured
by
eyes
i
think
the
advantage
was
actually
on
our
side
and
as
far
as
ornament
went
most
decidedly
for
who
would
not
prefer
putting
on
his
one
handsome
elegant
vase
than
two
damaged
pieces
of
crockery
mr
pleggit
had
certainly
a
gilt
mortar
and
pestle
over
his
door
which
mr
cophagus
had
omitted
when
he
furnished
his
shop
but
then
the
mortar
had
a
great
crack
down
the
middle
and
the
pestle
had
lost
its
knob
and
let
me
ask
those
who
have
been
accustomed
to
handle
it
what
is
a
pestle
without
a
knob
on
the
whole
i
think
with
the
advantage
of
having
two
fronts
like
janus
we
certainly
had
the
best
of
the
comparison
but
i
shall
leave
the
impartial
to
decide
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
feuds
of
the
rival
houses
were
most
bitter
the
hate
intense
the
mutual
scorn
unmeasurable
did
mr
ebenezer
pleggit
meet
mr
phineas
cophagus
in
the
street
the
former
immediately
began
to
spit
as
if
he
had
swallowed
some
of
his
own
vile
adulterated
drugs
and
in
rejoinder
mr
cophagus
immediately
raised
the
cane
from
his
nose
high
above
his
forehead
in
so
threatening
an
attitude
as
almost
to
warrant
the
other
swearing
the
peace
against
him
muttering
ugly
puppy
knows
nothing
um
patients
die
and
so
on
it
may
be
well
supposed
that
this
spirit
of
enmity
extended
through
the
lower
branches
of
the
rival
houses
the
assistants
and
i
were
at
deadly
feud
and
this
feud
was
even
more
deadly
between
the
boys
who
carried
out
the
medicines
and
whose
baskets
might
in
some
measure
have
been
looked
upon
as
the
rival
ensigns
of
the
parties
they
themselves
occupying
the
dangerous
and
honourable
post
of
standard
bearers
timothy
although
the
fellow
in
the
world
was
as
good
a
hater
as
dr
johnson
himself
could
have
wished
to
meet
with
and
when
sometimes
his
basket
was
not
so
well
filled
as
usual
he
would
fill
it
up
with
empty
bottles
below
rather
than
that
the
credit
of
the
house
should
be
suspected
and
his
deficiencies
create
a
smile
of
scorn
in
the
mouth
of
his
antagonist
when
they
happened
to
meet
going
their
rounds
as
yet
no
actual
collision
had
taken
place
between
either
the
principals
or
the
subordinates
of
the
hostile
factions
but
it
was
fated
that
this
state
of
quiescence
should
no
longer
remain
homer

sung
the
battles
of
gods
demigods
and
heroes
milton
the
strife
of
angels
swift
has
been
great
in
his
battle
of
the
books
but
i
am
not
aware
that
the
battle
of
the
vials
has
as
yet
been
sung
and
it
requires
a
greater
genius
than
was
to
be
found
in
those
who
portrayed
the
conflicts
of
heroes
demigods
gods
angels
or

to
do
adequate
justice
to
the
mortal
strife
which
took
place
between
the
lotions

draughts
pills
and
embrocations
i
must
tell
the
story
as
well
as
i
can
leaving
it
as
an
outline
for
a
future
epic
burning
with
all
the
hate
which
infuriated
the
breasts
of
the
two
houses
of
capulet
and
montagu
hate
each
day
increasing
from
years
of
biting
thumbs
at
each
other
and
yet
no
excuse
presenting
itself
for
an
affray
timothy
oldmixon
for
on
such
an
occasion
it
would
be
a
sin
to
omit
his
whole
designation
timothy
oldmixon
i
say
burning
with
hate
and
eager
with
haste
turning
a
corner
of
the
street
with
his
basket
well
filled
with
medicines
hanging
on
his
left
arm
encountered
equally
eager
in
his
haste
and
equally
burning
in
his
hate
the
mercury
of
mr
ebenezer
pleggit
great
was
the
concussion
of
the
opposing
baskets
dire
was
the
crash
of
many
of
the
vials
and
dreadful
was
the
mingled
odour
of
the
abominations
which
escaped
and
poured
through
the
wicker
interstices
two
ladies
from
billingsgate
who
were
near
indulging
their
rhetorical
powers
stopped
short
two
who
were
on
an
adjacent
roof
just
fixing
their
eyes
of
enmity
and
about
to
fix
their
claws
turned
their
eyes
to
the
scene
below
two
political
antagonists
stopped
their
noisy
arguments
two
dustmen
ceased
to
ring
their
bells
and
two
little
urchins
eating
cherries
from
the
crowns
of
their
hats
lost
sight
of
their
fruit
and
stood
aghast
with
fear
they
met
and
met
with
such
violence
that
they
each
rebounded
many
paces
but
like
stalwart
knights
each
kept
his
basket
and
his
feet
a
few
seconds
to
recover
breath
one
withering
fiery
look
from
timothy
returned
by
his
antagonist
one
flash
of
the
memory
in
each
to
tell
them
that
they
each
had
the
on
their
side
and
take
that
was
roared
by
timothy
planting
a
blow
with
his
dexter
and
dexterous
hand
upon
the
sinister
and
sinisterous
eye
of
his
opponent
take
that
continued
he
as
his
adversary
reeled
back
take
that
and
be
damned
to
you
for
running
against
a
he
of
the
rubicund
hair
had
retreated
because
so
violent
was
the
blow
he
could
not
help
so
doing
and
we
all
must
yield
to
fate
but
it
was
not
from
fear
seizing
a
vile
potation
that
was
labelled
to
be
taken
immediately
and
hurling
it
with
demoniacal
force
right
on
the
chops
of
the
courageous
timothy
take
that
cried
he
with
a
rancorous
yell
this
missile
as
the
spears
of
homer
heroes
came
full
upon
the
bridge
of
timothy
nose
and
the
fragile
glass
shivering
inflicted
divers
wounds
upon
his
physiognomy
and
at
the
same
time
poured
forth
a
dark
balsam
to
heal
them
giving
pain
unutterable
timothy
disdaining
to
lament
the
agony
of
his
wounds
followed
the
example
of
his
antagonist
and
hastily
seizing
a
similar
bottle
of
much
larger
dimensions
threw
it
with
such
force
that
it
split
between
the
eyes
of
his
opponent
thus
with
these
dreadful
weapons
did
they
commence
the
mortal
strife
the
lovers
of
or
at
least
of
fair
play
gathered
round
the
combatants
forming
an
almost
impregnable
ring
yet
of
sufficient
dimensions
to
avoid
the
missiles
it
resounded
on
every
side
draughts
now
met
draughts
in
their
passage
through
the
circumambient
air
and
exploded
like
shells
over
a
besieged
town
bolusses
were
fired
with
the
precision
of
cannon
shot
were
thrown
with
such
force
that
they
burst
like
grape
and
cannister
while
acids
and
alkalies
hissed
as
they
neutralised
each
other
power
with
all
the
venom
of
expiring
snakes
bravo
for
ever
resounded
on
every
side
as
the
conflict
continued
with
unabated
vigour
the
ammunition
was
fast
expending
on
both
sides
when
mr
ebenezer
pleggit
hearing
the
noise
and
perhaps
smelling
his
own
drugs
was
so
unfortunately
rash
and
so
unwisely
foolhardy
as
to
break
through
the
sacred
ring
advancing
from
behind
with
uplifted
cane
to
fell
the
redoubtable
timothy
when
a
mixture
of
his
own
hurled
by
his
own
champion
caught
him
in
his
open
mouth
breaking
against
his
only
two
remaining
front
teeth
extracting
them
as
the
discharged
liquid
ran
down
his
throat
and
turning
him
as
sick
as
a
dog
he
fell
was
taken
away
on
a
shutter
and
it
was
some
days
before
he
was
again
to
be
seen
in
his
shop
dispensing
those
medicines
which
on
this
fatal
occasion
he
would
but
too
gladly
have
dispensed
with
reader
have
you
not
elsewhere
read
in
the
mortal
fray
between
knights
when
the
casque
has
been
beaten
off
the
shield
lost
and
the
sword
shivered
how
they
have
resorted
to
closer
and
more
deadly
strife
with
their
daggers
raised
on
high
thus
it
was
with
timothy
his
means
had
failed
and
disdaining
any
longer
to
wage
a
distant
combat
he
closed
vigorously
with
his
panting
enemy
overthrew
him
in
the
first
struggle
seizing
from
his
basket
the
only
weapons
which
remained
one
single
vial
and
one
single
box
of
pills
as
he
sat
upon
his
prostrate
foe
first
he
forced
the
box
of
pills
into
his
gasping
mouth
and
then
with
the
lower
end
of
the
vial
he
drove
it
down
his
throat
as
a
gunner
rams
home
the
wad
and
shot
into
a
pound
carronade
choked
with
the
box
the
fallen
knight
held
up
his
hands
for
quarter
but
timothy
continued
until
the
end
of
the
vial
breaking
out
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
pasteboard
receptacle
of
antibilious
pills
rolled
in
haste
down
throat
timothy
then
seized
his
basket
and
amid
the
shouts
of
triumph
walked
away
his
adversary
coughed
up
the
remnants
of
the
pasteboard
once
more
breathed
and
was
led
disconsolate
to
the
neighbouring
pump
while
timothy
regained
our
shop
with
his
blushing
honours
thick
upon
him
but
i
must
drop
the
vein
heroical
mr
cophagus
who
was
at
home
when
timothy
returned
was
at
first
very
much
inclined
to
be
wroth
at
the
loss
of
so
much
medicine
but
when
he
heard
the
story
and
the
finale
he
was
so
pleased
at
tim
double
victory
over
mr
pleggit
and
his
messenger
that
he
actually
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
mr
pleggit
on
the
contrary
was
anything
but
pleased
he
went
to
a
lawyer
and
commenced
an
action
for
assault
and
battery
and
all
the
neighbourhood
did
nothing
but
talk
about
the
affray
which
had
taken
place
and
the
action
at
law
which
it
was
said
would
take
place
in
the
ensuing
term
but
with
the
exception
of
this
fracas
which
ended
in
the
action
not
holding
good
whereby
the
animosity
was
increased
i
have
little
to
recount
during
the
remainder
of
the
time
i
served
under
mr
cophagus
i
had
been
more
than
three
years
with
him
when
my
confinement
became
insupportable
i
had
but
one
idea
which
performed
an
everlasting
cycle
in
my
brain
who
was
my
father
and
i
should
have
abandoned
the
profession
to
search
the
world
in
the
hope
of
finding
my
progenitor
had
it
not
been
that
i
was
without
the
means
latterly
i
had
hoarded
up
all
i
could
collect
but
the
sum
was
small
much
too
small
for
the
proposed
expedition
i
became
melancholy
indifferent
to
the
business
and
slovenly
in
my
appearance
when
a
circumstance
occurred
which
put
an
end
to
my
further
dispensing
medicines
and
left
me
a
free
agent
part
one
chapter
seven
looking
out
for
business
not
exactly
minding
your
own
business
the
loss
of
the
scales
occasions
the
loss
of
place
to
timothy
and
me
who
when
weighed
in
other
scales
were
found
wanting
we
bundle
off
with
our
bundles
on
it
happened
one
that
there
was
an
overdriven
infuriated
beast
which
was
making
sad
havoc
crowds
of
people
were
running
past
our
shop
in
one
direction
and
the
cries
of
mad
bull
were
in
every
quarter
mr
cophagus
who
was
in
the
shop
and
to
whom
as
i
have
before
observed
a
mad
bull
was
a
source
of
great
profit
very
naturally
looked
out
of
the
shop
to
ascertain
whether
the
animal
was
near
to
us
in
most
other
countries
when
people
hear
of
any
danger
they
generally
avoid
it
by
increasing
their
distance
but
in
england
it
is
too
often
the
case
that
they
are
so
fond
of
indulging
their
curiosity
that
they
run
to
the
danger
mr
cophagus
who
perceived
the
people
running
one
way
naturally
supposed
not
being
aware
of
the
extreme
proximity
of
the
animal
that
the
people
were
running
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
turned
his
eyes
in
that
direction
walking
out
on
the
pavement
that
he
might
have
a
fairer
view
he
was
just
observing
ca
say
fear
um
rascal
pleggit
close
to
him
get
all
the
custom
wounds
contusions
and
when
the
animal
came
suddenly
round
the
corner
upon
mr
cophagus
who
had
his
eyes
the
other
way
and
before
he
could
escape
tossed
him
through
his
own
shop
windows
and
landed
him
on
the
counter
not
satisfied
with
this
the
beast
followed
him
into
the
shop
timothy
and
i
pulled
mr
cophagus
over
towards
us
and
he
dropped
inside
the
counter
where
we
also
crouched
frightened
out
of
our
wits
to
our
great
horror
the
bull
made
one
or
two
attempts
to
leap
the
counter
but
not
succeeding
and
being
now
attacked
by
the
dogs
and
butcher
boys
he
charged
at
them
through
the
door
carrying
away
our
best
scales
on
his
horns
as
a
trophy
as
he
galloped
out
of
the
shop
in
pursuit
of
his
persecutors
when
the
shouts
and
hallooes
were
at
some
little
distance
timothy
and
i
raised
our
heads
and
looked
round
us
and
perceiving
that
all
was
safe
we
proceeded
to
help
mr
cophagus
who
remained
on
the
floor
bleeding
and
in
a
state
of
insensibility
we
carried
him
into
the
back
parlour
and
laid
him
on
the
sofa
i
desired
timothy
to
run
for
surgical
aid
as
fast
as
he
could
while
i
opened
a
vein
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
with
our
opponent
mr
ebenezer
pleggit
we
stripped
mr
cophagus
and
proceeded
to
examine
him
bad
case
this
very
bad
case
indeed
mr
newland
dislocation
of
the
os
humeri
severe
contusion
on
the
os
frontis
and
i
very
much
afraid
there
is
some
intercostal
injury
very
sorry
very
sorry
indeed
for
my
brother
cophagus
but
mr
pleggit
did
not
appear
to
be
sorry
on
the
contrary
he
appeared
to
perform
his
surgical
duties
with
the
greatest
glee
we
reduced
the
dislocation
and
then
carried
mr
cophagus
up
to
his
bed
in
an
hour
he
was
sensible
and
mr
pleggit
took
his
departure
shaking
hands
with
mr
cophagus
and
wishing
him
joy
of
his
providential
escape
bad
job
japhet
said
mr
cophagus
to
me
very
bad
indeed
sir
but
it
might
have
been
worse
worse
um
no
nothing
worse
not
possible
why
sir
you
might
have
been
killed
pooh
did
mean
that
mean
pleggit
rascal
um
kill
me
if
he
can
sha
though
soon
get
rid
of
him
and
so
on
you
will
not
require
his
further
attendance
now
that
your
shoulder
is
reduced
i
can
very
well
attend
upon
you
very
true
japhet
but
wo
go
sure
of
that
damned
rascal
quite
pleased
i
saw
it
um
eyes
twinkled
smile
checked
and
so
on
that
evening
mr
pleggit
called
in
as
mr
cophagus
said
that
he
would
and
the
latter
showed
a
great
deal
of
impatience
but
mr
pleggit
repeated
his
visits
over
and
over
again
and
i
observed
that
mr
cophagus
no
longer
made
any
objection
on
the
contrary
seemed
anxious
for
his
coming
and
still
more
so
after
he
was
convalescent
and
able
to
sit
at
his
table
but
the
mystery
was
soon
divulged
it
appeared
that
mr
cophagus
although
he
was
very
glad
that
other
people
should
suffer
from
mad
bulls
and
come
to
be
cured
viewed
the
case
in
a
very
different
light
when
the
bull
thought
proper
to
toss
him
and
having
now
realised
a
comfortable
independence
he
had
resolved
to
retire
from
business
and
from
a
site
attended
with
so
much
danger
a
hint
of
this
escaping
him
when
mr
pleggit
was
attending
him
on
the
third
day
after
his
accident
the
latter
who
knew
the
value
of
the
also
hinted
that
if
mr
cophagus
was
inclined
so
to
do
that
he
would
be
most
happy
to
enter
into
an
arrangement
with
him
will
not
only
change
friendship
into
enmity
in
this
rascally
world
but
also
turn
enmity
into
friendship
all
mr
pleggit
enormities
and
all
mr
cophagus
shameful
conduct
were
mutually
forgotten
in
less
than
ten
minutes
it
was
dear
mr
and
so
on
and
dear
brother
in
three
weeks
everything
had
been
arranged
between
them
and
the
shop
fixtures
stock
in
trade
and
good
will
were
all
the
property
of
our
ancient
antagonist
but
although
mr
pleggit
could
shake
hands
with
mr
cophagus
for
his
fixtures
and
yet
as
timothy
and
i
were
not
included
in
the
neither
were
we
included
among
the
and
mr
cophagus
could
not
of
course
interfere
with
mr
pleggit
private
arrangements
he
did
all
he
could
do
in
the
way
of
recommendation
but
mr
pleggit
had
not
forgotten
my
occasional
impertinences
or
the
battle
of
the
bottles
i
really
believe
that
his
against
timothy
was
one
reason
for
purchasing
the
of
mr
cophagus
and
we
were
very
gently
told
by
mr
pleggit
that
he
would
have
no
occasion
for
our
services
mr
cophagus
offered
to
procure
me
another
situation
as
soon
as
he
could
and
at
the
same
time
presented
me
with
twenty
guineas
as
a
proof
of
his
regard
and
appreciation
of
my
conduct
but
this
sum
put
in
my
hand
decided
me
i
thanked
him
and
told
him
i
had
other
views
at
present
but
hoped
he
would
let
me
know
where
i
might
find
him
hereafter
as
i
should
be
glad
to
see
him
again
he
told
me
he
would
leave
his
address
for
me
at
the
foundling
hospital
and
shaking
me
heartily
by
the
hand
we
parted
timothy
was
then
summoned
mr
cophagus
gave
him
five
guineas
and
wished
him
good
fortune
and
now
japhet
what
are
you
about
to
do
said
timothy
as
he
descended
into
the
shop
to
do
replied
i
i
am
about
to
leave
you
which
is
the
only
thing
i
am
sorry
for
i
am
going
timothy
in
search
of
my
father
well
replied
timothy
i
feel
as
you
do
japhet
that
it
will
be
hard
to
part
and
there
is
another
thing
on
my
mind
which
is
i
am
very
sorry
that
the
bull
did
not
break
the
rudimans
pointing
to
the
iron
mortar
and
pestle
had
he
had
but
half
the
spite
i
have
against
it
he
would
not
have
left
a
piece
as
big
as
a
thimble
i
a
great
mind
to
have
a
smack
at
it
before
i
go
you
will
only
injure
mr
cophagus
for
the
mortar
will
not
then
be
paid
for
very
true
and
as
he
has
just
given
me
five
guineas
i
will
refrain
from
my
just
indignation
but
now
japhet
let
me
speak
to
you
i
do
know
how
you
feel
but
i
feel
as
if
i
could
not
part
with
you
i
do
not
want
to
go
in
search
of
my
father
particularly
they
say
it
a
wise
child
that
knows
its
own
father
but
as
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
my
other
parent
if
i
can
only
hit
upon
her
i
have
a
strong
inclination
to
go
in
search
of
my
mother
and
if
you
like
my
company
why
i
will
go
with
you
always
my
dear
japhet
continued
tim
keeping
in
my
mind
the
great
difference
between
a
person
who
has
been
fee
as
an
and
a
lad
who
only
carries
out
his
prescriptions
do
you
really
mean
to
say
tim
that
you
will
go
with
me
yes
to
the
end
of
the
world
japhet
as
your
companion
your
friend
and
your
servant
if
you
require
it
i
love
you
japhet
and
i
will
serve
you
faithfully
my
dear
tim
i
am
delighted
now
i
am
really
happy
we
will
have
but
one
purse
and
but
one
interest
if
i
find
good
fortune
you
shall
share
it
and
if
you
meet
with
ill
luck
i
will
share
that
too
so
the
affair
is
settled
and
as
here
comes
mr
pleggit
assistants
with
only
one
pair
of
eyes
between
them
the
sooner
we
pack
up
the
better
in
half
an
hour
all
was
ready
a
bundle
each
contained
our
wardrobes
we
descended
from
our
attic
walked
proudly
through
the
shop
without
making
any
observation
or
taking
any
notice
of
our
successors
all
the
notice
taken
was
by
timothy
who
turned
round
and
shook
his
fist
at
his
old
enemies
the
iron
mortar
and
pestle
and
there
we
were
standing
on
the
pavement
with
the
wide
world
before
us
and
quite
undecided
which
way
we
should
go
is
it
to
be
east
west
north
or
south
japhet
said
timothy
the
wise
men
came
from
the
east
replied
i
then
they
must
have
travelled
west
said
tim
let
us
show
our
wisdom
by
doing
the
same
agreed
passing
by
a
small
shop
we
purchased
two
good
sticks
as
defenders
as
well
as
to
hang
our
bundles
on
and
off
we
set
upon
our
pilgrimage
part
one
chapter
eight
we
take
a
coach
but
the
driver
does
not
like
his
fare
and
hits
us
foul
we
change
our
mode
of
travelling
upon
the
principle
of
slow
and
sure
and
fall
in
with
a
very
learned
man
i
believe
it
to
be
a
very
general
custom
when
people
set
off
upon
a
journey
to
reckon
up
their
means
that
is
to
count
the
money
which
they
may
have
in
their
pockets
at
all
events
this
was
done
by
timothy
and
me
and
i
found
that
my
stock
amounted
to
pounds
eighteen
shillings
and
timothy
to
the
five
guineas
presented
by
mr
cophagus
and
three
halfpence
which
were
in
the
corner
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
sum
total
pounds
three
shillings
and
three
halfpence
a
very
handsome
sum
as
we
thought
with
which
to
commence
our
peregrinations
and
as
i
observed
to
timothy
sufficient
to
last
us
for
a
considerable
time
if
husbanded
with
care
yes
replied
he
but
we
must
husband
our
legs
also
japhet
or
we
shall
soon
be
tired
and
very
soon
wear
out
our
shoes
i
vote
we
take
a
take
a
tim
we
must
think
of
it
we
can
not
afford
such
a
luxury
you
ca
be
tired
yet
we
are
now
only
just
clear
of
hyde
park
corner
still
i
think
we
had
better
take
a
coach
japhet
and
here
is
one
coming
i
always
do
take
one
when
i
carry
out
medicines
to
make
up
for
the
time
i
lose
looking
at
the
shops
and
playing
peg
in
the
ring
i
now
understood
what
timothy
meant
which
was
to
get
behind
and
have
a
ride
for
nothing
i
consented
to
this
arrangement
and
we
got
up
behind
one
which
was
already
well
filled
inside
the
only
difference
between
an
inside
and
outside
passenger
in
a
is
that
one
pays
and
the
other
does
not
said
i
to
timothy
as
we
rolled
along
at
the
act
of
parliament
speed
of
four
miles
per
hour
that
depends
upon
circumstances
if
we
are
found
out
in
all
probability
we
shall
not
only
have
our
ride
but
be
into
the
bargain
with
the
coachman
whip
i
presume
exactly
and
timothy
had
hardly
time
to
get
the
word
out
of
his
mouth
when
flac
flac
came
the
whip
across
our
eyes
a
little
envious
wretch
with
his
shirt
hanging
out
of
his
trowsers
having
called
out
not
wishing
to
have
our
faces
or
our
behinds
cut
any
more
we
hastily
descended
and
reached
the
footpath
after
having
gained
about
three
miles
on
the
road
before
we
were
discovered
that
was
a
bad
lift
japhet
and
as
for
the
whip
i
never
mind
that
with
and
now
japhet
i
tell
you
something
we
must
get
into
a
waggon
if
we
can
find
one
going
down
the
road
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
but
that
will
cost
money
tim
it
economy
i
tell
you
for
a
shilling
if
you
bargain
you
may
ride
the
whole
night
and
if
we
stop
at
a
to
sleep
we
shall
have
to
pay
for
our
beds
as
well
as
be
obliged
to
order
something
to
eat
and
pay
dearer
for
it
than
if
we
buy
what
we
want
at
cooks
shops
there
is
sense
in
what
you
say
timothy
we
will
look
out
for
a
waggon
oh
it
no
use
now
waggons
are
like
black
beetles
not
only
in
shape
but
in
habits
they
only
travel
by
night
at
least
most
of
them
do
we
are
now
coming
into
long
dirty
brentford
and
i
do
know
how
you
feel
japhet
but
i
find
that
walking
wonderfully
increases
the
appetite
that
another
reason
why
you
should
not
walk
when
you
can
ride
for
nothing
well
i
rather
hungry
myself
and
dear
me
how
very
good
that
piece
of
roast
pork
looks
in
that
window
i
agree
with
you
let
go
in
and
make
a
bargain
we
bought
a
good
allowance
for
a
shilling
and
after
sticking
out
for
a
greater
proportion
of
mustard
than
the
woman
said
we
were
entitled
to
and
some
salt
we
wrapped
it
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
and
continued
our
course
till
we
arrived
at
a
baker
where
we
purchased
our
bread
and
then
taking
up
a
position
on
a
bench
outside
a
called
for
a
pot
of
beer
and
putting
our
provisions
down
before
us
made
a
hearty
and
what
made
us
more
enjoy
it
an
independent
meal
having
finished
our
pork
and
our
porter
and
refreshed
ourselves
we
again
started
and
walked
till
it
was
quite
dark
when
we
felt
so
tired
that
we
agreed
to
sit
down
on
our
bundles
and
wait
for
the
first
waggon
which
passed
we
soon
heard
the
jingling
of
bells
and
shortly
afterwards
its
enormous
towering
bulk
appeared
between
us
and
the
sky
we
went
up
to
the
waggoner
who
was
mounted
on
a
little
pony
and
asked
him
if
he
could
give
two
poor
lads
a
lift
and
how
much
he
would
charge
us
for
the
ride
how
much
can
ye
afford
to
give
measters
for
there
be
others
as
poor
as
ye
we
replied
that
we
could
give
a
shilling
well
then
get
up
in
god
name
and
ride
as
long
as
you
will
get
in
behind
are
there
many
people
in
there
already
said
i
as
i
climbed
up
and
timothy
handed
me
the
bundles
noa
replied
the
waggoner
there
be
nobody
but
a
mighty
clever
or
doctor
i
ca
tell
which
but
he
wears
an
uncommon
queer
hat
and
he
talk
all
sort
of
doctor
stuff
and
there
be
his
odd
man
and
his
odd
boy
that
be
all
and
there
be
plenty
of
room
and
plenty
clean
stra
after
this
intimation
we
climbed
up
and
gained
a
situation
in
the
rear
of
the
waggon
under
the
cloth
as
the
waggoner
said
there
was
plenty
of
room
and
we
nestled
into
the
straw
without
coming
into
contact
with
the
other
travellers
not
feeling
any
inclination
to
sleep
timothy
and
i
entered
into
conversation
and
had
continued
for
more
than
half
an
hour
supposing
by
their
silence
that
the
other
occupants
of
the
waggon
were
asleep
when
we
were
interrupted
by
a
voice
clear
and
sonorous
as
a
bell
it
would
appear
that
you
are
wanderers
young
men
and
journey
you
know
not
whither
birds
seek
their
nests
when
the
night
falls
beasts

to
their
lairs

it
which
when
translated
means
that
is
the
nature
of
mankind
mascula
me
your
troubles
as
homer
says
i
was
very
much
surprised
at
this
address
my
knowledge
of
the
language
told
me
immediately
that
the
quotations
were
out
of
the
latin
grammar
and
that
all
his
learning
was
pretence
still
there
was
a
novelty
of
style
which
amused
me
and
at
the
same
time
gave
me
an
idea
that
the
speaker
was
an
uncommon
personage
i
gave
timothy
a
nudge
and
then
replied
you
have
guessed
right
most
learned
sir
we
are
as
you
say
wanderers
seeking
our
fortunes
and
trust
yet
to
find
them
still
we
have
a
weary
journey
before
us
hora
somni
as
aristotle
hath
it
which
i
need
not
translate
to
so
learned
a
person
as
yourself
nay
indeed
there
is
no
occasion
yet
am
i
pleased
to
meet
with
one
who
hath
scholarship
replied
the
other
have
you
also
a
knowledge
of
the
greek
no
i
pretend
not
to
greek
it
is
a
pity
that
thou
hast
it
not
for
thou
wouldst
delight
to
commune
with
the
ancients
aesculapius
hath
these
words

which
i
will
translate
for
thee
often
find
what
we
seek
when
we
least
expect
it
may
it
be
so
with
you
my
friend
where
have
you
been
educated
and
what
has
been
your
profession
i
thought
i
risked
little
in
telling
so
i
replied
that
i
had
been
brought
up
as
a
surgeon
and
apothecary
and
had
been
educated
at
a
foundation
school
is
well
replied
he
you
have
then
commenced
your
studies
in
my
glorious
profession
still
have
you
much
to
learn
years
of
toil
under
a
great
master
can
only
enable
you
to
benefit
mankind
as
i
have
done
and
years
of
hardship
and
of
danger
must
be
added
thereunto
to
afford
you
the
means
there
are
many
hidden
secrets
sunt

many
parts
of
the
globe
to
traverse

all
these
have
i
visited
and
many
more
even
now
do
i
journey
to
obtain
more
of
my
invaluable
medicine
gathered
on
the
highest
andes
when
the
moon
is
in
her
perigee
there
i
shall
remain
for
months
among
the
clouds
looking
down
upon
the
great
plain
of
mexico
which
shall
appear
no
larger
than
the
head
of
a
pin
where
the
voice
of
man
is
heard
not

bending
for
months
towards
the
earth
in
suffering
with
the
cold
quod

as
eusebius
hath
it
soon
shall
i
be
borne
away
by
the
howling
winds
towards
the
new
world
where
i
can
obtain
more
of
the
wonderful
medicine
which
i
may
say
never
yet
hath
failed
me
and
which
nothing
but
love
towards
my
race
induces
me
to
gather
at
such
pains
and
risk
indeed
sir
replied
i
amused
with
his
imposition
i
should
like
to
accompany
you
for
as
josephus
says
most
truly
pilulae
duae
post
travel
is
indeed
a
most
delightful
occupation
and
i
would
like
to
run
over
the
whole
world
and
i
would
like
to
follow
you
interrupted
timothy
i
suspect
we
have
commenced
our
already
three
miles
behind
a
ten
on
foot
and
about
two
i
should
think
in
this
waggon
but
as
cophagus
says
crash
many
which
means
are
ups
and
downs
in
this
world
hah
exclaimed
our
companion
he
also
has
the
rudiments
nay
i
hope
i
done
with
the
replied
timothy
is
he
your
follower
inquired
the
man
that
very
much
depends
upon
who
walks
first
replied
timothy
but
whether
or
no
we
hunt
in
couples
i
understand
you
are
companions

me
can
you
roll
pills
can
you
use
the
pestle
and
the
mortar
handle
the
scapula
and
mix
ingredients
i
replied
that
of
course
i
knew
my
profession
well
then
as
we
have
still
some
hours
of
night
let
us
now
obtain
some
rest
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
hath
introduced
us
to
each
other
i
may
then
judge
from
your
countenances
whether
it
is
likely
that
we
may
be
better
acquainted
night
is
the
time
for
repose
as
quintus
curtius
says
bos
fur
atque
sleep
was
made
for
all
my
friends
good
night
part
one
chapter
nine
in
which
the
adventures
in
the
waggon
are
continued
and
we
become
more
puzzled
with
our
new
companions
we
leave
off
talking
latin
and
enter
into
an
engagement
timothy
and
i
took
his
advice
and
were
soon
fast
asleep
i
was
awakened
the
next
morning
by
feeling
a
hand
in
my
pocket
i
seized
it
and
held
it
fast
now
just
let
go
my
hand
will
you
cried
a
lachrymal
voice
i
jumped
up
it
was
broad
daylight
and
looked
at
the
human
frame
to
which
the
hand
was
an
appendix
it
was
a
very
spare
form
of
a
young
man
apparently
about
twenty
years
old
but
without
the
least
sign
of
manhood
on
his
chin
his
face
was
cadaverous
with
large
goggling
eyes
high
cheek
bones
hair
long
and
ragged
reminding
me
of
a
rat
nest
thin
lips
and
ears
large
almost
as
an
elephant
a
more
wretch
in
appearance
i
never
beheld
and
i
continued
to
look
at
him
with
surprise
he
repeated
his
words
with
an
idiotical
expression
just
let
go
my
hand
ca
you
what
business
had
your
hand
in
my
pocket
replied
i
angrily
i
was
feeling
for
my
pocket
handkerchief
replied
the
young
man
i
always
keeps
it
in
my
breeches
pocket
but
not
in
your
neighbour
i
presume
my
neighbour
replied
he
with
a
vacant
stare
well
so
it
is
i
see
now
i
thought
it
was
my
own
i
released
his
hand
he
immediately
put
it
into
his
own
pocket
and
drew
out
his
handkerchief
if
the
rag
deserved
the
appellation
there
said
he
i
told
you
i
put
it
in
that
pocket
i
always
do
and
pray
who
are
you
said
i
as
i
looked
at
his
dress
which
was
a
pair
of
loose
white
turkish
trowsers
and
an
old
spangled
jacket
me
why
i
the
fool
more
knave
than
fool
i
expect
replied
i
still
much
puzzled
with
his
strange
appearance
and
dress
nay
there
you
mistake
said
the
voice
of
last
night
he
is
not
only
a
fool
by
profession
but
one
by
nature
it
is
a
creature
who
serves
me
when
i
would
attract
the
people
strange
in
this
world
that
wisdom
may
cry
in
the
streets
without
being
noticed
yet
folly
will
always
command
a
crowd
during
this
address
i
turned
my
eyes
upon
the
speaker
he
was
an
person
with
white
hair
dressed
in
a
suit
of
black
ruffles
and
frill
his
eyes
were
brilliant
but
the
remainder
of
his
face
it
was
difficult
to
decipher
as
it
was
evidently
painted
and
the
night
jumbling
in
the
waggon
had
so
smeared
it
that
it
appeared
of
almost
every
colour
in
the
rainbow
on
one
side
of
him
lay
a
large
cocked
hat
on
the
other
a
little
lump
of
a
boy
rolled
up
in
the
straw
like
a
marmot
and
still
sound
asleep
timothy
looked
at
me
and
when
he
caught
my
eye
burst
out
into
a
laugh
you
laugh
at
my
appearance
i
presume
said
the
old
man
mildly
i
do
in
truth
replied
timothy
i
never
saw
one
like
you
before
and
i
dare
say
never
shall
again
that
is
possible
yet
probably
if
you
meet
me
again
you
would
not
know
me
among
a
hundred
thousand
replied
timothy
with
increased
mirth
we
shall
see
perhaps
replied
the
quack
doctor
for
such
the
reader
must
have
already
ascertained
to
be
his
profession
but
the
waggon
has
stopped
and
the
driver
will
bait
his
horses
if
inclined
to
eat
now
is
your
time
come
jumbo
get
up
philotas
waken
him
and
follow
me
philotas
for
so
was
the
fool
styled
by
his
master
twisted
up
some
straw
and
stuffed
the
end
of
it
into
jumbo
mouth
now
jumbo
will
think
he
has
got
something
to
eat
i
always
wake
him
that
way
observed
the
fool
grinning
at
us
it
certainly
as
might
be
expected
did
waken
jumbo
who
uncoiled
himself
rubbed
his
eyes
stared
at
the
tilt
of
the
waggon
then
at
us
and
without
saying
a
word
rolled
himself
out
after
the
fool
timothy
and
i
followed
we
found
the
doctor
bargaining
for
some
bread
and
bacon
his
strange
appearance
exciting
much
amusement
and
inducing
the
people
to
let
him
have
a
better
bargain
than
perhaps
otherwise
they
would
have
done
he
gave
a
part
of
the
refreshment
to
the
boy
and
the
fool
and
walked
out
of
the
with
his
own
share
timothy
and
i
went
to
the
pump
and
had
a
good
refreshing
wash
and
then
for
a
shilling
were
permitted
to
make
a
very
hearty
breakfast
the
waggon
having
remained
about
an
hour
the
driver
gave
as
notice
of
his
departure
but
the
doctor
was
nowhere
to
be
found
after
a
little
delay
the
waggoner
drove
off
cursing
him
for
a
and
vowing
that
he
never
have
any
more
to
do
with
a
lamed
man
in
the
mean
time
timothy
and
i
had
taken
our
seats
in
the
waggon
in
company
with
the
fool
and
master
jumbo
we
commenced
a
conversation
with
the
former
and
soon
found
out
as
the
doctor
had
asserted
that
he
really
was
an
idiot
so
much
so
that
it
was
painful
to
converse
with
him
as
for
the
latter
he
had
coiled
himself
away
to
take
a
little
more
sleep
i
forgot
to
mention
that
the
boy
was
dressed
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
fool
in
an
old
spangled
jacket
and
dirty
white
trowsers
for
about
an
hour
timothy
and
i
conversed
remarking
upon
the
strange
disappearance
of
the
doctor
especially
as
he
had
given
us
hopes
of
employing
us
in
accepting
which
offer
if
ever
it
should
be
made
we
had
not
made
up
our
minds
when
we
were
interrupted
with
a
voice
crying
out
hillo
my
man
can
you
give
a
chap
a
lift
as
far
as
reading
for
a
shilling
ay
get
up
and
welcome
replied
the
waggoner
the
waggon
did
not
stop
but
in
a
moment
or
two
the
new
passenger
climbed
in
he
was
dressed
in
a
clean
smock
frock
neatly
worked
up
the
front
leather
gaiters
and
stout
shoes
a
bundle
and
a
stick
were
in
his
hand
he
smiled
as
he
looked
round
upon
the
company
and
showed
a
beautiful
set
of
teeth
his
face
was
dark
and
but
very
handsome
and
his
eyes
as
black
as
coals
and
as
brilliant
as
gas
heh
player
folk
i
a
notion
said
he
as
he
sat
down
looking
at
the
doctor
attendants
and
laughing
at
us
have
you
come
far
gentlemen
continued
he
from
london
was
my
reply
how
do
the
crops
look
up
above
for
down
here
the
turnips
seem
to
have
failed
altogether
dry
seasons
wo
do
for
turnips
i
replied
that
i
really
could
not
satisfy
him
on
that
point
as
it
was
dark
when
we
passed
very
true
i
had
forgotten
that
replied
he
however
the
barleys
look
well
but
perhaps
you
do
understand
farming
i
replied
in
the
negative
and
the
conversation
was
kept
up
for
two
or
three
hours
in
the
course
of
which
i
mentioned
the
quack
doctor
and
his
strange
departure
that
is
the
fellow
who
cured
so
many
people
at
replied
he
and
the
conversation
then
turned
upon
his
profession
and
mode
of
life
which
timothy
and
i
agreed
must
be
very
amusing
we
shall
meet
him
again
i
dare
say
replied
the
man
would
you
know
him
i
think
so
indeed
replied
timothy
laughing
yes
and
so
you
would
think
that
you
would
know
a
guinea
from
a
halfpenny
if
i
put
it
into
your
hands
replied
the
man
i
do
not
wish
to
lay
a
bet
and
win
your
money
but
i
tell
you
that
i
will
put
either
the
one
or
the
other
into
each
of
your
hands
and
if
you
hold
it
fast
for
one
minute
and
shut
your
eyes
during
that
time
you
will
not
be
able
to
tell
me
which
it
is
that
you
have
in
it
that
i
am
sure
i
would
replied
tim
and
i
made
the
same
assertion
well
i
was
taken
in
that
way
at
a
fair
and
lost
ten
shillings
by
the
wager
now
we
try
whether
you
can
tell
or
not
he
took
out
some
money
from
his
pocket
which
he
selected
without
our
seeing
it
put
a
coin
into
the
hand
of
each
of
us
closing
our
fists
over
it
and
now
said
he
keep
your
eyes
shut
for
a
minute
we
did
so
and
a
second
or
two
afterwards
we
heard
a
voice
which
we
instantly
recognised
nay
but
it
was
wrong
to
leave
me
on
the
thus
having
agreed
to
pay
the
sum
demanded
at
my
age
one
walketh
not
without
fatigue
tamen
quaedam
sunt
as
philostratus
says
meaning
old
limbs
lose
their
activity
and
seek
the
help
of
a
crutch
there
the
doctor
cried
timothy
with
his
eyes
still
shut
now
open
your
eyes
said
the
man
and
tell
me
before
you
open
your
hand
what
there
is
in
it
a
halfpenny
in
mine
said
tim
a
guinea
in
mine
replied
i
we
opened
our
hands
and
they
were
where
the
devil
is
it
exclaimed
i
looking
at
tim
and
where
the
devil
the
doctor
replied
he
looking
round
the
money
is
in
the
doctor
pocket
replied
the
man
smiling
then
where
is
the
doctor
pocket
here
replied
he
slapping
his
pocket
and
looking
significantly
at
us
i
thought
you
were
certain
of
knowing
him
again
about
as
certain
as
you
were
of
telling
the
money
in
your
hand
he
then
to
our
astonishment
imitated
the
doctor
voice
and
quoted
syntax
and
timothy
and
i
were
still
in
astonishment
when
he
continued
if
i
had
not
found
out
that
you
were
in
want
of
employ
and
further
that
your
services
would
be
useful
to
me
i
should
not
have
made
this
discovery
do
you
now
think
that
you
know
enough
to
enter
into
my
service
it
is
light
work
and
not
bad
pay
and
now
you
may
choose
i
trust
said
i
that
there
is
no
dishonesty
none
that
you
need
practise
if
you
are
so
scrupulous
perhaps
your
scruples
may
some
day
be
removed
i
make
the
most
of
my
wares
every
merchant
does
the
same
i
practise
upon
the
folly
of
mankind
it
is
on
that
that
wise
men
live
timothy
gave
me
a
push
and
nodded
his
head
for
me
to
give
my
consent
i
reflected
a
few
seconds
and
at
last
i
extended
my
hand
i
consent
replied
i
with
the
reservation
i
have
made
you
will
not
repent
said
he
and
i
will
take
your
companion
not
that
i
want
him
particularly
but
i
do
want
you
the
fact
is
i
want
a
lad
of
gentlemanly
address
and
handsome
appearance
with
the
very
knowledge
you
possess
and
now
we
will
say
no
more
for
the
present
was
that
real
latin
of
yours
no
replied
i
laughing
you
quoted
the
grammar
and
i
replied
with
medical
prescriptions
one
was
as
good
as
the
other
quite
nay
better
for
the
may
find
me
out
but
not
you
but
now
observe
when
we
come
to
the
next
we
must
get
down
at
least
i
expect
so
but
we
shall
know
in
a
minute
in
about
the
time
he
mentioned
a
dark
man
looked
into
the
waggon
and
spoke
to
our
acquaintance
in
an
unknown
language
he
replied
in
the
same
and
the
man
disappeared
we
continued
our
route
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
he
got
out
asked
us
to
follow
him
and
speaking
a
few
words
to
the
fool
which
i
did
not
hear
left
him
and
the
boy
in
the
waggon
we
paid
our
fare
took
possession
of
our
bundles
and
followed
our
new
companion
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
when
he
stopped
and
said
i
must
now
leave
you
to
prepare
for
your
reception
into
our
fraternity
continue
straight
on
this
road
until
you
arrive
at
a
and
wait
there
till
i
come
he
sprang
over
a
stile
and
took
a
direction
verging
at
an
angle
from
the
road
forced
his
way
through
a
hedge
and
disappeared
from
our
sight
upon
my
word
timothy
said
i
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
to
this
have
we
done
right
in
trusting
to
this
man
who
i
am
afraid
is
a
great
rogue
i
do
not
much
like
mixing
with
these
gipsy
people
for
such
i
am
sure
he
belongs
to
i
really
do
not
see
how
we
can
do
better
replied
timothy
the
world
is
all
before
us
and
we
must
force
our
own
way
through
it
as
for
his
being
a
quack
doctor
i
see
no
great
harm
in
that
people
put
their
faith
in
nostrums
more
than
they
do
in
regular
medicines
and
it
is
well
known
that
quack
medicines
as
they
call
them
cure
as
often
as
others
merely
for
that
very
reason
very
true
timothy
the
mind
once
at
ease
the
body
soon
recovers
and
faith
even
in
quack
medicines
will
often
make
people
whole
but
do
you
think
that
he
does
no
more
than
impose
upon
people
in
that
way
he
may
or
he
may
not
at
all
events
we
need
do
no
more
i
suppose
i
am
not
sure
of
that
however
we
shall
see
he
says
we
may
be
useful
to
him
and
i
suppose
we
shall
be
or
he
would
not
have
engaged
us
we
shall
soon
find
out
part
one
chapter
ten
in
which
the
reader
is
introduced
to
several
new
aquaintances
and
all
connected
with
them
except
birth
and
parentage
which
appears
to
be
the
one
thing
wanting
throughout
the
whole
of
this
work
by
this
time
we
had
arrived
at
the
to
which
we
had
been
directed
and
we
sat
down
on
our
bundles
chatting
for
about
five
minutes
when
our
new
acquaintance
made
his
appearance
with
something
in
his
hand
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
you
may
as
well
put
your
coats
into
your
bundles
and
put
on
these
frocks
said
he
you
will
appear
better
among
us
and
be
better
received
for
there
is
a
now
and
some
of
them
are
queer
customers
however
you
have
nothing
to
fear
when
once
you
are
with
my
wife
and
me
you
are
quite
safe
her
little
finger
would
protect
you
from
five
hundred
your
wife
who
then
is
she
inquired
i
as
i
put
my
head
through
the
smock
frock
she
is
a
great
personage
among
the
gipsies
she
is
by
descent
one
of
the
heads
of
the
tribe
and
none
dare
to
disobey
her
and
you
are
you
a
gipsy
no
and
yes
by
birth
i
am
not
but
by
choice
and
marriage
i
am
admitted
but
i
was
not
born
under
a
hedge
i
can
assure
you
although
i
very
often
pass
a
night
there
now
that
is
when
i
am
domestic
but
do
not
think
that
you
are
to
remain
long
here
we
shall
leave
in
a
few
days
and
may
not
meet
the
tribe
again
for
months
although
you
may
see
my
own
family
occasionally
i
did
not
ask
you
to
join
me
to
pass
a
gipsy
life
no
no
we
must
be
stirring
and
active
come
we
are
now
close
to
them
do
not
speak
as
you
pass
the
huts
until
you
have
entered
mine
then
you
may
do
as
you
please
we
turned
short
round
passed
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
and
found
ourselves
on
a
small
retired
piece
of
common
which
was
studded
with
about
twenty
or
thirty
low
gipsy
huts
the
fires
were
alight
and
provisions
apparently
cooking
we
passed
by
nine
or
ten
and
obeyed
our
guide
injunctions
to
keep
silence
at
last
we
stopped
and
perceived
ourselves
to
be
standing
by
the
fool
who
was
dressed
like
us
in
a
smock
frock
and
mr
jumbo
who
was
very
busy
making
the
pot
boil
blowing
at
the
sticks
underneath
till
he
was
black
in
the
face
several
of
the
men
passed
near
us
and
examined
us
with
no
very
pleasant
expression
of
countenance
and
we
were
not
sorry
to
see
our
conductor
who
had
gone
into
the
hut
return
followed
by
a
woman
to
whom
he
was
speaking
in
the
language
of
the
tribe
nattee
bids
you
welcome
said
he
as
she
approached
never
in
my
life
will
the
remembrance
of
the
first
appearance
of
nattee
and
the
effect
it
had
upon
me
be
erased
from
my
memory
she
was
tall
too
tall
had
it
not
been
for
the
perfect
symmetry
of
her
form
her
face
of
a
clear
olive
and
oval
in
shape
her
eyes
jetty
black
nose
straight
and
beautifully
formed
mouth
small
thin
lips
with
a
slight
curl
of
disdain
and
pearly
teeth
i
never
beheld
a
woman
of
so
commanding
a
presence
her
feet
were
bare
but
very
small
as
well
as
her
hands
on
her
fingers
she
wore
many
rings
of
a
curious
old
setting
and
a
piece
of
gold
hung
on
her
forehead
where
the
hair
was
parted
she
looked
at
us
touched
her
high
forehead
with
the
ends
of
her
fingers
and
waving
her
hand
gracefully
said
in
a
soft
voice
you
are
welcome
and
then
turned
to
her
husband
speaking
to
him
in
her
own
language
until
by
degrees
they
separated
from
us
in
earnest
conversation
she
returned
to
us
after
a
short
time
without
her
husband
and
said
in
a
voice
the
notes
of
which
were
indeed
soft
but
the
delivery
of
the
words
was
most
determined
i
have
said
that
you
are
welcome
sit
down
therefore
and
share
with
us
fear
nothing
you
have
no
cause
to
fear
be
faithful
then
while
you
serve
him
and
when
you
would
quit
us
say
so
and
receive
your
leave
to
depart
but
if
you
attempt
to
desert
us
without
permission
then
we
shall
suspect
that
you
are
our
enemies
and
treat
you
accordingly
there
is
your
lodging
while
here
continued
she
pointing
to
another
hut
there
is
but
one
child
with
you
his
boy
pointing
to
jumbo
who
can
lie
at
your
feet
and
now
join
us
as
friends
fleta
where
are
you
a
soft
voice
answered
from
the
tent
of
nattee
and
soon
afterwards
came
out
a
little
girl
of
about
eleven
years
old
the
appearance
of
this
child
was
a
new
source
of
interest
she
was
a
little
fairy
figure
with
a
skin
as
white
as
the
driven
snow
light
auburn
hair
and
large
blue
eyes
her
dress
was
scanty
and
showed
a
large
portion
of
her
taper
legs
she
hastened
to
nattee
and
folding
her
arms
across
her
breast
stood
still
saying
meekly
i
am
here
know
these
as
friends
fleta
send
that
lazy
num
this
was
philotas
the
fool
for
more
wood
and
see
that
jumbo
tends
the
fire
nattee
smiled
and
left
us
i
observed
she
went
to
where
forty
or
fifty
of
the
tribe
were
assembled
in
earnest
discourse
she
took
her
seat
with
them
and
marked
deference
was
paid
to
her
in
the
mean
time
jumbo
had
blown
up
a
brisk
fire
we
were
employed
by
fleta
in
shredding
vegetables
which
she
threw
into
the
boiling
kettle
num
appeared
with
more
fuel
and
at
last
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
fleta
sat
down
by
us
and
parting
her
long
hair
which
had
fallen
over
her
eyes
looked
us
both
in
the
face
who
gave
you
that
name
fleta
inquired
i
they
gave
it
me
replied
she
and
who
are
they
nattee
and
melchior
her
husband
but
you
are
not
their
daughter
no
i
am
not
that
is
i
believe
not
the
little
girl
stopped
short
as
if
assured
that
she
had
said
too
much
cast
her
eyes
down
on
the
ground
and
folded
her
arms
so
that
her
hands
rested
on
each
opposite
shoulder
timothy
whispered
to
me
she
must
have
been
stolen
depend
upon
it
silence
said
i
the
little
girl
overheard
him
and
looking
at
him
put
her
finger
across
her
mouth
looking
to
where
num
and
jumbo
were
sitting
i
felt
an
interest
for
this
child
before
i
had
been
an
hour
in
her
company
she
was
so
graceful
so
feminine
so
mournful
in
the
expression
of
her
countenance
that
she
was
under
restraint
was
evident
but
still
she
did
not
appear
to
be
actuated
by
fear
nattee
was
very
kind
to
her
and
the
child
did
not
seem
to
be
more
reserved
towards
her
than
to
others
her
mournful
pensive
look
was
perhaps
inherent
to
her
nature
it
was
not
until
long
after
our
first
acquaintance
that
i
ever
saw
a
smile
upon
her
features
shortly
after
this
little
conversation
nattee
returned
walking
with
all
the
grace
and
dignity
of
a
queen
her
husband
or
melchior
as
i
shall
in
future
call
him
soon
joined
us
and
we
sat
down
to
our
repast
which
was
excellent
it
was
composed
of
almost
everything
sometimes
i
found
myself
busy
with
the
wing
of
a
fowl
at
another
the
leg
of
a
rabbit
then
a
piece
of
mutton
or
other
flesh
and
fowl
which
i
could
hardly
distinguish
to
these
were
added
every
sort
of
vegetable
among
which
potatoes
predominated
forming
a
sort
of
stew
which
an
epicure
might
have
praised
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
melchior
in
the
evening
and
not
to
weary
the
reader
i
shall
now
proceed
to
state
all
that
i
then
and
subsequently
gathered
from
him
and
others
relative
to
the
parties
with
whom
we
were
associating
melchior
would
not
state
who
and
what
he
was
previous
to
his
having
joined
the
fraternity
of
gipsies
that
he
was
not
of
humble
birth
and
that
he
had
when
young
quitted
his
friends
out
of
love
for
nattee
or
from
some
other
causes
not
to
be
revealed
he
led
me
to
surmise
he
had
been
many
years
in
company
with
the
tribe
and
although
as
one
received
into
it
he
did
not
stand
so
high
in
rank
and
estimation
as
his
wife
still
from
his
marriage
with
nattee
and
his
own
peculiar
qualifications
and
dexterity
he
was
almost
as
absolute
as
she
was
melchior
and
nattee
were
supposed
to
be
the
most
wealthy
of
all
the
gipsies
and
at
the
same
time
they
were
the
most
liberal
of
their
wealth
melchior
it
appeared
gained
money
in
three
different
characters
as
a
quack
doctor
the
character
in
which
we
first
saw
him
secondly
as
a
juggler
in
which
art
he
was
most
expert
and
thirdly
as
a
and
nattee
as
i
before
mentioned
was
of
very
high
rank
or
caste
in
her
tribe
at
her
first
espousal
of
melchior
she
lost
much
of
her
influence
as
it
was
considered
a
degradation
but
she
was
then
very
young
and
must
have
been
most
beautiful
the
talents
of
melchior
and
her
own
spirit
however
soon
enabled
her
to
regain
and
even
add
still
more
to
her
power
and
consideration
among
the
tribe
and
it
was
incredible
to
what
extent
with
the
means
which
she
possessed
this
power
was
augmented
melchior
had
no
children
by
his
marriage
and
as
far
as
i
could
judge
from
the
few
words
which
would
escape
from
the
lips
of
nattee
she
did
not
wish
for
any
as
the
race
would
not
be
considered
pure
the
subdivision
of
the
tribe
which
followed
nattee
consisted
of
about
forty
men
women
and
children
these
were
ruled
by
her
during
the
absence
of
her
husband
who
alternately
assumed
different
characters
as
suited
his
purpose
but
in
whatever
town
melchior
might
happen
to
be
nattee
and
her
tribe
were
never
far
off
and
always
encamped
within
communication
i
ventured
to
question
melchior
about
the
little
fleta
and
he
stated
that
she
was
the
child
of
a
soldier
wife
who
had
been
brought
to
bed
and
died
a
few
hours
afterwards
that
at
the
time
she
was
on
her
way
to
join
her
husband
and
had
been
taken
ill
on
the
road
had
been
assisted
by
nattee
and
her
companions
as
far
as
they
were
able
had
been
buried
by
them
and
that
the
child
had
been
reared
in
the
camp
in
time
the
little
girl
became
very
intimate
and
very
partial
to
me
i
questioned
her
as
to
her
birth
telling
her
what
melchior
had
stated
for
a
long
while
she
would
not
answer
the
poor
child
had
learned
caution
even
at
that
early
age
but
after
we
were
more
intimate
she
said
that
which
melchior
had
stated
was
she
could
recollect
very
well
living
in
a
great
house
with
everything
very
fine
about
her
but
still
it
appeared
as
if
it
were
a
dream
she
recollected
two
white
ponies
and
a
lady
who
was
her
mamma
and
a
where
she
stained
her
frock
sometimes
other
things
came
to
her
memory
and
then
she
forgot
them
again
from
this
it
was
evident
that
she
had
been
stolen
and
was
probably
of
good
parentage
certainly
if
elegance
and
symmetry
of
person
and
form
could
prove
blood
it
never
was
more
marked
than
in
this
interesting
child
her
abode
with
the
gipsies
and
their
peculiar
mode
of
life
and
manners
had
rendered
her
astonishingly
precocious
in
intellect
but
of
education
she
had
none
except
what
was
instilled
into
her
by
melchior
whom
she
always
accompanied
when
he
assumed
his
character
as
a
juggler
she
then
danced
on
the
slack
wire
at
the
same
time
performing
several
feats
in
balancing
throwing
of
oranges
etcetera
when
melchior
was
under
other
disguises
she
remained
in
the
camp
with
nattee
of
num
or
philotas
as
melchior
thought
proper
to
call
him
i
have
already
spoken
he
was
a
idiot
picked
up
in
one
of
melchior
excursions
and
as
he
stated
to
me
so
did
it
prove
to
be
the
fact
that
when
on
the
stage
and
questioned
as
a
fool
his
natural
folly
and
idiotical
vacancy
of
countenance
were
applauded
by
the
spectators
as
admirably
assumed
even
at
the
alehouses
and
taverns
where
we
stopped
everyone
imagined
that
all
his
folly
was
pretence
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
very
clever
fellow
there
never
was
perhaps
such
a
lachrymose
countenance
as
this
poor
lad
and
this
added
still
more
to
the
mirth
of
others
being
also
considered
as
put
on
for
the
occasion
stephen
kemble
played
falstaff
without
stuffing
num
played
the
fool
without
any
effort
or
preparation
jumbo
was
also
picked
up
this
was
not
done
by
melchior
who
stated
that
anybody
might
have
him
who
claimed
him
he
tumbled
with
the
fool
upon
the
stage
and
he
also
ate
pudding
to
amuse
the
spectators
the
only
part
of
the
performance
which
was
suited
to
jumbo
taste
for
he
was
a
terrible
little
glutton
and
never
lost
any
opportunity
of
eating
as
well
as
of
sleeping
and
now
having
described
all
our
new
companions
i
must
narrate
what
passed
between
melchior
and
me
the
day
after
our
joining
the
camp
he
first
ran
through
his
various
professions
pointing
out
to
me
that
as
juggler
he
required
a
confederate
in
which
capacity
i
might
be
very
useful
as
he
would
soon
instruct
me
in
all
his
tricks
as
a
quack
doctor
he
wanted
the
services
of
both
tim
and
myself
in
mixing
up
making
pills
etcetera
and
also
in
assisting
him
in
persuading
the
public
of
his
great
skill
as
a
i
should
also
be
of
great
service
as
he
would
explain
to
me
hereafter
in
short
he
wanted
a
person
of
good
personal
appearance
and
education
in
whom
he
might
confide
in
every
way
as
to
tim
he
might
be
made
useful
if
he
chose
in
various
ways
amongst
others
he
wished
him
to
learn
tumbling
and
playing
the
fool
when
at
times
the
fool
was
required
to
give
a
shrewd
answer
on
any
point
on
which
he
would
wish
the
public
to
be
made
acquainted
i
agreed
to
my
own
part
of
the
performance
and
then
had
some
conversation
with
timothy
who
immediately
consented
to
do
his
best
in
what
was
allotted
as
his
share
thus
was
the
matter
quickly
arranged
melchior
observing
that
he
had
said
nothing
about
remuneration
as
i
should
find
that
trusting
to
him
was
far
preferable
to
stipulated
wages
part
one
chapter
eleven
whatever
may
be
the
opinion
of
the
reader
he
can
not
assert
that
we
are
no
conjurors
we
suit
our
wares
to
our
customers
and
our
profits
are
considerable
we
had
been
three
days
in
the
camp
when
the
gathering
was
broken
up
each
gang
taking
their
own
way
what
the
meeting
was
about
i
could
not
exactly
discover
one
occasion
of
it
was
to
make
arrangements
relative
to
the
different
counties
in
which
the
subdivisions
were
to
sojourn
during
the
next
year
so
that
they
might
know
where
to
communicate
with
each
other
and
at
the
same
time
not
interfere
by
being
too
near
but
there
were
many
other
points
discussed
of
which
as
a
stranger
i
was
kept
in
ignorance
melchior
answered
all
my
questions
with
apparent
candour
but
his
habitual
deceit
was
such
that
whether
he
told
the
truth
or
not
was
impossible
to
be
ascertained
by
his
countenance
when
the
gathering
dispersed
we
packed
up
and
located
ourselves
about
two
miles
from
the
common
on
the
borders
of
a
forest
of
oak
and
ash
our
food
was
chiefly
game
for
we
had
some
excellent
poachers
among
us
and
as
for
fish
it
appeared
to
be
at
their
command
there
was
not
a
pond
or
a
pit
but
they
could
tell
in
a
moment
if
it
were
tenanted
and
if
tenanted
in
half
an
hour
every
fish
would
be
floating
on
the
top
of
the
water
by
the
throwing
in
of
some
intoxicating
sort
of
berry
other
articles
of
food
occasionally
were
found
in
the
caldron
indeed
it
was
impossible
to
fare
better
than
we
did
or
at
less
expense
our
tents
were
generally
pitched
not
far
from
a
pool
of
water
and
to
avoid
any
unpleasant
search
which
sometimes
would
take
place
everything
liable
to
detection
was
sunk
under
the
water
until
it
was
required
for
cooking
once
in
the
pot
it
was
considered
as
safe
but
with
the
foraging
timothy
and
i
had
nothing
to
do
we
participated
in
the
eating
without
asking
any
questions
as
to
how
it
was
procured
my
time
was
chiefly
spent
in
company
with
melchior
who
initiated
me
into
all
the
mysteries
of
cups
and
balls
juggling
of
every
description
feats
with
cards
and
made
me
acquainted
with
all
his
apparatus
for
prepared
tricks
for
hours
and
hours
was
i
employed
by
his
directions
in
what
is
called
making
the
pass
with
a
pack
of
cards
as
almost
all
tricks
on
cards
depend
upon
your
dexterity
in
this
manoeuvre
in
about
a
month
i
was
considered
as
a
very
fair
adept
in
the
mean
time
timothy
had
to
undergo
his
career
of
gymnastics
and
was
to
be
seen
all
day
tumbling
and
until
he
could
tumble
on
his
feet
again
light
and
active
he
soon
became
a
very
dexterous
performer
and
could
throw
a
somerset
either
backwards
or
forwards
walk
on
his
hands
eat
fire
pull
out
ribands
and
do
fifty
other
tricks
to
amuse
a
gaping
audience
jumbo
also
was
worked
hard
to
bring
down
his
fat
and
never
was
allowed
his
dinner
until
he
had
given
satisfaction
to
melchior
even
little
fleta
had
to
practise
occasionally
as
we
were
preparing
for
an
expedition
melchior
who
appeared
determined
to
create
an
effect
left
us
for
three
days
and
returned
with
not
only
dresses
for
timothy
and
me
but
also
new
dresses
for
the
rest
of
the
company
and
shortly
afterwards
bidding
farewell
to
nattee
and
the
rest
of
the
gipsies
we
all
set
out
that
is
melchior
i
timothy
fleta
num
and
jumbo
late
in
the
evening
we
arrived
at
the
little
town
of
and
took
up
our
quarters
at
a
with
the
landlord
of
which
melchior
had
already
made
arrangements
well
timothy
said
i
as
soon
as
we
were
in
bed
how
do
you
like
our
new
life
and
prospects
i
like
it
better
than
mr
cophagus
and
carrying
out
physic
at
all
events
but
how
does
your
dignity
like
turning
merry
andrew
japhet
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
dislike
it
there
is
a
wildness
and
a
feeling
connected
with
it
which
is
grateful
to
me
at
present
how
long
it
may
last
i
can
not
tell
but
for
a
year
or
two
it
appears
to
me
that
we
may
be
very
happy
at
all
events
we
shall
see
the
world
and
have
more
than
one
profession
to
fall
back
upon
that
is
true
but
there
is
one
thing
that
annoys
me
japhet
which
is
we
may
have
difficulty
in
leaving
these
people
when
we
wish
besides
you
forget
that
you
are
losing
sight
of
the
principal
object
you
had
in
view
that
is
of
finding
out
your
father
i
certainly
never
expect
to
find
him
among
the
gipsies
replied
i
for
children
are
at
a
premium
with
them
they
steal
from
others
and
are
not
very
likely
therefore
to
leave
them
at
the
foundling
but
i
do
not
know
whether
i
have
not
as
good
a
chance
in
our
present
employment
as
in
any
other
i
have
often
been
thinking
that
as
we
may
get
hold
of
many
strange
secrets
however
we
shall
see
melchior
says
that
he
intends
to
appear
in
that
character
as
soon
as
he
has
made
a
harvest
in
his
present
one
what
do
you
think
of
melchior
now
that
you
have
been
so
much
with
him
i
think
him
an
unprincipled
man
but
still
with
many
good
qualities
he
appears
to
have
a
pleasure
in
deceit
and
to
have
waged
war
with
the
world
in
general
still
he
is
generous
and
to
a
certain
degree
confiding
kind
in
his
disposition
and
apparently
a
very
good
husband
there
is
something
on
his
mind
which
weighs
him
down
occasionally
and
checks
him
in
the
height
of
his
mirth
it
comes
over
him
like
a
dark
cloud
over
a
bright
summer
sun
and
he
is
all
gloom
for
a
few
minutes
i
do
not
think
that
he
would
commit
any
great
crime
but
i
have
a
suspicion
that
he
has
done
something
which
is
a
constant
cause
of
remorse
you
are
a
very
good
judge
of
character
japhet
but
what
a
dear
little
child
is
that
fleta
she
may
exclaim
with
you
who
is
my
father
yes
we
are
both
in
much
the
same
predicament
and
that
it
is
which
i
believe
has
so
much
increased
my
attachment
to
her
we
are
brother
and
sister
in
misfortune
and
a
sister
she
ever
shall
be
to
me
if
such
is
the
will
of
heaven
but
we
must
rise
early
tim
so
good
night
yes
it
will
be
juggle
and
tumble
eat
fire
um
and
so
on
as
mr
cophagus
would
have
said
so
good
night
japhet
the
next
morning
we
arrayed
ourselves
in
our
new
habiliments
mine
were
silk
stockings
shoes
and
white
kerseymere
knee
breeches
a
blue
silk
waistcoat
loaded
with
tinsel
and
a
short
jacket
to
correspond
of
blue
velvet
a
sash
round
my
waist
a
hat
and
a
plume
of
feathers
timothy
declared
i
looked
very
handsome
and
as
the
glass
said
the
same
as
plain
as
it
could
speak
i
believed
him
timothy
dress
was
a
pair
of
wide
turkish
trowsers
and
red
jacket
with
spangles
the
others
were
much
the
same
fleta
was
attired
in
small
white
satin
turkish
trowsers
blue
muslin
and
silver
embroidered
frock
worked
sandals
and
her
hair
braided
and
plaited
in
long
tails
behind
and
she
looked
like
a
little
sylph
melchior
dress
was
precisely
the
same
as
mine
and
a
more
respectable
company
was
seldom
seen
some
musicians
had
been
hired
and
handbills
were
now
circulated
all
over
the
town
stating
that
signor
eugenio
velotti
with
his
company
would
have
the
honour
of
performing
before
the
nobility
and
gentry
the
bill
contained
the
fare
which
was
to
be
provided
and
intimated
the
hour
of
the
performance
and
the
prices
to
be
paid
for
the
seats
the
performance
was
to
take
place
in
a
very
large
room
attached
to
the
inn
which
previous
to
the
decadence
of
the
town
had
been
used
as
an
a
platform
was
erected
on
the
outside
on
which
were
placed
the
musicians
and
where
we
all
occasionally
made
our
appearance
in
our
splendid
dresses
to
attract
the
wonder
of
the
people
there
we
strutted
up
and
down
all
but
poor
little
fleta
who
appeared
to
shrink
at
the
display
from
intuitive
modesty
when
the
music
ceased
a
smart
parley
between
melchior
and
me
and
philotas
and
timothy
as
the
two
fools
would
take
place
and
melchior
declared
after
the
performance
was
over
that
we
conducted
ourselves
to
admiration
pray
mr
philotas
do
me
the
favour
to
tell
me
how
many
people
you
think
are
now
present
said
melchior
to
num
in
an
imperative
voice
i
do
know
said
num
looking
up
with
his
idiotical
melancholy
face
ha
ha
ha
roared
the
crowd
at
num

said
melchior
to
the
gaping
audience

continued
melchior
to
philotas

honour
us
with
their
company

many

many
i

said
num
after
a
pause
positively
you
are
the
greatest
fool
i
ever
met
with
said
melchior
well
he
does
act
the
fool
as
natural
as
life
observed
the
crowd
what
a
stupid
face
he
does
put
on
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
answer
that
question
mr
dionysius
said
i
to
tim
yes
sir
i
know
exactly
well
sir
let
hear
in
the
first
place
all
the
pretty
women

and
all
the
ugly
ones
stay
away
and
as
for
the
men
all
those
who
have
got
any
money
will
be
certain
to
come
those
who
poor
devils
must
stay
outside
suppose
sir
you
make
a
bow
to
the
ladies
a
very
low
one
sir
yes
very
low
indeed
tim
bent
his
body
to
the
ground
and
threw
a
somerset
forward
there
sir
i
bowed
so
low
that
i
came
up
on
the
other
side
ha
ha
capital
from
the
crowd
i
got
a
round
turn
in
my
back
sir
continued
tim
rubbing
himself
had
i
better
take
it
out
again
by
all
means
tim
threw
a
somerset
backwards
there
sir
all
right
now
one
good
turn
deserves
another
now
i
be
off
where
are
you
going
to
sir
going
sir
why
i
left
my
lollipop
in
the
and
i
going
to
fetch
it
ha
ha
ha
strike
up
music
and
master
jumbo
commenced
tumbling
such
was
the
elegant
wit
with
which
we
amused
and
attracted
the
audience
perhaps
had
we
been
more
refined
we
should
not
have
been
so
successful
that
evening
we
had
the
room
as
full
as
it
could
hold
signor
velotti
melchior
astonished
them
the
cards
appeared
to
obey
his
commands
rings
were
discovered
in
lady
shoes
watches
were
beat
to
a
powder
and
made
whole
canary
birds
flew
out
of
eggs
the
audience
were
delighted
the
entertainment
closed
with
fleta
performance
on
the
slack
wire
and
certainly
never
was
there
anything
more
beautiful
and
graceful
balanced
on
the
wire
in
a
continual
waving
motion
her
eyes
fixed
upon
a
point
to
enable
her
to
maintain
her
position
she
performed
several
feats
such
as
the
playing
with
five
oranges
balancing
swords
etcetera
her
extreme
beauty
her
very
picturesque
and
becoming
dress
her
mournful
expression
and
downcast
eyes
her
gentle
manner
appeared
to
win
the
hearts
of
the
audience
and
when
she
was
assisted
off
from
her
perilous
situation
by
melchior
and
me
and
made
her
graceful
courtesy
the
plaudits
were
unanimous
when
the
company
dispersed
i
went
to
her
intending
to
praise
her
but
i
found
her
in
tears
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
fleta
o
nothing
do
say
i
have
been
crying
but
i
can
not
bear
it
so
many
people
looking
at
me
do
say
a
word
to
melchior
i
wo
cry
any
more
part
one
chapter
twelve
it
is
very
easy
to
humbug
those
who
are
so
eager
to
be
humbugged
as
people
are
in
this
world
of
humbug
we
show
ourselves
excessively
disinterested
which
astonishes
everybody
i
kissed
and
consoled
her
she
threw
her
arm
round
my
neck
and
remained
there
with
her
face
hid
for
some
time
we
then
joined
the
others
at
supper
melchior
was
much
pleased
with
our
success
and
highly
praised
the
conduct
of
timothy
and
myself
which
he
pronounced
was
for
the
first
attempt
far
beyond
his
expectations
we
continued
to
astonish
all
the
good
people
of
for
five
days
when
we
discovered
the
indubitable
fact
that
there
was
no
more
money
to
be
extracted
from
their
pockets
upon
which
we
resumed
our
usual
clothes
and
and
with
our
bundles
in
our
hands
set
off
for
another
market
town
about
fifteen
miles
distant
there
we
were
equally
successful
and
melchior
was
delighted
with
our
having
proved
such
a
powerful
acquisition
to
his
troop
but
not
to
dwell
too
long
upon
one
subject
i
shall
inform
the
reader
that
after
a
trip
of
six
weeks
during
which
we
were
very
well
received
we
once
more
returned
to
the
camp
which
had
located
within
five
miles
of
our
last
scene
of
action
everyone
was
content
we
were
all
glad
to
get
back
and
rest
from
our
labours
melchior
was
pleased
with
his
profits
poor
little
fleta
overjoyed
to
be
once
more
in
the
seclusion
of
her
tent
and
nattee
very
glad
to
hear
of
our
good
fortune
and
to
see
her
husband
timothy
and
i
had
already
proved
ourselves
so
useful
that
melchior
treated
us
with
the
greatest
friendship
and
confidence
and
he
made
us
a
present
out
of
the
gains
for
our
exertions
to
me
he
gave
ten
and
to
timothy
five
pounds
there
japhet
had
you
hired
yourself
i
should
not
have
paid
you
more
than
seven
shillings
per
week
finding
you
in
food
but
you
must
acknowledge
that
for
six
weeks
that
is
not
bad
pay
however
your
earnings
will
depend
upon
our
success
and
i
rather
think
that
we
shall
make
a
much
better
thing
of
it
when
next
we
start
which
will
be
in
about
a
fortnight
but
we
have
some
arrangements
to
make
has
timothy
a
good
memory
i
think
he
has
that
is
well
i
told
you
before
that
we
are
to
try
the
man
but
first
we
must
have
nattee
in
play
we
will
start
for
mentioning
a
small
quiet
town
about
four
miles
off
we
did
so
early
the
next
morning
and
arrived
about
noon
pitching
our
tents
on
the
common
not
far
from
the
town
but
in
this
instance
we
left
all
the
rest
of
our
gang
behind
melchior
own
party
and
his
two
tents
were
all
that
were
brought
by
the
donkeys
melchior
and
i
dressed
as
countrymen
went
into
the
town
at
dusk
and
entered
a
respectable
sort
of
inn
taking
our
seats
at
one
of
the
tables
in
the
and
as
we
had
already
planned
after
we
had
called
for
beer
commenced
a
conversation
in
the
hearing
of
the
others
who
were
sitting
drinking
and
smoking
well
i
never
will
believe
it
it
all
cheat
and
trickery
said
melchior
and
they
only
do
it
to
pick
your
pocket
tell
your
fortune
indeed
i
suppose
she
promised
you
a
rich
wife
and
children
no
she
did
not
replied
i
for
i
am
too
young
to
marry
but
she
told
me
what
i
know
has
happened
well
what
was
that
why
she
told
me
that
my
mother
had
married
again
and
turned
me
out
of
doors
to
work
for
my
bread
but
she
might
have
heard
that
how
could
she
no
that
not
possible
but
she
told
me
i
had
a
mole
on
my
knee
which
was
a
sign
of
luck
now
how
could
she
know
that
well
i
grant
that
was
odd
and
pray
what
else
did
she
promise
you
why
she
said
that
i
should
meet
with
my
dearest
friend
now
that
does
puzzle
me
for
i
have
but
one
in
the
world
and
he
is
a
long
way
off
well
if
you
do
meet
your
friend
then
i
believe
her
but
if
not
it
has
been
all
guess
work
and
pray
what
did
you
pay
for
all
this
was
it
a
shilling
or
did
she
pick
your
pocket
that
what
puzzles
me
she
refused
to
take
anything
i
offered
it
again
and
again
and
she
said
that
she
would
have
no
money
that
her
gift
was
not
to
be
sold
well
that
is
odd
do
you
hear
what
this
young
man
says
said
melchior
addressing
the
others
who
had
swallowed
every
word
yes
replied
one
but
who
is
this
person
the
queen
of
the
gipsies
i
am
told
i
never
saw
such
a
wonderful
woman
in
my
life
her
eye
goes
right
through
you
i
met
her
on
the
common
and
as
she
passed
she
dropped
a
handkerchief
i
ran
back
to
give
it
her
and
then
she
thanked
me
and
said
your
hand
and
let
me
see
the
palm
here
are
great
lines
and
you
will
be
fortunate
and
then
she
told
me
a
great
deal
more
and
bid
god
bless
me
then
if
she
said
that
she
can
not
have
dealings
with
the
observed
melchior
very
odd
very
strange
take
no
money
queen
of
the
gipsies
was
echoed
from
all
sides
the
landlady
and
the
listened
with
wonder
when
who
should
come
in
as
previously
agreed
but
timothy
i
pretended
not
to
see
him
but
he
came
up
to
me
seizing
me
by
the
hand
and
shaking
it
with
apparent
delight
and
crying
wilson
have
you
forgot
smith
smith
cried
i
looking
earnestly
in
his
face
why
so
it
is
how
came
you
here
i
left
dublin
three
days
ago
replied
he
but
how
i
came
here
into
this
house
is
one
of
the
strangest
things
that
ever
occurred
i
was
walking
over
the
common
when
a
tall
handsome
woman
looked
at
me
and
said
man
if
you
will
go
into
the
third
you
pass
you
will
meet
an
old
friend
who
expects
you
i
thought
she
was
laughing
at
me
but
as
it
mattered
very
little
in
which
house
i
passed
the
night
i
thought
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
i
might
as
well
take
her
advice
how
strange
cried
melchior
and
she
told
him
the
same
that
is
he
would
meet
a
friend
strange
very
strange
wonderful
astonishing
was
echoed
from
all
quarters
and
the
fame
of
the
gipsy
was
already
established
timothy
and
i
sat
down
together
conversing
as
old
friends
and
melchior
went
about
from
one
to
the
other
narrating
the
wonderful
occurrence
till
past
midnight
when
we
all
three
took
beds
at
the
inn
as
if
we
were
travellers
the
report
which
we
had
circulated
that
evening
induced
many
people
to
go
out
to
see
nattee
who
appeared
to
take
no
notice
of
them
and
when
asked
to
tell
fortunes
waved
them
away
with
her
hand
but
although
this
plan
of
melchior
was
for
the
first
two
or
three
days
very
expedient
yet
as
it
was
not
intended
to
last
timothy
who
remained
with
me
at
the
inn
became
very
intimate
with
the
and
obtained
from
her
most
of
the
particulars
of
her
life
i
also
from
repeated
conversations
with
the
landlady
received
information
very
important
relative
to
herself
and
many
of
the
families
in
the
town
but
as
the
employment
of
nattee
was
for
an
ulterior
object
we
contented
ourselves
with
gaining
all
the
information
we
could
before
we
proceeded
further
after
we
had
been
there
a
week
and
the
fame
of
the
gipsy
woman
had
been
marvellously
increased
many
things
having
been
asserted
of
her
which
were
indeed
truly
improbable
melchior
agreed
that
timothy
should
persuade
the
to
try
if
the
gipsy
woman
would
tell
her
fortune
the
girl
with
some
trepidation
agreed
but
at
the
same
time
expecting
to
be
refused
consented
to
walk
with
him
over
the
common
timothy
advised
her
to
pretend
to
pick
up
a
sixpence
when
near
to
nattee
and
ask
her
if
it
did
not
belong
to
her
and
the
acted
upon
his
suggestions
having
just
before
that
quitted
the
arm
of
timothy
who
had
conducted
her
did
you
drop
a
sixpence
i
have
picked
up
one
said
the
girl
trembling
with
fear
as
she
addressed
nattee
child
replied
nattee
who
was
prepared
i
have
neither
dropped
a
sixpence
nor
have
you
found
one
but
never
mind
that
i
know
that
which
you
wish
and
i
know
who
you
are
now
what
would
you
with
me
is
it
to
inquire
whether
the
landlord
and
landlady
of
the
golden
lion
intend
to
keep
you
in
their
service
no
replied
this
girl
frightened
at
what
she
heard
not
to
inquire
that
but
to
ask
what
my
fortune
will
be
open
your
palm
pretty
maid
and
i
will
tell
you
hah
i
see
that
you
were
born
in
the
west
your
father
is
dead
your
mother
is
in
service
and
let
me
see
you
have
a
brother
at
sea
now
in
the
west
indies
at
this
intelligence
all
of
which
as
may
be
supposed
had
been
gathered
by
us
the
poor
girl
was
so
frightened
that
she
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
timothy
carried
her
off
when
she
was
taken
home
to
the
inn
she
was
so
ill
that
she
was
put
into
bed
and
what
she
did
say
was
so
incoherent
that
added
to
timothy
narrative
the
astonishment
of
the
landlady
and
others
was
beyond
all
bounds
i
tried
very
hard
to
bring
the
landlady
but
she
would
not
consent
and
now
nattee
was
pestered
by
people
of
higher
condition
who
wished
to
hear
what
she
would
say
here
nattee
power
were
brought
into
play
she
would
not
refuse
to
see
them
but
would
not
give
answers
till
she
had
asked
question
and
as
from
us
she
had
gleaned
much
general
information
so
by
making
this
knowledge
appear
in
her
questions
to
them
she
made
them
believe
she
knew
more
if
a
young
person
came
to
her
she
would
immediately
ask
the
name
of
that
name
she
had
all
the
references
acquired
from
us
as
to
family
and
connexions
bearing
upon
them
she
would
ask
a
few
more
and
then
give
them
an
abrupt
dismissal
this
behaviour
was
put
up
with
from
one
of
her
commanding
presence
who
refused
money
and
treated
those
who
accosted
her
as
if
she
was
their
superior
many
came
again
and
again
telling
her
all
they
knew
and
acquainting
her
with
every
transaction
of
their
life
to
induce
her
to
prophesy
for
such
she
informed
them
was
the
surest
way
to
call
the
spirit
upon
her
by
these
means
we
obtained
the
secret
history
of
the
major
part
that
is
the
wealthier
part
of
the
town
of
and
although
the
predictions
of
nattee
were
seldom
given
yet
when
given
they
were
given
with
such
perfect
and
apparent
knowledge
of
the
parties
that
when
she
left
which
she
did
about
six
weeks
after
her
first
appearance
the
whole
town
rang
with
accounts
of
her
wonderful
powers
it
will
appear
strange
that
melchior
would
not
permit
nattee
to
reap
a
harvest
which
might
have
been
great
but
the
fact
was
that
he
only
allowed
the
seed
to
be
sown
that
a
greater
harvest
might
be
gathered
hereafter
nattee
disappeared
the
gipsies
tent
was
no
longer
on
the
common
and
the
grass
which
had
been
beaten
down
into
a
road
by
the
feet
of
the
frequent
applicants
to
her
was
again
permitted
to
spring
up
we
also
took
our
departure
and
rejoined
the
camp
with
nattee
where
we
remained
for
a
fortnight
to
permit
the
remembrance
of
her
to
subside
a
little
knowing
that
the
appetite
was
alive
and
would
not
be
satisfied
until
it
was
appeased
after
that
time
melchior
timothy
and
i
again
set
off
for
the
town
of
and
stopping
at
a
superior
inn
in
another
part
of
the
town
dressed
as
travellers
that
is
people
who
go
about
the
country
for
orders
from
the
manufacturers
ordered
our
beds
and
supper
in
the
the
conversation
was
soon
turned
upon
the
wonderful
powers
of
nattee
the
gipsy
nonsense
said
melchior
she
knows
nothing
i
have
heard
of
her
but
there
a
man
coming
this
way
should
he
happen
to
pass
through
this
town
who
will
surprise
and
frighten
you
no
one
knows
who
he
is
he
is
named
the
great
aristodemus
he
knows
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
he
never
looks
at
people
hands
he
only
looks
you
in
the
face
and
be
to
them
who
tell
him
a
otherwise
he
is
and
obliging
and
will
tell
what
will
come
to
pass
and
his
predictions
never
have
been
known
to
fail
they
say
that
he
is
hundreds
of
years
old
and
his
hair
is
while
as
silver
at
this
information
many
expressed
their
doubts
and
many
others
vaunted
the
powers
of
the
gipsy
melchior
replied
that
all
he
knew
was
that
for
the
sum
of
two
guineas
paid
down
he
had
told
him
of
a
legacy
left
him
of
six
hundred
pounds
which
otherwise
he
would
never
have
known
of
or
received
all
the
town
of
being
quite
alive
for
this
new
report
gained
wind
and
after
a
week
sojourn
melchior
thought
that
the
attempt
should
be
made
part
one
chapter
thirteen
the
seed
having
been
carefully
sown
we
now
reap
a
golden
harvest
we
tell
everyone
what
they
knew
before
and
we
are
looked
upon
as
most
marvellous
by
most
marvellous
fools
we
accordingly
packed
up
and
departed
to
another
market
town
timothy
dressed
in
a
sombre
suit
of
black
very
much
like
an
undertaker
was
provided
with
a
horse
with
the
following
directions
to
proceed
leisurely
until
he
was
within
half
a
mile
of
the
town
of
and
then
to
gallop
in
as
fast
as
he
could
stop
at
the
best
inn
in
the
place
and
order
apartments
for
the
great
aristodemus
who
might
be
expected
in
half
an
hour
everything
in
this
world
depends
upon
appearances
that
is
when
you
intend
to
gull
it
and
as
everyone
in
the
town
had
heard
of
the
great
aristodemus
so
everyone
was
anxious
to
know
something
about
him
and
timothy
was
pestered
with
all
manner
of
questions
but
he
declared
that
he
was
only
his
courier
and
could
only
tell
what
other
people
said
but
then
what
other
people
said
by
timothy
account
was
very
marvellous
indeed
timothy
had
hardly
time
to
secure
the
best
rooms
in
the
hotel
when
melchior
dressed
in
a
long
flowing
silk
gown
with
a
wig
of
long
white
hair
a
square
cap
and
two
or
three
gold
chains
hanging
from
his
neck
certainly
most
admirably
disguised
and
attended
by
me
in
the
dress
of
a
german
student
a
wig
of
long
brown
locks
hanging
down
my
shoulders
made
our
appearance
in
a
and
four
and
drove
up
to
the
door
of
the
inn
at
a
pace
which
shook
every
house
in
the
street
and
occasioned
every
window
to
be
tenanted
with
one
or
more
heads
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
this
unusual
occurrence
for
it
was
not
a
very
great
town
although
once
of
importance
but
the
manufactures
had
been
removed
and
it
was
occupied
by
those
who
had
become
independent
by
their
own
exertions
or
by
those
of
their
forefathers
the
door
of
the
chaise
was
opened
by
the
obsequious
timothy
who
pushed
away
the
ostlers
and
waiters
as
if
unworthy
to
approach
his
master
and
the
great
aristodemus
made
his
appearance
as
he
ascended
the
steps
of
the
door
his
passage
was
for
a
moment
barred
by
one
whose
profession
melchior
well
knew
stand
aside
exciseman
said
he
in
a
commanding
voice
no
one
crosses
my
path
with
impunity
astonished
at
hearing
his
profession
thus
mentioned
the
exciseman
who
was
the
greatest
bully
in
the
town
slipped
on
one
side
with
consternation
and
all
those
present
lifted
up
their
eyes
and
hands
with
astonishment
the
great
aristodemus
gained
his
room
and
shut
his
door
and
i
went
out
to
pay
for
the
chaise
and
order
supper
while
timothy
and
the
porters
were
busy
with
our
luggage
which
was
very
considerable
my
master
will
not
see
anyone
said
i
to
the
landlord
he
quits
this
town
if
the
letters
arrive
which
he
expects
by
the
post
therefore
pray
get
rid
of
this
crowd
and
let
him
be
quiet
for
he
is
very
tired
having
travelled
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
since
the
dawn
of
day
when
tim
and
i
had
performed
this
duty
we
joined
melchior
in
his
room
leaving
the
news
to
be
circulated
this
promises
well
observed
melchior
up
to
the
present
we
have
expended
much
time
and
money
now
we
must
see
if
we
can
not
recover
it
tenfold
japhet
you
must
take
an
opportunity
of
going
out
again
after
supper
and
make
inquiries
of
the
landlord
what
poor
people
they
have
in
the
town
as
i
am
very
generous
and
like
to
relieve
them
you
may
observe
that
all
the
money
offered
to
me
for
practising
my
art
i
give
away
to
the
poor
having
no
occasion
for
it
this
i
did
and
we
then
sat
down
to
supper
and
having
unpacked
our
baggage
went
to
bed
after
locking
the
door
of
the
room
and
taking
out
the
key
the
next
morning
we
had
everything
in
readiness
and
as
the
letters
as
the
reader
may
suppose
did
not
arrive
by
the
post
we
were
obliged
to
remain
and
the
landlord
ventured
to
hint
to
me
that
several
people
were
anxious
to
consult
my
master
i
replied
that
i
would
speak
to
him
but
it
was
necessary
to
caution
those
who
came
that
they
must
either
offer
gold
or
nothing
at
all
i
brought
his
consent
to
see
one
or
two
but
no
more
now
although
we
had
various
apparatus
to
use
when
required
it
was
thought
that
the
effect
would
be
greater
if
in
the
first
instance
everything
was
simple
melchior
therefore
remained
sitting
at
the
table
which
was
covered
with
a
black
cloth
worked
with
curious
devices
and
a
book
of
hieroglyphics
before
him
and
an
ivory
wand
tipped
with
gold
lying
by
the
book
timothy
standing
at
the
door
with
a
short
roman
sword
buckled
round
his
belt
and
i
in
a
respectful
attitude
behind
the
great
aristodemus
the
first
person
who
was
admitted
was
the
lady
of
the
mayor
of
the
town
nothing
could
be
more
fortunate
as
we
had
every
information
relative
to
her
and
her
spouse
for
people
in
high
places
are
always
talked
of
aristodemus
waved
his
hand
and
i
brought
forward
a
chair
in
silence
and
motioned
that
she
should
be
seated
aristodemus
looked
her
in
her
face
and
then
turned
over
several
leaves
until
he
fixed
upon
a
page
which
he
considered
attentively
mayoress
of
what
wouldst
thou
with
me
she
started
and
turned
pale
i
would
ask
i
know
thou
wouldst
ask
many
things
perhaps
had
i
time
to
listen
amongst
others
thou
wouldst
ask
if
there
is
any
chance
of
thy
giving
an
heir
to
thy
husband
is
it
not
so
yes
it
is
replied
the
lady
fetching
her
breath
so
do
i
perceive
by
this
book
but
let
me
put
one
question
to
thee
wouldst
thou
have
blessings
showered
on
thee
yet
do
no
good
thou
art
wealthy
yet
what
dost
thou
and
thy
husband
do
with
these
riches
are
ye
liberal
no
give
and
it
shall
be
given
i
have
said
aristodemus
waved
his
hand
and
the
lady
rose
to
withdraw
a
guinea
was
in
her
fingers
and
her
purse
in
her
hand
she
took
out
four
more
and
added
them
to
the
other
and
laid
them
on
the
table
is
well
lady
charity
shall
plead
for
thee
artolphe
let
that
money
be
distributed
among
the
poor
i
bowed
in
silence
and
the
lady
retired
who
will
say
that
i
do
no
good
observed
melchior
smiling
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
her
avarice
and
that
of
her
husband
are
as
notorious
as
their
anxiety
for
children
now
if
i
persuade
them
to
be
liberal
i
do
service
but
you
have
given
her
hopes
i
have
and
the
very
hope
will
do
more
to
further
their
wishes
than
anything
else
it
is
despair
which
too
often
prevents
those
who
have
no
children
from
having
any
how
often
do
you
see
a
couple
who
after
years
waiting
for
children
have
at
last
given
up
their
hope
and
resigned
themselves
to
the
dispensations
of
providence
and
then
when
their
anxiety
has
subsided
have
obtained
a
family
japhet
i
am
a
shrewd
observer
of
human
nature
that
i
believe
replied
i
but
i
do
not
believe
your
last
remark
to
be
correct
but
timothy
raps
at
the
door
another
lady
entered
the
room
and
then
started
back
as
if
she
would
retreat
so
surprised
was
she
at
the
appearance
of
the
great
aristodemus
but
as
timothy
had
turned
the
key
her
escape
was
impossible
she
was
unknown
to
us
which
was
rather
awkward
but
melchior
raised
his
eyes
from
his
book
and
waved
his
hand
as
before
that
she
should
be
seated
with
some
trepidation
she
stated
that
she
was
a
widow
whose
dependence
was
upon
an
only
son
now
at
sea
that
she
had
not
heard
of
him
for
a
long
while
and
was
afraid
that
some
accident
had
happened
that
she
was
in
the
greatest
distress
and
continued
she
i
have
nothing
to
offer
but
this
ring
can
you
tell
me
if
he
is
yet
alive
cried
she
bursting
into
tears
but
if
you
have
not
the
art
you
pretend
to
o
do
not
rob
a
poor
friendless
creature
but
let
me
depart
when
did
you
receive
your
last
letter
from
him
said
melchior
it
is
now
seven
months
dated
from
bahia
replied
she
pulling
it
out
of
her
reticule
and
covering
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
melchior
caught
the
address
and
then
turned
the
letter
over
on
the
other
side
as
it
lay
on
the
table
mrs
watson
said
he
heavens
do
you
know
my
name
cried
the
woman
mrs
watson
i
do
not
require
to
read
your
son
letter
i
know
its
contents
he
then
turned
over
his
book
and
studied
for
a
few
seconds
your
son
is
alive
thank
god
cried
she
clasping
her
hands
and
dropping
her
reticule
but
you
must
not
expect
his
return
too
soon
he
is
well
employed
oh
i
care
not
he
is
alive
he
is
alive
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
melchior
made
a
sign
to
me
pointing
to
the
five
guineas
and
the
reticule
and
i
contrived
to
slip
them
into
her
reticule
while
she
sobbed
in
her
handkerchief
enough
madam
you
must
go
for
others
require
my
aid
the
poor
woman
rose
and
offered
the
ring
nay
nay
i
want
not
thy
money
i
take
from
the
rich
that
i
may
distribute
to
the
poor
but
not
from
the
widow
in
affliction
open
thy
bag
the
widow
took
up
her
bag
and
opened
it
melchior
dropped
in
the
ring
taking
his
wand
from
the
table
waved
it
and
touched
the
bag
as
thou
art
honest
so
may
thy
present
wants
be
relieved
seek
and
thou
shalt
find
the
widow
left
the
room
with
tears
of
gratitude
and
i
must
say
that
i
was
affected
with
the
same
when
she
had
gone
i
observed
to
melchior
that
up
to
the
present
he
had
toiled
for
nothing
very
true
japhet
but
depend
upon
it
if
i
assisted
that
poor
woman
from
no
other
feelings
than
interested
motives
i
did
well
but
i
tell
thee
candidly
i
did
it
from
compassion
we
are
odd
mixtures
of
good
and
evil
i
wage
war
with
fools
and
knaves
but
not
with
all
the
world
i
gave
that
money
freely
she
required
it
and
it
may
be
put
as
a
against
my
usual
system
of
fraud
or
it
may
not
at
all
events
i
pleased
myself
but
you
told
her
that
her
son
was
alive
very
true
and
he
may
be
dead
but
is
it
not
well
to
comfort
her
even
for
a
short
time
to
relieve
that
suspense
which
is
worse
than
the
actual
knowledge
of
his
death
sufficient
for
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
it
would
almost
have
appeared
that
this
good
action
of
melchior
met
with
its
reward
for
the
astonishment
of
the
widow
at
finding
the
gold
in
her
reticule
her
narrative
of
what
passed
and
her
assertion
which
she
firmly
believed
to
be
true
that
she
had
never
left
her
reticule
out
of
her
hand
and
that
melchior
had
only
touched
it
with
his
wand
raised
his
reputation
to
that
degree
that
nothing
else
was
talked
about
throughout
the
town
and
to
crown
all
the
next
day
post
brought
her
a
letter
and
remittances
from
her
son
and
the
grateful
woman
returned
and
laid
ten
guineas
on
the
black
cloth
showering
a
thousand
blessings
upon
melchior
and
almost
worshipped
him
as
a
supernatural
being
this
was
a
most
fortunate
occurrence
and
as
melchior
prophesied
the
harvest
did
now
commence
in
four
days
we
had
received
upwards
of
pounds
and
we
then
thought
it
time
that
we
should
depart
the
letters
arrived
which
were
expected
and
when
we
set
on
in
a
chaise
and
four
the
crowd
to
see
us
was
so
great
that
it
was
with
difficulty
we
could
pass
through
it
part
one
chapter
fourteen
in
which
melchior
talks
very
much
like
an
astrologer
and
tim
and
i
return
to
our
old
trade
of
making
up
innocent
prescriptions
we
had
taken
our
horses
for
the
next
town
but
as
soon
as
we
were
fairly
on
the
road
i
stopped
the
boys
and
told
them
that
the
great
aristodemus
intended
to
observe
the
planets
and
stars
that
night
and
that
they
were
to
proceed
to
a
common
which
i
mentioned
the
who
were
well
aware
of
his
fame
and
as
fully
persuaded
of
it
as
everybody
else
drove
to
the
common
we
descended
took
off
the
luggage
and
received
directions
from
melchior
in
their
presence
about
the
instruments
to
which
the
boys
listened
with
open
mouths
and
wonderment
i
paid
them
well
and
told
them
they
might
return
which
they
appeared
very
glad
to
do
they
reported
what
had
occurred
and
this
simple
method
of
regaining
our
camp
added
to
the
astonishment
of
the
good
town
of
when
they
were
out
of
sight
we
resumed
our
usual
clothes
packed
all
up
carried
away
most
of
our
effects
and
hid
the
others
in
the
furze
to
be
sent
for
the
next
night
not
being
more
than
two
miles
from
the
camp
we
soon
arrived
and
were
joyfully
received
by
fleta
and
nattee
as
we
walked
across
the
common
i
observed
to
melchior
i
wonder
if
these
stars
have
any
influence
upon
mortals
as
it
was
formerly
supposed
most
assuredly
they
have
rejoined
melchior
i
can
not
read
them
but
i
firmly
believe
in
them
i
made
the
above
remark
as
i
had
often
thought
that
such
was
idea
yes
continued
he
every
man
has
his
destiny
such
must
be
the
case
it
is
known
beforehand
what
is
to
happen
to
us
by
an
omniscient
being
and
being
known
what
is
it
but
destiny
which
can
not
be
changed
it
is
continued
he
surveying
the
stars
with
his
hand
raised
up
and
that
fate
is
as
surely
written
there
as
the
sun
shines
upon
us
but
the
great
book
is
sealed
because
it
would
not
add
to
our
happiness
if
then
all
is
destiny
or
fate
what
inducement
is
there
to
do
well
or
ill
replied
i
we
may
commit
all
acts
of
evil
and
say
that
as
it
was
predestined
we
could
not
help
it
besides
would
it
be
just
that
the
omniscient
being
should
punish
us
for
those
crimes
which
we
can
not
prevent
and
which
are
allotted
to
us
by
destiny
japhet
you
argue
well
but
you
are
in
error
because
like
most
of
those
of
the
christian
church
you
understand
not
the
sacred
writings
nor
did
i
until
i
knew
my
wife
her
creed
is
i
believe
correct
and
what
is
more
adds
weight
to
the
truths
of
the
bible
i
thought
that
gipsies
had
no
religion
you
are
not
the
only
one
who
supposes
so
it
is
true
that
the
majority
of
the
tribe
are
held
by
the
higher
castes
as
serfs
and
are
not
instructed
but
with
if
i
may
use
the
expression
the
aristocracy
of
them
it
is
very
different
and
their
creed
i
have
adopted
i
should
wish
to
hear
their
creed
replied
i
hear
it
then
original
sin
commenced
in
heaven
when
the
angels
rebelled
against
their
god
not
on
earth
i
will
grant
that
sin
originated
first
in
heaven
do
you
think
that
a
great
a
good
god
ever
created
any
being
for
its
destruction
and
eternal
misery
much
less
an
angel
did
he
not
foresee
their
rebellion
i
grant
it
this
world
was
not
peopled
with
the
image
of
god
until
after
the
fall
of
the
angels
it
had
its
living
beings
its
monsters
perhaps
but
not
a
race
of
men
with
eternal
souls
but
it
was
peopled
as
we
see
it
now
is
to
enable
the
legions
of
angels
who
fell
to
return
to
their
former
happy
state
as
a
pilgrimage
by
which
they
might
obtain
their
pardons
and
resume
their
seats
in
heaven
not
a
child
is
born
but
the
soul
of
some
fallen
cherub
enters
into
the
body
to
work
out
its
salvation
many
do
many
do
not
and
then
they
have
their
task
to
recommence
anew
for
the
spirit
once
created
is
immortal
and
can
not
be
destroyed
and
the
almighty
is
all
goodness
and
would
ever
pardon
then
you
suppose
there
is
no
such
thing
as
eternal
punishment
eternal
no
punishment
there
is
but
not
eternal
when
the
legions
of
angels
fell
some
were
not
so
perverse
as
others
they
soon
their
seats
even
when
as
children
having
passed
through
the
slight
ordeal
they
have
been
summoned
back
to
heaven
but
others
who
from
their
infancy
show
how
bad
were
their
natures
have
many
pilgrimages
to
perform
before
they
can
be
purified
this
is
in
itself
a
punishment
what
other
punishment
they
incur
between
their
pilgrimages
we
know
not
but
this
is
certain
that
no
one
was
created
to
be
punished
eternally
but
all
this
is
but
assertion
replied
i
where
are
your
proofs
in
the
bible
some
day
or
other
i
will
show
them
to
you
but
now
we
are
at
the
camp
and
i
am
anxious
to
embrace
nattee
i
thought
for
some
time
upon
this
singular
creed
one
in
itself
not
militating
against
religion
but
at
the
same
time
i
could
not
call
to
mind
any
passages
by
which
it
could
be
supported
still
the
idea
was
beautiful
and
i
dwelt
upon
it
with
pleasure
i
have
before
observed
and
indeed
the
reader
must
have
gathered
from
my
narrative
that
melchior
was
no
common
personage
every
day
did
i
become
more
partial
to
him
and
more
pleased
with
our
erratic
life
what
scruples
i
had
at
first
gradually
wore
away
the
time
passed
quickly
and
although
i
would
occasionally
call
to
mind
the
original
object
of
my
setting
forth
i
would
satisfy
myself
by
the
reflection
that
there
was
yet
sufficient
time
little
fleta
was
now
my
constant
companion
when
in
the
camp
and
i
amused
myself
with
teaching
her
to
write
and
read
japhet
said
timothy
to
me
one
day
as
we
were
cutting
hazel
broach
wood
in
the
forest
i
do
see
that
you
get
on
very
fast
in
your
search
after
your
father
no
tim
i
do
not
but
i
am
gaining
a
knowledge
of
the
world
which
will
be
very
useful
to
me
when
i
recommence
the
search
and
what
is
more
i
am
saving
a
great
deal
of
money
to
enable
me
to
prosecute
it
what
did
melchior
give
you
after
we
left
twenty
guineas
which
with
what
i
had
before
make
more
than
fifty
and
he
gave
me
ten
which
makes
twenty
with
what
i
had
before
seventy
pounds
is
a
large
sum
yes
but
soon
spent
tim
we
must
work
a
little
longer
besides
i
can
not
leave
that
little
girl
she
was
never
intended
for
a
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
japhet
for
i
feel
as
you
do
she
shall
share
our
fortunes
a
glorious
prospect
truly
replied
i
laughing
but
never
mind
it
would
be
better
than
her
remaining
here
but
how
are
we
to
manage
that
ay
that
the
rub
but
there
is
time
enough
to
think
about
it
when
we
intend
to
quit
our
present
occupation
well
i
understand
from
melchior
that
we
are
to
start
in
a
few
days
what
is
it
to
be
japhet
oh
we
shall
be
at
home
we
are
to
cure
all
diseases
under
the
sun
we
commence
making
pills
so
we
may
think
ourselves
with
mr
cophagus
again
well
i
do
think
we
shall
have
some
fun
but
i
hope
melchior
wo
make
me
take
my
own
pills
to
prove
their
good
qualities
that
will
be
no
joke
o
no
num
is
kept
on
purpose
for
that
what
else
is
the
fool
good
for
the
next
week
was
employed
as
we
anticipated
boxes
of
pills
of
every
size
neatly
labelled
bottles
of
various
mixtures
chiefly
stimulants
were
corked
and
packed
up
powders
of
were
put
in
papers
but
at
all
events
there
was
nothing
hurtful
in
them
all
was
ready
and
accompanied
by
num
jumbo
and
fleta
being
left
at
home
we
set
off
melchior
assuming
the
dress
in
which
we
had
first
met
him
in
the
waggon
and
altering
his
appearance
so
completely
that
he
would
have
been
taken
for
at
least
sixty
years
old
we
now
travelled
on
foot
with
our
dresses
in
bundles
each
carrying
his
own
except
num
who
was
loaded
like
a
and
made
sore
lamentations
ca
you
carry
some
of
this
no
replied
i
it
is
your
own
luggage
everyone
must
carry
his
own
well
i
never
felt
my
spangled
dress
so
heavy
before
where
are
we
going
only
a
little
way
replied
timothy
and
then
you
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
i
do
know
that
when
master
puts
on
that
dress
i
have
to
swallow
little
things
till
i
sick
it
all
good
for
your
health
num
i
very
well
i
replied
the
poor
fellow
but
i
very
hot
and
very
tired
part
one
chapter
fifteen
in
which
timothy
makes
a
grand
speech
quite
as
true
as
those
delivered
from
the
hustings
melchior
like
the
candidate
states
his
pretensions
for
public
favour
and
the
public
as
usual
swallow
the
bait
fortunately
for
poor
num
we
were
not
far
from
the
market

at
which
we
intended
to
open
our
campaign

we
did

next

rode

parts

grandiloquent
announcement
followed
as
may
be
supposed
by
a
numerous
cortege
of
little
ragged
boys
about
four
in
the
afternoon
melchior
made
his
appearance
in
the

sounded
before
great
conquerors
very
true
sir
but
how
am
i
a
great
conqueror
you
have
conquered
death
sir
and
he
a
very
rum
customer
to
have
to
deal
with
dionysius
you
have
answered
well
and
shall
have
some
bullock
liver
for
your
supper
do
forget
to
remind
me
in
case
i
forget
it
no
that
i
wo
sir
replied
timothy
rubbing
his
stomach
as
if
delighted
with
the
idea
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
melchior
to
the
audience
who
were
on
the
broad
grin
i
see
your
souths
are
all
open
and
are
waiting
for
the
pills
but
a
lot
too
impatient
i
can
not
part
with
my
medicine
unless
you
have
diseases
which
require
their
aid
and
i
should
indeed
be
a
sorry
doctor
if
i
prescribed
without
knowing
your
complaints
neutrale
genus
signans
rem
non
says
herodotus
which
in
english
means
what
is
one
man
meat
is
another
man
poison
and
further
he
adds
jecur
ut
onus
put
ut
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
what
agrees
with
one
temperament
will
be
injurious
to
another
caution
therefore
becomes
very
necessary
in
the
use
of
medicine
and
my
reputation
depends
upon
my
not
permitting
anyone
to
take
what
is
not
good
for
him
and
now
my
very
dear
friends
i
will
first
beg
you
to
observe
the
peculiar
qualities
of
the
contents
of
this
little
phial
you
observe
that
there
is
not
more
than
sixty
drops
in
it
yet
will
these
sixty
drops
add
ten
years
to
a
man
life
for
it
will
cure
him
of
almost
as
many
diseases
in
the
first
place
are
any
of
you
troubled
with
the
or
dropsy
which
as
the
celebrated
galen
hath
declared
may
be
divided
into
three
parts
the
the
and
the
the
diagnostics
of
this
disease
are
swelling
of
the
abdomen
or
stomach
difficulty
of
breathing
want
of
appetite
and
a
teazing
cough
i
say
have
any
of
you
this
disease
none
then
i
thank
heaven
that
you
are
not
so
afflicted
the
next
disease
it
is
good
for
is
the
or
inflammation
on
the
lungs
the
diagnostics
or
symptoms
of
which
are
a
small
pulse
swelling
of
the
eyes
and
redness
of
the
face
say
have
any
of
you
these
symptoms
if
so
you
have
the
disease
no
one
i
thank
heaven
that
you
are
none
of
you
so
afflicted
it
is
also
a
sovereign
remedy
for
the
the
diagnostics
of
which
are
faintness
frequent
gripings
rumbling
in
the
bowels
cold
sweats
and
spasm
here
one
man
came
forward
and
complained
of
frequent
gripings
another
of
rumbling
in
the
bowels
and
two
or
three
more
of
cold
sweats
it
is
well
o
i
thank
heaven
that
i
am
here
to
administer
to
you
myself
for
what
says
hippocrates
cum
antecedente
which
means
that
remedies
quickly
applied
kill
the
disease
in
its
birth
here
my
friends
take
it
take
it
pay
me
only
one
shilling
and
be
thankful
when
you
go
to
rest
fail
not
to
offer
up
your
prayers
it
is
also
a
sovereign
remedy
for
the
dreadful
or
gout
i
cured
the
whole
corporation
of
city
aldermen
last
week
by
their
taking
three
bottles
each
and
they
presented
me
with
the
freedom
of
the
city
of
london
in
a
gold
box
which
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
forgotten
to
bring
with
me
now
the
may
be
divided
into
several
varieties
when
it
attacks
the
knees
if
in
the
hands
if
in
the
elbow
if
in
the
shoulder
and
if
in
the
back
all
these
are
varieties
of
gout
and
for
all
these
the
contents
of
this
little
bottle
is
a
sovereign
remedy
and
observe
it
will
keep
for
ever
twenty
years
hence
when
afflicted
in
your
old
age
and
the
time
will
come
my
good
people
you
may
take
down
this
little
phial
from
the
shelf
and
bless
the
hour
in
which
you
spent
your
shilling
for
as
eusebius
declares
personate
concordat
cum
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
the
active
will
grow
old
and
suffer
from
pains
in
their
limbs
who
then
has
pains
in
his
limbs
or
lumbago
who
indeed
can
say
that
he
will
not
have
them
after
this
appeal
the
number
of
those
who
had
pains
in
their
limbs
or
who
wished
to
provide
against
such
a
disease
proved
so
great
that
all
our
phials
were
disposed
of
and
the
doctor
was
obliged
to
promise
that
in
a
few
days
he
would
have
some
more
of
this
invaluable
medicine
ready
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
shall
now
offer
to
your
notice
a
valuable
plaster
the
effects
of
which
are
miraculous
dionysius
come
hither
you
have
felt
the
benefit
of
this
plaster
tell
your
case
to
those
who
are
present
and
mind
you
tell
the
truth
hereupon
timothy
stepped
forward
ladies
and
gentlemen
my
about
three
weeks
back
i
fell
off
the
scaffold
broke
my
back
bone
into
three
pieces
and
was
carried
off
to
a
surgeon
who
looked
at
me
and
told
the
people
to
take
measure
for
my
coffin
the
great
doctor
was
not
there
at
the
time
having
been
sent
for
to
consult
with
the
king
physicians
upon
the
queen
case
of
or
intermitting
mortification
of
the
great
toe
but
fortunately
just
as
they
were
putting
me
into
a
shell
my
master
came
back
and
immediately
applying
his
sovereign
plaster
to
my
back
in
five
days
i
was
able
to
sit
up
and
in
ten
days
i
returned
to
my
duty
are
you
quite
well
now
dionysius
quite
well
sir
and
my
back
is
like
whalebone
try
it
hereupon
dionysius
threw
two
somersets
forward
two
backward
walked
across
the
stage
on
his
hands
and
tumbled
in
every
direction
you
see
gentlemen
i
quite
well
now
and
what
i
have
said
i
assure
you
my
to
be
a
fact
i
hope
you
allow
that
to
be
a
very
pretty
cure
said
the
doctor
appealing
to
the
audience
and
i
hardly
need
say
that
for
sprains
bruises
contusions
wrenches
and
dislocations
this
plaster
is
infallible
and
i
will
surprise
you
more
by
telling
you
that
i
can
sell
it
for
a
sheet
the
plaster
went
off
rapidly
and
was
soon
expended
the
doctor
went
on
describing
his
other
valuable
articles
and
when
he
came
to
his
cosmetics
etcetera
for
women
we
could
not
hand
them
out
fast
enough
and
now
said
the
doctor
i
must
bid
you
farewell
for
this
evening
i
glad
of
that
said
timothy
for
now
i
mean
to
sell
my
own
medicine
your
medicine
mr
dionysius
what
do
you
mean
by
that
mean
sir
i
mean
to
say
that
i
got
a
powder
of
my
own
contriving
which
is
a
sovereign
remedy
remedy
sir
for
what
why
it
a
powder
to
kill
fleas
and
what
more
it
just
as
infallible
as
your
own
have
you
indeed
and
pray
sir
how
did
you
hit
upon
the
invention
sir
i
discovered
it
in
my
sleep
by
accident
but
i
have
proved
it
and
i
will
say
if
properly
administered
it
is
quite
as
infallible
as
any
of
yours
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
pledge
you
my
honour
that
it
will
have
the
effect
desired
and
all
i
ask
is
sixpence
a
powder
but
how
is
it
to
be
used
sir
used
why
like
all
other
powders
but
i
wo
give
the
directions
till
i
have
sold
some
promising
however
if
my
method
does
not
succeed
to
return
the
money
well
that
is
fair
mr
dionysius
and
i
will
take
care
that
you
keep
your
bargain
will
anybody
purchase
the
fool
powder
for
killing
fleas
yes
i
will
replied
a
man
on
the
broad
grin
here
sixpence
now
then
fool
how
am
i
to
use
it
use
it
said
timothy
putting
the
sixpence
in
his
pocket
explain
to
you
you
must
first
catch
the
flea
hold
him
so
tight
between
the
forefinger
and
thumb
as
to
force
him
to
open
his
mouth
when
his
mouth
is
open
you
must
put
a
very
little
of
this
powder
into
it
and
it
will
kill
him
directly
why
when
i
have
the
flea
as
tight
as
you
state
i
may
as
well
kill
him
myself
very
true
so
you
may
if
you
prefer
it
but
if
you
do
not
you
may
use
this
powder
which
upon
my
honour
is
infallible
this
occasioned
a
great
deal
of
mirth
among
the
bystanders
timothy
kept
his
sixpence
and
our
exhibition
for
this
day
ended
very
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
melchior
who
declared
he
had
taken
more
than
ever
he
had
done
before
in
a
whole
week
indeed
the
whole
sum
amounted
to
pounds
shillings
all
taken
in
shillings
and
sixpences
for
articles
hardly
worth
the
odd
shillings
in
the
account
so
we
sat
down
to
supper
with
anticipations
of
a
good
harvest
and
so
it
proved
we
stayed
four
days
at
this
town
and
then
proceeded
onwards
when
the
like
success
attended
us
timothy
and
i
being
obliged
to
sit
up
nearly
the
whole
night
to
label
and
roll
up
pills
and
mix
medicines
which
we
did
in
a
very
scientific
manner
nor
was
it
always
that
melchior
presided
he
would
very
often
tell
his
audience
that
business
required
his
attendance
elsewhere
to
visit
the
sick
and
that
he
left
the
explanation
of
his
medicines
and
their
properties
to
his
pupil
who
was
far
advanced
in
knowledge
with
my
prepossessing
appearance
i
made
a
great
effect
more
especially
among
the
ladies
and
timothy
exerted
himself
so
much
when
with
me
that
we
never
failed
to
bring
home
to
melchior
a
great
addition
to
his
earnings
so
much
so
that
at
last
he
only
showed
himself
pretended
that
he
was
so
importuned
to
visit
sick
persons
that
he
could
stay
no
longer
and
then
leave
us
after
the
first
half
hour
to
carry
on
the
business
for
him
after
six
weeks
of
uninterrupted
success
we
returned
to
the
camp
which
as
usual
was
not
very
very
far
off
part
one
chapter
sixteen
important
news
but
not
communicated
a
dissolution
or
partnership
takes
place
melchior
profits
had
been
much
more
than
he
anticipated
and
he
was
very
liberal
to
timothy
and
myself
indeed
he
looked
upon
me
as
his
right
hand
and
became
more
intimate
and
attached
every
day
we
were
of
course
delighted
to
return
to
the
camp
after
our
excursion
there
was
so
much
continued
bustle
and
excitement
in
our
peculiar
profession
that
a
little
quiet
was
delightful
and
i
never
felt
more
happy
than
when
fleta
threw
herself
into
my
arms
and
nattee
came
forward
with
her
usual
dignity
and
grace
but
with
more
than
usual
condescendence
and
kindness
bidding
me
welcome
home
home
alas
it
was
never
meant
for
my
home
or
poor
fleta
and
that
i
felt
it
was
our
sojourn
for
a
time
and
no
more
we
had
been
more
than
a
year
exercising
our
talents
in
this
lucrative
manner
when
one
day
as
i
was
sitting
at
the
entrance
to
the
tent
with
a
book
in
my
hand
out
of
which
fleta
was
reading
to
me
a
gipsy
not
belonging
to
our
gang
made
his
appearance
he
was
covered
with
dust
and
the
dew
drops
hanging
on
his
dark
forehead
proved
that
he
had
travelled
fast
he
addressed
nattee
who
was
standing
by
in
their
own
language
which
i
did
not
understand
but
i
perceived
that
he
asked
for
melchior
after
an
exchange
of
a
few
sentences
nattee
expressed
astonishment
and
alarm
put
her
hands
over
her
face
and
removed
them
as
quickly
as
if
derogatory
in
her
to
show
emotion
and
then
remained
in
deep
thought
perceiving
melchior
approaching
the
gipsy
hastened
to
him
and
they
were
soon
in
animated
conversation
in
ten
minutes
it
was
over
the
gipsy
went
to
the
running
brook
washed
his
face
took
a
large
draught
of
water
and
then
hastened
away
and
was
soon
out
of
sight
melchior
who
had
watched
the
departure
of
the
gipsy
slowly
approached
us
i
observed
him
and
nattee
as
they
met
as
i
was
certain
that
something
important
had
taken
place
melchior
fixed
his
eyes
upon
nattee
she
looked
at
him
mournfully
folded
her
arms
and
made
a
slight
bow
as
if
in
submission
and
in
a
low
voice
quoted
from
the
scriptures
whither
thou
goest
i
will
go
thy
people
shall
be
my
people
and
thy
god
my
god
he
then
walked
away
with
her
they
sat
down
apart
and
were
in
earnest
conversation
for
more
than
an
hour
japhet
said
melchior
to
me
after
he
had
quitted
his
wife
what
i
am
about
to
tell
you
will
surprise
you
i
have
trusted
you
with
all
i
dare
trust
anyone
but
there
are
some
secrets
in
every
man
life
which
had
better
be
reserved
for
himself
and
her
who
is
bound
to
him
by
solemn
ties
we
must
now
part
in
a
few
days
this
camp
will
be
broken
up
and
these
people
will
join
some
other
division
of
the
tribe
for
me
you
will
see
me
no
more
ask
me
not
to
explain
for
i
can
not
and
nattee
said
i
will
follow
my
fortunes
whatever
they
may
be
you
will
see
her
no
more
for
myself
i
care
not
melchior
the
world
is
before
me
and
remain
with
the
gipsies
without
you
i
will
not
but
answer
me
one
question
what
is
to
become
of
little
fleta
is
she
to
remain
with
the
tribe
to
which
she
does
not
belong
or
does
she
go
with
you
melchior
hesitated
i
hardly
can
answer
but
what
consequence
can
the
welfare
of
a
soldier
brat
be
to
you
allowing
her
to
be
what
you
assert
melchior
i
am
devotedly
attached
to
that
child
and
could
not
bear
that
she
should
remain
here
i
am
sure
that
you
deceived
me
in
what
you
stated
for
the
child
remembers
and
has
told
me
anecdotes
of
her
infancy
which
proves
that
she
is
of
no
mean
family
and
that
she
has
been
stolen
from
her
friends
indeed
is
her
memory
so
good
replied
melchior
firmly
closing
his
teeth
to
nattee
or
to
me
she
has
never
hinted
so
much
that
is
very
probable
but
a
stolen
child
she
is
melchior
and
she
must
not
remain
here
must
not
yes
must
not
melchior
when
you
quit
the
tribe
you
will
no
longer
have
any
power
nor
can
you
have
any
interest
about
her
she
shall
then
choose
if
she
will
come
with
me
i
will
take
her
and
nothing
shall
prevent
me
and
in
so
doing
i
do
you
no
injustice
nor
do
i
swerve
in
my
fidelity
how
do
you
know
that
i
may
have
my
secret
reasons
against
it
surely
you
can
have
no
interest
in
a
soldier
brat
melchior
melchior
appeared
confused
and
annoyed
she
is
no
soldier
brat
i
acknowledge
japhet
that
the
child
was
stolen
but
you
must
not
therefore
imply
that
the
child
was
stolen
by
me
or
by
my
wife
i
never
accused
you
or
thought
you
capable
of
it
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i
am
now
surprised
at
the
interest
you
take
in
her
if
she
prefers
to
go
with
you
have
no
more
to
say
but
if
not
i
claim
her
and
if
she
consents
will
resist
your
interference
japhet
replied
melchior
after
a
pause
we
must
not
quarrel
now
that
we
are
about
to
part
i
will
give
you
an
answer
in
half
an
hour
melchior
returned
to
nattee
and
recommenced
a
conversation
with
her
while
i
hastened
to
fleta
fleta
do
you
know
that
the
camp
is
to
be
broken
up
and
melchior
and
nattee
leave
it
together
indeed
replied
she
with
surprise
then
what
is
to
become
of
you
and
timothy
we
must
of
course
seek
our
fortunes
where
we
can
and
of
me
continued
she
looking
me
earnestly
in
the
face
with
her
large
blue
eyes
am
i
to
stay
here
continued
she
with
alarm
in
her
countenance
not
if
you
do
not
wish
it
fleta
as
long
as
i
can
support
you
i
will
that
is
if
you
would
like
to
live
with
me
in
preference
to
melchior
if
i
would
like
japhet
you
must
know
i
would
like
who
has
been
so
kind
to
me
as
you
do
leave
me
japhet
i
will
not
fleta
but
on
condition
that
you
promise
to
be
guided
by
me
and
to
do
all
i
wish
to
do
what
you
wish
is
the
greatest
pleasure
that
i
have
japhet
so
i
may
safely
promise
that
what
has
happened
that
i
do
not
know
more
than
yourself
but
melchior
tells
me
that
he
and
nattee
quit
the
gipsy
tents
for
ever
fleta
looked
round
to
ascertain
if
anyone
was
near
us
and
then
in
a
low
tone
said
i
understand
their
language
japhet
that
is
a
great
deal
of
it
although
they
do
not
think
so
and
i
overheard
what
the
gipsy
said
in
part
although
he
was
at
some
distance
he
asked
for
melchior
and
when
nattee
wanted
to
know
what
he
wanted
he
answered
that
he
was
dead
then
nattee
covered
up
her
face
i
could
not
hear
all
the
rest
but
there
was
something
about
a
was
had
then
melchior
committed
murder
and
was
obliged
to
fly
the
country
this
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
most
probable
when
i
collected
the
facts
in
my
possession
and
yet
i
could
not
believe
it
for
except
that
system
of
deceit
necessary
to
carry
on
his
various
professions
i
never
found
anything
in
melchior
conduct
which
could
be
considered
as
criminal
on
the
contrary
he
was
kind
generous
and
upright
in
his
private
dealings
and
in
many
points
proved
that
he
had
a
good
heart
he
was
a
riddle
of
inconsistency
it
was
certain
professionally
he
would
cheat
anybody
and
disregard
all
truth
and
honesty
but
in
his
private
character
he
was
scrupulously
honest
and
with
the
exception
of
the
assertion
relative
to
fleta
birth
and
parentage
he
had
never
told
me
a
lie
that
i
could
discover
i
was
summing
up
all
these
reflections
in
my
mind
when
melchior
again
came
up
to
me
and
desiring
the
little
girl
to
go
away
he
said
japhet
i
have
resolved
to
grant
your
request
with
respect
to
fleta
but
it
must
be
on
conditions
let
me
hear
them
first
then
japhet
as
you
always
have
been
honest
and
confiding
with
me
tell
me
now
what
are
your
intentions
do
you
mean
to
follow
up
the
profession
which
you
learnt
under
me
or
what
do
you
intend
to
do
honestly
then
melchior
i
do
not
intend
to
follow
up
that
profession
unless
driven
to
it
by
necessity
i
intend
to
seek
my
father
and
if
driven
to
it
by
necessity
do
you
intend
that
fleta
shall
aid
you
by
her
acquirements
in
short
do
you
mean
to
take
her
with
you
as
a
speculation
to
make
the
most
of
her
to
let
her
sink
when
she
arrives
at
the
age
of
woman
into
vice
and
misery
i
wonder
at
your
asking
me
that
question
melchior
it
is
the
first
act
of
injustice
i
have
received
at
your
hands
no
if
obliged
to
follow
up
the
profession
i
will
not
allow
fleta
so
to
do
i
would
sooner
that
she
were
in
her
grave
it
is
to
rescue
her
from
that
very
vice
and
misery
to
take
her
out
of
a
society
in
which
she
never
ought
to
have
been
placed
that
i
take
her
with
me
and
this
upon
your
honour
yes
upon
my
honour
i
love
her
as
my
sister
and
can
not
help
indulging
in
the
hope
that
in
seeking
my
father
i
may
chance
to
stumble
upon
hers
melchior
bit
his
lips
there
is
another
promise
i
must
exact
from
you
japhet
which
is
that
to
a
direction
which
i
will
give
you
every
six
months
you
will
enclose
an
address
where
you
may
be
heard
of
and
also
intelligence
as
to
fleta
welfare
and
health
to
that
i
give
my
cheerful
promise
but
melchior
you
appear
to
have
taken
all
at
once
a
strange
interest
in
this
little
girl
i
wish
you
now
to
think
that
i
do
take
an
interest
in
her
provided
you
seek
not
to
inquire
the
why
and
the
wherefore
will
you
accept
of
funds
for
her
maintenance
not
without
necessity
compels
me
and
then
i
should
be
glad
to
find
when
i
can
no
longer
help
her
that
you
are
still
her
friend
recollect
that
you
will
always
find
what
is
requisite
by
writing
to
the
address
which
i
shall
give
you
before
we
part
that
point
is
now
settled
and
on
the
whole
i
think
the
arrangement
is
good
timothy
had
been
absent
during
the
events
of
the
morning
when
he
returned
i
communicated
to
him
what
had
passed
and
was
about
to
take
place
well
japhet
i
do
know
i
do
not
dislike
our
present
life
yet
i
am
not
sorry
to
change
it
but
what
are
we
to
do
that
remains
to
be
considered
we
have
a
good
stock
of
money
fortunately
and
we
must
husband
it
till
we
find
what
can
be
done
we
took
our
suppers
all
together
for
the
last
time
melchior
telling
us
that
he
had
determined
to
set
off
the
next
day
nattee
looked
very
melancholy
but
resigned
on
the
contrary
little
fleta
was
so
overjoyed
that
her
face
generally
so
mournful
was
illuminated
with
smiles
whenever
our
eyes
met
it
was
delightful
to
see
her
so
happy
the
whole
of
the
people
in
the
camp
had
retired
and
melchior
was
busy
making
his
arrangements
in
the
tent
i
did
not
feel
inclined
to
sleep
i
was
thinking
and
revolving
in
my
mind
my
prospects
for
the
future
sitting
or
rather
lying
down
for
i
was
leaning
on
my
elbow
at
a
short
distance
from
the
tents
the
night
was
dark
but
clear
and
the
stars
were
brilliant
i
had
been
watching
them
and
i
thought
upon
ideas
of
destiny
and
dwelling
on
the
futile
wish
that
i
could
read
mine
when
i
perceived
the
approach
of
nattee
japhet
said
she
you
are
to
take
the
little
girl
with
you
i
find
will
you
be
careful
of
her
for
it
would
be
on
my
conscience
if
she
were
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
world
she
departs
rejoicing
let
not
her
joy
end
in
tears
i
depart
sorrowing
i
leave
my
people
my
kin
my
habits
and
customs
my
influence
all
but
it
must
be
so
it
is
my
destiny
she
is
a
good
child
japhet
promise
me
that
you
will
be
a
friend
to
her
and
give
her
this
to
wear
in
remembrance
of
me
but
not
yet
not
till
we
are
gone
she
hesitated
japhet
do
not
let
melchior
see
it
in
your
possession
he
may
not
like
me
having
given
it
away
i
took
the
piece
of
paper
containing
the
present
and
having
promised
all
she
required
this
is
the
last
yes
the
very
last
time
that
i
may
behold
this
scene
continued
nattee
surveying
the
common
the
tents
and
the
animals
browsing
be
it
so
japhet
good
night
may
you
prosper
she
then
turned
away
and
entered
her
tent
and
soon
afterwards
i
followed
her
example
the
next
day
melchior
was
all
ready
what
he
had
packed
up
was
contained
in
two
small
bundles
he
addressed
the
people
belonging
to
the
gang
in
their
own
language
nattee
did
the
same
and
the
whole
of
them
kissed
her
hand
the
tents
furniture
and
the
greatest
part
of
his
other
property
were
distributed
among
them
jumbo
and
num
were
made
over
to
two
of
the
principal
men
timothy
fleta
and
i
were
also
ready
and
intended
to
quit
at
the
same
time
as
melchior
and
his
wife
japhet
said
melchior
there
is
yet
some
money
due
to
you
for
our
last
excursion
this
was
true
here
it
is
you
and
timothy
keep
but
one
purse
i
am
aware
and
may
you
prosper
we
shook
hands
with
nattee
and
melchior
fleta
went
up
to
the
former
and
crossing
her
arms
bent
her
head
nattee
kissed
the
child
and
led
her
to
melchior
he
stooped
down
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
i
perceived
a
sign
of
strongly
suppressed
emotion
as
he
did
so
our
intended
routes
lay
in
a
different
direction
and
when
both
parties
had
arrived
to
either
verge
of
the
common
we
waved
our
hands
as
a
last
farewell
and
resumed
our
paths
again
fleta
burst
into
tears
as
she
turned
away
from
her
former
guardians
part
one
chapter
seventeen
a
cabinet
council
i
resolve
to
set
up
as
a
gentleman
having
as
legitimate
pretensions
to
the
rank
of
one
as
many
others
i
led
the
little
sobbing
girl
by
the
hand
and
we
proceeded
for
some
time
in
silence
it
was
not
until
we
gained
the
high
road
that
timothy
interrupted
my
reverie
by
observing
japhet
have
you
at
all
made
up
your
mind
what
you
shall
do
i
have
been
reflecting
timothy
we
have
lost
a
great
deal
of
time
the
original
intention
with
which
i
left
london
has
been
almost
forgotten
but
it
must
be
so
no
longer
i
now
have
resolved
that
as
soon
as
i
have
placed
this
poor
little
girl
in
safety
that
i
will
prosecute
my
search
and
never
be
diverted
from
it
i
can
not
agree
with
you
that
we
have
lost
time
japhet
we
had
very
little
money
when
we
started
upon
our
expedition
and
now
we
have
sufficient
to
enable
you
to
prosecute
your
plans
for
a
long
time
the
question
is
in
what
direction
we
quitted
london
and
travelled
west
in
imitation
as
we
thought
of
the
with
all
deference
in
my
opinion
it
was
like
i
have
been
thinking
upon
that
point
also
tim
and
i
agree
with
you
i
expect
from
several
causes
which
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
to
find
my
father
among
the
higher
classes
of
society
and
the
path
we
took
when
we
started
has
led
us
into
the
very
lowest
it
appears
to
me
that
we
can
not
do
better
than
retrace
our
steps
we
have
the
means
now
to
appear
as
gentlemen
and
to
mix
in
good
company
and
london
is
the
very
best
place
for
us
to
repair
to
that
is
precisely
my
opinion
japhet
with
one
single
exception
which
i
will
mention
to
you
but
first
tell
me
have
you
calculated
what
our
joint
purses
may
amount
to
it
must
be
a
very
considerable
sum
i
had
not
examined
the
packet
in
which
was
the
money
which
melchior
had
given
me
at
parting
i
now
opened
it
and
found
to
my
surprise
that
there
were
bank
notes
to
the
amount
of
one
hundred
pounds
i
felt
that
he
had
given
me
this
large
sum
that
it
might
assist
me
in
expenses
with
this
sum
said
i
i
can
not
have
much
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
i
have
more
than
sixty
said
timothy
really
the
profession
was
not
unprofitable
no
replied
i
laughing
but
recollect
tim
that
we
had
no
outlay
the
public
provided
us
with
food
our
lodging
cost
us
nothing
we
have
had
no
taxes
to
pay
and
at
the
same
time
have
taxed
folly
and
credulity
to
a
great
extent
that
true
japhet
and
although
i
am
glad
to
have
the
money
i
am
not
sorry
that
we
have
abandoned
the
profession
nor
am
i
tim
if
you
please
we
will
forget
it
altogether
but
tell
me
what
was
the
exception
you
were
about
to
make
simply
this
although
upwards
of
three
hundred
pounds
may
be
a
great
deal
of
money
yet
if
we
are
to
support
the
character
and
appearance
of
gentlemen
it
will
not
last
for
ever
for
instance
we
must
have
our
what
an
expense
that
will
be
our
clothes
too
we
shall
soon
lose
our
rank
and
station
in
society
without
we
obtain
a
situation
under
government
we
must
make
it
last
as
long
as
we
can
timothy
and
trust
to
good
fortune
to
assist
us
that
all
very
well
japhet
but
i
had
rather
trust
to
our
own
prudence
now
hear
what
i
have
to
say
you
will
be
as
much
assisted
by
a
valet
as
by
any
other
means
i
shall
as
a
gentleman
be
only
an
expense
and
an
incumbrance
but
as
a
valet
i
shall
be
able
to
play
into
your
hands
at
the
same
time
more
than
one
half
the
expense
will
be
avoided
with
your
leave
therefore
i
will
take
my
proper
situation
put
on
your
livery
and
thereby
make
myself
of
the
greatest
use
i
could
not
help
acknowledging
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
this
proposal
of
timothy
but
i
did
not
like
to
accept
it
it
is
very
kind
of
you
timothy
replied
i
but
i
can
only
look
upon
you
as
a
friend
and
an
equal
there
you
are
right
and
are
wrong
in
the
same
breath
you
are
right
in
looking
upon
me
as
a
friend
japhet
and
you
would
be
still
more
right
in
allowing
me
to
prove
my
friendship
as
i
propose
but
you
are
wrong
in
looking
upon
me
as
an
equal
for
i
am
not
so
either
in
personal
appearance
education
or
anything
else
we
are
both
foundlings
it
is
true
but
you
were
christened
after
abraham
newland
and
i
after
the
workhouse
pump
you
were
a
gentleman
foundling
presenting
yourself
with
a
note
and
good
clothes
i
made
my
appearance
in
rags
and
misery
if
you
find
your
parents
you
will
rise
in
the
world
if
i
find
mine
i
shall
in
all
probability
have
no
reason
to
be
proud
of
them
i
therefore
must
insist
upon
having
my
own
choice
in
the
part
i
am
to
play
in
the
drama
and
i
will
prove
to
you
that
it
is
my
right
to
choose
you
forget
that
when
we
started
your
object
was
to
search
after
your
father
and
i
told
you
mine
should
be
to
look
after
my
mother
you
have
selected
high
life
as
the
expected
sphere
in
which
he
is
to
be
found
and
i
select
low
life
as
that
in
which
i
am
most
likely
to
discover
the
object
of
my
search
so
you
perceive
continued
tim
laughing
that
we
must
arrange
so
as
to
suit
the
views
of
both
without
parting
company
do
you
hunt
among
canes
silks
and
satins
i
will
burrow
among
tags
and
tassels
dimity
and
mob
caps
and
probably
we
shall
both
succeed
in
the
object
of
our
search
i
leave
you
to
hunt
in
the
while
i
ferret
in
the
kitchen
you
may
throw
yourself
on
a
sofa
and
exclaim
is
my
father
while
i
will
sit
in
the
cook
lap
and
ask
her
if
she
may
happen
to
be
my
mother
this
sally
of
timothy
made
even
fleta
laugh
and
after
a
little
more
remonstrance
i
consented
that
he
should
perform
the
part
of
my
valet
indeed
the
more
i
reflected
upon
it
the
greater
appeared
the
advantages
which
might
accrue
from
the
arrangement
by
the
time
that
this
point
had
been
settled
we
had
arrived
at
the
town
to
which
we
directed
our
steps
and
took
up
our
quarters
at
an
inn
of
moderate
pretensions
but
of
very
great
external
cleanliness
my
first
object
was
to
find
out
some
fitting
asylum
for
little
fleta
the
landlady
was
a
buxom
young
woman
and
i
gave
the
little
girl
into
her
charge
while
timothy
and
i
went
out
on
a
survey
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
put
her
to
some
good
but
not
very
expensive
school
if
such
were
to
be
found
in
the
vicinity
i
should
have
preferred
taking
her
with
me
to
london
but
i
was
aware
how
much
more
expensive
it
would
be
to
provide
for
her
there
and
as
the
distance
from
the
metropolis
was
but
twenty
miles
i
could
easily
run
down
to
see
her
occasionally
i
desired
the
little
girl
to
call
me
her
brother
as
such
i
intended
to
be
to
her
in
future
and
not
to
answer
every
question
they
might
put
to
her
there
was
however
little
occasion
for
this
caution
for
fleta
was
as
i
before
observed
very
unlike
children
in
general
i
then
went
out
with
timothy
to
look
for
a
tailor
that
i
might
order
our
clothes
as
what
we
had
on
were
not
either
of
the
very
best
taste
or
in
the
very
best
condition
we
walked
up
the
main
street
and
soon
fell
in
with
a
tailor
shop
over
which
was
written
in
large
letters
feodor
shneider
tailor
to
his
royal
highness
the
prince
of
darmstadt
will
that
do
japhet
said
timothy
pointing
to
the
announcement
why
yes
replied
i
but
how
the
deuce
the
prince
of
darmstadt
should
have
employed
a
man
in
a
small
country
town
as
his
tailor
is
to
me
rather
a
puzzle
perhaps
he
made
his
clothes
when
he
was
in
germany
replied
tim
perhaps
he
did
but
however
he
shall
have
the
honour
of
making
mine
we
entered
the
shop
and
i
ordered
a
suit
of
the
most
fashionable
clothes
choosing
my
colours
and
being
very
minute
in
my
directions
to
the
foreman
who
measured
me
but
as
i
was
leaving
the
shop
the
master
judging
by
my
appearance
which
was
certainly
not
exactly
that
of
a
gentleman
ventured
to
observe
that
it
was
customary
with
whom
they
had
not
the
honour
of
knowing
to
leave
a
deposit
although
the
very
proposal
was
an
attack
upon
my
gentility
i
made
no
reply
but
pulling
out
a
handful
of
guineas
laid
down
two
on
the
counter
and
walked
away
that
i
might
find
another
shop
at
which
we
might
order
the
livery
of
timothy
but
this
was
only
as
a
reconnoitre
as
i
did
not
intend
to
order
his
liveries
until
i
could
appear
in
my
own
clothes
which
were
promised
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
there
were
however
several
other
articles
to
be
purchased
such
as
a
trunk
portmanteau
hat
gloves
etcetera
all
which
we
procured
and
then
went
back
to
the
inn
on
my
return
i
ordered
dinner
fleta
was
certainly
clad
in
her
best
frock
but
bad
was
the
best
and
the
landlady
who
could
extract
little
from
the
child
could
not
imagine
who
we
could
be
i
had
however
allowed
her
to
see
more
than
sufficient
money
to
warrant
our
expenses
and
so
far
her
scruples
were
although
her
curiosity
was
not
removed
that
evening
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
fleta
i
told
her
that
we
were
to
part
that
she
must
go
to
school
and
that
i
would
very
often
come
down
to
see
her
at
first
she
was
inconsolable
at
the
idea
but
i
reasoned
with
her
and
the
gentle
intelligent
creature
acknowledged
that
it
was
right
the
next
day
my
clothes
came
home
and
i
dressed
myself
without
flattery
japhet
said
timothy
you
do
look
very
much
like
a
gentleman
fleta
smiled
and
said
the
same
i
thought
so
too
but
said
nothing
putting
on
my
hat
and
gloves
and
accompanied
by
timothy
i
descended
to
go
out
and
order
tim
liveries
as
well
as
a
fitout
for
fleta
after
i
was
out
in
the
street
i
discovered
that
i
had
left
my
handkerchief
and
returned
to
fetch
it
the
landlady
seeing
a
gentleman
about
to
enter
the
inn
made
a
very
low
courtesy
and
it
was
not
until
i
looked
hard
at
her
that
she
recognised
me
then
i
was
satisfied
it
was
an
involuntary
tribute
to
my
appearance
worth
all
the
flattering
assertions
in
the
world
we
now
proceeded
to
the
other
tailor
in
the
main
street
i
entered
the
shop
with
a
flourishing
important
air
and
was
received
with
many
bows
i
wish
said
i
to
have
a
suit
of
livery
made
for
this
young
man
who
is
about
to
enter
into
my
service
i
can
not
take
him
up
to
town
this
figure
the
livery
was
chosen
and
as
i
expressed
my
wish
to
be
off
the
next
evening
it
was
promised
to
be
ready
by
an
hour
appointed
i
then
went
to
a
milliner
and
desired
that
she
would
call
at
the
inn
to
fit
out
a
little
girl
for
school
whose
wardrobe
had
been
left
behind
by
mistake
on
the
fourth
day
all
was
ready
i
had
made
inquiries
and
found
out
a
very
respectable
school
kept
by
a
widow
lady
i
asked
for
references
which
were
given
and
i
was
satisfied
the
terms
were
low
twenty
pounds
per
annum
i
paid
the
first
half
year
in
advance
and
lodged
fifty
guineas
more
in
the
hands
of
a
banker
taking
a
receipt
for
it
and
giving
directions
that
it
was
to
be
paid
to
the
schoolmistress
as
it
became
due
i
took
this
precaution
that
should
i
be
in
poverty
myself
at
all
events
fleta
might
be
provided
in
clothes
and
schooling
for
three
years
at
least
the
poor
child
wept
bitterly
at
the
separation
and
i
could
with
difficulty
detach
her
little
arms
from
my
neck
and
i
felt
when
i
left
her
as
if
i
had
parted
with
the
only
valuable
object
to
me
on
earth
all
was
now
ready
but
timothy
did
not
as
yet
assume
his
new
clothes
it
would
have
appeared
strange
that
one
who
sat
at
my
table
should
afterwards
put
on
my
livery
and
as
in
a
small
town
there
is
always
plenty
of
scandal
for
fleta
sake
if
for
no
other
reason
it
was
deferred
until
our
arrival
in
london
wishing
the
landlady
who
i
really
believed
would
have
given
up
her
bill
to
have
known
who
we
could
possibly
be
we
got
on
the
outside
of
the
and
in
the
evening
arrived
at
the
metropolis
i
have
been
particular
in
describing
all
these
little
circumstances
as
it
proves
how
very
awkward
it
is
to
jump
without
observation
from
one
station
in
society
to
another
part
one
chapter
eighteen
i
receive
a
letter
from
my
uncle
by
which
i
naturally
expect
to
find
out
who
is
my
father
like
other
outcasts
i
am
warned
by
a
dream
but
i
have
omitted
to
mention
a
circumstance
of
great
importance
which
occurred
at
the
inn
the
night
before
i
placed
fleta
at
the
in
looking
over
my
portmanteau
i
perceived
the
present
of
nattee
to
fleta
which
i
had
quite
forgotten
i
took
it
to
fleta
and
told
her
from
whom
it
came
on
opening
the
paper
it
proved
to
contain
a
long
chain
of
round
coral
and
gold
beads
strung
alternately
the
gold
beads
were
not
so
large
as
the
coral
but
still
the
number
of
them
and
the
purity
of
the
metal
made
them
of
considerable
value
fleta
passed
the
beads
through
her
fingers
and
then
threw
it
round
her
neck
and
sat
in
deep
thought
for
some
minutes
japhet
said
she
at
last
i
have
seen
this
i
have
worn
this
before
i
recollect
that
i
have
it
rushes
into
my
memory
as
an
old
friend
and
i
think
that
before
morning
it
will
bring
to
my
mind
something
that
i
shall
recollect
about
it
try
all
you
can
fleta
and
let
me
know
it
no
use
trying
if
i
try
i
never
can
recollect
anything
i
must
wear
it
and
then
i
shall
have
something
come
into
my
mind
all
of
a
sudden
or
perhaps
i
may
dream
something
good
night
it
immediately
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
most
probable
that
the
chain
had
been
on
fleta
neck
at
the
time
that
she
was
stolen
from
her
parents
and
might
prove
the
means
of
her
being
identified
it
was
no
common
chain
apparently
had
been
wrought
by
people
in
a
state
of
there
was
too
little
show
for
its
value
too
much
sterling
gold
for
the
simple
effect
produced
and
i
very
much
doubted
whether
another
like
it
could
be
found
the
next
morning
fleta
was
too
much
affected
at
parting
with
me
to
enter
into
much
conversation
i
asked
whether
she
had
recollected
anything
and
she
replied
no
that
she
had
cried
all
night
at
the
thoughts
of
our
separation
i
cautioned
her
to
be
very
careful
of
the
chain
and
i
gave
the
same
caution
to
the
schoolmistress
and
after
i
had
left
the
town
i
regretted
that
i
had
not
taken
it
away
and
deposited
it
in
some
place
of
security
i
resolved
to
do
so
when
i
next
saw
fleta
in
the
mean
time
she
would
be
able
perhaps
by
association
to
call
up
some
passage
of
her
infancy
connected
with
it
i
had
inquired
of
a
gentleman
who
sat
near
me
on
the
coach
which
was
the
best
hotel
for
a
young
man
of
fashion
he
recommended
the
piazza
in
covent
garden
and
to
that
we
accordingly
repaired
i
selected
handsome
apartments
and
ordered
a
light
supper
when
the
table
was
said
timothy
made
his
appearance
in
his
livery
and
cut
a
very
smart
dashing
figure
i
dismissed
the
waiter
and
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
i
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
really
timothy
this
is
a
good
farce
come
sit
down
and
help
me
to
finish
this
bottle
of
wine
no
sir
replied
timothy
with
your
permission
i
prefer
doing
as
the
rest
of
my
fraternity
you
only
leave
the
bottle
on
the
sideboard
and
i
will
steal
as
much
as
i
want
but
as
for
sitting
down
that
will
be
making
too
free
and
if
we
were
seen
would
be
moreover
very
dangerous
we
must
both
keep
up
our
characters
they
have
been
plying
me
with
all
manner
of
questions
below
as
to
who
you
were
your
name
etcetera
i
resolved
that
i
would
give
you
a
lift
in
the
world
and
i
stated
that
you
had
just
arrived
from
making
a
grand
tour
which
is
not
a
fib
after
all
and
as
for
your
name
i
said
that
you
were
all
present
but
why
did
you
make
me
because
it
may
suit
you
so
to
be
and
it
certainly
is
the
truth
for
you
do
know
your
real
name
we
were
here
interrupted
by
the
waiter
bringing
in
a
letter
upon
a
salver
here
is
a
letter
addressed
to
or
on
his
return
from
his
tour
sir
said
he
i
presume
it
is
for
you
you
may
leave
it
said
i
with
nonchalance
the
waiter
laid
the
letter
on
the
table
and
retired
how
very
odd
timothy
this
letter
can
not
be
for
me
and
yet
they
are
my
initials
it
is
as
much
like
a
j
as
an
i
depend
upon
it
it
is
some
fellow
who
has
just
gained
this
intelligence
below
and
has
written
to
ask
for
a
subscription
to
his
charity
list
imagining
that
i
am
flush
of
money
and
liberal
i
suppose
so
replied
tim
however
you
may
just
as
well
see
what
he
says
but
if
i
open
it
he
will
expect
something
i
had
better
refuse
it
oh
no
leave
that
to
me
i
know
how
to
put
people
off
after
all
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
a
gentleman
and
be
petitioned
i
broke
open
the
seal
and
found
that
the
letter
contained
an
enclosure
addressed
to
another
person
the
letter
was
as
follows
my
dear
nephew
sir
said
timothy
found
an
uncle
already
you
soon
find
a
father
from
the
great
uncertainty
of
the
post
i
have
not
ventured
to
do
more
than
hint
at
what
has
come
to
light
during
this
last
year
but
as
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
be
acquainted
with
the
whole
transaction
and
as
you
had
not
decided
when
you
last
wrote
whether
you
would
prosecute
your
intended
three
months
trip
to
sicily
or
return
from
milan
you
may
probably
arrive
when
i
am
out
of
town
i
therefore
enclose
you
a
letter
to
mr
masterton
directing
him
to
surrender
to
you
a
sealed
packet
lodged
in
his
hands
containing
all
the
particulars
the
letters
which
bear
upon
them
and
what
has
been
proposed
to
avoid
exposure
which
you
may
peruse
at
your
leisure
should
you
arrive
before
my
return
to
town
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
the
affair
may
be
hushed
up
and
we
trust
that
you
will
see
the
prudence
of
the
measure
as
once
known
it
will
be
very
discreditable
to
the
family
escutcheon
always
had
an
idea
you
were
of
good
family
interrupted
tim
i
wish
you
had
followed
my
advice
and
had
not
returned
but
as
you
were
positive
on
that
point
i
beg
you
will
now
consider
the
propriety
of
remaining
incognito
as
reports
are
already
abroad
and
your
sudden
return
will
cause
a
great
deal
of
surmise
your
long
absence
at
the
gottingen
university
and
your
subsequent
completion
of
your
grand
tour
will
have
effaced
all
remembrance
of
your
person
and
you
can
easily
be
passed
off
as
a
particular
friend
of
mine
and
i
can
introduce
you
everywhere
as
such
take
then
any
name
you
may
please
provided
it
be
not
smith
or
brown
or
such
vulgarisms
and
on
the
receipt
of
this
letter
write
a
note
and
send
it
to
my
house
in
portman
square
just
saying
and
is
arrived
this
will
prevent
the
servants
from
obtaining
any
information
by
their
prying
curiosity
and
as
i
have
directed
all
my
letters
to
be
forwarded
to
my
seat
in
worcestershire
i
shall
come
up
immediately
that
i
receive
it
and
by
your
putting
the
name
which
you
mean
to
assume
i
shall
know
whom
to
ask
for
when
i
call
at
the
hotel
your
affectionate
uncle
windermear
one
thing
is
very
clear
timothy
said
i
laying
the
letter
on
the
table
that
it
can
not
be
intended
for
me
how
do
you
know
sir
that
this
lord
is
not
your
uncle
at
all
events
you
must
do
as
he
bids
you
what
go
for
the
papers
most
certainly
i
shall
not
then
how
in
the
name
of
fortune
do
you
expect
to
find
your
father
when
you
will
not
take
advantage
of
such
an
opportunity
of
getting
into
society
it
is
by
getting
possession
of
other
people
secrets
that
you
will
worm
out
your
own
but
it
is
dishonest
timothy
a
letter
is
addressed
to
you
in
which
you
have
certain
directions
you
break
the
seal
with
confidence
and
you
read
what
you
find
is
possibly
not
for
you
but
depend
upon
it
japhet
that
a
secret
obtained
is
one
of
the
surest
roads
to
promotion
recollect
your
position
cut
off
from
the
world
you
have
to
yourself
with
it
to
recover
your
footing
and
create
an
interest
you
have
not
those
who
love
you
to
help
you
you
must
not
scruple
to
obtain
your
object
by
fear
that
is
a
melancholy
truth
tim
replied
i
and
i
believe
i
must
put
my
strict
morality
in
my
pocket
do
sir
pray
until
you
can
afford
to
be
moral
it
a
very
expensive
virtue
that
a
deficiency
of
it
made
you
an
outcast
from
the
world
you
must
not
scruple
at
a
slight
deficiency
on
your
own
part
to
regain
your
position
there
was
so
much
shrewdness
so
much
of
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
in
the
remarks
of
timothy
that
added
to
my
ardent
desire
to
discover
my
father
which
since
my
quitting
the
gipsy
camp
had
returned
upon
me
with
twofold
force
my
scruples
were
overcome
and
i
resolved
that
i
would
not
lose
such
an
opportunity
still
i
hesitated
and
went
up
into
my
room
that
i
might
reflect
upon
what
i
should
do
i
went
to
bed
revolving
the
matter
in
my
mind
and
turning
over
from
one
position
to
the
other
at
one
time
deciding
that
i
would
not
take
advantage
of
the
mistake
at
another
quite
as
resolved
that
i
would
not
throw
away
such
an
opening
for
the
prosecution
of
my
search
at
last
i
fell
into
an
uneasy
slumber
and
had
a
strange
dream
i
thought
that
i
was
standing
upon
an
isolated
rock
with
the
waters
raging
around
me
the
tide
was
rising
and
at
last
the
waves
were
roaring
at
my
feet
i
was
in
a
state
of
agony
and
expected
that
in
a
short
time
i
should
be
swallowed
up
the
main
land
was
not
far
off
and
i
perceived
people
in
crowds
who
were
enjoying
themselves
feasting
dancing
and
laughing
in
merry
peals
i
held
out
my
hands
i
shouted
to
them
they
saw
and
heard
me
but
heeded
me
not
my
horror
at
being
swept
away
by
the
tide
was
dreadful
i
shrieked
as
the
water
rose
at
last
i
perceived
something
unroll
itself
from
the
main
land
and
gradually
advancing
to
the
inland
formed
a
bridge
by
which
i
could
walk
over
and
be
saved
i
was
about
to
hasten
over
when
private
and
no
thoroughfare
appeared
at
the
end
nearest
me
in
large
letters
of
fire
i
started
back
with
amazement
and
would
not
dared
not
pass
them
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
figure
in
white
appeared
by
my
side
and
said
to
me
pointing
to
the
bridge
is
the
first
law
of
nature
i
looked
at
the
person
who
addressed
me
gradually
the
figure
became
darker
and
darker
until
it
changed
to
mr
cophagus
with
his
stick
up
to
his
nose
japhet
all
nonsense
very
good
bridge
um
walk
over
find
father
and
so
on
i
dashed
over
the
bridge
which
appeared
to
float
on
the
water
and
to
be
composed
of
paper
gained
the
other
side
and
was
received
with
shouts
of
congratulation
and
the
embraces
of
the
crowd
i
perceived
an
elderly
gentleman
come
forward
i
knew
it
was
my
father
and
i
threw
myself
into
his
arms
i
awoke
and
found
myself
rolling
on
the
floor
embracing
the
bolster
with
all
my
might
such
was
the
vivid
impression
of
this
dream
that
i
could
not
turn
my
thoughts
away
from
it
and
at
last
i
considered
that
it
was
a
divine
interposition
all
my
scruples
vanished
and
before
the
day
had
dawned
i
determined
that
i
would
follow
the
advice
of
timothy
an
enthusiast
is
easily
led
to
believe
what
he
wishes
and
he
mistakes
his
own
feelings
for
warnings
the
dreams
arising
from
his
daily
contemplations
for
the
interference
of
heaven
he
thinks
himself
armed
by
supernatural
assistance
and
warranted
by
the
almighty
to
pursue
his
course
even
if
that
course
should
be
contrary
to
the
almighty
precepts
thus
was
i
led
away
by
my
own
imaginings
and
thus
was
my
increased
to
an
impetus
which
forced
before
it
all
consideration
of
what
was
right
or
wrong
part
one
chapter
nineteen
an
important
chapter
i
make
some
important
acquaintances
obtain
some
important
papers
which
i
am
importunate
to
read
through
the
next
morning
i
told
my
dream
to
timothy
who
laughed
very
heartily
at
my
idea
of
the
finger
of
providence
at
last
perceiving
that
i
was
angry
with
him
he
pretended
to
be
convinced
when
i
had
finished
my
breakfast
i
sent
to
inquire
the
number
in
the
square
of
lord
windermear
town
house
and
wrote
the
following
simple
note
to
his
lordship
has
arrived
from
his
tour
at
the
piazza
covent
garden
this
was
confided
to
timothy
and
i
then
set
off
with
the
other
letter
to
mr
masterton
which
was
addressed
to
lincoln
inn
by
reading
the
addresses
of
the
several
legal
gentlemen
i
found
out
that
mr
masterton
was
located
on
the
first
floor
i
rang
the
bell
which
had
the
effect
of
open
sesame
as
the
door
appeared
to
swing
to
adroit
me
without
any
assistance
i
entered
an
and
from
thence
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
mr
masterton
a
little
old
man
with
spectacles
on
his
nose
sitting
at
a
table
covered
with
papers
he
offered
me
a
chair
and
i
presented
the
letter
i
see
that
i
am
addressing
mr
neville
said
he
after
he
had
perused
the
letter
i
congratulate
you
on
your
return
you
may
not
perhaps
remember
me
indeed
sir
i
can
not
say
that
i
do
exactly
i
could
not
expect
it
my
dear
sir
you
have
been
so
long
away
you
have
very
much
improved
in
person
i
must
say
yet
still
i
recollect
your
features
as
a
mere
boy
without
compliment
i
had
no
idea
that
you
would
ever
have
made
so
handsome
a
man
i
bowed
to
the
compliment
have
you
heard
from
your
uncle
i
had
a
few
lines
from
lord
windermear
enclosing
your
letter
he
is
well
i
hope
quite
well
i
believe
mr
masterton
then
rose
went
to
an
iron
safe
and
brought
out
a
packet
of
papers
which
he
put
into
my
hands
you
will
read
these
with
interest
mr
neville
i
am
a
party
to
the
whole
transaction
and
must
venture
to
advise
you
not
to
appear
in
england
under
your
own
name
until
all
is
settled
your
uncle
i
perceive
has
begged
the
same
and
i
have
assented
sir
i
have
taken
a
name
instead
of
my
real
one
may
i
ask
what
it
is
i
call
myself
mr
japhet
newland
well
it
is
singular
but
perhaps
as
good
as
any
other
i
will
take
it
down
in
case
i
have
to
write
to
you
your
address
is
piazza
covent
garden
mr
masterton
took
my
name
and
address
i
took
the
papers
and
then
we
both
took
leave
of
one
another
with
many
expressions
of
pleasure
and
i
returned
to
the
hotel
where
i
found
timothy
waiting
for
me
with
impatience
japhet
said
he
lord
windermear
has
not
yet
left
town
i
have
seen
him
for
i
was
called
back
after
i
left
the
house
by
the
footman
who
ran
after
me
he
will
be
here
immediately
indeed
replied
i
pray
what
sort
of
person
is
he
and
what
did
he
say
to
you
he
sent
for
me
in
the
where
he
was
at
breakfast
asked
when
you
arrived
whether
you
were
well
and
how
long
i
had
been
in
your
service
i
replied
that
i
had
not
been
more
than
two
days
and
had
just
put
on
my
liveries
he
then
desired
me
to
tell
mr
newland
that
he
would
call
upon
him
in
about
two
hours
my
lord
replied
i
had
better
go
and
tell
him
to
get
out
of
bed
the
lazy
dog
said
he
nearly
one
and
not
out
of
bed
well
go
then
and
get
him
dressed
as
fast
as
you
can
shortly
afterwards
a
handsome
carriage
with
greys
drew
up
to
the
door
his
lordship
sent
in
his
footman
to
ask
whether
mr
newland
was
at
home
the
reply
of
the
waiter
was
that
there
was
a
young
gentleman
who
had
been
there
two
or
three
days
who
had
come
from
making
a
tour
and
his
name
did
begin
with
an
that
will
do
james
let
down
the
steps
his
lordship
alighted
was
ushered
up
stairs
and
into
my
room
there
we
stood
staring
at
each
other
lord
windermear
i
believe
said
i
extending
my
hand
you
have
recognised
me
first
john
said
he
taking
my
hand
and
looking
earnestly
in
my
face
good
heavens
is
it
possible
that
an
awkward
boy
should
have
grown
up
into
so
handsome
a
fellow
i
shall
be
proud
of
any
nephew
did
you
remember
me
when
i
entered
the
room
to
tell
the
truth
my
lord
i
did
not
but
expecting
you
i
took
it
for
granted
that
it
must
be
you
nine
years
make
a
great
difference
john
but
i
forget
i
must
now
call
you
japhet
have
you
been
reading
the
bible
lately
that
you
fixed
upon
that
strange
name
no
my
lord
but
this
hotel
is
such
a
noah
ark
that
it
no
wonder
i
thought
of
it
you
an
undutiful
dog
not
to
ask
after
your
mother
sir
i
was
about
i
see
i
see
interrupted
his
lordship
but
recollect
john
that
she
still
is
have
you
read
the
papers
yet
no
sir
replied
i
there
they
are
pointing
to
them
on
the
side
table
i
really
do
not
like
to
break
the
seals
that
they
will
not
contain
pleasant
intelligence
i
admit
replied
his
lordship
but
until
you
have
read
them
i
do
not
wish
to
converse
with
you
on
the
subject
therefore
said
he
taking
up
the
packet
and
breaking
the
seals
i
must
now
insist
that
you
employ
this
forenoon
in
reading
them
through
you
will
dine
with
me
at
seven
and
then
we
will
talk
the
matter
over
certainly
sir
if
you
wish
it
i
will
read
them
i
must
upon
it
john
and
am
rather
surprised
at
your
objecting
when
they
concern
you
so
particularly
i
shall
obey
your
orders
sir
well
then
my
boy
i
shall
wish
you
good
morning
that
you
may
complete
your
task
before
you
come
to
dinner
if
you
wish
it
but
recollect
i
never
press
young
men
on
these
points
as
i
am
aware
that
they
sometimes
feel
it
a
restraint
if
you
wish
it
i
say
you
may
bring
your
portmanteaus
and
take
up
your
quarters
with
me
continued
his
lordship
taking
hold
of
my
coat
who
made
this
the
tailor
to
his
serene
highness
the
prince
of
darmstadt
had
that
honour
my
lord
replied
i
humph
i
thought
they
fitted
better
in
germany
it
not
quite
the
thing
we
must
consult
stulz
for
with
that
figure
and
face
the
coat
ought
to
be
quite
correct
adieu
my
dear
fellow
till
seven
his
lordship
shook
hands
with
me
and
i
was
left
alone
timothy
came
in
as
soon
as
his
lordship
carriage
had
driven
off
well
sir
said
he
was
your
uncle
glad
to
see
you
yes
replied
i
and
look
he
has
broken
open
the
seals
and
has
insisted
upon
my
reading
the
papers
it
would
be
very
undutiful
in
you
to
refuse
so
i
had
better
leave
you
to
your
task
said
timothy
smiling
as
he
quitted
the
room
part
one
chapter
twenty
i
open
an
account
with
my
bankers
draw
largely
upon
credulity
and
am
prosperous
without
a
check
i
sat
down
and
took
up
the
papers
i
was
immediately
and
strangely
interested
in
all
that
i
read
a
secret
it
was
indeed
a
secret
involving
the
honour
and
reputation
of
the
most
distinguished
families
one
that
if
known
the
trumpet
of
scandal
would
have
blazoned
forth
to
the
disgrace
of
the
aristocracy
it
would
have
occasioned
bitter
tears
to
some
gratified
the
petty
malice
of
many
satisfied
the
revenge
of
the
vindictive
and
bowed
with
shame
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
it
is
not
necessary
nor
indeed
would
i
on
any
account
state
any
more
i
finished
the
last
paper
and
then
fell
into
a
reverie
this
is
indeed
a
secret
thought
i
one
that
i
would
i
never
had
possessed
in
a
despotic
country
my
life
would
be
sacrificed
to
the
fatal
knowledge
here
thank
god
my
life
as
well
as
my
liberty
are
safe
the
contents
of
the
papers
told
me
all
that
was
necessary
to
enable
me
to
support
the
character
which
i
had
assumed
the
reason
why
the
party
whom
i
was
supposed
to
be
was
intrusted
with
it
was
that
he
was
in
a
direct
line
eventually
heir
and
the
question
was
whether
he
would
waive
his
claim
with
the
others
and
allow
death
to
bury
crime
in
oblivion
i
felt
that
were
i
in
his
position
i
should
so
do
and
therefore
was
prepared
to
give
an
answer
to
his
lordship
i
sealed
up
the
papers
dressed
myself
and
went
to
dinner
and
after
the
cloth
was
removed
lord
windermear
first
rising
and
turning
the
key
in
the
door
said
to
me
in
a
low
voice
you
have
read
the
papers
and
what
those
nearly
as
much
interested
as
you
are
in
this
lamentable
business
have
decided
upon
tell
me
what
is
your
opinion
my
opinion
my
lord
is
that
i
wish
i
had
never
known
what
has
come
to
light
this
day
that
it
will
be
most
advisable
never
to
recur
to
the
subject
and
that
the
proposals
made
are
in
my
opinion
most
judicious
and
should
be
acted
upon
that
is
well
replied
his
lordship
then
all
are
agreed
and
i
am
proud
to
find
you
possessed
of
such
honour
and
good
feeling
we
now
drop
the
subject
for
ever
are
you
inclined
to
leave
town
with
me
or
what
do
you
intend
to
do
i
prefer
remaining
in
town
if
your
lordship
will
introduce
me
to
some
of
the
families
of
your
acquaintance
of
course
i
know
no
one
now
very
true
i
will
introduce
you
as
agreed
as
mr
newland
it
may
be
as
well
that
you
do
not
know
any
of
our
relations
whom
i
have
made
to
suppose
that
you
are
still
abroad
and
it
would
be
awkward
when
you
take
your
right
name
do
you
mean
to
see
your
mother
impossible
my
lord
at
present
i
hope
to
be
able
perhaps
it
all
for
the
best
i
will
now
write
one
note
to
major
carbonnell
introducing
you
as
my
particular
friend
and
requesting
that
he
will
make
london
agreeable
he
knows
everybody
and
will
take
you
everywhere
when
does
your
lordship
start
for
the
country
so
we
may
as
well
part
you
have
credit
at
drummond
in
the
name
of
newland
for
a
thousand
pounds
the
longer
you
make
it
last
you
the
better
his
lordship
gave
me
the
letter
of
introduction
i
returned
to
him
the
sealed
packet
shook
hands
with
him
and
took
my
departure
well
sir
said
timothy
rubbing
his
hands
as
he
stood
before
me
what
is
the
news
for
i
am
dying
to
hear
it
and
what
is
this
secret
with
regard
to
the
secret
tim
a
secret
it
must
remain
i
dare
not
tell
it
even
to
you
timothy
looked
rather
grave
at
this
reply
no
timothy
as
a
man
of
honour
i
can
not
my
conscience
smote
me
when
i
made
use
of
the
term
for
as
a
man
of
honour
i
had
no
business
to
be
in
possession
of
it
my
dear
timothy
i
have
done
wrong
already
do
not
ask
me
to
do
worse
i
will
not
japhet
but
only
tell
me
what
has
passed
and
what
you
intend
to
do
that
i
will
timothy
with
pleasure
and
i
then
stated
all
that
had
passed
between
his
lordship
and
me
and
now
you
observe
timothy
i
have
gained
what
i
desired
an
introduction
into
the
best
society
and
the
means
of
keeping
up
your
appearance
echoed
timothy
rubbing
his
hands
a
thousand
pounds
will
last
a
long
while
it
will
last
a
very
long
while
tim
for
i
never
will
touch
it
it
would
be
swindling
so
it
would
replied
tim
his
countenance
falling
well
i
never
thought
of
that
i
have
thought
of
much
more
tim
recollect
i
must
in
a
very
short
time
be
exposed
to
lord
windermear
for
the
real
mr
neville
will
soon
come
home
good
heavens
what
will
become
of
us
replied
timothy
with
alarm
in
his
countenance
nothing
can
hurt
you
tim
the
anger
will
be
all
upon
me
but
i
am
prepared
to
face
it
and
i
would
face
twice
as
much
for
the
distant
hope
of
finding
my
father
whatever
lord
windermear
may
feel
inclined
to
do
he
can
do
nothing
and
my
possession
of
the
secret
will
insure
even
more
than
my
safety
it
will
afford
me
his
protection
if
i
demand
it
i
hope
it
may
prove
so
replied
timothy
but
i
feel
a
little
frightened
i
do
not
i
shall
give
my
letter
of
introduction
and
then
i
will
prosecute
my
search
so
now
my
dear
tim
good
night
the
next
morning
i
lost
no
time
in
presenting
my
letter
of
introduction
to
major
carbonnell
he
lived
in
apartments
on
the
first
floor
in
saint
james
street
and
i
found
him
at
breakfast
in
a
silk
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
a
little
independence
always
carries
with
it
an
air
of
fashion
when
i
entered
therefore
i
looked
at
him
with
a
knowing
air
and
dropping
the
letter
down
on
the
table
before
him
said
there
something
for
you
to
read
major
and
in
the
mean
time
refresh
myself
on
this
chair
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
i
threw
myself
on
a
chair
amusing
myself
with
tapping
the
sides
of
my
boots
with
a
small
cane
which
i
carried
in
my
hand
major
carbonnell
upon
whom
i
cast
a
furtive
eye
more
than
once
during
the
time
that
he
was
reading
the
letter
was
a
person
of
about
years
of
age
but
disfigured
by
the
size
of
his
whiskers
which
advanced
to
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
met
under
his
throat
he
was
tall
and
well
made
and
with
an
air
of
fashion
about
him
that
was
undeniable
his
linen
was
beautifully
clean
and
carefully
arranged
and
he
had
as
many
rings
on
his
fingers
and
when
he
was
dressed
chains
and
trinkets
as
ever
were
put
on
by
a
lady
my
dear
sir
allow
me
the
honour
of
making
at
once
your
most
intimate
acquaintance
said
he
rising
from
his
chair
and
offering
his
hand
as
soon
as
he
had
perused
the
letter
any
friend
of
lord
would
be
welcome
but
when
he
brings
such
an
extra
recommendation
in
his
own
appearance
he
becomes
doubly
so
major
carbonnell
replied
i
i
have
seen
you
but
two
minutes
and
i
have
taken
a
particular
fancy
to
you
in
which
i
no
doubt
have
proved
my
discrimination
of
course
you
know
that
i
have
just
returned
from
making
a
tour
so
i
understand
from
his
lordship
letter
mr
newland
my
time
is
at
your
service
where
are
you
staying
at
the
piazza
very
good
i
will
dine
with
you
order
some
mulligatawny
they
are
famous
for
it
after
dinner
we
will
go
to
the
theatre
i
was
rather
surprised
at
his
cool
manner
of
asking
himself
to
dine
with
me
and
ordering
my
dinner
but
a
moment
reflection
made
me
feel
what
sort
of
person
i
had
to
deal
with
major
i
take
that
as
almost
an
affront
you
will
dine
with
me
i
beg
to
state
that
you
dine
with
me
every
day
that
we
are
not
invited
elsewhere
and
what
more
sir
i
shall
be
most
seriously
displeased
if
you
do
not
order
the
dinner
every
time
that
you
do
dine
with
me
and
ask
whoever
you
may
think
worthy
of
putting
their
legs
under
our
table
let
have
no
doing
things
by
halves
major
i
know
you
now
as
well
as
if
we
had
been
intimate
for
ten
years
the
major
seized
me
by
the
hand
my
dear
newland
i
only
wish
we
had
known
one
another
ten
years
as
you
say
the
loss
has
been
mine
but
now
you
have
breakfasted
i
presume
yes
having
nothing
to
do
and
not
knowing
a
soul
after
my
long
absence
i
advanced
my
breakfast
about
two
hours
that
i
might
find
you
at
home
and
now
i
at
your
service
say
rather
i
am
at
yours
i
presume
you
will
walk
in
ten
minutes
i
shall
be
ready
either
take
up
the
paper
or
whistle
an
air
or
two
or
anything
else
you
like
just
to
kill
ten
minutes
and
i
shall
be
at
your
command
part
one
chapter
twenty
one
i
come
out
under
a
chaperon
and
at
once
am
established
into
the
regions
of
fashion
prove
that
i
am
deserving
of
my
promotion
i
beg
your
pardon
newland
said
the
major
returning
from
his
resplendent
with
chains
and
bijouterie
but
i
must
have
your
christian
name
it
rather
a
strange
one
replied
i
it
is
japhet
japhet
by
the
immortal
powers
i
bring
an
action
against
my
godfathers
and
godmothers
you
ought
to
recover
heavy
damages
then
i
presume
you
would
not
have
the
name
replied
i
with
a
knowing
look
for
a
clear
ten
thousand
a
year
whew
that
alters
the
case
it
astonishing
how
well
any
name
looks
in
large
letters
well
as
the
old
gentleman
whoever
he
might
have
been
made
you
compensation
you
must
forgive
and
forget
now
where
shall
we
go
with
your
permission
as
i
came
to
town
in
these
clothes
made
by
a
german
tailor
darmstadt
tailor
but
still
if
tailor
to
a
prince
not
the
prince
of
tailors
i
would
wish
you
to
take
me
to
your
own
your
dress
appears
very
correct
you
show
your
judgment
newland
it
correct
stulz
will
be
delighted
to
have
your
name
on
his
books
and
to
do
justice
to
that
figure
we
sauntered
up
saint
james
street
and
before
i
had
arrived
at
stulz
i
had
been
introduced
to
at
least
twenty
of
the
young
men
about
town
the
major
was
most
particular
in
his
directions
about
the
clothes
all
of
which
he
ordered
and
as
i
knew
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
fashion
i
gave
him
when
we
left
the
shop
he
said
now
my
dear
newland
i
have
given
you
a
proof
of
friendship
which
no
other
man
in
england
has
had
your
dress
will
be
the
plus
there
are
little
secrets
only
known
to
the
initiated
and
stulz
is
aware
that
this
time
i
am
in
earnest
i
am
often
asked
to
do
the
same
for
others
and
i
pretend
so
to
do
but
a
wink
from
me
is
sufficient
and
stulz
dares
not
dress
them
do
you
want
some
bijouterie
or
have
you
any
at
home
i
may
as
well
have
a
few
trifles
replied
i
we
entered
a
celebrated
jeweller
and
he
selected
for
me
to
the
amount
of
about
forty
pounds
that
will
do
never
buy
much
for
it
is
necessary
to
change
every
three
months
at
least
what
is
the
price
of
this
chain
it
is
only
fifteen
guineas
major
well
i
shall
take
it
but
recollect
continued
the
major
i
tell
you
honestly
i
never
shall
pay
you
the
jeweller
smiled
bowed
and
laughed
the
major
threw
the
chain
round
his
neck
and
we
quitted
the
shop
at
all
events
major
they
appear
not
to
believe
your
word
in
that
shop
my
dear
fellow
that
their
own
fault
not
mine
i
tell
them
honestly
i
never
will
pay
them
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
i
intend
most
sacredly
to
keep
my
word
i
never
do
pay
anybody
for
the
best
of
all
possible
reasons
i
have
no
money
but
then
i
do
them
a
service
i
make
them
fashionable
and
they
know
it
what
debts
do
you
pay
then
major
let
me
think
that
requires
consideration
oh
i
pay
my
washerwoman
do
you
pay
your
debts
of
honour
debts
of
honour
why
i
tell
you
the
truth
for
i
know
that
we
shall
hunt
in
couples
if
i
win
i
take
the
money
but
if
i
lose
why
then
i
forget
to
pay
and
i
always
tell
them
so
before
i
sit
down
to
the
table
if
they
wo
believe
me
it
not
my
fault
but
what
the
hour
come
i
must
make
a
few
calls
and
will
introduce
you
we
sauntered
on
to
grosvenor
square
knocked
and
were
admitted
into
a
large
mansion
the
footman
announced
us
my
dear
lady
maelstrom
allow
me
the
honour
of
introducing
to
you
my
very
particular
friend
mr
newland
consigned
to
my
charge
by
my
lord
windermear
during
his
absence
he
has
just
arrived
from
the
continent
where
he
has
been
making
the
grand
tour
her
ladyship
honoured
me
with
a
smile
major
that
reminds
me
do
me
the
favour
to
come
to
the
window
excuse
us
one
moment
mr
newland
the
major
and
lady
maelstrom
walked
to
the
window
and
exchanged
a
few
sentences
and
then
returned
her
ladyship
holding
up
her
finger
and
saying
to
him
as
they
came
towards
me
promise
me
now
that
you
forget
your
ladyship
slightest
wishes
are
to
me
imperative
commands
replied
the
major
with
a
graceful
bow
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
during
which
the
conversation
was
animated
we
rose
to
take
our
leave
when
her
ladyship
came
up
to
me
and
offering
her
hand
said
mr
newland
the
friendship
of
lord
windermear
and
the
introduction
of
major
carbonnell
are
more
than
sufficient
to
induce
me
to
put
your
name
down
on
my
visiting
list
i
trust
i
shall
see
a
great
deal
of
you
and
that
we
shall
be
great
friends
i
bowed
to
this
handsome
announcement
and
we
retired
as
soon
as
we
were
out
in
the
square
the
major
observed
you
saw
her
take
me
on
one
side
it
was
to
she
has
no
daughters
but
about
fifty
nieces
and
is
her
delight
i
told
her
that
i
would
stake
my
honour
upon
your
possessing
ten
thousand
a
year
how
much
more
i
could
not
say
i
was
not
far
wrong
was
i
i
laughed
what
i
may
be
worth
major
i
really
can
not
say
but
i
trust
that
the
event
will
prove
that
you
are
not
far
wrong
say
no
more
my
dear
fellow
i
understand
you
are
not
yet
of
age
of
course
have
not
yet
come
into
possession
of
your
fortune
that
is
exactly
the
case
major
i
am
now
but
little
more
than
nineteen
you
look
older
but
there
is
no
getting
over
baptismal
registries
with
the
executors
newland
you
must
content
yourself
for
the
two
next
years
in
playing
moses
and
only
peep
at
the
promised
land
we
made
two
or
three
more
calls
and
then
returned
to
saint
street
where
shall
we
go
now
do
you
want
to
go
to
your
banker
i
will
just
stroll
down
with
you
and
see
if
they
have
paid
any
money
in
replied
i
carelessly
we
called
at
drummond
and
i
asked
them
if
there
was
any
money
paid
into
the
credit
of
mr
newland
yes
sir
replied
one
of
the
clerks
there
is
one
thousand
pounds
paid
in
yesterday
very
good
replied
i
how
much
do
you
wish
to
draw
for
inquired
the
major
i
do
want
any
replied
i
i
have
more
money
than
i
ought
to
have
in
my
desk
at
this
moment
well
then
let
us
go
and
order
dinner
or
perhaps
you
would
like
to
stroll
about
a
little
more
if
so
i
will
go
and
order
the
dinner
here
harcourt
that
lucky
harcourt
my
dear
fellow
know
mr
newland
my
very
particular
friend
i
must
leave
you
now
take
his
arm
harcourt
for
half
an
hour
and
then
join
us
at
dinner
at
the
piazza
mr
harcourt
was
an
elegant
young
man
of
about
equally
pleased
with
each
other
externals
we
were
soon
familiar
he
was
witty
sarcastic
and
well
bred
after
half
an
hour
conversation
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
major
i
looked
him
in
the
face
and
smiled
that
look
tells
me
that
you
will
not
be
his
dupe
otherwise
i
had
warned
you
he
is
a
strange
character
but
if
you
have
money
enough
to
afford
to
keep
him
you
can
not
do
better
as
he
is
acquainted
with
and
received
by
everybody
his
connections
are
good
and
he
once
had
a
very
handsome
fortune
but
it
was
soon
run
out
and
he
was
obliged
to
sell
his
commission
in
the
guards
now
he
lives
upon
the
world
which
as
shakspeare
says
is
his
oyster
and
he
has
wit
and
sharpness
enough
to
open
it
moreover
he
has
some
chance
of
falling
into
a
peerage
that
prospect
and
his
amusing
qualities
added
to
his
being
the
most
fashionable
man
about
town
keeps
his
head
above
water
i
believe
lord
windermear
who
is
his
cousin
very
often
helps
him
it
was
lord
windermear
who
introduced
me
to
him
observed
i
then
he
will
not
venture
to
play
any
tricks
upon
you
further
than
eating
your
dinners
borrowing
your
money
and
forgetting
to
pay
it
you
must
acknowledge
said
i
he
always
tells
you
beforehand
that
he
never
will
pay
you
and
that
is
the
only
point
in
which
he
adheres
to
his
word
replied
harcourt
laughing
but
tell
me
am
i
to
be
your
guest
if
you
will
do
me
that
honour
i
assure
you
i
am
delighted
to
come
as
i
shall
have
a
further
opportunity
of
cultivating
your
acquaintance
then
we
had
better
bend
our
steps
towards
the
hotel
for
it
is
late
replied
i
and
we
did
so
accordingly
part
one
chapter
twenty
two
the
real
simon
pure
proves
the
worse
of
the
two
i
am
found
guilty
but
not
condemned
convicted
yet
convince
and
after
having
behaved
the
very
contrary
to
prove
that
i
am
a
gentleman
on
our
arrival
we
found
the
table
spread
champagne
in
ice
under
the
sideboard
and
apparently
everything
prepared
for
a
sumptuous
dinner
the
major
on
the
sofa
giving
directions
to
the
waiter
and
timothy
looking
all
astonishment
major
said
i
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
your
kindness
in
taking
all
this
trouble
off
my
hands
that
i
might
follow
up
the
agreeable
introduction
you
have
given
me
to
mr
harcourt
my
dear
newland
say
no
more
you
will
i
dare
say
do
the
same
for
me
if
i
require
it
when
i
give
a
dinner
harcourt
caught
my
eye
as
if
to
say
may
safely
promise
that
but
newland
do
you
know
that
the
nephew
of
lord
windermear
has
just
arrived
did
you
meet
abroad
no
replied
i
somewhat
confused
but
i
soon
recovered
myself
as
for
tim
he
bolted
out
of
the
room
what
sort
of
a
person
is
he
that
you
may
judge
for
yourself
my
dear
fellow
for
i
asked
him
to
join
us
i
must
say
more
out
of
compliment
to
lord
windermear
than
anything
else
for
i
am
afraid
that
even
i
could
never
make
a
gentleman
of
him
but
take
harcourt
with
you
to
your
room
and
by
the
time
you
have
washed
your
hands
i
will
have
dinner
on
the
table
i
took
the
liberty
of
desiring
your
valet
to
show
me
in
about
ten
minutes
ago
he
a
shrewd
fellow
that
of
yours
where
did
you
pick
him
up
by
mere
accident
replied
i
come
mr
harcourt
on
our
return
we
found
the
real
simon
pure
mr
estcourt
sitting
with
the
major
who
introduced
us
and
dinner
being
served
we
sat
down
to
table
mr
estcourt
was
a
young
man
about
my
own
age
but
not
so
tall
by
two
or
three
inches
his
features
were
prominent
but
harsh
and
when
i
saw
him
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
lord
windermear
expressions
of
satisfaction
when
he
supposed
that
i
was
his
nephew
his
countenance
was
dogged
and
sullen
and
he
spoke
little
he
appeared
to
place
an
immense
value
upon
birth
and
hardly
deigned
to
listen
except
the
aristocracy
were
the
subject
of
discourse
i
treated
him
with
marked
deference
that
i
might
form
an
acquaintance
and
found
before
we
parted
that
night
that
i
had
succeeded
our
dinner
was
excellent
and
we
were
all
except
mr
estcourt
in
high
good
humour
we
sat
late
too
late
to
go
to
the
theatre
and
promising
to
meet
the
next
day
at
noon
harcourt
and
the
major
took
their
leave
mr
estcourt
had
indulged
rather
too
much
and
after
their
departure
became
communicative
i
plied
the
bottle
and
we
sat
up
for
more
than
an
hour
he
talked
of
nothing
but
his
family
and
his
expectations
i
took
this
opportunity
of
discovering
what
his
feelings
were
likely
to
be
when
he
was
made
acquainted
with
the
important
secret
which
was
in
my
possession
i
put
a
case
somewhat
similar
and
asked
him
whether
in
such
circumstances
he
would
waive
his
right
for
a
time
to
save
the
honour
of
his
family
no
by
gad
replied
he
i
never
would
what
give
up
even
for
a
day
my
right
conceal
my
true
rank
for
the
sake
of
relatives
never
nothing
would
induce
me
i
was
satisfied
and
then
casually
asked
him
if
he
had
written
to
lord
windermear
to
inform
him
of
his
arrival
no
replied
he
i
shall
write
he
soon
after
retired
to
his
own
apartment
and
i
rang
for
timothy
good
heavens
sir
cried
timothy
what
is
all
this
and
what
are
you
about
i
am
frightened
out
of
my
wits
why
sir
our
money
will
not
last
two
months
i
do
not
expect
it
will
last
much
longer
tim
but
it
can
not
be
helped
into
society
i
must
get
and
to
do
so
must
pay
for
it
but
sir
putting
the
expense
aside
what
are
we
to
do
about
this
mr
estcourt
all
must
be
found
out
i
intend
that
it
shall
be
found
out
tim
replied
i
but
not
yet
he
will
write
to
his
uncle
you
must
obtain
the
letter
for
it
must
not
go
i
must
first
have
time
to
establish
myself
and
then
lord
windermear
may
find
out
his
error
as
soon
as
he
pleases
upon
my
honour
japhet
you
appear
to
be
afraid
of
nothing
i
fear
nothing
tim
when
i
am
following
up
the
object
of
my
wishes
i
will
allow
no
obstacles
to
stand
in
my
way
in
my
search
after
my
father
really
you
seem
to
be
quite
mad
on
that
point
japhet
perhaps
i
may
be
tim
replied
i
thoughtfully
at
all
events
let
us
go
to
bed
now
and
i
will
tell
you
morning
all
the
events
of
this
day
mr
estcourt
wrote
his
letter
which
tim
very
officiously
offered
to
put
into
the
post
instead
of
which
we
put
it
between
the
bars
of
the
grate
i
must
now
pass
over
about
three
weeks
during
which
i
became
very
intimate
with
the
major
and
mr
harcourt
and
was
introduced
by
them
to
the
clubs
and
almost
every
person
of
fashion
the
idea
of
my
wealth
and
my
very
handsome
person
and
figure
insured
me
a
warm
reception
and
i
soon
became
one
of
the
stars
of
the
day
during
this
time
i
also
gained
the
entire
confidence
of
mr
estcourt
who
put
letter
after
letter
into
the
hands
of
timothy
who
of
course
put
them
into
the
usual
place
i
pacified
him
as
long
as
i
could
by
expressing
my
opinion
that
his
lordship
was
on
a
visit
to
some
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
seat
but
at
last
he
would
remain
in
town
no
longer
you
may
go
now
thought
i
i
feel
quite
safe
it
was
about
five
days
after
his
departure
as
i
was
sauntering
arm
and
arm
with
the
major
who
generally
dined
with
me
about
five
days
in
the
week
that
i
perceived
the
carriage
of
lord
windermear
with
his
lordship
in
it
he
saw
us
and
pulling
his
alighted
and
coming
up
to
us
with
the
colour
mounting
to
his
forehead
with
emotion
returned
the
salute
of
the
major
and
me
major
said
he
you
will
excuse
me
but
i
am
anxious
to
have
some
conversation
with
mr
newland
perhaps
continued
his
lordship
addressing
me
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
take
a
seat
in
my
carriage
fully
prepared
i
lost
none
of
my
but
thanking
his
lordship
i
bowed
to
him
and
stepped
in
his
lordship
followed
and
saying
to
the
footman
home
drive
fast
fell
back
in
the
carriage
and
never
uttered
one
word
until
we
had
arrived
and
had
entered
the
he
then
took
a
few
steps
up
and
down
before
he
said
mr
newland
or
whatever
your
name
may
be
i
perceive
that
you
consider
the
possession
of
an
important
secret
to
be
your
safeguard
to
state
my
opinion
of
your
conduct
is
needless
who
you
are
and
what
you
are
i
know
not
but
continued
he
no
longer
controlling
his
anger
you
certainly
can
have
no
pretensions
to
the
character
of
a
gentleman
perhaps
your
lordship
replied
i
calmly
will
inform
me
upon
what
you
may
ground
your
inference
did
you
not
in
the
first
place
open
a
letter
addressed
to
another
my
lord
i
opened
a
letter
brought
to
me
with
the
initials
of
my
name
and
at
the
time
i
opened
it
i
fully
believed
that
it
was
intended
for
me
we
will
grant
that
sir
but
after
you
had
opened
it
you
must
have
known
that
it
was
for
some
other
person
i
will
not
deny
that
my
lord
notwithstanding
which
you
apply
to
my
lawyer
representing
yourself
as
another
person
to
obtain
sealed
papers
i
did
my
lord
but
allow
me
to
say
that
i
never
should
have
done
so
had
i
not
been
warned
by
a
dream
by
a
dream
yes
my
lord
i
had
determined
not
to
go
for
them
when
in
a
dream
i
was
ordered
so
to
do
paltry
excuse
and
then
you
break
private
seals
nay
my
lord
although
i
did
go
for
the
papers
i
could
not
even
with
the
idea
of
supernatural
interposition
make
up
my
mind
to
break
the
seals
if
your
lordship
will
recollect
it
was
you
who
broke
the
seals
and
insisted
upon
my
reading
the
papers
yes
sir
under
your
false
name
it
is
the
name
by
which
i
go
at
present
although
i
acknowledge
it
is
false
but
that
is
not
my
fault
i
have
no
other
at
present
it
is
very
true
sir
that
in
all
i
have
now
mentioned
the
law
will
not
reach
you
but
recollect
that
by
assuming
another
person
name
i
never
did
my
lord
interrupted
i
well
i
may
say
by
inducing
me
to
believe
that
you
were
my
nephew
you
have
obtained
money
under
false
pretences
and
for
that
i
now
have
you
in
my
power
my
lord
i
never
asked
you
for
the
money
you
yourself
paid
it
into
the
banker
hands
to
my
credit
and
to
my
own
name
i
appeal
to
you
now
whether
if
you
so
deceived
yourself
the
law
can
reach
me
mr
newland
i
will
say
that
much
as
i
regret
what
has
passed
i
regret
more
than
all
the
rest
that
one
so
young
so
prepossessing
so
candid
in
appearance
should
prove
such
an
adept
in
deceit
thinking
you
were
my
nephew
my
heart
warmed
towards
you
and
i
must
confess
that
since
i
have
seen
my
real
nephew
the
mortification
has
been
very
great
my
lord
i
thank
you
but
allow
me
to
observe
that
i
am
no
swindler
your
thousand
pounds
you
will
find
safe
in
the
bank
for
penury
would
not
have
induced
me
to
touch
it
but
now
that
your
lordship
appears
more
cool
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
listen
to
me
when
you
have
heard
my
life
up
to
the
present
and
my
motives
for
what
i
have
done
you
will
then
decide
how
far
i
am
to
blame
his
lordship
took
a
chair
and
motioned
to
me
to
take
another
i
narrated
what
had
occurred
when
i
was
left
at
the
foundling
and
gave
him
a
succinct
account
of
my
adventures
subsequently
my
determination
to
find
my
father
the
dream
which
induced
me
to
go
for
the
papers
and
all
that
the
reader
has
already
been
acquainted
with
his
lordship
evidently
perceived
the
monomania
which
controlled
me
and
heard
me
with
great
attention
you
certainly
mr
newland
do
not
stand
so
low
in
my
opinion
as
you
did
before
this
explanation
and
i
must
make
allowances
for
the
excitement
under
which
i
perceive
you
to
labour
on
one
subject
but
now
sir
allow
me
to
put
one
question
and
i
beg
that
you
will
answer
candidly
what
price
do
you
demand
for
your
secrecy
on
this
important
subject
my
lord
replied
i
rising
with
dignity
this
is
the
greatest
affront
you
have
put
upon
me
yet
still
i
will
name
the
price
by
which
i
will
solemnly
bind
myself
by
all
my
future
hopes
of
finding
my
father
in
this
world
and
of
finding
an
eternal
father
in
the
next
and
that
price
my
lord
is
a
return
of
your
good
opinion
his
lordship
also
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
much
agitation
in
his
manner
what
am
i
to
make
of
you
mr
newland
my
lord
if
i
were
a
swindler
i
should
have
taken
your
money
if
i
had
wished
to
avail
myself
of
the
secret
i
might
have
escaped
with
all
the
documents
and
made
my
own
terms
i
am
my
lord
nothing
more
than
an
abandoned
child
trying
all
he
can
to
find
his
father
my
feelings
overpowered
me
and
i
burst
into
tears
as
soon
as
i
could
recover
myself
i
addressed
his
lordship
who
had
been
watching
me
in
silence
and
not
without
emotion
i
have
one
thing
more
to
say
to
you
my
lord
i
then
mentioned
the
conversation
between
mr
estcourt
and
myself
and
pointed
out
the
propriety
of
not
making
him
a
party
to
the
important
secret
his
lordship
allowed
me
to
proceed
without
interruption
and
after
a
few
moments
thought
said
i
believe
that
you
are
right
mr
newland
and
i
now
begin
to
think
that
it
was
better
that
this
secret
should
have
been
intrusted
to
you
than
to
him
you
have
now
conferred
an
obligation
on
me
and
may
command
me
i
believe
you
to
be
honest
but
a
little
mad
and
i
beg
your
pardon
for
the
pain
which
i
have
occasioned
you
my
lord
i
am
more
than
satisfied
can
i
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
mr
newland
if
my
lord
you
could
at
all
assist
me
or
direct
me
in
my
search
there
i
am
afraid
i
can
be
of
little
use
but
i
will
give
you
the
means
of
prosecuting
your
search
and
in
so
doing
i
am
doing
but
an
act
of
justice
for
in
introducing
you
to
major
carbonnell
i
am
aware
that
i
must
have
very
much
increased
your
expenses
it
was
an
error
which
must
be
repaired
and
therefore
mr
newland
i
beg
you
will
consider
the
money
at
the
bank
as
yours
and
make
use
of
it
to
enable
you
to
obtain
your
ardent
wish
my
lord
i
will
not
be
denied
mr
newland
and
if
you
feel
any
delicacy
on
the
subject
you
may
take
it
as
a
loan
to
be
repaid
when
you
find
it
convenient
do
not
for
a
moment
consider
that
it
is
given
to
you
because
you
possess
an
important
secret
for
i
will
trust
entirely
to
your
honour
on
that
score
indeed
my
lord
replied
i
your
kindness
overwhelms
me
and
i
feel
as
if
in
you
i
had
already
found
a
father
excuse
me
my
lord
but
did
your
lordship
ever
ever
i
know
what
you
would
say
my
poor
fellow
no
i
never
did
i
never
was
blessed
with
children
had
i
been
i
should
not
have
felt
that
i
was
disgraced
by
having
one
resembling
you
allow
me
to
entreat
you
mr
newland
that
you
do
not
suffer
the
mystery
of
your
birth
to
weigh
so
heavily
on
your
mind
and
now
i
wish
you
good
morning
and
if
you
think
i
can
be
useful
to
you
i
beg
that
you
will
not
fail
to
let
me
know
may
heaven
pour
down
blessings
on
your
head
replied
i
kissing
respectfully
his
lordship
hand
and
may
my
father
when
i
find
him
be
as
like
unto
you
as
possible
i
made
my
obeisance
and
quitted
the
house
part
one
chapter
twenty
three
the
major
prevents
the
landlord
from
imposing
on
me
but
i
gain
nothing
by
his
interference
for
economical
reasons
i
agree
to
live
with
him
that
he
may
live
on
me
i
returned
to
the
hotel
for
my
mind
had
been
much
agitated
and
i
wished
for
quiet
and
the
friendship
of
timothy
as
soon
as
i
arrived
i
told
him
all
that
had
passed
indeed
replied
timothy
things
do
now
wear
a
pleasant
aspect
for
i
am
afraid
that
without
that
thousand
we
could
not
have
carried
on
for
a
fortnight
longer
the
bill
here
is
very
heavy
and
i
sure
the
landlord
wishes
to
see
the
colour
of
his
money
how
much
do
you
think
we
have
left
it
is
high
time
timothy
that
we
now
make
up
our
accounts
and
arrange
some
plans
for
the
future
replied
i
i
have
paid
the
jeweller
and
the
tailor
by
the
advice
of
the
major
who
says
that
you
should
always
pay
your
as
soon
as
possible
and
all
your
subsequent
bills
as
late
as
possible
and
if
put
off
so
much
the
better
in
fact
i
owe
very
little
now
but
the
bill
here
i
will
send
for
it
here
we
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
landlord
o
mr
wallace
you
are
the
very
person
i
wished
to
see
let
me
have
my
bill
if
you
please
it
not
of
the
least
consequence
sir
replied
he
but
if
you
wish
it
i
have
posted
down
to
yesterday
and
the
landlord
left
the
room
you
were
both
of
one
mind
at
all
events
said
timothy
laughing
for
he
had
the
bill
in
his
hand
and
concealed
it
the
moment
you
asked
for
it
in
about
ten
minutes
the
landlord
and
presenting
the
bill
upon
a
salver
made
his
bow
and
retired
i
looked
it
over
it
amounted
to
pounds
which
for
little
more
than
three
weeks
was
pretty
well
timothy
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
while
i
ran
over
the
items
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
anything
to
complain
of
tim
observed
i
when
i
came
to
the
bottom
of
it
but
i
do
see
that
living
here
with
the
major
keeping
me
an
open
house
will
never
do
let
us
see
how
much
money
we
have
left
tim
brought
the
in
which
our
cash
was
deposited
and
we
found
that
after
paying
the
waiters
and
a
few
small
bills
not
yet
liquidated
our
whole
stock
was
reduced
to
fifty
shillings
merciful
heaven
what
an
escape
cried
timothy
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
new
supply
what
should
we
have
done
very
badly
timothy
but
the
money
is
well
spent
after
all
i
have
now
entrance
into
the
first
circles
i
can
do
without
major
carbonnell
at
all
events
i
shall
quit
this
hotel
and
take
furnished
apartments
and
live
at
the
clubs
i
know
how
to
put
him
off
i
laid
the
money
on
the
salver
and
desired
timothy
to
ring
for
the
landlord
when
who
should
come
up
but
the
major
and
harcourt
why
newland
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
money
said
the
major
i
am
paying
my
bill
major
paying
your
bill
indeed
let
us
see
pounds
o
this
is
a
confounded
imposition
you
must
pay
this
at
this
moment
the
landlord
entered
mr
wallace
said
the
major
my
friend
mr
newland
was
about
as
you
may
see
to
pay
you
the
whole
of
your
demand
but
allow
me
to
observe
that
being
my
very
particular
friend
and
the
piazza
having
been
particularly
recommended
by
me
i
do
think
that
your
charges
are
somewhat
exorbitant
i
shall
certainly
advise
mr
newland
to
leave
the
house
if
you
are
not
more
reasonable
allow
me
to
observe
major
that
my
reason
for
sending
for
my
bill
was
to
pay
it
before
i
went
into
the
country
which
i
must
do
for
a
few
days
then
i
shall
certainly
recommend
mr
newland
not
to
come
here
when
he
returns
mr
wallace
for
i
hold
myself
to
a
certain
degree
after
the
many
dinners
we
have
ordered
here
and
of
which
i
have
partaken
as
i
may
say
or
in
other
words
as
having
been
a
party
to
this
extortion
indeed
mr
wallace
some
reduction
must
be
made
or
you
will
greatly
hurt
the
credit
of
your
house
mr
wallace
declared
that
really
he
had
made
nothing
but
the
usual
charges
that
he
would
look
over
the
bill
again
and
see
what
he
could
do
my
dear
newland
said
the
major
i
have
ordered
your
dinners
allow
me
to
settle
your
bill
now
mr
wallace
suppose
we
take
off
major
carbonnell
i
should
be
a
loser
i
am
not
exactly
of
your
opinion
but
let
me
see
now
take
your
choice
take
off
pounds
or
you
lose
my
patronage
and
that
of
all
my
friends
yes
or
no
the
landlord
with
some
expostulation
at
last
consented
he
receipted
the
bill
and
leaving
pounds
of
the
money
on
the
salver
made
his
bow
and
retired
rather
fortunate
that
i
slipped
in
my
dear
newland
now
there
are
pounds
saved
i
short
of
cash
you
no
objection
to
let
me
have
this
i
shall
never
pay
you
you
know
i
do
know
you
will
pay
me
major
nevertheless
as
i
should
have
paid
it
to
the
landlord
had
you
not
interfered
i
will
lend
it
to
you
you
are
a
good
fellow
newland
said
the
major
pocketing
the
money
if
i
had
borrowed
it
and
you
had
thought
you
would
have
had
it
repaid
i
should
not
have
thanked
you
but
as
you
lend
it
me
with
your
eyes
open
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
very
delicate
manner
of
obliging
me
and
i
tell
you
candidly
that
i
will
not
forget
it
so
you
really
are
off
yes
replied
i
i
must
go
for
i
find
that
i
am
not
to
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
my
money
until
i
come
into
possession
of
my
property
i
see
my
dear
fellow
executors
are
the
very
devil
they
have
no
feeling
never
mind
there
a
way
of
getting
to
windward
of
them
i
dine
with
harcourt
and
he
has
come
to
ask
you
to
join
us
with
pleasure
i
shall
expect
you
at
seven
newland
said
harcourt
as
he
quitted
the
room
with
the
major
dear
me
sir
how
could
you
let
that
gentleman
walk
off
with
your
money
cried
timothy
i
was
just
rubbing
my
hands
with
the
idea
that
we
were
pounds
better
off
than
we
thought
and
away
it
went
like
smoke
and
will
never
come
back
again
tim
but
never
mind
that
it
is
important
that
i
make
a
friend
of
him
and
his
friendship
is
only
to
be
bought
i
shall
have
value
received
and
now
tim
we
must
pack
up
for
i
leave
this
morning
i
shall
go
down
to
and
see
little
fleta
i
dined
with
harcourt
the
major
was
rather
curious
to
know
what
it
was
which
appeared
to
flurry
lord
windermear
and
what
had
passed
between
us
i
told
him
that
his
lordship
was
displeased
on
money
matters
but
that
all
was
right
only
that
i
must
be
more
careful
for
the
future
indeed
major
i
think
i
shall
take
lodgings
i
shall
be
more
comfortable
and
better
able
to
receive
my
friends
harcourt
agreed
with
me
that
it
was
a
much
better
plan
when
the
major
observed
why
newland
i
have
a
room
quite
at
your
service
suppose
you
come
and
live
with
me
i
am
afraid
i
shall
not
save
by
that
replied
i
laughing
for
you
will
not
pay
your
share
of
the
bills
no
upon
my
honour
i
will
not
so
i
give
you
fair
warning
but
as
i
always
dine
with
you
when
i
do
not
dine
elsewhere
it
will
be
a
saving
to
you
for
you
will
your
newland
and
you
know
the
house
is
my
own
and
i
let
off
the
rest
of
it
so
as
far
as
that
bill
is
concerned
you
will
be
safe
make
the
best
bargain
you
can
newland
said
harcourt
accept
his
offer
for
depend
upon
it
it
will
be
saving
in
the
end
it
certainly
deserves
consideration
replied
i
and
the
company
must
be
allowed
to
have
its
due
weight
in
the
scale
if
carbonnell
will
promise
to
be
a
little
more
economical
i
will
my
dear
fellow
i
will
act
as
your
steward
and
make
your
money
last
as
long
as
i
can
for
my
as
well
as
yours
is
it
a
bargain
i
have
plenty
of
room
for
your
servant
and
if
he
will
assist
me
a
little
i
will
discharge
my
own
i
then
consented
to
the
arrangement
part
one
chapter
twenty
four
the
major
teaches
us
how
to
play
whist
so
as
never
to
lose
which
is
by
playing
against
each
other
and
into
each
other
hands
the
next
day
i
went
to
the
banker
drew
out
pounds
and
set
off
with
timothy
for
fleta
threw
herself
into
my
arms
and
sobbed
with
joy
when
i
told
her
timothy
was
outside
and
wished
to
see
her
she
asked
why
he
did
not
come
in
and
to
show
how
much
she
had
been
accustomed
to
see
without
making
remarks
when
he
made
his
appearance
in
his
livery
she
did
not
by
her
countenance
express
the
least
surprise
nor
indeed
did
she
put
any
questions
to
me
on
the
subject
the
lady
who
kept
the
school
praised
her
very
much
for
docility
and
attention
and
shortly
after
left
the
room
fleta
then
took
the
chain
from
around
her
neck
into
her
hand
and
told
me
that
she
did
recollect
something
about
it
which
was
that
the
lady
whom
she
remembered
wore
a
long
pair
of
of
the
same
make
and
materials
she
could
not
however
call
to
mind
anything
else
i
remained
with
the
little
girl
for
three
hours
and
then
returned
to
london
taking
my
luggage
from
the
hotel
and
installed
myself
into
the
apartments
of
major
carbonnell
the
major
adhered
to
his
promise
we
certainly
lived
well
for
he
could
not
live
otherwise
but
in
every
other
point
he
was
very
careful
not
to
add
to
expense
the
season
was
now
over
and
everybody
of
consequence
quitted
the
metropolis
to
remain
in
town
would
be
to
lose
caste
and
we
had
a
conference
where
we
should
proceed
newland
said
the
major
you
have
created
a
sensation
this
season
which
has
done
great
honour
to
my
patronage
but
i
trust
next
spring
that
i
shall
see
you
form
a
good
alliance
for
believe
me
out
of
the
many
heartless
beings
we
have
mingled
with
there
are
still
not
only
daughters
but
mothers
who
are
not
influenced
by
base
and
sordid
views
why
carbonnell
i
never
heard
you
venture
upon
so
long
a
moral
speech
before
true
newland
and
it
may
be
a
long
while
before
i
do
so
again
the
world
is
my
oyster
which
i
must
open
that
i
may
live
but
recollect
i
am
only
trying
to
recover
my
own
which
the
world
has
swindled
me
out
of
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
even
more
disinterested
more
confiding
and
more
innocent
than
you
were
when
i
first
took
you
in
hand
i
suffered
and
was
ruined
by
my
good
qualities
and
i
now
live
and
do
well
by
having
discarded
them
we
must
fight
the
world
with
its
own
weapons
but
still
as
i
said
before
there
is
some
good
in
it
some
pure
ore
amongst
the
dross
and
it
is
possible
to
find
high
rank
and
large
fortune
and
at
the
same
time
an
innocent
mind
if
you
do
marry
i
will
try
hard
but
you
shall
possess
both
not
that
fortune
can
be
of
much
consequence
to
you
depend
upon
it
carbonnell
i
never
will
marry
without
fortune
i
did
not
know
that
i
had
schooled
you
so
well
be
it
so
it
is
but
fair
that
you
should
expect
it
and
it
shall
be
an
item
in
the
match
if
i
have
anything
to
do
with
it
but
why
are
you
so
anxious
that
i
should
marry
carbonnell
because
i
think
you
will
in
all
probability
avoid
the
which
i
should
have
taken
you
to
myself
had
you
been
in
possession
of
your
fortune
when
i
first
knew
you
and
have
had
my
share
of
your
plucking
but
now
i
do
know
you
i
have
that
affection
for
you
that
i
think
it
better
you
should
not
lose
your
all
for
observe
newland
my
share
of
your
spoliation
would
not
be
more
than
what
i
have
and
may
still
receive
from
you
and
if
you
marry
and
settle
down
there
will
always
be
a
good
house
and
a
good
table
for
me
as
long
as
i
find
favour
with
your
wife
and
at
all
events
a
friend
in
need
that
i
feel
convinced
of
so
now
you
have
my
reasons
some
smack
of
the
disinterestedness
of
former
days
others
of
my
present
worldliness
you
may
believe
which
you
please
and
the
major
laughed
as
he
finished
his
speech
carbonnell
replied
i
i
will
believe
that
the
better
feelings
predominate
that
the
world
has
made
you
what
you
are
and
that
had
you
not
been
ruined
by
the
world
you
would
have
been
disinterested
and
generous
even
now
your
real
nature
often
gains
the
ascendency
and
i
am
sure
that
in
all
that
you
have
done
which
is
not
defensible
your
poverty
and
not
your
will
has
consented
now
blunted
by
habit
and
time
the
suggestions
of
conscience
do
not
often
give
you
any
uneasiness
you
are
very
right
my
dear
fellow
replied
the
major
and
in
having
a
better
opinion
of
me
than
the
world
in
general
you
do
me
i
trust
no
more
than
justice
i
will
not
squander
fortune
when
you
come
to
it
if
i
can
help
it
and
you
allow
that
a
very
handsome
promise
on
my
part
i
defy
you
to
squander
my
fortune
replied
i
laughing
nay
do
defy
me
newland
for
if
you
do
you
put
me
on
my
mettle
above
all
do
lay
me
a
bet
for
that
will
be
still
more
dangerous
we
have
only
spent
about
four
hundred
of
the
thousand
since
we
have
lived
together
which
i
consider
highly
economical
what
do
you
say
shall
we
go
to
cheltenham
you
will
find
plenty
of
irish
girls
looking
out
for
husbands
who
will
give
you
a
warm
reception
i
hate
your
fortune
and
establishment
hunters
replied
i
i
grant
that
they
are
looking
out
for
a
good
match
so
are
all
the
world
but
let
me
do
them
justice
although
if
you
proposed
in
three
days
they
would
accept
you
yet
once
married
they
make
the
very
best
wives
in
the
world
but
recollect
we
must
go
somewhere
and
i
think
cheltenham
is
as
good
a
place
as
any
other
i
do
not
mean
for
a
wife
but
it
will
suit
my
own
views
this
last
observation
decided
me
and
in
a
few
days
we
were
at
cheltenham
and
having
made
our
appearance
at
the
rooms
were
soon
in
the
vortex
of
society
newland
said
carbonnell
i
dare
say
you
find
time
hang
rather
heavy
in
this
monotonous
place
not
at
all
replied
i
what
with
dining
out
dancing
and
promenading
i
do
very
well
but
we
must
do
better
tell
me
are
you
a
good
hand
at
whist
not
by
any
means
indeed
i
hardly
know
the
game
it
is
a
fashionable
and
necessary
accomplishment
i
must
make
you
master
of
it
and
our
mornings
shall
be
dedicated
to
the
work
agreed
replied
i
and
from
that
day
every
morning
after
breakfast
till
four
the
major
and
i
were
shut
up
playing
two
dummies
under
his
instruction
adept
as
he
was
i
very
soon
learnt
all
the
finesse
and
beauty
of
the
game
you
will
do
now
newland
said
the
major
one
morning
tossing
the
cards
away
recollect
if
you
are
asked
to
play
and
i
have
agreed
do
not
refuse
but
we
must
always
play
against
each
other
i
do
see
what
we
shall
gain
by
that
replied
i
for
if
i
win
you
lose
never
do
you
mind
that
only
follow
my
injunctions
and
play
as
high
as
they
choose
we
only
stay
here
three
weeks
longer
and
must
make
the
most
of
our
time
i
confess
i
was
quite
puzzled
at
what
might
be
the
major
intentions
but
that
night
we
sauntered
into
the
club
not
having
made
our
appearance
before
we
were
considered
as
new
hands
by
those
who
did
not
know
the
major
and
were
immediately
requested
to
make
up
a
game
upon
my
word
gentlemen
in
the
first
place
i
play
very
badly
replied
the
major
and
in
the
next
continued
he
laughing
if
i
lose
i
never
shall
pay
you
for
i
cleaned
out
the
way
in
which
the
major
said
this
only
excited
a
smile
he
was
not
believed
and
i
was
also
requested
to
take
a
hand
i
not
play
with
the
major
observed
i
for
he
plays
badly
and
has
bad
luck
into
the
bargain
i
might
as
well
lay
my
money
down
on
the
table
this
was
agreed
to
by
the
other
parties
and
we
sat
down
the
first
rubber
of
short
whist
was
won
by
the
major
and
his
partner
with
the
bets
it
amounted
to
eighteen
pounds
i
pulled
out
my
purse
to
pay
the
major
but
he
refused
saying
no
newland
pay
my
partner
and
with
you
sir
said
he
addressing
my
partner
i
will
allow
the
debt
to
remain
until
we
rise
from
the
table
newland
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
off
yet
i
can
tell
you
i
paid
my
eighteen
pounds
and
we
recommenced
although
his
partner
did
not
perhaps
observe
it
for
he
was
but
an
indifferent
player
or
if
he
did
observe
it
had
the
politeness
not
to
say
anything
the
major
now
played
very
badly
he
lost
three
rubbers
one
after
another
and
with
bets
and
stakes
they
amounted
to
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
at
the
end
of
the
last
rubber
he
threw
up
the
cards
exclaiming
against
his
luck
and
declaring
that
he
would
play
no
more
how
are
we
now
sir
said
he
to
my
partner
you
owed
me
i
think
eighteen
pounds
eighteen
from
one
hundred
and
forty
leaves
one
hundred
and
pounds
which
i
now
owe
you
you
must
i
afraid
allow
me
to
be
your
debtor
continued
the
major
in
a
most
insinuating
manner
i
did
not
come
here
with
the
intention
of
playing
i
presume
i
shall
find
you
here
night
the
gentleman
bowed
and
appeared
quite
satisfied
major
partner
paid
me
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
which
i
put
in
my
and
we
quitted
the
club
end
of
the
first
volume
part
two
chapter
one
we
fund
our
winnings
and
consider
to
refund
a
work
of
supererogation
in
looking
after
my
father
i
obey
the
old
adage
follow
your
nose
as
soon
as
we
were
in
the
street
i
commenced
an
inquiry
as
to
the
major
motives
not
one
word
my
dear
fellow
until
we
are
at
home
replied
he
as
soon
as
we
arrived
he
threw
himself
in
a
chair
and
crossing
his
legs
commenced
you
observe
newland
that
i
am
very
careful
that
you
should
do
nothing
to
injure
your
character
as
for
my
own
all
the
honesty
in
the
world
will
not
redeem
it
nothing
but
a
peerage
will
ever
set
me
right
again
in
this
world
and
a
coronet
will
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
i
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
add
something
to
our
finances
and
intend
to
add
very
considerably
to
them
before
we
leave
cheltenham
you
have
won
one
hundred
and
pounds
yes
replied
i
but
you
have
lost
it
granted
but
as
in
most
cases
i
never
mean
to
my
losses
you
see
that
it
must
be
a
winning
speculation
as
long
as
we
play
against
each
other
i
perceive
replied
i
but
am
not
i
a
confederate
no
you
paid
when
you
lost
and
took
your
money
when
you
won
leave
me
to
settle
my
own
debts
of
honour
but
you
will
meet
him
again
night
yes
and
i
will
tell
you
why
i
never
thought
it
possible
that
we
could
have
met
two
such
bad
players
at
the
club
we
must
now
play
against
them
and
we
must
win
in
the
long
run
by
which
means
i
shall
pay
off
the
debt
i
owe
him
and
you
will
win
and
pocket
the
money
ah
replied
i
if
you
mean
to
allow
him
a
chance
for
his
money
i
have
no
objection
that
will
be
all
fair
depend
upon
it
newland
when
i
know
that
people
play
as
badly
as
they
do
i
will
not
refuse
them
but
when
we
sit
down
with
others
it
must
be
as
it
was
before
we
must
play
against
each
other
and
i
shall
the
money
i
told
the
fellow
that
i
never
would
pay
him
yes
but
he
thought
you
were
only
joking
that
is
his
fault
i
was
in
earnest
i
could
not
have
managed
this
had
it
not
been
that
you
are
known
to
be
a
young
man
of
ten
thousand
pounds
per
annum
and
supposed
to
be
my
dupe
i
tell
you
so
candidly
and
now
good
night
i
turned
the
affair
over
in
my
mind
as
i
undressed
it
was
not
honest
but
i
paid
when
i
lost
and
i
only
took
the
money
when
i
won
still
i
did
not
like
it
but
the
bank
notes
caught
my
eye
as
they
lay
on
the
table
and
i
was
satisfied
alas
how
easy
are
scruples
removed
when
we
want
money
how
many
are
there
who
when
in
a
state
of
prosperity
and
affluence
when
not
tried
by
temptation
would
have
blushed
at
the
bare
idea
of
a
dishonest
action
have
raised
and
held
up
their
hands
in
abhorrence
when
they
have
heard
that
others
have
been
found
guilty
and
yet
when
in
adversity
have
themselves
committed
the
very
acts
which
before
they
so
loudly
condemned
how
many
of
the
other
sex
who
have
expressed
their
indignation
and
contempt
at
those
who
have
fallen
when
tempted
have
fallen
themselves
let
us
therefore
be
charitable
none
of
us
can
tell
to
what
we
may
be
reduced
by
circumstances
and
when
we
acknowledge
that
the
error
is
great
let
us
feel
sorrow
and
pity
rather
than
indignation
and
pray
that
we
also
may
not
be
into
as
agreed
upon
the
next
evening
we
repaired
to
the
club
and
found
the
two
gentlemen
ready
to
receive
us
this
time
the
major
refused
to
play
unless
it
was
with
me
as
i
had
such
good
fortune
and
no
difficulty
was
made
by
our
opponents
we
sat
down
and
played
till
four
in
the
morning
at
first
notwithstanding
our
good
play
fortune
favoured
our
adversaries
but
the
luck
soon
changed
and
the
result
of
the
evening
was
that
the
major
had
a
balance
in
his
favour
of
forty
pounds
and
i
rose
a
winner
of
one
hundred
and
pounds
so
that
in
two
nights
we
had
won
three
hundred
and
pounds
for
nearly
three
weeks
this
continued
the
major
not
paying
when
not
convenient
and
we
quitted
cheltenham
with
about
eight
hundred
pounds
in
our
pockets
the
major
having
paid
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
to
different
people
who
frequented
the
club
but
they
were
irishmen
who
were
not
to
be
trifled
with
i
proposed
to
the
major
that
we
should
pay
those
debts
as
there
still
would
be
a
large
surplus
he
replied
give
me
the
money
i
did
so
now
continued
he
so
far
your
scruples
are
removed
as
you
will
have
been
strictly
honest
but
my
dear
fellow
if
you
know
how
many
debts
of
this
sort
are
due
to
me
of
which
i
never
did
touch
one
farthing
you
would
feel
as
i
do
that
it
is
excessively
foolish
to
with
i
have
them
all
booked
here
and
may
some
day
pay
when
convenient
but
at
present
most
decidedly
it
is
not
so
the
major
put
the
notes
into
his
pocket
and
the
conversation
was
dropped
the
next
morning
we
had
ordered
our
horses
when
timothy
came
up
to
me
and
made
a
sign
as
we
were
at
breakfast
for
me
to
come
out
i
followed
him
oh
sir
i
could
not
help
telling
you
but
there
is
a
gentleman
with
with
what
replied
i
hastily
with
your
sir
exactly
and
in
other
respects
very
like
you
just
about
the
age
your
father
should
be
where
is
he
timothy
replied
i
all
my
feelings
in
search
of
my
father
rushing
into
my
mind
down
below
sir
about
to
set
off
in
a
and
four
now
waiting
at
the
door
i
ran
down
with
my
breakfast
napkin
in
my
hand
and
hastened
to
the
portico
of
the
hotel
he
was
in
his
carriage
and
the
porter
was
then
shutting
the
door
i
looked
at
him
he
was
as
timothy
said
me
indeed
the
exact
i
was
breathless
and
i
continued
to
gaze
all
right
cried
the
ostler
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
i
addressing
the
gentleman
in
the
carriage
who
perceiving
a
napkin
in
my
hand
probably
took
me
for
one
of
the
waiters
for
he
replied
very
abruptly
i
have
remembered
you
and
pulling
up
the
glass
away
whirled
the
chariot
the
nave
of
the
hind
wheel
striking
me
a
blow
on
the
thigh
which
numbed
it
so
that
it
was
with
difficulty
i
could
limp
up
to
our
apartments
when
i
threw
myself
on
the
sofa
in
a
state
of
madness
and
despair
good
heavens
newland
what
is
the
matter
cried
the
major
matter
replied
i
faintly
i
have
seen
my
father
your
father
newland
you
must
be
mad
he
was
dead
before
you
could
recollect
him
at
least
so
you
told
me
how
then
even
if
it
were
his
ghost
could
you
have
recognised
him
the
major
remarks
reminded
me
of
the
imprudence
i
had
been
guilty
of
major
replied
i
i
believe
i
am
very
absurd
but
he
was
so
like
me
and
i
have
so
often
longed
after
my
father
so
long
wished
to
see
him
face
to
face
that
i
a
great
fool
that
the
fact
you
must
go
to
the
next
world
my
good
fellow
to
meet
him
face
to
face
that
clear
and
i
presume
upon
a
little
consideration
you
will
feel
inclined
to
postpone
your
journey
very
often
in
your
sleep
i
have
heard
you
talk
about
your
father
and
wondered
why
you
should
think
so
much
about
him
i
can
not
help
it
replied
i
from
my
earliest
days
my
father
has
ever
been
in
my
thoughts
i
can
only
say
that
very
few
sons
are
half
so
dutiful
to
their
fathers
memories
but
finish
your
breakfast
and
then
we
start
for
london
i
complied
with
his
request
as
well
as
i
could
and
we
were
soon
on
our
road
i
fell
into
a
reverie
my
object
was
to
again
find
out
this
person
and
i
quietly
directed
timothy
to
ascertain
from
the
the
directions
he
gave
at
the
last
stage
the
major
perceiving
me
not
inclined
to
talk
made
but
few
observations
one
however
struck
me
windermear
said
he
i
recollect
one
day
when
i
was
praising
you
said
carelessly
you
were
a
fine
young
man
but
a
tete
upon
one
point
i
see
now
it
must
have
been
upon
this
i
made
no
reply
but
it
certainly
was
a
strange
circumstance
that
the
major
never
had
any
suspicions
on
this
point
yet
he
certainly
never
had
we
had
once
or
twice
talked
over
my
affairs
i
had
led
him
to
suppose
that
my
father
and
mother
died
in
my
infancy
and
that
i
should
have
had
a
large
fortune
when
i
came
of
age
but
this
had
been
entirely
by
indirect
replies
not
by
positive
assertions
the
fact
was
that
the
major
who
was
an
adept
in
all
deceit
never
had
an
idea
that
he
could
have
been
deceived
by
one
so
young
so
prepossessing
and
apparently
so
ingenuous
as
myself
he
had
in
fact
deceived
himself
his
ideas
of
my
fortune
arose
entirely
from
my
asking
him
whether
he
would
have
refused
the
name
of
for
ten
thousand
pounds
per
annum
lord
windermear
after
having
introduced
me
did
not
consider
it
at
all
necessary
to
acquaint
the
major
with
my
real
history
as
it
was
imparted
to
him
in
confidence
he
allowed
matters
to
take
their
course
and
me
to
work
my
own
way
in
the
world
thus
do
the
most
cunning
overreach
themselves
and
with
their
eyes
open
to
any
deceit
on
the
part
of
others
prove
quite
blind
when
they
deceive
themselves
timothy
could
not
obtain
any
intelligence
from
the
people
of
the
inn
at
the
last
stage
except
that
the
chariot
had
proceeded
to
london
we
arrived
late
at
night
and
much
exhausted
i
was
glad
to
go
to
bed
part
two
chapter
two
in
following
my
nose
i
narrowly
escaped
being
nosed
by
a
beak
and
as
i
lay
in
my
bed
thinking
that
i
was
now
nearly
twenty
years
old
and
had
not
yet
made
any
discovery
my
heart
sank
within
me
my
monomania
returned
with
redoubled
force
and
i
resolved
to
renew
my
search
with
vigour
so
i
told
timothy
the
next
morning
when
he
came
into
my
room
but
from
him
i
received
little
consolation
he
advised
me
to
look
out
for
a
good
match
in
a
rich
wife
and
leave
time
to
develop
the
mystery
of
my
birth
pointing
out
the
little
chance
i
ever
had
of
success
town
was
not
full
the
season
had
hardly
commenced
and
we
had
few
invitations
or
visits
to
distract
my
thoughts
from
their
object
my
leg
became
so
painful
that
for
a
week
i
was
on
the
sofa
timothy
every
day
going
out
to
ascertain
if
he
could
find
the
person
whom
we
had
seen
resembling
me
and
every
evening
returning
without
success
i
became
melancholy
and
nervous
carbonnell
could
not
imagine
what
was
the
matter
with
me
at
last
i
was
able
to
walk
and
i
sallied
forth
perambulating
or
rather
running
through
street
after
street
looking
into
every
carriage
so
as
to
occasion
surprise
to
the
occupants
who
believed
me
mad
my
dress
and
person
were
disordered
for
i
had
become
indifferent
to
it
and
timothy
himself
believed
that
i
was
going
out
of
my
senses
at
last
after
we
had
been
in
town
about
five
weeks
i
saw
the
very
object
of
my
search
seated
in
a
carriage
of
a
dark
brown
colour
arms
painted
in
shades
so
as
not
to
be
distinguishable
but
at
a
near
approach
his
hat
was
off
and
he
sat
upright
and
formally
that
is
he
ejaculated
i
and
away
i
ran
after
the
carriage
it
is
the
nose
cried
i
as
i
ran
down
the
street
knocking
everyone
to
the
right
and
left
i
lost
my
hat
but
fearful
of
losing
sight
of
the
carriage
i
hastened
on
when
i
heard
a
cry
of
stop
him
stop
him
stop
him
cried
i
also
referring
to
the
gentleman
in
black
in
the
carriage
that
wo
do
cried
a
man
seizing
me
by
the
collar
i
know
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
let
me
go
roared
i
struggling
but
he
only
held
me
the
faster
i
tussled
with
the
man
until
my
coat
and
shirt
were
torn
but
in
vain
the
crowd
now
assembled
and
i
was
fast
the
fact
was
that
a
pickpocket
had
been
exercising
his
vocation
at
the
time
that
i
was
running
past
and
from
my
haste
and
loss
of
my
hat
i
was
supposed
to
be
the
criminal
the
police
took
charge
of
me
i
pleaded
innocence
in
vain
and
i
was
dragged
before
the
magistrate
at
marlborough
street
my
appearance
the
disorder
of
my
dress
my
coat
and
shirt
in
ribands
with
no
hat
were
certainly
not
at
all
in
my
favour
when
i
made
my
appearance
led
in
by
two
bow
street
officers
whom
have
we
here
inquired
the
magistrate
a
pickpocket
sir
replied
they
ah
one
of
the
swell
mob
replied
he
are
there
any
witnesses
yes
sir
replied
a
young
man
coming
forward
i
was
walking
up
bond
street
when
i
felt
a
tug
at
my
pocket
and
when
i
turned
round
this
chap
was
running
away
can
you
swear
to
his
person
there
were
plenty
to
swear
that
i
was
the
person
who
ran
away
now
sir
have
you
anything
to
offer
in
your
defence
said
the
magistrate
yes
sir
replied
i
i
certainly
was
running
down
the
street
and
it
may
be
for
all
i
know
or
care
that
this
person
pocket
may
have
been
picked
but
i
did
not
pick
it
i
am
a
gentleman
all
your
fraternity
lay
claim
to
gentility
replied
the
magistrate
perhaps
you
will
state
why
you
were
running
down
the
street
i
was
running
after
a
carriage
sir
that
i
might
speak
to
the
person
inside
of
it
pray
who
was
the
person
inside
i
do
not
know
sir
why
should
you
run
after
a
person
you
do
not
know
it
was
because
of
his
his
nose
replied
the
magistrate
angrily
do
you
think
to
trifle
with
me
sir
you
shall
now
follow
your
own
nose
to
prison
make
out
his
committal
as
you
please
sir
replied
i
but
still
i
have
told
you
the
truth
if
you
will
allow
anyone
to
take
a
note
i
will
soon
prove
my
respectability
i
ask
it
in
common
justice
be
it
so
replied
the
magistrate
let
him
sit
down
within
the
bar
till
the
answer
comes
in
less
than
an
hour
my
note
to
major
carbonnell
was
answered
by
his
appearance
in
person
followed
by
timothy
carbonnell
walked
up
to
the
magistrate
while
timothy
asked
the
officers
in
an
angry
tone
what
they
had
been
doing
to
his
this
rather
startled
them
but
both
they
and
the
magistrate
were
much
surprised
when
the
major
asserted
that
i
was
his
most
particular
friend
mr
newland
who
possessed
ten
thousand
pounds
per
annum
and
who
was
as
well
known
in
fashionable
society
as
any
young
man
of
fortune
about
town
the
magistrate
explained
what
had
passed
and
asked
the
major
if
i
was
not
a
little
deranged
but
the
major
who
perceived
what
was
the
cause
of
my
strange
behaviour
told
him
that
somebody
had
insulted
me
and
that
i
was
very
anxious
to
lay
hold
of
the
person
who
had
avoided
me
and
who
must
have
been
in
that
carriage
i
am
afraid
that
after
your
explanation
major
carbonnell
i
must
as
a
magistrate
bind
over
your
friend
mr
newland
to
keep
the
peace
to
this
i
consented
the
major
and
timothy
being
taken
as
recognisances
and
then
i
was
permitted
to
depart
the
major
sent
for
a
and
when
we
were
going
home
he
pointed
out
to
me
the
folly
of
my
conduct
and
received
my
promise
to
be
more
careful
for
the
future
thus
did
this
affair
end
and
for
a
short
time
i
was
more
careful
in
my
appearance
and
not
so
very
anxious
to
look
into
carriages
still
however
the
idea
haunted
me
and
i
was
often
very
melancholy
it
was
about
a
month
afterwards
that
i
was
sauntering
with
the
major
who
now
considered
me
to
be
insane
upon
that
point
and
who
would
seldom
allow
me
to
go
out
without
him
when
i
again
perceived
the
same
carriage
with
the
gentleman
inside
as
before
there
he
is
major
cried
i
there
is
who
replied
he
the
man
so
like
my
father
what
in
that
carriage
that
is
the
bishop
of
e
my
good
fellow
what
a
strange
idea
you
have
in
your
head
newland
it
almost
amounts
to
madness
do
not
be
staring
in
that
way
come
along
still
my
head
was
turned
quite
round
looking
at
the
carriage
after
it
had
passed
till
it
was
out
of
sight
but
i
knew
who
the
party
was
and
for
the
time
i
was
satisfied
as
i
determined
to
find
out
his
address
and
call
upon
him
i
narrated
to
timothy
what
had
occurred
and
referring
to
the
red
book
i
looked
out
the
bishop
town
address
and
the
next
day
after
breakfast
having
arranged
my
toilet
with
the
utmost
precision
i
made
an
excuse
to
the
major
and
set
off
to
portland
place
part
two
chapter
three
a
chapter
of
mistakes
no
benefit
of
clergy
i
attack
a
bishop
and
am
beaten
off
the
major
hedges
upon
the
filly
stakes
my
hand
trembled
as
i
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
opened
i
sent
in
my
card
requesting
the
honour
of
an
audience
with
his
lordship
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
in
an
i
was
ushered
in
my
lord
said
i
in
a
flurried
manner
will
you
allow
me
to
have
a
few
conversation
with
you
alone
this
gentleman
is
my
secretary
sir
but
if
you
wish
it
certainly
for
although
he
is
my
confidant
i
have
no
right
to
insist
that
he
shall
be
yours
mr
temple
will
you
oblige
me
by
going
up
stairs
for
a
little
while
the
secretary
quitted
the
room
the
bishop
pointed
to
a
chair
and
i
sat
down
i
looked
him
earnestly
in
the
face
the
nose
was
exact
and
i
imagined
that
even
in
the
other
features
i
could
distinguish
a
resemblance
i
was
satisfied
that
i
had
at
last
gained
the
object
of
my
search
i
believe
sir
observed
i
that
you
will
acknowledge
that
in
the
heat
and
impetuosity
of
youth
we
often
rush
into
hasty
and
improvident
connections
i
paused
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
his
very
true
my
young
sir
and
when
we
do
we
are
ashamed
and
repent
of
them
afterwards
replied
the
bishop
rather
astonished
i
grant
that
sir
replied
i
but
at
the
same
time
we
must
feel
that
we
must
abide
by
the
results
however
unpleasant
when
we
do
wrong
mr
newland
replied
the
bishop
first
looking
at
my
card
and
then
upon
me
we
find
that
we
are
not
only
to
be
punished
in
the
next
world
but
suffer
for
it
also
in
this
i
trust
you
have
no
reason
for
such
suffering
unfortunately
the
sins
of
the
fathers
are
visited
upon
the
children
and
in
that
view
i
may
say
that
i
have
suffered
my
dear
sir
replied
the
bishop
i
trust
you
will
excuse
me
when
i
say
that
my
time
is
rather
valuable
if
you
have
anything
of
importance
to
communicate
anything
upon
which
you
would
ask
my
advice
for
assistance
you
do
not
appear
to
require
do
me
the
favour
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
point
i
will
sir
be
as
concise
as
the
matter
will
admit
of
allow
me
then
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
and
i
trust
to
your
honour
and
the
dignity
of
your
profession
for
a
candid
answer
did
you
not
marry
a
young
woman
early
in
life
and
were
you
not
very
much
pressed
in
your
circumstances
the
bishop
stared
really
mr
newland
it
is
a
strange
question
and
i
can
not
imagine
to
what
it
may
lead
but
still
i
will
answer
it
i
did
marry
early
in
life
and
i
was
at
that
time
not
in
very
affluent
circumstances
you
had
a
child
by
that
marriage
your
eldest
born
a
boy
that
is
also
true
mr
newland
replied
the
bishop
gravely
how
long
is
it
since
you
have
seen
him
it
is
many
years
replied
the
bishop
putting
his
handkerchief
up
to
his
eyes
answer
me
now
sir
did
you
not
desert
him
no
no
replied
the
bishop
it
is
strange
that
you
should
appear
to
know
so
much
about
the
matter
mr
newland
as
you
could
have
hardly
been
born
i
was
poor
then
very
poor
but
although
i
could
ill
afford
it
he
had
fifty
pounds
from
me
but
sir
replied
i
much
agitated
why
have
you
not
reclaimed
him
i
would
have
reclaimed
him
mr
newland
but
what
could
i
do
he
was
not
to
be
reclaimed
and
now
he
is
lost
for
ever
surely
sir
in
your
present
affluence
you
must
wish
to
see
him
again
he
died
and
i
trust
he
has
gone
to
heaven
replied
the
bishop
covering
up
his
face
no
sir
replied
i
throwing
myself
on
my
knees
before
him
he
did
not
die
here
he
is
at
your
feet
to
ask
your
blessing
the
bishop
sprang
from
his
chair
what
does
this
mean
sir
said
he
with
astonishment
you
my
son
yes
reverend
father
your
son
who
with
fifty
pounds
you
left
on
the
top
of
the
portsmouth
coach
no
sir
in
the
my
son
sir
impossible
he
died
in
the
hospital
no
sir
he
has
come
out
of
the
replied
i
and
as
you
perceive
safe
and
well
either
sir
this
must
be
some
strange
mistake
or
you
must
be
trifling
with
me
replied
his
lordship
for
sir
i
was
at
his
and
followed
him
to
his
grave
are
you
sure
of
that
sir
replied
i
starting
up
with
amazement
i
wish
that
i
was
not
sir
for
i
am
now
childless
but
pray
sir
who
and
what
are
you
who
know
so
much
of
my
former
life
and
who
would
have
thus
imposed
upon
me
imposed
upon
you
sir
replied
i
perceiving
that
i
was
in
error
alas
i
would
do
no
such
thing
am
i
i
am
a
young
man
who
is
in
search
of
his
father
your
face
and
especially
your
nose
so
resembled
mine
that
i
made
sure
that
i
had
succeeded
pity
me
sir
pity
me
continued
i
covering
up
my
face
with
my
hands
the
bishop
perceiving
that
there
was
little
of
the
impostor
in
my
appearance
and
that
i
was
much
affected
allowed
a
short
time
for
me
to
recover
myself
and
then
entered
into
an
explanation
when
a
curate
he
had
had
an
only
son
very
wild
who
would
go
to
sea
in
spite
of
his
remonstrances
he
saw
him
depart
by
the
portsmouth
coach
and
gave
him
the
sum
mentioned
his
son
received
a
mortal
wound
in
action
and
was
sent
to
the
plymouth
hospital
where
he
died
i
then
entered
into
my
explanation
in
a
few
concise
sentences
and
with
a
heart
beating
with
disappointment
took
my
leave
the
bishop
shook
hands
with
me
as
i
quitted
the
room
and
wished
me
better
success
at
my
next
application
i
went
home
almost
in
despair
timothy
consoled
me
as
well
as
he
could
and
advised
me
to
go
as
much
as
possible
into
society
as
the
most
likely
chance
of
obtaining
my
wish
not
that
he
considered
there
was
any
chance
but
he
thought
that
amusement
would
restore
me
to
my
usual
spirits
i
will
go
and
visit
little
fleta
replied
i
for
a
few
days
the
sight
of
her
will
do
me
more
good
than
anything
else
and
the
next
day
i
set
off
for
the
town
of
where
i
found
the
dear
little
girl
much
grown
and
much
improved
i
remained
with
her
for
a
week
walking
with
her
in
the
country
amusing
her
and
amused
myself
with
our
conversation
at
the
close
of
the
week
i
bade
her
farewell
and
returned
to
the
major
lodgings
i
was
astonished
to
find
him
in
deep
mourning
my
dear
carbonnell
said
i
inquiringly
i
hope
no
severe
loss
nay
my
dear
newland
i
should
be
a
hypocrite
if
i
said
so
for
there
never
was
a
more
merry
mourner
and
that
the
truth
of
it
mr
m
who
you
know
stood
between
me
and
the
peerage
has
been
drowned
in
the
rhone
i
now
have
a
squeak
for
it
his
wife
has
one
daughter
and
is
should
the
child
prove
a
boy
i
am
done
for
but
if
a
girl
i
must
then
come
into
the
barony
and
fifteen
thousand
pounds
per
annum
however
i
hedged
pretty
handsomely
how
do
you
mean
why
they
say
that
when
a
woman
commences
with
girls
she
generally
goes
on
and
the
odds
are
two
to
one
that
mrs
m
has
a
girl
i
have
taken
the
odds
at
the
clubs
to
the
amount
of
fifteen
thousand
pounds
so
if
it
be
a
girl
i
shall
have
to
pay
that
out
of
my
fifteen
thousand
pounds
per
annum
as
soon
as
i
fall
into
it
if
it
be
a
boy
and
i
am
floored
i
shall
pocket
thirty
thousand
pounds
by
way
of
consolation
for
the
disappointment
they
are
all
good
men
yes
but
they
know
you
never
pay
they
know
i
never
do
now
because
i
have
no
money
but
they
know
i
will
pay
if
i
come
into
the
estate
and
so
i
will
most
honourably
besides
a
few
more
thousands
that
i
have
in
my
book
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
major
how
old
is
the
present
lord
b
i
have
just
been
examining
the
peerage
he
is
but
he
is
very
fresh
and
hearty
and
may
live
a
long
while
yet
newland
i
committed
a
great
error
last
night
at
the
club
i
played
pretty
high
and
lost
a
great
deal
of
money
that
is
unfortunate
that
was
not
the
error
i
actually
paid
all
my
losings
newland
and
it
has
reduced
the
stock
amazingly
i
lost
seven
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
i
know
i
ought
not
to
have
paid
away
your
money
but
the
fact
was
as
i
was
hedging
it
would
not
do
not
to
have
paid
as
i
could
not
have
made
up
my
book
as
i
wished
it
is
however
only
waiting
a
few
weeks
till
mrs
m
decides
my
fate
and
then
either
one
way
or
the
other
i
shall
have
money
enough
if
your
people
wo
give
you
any
more
till
you
are
of
age
why
we
must
send
to
a
little
friend
of
mine
that
all
and
you
shall
borrow
for
both
of
us
borrow
replied
i
not
much
liking
the
idea
they
will
never
lend
me
money
wo
they
replied
the
major
no
fear
of
that
your
signature
and
my
introduction
will
be
quite
sufficient
we
had
better
try
to
do
without
it
major
i
do
not
much
like
it
well
if
we
can
we
will
but
i
have
not
fifty
pounds
left
in
my
desk
how
much
have
you
about
twenty
replied
i
in
despair
at
this
intelligence
but
i
think
there
is
a
small
sum
left
at
the
banker
i
will
go
and
see
i
took
up
my
hat
and
set
off
to
ascertain
what
funds
we
might
have
in
store
part
two
chapter
four
i
am
over
head
and
ears
in
trouble
about
a
lady
commit
myself
sadly
and
am
very
nearly
committed
i
must
say
that
i
was
much
annoyed
at
this
intelligence
the
would
not
be
satisfied
unless
they
knew
where
my
estates
were
and
had
examined
the
will
at
doctors
commons
then
all
would
be
exposed
to
the
major
and
i
should
be
considered
by
him
as
an
impostor
i
walked
down
pall
mall
in
a
very
unhappy
mood
so
deep
in
thought
that
i
ran
against
a
lady
who
was
stepping
out
of
her
carriage
at
a
fashionable
shop
she
turned
round
and
i
was
making
my
best
apologies
to
a
very
handsome
woman
when
her
caught
my
attention
they
were
of
alternate
coral
and
gold
and
the
facsimile
in
make
to
the
chain
given
by
nattee
to
fleta
during
my
last
visit
i
had
often
had
the
chain
in
my
hand
and
particularly
marked
the
workmanship
to
make
more
sure
i
followed
her
into
the
shop
and
stood
behind
her
carefully
examining
them
as
she
looked
over
a
quantity
of
laces
there
could
be
no
doubt
i
waited
till
the
lady
rose
to
go
away
and
then
addressed
the
shopman
asking
the
lady
name
he
did
not
know
she
was
a
stranger
but
perhaps
mr
h
the
master
did
and
he
went
back
to
answer
the
question
mr
h
being
at
that
moment
busy
the
man
stayed
so
long
that
i
heard
the
carriage
drive
off
fearful
of
losing
sight
of
the
lady
i
took
to
my
heels
and
ran
out
of
the
shop
my
sudden
flight
from
the
counter
covered
with
lace
made
them
imagine
that
i
had
stolen
some
and
they
cried
out
stop
thief
as
loud
as
they
could
springing
over
the
counter
and
pursuing
me
as
i
pursued
the
carriage
which
was
driven
at
a
rapid
pace
a
man
perceiving
me
running
and
others
without
their
hats
following
with
the
cries
of
stop
thief
put
out
his
leg
and
i
fell
on
the
pavement
the
blood
rushing
in
torrents
from
my
nose
i
was
seized
roughly
handled
and
again
handed
over
to
the
police
who
carried
me
before
the
same
magistrate
in
marlborough
street
what
is
this
demanded
the
magistrate
a
shoplifter
you
worship
i
am
not
sir
replied
i
you
know
me
well
enough
i
am
mr
newland
mr
newland
replied
the
magistrate
suspiciously
this
is
strange
a
second
time
to
appear
before
me
upon
such
a
charge
and
just
as
innocent
as
before
sir
you
excuse
me
sir
but
i
must
have
my
suspicions
this
time
where
is
the
evidence
the
people
of
the
shop
then
came
forward
and
stated
what
had
occurred
let
him
be
searched
said
the
magistrate
i
was
searched
but
nothing
was
found
upon
me
are
you
satisfied
now
sir
inquired
i
by
no
means
let
the
people
go
back
and
look
over
their
laces
and
see
if
any
are
missing
in
the
mean
time
i
shall
detain
you
for
it
is
very
easy
to
get
rid
of
a
small
article
such
as
lace
when
you
are
caught
the
men
went
away
and
i
wrote
a
note
to
major
carbonnell
requesting
his
attendance
he
arrived
at
the
same
time
as
the
shopman
and
i
told
him
what
had
happened
the
shopman
declared
that
the
stock
was
not
correct
as
far
as
they
could
judge
there
were
two
pieces
of
lace
missing
if
so
i
did
not
take
them
replied
i
upon
my
honour
mr
b
said
the
major
to
the
magistrate
it
is
very
hard
for
a
gentleman
to
be
treated
in
this
manner
this
is
the
second
time
that
i
have
been
sent
for
to
vouch
for
his
respectability
very
true
sir
replied
the
magistrate
but
allow
me
to
ask
mr
newland
as
he
calls
himself
what
induced
him
to
follow
a
lady
into
the
shop
her
replied
i
her
why
sir
the
last
time
you
were
brought
before
me
you
said
it
was
after
a
gentleman
nose
now
it
appears
you
were
attracted
by
a
lady
ears
and
pray
sir
what
induced
you
to
run
out
of
the
shop
because
i
wanted
particularly
to
inquire
about
her
sir
i
can
not
understand
these
paltry
excuses
there
are
it
appears
two
pieces
of
lace
missing
i
must
remand
you
for
further
examination
sir
and
you
also
sir
said
the
magistrate
to
major
carbonnell
for
if
he
is
a
swindler
you
must
be
an
accomplice
sir
replied
major
carbonnell
sneeringly
you
are
certainly
a
very
good
judge
of
a
gentleman
when
you
happen
by
accident
to
be
in
his
company
with
your
leave
i
will
send
a
note
to
another
confederate
the
major
then
wrote
a
note
to
lord
windermear
which
he
despatched
by
timothy
who
hearing
i
was
in
trouble
had
accompanied
the
major
and
while
he
was
away
the
major
and
i
sat
down
he
giving
himself
all
manner
of
airs
much
to
the
annoyance
of
the
magistrate
who
at
last
threatened
to
commit
him
immediately
you
repent
this
replied
the
major
who
perceived
lord
windermear
coming
in
you
shall
repent
it
sir
by
god
cried
the
magistrate
in
a
great
passion
put
five
shillings
in
the
box
for
swearing
mr
b
you
fine
other
people
said
the
major
here
is
my
other
confederate
lord
windermear
carbonnell
said
lord
windermear
what
is
all
this
nothing
my
lord
except
that
our
friend
newland
is
taken
up
for
shoplifting
because
he
thought
proper
to
run
after
a
pretty
carriage
and
i
am
accused
by
his
worship
of
being
his
confederate
i
could
forgive
his
suspicions
of
mr
newland
in
that
plight
but
as
for
his
taking
me
for
one
of
the
swell
mob
it
proves
a
great
deficiency
of
judgment
perhaps
he
will
commit
your
lordship
also
as
he
may
not
be
aware
that
your
lordship
person
is
above
caption
i
can
assure
you
sir
said
lord
windermear
proudly
that
this
is
my
relative
major
carbonnell
and
the
other
is
my
friend
mr
newland
i
will
bail
them
for
any
sum
you
please
the
magistrate
felt
astonished
and
annoyed
for
after
all
he
had
only
done
his
duty
before
he
could
reply
a
man
came
from
the
shop
to
say
that
the
laces
had
been
found
all
right
lord
windermear
then
took
me
aside
and
i
narrated
what
had
happened
he
recollected
the
story
of
fleta
in
my
narrative
of
my
life
and
felt
that
i
was
right
in
trying
to
find
out
who
the
lady
was
the
magistrate
now
apologised
for
the
detention
but
explained
to
his
lordship
how
i
had
before
made
my
appearance
upon
another
charge
and
with
a
low
bow
we
were
dismissed
my
dear
mr
newland
said
his
lordship
i
trust
that
this
will
be
a
warning
to
you
not
to
run
after
other
people
noses
and
at
the
same
time
i
will
certainly
keep
a
look
out
for
those
very
myself
major
i
wish
you
a
good
morning
his
lordship
then
shook
us
both
by
the
hand
and
saying
that
he
should
be
glad
to
see
more
of
me
than
he
latterly
had
done
stepped
into
his
carriage
and
drove
off
what
the
devil
did
his
lordship
mean
about
newland
inquired
the
major
i
told
him
that
i
was
examining
the
lady
as
very
remarkable
replied
i
you
appear
to
be
able
to
deceive
everybody
but
me
my
good
fellow
i
know
that
you
were
examining
the
lady
herself
i
left
the
major
in
his
error
by
making
no
reply
part
two
chapter
five
i
borrow
money
upon
my
estate
and
upon
very
favourable
terms
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
the
major
said
my
dear
newland
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
requesting
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
to
come
and
meet
you
this
morning
i
will
not
disguise
from
you
that
it
is
emmanuel
the
money
you
must
have
until
my
affairs
are
decided
one
way
or
the
other
and
in
this
instance
i
will
most
faithfully
repay
the
sum
borrowed
as
soon
as
i
receive
the
amount
of
my
bets
or
am
certain
of
succeeding
to
the
title
which
is
one
and
the
same
thing
i
bit
my
lips
for
i
was
not
a
little
annoyed
but
what
could
be
done
i
must
have
either
confessed
my
real
situation
to
the
major
or
have
appeared
to
raise
scruples
which
as
the
supposed
heir
to
a
large
fortune
would
have
appeared
to
him
to
be
very
frivolous
i
thought
it
better
to
let
the
affair
take
its
chance
well
replied
i
if
it
must
be
it
must
be
but
it
shall
be
on
my
own
terms
nay
observed
the
major
there
is
no
fear
but
that
he
will
consent
and
without
any
trouble
after
a
moment
reflection
i
went
up
stairs
and
rang
for
timothy
tim
said
i
hear
me
i
now
make
you
a
solemn
promise
on
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
that
i
will
never
borrow
money
upon
interest
and
until
you
release
me
from
it
i
shall
adhere
to
my
word
very
well
sir
replied
timothy
i
guess
your
reason
for
so
doing
and
i
expect
you
will
keep
your
word
is
that
all
yes
now
you
may
take
up
the
urn
we
had
finished
our
breakfast
when
timothy
announced
mr
emmanuel

mr
major
rather
too
hard
emmanuel
but
de
rishque
de
rishque
mr
major
i
will
not
agree
to
those
terms
replied
i
you
must
take
your
money

mr
emmanuel
vell
den
vat
vill

i
will
sign
an
agreement
to
pay

pounds
for
the
thousand
if
you
please
if
that

i
will
try
elsewhere
dat
is
very
bad
bargain
how
old
you
shay
twenty
vell
i
shuppose
i
must
oblige
you
and
my
very
goot
friend
de
major
mr
emmanuel
drew
out
his
spectacles
pen
and
inkhorn
filled
up
a
bond
and
handed
it
to
me
to
sign
i
read
it
carefully
over
and
signed
it
he
then
paid
down
the
money
and
took
his
leave
it
may
appear
strange
to
the
reader
that
the
money
was
obtained
so
easily
but
he
must
remember
that
the
major
was
considered
a
person
who
universally
attached
himself
to
young
men
of
large
fortune
he
had
already
been
the
means
of
throwing
many
profitable
speculations
into
the
hands
of
emmanuel
and
the
latter
put
implicit
confidence
in
him
the
also
are
always
on
the
look
out
for
young
men
with
large
fortunes
and
have
their
names
registered
emmanuel
had
long
expected
me
to
come
to
him
and
although
it
was
his
intention
to
have
examined
more
particularly
and
not
to
have
had
the
money
prepared
yet
my
refusal
to
sign
the
bond
bearing
interest
and
my
disputing
the
terms
of
the
second
proposal
blinded
him
completely
and
put
him
off
his
usual
guard
upon
my
word
newland
you
obtained
better
terms
than
i
could
have
expected
from
the
old
hunks
much
better
than
i
expected
also
major
replied
i
but
now
how
much
of
the
money
would
you
like
to
have
my
dear
fellow
this
is
very
handsome
of
you
but
i
thank
heaven
i
shall
be
soon
able
to
repay
it
but
what
pleases
me
newland
is
your
perfect
confidence
in
one
whom
the
rest
of
the
world
would
not
trust
with
a
shilling
i
will
accept
your
offer
as
freely
as
it
is
made
and
take
pounds
just
to
make
a
show
for
the
few
weeks
that
i
am
in
suspense
and
then
you
will
find
that
with
all
my
faults
i
am
not
deficient
in
gratitude
i
divided
the
money
with
the
major
and
he
shortly
afterwards
went
out
well
sir
said
timothy
entering
full
of
curiosity
what
have
you
done
i
have
borrowed
a
thousand
to
pay
fifteen
hundred
when
i
come
into
my
property
you
are
safe
then
excellent
and
the
jew
will
be
bit
no
timothy
i
intend
to
repay
it
as
soon
as
i
can
i
should
like
to
know
when
that
will
be
so
should
i
tim
for
it
must
depend
upon
my
finding
out
my
parentage
heigho
thought
i
when
shall
i
ever
find
out
who
is
my
father
part
two
chapter
six
the
major
is
very
fortunate
and
very
unfortunate
he
receives
a
large
sum
in
gold
and
one
ounce
of
lead
i
dressed
and
went
out
met
harcourt
dined
with
him
and
on
my
return
the
major
had
not
come
home
it
was
then
past
midnight
and
feeling
little
inclination
to
sleep
i
remained
in
the
waiting
for
his
arrival
about
three
he
came
in
flushed
in
the
face
and
apparently
in
high
good
humour
newland
said
he
throwing
his
on
the
table
just
open
that
and
then
you
will
open
your
eyes
i
obeyed
him
and
to
my
surprise
took
out
a
bundle
of
bank
notes
i
counted
up
their
value
and
they
amounted
to
pounds
you
have
been
fortunate
indeed
yes
replied
the
major
knowing
that
in
a
short
time
i
shall
be
certain
of
cash
one
way
or
the
other
i
had
resolved
to
try
my
luck
with
the
pounds
i
went
to
the
hazard
table
and
threw
in
seventeen
times
hedged
upon
the
deuce
ace
and
threw
out
with
it
they
wo
catch
me
there
again
in
a
hurry
luck
like
that
only
comes
once
in
a
man
life
but
japhet
there
is
a
little
drawback
to
all
this
i
shall
require
your
kind
attendance
in
two
or
three
hours
why
what
the
matter
merely
an
affair
of
honour
i
was
insulted
by
a
vagabond
and
we
meet
at
six
a
vagabond
but
surely
carbonnell
you
will
not
condescend
my
dear
fellow
although
as
great
a
vagabond
as
there
is
on
the
face
of
the
earth
yet
he
is
a
peer
of
the
realm
and
his
title
warrants
the
meeting
but
after
all
what
is
it
i
trust
it
will
be
nothing
carbonnell
but
still
it
may
prove
otherwise
granted
and
what
then
my
dear
newland
we
all
owe
heaven
a
death
and
if
i
am
floored
why
then
i
shall
no
longer
be
anxious
about
title
or
fortune
it
a
bad
way
of
settling
a
dispute
replied
i
gravely
there
is
no
other
newland
how
would
society
be
held
in
check
if
it
were
not
for
duelling
we
should
all
be
a
set
of
bears
living
in
a
i
presume
you
have
never
been
out
never
replied
i
and
had
hoped
that
i
never
should
have
then
you
must
have
better
fortune
or
better
temper
than
most
others
if
you
pass
through
life
without
an
affair
of
this
kind
on
your
hands
i
mean
as
principal
not
as
second
but
my
dear
fellow
i
must
give
you
a
little
advice
relative
to
your
behaviour
as
a
second
for
very
particular
on
these
occasions
and
like
that
things
should
be
done
very
correctly
it
will
never
do
my
dear
newland
that
you
appear
on
the
ground
with
that
melancholy
face
i
do
not
mean
that
you
should
laugh
or
even
smile
that
would
be
equally
out
of
character
but
you
should
show
yourself
perfectly
calm
and
indifferent
in
your
behaviour
towards
the
other
second
you
must
be
most
scrupulously
polite
but
at
the
same
time
never
give
up
a
point
of
dispute
in
which
my
interest
may
be
concerned
even
in
your
walk
be
slow
and
move
as
much
as
the
ground
will
allow
you
as
if
you
were
in
a
never
remain
silent
offer
even
trivial
remarks
rather
than
appear
there
is
one
point
of
great
importance
i
refer
to
choosing
the
ground
in
which
perhaps
you
will
require
my
unperceived
assistance
any
decided
line
behind
me
would
be
very
advantageous
to
my
adversary
such
as
the
trunk
of
a
tree
post
etcetera
even
an
elevated
light
or
dark
ground
behind
me
is
inadvisable
choose
if
you
can
a
broken
light
as
it
affects
the
correctness
of
the
aim
but
as
you
will
not
probably
be
able
to
manage
this
satisfactorily
i
will
assist
you
when
on
the
ground
after
having
divided
the
sun
fairly
between
us
i
will
walk
about
unconcernedly
and
when
i
perceive
a
judicious
spot
i
will
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
use
my
handkerchief
turning
at
the
same
time
in
the
direction
in
which
i
wish
my
adversary
to
be
placed
take
your
cue
from
that
and
with
all
suavity
of
manner
insist
as
much
as
you
can
upon
our
being
so
placed
that
must
be
left
to
your
own
persuasive
powers
i
believe
i
have
now
stated
all
that
is
necessary
and
i
must
prepare
my
instruments
the
major
then
went
into
his
own
room
and
i
never
felt
more
nervous
or
more
unhinged
than
after
this
conversation
i
had
a
melancholy
foreboding
but
that
i
believe
everyone
has
when
he
for
the
first
time
has
to
assist
at
a
mortal
rencontre
i
was
in
a
deep
musing
when
he
returned
with
his
pistols
and
all
the
necessary
apparatus
and
when
the
major
pointed
out
to
me
and
made
me
once
or
twice
practise
the
setting
of
the
hair
triggers
which
is
the
duty
of
the
second
an
involuntary
shudder
came
over
me
why
newland
what
is
the
matter
with
you
i
thought
that
you
had
more
nerve
i
probably
should
show
more
carbonnell
were
i
the
principal
instead
of
the
second
but
i
can
not
bear
the
reflection
that
some
accident
should
happen
to
you
you
are
the
only
one
with
whom
i
have
been
on
terms
of
friendship
and
the
idea
of
losing
you
is
very
very
painful
newland
you
really
quite
unman
me
and
you
may
now
see
a
miracle
continued
carbonnell
as
he
pressed
his
hand
to
his
eye
the
moisture
of
a
tear
on
the
cheek
of
a
london
a
man
of
the
world
who
has
long
lived
for
himself
and
for
this
world
only
it
never
would
be
credited
if
asserted
newland
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
like
yourself
the
world
took
advantage
of
my
ingenuousness
and
inexperience
my
good
feelings
were
the
cause
of
my
ruin
and
then
by
degrees
i
became
as
callous
and
as
hardened
as
the
world
itself
my
dear
fellow
i
thought
all
affection
all
sentiment
dried
up
within
me
but
it
is
not
the
case
you
have
made
me
feel
that
i
have
still
a
heart
and
that
i
can
love
you
but
this
is
all
romance
and
not
fitted
for
the
present
time
it
is
now
five
let
us
be
on
the
ground
early
it
will
give
us
an
advantage
i
do
not
much
like
speaking
to
you
on
the
subject
carbonnell
but
is
there
nothing
that
you
might
wish
done
in
case
of
accident
nothing
why
yes
i
may
as
well
give
me
a
sheet
of
paper
the
major
sat
down
and
wrote
for
a
few
minutes
now
send
timothy
and
another
here
timothy
and
you
sir
see
me
sign
this
paper
and
put
my
seal
to
it
i
deliver
this
as
my
act
and
deed
put
your
names
as
witnesses
they
complied
with
his
request
and
then
the
major
desired
timothy
to
call
a
newland
said
the
major
putting
the
paper
folded
up
in
my
pocket
along
with
the
bank
notes
take
care
of
this
for
me
till
we
come
back
the
coach
is
at
the
door
sir
said
timothy
looking
at
me
as
if
to
say
what
can
all
this
be
about
you
may
come
with
us
and
see
said
the
major
observing
countenance
and
put
that
case
into
the
coach
tim
who
knew
that
it
was
the
major
case
of
pistols
appeared
still
more
alarmed
and
stood
still
without
obeying
the
order
never
mind
tim
your
master
is
not
the
one
who
is
to
use
them
said
the
major
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
timothy
relieved
by
this
intelligence
went
down
stairs
with
the
pistols
we
followed
him
tim
mounted
on
the
box
and
we
drove
to
chalk
farm
shall
the
coach
wait
inquired
timothy
yes
by
all
means
replied
i
in
a
low
voice
we
arrived
at
the
usual
ground
where
disputes
of
this
kind
were
generally
settled
and
the
major
took
a
survey
of
it
with
great
composure
now
observe
japhet
said
he
if
you
can
contrive
but
here
they
are
i
will
give
you
the
notice
agreed
upon
the
peer
whose
title
was
lord
tineholme
now
came
up
with
his
second
whom
he
introduced
to
me
as
mr
osborn
mr
newland
replied
the
major
saluting
mr
osborn
in
return
we
both
took
off
our
hats
bowed
and
then
proceeded
to
our
duty
i
must
do
my
adversary
second
the
justice
to
say
that
his
politeness
was
fully
equal
to
mine
there
was
no
mention
on
either
side
of
explanations
and
retractions
the
insult
was
too
gross
and
the
character
of
his
lordship
as
well
as
that
of
major
carbonnell
was
too
well
known
twelve
paces
were
proposed
by
mr
osborn
and
agreed
to
by
me
the
pistols
of
major
carbonnell
were
gained
by
drawing
lots
we
had
nothing
more
to
do
but
to
place
our
principals
the
major
took
out
his
took
a
pinch
and
blew
his
nose
turning
towards
a
copse
of
beech
trees
with
your
permission
i
will
mark
out
the
ground
mr
osborn
said
i
walking
up
to
the
major
and
intending
to
pace
twelve
paces
in
the
direction
towards
which
he
faced
allow
me
to
observe
that
i
think
a
little
more
in
this
direction
would
be
more
fair
for
both
parties
said
mr
osborn
it
would
so
my
dear
sir
replied
i
but
submitting
to
your
superior
judgment
perhaps
it
may
not
have
struck
you
that
my
principal
will
have
rather
too
much
of
the
sun
i
am
incapable
of
taking
any
advantage
but
i
should
not
do
my
duty
if
i
did
not
see
every
justice
done
to
the
major
who
has
confided
to
me
in
this
unpleasant
affair
i
put
it
to
you
sir
as
a
gentleman
and
man
of
honour
whether
i
am
claiming
too
much
a
little
amicable
altercation
took
place
on
this
point
but
finding
that
i
would
not
yield
and
that
at
every
reply
i
was
more
and
more
polite
and
bland
in
my
deportment
mr
osborn
gave
up
the
point
i
walked
the
twelve
paces
and
mr
osborn
placed
his
principal
i
observed
that
lord
tineholme
did
not
appear
pleased
he
expostulated
with
him
but
it
was
then
too
late
the
pistols
had
been
already
loaded
the
choice
was
given
to
his
lordship
and
major
carbonnell
received
the
other
from
my
hand
which
actually
trembled
while
his
was
firm
i
requested
mr
osborn
to
drop
the
handkerchief
as
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
give
a
signal
which
might
be
fatal
to
the
major
they
fired
lord
tineholme
fell
immediately
the
major
remained
on
his
feet
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
sank
down
on
the
ground
i
hastened
up
to
him
where
are
you
hurt
the
major
put
his
hand
to
his
hip
i
am
hit
hard
newland
but
not
so
hard
as
he
is
run
and
see
i
left
the
major
and
went
up
to
where
lord
tineholme
lay
his
head
raised
on
the
knee
of
his
second
it
is
all
over
with
him
mr
newland
the
ball
has
passed
through
his
brain
part
two
chapter
seven
the
major
pays
the
only
debt
of
consequence
he
ever
did
pay
and
i
find
myself
a
man
of
property
i
hastened
back
to
the
major
to
examine
his
wound
and
with
the
assistance
of
timothy
i
stripped
him
sufficiently
to
ascertain
that
the
ball
had
entered
his
hip
and
probing
the
wound
with
my
finger
it
appeared
that
it
had
glanced
off
in
the
direction
of
the
intestines
the
suffusion
of
blood
was
very
trifling
which
alarmed
me
still
more
could
you
bear
removal
major
in
the
coach
i
can
not
tell
but
we
must
try
the
sooner
i
am
home
the
better
japhet
replied
he
faintly
with
the
assistance
of
timothy
i
put
him
into
the
and
we
drove
off
after
i
had
taken
off
my
hat
and
made
my
obeisance
to
mr
osborn
an
effort
of
politeness
which
i
certainly
should
have
neglected
had
i
not
been
reminded
of
it
by
my
principal
we
set
off
and
the
major
bore
his
journey
very
well
making
no
complaint
but
on
our
arrival
he
fainted
as
we
lifted
him
out
as
soon
as
he
was
on
the
bed
i
despatched
timothy
for
a
surgeon
on
his
arrival
he
examined
the
wound
and
shook
his
head
taking
me
into
the
next
room
he
declared
his
opinion
that
the
ball
had
passed
into
the
intestines
which
were
severed
and
that
there
was
no
hope
i
sat
down
and
covered
up
my
face
the
tears
rolled
down
and
trickled
through
my
fingers
it
was
the
first
heavy
blow
i
had
yet
received
without
kindred
or
connections
i
felt
that
i
was
about
to
lose
one
who
was
dear
to
me
to
another
not
in
my
situation
it
might
have
only
produced
a
temporary
grief
at
the
near
loss
of
a
friend
but
to
me
who
was
almost
alone
in
the
world
the
loss
was
heavy
in
the
extreme
whom
had
i
to
fly
to
for
solace
there
were
timothy
and
fleta
one
who
performed
the
duty
of
a
servant
to
me
and
a
child
i
felt
that
they
were
not
sufficient
and
my
heart
was
chilled
the
surgeon
had
in
the
mean
time
returned
to
the
major
and
dressed
the
wound
the
major
who
had
recovered
from
his
weakness
asked
him
his
candid
opinion
we
must
hope
for
the
best
sir
replied
the
surgeon
that
is
to
say
there
is
no
hope
replied
the
major
and
i
feel
that
you
are
right
how
long
do
you
think
that
i
may
live
if
the
wound
does
not
take
a
favourable
turn
about
hours
sir
replied
the
surgeon
but
we
must
hope
for
a
more
fortunate
issue
in
a
case
you
medical
men
are
like
lawyers
replied
the
major
there
is
no
getting
a
straightforward
answer
from
you
where
is
mr
newland
here
i
am
carbonnell
said
i
taking
his
hand
my
dear
fellow
i
know
it
is
all
over
with
me
and
you
of
course
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
source
of
much
regret
to
me
to
leave
this
rascally
world
indeed
it
is
not
but
i
do
feel
sorry
very
sorry
to
leave
you
the
doctor
tells
me
i
shall
live
hours
but
i
have
an
idea
that
i
shall
not
live
so
many
minutes
i
feel
my
strength
gradually
failing
me
depend
upon
it
my
dear
newland
there
is
an
internal
haemorrhage
my
dear
fellow
i
shall
not
be
able
to
speak
soon
i
have
left
you
my
executor
and
sole
heir
i
wish
there
was
more
for
you
it
will
last
you
however
till
you
come
of
age
that
was
a
lucky
hit
last
night
but
a
very
unlucky
one
this
morning
bury
me
like
a
gentleman
my
dear
carbonnell
said
i
would
you
not
like
to
see
somebody
a
clergyman
newland
excuse
me
i
do
not
refuse
it
out
of
disrespect
or
because
i
do
not
believe
in
the
tenets
of
christianity
but
i
can
not
believe
that
my
repentance
at
this
late
hour
can
be
of
any
avail
if
i
have
not
been
sorry
for
the
life
i
have
lived
if
i
have
not
had
my
moments
of
remorse
if
i
have
not
promised
to
amend
and
intended
to
have
so
done
and
i
trust
i
have
what
avails
my
repentance
now
no
no
japhet
as
i
have
sown
so
must
i
reap
and
trust
to
the
mercy
of
heaven
god
only
knows
all
our
hearts
and
i
would
fain
believe
that
i
may
find
more
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
almighty
than
i
have
in
this
world
from
those
who
but
we
must
not
judge
give
me
to
drink
japhet
i
am
sinking
fast
god
bless
you
my
dear
fellow
the
major
sank
on
his
pillow
after
he
had
moistened
his
lips
and
spoke
no
more
with
his
hand
clasped
in
mine
he
gradually
sank
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
all
was
over
he
was
right
in
his
conjectures
an
artery
had
been
divided
and
he
had
bled
to
death
the
surgeon
came
again
just
before
he
was
dead
for
i
had
sent
for
him
it
is
better
as
it
is
said
he
to
me
had
he
not
bled
to
death
he
would
have
suffered
forty
eight
hours
of
extreme
agony
from
the
mortification
which
must
have
ensued
he
closed
the
major
eyes
and
took
his
leave
and
i
hastened
into
the
and
sent
for
timothy
with
whom
i
sate
in
a
long
conversation
on
this
unfortunate
occurrence
and
my
future
prospects
my
grief
for
the
death
of
the
major
was
sincere
much
may
indeed
be
ascribed
to
habit
from
our
long
residence
and
companionship
but
more
to
the
knowledge
that
the
major
with
all
his
faults
had
redeeming
qualities
and
that
the
world
had
driven
him
to
become
what
he
had
been
i
had
the
further
conviction
that
he
was
attached
to
me
and
in
my
situation
anything
like
affection
was
most
precious
his
funeral
was
handsome
without
being
ostentatious
and
i
paid
every
demand
upon
him
which
i
knew
to
be
just
many
indeed
that
were
not
sent
in
from
a
supposition
that
any
claim
made
would
be
useless
his
debts
were
not
much
above
pounds
and
these
debts
had
never
been
expected
to
be
liquidated
by
those
who
had
given
him
credit
the
paper
he
had
written
and
had
been
witnessed
by
timothy
and
another
was
a
short
will
in
which
he
left
me
his
sole
heir
and
executor
the
whole
of
his
property
consisted
of
his
house
in
saint
james
street
the
contents
of
his
intrusted
to
my
care
and
his
personal
effects
which
especially
in
bijouterie
were
valuable
the
house
was
worth
about
pounds
as
he
had
told
me
in
his
were
notes
to
the
amount
of
pounds
and
his
other
effects
might
be
valued
at
pounds
with
all
his
debts
and
funeral
expenses
liquidated
and
with
my
own
money
i
found
myself
in
possession
of
about
pounds
a
sum
which
never
could
have
been
credited
for
it
was
generally
supposed
that
he
died
worth
less
than
nothing
having
lived
for
a
long
while
upon
a
capital
of
a
similar
value
i
can
not
but
say
observed
timothy
but
that
this
is
very
fortunate
had
the
major
not
persuaded
you
to
borrow
money
he
never
would
have
won
so
large
a
sum
had
he
lived
he
would
have
squandered
it
away
but
just
in
the
nick
of
time
he
is
killed
and
makes
you
his
heir
there
is
truth
in
your
observation
timothy
but
now
you
must
go
to
mr
emmanuel
that
i
may
pay
him
off
i
will
repay
the
pounds
lent
me
by
lord
windermear
into
his
banker
and
then
i
must
execute
one
part
of
the
poor
major
will
he
left
his
diamond
solitaire
as
a
memento
to
his
lordship
bring
it
to
me
and
i
will
call
and
present
it
part
two
chapter
eight
a
chapter
full
of
morality
which
ends
in
a
jew
refusing
upwards
of
pounds
proving
the
millennium
to
be
nearly
at
hand
this
conversation
took
place
the
day
after
the
funeral
and
attired
in
deep
mourning
i
called
upon
his
lordship
and
was
admitted
his
lordship
had
sent
his
carriage
to
attend
the
funeral
and
was
also
in
mourning
when
he
received
me
i
executed
my
commission
and
after
a
long
conversation
with
his
lordship
in
which
i
confided
to
him
the
contents
of
the
will
and
the
amount
of
property
of
the
deceased
i
rose
to
take
my
leave
excuse
me
mr
newland
said
he
but
what
do
you
now
propose
to
do
i
confess
i
feel
a
strong
interest
about
you
and
had
wished
that
you
had
come
to
me
oftener
without
an
invitation
i
perceive
that
you
never
will
have
you
no
intention
of
following
up
any
pursuit
yes
my
lord
i
intend
to
search
after
my
father
and
i
trust
that
by
husbanding
my
unexpected
resources
i
shall
now
be
able
you
have
the
credit
in
the
fashionable
world
of
possessing
a
large
fortune
that
is
not
my
fault
my
lord
it
is
through
major
carbonnell
mistake
that
the
world
is
deceived
still
i
must
acknowledge
myself
so
far
participator
that
i
have
never
contradicted
the
report
meaning
i
presume
by
some
good
match
to
reap
the
advantage
of
the
supposition
not
so
my
lord
i
assure
you
people
may
deceive
themselves
but
i
will
not
deceive
them
nor
undeceive
them
mr
newland
undeceive
them
i
will
not
nay
if
i
did
make
the
attempt
i
should
not
be
believed
they
never
would
believe
it
possible
that
i
could
have
lived
so
long
with
your
relative
without
having
had
a
large
supply
of
money
they
might
believe
that
i
had
run
through
my
money
but
not
that
i
never
had
any
there
is
a
knowledge
of
the
world
in
that
remark
replied
his
lordship
but
i
interrupted
you
so
proceed
i
mean
to
observe
my
lord
and
you
by
your
knowledge
of
my
previous
history
can
best
judge
how
far
i
am
warranted
in
saying
so
that
i
have
as
yet
steered
the
middle
course
between
that
which
is
dishonest
and
honest
if
the
world
deceives
itself
you
would
say
that
in
strict
honesty
i
ought
to
undeceive
it
so
i
would
my
lord
if
it
were
not
for
my
peculiar
situation
but
at
the
same
time
i
will
if
possible
be
guilty
of
direct
deceit
that
is
to
say
i
would
not
take
advantage
of
my
supposed
wealth
to
marry
a
young
person
of
large
fortune
i
would
state
myself
a
beggar
and
gain
her
affections
as
a
beggar
a
woman
can
have
little
confidence
in
a
man
who
deceives
her
before
marriage
your
secret
will
always
be
safe
with
me
mr
newland
you
have
a
right
to
demand
it
i
am
glad
to
hear
the
sentiments
which
you
have
expressed
they
are
not
founded
perhaps
upon
the
strictest
code
of
morality
but
there
are
many
who
profess
more
who
do
not
act
up
to
so
much
still
i
wish
you
would
think
in
what
way
i
may
be
able
to
serve
you
for
your
life
at
present
is
useless
and
unprofitable
and
may
tend
to
warp
still
more
ideas
which
are
not
quite
so
strict
as
they
ought
to
be
my
lord
i
have
but
one
object
in
allowing
the
world
to
continue
in
their
error
relative
to
my
means
which
is
that
it
procures
for
me
an
entrance
into
that
society
in
which
i
have
a
moral
conviction
that
i
shall
find
my
father
i
have
but
one
pursuit
one
end
to
attain
which
is
to
succeed
in
that
search
i
return
you
a
thousand
thanks
for
your
kind
expressions
and
good
will
but
i
can
not
at
present
avail
myself
of
them
i
beg
your
lordship
pardon
but
did
you
ever
meet
the
lady
with
the
lord
windermear
smiled
really
mr
newland
you
are
a
very
strange
person
not
content
with
finding
out
your
own
parents
you
must
also
be
searching
after
other
people
not
that
i
do
not
commend
your
conduct
in
this
instance
but
i
afraid
in
running
after
shadows
you
are
too
indifferent
to
the
substance
ah
my
lord
it
is
very
well
for
you
to
argue
who
have
had
a
father
and
mother
and
never
felt
the
want
of
them
but
if
you
knew
how
my
heart
yearns
after
my
parents
you
would
not
be
surprised
at
my
perseverance
i
am
surprised
at
nothing
in
this
world
mr
newland
everyone
pursues
happiness
in
his
own
way
your
happiness
appears
to
be
centred
in
one
feeling
and
you
are
only
acting
as
the
world
does
in
general
but
recollect
that
the
search
after
happiness
ends
in
disappointment
i
grant
it
but
too
often
does
my
lord
but
there
is
pleasure
in
the
chase
replied
i
well
go
and
may
you
prosper
all
i
can
say
is
this
mr
newland
do
not
have
that
false
pride
not
to
apply
to
me
when
you
need
assistance
recollect
it
is
much
better
to
be
under
an
obligation
if
such
you
will
consider
it
than
to
do
that
which
is
wrong
and
that
it
is
a
very
false
pride
which
would
blush
to
accept
a
favour
and
yet
not
blush
to
do
what
it
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
promise
me
mr
newland
that
upon
any
reverse
or
exigence
you
will
apply
to
me
i
candidly
acknowledge
to
your
lordship
that
i
would
rather
be
under
an
obligation
to
anyone
but
you
and
i
trust
you
will
clearly
appreciate
my
feelings
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
refunding
the
one
thousand
pounds
you
were
so
kind
as
to
place
at
my
disposal
as
a
loan
at
the
same
time
i
will
promise
that
if
at
any
time
i
should
require
your
assistance
i
will
again
request
leave
to
become
your
debtor
i
rose
again
to
depart
farewell
newland
when
i
thought
you
had
behaved
ill
and
i
offered
to
better
you
you
only
demanded
my
good
opinion
you
have
it
and
have
it
so
firmly
that
it
will
not
easily
be
shaken
his
lordship
then
shook
hands
with
me
and
i
took
my
leave
on
my
return
i
found
emmanuel
the
who
had
accompanied
timothy
fancying
that
i
was
in
want
of
more
assistance
and
but
too
willing
to
give
it
his
surprise
was
very
great
when
i
told
him
that
i
wished
to
repay
the
money

had
borrowed

dis

very
strange
i

respects
so
saying
the
jew
walked
out
of
the
room
with
his
arm
behind
his
back
as
usual
part
two
chapter
nine
i
decide
upon
honesty
as
the
best
policy
and
what
is
more
strange
receive
legal
advice
upon
this
important
point
timothy
and
i
burst
into
laughter
really
timothy
observed
i
it
appears
that
very
little
art
is
necessary
to
deceive
the
world
for
in
every
instance
they
will
deceive
themselves
the
jew
is
off
my
conscience
at
all
events
and
now
he
never
will
be
paid
until
until
when
japhet
until
i
find
out
my
father
replied
i
everything
is
put
off
till
that
time
arrives
i
observe
said
timothy
other
people
will
soon
be
as
interested
in
the
search
as
yourself
i
wish
they
were
unfortunately
it
is
a
secret
which
can
not
be
divulged
a
ring
at
the
bell
called
timothy
down
stairs
he
returned
with
a
letter
it
was
from
lord
windermear
and
ran
as
follows
my
dear
newland
i
have
been
thinking
about
you
ever
since
you
left
me
this
morning
and
as
you
appear
resolved
to
prosecute
your
search
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
you
should
go
about
it
in
a
more
systematic
way
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
what
i
now
propose
will
prove
of
any
advantage
to
you
but
still
it
may
as
you
will
have
a
very
old
and
very
clever
head
to
advise
with
i
refer
to
mr
masterton
my
legal
adviser
from
whom
you
had
the
papers
which
led
to
our
first
acquaintance
he
is
aware
that
you
were
i
beg
your
pardon
an
impostor
as
he
has
since
seen
mr
estcourt
the
letter
enclosed
is
for
him
and
with
that
in
your
hand
you
may
face
him
boldly
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
he
will
assist
you
all
in
his
power
and
put
you
to
no
expense
narrate
your
whole
history
to
him
and
then
you
will
hear
what
he
may
propose
he
has
many
secrets
much
more
important
than
yours
wishing
you
every
success
that
your
perseverance
deserves
believe
me
yours
very
truly
windermear
i
believe
the
advice
to
be
good
said
i
after
reading
the
letter
i
am
myself
at
fault
and
hardly
know
how
to
proceed
i
think
i
will
go
at
once
to
the
old
gentleman
timothy
it
can
do
no
harm
if
it
does
no
good
two
heads
are
better
than
one
replied
timothy
some
secrets
are
too
well
kept
and
deserting
a
child
is
one
of
those
which
is
confided
but
to
few
timothy
here
have
i
been
more
than
so
many
years
out
of
the
foundling
hospital
and
have
never
yet
inquired
if
anyone
has
ever
been
to
reclaim
me
very
true
and
i
think
i
step
myself
to
the
workhouse
at
saint
bridget
and
ask
whether
anyone
has
asked
about
me
replied
timothy
with
a
grin
there
is
another
thing
that
i
have
neglected
observed
i
which
is
to
inquire
at
the
address
in
coleman
street
if
there
is
any
letter
from
melchior
i
have
often
thought
of
him
replied
timothy
i
wonder
who
he
can
be
there
is
another
mystery
there
i
wonder
whether
we
shall
ever
fall
in
with
him
again
and
nattee
too
there
no
saying
timothy
i
wonder
where
that
poor
fool
philotas
and
our
friend
jumbo
are
now
the
remembrance
of
the
two
last
personages
made
us
both
burst
out
a
laughing
timothy
i
been
reflecting
that
my
intimacy
with
poor
carbonnell
has
rather
hindered
than
assisted
me
in
my
search
he
found
me
with
a
good
appearance
and
he
has
moulded
me
into
a
gentleman
so
far
as
manners
and
appearance
are
concerned
but
the
constant
vortex
in
which
i
have
been
whirled
in
his
company
has
prevented
me
from
doing
anything
his
melancholy
death
has
perhaps
been
fortunate
for
me
it
has
left
me
more
independent
in
circumstances
and
more
free
i
must
now
really
set
to
in
earnest
i
beg
your
pardon
japhet
but
did
not
you
say
the
same
when
we
first
set
off
on
our
travels
and
yet
remain
more
than
a
year
with
the
gipsies
did
not
you
make
the
same
resolution
when
we
arrived
in
town
with
our
pockets
full
of
money
and
yet
once
into
fashionable
society
think
but
little
and
occasionally
of
it
now
you
make
the
same
resolution
and
how
long
will
you
keep
it
nay
timothy
that
remark
is
hardly
fair
you
know
that
the
subject
is
ever
in
my
thoughts
in
your
thoughts
i
grant
very
frequently
but
you
have
still
been
led
away
from
the
search
i
grant
it
but
i
presume
that
arises
from
not
knowing
how
to
proceed
i
have
a
skein
to
unravel
and
can
not
find
out
an
end
to
commence
with
i
always
thought
people
commenced
with
the
beginning
replied
tim
laughing
at
all
events
i
will
now
try
back
and
face
the
old
lawyer
do
you
call
at
coleman
street
tim
and
at
saint
bridget
also
if
you
please
as
for
saint
bridget
i
in
no
particular
hurry
about
my
mother
if
i
stumble
upon
her
i
may
pick
her
up
but
i
never
make
diligent
search
after
what
in
every
probability
will
not
be
worth
the
finding
leaving
timothy
to
go
his
way
i
walked
to
the
house
at
lincoln
inn
which
i
had
before
entered
upon
the
memorable
occasion
of
the
papers
of
estcourt
as
before
i
rang
the
bell
the
door
swang
open
and
i
was
once
more
in
the
presence
of
mr
masterton
i
have
a
letter
sir
said
i
bowing
and
presenting
the
letter
from
lord
windermear
the
old
gentleman
peered
at
me
through
his
spectacles
why
we
have
met
before
bless
me
why
you
the
rogue
that
you
are
perfectly
right
sir
interrupted
i
i
am
the
rogue
who
presented
the
letter
from
lord
windermear
and
who
presents
you
with
another
from
the
same
person
do
me
the
favour
to
read
it
while
i
take
a
chair
upon
my
soul
you
impudent
handsome
dog
i
must
say
great
pity
come
for
money
i
suppose
well
it
a
sad
world
muttered
the
lawyer
as
he
broke
open
the
letter
of
lord
windermear
i
made
no
reply
but
watched
his
countenance
which
changed
to
that
of
an
expression
of
surprise
had
his
lordship
sent
me
a
request
to
have
you
hanged
if
possible
said
mr
masterton
i
should
have
felt
no
surprise
but
in
this
letter
he
praises
you
and
desires
me
to
render
you
all
the
service
in
my
power
i
ca
understand
it
no
sir
but
if
you
have
leisure
to
listen
to
me
you
will
then
find
that
in
this
world
we
may
be
deceived
by
appearances
well
and
so
i
was
when
i
first
saw
you
i
never
could
have
believed
you
to
be
but
never
mind
perhaps
sir
in
an
hour
or
two
you
will
again
alter
your
opinion
are
you
at
leisure
or
will
you
make
an
appointment
for
some
future
day
mr
newland
i
am
not
at
leisure
i
never
was
more
busy
and
if
you
had
come
on
any
legal
business
i
should
have
put
you
off
for
three
or
four
days
at
least
but
my
curiosity
is
so
raised
that
i
am
determined
that
i
will
indulge
it
at
the
expense
of
my
interest
i
will
turn
the
key
and
then
you
will
oblige
me
by
unravelling
what
at
present
is
to
me
as
curious
as
it
is
wholly
incomprehensible
part
two
chapter
ten
i
attempt
to
profit
by
intelligence
i
receive
and
throw
a
lady
into
hysterics
in
about
three
hours
i
had
narrated
the
history
of
my
life
up
to
the
very
day
almost
as
much
detailed
as
it
has
been
to
the
reader
and
now
mr
masterton
said
i
as
i
wound
up
my
narrative
do
you
think
that
i
deserve
the
title
of
rogue
which
you
applied
to
me
when
i
came
in
upon
my
word
mr
newland
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
but
i
like
to
tell
the
truth
to
say
that
you
have
been
quite
honest
would
not
be
correct
a
rogue
to
a
certain
degree
you
have
been
but
you
have
been
the
rogue
of
circumstances
i
can
only
say
this
that
there
are
greater
rogues
than
you
whose
characters
are
unblemished
in
the
world
that
most
people
in
your
peculiar
situation
would
have
been
much
greater
rogues
and
lastly
that
rogue
or
not
rogue
i
have
great
pleasure
in
taking
you
by
the
hand
and
will
do
all
i
possibly
can
to
serve
you
and
that
for
your
own
sake
your
search
after
your
parents
i
consider
almost
tantamount
to
a
chase
but
still
as
your
happiness
depends
upon
it
i
suppose
it
must
be
carried
on
but
you
must
allow
me
time
for
reflection
i
will
consider
what
may
be
the
most
judicious
method
of
proceeding
can
you
dine
with
me
here
on
friday
and
we
then
will
talk
over
the
matter
on
friday
sir
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
engaged
to
lady
maelstrom
but
that
is
of
no
consequence
i
will
write
an
excuse
to
her
ladyship
lady
maelstrom
how
very
odd
that
you
should
bring
up
her
name
after
our
conversation
why
so
my
dear
sir
why
replied
mr
masterton
chuckling
because
recollect
it
is
a
secret
mr
newland
i
remember
some
twenty
years
ago
when
she
was
a
girl
of
eighteen
before
she
married
she
had
a
little
and
i
was
called
in
about
a
settlement
for
the
maintenance
of
the
child
is
it
possible
sir
replied
i
anxiously
yes
she
was
violently
attached
to
a
young
officer
without
money
but
of
good
family
some
say
it
was
a
private
marriage
others
that
he
was
a
it
was
all
hushed
up
but
he
was
obliged
by
the
friends
before
he
left
for
the
west
indies
to
sign
a
deed
of
maintenance
and
i
was
the
party
called
in
i
never
heard
any
more
about
it
the
officer
name
was
warrender
he
died
of
the
yellow
fever
i
believe
and
after
his
death
she
married
lord
maelstrom
he
is
dead
then
replied
i
mournfully
well
that
can
not
affect
you
my
good
fellow
on
friday
then
at
six
precisely
good
afternoon
mr
newland
i
shook
hands
with
the
old
gentleman
and
returned
home
but
my
brain
whirled
with
the
fear
of
a
confirmation
of
that
which
mr
masterton
had
so
carelessly
conveyed
anything
like
a
possibility
immediately
was
swelled
to
a
certainty
in
my
imagination
so
ardent
and
heated
on
the
one
subject
and
as
soon
as
i
regained
my
room
i
threw
myself
on
the
sofa
and
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
i
tried
to
approximate
the
features
of
lady
maelstrom
to
mine
but
all
the
ingenuity
in
the
world
could
not
affect
that
but
still
i
might
be
like
my
father
but
my
father
was
dead
and
that
threw
a
chill
over
the
whole
glowing
picture
which
i
had
as
usual
conjured
up
besides
it
was
asserted
that
i
was
born
in
wedlock
and
there
was
a
doubt
relative
to
the
marriage
of
her
ladyship
after
a
long
cogitation
i
jumped
up
seized
my
hat
and
set
off
for
grosvenor
square
determining
to
ask
a
private
interview
with
her
ladyship
and
at
once
end
my
harassing
doubts
and
surmises
i
think
there
could
not
be
a
greater
proof
of
my
madness
than
my
venturing
to
attack
a
lady
of
forty
upon
the
irregularities
of
her
youth
and
to
question
her
upon
a
subject
which
had
been
confided
but
to
two
or
three
and
she
imagined
had
been
long
forgotten
but
this
never
struck
me
all
considerations
were
levelled
in
my
ardent
pursuit
i
walked
through
the
streets
at
a
rapid
pace
the
crowd
passed
by
me
as
shadows
i
neither
saw
nor
distinguished
them
i
was
deep
in
reverie
as
to
the
best
way
of
breaking
the
subject
to
her
ladyship
for
notwithstanding
my
monomania
i
perceived
it
to
be
a
point
of
great
delicacy
after
having
overturned
about
twenty
people
in
my
mad
career
i
arrived
at
the
door
and
knocked
my
heart
beat
almost
as
hard
against
my
ribs
with
excitement
is
her
ladyship
at
home
yes
sir
i
was
ushered
into
the
and
found
her
sitting
with
two
of
her
nieces
the
misses
fairfax
mr
newland
you
have
been
quite
a
stranger
said
her
ladyship
as
i
walked
up
to
her
and
made
my
obeisance
i
did
intend
to
scold
you
well
but
i
suppose
that
sad
affair
of
poor
major
carbonnell
has
been
a
heavy
blow
to
you
you
were
so
intimate
lived
together
i
believe
did
you
not
however
you
have
not
so
much
cause
to
regret
for
he
was
not
a
very
proper
companion
for
young
men
like
you
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
consider
it
as
a
fortunate
circumstance
that
he
was
removed
for
he
would
by
degrees
have
led
you
into
all
manner
of
mischief
and
have
persuaded
you
to
squander
your
fortune
i
did
at
one
time
think
of
giving
you
a
hint
but
it
was
a
delicate
point
now
that
he
is
gone
i
tell
you
very
candidly
that
you
have
had
an
escape
a
young
man
like
you
mr
newland
who
could
command
an
alliance
into
the
highest
yes
the
very
highest
families
and
let
me
tell
you
mr
newland
that
there
is
nothing
like
connection
money
is
of
no
consequence
to
you
but
connection
mr
newland
is
what
you
should
look
for
connection
with
some
high
family
and
then
you
will
do
well
i
should
like
to
see
you
settled
well
settled
i
mean
mr
newland
now
that
you
are
rid
of
the
major
who
has
ruined
many
young
men
in
his
time
i
trust
you
will
seriously
think
of
settling
down
into
a
married
man
cecilia
my
dear
show
your
tambour
work
to
mr
newland
and
ask
him
his
opinion
is
it
not
beautiful
mr
newland
extremely
beautiful
indeed
replied
i
glad
at
last
that
her
ladyship
allowed
me
to
speak
a
word
emma
my
dear
you
look
pale
you
must
go
out
into
the
air
go
children
put
your
bonnets
on
and
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
when
the
carriage
comes
round
i
will
send
for
you
the
young
ladies
quitted
the
room
nice
innocent
girls
mr
newland
but
you
are
not
partial
to
blondes
i
believe
indeed
lady
maelstrom
i
infinitely
prefer
the
blonde
to
the
brunette
that
proves
your
taste
mr
newland
the
fairfaxes
are
of
a
very
old
family
saxon
mr
newland
is
saxon
for
light
hair
is
is
not
remarkable
that
they
should
be
blondes
to
this
day
pure
blood
mr
newland
you
of
course
have
heard
of
general
fairfax
in
the
time
of
cromwell
he
was
their
direct
ancestor
an
excellent
family
and
highly
connected
mr
newland
you
are
aware
that
they
are
my
nieces
my
sister
married
mr
fairfax
i
paid
the
misses
fairfax
the
compliments
which
i
thought
they
really
deserved
for
they
were
very
pretty
amiable
girls
and
required
no
puffing
on
the
part
of
her
ladyship
and
then
i
commenced
your
ladyship
has
expressed
such
kind
wishes
towards
me
that
i
can
not
be
sufficiently
grateful
but
perhaps
your
ladyship
may
think
me
romantic
i
am
resolved
never
to
marry
except
for
love
a
very
excellent
resolve
mr
newland
there
are
few
young
men
who
care
about
love
but
i
consider
that
love
is
a
great
security
for
happiness
in
the
wedded
state
true
madam
and
what
can
be
more
delightful
than
a
first
attachment
i
appeal
to
your
ladyship
was
not
your
first
attachment
the
most
delightful
are
not
the
reminiscences
most
lasting
do
you
not
even
now
call
to
mind
those
halcyon
days
when
love
was
all
and
everything
my
days
of
romance
are
long
past
mr
newland
replied
her
ladyship
indeed
i
never
had
much
romance
in
my
composition
i
married
lord
maelstrom
for
the
connection
and
i
loved
him
pretty
well
that
is
soberly
mr
newland
i
mean
i
loved
him
quite
enough
to
marry
him
and
to
obey
my
parents
that
is
all
but
my
dear
lady
maelstrom
i
did
not
refer
to
your
marriage
with
his
lordship
i
referred
to
your
first
love
my
first
love
mr
newland
pray
what
do
you
mean
replied
her
ladyship
looking
very
hard
at
me
your
ladyship
need
not
be
ashamed
of
it
our
hearts
are
not
in
our
own
keeping
nor
can
we
always
control
our
passions
i
have
but
to
mention
the
name
of
warrender
warrender
shrieked
her
ladyship
pray
mr
newland
continued
her
ladyship
recovering
herself
who
gave
you
that
piece
of
information
my
dear
lady
maelstrom
pray
do
not
be
displeased
with
me
but
i
am
very
particularly
interested
in
this
affair
your
love
for
mr
warrender
long
before
your
marriage
is
well
known
to
me
and
it
is
to
that
love
to
which
i
referred
when
i
asked
you
if
it
was
not
most
delightful
well
mr
newland
replied
her
ladyship
how
you
have
obtained
the
knowledge
i
know
not
but
there
was
i
acknowledge
a
trifling
flirtation
with
edward
warrender
and
me
but
i
was
young
very
young
at
that
time
i
grant
it
and
do
not
for
a
moment
imagine
that
i
intend
to
blame
your
ladyship
but
as
i
before
said
madam
i
am
much
interested
in
the
business
what
interest
can
you
have
with
a
little
flirtation
of
mine
which
took
place
before
you
were
born
i
can
not
imagine
mr
newland
it
is
because
it
took
place
before
i
was
born
that
i
feel
so
much
interest
i
can
not
understand
you
mr
newland
and
i
think
we
had
better
change
the
subject
excuse
me
madam
but
i
must
request
to
continue
it
a
little
longer
is
mr
warrender
dead
or
not
did
he
die
in
the
west
indies
you
appear
to
be
very
curious
on
this
subject
mr
newland
i
hardly
can
tell
yes
now
i
recollect
he
did
die
of
the
yellow
fever
i
think
but
i
have
quite
forgotten
all
about
it
and
i
shall
answer
no
more
questions
if
you
were
not
a
favourite
of
mine
mr
newland
i
should
say
that
you
were
very
impertinent
then
your
ladyship
i
will
put
but
one
more
question
and
that
one
i
must
put
with
your
permission
i
should
think
after
what
i
have
said
mr
newland
that
you
might
drop
the
subject
i
will
your
ladyship
immediately
but
pardon
me
the
question
mr
newland
do
not
be
angry
with
me
well
exclaimed
her
ladyship
who
appeared
alarmed
nothing
but
the
most
important
and
imperative
reasons
could
induce
me
to
ask
the
question
her
ladyship
gasped
for
breath
and
could
not
speak
i
stammered
but
at
last
i
brought
it
out
what
has
become
of
of
of
the
sweet
pledge
of
your
love
lady
maelstrom
her
ladyship
coloured
up
with
rage
raised
up
her
clenched
hand
and
then
fell
back
in
violent
hysterics
part
two
chapter
eleven
i
repair
the
damage
and
make
things
worse
plot
and
counterplot
tim
gains
a
watch
by
setting
watch
upon
his
tongue
i
hardly
knew
how
to
act
if
i
called
the
servants
my
interview
would
be
at
an
end
and
i
was
resolved
to
find
out
the
truth
for
the
same
reason
i
did
not
like
to
ring
for
water
some
vases
with
flowers
were
on
the
table
i
took
out
the
flowers
and
threw
the
water
in
her
face
but
they
had
been
in
the
water
some
time
and
had
discoloured
it
green
her
ladyship
dress
was
a
high
silk
gown
of
a
bright
slate
colour
and
was
immediately
spoiled
but
this
was
no
time
to
stand
upon
trifles
i
seized
hold
of
a
glass
bottle
fancying
in
my
hurry
it
was
de
or
some
essence
and
poured
a
little
into
her
mouth
unfortunately
it
was
a
bottle
of
marking
ink
which
her
ladyship
who
was
very
economical
had
on
the
table
in
disguise
i
perceived
my
error
and
had
recourse
to
another
vase
of
flowers
pouring
a
large
quantity
of
the
green
water
down
her
throat
whether
the
unusual
remedies
had
an
effect
or
not
i
can
not
tell
but
her
ladyship
gradually
revived
and
as
she
leant
back
on
the
sofa
sobbing
every
now
and
then
convulsively
i
poured
into
her
ear
a
thousand
apologies
until
i
thought
she
was
composed
enough
to
listen
to
me
your
ladyship
maternal
feelings
said
i
it
all
a
calumny
a
base
lie
sir
shrieked
she
nay
nay
why
be
ashamed
of
a
youthful
passion
why
deny
what
was
in
itself
creditable
to
your
unsophisticated
mind
does
not
your
heart
even
now
yearn
to
embrace
your
son
will
not
you
bless
me
if
i
bring
him
to
your
feet
will
not
you
bless
your
son
and
receive
him
with
delight
it
was
a
girl
screamed
her
ladyship
forgetting
herself
and
again
falling
into
hysterics
a
girl
replied
i
then
i
have
lost
my
time
and
it
is
no
use
my
remaining
here
mortified
at
the
intelligence
which
overthrew
my
hopes
and
castle
buildings
i
seized
my
hat
descended
the
stairs
and
quitted
the
house
in
my
hurry
and
confusion
quite
forgetting
to
call
the
servants
to
her
ladyship
assistance
fortunately
i
perceived
the
misses
fairfax
close
to
the
iron
railing
of
the
garden
i
crossed
the
road
wished
them
and
told
them
that
i
thought
lady
maelstrom
looked
very
ill
and
they
had
better
go
in
to
her
i
then
threw
myself
into
the
first
and
drove
home
i
found
timothy
had
arrived
before
me
and
i
narrated
all
that
had
passed
you
will
never
be
able
to
go
there
again
observed
timothy
and
depend
upon
it
she
will
be
your
enemy
through
life
i
wish
you
had
not
said
anything
to
her
what
is
done
can
not
be
undone
but
recollect
that
if
she
can
talk
i
can
talk
also
will
she
not
be
afraid
yes
openly
she
will
and
open
attacks
can
be
parried
very
true
but
it
will
be
as
well
to
pacify
her
if
i
can
i
will
write
to
her
i
sat
down
and
wrote
as
follows
my
dear
lady
maelstrom
i
am
so
astonished
and
alarmed
at
the
situation
i
put
you
in
by
my
impertinence
and
folly
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
apologise
the
fact
is
that
looking
over
some
of
my
father
old
letters
i
found
many
from
warrender
in
which
he
spoke
of
an
affair
with
a
young
lady
and
i
read
the
name
as
your
maiden
name
and
also
discovered
where
the
offspring
was
to
be
found
on
for
your
innocence
was
too
evident
at
our
meeting
to
admit
of
a
doubt
i
find
that
the
name
although
something
like
yours
is
very
and
that
i
must
have
been
led
into
an
unpardonable
error
what
can
i
say
except
that
i
throw
myself
on
your
mercy
i
dare
not
appear
before
you
again
i
leave
town
but
if
you
can
pardon
my
folly
and
impertinence
and
allow
me
to
pay
my
respects
when
london
is
full
again
and
time
shall
have
softened
down
your
just
anger
write
me
one
line
to
that
effect
and
you
will
relieve
the
burdened
conscience
of
yours
most
truly
j
newland
there
tim
said
i
as
i
finished
reading
it
over
take
that
as
a
sop
to
the
old
cerberus
she
may
think
it
prudent
as
i
have
talked
of
letters
to
believe
me
and
make
friends
i
will
not
trust
her
nevertheless
tim
went
away
and
very
soon
returned
with
an
answer
you
are
a
foolish
and
i
ought
to
shut
my
doors
against
you
you
have
half
killed
me
spoilt
my
gown
and
i
am
obliged
to
keep
my
bed
remember
in
future
to
be
sure
of
the
right
name
before
you
make
an
assertion
as
for
forgiving
you
i
shall
think
of
it
and
when
you
return
to
town
you
may
call
and
receive
my
sentence
cecilia
was
quite
frightened
poor
dear
girl
what
a
dear
affectionate
child
she
is
she
is
a
treasure
to
me
and
i
do
think
i
ever
could
part
with
her
she
sends
her
regards
yours
c
maelstrom
come
timothy
at
all
events
this
is
better
than
i
expected
but
now
i
tell
you
what
i
propose
to
do
harcourt
was
with
me
yesterday
and
he
wishes
me
to
go
down
with
him
to
there
will
be
the
assizes
and
the
county
ball
and
a
great
deal
of
gaiety
and
i
have
an
idea
that
it
is
just
as
well
to
beat
the
county
as
the
town
i
dine
with
mr
masterton
on
friday
on
saturday
i
will
go
down
and
see
fleta
and
on
tuesday
or
wednesday
i
will
start
with
harcourt
to
his
father
where
he
has
promised
me
a
hearty
welcome
was
there
anything
at
coleman
street
yes
sir
mr
iving
said
that
he
had
just
received
a
letter
from
your
correspondent
and
that
he
wished
to
know
if
the
little
girl
was
well
i
told
him
that
she
was
mr
iving
laid
the
letter
down
on
the
desk
and
i
read
the
dublin
dublin
replied
i
i
should
like
to
find
out
who
melchior
is
and
so
i
will
as
soon
as
i
can
well
sir
i
have
not
finished
my
story
mr
iving
said
correspondent
wishes
to
know
whether
the
education
of
the
little
girl
is
attended
to
replied
i
is
she
at
school
she
has
been
at
school
ever
since
we
have
been
in
london
is
she
at
school
inquired
he
now
sir
as
i
never
was
asked
that
question
by
him
before
i
did
not
know
whether
i
ought
to
give
an
answer
so
i
replied
i
did
not
know
know
whether
she
is
in
london
or
not
do
you
not
should
i
replied
i
had
put
her
to
school
before
i
put
on
his
liveries
he
never
go
to
see
her
inquired
he
suppose
so
said
i
you
really
know
nothing
about
it
then
look
you
my
lad
i
am
anxious
to
find
out
where
she
is
at
school
and
the
name
of
the
people
and
if
you
will
find
out
the
direction
for
me
it
will
be
money
in
your
pocket
that
all
replied
i
how
much
more
than
you
think
for
my
man
it
will
be
a
note
alters
the
case
replied
i
i
think
again
i
have
an
idea
that
i
do
remember
seeing
her
address
on
a
letter
my
master
wrote
to
her
replied
mr
iving
astonishing
how
money
sharpens
the
memory
i
keep
to
my
bargain
give
me
the
address
and
here
the
note
afraid
that
my
master
will
be
angry
said
i
as
if
i
did
not
much
like
to
tell
him
master
will
never
know
anything
about
it
and
you
may
serve
a
long
time
before
he
gives
you
a
note
above
your
wages
very
true
said
i
is
no
inheritance
well
then
give
me
the
money
and
i
write
it
down
and
did
you
give
it
interrupted
i
stop
a
moment
sir
and
you
shall
hear
i
wrote
down
the
address
of
that
large
school
at
kensington
which
we
pass
when
we
go
to
mr
aubrey
white
what
that
tremendous
large
board
with
yellow
letters
mrs
let
what
is
it
mrs
lipscombe
seminary
i
always
read
the
board
every
time
i
go
up
and
down
i
gave
him
the
address
miss
johnson
at
mrs
seminary
kensington
well
and
here
the
note
sir
which
i
have
fairly
earned
fairly
earned
tim
yes
fairly
earned
for
it
all
fair
to
cheat
those
who
would
cheat
you
i
can
not
altogether
agree
with
you
on
that
point
tim
but
it
certainly
is
no
more
than
they
deserve
but
this
is
matter
for
reflection
why
should
melchior
wish
to
find
out
her
address
without
my
knowledge
depend
upon
it
there
is
something
wrong
that
what
i
said
to
myself
coming
home
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
for
some
reason
or
another
he
wishes
to
regain
possession
of
her
i
entertain
the
same
idea
timothy
and
i
am
glad
you
have
disappointed
him
i
will
take
care
that
they
shall
not
find
her
out
now
that
i
am
upon
my
guard
but
sir
i
wish
to
draw
one
good
moral
from
this
circumstance
which
is
that
if
you
had
been
served
by
any
common
footman
your
interest
would
in
all
probability
have
been
sacrificed
to
the
note
and
that
not
only
in
this
instance
but
in
many
others
i
did
a
very
wise
thing
in
taking
my
present
situation
i
am
but
too
well
aware
of
that
tim
my
dear
fellow
said
i
extending
my
hand
and
depend
upon
it
that
if
i
rise
you
do
you
know
me
well
enough
by
this
time
yes
i
do
japhet
and
had
rather
serve
you
than
the
first
nobleman
in
the
land
i
going
to
purchase
a
watch
with
this
note
and
i
never
shall
look
at
it
without
remembering
the
advantage
of
keeping
a
watch
over
my
tongue
part
two
chapter
twelve
i
fall
very
much
in
love
with
honesty
because
i
find
that
it
is
well
received
in
the
world
and
to
prove
my
honesty
inform
the
whole
world
that
honest
i
have
never
been
i
proved
the
will
of
major
carbonnell
in
which
there
was
no
difficulty
and
then
i
sat
down
to
consider
in
what
way
i
might
best
husband
my
resources
the
house
was
in
good
repair
and
well
furnished
at
the
time
that
i
lived
with
the
major
we
had
our
and
his
and
another
room
equally
large
used
as
his
on
the
first
floor
the
second
floor
was
appropriated
to
me
and
the
was
used
as
a
when
we
dined
at
home
which
was
but
seldom
the
basement
was
let
as
a
shop
at
one
hundred
pounds
per
annum
but
we
had
a
private
door
for
entrance
and
the
kitchens
and
attics
i
resolved
to
retain
only
the
first
floor
and
let
the
remainder
of
the
house
and
i
very
soon
got
a
tenant
at
sixty
pounds
per
annum
the
attics
were
appropriated
to
timothy
and
the
servants
belonging
to
the
lodger
after
having
disposed
of
what
was
of
no
service
to
me
i
found
that
deducting
the
thousand
pounds
paid
into
the
banker
for
lord
windermear
i
had
a
little
above
three
thousand
pounds
in
ready
money
and
what
to
do
with
this
i
could
not
well
decide
i
applied
to
mr
masterton
stating
the
exact
amount
of
my
finances
on
the
day
that
i
dined
with
him
and
he
replied
you
have
two
good
tenants
bringing
you
in
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
per
annum
if
this
money
is
put
out
on
mortgage
i
can
procure
you
five
per
cent
which
will
be
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
per
annum
now
the
question
is
do
you
think
that
you
can
live
upon
three
hundred
and
ten
pounds
per
annum
you
have
no
rent
to
pay
and
i
should
think
that
as
you
are
not
at
any
great
expense
for
a
servant
you
might
with
economy
do
very
well
recollect
that
if
your
money
is
lent
on
mortgage
you
will
not
be
able
to
obtain
it
at
a
moment
warning
so
reflect
well
before
you
decide
i
consulted
with
timothy
and
agreed
to
lend
the
money
reserving
about
two
hundred
pounds
to
go
on
with
until
i
should
receive
my
rents
and
interest
on
the
friday
i
went
to
dine
with
mr
masterton
and
narrated
what
had
passed
between
me
and
lady
maelstrom
he
was
very
much
diverted
and
laughed
immoderately
upon
my
faith
mr
newland
but
you
have
a
singular
species
of
madness
you
first
attack
lord
windermear
then
a
bishop
and
to
crown
all
you
attack
a
dowager
peeress
i
must
acknowledge
that
if
you
do
not
find
out
your
parents
it
will
not
be
for
want
of
inquiry
altogether
you
are
a
most
singular
character
your
history
is
most
singular
and
your
good
fortune
is
equally
so
you
have
made
more
friends
before
you
have
come
to
age
than
most
people
do
in
their
whole
lives
you
commence
the
world
with
nothing
and
here
you
are
with
almost
a
competence
have
paid
off
a
loan
of
one
thousand
pounds
which
was
not
required
and
are
moving
in
the
best
society
now
the
only
drawback
i
perceive
in
all
this
is
that
you
are
in
society
under
false
colours
having
made
people
suppose
that
you
are
possessed
of
a
large
fortune
it
was
not
exactly
my
assertion
sir
no
i
grant
not
exactly
but
you
have
been
a
party
to
it
and
i
can
not
allow
that
there
is
any
difference
now
do
you
mean
to
allow
this
supposition
to
remain
uncontradicted
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
sir
if
i
were
to
state
that
i
have
nothing
but
a
bare
competence
it
will
be
only
injurious
to
the
of
major
carbonnell
all
the
world
will
suppose
that
he
has
ruined
me
and
that
i
had
the
fortune
whereas
on
the
contrary
it
is
to
him
that
i
am
indebted
for
my
present
favourable
position
that
may
be
very
true
mr
newland
but
if
i
am
to
consider
you
as
my
protege
and
i
may
add
the
protege
of
lord
windermear
i
must
make
you
i
will
be
no
party
to
fraud
in
any
shape
are
you
prepared
to
resign
your
borrowed
plumes
and
appear
before
the
world
as
you
really
are
there
is
but
one
inducement
sir
for
me
to
wish
that
the
world
may
still
deceive
themselves
i
may
be
thrown
out
of
society
and
lose
the
opportunity
of
discovering
my
parents
and
pray
mr
newland
which
do
you
think
is
more
likely
to
tend
to
the
discovery
a
general
knowledge
that
you
are
a
foundling
in
search
of
your
parents
or
your
present
method
of
taxing
everybody
upon
suspicion
if
your
parents
wish
to
reclaim
you
they
will
then
have
their
eyes
directed
towards
you
from
your
position
being
known
and
i
will
add
there
are
few
parents
who
will
not
be
proud
of
you
as
a
son
you
will
have
the
patronage
of
lord
windermear
which
will
always
secure
you
a
position
in
society
and
the
good
wishes
of
all
although
i
grant
that
such
worldly
people
as
lady
maelstrom
may
strike
your
name
off
their
porter
list
you
will
moreover
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
the
friends
which
you
make
have
not
been
made
under
false
colours
and
appearances
and
a
still
further
satisfaction
arising
from
a
good
conscience
i
am
convinced
sir
and
i
thank
you
for
your
advice
i
will
now
be
guided
by
you
in
everything
give
me
your
hand
my
good
lad
i
now
will
be
your
friend
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
i
only
wish
sir
replied
i
much
affected
that
you
were
also
my
father
thank
you
for
the
wish
as
it
implies
that
you
have
a
good
opinion
of
me
what
do
you
mean
to
do
i
have
promised
my
friend
mr
harcourt
to
go
down
with
him
to
his
father
well
and
before
i
go
i
will
undeceive
him
you
are
right
you
will
then
find
whether
he
is
a
friend
to
you
or
to
your
supposed
ten
thousand
pounds
per
annum
i
have
been
reflecting
and
i
am
not
aware
that
anything
else
can
be
done
at
present
than
acknowledging
to
the
world
who
you
really
are
which
is
more
likely
to
tend
to
the
discovery
of
your
parents
than
any
other
means
but
at
the
same
time
i
shall
not
be
idle
all
we
lawyers
have
among
us
strange
secrets
and
among
my
fraternity
to
whom
i
shall
speak
openly
i
think
it
possible
that
something
may
be
found
out
which
may
serve
as
a
clue
do
not
be
annoyed
at
being
cut
by
many
when
your
history
is
known
those
who
cut
you
are
those
whose
acquaintance
and
friendship
are
not
worth
having
it
will
unmask
your
flatterers
from
your
friends
and
you
will
not
repent
of
your
having
been
honest
in
the
end
it
is
the
best
policy
even
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
come
to
me
as
often
as
you
please
i
am
always
at
home
to
you
and
always
your
friend
such
was
the
result
of
my
dinner
with
mr
masterton
which
i
narrated
to
timothy
as
soon
as
i
returned
home
well
japhet
i
think
you
have
found
a
real
friend
in
mr
masterton
and
i
am
glad
that
you
have
decided
upon
following
his
advice
as
for
me
i
am
not
under
false
colours
i
am
in
my
right
situation
and
wish
no
more
in
pursuance
of
my
promise
to
mr
masterton
i
called
upon
harcourt
the
next
morning
and
after
stating
my
intention
to
go
down
for
a
day
or
two
into
the
country
to
see
a
little
girl
who
was
under
my
care
i
said
to
him
harcourt
as
long
as
we
were
only
town
acquaintances
mixing
in
society
and
under
no
peculiar
obligation
to
each
other
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
undeceive
you
on
a
point
in
which
major
carbonnell
was
deceived
himself
and
has
deceived
others
but
now
that
you
have
offered
to
introduce
me
into
the
bosom
of
your
family
i
can
not
allow
you
to
remain
in
error
it
is
generally
supposed
that
i
am
about
to
enter
into
a
large
property
when
i
come
of
age
now
so
far
from
that
being
the
case
i
have
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
bare
competence
and
the
friendship
of
lord
windermear
in
fact
i
am
a
deserted
child
ignorant
of
my
parents
and
most
anxious
to
discover
them
as
i
have
every
reason
to
suppose
that
i
am
of
no
mean
birth
i
tell
you
this
candidly
and
unless
you
renew
the
invitation
shall
consider
that
it
has
not
been
given
harcourt
remained
a
short
time
without
answering
you
really
have
astonished
me
newland
but
continued
he
extending
his
hand
i
admire
i
respect
you
and
i
feel
that
i
shall
like
you
better
with
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
you
were
above
me
now
we
are
but
equals
i
as
a
younger
brother
have
but
a
bare
competence
as
well
as
you
and
as
for
parents
for
the
benefit
i
now
derive
from
them
i
might
as
well
have
none
not
but
my
father
is
a
worthy
fine
old
gentleman
but
the
estates
are
entailed
he
is
obliged
to
keep
up
his
position
in
society
and
he
has
a
large
family
to
provide
for
and
he
can
do
no
more
you
have
indeed
an
uncommon
moral
courage
to
have
made
this
confession
do
you
wish
it
to
be
kept
a
secret
on
the
contrary
i
wish
the
truth
to
be
known
i
am
glad
that
you
say
so
as
i
have
mentioned
you
as
a
young
man
of
large
fortune
to
my
father
but
i
feel
convinced
when
i
tell
him
this
conversation
he
will
be
much
more
pleased
in
taking
you
by
the
hand
than
if
you
were
to
come
down
and
propose
to
one
of
my
sisters
i
repeat
the
invitation
with
double
the
pleasure
that
i
gave
it
at
first
i
thank
you
harcourt
replied
i
some
day
i
will
tell
you
more
i
must
not
expect
however
that
everybody
will
prove
themselves
as
noble
in
ideas
as
yourself
perhaps
not
but
never
mind
that
on
friday
next
then
we
start
agreed
i
shook
hands
and
left
him
part
two
chapter
thirteen
i
try
back
to
recover
the
lost
scent
and
discover
to
my
astonishment
that
i
have
been
transported
for
forgery
the
behaviour
of
harcourt
was
certainly
a
good
encouragement
and
had
i
been
wavering
in
my
promise
to
mr
masterton
would
have
encouraged
me
to
proceed
i
returned
home
with
a
light
heart
and
a
pleasing
satisfaction
from
the
conviction
that
i
had
done
right
the
next
morning
i
set
off
for
and
as
it
was
a
long
while
since
i
had
seen
fleta
our
meeting
was
a
source
of
delight
on
both
sides
i
found
her
very
much
grown
and
improved
she
was
approaching
her
fifteenth
year
as
nearly
as
we
could
guess
of
course
her
exact
age
was
a
mystery
her
mind
was
equally
expanded
her
mistress
praised
her
docility
and
application
and
wished
to
know
whether
i
intended
that
she
should
be
taught
music
and
drawing
for
both
of
which
she
had
shown
a
decided
taste
to
this
i
immediately
consented
and
fleta
hung
on
my
shoulder
and
embraced
me
for
the
indulgence
she
was
now
fast
approaching
to
womanhood
and
my
feelings
towards
her
were
more
intense
than
ever
i
took
the
chain
of
coral
and
gold
beads
from
her
neck
telling
her
that
i
must
put
it
into
a
secure
place
as
much
depended
upon
them
she
was
curious
to
know
why
but
i
would
not
enter
into
the
subject
at
that
time
one
caution
i
gave
her
in
case
by
any
chance
her
retreat
should
be
discovered
by
the
companions
of
melchior
which
was
that
without
i
myself
came
she
was
on
no
account
to
leave
the
school
even
if
a
letter
from
me
was
produced
requesting
her
to
come
unless
that
letter
was
delivered
by
timothy
i
gave
the
same
directions
to
her
mistress
paid
up
her
schooling
and
expenses
and
then
left
her
promising
not
to
be
so
long
before
i
saw
her
again
on
my
return
to
town
i
deposited
the
necklace
with
mr
masterton
who
locked
it
up
carefully
in
his
iron
safe
on
the
friday
as
agreed
harcourt
and
i
accompanied
by
timothy
and
harcourt
servant
started
on
the
outside
of
the
coach
as
younger
brothers
usually
convey
themselves
for
his
father
seat
in
blank
shire
and
arrived
there
in
time
for
dinner
i
was
kindly
received
by
old
mr
harcourt
and
his
family
consisting
of
his
wife
and
three
amiable
and
beautiful
girls
but
on
the
second
day
during
which
interval
i
presume
harcourt
had
an
opportunity
of
undeceiving
his
father
i
was
delighted
to
perceive
that
the
old
gentleman
warmth
of
behaviour
towards
me
was
increased
i
remained
there
for
a
fortnight
and
never
was
so
happy
i
was
soon
on
the
most
intimate
terms
with
the
whole
family
and
was
treated
as
if
i
belonged
to
it
yet
when
i
went
to
bed
every
night
i
became
more
and
more
melancholy
i
felt
what
a
delight
it
must
be
to
have
parents
sisters
and
friends
the
bosom
of
a
family
to
retire
into
to
share
with
it
your
pleasures
and
your
pains
and
the
tears
often
ran
down
my
cheeks
and
moistened
my
pillow
when
i
had
not
an
hour
before
been
the
happiest
of
the
happy
and
the
gayest
of
the
gay
in
a
family
party
there
is
nothing
so
amusing
as
any
little
talent
out
of
the
general
way
and
my
performances
and
tricks
on
cards
etcetera
in
which
melchior
had
made
me
such
an
adept
were
now
brought
forward
as
a
source
of
innocent
gratification
when
i
quitted
i
had
a
general
and
hearty
welcome
to
the
house
from
the
parents
and
the
eyes
of
the
amiable
girls
as
well
as
mine
were
not
exactly
dry
as
we
bade
each
other
farewell
you
told
your
father
harcourt
did
you
not
yes
and
the
whole
of
them
japhet
and
you
must
acknowledge
that
in
their
estimation
you
did
not
suffer
my
father
is
pleased
with
our
intimacy
and
advises
me
to
cultivate
it
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
anxious
so
to
do
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
i
know
your
house
as
well
as
you
do
and
that
you
have
reserved
only
the
first
floor
for
yourself
but
there
are
two
good
rooms
on
the
first
floor
and
you
can
dispense
with
a
suppose
we
club
together
it
will
be
a
saving
to
us
both
as
poor
carbonnell
said
when
he
took
you
in
with
all
my
heart
i
am
delighted
with
the
proposal
harcourt
then
stated
what
it
was
his
intention
to
offer
for
his
share
of
the
apartment
the
other
expenses
to
be
divided
and
his
servant
dismissed
i
hardly
need
say
that
we
did
not
disagree
and
before
i
had
been
a
week
in
town
we
were
living
together
my
interview
with
mr
masterton
and
subsequent
events
had
made
me
forget
to
call
on
the
governors
of
the
foundling
hospital
to
ascertain
whether
there
had
been
any
inquiries
after
me
on
my
return
to
town
i
went
there
and
finding
that
there
was
a
meeting
to
be
held
on
the
next
day
i
presented
myself
i
was
introduced
into
the
room
where
they
were
assembled
you
wish
to
speak
with
the
governors
of
the
hospital
i
understand
said
the
presiding
governor
yes
sir
replied
i
i
have
come
to
ask
whether
an
inquiry
has
been
made
after
one
of
the
inmates
of
this
charity
of
the
name
of
japhet

newland
if
you
recollect
sir
he
was
bound
to
an
apothecary
of
the
name
of
cophagus
in
consequence
of
some
money
which
was
left
with
him
as
an
infant
enclosed
in
a
letter
in
which
it
was
said
that
he
would
be
reclaimed
if
circumstances
permitted
i
recollect
it
perfectly
well
it
is
now
about
six
years
back
i
think
there
was
some
inquiry
was
there
not
mr
g
i
think
that
there
was
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
but
we
will
send
for
the
secretary
and
refer
to
the
minutes
my
heart
beat
quick
and
the
perspiration
bedewed
my
forehead
when
i
heard
this
intelligence
at
last
my
emotion
was
so
great
that
i
felt
faint
you
are
ill
sir
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
quick
a
glass
of
water
the
attendant
brought
a
glass
of
water
which
i
drank
and
recovered
myself
you
appear
to
be
much
interested
in
this
young
man
welfare
i
am
sir
replied
i
no
one
can
be
more
so
the
secretary
now
made
his
appearance
with
the
register
and
after
turning
over
the
leaves
read
as
follows
august
the
a
gentleman
came
to
inquire
after
an
infant
left
here
of
the
name
of
japhet
with
whom
money
had
been
deposited
japhet
christened
by
order
of
the
governors
japhet
newland
referred
to
the
shop
of
mr
cophagus
smithfield
market
he
returned
the
next
day
saying
that
mr
cophagus
had
retired
from
business
that
the
parties
in
the
shop
knew
nothing
for
certain
but
believed
that
the
said
japhet
newland
had
been
transported
for
life
for
forgery
about
a
year
before
good
heavens
what
an
infamous
assertion
exclaimed
i
clasping
my
hands
on
reference
back
to
the
calendar
we
observed
that
one
newland
was
transported
for
such
an
offence
query
it
must
have
been
some
other
person
but
this
has
arisen
from
the
vindictive
feeling
of
those
two
scoundrels
who
served
under
pleggit
cried
i
how
can
you
possibly
tell
sir
mildly
observed
one
of
the
governors
how
can
i
tell
sir
replied
i
starting
from
my
chair
why
i
am
myself
sir
you
sir
replied
the
governor
surveying
my
fashionable
exterior
my
chains
and
bijouterie
yes
sir
i
am
the
japhet
newland
brought
up
in
the
asylum
and
who
was
apprenticed
to
mr
cophagus
probably
then
sir
replied
the
president
you
are
the
mr
newland
whose
name
appears
at
all
the
fashionable
parties
in
high
life
i
believe
that
i
am
the
same
person
sir
i
wish
you
joy
upon
your
success
in
the
world
sir
it
would
not
appear
that
it
can
be
very
important
to
you
to
discover
your
parents
sir
replied
i
you
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
feel
the
want
of
parents
and
friends
fortunate
as
you
may
consider
me
to
be
and
i
acknowledge
i
have
every
reason
to
be
grateful
for
my
unexpected
rise
in
life
i
would
at
this
moment
give
up
all
that
i
am
worth
resume
my
foundling
dress
and
be
turned
out
a
beggar
if
i
could
but
discover
the
authors
of
my
existence
i
then
bowed
low
to
the
governors
and
quitted
the
room
part
two
chapter
fourteen
mischief
brewing
timothy
and
i
set
our
wits
to
work
and
he
resumes
his
old
profession
of
a
gipsy
i
hastened
home
with
feelings
too
painful
to
be
described
i
had
a
soreness
at
my
heart
an
oppression
on
my
spirits
which
weighed
me
down
i
had
but
one
wish
that
i
was
dead
i
had
already
imparted
to
harcourt
the
history
of
my
life
and
when
i
came
in
i
threw
myself
upon
the
sofa
in
despair
and
relieved
my
agonised
heart
with
a
flood
of
tears
as
soon
as
i
could
compose
myself
i
stated
what
had
occurred
my
dear
newland
although
it
has
been
an
unfortunate
occurrence
in
itself
i
do
not
see
that
you
have
so
much
cause
to
grieve
for
you
have
this
satisfaction
that
it
appears
there
has
been
a
wish
to
reclaim
you
yes
replied
i
i
grant
that
but
have
they
not
been
told
and
have
they
not
believed
that
i
have
been
ignominiously
punished
for
a
capital
crime
will
they
ever
seek
me
more
probably
not
you
must
now
seek
them
what
i
should
recommend
is
that
you
repair
to
the
apothecary
shop
and
interrogate
relative
to
the
person
who
called
to
make
inquiries
after
you
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
go
with
you
and
be
insulted
by
those
malignant
scoundrels
they
dare
not
insult
you
as
an
apothecary
apprentice
they
would
but
as
a
gentleman
they
will
quail
and
if
they
do
not
their
master
will
most
certainly
be
civil
and
give
you
all
the
information
which
he
can
we
may
as
well
however
not
do
things
by
halves
i
will
borrow
my
aunt
carriage
for
the
morning
and
we
will
go
in
style
i
think
i
will
call
this
evening
upon
mr
masterton
and
ask
his
advice
ask
him
to
accompany
us
newland
and
he
will
frighten
them
with
libel
and
defamation
of
character
i
called
upon
mr
masterton
that
evening
and
told
my
story
it
is
indeed
very
provoking
newland
but
keep
your
courage
up
i
will
go
with
you
and
will
see
what
we
can
make
of
it
at
what
time
do
you
propose
to
start
will
it
suit
you
sir
if
we
call
at
one
yes
so
good
night
my
boy
for
i
have
something
here
which
i
must
contrive
to
get
through
before
that
time
harcourt
had
procured
the
carriage
and
we
picked
up
masterton
at
the
hour
agreed
and
proceeded
to
smithfield
when
we
drove
up
to
the
door
of
mr
pleggit
shop
the
assistants
at
first
imagined
that
it
was
a
mistake
few
handsome
carriages
are
to
be
seen
stopping
in
this
quarter
of
the
metropolis
we
descended
and
entered
the
shop
mr
masterton
inquiring
if
mr
pleggit
was
at
home
the
shopmen
who
had
not
recognised
me
bowed
to
the
ground
in
their
awkward
way
and
one
ran
to
call
mr
pleggit
who
was
up
stairs
mr
pleggit
descended
and
we
walked
into
the
back
parlour
mr
masterton
then
told
him
the
object
of
our
calling
and
requested
to
know
why
the
gentleman
who
had
inquired
after
me
had
been
sent
away
with
the
infamous
fabrication
that
i
had
been
transported
for
forgery
mr
pleggit
protested
innocence
recollected
however
that
a
person
had
called
would
make
every
inquiry
of
his
shopmen
the
head
man
was
called
in
and
interrogated
at
first
he
appeared
to
make
a
joke
of
it
but
when
threatened
by
mr
masterton
became
humble
acknowledged
that
they
had
said
that
i
was
transported
for
they
had
read
it
in
the
newspapers
was
sorry
for
the
mistake
said
that
the
gentleman
was
a
very
tall
person
very
very
much
of
a
gentleman
could
not
recollect
his
exact
dress
was
a
large
built
man
with
a
stern
face
but
seemed
very
much
agitated
when
he
heard
that
i
had
been
transported
called
twice
mr
pleggit
was
not
in
at
first
left
his
name
thinks
the
name
was
put
down
on
the
when
he
called
a
second
time
mr
pleggit
was
at
home
and
referred
him
to
them
not
knowing
what
had
become
of
me
the
other
shopman
was
examined
and
his
evidence
proved
similar
to
that
of
the
first
the
was
sent
for
and
the
day
in
august
referred
to
there
was
a
name
written
down
on
the
side
of
the
page
which
the
shopman
said
he
had
no
doubt
indeed
he
could
almost
swear
was
the
gentleman
name
as
there
was
no
other
name
put
down
on
that
day
the
name
as
taken
down
was
this
was
all
the
information
we
could
obtain
and
we
then
quitted
the
shop
and
drove
off
without
there
being
any
recognition
of
me
on
the
part
of
mr
pleggit
and
his
assistants
i
never
heard
that
name
before
observed
harcourt
to
mr
masterton
it
is
in
all
probability
de
benyon
replied
the
lawyer
we
must
make
allowances
for
their
ignorance
at
all
events
this
is
a
sort
of
clue
to
follow
up
the
de
benyons
are
irish
then
i
will
set
off
for
ireland
morning
sir
said
i
you
will
do
no
such
thing
replied
the
lawyer
but
you
will
call
upon
me
evening
and
perhaps
i
may
have
something
to
say
to
you
i
did
not
fail
to
attend
mr
masterton
who
stated
that
he
had
made
every
inquiry
relative
to
the
de
benyons
as
he
had
said
they
were
an
irish
family
of
the
highest
rank
and
holding
the
peerage
of
de
beauvoir
but
that
he
had
written
to
his
agent
in
dublin
giving
him
directions
to
obtain
for
him
every
possible
information
in
his
power
relative
to
all
the
individuals
composing
it
till
this
had
been
received
all
that
i
could
do
was
to
remain
quiet
i
then
narrated
to
him
the
behaviour
of
the
agent
mr
iving
to
timothy
there
is
some
mystery
there
most
assuredly
observed
mr
masterton
when
do
you
go
again
to
i
replied
that
it
was
not
my
intention
to
go
there
for
some
time
unless
he
would
wish
to
see
the
little
girl
i
do
newland
i
think
i
must
take
her
under
my
protection
as
well
as
you
we
will
go
down
sunday
is
the
only
day
i
can
spare
but
it
must
be
put
down
as
a
work
of
charity
the
next
day
we
went
down
to
fleta
was
surprised
to
see
me
so
soon
and
mr
masterton
was
much
struck
with
the
elegance
and
classical
features
of
my
little
protegee
he
asked
her
many
questions
and
with
his
legal
tact
contrived
to
draw
from
her
many
little
points
relative
to
her
infant
days
which
she
had
till
he
put
his
probing
questions
quite
forgotten
as
we
returned
to
town
he
observed
you
are
right
japhet
that
is
no
child
of
humble
origin
her
very
appearance
contradicts
it
but
we
have
i
think
a
chance
of
discovering
who
she
is
a
better
one
i
afraid
than
at
present
we
have
for
your
identification
but
never
mind
let
us
trust
to
perseverance
for
three
weeks
i
continued
to
live
with
harcourt
but
i
did
not
go
out
much
such
was
the
state
of
my
affairs
when
timothy
came
to
my
room
one
morning
and
said
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
observed
it
sir
but
there
is
a
man
constantly
lurking
about
here
watching
the
house
i
believe
i
think
but
still
i
not
quite
sure
that
i
have
seen
his
face
before
but
where
i
can
not
recollect
indeed
what
sort
of
a
person
may
he
be
he
is
a
very
dark
man
stout
and
well
made
and
is
dressed
in
a
sort
of
dress
such
as
you
see
put
on
by
those
who
belong
to
the
funny
clubs
on
the
river
but
he
is
not
at
all
a
gentleman
himself
quite
the
contrary
it
is
now
about
a
week
that
i
have
seen
him
every
day
and
i
have
watched
him
and
perceive
that
he
generally
follows
you
as
soon
as
you
go
out
well
replied
i
we
must
find
out
what
he
wants
if
we
can
point
him
out
to
me
i
will
soon
see
if
he
is
tracing
my
steps
timothy
pointed
him
out
to
me
after
breakfast
i
could
not
recollect
the
face
and
yet
it
appeared
that
i
had
seen
it
before
i
went
out
and
after
passing
half
a
dozen
streets
i
turned
round
and
perceived
that
the
man
was
dodging
me
i
took
no
notice
but
being
resolved
to
try
him
again
i
walked
to
the
white
horse
cellar
and
took
a
seat
inside
a
brentford
coach
about
to
start
on
my
arrival
at
brentford
i
got
out
and
perceived
that
the
man
was
on
the
roof
of
a
sudden
it
flashed
on
my
memory
it
was
the
gipsy
who
had
come
to
the
camp
with
the
communication
to
melchior
which
induced
him
to
quit
it
i
recollected
him
and
his
kneeling
down
by
the
stream
and
washing
his
face
the
mystery
was
solved
melchior
had
employed
him
to
find
out
the
residence
of
fleta
in
all
probability
they
had
applied
to
the
false
address
given
by
timothy
and
in
consequence
were
trying
by
watching
my
motions
to
find
out
the
true
one
you
shall
be
deceived
at
all
events
thought
i
as
i
walked
on
through
brentford
until
i
came
to
a
ladies
seminary
i
rang
the
bell
and
was
admitted
stating
my
wish
to
know
the
terms
of
the
school
for
a
young
lady
and
contrived
to
make
as
long
a
stay
as
i
could
promising
to
call
again
if
the
relatives
of
the
young
lady
were
as
satisfied
as
i
professed
to
be
on
my
quitting
the
house
i
perceived
that
my
gipsy
attendant
was
not
far
off
i
took
the
first
stage
back
and
returned
to
my
lodgings
when
i
had
told
all
that
had
occurred
to
timothy
he
replied
i
think
sir
that
if
you
could
replace
me
for
a
week
or
two
i
could
now
be
of
great
service
he
does
not
know
me
and
if
i
were
to
darken
my
face
and
put
on
a
proper
dress
i
think
i
should
have
no
difficulty
in
passing
myself
off
as
one
of
the
tribe
knowing
their
slang
and
having
been
so
much
with
them
but
what
good
do
you
anticipate
timothy
my
object
is
to
find
out
where
he
puts
up
and
to
take
the
same
quarters
make
his
acquaintance
and
find
out
who
melchior
is
and
where
he
lives
my
knowledge
of
him
and
nattee
may
perhaps
assist
me
you
must
be
careful
then
timothy
for
he
may
know
sufficient
of
our
history
to
suspect
you
let
me
alone
sir
do
you
like
my
proposal
yes
i
do
you
may
commence
your
arrangements
immediately
part
two
chapter
fifteen
i
set
off
on
a
chase
and
fall
in
with
an
old
friend
the
next
morning
timothy
had
procured
me
another
valet
and
throwing
off
his
liveries
made
his
appearance
in
the
evening
sending
up
to
say
a
man
wished
to
speak
to
me
he
was
dressed
in
boots
worsted
stockings
greasy
leather
small
clothes
a
shag
waistcoat
and
a
blue
frock
overall
his
face
was
stained
of
a
dark
olive
and
when
he
was
ushered
in
harcourt
who
was
sitting
at
table
with
me
had
not
the
slightest
recognition
of
him
as
harcourt
knew
all
my
secrets
i
had
confided
this
i
had
not
told
him
what
timothy
intentions
were
as
i
wished
to
ascertain
whether
his
disguise
was
complete
i
had
merely
said
i
had
given
timothy
leave
for
a
few
days
perhaps
you
may
wish
me
away
for
a
short
time
said
harcourt
looking
at
tim
not
at
all
my
dear
harcourt
why
should
i
there
nobody
here
but
you
and
timothy
timothy
excellent
upon
my
word
i
never
should
have
known
him
he
is
going
forth
on
his
adventures
and
if
you
please
sir
i
will
lose
no
time
it
is
now
dark
and
i
know
where
the
gipsy
hangs
out
success
attend
you
then
but
be
careful
tim
you
had
better
write
to
me
instead
of
calling
i
had
the
same
idea
and
now
i
wish
you
a
good
evening
when
timothy
quitted
the
room
i
explained
our
intentions
to
harcourt
yours
is
a
strange
adventurous
sort
of
life
newland
you
are
constantly
plotted
against
and
plotting
in
your
turn
mines
and
i
have
an
idea
that
you
will
turn
out
some
grand
personage
after
all
for
if
not
why
should
there
be
all
this
trouble
about
you
the
trouble
in
the
present
case
is
all
about
fleta
who
must
by
your
argument
turn
out
some
grand
personage
well
perhaps
she
may
i
should
like
to
see
that
little
girl
newland
that
can
not
be
just
now
for
reasons
you
well
know
but
some
other
time
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
on
the
second
day
after
tim
departure
i
received
a
letter
from
him
by
the
twopenny
post
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
gipsy
but
had
not
extracted
any
information
being
as
yet
afraid
to
venture
any
questions
he
further
stated
that
his
new
companion
had
no
objection
to
a
glass
or
two
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
if
he
could
contrive
to
make
him
tipsy
in
a
few
days
he
would
have
some
important
intelligence
to
communicate
i
was
in
a
state
of
great
mental
agitation
during
this
time
i
went
to
mr
masterton
and
narrated
to
him
all
that
had
passed
he
was
surprised
and
amused
and
desired
me
not
to
fail
to
let
him
have
the
earliest
intelligence
of
what
came
to
light
he
had
not
received
any
answer
as
yet
from
his
agent
in
dublin
it
was
not
until
eight
days
afterwards
that
i
received
further
communication
from
timothy
and
i
was
in
a
state
of
great
impatience
combined
with
anxiety
lest
any
accident
should
have
happened
his
communication
was
important
he
was
on
the
most
intimate
footing
with
the
man
who
had
proposed
that
he
should
assist
him
to
carry
off
a
little
girl
who
was
at
a
school
at
brentford
they
had
been
consulting
how
this
should
be
done
and
timothy
had
proposed
forging
a
letter
desiring
her
to
come
up
to
town
and
his
carrying
it
as
a
livery
servant
the
man
had
also
other
plans
one
of
which
was
to
obtain
an
entrance
into
the
house
by
making
acquaintance
with
the
servants
another
by
calling
to
his
aid
some
of
the
women
of
his
fraternity
to
tell
fortunes
nothing
was
as
yet
decided
but
that
he
was
resolved
to
obtain
possession
of
the
little
girl
even
if
he
were
obliged
to
resort
to
force
in
either
case
timothy
was
engaged
to
assist
when
i
read
this
i
more
than
congratulated
myself
upon
the
man
being
on
the
wrong
scent
and
that
timothy
had
hit
upon
his
scheme
timothy
continued
that
they
had
indulged
in
very
deep
potations
last
night
and
that
the
man
had
not
scrupled
to
say
that
he
was
employed
by
a
person
of
large
fortune
who
paid
well
and
whom
it
might
not
be
advisable
to
refuse
as
he
had
great
power
after
some
difficulty
he
asked
timothy
if
he
had
ever
heard
the
name
of
melchior
in
his
tribe
timothy
replied
that
he
had
and
that
at
the
gathering
he
had
seen
him
and
his
wife
timothy
at
one
time
thought
that
the
man
was
about
to
reveal
everything
but
of
a
sudden
he
stopped
short
and
gave
evasive
answers
to
a
question
put
by
timothy
as
to
where
they
were
to
take
the
child
if
they
obtained
possession
of
her
the
man
had
replied
that
she
would
go
over
the
water
such
were
the
contents
of
the
letter
and
i
eagerly
awaited
a
further
communication
the
next
day
i
called
at
long
hotel
upon
a
gentleman
with
whom
i
was
upon
intimate
terms
after
remaining
a
short
time
with
him
i
was
leaving
the
hotel
when
i
was
attracted
by
some
trunks
in
the
entrance
hall
i
started
when
i
read
the
address
of
a
de
benyon
esquire
to
be
left
at
f
t
hotel
dublin
i
asked
the
waiter
who
was
by
whether
mr
de
benyon
had
left
the
hotel
he
replied
that
he
had
left
it
in
his
own
carriage
that
morning
and
having
more
luggage
than
he
could
take
with
him
had
desired
these
trunks
to
be
forwarded
by
the
coach
i
had
by
that
time
resumed
my
serenity
i
took
out
a
memorandum
book
wrote
down
the
address
on
the
trunks
saying
that
i
was
sorry
not
to
have
seen
mr
de
benyon
and
that
i
would
write
to
him
but
if
i
composed
myself
before
the
waiter
how
did
my
heart
throb
as
i
hastily
passed
through
bond
street
to
my
home
i
had
made
up
my
mind
upon
what
very
slight
grounds
the
reader
must
be
aware
that
this
mr
de
benyon
either
must
be
my
father
or
if
not
was
able
to
tell
me
who
was
had
not
mr
masterton
said
that
there
was
a
clue
had
he
not
written
to
dublin
the
case
was
to
my
excited
imagination
as
clear
as
the
and
before
i
arrived
at
home
i
had
made
up
my
mind
in
what
manner
i
should
proceed
it
was
then
about
four
i
hastily
packed
up
my
portmanteau
took
with
me
all
my
ready
money
about
sixty
pounds
and
sent
the
servant
to
secure
a
place
in
the
mail
to
holyhead
he
returned
stating
that
there
was
a
seat
taken
for
me
i
waited
till
five
to
see
harcourt
but
he
did
not
come
home
i
then
wrote
him
a
short
note
telling
him
where
i
was
going
and
promising
to
write
as
soon
as
i
arrived
ireland
is
to
be
the
ground
of
my
future
adventures
my
dear
harcourt
call
upon
mr
masterton
and
tell
him
what
i
have
done
which
he
surely
will
approve
open
timothy
letters
and
let
me
have
their
contents
i
leave
you
to
arrange
and
act
for
me
in
every
respect
until
i
return
in
the
mean
time
believe
me
ever
yours
j
newland
i
gave
the
letter
to
the
valet
and
calling
a
coach
drove
to
the
office
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
afterwards
was
rolling
away
to
holyhead
felicitating
myself
upon
my
promptitude
and
decision
little
imagining
to
what
the
step
i
had
taken
was
to
lead
it
was
a
very
dark
night
in
november
when
i
started
on
my
expedition
there
were
three
other
passengers
in
the
mail
none
of
whom
had
yet
spoken
a
word
although
we
had
made
several
miles
of
our
journey
muffled
up
in
my
cloak
i
indulged
in
my
own
reveries
as
usual
building
up
castles
which
toppled
over
one
after
another
as
i
built
and
rebuilt
again
at
last
one
of
the
passengers
blew
his
nose
as
if
to
give
warning
that
he
was
about
to
speak
and
then
inquired
of
the
gentleman
next
him
if
he
had
seen
the
evening
newspapers
the
other
replied
in
the
negative
it
would
appear
that
ireland
is
not
in
a
very
quiet
state
sir
observed
the
first
did
you
ever
read
the
history
of
ireland
inquired
the
other
not
very
particularly
then
sir
if
you
were
to
take
that
trouble
you
will
find
that
ireland
since
it
was
first
peopled
never
has
been
in
a
quiet
state
nor
perhaps
ever
will
it
is
a
species
of
human
volcano
always
either
smoking
burning
or
breaking
out
into
eruptions
and
fire
true
sir
replied
the
other
i
am
told
the
white
boys
are
mustering
in
large
numbers
and
that
some
of
the
districts
are
quite
impassable
sir
if
you
had
travelled
much
in
ireland
you
would
have
found
out
that
many
of
the
districts
are
quite
impassable
without
the
impediment
of
the
white
boys
you
have
been
a
great
deal
in
ireland
then
sir
replied
the
other
yes
sir
said
the
other
with
a
consequential
air
i
believe
i
may
venture
to
say
that
i
am
in
charge
of
some
of
the
most
considerable
properties
in
ireland
lawyer
agent
five
per
cent
and
so
on
muttered
the
third
party
who
sate
by
me
and
had
not
yet
spoken
there
was
no
mistaking
him
it
was
my
former
master
mr
cophagus
and
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
very
well
pleased
at
this
intimation
of
his
presence
as
i
took
it
for
granted
that
he
would
recognise
me
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
the
conversation
continued
without
any
remarks
being
made
upon
this
interruption
on
the
part
of
mr
cophagus
the
agent
it
appeared
had
been
called
to
london
on
business
and
was
returning
the
other
was
a
professor
of
music
bound
to
dublin
on
speculation
what
called
mr
cophagus
in
that
direction
i
could
not
comprehend
but
i
thought
i
would
try
and
find
out
i
therefore
while
the
two
others
were
engaged
in
conversation
addressed
him
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
can
you
tell
me
sir
if
the
college
at
dublin
is
considered
good
for
the
instruction
of
surgical
pupils
country
good
at
all
events
plenty
of
practice
broken
heads
and
so
on
have
you
ever
been
in
ireland
sir
ireland
never
do
wish
to
go
must
go
old
women
will
die
executor
botheration
and
so
on
i
hope
she
has
left
you
a
good
legacy
sir
replied
i
legacy
humph
ca
tell
silver
suit
of
black
and
so
on
long
journey
wo
pay
ca
be
helped
old
women
always
troublesome
alive
or
dead
bury
her
come
back
and
so
on
part
two
chapter
sixteen
i
deny
my
master
although
mr
cophagus
was
very
communicative
in
his
own
way
he
had
no
curiosity
with
regard
to
others
and
the
conversation
dropped
the
other
two
had
also
asked
all
the
questions
which
they
wished
and
we
all
as
if
by
one
agreement
fell
back
in
our
seats
and
shut
our
eyes
to
court
sleep
i
was
the
only
one
who
wooed
it
in
vain
day
broke
my
companions
were
all
in
repose
and
i
discontinued
my
reveries
and
examined
their
physiognomies
mr
cophagus
was
the
first
to
whom
i
directed
my
attention
he
was
much
the
same
in
face
as
when
i
had
left
him
but
considerably
thinner
in
person
his
head
was
covered
with
a
white
nightcap
and
he
snored
with
emphasis
the
professor
of
music
was
a
very
small
man
with
mustachios
his
mouth
was
wide
open
and
one
would
have
thought
that
he
was
in
the
full
execution
of
a
bravura
the
third
person
who
had
stated
himself
to
be
an
agent
was
a
heavy
personage
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
his
head
bent
down
on
his
chest
and
i
observed
that
he
had
a
small
packet
in
one
of
his
hands
with
his
forefinger
twisted
through
the
string
i
should
not
have
taken
further
notice
had
not
the
name
of
in
the
corner
of
the
side
on
which
was
the
direction
attracted
my
attention
it
was
the
name
of
melchior
london
correspondent
who
had
attempted
to
bribe
timothy
this
induced
me
to
look
down
and
read
the
direction
of
the
packet
and
i
clearly
deciphered
sir
henry
de
clare
mount
castle
connemara
i
took
out
my
tablets
and
wrote
down
the
address
i
certainly
had
no
reason
for
so
doing
except
that
nothing
should
be
neglected
as
there
was
no
saying
what
might
turn
out
i
had
hardly
replaced
my
tablets
when
the
party
awoke
made
a
sort
of
snatch
at
the
packet
as
if
recollecting
it
and
wishing
to
ascertain
if
it
were
safe
looked
at
it
took
off
his
hat
let
down
the
window
and
then
looked
round
upon
the
other
parties
fine
morning
sir
said
he
to
me
perceiving
that
i
was
the
only
person
awake
very
replied
i
very
fine
but
i
had
rather
be
walking
over
the
mountains
of
connemara
than
be
shut
up
in
this
close
and
confined
conveyance
hah
you
know
connemara
then
i
going
there
perhaps
you
are
also
bound
to
that
part
of
the
country
but
you
are
not
irish
i
was
not
born
or
bred
in
ireland
certainly
replied
i
so
i
should
say
irish
blood
in
your
veins
i
presume
i
believe
such
to
be
the
case
replied
i
with
a
smile
implying
certainty
do
you
know
sir
henry
de
clare
sir
henry
de
clare
of
mount
castle
is
he
not
the
same
i
am
going
over
to
him
i
am
agent
for
his
estates
among
others
a
very
remarkable
man
have
you
ever
seen
his
wife
i
really
can
not
tell
replied
i
let
me
call
to
mind
i
had
somehow
or
another
formed
an
idea
that
sir
henry
de
clare
and
melchior
might
be
one
and
the
same
person
nothing
was
too
absurd
or
improbable
for
my
imagination
and
i
had
now
means
of
bringing
home
my
suspicions
i
think
continued
i
i
recollect
her
that
is
she
is
a
very
tall
handsome
woman
dark
eyes
and
complexion
the
very
same
replied
he
my
heart
bounded
at
the
information
it
certainly
was
not
any
clue
to
my
own
parentage
but
it
was
an
object
of
my
solicitude
and
connected
with
the
welfare
of
fleta
if
i
recollect
right
observed
i
there
are
some
curious
passages
in
the
life
of
sir
henry
nothing
very
particular
observed
the
agent
looking
out
of
the
window
i
thought
that
he
had
disappeared
for
some
time
disappeared
he
certainly
did
not
live
in
ireland
because
he
had
quarrelled
with
his
brother
he
lived
in
england
until
his
death
how
did
his
brother
die
sir
killed
by
a
fall
when
hunting
replied
the
agent
he
was
attempting
to
clear
a
stone
wall
the
horse
fell
back
on
him
and
dislocated
his
spine
i
was
on
the
spot
when
the
accident
happened
i
recollected
the
imperfect
communication
of
fleta
who
had
heard
the
gipsy
say
that
he
was
dead
and
also
the
word
made
use
of
and
i
now
felt
convinced
that
i
had
found
out
melchior
sir
henry
if
i
recollect
right
has
no
family
observed
i
no
and
i
am
afraid
there
is
but
little
chance
had
the
late
baronet
his
elder
brother
any
family
what
sir
william
no
or
sir
henry
would
not
have
come
into
the
title
he
might
have
had
daughters
replied
i
very
true
now
i
think
of
it
there
was
a
girl
who
died
when
young
is
the
widow
of
sir
william
alive
yes
and
a
very
fine
woman
she
is
but
she
has
left
ireland
since
her
husband
death
i
did
not
venture
to
ask
any
more
questions
our
conversation
had
roused
mr
cophagus
and
the
other
passenger
and
as
i
had
reflected
how
i
should
behave
in
case
of
recognition
i
wished
to
be
prepared
for
him
you
have
had
a
good
nap
sir
said
i
turning
to
him
nap
yes
coach
nap
bad
head
sore
and
so
on
why
bless
me
japhet
japhet
new
yes
it
is
do
you
speak
to
me
sir
inquired
i
with
a
quiet
air
speak
to
you
yes
bad
memory
hip
quite
forgot
old
master
shop
in
smithfield
mad
bull
and
so
on
really
sir
replied
i
i
am
afraid
you
mistake
me
for
some
other
person
mr
cophagus
looked
very
hard
at
me
and
perceiving
that
there
was
no
alteration
in
my
countenance
exclaimed
very
odd
same
nose
same
face
same
age
too
very
odd
like
as
two
pills
beg
pardon
made
a
mistake
and
so
on
satisfied
with
the
discomfiture
of
mr
cophagus
i
turned
round
when
i
perceived
the
irish
agent
with
whom
i
had
been
in
conversation
eyeing
me
most
attentively
as
i
said
before
he
was
a
man
and
his
small
grey
eye
was
now
fixed
upon
me
as
if
it
would
have
pierced
me
through
i
felt
confused
for
a
moment
as
the
scrutiny
was
unexpected
from
that
quarter
but
a
few
moments
reflection
told
me
that
if
sir
henry
de
clare
and
melchior
were
the
same
person
and
this
man
his
agent
in
all
probability
he
had
not
been
sent
to
england
for
nothing
that
if
he
was
in
search
of
fleta
he
must
have
heard
of
my
name
and
perhaps
something
of
my
history
i
appear
to
have
a
great
likeness
to
many
people
observed
i
to
the
agent
smiling
it
was
but
the
other
day
i
was
stopped
in
bond
street
as
a
mr
rawlinson
not
a
very
common
face
either
sir
observed
the
agent
if
once
seen
not
easily
forgotten
nor
easily
mistaken
for
another
still
such
appears
to
be
the
case
replied
i
carelessly
we
now
stopped
to
take
refreshment
i
had
risen
from
the
table
and
was
going
into
the
passage
when
i
perceived
the
agent
looking
over
the
with
the
guard
as
soon
as
he
perceived
me
he
walked
out
in
front
of
the
inn
before
the
guard
had
put
up
the
bill
i
requested
to
look
at
it
wishing
to
ascertain
if
i
had
been
booked
in
my
own
name
it
was
so
the
four
names
were
newland
cophagus
baltzi
mcdermott
i
was
much
annoyed
at
this
circumstance
mcdermott
was
of
course
the
name
of
the
agent
and
that
was
all
the
information
i
received
in
return
for
my
own
exposure
which
i
now
considered
certain
i
determined
however
to
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
and
when
we
returned
to
the
coach
again
entered
into
conversation
with
mr
mcdermott
but
i
found
him
particularly
guarded
in
his
replies
whenever
i
spoke
about
sir
henry
or
his
family
and
i
could
not
obtain
any
further
information
mr
cophagus
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
me
he
peered
into
my
face
then
he
would
fall
back
in
the
coach
odd
very
odd
must
be
no
says
not
um
in
about
another
half
hour
he
would
repeat
his
examination
and
mutter
to
himself
at
last
as
if
tormented
with
his
doubts
he
exclaimed
beg
pardon
but
you
have
a
name
yes
replied
i
i
have
a
name
well
then
not
ashamed
what
is
it
my
name
sir
replied
i
is
newland
for
i
had
resolved
to
acknowledge
to
my
name
and
fall
back
upon
a
new
line
of
defence
thought
so
do
know
me
do
recollect
shop
mr
brookes
tim
rudiments
and
so
on
i
have
not
the
least
objection
to
tell
you
my
name
but
i
am
afraid
you
have
the
advantage
in
your
recollection
of
me
where
may
i
have
had
the
honour
of
meeting
you
meeting
what
quite
forgot
smithfield
and
pray
sir
where
may
smithfield
be
very
odd
ca
comprehend
same
name
same
face
do
recollect
me
do
recollect
smithfield
it
may
be
very
odd
sir
but
as
i
am
very
well
known
in
london
at
the
west
end
perhaps
we
have
met
there
lord
windermear
perhaps
lady
maelstrom
and
i
continued
mentioning
about
a
dozen
of
the
most
fashionable
names
at
all
events
you
appear
to
have
the
advantage
of
me
but
i
trust
you
will
excuse
my
want
of
memory
as
my
acquaintance
is
very
extensive
i
see
quite
a
mistake
same
name
not
same
person
beg
pardon
sir
apologies
and
so
on
replied
the
apothecary
drawing
in
a
long
sigh
part
two
chapter
seventeen
i
turn
lawyer
i
watched
the
countenance
of
the
agent
who
appeared
at
last
to
be
satisfied
that
there
had
been
some
mistake
at
least
he
became
more
communicative
and
as
i
no
longer
put
any
questions
to
him
relative
to
sir
henry
we
had
a
long
conversation
i
spoke
to
him
about
the
de
benyons
making
every
inquiry
that
i
could
think
of
he
informed
me
that
the
deceased
earl
the
father
of
the
present
had
many
sons
who
were
some
of
them
married
and
that
the
family
was
extensive
he
appeared
to
know
them
all
the
professions
which
they
had
been
brought
up
to
and
their
careers
in
life
i
treasured
up
this
information
and
as
soon
as
i
had
an
opportunity
wrote
down
all
which
he
had
told
me
on
our
arrival
at
holyhead
the
weather
was
very
boisterous
and
the
packet
was
to
depart
immediately
mr
mcdermott
stated
his
intentions
to
go
over
but
mr
cophagus
and
the
professor
declined
and
anxious
as
i
was
to
proceed
i
did
not
wish
to
be
any
longer
in
company
with
the
agent
and
therefore
also
declined
going
on
board
mr
mcdermott
called
for
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
drank
it
off
in
haste
and
then
followed
by
the
porter
with
his
luggage
went
down
to
embark
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
well
mr
cophagus
acknowledge
that
it
is
possible
to
persuade
a
man
out
of
his
senses
you
knew
me
and
you
were
perfectly
right
in
asserting
that
i
was
japhet
yet
did
i
persuade
you
at
last
that
you
were
mistaken
but
i
will
explain
to
you
why
i
did
so
all
right
said
the
apothecary
taking
my
proffered
hand
thought
so
no
mistake
handsome
fellow
so
you
are
japhet
newland
my
apprentice
and
so
on
yes
sir
replied
i
laughing
i
am
japhet
newland
i
turned
round
hearing
a
noise
the
door
had
been
opened
and
mr
mcdermott
had
just
stepped
in
he
had
returned
for
an
umbrella
which
he
had
forgotten
he
looked
at
me
at
mr
cophagus
who
still
held
my
hand
in
his
turned
short
round
said
nothing
and
walked
out
this
is
unfortunate
observed
i
my
reason
for
not
avowing
myself
was
to
deceive
that
very
person
and
now
i
have
made
the
avowal
to
his
face
however
it
can
not
be
helped
i
sat
down
with
my
old
master
and
as
i
knew
that
i
could
confide
in
him
gave
him
an
outline
of
my
life
and
stated
my
present
intentions
i
see
japhet
i
see
done
mischief
sorry
for
it
ca
be
helped
do
all
i
can
um
what
to
be
done
be
your
friend
always
like
you
help
all
i
can
and
so
on
but
what
would
you
advise
sir
advice
bad
as
physic
nobody
takes
it
ireland
wild
place
no
law
better
go
back
leave
all
to
me
find
out
and
so
on
this
advice
i
certainly
did
not
consent
to
follow
we
argued
the
matter
over
for
some
time
and
then
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
proceed
together
i
was
informed
by
mr
cophagus
that
he
had
retired
with
a
very
handsome
fortune
and
was
living
in
the
country
about
ten
miles
from
the
metropolis
that
he
had
been
summoned
to
attend
the
funeral
of
a
maiden
aunt
in
dublin
who
had
left
him
executor
and
residuary
legatee
but
that
he
knew
nothing
of
her
circumstances
he
was
still
a
bachelor
and
amused
himself
in
giving
advice
and
medicines
gratis
to
the
poor
people
of
the
village
in
which
he
resided
there
being
no
resident
practitioner
within
some
distance
he
liked
the
country
very
much
but
there
was
one
objection
to
it
the
he
had
not
forgotten
the
at
a
very
late
hour
we
retired
to
our
beds
the
next
morning
the
weather
had
moderated
and
on
the
arrival
of
the
mail
we
embarked
and
had
a
very
good
passage
over
on
my
arrival
at
dublin
i
directed
my
steps
to
the
f
t
hotel
as
the
best
place
to
make
inquiries
relative
to
mr
de
benyon
mr
cophagus
also
put
up
at
the
same
hotel
and
we
agreed
to
share
a
waiter
said
i
do
you
know
a
mr
de
benyon
yes
sir
replied
he
there
is
one
of
the
de
benyons
at
the
hotel
at
this
moment
is
he
a
married
man
yes
with
a
large
family
what
is
his
christian
name
i
really
can
not
tell
sir
but
i
find
out
for
you
by
morning
when
does
he
leave
i
believe
do
you
know
where
he
goes
yes
sir
to
his
own
seat
the
waiter
left
the
room
wo
do
japhet
said
cophagus
large
family
do
want
more
hard
times
and
so
on
no
replied
i
it
does
not
exactly
answer
but
i
may
from
him
obtain
further
intelligence
wo
do
japhet
try
another
way
large
family
want
all
money
um
never
tell
good
night
this
remark
of
mr
cophagus
gave
me
an
idea
upon
which
i
proceeded
the
next
morning
i
sent
in
my
card
requesting
the
honour
of
speaking
to
mr
de
benyon
stating
that
i
had
come
over
to
ireland
on
business
of
importance
but
that
as
i
must
be
back
if
possible
by
term
time
it
would
perhaps
save
much
expense
and
trouble
the
waiter
took
in
the
message
back
by
term
time
it
must
be
some
legal
gentleman
show
him
up
said
mr
de
benyon
i
walked
in
with
a
air
mr
de
benyon
i
believe
yes
sir
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
take
a
chair
i
seated
myself
and
drew
out
my
memorandum
book
my
object
mr
de
benyon
in
troubling
you
is
to
ascertain
a
few
particulars
relative
to
your
family
which
we
can
not
so
easily
find
out
in
england
there
is
a
which
it
is
supposed
may
be
claimed
by
one
of
the
de
benyons
but
which
we
can
not
ascertain
until
we
have
a
little
search
into
the
genealogical
tree
is
the
property
large
inquired
mr
de
benyon
not
very
large
replied
i
but
still
a
very
handsome
property
i
am
told
the
reader
may
surmise
that
the
property
referred
to
was
my
own
pretty
self
may
i
ask
you
a
few
particulars
relative
to
the
present
earl
and
his
brothers
most
certainly
sir
replied
mr
de
benyon
any
information
i
can
give
you
will
be
at
your
service
the
earl
has
four
brothers
the
eldest
maurice
is
he
married
yes
and
has
two
children
the
next
is
william
is
he
married
no
nor
has
he
ever
been
he
is
a
general
in
the
army
the
third
is
myself
henry
you
are
married
i
believe
sir
yes
with
a
large
family
may
i
request
you
will
proceed
sir
arthur
is
the
fourth
brother
he
is
lately
married
and
has
two
children
sir
i
feel
much
obliged
to
you
it
is
a
curious
and
intricate
affair
as
i
am
here
i
may
as
well
ask
one
question
although
not
of
great
consequence
the
earl
is
married
i
perceive
by
the
peerage
but
i
do
not
find
that
he
has
any
children
on
the
contrary
he
has
two
and
prospects
of
more
may
i
now
request
the
particulars
connected
with
this
property
the
exact
particulars
sir
i
can
not
well
tell
you
as
i
am
not
acquainted
with
them
myself
but
the
property
in
question
i
rather
think
depends
upon
a
may
i
venture
to
ask
the
names
of
all
your
children
mr
de
benyon
gave
me
a
list
which
i
put
down
with
great
gravity
of
course
there
is
no
doubt
of
your
second
brother
not
being
married
i
believe
we
ought
to
have
a
certificate
do
you
know
his
address
he
has
been
in
the
east
indies
for
many
years
he
returned
home
on
furlough
and
has
now
just
sailed
again
for
calcutta
that
is
unfortunate
we
must
forward
a
letter
through
the
india
board
may
i
also
be
favoured
with
your
address
as
in
all
probability
it
may
be
advisable
mr
de
benyon
gave
me
his
address
i
rose
promised
to
give
him
all
the
particulars
as
soon
as
they
were
known
to
me
bowed
and
made
my
exit
to
one
who
was
in
his
sober
senses
there
certainly
was
not
any
important
information
gained
but
to
me
it
was
evident
that
the
mr
de
benyon
who
was
a
general
in
the
army
was
to
be
interrogated
and
i
had
almost
made
up
my
mind
to
set
off
for
calcutta
part
two
chapter
eighteen
i
affront
an
irish
gentleman
and
make
a
handsome
apology
which
is
accepted
before
i
had
gained
my
own
room
i
informed
mr
cophagus
who
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
his
maiden
aunt
house
of
what
had
passed
ca
see
anything
in
it
japhet
chase
who
told
you
oh
pleggit
men
sad
liars
de
benyon
not
name
depend
upon
it
all
stuff
and
so
on
and
when
i
reflected
i
could
but
acknowledge
that
the
worthy
apothecary
might
be
right
and
that
i
was
running
after
shadows
but
this
was
only
in
my
occasional
fits
of
despondency
i
soon
rallied
and
was
as
sanguine
as
ever
undecided
how
to
proceed
and
annoyed
by
what
cophagus
had
said
i
quitted
the
hotel
to
walk
out
in
no
very
good
humour
as
i
went
out
i
perceived
the
agent
mcdermott
speaking
to
the
people
in
the
bar
and
the
sight
of
him
reminded
me
of
what
for
a
moment
i
had
forgotten
which
was
to
ascertain
whether
melchior
and
sir
henry
de
clare
were
one
and
the
same
person
as
i
passed
a
crossing
a
man
in
tattered
habiliments
who
was
sweeping
it
asked
for
alms
but
being
in
no
very
charitable
humour
i
walked
on
he
followed
me
pestering
me
so
much
that
i
gave
him
a
tap
with
the
cane
in
my
hand
saying
to
him
be
off
you
scoundrel
oh
very
well
be
off
is
it
you
mane
by
the
blood
of
the
but
you
answer
for
that
same
anyhow
i
passed
on
and
having
perambulated
the
city
of
dublin
for
some
time
returned
to
the
hotel
a
few
minutes
afterwards
i
was
told
by
the
waiter
that
a
mr
wished
to
speak
to
me
i
have
not
the
honour
of
his
acquaintance
replied
i
but
you
may
show
him
up
mr
entered
a
tall
personage
in
a
dress
evidently
not
made
for
him
a
pair
of
white
cotton
gloves
and
a
small
stick
i
believe
that
i
have
the
honour
of
spaking
to
the
gentleman
who
crossed
over
the
street
about
two
hours
ago
upon
my
word
sir
replied
i
that
is
so
uncertain
a
definition
that
i
can
hardly
pretend
to
say
whether
i
am
the
person
you
mean
indeed
from
not
having
the
pleasure
of
anyone
acquaintance
in
dublin
i
rather
think
there
must
be
some
mistake
the
devil
a
bit
of
a
mistake
at
all
at
all
for
there
the
little
bit
of
a
cane
with
which
you
paid
my
friend
mr
the
compliment
over
his
shoulders
i
really
am
quite
mystified
sir
and
do
not
understand
you
will
you
favour
me
with
an
explanation
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
for
then
we
shall
come
to
a
right
understanding
you
were
crossing
the
street
and
a
gentleman
a
particular
friend
of
mine
with
a
broom
which
he
carries
for
his
own
amusement
did
himself
the
honour
to
address
you
whereupon
of
that
same
little
stick
of
yours
you
did
him
the
honour
to
give
him
a
slight
taste
what
do
you
mean
do
you
refer
to
the
sweeper
who
was
so
importunate
when
i
crossed
over
the
road
then
by
the
powers
you
just
hit
it
as
you
did
him
that
my
particular
friend
thaddeus
gentleman
gentleman
exclaimed
i
and
with
as
good
and
as
true
milesian
blood
as
any
in
ireland
if
you
think
sir
that
because
my
friend
just
for
his
own
amusement
thinks
proper
to
put
on
the
worst
of
his
clothes
and
carry
a
broom
just
by
way
of
exercise
to
prevent
his
becoming
too
lusty
he
is
therefore
to
be
struck
like
a
hound
it
a
slight
mistake
that
all
and
here
sir
is
his
card
and
you
will
oblige
me
by
mentioning
any
friend
of
yours
with
whom
i
may
settle
all
the
little
points
necessary
before
the
meeting
of
two
gentleman
i
could
hardly
refrain
from
laughing
at
this
irish
gentleman
and
his
friend
but
i
thought
it
advisable
to
retain
my
countenance
my
dear
sir
replied
i
it
grieves
me
to
the
heart
that
i
should
have
committed
such
an
error
in
not
perceiving
the
gentility
of
your
friend
had
i
not
been
so
careless
i
certainly
should
have
requested
him
to
do
me
the
honour
to
accept
a
shilling
instead
of
having
offered
him
the
insult
i
hope
it
is
not
now
too
late
by
the
powers
i
not
one
of
those
sort
who
would
make
up
a
fight
when
there
no
occasion
for
it
and
as
your
is
that
of
a
gentleman
i
think
it
will
perhaps
be
better
to
shake
hands
upon
it
and
forget
it
altogether
suppose
now
we
consider
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
you
give
the
shilling
as
you
intended
to
do
i
swear
only
you
were
in
so
great
a
hurry
and
then
perhaps
you
not
object
to
throw
in
another
shilling
for
that
same
tap
with
the
cane
just
to
wipe
off
the
insult
as
it
were
as
we
do
our
sins
when
we
fork
out
the
money
and
receive
absolution
from
the
padre
and
then
perhaps
you
will
not
think
it
too
much
if
i
charge
another
shilling
for
my
time
and
trouble
for
carrying
a
message
between
two
gentlemen
on
the
contrary
mr
i
think
all
your
demands
are
reasonable
here
is
the
money
mr
took
the
three
shillings
then
sir
and
many
thanks
to
you
i
wish
you
a
good
evening
and
mr
shall
know
from
me
that
you
have
absolution
for
the
whole
and
that
you
have
offered
every
satisfaction
which
one
gentleman
could
expect
from
another
so
saying
mr
put
his
hat
on
with
a
firm
cock
pulled
on
his
gloves
manoeuvred
his
stick
and
with
a
flourishing
bow
took
his
departure
i
had
hardly
dismissed
this
gentleman
and
was
laughing
to
myself
at
the
ridiculous
occurrence
when
mr
cophagus
returned
first
putting
his
cane
up
to
his
nose
with
an
arch
look
and
then
laying
it
down
on
the
table
and
rubbing
his
hands
good
warm
old
lady
no
dead
and
cold
but
left
some
thousands
only
one
legacy
old
tom
cat
physic
him
soon
die
and
so
on
on
a
more
full
explanation
i
found
that
the
old
lady
had
left
about
nine
thousand
pounds
in
the
funds
and
bank
securities
all
of
which
with
the
exception
of
twenty
pounds
per
annum
to
a
favourite
cat
was
left
to
mr
cophagus
i
congratulated
him
upon
this
accession
of
fortune
he
stated
that
the
lease
of
the
house
and
the
furniture
were
still
to
be
disposed
of
and
that
afterwards
he
should
have
nothing
more
to
do
but
he
wished
me
very
much
to
assist
him
in
rummaging
over
the
various
cabinets
belonging
to
the
old
lady
and
which
were
full
of
secret
drawers
that
in
one
cabinet
alone
he
had
found
upwards
of
fifty
pounds
in
various
gold
coins
and
that
if
not
well
examined
they
would
probably
be
sold
with
many
articles
of
consequence
remaining
in
them
as
my
only
object
in
ireland
was
to
find
out
sir
henry
de
clare
and
identify
him
but
really
why
i
could
not
have
said
as
it
would
have
proved
nothing
after
all
i
willingly
consented
to
devote
a
day
to
assist
mr
cophagus
in
his
examination
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
we
went
together
to
the
house
of
the
old
lady
whose
name
had
been
maitland
as
mr
cophagus
informed
me
her
furniture
was
of
the
most
ancient
description
and
in
every
room
in
the
house
there
was
an
ormolu
or
japan
cabinet
some
of
them
were
very
handsome
decorated
with
pillars
and
silver
ornaments
i
can
hardly
recount
the
variety
of
articles
which
in
all
probability
had
been
amassed
during
the
whole
of
the
old
lady
life
commencing
with
her
years
of
childhood
and
ending
with
the
day
of
her
death
there
were
antique
ornaments
some
of
considerable
value
miniatures
fans
etuis
notes
of
which
the
ink
from
time
had
turned
to
a
light
red
packages
of
letters
of
her
various
correspondents
in
her
days
of
hope
and
anticipation
down
to
those
of
solitude
and
age
we
looked
over
some
of
them
but
they
appeared
to
both
of
us
to
be
sacred
and
they
were
after
a
slight
examination
committed
to
the
flames
after
we
had
examined
all
the
apparent
receptacles
in
these
cabinets
we
took
them
up
between
us
and
shook
them
and
in
most
cases
found
out
that
there
were
secret
drawers
containing
other
treasures
there
was
one
packet
of
letters
which
caught
my
eye
it
was
from
a
miss
de
benyon
i
seized
it
immediately
and
showed
the
inscription
to
mr
cophagus
pooh
nothing
at
all
her
mother
was
a
de
benyon
have
you
any
objection
to
my
looking
at
these
letters
no
read
nothing
in
them
i
laid
them
on
one
side
and
we
proceeded
in
our
search
when
mr
cophagus
took
up
a
sealed
packet
heh
what
this
de
benyon
again
japhet
look
here
i
took
the
packet
it
was
seated
and
tied
with
red
tape
papers
belonging
to
lieutenant
william
de
benyon
to
be
returned
to
him
at
my
decease
alice
maitland
great
was
written
at
the
bottom
of
the
envelope
this
is
it
my
dear
sir
cried
i
jumping
up
and
embracing
mr
cophagus
these
are
the
papers
which
i
require
may
i
keep
them
mad
quite
mad
go
to
bedlam
strait
waistcoat
head
shaved
and
so
on
part
two
chapter
nineteen
i
am
not
content
with
minding
my
own
business
but
must
have
a
hand
in
that
of
others
by
which
means
i
put
my
foot
in
it
he
then
after
his
own
fashion
told
me
that
as
executor
he
must
retain
those
papers
pointed
out
to
me
the
little
probability
there
was
of
their
containing
any
information
relative
to
my
birth
even
allowing
that
a
person
of
the
name
of
de
benyon
did
call
at
the
foundling
to
ask
for
me
which
was
only
a
supposition
and
finally
overthrew
all
the
hopes
which
had
been
for
so
many
days
buoying
me
up
when
he
had
finished
i
threw
myself
upon
the
sofa
in
despair
and
wished
at
the
moment
that
i
had
never
been
born
still
hope
again
rose
uppermost
and
i
would
have
given
all
i
possessed
to
have
been
able
to
break
open
the
seals
of
that
packet
and
have
read
the
contents
at
one
moment
i
was
so
frantic
that
i
was
debating
whether
i
should
not
take
them
from
mr
cophagus
by
force
and
run
off
with
them
at
last
i
rose
and
commenced
reading
the
letters
which
i
had
put
aside
but
there
was
nothing
in
them
but
the
trifling
communications
of
two
young
women
who
mentioned
what
was
amusing
to
them
but
uninteresting
to
those
who
were
not
acquainted
with
the
parties
when
we
had
finished
mr
cophagus
collected
all
together
and
putting
them
into
a
box
we
returned
in
a
coach
to
the
hotel
the
next
day
mr
cophagus
had
completed
all
his
arrangements
and
the
day
following
had
determined
to
return
to
england
i
walked
with
him
down
to
the
vessel
and
watched
it
for
an
hour
after
it
had
sailed
for
it
bore
away
a
packet
of
papers
which
i
could
not
help
imagining
were
to
discover
the
secret
which
i
was
so
eager
in
pursuit
of
a
night
sleep
made
me
more
rational
and
i
now
resolved
to
ascertain
where
sir
henry
de
clare
or
melchior
as
i
felt
certain
he
must
be
was
to
be
found
i
sent
for
the
waiter
and
asked
him
if
he
could
inform
me
he
immediately
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
gave
his
address
mount
castle
connemara
asking
me
when
i
intended
to
set
out
it
did
not
strike
me
till
afterwards
that
it
was
singular
that
he
should
be
so
well
acquainted
with
the
address
and
that
he
should
have
produced
a
card
with
it
written
upon
it
or
moreover
that
he
should
know
that
it
was
my
intention
to
go
there
i
took
the
address
and
desired
that
i
might
have
horses
ready
very
early
the
next
morning
i
then
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
harcourt
informing
him
of
my
proceedings
also
one
to
mr
masterton
much
more
explicit
lastly
to
timothy
to
the
care
of
harcourt
requesting
him
to
let
me
know
what
had
occurred
between
him
and
the
gipsies
after
dinner
i
packed
up
ready
for
my
journey
and
having
settled
my
bill
i
was
not
sorry
to
retire
to
my
bed
at
daylight
i
was
as
i
requested
called
by
the
waiter
and
taking
with
me
only
a
very
small
portmanteau
having
left
the
rest
of
my
effects
in
the
charge
of
the
people
who
kept
the
hotel
i
set
off
in
a
on
my
expedition
i
was
soon
clear
of
the
city
and
on
a
fine
smooth
road
and
as
i
threw
myself
back
in
the
corner
of
the
chaise
i
could
not
help
asking
myself
the
question
what
was
the
purport
of
my
journey
as
the
reader
will
perceive
i
was
wholly
governed
by
impulses
and
never
allowed
reason
or
common
sense
to
stand
in
the
way
of
my
feelings
what
have
i
to
do
replied
i
to
myself
to
find
out
if
melchior
and
sir
henry
de
clare
be
not
one
and
the
same
person
and
what
then
what
then
why
then
i
may
find
out
something
relative
to
fleta
parentage
nay
but
is
that
likely
if
as
you
suppose
melchior
is
sir
henry
de
clare
if
as
you
suppose
it
is
he
who
is
now
trying
to
find
out
and
carry
off
fleta
is
it
probable
that
you
will
gain
any
information
from
him
i
have
no
idea
that
fleta
is
the
little
girl
said
to
have
died
who
was
the
child
of
his
elder
brother
why
so
what
interest
could
melchior
have
in
stealing
his
own
niece
that
i
can
not
tell
why
did
nattee
give
me
the
necklace
i
can
not
tell
she
would
hardly
betray
her
husband
at
all
events
there
is
a
mystery
and
it
can
only
be
unravelled
by
being
pulled
at
and
i
may
learn
something
by
meeting
melchior
whereas
i
shall
learn
nothing
by
remaining
quiet
this
last
idea
satisfied
me
and
for
many
hours
i
remained
in
a
train
of
deep
thought
only
checked
by
paying
for
the
horses
at
the
end
of
every
stage
it
was
now
past
twelve
when
i
found
that
it
was
necessary
to
change
the
chaise
at
every
post
the
country
also
as
well
as
the
roads
had
changed
much
for
the
worse
cultivation
was
not
so
great
the
roads
were
mountainous
and
civilisation
generally
disappeared
it
was
nearly
dark
when
i
arrived
at
the
last
post
from
whence
i
was
to
take
horses
to
mount
castle
as
usual
the
chaise
also
was
to
be
changed
and
i
could
not
help
observing
that
each
change
was
from
bad
to
worse
rope
harness
was
used
and
the
vehicles
themselves
were
of
the
most
crazy
condition
still
i
had
travelled
very
fairly
for
an
irish
postilion
knows
how
to
make
an
irish
horse
go
very
fair
pace
i
descended
from
the
chaise
and
ordered
another
out
immediately
to
this
there
was
no
reply
except
wait
your
honour
step
in
a
moment
and
rest
from
your
fatigue
a
little
presuming
this
was
merely
to
give
them
time
to
get
ready
i
walked
into
the
room
of
the
inn
which
indeed
was
very
little
better
than
a
hovel
and
sat
down
by
the
turf
fire
in
company
with
some
others
whom
i
could
hardly
distinguish
for
smoke
i
paid
the
chaise
and
postilion
and
soon
afterwards
heard
it
drive
off
on
its
way
back
after
a
few
minutes
i
inquired
if
the
chaise
was
getting
ready
is
it
the
chaise
your
honour
means
said
the
landlady
yes
replied
i
a
chaise
on
to
mount
castle
then
i
am
sorry
that
your
honour
must
wait
a
little
for
our
chaise
and
the
only
one
which
we
have
is
gone
to
the
castle
and
wo
be
back
till
long
after
the
moon
is
up
what
will
your
honour
please
to
take
not
back
till
moonlight
replied
i
why
did
you
not
say
so
and
i
would
have
gone
on
with
the
other
is
it
with
the
other
you
mane
your
honour
then
if
teddy
driscoll
could
make
his
horses
go
one
step
farther
than
our
door
may
i
never
have
a
soul
to
be
saved
will
your
honour
please
to
sit
in
the
little
room
kathleen
shall
light
a
fire
vexed
as
i
was
with
the
idea
of
passing
the
night
in
this
horrid
place
there
was
no
help
for
it
so
i
took
up
my
portmanteau
and
followed
the
landlady
to
a
small
room
if
it
deserved
the
appellation
which
had
been
built
after
the
cottage
and
a
door
broken
through
the
wall
into
it
ceiling
there
was
none
it
had
only
rafters
with
tiles
overhead
i
took
a
seat
on
the
only
stool
that
was
in
the
room
and
leant
my
elbow
on
the
table
in
no
very
pleasant
humour
when
i
heard
the
girl
say
and
why
do
you
let
him
go
on
to
the
castle
sure
the
chaise
is
in
the
yard
and
the
horses
are
in
the
stable
there
orders
it
kathleen
replied
the
landlady
mr
mcdermott
was
here
this
blessed
day
and
who
can
deny
him
who
is
he
then
replied
the
girl
an
attorney
with
a
warrant
against
sir
henry
and
moreover
they
say
that
he
coming
to
upon
the
cattle
of
jerry
for
the
tithes
he
a
bould
young
chap
at
all
events
replied
the
girl
to
come
here
all
by
himself
oh
but
it
not
till
morning
and
then
we
have
the
troops
here
to
assist
him
and
does
jerry
know
of
this
sure
enough
he
does
and
i
hope
there
be
no
murder
committed
in
my
house
this
blessed
night
but
what
can
a
poor
widow
do
when
mcdermott
holds
up
his
finger
now
go
light
the
fire
kathleen
and
see
if
the
poor
young
man
wants
anything
it
a
burning
pity
that
he
have
something
to
comfort
him
before
his
misfortunes
fall
upon
him
kathleen
made
no
reply
the
horror
that
i
felt
at
this
discourse
may
easily
be
imagined
that
it
was
intended
that
i
should
meet
with
foul
play
was
certain
and
i
knew
very
well
that
in
such
a
desolate
part
of
the
country
the
murder
of
an
individual
totally
unknown
would
hardly
be
noticed
that
i
had
been
held
up
to
the
resentment
of
the
inhabitants
as
a
tithe
collector
and
an
attorney
with
a
warrant
was
quite
sufficient
i
felt
conscious
to
induce
them
to
make
away
with
me
how
to
undeceive
them
was
the
difficulty
part
two
chapter
twenty
no
hopes
of
rising
next
morning
alive
at
a
last
chance
i
get
into
bed
kathleen
came
in
with
fuel
to
light
the
fire
and
looking
rather
hard
at
me
passed
by
and
was
soon
busy
blowing
up
the
turf
she
was
a
very
handsome
girl
about
nineteen
years
of
age
stout
and
well
made
what
is
your
name
said
i
kathleen
at
your
service
sir
listen
to
me
kathleen
said
i
in
a
low
voice
you
are
a
woman
and
all
women
are
i
have
overheard
all
that
passed
between
your
mistress
and
you
and
that
mcdermott
has
stated
that
i
am
a
tithe
collector
and
an
attorney
with
a
warrant
i
am
no
such
thing
i
am
a
gentleman
who
wish
to
speak
to
sir
henry
de
clare
on
a
business
which
he
does
not
like
to
be
spoken
to
about
and
to
shew
you
what
i
say
is
the
truth
it
is
about
the
daughter
of
his
elder
brother
who
was
killed
when
hunting
and
who
is
supposed
to
be
dead
i
am
the
only
evidence
to
the
contrary
and
therefore
he
and
mcdermott
have
spread
this
report
that
i
may
come
to
harm
is
she
alive
then
replied
kathleen
looking
up
to
me
with
wonder
yes
and
i
will
not
tell
sir
henry
where
she
is
and
that
is
the
reason
of
their
enmity
but
i
saw
her
body
replied
the
girl
in
a
low
voice
standing
up
and
coming
close
to
me
it
was
not
hers
depend
upon
it
replied
i
hardly
knowing
what
to
answer
to
this
assertion
at
all
events
it
was
dressed
in
her
clothes
but
it
was
so
long
before
it
was
discovered
that
we
could
make
nothing
of
the
features
well
i
knew
the
poor
little
thing
for
my
mother
nursed
her
i
was
myself
brought
up
at
the
castle
and
lived
there
till
after
sir
william
was
killed
then
we
were
all
sent
away
kathleen
kathleen
cried
the
landlady
call
for
everything
you
can
think
of
one
after
another
whispered
kathleen
leaving
the
room
i
can
not
make
the
peat
burn
said
she
to
the
landlady
after
she
had
quitted
the
little
room
and
the
gentleman
wants
some
whisky
go
out
then
and
get
some
from
the
middle
of
the
stack
kathleen
and
be
quick
we
have
others
to
attend
besides
the
tithe
proctor
the
all
come
in
and
your
own
corny
is
with
them
my
corny
indeed
replied
kathleen
he
not
quite
so
sure
of
that
in
a
short
time
kathleen
returned
and
brought
some
dry
peat
and
a
measure
of
whisky
if
what
you
say
is
true
said
kathleen
and
sure
enough
you
no
irish
and
very
young
for
a
tithe
proctor
who
must
grow
old
before
he
can
be
such
a
villain
you
are
in
no
very
pleasant
way
the
are
here
and
i
an
idea
they
mean
no
good
for
they
sit
with
all
their
heads
together
whispering
to
each
other
and
all
their
shillelaghs
by
their
sides
tell
me
kathleen
was
the
daughter
of
sir
william
a
girl
to
be
sure
she
was
replied
kathleen
and
like
a
little
mountain
fairy
now
kathleen
tell
me
if
you
recollect
if
the
little
girl
or
her
mother
ever
wore
a
necklace
of
red
beads
mixed
with
gold
yes
that
my
lady
did
and
it
was
on
the
child
neck
when
it
was
lost
and
when
the
body
was
found
it
was
not
with
it
well
i
recollect
that
for
my
mother
said
the
child
must
have
been
drowned
or
murdered
for
the
sake
of
the
gold
beads
then
you
have
proved
all
i
wished
kathleen
and
now
i
tell
you
that
this
little
girl
is
alive
and
that
i
can
produce
the
necklace
which
was
lost
with
her
and
more
that
she
was
taken
away
by
sir
henry
himself
merciful
jesus
replied
kathleen
the
dear
little
child
that
we
cried
over
so
much
but
now
kathleen
i
have
told
you
this
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
not
what
mcdermott
has
asserted
no
doubt
with
the
intention
that
my
brains
shall
be
knocked
out
this
night
and
so
they
will
sure
enough
replied
kathleen
if
you
do
not
escape
but
how
am
i
to
escape
and
will
you
assist
me
and
i
laid
down
on
the
table
ten
guineas
from
my
purse
take
that
kathleen
and
it
will
help
you
and
corny
now
will
you
assist
me
it
corny
that
will
be
the
first
to
knock
your
brains
out
replied
kathleen
unless
i
can
stop
him
i
must
go
now
and
i
see
what
can
be
done
kathleen
would
have
departed
without
touching
the
gold
but
i
caught
her
by
the
wrist
collected
it
and
put
it
into
her
hand
that
not
like
a
tithe
proctor
at
all
events
replied
kathleen
but
my
heart
aches
and
my
head
swims
and
what
to
be
done
i
know
not
so
saying
kathleen
quitted
the
room
well
thought
i
after
she
had
left
the
room
at
all
events
i
have
not
been
on
a
wrong
scent
this
time
kathleen
has
proved
to
me
that
fleta
is
the
daughter
of
the
late
sir
william
and
if
i
escape
this
snare
melchior
shall
do
her
justice
pleased
with
my
having
so
identified
melchior
and
fleta
i
fell
into
a
train
of
thought
and
for
the
first
time
forgot
my
perilous
situation
but
i
was
roused
from
my
meditations
by
an
exclamation
from
kathleen
no
no
corny
nor
any
of
ye
not
now
and
mother
and
me
to
witness
it
it
shall
not
be
corny
hear
me
as
sure
as
blood
drawn
and
we
up
to
see
it
so
sure
does
corny
never
touch
this
hand
of
mine
a
pause
and
whispering
followed
and
again
all
appeared
to
be
quiet
i
unstrapped
my
portmanteau
took
out
my
pistols
which
were
loaded
them
and
remained
quiet
determined
to
sell
my
life
as
dearly
as
possible
it
was
more
than
half
an
hour
before
kathleen
returned
she
looked
pale
and
agitated
keep
quiet
and
do
not
think
of
resistance
said
she
it
is
useless
i
have
told
my
mother
all
and
she
believes
you
and
will
risk
her
life
to
save
him
who
has
watched
over
the
little
girl
whom
she
nursed
but
keep
quiet
we
shall
soon
have
them
all
out
of
the
house
corny
dare
not
disobey
me
and
he
will
persuade
the
others
she
then
went
out
again
and
did
not
return
for
nearly
an
hour
when
she
was
accompanied
by
her
mother
kathleen
has
told
me
all
young
sir
said
she
and
do
what
we
can
we
will
but
we
hardly
know
what
to
do
to
go
to
the
castle
would
be
madness
yes
replied
i
but
can
not
you
give
me
one
of
your
horses
to
return
the
way
i
came
that
was
our
intention
but
i
find
that
the
have
taken
them
all
out
of
the
stable
to
prevent
me
and
the
house
is
watched
they
will
come
at
midnight
and
attack
us
that
i
fully
expect
and
how
to
conceal
you
puzzles
my
poor
head
if
they
come
we
can
but
persuade
them
that
he
has
escaped
replied
kathleen
they
will
no
longer
watch
the
house
and
he
will
then
have
some
chance
there
is
but
one
chance
replied
the
mother
who
took
kathleen
aside
and
whispered
to
her
kathleen
coloured
to
the
forehead
and
made
no
reply
if
your
mother
bids
you
kathleen
there
can
be
no
harm
yes
but
if
corny
was
he
dare
not
replied
the
mother
and
now
put
this
light
out
and
do
you
get
into
bed
sir
with
your
clothes
on
they
led
me
to
a
small
a
miserable
affair
but
in
that
part
of
the
country
considered
respectable
lie
down
there
said
the
mother
and
wait
till
we
call
you
they
took
the
light
away
and
left
me
to
myself
and
my
own
reflections
which
were
anything
but
pleasant
i
lay
awake
it
might
be
for
two
hours
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
feet
and
then
a
whispering
under
the
window
and
shortly
afterwards
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
which
they
were
attempting
to
burst
open
every
moment
i
expected
that
it
would
yield
to
the
violence
which
was
made
use
of
when
the
mother
came
down
with
a
light
in
her
hand
hastened
to
me
and
desired
me
to
follow
her
i
did
so
and
before
she
left
my
room
she
threw
the
window
wide
open
she
led
me
up
a
sort
of
to
a
small
room
where
i
found
kathleen
sitting
up
in
her
bed
and
o
mother
mother
cried
kathleen
i
bid
ye
do
it
child
replied
the
mother
desiring
me
to
creep
into
her
daughter
bed
and
cover
myself
up
on
the
side
next
the
wall
let
me
put
on
more
clothes
mother
no
no
if
you
do
they
will
suspect
and
will
not
hesitate
to
search
your
mother
bids
you
the
poor
girl
was
burning
with
shame
and
confusion
nay
replied
i
if
kathleen
does
not
wish
it
i
will
not
buy
my
safety
at
the
expense
of
her
feelings
yes
yes
replied
kathleen
i
do
mind
now
those
words
of
yours
are
sufficient
come
in
quick
part
two
chapter
twenty
one
petticoat
interest
prevails
and
i
escape
but
i
put
my
head
into
the
lion
den
there
was
no
time
for
apology
and
stepping
over
kathleen
i
buried
myself
under
the
clothes
by
her
side
the
mother
then
hastened
down
stairs
and
arrived
at
the
door
just
as
they
had
succeeded
in
forcing
it
open
when
in
pounced
a
dozen
men
armed
with
their
faces
blackened
holy
jesus
what
is
it
that
you
want
screamed
the
landlady
the
blood
of
the
tithe
proctor
and
that
what
we
have
replied
the
not
in
my
house
not
in
my
house
cried
she
take
him
away
at
all
events
promise
me
to
take
him
away
so
we
will
honey
darlint
we
take
him
out
of
your
sight
and
out
of
your
hearing
too
only
show
us
where
he
may
be
he
sleeping
replied
the
mother
pointing
to
the
door
of
the
where
i
had
been
lying
down
the
party
took
the
light
from
her
hand
and
went
into
the
room
where
they
perceived
the
bed
empty
and
the
window
open
devil
a
bit
of
a
proctor
here
anyhow
cried
one
of
them
and
the
window
open
off
hurrah
my
lads
he
ca
be
far
by
the
powers
it
just
my
opinion
mrs
mcshane
replied
the
elder
that
he
not
quite
so
far
off
so
with
your
lave
or
by
your
lave
or
without
your
lave
we
just
have
a
look
over
the
premises
o
and
welcome
mister
jerry
if
you
think
i
the
woman
to
hide
a
proctor
look
everywhere
just
as
you
please
the
party
headed
by
jerry
who
had
taken
the
light
out
of
mrs
mcshane
hand
now
ascended
the
ladder
to
the
upper
storey
and
as
i
lay
by
kathleen
i
felt
that
she
trembled
with
fear
after
examining
every
nook
and
cranny
they
could
think
of
they
came
to
mrs
room
o
go
in
go
in
and
look
mr
it
a
very
likely
thing
to
insinuate
that
i
should
have
a
tithe
proctor
in
my
bed
search
pray
and
mrs
mcshane
led
the
way
into
her
own
room
every
part
had
been
examined
except
the
small
sleeping
room
of
kathleen
and
the
party
paused
before
the
door
we
must
search
observed
doggedly
search
my
daughter
very
well
search
if
you
please
it
a
fine
story
you
have
to
tell
how
six
great
men
pulled
a
poor
girl
out
of
her
bed
to
look
for
a
tithe
proctor
it
will
be
a
credit
to
you
anyhow
and
you
corny
you
stand
well
in
her
good
graces
when
you
come
to
talk
about
the
and
your
wife
that
is
to
be
pulled
out
of
her
bed
by
a
dozen
men
what
will
ye
say
to
kathleen
when
you
affront
her
by
supposing
that
a
maiden
girl
has
a
tithe
proctor
in
bed
with
her
d
think
that
ye
ever
have
the
mother
consent
or
blessing
no
one
goes
into
kathleen
room
cried
corny
roused
by
the
sarcasms
of
mrs
mcshane
yes
corny
replied
mrs
mcshane
it
not
for
a
woman
like
me
to
be
suspected
at
all
events
so
you
and
you
only
shall
go
into
the
room
if
that
will
content
ye
mr
jerry
yes
replied
the
party
and
mrs
mcshane
opened
the
door
kathleen
rose
up
on
her
elbow
holding
the
up
to
her
throat
and
looking
at
them
as
they
entered
said
o
corny
corny
this
to
me
corny
never
thought
of
looking
for
anybody
his
eyes
were
rivetted
upon
his
sweetheart
murder
kathleen
is
it
my
fault
jerry
will
have
it
are
you
satisfied
corny
said
mrs
mcshane
sure
enough
i
was
satisfied
before
i
came
in
that
kathleen
would
not
have
anyone
in
her
replied
corny
then
good
night
corny
and
it
that
i
talk
with
ye
replied
kathleen
mrs
mcshane
then
walked
out
of
the
room
expecting
corny
to
follow
but
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
he
came
to
the
bedside
fearful
that
if
he
put
his
arms
round
her
he
would
feel
me
kathleen
raised
herself
and
allowed
him
to
embrace
her
fortunately
the
light
was
not
in
the
room
or
i
should
have
been
discovered
as
in
so
doing
she
threw
the
clothes
off
my
head
and
shoulders
she
then
pushed
back
corny
from
her
and
he
left
the
room
shutting
the
door
after
him
the
party
descended
the
ladder
and
as
soon
as
kathleen
perceived
that
they
were
all
down
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
ran
into
her
mother
room
soon
after
i
heard
them
depart
mrs
mcshane
made
fast
the
door
and
came
up
stairs
she
first
went
to
her
own
room
where
poor
kathleen
was
crying
bitterly
from
shame
and
excitement
i
had
got
up
when
she
came
into
room
for
her
clothes
and
in
about
five
minutes
they
returned
together
i
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
bed
when
they
came
in
the
poor
girl
coloured
up
when
our
eyes
met
kathleen
said
i
you
have
in
all
probability
saved
my
life
and
i
can
not
express
my
thanks
i
am
only
sorry
that
your
modesty
has
been
put
to
so
severe
a
trial
if
corny
was
to
find
it
out
replied
kathleen
sobbing
again
how
could
i
do
such
a
thing
your
mother
bid
you
replied
mrs
mcshane
and
that
is
sufficient
but
what
must
you
think
of
me
sir
continued
kathleen
i
think
that
you
have
behaved
most
nobly
you
have
saved
an
innocent
man
at
the
risk
of
your
reputation
and
the
loss
of
your
lover
it
is
not
now
that
i
can
prove
my
gratitude
yes
yes
promise
me
by
all
that
sacred
that
you
never
mention
it
surely
you
would
not
ruin
one
who
has
tried
to
serve
you
i
promise
you
that
and
i
hope
to
perform
a
great
deal
more
replied
i
but
now
mrs
mcshane
what
is
to
be
done
remain
here
i
can
not
no
you
must
leave
and
that
very
soon
wait
about
ten
minutes
more
and
then
they
will
give
up
their
search
and
go
home
the
road
to
e
the
post
i
had
lately
come
from
is
the
best
you
can
take
and
you
must
travel
as
fast
as
you
can
for
there
is
no
safety
for
you
here
i
am
convinced
that
rascal
mcdermott
will
not
leave
me
till
he
has
rid
himself
of
me
i
then
took
out
my
purse
in
which
i
still
had
nearly
twenty
guineas
i
took
ten
of
them
mrs
mcshane
i
must
leave
you
in
charge
of
my
portmanteau
which
you
may
forward
when
you
hear
of
my
safety
if
i
should
not
be
so
fortunate
the
money
is
better
in
your
hands
than
in
the
hands
of
those
who
will
murder
me
kathleen
god
bless
you
you
are
a
good
girl
and
corny
will
be
a
happy
man
if
he
knows
your
value
i
then
wished
kathleen
and
she
allowed
me
to
kiss
her
without
any
resistance
but
the
tears
were
coursing
down
her
cheeks
as
i
left
the
room
with
her
mother
mrs
mcshane
looked
carefully
out
of
the
windows
holding
the
light
to
ascertain
if
there
was
anybody
near
and
satisfied
with
her
scrutiny
she
then
opened
the
door
and
calling
down
the
saints
to
protect
me
shook
hands
with
me
and
i
quitted
the
house
it
was
a
dark
cloudy
night
and
when
i
first
went
out
i
was
obliged
to
grope
for
i
could
distinguish
nothing
i
walked
along
with
a
pistol
loaded
in
each
hand
and
gained
as
i
thought
the
high
road
to
e
but
i
made
a
sad
mistake
and
puzzled
by
the
utter
darkness
and
turnings
i
took
on
the
contrary
the
road
to
mount
castle
as
soon
as
i
was
clear
of
the
houses
and
the
enclosure
there
was
more
light
and
i
could
distinguish
the
road
i
had
proceeded
about
four
or
five
miles
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
and
shortly
afterwards
two
men
rode
by
me
i
inquired
if
that
was
the
way
to
e
a
pause
ensued
and
a
whisper
all
right
replied
a
deep
voice
i
continued
my
way
glad
to
find
that
i
had
not
mistaken
it
and
cogitating
as
to
what
must
be
the
purpose
of
two
men
being
out
at
such
an
hour
about
ten
minutes
afterwards
i
thought
i
again
heard
the
sound
of
horses
feet
and
it
then
occurred
to
me
that
they
must
be
highwaymen
who
had
returned
to
rob
me
i
cocked
my
pistols
determined
to
sell
my
life
as
dearly
as
i
could
and
awaited
their
coming
up
with
anxiety
but
they
appeared
to
keep
at
the
same
distance
as
the
sound
did
not
increase
after
half
an
hour
i
came
to
two
roads
and
was
undecided
which
to
take
i
stopped
and
listened
the
steps
of
the
horses
were
no
longer
to
be
heard
i
looked
round
me
to
ascertain
if
i
could
recognise
any
object
so
as
to
decide
me
but
i
could
not
i
took
the
road
to
the
left
and
proceeded
until
i
arrived
at
a
brook
which
crossed
the
road
there
was
no
bridge
and
it
was
too
dark
to
perceive
the
stepping
stones
i
had
just
waded
about
half
way
across
when
i
received
a
blow
on
the
head
from
behind
which
staggered
me
i
turned
round
but
before
i
could
see
my
assailant
a
second
blow
laid
me
senseless
in
the
water
part
two
chapter
twenty
two
under
ground
but
not
yet
dead
and
buried
the
prospect
anything
but
pleasant
when
my
recollection
returned
i
found
myself
in
the
dark
but
where
i
knew
not
my
head
ached
and
my
brain
reeled
i
sat
up
for
a
moment
to
collect
my
senses
but
the
effort
was
too
painful
i
fell
back
and
remained
in
a
state
of
gradually
i
recovered
and
again
sat
up
i
perceived
that
i
had
been
lying
on
a
bed
of
straw
composed
of
two
or
three
trusses
apparently
i
felt
with
my
extended
arms
on
each
side
of
me
but
touched
nothing
i
opened
my
eyes
which
i
had
closed
again
and
tried
to
pierce
through
the
obscurity
but
in
vain
all
was
dark
as
erebus
i
then
rose
on
my
feet
and
extending
my
hands
before
me
walked
five
or
six
steps
on
one
side
till
i
was
clear
of
the
straw
and
came
to
a
wall
i
followed
the
wall
about
twenty
feet
and
then
touched
wood
groping
about
i
found
it
was
a
door
i
then
made
the
circuit
of
the
walls
and
discovered
that
the
other
side
was
built
with
bins
for
wine
which
were
empty
and
i
then
found
myself
again
at
the
straw
upon
which
i
had
been
laid
it
was
in
a
cellar
no
longer
used
but
where
again
i
lay
down
upon
the
straw
and
as
it
may
be
imagined
my
reflections
were
anything
but
pleasing
was
i
in
the
power
of
mcdermott
or
melchior
i
felt
convinced
that
i
was
but
my
head
was
too
painful
for
long
thought
and
after
half
an
reflection
i
gave
way
to
a
sullen
state
of
in
which
the
forms
of
mcdermott
kathleen
melchior
and
fleta
passed
in
succession
before
me
how
long
i
remained
in
this
second
species
of
trance
i
can
not
say
but
i
was
roused
by
the
light
of
a
candle
which
flashed
in
my
eyes
i
started
up
and
beheld
melchior
in
his
dress
just
as
when
i
had
taken
leave
of
him
it
is
to
you
then
that
i
am
indebted
for
this
treatment
replied
i
no
not
to
me
replied
melchior
i
do
not
command
here
but
i
knew
you
when
they
brought
you
in
insensible
and
being
employed
in
the
castle
i
have
taken
upon
myself
the
office
of
your
gaoler
that
i
might
if
possible
serve
you
i
felt
i
knew
this
to
be
false
but
a
moment
reflection
told
me
that
it
was
better
at
present
to
temporise
who
then
does
the
castle
belong
to
melchior
to
sir
henry
de
clare
and
what
can
be
his
object
in
treating
me
thus
that
i
can
tell
you
because
i
am
a
party
concerned
you
remember
the
little
girl
fleta
who
left
the
gipsy
camp
with
you
she
is
now
somewhere
under
your
care
well
i
grant
it
but
i
was
answerable
only
to
you
about
her
very
true
but
i
was
answerable
to
sir
henry
and
when
i
could
only
say
that
she
was
well
he
was
not
satisfied
for
family
reasons
now
make
him
very
anxious
that
she
should
return
to
him
and
indeed
it
will
be
for
her
advantage
as
she
will
in
all
probability
be
his
heir
for
he
has
satisfactorily
proved
that
she
is
a
near
relative
grant
all
that
melchior
but
why
did
not
sir
henry
de
clare
write
to
me
on
the
subject
and
state
his
wishes
and
his
right
to
demand
his
relative
and
why
does
he
treat
me
in
this
way
another
question
how
is
it
that
he
has
recognised
me
to
be
the
party
who
has
charge
of
the
little
girl
answer
me
those
questions
melchior
and
then
i
may
talk
over
the
matter
i
will
answer
the
last
question
first
he
knew
your
name
from
me
and
it
so
happened
that
a
friend
of
his
met
you
in
the
coach
as
you
were
coming
to
ireland
the
same
person
also
saw
you
at
the
and
gave
information
sir
henry
who
is
a
violent
man
and
here
has
almost
regal
sway
determined
to
detain
you
till
you
surrendered
up
the
child
you
recollect
that
you
refused
to
tell
his
agent
the
person
whose
address
i
gave
you
where
she
was
to
be
found
and
vexed
at
this
he
has
taken
the
law
into
his
own
hands
for
which
he
shall
smart
one
of
these
days
replied
i
if
there
is
law
in
this
country
there
is
a
law
in
england
but
very
little
and
none
that
will
harm
sir
henry
in
this
part
of
the
country
no
officer
would
venture
within
five
miles
of
the
castle
i
can
assure
you
for
he
knows
very
well
that
it
would
cost
him
his
life
and
sir
henry
never
quits
it
from
one
end
to
the
other
you
are
in
his
power
and
all
that
he
requires
is
information
where
the
child
may
be
found
and
an
order
for
her
being
delivered
to
him
you
can
not
object
to
this
as
he
is
her
nearest
relative
if
you
comply
i
do
not
doubt
but
sir
henry
will
make
you
full
amends
for
this
harsh
treatment
and
prove
a
sincere
friend
ever
afterwards
it
requires
consideration
replied
i
at
present
i
am
too
much
hurt
to
talk
i
was
afraid
so
replied
melchior
that
was
one
reason
why
i
obtained
leave
to
speak
to
you
wait
a
moment
melchior
then
put
the
candle
down
on
the
ground
went
out
and
turned
the
key
i
found
on
looking
round
that
i
was
right
in
my
conjectures
i
was
in
a
cellar
which
apparently
had
long
been
in
disuse
melchior
soon
returned
followed
by
an
old
crone
who
carried
a
basket
and
a
can
of
water
she
washed
the
blood
off
my
head
put
some
salve
upon
the
wounds
and
bound
them
up
she
then
went
away
leaving
the
basket
there
is
something
to
eat
and
drink
in
that
basket
observed
melchior
but
i
think
japhet
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
will
be
better
to
yield
to
the
wishes
of
sir
henry
and
not
remain
in
this
horrid
hole
very
true
melchior
replied
i
but
allow
me
to
ask
you
a
question
or
two
how
came
you
here
where
is
nattee
and
how
is
it
that
after
leaving
the
camp
i
find
you
so
reduced
in
circumstances
as
to
be
serving
such
a
man
as
sir
henry
de
clare
a
few
words
will
explain
that
replied
he
in
my
early
days
i
was
wild
and
i
am
to
tell
you
the
truth
in
the
power
of
this
man
nay
i
will
tell
you
honestly
my
life
is
in
his
power
he
ordered
me
to
come
and
i
dare
not
disobey
him
and
he
retains
me
here
and
nattee
is
quite
well
and
with
me
but
not
very
happy
in
her
present
situation
but
he
is
a
dangerous
violent
implacable
man
and
i
dare
not
disobey
him
i
advise
you
as
a
friend
to
consent
to
his
wishes
that
requires
some
deliberation
replied
i
and
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
are
to
be
driven
my
feelings
towards
sir
henry
after
this
treatment
are
not
the
most
amicable
besides
how
am
i
to
know
that
fleta
is
his
relative
well
i
can
say
no
more
japhet
i
wish
you
well
out
of
his
hands
you
have
the
power
to
help
me
if
that
is
the
case
said
i
i
dare
not
then
you
are
not
the
melchior
that
you
used
to
be
replied
i
we
must
submit
to
fate
i
must
not
stay
longer
you
will
find
all
that
you
want
in
the
basket
and
more
candles
if
you
do
not
like
being
in
the
dark
i
do
not
think
i
shall
be
permitted
to
come
again
till
melchior
then
went
out
locked
the
door
after
him
and
i
was
left
to
my
meditations
part
two
chapter
twenty
three
a
friend
in
need
is
a
friend
in
deed
the
tables
are
turned
and
so
is
the
key
the
issue
is
deep
tragedy
was
it
possible
that
which
melchior
said
was
true
a
little
reflection
told
me
that
it
was
all
false
and
that
he
was
himself
sir
henry
de
clare
i
was
in
his
power
and
what
might
be
the
result
he
might
detain
me
but
he
dare
not
murder
me
dare
not
my
heart
sank
when
i
considered
where
i
was
and
how
easy
would
it
be
for
him
to
despatch
me
if
so
inclined
without
anyone
ever
being
aware
of
my
fate
i
lighted
a
whole
candle
that
i
might
not
find
myself
in
the
dark
when
i
rose
and
exhausted
in
body
and
mind
was
soon
fast
asleep
i
must
have
slept
many
hours
for
when
i
awoke
i
was
in
darkness
the
candle
had
burnt
out
i
groped
for
the
basket
and
examined
the
contents
with
my
hands
and
found
a
i
struck
a
light
and
then
feeling
hungry
and
weak
refreshed
myself
with
the
eatables
it
contained
which
were
excellent
as
well
as
the
wine
i
had
replaced
the
remainder
when
the
key
again
turned
in
the
door
and
melchior
made
his
appearance
how
do
you
feel
japhet
replied
i
day
and
night
are
the
same
to
me
that
is
your
own
fault
replied
he
have
you
considered
what
i
proposed
to
you
yesterday
yes
replied
i
and
i
will
agree
to
this
let
sir
henry
give
me
my
liberty
come
over
to
england
prove
his
relationship
to
fleta
and
i
will
give
her
up
what
can
he
ask
for
more
he
will
hardly
consent
to
that
replied
melchior
for
once
in
england
you
will
take
a
warrant
out
against
him
no
on
my
honour
i
will
not
melchior
he
will
not
trust
to
that
then
he
must
judge
of
others
by
himself
replied
i
have
you
no
other
terms
to
propose
replied
melchior
none
then
i
will
carry
your
message
and
give
you
his
answer
melchior
then
brought
in
another
basket
and
took
away
the
former
and
did
not
make
his
appearance
till
the
next
day
i
now
had
recovered
my
strength
and
determined
to
take
some
decided
measures
but
how
to
act
i
knew
not
i
reflected
all
night
and
the
next
morning
that
is
according
to
my
supposition
i
attacked
the
basket
whether
it
was
that
ennui
or
weakness
occasioned
it
i
can
not
tell
but
either
way
i
drank
too
much
wine
and
was
ready
for
any
daring
deed
when
melchior
again
opened
the
door
sir
henry
will
not
accept
of
your
terms
i
thought
not
said
melchior
i
am
sorry
very
sorry
melchior
replied
i
starting
up
let
us
have
no
more
of
this
duplicity
i
am
not
quite
so
ignorant
as
you
suppose
i
know
who
fleta
is
and
who
you
are
indeed
replied
melchior
perhaps
you
will
explain
i
will
you
melchior
are
sir
henry
de
clare
you
succeeded
to
your
estates
by
the
death
of
your
elder
brother
from
a
fall
when
hunting
melchior
appeared
astonished
indeed
replied
he
pray
go
on
you
have
made
a
gentleman
of
me
no
rather
a
scoundrel
as
you
please
now
will
you
make
a
lady
of
fleta
yes
i
will
she
is
your
niece
melchior
started
back
your
agent
mcdermott
who
was
sent
over
to
find
out
fleta
abode
met
me
in
the
coach
and
he
has
tracked
me
here
and
risked
my
life
by
telling
the
people
that
i
was
a
tithe
proctor
your
information
is
very
important
replied
melchior
you
will
find
some
difficulty
to
prove
all
you
say
not
the
least
replied
i
flushed
with
anger
and
with
wine
i
have
proof
positive
i
have
seen
her
mother
and
i
can
identify
the
child
by
the
necklace
which
was
on
her
neck
when
you
stole
her
necklace
necklace
cried
melchior
yes
the
necklace
put
into
my
hands
by
your
own
wife
when
we
parted
damn
her
replied
melchior
do
not
damn
her
damn
yourself
for
your
villainy
and
its
being
brought
to
light
have
i
said
enough
or
shall
i
tell
you
more
pray
tell
me
more
no
i
will
not
for
i
must
commit
others
and
that
will
not
do
replied
i
for
i
felt
i
had
already
said
too
much
you
have
committed
yourself
at
all
events
replied
melchior
and
now
i
tell
you
that
until
never
mind
and
melchior
hastened
away
the
door
was
again
locked
and
i
was
once
more
alone
i
had
time
to
reflect
upon
my
imprudence
the
countenance
of
melchior
when
he
left
me
was
that
of
a
demon
something
told
me
to
prepare
for
death
and
i
was
not
wrong
the
next
day
melchior
came
not
nor
the
next
my
provisions
were
all
gone
i
had
nothing
but
a
little
wine
and
water
left
the
idea
struck
me
that
i
was
to
die
of
starvation
was
there
no
means
of
escape
none
i
had
no
weapon
no
tool
not
even
a
knife
i
had
expended
all
my
candles
at
last
it
occurred
to
me
that
although
i
was
in
a
cellar
my
voice
might
be
heard
and
i
resolved
as
a
last
effort
to
attempt
it
i
went
to
the
door
of
the
cellar
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
murder
murder
i
shouted
again
and
again
as
loud
as
i
could
until
i
was
exhausted
as
it
afterwards
appeared
this
plan
did
prevent
my
being
starved
to
death
for
such
was
melchior
villainous
intention
about
an
hour
afterwards
i
repeated
my
cries
of
murder
murder
and
they
were
heard
by
the
household
who
stated
to
melchior
that
there
was
someone
shouting
murder
in
the
vaults
below
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
i
repeated
my
cries
occasionally
i
was
now
quite
exhausted
i
had
been
nearly
two
days
without
food
and
my
wine
and
water
had
all
been
drunk
i
sat
down
with
a
parched
mouth
and
heated
brain
waiting
till
i
could
sufficiently
recover
my
voice
to
repeat
my
cries
when
i
heard
footsteps
approaching
the
key
was
again
turned
in
the
door
and
a
light
appeared
carried
by
one
of
two
men
armed
with
large
sledge
hammers
it
is
then
all
over
with
me
cried
i
and
i
never
shall
find
out
who
is
my
father
come
on
murderers
and
do
your
work
do
it
quickly
the
two
men
advanced
without
speaking
a
word
the
foremost
who
carried
the
lantern
laid
it
down
at
his
feet
and
raised
his
hammer
with
both
hands
when
the
other
behind
him
raised
his
weapon
and
the
foremost
fell
dead
his
feet
part
two
chapter
twenty
four
is
full
of
perilous
adventures
and
in
which
the
reader
may
be
assured
there
is
much
more
than
meets
the
eye
silence
said
a
voice
that
i
well
knew
although
his
face
was
completely
disguised
it
was
silence
japhet
again
whispered
timothy
there
is
yet
much
danger
but
i
will
save
you
or
die
take
the
hammer
melchior
is
waiting
outside
timothy
put
the
lantern
in
the
bin
so
as
to
render
it
more
dark
and
led
me
towards
the
door
whispering
when
he
comes
in
we
will
secure
him
melchior
soon
made
his
appearance
and
as
he
entered
the
cellar
is
it
all
right
said
he
going
up
to
timothy
and
passing
me
with
one
blow
i
felled
him
to
the
ground
and
he
lay
insensible
that
will
do
replied
timothy
now
we
must
be
off
not
till
he
takes
my
place
replied
i
as
i
shut
the
door
and
locked
it
now
he
may
learn
what
it
is
to
starve
to
death
i
then
followed
timothy
by
a
passage
which
led
outside
of
the
castle
through
which
he
and
his
companion
had
been
admitted
our
horses
are
close
by
said
timothy
for
we
stipulated
upon
leaving
the
country
after
it
was
done
it
was
just
dark
when
we
were
safe
out
of
the
castle
we
mounted
our
horses
and
set
off
with
all
speed
we
followed
the
high
road
to
the
post
town
to
which
i
had
been
conveyed
and
i
determined
to
pull
up
at
mrs
mcshane
for
i
was
so
exhausted
that
i
could
go
no
further
this
was
a
measure
which
required
precaution
and
as
there
was
moonlight
i
turned
off
the
road
before
i
entered
the
town
or
village
as
it
ought
to
have
been
called
so
that
we
dismounted
at
the
back
of
mrs
house
i
went
to
the
window
of
the
where
i
had
lain
down
and
tapped
gently
again
and
again
and
no
answer
at
last
kathleen
made
her
appearance
can
i
come
in
kathleen
said
i
i
am
almost
dead
with
fatigue
and
exhaustion
yes
replied
she
i
will
open
the
there
is
no
one
here
it
is
too
early
for
them
i
entered
followed
by
timothy
and
as
i
stepped
over
the
threshold
i
fainted
as
soon
as
i
recovered
mrs
mcshane
led
me
up
stairs
into
her
room
for
security
and
i
was
soon
able
to
take
the
refreshment
i
so
much
required
i
stated
what
had
passed
to
mrs
mcshane
and
kathleen
who
were
much
shocked
at
the
account
you
had
better
wait
till
it
is
late
before
you
go
on
said
mrs
mcshane
it
will
be
more
safe
it
is
now
nine
and
the
people
will
all
be
moving
till
eleven
i
will
give
your
horses
some
corn
and
when
you
are
five
miles
from
here
you
may
consider
yourselves
as
safe
holy
saints
what
an
escape
the
advice
was
too
good
not
to
be
followed
and
i
was
so
exhausted
that
i
was
glad
that
prudence
was
on
the
side
of
repose
i
lay
down
on
mrs
mcshane
bed
while
timothy
watched
over
me
i
had
a
short
slumber
and
then
was
awakened
by
the
good
landlady
who
told
me
that
it
was
time
for
us
to
quit
kathleen
then
came
up
to
me
and
said
i
would
ask
a
favour
of
you
sir
and
i
hope
you
will
not
refuse
it
kathleen
you
may
ask
anything
of
me
and
depend
upon
it
i
will
not
refuse
it
if
i
can
grant
it
then
sir
replied
the
good
girl
you
know
how
i
overcame
my
feelings
to
serve
you
will
you
overcome
yours
for
me
i
can
not
bear
the
idea
that
anyone
bad
as
he
may
be
of
the
family
who
have
reared
me
should
perish
in
so
miserable
a
manner
and
i
can
not
bear
that
any
man
bad
as
he
is
even
if
i
did
not
feel
obliged
to
to
him
should
die
so
full
of
guilt
and
without
absolution
will
you
let
me
have
the
key
that
sir
henry
de
clare
may
be
released
after
you
are
safe
and
away
i
know
he
does
not
deserve
any
kindness
from
you
but
it
is
a
horrid
death
and
a
horrid
thing
to
die
so
loaded
with
crime
kathleen
replied
i
i
will
keep
my
word
with
you
here
is
the
key
take
it
up
morning
and
give
it
to
lady
de
clare
tell
her
japhet
newland
sent
it
i
will
and
god
bless
you
sir
sir
said
mrs
mcshane
you
have
no
time
to
lose
god
bless
you
sir
said
kathleen
who
now
put
her
arms
round
me
and
kissed
me
we
mounted
our
horses
and
set
off
we
pressed
our
horses
or
rather
ponies
for
they
were
very
small
till
we
had
gained
about
six
miles
when
we
considered
that
we
were
comparatively
speaking
safe
and
then
drew
up
to
allow
them
to
recover
their
wind
i
was
very
much
exhausted
myself
and
hardly
spoke
one
word
until
we
arrived
at
the
next
post
town
when
we
found
everybody
in
bed
we
contrived
however
to
knock
them
up
and
timothy
having
seen
that
our
horses
were
put
into
the
stable
we
lay
down
till
the
next
morning
upon
a
bed
which
happened
to
be
unoccupied
sorry
as
were
the
accommodations
i
never
slept
so
soundly
and
woke
quite
refreshed
the
next
morning
i
stated
my
intention
of
posting
to
dublin
and
asked
tim
what
we
should
do
with
the
horses
they
belong
to
the
castle
replied
he
then
in
god
name
let
the
castle
have
them
for
i
wish
for
nothing
from
that
horrid
place
we
stated
to
the
landlord
that
the
horses
were
to
be
sent
back
and
that
the
man
who
took
them
would
be
paid
for
his
trouble
and
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
good
opportunity
of
writing
to
melchior
sir
henry
i
do
not
know
why
but
certainly
my
animosity
against
him
had
subsided
and
i
did
not
think
of
taking
legal
measures
against
him
i
thought
it
however
right
to
frighten
him
i
wrote
therefore
as
follows
sir
henry
i
send
you
back
your
horses
with
thanks
as
they
have
enabled
timothy
and
me
to
escape
from
your
clutches
your
reputation
and
your
life
now
are
in
my
power
and
i
will
have
ample
revenge
the
fact
of
your
intending
murder
will
be
fully
proved
by
my
friend
timothy
who
was
employed
by
you
in
disguise
and
accompanied
your
gipsy
you
can
not
escape
the
sentence
of
the
law
prepare
yourself
then
for
the
worst
as
it
is
not
my
intention
that
you
shall
escape
the
disgraceful
punishment
due
to
your
crimes
yours
japhet
newland
having
sealed
this
and
given
it
to
the
lad
who
was
to
return
with
the
horses
we
finished
our
breakfast
and
took
a
on
for
dublin
where
we
arrived
late
in
the
evening
during
our
journey
i
requested
timothy
to
narrate
what
had
passed
and
by
what
fortunate
chance
he
had
been
able
to
come
so
opportunely
to
my
rescue
if
you
recollect
japhet
replied
timothy
you
had
received
one
or
two
letters
from
me
relative
to
the
movements
of
the
gipsy
and
stating
his
intention
to
carry
off
the
little
girl
from
the
my
last
letter
in
which
i
had
informed
you
that
he
had
succeeded
in
gaining
an
entrance
into
the
ladies
school
at
brentford
could
not
have
reached
you
as
i
found
by
your
note
that
you
had
set
off
the
same
evening
the
gipsy
whom
i
only
knew
by
the
name
of
inquired
of
me
the
name
by
which
the
little
girl
was
known
and
my
answer
was
smith
as
i
took
it
for
granted
that
in
a
large
seminary
there
must
be
one
if
not
more
of
that
name
acting
upon
this
he
made
inquiries
of
the
to
whom
he
paid
his
addresses
and
made
very
handsome
presents
if
there
was
a
miss
smith
in
the
school
she
replied
that
there
were
two
one
a
young
lady
of
sixteen
and
the
other
about
twelve
years
old
of
course
the
one
selected
was
the
younger
will
had
seen
me
in
my
livery
and
his
plan
was
to
obtain
a
similar
one
hire
a
chariot
and
go
down
to
brentford
with
a
request
that
miss
smith
might
be
sent
up
with
him
immediately
as
you
were
so
ill
that
you
were
not
expected
to
live
but
previous
to
his
taking
this
step
he
wrote
to
melchior
requesting
his
orders
as
to
how
he
was
to
proceed
when
he
had
obtained
the
child
the
answer
from
melchior
arrived
by
this
time
he
had
discovered
that
you
were
in
ireland
and
intended
to
visit
him
perhaps
he
had
you
in
confinement
for
i
do
not
know
how
long
you
were
there
but
the
answer
desired
will
to
come
over
immediately
as
there
would
be
in
all
probability
work
for
him
that
would
be
well
paid
for
he
had
now
become
so
intimate
with
me
that
he
disguised
nothing
he
showed
me
the
letter
and
i
asked
him
what
it
meant
he
replied
that
there
was
somebody
to
put
out
of
the
way
that
was
clear
it
immediately
struck
me
that
you
must
be
the
person
if
such
was
the
case
and
i
volunteered
to
go
with
him
to
which
after
some
difficulty
he
consented
we
travelled
outside
the
mail
and
in
four
days
we
arrived
at
the
castle
will
went
up
to
melchior
who
told
him
what
it
was
that
he
required
will
consented
and
then
stated
he
had
another
hand
with
him
which
might
be
necessary
vouching
for
my
doing
anything
that
was
required
melchior
sent
for
me
and
i
certainly
was
afraid
that
he
would
discover
me
but
my
disguise
was
too
good
i
had
prepared
for
it
still
further
by
wearing
a
wig
of
light
hair
he
asked
me
some
questions
and
i
replied
in
a
surly
dogged
tone
which
satisfied
him
the
reward
was
two
hundred
pounds
to
be
shared
between
us
and
as
it
was
considered
advisable
that
we
should
not
be
seen
after
the
affair
was
over
by
the
people
about
the
place
we
had
the
horses
provided
for
us
the
rest
you
well
know
i
was
willing
to
make
sure
that
it
was
you
before
i
struck
the
scoundrel
and
the
first
glimpse
from
the
lantern
and
your
voice
convinced
me
thank
god
japhet
but
i
have
been
of
some
use
to
you
at
all
events
my
dear
tim
you
have
indeed
and
you
know
me
too
well
to
think
i
shall
ever
forget
it
but
now
i
must
first
ascertain
where
the
will
of
the
late
sir
william
is
to
be
found
we
can
read
it
for
a
shilling
and
then
i
may
discover
what
are
the
grounds
of
melchior
conduct
for
to
me
it
is
still
inexplicable
are
wills
made
in
ireland
registered
here
or
at
doctors
commons
in
london
in
dublin
i
should
imagine
but
on
my
arrival
at
dublin
i
felt
so
ill
that
i
was
obliged
to
retire
to
bed
and
before
morning
i
was
in
a
violent
fever
medical
assistance
was
sent
for
and
i
was
nursed
by
timothy
with
the
greatest
care
but
it
was
ten
days
before
i
could
quit
my
bed
for
the
first
time
i
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
by
the
fire
when
timothy
came
in
with
the
little
portmanteau
i
had
left
in
the
care
of
mrs
mcshane
open
it
timothy
said
i
and
see
if
there
be
anything
in
the
way
of
a
note
from
them
timothy
opened
the
portmanteau
and
produced
one
which
was
lying
on
the
top
it
was
from
kathleen
and
as
follows
dear
sir
they
say
there
is
terrible
work
at
the
castle
and
that
sir
henry
has
blown
out
his
brains
or
cut
his
throat
i
do
know
which
mr
mcdermott
passed
in
a
great
hurry
but
said
nothing
to
anybody
here
i
will
send
you
word
of
what
has
taken
place
as
soon
as
i
can
the
morning
after
you
went
away
i
walked
up
to
the
castle
and
gave
the
key
to
the
lady
who
appeared
in
a
great
fright
at
sir
henry
not
having
been
seen
for
so
long
a
while
they
wished
to
detain
me
after
they
had
found
him
in
the
cellar
with
the
dead
man
but
after
two
hours
i
was
desired
to
go
away
and
hold
my
tongue
it
was
after
the
horses
went
back
that
sir
henry
is
said
to
have
destroyed
himself
i
went
up
to
the
castle
but
mcdermott
had
given
orders
for
no
one
to
be
let
in
on
any
account
yours
kathleen
mcshane
this
is
news
indeed
said
i
handing
the
letter
to
timothy
it
must
have
been
my
threatening
letter
which
has
driven
him
to
this
mad
act
very
likely
replied
timothy
but
it
was
the
best
thing
the
scoundrel
could
do
after
all
the
letter
was
not
however
written
with
that
intention
i
wished
to
frighten
him
and
have
justice
done
to
little
fleta
poor
child
how
glad
i
shall
be
to
see
her
part
two
chapter
twenty
five
another
investigation
relative
to
a
child
which
in
the
same
way
as
the
former
one
ends
by
the
lady
going
off
in
a
fit
the
next
day
the
newspapers
contained
a
paragraph
in
which
sir
henry
de
clare
was
stated
to
have
committed
suicide
no
reason
could
be
assigned
for
this
rash
act
was
the
winding
up
of
the
intelligence
i
also
received
another
letter
from
kathleen
mcshane
confirming
the
previous
accounts
her
mother
had
been
sent
for
to
assist
in
laying
out
the
body
there
was
now
no
further
doubt
and
as
soon
as
i
could
venture
out
i
hastened
to
the
proper
office
where
i
read
the
will
of
the
late
sir
william
it
was
very
short
merely
disposing
of
his
personal
property
to
his
wife
and
a
few
legacies
for
as
i
discovered
only
a
small
portion
of
the
estates
were
entailed
with
the
title
and
the
remainder
was
not
only
to
the
heirs
male
but
the
eldest
female
should
there
be
no
male
heir
with
the
proviso
that
should
she
marry
the
husband
was
to
take
upon
himself
the
name
of
de
clare
here
then
was
the
mystery
explained
and
why
melchior
had
stolen
away
his
brother
child
satisfied
with
my
discovery
i
determined
to
leave
for
england
immediately
find
out
the
dowager
lady
de
clare
and
put
the
whole
case
into
the
hands
of
mr
masterton
fortunately
timothy
had
money
with
him
sufficient
to
pay
all
expenses
and
take
us
to
london
or
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
wait
for
remittances
as
mine
was
all
expended
before
i
arrived
at
dublin
we
arrived
safe
and
i
immediately
proceeded
to
my
house
where
i
found
harcourt
who
had
been
in
great
anxiety
about
me
the
next
morning
i
went
to
my
old
legal
friend
to
whom
i
communicated
all
that
had
happened
well
done
newland
replied
he
after
i
had
finished
i
bet
ten
to
one
that
you
find
out
your
father
your
life
already
would
not
make
a
bad
novel
if
you
continue
your
hairbreadth
adventures
in
this
way
it
will
be
quite
interesting
although
satisfied
in
my
own
mind
that
i
had
discovered
parentage
and
anxious
to
impart
the
joyful
intelligence
i
resolved
not
to
see
her
until
everything
should
be
satisfactorily
arranged
the
residence
of
the
dowager
lady
de
clare
was
soon
discovered
by
mr
masterton
it
was
at
richmond
and
thither
he
and
i
proceeded
we
were
ushered
into
the
and
to
my
delight
upon
her
entrance
i
perceived
that
it
was
the
same
beautiful
person
in
whose
ears
i
had
seen
the
coral
and
gold
matching
the
necklace
belonging
to
fleta
i
considered
it
better
to
allow
mr
masterton
to
break
the
subject
you
are
madam
the
widow
of
the
late
sir
william
de
clare
the
lady
bowed
you
will
excuse
me
madam
but
i
have
most
important
reasons
for
asking
you
a
few
questions
which
otherwise
may
appear
to
be
intrusive
are
you
aware
of
the
death
of
his
brother
sir
henry
de
clare
indeed
i
was
not
replied
she
i
seldom
look
at
a
paper
and
i
have
long
ceased
to
correspond
with
anyone
in
ireland
may
i
ask
you
what
occasioned
his
death
he
fell
by
his
own
hands
madam
lady
de
clare
covered
up
her
face
god
forgive
him
said
she
in
a
low
voice
lady
de
clare
upon
what
terms
were
your
husband
and
the
late
sir
henry
it
is
important
to
know
not
on
the
very
best
sir
indeed
latterly
for
years
they
never
met
or
spoke
we
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
him
were
there
any
grounds
for
many
sir
on
the
part
of
the
elder
brother
but
none
on
that
of
sir
henry
who
was
treated
with
every
kindness
until
he
lady
de
clare
stopped
until
he
behaved
very
ill
to
him
as
we
afterwards
discovered
henry
de
clare
had
squandered
away
the
small
portion
left
him
by
his
father
and
had
ever
after
that
been
liberally
supplied
by
his
eldest
brother
until
he
had
attempted
to
seduce
lady
de
clare
upon
which
he
was
dismissed
for
ever
and
now
madam
i
must
revert
to
a
painful
subject
you
had
a
daughter
by
your
marriage
yes
replied
the
lady
with
a
deep
sigh
how
did
you
lose
her
pray
do
not
think
i
am
creating
this
distress
on
your
part
without
strong
reasons
she
was
playing
in
the
garden
and
the
nurse
who
thought
it
rather
cold
ran
in
for
a
minute
to
get
a
handkerchief
to
tie
round
her
neck
when
the
nurse
returned
the
child
had
disappeared
lady
de
clare
put
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
eyes
where
did
you
find
her
afterwards
it
was
not
until
three
weeks
afterwards
that
her
body
was
found
in
a
pond
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
did
the
nurse
not
seek
her
when
she
discovered
that
she
was
not
in
the
garden
she
did
and
immediately
ran
in
that
direction
it
is
quite
strange
that
the
child
could
have
got
so
far
without
the
nurse
perceiving
her
how
long
is
it
ago
it
is
now
nine
years
and
the
age
of
the
child
at
the
time
about
six
years
old
i
think
newland
you
may
now
speak
to
lady
de
clare
lady
de
clare
have
you
not
a
pair
of
of
coral
and
gold
of
very
remarkable
workmanship
i
have
sir
replied
she
with
surprise
had
you
not
a
necklace
of
the
same
and
if
so
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
examine
this
i
presented
the
necklace
merciful
heaven
cried
lady
de
clare
it
is
the
very
necklace
it
was
on
my
poor
cecilia
when
she
was
drowned
and
it
was
not
found
with
the
body
how
came
it
into
your
possession
sir
at
one
time
continued
lady
de
clare
weeping
i
thought
that
it
was
possible
that
the
temptation
of
the
necklace
which
has
a
great
deal
of
gold
in
it
must
as
it
was
not
found
on
her
corpse
have
been
an
inducement
for
the
gipsies
who
were
in
the
neighbourhood
to
drown
her
but
sir
william
would
not
believe
it
rather
supposing
that
in
her
struggles
in
the
water
she
must
have
broken
it
and
that
it
had
thus
been
detached
from
her
neck
is
it
to
return
this
unfortunate
necklace
that
you
have
come
here
no
madam
not
altogether
had
you
two
white
ponies
at
the
time
yes
sir
was
there
a
in
the
garden
yes
sir
replied
the
astonished
lady
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
describe
the
appearance
of
your
child
as
she
was
at
the
time
that
you
lost
her
she
was
but
all
mothers
are
partial
and
perhaps
i
may
also
be
so
a
very
fair
lovely
little
girl
with
light
hair
i
presume
yes
sir
but
why
these
questions
surely
you
can
not
ask
them
for
nothing
continued
she
hurriedly
tell
me
sir
why
all
these
questions
mr
masterton
replied
because
madam
we
have
some
hopes
that
you
have
been
deceived
and
that
it
is
possible
that
your
daughter
was
not
drowned
lady
de
clare
breathless
and
her
mouth
open
fixed
her
eyes
upon
mr
masterton
and
exclaimed
not
drowned
o
my
god
my
head
and
then
she
fell
back
insensible
i
have
been
too
precipitate
said
mr
masterton
going
to
her
assistance
but
joy
does
not

in
which
if
the
reader
does
not
sympathise
with
the
parties
he
had
better
shut
the
book
in
a
few
minutes
lady
de
clare
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
hear
the
outline
of
our
history
and
as
soon
as
it
was
over
she
insisted
upon
immediately
going
with
us
to
the
school
where
fleta
was
domiciled
as
she
could
ascertain
by
several
marks
known
but
to
a
nurse
or
mother
if
more
evidence
was
required
whether
fleta
was
her
child
or
not
to
allow
her
to
remain
in
such
a
state
of
anxiety
was
impossible
mr
masterton
agreed
and
we
posted
to
where
we
arrived
in
the
evening
now
gentlemen
leave
me
but
one
minute
with
the
child
and
when
i
ring
the
bell
you
may
enter
lady
de
clare
was
in
so
nervous
and
agitated
a
state
that
she
could
not
walk
into
the
parlour
without
assistance
we
led
her
to
a
chair
and
in
a
minute
fleta
was
called
down
perceiving
me
in
the
passage
she
ran
to
me
stop
my
dear
fleta
there
is
a
lady
in
the
parlour
who
wishes
to
see
you
a
lady
japhet
yes
my
dear
go
in
fleta
obeyed
and
in
a
minute
we
heard
a
scream
and
fleta
hastily
opened
the
door
quick
quick
the
lady
has
fallen
down
we
ran
in
and
found
lady
de
clare
on
the
floor
and
it
was
some
time
before
she
returned
to
her
senses
as
soon
as
she
did
she
fell
down
on
her
knees
holding
up
her
hands
as
in
prayer
and
then
stretched
her
arms
out
to
fleta
my
child
my
child
it
is
it
is
indeed
a
flood
of
tears
poured
forth
on
fleta
neck
relieved
her
and
we
then
left
them
together
old
masterton
observing
as
we
took
our
seats
in
the
back
parlour
by
gad
japhet
you
deserve
to
find
your
own
father
in
about
an
hour
lady
de
clare
requested
to
see
us
fleta
rushed
into
my
arms
and
sobbed
while
her
mother
apologised
to
mr
masterton
for
the
delay
and
excusable
neglect
towards
him
mr
newland
madam
is
the
person
to
whom
you
are
indebted
for
your
present
happiness
i
will
now
if
you
please
take
my
leave
and
will
call
upon
you
i
will
not
detain
you
mr
masterton
but
mr
newland
will
i
trust
come
home
with
cecilia
and
me
i
have
much
to
ask
of
him
i
consented
and
mr
masterton
went
back
to
town
i
went
to
the
principal
hotel
to
order
a
chaise
and
horses
while
fleta
packed
up
her
wardrobe
in
half
an
hour
we
set
off
and
it
was
midnight
before
we
arrived
at
richmond
during
my
journey
i
narrated
to
lady
de
clare
every
particular
of
our
meeting
with
fleta
we
were
all
glad
to
go
to
bed
and
the
kind
manner
in
which
lady
de
clare
wished
me
good
night
with
god
bless
you
mr
newland
brought
the
tears
into
my
eyes
i
breakfasted
alone
the
next
morning
lady
de
clare
and
her
daughter
remaining
up
stairs
it
was
nearly
twelve
when
they
made
their
appearance
both
so
apparently
happy
that
i
could
not
help
thinking
when
shall
i
have
such
pleasure
when
shall
i
find
out
who
is
my
father
my
brow
was
clouded
as
the
thought
entered
my
mind
when
lady
de
clare
requested
that
i
would
inform
her
who
it
was
to
whom
she
and
her
daughter
were
under
such
eternal
obligations
i
had
then
to
relate
my
own
eventful
history
most
of
which
was
as
new
to
cecilia
as
she
now
must
be
called
as
it
was
to
her
mother
i
had
just
terminated
the
escape
from
the
castle
when
mr
masterton
carriage
drove
up
to
the
door
as
soon
as
he
had
bowed
to
lady
de
clare
he
said
to
me
japhet
here
is
a
letter
directed
to
you
to
my
care
from
ireland
which
i
have
brought
for
you
it
is
from
kathleen
mcshane
sir
replied
i
and
requesting
leave
i
broke
the
seal
it
contained
another
i
read
kathleen
and
then
hastily
opened
the
other
it
was
from
nattee
or
lady
de
clare
and
ran
as
follows
japhet
newland
fleta
is
the
daughter
of
sir
william
de
clare
dearly
has
my
husband
paid
for
his
act
of
folly
and
wickedness
and
to
which
you
must
know
i
never
was
a
party
yours
nattee
the
letter
from
kathleen
added
more
strange
information
lady
de
clare
after
the
funeral
of
her
husband
had
sent
for
the
steward
made
every
necessary
arrangement
discharged
the
servants
and
then
had
herself
disappeared
no
one
knew
whither
but
it
was
reported
that
somebody
very
much
resembling
her
had
been
seen
travelling
south
in
company
with
a
gang
of
gipsies
i
handed
both
letters
over
to
lady
de
clare
and
mr
masterton
poor
lady
de
clare
observed
the
mother
nattee
will
never
leave
her
tribe
observed
cecilia
quietly
you
are
right
my
dear
replied
i
she
will
be
happier
with
her
tribe
where
she
commands
as
a
queen
than
ever
she
was
at
the
castle
mr
masterton
then
entered
into
a
detail
with
lady
de
clare
as
to
what
steps
ought
immediately
to
be
taken
as
the
would
otherwise
give
some
trouble
and
having
obtained
her
acquiescence
it
was
time
to
withdraw
mr
newland
i
trust
you
will
consider
us
as
your
warmest
friends
i
am
so
much
in
your
debt
that
i
never
can
repay
you
but
i
am
also
in
your
debt
in
a
pecuniary
way
that
at
least
you
must
permit
me
to
refund
when
i
require
it
lady
de
clare
i
will
accept
it
do
not
pray
vex
me
by
the
proposition
i
have
not
much
happiness
as
it
is
although
i
am
rejoiced
at
yours
and
that
of
your
daughter
come
lady
de
clare
i
must
not
allow
you
to
tease
my
protege
you
do
not
know
how
sensitive
he
is
we
will
now
take
our
leave
you
will
come
soon
said
cecilia
looking
anxiously
at
me
you
have
your
mother
cecilia
replied
i
what
can
you
wish
for
more
i
am
a
nobody
without
a
parent
cecilia
burst
into
tears
i
embraced
her
and
mr
masterton
and
i
left
the
room
part
two
chapter
twenty
seven
i
return
to
the
gay
world
but
am
not
well
received
i
am
quite
disgusted
with
it
and
honesty
and
everything
else
how
strange
now
that
i
had
succeeded
in
the
next
dearest
object
of
my
wishes
after
ascertaining
my
own
parentage
that
i
should
have
felt
so
miserable
but
it
was
the
fact
and
i
can
not
deny
it
i
could
hardly
answer
mr
masterton
during
our
journey
to
town
and
when
i
threw
myself
on
the
sofa
in
my
own
room
i
felt
as
if
i
was
desolate
and
deserted
i
did
not
repine
at
cecilia
happiness
so
far
from
it
i
would
have
sacrificed
my
life
for
her
but
she
was
a
creature
of
my
own
one
of
the
objects
in
this
world
to
which
i
was
endeared
one
that
had
been
dependent
on
me
and
loved
me
now
that
she
was
restored
to
her
parent
she
rose
above
me
and
i
was
left
still
more
desolate
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
passed
a
week
of
such
misery
as
the
one
which
followed
a
productive
of
so
much
happiness
to
others
and
which
had
been
sought
with
so
much
eagerness
and
at
so
much
risk
by
myself
it
was
no
feeling
of
envy
god
knows
but
it
appeared
to
me
as
if
everyone
in
the
world
was
to
be
made
happy
except
myself
but
i
had
more
to
bear
up
against
when
i
had
quitted
for
ireland
it
was
still
supposed
that
i
was
a
young
man
of
large
fortune
the
truth
had
not
been
told
i
had
acceded
to
mr
masterton
suggestions
that
i
was
no
longer
to
appear
under
false
colours
and
had
requested
harcourt
to
whom
i
made
known
my
real
condition
that
he
would
everywhere
state
the
truth
news
like
this
flies
like
wildfire
there
were
too
many
whom
perhaps
when
under
the
patronage
of
major
carbonnell
and
the
universal
rapture
from
my
supposed
wealth
i
had
treated
with
hauteur
glad
to
receive
the
intelligence
and
spread
it
far
and
wide
my
as
they
pleased
to
term
it
was
the
theme
of
every
party
and
many
were
the
indignant
remarks
of
the
dowagers
who
had
so
often
indirectly
proposed
to
me
their
daughters
and
if
there
was
anyone
more
virulent
than
the
rest
i
hardly
need
say
that
it
was
lady
maelstrom
who
nearly
killed
her
job
horses
in
driving
about
from
one
acquaintance
to
another
to
represent
my
atrocity
in
presuming
to
deceive
my
betters
harcourt
who
had
agreed
to
live
with
me
harcourt
who
had
praised
my
magnanimity
in
making
the
disclosure
even
harcourt
fell
off
and
about
a
fortnight
after
i
had
arrived
in
town
told
me
that
not
finding
the
lodgings
so
convenient
as
his
former
abode
he
intended
to
return
to
it
he
took
a
friendly
leave
but
i
perceived
that
if
we
happened
to
meet
in
the
streets
he
often
contrived
to
be
looking
another
way
and
at
last
a
slight
recognition
was
all
that
i
received
satisfied
that
it
was
intended
i
no
longer
noticed
him
he
followed
but
the
example
of
others
so
great
was
the
outcry
raised
by
those
who
had
hoped
to
have
secured
me
as
a
good
match
that
any
young
man
of
fashion
who
was
seen
with
me
had
by
many
his
name
erased
from
their
visiting
lists
this
decided
my
fate
and
i
was
alone
for
some
time
i
bore
up
proudly
i
returned
a
glance
of
defiance
but
this
could
not
last
the
treatment
of
others
received
a
slight
check
from
the
kindness
of
lord
windermear
who
repeatedly
asked
me
to
his
table
but
i
perceived
that
even
there
although
suffered
as
a
protege
of
his
lordship
anything
more
than
common
civility
was
studiously
avoided
in
order
that
no
intimacy
might
result
mr
masterton
upon
whom
i
occasionally
called
saw
that
i
was
unwell
and
unhappy
he
encouraged
me
but
alas
a
man
must
be
more
than
mortal
who
with
fine
feelings
can
endure
the
scorn
of
the
world
timothy
poor
fellow
who
witnessed
more
of
my
unhappy
state
of
mind
than
anybody
else
offered
in
vain
his
consolation
and
this
thought
i
is
the
reward
of
virtue
and
honesty
truly
virtue
is
its
own
reward
for
it
obtains
no
other
as
long
as
i
was
under
false
colours
allowing
the
world
to
deceive
themselves
i
was
courted
and
flattered
now
that
i
have
thrown
off
the
mask
and
put
on
the
raiment
of
truth
i
am
a
despised
miserable
being
yes
but
is
not
this
my
own
fault
did
i
not
by
my
own
deception
bring
all
this
upon
myself
whether
unmasked
by
others
or
by
myself
is
it
not
equally
true
that
i
have
been
playing
false
and
am
now
punished
for
it
what
do
the
world
care
for
your
having
returned
to
truth
you
have
offended
by
deceiving
them
and
that
is
an
offence
which
your
repentance
will
not
extenuate
it
was
but
too
true
i
had
brought
it
all
on
myself
and
this
reflection
increased
my
misery
for
my
dishonesty
i
had
been
justly
and
severely
punished
whether
i
was
ever
to
be
rewarded
for
my
subsequent
honesty
still
remained
to
be
proved
but
i
knew
very
well
that
most
people
would
have
written
off
such
a
reward
as
a
bad
debt
once
i
consulted
with
mr
masterton
as
to
the
chance
of
there
being
any
information
relative
to
my
birth
in
the
packet
left
in
the
charge
of
mr
cophagus
i
have
been
thinking
over
it
my
dear
newland
said
he
and
i
wish
i
could
give
you
any
hopes
but
i
can
not
having
succeeded
with
regard
to
your
little
protege
you
are
now
so
sanguine
with
respect
to
yourself
that
a
trifle
light
as
air
is
magnified
as
the
poet
says
confirmation
strong
as
holy
writ
now
consider
somebody
calls
at
the
foundling
to
ask
after
you
which
i
acknowledge
to
be
a
satisfactory
point
his
name
is
taken
down
by
an
illiterate
brute
as
derbennon
but
how
you
can
decide
upon
the
real
name
and
assume
it
is
de
benyon
is
really
more
than
i
can
imagine
allowing
every
scope
to
fancy
it
is
in
the
first
instance
therefore
you
are
at
fault
as
there
are
many
other
names
which
may
have
been
given
by
the
party
who
called
nay
more
is
it
at
all
certain
that
the
party
in
a
case
like
this
would
give
his
real
name
let
us
follow
it
up
allowing
the
name
to
have
been
de
benyon
you
discover
that
one
brother
is
not
married
and
that
there
are
some
papers
belonging
to
him
in
the
possession
of
an
old
woman
who
dies
and
upon
these
slight
grounds
what
would
you
attempt
to
establish
that
because
that
person
was
known
not
to
have
married
therefore
was
for
you
are
stated
to
have
been
born
in
wedlock
and
because
there
is
a
packet
of
papers
belonging
to
him
in
the
possession
of
another
party
that
this
packet
of
papers
to
you
do
you
not
perceive
how
you
are
led
away
by
your
excited
feelings
on
the
subject
i
could
not
deny
that
mr
masterton
arguments
had
demolished
the
whole
fabric
which
i
had
built
up
you
are
right
sir
replied
i
mournfully
i
wish
i
were
dead
never
speak
in
that
way
mr
newland
before
me
replied
the
old
lawyer
in
an
angry
tone
without
you
wish
to
forfeit
my
good
opinion
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
i
am
most
miserable
i
am
avoided
by
all
who
know
me
thrown
out
of
all
society
i
have
not
a
parent
or
a
relative
isolated
being
as
i
am
what
have
i
to
live
for
my
dear
fellow
you
are
not
years
of
age
replied
mr
masterton
and
you
have
made
two
sincere
friends
both
powerful
in
their
own
way
i
mean
lord
windermear
and
myself
and
you
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
others
happy
believe
me
that
is
much
to
have
accomplished
at
so
early
an
age
you
have
much
to
live
for
live
to
gain
more
friends
live
to
gain
reputation
live
to
do
good
to
be
grateful
for
the
benefits
you
have
received
and
to
be
humble
when
chastened
by
providence
you
have
yet
to
learn
where
and
only
where
true
happiness
is
to
be
found
since
you
are
so
much
out
of
spirits
go
down
to
lady
de
clare
see
her
happiness
and
that
of
her
little
girl
and
then
when
you
reflect
that
it
was
your
own
work
you
will
hardly
say
that
you
have
lived
in
vain
i
was
too
much
overpowered
to
speak
after
a
pause
mr
masterton
continued
when
did
you
see
them
last
i
have
never
seen
them
sir
since
i
was
with
you
at
their
meeting
what
have
you
not
called
now
nearly
two
months
japhet
you
are
wrong
they
will
be
hurt
at
your
neglect
and
want
of
kindness
have
you
written
or
heard
from
them
i
have
received
one
or
two
pressing
invitations
sir
but
i
have
not
been
in
a
state
of
mind
to
avail
myself
of
their
politeness
politeness
you
are
wrong
all
wrong
japhet
your
mind
is
cankered
or
you
never
would
have
used
that
term
i
thought
you
were
composed
of
better
materials
but
it
appears
that
although
you
can
sail
with
a
fair
wind
you
can
not
buffet
against
an
adverse
gale
because
you
are
no
longer
fooled
and
flattered
by
the
interested
and
the
designing
like
many
others
you
have
quarrelled
with
the
world
is
it
not
so
perhaps
you
are
right
sir
i
know
that
i
am
right
and
that
you
are
wrong
now
i
shall
be
seriously
displeased
if
you
do
not
go
down
and
see
lady
de
clare
and
her
daughter
as
soon
as
you
can
i
will
obey
your
orders
sir
my
wishes
japhet
not
my
orders
let
me
see
you
when
you
return
you
must
no
longer
be
idle
consider
that
you
are
about
to
recommence
your
career
in
life
that
hitherto
you
have
pursued
the
wrong
path
from
which
you
have
nobly
returned
you
must
prepare
for
exertions
and
learn
to
trust
to
god
and
a
good
conscience
lord
windermear
and
i
had
a
long
conversation
relative
to
you
yesterday
evening
and
when
you
come
back
i
will
detail
to
you
what
are
our
views
respecting
your
future
advantage
part
two
chapter
twenty
eight
a
new
character
appears
but
not
a
very
amiable
one
but
i
attach
myself
to
him
as
drowning
men
catch
at
straws
i
took
my
leave
more
composed
in
mind
and
the
next
day
i
went
down
to
lady
de
clare
i
was
kindly
received
more
than
kindly
i
was
affectionately
and
parentally
received
by
the
mother
and
by
cecilia
as
a
dear
brother
but
they
perceived
my
melancholy
and
when
they
had
upbraided
me
for
my
long
neglect
they
inquired
the
cause
as
i
had
already
made
lady
de
clare
acquainted
with
my
previous
history
i
had
no
secrets
in
fact
it
was
a
consolation
to
confide
my
griefs
to
them
lord
windermear
was
too
much
above
me
mr
masterton
was
too
timothy
was
too
inferior
and
they
were
all
men
but
the
kind
soothing
of
a
woman
was
peculiarly
grateful
and
after
a
sojourn
of
three
days
i
took
my
leave
with
my
mind
much
less
depressed
than
when
i
arrived
on
my
return
i
called
upon
mr
masterton
who
stated
to
me
that
lord
windermear
was
anxious
to
serve
me
and
that
he
would
exert
his
interest
in
any
way
which
might
be
most
congenial
to
my
feelings
that
he
would
procure
me
a
commission
in
the
army
or
a
writership
to
india
or
if
i
preferred
it
i
might
study
the
law
under
the
auspices
of
mr
masterton
if
none
of
these
propositions
suited
me
i
might
state
what
would
be
preferred
and
that
as
far
as
his
interest
and
pecuniary
assistance
could
avail
i
might
depend
on
it
so
now
japhet
you
may
go
home
and
reflect
seriously
upon
these
offers
and
when
you
have
made
up
your
mind
what
course
you
will
steer
you
have
only
to
let
me
know
i
returned
my
thanks
to
mr
masterton
and
begged
that
he
would
convey
my
grateful
acknowledgments
to
his
lordship
as
i
walked
home
i
met
a
captain
atkinson
a
man
of
very
doubtful
character
whom
by
the
advice
of
carbonnell
i
had
always
kept
at
a
distance
he
had
lost
a
large
fortune
by
gambling
and
having
been
pigeoned
had
as
is
usual
ended
by
becoming
a
he
was
a
fashionable
man
of
good
family
suffered
in
society
for
he
had
found
out
that
it
was
necessary
to
hold
his
position
by
main
force
he
was
a
noted
duellist
had
killed
his
three
or
four
men
and
a
cut
direct
from
any
person
was
with
him
sufficient
grounds
for
sending
a
friend
everybody
was
civil
to
him
because
no
one
wished
to
quarrel
with
him
my
dear
mr
newland
said
he
offering
his
hand
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
i
have
heard
at
the
clubs
of
your
misfortune
and
there
were
some
free
remarks
made
by
some
i
have
great
pleasure
in
saying
that
i
put
an
immediate
stop
to
them
by
telling
them
that
if
they
were
repeated
in
my
presence
i
should
consider
it
as
a
personal
quarrel
three
months
before
had
i
met
captain
atkinson
i
should
have
returned
his
bow
with
studied
politeness
and
have
left
him
but
how
changed
were
my
feelings
i
took
his
hand
and
shook
it
warmly
my
dear
sir
replied
i
i
am
very
much
obliged
for
your
kind
and
considerate
conduct
there
are
more
who
are
inclined
to
calumniate
than
to
defend
and
always
will
be
in
this
world
mr
newland
but
i
have
a
fellow
feeling
i
recollect
how
i
was
received
and
flattered
when
i
was
introduced
as
a
young
man
of
fortune
and
how
i
was
deserted
and
neglected
when
i
was
cleaned
out
i
know
now
they
are
so
civil
to
me
and
i
value
their
civility
at
just
as
much
as
it
is
worth
will
you
accept
my
arm
i
am
going
your
way
i
could
not
refuse
but
i
coloured
when
i
took
it
for
i
felt
that
i
was
not
adding
to
my
reputation
by
being
seen
in
his
company
and
still
i
felt
that
although
not
adding
to
my
reputation
i
was
less
likely
to
receive
insult
and
that
the
same
cause
which
induced
them
to
be
civil
to
him
would
perhaps
operate
when
they
found
me
allied
with
him
be
it
so
thought
i
i
will
if
possible
politeness
we
were
strolling
down
bond
street
when
we
met
a
young
man
well
known
in
the
fashionable
circles
who
had
dropped
my
acquaintance
after
having
been
formerly
most
pressing
to
obtain
it
atkinson
faced
him
good
morning
mr
oxberry
good
morning
captain
atkinson
replied
mr
oxberry
i
thought
you
knew
my
friend
mr
newland
observed
atkinson
rather
fiercely
oh
really
i
quite
i
beg
pardon
good
morning
mr
newland
you
have
been
long
absent
i
did
not
see
you
at
lady
maelstrom
last
night
no
replied
i
carelessly
nor
will
you
ever
when
you
next
see
her
ladyship
ask
her
with
my
compliments
whether
she
has
had
another
fainting
fit
i
shall
certainly
have
great
pleasure
in
carrying
your
message
mr
newland
good
morning
that
fool
observed
atkinson
will
now
run
all
over
town
and
you
will
see
the
consequence
we
met
one
or
two
others
and
to
them
atkinson
put
the
same
question
i
thought
you
knew
my
friend
mr
newland
at
last
just
as
we
arrived
at
my
own
house
in
saint
james
street
who
should
we
meet
but
harcourt
harcourt
immediately
perceived
me
and
bowed
low
as
he
passed
on
so
that
his
bow
would
have
served
for
both
but
atkinson
stopped
i
must
beg
your
pardon
harcourt
for
detaining
you
a
moment
but
what
are
the
odds
upon
the
vestris
colt
for
the
derby
upon
my
word
captain
atkinson
i
was
told
but
i
have
forgotten
your
memory
appears
bad
for
you
have
also
forgotten
your
old
friend
mr
newland
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
newland
there
is
no
occasion
to
beg
my
pardon
mr
harcourt
interrupted
i
for
i
tell
you
plainly
that
i
despise
you
too
much
to
ever
wish
to
be
acquainted
with
you
you
will
oblige
me
sir
by
never
presuming
to
touch
your
hat
or
otherwise
notice
me
harcourt
coloured
and
started
back
such
language
mr
newland
is
what
you
deserve
ask
your
own
conscience
leave
us
sir
and
i
walked
on
with
captain
atkinson
you
have
done
well
newland
observed
atkinson
he
can
not
submit
to
that
language
for
he
knows
that
i
have
heard
it
a
meeting
you
will
of
course
have
no
objection
to
it
will
be
of
immense
advantage
to
you
none
whatever
replied
i
for
if
there
is
any
one
man
who
deserves
to
be
punished
for
his
conduct
towards
me
it
is
harcourt
will
you
come
up
captain
atkinson
and
if
not
better
engaged
take
a
quiet
dinner
and
a
bottle
of
wine
with
me
our
conversation
during
dinner
was
desultory
but
after
the
first
bottle
atkinson
became
communicative
and
his
history
not
only
made
me
feel
better
inclined
towards
him
but
afforded
me
another
instance
as
well
as
carbonnell
how
often
it
is
that
those
who
would
have
done
well
are
first
plundered
and
then
driven
to
desperation
by
the
heartlessness
of
the
world
the
cases
however
had
this
difference
that
carbonnell
had
always
contrived
to
keep
his
reputation
above
water
while
that
of
atkinson
was
gone
and
never
to
be
we
had
just
finished
our
wine
when
a
note
was
brought
from
harcourt
informing
me
that
he
should
send
a
friend
the
next
morning
for
an
explanation
of
my
conduct
i
handed
it
over
to
atkinson
my
dear
sir
i
am
at
your
service
replied
he
without
you
have
anybody
among
your
acquaintances
whom
you
may
prefer
thank
you
replied
i
captain
atkinson
it
can
not
be
in
better
hands
that
is
settled
then
and
now
where
shall
we
go
wherever
you
please
then
i
shall
try
if
i
can
win
a
little
money
if
you
come
you
need
not
play
you
can
look
on
it
will
serve
to
divert
your
thoughts
at
all
events
i
felt
so
anxious
to
avoid
reflection
that
i
immediately
accepted
his
offer
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
in
the
room
and
in
front
of
the
et
table
covered
with
gold
and
bank
notes
atkinson
did
not
commence
his
play
immediately
but
pricked
the
chances
on
a
card
as
they
ran
after
half
an
hour
he
laid
down
his
stakes
and
was
fortunate
i
could
no
longer
withstand
the
temptation
and
i
backed
him
in
less
than
an
hour
we
both
had
won
considerably
that
is
enough
said
he
to
me
sweeping
up
his
money
we
must
not
try
the
slippery
dame
too
long
i
followed
his
example
and
shortly
afterwards
we
quitted
the
house
i
will
walk
home
with
you
newland
never
if
you
can
help
it
especially
if
you
have
been
a
winner
leave
a
gaming
house
alone
going
home
i
asked
atkinson
if
he
would
come
up
he
did
so
and
then
we
examined
our
winnings
i
know
mine
replied
he
within
twenty
pounds
for
i
always
leave
off
at
a
certain
point
i
have
three
hundred
pounds
and
something
more
he
had
won
three
hundred
and
pounds
i
had
won
ninety
pounds
as
we
sat
over
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
i
inquired
whether
he
was
always
fortunate
no
of
course
i
am
not
replied
atkinson
but
on
the
whole
in
the
course
of
the
year
i
am
a
winner
of
sufficient
to
support
myself
is
there
any
rule
by
which
people
are
guided
who
play
i
observed
many
of
those
who
were
seated
pricking
the
chances
with
great
care
and
then
staking
their
money
at
intervals
et
i
believe
to
be
the
fairest
of
all
games
replied
atkinson
but
where
there
is
a
percentage
invariably
in
favour
of
the
bank
although
one
may
win
and
another
lose
still
the
profits
must
be
in
favour
of
the
bank
if
a
man
were
to
play
all
the
year
round
he
would
lose
the
national
debt
in
the
end
as
for
martingales
and
all
those
calculations
which
you
observed
them
so
busy
with
they
are
all
useless
i
have
tried
everything
and
there
is
only
one
chance
of
success
but
then
you
must
not
be
a
gambler
not
a
gambler
no
you
must
not
be
carried
away
by
the
excitement
of
the
game
or
you
will
infallibly
lose
you
must
have
a
strength
of
mind
which
few
have
or
you
will
be
soon
cleaned
out
but
you
say
that
you
win
on
the
whole
have
you
no
rule
to
guide
you
yes
i
have
strange
as
the
chances
are
i
have
been
so
accustomed
to
them
that
i
generally
put
down
my
stake
right
when
i
am
once
in
a
run
of
luck
i
have
a
method
of
my
own
but
what
it
is
i
can
not
tell
only
this
i
know
that
if
i
depart
from
it
i
always
lose
my
money
but
that
is
what
you
may
call
good
luck
or
what
you
please
it
is
not
a
rule
where
then
are
your
rules
simply
these
two
the
first
it
is
not
difficult
to
adhere
to
i
make
a
rule
never
to
lose
but
a
certain
sum
if
i
am
unlucky
when
i
commence
say
twenty
stakes
whatever
may
be
the
amount
of
the
stake
that
you
play
this
rule
is
easily
adhered
to
by
not
taking
more
money
with
you
and
i
am
not
one
of
those
to
whom
the
croupier
or
porters
will
lend
money
the
second
rule
is
the
most
difficult
and
decides
whether
you
are
a
gambler
or
not
i
make
a
rule
always
to
leave
off
when
i
have
won
a
certain
sum
or
even
before
if
the
chances
of
my
game
fluctuate
there
is
the
difficulty
it
appears
very
foolish
not
to
follow
up
luck
but
the
fact
is
fortune
is
so
capricious
that
if
you
trust
her
more
than
an
hour
she
will
desert
you
this
is
my
mode
of
play
and
with
me
it
answers
but
it
does
not
follow
that
it
would
answer
with
another
but
it
is
very
late
or
rather
very
early
i
wish
you
a
good
night
part
two
chapter
twenty
nine
become
principal
instead
of
second
in
a
duel
and
risk
my
own
and
another
life
my
own
and
others
happiness
and
peace
of
mind
because
i
have
been
punished
as
i
deserved
after
captain
atkinson
had
left
me
i
stated
to
timothy
what
had
passed
and
do
you
think
you
will
have
to
fight
a
duel
sir
cried
timothy
with
alarm
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
replied
i
you
never
will
find
your
father
sir
if
you
go
on
this
way
said
timothy
as
if
to
divert
my
attention
from
such
a
purpose
not
in
this
world
perhaps
tim
perhaps
i
may
be
sent
the
right
road
by
a
bullet
and
find
him
in
the
next
do
you
think
your
father
if
dead
has
gone
to
heaven
i
hope
so
timothy
then
what
chance
have
you
of
meeting
him
if
you
go
out
of
the
world
attempting
the
life
of
your
old
friend
that
is
what
you
call
a
poser
my
dear
timothy
but
i
can
not
help
myself
this
i
can
safely
say
that
i
have
no
animosity
against
mr
harcourt
at
least
not
sufficient
to
have
any
wish
to
take
away
his
life
well
that
something
to
be
sure
but
do
you
know
japhet
i
not
quite
sure
you
hit
the
right
road
when
you
set
up
for
a
gentleman
no
timothy
no
man
can
be
in
the
right
road
who
deceives
i
have
been
all
wrong
and
i
am
afraid
i
am
going
from
worse
to
worse
but
i
can
not
moralise
i
must
go
to
sleep
and
forget
everything
if
i
can
the
next
morning
about
eleven
a
mr
cotgrave
called
upon
me
on
the
part
of
harcourt
i
referred
him
to
captain
atkinson
and
he
bowed
and
quitted
the
room
captain
atkinson
soon
called
he
had
remained
at
home
expecting
the
message
and
had
made
every
arrangement
with
the
second
he
stayed
with
me
the
whole
day
the
major
pistols
were
examined
and
approved
of
we
dined
drank
freely
and
he
afterwards
proposed
that
i
should
accompany
him
to
one
of
the
hells
as
they
are
called
this
i
refused
as
i
had
some
arrangements
to
make
and
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
sent
for
timothy
tim
said
i
if
i
should
be
unlucky
you
are
my
executor
and
residuary
legatee
my
will
was
made
when
in
dublin
and
is
in
the
charge
of
mr
cophagus
japhet
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
one
favour
which
is
to
go
to
the
ground
with
you
i
had
rather
be
there
than
remain
here
in
suspense
of
course
my
dear
fellow
if
you
wish
it
replied
i
but
i
must
go
to
bed
as
i
am
to
be
called
at
four
so
let
have
no
sentimentalising
or
sermonising
good
night
god
bless
you
i
was
at
that
time
in
a
state
of
mind
which
made
me
reckless
of
life
or
of
consequences
stung
by
the
treatment
which
i
received
mad
with
the
world
contumely
i
was
desperate
true
it
was
as
mr
masterton
said
i
had
not
courage
to
buffet
against
an
adverse
gale
timothy
did
not
go
to
bed
and
at
four
was
at
my
side
i
rose
dressed
myself
with
the
greatest
care
and
was
soon
joined
by
captain
atkinson
we
then
set
off
in
a
to
the
same
spot
to
which
i
had
but
a
few
months
before
driven
with
poor
carbonnell
his
memory
and
his
death
came
like
a
cloud
over
my
mind
but
it
was
but
for
a
moment
i
cared
little
for
life
harcourt
and
his
second
were
on
the
ground
a
few
minutes
before
us
each
party
saluted
politely
and
the
seconds
proceeded
to
business
we
fired
and
harcourt
fell
with
a
bullet
above
his
knee
i
went
up
to
him
and
he
extended
his
hand
newland
said
he
i
have
deserved
this
i
was
a
coward
in
the
first
place
to
desert
you
as
i
did
and
a
coward
in
the
second
to
fire
at
a
man
whom
i
had
injured
gentlemen
continued
he
appealing
to
the
seconds
recollect
i
before
you
acquit
mr
newland
of
all
blame
and
desire
if
any
further
accident
should
happen
to
me
that
my
relations
will
take
no
steps
whatever
against
him
harcourt
was
very
pale
and
bleeding
fast
without
any
answer
i
examined
the
wound
and
found
by
the
colour
of
the
blood
and
its
gushing
that
an
artery
had
been
divided
my
professional
knowledge
saved
his
life
i
compressed
the
artery
while
i
gave
directions
to
the
others
a
handkerchief
was
tied
tight
round
his
thigh
above
the
wound
a
round
stone
selected
and
placed
under
the
handkerchief
in
the
femoral
groove
and
the
ramrod
of
one
of
the
pistols
then
made
use
of
as
a
winch
until
the
whole
acted
as
a
tourniquet
i
removed
my
thumbs
found
that
the
haemorrhage
was
stopped
and
then
directed
that
he
should
be
taken
home
on
a
door
and
surgical
assistance
immediately
sent
for
you
appear
to
understand
these
things
sir
said
mr
cotgrave
tell
me
is
there
any
danger
he
must
suffer
amputation
replied
i
in
a
low
voice
so
that
harcourt
could
not
hear
me
pray
watch
the
tourniquet
carefully
as
he
is
taken
home
for
should
it
slip
it
will
be
fatal
i
then
bowed
to
mr
cotgrave
and
followed
by
captain
atkinson
stepped
into
the
and
drove
home
i
will
leave
you
now
newland
said
captain
atkinson
it
is
necessary
that
i
talk
this
matter
over
so
that
it
is
properly
explained
i
thanked
captain
atkinson
for
his
services
and
was
left
alone
for
i
had
sent
timothy
to
ascertain
if
harcourt
had
arrived
safe
at
his
lodgings
never
did
i
feel
more
miserable
my
anxiety
for
harcourt
was
indescribable
true
he
had
not
treated
me
well
but
i
thought
of
his
venerable
father
who
pressed
my
hand
so
warmly
when
i
left
his
hospitable
roof
of
his
lovely
sisters
and
the
kindness
and
affection
which
they
had
shown
towards
me
and
our
extreme
intimacy
i
thought
of
the
pain
which
the
intelligence
would
give
them
and
their
indignation
towards
me
when
their
brother
first
made
his
appearance
at
his
house
mutilated
and
were
he
to
die
good
god
i
was
maddened
at
the
idea
i
had
now
undone
the
little
good
i
had
been
able
to
do
if
i
had
made
fleta
and
her
mother
happy
had
i
not
plunged
another
family
into
misery
part
two
chapter
thirty
this
is
a
strange
world
i
am
cut
by
a
man
of
no
character
because
he
is
fearful
that
i
should
injure
his
character
timothy
returned
and
brought
me
consolation
the
bleeding
had
not
recommenced
and
harcourt
was
in
tolerable
spirits
an
eminent
surgeon
had
been
sent
for
go
again
my
dear
timothy
and
as
you
are
intimate
with
harcourt
servant
you
will
be
able
to
find
out
what
they
are
about
timothy
departed
and
was
absent
about
an
hour
during
which
i
lay
on
the
sofa
and
groaned
with
anguish
when
he
returned
i
knew
by
his
face
that
his
intelligence
was
favourable
all
right
cried
timothy
no
amputation
after
all
it
was
only
one
of
the
smaller
arteries
which
was
severed
and
they
have
taken
it
up
i
sprang
up
from
the
sofa
and
embraced
timothy
so
happy
was
i
with
the
intelligence
and
then
i
sat
down
again
and
cried
like
a
child
at
last
i
became
more
composed
i
had
asked
captain
atkinson
to
dine
with
me
and
was
very
glad
when
he
came
he
confirmed
timothy
report
and
i
was
so
overjoyed
that
i
sat
late
at
dinner
drinking
very
freely
and
when
he
again
proposed
that
we
should
go
to
the
et
table
i
did
not
refuse
on
the
contrary
flushed
with
wine
i
was
anxious
to
go
and
took
all
the
money
that
i
had
with
me
on
our
arrival
atkinson
played
but
finding
that
he
was
not
fortunate
he
very
soon
left
off
as
i
had
followed
his
game
i
also
had
lost
considerably
and
he
entreated
me
not
to
play
any
more
but
was
a
it
appeared
and
i
would
not
pay
attention
to
him
and
did
not
quit
the
table
until
i
had
lost
every
shilling
in
my
pocket
i
left
the
house
in
no
very
good
humour
and
atkinson
who
had
waited
for
me
accompanied
me
home
newland
said
he
i
do
know
what
you
may
think
of
me
you
may
have
heard
that
i
a
etcetera
etcetera
etcetera
but
this
i
always
do
which
is
caution
those
who
are
gamesters
from
their
hearts
i
have
watched
you
and
i
tell
you
that
you
will
be
ruined
if
you
continue
to
frequent
that
table
you
have
no
command
over
yourself
i
do
not
know
what
your
means
may
be
but
this
i
do
know
that
if
you
were
a
croesus
you
would
be
a
beggar
i
cared
nothing
for
you
while
you
were
the
mr
newland
the
admired
and
leader
of
the
fashion
but
i
felt
for
you
when
i
heard
that
you
were
scouted
from
society
merely
because
it
was
found
out
that
you
were
not
so
rich
as
you
were
supposed
to
be
i
had
a
fellow
feeling
as
i
told
you
i
did
not
make
your
acquaintance
to
win
your
money
i
can
win
as
much
as
i
wish
from
the
scoundrels
who
keep
the
tables
or
from
those
who
would
not
scruple
to
plunder
others
and
i
now
entreat
you
not
to
return
to
that
place
and
am
sorry
very
sorry
that
ever
i
took
you
there
to
me
the
excitement
is
nothing
to
you
it
is
overpowering
you
are
a
gamester
or
rather
you
have
it
in
your
disposition
take
therefore
the
advice
of
a
friend
if
i
may
so
call
myself
and
do
not
go
there
again
i
hope
you
are
not
seriously
inconvenienced
by
what
you
have
lost
not
the
least
replied
i
it
was
ready
money
i
thank
you
for
your
advice
and
will
follow
it
i
have
been
a
fool
and
one
folly
is
sufficient
atkinson
then
left
me
i
had
lost
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
which
included
my
winnings
of
the
night
before
i
was
annoyed
at
it
but
i
thought
of
harcourt
safety
and
felt
indifferent
the
reader
may
recollect
that
i
had
three
thousand
pounds
which
mr
masterton
had
offered
to
put
out
at
mortgage
for
me
but
until
he
could
find
an
opportunity
by
his
advice
i
had
bought
stock
in
the
three
per
cents
since
that
time
he
had
not
succeeded
as
mortgages
in
general
are
for
larger
sums
and
it
had
therefore
remained
my
rents
were
not
yet
due
and
i
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
this
money
i
therefore
went
into
the
city
and
ordered
the
broker
to
sell
out
two
hundred
pounds
intending
to
replace
it
as
soon
as
i
could
for
i
would
not
have
liked
that
mr
masterton
should
have
known
that
i
had
lost
money
by
gambling
when
i
returned
from
the
city
i
found
captain
atkinson
in
my
apartments
waiting
for
me
harcourt
is
doing
well
and
you
are
not
doing
badly
i
have
let
all
the
world
know
that
you
intend
to
call
out
whoever
presumes
to
treat
you
with
indifference
the
devil
you
have
but
that
is
a
threat
which
may
easier
be
made
than
followed
up
by
deeds
shoot
two
or
three
more
replied
atkinson
coolly
and
then
depend
upon
it
you
have
it
all
your
own
way
as
it
is
i
acknowledge
there
has
been
some
show
of
resistance
and
they
talk
of
making
a
resolution
not
to
meet
you
on
the
score
of
your
being
an
impostor
and
a
very
plausible
reason
too
replied
i
nor
do
i
think
i
have
any
right
i
am
sure
i
have
no
intention
of
doing
as
you
propose
surely
people
have
a
right
to
choose
their
acquaintance
and
to
cut
me
if
they
think
i
have
done
wrong
i
am
afraid
captain
atkinson
you
have
mistaken
me
i
have
punished
harcourt
for
his
conduct
towards
me
he
deserved
punishment
i
had
claims
on
him
but
i
have
not
upon
the
hundreds
whom
when
in
the
zenith
of
my
popularity
i
myself
perhaps
was
not
over
courteous
to
i
can
not
the
which
you
propose
nor
do
i
consider
that
i
shall
help
my
character
by
so
doing
i
may
become
notorious
but
certainly
i
shall
not
obtain
that
species
of
notoriety
which
will
be
of
service
to
me
no
no
i
have
done
too
much
i
may
say
already
and
although
not
so
much
to
blame
as
the
world
imagines
yet
my
own
conscience
tells
me
that
by
allowing
it
to
suppose
that
i
was
what
i
was
not
i
have
to
say
the
least
been
a
party
to
the
fraud
and
must
take
the
consequence
my
situation
now
is
very
unpleasant
and
i
ought
to
retire
and
if
possible
with
real
claims
upon
the
public
favour
i
have
still
friends
thank
god
and
influential
friends
i
am
offered
a
writership
in
india
a
commission
in
the
army
or
to
study
the
law
will
you
favour
me
with
your
opinion
you
pay
me
a
compliment
by
asking
my
advice
a
writership
in
india
is
fourteen
years
transportation
returning
with
plenty
to
live
on
but
no
health
to
enjoy
it
in
the
army
you
might
do
well
and
moreover
as
an
officer
in
the
army
none
dare
refuse
to
go
out
with
you
at
the
same
time
under
your
peculiar
circumstances
i
think
if
you
were
in
a
crack
regiment
you
would
in
all
probability
have
to
fight
one
half
the
mess
and
be
put
in
coventry
by
the
other
you
must
then
exchange
on
and
your
commission
would
be
a
great
help
to
you
as
for
the
law
i
sooner
see
a
brother
of
mine
in
his
coffin
there
you
have
my
opinion
not
a
very
encouraging
one
at
all
events
replied
i
laughing
but
there
is
much
truth
in
your
observations
to
india
i
will
not
go
as
it
will
interfere
with
the
great
object
of
my
existence
and
pray
if
it
be
no
secret
may
i
ask
what
that
is
to
find
out
is
my
captain
atkinson
looked
very
hard
at
me
i
more
than
once
said
he
have
thought
you
a
little
cracked
but
now
i
perceive
you
are
downright
do
be
angry
i
could
help
saying
so
and
if
you
wish
me
to
give
you
satisfaction
i
shall
most
unwillingly
oblige
you
no
no
atkinson
i
believe
you
are
not
very
far
wrong
and
i
forgive
you
but
to
proceed
the
army
as
you
say
will
give
me
a
position
in
society
from
my
profession
being
that
of
a
gentleman
but
as
i
do
not
wish
to
take
the
advantage
which
you
have
suggested
from
the
position
i
shrink
from
putting
myself
into
one
which
may
lead
to
much
mortification
as
for
the
law
although
i
do
not
exactly
agree
with
you
in
your
abhorrence
of
the
profession
yet
i
must
say
that
i
do
not
like
the
idea
i
have
been
rendered
unfit
for
it
by
my
life
up
to
the
present
but
i
am
permitted
to
select
any
other
without
wishing
to
pry
into
your
affairs
have
you
sufficient
to
live
upon
yes
in
a
moderate
way
about
a
younger
brother
portion
which
will
just
keep
me
in
gloves
cigars
and
eau
de
cologne
then
take
my
advice
and
be
the
only
difference
i
can
see
between
a
gentleman
and
anybody
else
is
that
one
is
idle
and
the
other
works
hard
one
is
a
useless
and
the
other
a
useful
member
of
society
such
is
the
absurdity
of
the
opinions
of
the
world
yes
i
agree
with
you
and
would
prefer
being
a
gentleman
in
that
respect
and
do
nothing
if
they
would
admit
me
in
every
other
but
that
they
will
not
do
i
am
in
an
unfortunate
position
and
will
be
until
your
feelings
become
blunted
as
mine
have
been
replied
atkinson
had
you
acquiesced
in
my
proposal
you
would
have
done
better
as
it
is
i
can
be
of
no
use
to
you
nay
without
intending
an
affront
i
do
not
know
if
we
ought
to
be
seen
together
for
your
decision
not
to
your
way
is
rather
awkward
as
i
can
not
back
one
with
my
who
will
not
do
credit
to
it
do
not
be
angry
at
what
i
say
you
are
your
own
master
and
have
a
right
to
decide
for
yourself
if
you
think
yourself
not
so
wholly
lost
as
to
be
able
eventually
to
recover
yourself
by
other
means
i
do
not
blame
you
as
i
know
it
is
only
from
an
error
in
judgment
and
not
from
want
of
courage
at
present
i
am
i
acknowledge
lost
captain
atkinson
but
if
i
succeed
in
finding
my
father
good
morning
newland
good
morning
replied
he
hastily
i
see
how
it
is
of
course
we
shall
be
civil
to
each
other
when
we
meet
for
i
wish
you
well
but
we
must
not
be
seen
together
or
you
may
injure
my
character
injure
character
captain
atkinson
yes
mr
newland
injure
my
character
i
do
not
mean
to
say
but
that
there
are
characters
more
respectable
but
i
have
a
character
which
suits
me
and
it
has
the
merit
of
consistency
as
you
are
not
prepared
as
the
americans
say
go
the
whole
we
will
part
good
friends
and
if
i
have
said
anything
to
annoy
you
i
beg
your
pardon
then
captain
atkinson
for
the
kindness
you
have
shown
me
i
am
grateful
he
shook
my
hand
and
walked
out
of
the
room
and
for
having
thus
broken
up
our
acquaintance
more
grateful
still
thought
i
as
he
went
down
stairs
part
three
chapter
one
i
cut
my
new
acquaintance
but
his
company
even
in
so
short
a
time
proves
my
ruin
notwithstanding
i
part
with
all
my
property
i
retain
my
honesty
in
the
mean
time
the
particulars
of
the
duel
had
found
their
way
into
the
papers
with
various
comments
but
none
of
them
very
flattering
to
me
and
i
received
a
note
from
mr
masterton
who
deceived
by
the
representations
of
that
class
of
people
who
cater
for
newspapers
and
who
are
but
too
glad
to
pull
if
they
possibly
can
everyone
to
their
own
level
strongly
animadverted
upon
my
conduct
and
pointed
out
the
folly
of
it
adding
that
lord
windermear
wholly
coincided
with
him
in
opinion
and
had
desired
him
to
express
his
displeasure
he
concluded
by
observing
i
consider
this
to
be
the
most
serious
false
step
which
you
have
hitherto
made
because
you
have
been
a
party
to
deceiving
the
public
and
because
one
individual
who
had
no
objection
to
be
intimate
with
a
young
man
of
fashion
station
and
affluence
does
not
wish
to
continue
the
acquaintance
with
one
of
unknown
birth
and
no
fortune
you
consider
yourself
justified
in
taking
his
life
upon
this
principle
all
society
is
at
an
end
all
distinctions
levelled
and
the
rule
of
the
gladiator
will
only
be
overthrown
by
the
stiletto
of
the
assassin
i
was
but
ill
prepared
to
receive
this
letter
i
had
been
deeply
thinking
upon
the
kind
offers
of
lord
windermear
and
had
felt
that
they
would
interfere
with
the
of
my
existence
and
i
was
reflecting
by
what
means
i
could
evade
their
kind
intentions
and
be
at
liberty
to
follow
my
own
inclinations
when
this
note
arrived
to
me
it
appeared
to
be
the
height
of
injustice
i
had
been
arraigned
and
found
guilty
upon
an
statement
i
forgot
at
the
time
that
it
was
my
duty
to
have
immediately
proceeded
to
mr
masterton
and
have
fully
explained
the
facts
of
the
case
and
that
by
not
having
so
done
i
left
the
natural
impression
that
i
had
no
defence
to
offer
i
forgot
all
this
still
i
was
myself
to
blame
i
only
saw
that
the
letter
in
itself
was
unkind
and
unjust
and
my
feelings
were
those
of
resentment
what
right
have
lord
windermear
and
mr
masterton
thus
to
school
and
to
insult
me
the
right
of
obligations
conferred
but
is
not
lord
windermear
under
obligations
to
me
have
i
not
preserved
his
secret
yes
but
how
did
i
obtain
possession
of
it
by
so
doing
i
was
only
making
reparation
for
an
act
of
treachery
well
then
at
all
events
i
have
a
right
to
be
independent
of
them
if
i
please
anyone
has
a
right
to
assert
his
independence
if
he
chooses
their
offers
or
service
only
would
shackle
me
if
i
accepted
of
their
assistance
i
will
have
none
of
them
such
were
my
reflections
and
the
reader
must
perceive
that
i
was
influenced
by
a
state
of
morbid
irritability
a
sense
of
abandonment
which
prostrated
me
i
felt
that
i
was
an
isolated
being
without
a
tie
in
the
whole
world
i
determined
to
spurn
the
world
as
it
had
spurned
me
to
timothy
i
would
hardly
speak
a
word
i
lay
with
an
aching
head
aching
from
increased
circulation
i
was
mad
or
nearly
so
i
opened
the
case
of
pistols
and
thought
of
suicide
reflection
alone
restrained
me
i
could
not
abandon
the
search
after
my
father
feverish
and
impatient
i
wished
to
walk
out
but
i
dared
not
meet
the
public
eye
i
waited
till
dark
and
then
i
sallied
forth
hardly
knowing
where
i
went
i
passed
the
gaming
house
i
did
pass
it
but
i
returned
and
lost
every
shilling
not
however
till
the
fluctuations
of
the
game
had
persuaded
me
that
had
i
had
more
money
to
carry
it
on
i
should
have
won
i
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
i
thought
of
how
i
had
been
caressed
and
admired
when
i
was
supposed
to
be
rich
of
what
use
then
was
the
money
i
possessed
little
or
none
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
either
gain
a
fortune
or
lose
that
which
i
had
the
next
morning
i
went
into
the
city
and
sold
out
all
the
remaining
stock
to
timothy
i
had
not
communicated
my
intentions
i
studiously
avoided
speaking
to
him
he
felt
hurt
at
my
conduct
i
perceived
but
i
was
afraid
of
his
advice
and
expostulation
at
i
returned
to
the
hell
played
with
various
success
at
one
time
was
a
winner
of
three
times
my
capital
and
i
ended
at
last
with
my
pockets
being
empty
i
was
indifferent
when
it
was
all
gone
although
in
the
highest
state
of
excitement
while
the
chances
were
turning
up
the
next
day
i
went
to
a
and
stated
my
wish
to
sell
my
house
for
i
was
resolved
to
try
fortune
to
the
last
the
agent
undertook
to
find
a
ready
purchaser
and
i
begged
an
advance
which
he
made
and
continued
to
make
until
he
had
advanced
nearly
half
the
value
he
then
found
a
purchaser
himself
as
i
believe
at
two
thirds
of
its
value
i
did
not
hesitate
i
had
lost
every
advance
one
after
another
and
was
anxious
to
retrieve
my
fortune
or
be
a
beggar
i
signed
the
conveyance
and
received
the
balance
fifteen
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
returned
to
the
apartments
no
longer
mine
about
an
hour
before
dinner
i
called
timothy
and
ascertaining
the
amount
of
bills
due
gave
him
fifty
pounds
which
left
him
about
fifteen
pounds
as
a
residue
i
then
sat
down
to
my
solitary
meal
but
just
as
i
commenced
i
heard
a
dispute
in
the
passage
what
is
that
timothy
cried
i
for
i
was
nervous

a
degree

his

behind

back
shaking
as
much
as
the
other
which
in
his
rage
he
shook
in
my
face
enraged

at
being
called
such
an
opprobrious
term
i
opened
the
door

him
round
and
applying
my
foot
to
a
nameless
part

assistance
of
timothy
whom
i
summoned
we
dragged
the
old
man
up

placed
him
in
a
chair

found
that
he
was
not
very
much
hurt
a
glass
of
wine

given
to
him

table
catching

looked

to
see

and
then
tore
it
up

a

five
hundred
pounds
more
and
now
we
are
quits
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
were
fixed
upon
me
in
astonishment
and
from
my
face
they
glanced
upon
the
notes
he
could
to
use
a
common
expression
neither
believe
his
eyes
nor
his
ears
at
last
he
took
the
money
again
unbuttoned
and
pulled
out
his
and
with
a
trembling
hand
stowed
them
away
as
before
you

world
again
and
to
seek
my
fortune
in
the
next
path
i
take
leave
of
all
my
old
friends
the
jew
retired
and
i
commenced
my
meal
when
the
door
again
slowly
opened
and
mr
emmanuel
crawled
up
to
me
mishter
newland
i
vash
beg
your
pardon
but
vill
you
not
pay
me
de
interest
of
de
monish
i
started
up
from
my
chair
with
my
rattan
in
my
hand
begone
you
old
thief
cried
i
and
hardly
were
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
before
mr
emmanuel
travelled
out
of
the
room
and
i
never
saw
him
afterwards
i
was
pleased
with
myself
for
having
done
this
act
of
honesty
and
for
the
first
time
for
a
long
while
i
ate
my
dinner
with
some
zest
after
i
had
finished
i
took
a
twenty
pound
note
and
laid
it
in
my
desk
the
remainder
of
the
five
hundred
pounds
i
put
in
my
pocket
to
try
my
last
chance
in
an
hour
i
quitted
the
hell
penniless
when
i
returned
home
i
had
composed
myself
a
little
after
the
dreadful
excitement
which
i
had
been
under
i
felt
a
calm
and
a
degree
of
negative
happiness
i
knew
my
fate
there
was
no
more
suspense
i
sat
down
to
reflect
upon
what
i
should
do
i
was
to
commence
the
world
again
to
sink
down
at
once
into
obscurity
into
poverty
and
i
felt
happy
i
had
severed
the
link
between
myself
and
my
former
condition
i
was
again
a
beggar
but
i
was
independent
and
i
resolved
so
to
be
i
spoke
kindly
to
timothy
went
to
bed
and
having
arranged
in
my
own
mind
how
i
should
act
i
fell
sound
asleep
i
never
slept
better
or
awoke
more
refreshed
the
next
morning
i
packed
up
my
portmanteau
taking
with
me
only
the
most
necessary
articles
all
the
details
of
the
toilet
further
than
cleanliness
was
concerned
i
abjured
when
timothy
came
in
i
told
him
that
i
was
going
down
to
lady
de
clare
which
i
intended
to
do
poor
timothy
was
overjoyed
at
the
change
in
my
manner
little
thinking
that
he
was
so
soon
to
lose
me
for
reader
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
try
my
fortunes
alone
and
painful
as
i
felt
would
be
the
parting
with
so
valued
a
friend
i
was
determined
that
i
would
no
longer
have
even
his
assistance
or
company
i
was
determined
to
forget
all
that
had
passed
and
commence
the
world
anew
i
sat
down
while
timothy
went
out
to
take
a
place
in
the
richmond
coach
and
wrote
to
him
the
following
letter
my
dear
timothy
do
not
think
that
i
undervalue
your
friendship
or
shall
ever
forget
your
regard
for
me
when
i
tell
you
that
we
shall
probably
never
meet
again
should
fortune
favour
me
i
trust
we
shall
but
of
that
there
is
little
prospect
i
have
lost
almost
everything
my
money
is
all
gone
my
house
is
sold
and
all
is
gambled
away
i
leave
you
with
only
my
clothes
in
my
portmanteau
and
twenty
pounds
for
yourself
there
is
the
furniture
which
you
must
sell
as
well
as
every
other
article
left
behind
it
is
all
yours
and
i
hope
you
will
find
means
to
establish
yourself
in
some
way
god
bless
you
and
believe
me
always
and
gratefully
yours
japhet
newland
this
letter
i
reserved
to
put
in
the
post
when
i
quitted
richmond
my
next
letter
was
to
mr
masterton
sir
your
note
i
received
and
i
am
afraid
that
unwittingly
you
have
been
the
occasion
of
my
present
condition
that
i
did
not
deserve
the
language
addressed
to
me
you
may
satisfy
yourself
by
applying
to
mr
harcourt
driven
to
desperation
i
have
lost
all
i
had
in
the
world
by
adding
gaming
to
my
many
follies
i
now
am
about
to
seek
my
fortune
and
prosecute
my
search
after
my
father
you
will
therefore
return
my
most
sincere
acknowledgments
to
lord
windermear
for
his
kind
offers
and
intentions
and
assure
him
that
my
feelings
towards
him
will
always
be
those
of
gratitude
and
respect
for
yourself
accept
my
warmest
thanks
for
the
friendly
advice
and
kind
interest
which
you
have
shown
in
my
welfare
and
believe
me
when
i
say
that
my
earnest
prayers
shall
be
offered
up
for
your
happiness
if
you
can
in
any
way
assist
my
poor
friend
timothy
who
will
i
have
no
doubt
fall
upon
you
in
his
distress
you
will
confer
an
additional
favour
on
yours
ever
gratefully
japhet
newland
i
sealed
this
letter
and
when
timothy
returned
i
told
him
that
i
wished
him
after
my
departure
to
take
it
to
mr
masterton
and
not
wait
for
an
answer
i
then
as
i
had
an
hour
to
spare
before
the
coach
started
entered
into
a
conversation
with
timothy
i
pointed
out
to
him
the
unfortunate
condition
in
which
i
found
myself
and
my
determination
to
quit
the
metropolis
timothy
agreed
with
me
i
have
seen
you
so
unhappy
of
late
i
may
say
so
miserable
that
i
have
neither
eaten
nor
slept
indeed
japhet
i
have
laid
in
bed
and
wept
for
my
happiness
depends
upon
yours
go
where
you
will
i
am
ready
to
follow
and
to
serve
you
and
as
long
as
i
see
you
comfortable
i
care
for
nothing
else
these
words
of
timothy
almost
shook
my
resolution
and
i
was
near
telling
him
all
but
when
i
recollected
i
refrained
my
dear
timothy
said
i
in
this
world
we
must
expect
to
meet
with
a
checkered
existence
we
may
laugh
at
one
time
but
we
must
cry
at
others
i
owe
my
life
to
you
and
i
never
shall
forget
you
wherever
i
may
be
no
replied
timothy
you
are
not
likely
to
forget
one
who
is
hardly
an
hour
out
of
your
sight
very
true
timothy
but
circumstances
may
occur
which
may
separate
us
i
can
not
imagine
such
circumstances
nor
do
i
believe
that
bad
as
things
may
turn
out
that
they
will
ever
be
so
bad
as
that
you
have
your
money
and
your
house
if
you
leave
london
you
will
be
able
to
add
to
your
income
by
letting
your
own
apartments
furnished
so
we
never
shall
want
and
we
may
be
very
happy
running
about
the
world
seeking
what
we
wish
to
find
my
heart
smote
me
when
timothy
said
this
for
i
felt
by
his
devotion
and
fidelity
he
had
almost
the
same
claim
to
the
property
i
possessed
as
myself
he
had
been
my
partner
playing
the
inferior
game
for
the
mutual
benefit
but
the
time
may
come
timothy
when
we
may
find
ourselves
without
money
as
we
were
when
we
first
commenced
our
career
and
shared
halfpenny
each
by
selling
the
old
woman
the
embrocation
well
sir
and
let
it
come
i
should
be
sorry
for
you
but
not
for
myself
for
then
tim
would
be
of
more
importance
and
more
useful
than
as
valet
with
little
or
nothing
to
do
i
mentally
exclaimed
i
have
i
think
i
have
been
a
fool
a
great
fool
but
the
die
is
cast
i
will
sow
in
sorrow
and
may
i
reap
a
harvest
in
joy
i
feel
thought
i
and
i
did
feel
i
feel
a
delightful
conviction
that
we
shall
meet
again
and
all
this
misery
of
parting
will
be
but
a
subject
of
future
garrulity
yes
tim
said
i
in
a
loud
voice
all
is
right
all
right
sir
i
never
thought
anything
was
wrong
except
your
annoyance
at
people
not
paying
you
the
attention
which
they
used
to
do
when
they
supposed
you
a
man
of
fortune
very
true
and
tim
recollect
that
if
mr
masterton
speaks
to
you
about
me
which
he
may
after
i
am
gone
to
richmond
you
tell
him
that
before
i
left
i
paid
that
old
scoundrel
emmanuel
every
farthing
that
i
had
borrowed
of
him
and
you
know
and
in
fact
so
does
mr
masterton
how
it
was
borrowed
well
sir
i
will
if
he
does
talk
to
me
but
he
seldom
says
much
to
me
but
he
may
perhaps
tim
and
i
wish
him
to
know
that
i
have
paid
every
debt
i
owe
in
the
world
one
would
think
that
you
were
going
to
the
east
indies
instead
of
to
richmond
by
the
way
you
talk
no
tim
i
was
offered
a
situation
in
the
east
indies
and
i
refused
it
but
mr
masterton
and
i
have
not
been
on
good
terms
lately
and
i
wish
him
to
know
that
i
am
out
of
debt
you
know
for
i
told
you
all
that
passed
between
emmanuel
and
myself
how
he
accepted
five
hundred
pounds
and
i
paid
him
the
thousand
and
i
wish
mr
masterton
should
know
it
too
and
he
will
then
be
better
pleased
with
me
never
fear
sir
said
tim
i
can
tell
the
whole
story
with
flourishes
no
tim
nothing
but
the
truth
but
it
is
time
i
should
go
farewell
my
dear
fellow
may
god
bless
you
and
preserve
you
and
overcome
by
my
feelings
i
dropped
my
face
on
timothy
shoulder
and
wept
what
is
the
matter
what
do
you
mean
japhet
mr
newland
pray
sir
what
is
the
matter
timothy
it
is
nothing
replied
i
recovering
myself
but
i
have
been
ill
nervous
lately
as
you
well
know
and
even
leaving
the
last
and
only
friend
i
have
i
may
say
for
a
few
days
annoys
and
overcomes
me
oh
sir
dear
japhet
do
let
us
leave
this
house
and
sell
your
furniture
and
be
off
i
mean
that
it
shall
be
so
tim
god
bless
you
and
farewell
i
went
down
stairs
the
was
at
the
door
timothy
put
in
my
portmanteau
and
mounted
the
box
i
my
readers
may
despise
me
but
they
ought
not
let
them
be
in
my
situation
and
feel
that
they
have
one
sincere
faithful
friend
and
then
they
will
know
the
bitterness
of
parting
i
recovered
myself
before
i
arrived
at
the
coach
and
shaking
hands
with
timothy
i
lost
sight
of
him
for
how
long
the
reader
will
find
out
in
the
sequel
of
my
adventures
i
arrived
at
lady
de
clare
and
hardly
need
say
that
i
was
well
received
they
expressed
their
delight
at
my
so
soon
coming
again
and
made
a
hundred
inquiries
but
i
was
unhappy
and
melancholy
not
at
my
prospects
for
in
my
infatuation
i
rejoiced
at
my
anticipated
beggary
but
i
wished
to
communicate
with
fleta
for
so
i
still
call
her
fleta
had
known
my
history
for
she
had
been
present
when
i
had
related
it
to
her
mother
up
to
the
time
that
i
arrived
in
london
further
than
that
she
knew
little
i
was
determined
that
before
i
quitted
she
should
know
all
i
dared
not
trust
the
last
part
to
her
when
i
was
present
but
i
resolved
that
i
would
do
it
in
writing
lady
de
clare
made
no
difficulty
whatever
of
leaving
me
with
fleta
she
was
now
a
beautiful
creature
of
between
fifteen
and
sixteen
bursting
into
womanhood
and
lovely
as
the
bud
of
the
and
she
was
precocious
beyond
her
years
in
i
staid
there
three
days
and
had
frequent
opportunities
of
conversing
with
her
i
told
her
that
i
wished
her
to
be
acquainted
with
my
whole
life
and
interrogated
her
as
to
what
she
knew
i
carefully
filled
up
the
chasms
until
i
brought
it
down
to
the
time
at
which
i
placed
her
in
the
arms
of
her
mother
and
now
fleta
said
i
you
have
much
more
to
learn
you
will
learn
that
much
at
my
departure
i
have
dedicated
hours
every
night
in
writing
it
out
and
as
you
will
find
have
analysed
my
feelings
and
have
pointed
out
to
you
where
i
have
been
wrong
i
have
done
it
for
my
amusement
as
it
may
be
of
service
even
to
a
female
on
the
third
day
i
took
my
leave
and
requesting
the
pony
chaise
of
lady
de
clare
to
take
me
over
to
that
i
might
catch
the
first
coach
that
went
westward
for
i
did
not
care
which
i
put
into
fleta
hands
the
packet
which
i
had
written
containing
all
that
had
passed
and
i
bid
her
farewell
lady
de
clare
may
you
be
happy
said
i
fleta
cecilia
i
should
say
may
god
bless
and
preserve
you
and
sometimes
think
of
your
sincere
friend
japhet
newland
really
mr
newland
said
lady
de
clare
one
would
think
we
were
never
to
see
you
again
i
hope
that
will
not
be
the
case
lady
de
clare
for
i
know
nobody
to
whom
i
am
more
devoted
then
sir
recollect
we
are
to
see
you
very
soon
i
pressed
her
ladyship
hand
and
left
the
house
thus
did
i
commence
my
second
pilgrimage
part
three
chapter
three
my
new
career
is
not
very
prosperous
at
its
commencement
i
am
robbed
and
accused
of
being
a
robber
i
bind
up
wounds
and
am
accused
of
having
inflicted
them
i
get
into
a
and
out
of
it
into
gaol
i
had
proceeded
half
a
mile
from
the
house
when
i
desired
the
servant
to
turn
into
a
so
as
to
gain
brentford
and
so
soon
as
i
arrived
the
distance
being
only
four
miles
i
ordered
him
to
stop
at
a
saying
that
i
would
wait
till
the
coach
should
pass
by
i
then
gave
him
and
ordered
him
to
go
home
i
went
into
the
inn
with
my
portmanteau
and
was
shown
into
a
small
back
parlour
there
i
remained
about
half
an
hour
reflecting
upon
the
best
plan
that
i
could
adopt
leaving
the
ale
that
i
had
called
for
untasted
i
paid
for
it
and
with
the
portmanteau
on
my
shoulder
i
walked
away
until
i
arrived
at
an
old
clothes
shop
i
told
the
jew
who
kept
it
that
i
required
some
clothes
and
also
wanted
to
dispose
of
my
own
portmanteau
and
all
my
effects
i
had
a
great
rogue
to
deal
with
but
after
much
chaffering
for
i
now
felt
the
value
of
money
i
purchased
from
him
two
pair
of
corduroy
trowsers
two
waistcoats
four
common
shirts
four
pairs
of
stockings
a
smock
frock
a
pair
of
and
a
common
hat
for
these
i
gave
up
all
my
portmanteau
with
the
exception
of
six
silk
hand
kerchiefs
and
received
fifty
shillings
when
i
ought
to
have
received
at
least
ten
pounds
but
i
could
not
well
help
myself
and
i
submitted
to
the
extortion
i
dressed
myself
in
my
more
humble
garments
securing
my
money
in
the
pocket
of
my
trowsers
unobserved
by
the
jew
made
up
a
bundle
of
the
rest
and
procured
a
stick
from
the
jew
to
carry
it
on
however
not
without
paying
him
for
it
he
observing
that
the
stick
wash
not
in
de
bargain
thus
attired
i
had
the
appearance
of
a
countryman
well
to
do
and
i
set
off
through
the
long
dirty
main
street
of
brentford
quite
undecided
and
indifferent
as
to
the
direction
i
should
take
i
walked
about
a
mile
when
i
thought
that
it
was
better
to
come
to
some
decision
previous
to
my
going
farther
and
perceiving
a
bench
in
front
of
a
i
went
to
it
and
sat
down
i
looked
around
and
it
immediately
came
to
my
recollection
that
i
was
sitting
on
the
very
bench
on
which
timothy
and
i
had
stopped
to
eat
our
meal
of
pork
at
our
first
outset
upon
our
travels
yes
it
was
the
very
same
here
sat
i
and
there
sat
timothy
two
heedless
boys
with
the
paper
containing
the
meat
the
loaf
of
bread
and
the
pot
of
beer
between
us
poor
timothy
i
conjured
up
his
unhappiness
when
he
had
received
my
note
acquainting
him
with
our
future
separation
i
remembered
his
fidelity
his
courage
in
defence
and
his
preservation
of
my
life
in
ireland
and
a
tear
or
two
coursed
down
my
cheek
i
remained
some
time
in
a
deep
reverie
during
which
the
various
circumstances
and
adventures
of
my
life
passed
in
a
rapid
panorama
before
me
i
felt
that
i
had
little
to
plead
in
my
own
favour
much
to
condemn
that
i
had
passed
a
life
of
fraud
and
deceit
i
also
could
not
forget
that
when
i
had
returned
to
honesty
i
had
been
scouted
by
the
world
and
here
i
am
thought
i
once
more
with
the
world
before
me
and
it
is
just
that
i
should
commence
again
for
i
started
in
a
wrong
path
at
least
now
i
can
satisfactorily
assert
that
i
am
deceiving
nobody
and
can
deservedly
receive
no
contumely
i
am
japhet
newland
and
not
in
disguise
i
felt
happy
with
this
reflection
and
made
a
determination
whatever
my
future
lot
might
be
that
at
least
i
would
pursue
the
path
of
honesty
i
then
began
to
reflect
upon
another
point
which
was
whither
i
should
bend
my
steps
and
what
i
should
do
to
gain
my
livelihood
alas
that
was
a
subject
of
no
little
difficulty
to
me
a
person
who
has
been
brought
up
to
a
profession
naturally
reverts
to
that
profession
but
to
what
had
i
been
brought
up
as
an
apothecary
true
but
i
well
knew
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
employment
in
what
is
termed
a
liberal
profession
without
interest
or
recommendation
neither
did
i
wish
for
close
confinement
as
the
very
idea
was
irksome
as
a
mountebank
a
juggler
a
quack
doctor
i
spurned
the
very
idea
it
was
a
system
of
fraud
and
deceit
what
then
could
i
do
i
could
not
dig
to
beg
i
was
ashamed
i
must
trust
to
the
chapter
of
accidents
and
considering
how
helpless
i
was
such
trust
was
but
a
broken
reed
at
all
events
i
had
a
sufficient
sum
of
money
upwards
of
twenty
pounds
to
exist
upon
with
economy
for
some
time
i
was
interrupted
by
a
voice
calling
out
hilloa
my
lad
come
and
hold
this
horse
a
moment
i
looked
up
and
perceived
a
person
on
horseback
looking
at
me
do
you
hear
or
are
you
stupid
cried
the
man
my
first
feeling
was
to
knock
him
down
for
his
impertinence
but
my
bundle
lying
beside
reminded
me
of
my
situation
and
appearance
and
i
rose
and
walked
towards
the
horse
the
gentleman
for
such
he
was
in
appearance
dismounted
and
throwing
the
rein
on
the
horse
neck
told
me
to
stand
by
him
for
half
a
minute
he
went
into
a
respectable
looking
house
opposite
the
inn
and
remained
nearly
half
an
hour
during
which
i
was
becoming
very
impatient
and
kept
an
anxious
eye
upon
my
bundle
which
lay
on
the
seat
at
last
he
came
out
and
mounting
his
horse
looked
in
my
face
with
some
degree
of
surprise
why
what
are
you
said
he
as
he
pulled
out
a
sixpence
and
tendered
it
to
me
i
was
again
nearly
forgetting
myself
affronted
at
the
idea
of
sixpence
being
offered
to
me
but
i
recovered
myself
saying
as
i
took
it
a
poor
labouring
man
sir
what
with
those
hands
said
he
looking
at
them
as
i
took
the
money
and
then
looking
at
my
face
he
continued
i
think
we
have
met
before
my
lad
i
can
not
be
sure
you
know
best
i
am
a
bow
street
magistrate
in
a
moment
i
remembered
that
he
was
the
very
magistrate
before
whom
i
had
twice
made
my
appearance
i
coloured
deeply
and
made
no
reply
well
my
lad
i
not
on
my
bench
now
and
this
sixpence
you
have
earned
honestly
i
trust
you
will
continue
in
the
right
path
be
careful
i
have
sharp
eyes
so
saying
he
rode
off
i
never
felt
more
mortified
it
was
evident
that
he
considered
me
as
one
who
was
acting
a
part
for
unworthy
purposes
perhaps
one
of
the
swell
mob
or
a
flash
pickpocket
rusticating
until
some
hue
and
cry
was
over
well
well
thought
i
as
i
took
up
a
lump
of
dirt
and
rubbed
over
my
then
white
hands
it
is
my
fate
to
be
believed
when
i
deceive
and
to
be
mistrusted
when
i
am
acting
honestly
and
i
returned
to
the
bench
for
my
bundle
which
was
gone
i
stared
with
astonishment
is
it
possible
thought
i
how
dishonest
people
are
well
i
will
not
carry
another
for
the
present
they
might
as
well
have
left
me
my
stick
so
thinking
and
without
any
great
degree
of
annoyance
at
the
loss
i
turned
from
the
bench
and
walked
away
i
knew
not
whither
it
was
now
getting
dark
but
i
quite
forgot
that
it
was
necessary
to
look
out
for
a
lodging
the
fact
is
that
i
had
been
completely
upset
by
the
observations
of
the
magistrate
and
the
theft
of
my
bundle
and
in
a
sort
of
brown
study
from
which
i
was
occasionally
recalled
for
a
moment
by
stumbling
over
various
obstructions
i
continued
my
walk
on
the
pathway
until
i
was
two
or
three
miles
away
from
brentford
i
was
within
a
mile
of
hounslow
when
i
was
roused
by
the
groans
of
some
person
and
it
being
now
dark
i
looked
round
trying
to
catch
by
the
ear
the
direction
in
which
to
offer
my
assistance
they
proceeded
from
the
other
side
of
a
hedge
and
i
crawled
through
where
i
found
a
man
lying
on
the
ground
covered
with
blood
about
the
head
and
breathing
heavily
i
untied
his
neckcloth
and
as
well
as
i
could
examined
his
condition
i
bound
his
handkerchief
round
his
head
and
perceiving
that
the
position
in
which
he
was
lying
was
very
unfavourable
his
head
and
boulders
being
much
lower
than
his
body
i
was
dragging
the
body
round
so
as
to
raise
those
parts
when
i
heard
footsteps
and
voices
shortly
after
four
people
burst
through
the
hedge
and
surrounded
me
that
is
him
i
swear
to
it
cried
an
immense
stout
man
seizing
me
that
is
the
other
fellow
who
attacked
me
and
ran
away
he
has
come
to
get
off
his
accomplice
and
now
we
just
nicked
them
both
you
are
very
much
mistaken
replied
i
and
you
have
no
need
to
hold
me
so
tight
i
heard
the
man
groan
and
i
came
to
his
assistance
that
gammon
wo
do
replied
one
of
them
who
was
a
constable
you
come
along
with
us
and
we
may
as
well
put
on
the
continued
he
producing
a
pair
of
handcuffs
indignant
at
the
insult
i
suddenly
broke
from
him
who
held
me
and
darting
at
the
constable
knocked
him
down
and
then
took
to
my
heels
across
the
ploughed
field
the
whole
four
pursued
but
i
rather
gained
upon
them
and
was
in
hopes
to
make
my
escape
i
ran
for
a
gap
i
perceived
in
the
hedge
and
sprang
over
it
without
minding
the
old
adage
of
look
before
you
leap
for
when
on
the
other
side
i
found
myself
in
a
deep
and
stagnant
pit
of
water
and
mud
i
sank
over
head
and
with
difficulty
extricated
myself
from
the
mud
at
the
bottom
and
when
at
the
surface
i
was
equally
embarrassed
with
the
weeds
at
the
top
among
which
i
floundered
in
the
mean
time
my
pursuers
warned
by
the
loud
splash
had
paused
when
they
came
to
the
hedge
and
perceiving
my
situation
were
at
the
brink
of
the
pit
watching
for
my
coming
out
all
resistance
was
useless
i
was
numbed
with
cold
and
exhausted
by
my
struggles
and
when
i
gained
the
bank
i
surrendered
at
discretion
part
three
chapter
four
worse
and
worse
if
out
of
gaol
it
will
be
to
go
out
of
the
world
i
am
resolved
to
take
my
secret
with
me
the
handcuffs
were
now
put
on
without
resistance
on
my
part
and
i
was
led
away
to
hounslow
by
the
two
constables
while
the
others
returned
to
secure
the
wounded
man
on
my
arrival
i
was
thrust
into
the
clink
or
lockup
house
as
the
magistrates
would
not
meet
that
evening
and
there
i
was
left
to
my
reflections
previously
however
to
this
i
was
searched
and
my
money
amounting
as
i
before
stated
to
upwards
of
twenty
pounds
taken
from
me
by
the
constables
and
what
i
had
quite
forgotten
a
diamond
solitaire
ring
which
i
had
intended
to
have
left
with
my
other
bijouterie
for
timothy
but
in
my
hurry
when
i
left
london
i
had
allowed
to
remain
upon
my
finger
the
gaol
was
a
square
building
with
two
unglazed
windows
secured
with
thick
iron
bars
and
the
rain
having
beat
in
it
was
more
like
a
pound
for
cattle
for
it
was
not
even
paved
and
the
ground
was
three
or
four
inches
deep
in
mud
there
was
no
seat
in
it
and
there
i
was
the
whole
of
the
night
walking
up
and
down
shivering
in
my
wet
clothes
in
a
state
of
mind
almost
bordering
upon
insanity
reflect
upon
what
was
likely
to
happen
i
could
not
i
only
ran
over
the
past
i
remembered
what
i
had
been
and
felt
cruelly
the
situation
i
then
was
in
had
i
deserved
it
i
thought
not
oh
father
father
exclaimed
i
bitterly
see
to
what
your
son
is
brought
handcuffed
as
a
felon
god
have
mercy
on
my
brain
for
i
feel
that
it
is
wandering
father
father
alas
i
have
none
had
you
left
me
at
the
asylum
without
any
clue
or
hopes
of
a
clue
to
my
hereafter
being
reclaimed
it
would
have
been
a
kindness
i
should
then
have
been
happy
and
contented
in
some
obscure
situation
but
you
raised
hopes
only
to
prostrate
them
and
imaginings
which
have
led
to
my
destruction
sacred
is
the
duty
of
a
parent
and
heavy
must
be
the
account
of
those
who
desert
their
children
and
are
required
by
heaven
to
render
up
an
account
of
the
important
trust
couldst
thou
oh
father
but
now
behold
thy
son
god
almighty
but
i
will
not
curse
you
father
no
no
and
i
burst
into
tears
as
i
leant
against
the
damp
walls
of
the
prison
the
day
at
last
broke
and
the
sun
rose
and
poured
his
beaming
rays
through
the
barred
windows
i
looked
at
myself
and
was
shocked
at
my
appearance
my
was
covered
with
black
mud
my
clothes
were
equally
disfigured
i
had
lost
my
hat
when
in
the
water
and
i
felt
the
dry
mud
cracking
on
my
cheeks
i
put
my
hands
up
to
my
head
and
i
pulled
a
quantity
of
out
of
my
matted
and
tangled
hair
i
thought
of
the
appearance
i
should
make
when
summoned
before
the
magistrates
and
how
much
it
would
go
against
me
good
god
thought
i
who
of
all
the
world
of
fashion
who
of
all
those
who
once
caught
my
salutation
so
eagerly
who
of
all
those
girls
who
smiled
upon
me
but
one
short
twelve
months
since
would
imagine
or
believe
that
japhet
newland
could
ever
have
sunk
so
low
and
how
has
he
so
fallen
alas
because
he
would
be
honest
and
had
strength
of
mind
enough
to
adhere
to
his
resolution
well
well
god
will
be
done
i
care
not
for
life
but
still
an
ignominious
death
to
go
out
of
the
world
like
a
dog
and
that
too
without
finding
out
who
is
my
father
and
i
put
my
fettered
hands
up
and
pressed
my
burning
brow
and
remained
in
a
sort
of
apathetic
sullen
mood
until
i
was
startled
by
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
appearance
of
the
constables
they
led
me
out
among
the
crowd
through
which
with
difficulty
they
could
force
their
way
and
followed
by
the
majority
of
the
population
of
hounslow
who
made
their
complimentary
remarks
upon
the
i
was
brought
before
the
magistrates
the
large
stout
man
was
then
called
up
to
give
his
evidence
and
deposed
as
follows
that
he
was
walking
to
hounslow
from
brentford
whither
he
had
been
to
purchase
some
clothes
when
he
was
accosted
by
two
fellows
in
one
of
whom
carried
a
bundle
in
his
left
hand
they
asked
him
what
it
was
and
he
took
out
his
watch
to
tell
them
when
he
received
a
blow
from
the
one
with
the
bundle
this
one
sir
said
he
pointing
to
me
on
the
back
of
his
head
at
the
same
time
the
other
the
wounded
man
who
was
now
in
custody
snatched
his
watch
that
at
the
time
he
had
purchased
his
clothes
at
brentford
he
had
also
bought
a
bag
of
shot
fourteen
pounds
weight
which
he
had
for
the
convenience
of
carrying
tied
up
with
the
clothes
in
the
bundle
and
perceiving
that
he
was
about
to
be
robbed
he
had
swung
his
bundle
round
his
head
and
with
the
weight
of
the
shot
had
knocked
down
the
man
who
had
snatched
at
his
watch
he
then
turned
to
the
other
me
who
backed
from
him
and
struck
at
him
with
his
stick
the
stick
was
here
produced
and
when
i
cast
my
eye
on
it
i
was
horrified
to
perceive
that
it
was
the
very
stick
which
i
had
bought
of
the
jew
for
to
carry
my
bundle
on
he
had
closed
in
with
me
and
was
wresting
the
stick
out
of
my
hand
when
the
other
man
who
had
recovered
his
legs
again
attacked
him
with
another
stick
in
the
scuffle
he
had
obtained
my
stick
and
i
had
wrested
from
him
his
bundle
with
which
as
soon
as
he
had
knocked
down
my
partner
i
ran
off
that
he
beat
my
partner
until
he
was
insensible
and
then
found
that
i
had
left
my
own
bundle
which
in
the
affray
i
had
thrown
on
one
side
he
then
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
hounslow
to
give
the
information
his
return
and
finding
me
with
the
other
man
is
already
known
to
the
readers
the
next
evidence
who
came
forward
was
the
jew
from
whom
i
had
bought
the
clothes
and
sold
my
own
he
narrated
all
that
had
occurred
and
swore
to
the
clothes
in
the
bundle
left
by
the
footpad
and
to
the
stick
which
he
had
sold
to
me
the
constable
then
produced
the
money
found
about
my
person
and
the
diamond
solitaire
ring
stating
my
attempt
to
escape
when
i
was
seized
the
magistrate
then
asked
me
whether
i
had
anything
to
say
in
my
defence
cautioning
me
not
to
commit
myself
i
replied
that
i
was
innocent
that
it
was
true
that
i
had
sold
my
own
clothes
and
had
purchased
those
of
the
jew
as
well
as
the
stick
that
i
had
been
asked
to
hold
the
horse
of
a
gentleman
when
sitting
on
a
bench
opposite
a
and
that
someone
had
stolen
my
bundle
and
my
stick
that
i
had
walked
on
towards
hounslow
and
in
assisting
a
whom
i
certainly
had
considered
as
having
been
attacked
by
others
i
had
merely
yielded
to
the
common
feelings
of
humanity
that
i
was
seized
when
performing
that
duty
and
should
willingly
have
accompanied
them
to
the
magistrate
had
not
they
attempted
to
put
on
handcuffs
at
which
my
feelings
were
roused
and
i
knocked
the
constable
down
and
made
my
attempt
to
escape
certainly
a
very
ingenious
defence
observed
one
of
the
magistrates
pray
where
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
in
came
the
very
gentleman
the
magistrate
at
bow
street
whose
horse
i
had
held
good
morning
mr
norman
you
have
just
come
in
time
to
render
us
your
assistance
we
have
a
very
deep
hand
to
deal
with
here
or
else
a
very
injured
person
i
can
not
tell
which
do
us
the
favour
to
look
over
these
informations
and
the
defence
of
the
prisoner
previous
to
our
asking
him
any
more
questions
the
bow
street
magistrate
complied
and
then
turned
to
me
but
i
was
so
disguised
with
mud
that
he
could
not
recognise
me
you
are
the
gentleman
sir
who
asked
me
to
hold
your
horse
said
i
i
call
you
to
witness
that
that
part
of
my
assertion
is
true
i
do
now
recollect
that
you
are
the
person
replied
he
and
you
may
recollect
the
observation
i
made
relative
to
your
hands
when
you
stated
that
you
were
a
poor
countryman
i
do
sir
perfectly
replied
i
perhaps
then
you
will
inform
us
by
what
means
a
and
twenty
pounds
in
money
came
into
your
possession
honestly
sir
replied
i
will
you
state
as
you
are
a
poor
countryman
with
whom
you
worked
last
what
parish
you
belong
to
and
whom
you
can
bring
forward
in
proof
of
good
character
i
certainly
shall
not
answer
those
questions
replied
i
if
i
chose
i
might
so
do
and
satisfactorily
what
is
your
name
i
can
not
answer
that
question
either
sir
replied
i
i
told
you
yesterday
that
we
had
met
before
was
it
not
at
bow
street
i
am
surprised
at
your
asking
a
question
sir
from
the
bench
to
which
if
i
answered
the
reply
might
affect
me
considerably
i
am
here
in
a
false
position
and
can
not
well
help
myself
i
have
no
friends
that
i
choose
to
call
for
i
should
blush
that
they
should
see
me
in
such
a
state
and
under
such
imputations
your
relations
young
man
would
certainly
not
be
backward
who
is
your
father
my
father
exclaimed
i
raising
up
my
hands
and
eyes
my
father
merciful
god
if
he
could
only
see
me
here
see
to
what
he
has
reduced
his
unhappy
son
and
i
covered
my
face
and
sobbed
convulsively
part
three
chapter
five
by
the
committing
of
magisterial
mistakes
i
am
personally
and
penally
committed
i
prepare
for
my
trial
by
calling
in
the
assistance
of
the
tailor
and
the
perfume
i
am
resolved
to
die
like
a
gentleman
it
is
indeed
a
pity
a
great
pity
observed
one
of
the
magistrates
such
a
fine
young
man
and
evidently
by
his
demeanour
and
language
well
brought
up
but
i
believe
said
he
turning
to
the
others
we
have
but
one
course
what
say
you
mr
norman
i
am
afraid
that
my
opinion
coincides
with
yours
and
that
the
grand
jury
will
not
hesitate
to
find
a
bill
as
the
case
stands
at
present
let
us
however
ask
the
witness
armstrong
one
question
do
you
positively
swear
to
this
young
man
being
one
of
the
persons
who
attacked
you
it
was
not
very
light
at
the
time
sir
and
both
the
men
had
their
faces
but
it
was
a
person
just
his
size
and
dressed
in
the
same
way
as
near
as
i
can
recollect
you
can
not
therefore
swear
to
his
identity
no
sir
but
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
he
is
the
man
take
that
evidence
down
as
important
said
mr
norman
it
will
assist
him
at
his
trial
the
evidence
was
taken
down
and
then
my
commitment
to
the
county
gaol
was
made
out
i
was
placed
in
a
cart
between
two
constables
and
driven
off
on
my
arrival
i
was
put
into
a
cell
and
my
money
returned
to
me
but
the
ring
was
detained
that
it
might
be
advertised
at
last
i
was
freed
from
the
manacles
and
when
the
prison
dress
was
brought
to
me
to
put
on
in
lieu
of
my
own
clothes
i
requested
leave
from
the
gaoler
to
wash
myself
which
was
granted
and
strange
to
say
so
unaccustomed
had
i
been
to
such
a
state
of
filth
that
i
felt
a
degree
of
happiness
as
i
returned
from
the
pump
in
the
and
i
put
on
the
prison
dress
almost
with
pleasure
for
degrading
as
it
was
at
all
events
it
was
new
and
clean
i
then
returned
to
my
cell
and
was
left
to
my
meditations
now
that
my
examination
and
committal
were
over
i
became
much
more
composed
and
was
able
to
reflect
coolly
i
perceived
the
great
danger
of
my
situation
how
strong
the
evidence
was
against
me
and
how
little
chance
i
had
of
escape
as
for
sending
to
lord
windermear
mr
masterton
or
those
who
formerly
were
acquainted
with
me
my
pride
forbade
it
i
would
sooner
have
perished
on
the
scaffold
besides
their
evidence
as
to
my
former
situation
in
life
although
it
would
perhaps
satisfactorily
account
for
my
possession
of
the
money
and
the
ring
and
for
my
disposing
of
my
portmanteau
all
strong
presumptive
evidence
against
me
would
not
destroy
the
evidence
brought
forward
as
to
the
robbery
which
appeared
to
be
so
very
conclusive
to
the
bench
of
magistrates
my
only
chance
appeared
to
be
in
the
footpad
who
had
not
escaped
acknowledging
that
i
was
not
his
accomplice
and
i
felt
how
much
i
was
interested
in
his
recovery
as
well
as
in
his
candour
the
assizes
i
knew
were
near
at
hand
and
i
anxiously
awaited
the
return
of
the
gaoler
to
make
a
few
inquiries
at
night
he
looked
through
the
small
square
cut
out
of
the
top
of
the
door
of
the
cell
for
it
was
his
duty
to
go
his
rounds
and
ascertain
if
all
his
prisoners
were
safe
i
then
asked
him
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
make
a
few
purchases
such
as
pens
ink
and
paper
etcetera
as
i
was
not
committed
to
prison
in
punishment
but
on
suspicion
this
was
not
denied
although
it
would
have
been
to
those
who
were
condemned
to
imprisonment
and
hard
labour
for
their
offences
and
he
volunteered
to
procure
them
for
me
the
next
morning
i
then
wished
him
a
good
night
and
threw
myself
on
my
mattress
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
distress
of
mind
i
slept
soundly
without
dreaming
until
daylight
the
next
morning
as
i
awoke
and
my
scattered
senses
were
returning
i
had
a
confused
idea
that
there
was
something
which
weighed
heavily
on
my
mind
which
sleep
had
banished
from
my
memory
what
is
it
thought
i
and
as
i
opened
my
eyes
so
did
i
remember
that
i
japhet
newland
who
but
two
nights
before
was
pressing
the
down
of
luxury
in
the
same
habitation
as
lady
de
clare
and
her
lovely
child
was
now
on
a
mattress
in
the
cell
of
a
prison
under
a
charge
which
threatened
me
with
an
ignominious
death
i
rose
and
sat
on
the
bed
for
i
had
not
thrown
off
my
clothes
my
first
thoughts
were
directed
to
timothy
should
i
write
to
him
no
no
why
should
i
make
him
miserable
if
i
was
to
suffer
it
should
be
under
an
assumed
name
but
what
name
here
i
was
interrupted
by
the
gaoler
who
opened
the
door
and
desired
me
to
roll
up
my
mattress
and
that
they
might
as
was
the
custom
be
taken
out
of
the
cell
during
the
day
my
first
inquiry
was
if
the
man
who
had
been
so
much
hurt
was
in
the
gaol
you
mean
your
replied
the
gaoler
yes
he
is
here
and
has
recovered
his
senses
the
doctor
says
he
will
do
very
well
has
he
made
any
confession
inquired
i
the
gaoler
made
no
reply
i
ask
that
question
continued
i
because
if
he
acknowledges
who
was
his
accomplice
i
shall
be
set
at
liberty
very
likely
replied
the
man
sarcastically
the
fact
is
there
is
no
occasion
for
king
evidence
in
this
case
or
you
might
get
off
by
crossing
the
water
so
you
must
trust
to
your
luck
the
grand
jury
meet
and
i
will
let
you
know
whether
a
true
bill
is
found
against
you
or
not
what
is
the
name
of
the
other
man
inquired
i
well
you
are
a
good
to
put
a
face
upon
a
matter
i
will
say
you
would
almost
persuade
me
with
that
innocent
look
of
yours
that
you
know
nothing
about
the
business
nor
do
i
replied
i
you
will
be
fortunate
if
you
can
prove
as
much
that
all
still
you
have
not
answered
my
question
what
is
the
other
name
well
replied
the
gaoler
laughing
since
you
are
determined
i
shall
tell
you
i
will
it
must
be
news
to
you
with
a
vengeance
his
name
is
bill
ogle
swamping
bill
i
suppose
you
never
heard
that
name
before
i
certainly
never
did
replied
i
perhaps
you
do
not
know
your
own
name
yet
i
can
tell
it
you
for
bill
ogle
has
blown
upon
you
so
far
indeed
replied
i
and
what
name
has
he
given
to
me
why
to
do
him
justice
it
was
until
he
saw
a
copy
of
the
depositions
before
the
magistrates
and
heard
how
you
were
nabbed
in
trying
to
help
him
off
that
he
did
tell
it
and
then
he
said
phill
maddox
always
was
a
true
and
i
mortal
sorry
that
he
in
by
looking
me
now
do
you
know
your
own
name
i
certainly
do
not
replied
i
well
did
you
ever
hear
of
one
who
went
by
the
name
of
phill
maddox
i
never
did
replied
i
and
i
am
glad
that
ogle
has
disclosed
so
much
well
i
never
before
met
with
a
man
who
did
know
his
own
name
or
had
the
face
to
say
so
and
expect
to
be
believed
but
never
mind
you
are
right
to
be
cautious
with
the
halter
looking
you
in
the
face
o
god
o
god
exclaimed
i
throwing
myself
on
the
bedstead
and
covering
up
my
face
give
me
strength
to
bear
even
that
if
so
it
must
be
the
gaoler
looked
at
me
for
a
time
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
him
he
puzzles
me
quite
certainly
yet
it
no
mistake
it
is
a
mistake
replied
i
rising
but
whether
the
mistake
will
be
found
out
until
too
late
is
another
point
however
it
is
of
little
consequence
what
have
i
to
live
for
unless
to
find
out
who
is
my
father
find
out
your
father
what
in
the
wind
now
well
it
beats
my
comprehension
altogether
but
did
not
you
say
you
wished
me
to
get
you
something
yes
replied
i
and
i
gave
him
some
money
with
directions
to
purchase
me
implements
for
writing
some
scented
wax
a
and
eau
de
cologne
and
comb
razors
small
and
various
implements
for
my
toilet
this
is
a
rum
world
said
the
man
repeating
what
i
asked
for
as
i
put
two
guineas
in
his
hand
i
purchased
many
an
article
for
a
prisoner
but
never
heard
of
such
rattletraps
afore
however
that
be
all
the
same
you
will
have
them
though
what
de
is
i
tell
nor
dang
me
if
i
shall
recollect
not
poison
be
it
for
that
is
not
allowed
in
the
prison
no
no
replied
i
indulging
in
momentary
mirth
at
the
idea
you
may
inquire
and
you
will
find
that
it
only
taken
by
ladies
who
are
troubled
with
the
vapours
now
i
should
ha
thought
that
you
have
spent
your
money
in
the
cookshop
which
is
so
much
more
natural
however
we
all
have
our
fancies
so
saying
he
flitted
the
cell
and
locked
the
door
part
three
chapter
six
i
am
condemned
to
be
hung
by
the
neck
until
i
am
dead
and
to
go
out
of
the
world
without
finding
out
who
is
my
father
afterwards
my
innocence
is
made
manifest
and
i
am
turned
adrift
a
maniac
in
the
high
road
it
may
appear
strange
to
the
reader
that
i
sent
for
the
articles
but
habit
is
second
nature
and
although
two
days
before
when
i
set
out
on
my
pilgrimage
i
had
resolved
to
discard
these
superfluities
yet
now
in
my
distress
i
felt
as
if
they
would
comfort
me
that
evening
after
rectifying
a
few
mistakes
on
the
part
of
the
gaoler
by
writing
down
what
i
wanted
on
the
paper
which
he
had
procured
me
i
obtained
all
that
i
required
the
next
morning
he
informed
me
that
the
grand
jury
had
found
a
true
bill
against
me
and
that
on
the
saturday
next
the
assizes
would
be
held
he
also
brought
me
the
list
of
trials
and
i
found
that
mine
would
be
one
of
the
last
and
would
not
probably
come
on
until
monday
or
tuesday
i
requested
him
to
send
for
a
good
tailor
as
i
wished
to
be
dressed
in
a
proper
manner
previous
to
appearing
in
court
as
a
prisoner
is
allowed
to
go
into
court
in
his
own
clothes
instead
of
the
gaol
dress
this
was
consented
to
and
when
the
man
came
i
was
very
particular
in
my
directions
so
much
so
that
it
surprised
him
he
also
procured
me
the
other
articles
i
required
to
complete
my
dress
and
on
saturday
night
i
had
them
all
ready
for
i
was
resolved
that
i
would
at
least
die
as
a
gentleman
sunday
passed
away
not
as
it
ought
to
have
passed
certainly
i
attended
prayers
but
my
thoughts
were
elsewhere
how
indeed
could
it
be
otherwise
who
can
control
his
thoughts
he
may
attempt
so
to
do
but
the
attempt
is
all
that
can
be
made
he
can
not
command
them
i
heard
nothing
my
mind
was
in
a
state
of
gyration
whirling
round
from
one
thing
to
the
other
until
i
was
giddy
from
intensity
of
feeling
on
monday
morning
the
gaoler
came
and
asked
me
whether
i
would
have
legal
advice
i
replied
in
the
negative
you
will
be
called
about
twelve
i
hear
continued
he
it
is
now
ten
and
there
is
only
one
more
trial
before
yours
about
the
stealing
of
four
geese
and
half
a
dozen
fowls
good
god
thought
i
and
am
i
mixed
up
with
such
deeds
as
these
i
dressed
myself
with
the
utmost
care
and
precision
and
never
was
more
successful
my
clothes
were
black
and
fitted
well
about
one
i
was
summoned
by
the
gaoler
and
led
between
him
and
another
to
the
and
placed
in
the
dock
at
first
my
eyes
swam
and
i
could
distinguish
nothing
but
gradually
i
recovered
i
looked
round
for
i
had
called
up
my
courage
my
eyes
wandered
from
the
judge
to
the
row
of
legal
gentlemen
below
him
from
them
to
the
ladies
who
sat
in
the
gallery
above
behind
me
i
did
not
look
i
had
seen
enough
and
my
cheeks
burnt
with
shame
at
last
i
looked
at
my
who
stood
beside
me
and
his
eyes
at
the
same
time
met
mine
he
was
dressed
in
the
gaol
clothes
of
pepper
and
salt
coarse
cloth
he
was
a
rough
vulgar
man
but
his
eye
was
brilliant
his
complexion
was
dark
and
his
face
was
covered
with
whiskers
good
heavens
thought
i
who
will
ever
imagine
or
credit
that
we
have
been
associates
the
man
stared
at
me
bit
his
lip
and
smiled
with
contempt
but
made
no
further
remark
the
indictment
having
been
read
the
clerk
of
the
court
cried
out
you
benjamin
ogle
having
heard
the
charge
say
guilty
or
not
guilty
not
guilty
replied
the
man
to
my
astonishment
you
philip
maddox
guilty
or
not
guilty
i
did
not
answer
prisoner
observed
the
judge
in
a
mild
voice
you
must
answer
guilty
or
not
guilty
it
is
merely
a
form
my
lord
replied
i
my
name
is
not
philip
maddox
that
is
the
name
given
in
the
indictment
by
the
evidence
of
your
observed
the
judge
your
real
name
we
can
not
pretend
to
know
it
is
sufficient
that
you
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
you
the
prisoner
are
guilty
or
not
guilty
not
guilty
my
lord
most
certainly
replied
i
placing
my
hand
to
my
heart
and
bowing
to
him
the
trial
proceeded
armstrong
was
the
principal
evidence
to
my
person
he
would
not
swear
the
jew
proved
my
selling
my
clothes
purchasing
those
found
in
the
bundle
and
the
stick
of
which
armstrong
possessed
himself
the
clothes
i
had
on
at
the
time
of
my
capture
were
produced
in
court
as
for
ogle
his
case
was
decisive
we
were
then
called
upon
for
our
defence
ogle
was
very
short
he
had
been
accustomed
to
fits
all
his
life
was
walking
to
hounslow
and
had
fallen
down
in
a
fit
it
must
have
been
somebody
else
who
had
committed
the
robbery
and
had
made
off
and
he
had
been
picked
up
in
a
mistake
this
defence
appeared
to
make
no
other
impression
than
ridicule
and
indignation
at
the
barefaced
assertion
i
was
then
called
on
for
mine
my
lord
said
i
i
have
no
defence
to
make
except
that
which
i
asserted
before
the
magistrates
that
i
was
performing
an
act
of
charity
towards
a
and
was
through
that
supposed
to
be
an
accomplice
arraigned
before
so
many
upon
a
charge
at
the
bare
accusation
of
which
my
blood
revolts
i
can
not
and
will
not
allow
those
who
might
prove
what
my
life
has
been
and
the
circumstances
which
induced
me
to
take
up
the
disguise
in
which
i
was
taken
to
appear
in
my
behalf
i
am
unfortunate
but
not
guilty
one
only
chance
appears
to
be
open
to
me
which
is
in
the
candour
of
the
party
who
now
stands
by
me
if
he
will
say
to
the
court
that
he
ever
saw
me
before
i
will
submit
without
murmur
to
my
sentence
i
sorry
that
you
put
that
question
my
boy
replied
the
man
for
i
have
seen
you
before
and
the
wretch
chuckled
with
repressed
laughter
i
was
so
astonished
so
thunderstruck
with
this
assertion
that
i
held
down
my
head
and
made
no
reply
the
judge
then
summed
up
the
evidence
to
the
jury
pointing
out
to
them
that
of
ogle
guilt
there
could
be
no
doubt
and
of
mine
he
was
sorry
to
say
but
little
still
they
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
witness
armstrong
could
not
swear
to
my
person
the
jury
without
leaving
the
box
consulted
together
a
short
time
and
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
against
benjamin
ogle
and
philip
maddox
i
heard
no
more
the
judge
sentenced
us
both
to
execution
he
lamented
that
so
young
and
prepossessing
a
person
as
myself
should
be
about
to
suffer
for
such
an
offence
he
pointed
out
the
necessity
of
condign
punishment
and
gave
us
no
hopes
of
pardon
or
clemency
but
i
heard
him
not
i
did
not
fall
but
i
was
in
a
state
of
stupor
at
last
he
wound
up
his
sentence
by
praying
us
to
prepare
ourselves
for
the
awful
change
by
an
appeal
to
that
heavenly
father
father
exclaimed
i
in
a
voice
which
electrified
the
court
did
you
say
my
father
o
god
where
is
he
and
i
fell
down
in
a
fit
the
handkerchiefs
of
the
ladies
were
applied
to
their
faces
the
whole
court
were
moved
for
i
had
by
my
appearance
excited
considerable
interest
and
the
judge
with
a
faltering
subdued
voice
desired
that
the
prisoners
might
be
removed
stop
one
minute
my
good
fellow
said
ogle
to
the
gaoler
while
others
were
taking
me
out
of
court
my
lord
i
something
rather
important
to
say
why
i
did
not
say
it
before
you
shall
hear
you
are
a
judge
to
condemn
the
guilty
and
release
the
innocent
we
are
told
that
there
is
no
trial
like
an
english
jury
but
this
i
say
that
many
a
man
is
hung
for
what
he
never
has
been
guilty
of
you
have
condemned
that
poor
young
man
to
death
i
could
have
prevented
it
if
i
had
chosen
to
speak
before
but
i
would
not
that
i
might
prove
how
little
there
is
of
justice
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
robbery
phill
maddox
was
the
man
and
he
is
not
philip
maddox
he
said
that
he
never
saw
me
before
nor
do
i
believe
that
he
ever
did
as
sure
as
i
shall
hang
he
is
innocent
it
was
but
now
that
when
appealed
to
by
him
you
stated
that
you
had
seen
him
before
so
i
did
and
i
told
the
truth
i
had
seen
him
before
i
saw
him
go
to
hold
the
gentleman
horse
but
he
did
not
see
me
i
stole
his
bundle
and
his
stick
which
he
left
on
the
bench
and
that
how
they
were
found
in
our
possession
now
you
have
the
truth
and
you
may
either
acknowledge
that
there
is
little
justice
by
eating
your
own
words
and
letting
him
free
or
you
may
hang
him
rather
than
acknowledge
that
you
are
wrong
at
all
events
his
blood
will
now
be
on
your
hands
and
not
mine
if
phill
maddox
had
not
turned
tail
like
a
coward
i
should
not
have
been
here
so
i
tell
the
truth
to
save
him
who
was
doing
me
a
kind
act
and
to
let
him
swing
who
left
me
in
the
lurch
the
judge
desired
that
this
statement
might
be
taken
down
that
further
inquiry
might
be
made
intimating
to
the
jury
that
i
should
be
respited
for
the
present
but
of
all
this
i
was
ignorant
as
there
was
no
placing
confidence
in
the
assertions
of
such
a
man
as
ogle
it
was
considered
necessary
that
he
should
repeat
his
assertions
at
the
last
hour
of
his
existence
and
the
gaoler
was
ordered
not
to
state
what
had
passed
to
me
as
he
might
excite
false
hopes
when
i
recovered
from
my
fit
i
found
myself
in
the
gaoler
parlour
and
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
walk
i
was
locked
up
in
a
condemned
cell
the
execution
had
been
ordered
to
take
place
on
the
thursday
and
i
had
two
days
to
prepare
in
the
mean
time
the
greatest
interest
had
been
excited
with
regard
to
me
my
whole
appearance
so
evidently
belied
the
charge
that
everyone
was
in
my
favour
ogle
was
and
immediately
gave
a
clue
for
the
apprehension
of
maddox
who
he
said
he
hoped
would
swing
by
his
side
the
gaoler
came
to
me
the
next
day
saying
that
some
of
the
magistrates
wished
to
speak
with
me
but
as
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
reveal
my
former
life
my
only
reply
was
that
i
begged
they
would
allow
me
to
have
my
last
moments
to
myself
i
recollected
melchior
idea
of
destiny
and
imagined
that
he
was
right
it
was
my
destiny
thought
i
and
i
remained
in
a
state
of
stupor
the
fact
was
that
i
was
very
ill
my
head
was
heavy
my
brain
was
on
fire
and
the
throbbing
of
my
heart
could
have
been
perceived
without
touching
my
breast
i
remained
on
the
mattress
all
day
and
all
the
next
night
with
my
face
buried
in
the
clothes
i
was
too
ill
to
raise
my
head
on
wednesday
morning
i
felt
myself
gently
pushed
on
the
shoulder
by
someone
i
opened
my
eyes
it
was
a
clergyman
i
turned
away
my
head
and
remained
as
before
i
was
then
in
a
violent
fever
he
spoke
for
some
time
occasionally
i
heard
a
word
and
then
relapsed
into
a
state
of
mental
imbecility
he
sighed
and
went
away
thursday
came
and
the
hour
of
death
but
time
was
by
me
unheeded
as
well
as
eternity
in
the
mean
time
maddox
had
been
taken
and
the
contents
of
armstrong
bundle
found
in
his
possession
and
when
he
discovered
that
ogle
had
been
evidence
against
him
he
confessed
to
the
robbery
whether
it
was
on
thursday
or
friday
i
knew
not
then
but
i
was
lifted
off
the
bed
and
taken
before
somebody
something
passed
but
the
fever
had
mounted
up
to
my
head
and
i
was
in
a
state
of
stupid
delirium
strange
to
say
they
did
not
perceive
my
condition
but
ascribed
it
all
to
abject
fear
of
death
i
was
led
away
i
had
made
no
answer
but
i
was
free
part
three
chapter
seven
when
at
the
lowest
spoke
of
fortune
wheel
one
is
sure
to
rise
as
it
turns
round
i
recover
my
senses
and
find
myself
amongst
friends
i
think
some
people
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
others
shouted
as
i
walked
in
the
open
air
but
i
recollect
no
more
i
afterwards
was
informed
that
i
had
been
reprieved
that
i
had
been
sent
for
and
a
long
exhortation
delivered
to
me
for
it
was
considered
that
my
life
must
have
been
one
of
error
or
i
should
have
applied
to
my
friends
and
have
given
my
name
my
not
answering
was
attributed
to
shame
and
confusion
my
glassy
eye
had
not
been
noticed
my
tottering
step
when
led
in
by
the
gaolers
attributed
to
other
causes
and
the
magistrates
shook
their
heads
as
i
was
led
out
of
their
presence
the
gaoler
had
asked
me
several
times
where
i
intended
to
go
at
last
i
had
told
him
seek
my
and
darting
away
from
him
i
had
run
like
a
madman
down
the
street
of
course
he
had
no
longer
any
power
over
me
but
he
muttered
as
i
fled
from
him
i
a
notion
he
soon
be
locked
up
again
poor
fellow
it
turned
his
brain
for
certain
as
i
tottered
along
my
unsteady
step
naturally
attracted
the
attention
of
the
but
they
attributed
it
to
intoxication
thus
was
i
allowed
to
wander
away
in
a
state
of
madness
and
before
night
i
was
far
from
the
town
what
passed
and
whither
i
had
bent
my
steps
i
can
not
tell
all
i
know
is
that
after
running
like
a
maniac
seizing
everybody
by
the
arm
that
i
met
staring
at
them
with
wild
and
flashing
eyes
and
sometimes
in
a
solemn
voice
at
others
in
a
loud
threatening
tone
startling
them
with
the
interrogatory
are
you
my
father
and
then
darting
away
or
sobbing
like
a
child
as
the
humour
took
me
i
had
crossed
the
country
and
three
days
afterwards
i
was
picked
up
at
the
door
of
a
house
in
the
town
of
reading
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
exposure
and
nearly
dead
when
i
recovered
i
found
myself
in
bed
my
head
shaved
my
arm
bound
up
after
repeated
bleedings
and
a
female
figure
sitting
by
me
god
in
heaven
where
am
i
exclaimed
i
faintly
thou
hast
called
often
upon
thy
earthly
father
during
the
time
of
thy
illness
friend
replied
a
soft
voice
it
rejoiceth
me
much
to
hear
thee
call
upon
thy
father
which
is
in
heaven
be
comforted
thou
art
in
the
hands
of
those
who
will
be
mindful
of
thee
offer
up
thy
thanks
in
one
short
prayer
for
thy
return
to
reason
and
then
sink
again
into
repose
for
thou
must
need
it
much
i
opened
my
eyes
wide
and
perceived
that
a
young
person
in
a
dress
was
sitting
by
the
bed
working
with
her
needle
an
open
bible
was
on
a
little
table
before
her
i
perceived
also
a
cup
and
parched
with
thirst
i
merely
said
give
me
to
drink
she
arose
and
put
a
teaspoon
to
my
lips
but
i
raised
my
hand
took
the
cup
from
her
and
emptied
it
o
how
delightful
was
that
draught
i
sank
down
on
my
pillow
for
even
that
slight
exertion
had
overpowered
me
and
muttering
god
i
thank
thee
i
was
immediately
in
a
sound
sleep
from
which
i
did
not
awake
for
many
hours
when
i
did
it
was
not
daylight
a
lamp
was
on
the
table
and
an
old
man
in
a
quaker
dress
was
snoring
very
comfortably
in
the
i
felt
quite
refreshed
with
my
long
sleep
and
was
now
able
to
recall
what
had
passed
i
remembered
the
condemned
cell
and
the
mattress
upon
which
i
lay
but
all
after
was
in
a
state
of
confusion
here
and
there
a
fact
or
supposition
was
strong
in
my
memory
but
the
intervals
between
were
total
blanks
i
was
at
all
events
free
that
i
felt
convinced
of
and
that
i
was
in
the
hands
of
the
sect
who
denominate
themselves
quakers
but
where
was
i
and
how
did
i
come
here
i
remained
thinking
on
the
past
and
wondering
until
the
day
broke
and
with
the
daylight
roused
up
my
watchful
attendant
he
yawned
stretched
his
arms
and
rising
from
the
chair
came
to
the
side
of
my
bed
i
looked
him
in
the
face
hast
thou
slept
well
friend
said
he
i
have
slept
as
much
as
i
wish
and
would
not
disturb
you
replied
i
for
i
wanted
nothing
peradventure
i
did
sleep
replied
the
man
watching
long
agreeth
not
with
the
flesh
although
the
spirit
is
most
willing
requirest
thou
anything
yes
replied
i
i
wish
to
know
where
i
am
verily
thou
art
in
the
town
of
reading
in
berkshire
and
in
the
house
of
pheneas
cophagus
cophagus
exclaimed
i
mr
cophagus
the
surgeon
and
apothecary
pheneas
cophagus
is
his
name
he
hath
been
admitted
into
our
sect
and
hath
married
a
daughter
of
our
persuasion
he
hath
attended
thee
in
thy
fever
and
thy
frenzy
without
calling
in
the
aid
of
the
physician
therefore
do
i
believe
that
he
must
be
the
man
of
whom
thou
speakest
yet
doth
he
not
follow
up
the
healing
art
for
the
lucre
of
gain
and
the
young
person
who
was
at
my
bedside
is
she
his
wife
nay
friend
she
is
to
the
wife
of
pheneas
cophagus
by
a
second
marriage
and
a
maiden
who
was
named
susannah
temple
at
the
baptismal
font
but
i
will
go
to
pheneas
cophagus
and
acquaint
him
of
your
waking
for
such
were
his
directions
the
man
then
quitted
the
room
leaving
me
quite
astonished
with
the
information
he
had
imparted
cophagus
turned
quaker
and
attending
me
in
the
town
of
reading
in
a
short
time
mr
cophagus
himself
entered
in
his
japhet
said
he
seizing
my
hand
with
eagerness
and
then
as
if
recollecting
he
checked
himself
and
commenced
in
a
slow
tone
japhet
newland
truly
glad
am
i
hum
verily
do
i
rejoice
you
ephraim
get
out
of
the
room
and
so
on
yea
i
will
depart
since
it
is
thy
bidding
replied
the
man
quitting
the
room
mr
cophagus
then
greeted
me
in
his
usual
way
told
me
that
he
had
found
me
insensible
at
the
door
of
a
house
a
little
way
off
and
had
immediately
recognised
me
he
had
brought
me
to
his
own
home
but
without
much
hope
of
my
recovery
he
then
begged
to
know
by
what
strange
chance
i
had
been
found
in
such
a
desolate
condition
i
replied
that
although
i
was
able
to
listen
i
did
not
feel
myself
equal
to
the
exertion
of
telling
so
long
a
story
and
that
i
should
infinitely
prefer
that
he
should
narrate
to
me
what
had
passed
since
we
had
parted
at
dublin
and
how
it
was
that
i
now
found
that
he
had
joined
the
sect
of
quakers
peradventure
long
word
that
um
queer
people
very
good
and
so
on
commenced
mr
cophagus
but
as
the
reader
will
not
understand
his
phraseology
quite
so
well
as
i
did
i
shall
give
mr
cophagus
history
in
my
own
version
mr
cophagus
had
returned
to
the
small
town
at
which
he
resided
and
on
his
arrival
he
had
been
called
upon
by
a
gentleman
who
was
of
the
society
of
friends
requesting
that
he
would
prescribe
for
a
niece
of
his
who
was
on
a
visit
at
his
house
and
had
been
taken
dangerously
cophagus
with
his
usual
kindness
of
heart
immediately
consented
and
found
that
mr
temple
report
was
true
for
six
weeks
he
attended
the
young
quakeress
and
recovered
her
from
an
imminent
and
painful
disease
in
which
she
showed
such
fortitude
and
resignation
and
such
unconquerable
good
temper
that
when
mr
cophagus
returned
to
his
bachelor
establishment
he
could
not
help
reflecting
upon
what
an
invaluable
wife
she
would
make
and
how
much
more
cheerful
his
house
would
be
with
such
a
domestic
partner
in
short
mr
cophagus
fell
in
love
and
like
all
elderly
gentlemen
who
have
so
long
bottled
up
their
affections
he
became
most
desperately
enamoured
and
if
he
loved
miss
judith
temple
when
he
witnessed
her
patience
and
resignation
under
suffering
how
much
more
did
he
love
her
when
he
found
that
she
was
playful
merry
and
cheerful
without
being
boisterous
when
restored
to
her
health
mr
cophagus
attentions
could
not
be
misunderstood
he
told
her
uncle
that
he
had
thought
seriously
of
wedding
cake
white
favours
marriage
family
and
so
on
and
to
the
young
lady
he
had
put
his
cane
up
to
his
nose
and
prescribed
a
dose
of
matrimony
to
be
taken
immediately
to
mr
cophagus
there
was
no
objection
raised
by
the
lady
who
was
not
in
her
teens
or
by
the
uncle
who
had
always
respected
him
as
a
worthy
man
and
a
good
christian
but
to
marry
one
who
was
not
of
her
persuasion
was
not
to
be
thought
of
her
friends
would
not
consent
to
it
mr
cophagus
was
therefore
dismissed
with
a
full
assurance
that
the
only
objection
which
offered
was
that
he
was
not
of
their
society
mr
cophagus
walked
home
discomforted
he
sat
down
on
his
easy
chair
and
found
it
excessively
uneasy
he
sat
down
to
his
solitary
meal
and
found
that
his
own
company
was
unbearable
he
went
to
bed
but
found
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
to
sleep
the
next
morning
therefore
mr
cophagus
returned
to
mr
temple
and
stated
his
wish
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
difference
between
the
tenets
of
the
quaker
persuasion
and
those
of
the
established
church
mr
temple
gave
him
an
outline
which
appeared
to
mr
cophagus
to
be
very
satisfactory
and
then
referred
him
to
his
niece
for
fuller
particulars
when
a
man
enters
into
an
argument
with
a
full
desire
to
be
convinced
and
with
his
future
happiness
perhaps
depending
upon
that
conviction
and
when
further
those
arguments
are
brought
forward
by
one
of
the
prettiest
voices
and
backed
by
the
sweetest
of
smiles
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
his
soon
becoming
a
proselyte
thus
it
was
with
mr
cophagus
who
in
a
week
discovered
that
the
peace
humility
and
upon
which
the
quaker
tenets
are
founded
were
much
more
congenial
to
the
true
spirit
of
the
christian
revelation
than
the
athanasian
creed
to
be
sung
or
said
in
our
established
churches
and
with
this
conviction
mr
cophagus
requested
admission
into
the
fraternity
and
shortly
after
his
admission
it
was
thought
advisable
by
the
friends
that
his
faith
should
be
confirmed
and
strengthened
by
his
espousal
of
miss
judith
temple
with
whom
at
her
request
and
he
could
refuse
her
nothing
he
had
repaired
to
the
town
of
reading
in
which
her
relations
all
resided
and
pheneas
cophagus
of
the
society
of
friends
declared
himself
to
be
as
happy
as
a
man
could
be
good
people
japhet
um
honest
people
japhet
do
fight
little
stiff
spirit
moves
and
so
on
said
mr
cophagus
as
he
concluded
his
narrative
and
then
shaking
me
by
the
hand
retired
to
shave
and
dress
part

chapter
eight
i
fall
in
love
with
religion
when
preached
by
one
who
has
the
form
of
an
angel
in
half
an
hour
afterwards
ephraim
came
in
with
a
draught
which
i
was
desired
to
take
by
mr
cophagus
and
then
to
try
and
sleep
this
was
good
advice
and
i
followed
it
i
awoke
after
a
long
refreshing
sleep
and
found
mr
and
mrs
cophagus
sitting
in
the
room
she
at
work
and
he
occupied
with
a
book
when
i
opened
my
eyes
and
perceived
a
female
i
looked
to
ascertain
if
it
was
the
young
person
whom
ephraim
had
stated
to
be
susannah
temple
not
that
i
recollected
her
features
exactly
but
i
did
the
contour
of
her
person
mrs
cophagus
was
taller
and
i
had
a
fair
scrutiny
of
her
before
they
perceived
that
i
was
awake
her
face
was
very
pleasing
features
small
and
regular
she
appeared
to
be
about
thirty
years
of
age
and
was
studiously
neat
and
clean
in
her
person
her
quaker
dress
was
not
without
some
little
departure
from
the
strict
fashion
and
form
sufficient
to
assist
without
deviating
from
its
simplicity
if
i
might
use
the
term
it
was
a
little
coquettish
and
evinced
that
the
wearer
had
she
not
belonged
to
that
sect
would
have
shown
great
taste
in
the
adornment
of
her
person
mr
cophagus
although
he
did
not
think
so
himself
as
i
afterwards
found
out
was
certainly
much
improved
by
his
change
of
costume
his
spindle
shanks
which
as
i
have
before
observed
were
peculiarly
at
variance
with
his
little
orbicular
stomach
were
now
concealed
in
loose
trowsers
which
took
off
from
the
protuberance
of
the
latter
and
added
dignity
to
the
former
blending
the
two
together
so
that
his
roundness
became
fine
by
degrees
and
beautifully
less
as
it
descended
altogether
the
quaker
dress
added
very
much
to
the
substantiability
of
his
appearance
and
was
a
manifest
improvement
especially
when
he
wore
his
hat
having
satisfied
my
curiosity
i
moved
the
curtain
so
as
to
attract
their
attention
and
cophagus
came
to
my
bedside
and
felt
my
pulse
good
very
good
all
right
little
broth
throw
in
bark
on
his
legs
well
as
ever
and
so
on
i
am
indeed
much
better
this
afternoon
replied
i
indeed
so
well
that
i
feel
as
if
i
could
get
up
pooh
tumble
down
never
do
lie
a
bed
get
strong
wife
mrs
cophagus
japhet
old
friend
mrs
cophagus
had
risen
from
her
chair
and
come
towards
the
bed
when
her
husband
introduced
her
in
his
own
fashion
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
been
a
great
trouble
madam
said
i
japhet
newland
we
have
done
but
our
duty
even
if
thou
wert
not
as
it
appears
that
thou
art
a
friend
of
my
husband
consider
me
therefore
as
thy
sister
and
i
will
regard
thee
as
a
brother
and
if
thou
wouldst
wish
it
thou
shalt
sojourn
with
us
for
so
hath
my
husband
communicated
his
wishes
unto
me
i
thanked
her
for
her
kind
expressions
and
took
the
fair
hand
which
was
offered
in
such
amity
cophagus
then
asked
me
if
i
was
well
enough
to
inform
him
of
what
had
passed
since
our
last
meeting
and
telling
me
that
his
wife
knew
my
whole
history
and
that
i
might
speak
before
her
he
took
his
seat
by
the
side
of
the
bed
his
wife
also
drew
her
chair
nearer
and
i
commenced
the
narrative
of
what
had
passed
since
we
parted
in
ireland
when
i
had
finished
mr
cophagus
commenced
as
usual
um
very
odd
lose
money
bad
grow
honest
good
run
away
from
friends
bad
not
hung
good
brain
fever
bad
come
here
good
stay
with
us
quite
comfortable
and
so
on
thou
hast
suffered
much
friend
japhet
said
mrs
cophagus
wiping
her
eyes
and
i
would
almost
venture
to
say
hast
been
chastised
too
severely
were
it
not
that
those
whom
he
loveth
he
chastiseth
still
thou
art
saved
and
now
out
of
danger
peradventure
thou
wilt
now
quit
a
vain
world
and
be
content
to
live
with
us
nay
as
thou
hast
the
example
of
thy
former
master
it
may
perhaps
please
the
lord
to
advise
thee
to
become
one
of
us
and
to
join
us
as
a
friend
my
husband
was
persuaded
to
the
right
path
by
me
continued
she
looking
fondly
at
him
who
knoweth
but
some
of
our
maidens
may
also
persuade
thee
to
eschew
a
vain
unrighteous
world
and
follow
thy
redeemer
in
humility
very
true
um
very
true
observed
cophagus
putting
more
quakerism
than
usual
in
his
style
and
drawing
out
his
ums
to
treble
their
usual
length
happy
life
japhet
um
all
at
peace
quiet
amusements
think
about
it
um
no
hurry
never
swear
hell
spirit
may
move
um
not
now
talk
about
it
get
well
set
up
shop
and
so
on
i
was
tired
with
talking
so
much
and
having
taken
some
nourishment
again
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
in
the
evening
friend
cophagus
and
his
wife
were
not
in
the
room
but
susannah
temple
whom
i
had
first
seen
and
of
whom
i
had
made
inquiry
of
ephraim
who
was
cophagus
servant
she
was
sitting
close
to
the
light
and
reading
and
long
did
i
continue
to
gaze
upon
her
fearful
of
interrupting
her
she
was
the
most
beautiful
specimen
of
clear
and
transparent
white
that
i
ever
had
beheld
her
complexion
was
unrivalled
her
eyes
were
large
but
i
could
not
ascertain
their
colour
as
they
were
cast
down
upon
her
book
and
hid
by
her
long
fringed
eyelashes
her
eyebrows
arched
and
regular
as
if
drawn
by
a
pair
of
compasses
and
their
soft
hair
in
beautiful
contrast
with
her
snowy
forehead
her
hair
was
auburn
but
mostly
concealed
within
her
cap
her
nose
was
very
straight
but
not
very
large
and
her
mouth
was
perfection
she
appeared
to
be
between
seventeen
and
eighteen
years
old
as
far
as
i
could
ascertain
her
figure
was
symmetrically
perfect
dressed
as
she
was
in
the
modest
simple
garb
worn
by
the
females
of
the
society
of
friends
she
gave
an
idea
of
neatness
cleanliness
and
propriety
upon
which
i
could
have
gazed
for
ever
she
was
indeed
most
beautiful
i
felt
her
beauty
her
purity
and
i
could
have
worshipped
her
as
an
angel
while
i
still
had
my
eyes
fixed
upon
her
exquisite
features
she
closed
her
book
and
rising
from
her
chair
came
to
the
side
of
the
bed
that
she
might
not
be
startled
at
the
idea
of
my
having
been
watching
her
i
closed
my
eyes
and
pretended
to
slumber
she
resumed
her
seat
and
then
i
changed
my
position
and
spoke
is
anyone
there
yes
friend
newland
what
is
it
that
thou
requirest
said
she
advancing
wouldst
thou
see
cophagus
or
ephraim
i
will
summon
them
o
no
replied
i
why
should
i
disturb
them
from
their
amusements
or
employments
i
have
slept
a
long
while
and
i
would
like
to
read
a
little
i
think
if
my
eyes
are
not
too
weak
thou
must
not
read
but
i
may
read
unto
thee
replied
susannah
tell
me
what
is
it
that
thou
wouldest
have
me
read
i
have
no
vain
books
but
surely
thou
thinkest
not
of
them
after
thy
escape
from
death
i
care
not
what
is
read
provided
that
you
read
to
me
replied
i
nay
but
thou
shouldest
care
and
be
not
wroth
if
i
say
to
thee
that
there
is
but
one
book
to
which
thou
shouldest
now
listen
thou
hast
been
saved
from
deadly
peril
thou
hast
been
rescued
from
the
jaws
of
death
art
thou
not
thankful
and
to
whom
is
gratitude
most
due
but
to
thy
heavenly
father
who
hath
been
pleased
to
spare
thee
you
are
right
replied
i
then
i
pray
you
to
read
to
me
from
the
bible
susannah
made
no
reply
but
resumed
her
seat
and
selecting
those
chapters
most
appropriate
to
my
situation
read
them
in
a
beautiful
and
impressive
tone
part
three
chapter
nine
pride
and
love
at
issue
the
latter
is
victorious
i
turn
quaker
and
recommence
my
old
profession
if
the
reader
will
recall
my
narrative
to
his
recollection
he
must
observe
that
religion
had
had
hitherto
but
little
of
my
thoughts
i
had
lived
the
life
of
most
who
live
in
this
world
perhaps
not
quite
so
correct
in
morals
as
many
people
for
my
code
of
morality
was
suited
to
circumstances
as
to
religion
i
had
none
i
had
lived
in
the
world
and
for
the
world
i
had
certainly
been
well
instructed
in
the
tenets
of
our
faith
when
i
was
at
the
asylum
but
there
as
in
most
other
schools
it
is
made
irksome
as
a
task
and
is
looked
upon
with
almost
a
feeling
of
aversion
no
proper
religious
sentiments
are
or
can
be
inculcated
to
a
large
number
of
scholars
it
is
the
parent
alone
who
can
instil
by
precept
and
example
that
true
sense
of
religion
which
may
serve
as
a
guide
through
life
i
had
not
read
the
bible
from
the
time
that
i
quitted
the
foundling
hospital
it
was
new
to
me
and
when
i
now
heard
read
by
that
beautiful
creature
passages
equally
beautiful
and
so
applicable
to
my
situation
weakened
by
disease
and
humbled
in
adversity
i
was
moved
even
unto
tears
susannah
closed
the
book
and
came
to
the
bedside
i
thanked
her
she
perceived
my
emotion
and
when
i
held
out
my
hand
she
did
not
refuse
hers
i
kissed
it
and
it
was
immediately
withdrawn
and
she
left
the
room
shortly
afterwards
ephraim
made
his
appearance
cophagus
and
his
wife
also
came
that
evening
but
i
saw
no
more
of
susannah
temple
until
the
following
day
when
i
again
requested
her
to
read
to
me
i
will
not
detain
the
reader
by
an
account
of
my
recovery
in
three
weeks
i
was
able
to
leave
the
room
during
that
time
i
had
become
very
intimate
with
the
whole
family
and
was
treated
as
if
i
belonged
to
it
during
my
illness
i
had
certainly
shown
more
sense
of
religion
than
i
had
ever
done
before
but
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
i
was
really
religious
i
liked
to
hear
the
bible
read
by
susannah
and
i
liked
to
talk
with
her
upon
religious
subjects
but
had
susannah
been
an
ugly
old
woman
i
very
much
doubt
if
i
should
have
been
so
attentive
it
was
her
extreme
beauty
her
modesty
and
fervour
which
so
became
her
which
enchanted
me
i
felt
the
beauty
of
religion
but
it
was
through
an
earthly
object
it
was
beautiful
in
her
she
looked
an
angel
and
i
listened
to
her
precepts
as
delivered
by
one
still
whatever
may
be
the
cause
by
which
a
person
attention
can
be
directed
to
so
important
a
subject
so
generally
neglected
whether
by
fear
of
death
or
by
love
towards
an
earthly
object
the
advantages
are
the
same
and
although
very
far
from
what
i
ought
to
have
been
i
certainly
was
through
my
admiration
of
her
a
better
man
as
soon
as
i
was
on
the
sofa
wrapped
up
in
one
of
the
of
mr
cophagus
he
told
me
that
the
clothes
in
which
i
had
been
picked
up
were
all
in
tatters
and
asked
me
whether
i
would
like
to
have
others
made
according
to
the
usual
fashion
or
like
those
with
whom
i
should
he
trusted
in
future
reside
i
had
already
debated
this
matter
in
my
mind
return
to
the
world
i
had
resolved
not
to
do
to
follow
up
the
object
of
my
search
appeared
to
me
only
to
involve
me
in
difficulties
and
what
were
the
intentions
of
cophagus
with
regard
to
me
i
knew
not
i
was
hesitating
for
i
knew
not
what
answer
to
give
when
i
perceived
the
pensive
eye
of
susannah
fixed
upon
me
watching
attentively
if
not
eagerly
for
my
response
it
decided
the
point
if
replied
i
you
do
not
think
that
i
should
disgrace
you
i
should
wish
to
wear
the
dress
of
the
society
of
friends
although
not
yet
one
of
your
body
but
soon
to
be
i
trust
replied
mrs
cophagus
alas
replied
i
i
am
an
outcast
and
i
looked
at
susannah
temple
not
so
japhet
newland
replied
she
mildly
i
am
pleased
that
thou
hast
of
thy
own
accord
rejected
vain
attire
i
trust
that
thou
wilt
not
find
that
thou
art
without
friends
while
i
am
with
you
replied
i
addressing
myself
to
them
all
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
conform
to
your
manners
in
every
way
but
when
i
resume
my
search
and
why
shouldst
thou
resume
a
search
which
must
prove
unavailing
and
but
leads
thee
into
error
and
misfortune
i
am
but
young
japhet
newland
and
not
perhaps
so
able
to
advise
yet
doth
it
appear
to
me
that
the
search
can
only
be
availing
when
made
by
those
who
left
thee
when
they
wish
for
you
they
will
seek
thee
but
thy
seeking
them
is
vain
and
fruitless
but
replied
i
recollect
that
inquiries
have
already
been
made
at
the
foundling
and
those
who
inquired
have
been
sent
away
disappointed
they
will
inquire
no
more
and
is
a
parent
love
so
trifling
that
one
disappointment
will
drive
him
from
seeking
of
his
child
no
no
japhet
if
thou
art
yearned
for
thou
wilt
be
found
and
fresh
inquiries
will
be
made
but
thy
search
is
unavailing
and
already
hast
thou
lost
much
time
true
susannah
thy
advise
is
good
replied
mrs
cophagus
in
following
a
shadow
japhet
hath
much
neglected
the
substance
it
is
time
that
thou
shouldst
settle
thyself
and
earn
thy
livelihood
and
do
thy
duty
in
that
path
of
life
to
which
it
hath
pleased
god
to
call
thee
continued
susannah
who
with
mrs
cophagus
walked
out
of
the
room
cophagus
then
took
up
the
conversation
and
pointing
out
the
uselessness
of
my
roving
about
and
the
propriety
of
my
settling
in
life
proposed
that
i
should
take
an
apothecary
shop
for
which
he
would
furnish
the
means
and
that
he
could
insure
me
the
custom
of
the
whole
society
of
friends
in
reading
which
was
very
large
as
there
was
not
one
of
the
sect
in
that
line
of
business
become
one
of
us
japhet
good
business
marry
happy
life
little
children
and
so
on
i
thought
of
susannah
and
was
silent
cophagus
then
said
i
had
better
reflect
upon
his
offer
and
make
up
my
determination
if
that
did
not
suit
me
he
would
still
give
me
all
the
assistance
in
his
power
i
did
reflect
long
before
i
could
make
up
my
mind
i
was
still
worldly
inclined
still
my
fancy
would
revel
in
the
idea
of
finding
out
my
father
in
high
life
and
as
once
more
appearing
as
a
star
of
fashion
of
returning
with
interest
the
contumely
i
had
lately
received
and
as
a
right
that
position
in
society
which
i
had
held
under
false
colours
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
sinking
at
once
into
a
tradesman
and
probably
ending
my
days
in
obscurity
pride
was
still
my
ruling
passion
such
were
my
first
impulses
and
then
i
looked
upon
the
other
side
of
the
picture
i
was
without
the
means
necessary
to
support
myself
i
could
not
return
to
high
life
without
i
discovered
my
parents
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
found
them
to
be
such
as
my
warm
imagination
had
depicted
i
had
no
chance
of
finding
them
i
had
already
been
long
seeking
in
vain
i
had
been
twice
taken
up
to
bow
street
nearly
lost
my
life
in
ireland
had
been
sentenced
to
death
had
been
insane
and
recovered
by
a
miracle
and
all
in
prosecuting
this
useless
search
all
this
had
much
contributed
to
cure
me
of
the
monomania
i
agreed
with
susannah
that
the
search
must
be
made
by
the
other
parties
and
not
by
me
i
recalled
the
treatment
i
had
received
from
the
world
the
contempt
with
which
i
had
been
treated
the
heartlessness
of
high
life
and
the
little
chance
of
my
ever
again
being
admitted
into
fashionable
society
i
placed
all
this
in
juxtaposition
with
the
kindness
of
those
with
whom
i
now
resided
what
they
had
done
already
for
me
and
what
they
now
offered
which
was
to
make
me
independent
by
my
own
exertions
i
weighed
all
in
my
mind
was
still
undecided
for
my
pride
still
carried
its
weight
when
i
thought
of
the
pure
beautiful
susannah
temple
and
my
decision
was
made
i
would
not
lose
the
substance
by
running
after
shadows
that
evening
with
many
thanks
i
accepted
the
kind
offers
of
mr
cophagus
and
expressed
my
determination
of
entering
into
the
society
of
friends
thou
hast
chosen
wisely
said
mrs
cophagus
extending
her
hand
to
me
and
it
is
with
pleasure
that
we
shall
receive
thee
i
welcome
thee
japhet
newland
said
susannah
also
offering
her
hand
and
i
trust
that
thou
wilt
find
more
happiness
among
those
with
whom
thou
art
about
to
sojourn
than
in
the
world
of
vanity
and
deceit
in
which
thou
hast
hitherto
played
thy
part
no
longer
seek
an
earthly
father
who
hath
deserted
thee
but
a
heavenly
father
who
will
not
desert
thee
in
thy
afflictions
you
shall
direct
me
into
the
right
path
susannah
replied
i
i
am
too
young
to
be
a
guide
japhet
replied
she
smiling
but
not
too
young
i
hope
to
be
a
friend
the
next
day
my
clothes
came
home
and
i
put
them
on
i
looked
at
myself
in
the
glass
and
was
anything
but
pleased
but
as
my
head
was
shaved
it
was
of
little
consequence
what
i
wore
so
i
consoled
myself
mr
cophagus
sent
for
a
barber
and
ordered
me
a
wig
which
was
to
be
ready
in
a
few
days
when
it
was
ready
i
put
it
on
and
altogether
did
not
dislike
my
appearance
i
flattered
myself
that
if
i
was
a
quaker
at
all
events
i
was
a
very
good
looking
and
a
very
smart
one
and
when
a
day
or
two
afterwards
a
reunion
of
friends
took
place
at
mr
cophagus
house
to
introduce
me
to
them
i
perceived
with
much
satisfaction
that
there
was
no
young
man
who
could
compete
with
me
after
this
i
was
much
more
reconciled
to
my
transformation
part
three
chapter
ten
i
prosper
in
every
way
and
become
reconciled
to
my
situation
mr
cophagus
was
not
idle
in
a
few
weeks
he
had
rented
a
shop
for
me
and
furnished
it
much
better
than
his
own
in
smithfield
the
upper
part
of
the
house
was
let
off
as
i
was
to
reside
with
the
family
when
it
was
ready
i
went
over
it
with
him
and
was
satisfied
all
i
wished
for
was
timothy
as
an
assistant
but
that
wish
was
unavailing
as
i
knew
not
where
to
find
him
that
evening
i
observed
to
mr
cophagus
that
i
did
not
much
like
putting
my
name
over
the
shop
the
fact
was
that
my
pride
forbade
it
and
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
that
japhet
newland
at
whose
knock
every
aristocratic
door
had
flown
open
should
appear
in
gold
letters
above
a
there
are
many
reasons
against
it
observed
i
one
is
that
it
is
not
my
real
name
i
should
like
to
take
the
name
of
cophagus
another
is
that
the
name
being
so
well
known
may
attract
those
who
formerly
knew
me
and
i
should
not
wish
that
they
should
come
in
and
mock
me
another
is
japhet
newland
interrupted
susannah
with
more
severity
than
i
ever
had
seen
in
her
sweet
countenance
do
not
trouble
thyself
with
giving
thy
reasons
seeing
thou
hast
given
every
reason
but
the
right
one
which
is
that
thy
pride
revolts
at
it
i
was
about
to
observe
replied
i
that
it
was
a
name
that
sounded
of
mammon
and
not
fitting
for
one
of
our
persuasion
but
susannah
you
have
accused
me
of
pride
and
i
will
now
raise
no
further
objections
japhet
newland
it
shall
be
and
let
us
speak
no
more
upon
the
subject
if
i
have
wronged
thee
japhet
much
do
i
crave
thy
forgiveness
replied
susannah
but
it
is
god
alone
who
knoweth
the
secrets
of
our
hearts
i
was
presumptuous
and
you
must
pardon
me
susannah
it
is
i
who
ought
to
plead
for
pardon
you
know
me
better
than
i
know
myself
it
was
pride
and
nothing
but
pride
but
you
have
cured
me
truly
have
i
hopes
of
thee
now
japhet
replied
susannah
smiling
those
who
confess
their
faults
will
soon
amend
them
yet
i
do
think
there
is
some
reason
in
thy
observation
for
who
knoweth
but
meeting
with
thy
former
associates
thou
mayst
not
be
tempted
into
falling
away
thou
mayst
spell
thy
name
as
thou
listest
and
peradventure
it
would
be
better
to
disguise
it
so
agreed
mr
and
mrs
cophagus
and
i
therefore
had
it
written
and
having
engaged
a
person
of
the
society
strongly
recommended
to
me
as
an
assistant
i
took
possession
of
my
shop
and
was
very
soon
busy
in
making
up
prescriptions
and
dispensing
my
medicines
in
all
quarters
of
the
good
town
of
reading
and
i
was
happy
i
had
enjoyment
during
the
day
my
profession
was
at
all
events
liberal
i
was
dressed
and
lived
as
a
gentleman
or
rather
i
should
say
respectably
i
was
earning
my
own
livelihood
i
was
a
useful
member
of
society
and
when
i
retired
home
to
meals
and
late
at
night
i
found
that
if
cophagus
and
his
wife
had
retired
susannah
temple
always
waited
up
and
remained
with
me
a
few
minutes
i
had
never
been
in
love
until
i
had
fallen
in
with
this
perfect
creature
but
my
love
for
her
was
not
the
love
of
the
world
i
could
not
so
depreciate
her
i
loved
her
as
a
superior
being
i
loved
her
with
fear
and
trembling
i
felt
that
she
was
too
pure
too
holy
too
good
for
a
vain
worldly
creature
like
myself
i
felt
as
if
my
destiny
depended
upon
her
and
her
fiat
that
if
she
favoured
me
my
happiness
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
were
secured
that
if
she
rejected
me
i
was
cast
away
for
ever
such
was
my
feeling
for
susannah
temple
who
perfect
as
she
was
was
still
a
woman
and
perceived
her
power
over
me
but
unlike
the
many
of
her
sex
exerted
that
power
only
to
lead
to
what
was
right
insensibly
almost
my
pride
was
quelled
and
i
became
humble
and
religiously
inclined
even
the
peculiarities
of
the
sect
their
meeting
at
their
places
of
worship
their
drawling
and
their
quaint
manner
of
talking
became
no
longer
a
subject
of
dislike
i
found
out
causes
and
good
reasons
for
everything
which
before
appeared
strange
sermons
in
stones
and
good
in
everything
months
passed
away
my
business
prospered
i
had
nearly
repaid
the
money
advanced
by
mr
cophagus
i
was
in
heart
and
soul
a
quaker
and
i
entered
into
the
fraternity
with
a
feeling
that
i
could
act
up
to
what
i
had
promised
i
was
happy
quite
happy
and
yet
i
had
never
received
from
susannah
temple
any
further
than
the
proofs
of
sincere
friendship
but
i
had
much
of
her
society
and
we
were
now
very
very
intimate
i
found
out
what
warm
what
devoted
feelings
were
concealed
under
her
modest
quiet
exterior
how
well
her
mind
was
stored
and
how
right
was
that
mind
often
when
i
talked
over
past
events
did
i
listen
to
her
remarks
all
tending
to
one
point
morality
and
virtue
often
did
i
receive
from
her
at
first
a
severe
but
latterly
a
kind
rebuke
when
my
discourse
was
light
and
frivolous
but
when
i
talked
of
merry
subjects
which
were
innocent
what
could
be
more
joyous
or
more
exhilarating
than
her
laugh
what
more
intoxicating
than
her
sweet
smile
when
she
approved
of
my
sentiments
and
when
animated
by
the
subject
what
could
be
more
musical
or
more
impassioned
than
her
bursts
of
eloquence
which
were
invariably
followed
by
a
deep
blush
when
she
recollected
how
she
had
been
carried
away
by
excitement
there
was
one
point
upon
which
i
congratulated
myself
which
was
that
she
had
received
two
or
three
unexceptionable
offers
of
marriage
during
the
six
months
that
i
had
been
in
her
company
and
refused
them
at
the
end
of
that
period
thanks
to
the
assistance
i
received
from
the
friends
i
had
paid
mr
cophagus
all
the
money
which
he
had
advanced
and
found
myself
in
possession
of
a
flourishing
business
and
independent
i
then
requested
that
i
might
be
allowed
to
pay
an
annual
stipend
for
my
board
and
lodging
commencing
from
the
time
i
first
came
to
his
house
mr
cophagus
said
i
was
right
the
terms
were
easily
arranged
and
i
was
independent
still
my
advances
with
susannah
were
slow
but
if
slow
they
were
sure
one
day
i
observed
to
her
how
happy
mr
cophagus
appeared
to
be
as
a
married
man
her
reply
was
he
is
japhet
he
has
worked
hard
for
his
independence
and
he
is
now
reaping
the
fruits
of
his
industry
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
i
must
do
the
same
thought
i
and
that
i
have
no
business
to
propose
for
a
wife
until
i
am
certain
that
i
am
able
to
provide
for
her
i
have
as
yet
laid
up
nothing
and
an
income
is
not
a
capital
i
felt
that
whether
a
party
interested
or
not
she
was
right
and
i
redoubled
my
diligence
part
three
chapter
eleven
a
variety
of
the
quaker
tribe
who
had
a
curious
disintegration
of
mind
and
body
i
was
not
yet
weaned
from
the
world
but
i
was
fast
advancing
to
that
state
when
a
very
smart
young
quaker
came
on
a
visit
to
reading
he
was
introduced
to
mr
and
mrs
cophagus
and
was
soon
as
might
be
expected
an
admirer
of
susannah
but
he
received
no
encouragement
he
was
an
idle
person
and
passed
much
of
his
time
sitting
in
my
shop
and
talking
with
me
and
being
much
less
reserved
and
unguarded
than
the
generality
of
the
young
men
of
the
sect
i
gradually
became
intimate
with
him
one
day
when
my
assistant
was
out
he
said
to
me
friend
tell
me
candidly
hast
thou
ever
seen
my
face
before
not
that
i
can
recollect
friend
talbot
then
my
recollection
is
better
than
yours
and
now
having
obtained
thy
friendship
as
one
of
the
society
i
will
remind
thee
of
our
former
acquaintance
when
thou
wert
mr
walking
about
town
with
major
carbonnell
i
was
lieutenant
talbot
of
the
dragoon
guards
i
was
dumb
with
astonishment
and
i
stared
him
in
the
face
yes
continued
he
bursting
into
laughter
such
is
the
fact
you
have
thought
perhaps
that
you
were
the
only
man
of
fashion
who
had
ever
been
transformed
into
a
quaker
now
you
behold
another
so
no
longer
imagine
yourself
the
phoenix
of
your
tribe
i
do
certainly
recollect
that
name
replied
i
but
although
as
you
must
be
acquainted
with
my
history
it
is
very
easy
to
conceive
why
i
have
joined
the
society
yet
upon
what
grounds
you
can
have
so
done
is
to
me
inexplicable
newland
it
certainly
does
require
explanation
it
has
been
i
assert
my
misfortune
and
not
my
fault
not
that
i
am
not
happy
on
the
contrary
i
feel
that
i
am
now
in
my
proper
situation
i
ought
to
have
been
born
of
quaker
parents
at
all
events
i
was
born
a
quaker
in
disposition
but
i
will
come
early
and
then
if
you
will
give
your
man
something
to
do
out
of
the
way
i
will
tell
you
my
history
i
know
that
you
will
keep
my
secret
the
next
morning
he
came
and
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
he
imparted
to
me
what
follows
i
recollect
well
newland
when
you
were
one
of
the
leaders
of
fashion
i
was
then
in
the
dragoon
guards
and
although
not
very
intimate
with
you
had
the
honour
of
a
recognition
when
we
met
at
parties
i
can
not
help
laughing
upon
my
soul
when
i
look
at
us
both
now
but
never
mind
i
was
of
course
a
great
deal
with
my
regiment
and
at
the
club
my
father
as
you
may
not
perhaps
be
aware
was
highly
connected
and
all
the
family
have
been
brought
up
in
the
army
the
question
of
profession
has
never
been
mooted
by
us
and
every
talbot
has
turned
out
a
soldier
as
naturally
as
a
young
duck
takes
to
the
water
well
i
entered
the
army
admired
my
uniform
and
was
admired
by
the
young
ladies
before
i
received
my
lieutenant
commission
my
father
the
old
gentleman
died
and
left
me
a
younger
brother
fortune
of
four
hundred
per
annum
but
as
my
uncle
said
was
quite
enough
for
a
talbot
who
would
push
himself
forward
in
his
profession
as
the
talbots
had
ever
done
before
him
i
soon
found
out
that
my
income
was
not
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
continue
in
the
guards
and
my
uncle
was
very
anxious
that
i
should
exchange
into
a
regiment
on
service
i
therefore
by
purchase
obtained
a
company
in
the
ordered
out
to
reduce
the
french
colonies
in
the
west
indies
and
i
sailed
with
all
the
expectation
of
covering
myself
with
as
much
glory
as
the
talbots
had
done
from
time
immemorial
we
landed
and
in
a
short
time
the
bullets
and
grape
were
flying
in
all
directions
and
then
i
discovered
what
i
declare
never
for
a
moment
came
into
my
head
before
to
wit
that
i
had
mistaken
my
profession
how
do
you
mean
talbot
mean
why
that
i
was
deficient
in
a
certain
qualification
which
never
was
before
denied
to
a
talbot
courage
and
you
never
knew
that
before
never
upon
my
honour
my
mind
was
always
full
of
courage
in
my
mind
eye
i
built
castles
of
feats
of
bravery
which
should
eclipse
all
the
talbots
from
him
who
burnt
joan
of
arc
down
to
the
present
day
i
assure
you
that
surprised
as
other
people
were
no
one
was
more
surprised
than
myself
our
regiment
was
ordered
to
advance
and
i
led
on
my
company
the
bullets
flew
like
hail
i
tried
to
go
on
but
i
could
not
at
last
notwithstanding
all
my
endeavours
to
the
contrary
i
fairly
took
to
my
heels
i
was
met
by
the
commanding
officer
in
fact
i
ran
right
against
him
he
ordered
me
back
and
i
returned
to
my
regiment
not
feeling
at
all
afraid
again
i
was
in
the
fire
again
i
resisted
the
impulse
but
it
was
of
no
use
and
at
last
just
before
the
assault
took
place
i
ran
away
as
if
the
devil
was
after
me
was
it
odd
very
odd
indeed
replied
i
laughing
yes
but
you
do
not
exactly
understand
why
it
was
you
know
what
philosophers
tell
you
about
volition
and
that
the
body
is
governed
by
the
mind
consequently
obeys
it
now
you
see
in
my
case
it
was
exactly
reversed
i
tell
you
that
it
is
a
fact
that
in
mind
i
am
as
brave
as
any
man
in
existence
but
i
had
a
cowardly
carcass
and
what
is
still
worse
it
proved
the
master
of
my
mind
and
ran
away
with
it
i
had
no
mind
to
run
away
on
the
contrary
i
wished
to
have
been
of
the
forlorn
hope
and
had
volunteered
but
was
refused
surely
if
i
had
not
courage
i
should
have
avoided
such
a
post
of
danger
is
it
not
so
it
certainly
appears
strange
that
you
should
volunteer
for
the
forlorn
hope
and
then
run
away
that
just
what
i
say
i
have
the
soul
of
the
talbots
but
a
body
which
do
belong
to
the
family
and
too
powerful
for
the
soul
so
it
appears
well
go
on
it
was
go
off
instead
of
going
on
i
tried
again
that
day
to
mount
the
breach
and
as
the
fire
was
over
i
succeeded
but
there
was
a
mark
against
me
and
it
was
intimated
that
i
should
have
an
opportunity
of
redeeming
my
character
well
there
was
a
fort
to
be
stormed
the
next
day
and
i
requested
to
lead
my
company
in
advance
surely
that
was
no
proof
of
want
of
courage
permission
was
granted
we
were
warmly
received
and
i
felt
that
my
legs
refused
to
advance
so
what
did
i
do
i
tied
my
sash
round
my
thigh
and
telling
the
men
that
i
was
wounded
requested
they
would
carry
me
to
the
attack
surely
that
was
courage
most
undoubtedly
so
it
was
like
a
talbot
we
were
at
the
foot
of
the
breach
when
the
shot
flew
about
me
i
kicked
and
wrestled
so
that
the
two
men
who
carried
me
were
obliged
to
let
me
go
and
my
rascally
body
was
at
liberty
i
say
unfortunately
for
only
conceive
if
they
had
carried
me
wounded
up
the
breach
what
an
heroic
act
it
would
have
been
considered
on
my
part
but
fate
decided
it
otherwise
if
i
had
lain
still
when
they
dropped
me
i
should
have
done
well
but
i
was
anxious
to
get
up
the
breach
that
is
my
mind
was
so
bent
but
as
soon
as
i
got
on
my
legs
confound
them
if
they
did
run
away
with
me
and
then
i
was
found
half
a
mile
from
the
fort
with
a
pretended
wound
that
was
enough
i
had
a
hint
that
the
sooner
i
went
home
the
better
on
account
of
the
family
i
was
permitted
to
sell
out
and
then
i
walked
the
streets
as
a
private
gentleman
but
no
one
would
speak
to
me
i
argued
the
point
with
several
but
they
were
obstinate
and
would
not
be
convinced
they
said
that
it
was
no
use
talking
about
being
brave
if
i
ran
away
they
were
not
philosophers
talbot
no
they
could
not
comprehend
how
the
mind
and
the
body
could
be
at
variance
it
was
no
use
arguing
they
would
have
it
that
the
movements
of
the
body
depended
upon
the
mind
and
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
and
that
i
was
a
coward
in
soul
as
well
as
body
well
what
did
you
do
oh
i
did
nothing
i
had
a
great
mind
to
knock
them
down
but
as
i
knew
my
body
would
not
assist
me
i
thought
it
better
to
leave
it
alone
however
they
taunted
me
so
by
calling
me
fighting
tom
that
my
uncle
shut
his
door
upon
me
as
a
disgrace
to
the
family
saying
he
wished
the
first
bullet
had
laid
me
dead
very
kind
of
him
at
last
my
patience
was
worn
out
and
i
looked
about
to
find
whether
there
were
not
some
people
who
did
not
consider
courage
as
a
qua
i
found
that
the
quakers
tenets
were
against
fighting
and
therefore
courage
could
not
be
necessary
so
i
have
joined
them
and
i
find
that
if
not
a
good
soldier
i
am
at
all
events
a
very
respectable
quaker
and
now
you
have
the
whole
of
my
story
and
tell
me
if
you
are
of
my
opinion
why
really
it
a
very
difficult
point
to
decide
i
never
heard
such
a
case
of
disintegration
before
i
must
think
upon
it
of
course
you
will
not
say
a
word
about
it
newland
never
fear
i
will
keep
your
secret
talbot
how
long
have
you
worn
the
dress
oh
more
than
a
year
what
a
nice
young
person
that
susannah
temple
is
i
a
great
mind
to
propose
for
her
but
you
must
first
ascertain
what
your
body
says
to
it
talbot
replied
i
sternly
i
allow
no
one
to
interfere
with
me
quaker
or
not
my
dear
fellow
i
beg
your
pardon
i
shall
think
no
more
about
her
said
talbot
rising
up
as
he
observed
that
i
looked
very
fierce
i
wish
you
a
good
morning
i
leave
reading
i
will
call
on
you
and
say
if
i
can
and
i
saw
no
more
of
friend
talbot
whose
mind
was
all
courage
but
whose
body
was
so
renegade
part
three
chapter
twelve
i
fall
in
with
timothy
about
a
month
after
this
i
heard
a
sailor
with
one
leg
and
a
handful
of
ballads
singing
in
a
most
lachrymal
tone
why
what
is
that
to
you
if
my
eyes
i
a
wiping
a
tear
is
a
pleasure
d
see
in
its
way
bless
your
honour
shy
a
copper
to
poor
jack
who
lost
his
leg
in
the
sarvice
thanky
your
honour
and
he
continued
it
nonsense
for
trifles
i
own
to
be
piping
but
they
who
ca
pity
why
i
pities
they
says
the
captain
says
he
i
shall
never
forget
it
of
courage
you
know
boys
the
true
from
the
sham
back
your
your
worship
for
half
a
minute
and
just
assist
a
poor
dismantled
craft
who
has
been
riddled
in
the
a
furious
lion
long
life
to
your
battle
so
let
it
is
a
furious
lion
in
battle
so
let
it
but
duty
appeased
but
duty
appeased
buy
a
song
young
woman
to
sing
to
your
sweetheart
while
you
sit
on
his
knee
in
the
but
duty
appeased
is
the
heart
of
a
lamb
i
believe
there
are
few
people
who
do
not
take
a
strong
interest
in
the
english
sailor
particularly
in
one
who
has
been
maimed
in
the
defence
of
his
country
i
always
have
and
as
i
heard
the
poor
disabled
fellow
bawling
out
his
ditty
certainly
not
with
a
very
remarkable
voice
or
execution
i
pulled
out
the
drawer
behind
the
counter
and
took
out
some
halfpence
to
give
him
when
i
caught
his
eye
i
beckoned
to
him
and
he
entered
the
shop
here
my
good
fellow
said
i
although
a
man
of
peace
myself
yet
i
feel
for
those
who
suffer
in
the
wars
and
i
put
the
money
to
him
may
your
honour
never
know
a
banyan
day
replied
the
sailor
and
a
sickly
season
for
you
into
the
bargain
nay
friend
that
is
not
a
kind
wish
to
others
replied
i
the
sailor
fixed
his
eyes
earnestly
upon
me
as
if
in
astonishment
for
until
i
had
answered
he
had
not
looked
at
me
particularly
what
are
you
looking
at
said
i
good
heavens
exclaimed
he
it
is
yet
it
can
not
be
can
not
be
what
friend
he
ran
out
of
the
door
and
read
the
name
over
the
shop
and
then
came
in
and
sank
upon
a
chair
outside
of
the
counter
japhet
i
have
found
you
at
last
exclaimed
he
faintly
good
heaven
who
are
you
he
threw
off
his
hat
with
false
ringlets
fastened
to
the
inside
of
it
and
i
beheld
in
a
moment
i
sprang
over
the
counter
and
was
in
his
arms
is
it
possible
exclaimed
i
after
a
short
silence
on
both
sides
that
i
find
you
a
disabled
sailor
is
it
possible
japhet
replied
timothy
that
i
find
you
a
quaker
even
so
timothy
i
am
really
and
truly
one
then
you
are
less
disguised
than
i
am
replied
timothy
kicking
off
his
wooden
leg
and
letting
down
his
own
which
had
been
tied
up
to
his
thigh
and
concealed
in
his
wide
blue
trowsers
i
am
no
more
a
sailor
than
you
are
japhet
and
since
you
left
me
have
never
yet
seen
the
salt
water
which
i
talk
and
sing
so
much
about
then
thou
hast
been
deceiving
timothy
which
i
regret
much
now
i
do
perceive
that
you
are
a
quaker
replied
tim
but
do
not
blame
me
until
you
have
heard
my
story
thank
god
i
have
found
you
at
last
but
tell
me
japhet
you
will
not
send
me
away
will
you
if
your
dress
is
changed
you
heart
is
not
pray
answer
me
before
i
say
anything
more
you
know
i
can
be
useful
here
indeed
timothy
i
have
often
wished
for
you
since
i
have
been
here
and
it
will
be
your
own
fault
if
i
part
with
you
you
shall
assist
me
in
the
shop
but
you
must
dress
like
me
dress
like
you
have
i
not
always
dressed
like
you
when
we
started
from
cophagus
were
we
not
dressed
much
alike
did
we
not
wear
spangled
jackets
together
did
i
not
wear
your
livery
and
belong
to
you
i
put
on
anything
japhet
but
we
must
not
part
again
my
dear
timothy
i
trust
we
shall
not
but
i
expect
my
assistant
here
soon
and
do
not
wish
that
he
should
see
you
in
that
garb
go
to
a
small
at
the
farther
end
of
this
street
and
when
you
see
me
pass
come
out
to
me
and
we
will
walk
out
into
the
country
and
consult
together
i
have
put
up
at
a
small
house
not
far
off
and
have
some
clothes
there
i
will
alter
my
dress
and
meet
you
god
bless
you
japhet
timothy
then
picked
up
his
ballads
which
were
scattered
on
the
floor
put
up
his
leg
and
putting
on
his
wooden
stump
hastened
away
after
once
more
silently
pressing
my
hand
in
half
an
hour
my
assistant
returned
and
i
desired
him
to
remain
in
the
shop
as
i
was
going
out
on
business
i
then
walked
to
the
appointed
rendezvous
and
was
soon
joined
by
tim
who
had
discarded
his
sailor
disguise
and
was
in
what
is
called
a
sort
of
dress
after
the
first
renewed
greeting
i
requested
tim
to
let
me
know
what
had
occurred
to
him
since
our
separation
you
can
not
imagine
japhet
what
my
feelings
were
when
i
found
by
your
note
that
you
had
left
me
i
had
perceived
how
unhappy
you
had
been
for
a
long
while
and
i
was
equally
distressed
although
i
knew
not
the
cause
i
had
no
idea
until
i
got
your
letter
that
you
had
lost
all
your
money
and
i
felt
it
more
unkind
of
you
to
leave
me
then
than
if
you
had
been
comfortable
and
independent
as
for
looking
after
you
that
i
knew
would
be
useless
and
i
immediately
went
to
mr
masterton
to
take
his
advice
as
to
how
i
should
proceed
mr
masterton
had
received
your
letter
and
appeared
to
be
very
much
annoyed
foolish
boy
said
he
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
done
now
he
is
mad
and
that
is
all
that
can
be
said
in
his
excuse
you
must
do
as
he
tells
you
i
suppose
and
try
the
best
for
yourself
i
will
help
you
in
any
way
that
i
can
my
poor
fellow
said
he
do
cry
i
went
back
to
the
house
and
collected
together
your
papers
which
i
sealed
up
i
knew
that
the
house
was
to
be
given
up
in
a
few
days
i
sold
the
furniture
and
made
the
best
i
could
of
the
remainder
of
your
wardrobe
and
other
things
of
value
that
you
had
left
indeed
everything
with
the
exception
of
the
and
pistols
which
had
belonged
to
major
carbonnell
and
i
thought
you
might
perhaps
some
day
like
to
have
them
how
very
kind
of
you
timothy
to
think
of
me
in
that
way
i
shall
indeed
be
glad
but
no
what
have
i
to
do
with
pistols
or
silver
now
i
must
not
have
them
but
still
i
thank
you
all
the
same
the
furniture
and
everything
else
fetched
pounds
after
all
expenses
were
paid
i
am
glad
of
it
timothy
for
your
sake
but
i
am
sorry
judging
by
your
present
plight
that
if
appears
to
have
done
you
but
little
good
because
i
did
not
make
use
of
it
japhet
what
could
i
do
with
all
that
money
i
took
it
to
mr
masterton
with
all
your
papers
and
the
and
pistols
he
has
it
now
ready
for
you
when
you
ask
for
it
he
was
very
kind
to
me
and
offered
to
do
anything
for
me
but
i
resolved
to
go
in
search
of
you
i
had
more
money
in
my
pocket
when
you
went
away
than
i
generally
have
and
with
the
surplus
of
what
you
left
for
the
bills
i
had
twelve
or
fourteen
pounds
so
i
wished
mr
masterton
and
have
ever
since
been
on
my
adventures
in
search
of
my
master
not
master
timothy
say
rather
of
your
friend
well
of
both
if
you
please
japhet
and
very
pretty
adventures
i
have
had
i
assure
you
and
some
very
hairbreadth
escapes
i
think
when
we
compare
notes
mine
will
be
found
most
eventful
timothy
but
we
can
talk
of
them
and
compare
notes
another
time
at
present
whom
do
you
think
i
am
residing
with
a
quaker
i
presume
you
have
guessed
right
so
far
but
who
do
you
think
that
quaker
is
there
i
at
fault
mr
cophagus
at
this
intelligence
timothy
gave
a
leap
in
the
air
turned
round
on
his
heel
and
tumbled
on
the
grass
in
a
fit
of
immoderate
laughter
cophagus
a
quaker
cried
he
at
last
o
i
long
to
see
him
snuffle
snuffle
broad
brims
wide
skirts
and
so
on
capital
it
is
very
true
timothy
but
you
must
not
mock
at
the
persuasion
i
did
not
intend
it
japhet
but
there
is
something
to
me
so
ridiculous
in
the
idea
but
continued
timothy
is
it
not
still
stranger
that
after
having
separated
so
many
years
we
should
all
meet
again
and
that
i
should
find
mr
cophagus
an
apothecary
shop
you
dispensing
medicines
and
i
as
i
hope
to
be
carrying
them
about
as
i
did
before
well
i
will
row
in
the
same
boat
and
i
will
be
a
quaker
as
well
as
you
both
well
we
will
now
return
and
i
will
take
you
to
mr
cophagus
who
will
i
am
sure
be
glad
to
see
you
first
japhet
let
me
have
some
quaker
clothes
i
should
prefer
it
you
shall
have
a
suit
of
mine
timothy
since
you
wish
it
but
recollect
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
nor
indeed
will
it
be
permitted
that
you
enter
into
the
sect
without
preparatory
examination
as
to
your
fitness
for
admission
i
then
went
to
the
shop
and
sending
out
the
assistant
walked
home
and
took
out
a
worn
suit
of
clothes
with
which
i
hastened
to
timothy
he
put
them
on
in
the
shop
and
then
walking
behind
the
counter
said
this
is
my
place
and
here
i
shall
remain
as
long
as
you
do
i
hope
so
timothy
as
for
the
one
who
is
with
me
at
present
i
can
easily
procure
him
other
employment
and
he
will
not
be
sorry
to
go
for
he
is
a
married
man
and
does
not
like
the
confinement
i
have
some
money
said
timothy
taking
out
of
his
old
clothes
a
dirty
rag
and
producing
nearly
twenty
pounds
i
am
well
off
you
see
you
are
indeed
replied
i
yes
there
is
nothing
like
being
a
sailor
with
one
leg
singing
ballads
do
you
know
japhet
that
sometimes
have
taken
more
than
a
pound
a
day
since
i
have
shammed
the
sailor
not
very
honestly
tim
perhaps
not
japhet
but
it
is
very
strange
and
yet
very
true
that
when
honest
i
could
make
nothing
and
when
i
deceived
i
have
done
very
well
part
three
chapter
thirteen
timothy
commences
his
narrative
of
his
search
after
japhet
i
could
not
help
calling
to
mind
that
the
same
consequences
as
timothy
related
in
the
last
chapter
had
occurred
to
me
during
my
eventful
career
but
i
had
long
considered
that
there
was
no
excuse
for
dishonesty
and
that
in
the
end
it
would
only
lead
to
exposure
and
disgrace
i
went
home
early
in
the
evening
to
introduce
timothy
to
mr
cophagus
who
received
him
with
great
kindness
and
agreed
immediately
that
he
ought
to
be
with
me
in
the
shop
timothy
paid
his
respects
to
the
ladies
and
then
went
down
with
ephraim
who
took
him
under
his
protection
in
a
few
days
he
was
as
established
with
us
as
if
he
had
been
living
with
us
for
months
i
had
some
trouble
at
first
in
checking
his
vivacity
and
turn
for
ridicule
but
that
was
gradually
effected
and
i
found
him
not
only
a
great
acquisition
but
as
he
always
was
a
cheerful
and
affectionate
companion
i
had
during
the
first
days
of
our
meeting
recounted
my
adventures
and
made
many
inquiries
of
timothy
relative
to
my
few
friends
he
told
me
that
from
mr
masterton
he
had
learnt
that
lady
de
clare
and
fleta
had
called
upon
him
very
much
afflicted
with
the
contents
of
my
letter
that
lord
windermear
also
had
been
very
much
vexed
and
annoyed
that
mr
masterton
had
advised
him
to
obtain
another
situation
as
a
valet
which
he
had
refused
and
at
the
same
time
told
him
his
intention
of
searching
for
me
he
had
promised
mr
masterton
to
let
him
know
if
he
found
me
and
then
bade
him
farewell
i
used
to
lie
in
bed
japhet
continued
timothy
and
think
upon
the
best
method
of
proceeding
at
last
i
agreed
to
myself
that
to
look
for
you
as
you
looked
after
your
father
would
be
a
chase
and
that
my
money
would
soon
be
gone
so
i
reflected
whether
i
might
not
take
up
some
roving
trade
which
would
support
me
and
at
the
same
time
enable
me
to
proceed
from
place
to
place
what
do
you
think
was
my
first
speculation
why
i
saw
a
man
with
a
dog
harnessed
in
a
little
cart
crying
dog
meat
and
cat
meat
and
i
said
to
myself
there
the
very
thing
there
a
profession
i
can
travel
and
earn
my
livelihood
i
entered
into
conversation
with
him
as
he
stopped
at
a
low
treating
him
to
a
pot
of
beer
and
having
gained
all
i
wanted
as
to
the
mysteries
of
the
profession
i
called
for
another
pot
and
proposed
that
i
should
purchase
his
whole
concern
down
to
his
knife
and
apron
the
fellow
agreed
and
after
a
good
deal
of
bargaining
i
paid
him
three
guineas
for
the
or
which
you
please
he
asked
me
whether
i
meant
to
hawk
in
london
or
not
and
i
told
him
no
that
i
should
travel
the
country
he
advised
the
western
road
as
there
were
more
populous
towns
in
it
well
we
had
another
pot
to
clench
the
bargain
and
i
paid
down
the
money
and
took
possession
quite
delighted
with
my
new
occupation
away
i
went
to
brentford
selling
a
bit
here
and
there
by
the
way
and
at
last
arrived
at
the
very
bench
where
we
had
sat
down
together
and
eaten
our
meal
it
is
strange
that
i
did
the
same
and
a
very
unlucky
bench
it
proved
to
me
so
it
did
to
me
as
you
shall
hear
i
had
taken
up
my
quarters
at
that
inn
and
for
three
days
had
done
very
well
in
brentford
on
the
third
evening
i
had
just
come
back
it
was
nearly
dusk
and
i
took
my
seat
on
the
bench
thinking
of
you
my
dog
rather
tired
was
lying
down
before
the
cart
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
heard
a
sharp
whistle
the
dog
sprang
on
his
legs
immediately
and
ran
off
several
yards
before
i
could
prevent
him
the
whistle
was
repeated
and
away
went
the
dog
and
cart
like
lightning
i
ran
as
fast
i
could
but
could
not
overtake
him
and
i
perceived
that
his
old
master
was
running
ahead
of
the
dog
as
hard
as
he
could
and
this
was
the
reason
why
the
dog
was
off
still
i
should
i
think
have
overtaken
him
but
an
old
woman
coming
out
of
a
door
with
a
saucepan
to
pour
the
hot
water
into
the
gutter
i
knocked
her
down
and
tumbled
right
over
her
into
a
cellar
without
steps
there
i
was
and
before
i
could
climb
out
again
man
dog
cart
cat
meat
and
meat
had
all
vanished
and
i
have
never
seen
them
since
the
rascal
got
clear
off
and
i
was
a
bankrupt
so
much
for
my
first
set
up
in
business
you
forgot
to
purchase
the
when
you
made
your
bargain
timothy
for
the
stock
in
trade
very
true
japhet
however
after
receiving
a
very
fair
share
of
abuse
from
the
old
woman
and
a
plaster
of
hot
greens
in
my
face
for
she
went
supperless
to
bed
rather
than
not
have
her
revenge
i
walked
back
to
the
inn
and
sat
down
in
the
tap
the
two
men
next
to
me
were
hawkers
one
carried
a
large
pack
of
dimities
and
calicoes
and
the
other
a
box
full
of
combs
needles
tapes
scissors
knives
and
trinkets
i
entered
into
conversation
with
them
and
as
i
again
stood
treat
i
soon
was
very
intimate
they
told
me
what
their
profits
were
and
how
they
contrived
to
get
on
and
i
thought
for
a
rambling
life
it
was
by
no
means
an
unpleasant
one
so
having
obtained
all
the
information
i
required
i
went
back
to
town
took
out
a
hawker
licence
for
which
i
paid
two
guineas
and
purchasing
at
a
shop
to
which
they
gave
me
a
direction
a
pretty
fair
quantity
of
articles
in
the
tape
and
scissor
line
off
i
set
once
more
on
my
travels
i
took
the
north
road
this
time
and
picked
up
a
very
comfortable
subsistence
selling
my
goods
for
a
few
halfpence
here
and
a
few
halfpence
there
at
the
cottages
as
i
passed
by
but
i
soon
found
out
that
without
a
newspaper
i
was
not
a
confirmed
hawker
and
the
more
radical
the
newspaper
the
better
a
newspaper
will
pay
half
the
expenses
of
a
hawker
if
he
can
read
at
every
house
particularly
every
small
hedge
alehouse
he
is
received
and
placed
in
the
best
corner
of
the
chimney
and
has
his
board
and
lodging
with
the
exception
of
what
he
drinks
gratis
if
he
will
pull
out
the
newspaper
and
read
it
to
those
around
him
who
can
not
read
particularly
if
he
can
explain
what
is
unintelligible
now
i
became
a
great
politician
and
moreover
a
great
radical
for
such
were
the
politics
of
all
the
lower
classes
i
lived
well
slept
well
and
sold
my
wares
very
fast
i
did
not
take
more
than
three
shillings
in
the
day
yet
as
two
out
of
the
three
were
clear
profit
i
did
pretty
well
however
a
little
accident
happened
which
obliged
me
to
change
my
profession
or
at
least
the
nature
of
the
articles
which
i
dealt
in
what
was
that
a
mere
trifle
i
had
arrived
late
at
a
small
alehouse
had
put
up
my
pack
which
was
in
a
painted
deal
box
on
the
table
in
the
and
was
very
busy
after
reading
a
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
making
a
fine
speech
which
i
always
found
was
received
with
great
applause
and
many
shakes
of
the
hand
as
a
prime
good
fellow
a
speech
about
community
of
rights
agrarian
division
and
the
propriety
of
an
equal
distribution
of
property
proving
that
as
we
were
all
born
alike
no
one
had
a
right
to
have
more
property
than
his
neighbour
the
people
had
all
gathered
round
me
applauding
violently
when
i
thought
i
might
as
well
look
after
my
pack
which
had
been
for
some
time
hidden
from
my
sight
by
the
crowd
when
to
my
mortification
i
found
out
that
my
earnest
assertions
on
the
propriety
of
community
of
property
had
had
such
an
influence
upon
some
of
my
listeners
that
they
had
walked
off
with
my
pack
and
its
contents
unfortunately
i
had
deposited
in
my
boxes
all
my
money
considering
it
safer
there
than
in
my
pockets
and
had
nothing
left
but
about
seventeen
shillings
in
silver
which
i
had
received
within
the
last
three
days
everyone
was
very
sorry
but
no
one
knew
anything
about
it
and
when
i
challenged
the
landlord
as
answerable
he
called
me
a
radical
blackguard
and
turned
me
out
of
the
door
if
you
had
looked
a
little
more
after
your
own
property
and
interfered
less
with
that
of
other
people
you
would
have
done
better
tim
observed
i
laughing
very
true
but
at
all
events
i
have
never
been
a
radical
since
replied
tim
but
to
go
on
i
walked
off
to
the
nearest
town
and
i
commenced
in
a
more
humble
way
i
purchased
a
basket
and
then
with
the
remainder
of
my
money
i
bought
the
commonest
crockery
ware
such
as
basins
jugs
mugs
and
putting
them
on
my
head
off
i
went
again
upon
my
new
speculation
i
wandered
about
with
my
crockery
but
it
was
hard
work
i
could
not
reap
the
profits
which
i
did
as
a
hawker
and
pedlar
i
averaged
however
from
seven
to
nine
shillings
a
week
and
that
was
about
sufficient
for
my
support
i
went
down
into
as
many
kitchens
as
would
have
sufficed
to
have
found
a
dozen
mothers
supposing
mine
to
be
a
cook
but
i
did
not
see
anyone
who
was
at
all
like
me
sometimes
a
cook
replaced
a
basin
she
had
broken
by
giving
me
as
much
meat
as
had
cost
her
mistress
five
shillings
and
thus
avoided
a
scolding
for
an
article
which
was
worth
only
at
other
times
a
cottager
would
give
me
a
lodging
and
would
consider
himself
rewarded
with
a
mug
that
only
cost
me
one
penny
i
was
more
than
three
months
employed
carrying
crockery
in
every
direction
and
never
during
the
whole
time
broke
one
article
until
one
day
as
i
passed
through
eton
there
was
a
regular
smash
of
the
whole
concern
indeed
how
was
that
i
met
about
a
dozen
of
the
eton
boys
and
they
proposed
a
cockshy
as
they
called
it
that
is
i
was
to
place
my
articles
on
the
top
of
a
post
and
they
were
to
throw
stones
at
them
at
a
certain
distance
paying
me
a
certain
sum
for
each
throw
well
this
i
thought
a
very
good
bargain
so
i
put
up
a
mug
worth
one
penny
at
one
penny
a
throw
it
was
knocked
down
at
the
second
shot
so
it
was
just
as
well
to
put
the
full
price
upon
them
at
once
they
were
such
remarkable
good
aimers
at
anything
each
boy
had
a
stick
upon
which
i
notched
off
their
throws
and
how
much
they
would
have
to
pay
when
all
was
over
one
article
after
another
was
put
on
the
post
until
my
basket
was
empty
and
then
i
wanted
to
settle
with
them
but
as
soon
as
i
talked
about
that
they
all
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
and
took
to
their
heels
i
chased
them
but
one
might
as
well
have
chased
eels
if
i
got
hold
of
one
the
others
pulled
me
behind
until
he
escaped
and
at
last
they
were
all
off
and
i
had
nothing
left
not
your
basket
no
not
even
that
for
while
i
was
busy
after
some
that
ran
one
way
the
others
kicked
my
basket
before
them
like
a
until
it
was
fairly
out
of
sight
i
had
only
in
my
pocket
so
you
perceive
japhet
how
i
was
going
down
in
the
world
you
were
indeed
tim
part
three
chapter
fourteen
timothy
finishes
his
narrative
well
i
walked
away
cursing
all
the
eton
boys
and
all
their
tutors
who
did
not
teach
them
honesty
as
well
as
latin
and
greek
and
put
up
at
a
very
humble
sort
of
abode
where
they
sold
small
beer
and
gave
beds
at
per
night
and
i
may
add
with
plenty
of
fleas
in
the
bargain
there
i
fell
in
with
some
ballad
singers
and
mumpers
who
were
making
very
merry
and
who
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
i
told
them
how
i
had
been
treated
and
they
laughed
at
me
but
gave
me
some
supper
so
i
forgave
them
an
old
man
who
governed
the
party
then
asked
me
whether
i
had
any
money
i
produced
my
enormous
capital
of
enough
if
you
are
clever
said
he
enough
many
a
man
with
half
that
sum
has
ended
in
rolling
in
his
carriage
a
man
with
thousands
has
only
the
advance
of
you
a
few
years
you
will
pay
for
your
lodging
and
then
spend
this
sixpence
in
matches
and
hawk
them
about
the
town
if
you
are
lucky
it
will
be
a
shilling
by
night
besides
you
go
down
into
areas
and
sometimes
enter
a
kitchen
when
the
cook
is
above
stairs
there
are
plenty
of
things
to
be
picked
up
i
am
not
dishonest
said
i
then
every
man
to
his
liking
only
if
you
were
you
would
ride
in
your
own
coach
the
sooner
suppose
i
should
lose
all
this
or
none
would
buy
my
matches
what
then
replied
i
shall
starve
no
no
no
one
starves
in
this
country
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
get
into
gaol
committed
for
a
month
you
will
live
better
perhaps
than
you
ever
did
before
i
have
been
in
every
gaol
in
england
and
i
know
the
good
ones
for
even
in
gaols
there
is
a
great
difference
now
the
one
in
this
town
is
one
of
the
best
in
all
england
and
i
patronises
it
during
the
winter
i
was
much
amused
with
the
discourse
of
this
mumper
who
appeared
to
be
one
of
the
merriest
old
vagabonds
in
england
i
took
his
advice
bought
six
pennyworth
of
matches
and
commenced
my
new
vagrant
speculation
the
first
day
i
picked
up
for
one
quarter
of
my
stock
and
returned
to
the
same
place
where
i
had
slept
the
night
before
but
the
fraternity
had
quitted
on
an
expedition
i
spent
my
in
bread
and
cheese
and
paid
one
penny
for
my
lodging
and
again
i
started
the
next
morning
but
i
was
very
unsuccessful
nobody
appeared
to
want
matches
that
day
and
after
walking
from
seven
in
the
morning
to
past
seven
in
the
evening
without
selling
one
farthing
worth
i
sat
down
at
the
porch
of
a
chapel
quite
tired
and
worn
out
at
last
i
fell
asleep
and
how
do
you
think
i
was
awoke
by
a
strong
sense
of
suffocation
and
up
i
sprang
coughing
and
nearly
choked
surrounded
with
smoke
some
mischievous
boys
perceiving
that
i
was
fast
asleep
had
set
fire
to
my
matches
as
i
held
them
in
my
hand
between
my
legs
and
i
did
not
wake
until
my
fingers
were
severely
burnt
there
was
an
end
of
my
speculation
in
matches
because
there
was
an
end
of
all
my
capital
my
poor
timothy
i
really
feel
for
you
not
at
all
my
dear
japhet
i
never
in
all
my
distress
was
sentenced
to
execution
my
miseries
were
trifles
to
be
laughed
at
however
i
felt
very
miserable
at
the
time
and
walked
off
thinking
about
the
propriety
of
getting
into
gaol
as
soon
as
i
could
for
the
beggar
had
strongly
recommended
it
i
was
at
the
outskirts
of
the
town
when
i
perceived
two
men
tussling
with
one
another
and
i
walked
towards
them
says

one
who
appeared
to
be
a
constable

come
along
with

according
to
law
wo
do
says
the
other
commands
you
in
the
king
name
to
let
me
take
you
to
prison
and
i
commands
you
also
young
man
says
he
for
i
had
walked
up
to
them
commands
you
as
a
lawful
subject
to
assist
me
will
you
give
the
poor
fellow
for
his
trouble
said
the
sailor
his
duty
as
a
lawful
subject
and
i
give
him
nothing
but
i
put
him
in
prison
if
he
do
you
old
rhinoceros
i
give
him
five
shillings
if
he
help
me
and
so
now
he
may
take
his
choice
at
all
events
thought
i
this
will
turn
out
lucky
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
will
support
the
man
who
is
most
generous
so
i
went
up
to
the
constable
who
was
a
hurley
sort
of
a
fellow
and
tripped
up
his
heels
and
down
he
came
on
the
back
of
his
head
you
know
my
old
trick
japhet
yes
i
never
knew
you
fail
at
that
the
sailor
says
to
me
a
notion
you
damaged
his
upper
works
so
let
us
start
off
and
clap
on
all
sail
for
the
next
town
i
know
where
to
drop
an
anchor
come
along
with
me
and
as
long
as
a
shot
in
the
locker
damn
me
if
i
wo
share
it
with
one
who
has
proved
a
friend
in
need
the
constable
did
not
come
to
his
senses
he
was
very
much
stunned
but
we
loosened
his
neckcloth
and
left
him
there
and
started
off
as
fast
as
we
could
my
new
companion
who
had
a
wooden
leg
stopped
by
a
gate
and
clambered
over
it
must
lose
no
time
said
he
i
may
just
as
well
have
the
benefit
of
both
legs
so
saying
he
took
off
his
wooden
stump
and
let
down
his
real
leg
which
was
fixed
up
just
as
you
saw
mine
i
made
no
comments
but
off
we
set
and
at
a
good
round
pace
gained
a
village
about
five
miles
distant
we
will
put
up
for
the
night
but
they
will
look
for
us
at
daylight
or
a
little
after
therefore
we
must
be
starting
early
i
know
the
law
beggars
well
they
wo
turn
out
afore
sunrise
he
stopped
at
a
paltry
alehouse
where
we
were
admitted
and
soon
were
busy
with
a
much
better
supper
than
i
had
ever
imagined
they
could
have
produced
but
my
new
friend
ordered
right
and
left
with
a
tone
of
authority
and
everybody
in
the
house
appeared
at
his
beck
and
command
after
a
couple
of
glasses
of
grog
we
retired
to
our
beds
the
next
morning
we
started
before
break
of
day
on
our
road
to
another
town
where
my
companion
said
the
constables
would
never
take
the
trouble
to
come
after
him
on
our
way
he
questioned
me
as
to
my
mode
of
getting
my
livelihood
and
i
narrated
how
unfortunate
i
had
been
good
turn
deserves
another
replied
the
sailor
now
i
set
you
up
in
trade
can
you
sing
have
you
anything
of
a
voice
say
that
i
have
replied
i
do
mean
whether
you
can
sing
in
tune
or
have
a
good
voice
that
no
consequence
all
i
want
to
know
is
have
you
a
good
loud
one
enough
if
that
all
all
that
requisite
so
long
as
you
can
make
yourself
heard
you
may
then
howl
like
a
jackall
or
bellow
like
a
mad
buffalo
no
matter
which
as
many
pay
us
for
to
get
rid
of
us
as
out
of
charity
and
so
long
as
the
money
comes
what
the
odds
why
i
once
knew
an
old
chap
who
could
only
play
one
tune
on
the
clarionet
and
that
tune
out
of
all
tune
who
made
his
fortune
in
six
or
seven
streets
for
everyone
gave
him
money
and
told
him
to
go
away
when
he
found
out
that
he
came
every
morning
as
regular
as
now
there
was
one
of
the
streets
which
was
chiefly
occupied
by
music
sellers
and
italian
singers
for
them
foreigners
always
herd
together
and
this
tune
which
the
old
cow
died
of
as
the
saying
is
used
to
be
their
horror
and
out
came
the
halfpence
to
send
him
away
there
was
a
sort
of
club
also
in
that
street
of
larking
sort
of
young
men
and
when
they
perceived
that
the
others
gave
the
old
man
money
to
get
rid
of
his
squeaking
they
sent
him
out
money
with
orders
to
stay
and
play
to
them
so
then
the
others
sent
out
more
for
him
to
go
away
and
between
the
two
the
old
fellow
brought
home
more
money
than
all
the
cadgers
and
mumpers
in
the
district
now
if
you
have
a
loud
voice
i
can
provide
you
with
all
the
rest
you
gain
your
livelihood
by
that
be
sure
i
do
and
i
can
tell
you
that
of
all
the
trades
going
there
is
none
equal
to
it
you
see
my
hearty
i
have
been
on
board
of
a
not
that
i
a
sailor
or
was
ever
bred
to
the
sea
but
i
was
shipped
as
a
landsman
and
did
duty
in
the
waist
and
afterguard
i
know
little
or
nothing
of
my
duty
as
a
seaman
nor
was
it
required
in
the
station
i
was
in
so
i
never
learnt
although
i
was
four
years
on
board
all
i
learnt
was
the
lingo
and
slang
and
that
you
must
contrive
to
learn
from
me
i
bolted
and
made
my
way
good
to
lunnun
but
i
should
soon
have
been
picked
up
and
put
on
board
the
tender
again
if
i
had
got
this
wooden
stump
made
which
i
now
carry
in
my
hand
i
had
plenty
of
songs
and
i
commenced
my
profession
and
a
real
good
it
is
i
can
tell
you
why
do
you
know
that
a
good
victory
i
have
sometimes
picked
up
as
much
as
two
pounds
a
day
for
weeks
running
as
it
is
i
averages
from
fifteen
shillings
to
a
pound
now
as
you
helped
me
away
from
that
land
shark
who
would
soon
have
found
out
that
i
had
two
legs
and
have
put
me
into
limbo
as
an
impostor
i
will
teach
you
to
arn
your
livelihood
after
my
fashion
you
shall
work
with
me
until
you
are
fit
to
start
alone
and
then
there
plenty
of
room
in
england
for
both
of
us
but
mind
never
tell
anyone
what
you
pick
up
or
every
mumper
in
the
island
will
put
on
a
suit
of
sailor
clothes
and
the
thing
will
be
blown
upon
of
course
this
was
too
good
an
offer
to
be
rejected
and
i
joyfully
acceded
at
first
i
worked
with
him
as
having
only
one
arm
the
other
being
tied
down
to
my
side
and
my
jacket
sleeve
hanging
loose
and
empty
and
we
roared
away
right
and
left
so
as
to
bring
down
a
shower
of
coppers
wherever
we
went
in
about
three
weeks
my
friend
thought
i
was
able
to
start
by
myself
and
giving
me
half
of
the
ballads
and
five
shillings
to
start
with
i
shook
hands
and
parted
with
next
to
you
the
best
friend
that
i
certainly
ever
had
ever
since
i
have
been
crossing
the
country
in
every
direction
with
plenty
of
money
in
my
pocket
and
always
with
one
eye
looking
sharp
out
for
you
my
beautiful
voice
fortunately
attracted
your
attention
and
here
i
am
and
at
an
end
of
my
history
but
if
ever
i
am
away
from
you
and
in
distress
again
depend
upon
it
i
shall
take
to
my
wooden
leg
and
ballads
for
my
support
such
were
the
adventures
of
timothy
who
was
metamorphosed
into
a
precise
quaker
i
do
not
like
the
idea
of
your
taking
up
a
system
of
deceit
timothy
it
may
so
happen
for
who
knows
what
may
occur
that
you
may
again
be
thrown
upon
your
own
resources
now
would
it
not
be
better
that
you
should
obtain
a
more
intimate
knowledge
of
the
profession
which
we
are
now
in
which
is
liberal
and
equally
profitable
by
attention
and
study
you
will
be
able
to
dispense
medicines
and
make
up
prescriptions
as
well
as
myself
and
who
knows
but
that
some
day
you
may
be
the
owner
of
a
shop
like
this
verily
verily
thy
words
do
savour
of
much
wisdom
replied
tim
in
a
grave
voice
and
i
will
even
so
follow
thy
advice
part
three
chapter
fifteen
i
am
unsettled
by
unexpected
intelligence
and
again
yearn
after
the
world
of
fashion
i
knew
that
he
was
mocking
me
in
this
reply
but
i
paid
no
attention
to
that
i
was
satisfied
that
he
consented
i
now
made
him
assist
me
and
under
my
directions
he
made
up
the
prescriptions
i
explained
to
him
the
nature
of
every
medicine
and
i
made
him
read
many
books
of
physic
and
surgery
in
short
after
two
or
three
months
i
could
trust
to
timothy
as
well
as
if
i
were
in
the
shop
myself
and
having
an
errand
boy
i
had
much
more
leisure
and
i
left
him
in
charge
after
dinner
the
business
prospered
and
i
was
laying
up
money
my
leisure
time
i
hardly
need
say
was
spent
with
mr
cophagus
and
his
family
and
my
attachment
to
susannah
temple
increased
every
day
indeed
both
mr
and
mrs
cophagus
considered
that
it
was
to
be
a
match
and
often
joked
with
me
when
susannah
was
not
present
with
respect
to
susannah
i
could
not
perceive
that
i
was
farther
advanced
in
her
affections
than
after
i
had
known
her
two
months
she
was
always
kind
and
considerate
evidently
interested
in
my
welfare
always
checking
in
me
anything
like
levity
frank
and
confiding
in
her
opinions
and
charitable
to
all
as
i
thought
except
to
me
but
i
made
no
advance
that
i
could
perceive
the
fact
was
that
i
dared
not
speak
to
her
as
i
might
have
done
to
another
who
was
not
so
perfect
and
yet
she
smiled
as
i
thought
more
kindly
when
i
returned
than
at
other
times
and
never
appeared
to
be
tired
of
my
company
if
i
did
sometimes
mention
the
marriage
of
another
or
attentions
paid
which
would
in
all
probability
end
in
marriage
it
would
create
no
confusion
or
blushing
on
her
part
she
would
talk
over
that
subject
as
composedly
as
any
other
i
was
puzzled
and
i
had
been
a
year
and
nine
months
constantly
in
her
company
and
had
never
dared
to
tell
her
that
i
loved
her
but
one
day
mr
cophagus
brought
up
the
subject
when
we
were
alone
he
commenced
by
stating
how
happy
he
had
been
as
a
married
man
that
he
had
given
up
all
hopes
of
a
family
and
that
he
should
like
to
see
susannah
temple
his
well
married
that
he
might
leave
his
property
to
her
children
and
then
he
put
the
very
pertinent
question
japhet
verily
thou
hast
done
well
good
business
money
coming
in
fast
settle
japhet
marry
have
children
and
so
on
susannah
nice
girl
good
wife
pop
question
all
right
sly
puss
wo
say
no
um
what
d
say
and
so
on
i
replied
that
i
was
very
much
attached
to
susannah
but
that
i
was
afraid
that
the
attachment
was
not
mutual
and
therefore
hesitated
to
propose
cophagus
then
said
that
he
would
make
his
wife
sound
his
sister
and
let
me
know
the
result
this
was
in
the
morning
just
before
i
was
about
to
walk
over
to
the
shop
and
i
left
the
house
in
a
state
of
anxiety
and
suspense
when
i
arrived
at
the
shop
i
found
tim
there
as
usual
but
the
colour
in
his
face
was
heightened
as
he
said
to
me
read
this
japhet
and
handed
to
me
the
reading
mercury
i
read
an
advertisement
as
follows
if
japhet
newland
who
was
left
at
the
foundling
asylum
and
was
afterwards
for
some
time
in
london
will
call
at
number
throgmorton
court
minories
he
will
hear
of
something
very
much
to
his
advantage
and
will
discover
that
of
which
he
has
been
so
long
in
search
should
this
reach
his
eye
he
is
requested
to
write
immediately
to
the
above
address
with
full
particulars
of
his
situation
should
anyone
who
reads
this
be
able
to
give
any
information
relative
to
the
said
he
will
be
liberally
rewarded
i
sank
down
on
the
chair
merciful
heaven
this
can
be
no
mistake
will
discover
the
object
of
his
search
timothy
my
dear
timothy
i
have
at
last
found
out
my
father
so
i
should
imagine
my
dear
japhet
replied
timothy
and
i
trust
it
will
not
prove
a
disappointment
they
never
would
be
so
cruel
timothy
replied
i
but
still
it
is
evident
that
mr
masterton
is
concerned
in
it
observed
timothy
why
so
inquired
i
how
otherwise
should
it
appear
in
the
reading
newspaper
he
must
have
examined
the
of
my
letter
to
explain
this
i
must
remind
the
reader
that
timothy
had
promised
to
write
to
mr
masterton
when
he
found
me
and
he
requested
my
permission
shortly
after
we
had
met
again
i
consented
to
his
keeping
his
word
but
restricted
him
to
saying
any
more
than
that
he
had
found
me
and
that
i
was
well
and
happy
there
was
no
address
in
the
letter
as
a
clue
to
mr
masterton
as
to
where
i
might
be
and
it
could
only
have
been
from
the
that
he
could
have
formed
any
idea
surmise
was
therefore
very
probable
but
i
would
not
believe
that
mr
masterton
would
consent
to
the
insertion
of
that
portion
of
the
advertisement
if
there
was
no
foundation
for
it
what
will
you
do
japhet
do
replied
i
recovering
from
my
reverie
for
the
information
had
again
roused
up
all
my
dormant
feelings
do
replied
i
why
i
shall
set
off
for
town
this
very
morning
in
that
dress
japhet
i
suppose
i
must
replied
i
for
i
have
no
time
to
procure
another
and
all
my
former
ideas
of
fashion
and
appearance
were
roused
and
in
full
activity
my
pride
recovered
its
ascendency
well
replied
timothy
i
hope
you
will
find
your
father
all
that
you
could
wish
i
sure
of
it
tim
i
sure
of
it
replied
i
you
must
run
and
take
a
place
in
the
first
coach
but
you
are
not
going
without
seeing
mr
and
mrs
cophagus
and
miss
temple
continued
tim
laying
an
emphasis
upon
the
latter
name
of
course
not
replied
i
colouring
deeply
i
will
go
at
once
give
me
the
newspaper
tim
i
took
the
newspaper
and
hastened
to
the
house
of
mr
cophagus
i
found
them
all
three
sitting
in
the
breakfast
parlour
mr
cophagus
as
usual
reading
with
his
spectacles
on
his
nose
and
the
ladies
at
work
what
is
the
matter
friend
japhet
exclaimed
mr
cophagus
as
i
burst
into
the
room
my
countenance
lighted
up
with
excitement
read
that
sir
said
i
to
mr
cophagus
mr
cophagus
read
it
hum
bad
news
lose
japhet
man
of
fashion
and
so
on
said
cophagus
pointing
out
the
paragraph
to
his
wife
as
he
handed
over
the
paper
in
the
mean
time
i
watched
the
countenance
of
susannah
a
slight
emotion
but
instantly
checked
was
visible
at
mr
cophagus
remark
she
then
remained
quiet
until
her
sister
who
had
read
the
paragraph
handed
the
paper
to
her
i
give
thee
joy
japhet
at
the
prospect
of
finding
out
thy
parent
said
mrs
cophagus
i
trust
thou
wilt
find
in
him
one
who
is
to
be
esteemed
as
a
man
when
departest
thou
immediately
replied
i
i
can
not
blame
thee
the
ties
of
nature
are
ever
powerful
i
trust
that
thou
wilt
write
to
us
and
that
we
soon
shall
see
thee
return
yes
yes
said
cophagus
see
father
shake
hands
come
back
heh

here
and
so
on
i
shall
not
be
altogether
my
own
master
perhaps
observed
i
if
my
father
desires
that
i
remain
with
him
must
not
i
obey
but
i
know
nothing
at
present
you
shall
hear
from
me
timothy
can
take
my
place
in
the
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
the
word
shop
and
i
stopped
susannah
for
the
first
time
looked
me
earnestly
in
the
face
but
she
said
nothing
mr
and
mrs
cophagus
who
probably
had
been
talking
over
the
subject
of
our
conversation
and
thought
this
a
good
opportunity
to
allow
me
to
have
an
with
susannah
left
the
room
saying
they
would
look
after
my
portmanteau
and
linen
susannah
said
i
you
do
not
appear
to
rejoice
with
me
japhet
newland
i
will
rejoice
at
everything
that
may
tend
to
thy
happiness
believe
me
but
i
do
not
feel
assured
but
that
this
trial
may
prove
too
great
and
that
thou
mayst
fall
away
indeed
i
perceive
even
now
that
thou
art
excited
with
new
ideas
and
visions
of
pride
if
i
am
wrong
forgive
me
susannah
you
must
know
that
the
whole
object
of
my
existence
has
been
to
find
my
father
and
now
that
i
have
every
reason
to
suppose
that
my
wish
is
obtained
can
you
be
surprised
or
can
you
blame
me
that
i
long
to
be
pressed
in
his
arms
nay
japhet
for
that
filial
feeling
i
do
commend
thee
but
ask
thy
own
heart
is
that
the
only
feeling
which
now
exciteth
thee
dost
thou
not
expect
to
find
thy
father
one
high
in
rank
and
power
dost
thou
not
anticipate
to
join
once
more
the
world
which
thou
hast
quitted
yet
still
hast
sighed
for
dost
thou
not
already
feel
contempt
for
thy
honest
profession
nay
more
dost
thou
not
only
long
to
cast
off
the
plain
attire
and
not
only
the
attire
but
the
sect
which
in
thy
adversity
thou
didst
embrace
the
tenets
of
ask
thy
own
heart
and
reply
if
thou
wilt
but
i
press
thee
not
so
to
do
for
the
truth
would
be
painful
and
a
lie
thou
knowest
i
do
utterly
abhor
i
felt
that
susannah
spoke
the
truth
and
i
would
not
deny
it
i
sat
down
by
her
susannah
said
i
it
is
not
very
easy
to
change
at
once
i
have
mixed
for
years
in
the
world
with
you
i
have
not
yet
lived
two
i
will
not
deny
but
that
the
feelings
you
have
expressed
have
risen
in
my
heart
but
i
will
try
to
repress
them
at
least
for
your
sake
susannah
i
would
try
to
repress
them
for
i
value
your
opinion
more
than
that
of
the
whole
world
you
have
the
power
to
do
with
me
as
you
please
will
you
exert
that
power
japhet
replied
susannah
the
faith
which
is
not
built
upon
a
more
solid
foundation
than
to
win
the
favour
of
an
erring
being
like
myself
is
but
weak
that
power
over
thee
which
thou
expectest
will
fix
thee
in
the
right
path
may
soon
be
lost
and
what
is
then
to
direct
thee
if
no
purer
motives
than
earthly
affection
are
to
be
thy
stay
most
surely
thou
wilt
fall
but
no
more
of
this
thou
hast
a
duty
to
perform
which
is
to
go
to
thy
earthly
father
and
seek
his
blessing
nay
more
i
would
that
thou
shouldst
once
more
enter
into
the
world
there
thou
mayst
decide
shouldst
thou
return
to
us
thy
friends
will
rejoice
and
not
one
of
them
will
be
more
joyful
than
susannah
temple
fare
thee
well
japhet
mayst
thou
prove
superior
to
temptation
i
will
pray
for
thee
earnestly
i
will
pray
for
thee
japhet
continued
susannah
with
a
quivering
of
her
lips
and
broken
voice
and
she
left
the
room
part
three
chapter
sixteen
i
return
to
london
and
meet
with
mr
masterton
i
went
up
stairs
and
found
that
all
was
ready
and
i
took
leave
of
mr
and
mrs
cophagus
both
of
whom
expressed
their
hopes
that
i
would
not
leave
them
for
ever
oh
no
replied
i
i
should
indeed
be
base
if
i
did
i
left
them
and
with
ephraim
following
with
my
portmanteau
i
quitted
the
house
i
had
gone
about
twenty
yards
when
i
recollected
that
i
had
left
on
the
table
the
newspaper
with
the
advertisement
containing
the
direction
whom
to
apply
to
and
desiring
ephraim
to
proceed
i
returned
when
i
entered
the
parlour
susannah
temple
was
resting
her
face
in
her
hands
and
weeping
the
opening
of
the
door
made
her
start
up
she
perceived
that
it
was
i
and
she
turned
away
i
beg
your
pardon
i
left
the
newspaper
said
i
stammering
i
was
about
to
throw
myself
at
her
feet
declare
my
sincere
affection
and
give
up
all
idea
of
finding
my
father
until
we
were
married
when
she
without
saying
a
word
passed
quickly
by
me
and
hastened
out
of
the
room
she
loves
me
then
thought
i
thank
god
i
will
not
go
yet
i
will
speak
to
her
first
i
sat
down
quite
overpowered
with
contending
feelings
the
paper
was
in
my
hand
the
paragraph
was
again
read
i
thought
but
of
my
father
and
i
left
the
house
in
half
an
hour
i
had
shaken
hands
with
timothy
and
quitted
the
town
of
reading
how
i
arrived
in
london
that
is
to
say
what
passed
or
what
we
passed
i
know
not
my
mind
was
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
i
hardly
know
how
to
express
the
state
that
i
was
in
it
was
a
sort
of
mental
whirling
which
blinded
me
round
and
round
from
my
father
and
the
expected
meeting
then
to
susannah
my
departure
and
her
tears
castle
building
of
every
description
after
the
coach
stopped
there
i
remained
fixed
on
the
top
of
it
not
aware
that
we
were
in
london
until
the
coachman
asked
me
whether
the
spirit
did
not
move
me
to
get
down
i
recollected
myself
and
calling
a
gave
orders
to
be
driven
to
the
piazza
covent
garden
piazza
common
garden
said
the
waterman
why
that
ba
an
for
the
like
o
you
master
they
torment
you
to
death
them
young
chaps
i
had
forgotten
that
i
was
dressed
as
a
quaker
tell
the
coachman
to
stop
at
the
first
cloth
warehouse
where
they
have
cloaks
said
i
the
man
did
so
i
went
out
and
purchased
a
roquelaure
which
enveloped
my
whole
person
i
then
stopped
at
a
hatter
and
purchased
a
hat
according
to
the
mode
now
drive
to
the
piazza
said
i
entering
the
coach
i
know
not
why
but
i
was
resolved
to
go
to
that
hotel
it
was
the
one
i
had
stayed
at
when
i
first
arrived
in
london
and
i
wished
to
see
it
again
when
the
stopped
i
asked
the
waiter
who
came
out
whether
he
had
apartments
and
answering
me
in
the
affirmative
i
followed
him
and
was
shown
into
the
same
rooms
i
had
previously
occupied
these
will
do
said
i
now
let
me
have
something
to
eat
and
send
for
a
good
tailor
the
waiter
offered
to
remove
my
cloak
but
i
refused
saying
that
i
was
cold
he
left
the
room
and
i
threw
myself
on
the
sofa
running
over
all
the
scenes
which
had
passed
in
that
room
with
carbonnell
harcourt
and
others
my
thoughts
were
broken
in
upon
by
the
arrival
of
the
tailor
stop
a
moment
said
i
and
let
him
come
in
when
i
ring
so
ashamed
was
i
of
my
quaker
dress
that
i
threw
off
my
coat
and
waistcoat
and
put
on
my
cloak
again
before
i
rang
the
bell
for
the
tailor
to
come
up
mr
said
i
i
must
have
a
suit
of
clothes
ready
by
at
ten
impossible
sir
impossible
said
i
and
you
pretend
to
be
a
fashionable
tailor
leave
the
room
at
this
peremptory
behaviour
the
tailor
imagined
that
i
must
be
somebody
i
will
do
my
possible
sir
and
if
i
can
only
get
home
in
time
to
stop
the
workmen
i
think
it
may
be
managed
of
course
you
are
aware
of
the
expense
of
night
work
i
am
only
aware
of
this
that
if
i
give
an
order
i
am
accustomed
to
have
it
obeyed
i
learnt
that
from
my
poor
friend
major
carbonnell
the
tailor
bowed
low
there
was
magic
in
the
name
although
the
man
was
dead
here
have
i
been
masquerading
in
a
quaker
dress
to
please
a
puritanical
young
lady
and
i
am
obliged
to
be
off
without
any
other
clothes
in
my
portmanteau
so
take
my
measure
and
i
expect
the
clothes
at
ten
precisely
so
saying
i
threw
off
my
roquelaure
and
desired
him
to
proceed
this
accomplished
the
tradesman
took
his
leave
shortly
afterwards
the
door
opened
and
as
i
lay
wrapped
up
in
my
cloak
on
the
sofa
in
came
the
landlord
and
two
waiters
each
bearing
a
dish
of
my
supper
i
wished
them
at
the
devil
but
i
was
still
more
surprised
when
the
landlord
made
a
low
bow
saying
happy
to
see
you
returned
mr
newland
you
been
away
some
time
another
grand
tour
i
presume
yes
mr
i
have
had
a
few
adventures
since
i
was
last
here
replied
i
carelessly
but
i
am
not
very
well
you
may
leave
the
supper
and
if
i
feel
inclined
i
will
take
a
little
no
one
need
wait
the
landlord
and
waiter
bowed
and
went
out
of
the
room
i
turned
the
key
of
the
door
put
on
my
quaker
coat
and
made
a
hearty
supper
for
i
had
had
nothing
since
breakfast
when
i
had
finished
i
returned
to
the
sofa
and
i
could
not
help
analysing
my
own
conduct
alas
thought
i
susannah
how
rightly
did
you
judge
me
i
am
not
away
from
you
more
than
eighteen
hours
and
here
i
am
ashamed
of
the
dress
which
i
have
so
long
worn
and
been
satisfied
with
in
your
society
truly
did
you
say
that
i
was
full
of
pride
and
would
joyfully
the
world
of
vanity
and
vexation
and
i
thought
of
susannah
and
her
tears
after
my
supposed
departure
and
i
felt
angry
and
annoyed
at
my
want
of
strength
of
mind
and
my
worldly
feelings
i
retired
early
to
bed
and
did
not
wake
until
late
the
next
morning
when
i
rang
the
bell
the
chambermaid
brought
in
my
clothes
from
the
tailor
i
dressed
and
i
will
not
deny
that
i
was
pleased
with
the
alteration
after
breakfast
i
ordered
a
coach
and
drove
to
number
throgmorton
court
minories
the
house
was
dirty
outside
and
the
windows
had
not
been
cleaned
apparently
for
years
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
when
i
went
in
that
i
could
decypher
a
tall
man
seated
at
the
desk
your
pleasure
sir
said
he
am
i
speaking
to
the
principal
replied
i
yes
sir
my
name
is
chatfield
i
come
to
you
sir
relative
to
an
advertisement
which
appeared
in
the
papers
i
refer
to
this
continued
i
putting
the
newspaper
down
on
the
desk
and
pointing
to
the
advertisement
oh
yes
very
true
can
you
give
us
any
information
yes
sir
i
can
and
the
most
satisfactory
then
sir
i
am
sorry
that
you
have
had
so
much
trouble
but
you
must
call
at
lincoln
inn
upon
a
lawyer
of
the
name
of
masterton
the
whole
affair
is
now
in
his
hands
can
you
sir
inform
me
who
is
the
party
that
is
inquiring
after
this
young
man
why
yes
it
is
a
general
de
benyon
who
has
lately
returned
from
the
east
indies
good
god
is
it
possible
thought
i
how
strange
that
my
own
wild
fancy
should
have
settled
upon
him
as
my
father
i
hurried
away
threw
myself
into
the
and
desired
the
man
to
drive
to
lincoln
inn
i
hastened
up
to
mr
masterton
rooms
he
was
fortunately
at
home
although
he
stood
at
the
table
with
his
hat
and
his
great
coat
on
ready
to
go
out
my
dear
sir
have
you
forgotten
me
said
i
in
a
voice
choked
with
emotion
taking
his
hand
and
squeezing
it
with
rapture
by
heavens
you
are
determined
that
i
shall
not
forget
you
for
some
minutes
at
least
exclaimed
he
wringing
his
hand
with
pain
who
the
devil
are
you
mr
masterton
could
not
see
without
his
spectacles
and
my
subdued
voice
he
had
not
recognised
he
pulled
them
out
as
i
made
no
reply
and
fixing
them
across
his
nose
hah
why
yes
it
is
japhet
is
it
not
it
is
indeed
sir
said
i
again
offering
my
hand
which
he
shook
warmly
not
quite
so
hard
my
dear
fellow
this
time
said
the
old
lawyer
i
acknowledge
your
vigour
and
that
is
sufficient
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
japhet
i
am
indeed
you
you
scamp
you
ungrateful
fellow
sit
down
sit
down
first
help
me
off
with
my
great
coat
i
presume
the
advertisement
has
brought
you
into
existence
again
well
it
all
true
and
you
have
at
last
found
your
father
or
rather
he
has
found
you
and
what
more
strange
you
hit
upon
the
right
person
that
is
strange
very
strange
indeed
where
is
he
sir
interrupted
i
where
is
he
take
me
to
him
no
rather
be
excused
replied
mr
masterton
for
he
is
gone
to
ireland
so
you
must
wait
wait
sir
oh
no
i
must
follow
him
that
will
only
do
harm
for
he
is
rather
a
queer
sort
of
an
old
gentleman
and
although
he
acknowledges
that
he
left
you
as
and
has
searched
for
you
yet
he
is
so
afraid
of
somebody
else
brat
being
put
upon
him
that
he
insists
upon
most
undeniable
proofs
now
we
can
not
trace
you
from
the
hospital
unless
we
can
find
that
fellow
cophagus
and
we
have
made
every
search
after
him
and
no
one
can
tell
where
he
is
but
i
left
him
but
yesterday
morning
sir
replied
i
good
very
good
we
must
send
for
him
or
go
to
him
besides
he
has
the
packet
intrusted
to
the
care
of
miss
maitland
to
whom
he
was
executor
which
proves
the
marriage
of
your
father
very
strange
very
strange
indeed
that
you
should
have
hit
upon
it
as
you
did
almost
supernatural
however
all
right
now
my
dear
boy
and
i
congratulate
you
your
father
is
a
very
strange
person
he
has
lived
like
a
despot
among
slaves
all
his
life
and
will
not
be
thwarted
i
can
tell
you
if
you
say
a
word
in
contradiction
he
disinherit
you
terrible
old
tiger
i
must
say
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
sake
i
should
have
done
with
him
long
ago
he
seems
to
think
the
world
ought
to
be
at
his
feet
depend
upon
it
japhet
there
is
no
hurry
about
seeing
him
and
see
him
you
shall
not
until
we
have
every
proof
of
your
identity
ready
to
produce
to
him
i
hope
you
have
the
bump
of
veneration
strong
japhet
and
plenty
of
filial
duty
or
you
will
be
kicked
out
of
the
house
in
a
week
damn
me
if
he
did
call
me
an
old
thief
of
a
lawyer
indeed
sir
replied
i
laughing
i
must
apologise
to
you
for
my
father
conduct
never
mind
japhet
i
do
care
about
a
trifle
but
why
do
you
ask
after
your
friends
i
have
longed
so
to
do
sir
replied
i
lord
windermear
is
quite
well
and
will
be
most
happy
to
see
you
lady
de
clare
and
her
daughter
lady
de
clare
has
entered
into
society
again
and
her
daughter
as
you
call
her
your
fleta
cecilia
de
clare
is
the
belle
of
the
metropolis
but
now
sir
as
i
have
answered
all
your
interrogatories
and
satisfied
you
upon
the
most
essential
points
will
you
favour
me
with
a
narrative
of
your
adventures
for
adventures
i
am
sure
you
must
have
had
since
you
ran
away
from
us
all
in
that
ungrateful
manner
most
certainly
sir
i
will
and
as
you
say
i
have
had
adventures
but
it
really
will
be
a
long
story
then
we
dine
here
and
pass
the
evening
together
so
settled
part
three
chapter
seventeen
in
which
i
am
let
into
more
particulars
relative
to
my
father
history
i
dismissed
the
coach
while
mr
masterton
gave
his
orders
for
dinner
and
we
then
turned
the
key
of
the
door
to
avoid
intrusion
and
i
commenced
it
was
nearly
before
i
had
finished
my
story
well
you
really
appear
to
be
born
for
getting
into
scrapes
and
getting
out
of
them
again
in
a
miraculous
way
observed
mr
masterton
your
life
would
make
a
novel
it
would
indeed
sir
replied
i
i
only
hope
like
all
novels
it
will
wind
up
well
so
do
i
but
dinner
ready
japhet
and
after
dinner
we
talk
the
matter
over
again
for
there
are
some
points
upon
which
i
require
some
explanation
we
sat
down
to
dinner
and
when
we
had
finished
and
the
table
had
been
cleared
we
drew
to
the
fire
with
our
bottle
of
wine
mr
masterton
stirred
the
fire
called
for
his
slippers
and
then
crossing
his
legs
over
the
fender
resumed
the
subject
japhet
i
consider
it
most
fortunate
that
we
have
met
previous
to
your
introduction
to
your
father
you
have
so
far
to
congratulate
yourself
that
your
family
is
undeniably
good
there
being
as
you
know
an
irish
peerage
in
it
of
which
however
you
have
no
chance
as
the
present
earl
has
a
numerous
offspring
you
are
also
fortunate
as
far
as
money
is
concerned
as
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
your
father
is
a
very
rich
man
and
of
course
you
are
his
only
child
but
i
must
now
prepare
you
to
meet
with
a
very
different
person
than
perhaps
the
fond
anticipations
of
youth
may
have
led
you
to
expect
your
father
has
no
paternal
feelings
that
i
can
discover
he
has
wealth
and
he
wishes
to
leave
it
he
has
therefore
sought
you
out
but
he
is
despotic
violent
and
absurd
the
least
opposition
to
his
will
makes
him
furious
and
i
am
sorry
to
add
that
i
am
afraid
that
he
is
very
mean
he
suffered
severely
when
young
from
poverty
and
his
own
father
was
almost
as
authoritative
and
unforgiving
as
himself
and
now
i
will
state
how
it
was
that
you
were
left
at
the
asylum
when
an
infant
your
grandfather
had
procured
for
your
father
a
commission
in
the
army
and
soon
afterwards
procured
him
a
lieutenancy
he
ordered
him
to
marry
a
young
lady
of
large
fortune
whom
he
had
never
seen
and
sent
for
him
for
that
purpose
i
understand
that
she
was
very
beautiful
and
had
your
father
seen
her
it
is
probable
he
would
have
made
no
objection
but
he
very
foolishly
sent
a
peremptory
refusal
for
which
he
was
dismissed
for
ever
in
a
short
time
afterwards
your
father
fell
in
love
with
a
young
lady
of
great
personal
attractions
and
supposed
to
possess
a
large
fortune
to
deceive
her
he
pretended
to
be
the
heir
to
the
earldom
and
after
a
hasty
courtship
they
ran
off
and
were
married
when
they
compared
notes
which
they
soon
did
it
was
discovered
that
on
his
side
he
had
nothing
but
the
pay
of
a
subaltern
and
on
hers
that
she
had
not
one
shilling
your
father
stormed
and
called
his
wife
an
impostor
she
recriminated
and
the
second
morning
after
the
marriage
was
passed
in
tears
on
her
side
and
oaths
curses
and
revilings
on
his
the
lady
however
appeared
the
more
sensible
party
of
the
two
their
marriage
was
not
known
she
had
run
away
on
a
pretence
to
visit
a
relative
and
it
was
actually
supposed
in
the
county
town
where
she
resided
that
such
was
the
case
should
we
quarrel
in
this
way
observed
she
edmund
wished
to
marry
a
fortune
and
not
me
i
may
plead
guilty
to
the
same
duplicity
we
have
made
a
mistake
but
it
is
not
too
late
it
is
supposed
that
i
am
on
a
visit
to
and
that
you
are
on
furlough
for
a
few
days
did
you
confide
your
secret
to
any
of
your
brother
officers
one
muttered
your
father
then
let
us
part
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
nobody
will
be
the
wiser
we
are
equally
interested
in
keeping
the
secret
is
it
agreed
your
father
immediately
consented
he
accompanied
your
mother
to
the
house
at
where
she
was
expected
and
she
framed
a
story
for
her
delay
by
having
met
such
a
very
polite
young
man
your
father
returned
to
his
regiment
and
thus
did
they
like
two
privateers
who
when
they
meet
and
engage
as
soon
as
they
find
out
their
mistake
hoist
their
colours
and
sheer
off
by
mutual
consent
i
ca
say
much
for
my
mother
affection
or
delicacy
observed
i
the
less
you
say
the
better
japhet
however
that
is
your
story
and
how
to
proceed
it
appears
that
about
two
months
afterwards
your
father
received
a
letter
from
your
mother
acquainting
him
that
their
short
intercourse
had
been
productive
of
certain
results
and
requesting
that
he
would
take
the
necessary
steps
to
provide
for
the
child
and
avoid
exposure
or
that
she
would
be
obliged
to
confess
her
marriage
by
what
means
they
contrived
to
avoid
exposure
until
the
period
of
her
confinement
i
know
not
but
your
father
states
that
the
child
was
born
in
a
house
in
london
and
by
agreement
was
instantly
put
into
his
hands
that
he
with
the
consent
of
his
wife
left
you
at
the
door
of
the
asylum
with
the
paper
and
the
bank
note
from
which
you
received
the
name
of
newland
at
the
time
he
had
no
idea
of
reclaiming
you
himself
but
the
mother
had
for
heartless
as
she
appears
to
have
been
yet
a
mother
must
feel
for
her
child
your
father
regiment
was
then
ordered
out
to
the
east
indies
and
he
was
rapidly
promoted
for
his
gallantry
and
good
conduct
during
the
war
in
the
mysore
territory
once
only
has
he
returned
home
on
furlough
and
then
he
did
make
inquiries
after
you
not
it
appears
with
a
view
of
finding
you
out
on
his
own
account
but
from
a
promise
which
he
made
your
mother
my
mother
what
have
they
met
since
yes
your
mother
went
out
to
india
on
speculation
passing
off
as
a
single
girl
and
was
very
well
married
there
i
was
going
to
say
however
she
committed
a
very
splendid
bigamy
good
heavens
how
totally
destitute
of
principle
your
father
asserts
that
your
mother
was
a
freethinker
japhet
her
father
had
made
her
one
without
religion
a
woman
has
no
stay
your
father
was
in
the
up
country
during
the
time
that
your
mother
arrived
and
was
married
to
one
of
the
council
of
calcutta
your
father
says
that
they
met
at
a
ball
at
government
house
she
was
still
a
very
handsome
woman
and
much
admired
when
your
father
recognised
her
and
was
told
that
she
was
lately
married
to
the
honourable
mr
he
was
quite
electrified
and
would
have
quitted
the
room
but
she
had
perceived
him
and
walking
up
to
him
with
the
greatest
coolness
claimed
him
as
an
old
acquaintance
in
england
and
afterwards
they
often
met
but
she
never
adverted
to
what
had
passed
between
them
until
the
time
for
his
departure
to
england
on
leave
and
she
then
sent
for
him
and
begged
that
he
would
make
some
inquiries
after
you
japhet
he
did
so
and
you
know
the
result
on
his
return
to
india
he
found
that
your
mother
had
been
carried
off
by
the
prevailing
pestilence
at
that
period
your
father
was
not
rich
but
he
was
then
appointed
to
the
chief
command
in
the
carnatic
and
reaped
a
golden
harvest
in
return
for
his
success
and
bravery
it
appears
as
far
as
i
could
obtain
it
from
him
that
as
long
as
your
mother
was
alive
he
felt
no
interest
about
you
but
her
death
and
the
subsequent
wealth
which
poured
upon
him
have
now
induced
him
to
find
out
an
heir
to
whom
it
may
be
bequeathed
such
japhet
are
the
outlines
of
your
father
history
and
i
must
point
out
that
he
has
no
feelings
of
affection
for
you
at
present
the
conduct
of
your
mother
is
ever
before
him
and
if
it
were
not
that
he
wishes
an
heir
i
should
almost
say
that
his
feelings
are
those
of
dislike
you
may
create
an
interest
in
his
heart
it
is
true
and
he
may
be
gratified
by
your
personal
appearance
but
you
will
have
a
very
difficult
task
as
you
will
have
to
submit
to
his
caprices
and
fancies
and
i
am
afraid
that
to
a
high
spirit
like
yours
they
will
be
almost
unbearable
really
sir
i
begin
to
feel
that
the
fondest
anticipations
are
seldom
realised
and
almost
to
wish
that
i
had
not
been
sought
for
by
my
father
i
was
happy
and
contented
and
now
i
do
not
see
any
chance
of
having
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
change
on
one
or
two
points
i
also
wish
to
question
you
it
appears
that
you
have
entered
into
the
sect
denominated
quakers
tell
me
candidly
do
you
subscribe
heartily
and
sincerely
to
their
doctrines
and
i
was
going
to
add
is
it
your
intention
to
remain
with
them
i
perceive
much
difficulty
in
all
this
the
tenets
of
the
sect
i
certainly
do
believe
to
be
more
in
accordance
with
the
christian
religion
than
any
other
and
i
have
no
hesitation
in
asserting
from
my
knowledge
of
those
who
belong
to
this
sect
that
they
generally
speaking
lead
better
lives
there
are
some
points
connected
with
their
worship
which
at
first
i
considered
ridiculous
the
feeling
has
however
worn
off
as
to
their
quaint
manner
of
speaking
that
has
been
grossly
exaggerated
their
dress
is
a
part
of
their
religion
why
so
japhet
i
can
reply
to
you
in
the
words
of
susannah
temple
when
i
made
the
same
interrogatory
think
the
peculiarity
of
our
dress
is
an
outward
form
which
is
not
required
it
was
put
on
to
separate
us
from
others
and
as
a
proof
of
our
sincerity
but
still
the
discarding
of
the
dress
is
a
proof
of
sincerity
we
consider
that
to
admire
the
person
is
vain
and
our
creed
is
humility
it
is
therefore
an
outward
and
visible
sign
that
we
would
act
up
to
those
tenets
which
we
profess
it
is
not
all
who
wear
the
dress
who
are
quakers
in
heart
or
conduct
but
we
know
that
when
it
is
put
aside
the
tenets
of
our
persuasion
are
at
the
same
time
renounced
therefore
do
we
consider
it
essential
i
do
not
mean
to
say
but
that
the
heart
may
be
as
pure
and
the
faith
continue
as
steadfast
without
such
signs
outwardly
but
it
is
a
part
of
our
creed
and
we
must
not
choose
but
either
reject
all
or
none
very
well
argued
by
the
little
quakeress
and
now
japhet
i
should
like
to
put
another
question
to
you
are
you
very
much
attached
to
this
young
puritan
i
will
not
deny
but
that
i
am
i
love
her
sincerely
does
your
love
carry
you
so
far
that
you
would
for
her
sake
continue
a
quaker
and
marry
her
i
have
asked
myself
that
question
at
least
a
hundred
times
during
the
last
hours
and
i
can
not
decide
if
she
would
dress
as
others
do
and
allow
me
to
do
the
same
i
would
marry
her
whether
i
shall
ever
make
up
my
mind
to
adhere
to
the
persuasion
and
live
and
die
a
quaker
for
her
sake
is
quite
another
matter
but
i
am
afraid
not
i
am
too
the
fact
is
i
am
in
a
very
awkward
position
with
respect
to
her
i
have
never
acknowledged
my
affection
or
asked
for
a
return
but
she
knows
i
love
her
and
i
know
that
she
loves
me
like
all
vain
boys
you
flatter
yourself
i
leave
you
to
judge
sir
replied
i
repeating
to
him
our
parting
and
how
i
had
returned
and
found
her
in
tears
all
that
certainly
is
very
corroborative
evidence
but
tell
me
japhet
do
you
think
she
loves
you
well
enough
to
abandon
all
for
your
sake
no
nor
ever
will
sir
she
is
too
too
she
might
suffer
greatly
but
she
never
would
swerve
from
what
she
thought
was
right
she
must
be
a
fine
character
japhet
but
you
will
be
in
a
dilemma
indeed
it
appears
to
me
that
your
troubles
are
now
commencing
instead
of
ending
and
that
you
would
have
been
much
happier
where
you
were
than
you
will
be
by
being
again
brought
out
into
the
world
your
prospect
is
not
you
have
an
awkward
father
to
deal
with
you
will
be
under
a
strong
check
i
a
notion
and
i
am
afraid
you
will
find
that
notwithstanding
you
will
be
once
more
received
into
society
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
i
am
afraid
you
are
right
sir
replied
i
but
at
all
events
it
will
be
something
gained
to
be
acknowledged
to
the
world
by
a
father
of
good
family
whatever
else
i
may
have
to
submit
to
i
have
been
the
sport
of
fortune
all
my
life
and
probably
she
has
not
yet
done
playing
with
me
but
it
is
late
and
i
will
now
wish
you
good
night
good
night
japhet
if
i
have
any
intelligence
i
will
let
you
know
lady
de
clare
address
is
number
park
street
you
will
of
course
go
there
as
soon
as
you
can
i
will
sir
after
i
have
written
my
letters
to
my
friends
at
reading
part
three
chapter
eighteen
i
am
a
little
jealous
and
like
the
immortal
william
bottom
inclined
to
enact
more
parts
than
one
with
a
big
effort
my
hankering
after
bigamy
is
mastered
by
mr
masterton
and
by
my
own
good
sense
i
returned
home
to
reflect
upon
what
mr
masterton
had
told
me
and
i
must
say
that
i
was
not
very
well
pleased
with
his
various
information
his
account
of
my
mother
although
she
was
no
more
distressed
me
and
from
the
character
which
he
gave
of
my
father
i
felt
convinced
that
my
happiness
would
not
be
at
all
increased
by
my
having
finally
attained
the
object
of
my
wishes
strange
to
say
i
had
no
sooner
discovered
my
father
but
i
wished
that
he
had
never
turned
up
and
when
i
compared
the
peaceful
and
happy
state
of
existence
which
i
had
lately
enjoyed
with
the
prospects
of
what
i
had
in
future
to
submit
to
i
bitterly
repented
that
the
advertisement
had
been
seen
by
timothy
still
on
one
point
i
was
peculiarly
anxious
without
hardly
daring
to
anatomise
my
feelings
it
was
relative
to
cecilia
de
clare
and
what
mr
masterton
had
mentioned
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
the
next
morning
i
wrote
to
timothy
and
to
mr
cophagus
giving
them
a
short
detail
of
what
i
had
been
informed
by
mr
masterton
and
expressing
a
wish
which
i
then
really
did
feel
that
i
had
never
been
summoned
away
from
them
having
finished
my
letters
i
set
off
to
park
street
to
call
upon
lady
de
clare
and
cecilia
it
was
rather
early
but
the
footman
who
opened
the
door
recognised
me
and
i
was
admitted
upon
his
own
responsibility
it
was
now
more
than
eighteen
months
since
i
had
quitted
their
house
at
richmond
and
i
was
very
anxious
to
know
what
reception
i
might
have
i
followed
the
servant
up
stairs
and
when
he
opened
the
door
walked
in
as
my
name
was
announced
lady
de
clare
rose
in
haste
so
did
cecilia
and
so
did
a
third
person
whom
i
had
not
expected
to
have
met
harcourt
mr
newland
exclaimed
lady
de
clare
this
is
indeed
unexpected
cecilia
also
came
forward
blushing
to
the
forehead
harcourt
held
back
as
if
waiting
for
the
advances
to
be
made
on
my
side
on
the
whole
i
never
felt
more
awkwardly
and
i
believe
my
feelings
were
reciprocated
by
the
whole
party
i
was
evidently
do
you
know
mr
harcourt
at
last
said
lady
de
clare
if
it
is
the
mr
harcourt
i
once
knew
replied
i
i
certainly
do
believe
me
it
is
the
same
newland
said
harcourt
turning
to
me
and
offering
his
hand
which
i
took
with
pleasure
it
is
a
long
while
since
we
met
observed
cecilia
who
felt
it
necessary
to
say
something
but
at
the
same
time
did
not
like
to
enter
upon
my
affairs
before
harcourt
it
is
miss
de
clare
replied
i
for
i
was
not
exactly
pleased
at
my
reception
but
i
have
been
fortunate
since
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
last
cecilia
and
her
mother
looked
earnestly
as
much
as
to
say
in
what
but
did
not
like
to
ask
the
question
there
is
no
one
present
who
is
not
well
acquainted
with
my
history
observed
i
that
is
until
the
time
that
i
left
you
and
lady
de
clare
and
i
have
no
wish
to
create
mystery
i
have
at
last
discovered
my
father
i
hope
we
are
to
congratulate
you
mr
newland
said
lady
de
clare
as
far
as
respectability
and
family
are
concerned
i
certainly
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
replied
i
he
is
the
brother
of
an
earl
and
a
general
in
the
army
his
name
i
will
not
mention
until
i
have
seen
him
and
i
am
formally
and
openly
acknowledged
i
have
also
the
advantage
of
being
an
only
son
and
if
i
am
not
disinherited
heir
to
considerable
property
continued
i
smiling
sarcastically
perhaps
i
may
now
be
better
than
i
have
been
as
japhet
newland
the
foundling
but
lady
de
clare
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
intruded
unseasonably
and
will
now
take
my
leave
good
morning
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
i
made
a
hasty
retreat
and
gained
the
door
flushed
with
indignation
i
had
nearly
gained
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
when
i
heard
a
light
footstep
behind
me
and
my
arm
was
caught
by
cecilia
de
clare
i
turned
round
and
she
looked
me
reproachfully
in
the
face
as
the
tear
stood
in
her
eye
what
have
we
done
japhet
that
you
should
treat
us
in
this
manner
said
she
with
emotion
miss
de
clare
replied
i
i
have
no
reproaches
to
make
i
perceived
that
my
presence
was
not
welcome
and
i
would
no
further
intrude
are
you
then
so
proud
now
that
you
have
found
out
that
you
are
well
born
japhet
i
am
much
too
proud
to
intrude
where
i
am
not
wished
for
miss
de
clare
as
japhet
newland
i
came
here
to
see
the
fleta
of
former
days
when
i
assume
my
real
name
i
shall
always
be
most
happy
of
an
introduction
to
the
daughter
of
lady
de
clare
oh
how
changed
exclaimed
she
fixing
her
large
blue
eyes
upon
me
prosperity
changes
us
all
miss
de
clare
i
wish
you
a
very
good
morning
and
i
turned
away
and
crossed
the
hall
to
the
door
as
i
went
out
i
could
not
help
looking
back
and
i
perceived
that
cecilia
handkerchief
was
held
to
her
eyes
as
she
slowly
mounted
the
stairs
i
walked
home
to
the
piazza
in
no
very
pleasant
humour
i
was
angry
and
disgusted
at
the
coolness
of
my
reception
i
thought
myself
ill
used
and
treated
with
ingratitude
so
much
for
the
world
said
i
as
i
sat
down
in
my
apartment
and
spun
my
hat
on
the
table
she
has
been
out
two
seasons
and
is
no
longer
the
same
person
yet
how
lovely
she
has
grown
but
why
this
change
and
why
was
harcourt
there
could
he
have
prejudiced
them
against
me
very
possibly
while
these
ideas
were
running
in
my
mind
and
i
was
making
comparisons
between
cecilia
de
clare
and
susannah
temple
not
much
in
favour
of
the
former
and
looking
forward
prospectively
to
the
meeting
with
my
father
the
doubts
as
to
my
reception
in
society
colouring
everything
with
the
most
sombre
tints
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
harcourt
announced
by
the
waiter
a
chair
for
mr
harcourt
said
i
to
the
waiter
with
formality
newland
said
harcourt
i
come
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
i
am
commissioned
by
the
ladies
to
assure
you
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
harcourt
for
interrupting
you
but
i
require
no
ambassador
from
the
ladies
in
question
they
may
make
you
their
confidant
if
they
please
but
i
am
not
at
all
inclined
to
do
the
same
explanation
after
what
i
witnessed
and
felt
this
morning
is
quite
unnecessary
i
surrender
all
claims
upon
either
lady
de
clare
or
her
daughter
if
i
ever
was
so
foolhardy
as
to
imagine
that
i
had
any
the
first
reason
of
your
visit
it
is
therefore
useless
to
proceed
with
may
i
ask
the
other
reason
which
has
procured
me
this
honour
i
hardly
know
mr
newland
replied
harcourt
colouring
deeply
whether
after
what
you
have
now
said
i
ought
to
proceed
with
the
second
it
related
to
myself
i
am
all
attention
mr
harcourt
replied
i
bowing
politely
it
was
to
say
mr
newland
that
i
should
have
taken
the
earliest
opportunity
after
my
recovery
had
you
not
disappeared
so
strangely
to
have
expressed
my
sorrow
for
my
conduct
towards
you
and
to
have
acknowledged
that
i
had
been
deservedly
punished
more
perhaps
by
my
own
feelings
of
remorse
than
by
the
dangerous
wound
i
had
received
by
your
hand
i
take
even
this
opportunity
although
not
apparently
a
favourable
one
of
expressing
what
i
consider
it
my
duty
as
a
gentleman
who
has
wronged
another
to
express
i
certainly
was
going
to
add
more
but
there
is
so
little
chance
of
its
being
well
received
that
i
had
better
defer
it
to
some
future
opportunity
the
time
may
come
and
i
certainly
trust
it
will
come
when
i
may
be
allowed
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
not
deserving
of
the
coolness
with
which
i
am
now
received
mr
newland
with
every
wish
for
your
happiness
i
will
now
take
my
leave
but
i
must
say
it
is
with
painful
sentiments
as
i
feel
that
the
result
of
this
interview
will
be
the
cause
of
great
distress
to
those
who
are
bound
to
you
not
only
by
gratitude
but
sincere
regard
harcourt
then
bowed
and
quitted
the
room
it
all
very
well
muttered
i
but
i
know
the
world
and
am
not
to
be
soothed
down
by
a
few
fine
words
i
trust
that
they
will
be
sorry
for
their
conduct
but
see
me
again
inside
their
doors
they
will
not
and
i
sat
down
trying
to
feel
satisfied
with
myself
but
i
was
not
i
felt
that
i
had
acted
harshly
to
say
no
more
i
ought
to
have
listened
to
an
explanation
sent
by
cecilia
and
her
mother
after
her
coming
down
stairs
to
expostulate
they
were
under
great
obligations
to
me
and
by
my
quick
resentment
i
rendered
the
obligations
more
onerous
it
was
unkind
of
me
and
i
wished
that
harcourt
had
not
left
the
room
as
for
his
conduct
i
tried
to
find
fault
with
it
but
could
not
it
was
gentlemanly
and
feeling
the
fact
was
i
was
in
a
very
bad
humour
and
could
not
at
the
time
discover
the
reason
which
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
that
i
was
more
jealous
of
finding
harcourt
so
intimate
at
lady
de
clare
than
i
was
at
the
unpalatable
reception
which
i
had
me
with
the
waiter
came
in
and
brought
me
a
note
from
mr
masterton
i
have
this
morning
received
a
summons
from
your
father
who
returned
it
appears
two
days
ago
and
is
now
at
the
adelphi
hotel
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
stepping
out
of
his
carriage
when
travelling
he
missed
his
footing
and
snapped
his
tendon
achilles
he
is
laid
up
on
a
couch
and
as
you
may
suppose
his
amiability
is
not
increased
by
the
accident
and
the
pain
attending
it
as
he
has
requested
me
to
bring
forward
immediate
evidence
as
to
your
identity
and
the
presence
of
mr
cophagus
is
necessary
i
propose
that
we
start
for
reading
at
nine
i
have
a
curiosity
to
go
down
there
and
having
a
leisure
day
or
two
it
will
be
a
relaxation
i
wish
to
see
my
old
acquaintance
timothy
and
your
shop
answer
by
bearer
j
masterton
i
wrote
a
few
lines
informing
mr
masterton
that
i
would
be
with
him
at
the
appointed
hour
and
then
sat
down
to
my
solitary
meal
how
different
from
when
i
was
last
at
this
hotel
now
i
knew
nobody
i
had
to
regain
my
footing
in
society
and
that
could
only
be
accomplished
by
being
acknowledged
by
my
father
and
as
soon
as
that
was
done
i
would
call
upon
lord
windermear
who
would
quickly
effect
what
i
desired
the
next
morning
i
was
ready
at
nine
and
set
off
with
post
horses
with
mr
masterton
in
his
own
carriage
i
told
him
what
had
occurred
the
day
before
and
how
disgusted
i
was
at
my
reception
upon
my
word
japhet
i
think
you
are
wrong
replied
the
old
gentleman
and
if
you
had
not
told
me
of
your
affection
for
miss
temple
to
see
whom
i
confess
to
be
one
of
the
chief
motives
of
my
going
down
with
you
i
should
almost
suppose
that
you
were
blinded
by
jealousy
does
it
not
occur
to
you
that
if
mr
harcourt
was
admitted
to
the
ladies
at
such
an
early
hour
there
was
preference
shown
him
in
that
quarter
and
now
i
recollect
that
i
heard
something
about
it
harcourt
elder
brother
died
and
he
come
into
the
property
and
i
heard
somebody
say
that
he
would
in
all
probability
succeed
in
gaining
the
handsomest
girl
in
london
with
a
large
fortune
that
it
was
said
to
be
a
match
now
if
such
be
the
case
and
you
broke
in
upon
a
quiet
reunion
between
two
young
people
about
to
be
united
almost
without
announcement
and
so
unexpectedly
after
a
lapse
of
so
long
a
time
surely
you
can
not
be
surprised
at
there
being
a
degree
of
confusion
and
restraint
more
especially
after
what
had
passed
between
harcourt
and
you
depend
upon
it
that
was
the
cause
of
it
had
lady
de
clare
and
her
daughter
been
alone
your
reception
would
have
been
very
different
indeed
cecilia
following
you
down
stairs
proves
that
it
was
not
from
coolness
towards
you
and
harcourt
calling
upon
you
and
the
conversation
which
took
place
is
another
proof
that
you
have
been
mistaken
i
never
viewed
it
in
that
light
certainly
sir
observed
i
i
merely
perceived
that
i
was
considered
intrusive
and
finding
in
the
company
one
who
had
treated
me
ill
and
had
been
my
antagonist
in
the
field
i
naturally
supposed
that
he
had
prejudiced
them
against
me
i
hope
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
have
seen
so
much
of
the
world
young
as
i
am
that
i
have
become
very
suspicious
then
discard
suspicion
as
fast
as
you
can
it
will
only
make
you
unhappy
and
not
prevent
your
being
deceived
if
you
are
suspicious
you
will
have
the
constant
fear
of
deception
hanging
over
you
which
poisons
existence
after
these
remarks
i
remained
silent
for
some
time
i
was
analysing
my
own
feelings
and
i
felt
that
i
had
acted
in
a
very
absurd
manner
the
fact
was
that
one
of
my
castle
buildings
had
been
that
i
was
to
marry
fleta
as
soon
as
i
had
found
my
own
father
and
this
it
was
which
had
actuated
me
almost
without
my
knowing
it
i
felt
jealous
of
harcourt
and
that
without
being
in
love
with
miss
de
clare
but
actually
passionately
fond
of
another
person
i
felt
as
if
i
could
have
married
her
without
loving
her
and
that
i
could
give
up
susannah
temple
whom
i
did
love
rather
than
that
a
being
whom
i
considered
as
almost
of
my
own
creation
should
herself
presume
to
fall
in
love
or
that
another
should
dare
to
love
her
until
i
had
made
up
my
mind
whether
i
should
take
her
myself
and
this
after
so
long
an
absence
and
their
having
given
up
all
hopes
of
ever
seeing
me
again
the
reader
may
smile
at
the
absurdity
still
more
at
the
selfishness
of
this
feeling
so
did
i
when
i
had
reflected
upon
it
and
i
despised
myself
for
my
vanity
and
folly
what
are
you
thinking
of
japhet
observed
mr
masterton
tired
with
my
long
abstraction
that
i
have
been
making
a
most
egregious
fool
of
myself
sir
replied
i
with
respect
to
the
de
clares
i
did
not
say
so
japhet
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
thought
something
very
like
it
now
tell
me
were
you
not
jealous
at
finding
her
in
company
with
harcourt
exactly
so
sir
i
tell
susannah
temple
when
see
i
her
that
she
may
form
some
idea
of
your
constancy
replied
mr
masterton
smiling
why
what
a
dog
in
the
manger
you
must
be
you
ca
marry
them
both
still
under
the
circumstances
i
can
analyse
the
feeling
it
is
natural
but
all
that
is
natural
is
not
always
creditable
to
human
nature
let
us
talk
a
little
about
susannah
and
all
these
vagaries
will
be
dispersed
how
old
is
she
mr
masterton
plied
me
with
so
many
questions
relative
to
susannah
that
her
image
alone
soon
filled
my
mind
and
i
recovered
my
spirits
i
do
know
what
she
will
say
at
my
being
in
this
dress
sir
observed
i
had
i
not
better
change
it
on
my
arrival
by
no
means
i
fight
your
battle
i
know
her
character
pretty
well
thanks
to
your
raving
about
her
part
three
chapter
nineteen
contains
much
learned
argument
upon
broad
brims
and
garments
of
grey
i
get
the
best
of
it
the
one
great
wish
of
my
life
is
granted
i
meet
my
father
and
a
cold
reception
very
indicative
of
much
we
arrived
in
good
time
at
reading
and
as
soon
as
we
alighted
at
the
inn
we
ordered
dinner
and
then
walked
down
to
the
shop
where
we
found
timothy
very
busy
tying
down
and
labelling
he
was
delighted
to
see
mr
masterton
and
perceiving
that
i
had
laid
aside
the
quaker
dress
made
no
scruple
of
indulging
in
his
humour
making
a
long
face
and
and
mr
masterton
in
a
very
absurd
manner
we
desired
him
to
go
to
mr
cophagus
and
beg
that
he
would
allow
me
to
bring
mr
masterton
to
drink
tea
and
afterwards
to
call
at
the
inn
and
give
us
the
answer
we
then
returned
to
our
dinner
whether
they
will
ever
make
a
quaker
of
you
japhet
i
am
very
doubtful
observed
mr
masterton
as
we
walked
back
but
as
for
making
one
of
that
fellow
timothy
i
defy
them
he
laughs
at
everything
replied
i
and
views
everything
in
a
ridiculous
light
at
all
events
they
never
will
make
him
serious
in
the
evening
we
adjourned
to
the
house
of
mr
cophagus
having
received
a
message
of
welcome
i
entered
the
room
first
susannah
came
forward
to
welcome
me
and
then
drew
back
when
she
perceived
the
alteration
in
my
apparel
colouring
deeply
i
passed
her
and
took
the
hand
of
mrs
cophagus
and
her
husband
and
then
introduced
mr
masterton
we
hardly
knew
thee
japhet
mildly
observed
mrs
cophagus
i
did
not
think
that
outward
garments
would
disguise
me
from
my
friends
replied
i
but
so
it
appeareth
for
your
sister
hath
not
even
greeted
me
in
welcome
i
greet
thee
in
all
kindness
and
all
sincerity
japhet
newland
replied
susannah
holding
out
her
hand
yet
did
i
not
imagine
that
in
so
short
a
time
thou
wouldst
have
dismissed
the
apparel
of
our
persuasion
neither
do
i
find
it
seemly
miss
temple
interposed
mr
masterton
it
is
to
oblige
those
who
are
his
sincere
friends
that
mr
newland
has
laid
aside
his
dress
i
quarrel
with
no
creed
everyone
has
a
right
to
choose
for
himself
and
mr
newland
has
perhaps
not
chosen
badly
in
embracing
your
tenets
let
him
continue
steadfast
in
them
but
fair
young
lady
there
is
no
creed
which
is
perfect
and
even
in
yours
we
find
imperfection
our
religion
preaches
humility
and
therefore
we
do
object
to
his
wearing
the
garb
of
pride
of
pride
sayest
thou
hath
he
not
rather
put
off
the
garb
of
humility
and
now
appeareth
in
the
garb
of
pride
not
so
young
madam
when
we
dress
as
all
the
world
dress
we
wear
not
the
garb
of
pride
but
when
we
put
on
a
dress
different
from
others
that
distinguishes
us
from
others
then
we
show
our
pride
and
the
worst
of
pride
for
it
is
the
hypocritical
pride
which
apes
humility
it
is
the
pharisee
of
the
scriptures
who
preaches
in
high
places
and
sounds
forth
his
charity
to
the
poor
not
the
humility
of
the
publican
who
says
be
merciful
to
me
a
sinner
your
apparel
of
pretended
humility
is
the
garb
of
pride
and
for
that
reason
have
we
insisted
that
he
discards
it
when
with
us
his
tenets
we
interfere
not
with
there
can
be
no
religion
in
dress
and
that
must
indeed
be
weak
in
itself
which
requires
dress
for
its
support
susannah
was
astonished
at
this
new
feature
of
the
case
so
aptly
put
by
the
old
lawyer
mrs
cophagus
looked
at
her
husband
and
cophagus
pinched
my
arm
evidently
agreeing
with
him
when
mr
masterton
had
finished
speaking
susannah
waited
a
few
seconds
and
then
replied
it
becomes
not
one
so
young
and
weak
as
i
am
to
argue
with
thee
who
art
so
much
my
senior
i
can
not
cavil
at
opinions
which
if
not
correct
at
least
are
founded
on
the
holy
writings
but
i
have
been
otherwise
instructed
then
let
us
drop
the
argument
miss
susannah
and
let
me
tell
you
that
japhet
wished
to
resume
his
quaker
dress
and
i
would
not
permit
him
if
there
is
any
blame
it
is
to
be
laid
to
me
and
it
no
use
being
angry
with
an
old
man
like
myself
i
have
no
right
to
be
angry
with
anyone
replied
susannah
but
you
were
angry
with
me
susannah
interrupted
i
i
can
not
say
that
it
was
anger
japhet
newland
i
hardly
know
what
the
feeling
might
have
been
but
i
was
wrong
and
i
must
request
thy
forgiveness
and
susannah
held
out
her
hand
now
you
must
forgive
me
too
miss
temple
said
old
masterton
and
susannah
laughed
against
her
wishes
the
conversation
then
became
general
mr
masterton
explained
to
mr
cophagus
what
he
required
of
him
and
mr
cophagus
immediately
acceded
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
go
to
town
by
the
mail
the
next
day
mr
masterton
talked
a
great
deal
about
my
father
and
gave
his
character
in
its
true
light
as
he
considered
it
would
be
advantageous
to
me
so
to
do
he
then
entered
into
conversation
upon
a
variety
of
topics
and
was
certainly
very
amusing
susannah
laughed
very
heartily
before
the
evening
was
over
and
mr
masterton
retired
to
the
hotel
for
i
had
resolved
to
sleep
in
my
own
bed
i
walked
home
with
mr
masterton
i
then
returned
to
the
house
and
found
them
all
in
the
parlour
mrs
cophagus
was
expressing
her
delight
at
the
amusement
she
had
received
when
i
entered
with
a
grave
face
i
wish
that
i
had
not
left
you
said
i
to
mrs
cophagus
i
am
afraid
to
meet
my
father
he
will
exact
the
most
implicit
obedience
what
am
i
to
do
must
not
i
obey
him
in
all
things
lawful
replied
susannah
most
certainly
japhet
in
all
things
lawful
susannah
now
tell
me
in
the
very
case
of
my
apparel
mr
masterton
says
that
he
never
will
permit
me
to
wear
the
dress
what
am
i
to
do
thou
hast
thy
religion
and
thy
bible
for
thy
guide
japhet
i
have
and
in
the
bible
i
find
written
on
tablets
of
stone
by
the
prophet
of
god
thy
father
and
thy
mother
there
is
a
positive
commandment
but
i
find
no
commandment
to
wear
this
or
that
dress
what
think
you
continued
i
appealing
to
them
all
i
should
bid
thee
honour
thy
father
japhet
replied
mrs
cophagus
and
you
susannah
i
shall
bid
thee
good
night
japhet
at
this
reply
we
all
laughed
and
i
perceived
there
was
a
smile
on
susannah
face
as
she
walked
away
mrs
cophagus
followed
her
laughing
as
she
went
and
cophagus
and
i
were
alone
well
japhet
see
old
gentleman
kiss
shake
hands
and
blessing
and
so
on
yes
sir
replied
i
but
if
he
treats
me
ill
i
shall
probably
come
down
here
again
i
am
afraid
that
susannah
is
not
very
well
pleased
with
me
pooh
nonsense
wife
knows
all
die
for
you
japhet
do
as
you
please
dress
yourself
dress
her
any
dress
no
dress
like
eve
sly
puss
lose
you
all
right
and
so
on
i
pressed
mr
cophagus
to
tell
me
all
he
knew
and
i
found
from
him
that
his
wife
had
questioned
susannah
soon
after
my
departure
had
found
her
weeping
and
that
she
had
gained
from
her
the
avowal
of
her
ardent
affection
for
me
this
was
all
i
wanted
and
i
wished
him
good
night
and
went
to
bed
happy
i
had
an
interview
with
susannah
temple
before
i
left
the
next
morning
and
although
i
never
mentioned
love
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
she
was
kind
and
affectionate
spoke
to
me
in
her
usual
serious
manner
warned
me
against
the
world
acknowledged
that
i
should
have
great
difficulties
to
surmount
and
even
made
much
allowance
for
my
peculiar
situation
she
dared
not
advise
but
she
would
pray
for
me
there
was
a
greater
show
of
interest
and
confidence
towards
me
than
i
had
ever
yet
received
from
her
when
i
parted
from
her
i
said
dear
susannah
whatever
change
may
take
place
in
my
fortunes
or
in
my
dress
believe
me
my
heart
shall
not
be
changed
and
i
shall
ever
adhere
to
those
principles
which
have
been
instilled
into
me
since
i
have
been
in
your
company
this
was
a
phrase
which
admitted
of
a
double
meaning
and
she
replied
i
should
wish
to
see
thee
perfect
japhet
but
there
is
no
perfection
now
on
earth
be
therefore
as
perfect
as
you
can
god
bless
you
susannah
may
the
blessing
of
the
lord
be
on
you
always
japhet
replied
she
i
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
and
slightly
pressed
her
to
my
bosom
she
gently
disengaged
herself
and
her
large
eyes
glistened
with
tears
as
she
left
the
room
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
was
with
mr
masterton
on
the
road
to
london
japhet
said
the
old
gentleman
i
will
say
that
you
have
been
very
wise
in
your
choice
and
that
your
little
quaker
is
a
most
lovely
creature
i
am
in
love
with
her
myself
and
i
think
that
she
is
far
superior
in
personal
attractions
to
cecilia
de
clare
indeed
sir
yes
indeed
her
face
is
more
classical
and
her
complexion
is
unrivalled
as
far
as
my
present
knowledge
and
experience
go
she
is
an
emblem
of
purity
her
mind
sir
is
as
pure
as
her
person
i
believe
it
she
has
a
strong
mind
and
will
think
for
herself
there
sir
is
i
am
afraid
the
difficulty
she
will
not
yield
a
point
in
which
she
thinks
she
is
right
not
even
for
her
love
for
me
i
agree
with
you
that
she
will
not
and
i
admire
her
for
it
but
japhet
she
will
yield
to
conviction
and
depend
upon
it
she
will
abandon
the
outward
observances
of
her
persuasion
did
you
observe
what
a
spoke
i
put
in
your
wheel
last
night
when
i
stated
that
outward
forms
were
pride
leave
that
to
work
and
i
answer
for
the
consequences
she
will
not
long
wear
that
quaker
dress
how
beautiful
she
would
be
if
she
dressed
like
other
people
i
think
i
see
her
now
entering
a
but
what
occasions
you
to
think
she
will
abandon
her
persuasion
i
do
not
say
that
she
will
abandon
it
nor
do
i
wish
her
to
do
it
nor
do
i
wish
you
to
do
it
japhet
there
is
much
beauty
and
much
perfection
in
the
quaker
creed
all
that
requires
to
be
abandoned
are
the
dress
and
the
ceremonies
of
the
meetings
which
are
both
absurdities
recollect
that
miss
temple
has
been
brought
up
as
a
quaker
she
has
from
the
exclusiveness
of
the
sect
known
no
other
form
of
worship
and
never
heard
any
opposition
to
that
which
has
been
inculcated
but
let
her
once
or
twice
enter
the
established
church
hear
its
beautiful
ritual
and
listen
to
a
sound
preacher
let
her
be
persuaded
to
do
that
which
can
not
be
asking
her
to
do
wrong
and
then
let
her
think
and
act
for
herself
and
my
word
for
it
when
she
draws
the
comparison
between
what
she
has
then
heard
and
the
nonsense
occasionally
uttered
in
the
quaker
conventicle
by
those
who
fancy
themselves
inspired
she
will
herself
feel
that
although
the
tenets
of
her
persuasion
may
be
more
in
accordance
with
true
christianity
than
those
of
other
sects
the
outward
forms
and
observances
are
imperfect
i
trust
to
her
own
good
sense
you
make
me
very
happy
by
saying
so
well
that
is
my
opinion
of
her
and
if
she
proves
me
to
be
correct
hang
me
if
i
do
think
i
shall
adopt
her
what
do
you
think
of
mrs
cophagus
sir
i
think
she
is
no
more
a
quaker
in
her
heart
than
i
am
she
is
a
lively
merry
creature
and
would
have
no
objection
to
appear
in
feathers
and
diamonds
well
sir
i
can
tell
you
that
mr
cophagus
still
sighs
after
his
blue
cotton
net
pantaloons
and
hessian
boots
more
fool
he
but
however
i
am
glad
of
it
for
it
gives
me
an
idea
which
i
shall
work
upon
at
present
we
have
this
eventful
meeting
between
you
and
your
father
to
occupy
us
we
arrived
in
town
in
time
for
dinner
which
mr
masterton
had
ordered
at
his
chambers
as
the
old
gentleman
was
rather
tired
with
his
two
days
travelling
i
wished
him
good
night
at
an
early
hour
recollect
japhet
we
are
to
be
at
the
adelphi
hotel
at
one
come
in
time
i
called
upon
mr
masterton
at
the
time
appointed
on
the
ensuing
day
and
we
drove
to
the
hotel
in
which
my
father
had
located
himself
on
our
arrival
we
were
ushered
into
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
where
we
found
mr
cophagus
and
two
of
the
governors
of
the
foundling
hospital
really
mr
masterton
said
one
of
the
latter
gentlemen
one
would
think
that
we
were
about
to
have
an
audience
with
a
sovereign
prince
and
instead
of
conferring
favours
were
about
to
receive
them
my
time
is
precious
i
ought
to
have
been
in
the
city
this
half
hour
and
here
is
this
old
nabob
keeping
us
waiting
as
if
we
were
petitioners
mr
masterton
laughed
and
said
let
us
all
go
up
stairs
and
not
wait
to
be
sent
for
he
called
one
of
the
waiters
and
desired
him
to
announce
them
to
general
de
benyon
they
then
followed
the
waiter
leaving
me
alone
i
must
say
that
i
was
a
little
agitated
i
heard
the
door
open
above
and
then
an
angry
growl
like
that
of
a
wild
beast
the
door
closed
again
and
all
was
quiet
and
this
thought
i
is
the
result
of
all
my
fond
anticipations
of
my
ardent
wishes
of
my
enthusiastic
search
instead
of
expressing
anxiety
to
receive
his
son
he
litigiously
requires
proofs
and
more
proofs
when
he
has
received
every
satisfactory
proof
already
they
say
his
temper
is
violent
beyond
control
and
that
submission
irritates
instead
of
appeasing
him
what
then
if
i
resent
i
have
heard
that
people
of
that
description
are
to
be
better
met
with
their
own
weapons
suppose
i
try
it
but
no
i
have
no
right
i
will
however
be
firm
and
keep
my
temper
under
every
circumstance
i
will
show
him
at
least
that
his
son
has
the
spirit
and
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
as
these
thoughts
passed
in
my
mind
the
door
opened
and
mr
masterton
requested
me
to
follow
him
i
obeyed
with
a
palpitating
heart
and
when
i
had
gained
the
up
stairs
mr
masterton
took
my
hand
and
led
me
into
the
presence
of
my
and
i
may
as
well
describe
him
and
the
whole
tableau
the
room
was
long
and
narrow
and
at
the
farther
end
was
a
large
sofa
on
which
was
seated
my
father
with
his
injured
leg
reposing
on
it
his
crutches
propped
against
the
wall
on
each
side
of
him
were
two
large
poles
and
stands
each
with
a
magnificent
macaw
next
to
the
macaws
were
two
native
servants
arrayed
in
their
muslin
dresses
with
their
arms
folded
a
hookah
was
in
advance
of
the
table
before
the
sofa
it
was
magnificently
wrought
in
silver
and
the
snake
passed
under
the
table
so
that
the
tube
was
within
my
honoured
father
reach
on
one
side
of
the
room
sat
the
two
governors
of
the
foundling
hospital
on
the
other
was
seated
mr
cophagus
in
his
quaker
dress
the
empty
chair
next
to
him
had
been
occupied
by
mr
masterton
i
looked
at
my
father
he
was
a
man
of
great
size
apparently
six
feet
three
or
four
inches
and
stout
in
proportion
without
being
burdened
with
fat
he
was
gaunt
and
muscular
and
i
think
must
have
weighed
seventeen
or
eighteen
stone
his
head
was
in
proportion
to
his
body
and
very
large
so
were
all
his
features
upon
the
same
grand
scale
his
complexion
was
of
a
and
his
hair
of
a
snowy
white
he
wore
his
whiskers
very
large
and
joined
together
under
the
throat
and
these
which
were
also
white
from
the
circle
which
they
formed
round
his
face
and
contrasting
with
the
colour
of
his
skin
gave
his
much
more
the
appearance
of
a
royal
bengal
tiger
than
a
gentleman
general
de
benyon
saw
mr
masterton
leading
me
forward
to
within
a
pace
or
two
of
the
table
before
the
allow
me
the
pleasure
of
introducing
your
son
japhet
there
was
no
hand
extended
to
welcome
me
my
father
fixed
his
proud
grey
eyes
upon
me
for
a
moment
and
then
turned
to
the
governors
of
the
hospital
is
this
the
person
gentlemen
whom
you
received
as
an
infant
and
brought
up
as
japhet
newland
the
governors
declared
i
was
the
same
person
that
they
had
bound
me
to
mr
cophagus
and
had
seen
me
more
than
once
since
i
quitted
the
asylum
is
this
the
japhet
newland
whom
you
received
from
these
gentlemen
and
brought
up
to
your
business
yea
and
verily
i
do
affirm
the
same
smart
lad
good
boy
and
so
on
i
will
not
take
a
quaker
affirmation
will
you
take
your
oath
sir
yes
replied
cophagus
forgetting
his
quakership
take
oath
bring
bible
kiss
book
and
so
on
you
then
as
a
quaker
have
no
objection
to
swear
to
the
identity
of
this
person
swear
cried
cophagus
yes
swear
swear
now
not
japhet
damned
go
to
hell
and
so
on
the
other
parties
present
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
explosion
from
cophagus
neither
could
mr
masterton
then
asked
the
general
if
he
required
any
more
proofs
no
replied
the
general
discourteously
and
speaking
in
hindostanee
to
his
attendants
they
walked
to
the
door
and
opened
it
the
hint
was
taken
mr
masterton
saying
to
the
others
in
an
ironical
tone
after
so
long
a
separation
gentlemen
it
must
be
natural
that
the
general
should

father
and
i
grow
warm
in
our
argument
obliged
to
give
him
a
little
schooling
to
show
my
affection
takes
it
at
last
very
kindly
and
very
dutifully
owns
himself
a
fool
in
the
mean
time
i
was
left
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
gentlemen
departed
and
the
two
native
servants
resumed
their
stations
on
each
side
of
the
sofa
i
felt
humiliated
and
indignant
but
waited
in
silence
at
last
my
honoured
parent
who
had
eyed
me
for
some
time
commenced
if
you
think
young
man
to
win
my
favour
by
your
good
looks
you
are
very
much
mistaken
you
are
too
like
your
mother
whose
memory
is
anything
but
agreeable
the
blood
mounted
to
my
forehead
at
this
cruel
observation
i
folded
my
arms
and
looked
my
father
steadfastly
in
the
face
but
made
no
reply
the
choler
of
the
gentleman
was
raised
it
appears
that
i
have
found
a
most
dutiful
son
i
was
about
to
make
an
angry
answer
when
i
recollected
myself
and
i
courteously
replied
my
dear
general
depend
upon
it
that
your
son
will
always
be
ready
to
pay
duty
to
whom
duty
is
due
but
excuse
me
in
the
agitation
of
this
meeting
you
have
forgotten
those
little
attentions
which
courtesy
demands
with
your
permission
i
will
take
a
chair
and
then
we
may
converse
more
at
our
ease
i
hope
your
leg
is
better
i
said
this
with
the
blandest
voice
and
the
most
studied
politeness
and
drawing
a
chair
towards
the
table
i
took
my
seat
as
i
expected
it
put
my
honoured
father
in
a
tremendous
rage
if
this
is
a
specimen
sir
of
your
duty
and
respect
sir
i
hope
to
see
no
more
of
them
to
whom
your
duty
is
due
sir
and
pray
to
whom
is
it
due
sir
if
not
to
the
author
of
your
existence
cried
the
general
striking
the
table
before
him
with
his
enormous
fist
so
as
to
make
the
ink
fly
out
of
the
stand
some
inches
high
and
bespatter
the
papers
near
it
my
dear
father
you
are
perfectly
correct
duty
as
you
say
is
due
to
the
author
of
our
existence
if
i
recollect
right
the
commandment
says
your
father
and
your
mother
but
at
the
same
time
if
i
may
venture
to
offer
an
observation
are
there
not
such
things
as
reciprocal
duties
some
which
are
even
more
paramount
in
a
father
than
the
mere
begetting
of
a
son
what
do
you
mean
sir
by
these
insolent
remarks
interrupted
my
father
excuse
me
my
dear
father
i
may
be
wrong
but
if
so
i
will
bow
to
your
superior
judgment
but
it
does
appear
to
me
that
the
mere
hanging
me
in
a
basket
at
the
gate
of
the
foundling
hospital
and
leaving
me
a
bank
note
of
fifty
pounds
to
educate
and
maintain
me
until
the
age
of
are
not
exactly
all
the
duties
incumbent
upon
a
parent
if
you
think
that
they
are
i
am
afraid
that
the
world
as
well
as
myself
will
be
of
a
different
opinion
not
that
i
intend
to
make
any
complaint
as
i
feel
assured
that
now
circumstances
have
put
it
in
your
power
it
is
your
intention
to
make
me
amends
for
leaving
me
so
long
in
a
state
of
destitution
and
wholly
dependent
upon
my
own
resources
you
do
do
you
sir
well
now
i
tell
you
my
resolution
which
is
there
is
the
door
go
out
and
never
let
me
see
your
face
again
my
dear
father
as
i
am
convinced
this
is
only
a
little
pleasantry
on
your
part
or
perhaps
a
mere
trial
whether
i
am
possessed
of
the
spirit
and
determination
of
a
de
benyon
i
shall
of
course
please
you
by
not
complying
with
your
humorous
request
wo
you
by
gad
roared
my
father
then
turning
to
his
two
native
servants
he
spoke
to
them
in
hindostanee
they
immediately
walked
to
the
door
threw
it
wide
open
and
then
coming
back
to
me
were
about
to
take
me
by
the
arms
i
certainly
felt
my
blood
boil
but
i
recollected
how
necessary
it
was
to
keep
my
temper
i
rose
from
my
chair
and
advancing
to
the
side
of
the
sofa
i
said
my
dear
father
as
i
perceive
that
you
do
not
require
your
crutches
at
this
moment
you
will
not
perhaps
object
to
my
taking
one
these
foreign
scoundrels
must
not
be
permitted
to
insult
you
through
the
person
of
your
only
son
turn
him
out
roared
my
father
the
natives
advanced
but
i
whirled
the
crutch
round
my
head
and
in
a
moment
they
were
both
prostrate
as
soon
as
they
gained
their
feet
i
attacked
them
again
until
they
made
their
escape
out
of
the
room
i
then
shut
the
door
and
turned
the
key
thank
you
my
dear
sir
said
i
returning
the
crutch
to
where
it
was
before
many
thanks
for
thus
permitting
me
to
chastise
the
insolence
of
these
black
scoundrels
whom
i
take
it
for
granted
you
will
immediately
discharge
and
i
again
took
my
seat
in
the
chair
bringing
it
closer
to
him
the
rage
of
the
general
was
now
beyond
all
bounds
the
white
foam
was
spluttered
out
of
his
mouth
as
he
in
vain
endeavoured
to
find
words
once
he
actually
rose
from
the
sofa
to
take
the
law
in
his
own
hands
but
the
effort
seriously
injured
his
leg
and
he
threw
himself
down
in
pain
and
disappointment
my
dear
father
i
am
afraid
that
in
your
anxiety
to
help
me
you
have
hurt
your
leg
again
said
i
in
a
soothing
voice
sirrah
sirrah
exclaimed
he
at
last
if
you
think
that
this
will
do
you
are
very
much
mistaken
you
do
know
me
you
may
turn
out
a
couple
of
cowardly
blacks
but
now
i
show
you
that
i
am
not
to
be
played
with
i
discard
you
for
ever
i
disinherit
i
disacknowledge
you
you
may
take
your
choice
either
to
quit
this
room
or
be
put
into
the
hands
of
the
police
the
police
my
dear
sir
what
can
the
police
do
i
may
call
in
the
police
for
the
assault
just
committed
by
your
servants
and
have
them
up
to
bow
street
but
you
can
not
charge
me
with
an
assault
but
i
will
by
gad
sir
true
or
not
true
indeed
you
would
not
my
dear
father
a
de
benyon
would
never
be
guilty
of
a
lie
besides
if
you
were
to
call
in
the
police
i
wish
to
argue
this
matter
coolly
because
i
ascribe
your
present
little
burst
of
to
your
sufferings
from
your
unfortunate
accident
allowing
then
my
dear
father
that
you
were
to
charge
me
with
an
assault
i
should
immediately
be
under
the
necessity
of
charging
you
also
and
then
we
must
both
go
to
bow
street
together
were
you
ever
at
bow
street
general
the
general
made
no
reply
and
i
proceeded
besides
my
dear
sir
only
imagine
how
very
awkward
it
would
be
when
the
magistrate
put
you
on
your
oath
and
asked
you
to
make
your
charge
what
would
you
be
obliged
to
declare
that
you
had
married
when
young
and
finding
that
your
wife
had
no
fortune
had
deserted
her
the
second
day
after
your
marriage
that
you
an
officer
in
the
army
and
the
honourable
captain
de
benyon
had
hung
up
your
child
at
the
gates
of
the
foundling
hospital
that
you
had
again
met
your
wife
married
to
another
and
had
been
an
accomplice
in
concealing
her
capital
offence
of
bigamy
and
had
had
meetings
with
her
although
she
belonged
to
another
i
say
meetings
for
you
did
meet
her
to
receive
her
directions
about
me
i
am
charitable
and
suspect
nothing
others
will
not
be
so
then
after
her
death
you
come
home
and
inquire
about
your
son
his
identity
is
established
and
what
then
not
only
you
do
not
take
him
by
the
hand
in
common
civility
i
might
say
but
you
first
try
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
and
to
give
him
in
charge
of
the
police
and
then
you
will
have
to
state
for
what
perhaps
you
will
answer
me
that
question
for
i
really
do
not
know
by
this
time
my
honoured
father
wrath
had
to
a
certain
degree
subsided
he
heard
all
i
had
to
say
and
he
felt
how
very
ridiculous
would
have
been
his
intended
proceedings
and
as
his
wrath
subsided
so
did
his
pain
increase
he
had
seriously
injured
his
leg
and
it
was
swelling
rapidly
the
bandages
tightened
in
consequence
and
he
was
suffering
under
the
acutest
pain
oh
oh
groaned
he
my
dear
father
can
i
assist
you
ring
the
bell
sir
there
is
no
occasion
to
summon
assistance
while
i
am
here
my
dear
general
i
can
attend
you
professionally
and
if
you
will
allow
me
will
soon
relieve
your
pain
your
leg
has
swollen
from
exertion
and
the
bandages
must
be
loosened
he
made
no
reply
but
his
features
were
distorted
with
extreme
pain
i
went
to
him
and
proceeded
to
unloose
the
bandages
which
gave
him
considerable
relief
i
then
replaced
them
and
with
great
tenderness
and
going
to
the
sideboard
took
the
lotion
which
was
standing
there
with
the
other
bottles
and
wetted
the
bandages
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
quite
relieved
perhaps
sir
said
i
you
had
better
try
to
sleep
a
little
i
will
take
a
book
and
shall
have
great
pleasure
in
watching
by
your
side
exhausted
with
pain
and
violence
the
general
made
no
reply
he
fell
back
on
the
sofa
and
in
a
short
time
he
snored
most
comfortably
i
have
conquered
you
thought
i
as
i
watched
him
as
he
lay
asleep
if
i
have
not
yet
i
will
that
i
am
resolved
i
walked
gently
to
the
door
unlocked
it
and
opening
it
without
waking
him
ordered
some
broth
to
be
brought
up
immediately
saying
that
the
general
was
asleep
and
that
i
would
wait
for
it
outside
i
accomplished
this
little
manoeuvre
and
reclosed
the
door
without
waking
my
father
and
then
i
took
my
seat
in
the
chair
and
resumed
my
book
having
placed
the
broth
on
the
side
of
the
fire
grate
to
keep
it
warm
in
about
an
hour
he
awoke
and
looked
around
him
do
you
want
anything
my
dearest
father
inquired
i
the
general
appeared
undecided
as
to
whether
to
recommence
hostilities
but
at
last
he
said
i
wish
the
attendance
of
my
servants
sir
the
attendance
of
a
servant
can
never
be
equal
to
that
of
your
own
son
general
replied
i
going
to
the
fire
and
taking
the
basin
of
broth
which
i
replaced
upon
the
tray
containing
the
on
a
napkin
i
expected
you
would
require
your
broth
and
i
have
had
it
ready
for
you
it
was
what
i
did
require
sir
i
must
acknowledge
replied
my
father
and
without
further
remark
he
finished
the
broth
i
removed
the
tray
and
then
went
for
the
lotion
and
again
wetted
the
bandages
on
his
leg
is
there
anything
else
i
can
do
for
you
sir
said
i
nothing
i
am
very
comfortable
then
sir
replied
i
i
will
now
take
my
leave
you
have
desired
me
to
quit
your
presence
for
ever
and
you
attempted
force
i
resisted
that
because
i
would
not
allow
you
to
have
the
painful
remembrance
that
you
had
injured
one
who
had
strong
claims
upon
you
and
had
never
injured
you
i
resented
it
also
because
i
wished
to
prove
to
you
that
i
was
a
de
benyon
and
had
spirit
to
resist
an
insult
but
general
if
you
imagine
that
i
have
come
here
with
a
determination
of
forcing
myself
upon
you
you
are
much
mistaken
i
am
too
proud
and
happily
am
independent
by
my
own
exertions
so
as
not
to
require
your
assistance
had
you
received
me
kindly
believe
me
you
would
have
found
a
grateful
and
affectionate
heart
to
have
met
that
kindness
you
would
have
found
a
son
whose
sole
object
through
life
has
been
to
discover
a
father
after
whom
he
has
yearned
who
would
have
been
delighted
to
have
administered
to
his
wants
to
have
yielded
to
his
wishes
to
have
soothed
him
in
his
pain
and
to
have
watched
him
in
his
sickness
deserted
as
i
have
been
for
so
many
years
i
trust
that
i
have
not
disgraced
you
general
de
benyon
and
if
ever
i
have
done
wrong
it
has
been
from
a
wish
to
discover
you
i
can
appeal
to
lord
windermear
for
the
truth
of
that
assertion
allow
me
to
say
that
it
is
a
very
severe
trial
an
ordeal
which
few
pass
through
with
safety
to
be
thrown
as
i
have
been
upon
the
world
with
no
friend
no
parent
to
assist
or
to
advise
me
to
have
to
bear
up
against
the
contingency
of
being
of
unacknowledged
and
perhaps
disgraceful
birth
it
is
harder
still
when
i
expected
to
find
my
dearest
wishes
realised
that
without
any
other
cause
than
that
of
my
features
resembling
those
of
my
mother
i
am
to
be
again
cast
away
one
thing
general
de
benyon
i
request
and
i
trust
it
will
not
be
denied
which
is
that
i
may
assume
the
name
which
i
am
entitled
to
i
pledge
you
that
i
never
will
disgrace
it
and
now
sir
asking
and
expecting
no
more
i
take
my
leave
and
you
may
be
assured
that
neither
poverty
privation
nor
affliction
of
any
kind
will
ever
induce
me
to
again
intrude
into
your
presence
general
de
benyon
farewell
for
ever
i
made
my
father
a
profound
bow
and
was
quitting
the
room
stop
sir
said
the
general
stop
one
moment
if
you
please
i
obeyed
why
did
you
put
me
out
of
temper
answer
me
that
allow
me
to
observe
sir
that
i
did
not
put
you
out
of
temper
and
what
is
more
that
i
never
lost
my
own
temper
during
the
insult
and
injury
which
i
so
undeservedly
and
unexpectedly
have
received
but
that
very
keeping
your
temper
made
me
more
angry
sir
that
is
very
possible
but
surely
i
was
not
to
blame
the
greatest
proof
of
a
perfect
gentleman
is
that
he
is
able
to
command
his
temper
and
i
wished
you
to
acknowledge
that
i
was
not
without
such
pretensions
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
your
father
is
no
gentleman
and
this
i
presume
is
a
specimen
of
your
filial
duty
replied
the
general
warmly
far
from
it
sir
there
are
many
gentlemen
who
unfortunately
can
not
command
their
tempers
and
are
more
to
be
pitied
than
blamed
for
it
but
sir
when
such
happens
to
be
the
case
they
invariably
redeem
their
error
and
amply
so
by
expressing
their
sorrow
and
offering
an
apology
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
expect
me
to
apologise
to
you
allow
me
sir
to
ask
you
did
you
ever
know
a
de
benyon
submit
to
an
insult
no
sir
i
trust
not
then
sir
those
whose
feelings
of
pride
will
not
allow
them
to
submit
to
an
insult
ought
never
to
insult
others
if
in
the
warmth
of
the
moment
they
have
done
so
that
pride
should
immediately
induce
them
to
offer
an
apology
not
only
due
to
the
party
but
to
their
own
characters
there
is
no
disgrace
in
making
an
apology
when
we
are
in
error
but
there
is
a
great
disgrace
in
withholding
such
an
act
of
common
justice
and
reparation
i
presume
i
am
to
infer
from
all
this
that
you
expect
an
apology
from
me
general
de
benyon
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
is
now
of
little
importance
we
part
and
shall
probably
never
meet
again
if
you
think
that
it
would
make
you
feel
more
comfortable
i
am
willing
to
receive
it
i
must
suppose
by
that
observation
that
you
fully
expect
it
and
otherwise
will
not
stay
i
never
had
a
thought
of
staying
general
you
have
told
me
that
you
have
disinherited
and
discarded
me
for
ever
no
one
with
the
feelings
of
a
man
would
ever
think
of
remaining
after
such
a
declaration
upon
what
terms
then
sir
am
i
to
understand
that
you
will
consent
to
remain
with
me
and
forget
all
that
has
passed
my
terms
are
simple
general
you
must
say
that
you
retract
what
you
have
said
and
are
very
sorry
for
having
insulted
me
and
without
i
do
that
you
will
never
come
here
again
most
decidedly
not
sir
i
shall
always
wish
you
well
pray
for
your
happiness
be
sorry
at
your
death
and
attend
your
funeral
as
chief
mourner
although
you
disinherit
me
that
is
my
duty
in
return
for
my
having
taken
your
name
and
your
having
acknowledged
that
i
am
your
son
but
live
with
you
or
even
see
you
occasionally
i
will
not
after
what
has
passed
this
day
without
you
make
me
an
apology
i
was
not
aware
that
it
was
necessary
for
a
father
to
apologise
to
his
son
if
you
wrong
a
stranger
you
offer
an
apology
how
much
more
is
it
due
to
a
near
relation
but
a
parent
has
claims
upon
his
own
son
sir
for
which
he
is
bound
to
tender
his
duty
i
grant
it
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
in
this
life
but
general
de
benyon
what
claims
have
you
as
a
parent
upon
me
a
son
in
most
cases
is
indebted
to
his
parents
for
their
care
and
attention
in
infancy
his
education
his
religious
instruction
his
choice
of
a
profession
and
his
advancement
in
life
by
their
exertions
and
interest
and
when
they
are
called
away
he
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
their
leaving
him
a
portion
of
their
substance
they
have
a
heavy
debt
of
gratitude
to
pay
for
what
they
have
received
and
they
are
further
checked
by
the
hopes
of
what
they
may
hereafter
receive
up
to
this
time
sir
i
have
not
received
the
first
and
this
day
i
am
told
that
i
need
not
expect
the
last
allow
me
to
ask
you
general
de
benyon
upon
what
grounds
you
claim
from
me
a
filial
duty
certainly
not
for
benefits
received
or
for
benefits
in
expectation
but
i
feel
that
i
am
intruding
and
therefore
sir
once
more
with
every
wish
for
your
happiness
i
take
my
leave
i
went
out
and
had
half
closed
the
door
after
me
when
the
general
cried
out
stop
do
go
japhet
my
son
i
was
in
a
passion
i
beg
your
pardon
do
mind
what
i
said
i
a
passionate
old
fool
as
he
uttered
this
in
broken
sentences
i
returned
to
him
he
held
out
his
hand
forgive
me
boy
forgive
your
father
i
knelt
down
and
kissed
his
hand
he
drew
me
towards
him
and
i
wept
upon
his
bosom
part
three
chapter
twenty
one
father
still
dutifully
submissive
at
home
abroad
i
am
splitting
a
straw
in
arguments
with
susannah
about
straw
bonnets
the
rest
of
the
chapter
contains
coquetry
courting
and
costumes
it
was
some
time
before
we
were
sufficiently
composed
to
enter
into
conversation
and
then
i
tried
my
utmost
to
please
him
still
there
was
naturally
a
restraint
on
both
sides
but
i
was
so
particular
and
devoted
in
my
attentions
so
careful
of
giving
offence
that
when
he
complained
of
weariness
and
a
wish
to
retire
he
stipulated
that
i
should
be
with
him
to
breakfast
on
the
next
morning
i
hastened
to
mr
masterton
although
it
was
late
to
communicate
to
him
all
that
had
passed
he
heard
me
with
great
interest
japhet
said
he
you
have
done
well
it
is
the
proudest
day
of
your
life
you
have
completely
mastered
him
the
royal
bengal
tiger
is
tamed
i
wish
you
joy
my
dear
fellow
now
i
trust
that
all
will
be
well
but
keep
your
own
counsel
do
not
let
this
be
known
at
reading
let
them
still
imagine
that
your
father
is
as
passionate
as
ever
which
he
will
be
with
everybody
else
you
have
still
to
follow
up
your
success
and
leave
me
to
help
you
in
other
matters
i
returned
home
to
the
piazza
and
thankful
to
heaven
for
the
events
of
the
day
i
soon
fell
fast
asleep
and
dreamt
of
susannah
temple
the
next
morning
i
was
early
at
the
adelphi
hotel
my
father
had
not
yet
risen
but
the
native
servants
who
passed
in
and
out
attending
upon
him
and
who
took
care
to
give
me
a
wide
berth
had
informed
him
that
burra
sahib
son
was
come
and
he
sent
for
me
his
leg
was
very
painful
and
uncomfortable
and
the
surgeon
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
i
arranged
it
as
before
and
he
then
dressed
and
came
out
to
breakfast
i
had
said
nothing
before
the
servants
but
as
soon
as
he
was
comfortable
on
the
sofa
i
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
saying
good
morning
my
dear
father
i
hope
you
do
not
repent
of
your
kindness
to
me
yesterday
no
no
god
bless
you
boy
i
been
thinking
of
you
all
night
all
right
thought
i
and
i
trust
to
be
able
to
keep
it
so
i
shall
pass
over
a
fortnight
during
which
i
was
in
constant
attendance
upon
my
father
at
times
he
would
fly
out
in
a
most
violent
manner
but
i
invariably
kept
my
temper
and
when
it
was
all
over
would
laugh
at
him
generally
repeating
and
acting
all
which
he
had
said
and
done
during
his
paroxysm
i
found
this
rather
dangerous
ground
at
first
but
by
degrees
he
became
used
to
it
and
it
was
wonderful
how
it
acted
as
a
check
upon
him
he
would
not
at
first
believe
but
that
i
exaggerated
when
the
picture
was
held
up
to
his
view
and
he
was
again
calm
my
father
was
not
naturally
a
man
but
having
been
living
among
a
servile
race
and
holding
high
command
in
the
army
he
had
gradually
acquired
a
habit
of
authority
and
an
impatience
of
contradiction
which
was
unbearable
to
all
around
those
who
were
and
sensitive
shunned
him
the
servile
and
the
base
continued
with
him
for
their
own
interests
but
trembled
at
his
wrath
i
had
during
this
time
narrated
to
my
father
the
events
of
my
life
and
i
am
happy
to
say
had
by
attention
and
kindness
joined
with
firmness
and
good
temper
acquired
a
dominion
over
him
i
had
at
his
request
removed
to
the
hotel
and
lived
with
him
altogether
his
leg
was
rapidly
arriving
to
a
state
of
convalescence
and
he
now
talked
of
taking
a
house
and
setting
up
his
establishment
in
london
i
had
seen
but
little
of
mr
masterton
during
this
time
as
i
had
remained
in
attendance
upon
the
general
i
had
written
once
to
mr
cophagus
stating
how
i
was
occupied
but
saying
nothing
about
our
reconciliation
one
morning
mr
masterton
called
upon
us
and
after
a
little
conversation
with
the
general
he
told
me
that
he
had
persuaded
mr
cophagus
and
his
wife
to
leave
reading
and
come
to
london
and
that
susannah
temple
was
to
come
with
them
on
a
visit
inquired
i
no
not
on
a
visit
i
have
seen
cophagus
and
he
is
determined
to
cut
the
quakers
and
reside
in
london
altogether
what
does
he
intend
to
return
to
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
this
wicked
world
yes
i
believe
so
and
his
wife
will
join
him
she
has
no
objection
to
decorate
her
pretty
person
i
never
thought
that
she
had
but
susannah
temple
when
susannah
is
away
from
her
friends
when
she
finds
that
her
sister
and
no
longer
wear
the
dress
and
when
she
is
constantly
in
your
company
to
all
which
please
to
add
the
effect
i
trust
of
my
serious
admonitions
she
will
soon
do
as
others
do
or
she
is
no
woman
this
is
all
my
plan
and
leave
it
to
me
only
play
your
part
by
seeing
as
much
of
her
as
you
can
you
need
not
fear
that
replied
i
does
your
father
know
of
your
attachment
inquired
mr
masterton
no
i
passed
her
over
without
mentioning
her
name
replied
i
it
is
too
soon
yet
to
talk
to
him
about
my
marrying
in
fact
the
proposal
must
if
possible
come
from
him
could
not
you
manage
that
yes
i
will
if
i
can
but
as
you
say
wait
awhile
here
is
their
address
you
must
call
if
you
can
and
do
you
think
you
can
dine
with
me
on
thursday
yes
if
the
general
continues
improving
if
not
i
will
send
you
word
the
next
day
i
complained
of
a
and
said
that
i
would
walk
out
until
i
hastened
to
the
address
given
me
by
mr
masterton
and
found
that
mr
cophagus
and
his
wife
were
out
but
susannah
remained
at
home
after
our
first
questions
i
inquired
of
her
how
she
liked
london
i
am
almost
afraid
to
say
japhet
at
least
to
you
you
would
only
laugh
at
me
not
so
susannah
i
never
laugh
when
i
know
people
are
sincere
it
appears
to
me
then
to
be
a
vanity
fair
that
there
is
more
vanity
in
london
than
in
any
other
city
i
grant
replied
i
but
recollect
that
there
are
more
people
and
more
wealth
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
more
in
proportion
than
in
other
towns
in
england
and
if
there
is
more
vanity
susannah
recollect
also
that
there
is
more
industry
more
talent
and
i
should
hope
a
greater
proportion
of
good
and
honest
people
among
its
multitudes
there
is
also
unfortunately
more
misery
and
more
crime
i
believe
you
are
right
japhet
are
you
aware
that
mr
cophagus
has
put
off
his
plain
attire
if
it
grieves
you
susannah
it
grieves
me
also
but
i
presume
he
finds
it
necessary
not
to
be
so
remarkable
for
him
i
could
find
some
excuse
but
what
will
you
say
japhet
when
i
tell
you
that
my
own
sister
born
and
bred
up
to
our
tenets
hath
also
much
deviated
from
the
dress
of
the
females
of
our
sect
in
what
hath
she
made
an
alteration
she
has
a
bonnet
of
plaited
straw
with
ribands
of
what
colour
are
the
ribands
nay
of
the
same
as
her
dress
of
grey
your
bonnet
susannah
is
of
grey
silk
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
vanity
in
descending
to
straw
which
is
a
more
homely
commodity
but
what
reason
has
she
given
that
her
husband
wills
it
as
he
does
not
like
to
walk
out
with
her
in
her
quaker
dress
is
it
not
her
duty
to
obey
her
husband
even
as
i
obey
my
father
susannah
but
i
am
not
ashamed
to
walk
out
with
you
in
your
dress
so
if
you
have
no
objection
let
me
show
you
a
part
of
this
great
city
susannah
consented
we
had
often
walked
together
in
the
town
of
reading
she
was
evidently
pleased
at
what
i
said
i
soon
escorted
her
to
from
thence
down
bond
street
and
through
all
the
most
frequented
parts
of
the
metropolis
the
dress
naturally
drew
upon
her
the
casual
glance
of
the
passengers
but
her
extreme
beauty
turned
the
glance
to
an
ardent
gaze
and
long
before
we
had
finished
our
intended
walk
susannah
requested
that
i
would
go
home
she
was
not
only
annoyed
but
almost
alarmed
at
the
constant
and
reiterated
scrutiny
which
she
underwent
ascribing
it
to
her
dress
and
not
to
her
lovely
person
as
soon
as
we
returned
i
sat
down
with
her
so
i
understand
that
mr
cophagus
intends
to
reside
altogether
in
london
i
have
not
heard
so
i
understood
that
it
was
business
which
called
him
hither
for
a
few
weeks
i
trust
not
for
i
shall
be
unhappy
here
may
i
ask
why
the
people
are
rude
it
is
not
agreeable
to
walk
out
recollect
my
dear
susannah
that
those
of
your
sect
are
not
so
plentiful
in
london
as
elsewhere
and
if
you
wear
a
dress
so
different
from
other
people
you
must
expect
that
curiosity
will
be
excited
you
can
not
blame
them
it
is
you
who
make
yourself
conspicuous
almost
saying
to
the
people
by
your
garment
and
look
at
me
i
have
been
reflecting
upon
what
mr
masterton
said
to
you
at
reading
and
i
do
not
know
whether
he
was
not
right
in
calling
it
a
garb
of
pride
instead
of
a
garb
of
humility
if
i
thought
so
japhet
even
i
would
throw
it
off
replied
susannah
it
certainly
is
not
pleasant
that
everyone
should
think
that
you
walk
out
on
purpose
to
be
stared
at
yet
such
is
the
construction
of
the
world
and
they
will
never
believe
otherwise
it
is
possible
i
should
think
to
dress
with
equal
simplicity
and
neatness
to
avoid
gay
colours
and
yet
to
dress
so
as
not
to
excite
observation
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
but
that
you
all
appear
against
me
and
that
sometimes
i
feel
that
i
am
too
presumptuous
in
thus
judging
for
myself
i
am
not
against
you
susannah
i
know
you
will
do
what
you
think
is
right
and
i
shall
respect
you
for
that
even
if
i
disagree
with
you
but
i
must
say
that
if
my
wife
were
to
dress
in
such
a
way
as
to
attract
the
public
gaze
i
should
feel
too
jealous
to
approve
of
it
i
do
not
therefore
blame
mr
cophagus
for
inducing
his
pretty
wife
to
make
some
alteration
in
her
attire
neither
do
i
blame
but
i
commend
her
for
obeying
the
wishes
of
her
husband
her
beauty
is
his
and
not
common
property
susannah
did
not
reply
she
appeared
very
thoughtful
you
disagree
with
me
susannah
said
i
after
a
pause
i
am
sorry
for
it
i
can
not
say
that
i
do
japhet
i
have
learnt
a
lesson
this
day
and
in
future
i
must
think
more
humbly
of
myself
and
be
more
ruled
by
the
opinions
and
judgment
of
others
mr
and
mrs
cophagus
then
came
in
cophagus
had
resumed
his
medical
coat
and
waistcoat
but
not
his
pantaloons
or
hessians
his
wife
who
had
a
very
good
taste
in
dress
would
not
allow
him
she
was
in
her
grey
silk
gown
but
wore
a
large
handsome
shawl
which
covered
all
but
the
skirts
on
her
head
she
had
a
leghorn
bonnet
and
certainly
looked
very
pretty
as
usual
she
was
all
good
humour
and
smiles
i
told
them
that
we
had
been
walking
out
and
that
susannah
had
been
much
annoyed
by
the
staring
of
the
people
always
so
said
cophagus
never
mind
girls
like
it
feel
pleased
and
so
on
you
wrong
me
much
brother
cophagus
replied
susannah
it
pained
me
exceedingly
all
very
well
to
say
so
know
better
sly
puss
will
wear
dress
people
say
pretty
quaker
and
so
on
susannah
hastily
left
the
room
after
this
attack
and
i
told
them
what
had
passed
mrs
cophagus
said
i
order
a
bonnet
and
shawl
like
yours
for
her
without
telling
her
and
perhaps
you
will
persuade
her
to
put
them
on
mrs
cophagus
thought
the
idea
excellent
and
promised
to
procure
them
susannah
not
making
her
i
took
leave
and
arrived
at
the
hotel
in
good
time
for
dinner
japhet
said
the
general
to
me
as
we
were
at
table
you
have
mentioned
lord
windermear
very
often
have
you
called
upon
him
lately
no
sir
it
is
now
two
years
and
more
since
i
have
seen
him
when
i
was
summoned
to
town
to
meet
you
i
was
too
much
agitated
to
think
of
anything
else
and
since
that
i
have
had
too
much
pleasure
in
your
company
say
rather
my
good
boy
that
you
have
nursed
me
so
carefully
that
you
have
neglected
your
friends
and
your
health
take
my
carriage
and
call
upon
him
and
after
that
you
had
better
drive
about
a
little
for
you
have
been
looking
pale
these
last
few
days
i
hope
to
get
out
myself
in
a
short
time
and
then
we
will
have
plenty
of
amusement
together
in
setting
up
our
establishment
part
three
chapter
twenty
two
i
renew
old
ties
of
friendship
and
seek
new
ones
of
love
obliged
to
take
my
father
to
task
once
more
he
receives
his
lesson
with
proper
obedience
i
took
the
carriage
the
next
day
and
drove
to
lord
windermear
he
was
at
home
and
i
gave
my
name
to
the
servant
as
mr
de
benyon
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
made
use
of
my
own
name
his
lordship
was
alone
when
i
entered
he
bowed
as
if
not
recognising
me
and
waved
his
hand
to
a
chair
my
lord
i
have
given
my
true
name
and
you
treat
me
as
a
perfect
stranger
i
will
mention
my
name
and
i
trust
you
will
honour
me
with
a
recognition
i
was
japhet
newland
my
dear
mr
newland
you
must
accept
my
apology
but
it
is
so
long
since
we
met
and
i
did
not
expect
to
see
you
again
i
thought
my
lord
that
mr
masterton
had
informed
you
of
what
had
taken
place
no
i
have
just
come
from
a
visit
to
my
sisters
in
westmoreland
and
have
received
no
letters
from
him
i
have
my
lord
at
last
succeeded
in
finding
out
the
object
of
my
mad
search
as
you
were
truly
pleased
to
call
it
in
the
honourable
general
de
benyon
lately
arrived
from
the
east
indies
where
his
services
are
well
known
added
his
lordship
mr
de
benyon
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
when
you
refused
my
offers
of
assistance
and
left
us
all
in
that
mad
way
i
certainly
despaired
of
ever
seeing
you
again
i
am
glad
that
you
under
such
fortunate
auspices
has
your
father
any
family
none
my
lord
but
myself
and
my
mother
died
in
the
east
indies
then
i
presume
from
what
i
know
at
the
board
of
control
that
you
may
safely
be
introduced
as
a
young
gentleman
of
large
fortune
allow
me
at
least
to
assist
your
father
in
placing
you
in
your
proper
sphere
in
society
where
is
your
father
at
present
my
lord
he
is
staying
at
the
adelphi
hotel
confined
to
his
room
by
an
accident
but
i
trust
that
in
a
few
days
he
will
be
able
to
come
out
will
you
offer
my
congratulations
to
him
and
tell
him
that
if
he
will
allow
me
i
will
have
the
honour
of
paying
my
respects
to
him
will
you
dine
with
me
on
monday
next
i
returned
my
thanks
accepted
the
invitation
and
took
my
leave
his
lordship
saying
as
he
shook
hands
with
me
you
do
know
how
happy
this
intelligence
has
made
me
i
trust
that
your
father
and
i
shall
be
good
friends
when
i
returned
to
the
carriage
as
my
father
had
desired
me
to
take
an
airing
i
thought
i
might
as
well
have
a
companion
so
i
directed
them
to
drive
to
mr
cophagus
the
servant
knocked
and
i
went
in
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
susannah
and
mrs
cophagus
were
sitting
in
the
room
susannah
said
i
i
know
you
do
not
like
to
walk
out
so
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
have
no
objection
to
take
an
airing
in
the
carriage
my
father
has
lent
it
to
me
will
you
come
it
will
do
you
good
it
is
very
kind
of
you
japhet
to
think
of
me
but
but
what
replied
mrs
cophagus
surely
thou
wilt
not
refuse
susannah
it
would
savour
much
of
ingratitude
on
thy
part
i
will
not
then
be
ungrateful
replied
susannah
leaving
the
room
and
in
a
short
time
she
returned
in
a
leghorn
bonnet
and
shawl
like
her
sister
do
not
i
prove
that
i
am
not
ungrateful
japhet
since
to
do
credit
to
thy
carriage
i
am
content
to
depart
from
the
rules
of
our
persuasion
said
susannah
smiling
i
feel
the
kindness
and
the
sacrifice
you
are
making
to
please
me
susannah
replied
i
but
let
us
lose
no
time
i
handed
her
down
to
the
carriage
and
we
drove
to
the
park
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
the
park
was
filled
with
pedestrians
as
well
as
carriages
susannah
was
much
astonished
as
well
as
pleased
now
susannah
said
i
if
you
were
to
call
this
vanity
fair
you
would
not
be
far
wrong
but
still
recollect
that
even
all
this
is
productive
of
much
good
reflect
how
many
industrious
people
find
employment
and
provision
for
their
families
by
the
building
of
these
gay
vehicles
their
painting
and
ornamenting
how
many
are
employed
at
the
loom
and
at
the
needle
in
making
these
costly
dresses
this
vanity
is
the
cause
of
wealth
not
being
hoarded
but
finding
its
way
through
various
channels
so
as
to
produce
comfort
and
happiness
to
thousands
your
observations
are
just
japhet
but
you
have
lived
in
the
world
and
seen
much
of
it
i
am
as
one
just
burst
from
an
all
amazement
i
have
been
living
in
a
little
world
of
my
own
thoughts
surrounded
by
a
mist
of
ignorance
and
not
being
able
to
penetrate
farther
have
considered
myself
wise
when
i
was
not
my
dear
susannah
this
is
a
checkered
world
but
not
a
very
bad
one
there
is
in
it
much
of
good
as
well
as
evil
the
sect
to
which
you
belong
avoid
it
they
know
it
not
and
they
are
unjust
towards
it
during
the
time
that
i
lived
at
reading
i
will
candidly
state
to
you
that
i
met
with
many
who
called
themselves
of
the
persuasion
who
were
wholly
unworthy
of
it
but
they
made
up
in
outward
appearance
and
hypocrisy
what
they
wanted
in
their
conduct
to
their
fellow
creatures
believe
me
susannah
there
are
pious
and
good
charitable
and
humane
conscientious
and
strictly
honourable
people
among
those
who
now
pass
before
your
view
in
such
gay
procession
but
society
requires
that
the
rich
should
spend
their
money
in
superfluities
that
the
poor
may
be
supported
be
not
deceived
therefore
in
future
by
the
outward
garments
which
avail
nothing
you
have
induced
me
much
to
alter
my
opinions
already
japhet
so
has
that
pleasant
friend
of
thine
mr
masterton
who
has
twice
called
since
we
have
been
in
london
but
is
it
not
time
that
we
should
return
it
is
indeed
later
than
i
thought
it
was
susannah
lied
i
looking
at
my
watch
and
i
am
afraid
that
my
father
will
be
impatient
for
my
return
i
will
order
them
to
drive
home
as
we
drove
along
leaning
against
the
back
of
the
carriage
my
hand
happened
to
touch
that
of
susannah
which
lay
beside
her
on
the
cushion
i
could
not
resist
taking
it
in
mine
and
it
was
not
withdrawn
what
my
thoughts
were
the
reader
may
imagine
susannah
i
can
not
acquaint
him
with
but
in
that
position
we
remained
in
silence
until
the
carriage
stopped
at
cophagus
door
i
handed
susannah
out
of
the
carriage
and
went
up
stairs
for
a
few
moments
mrs
cophagus
and
her
husband
were
out
susannah
this
is
very
kind
of
you
and
i
return
you
my
thanks
i
never
felt
more
happy
than
when
seated
with
you
in
that
carriage
i
have
received
both
amusement
and
instruction
japhet
and
ought
to
thank
you
do
you
know
what
passed
in
my
mind
at
one
time
no
tell
me
when
i
first
knew
you
and
you
came
among
us
i
was
as
it
were
the
guide
a
presumptuous
one
perhaps
to
you
and
you
listened
to
me
now
it
is
reversed
now
that
we
are
removed
and
in
the
world
it
is
you
that
are
the
guide
and
it
is
i
who
listen
and
obey
because
susannah
when
we
first
met
i
was
much
in
error
and
had
thought
too
little
of
serious
things
and
you
were
fit
to
be
my
guide
now
we
are
mixing
in
the
world
with
which
i
am
better
acquainted
than
yourself
you
then
corrected
me
when
i
was
wrong
i
now
point
out
to
you
where
you
are
not
rightly
informed
but
susannah
what
you
have
learnt
of
me
is
as
nought
compared
with
the
valuable
precepts
which
i
gained
from
your
lips
precepts
which
i
trust
no
collision
with
the
world
will
ever
make
me
forget
oh
i
love
to
hear
you
say
that
i
was
fearful
that
the
world
would
spoil
you
japhet
but
it
will
not
will
it
not
so
long
as
i
have
you
still
with
me
susannah
but
if
i
am
obliged
to
mix
again
with
the
world
tell
me
susannah
will
you
reject
me
will
you
desert
me
will
you
return
to
your
own
people
and
leave
me
so
exposed
susannah
dearest
you
must
know
how
long
how
dearly
i
have
loved
you
you
know
that
if
i
had
not
been
sent
for
and
obliged
to
obey
the
message
i
would
have
lived
and
died
content
with
you
will
you
not
listen
to
me
now
or
do
you
reject
me
i
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
her
head
fell
upon
my
shoulder
and
she
burst
into
tears
speak
dearest
this
suspense
is
torture
to
me
continued
i
i
do
love
you
japhet
replied
she
at
last
looking
fondly
at
me
through
her
tears
but
i
know
not
whether
this
earthly
love
may
not
have
weakened
my
affection
towards
heaven
if
so
may
god
pardon
me
for
i
can
not
help
it
after
this
avowal
for
a
few
minutes
which
appeared
seconds
we
were
in
each
other
arms
when
susannah
disengaged
herself
dearest
japhet
thy
father
will
be
much
displeased
i
can
not
help
it
replied
i
i
shall
submit
to
his
displeasure
nay
but
japhet
why
risk
thy
father
wrath
well
then
replied
i
attempting
to
reach
her
lips
i
will
go
nay
nay
indeed
japhet
you
exact
too
much
it
is
not
seemly
then
i
wo
go
recollect
about
thy
father
it
is
you
who
detain
me
susannah
i
must
not
injure
thee
with
thy
father
japhet
it
were
no
proof
of
my
affection
but
indeed
you
are
god
bless
you
susannah
said
i
as
i
gained
the
contested
point
and
hastened
to
the
carriage
my
father
was
a
little
out
of
humour
when
i
returned
and
questioned
me
rather
sharply
as
to
where
i
had
been
i
half
pacified
him
by
delivering
lord
windermear
polite
message
but
he
continued
his
interrogations
and
although
i
had
pointed
out
to
him
that
a
de
benyon
would
never
be
guilty
of
an
untruth
i
am
afraid
i
told
some
half
dozen
on
this
occasion
but
i
consoled
myself
with
the
reflection
that
in
the
code
of
honour
of
a
fashionable
man
he
is
bound
if
necessary
to
tell
falsehoods
where
a
lady
is
concerned
so
i
said
i
had
driven
through
the
streets
looking
at
the
houses
and
had
twice
stopped
and
had
gone
in
to
examine
them
my
father
supposed
that
i
had
been
looking
out
for
a
house
for
him
and
was
satisfied
fortunately
they
were
job
horses
had
they
been
his
own
i
should
have
been
in
a
severe
scrape
horses
are
the
only
part
of
an
establishment
for
which
the
gentlemen
have
any
consideration
and
on
which
ladies
have
no
mercy
i
had
promised
the
next
day
to
dine
with
mr
masterton
my
father
had
taken
a
great
aversion
to
this
old
gentleman
until
i
had
narrated
the
events
of
my
life
in
which
he
had
played
such
a
conspicuous
and
friendly
part
then
to
do
my
father
justice
his
heart
warmed
towards
him
my
dear
sir
i
have
promised
to
dine
out
with
whom
japhet
why
sir
to
tell
you
the
truth
with
that
thief
of
a
lawyer
i
am
very
much
shocked
at
your
using
such
an
expression
towards
one
who
has
been
such
a
sincere
friend
japhet
and
you
will
oblige
me
sir
by
not
doing
so
again
in
my
presence
i
really
beg
your
pardon
general
replied
i
but
i
thought
to
please
you
please
me
what
do
you
think
of
me
please
me
sir
by
showing
yourself
ungrateful
i
am
ashamed
of
you
sir
my
dear
father
i
borrowed
the
expression
from
you
you
called
mr
masterton
old
thief
of
a
lawyer
to
his
face
he
complained
to
me
of
the
language
before
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
i
feel
and
always
shall
feel
the
highest
respect
love
and
gratitude
towards
him
have
i
your
permission
to
go
yes
japhet
replied
my
father
looking
very
grave
and
do
me
the
favour
to
apologise
for
me
to
mr
masterton
for
my
having
used
such
an
expression
in
my
unfortunate
warmth
of
temper
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
my
dearest
father
no
man
need
be
ashamed
who
is
so
ready
to
make
honourable
reparation
we
are
all
a
little
out
of
temper
at
times
you
have
been
a
kind
friend
to
me
japhet
as
well
as
a
good
son
replied
my
father
with
some
emotion
do
forget
the
apology
at
all
events
i
shall
be
unhappy
until
it
be
made
part
three
chapter
twenty
three
treats
of
apologies
and
love
coming
from
church
we
finesse
with
the
nabob
to
win
me
a
wife
i
am
successful
in
my
suit
yet
the
lawyer
is
still
to
play
the
cards
to
enable
me
to
win
the
game
i
arrived
at
mr
masterton
and
walked
into
his
room
when
whom
should
i
find
in
company
with
him
but
harcourt
japhet
i
glad
to
see
you
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
mr
harcourt
mr
de
benyon
and
the
old
gentleman
grinned
maliciously
but
i
was
not
to
be
taken
aback
harcourt
said
i
extending
my
hand
i
have
to
apologise
to
you
for
a
rude
reception
and
for
unjust
suspicions
but
i
was
vexed
at
the
time
if
you
will
admit
that
as
an
excuse
my
dear
japhet
replied
harcourt
taking
my
hand
and
shaking
it
warmly
i
have
to
apologise
to
you
for
much
more
unworthy
behaviour
and
it
will
be
a
great
relief
to
my
mind
if
you
will
once
more
enrol
me
in
the
list
of
your
friends
and
now
mr
masterton
said
i
as
apologies
appear
to
be
the
order
of
the
day
i
bring
you
one
from
the
general
who
has
requested
me
to
make
one
to
you
for
having
called
you
old
thief
of
a
lawyer
of
which
he
was
totally
ignorant
until
i
reminded
him
of
it
harcourt
burst
into
a
laugh
well
japhet
you
may
tell
your
old
tiger
that
i
did
not
feel
particularly
affronted
as
i
took
his
expression
and
not
personally
and
if
he
meant
it
in
that
sense
he
was
not
far
wrong
japhet
is
sunday
do
you
go
to
meeting
or
to
church
i
believe
sir
that
i
shall
go
to
church
well
then
come
with
me
be
here
at
two
we
will
go
to
evening
service
at
saint
james
i
have
received
many
invitations
but
i
never
yet
received
an
invitation
to
go
to
church
replied
i
you
will
hear
an
extra
lesson
of
the
day
a
portion
of
susannah
and
the
elders
i
took
the
equivoque
which
was
incomprehensible
to
harcourt
i
hardly
need
say
that
the
latter
and
i
were
on
the
best
terms
when
we
separated
harcourt
requested
leave
to
call
upon
me
the
next
morning
and
mr
masterton
said
that
he
should
also
pay
his
respects
to
the
tiger
as
he
invariably
called
my
most
honoured
parent
harcourt
was
with
me
very
soon
after
breakfast
and
after
i
had
introduced
him
to
my
governor
we
retired
to
talk
without
interruption
i
have
much
to
say
to
you
de
benyon
commenced
harcourt
first
let
me
tell
you
that
after
i
rose
from
my
bed
and
discovered
that
you
had
disappeared
i
resolved
if
possible
to
find
you
out
and
induce
you
to
come
back
timothy
who
looked
very
sly
at
me
would
tell
me
nothing
but
that
the
last
that
was
heard
of
you
was
at
lady
de
clare
at
richmond
having
no
other
clue
i
went
down
there
introduced
myself
and
as
they
will
tell
you
candidly
acknowledged
that
i
had
treated
you
ill
i
then
requested
that
they
would
give
me
any
clue
by
which
you
might
be
found
for
i
had
an
opportunity
of
offering
to
you
a
situation
which
was
at
my
father
disposal
and
which
any
gentlemen
might
have
accepted
although
it
was
not
very
lucrative
it
was
very
kind
of
you
harcourt
do
not
say
that
i
beg
it
was
thus
that
i
formed
an
acquaintance
with
lady
de
clare
and
her
daughter
whose
early
history
as
fleta
i
had
obtained
from
you
but
who
i
little
imagined
to
be
the
little
girl
that
you
had
so
generously
protected
for
it
was
not
until
after
i
had
deserted
you
that
you
had
discovered
her
parentage
the
extreme
interest
relative
to
you
evinced
by
both
the
mother
and
the
daughter
surprised
me
they
had
heard
of
my
name
from
you
but
not
of
our
quarrel
they
urged
me
and
thanked
me
for
proposing
to
follow
you
and
find
you
out
i
did
make
every
attempt
i
went
to
brentford
inquired
at
all
the
and
of
all
the
coachmen
who
went
down
the
road
but
could
obtain
no
information
except
that
at
one
a
gentleman
stopped
with
a
portmanteau
and
soon
afterwards
went
away
with
it
on
his
shoulders
i
returned
to
richmond
with
the
tidings
of
my
about
a
week
after
i
had
first
called
there
cecilia
was
much
affected
and
cried
very
bitterly
i
could
not
help
asking
lady
de
clare
why
she
took
such
a
strong
interest
in
your
fortunes
ought
replied
cecilia
his
poor
fleta
does
not
heavens
miss
de
clare
are
you
the
little
fleta
whom
he
found
with
the
gipsies
and
talked
to
me
so
much
about
you
not
know
it
said
lady
de
clare
i
then
explained
to
her
all
that
had
latterly
passed
between
us
and
they
in
return
communicated
your
events
and
dangers
in
ireland
thus
was
an
intimacy
formed
and
ever
since
i
have
been
constantly
welcome
at
their
house
i
did
not
however
abandon
my
inquiries
for
many
months
when
i
thought
it
was
useless
and
i
had
to
console
poor
cecilia
who
constantly
mourned
for
you
and
now
japhet
i
must
make
my
story
short
i
could
not
help
admiring
a
young
person
who
showed
so
much
attachment
and
gratitude
joined
to
such
personal
attractions
but
she
was
an
heiress
and
i
was
a
younger
brother
still
lady
de
clare
insisted
upon
my
coming
to
the
house
and
i
was
undecided
how
to
act
when
the
unfortunate
death
of
my
elder
brother
put
me
in
a
situation
to
aspire
to
her
hand
after
that
my
visits
were
more
frequent
and
i
was
tacitly
received
as
a
suitor
by
lady
de
clare
and
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
the
treatment
i
received
from
cecilia
such
was
the
position
of
affairs
until
the
day
on
which
you
broke
in
upon
us
so
unexpectedly
and
at
the
very
moment
that
you
came
in
i
had
with
the
sanction
of
her
mother
made
an
offer
to
cecilia
and
was
anxiously
awaiting
an
answer
from
her
own
dear
lips
can
you
therefore
be
surprised
japhet
at
there
being
a
degree
of
constraint
on
all
sides
at
the
interruption
occasioned
by
the
presence
of
one
who
had
long
been
considered
lost
to
us
or
that
a
young
person
just
deciding
upon
the
most
important
step
of
her
life
should
feel
confused
and
agitated
at
the
entrance
of
a
third
party
however
dear
he
might
be
to
her
as
a
brother
and
benefactor
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
harcourt
replied
i
and
i
will
go
there
and
make
my
peace
as
soon
as
i
can
indeed
japhet
if
you
knew
the
distress
of
cecilia
you
would
pity
and
love
her
more
than
ever
her
mother
is
also
much
annoyed
as
soon
as
you
were
gone
they
desired
me
to
hasten
after
you
and
bring
you
back
cecilia
had
not
yet
given
her
answer
i
requested
it
before
my
departure
but
i
presume
to
stimulate
me
she
declared
that
she
would
give
me
no
answer
until
i
with
you
this
is
now
three
weeks
ago
and
i
have
not
dared
to
go
there
i
have
been
trying
all
i
can
to
see
you
again
since
you
repulsed
me
at
the
piazza
but
without
success
until
i
went
to
mr
masterton
and
begged
him
to
procure
me
an
interview
i
thank
god
it
has
succeeded
well
harcourt
you
shall
see
cecilia
morning
if
you
please
japhet
what
obligations
i
am
under
to
you
had
it
not
been
for
you
i
never
should
have
known
cecilia
and
more
were
it
not
for
your
kindness
i
might
perhaps
lose
her
for
ever
not
so
harcourt
it
was
your
own
good
feeling
prompting
you
to
find
me
out
which
introduced
you
to
cecilia
and
i
wish
you
joy
with
all
my
heart
this
is
a
strange
world
who
would
have
imagined
that
in
little
fleta
i
was
picking
up
a
wife
for
a
man
whose
life
i
nearly
took
away
i
will
ask
my
for
his
carriage
and
will
call
and
take
you
up
at
your
lodgings
at
two
if
that
hour
will
suit
you
i
will
tell
you
all
that
has
passed
since
i
absconded
when
we
are
at
lady
de
clare
one
story
will
do
for
all
harcourt
then
took
his
leave
and
i
returned
to
my
father
with
whom
i
found
lord
windermear
de
benyon
i
am
happy
to
see
you
again
said
his
lordship
i
have
just
been
giving
a
very
good
character
of
you
to
the
general
i
hope
you
will
continue
to
deserve
it
i
hope
so
too
my
lord
i
should
be
ungrateful
indeed
if
i
did
not
after
my
father
kindness
to
me
mr
masterton
was
then
introduced
lord
windermear
shook
hands
with
him
and
after
a
short
conversation
took
his
leave
japhet
said
mr
masterton
aside
i
have
a
little
business
with
your
father
get
out
of
the
room
any
way
you
think
best
there
are
but
two
ways
my
dear
sir
replied
i
the
door
or
the
windows
with
your
permission
i
will
select
the
former
as
most
agreeable
so
saying
i
went
to
my
own
room
what
passed
between
the
general
and
mr
masterton
i
did
not
know
until
afterwards
but
they
were
closeted
upwards
of
an
hour
when
i
was
sent
for
by
mr
masterton
japhet
you
said
you
would
go
with
me
to
hear
the
new
preacher
we
have
no
time
to
lose
so
general
i
shall
take
my
leave
and
run
away
with
your
son
i
followed
mr
masterton
into
his
carriage
and
we
drove
to
the
lodging
of
mr
cophagus
susannah
was
all
ready
and
mr
masterton
went
up
stairs
and
brought
her
down
a
blush
and
a
sweet
smile
illumined
her
features
when
she
perceived
me
stowed
away
in
the
corner
of
the
chariot
we
drove
off
and
somehow
or
another
our
hands
again
met
and
did
not
separate
until
we
arrived
at
the
church
door
susannah
had
the
same
dress
on
as
when
she
had
accompanied
me
in
my
father
carriage
i
went
through
the
responses
with
her
reading
out
of
the
same
book
and
i
never
felt
more
inclined
to
be
devout
for
i
was
happy
and
grateful
to
heaven
for
my
happiness
when
the
service
was
over
we
were
about
to
enter
the
carriage
when
who
should
accost
us
but
harcourt
you
are
surprised
to
see
me
here
said
he
to
mr
masterton
but
i
thought
there
must
be
something
very
attractive
that
you
should
make
an
appointment
with
japhet
to
go
to
this
church
and
as
i
am
very
fond
of
a
good
sermon
i
determined
to
come
and
hear
it
harcourt
ironical
look
told
me
all
he
would
say
well
replied
mr
masterton
i
hope
you
have
been
edified
now
get
out
of
the
way
and
let
us
go
into
the
carriage
at
two
de
benyon
said
harcourt
taking
another
peep
at
susannah
yes
punctually
replied
i
as
the
carriage
drove
off
and
now
my
dear
child
said
mr
masterton
to
susannah
as
the
carriage
rolled
along
tell
me
have
you
been
disappointed
or
do
you
agree
with
me
you
have
attended
a
meeting
of
your
own
persuasion
this
morning
you
have
now
for
the
first
time
listened
to
the
ritual
of
the
established
church
to
which
do
you
give
the
preference
i
will
not
deny
sir
that
i
think
in
departing
from
the
forms
of
worship
those
of
my
persuasion
did
not
do
wisely
i
would
not
venture
thus
much
to
say
but
you
support
me
in
my
judgment
you
have
answered
like
a
good
sensible
girl
and
have
proved
that
you
can
think
for
yourself
but
observe
my
child
i
have
persuaded
you
for
once
and
once
only
to
enter
our
place
of
worship
that
you
might
compare
and
judge
for
yourself
it
now
remains
for
you
to
decide
as
you
please
i
would
that
some
better
qualified
would
decide
for
me
replied
susannah
gravely
your
husband
susannah
whispered
i
must
take
that
responsibility
upon
himself
is
he
not
the
proper
person
susannah
slightly
pressed
my
hand
which
held
hers
and
said
nothing
as
soon
as
we
had
conveyed
her
home
mr
masterton
offered
to
do
me
the
same
kindness
which
i
accepted
now
japhet
i
dare
say
that
you
would
like
to
know
what
it
was
i
had
so
particular
to
say
to
the
old
general
this
morning
of
course
i
would
sir
if
it
concerned
me
it
did
concern
you
for
we
had
not
been
two
minutes
in
conversation
before
you
were
brought
on
the
tapis
he
spoke
of
you
with
tears
in
his
eyes
of
what
a
comfort
you
had
been
to
him
and
how
happy
you
had
made
him
and
that
he
could
not
bear
you
to
be
away
from
him
for
half
an
hour
on
that
hint
i
spake
and
observed
that
he
must
not
expect
you
to
continue
in
retirement
long
neither
must
he
blame
you
that
when
he
had
set
up
his
establishment
you
would
be
as
great
a
favourite
as
you
were
before
and
be
unable
without
giving
offence
to
refuse
the
numerous
invitations
which
you
would
receive
in
short
that
it
was
nothing
but
right
you
should
resume
your
position
in
society
and
it
was
his
duty
to
submit
to
it
the
did
not
appear
to
like
my
observations
and
said
he
expected
otherwise
from
you
i
replied
it
was
impossible
to
change
our
natures
and
the
other
sex
would
naturally
have
attractions
which
you
would
not
be
able
to
resist
and
that
they
would
occupy
a
large
portion
of
your
time
the
only
way
to
insure
his
company
my
dear
sir
is
marry
him
to
a
steady
amiable
young
woman
who
not
having
been
thrown
into
the
vortex
of
fashion
will
find
pleasure
in
domestic
life
then
her
husband
will
become
equally
domestic
and
you
will
be
all
very
happy
together
your
father
agreed
with
me
and
appeared
very
anxious
that
it
should
take
place
i
then
very
carefully
introduced
miss
temple
saying
that
i
knew
you
had
a
slight
partiality
in
that
quarter
highly
commending
her
beauty
prudence
etcetera
i
stated
that
feeling
an
interest
about
you
i
had
gone
down
into
the
country
where
she
resided
and
had
made
her
acquaintance
and
had
been
much
pleased
with
her
that
since
she
had
come
up
to
town
with
her
relations
i
had
seen
a
great
deal
and
had
formed
so
high
an
opinion
of
and
so
strong
an
attachment
to
her
and
had
felt
so
convinced
that
she
was
the
very
person
who
would
make
you
happy
and
domestic
that
having
no
family
myself
i
had
some
idea
of
adopting
her
at
all
events
that
if
she
married
you
i
was
determined
to
give
her
something
very
handsome
on
the
day
of
the
wedding
but
my
dear
sir
why
should
you
not
have
said
that
susannah
temple
was
left
an
orphan
at
seven
years
old
and
her
fortune
has
accumulated
ever
since
it
is
by
no
means
despicable
i
understand
from
mr
cophagus
and
moreover
mr
cophagus
intends
to
leave
her
all
his
property
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
japhet
and
will
not
fail
to
communicate
all
this
to
your
father
but
there
is
no
reason
why
i
may
not
do
as
i
please
with
my
own
money
and
i
love
that
girl
dearly
have
you
ever
said
anything
to
her
o
yes
sir
we
are
pledged
to
each
other
that
all
right
i
thought
so
when
i
saw
your
fingers
hooked
together
in
the
carriage
but
now
japhet
i
should
recommend
a
little
indifference
not
exactly
opposition
when
your
father
proposes
the
subject
to
you
it
will
make
him
more
anxious
and
when
you
consent
more
obliged
to
you
i
have
promised
to
call
upon
him
on
that
and
other
business
and
you
had
better
be
out
of
the
way
i
shall
be
out
of
the
way
sir
i
mean
to
go
with
harcourt
to
lady
de
clare
i
shall
ask
for
the
carriage
he
will
certainly
lend
it
to
you
as
he
wishes
to
get
rid
of
you
but
here
we
are
god
bless
you
my
boy
part
three
chapter
twenty
four
the
bengal
tiger
taken
in
the
toils
which
promise
a
speedy
end
to
mine
i
kindly
permit
my
father
to
insist
upon
the
marriage
that
i
have
set
my
heart
upon
i
found
my
father
who
had
now
completely
recovered
from
his
accident
walking
up
and
down
the
room
in
a
brown
study
he
did
not
speak
to
me
until
after
dinner
when
he
commenced
with
asking
some
questions
relative
to
cecilia
de
clare
i
replied
that
i
intended
if
he
did
not
want
the
carriage
to
call
there
with
mr
harcourt
is
she
very
handsome
inquired
he
very
much
so
sir
i
do
not
think
i
ever
saw
a
handsomer
young
person
yes
i
do
recollect
one
who
was
that
a
young
lady
with
whom
i
was
slightly
acquainted
when
living
in
the
country
i
have
been
thinking
my
dear
boy
that
with
the
competence
which
you
will
have
it
is
right
that
you
should
marry
early
in
so
doing
you
will
oblige
your
father
who
is
anxious
to
see
his
grandchildren
before
he
dies
my
health
is
not
very
good
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
this
pathetic
touch
of
the
old
who
if
one
could
judge
from
appearances
was
as
strong
as
a
lion
and
likely
to
last
almost
as
long
as
his
dutiful
son
moreover
his
appetite
was
enormous
and
he
invariably
finished
his
bottle
every
day
i
did
not
therefore
feel
any
serious
alarm
as
to
his
health
but
i
nevertheless
replied
matrimony
is
a
subject
upon
which
i
have
never
thought
ahem
a
de
benyon
never
tells
an
untruth
i
am
very
young
yet
and
am
too
happy
to
remain
with
you
but
my
dear
boy
i
propose
that
you
shall
remain
with
me
we
will
all
live
together
i
do
not
intend
that
we
shall
part
i
really
wish
japhet
you
would
think
seriously
of
it
my
dear
father
allow
me
to
observe
that
at
present
i
am
not
in
a
situation
to
support
a
wife
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
be
a
tax
upon
you
at
your
age
you
require
many
comforts
and
luxuries
and
i
presume
that
you
live
up
to
your
income
then
my
dear
fellow
you
are
under
a
great
mistake
i
can
lay
down
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
on
the
day
of
your
marriage
with
any
lady
whom
i
approve
of
and
still
not
spend
half
my
remaining
income
that
sir
replied
i
certainly
removes
one
difficulty
at
the
same
time
that
it
proves
what
a
generous
and
indulgent
father
i
am
blessed
with
but
sir
with
such
a
fortune
i
have
a
right
to
expect
that
the
lady
will
also
bring
a
handsome
addition
miss
de
clare
is
engaged
i
believe
to
mr
harcourt
or
i
might
have
made
strong
interest
in
that
quarter
something
my
dear
boy
but
a
moderate
fortune
is
all
that
we
expect
with
wives
and
the
best
wives
are
those
who
are
not
born
to
too
much
wealth
still
she
should
bring
something
but
tell
me
japhet
who
is
that
young
lady
whom
you
thought
handsomer
than
miss
de
clare
a
miss
temple
sir
temple
it
is
a
very
good
name
i
think
girls
brought
up
in
the
country
make
the
best
wives
they
do
sir
most
certainly
they
are
more
domestic
and
make
their
husbands
more
content
and
happy
at
home
well
my
dear
boy
i
have
mentioned
the
subject
and
wish
you
would
think
of
it
you
will
please
me
much
my
dear
father
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
obey
in
everything
else
but
in
so
serious
a
point
as
uniting
myself
for
life
i
think
you
must
allow
that
a
little
discretionary
power
should
be
given
to
a
son
all
i
can
say
is
this
show
me
a
young
person
who
is
eligible
and
if
i
find
that
i
can
love
her
i
will
not
refuse
to
obey
your
wishes
well
sir
do
as
you
please
replied
my
father
very
angrily
but
i
think
sir
when
i
desire
you
to
fall
in
love
it
is
your
duty
to
obey
suppose
i
was
to
fall
in
love
with
a
person
you
did
not
like
would
you
allow
me
to
marry
her
most
certainly
not
sir
then
sir
is
it
reasonable
to
expect
me
to
marry
without
being
in
love
i
did
not
marry
for
love
sir
no
replied
i
forgetting
myself
a
little
and
a
pretty
mess
you
made
of
it
i
did
rejoined
my
father
in
a
rage
by
begetting
an
undutiful
graceless
insolent
ungrateful
son
my
dear
father
i
was
not
aware
that
i
had
a
brother
i
mean
you
sir
to
prove
to
you
how
unjust
you
are
sir
and
how
little
i
deserve
what
you
have
called
me
i
now
promise
you
to
marry
as
soon
as
you
wish
thank
you
my
boy
that
kind
of
you
but
i
will
say
that
you
are
a
comfort
and
a
treasure
to
me
and
i
bless
the
day
that
brought
you
to
my
arms
well
then
look
about
you
no
sir
i
leave
it
all
to
you
select
the
party
and
i
am
willing
to
obey
you
my
dear
boy
well
then
i
talk
the
matter
over
with
mr
masterton
and
the
general
shook
me
warmly
by
the
hand
the
next
day
i
picked
up
harcourt
and
proceeded
to
park
street
a
note
from
him
had
informed
them
of
our
intended
visit
and
other
visitors
had
been
denied
all
has
been
explained
cecilia
said
i
after
the
first
greeting
i
was
very
wrong
and
very
foolish
and
made
me
very
miserable
i
little
thought
that
you
japhet
would
have
made
me
cry
so
much
but
i
forgive
you
for
it
as
i
would
a
thousand
times
as
much
more
now
sit
down
and
tell
us
all
that
has
happened
since
you
left
us
not
yet
my
dear
cecilia
you
as
well
as
i
owe
a
reparation
to
poor
harcourt
whom
i
think
you
have
treated
cruelly
you
were
about
to
answer
a
question
of
vital
moment
when
i
broke
in
upon
you
and
you
have
since
kept
him
in
a
state
of
cruel
suspense
for
more
than
three
weeks
refusing
him
an
answer
until
he
brought
me
into
your
presence
an
hour
of
such
suspense
must
be
dreadful
and
before
we
sit
down
i
wish
everyone
should
feel
comfortable
and
happy
it
was
not
altogether
to
stimulate
mr
harcourt
to
bring
you
back
which
induced
me
to
refuse
to
answer
his
question
japhet
i
considered
that
your
return
had
rendered
it
necessary
that
it
should
be
deferred
until
i
saw
you
i
have
not
forgotten
japhet
and
never
forget
what
i
was
when
you
rescued
me
and
when
i
think
what
i
might
have
been
had
you
not
saved
me
i
shudder
at
the
bare
idea
i
have
not
forgotten
how
you
risked
and
nearly
lost
your
life
in
ireland
for
my
sake
neither
has
my
mother
we
are
beholden
to
you
for
all
our
present
happiness
and
i
am
eternally
indebted
to
you
for
rescuing
me
from
ignorance
poverty
and
perhaps
vice
you
have
been
more
much
more
than
a
father
to
me
more
much
more
than
a
brother
i
am
as
it
were
a
creature
of
your
own
fashioning
and
i
owe
to
you
that
which
i
never
can
repay
when
then
you
returned
so
unexpectedly
japhet
i
felt
that
you
had
a
paramount
right
in
my
disposal
and
i
was
glad
that
i
had
not
replied
to
mr
harcourt
as
i
wished
first
for
your
sanction
and
approval
i
know
all
that
has
passed
between
you
but
i
know
not
your
real
feelings
towards
mr
harcourt
he
acknowledges
that
he
treated
you
very
ill
and
it
was
his
sincere
repentance
of
having
so
done
and
his
praise
of
you
which
first
won
my
favour
and
now
japhet
if
you
have
still
animosity
against
mr
harcourt
if
you
stop
my
dear
fleta
i
will
answer
all
your
questions
at
once
i
took
harcourt
hand
and
placed
it
in
hers
may
god
bless
you
both
and
may
you
be
happy
cecilia
threw
her
arms
round
me
and
wept
so
did
everybody
else
i
believe
it
was
lucky
for
harcourt
that
i
was
in
love
with
susannah
temple
as
soon
as
cecilia
had
recovered
a
little
i
kissed
her
and
passed
her
over
to
her
right
owner
who
led
her
to
the
sofa
lady
de
clare
and
i
went
out
of
the
room
on
important
business
and
did
not
return
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
we
returned
cecilia
went
to
her
mother
and
embraced
her
while
harcourt
silently
squeezed
my
hand
we
then
all
sat
down
and
i
gave
them
an
account
of
all
that
had
passed
during
my
second
excursion
how
i
had
nearly
been
hanged
how
i
had
gone
mad
how
i
had
turned
quaker
and
apothecary
which
they
all
agreed
with
what
had
happened
to
me
before
made
up
a
very
eventful
history
and
japhet
if
it
be
a
fair
question
about
one
so
fair
was
that
miss
temple
who
was
at
church
with
you
yesterday
it
was
then
cecilia
if
ever
she
appears
in
the
same
circle
except
in
my
eyes
your
beauty
will
stand
in
some
danger
of
being
eclipsed
how
can
you
say
except
in
your
eyes
mr
harcourt
replied
cecilia
the
very
observation
proves
that
it
is
eclipsed
in
your
eyes
whatever
it
may
be
in
those
of
others
now
as
a
punishment
i
have
a
great
mind
to
order
you
away
again
until
you
bring
her
face
to
face
that
i
may
judge
myself
if
i
am
again
banished
replied
harcourt
i
shall
have
a
second
time
to
appeal
to
de
benyon
to
be
able
to
come
back
again
he
can
produce
her
i
have
no
doubt
and
perhaps
may
some
of
these
days
cecilia
oh
do
japhet
i
will
love
her
so
you
must
wait
a
little
first
i
am
not
quite
so
far
advanced
as
you
and
harcourt
i
have
not
received
the
consent
of
all
parties
as
you
have
but
i
must
now
leave
you
harcourt
i
presume
you
will
dine
here
i
must
dine
with
my
on
my
return
i
found
that
the
table
was
laid
for
three
and
that
the
general
had
asked
mr
masterton
from
which
i
augured
well
masterton
could
not
speak
to
me
when
he
arrived
but
he
gave
me
a
wink
and
a
smile
and
i
was
satisfied
japhet
said
my
father
you
have
no
engagement
i
hope
because
i
shall
call
at
mr
masterton
on
business
and
wish
you
to
accompany
me
i
replied
that
i
should
be
most
happy
and
the
conversation
became
general
i
accompanied
my
father
the
next
day
to
lincoln
inn
and
when
we
went
up
we
found
mr
masterton
at
the
table
with
mr
cophagus
and
susannah
sitting
apart
near
the
window
the
plot
thickens
thought
i
the
fact
was
as
i
was
afterwards
told
by
mr
masterton
he
had
prevailed
upon
cophagus
to
pretend
business
and
to
bring
susannah
with
him
and
appointed
them
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
our
time
this
he
had
arranged
that
the
general
might
see
miss
temple
as
if
by
accident
and
also
allow
me
who
my
father
supposed
was
not
aware
of
miss
temple
being
in
town
to
meet
with
her
what
a
deal
of
humbug
there
is
in
this
world
nothing
but
plot
and
counterplot
i
shook
hands
with
cophagus
who
i
perceived
had
notwithstanding
his
wife
veto
put
on
his
blue
cotton
net
pantaloons
and
hessian
boots
and
he
appeared
to
be
so
tight
in
both
that
he
could
hardly
move
as
far
as
i
could
judge
his
legs
had
not
improved
since
i
had
last
seen
them
in
this
his
favourite
dress
mr
de
benyon
i
believe
that
you
have
met
miss
temple
before
said
mr
masterton
winking
at
me
in
berkshire
was
it
not
miss
temple
allow
me
to
introduce
general
de
benyon
i
went
up
to
susannah
who
coloured
and
trembled
at
the
sight
of
my
father
as
i
expressed
my
hope
that
she
had
been
well
since
we
last
met
she
perceived
that
there
was
some
planned
scheme
and
was
so
puzzled
that
she
said
nothing
my
father
then
spoke
to
her
and
after
a
short
time
took
a
chair
and
seated
himself
close
to
her
i
never
knew
her
make
herself
so
agreeable
he
asked
her
where
she
was
staying
and
when
he
heard
that
it
was
with
mr
cophagus
he
said
that
he
should
have
the
pleasure
of
calling
upon
mr
cophagus
and
thank
him
for
his
kind
information
relative
to
me
shortly
afterwards
cophagus
took
his
leave
and
susannah
rose
to
accompany
him
when
my
father
hearing
that
they
had
walked
insisted
upon
putting
miss
temple
down
in
his
carriage
so
that
mr
cophagus
had
to
walk
home
one
way
and
i
the
other
part
three
chapter
twenty
five
poor
cophagus
finds
an
end
to
his
adventures
by
the
means
of
a
mad
bull
i
of
mine
by
matrimony
father
is
prettily
behaved
and
my
quaker
wife
the
most
fashionably
dressed
lady
in
town
verily
hum
alas
little
did
mr
cophagus
know
how
fatal
to
him
would
be
the
light
cotton
nets
when
he
put
them
on
that
day
he
had
proceeded
as
it
appears
about
two
thirds
of
his
way
home
he
lived
in
welbeck
street
when
he
perceived
a
rush
from
up
a
street
leading
into
he
looked
to
ascertain
the
cause
when
to
his
horror
he
perceived
what
to
him
was
the
greatest
of
all
horrors
a
mad
bull
if
anything
could
make
mr
cophagus
run
it
was
a
sight
like
that
and
he
did
run
but
he
could
not
run
fast
in
his
cotton
nets
and
tight
hessians
which
crippled
him
altogether
as
if
out
of
pure
spite
the
bull
singled
him
out
from
at
least
one
hundred
who
exerted
their
agility
and
again
was
poor
mr
cophagus
tossed
far
behind
the
animal
fortunately
breaking
his
fall
by
tumbling
on
a
large
dog
who
was
in
full
chase
the
dog
who
was
unable
to
crawl
from
beneath
the
unfortunate
cophagus
was
still
in
a
condition
to
bite
which
he
did
most
furiously
and
the
butcher
who
had
an
affection
for
his
dog
when
he
perceived
its
condition
also
vented
his
fury
upon
poor
cophagus
by
saluting
him
with
several
blows
on
his
head
with
his
cudgel
what
between
the
bull
the
dog
and
the
butcher
poor
mr
cophagus
was
taken
into
a
shop
in
a
very
deplorable
condition
after
some
time
he
recovered
and
was
able
to
name
his
residence
when
he
was
taken
home
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
i
received
a
note
from
susannah
informing
me
of
that
unfortunate
accident
my
father
had
just
finished
a
long
story
about
filial
duty
country
girls
good
wives
etcetera
and
had
wound
up
by
saying
that
he
and
mr
masterton
both
considered
that
miss
temple
would
be
a
very
eligible
match
and
that
as
i
had
requested
him
to
select
he
had
selected
her
accordingly
i
had
just
proved
how
truly
dutiful
i
was
by
promising
to
do
all
i
could
to
love
her
and
to
fulfil
his
wishes
when
the
note
was
put
in
my
hands
i
read
it
stated
its
contents
to
my
father
and
with
his
permission
immediately
jumped
into
a
and
drove
to
welbeck
street
on
my
arrival
i
found
poor
mrs
cophagus
in
a
state
of
syncope
and
susannah
attending
her
i
sent
for
the
surgeon
who
had
been
called
in
and
then
went
up
to
mr
cophagus
he
was
much
better
than
i
expected
calm
and
quite
sensible
his
wounds
had
been
dressed
by
the
surgeon
but
he
did
not
appear
to
be
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
injury
he
had
received
when
the
surgeon
came
i
questioned
him
he
informed
me
that
although
much
hurt
he
did
not
consider
that
there
was
any
danger
to
be
apprehended
there
were
no
bones
broken
the
only
fear
that
he
had
was
that
there
might
be
some
internal
injury
but
at
present
that
could
not
be
ascertained
i
thanked
him
and
consoled
mrs
cophagus
with
this
information
i
then
returned
to
her
husband
who
shook
his
head
and
muttered
as
i
put
my
ear
down
to
hear
him
thought
so
come
to
london
full
of
mad
bulls
tossed
die
and
so
on
o
no
replied
i
the
surgeon
says
that
there
is
no
danger
you
will
be
up
in
a
week
but
now
you
must
keep
very
quiet
i
will
send
mrs
cophagus
to
you
i
went
out
and
finding
her
composed
i
desired
her
to
go
to
her
husband
who
wished
to
see
her
and
i
was
left
alone
with
susannah
i
told
her
all
that
had
passed
and
after
two
delightful
hours
had
escaped
i
returned
home
to
the
hotel
my
father
had
waited
up
for
some
time
and
finding
that
i
did
not
return
had
retired
when
i
met
him
the
next
morning
i
mentioned
what
the
surgeon
had
said
but
stated
that
in
my
opinion
there
was
great
cause
for
alarm
in
a
man
of
mr
cophagus
advanced
age
my
father
agreed
with
me
but
could
not
help
pointing
out
what
a
good
opportunity
this
would
afford
for
my
paying
my
attentions
to
miss
temple
as
it
was
natural
that
i
should
be
interested
about
so
old
a
friend
as
mr
cophagus
my
filial
duty
inclined
me
to
reply
that
i
should
certainly
avail
myself
of
such
a
favourable
opportunity
my
adventures
are
now
drawing
to
a
close
i
must
pass
over
three
months
during
which
my
father
had
taken
and
furnished
a
house
in
grosvenor
square
and
i
whenever
i
could
spare
time
had
under
the
auspices
of
lord
windermear
again
been
introduced
into
the
world
as
mr
de
benyon
i
found
that
the
new
name
was
considered
highly
respectable
my
father
hall
tables
were
loaded
with
cards
and
i
even
received
two
dinner
invitations
from
lady
maelstrom
who
told
me
how
her
dear
nieces
had
wondered
what
had
become
of
me
and
that
they
were
afraid
that
louisa
would
have
fallen
into
a
decline
and
during
these
three
months
cecilia
and
susannah
had
been
introduced
and
had
become
as
inseparable
as
most
young
ladies
are
who
have
a
lover
apiece
and
no
cause
for
jealousy
mr
cophagus
had
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
go
down
into
the
country
vowing
much
to
the
chagrin
of
his
wife
that
he
never
would
put
his
foot
in
london
again
he
asked
me
whether
i
knew
any
place
where
there
were
mad
and
i
took
some
trouble
to
find
out
but
i
could
not
for
even
if
he
went
to
the
north
pole
although
there
were
no
bulls
yet
there
were
bull
bisons
and
musk
bulls
which
were
even
more
savage
upon
which
he
declared
that
this
was
not
a
world
to
live
in
and
to
prove
that
he
was
sincere
in
his
opinion
poor
fellow
about
three
months
after
his
retirement
into
the
country
he
died
from
a
general
decay
arising
from
the
shock
produced
on
his
system
but
before
these
three
months
had
passed
it
had
been
finally
arranged
that
harcourt
and
i
were
to
be
united
on
the
same
day
and
having
renewed
my
acquaintance
with
the
good
bishop
whom
i
had
taxed
with
being
my
father
he
united
us
both
to
our
respective
partners
my
father
made
over
to
me
the
sum
which
he
had
mentioned
mr
masterton
gave
susannah
ten
thousand
pounds
and
her
own
fortune
amounted
to
as
much
more
with
the
reversion
of
mr
cophagus
property
at
the
decease
of
his
widow
timothy
came
up
to
the
wedding
and
i
formally
put
him
in
the
possession
of
my
shop
and
stock
in
trade
and
he
has
now
a
flourishing
business
although
he
has
not
yet
found
his
mother
he
has
found
a
very
pretty
wife
which
he
says
does
quite
as
well
if
not
better
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
i
forgot
the
good
services
of
kathleen
who
was
soon
after
married
to
corny
a
small
farm
on
fleta
estate
was
appropriated
to
them
at
so
low
a
rent
that
in
a
few
years
they
were
able
to
purchase
the
property
and
corny
from
a
leveller
as
soon
as
he
was
comfortable
became
one
of
the
government
firmest
supporters
i
am
now
living
in
the
same
house
with
my
father
who
is
very
happy
and
behaves
pretty
well
he
is
seldom
in
a
passion
more
than
twice
a
week
which
we
consider
as
miraculous
now
that
i
am
writing
this
he
has
his
two
grandchildren
on
his
knees
mrs
cophagus
has
married
a
captain
in
the
life
guards
and
as
far
as
fashion
and
dress
are
concerned
may
be
said
to
be
going
the
whole
hog
and
now
as
i
have
no
doubt
that
my
readers
will
be
curious
to
know
whether
my
lovely
wife
adheres
to
her
primitive
style
of
dress
i
shall
only
repeat
a
conversation
of
yesterday
night
as
she
came
down
arrayed
for
a
splendid
ball
given
by
mrs
harcourt
de
clare
tell
me
now
de
benyon
said
she
is
not
this
a
pretty
dress
yes
my
dear
replied
i
looking
at
her
charming
face
and
figure
with
all
the
admiration
usual
in
the
honeymoon
it
is
indeed
but
do
you
not
think
my
dear
susan
said
i
putting
the
tip
of
my
white
glove
upon
her
snowy
shoulder
that
it
is
cut
down
a
too
low
too
low
de
benyon
why
it
not
half
so
low
as
mrs
harcourt
de
clare
or
lady
c
wear
their
dresses
well
my
dear
i
did
not
assert
that
it
was
i
only
asked
well
then
if
you
only
asked
for
information
de
benyon
i
will
tell
you
that
it
is
not
too
low
and
i
think
you
will
acknowledge
that
on
this
point
my
opinion
ought
to
be
decisive
for
if
i
have
no
other
merit
i
have
at
least
the
merit
of
being
the
woman
in
london
verily
thou
persuadest
me
susannah
replied
i
now
de
benyon
hold
your
tongue
like
a
husband
i
bowed
and
said
no
more
and
now
having
no
more
to
say
i
shall
also
make
my
bow
to
my
readers
and
bid
them
farewell
