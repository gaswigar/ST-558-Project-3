jake
and
yekl
the
operatives
of
the
in
which
jake
was
employed
had
been
idle
all
the
morning
it
was
after
twelve
and
the
boss
had
not
yet
returned
from
broadway
whither
he
had
betaken
himself
two
or
three
hours
before
in
quest
of
work
the
little
sweltering
assemblage
for
it
was
an
oppressive
day
in
midsummer
beguiled
their
suspense
variously
a
man
of
thirty
who
sat
with
the
back
of
his
chair
tilted
against
his
sewing
machine
was
intent
upon
an
english
newspaper
every
little
while
he
would
remove
it
from
his
eyes
showing
a
dyspeptic
face
fringed
with
a
thin
growth
of
dark
beard
to
consult
the
cumbrous
dictionary
on
his
knees
two
young
lads
one
seated
on
the
frame
of
the
next
machine
and
the
other
standing
were
boasting
to
one
another
of
their
respective
intimacies
with
the
leading
actors
of
the
jewish
stage
the
board
of
a
third
machine
in
a
corner
of
the
same
wall
supported
an
open
copy
of
a
socialist
magazine
in
yiddish
over
which
a
cadaverous
young
man
absorbedly
swayed
to
and
fro
droning
in
the
talmudical
intonation
a
operative
with
huge
red
side
whiskers
who
was
perched
on
the
presser
table
in
the
corner
opposite
was
mending
his
own
coat
while
the
presser
and
all
the
three
women
of
the
shop
occupying
the
three
machines
ranged
against
an
adjoining
wall
formed
an
attentive
audience
to
an
impromptu
lecture
upon
the
comparative
merits
of
boston
and
new
york
by
jake
he
had
been
speaking
for
some
time
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
overcrowded
stuffy
room
with
his
long
but
legs
wide
apart
his
bulky
round
head
aslant
and
one
of
his
bared
mighty
arms
akimbo
he
spoke
in
boston
yiddish
that
is
to
say
in
yiddish
more
copiously
spiced
with
mutilated
english
than
is
the
language
of
the
metropolitan
ghetto
in
which
our
story
lies
he
had
a
deep
and
rather
harsh
voice
and
his
r
could
do
credit
to
the
thickest
irish
brogue
when
i
was
in
boston
he
went
on
with
a
contemptuous
mien
intended
for
the
american
metropolis
i
knew
a
so
he
was
a
friend
of
john
shullivan
he
is
a
christian
that
feller
is
and
yet
the
two
of
us
lived
like
brothers
may
i
be
unable
to
move
from
this
spot
if
we
did
not
how
then
would
you
have
it
like
here
in
new
york
where
the
jews
are
a
of
and
can
not
speak
a
word
of
english
over
there
every
jew
speaks
english
like
a
stream
english
words
incorporated
in
the
yiddish
of
the
characters
of
this
narrative
are
given
in
italics
dzake
the
presser
broke
in
john
sullivan
is
no
longer
is
he
oh
no
not
always
is
it
holiday
jake
responded
with
what
he
considered
a
yankee
jerk
of
his
head
why
do
you
know
jimmie
corbett
him
and
jimmie
cholly
meetchel
too
can
betch
you
bootsh
johnnie
could
not
leak
chollie
he
is
a
big
chollie
is
he
pursued
his
florid
face
beaming
with
enthusiasm
for
his
subject
and
with
pride
in
the
diminutive
proper
nouns
he
flaunted
but
jimmie
him
did
he
knock
him
out
off
shight
he
came
near
making
a
meat
ball
of
him
with
a
chuckle
he
him
in
three
i
knew
a
feller
who
had
seen
the
fight
what
is
a
dzake
the
presser
inquired
jake
answer
to
the
question
carried
him
into
a
minute
exposition
of
sending
to
sleep
first
blood
and
other
commodities
of
the
fistic
business
he
must
have
treated
the
subject
rather
too
scientifically
however
for
his
female
listeners
obviously
paid
more
attention
to
what
he
did
in
the
course
of
the
boxing
match
which
he
had
now
and
then
by
way
of
illustration
with
the
thick
air
of
the
room
than
to
the
verbal
part
of
his
lecture
nay
even
the
performances
of
his
brawny
arms
and
magnificent
form
did
not
charm
them
as
much
as
he
thought
they
did
for
a
display
of
manly
force
when
connected
even
though
in
a
purely
imaginary
way
with
acts
of
violence
has
little
attraction
for
a
daughter
of
the
ghetto
much
more
interest
did
those
arms
and
form
command
on
their
own
merits
nor
was
his
chubby
face
neglected
true
there
was
a
suggestion
of
the
bulldog
in
its
make
up
but
this
effect
was
lost
upon
the
feminine
portion
of
jake
audience
for
his
features
illuminated
by
a
pair
of
eager
eyes
of
a
hazel
hue
and
shaded
by
a
thick
crop
of
dark
hair
were
after
all
rather
pleasing
than
otherwise
strongly
semitic
naturally
they
became
still
more
so
each
time
they
were
brightened
up
by
his
boyish
smile
indeed
jake
very
nose
which
was
fleshy
and
and
decidedly
not
jewish
although
not
decidedly
anything
else
seemed
to
join
the
mosaic
faith
and
even
his
shaven
upper
lip
looked
penitent
as
soon
as
that
smile
of
his
made
its
appearance
nice
fun
that
observed
the
man
who
had
stopped
sewing
to
follow
jake
exhibition
fighting
like
drunken
moujiks
in
russia
was
jake
merry
retort
and
for
an
exclamation
mark
he
puffed
up
his
cheeks
into
a
balloon
and
exploded
it
by
a
of
his
formidable
fist
look
i
beg
you
look
at
his
dog
tricks
the
other
said
in
disgust
horse
head
that
you
are
jake
rejoined
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
a
moujik
understands
how
to
a
disease
he
does
he
only
knows
how
to
strike
like
a
bear
jake
adapted
his
voice
and
gesticulation
to
the
idea
of
clumsiness
what
does
he
where
his
paw
will
land
so
he
strikes
here
one
must
observe
rules
at
this
point
meester
bernstein
for
so
the
man
was
usually
addressed
by
his
shopmates
looked
up
from
his
dictionary
ca
you
see
he
interposed
with
an
air
of
assumed
gravity
as
he
turned
to
jake
opponent
america
is
an
educated
country
so
they
wo
even
break
bones
without
grammar
they
tear
each
other
sides
according
to
and
left
you
know
this
was
a
thrust
at
jake
and
which
had
interfered
with
bernstein
reading
nevertheless
the
latter
proceeded
when
the
outburst
of
laughter
which
greeted
his
witticism
had
subsided
i
do
think
that
a
burly
russian
peasant
would
without
a
bit
of
grammar
crunch
the
bones
of
corbett
himself
and
he
would
not
him
a
cent
for
it
either
a
term
relating
to
the
hebrew
equivalent
of
the
letter
whose
pronunciation
depends
upon
the
right
or
left
position
of
a
mark
over
it
dot
sho
jake
retorted
somewhat
nonplussed
betch
he
would
not
the
peasant
would
lie
bleeding
like
a
hog
before
he
had
time
to
turn
around
they
might
kill
each
other
in
that
way
jake
asked
a
comely
blonde
whose
name
was
fanny
she
was
celebrated
for
her
lengthy
tirades
mostly
in
a
plaintive
nagging
strain
and
delivered
in
her
quiet
piping
voice
and
had
accordingly
been
dubbed
the
preacher
oh
that
will
happen
but
very
seldom
jake
returned
rather
glumly
the
theatrical
pair
broke
off
their
boasting
match
to
join
in
the
debate
which
soon
included
all
except
the
socialist
the
former
two
together
with
the
two
girls
and
the
presser
espousing
the
american
cause
while
malke
the
widow
and
de
viskes
sided
with
bernstein
let
it
be
as
you
say
said
the
leader
of
the
minority
withdrawing
from
the
contest
to
resume
his
newspaper
my
grandma
last
care
it
is
who
can
fight
best
nice
pleasure
remarked
the
widow
we
shall
see
how
it
will
lie
in
his
head
when
he
has
a
wife
and
children
to
jake
colored
what
does
a
know
about
these
things
he
said
irascibly
bernstein
again
could
not
help
intervening
and
you
jake
can
not
do
without
things
can
you
indeed
i
do
not
see
how
you
manage
to
live
without
them
do
you
like
it
i
do
jake
declared
tartly
once
i
live
in
america
he
pursued
on
the
defensive
i
want
to
know
that
i
live
in
america
a
kin
a
man
i
am
one
must
not
be
a
here
a
jew
is
as
good
as
a
gentile
how
then
would
you
have
it
the
way
it
is
in
russia
where
a
jew
is
afraid
to
stand
within
four
ells
of
a
christian
are
there
no
other
christians
than
in
america
bernstein
objected
with
an
amused
smile
why
do
you
look
for
the
educated
ones
do
you
mean
to
say
the
are
not
better
than
you
jake
said
with
a
yankee
wink
followed
by
his
semitic
smile
here
you
read
the
papers
and
yet
betch
you
do
know
that
corbett
i
never
read
about
fighters
bernstein
replied
with
a
bored
gesture
and
turned
to
his
paper
then
say
that
you
do
know
and
bernstein
made
no
reply
in
his
heart
jake
respected
him
and
was
now
anxious
to
vindicate
his
tastes
in
the
judgment
of
his
scholarly
shopmate
and
in
his
own
let
it
be
as
you
say
the
are
not
no
not
a
bit
he
said
ironically
continuing
to
address
himself
to
bernstein
but
what
will
you
say
to
all
and
play
it
he
concluded
triumphantly
bernstein
remained
silent
his
eyes
riveted
to
his
newspaper
ah
you
do
answer
said
jake
feeling
put
out
the
awkward
pause
which
followed
was
relieved
by
one
of
the
playgoers
who
wanted
to
know
whether
it
was
true
that
to
pitch
a
ball
required
more
skill
than
to
catch
one
you
must
know
how
to
jake
rejoined
with
the
cloud
lingering
on
his
brow
as
he
lukewarmly
delivered
an
imaginary
ball
and
i
for
my
part
do
see
what
wisdom
there
is
to
it
said
the
presser
with
a
shrug
i
think
i
could
throw
too
he
can
do
everything
laughingly
remarked
a
girl
named
pessé
how
hard
can
you
hit
jake
demanded
sarcastically
somewhat
warming
up
to
the
subject
as
hard
as
you
at
any
time
betch
you
a
dullar
to
you
ten
you
can
not
jake
answered
and
at
the
same
moment
he
fished
out
a
handful
of
coin
from
his
trousers
pocket
and
challengingly
presented
it
close
to
his
interlocutor
nose
there
he
goes
betting
the
presser
exclaimed
drawing
slightly
back
for
my
part
your
and
may
all
lie
in
the
earth
a
nice
entertainment
indeed
just
like
little
children
playing
ball
and
yet
people
say
america
is
a
country
i
do
see
it
you
do
you
are
a
bedraggled
afraid
to
budge
out
of
heshter
shtreet
as
jake
thus
vented
his
bad
humour
on
his
adversary
he
cast
a
glance
at
bernstein
as
if
anxious
to
attract
his
attention
and
to
him
in
the
discussion
look
at
the
yankee
the
presser
shot
back
more
of
a
one
than
you
he
thinks
that
one
mustache
makes
a
yankee
jake
turned
white
with
rage
my
i
ride
into
his
mug
and
give
such
a
and
planing
to
his
pig
snout
that
he
will
have
to
pick
up
his
teeth
that
all
you
are
good
for
better
do
answer
him
jake
said
fanny
intimately
oh
i
came
near
forgetting
that
he
has
somebody
to
take
his
part
snapped
the
presser
the
girl
milky
face
became
a
fiery
red
and
she
retorted
in
vituperative
yiddish
from
that
vocabulary
which
is
the
undivided
possession
of
her
sex
the
presser
jerked
out
an
innuendo
still
more
than
his
first
jake
with
bloodshot
eyes
leaped
at
the
offender
and
catching
him
by
the
front
of
his
waistcoat
was
aiming
one
of
those
bearlike
blows
which
but
a
short
while
ago
he
had
decried
in
the
moujik
when
bernstein
sprang
to
his
side
and
tore
him
away
pessé
placing
herself
between
the
two
enemies
do
get
excited
bernstein
coaxed
him
better
do
soil
your
hands
fanny
added
after
a
slight
pause
bernstein
could
not
forbear
a
remark
which
he
had
stubbornly
repressed
while
jake
was
challenging
him
to
a
debate
on
the
education
of
baseball
players
look
here
jake
since
fighters
and
baseball
men
are
all
educated
then
why
do
you
try
to
become
so
instead
of
your
money
on
fights
dancing
and
things
like
that
would
it
not
be
better
if
you
paid
it
to
a
teacher
jake
flew
into
a
fresh
passion
what
i
do
with
my
money
he
said
i
do
steal
it
from
you
do
i
rejoice
that
you
keep
tormenting
your
books
much
does
he
know
learning
learning
and
learning
and
still
he
can
not
speak
english
i
do
learn
and
yet
i
speak
quicker
than
you
a
deep
blush
of
wounded
vanity
mounted
to
bernstein
sallow
cheek
right
ull
right
he
cut
the
conversation
short
and
took
up
the
newspaper
another
nervous
silence
fell
upon
the
group
jake
felt
wretched
he
uttered
an
english
oath
which
in
his
heart
he
directed
against
himself
as
much
as
against
his
sedate
companion
and
fell
to
frowning
upon
the
leg
of
a
machine
vill
you
go
by
joe
asked
fanny
in
english
speaking
in
an
undertone
joe
was
a
dancing
master
she
was
sure
jake
intended
to
call
at
his
academy
that
evening
and
she
put
the
question
only
in
order
to
help
him
out
of
his
sour
mood
no
said
jake
morosely
vy
is
vensday
and
without
you
i
do
know
it
he
snarled
in
yiddish
the
finisher
girl
blushed
deeply
and
refrained
from
any
response
he
does
look
like
a
yankee
does
he
pessé
whispered
to
her
after
a
little
go
and
ask
him
go
and
hang
yourself
together
with
him
such
a
nasty
preacher
did
you
ever
hear
one
dares
not
say
a
word
to
the
noblewoman
at
this
juncture
the
boss
a
dwarfish
little
jew
with
a
vivid
pair
of
eyes
and
a
shaggy
black
beard
darted
into
the
chamber
it
is
he
said
with
a
gesture
of
despair
there
is
not
a
stitch
of
work
if
only
for
a
cure
look
look
how
they
have
lowered
their
noses
he
then
added
with
a
triumphant
grin
i
shall
not
be
teasing
you
living
things
the
expressman
is
i
would
not
go
till
i
saw
him
and
then
i
caught
a
car
no
other
could
get
a
single
jacket
even
if
he
fell
upon
his
knees
do
you
appreciate
it
at
least
not
much
ay
the
presser
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
presently
came
back
laden
with
bundles
of
cut
cloth
which
he
threw
down
on
the
table
a
wild
scramble
ensued
the
presser
looked
on
indifferently
the
three
finisher
women
who
had
awaited
the
advent
of
the
bundles
as
eagerly
as
the
men
now
calmly
put
on
their
hats
they
knew
that
their
part
of
the
work
would
come
before
three
and
so
overjoyed
by
the
certainty
of
employment
for
at
least
another
day
or
two
they
departed
till
that
hour
look
at
the
rush
they
are
making
just
like
the
locusts
of
egypt
the
boss
cried
half
sternly
and
half
with
humour
as
he
shielded
the
treasure
with
both
his
arms
from
all
except
de
viskes
and
jake
the
two
being
what
is
called
in
parlance
favorites
do
be
snatching
and
catching
like
that
the
boss
went
on
you
may
burn
your
fingers
go
to
your
machines
i
say
the
soup
will
be
served
in
separate
plates
never
fear
it
wo
get
cold
the
hands
at
last
desisted
gingerly
jake
and
the
whiskered
operator
carrying
off
two
of
the
largest
bundles
the
others
went
to
their
machines
and
remained
seated
their
hungry
glances
riveted
to
the
booty
until
they
too
were
provided
the
little
boss
distributed
the
bundles
with
dignified
deliberation
in
point
of
fact
he
was
no
less
impatient
to
have
the
work
started
than
any
of
his
employees
but
in
him
the
feeling
was
overridden
by
a
kind
of
malicious
pleasure
which
he
took
in
their
eagerness
and
in
the
demonstration
of
his
power
over
the
men
some
of
whom
he
knew
to
have
enjoyed
a
more
comfortable
past
than
himself
the
machines
of
jake
and
de
viskes
led
off
in
a
duet
which
presently
became
a
trio
and
in
another
few
minutes
the
floor
was
fairly
dancing
to
the
discords
of
the
whole
frantic
sextet
in
the
excitement
of
the
scene
called
forth
by
the
appearance
of
the
bundles
jake
gloomy
mood
had
melted
away
nevertheless
while
his
machine
was
delivering
its
first
shrill
staccatos
his
heart
recited
a
vow
as
soon
as
i
get
my
pay
i
shall
call
on
the
installment
man
and
give
him
a
deposit
for
a
ticket
the
prospective
ticket
was
to
be
for
a
passage
across
the
atlantic
from
hamburg
to
new
york
and
as
the
notion
of
it
passed
through
jake
mind
it
evoked
there
the
image
of
a
young
woman
with
a
babe
in
her
lap
however
as
the
sewing
machine
throbbed
and
writhed
under
jake
lusty
kicks
it
seemed
to
be
swiftly
carrying
him
away
from
the
apparition
which
had
the
effect
of
receding
as
a
wayside
object
does
from
the
passenger
of
a
flying
train
until
it
lost
itself
in
a
misty
distance
other
visions
emerging
in
its
place
it
was
some
three
years
before
the
opening
of
this
story
that
jake
had
last
beheld
that
very
image
in
the
flesh
but
then
at
that
period
of
his
life
he
had
not
even
suspected
the
existence
of
a
name
like
jake
being
known
to
himself
and
to
all
povodye
a
town
in
northwestern
russia
as
yekl
or
yekelé
it
was
not
as
a
deserter
from
military
service
that
he
had
shaken
off
the
dust
of
that
town
where
he
had
passed
the
first
years
of
his
life
as
the
only
son
of
aged
parents
he
had
been
exempt
from
the
duty
of
bearing
arms
jake
may
have
forgotten
it
but
his
mother
still
frequently
recurs
to
the
day
when
he
came
rushing
home
panting
for
breath
with
the
red
certificate
assuring
his
immunity
in
his
hand
she
nearly
fainted
for
happiness
and
when
stroking
his
dishevelled
sidelocks
with
her
bony
hand
and
feasting
her
eye
on
his
chubby
face
she
whispered
my
recovered
child
god
be
blessed
for
his
mercy
there
was
a
joyous
tear
in
his
eye
as
well
as
in
hers
well
does
she
remember
how
she
gently
spat
on
his
forehead
three
times
to
avert
the
effect
of
a
possible
evil
eye
on
her
flourishing
tree
of
a
boy
and
how
his
father
standing
by
made
merry
over
what
he
called
her
crazy
womanish
tricks
and
said
she
had
better
fetch
some
brandy
in
honour
of
the
glad
event
but
if
yekl
was
averse
to
wearing
a
soldier
uniform
on
his
own
person
he
was
none
the
less
fond
of
seeing
it
on
others
his
ruling
passion
even
after
he
had
become
a
husband
and
a
father
was
to
watch
the
soldiers
drilling
on
the
square
in
front
of
the
whitewashed
barracks
near
which
stood
his
father
smithy
from
a
cheder
boy
he
showed
a
knack
at
placing
himself
on
terms
of
familiarity
with
the
jewish
members
of
the
local
regiment
whose
uniforms
struck
terror
into
the
hearts
of
his
schoolmates
he
would
often
play
truant
to
attend
a
military
parade
no
lad
in
town
knew
so
many
russian
words
or
was
as
well
versed
in
army
terminology
as
yekelé
beril
the
blacksmith
and
after
he
had
left
cheder
while
working
his
father
bellows
yekl
would
vary
synagogue
airs
with
martial
song
a
school
where
jewish
children
are
instructed
in
the
old
testament
or
the
talmud
three
years
had
passed
since
yekl
had
for
the
last
time
set
his
eyes
on
the
whitewashed
barracks
and
on
his
father
rickety
smithy
which
for
reasons
indirectly
connected
with
the
government
redoubled
discrimination
against
the
sons
of
israel
had
become
inadequate
to
support
two
families
three
years
since
that
beautiful
summer
morning
when
he
had
mounted
the
spacious
which
was
to
carry
him
to
the
train
since
hurried
by
the
driver
he
had
leaned
out
of
the
wagon
to
kiss
his
old
son
amid
the
lamentations
of
his
wife
the
tremulous
go
in
good
health
of
his
father
and
the
startled
screams
of
the
neighbours
who
rushed
to
the
relief
of
his
fainting
mother
the
broken
russian
learned
among
the
povodye
soldiers
he
had
exchanged
for
english
of
a
corresponding
quality
and
the
bellows
for
a
sewing
machine
a
change
of
weapons
in
the
battle
of
life
which
had
been
brought
about
both
by
yekl
tender
religious
feelings
and
robust
legs
he
had
been
shocked
by
the
very
notion
of
seeking
employment
at
his
old
trade
in
a
city
where
it
is
in
the
hands
of
christians
and
consequently
involves
a
violation
of
the
mosaic
sabbath
on
the
other
hand
his
legs
had
been
thought
by
his
early
american
advisers
eminently
fitted
for
the
treadle
unlike
new
york
the
jewish
of
boston
keep
in
line
as
a
rule
with
the
christian
factories
in
observing
sunday
as
the
only
day
of
rest
there
is
however
even
in
boston
a
lingering
minority
of
bosses
more
particularly
in
the
pants
branch
who
abide
by
the
sabbath
of
their
fathers
accordingly
it
was
under
one
of
these
that
yekl
had
first
been
initiated
into
the
world
subsequently
jake
following
numerous
examples
had
given
up
pants
for
the
more
remunerative
cloaks
and
having
rapidly
attained
skill
in
his
new
trade
he
had
moved
to
new
york
the
centre
of
the
industry
soon
after
his
arrival
in
boston
his
religious
scruples
had
followed
in
the
wake
of
his
former
first
name
and
if
he
was
still
free
from
work
on
saturdays
he
found
many
another
way
of
desecrating
the
sabbath
three
years
had
intervened
since
he
had
first
set
foot
on
american
soil
and
the
thought
of
ever
having
been
a
yekl
would
bring
to
lips
a
smile
of
patronizing
commiseration
for
his
former
self
as
to
his
russian
family
name
which
was
podkovnik
jake
friends
had
such
rare
use
for
it
that
by
mere
negligence
it
had
been
left
intact
chapter
ii
the
new
york
ghetto
it
was
after
seven
in
the
evening
when
jake
finished
his
last
jacket
some
of
the
operators
had
laid
down
their
work
before
while
others
cast
an
envious
glance
on
him
as
he
was
dressing
to
leave
and
fell
to
their
machines
with
reluctantly
redoubled
energy
fanny
was
a
week
worker
and
her
time
had
been
up
at
seven
but
on
this
occasion
her
toilet
had
taken
an
uncommonly
long
time
and
she
was
not
ready
until
jake
got
up
from
his
chair
then
she
left
the
room
rather
suddenly
and
with
a
demonstrative
all
when
jake
reached
the
street
he
found
her
on
the
sidewalk
making
a
pretense
of
brushing
one
of
her
sleeves
with
the
cuff
of
the
other
so
kvick
she
asked
raising
her
head
in
feigned
surprise
you
cull
dot
kvick
he
returned
grimly
say
ai
you
goin
to
dance
really
she
queried
shamefacedly
i
tol
you
i
vould
what
does
want
of
me
he
complained
to
himself
proceeding
on
his
way
he
grew
conscious
of
his
low
spirits
and
tracing
them
with
some
effort
to
their
source
he
became
gloomier
still
no
more
fun
for
me
he
decided
i
shall
get
them
over
here
and
begin
a
new
life
after
supper
which
he
had
taken
as
usual
at
his
lodgings
he
went
out
for
a
walk
he
was
firmly
determined
to
keep
himself
from
visiting
joe
peltner
dancing
academy
and
accordingly
he
took
a
direction
opposite
to
suffolk
street
where
that
establishment
was
situated
having
passed
a
few
blocks
however
his
feet
contrary
to
his
will
turned
into
a
side
street
and
thence
into
one
leading
to
suffolk
i
shall
only
drop
in
to
tell
joe
that
i
can
not
sell
any
of
his
ball
tickets
and
return
them
he
attempted
to
deceive
his
own
conscience
hailing
this
pretext
with
delight
he
quickened
his
pace
as
much
as
the
overcrowded
sidewalks
would
allow
he
had
to
pick
and
nudge
his
way
through
dense
swarms
of
bedraggled
humanity
past
garbage
barrels
rearing
their
overflowing
contents
in
sickening
piles
and
lining
the
streets
in
malicious
suggestion
of
rows
of
trees
underneath
tiers
and
tiers
of
fire
escapes
barricaded
and
festooned
with
mattresses
pillows
and
not
yet
gathered
in
for
the
night
the
sultry
atmosphere
was
laden
with
nausea
and
pierced
with
a
discordant
and
as
it
were
plaintive
buzz
supper
had
been
despatched
in
a
hurry
and
the
teeming
populations
of
the
cyclopic
tenement
houses
were
out
in
full
force
for
fresh
air
as
even
these
people
will
say
in
mental
quotation
marks
suffolk
street
is
in
the
very
thick
of
the
battle
for
breath
for
it
lies
in
the
heart
of
that
part
of
the
east
side
which
has
within
the
last
two
or
three
decades
become
the
ghetto
of
the
american
metropolis
and
indeed
the
metropolis
of
the
ghettos
of
the
world
it
is
one
of
the
most
densely
populated
spots
on
the
face
of
the
earth
a
seething
human
sea
fed
by
streams
streamlets
and
rills
of
immigration
flowing
from
all
the

amid

moral

lifted
from

purified
and
imbued
with
educated
men
and

with
their
intellectual
polish
tarnished
in
the
inclement
weather
of
adversity
ignorant
sons
of
toil
grown
enlightened
in
fine
people
with
all
sorts
of
antecedents
tastes
habits
inclinations
and
speaking
all
sorts
of
subdialects
of
the
same
jargon
thrown
pellmell
into
one
social
caldron
a
human
hodgepodge
with
its
component
parts
changed
but
not
yet
fused
into
one
homogeneous
whole
and
so
the
stoops
sidewalks
and
pavements
of
suffolk
street
were
thronged
with
panting
chattering
or
frisking
multitudes
in
one
spot
the
scene
received
a
kind
of
weird
picturesqueness
from
children
dancing
on
the
pavement
to
the
strident
music
hurled
out
into
the
tumultuous
din
from
a
row
of
the
open
and
brightly
illuminated
windows
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
new
tenement
house
some
of
the
young
women
on
the
sidewalk
opposite
raised
a
longing
eye
to
these
windows
for
floating
by
through
the
dazzling
light
within
were
young
women
like
themselves
with
masculine
arms
round
their
waists
as
the
spectacle
caught
jake
eye
his
heart
gave
a
leap
he
violently
pushed
his
way
through
the
waltzing
swarm
and
dived
into
the
corridor
of
the
house
whence
the
music
issued
presently
he
found
himself
on
the
threshold
and
in
the
overpowering
air
of
a
spacious
oblong
chamber
alive
with
a
dishevelled
reeking
crowd
an
uproarious
human
vortex
whirling
to
the
squeaky
notes
of
a
violin
and
the
thumping
of
a
piano
the
room
was
judging
by
its
untidy
walls
and
the
uncouth
wooden
pillars
supporting
its
bare
ceiling
more
accustomed
to
the
whir
of
sewing
machines
than
to
the
noises
which
filled
it
at
the
present
moment
it
took
up
the
whole
of
the
first
floor
of
a
house
built
for
large
and
until
recently
it
had
served
its
original
purpose
as
faithfully
as
the
four
upper
floors
which
were
still
the
daily
scenes
of
feverish
industry
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
there
was
now
a
marble
soda
fountain
in
charge
of
an
unkempt
boy
a
stocky
young
man
with
a
black
entanglement
of
coarse
curly
hair
was
bustling
about
among
the
dancers
now
and
then
he
would
pause
with
his
eyes
bent
upon
some
two
pairs
of
feet
and
fall
to
clapping
time
and
drawling
out
in
a
preoccupied
singsong
von

this
was
professor
peltner
himself
whose
curly
hair
by
the
way
had
more
to
do
with
the
success
of
his
institution
than
his
stumpy
legs
which
according
to
the
unanimous
dictum
of
his
male
pupils
moved
about
like
a
pair
of
bears
the
throng
showed
but
a
very
scant
sprinkling
of
plump
cheeks
and
shapely
figures
in
a
multitude
of
haggard
faces
and
flaccid
forms
nearly
all
were
in
their
clothes
very
few
of
the
men
sporting
a
wilted
white
shirt
front
and
while
the
general
effect
of
the
kaleidoscope
was
one
of
boisterous
hilarity
many
of
the
individual
couples
somehow
had
the
air
of
being
engaged
in
hard
toil
rather
than
as
if
they
were
dancing
for
amusement
the
faces
of
some
of
these
bore
a
wondering
martyrlike
expression
as
who
should
say
what
have
we
done
to
be
knocked
about
in
this
manner
for
the
rest
there
were
all
sorts
of
attitudes
and
miens
in
the
whirling
crowd
one
young
fellow
for
example
seemed
to
be
threatening
vengeance
to
the
ceiling
while
his
partner
was
all
but
exultantly
exclaiming
lord
of
the
universe
what
a
world
this
be
another
maiden
looked
as
if
she
kept
murmuring
you
do
say
whereas
her
cavalier
mutely
ejaculated
glad
to
try
my
best
your
noble
birth
after
the
fashion
of
a
russian
soldier
the
prevailing
stature
of
the
assemblage
was
rather
below
medium
this
does
not
include
the
dozen
or
two
of
undergrown
lasses
of
fourteen
or
thirteen
who
had
come
surreptitiously
and
to
allay
the
suspicion
of
their
mothers
in
their
white
aprons
they
accordingly
had
only
these
articles
to
check
at
the
hat
box
and
hence
the
nickname
of
ladies
by
which
this
truant
contingent
was
known
at
joe
academy
so
that
as
jake
now
stood
in
the
doorway
with
an
orphaned
collar
button
glistening
out
of
the
band
of
his
collarless
shirt
front
and
an
affected
expression
of
overshadowing
his
face
his
strapping
figure
towered
over
the
circling
throng
before
him
he
was
immediately
noticed
and
became
the
target
for
hellos
smiles
winks
and
all
manner
of
pleasantry
vot
you
stand
like
dot
you
vont
to

or
you
a

or
you
vont
a

or
again
is
it
hot
anawff
for
you
to
all
of
which
jake
returned
an
invariable
yep
each
time
resuming
his
bored
mien
as
he
thus
gazed
at
the
dancers
a
feeling
of
envy
came
over
him
look
at
them
he
said
to
himself
begrudgingly
how
merry
they
are
such
they
can
hardly
set
a
foot
well
and
yet
they
are
free
while
i
am
a
married
man
but
wait
till
you
get
married
too
he
prospectively
avenged
himself
on
joe
pupils
we
shall
see
how
you
will
then
dance
and
jump
presently
a
wave
of
joe
hand
brought
the
music
and
the
trampling
to
a
pause
the
girls
at
once
took
their
seats
on
the
ladies
bench

the

of

retired

reserved
for

only
several

nonchalantly
overstepped

and
nothing

by
the

the

bevy
of
both

he
refused
to
unbend
and
to
enter
into
their
facetious
mood
and
his
morose
air
became
the
topic
of
their
persiflage

by
the

then
blew
on
his
whistle
a
prolonged
shrill
warble
and
once

he
added
indulging
in
a
momentary
lapse
into
yiddish
english
was
the
official
language
of
the
academy
where
it
was
broken
and
mispronounced
in
as
many
different
ways
as
there
were
yiddish
dialects
represented
in
that
institution
de
vay
look
with
which
jake
seized
from
charley
a
lanky
miss
jacobs
and
proceeded
to
set
an
example
of
correct
waltzing
much
to
the
unconcealed
delight
of
the
girl
who
let
her
head
rest
on
his
breast
with
an
air
of
reverential
gratitude
and
bliss
and
to
the
embarrassment
of
her
cavalier
who
looked
at
the
evolutions
of
jake
feet
without
seeing
presently
jake
was
beckoned
away
to
a
corner
by
joe
whereupon
miss
jacobs
looking
daggers
at
the
little
professor
sulked
off

distant

and
once
more
protesting
his
firm
conviction
that
mamie
would
disregard
his
request
he
started
to
prove
that
she
would
not
he
had
to
traverse
nearly
the
entire
length
of
the
hall
and
notwithstanding
that
he
was
compelled
to
steer
clear
of
the
dancers
he
contrived
to
effect
the
passage
at
the
swellest
of
his
gaits
which
means
that
he
jauntily
bobbed
and
lurched
after
the
manner
of
a
blacksmith
tugging
at
the
bellows
and
held
up
his
enormous
bullet
head
as
if
he
were
bidding
defiance
to
the
whole
world
finally
he
paused
in
front
of
a
girl
with
a
superabundance
of
side
bangs
and
with
a
pert
ill
natured
pretty
face
of
the
most
strikingly
semitic
cast
in
the
whole
gathering
she
looked
or
more
was
inclined
to
plumpness
and
her
shrewd
deep
dark
eyes
gleamed
out
of
a
warm
gipsy
complexion
jake
found
her
seated
in
a
fatigued
attitude
on
a
chair
near
the
piano

he
said
bowing
with
mock
gallantry

too
fresh
she
said
with
a
contemptuous
grimace
like
the
majority
of
the
girls
of
the
academy
mamie
english
was
a
much
nearer
approach
to
a
justification
of
its
name
than
the
gibberish
spoken
by
the
men
jake
felt
routed
but
he
put
a
bold
face
on
it
and
broke
out
with
studied
resentment

with
a
playful
pout
the
compliment
was
acknowledged
by
one
of
jake

his
triumph

am
the
next
two
waltzes
mamie
danced
with
the
ungainly
novice
taking
exaggerated
pains
with
him
then
came
a
lancers
joe
calling
out
the
successive
movements
huckster
fashion
his
command
was
followed
by
less
than
half
of
the
class
however
for
the
greater
part
preferred
to
avail
themselves
of
the
same
music
for
waltzing
jake
was
bent
upon
giving
mamie
what
he
called
a
sholid
good
time
and
as
she
shared
his
view
that
a
square
or
fancy
dance
was
as
flimsy
an
affair
as
a
stick
of
candy
they
joined
or
rather
led
the
seceding
majority
they
spun
along
with
gusto
every
little
while
he
lifted
her
on
his
powerful
arm
and
gave
her
a
mill
he
yelping
and
she
squeaking
for
sheer
ecstasy
as
he
did
so
and
throughout
the
performance
his
face
and
his
whole
figure
seemed
to
be
exclaiming
a
kin
a
man
am
several
waifs
stood
in
a
cluster
admiring
or
begrudging
the
antics
of
the
star
couple
among
these
was
lanky
miss
jacobs
and
fanny
the
preacher
who
had
shortly
before
made
her
appearance
in
the
hall
and
now
stood
pale
and
forlorn
by
the
girl
side
look
at
the
way
she
is
stickin
to
him
the
little
girl
observed
with
envious
venom
her
gaze
riveted
to
mamie
whose
shapely
head
was
at
this
moment
reclining
on
jake
shoulders
with
her
eyes
half
shut
as
if
melting
in
a
transport
of
bliss
fanny
felt
cut
to
the
quick
you
are
jealous
ai
you
she
jerked
out
who
me
vy
should
i
be
jealous
miss
jacobs
protested
colouring
on
my
part
let
them
both
go
to
must
be
jealous
here
here
see
how
your
eyes
are
creeping
out
looking
here

she
teased
her
offender
in
yiddish
poking
her
little
finger
at
her
as
she
spoke
will
you
shut
your
scurvy
mouth
little
piece
of
ugliness
you
such
a
piggish
apron
check
poor
fanny
burst
out
under
breath
tears
starting
to
her
eyes
such
a
nasty
little
runt
another
girl
chimed
in
such
a
little
cricket
already
knows
what
is
a
third
of
the
bystanders
put
in
you
had
better
go
home
or
your
mamma
will
give
you
a
spanking
whereat
the
little
cricket
made
a
retort
which
had
better
be
left
unrecorded
to
think
of
a
bit
of
a
flea
like
that
having
so
much
here
is
america
for
you
america
for
a
country
and
that
do
for
a
language
observed
one
of
the
young
men
of
the
group
indulging
one
of
the
stereotype
jokes
of
the
ghetto
the
passage
at
arms
drew
jake
attention
to
the
little
knot
of
spectators
and
his
eye
fell
on
fanny
whereupon
he
summarily
relinquished
his
partner
on
the
floor
and
advanced
toward
his
shopmate
who
seeing
him
approach
hastened
to
retreat
to
the
bench
where
she
remained
seated
with
a
drooping
head
hello
fanny
he
shouted
briskly
coming
up
in
front
of
her
hello
she
returned
rigidly
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
dirty
floor
come
give
ush
a
tvisht
vill
you
but
you
ai
goin
by
joe
she
answered
with
a
withering
curl
of
her
lip
her
glance
still
on
the
ground
go
to
your
lady
she
be
mad

fanny
i
come
to
tell
jaw
shometin
an
ull
he
said
guiltily
why
should
you
apologize
she
addressed
the
tip
of
her
shoe
in
her
mother
tongue
as
if
he
was
obliged
to
apologize
to
me
my
you
can
with
her

and
night
do
i
care
as
if
i
i
have
only
come
to
see
what
a
you
are
do
you
think
i
am
a
as
as
your
mamie
as
if
i
had
not
known
he
wanted
to
make
me
stay
at
home
what
are

afraid
of

then
as
if
i
was
in
his
way
what
business
have
i
to
be
in
your
way
who
is
in
your
way
while
she
was
thus
speaking
in
her
voluble
querulous
harassing
manner
jake
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
in
an
attitude
of
mock
attention
then
suddenly
losing
patience
he
said
alla
right
you
will
finish
your
sermon
afterward
and
in
the
meantime
have
a
from
the
land
of
with
which
he
forcibly
dragged
her
off
her
seat
catching
her
round
the
waist
but
i
do
need
it
i
do
wish
it
go
to
your
mamie
she
protested
struggling
i
tell
you
i
do
need
it
i
do
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
choked
off
by
her
violent
breathing
for
by
this
time
she
was
spinning
with
jake
like
a
top
after
another
pretense
at
struggling
to
free
herself
she
succumbed
and
presently
clung
to
her
partner
the
picture
of
triumph
and
beatitude
meanwhile
mamie
had
walked
up
to
joe
side
and
without
much
difficulty
caused
him
to
abandon
the
lancers
party
to
themselves
and
to
resume
with
her
the
waltz
which
jake
had
so
abruptly
broken
off
in
the
course
of
the
following
intermission
she
diplomatically
seated
herself
beside
her
rival
and
paraded
her
tranquillity
of
mind
by
accosting
her
with
a
question
on
shop
matters
fanny
was
not
blind
to
the
manoeuvre
but
her
exultation
was
all
the
greater
for
it
and
she
participated
in
the
ensuing
conversation
with
exuberant
geniality
they
were
joined
by
jake
vell
vill
you
treat
jake
said
mamie
vot
you
vant
a
kish
he
replied
putting
his
offer
in
action
as
well
as
in
language
mamie
slapped
his
arm
may
the
angel
of
death
kiss
you
said
her
lips
in
yiddish
try
again
her
glowing
face
overruled
them
in
a
dialect
of
its
own
fanny
laughed
once
i
am
both
must
be
alike
remarked
the
gallant
and
again
he
proved
himself
as
good
as
his
word
although
fanny
struggled
with
greater
energy
and
ostensibly
with
more
real
indignation
but
vy
do
you
treat
you
stingy
loafer
you
vot
elsh
you
vant
a
peench
he
was
again
on
the
point
of
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
but
mamie
contrived
to
repay
the
pinch
before
she
had
received
it
and
added
a
generous
piece
of
profanity
into
the
bargain
whereupon
there
ensued
a
scuffle
of
a
character
which
defies
description
in
more
senses
than
one
nevertheless
jake
marched
his
two
ladas
up
to
the
marble
fountain
and
regaled
them
with
two
cents
worth
of
soda
each
an
hour
or
so
later
when
jake
got
out
into
the
street
his
breast
pocket
was
loaded
with
a
fresh
batch
of
professor
peltner
grand
annual
ball
tickets
and
his
two
arms
with
mamie
and
fanny
respectively
as
soon
as
i
get
my
wages
i
call
on
the
installment
agent
and
give
him
a
deposit
for
a
steamship
ticket
presently
glimmered
through
his
mind
as
he
adjusted
his
hold
upon
the
two
girls
snugly
gathering
them
to
his
sides
chapter
iii
in
the
grip
of
his
past
jake
had
never
even
vaguely
abandoned
the
idea
of
supplying
his
wife
and
child
with
the
means
of
coming
to
join
him
he
was
more
or
less
prompt
in
remitting
her
monthly
allowance
of
ten
rubles
and
the
visit
to
the
draft
and
passage
office
had
become
part
of
the
routine
of
his
life
it
had
the
invariable
effect
of
arousing
his
dormant
scruples
and
he
hardly
ever
left
the
office
without
ascertaining
the
price
of
a
steerage
voyage
from
hamburg
to
new
york
but
no
sooner
did
he
emerge
from
the
dingy
basement
into
the
noisy
scenes
of
essex
street
than
he
would
consciously
let
his
mind
wander
off
to
other
topics
formerly
during
the
early
part
of
his
sojourn
in
boston
his
landing
place
where
some
of
his
townsfolk
resided
and
where
he
had
passed
his
first
two
years
in
america
he
used
to
mention
his
gitl
and
his
yosselé
so
frequently
and
so
enthusiastically
that
some
wags
among
the
hanover
street
tailors
would
sing
yekl
and
wife
and
the
baby
to
the
tune
of
molly
and
i
and
the
baby
in
the
natural
course
of
things
however
these
retrospective
effusions
gradually
became
far
between
and
since
he
had
shifted
his
abode
to
new
york
he
carefully
avoided
all
reference
to
his
antecedents
the
jewish
quarter
of
the
metropolis
which
is
a
vast
and
compact
city
within
a
city
offers
its
denizens
incomparably
fewer
chances
of
contact
with
the
portion
of
the
population
than
any
of
the
three
separate
ghettos
of
boston
as
a
consequence
since
jake
advent
to
new
york
his
passion
for
american
sport
had
considerably
cooled
off
and
to
make
up
for
this
his
enthusiastic
nature
before
long
found
vent
in
dancing
and
in
a
general
life
of
gallantry
his
proved
knack
with
the
gentle
sex
had
turned
his
head
and
now
cost
him
all
his
leisure
time
still
he
would
occasionally
attend
some
variety
show
in
which
boxing
was
the
main
drawing
card
and
somehow
managed
to
keep
track
of
the
salient
events
of
the
sporting
world
generally
judging
from
his
unstaid
habits
and
abandon
to
the
pleasures
of
life
his
present
associates
took
it
for
granted
that
he
was
single
and
instead
of
twitting
him
with
the
feigned
assumption
that
he
had
deserted
a
family
a
piece
of
burlesque
as
old
as
the
ghetto
they
would
quiz
him
as
to
which
of
his
girls
he
was
dead
struck
on
and
as
to
the
day
fixed
for
the
wedding
on
more
than
one
such
occasion
he
had
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
the
seemingly
jocular
question
how
do
you
know
i
am
not
married
already
but
he
never
let
the
sentence
cross
his
lips
and
would
instead
observe
facetiously
that
he
was
not
shtruck
on
nu
goil
and
that
he
was
dead
struck
on
all
of
them
in
whulshale
i
hate

beesnesh
shee
a
kin
a
man
am
one
day
in
the
course
of
an
intimate
conversation
with
joe
jake
dropping
into
a
philosophical
mood
remarked
it
something
like
a
baker
the
more
he
has
the
less
he
likes
them
you
and
i
have
a
of
girls
that
why
we
do
for
any
one
of
them
but
if
his
attachment
for
the
girls
of
his
acquaintance
collectively
was
not
coupled
with
a
quivering
of
his
heart
for
any
individual
mamie
or
fanny
or
sarah
it
did
not
on
the
other
hand
preclude
a
certain
lingering
tenderness
for
his
wife
but
then
his
wife
had
long
since
ceased
to
be
what
she
had
been
of
yore
from
a
reality
she
had
gradually
become
transmuted
into
a
fancy
during
the
three
years
since
he
had
set
foot
on
the
soil
where
a
shister
becomes
a
mister
and
a
mister
a
shister
he
had
lived
so
much
more
than
three
years
so
much
more
in
fact
than
in
all
the
years
of
his
previous
life
that
his
russian
past
appeared
to
him
a
dream
and
his
wife
and
child
together
with
his
former
self
in
a
charming
tale
which
he
was
neither
willing
to
banish
from
his
memory
nor
able
to
reconcile
with
the
actualities
of
his
american
present
the
question
of
how
to
effect
this
reconciliation
and
of
causing
gitl
and
little
yosselé
to
step
out
of
the
thickening
haze
of
reminiscence
and
to
take
their
stand
by
his
side
as
living
parts
of
his
daily
life
was
a
fretful
subject
from
the
consideration
of
which
he
cowardly
shrank
he
wished
he
could
both
import
his
family
and
continue
his
present
mode
of
life
at
the
bottom
of
his
soul
he
wondered
why
this
should
not
be
feasible
but
he
knew
that
it
was
not
and
his
heart
would
sink
at
the
notion
of
forfeiting
the
lion
share
of
attentions
for
which
he
came
in
at
the
hands
of
those
who
lionized
him
moreover
how
will
he
look
people
in
the
face
in
view
of
the
lie
he
has
been
acting
he
longed
for
an
interminable
respite
but
as
sooner
or
later
the
minds
of
his
acquaintances
were
bound
to
become
disabused
and
he
would
have
to
face
it
all
out
anyway
he
was
many
a
time
on
the
point
of
making
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
failed
to
do
so
for
a
mere
lack
of
nerve
each
time
letting
himself
off
on
the
plea
that
a
week
or
two
before
his
arrival
would
be
a
more
auspicious
occasion
for
the
disclosure
yiddish
for
shoemaker
neither
jake
nor
his
wife
nor
his
parents
could
write
even
yiddish
although
both
he
and
his
old
father
read
fluently
the
punctuated
hebrew
of
the
old
testament
or
the
their
correspondence
had
therefore
to
be
carried
on
by
proxy
and
as
a
consequence
at
longer
intervals
than
would
have
been
the
case
otherwise
the
missives
which
he
received
differed
materially
in
length
style
and
degree
of
illiteracy
as
well
as
in
point
of
penmanship
but
they
all
agreed
in
containing
glowing
encomiums
of
little
yosselé
exhorting
yekl
not
to
stray
from
the
path
of
righteousness
and
reproachfully
asking
whether
he
ever
meant
to
send
the
ticket
the
latter
point
had
an
exasperating
effect
on
jake
there
were
times
however
when
it
would
touch
his
heart
and
elicit
from
him
his
threadbare
vow
to
send
the
ticket
at
once
but
then
he
never
had
money
enough
to
redeem
it
and
to
tell
the
truth
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
was
at
such
moments
rather
glad
of
his
poverty
at
all
events
the
man
who
wrote
jake
letters
had
a
standing
order
to
reply
in
the
sharpest
terms
at
his
command
that
yekl
did
not
spend
his
money
on
drink
that
america
was
not
the
land
they
took
it
for
where
one
could
scoop
gold
by
the
skirtful
that
gitl
need
not
fear
lest
he
meant
to
desert
her
and
that
as
soon
as
he
had
saved
enough
to
pay
her
way
and
to
set
up
a
decent
establishment
she
would
be
sure
to
get
the
ticket
jake
scribe
was
an
old
jew
who
kept
a
little
stand
on
pitt
street
which
is
one
of
the
thoroughfares
and
market
places
of
the
galician
quarter
of
the
ghetto
and
where
jake
was
unlikely
to
come
upon
any
people
of
his
acquaintance
the
old
man
scraped
together
his
livelihood
by
selling
yiddish
newspapers
and
cigarettes
and
writing
letters
for
a
charge
varying
according
to
the
length
of
the
epistle
from
five
to
ten
cents
each
time
jake
received
a
letter
he
would
take
it
to
the
galician
who
would
first
read
it
to
him
for
an
extra
remuneration
of
one
cent
and
then
proceed
to
pen
five
cents
worth
of
rhetoric
which
might
have
been
printed
and
forwarded
one
copy
at
a
time
for
all
the
additions
or
alterations
jake
ever
caused
to
be
made
in
it
what
else
shall
i
write
the
old
man
would
ask
his
patron
after
having
written
and
read
aloud
the
first
dozen
lines
which
jake
had
come
to
know
by
heart
how
do
know
jake
would
respond
it
is
you
who
can
write
so
you
ought
to
understand
what
else
to
write
and
the
scribe
would
go
on
to
write
what
he
had
written
on
almost
every
previous
occasion
jake
would
keep
the
letter
in
his
pocket
until
he
had
spare
united
states
money
enough
to
convert
into
ten
rubles
and
then
he
would
betake
himself
to
the
draft
office
and
have
the
amount
together
with
the
epistle
forwarded
to
povodye
and
so
it
went
month
in
and
month
out
the
first
letter
which
reached
jake
after
the
scene
at
joe
dancing
academy
came
so
unusually
close
upon
its
predecessor
that
he
received
it
from
his
landlady
hand
with
a
throb
of
misgiving
he
had
always
laboured
under
the
presentiment
that
some
unknown
enemies
for
he
had
none
that
he
could
name
would
some
day
discover
his
address
and
anonymously
represent
him
to
her
as
contemplating
another
marriage
in
order
to
bring
gitl
down
upon
him
unawares
his
first
thought
accordingly
was
that
this
letter
was
the
outcome
of
such
a
conspiracy
or
maybe
there
is
some
death
in
the
family
he
next
reflected
half
with
terror
and
half
with
a
feeling
almost
amounting
to
reassurance
when
the
cigarette
vender
unfolded
the
letter
he
found
it
to
be
of
such
unusual
length
that
he
stipulated
an
additional
cent
for
the
reading
of
it
hurry
up
now
jake
said
grinding
his
teeth
on
a
mumbled
english
oath
evay
righd
evay
the
old
fellow
returned
jubilantly
as
he
hastily
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
addressed
himself
to
his
task
the
letter
had
evidently
been
penned
by
some
one
laying
claim
to
hebrew
scholarship
and
ambitious
to
impress
the
new
world
with
it
for
it
was
quite
replete
with
poetic
digressions
strained
and
twisted
to
suit
some
quotation
from
the
bible
and
what
with
this
unstinted
verbosity
which
was
greek
to
jake
one
or
two
interruptions
by
the
old
customers
and
interpretations
necessitated
by
difference
of
dialect
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
elapsed
before
the
scribe
realized
the
trend
of
what
he
was
reading
then
he
suddenly
gave
a
start
as
if
shocked
a
madder
a
madder
der
madder
what
should
be
the
wait
a
i
do
know
what
i
can
do
he
halted
in
perplexity
any
bad
news
jake
inquired
turning
pale
speak
out
speak
out
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
out
you
forget
that
one
is
a
piece
of
jew
he
faltered
hinting
at
the
orthodox
custom
which
enjoins
a
child
of
israel
from
being
the
messenger
of
sad
tidings
do
a
head
jake
shouted
savagely
i
have
paid
you
have
i
young
man
you
need
not
be
so
angry
the
other
said
resentfully
half
of
the
letter
i
have
read
have
i
not
so
i
shall
refund
you
one
cent
and
leave
me
in
peace
he
took
to
fumbling
in
his
pockets
for
the
coin
with
apparent
reluctance
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
jake
entreated
with
clinched
fists
is
anybody
dead
do
tell
me
now
since
you
know
it
already
i
may
as
well
tell
you
said
the
scribe
cunningly
glad
to
retain
the
cent
and
jake
patronage
it
is
your
father
who
has
been
freed
may
he
have
a
bright
paradise
ha
jake
asked
aghast
with
a
wide
gape
the
galician
resumed
the
reading
in
solemn
doleful
accents
the
melancholy
passage
was
followed
by
a
jeremiade
upon
the
penniless
condition
of
the
family
and
jake
duty
to
send
the
ticket
without
further
procrastination
as
to
his
mother
she
preferred
the
povodye
graveyard
to
a
watery
sepulchre
and
hoped
that
her
beloved
and
only
son
the
apple
of
her
eye
whom
she
had
been
awake
nights
to
bring
up
to
manhood
and
so
forth
would
not
forget
her
so
now
they
will
be
here
for
sure
and
there
can
be
no
more
delay
was
jake
first
distinct
thought
poor
father
he
inwardly
exclaimed
the
next
moment
with
deep
anguish
his
native
home
came
back
to
him
with
a
vividness
which
it
had
not
had
in
his
mind
for
a
long
time
was
he
an
old
man
the
scribe
queried
sympathetically
about
seventy
jake
answered
bursting
into
tears
seventy
then
he
had
lived
to
a
good
old
age
may
no
one
depart
younger
the
old
man
observed
by
way
of
consoling
the
bereaved
as
jake
tears
instantly
ran
dry
he
fell
to
wringing
his
hands
and
moaning
he
presently
said
taking
leave
i
see
you
if
god
be
pleased
the
scribe
returned
with
heartfelt
condolence
as
he
was
directing
his
steps
to
his
lodgings
jake
wondered
why
he
did
not
weep
he
felt
that
this
was
the
proper
thing
for
a
man
in
his
situation
to
do
and
he
endeavoured
to
inspire
himself
with
emotions
befitting
the
occasion
but
his
thoughts
teasingly
gambolled
about
among
the
people
and
things
of
the
street
however
he
became
sensible
of
his
mental
eye
being
fixed
upon
the
big
fleshy
mole
on
his
father
scantily
bearded
face
he
recalled
the
old
carriage
the
melancholy
nod
of
his
head
his
deep
sigh
upon
taking
snuff
from
the
birch
bark
which
jake
had
known
as
long
as
himself
and
his
heart
writhed
with
pity
and
with
the
acutest
pangs
of
homesickness
and
it
was
evening
and
it
was
morning
the
sixth
day
and
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
finished
as
the
hebrew
words
of
the
sanctification
of
the
sabbath
resounded
in
jake
ears
in
his
father
senile
treble
he
could
see
his
gaunt
figure
swaying
over
a
pair
of
sabbath
loaves
it
is
friday
night
the
little
room
made
tidy
for
the
day
of
rest
and
faintly
illuminated
by
the
mysterious
light
of
two
tallow
candles
rising
from
freshly
burnished
candlesticks
is
pervaded
by
a
benign
reposeful
warmth
and
a
general
air
of
peace
and
solemnity
there
seated
by
the
side
of
the
head
of
the
little
family
and
within
easy
reach
of
the
huge
brick
oven
is
his
old
mother
flushed
with
fatigue
and
with
an
effort
keeping
her
drowsy
eyes
open
to
attend
with
a
devout
mien
her
husband
prayer
opposite
to
her
by
the
window
is
yekl
the
present
jake
awaiting
his
turn
to
chant
the
same
words
in
the
holy
tongue
and
impatiently
thinking
of
the
repast
to
come
after
it
besides
the
three
of
them
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
chamber
for
jake
visioned
the
fascinating
scene
as
he
had
known
it
for
almost
twenty
years
and
not
as
it
had
appeared
during
the
short
period
since
the
family
had
been
joined
by
gitl
and
subsequently
by
yosselé
suddenly
he
felt
himself
a
child
the
only
and
pampered
son
of
a
doting
mother
he
was
overcome
with
a
consciousness
of
being
an
orphan
and
his
soul
was
filled
with
a
keen
sense
of
desolation
and
and
thereupon
everything
around
him
the
rows
of
gigantic
tenement
houses
the
hum
and
buzz
of
the
scurrying
pedestrians
the
jingling
horse
cars
all
suddenly
grew
alien
and
incomprehensible
to
jake
ah
if
he
could
return
to
his
old
home
and
old
days
and
have
his
father
recite
sanctification
again
and
sit
by
his
side
opposite
to
mother
and
receive
from
her
hand
a
plate
of
reeking
as
of
yore
poor
mother
he
not
forget
her
but
what
is
the
italian
playing
on
that
organ
anyhow
ah
it
is
the
new
waltz
by
the
way
this
is
monday
and
they
are
dancing
at
joe
now
and
he
is
not
there
i
shall
not
go
there
nor
any
other
night
he
commiserated
himself
his
reveries
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
left
the
pitt
street
cigarette
stand
passing
to
his
wife
and
child
her
image
now
stood
out
in
high
relief
with
the
multitudinous
noisy
scene
at
academy
for
a
discordant
disquieting
background
amid
which
there
vaguely
defined
itself
the
reproachful
saintlike
visage
of
the
deceased
i
will
begin
a
new
life
he
vowed
to
himself
a
kind
of
dessert
made
of
carrots
or
turnips
he
strove
to
remember
the
child
features
but
could
only
muster
the
faintest
recollection
scarcely
anything
beyond
a
general
symbol
a
red
little
thing
smiling
as
he
jake
tickles
it
under
its
tiny
chin
yet
jake
finger
at
this
moment
seemed
to
feel
the
soft
touch
of
that
little
chin
and
it
sent
through
him
a
thrill
of
fatherly
affection
to
which
he
had
long
been
a
stranger
gitl
on
the
other
hand
loomed
up
in
all
the
individual
sweetness
of
her
rustic
face
he
beheld
her
kindly
mouth
opening
wide
rather
too
wide
but
all
the
lovelier
for
it
as
she
spoke
her
prominent
red
gums
her
little
black
eyes
he
could
distinctly
hear
her
voice
with
her
peculiar
lisp
as
one
summer
morning
she
had
burst
into
the
house
and
clapping
her
hands
in
despair
she
had
cried
a
weeping
to
me
the
yellow
rooster
is
gone
or
as
coming
into
the
smithy
she
would
say
calls
you
to
dinner
hurry
up
yekl
dinner
is
ready
and
although
this
was
all
he
could
recall
her
saying
jake
thought
himself
retentive
of
every
word
she
had
ever
uttered
in
his
presence
his
heart
went
out
to
gitl
and
her
environment
and
he
was
seized
with
a
yearning
tenderness
that
made
him
feel
like
crying
i
would
not
exchange
her
little
finger
for
all
the
american
he
soliloquized
comparing
gitl
in
his
mind
with
the
girls
of
his
circle
it
now
filled
him
with
disgust
to
think
of
the
morals
of
some
of
them
although
it
was
from
his
own
sinful
experience
that
he
knew
them
to
be
of
a
rather
loose
character
he
reached
his
lodgings
in
a
devout
mood
and
before
going
to
bed
he
was
about
to
say
his
prayers
not
having
said
them
for
nearly
three
years
however
he
found
to
his
dismay
that
he
could
no
longer
do
it
by
heart
his
landlady
had
a
but
unfortunately
she
kept
it
locked
in
the
bureau
and
she
was
now
asleep
as
was
everybody
else
in
the
house
jake
reluctantly
undressed
and
went
to
bed
on
the
kitchen
lounge
where
he
usually
slept
when
a
boy
his
mother
had
taught
him
to
believe
that
to
go
to
sleep
at
night
without
having
recited
the
bed
prayer
rendered
one
liable
to
be
visited
and
choked
in
bed
by
some
ghost
later
when
he
had
grown
up
and
yet
before
he
had
left
his
birthplace
he
had
come
to
set
down
this
earnest
belief
of
his
good
old
mother
as
a
piece
of
womanish
superstition
while
since
he
had
settled
in
america
he
had
hardly
ever
had
an
occasion
to
so
much
as
think
of
bed
prayers
nevertheless
as
he
now
lay
vaguely
listening
to
the
weird
ticking
of
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
over
the
stove
and
at
the
same
time
desultorily
brooding
upon
his
father
death
the
old
belief
suddenly
uprose
in
his
mind
and
filled
him
with
mortal
terror
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
it
was
a
silly
notion
worthy
of
womenfolk
and
even
affected
to
laugh
at
it
audibly
but
all
in
vain
went
the
clock
and
the
form
of
a
man
in
white
burial
clothes
never
ceased
gleaming
in
his
face
he
resolutely
turned
to
the
wall
and
pulling
the
blanket
over
his
head
he
huddled
himself
snugly
up
for
instantaneous
sleep
but
presently
he
felt
the
cold
grip
of
a
pair
of
hands
about
his
throat
and
he
even
mentally
stuck
out
his
tongue
as
one
does
while
being
strangled
with
a
heart
jake
finally
jumped
off
the
lounge
and
gently
knocked
at
the
door
of
his
landlady
bedroom
me
be
so
kind
as
to
lend
me
your
i
want
to
say
the
night
prayer
he
addressed
her
imploringly
the
old
woman
took
it
for
a
cruel
practical
joke
and
flew
into
a
passion
are
you
crazy
or
drunk
a
nice
time
to
make
fun
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
said
with
suppliant
vehemence
may
i
as
surely
be
alive
as
my
father
is
dead
and
she
had
subjected
him
to
a
that
she
expressed
sympathy
and
went
to
produce
the
keys
chapter
iv
the
meeting
a
few
weeks
later
on
a
saturday
morning
jake
with
an
unfolded
telegram
in
his
hand
stood
in
front
of
one
of
the
desks
at
the
immigration
bureau
of
ellis
island
he
was
freshly
shaven
and
clipped
smartly
dressed
in
his
best
clothes
and
ball
shoes
and
in
spite
of
the
sickly
expression
of
shamefacedness
and
anxiety
which
distorted
his
features
he
looked
younger
than
usual
all
the
way
to
the
island
he
had
been
in
a
flurry
of
joyous
anticipation
the
prospect
of
meeting
his
dear
wife
and
child
and
incidentally
of
showing
off
his
swell
attire
to
her
had
thrown
him
into
a
fever
of
impatience
but
on
entering
the
big
shed
he
had
caught
a
distant
glimpse
of
gitl
and
yosselé
through
the
railing
separating
the
detained
immigrants
from
their
visitors
and
his
heart
had
sunk
at
the
sight
of
his
wife
uncouth
and
appearance
she
was
slovenly
dressed
in
a
brown
jacket
and
skirt
of
grotesque
cut
and
her
hair
was
concealed
under
a
voluminous
wig
of
a
hue
this
she
had
put
on
just
before
leaving
the
steamer
both
in
honour
of
the
sabbath
and
by
way
of
sprucing
herself
up
for
the
great
event
since
yekl
had
left
home
she
had
gained
considerably
in
the
measurement
of
her
waist
the
wig
however
made
her
seem
stouter
and
as
though
shorter
than
she
would
have
appeared
without
it
it
also
added
at
least
five
years
to
her
looks
but
she
was
aware
neither
of
this
nor
of
the
fact
that
in
new
york
even
a
jewess
of
her
station
and
orthodox
breeding
is
accustomed
to
blink
at
the
wickedness
of
displaying
her
natural
hair
and
that
none
but
an
elderly
matron
may
wear
a
wig
without
being
the
occasional
target
for
snowballs
or
stones
she
was
naturally
dark
of
complexion
and
the
nine
or
ten
days
spent
at
sea
had
covered
her
face
with
a
deep
bronze
which
combined
with
her
prominent
cheek
bones
inky
little
eyes
and
above
all
the
smooth
black
wig
to
lend
her
resemblance
to
a
squaw
jake
had
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
her
than
he
had
averted
his
face
as
if
loth
to
rest
his
eyes
on
her
in
the
presence
of
the
surging
crowd
around
him
before
it
was
inevitable
he
dared
not
even
survey
that
crowd
to
see
whether
it
contained
any
acquaintance
of
his
and
he
vaguely
wished
that
her
release
were
delayed
indefinitely
presently
the
officer
behind
the
desk
took
the
telegram
from
him
and
in
another
little
while
gitl
hugging
yosselé
with
one
arm
and
a
bulging
parcel
with
the
other
emerged
from
a
side
door
yekl
she
screamed
out
in
a
piteous
high
key
as
if
crying
for
mercy
alla
right
he
returned
in
english
with
a
wan
smile
and
unconscious
of
what
he
was
saying
his
wandering
eyes
and
dazed
mind
were
striving
to
fix
themselves
upon
the
stern
functionary
and
the
questions
he
bethought
himself
of
asking
before
finally
releasing
his
prisoners
the
contrast
between
gitl
and
jake
was
so
striking
that
the
officer
wanted
to
make
sure
partly
as
a
matter
of
official
duty
and
partly
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
that
the
two
were
actually
man
and
wife
a
lamentation
upon
me
he
shaves
his
beard
gitl
ejaculated
to
herself
as
she
scrutinized
her
husband
yosselé
look
here
is
but
yosselé
did
not
care
to
look
at
taté
instead
he
turned
his
frightened
little
eyes
precise
copies
of
jake
and
buried
them
in
his
mother
cheek
when
gitl
was
finally
discharged
she
made
to
fling
herself
on
jake
but
he
checked
her
by
seizing
both
loads
from
her
arms
he
started
for
a
distant
and
deserted
corner
of
the
room
bidding
her
follow
for
a
moment
the
boy
looked
stunned
then
he
burst
out
crying
and
fell
to
kicking
his
father
chest
with
might
and
main
his
reddened
little
face
appealingly
turned
to
gitl
jake
continuing
his
way
tried
to
kiss
his
son
into
toleration
but
the
little
fellow
proved
too
nimble
for
him
it
was
in
vain
that
gitl
scurrying
behind
kept
expostulating
with
yosselé
why
it
is
taté
taté
was
forced
to
capitulate
before
the
march
was
brought
to
its
end
at
length
when
the
secluded
corner
had
been
reached
and
jake
and
gitl
had
set
down
their
burdens
husband
and
wife
flew
into
mutual
embrace
and
fell
to
kissing
each
other
the
performance
had
an
effect
of
something
done
to
order
which
it
must
be
owned
was
far
from
being
belied
by
the
state
of
their
minds
at
the
moment
their
kisses
imparted
the
taste
of
mutual
estrangement
to
both
in
jake
case
the
sensation
was
quickened
by
the
strong
steerage
odours
which
were
emitted
by
gitl
person
and
he
involuntarily
recoiled
you
look
like
a
she
said
shyly
yiddish
for
nobleman
how
are
you
how
is
mother
how
should
she
be
so
so
she
sends
you
her
love
gitl
mumbled
out
how
long
was
father
ill
maybe
a
month
he
cost
us
health
enough
he
proceeded
to
make
advances
to
yosselé
she
appealing
to
the
child
in
his
behalf
for
a
moment
the
sight
of
her
as
they
were
both
crouching
before
the
boy
precipitated
a
wave
of
thrilling
memories
on
jake
and
made
him
feel
in
his
old
environment
presently
however
the
illusion
took
wing
and
here
he
was
jake
the
yankee
with
this
bonnetless
wigged
dowdyish
little
greenhorn
by
his
side
that
she
was
his
wife
nay
that
he
was
a
married
man
at
all
seemed
incredible
to
him
the
sturdy
thriving
urchin
had
at
first
inspired
him
with
pride
but
as
he
now
cast
another
side
glance
at
gitl
wig
he
lost
all
interest
in
him
and
began
to
regard
him
together
with
his
mother
as
one
great
obstacle
dropped
from
heaven
as
it
were
in
his
way
gitl
on
her
part
was
overcome
with
a
feeling
akin
to
awe
she
too
could
not
get
herself
to
realize
that
this
stylish
young
man
shaved
and
dressed
as
in
povodye
is
only
some
young
nobleman
was
yekl
her
own
yekl
who
had
all
these
three
years
never
been
absent
from
her
mind
and
while
she
was
once
more
examining
jake
blue
diagonal
cutaway
glossy
collar
the
white
necktie
coquettishly
tucked
away
in
the
bosom
of
his
starched
shirt
and
above
all
his
patent
leather
shoes
she
was
at
the
same
time
mentally
scanning
the
yekl
of
three
years
before
the
latter
alone
was
hers
and
she
felt
like
crying
to
the
image
to
come
back
to
her
and
let
her
be
wife
presently
when
they
had
got
up
and
jake
was
plying
her
with
perfunctory
questions
she
chanced
to
recognise
a
certain
movement
of
his
upper
lip
an
old
trick
of
his
it
was
as
if
she
had
suddenly
discovered
her
own
yekl
in
an
apparent
stranger
and
with
another
pitiful
outcry
she
fell
on
his
breast
do
he
said
with
patient
gentleness
pushing
away
her
arms
here
everything
is
so
different
she
coloured
deeply
they
do
wear
wigs
here
he
ventured
to
add
what
then
she
asked
perplexedly
you
will
see
it
is
quite
another
world
shall
i
take
it
off
then
i
have
a
nice
saturday
kerchief
she
faltered
it
is
of
silk
i
bought
it
at
kalmen
for
a
bargain
it
is
still
brand
new
here
one
does
not
wear
even
a
kerchief
how
then
do
they
go
about
with
their
own
hair
she
queried
in
bewilderment
alla
put
it
on
quick
as
she
set
about
undoing
her
parcel
she
bade
him
face
about
and
screen
her
so
that
neither
he
nor
any
stranger
could
see
her
bareheaded
while
she
was
replacing
the
wig
by
the
kerchief
he
obeyed
all
the
while
the
operation
lasted
he
stood
with
his
gaze
on
the
floor
gnashing
his
teeth
with
disgust
and
shame
or
hissing
some
bowery
oath
is
this
better
she
asked
bashfully
when
her
hair
and
part
of
her
forehead
were
hidden
under
a
kerchief
of
flaming
blue
and
yellow
whose
end
dangled
down
her
back
the
kerchief
had
a
rejuvenating
effect
but
jake
thought
that
it
made
her
look
like
an
italian
woman
of
mulberry
street
on
sunday
leave
it
be
for
the
present
he
said
in
despair
reflecting
that
the
wig
would
have
been
the
lesser
evil
of
the
two
when
they
reached
the
city
gitl
was
shocked
to
see
him
lead
the
way
to
a
horse
car
woe
is
me
why
it
is
sabbath
she
gasped
he
irately
essayed
to
explain
that
a
car
being
an
uncommon
sort
of
vehicle
riding
in
it
implied
no
violation
of
the
holy
day
but
this
she
sturdily
met
by
reference
to
railroads
besides
she
had
seen
horse
cars
while
stopping
in
hamburg
and
knew
that
no
orthodox
jew
would
use
them
on
the
seventh
day
at
length
jake
losing
all
fiercely
commanded
her
not
to
make
him
the
of
the
people
on
the
street
and
to
get
in
without
further
ado
as
to
the
sin
of
the
matter
he
was
willing
to
take
it
all
upon
himself
completely
dismayed
by
his
stern
manner
amid
the
strange
uproarious
forbidding
surroundings
gitl
yielded
as
the
horses
started
she
uttered
a
groan
of
consternation
and
remained
looking
aghast
and
with
a
violently
throbbing
heart
if
she
had
been
a
culprit
on
the
way
to
the
gallows
she
could
not
have
been
more
terrified
than
she
was
now
at
this
her
first
ride
on
the
day
of
rest
the
conductor
came
up
for
their
fares
jake
handed
him
a
piece
and
raising
two
fingers
he
roared
out
two
he
ain
no
maur
as
tree
years
de
liddle
feller
and
so
great
was
the
impression
which
his
dashing
manner
and
his
english
produced
on
gitl
that
for
some
time
it
relieved
her
mind
and
she
even
forgot
to
be
shocked
by
the
sight
of
her
husband
handling
coin
on
the
sabbath
having
thus
paraded
himself
before
his
wife
jake
all
at
once
grew
kindly
disposed
toward
her
you
must
be
hungry
he
asked
not
at
all
where
do
you
eat
your
yiddish
for
dinner
do
say
varimess
he
corrected
her
complaisantly
here
it
is
called
and
what
if
one
becomes
fatter
she
confusedly
ventured
an
irresistible
pun
yiddish
for
thinner
this
was
the
way
in
which
gitl
came
to
receive
her
first
lesson
in
the
five
or
six
score
english
words
and
phrases
which
the
omnivorous
jewish
jargon
has
absorbed
in
the
ghettos
of
countries
chapter
a
paterfamilias
it
was
early
in
the
afternoon
of
gitl
second
wednesday
in
the
new
world
jake
bernstein
and
charley
their
two
boarders
were
at
work
yosselé
was
sound
asleep
in
the
lodgers
double
bed
in
the
smallest
of
the
three
tiny
rooms
which
the
family
rented
on
the
second
floor
of
one
of
a
row
of
tenement
houses
gitl
was
by
herself
in
the
little
front
room
which
served
the
quadruple
purpose
of
kitchen
dining
room
sitting
room
and
parlour
she
wore
a
skirt
and
a
loose
jacket
of
white
russian
calico
decorated
with
huge
gay
figures
and
her
dark
hair
was
only
half
covered
by
a
bandana
of
red
and
yellow
this
was
gitl
compromise
between
her
conscience
and
her
husband
she
panted
to
yield
to
jake
demands
completely
but
could
not
nerve
herself
up
to
going
about
in
her
own
hair
like
a
gentile
woman
even
the
expostulations
of
kavarsky
the
childless
woman
who
occupied
with
her
husband
the
three
rooms
across
the
narrow
hallway
failed
to
prevail
upon
her
nevertheless
jake
succumbing
to
kavarsky
annoying
solicitations
had
bought
his
wife
a
cheap
hat
utterly
unfit
to
be
worn
over
her
voluminous
wig
and
even
a
corset
gitl
could
not
be
coaxed
into
accompanying
them
to
the
store
but
the
eloquent
neighbour
had
persuaded
jake
that
her
presence
at
the
transaction
was
not
indispensable
after
all
leave
it
to
me
she
said
i
know
what
will
become
her
and
what
wo
i
get
her
a
hat
that
will
make
a
fifth
avenue
lady
of
her
and
you
shall
see
if
she
does
not
give
in
if
she
is
then
not
to
go
with
her
own
hair
what
then
would
take
place
kavarsky
left
unsaid
the
hat
and
the
corset
had
been
lying
in
the
house
now
three
days
and
the
neighbour
predictions
had
not
yet
come
true
save
for
prying
once
or
twice
into
the
pasteboard
boxes
in
which
those
articles
lay
otherwise
unmolested
on
the
shelf
over
her
bed
the
door
was
open
gitl
stood
toying
with
the
knob
of
the
electric
bell
and
deriving
much
delight
from
the
way
the
street
door
latch
kept
clicking
under
her
magic
touch
two
flights
above
finally
she
wearied
of
her
diversion
and
shutting
the
door
she
went
to
take
a
look
at
yosselé
she
found
him
fast
asleep
and
as
she
was
retracing
her
steps
through
her
own
and
jake
bedroom
her
eye
fell
upon
the
paper
boxes
she
got
up
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
and
lifting
the
cover
from
the
hatbox
she
took
a
prolonged
look
at
its
contents
all
at
once
her
face
brightened
up
with
temptation
she
went
to
fasten
the
hallway
door
of
the
kitchen
on
its
latch
and
then
regaining
the
bedroom
shut
herself
in
after
a
lapse
of
some
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
she
attired
in
her
brown
holiday
dress
in
which
she
had
first
confronted
jake
on
ellis
island
and
with
the
tall
black
straw
hat
on
her
head
walking
on
tiptoe
as
though
about
to
commit
a
crime
she
crossed
over
to
the
then
she
paused
her
eyes
on
the
door
to
listen
for
possible
footsteps
hearing
none
she
faced
the
glass
quite
a
she
thought
to
herself
all
aglow
with
excitement
a
smile
at
once
shamefaced
and
beatific
melting
her
features
she
turned
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
to
view
herself
in
profile
as
she
had
seen
kavarsky
do
and
drew
back
a
step
to
ascertain
the
effect
of
the
corset
to
tell
the
truth
the
corset
proved
utterly
impotent
against
the
baggy
shapelessness
of
the
povodye
garment
yet
gitl
found
it
to
work
wonders
and
readily
pardoned
it
for
the
very
uncomfortable
sensation
which
it
caused
her
she
viewed
herself
again
and
again
and
was
in
a
flutter
both
of
ecstasy
and
alarm
when
there
came
a
timid
rap
on
the
door
trembling
all
over
she
scampered
on
tiptoe
back
into
the
bedroom
and
after
a
little
she
returned
in
her
calico
dress
and
bandana
kerchief
the
knock
at
the
door
had
apparently
been
produced
by
some
peddler
or
beggar
for
it
was
not
repeated
yet
so
violent
was
gitl
agitation
that
she
had
to
sit
down
on
the
haircloth
lounge
for
breath
and
to
regain
composure
a
young
noblewoman
what
is
it
they
call
this
she
presently
asked
herself
gazing
at
the
bare
boards
of
the
floor
floor
she
recalled
much
to
her
and
that
she
further
examined
herself
as
she
fixed
her
glance
on
the
ceiling
this
time
the
answer
was
slow
in
coming
and
her
heart
grew
faint
and
what
was
it
yekl
called
that
transferring
her
eyes
to
the
window
veen
neev
veenda
she
at
last
uttered
exultantly
the
evening
before
she
had
happened
to
call
it
in
spite
of
jake
repeated
corrections
ca
you
say
he
had
growled
what
a
peasant
head
other
learn
to
speak
american
very
fast
and
she
one
might
tell
her
the
same
word
eighty
thousand
times
and
it
is
is
veenda
mein
she
hastened
to
set
herself
right
it
is
on
the
window
i
meant
to
say
she
blushed
as
she
said
it
but
at
the
moment
she
attached
no
importance
to
the
matter
and
took
no
more
notice
of
it
now
however
jake
tone
of
voice
as
he
had
rebuked
her
backwardness
in
picking
up
american
yiddish
came
back
to
her
and
she
grew
dejected
she
was
getting
used
to
her
husband
in
whom
her
own
yekl
and
jake
the
stranger
were
by
degrees
merging
themselves
into
one
undivided
being
when
the
hour
of
his
coming
from
work
drew
near
she
would
every
little
while
consult
the
clock
and
become
impatient
with
the
slow
progress
of
its
hands
although
mixed
with
this
impatience
there
was
a
feeling
of
apprehension
lest
the
supper
prepared
as
it
was
under
culinary
conditions
entirely
new
to
her
should
fail
to
please
jake
and
the
boarders
she
had
even
become
accustomed
to
address
her
husband
as
jake
without
reddening
in
the
face
and
what
is
more
was
getting
to
tolerate
herself
being
called
by
him
goitie
gertie
a
word
phonetically
akin
to
yiddish
for
gentile
for
the
rest
she
was
too
inexperienced
and
too
naturally
to
comment
upon
his
manner
toward
her
she
had
not
altogether
overcome
her
awe
of
him
but
as
he
showed
her
occasional
marks
of
kindness
she
was
upon
the
whole
rather
content
with
her
new
situation
now
however
as
she
thus
sat
in
solitude
with
his
harsh
voice
ringing
in
her
ears
and
his
icy
look
before
her
a
feeling
of
suspicion
darkened
her
soul
she
recalled
other
scenes
where
he
had
looked
and
spoken
as
he
had
done
the
night
before
he
must
hate
me
a
pain
upon
me
she
concluded
with
a
fallen
heart
she
wondered
whether
his
demeanour
toward
her
was
like
that
of
other
people
who
hated
their
wives
she
remembered
a
woman
of
her
native
village
who
was
known
to
be
thus
afflicted
and
she
dropped
her
head
in
a
fit
of
despair
at
one
moment
she
took
a
firm
resolve
to
pluck
up
courage
and
cast
away
the
kerchief
and
the
wig
but
at
the
next
she
reflected
that
god
would
be
sure
to
punish
her
for
the
terrible
sin
so
that
instead
of
winning
jake
love
the
change
would
increase
his
hatred
for
her
it
flashed
upon
her
mind
to
call
upon
some
good
jew
to
pray
for
the
return
of
his
favour
or
to
seek
some
old
polish
beggar
woman
who
could
prescribe
a
love
potion
but
then
alas
who
knows
whether
there
are
in
this
terrible
america
any
good
jews
or
beggar
women
with
love
potions
at
all
better
she
had
never
known
this
black
year
of
a
country
here
everybody
says
she
is
green
what
an
ugly
word
to
apply
to
people
she
had
never
been
green
at
home
and
here
she
had
suddenly
become
so
what
do
they
mean
by
it
anyhow
verily
one
might
turn
green
and
yellow
and
gray
while
young
in
such
a
dreadful
place
her
heart
was
wrung
with
the
most
excruciating
pangs
of
homesickness
and
as
she
thus
sat
brooding
and
listlessly
surveying
her
new
surroundings
the
iron
stove
the
stationary
washtubs
the
window
opening
vertically
the
fire
escape
the
yellowish
broom
with
its
painted
handle
things
which
she
had
never
dreamed
of
at
her
birthplace
these
objects
seemed
to
stare
at
her
haughtily
and
inspired
her
with
fright
even
the
burnished
cup
of
the
electric
bell
knob
looked
contemptuously
and
seemed
to
call
her
greenhorn
greenhorn
lord
of
the
world
where
am
i
she
whispered
with
tears
in
her
voice
the
dreary
solitude
terrified
her
and
she
instinctively
rose
to
take
refuge
at
yosselé
bedside
as
she
got
up
a
vague
doubt
came
over
her
whether
she
should
find
there
her
child
at
all
but
yosselé
was
found
safe
and
sound
enough
he
was
rubbing
his
eyes
and
announcing
the
advent
of
his
famous
appetite
she
seized
him
in
her
arms
and
covered
his
warm
cheeks
with
fervent
kisses
which
did
her
aching
heart
good
and
as
she
admiringly
watched
the
boy
making
savage
inroads
into
a
generous
slice
of
rye
bread
she
thought
of
jake
affection
for
the
child
whereupon
things
began
to
assume
a
brighter
aspect
and
she
presently
set
about
preparing
supper
with
a
lighter
heart
although
her
countenance
for
some
time
retained
its
mournful
expression
meanwhile
jake
sat
at
his
machine
merrily
pushing
away
at
a
cloak
and
singing
to
it
some
of
the
popular
american
songs
of
the
day
the
sensation
caused
by
the
arrival
of
his
wife
and
child
had
nearly
blown
over
peltner
dancing
school
he
had
not
visited
since
a
week
or
two
previous
to
gitl
landing
as
to
the
scene
which
had
greeted
him
in
the
shop
after
the
stirring
news
had
first
reached
it
he
had
faced
it
out
with
much
more
courage
and
got
over
it
with
much
less
difficulty
than
he
had
anticipated
did
i
ever
tell
you
i
was
a
he
laughingly
defended
himself
though
blushing
crimson
against
his
shopmates
taunts
and
am
i
obliged
to
give
you
a
whether
my
wife
has
come
or
not
you
are
not
worth
mentioning
her
name
to
the
boss
then
suggested
that
jake
celebrate
the
event
with
two
pints
of
beer
the
motion
being
seconded
by
the
presser
who
volunteered
to
fetch
the
beverage
jake
obeyed
with
alacrity
and
if
there
had
still
lingered
any
trace
of
awkwardness
in
his
position
it
was
soon
washed
away
by
the
foaming
liquid
as
a
matter
of
fact
fanny
embarrassment
was
much
greater
than
jake
the
stupefying
news
was
broken
to
her
on
the
very
day
of
arrival
after
passing
a
sleepless
night
she
felt
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
face
jake
in
the
presence
of
her
other
shopmates
to
whom
her
feelings
for
him
were
an
open
secret
as
luck
would
have
it
it
was
sunday
the
beginning
of
a
new
working
week
in
the
metropolitan
ghetto
and
she
went
to
look
for
a
job
in
another
place
jake
at
once
congratulated
himself
upon
her
absence
and
missed
her
but
then
he
equally
missed
the
company
of
mamie
and
of
all
the
other
girls
whose
society
and
attentions
now
more
than
ever
seemed
to
him
necessities
of
his
life
they
haunted
his
mind
day
and
night
he
almost
never
beheld
them
in
his
imagination
except
as
clustering
together
with
his
and
making
merry
over
him
and
his
wife
and
the
vision
pierced
his
heart
with
shame
and
jealousy
all
his
achievements
seemed
wiped
out
by
a
sudden
stroke
of
ill
fate
he
thought
himself
a
martyr
an
innocent
exile
from
a
world
to
which
he
belonged
by
right
and
he
frequently
felt
the
sobs
of
mounting
to
his
throat
for
several
minutes
at
a
time
while
kicking
at
his
treadle
he
would
see
reddening
before
him
gitl
bandana
kerchief
and
her
prominent
gums
or
hear
an
piece
of
yiddish
pronounced
with
gitl
peculiar
lisp
that
very
lisp
which
three
years
ago
he
used
to
mimic
fondly
but
which
now
grated
on
his
nerves
and
was
apt
to
make
his
face
twitch
with
sheer
disgust
insomuch
that
he
often
found
a
vicious
relief
in
mocking
that
lisp
of
hers
audibly
over
his
work
but
can
it
be
that
he
is
doomed
for
life
no
no
he
would
revolt
conscious
at
the
same
time
that
there
was
really
no
escape
ah
may
she
be
killed
the
horrid
greenhorn
he
would
gasp
to
himself
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
and
then
he
would
bewail
his
lost
youth
and
curse
all
russia
for
his
premature
marriage
presently
however
he
would
recall
the
plump
spunky
face
of
his
son
who
bore
such
close
resemblance
to
himself
to
whom
he
was
growing
more
strongly
attached
every
day
and
who
was
getting
to
prefer
his
company
to
his
mother
and
thereupon
his
heart
would
soften
toward
gitl
and
he
would
gradually
feel
the
qualms
of
pity
and
remorse
and
make
a
vow
to
treat
her
kindly
never
min
he
would
at
such
instances
say
in
his
heart
she
will
herself
and
i
shall
get
used
to
her
she
is
a
better
than
all
the
girls
and
he
would
inspire
himself
with
respect
for
her
spotless
purity
and
take
comfort
in
the
fact
of
her
being
a
model
housewife
undiverted
from
her
duties
by
any
thoughts
of
balls
or
picnics
and
despite
a
deeper
consciousness
which
exposed
his
readiness
to
sacrifice
it
all
at
any
time
he
would
work
himself
into
a
dignified
feeling
as
the
head
of
a
household
and
the
father
of
a
promising
son
and
soothe
himself
with
the
additional
consolation
that
sooner
or
later
the
other
fellows
of
joe
academy
would
also
be
married
a
verb
coined
from
the
yiddish
out
and
the
english
and
signifying
to
cease
being
green
on
the
wednesday
in
question
jake
and
his
shopmates
had
warded
off
a
reduction
of
wages
by
threatening
a
strike
and
were
accordingly
in
high
feather
and
so
jake
and
bernstein
came
home
in
unusually
good
spirits
little
joey
for
such
was
yosselé
name
now
with
whom
his
father
plays
were
for
the
most
part
of
an
athletic
character
welcomed
jake
by
a
challenge
for
a
pugilistic
encounter
and
the
way
he
said
coom
a
fight
and
held
out
his
little
fists
so
delighted
podkovnik
that
upon
ordering
gitl
to
serve
supper
he
vouchsafed
a
fillip
on
the
tip
of
her
nose
while
she
was
hurriedly
setting
the
table
jake
took
to
describing
to
charley
his
employer
defeat
you
should
have
seen
how
he
looked
the
cockroach
he
said
he
became
as
pale
as
the
wall
and
his
teeth
were
chattering
as
if
he
had
been
shaken
up
with
fever
my
and
how
quiet
he
became
all
of
a
sudden
as
if
he
could
not
count
two
one
might
apply
him
to
an
ulcer
so
soft
was
he
he
laughed
looking
to
bernstein
who
smiled
assent
at
last
supper
was
announced
bernstein
donned
his
hat
and
did
not
sit
down
to
the
repast
before
he
had
performed
his
ablutions
and
whispered
a
short
prayer
as
he
did
so
jake
and
charley
interchanged
a
wink
as
to
themselves
they
dispensed
with
all
devotional
preliminaries
and
took
their
seats
with
uncovered
heads
gitl
also
washed
her
fingers
and
said
the
prayer
and
as
she
handed
yosselé
his
first
slice
of
bread
she
did
not
release
it
before
he
had
recited
the
benediction
bernstein
who
as
a
rule
looked
daggers
at
his
meal
this
time
received
his
plate
of
his
favourite
dish
with
a
radiant
face
and
as
he
ate
he
pronounced
it
a
masterpiece
and
lavished
compliments
on
the
artist
a
sour
soup
of
cabbage
and
beets
it
a
long
time
since
i
tasted
such
a
borshtch
simply
a
vivifier
it
melts
in
every
limb
he
kept
rhapsodizing
between
mouthfuls
it
ought
to
be
sent
to
the
chicago
exposition
the

get
a
medal

european
borshtch
charley

beaming
with
pride

she
added
demurely

with
teeth
jested
charlie
i
tell
you
it

a
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
was
submerged
in
a
mouthful
of
the
vivifying
right
jake
bethought
himself
him
ten
for
each
spoonful
bernstein
you
shall
be
kind
enough
to
be
the
but
if
you
do
pay
chollie

get
out
a
summons
from
whereat
the
little
kitchen
rang
with
laughter
in
which
all
participated
except
bernstein
even
joey
or
yosselé
joined
in
the
general
outburst
of
merriment
otherwise
he
was
busily
engaged
cramming
borshtch
into
his
mouth
and
in
passing
also
into
his
nose
with
both
his
plump
hands
for
a
pair
of
spoons
from
time
to
time
he
would
interrupt
operations
to
make
a
wry
face
and
blinking
his
eyes
to
lisp
out
rapturously
sour
look
may
you
live
long
do
look
he
is
laughing
too
gitl
called
attention
to
yosselé
bespattered
face
to
think
of
such
a
crumb
having
as
much
sense
as
that
she
was
positive
that
he
appreciated
his
father
witticism
although
she
herself
understood
it
but
vaguely
may
he
know
evil
no
better
than
he
knows
what
he
is
laughing
at
jake
objected
with
a
fatherly
mien
what

boy

no
time

before

of
his
doting
grandmother

how
well

jake
said
facetiously
a
better
than
his
mamma
gitl
who
was
in
the
meantime
serving
the
meat
coloured
but
took
the
remark
in
good
part

charlie
interposed
that

jake
explained
ai
it
mr
bernstein
it
a
pity
then
that
he
was
not
born
in
this
country
bernstein
replied
his
eye
envyingly
fixed
now
on
gitl
now
at
the
child
on
whose
plate
she
was
at
this
moment
carving
a
piece
of
meat
into
tiny
morsels
if
he
can
not
be
a
president
of
the
united
states
he
may

of

she
turned
her
head
to

the
future

bernstein
demurred
i
wish

had
a
boy

married
and
you
will
have
one
said
gitl
beamingly
bernstein
how
about
your
jake
queried
he
gave
a
laugh
but
forthwith
checked
it
remaining
with
an
embarrassed
grin
on
his
face
as
though
anxious
to
swallow
the
question
bernstein
blushed
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
bent
an
irate
glance
on
his
plate
but
held
his
peace
a
matrimonial
agent
his
reserved
manner
if
not
his
superior
education
held
shopmates
at
a
respectful
distance
from
him
and
as
a
rule
rendered
him
proof
against
their
badinage
although
behind
his
back
they
would
indulge
an
occasional
joke
on
his
inferiority
as
a
workman
and
while
they
were
at
it
on
his
dyspepsia
his
books
and
staid
methodical
habits
recently
however
they
had
got
wind
of
his
clandestine
visits
to
a
marriage
broker
and
the
temptation
to
chaff
him
on
the
subject
had
proved
resistless
all
the
more
so
because
bernstein
whose
leading
foible
was
his
vanity
was
quick
to
take
offence
in
general
and
on
this
matter
in
particular
as
to
jake
he
was
by
no
means
averse
to
having
a
laugh
at
somebody
else
expense
but
since
bernstein
had
become
his
boarder
he
felt
that
he
could
not
afford
to
wound
his
pride
hence
his
regret
and
anxiety
at
his
allusion
to
the
matrimonial
agent
after
supper
charlie
went
out
for
the
evening
while
bernstein
retired
to
their
little
bedroom
gitl
busied
herself
with
the
dishes
and
jake
took
to
romping
about
with
joey
and
had
a
hearty
laugh
with
him
he
was
beginning
to
tire
of
the
boy
company
and
to
feel
lonesome
generally
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
coom
in
gitl
hastened
to
say
somewhat
coquettishly
flourishing
her
proficiency
in
american
manners
as
she
raised
her
head
from
the
pot
in
her
hands
coom
in
repeated
joey
the
door
flew
open
and
in
came
mamie
preceded
by
a
cloud
of
cologne
odours
she
was
apparently
dressed
for
some
occasion
of
state
for
she
was
powdered
and
and
resplendent
in
a
waist
of
blazing
red
gaudily
trimmed
and
with
puff
sleeves
each
wider
than
the
vast
expanse
of
white
straw
surmounted
with
a
whole
forest
of
ostrich
feathers
which
adorned
her
head
one
of
her
gloved
hands
held
the
huge
yellowish
handle
of
a
blue
parasol
jake
she
said
with
ostentatious
vivacity
mamie
jake
returned
jumping
to
his
feet
and
violently
reddening
as
if
suddenly
pricked
mish
fein
my
vife
my
vife
mish
fein
miss
fein
made
a
stately
bow
primly
biting
her
lip
as
she
did
so
gitl
with
the
pot
in
her
hands
stood
staring
sheepishly
at
a
loss
what
to
do
say
glyad
to
meech
you
jake
urged
her
confusedly
the
english
phrase
was
more
than
gitl
could
venture
to
echo
she
is
still
jake
apologized
for
her
in
yiddish
she
will
soon
herself
mamie
remarked
with
patronizing
affability
the
is
an
acquaintance
of
mine
jake
explained
bashfully
his
hand
feeling
the
few
days
growth
of
beard
on
his
chin
gitl
instinctively
scented
an
enemy
in
the
visitor
and
eyed
her
with
an
uneasy
gaze
nevertheless
she
mustered
a
hospitable
air
and
drawing
up
the
rocking
chair
she
said
with
shamefaced
cordiality
sit
down
why
should
you
be
standing
you
may
be
seated
for
the
same
money
in
the
conversation
which
followed
mamie
did
most
of
the
talking
with
a
nervous
volubility
often
broken
by
an
irrelevant
giggle
and
violently
rocking
with
her
chair
she
expatiated
on
the
charms
of
america
prophesying
that
her
hostess
would
bless
the
day
of
her
arrival
on
its
soil
and
went
off
in
ecstasies
over
joey
she
spoke
with
an
overdone
american
accent
in
the
dialect
of
the
polish
jews
affectedly
germanized
and
profusely
interspersed
with
english
so
that
gitl
whose
mother
tongue
was
lithuanian
yiddish
could
scarcely
catch
the
meaning
of
one
half
of
her
flood
of
garrulity
and
as
she
thus
rattled
on
she
now
examined
the
room
now
surveyed
gitl
from
head
to
foot
now
fixed
her
with
a
look
of
studied
sarcasm
followed
by
a
side
glance
at
jake
which
seemed
to
say
woe
to
you
what
a
rag
of
a
wife
yours
is
whenever
gitl
ventured
a
timid
remark
mamie
would
nod
assent
with
dignified
amiability
and
thereupon
imitate
a
smile
broad
yet
fleeting
which
she
had
seen
performed
by
some
uptown
ladies
jake
stared
at
the
lamp
with
a
faint
simper
scarcely
following
the
caller
words
his
head
swam
with
embarrassment
the
consciousness
of
gitl
unattractive
appearance
made
him
sick
with
shame
and
vexation
and
his
eyes
carefully
avoided
her
bandana
as
a
culprit
schoolboy
does
the
evidence
of
his
offence
you
mush

he
presently
nerved
himself
up
to

an
awkward
pause

besought

in
the
meanwhile
gitl
poor
thing
sat
pale
and
perfumes
somehow
terrified
her
she
was
racked
with
jealousy
and
all
sorts
of
suspicions
which
she
vainly
struggled
to
disguise
she
could
see
that
they
were
having
a
heated
altercation
and
that
jake
was
begging
about
something
or
other
and
was
generally
the
under
dog
in
the
parley
ever
and
anon
she
strained
her
ears
in
the
effort
to
fasten
some
of
the
incomprehensible
sounds
in
her
memory
that
she
might
subsequently
parrot
them
over
to
kavarsky
and
ascertain
their
meaning
but
alas
the
attempt
proved
futile
never
min
and
all
right
being
all
she
could
catch
mamie
concluded
her
visit
by
presenting
joey
with
the
imposing
sum
of
five
cents
what
do
you
say
say
sir
gitl
prompted
the
boy
shay
you
jake
overruled
her
is
said
to
a
gentlemarn
mamie
sang
out
as
she
majestically
opened
the
door
jake
returned
with
a
burning
face
gitl
and
joey
chimed
in
duet
say
again
cullye
gain
mamie
said
once
more
as
she
bowed
herself
out
of
the
door
with
what
she
considered
an
exquisitely
tony
smile
the
guest
exit
was
succeeded
by
a
momentary
silence
jake
felt
as
if
his
face
and
ears
were
on
fire
we
used
to
work
in
the
same
shop
he
presently
said
is
that
the
way
a
seamstress
dresses
in
america
gitl
inquired
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
it
is
called
the
golden
land
she
added
with
timid
irony
she
must
be
going
to
a
ball
he
explained
at
the
same
moment
casting
a
glance
at
the
the
word
ball
had
an
imposing
ring
for
gitl
ears
at
home
she
had
heard
it
used
in
connection
with
the
sumptuous
life
of
the
russian
or
polish
nobility
but
had
never
formed
a
clear
idea
of
its
meaning
she
looks
a
veritable
she
remarked
with
hidden
sarcasm
was
she
born
here
a
young
noblewoman
but
she
has
been
very
long
here
she
speaks
english
like
one
american
born
we
are
used
to
speak
in
english
when
we
talk
she
came
to
ask
me
about
a
gitl
reflected
that
with
bernstein
jake
was
in
the
habit
of
talking
shop
in
yiddish
although
the
boarder
could
even
read
english
books
which
her
husband
could
not
do
chapter
vi
circumstances
alter
cases
jake
was
left
by
mamie
in
a
state
of
unspeakable
misery
he
felt
discomfited
crushed
the
universal
butt
of
ridicule
her
perfumes
lingered
in
his
nostrils
taking
his
breath
away
her
venomous
gaze
stung
his
heart
she
seemed
to
him
elevated
above
the
social
plane
upon
which
he
had
recently
though
the
interval
appeared
very
long
stood
by
her
side
nay
upon
which
he
had
had
her
at
his
beck
and
call
while
he
was
degraded
as
it
were
wallowing
in
a
mire
from
which
he
yearningly
looked
up
to
his
former
equals
vainly
begging
for
recognition
an
uncontrollable
desire
took
possession
of
him
to
run
after
her
to
have
an
explanation
and
to
swear
that
he
was
the
same
jake
and
as
much
of
a
yankee
and
a
gallant
as
ever
but
here
was
his
wife
fixing
him
with
a
timid
piteous
look
which
at
once
exasperated
and
cowed
him
and
he
dared
not
stir
out
of
the
house
as
though
nailed
by
that
look
of
hers
to
the
spot
he
lay
down
on
the
lounge
and
shut
his
eyes
gitl
dutifully
brought
him
a
pillow
as
she
adjusted
it
under
his
head
the
touch
of
her
hand
on
his
face
made
him
shrink
as
if
at
the
contact
with
a
reptile
he
was
anxious
to
flee
from
his
wretched
self
into
oblivion
and
his
wish
was
soon
gratified
the
combined
effect
of
a
hard
day
work
and
a
plentiful
and
supper
plunging
him
into
a
heavy
sleep
while
his
snores
resounded
in
the
little
kitchen
gitl
put
the
child
to
bed
and
then
passed
with
noiseless
step
into
the
boarders
room
the
door
was
ajar
and
she
entered
it
without
knocking
as
was
her
wont
she
found
bernstein
bent
over
a
book
with
a
ponderous
dictionary
by
its
side
a
kerosene
lamp
with
a
red
shade
occupying
nearly
all
the
remaining
space
on
the
table
spread
a
lurid
mysterious
light
gitl
asked
the
studious
cloakmaker
whether
he
knew
a
polish
girl
named
mamie
fein
mamie
fein
no
why
said
bernstein
with
his
index
finger
on
the
passage
he
had
been
reading
and
his
eyes
on
gitl
plumpish
cheek
bathed
in
the
roseate
light
nothing
may
not
one
ask
what
is
the
matter
speak
out
are
you
afraid
to
tell
me
he
insisted
what
should
be
the
matter
she
was
here
a
nice
your
husband
knows
many
nice
he
said
with
a
faint
but
significant
smile
and
immediately
regretting
the
remark
he
went
on
to
smooth
it
down
by
characterizing
jake
as
an
honest
and
fellow
you
ought
to
think
yourself
fortunate
in
having
him
for
your
husband
he
added
yes
but
what
did
you
mean
by
what
you
said
first
she
demanded
with
an
anxious
air
what
did
i
mean
what
should
i
have
meant
i
meant
what
i
said
he
knows
many
girls
but
who
does
not
you
know
there
are
always
girls
in
the
shops
where
we
work
never
fear
jake
has
nothing
to
do
with
them
who
says
i
fear
did
i
say
i
did
why
should
i
encouraged
by
the
cheering
effect
which
his
words
were
obviously
having
on
the
credulous
unsophisticated
woman
he
pursued
may
no
jewish
daughter
have
a
worse
husband
be
easy
be
easy
i
tell
you
he
is
melting
away
for
you
he
never
looked
as
happy
as
he
does
since
you
came
go
away
you
must
be
making
fun
of
me
she
said
beaming
with
delight
do
you
believe
me
why
are
you
not
a
pretty
young
woman
he
remarked
with
an
oily
look
in
his
eye
the
crimson
came
into
her
cheek
and
she
lowered
her
glance
stop
making
fun
of
me
i
beg
you
she
said
softly
is
it
true
is
what
true
that
you
are
a
pretty
young
woman
take
a
and
see
for
yourself
strange
man
that
you
are
she
returned
with
confused
deprecation
i
mean
what
you
said
before
about
jake
she
faltered
oh
about
jake
then
say
so
he
jested
really
he
loves
you
as
life
how
do
you
know
she
queried
wistfully
how
do
i
know
he
repeated
with
an
amused
smile
as
if
one
could
not
see
but
he
never
told
you
himself
how
do
you
know
he
did
not
you
have
guessed
wrongly
see
he
did
lots
of
times
he
concluded
gravely
touched
by
the
anxiety
of
the
poor
woman
she
left
bernstein
room
all
thrilling
with
joy
and
repentant
for
her
excess
of
communicativeness
a
wife
must
not
tell
other
people
what
happens
to
her
husband
she
lectured
herself
in
the
best
of
humours
still
the
words
your
husband
knows
many
nice
kept
echoing
at
the
bottom
of
her
soul
and
in
another
few
minutes
she
was
at
kavarsky
confidentially
describing
mamie
visit
as
well
as
her
talk
with
the
boarder
omitting
nothing
save
the
latter
compliments
to
her
looks
kavarsky
was
an
eccentric
scraggy
little
woman
with
a
vehement
manner
and
no
end
of
words
and
gesticulations
her
dry
face
was
full
of
warts
and
surmounted
by
a
chaotic
mass
of
ringlets
and
curls
of
a
faded
brown
none
too
tidy
about
her
person
and
rather
slattern
in
general
appearance
she
zealously
kept
up
the
cleanliness
for
which
the
fame
of
her
apartments
reached
far
and
wide
her
neighbours
and
townsfolk
pronounced
her
crazy
but
with
a
heart
of
diamond
that
is
to
say
the
diametrical
opposite
of
the
precious
stone
in
point
of
hardness
and
resembling
it
in
the
general
sense
of
excellence
of
quality
she
was
neighbourly
enough
and
as
she
was
the
most
prosperous
and
her
establishment
the
best
equipped
in
the
whole
tenement
many
a
woman
would
come
to
borrow
some
cooking
utensil
or
other
or
even
a
few
dollars
on
rent
day
which
kavarsky
always
started
by
refusing
in
the
most
pointed
terms
and
almost
always
finished
by
granting
she
started
to
listen
to
gitl
report
with
a
fierce
mien
which
gradually
thawed
into
a
sage
smile
when
the
young
neighbour
had
rested
her
case
she
first
nodded
her
head
as
who
should
say
what
fools
this
young
generation
be
and
then
burst
out
do
you
know
what
have
to
tell
you
guess
gitl
thought
heaven
knows
what
revelations
awaited
her
that
you
are
a
lump
of
horse
and
a
greenhorn
and
nothing
else
gitl
felt
much
relieved
that
piece
of
ugliness
should
and
come
to
house
then
she
would
know
the
price
of
a
pound
of
evil
i
should
open
the
door
and
to
eighty
black
years
let
her
go
to
where
she
came
from
america
is
not
russia
thanked
be
the
lord
of
the
world
here
one
must
only
know
how
to
handle
a
husband
here
a
husband
must
remember
but
then
you
do
not
even
know
what
that
means
she
exclaimed
with
a
despairing
wave
of
her
hand
what
does
it
mean
gitl
inquired
pensively
what
does
it
mean
what
should
it
mean
it
means
but
too
well
it
means
that
when
a
husband
does
not
as
he
should
one
does
not
stroke
his
cheeks
for
it
a
prohibition
upon
me
if
one
does
if
the
wife
is
no
greenhorn
she
gets
him
shoved
into
the
oven
over
there
across
the
river
you
mean
they
send
him
to
prison
where
else
to
the
theatre
kavarsky
mocked
her
furiously
a
weeping
to
me
gitl
said
with
horror
may
god
save
me
from
such
things
in
due
course
kavarsky
arrived
at
the
subject
of
and
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
she
elicited
from
her
pupil
a
promise
to
discard
the
kerchief
and
to
sell
the
wig
no
wonder
he
does
hate
you
seeing
you
in
that
horrid
rag
which
makes
a
grandma
of
you
drop
it
i
tell
you
drop
it
so
that
no
survivor
nor
any
refugee
is
left
of
it
if
you
do
obey
me
this
time
dare
not
cross
my
threshold
any
more
do
you
hear
she
thundered
one
might
as
well
talk
to
the
wall
as
to
her
she
proceeded
actually
addressing
herself
to
the
opposite
wall
of
her
kitchen
and
referring
to
her
interlocutrice
in
the
third
person
i
am
working
and
working
for
her
and
here
she
appreciates
it
as
much
as
the
cat
fie
with
which
the
irate
lady
averted
her
face
in
disgust
i
shall
take
it
off
now
for
sure
as
sure
as
this
is
wednesday
said
gitl
beseechingly
kavarsky
turned
back
to
her
pacified
remember
now
if
you
disappoint
me
this
time
well
look
at
me
i
should
think
i
was
no
gentile
woman
either
i
am
as
pious
as
you
and
come
from
no
mean
family
either
you
know
i
hate
to
boast
my
father
peace
be
upon
him
was
fit
to
be
a
rabbi
and
yet
i
am
not
afraid
to
go
with
my
own
hair
may
no
greater
sins
be
committed
then
it
would
be
enough
plenty
of
time
for
putting
on
the
patch
meaning
the
wig
when
i
get
old
as
long
as
i
am
young
i
am
young
dot
it
can
not
be
helped
when
one
lives
in
an
country
one
must
live
like
as
they
play
so
one
dances
as
the
saying
is
but
i
think
it
is
time
for
you
to
be
going
go
my
little
kitten
kavarsky
said
suddenly
lapsing
into
accents
of
the
most
tender
affection
he
may
be
up
by
this
time
and
wanting
go
my
little
lamb
go
and
to
make
yourself
agreeable
to
him
and
the
uppermost
will
help
in
america
one
must
take
care
not
to
displease
a
husband
here
one
is
in
new
york
and
in
chicago
do
you
understand
as
if
there
were
any
shame
or
decency
here
a
father
is
no
father
a
wife
no
wife
go
now
my
baby
go
and
throw
away
your
rag
and
be
a
nice
woman
and
everything
will
be
and
so
hurrying
gitl
to
go
she
detained
her
with
ever
a
fresh
torrent
of
loquacity
for
another
ten
minutes
till
the
young
woman
standing
on
pins
and
needles
and
scarcely
lending
an
ear
plucked
up
courage
to
plead
her
household
duties
and
take
a
hasty
departure
she
found
jake
fast
asleep
it
was
after
eleven
when
he
slowly
awoke
he
got
up
with
a
heavy
burden
on
his
soul
a
vague
sense
of
having
met
with
some
horrible
rebuff
in
his
semiconsciousness
he
was
unaware
however
of
his
wife
and
son
existence
and
of
the
change
which
their
advent
had
produced
in
his
life
feeling
himself
the
same
free
bird
that
he
had
been
a
fortnight
ago
he
stared
about
the
room
as
if
wondering
where
he
was
noticing
gitl
who
at
that
moment
came
out
of
the
bedroom
he
instantly
realized
the
situation
recalling
mamie
hat
perfumes
and
all
and
his
heart
sank
within
him
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
became
stifling
to
him
after
sitting
on
the
lounge
for
some
time
with
a
drooping
head
he
was
tempted
to
fling
himself
on
the
pillow
again
but
instead
of
doing
so
he
slipped
on
his
hat
and
coat
and
went
out
gitl
was
used
to
his
goings
and
comings
without
explanation
yet
this
time
his
slam
of
the
door
sent
a
sharp
pang
through
her
heart
she
had
no
doubt
but
that
he
was
bending
his
steps
to
another
interview
with
the
polish
witch
as
she
mentally
branded
miss
fein
nor
was
she
mistaken
for
jake
did
start
mechanically
in
the
direction
of
chrystie
street
where
mamie
lodged
he
felt
sure
that
she
was
away
to
some
ball
but
the
very
house
in
which
she
roomed
seemed
to
draw
him
with
magnetic
force
moreover
he
had
a
lurking
hope
that
he
might
after
all
find
her
about
the
building
ah
if
by
a
stroke
of
good
luck
he
came
upon
her
on
the
street
all
he
wished
was
to
have
a
talk
and
that
for
the
sole
purpose
of
amending
her
unfavourable
impression
of
him
then
he
would
never
so
much
as
think
of
mamie
for
indeed
she
was
hateful
to
him
he
persuaded
himself
arrived
at
his
destination
and
failing
to
find
mamie
on
the
sidewalk
he
was
tempted
to
wait
till
she
came
from
the
ball
when
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
sense
of
the
impropriety
of
his
expedition
and
he
forthwith
returned
home
deciding
in
his
mind
as
he
walked
to
move
with
his
wife
and
child
to
chicago
meanwhile
mamie
lay
brooding
in
her
in
the
parlour
which
she
shared
with
her
landlady
two
daughters
she
was
in
the
most
wretched
frame
of
mind
ineffectually
struggling
to
fall
asleep
she
had
made
her
way
down
the
stairs
leading
from
the
podkovniks
with
a
violently
palpitating
heart
she
had
been
bound
for
no
more
imposing
a
place
than
joe
academy
and
before
repairing
thither
she
had
had
to
betake
herself
home
to
change
her
stately
toilet
for
a
humbler
attire
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
expressly
for
her
visit
to
the
podkovniks
that
she
had
thus
pranked
herself
out
and
that
would
have
been
much
too
gorgeous
an
appearance
to
make
at
joe
establishment
on
one
of
its
regular
dancing
evenings
having
changed
her
toilet
she
did
call
at
joe
but
so
full
was
her
mind
of
jake
and
his
wife
and
accordingly
she
was
so
irritable
that
in
the
middle
of
a
quadrille
she
picked
a
quarrel
with
the
dancing
master
and
abruptly
left
the
hall
the
next
day
jake
work
fared
badly
when
it
was
at
last
over
he
did
not
go
direct
home
as
usual
but
first
repaired
to
mamie
he
found
her
with
her
landlady
in
the
kitchen
she
looked
careworn
and
was
in
a
white
blouse
which
lent
her
face
a
convalescent
touching
effect
bunetzky
mamie
he
fairly
roared
as
he
playfully
fillipped
his
hat
backward
and
after
addressing
a
pleasantry
or
two
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
he
boldly
proposed
to
her
boarder
to
go
out
with
him
for
a
talk
for
a
moment
mamie
hesitated
fearing
lest
her
landlady
had
become
aware
of
the
existence
of
a
podkovnik
but
instantly
flinging
all
considerations
to
the
wind
she
followed
him
out
into
the
street
afraid
i
vould
pay
you
mamie
he
began
with
bravado
in
spite
of
his
intention
to
start
on
a
different
line
he
knew
not
exactly
which
mamie
was
no
less
disappointed
by
the
opening
of
the
conversation
than
he
i
ai
afraid
a
bit
she
answered
sullenly
do
you
think
my
are
larger
now
he
resumed
in
yiddish
may
i
lose
as
much
through
sickness
on
the
countrary
i
even
much
less
than
i
used
to
we
have
two
nice
boarders
i
keep
them
only
for
company
sake
and
i
have
a
puddin
of
a
i
shall
have
still
more
money
to
he
added
falteringly
outside
and
she
burst
into
an
artificial
laugh
which
sent
the
blood
to
jake
face
why
do
you
think
i
go
to
joe
nor
to
the
theatre
nor
anywhere
any
more
still
oftener
than
before
much
vill
you
bet
a
married
man
a
papa
go
to
a
dancing
school
not
unless
your
wife
drags
along
with
you
and
never
lets
go
of
your
skirts
she
said
sneeringly
adding
the
declaration
that
jake
bluffs
gave
her
a
regula
pain
in
de
neck
jake
writhing
under
her
lashes
protested
his
freedom
as
emphatically
as
he
could
but
it
only
served
to
whet
mamie
spite
and
against
her
will
she
went
on
twitting
him
as
a
henpecked
husband
and
an
jew
finally
she
reverted
to
the
subject
of
his
debt
whereupon
he
took
fire
and
after
an
interchange
of
threats
and
some
quite
forcible
language
they
parted
company
from
that
evening
the
spectre
of
mamie
dressed
in
her
white
blouse
almost
unremittingly
preyed
on
jake
mind
the
mournful
sneer
which
had
lit
her
pale
face
on
their
last
interview
when
she
wore
that
blouse
relentlessly
stared
down
into
his
heart
gnawed
at
it
with
tantalizing
deliberation
drew
out
his
soul
as
he
once
put
it
to
himself
dropping
his
arms
and
head
in
despair
is
this
what
they
call
love
he
wondered
thinking
of
the
strange
hitherto
unexperienced
kind
of
malady
which
seemed
to
be
gradually
consuming
his
whole
being
he
felt
as
if
mamie
had
breathed
a
delicious
poison
into
his
veins
which
was
now
taking
effect
spreading
a
devouring
fire
through
his
soul
and
kindling
him
with
a
frantic
thirst
for
more
of
the
same
virus
his
features
became
distended
as
it
were
and
acquired
a
feverish
effect
his
eyes
had
a
pitiable
beseeching
look
like
those
of
a
child
in
the
period
of
teething
he
grew
more
irritable
with
gitl
every
day
the
energy
failing
him
to
dissemble
his
hatred
for
her
there
were
moments
when
in
his
hopeless
craving
for
the
presence
of
mamie
he
would
consciously
seek
refuge
in
a
feeling
of
compunction
and
of
pity
for
his
wife
and
on
several
such
occasions
he
made
an
effort
to
take
an
affectionate
tone
with
her
but
the
unnatural
sound
of
his
voice
each
time
only
accentuated
to
himself
the
depth
of
his
repugnance
while
the
hysterical
promptness
of
her
answers
the
servile
gratitude
which
trembled
in
her
voice
and
shone
out
of
her
radiant
face
would
at
such
instances
make
him
breathless
with
rage
poor
gitl
she
strained
every
effort
to
please
him
she
tried
to
charm
him
by
all
the
little
coquetries
she
knew
by
every
art
which
her
artless
brain
could
invent
and
only
succeeded
in
making
herself
more
offensive
than
ever
as
to
jake
feelings
for
joey
they
now
alternated
between
periods
of
indifference
and
gusts
of
exaggerated
affection
while
in
some
instances
when
the
boy
let
himself
be
fondled
by
his
mother
or
returned
her
caresses
in
his
childish
way
he
would
appear
to
jake
as
siding
with
his
enemy
and
share
with
gitl
his
father
odium
one
afternoon
shortly
after
jake
interview
with
mamie
in
front
of
the
chrystie
street
tenement
house
fanny
called
on
gitl
are
you
mrs
podkovnik
she
inquired
with
an
embarrassed
air
yes
why
podkovnik
replied
turning
pale
she
is
come
to
tell
me
that
jake
has
eloped
with
that
polish
girl
flashed
upon
her
overwrought
mind
at
the
same
moment
fanny
sizing
her
up
exclaimed
inwardly
so
this
is
the
kind
of
woman
she
is
poor
thing
nothing
i
want
to
speak
to
you
the
visitor
uttered
mysteriously
what
is
it
as
i
say
nothing
at
all
is
there
nobody
else
in
the
house
fanny
demanded
looking
about
may
i
not
live
till
if
there
is
a
living
soul
except
my
boy
and
he
is
asleep
you
may
speak
never
fear
but
first
tell
me
who
you
are
do
not
take
ill
my
question
be
seated
the
girl
appearance
and
manner
began
to
inspire
gitl
with
confidence
my
name
is
rosy
rosy
blank
said
fanny
as
she
took
a
seat
on
the
further
end
of
the
lounge
you
do
know
me
how
should
you
but
i
know
you
well
enough
never
mind
that
we
have
never
seen
each
other
before
i
used
to
work
with
your
husband
in
one
shop
i
have
come
to
tell
you
such
an
important
thing
you
must
know
it
it
makes
no
difference
that
you
do
know
who
i
am
may
god
grant
me
as
good
a
year
as
my
friendship
is
for
you
something
about
jake
gitl
blurted
out
all
anxiety
and
instantly
regretted
the
question
how
did
you
guess
about
jake
it
is
about
him
and
somebody
else
but
see
how
you
did
guess
swear
that
you
wo
tell
anybody
that
i
have
been
here
may
i
be
left
speechless
may
my
arms
and
legs
be
paralyzed
if
i
ever
say
a
word
gitl
recited
vehemently
thrilling
with
anxiety
and
impatience
so
it
is
they
have
eloped
she
added
in
her
heart
seating
herself
close
to
her
caller
a
darkness
upon
my
years
what
will
become
of
me
and
yosselé
now
remember
now
not
a
word
either
to
jake
or
to
anybody
else
in
the
world
i
had
a
mountain
of
before
i
found
out
where
you
lived
and
i
work
on
purpose
to
come
and
speak
to
you
as
true
as
you
see
me
alive
i
wanted
to
call
when
i
was
sure
to
find
you
alone
you
understand
is
there
really
nobody
about
and
after
a
preliminary
glance
at
the
door
and
exacting
another
oath
of
discretion
from
podkovnik
fanny
began
in
an
undertone
there
is
a
girl
well
her
name
is
mamie
well
she
and
your
husband
used
to
go
to
the
same
dancing
school
that
is
a
place
where
and
learn
to
dance
she
explained
i
go
there
too
but
i
know
your
husband
from
the
shop
but
that
has
also
worked
in
the
same
shop
with
him
she
gitl
broke
in
with
a
desolate
look
in
her
eye
why
did
jake
tell
you
she
had
fanny
asked
in
surprise
no
not
at
all
not
at
all
i
am
just
asking
may
i
be
sick
if
i
know
anything
the
idea
how
could
they
work
together
seeing
that
she
is
a
shirtmaker
and
he
a
cloakmaker
ah
if
you
knew
what
a
witch
she
is
she
has
set
her
mind
on
your
husband
and
is
bound
to
take
him
away
from
you
she
hitched
on
to
him
long
ago
but
since
you
came
i
thought
she
would
have
god
in
her
heart
and
be
ashamed
of
people
not
she
she
be
ashamed
you
may
sling
a
cat
into
her
face
and
she
wo
mind
it
the
black
year
knows
where
she
grew
up
i
tell
you
there
is
not
a
girl
in
the
whole
dancing
school
but
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
that
polish
lizard
why
do
they
meet
and
kiss
gitl
moaned
out
tell
me
do
tell
me
all
my
little
crown
keep
nothing
from
me
tell
me
my
whole
dark
lot
but
be
sure
not
to
speak
to
anybody
i
tell
you
the
truth
my
name
is
not
rosy
blank
at
all
it
is
fanny
scutelsky
you
see
i
am
telling
you
the
whole
truth
the
other
evening
they
stood
near
the
house
where
she
on
chrystie
street
so
they
were
looking
into
each
other
eyes
and
talking
like
a
pair
of
little
doves
a
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
saw
them
so
she
says
a
child
could
have
guessed
that
she
was
making
love
to
him
and
to
get
him
away
from
you
it
is
none
of
my
is
it
my
then
what
do
it
is
only
i
pity
you
it
is
like
the
nature
i
have
i
can
not
bear
to
see
anybody
in
trouble
other
people
would
not
but
i
do
such
is
my
nature
so
i
thought
to
myself
i
must
go
and
tell
podkovnik
all
about
it
in
order
that
she
might
know
what
to
do
for
several
moments
gitl
sat
speechless
her
head
hung
down
and
her
bosom
heaving
rapidly
then
she
fell
to
swaying
her
frame
sidewise
and
vehemently
wringing
her
hands
oi
little
mother
a
pain
to
me
she
moaned
what
is
to
be
done
lord
of

people
do
take
pity
come
to
the

she
broke
into
a
fit
of
low
sobbing
which
shook
her
whole
form
and
was
followed
by
a
torrent
of
tears
whereupon
fanny
also
burst
out
crying
and
falling
upon
gitl
shoulder
she
murmured
my
little
heart
you
do
know
what
a
friend
i
am
to
you
oh
if
you
knew
what
a
serpent

thief

chapter
vii
kavarsky
coup
it
was
not
until
after
supper
time
that
gitl
could
see
kavarsky
for
the
neighbour
husband
was
in
the
installment
business
and
she
generally
spent
all
day
in
helping
him
with
his
collections
as
well
as
canvassing
for
new
customers
when
gitl
came
in
to
unburden
herself
of
fanny
revelations
she
found
her
confidante
out
of
sorts
something
had
gone
wrong
in
kavarsky
affairs
and
while
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
she
had
only
herself
to
blame
she
had
laid
it
all
to
her
husband
and
had
nagged
him
out
of
the
house
before
he
had
quite
finished
his
supper
she
listened
to
her
neighbour
story
with
a
bored
and
impatient
air
and
when
gitl
had
concluded
and
paused
for
her
opinion
she
remarked
languidly
it
serves
you
right
it
is
all
you
will
not
throw
away
that
ugly
kerchief
of
yours
what
is
the
use
of
your
asking
my
advice
i
think
even
that
would
help
it
now
gitl
rejoined
forlornly
the
uppermost
knows
what
drug
she
has
charmed
him
with
a
cholera
into
her
lord
of
the
world
she
added
fiercely
kavarsky
lost
her
temper
will
you
stop
talking
nonsense
she
shouted
savagely
no
wonder
your
husband
does
not
for
you
seeing
these
stupid
greenhornlike
notions
of
yours
how
then
could
she
have
bewitched
him
the
witch
that
she
is
tell
me
little
heart
little
crown
do
tell
me
take
pity
and
be
a
mother
to
me
i
am
so
lonely
and
heartrending
sobs
choked
her
voice
what
shall
i
tell
you
that
you
are
a
blockhead
oi
oi
she
mocked
her
will
the
crying
help
you
cry
away
but
what
shall
i
do
gitl
pleaded
wiping
her
tears
it
may
drive
me
mad
i
wo
wear
the
kerchief
any
more
i
swear
this
is
the
last
day
she
added
propitiatingly
right
when
you
talk
like
a
man
i
like
you
and
now
sit
still
and
listen
to
what
an
older
person
and
a
business
woman
has
to
tell
you
in
the
first
place
who
knows
what
that
girl
jennie
fannie
shmennie
yomtzedemennie
whatever
you
may
call
her
is
after
the
last
two
names
kavarsky
invented
by
poetical
license
to
complete
the
rhyme
and
for
the
greater
emphasis
of
her
contempt
in
the
second
place
supposing
he
did
talk
to
that
polish
piece
of
disturbance
what
of
it
it
is
all
over
with
the
world
it
the
mourner
prayer
is
to
be
said
after
it
i
declare
a
married
man
stood
talking
to
a
girl
just
think
of
it
may
no
greater
evil
befall
any
yiddish
daughter
this
is
not
europe
where
one
dares
not
say
a
word
to
a
strange
woman
sir
what
then
is
the
matter
with
him
at
home
he
would
hardly
ever
leave
my
side
and
never
ceased
looking
into
my
eyes
woe
is
me
what
america
has
brought
me
to
and
again
her
grief
broke
out
into
a
flood
of
tears
this
time
kavarsky
was
moved
do
be
crying
my
child
he
may
come
in
for
you
she
said
affectionately
believe
me
you
are
making
a
mountain
out
of
a
fly
you
are
imagining
too
much
as
my
ill
luck
would
have
it
it
is
all
but
too
true
have
i
no
eyes
then
he
mocks
at
everything
i
say
or
do
he
can
not
bear
the
touch
of
my
hand
america
made
a
mountain
of
ashes
out
of
me
really
a
curse
upon
columbus
she
ejaculated
mournfully
quoting
in
all
earnestness
a
current
joke
of
the
ghetto
kavarsky
was
too
deeply
touched
to
laugh
she
proceeded
to
examine
her
pupil
in
whispers
upon
certain
details
and
thereupon
her
interest
in
gitl
answers
gradually
superseded
her
commiseration
for
the
unhappy
woman
and
how
does
he
behave
toward
the
boy
she
absently
inquired
after
a
melancholy
pause
would
he
were
as
kind
to
me
then
it
is
such
things
will
happen
between
man
and
wife
it
is
all
it
will
all
come
right
and
you
will
some
day
be
the
happiest
woman
in
the
world
you
shall
see
remember
that
kavarsky
has
told
you
so
and
in
the
meantime
stop
crying
a
husband
hates
a
sniveller
for
a
wife
you
know
the
story
of
jacob
and
leah
as
it
stands
written
in
the
holy
five
books
do
you
her
eyes
became
red
with
weeping
and
jacob
our
father
did
not
for
her
on
that
account
do
you
understand
all
at
once
kavarsky
bit
her
lip
her
countenance
brightening
up
with
a
sudden
inspiration
at
the
next
instant
she
made
a
lunge
at
gitl
head
and
off
went
the
kerchief
gitl
started
with
a
cry
at
the
same
moment
covering
her
head
with
both
hands
take
off
your
hands
take
them
off
at
once
i
say
the
other
shrieked
her
eyes
flashing
fire
and
her
feet
performing
an
irish
jig
gitl
obeyed
for
sheer
terror
then
pushing
her
toward
the
sink
kavarsky
said
peremptorily
you
shall
wash
off
your
silly
tears
and
i
arrange
your
hair
and
from
this
day
on
there
shall
be
no
kerchief
do
you
hear
gitl
offered
but
feeble
resistance
just
enough
to
set
herself
right
before
her
own
conscience
she
washed
herself
quietly
and
when
her
friend
set
about
combing
her
hair
she
submitted
to
the
operation
without
a
murmur
save
for
uttering
a
painful
hiss
each
time
there
came
a
particularly
violent
tug
at
the
comb
for
indeed
kavarsky
plied
her
weapon
rather
energetically
and
with
a
bloodthirsty
air
as
if
inflicting
punishment
and
while
she
was
thus
attacking
luxurious
raven
locks
she
kept
growling
as
glibly
as
the
progress
of
the
comb
would
allow
and
modulating
her
voice
to
its
movements
believe
me
you
are
a
lump
of
hunchback
you
may
may
depend
it
tell
me
now
do
you
ever
comb
yourself
you
have
raised
quite
a
plica
the
black
year
take
it
another
woman
would
thank
god
for
such
hair
and
here
she
keeps
it
hidden
and
makes
a
of
herself
a
she
concluded
gnashing
her
teeth
at
the
stout
resistance
with
which
her
implement
was
at
that
moment
grappling
gitl
heart
swelled
with
delight
but
she
modestly
kept
silent
suddenly
kavarsky
paused
thoughtfully
as
if
conceiving
a
new
idea
in
another
moment
a
pair
of
scissors
and
curling
irons
appeared
on
the
scene
at
the
sight
of
this
gitl
blood
ran
chill
and
when
the
scissors
gave
their
first
click
in
her
hair
she
felt
as
though
her
heart
snapped
nevertheless
she
endured
it
all
without
a
protest
blindly
trusting
that
these
instruments
of
torture
would
help
reinstall
her
in
jake
good
graces
at
last
when
all
was
ready
and
she
found
herself
adorned
with
a
pair
of
rich
side
bangs
she
was
taken
in
front
of
the
mirror
and
ordered
to
hail
the
transformation
with
joy
she
viewed
herself
with
an
unsteady
glance
as
if
her
own
face
struck
her
as
unfamiliar
and
forbidding
however
the
change
pleased
her
as
much
as
it
startled
her
do
you
really
think
he
will
like
it
she
inquired
with
piteous
eagerness
in
a
fever
of
conflicting
emotions
if
he
does
not
i
shall
refund
your
money
her
guardian
snarled
in
high
glee
for
a
moment
or
so
kavarsky
paused
to
admire
the
effect
of
her
art
then
in
a
sudden
transport
of
enthusiasm
she
sprang
upon
her
ward
and
with
an
a
health
to
you
she
smacked
a
hearty
kiss
on
her
burning
cheek
and
now
come
piece
of
wretch
so
saying
kavarsky
grasped
gitl
by
the
wrist
and
forcibly
convoyed
her
into
her
husband
presence
the
two
boarders
were
out
jake
being
alone
with
joey
he
was
seated
at
the
table
facing
the
door
with
the
boy
on
his
knees
podkovnik
look
what
i
have
brought
you
a
brand
new
wife
kavarsky
said
pointing
at
her
charge
who
stood
faintly
struggling
to
disengage
her
hand
from
her
escort
tight
grip
her
eyes
looking
to
the
ground
and
her
cheeks
a
vivid
crimson
gitl
unwonted
appearance
impressed
jake
as
something
unseemly
and
meretricious
the
sight
of
her
revolted
him
it
becomes
her
like
a
a
a
wet
cat
he
faltered
out
with
a
venomous
smile
choking
down
a
much
stronger
simile
which
would
have
conveyed
his
impression
with
much
more
precision
but
which
he
dared
not
apply
to
his
own
wife
the
boy
first
impulse
upon
the
entrance
of
his
mother
had
been
to
run
up
to
her
side
and
to
greet
her
merrily
but
he
too
was
shocked
by
the
change
in
her
aspect
and
he
remained
where
he
was
looking
from
her
to
jake
in
blank
surprise
go
away
you
do
mean
it
kavarsky
remonstrated
distressedly
at
the
same
moment
releasing
her
prisoner
who
forthwith
dived
into
the
bedroom
to
bury
her
face
in
a
pillow
and
to
give
way
to
a
stream
of
tears
then
she
made
a
few
steps
toward
jake
and
speaking
in
an
undertone
she
proceeded
to
take
him
to
task
another
man
would
consider
himself
happy
to
have
such
a
wife
she
said
such
a
quiet
honest
woman
and
such
a
housewife
why
look
at
the
way
she
keeps
everything
like
a
fiddle
it
is
simply
a
treat
to
come
into
your
house
i
do
declare
you
sin
what
do
i
do
to
her
he
protested
morosely
cursing
the
intruder
in
his
heart
who
says
you
do
mercy
and
peace
only
you
understand
how
shall
i
say
it
she
is
only
a
young
woman
so
she
imagines
that
you
do
not
for
her
as
much
as
you
used
to
come
podkovnik
you
know
you
are
a
sensible
man
i
have
always
thought
you
one
you
may
ask
my
husband
really
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
a
prohibition
upon
me
if
i
could
ever
have
believed
it
of
you
do
you
think
a
stylish
girl
would
make
you
a
better
wife
if
you
do
you
are
grievously
mistaken
what
are
they
good
for
the
hussies
to
darken
the
life
of
a
husband
that
i
admit
they
are
really
great
hands
at
they
only
know
how
to
squander
his
money
for
a
new
hat
or
rag
every
monday
and
thursday
and
to
tramp
around
with
other
men
fie
upon
the
abominations
may
no
good
jew
know
them
her
innuendo
struck
kavarsky
as
extremely
ingenious
and
egged
on
by
the
dogged
silence
of
her
auditor
she
ventured
a
step
further
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
she
went
on
emphasizing
each
word
and
shaking
her
whole
body
with
melodramatic
defiance
that
you
would
be
better
off
with
a
girl
girl
jake
repeated
turning
ashen
pale
and
fixing
his
inquisitress
with
a
distant
gaze
who
says
i
care
for
a
girl
he
bellowed
as
he
let
down
the
boy
and
started
to
his
feet
red
as
a
cockscomb
it
was
she
who
told
you
that
was
it
joey
had
tripped
up
to
the
lounge
where
he
now
stood
watching
his
father
with
a
stare
in
which
there
was
more
curiosity
than
fright
the
little
woman
lowered
her
crest
not
at
all
god
be
with
you
she
said
quickly
in
a
tone
of
abject
cowardice
and
involuntarily
shrinking
before
the
ferocious
attitude
of
jake
strapping
figure
who
what
when
i
did
not
mean
anything
at
all
gitl
said
a
word
to
me
a
prohibition
if
she
did
come
podkovnik
why
should
you
get
she
pursued
beginning
to
recover
her
presence
of
mind
i
came
near
forgetting
how
about
the
boarder
you
promised
to
get
me
do
you
remember
mr
podkovnik
talk
away
a
toothache
for
your
grandma
not
for
me
who
told
her
about
girls
he
thundered
again
the
ejaculation
with
an
english
oath
and
bringing
down
a
violent
fist
on
the
table
as
he
did
so
at
this
gitl
sobs
made
themselves
heard
from
the
bedroom
they
lashed
jake
into
a
still
greater
fury
what
is
she
whimpering
about
the
piece
of
stench
i
do
hate
her
i
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
her
and
let
her
do
what
she
likes
don
care
podkovnik
to
think
of
a
man
like
you
talking
in
this
way
alla
right
he
said
somewhat
relenting
i
do
for
any
girls
it
is
a
lie
it
was
that
scabby
who
must
have
taken
it
into
her
head
i
do
for
anybody
not
for
her
certainly
pointing
to
the
bedroom
i
am
an
a
that
what
i
am
what
punishment
is
due
to
me
then
if
i
can
not
stand
a
like
her
it
is
i
can
not
live
with
her
even
if
she
stand
one
foot
on
heaven
and
one
on
earth
let
her
take
everything
with
a
wave
at
the
household
effects
and
i
shall
pay
her
as
much
as
she
asks
i
am
willing
to
break
stones
to
pay
her
provided
she
agrees
to
a
divorce
the
word
had
no
sooner
left
his
lips
than
gitl
burst
out
of
the
darkness
of
her
retreat
her
bangs
dishevelled
her
face
stained
and
flushed
with
weeping
and
rage
and
her
eyes
still
suffused
with
tears
flashing
fire
may
you
and
your
polish
harlot
be
jumping
out
of
your
skins
and
chafing
with
wounds
as
long
as
you
will
have
to
wait
for
a
divorce
she
exploded
he
thinks
i
do
know
how
they
stand
together
near
her
house
making
love
to
each
other
her
unprecedented
show
of
pugnacity
took
him
aback
look
at
the
cossack
of
straw
he
said
quietly
with
a
forced
smile
such
a
piece
of
cholera
he
added
as
if
speaking
to
himself
as
he
resumed
his
seat
i
wonder
who
tells
her
all
these
fibs
gitl
broke
into
a
fresh
flood
of
tears
what
do
you
want
now
kavarsky
said
addressing
herself
to
her
he
says
it
is
a
lie
i
told
you
you
take
all
sorts
of
silly
notions
into
your
head
would
it
were
a
lie
gitl
answered
between
her
sobs
at
this
juncture
the
boy
stepped
up
to
his
mother
side
and
nestled
against
her
skirt
she
clasped
his
head
with
both
her
hands
as
though
gratefully
accepting
an
offer
of
succour
against
an
assailant
and
then
for
the
vague
purpose
of
wounding
jake
feelings
she
took
the
child
in
her
arms
and
huddling
him
close
to
her
bosom
she
half
turned
from
her
husband
as
much
as
to
say
we
two
are
making
common
cause
against
you
jake
was
cut
to
the
quick
he
kept
his
glance
fixed
on
the
reddened
profile
of
her
nose
and
choking
with
hate
he
was
going
to
say
for
my
part
hang
yourself
together
with
him
but
he
had
enough
to
repress
the
exclamation
confining
himself
to
a
disdainful
smile
children
children
woe
how
you
do
sin
kavarsky
sermonized
come
now
obey
an
older
person
whoever
takes
notice
of
such
trifles

have
had
a
quarrel
right
and
now
make
peace
have
an
embrace
and
a
good
kiss
and
podkovnik
do
be
ashamed
she
beckoned
to
him
her
countenance
wreathed
in
voluptuous
smiles
in
anticipation
of
the
love
scene
about
to
enact
itself
before
her
eyes
podkovnik
failing
to
hurry
up
however
she
went
on
disappointedly

arms
akimbo
he
must
think
i
too
can
be
scared
by
his
english
i
declare
my
shirt
has
turned
linen
for
fright
i
was
in
america
while
you
were
hauling
away
at
the
bellows
in
povodye
do
you
know
it
are
you
going
out
of
my
house
or
not
roared
jake
jumping
to
his
feet
and
if
i
am
not
what
will
you
do
will
you
call
a
do
that
is
just
what
i
want
i
shall
tell
him
i
can
not
leave
her
alone
with
a
murderer
like
you
for
fear
you
might
kill
her
and
the
boy
so
that
you
might
dawdle
around
with
that
polish
wench
of
yours
here
you
have
it
saying
which
she
put
her
thumb
between
her
index
and
third
finger
the
russian
version
of
the
gesture
of
contempt
presenting
it
to
her
adversary
together
with
a
generous
portion
of
her
tongue
jake
first
impulse
was
to
strike
the
meddlesome
woman
as
he
started
toward
her
however
he
changed
his
mind
you
may
remain
with
her
he
said
rushing
up
to
the
clothes
rack
and
slipping
on
his
coat
and
hat
he
repeated
with
broken
breath
we
shall
see
and
with
a
frantic
bang
of
the
door
he
disappeared
the
fresh
autumn
air
of
the
street
at
once
produced
its
salutary
effect
on
his
overexcited
nerves
as
he
grew
more
collected
he
felt
himself
in
a
most
awkward
muddle
he
cursed
his
outbreak
of
temper
and
wished
the
next
few
days
were
over
and
the
breach
healed
in
his
abject
misery
he
thought
of
suicide
of
fleeing
to
chicago
or
louis
all
of
which
passed
through
his
mind
in
a
stream
of
the
most
irrelevant
and
the
most
frivolous
reminiscences
he
was
burning
to
go
back
but
the
nerve
failing
him
to
face
kavarsky
he
wondered
where
he
was
going
to
pass
the
night
it
was
too
cold
to
be
tramping
about
till
it
was
time
to
go
to
work
and
he
had
not
change
enough
to
pay
for
a
night
rest
in
a
lodging
house
so
in
his
despair
he
fulminated
against
gitl
and
above
all
against
her
tutoress
having
passed
as
far
as
the
limits
of
the
ghetto
he
took
a
homeward
course
by
a
parallel
street
knowing
all
the
while
that
he
would
lack
the
courage
to
enter
his
house
when
he
came
within
sight
of
it
he
again
turned
back
yearningly
thinking
of
the
cosey
little
home
behind
him
and
invoking
maledictions
upon
gitl
for
enjoying
it
now
while
he
was
exposed
to
the
chill
air
without
the
prospect
of
shelter
for
the
night
as
he
thus
sauntered
reluctantly
about
he
meditated
upon
the
scenes
coming
in
his
way
and
upon
the
thousand
and
one
things
which
they
brought
to
his
mind
at
the
same
time
his
heart
was
thirsting
for
mamie
and
he
felt
himself
a
wretched
outcast
the
target
of
ridicule
a
martyr
paying
the
penalty
of
sins
which
he
failed
to
recognise
as
sins
or
of
which
at
any
rate
he
could
not
hold
himself
culpable
yes
he
will
go
to
chicago
or
to
baltimore
or
better
still
to
england
he
pictured
to
himself
the
sensation
it
would
produce
and
gitl
despair
it
will
serve
her
right
what
does
she
want
of
me
he
said
to
himself
revelling
in
a
sense
of
revenge
but
then
it
was
such
a
pity
to
part
with
joey
whereupon
in
his
reverie
jake
beheld
himself
stealing
into
his
house
in
the
dead
of
night
and
kidnapping
the
boy
and
what
would
mamie
say
would
she
not
be
sorry
to
have
him
disappear
can
it
be
that
she
does
not
care
for
him
any
longer
she
seemed
to
but
that
was
before
she
knew
him
to
be
a
married
man
and
again
his
heart
uttered
curses
against
gitl
ah
if
mamie
did
still
care
for
him
and
fainted
upon
hearing
of
his
flight
and
then
could
not
sleep
and
ran
around
wringing
her
hands
and
raving
like
mad
it
would
serve
right
too
she
should
have
come
to
tell
him
she
loved
him
instead
of
making
that
scene
at
his
house
and
taking
a
derisive
tone
with
him
upon
the
occasion
of
his
visit
to
her
still
should
she
come
to
join
him
in
london
he
would
receive
her
he
decided
magnanimously
they
speak
english
in
london
and
have
cloak
shops
like
here
so
he
would
be
no
greenhorn
there
and
would
they
be
happy
he
mamie
and
little
joey
or
supposing
his
wife
suddenly
died
so
that
he
could
legally
marry
mamie
and
remain
in
new
york
a
mad
desire
took
hold
of
him
to
see
the
polish
girl
and
he
involuntarily
took
the
way
to
her
lodging
what
is
he
going
to
say
to
her
well
he
will
beg
her
not
to
be
angry
for
his
failure
to
pay
his
debt
take
her
into
his
confidence
on
the
subject
of
his
proposed
flight
and
promise
to
send
her
every
cent
from
london
and
while
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
he
had
neither
the
money
to
take
him
across
the
atlantic
nor
the
heart
to
forsake
gitl
and
joey
and
that
mamie
would
never
let
him
leave
new
york
without
paying
her
dollars
he
started
out
on
a
run
in
the
direction
of
chrystie
street
would
she
might
offer
to
join
him
in
his
flight
she
must
have
money
enough
for
two
passage
tickets
the
rogue
would
it
be
nice
to
be
with
her
on
the
steamer
he
thought
as
he
wrathfully
brushed
apart
a
group
of
street
urchins
impeding
his
way
chapter
viii
a
housetop
idyl
jake
found
mamie
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
tenement
house
where
she
lodged
as
he
came
rushing
up
to
her
side
she
was
pensively
rehearsing
a
waltz
step
mamie
come
shomeversh
i
got
to
shpeak
to
you
a
lot
he
gasped
out
vot
de
madder
she
demanded
startled
by
his
excited
manner
this
is
not
the
place
for
speaking
he
rejoined
vehemently
in
yiddish
let
us
go
to
the
grand
street
dock
or
to
seventh
street
park
there
we
can
speak
so
that
nobody
overhears
us
i
bet
you
he
is
going
to
ask
me
to
run
away
with
him
she
prophesied
to
herself
and
in
her
feverish
impatience
to
hear
him
out
she
proposed
to
go
on
the
roof
which
the
evening
being
cool
she
knew
to
be
deserted
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
house
they
found
it
overhung
with
rows
of
linen
held
together
with
wooden
clothespins
and
trembling
to
the
fresh
autumn
breeze
overhead
fleecy
clouds
were
floating
across
a
starry
blue
sky
now
concealing
and
now
exposing
to
view
a
pallid
crescent
of
new
moon
coming
from
the
street
below
there
was
a
muffled
mysterious
hum
ever
and
anon
drowned
in
the
clatter
and
jingle
of
a
passing
horse
car
a
lurid
exceedingly
uncanny
sort
of
idyl
it
was
and
in
the
midst
of
it
there
was
something
extremely
weird
and
gruesome
in
those
stretches
of
wavering
fitfully
silvered
white
to
jake
overtaxed
mind
vaguely
suggesting
the
burial
clothes
of
the
inmates
of
a
jewish
graveyard
after
picking
and
diving
their
way
beneath
the
trembling
lines
of
underwear
pillowcases
sheets
and
what
not
they
paused
in
front
of
a
tall
chimney
pot
jake
in
a
medley
of
superstitious
terror
infatuation
and
bashfulness
was
at
a
loss
how
to
begin
and
indeed
what
to
say
feeling
that
it
would
be
easy
for
him
to
break
into
tears
he
instinctively
chose
this
as
the
only
way
out
of
his
predicament
de
jake
speak
out
she
said
with
motherly
harshness
he
now
wished
to
say
something
although
he
still
knew
not
what
but
his
sobs
once
called
into
play
were
past
his
control
she
must
give
you
the
girl
added
softly
after
a
slight
pause
her
excitement
growing
with
every
moment
ach
mamielé
he
at
length
exclaimed
resolutely
wiping
his
tears
with
his
handkerchief
my
life
has
become
so
dark
and
bitter
to
me
i
might
as
well
put
a
rope
around
my
neck
does
she
eat
you
let
her
go
to
all
lamentations
somebody
told
her
i
go
around
with
you
but
you
know
it
is
a
lie
some
one
must
have
seen
us
the
other
evening
when
we
were
standing
downstairs
you
had
better
not
come
here
then
when
you
have
some
money
you
will
send
it
to
me
she
concluded
between
genuine
sympathy
and
an
intention
to
draw
him
out
do
say
that
mamie
what
is
the
good
of
my
life
without
you
i
do
sleep
nights
since
she
came
i
began
to
understand
how
dear
you
are
to
me
i
can
not
tell
it
so
well
he
said
pointing
to
his
heart
before
she
came
you
did
for
me
she
declared
labouring
to
disguise
the
exultation
which
made
her
heart
dance
i
always
did
mamie
may
i
drop
from
this
roof
and
break
hand
and
foot
if
i
did
not
a
flood
of
wan
light
struck
mamie
full
in
her
swarthy
face
suffusing
it
with
ivory
effulgence
out
of
which
her
deep
dark
eyes
gleamed
with
a
kind
of
unearthly
lustre
jake
stood
enravished
he
took
her
by
the
hand
but
she
instantly
withdrew
it
edging
away
a
step
his
touch
somehow
restored
her
to
calm
and
even
kindled
a
certain
thirst
for
revenge
in
her
heart
it
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
jake
she
said
in
tones
of
complaisant
earnestness
now
that
i
know
you
are
a
married
man
it
is
all
gone
jake
it
is
all
gone
you
should
have
cared
for
me
when
she
was
still
there
then
you
could
have
gone
to
a
rabbi
and
sent
her
a
writ
of
divorce
it
is
too
late
now
jake
it
is
not
too
late
he
protested
tremulously
i
will
get
a
divorce
and
if
you
do
take
me
i
will
hang
myself
he
added
imploringly
on
a
burned
straw
she
retorted
with
a
cruel
chuckle
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
to
laugh
but
if
you
could
enter
my
heart
and
see
how
i
woe
is
me
i
do
see
how
you
will
stand
it
she
mocked
him
and
abruptly
assuming
a
grave
tone
she
pursued
vehemently
but
i
understand
since
you
sent
her
tickets
and
money
you
must
like
her
jake
explained
that
he
had
all
along
intended
to
send
her
rabbinical
divorce
papers
instead
of
a
passage
ticket
and
that
it
had
been
his
old
mother
who
had
pestered
him
with
her
letters
into
acting
contrary
to
his
will
mamie
resumed
with
a
dubious
smile
but
why
do
you
go
to
fanny
or
beckie
or
beilké
the
black
cat
you
used
to
care
for
them
more
than
for
me
why
should
you
just
come
to
me
jake
answered
by
characterizing
the
girls
she
had
mentioned
in
terms
rather
too
for
print
protesting
his
loathing
for
them
whereupon
she
subjected
him
to
a
rigid
as
to
his
past
conduct
toward
herself
and
her
rivals
and
although
he
managed
to
explain
matters
to
her
inward
satisfaction
owing
chiefly
to
a
predisposition
on
her
own
part
to
credit
his
assertions
on
the
subject
she
could
not
help
continuing
obdurate
and
in
a
spiteful
vindictive
mood
all
you
say
is
not
worth
a
penny
and
it
is
too
late
was
her
verdict
you
have
a
wife
and
a
child
better
go
home
and
be
a
father
to
your
her
last
words
were
uttered
with
some
approach
to
sincerity
and
she
was
mentally
beginning
to
give
herself
credit
for
magnanimity
and
pious
she
would
have
regretted
her
exhortation
however
had
she
been
aware
of
its
effect
on
her
listener
for
her
mention
of
the
boy
and
appeal
to
jake
as
a
father
aroused
in
him
a
lively
sense
of
the
wrong
he
was
doing
moreover
while
she
was
speaking
his
attention
had
been
attracted
to
a
loosened
pillowcase
ominously
fluttering
and
flapping
a
yard
or
two
off
the
figure
of
his
dead
father
attired
in
burial
linen
uprose
to
his
mind
you
don
vanted
alla
right
you
be
shorry
he
said
turning
to
go
on
she
checked
him
irritatedly
how
are
you
going
to
it
are
you
she
will
take
a
divorce
will
she
have
a
choice
then
she
will
have
to
take
it
i
wo
live
with
her
he
replied
his
passion
once
more
welling
up
in
his
soul
mamie
my
treasure
my
glory
he
exclaimed
in
tremulous
accents
say
that
you
are
my
heart
will
become
lighter
saying
which
he
strained
her
to
his
bosom
and
fell
to
raining
fervent
kisses
on
her
face
at
first
she
made
a
faint
attempt
at
freeing
herself
and
then
suddenly
clasping
him
with
mad
force
she
pressed
her
lips
to
his
in
a
fury
of
passion
the
pillowcase
flapped
aloud
ever
more
sternly
warningly
portentously
jake
cast
an
involuntary
side
glance
at
it
his
spell
of
passion
was
broken
and
supplanted
by
a
spell
of
benumbing
terror
he
had
an
impulse
to
withdraw
his
arms
from
the
girl
but
instead
he
clung
to
her
all
the
faster
as
if
for
shelter
from
the
ghostlike
thing
with
a
last
frantic
hug
mamie
relaxed
her
hold
remember
now
jake
she
then
said
in
a
queer
hollow
voice
now
it
is
all
maybe
you
are
making
fun
of
me
if
you
are
you
are
playing
with
fire
death
to
me
death
to
you
she
added
menacingly
he
wished
to
say
something
to
reassure
her
but
his
tongue
seemed
grown
fast
to
his
palate
am
i
to
blame
she
continued
with
ghastly
vehemence
sobs
ringing
in
her
voice
who
asked
you
to
come
did
i
lure
you
from
her
then
i
should
sooner
have
thrown
myself
into
the
river
than
taken
away
somebody
else
husband
you
say
yourself
that
you
would
not
live
with
her
but
now
it
is
all
gone
just
try
to
leave
me
now
and
giving
vent
to
her
tears
she
added
do
you
think
my
heart
is
no
heart
a
thrill
of
joyous
pity
shot
through
his
frame
once
again
he
caught
her
to
his
heart
and
in
a
voice
quivering
with
tenderness
he
murmured
do
be
uneasy
my
dear
my
gold
my
pearl
my
consolation
i
will
let
my
throat
be
cut
into
fire
or
water
will
i
go
for
your
sake
dot
all
right
she
returned
musingly
but
how
are
you
going
to
get
rid
of
her
you
vo
go
back
on
me
vill
you
she
asked
in
english
may
i
not
be
able
to
get
away
from
this
spot
can
it
be
that
you
still
distrust
me
swear
how
else
shall
i
swear
by
your
father
peace
upon
him
may
my
father
as
surely
have
a
bright
paradise
he
said
with
a
show
of
alacrity
his
mind
fixed
on
the
loosened
pillowcase
are
you
now
all
right
she
answered
in
a
way
and
as
if
only
half
satisfied
but
do
you
think
she
will
take
money
but
i
have
none
nobody
asks
you
if
you
have
but
would
she
take
it
if
you
had
if
i
had
i
am
sure
she
would
take
it
she
would
have
to
for
what
would
she
gain
if
she
did
not
are
you
cush
ach
but
after
all
why
did
you
not
tell
me
you
liked
me
before
she
came
she
said
testily
stamping
her
foot
again
he
exclaimed
wincing
wait
she
turned
to
go
somewhere
but
checked
herself
and
facing
about
she
exacted
an
additional
oath
of
allegiance
after
which
she
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
chimney
when
she
returned
she
held
one
of
her
arms
behind
her
you
will
not
let
yourself
be
talked
away
from
me
he
swore
not
even
if
your
father
came
to
you
from
the
other
world
if
he
came
to
you
in
a
dream
i
mean
and
told
you
to
drop
me
again
he
swore
and
you
really
do
care
for
fanny
and
again
he
swore
nor
for
beckie
the
ordeal
was
too
much
and
he
begged
her
to
desist
but
she
would
and
so
chafing
under
inexorable
he
had
to
swear
again
and
again
that
he
had
never
cared
for
any
of
joe
female
pupils
or
assistants
except
mamie
at
last
she
relented
look
piece
of
loafer
you
she
then
said
holding
out
an
open
bank
book
to
his
eyes
but
what
is
the
it
is
not
light
enough
and
you
can
not
read
you
can
eat
you
could
make
out
figures
could
you
there
are
three
hundred
and
forty
dollars
she
proceeded
pointing
to
the
balance
line
which
represented
the
savings
for
a
marriage
portion
of
five
years
hard
toil
it
should
be
three
hundred
and
but
then
for
the
dollars
you
owe
me
i
may
as
well
light
a
mourner
candle
when
she
had
started
to
produce
the
bank
book
from
her
bosom
he
had
surmised
her
intent
and
while
she
was
gone
he
was
making
guesses
as
to
the
magnitude
of
the
sum
to
her
credit
his
most
liberal
estimate
however
had
been
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
so
that
the
revelation
of
the
actual
figure
completely
overwhelmed
him
he
listened
to
her
with
a
broad
grin
and
when
she
paused
he
burst
out
mamielé
you
know
what
let
us
run
away
you
are
a
fool
she
overruled
him
as
she
tucked
the
bank
book
under
her
jacket
i
have
a
better
plan
but
tell
me
the
truth
did
you
not
guess
i
had
money
now
you
need
not
fear
to
tell
me
all
he
swore
that
he
had
not
even
dreamt
that
she
possessed
a
bank
account
how
could
he
and
was
it
not
because
he
had
suspected
the
existence
of
such
an
account
that
he
had
come
to
declare
his
love
to
her
and
not
to
fanny
or
beckie
or
the
black
cat
no
may
he
be
thunderstruck
if
it
was
what
does
she
take
him
for
on
his
part
she
is
free
to
give
the
money
away
or
throw
it
into
the
river
he
will
become
a
boss
and
take
her
penniless
for
he
can
not
live
without
her
she
is
lodged
in
his
heart
she
is
the
only
woman
he
ever
cared
for
oh
but
why
did
you
not
tell
me
all
this
long
ago
with
which
speaking
like
the
complete
mistress
of
the
situation
that
she
was
she
proceeded
to
expound
a
project
which
had
shaped
itself
in
her
lovelorn
mind
hypothetically
during
the
previous
few
days
when
she
had
been
writhing
in
despair
of
ever
having
an
occasion
to
put
it
into
practice
jake
was
to
take
refuge
with
her
married
sister
in
philadelphia
until
gitl
was
brought
to
terms
in
the
meantime
some
chum
of
his
nominated
by
mamie
and
acting
under
her
orders
would
carry
on
negotiations
the
state
divorce
as
she
had
already
taken
pains
to
ascertain
would
cost
fifty
dollars
the
rabbinical
divorce
would
take
five
or
eight
dollars
more
two
hundred
dollars
would
be
deposited
with
some
canal
street
banker
to
be
paid
to
gitl
when
the
whole
procedure
was
brought
to
a
successful
termination
if
she
can
be
got
to
accept
less
so
much
the
better
if
not
jake
and
mamie
will
get
along
anyhow
when
they
are
married
they
will
open
a
dancing
school
to
all
of
which
jake
kept
nodding
approval
once
or
twice
interrupting
her
with
a
demonstration
of
enthusiasm
as
to
the
fate
of
his
boy
mamie
deliberately
circumvented
all
reference
to
the
subject
several
times
jake
was
tempted
to
declare
his
ardent
desire
to
have
the
child
with
them
and
that
mamie
should
like
him
and
be
a
mother
to
him
for
had
she
not
herself
found
him
a
bright
and
nice
fellow
his
heart
bled
at
the
thought
of
having
to
part
with
joey
but
somehow
the
courage
failed
him
to
touch
upon
the
question
he
saw
himself
helplessly
entangled
in
something
foreboding
no
good
he
felt
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
as
the
phrase
goes
and
unnerved
by
the
whole
situation
and
completely
in
the
shop
girl
power
he
was
glad
to
be
relieved
from
all
initiative
whether
forward
or
backward
to
shut
his
eyes
as
it
were
and
leaning
upon
mamie
strong
arm
let
himself
be
led
by
her
in
whatever
direction
she
chose
do
you
know
jake
now
i
may
as
well
tell
you
the
girl
pursued
of
the
prospective
dancing
school
do
you
know
that
joe
has
been
me
to
marry
him
and
he
did
not
know
i
had
a
cent
either
you
didn
vanted
jake
asked
joyfully
i
knew
all
along
jakie
was
my
predestined
match
she
replied
drawing
his
bulky
head
to
her
lips
and
following
the
operation
by
a
sound
twirl
of
his
ear
she
added
only
he
is
a
great
lump
of
hog
jakie
is
but
a
heart
is
a
clock
it
told
me
i
would
have
you
some
day
i
could
have
got
of
suitors
may
the
two
of
us
have
as
many
thousands
of
dollars
and
too
do
you
see
what
i
am
doing
for
you
do
you
deserve
it
you
shall
see
what
a
i
if
i
do
take
away
every
from
jaw
my
name
wo
be
jake
he
squirm
he
exclaimed
with
childish
ardour
dot
all
right
but
foist
min
dot
you
don
go
back
on
me
an
hour
or
two
later
mamie
with
jake
by
her
side
stood
in
front
of
the
little
window
in
the
ferryhouse
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
buying
one
ticket
for
the
midnight
train
for
philadelphia
min
je
jake
she
said
anxiously
a
little
after
as
she
handed
him
the
ticket
this
is
as
good
as
a
marriage
certificate
do
you
understand
and
the
two
hurried
off
to
the
boat
in
a
meagre
stream
of
other
passengers
chapter
ix
the
parting
it
was
on
a
bright
frosty
morning
in
the
following
january
in
the
kitchen
of
rabbi
aaronovitz
on
the
third
floor
of
a
rickety
old
tenement
house
that
jake
and
gitl
for
the
first
time
since
his
flight
came
face
to
face
it
was
also
to
be
their
last
meeting
as
husband
and
wife
the
room
was
fairly
crowded
with
men
and
women
besides
the
principal
actors
in
the
scene
the
rabbi
the
scribe
and
the
witnesses
and
as
a
matter
of
course
kavarsky
there
was
the
rabbi
wife
their
two
children
and
an
envoy
from
mamie
charged
to
look
after
the
fortitude
of
jake
nerve
gitl
extremely
careworn
and
haggard
was
in
her
own
hair
thatched
with
a
winter
hat
of
a
brown
colour
and
in
a
jacket
of
black
beaver
the
rustic
greenhornlike
expression
was
completely
gone
from
her
face
and
manner
and
although
she
now
looked
bewildered
and
as
if
there
was
noticeable
about
her
a
suggestion
of
that
peculiar
air
of
with
which
a
few
months
life
in
america
is
sure
to
stamp
the
looks
and
bearing
of
every
immigrant
jake
flushed
and
plainly
nervous
and
fidgety
made
repeated
attempts
to
conceal
his
state
of
mind
now
by
screwing
up
a
grim
face
now
by
giving
his
enormous
head
a
haughty
posture
now
by
talking
aloud
to
his
escort
the
tedious
preliminaries
were
as
trying
to
the
rabbi
as
they
were
to
jake
and
gitl
however
the
venerable
old
man
discharged
his
duty
of
dissuading
the
young
couple
from
their
contemplated
step
as
scrupulously
as
he
dared
in
view
of
his
wife
signals
to
desist
and
not
to
risk
the
fee
gitl
prompted
by
kavarsky
responded
to
all
questions
with
an
air
of
dazed
resignation
while
jake
ever
conscious
of
his
guard
glance
gave
his
answers
with
bravado
at
last
the
scribe
a
gaunt
man
with
an
expression
of
countenance
at
once
devout
and
businesslike
set
about
his
task
whereupon
aaronovitz
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
forthwith
banished
her
two
boys
into
the
parlour
an
imposing
stillness
fell
over
the
room
little
by
little
however
it
was
broken
at
first
by
whispers
and
then
by
an
unrestrained
hum
the
rabbi
in
a
velvet
skullcap
faded
and
besprinkled
with
down
presided
with
pious
dignity
though
apparently
ill
at
ease
at
the
head
of
the
table
alternately
stroking
his
beard
and
curling
his
scanty
side
locks
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
open
book
before
him
now
and
then
stealing
a
glance
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
where
the
scribe
was
rapturously
drawing
the
square
characters
of
the
holy
tongue
gitl
carefully
looked
away
from
jake
but
he
invincibly
haunted
her
mind
rendering
her
deaf
to
kavarsky
incessant
buzz
his
presence
terrified
her
and
at
the
same
time
it
melted
her
soul
in
a
fire
torturing
yet
sweet
which
impelled
her
at
one
moment
to
throw
herself
upon
him
and
scratch
out
his
eyes
and
at
another
to
prostrate
herself
at
his
feet
and
kiss
them
in
a
flood
of
tears
jake
on
the
other
hand
eyed
gitl
quite
frequently
with
a
kind
of
malicious
curiosity
her
general
americanized
make
up
and
above
all
that
rather
fussy
hat
of
hers
nettled
him
it
seemed
to
defy
him
and
as
if
devised
for
that
express
purpose
every
time
she
and
her
adviser
caught
his
eye
a
feeling
of
devouring
hate
for
both
would
rise
in
his
heart
he
was
panting
to
see
his
son
and
while
he
was
thoroughly
alive
to
the
impossibility
of
making
a
child
the
witness
of
a
divorce
scene
between
father
and
mother
yet
in
his
fury
he
interpreted
their
failure
to
bring
joey
with
them
as
another
piece
of
malice
ready
the
scribe
at
length
called
out
getting
up
with
the
document
in
his
hand
and
turning
it
over
to
the
rabbi
the
rest
of
the
assemblage
also
rose
from
their
seats
and
clustered
round
jake
and
gitl
who
had
taken
places
on
either
side
of
the
old
man
a
beam
of
hard
cold
sunlight
filtering
in
through
a
grimy
and
falling
lurid
upon
the
rabbi
wrinkled
brow
enhanced
the
impressiveness
of
the
spectacle
a
momentary
pause
ensued
stern
weird
and
casting
a
spell
of
awe
over
most
of
the
bystanders
not
excluding
the
rabbi
kavarsky
even
gave
a
shudder
and
gulped
down
a
sob
young
woman
rabbi
aaronovitz
began
with
bashful
serenity
here
is
the
writ
of
divorce
all
ready
now
thou
mayst
still
change
thy
mind
aaronovitz
anxiously
watched
gitl
who
answered
by
a
shake
of
her
head
mind
thee
i
tell
thee
once
again
the
old
man
pursued
gently
thou
must
accept
this
divorce
with
the
same
free
will
and
readiness
with
which
thou
hast
married
thy
husband
should
there
be
the
slightest
objection
hidden
in
thy
heart
the
divorce
is
null
and
void
dost
thou
understand
say
that
you
are
whispered
kavarsky
i
am
murmured
gitl
looking
down
on
the
table
witnesses
hear
ye
what
this
young
woman
says
that
she
accepts
the
divorce
of
her
own
free
will
the
rabbi
exclaimed
solemnly
as
if
reading
the
talmud
then
i
must
also
tell
you
once
more
he
then
addressed
himself
to
jake
as
well
as
to
gitl
that
this
divorce
is
good
only
upon
condition
that
you
are
also
divorced
by
the
government
of
the
land
by
the
court
do
you
understand
so
it
stands
written
in
the
separate
paper
which
you
get
do
you
understand
what
i
say
alla
jake
said
with
ostentatious
ease
of
manner
i
have
already
told
you
that
the
of
the
is
already
have
i
he
added
even
angrily
now
came
the
culminating
act
of
the
drama
gitl
was
affectionately
urged
to
hold
out
her
hands
bringing
them
together
at
an
angle
so
as
to
form
a
receptacle
for
the
fateful
piece
of
paper
she
obeyed
mechanically
her
cheeks
turning
ghastly
pale
jake
also
pale
to
his
lips
his
brows
contracted
received
the
paper
and
obeying
directions
approached
the
woman
who
in
the
eye
of
the
law
of
moses
was
still
his
wife
and
then
repeating
word
for
word
after
the
rabbi
he
said
here
is
thy
divorce
take
thy
divorce
and
by
this
divorce
thou
art
separated
from
me
and
free
for
all
other
men
gitl
scarcely
understood
the
meaning
of
the
formula
though
each
hebrew
word
was
followed
by
its
yiddish
translation
her
arms
shook
so
that
they
had
to
be
supported
by
kavarsky
and
by
one
of
the
witnesses
at
last
jake
deposited
the
writ
and
instantly
drew
back
gitl
closed
her
hands
upon
the
paper
as
she
had
been
instructed
but
at
the
same
moment
she
gave
a
violent
tremble
and
with
a
heartrending
groan
fell
on
the
witness
in
a
fainting
swoon
in
the
ensuing
commotion
jake
slipped
out
of
the
room
presently
followed
by
mamie
ambassador
who
had
remained
behind
to
pay
the
bill
gitl
was
soon
brought
to
by
kavarsky
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
for
a
moment
or
so
she
sat
staring
about
her
when
suddenly
awakening
to
the
meaning
of
the
ordeal
she
had
just
been
through
and
finding
jake
gone
she
clapped
her
hands
and
burst
into
a
fit
of
sobbing
meanwhile
the
rabbi
had
once
again
perused
the
writ
and
having
caused
the
witnesses
to
do
likewise
he
made
two
diagonal
slits
in
the
paper
you
must
not
forget
my
daughter
he
said
to
the
young
woman
who
was
at
that
moment
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
that
you
dare
not
marry
again
before
days
counting
from
go
by
while
you
where
is
he
the
young
man
gone
he
asked
with
a
frustrated
smile
and
growing
pale
you
want
him
badly
do
you
growled
kavarsky
let
him
go
i
know
where
the
that
he
is
aaronovitz
telegraphing
to
her
husband
that
the
money
was
safe
in
her
pocket
he
remarked
sheepishly
may
wed
even
whereupon
gitl
sobs
became
still
more
violent
and
she
fell
to
nodding
her
head
and
wringing
her
hands
what
are
you
crying
about
foolish
face
that
you
are
kavarsky
fired
out
another
woman
would
thank
god
for
having
at
last
got
rid
of
the
lump
of
leavened
bread
what
say
you
rabbi

rowdy
a
sinner
of
israel

jew
know

the
name
be
it
blessed
will
send
you
your
destined
one
and
a
fine
learned
respectable
man
too
she
added
significantly
her
words
had
an
instantaneous
effect
gitl
at
once
composed
herself
and
fell
to
drying
her
eyes
quick
to
catch
kavarsky
hint
the
rabbi
wife
took
her
aside
and
asked
eagerly
why
has
she
got
a
suitor
what
is
the
you
need
not
fear
when
there
is
a
wedding
canopy
i
shall
employ

chapter
x
a
defeated
victor
when
gitl
accompanied
by
her
friend
reached
home
they
were
followed
into
the
former
apartments
by
a
batch
of
neighbours
one
of
them
with
joey
in
tow
the
moment
the
young
woman
found
herself
in
her
kitchen
she
collapsed
sinking
down
on
the
lounge
the
room
seemed
to
have
assumed
a
novel
aspect
which
brought
home
to
her
afresh
that
the
bond
between
her
and
jake
was
now
at
last
broken
forever
and
beyond
repair
the
appalling
fact
was
still
further
accentuated
in
her
consciousness
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
boy
joeyelé
joeyinké
birdie
little
kitten
with
which
she
seized
him
in
her
arms
and
kissing
him
all
over
burst
into
tears
then
shaking
with
the
child
backward
and
forward
and
intoning
her
words
as
jewish
women
do
over
a
grave
she
went
on

will
never
see

again

whereupon
yoselé
following
his
mother
example
let
loose
his
stentorian
voice
up
kavarsky
whispered
stamping
her
foot
you
want
bernstein
to
leave
you
too
do
you
no
more
is
wanted
than
that
he
should
get
wind
of
your
crying
nobody
will
tell
him
one
of
the
neighbours
put
in
resentfully
but
what
is
the
crying
ask
her
the
piece
of
hunchback
said
kavarsky
another
woman
would
dance
for
joy
and
here
she
is
whining
the
cudgel
what
is
it
you
are
snivelling
about
that
you
have
got
rid
of
an
unclean

in

heart
he

the

soon

his
heart
would
perhaps
have
swelled
with

sense
of

triumph

would
have
appeared
to
him
the
embodiment
of
his

happiness

beheld
her
bernstein

celebrating
their

bright
with

loomed
dark

impenetrable

the
best
work
that

the
design
is
clearer
the
workmanship
more
elaborate
the
style
more

the
incidents
are
most
ingenious
they
are
told
quietly
but
with
great
cunning
and
the
quixotic
sentiment
which
pervades
it
all
is
exceedingly
pleasant
a
romance
worthy
of
all
the
expectations
raised
by
the
brilliancy
of
his
former
books
and
likely
to
be
read
with
a
keen
enjoyment
and
a
healthy
exaltation
of
the
spirits
by
every
one
who
takes
it
up
a
gallant
tale
written
with
unfailing
freshness
and
spirit
daily
one
of
the
most
fascinating
romances
written
in
english
within
many
days
the
quaint
simplicity
of
its
style
is
delightful
and
the
adventures
recorded
in
these
of
count
antonio
are
as
stirring
and
ingenious
as
any
conceived
even
by
weyman
at
his
best
york
romance
of
the
real
flavor
wholly
and
entirely
romance
and
narrated
in
true
romantic
style
the
characters
drawn
with
such
masterly
handling
are
not
merely
pictures
and
portraits
but
statues
that
are
alive
and
step
boldly
forward
from

told
in
a
wonderfully
simple

direct

with
the
magic
touch
of
a
man
who
has
the
genius
of
narrative
making
the
varied
incidents
flow
naturally
and
rapidly
in
a
stream
of
sparkling
discourse

ranks
with

not
above

strong

compels
the
interest
of
the
most
novel
reader
no
adventures
were
ever
better
worth
telling
than
those
of
count
antonio
the
author
knows
full
well
how
to
make
every
pulse
thrill
and
how
to
hold
his
readers
under
the
spell
of
his
magic
a
book
to
make
women
weep
proud
tears
and
the
blood
of

to
tingle

endeavor
to
prophesy
some
of
the
triumphs
which
science
is
destined
to
win
by

year
the
book
has
been
written
with
a
purpose
and
that
a
higher
one
than
the
mere
spinning
of
a
highly
imaginative
yarn
astor
has
been
engaged
upon

book
for
over
two
years

has
brought
to
bear
upon

a
great
deal

he
has
been

fond

the
work
will
remind
the
reader
very
much
of
jules
verne
in
its
general
plan
of
using
scientific
facts
and
speculation
as
a
skeleton
on
which
to
hang
the
romantic
adventures

the
central
figures

striking
developments
