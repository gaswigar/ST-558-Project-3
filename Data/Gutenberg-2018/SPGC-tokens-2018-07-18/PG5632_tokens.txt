convincingly
that

pie

exclaimed
the
cook
shutting
up
one
eye
to
look
through
the
other
in
a
spasm
of
delight
at
an
imaginary
pie
so

phronsie

is
oh
jefferson
i
so
glad
you
like
to
have
me
make
one
she
clasped
her
hands
in
silent
rapture
and
sat
down
on
the
lowest
stair
to
think
it
over
a
bit
jefferson
looking
at
her
forgetful
that
the
under
cook
was
fuming
in
the
deserted
domains
over
his
delay
to
return
at
last
he
said
bowing
respectfully
if
you
please
miss
it
about
time
to
begin
such
a
pie
ai
done
without
a
deal
of
care
and
we
best
have
it
as
soon
as
may
be
yes
said
phronsie
getting
off
from
her
stair
and
surrendering
her
hand
to
his
big
black
palm
we
ought
to
go
right
this
very
minute
but
i
must
get
my
apron
on
she
stopped
and
looked
down
at
her
red
dress
oh
you
can
take
one
of
my
aprons
said
the
cook
they
as
fine
and
big
and
white
and
i
just
put
you
in
one
of
and
tie
you
up
as
snug
you
come
out
as
clean
and
sweet
when
we
through
as
you
are
now
miss
tie
me
up
laughed
phronsie
in
glee
oh
how
nice
jefferson
do
you
know
i
love
you
very
much
jefferson
you
so
very
good
to
me
the
big
fellow
drew
a
long
breath
no
miss
i
big
and
black
and
just
fit
to
stay
downstairs
he
managed
to
say
but
i
love
you
better
because
you
are
black
jefferson
insisted
phronsie
a
great
deal
better
you
are
not
like
everybody
else
but
you
are
just
yourself
clinging
to
his
hand
well
miss
i
ai
just
fit
for
a
lily
to
touch
and
that
the
truth
looking
down
at
his
palm
that
the
small
white
hand
grasped
closely
it
clean
miss
he
added
with
pardonable
pride
but
awful
black
i
like
it
better
black
jefferson
said
phronsie
again
really
and
truly
i
do
because
then
it
your
very
very
own
in
a
tone
that
thrilled
him
much
as
if
a
queen
had
knighted
him
on
the
spot
this
important
declaration
over
the
two
set
forth
on
their
way
toward
the
kitchen
phronsie
clinging
to
his
hand
and
chatting
merrily
over
the
particular
pie
in
prospect
with
varied
remarks
on
pies
in
general
that
by
and
by
would
be
ventured
upon
if
this
present
one
were
a
success
and
very
soon
tied
up
in
one
of
the
cook
whitest
aprons
she
was
seated
with
due
solemnity
at
the
end
of
the
baking
table
the
proper
utensils
and
materials
in
delightful
confusion
before
her
and
the
lower
order
of
kitchen
satellites
revolving
around
her
and
jefferson
the
lesser
sphere
now
all
go
back
to
your
work
said
that
functionary
when
he
considered
the
staring
and
muttered
admiration
had
been
indulged
in
long
enough
and
leave
us
i
want
you
said
his
assistant
touching
his
elbow
clear
out
said
jefferson
angrily
his
face
turned
quite
from
phronsie
but
she
caught
the
tone
and
immediately
laid
down
the
bit
of
dough
she
was
moulding
do
go
she
begged
and
come
back
quickly
smiling
up
into
his
face
see
i
going
to
pat
and
pat
and
pat
oh
ever
so
much
before
you
come
back
so
jefferson
followed
the
under
cook
the
scullery
boy
went
back
to
cleaning
the
knives
susan
the
parlor
maid
who
was
going
through
the
kitchen
with
her
dustpan
and
broom
hurried
off
with
a
backward
glance
or
two
and
phronsie
was
left
quite
alone
to
hum
her
way
along
in
her
blissful
culinary
attempt
bless
me
exclaimed
a
voice
close
to
her
small
ear
as
she
was
attempting
for
the
fifth
time
to
roll
out
the
paste
quite
as
thin
as
she
had
seen
jefferson
do
what
is
this
bless
my
soul
it
phronsie
phronsie
set
down
the
heavy
and
turned
in
her
chair
with
a
gleeful
laugh
dear
dear
grandpapa
she
cried
clasping
her
floury
hands
oh
so
glad

to
see

a
pie

by

for

called

exclaimed
phronsie
in
dire
distress
i
sent

jefferson
hurrying
up
i
only
stepped
off
a
bit
to
the
cellar
bassett

down
a
lot
of
turnips
they
and
all

said
king
cutting
him
short
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
if

phronsie

you
off
it
all
right
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
elaborate
explanations
little
miss

alone
but
a
few
minutes
said
jefferson
in
a
worried
way
and
see
said
phronsie
turning
back
to
her
efforts
while
one
hand
grasped
the
old
gentleman
palm
i
almost
got
it
to
look
like
jefferson
almost
have
i
she
asked
regarding
it
anxiously
it
will
be
the
most
beautiful
pie
cried
king
a
hearty
enthusiasm
succeeding
his
irritability
that
ever
was
baked
i
wish
you
make
me
one
sometime
phronsie
do
you
she
cried
in
a
tremor
of
delight
and
will

really
have
it
on
the
table
and
cut
it
with
aunt
whitney
big
silver
knife
that
i
will
declared
king
solemnly
then
some
day
i
come
down
here

jefferson
cried
phronsie
in
a
transport
and
bake
one
for
my
dear
grandpapa
that
is
if
this
one
is
good
oh
you
do
suppose
it
will
be
good

you
appealingly
at
him

said
jefferson
stoutly
and
seizing
the
with
extreme
determination
you
want
a
bit
more
butter
worked
in
here
a
dab
with
skillful
fingers
and
a
little
manipulation
with
the
flour
a
roll
now
and
then
most
deftly
and
the
paste
was
laid
out
before
phronsie
now
miss
you
can
put
it
in
the
dish
but
is
is
my
pie
said
phronsie
and
big
girl
as
she
felt
herself
to
be
she
sat
back
in
her
chair
her
lower
lip
quivering
not
your
pie
repeated
the
cook
bringing
himself
up
straight
to
gaze
at
her
no
said
phronsie
shaking
her
yellow
head
gravely
it
is
my
pie
now
jefferson
you
put
in
the
things
and
rolled
it
leave
your
fingers
off
from
it
ca

cried
king
sharply
goodness
this
pie
is
to
have
a
professional
touch
about
it
get
some
more
flour
and
stuff
whatever
it
is
you

a
pie
of
and
let
her
begin
again
there
i
sit
down
and
watch
you
then
there
be
some
chance
of
having
things
straight
so
he
drew
up
a
chair
to
the
side
of
the
table
first
calling
off
pete
the
scullery
boy
from
his
knives
to
come
and
wipe
it
off
for
him
and
tucker
who
was
in
kitchen
dialect
tucker
to
see
that
the
boy
did
his
work
well
lor
bless
you
sir
said
tucker
bestowing
a
final
polish
with
her
apron
was
like
satin
before
sir
not
a
wisp
of
dust
i
do
want
any
observations
from
you
said
the
old
gentleman
depositing
himself
in
the
chair
there
you
can
go
back
to
your
work
tucker
and
you
too
pete
now
i
see
that
this
pie
is
to
your
liking
phronsie
but
phronsie
still
sat
back
in
her
chair
thoughtfully
surveying
jefferson
grandpapa
she
said
at
last
slowly
i
think
i
rather
have
the
first
pie
i
really
would
grandpapa
may
i
she
brought
her
yellow
head
forward
by
a
sudden
movement
and
looked
deep
into
his
keen
eyes
bless
my
soul
rather
have
the
first
pie
repeated
the
old
gentleman
in
astonishment
why
i
thought
you
wanted
to
make
one
all
yourself
i
think
i
rather
do
part
of
it
said
phronsie
with
great
deliberateness
then
polly
like
it
and
eat
it
and
i
do
yours
grandpapa
dear
just
as
jefferson
fixed
mine
all
alone
please
let
me
she
held
him
fast
with
her
eyes
and
waited
for
his
answer
so
you
shall
cried
king
in
great
satisfaction
make
mine
all
alone
this
one
would
better
go
as
it
is
put
away
the
flour
and
things
jefferson
miss
phronsie
does
want
them
phronsie
gave
a
relieved
little
sigh
and
jefferson
if
you
showed
me
how
i
could
ever
in
all
this
world
make
grandpapa
now
give
me
the
little
plate
do
here
is
miss
said
the
cook
all
his
tremor
over
the
blunder
he
had
made
disappearing
since
after
all
things
were
quite
satisfactory
and
the
little
plate
forthcoming
phronsie
tucked
away
the
paste
lovingly
in
its
depths
and
began
the
important
work
of
concocting
the
mixture
with
which
the
pie
was
to
be
filled
king
sitting
by
with
the
gravity
of
a
statue
even
to
the
deliberate
placing
of
each
plum
where
phronsie
called
a
voice
above
in
one
of
the
upper
halls
oh
she
coming
polly
is
cried
phronsie
deserting
a
plum
thrust
in
endwise
in
the
middle
of
the
pie
to
throw
her
little
sticky
fingers
around
jefferson
neck
oh
do
take
off
my
apron
and
let
me
go
she
see
my
pie
stop
cried
king
getting
up
somewhat
stiffly
to
his
feet
take
off
the
apron
myself
there
phronsie
there
you
are
whew
how
hot
you
keep
your
kitchen
jefferson
and
he
wiped
his
face
now
we
run
said
phronsie
softly
and
not
make
a
bit
of
noise
grandpapa
dear
and
jefferson
please
put
on
my
top
to
the
pie
and
do
let
it
burn
and
i
come
down
very
very
soon
again
and
bake
one
all
alone
by
myself
for
grandpapa
the
old
gentleman
kept
up
very
well
with
the
soft
patter
of
her
feet
till
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
staircase
there
there
child
he
said
there
not
the
least
need
of
hurry
now
but
she
will
come
down
said
phronsie
in
gentle
haste
pulling
at
his
hand
then
if
she
should
see
it
grandpapa
to
be
sure
that
would
indeed
be
dreadful
said
king
getting
over
the
stairs
very
creditably
there
here
we
are
now
whew
terribly
warm
in
this
house
but
there
was
no
danger
from
polly
she
was
at
this
very
instant
not
being
able
to
find
phronsie
hurrying
off
toward
the
library
in
search
of
whitney
we
want
to
do
the
very
loveliest
thing
she
cried
rushing
in
her
cheeks
aflame
oh
pray
excuse
me
she
stopped
short
blushing
scarlet
do
feel
badly
polly
dear
said
whitney
over
in
the
dim
light
where
the
divan
was
drawn
up
in
the
east
window
and
she
held
out
her
hand
and
smiled
the
other
lady
whose
was
thus
summarily
disturbed
was
elderly
and
very
tall
and
angular
she
put
up
her
eyeglass
at
the
intrusion
and
murmured
ah
this
is
polly
pepper
said
whitney
as
polly
feeling
unusually
awkward
and
shy
stumbled
across
the
library
to
get
within
the
kind
arms
awaiting
her
one
of
the
children
that
your
kindness
received
in
this
house
said
the
tall
lady
making
good
use
of
the
eyeglass
the
color
mounted
steadily
on
polly
already
rosy
cheek
at
the
scrutiny
now
going
on
with
the
greatest
freedom
one
of
the
dear
children
who
make
this
house
a
sunny
place
for
us
all
said
whitney
distinctly
ah
i
see
you
are
extremely
good
to
put
it
in
that
way
a
low
laugh
followed
this
speech
its
sound
irritated
the
young
girl
ear
unspeakably
and
the
brown
eyes
flashed
and
though
there
was
really
no
occasion
to
feel
what
was
not
addressed
to
her
polly
was
quite
sure
she
utterly
disliked
the
lady
before
her
my
dear
chatterton
said
whitney
in
the
gentlest
of
accents
you
do
not
comprehend
it
is
not
possible
for
you
to
understand
how
very
happy
we
all
are
here
the
house
is
quite
another
place
i
assure
you
from
the
abode
you
saw
last
before
you
went
abroad
chatterton
gave
another
low
unpleasant
laugh
and
this
time
shrugged
her
shoulders
polly
dear
said
whitney
with
a
smile
say
to
chatterton
and
then
run
away
i
will
hear
your
wonderful
plan
by
and
by
i
shall
be
glad
to
child
she
was
guilty
of
whispering
in
the
small
ear
chatterton
said
polly
slowly
the
brown
eyes
looking
steadily
into
the
traveled
and
somewhat
seamed
countenance
before
her
and
polly
found
herself
once
more
across
the
floor
and
safely
out
in
the
hall
the
door
closed
between
them
who
is
she
she
cried
in
an
indignant
spasm
to
jasper
who
ran
up
and
she
lifted
her
eyes
brimming
over
with
something
quite
new
to
him
he
stopped
aghast
who
he
cried
oh
polly
what
has
happened
chatterton
and
she
looked
at
me
oh
i
ca
tell
you
how
she
looked
as
if
i
were
a
bug
or
a
hateful
worm
beneath
her
cried
polly
quite
as
much
aghast
at
herself
it
makes
me
feel
horridly
jasper
you
ca
think
oh
that
old
he
stopped
pulling
himself
up
with
quite
an
effort
has
she
come
back
what
brought
her
pray
tell
so
soon
i
do
know
i
am
sure
said
polly
laughing
at
his
face
i
was
only
in
the
room
a
moment
i
think
but
it
seemed
an
age
with
that
eyeglass
and
that
hateful
little
laugh
oh
she
always
sticks
up
that
thing
in
her
eye
said
jasper
coolly
and
she
everlastingly
ventilating
that
laugh
on
everybody
she
thinks
it
and
elegant
but
it
makes
people
want
to
kill
her
for
it
he
looked
and
spoke
annoyed
to
think
you
fell
into
her
clutches
he
added
well
who
is
she
cried
polly
smoothing
down
her
ruffled
feathers
when
she
saw
the
effect
of
her
news
on
him
i
should
dearly
love
to
know
cousin
algernon
wife
said
jasper
briefly
and
who
is
he
cried
polly
again
experiencing
a
shock
that
this
dreadful
person
was
a
relative
to
whom
due
respect
must
be
shown
oh
a
cousin
of
father
said
jasper
he
was
nice
but
he
dead
oh
said
polly
she
been
abroad
for
a
good
years
and
why
she
stay
there
when
everybody
supposed
she
was
going
to
astonishes
me
said
jasper
after
a
moment
well
it
will
not
be
for
long
i
presume
that
we
shall
have
the
honor
she
be
easily
tired
of
america
and
take
herself
off
again
she
does
stay
in
this
house
does
she
jasper
cried
polly
in
a
tone
of
horror
no
that
is
unless
she
chooses
to
then
we
ca
turn
her
off
a
relative
you
know
has
she
any
home
asked
polly
or
any
children
home
yes
an
estate
down
in
bedford
county
lodge
but
all
shut
up
and
in
the
hands
of
agents
who
have
been
trying
for
the
years
she
was
abroad
to
sell
it
for
her
she
may
have
come
back
to
settle
down
there
again
there
no
telling
what
she
will
do
in
the
meantime
i
fancy
she
make
her
headquarters
here
he
said
gloomily
oh
jasper
exclaimed
polly
seizing
his
arm
feeling
that
here
was
need
of
comfort
indeed
how
very
dreadful
do
you
suppose
something
will
happen
to
take
her
away
i
do
see
what
can
said
jasper
prolonging
the
gloom
to
feel
the
comfort
it
brought
you
see
she
has
nobody
who
wants
her
to
step
in
and
relieve
us
she
has
two
nephews
but
oh
you
ought
to
see
them
fight
fight
repeated
polly
aghast
yes
you
ca
dignify
their
skirmishes
by
any
other
name
said
jasper
in
disgust
so
you
see
our
chances
for
keeping
her
as
long
as
she
condescends
to
stay
are
really
very
good
polly
clung
to
his
arm
in
speechless
dismay
meanwhile
conversation
fast
and
brisk
was
going
on
between
the
two
shut
up
in
the
library
it
is
greatly
to
your
discredit
marian
said
chatterton
in
a
high
cold
voice
that
you
did
stop
all
this
nonsense
on
your
father
part
before
the
thing
got
to
such
a
pass
as
to
install
them
in
this
house
on
the
contrary
said
whitney
with
a
little
laugh
i
did
everything
i
could
to
further
the
plan
that
father
wisely
made
wisely
cried
chatterton
in
scorn
oh
you
silly
child
you
see
what
it
will
all
tend
to
i
see
that
it
has
made
us
all
very
happy
for
five
years
said
whitney
preserving
her
composure
so
i
presume
the
future
hold
much
to
dread
on
that
score
the
future
is
all
you
have
to
dread
declared
chatterton
harshly
the
present
may
be
well
enough
though
i
should
think
existence
with
that
low
underbred
family
here
would
be
a
you
may
pause
just
where
you
are
chatterton
said
marian
still
with
the
gentlest
of
accents
but
with
a
determination
that
made
the
other
look
down
at
her
in
astonishment
not
another
word
shall
you
utter
in
that
strain
nor
will
i
listen
to
it
and
with
fine
temper
undisturbed
in
her
blue
eyes
she
regarded
her
relative
dear
me
marian
i
begin
to
notice
your
age
more
now
you
fly
into
such
rages
they
wear
on
one
fearfully
and
especially
for
a
stranger
too
and
against
your
own
people
how
can
you
chatterton
drew
out
a
vinaigrette
then
a
fan
from
a
silken
bag
with
clasps
that
she
was
always
glad
to
reflect
were
heirlooms
trying
i
must
confess
she
declared
alternately
applying
the
invigorating
salts
and
waving
the
combination
of
gauze
and
sandalwood
to
come
home
to
such
a
reception
but
and
a
heavy
sigh
i
must
bear
it
you
ought
to
see
father
cried
whitney
rising
i
must
go
at
once
and
tell
him
of
your
arrival
oh
i
do
know
that
i
care
about
seeing
cousin
horatio
yet
said
chatterton
carelessly
he
will
probably
fall
into
one
of
his
rages
and
my
nerves
have
been
upset
quite
enough
by
you
i
think
go
directly
to
my
apartments
she
rose
also
father
must
at
once
be
informed
of
your
arrival
repeated
marian
quietly
i
send
him
in
to
see
you
and
i
shall
go
to
my
apartments
declared
chatterton
determinedly
exclaimed
king
voice
and
in
he
came
with
phronsie
fresh
from
the
kitchen
clinging
to
his
hand
ii
cousin
eunice
chatterton
phronsie
dropped
one
small
hand
by
her
side
and
stood
quite
still
regarding
the
visitor
oh
my
goodness
me
ejaculated
chatterton
startled
out
of
her
elegance
and
not
pausing
to
adjust
the
glass
but
using
her
two
good
eyes
to
the
best
advantage
so
you
are
back
again
exclaimed
king
by
way
of
welcome
well
and
if
i
may
ask
what
brought
you
now
eunice
chatterton
gathered
herself
up
and
smiled
in
a
superior
way
never
mind
my
reasons
cousin
horatio
what
a
fine
child
you
have
there
now
the
glass
came
into
play
pray
tell
me
all
about
her
you
have
well
said
observed
king
seating
himself
with
the
utmost
deliberateness
and
drawing
phronsie
to
her
accustomed
place
on
his
knee
where
she
nestled
regardless
of
his
immaculate
linen
and
fine
waistcoat
phronsie
pepper
is
indeed
a
fine
child
a
very
fine
child
madam
oh
my
and
oh
my
cried
chatterton
holding
up
her
hands
to
think
that
you
can
so
demean
yourself
why
she
actually
mussing
your
with
her
dirty
little
hands
phronsie
pepper
hands
are
never
dirty
madam
said
the
old
gentleman
gravely
sit
still
child
as
phronsie
in
a
state
of
alarm
struggled
to
slip
down
from
his
lap
thrusting
the
two
members
thus
referred
to
well
out
before
her
chatterton
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
to
think
i
have
come
to
see
horatio
king
in
such
a
state
jasper
horatio
king
she
repeated
scornfully
i
heard
about
it
through
the
bascombs
letters
but
i
would
believe
it
till
i
used
my
eyes
it
positively
dreadful
king
put
back
his
head
and
laughed
also
so
heartily
that
phronsie
ceased
to
struggle
and
turned
to
regard
him
in
silent
astonishment
and
whitney
charmed
that
the
rage
usually
produced
by
conversation
with
cousin
algernon
wife
was
not
forthcoming
began
to
laugh
too
so
that
the
amusement
of
the
tall
lady
was
quenched
in
the
general
hilarity
what
you
can
find
in
my
words
to
cause
such
an
unseemly
outburst
i
can
not
see
she
cried
in
a
passion
i
under
the
impression
that
you
led
off
the
amusement
yourself
said
king
wiping
his
eyes
phronsie
it
all
very
funny
it
looking
down
into
the
little
wondering
face
is
it
really
funny
asked
phronsie
does
the
lady
like
it
not
particularly
i
suspect
said
king
carelessly
and
that
you
can
talk
with
that
chit
ignoring
me
your
cousin
wife
is
insufferable
chatterton
now
arose
speedily
from
the
divan
and
shook
out
a
flounce
or
two
with
great
venom
i
had
intended
to
make
you
a
visit
now
it
is
quite
impossible
as
you
like
said
the
old
gentleman
also
rising
and
placing
phronsie
on
her
feet
observing
ostentatious
care
to
keep
her
hand
my
house
is
open
to
you
eunice
with
a
wave
of
his
disengaged
hand
in
hospitality
but
of
course
you
must
suit
yourself
it
rather
hard
upon
a
person
of
sensibility
to
come
home
after
a
six
years
absence
said
cousin
eunice
with
a
pathetic
sniff
and
once
more
seeking
her
vinaigrette
in
the
depths
of
the
silken
bag
to
meet
only
coldness
and
derision
in
fact
it
is
very
hard
no
doubt
no
doubt
said
the
old
gentleman
hastily
i
can
imagine
such
a
case
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
now
if
you
are
going
to
stay
eunice
say
so
at
once
and
proceed
to
your
room
if
not
why
you
must
go
and
understand
it
is
no
one
fault
but
your
own
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
long
and
hard
into
the
thin
pale
face
before
him
phronsie
pulled
at
his
hand
i
want
to
ask
the
lady
to
stay
grandpapa
dear
she
does
need
urging
said
old
king
quite
distinctly
and
not
moving
a
muscle
but
grandpapa
dear
she
is
glad
about
something
no
more
am
i
grandpapa
cried
phronsie
moving
off
a
bit
though
not
deserting
his
hand
and
standing
on
her
tiptoes
i
want
her
to
stay
to
see
me
perhaps
she
has
any
little
girls
to
see
you
cried
king
irately
say
no
more
child
say
no
more
she
been
abusing
you
right
and
left
like
a
what
is
a
asked
phronsie
getting
down
from
her
tiptoes
oh
a
scoundrel
who
puts
his
hands
into
pockets
picks
out
what
does
belong
to
him
in
fact
phronsie
stood
quite
still
and
shook
her
head
gravely
at
the
tall
figure
that
was
not
nice
she
said
soberly
now
do
you
want
her
to
stay
cried
the
old
gentleman
insufferable
repeated
chatterton
between
her
teeth
to
mix
me
up
with
that
chit
yes
i
do
said
phronsie
decidedly
i
do
grandpapa
now
i
know
she
has
any
little
girls
if
she
had
little
girls
she
would
say
such
very
unnice
things
i
want
the
poor
lady
to
stay
with
me
chatterton
turned
and
went
abruptly
off
to
the
door
hesitated
and
looked
back
i
see
your
household
is
in
a
very
chaotic
state
cousin
horatio
still
i
will
remain
a
few
days
with
extreme
condescension
on
condition
that
these
peppers
are
not
thrust
upon
my
attention
i
make
no
conditions
said
the
old
gentleman
coolly
if
you
stay
you
must
accept
my
household
as
you
find
it
come
marian
said
chatterton
holding
out
her
hand
to
whitney
you
may
help
me
to
my
apartments
if
you
like
i
am
quite
unstrung
by
all
this
and
she
swept
out
without
a
backward
glance
has
she
gone
cried
jasper
hurrying
in
with
polly
running
after
it
is
it
father
as
he
saw
the
old
gentleman
face
yes
said
king
grimly
it
is
indeed
jasper
well
now
then
you
a
piece
of
work
on
your
hands
about
the
biggest
you
ever
did
yet
polly
pepper
cried
jasper
to
make
things
comfortable
in
this
house
i
shall
be
just
as
cross
as
can
be
imagined
to
begin
with
you
cross
cried
polly
cross
as
a
bear
marian
will
fight
against
the
prevailing
ill
wind
but
it
will
finally
blow
her
down
to
a
state
of
depression
where
her
best
friend
would
recognize
her
and
you
do
mention
me
my
boy
said
king
dryly
jasper
looked
into
his
father
eyes
and
they
both
laughed
and
if
you
polly
pepper
do
keep
things
bright
why
we
shall
all
go
to
the
dogs
said
the
old
gentleman
sobering
down
so
mind
you
do
and
we
try
to
bear
cousin
algernon
relict
i
will
said
polly
stoutly
though
relict
sounded
very
dreadful
to
begin
with
give
us
your
hand
then
said
jasper
father
putting
out
his
palm
there
releasing
it
now
i
much
more
comfortable
about
matters
and
give
me
your
hand
polly
cried
jasper
his
own
brown
hand
flying
to
meet
hers
there
and
now
i
comfortable
too
so
it
a
compact
and
a
sure
one
and
i
want
to
give
my
hand
cried
phronsie
very
much
aggrieved
here
jasper
bless
my
soul
so
you
must
cried
old
king
to
think
we
ask
you
first
there
and
there
and
phronsie
darling
cried
polly
in
a
rapture
you
must
promise
with
me
after
you
have
with
the
others
i
could
ever
get
along
in
all
this
world
without
that
so
the
ceremony
of
sealing
the
compact
having
been
observed
with
great
gravity
phronsie
drew
a
long
breath
and
now
felt
that
the
poor
lady
might
come
down
at
any
time
to
find
all
things
prepared
for
her
now
tell
our
plan
cried
jasper
to
polly
and
put
this
disagreeable
business
out
of
our
heads
it
a
fine
one
he
added
to
his
father
of
course
it
is
cried
the
old
gentleman
well
you
know
joel
and
davie
and
van
and
percy
are
coming
home
from
school
next
week
for
the
christmas
holidays
began
polly
trying
to
still
the
wild
beating
of
her
heart
bless
me
so
they
are
said
king
how
time
flies
to
be
sure
well
go
on
polly
and
we
ought
to
do
something
to
celebrate
said
polly
at
least
do
you
think
so
she
asked
anxiously
looking
up
in
his
face
to
be
sure
i
do
cried
the
old
gentleman
heartily
well
what
would
you
do
polly
child
to
show
the
youngsters
we
proud
of
them
and
glad
to
get
them
back
hey

want
to
get
up
a
little
play
said
polly
jasper
and
i
and
act
it
and
have
music

play
on
the
piano
the
boys
will
be
so
delighted
to
see
how
she
has
improved
and
jasper
will
play
too
cried
polly
eagerly
oh
jasper
will
you
play
that
concerto
the
one
you
played
when
mary
gibbs
was
here
at
tea
last
week
do
jasper
do
that
nearly
floored
me
said
jasper
no
you
said
it
was
mary
watching
you
like
a
lynx
you
know
you
did
said
polly
laughing
merrily
never
mind
said
the
old
gentleman
what
next
polly
the
play
is
all
right
i
should
think
it
was
cried
jasper
it
the
three
dragons
and
the
princess
clotilde
oh
my
goodness
exclaimed
king
what
a
play
for
christmas
eve
well
you
say
it
a
splendid
hit
cried
jasper
when
you
see
it
from
the
private
box
we
are
going
to
give
you
so
you
are
intending
to
honor
me
are
you
cried
his
father
vastly
pleased
to
find
himself
as
ever
the
central
figure
in
their
plans
well
well
i
dare
say
it
will
all
be
as
fine
as
can
be
to
welcome
these
young
scapegraces
home
what
next
polly
it
must
be
kept
a
perfect
surprise
cried
polly
clasping
her
hands
while
the
color
flew
over
her
face
no
one
must
even
whisper
it
to
each
other
the
day
before
christmas
when
the
boys
get
here
for
joel
is
so
very
dreadful
whenever
there
is
a
secret
his
capacity
certainly
is
good
said
king
dryly
we
will
all
be
very
careful
and
phronsie
is
to
be
princess
clotilde
cried
jasper
seizing
her
suddenly
to
prance
around
the
room
just
like
old
times
oh
jasper
i
eight
years
old
she
cried
struggling
to
free
herself
nonsense
what
of
it
you
are
the
baby
of
this
household
but
he
set
her
on
her
feet
nevertheless
one
hand
still
patting
the
soft
yellow
waves
over
her
brow
go
on
polly
do
and
lay
the
whole
magnificence
before
father
he
will
be
quite
overcome
that
would
be
disastrous
said
king
better
save
your
effects
till
the
grand
affair
comes
off
jasper
is
to
be
one
of
the
dragons
announced
polly
quite
in
her
element
that
is
the
head
dragon
ben
is
to
be
another
and
we
have
quite
decided
whether
to
ask
archy
hurd
or
clare
to
take
the
third
one
clare
has
the
most
in
him
said
jasper
critically
then
i
think
we
decide
now
to
ask
him
said
polly
do
you
jasper
a
dragon
without
in
him
would
be
most
undesirable
i
should
fancy
well
what
next
do
you
propose
to
do
polly
asked
king
now
that
we
know
that
you
will
allow
us
to
have
it
cried
polly
in
a
rapture
why
we
can
think
up
splendid
things
we
only
the
play
written
so
far
sir
polly
wrote
the
most
said
jasper
oh
no
jasper
i
only
put
in
the
bits
said
polly
he
planned
it
every
single
bit
jasper
did
well
she
thought
up
the
dragons
and
the
cave
and
oh
that
was
easy
enough
said
polly
guilty
of
interrupting
because
you
see
something
has
to
carry
off
the
princess
clotilde
oh
now
you
are
not
going
to
frighten
my
little
girl
cried
king
i
protest
against
the
whole
thing
if
you
do
and
he
put
out
his
hand
come
phronsie
when
as
of
old
she
hurried
to
his
side
obediently
oh
we
are
going
to
show
her
the
boys
and
how
we
dress
them
up
just
like
dragons
cried
polly
and
while
they
are
prancing
around
and
slashing
their
tails
at
rehearsal
i
going
to
keep
saying
nothing
but
jasper
and
ben
and
clare
you
know
phronsie
till
i
get
her
accustomed
to
them
you
wo
be
frightened
will
you
pet
at
those
dear
sweet
old
dragons
she
ended
and
getting
on
her
knees
she
looked
imploringly
into
phronsie
brown
eyes
n
no
said
phronsie
slowly
not
if
they
are
really
jasper
and
ben

give
you
a
ride
and
show
you
a
cave
oh
and
perfect
quantities
of
things
you
ca
think
how
many
phronsie
clapped
her
hands
and
laughed
aloud
in
glee
oh
i
do
care
if
they
are
true
dragons
polly
i
do
she
cried
dreadfully
excited
make
real
big
live
ones
do
do
make
them
big
and
let
me
ride
on
their
backs
these
will
be
just
as
real

polly
comfortingly
that
is
they
act
real
only
there
will
be
boys
inside
of
them
oh
have
them
nice
dear
do
you
fear
but
i
really
rather
have
true
ones
sighed
phronsie
iii
the
rehearsal
now
phronsie
said
polly
on
her
knees
before
the
princess
who
was
slowly
evolving
into
a
thing
of
beauty
do
hold
still
just
a
minute
dear
there
as
she
thrust
in
another
pin
then
turned
her
head
critically
to
view
her
work
i
do
hope
that
is
right
phronsie
sighed
may
i
just
stretch
a
wee
little
bit
polly
she
asked
timidly
before
you
pin
it
up
just
a
very
little
bit
to
be
sure
you
may
said
polly
looking
into
the
flushed
little
face
i
tell
you
you
may
walk
over
to
the
window
and
back
once
rest
you
and
give
me
a
chance
to
see
what
is
the
matter
with
that
back
drapery
so
phronsie
well
pleased
gathered
up
the
embyro
robe
of
the
princess
and
moved
off
a
bewildering
tangle
of
silver
spangles
and
floating
lace
drawn
over
the
skirt
of
one
of
whitney
white
satin
gowns
there
ought
to
be
a
dash
of
royal
purple
somewhere
said
polly
sitting
on
the
floor
to
see
her
go
and
resting
her
tired
hands
on
her
knees
now
where
shall
i
get
it
and
where
shall
i
put
it
when
i
do
have
it
she
wrinkled
up
her
eyebrows
a
moment
lost
in
thought
over
the
momentous
problem
oh
i
know
and
she
sprang
up
exultingly
phronsie
wo
this
be
perfectly
lovely
we
can
take
that
piece
of
tissue
paper
auntie
gave
you
and
i
can
cut
out
little
knots
and
sashes
it
is
so
soft
that
in
the
gaslight
they
will
look
like
silk
how
fine
ca
i
be
a
princess
unless
you
sew
up
that
purple
paper
asked
phronsie
pausing
suddenly
to
look
over
her
shoulder
in
dismay
at
polly
why
yes
you
can
be
of
course
said
polly
but
you
ca
be
as
good
a
one
as
if
you
had
a
dash
of
royal
purple
about
you
what
a
bit
of
tissue
paper
to
the
glory
of
being
a
princess
she
cried
with
sparkling
eyes
dear
me
i
wish
i
could
be
one
well
you
may
have
it
polly
said
phronsie
with
a
sigh
and
then
afterwards
i
rip
it
all
off
and
smooth
it
out
and
it
will
be
almost
as
good
as
new
i
think
there
wo
be
much
left
of
it
when
the
play
is
over
cried
polly
with
a
laugh
why
the
dragons
are
going
to
carry
you
off
to
their
cave
you
know
and
you
are
to
be
rescued
by
the
knight
just
think
phronsie
you
ca
expect
to
have
such
perfectly
delightful
times
and
come
out
with
a
quantity
of
tissue
paper
all
safe
something
has
to
be
scarified
to
royalty
child
phronsie
sighed
again
but
as
polly
approved
of
royalty
so
highly
she
immediately
lent
herself
to
the
anticipations
of
the
pleasure
before
her
smothering
all
lesser
considerations
when
you
get
your
little
silver
cap
on
with
one
of
auntie
diamond
rings
sewed
in
it
why
you
be
too
magnificent
for
anything
said
polly
now
pulling
and
patting
with
fresh
enthusiasm
since
the
purple
dash
was
forthcoming
princesses
do
wear
silver
caps
with
diamond
rings
sewed
in
them
observed
phronsie
wisely
of
course
not
they
have
diamonds
by
the
bushel
and
do
need
to
sew
rings
in
their
caps
to
make
them
sparkle
said
polly
plaiting
and
pinning
rapidly
but
in
dressing
up
for
a
play
we
have
to
take
a
poetic
license
there
turn
just
one
bit
to
the
right
phronsie
dear
what
poetic
license
demanded
phronsie
wrenching
her
imagination
off
from
the
bushel
of
diamonds
to
seize
practical
information
oh
when
a
man
writes
verses
and
says
things
that
are
so
said
polly
her
mind
on
the
many
details
before
her
but
he
ought
not
to
cried
phronsie
with
wide
eyes
say
things
that
are
not
so
i
thought
poets
were
always
very
good
polly
oh
well
people
let
him
said
polly
carelessly
because
he
puts
it
into
poetry
it
would
never
do
in
prose
that
would
be
quite
shocking
oh
said
phronsie
finding
the
conversation
some
alleviation
to
the
process
now
this
left
side
said
polly
twisting
her
head
to
obtain
a
good
view
of
the
point
in
question
is
just
right
i
could
do
it
any
better
if
i
were
to
try
a
thousand
times
why
wo
this
other
one
behave
and
fall
into
a
pretty
curve
i
wonder
phronsie
yawned
softly
as
the
brown
eyes
were
safely
behind
her
i
shall
gather
it
up
anyway
so
and
polly
crushed
the
refractory
folds
recklessly
in
one
hand
that
the
way
mary
gibbs
hat
trimmings
look
and
i
sure
they
a
complete
success
oh
lovely
cried
polly
at
the
effect
now
that
the
treatment
the
whole
drapery
needs
she
added
in
the
tone
of
an
art
connoisseur
oh
a
rushing
noise
announced
the
approach
of
two
or
three
boys
together
with
the
barking
of
prince
as
they
all
ran
down
the
wide
hall
o
dear
dear
exclaimed
polly
hurriedly
pulling
and
pinning
there
come
the
boys
to
rehearse
it
ca
be
four
as
the
door
opened
and
three
members
of
the
cast
entered
it
four
said
jasper
laughing
and
pulling
out
his
watch
we
gave
you
an
extra
fifteen
minutes
as
you
had
such
a
lot
to
do
dear
me
but
you
are
fine
phronsie
i
make
my
obeisance
to
princess
clotilde
and
he
bowed
low
to
the
little
silver
and
white
figure
as
did
the
other
two
boys
and
then
drew
off
to
witness
the
final
touches
it
a
most
dreadful
thing
cried
polly
pushing
back
the
brown
waves
from
her
brow
as
she
also
fell
off
to
their
point
of
view
to
get
up
a
princess
i
had
no
idea
it
was
such
a
piece
of
work
you
have
scored
an
immense
success
said
jasper
enthusiastically
oh
phronsie
you
will
make
the
hit
of
the
season
you
think
it
is
even
much
nicer
when
it
is
done
said
polly
vastly
relieved
that
jasper
had
given
such
a
kind
verdict
it
to
have
a
dash
of
royal
purple
on
that
right
side
and
in
one
of
the
shoulder
knots
and
to
catch
up
her
train
that
will
be
very
pretty
i
do
doubt
said
jasper
trying
to
resolve
himself
into
the
cold
critic
but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
almost
perfect
now
polly
oh
thank
you
so
much
she
cried
with
blooming
cheeks
how
do
you
like
it
clare
and
bensie
i
ca
tell
said
ben
slowly
regarding
the
princess
on
all
sides
it
so
transforming
it
tiptop
cried
clare
it
any
princess
i
ever
imagined
well
it
a
perfect
relief
said
polly
to
have
you
boys
come
in
i
been
working
so
over
it
that
i
was
ready
to
say
it
was
horrid
it
too
bad
is
it
that
dick
ca
be
here
to
rehearse
his
part
to
be
sure
exclaimed
jasper
looking
around
where
is
the
princess
page
he
gone
to
the
dentist
said
polly
making
a
wry
face
auntie
had
to
make
the
appointment
for
this
afternoon
and
we
could
put
off
the
rehearsal
clare
ca
come
any
other
time
you
know
phronsie
turned
an
anxious
face
to
the
window
i
hope
he
not
being
hurt
very
much
she
said
slowly
i
do
believe
he
is
polly
made
haste
to
answer
most
cheerfully
it
was
only
one
tooth
you
know
phronsie
to
be
filled
auntie
says
porter
told
her
the
rest
are
all
right
but
a
cloud
rested
on
the
princess
face
one
tooth
is
something
she
said
just
think
how
nice
it
will
be
when
it
is
all
over
and
dick
comes
scampering
in
cried
jasper
with
great
hilarity
do
climb
up
on
the
sofa
phronsie
urged
polly
looking
into
the
pale
little
face
you
must
sit
down
and
rest
a
bit
you
so
tired
i
will
read
the
prologue
while
she
rests
said
jasper
so
you
can
said
polly
take
care
child
in
alarm
you
curl
up
in
the
corner
like
that
princesses
do
ever
do
so
do
they
said
phronsie
flying
off
from
the
lovely
corner
to
straighten
out
again
into
the
dignity
required
not
when
they
are
little
girls
polly
no
indeed
said
polly
with
a
rescuing
hand
among
the
silver
spangles
and
lace
they
must
never
forget
that
they
are
princesses
phronsie
there
now
you
all
right
oh
said
phronsie
sitting
quite
stiffly
glad
if
she
could
not
be
comfortable
she
could
be
a
princess
ladies
and
brave
sirs
began
jasper
in
a
loud
impressive
tone
from
the
temporary
stage
the
large
rug
in
front
of
the
crackling
hearth
fire
clare
burst
into
a
laugh
see
here
now
cried
jasper
brandishing
his
text
at
him
if
you
embarrass
me
like
that
you
may
leave
you
old
dragon
you
ought
to
see
your
face
cried
clare
jap
you
are
anything
but
a
hit
you
be
yet
declared
jasper
with
a
pretended
growl
and
another
flourish
of
the
manuscript
go
on
do
implored
polly
i
think
it
is
lovely
clare
you
really
ought
to
be
ashamed
and
she
shook
her
brown
head
severely
at
him
if
i
do
quench
such
melodrama
in
the
outset
said
clare
ruin
us
all
fair
ladies
and
brave
sirs
mimicking
to
perfection
jasper
tones
thank
you
for
a
hint
cried
jasper
pulling
out
his
pencil
i
say
that
better
than
i
wish
critics
would
always
be
so
useful
as
to
give
one
good
idea
heigho
here
goes
again
ladies
and
brave
sirs
the
player
art
is
to
amuse
instruct
or
to
confuse
by
too
much
good
advice
but
poorly
given
that
no
one
follows
because
forsooth
is
thrown
at
him
neck
and
heels
the
drama
pure
and
simple
is
forgot
in
tugging
in
the
moral
i
thought
you
were
going
to
alter
in
to
something
more
elegant
said
polly
lugging
in
suggested
clare
with
another
laugh
morals
are
always
tugged
in
by
the
head
and
shoulders
said
jasper
why
not
say
so
we
should
have
pretty
much
the
whole
anatomy
of
the
human
form
divine
if
you
had
your
way
cried
clare
listen
forsooth
is
thrown
at
him
neck
and
heels
and
in
the
moral
head
and
shoulders
now
just
add
the
pricking
of
my
thumbs
and
you
have
them
all
jasper
joined
as
well
as
polly
and
ben
in
the
laugh
at
the
expense
but
phronsie
sat
erect
winking
hard
her
royal
hands
folded
quite
still
in
her
lap
you
bound
for
a
newspaper
office
my
boy
said
jasper
at
length
how
you
will
cut
into
the
coming
poet
and
maul
the
fledgling
of
the
prose
writer
well
i
stand
corrected
drama
pure
and
simple
is
forgot
in
straining
at
the
moral
is
that
any
better
to
the
audience
yes
i
think
it
is
said
polly
but
i
do
believe
it
time
to
talk
more
elegantly
jasper
it
is
due
to
the
people
in
the
private
boxes
you
know
oh
the
boxes
are
to
have
things
all
right
before
the
play
is
over
never
you
fear
polly
said
jasper
poor
presentment
you
will
say
we
give
but
cry
you
mercy
sirs
and
i
do
like
you
mercy
announced
ben
slowly
because
it
does
seem
to
mean
anything
oh
do
cut
that
out
exclaimed
polly
clasping
her
hands
and
rushing
up
to
ben
that
my
pet
phrase
you
must
touch
that
bensie
but
it
does
mean
anything
reiterated
ben
in
a
puzzled
way
who
cares
cried
jasper
defiantly
a
great
many
expressions
that
have
the
least
significance
are
put
in
a
thing
of
this
sort
padding
you
know
my
dear
sir
oh
said
ben
literally
i
did
know
as
you
needed
padding
all
right
if
it
is
necessary
it
antique
and
perfectly
lovely
and
just
like
shakespeare
cried
polly
viewing
ben
in
alarm
oh
let
the
bard
of
avon
have
one
say
in
this
production
cried
clare
go
on
do
with
your
you
mercy
what
next
jap
are
you
willing
ben
asked
jasper
with
a
glance
at
polly
ye
es
said
ben
also
gazing
at
the
rosy
face
and
anxious
eyes
it
can
go
as
padding
i
suppose
oh
i
am
so
glad
exclaimed
polly
in
glee
and
dancing
around
the
room
and
you
wo
be
sorry
i
know
bensie
the
audience
will
applaud
that
very
thing
i
almost
sure
which
made
jasper
sternly
resolve
something
on
the
spot
well
i
shall
never
be
through
at
this
rate
he
said
whirling
over
the
manuscript
to
find
his
place
oh
here
i
am
cry
you
mercy
sirs
and
ladies
fair
we
aim
but
to
be
dragons
not
mortals
posing
for
effect
we
have
a
princess
to
be
sure
i
should
think
we
have
interrupted
clare
with
a
glance
over
at
the
sofa
goodness
me
she
fast
asleep
poor
little
thing
she
is
tired
to
death
cried
polly
remorsefully
while
they
all
rushed
over
to
the
heap
of
lace
and
spangles
blissfully
oblivious
of
prologues
do
let
her
sleep
through
this
piece
of
stupidity
said
jasper
bundling
up
another
satin
skirt
that
whitney
had
loaned
for
polly
to
make
a
choice
from
there
putting
it
under
the
yellow
head
we
call
her
when
the
dragons
come
on
take
care
cried
polly
with
intercepting
hand
that
lovely
satin
gown
beg
pardon
said
jasper
relinquishing
it
speedily
here
the
sofa
pillow
after
all
dragging
it
from
its
temporary
retirement
under
the
theatrical
debris
now
let
get
back
to
work
time
is
going
fast
in
a
lowered
voice
have
a
princess
to
be
sure
a
sweet
and
gracious
clotilde
and
a
knight
who
does
her
homage
but
the
rest
of
us
are
fishy
scaly
horny
and
altogether
horrid
and
of
very
low
degree
who
scarce
know
why
we
are
upon
the
boards
except
for
your
amusement
so
prithee
hold
cried
clare
what
stuff
give
me
an
inch
of
time
cried
jasper
hurrying
on
and
i
end
the
misery
prithee
be
amused
we
undone
if
you
are
not
and
all
our
labor
lost
pray
laugh
and
shake
your
sides
and
say
is
good
i
faith
is
very
good
and
we
shall
say
your
intellects
do
you
credit
and
so
we
bid
you
a
fond
adieu
and
haste
away
to
unshackle
the
dragons
who
even
now
do
roar
without
clare
threw
himself
into
the
part
of
the
dragons
and
forgetful
of
phronsie
gave
a
loud
roar
polly
clapped
her
hands
and
tossed
an
imaginary
bouquet
as
jasper
bowed
himself
off
hush
said
ben
you
wake
up
phronsie
but
it
was
too
late
there
she
sat
rubbing
her
eyes
in
astonishment
oh
you
darling
cried
polly
running
over
to
her
to
clasp
her
in
her
arms
i
so
sorry
i
tired
you
all
out
phronsie
dear
do
forgive
me
i
not
tired
said
phronsie
with
dewy
eyes
has
jasper
got
through
reading
what
was
it
all
about
polly
indeed
and
i
have
finished
he
cried
with
a
yawn
and
throwing
the
manuscript
on
the
table
and
i
do
know
in
the
least
what
it
is
all
about
phronsie
just
a
lot
of
dreadful
words
said
clare
over
in
the
corner
pulling
at
a
heap
of
costumes
on
the
floor
never
mind
the
horrible
spell
is
broken
come
on
you
fellows
and
tumble
into
your
dragon
skins
with
that
the
chief
dragon
deserted
phronsie
and
presently
there
resounded
the
rattle
of
the
scales
the
clanking
of
chains
and
the
dragging
about
of
the
rest
of
their
paraphernalia
now
phronsie
said
jasper
coming
back
his
dragon
skin
and
gesticulating
you

that
it
only
i
in
this
thing

here

in
my
head
and
he
pulled
on
the
scaly
covering
observing
great
care
to
smile
reassuringly
the
last
thing
before
his
countenance
was
obscured
phronsie
screamed
with
delight
and
clapped
her
hands
oh
jasper

me
have
one
on

much
rather

a
dragon
than

jasper
in
a
muffled
voice

i

said
ben
turning
around

fearfully
i
run
and
ask
mamsie

polly

father
said
marian
going
back
with
a
smile
to
her
correspondence
half
an
hour
later
thomas
with
the
aid
of
the
horses
and
the
shopping
coupe
having
carried
off
chatterton
whitney
pushed
aside
her
notes
and
ran
down
to
her
father
study
she
found
him
in
his
velvet
seated
before
his
table
busy
with
a
list
of
names
that
was
rapidly
growing
longer
under
his
pen
oh
i
forgot
he
said

up
i
intended
to
tell
you
to
bring
some
of
your
cards
and
envelopes

marian
looking
over
his
shoulder
oh

the
length
of
your
list

evening
affair
or
a
musicale

along
daughter
said
the
old
gentleman
and
get
what
i
tell
you
this
is
my
affair
it
a
musicale
and
something
else
combined
i
do
just

myself
and
he
laughed
at
the
sight
of
her
face
if
father
is
only
pleased
i
do
care
what
it
is
said
whitney
to
herself
hurrying
over
the
stairs
and
back
again
never
once
thinking
of
polly
and
jasper
surprise
for
the
boys
you
see
marian
said
king
as
she
sat
down
by
the
table
and
laid
the
cards
and
envelopes
in
front
of
him
that
i
going
to
help
out
that
affair
that
jasper
and
polly
are
getting
up
oh
father
how
good
of
you
exclaimed
whitney
in
a
delighted
tone
which
immensely
pleased
the
old
gentleman
to
begin
with
they
been
working
very
hard
those
two
at
their
studies
this
autumn
i
seen
them
cried
king
with
a
shrewd
air
and
going
now
to
give
them
a
little
pleasure
marian
said
nothing
but
let
him
have
the
comfort
of
doing
all
the
talking
which
he
now
enjoyed
to
his
heart
content
whether
the
other
chaps
have
done
well
i
do
know
davie
may
have
kept
at
it
but
i
suspect
the
rest
of
the
boys
have
killed
themselves
with
hard
study
but
they
shall
have
a
good
at
any
rate
whitney
smiled
and
he
proceeded
now
i
going
to
send
out
these
invitations
he
pushed
the
list
toward
her
i
shall
have
the
and
floors
covered
and
all
extra
seats
arranged
give
turner
carte
blanche
as
to
flowers
if
he
ca
furnish
enough
out
of
our
own
conservatories
and
the
evening
will
end
with
a
handsome
as
jasper
calls
it
in
short
i
shall
recognize
their
attempt
to
make
it
pleasant
for
the
boys
holiday
by
helping
them
out
on
the
affair
all
i
can
the
old
gentleman
now
leaned
back
in
his
big
chair
and
studied
his
face
and
you
never
regret
it
father
she
cried
with
an
enthusiasm
that
satisfied
him
for
these
young
people
will
all
repay
you
a
i
do
believe
in
the
time
to
come
do
i
know
it
cried
king
getting
out
of
his
chair
hastily
to
pace
the
floor
goodness
me
they
repay
me
already
they
fine
young
things
every
one
of
them
whitneys
peppers
and
my
boy
as
fine
as
they
are
made
and
whoever
says
they
not
does
know
a
good
piece
of
work
when
it
before
his
eyes
bless
me
pulling
out
his
handkerchief
to
mop
his
face
violently
i
do
want
to
see
any
finer
i
hope
i
shall
have
a
sight
of
jasper
and
polly
faces
when
you
tell
them
what
you
intend
to
do
said
whitney
where
are
your
cards
father
tell
them
i
sha
tell
them
at
all
cried
the
old
gentleman
going
to
have
a
surprise
too
no
one
must
know
it
but
you
and
mrs
pepper
oh
said
whitney
it
was
very
stupid
in
me
not
to
understand
that
it
will
be
all
right
father
pepper
and
i
will
keep
our
secret
you
need
fear
if
you
can
only
keep
her
out
of
the
way
exclaimed
king
pointing
irascibly
in
the
direction
of
chatterton
apartments
all
will
be
well
but
i
doubt
if
you
can
her
meddlesome
ears
and
tongue
will
be
at
work
as
usual
he
added
in
extreme
vexation
here
comes
jasper
exclaimed
whitney
which
had
the
satisfactory
result
of
bringing
her
father
out
of
his
irritation
into
a
flutter
over
the
concealment
of
the
party
preparations
jasper
cried
polly
that
evening
as
they
ran
into
the
to
play
a
duet
we
all
right
about
everything
now
as
your
father
says
we
may
invite
the
girls
and
your
friends
and
he
said
when
i
asked
him
if
we
ought
not
to
have
cake
and
coffee
attend
to
that
said
jasper
so
everything
is
all
straight
as
far
as
i
can
see
polly
the
private
boxes
trouble
me
i
must
confess
said
polly
drumming
absently
on
the
keys
while
jasper
spread
the
sheet
of
music
on
the
rack
you
know
there
must
be
two
one
for
dear
king
and
one
for
the
boys
as
guests
of
honor
now
how
shall
we
manage
them
she
took
her
hand
off
suddenly
from
the
keys
and
folded
it
over
its
fellow
on
her
knee
to
study
his
face
anxiously
it
pretty
hard
to
get
them
up
that
a
fact
said
jasper
truthfully
but
then
you
know
polly
we
always
found
that
when
a
thing
had
to
be
done
it
was
done
you
know
the
little
brown
house
taught
us
that
so
it
did
said
polly
brightening
up
dear
little
old
brown
house
how
could
i
ever
forget
it
well
i
suppose
with
a
sigh
it
will
come
to
us
as
an
inspiration
when
it
time
to
fix
them
i
suppose
so
too
said
pepper
passing
the
door
as
usual
with
her
mending
basket
and
when
two
people
start
to
play
a
duet
i
think
they
much
better
put
their
minds
on
that
and
not
waste
precious
time
on
all
sorts
of
questions
that
will
take
care
of
themselves
when
the
time
comes
you
are
right
pepper
cried
jasper
with
a
laugh
and
seating
himself
before
the
piano
come
polly
mamsie
is
always
right
is
she
jasper
cried
polly
with
pride
putting
her
hands
down
for
the
first
chords
indeed
she
is
responded
the
boy
heartily
here
now
polly
remember
you
slipped
up
a
bit
on
that
first
bar
now
the
of
december
came
all
too
soon
for
polly
and
jasper
whose
school
duties
had
engrossed
them
till
two
days
before
but
after
hard
work
getting
up
the
stage
properties
and
the
many
rehearsals
everything
was
at
last
pronounced
ready
the
and
locked
the
keys
given
to
whitney
who
promised
faithfully
to
see
that
no
one
peeped
in
who
should
not
and
polly
hurried
into
her
hat
and
jacket
to
go
to
the
station
with
jasper
to
meet
the
boys
thomas
drove
furiously
as

touching
his
hat
and
indulging
in
broad
smiles
of
content
polly
was
tiptoeing
in
very
delight
holding
davie
hand
closely
while
her
eyes
roved
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
boys
and
her
tongue
ran
fast
indeed
a
group
of
girls
who
had
also
come
down
to
the
station
to
meet

by

the
two

she
scampered
off

funny
said
percy
jumping
in
after
van
opened
his
lips
to
tell
where
jasper
had
gone

remembering
percy
delight
in
such
an
expedition
he
closed
them
quickly
and
added
himself
to

good
strong
legs
now
cried
lustily
go

thomas
get
ahead
as
fast
as

and
presently
he
was
lost
in
the
babel
of
laughter
and
chatter
going
on
in
the
coach
i
a
piece
of
news
presently
cried
van
in
a
lull
bringing
home
a
prize

van
flaming
up
and
whirling
away
from
his
window
you
did
take
any
either
polly
his
head
was
under
water
all
the
time
unless
some
of
the
boys
tugged
him
along
every
day
we
hardly
got
him
home
at
all
no
such

contradicted
percy
flatly
his

growing
red
polly
he
tells

believe
him
polly
you

to
his

said
polly
in
a
low
voice
and
with
her
most
superb
air
stepping
down
alone
she
ran
up
the
steps
to
leave
them
staring
in
each
other
faces
here
everybody
came
hurrying
out
to
the
porch
and
they
were
soon
drawn
into
the
warm
loving
welcome
awaiting
them
oh

dreadful
commotion
in

among

jasper
out
in
the
green
room
i
imagine
every

i
do
see
how
they
can
make
such
a
noise
oh
a
few
girls
and
boys
make
just
about
as
much
confusion
as
a
good
many
observed
polly
jasper
would
you
like
to
see
joel
eyes
when
aunt
whitney
leads
him
into
the
private
box
she
allowed
herself
time
to
exclaim
yes
laughed
jasper
pulling
out
his
watch
from
beneath
his
well
we
have
only
five
minutes
more
polly
we
must
have
the
curtain
up

o

cried
polly
flying
here
and
there
to
bestow
last
touches
on
the
different
members
of
her
cast
now
clare
you
must
remember
not
to

such
a
shriek
when

jappy
just
a
dull
sullen
roar

dragon
face

good
look
at
the
audience
come
phronsie
here
a
fine
place

boys
the
different
members
of
the
cast
now
applied
their
eyes
to
as
many
cracks
in
the
curtain
as
could
be
hastily
managed
there
was
a
breathing
space
what
what
cried
polly
gazing
into
the
sea
of
faces
and
the
dragons
nearly
knocked
the
princess
over
as
king
gave
the
signal
for
the
band
stationed
in
the
wide
hall
to
send
out
their
merriest
strains
v
after
the
play
it
was
all
over
phronsie
had
been
swept
off
a
vision
of
loveliness
to
the
cave
the
dragons
had
roared
their
loudest
and
the
gallant
knight
had
covered
himself
with
glory
in
the
brilliant
rescue
of
the
princess
the
little
page
had
won
the
hearts
of
all
the
ladies
king
had
applauded
himself
hoarse
especially
during
the
delivery
of
the
prologue
when
i
cry
you
mercy
sirs
and
ladies
fair
rang
out
the
musical
efforts
of
polly
and
jasper
in
the
wait
between
the
two
acts
were
over
and
the
crowded
house
in
every
way
possible
had
expressed
itself
delighted
with
all
things
from
beginning
to
end
phronsie
phronsie
they
calling

whispered
polly
excitedly
out
in
the
green
room
come
princess
the
head
dragon
held
out
his
hand
hurry

polly
giving
her
a
gentle
push
forward

phronsie
refusing
to

and
holding

by

ca
phronsie
cried
polly
in
distress
do
you
see
they
have
called
me

child
if
you
love
me
she
implored
phronsie
not
being
able
to
resist
this
dropped
polly
gown
and
floated
before
the
footlights
thank
you
she
said
bowing
gravely
to
the
sea
of
faces
as
her
hands
were
filled
with
roses
but
i
shall
give
these
to
polly
because
we
could
any
of
us
have
done
it
without
her
and
so
she
brought
them
back
to
put
into
dismayed
polly
lap
the
authors
the
authors
of
the
play
cried
a
strong
voice
privately
urged
on
by
king
there
now
your
turn
cried
clare
to
polly
and
go
ahead
old
dragon
to
jasper
make
your
prettiest
bow
so
the
chief
dragon
led
up
blushing
polly
to
the
front
of
the
stage
to
hear
a
neat
little
speech
from
alstyne
thanking
them
for
the
pleasure
of
the
evening
and
congratulating
them
on
its
success
and
the
band
played
again
the
camp
chairs
were
folded
up
and
removed
the
and
stage
were
deserted
and
actors
and
audience
mingled
in
a
gay
confusing
throng
phronsie
in
her
little
silver
and
white
gown
and
gleaming
cap
began
to
wander
among
the
guests
unconscious
that
she
had
not
on
the
red
cashmere
dress
she
had
worn
all
day
groups
stopped
their
conversation
to
take
her
into
their
midst
passing
her
on
at
last
as
one
might
hand
over
a
precious
parcel
to
the
next
waiting
hands
polly
seeing
that
she
was
well
cared
for
gave
herself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
evening
well
sir
how
did
you
like
it
asked
jasper
with
a
small
pat
on
joel
back
well
enough
said
joel
but
why
did
you
make
more
of
it
you
could
have
crawled
up
on
top
of
the
cave
and
slashed
around
there
and
you
old
dragons
were
just
three
muffs
in
the
last
act
i
rather
have
had
polly
in
the
play
she
twice
the
go
in
her
so
would
we
all
have
preferred
polly
cried
jasper
bursting
into
a
laugh
but
she
would
act
she
directed
everything
she
was
all
the
play
in
fact
polly
meanwhile
was
saying
to
pickering
dodge
no
not
you
must
dance
with
one
of
the
other
girls
but
i
do
choose
to
dance
with
anybody
but
you
said
pickering
holding
out
his
hand
come
polly
you
ca
refuse
they
forming
the
lancers
hurry
polly
feet
twitched
nervously
under
her
white
gown
and
she
longed
more
than
ever
after
the
excitement
she
had
passed
through
to
lose
herself
in
the
witching
music
and
the
mazy
dance
she
hesitated
a
bit
but
just
then
glancing
across
the
room
come
she
said
i
want
you
to
dance
with
ray
simmons
you
ca
refuse
using
his
own
words
and
before
he
was
conscious
how
it
was
done
he
was
by
ray
side
and
asking
for
the
pleasure
of
the
dance
polly
stood
quite
still
and
saw
them
go
away
and
take
the
last
places
in
the
set
and
a
sorry
little
droop
fell
upon
the
curves
of
the
laughing
mouth
she
was
very
tired
and
the
elation
that
had
possessed
her
over
the
success
of
the
evening
was
fast
dropping
out
now
that
everybody
was
enjoying
themselves
in
their
own
way
leaving
her
alone
she
felt
left
out
in
the
cold
and
though
she
fought
against
it
a
faint
feeling
of
regret
stole
over
her
for
what
she
had
done
she
almost
wished
she
was
standing
there
by
the
side
of
pickering
dodge
one
of
the
bright
group
on
whom
the
eyes
of
the
older
people
were
all
turned
as
they
waited
for
the
first
figure
to
begin
well
polly
it
was
alstyne
who
spoke
and
he
acted
as
if
he
had
come
to
stay
by
her
side
you
covered
yourself
with
glory
this
evening
have
i
sir
asked
polly
absently
wishing
there
had
been
less
of
the
glory
and
a
little
more
fun
yes
indeed
said
alstyne
his
keen
eyes
searching
her
face
well
now
polly
your
dragons
although
not
exactly
like
any
living
ones
extant
made
me
think
of
some
i
saw
at
the
zoo
in
london
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
how
oh
if
you
please
cried
polly
her
color
coming
back
and
beginning
to
forget
the
dance
and
the
dancers
let
us
sit
down
here
then
said
alstyne
drawing
her
off
to
two
chairs
in
a
corner
and
you
shall
have
the
tale
no
pun
polly
you
know
and
he
plunged
into
it
at
once
yes
alstyne
has
her
all
right
king
was
saying
at
the
further
end
of
the
to
pepper
he
spied
the
whole
thing
he
take
care
of
her
you
may
depend
and
two
more
people
had
seen
one
was
jasper
nevertheless
his
partner
alexia
rhys
thought
it
necessary
to
enlighten
him
just
think
polly
given
up
her
chance
with
the
best
dancer
in
the
room
and
sent
pickering
dodge
off
with
that
horrid
ray
simmons
jasper
pretended
not
to
hear
this
is
our
figure
he
said
hastily
and
they
whirled
off
finished
it
and
were
back
again
is
she
a
goose
as
he
fanned
her
and
tried
to
introduce
another
subject
i
suppose
she
best
pleases
herself
said
the
boy
indifferently
why
should
any
one
else
interfere
in
the
matter
but
some
one
else
ought
to
interfere
cried
alexia
with
a
little
pout
provoked
at
his
indifference
that
just
the
way
she
does
in
school
all
the
time
oh
i
vexed
at
her
i
can
tell
you
she
so
silly
dear
me
it
our
turn
again
by
the
next
interim
she
had
forgotten
all
about
polly
and
whether
she
was
having
a
nice
time
or
the
stupidest
one
imaginable
for
joel
who
held
dancing
in
great
contempt
sauntered
up
are
you
glad
now
that
you
did
find
out
about
the
secret
cried
alexia
radiantly
oh
you
are
such
a
nuisance
joey
she
added
frankly
phooh
exclaimed
joel
it
was
worth
finding
out
that
old
secret
but
it
as
good
as
girls
ever
get
up
he
finished
with
a
supercilious
air
it
was
a
perfectly
splendid
play
cried
alexia
and
much
too
good
for
a
lot
of
boys
goodness
joey
i
would
celebrate
if
you
four
were
coming
home
from
school
to
our
house
i
have
the
jollification
the
night
before
you
went
back
i
would
go
home
if
was
to
your
house
declared
joel
with
equal
candor
i
run
off
to
sea
first
come
come
you
two
stop
sparring
cried
jasper
holding
out
his
hand
its
our
turn
again
alexia
joel
take
yourself
off
alexia
flashing
joel
a
bright
smile
dashed
off
into
the
figure
said
joel
with
a
smile
as
cheery
for
he
really
liked
her
the
best
of
all
polly
girl
friends
after
the
dance
supper
was
announced
and
everybody
marched
out
to
the
supper
room
the
dancers
with
their
partners
following
will
you
allow
me
alstyne
seeing
the
movement
got
out
of
his
chair
and
offered
his
arm
to
polly
with
a
courtly
bow
oh
do
think
of
me
sir
she
began
blushing
very
hard
joel
will
look
out
for
me
i
much
prefer
waiting
upon
miss
polly
pepper
to
any
other
lady
in
the
room
said
alstyne
with
another
bow
courtlier
than
the
first
since
alstyne
is
provided
for
see
polly
king
is
taking
her
out
and
your
mother
has
her
cavalier
in
cabot
and
whitney
has
already
gone
out
with
fairfax
so
if
you
do
accept
my
services
i
shall
be
entirely
left
out
in
the
cold
he
stood
offering
his
arm
and
polly
laughing
merrily
put
her
hand
within
it
it
very
good
of
you
sir
she
said
simply
as
they
fell
into
step
and
joined
the
procession
i
afraid
if
you
had
trusted
to
joel
tender
mercies
you
would
have
fared
hardly
said
alstyne
laughing
look
polly
over
yonder
in
the
corner
they
were
just
passing
into
the
supper
room
and
now
caught
sight
of
joel
chatting
away
to
a
very
pretty
little
creature
in
blue
and
white
as
busily
and
unconcernedly
as
if
he
had
done
that
sort
of
thing
for
years
why
cried
polly
quite
aghast
that
ca
be
joel
he
just
hates
girls
you
know
alstyne
and
never
goes
to
parties
he
seems
to
be
able
to
endure
it
all
very
well
said
her
companion
dryly
shall
i
get
you
an
ice
miss
polly
yes
thank
you
said
polly
absently
not
being
able
to
take
her
eyes
from
joel
and
his
friend
at
last
by
the
force
of
attraction
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
but
instead
of
showing
his
round
eyes
surveyed
her
coolly
while
he
went
on
talking
and
laughing
with
the
little
thing
polly
polly
exclaimed
alexia
rhys
hurrying
up
while
jasper
was
storming
the
supper
table
for
her
do
look
at
joel
pepper
he
actually
brought
in
a
girl
to
supper
i
see
said
polly
gazing
at
the
two
in
a
fascinated
way
on
the
other
hand
said
alexia
sending
swift
glances
around
the
supper
room
there
are
van
and
percy
moping
off
by
themselves
as
if
they
had
a
friend
in
the
world
what
a
pity
they
used
to
be
so
lively
at
parties
polly
wrenched
her
gaze
away
from
the
astonishing
sight
on
which
it
had
been
fixed
and
following
alexia
glance
took
a
keen
look
over
at
the
young
whitneys
oh
oh
i
must
go
to
them
she
cried
remorsefully
tell
alstyne
please
when
he
comes
back
where
i
am
and
without
another
word
she
dashed
back
of
some
gaily
dressed
ladies
just
entering
the
supper
room
and
was
out
of
the
door
if
i
ever
did
cried
alexia
irritably
to
herself
see
anything
so
queer
now
she
thinks
she
must
race
after
those
boys
i
wish
i
kept
still
jasper
she
just
as
funny
as
ever
as
he
came
up
with
a
plate
of
salad
and
some
oysters
who
said
the
boy
is
this
right
alexia
offering
the
plate
why
polly
said
alexia
yes
that
lovely
with
a
comforted
glance
at
the
plate
and
its
contents
oh
she
gone
off
alstyne
to
that
gentleman
approaching
with
polly
ice
you
expect
her
to
stay
for
the
goodies
beginning
to
nibble
at
her
own
where
is
she
cried
alstyne
laughing
and
sweeping
the
room
with
his
brown
eyes
oh
i
see
his
glance
lighting
on
the
whitney
corner
yes
she
told
me
to
tell
you
said
alexia
between
her
mouthfuls
of
salad
and
oyster
where
she
is
as
he
started
oh
percy
and
van
polly
was
whispering
hurriedly
i
sorry
i
hurt
your
feelings
only
it
was
so
very
dreadful
you
know
to
hear
you
go
on
so
to
each
other
we
did
mean
anything
said
percy
pushing
one
foot
back
and
forth
in
an
embarrassed
way
and
looking
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
which
confused
him
more
than
anything
else
as
he
had
been
quite
sure
of
them
on
all
previous
occasions
van
thrust
his
into
his
pockets
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
whistling
but
remembering
where
he
was
took
his
lips
speedily
out
of
their
curves
and
looked
the
other
way
just
then
alstyne
came
up
oh
cried
polly
suddenly
the
color
rushing
over
her
face
could
you
alstyne
give
that
to
some
one
else
percy
and
van
are
going
to
wait
upon
me
yes
indeed
said
alstyne
in
a
flash
nothing
easier
and
he
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
he
came
now
boys
said
polly
turning
back
to
them
and
whispering
busily
i
know
you
wo
ever
say
such
perfectly
dreadful
things
to
each
other
again
and
so
i
going
to
ask
you

to
get
me
something
to
eat
will
you
how
do
you
know
we
wo
cried
percy
slowly
he
was
sorry
enough
for
the
episode
in
the
coach
yet
could
resist
the
temptation
to
show
he
was
not
to
be
driven
because
i
shall
then
have
nothing
whatever
to
eat
said
polly
merrily
for
of
course
i
ca
take
a
bit
from
anybody
else
after
refusing
alstyne
kindness
do
you
see
oh
percy

quite
do
that
van
laughed
she

us
percy
he
said
quite
fast

i
wo
again
we
both
said
so
a
little
while
back
so
what

good
of

percy
drew
himself
up
very
slowly
and
decidedly
i
wo
trouble
you
so
again
polly
holding
out
his
hand
now
would
you
like
oysters
all
in
the
same
breath
and
here
mine
cried
van
extending
his
brown
one
ca
i
bring
you
some
salad
yes
yes
cried
polly
gaily
and
she
released
their
hands
after
a
cordial
grasp
you
may
bring
me
everything
straight
through
boys
as
they
rushed
off
heads
erect
to
the
crowded
you
had
a
good
time
asked
pepper
slowly
with
a
keen
glance
into
the
flushed
face
and
sparkling
eyes
as
they
turned
up
the
gas
in
polly
bedroom
dear
me

is
eleven
splendid
said
polly
shaking
herself
free
from
the
white

and

to

her
hair
for
the
night

perfectly
lovely
and
alstyne

to

boys

have
thanked

enough

is
indeed
said
pepper
heartily
why
where
is
phronsie
looking
around
the
room
she
was
right
back
of
you
said
polly
she
wanted
to
take
off
her
things
herself
did
you
ever
see
such
a
sweet
she
began
but
pepper
did
not
stop
to
hear
hurrying
out
to
the
adjoining
room
shared
by
the
mother
and
her
baby
she
is
here
polly
heard
her
say
in
bewildered
tones
so
polly
her
long
hair
blown
about
her
face
ran
in
brush
in
hand
why
where
she
began
laughingly
she
would
go
downstairs
i
do
think
said
pepper
peering
in
all
the
corners
and
even
meditating
a
look
under
the
bed
no
no
cried
polly
the
lights
are
all
turned
out
investigating
all
possible
and
impossible
nooks
that
a
mouse
could
creep
into
where
can
she
be
phronsie
phronsie
well
of
course
she
is
downstairs
declared
pepper
at
last
hurrying
out
of
the
room
take
a
candle
mamsie
you
fall
cried
polly
and
throwing
on
her
bath
wrapper
she
seized
the
light
from
the
mantel
and
hurried
after
her
down
she
could
hear
phronsie
gay
little
laugh
and
catch
the
words
my
dear
grandpapa
and
then
she
came
slowly
out
from
king
and
softly
closed
the
door
phronsie
exclaimed
polly
sitting
down
on
the
middle
of
the
stairs
the
candle
shaking
ominously
how
could
hush
said
pepper
who
had
fumbled
her
way
along
the
hall
do
say
anything
oh
phronsie
dear
so
you
went
down
to
bid
grandpapa
did
you
phronsie
turned
a
glance
of
gentle
surprise
on
her
mother
and
then
looked
up
at
polly
no
not
exactly
to
bid
him
she
said
slowly
i
was
afraid
he
was
sick
i
heard
him
coughing
so
i
went
down
he
is
quite
well
is
he
asked
pepper
here
give
me
your
hand
child
we
must
get
up
to
bed
oh
yes
he
is
quite
really
and
truly
all
well
declared
phronsie
breaking
into
another
glad
little
laugh
he
said
he
never
had
such
a
beautiful
time
in
his
life
and
he
is
just
as
well
as
he
can
be
oh
polly
as
she
picked
up
her
princess
gown
and
prepared
to
ascend
the
stairs
how
funny
you
look
sitting
there
funny
said
polly
grimly
i
dare
say
and
i
feel
funny
too
phronsie
vi
the
little
brown
house
they
were
all
sitting
around
the
library
fire
polly
under
the
pretext
of
holding
phronsie
head
in
her
lap
was
sitting
on
the
rug
beside
her
the
boys
on
either
hand
old
king
was
marching
up
and
down
the
long
room
and
looking
at
them
the
merriest
of
stories
had
been
told
polly
urging
on
all
the
school
records
of
jolly
times
and
those
not
so
enjoyable
songs
had
been
sung
and
all
sorts
of
nonsense
aired
at
last
joel
sprang
up
and
ran
over
to
pace
by
the
old
gentleman
side
christmas
was
good
enough
said
the
boy
by
way
of
beginning
conversation
hey
responded
the
old
gentleman
looking
down
at
him
i
should
think
it
was
well
and
how
about
the
wonderful
play
on
the
and
that
was
good
enough
too
i
dare
say
that
was
well
enough
said
joel
indifferently
i
do
care
for
such
stuff
though
tut
tut
cried
king
in
pretended
anger
now
i
wo
have
anything
said
against
that
wonderful
production
not
a
thing
sir
do
you
hear
joel
laughed
his
chubby
face
twinkling
all
over
in
secret
amusement
well
i
know
something
better
if
you
only
let
us
do
it
sir
than
a
hundred
old
plays
and
pray
what
is
it
demanded
king
let
have
it
at
once
but
the
idea
of
surpassing
the
play
oh
no
no
it
ca
be
done
sir
it
to
go
and
see
the
little
brown
house
said
joel
standing
up
on
his
tiptoes
to
a
level
with
the
old
gentleman
ear
and
one
eye
looking
backward
to
see
that
nobody
heard
king
started
pulled
his
handsome
moustache
thoughtfully
looked
at
joel
sharply
and
then
over
at
the
group
in
the
firelight
they
do
know
anything
about
it
cried
the
boy
in
a
whisper
tell
them
it
my
secret
and
yours
he
added
generously
oh
if
we
might
only
go
and
look
at
it
it
winter
observed
the
old
gentleman
and
stepping
to
the
window
he
put
aside
the
draperies
to
peer
out
into
the
black
evening
yes
it
really
is
winter
he
added
with
a
shiver
to
the
boy
who
was
close
behind
and
as
if
no
longer
in
doubt
about
it
he
added
most
emphatically
it
really
is
winter
joel
well
but
you
never
saw
anything
like
it
how
magnificent
winter
is
in
badgertown
cried
joel
in
an
excited
whisper
such
hills
to
coast
down
the
snow
is
always
crisp
there
sir
not
like
this
dirty
town
mud
and
the
air
is
as
dry
as
punk
he
added
artfully
oh
be
such
a
lark
he
actually
clasped
his
hands
badgertown
is
so
very
far
off
said
king
thoughtfully
think
about
it
and
see
if
we
can
manage
it
squealed
joel
utterly
forgetful
of
his
caution
of
secrecy
we
can
we
can
we
can
open
the
little
brown
house
and
build
great
fires
there
and
but
he
got
no
further
into
the
midst
of
liveliest
sally
came
the
words
little
brown
house
bringing
all
the
young
people
to
their
feet
phronsie
running
to
the
old
side
with
what
is
it
grandpapa
he
said
the
little
brown
house
get
away
cried
joel
crossly
to
the
besiegers
each
and
all
wildly
clamoring
what
is
it
what
are
you
talking
about
it
my
secret
he
cried
and
his
pointing
with
a
dismayed
finger
to
king
well
it
is
a
secret
any
longer
cried
polly
flushing
with
excitement
you
said
brown
house
we
heard
you
just
as
plainly
and
you
re
getting
up
something
i
know
you
are
people
do
usually
select
a
roomful
of
listeners
and
then
shout
out
their
secrets
said
jasper
you
are
in
for
it
now
joe
and
no
mistake
go
ahead
old
fellow
and
give
us
the
rest
of
it
joel
whirled
away
from
them
all
in
desperation
you
might
as
well
laughed
the
old
gentleman
the
mischief
is
done
now
and
no
mistake
so
joel
thus
set
upon
allowed
the
whole
beautiful
plan
to
be
wrung
from
him
by
slow
and
torturing
installments
how
they
all
were
to
go
to
badgertown
open
the
little
brown
house
and
stay
there
here
he
glanced
at
king
perhaps
a
week
he
brought
out
suddenly
filling
the
time
with
all
sorts
of
frolics
and
playing
they
were
there
again
and
really
and
truly
living
in
the
old
home
at
last
it
was
all
out
to
be
received
in
different
ways
by
the
listeners
oh
joe
cried
davie
with
shining
eyes
we
never
could
come
away
again
if
we
once
get
there
never
polly
stood
quite
still
a
mist
gathering
before
her
glad
eyes
out
of
which
she
dimly
saw
the
little
brown
house
arise
and
beckon
to
her
phronsie
jumped
up
and
down
and
clapped
her
hands
in
glee
oh
grandpapa
grandpapa
she
screamed
please
take
us
to
the
little
brown
house
please
that
settled
it
i
do
not
think
we
need
to
consider
it
longer
said
king
glancing
at
ben
whose
face
told
what
he
thought
children
we
will
go
that
is
if
pepper
says
yes
i
will
ask
her
cried
joel
with
a
howl
springing
off
come
on
cried
jasper
let
all
in
at
the
death
and
the
library
was
deserted
in
a
twinkling
but
mother
was
nowhere
to
be
found
upstairs
downstairs
and
in
the
lady
chamber
they
sought
her
wildly
oh
i
forgot
exclaimed
polly
when
at
last
they
gathered
in
the
wide
hall
disposing
themselves
on
the
chairs
and
along
the
stairs
all
tired
out
she
has
gone
to
evening
meeting
with
auntie
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
remember
that
well
i
declare
cried
a
voice
above
them
and
looking
up
they
met
the
cold
blue
eyes
of
chatterton
regarding
them
over
the
railing
cousin
horatio
do
you
keep
a
menagerie
or
a
house
i
beg
to
inquire
a
menagerie
said
king
coolly
leaning
on
the
balustrade
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
looking
up
at
her
all
sorts
of
strange
animals
wander
in
here
cousin
hum
i
understand
i
not
so
dull
as
you
think
well
you
changed
let
me
tell
you
vastly
and
not
for
the
better
either
in
the
last
six
years
who
would
ever
suppose
i
see
before
me
fastidious
horatio
king
she
exclaimed
lifting
her
long
thin
hands
to
show
him
their
palms
i
dare
say
i
dare
say
cousin
eunice
assented
king
carelessly
but
i
consider
all
you
say
as
a
compliment
compliment
she
repeated
disdainfully
and
added
with
a
rising
note
of
anger
forgetting
herself
there
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
so
i
think
said
king
in
the
same
tone
as
before
children
come
into
my
room
now
and
close
the
door
and
cousin
eunice
was
left
to
air
further
opinions
to
her
own
ear
but
when
mother
pepper
and
whitney
did
come
home
from
the
meeting
oh
what
a
time
there
was
they
all
fell
upon
her
as
soon
as
the
door
opened
and
the
whole
air
was
filled
with
little
brown
house
may
we
may
we
a
whole
week
two
days
mamsie
do
say
yes
and
phronsie
glad
little
chirp
grandpapa
wants
to
go
he
does
ending
every
other
exclamation
what
a
babel
cried
pepper
her
black
eyes
roving
over
the
excited
group
now
what
is
it
all
about
baby
you
tell
mother
first
phronsie
was
not
too
big
to
jump
into
the
comfortable
lap
and
while
her
fingers
played
with
the
bonnet
strings
she
laid
the
whole
delightful
plan
open
the
others
hanging
over
them
in
excitement
well
you
see
mamsie
she
began
deliberately
oh
you
are
so
slow
phronsie
exclaimed
polly
do
hurry
let
her
take
her
own
time
said
king
go
on
child
dear
grandpapa
proceeded
phronsie
turning
her
yellow
head
to
look
at
him
her
hand
yet
among
the
bonnet
strings
is
going
to
take
us
all
every
single
one
to
see
the
little
brown
house
and
just
touch
it
once
and
be
sure
it
there
and
peek
in
the
doors
and
windows
and
no
no
roared
joel
we
going
to
stay
and
a
week
too
hopping
confidently
up
and
down
oh
joe
not
a
week
corrected
polly
with
glowing
cheeks
perhaps
two
days
we
do
know
yet
three
three
begged
van
pushing
his
head
further
into
the
center
of
the
group
pepper
do
say
you
want
to
stay
three
days
he
begged
i
have
said
i
wanted
to
go
yet
she
answered
with
a
smile
now
every
one
of
you
keep
quiet
commanded
king
raising
his
hand
or
you
spoil
the
whole
thing
phronsie
shall
tell
her
story
as
she
likes
thereupon
the
rest
with
the
shadow
of
his
warning
that
the
whole
might
be
spoiled
fell
back
to
a
vigorous
restraint
once
more
perhaps
cried
phronsie
with
shining
eyes
and
grasping
the
strings
tighter
she
leaned
forward
and
pressed
her
red
lips
on
the
mouth
we
go
in
and
stay
oh
mamsie
that
oh
mamsie
carried
the
day
and
every
one
hanging
on
the
conversation
knew
as
soon
as
they
heard
it
that
a
victory
had
been
won
it
no
use
to
contend
against
the
fates
said
whitney
laughing
pepper
you
and
i
know
that
that
so
cried
old
king
and
whoever
finds
it
out
early
in
life
is
the
lucky
one
now
children
off
with
you
and
talk
it
over
he
cried
dismissing
them
as
if
they
were
all
below
their
teens
i
want
to
talk
with
pepper
now
and
in
two
days
they
were
ready
to
go
chatterton
with
nose
high
in
the
air
and
plentiful
expressions
of
disgust
at
such
a
expedition
taking
herself
off
to
make
a
visit
of
corresponding
length
to
some
distant
relatives
i
hope
and
pray
this
may
not
get
into
a
society
paper
she
cried
at
the
last
as
she
was
seated
in
the
carriage
but
of
course
it
will
outre
things
always
do
and
we
shall
be
disgraced
for
life
one
comfort
remains
to
me
i
am
not
in
it
king
holding
the
carriage
door
laughed
long
and
loudly
no
cousin
eunice
he
said
you
are
not
in
it
take
comfort
in
that
thought
and
the
carriage
rolled
off
mother
pepper
and
the
five
little
peppers
were
going
back
to
the
little
brown
house
really
and
truly
we
are
as
phronsie
kept
saying
over
and
over
again
with
every
revolution
of
the
in
a
crooning
fashion
and
making
it
impossible
for
king
to
shiver
in
apprehension
at
the
step
he
was
taking
were
not
two
cases
of
blankets
and
household
comforts
safely
packed
away
in
the
luggage
car
it
not
such
a
dreadful
risk
said
the
old
gentleman
gruffly
to
himself
quite
a
common
occurrence
nowadays
to
take
a
winter
outing
in
the
country
we
all
right
and
he
himself
further
by
frequent
glances
at
pepper
black
bonnet
two
seats
off
it
was
to
be
a
frolic
after
all
not
that
the
whole
party
were
to
stay
in
the
little
brown
house
o
dear
no
how
could
they
it
was
only
big
enough
for
the
peppers
so
whitney
and
her
three
boys
with
king
and
jasper
who
concealed
many
disappointed
feelings
planned
to
settle
down
in
the
old
hotel
at
hingham
and
before
anybody
imagined
they
could
reach
there
so
soon
there
they
were
at
badgertown
center
to
find
tisbett
waiting
there
on
his
as
if
he
had
not
stirred
from
it
for
five
years
sho
now
he
called
out
from
his
elevated
position
to
pepper
as
she
stepped
down
from
the
car
it
good
to
see
you
though
land
how
many
of
ye
be
there
and
is
that
phronsie
sho
now
did
you
get
my
letter
exclaimed
mother
pepper
to
henderson
who
was
pressing
up
to
grasp
her
hand
and
preparing
to
fall
on
the
young
folks
separately
the
parson
stood
just
back
biding
his
time
with
a
smile
is
it
possible
he
exclaimed
are
these
tall
boys
and
girls
the
five
little
peppers
it
ca
be
pepper
as
at
last
he
had
her
hand
you
are
imposing
on
us
and
then
the
village
people
who
had
held
back
until
their
pastor
and
his
wife
paid
their
respects
rushed
up
and
claimed
their
rights
and
it
was
high
holiday
indeed
for
badgertown
my
goodness
exclaimed
king
at
a
little
remove
and
viewing
the
scene
with
great
disfavor
this
is
worse
than
the
danger
of
taking
cold
have
they
no
sense
to
carry
on
like
this
they
so
glad
to
see
the
peppers
again
father
said
whitney
with
bright
eyes
you
took
them
away
from
all
these
good
people
you
know
it
but
fair
to
give
them
up
for
one
day
the
old
gentleman
fumed
and
fretted
however
in
a
subdued
fashion
at
last
wisely
turning
his
back
he
began
to
stalk
down
the
platform
under
pretense
of
examining
the
landscape
your
friends
will
stay
with
us
henderson
was
saying
in
a
gently
decisive
manner
the
old
parsonage
is
big
enough
she
added
with
a
laugh
oh
you
are
so
good
and
thoughtful
dear
henderson
cried
pepper
with
delight
at
the
thought
of
the
homelike
warmth
of
the
parsonage
life
awaiting
the
old
gentleman
for
whom
she
was
dreading
the
dreary
hotel
i
good
to
ourselves
declared
the
parson
wife
gaily
jasper
gave
a
shout
when
the
new
arrangement
was
declared
as
it
presently
was
by
percy
and
van
who
flung
themselves
after
him
as
he
was
seeing
to
the
luggage
with
ben
and
his
face
glowed
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
that
is
jolly
he
exclaimed
and
that
a
fact
now
ben
we
but
a
stone
throw
apart
rather
different
is
it
old
fellow
from
the
time
when
i
used
to
race
over
from
hingham
with
prince
at
my
heels
fisher
little
thin
wiry
figure
was
now
seen
advancing
upon
the
central
group
and
everybody
fell
away
to
let
him
have
his
chance
to
welcome
the
peppers
i
could
get
here
before
he
cried
his
eyes
glowing
behind
his
spectacles
i
left
a
very
sick
patient
this
is
good
he
took
them
all
in
with
a
loving
glance
but
his
hand
held
to
polly
now
i
going
to
drive
you
down
in
my
gig
he
said
to
her
at
last
will
you
come
yes
indeed
cried
polly
in
delight
as
her
mother
smiled
approval
and
she
ran
off
to
let
him
help
her
in
it
only
yesterday
since
you
took
me
to
drive
fisher
and
you
gave
me
my
stove
is
it
and
so
she
rambled
on
the
little
doctor
quite
charmed
to
hear
it
all
but
tisbett
had
a
truly
dreadful
time
placing
his
party
in
the
old
stage
as
the
townsfolk
fearful
that
so
good
a
chance
for
seeing
the
peppers
would
not
happen
during
the
three
days
stay
insisted
on
crowding
up
close
to
the
ancient
vehicle
and
getting
in
way
thereby
calling
forth
some
exclamations
from
king
that
could
not
be
regarded
as
exactly
complimentary
and
quite
sure
that
he
was
a
frightful
tyrant
they
fell
back
with
many
a
pitying
glance
at
the
pepper
family
whom
he
was
endeavoring
to
assist
into
their
places
at
last
it
was
all
accomplished
in
some
way
and
tisbett
cracked
his
whip
pepper
and
phronsie
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
bow
right
and
left
into
smiling
faces
ben
and
davie
did
the
same
over
their
heads
sang
out
joel
whom
the
stage
driver
had
taken
up
beside
him
here
we
are
off
for
the
little
brown
house
vii
old
times
again
do
let
me
look
oh
do
let
me
look
cried
polly
in
the
old
gig
and
twisting
around
she
hid
her
face
against
the
faded
green
cloth
side
i
ought
not
to
see
the
little
brown
house
before
mamsie
and
the
others
do
i
turn
down
the
lane
said
the
little
doctor
so
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
polly
could
feel
that
they
were
winding
down
the
narrow
little
road
over
toward
grandma
bascom
she
could
almost
smell
the
violets
and
anemones
under
the
carpet
of
snow
and
could
scarcely
restrain
herself
from
jumping
out
for
a
riotous
run
do
go
too
far
away
she
cried
in
sudden
alarm
we
must
be
there
by
the
time
the
stage
does
and
she
applied
her
eye
to
the
little
circular
glass
in
the
back
of
the
gig
will
it
never
come
oh
here
it
is
here
it
is
dear
dr
fisher
and
with
a
quick
flourish
around
of
the
old
horse
they
were
soon
before
the
little
brown
house
and
helping
out
the
inmates
of
the
stage
who
with
more
speed
than
grace
were
hurrying
over
the
steps
joel
was
down
before
tisbett
had
fairly
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
gate
hold
on
roared
the
stage
driver
i
do
want
you
to
break
your
neck
with
me
it
really
here
cried
phronsie
with
wide
eyes
standing
quite
still
on
a
hummock
of
frozen
snow
with
her
eyes
riveted
on
the
house
it
really
is
polly
had
raced
up
the
winding
path
and
over
the
flat
stone
to
drop
a
kiss
on
the
little
old
door
oh
oh
mamsie
do
come
she
cried
to
pepper
on
the
path
hum
i
think
jasper
you
and
i
will
let
them
alone
for
a
few
moments
said
king
who
was
still
within
the
stage
here
my
good
fellow
to
tisbett
you
say
it
all
comfortable
in
there
for
them
yes
yes
sir
said
tisbett
heartily
good
land
mis
henderson
had
her
boys
come
down
airly
this
mornin
and
make
the
fires
and
there
a
mighty
sight
of
things
to
eat
the
put
one
foot
on
the
hind
wheel
to
facilitate
conversation
and
smacked
his
lips
all
very
well
now
you
may
drive
us
down
the
road
a
bit
said
king
withdrawing
his
head
to
the
depths
of
the
lumbering
old
vehicle
again
ai
goin
in
cried
tisbett
opening
his
round
eyes
at
him
in
astonishment
get
up
and
drive
us
on
i
say
commanded
the
old
gentleman
and
cease
your
talking
which
had
the
effect
to
send
honest
tisbett
clambering
expeditiously
up
to
the
box
where
he
presently
revenged
himself
by
driving
furiously
over
all
the
hard
frozen
ruts
he
could
quickly
select
determined
not
to
stop
till
he
was
obliged
to
goodness
exclaimed
king
within
holding
to
the
strap
at
the
side
as
well
as
to
the
leather
band
of
the
swinging
seat
in
front
what
an
abominable
road
the
road
is
well
enough
said
jasper
who
could
bear
to
have
a
word
uttered
against
badgertown
it
the
fellow
driving
that
makes
it
rough
here
ca
you
be
a
little
more
careful
to
keep
the
road
he
called
thrusting
his
head
out
of
the
window
but
he
only
narrowly
escaped
losing
his
brown
traveling
cap
for
his
pains
as
the
stage
gave
a
worse
lurch
than
before
to
introduce
a
series
of
creakings
and
joltings
hitherto
unparalleled
i
can
not
endure
this
much
longer
said
old
king
growing
white
around
the
mouth
and
wishing
he
had
strength
for
the
exclamations
he
felt
inwardly
capable
of
outside
honest
tisbett
was
taking
solid
comfort
in
the
reflection
that
he
was
teaching
a
rich
city
man
that
he
could
not
approach
with
anything
less
than
respect
a
citizen
of
badgertown
ai
i
as
good
as
he
cried
tisbett
to
himself
with
an
extra
cut
to
the
off
horse
as
he
spied
a
sharp
ragged
edge
of
ice
along
the
cart
track
in
front
of
him
now
that
good
that
shake
him
he
added
cheerfully
land
but
i
hai
been
spoke
to
so
since
i
was
sassed
at
school
by
jim
bently
and
then
i
licked
him
enough
to
pay
twice
over
there
easy
the
first
thing
he
knew
one
of
the
glass
windows
was
shivered
to
fragments
the
bits
flying
off
along
the
quiet
road
to
fall
a
gleaming
shower
upon
the
snow
whoa
called
tisbett
to
his
smoking
horses
and
leaning
over
he
cried
what
the
matter
in
there
the
matter
is
said
jasper
putting
his
face
out
that
as
i
could
not
possibly
make
you
hear
my
calls
i
chose
to
break
the
window
have
the
goodness
to
let
my
father
and
me
at
once
out
of
this
vehicle
tisbett
got
down
slowly
over
the
wheel
beg
your
pardon
he
said
awkwardly
pulling
open
the
door
ai
you
goin
to
ride
back
heavens
cried
king
he
was
glad
to
find
he
could
ejaculate
so
much
as
he
tremblingly
worked
his
way
out
to
terra
firma
nothing
on
earth
would
tempt
me
to
step
foot
inside
there
again
here
is
the
money
for
your
window
said
jasper
putting
a
bill
into
the
fur
mitten
covering
tisbett
brawny
right
hand
kindly
bring
our
traps
to
the
little
brown
house
here
father
take
my
arm
and
he
ran
after
the
tall
figure
picking
its
way
along
the
frozen
road
hey
what
this
exclaimed
tisbett
looking
into
the
center
of
his
fur
mitten
five
dollars
gee
thumps
i
ai
to
take
it
after
shaking
that
old
party
almost
to
pieces
he
stood
staring
at
the
bill
in
stupid
perplexity
till
the
uneasy
movements
of
his
horses
warned
him
that
his
position
was
not
exactly
the
proper
one
for
a
who
was
on
his
box
from
morning
till
night
so
he
clambered
over
the
wheel
full
of
vexed
thoughts
and
carefully
tucked
the
bill
under
the
old
cushion
before
he
took
his
seat
ill
give
it
back
to
him
that
he
said
picking
up
the
reins
and
they
had
enough
walkin
so
they
let
me
pick
up
which
raised
him
out
of
his
depression
not
a
little
but
the
stern
faces
of
the
old
gentleman
and
the
tall
boy
smote
him
with
a
chill
long
before
he
passed
them
and
he
drove
by
silently
well
knowing
it
would
not
do
to
broach
the
subject
by
so
much
as
a
look
not
daring
to
go
near
the
little
brown
house
without
the
occupants
of
the
stage
who
had
driven
down
the
road
with
him
tisbett
drew
up
miserably
to
a
convenient
angle
and
waited
till
the
two
came
up
then
without
trusting
himself
to
think
he
sprang
to
the
ground
and
with
shame
written
all
over
his
honest
face
called
out
see
here
you
young
chap
i
want
to
speak
to
you
when
you
got
him
in
the
house
i
will
see
you
then
said
jasper
as
the
two
hurried
on
to
meet
the
peppers
rushing
out
from
the
little
brown
house
and
down
the
small
path
i
made
an
awful
mess
for
all
and
they
just
come
home
groaned
tisbett
drawing
his
fur
mitten
across
his
eyes
and
leading
his
horses
he
followed
at
a
funeral
pace
careful
not
to
stop
at
the
gate
until
the
door
was
closed
when
he
began
furiously
to
unload
a
footstep
crunching
the
snow
broke
into
the
noise
he
was
making
hoh
well
he
exclaimed
pausing
with
a
trunk
the
rack
it
a
mighty
awkward
thing
for
a
man
to
say
he
sorry
but
you
bet
i
be
as
as
my
name
john
tisbett
his
face
became
so
very
red
that
jasper
hastened
to
put
his
young
shoulder
under
the
trunk
a
movement
that
only
added
to
the
distress
it
do
pay
to
get
mad
now
i
tell
you
declared
tisbett
dumping
the
trunk
down
on
the
snow
and
then
drawing
himself
to
his
full
height
fust
place
your
pa
sassed
me
and
he
did
intend
to
cried
jasper
eagerly
and
i
apologize
for
him
if
that
what
you
want
he
laid
his
strong
right
hand
in
the
old
fur
mitten
good
land
tai
what
i
want
cried
honest
john
but
he
gripped
the
hand
nevertheless
a
fact
that
the
boy
never
forgot
i
say
i
sorry
i
shook
up
your
his
age
ought
to
have
protected
him
said
the
boy
simply
sho
that
a
fact
cried
tisbett
sinking
in
deeper
distress
but
how
is
anybody
to
remember
he
so
old
when
he
steps
so
almighty
high
as
if
he
owned
all
badgertown
say
i
think
we
shall
be
good
friends
tisbett
said
jasper
cordially
as
he
turned
to
wave
his
hand
toward
the
little
brown
house
simultaneously
the
door
opened
and
all
the
young
peppers
and
whitneys
rushed
out
to
help
in
the
delightful
unloading
it
was
well
along
in
the
afternoon
the
dusk
of
the
december
twilight
shut
down
speedily
around
the
little
brown
house
and
its
happy
occupants
but
no
one
wanted
the
candles
lighted
till
the
last
moment
oh
polly
cried
joel
who
was
prancing
as
of
old
over
the
kitchen
floor
do
you
remember
that
night
when
you
said
you
wished
you
had
two
hundred
candles
and
you
light
them
all
at
once
i
said
a
good
many
silly
things
in
those
days
said
polly
meditatively
and
smoothing
phronsie
yellow
hair
that
was
lying
across
her
lap
some
silly
ones
and
a
good
many
wise
ones
observed
mother
pepper
over
in
her
little
old
rocker
in
the
west
window
where
she
used
to
sit
sewing
up
coats
and
sacks
for
the
village
storekeeper
you
kept
us
together
many
a
time
polly
when
nothing

mamsie
protested
polly
guilty
of
contradicting
you
and
bessie
did
i
just
washed
dishes
and
swept
up
and
baked
and
brewed
and
fussed
and
stewed
finished
joel
afraid
of
being
too
sentimental
polly
was
just
lovely
in
those
days
said
davie
coming
across
the
room
to
lay
a
cool
cheek
against
her
rosy
one
i
liked
the
rainy
days
best
when
we
all
could
stay
in
the
house
and
hear
her
sing
and
tell
stories
while
she
was
working
she
was
cross
sometimes
cried
joel
determined
not
to
let
reminiscences
become
too
comfortable
she
used
to
scold
me
just
awfully
i
know
polly
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
yet
she
exclaimed
you
poor
joey
i
suppose
i
was
dreadful
you
did
catch
one
half
as
bad
scoldings
as
belonged
to
you

another
stick
in
the
stove
you
were
a
bad
lot
joe
in
those
days
and
not
over
good
in
these
cried
old
king
ensconced
in
the
snuggest
corner
in
the
seat
of
honor
the
rocker
that
comforted
phronsie
after
her
little
toe
was
hurt
there
now
my
boy
how
that
with
a
grim
smile
do
you
remember
when
the
old
stove
used
to
plague
you
polly
cried
joel
suddenly
changing
the
conversation
and
how
ben
putty
was
everlastingly
tumbling
out
hoh
hoh
and
you
two
boys
were
always
stuffing
up
the
holes
for

away

with
affectionate
glances
at
davie
and
joel
i
did
so
much

joel
honestly
dave
was
always
giving
and
such
things
repeated
king
in
astonishment

me
i
know
that
they
had
anything
in
common
with
stoves
oh
that
was
before
we
knew

said
joel
ready
in

of
any
one
else
with
the
explanation
it
was
this
stove
fisher
gave
polly
this
one
after
she
had
the
measles
but
it
was
a
lumbering
old
affair
that
was
full
of
holes
that
had
to
be
stopped
up
with
anything
we
could
get
and
leather
was
the
best
and
davie
saved
all
the
old
and
tops
he
could
find
you
know
oh
said
the
old
gentleman
wondering
if
other
revelations
would
come
to
light
about
the
early
days
of
the
peppers
is
fisher
lovely
cried
polly
with
sparkling
eyes
just
the
same
as
ever
mamsie
i
ought
to
do
something
for
him
he
is
as
good
as
gold
assented
pepper
heartily
you
done
something
i
sure
polly
the
medical
books
you
bought
out
of
your
pocket
money
and
sent
him
pleased
him
more
than
anything
you
could
give
him
but
i
want
to
do
something
now
said
polly
oh
just
think
how
good
he
was
to
us
may
we
never
forget
it
exclaimed
pepper
wiping
her
eyes
but
he
very
unwise
said
king
a
trifle
testily
not
to
take
up
with
my
offer
to
establish
him
in
the
town
a
man
like
him
could
easily
hold
a
good
practice
because
the
fellow
got
ability
oh
fisher
would
leave
badgertown
cried
all
the
peppers
in
a
bunch
and
what
would
the
poor
people
here
do
without
him
finished
polly
well
well
never
mind
he
wo
come
to
town
and
that
enough
said
the
old
gentleman
quickly
aside
from
that
he
a
sensible
chap
and
one
quite
to
my
liking
oh
polly
cried
phronsie
suddenly
and
lifting
her
head
she
fastened
her
brown
eyes
on
the
face
above
her
was
birthday
cake
good
the
flowers
were
pretty
but
the
cake
was
heavy
do
you
remember
said
polly
who
had
recovered
from
that
grief
even
yet
i
thought
it
was
just
beautiful
cried
pepper
hastily
no
one
could
have
baked
it
better
in
the
old
stove
you
had
i
sure
we
ate
it
all
up
every
crumb
we
kept
it
in
the
old
cupboard
cried
joel
rushing
over
to
the
corner
to
swing
the
door
open
and
we
never
once
peeked
mamsie
so
afraid
you
suspect
you
kept
staring
at
the
cupboard
door
all
the
evening
joe
you
know
you
did
cried
ben
you
were
just
within
a
hair
breadth
of
letting
the
whole
thing
out
ever
so
many
times
polly
and
i
had
to
drag
you
away
we
were
glad
enough
when
you
went
to
bed
i
can
tell
you
you
were
always
sending
me
off
to
bed
in
those
days
said
joel
taking
his
head
out
of
the
cupboard
to
throw
vindictive
glances
over
to
the
group
around
the
stove
i
wish
we
could
do
so
now
said
ben
and
those
two
joel
went
on
pointing
to
polly
and
ben
used
to
go
whispering
around
a
lot
of
old
secrets
that
they
would
tell
us
oh
it
was
perfectly
awful
was
it
dave
bestowing
a
small
pinch
on
that
individual
shoulder
i
liked
the
secrets
best
not
to
know
them
till
polly
and
ben
got
ready
to
tell
us
said
david
slowly
then
they
were
just
magnificent
phronsie
had
laid
her
head
back
in
the
waiting
lap
and
was
crooning
softly
to
herself
i
want
to
go
and
see
dear
good
beebe
she
said
presently
and
nice
beebe
can
i
mamsie
looking
over
at
her
to
be
sure
cried
pepper
you

child
and
who

he
pray
demanded
king
oh

keeps
the
shoe
shop
over

the
center

three
or
four
voices
and
phronsie
new
shoes
were
bought
there

and
he
gave
me
pink
and
white
said
phronsie
and
he
was
very
nice
and
i
like
him
very
much
and
beebe
gave
us
doughnuts
all
around
communicated
joel
i

but
that
i
liked
those
best
there
was
more
to
them
so
you
always
bought
your
new
shoes
of
the
beebes
asked
the
old
gentleman
a
question
that
brought
all
the
five
peppers
around
his
chair
at
once
we
did
ever
have
new
shoes
that
i
can
remember
said
joel
quickly
except
phronsie
and
once
ben
had
a
new
pair
he
had
to
because
he
was
the
oldest
you
know
oh
said
king
you
see
said
phronsie
shaking
her
head
gravely
while
she
laid
one
hand
on
his
knee
we
were
very
poor
grandpapa
dear
do
you
understand
yes

said
old
king
there

up
here
and
he
took
her
within
his
arms
no
no
you
not
going
to
talk
yet
seeing
percy
and
van
beginning
violent
efforts
to
join
in
the
conversation
let
the
peppers
have
a
chance
to
talk
over
old
times
first
see
how
good
jasper
is
to
wait
i
would
much
prefer
to
hear
the
peppers
talk
forever
said
jasper
smiling
down
on
the
two
whitneys
than
to
have
the
gates
opened
for
a
general
flood
go
on
do
polly
and
ben
and
the
rest
of
you
oh
there

so
much
said
polly
despairingly
clasping
her
hands
we
should
get
through
if
we
talked
ten
years
should
we
ben
mamsie
and
she
rushed
over
to
her
can
we
have
a
baking
time
just
as
we
used
to
in
the
old
days
oh
do
say

echoed
jasper
also
rushing
to
the
side
of
the
little
you
will
wo
you
mrs
pepper
hoh
hoh
cried
the
two
whitneys
derisively
i
thought
you
could
the
peppers
talk
forever
that
great
jasper
well
when
it
comes
to
hearing
a
proposal
for
a
baking
frolic
my
principles
are
thrown
to
the
wind
said
jasper
recklessly
why
boys
that
the
first
thing
i
remember
about
the
little
brown
house
do
say
yes
mrs
pepper
viii
some
badgertown
calls

exclaimed
grandma
bascom
opening
the
door
and
looking
in
i
never

cried
king
sociably
his
night
over
at
the
parsonage
had
been
a
most
fortunate
experiment
i
have
slept
so
finely
in
ten
years
he
confided
to
whitney
as
they
met
at
breakfast
at
the
minister
table
so
now
his
face
wreathed
with
smiles
he
repeated
his
invitation
come
in
do
bascom
we
glad
to
see
you
i
never
said
grandma
bascom
once
more
for
want
of
something
better
to
say
and
coming
close
to
the
center
of
operations
jasper
attired
in
one
of
pepper
long
aprons
which
was
fastened
in
the
style
of
the
old
days
by
the
strings
around
his
neck
was
busily
engaged
in
rolling
out
under
polly
direction
a
thin
paste
expected
presently
under
the
genial
warmth
of
the
waiting
stove
to
evolve
into
most
toothsome
cakes
ben
was
similarly
attired
and
similarly
employed
while
joel
and
david
were
in
a
sticky
state
preparing
their
dough
after
their
own
receipt
over
at
the
corner
table
their
movements
closely
followed
by
the
three
whitneys
phronsie
before
a
board
laid
across
two
chairs
was
enlightening
old
king
who
sat
by
her
into
the
mysteries
of
baking
day
do
bake
a
gingerbread
boy
he
begged
i
never
had
anything
half
so
good
as
the
one
you
sent
over
to
hingham
you
were
my
poor
sick
man
then
observed
phronsie
with
slow
even
pats
on
her
bit
of
dough
please
the
now
grandpapa
dear
to
be
sure
cried
the
old
gentleman
here
jappy
my
boy
be
so
good
as
to
hand
us
over
that
article
and
you
see
continued
phronsie
receiving
the
and
making
the
deftest
of
passes
with
it
over
the
soft
mass
i
send
you
anything
better
though
i
wanted
to
grandpapa
dear
better
cried
king
i
should
think
not
you
could
have
made
me
anything
that
pleased
me
more
had
you
tried
a
thousand
times
phronsie
never
tired
of
hearing
this
and
now
humming
a
soft
note
of
thanks
proceeded
with
her
task
declaring
that
she
would
make
the
best
gingerbread
boy
that
could
possibly
be
achieved
grandma
bascom
was
still
reiterating
i
never
and
going
slowly
from
one
group
to
another
to
inspect
operations
when
she
came
to
phronsie
she
stopped
short
raising
her
hands
in
surprise
seems
as
ef
was
only
yesterday
when
the
peppers
went
away
though
land
knows
missed
all
most
dretfully
there
sets
that
blessed
child
baking
as
big
as

of

never
have
you

more
raisins

grandma
shouted
joel
across
the
kitchen
they
were
terribly
hard
he
added
in
his
natural
voice
almost
broke
our
teeth

grandma
back
again

joel
oh
joe

ben

declared
joel
throwing
down
his
and
wiping
his
sticky
fingers
on
his
apron
just
like
old
times
so
there
i
go
over
and

said
grandma
you

along
with

looking
admiringly
up
at
the
tall
boy
so
the
two
joel
laughing
and
hopping
by
her
side
as
if
he
were
five
years
younger
disappeared
with
each
other
now
i
shall
take
his
dough
declared
dick
rushing
around
the
end
of
the
table
to
joel
deserted

van
flying
out
of
his
chair

looked
up
from
the
little
cookies
she
was
cutting

top
of
a
tin
baking
powder
box
and
their
eyes
met
i

said
van
stoutly
he
a
perfect
plague
and
always
under
foot
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
not
making
him
stand
around
polly
but
the
brown
eyes
did
not
return
to
their
task
as
polly
mechanically
stamped
another
cooky
i
only
promised
not
to
have
a
bout
with
percy

uncomfortably
and
in
the
same
breath

declared
dick
clambering

the
bigger
boy

warmed
with
the
radiant
smile
she
sent
him
dick
gave
several
vicious
thrusts
to
his
dough
and
looked
up
at

to
say
very
much
against
his
will
thank
you
and
adding
brightly
but
you
know
i
getting
big
sir

van

smile

cried
jasper
with
a
flourish
of
his
baking
apron

he
opened
the
oven
door
and
pushed
in
a
pan
of
biscuit

cried
in
delight
at
the
large
flat
cake
staring
up
at
him
from
the
board
now
says
i
i
beat
you
jappy
and
presently
the
whole
kitchen
resounded
with
a
merry
din
as
the
several
cakes
and
biscuits
were
declared
almost
ready
for
their
respective
pans
but

see
pointing
to
the
currant

moment

and
very
expressive
too
phronsie

dick
turning
around
in
his
chair
and
regarding
her
enviously
all

by

did
grandpapa
help
you
just
one
teeny
bit
to
make
the
legs
and
the
hands
no
she
made
it
all
herself
said
the
old
gentleman
with
justifiable
pride
there
phronsie
here
your
pan

it
down
before
her
with
a
you

that
perfectly
elegant
phronsie
placed
the
boy
within

pan
and
gave

many
a
loving

the
old
gentleman

her
in
mortal
dread
that
she
would
be
burned
safely
tucked
her
long
pan
into
the
warmest
corner
shut
the
door
and
gravely
consulted
the
clock
if
i
look
at
it
in
minutes
i
think
it
will
be
done
she
said
quite
brown
in
minutes
the
whole
kitchen
was
as
far
removed
from
being
the
scene
of
a
baking
exploit
as
was
possible
everything
was
cleared
away
and
set
up
primly
in
its
place
leaving
only
a
row
of
fine
little
biscuits
and
cookies
with
phronsie
gingerbread
boy
in
the
midst
to
tell
the
tale
of
what

been
going
on
outside
there
was
a
great
commotion
deacon
brown
old
wagon
stood
at
the
gate
for
the
peppers
and
their
friends
and
oh

not
the
old
horse
between

shafts
but
a
newer
and
much
livelier
beast
and
on
the
straw
laid
in
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
the
seats
being
removed
disported
all
the
merry
group
king
alone
having
the
dignity
of
a
chair
deacon
brown
delighted
with
his
scheme
of
bringing
the
wagon
over
as
a
surprise
for
the
peppers
to
take
a
drive
in

on
the
side
of

being
left
behind
he
wanted
to
see
beebe
she
managed
to
say
and
dear
beebe
oh

so
king
made
them
hand
her
up
to
him
and
at
the
risk
of
their
both
rolling
out
he
held
her
in
his
lap
until
the
wagon
stopping
at
the
door
of
grandma
bascom
cottage
brought
joel
bounding
out
with
a
whoop
jolly
where
you
get
that
and
where

going
all
in
one
breath
as

joel

but
nothing

details
could
they
extract
from
him
and
so
at
last
they
gave
it
up
and
lent
their
attention
to
the
various
things
to
be
seen
as
the
wagon
spun
along
and
so
over
and
through
the
town
and
to
the
very
door
of
the
little
and
there
to
be
sure
was
beebe
the
same
as
ever
to
welcome
them
and
joel
found
to
his
immense
satisfaction
that
the
stone
pot
was
as
full
of
sugary
doughnuts
as
in
the
old
days
and
phronsie
had
her
pink
and
white
sticks
and
beebe
and
over
them
all
and
could
bear
to
let
them
go
when
at
last
it
was
time
to
say
and
at
last
they
all
climbed
into
the
old
wagon
and
were
off
again
on
their
round
of
visits
it
was
not
till
the
gray
dusk
of
the
winter
afternoon
settled
down
unmistakably
so
that
no
one
could
beg
to
stay
out
longer
that
they
turned
deacon
brown
horse
toward
the
little
brown
house
it
going
to
snow
i
think
observed
jasper
squinting
up
at
the
leaden
sky
is
it
father
whoop
exclaimed
joel
then
we
will
have
sport
i
tell
you
it

looks
like
it
said
old
king
wrapping
his
coat
closer
phronsie
are
you
sure
you
are
warm
enough
yes
grandpapa
dear
she
answered
curling
up
deeper
in
the
straw
at
his
feet
do
you
remember
how
you
would
carry
the
shoes
home
with
you
phronsie
cried
polly
and
then
away
they
rushed
again
into
oh
do
you
remember
this
and
you
have
forgotten
that
jasper
as
wildly
reminiscent
now
as
the
others
for
had
he
almost
as
good
as
lived
at
the
little
brown
house
pray
tell
so
the
whitneys
looked
curiously
on
without
a
chance
to
be
heard
in
all
the
merry
chatter
and
then
they
drew
up
at
the
gate
of
the
parsonage
where
they
were
all
to
have
supper
when
phronsie
woke
up
in
the
big
bed
by
the
side
of
her
mother
the
next
morning
polly
was
standing
over
her
and
looking
down
into
her
face
oh
phronsie
she
exclaimed
in
great
glee

ground
is
all
covered
with
snow

phronsie
her
brown
eyes
flying
wide
open
do
give
me
my
shoes
and
stockings
polly

be
dressed
in
just
one
minute
and
thereupon
ensued
a
merry
scramble
as
she
tumbled
out
of
the
big
bed
and
commenced
operations
polly
running
out
to
help
mamsie
get
the
breakfast
mush

good
now

do
have
to
eat
it
cried
joel
as
they
all
at
last
sat
around
the
board

good
then
said
pepper
her
black
eyes
roving
over
the
faces
before
her
how
funny
cried
percy
whitney
who
had
run
over
from
the
parsonage
to
breakfast

yellow
stuff

he
took
up
a
spoonful
of
it
gingerly

like
it
percy

try
to
eat
it
i
make
you
a
slice
of

springing
out
of
her
chair

just
one
moment

dick
bounding
in
in
time
to
catch
the
last
words
mamma

came
to
breakfast
from
what
the
peppers

going
to
eat
i
like
the
yellow
stuff

do
and
he
slid
into
a
chair
and
passed
his
plate
to
pepper
so
you
shall
dicky
she
said
hastily
and
you
will
never
taste
sweeter
food
than
this
giving
him
a
generous
spoonful
grandpapa

eating
ham
and
fried
eggs
over
at
the
minister
house
contributed
dick
after
satisfying
his
hunger
a
bit
ham
and
fried
eggs
exclaimed
mother
pepper
aghast
why
he
never
touches
them
you
must
be
mistaken
my
boy
no
i
not
said
dick
obstinately
the
minister
wife
said
it
was
and
she
asked
me
if

would
have
some
and
i
said
i
was
going
over
to
the
peppers
to
breakfast
i
rather

of
theirs
and
grandpapa
said
it
was
good

ham
and
fried
eggs

and
he
took
it
twice
he
did
mrs
pepper
took
it
twice
she
repeated
faintly
with
troubled
visions
of
the
future
well
well
the
mischief
is
done
now
so
there
is
no
use
in
talking
about
it
but
i
worried
all
the
same
hurry
up
percy
called
joel
across
the
table
and
do
dawdle
so
we
going
to
make
a
double
ripper
four
yards
long
to
go
down
that
hill
there
he
laid
down
his
spoon
to
point
out
the
window
at
a
distant
slope
percy
shivered
but
recalling
himself
in
time
said
splendid
and
addressed
himself
with
difficulty
to
his
mush
well
you
never
be
through
at
that
speed
declared
joel
see
eaten
three
saucerfuls
and
he
handed
his
plate
up
and
now
for
the
fourth
mamsie
oh
baked
potatoes
cried
ben
rolling
one
around
in
his
hand
before
he
took
off
its
crackling
skin
were
they
good
though
with
a
little
salt
i
tell
you
they
helped
us
to
chop
wood
in
the
old
times
i
really
think
i
shall
have
to
try
one
said
percy
who
deeply
to
his
regret
was
obliged
to
confess
that
indian
meal
mush
had
few
charms
for
his
palate
there
real
milk
in
my
mug
now
cried
phronsie
with
long
deep
draughts
polly
did
i
ever
have
anything
but
in
the
little
brown
house
ever
polly
polly
was
saved
from
answering
by
a
stamping
of
snowy
boots
on
the
flat
doorstone
hurrah
there
cried
van
rushing
in
followed
by
jasper
hoh
you
slow
people
in
the
little
brown
house
come
on
for
the
double
ripper
ix
a
sudden
blow
mamsie
cried
polly
suddenly
and
resting
her
hands
on
her
knees
as
she
sat
on
the
floor
before
the
stove
do
you
suppose
there
is
any
one
poor
enough
in
badgertown
to
need
the
little
brown
house
when
we
lock
it
up
not
a
soul
replied
pepper
quickly
no
more
than
there
was
when
we
first
locked
it
up
five
years
ago
polly
been
all
over
that
with
the
parson
last
evening
and
he
says
there
is
a
new
family
in
the
place
and
all
the
old
ones
have
their
homes
the
same
as
ever
so
we
can
turn
the
key
and
leave
it
with
a
clear
conscience
polly
drew
a
long
breath
of
delight
and
gazed
long
at
the
face
of
the
stove
that
seemed
to
crackle
out
an
answering
note
of
joy
as
the
wood
snapped
merrily
then
she
slowly
looked
around
the
kitchen
it
so
perfectly
lovely
mamsie
she
broke
out
at
length
to
see
the
dear
old
things
and
to
know
that
they
are
waiting
here
for
us
to
come
back
whenever
we
want
to
and
to
think
it
is
wicked
not
to
have
them
used
because
everybody
has
all
they
need
oh
it
so
delicious
to
think
they
can
be
left
to
themselves
she
folded
her
hands
now
across
her
knees
and
drew
another
long
breath
of
content
phronsie
stole
out
of
the
bedroom
and
came
slowly
up
to
her
side
pausing
a
bit
on
the
way
to
look
into
polly
absorbed
face
i
do
think
mamsie
she
said
quietly
that
people
ought
to
be
so
very
good
who
never
had
a
little
brown
house
never
in
all
their
lives
oh
yes
they
had
child
said
pepper
briskly
places
make
any
difference
it
people
duty
to
be
good
wherever
they
are
but
phronsie
face
expressed
great
incredulity
i
always
going
to
live
here
when
i
am
a
big
woman
she
declared
slowly
gazing
around
the
kitchen
and
i
shall
never
never
go
out
of
badgertown
oh
phronsie
exclaimed
polly
turning
around
in
dismay
why
you
could
do
that
just
think
child
whatever
in
the
world
would
grandpapa
do
or
any
of
us
pray
tell
grandpapa
would
come
here
declared
phronsie
decidedly
and
shaking
her
yellow
head
to
enforce
her
statement
of
course
grandpapa
would
come
here
polly
we
could
live
without
him
that
it
said
polly
with
a
corresponding
shake
of
her
brown
head
of
course
we
could
live
without
grandpapa
and
just
as
he
could
leave
his
own
dear
home
he
never
would
be
happy
phronsie
to
do
that
phronsie
took
a
step
or
two
into
the
sunshine
lying
on
the
middle
of
the
old
kitchen
floor
then
i
rather
not
come
polly
she
said
but
she
sighed
and
polly
was
just
about
saying
we
run
down
now
and
then
perhaps
phronsie
as
we
have
done
now
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
suddenly
and
joel
burst
in
his
face
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
working
fearfully
oh
polly
you
must
tell
whitney
i
ca
polly
sprang
to
her
feet
pepper
who
had
just
stepped
into
the
pantry
was
saying
i
think
polly
i
make
some
apple
dumplings
the
boys
like
them
so
much
what
is
it
joe
cried
polly
hoarsely
and
standing
quite
still
phronsie
with
wide
eyes
went
up
and
took
the
boy
cold
hand
and
gazed
into
his
face
as
he
leaned
against
the
door
dick
groaned
joel
oh
oh
i
ca
bear
it
and
covering
his
face
with
one
hand
he
would
have
pulled
the
other
from
phronsie
warm
little
palm
but
she
held
it
fast
tell
me
at
once
joe
commanded
polly
hush
mother
but
pepper
was
already
out
of
the
pantry
joel
said
pepper
whatever
it
is
tell
us
immediately
the
look
in
her
black
eyes
forced
him
to
gasp
in
one
breath
dick
fell
off
the
double
ripper
and
both
of
his
legs
are
broken
may
be
not
he
added
in
a
loud
scream
phronsie
still
held
the
boy
hand
he
was
conscious
of
it
and
that
she
uttered
no
word
and
then
he
knew
no
more
leave
him
to
me
polly
said
pepper
through
drawn
lips
and
then
do
you
run
as
you
have
never
run
before
to
the
parsonage
oh
if
they
should
bring
him
there
before
the
mother
hears
phronsie
dropped
the
hand
she
held
and
running
on
unsteady
little
feet
into
the
bedroom
came
back
with
polly
hood
and
coat
let
me
go
cried
polly
wildly
rushing
away
from
the
detaining
hand
to
the
door
i
do
want
those
things
on
let
me
go
phronsie
you
be
cold
said
phronsie
with
all
her
care
her
little
white
lips
were
quivering
as
she
held
out
the
things
please
polly
she
said
piteously
the
child
is
right
put
them
on
commanded
pepper
for
one
instant
taking
her
thought
from
her
boy
and
polly
obeyed
and
was
gone
in
the
parsonage
best
room
sat
whitney
her
was
none
of
the
easiest
being
a
affair
its
cushion
very
much
elevated
in
the
world
just
where
it
should
have
been
depressed
so
that
one
was
in
constant
danger
of
slipping
off
its
surface
moreover
the
arms
and
back
of
the
chair
were
covered
with
indescribable
arrangements
made
and
presented
by
loving
parishioners
and
demanding
unceasing
attention
from
the
occupant
but
the
chair
was
drawn
up
in
the
sunshine
pouring
into
the
window
and
whitney
thoughts
were
sunny
too
for
she
smiled
now
and
then
as
she
drew
her
needle
busily
in
and
out
through
the
bright
wools
how
restful
it
all
is
here
and
so
quaint
and
simple
she
glanced
up
now
to
the
mantel
with
its
wealth
of
daguerreotypes
and
surprising
collection
of
dried
leaves
in
tall
china
vases
and
over
the
walls
adorned
with
framed
pictures
to
the
center
table
loaded
with
annuals
and
one
or
two
volumes
of
english
poetry
and
then
her
gaze
took
in
the
little
paths
the
winter
sunshine
was
making
for
itself
along
the
red
and
green
ingrain
carpet
i
am
so
glad
father
thought
to
bring
us
all
dear
father
it
is
making
a
new
man
of
him
this
winter
frolic
why
she
was
looking
out
of
the
window
now
and
her
hands
fell
to
her
lap
as
polly
pepper
came
running
breathlessly
down
the
village
street
her
hood
untied
and
the
coat
grasped
with
one
hand
and
held
together
across
her
breast
but
it
was
the
face
that
terrified
whitney
and
hurrying
out
of
her
chair
she
ran
out
to
the
veranda
as
the
girl
rushed
through
the
gateway
polly
child
cried
whitney
seizing
her
with
loving
arms
and
drawing
her
on
the
steps
oh
what
is
it
dear
polly
lips
moved
but
no
words
came
oh
at
last
do
hate
us
for
bringing
you
to
the
little
brown
house
why
did
we
come
and
convulsively
she
threw
her
young
arms
around
the
kind
neck
oh
auntie
dicky
is
hurt
but
we
do
know
how
much
his
legs
joel
says
but
it
may
not
be
as
bad
as
we
think
dear
auntie
whitney
trembled
so
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
around
them
streamed
the
same
winter
sunshine
that
had
been
so
bright
a
moment
since
how
long
ago
it
seemed
and
out
of
gathering
clouds
in
her
heart
she
was
saying
polly
dear
god
is
good
we
will
trust
him
she
did
not
know
her
own
voice
nor
realize
when
polly
led
her
mercifully
within
as
a
farmer
wagon
came
slowly
down
the
street
to
stop
at
the
parsonage
gate
nor
even
when
dick
was
brought
in
white
and
still
could
she
think
of
him
as
her
boy
it
was
some
other
little
figure
and
she
must
go
and
help
them
care
for
him
her
boy
would
come
bounding
in
presently
happy
and
ruddy
with
a
kiss
for
mamma
and
a
world
of
happy
nonsense
just
as
usual
it
was
only
when
henderson
came
in
and
took
her
hand
to
lead
her
into
the
next
room
that
it
all
came
to
her
oh
dick
and
she
sprang
to
the
side
of
the
sofa
where
he
lay
my
child
my
child
and
then
came
fisher
and
the
truth
was
known
one
of
dick
legs
was
broken
below
the
knee
the
other
badly
bruised
only
jasper
and
the
mother
remained
in
the
room
while
the
little
doctor
set
the
limb
and
after
what
seemed
an
age
to
the
watchers
the
boy
came
out
he
bore
it
like
a
trojan
declared
jasper
wiping
his
forehead
i
tell
you
dick
our
hero
after
this
now
i
should
like
to
know
how
all
this
happened
demanded
king
the
old
gentleman
had
remained
at
the
parsonage
to
get
a
good
morning
nap
while
the
snow
frolic
was
in
progress
and
he
had
been
awakened
by
the
unusual
bustle
below
stairs
in
time
to
hear
the
welcome
news
that
dicky
was
all
right
since
fisher
was
taking
care
of
him
he
now
presented
himself
in
his
with
his
sleeping
cap
awry
over
a
face
in
which
anger
distress
and
impatience
strove
for
the
mastery
speak
up
my
boy
to
jasper
and
tell
us
what
you
know
about
it
well
the
first
thing
i
knew
of
any
danger
ahead
said
jasper
was
hearing
dick
sing
out
up
i
supposed
the
double
ripper
all
right
did
you
ben
yes
said
ben
sturdily
and
it
was
all
right
just
exactly
as
we
used
to
make
them
we
boys
there
was
a
weak
spot
anywhere
in
her
sir
who
was
steering
demanded
old
king
almost
fiercely
i
was
said
van
beginning
boldly
enough
to
let
his
voice
die
out
in
a
tremulous
effort
humph
humph
responded
king
grimly
a
bad
business
shaking
his
head
van
would
began
percy
but
his
eye
meeting
polly
he
added
none
of
us
done
any
better
i
do
believe
sir
than
van
van
was
now
choking
so
badly
that
the
greatest
kindness
seemed
to
be
not
to
look
at
him
accordingly
the
little
company
turned
their
eyes
away
and
regarded
each
other
instead
well
so
dick
rolled
off
proceeded
the
old
gentleman
oh
no
he
did
said
all
three
boys
together
he
stuck
fast
to
the
double
ripper
we
ran
into
a
tree
and
dick
was
pitched
off
but
honestly
and
truly
father
said
jasper
i
do
not
think
that
it
was
the
fault
of
the
steerer
indeed
it
was
not
declared
ben
stoutly
there
was
an
ugly
little
gully
that
we
had
seen
under
the
snow
we
been
down
four
or
five
times
all
right
but
only
missed
it
by
a
this
time
the
ripper
struck
into
it
i
suppose
dick
felt
it
bump
as
it
was
on
his
side
and
sang
out
and
as
quick
as
lightning
we
were
against
that
tree
it
was
as
much
my
fault
as
any
one
and
more
because
i
ought
to
have
known
that
old
hill
thoroughly
i
share
the
blame
ben
broke
in
jasper
old
fellow
if
you
pitch
into
yourself
you
have
to
knock
me
over
too
come
here
vanny
said
old
king
holding
out
his
hand
why
you
need
be
afraid
my
boy
aghast
at
the
tears
that
no
power
on
earth
could
keep
back
now
all
leave
the
room
please
where
polly
asked
ben
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
she
run
home
said
david
i
guess
she
is
here
and
that
where
i
must
be
too
cried
ben
bounding
off
when
van
was
next
seen
he
was
with
old
king
and
wearing
all
signs
of
having
received
his
full
share
of
comfort
phronsie
just
tying
on
her
little
hood
to
go
down
to
the
parsonage
to
ask
after
dicky
looked
out
of
the
window
to
exclaim
in
pleased
surprise
why
here
comes
dear
grandpapa
and
then
she
rushed
out
to
meet
him
here
my
little
girl
cried
the
old
gentleman
opening
his
arms
when
she
immediately
ran
into
them
now
we
all
right
is
dicky
all
right
asked
phronsie
anxiously
as
she
fell
into
step
by
his
side
yes
indeed
as
well
as
a
youngster
can
be
who
broken
his
leg
phronsie
shivered
but
then
that
nothing
king
hastened
to
add
i
broke
my
own
when
i
was
a
small
shaver
no
bigger
than
dick
and
i
was
none
the
worse
for
it
boys
always
have
some
such
trifling
mishaps
phronsie
ben
never
broke
his
leg
nor
joel
nor
davie
said
phronsie
must
they
yet
grandpapa
o
dear
no
declared
king
hastily
that
is
necessary
i
only
meant
they
must
have
something
now
you
see
ben
had
the
measles
you
know
yes
he
did
said
phronsie
quite
relieved
to
think
that
this
trial
could
take
the
place
of
the
usual
episode
in
a
career
and
so
did
joel
and
davie
all
of
them
grandpapa
dear
exactly
well
and
then
ben
had
to
work
hard
and
joel
and
davie
too
for
that
matter
so
you
see
it
was
as
essential
that
they
should
break
their
legs
child
but
jasper
and
percy
and
van
do
have
to
work
hard
oh
i
do
want
them
to
break
their
legs
said
phronsie
in
a
worried
tone
you
think
they
will
grandpapa
dear
do
you
please
say
they
wo
i
do
think
there
is
the
least
danger
of
it
said
king
especially
as
i
shall
put
an
end
to
this
business
though
not
because
this
upset
was
anybody
fault
remember
that
phronsie
van
head
which
had
dropped
a
bit
at
the
last
words
came
up
proudly
van
here
has
acted
nobly
he
put
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
and
would
have
saved
dicky
if
he
could
it
was
a
pure
accident
that
nobody
could
help
except
by
keeping
off
from
the
abominable
thing
well
here
we
are
at
the
little
brown
house
and
there
your
mother
phronsie
waiting
for
us
in
the
doorway
halloo
cried
van
rushing
over
the
flat
stone
and
past
pepper
where
joel
oh
here
you
old
chap
well
pepper
said
the
old
gentleman
coming
up
to
the
step
phronsie
hanging
to
his
hand
this
looks
like
starting
for
town
does
it
oh
what
shall
we
do
sir
cried
pepper
in
distress
to
think
you
have
come
down
here
in
the
goodness
of
your
heart
to
be
met
with
such
an
accident
as
this
what
shall
we
do
she
repeated
goodness
of
my
heart
repeated
king
nevertheless
well
pleased
at
the
tribute
i
had
as
much
pleasure
out
of
it
all
as
you
or
the
young
people
i
want
you
to
realize
that
so
does
any
one
who
does
a
kind
act
replied
pepper
wiping
her
eyes
well
sir
now
how
shall
we
manage
about
going
back
that
remains
to
be
seen
said
king
slowly
and
he
took
a
long
look
at
the
winter
sky
and
the
distant
landscape
before
he
ventured
more
it
very
much
looks
as
if
we
all
should
remain
for
a
few
days
to
see
how
dick
is
to
get
on
all
but
the
four
boys
they
must
pack
off
to
school
and
then
probably
whitney
will
stay
over
with
the
boy
till
he
can
be
moved
fisher
will
do
the
right
thing
by
him
oh
everything
is
all
right
mrs
pepper
pepper
sighed
and
led
the
way
into
the
house
she
knew
in
spite
of
the
reassuring
words
that
the
extreme
limit
of
the
outing
ought
to
be
passed
on
the
morrow
x
the
party
separates
to
the
little
brown
house
joel
and
david
percy
and
van
sang
out
in
doleful
chorus
from
the
old
stage
coach
two
of
the
boys
on
the
seat
shared
by
john
tisbett
the
other
two
within
as
companions
to
pepper
and
jasper
who
were
going
home
to
start
the
quartette
off
to
school
ben
and
i
will
take
good
care
of
everything
mamsie
said
polly
for
the
fiftieth
time
and
climbing
up
on
the
steps
to
tuck
the
traveling
shawl
closer
thereupon
phronsie
climbed
up
too
to
do
the
same
thing
do
you
worry
we
take
care
of
things
she
echoed
i
sha
worry
said
pepper
in
a
bright
assured
way
mother
knows
you
both
do
just
right
and
phronsie
be
a
good
girl
too
with
a
long
look
into
the
bright
eyes
peering
over
the
window
casing
of
the
old
coach
i
try
said
phronsie
mamsie
and
she
tried
to
stand
on
tiptoe
to
reach
her
mouth
up
goodness
me
cried
polly
you
nearly
tumbled
off
the
steps
throw
her
a
kiss
phronsie
mamsie
catch
it
if
that
child
wants
to
kiss
her
ma
agen
she
shall
do
it
declared
tisbett
and
throwing
down
the
reins
he
sprang
to
the
ground
seized
phronsie
and
swung
her
lightly
over
the
window
edge
there
you
be
went
through
just
like
a
bird
and
there
she
was
sure
enough
in
pepper
lap
i
should
like
to
go
with
you
phronsie
was
whispering
under
pepper
bonnet
strings
mamsie
i
should
oh
no
phronsie
pepper
made
haste
to
whisper
back
you
must
stay
with
polly
why
what
would
she
ever
do
without
you
be
good
girl
phronsie
you
all
coming
home
except
auntie
and
dick
in
a
few
days
phronsie
cast
one
look
at
polly
she
said
slowly
take
me
out
now
holding
her
arms
towards
tisbett
here
you
be
exclaimed
tisbett
merrily
reversing
the
process
and
setting
her
carefully
on
the
ground
now
says
i
up
i
goes
his
foot
on
the
wheel
to
spring
to
the
box
stay
a
peremptory
hand
was
laid
on
his
shaggy
coat
sleeve
and
he
turned
to
face
old
king
when
i
meet
a
man
who
can
do
such
a
kind
thing
it
is
worth
my
while
to
say
that
i
trust
no
words
of
mine
gave
offense
bless
you
man
added
the
old
gentleman
abruptly
changing
the
tone
of
his
address
as
well
as
its
form
it
my
way
that
all
john
tisbett
had
no
words
to
offer
but
remained
his
foot
on
the
wheel
stupidly
staring
up
at
the
handsome
old
face
we
shall
be
late
for
the
train
called
jasper
within
the
coach
if
you
do
start
get
up
do
cried
joel
who
had
seized
the
reins
or
i
drive
off
without
you
tisbett
which
had
the
effect
to
carry
honest
john
briskly
up
to
his
place
when
there
he
took
off
his
fur
cap
without
a
word
and
bowed
to
king
cracked
his
whip
and
they
were
off
leaving
the
four
on
the
little
gazing
after
them
till
the
coach
was
only
a
speck
in
the
distance
mamma
dear
said
dick
one
afternoon
three
weeks
later
the
little
brown
house

been
closed
a
fortnight
and
all
the
rest
of
the
party
back
in
town
when

week
said
whitney
brightly
the
doctor
thinks
if
all
goes
well

can
be
moved
from
here
dick
leaned
back
in
the
big
chair
mamma
he
said
your
cheeks

not
quite
so
round
but

think

a
great

nicer
mamma
than

so
long
for
you
as
i
feared

dick
promptly
and
burrowing
deeper
into
the
it
just
flown
mamma

whitney
fervently
dicky

like
to

secret
she
asked
suddenly
the
boy
eyes
sparkled
would
i
mamma
he
cried
springing
forward
in
the
chair
ugh
take
care

warned
his
mother

remember
the
poor
leg
dick
made
a
grimace
but
otherwise
took
the
pain
pluckily
tell
me
do
mamma
he
begged
the
secret
yes
i
thought
it
would
be
a
pleasant
thing
for
you
to
have
it
to
think
of
darling
while
you
are
getting
well
dicky
papa

coming
home
soon
right
away
shouted
dick
so
lustily
that
henderson
popped
her
head
in
the
door
oh

your
pardon
she
said
i
thought
you
wanted
something

it
lovely
cried
whitney
to
have
a
boy
who
is
beginning
to
find
his
lungs
indeed
it
is
cried
the
parson
wife
laughing
i
always
picked
up
heart
when
my
children
were
able
to
scream
it
good
to
hear
you
dicky
as
she
closed
the
door
is
he
is
he
is
he
cried
dick
in
a
spasm
of
excitement
coming
right
straight
away
mamma
next
week
said
mamma
with
happy
eyes
he
sails
in
the
servia
next
week
dicky
my
boy
we
will
see
papa
and
here
is
the
best
part
of
the
secret
listen
it
has
all
been
arranged
that
duyckink
shall
live
in
liverpool
so
that
papa
will
not
have
to
go
across
any
more
but
he
can
stay
at
home
with
us
oh
dicky
that
oh
dicky
told
volumes
to
the
boy
heart
mamma
he
said
at
last
is
it
good
that
god
did
give
boys
and
girls
to
duyckink
because
you
see
if
he
had
why
then
duyckink
would
like
to
live
over
there
duyckink
might
not
have
felt
as
your
father
does
dicky
dear
about
having
his
children
educated
at
home
and
duyckink
wants
to
go
to
england
she
has
any
father
as
i
have
dicky
dear
who
clings
to
the
old
home
only
i
wish
god
had
made
duyckink
and
duyckink
a
little
sooner
said
dick
reflectively
i
mean
made
them
want
to
go
to
england
sooner
do
you
mamma
i
suppose
we
ought
not
to
wish
that
said
his
mother
with
a
smile
for
perhaps
we
needed
to
be
taught
to
be
patient
only
now
dicky
just
think
we
can
actually
have
papa
live
at
home
with
us
your
cheeks
are
pink
now
observed
dick
just
the
very
pink
they
used
to
be
mamma
whitney
ran
to
the
hanging
in
its
frame
between
the
low
windows
and
peered
in
do
i
look
just
as
i
did
when
papa
went
away
six
months
ago
dicky
she
asked
anxiously
yes
said
dick
just
like
that
only
a
great
deal
nicer
he
added
enthusiastically
his
mother
laughed
and
pulled
at
a
bright
wave
on
her
forehead
dodging
a
bit
to
avoid
a
long
crack
running
across
the
front
here
dr
fisher
shouted
dick
suddenly
now
you
old
fellow
you
and
shaking
his
small
fist
at
his
lame
leg
you
got
to
get
well
i
tell
you
i
wo
wait
much
longer
sir
and
as
the
doctor
came
in
i
a
secret
well
then
you
would
better
keep
it
said
fisher
good
morning
to
whitney
our
young
man
here
is
getting
ahead
pretty
fast
i
should
think
how
the
leg
dicky
sitting
down
by
him
the
leg
is
all
right
cried
dick
i
going
to
step
on
it
trying
to
get
out
of
the
chair
dicky
cried
his
mother
in
alarm
softly
softly
now
young
man
said
fisher
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
cure
that
leg
of
yours
and
make
it
as
good
as
the
other
one
do
you
why
of
course
replied
dick
that
what
you
are
a
doctor
for
well
i
wo
agree
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
said
the
little
doctor
coolly
if
you
do
do
your
part
do
you
know
what
patience
means
i
been
patient
exclaimed
dick
in
a
dudgeon
forever
and
ever
so
many
weeks
and
now
papa
is
coming
home
and
i
and
then
he
realized
what
he
had
done
and
he
turned
quite
pale
and
looked
at
his
mother
her
face
gave
no
sign
but
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
feeling
disgraced
for
life
and
ready
to
keep
quiet
forever
and
he
was
so
good
while
fisher
was
attending
to
his
leg
that
when
he
was
through
the
little
doctor
turned
to
him
approvingly
well
sir
i
think
that
i
can
promise
that
you
can
go
home
saturday
you
improved
beyond
my
expectation
but
dick
did
hurrah
nor
even
smile
dicky
said
whitney
smiling
into
his
downcast
face
how
glad
we
are
to
hear
that
just
think
good
fisher
says
we
may
go
next
saturday
i
glad
mumbled
dick
in
a
forlorn
little
voice
and
till
after
the
door
closed
on
the
retreating
form
of
the
doctor
it
was
all
that
could
be
gotten
out
of
him
then
he
turned
and
put
out
both
arms
to
his
mother
i
did
mean
i
did
mean
i
truly
did
mean
to
tell
mamma
he
sobbed
as
she
clasped
him
closely
i
know
you
did
dear
she
soothed
him
it
has
really
done
no
harm
papa
did
want
the
home
people
to
know
as
he
wants
to
surprise
them
but
it
was
a
secret
said
dick
between
his
tears
feeling
as
if
he
had
lost
a
precious
treasure
entrusted
to
him
oh
mamma
i
really
did
mean
to
let
it
go
mamma
feels
quite
sure
of
that
said
whitney
gently
you
are
right
dicky
in
feeling
sorry
and
ashamed
because
anything
given
to
you
to
keep
is
not
your
own
but
belongs
to
another
but
my
boy
the
next
duty
is
to
keep
back
those
tears
all
this
is
hurting
your
leg
dick
struggled
manfully
but
still
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
at
last
he
said
raising
his
head
you
would
much
better
let
me
have
my
cry
out
mamma
it
and
it
hurts
to
send
it
back
well
i
do
think
so
said
whitney
with
a
laugh
i
often
wanted
to
have
a
cry
out
as
you
call
it
but
that
weak
dicky
and
should
be
stopped
for
the
more
one
cries
the
more
one
wants
to
you
often
wanted
to
have
a
cry
out
repeated
dick
in
such
amazement
that
every
tear
just
getting
ready
to
show
itself
immediately
rushed
back
again
why
you
have
anything
to
cry
for
mamma
indeed
i
have
she
declared
often
and
often
i
do
many
things
that
i
ought
not
to
do
oh
never
never
cried
dick
clutching
her
around
the
neck
to
the
detriment
of
her
wrapper
my
sweetest
dearingest
mamma
is
ever
and
always
just
right
indeed
dick
said
whitney
earnestly
the
longer
i
live
i
find
that
every
day
i
have
something
to
be
sorry
for
in
myself
but
god
you
know
is
good
she
whispered
softly
dick
was
silent
and
then
when
papa
goes
continued
whitney
why
then
my
boy
it
is
very
hard
not
to
cry
here
was
something
that
the
boy
could
grasp
and
he
seized
it
with
avidity
and
you
stop
crying
for
us
he
cried
i
know
now
why
you
always
put
on
your
prettiest
gown
and
play
games
with
us
the
evening
after
papa
goes
i
know
now
here
are
three
letters
cried
the
parson
hurrying
in
and
tossing
them
over
to
the
boy
and
polly
pepper
has
written
to
me
too
dick
screamed
with
delight
two
for
me
one
from
ben
and
one
from
grandpapa
and
mine
is
from
phronsie
said
whitney
seizing
an
epistle
carefully
printed
in
blue
crayon
but
although
there
were
three
letters
from
home
none
of
them
carried
the
news
of
what
was
going
on
there
none
of
them
breathed
a
syllable
that
cousin
eunice
chatterton
was
ill
with
a
low
fever
aggravated
by
nervous
prostration
and
that
pepper
and
polly
were
having
a
pretty
hard
time
of
it
on
the
contrary
every
bit
of
news
was
of
the
cheeriest
nature
jasper
tucked
on
a
postscript
to
his
father
letter
in
which
he
gave
the
latest
bulletin
of
his
school
life
and
polly
did
the
same
thing
to
ben
letter
even
phronsie
went
into
a
long
detail
concerning
the
new
developments
of
a
wonderful
kitten
she
had
left
at
home
to
take
her
visit
to
badgertown
so
the
two
recipients
never
missed
the
lack
of
information
in
regard
to
the
household
life
from
which
they
were
shut
out
only
once
whitney
said
thoughtfully
as
she
folded
her
letter
and
slipped
it
back
into
its
envelope
they
do
speak
of
chatterton
i
presume
she
has
changed
her
plans
and
is
going
to
remain
longer
at
her
nephew
i
hope
she
live
there
always
declared
dick
looking
up
savagely
from
ben
letter
what
an
old
guy
she
is
mamma
dick
dick
said
his
mother
reprovingly
she
is
our
guest
you
know
not
if
she
is
at
her
nephew
said
dick
triumphantly
turning
back
to
his
letter
polly
at
this
identical
minute
was
slowly
ascending
the
stairs
a
tray
in
one
hand
the
contents
of
which
she
was
anxiously
regarding
on
the
way
i
do
hope
it
is
right
now
she
said
and
presently
knocked
at
chatterton
door
come
in
said
that
lady
voice
fretfully
and
do
close
the
door
before
polly
and
her
tray
were
well
within
polly
shut
the
door
gently
and
approached
the
bedside
i
am
so
faint
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
take
any
said
chatterton
whether
it
was
her
white
cashmere
and
her
delicate
lace
cap
that
made
her
face
against
the
pillows
seem
wan
and
white
polly
did
not
know
but
it
struck
her
that
she
looked
more
ill
than
usual
and
she
said
earnestly
i
am
so
sorry
i
was
quicker
there
is
no
call
for
an
apology
from
you
said
chatterton
coldly
set
the
tray
down
on
the
table
and
get
a
basin
of
water
i
need
to
be
bathed
polly
stood
quite
still
even
forgetting
to
deposit
the
tray
set
the
tray
down
i
told
you
repeated
chatterton
sharply
and
then
get
the
basin
of
water
i
will
call
hortense
said
polly
quietly
placing
the
tray
as
desired
hortense
has
gone
to
the
apothecary
said
chatterton
and
i
will
not
have
one
of
the
other
maids
they
are
too
insufferable
and
indeed
polly
knew
that
it
would
be
small
use
to
summon
one
of
them
as
martha
the
most
obliging
had
airily
tossed
her
head
when
asked
to
do
some
little
service
for
the
sick
woman
that
very
morning
declaring
i
will
never
lift
another
finger
for
that
madame
chatterton
my
neck
aches
and
my
side
and
my
head
said
chatterton
irritably
why
do
you
not
do
as
i
bid
you
for
one
long
instant
polly
hesitated
then
she
turned
to
rush
from
the
room
a
flood
of
angry
bitter
feelings
surging
through
her
heart
more
at
the
insufferable
tone
and
manner
than
at
what
she
was
bidden
to
do
only
turned
and
she
was
back
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
looking
down
into
the
fretful
dictatorial
old
face
i
will
bathe
you
chatterton
she
said
gently
i
bring
the
water
in
a
minute
xi
poor
polly
you
are
very
awkward
child
observed
chatterton
to
polly
on
her
knees
and
abrupt
move
the
sponge
more
slowly
there
that
is
better
polly
shifted
her
position
from
one
aching
knee
to
another
set
her
lips
closer
together
and
bent
all
her
young
energies
to
gentler
effects
but
chatterton
cried
out
irritably
have
you
never
taken
care
of
a
sick
person
pray
tell
or
is
it
all
your
training
that
makes
you
so
i
helped
mother
take
care
of
phronsie
when
she
had
the
measles
and
ben
and
joel
said
polly
five
years
ago
we
have
been
sick
lately
humph
ejaculated
chatterton
not
very
elegantly
but
what
was
the
use
of
a
fine
manner
when
there
was
nobody
but
a
little
maiden
to
see
it
i
shall
have
to
endure
it
till
hortense
returns
she
said
with
a
sigh
besides
it
is
my
duty
to
give
you
something
useful
to
do
in
this
house
you
should
be
thankful
that
i
allow
you
to
bathe
me
polly
eyes
flashed
and
the
hand
holding
the
sponge
trembled
nothing
but
the
fear
of
troubling
mamsie
and
dear
old
king
whose
forbearance
was
worn
to
the
finest
of
threads
kept
her
at
her
post
now
get
the
violet
water
said
chatterton
with
an
air
she
would
never
have
dared
employ
towards
hortense
it
is
the
bottle
in
the
lower
corner
of
the
case
polly
got
up
from
her
knees
and
stiffly
stumbled
across
the
room
to
the
case
of
toilet
articles
in
her
tumult
bringing
away
the
upper
corner
vial
stupide
exclaimed
chatterton
among
her
pillows
go
back
and
do
as
i
bid
you
girl
the
lower
corner
bottle
without
a
word
polly
returned
and
bringing
the
right
vial
set
about
its
use
as
directed
in
a
rapidly
growing
dismay
at
the
evil
feelings
surging
through
her
warning
her
it
would
not
be
safe
to
stay
in
the
room
much
longer
do
you
understand
presently
began
chatterton
fastening
her
cold
blue
eyes
upon
her
what
your
position
is
in
this
house
everybody
else
appears
to
be
blind
and
idiotic
to
the
last
degree
you
seem
to
have
a
little
quickness
to
catch
an
idea
as
polly
did
not
answer
the
question
was
repeated
very
sharply
do
you
understand
what
your
position
is
in
this
house
yes
said
polly
in
a
low
voice
and
dashing
out
the
violet
water
with
a
reckless
hand
i
do
take
care
impatiently
cried
chatterton
then
she
pushed
her
pillow
into
a
better
position
and
returned
to
the
charge
what
is
it
pray
since
you
understand
it
so
well
i
understand
that
i
am
here
in
this
house
said
polly
quite
cold
and
white
because
dear
king
wants
me
to
be
here
dear
mr
king
echoed
chatterton
in
shrill
disdain
stuff
and
nonsense
and
she
put
her
head
back
for
an
unpleasant
cackle
it
could
hardly
be
called
a
laugh
what
an
idiot
the
man
is
to
have
the
wool
pulled
over
his
eyes
in
this
fashion
i
tell
you
polly
and
she
raised
herself
up
on
her
elbow
the
soft
lace
falling
away
from
the
white
and
yet
shapely
arm
this
member
had
been
one
of
her
strongest
claims
to
beauty
and
even
in
her
rage
chatterton
paused
a
second
to
glance
complacently
at
it
in
its
new
position
you
are
when
all
is
said
about
your
dear
king
and
your
absurd
assumption
of
equality
with
refined
people
who
frequent
this
house
exactly
the
same
underbred
country
girl
as
you
were
in
your
old
brown
house
goodness
knows
wherever
that
is
i
glad
i
am
declared
polly
and
she
actually
laughed
merrily
while
she
squared
her
sturdy
shoulders
nothing
could
be
sweeter
than
to
hear
it
said
she
was
worthy
of
the
dear
little
old
brown
house
and
did
disgrace
mamsie
bringing
up
the
laugh
was
the
last
feather
that
overthrew
restraint
she
was
actually
furious
now
that
she
widow
of
algernon
chatterton
who
was
own
cousin
to
jasper
horatio
king
should
be
faced
by
such
presumption
and
her
words
put
aside
with
girlish
amusement
and
i
tell
you
more
she
went
on
sitting
quite
erect
now
on
the
bed
your
mother
thinks
she
is
doing
a
fine
thing
to
get
all
her
family
wormed
in
here
in
this
style
but
she
polly
pepper
the
girlish
gladness
gone
from
heart
and
face
waited
for
no
more
our
mother
she
cried
stormily
unable
to
utter
another
word
oh
oh
her
breath
came
in
quick
short
gasps
the
hot
indignant
blood
mounting
to
the
brown
waves
of
hair
on
her
brow
while
she
clasped
her
hands
so
tightly
together
the
pain
at
any
other
time
would
have
made
her
scream
chatterton
aghast
at
the
effect
of
her
words
leaned
back
once
more
against
her
pillows
do
try
to
work
up
a
scene
she
endeavored
to
say
carelessly
but
she
might
as
well
have
remonstrated
with
the
north
wind
the
little
country
maiden
had
a
temper
as
well
as
her
own
and
all
the
more
for
its
long
restraint
now
on
breaking
bounds
it
rushed
at
the
one
who
had
provoked
it
utterly
regardless
that
it
was
the
great
algernon
chatterton
for
two
minutes
so
breathlessly
did
polly
hurl
the
stinging
sentences
at
the
figure
on
the
bed
cousin
eunice
was
obliged
to
let
her
have
her
own
way
then
as
suddenly
the
torrent
ceased
polly
grew
quite
white
what
have
i
done
oh
what
have
i
done
she
cried
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
polly
polly
called
jasper
voice
below
she
knew
he
wanted
her
to
try
a
new
duet
he
had
gone
down
town
to
purchase
but
how
could
she
play
with
such
a
storm
in
her
heart
and
worse
than
all
else
was
the
consciousness
that
she
had
spoken
to
one
whose
gray
hairs
should
have
made
her
forget
the
provocation
received
words
that
now
plunged
her
into
a
hot
shame
to
recall
she
flew
over
the
stairs
up
away
from
every
one
sight
to
a
long
dark
lumber
room
partially
filled
with
trunks
and
a
few
articles
of
furniture
prized
as
heirlooms
but
no
longer
admissible
in
the
family
apartments
polly
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
sank
down
in
the
shadow
of
a
packing
box
half
filled
with
old
pictures
in
a
distress
that
would
not
even
let
her
think
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
too
angry
with
herself
to
cry
too
aghast
at
the
mischief
she
had
done
to
even
remember
the
dreadful
words
chatterton
had
said
to
her
for
of
course
now
she
will
complain
to
mamsie
and
i
really
afraid
king
will
find
it
out
and
it
only
needs
a
little
thing
to
make
him
send
her
off
he
said
yesterday
valentine
told
him
there
was
nothing
really
the
matter
with
her
and
dear
i
do
know
what
will
happen
to
poor
polly
crouching
there
on
the
floor
in
the
dim
and
dusty
corner
it
seemed
as
if
her
wretchedness
held
no
hope
turn
whichever
way
she
might
the
dreadful
words
she
had
uttered
rang
through
her
heart
they
could
not
be
unsaid
they
were
never
to
be
forgotten
but
must
always
stay
and
rankle
there
oh
oh
she
moaned
clasping
her
knees
with
distressed
little
palms
and
swaying
back
and
forth
why
did
i
remember
what
mamsie
has
always
told
us
that
no
insult
can
do
us
harm
if
only
we
do
not
say
or
do
anything
in
return
why
why
could
i
have
remembered
it
how
long
she
stayed
there
she
never
knew
but
at
last
realizing
that
every
moment
there
was
only
making
matters
worse
she
dragged
herself
up
from
the
little
heap
on
the
floor
and
trying
to
put
a
bit
of
cheerfulness
into
a
face
she
knew
must
frighten
mamsie
she
went
slowly
out
and
down
the
stairs
but
no
one
looked
long
enough
at
her
face
to
notice
its
change
of
expression
polly
the
moment
she
turned
towards
the
household
life
again
could
feel
that
the
air
was
charged
with
some
intense
excitement
hortense
met
her
on
the
lower
stairs
the
maid
was
startled
out
of
her
usual
nonchalance
and
was
actually
in
a
hurry
what
is
the
matter
cried
polly
oh
the
madame
is
eel
said
the
maid
the
doctaire
says
it
is
not
a
lie
dees
time
and
she
swept
past
polly
polly
clung
to
the
her
face
whitening
and
her
gaze
fastened
upon
chatterton
door
where
hortense
was
now
disappearing
inside
was
a
sound
of
voices
and
that
subdued
stir
that
gives
token
of
a
sick
room
i
have
killed
her
cried
polly
heart
for
one
wild
moment
she
was
impelled
to
flight
anywhere
she
did
not
care
where
to
shake
off
by
motion
in
the
free
air
this
paralysis
of
fear
but
the
next
she
started
and
rushing
down
the
stairs
and
into
king
room
cried
out
oh
dear
grandpapa
will
chatterton
die
no
no
i
think
not
replied
the
old
gentleman
surprised
at
her
feeling
cousin
eunice
never
did
show
much
but
then
i
do
believe
this
piece
of
bad
news
will
kill
her
bad
news
gasped
polly
hanging
to
the
table
where
king
was
writing
letters
oh
grandpapa
what
do
you
mean
bless
me
where
have
you
been
polly
pepper
said
king
settling
his
eyeglass
to
regard
her
closely
not
to
hear
the
uproar
in
this
house
yes
chatterton
received
a
telegram
a
since
that
her
nephew
the
only
one
that
she
was
very
fond
of
among
her
relatives
was
drowned
at
sea
and
she
has
been
perfectly
prostrated
by
it
till
she
really
is
quite
polly
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
flew
out
and
up
the
stairs
once
more
where
have
you
been
polly
cried
jasper
coming
out
of
a
side
passage
in
time
to
catch
a
dissolving
view
of
her
flying
figure
polly
polly
and
he
took
three
steps
to
her
one
and
gained
her
side
oh
do
stop
me
begged
polly
flying
on
do
jasper
he
took
a
good
look
at
her
face
anything
i
can
help
you
about
he
asked
quickly
she
suddenly
stopped
her
foot
on
the
stair
above
oh
jasper
she
cried
with
clasped
hands
you
do
know
she
may
die
and
i
said
horribly
cruel
things
to
her
who
mrs
chatterton
said
the
boy
opening
his
dark
eyes
why
you
could
have
said
cruel
things
to
her
polly
do
be
foolish
child
he
spoke
as
he
would
to
phronsie
terror
and
smiled
into
her
face
but
it
did
not
reassure
polly
jasper
you
do
know
you
ca
guess
what
dreadful
things
i
said
cried
poor
overwhelmed
polly
clasping
her
hands
tightly
together
at
the
mere
thought
of
the
words
she
had
uttered
then
she
must
have
said
dreadful
things
to
you
said
the
boy
she
but
oh
jasper
that
does
make
it
any
better
for
me
said
polly
do
stop
me
i
am
going
to
see
if
they
wo
let
me
do
something
for
her
there
are
ever
so
many
people
up
there
now
said
jasper
your
mother
and
hortense
and
two
or
three
maids
what
in
the
world
could
you
do
polly
come
down
into
the
library
and
tell
us
all
about
it
but
polly
broke
away
from
him
with
an
oh
i
must
do
something
for
her
speeding
on
until
she
softly
worked
her
way
into
the
sick
room
pepper
was
busy
with
the
doctor
in
the
further
part
of
the
room
and
polly
stood
quite
still
for
a
moment
wishing
she
were
one
of
the
maids
to
whom
a
bit
of
active
service
was
given
she
could
not
longer
endure
her
thoughts
in
silence
and
gently
going
up
to
her
side
with
a
timorous
glance
at
the
bed
as
she
passed
it
she
begged
mamsie
ca
i
do
something
for
her
pepper
glanced
up
quickly
no
yes
you
can
take
this
prescription
down
to
oakley
to
be
prepared
polly
seized
the
bit
of
paper
from
valentine
hand
and
hurried
out
again
she
glanced
fearfully
at
the
bed
but
the
curtain
on
that
side
was
drawn
so
that
only
the
outline
of
the
figure
could
be
seen
she
was
soon
out
on
the
street
the
movement
through
the
fresh
air
bringing
back
a
little
color
to
her
cheek
and
courage
to
her
heart
things
did
not
seem
quite
so
bad
if
she
only
might
do
something
for
the
poor
sick
woman
that
could
atone
for
the
wretched
work
she
had
done
at
least
it
would
be
some
comfort
if
the
invalid
could
be
helped
by
her
service
thus
revolving
everything
in
her
mind
polly
did
not
hear
her
name
called
nor
rapid
footsteps
hurrying
after
wait
at
last
cried
a
voice
o
dear
me
what
is
the
matter
polly
alexia
rhys
drew
herself
up
flushed
and
panting
at
polly
side
i
on
the
way
to
the
apothecary
said
polly
without
looking
around
so
i
should
suppose
said
alexia
o
dear
i
so
hot
and
tired
do
go
a
bit
slower
polly
i
ca
said
polly
she
very
sick
and
i
must
get
this
just
as
soon
as
i
can
she
waved
the
prescription
at
her
and
redoubled
her
speed
who
gasped
alexia
stumbling
after
as
best
she
could
chatterton
said
polly
a
lump
in
her
throat
as
she
uttered
the
name
o
dear
me
that
old
thing
cried
alexia
her
enthusiasm
over
the
errand
gone
hush
said
polly
hoarsely
she
may
die
she
has
had
bad
news
what
asked
alexia
the
uncomfortable
walk
might
be
enlivened
by
a
bit
of
stray
gossip
what
is
it
polly
what
news
a
telegram
said
polly
her
favorite
nephew
was
drowned
at
sea
oh
i
did
know
she
had
any
favorite
nephew
does
she
fight
with
everybody
do
be
quiet
begged
polly
no
that
is
perhaps
other
people
are
not
kind
to
her
oh
said
alexia
in
a
surprised
voice
well
i
think
she
perfectly
and
horrid
so
do
race
like
this
through
the
streets
polly
you
get
there
soon
enough
but
polly
turned
a
deaf
ear
and
at
last
the
prescription
was
handed
over
the
counter
at
oakley
and
after
what
seemed
an
endless
time
to
polly
the
medicine
was
given
to
her
now
as
soon
as
you
carry
that
thing
home
observed
alexia
glancing
at
the
white
parcel
in
polly
hand
i
hope
you
come
with
us
girls
that
what
i
ran
after
you
for
what
girls
asked
polly
why
philena
and
the
cornwalls
we
are
going
to
have
a
sleighing
party
and
a
supper
at
lilly
drexell
cornwall
chaperones
the
thing
polly
was
surprised
to
feel
her
heart
bound
it
had
seemed
as
if
it
could
ever
be
moved
by
any
news
of
girlish
frolics
but
that
its
dull
ache
must
go
on
forever
oh
i
ca
she
cried
the
next
moment
i
must
stay
at
home
and
help
take
care
of
mrs
chatterton
nonsense
exclaimed
alexia
in
a
provoked
tone
you
are
not
wanted
there
polly
pepper
the
idea
with
that
great
house
full
of
servants
well
i
shall
not
go
declared
polly
sharply
you
need
ask
me
alexia
i
shall
stay
home
till
she
gets
well
you
little
idiot
cried
alexia
thoroughly
out
of
temper
but
as
this
produced
no
effect
on
polly
she
began
to
wheedle
and
coax
now
polly
do
be
reasonable
you
know
we
ca
go
without
you
you
spoil
the
whole
thing
you
know
you
would
i
shall
just
tell
the
cornwalls
that
you
are
coming
and
she
turned
off
to
the
corner
of
the
avenue
indeed
you
will
not
called
polly
after
her
do
you
dare
do
that
alexia
rhys
she
said
with
flashing
eyes
you
are
the
most
uncomfortable
girl
i
ever
saw
cried
alexia
stopping
to
come
slowly
back
you
spoil
every
bit
of
fun
with
your
absurd
notions
i
quite
quite
put
out
with
you
polly
i
sorry
said
poor
polly
fairly
longing
for
the
and
dismayed
at
disappointing
the
girls
no
you
not
pouted
alexia
and
i
shall
tell
them
all
so
and
she
broke
away
and
ran
off
in
the
opposite
direction
polly
was
met
at
the
door
by
pepper
who
grasped
the
packet
of
medicine
quickly
is
there
anything
else
i
can
do
mamsie
begged
polly
no
sit
down
and
rest
you
hot
and
tired
you
run
so
i
not
tired
said
polly
not
daring
to
ask
is
she
better
well
you
must
be
said
pepper
hurrying
off
going
all
the
way
down
to
oakley
so
polly
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
sit
out
in
the
hall
and
listen
and
watch
all
the
movements
in
the
sick
room
every
one
of
which
but
increased
her
terror
at
least
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
as
valentine
came
out
putting
on
his
gloves
she
rushed
after
him
oh
will
she
die
she
begged
please
do
tell
me
sir
die
no
indeed
i
hope
not
said
valentine
she
has
had
a
severe
shock
to
her
nerves
and
her
age
is
against
her
but
she
is
coming
around
all
right
i
trust
why
polly
i
thought
better
things
of
you
my
girl
he
glanced
down
into
the
distressed
face
with
professional
disfavor
i
so
glad
she
wo
die
breathed
polly
wholly
lost
to
his
opinion
of
her
and
her
face
gleamed
with
something
of
her
old
brightness
i
did
know
you
were
so
fond
of
her
observed
valentine
grimly
indeed
to
speak
truthfully
i
have
yet
to
learn
that
anybody
is
fond
of
her
polly
now
if
you
really
want
to
help
her
he
continued
thoughtfully
pulling
his
beard
as
polly
did
not
answer
i
can
give
you
one
or
two
hints
that
might
be
of
use
oh
i
do
i
do
cried
polly
with
eagerness
it
will
be
tiresome
work
said
valentine
but
it
will
be
a
piece
of
real
charity
and
perhaps
polly
it
as
well
for
you
to
begin
now
as
to
wait
till
you
can
belong
to
forty
charity
clubs
and
spend
your
time
going
to
committee
meetings
and
he
laughed
not
altogether
pleasantly
how
was
polly
to
know
that
valentine
was
immersed
up
to
her
ears
in
a
philanthropic
sea
with
the
smallest
possible
thought
for
the
doctor
home
now
that
maid
said
the
physician
dropping
his
tone
to
a
confidential
one
is
as
well
as
the
average
but
not
the
one
who
is
to
amuse
the
old
lady
it
that
she
needs
more
than
medicine
polly
she
actually
requires
diversion
poor
polly
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
diversion
and
she
had
thrown
away
all
chance
of
that
she
is
suffering
for
the
companionship
of
some
bright
young
nature
valentine
proceeded
attributing
the
dismay
written
all
over
the
girl
face
to
natural
unwillingness
to
do
the
service
after
she
gets
over
this
attack
she
needs
to
be
read
to
for
one
thing
to
be
told
the
news
to
be
made
to
forget
herself
but
of
course
polly
he
said
hastily
buttoning
his
top
coat
and
opening
the
outer
door
it
too
much
to
ask
of
you
so
think
no
more
about
it
child
xii
new
work
for
polly
it
was
saturday
morning
and
polly
ran
upstairs
with
a
bright
face
the
morning
journal
in
her
hand
i
going
to
stay
with
chatterton
hortense
she
announced
to
that
functionary
in
the
and
a
comfairte
may
it
gif
to
you
said
hortense
with
a
vicious
shake
of
the
silk
wrapper
in
her
hand
before
hanging
it
in
its
place
madame
has
the
tres
diablerie
cross
as
de
two
steeks
what
you
call
it
dis
morning
polly
went
softly
into
the
room
closing
the
door
gently
after
her
in
the
shadow
of
one
corner
of
the
large
apartment
sat
chatterton
under
many
wrappings
in
the
depths
of
an
invalid
chair
polly
went
up
to
her
side
would
you
like
to
have
me
read
the
news
mrs
chatterton
she
asked
gently
chatterton
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
her
no
she
was
about
to
say
shortly
just
as
she
had
repulsed
many
little
offers
of
for
the
past
few
days
but
somehow
this
morning
the
crackling
of
the
fresh
sheet
in
the
girl
hand
suggestive
of
crisp
bits
of
gossip
was
too
much
for
her
to
hear
indifferently
especially
as
she
was
in
a
worse
state
of
mind
than
usual
over
hortense
and
her
bad
temper
you
may
sit
down
and
read
a
little
if
you
like
she
said
ungraciously
so
polly
happy
as
a
queen
at
the
permission
slipped
into
a
convenient
chair
and
began
at
once
she
happened
fortunately
on
just
the
right
things
for
the
hungry
ears
a
description
of
a
large
church
wedding
the
day
before
two
or
three
bits
about
society
people
that
chatterton
had
lost
sight
of
and
a
few
other
items
just
as
acceptable
polly
read
on
and
on
from
one
thing
to
another
not
daring
to
look
up
to
see
the
effect
until
at
last
everything
in
the
way
of
gossip
was
exhausted
is
that
all
asked
chatterton
hungrily
polly
hunting
the
columns
for
anything
even
a
murder
account
if
it
was
but
in
high
life
turned
the
paper
again
disconsolately
obliged
to
confess
it
was
well
do
put
it
by
then
said
chatterton
sharply
and
not
whirl
it
before
my
face
it
gives
me
a
frightful
headache
i
might
get
the
town
talk
suggested
polly
as
a
bright
thought
struck
her
it
came
yesterday
i
saw
it
on
the
library
table
so
it
is
saturday
chatterton
looked
up
quickly
yes
you
may
polly
her
mouth
watering
for
the
revel
she
would
have
in
its
contents
so
polly
ran
over
the
stairs
with
delighted
feet
and
into
the
library
beginning
to
rummage
over
the
papers
and
magazines
on
the
reading
table
where
is
it
she
exclaimed
turning
them
with
quick
fingers
o
dear
it
was
right
here
last
evening
what
is
it
asked
phronsie
from
the
depths
of
a
big
and
looking
up
from
her
book
then
she
saw
as
soon
as
she
had
asked
the
question
that
polly
was
in
trouble
so
she
laid
down
her
book
and
slid
out
of
the
chair
what
is
it
polly
let
me
help
you
do
why
the
town
talk
that
hateful
old
society
thing
said
polly
throwing
the
papers
to
right
and
left
you
know
phronsie
it
has
a
picture
of
a
bottle
of
ink
and
a
big
quill
for
a
heading
o
dear

help
me
child
for
she
will
get
nervous
if
i
am
gone
long
oh
i
know
where
that
is
said
phronsie
deliberately
laying
a
cool
little
hand
on
polly
hot
one
where
demanded
polly
feverishly
oh
phronsie
where
jack
rutherford
has
it
polly
threw
down
the
papers
and
started
for
the
door
he
has
gone
said
phronsie
he
went
home
almost
an
hour
ago
polly
turned
sharply
at
her
what
did
he
want
town
talk
for
he
said
it
was
big
and
he
asked
grandpapa
if
he
might
have
it
and
grandpapa
said
yes
i
do
know
what
he
wanted
it
for
said
phronsie
and
he
took
other
newspapers
too
polly
oh
ever
so
many
well
i
do
care
how
many
he
took
nor
what
they
were
cried
polly
only
that
very
identical
one
o
dear
me
well
i
ask
jasper
and
rushing
from
the
library
phronsie
following
in
a
small
panic
over
polly
distress
she
knocked
at
the
door
of
jasper
den
a
little
room
in
the
wing
looking
out
on
the
east
lawn
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
are
here
she
exclaimed
as
come
in
greeted
her
and
both
phronsie
and
she
precipitated
themselves
with
no
show
of
ceremony
in
front
of
his
study
table
o
jasper
could
you
get
me
a
copy
of
town
talk

rutherford

repeated
jasper
raising
his
head
from
his
hands
to
stare
at
her
yes
jack
has
taken
ours
off
grandpapa
gave
it
to
him
can
you
jasper
will
it
break
up
your
study
much
she
poured
out
anxiously
no
that
is
never
mind
said
jasper
pushing
the
book
away
and
springing
from
his
chair
but
whatever
in
the
world
do
you
want
that
trash
for
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
curiously
chatterton
will
let
me
read
it
to
her
she
said
so
cried
polly
clasping
her
hands
nervously
but
if
i
do
get
the
paper
soon
why
i
afraid
she
change
her
mind
jasper
gave
a
low
whistle
as
he
flung
himself
into
his
coat
inestimable
privilege
he
exclaimed
at
last
tossing
on
his
cap
oh
jasper
you
are
so
good
cried
polly
in
a
small
rapture
i
so
sorry
to
have
to
ask
you

go
for
you
jasper
declared
phronsie
mamsie
will
let
me
i
almost
know
she
will
no
no
phronsie
said
jasper
as
she
was
flying
off
it
is
any
place
for
you
to
go
to
i
shall
get
one
at
the
hotel
the
allibone
i
be
back
in
a
trice
polly
polly
went
out
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
big
oaken
chairs
in
the
hall
to
seize
it
as
it
came
and
phronsie
deposited
herself
in
an
opposite
chair
and
watched
polly
and
presently
in
came
jasper
waving
the
desired
journal
polly
with
a
beaming
face
grasped
it
and
rushed
off
upstairs
polly
called
the
boy
looking
after
her
it
is
too
late
now
for
you
to
go
with
them
lucy
bennett
met
me
at
the
corner
and
she
said
they
will
take
the
twelve
train
instead
of
the
eleven
and
she
wanted
me
to
beg
you
to
come
no
no
tossed
back
polly
rushing
on
i
am
quite
determined
to
stay
at
home
then
she
went
into
chatterton
room
and
closed
the
door
but
she
could
so
easily
shut
out
the
longings
that
would
rise
in
her
heart
for
the
saturday
outing
that
the
other
girls
were
to
have
how
lovely
it
would
be
the
run
out
to
silvia
horne
charming
house
some
ten
miles
distant
the
elegant
luncheon
they
would
have
followed
by
games
and
a
dance
in
the
upstairs
that
silvia
older
sisters
used
for
their
beautiful
parties
then
the
merry
return
before
dusk
of
the
twelve
girls
all
capital
friends
at
school
oh
oh
you
been
an
unconscionable
time
exclaimed
chatterton
in
a
sharp
high
key
just
to
get
a
paper
well
do
sit
down
i
am
quite
tired
waiting
for
you
polly
sat
down
and
resolutely
plunged
into
the
column
where
the
news
items
promised
the
most
plentiful
yield
but
in
between
the
lines
ran
the
doings
of
the
girls
how
they
were
all
assembling
by
this
time
at
lucy
bennett
how
they
were
hurrying
off
to
the
train
and
all
the
other
delightful
movements
of
the
outing
flashed
before
her
eyes
as
she
finished
item
after
item
of
her
dreary
task
but
how
chatterton
gloated
over
it
at
last
polly
feeling
as
if
she
could
not
endure
another
five
minutes
of
it
glanced
up
to
see
the
old
lady
eyes
actually
sparkling
her
mouth
had
fallen
into
contented
curves
and
the
jeweled
hand
resting
on
the
was
playing
with
the
fringe
while
she
leaned
forward
that
she
might
not
lose
a
word
read
that
again
polly
she
said
the
list
of
presents
exhibited
at
arabella
granger
wedding
i
did
hear
any
mention
of
the
archibalds
it
ca
be
that
they
have
fallen
out
and
read
more
slowly
so
polly
began
once
more
the
long
lists
of
gifts
that
ushered
in
the
matrimonial
happiness
of
john
westover
nee
miss
arabella
granger
this
time
however
stimulated
by
the
pleasure
she
was
giving
to
find
it
an
endurable
task
it
seemed
to
polly
as
if
john
westover
had
everything
on
earth
given
to
her
that
could
possibly
be
presented
at
a
wedding
nevertheless
the
list
was
gone
through
again
bravely
polly
retracing
her
steps
two
or
three
times
to
read
the
items
over
for
her
slow
digestion
the
archibalds
are
not
mentioned
either
as
being
there
or
sending
a
gift
nor
the
harlands
nor
the
smythes
so
i
am
very
glad
i
remember
her
said
chatterton
drawing
herself
up
with
a
relieved
sigh
those
presents
sound
fine
on
paper
but
it
is
as
well
as
she
might
have
done
if
she
had
made
a
different
match
now
something
else
polly
and
she
dismissed
westover
with
a
careless
wave
of
her
hand
polly
flew
off
into
the
fashion
hints
and
was
immediately
lost
in
the
whirl
of
coming
toilets
no
one
noticed
when
the
door
opened
so
of
course
no
one
saw
whitney
standing
smiling
behind
the
old
lady
big
chair
well
polly
said
a
pleasant
voice
suddenly
down
went
town
talk
to
the
floor
as
polly
sprang
up
with
a
glad
cry
and
chatterton
turned
around
nervously
oh
auntie
auntie
cried
polly
convulsively
clinging
to
her
are
you
really
here
and
is
dicky
home
dear
child
said
whitney
as
much
a
girl
for
the
moment
as
polly
herself
and
pressing
kisses
on
the
red
lips
while
she
folded
her
close
yes
dick
is
at
home
there
go
and
find
him
he
is
in
pepper
room
i
am
glad
to
see
you
so
much
better
chatterton
said
whitney
leaning
over
the
invalid
chair
to
lay
the
tenderest
of
palms
on
the
hand
resting
on
the
oh
yes
marian
i
am
better
said
chatterton
looking
around
for
polly
then
down
at
the
delicious
town
talk
carelessly
thrown
on
the
floor
will
you
send
her
back
as
soon
as
possible
she
asked
with
her
old
imperativeness
who
polly
said
whitney
following
the
glance
why
she
has
gone
to
see
dick
you
know
now
why
can
not
i
read
a
bit
and
she
picked
up
the
paper
you
do
know
what
has
been
read
said
chatterton
as
whitney
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
running
her
eye
in
a
practiced
way
over
the
front
page
dear
me
it
makes
me
quite
nervous
marian
to
see
you
prowling
around
all
over
the
sheet
that
way
oh
i
shall
find
something
interesting
quite
soon
i
fancy
said
whitney
cheerfully
her
heart
on
her
boy
and
the
jolly
he
was
having
here
is
the
washington
news
i
mean
all
about
the
receptions
and
teas
she
has
read
that
said
chatterton
now
for
the
fashion
department
whitney
whirled
the
paper
over
dexterously
do
you
know
chatterton
gray
stuffs
are
to
be
worn
more
than
ever
this
spring
i
do
care
about
that
said
chatterton
quickly
and
besides
quite
likely
there
be
a
complete
revolution
before
spring
really
sets
in
and
gray
stuffs
will
go
out
find
some
description
of
tea
gowns
ca
you
i
must
have
one
or
two
more
and
here
are
some
wonderfully
pretty
caps
if
they
are
all
like
the
descriptions
said
whitney
unluckily
dropping
on
another
paragraph
caps
who
wants
to
hear
about
them
cried
chatterton
in
a
dudgeon
i
hope
i
not
at
the
cap
period
yet
oh
those
lovely
little
lace
arrangements
said
whitney
hastily
do
you
know
how
exquisite
they
are
at
pinaud
she
cried
i
sure
i
never
noticed
said
chatterton
indifferently
hortense
always
arranges
my
hair
better
without
lace
if
you
find
what
i
ask
you
marian
raising
her
voice
to
a
higher
key
you
need
trouble
to
read
at
all
fortunately
the
description
of
the
gown
worn
by
lady
hartly
cavendish
at
a
london
high
tea
stood
out
in
bold
relief
as
whitney
eyes
nervously
ran
over
the
columns
again
and
she
seized
upon
it
but
in
just
two
moments
she
was
interrupted
send
that
girl
back
again
marian
cried
chatterton
i
had
just
got
her
trained
so
that
she
suits
me
it
tires
me
to
death
to
hear
you
i
do
not
know
whether
polly
can
come
now
said
whitney
gently
she
do
not
know
whether
polly
can
come
repeated
chatterton
sharply
and
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
did
i
say
i
wanted
her
you
did
marian
tone
did
not
lose
a
note
of
its
ordinary
gentleness
but
i
shall
ask
her
if
she
is
willing
to
do
it
as
a
favor
chatterton
you
quite
understand
that
of
course
she
too
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
and
gazed
into
the
cold
hard
face
just
like
your
father
cried
chatterton
settling
herself
irascibly
back
in
the
again
there
is
no
hope
that
affairs
in
this
house
will
mend
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
i
am
so
glad
that
you
consider
me
like
my
father
said
whitney
gleefully
as
a
child
we
surely
are
united
on
this
question
may
i
read
some
more
cried
polly
coming
in
softly
and
trying
to
calm
the
impetuous
rush
of
delight
as
her
eyes
met
whitney
yes
i
am
waiting
for
you
said
chatterton
begin
where
you
left
off
whitney
bit
her
pretty
lips
and
slipped
out
of
her
chair
just
pausing
a
moment
to
lay
her
hand
on
the
young
shoulder
as
she
passed
and
a
world
of
comfort
fell
upon
polly
shut
in
once
more
to
her
dreary
task
how
perfectly
splendid
that
i
did
go
to
silvia
home
luncheon
party
now
cried
polly
heart
over
and
over
between
the
lines
if
i
had
i
should
have
missed
dear
auntie
and
dicky
she
glanced
up
with
luminous
eyes
as
she
whirled
the
sheet
chatterton
astonishing
as
it
may
seem
was
actually
smiling
it
some
comfort
to
hear
you
read
she
observed
with
a
sigh
of
enjoyment
because
you
enjoy
it
yourself
i
would
give
a
fig
for
anybody
to
try
to
do
it
polly
felt
like
a
guilty
little
thing
to
take
this
quietly
and
she
eased
her
conscience
by
being
more
glad
that
she
was
in
that
very
room
doing
that
very
task
and
so
the
moments
sped
on
outside
dick
was
holding
high
revel
as
every
one
revolved
around
him
the
hero
of
the
coasting
accident
till
the
boy
ran
considerable
danger
from
all
the
attention
he
was
receiving
but
one
glance
and
a
smile
from
whitney
brought
him
back
to
himself
do
talk
any
more
about
it
he
cried
a
trifle
impatiently
i
was
a
muff
to
stick
on
when
i
knew
we
were
going
over
mamma
wo
you
stop
them
and
she
did
do
you
know
dicky
and
i
have
a
secret
to
tell
all
of
you
good
people
the
color
flew
into
her
soft
cheek
and
her
eyes
beamed
really
marian
said
her
father
whose
hand
had
scarcely
ceased
patting
dick
brown
head
since
the
boy
you
grown
young
in
badgertown
i
never
saw
you
look
so
well
as
you
do
whitney
laughed
and
tossed
him
a
gay
little
smile
that
carried
him
back
to
the
days
when
marian
king
stood
before
him
looking
just
so
now
listen
father
and
all
you
good
people
to
my
secret
dicky
and
mine
we
are
allowed
to
tell
it
now
papa
whitney
sailed
in
the
servia
and
he
ought
to
be
in
a
shout
of
joy
greeted
her
announcement
polly
off
in
her
prison
could
hear
the
merry
sounds
and
her
happy
heart
echoed
them
the
misery
of
the
past
week
when
she
had
been
bearing
an
unatoned
fault
seemed
to
drop
away
from
her
as
she
listened
and
to
say
life
holds
sunshine
yet
then
a
hush
dropped
upon
the
gay
uproar
she
did
not
know
that
dicky
was
proclaiming
yes
and
he
is
never
never
going
back
again
that
is
unless
he
takes
mamma
and
me
you
know
chatterton
turned
suddenly
upon
the
young
figure
do
go
she
tossed
an
imperative
command
with
her
jeweled
fingers
you
have
ceased
to
be
amusing
since
your
interest
is
all
in
the
other
room
with
that
boy
polly
dashed
the
newspaper
to
the
floor
and
rushing
impulsively
across
the
room
threw
herself
with
no
thought
for
the
consequences
on
her
knees
at
chatterton
chair
oh
oh
she
cried
the
color
flying
up
to
the
brown
waves
on
her
temples
do
send
me
off
then
i
shall
know
you
never
will
forgive
me
get
up
do
exclaimed
chatterton
in
disgust
you
are
crushing
my
gown
and
besides
i
hate
scenes
but
polly
held
resolutely
to
the
and
never
took
her
brown
eyes
from
the
cold
face
i
must
say
polly
pepper
cried
chatterton
with
rising
anger
you
are
the
most
disagreeable
girl
that
i
ever
had
the
misfortune
to
meet
i
for
one
will
not
put
up
with
your
constant
ebullitions
of
temper
go
out
of
this
room
polly
rose
slowly
and
drew
herself
up
with
something
so
new
in
face
and
manner
that
the
old
lady
instinctively
put
up
her
eyeglass
and
gazed
curiously
through
it
as
one
would
look
at
a
strange
animal
humph
she
said
slowly
at
last
well
what
do
you
want
to
say
speak
out
and
then
go
nothing
said
polly
in
a
low
voice
but
quite
distinctly
only
i
shall
not
trouble
you
again
mrs
chatterton
and
as
the
last
words
were
spoken
she
was
out
of
the
room
pretty
doings
these
king
by
a
dexterous
movement
succeeded
in
slipping
back
of
the
portiere
folds
into
the
little
as
polly
rushed
out
through
the
other
doorway
into
the
hall
a
fortunate
thing
it
was
that
i
left
dick
to
see
what
had
become
of
polly
now
cousin
eunice
you
move
from
my
house
and
descending
the
stairs
he
called
determinedly
polly
polly
child
polly
off
in
her
own
room
now
heard
him
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
wished
she
need
not
answer
polly
polly
the
determined
call
rang
down
the
passage
causing
her
to
run
fast
with
a
yes
grandpapa
i
coming
now
i
should
just
like
to
inquire
began
king
taking
her
by
her
two
young
shoulders
and
looking
down
into
the
flushed
face
what
she
has
been
saying
to
you
oh
grandpapa
down
went
polly
brown
head
do
make
me
tell
please
do
grandpapa

shall
declared
king
every
blessed
word
now
begin
she
she
wanted
me
to
go
out
of
the
room
said
polly
in
a
reluctant
gasp
indeed
snorted
king
well
she
will
soon
go
out
of
that
room
indeed
i
might
say
out
of
the
house
oh
grandpapa
exclaimed
polly
in
great
distress
and
raising
the
brown
eyes
he
was
dismayed
to
find
them
filling
with
tears
do
do
send
her
away
it
is
all
my
fault
indeed
it
is
grandpapa
your
fault
cried
king
irately
you
must
not
say
such
things
child
that
silly
you
do
know
the
woman
grandpapa
cried
polly
holding
back
the
storm
of
tears
to
get
the
words
out
i
never
told
you
i
could
but
i
said
perfectly
dreadful
words
to
her
a
week
ago
oh
grandpapa
i
did
truly
that
right
said
the
old
gentleman
in
a
pleased
tone
what
were
they
pray
tell
let
us
know
oh
grandpapa
do
begged
polly
with
a
shiver
i
want
to
forget
them
if
you
would
only
follow
them
up
with
more
said
king
meditatively
when
it
comes
to
tears
she
must
march
you
know
i
wo
cry
said
polly
swallowing
the
lump
in
her
throat
if
you
will
only
let
her
stay
she
turned
to
him
such
a
distressed
and
white
face
that
king
stood
perplexedly
looking
down
at
her
having
nothing
to
say
i
tired
of
her
at
last
he
said
we
are
all
tired
of
her
she
has
about
worn
us
out
grandpapa
cried
polly
seeing
her
advantage
in
his
hesitation
if
you
will
only
let
her
stay
i
will
never
beg
you
for
anything
again
well
then
she
goes
cried
king
shortly
goodness

polly
if
you
are
going
to
stop
asking
favors
cousin
eunice
marches
instanter
oh
i
beg
and
tease

ever
so
many
things
cried
polly
radiantly
her
color
coming
back
will
you
let
her
stay
grandpapa
will
you
she
clasped
his
arm
tightly
and
would
not
let
him
go
well
said
king
slowly
i
think
about
it
polly
will
you
cried
polly
dear
grandpapa
please
say
yes
king
drew
a
long
breath
yes
he
said
at
last
xiii
a
piece
of
news
collect
the
whole
bunch
of
peppers
and
send
them
into
my
marian
old
king
mounting
the
stairs
turned
to
see
that
his
command
was
heard
you
want
mother
pepper
too
i
presume
said
whitney
pausing
at
the
foot
mother
pepper
no
indeed
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
wish
to
see
cried
her
father
irritably
the
bunch
of
pepper
children
i
want
and
at
once
see
that
they
all
report
to
me
directly
with
that
he
redoubled
his
efforts
and
was
soon
at
the
top
of
the
long
oaken
steps
polly
and
ben
closely
followed
by
joel
david
and
phronsie
soon
rushed
over
the
same
ascending
thoroughfare
and
presented
themselves
flushed
and
panting
at
the
door
come
in
called
king
from
within
here
we
are
sir
said
ben
spokesman
by
virtue
of
being
the
eldest
yes
yes
said
king
nervously
and
turning
away
from
some
papers
he
was
fumbling
to
occupy
the
waiting
moments
well
do
sit
down
all
of
you
i
sent
for
you
to
have
a
talk
about
something
that
you
that
you
well
do
sit
down
so
all
the
peppers
deposited
themselves
in
various
all
but
joel
he
immediately
marched
up
to
the
old
gentleman
chair
if
it
good
news
he
said
abruptly
please
let
us
have
it
right
this
minute
but
if
it
bad
why
a
gathering
alarm
stole
over
his
chubby
countenance
as
he
scanned
the
face
before
him
i
going
it
good
or
bad
news
according
as
you
take
it
said
the
old
gentleman
it
ought
to
be
good
but
there
pushing
back
his
chair
to
look
at
the
row
of
anxious
figures
the
other
side
of
the
table
do
sit
down
with
the
rest
joe
and
stop
staring
me
out
of
countenance
polly
at
that
pushed
a
chair
over
toward
joel
who
persuading
himself
into
it
sat
uncomfortably
perched
on
its
edge
where
he
stared
harder
than
ever
hum
well
children
now
you
are
all
remarkably
sensible
boys
and
girls
remarkably
sensible
i
always
said
so
and
i
see
no
reason
to
change
my
opinion
of
you
now
and
so
although
at
first
my
news
may
not
be
quite
to
your
liking
why
you
quickly
make
it
so
and
be
very
happy
about
it
in
the
end
hem
well
did
you
ever
think
that
that
your
mother
might
possibly
marry
again
the
last
words
were
brought
out
so
abruptly
that
to
the
five
pairs
of
ears
strained
to
catch
their
import
it
seemed
as
if
the
news
had
shot
by
harmlessly
but
after
a
breathing
space
the
dreadful
marry
and
your
mother
came
back
to
them
bringing
the
several
owners
of
the
ears
out
of
their
chairs
at
one
bound
our
mother
ben
hoarsely
exclaimed
oh
how
can
you
cried
polly
passionately
a
little
white
line
showing
around
her
mouth
say
such
perfectly
dreadful
things
sir
phronsie
clasped
her
hands
in
silent
terror
and
raised
big
eyes
to
his
face
david
began
to
walk
helplessly
down
the
apartment
see
here
said
joel
turning
to
the
others
wait
a
minute
and
hold
on
perhaps
it
you
sir
whirling
back
to
question
with
piercing
eyes
the
old
gentleman
who
going
to
marry
our
mother
then
it
all
right
me
roared
the
old
gentleman
oh
bless
my
soul
what
should
i
want
to
marry
for
at
my
time
of
life
oh
my
goodness
me
his
distress
was
now
so
frightful
to
see
that
it
brought
the
peppers
in
a
measure
out
of
theirs
and
they
began
at
once
to
endeavor
to
soothe
him
do
oh
do
they
cried
and
a
common
trouble
overwhelming
them
they
rushed
around
the
table
seized
his
hands
and
patted
his
shoulders
and
hair
oh
this
is
very
dreadful
gasped
polly
but
do
you
feel
badly
dear
dear
grandpapa
i

to
myself
then
there
now
that
something
like
as
phronsie
with
a
low
cry
hopped
into
her
usual
nest
now
perhaps
i
can
communicate
the
rest
of
my
news
when
i
get
my
breath
the
peppers
held
theirs
and
he
began
once
more
now
children
it
is
in
the
course
of
nature
for
such
a
fine
bright
woman
as
your
mother
to
remain
single
the
rest
of
her
life
somebody
would
be
sure
to
come
and
carry
her
off
i
glad
it
to
be
in
my
lifetime
for
now
i
can
be
easy
in
my
mind
and
feel
that
you
have
a
protector
when
i
am
gone
there
there
we
wo
talk
about
that
as
the
young
faces
turned
dark
with
sudden
pain
while
joel
rushed
convulsively
to
the
window
you
can
see
how
i
feel
about
it
are
you
glad
cried
ben
hoarsely
polly
for

turning
round
and
sinking
beneath
her
feet
yes

am
said
the
old
gentleman
and
it
wo
alter
the
existing
state
of

if

no

he
added
brightening
up
for
you

very
sensible
young
people
i
always
said
so
who
is
he
the
dreadful
question
trembled
on
all
the
lips
but
no
one
asked
it
seeing
this
king
broke
out
well
now
of

away
from
the
window
with
a
howl
while

tumultuously
threw
herself
within
the
kind
arms
encircling
phronsie
next
to
you
cried
the
boy
why

a
brick
fisher

you
tell

before
that

sobbed
polly
with
joyful
tears
running
over
her
face
davie
coming
out
of
his
gloomy
walk
turned
a
happy
face
towards
the
old
man
chair
while
ben
said
something
to
himself
that
sounded
like
thank
god
phronsie
alone
remained
unmoved
what
is
fisher
going
to
do
she
asked
presently
amid
the
chatter
that
now
broke
forth
he
going
to
live
here
said
old
king
looking
down
at
her
and
smoothing
her
yellow
hair

she
added
with
great
satisfaction
yes
you

said
the
old
gentleman
winking
furiously
to
keep
back
the
excited
flow
of
information
that
now
threatened
the
child
well
phronsie
you
love
fisher

cautiously
watching
her
face
at
each
syllable

laughed
softly
at
the
idea
why

could
be
my
father

phronsie
and
king
took
both
her
hands
in
his
and
tell
you
about
it
so
that
you
will
understand
fisher
loves
your
mother
he
has
loved
her
for
many
years
all
those
years
when
she
was
struggling
on
in
the
little
brown
house
but
he
could
tell
her
so
because
he
had
others
depending
on
him
for
support
they
do
need
him
now
and
as
soon
as
he
is
free
he

sharp
and
sudden

phronsie
in

she
jumped
out

to
dance
around
the
room
softly
clapping
her
hands
and
exclaiming
oh

said
king

by

claim
of

here

the
mending
basket
before
her
piled
to
the
brim
with
the
weekly
installment
of
stockings
big
and
little
clamoring
for
attention
but
the
usually
busy
needle
lay
idle
and
the
busier
hands
were
folded
as
the
went
over
the
words
she
knew
were
being
rehearsed
downstairs
by
the
kind
friend
who
had
made
a
home
for
them
he
was
pleading
her
cause
with
her
children
they

be
happy
anyway
she
said
softly
to
herself
bless
their
hearts
as
they
burst
in
mother
said
ben
how
the
boy
cheek
glowed
and
what
a
world
of

days
everybody
in
the
king
set

mother

five
little
peppers

condoled

clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
as

rushed
down
the
aisle
of
the
store
occupied
by
cabot
van
meter
halloo
said
ben

pickering
lugubriously
i
know
fisher
said
ben
that
enough
well
when
you
want
comfort
come
to
me
said
pickering
or
your
uncle
do

ben
ears
with
your
foolishness
said
the
senior
partner
coming
out
of
the
take
yourself
off
pickering
you
hindering
ben
pickering
laughed
i
caught
in
the
very
act
now
ben
remember
your
friend
when
you
get
into
trouble
with
your
dear
uncle
with
a
bright
nod
and
a
lazy
shake
of
his
long
figure
trade
always
demoralizes
me
i
get
back
to
my
books
and
he
vanished
as
quickly
as
he
came
back
to
your
books
said
his
uncle
grimly
hum
i
wish
you
would
see
here
ben
he
put
a
controlling
hand
on
the
boy
shoulder
one
word
with
you
marching
him
into
the
private
office
of
the
firm
do
you
follow
pickering
too
closely
my
boy
he
said
abruptly
he
a
good
lad
in
the
main
but
if
he
is
my
nephew
i
must
give
you
warning
he
losing
ground
ben
lifted
his
head
in
sudden
alarm
oh
i
hope
not
sir
he
said
it
a
fact
master
nelson
says
he
could
be
first
scholar
in
the
grammar
but
for
the
last
six
months
he
failed
steadily
there
no
particular
reason
only
ambition
gone
and
when
you
say
that
you
mean
there
a
general
collapse
of
all
my
hopes
concerning
him
oh
no
sir
ben
kept
on
protesting
his
ruddy
cheek
losing
its
color
he
take
hold
by
and
by
and
give
a
pull
at
his
books
again
it
is
a
pull
now
and
then
that
gets
a
man
up
hill
observed
cabot
leaning
back
in
his
revolving
chair
to
look
into
the
blue
eyes
that
you
know
as
well
as
i
now
ben
i
not
going
to
see
you
throw
away
your
prospects
too
do
let
him
influence
you
in
the
wrong
way
he
bright
and
attractive
but
do
pay
attention
to
his
ridicule
of
good
things
i
a
mother
said
ben
proudly
and
i
do
believe
any
boy
could
say
much
to
me
that
i
think
of
twice
if
she
did
like
it
you
always
tell
her
everything
do
you
ben
asked
cabot
with
a
curious
glance
i
should
think
so
sir
said
ben
with
a
short
laugh
you
do
then
said
cabot
bringing
his
palm
down
on
a
pile
of
unread
letters
awaiting
him
go
ahead
i
do
promise
anything
but
i
will
say
this
if
you
work
on
as
you
have
done
these
two
years
since
you
came
in
here
as
errand
boy
ben
i
make
you
a
power
in
the
house
understand
i
do
expect
you
to
do
brilliant
things
that
in
your
line
you
will
be
a
success
only
as
a
steady
faithful
worker
but
keep
at
it
and
hang
on
to
cabot
van
meter
and
we
hang
on
to
you
xiv
mamsie
wedding
polly
said
fisher
coming
suddenly
out
of
a
corner
of
the
library
as
she
ran
around
the
portiere
folds
you
are
sure
you
are
willing
are
willing
it
should
go
on
the
little
man
peered
at
her
anxiously
through
his
big
glasses
and
he
looked
so
exactly
as
he
did
on
that
morning
so
long
ago
when
eyes
were
at
their
worst
that
she
could
do
nothing
but
gaze
speechlessly
into
his
face
i
see
you
do
consider
it
quite
best
child
said
the
little
doctor
brokenly
but
you
are
trying
with
your
good
heart
to
make
it
so
do
be
afraid
it
is
not
too
late
to
end
it
all
i
was
thinking
cried
polly
with
a
gasp
how
good
you
were
to
me
when
you
saved
my
eyes
and
how
you
kept
joel
from
dying
of
the
measles
oh
i
could
speak
but
i
love
you
so
she
threw
her
young
arms
around
him
papa
fisher
for
you
are
almost
my
father
now
i
am
the
very
very
happiest
girl
because
you
are
going
to
live
here
and
now
i
can
show
you
just
how
much
i
really
and
truly
love
you
the
little
man
beamed
at
her
then
he
took
off
his
spectacles
wiped
them
and
clapped
them
into
place
again
you
see
polly
he
said
deliberately
it
was
impossible
to
see
your
mother
and
not
love
her
she
has
had
well
there
child
i
can
not
bear
to
talk
about
it
and
he
walked
to
the
window
blew
his
nose
violently
on
an
immense
leaving
the
words
poised
in
it
was
the
greatest
trial
of
my
life
that
i
could
show
her
then
when
she
was
struggling
so
bravely
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
how
i
felt
but
my
hands
were
tied
child
he
added
coming
back
his
usual
self
again
now
i
can
make
her
she
says
happy
that
is
if
you
children
like
it
just
think
polly
she
said
happy
it
stupendous
but
she
said
so
polly
she
really
did
he
folded
his
hands
and
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
behind
which
shone
an
intense
gratification
that
lighted
up
his
plain
little
face
till
he
seemed
to
grow
younger
every
instant
indeed
she
did
repeated
polly
like
a
bird
and
laughing
merrily
oh
papa
fisher
you
ought
to
hear
mamsie
sing
she
does
know
hearing
her
but
she
sings
at
her
work
now
does
she
cried
the
doctor
radiantly
well
polly
we
must
see
that
she
sings
every
day
after
this
yes
let
us
cried
polly
clasping
his
hand
we
will
and
proceeded
the
doctor
after
the
wedding
is
over
i
it
really
dread
the
wedding
polly
but
after
that
is
over
i
do
believe
we
shall
all
be
comfortable
together
polly
gave
a
little
cry
of
delight
then
she
said
you
need
dread
the
wedding
one
bit
papa
fisher
there
will
be
only
the
people
that
we
love
and
who
love
us
grandpapa
promised
that
but
that
will
make
it
very
big
said
fisher
with
round
eyes
and
a
small
shiver
he
could
not
suppress
oh
no
said
polly
cheerily
friends
that
all
we
are
going
to
ask
mamsie
and
i
made
out
the
list
last
night
people
exclaimed
fisher
in
dismay
oh
is
is
possible
to
be
married
without
friends
to
stare
at
you
oh
that
not
many
said
polly
is
the
very
smallest
number
that
we
could
manage
we
been
over
the
list
ever
so
many
times
and
struck
out
quantities
of
names
you
see
everybody
loves
mamsie
and
they
want
to
see
her
married
i
know
i
know
assented
the
doctor
but
that
makes
one
hundred
and
thirty
eyes
did
you
ever
think
of
that
polly
polly
burst
into
such
a
laugh
that
jasper
popped
in
and
after
him
phronsie
and
a
general
hilarity
now
reigning
the
dreaded
wedding
preparations
soon
sank
away
from
the
doctor
perturbed
vision
but
they
went
on
merrily
nevertheless
all
over
the
old
stone
mansion
there
were
hints
of
the
festivities
and
though
all
signs
of
it
were
tucked
away
from
the
little
doctor
on
his
occasional
visits
the
smothered
excitement
flamed
afresh
immediately
his
departure
became
an
assured
thing
everybody
had
the
wildest
plans
for
the
occasion
it
appearing
impossible
to
do
enough
for
the
one
who
had
stood
at
the
helm
for
five
long
years
and
who
was
to
be
reigning
housekeeper
for
as
much
longer
as
her
services
were
needed
and
fisher
never
knew
how
perilously
near
he
had
been
to
the
verge
of
brilliant
evening
festivities
in
the
midst
of
which
he
was
to
be
ushered
into
matrimony
for
polly
had
suddenly
waked
one
morning
to
find
herself
not
famous
but
alive
with
the
sense
of
being
as
her
mother
had
so
often
expressed
it
mamsie
little
woman
it
will
be
much
better
to
have
everything
plain
said
polly
communing
with
herself
as
she
turned
on
her
pillow
mamsie
has
always
been
without
show
of
any
kind
and
so
but
here
polly
heart
stood
still
dearly
she
loved
the
bright
conspicuous
accompaniments
to
the
wedding
whereby
king
was
determined
to
show
his
respect
for
the
family
under
his
care
and
her
soul
secretly
longed
for
the
five
hundred
guests
named
on
a
list
of
the
old
gentleman
drawing
up
and
the
feast
and
the
lights
and
the
pretty
dresses
and
the
dancing
party
for
the
young
people
to
follow
for
king
had
announced
himself
as
about
to
usher
in
the
brightest
of
days
for
the
young
peppers
to
remember
besides
it
brings
our
new
physician
into
notice
he
would
answer
when
any
faint
protest
was
made
and
we
shall
all
have
reason
to
be
immensely
proud
of
him
i
tell
you
oh
dear
cried
polly
burrowing
deeper
within
the
pillow
folds
why
are
pleasant
things
best
to
do
why
i
wonder
cherry
twittering
in
the
window
chirped
something
vague
and
unsatisfactory
polly
brought
up
her
brown
head
suddenly
and
laughed
nonsense
our
happiness
does
depend
upon
a
lot
of
people
coming
together
to
help
it
along
mamsie
face
whenever
grandpapa
plans
all
this
magnificence
is
enough
to
make
me
feel
wretched
at
the
thought
of
it
dear
mamsie
she
afraid
of
ingratitude
if
she
does
try
to
like
it
she
shall
have
the
little
morning
wedding
with
a
few
people
around
and
the
gray
silk
gown
instead
of
the
lavender
one
grandpapa
wants
her
to
wear
for
mamsie
always
knows
just
what
is
right
with
that
polly
sprang
out
of
bed
and
rushed
at
her
toilet
and
after
breakfast
she
quietly
captured
king
on
the
edge
of
some
other
extravagant
plan
and
led
him
into
the
library
everything
is
going
on
finely
polly
he
cried
in
elation
ring
for
thomas
child
stay
i
do
it
myself
i
shall
go
in
an
hour
to
give
my
orders
for
the
wedding
supper
grandpapa
cried
polly
turning
quite
pale
and
laying
a
quick
detaining
hand
on
his
arm
oh
do
wait
dear
grandpapa
i
have
something
to
say
well
child
but
he
still
retained
his
hand
on
the
cord
oh
grandpapa
how
could
she
say
it
but
she
must
mamsie
will
be
ever
so
much
happier
if
the
wedding
might
be
a
quiet
one
she
really
would
grandpapa
no
doubt
pepper
finds
it
a
little
hard
to
adjust
her
ideas
to
the
large
affair
said
the
old
gentleman
considerably
disturbed
and
by
no
means
relinquishing
the
but
it
is
due
to
you
children
to
have
a
bright
time
and
i
must
see
that
you
all
have
it
that
is
my
affair
and
this
time
the
cord
was
pulled
and
the
bell
rang
a
loud
insistent
message
polly
stood
still
in
despair
grandpapa
she
said
distinctly
finding
it
hard
to
proceed
with
his
face
before
her
we
children
do
not
want
the
large
party
that
is
i
do
not
it
was
all
out
at
last
stuff
and
nonsense
exclaimed
king
sharply
for
his
surprise
was
too
great
to
allow
of
composure
who
has
been
putting
this
idea
into
your
head
your
mother
could
have
done
it
for
she
promised
it
should
all
be
as
you
young
people
wanted
mamsie
never
said
a
word
cried
polly
recovering
herself
as
she
saw
a
chance
to
make
things
right
for
mother
pepper
it
all
came
to
me
grandpapa
all
alone
by
myself
oh
i
hate
the
big
display
she
declared
with
sudden
vehemence
astonishing
herself
with
the
repulsion
that
now
seized
her
hoity
toity
exclaimed
king
it
not
quite
the
thing
polly
my
child
to
express
yourself
so
decidedly
considering
your
years
grandpapa
cried
polly
with
a
sudden
rush
of
tears
forgive
me
do
i
did
not
mean
to
be
so
naughty
i
did
not
dear
grandpapa
she
looked
like
phronsie
now
and
the
old
gentleman
heart
melted
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
none
of
us
children
would
be
a
bit
happy
not
to
have
it
as
mamsie
would
like
well
but
i
am
not
sure
that
the
others
would
like
it
said
king
persistently
ben
would
said
polly
triumphantly
i
know
for
he
all
along
shrank
from
the
big
party
oh
well
ben
i
suppose
would
object
somewhat
conceded
the
old
gentleman
slowly
and
davie
cried
polly
eagerly
oh
grandpapa
david
would
much
prefer
the
morning
wedding
and
the
plain
things
but
how
about
joel
and
phronsie
interrupted
king
utterly
ignoring
davie
claims
to
be
heard
ah
polly
my
dear
until
you
tell
me
that
they
will
prefer
to
give
up
the
fine
party
you
expect
me
to
pay
any
attention
to
what
you
say
it
due
to
phronsie
that
your
mother
wedding
is
a
thing
worthy
to
remember
as
a
fine
affair
perhaps
joel
and
phronsie
will
think
as
we
do
said
polly
but
her
heart
said
no
all
right
if
they
do
said
king
easily
but
unless
you
come
and
tell
me
it
is
their
own
choice
why
i
shall
just
go
on
with
my
plans
as
mapped
out
he
added
obstinately
thomas
as
that
functionary
appeared
in
the
doorway
take
the
letters
to
the
post
at
once
you
will
find
them
on
my
writing
table
all
right
sir
i
give
you
till
to
find
out
said
king
now
come
and
kiss
me
polly
dear
you
see
it
all
right
after
it
over
and
be
glad
i
had
the
sense
to
keep
my
mind
about
it
polly
put
up
her
lips
obediently
but
it
was
a
sad
little
kiss
that
was
set
upon
his
mouth
and
it
left
him
feeling
like
a
criminal
and
running
out
she
met
her
difficult
task
without
a
moment
of
preparation
halloo
polly
whooped
joel
rushing
around
an
angle
in
the
hall
grandpapa
promised
me
that
i
might
go
out
with
him
to
give
the
supper
orders
and
all
that
kind
of
nonsense
polly
heart
stood
still
joel
she
began
seizing
his
jacket
with
trembling
fingers
come
up
into
my
room
a
minute
what
up
cried
joel
with
curiosity
some
more
mysteries
nothing
but
whisperings
and
secrets
and
no
end
of
jolly
understandings
ever
since
mamsie
commenced
to
marry
fisher
go
ahead
i
come
and
phronsie
too
said
polly
seeing
the
yellow
head
emerge
from
the
doorway
come
on
phron
sang
out
joel
up
in
polly
room
she
wants
you
and
the
three
hurried
off
now
joel
said
polly
closing
the
door
and
facing
him
desperately
you
are
mamsie
own
boy
i
should
think
so
said
joel
i
not
anybody
else
is
that
all
you
brought
me
up
here
to
say
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
looking
at
her
and
you
can
make
her
happy
or
just
as
miserable
as
i
ca
say
what
went
on
polly
incoherently
what
in
the
world
are
you
firing
at
demanded
the
boy
visions
of
certain
pranks
at
school
unpleasantly
before
him
do
shoot
over
my
head
polly
but
keep
somewhere
near
your
mark
he
advised
irritably
phronsie
surveyed
the
two
with
wide
eyes
and
a
not
wholly
pleased
manner
mamsie
does
not
want
a
big
wedding
declared
polly
going
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
but
dear
kind
grandpapa
thinks
it
will
please
us
children
and
so
he
wants
to
give
her
one
and
so
it
will
cried
joel
please
us
children
whoop
la
give
us
your
hand
phronsie
this
is
the
way
we
dance
afterwards
at
the
party
i
do
want
to
dance
said
phronsie
standing
quite
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
morning
sun
shone
across
her
yellow
hair
but
no
light
came
into
the
large
eyes
polly
wants
something
first
what
is
it
joel
i
sure
i
do
know
said
joel
poised
on
a
careless
foot
and
executing
a
remarkable
pas
seul
i
do
believe
she
knows
herself
polly
is
often
queer
you
know
phronsie
he
added
cheerfully
tell
me
polly
do
whispered
phronsie
going
over
to
her
phronsie
said
polly
very
slowly
mamsie
does
want
a
big
party
in
the
evening
to
see
her
married
but
to
have
a
cunning
little
company
of
friends
come
in
the
morning
and
ugh
cried
joel
in
disgust
coming
down
suddenly
to
both
feet
it
will
please
mamsie
best
went
on
polly
with
a
cold
shoulder
to
joel
and
i
never
should
be
happy
in
all
this
world
to
remember
that
i
helped
to
make
my
mamsie
unhappy
on
her
wedding
day
phronsie
shivered
and
her
voice
held
a
miserable
little
thrill
as
she
begged
oh
make
her
be
married
just
as
she
wants
to
be
polly
do
now
that
what
i
call
mean
cried
joel
in
a
loud
vindictive
tone
back
of
polly
to
work
on
phronsie
feelings
you
ca
make
me
say
i
do
want
mamsie
to
have
a
wedding
splurge
so
there
polly
pepper
polly
preserved
a
dignified
silence
and
presented
her
shoulder
again
to
his
view
you
ca
make
me
say
it
polly
pepper
shouted
joel
shrilly
oh
phronsie
exclaimed
polly
in
a
rapture
throwing
her
arms
around
the
child
mamsie
will
be
so
pleased
you
ca
think
let
us
go
and
tell
her

joel
edging
up
why

to
me

anything
to
say
polly
condescended
to
give
him
without
turning
her
head
come
phronsie
holding
out
her
hand
wait
a
minute
well
what
is
it
polly
hand
now
held
phronsie
but
she
paused
on
the
way
to
the
door
i
guess
i
can
give
up
things
as
well
as
she
can
if
i
know
mamsie
wants
me
to
said
joel
with
a
deeply
injured
manner
mamsie
does
want
any
of
us
to
give
up
anything
unless
we
do
it
as
if
we
were
glad
to
said
polly
for
her
life
she
could
conceal
a
little
scornful
note
in
her
voice
and
joel
winced
miserably
i
i
wish
she
would
have
the
big
party
he
whined
i
thought
you
wanted
it
said
polly
turning
to
him
i
i
do
i
rather
mamsie
would
be
happy
o
dear
do
look
at
me
so
i
not
looking
at
you
so
said
polly
you
acted
just
as
if
you
had
your
heart
set
on
the
party
well
it
is
i
i
if
you
say
party
to
me
again
and
he
faced
her
vindictively
joel
pepper
cried
polly
holding
him
with
her
brown
eyes
do
you
really
mean
that
you
are
glad
to
give
up
that
big
evening
party
and
have
the
little
teeny
one
in
the
morning
yes
said
joel
as
true
as
i
live
and
breathe
i
do
oh
oh
oh
cried
polly
and
seizing
his
arm
she
led
off
in
a
dance
so
much
surpassing
his
efforts
that
phronsie
screamed
with
delight
to
see
them
go
when
they
could
dance
no
more
polly
flushed
and
panting
ran
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
two
to
find
out
as
best
they
might
the
cause
of
the
strange
demeanor
grandpapa
polly
rushing
over
the
stairs
met
him
coming
up
to
whitney
room
joel
says
it
the
little
morning
wedding
please
and
phronsie
too
the
old
gentleman
gave
no
sign
of
his
defeat
beyond
a
humph
and
so
i
beaten
after
all
and
fisher
never
knew
all
this
mamsie
at
last
it
came
was
any
other
ever
so
bright
and
beautiful
phronsie
thought
not
and
thereupon
she
impeded
the
preparations
by
running
up
to
kiss
her
mother
every
few
moments
until
such
time
as
felicie
carried
her
off
to
induct
her
into
a
white
muslin
gown
polly
here
there
and
everywhere
was
in
such
a
rapture
that
she
seemed
to
float
on
wings
while
the
boys
of
the
household
with
the
exception
of
jasper
lost
their
heads
early
in
the
day
and
helplessly
succumbed
to
all
demands
upon
them
every
flower
had
to
be
put
in
place
by
the
young
people
old
turner
for
once
stood
one
side
and
polly
must
put
the
white
satin
boxes
filled
with
wedding
cake
on
the
little
table
where
one
of
the
waiters
would
hand
them
to
departing
guests
and
phronsie
must
fasten
mamsie
pearl
broach
the
gift
of
the
five
little
peppers
in
her
lace
collar
the
very
last
thing
and
jasper
collected
the
rice
and
set
the
basket
holding
it
safely
away
from
joel
eager
fingers
till
such
time
as
they
could
shower
the
bride
carriage
and
all
the
boys
were
ushers
even
little
dick
coming
up
grandly
to
offer
his
arm
to
the
tallest
guest
as
it
happened
and
old
king
gave
the
bride
away
and
fisher
at
the
last
forgot
all
the
one
hundred
and
thirty
eyes
and
his
i
will
rang
out
like
a
man
who
has
secured
what
he
has
long
wanted
and
ever
so
many
of
the
guests
said
what
a
good
father
he
will
make
the
children
and
several
attempted
to
tell
the
peppers
so
as
if
we
did
know
it
before
said
joel
indignantly
and
alexia
and
all
the
other
girls
of
polly
set
were
there
and
joel
little
blue
and
white
creature
came
to
his
great
satisfaction
with
her
aunt
who
was
quite
intimate
in
the
family
and
pickering
dodge
was
there
of
course
and
the
alstynes
and
hosts
of
others
and
mother
pepper
in
her
gown
and
bonnet
by
the
side
of
her
husband
with
phronsie
clinging
to
one
hand
heard
nothing
but
wishes
for
her
happiness
and
that
of
the
five
little
peppers
and
there
was
not
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
a
skeleton
at
the
wedding
breakfast
and
cousin
mason
whitney
took
charge
of
the
toasts
and
everybody
felt
that
just
the
right
things
had
been
said
and
then
there
was
a
flutter
of
departure
of
the
bridal
party
and
in
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
phronsie
piped
out
bravely
as
she
threw
the
slipper
after
the
departing
coach
mamsie
has
been
taking
care
of
us
all
these
years
now
we
going
to
be
good
and
let
her
be
happy
xv
chatterton
has
a
new
plan
polly
is
learning
to
play
beautifully
mused
phronsie
nursing
one
foot
contemplatively
as
she
curled
up
on
the
floor
and
ben
is
to
be
a
capital
business
man
so
papa
fisher
says
and
joel
is
going
to
buy
up
this
whole
town
sometime
and
davie
knows
ever
so
many
books
from
beginning
to
end
but
what
can
i
do
down
went
the
little
foot
to
the
floor
and
the
yellow
head
drooped
over
the
white
apron
nothing
mourned
phronsie
just
nothing
at
all
not
even
the
teeniest
bit
of
anything
do
i
know
how
to
do
o
dear
outside
jasper
was
calling
to
prince
phronsie
could
hear
the
big
dog
rushing
over
the
lawn
in
response
barking
furiously
as
he
went
but
she
did
not
move
and
mamsie
will
never
be
glad
for
me
unless
i
learn
how
to
do
things
too
if
i
do
hurry
i
shall
never
be
grown
up

cherry
in
his
cage
over
her
head
chirped
vigorously
by
way
of
consolation
but
phronsie
did
not
lift
her
head
cherry
seeing
all
his
efforts
in
vain
stopped
his
song
and
rolled
one
black
eye
down
at
her
in
astonishment
and
soon
became
quite
still
presently
the
rustle
of
a
stiff
black
satin
gown
became
the
chief
intruder
upon
the
silence
it
was
so
asserting
that
phronsie
lifted
her
head
to
look
into
the
face
of
chatterton
standing
before
her
playing
with
the
rings
on
her
long
white
hands
and
regarding
her
as
if
she
would
soon
require
an
explanation
of
such
strange
conduct
what
are
you
doing
phronsie
at
last
demanded
the
lady
thinking
said
phronsie
and
she
laid
her
chin
in
her
hand
and
slowly
turned
her
gaze
upon
the
thin
disagreeable
face
before
her
but
not
as
if
in
the
slightest
degree
given
up
to
a
study
of
its
lines
and
expression
so
i
perceive
said
chatterton
harshly
well
and
what
are
you
thinking
of
pray
tell
still
phronsie
looked
beyond
her
and
it
was
not
until
the
question
had
been
repeated
that
an
answer
came
of
many
things
said
phronsie
but
i
do
not
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
and
why
not
pray
cried
the
lady
with
a
short
and
most
unpleasant
laugh
because
i
do
not
think
you
would
understand
them
said
phronsie
and
now
she
looked
at
the
face
she
had
before
overlooked
with
a
deliberate
scrutiny
as
if
she
would
not
need
to
repeat
the
attention
indeed
exclaimed
chatterton
angrily
and
pray
how
long
since
your
thoughts
have
been
so
valuable
my
thoughts
are
nice
ones
said
phronsie
slowly
because
they
are
about
nice
people
ah
and
they
wo
tell
themselves
and
i
ought
not
to
make
them
they
would
fly
away
then
and
i
should
never
find
them
again
when
i
wanted
to
think
them
your
mother
brought
you
up
well
i
must
say
observed
chatterton
deliberately
drawing
up
a
chair
and
putting
her
long
figure
within
it
to
talk
in
this
style
to
a
lady
as
old
as
i
am
phronsie
allowed
one
foot
to
gently
trace
the
pattern
on
the
carpet
before
she
answered
i
know
you
are
very
old
she
said
at
last
but
i
can
not
tell
my
thoughts
to
you
very
old
cried
chatterton
her
chin
in
the
air
indeed
well
i
am
not
i
would
have
you
know
miss
phronsie
and
she
played
with
the
silk
cord
of
her
satin
wrapper
i
hate
a
child
that
is
made
a
prig
she
added
explosively
under
her
breath
phronsie
made
no
reply
being
already
deep
in
her
own
calculations
once
more
now
phronsie
said
chatterton
suddenly
drawing
herself
out
of
her
angry
fit
and
clearing
her
brow
i
want
you
to
give
your
attention
to
me
a
moment
for
i
have
something
i
must
say
to
you
that
why
i
came
in
here
to
find
you
alone
come
look
at
me
child
it
is
polite
to
be
staring
at
the
carpet
all
the
time
phronsie
thus
admonished
took
her
gaze
from
the
floor
to
bestow
it
on
the
face
above
her
it
something
that
nobody
is
to
know
but
just
you
and
me
began
chatterton
with
a
cautious
glance
at
the
door
then
she
got
out
of
her
chair
and
going
across
the
room
closed
it
carefully
there
that
better
polly
is
always
around
now
we
are
quite
alone
coming
back
to
her
seat
you
see
phronsie
she
proceeded
not
caring
that
the
brown
eyes
were
slowly
adding
to
their
astonishment
an
expression
that
augured
ill
for
any
plans
she
might
be
hoping
to
carry
out
toward
propitiation
it
is
necessary
to
be
careful
not
to
be
overheard
for
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
must
be
kept
quite
secret
i
must
tell
mamsie
said
phronsie
distinctly
indeed
you
will
not
declared
chatterton
she
is
the
very
one
of
all
others
who
ought
not
to
know
you
can
help
her
phronsie
if
you
only
keep
quiet
phronsie
eyes
now
became
so
very
large
that
chatterton
hastened
to
add
you
know
polly
is
learning
to
be
a
music
teacher
when
she
grows
up
phronsie
made
no
reply
and
a
very
creditable
one
she
will
be
from
all
acounts
i
can
gather
contributed
chatterton
carelessly
well
ben
is
doing
well
in
cabot
van
meter
so
he
no
trouble
to
your
mother
as
for
the
two
boys
i
know
nothing
about
them
one
way
or
the
other
but
you
as
you
are
a
girl
and
the
only
one
not
provided
for
why
i
shall
show
a
little
kindness
in
your
direction
it
wholly
disinterested
and
quixotic
i
know
added
chatterton
with
a
sweeping
gaze
at
the
walls
and
ceilings
for
me
to
give
myself
a
thought
about
you
or
your
future
and
i
shall
never
receive
so
much
as
a
thank
you
for
it
but
i
passed
all
my
life
in
thinking
of
others
phronsie
here
she
brought
down
her
attention
to
the
absorbed
little
countenance
and
i
can
not
change
now
she
finished
pensively
a
silence
fell
upon
them
so
great
that
chatterton
broke
it
nervously
goodness
me
phronsie
you
are
not
like
a
child
you
are
too
uncanny
for
anything
why
do
you
ask
questions
about
my
secret
because
i
ought
not
to
know
it
said
phronsie
finding
her
tongue
have
i
told
you
that
you
will
help
your
mother
only
by
not
telling
her
said
chatterton
how
would
you
like
to
learn
how
to
take
care
of
yourself
when
you
are
a
big
girl
a
light
slowly
gathered
in
the
brown
eyes
becoming
at
last
so
joyous
and
assured
that
chatterton
face
dropped
its
hard
lines
to
lose
itself
in
a
gratified
smile
now
you
make
me
see
some
real
hope
that
my
scheme
wo
be
wholly
a
wild
piece
of
philanthropy
she
exclaimed
only
look
like
that
phronsie
and
i
do
anything
for
you
if
i
can
do
anything
for
mamsie
cried
phronsie
clasping
her
hands
in
rapture
oh
do
tell
me
dear
chatterton
she
pleaded
oh
now
i
am
dear
chatterton
cried
that
lady
with
a
hard
smile
but
she
lowered
her
tone
to
a
gentler
one
and
extending
one
jeweled
hand
took
the
little
folded
ones
in
her
clasp
i
will
be
a
good
friend
to
you
and
show
you
how
you
can
learn
to
do
something
so
that
when
you
grow
up
you
can
take
care
of
yourself
just
as
polly
will
just
think
phronsie
just
as
polly
will
cried
chatterton
artfully
how
how
demanded
phronsie
scarcely
breathing
listen
phronsie
now
you
know
i
have
any
little
girl
phronsie
drew
a
long
breath
well
i
have
been
looking
for
one
for
a
long
time
i
want
one
who
will
be
a
daughter
to
me
who
will
grow
up
under
my
direction
and
who
will
appreciate
what
i
sacrifice
in
taking
her
she
must
be
for
i
could
stand
an
child
i
have
found
several
who
were
much
better
looking
than
you
phronsie
in
fact
they
were
beauties
but
i
do
like
the
attitude
of
their
families
the
poor
things
actually
thought
they
were
doing
me
a
favor
by
accepting
my
proposition
for
the
children
as
this
statement
required
no
remark
on
the
part
of
the
hearer
phronsie
was
silent
not
removing
her
eyes
from
chatterton
face
now
although
you
have
as
much
to
recommend
you
as
many
other
children
that
i
have
fancied
i
hope
to
make
you
serve
my
purpose
i
am
going
to
try
you
at
least
every
day
phronsie
you
can
come
to
my
room
it
lucky
that
you
do
go
to
school
but
do
pretty
much
as
you
like
in
this
house
so
no
questions
will
be
asked
i
go
to
grandpapa
room
every
day
said
phronsie
in
a
distressed
tone
to
my
lessons
of
course
i
know
that
a
very
silly
thing
it
is
too
there
no
use
in
trying
to
break
it
up
now
i
suppose
or
i
put
my
hand
to
the
attempt
but
you
can
come
to
me
after
you
got
through
toadying
mr
king
what
is
toding
asked
phronsie
never
mind
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
business
in
hand
replied
chatterton
impatiently
now
if
you
come
to
me
every
day
and
give
me
as
much
time
as
you
can
why
i
show
you
what
i
want
of
you
and
teach
you
many
things
then
after
a
while
phronsie
when
you
learn
to
appreciate
it
i
shall
tell
you
what
i
am
going
to
do
the
adoption
will
be
an
easy
matter
i
fancy
when
the
child
is
interested
she
added
taking
the
precaution
to
mutter
it
you
must
do
everything
as
i
tell
you
chatterton
leaned
forward
and
said
with
great
deliberateness
else
you
will
lose
this
chance
to
help
your
mother
and
you
will
never
have
another
like
it
but
will
grow
up
to
be
a
little
thing
when
polly
and
all
the
rest
are
earning
money
for
your
mamsie
as
you
call
her
i
shall
earn
money
too
declared
phronsie
on
a
high
note
and
nodding
her
yellow
head
with
great
decision
never
chatterton
brought
her
foot
incased
in
its
black
satin
slipper
down
with
force
on
the
carpet
you
will
never
earn
a
cent
of
money
in
all
this
world
unless
you
do
exactly
as
i
say
for
you
are
a
child
who
has
it
in
her
to
learn
anything
but
you
can
help
me
and
i
shall
teach
you
many
things
and
do
well
by
you
when
i
grow
a
big
girl
will
anybody
want
me
to
do
those
things
that
you
are
going
to
teach
me
asked
phronsie
drawing
near
to
lay
her
hand
on
the
stiff
black
gown
and
speaking
earnestly
then
if
they
will
i
try
to
do
them
just
exactly
as
you
tell
me
of
course
they
will
declared
chatterton
carefully
edging
off
from
the
little
fingers
ever
so
many
people
will
want
you
phronsie
and
i
shall
give
you
a
great
deal
of
money
i
shall
give
it
all
to
mamsie
interrupted
phronsie
her
brown
eyes
dilating
quickly
every
single
cents
you
give
me
then
i
guess
she
will
be
glad
do
you
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
in
sudden
rapture
while
she
began
to
dance
up
and
down
i
shall
give
you
so
many
cents
cried
chatterton
beginning
to
feel
her
old
heart
beat
with
more
enthusiasm
than
she
had
known
for
many
a
day
that
you
will
be
very
rich
phronsie
cried
phronsie
coming
to
an
abrupt
pause
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
her
cheek
paling
in
excitement
and
then
she
could
say
no
more
but
you
must
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
chatterton
leaned
forward
suddenly
and
seized
the
little
hands
now
so
still
in
their
delight
remember
it
is
only
when
you
follow
my
commands
in
every
single
thing
that
you
will
have
any
chance
of
earning
all
this
money
for
your
mother
and
helping
her
just
at
polly
is
going
to
do
remember
now
phronsie
i
will
remember
said
phronsie
slowly
as
her
hands
were
released
very
good
we
will
begin
now
then
chatterton
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
drew
a
long
breath
lucky
i
found
the
child
alone
and
so
tractable
it
singularly
good
fortune
she
muttered
well
aloud
with
a
light
laugh
now
phronsie
if
you
are
going
to
be
your
mother
helper
why
this
is
your
first
duty
let
us
see
how
well
you
perform
it
run
upstairs
to
the
closet
out
of
the
and
open
the
little
black
box
on
the
shelf
in
front
of
the
door
the
box
locked
and
bring
me
the
roll
of
black
velvet
ribbon
you
will
find
there
phronsie
was
about
to
ask
why
does
not
hortense
go
up
for
it
but
chatterton
forestalled
the
question
by
saying
with
a
frown
hortense
has
gone
down
to
the
dressmaker
no
child
who
calls
me
to
account
for
anything
i
ask
of
her
can
be
helped
by
me
do
as
you
like
phronsie
no
one
will
compel
you
to
learn
how
to
do
things
so
that
you
can
be
a
comfort
to
your
mother
only
remember
if
you
do
obey
me
you
will
lose
your
only
chance
after
this
speech
chatterton
sat
back
and
played
with
her
rings
looking
with
oblique
glances
of
cold
consideration
at
the
child
i
go
said
phronsie
with
a
long
sigh
and
do
every
thing
you
say
i
do
really
believe
i
can
bend
one
of
those
dreadful
pepper
children
to
my
will
thought
chatterton
exultingly
she
is
my
only
hope
polly
does
better
than
she
did
but
she
is
too
old
to
be
tractable
and
she
has
a
shrewd
head
on
her
practical
body
and
the
others
are
just
horrible
she
gave
a
shiver
but
phronsie
will
grow
up
to
fit
my
purpose
i
think
three
purposes
i
may
say
to
get
the
peppers
gradually
out
from
under
horatio
king
influence
and
to
train
up
a
girl
to
wait
on
me
so
that
i
can
get
away
from
these
french
villains
of
maids
and
to
spite
alexander
daughter
by
finally
adopting
this
phronsie
if
she
suits
me
but
i
must
move
carefully
the
first
thing
is
to
get
the
child
fastened
to
me
by
her
own
will
phronsie
ascending
the
stairs
to
the
with
careful
deliberateness
found
no
hint
of
joy
at
the
prospect
before
her
reaching
into
the
dim
distance
to
that
enchanted
time
when
she
should
be
grown
up
but
there
was
a
strangely
new
sense
of
responsibility
born
in
an
hour
and
an
acceptance
of
life
burdens
that
made
her
feel
very
old
and
wise
i
shall
be
a
comfort
to
my
mother
she
said
confidently
and
mounted
on
xvi
where
is
phronsie
phronsie
shut
the
door
of
the
and
with
a
great
sigh
realized
that
she
had
with
her
own
hand
cut
herself
off
from
the
gay
life
below
stairs
but
they
are
not
so
very
far
off
she
said
and
i
shall
soon
be
down
again
as
she
made
her
way
across
the
room
and
opened
the
closet
door
a
little
mouse
scurried
along
the
shelf
and
dropped
to
the
floor
phronsie
peered
into
the
darkness
within
her
small
heart
beating
fearfully
as
she
held
the
knob
in
her
hand
there
may
be
more
she
said
irresolutely
i
suppose
he
would
live
up
here
all
alone
please
go
away
mousie
and
let
me
get
the
box
for
answer
there
was
a
scratching
and
nibbling
down
in
the
corner
that
held
more
terrors
for
the
anxious
ears
than
an
invading
army
i
must
go
in
said
phronsie
and
bring
out
the
box
please
good
mouse
go
away
for
one
moment
then
you
may
come
back
and
stay
all
day
but
the
shadowy
corner
only
gave
back
the
renewed
efforts
of
the
sharp
little
teeth
so
at
last
phronsie
plucking
up
courage
stepped
in
the
door
swung
to
after
her
giving
out
a
little
click
unnoticed
in
her
trepidation
as
she
picked
her
way
carefully
along
holding
her
red
gown
away
from
any
chance
nibbles
it
was
a
low
narrow
closet
unlighted
save
by
a
narrow
latticed
window
in
the
ceiling
for
the
most
part
filled
with
two
lines
of
shelves
running
along
the
side
and
one
end
phronsie
caught
her
breath
as
she
went
in
the
air
was
so
confined
and
stumbling
over
in
the
dim
light
put
her
hand
on
the
box
desired
a
small
black
affair
easily
found
as
it
was
the
only
one
there
i
will
take
it
out
into
the
then
i
can
get
the
velvet
roll
and
gathering
it
up
within
her
arms
she
speedily
made
her
way
back
to
the
door
why
another
pull
at
the
knob
but
with
the
same
result
and
phronsie
setting
the
box
on
the
floor
still
with
thoughts
only
of
the
mouse
put
both
hands
to
the
task
of
opening
the
door
it
sticks
i
suppose
because
no
one
comes
up
here
only
once
in
a
great
while
she
said
in
a
puzzled
way
i
ought
to
be
able
to
pull
it
open
i
sure
for
i
am
so
big
and
strong
she
exerted
all
her
strength
till
her
face
was
like
a
rose
the
door
was
fast
phronsie
turned
a
despairing
look
upon
the
shadowy
corner
please
do
bite
me
she
said
the
large
tears
gathering
in
her
brown
eyes
i
am
locked
in
here
in
your
house
but
i
did
want
to
come
and
i
wo
do
anything
to
hurt
you
if
you
let
me
sit
down
and
wait
till
somebody
comes
to
let
me
out
meanwhile
chatterton
shook
out
her
black
satin
gown
complacently
and
with
a
satisfied
backward
glance
at
the
mirror
sailed
off
to
her
own
apartments
madame
exclaimed
hortense
breathlessly
meeting
her
within
the
door
de
modiste
will
not
send
de
gown
you
must
will
not
send
it
repeated
her
mistress
in
a
passion
a
pretty
message
to
deliver
go
back
and
get
it
at
once
she
say
de
drapery
de
tournure
all
wrong
and
she
must
try
it
on
again
said
the
maid
glad
to
be
defiant
since
the
dressmaker
supported
her
what
utter
nonsense
yet
i
suppose
i
must
go
or
the
silly
creature
will
have
it
ruined
take
off
this
gown
hortense
and
bring
my
walking
suit
then
ring
and
say
i
like
to
have
thomas
take
me
down
there
at
once
and
throwing
off
her
bracelets
and
the
various
buckles
and
pins
that
confined
her
laces
she
rapidly
disrobed
and
was
expeditiously
inducted
by
hortense
into
her
walking
apparel
and
a
parlor
maid
announcing
that
thomas
with
the
coupe
was
at
the
door
she
hurried
downstairs
with
no
thought
for
anything
beyond
a
hasty
last
charge
to
her
maid
where
phronsie
cried
polly
rushing
into
mother
fisher
room
o
dear
me
my
hair
wo
stay
straight
pushing
the
rebellious
waves
out
of
her
eyes
it
looks
as
if
a
brush
would
do
it
any
harm
observed
mother
fisher
critically
o
dear
dear
well
i
brushed
and
brushed
but
it
does
no
good
said
polly
running
over
to
the
mirror
some
days
mamsie
no
matter
what
i
do
it
flies
all
ways
good
work
tells
generally
said
her
mother
pausing
on
her
way
to
the
closet
for
a
closer
inspection
of
her
and
her
head
you
have
taken
as
much
pains
polly
lately
with
your
hair
that
is
the
trouble
well
i
always
in
such
a
hurry
mourned
polly
brushing
furiously
on
the
refractory
locks
there
will
you
stay
down
to
a
particularly
rebellious
wave
one
at
a
time
is
the
best
way
to
take
things
said
fisher
dryly
when
you
dress
yourself
polly
i
put
my
mind
on
that
if
i
were
you
with
that
she
disappeared
within
the
closet
o
dear
i
suppose
so
sighed
polly
left
to
her
own
reflections
and
brushing
away
well
that
the
best
i
can
make
it
look
now
for
i
ca
do
the
braid
over
where
is
phronsie
i
wonder
mamsie
she
threw
down
the
brush
and
ran
over
to
put
her
head
in
the
closet
where
did
she
go
i
told
her
she
might
run
over
to
helen
fargo
right
after
breakfast
said
fisher
her
head
over
a
trunk
from
which
she
was
taking
summer
dresses
polly
i
think
you
get
one
more
wear
out
of
this
pink
cambric
oh
i
am
so
glad
cried
polly
for
i
had
such
splendidly
good
times
in
it
with
a
fond
glance
at
the
pink
folds
and
ruffles
well
if
phronsie
is
over
at
helen
there
no
use
in
asking
her
to
go
down
town
with
us
where
are
you
going
asked
fisher
extricating
one
of
white
gowns
from
its
winter
imprisonment
down
to
candace
said
polly
jasper
wants
some
more
pins
for
his
cabinet
no
i
do
suppose
phronsie
would
tear
herself
away
from
helen
for
all
the
in
the
world
you
would
better
let
her
stay
where
she
is
advised
mother
fisher
she
has
been
over
to
helen
for
quite
a
while
so
it
a
pity
to
call
her
away
and
she
turned
to
her
unpacking
again
while
polly
ran
off
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
in
a
tremor
at
having
kept
jasper
waiting
so
long
candace
was
the
widow
of
an
old
colored
servant
of
king
she
called
herself
a
relict
that
and
the
pride
in
her
little
shop
made
her
hold
her
turbaned
head
high
in
the
air
while
a
perennial
smile
enwreathed
her
round
face
the
shop
was
on
temple
place
a
narrow
extension
thrown
out
from
one
of
the
city
thoroughfares
she
was
known
for
a
few
specialties
such
as
big
sugary
doughnuts
that
appealed
alike
to
old
and
young
they
were
always
fresh
and
sweet
with
just
the
proper
amount
of
spice
to
make
them
toothsome
and
she
made
holders
of
various
descriptions
with
the
most
elaborate
patterns
wrought
always
in
yellow
worsted
with
several
other
things
that
the
ladies
protested
could
never
be
found
elsewhere
jasper
had
been
accustomed
to
run
down
to
candace
little
shop
since
pinafore
days
when
he
had
been
taken
there
by
his
nurse
and
set
upon
a
high
stool
before
the
small
counter
and
plied
with
dainties
by
the
delighted
candace
the
first
thing
i
can
remember
he
had
often
told
polly
is
candace
taking
out
huge
red
and
white
peppermint
drops
from
the
big
glass
jar
in
the
window
and
telling
me
to
hold
out
both
hands
and
after
the
pinafore
days
were
over
candace
was
the
boy
helper
in
all
his
sports
where
a
woman
needle
could
stitch
him
out
of
any
difficulty
she
it
was
who
made
the
sails
to
his
boats
and
marvelous
skate
bags
she
embroidered
the
most
intricate
of
straps
for
his
and
once
she
horrified
him
completely
by
working
in
red
cotton
large
j
on
two
handkerchiefs
he
stifled
the
horror
when
he
saw
her
delight
in
presenting
the
gift
and
afterwards
was
careful
to
remember
to
carry
a
handkerchief
occasionally
when
on
an
errand
to
the
shop
latterly
candace
was
occupied
in
preparing
pins
for
jasper
cabinet
out
of
old
needles
that
had
lost
their
eyes
she
cleverly
put
on
red
and
black
sealing
wax
heads
turning
them
out
as
round
as
the
skillful
manipulation
of
deft
fingers
could
make
them
in
this
new
employment
the
boy
kept
her
well
occupied
many
thereby
finding
their
way
into
her
little
till
i
wish
phronsie
had
come
said
polly
as
she
and
jasper
sorted
the
pins
in
the
little
wooden
tray
candace
kept
for
the
purpose
how
many
red
ones
you
will
have
jasper
see
fifteen
well
they
prettier
than
the
others
ef
little
miss
had
come
wid
you
said
candace
emerging
from
the
folds
of
a
chintz
curtain
that
divided
the
shop
from
the
bedroom
she
seen
my
doll
i
made
for
her
land
but
it
a
beauty
oh
candace
exclaimed
polly
dropping
the
big
pin
she
held
and
allowing
it
to
roll
off
the
counter
to
the
floor
what
a
pity
we
did
bring
her
do
let
us
see
the
doll
she
a
perfec
beauty
repeated
candace
in
satisfaction
an
i
done
made
her
all
myself
fer
de
little
miss
and
she
dodged
behind
the
curtain
again
this
time
bringing
out
a
large
rag
doll
with
surprising
black
bead
eyes
a
generous
crop
of
wool
on
its
head
and
a
red
worsted
mouth
dat
my
own
hair
said
candace
pointing
to
the
doll
head
with
pride
so
i
know
it
good
an
ai
dat
mouf
pretty
oh
candace
exclaimed
polly
seizing
the
doll
and
skillfully
evading
the
question
what
a
lovely
dress
and
the
apron
is
a
dear
ai
it
said
candace
her
black
face
aglow
with
delight

ruffled
like
to
kill
an
made
tambour
work
polly
had
already
heard
many
times
the
story
of
madame
so
she
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
doll
beauty
as
a
desirable
change
do

want
us
to
take
this
to

she
asked

candace
in

but

vulgar
eyes

the
king

the
maid
interrupting
what

phronsie

whirled
around
on
the
step
and
looked
at

hannah

hannah

and
dustpan
that
she
had
set
in
a
convenient
corner
as
proof
of
her
statement
well
she
with

in
bewilderment
mamsie
said
she
told
phronsie
right
after
breakfast
that
she
could
come

said
the
maid
positively
i
know

sure

mary
has
she
jane
appealing
to
another
maid
coming
down
the
hall
no
said
jane
she

many

jasper
quickly
anyway
she
home
now
come
on
polly
she
run
out
to
meet
us
oh
jasper
do
you
suppose
she
will
cried
polly
unable
to
stifle
an
undefinable
dread
she
was
running
now
on
frightened
feet
jasper
having
hard
work
to
keep
up
with
her
and
the
two
dashed
through
the
little
gate
in
the
hedge
where
phronsie
was
accustomed
to
let
herself
through
on
the
only
walk
she
was
ever
allowed
to
take
alone
and
into
the
house
where
polly
cried
to
the
first
person
she
met
phronsie
to
be
met
with
what
she
dreaded
gone
over
to
helen
fargo
and
now
there
was
indeed
alarm
through
the
big
house
not
knowing
where
to
look
each
fell
in
the
other
way
quite
as
much
concerned
for
king
for
the
old
gentleman
was
reduced
to
such
a
state
by
the
fright
that
the
entire
household
had
all
they
could
do
to
keep
him
in
bounds
madame
is
not
to
come
home
to
luncheon
announced
hortense
to
whitney
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
she
told
me
to
tell
you
that
de
mees
taylor
met
her
at
de
modiste
and
took
her
home
with
her
whitney
made
no
reply
but
raised
her
eyes
swollen
with
much
crying
to
the
maid
face
hortense
run
as
quickly
as
possible
down
to
fisher
office
and
tell
him
to
come
home
thomas
should
be
sent
said
hortense
with
a
toss
of
her
head
not
de
work
for
me
beside
i
am
madame
maid
do
you
go
at
once
commanded
whitney
with
a
light
in
her
blue
eyes
that
the
maid
never
remembered
seeing
she
was
even
guilty
of
stamping
her
pretty
foot
in
the
exigency
and
hortense
slowly
gathered
herself
up
i
will
go
madame
with
the
air
of
conferring
a
great
favor
only
i
do
not
such
again
xvii
phronsie
is
found
i
am
glad
that
you
agree
with
me
chatterton
bestowed
a
complacent
smile
upon
the
company
but
we
do
in
the
least
agree
with
you
said
madame
dyce
her
stiff
brocade
rustling
impatiently
in
the
effort
to
put
her
declaration
before
the
others
not
in
the
least
ah
well
you
must
allow
that
i
have
good
opportunities
to
judge
the
pepper
entanglement
can
be
explained
only
by
saying
that
my
mental
faculties
are
impaired
the
rest
of
the
family
are
afflicted
in
the
same
way
are
they
remarked
hamilton
dyce
nonchalantly
humph
yes
chatterton
still
shapely
shoulders
allowed
themselves
a
shrug
intended
to
reveal
volumes
what
jasper
horatio
king
believes
the
rest
of
the
household
accept
as
law
and
gospel
but
it
no
less
infatuation
i
not
hear
one
word
involving
those
dear
peppers
cried
madame
dyce
if
i
could
i
have
them
in
my
house
and
it
a
most
unrighteous
piece
of
work
in
my
opinion
to
endeavor
to
arouse
prejudice
against
them
it
goes
quite
to
my
heart
to
remember
their
struggles
all
those
years
chatterton
turned
on
her
with
venom
was
all
the
world
arrayed
against
her
to
take
up
with
those
hateful
interlopers
in
her
home
she
made
another
effort
i
should
have
credited
you
with
more
penetration
into
motives
than
to
allow
yourself
to
be
deceived
by
such
a
woman
as
mrs
pepper
do
give
her
the
name
that
belongs
to
her
i
believe
she
fisher
is
she
drawled
livingston
bayley
a
budding
youth
with
a
moustache
that
occasioned
him
much
thought
and
a
solitary
eyeglass
stuff
and
nonsense
yes
what
an
absurd
thing
that
wedding
was
did
anybody
ever
hear
or
see
the
like
chatterton
lifted
her
long
jeweled
hands
in
derision
but
as
no
one
joined
in
the
laugh
she
dropped
them
slowly
into
her
lap
i
do
see
any
food
for
scorn
in
that
episode
said
the
youth
with
the
moustache
possibly
there
will
be
another
marriage
there
before
many
years
i
sweet
on
polly
chatterton
face
held
nothing
but
blank
dismay
the
rest
shouted
you
need
laugh
you
people
said
the
youth
setting
his
eyeglass
straight
that
girl
is
going
to
make
a
sensation
i
tell
you
when
she
comes
out
i
going
to
secure
her
early
not

preferences
laughed
hamilton
dyce
aside
to
miss
mary
is
possible
that
she
could
be
anything
but
fascinated
of
course
mary
laughed
back
of
course
not
the
callow
youth
knows
his
power
anybody
else
in
favor
of
the
peppers
aloud
and
looking
at
the
company
do
ask
us
if
we
like
the
peppers
cried
two
young
ladies
simultaneously
they
are
our
especial
and
particular
pets
every
one
of
them
the
peppers
win
said
hamilton
dyce
looking
full
into
chatterton
contemptuous
face
i
glad
to
record
my
humble
self
as
their
admirer
now
well
pa
mary
could
not
refrain
from
interrupting
as
her
father
suddenly
appeared
in
the
doorway
i
ca
sit
down
he
said
as
the
company
made
way
for
him
to
join
them
i
came
home
for
some
important
papers
i
suppose
you
have
heard
the
trouble
at
the
kings
i
happened
to
drop
in
there
well
dyce
laying
his
hand
on
that
gentleman
chair
i
scarcely
expected
to
see
you
here
why
are
you
at
the
club
spread
cousin
horatio
i
suppose
he
had
a
paralytic
attack
interrupted
chatterton
with
her
most
sagacious
air
what
the
trouble
up
there
queried
dyce
ignoring
the
question
thrust
at
him
it
the
little
beauty
phronsie
said
taylor
nothing
happened
to
that
child
i
hope
cried
madame
dyce
paling
now
taylor
you
are
not
going
to
harrow
our
feelings
by
telling
us
anything
has
harmed
that
lovely
creature
exclaimed
the
two
young
ladies
excitedly
phronsie
ca
be
found
said
taylor
ca
be
found
echoed
all
the
voices
except
chatterton
she
ejaculated
ridiculous
hamilton
dyce
sprang
to
his
feet
and
threw
down
his
napkin
excuse
me
miss
taylor
come
bayley
now
is
the
time
to
show
our
devotion
to
the
family
let
us
go
and
help
them
out
of
this
young
bayley
jumped
lightly
up
and
stroked
his
moustache
like
a
man
of
affairs
all
right
dyce
bon
jour
ladies
how
easily
a
scene
is
gotten
up
said
chatterton
over
a
naughty
little
runaway
i
wish
some
of
the
poor
people
in
this
town
could
have
a
tithe
of
the
attention
that
is
wasted
on
these
peppers
she
added
virtuously
madame
dyce
turned
uneasily
in
her
seat
and
played
with
the
almonds
on
her
plate
i
think
we
do
best
to
reserve
our
judgments
she
said
coolly
i
do
believe
phronsie
has
run
away
of
course
she
has
asserted
chatterton
in
that
positive
way
that
made
everybody
hate
her
to
begin
with
she
was
all
right
this
morning
when
i
left
home
where
else
is
she
if
she
has
run
away
pray
tell
not
being
able
to
answer
this
no
one
attempted
it
and
the
meal
ended
in
an
uncomfortable
silence
driving
home
a
later
in
a
cab
summoned
for
that
purpose
chatterton
threw
off
her
things
angry
not
to
find
hortense
at
her
post
in
the
where
she
had
been
told
to
finish
a
piece
of
sewing
and
not
caring
to
encounter
any
of
the
family
in
their
present
excitement
she
determined
to
take
herself
off
upstairs
where
i
can
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
get
rid
of
everybody
and
find
my
box
myself
because
of
course
that
child
ran
away
before
she
got
it
so
she
mounted
the
stairs
laboriously
counting
herself
lucky
indeed
in
finding
the
upper
part
of
the
house
quite
deserted
and
shutting
the
door
when
she
was
well
within
it
she
proceeded
to
open
the
door
of
the
closet
hortense
did
tell
me
there
was
a
spring
lock
on
this
door
she
exclaimed
with
an
impatient
pull
oh
good
heavens
she
had
nearly
stumbled
over
phronsie
pepper
little
body
lying
just
where
it
fell
when
hope
was
lost
i
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
repeated
chatterton
to
herself
following
king
and
jasper
as
they
bore
phronsie
downstairs
her
yellow
hair
floating
from
the
pallid
little
face
goodness
i
have
had
such
a
shock
in
years
my
heart
is
going
quite
wildly
the
child
probably
went
up
there
for
something
else
i
am
not
supposed
to
know
anything
about
it
is
she
dead
cried
dick
summoned
with
the
rest
of
the
household
by
chatterton
loud
screams
and
quite
beside
himself
he
clambered
up
the
stairs
to
get
in
every
one
way
chatterton
with
an
aimless
thrust
of
her
long
jeweled
hands
pushed
him
one
side
and
dick
boiled
over
at
that
what
are
you
here
for
he
cried
savagely
you
do
love
her
you
would
better
get
out
of
the
way
and
no
one
thought
to
reprove
him
polly
was
clinging
to
the
post
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
shall
die
if
phronsie
is
dead
she
said
then
she
looked
at
mother
fisher
waiting
for
her
baby
give
her
to
me
said
phronsie
mother
holding
out
imperative
arms
you
would
better
let
us
carry
her
well
put
her
in
your
bed
only
get
the
doctor
king
was
almost
harsh
as
he
endeavored
to
pass
her
but
before
the
words
were
over
his
lips
the
mother
held
her
baby
mamsie
cried
polly
creeping
over
to
her
like
a
hurt
little
thing
i
do
believe
but
that
she
be
all
right
god
wo
let
anything
happen
to
our
phronsie
he
could
mamsie
fisher
met
them
at
the
door
polly
never
forgot
the
long
slow
terror
that
clutched
at
her
heart
as
she
scanned
his
face
while
he
took
the
child
out
of
the
arms
that
now
yielded
up
their
burden
and
everything
turned
dark
before
her
eyes
was
phronsie
dead
but
there
was
mamsie
and
polly
caught
her
breath
beat
back
the
faintness
and
helped
to
lay
phronsie
on
the
big
bed
clearly
i
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
chatterton
to
herself
stumbling
into
a
room
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
but
her
face
was
gray
and
she
found
herself
picking
nervously
at
the
folds
of
lace
at
her
throat
the
child
went
up
there
as
all
children
will
to
explore
i
shall
say
nothing
about
it
nothing
whatever
oh
how
is
she
grasping
blindly
at
jasper
as
he
rushed
by
the
door
still
unconscious
stuff
and
oh
well
muttering
on
she
probably
come
to
children
can
bear
a
little
confinement
an
hour
or
two
does
matter
with
them
hortense
aloud
bring
me
my
sal
volatile
dear
me
this
is
telling
on
my
nerves
she
caught
sight
of
her
face
in
the
long
mirror
opposite
and
shivered
to
see
how
ghastly
it
was
where
is
the
girl
hortense
i
say
come
here
this
instant
a
maid
summoned
by
her
cries
put
her
head
in
the
door
had
you
better
go
into
your
own
room
mrs
chatterton
she
said
in
pity
at
the
shaking
figure
and
blanched
face
no
no
she
sharply
repulsed
her
bring
hortense
where
is
that
girl
she
demanded
passionately
she
crying
said
the
maid
her
own
eyes
filling
with
tears
help
you
to
your
room
crying
madame
chatterton
shrieked
she
paid
to
take
care
of
me
what
right
has
she
to
think
of
anything
else
she
says
she
was
cross
to
phronsie
once
though
i
do
see
how
she
could
be
and
and
now
that
she
going
to
die
she
and
the
maid
burst
into
tears
and
threw
her
apron
over
her
face
die
she
sha
what
utter
nonsense
everybody
does
talk
in
this
house
madame
chatterton
seized
her
arm
the
slender
fingers
tightening
around
the
young
muscles
and
shook
her
fiercely
the
maid
roused
by
her
pain
out
of
her
tears
looked
in
affright
into
the
gray
face
above
her
let
me
go
she
cried
oh
madame
you
hurt
me
give
me
air
said
madame
chatterton
her
fingers
relaxing
and
making
a
great
effort
not
to
fall
help
me
over
to
the
window
and
open
it
girl
and
leaning
heavily
on
the
slight
figure
she
managed
to
get
across
the
room
there
now
drawing
a
heavy
breath
as
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
thrust
her
ashen
face
out
over
the
sill
do
you
go
and
find
out
how
the
child
is
and
come
back
and
tell
me
at
once
madame
i
afraid
to
leave
you
alone
said
the
girl
looking
at
her
afraid
i
not
so
old
but
that
i
can
take
care
of
myself
said
chatterton
with
a
short
laugh
go
and
do
as
i
tell
you
stamping
her
foot
still
unconscious
would
no
one
ever
come
near
her
but
this
detestable
maid
with
her
still
more
detestable
news
chatterton
clutched
the
window
casing
in
her
extremity
not
feeling
the
soft
springy
air
as
she
gasped
for
breath
the
maid
too
frightened
to
leave
her
crept
into
a
corner
where
she
watched
and
cried
softly
there
was
a
stir
in
the
household
that
they
might
have
heard
betokening
the
arrival
of
two
other
doctors
but
no
word
came
and
darkness
settled
upon
the
room
still
the
figure
in
the
window
niche
held
to
its
support
and
still
the
maid
cried
at
her
post
as
the
gray
of
the
twilight
settled
over
the
old
stone
mansion
phronsie
moved
on
her
pillow
dear
mouse
the
circle
of
watchers
around
the
bed
moved
closer
i
go
away
when
some
one
comes
to
open
the
door
hush
fisher
put
his
hand
over
the
mother
lips
do
please
bite
me
very
hard
i
wo
come
up
again
to
your
house
oh
where
grandpapa
old
king
put
his
head
on
his
hands
and
sobbed
aloud
the
little
white
face
moved
uneasily
grandpapa
always
comes
when
i
want
him
in
piteous
tones
father
said
jasper
laying
a
hand
on
the
bowed
shoulders
you
would
better
come
out
we
call
you
when
she
comes
to
herself
but
king
gave
no
sign
of
hearing
a
ticked
slowly
away
and
phronsie
spoke
again
it
growing
dark
and
i
suppose
they
will
never
come
dear
mouse
the
words
died
away
and
she
seemed
to
sleep
i
shall
not
tell
chatterton
was
saying
to
herself
in
the
other
room
what
good
could
it
do
oh
this
vile
air
is
stifling
will
no
one
come
to
say
she
is
better
and
so
the
night
wore
on
as
morning
broke
phronsie
opened
her
eyes
and
gave
a
weak
little
cry
polly
sprang
from
her
knees
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
staggered
toward
the
child
do
cried
jasper
with
a
hand
on
her
arm
let
her
alone
said
fisher
quickly
oh
polly
phronsie
raised
herself
convulsively
on
the
bed
you
did
come
you
did
winding
her
little
arms
around
polly
neck

the
mouse

phronsie
straining
to
get

further
into
polly
arms

close
just
as
long
as
you

and
he

king
getting
out
of
the
large
into
which
they
had
persuaded
him
do
do
it
stay
where
you
are
said
fisher
stopping
him
across
the
room
but
phronsie
wants
me
she
said
so
exclaimed
old
king
hoarsely
and
trying
to
push
his
way
past
the
doctor
why
man
do
stop
me
fisher
planted
his
small
body
firmly
in
front
of
the
old
gentleman
you
must
obey
me
obey
when
had
king
heard
that
word
addressed
to
himself
he
drew
a
long
breath
looked
full
into
the
spectacled
eyes
then
said
all
right
fisher
i
suppose
you
know
best
and
went
back
to
his
i
so
tired
polly
phronsie
was
saying
and
the
arms
polly
could
feel
were
dropping
slowly
from
her

tuck
under

and
she
crept
on
to
the
bed
and
we
both
go
right
to
do

know
you
sure

wo
let
me

whispered
phronsie
cuddling
close
and
feeling
for
polly
neck
again
oh
just
as
sure
as
i
can
be
declared
polly
cheerfully
while
the
tears
rained
down
her
cheek
in
the
darkness
i
feel
something
wet
said
phronsie
drawing
back
one
hand
what
is
it
polly
oh

said
polly
with
a
start
oh

i
crying
phronsie
but
i
so

and
she
leaned
over
and
kissed
her

phronsie
weakly
i
do
care
but
please

if

polly
as
gaily
as

phronsie
polly
could
feel
her
tucking
the
other
hand
under
her
cheek
on
the
pillow
and
then
blessed
sound
the
long
quiet
breathing
that
told
of
rest
oh
better

she
chatterton
looked
up
quickly
to
see
whitney
pale
face
well
i
supposed
she
would
be
i
thought
i
sit
here
and
wait
to
know
since
you
were
all
so
frightened
but
i
knew
it
would
amount
to
much
now
girl
nodding
over
to
the
maid
still
in
the
corner
you
may
get
me
to
bed
and
she
stretched
her
stiff
limbs
and
held
out
her
hand
imperatively
it
was
very
fortunate
that
i
did
not
tell
she
said
when
the
slow
passage
to
her
own
apartments
had
been
achieved
now
if
the
child
will
only
keep
still
all
will
be
well

the
others

their
partners
and
whirling

polly
when
amy
garrett
turned
away
from

piano
and
declared
she

and
she
still
pirouetted
on
one
foot
to

a
rose
to
the
group

at
polly

lot
of
pills
and
stuff
now
that
fisher
is
your
father
polly
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
merrily
it
sounded
so
strangely
to
her
to
hear
the
sound
echoing
through
the
room
so
long
silent
that
she
stopped
suddenly
oh
girls
i
ca
hardly
believe
even
yet
that
phronsie

sallow
face
that

fourteen
summers
i
sometimes

as
much
as
a
few
other
people
of
my
acquaintance
she
said
pointedly
i
did
say
but
that

alexia

with
a
pout
she
always

polly
with
a
gay
little
laugh
she

to
her
but
we

and
she
ran
over
seized
the
tall
girl
by
the
waist
and
spun
her
around
till
she
begged
to
stop
is
that
your
way
of
making
up
cried
cathie
when
she
had
the
breath
to
speak
yes
it
is
as
good
as
any
other
way
it
spins
the
nonsense
out
of
you
there
with
a
last
pat
on
the
thin
shoulder
she
left
her
and
ran
back
to
polly
it
all
done
she
cried
i
at
peace
with
the
whole
world
now
do
look
like
an
ogre
any
longer
phronsie
actually
hungry
now
all
the
time
confided
polly
in
a
glow
and
we
ca

enough
to
satisfy
her
good

cried
the
girls
i
going
to
send
her
some
of
my
orange
jelly
declared
alexia
make
it
just
as
soon
as
i
go
home
do
you
think
she
will
like
it
polly
she
asked
anxiously
yes
i
do
believe
she
will
said
polly
because
she
loves
oranges
so
well
i
sha
make
any
old
orange
jelly
cried
cathie
her
nose
in
the
air
faugh
it
insipid
enough
but
is
when
it
made
the
way
alexia
makes
it
said
polly
viewing
in
alarm
the
widening
of
the
breach
between
the
two
eaten
some
of
hers
and
it
too
splendid
for
anything
i
do
know
anything
about
hers
but
all
orange
jelly
i
have
tasted
is
just
horrid
i
hate
it
i
going
to
make
almond
macaroons
lovely
polly
oh
do
cathie
begged
polly
in
distress
why
not
pray
tell
whirling
on
one
set
of
toes
you
need
be
afraid
they
wo
be
good
i
made
them
thousands
of
times
but
she
could
eat
them
said
polly
just
think
almond
macaroons
why
would
now
i
know
the
doctor
makes
you
take
perfectly
terrible
things
and
wo
let
you
eat
anything
and
macaroons
are
the
only
things
i
can
make
it
a
shame
and
down
sat
cathie
in
despair
on
an
ottoman
what
the
matter
fisher
put
his
head
in
at
the
doorway
his
spectacled
eyes
sending
a
swift
glance
of
inquiry
around
o
dear
me
exclaimed
cathie
in
a
fright
jumping
up
and
clutching
the
arm
of
the
girl
next
to
her
do
let
polly
tell
him
what
i
said
do
polly
wo
tell
said
the
girl
with
a
superb
air
do
you
know
any
better
cathie
harrison
you
goose
you
to
be
called
a
goose
by
two
persons
in
the
course
of
an
hour
was
too
much
for
cathie
endurance
and
flinging
off
the
girl
arm
she
cried
out
passionately
i
wo
stay
i
going
home
and
rushed
out
the
door
fisher
turned
from
a
deliberate
look
at
the
girl
white
cheeks
as
she
ran
past
to
the
flushed
ones
before
him
i
very
sorry
that
anything
unpleasant
has
happened
i
dropped
in
to
tell
you
of
a
little
surprise
but
i
see
it
no
time
now
oh
cried
polly
flying
up
to
him
from
the
center
of
the
group
it
was
nothing
only
a
girl
quarrel
is
not
a
slight
thing
polly
said
little
fisher
gravely
and
one
of
your
friends
has
gone
away
very
unhappy
oh
i
know
it
said
polly
and
i
so
sorry
we
ca
any
of
us
help
it
said
alexia
quickly
cathie
harrison
has
the
temper
of
a
gorilla
so
there
dr
fisher
fisher
set
his
spectacles
straight
and
looked
at
alexia
but
he
did
not
even
smile
as
she
hoped
he
would
do
i
ca
help
it
she
said
tracing
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
with
the
toe
of
her
boot
she
makes
us
all
so
uncomfortable
oh
you
ca
think
and
i
wish
stay
home
forever
still
no
answer
from
the
doctor
he
did
act
as
if
he
heard
but
bowing
gravely
he
withdrew
his
head
and
shut
the
door
o
dear
dear
cried
alexia
when
they
had
all
looked
at
each
other
a
breathing
space
why
did
he
speak
i
much
rather
he
scold
like
everything
than
to
look
like
that
polly
why
do
you
say
something
because
there
is
anything
to
say
polly
got
no
further
and
turned
away
suspiciously
near
to
tears
was
this
the
first
meeting
with
the
girls
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
so
long
to
think
of
that
cathie
harrison
making
such
a
breeze
cried
alexia
angrily
a
girl
who
just
come
among
us
as
it
were
and
we
only
let
her
in
our
set
because
miss
salisbury
asked
us
to
make
things
pleasant
for
her
if
it
had
been
any
one
else
who
raised
such
a
fuss
meantime
fisher
strode
out
to
the
west
porch
intending
to
walk
down
to
his
office
and
buttoning
up
his
coat
as
he
went
along
as
he
turned
the
angle
in
the
drive
he
came
suddenly
upon
a
girl
who
had
thrown
herself
down
on
a
rustic
seat
under
a
tree
and
whose
shoulders
were
shaking
so
violently
that
he
knew
she
was
sobbing
though
he
heard
no
sound
do
cry
said
the
little
doctor
and
what
the
matter
all
in
the
same
breath
and
sitting
down
beside
her
cathie
looked
up
with
a
gasp
and
then
crushed
her
handkerchief
over
her
eyes
those
girls
in
there
are
perfectly
horrid
softly
softly
said
fisher
i
ca
help
it
no
matter
what
i
say
they
call
me
names
and
tired
of
it
o
dear
dear
now
see
here
said
the
doctor
getting
up
on
his
feet
and
drawing
a
long
breath
i
on
my
way
to
my
office
suppose
you
walk
along
with
me
a
bit
and
tell
me
all
about
it
cathie
opened
her
mouth
intending
to
say
oh
i
ca
instead
she
found
herself
silent
and
not
knowing
how
she
was
presently
pacing
down
the
drive
by
the
doctor
side
polly
pepper
exclaimed
alexia
as
a
turn
in
the
drive
brought
the
two
figures
in
view
of
the
windows
did
you
ever
see
such
a
sight
in
your
life
cathie
is
walking
off
with
fisher
there
anything
her
tongue
wo
say
did
you
tell
polly
cried
jasper
a
later
putting
his
head
into
fisher
office
oh
beg
pardon
i
did
know
you
were
busy
sir
come
in
said
the
doctor
folding
up
some
powders
methodically
no
i
did
tell
polly
oh
said
jasper
in
a
disappointed
tone
i
had
a
fair
chance
but
she
ought
to
know
it
just
as
soon
as
it
talked
of
said
jasper
fidgeting
at
a
case
of
little
vials
on
the
table
oh
beg
pardon
again
i
afraid
i
smashed
that
chap
as
one
rolled
off
to
the
floor
i
no
end
sorry
picking
up
the
bits
ruefully
i
have
several
like
it
said
the
doctor
kindly
and
settling
another
powder
in
its
little
paper
there
were
a
lot
of
girls
with
polly
when
i
looked
in
upon
her
on
my
way
out
but
we
catch
a
chance
to
tell
her
soon
my
boy
oh
i
suppose
so
a
lot
of
giggling
creatures
how
polly
can
stand
their
chatter
i
do
see
cried
jasper
impatiently
they
been
shut
off
from
polly
for
some
time
you
know
said
fisher
quietly
we
must
remember
that
polly
does
like
some
of
them
a
bit
better
than
i
do
said
jasper
explosively
only
she
puts
up
with
their
nonsense
it
rather
a
difficult
matter
to
pick
and
choose
girls
who
are
in
the
same
classes
said
the
doctor
and
polly
sees
that
do
i
know
it
exclaimed
jasper
in
an
astonished
tone
dear
me
fisher
i
watched
polly
for
years
now
and
she
always
done
so
he
stopped
whirling
the
articles
on
the
office
table
and
bestowed
a
look
on
the
little
physician
softly
softly
jasper
said
fisher
composedly
of
course
used
your
eyes
now
do
spoil
things
by
saying
anything
but
let
polly
her
own
gait
i
beg
of
you
then
he
turned
to
his
powders
once
more
she
will
anyway
declared
jasper
whatever
she
makes
up
her
mind
to
do
polly
does
that
very
thing
not
a
bad
characteristic
laughed
the
doctor
i
should
say
not
now
when
i
come
up
home
for
dinner
you
and
i
will
find
polly
and
tell
her
the
good
news
if
she
with
a
lot
of
those
silly
girls
i
i
tear
her
off
this
time
fisher
glared
so
fiercely
as
he
declared
this
determination
that
jasper
laughed
outright
i
thought
no
one
was
to
disturb
polly
good
intentions
in
that
line
he
cried
well
there
an
end
to
all
things
and
patience
ceases
to
be
a
virtue
sometimes
so
i
thought
a
good
many
times
but
i
borne
it
like
a
man
jasper
drew
himself
up
and
laughed
again
at
the
doctor
face
oh
you
go
along
cried
fisher
his
eyes
twinkling
i
meet
you
just
before
dinner
all
right
as
jasper
rushed
off
fisher
jumped
to
his
feet
pushing
aside
the
litter
of
powder
papers
and
bottles
and
ran
his
fingers
through
the
shock
of
gray
hair
standing
straight
on
his
head
yes
yes
he
muttered
walking
to
the
window
it
will
be
a
good
thing
for
polly
now
i
tell
you
adoniram
he
always
preferred
to
address
himself
by
his
first
name
then
he
was
sure
of
a
listener
a
vastly
good
thing
it
quite
time
that
some
of
the
intimacies
with
these
silly
creatures
are
broken
up
a
bit
while
the
child
gains
immensely
in
other
ways
he
rubbed
his
palms
gleefully
oh
a
patient
walking
in
looked
up
at
the
jolly
little
doctor
i
wish
i
could
laugh
like
that
he
ejaculated
his
long
face
working
in
the
unusual
effort
to
achieve
a
smile
you
would
if
you
had
a
gay
crowd
of
children
such
as
i
have
cried
the
little
doctor
proudly
why
man
that
better
than
all
my
doses
but
i
have
the
children
said
the
patient
sourly
and
sitting
down
with
a
sigh
i
pity
you
then
said
fisher
with
the
air
of
having
been
a
family
man
for
years
well
besides
owning
the
peppers
i
going
off
with
them
to
there
he
stopped
for
before
he
knew
it
the
secret
was
out
xix
phronsie
is
well
again
but
polly
was
not
to
be
told
yet
when
papa
fisher
walked
in
to
dinner
the
merry
party
around
the
oak
table
were
waiting
over
the
ices
and
coffee
for
his
appearance
oh
papa
fisher
cried
polly
in
dismay
turning
from
one
of
sallies
and
dropping
her
spoon
now
you
all
tired
out
too
bad
mother
fisher
flushed
up
and
set
her
lips
closely
together
ben
looked
disapproval
across
the
board
and
polly
knew
that
the
wrong
thing
had
been
said
oh
i
did
mean
of
course
you
must
take
care
of
the
sick
people
she
said
impulsively
yes
i
must
said
fisher
wearily
and
pushing
up
the
shock
of
gray
hair
to
a
stiffer
brush
over
his
brow
that
what
i
set
out
to
do
i
believe
but
that
no
reason
why
you
should
tire
yourself
to
death
and
break
down
the
first
year
said
king
eyeing
him
sharply
zounds
man
that
is
what
i
brought
you
up
from
the
country
for
fisher
looked
into
his
wife
eyes
and
smiled
i
believe
you
brought
me
the
smile
said
but
he
kept
his
tongue
still
and
you
must
get
accustomed
to
seeing
suffering
that
you
ca
help
why
man
alive
the
town
full
of
it
you
ca
expect
to
stop
it
alone
i
do
what
i
can
to
help
said
the
little
doctor
between
his
teeth
and
taking
a
long
draught
of
the
coffee
his
wife
put
by
his
plate
i
suppose
there
no
objection
to
that
now
that
good
smacking
his
lips
in
a
pleased
way
of
course
not
if
you
help
in
the
right
way
said
old
king
stoutly
but
i
wager
anything
that
you
picking
up
all
sorts
of
odd
jobs
among
the
poor
that
belong
to
the
young
doctors
your
place
is
considerably
higher
where
you
can
pick
and
choose
your
patients
fisher
laughed
an
odd
little
laugh
that
along
with
its
pleasant
note
carried
the
ring
of
a
strong
will
oh
well
you
know
i
too
old
to
learn
new
ways
he
said
better
let
me
wag
on
at
the
old
ones
king
gave
an
exclamation
of
disapproval
it
lucky
your
time
is
short
he
said
grimly
and
the
secret

nearly
out

coming
downstairs

she
asked
jasper
quickly
over
to
the
doctor
oh

i
think

answered
king
before
fisher
had
time
to
reply
she
would
better
wait
a
day
or
two
longer
is
that
so
doctor
at
last
appealing
to
him
i
do
agree
with
you
the
little
doctor
drew
off
his
attention
from
his
plate
you
see
she
has
regained
her
strength
remarkably
now
the
quicker
she
is
in
the
family
life
again
the
better
for
her

cried
polly
delighted
at
the
safe
withdrawal
from
the
precipice
of
dangerous
argument
alexia
now
you
must
help
us
think
up
something
to
celebrate
her
coming
downstairs
not
so
fast
polly
the
little
doctor
beamed
at
her
in
a
way
surprising
to
see
after
the
morning
affair
phronsie
wo
be
ready
for
any
celebration
before
next
week
then
i
think
you
may

alexia
pouted
and
played

dick
dolefully

a
whole
week
pray
tell
because
father
fisher
says
so
replied
ben
across
the
table
the
principal
reason

it
does
need
any
more
to
support
it
well
i
tell
you
broke
in
polly
in
her
brightest
way
let
us
think
up
perfectly
splendid
things
it
best
as
it

a
week

cried
whitney
in
the
way
of
a
doll

why

of
those
phonograph
dolls
to
be
sure
cried
king
promptly
are

on
sale
yet
asked
jasper
i
thought
they
had
not
perfected
them
enough
for
the
market
i
think
i
know
where
one
can
be
bought
said
his
father
they
must
be

all
nonsense
that

ca

one
if
phronsie
wants
it
yes
she
shall

a
phonograph
doll
that
will
be
perfectly
elegant
exclaimed
polly
with
sparkling
eyes
wo
phronsie
be
delighted
when
she
hears
it
talk
she
ought
to
have
a
punch
and
judy
show
said
whitney
always
so
pleased
with
them
father
king
pushed
away
his
and
pulled
out
his
and
judy
down
that
goes
he
said
noting
it
after
phonograph
doll
what
else
ca
we
have
some
of
those
boys
up
from
the
orphan
asylum
asked
polly
after
a
minute
in
which
everybody
had
done
a
bit
of
hard
thinking
phronsie
loves
to
hear
them
sing
when
she
goes
there
oh
they
are
so
cunning
she
want
to
give
them
her
best
toys
and
load
them
down
with
all
her
possessions
you
see
if
she
does
warned
jasper
well
she
wo

away
her
new
doll
anyway
cried
polly
no
she
never
gives
away
one
of
the
dolls
you
given
her
father
said
whitney
slowly
not
a
single
one
i
tried
her
one
day
asking
her
to
give
me
one
to
bestow
on
a
poor
child
and
she
quite
reproached
me
by
the
look
in
her
brown
eyes
i
have
asked
her
since
what
did
she
say
asked
king
abruptly
ca
auntie
dear
grandpapa
gave
them
to
me
himself
then
she
ran
for
her
savings
bank
and
poured
out
the
money
in
my
lap
go
out
and
buy
the
poor
child
a
doll
she
begged
and
i
really
had
to
do
it
and
there
must
be
at
least
two
hundred
dolls
in
this
house
two
hundred
dolls
cried
alexia
in
astonishment
and
raising
her
hands
why
yes
father
has
been
bringing
phronsie
dolls
for
the
last
five
years
with
the
greatest
faithfulness
till
her
family
has
increased
to
a
painful
extent
o
dear
me
cried
alexia
with
great
emphasis
i
should
think
be
under
foot
in
every
room
well
indeed
they
not
said
polly
she
keeps
them
up
in
her
playroom
and
the
playroom
closet
said
whitney
that
is
full
i
peeped
in
there
yesterday
and
the
dolls
are
ranged
according
to
the
times
when
father
gave
them
to
her
and
the
is
just
crowded
laughed
jasper
i
know
because
i
saw
her
moving
out
her
chairs
and
tables
to
make
room
o
dear
me
exclaimed
alexia
again
for
want
of
something
else
to
say
i
just
hate
dolls
exploded
dick
faugh
how
can
girls
play
with
them
they
so
silly
and
phronsie
always
has
something
to
do
for
hers
so
she
ca
come
when
i
want
her
to
i
wish
they
were
burned
up
he
added
vindictively
king
rubbed
his
forehead
in
a
puzzled
way
perhaps
she
has
enough
he
said
at
last
yet
what
shall
i
give
her
if
i
do
buy
a
doll
i
give
her
the
phonograph
one
father
said
whitney
anyway
yes
of
course
but
after
that
what
shall
i
do
he
looked
so
troubled
that
whitney
hastened
to
say
oh
well
father
you
know
when
you
are
abr
and
the
secret
was
nearly
out
for
the
second
time
but
they
were
saved
by
the
appearance
of
alexia
father
who
often
dropped
in
on
the
edge
of
the
dinner
hour
for
a
second
cup
of
coffee
the
next
morning
phronsie
was
waiting
for
grandpapa
king
who
insisted
that
no
one
else
should
carry
her
downstairs
the
remainder
of
the
household
in
various
stages
of
delight
and
expectation
revolving
around
her
and
curbing
their
impatience
as
best
they
might
in
hall
and
on
staircase
oh
grandpapa
do
hurry
begged
dick
kicking
his
heels
on
the
stairs
hush
dicky

said
mamma

announced
polly
gleefully
from
a
station
nearer
the
library
hush
now
frazer
going
the
library
door
opening
at
this
announcement
and
a
few
sentences
charged
with
business
floating
up
the
staircase
the
bustle
around
phronsie
became
joyfully
intense
mamsie
do
you
think
she
ought
to
have
a
shawl
on
cried
polly
anxiously
running
over
the
stairs
she
been
shut
up
so
long
no
said
mother
fisher
doctor
told
me
particularly
not
to
bundle
her
up
it
was
the
last
thing
he
said
before
he
went
to
his
office
well
said
polly
with
a
sigh
then
there
is
absolutely
anything
more
to
do
for
her
why
does
grandpapa
come
you
are
worse
than
dicky
said
fisher
with
a
little
laugh
dear
me
polly
just
think
how
old
you
are
phronsie
stood
quite
still
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
folded
her
hands
i
want
to
see
grandpapa
all
alone
when
he
comes
up
she
said
what
for
cried
polly
pausing
in
astonishment
do
you
want
us
all
to
go
out
phronsie
asked
her
mother
slowly
yes
said
phronsie
shaking
her
yellow
head
with
great
decision
please
every
single
one
go
out
mamsie
i
want
to
see
grandpapa
quite
alone
all
right
child
said
fisher
with
a
look
at
polly
so
after
a
little
demur
and
consequent
delay
on
the
part
of
the
others
the
door
was
closed
and
she
was
left
standing
all
alone
phronsie
drew
a
long
breath
i
wish
grandpapa
would
come
she
said
to
herself
and
so
you
wanted
me
did
you
dear
cried
king
joyfully
as
he
hurried
in
and
closed
the
door
carefully
well
now
see
if
i
can
guess
what
you
want
to
tell
me
grandpapa
said
phronsie
standing
quite
still
and
turning
a
puzzled
face
toward
him
i
do
want
to
tell
you
anything
i
want
to
ask
you
something
well
well
dear
what
is
it
old
king
not
stopping
for
a
chair
leaned
over
her
and
stroked
her
yellow
head
now
then
look
up
and
ask
me
right
off
phronsie
must
a
person
keep
a
promise
asked
phronsie
a
really
and
truly
promise
grandpapa
yes
yes
said
the
old
gentleman
with
great
abruptness
to
be
sure
one
must
phronsie
to
be
sure
so
now
if
any
one
has
promised
you
anything
do
you
make
him
stick
to
it
it
mean
enough
to
break
your
word
child
phronsie
drew
a
long
breath
that
all
grandpapa
she
said
and
lifting
up
her
arms
now
take
me
downstairs
please
she
laid
a
cool
little
cheek
against
his
as
he
raised
her
to
his
shoulder
remember
what
i
say
phronsie
laughed
king
his
mind
more
intent
on
the
delightful
fact
that
he
was
carrying
down
the
burden
to
the
family
life
than
on
what
he
was
saying
and
if
any
one
has
promised
you
anything
keep
him
up
sharp
to
pay
you
i
verily
believe
it
is
that
scamp
dick
here
goes
and
reaching
the
door
he
threw
it
wide
forward
march
well
is
the
important
conference
over
asked
polly
with
a
keen
look
at
them
both
fisher
eyes

their
duty

she
said
nothing
yes

declared
king
marching
on
gaily
now
clear
the
way
there

dick

racing
down
the
remainder
of
the

halloo
phronsie
waving
his
hand
at
her
three
cheers
and
a
tiger
bother
here
comes
mrs
chatterton
which
was
quite
true
to
every
one
astonishment
the
door
of
that
lady
apartment
opened
slowly
disclosing
her
in
new
morning
wrapper
preparing
to
join
the
cavalcade
good

king
gaily
he
could
be

festal
occasion

said
chatterton
coming
slowly
out
into
the
hall
but
i
stand
here
and

the
parade
bully
exploded
dick
softly
peering
up
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
phronsie
looked
over
king
shoulder
at
her
as
she
was
borne
down
the
stairs
and
putting
out
her
hand
i
all
well
now
she
said
yes
i
see
said
chatterton
then
she
pulled
up
her
white
shawl
with
a
shiver
it
rather
cold
here
she
said
after
all
i
believe
i
must
get
back
to
my
room
nobody
noticed
when
she
crept
back
the
hilarity
now
being
so
great
below
stairs
i
certainly
am
losing
ground
she
muttered
every
little
thing
affects
me
so
i
step
into
bartram
office
next
time
i
go
down
town
and
set
that
little
matter
straight
since
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
it
it
never
would
do
to
let
him
come
to
the
house
horatio
would
suspect
something
to

my
mind
phronsie
meanwhile

going
around
from
room
to
room
in
a
pleased
way
and
touching
different
objects
gently
everything
new
is
it
polly
she
said
at

when

in
their
basket
for
alexia
flowers

dick
seizing
her
hand

phronsie
fearfully

back
a
step
at
this
and
tried
to
cover
her
feet
with
her
gown
searching
the
floor
for
the
it
lookout
cried
dick
suddenly
there
he
goes
and
something
whirred
over
phronsie
head

cried
tumbling
into
jasper
arms
and
clasping
his
neck

babel
that

echoed
phronsie
if
he
does
frighten
my
dolls
this
episode
taking
the
family
life
to
the
rear
of
the
house
no
one
noticed
that
soft
footsteps
were
passing
through
the
open
front
door
that
jane
who
was
sweeping
the
vestibule
had
left
ajar
to
run
and
tell
dick
that
she
had
not
let
the
bird
out
of
the
so
the
uninvited
guest
to
the
household
let
himself
up
easily
to
the
scene
of
his
hopes
the
location
of
the
ladies
xx
the
secret
chatterton
standing
by
her
toilet
table
carefully
examining
her
wealth
of
gray
hair
to
note
the
changes
in
its
tint
was
suddenly
surprised
in
the
very
act
of
picking
out
an
obnoxious
white
hair
by
a
slight
noise
in
the
further
corner
of
the
apartment
and
dropping
her
fingers
quickly
and
turning
away
from
the
glass
she
exclaimed
how
dare
you
hortense
come
in
without
knocking
if
you
make
a
noise
i
kill
you
declared
a
man
standing
in
the
shadow
of
a
portiere
and
watching
her
underneath
a
slouched
black
hat
there
was
a
slight
click
that
caused
the
listener
nerves
to
thrill
but
her
varied
life
had
brought
her
nothing
if
not
and
she
coolly
answered
if
you
want
my
money
say
so
not
exactly
money
said
the
man
for
i
do
suppose
you
have
much
here
but
i
thank
you
to
hand
over
that
there
box
of
diamonds
he
extended
the
other
hand
with
its
dingy
fingers
toward
a
large
ebony
elaborate
with
its
brass
hinges
and
suggestive
of
double
locks
on
a
corner
of
the
table
if
you
are
determined
to
take
it
i
suppose
i
must
give
it
to
you
said
chatterton
with
evident
reluctance
handing
the
box
designated
very
glad
to
think
she
had
but
a
few
days
before
changed
the
jewels
to
another
repository
to
escape
hortense
prying
eyes
in
making
the
movement
she
gave
a
sweeping
glance
out
the
window
should
she
dare
to
scream
michael
was
busy
on
the
lawn
she
knew
she
could
hear
his
voice
talking
to
one
of
the
under
gardeners
see
here
old
lady
warned
the
man
you
keep
your
eyes
in
the
room
now
then
his
greedy
glance
fastened
on
the
glittering
gems
on
her
fingers
i
thank
you
to
rip
them
things
off
dick
racing
along
the
further
end
of
the
hall
after
his
bird
with
a
whoop
la
almost
caught
you
startling
him
he
proceeded
to
perform
the
service
for
himself
there
he
goes
cried
dick
in
her
room
bother

i
must
catch
him
so
without
the
preamble
of
knocking
the
boy
dashed
into
the
the
bird
whizzing
ahead
of
him
flashed
between
the
drawn
folds
of
the
portiere
excuse
me
cried
dick
rushing
in
but
my
swallow
oh
go
back
cried
chatterton
hoarsely
you
be
killed
the
bird
flying
over
his
head
and
the
appearance
of
the
boy
disconcerted
the
robber
for
one
instant
he
held
the
long
white
hand
in
his
tearing
off
the
rings
there
was
no
chance
for
her
to
escape
she
knew
but
she
could
save
dick
go
back
she
screamed
again
there
was
only
a
moment
to
think
but
dick
dashed
in
and
with
a
mighty
spirit
but
small
fists
he
flung
himself
against
the
stalwart
arms
and
shoulders
o
heavens
screamed
chatterton
he
but
a
boy
let
him
go
you
shall
have
the
rings
help
help
dick
clutching
and
tearing
blindly
at
whatever
in
the
line
of
hair
or
ragged
garment
he
could
lay
hold
of
was
waging
an
unequal
warfare
but
what
he
did
was
accomplished
finely
and
the
bird
rushing
blindly
into
the
midst
of
the
contention
with
whirrings
and
flappings
indescribable
helped
more
than
an
army
of
servants
to
confuse
the
man
notwithstanding
it
was
soon
over
but
not
before
chatterton
had
wrenched
her
fingers
free
and
grasped
the
pistol
from
its
loose
hold
in
his
other
hand
the
box
under
his
arm
fell
to
the
floor
and
dick
was
just
being
tossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
could
hear
him
strike
the
with
a
dull
thud
i
can
shoot
as
well
as
you
said
chatterton
handling
the
pistol
deftly
make
a
noise
and
i
will
he
knew
it
by
her
eyes
and
that
she
had
taken
good
aim
where
are
you
dick
cried
polly
voice
outside
and
rapping
at
the
door
chatterton
have
you
seen
him
come
in
called
chatterton
with
firmest
of
fingers
on
the
trigger
and
her
flashing
eyes
fastened
upon
the
seamed
dirty
face
before
her
polly
threw
wide
the
door
we
have
a
man
here
that
we
do
want
said
chatterton
take
care
of
him
till
you
get
help

cried
polly
in
a
breath
with
a
fearful
glance
at
the
boy
lying
there
i
think
he
all
right
polly
she
dared
say
no
more
for
dick
had
not
stirred
polly
clasped
her
hands
and
rushed
out
almost
into
jasper
face
a
burglar
a
burglar
and
he
dashed
into
chatterton
room
do
interfere
said
chatterton
i
a
splendid
markswoman

said
the
man
sullenly
i
wo

think

said
the
woman
her
eyes
alight
and
hand
firm
as
a
rock
well
here
are
the
men
jasper
had
seized
a
and
as
michael
and
the
undergardeners
advanced
he
went
back
of
the
robber
and
cleverly
threw
it
over
his
head
it
was
easy
to
secure
and
bind
him
then
polly
rushed
over
to
dick
turn
the
creature
over
and
let
us
see
how
he
looks
said
king
hurrying
in
as
the
last
knot
of
the
rope
was
made
fast
the
old
slouched
hat
had
fallen
off
in
the
struggle
and
the
man
features
came
plainly
to
view
he
no
beauty
and
that
a
fact
i
seen
that
fellow
round
here
for
many
a
day
said
michael
giving
the
recumbent
legs
a
small
kick
oncet
he
axed
me
ef
we
wanted
ony
wourk
done
i
mind
yees
yer
see
with
another
attention
from
his
gardening
boot
i
want
to
tie
one
rope
cried
a
voice
dick
opened
his
eyes
rubbed
them
and
felt
of
his
head
i
all
right
polly
i
saw
stars
but
i
got
over
it
i
guess
let
me
give
him
the
last
knot
he
staggered
blindly
to
his
feet
i
tie
for
you
said
jasper
trust
me
dick
all
right
only
stunned
he
telegraphed
to
the
rapidly
increasing
group
tell
his
mother
so
do
somebody
said
old
king
well
cousin
eunice
you
covered
yourself
with
glory
he
turned
on
her
warmly
she
had
thrown
aside
the
pistol
and
now
sank
into
a
chair
never
mind
she
waved
it
off
carelessly
i
imagine
the
compliments
just
now
i
want
a
glass
of
wine
call
hortense
will
you
the
man
on
the
floor
tried
to
raise
his
head
but
he
could
so
was
obliged
to
content
himself
with
an
ugly
grin
that
bird
has
flown
he
said
i
peep
she
put
me
up
to
it
we
was
goin
shares
on
the
old
lady
stuff
with
that
chatterton
spirit
returned
she
sprang
from
her
chair
and
rushed
around
from
bureau
to
closet
to
see
the
extent
of
her
dishonesty
but
beyond
a
few
minor
deficiencies
of
her
wardrobe
there
was
no
robbery
to
speak
of
evidently
hortense
had
considered
it
unwise
to
be
burdened
with
much
impedimenta
so
the
robber
was
hauled
off
to
justice
and
phronsie
coming
wonderingly
up
the
stairs
came
softly
in
upon
them
in
time
to
see
dick
rush
up
to
chatterton
with
a
you
a
brick
before
them
all
after
that
there
was
no
more
hope
of
keeping
things
quiet
in
the
house
for
phronsie
sake
meanwhile
the
bird
who
had
played
no
mean
part
in
the
engagement
now
asserted
himself
and
blindly
rushed
into
capture
is
he
lovely
cried
phronsie
tearing
her
gaze
off
from
the
wonderful
wings
as
the
swallow
fluttered
under
the
mosquito
netting
speedily
brought
in
yes
his
wings
are
said
polly
oh
dick
do
tell
over
again
how
it
all
happened
so
dick
rehearsed
once
more
as
far
as
he
knew
the
story
tossing
off
lightly
his
part
of
it
your
poor
head
does
it
ache
cried
polly
feeling
of
the
big
bump
on
the
crown
no
not
a
bit
declared
dick
shaking
his
brown
poll
i
glad
i
did
crack
the
glass
that
heavy
plate
cried
polly
looking
over
at
the
with
a
shiver
phronsie
deserted
the
fascinating
bird
and
began
to
smooth
dick
head
with
both
hands
do
let
me
bathe
it
she
begged
i
get
the
pond
extract
no
i
wo
said
dick
it
smells
awfully
and
i
had
so
much
of
it
for
my
leg
i
all
right
phronsie
see
his
wings
now
stretching
but
phronsie
was
not
to
be
diverted
from
her
purpose
i
get
bay
rum
she
said
may
i
dick
made
a
wry
face
worse
and
worse
cologne
then
no
i
hate
it
he
does
want
it
bathed
phronsie
dear
said
polly
boys
like
to
get
hurt
you
know
is
manly
to
be
fixed
up
phronsie
gave
a
sigh
which
so
went
to
dick
heart
that
he
said
all
right
bring
on
some
water
if
you
want
to
but
do
get
any
brown
paper
i
had
enough
of
that
when
i
was
a
boy
and
at
the
end
of
that
exciting
day
the
secret
came
out
after
all
in
rather
a
tame
fashion
fisher
and
jasper
met
polly
in
an
angle
of
the
hall
as
she
was
running
upstairs
after
dinner
for
her
schoolbooks
polly
asked
the
little
doctor
putting
both
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
looking
into
the
brown
eyes
should
you
be
willing
to
go
abroad
with
your
mother
and
phronsie
king
and
jasper
oh
polly
gasped
but
you
came
in
a
later
breath
we
leave
you
she
cried
loyally
well
i
suppose
i
should
go
along
too
said
the
little
doctor
enjoying
her
face
why
jasper
elyot
king
cried
polly
slipping
out
from
under
the
doctor
palms
and
seizing
the
two
hands
extended
she
began
to
spin
around
as
in
the
olden
days
did
you
ever
ever
hear
of
anything
so
perfectly
magnificent
but
ben
and
joel
and
davie
and
she
paused
on
the
edge
of
another
pirouette
fisher
made
haste
to
answer
polly
whitney
will
take
care
of
them
and
jasper
led
her
off
into
the
dance
again
how
can
we
ever
leave
the
boys
oh
i
do
see
cried
polly
a
bit
reproachfully
her
hair
blown
over
her
rosy
cheeks
as
they
danced
lightly
down
the
long
hall
fisher
leaned
against
a
pillar
and
watched
them
have
to
said
jasper
guiding
his
partner
deftly
in
the
intricacies
of
the
chairs
and
statuary
that
a
good
spin
polly
he
said
as
they
brought
up
by
the
little
doctor
side
lovely
said
polly
pushing
back
her
locks
from
the
sparkling
eyes
i
almost
tempted
to
dance
myself
said
fisher
if
i
such
an
old
fellow
i
try
that
is
if
anybody
asked
me
i
will
said
polly
laughing
come
papa
fisher
holding
out
her
hand
do
give
me
the
honor
all
right
said
fisher
bravely
so
jasper
took
the
deserted
post
by
the
pillar
and
whistled
a
strauss
waltz
thereupon
a
most
extraordinary
hopping
up
and
down
the
hall
was
commenced
the
two
figures
bobbing
like
a
pair
of
corks
on
a
quivering
the
doors
opened
and
several
faces
appeared
amongst
the
number
fisher
i
could
help
it
said
the
little
doctor
coming
up
red
and
animated
and
wiping
his
forehead
his
spectacles
had
fallen
off
long
since
and
he
had
let
them
go
it
looked
so
nice
to
see
jasper
and
polly
i
thought
i
try
it
i
did
suppose
i
get
on
so
well
i
really
believe
i
can
dance
humph
laughed
king
it
looks
like
it
just
see
polly
oh
papa
fisher
cried
polly
with
a
merry
peal
in
which
jasper
unpuckering
his
lips
from
the
strauss
effort
had
joined
we
must
have
looked
here
she
went
off
again
yes
said
jasper
you
did
that
just
it
polly
you
did
lucky
you
two
caperers
did
break
anything
well
if
you
got
through
laughing
observed
fisher
remark
that
the
secret
is
out
do
you
like
it
polly
asked
king
holding
out
his
hand
say
my
girl
and
then
before
she
could
answer
he
went
on
you
see
we
do
anything
without
a
doctor
on
our
travels
now
providence
has
given
us
one
though
rather
an
obstinate
specimen
he
pointed
to
father
fisher
and
he
wants
to
see
the
hospitals
and
you
want
to
study
a
bit
of
music
and
your
mother
wants
rest
and
jasper
and
phronsie
and
i
want
fun
so
we
going
that
all
when
demanded
polly
breathlessly
in
a
month
xxi
the
whitneys
little
plan
i
think
it
a
mean
shame
cried
joel
on
a
high
vindictive
key
you
had
burglars
here
twice
and
i
have
been
home
you
speak
as
if
we
appointed
the
meeting
joe
said
ben
with
a
laugh
well

cried
joel
with
a
flash
of
his
black
eyes
now
there
wo
any
come
again
in
an
age
goodness
i
hope
not
ejaculated
king
lowering
his
newspaper
to
peer
over
its
top
i
have
floored
him
declared
joel
striking
out
splendidly
from
the
shoulder
if
i
only
have
been
here
all
very
well
said
percy
negligently
but
you
were
here
and
he
laughed
softly
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
could
have
handled
the
burglar
demanded
joel
belligerently
and
advancing
on
percy
say
because
if
you
do
why
i
try
a
bout
with
you
i
did
say
anything
what
you
could
or
could
do
i
said
you
were
here
and
you
were
that
enough
and
percy
turned
his
back
on
him
thrust
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
morning
jacket
and
stalked
to
the
window
van
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
then
thought
better
of
it
and
gave
a
low
whistle
joel
finding
no
enthusiasm
for
tales
of
his
fighting
prowess
ran
off
to
interview
dick
on
the
old
topic
of
the
burglary
and
to
obtain
another
close
account
of
its
details
to
think
phronsie
saw
the
other
burglar
five
years
ago
and
now
dick
was
on
hand
for
this
one
those
two
babies
he
fumed
and
none
of
us
men
around
percy
said
van
come
out
in
the
hall
will
you
what
do
you
want
asked
percy
lazily
oh
you
come
along
cried
van
laying
hold
of
his
jacket
see
here
dropping
his
voice
cautiously
as
he
towed
him
successfully
out
give
joe
a
chance
to
see
a
burglar
he
wants
to
so
terribly
what
do
you
mean
asked
percy
with
astonished
eyes
his
hands
still
in
his
pockets
van
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
then
stopped
short
it
take
two
of
us
he
whispered
oh
van
exclaimed
percy
and
pulling
his
hands
from
their
resting
places
he
clapped
them
smartly
together
but
we
ought
not
i
really
suppose
he
said
at
last
letting
them
fall
to
his
sides
mamma
might
like
it
you
know
she
would
mind
said
van
yet
he
looked
uneasy
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
every
one
to
take
joe
down
he
does
yarn
so
it
an
old
grudge
with
you
said
percy
pleasantly
you
know
he
beat
you
when
you
were
a
little
fellow
and
he
just
come
as
if
i
cared
for
that
cried
van
in
a
dudgeon
that
was
nothing
i
did
half
try
and
he
went
at
me
like
a
country
yes
i
remember
percy
nodded
placidly
and
you
got
all
worsted
and
knocked
into
a
heap
everybody
knew
it
do
you
suppose
i
pound
a
visitor
cried
van
wrathfully
his
cheeks
aflame
say
percy
whitney
no
i
do
said
percy
not
when
was
joe
that
just
it
he
was
polly
brother
at
mention
of
polly
percy
color
rose
and
he
put
out
his
hand
beg
pardon
van
he
said
here

and
make
up
i
forgot
all
about
our
promise
he
added
penitently
i
forgot
it
too
declared
van
quieting
down
and
thrusting
out
his
brown
palm
to
meet
his
brother
well
i
do
care
what
you
say
if
you
only
go
halves
in
this
lark
he
finished
brightening
up
well
i
will
said
percy
to
make
atonement
come
up
to
our
room
then
and
think
it
out
cried
van
gleefully
flying
over
the
stairs
three
at
a
bound
sh
sh
and
hurry
up
just
then
the
gave
a
loud
peal
and
jencks
the
butler
opened
it
to
receive
a
box
about
two
feet
long
and
one
broad
for
miss
phronsie
pepper
said
the
footman
on
the
steps
holding
it
out
but
it
not
to
be
given
to
her
till
all
right
said
jencks
taking
it
that
the
sixth
box
for
miss
phronsie
that
i
took
in
this
morning
he
soliloquized
going
down
the
hall
and
reading
the
address
carefully
and
all
the
same
size
jencks
laid
the
parcel
quickly
on
one
of
the
oaken
chairs
in
the
hall
and
hurried
to
the
door
to
be
met
by
another
parcel
for
miss
phronsie
pepper
not
to
be
given
to
her
till
and
the
size
he
ejaculated
squinting
at
it
as
he
went
back
to
pick
up
the
first
parcel
as
like
as
two
peas
they
are
upstairs
polly
was
at
work
with
happy
fingers
alexia
across
the
room
asking
every
third
minute
polly
how
does
it
go
o
dear
i
ca
do
anything
unless
you
look
and
see
if
it
right
and
polly
would
turn
her
back
on
a
certain
cloud
of
white
muslin
and
floating
lace
and
flying
off
to
alexia
to
give
the
necessary
criticism
with
a
pull
here
and
a
pat
there
would
set
matters
straight
presently
running
back
to
her
own
work
again
you
see
she
said
everything
must
be
just
right
for
next
to
mamsie
wedding
this
is
to
be
the
most
important
occasion
alexia
rhys
that

said
alexia
twitching
a
pink
satin
bow
on
the
handle
of
a
o
dear
me
this
bow
looks
like
everything
i
tried
six
different
times
to
make
it
hang
down
quite
careless
and
refined
and
just
to
provoke
me
it
pokes
up
like
a
stiff
old
thing
in
my
face
do
come
and
tie
it
polly
so
polly
jumped
up
again
and
laying
determined
fingers
on
the
refractory
bow
sent
it
into
a
shape
that
alexia
protested
was
too
lovely
for
anything

going
to
have
a
party

with
it
in
all
this
world
and
polly
hid
her
face
behind
a
cloud
of
muslin
that
was
slowly
coming
into
shape
as
a
dress
for
one
of
phronsie
biggest
dolls
it
will
be
dreadful
said
alexia
with
a
pathetic
little
sniff
and
beginning
on
a
second
pink
bow
but
then
you
know
it
your
duty
to
go
off
nicely
and
i
sure
you
ca
do
it
polly
without
a
farewell
party
yes
said
polly
slowly
but
then
i
really
rather
write
little
notes
to
all
the
girls
but
i
suppose
they
all
enjoy
the
party
she
added
indeed
they
will
declared
alexia
quickly
o
dear
me
i
wish
i
was
going
with
you
you
have
a
perfectly
royal
time
i
going
to
work
hard
at
my
music
you
know
declared
polly
raising
her
head
suddenly
a
glow
on
her
round
cheek
oh
well
you
only
peg
away
at
it
when
you
a
mind
said
alexia
carelessly
and
setting
lazy
stitches
most
of
the
time
you
be
jaunting
around
seeing
things
and
having
fun
generally
oh
do
i
wish
i
was
going
with
you
alexia
rhys
cried
polly
in
astonishment
and
casting
her
needle
from
her
she
deserted
the
muslin
cloud
summarily
only
peg
away
when
i
have
the
mind
she
repeated
indignantly
well
i
shall
have
the
mind
most
of
the
time
i
can
tell
you
why
that
what
i
am
going
abroad
for
to
study
music
how
can
i
ever
teach
it
if
i
do
go
pray
tell
she
demanded
and
now
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
hands
worked
nervously
oh
nonsense
cried
alexia
not
looking
at
the
face
before
her
and
going
on
recklessly
as
if
that
meant
anything
all
that
talk
about
your
being
a
polly
and
she
gave
a
little
incredulous
laugh
polly
got
out
of
her
chair
somehow
and
stood
very
close
to
the
fussing
fingers
over
the
pink
satin
bow
do
you
never
dare
say
that
to
me
again
she
commanded
it
the
whole
of
my
life
to
be
a
the
very
whole
oh
polly
down
went
the
satin
bow
dragging
with
it
alexia
spool
of
silk
and
the
dainty
scissors
do
do
i
did
mean
anything
but
you
really
know
that
king
will
never
let
you
be
a
in
all
this
world
never
you
know
it
polly
oh
do
look
like
that
please
do
he
will
said
polly
in
a
low
but
perfectly
distinct
voice
for
he
has
promised
me
well
he
get
out
of
it
somehow
said
alexia
her
evil
genius
urging
her
on
for
you
know
polly
it
would
be
too
queer
for
any
of
his
family
and
and
a
girl
of
our
set
to
turn
out
a
you
know
polly
that
it
would
and
alexia
smiled
in
the
most
convincing
way
and
jumped
up
to
throw
her
arms
around
her
friend
if
any
of
the
girls
in
our
set
said
polly
grandly
and
stepping
off
from
alexia
wish
to
draw
away
from
me
they
can
do
so
now
i
am
to
be
a
i
perfectly
happy
to
be
one
i
want
you
all
to
understand
just
as
happy
as
i
can
possibly
be
in
all
this
world
why
it
what
i
been
studying
and
working
for
and
how
else
do
you
suppose
i
can
ever
repay
dear
grandpapa
for
helping
me
her
voice
broke
and
she
stopped
a
minute
clasping
her
hands
tightly
to
keep
back
the
rush
of
words
oh
polly
cried
alexia
in
dismay
and
beginning
to
whimper
she
tried
again
to
put
her
arm
around
her
do
touch
me
said
polly
waving
her
off
with
an
imperative
hand
oh
polly
polly
and
the
rest
of
our
set
may
feel
as
you
do
then
i
do
want
them
to
keep
on
liking
me
said
polly
with
her
most
superb
air
and
drawing
off
further
yet
polly
if
you
do
stop
you
you
kill
me
gasped
alexia
oh
polly
i
do
care
what
you
are
you
may
teach
all
day
if
you
want
to
and
i
help
get
you
scholars
i
do
anything
and
so
will
all
the
girls
i
know
they
will
polly
do
let
me
be
your
friend
just
as
i
was
o
dear
dear
i
wish
i
had
said
anything
i
wish
i
had
bitten
my
tongue
off
i
did
think
you
mind
it
so
much
and
now
alexia
broke
down
and
sobbed
outright
you
got
to
say
it
glorious
to
teach
said
polly
unmoved
and
with
her
highest
air
on
and
that
you
glad
i
going
to
do
it
it
glo
glorious
to
teach
mumbled
poor
alexia
behind
her
wet
handkerchief
and
i
glad
you
going
to
do
it
dictated
polly
inflexibly
i
glad
you
going
to
do
it
echoed
alexia
in
a
dismal
tone
then
i
be
your
friend
once
more
consented
polly
with
a
slow
step
toward
alexia
that
is
if
you
never
in
all
this
world
say
such
a
dreadful
thing
again
alexia
rhys
do
ask
me
you
know
i
wo
promised
alexia
her
spirits
rising
so
polly
went
over
to
her
and
set
a
kiss
on
her
wet
cheek
comforting
her
as
only
polly
could
and
before
long
the
pink
satin
bow
with
the
spool
of
silk
hanging
to
it
and
the
scissors
were
found
under
the
table
and
polly
attacked
the
muslin
cloud
with
redoubled
vigor
and
the
girls
voices
carried
merry
laughter
and
scraps
of
happy
talk
and
chatterton
stole
out
of
the
little
next
to
them
and
shut
herself
up
in
her
own
apartment
dear
me
how
fine
that
doll
gown
is
to
be
polly
exclaimed
alexia
after
a
bit
is
the
lace
going
on
all
around
the
bottom
yes
said
polly
biting
off
her
thread
and
giving
the
muslin
breadths
a
little
shake
felicie
is
tucking
the
flounce
then
i
shall
have
to
sew
on
the
lace
how
many
dolls
are
there
to
refurbish
before
asked
alexia
suddenly
four
no
five
said
polly
rapidly
counting
for
the
one
that
grandpapa
gave
her
christmas
before
last
celestine
you
know
does
need
a
new
waist
i
forgot
her
but
that
does
count
the
new
sashes
and
the
hair
ribbons
and
the
lace
ruffles
around
the
necks
i
guess
there
are
almost
fifty
of
them
dear
me
i
must
hurry
and
she
began
to
sew
faster
yet
what
a
nuisance
all
those
dolls
are
said
alexia
they
take
up
every
bit
of
your
spare
time
that
is
the
worst
of
it
said
polly
alexia
i
do
know
what
we
shall
do
for
phronsie
works
over
them
till
she
quite
tired
out
you
ought
to
see
her
this
morning
she
up
in
the
at
it
now
i
suppose
said
alexia
dressing
every
one
of
them
for
the
party
yes
said
polly
she
is
well
i
hope
no
one
will
give
her
a
doll
said
alexia
at
least
no
one
but
king
of
course
he
will
oh
no
one
else
will
declared
polly
cheerfully
of
course
not
alexia
and
then
jencks
walked
in
with
his
seven
boxes
exactly
alike
as
to
size
and
deposited
them
solemnly
in
a
row
on
the
blue
and
white
lounge
for
miss
phronsie
pepper
and
not
to
be
opened
till
miss
mary
polly
said
alexia
in
a
stage
whisper
and
jumping
up
as
jencks
disappeared
to
run
over
to
the
row
do
you
suppose
they
are
dolls
i
shall
die
if
they
are
declared
polly
desperately
and
sitting
quite
still
they
surely
look
like
dolls
on
the
very
covers
said
alexia
fingering
the
cords
would
it
be
so
very
wrong
to
open
one
box
and
just
relieve
our
suspense
just
one
polly
no
no
do
cried
polly
sharply
they
belong
to
phronsie
but
o
dear
me
and
just
think
said
alexia
like
a
job
comforter
and
looking
over
at
the
clock
it
only
eleven
polly
pepper
there
time
for
oceans
more
to
come
in
yet
it
perfectly
horrid
to
get
such
a
scrap
of
an
outing
said
joel
that
night
sprawling
on
the
rug
before
the
library
fire
only
four
days
why
could
marks
be
sick
longer
than
that
if
he
was
going
to
be
sick
at
all
pray
these
four
days
will
give
you
strength
for
your
wo
they
joe
asked
van
joel
turned
his
black
eyes
on
him
and
coolly
said
yes
then
made
a
wry
face
doubled
up
a
bit
of
paper
and
aimed
it
at
van
davie
sighed
and
looked
up
anxiously
i
hope
marks
will
come
out
all
right
so
that
we
can
go
back
monday
i
only
hope
he
stay
ill
said
joel
affectionately
is
safe
anyway
for
us
to
go
back
monday
it
may
be
typhoid
fever
you
know
mamsie
looking
over
at
her
they
let
us
know
soon
enough
if
that
the
case
said
mother
fisher
in
the
over
by
the
no
i
expect
your
letter
will
say
monday
well
it
a
downright
shame
for
us
to
be
pulled
off
so
soon
cried
joel
indignantly
sitting
straight
think
how
soon
the
term
ends
joe
cried
polly
then
you
have
such
a
long
outing
she
sighed
as
she
thought
of
the
separation
to
come
and
the
sea
between
them
that
nothing
only
a
dreadful
little
time
soon
will
be
gone
grunted
joel
turning
his
face
to
look
at
the
flames
the
cool
evening
had
made
necessary
ben
glanced
over
at
polly
do
talk
of
the
summer
he
was
going
to
say
but
stopped
in
time
phronsie
set
her
doll
carefully
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
and
went
over
to
joel
does
your
head
ache
often
at
school
joel
she
asked
softly
laying
her
cool
little
palm
on
his
stubby
hair
yes
said
joel
it
does
awfully
phronsie
and
nobody
cares
and
says
studying
a
shout
greeted
this
that
too
bad
said
phronsie
pityingly
i
shall
just
write
and
ask
marks
if
he
wo
let
you
stop
and
rest
when
it
aches
do
any
good
phronsie
said
joel
nothing
would
he
a
regular
old
grinder
marks
is
marks
said
phronsie
slowly
i
do
know
who
you
mean
by
marks
joel
and
what
is
a
grinder

down
on
her
knees
to
look
in
his
face
and
he
works
us
boys
so
phronsie
you
ca
think
said
joel
ignoring
the
question
what
is
a
grinder
joel
please
tell
me
repeated
phronsie
with
gentle
persistence
oh
a
grinder
is
a
horrid
buffer
began
joel
impatiently
joel
said
fisher
reprovingly
the
fire
in
her
black
eyes
was
not
pleasant
to
look
at
and
after
one
glance
he
turned
back
to
the
blazing
logs
once
more
i
ca
help
it
he
muttered
picking
up
the
tongs
to
poke
the
fire
do
ever
let
me
hear
that
excuse
from
a
son
of
mine
said
mother
fisher
scornfully
ca
help
it
i
be
master
of
myself
that
one
thing
joel
set
the
tongs
back
with
an
unsteady
hand
they
slipped
and
fell
to
the
hearth
with
a
clang
mamsie
i
did
mean
he
began
finding
his
feet
and
before
any
one
could
draw
a
long
breath
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
there
was
a
dreadful
pause
polly
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
and
looked
at
her
mother
fisher
quietly
put
her
sewing
into
the
big
basket
and
got
out
of
her
chair
oh
what
is
the
matter
with
joey
cried
phronsie
standing
quite
still
by
the
deserted
mamsie
do
you
suppose
his
head
aches
i
think
it
must
said
fisher
gravely
then
she
went
out
very
quietly
and
they
could
hear
her
going
up
the
stairs
with
a
firm
step
she
went
into
her
own
room
and
turned
up
the
gas
the
flash
revealed
joel
face
downward
on
the
broad
comfortable
sofa
fisher
went
over
and
closed
the
door
then
came
to
his
side
i
thought
my
boy
she
said
that
i
should
find
you
here
now
then
tell
mother
all
about
it
and
lifting
his
head
she
sat
down
and
took
it
into
her
lap
o
dear
cried
joel
burrowing
deep
in
the
comfortable
lap
o
dear
o
dear
now
that
is
silly
joey
said
mother
fisher
tell
me
at
once
what
all
this
trouble
is
about
passing
her
firm
hands
over
his
hot
forehead
and
trying
to
look
in
his
face
but
he
struggled
to
turn
it
away
from
her
in
the
first
place
i
just
hate
school
he
exploded
xxii
joel
hate
school
cried
mother
fisher
oh
joey
think
how
ben
wanted
more
schooling
only
he
would
take
the
chance
when
king
offered
it
to
him
because
he
felt
that
he
must
be
earning
money
as
soon
as
possible
oh
joey
that
oh
joey
cut
deeply
joel
winced
and
burrowed
deeper
under
his
mother
fingers
that
just
it
he
cried
ben
wanted
it
and
i
do
i
hate
it
and
i
do
want
to
go
back
do
want
to
go
back
repeated
fisher
in
dismay
no
i
do
the
fellows
are
always
twitting
me
and
every
one
gets
ahead
of
me
and
i
everlastingly
staying
in
from
ballgames
to
make
up
lessons
and
i
like
to
fire
the
books
i
would
cried
joel
with
venom
fisher
said
nothing
but
the
hands
still
stroked
the
brown
stubby
head
in
her
lap
and
nobody
cares
for
me
because
i
wo
be
smart
like
the
others
but
i
ca
help
it
i
just
hate
school
finished
joel
in
the
same
strain
joel
said
fisher
slowly
if
that
is
the
case
i
shall
go
down
to
king
and
tell
him
that
we
father
fisher
and
i
polly
and
phronsie
will
not
go
abroad
with
him
joel
bolted
upright
and
putting
down
his
two
hands
brought
his
black
eyes
to
bear
on
her
what
i
shall
go
directly
downstairs
and
tell
king
that
father
fisher
and
i
polly
and
phronsie
will
not
go
abroad
with
him
repeated
his
mother
slowly
and
distinctly
while
she
looked
him
fully
in
the
face
you
ca
do
that
said
joel
in
amazement
he
engaged
the
that
makes
no
difference
said
fisher
when
a
woman
has
a
boy
who
needs
her
nothing
should
stand
in
the
way
and
i
must
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
you
joel
joel
sprang
to
his
feet
and
began
to
prance
up
and
down
the
floor
big
enough
to
take
care
of
myself
mother
he
declared
coming
up
to
her
to
prance
off
again
so
i
thought
said
fisher
composedly
or
i
should
have
placed
you
at
marks
school
the
idea
mamsie
of
your
staying
at
home
to
take
care
of
me
said
joel
excitedly
why
feel
of
that
he
bared
his
arm
and
coming
up
thrust
it
out
for
inspection
is
that
splendid
i
do
verily
believe
i
could
whip
any
fellow
in
school
i
do
he
cried
regarding
his
muscles
affectionately
if
you
do
believe
it
just
pinch
them
hard
you
do
mean
it
really
mamsie
what
you
said
of
course
the
idea
of
staying
at
home
to
take
care
of
me
and
he
began
to
prance
again
i
do
care
how
many
boys
you
can
whip
observed
mother
fisher
coolly
as
long
as
you
ca
whip
your
own
self
when
you
naughty
you
too
weak
to
go
alone
and
i
must
stay
at
home
joel
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
at
her
and
before
i
give
up
a
boy
of
thirteen
and
beg
to
be
taken
away
from
school
because
the
lessons
were
hard
and
i
did
like
to
study
i
work
myself
to
skin
and
bone
but
i
go
through
creditably
fisher
sat
straight
now
as
an
arrow
in
her
corner
of
the
sofa
said
my
say
joel
she
finished
after
a
pause
and
now
i
shall
go
down
and
tell
mr
king
mother
howled
joel
dashing
across
the
room
to
her
do
go
stay
i
will
do
say
that
again
about
my
having
to
be
taken
care
of
like
a
baby
i
be
good
mother
and
study
study
does
amount
to
much
unless
you
are
glad
of
the
chance
said
fisher
sharply
i
would
give
a
fig
for
it
being
driven
to
it
and
her
lips
curled
scornfully
joel
wilted
miserably

mother
fisher
slowly
releasing

jasper
as
the
sound
of
the
two
voices

be
heard
in
mother
fisher
room
do
you
want
to
come
into
my
den
i
some
new
bugs
in
the
cabinet
found
a
regular
beauty
phronsie
stood
quite
still
just
where
joel
had
left
her
her
hands
were
clasped
and
tears
were
rolling
slowly
down
her
cheeks
no
she
said
without
looking
at
him
jasper
i

he
begged
going
over
to
her
and
holding
out
his
hand

new
one

with
yellow
stripes
and
two
long
horns

the
child
quietly

phronsie

dear
she
took
hold
of
the
clasped
hands
and
smiled
up
into
the
drooping
face
but
phronsie
shook
her
head
and
said
no
if
grandpapa
should
come
in
and
find
her
so
be
very
dreadful
exclaimed
polly
looking
over
at
the
five
boys
who
in
this
sudden
emergency
were
knocked
speechless

all
play
some
game

one

jasper
brightly

jasper
nodding
furiously
at
him

van
going
over
to
her
where
she
sat
on
the
rug
at
phronsie
feet
polly

asked
wheedlingly

little
rings
of
brown
hair
from
her
forehead

van

van
exclaimed
jasper
indignantly
polly
i
would
indulge
him
i
know
phronsie
wants
a
story
do
you
phronsie
asked
van
artfully
and
running
over
to
peer
into
her
face
but
to
his
astonishment
phronsie
stood
perfectly
still
no
she
said
again
i
do
want
a
story
joey

be
sick
jasper
cried
polly
in
despair
and
springing
up
something
must
be
done
grandpapa
coming
i
hear
him
phronsie
said
jasper
bending
to
speak
into
her
ear
do

making
polly
feel
very
unhappy
just
think
the
next
thing
i
do

but

she
cry
phronsie
unfolded
her
hands
give
me
your
handkerchief
polly
she
said
winking
back
the
rest
of
the
tears
now
there
a
dear
cried
polly
pulling
out
her
handkerchief
and
wiping
the
wet
little
face
none
too
soon
the
door
opened
and
king
came
in
well
well
well
he
exclaimed
looking
over
his
spectacles
at
them
all
playing
games
hey

going
to
said
ben
and
jasper
together
no
polly

a
story
said
van
loudly
that
is
if
you
want
to
hear
it
grandpapa
do
say
you
do
he
begged
going
over
to
whisper
in
his
ear
i
want
immensely
to
hear
it
declared
the
old
gentleman
pulling
up
an
to
the
fireside
there
now
sitting
down
i
fixed
now
proceed
my
dear
van
softly
clapped
his
hands
phronsie
king
beckoned
to
her
and
then
suggestively
touched
his
knee
here
dear
phronsie
scurried
across
the
room
to
his
side
yes
grandpapa
there
up
she
goes
sang
king
swinging
her
into
position
on
his
lap
now
then
polly
my
child
we
are
all
ready
for
the
wonderful
tale
stay
where
is
joel
joel
went
upstairs
a
little
while
ago
said
jasper
quickly
well
now
polly
do
begin
i
tell
how
we
went
to
buy
phronsie
shoes
said
polly
drawing
up
an
ottoman
to
king
side
now
boys
bring
your
chairs
up
joel
ought
to
know
that
you
are
going
to
tell
a
story
polly
said
king
one
of
you
boys
run
out
and
call
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
in
mamsie
room
said
ben
i
suppose
when
she
gets
through
with
him
he
come
down
oh
ah
said
the
old
gentleman
well
polly
then
perhaps
you
would
better
proceed
so
polly
began
on
the
never
tiresome
recital
how
phronsie
fell
down
the
stairs
leading
from
the
kitchen
to
the
provision
room
in
the
little
brown
house
with
the
in
her
hand
and
how
because
she
cut
her
thumb
so
that
it
bled
dreadfully
mother
decided
that
she
could
at
last
have
a
pair
of
shoes
bought
especially
for
her
very
own
self
and
how
deacon
brown
old
horse
and
wagon
were
procured
and
they
all
set
forth
except
mother
and
how
they
rode
to
town
and
how
the
beebes
were
just
as
good
as
gold
and
how
the
shoes
fitted
as
if
they
were
made
for
phronsie
feet
and
how
they
all
went
home
and
how
phronsie
danced
around
the
kitchen
till
she
was
all
tired
out
and
then
went
to
bed
carrying
the
new
shoes
with
her
and
how
she
fell
asleep
with
why
i
declare
exclaimed
polly
reaching
this
denouement
in
a
delightfully
roundabout
way
if
she
is
asleep
now
and
indeed
she
was
so
she
had
to
be
carried
up
to
bed
in
the
same
old
way
only
this
time
it
was
jasper
instead
of
polly
who
held
her
do
you
believe
we
better
put
it
off
till
some
other
night
whispered
percy
to
van
on
the
way
upstairs
to
bed
the
library
party
having
broken
up
early
a
fellow
does
want
to
see
a
burglar
on
top
of
the
time
joel
has
had
no
no
said
van
it
be
good
for
him
and
knock
the
other
thing
out
of
his
head
do
you
see
percy
i
should
want
something
else
to
think
of
if
i
were
joel
you
ca
back
out
you
promised
you
know
well
and
i
do
it
said
percy
testily
it
no
use
trying
to
sleep
declared
joel
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
kicking
the
for
the
dozenth
time
into
a
roll
at
the
foot
as
long
as
i
can
see
mamsie
eyes
i
just
get
up
and
tackle
that
latin
grammar
now
whew
have
i
got
to
work
though
might
as
well
begin
at
it
and
he
jumped
out
of
bed
stepping
softly
over
to
the
door
that
led
into
david
little
room
he
closed
it
carefully
and
with
a
sigh
lighted
the
gas
then
he
went
over
to
the
table
where
his
schoolbooks
ought
to
have
been
but
instead
the
space
was
piled
with
a
great
variety
of
things
one
or
two
balls
a
tennis
racket
and
a
confusion
of
fishing
tackle
while
in
front
the
last
thing
that
had
occupied
him
that
day
lay
a
book
of
artificial
flies
joel
set
his
teeth
together
hard
and
looked
at
them
suppose
i
get
much
of
this
sort
of
thing
this
summer
he
muttered
here
goes
and
without
trusting
himself
to
take
another
look
he
swept
them
all
off
down
to
the
floor
and
into
a
corner
there
he
said
standing
up
straight
lie
there
will
you
but
they
loomed
up
in
a
suggestive
heap
and
his
fingers
trembled
to
just
touch
them
once
i
must
cover
up
the
things
or
else
i
know
i
be
at
them
he
said
and
hurrying
over
to
the
bed
he
dragged
off
the
now
and
he
threw
it
over
the
fascinating
mass
i
got
to
study
dear
me
where
are
my
books
for
the
next
five
minutes
joel
had
enough
to
do
to
collect
his
working
instruments
and
when
at
last
he
unearthed
them
from
the
corner
of
his
closet
where
he
had
thrown
them
under
a
pile
of
boots
he
was
tired
enough
to
sit
down
i
do
know
which
to
go
at
first
he
groaned
whirling
the
leaves
of
the
upper
book
it
ought
to
be
latin
but
then
it
ought
to
be
algebra
just
as
much
and
as
for
history
well
there
here
goes
i
take
them
as
they
come
with
a
very
red
face
joel
plunged
into
the
first
one
under
his
hand
it
proved
to
be
the
latin
grammar
and
with
a
grimace
he
found
the
page
and
resting
his
elbows
on
the
table
he
seized
each
side
of
his
stubby
head
with
his
hands
i
hang
on
to
my
hair
he
said
and
plunged
into
his
task
and
now
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
but
his
hard
breathing
and
the
noise
he
made
turning
the
leaves
for
he
very
soon
found
he
was
obliged
to
go
back
many
lessons
to
understand
how
to
approach
the
one
before
him
and
with
cheeks
growing
every
instant
more
scarlet
with
shame
and
confusion
the
drops
of
perspiration
ran
down
his
forehead
and
fell
on
his
book
whew
he
exclaimed
it
horribly
hot
and
pushing
back
his
book
he
tiptoed
over
to
the
other
window
and
softly
raised
it
the
cool
air
blew
into
his
face
and
leaning
far
out
into
the
dark
night
he
drew
in
deep
breaths
i
skinned
through
and
saved
my
neck
a
thousand
times
he
reflected
and
now
i
got
to
dig
like
sixty
to
make
up
there
dave
now
sleeping
in
there
like
a
cat
he
does
have
anything
to
do
but
to
run
ahead
of
the
class
like
lightning
just
because
he
loves
it
something
seemed
to
sting
the
words
into
him
joel
drew
in
his
head
and
turned
abruptly
away
from
the
window
pshaw
well
here
goes
he
exclaimed
again
throwing
himself
into
his
chair
she
said
work
myself
to
skin
and
bone
but
i
get
through
creditably
joel
bared
his
brown
arm
and
regarded
it
critically
i
wonder
how
look
all
skin
and
bone
and
he
gave
a
short
laugh
but
this
is
studying
he
pulled
down
his
sleeve
and
his
head
went
over
the
book
again
outside
a
bright
blue
eye
applied
to
the
keyhole
gave
place
to
a
bright
brown
one
till
such
time
as
the
persons
to
whom
the
eyes
belonged
were
satisfied
as
to
the
condition
of
the
interior
they
were
surveying
what
do
you
suppose
he
doing
whispered
the
taller
figure
putting
his
face
concealed
under
a
black
mask
closely
to
the
ear
of
the
other
person
whose
countenance
was
similarly
adorned
do
know
whispered
the
second
black
mask
he
acts
dreadfully
queer
but
i
suppose
he
got
a
novel
so
you
see
it
our
duty
to
break
it
up
he
added
virtuously
the
taller
figure
shook
his
head
but
as
it
was
very
dark
on
their
side
of
joel
door
the
movement
was
unobserved
well
come
on
whispered
the
second
black
mask
are
you
ready
yes
come
then
o
dear
dear
grunted
joel
i
rather
chop
wood
as
i
used
to
years
ago
to
help
the
little
brown
house
out
swinging
his
arms
up
over
his
head
why
and
he
was
left
in
darkness
his
arms
falling
nervously
to
his
side
while
a
cautious
step
across
the
room
made
his
black
eyes
stand
out
in
fright
a
burglar
a
burglar
flashed
through
his
mind
he
held
his
breath
hard
and
his
knees
knocked
together
but
mamsie
eyes
seemed
to
look
with
scorn
on
him
again
joel
straightened
up
clenched
his
fist
and
every
minute
expecting
to
be
knocked
on
the
head
he
crept
like
a
cat
to
the
further
corner
even
in
this
extremity
grumbling
inwardly
because
king
would
not
allow
firearms
if
i
only
had
them
now
he
thought
well
i
must
get
my
club
but
there
was
no
time
to
get
it
joel
creeping
along
feeling
his
way
cautiously
soon
knew
that
there
were
two
burglars
instead
of
one
in
the
room
and
his
mind
was
made
up
they
be
after
grandpapa
money
sure
he
thought
i
have
got
to
get
out
and
warn
him
but
how
that
was
the
question
getting
down
on
holding
his
breath
yet
with
never
a
thought
of
danger
to
himself
he
crept
along
toward
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
then
stopped
and
rested
under
cover
of
the
heavy
window
drapery
but
as
quick
as
a
flash
two
dark
figures
that
now
his
eyes
becoming
more
accustomed
to
the
darkness
he
could
dimly
distinguish
reached
there
before
him
and
the
key
clicking
in
the
lock
joel
knew
that
all
hope
from
escape
by
that
quarter
was
gone
like
a
cat
he
sprang
to
his
feet
swung
the
drapery
out
suddenly
toward
the
figures
and
in
the
next
second
hurled
himself
over
the
hanging
to
the
edge
grasping
the
blind
crawling
to
the
next
window
and
so
on
and
over
and
down
down
by
any
friendly
thing
he
could
grasp
to
the
ground
two
black
masks
hung
over
the
deserted
joe
joe
it
only
we
boys
percy
and
van
joe
joe
he
be
killed
gasped
van
his
face
as
white
as
joel
robe
fluttering
below
them
in
his
wild
descent
stop
him
percy
oh
do
stop
him
percy
clung
to
the
and
danced
in
distress
stop
him
he
was
beyond
uttering
anything
more
yes
oh
joe
do
you
see
it
only
percy
and
van
cried
van
persuasively
and
hanging
out
of
the
window
to
the
imminent
danger
of
adding
himself
to
joel
company
percy
shoved
him
back
he
down
he
said
finding
his
breath
now
we
run
downstairs
and
let
him
in
van
flew
off
from
the
window
i
go
it
my
scrape
and
he
was
unlocking
the
door
i
the
oldest
said
percy
hurrying
to
get
there
first
i
ought
to
have
known
better
this
made
van
furious
and
pushing
percy
with
all
his
might
he
wriggled
out
first
as
the
door
flew
open
and
not
forgetting
to
tiptoe
down
the
hall
he
hurried
along
percy
behind
him
to
hear
the
noise
of
men
feet
coming
over
the
stairs
van
tried
to
rush
forward
shouting
thomas
it
we
boys
percy
and
van
instead
he
only
succeeded
in
the
darkness
in
stumbling
over
a
chair
and
falling
flat
with
it
amid
a
frightful
racket
that
drowned
his
voice
old
king
who
had
been
awakened
by
the
previous
noise
and
had
rung
his
burglar
alarm
that
connected
with
thomas
and
jencks
rooms
in
the
stable
now
cried
out
from
his
doorway
make
quick
work
thomas
and
percy
saw
the
gleam
of
a
pistol
held
high
in
thomas
hand
up
with
a
rush
came
bare
feet
over
the
back
stairs
a
flutter
of
something
white
and
joel
sprang
in
between
them
it
percy
percy
he
screamed
do
you
see
thomas
i
percy
do
shoot
the
taller
burglar
kept
saying
without
intermission
while
the
flaring
of
candles
and
frightened
voices
told
of
the
aroused
household
make
quick
work
jencks
shouted
king
from
his
doorway
to
add
to
the
general
din
thomas
whose
blood
was
up
determined
once
for
all
to
put
an
end
to
the
profession
of
burglary
as
far
as
his
master
house
was
concerned
now
drew
nearer
steadying
his
pistol
and
trying
to
sight
the
nearest
fellow
this
proved
to
be
van
now
struggling
to
his
feet
joel
took
one
wild
step
forward
thomas
do
shoot
it
van
make
quick
work
thomas
called
king
there
was
but
a
moment
in
which
to
decide
it
was
either

whitney
in
distress
as
long
as
he
is
in
joel
room
for
i
can
see
your
mother
eyes
polly
it
would
kill
me
to
have
her
look
at
me
the
door
opened
at
this
and
the
trail
of
a
long
silken
wrapper
was
heard
on
the
floor
chatterton
said
whitney
raising
her
head
and
looking
at
the
with
as
much
anger
as
her
gentle
face
could
contain
i

not
see

my
room
excuse
me
but
i
am
unstrung
by
all
that

occurred

thought

might
sit
with

said
chatterton
in
the
brief
interval
since
the
arousing
of
the
household
she
had
contrived
to
make
a
perfect
breakfast
toilet
and
she
folded
her
hands
over
her
handsome
gown
polly
might
then
be
with
her
mother
but
if
you
do
wish
me
to
remain
i
will
go
i
do
not
need
you
said
whitney
decidedly
and
she
turned
to
polly
again
chatterton
moved
away
and
closed
the
door
after
her
auntie
said
polly
she
really
wants
to
help
you
polly
you
need
say
anything
about
it
exclaimed
whitney
like
many
other
gentle
creatures
when
roused
becoming
unreasonably
prejudiced
i
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
that
woman
she
has
been
here
so
long
and
is
so
intensely
disagreeable
to
us
all
polly
eyes
became
very
round
and
she
held
her
breath
in
astonishment
do
look
so
child
said
whitney
at
length
you

my
dear
but
you
would
if

were
in
my
place
she
sorry
for
it
said
polly
finding
her
tongue
at
last
and
father

nearly
worn
out
with
her
continued
whitney
and
now
to
come
parading
her
attentions
upon
me
it
who
who
dicky
now
that
the
excitement
in
joel
room
had
died
down
had
lost
his
relish
for
it
and
he
now
pranced
into
whitney
room
who
mamma
chatterton
said
whitney
unguardedly
she
has
disagreeably
intruded
herself
upon
me
has
she
been
in
here
asked
dick
in
astonishment
yes
asking
if
she
can
sit
with
me
and
polly
started
at
the
look
in
the
usually
soft
blue
eyes
and
you
would
let
her
asked
dick
stopping
short
and
regarding
his
mother
curiously
of
course
not
dicky
she
made
haste
to
say
then
i
think

very
wrong
declared
dick
flatly
oh
dick
exclaimed
polly
in
consternation
and
you
do
act
like
my
mother
at
all
said
dick
standing
quite
stiffly
on
his
sturdy
legs
and
gazing
at
her
with
disapprobation
did
chatterton
save
my
life
he
exploded
when
the
real
burglar
was
going
for
me
say
did
she
he
cried
i
have
yet
to
find
out
that

the
truth
said
whitney
finding
her
voice
oh
dicky
she
added
hurt
that
he
should
defend
another
worst
of
all
chatterton
do
talk
about
her
but
i
ought
to
talk
about
her
persisted
dick
she
saved
me
as
much
as
she
could
because
she
wo
let
anybody
thank
her
i
like
her
more
myself
i
going
to
stay
with
her
with
that
he
held
his
head
high
and
marched
to
the
door
dick
dick
called
his
mother
come
back
dear
dick
slowly
turned
and
made
his
way
to
her
side
but
he
still
regarded
her
with
disapproval
dick
i
want
you
to
go
to
chatterton
room
and
say
that
i
am
sorry

refused
her

would
like
to
have
her
sit
with
me

i
am
sorry

refused
her
offer
to
help
dicky
she
leaned
forward
and
kissed
her
boy
her
long
soft
hair
falling
like
a
veil
around
the
two
faces
dick
threw
his
arms
around
her
neck
now
you
a
brick
he
declared
impulsively
i
bring
the
old
lady
and
we
both
sit
with
you
so
polly
was
free
to
run
back
to
mamsie
on
the
way
there
she
opened
the
door
of
phronsie
little
room
just
out
of
father
and
mother
fisher
how
good
it
is
that
she
sleeps
through
it
all
said
polly
listening
to
the
regular
breathing
then
she
stole
across
the
room
and
stood
beside
the
small
bed
she
looks
just
as
she
did
the
night
she
took
her
new
shoes
to
bed
thought
polly
one
hand
is
over
her
head
exactly
as
it
was
then
oh
phronsie
to
think
that
you
to
have
no
party
and
she
turned
off
with
a
sigh
went
out
and
closed
the
door
percy
here
all
right
cried
jasper
running
over
the
stairs
to
meet
her
at
the
top
his
eyes
were
gleaming
with
excitement
and
his
face
was
torn
and
bleeding
are
you
hurt
cried
polly
feeling
as
if
the
whole
family
were
bound
to
destruction
oh
jasper
did
you
fall
nothing
but
a
scratch
i
was
fool
enough
to
forget
the
ledge
and
walked
off
for
my
pains
oh
jasper
cried
polly
with
paling
cheeks
let
me
bathe
it
for
you
do
her
strength
began
to
return
at
the
thought
of
action
and
she
sprang
for
a
basin
of
water
nonsense
no
polly
cried
jasper
with
a
quick
hand
detaining
her
it
nothing
but
a
mere
scratch
i
tell
you
but
i
suppose
it
looks
terribly
i
go
and
wash
it
off
run
and
tell
his
mother
that
percy
is
found
is
he
all
right
asked
polly
fearfully
holding
her
breath
for
the
answer
sound
as
a
nut
declared
jasper
we
found
him
streaking
it
down
the
locust
path
he
said
he
was
going
to
run
off
to
sea
run
off
to
sea
repeated
polly
oh
jasper
well
he
was
so
frightened
of
course
he
did
know
what
to
say
replied
jasper
and
ashamed
too
he
did
care
to
show
his
head
at
home
i
do
know
as
i
blame
him
polly
well
it
too
bad
about
phronsie
party
is
it
added
jasper
mopping
up
his
face
as
the
two
went
down
the
hall
yes
said
polly
with
a
sigh
stopping
at
whitney
door
but
oh
think
how
happy
we
are
now
that
percy
is
safe
jasper
still
it
too
bad
for
phronsie
repeated
jasper
looking
back
but
joel
flatly
declared
that
the
first
one
that
even
so
much
as
hinted
that
a
single
item
of
the
arrangements
for
phronsie
party
should
be
changed
he
make
it
disagreeable
as
only
he
knew
how
for
that
one
when
he
got
up
from
his
bed
yes
sir
and
he
scolded
and
fretted
and
fussed
and
laid
down
the
law
so
generally
to
all
not
excepting
the
doctor
that
at
last
it
was
decided
to
let
the
party
go
on
then
he
lay
back
against
the
pillows
quite
exhausted
but
with
a
beatific
face
i
should
think
you
would
be
tired
joe
exclaimed
jasper
bullied
us
so
dear
me
people
ought
to
be
angelic
when
they
sick
at
least
if
you
had
him
to
take
care
of
as
i
did
observed
fisher
you
know
better
goodness
me
the
little
brown
house
scarcely
held
him
when
he
was
getting
over
the
measles
what
the
use
of
being
sick
said
joel
reflectively
turning
on
his
pillow
if
you
ca
make
people
stand
around
i
like
to
know
now
that
point
settled
about
phronsie
party
wo
you
all
go
out
like
to
speak
to
father
fisher
a
moment
you
do
mean
me
joey
said
mother
fisher
at
the
head
of
the
bed
holding
her
boy
hand
yes
you
too
mamsie
said
joel
giving
her
an
affectionate
glance
it
something
that
only
the
doctor
and
i
are
to
know
you
not
hurt
anywhere
else
are
you
joey
asked
his
mother
a
sudden
alarm
leaping
to
her
black
eyes
not
a
scratch
said
joel
promptly
i
want
to
see
father
fisher
about
something
sometime
you
shall
know
mamsie
he
gave
her
hand
a
sudden
pressure
then
let
it
go
perhaps
you
would
better
step
out
my
dear
said
the
little
doctor
nodding
to
his
wife
so
fisher
smothering
a
sigh
went
out
reluctantly
all
out
asked
joel
trying
to
raise
his
head
to
see
for
himself
every
soul
said
fisher
well
see
here
will
you
said
joel
pointing
to
the
table
the
schoolbooks
scattered
as
he
had
left
them
pack
those
things
all
away
in
the
closet
on
the
shelf
you
know
and
put
the
rubbish
on
the
floor
there
back
on
the
table
fisher
could
not
for
his
life
refrain
from
asking
curiously
as
he
did
as
requested
been
having
a
pull
at
the
books
eh
joe
um
um
maybe
said
joel
twisting
uneasily
well
now
come
here
please
father
fisher
the
little
man
turned
away
from
the
table
with
its
sprawling
array
of
delightful
things
to
stand
by
the
bedside
you
must
get
me
well
as
soon
as
you
can
said
joel
confidentially
all
right
i
understand
fisher
nodded
professionally
and
whatever
you
say
do
let
it
be
that
i
must
be
careful
of
my
eyes
said
joel
all
right
that
is
if
you
get
up
quickly
agreed
the
doctor
that
all
said
joel
in
great
satisfaction
now
call
mamsie
in
and
the
others
and
in
the
morning
no
one
told
phronsie
what
had
happened
the
night
before
she
only
knew
that
joel
was
not
very
well
and
was
going
to
keep
his
room
all
her
pleadings
to
do
something
for
him
being
set
one
side
by
grandpapa
demands
upon
her
instant
attention
whenever
the
idea
suggested
itself
to
her
and
so
the
time
wore
along
till
the
party
began
alexia
was
the
first
to
arrive
her
bowl
of
orange
jelly
in
her
hand
and
after
her
a
tall
slight
figure
jumped
from
the
carriage
her
flaxen
hair
streaming
out
in
two
pale
braids
i
thought
i
pick
cathie
up
said
alexia
carelessly
had
to
pass
her
door
you
know
o
dear
me
what
perfectly
dreadful
times
you
had
last
night
polly
pepper
i
did
bring
macaroons
said
cathie
as
i
really
think
that
they
would
be
good
for
phronsie
besides
i
forgotten
how
to
make
them
and
our
cook
was
cross
and
said
i
should
come
into
her
kitchen
but
i
bought
a
doll
for
phronsie
my
mother
said
it
would
be
a
great
deal
more
sensible
present
and
she
hugged
the
long
box
under
her
arm
with
great
satisfaction
o
dear
dear
groaned
alexia
falling
back
with
polly
as
the
three
raced
along
the
hall
she
showed
it
to
me
in
the
carriage
and
it
a
perfect
guy
besides
counting
one
more
but
afflictions
like
this
were
small
to
polly
now
and
although
for
the
next
hour
it
rained
dolls
into
phronsie
puzzled
hands
polly
helped
her
to
thank
the
givers
and
to
dispose
them
safely
on
neighboring
chairs
and
tables
and
sofas
chatterton
was
the
pattern
of
old
king
phonograph
doll
at
which
discovery
he
turned
upon
her
with
venom
in
his
eye
my
gift
to
my
little
granddaughter
taking
especial
care
to
emphasize
the
relationship
has
always
been
a
doll
i
suppose
you
knew
that
cousin
eunice
and
to
try
to
procure
one
exactly
like
the
one
i
have
purchased
is
very
presuming
in
you
to
say
the
least
and
why
may
i
not
present
a
doll
to
phronsie
pepper
if
i
care
to
pray
tell
demanded
chatterton
in
a
high
cold
tone
why
because
you
have
always
showed
a
marked
dislike
for
the
child
cried
old
king
angrily
that
why
cousin
eunice
grandpapa
grandpapa
said
phronsie
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
to
parade
any
special
affection
such
as
the
presentation
of
a
gift
indicates
is
a
piece
of
presumption
on
your
part
i
say
it
again
cousin
eunice
grandpapa
said
phronsie
again
at
his
elbow
now
phronsie
turning
to
her
you
are
to
take
that
doll
pointing
to
a
gorgeous
affair
reposing
on
the
sofa
with
algernon
chatterton
card
attached
to
it
and
go
over
to
chatterton
and
say
very
distinctly
can
not
accept
this
gift
mind
you
say
it
distinctly
phronsie
that
there
may
be
no
mistake
in
the
future
oh
grandpapa
cried
phronsie
in
dismay
yes
child
i
know
what
is
best
for
you
take
that
doll
and
do
exactly
as
i
bid
you
a
dreadful
pause
fell
upon
the
room
polly
clasped
her
hands
while
alexia
and
the
other
girls
huddled
into
a
corner
saying
softly
oh
how
perfectly
dreadful
no
use
to
say
anything
to
father
when
he
looks
like
that
groaned
jasper
when
polly
besought
him
to
try
his
influence
his
blood
is
up
now
he
borne
a
good
deal
you
know
polly
o
dear
dear
whispered
polly
back
again
just
look
at
chatterton
face
and
at
poor
phronsie
ca
you
do
something
jasper
i
afraid
not
said
jasper
gloomily
no
he
making
her
give
it
back
see
polly
you
know
it
for
the
best
king
was
repeating
as
he
led
the
child
to
chatterton
standing
cold
and
silent
at
the
end
of
the
room
sometime
child
and
then
you
thank
me
that
i
saved
you
from
further
annoyance
of
this
sort
there
cousin
eunice
is
your
gift
taking
the
doll
from
phronsie
hand
and
placing
it
in
the
long
jeweled
one
my
little
granddaughter
receives
presents
only
from
those
who
love
her
all
others
are
unwarranted
and
must
be
returned
phronsie
burst
out
tearfully
she
sorry
grandpapa
i
know
she
is
and
she
loves
me
now
please
let
me
keep
the
doll
but
chatterton
had
left
the
room
the
doll
in
her
hand
xxiv
away
and
after
that
everybody
had
to
be
as
gay
as
possible
to
keep
phronsie
sad
little
face
from
being
flooded
with
tears
dear
me
exclaimed
jasper
here
comes
candace
now
what
do
you
suppose
she
has
for
you
phronsie
candace
sailed
through
the
doorway
with
ample
satisfaction
with
everything
and
herself
in
particular
whar
little
miss
she
demanded
her
turban
nodding
in
all
directions
and
her
black
eyes
rolling
from
side
to
side
there
candace
said
some
one
over
in
the
corner
with
jasper
oh
i
see
her
said
candace
waddling
over
to
them
well
now
phronsie
seein
you
could
come
to
me
for
somethin
i
made
fer
you
candace
has
to
come
to
you
see
dat
now
chile
she
unrolled
the
parcel
disclosing
the
wonderful
doll
adorned
with
candace
own
hair
and
ole
missus
ruffles
then
stood
erect
her
bosom
swelling
with
pride
and
delight
o
my
goodness
me
exclaimed
alexia
tumbling
back
after
the
first
and
only
glance
and
nearly
overturning
cathie
who
was
looking
over
her
shoulder
polly
pepper
o
dear
me
then
she
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
laughed
till
she
cried
hush
hush
cried
polly
running
over
to
her
do
stop
alexia
and
get
up
she
hear
you
and
we
would
hurt
her
feelings
for
the
world
do
stop
alexia
o
dear
me
cried
alexia
gustily
and
holding
her
sides
while
she
waved
back
and
forth
if
it
had
been
a
respectable
doll
but
that
horror
o
dear
me
stop
stop
commanded
polly
shaking
her
arm
but
alexia
was
beyond
stopping
herself
and
in
between
delighted
recital
how
she
combed
de
to
take
de
curl
out
and
how
ole
missus
ruffles
was
made
into
de
clothes
came
the
peals
of
laughter
that
finally
made
every
one
in
the
room
stop
and
look
at
the
girls
candace
come
into
my
and
get
a
pattern
for
some
new
pins
i
want
you
to
make
for
me
cried
jasper
desperately
dragging
her
off
it
no
use
to
lecture
me
said
alexia
sitting
straight
as
feet
shuffled
down
the
hall
and
wiping
her
face
exhaustedly
i
know
it
was
dreadful
o
dear
me
do
anybody
speak
to
me
or
i
shall
disgrace
myself
again
now
phronsie
what
do
you
suppose
we
are
to
do
next
phronsie
looked
up
into
old
king
face
i
do
know
grandpapa
she
said
wonderingly
well
now
my
dear
you
had
punch
and
judy
and
these
nice
children
waving
his
hand
to
indicate
the
delegation
from
the
orphan
asylum
have
sung
beautifully
for
you
now
what
comes
next
phronsie
i
do
know
grandpapa
repeated
phronsie
when
gifts
become
burdensome
they
no
longer
are
kindnesses
said
king
now
phronsie
i
have
found
out
never
mind
how
little
birds
you
now
sometimes
fly
around
telling
people
things
they
ought
to
know
well
i
have
discovered
in
some
way
that
my
little
girl
has
too
many
children
to
care
for
here
phronsie
brown
eyes
became
very
wide
and
when
there
are
too
many
children
in
the
nest
phronsie
why
they
have
to
go
out
into
the
world
to
try
their
fortunes
and
make
other
homes
now
there
are
so
many
poor
little
girls
who
have
any
children
phronsie
think
of
that
dear
and
you
have
so
many
phronsie
at
this
drew
nearer
and
stole
her
hand
into
his
now
what
is
to
be
done
about
it
asked
the
old
gentleman
putting
his
other
broad
palm
over
her
little
one
and
holding
it
fast
hey
my
pet
ca
we
buy
them
some
children
asked
phronsie
with
warm
interest
oh
grandpapa
dear
do
let
us
i
have
money
in
my
bank
phronsie
said
the
old
gentleman
going
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
at
once
and
lifting
her
to
his
lap
i
really
think
the
time
has
come
to
give
away
some
of
your
dolls
i
really
do
child
phronsie
gave
a
start
of
incredulity
and
peered
around
at
him
i
really
do
you
are
going
abroad
to
be
gone
well
we
say
a
year
and
your
dolls
would
be
so
lonely
without
anything
to
do
but
to
sit
all
day
and
think
of
their
little
mother
and
there
are
so
many
children
who
would
love
them
and
make
them
happy
now
king
white
hair
was
very
near
the
yellow
waves
floating
over
his
shoulder
so
that
none
but
phronsie
ears
caught
the
next
words
it
right
phronsie
dear
do
it
if
i
were
you
he
said
in
a
low
voice
do
you
want
it
grandpapa
asked
phronsie
softly
i
do
child
but
not
unless
you
are
willing
then
i
do
declared
phronsie
sitting
quite
straight
on
his
knee
and
she
gave
a
relieved
sigh
oh
grandpapa
if
we
only
had
the
poor
children
now
she
exclaimed
dreadfully
excited
come
then
old
king
set
her
on
her
feet
clear
the
way
there
good
people
we
are
going
to
find
some
poor
children
who
are
waiting
for
dolls
and
he
threw
wide
the
door
into
a
back
passage
and
there
presided
over
by
jencks
and
crowding
for
the
first
entrance
was
a
score
of
children
with
outstretched
hands
oh
oh
exclaimed
phronsie
with
cheeks
aflame
please
he
said
we
was
to
have
dolls
cried
one
girl
holding
out
both
her
hands
i
never
had
one
please
give
me
one
quick
never
had
one
echoed
phronsie
taking
a
step
toward
her
only
a
piece
miss
i
found
in
a
please
give
me
one
quick
she
never
had
a
doll
only
a
piece
repeated
phronsie
turning
back
to
the
family
unable
to
contain
this
information
ask
the
others
if
they
have
had
any
said
king
leaning
against
a
tall
cabinet
try
that
girl
there
in
a
brown
plaid
dress
have
you
ever
had
a
doll
asked
phronsie
obediently
looking
over
at
the
girl
indicated
and
holding
her
breath
for
the
answer
at
this
the
girl
in
the
brown
plaid
dress
burst
into
tears
which
so
distressed
phronsie
that
she
nearly
cried
yes
but
it
died
said
the
girl
after
a
little
oh
grandpapa
her
doll
died
exclaimed
phronsie
in
horror
no
it
did
jane
corrected
another
girl

dog
et

he
did
yes

know
said
jane
between
small
sobs
it
died
and
we
have
any
the
dog
had
et
it
well
now
phronsie
exclaimed
king
getting
away
from
the
support
of
the
cabinet
i
think
it
time
that
we
should
make
some
of
these
children
happy
do
you
want
to
take
them
up
to
the
playroom
and
distribute
the
dolls
no

protested
phronsie
suddenly
i
must
go
up
and
tell
my
children
they
will
understand
it
better
then
grandpapa
i
be
back
in
a
very
few
minutes
and
going
out
she
went
quickly
upstairs
and
after
a
while
returned
with
both
arms
full
this
doll
is
for
you
she
said
gravely
putting
a
doll
attired
in
a
wonderful
pink
satin
costume
into
jane
arms
i
told
her
about
your
dog
and
she
a
little
frightened
so
please
be
careful
what
the
fun
down
there
now
asked
joel
of
van
who
with
percy
could
not
be
persuaded
to
leave
his
bedside
a
moment
open
the
door
do
and
let
hear
it
so
van
threw
wide
the
door
go
out
and
listen
percy
will
you
he
said
i
do
want
to
said
percy
who
shared
van
wish
to
keep

the
background

joel
now
if
you
want
me
to
get
well
go
out
do
and
tell
me
what
the
fun
is
going
on
down
there
so
persuaded
the
two
boys
stole
out
into
the
hall
in
time
to
see
phronsie
go
down
the
stairs
with
her
armful
and
carefully
using
their
ears
they
soon
rushed
back
with
phronsie
giving
away
her
dolls
stuff
and
nonsense
exclaimed
joel
if
you
ca
bring
back
anything
better
than
that
yarn
you
might
as
well
stay
here
but
i
tell
you
it
true
declared
van
is
it
percy
yes
it
is
said
percy
i
heard
her
distinctly
say
doll

for
you
and
she
had
her
arms
full
so
i
suppose
she
going
to
give
those
away
too
a
likely
story
said
joel
bursting
into
a
laugh
at
the
noise
up
in
the
boys
room
mother
fisher
ran
quickly
over
the
stairs
oh
boys
what
is
it
joel
are
you
worse
no
indeed
said
joel
i
was
laughing
percy
and
van
have
been
telling
such
a
big
story
mamsie
they
actually
said
that
phronsie
was
giving
away
her
dolls
is
that
all
cried
fisher
in
relief
well
so
she
is
joel
phronsie
giving
away
her
dolls
mamsie
screamed
joel
why
what
does
grandpapa
say
he
the
very
one
that
proposed
it
said
fisher
there
joey
do
get
excited
for
i
do
know
what
the
doctor
will
say
as
joel
sank
back
on
his
pillow
overcome
by
this
last
piece
of
news
when
phronsie
went
to
bed
that
night
she
clasped
king
new
gift
to
her
breast
grandpapa
dear
she
said
confidingly
as
they
went
up
the
stairs
together
do
you
know
i
really
think
more
of
this
doll
now
that
the
others
are
gone
really
i
do
grandpapa
and
i
can
take
better
care
of
her
because
i
shall
have
more
time
so
you
will
dear
assented
king
well
phronsie
i
think
you
and
i
dear
have
made
a
bad
day
work
i
think
my
children
will
be
happy
said
phronsie
with
a
small
sigh
because
you
see
it
so
nice
to
make
good
times
for
their
new
mothers
and
grandpapa
i
could
play
with
each
one
more
than
once
a
week
i
used
to
try
to
but
i
could
grandpapa
why
did
you
tell
me
phronsie
asked
the
old
gentleman
a
bit
reproachfully
as
they
reached
the
top
step
how
it
was
dear
you
should
have
given
them
away
long
ago
ah
but
said
phronsie
slowly
shaking
her
head
i
did
want
to
give
them
away
before
only
just
now
grandpapa
and
i
think
they
will
be
happy
and
now
i
going
to
take
this
newest
one
to
bed
just
as
i
used
to
take
things
to
bed
years
ago
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
after
all
there
was
an
extension
of
time
for
the
three
vacation
marks
not
getting
up
from
his
sudden
attack
of
fever
as
quickly
as
was
expected
but
there
came
a
day
at
last
when
percy
van
and
david
bade
joel
it
wo
be
for
long
observed
that
individual
cheerfully
you
be
back
in
three
weeks
o
dear
groaned
percy
when
safe
within
the
coach
we
ruined
all
his
chances
he
certainly
will
be
plucked
now
with
those
three
weeks
to
make
up
van
gathered
himself
up
and
leaned
forward
in
his
corner
do
look
so
dave
he
cried
desperately
david
tried
to
smooth
the
troubled
lines
out
of
his
face
but
only
succeeded
in
making
it
look
worse
than
before
and
it
will
kill
fisher
percy
continued
gloomily
if
he
does
get
plucked
as
of
course
he
will
keep
still
will
you
cried
van
his
irritation
getting
beyond
bounds
what
the
use
of
talking
about
a
thing
till
it
done
which
had
the
effect
to
make
percy
remember
his
promise
to
polly
and
close
his
mouth
but
joel
wound
healed
quicker
than
any
one
supposed
it
possibly
could
and
percy
and
van
who
both
hated
to
write
letters
gave
up
much
time
on
the
playground
to
indite
daily
bulletins
so
that
he
declared
that
it
was
almost
as
good
as
being
there
on
the
spot
and
mother
fisher
and
her
army
of
servants
cleaned
the
great
stone
house
from
top
to
bottom
and
sorted
and
packed
away
and
made
things
tidy
for
the
new
housekeeper
who
was
to
care
for
them
in
her
absence
till
fisher
raised
his
eyebrows
and
hands
in
astonishment
i
really
must
he
said
one
day
put
in
a
remonstrance
wife
or
you
kill
yourself
before
we
start
oh
i
used
to
working
fisher
would
say
cheerily
and
then
off
she
would
fly
to
something
so
much
worse
that
the
little
doctor
was
speechless
and
polly
set
herself
at
all
her
studies
especially
french
with
redoubled
vigor
notwithstanding
that
she
was
hampered
with
the
faithful
attentions
of
the
schoolgirls
who
fought
among
themselves
for
her
company
and
showered
her
with
pathetic
o
dear
me
ow
i
shall
miss
you
and
with
tears
when
they
got
over
it
and
jasper
buried
himself
in
his
den
only
bursting
forth
at
meal
times
and
whitney
bemoaned
all
preparations
for
the
travelers
departure
and
wished
a
thousand
times
that
she
had
not
given
her
promise
to
keep
the
house
and
look
after
the
boys
and
everybody
who
had
the
slightest
claim
to
a
calling
acquaintance
now
dropped
in
upon
the
kings
and
polly
had
her
party
and
it
was
pronounced
perfectly
elegant
by
alexia
and
her
set
and
the
three
boys
came
home
for
the
long
vacation
and
in
two
days
the
party
would
sail
who
do
you
think
is
going
abroad
with
us
asked
king
suddenly
as
they
all
sat
in
the
library
for
a
last
evening
talk
guess
quickly
who
cried
several
voices
why
i
thought
you
did
want
any
outsiders
father
exclaimed
jasper
in
surprise
well
and
i
did
when
i
said
so
but
circumstances
are
changed
now
come
guess
quickly
some
one
the
cabots
said
jasper
at
a
venture
no
no
guess
again
mr
alstyne
no
again
the
bayleys
the
dyces
the
herrings
shouted
whitney
and
van
and
joel
no
i
know
broke
in
percy
it
chatterton
with
a
quick
glance
to
make
sure
that
she
was
not
in
the
room
no
thundered
king
oh
how
stupid
people
can
be
when
they
want
to
two
persons
are
to
meet
us
in
new
york
i
did
tell
you
till
i
was
sure
i
had
no
desire
that
you
should
be
disappointed
now
guess
again
auntie
do
you
know
asked
polly
suddenly
leaning
back
as
she
sat
on
the
rug
in
front
of
the
fire
to
lay
her
head
in
whitney
lap
no
i
sure
i
do
said
whitney
stroking
lightly
the
brown
hair
with
a
pang
to
think
how
long
it
would
be
before
she
should
caress
it
again
how
any
one
can
desire
to
cross
the
ocean
remarked
whitney
folding
his
hands
back
of
his
head
and
regarding
meditatively
the
glowing
fire
is
more
than
i
can
see
that
i
never
shall
do
it
again
unless
whipped
over
i
morally
certain
are
the
persons
men
asked
ben
suddenly
one
is
replied
king
and
the
other
is
a
woman
the
other
is
a
woman
said
king
well
what
are
their
names
is
anybody
smart
enough
to
guess
them
dear
me
i
always
said
that
the
peppers
were
remarkably
bright
and
the
rest
of
you
children
are
not
behind
other
young
people
go
on
try
again
now
who
are
they
polly
took
her
head
out
of
whitney
lap
and
rested
her
chin
in
her
hands
davie
walked
up
and
down
the
room
while
ben
and
the
two
whitney
boys
hung
over
mother
fisher
chair
dear
me
fumed
joel
who
ever
could
guess
there
such
a
lot
or
people
in
the
world
that
grandpapa
knows
it
might
be
any
two
of
them
that
he
had
asked
little
fisher
eyes
roved
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
group
i
could
begin
to
guess
because
i
do
know
many
of
your
friends
he
said
quietly
you
know
these
two
people
very
well
said
king
laughing
to
see
the
little
man
face
now
i
think
i
know
said
jasper
slowly
a
light
coming
into
his
gray
eyes
but
i
do
suppose
it
fair
to
guess
for
i
saw
the
address
on
a
letter
father
was
writing
two
or
three
weeks
ago
you
did
you
young
scamp
you
cried
king
turning
on
him
well
then
is
a
guess
for
you
jasper
keep
still
my
boy
and
let
them
work
away
at
it
will
no
one
guess
mamsie
cried
polly
bounding
up
from
the
ring
nearly
upsetting
phronsie
who
was
sitting
beside
her
in
a
brown
study
can
it
be
do
you
suppose
it
is
nice
dear
and
mrs
henderson
well
polly
said
king
beaming
at
her
you
done
what
the
others
could
yes
it
is
and
henderson
and
they
are
going
with
us
to
stay
until
the
autumn
good
good
cried
every
one
till
the
big
room
seemed
full
of
joy
oh
father
exclaimed
whitney
i
so
glad
you
done
this
they
were
so
kind
to
dicky
and
to
me
when
he
was
hurt
they
were
kind
to
dicky
and
to
you
said
her
father
and
besides
marian
henderson
is
a
man
who
does
preach
at
you
only
once
a
week
and
henderson
is
a
fine
woman
so
it
a
pity
not
to
ease
up
things
for
them
now
and
then
well
how
do
you
like
the
plan
he
spoke
to
fisher
but
his
gaze
took
them
all
in
immensely
said
the
little
doctor
which
being
again
echoed
heartily
by
all
the
rest
old
king
began
to
feel
very
much
elated
at
his
part
in
the
proceedings
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
seemed
as
if
the
expedition
had
been
especially
planned
for
the
benefit
of
the
hendersons
so
naturally
had
it
all
come
about
and
on
the
morrow
the
whole
family
kings
whitneys
fishers
and
peppers
turned
their
backs
on
the
gray
stone
mansion
and
went
down
to
the
city
and
alexia
rhys
persuaded
her
aunt
to
do
her
shopping
at
this
time
and
to
take
her
too
and
alstyne
also
had
business
that
necessitated
his
going
and
cabot
and
mary
taylor
and
her
father
found
they
must
go
along
too
and
hamilton
dyce
was
there
and
pickering
dodge
of
course
went
to
be
company
for
ben
on
the
way
back
and
at
the
last
moment
who
should
jump
on
the
train
but
livingston
bayley
had
a
telegram
he
explained
must
be
there
at
noon
so
glad
of
the
unexpected
pleasure
of
meeting
you
all
and
cousin
eunice
chatterton
went
for
at
the
last
minute
she
had
suddenly
discovered
that
she
had
visited
at
the
gray
stone
mansion
as
long
as
she
cared
to
and
notified
the
family
accordingly
and
king
had
so
far
made
up
for
his
part
in
the
late
unpleasantness
as
to
ask
her
to
go
with
the
party
on
her
way
to
her
nephew
in
the
city
so
there
she
was
with
the
others
bidding
them
on
the
steamer
phronsie
she
said
slowly
under
cover
of
the
babel
of
tongues
you
are
a
good
child
and
i
done
well
by
you
this
little
bit
of
paper
putting
it
into
her
hands
contains
a
message
to
king
which
you
are
to
give
him
after
you
have
started
i
will
go
and
give
it
to
him
now
said
phronsie
her
fingers
closing
over
the
bit
no
no
said
chatterton
sharply
do
as
i
say
remember
on
no
account
to
let
any
one
see
it
till
after
you
have
started
you
are
a
good
child
phronsie
now
remember
to
do
as
you
are
bidden
and
now
will
you
kiss
me
child
phronsie
lifted
her
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
the
long
white
face
and
suddenly
raising
herself
on
her
tiptoes
she
put
up
her
lips
look
at
phron
cried
joel
in
the
midst
of
the
group
actually
kissing
mrs
chatterton
and
everybody
turned
and
stared
cousin
eunice
dropped
her
veil
with
a
quick
hand
and
moved
off
with
a
stately
step
but
not
in
time
to
lose
young
bayley
drawl
me
word
it
the
most
extraordinary
thing
phronsie
come
here
and
tell
us
what
was
like
but
phronsie
stood
quite
still
as
if
she
had
not
heard
yes
i
hope
you
have
a
nice
time
pickering
dodge
was
saying
for
the
dozenth
time
with
eyes
for
no
one
but
polly
now
do
stay
away
for
a
year
polly
with
her
heart
full
of
the
boys
who
were
hanging
on
either
side
answered
at
random
oh
ben
i
ca
go
she
was
exclaiming
and
she
hid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
so
pickering
turned
off
but
joel
set
his
teeth
together
you
must
he
said
for
ben
was
beyond
speech
with
the
effort
to
control
himself
i
ca
said
poor
polly
leave
you
ben
and
the
boys
and
then
whitney
came
up
just
as
polly
was
near
breaking
down
my
dear
child
she
said
taking
polly
hands
you
know
it
is
right
for
you
to
go
yes
i
know
said
polly
fighting
her
tears
then
polly
be
brave
dear
and
do
begrudge
me
my
three
new
boys
she
added
playfully
just
think
how
happy
i
to
be
with
six
such
splendid
fellows
to
call
my
own
polly
smiled
through
her
tears
and
one
thing
more
said
whitney
in
a
low
voice
when
you
feel
badly
looking
steadily
at
polly
and
the
three
boys
remember
what
fisher
said
that
if
your
mother
did
stop
working
and
rest
she
would
break
down
i
remember
said
ben
hoarsely
so
will
i
said
david
and
i
will
said
joel
looking
everywhere
but
into
polly
eyes
well
i
hope
miss
polly
said
young
bayley
sauntering
up
that
you
have
an
uncommonly
nice
time
i
do
indeed
i
may
run
across
in
september
if
i
do
we
shall
probably
meet
miss
mary
pepper
suddenly
asked
a
man
with
a
huge
basket
of
flowers
and
pausing
in
front
of
her
young
bayley
smiled
indulgently
as
he
could
not
help
reading
the
card
thrust
into
the
flowers
she
will
receive
my
flowers
at
intervals
all
the
way
over
if
the
steward
does
fail
me
he
reflected
with
satisfaction
while
this
boy
will
fade
in
an
hour
miss
mary
pepper
the
florist
messenger
repeated
extending
the
basket
to
polly
it
for
you
miss
polly
said
young
bayley
let
me
relieve
you
taking
the
basket
oh

for
me
cried
polly
i
believe
you
are
miss
mary
pepper
said
young
bayley
pretty
are
they
fingering
the
roses
and
glad
to
think
that
there
were
orchids
among
the
flowers
to
which
his
card
was
attached
and
just
placed
under
the
steward
care
i
suppose
i
am
said
polly
with
a
little
laugh
but
it
seems
as
if
i
could
be
anything
but
polly
pepper
oh
thank
you
pickering
for
these
lovely
roses
catching
sight
of
him
glad

pickering
radiantly
say
polly

away
a
whole
year

young
bayley
set
the
basket
in
his
hand
and
turned
on
his
heel
with
a
smile
come

cried
alexia
trying
to
draw
her
off
you
know
she
my
very
best
friend
pickering
and
i
have
had
a
chance
to
say
one
word
to
her
this
morning
come
polly
polly

here

fisher
o
dear
cried
alexia
impatiently
now
that
just
the
way
it
always
is
it
polly
here
and
polly
there
as
polly
deserted
her
and
ran
off
with
her
basket
of
roses
you
do
do
any
of
the
calling
of
course
said
pickering
with
a
laugh
well
i
have

to

declared
alexia
savagely
before
time
for
us
to
get
off
the
steamer

if
i
do

believe
it
said
pickering
look
at
her
now
in
a
maelstrom
of
relatives
you
and
i
alexia
are
left
out
and
the
next
thing
alexia
knew
somebody
unceremoniously
helped
her
from
the
steamer
with
a
beg
pardon
miss
but
you
must
get
off
and
she
was
standing
on
the
wharf
in
a
crowd
of
people
looking
in
a
dazed
way
at
polly
pepper
fluttering
handkerchief
while
little
ripples
of
greenish
water
lay
between
them
and
phronsie
was
running
up
to
king
here
grandpapa
chatterton
wanted
me
to
give
you
this
unclasping
her
warm
little
palm
where
the
bit
of
white
paper
