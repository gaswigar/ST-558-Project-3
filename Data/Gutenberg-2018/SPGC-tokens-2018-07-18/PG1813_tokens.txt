a
man
of
business
the
word
is
a
euphemism
invented
to
describe
the
status
of
a
personage
or
a
personage
of
a
status
of
which
it
is
awkward
to
speak
the
french
academie
in
its
modesty
having
omitted
to
supply
a
definition
out
of
regard
for
the
age
of
its
forty
members
whenever
a
new
word
comes
to
supply
the
place
of
an
unwieldy
circumlocution
its
fortune
is
assured
the
word
has
passed
into
the
language
of
every
class
of
society
even
where
the
lorette
herself
will
never
gain
an
entrance
it
was
only
invented
in
and
derived
beyond
a
doubt
from
the
agglomeration
of
such
swallows
nests
about
the
church
of
our
lady
of
loretto
this
information
is
for
etymoligists
only
those
gentlemen
would
not
be
so
often
in
a
quandary
if
mediaeval
writers
had
only
taken
such
pains
with
details
of
contemporary
manners

we

her
pseudonym

was
one
of
the
earliest
parishioners
of
that
charming
church
at
the
time
to
which
this
story
belongs
that
lighthearted
and
lively
damsel
gladdened
the
existence
of
a
notary
with
a
wife
somewhat
too
bigoted
rigid
and
frigid
for
domestic
happiness
now
it
so
fell
out
that
one
carnival
evening
maitre
cardot
was
entertaining
guests
at
mlle
turquet
s
house
desroches
the
attorney
bixiou
of
the
caricatures
lousteau
the
journalist
nathan
and
others
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
give
any
further
description
of
these
personages
all
bearers
of
illustrious
names
in
the
young
la
palferine
in
spite
of
his
title
of
count
and
his
great
descent
which
alas
means
a
great
descent
in
fortune
likewise
had
honored
the
notary
s
little
establishment
with
his
presence
at
dinner
in
such
a
house
one
does
not
expect
to
meet
the
patriarchal
beef
the
skinny
fowl
and
salad
of
domestic
and
family
life
nor
is
there
any
attempt
at
the
hypocritical
conversation
of
furnished
with
highly
respectable
matrons
when
alas
will
respectability
be
charming
when
will
the
women
in
good
society
vouchsafe
to
show
rather
less
of
their
shoulders
and
rather
more
wit
or
geniality
marguerite
turquet
the
aspasia
of
the
is
one
of
those
frank
very
living
personalities
to
whom
all
is
forgiven
such
unconscious
sinners
are
they
such
intelligent
penitents
of
such
as
malaga
one
might
ask
like
cardot
a
witty
man
enough
albeit
a
notary
to
be
well
and
yet
you
must
not
think
that
any
enormities
were
committed
desroches
and
cardot
were
good
fellows
grown
too
gray
in
the
profession
not
to
feel
at
ease
with
bixiou
lousteau
nathan
and
young
la
palferine
and
they
on
their
side
had
too
often
had
recourse
to
their
legal
advisers
and
knew
them
too
well
to
try
to
draw
them
out
in
lorette
language
conversation
perfumed
with
seven
cigars
at
first
was
as
fantastic
as
a
kid
let
loose
but
finally
it
settled
down
upon
the
strategy
of
the
constant
war
waged
in
paris
between
creditors
and
debtors
now
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
recall
the
history
and
antecedents
of
the
guests
you
will
know
that
in
all
paris
you
could
scarcely
find
a
group
of
men
with
more
experience
in
this
matter
the
professional
men
on
one
hand
and
the
artists
on
the
other
were
something
in
the
position
of
magistrates
and
criminals
hobnobbing
together
a
set
of
bixiou
s
drawings
to
illustrate
life
in
the
debtors
prison
led
the
conversation
to
take
this
particular
turn
and
from
debtors
prisons
they
went
to
debts
it
was
midnight
they
had
broken
up
into
little
knots
round
the
table
and
before
the
fire
and
gave
themselves
up
to
the
burlesque
fun
which
is
only
possible
or
comprehensible
in
paris
and
in
that
particular
region
which
is
bounded
by
the
faubourg
montmartre
the
rue
chaussee
d
antin
the
upper
end
of
the
rue
de
navarin
and
the
line
of
the
boulevards
in
ten
minutes
time
they
had
come
to
an
end
of
all
the
deep
reflections
all
the
moralizings
small
and
great
all
the
bad
puns
made
on
a
subject
already
exhausted
by
rabelais
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
it
was
not
a
little
to
their
credit
that
the
pyrotechnic
display
was
cut
short
with
a
final
squib
from
malaga
it
all
goes
to
the
shoemakers

said
i
left
a
milliner
because
she
failed
twice
with
my
hats

vixen

been
here
times
to
ask
for
twenty
francs
she
did
not
know
that
we
never
have
twenty
francs
one
has
a
thousand
francs
or
one
sends
to
one
s
notary
for
five
hundred
but
twenty
francs
i
have
never
had
in
my
life
my
cook
and
my
maid
may
perhaps
have
so
much
between
them
but
for
my
own
part
i
have
nothing
but
credit
and
i
should
lose
that
if
i
took
to
borrowing
small
sums
if
i
were
to
ask
for
twenty
francs
i
should
have
nothing
to
distinguish
me
from
my
colleagues

oh
come
now
are
you
turning
stupid

she
with
a
wink
she
came
this
morning
for
the
time
that
is
how
i
came
to
mention
what
did
you
do
asked
desroches
i
took
pity
upon
her
and
ordered
a
little
hat
that
i
have
just
invented
a
quite
new
shape
if
mlle
amanda
succeeds
with
it
she
will
say
no
more
about
the
money
her
fortune
is
in
my
opinion
put
in
desroches
the
finest
things
that
i
have
seen
in
a
duel
of
this
kind
give
those
who
know
paris
a
far
better
picture
of
the
city
than
all
the
fancy
portraits
that
they
paint
some
of
you
think
that
you
know
a
thing
or
two

glancing
round
at

lousteau
but
the
king
of

is
a
certain
count

busy
ranging
himself
in

to

in

the
principles
that

the

cabinet
up
to

of
his

one
continual

no
one
continued
desroches
but
as
your
friend
bixiou
was
saying
just
now
it
is
a
violation
of
the
liberty
of
the
subject
to
be
made
to
pay
in
march
when
you
have
no
mind
to
pay
till
october
by
virtue
of

of
his
particular
code

regarded
a

for
making
him

as
a

trick

was
a
long
time
since
he
had
grasped
the
significance
of
the
bill
of

in
all
its
bearings
direct
and
remote
a
young
man
once
in
my
place
called

his
hearing
no
said

it
is
the
bridge
of
sighs
it
is
the
shortest
way
to
an
indeed
his
knowledge
of
commercial
law
was
so
complete
that
a
professional
could
not
have
taught
him
anything
at
that
time
he
had
nothing
as
you
know
his
carriage
and
horses
were
jobbed
he
lived
in
his
valet
s
house
and
by
the
way
he
will
be
a
hero
to
his
valet
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
even
after
the
marriage
that
he
proposes
to
make

to
three
clubs
and
dined
at
one
of
them
whenever
he
did
not
dine
out
as
a
rule
he
was
to
be
found
very
seldom
at
his
own
address

once
said

one
affectation

the
pretence

now
for

bixiou

his
locks

they
stood
on
end
gifted
with
the
same
talent
for
mimicking
absurdities
which
chopin
the
pianist
possesses
to
so
high
a
degree
he
proceeded
forthwith
to
represent
the
character
with
startling
truth
he
rolls
his
head
like
this
when
he

he
was
once
a

for
six

as
man
of
straw
cat
s
paw
and
scapegoat
to
two
friends
of
ours
du
tillet
and
nucingen
but
in
his
part
was
so
well
known
that
our
friends
dropped
him
put
in
bixiou
they
left
him
to
his
fate
at
last
and
he
wallowed
in
the
mire
continued
desroches
in
he
went
into
partnership
with
one
cerizet
what
he
that
promoted
a
company
so
nicely
that
the
sixth
chamber
cut
short
his
career
with
a
couple
of
years
in
jail
asked
the
lorette
the
same
under
the
restoration
between
and
cerizet
s
occupation
consisted
in
first
putting
his
name
intrepidly
to
various
paragraphs
on
which
the
public
prosecutor
fastened
with
avidity
and
subsequently
marching
off
to
prison
a
man
could
make
a
name
for
himself
with
small
expense
in
those
days
the
liberal
party
called
their
provincial
champion
the
courageous
cerizet
and
towards
so
much
zeal
received
its
reward
in
general
general
interest
is
a
kind
of
civic
crown
bestowed
on
the
deserving
by
the
daily
press
cerizet
tried
to
discount
the
general
interest
taken
in
him
he
came
to
paris
and
with
some
help
from
capitalists
in
the
opposition
started
as
a
broker
and
conducted
financial
operations
to
some
extent
the
capital
being
found
by
a
man
in
hiding
a
skilful
gambler
who
overreached
himself
and
in
consequence
in
july
his
capital
foundered
in
the
shipwreck
of
the
oh
it
was
he
whom
we
used
to
call
the
system
cried
bixiou
say
no
harm
of
him
poor
fellow
protested
malaga
d
estourny
was
a
good
you
can
imagine
the
part
that
a
ruined
man
was
sure
to
play
in
when
his
name
in
politics
was
the
courageous
he
was
sent
off
into
a
very
snug
little
unluckily
for
him
it
is
one
thing
to
be
in
opposition
any
missile
is
good
enough
to
throw
so
long
as
the
flight
lasts
but
quite
another
to
be
in
office
three
months
later
he
was
obliged
to
send
in
his
resignation
had
he
not
taken
it
into
his
head
to
attempt
to
win
popularity
still
as
he
had
done
nothing
as
yet
to
imperil
his
title
of
courageous
cerizet
the
government
proposed
by
way
of
compensation
that
he
should
manage
a
newspaper
nominally
an
opposition
newspaper
but
ministerialist
so
the
fall
of
this
noble
nature
was
really
due
to
the
government
to
cerizet
as
manager
of
the
paper
it
was
rather
too
evident
that
he
was
as
a
bird
perched
on
a
rotten
bough
and
then
it
was
that
he
promoted
that
nice
little
company
and
thereby
secured
a
couple
of
years
in
prison
he
was
caught
while
more
ingenious
swindlers
succeeded
in
catching
the
we
are
acquainted
with
the
more
ingenious
said
bixiou
let
us
say
no
ill
of
the
poor
fellow
he
was
nabbed
couture
allowed
them
to
squeeze
his
who
would
ever
have
thought
it
of
him
at
all
events
cerizet
was
a
low
sort
of
fellow
a
good
deal
damaged
by
low
debauchery
now
for
the
duel
i
spoke
about
never
did
two
tradesmen
of
the
worst
type
with
the
worst
manners
the
lowest
pair
of
villains
imaginable
go
into
partnership
in
a
dirtier
business
their
consisted
of
the
peculiar
idiom
of
the
man
about
town
the
audacity
of
poverty
the
cunning
that
comes
of
experience
and
a
special
knowledge
of
parisian
capitalists
their
origin
connections
acquaintances
and
intrinsic
value
this
partnership
of
two
dabblers
let
the
stock
exchange
term
pass
for
it
is
the
only
word
which
describes
them
this
partnership
of
dabblers
did
not
last
very
long
they
fought
like
famished
curs
over
every
bit
of
garbage
the
earlier
speculations
of
the
firm
of
cerizet
and
claparon
were
however
well
planned
the
two
scamps
joined
forces
with
barbet
chaboisseau
samanon
and
usurers
of
that
stamp
and
bought
up
hopelessly
bad
debts
claparon
s
place
of
business
at
that
time
was
a
cramped
entresol
in
the
rue
chabannais
five
rooms
at
a
rent
of
seven
hundred
francs
at
most
each
partner
slept
in
a
little
closet
so
carefully
closed
from
prudence
that
my
could
never
get
inside
the
furniture
of
the
other
three
rooms
an
a
and
a
private
office
would
not
have
fetched
three
hundred
francs
altogether
at
a
sale
you
know
enough
of
paris
to
know
the
look
of
it
the
stuffed
chairs
a
table
covered
with
a
green
cloth
a
trumpery
clock
between
a
couple
of
candle
sconces
growing
tarnished
under
glass
shades
the
small
mirror
over
the
and
in
the
grate
a
charred
stick
or
two
of
firewood
which
had
lasted
them
for
two
winters
as
my
put
it
as
for
the
office
you
can
guess
what
it
was
like
more
than
business
letters
a
set
of
common
for
either
partner
a
cylinder
desk
empty
as
the
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
a
couple
of
armchairs
on
either
side
of
a
coal
fire
the
carpet
on
the
floor
was
bought
cheap
at
like
the
bills
and
bad
debts
in
short
it
was
the
mahogany
furniture
of
furnished
apartments
which
usually
descends
from
one
occupant
of
chambers
to
another
during
fifty
years
of
service
now
you
know
the
pair
of
antagonists
during
the
first
three
months
of
a
partnership
dissolved
four
months
later
in
a
bout
of
fisticuffs
cerizet
and
claparon
bought
up
two
thousand
francs
worth
of
bills
bearing
maxime
s
signature
since
maxime
was
his
name
and
filled
a
couple
of
letters
to
bursting
with
judgments
appeals
orders
of
the
court
application
for
stay
of
proceedings
and
all
the
rest
of
it
to
put
it
briefly
they
had
bills
for
three
thousand
two
hundred
francs
odd
centimes
for
which
they
had
given
five
hundred
francs
the
transfer
being
made
under
private
seal
with
special
power
of
attorney
to
save
the
expense
of
registration
now
it
so
happened
at
this
juncture
maxime
being
of
ripe
age
was
seized
with
one
of
the
fancies
peculiar
to
the
man
of
fifty
antonia
exclaimed
la
palferine
that
antonia
whose
fortune
i
made
by
writing
to
ask
for
a
toothbrush
her
real
name
is
chocardelle
said
malaga
not
over
well
pleased
by
the
pseudonym
the
same
continued
desroches
it
was
the
only
mistake
maxime
ever
made
in
his
life
but
what
would
you
have
no
vice
is
absolutely
perfect
put
in
bixiou
maxime
had
still
to
learn
what
sort
of
a
life
a
man
may
be
led
into
by
a
girl
of
eighteen
when
she
is
minded
to
take
a
header
from
her
honest
garret
into
a
sumptuous
carriage
it
is
a
lesson
that
all
statesmen
should
take
to
heart
at
this
time

marsay
had
just
been
employing
his
friend
our
friend

the
high
comedy
of

looked
high
for

years

i

for
he

where

was
a

of

possessed
of
forty
thousand

after
the

of

was
delivered
of
a
pun
you
lend

but
i
give
you
plenty
of

in

said
he
a
few
days
later
he
put
on
a
knowing
little
air
as
much
as
to
say
i
know
you
are
engaged
but
my
turn
will
come
one
day
i

on
the
double

took
occasion
to
confide
to
the
young

some
few
days
after

visit
to

i
hold
my

in
horror
they
are
peasants
born
to
work
in

just
imagine
it
i
came
up
from
the
country
with
six
francs
in
my
pocket
and
made
my
fortune
here
i
am
not
proud
a
pretty

my

now
would
it
not
be
nicer
to
be

some
years
to

to

for
a
twelvemonth
he

go
off
and
leave
you
some
time
or
other
and
when
that
day
comes
you
will
think
of

my

all
this
was
simmering
below
the
surface
the
slightest
approach
at
was
made
quite
on
the
sly
not
a
soul
suspected
that
the
trim
little
old
fogy
was
smitten
with
antonia
and
so
prudent
was
the
elderly
lover
that
no
rival
could
have
guessed
anything
from
his
behavior
in
the
for
a
couple
of
months
croizeau
watched
the
retired
official
but
before
the
third
month
was
out
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
his
suspicions
were
groundless
he
exerted
his
ingenuity
to
scrape
an
acquaintance
with
denisart
came
up
with
him
in
the
street
and
at
length
seized
his
opportunity
to
remark
it
is
a
fine
day
sir
whereupon
the
retired
official
responded
with
austerlitz
weather
sir
i
was
there
myself
i
was
wounded
indeed
i
won
my
cross
on
that
glorious
and
so
from
one
thing
to
another
the
two
drifted
wrecks
of
the
empire
struck
up
an
acquaintance
little
croizeau
was
attached
to
the
empire
through
his
connection
with
napoleon
s
sisters
he
had
been
their
and
had
frequently
dunned
them
for
money
so
he
gave
out
that
he
had
had
relations
with
the
imperial
maxime
duly
informed
by
antonia
of
the
nice
old
man
s
proposals
for
so
the
aunt
called
croizeau
wished
to
see
him
cerizet
s
declaration
of
war
had
so
far
taken
effect
that
he
of
the
yellow
kid
gloves
was
studying
the
position
of
every
piece
however
insignificant
upon
the
board
and
it
so
happened
that
at
the
mention
of
that
nice
old
man
an
ominous
tinkling
sounded
in
his
ears
one
evening
therefore
maxime
seated
himself
among
the
in
the
dimly
lighted
back
room
reconnoitred
the
seven
or
eight
customers
through
the
chink
between
the
green
curtains
and
took
the
little
s
measure
he
gauged
the
man
s
infatuation
and
was
very
well
satisfied
to
find
that
the
varnished
doors
of
a
tolerably
sumptuous
future
were
ready
to
turn
at
a
word
from
antonia
so
soon
as
his
own
fancy
had
passed
off
and
that
other
one
yonder
asked
he
pointing
out
the
stout
elderly
man
with
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
who
is
he
a
retired
the
cut
of
his
countenance
is
not
reassuring
said
maxime
beholding
the
sieur
denisart
and
indeed
the
old
soldier
held
himself
upright
as
a
steeple
his
head
was
remarkable
for
the
amount
of
powder
and
pomatum
bestowed
upon
it
he
looked
almost
like
a
postilion
at
a
fancy
ball
underneath
that
felted
covering
moulded
to
the
top
of
the
wearer
s
cranium
appeared
an
elderly
profile
with
a
comical
admixture
of
arrogance
altogether
something
like
caricatures
of
the
the
sometime
official
finding
that
age
and
and
the
conformation
of
his
spine
made
it
impossible
to
read
a
word
without
spectacles
sat
displaying
a
very
creditable
expanse
of
chest
with
all
the
pride
of
an
old
man
with
a
mistress
like
old
general
montcornet
that
pillar
of
the
vaudeville
he
wore

denisart
was
partial
to

his

were
both
of

how
long
is
it
since
that
old
fogy
came
here
inquired
maxime
thinking
that
he
saw
danger
in
the
spectacles
oh
from
the
beginning
returned

pretty
nearly
two
months
ago
good
said
maxime
to
himself
cerizet
only
came
to
me
a

just
get
him
to
talk
he
added
in
antonia
s
ear
i
want
to
hear
his
pshaw
said
she
that
is
not
so
easy
he
never
says
a
word
to
then
why
does
he
come
here
demanded
maxime
for
a
queer
reason
returned
the
fair
antonia
in
the
first
place
although
he
is
he
has
a
fancy
and
because
he
is

is
as
methodical
as

goes

for

at

steadily
at

for
four
hours
and
goes
back
at

says
that
he
knows
denisart

motives
and
approves
his
conduct
and
in
his

he
would
do
the

so
i
know
exactly
what
to
expect
if
ever
i
am
mme

i
shall
have
four
hours
to

daddy

him
to

taken
out
in

thought
the
uncommonly
green
croizeau
might
pay
all

get
nothing

felt
more

opened

that

what
ought
to
have
my
pretty

that
is
what
i
should
like
to
offer
you
he
would
conclude
i
am
quite
aware
that
you
scarcely
care
a
bit
about
me
but
at
my
age
we
can
not
expect
too
much
judge
how
much
i
love
you
i
have
lent
you
a
thousand
francs
i
must
confess
that
in
all
my
born
days
i
have
not
lent
anybody
much
he
held
out
his
penny
as
he
spoke
with
the
important
air
of
a
man
that
gives
a
learned
demonstration
that
evening
at
the
varietes
antonia
spoke
to
the
count
a

very
dull
all
the
same
said
she
i
feel
that
i
have
no
sort
of
taste
for
that
kind
of
life
and
i
see
no
future
in
it
it
is
only
fit
for
a
widow
that
wishes
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
or
for
some
hideously
ugly
thing
that
fancies
she
can
catch
a
husband
with
a
little
it
was
your
own
choice
returned
the
count
just
at
that
moment
in
came
nucingen
of
whom
maxime
king
of

the
yellow
kid

were
the
lions
of

day
had

queen
of

smiled
la

looking
at
malaga
thou
art
about
to
lose
thy
once
a
long
time
ago
in
a
similar
case
resumed
desroches
a
too
honest
debtor
took
fright
at
the
idea
of
a
solemn
declaration
in
a
court
of
law
and
declined
to
pay
maxime
after
notice
was
given
that
time
we
made
it
hot
for
the
creditor
by
piling
on
writs
of
attachment
so
as
to
absorb
the
whole
amount
in
costs
oh
what
is
that
cried
malaga
it
all
sounds
like
gibberish
to
me
as
you
thought
the
sturgeon
so
excellent
at
dinner
let
me
take
out
the
value
of
the
sauce
in
lessons
in
very
well
said
desroches
suppose
that
a
man
owes
you
money
and
your
creditors
serve
a
writ
of
attachment
upon
him
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
all
your
other
creditors
from
doing
the
same
thing
and
now
what
does
the
court
do
when
all
the
creditors
make
application
for
orders
to
pay
court
divides
the
whole
sum
attached
proportionately
among
them
that
division
made
under
the
eye
of
a
magistrate
is
what
we
call
a
if
you
owe
ten
thousand
francs
and
your
creditors
issue
writs
of
attachment
on
a
debt
due
to
you
of
a
thousand
francs
each
one
of
them
gets
so
much
per
cent
so
much
in
the
pound
in
legal
phrase
so
much
that
means
in
proportion
to
the
amounts
severally
claimed
by
the
creditors
but
the
creditors
can
not
touch
the
money
without
a
special
order
from
the
clerk
of
the
court
do
you
guess
what
all
this
work
drawn
up
by
a
judge
and
prepared
by
attorneys
must
mean
it
means
a
quantity
of
stamped
paper
full
of
diffuse
lines
and
blanks
the
figures
almost
lost
in
vast
spaces
of
completely
empty
ruled
columns
the
first
proceeding
is
to
deduct
the
costs
now
as
the
costs
are
precisely
the
same
whether
the
amount
attached
is
one
thousand
or
one
million
francs
it
is
not
difficult
to
eat
up
three
thousand
francs
for
instance
in
costs
especially
if
you
can
manage
to
raise
counter
and
an
attorney
always
manages
to
do
it
said
cardot
how
many
a
time
one
of
you
has
come
to
me
with
what
is
there
to
be
got
out
of
the
case
it
is
particularly
easy
to
manage
it
if
the
debtor
eggs
you
on
to
run
up
costs
till
they
eat
up
the
amount
and
as
a
rule
the
count
s
creditors
took
nothing
by
that
move
and
were
out
of
pocket
in
law
and
personal
expenses
to
get
money
out
of
so
experienced
a
debtor
as
the
count
a
creditor
should
really
be
in
a
position
uncommonly
difficult
to
reach
it
is
a
question
of
being
creditor
and
debtor
both
for
then
you
are
legally
entitled
to
work
the
confusion
of
rights
in
law
language
to
the
confusion
of
the
debtor
asked
malaga
lending
an
attentive
ear
to
this
discourse
no
the
confusion
of
rights
of
debtor
and
creditor
and
pay
yourself
through
your
own
hands
so
claparon
s
innocence
in
merely
issuing
writs
of
attachment
eased
the
count
s
mind
as
he
came
back
from
the
varietes
with
antonia
he
was
so
much
the
more
taken
with
the
idea
of
selling
the
to
pay
off
the
last
two
thousand
francs
of
the
because
he
did
not
care
to
have
his
name
made
public
as
a
partner
in
such
a
concern
so
he
adopted
antonia
s
plan
antonia
wished
to
reach
the
higher
ranks
of
her
calling
with
splendid
rooms
a
maid
and
a
carriage
in
short
she
wanted
to
rival
our
charming
hostess
for
instance
she
was
not
woman
enough
for
that
cried
the
famous
beauty
of
the
circus
still
she
ruined
young
d
esgrignon
very
ten
days
afterwards
little
croizeau
perched
on
his
dignity
said
almost
exactly
the
same
thing
for
the
fair
antonia
s
benefit
continued
desroches
child
said
he
your
is
a
hole
of
a
place
you
will
lose
your
complexion
the
gas
will
ruin
your
eyesight
you
ought
to
come
out
of
it
and
look
here
let
us
take
advantage
of
an
opportunity
i
have
found
a
young
lady
for
you
that
asks
no
better
than
to
buy
your
she
is
a
ruined
woman
with
nothing
before
her
but
a
plunge
into
the
river
but
she
had
four
thousand
francs
in
cash
and
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
turn
them
to
account
so
as
to
feed
and
educate
a
couple
of
very
well
it
is
kind
of
you
daddy
croizeau
said
antonia
oh
i
shall
be
much
kinder
before
i
have
done
just
imagine
it
poor
denisart
has
been
worried
into
the
jaundice
yes
it
has
gone
to
the
liver
as
it
usually
does
with
susceptible
old
men
it
is
a
pity
he
feels
things
so
i
told
him
so
myself
i
said
be
passionate
there
is
no
harm
in
that
but
as
for
taking
things
to
heart
draw
the
line
at
that
it
is
the
way
to
kill
really
i
would
not
have
expected
him
to
take
on
so
about
it
a
man
that
has
sense
enough
and
experience
enough
to
keep
away
as
he
does
while
he
digests
his
dinner
but
what
is
the
matter
inquired
mlle
chocardelle
that
little
baggage
with
whom
i
dined
has
cleared
out
and
left
him
yes
gave
him
the
slip
without
any
warning
but
a
letter
in
which
the
spelling
was
all
to
there
daddy
croizeau
you
see
what
comes
of
boring
a
woman
it
is
indeed
a
lesson
my
pretty
lady
said
the
guileful
croizeau
meanwhile
i
have
never
seen
a
man
in
such
a
state
our
friend
denisart
can
not
tell
his
left
hand
from
his
right
he
will
not
go
back
to
look
at
the
scene
of
his
happiness
as
he
calls
it
he
has
so
thoroughly
lost
his
wits
that
he
proposes
that
i
should
buy
all
hortense
s
furniture
hortense
was
her
name
for
four
thousand
a
pretty
name
said
antonia
yes
napoleon
s
stepdaughter
was
called
hortense
i
built
carriages
for
her
as
you
very
well
i
will
see
said
cunning
antonia
begin
by
sending
this
young
woman
to
antonia
hurried
off
to
see
the
furniture
and
came
back
fascinated
she
brought
maxime
under
the
spell
of
antiquarian
enthusiasm
that
very
evening
the
count
agreed
to
the
sale
of
the
the
establishment
you
see
nominally
belonged
to
mlle
chocardelle
maxime
burst
out
laughing
at
the
idea
of
little
croizeau
s
finding
him
a
buyer
the
firm
of
maxime
and
chocardelle
was
losing
two
thousand
francs
it
is
true
but
what
was
the
loss
compared
with
four
glorious
notes
in
hand
four
thousand
francs
of
live
coin
there
are
moments
in
one
s
life
when
one
would
sign
bills
for
eight
thousand
to
get
them
as
the
count
said
to
me
two
days
later
the
count
must
see
the
furniture
himself
and
took
the
four
thousand
francs
upon
him
the
sale
had
been
arranged
thanks
to
little
croizeau
s
diligence
he
pushed
matters
on
he
had
come
round
the
widow
as
he
expressed
it
it
was
maxime
s
intention
to
have
all
the
furniture
removed
at
once
to
a
lodging
in
a
new
house
in
the
rue
tronchet
taken
in
the
name
of
mme
ida
bonamy
he
did
not
trouble
himself
much
about
the
nice
old
man
that
was
about
to
lose
his
thousand
francs
but
he
had
sent
beforehand
for
several
big
furniture
vans
once
again
he
was
fascinated
by
the
beautiful
furniture
which
a
wholesale
dealer
would
have
valued
at
six
thousand
francs
by
the
fireside
sat
the
wretched
owner
yellow
with
jaundice
his
head
tied
up
in
a
couple
of
printed
handkerchiefs
and
a
cotton
on
top
of
them
he
was
huddled
up
in
wrappings
like
a
chandelier
exhausted
unable
to
speak
and
altogether
so
knocked
to
pieces
that
the
count
was
obliged
to
transact
his
business
with
the
when
he
had
paid
down
the
four
thousand
francs
and
the
servant
had
taken
the
money
to
his
master
for
a
receipt
maxime
turned
to
tell
the
man
to
call
up
the
vans
to
the
door
but
even
as
he
spoke
a
voice
like
a
rattle
sounded
in
his
ears
it
is
not
worth
while
monsieur
le
comte
you
and
i
are
quits
i
have
six
hundred
and
thirty
francs
fifteen
centimes
to
give
you
to
his
utter
consternation
he
saw
cerizet
emerged
from
his
wrappings
like
a
butterfly
from
the
chrysalis
holding
out
the
accursed
bundle
of
documents
when
i
was
down
on
my
luck
i
learned
to
act
on
the
stage
added
cerizet
i
am
as
good
as
bouffe
at
old
i
have
fallen
among
thieves
shouted
maxime
no
monsieur
le
comte
you
are
in
mlle
hortense
s
house
she
is
a
friend
of
old
lord
dudley
s
he
keeps
her
hidden
away
here
but
she
has
the
bad
taste
to
like
your
humble
if
ever
i
longed
to
kill
a
man
so
the
count
told
me
afterwards
it
was
at
that
moment
but
what
could
one
do
hortense
showed
her
pretty
face
one
had
to
laugh
to
keep
my
dignity
i
flung
her
the
six
hundred
francs
there
s
for
the
girl
said
that
is
maxime
all
over
cried
la

more
especially
as
it
was

added
cardot
the
profound
maxime
scored

continued
