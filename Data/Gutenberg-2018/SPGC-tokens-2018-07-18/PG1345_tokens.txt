de
balzac
the
vicar
of
tours
i
early
in
the
autumn
of
the
abbe
birotteau
the
principal
personage
of
this
history
was
overtaken
by
a
shower
of
rain
as
he
returned
home
from
a
friend
s
house
where
he
had
been
passing
the
evening
he
therefore
crossed
as
quickly
as
his
corpulence
would
allow
the
deserted
little
square
called
the
cloister
which
lies
directly
behind
the
chancel
of
the
cathedral
of
at
tours
the
abbe
birotteau
a
short
little
man
apoplectic
in
constitution
and
about
sixty
years
old
had
already
gone
through
several
attacks
of
gout
now
among
the
petty
miseries
of
human
life
the
one
for
which
the
worthy
priest
felt
the
deepest
aversion
was
the
sudden
sprinkling
of
his
shoes
adorned
with
silver
buckles
and
the
wetting
of
their
soles
notwithstanding
the
woollen
socks
in
which
at
all
seasons
he
enveloped
his
feet
with
the
extreme
care
that
ecclesiastics
take
of
themselves
he
was
apt
at
such
times
to
get
them
a
little
damp
and
the
next
day
gout
was
sure
to
give
him
certain
infallible
proofs
of
constancy
nevertheless
as
the
pavement
of
the
cloister
was
likely
to
be
dry
and
as
the
abbe
had
won
three
francs
ten
sous
in
his
rubber
with
madame
de
listomere
he
bore
the
rain
resignedly
from
the
middle
of
the
place
de
l
archeveche
where
it
began
to
come
down
in
earnest
besides
he
was
fondling
his
chimera
a
desire
already
twelve
years
old
the
desire
of
a
priest
a
desire
formed
anew
every
evening
and
now
apparently
very
near
accomplishment
in
short
he
had
wrapped
himself
so
completely
in
the
fur
cape
of
a
canon
that
he
did
not
feel
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
during
the
evening
several
of
the
company
who
habitually
gathered
at
madame
de
listomere
s
had
almost
guaranteed
to
him
his
nomination
to
the
office
of
canon
then
vacant
in
the
metropolitan
chapter
of
assuring
him
that
no
one
deserved
such
promotion
as
he
whose
rights
long
overlooked
were
indisputable
if
he
had
lost
the
rubber
if
he
had
heard
that
his
rival
the
abbe
poirel
was
named
canon
the
worthy
man
would
have
thought
the
rain
extremely
chilling
he
might
even
have
thought
ill
of
life
but
it
so
chanced
that
he
was
in
one
of
those
rare
moments
when
happy
inward
sensations
make
a
man
oblivious
of
discomfort
in
hastening
his
steps
he
obeyed
a
more
mechanical
impulse
and
truth
so
essential
in
a
history
of
manners
and
morals
compels
us
to
say
that
he
was
thinking
of
neither
rain
nor
gout
in
former
days
there
was
in
the
cloister
on
the
side
towards
the
grand
rue
a
cluster
of
houses
forming
a
close
and
belonging
to
the
cathedral
where
several
of
the
dignitaries
of
the
chapter
lived
after
the
confiscation
of
ecclesiastical
property
the
town
had
turned
the
passage
through
this
close
into
a
narrow
street
called
the
rue
de
la
psalette
by
which
pedestrians
passed
from
the
cloister
to
the
grand
rue
the
name
of
this
street
proves
clearly
enough
that
the
precentor
and
his
pupils
and
those
connected
with
the
choir
formerly
lived
there
the
other
side
the
left
side
of
the
street
is
occupied
by
a
single
house
the
walls
of
which
are
overshadowed
by
the
buttresses
of
which
have
their
base
in
the
narrow
little
garden
of
the
house
leaving
it
doubtful
whether
the
cathedral
was
built
before
or
after
this
venerable
dwelling
an
archaeologist
examining
the
arabesques
the
shape
of
the
windows
the
arch
of
the
door
the
whole
exterior
of
the
house
now
mellow
with
age
would
see
at
once
that
it
had
always
been
a
part
of
the
magnificent
edifice
with
which
it
is
blended
an
antiquary
had
there
been
one
at
tours
one
of
the
least
literary
towns
in
all
france
would
even
discover
where
the
narrow
street
enters
the
cloister
several
vestiges
of
an
old
arcade
which
formerly
made
a
portico
to
these
ecclesiastical
dwellings
and
was
no
doubt
harmonious
in
style
with
the
general
character
of
the
architecture
the
house
of
which
we
speak
standing
on
the
north
side
of
the
cathedral
was
always
in
the
shadow
thrown
by
that
vast
edifice
on
which
time
had
cast
its
dingy
mantle
marked
its
furrows
and
shed
its
chill
humidity
its
lichen
mosses
and
rank
herbs
the
darkened
dwelling
was
wrapped
in
silence
broken
only
by
the
bells
by
the
chanting
of
the
offices
heard
through
the
windows
of
the
church
by
the
call
of
the
jackdaws
nesting
in
the
belfries
the
region
is
a
desert
of
stones
a
solitude
with
a
character
of
its
own
an
arid
spot
which
could
only
be
inhabited
by
beings
who
had
either
attained
to
absolute
nullity
or
were
gifted
with
some
abnormal
strength
of
soul
the
house
in
question
had
always
been
occupied
by
abbes
and
it
belonged
to
an
old
maid
named
mademoiselle
gamard
though
the
property
had
been
bought
from
the
national
domain
under
the
reign
of
terror
by
the
father
of
mademoiselle
gamard
no
one
objected
under
the
restoration
to
the
old
maid
s
retaining
it
because
she
took
priests
to
board
and
was
very
devout
it
may
be
that
religious
persons
gave
her
credit
for
the
intention
of
leaving
the
property
to
the
chapter
the
abbe
birotteau
was
making
his
way
to
this
house
where
he
had
lived
for
the
last
two
years
his
apartment
had
been
as
was
now
the
canonry
an
object
of
envy
and
his
hoc
erat
in
votis
for
a
dozen
years
to
be
mademoiselle
gamard
s
boarder
and
to
become
a
canon
were
the
two
great
desires
of
his
life
in
fact
they
do
present
accurately
the
ambition
of
a
priest
who
considering
himself
on
the
highroad
to
eternity
can
wish
for
nothing
in
this
world
but
good
lodging
good
food
clean
garments
shoes
with
silver
buckles
a
sufficiency
of
things
for
the
needs
of
the
animal
and
a
canonry
to
satisfy
that
inexpressible
sentiment
which
follows
us
they
say
into
the
presence
of
god
for
there
are
grades
among
the
saints
but
the
covetous
desire
for
the
apartment
which
the
abbe
birotteau
was
now
inhabiting
a
very
harmless
desire
in
the
eyes
of
worldly
people
had
been
to
the
abbe
nothing
less
than
a
passion
a
passion
full
of
obstacles
and
like
more
guilty
passions
full
of
hopes
pleasures
and
remorse
the
interior
arrangements
of
the
house
did
not
allow
mademoiselle
gamard
to
take
more
than
two
lodgers
now
for
about
twelve
years
before
the
day
when
birotteau
went
to
live
with
her
she
had
undertaken
to
keep
in
health
and
contentment
two
priests
namely
monsieur
l
abbe
troubert
and
monsieur
l
abbe
chapeloud
the
abbe
troubert
still
lived
the
abbe
chapeloud
was
dead
and
birotteau
had
stepped
into
his
place
the
late
abbe
chapeloud
in
life
a
canon
of
had
been
an
intimate
friend
of
the
abbe
birotteau
every
time
that
the
latter
paid
a
visit
to
the
canon
he
had
constantly
admired
the
apartment
the
furniture
and
the
library
out
of
this
admiration
grew
the
desire
to
possess
these
beautiful
things
it
had
been
impossible
for
the
abbe
birotteau
to
stifle
this
desire
though
it
often
made
him
suffer
terribly
when
he
reflected
that
the
death
of
his
best
friend
could
alone
satisfy
his
secret
covetousness
which
increased
as
time
went
on
the
abbe
chapeloud
and
his
friend
birotteau
were
not
rich
both
were
sons
of
peasants
and
their
slender
savings
had
been
spent
in
the
mere
costs
of
living
during
the
disastrous
years
of
the
revolution
when
napoleon
restored
the
catholic
worship
the
abbe
chapeloud
was
appointed
canon
of
the
cathedral
and
birotteau
was
made
vicar
of
it
chapeloud
then
went
to
board
with
mademoiselle
gamard
when
birotteau
first
came
to
visit
his
friend
he
thought
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
excellent
but
he
noticed
nothing
more
the
outset
of
this
concupiscence
of
chattels
was
very
like
that
of
a
true
passion
which
often
begins
in
a
young
man
with
cold
admiration
for
a
woman
whom
he
ends
in
loving
forever
the
apartment
reached
by
a
stone
staircase
was
on
the
side
of
the
house
that
faced
south
the
abbe
troubert
occupied
the
and
mademoiselle
gamard
the
first
floor
of
the
main
building
looking
on
the
street
when
chapeloud
took
possession
of
his
rooms
they
were
bare
of
furniture
and
the
ceilings
were
blackened
with
smoke
the
stone
mantelpieces
which
were
very
badly
cut
had
never
been
painted
at
first
the
only
furniture
the
poor
canon
could
put
in
was
a
bed
a
table
a
few
chairs
and
the
books
he
possessed
the
apartment
was
like
a
beautiful
woman
in
rags
but
two
or
three
years
later
an
old
lady
having
left
the
abbe
chapeloud
two
thousand
francs
he
spent
that
sum
on
the
purchase
of
an
oak
bookcase
the
relic
of
a
chateau
pulled
down
by
the
bande
noire
the
carving
of
which
deserved
the
admiration
of
all
artists
the
abbe
made
the
purchase
less
because
it
was
very
cheap
than
because
the
dimensions
of
the
bookcase
exactly
fitted
the
space
it
was
to
fill
in
his
gallery
his
savings
enabled
him
to
renovate
the
whole
gallery
which
up
to
this
time
had
been
neglected
and
shabby
the
floor
was
carefully
waxed
the
ceiling
whitened
the
painted
to
resemble
the
grain
and
knots
of
oak
a
long
table
in
ebony
and
two
cabinets
by
boulle
completed
the
decoration
and
gave
to
this
gallery
a
certain
air
that
was
full
of
character
in
the
course
of
two
years
the
liberality
of
devout
persons
and
legacies
though
small
ones
from
pious
penitents
filled
the
shelves
of
the
bookcase
till
then
half
empty
moreover
chapeloud
s
uncle
an
old
oratorian
had
left
him
his
collection
in
folio
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
and
several
other
important
works
that
were
precious
to
a
priest
birotteau
more
and
more
surprised
by
the
successive
improvements
of
the
gallery
once
so
bare
came
by
degrees
to
a
condition
of
involuntary
envy
he
wished
he
could
possess
that
apartment
so
thoroughly
in
keeping
with
the
gravity
of
ecclestiastical
life
the
passion
increased
from
day
to
day
working
sometimes
for
days
together
in
this
retreat
the
vicar
could
appreciate
the
silence
and
the
peace
that
reigned
there
during
the
following
year
the
abbe
chapeloud
turned
a
small
room
into
an
oratory
which
his
pious
friends
took
pleasure
in
beautifying
still
later
another
lady
gave
the
canon
a
set
of
furniture
for
his
bedroom
the
covering
of
which
she
had
embroidered
under
the
eyes
of
the
worthy
man
without
his
ever
suspecting
its
destination
the
bedroom
then
had
the
same
effect
upon
the
vicar
that
the
gallery
had
long
had
it
dazzled
him
lastly
about
three
years
before
the
abbe
chapeloud
s
death
he
completed
the
comfort
of
his
apartment
by
decorating
the
salon
though
the
furniture
was
plainly
covered
in
red
utrecht
velvet
it
fascinated
birotteau
from
the
day
when
the
canon
s
friend
first
laid
eyes
on
the
red
damask
curtains
the
mahogany
furniture
the
aubusson
carpet
which
adorned
the
vast
room
then
lately
painted
his
envy
of
chapeloud
s
apartment
became
a
monomania
hidden
within
his
breast
to
live
there
to
sleep
in
that
bed
with
the
silk
curtains
where
the
canon
slept
to
have
all
chapeloud
s
comforts
about
him
would
be
birotteau
felt
complete
happiness
he
saw
nothing
beyond
it
all
the
envy
all
the
ambition
which
the
things
of
this
world
give
birth
to
in
the
hearts
of
other
men
concentrated
themselves
for
birotteau
in
the
deep
and
secret
longing
he
felt
for
an
apartment
like
that
which
the
abbe
chapeloud
had
created
for
himself
when
his
friend
fell
ill
he
went
to
him
out
of
true
affection
but
all
the
same
when
he
first
heard
of
his
illness
and
when
he
sat
by
his
bed
to
keep
him
company
there
arose
in
the
depths
of
his
consciousness
in
spite
of
himself
a
crowd
of
thoughts
the
simple
formula
of
which
was
always
if
chapeloud
dies
i
can
have
this
and
yet
birotteau
having
an
excellent
heart
contracted
ideas
and
a
limited
mind
he
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
think
of
means
by
which
to
make
his
friend
bequeath
to
him
the
library
and
the
furniture
the
abbe
chapeloud
an
amiable
indulgent
egoist
fathomed
his
friend
s
desires
not
a
difficult
thing
to
do
and
forgave
them
which
may
seem
less
easy
to
a
priest
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
vicar
whose
friendship
was
faithful
did
not
fail
to
take
a
daily
walk
with
his
friend
along
their
usual
path
in
the
mail
de
tours
never
once
depriving
him
of
an
instant
of
the
time
devoted
for
over
twenty
years
to
that
exercise
birotteau
who
regarded
his
secret
wishes
as
crimes
would
have
been
capable
out
of
contrition
of
the
utmost
devotion
to
his
friend
the
latter
paid
his
debt
of
gratitude
for
a
friendship
so
ingenuously
sincere
by
saying
a
few
days
before
his
death
as
the
vicar
sat
by
him
reading
the
quotidienne
aloud
this
time
you
will
certainly
get
the
apartment
i
feel
it
is
all
over
with
me
accordingly
it
was
found
that
the
abbe
chapeloud
had
left
his
library
and
all
his
furniture
to
his
friend
birotteau
the
possession
of
these
things
so
keenly
desired
and
the
prospect
of
being
taken
to
board
by
mademoiselle
gamard
certainly
did
allay
the
grief
which
birotteau
felt
at
the
death
of
his
friend
the
canon
he
might
not
have
been
willing
to
resuscitate
him
but
he
mourned
him
for
several
days
he
was
like
gargantus
who
when
his
wife
died
in
giving
birth
to
pantagruel
did
not
know
whether
to
rejoice
at
the
birth
of
a
son
or
grieve
at
having
buried
his
good
babette
and
therefore
cheated
himself
by
rejoicing
at
the
death
of
his
wife
and
deploring
the
advent
of
pantagruel
the
abbe
birotteau
spent
the
first
days
of
his
mourning
in
verifying
the
books
in
library
in
making
use
of
furniture
in
examining
the
whole
of
his
inheritance
saying
in
a
tone
which
unfortunately
was
not
noted
at
the
time
poor
chapeloud
his
joy
and
his
grief
so
completely
absorbed
him
that
he
felt
no
pain
when
he
found
that
the
office
of
canon
in
which
the
late
chapeloud
had
hoped
his
friend
birotteau
might
succeed
him
was
given
to
another
mademoiselle
gamard
having
cheerfully
agreed
to
take
the
vicar
to
board
the
latter
was
thenceforth
a
participator
in
all
those
felicities
of
material
comfort
of
which
the
deceased
canon
had
been
wont
to
boast
incalculable
they
were
according
to
the
abbe
chapeloud
none
of
the
priests
who
inhabited
the
city
of
tours
not
even
the
archbishop
had
ever
been
the
object
of
such
minute
and
delicate
attentions
as
those
bestowed
by
mademoiselle
gamard
on
her
two
lodgers
the
first
words
the
canon
said
to
his
friend
when
they
met
for
their
walk
on
the
mail
referred
usually
to
the
succulent
dinner
he
had
just
eaten
and
it
was
a
very
rare
thing
if
during
the
walks
of
each
week
he
did
not
say
at
least
fourteen
times
that
excellent
spinster
certainly
has
a
vocation
for
serving
just
think
the
canon
would
say
to
birotteau
that
for
twelve
consecutive
years
nothing
has
ever
been
amiss

everything
in
its
place

in

and

so
bright
that
i
don

did
you

mademoiselle

keeps
an
incessant
watch
over
my
wants
i
can
t
remember
having
rung
twice
for
anything
no
matter
what
in
ten
years
that

what

call

i
never
have
to

not
even
my

always
a
good
fire
always
a
good
dinner
once
the
bellows
annoyed
me
the
nozzle
was
choked
up
but
i
only
mentioned
it
once
and
the
next
day
mademoiselle
gave
me
a
very
pretty
pair
also
those
nice
tongs
you
see
me
mend
the
fire
for
all
answer
birotteau
would
say
smelling
of
that
smelling
of
always
affected
him
the
canon
s
remarks
revealed
ideal
joys
to
the
poor
vicar
whose
bands
and
albs
were
the
plague
of
his
life
for
he
was
totally
devoid
of
method
and
often
forgot
to
order
his
dinner
therefore
if
he
saw
mademoiselle
gamard
at
while
saying
mass
or
taking
round
the
plate
he
never
failed
to
give
her
a
kindly
and
benevolent
look
such
a
look
as
saint
teresa
might
have
cast
to
heaven
though
the
comforts
which
all
creatures
desire
and
for
which
he
had
so
often
longed
thus
fell
to
his
share
the
abbe
birotteau
like
the
rest
of
the
world
found
it
difficult
even
for
a
priest
to
live
without
something
to
hanker
for
consequently
for
the
last
eighteen
months
he
had
replaced
his
two
satisfied
passions
by
an
ardent
longing
for
a
canonry
the
title
of
canon
had
become
to
him
very
much
what
a
peerage
is
to
a
plebeian
minister
the
prospect
of
an
appointment
hopes
of
which
had
just
been
held
out
to
him
at
madame
de
listomere
s
so
completely
turned
his
head
that
he
did
not
observe
until
he
reached
his
own
door
that
he
had
left
his
umbrella
behind
him
perhaps
even
then
if
the
rain
were
not
falling
in
torrents
he
might
not
have
missed
it
so
absorbed
was
he
in
the
pleasure
of
going
over
and
over
in
his
mind
what
had
been
said
to
him
on
the
subject
of
his
promotion
by
the
company
at
madame
de
listomere
s
an
old
lady
with
whom
he
spent
every
wednesday
evening
the
vicar
rang
loudly
as
if
to
let
the
servant
know
she
was
not
to
keep
him
waiting
then
he
stood
close
to
the
door
to
avoid
if
he
could
getting
showered
but
the
drip
from
the
roof
fell
precisely
on
the
toes
of
his
shoes
and
the
wind
blew
gusts
of
rain
into
his
face
that
were
much
like
a
having
calculated
the
time
necessary
for
the
woman
to
leave
the
kitchen
and
pull
the
string
of
the
outer
door
he
rang
again
this
time
in
a
manner
that
resulted
in
a
very
significant
peal
of
the
bell
they
can
t
be
out
he
said
to
himself
not
hearing
any
movement
on
the
premises
again
he
rang
producing
a
sound
that
echoed
sharply
through
the
house
and
was
taken
up
and
repeated
by
all
the
echoes
of
the
cathedral
so
that
no
one
could
avoid
waking
up
at
the
remonstrating
racket
accordingly
in
a
few
moments
he
heard
not
without
some
pleasure
in
his
wrath
the
wooden
shoes
of
the
clacking
along
the
paved
path
which
led
to
the
outer
door
but
even
then
the
discomforts
of
the
gouty
old
gentleman
were
not
so
quickly
over
as
he
hoped
instead
of
pulling
the
string
marianne
was
obliged
to
turn
the
lock
of
the
door
with
its
heavy
key
and
pull
back
all
the
bolts
why
did
you
let
me
ring
three
times
in
such
weather
said
the
vicar
but
monsieur
don
t
you
see
the
door
was
locked
we
have
all
been
in
bed
ever
so
long
it
struck
a
quarter
to
eleven
some
time
ago
mademoiselle
must
have
thought
you
were
you
saw
me
go
out
yourself
besides
mademoiselle
knows
very
well
i
always
go
to
madame
de
listomere
s
on
wednesday
i
only
did
as
mademoiselle
told
me
these
words
struck
the
vicar
a
blow
which
he
felt
the
more
because
his
late
revery
had
made
him
completely
happy
he
said
nothing
and
followed
marianne
towards
the
kitchen
to
get
his
candlestick
which
he
supposed
had
been
left
there
as
usual
but
instead
of
entering
the
kitchen
marianne
went
on
to
his
own
apartments
and
there
the
vicar
beheld
his
candlestick
on
a
table
close
to
the
door
of
the
red
salon
in
a
sort
of
antechamber
formed
by
the
landing
of
the
staircase
which
the
late
canon
had
inclosed
with
a
glass
partition
mute
with
amazement
he
entered
his
bedroom
hastily
found
no
fire
and
called
to
marianne
who
had
not
had
time
to
get
downstairs
you
have
not
lighted
the
fire
he
said
beg
pardon
monsieur
l
abbe
i
did
she
said
it
must
have
gone
birotteau
looked
again
at
the
hearth
and
felt
convinced
that
the
fire
had
been
out
since
morning
i
must
dry
my
feet
he
said
make
the
marianne
obeyed
with
the
haste
of
a
person
who
wants
to
get
back
to
her
night
s
rest
while
looking
about
him
for
his
slippers
which
were
not
in
the
middle
of
his
bedside
carpet
as
usual
the
abbe
took
mental
notes
of
the
state
of
marianne
s
dress
which
convinced
him
that
she
had
not
got
out
of
bed
to
open
the
door
as
she
said
she
had
he
then
recollected
that
for
the
last
two
weeks
he
had
been
deprived
of
various
little
attentions
which
for
eighteen
months
had
made
life
sweet
to
him
now
as
the
nature
of
narrow
minds
induces
them
to
study
trifles
birotteau
plunged
suddenly
into
deep
meditation
on
these
four
circumstances
imperceptible
in
their
meaning
to
others
but
to
him
indicative
of
four
catastrophes
the
total
loss
of
his
happiness
was
evidently
foreshadowed
in
the
neglect
to
place
his
slippers
in
marianne
s
falsehood
about
the
fire
in
the
unusual
removal
of
his
candlestick
to
the
table
of
the
antechamber
and
in
the
evident
intention
to
keep
him
waiting
in
the
rain
when
the
fire
was
burning
on
the
hearth
and
the
lamp
was
lighted
and
marianne
had
departed
without
saying
as
usual
does
monsieur
want
anything
more
the
abbe
birotteau
let
himself
fall
gently
into
the
wide
and
handsome
of
his
late
friend
but
there
was
something
mournful
in
the
movement
with
which
he
dropped
upon
it
the
good
soul
was
crushed
by
a
presentiment
of
coming
calamity
his
eyes
roved
successively
to
the
handsome
tall
clock
the
bureau
curtains
chairs
carpets
to
the
stately
bed
the
basin
of
the
crucifix
to
a
virgin
by
valentin
a
christ
by
lebrun
in
short
to
all
the
accessories
of
this
cherished
room
while
his
face
expressed
the
anguish
of
the
tenderest
farewell
that
a
lover
ever
took
of
his
first
mistress
or
an
old
man
of
his
lately
planted
trees
the
vicar
had
just
perceived
somewhat
late
it
is
true
the
signs
of
a
dumb
persecution
instituted
against
him
for
the
last
three
months
by
mademoiselle
gamard
whose
evil
intentions
would
doubtless
have
been
fathomed
much
sooner
by
a
more
intelligent
man
old
maids
have
a
special
talent
for
accentuating
the
words
and
actions
which
their
dislikes
suggest
to
them
they
scratch
like
cats
they
not
only
wound
but
they
take
pleasure
in
wounding
and
in
making
their
victim
see
that
he
is
wounded
a
man
of
the
world
would
never
have
allowed
himself
to
be
scratched
twice
the
good
abbe
on
the
contrary
had
taken
several
blows
from
those
sharp
claws
before
he
could
be
brought
to
believe
in
any
evil
intention
but
when
he
did
perceive
it
he
set
to
work
with
the
inquisitorial
sagacity
which
priests
acquire
by
directing
consciences
and
burrowing
into
the
nothings
of
the
confessional
to
establish
as
though
it
were
a
matter
of
religious
controversy
the
following
proposition
admitting
that
mademoiselle
gamard
did
not
remember
it
was
madame
de
listomere
s
evening
and
that
marianne
did
think
i
was
home
and
did
really
forget
to
make
my
fire
it
is
impossible
inasmuch
as
i
myself
took
down
my
candlestick
this
morning
that
mademoiselle
gamard
seeing
it
in
her
salon
could
have
supposed
i
had
gone
to
bed
ergo
mademoiselle
gamard
intended
that
i
should
stand
out
in
the
rain
and
by
carrying
my
candlestick
upstairs
she
meant
to
make
me
understand
it
what
does
it
all
mean
he
said
aloud
roused
by
the
gravity
of
these
circumstances
and
rising
as
he
spoke
to
take
off
his
damp
clothes
get
into
his
and
do
up
his
head
for
the
night
then
he
returned
from
the
bed
to
the
fireplace
gesticulating
and
launching
forth
in
various
tones
the
following
sentences
all
of
which
ended
in
a
high
falsetto
key
like
notes
of
interjection
what
the
deuce
have
i
done
to
her
why
is
she
angry
with
me
marianne
did
forget
my
fire
mademoiselle
told
her
not
to
light
it
i
must
be
a
child
if
i
can
t
see
from
the
tone
and
manner
she
has
been
taking
to
me
that
i
ve
done
something
to
displease
her
nothing
like
it
ever
happened
to
chapeloud
i
can
t
live
in
the
midst
of
such
torments
as
at
my
age
he
went
to
bed
hoping
that
the
morrow
might
enlighten
him
on
the
causes
of
the
dislike
which
threatened
to
destroy
forever
the
happiness
he
had
now
enjoyed
two
years
after
wishing
for
it
so
long
alas
the
secret
reasons
for
the
inimical
feelings
mademoiselle
gamard
bore
to
the
luckless
abbe
were
fated
to
remain
eternally
unknown
to
him
not
that
they
were
difficult
to
fathom
but
simply
because
he
lacked
the
good
faith
and
candor
by
which
great
souls
and
scoundrels
look
within
and
judge
themselves
a
man
of
genius
or
a
trickster
says
to
himself
i
did
and
native
talent
are
the
only
infallible
and
lucid
guides
now
the
abbe
birotteau
whose
goodness
amounted
to
stupidity
whose
knowledge
was
only
as
it
were
plastered
on
him
by
dint
of
study
who
had
no
experience
whatever
of
the
world
and
its
ways
who
lived
between
the
mass
and
the
confessional
chiefly
occupied
in
dealing
the
most
trivial
matters
of
conscience
in
his
capacity
of
confessor
to
all
the
schools
in
town
and
to
a
few
noble
souls
who
rightly
appreciated
him
the
abbe
birotteau
must
be
regarded
as
a
great
child
to
whom
most
of
the
practices
of
social
life
were
utterly
unknown
and
yet
the
natural
selfishness
of
all
human
beings
reinforced
by
the
selfishness
peculiar
to
the
priesthood
and
that
of
the
narrow
life
of
the
provinces
had
insensibly
and
unknown
to
himself
developed
within
him
if
any
one
had
felt
enough
interest
in
the
good
man
to
probe
his
spirit
and
prove
to
him
that
in
the
numerous
petty
details
of
his
life
and
in
the
minute
duties
of
his
daily
existence
he
was
essentially
lacking
in
the
he
professed
he
would
have
punished
and
mortified
himself
in
good
faith
but
those
whom
we
offend
by
such
unconscious
selfishness
pay
little
heed
to
our
real
innocence
what
they
want
is
vengeance
and
they
take
it
thus
it
happened
that
birotteau
weak
brother
that
he
was
was
made
to
undergo
the
decrees
of
that
great
distributive
justice
which
goes
about
compelling
the
world
to
execute
its
judgments
called
by
ninnies
the
misfortunes
of
there
was
this
difference
between
the
late
chapeloud
and
the
vicar
one
was
a
shrewd
and
clever
egoist
the
other
a
and
clumsy
one
when
the
canon
went
to
board
with
mademoiselle
gamard
he
knew
exactly
how
to
judge
of
his
landlady
s
character
the
confessional
had
taught
him
to
understand
the
bitterness
that
the
sense
of
being
kept
outside
the
social
pale
puts
into
the
heart
of
an
old
maid
he
therefore
calculated
his
own
treatment
of
mademoiselle
gamard
very
wisely
she
was
then
about
years
old
and
still
retained
a
few
pretensions
which
in
persons
of
her
condition
change
rather
later
into
strong
personal
the
canon
saw
plainly
that
to
live
comfortably
with
his
landlady
he
must
pay
her
invariably
the
same
attentions
and
be
more
infallible
than
the
pope
himself
to
compass
this
result
he
allowed
no
points
of
contact
between
himself
and
her
except
those
that
politeness
demanded
and
those
which
necessarily
exist
between
two
persons
living
under
the
same
roof
thus
though
he
and
the
abbe
troubert
took
their
regular
three
meals
a
day
he
avoided
the
family
breakfast
by
inducing
mademoiselle
gamard
to
send
his
coffee
to
his
own
room
he
also
avoided
the
annoyance
of
supper
by
taking
tea
in
the
houses
of
friends
with
whom
he
spent
his
evenings
in
this
way
he
seldom
saw
his
landlady
except
at
dinner
but
he
always
came
down
to
that
meal
a
few
minutes
in
advance
of
the
hour
during
this
visit
of
courtesy
as
it
may
be
called
he
talked
to
her
for
the
twelve
years
he
had
lived
under
her
roof
on
nearly
the
same
topics
receiving
from
her
the
same
answers
how
she
had
slept
her
breakfast
the
trivial
domestic
events
her
looks
her
health
the
weather
the
time
the
church
services
had
lasted
the
incidents
of
the
mass
the
health
of
such
or
such
a
priest
these
were
the
subjects
of
their
daily
conversation
during
dinner
he
invariably
paid
her
certain
indirect
compliments
the
fish
had
an
excellent
flavor
the
seasoning
of
a
sauce
was
delicious
mademoiselle
gamard
s
capacities
and
virtues
as
mistress
of
a
household
were
great
he
was
sure
of
flattering
the
old
maid
s
vanity
by
praising
the
skill
with
which
she
made
or
prepared
her
preserves
and
pickles
and
pates
and
other
gastronomical
inventions
to
cap
all
the
wily
canon
never
left
his
landlady
s
yellow
salon
after
dinner
without
remarking
that
there
was
no
house
in
tours
where
he
could
get
such
good
coffee
as
that
he
had
just
imbibed
thanks
to
this
thorough
understanding
of
mademoiselle
gamard
s
character
and
to
the
science
of
existence
which
he
had
put
in
practice
for
the
last
twelve
years
no
matter
of
discussion
on
the
internal
arrangements
of
the
household
had
ever
come
up
between
them
the
abbe
chapeloud
had
taken
note
of
the
spinster
s
angles
asperities
and
crabbedness
and
had
so
arranged
his
avoidance
of
her
that
he
obtained
without
the
least
difficulty
all
the
concessions
that
were
necessary
to
the
happiness
and
tranquility
of
his
life
the
result
was
that
mademoiselle
gamard
frequently
remarked
to
her
friends
and
acquaintances
that
the
abbe
chapeloud
was
a
very
amiable
man
extremely
easy
to
live
with
and
a
fine
mind
as
to
her
other
lodger
the
abbe
troubert
she
said
absolutely
nothing
about
him
completely
involved
in
the
round
of
her
life
like
a
satellite
in
the
orbit
of
a
planet
troubert
was
to
her
a
sort
of
intermediary
creature
between
the
individuals
of
the
human
species
and
those
of
the
canine
species
he
was
classed
in
her
heart
next
but
directly
before
the
place
intended
for
friends
but
now
occupied
by
a
fat
and
wheezy
pug
which
she
tenderly
loved
she
ruled
troubert
completely
and
the
intermingling
of
their
interests
was
so
obvious
that
many
persons
of
her
social
sphere
believed
that
the
abbe
troubert
had
designs
on
the
old
maid
s
property
and
was
binding
her
to
him
unawares
with
infinite
patience
and
really
directing
her
while
he
seemed
to
be
obeying
without
ever
letting
her
perceive
in
him
the
slightest
wish
on
his
part
to
govern
her
when
the
abbe
chapeloud
died
the
old
maid
who
desired
a
lodger
with
quiet
ways
naturally
thought
of
the
vicar
before
the
canon
s
will
was
made
known
she
had
meditated
offering
his
rooms
to
the
abbe
troubert
who
was
not
very
comfortable
on
the
but
when
the
abbe
birotteau
on
receiving
his
legacy
came
to
settle
in
writing
the
terms
of
his
board
she
saw
he
was
so
in
love
with
the
apartment
for
which
he
might
now
admit
his
long
cherished
desires
that
she
dared
not
propose
the
exchange
and
accordingly
sacrificed
her
sentiments
of
friendship
to
the
demands
of
but
in
order
to
console
her
beloved
canon
mademoiselle
took
up
the
large
white
bricks
that
made
the
floors
of
his
apartment
and
replaced
them
by
wooden
floors
laid
in
point
de
she
also
rebuilt
a
smoky
chimney
for
twelve
years
the
abbe
birotteau
had
seen
his
friend
chapeloud
in
that
house
without
ever
giving
a
thought
to
the
motive
of
the
canon
s
extreme
circumspection
in
his
relations
to
mademoiselle
gamard
when
he
came
himself
to
live
with
that
saintly
woman
he
was
in
the
condition
of
a
lover
on
the
point
of
being
made
happy
even
if
he
had
not
been
by
nature
purblind
of
intellect
his
eyes
were
too
dazzled
by
his
new
happiness
to
allow
him
to
judge
of
the
landlady
or
to
reflect
on
the
limits
which
he
ought
to
impose
on
their
daily
intercourse
mademoiselle
gamard
seen
from
afar
and
through
the
prism
of
those
material
felicities
which
the
vicar
dreamed
of
enjoying
in
her
house
seemed
to
him
a
perfect
being
a
faultless
christian
essentially
charitable
the
woman
of
the
gospel
the
wise
virgin
adorned
by
all
those
humble
and
modest
virtues
which
shed
celestial
fragrance
upon
life
so
with
the
enthusiasm
of
one
who
attains
an
object
long
desired
with
the
candor
of
a
child
and
the
blundering
foolishness
of
an
old
man
utterly
without
worldly
experience
he
fell
into
the
life
of
mademoiselle
gamard
precisely
as
a
fly
is
caught
in
a
spider
s
web
the
first
day
that
he
went
to
dine
and
sleep
at
the
house
he
was
detained
in
the
salon
after
dinner
partly
to
make
his
landlady
s
acquaintance
but
chiefly
by
that
inexplicable
embarrassment
which
often
assails
timid
people
and
makes
them
fear
to
seem
impolite
by
breaking
off
a
conversation
in
order
to
take
leave
consequently
he
remained
there
the
whole
evening
then
a
friend
of
his
a
certain
mademoiselle
salomon
de
villenoix
came
to
see
him
and
this
gave
mademoiselle
gamard
the
happiness
of
forming
a
so
that
when
the
vicar
went
to
bed
he
felt
that
he
had
passed
a
very
agreeable
evening
knowing
mademoiselle
gamard
and
the
abbe
troubert
but
slightly
he
saw
only
the
superficial
aspects
of
their
characters
few
persons
bare
their
defects
at
once
they
generally
take
on
a
becoming
veneer
the
worthy
abbe
was
thus
led
to
suggest
to
himself
the
charming
plan
of
devoting
all
his
evenings
to
mademoiselle
gamard
instead
of
spending
them
as
chapeloud
had
done
elsewhere
the
old
maid
had
for
years
been
possessed
by
a
desire
which
grew
stronger
day
by
day
this
desire
often
formed
by
old
persons
and
even
by
pretty
women
had
become
in
mademoiselle
gamard
s
soul
as
ardent
a
longing
as
that
of
birotteau
for
chapeloud
s
apartment
and
it
was
strengthened
by
all
those
feelings
of
pride
egotism
envy
and
vanity
which
in
the
breasts
of
worldly
people
this
history
is
of
all
time
it
suffices
to
widen
slightly
the
narrow
circle
in
which
these
personages
are
about
to
act
to
find
the
coefficient
reasons
of
events
which
take
place
in
the
very
highest
spheres
of
social
life
mademoiselle
gamard
spent
her
evenings
by
rotation
in
six
or
eight
different
houses
whether
it
was
that
she
disliked
being
obliged
to
go
out
to
seek
society
and
considered
that
at
her
age
she
had
a
right
to
expect
some
return
or
that
her
pride
was
wounded
at
receiving
no
company
in
her
house
or
that
her
craved
the
compliments
she
saw
her
various
hostesses
receive
certain
it
is
that
her
whole
ambition
was
to
make
her
salon
a
centre
towards
which
a
given
number
of
persons
should
nightly
make
their
way
with
pleasure
one
morning
as
she
left
after
birotteau
and
his
friend
mademoiselle
salomon
had
spent
a
few
evenings
with
her
and
with
the
faithful
and
patient
troubert
she
said
to
certain
of
her
good
friends
whom
she
met
at
the
church
door
and
whose
slave
she
had
hitherto
considered
herself
that
those
who
wished
to
see
her
could
certainly
come
once
a
week
to
her
house
where
she
had
friends
enough
to
make
a
she
could
not
leave
the
abbe
birotteau
mademoiselle
salomon
had
not
missed
a
single
evening
that
week
she
was
devoted
to
friends
and
et
cetera
et
cetera
her
speech
was
all
the
more
humbly
haughty
and
softly
persuasive
because
mademoiselle
salomon
de
villenoix
belonged
to
the
most
aristocratic
society
in
tours
for
though
mademoiselle
salomon
came
to
mademoiselle
gamard
s
house
solely
out
of
friendship
for
the
vicar
the
old
maid
triumphed
in
receiving
her
and
saw
that
thanks
to
birotteau
she
was
on
the
point
of
succeeding
in
her
great
desire
to
form
a
circle
as
numerous
and
as
agreeable
as
those
of
madame
de
listomere
mademoiselle
merlin
de
la
blottiere
and
other
devout
ladies
who
were
in
the
habit
of
receiving
the
pious
and
ecclesiastical
society
of
tours
but
alas
the
abbe
birotteau
himself
caused
this
cherished
hope
to
miscarry
now
if
those
persons
who
in
the
course
of
their
lives
have
attained
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
long
desired
happiness
and
have
therefore
comprehended
the
joy
of
the
vicar
when
he
stepped
into
chapeloud
s
vacant
place
they
will
also
have
gained
some
faint
idea
of
mademoiselle
gamard
s
distress
at
the
overthrow
of
her
favorite
plan
after
accepting
his
happiness
in
the
old
maid
s
salon
for
six
months
with
tolerable
patience
birotteau
deserted
the
house
of
an
evening
carrying
with
him
mademoiselle
salomon
in
spite
of
her
utmost
efforts
the
ambitious
gamard
had
recruited
barely
six
visitors
whose
faithful
attendance
was
more
than
problematical
and
boston
could
not
be
played
night
after
night
unless
at
least
four
persons
were
present
the
defection
of
her
two
principal
guests
obliged
her
therefore
to
make
suitable
apologies
and
return
to
her
evening
visiting
among
former
friends
for
old
maids
find
their
own
company
so
distasteful
that
they
prefer
to
seek
the
doubtful
pleasures
of
society
the
cause
of
this
desertion
is
plain
enough
although
the
vicar
was
one
of
those
to
whom
heaven
is
hereafter
to
belong
in
virtue
of
the
decree
blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit
he
could
not
like
some
fools
endure
the
annoyance
that
other
fools
caused
him
persons
without
minds
are
like
weeds
that
delight
in
good
earth
they
want
to
be
amused
by
others
all
the
more
because
they
are
dull
within
the
incarnation
of
ennui
to
which
they
are
victims
joined
to
the
need
they
feel
of
getting
a
divorce
from
themselves
produces
that
passion
for
moving
about
for
being
somewhere
else
than
where
they
are
which
distinguishes
their
species
and
also
that
of
all
beings
devoid
of
sensitiveness
and
those
who
have
missed
their
destiny
or
who
suffer
by
their
own
fault
without
really
fathoming
the
vacuity
and
emptiness
of
mademoiselle
gamard
s
mind
or
stating
to
himself
the
pettiness
of
her
ideas
the
poor
abbe
perceived
unfortunately
too
late
the
defects
which
she
shared
with
all
old
maids
and
those
which
were
peculiar
to
herself
the
bad
points
of
others
show
out
so
strongly
against
the
good
that
they
usually
strike
our
eyes
before
they
wound
us
this
moral
phenomenon
might
at
a
pinch
be
made
to
excuse
the
tendency
we
all
have
more
or
less
to
gossip
it
is
so
natural
socially
speaking
to
laugh
at
the
failings
of
others
that
we
ought
to
forgive
the
ridicule
our
own
absurdities
excite
and
be
annoyed
only
by
calumny
but
in
this
instance
the
eyes
of
the
good
vicar
never
reached
the
optical
range
which
enables
men
of
the
world
to
see
and
evade
their
neighbours
rough
points
before
he
could
be
brought
to
perceive
the
faults
of
his
landlady
he
was
forced
to
undergo
the
warning
which
nature
gives
to
all
her
creatures
pain
old
maids
who
have
never
yielded
in
their
habits
of
life
or
in
their
characters
to
other
lives
and
other
characters
as
the
fate
of
woman
exacts
have
as
a
general
thing
a
mania
for
making
others
give
way
to
them
in
mademoiselle
gamard
this
sentiment
had
degenerated
into
despotism
but
a
despotism
that
could
only
exercise
itself
on
little
things
for
instance
among
a
hundred
other
examples
the
basket
of
counters
placed
on
the
for
the
abbe
birotteau
was
to
stand
exactly
where
she
placed
it
and
the
abbe
annoyed
her
terribly
by
moving
it
which
he
did
nearly
every
evening
how
is
this
sensitiveness
stupidly
spent
on
nothings
to
be
accounted
for
what
is
the
object
of
it
no
one
could
have
told
in
this
case
mademoiselle
gamard
herself
knew
no
reason
for
it
the
vicar
though
a
sheep
by
nature
did
not
like
any
more
than
other
sheep
to
feel
the
crook
too
often
especially
when
it
bristled
with
spikes
not
seeking
to
explain
to
himself
the
patience
of
the
abbe
troubert
birotteau
simply
withdrew
from
the
happiness
which
mademoiselle
gamard
believed
that
she
seasoned
to
his
liking
for
she
regarded
happiness
as
a
thing
to
be
made
like
her
preserves
but
the
luckless
abbe
made
the
break
in
a
clumsy
way
the
natural
way
of
his
own
naive
character
and
it
was
not
carried
out
without
much
nagging
and
which
the
abbe
birotteau
endeavored
to
bear
as
if
he
did
not
feel
them
by
the
end
of
the
first
year
of
his
sojourn
under
mademoiselle
gamard
s
roof
the
vicar
had
resumed
his
former
habits
spending
two
evenings
a
week
with
madame
de
listomere
three
with
mademoiselle
salomon
and
the
other
two
with
mademoiselle
merlin
de
la
blottiere
these
ladies
belonged
to
the
aristocratic
circles
of
tourainean
society
to
which
mademoiselle
gamard
was
not
admitted
therefore
the
abbe
s
abandonment
was
the
more
insulting
because
it
made
her
feel
her
want
of
social
value
all
choice
implies
contempt
for
the
thing
rejected
monsieur
birotteau
does
not
find
us
agreeable
enough
said
the
abbe
troubert
to
mademoiselle
gamard
s
friends
when
she
was
forced
to
tell
them
that
her
evenings
must
be
given
up
he
is
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
good
liver
he
wants
fashion
luxury
witty
conversation
and
the
scandals
of
the
these
words
of
course
obliged
mademoiselle
gamard
to
defend
herself
at
birotteau
s
expense
he
is
not
much
a
man
of
the
world
she
said
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
abbe
chapeloud
he
would
never
have
been
received
at
madame
de
listomere
s
oh
what
didn
t
i
lose
in
losing
the
abbe
chapeloud
such
an
amiable
man
and
so
easy
to
live
with
in
twelve
whole
years
i
never
had
the
slightest
difficulty
or
disagreement
with
presented
thus
the
innocent
abbe
was
considered
by
this
bourgeois
society
which
secretly
hated
the
aristocratic
society
as
a
man
essentially
exacting
and
hard
to
get
along
with
for
a
week
mademoiselle
gamard
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
being
pitied
by
friends
who
without
really
thinking
one
word
of
what
they
said
kept
repeating
to
her
how
he
have
turned
against
you
so
kind
and
gentle
as
you
are
or
console
yourself
dear
mademoiselle
gamard
you
are
so
well
known
that
et
cetera
nevertheless
these
friends
enchanted
to
escape
one
evening
a
week
in
the
cloister
the
darkest
dreariest
and
most
out
of
the
way
corner
in
tours
blessed
the
poor
vicar
in
their
hearts
between
persons
who
are
perpetually
in
each
other
s
company
dislike
or
love
increases
daily
every
moment
brings
reasons
to
love
or
hate
each
other
more
and
more
the
abbe
birotteau
soon
became
intolerable
to
mademoiselle
gamard
eighteen
months
after
she
had
taken
him
to
board
and
at
the
moment
when
the
worthy
man
was
mistaking
the
silence
of
hatred
for
the
peacefulness
of
content
and
applauding
himself
for
having
as
he
said
managed
matters
so
well
with
the
old
maid
he
was
really
the
object
of
an
underhand
persecution
and
a
vengeance
deliberately
planned
the
four
marked
circumstances
of
the
locked
door
the
forgotten
slippers
the
lack
of
fire
and
the
removal
of
the
candlestick
were
the
first
signs
that
revealed
to
him
a
terrible
enmity
the
final
consequences
of
which
were
destined
not
to
strike
him
until
the
time
came
when
they
were
irreparable
as
he
went
to
bed
the
worthy
vicar
worked
his
brains
quite
uselessly
for
he
was
soon
at
the
end
of
them
to
explain
to
himself
the
extraordinarily
discourteous
conduct
of
mademoiselle
gamard
the
fact
was
that
having
all
along
acted
logically
in
obeying
the
natural
laws
of
his
own
egotism
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
now
perceive
his
own
faults
towards
his
landlady
though
the
great
things
of
life
are
simple
to
understand
and
easy
to
express
the
littlenesses
require
a
vast
number
of
details
to
explain
them
the
foregoing
events
which
may
be
called
a
sort
of
prologue
to
this
bourgeois
drama
in
which
we
shall
find
passions
as
violent
as
those
excited
by
great
interests
required
this
long
introduction
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
any
faithful
historian
to
shorten
the
account
of
these
minute
developments
ii
the
next
morning
on
awaking
birotteau
thought
so
much
of
his
prospective
canonry
that
he
forgot
the
four
circumstances
in
which
he
had
seen
the
night
before
such
threatening
prognostics
of
a
future
full
of
misery
the
vicar
was
not
a
man
to
get
up
without
a
fire
he
rang
to
let
marianne
know
that
he
was
awake
and
that
she
must
come
to
him
then
he
remained
as
his
habit
was
absorbed
in
somnolent
musings
the
servant
s
custom
was
to
make
the
fire
and
gently
draw
him
from
his
half
sleep
by
the
murmured
sound
of
her
movements
a
sort
of
music
which
he
loved
twenty
minutes
passed
and
marianne
had
not
appeared
the
vicar
now
half
a
canon
was
about
to
ring
again
when
he
let
go
the
hearing
a
man
s
step
on
the
staircase
in
a
minute
more
the
abbe
troubert
after
discreetly
knocking
at
the
door
obeyed
birotteau
s
invitation
and
entered
the
room
this
visit
which
the
two
abbe
s
usually
paid
each
other
once
a
month
was
no
surprise
to
the
vicar
the
canon
at
once
exclaimed
when
he
saw
that
marianne
had
not
made
the
fire
of
his
he
opened
the
window
and
called
to
her
harshly
telling
her
to
come
at
once
to
the
abbe
then
turning
round
to
his
ecclesiastical
brother
he
said
if
mademoiselle
knew
that
you
had
no
fire
she
would
scold
after
this
speech
he
inquired
about
birotteau
s
health
and
asked
in
a
gentle
voice
if
he
had
had
any
recent
news
that
gave
him
hopes
of
his
canonry
the
vicar
explained
the
steps
he
had
taken
and
told
naively
the
names
of
the
persons
with
whom
madam
de
listomere
was
using
her
influence
quite
unaware
that
troubert
had
never
forgiven
that
lady
for
not
admitting
him
the
abbe
troubert
twice
proposed
by
the
bishop
as
to
her
house
it
would
be
impossible
to
find
two
figures
which
presented
so
many
contrasts
to
each
other
as
those
of
the
two
abbes
troubert
tall
and
lean
was
yellow
and
bilious
while
the
vicar
was
what
we
call
familiarly
plump
birotteau
s
face
round
and
ruddy
proclaimed
a
kindly
nature
barren
of
ideas
while
that
of
the
abbe
troubert
long
and
ploughed
by
many
wrinkles
took
on
at
times
an
expression
of
sarcasm
or
else
of
contempt
but
it
was
necessary
to
watch
him
very
closely
before
those
sentiments
could
be
detected
the
canon
s
habitual
condition
was
perfect
calmness
and
his
eyelids
were
usually
lowered
over
his
eyes
which
could
however
give
clear
and
piercing
glances
when
he
liked
reddish
hair
added
to
the
gloomy
effect
of
this
countenance
which
was
always
obscured
by
the
veil
which
deep
meditation
drew
across
its
features
many
persons
at
first
sight
thought
him
absorbed
in
high
and
earnest
ambitions
but
those
who
claimed
to
know
him
better
denied
that
impression
insisting
that
he
was
only
stupidly
dull
under
mademoiselle
gamard
s
despotism
or
else
worn
out
by
too
much
fasting
he
seldom
spoke
and
never
laughed
when
it
did
so
happen
that
he
felt
agreeably
moved
a
feeble
smile
would
flicker
on
his
lips
and
lose
itself
in
the
wrinkles
of
his
face
birotteau
on
the
other
hand
was
all
expansion
all
frankness
he
loved
good
things
and
was
amused
by
trifles
with
the
simplicity
of
a
man
who
knew
no
spite
or
malice
the
abbe
troubert
roused
at
first
sight
an
involuntary
feeling
of
fear
while
the
vicar
s
presence
brought
a
kindly
smile
to
the
lips
of
all
who
looked
at
him
when
the
tall
canon
marched
with
solemn
step
through
the
naves
and
cloisters
of
his
head
bowed
his
eye
stern
respect
followed
him
that
bent
face
was
in
harmony
with
the
yellowing
arches
of
the
cathedral
the
folds
of
his
cassock
fell
in
monumental
lines
that
were
worthy
of
statuary
the
good
vicar
on
the
contrary
perambulated
about
with
no
gravity
at
all
he
trotted
and
ambled
and
seemed
at
times
to
roll
himself
along
but
with
all
this
there
was
one
point
of
resemblance
between
the
two
men
for
precisely
as
troubert
s
ambitious
air
which
made
him
feared
had
contributed
probably
to
keep
him
down
to
the
insignificant
position
of
a
mere
canon
so
the
character
and
ways
of
birotteau
marked
him
out
as
perpetually
the
vicar
of
the
cathedral
and
nothing
higher
yet
the
abbe
troubert
now
fifty
years
of
age
had
entirely
removed
partly
by
the
circumspection
of
his
conduct
and
the
apparent
lack
of
all
ambitions
and
partly
by
his
saintly
life
the
fears
which
his
suspected
ability
and
his
powerful
presence
had
roused
in
the
minds
of
his
superiors
his
health
having
seriously
failed
him
during
the
last
year
it
seemed
probable
that
he
would
soon
be
raised
to
the
office
of
of
the
archbishopric
his
competitors
themselves
desired
the
appointment
so
that
their
own
plans
might
have
time
to
mature
during
the
few
remaining
days
which
a
malady
now
become
chronic
might
allow
him
far
from
offering
the
same
hopes
to
rivals
birotteau
s
triple
chin
showed
to
all
who
wanted
his
coveted
canonry
an
evidence
of
the
soundest
health
even
his
gout
seemed
to
them
in
accordance
with
the
proverb
an
assurance
of
longevity
the
abbe
chapeloud
a
man
of
great
good
sense
whose
amiability
had
made
the
leaders
of
the
diocese
and
the
members
of
the
best
society
in
tours
seek
his
company
had
steadily
opposed
though
secretly
and
with
much
judgment
the
elevation
of
the
abbe
troubert
he
had
even
adroitly
managed
to
prevent
his
access
to
the
salons
of
the
best
society
nevertheless
during
chapeloud
s
lifetime
troubert
treated
him
invariably
with
great
respect
and
showed
him
on
all
occasions
the
utmost
deference
this
constant
submission
did
not
however
change
the
opinion
of
the
late
canon
who
said
to
birotteau
during
the
last
walk
they
took
together
distrust
that
lean
stick
of
a
troubert
sixtus
the
fifth
reduced
to
the
limits
of
a
bishopric
such
was
the
friend
the
abiding
guest
of
mademoiselle
gamard
who
now
came
the
morning
after
the
old
maid
had
as
it
were
declared
war
against
the
poor
vicar
to
pay
his
brother
a
visit
and
show
him
marks
of
friendship
you
must
excuse
marianne
said
the
canon
as
the
woman
entered
i
suppose
she
went
first
to
my
rooms
they
are
very
damp
and
i
coughed
all
night
you
are
most
healthily
situated
here
he
added
looking
up
at
the
cornice
yes
i
am
lodged
like
a
canon
replied
birotteau
and
i
like
a
vicar
said
the
other
humbly
but
you
will
soon
be
settled
in
the
archbishop
s
palace
said
the
kindly
vicar
who
wanted
everybody
to
be
happy
yes
or
in
the
cemetery
but
god
s
will
be
done
and
troubert
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
resignedly
i
came
he
said
to
ask
you
to
lend
me
the
register
of
you
are
the
only
man
in
tours
i
know
who
has
a
take
it
out
of
my
library
replied
birotteau
reminded
by
the
canon
s
words
of
the
greatest
happiness
of
his
life
the
canon
passed
into
the
library
and
stayed
there
while
the
vicar
dressed
presently
the
breakfast
bell
rang
and
the
gouty
vicar
reflected
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
troubert
s
visit
he
would
have
had
no
fire
to
dress
by
he
s
a
kind
man
thought
he
the
two
priests
went
downstairs
together
each
armed
with
a
huge
folio
which
they
laid
on
one
of
the
side
tables
in
the
what
s
all
that
asked
mademoiselle
gamard
in
a
sharp
voice
addressing
birotteau
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
litter
up
my
with
your
old
books
they
are
books
i
wanted
replied
the
abbe
troubert
monsieur
birotteau
has
been
kind
enough
to
lend
them
to
i
might
have
guessed
it
she
said
with
a
contemptuous
smile
monsieur
birotteau
doesn
t
often
read
books
of
that
how
are
you
mademoiselle
said
the
vicar
in
a
mellifluous
voice
not
very
well
she
replied
shortly
you
woke
me
up
last
night
out
of
my
first
sleep
and
i
was
wakeful
for
the
rest
of
the
then
sitting
down
she
added
gentlemen
the
milk
is
getting
stupefied
at
being
so
received
by
his
landlady
from
whom
he
half
expected
an
apology
and
yet
alarmed
like
all
timid
people
at
the
prospect
of
a
discussion
especially
if
it
relates
to
themselves
the
poor
vicar
took
his
seat
in
silence
then
observing
in
mademoiselle
gamard
s
face
the
visible
signs
of
he
was
goaded
into
a
struggle
between
his
reason
which
told
him
that
he
ought
not
to
submit
to
such
discourtesy
from
a
landlady
and
his
natural
character
which
prompted
him
to
avoid
a
quarrel
torn
by
this
inward
misery
birotteau
fell
to
examining
attentively
the
broad
green
lines
painted
on
the
oilcloth
which
from
custom
immemorial
mademoiselle
gamard
left
on
the
table
at
without
regard
to
the
ragged
edges
or
the
various
scars
displayed
on
its
surface
the
priests
sat
opposite
to
each
other
in
on
either
side
of
the
square
table
the
head
of
which
was
taken
by
the
landlady
who
seemed
to
dominate
the
whole
from
a
high
chair
raised
on
casters
filled
with
cushions
and
standing
very
near
to
the
stove
this
room
and
the
salon
were
on
the
beneath
the
salon
and
bedroom
of
the
abbe
birotteau
when
the
vicar
had
received
his
cup
of
coffee
duly
sugared
from
mademoiselle
gamard
he
felt
chilled
to
the
bone
at
the
grim
silence
in
which
he
was
forced
to
proceed
with
the
usually
gay
function
of
breakfast
he
dared
not
look
at
troubert
s
features
nor
at
the
threatening
visage
of
the
old
maid
and
he
therefore
turned
to
keep
himself
in
countenance
to
the
plethoric
pug
which
was
lying
on
a
cushion
near
the
stove
a
position
that
victim
of
obesity
seldom
quitted
having
a
little
plate
of
dainties
always
at
his
left
side
and
a
bowl
of
fresh
water
at
his
right
well
my
pretty
said
the
vicar
are
you
waiting
for
your
coffee
the
personage
thus
addressed
one
of
the
most
important
in
the
household
though
the
least
troublesome
inasmuch
as
he
had
ceased
to
bark
and
left
the
talking
to
his
mistress
turned
his
little
eyes
sunk
in
rolls
of
fat
upon
birotteau
then
he
closed
them
peevishly
to
explain
the
misery
of
the
poor
vicar
it
should
be
said
that
being
endowed
by
nature
with
an
empty
and
sonorous
loquacity
like
the
resounding
of
a
football
he
was
in
the
habit
of
asserting
without
any
medical
reason
to
back
him
that
speech
favored
digestion
mademoiselle
gamard
who
believed
in
this
hygienic
doctrine
had
not
as
yet
refrained
in
spite
of
their
coolness
from
talking
at
meals
though
for
the
last
few
mornings
the
vicar
had
been
forced
to
strain
his
mind
to
find
beguiling
topics
on
which
to
loosen
her
tongue
if
the
narrow
limits
of
this
history
permitted
us
to
report
even
one
of
the
conversations
which
often
brought
a
bitter
and
sarcastic
smile
to
the
lips
of
the
abbe
troubert
it
would
offer
a
finished
picture
of
the
boeotian
life
of
the
provinces
the
singular
revelations
of
the
abbe
birotteau
and
mademoiselle
gamard
relating
to
their
personal
opinions
on
politics
religion
and
literature
would
delight
observing
minds
it
would
be
highly
entertaining
to
transcribe
the
reasons
on
which
they
mutually
doubted
the
death
of
napoleon
in
or
the
conjectures
by
which
they
mutually
believed
that
the
dauphin
was
living
rescued
from
the
temple
in
the
hollow
of
a
huge
log
of
wood
who
could
have
helped
laughing
to
hear
them
assert
and
prove
by
reasons
evidently
their
own
that
the
king
of
france
alone
imposed
the
taxes
that
the
chambers
were
convoked
to
destroy
the
clergy
that
thirteen
hundred
thousand
persons
had
perished
on
the
scaffold
during
the
revolution
they
frequently
discussed
the
press
without
either
of
them
having
the
faintest
idea
of
what
that
modern
engine
really
was
monsieur
birotteau
listened
with
acceptance
to
mademoiselle
gamard
when
she
told
him
that
a
man
who
ate
an
egg
every
morning
would
die
in
a
year
and
that
facts
proved
it
that
a
roll
of
light
bread
eaten
without
drinking
for
several
days
together
would
cure
sciatica
that
all
the
workmen
who
assisted
in
pulling
down
the
abbey
had
died
in
six
months
that
a
certain
prefect
under
orders
from
bonaparte
had
done
his
best
to
damage
the
towers
of
with
a
hundred
other
absurd
tales
but
on
this
occasion
poor
birotteau
felt
he
was
and
he
resigned
himself
to
eat
a
meal
without
engaging
in
conversation
after
a
while
however
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
that
silence
was
dangerous
for
his
digestion
and
he
boldly
remarked
this
coffee
is
that
act
of
courage
was
completely
wasted
then
after
looking
at
the
scrap
of
sky
visible
above
the
garden
between
the
two
buttresses
of
the
vicar
again
summoned
nerve
to
say
it
will
be
finer
weather
than
it
was
at
that
remark
mademoiselle
gamard
cast
her
most
gracious
look
on
the
abbe
troubert
and
immediately
turned
her
eyes
with
terrible
severity
on
birotteau
who
fortunately
by
that
time
was
looking
on
his
plate
no
creature
of
the
feminine
gender
was
ever
more
capable
of
presenting
to
the
mind
the
elegaic
nature
of
an
old
maid
than
mademoiselle
sophie
gamard
in
order
to
describe
a
being
whose
character
gives
a
momentous
interest
to
the
petty
events
of
the
present
drama
and
to
the
anterior
lives
of
the
actors
in
it
it
may
be
useful
to
give
a
summary
of
the
ideas
which
find
expression
in
the
being
of
an
old
maid
remembering
always
that
the
habits
of
life
form
the
soul
and
the
soul
forms
the
physical
presence
though
all
things
in
society
as
well
as
in
the
universe
are
said
to
have
a
purpose
there
do
exist
here
below
certain
beings
whose
purpose
and
utility
seem
inexplicable
moral
philosophy
and
political
economy
both
condemn
the
individual
who
consumes
without
producing
who
fills
a
place
on
the
earth
but
does
not
shed
upon
it
either
good
or
evil
for
evil
is
sometimes
good
the
meaning
of
which
is
not
at
once
made
manifest
it
is
seldom
that
old
maids
of
their
own
motion
enter
the
ranks
of
these
unproductive
beings
now
if
the
consciousness
of
work
done
gives
to
the
workers
a
sense
of
satisfaction
which
helps
them
to
support
life
the
certainty
of
being
a
useless
burden
must
one
would
think
produce
a
contrary
effect
and
fill
the
minds
of
such
fruitless
beings
with
the
same
contempt
for
themselves
which
they
inspire
in
others
this
harsh
social
reprobation
is
one
of
the
causes
which
contribute
to
fill
the
souls
of
old
maids
with
the
distress
that
appears
in
their
faces
prejudice
in
which
there
is
truth
does
cast
throughout
the
world
but
especially
in
france
a
great
stigma
on
the
woman
with
whom
no
man
has
been
willing
to
share
the
blessings
or
endure
the
ills
of
life
now
there
comes
to
all
unmarried
women
a
period
when
the
world
be
it
right
or
wrong
condemns
them
on
the
fact
of
this
contempt
this
rejection
if
they
are
ugly
the
goodness
of
their
characters
ought
to
have
compensated
for
their
natural
imperfections
if
on
the
contrary
they
are
handsome
that
fact
argues
that
their
misfortune
has
some
serious
cause
it
is
impossible
to
say
which
of
the
two
classes
is
most
deserving
of
rejection
if
on
the
other
hand
their
celibacy
is
deliberate
if
it
proceeds
from
a
desire
for
independence
neither
men
nor
mothers
will
forgive
their
disloyalty
to
womanly
devotion
evidenced
in
their
refusal
to
feed
those
passions
which
render
their
sex
so
affecting
to
renounce
the
pangs
of
womanhood
is
to
abjure
its
poetry
and
cease
to
merit
the
consolations
to
which
mothers
have
inalienable
rights
moreover
the
generous
sentiments
the
exquisite
qualities
of
a
woman
will
not
develop
unless
by
constant
exercise
by
remaining
unmarried
a
creature
of
the
female
sex
becomes
void
of
meaning
selfish
and
cold
she
creates
repulsion
this
implacable
judgment
of
the
world
is
unfortunately
too
just
to
leave
old
maids
in
ignorance
of
its
causes
such
ideas
shoot
up
in
their
hearts
as
naturally
as
the
effects
of
their
saddened
lives
appear
upon
their
features
consequently
they
wither
because
the
constant
expression
of
happiness
which
blooms
on
the
faces
of
other
women
and
gives
so
soft
a
grace
to
their
movements
has
never
existed
for
them
they
grow
sharp
and
peevish
because
all
human
beings
who
miss
their
vocation
are
unhappy
they
suffer
and
suffering
gives
birth
to
the
bitterness
of
in
fact
before
an
old
maid
blames
herself
for
her
isolation
she
blames
others
and
there
is
but
one
step
between
reproach
and
the
desire
for
revenge
but
more
than
this
the
ill
grace
and
want
of
charm
noticeable
in
these
women
are
the
necessary
result
of
their
lives
never
having
felt
a
desire
to
please
elegance
and
the
refinements
of
good
taste
are
foreign
to
them
they
see
only
themselves
in
themselves
this
instinct
brings
them
unconsciously
to
choose
the
things
that
are
most
convenient
to
themselves
at
the
sacrifice
of
those
which
might
be
more
agreeable
to
others
without
rendering
account
to
their
own
minds
of
the
difference
between
themselves
and
other
women
they
end
by
feeling
that
difference
and
suffering
under
it
jealousy
is
an
indelible
sentiment
in
the
female
breast
an
old
maid
s
soul
is
jealous
and
yet
void
for
she
knows
but
one
side
the
miserable
side
of
the
only
passion
men
will
allow
because
it
flatters
them
to
women
thus
thwarted
in
all
their
hopes
forced
to
deny
themselves
the
natural
development
of
their
natures
old
maids
endure
an
inward
torment
to
which
they
never
grow
accustomed
it
is
hard
at
any
age
above
all
for
a
woman
to
see
a
feeling
of
repulsion
on
the
faces
of
others
when
her
true
destiny
is
to
move
all
hearts
about
her
to
emotions
of
grace
and
love
one
result
of
this
inward
trouble
is
that
an
old
maid
s
glance
is
always
oblique
less
from
modesty
than
from
fear
and
shame
such
beings
never
forgive
society
for
their
false
position
because
they
never
forgive
themselves
for
it
now
it
is
impossible
for
a
woman
who
is
perpetually
at
war
with
herself
and
living
in
contradiction
to
her
true
life
to
leave
others
in
peace
or
refrain
from
envying
their
happiness
the
whole
range
of
these
sad
truths
could
be
read
in
the
dulled
gray
eyes
of
mademoiselle
gamard
the
dark
circles
that
surrounded
those
eyes
told
of
the
inward
conflicts
of
her
solitary
life
all
the
wrinkles
on
her
face
were
in
straight
lines
the
structure
of
her
forehead
and
cheeks
was
rigid
and
prominent
she
allowed
with
apparent
indifference
certain
scattered
hairs
once
brown
to
grow
upon
her
chin
her
thin
lips
scarcely
covered
teeth
that
were
too
long
though
still
quite
white
her
complexion
was
dark
and
her
hair
originally
black
had
turned
gray
from
frightful
headaches
a
misfortune
which
obliged
her
to
wear
a
false
front
not
knowing
how
to
put
it
on
so
as
to
conceal
the
junction
between
the
real
and
the
false
there
were
often
little
gaps
between
the
border
of
her
cap
and
the
black
string
with
which
this
always
badly
curled
was
fastened
to
her
head
her
gown
silk
in
summer
merino
in
winter
and
always
brown
in
color
was
invariably
rather
tight
for
her
angular
figure
and
thin
arms
her
collar
limp
and
bent
exposed
too
much
the
red
skin
of
a
neck
which
was
ribbed
like
an
in
winter
seen
in
the
light
her
origin
explains
to
some
extent
the
defects
of
her
conformation
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
a
peasant
who
had
risen
from
the
ranks
she
might
have
been
plump
at
eighteen
but
no
trace
remained
of
the
fair
complexion
and
pretty
color
of
which
she
was
wont
to
boast
the
tones
of
her
flesh
had
taken
the
pallid
tints
so
often
seen
in
her
aquiline
nose
was
the
feature
that
chiefly
proclaimed
the
despotism
of
her
nature
and
the
flat
shape
of
her
forehead
the
narrowness
of
her
mind
her
movements
had
an
odd
abruptness
which
precluded
all
grace
the
mere
motion
with
which
she
twitched
her
handkerchief
from
her
bag
and
blew
her
nose
with
a
loud
noise
would
have
shown
her
character
and
habits
to
a
keen
observer
being
rather
tall
she
held
herself
very
erect
and
justified
the
remark
of
a
naturalist
who
once
explained
the
peculiar
gait
of
old
maids
by
declaring
that
their
joints
were
consolidating
when
she
walked
her
movements
were
not
equally
distributed
over
her
whole
person
as
they
are
in
other
women
producing
those
graceful
undulations
which
are
so
attractive
she
moved
so
to
speak
in
a
single
block
seeming
to
advance
at
each
step
like
the
statue
of
the
commendatore
when
she
felt
in
good
humour
she
was
apt
like
other
old
maids
to
tell
of
the
chances
she
had
had
to
marry
and
of
her
fortunate
discovery
in
time
of
the
want
of
means
of
her
lovers
proving
unconsciously
that
her
worldly
judgment
was
better
than
her
heart
this
typical
figure
of
the
genus
old
maid
was
well
framed
by
the
grotesque
designs
representing
turkish
landscapes
on
a
varnished
paper
which
decorated
the
walls
of
the
mademoiselle
gamard
usually
sat
in
this
room
which
boasted
of
two
pier
tables
and
a
barometer
before
the
chair
of
each
abbe
was
a
little
cushion
covered
with
worsted
work
the
colors
of
which
were
faded
the
salon
in
which
she
received
company
was
worthy
of
its
mistress
it
will
be
visible
to
the
eye
at
once
when
we
state
that
it
went
by
the
name
of
the
yellow
the
curtains
were
yellow
the
furniture
and
walls
yellow
on
the
mantelpiece
surmounted
by
a
mirror
in
a
gilt
frame
the
candlesticks
and
a
clock
all
of
crystal
struck
the
eye
with
sharp
brilliancy
as
to
the
private
apartment
of
mademoiselle
gamard
no
one
had
ever
been
permitted
to
look
into
it
conjecture
alone
suggested
that
it
was
full
of
odds
and
ends
furniture
and
bits
of
stuff
and
pieces
dear
to
the
hearts
of
all
old
maids
such
was
the
woman
destined
to
exert
a
vast
influence
on
the
last
years
of
the
abbe
birotteau
for
want
of
exercising
in
nature
s
own
way
the
activity
bestowed
upon
women
and
yet
impelled
to
spend
it
in
some
way
or
other
mademoiselle
gamard
had
acquired
the
habit
of
using
it
in
petty
intrigues
provincial
cabals
and
those
schemes
which
occupy
sooner
or
later
the
lives
of
all
old
maids
birotteau
unhappily
had
developed
in
sophie
gamard
the
only
sentiments
which
it
was
possible
for
that
poor
creature
to
feel
those
of
hatred
a
passion
hitherto
latent
under
the
calmness
and
monotony
of
provincial
life
but
which
was
now
to
become
the
more
intense
because
it
was
spent
on
petty
things
and
in
the
midst
of
a
narrow
sphere
birotteau
was
one
of
those
beings
who
are
predestined
to
suffer
because
being
unable
to
see
things
they
can
not
avoid
them
to
them
the
worst
happens
yes
it
will
be
a
fine
day
replied
the
canon
after
a
pause
apparently
issuing
from
a
revery
and
wishing
to
conform
to
the
rules
of
politeness
birotteau
frightened
at
the
length
of
time
which
had
elapsed
between
the
question
and
the
answer
for
he
had
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
taken
his
coffee
without
uttering
a
word
now
left
the
where
his
heart
was
squeezed
as
if
in
a
vise
feeling
that
the
coffee
lay
heavy
on
his
stomach
he
went
to
walk
in
a
sad
mood
among
the
narrow
garden
paths
which
outlined
a
star
in
the
little
garden
as
he
turned
after
making
the
first
round
he
saw
mademoiselle
gamard
and
the
abbe
troubert
standing
and
silent
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
he
with
his
arms
folded
and
motionless
like
a
statue
on
a
tomb
she
leaning
against
the
blind
door
both
seemed
to
be
gazing
at
him
and
counting
his
steps
nothing
is
so
embarrassing
to
a
creature
naturally
timid
as
to
feel
itself
the
object
of
a
close
examination
and
if
that
is
made
by
the
eyes
of
hatred
the
sort
of
suffering
it
causes
is
changed
into
intolerable
martyrdom
presently
birotteau
fancied
he
was
preventing
mademoiselle
gamard
and
the
abbe
from
walking
in
the
narrow
path
that
idea
inspired
equally
by
fear
and
kindness
became
so
strong
that
he
left
the
garden
and
went
to
the
church
thinking
no
longer
of
his
canonry
so
absorbed
was
he
by
the
disheartening
tyranny
of
the
old
maid
luckily
for
him
he
happened
to
find
much
to
do
at
several
funerals
a
marriage
and
two
baptisms
thus
employed
he
forgot
his
griefs
when
his
stomach
told
him
that
dinner
was
ready
he
drew
out
his
watch
and
saw
not
without
alarm
that
it
was
some
minutes
after
four
being
well
aware
of
mademoiselle
gamard
s
punctuality
he
hurried
back
to
the
house
he
saw
at
once
on
passing
the
kitchen
door
that
the
first
course
had
been
removed
when
he
reached
the
the
old
maid
said
with
a
tone
of
voice
in
which
were
mingled
sour
rebuke
and
joy
at
being
able
to
blame
him
it
is
four
monsieur
birotteau
you
know
we
are
not
to
wait
for
the
vicar
looked
at
the
clock
in
the
and
saw
at
once
by
the
way
the
gauze
which
protected
it
from
dust
had
been
moved
that
his
landlady
had
opened
the
face
of
the
dial
and
set
the
hands
in
advance
of
the
clock
of
the
cathedral
he
could
make
no
remark
had
he
uttered
his
suspicion
it
would
only
have
caused
and
apparently
justified
one
of
those
fierce
and
eloquent
expositions
to
which
mademoiselle
gamard
like
other
women
of
her
class
knew
very
well
how
to
give
vent
in
particular
cases
the
thousand
and
one
annoyances
which
a
servant
will
sometimes
make
her
master
bear
or
a
woman
her
husband
were
instinctively
divined
by
mademoiselle
gamard
and
used
upon
birotteau
the
way
in
which
she
delighted
in
plotting
against
the
poor
vicar
s
domestic
comfort
bore
all
the
marks
of
what
we
must
call
a
profoundly
malignant
genius
yet
she
so
managed
that
she
was
never
so
far
as
eye
could
see
in
the
wrong
iii
eight
days
after
the
date
on
which
this
history
began
the
new
arrangements
of
the
household
and
the
relations
which
grew
up
between
the
abbe
birotteau
and
mademoiselle
gamard
revealed
to
the
former
the
existence
of
a
plot
which
had
been
hatching
for
the
last
six
months
as
long
as
the
old
maid
exercised
her
vengeance
in
an
underhand
way
and
the
vicar
was
able
to
shut
his
eyes
to
it
and
refuse
to
believe
in
her
malevolent
intentions
the
moral
effect
upon
him
was
slight
but
since
the
affair
of
the
candlestick
and
the
altered
clock
birotteau
would
doubt
no
longer
that
he
was
under
an
eye
of
hatred
turned
fully
upon
him
from
that
moment
he
fell
into
despair
seeing
everywhere
the
skinny
clawlike
fingers
of
mademoiselle
gamard
ready
to
hook
into
his
heart
the
old
maid
happy
in
a
sentiment
as
fruitful
of
emotions
as
that
of
vengeance
enjoyed
circling
and
swooping
above
the
vicar
as
a
bird
of
prey
hovers
and
swoops
above
a
before
pouncing
down
upon
it
and
devouring
it
she
had
long
since
laid
a
plan
which
the
poor
dumbfounded
priest
was
quite
incapable
of
imagining
and
which
she
now
proceeded
to
unfold
with
that
genius
for
little
things
often
shown
by
solitary
persons
whose
souls
incapable
of
feeling
the
grandeur
of
true
piety
fling
themselves
into
the
details
of
outward
devotion
the
petty
nature
of
his
troubles
prevented
birotteau
always
effusive
and
liking
to
be
pitied
and
consoled
from
enjoying
the
soothing
pleasure
of
taking
his
friends
into
his
confidence
a
last
but
cruel
aggravation
of
his
misery
the
little
amount
of
tact
which
he
derived
from
his
timidity
made
him
fear
to
seem
ridiculous
in
concerning
himself
with
such
pettiness
and
yet
those
petty
things
made
up
the
sum
of
his
existence
that
cherished
existence
full
of
busyness
about
nothings
and
of
nothingness
in
its
business
a
colorless
barren
life
in
which
strong
feelings
were
misfortunes
and
the
absence
of
emotion
happiness
the
poor
priest
s
paradise
was
changed
in
a
moment
into
hell
his
sufferings
became
intolerable
the
terror
he
felt
at
the
prospect
of
a
discussion
with
mademoiselle
gamard
increased
day
by
day
the
secret
distress
which
blighted
his
life
began
to
injure
his
health
one
morning
as
he
put
on
his
mottled
blue
stockings
he
noticed
a
marked
diminution
in
the
circumference
of
his
calves
horrified
by
so
cruel
and
undeniable
a
symptom
he
resolved
to
make
an
effort
and
appeal
to
the
abbe
troubert
requesting
him
to
intervene
officially
between
mademoiselle
gamard
and
himself
when
he
found
himself
in
presence
of
the
imposing
canon
who
in
order
to
receive
his
visitor
in
a
bare
and
cheerless
room
had
hastily
quitted
a
study
full
of
papers
where
he
worked
incessantly
and
where
no
one
was
ever
admitted
the
vicar
felt
half
ashamed
at
speaking
of
mademoiselle
gamard
s
provocations
to
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
so
gravely
occupied
but
after
going
through
the
agony
of
the
mental
deliberations
which
all
humble
undecided
and
feeble
persons
endure
about
things
of
even
no
importance
he
decided
not
without
much
swelling
and
beating
of
the
heart
to
explain
his
position
to
the
abbe
troubert
the
canon
listened
in
a
cold
grave
manner
trying
but
in
vain
to
repress
an
occasional
smile
which
to
more
intelligent
eyes
than
those
of
the
vicar
might
have
betrayed
the
emotions
of
a
secret
satisfaction
a
flame
seemed
to
dart
from
his
eyelids
when
birotteau
pictured
with
the
eloquence
of
genuine
feeling
the
constant
bitterness
he
was
made
to
swallow
but
troubert
laid
his
hand
above
those
lids
with
a
gesture
very
common
to
thinkers
maintaining
the
dignified
demeanor
which
was
usual
with
him
when
the
vicar
had
ceased
to
speak
he
would
indeed
have
been
puzzled
had
he
sought
on
troubert
s
face
marbled
with
yellow
blotches
even
more
yellow
than
his
usually
bilious
skin
for
any
trace
of
the
feelings
he
must
have
excited
in
that
mysterious
priest
after
a
moment
s
silence
the
canon
made
one
of
those
answers
which
required
long
study
before
their
meaning
could
be
thoroughly
perceived
though
later
they
proved
to
reflecting
persons
the
astonishing
depths
of
his
spirit
and
the
power
of
his
mind
he
simply
crushed
birotteau
by
telling
him
that
these
things
amazed
him
all
the
more
because
he
should
never
have
suspected
their
existence
were
it
not
for
his
brother
s
confession
he
attributed
such
stupidity
on
his
part
to
the
gravity
of
his
occupations
his
labors
the
absorption
in
which
his
mind
was
held
by
certain
elevated
thoughts
which
prevented
his
taking
due
notice
of
the
petty
details
of
he
made
the
vicar
observe
but
without
appearing
to
censure
the
conduct
of
a
man
whose
age
and
connections
deserved
all
respect
that
in
former
days
recluses
thought
little
about
their
food
and
lodging
in
the
solitude
of
their
retreats
where
they
were
lost
in
holy
contemplations
and
that
in
our
days
priests
could
make
a
retreat
for
themselves
in
the
solitude
of
their
own
then
reverting
to
birotteau
s
affairs
he
added
that
such
disagreements
were
a
novelty
to
him
for
twelve
years
nothing
of
the
kind
had
occurred
between
mademoiselle
gamard
and
the
venerable
abbe
chapeloud
as
for
himself
he
might
no
doubt
be
an
arbitrator
between
the
vicar
and
their
landlady
because
his
friendship
for
that
person
had
never
gone
beyond
the
limits
imposed
by
the
church
on
her
faithful
servants
but
if
so
justice
demanded
that
he
should
hear
both
sides
he
certainly
saw
no
change
in
mademoiselle
gamard
who
seemed
to
him
the
same
as
ever
he
had
always
submitted
to
a
few
of
her
caprices
knowing
that
the
excellent
woman
was
kindness
and
gentleness
itself
the
slight
fluctuations
of
her
temper
should
be
attributed
he
thought
to
sufferings
caused
by
a
pulmonary
affection
of
which
she
said
little
resigning
herself
to
bear
them
in
a
truly
christian
he
ended
by
assuring
the
vicar
that
if
he
stayed
a
few
years
longer
in
mademoiselle
gamard
s
house
he
would
learn
to
understand
her
better
and
acknowledge
the
real
value
of
her
excellent
birotteau
left
the
room
confounded
in
the
direful
necessity
of
consulting
no
one
he
now
judged
mademoiselle
gamard
as
he
would
himself
and
the
poor
man
fancied
that
if
he
left
her
house
for
a
few
days
he
might
extinguish
for
want
of
fuel
the
dislike
the
old
maid
felt
for
him
he
accordingly
resolved
to
spend
as
he
formerly
did
a
week
or
so
at
a
where
madame
de
listomere
passed
her
autumns
a
season
when
the
sky
is
usually
pure
and
tender
in
touraine
poor
man
in
so
doing
he
did
the
thing
that
was
most
desired
by
his
terrible
enemy
whose
plans
could
only
have
been
brought
to
nought
by
the
resistant
patience
of
a
monk
but
the
vicar
unable
to
divine
them
not
understanding
even
his
own
affairs
was
doomed
to
fall
like
a
lamb
at
the
butcher
s
first
blow
madame
de
listomere
s
situated
on
the
embankment
which
lies
between
tours
and
the
heights
of
with
a
southern
exposure
and
surrounded
by
rocks
combined
the
charms
of
the
country
with
the
pleasures
of
the
town
it
took
but
ten
minutes
from
the
bridge
of
tours
to
reach
the
house
which
was
called
the
alouette
a
great
advantage
in
a
region
where
no
one
will
put
himself
out
for
anything
whatsoever
not
even
to
seek
a
pleasure
the
abbe
birotteau
had
been
about
ten
days
at
the
alouette
when
one
morning
while
he
was
breakfasting
the
porter
came
to
say
that
monsieur
caron
desired
to
speak
with
him
monsieur
caron
was
mademoiselle
gamard
s
laywer
and
had
charge
of
her
affairs
birotteau
not
remembering
this
and
unable
to
think
of
any
matter
of
litigation
between
himself
and
others
left
the
table
to
see
the
lawyer
in
a
stage
of
great
agitation
he
found
him
modestly
seated
on
the
balustrade
of
a
terrace
your
intention
of
ceasing
to
reside
in
mademoiselle
gamard
s
house
being
made
evident
began
the
man
of
business
eh
monsieur
cried
the
abbe
birotteau
interrupting
him
i
have
not
the
slightest
intention
of
leaving
nevertheless
monsieur
replied
the
lawyer
you
must
have
had
some
agreement
in
the
matter
with
mademoiselle
for
she
has
sent
me
to
ask
how
long
you
intend
to
remain
in
the
country
the
event
of
a
long
absence
was
not
foreseen
in
the
agreement
and
may
lead
to
a
contest
now
mademoiselle
gamard
understanding
that
your
board
monsieur
said
birotteau
amazed
and
again
interrupting
the
lawyer
i
did
not
suppose
it
necessary
to
employ
as
it
were
legal
means
to
mademoiselle
gamard
who
is
anxious
to
avoid
all
dispute
said
monsieur
caron
has
sent
me
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
well
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
return
said
the
abbe
i
shall
then
have
taken
advice
in
the
the
withdrew
the
poor
vicar
frightened
at
the
persistence
with
which
mademoiselle
gamard
pursued
him
returned
to
the
with
his
face
so
convulsed
that
everybody
cried
out
when
they
saw
him
what
the
matter
monsieur
birotteau
the
abbe
in
despair
sat
down
without
a
word
so
crushed
was
he
by
the
vague
presence
of
approaching
disaster
but
after
breakfast
when
his
friends
gathered
round
him
before
a
comfortable
fire
birotteau
naively
related
the
history
of
his
troubles
his
hearers
who
were
beginning
to
weary
of
the
monotony
of
a
were
keenly
interested
in
a
plot
so
thoroughly
in
keeping
with
the
life
of
the
provinces
they
all
took
sides
with
the
abbe
against
the
old
maid
don
t
you
see
my
dear
friend
said
madame
de
listomere
that
the
abbe
troubert
wants
your
apartment
here
the
historian
ought
to
sketch
this
lady
but
it
occurs
to
him
that
even
those
who
are
ignorant
of
sterne
s
system
of
cognomology
can
not
pronounce
the
three
words
madame
de
listomere
without
picturing
her
to
themselves
as
noble
and
dignified
softening
the
sternness
of
rigid
devotion
by
the
gracious
elegance
and
the
courteous
manners
of
the
old
monarchical
regime
kind
but
a
little
stiff
slightly
nasal
in
voice
allowing
herself
the
perusal
of
la
nouvelle
heloise
and
still
wearing
her
own
hair
the
abbe
birotteau
must
not
yield
to
that
old
vixen
cried
monsieur
de
listomere
a
lieutenant
in
the
navy
who
was
spending
a
furlough
with
his
aunt
if
the
vicar
has
pluck
and
will
follow
my
suggestions
he
will
soon
recover
his
all
present
began
to
analyze
the
conduct
of
mademoiselle
gamard
with
the
keen
perceptions
which
characterize
provincials
to
whom
no
one
can
deny
the
talent
of
knowing
how
to
lay
bare
the
most
secret
motives
of
human
actions
you
don
t
see
the
whole
thing
yet
said
an
old
landowner
who
knew
the
region
well
there
is
something
serious
behind
all
this
which
i
can
t
yet
make
out
the
abbe
troubert
is
too
deep
to
be
fathomed
at
once
our
dear
birotteau
is
at
the
beginning
of
his
troubles
besides
would
he
be
left
in
peace
and
comfort
even
if
he
did
give
up
his
lodging
to
troubert
i
doubt
it
if
caron
came
here
to
tell
you
that
you
intended
to
leave
mademoiselle
gamard
he
added
turning
to
the
bewildered
priest
no
doubt
mademoiselle
gamard
s
intention
is
to
turn
you
out
therefore
you
will
have
to
go
whether
you
like
it
or
not
her
sort
of
people
play
a
sure
game
they
risk
this
old
gentleman
monsieur
de
bourbonne
could
sum
up
and
estimate
provincial
ideas
as
correctly
as
voltaire
summarized
the
spirit
of
his
times
he
was
thin
and
tall
and
chose
to
exhibit
in
the
matter
of
clothes
the
quiet
indifference
of
a
landowner
whose
territorial
value
is
quoted
in
the
department
his
face
tanned
by
the
touraine
sun
was
less
intellectual
than
shrewd
accustomed
to
weigh
his
words
and
measure
his
actions
he
concealed
a
profound
vigilance
behind
a
misleading
appearance
of
simplicity
a
very
slight
observation
of
him
sufficed
to
show
that
like
a
norman
peasant
he
invariably
held
the
upper
hand
in
business
matters
he
was
an
authority
on
the
leading
science
of
touraine
he
had
managed
to
extend
the
meadow
lands
of
his
domain
by
taking
in
a
part
of
the
alluvial
soil
of
the
loire
without
getting
into
difficulties
with
the
state
this
clever
proceeding
gave
him
the
reputation
of
a
man
of
talent
if
monsieur
de
bourbonne
s
conversation
pleased
you
and
you
were
to
ask
who
he
was
of
a
tourainean
ho
a
sly
old
fox
would
be
the
answer
of
those
who
were
envious
of
him
and
they
were
many
in
touraine
as
in
many
of
the
provinces
jealousy
is
the
root
of
language
monsieur
de
bourbonne
s
remark
occasioned
a
momentary
silence
during
which
the
persons
who
composed
the
little
party
seemed
to
be
reflecting
meanwhile
mademoiselle
salomon
de
villenoix
was
announced
she
came
from
tours
in
the
hope
of
being
useful
to
the
poor
abbe
and
the
news
she
brought
completely
changed
the
aspect
of
the
affair
as
she
entered
every
one
except
monsieur
de
bourbonne
was
urging
birotteau
to
hold
his
own
against
troubert
and
gamard
under
the
auspices
of
the
aristocratic
society
of
the
place
which
would
certainly
stand
by
him
the
to
whom
the
appointments
to
office
are
entrusted
is
very
ill
said
mademoiselle
salomon
and
the
archbishop
has
delegated
his
powers
to
the
abbe
troubert
provisionally
the
canonry
will
of
course
depend
wholly
upon
him
now
last
evening
at
mademoiselle
de
la
blottiere
s
the
abbe
poirel
talked
about
the
annoyances
which
the
abbe
birotteau
had
inflicted
on
mademoiselle
gamard
as
though
he
were
trying
to
cast
all
the
blame
on
our
good
abbe
the
abbe
birotteau
he
said
is
a
man
to
whom
the
abbe
chapeloud
was
absolutely
necessary
and
since
the
death
of
that
venerable
man
he
has
shown
and
then
came
suggestions
calumnies
you
understand
troubert
will
be
made
said
monsieur
de
bourbonne
sententiously
come
cried
madame
de
listomere
turning
to
birotteau
which
do
you
prefer
to
be
made
a
canon
or
continue
to
live
with
mademoiselle
gamard
to
be
a
canon
cried
the
whole
company
well
then
resumed
madame
de
listomere
you
must
let
the
abbe
troubert
and
mademoiselle
gamard
have
things
their
own
way
by
sending
caron
here
they
mean
to
let
you
know
indirectly
that
if
you
consent
to
leave
the
house
you
shall
be
made
canon
one
good
turn
deserves
every
one
present
applauded
madame
de
listomere
s
sagacity
except
her
nephew
the
baron
de
listomere
who
remarked
in
a
comic
tone
to
monsieur
de
bourbonne
i
would
like
to
have
seen
a
fight
between
the
gamard
and
the
but
unhappily
for
the
vicar
forces
were
not
equal
between
these
persons
of
the
best
society
and
the
old
maid
supported
by
the
abbe
troubert
the
time
soon
came
when
the
struggle
developed
openly
went
on
increasing
and
finally
assumed
immense
proportions
by
the
advice
of
madame
de
listomere
and
most
of
her
friends
who
were
now
eagerly
enlisted
in
a
matter
which
threw
such
excitement
into
their
vapid
provincial
lives
a
servant
was
sent
to
bring
back
monsieur
caron
the
lawyer
returned
with
surprising
celerity
which
alarmed
no
one
but
monsieur
de
bourbonne
let
us
postpone
all
decision
until
we
are
better
informed
was
the
advice
of
that
fabius
in
a
whose
prudent
reflections
revealed
to
him
the
meaning
of
these
moves
on
the
tourainean
he
tried
to
enlighten
birotteau
on
the
dangers
of
his
position
but
the
wisdom
of
the
old
did
not
serve
the
passions
of
the
moment
and
he
obtained
but
little
attention
the
conference
between
the
lawyer
and
birotteau
was
short
the
vicar
came
back
quite
terrified
he
wants
me
to
sign
a
paper
stating
my
relinquishment
of
that
s
formidable
language
said
the
naval
lieutenant
what
does
it
mean
asked
madame
de
listomere
merely
that
the
abbe
must
declare
in
writing
his
intention
of
leaving
mademoiselle
gamard
s
house
said
monsieur
de
bourbonne
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
is
that
all
said
madame
de
listomere
then
sign
it
at
once
she
added
turning
to
birotteau
if
you
positively
decide
to
leave
her
house
there
can
be
no
harm
in
declaring
that
such
is
your
birotteau
s
will
that
is
true
said
monsieur
de
bourbonne
closing
his
with
a
gesture
the
significance
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
render
for
it
was
a
language
in
itself
but
writing
is
always
dangerous
he
added
putting
his
on
the
mantelpiece
with
an
air
and
manner
that
alarmed
the
vicar
birotteau
was
so
bewildered
by
the
upsetting
of
all
his
ideas
by
the
rapidity
of
events
which
found
him
defenceless
by
the
ease
with
which
his
friends
were
settling
the
most
cherished
matters
of
his
solitary
life
that
he
remained
silent
and
motionless
as
if
moonstruck
thinking
of
nothing
though
listening
and
striving
to
understand
the
meaning
of
the
rapid
sentences
the
assembled
company
addressed
to
him
he
took
the
paper
monsieur
caron
had
given
him
and
read
it
as
if
he
were
giving
his
mind
to
the
lawyer
s
document
but
the
act
was
merely
mechanical
he
signed
the
paper
by
which
he
declared
that
he
left
mademoiselle
gamard
s
house
of
his
own
wish
and
will
and
that
he
had
been
fed
and
lodged
while
there
according
to
the
terms
originally
agreed
upon
when
the
vicar
had
signed
the
document
monsieur
caron
took
it
and
asked
where
his
client
was
to
send
the
things
left
by
the
abbe
in
her
house
and
belonging
to
him
birotteau
replied
that
they
could
be
sent
to
madame
de
listomere
s
that
lady
making
him
a
sign
that
she
would
receive
him
never
doubting
that
he
would
soon
be
a
canon
monsieur
de
bourbonne
asked
to
see
the
paper
the
deed
of
relinquishment
which
the
abbe
had
just
signed
monsieur
caron
gave
it
to
him
how
is
this
he
said
to
the
vicar
after
reading
it
it
appears
that
written
documents
already
exist
between
you
and
mademoiselle
gamard
where
are
they
and
what
do
they
stipulate
the
deed
is
in
my
library
replied
birotteau
do
you
know
the
tenor
of
it
said
monsieur
de
bourbonne
to
the
lawyer
no
monsieur
said
caron
stretching
out
his
hand
to
regain
the
fatal
document
ha
thought
the
old
man
you
know
my
good
friend
what
that
deed
contains
but
you
are
not
paid
to
tell
us
and
he
returned
the
paper
to
the
lawyer
where
can
i
put
my
things
cried
birotteau
my
books
my
beautiful
and
pictures
my
red
furniture
and
all
my
treasures
the
helpless
despair
of
the
poor
man
thus
torn
up
as
it
were
by
the
roots
was
so
artless
it
showed
so
plainly
the
purity
of
his
ways
and
his
ignorance
of
the
things
of
life
that
madame
de
listomere
and
mademoiselle
de
salomon
talked
to
him
and
consoled
him
in
the
tone
which
mothers
take
when
they
promise
a
plaything
to
their
children
don
t
fret
about
such
trifles
they
said
we
will
find
you
some
place
less
cold
and
dismal
than
mademoiselle
gamard
s
gloomy
house
if
we
can
t
find
anything
you
like
one
or
other
of
us
will
take
you
to
live
with
us
come
let
s
play
a
game
of
backgammon
you
can
go
and
see
the
abbe
troubert
and
ask
him
to
push
your
claims
to
the
canonry
and
you
ll
see
how
cordially
he
will
receive
feeble
folk
are
as
easily
reassured
as
they
are
frightened
so
the
poor
abbe
dazzled
at
the
prospect
of
living
with
madame
de
listomere
forgot
the
destruction
now
completed
of
the
happiness
he
had
so
long
desired
and
so
delightfully
enjoyed
but
at
night
before
going
to
sleep
the
distress
of
a
man
to
whom
the
fuss
of
moving
and
the
breaking
up
of
all
his
habits
was
like
the
end
of
the
world
came
upon
him
and
he
racked
his
brains
to
imagine
how
he
could
ever
find
such
a
good
place
for
his
as
the
gallery
in
the
old
maid
s
house
fancying
he
saw
his
books
scattered
about
his
furniture
defaced
his
regular
life
turned
he
asked
himself
for
the
thousandth
time
why
the
first
year
spent
in
mademoiselle
gamard
s
house
had
been
so
sweet
the
second
so
cruel
his
troubles
were
a
pit
in
which
his
reason
floundered
the
canonry
seemed
to
him
small
compensation
for
so
much
misery
and
he
compared
his
life
to
a
stocking
in
which
a
single
dropped
stitch
resulted
in
destroying
the
whole
fabric
mademoiselle
salomon
remained
to
him
but
alas
in
losing
his
old
illusions
the
poor
priest
dared
not
trust
in
any
later
friendship
in
the
citta
dolente
of
spinsterhood
we
often
meet
especially
in
france
with
women
whose
lives
are
a
sacrifice
nobly
and
daily
offered
to
noble
sentiments
some
remain
proudly
faithful
to
a
heart
which
death
tore
from
them
martyrs
of
love
they
learn
the
secrets
of
womanhood
only
though
their
souls
others
obey
some
family
pride
which
in
our
days
and
to
our
shame
decreases
steadily
these
devote
themselves
to
the
welfare
of
a
brother
or
to
orphan
nephews
they
are
mothers
while
remaining
virgins
such
old
maids
attain
to
the
highest
heroism
of
their
sex
by
consecrating
all
feminine
feelings
to
the
help
of
sorrow
they
idealize
womanhood
by
renouncing
the
rewards
of
woman
s
destiny
accepting
its
pains
they
live
surrounded
by
the
splendour
of
their
devotion
and
men
respectfully
bow
the
head
before
their
faded
features
mademoiselle
de
sombreuil
was
neither
wife
nor
maid
she
was
and
ever
will
be
a
living
poem
mademoiselle
salomon
de
villenoix
belonged
to
the
race
of
these
heroic
beings
her
devotion
was
religiously
sublime
inasmuch
as
it
won
her
no
glory
after
being
for
years
a
daily
agony
beautiful
and
young
she
loved
and
was
beloved
her
lover
lost
his
reason
for
five
years
she
gave
herself
with
love
s
devotion
to
the
mere
mechanical
of
that
unhappy
man
whose
madness
she
so
penetrated
that
she
never
believed
him
mad
she
was
simple
in
manner
frank
in
speech
and
her
pallid
face
was
not
lacking
in
strength
and
character
though
its
features
were
regular
she
never
spoke
of
the
events
of
her
life
but
at
times
a
sudden
quiver
passed
over
her
as
she
listened
to
the
story
of
some
sad
or
dreadful
incident
thus
betraying
the
emotions
that
great
sufferings
had
developed
within
her
she
had
come
to
live
at
tours
after
losing
the
companion
of
her
life
but
she
was
not
appreciated
there
at
her
true
value
and
was
thought
to
be
merely
an
amiable
woman
she
did
much
good
and
attached
herself
by
preference
to
feeble
beings
for
that
reason
the
poor
vicar
had
naturally
inspired
her
with
a
deep
interest
mademoiselle
de
villenoix
who
returned
to
tours
the
next
morning
took
birotteau
with
her
and
set
him
down
on
the
quay
of
the
cathedral
leaving
him
to
make
his
own
way
to
the
cloister
where
he
was
bent
on
going
to
save
at
least
the
canonry
and
to
superintend
the
removal
of
his
furniture
he
rang
not
without
violent
palpitations
of
the
heart
at
the
door
of
the
house
whither
for
fourteen
years
he
had
come
daily
and
where
he
had
lived
blissfully
and
from
which
he
was
now
exiled
forever
after
dreaming
that
he
should
die
there
in
peace
like
his
friend
chapeloud
marianne
was
surprised
at
the
vicar
s
visit
he
told
her
that
he
had
come
to
see
the
abbe
troubert
and
turned
towards
the
apartment
where
the
canon
lived
but
marianne
called
to
him
not
there
monsieur
le
vicaire
the
abbe
troubert
is
in
your
old
these
words
gave
the
vicar
a
frightful
shock
he
was
forced
to
comprehend
both
troubert
s
character
and
the
depths
of
the
revenge
so
slowly
brought
about
when
he
found
the
canon
settled
in
chapeloud
s
library
seated
in
chapeloud
s
handsome
armchair
sleeping
no
doubt
in
chapeloud
s
bed
and
disinheriting
at
last
the
friend
of
chapeloud
the
man
who
for
so
many
years
had
confined
him
to
mademoiselle
gamard
s
house
by
preventing
his
advancement
in
the
church
and
closing
the
best
salons
in
tours
against
him
by
what
magic
wand
had
the
present
transformation
taken
place
surely
these
things
belonged
to
birotteau
and
yet
observing
the
sardonic
air
with
which
troubert
glanced
at
that
bookcase
the
poor
abbe
knew
that
the
future
felt
certain
of
possessing
the
spoils
of
those
he
had
so
bitterly
hated
chapeloud
as
an
enemy
and
birotteau
in
and
through
whom
chapeloud
still
thwarted
him
ideas
rose
in
the
heart
of
the
poor
man
at
the
sight
and
plunged
him
into
a
sort
of
vision
he
stood
motionless
as
though
fascinated
by
troubert
s
eyes
which
fixed
themselves
upon
him
i
do
not
suppose
monsieur
said
birotteau
at
last
that
you
intend
to
deprive
me
of
the
things
that
belong
to
me
mademoiselle
may
have
been
impatient
to
give
you
better
lodgings
but
she
ought
to
have
been
sufficiently
just
to
give
me
time
to
pack
my
books
and
remove
my
monsieur
said
the
abbe
troubert
coldly
not
permitting
any
sign
of
emotion
to
appear
on
his
face
mademoiselle
gamard
told
me
yesterday
of
your
departure
the
cause
of
which
is
still
unknown
to
me
if
she
installed
me
here
at
once
it
was
from
necessity
the
abbe
poirel
has
taken
my
apartment
i
do
not
know
if
the
furniture
and
things
that
are
in
these
rooms
belong
to
you
or
to
mademoiselle
but
if
they
are
yours
you
know
her
scrupulous
honesty
the
sanctity
of
her
life
is
the
guarantee
of
her
rectitude
as
for
me
you
are
well
aware
of
my
simple
modes
of
living
i
have
slept
for
fifteen
years
in
a
bare
room
without
complaining
of
the
dampness
which
eventually
will
have
caused
my
death
nevertheless
if
you
wish
to
return
to
this
apartment
i
will
cede
it
to
you
after
hearing
these
terrible
words
birotteau
forgot
the
canonry
and
ran
downstairs
as
quickly
as
a
young
man
to
find
mademoiselle
gamard
he
met
her
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
on
the
broad
tiled
landing
which
united
the
two
wings
of
the
house
mademoiselle
he
said
bowing
to
her
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
bitter
and
derisive
smile
that
was
on
her
lips
nor
to
the
extraordinary
flame
in
her
eyes
which
made
them
lucent
as
a
tiger
s
i
can
not
understand
how
it
is
that
you
have
not
waited
until
i
removed
my
furniture
before
what
she
said
interrupting
him
is
it
possible
that
your
things
have
not
been
left
at
madame
de
listomere
s
but
my
furniture
haven
t
you
read
your
deed
said
the
old
maid
in
a
tone
which
would
have
to
be
rendered
in
music
before
the
shades
of
meaning
that
hatred
is
able
to
put
into
the
accent
of
every
word
could
be
fully
shown
mademoiselle
gamard
seemed
to
rise
in
stature
her
eyes
shone
her
face
expanded
her
whole
person
quivered
with
pleasure
the
abbe
troubert
opened
a
window
to
get
a
better
light
on
the
folio
volume
he
was
reading
birotteau
stood
as
if
a
thunderbolt
had
stricken
him
mademoiselle
gamard
made
his
ears
hum
when
she
enunciated
in
a
voice
as
clear
as
a
cornet
the
following
sentence
was
it
not
agreed
that
if
you
left
my
house
your
furniture
should
belong
to
me
to
indemnify
me
for
the
difference
in
the
price
of
board
paid
by
you
and
that
paid
by
the
late
venerable
abbe
chapeloud
now
as
the
abbe
poirel
has
just
been
appointed
canon
hearing
the
last
words
birotteau
made
a
feeble
bow
as
if
to
take
leave
of
the
old
maid
and
left
the
house
precipitately
he
was
afraid
if
he
stayed
longer
that
he
should
break
down
utterly
and
give
too
great
a
triumph
to
his
implacable
enemies
walking
like
a
drunken
man
he
at
last
reached
madame
de
listomere
s
house
where
he
found
in
one
of
the
lower
rooms
his
linen
his
clothing
and
all
his
papers
packed
in
a
trunk
when
he
eyes
fell
on
these
few
remnants
of
his
possessions
the
unhappy
priest
sat
down
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
to
conceal
his
tears
from
the
sight
of
others
the
abbe
poirel
was
canon
he
birotteau
had
neither
home
nor
means
nor
furniture
fortunately
mademoiselle
salomon
happened
to
drive
past
the
house
and
the
porter
who
saw
and
comprehended
the
despair
of
the
poor
abbe
made
a
sign
to
the
coachman
after
exchanging
a
few
words
with
mademoiselle
salomon
the
porter
persuaded
the
vicar
to
let
himself
be
placed
half
dead
as
he
was
in
the
carriage
of
his
faithful
friend
to
whom
he
was
unable
to
speak
connectedly
mademoiselle
salomon
alarmed
at
the
momentary
derangement
of
a
head
that
was
always
feeble
took
him
back
at
once
to
the
alouette
believing
that
this
beginning
of
mental
alienation
was
an
effect
produced
by
the
sudden
news
of
abbe
poirel
s
nomination
she
knew
nothing
of
course
of
the
fatal
agreement
made
by
the
abbe
with
mademoiselle
gamard
for
the
excellent
reason
that
he
did
not
know
of
it
himself
and
because
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
the
comical
is
often
mingled
with
the
pathetic
the
singular
replies
of
the
poor
abbe
made
her
smile
chapeloud
was
right
he
said
he
is
a
monster
who
she
asked
chapeloud
he
has
taken
you
mean
poirel
no
at
last
they
reached
the
alouette
where
the
priest
s
friends
gave
him
such
tender
care
that
towards
evening
he
grew
calmer
and
was
able
to
give
them
an
account
of
what
had
happened
during
the
morning
the
phlegmatic
old
fox
asked
to
see
the
deed
which
on
thinking
the
matter
over
seemed
to
him
to
contain
the
solution
of
the
enigma
birotteau
drew
the
fatal
stamped
paper
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
monsieur
de
bourbonne
who
read
it
rapidly
and
soon
came
upon
the
following
clause
whereas
a
difference
exists
of
eight
hundred
francs
yearly
between
the
price
of
board
paid
by
the
late
abbe
chapeloud
and
that
at
which
the
said
sophie
gamard
agrees
to
take
into
her
house
on
the
stipulated
condition
the
said
francois
birotteau
and
whereas
it
is
understood
that
the
undersigned
francois
birotteau
is
not
able
for
some
years
to
pay
the
full
price
charged
to
the
other
boarders
of
mademoiselle
gamard
more
especially
the
abbe
troubert
the
said
birotteau
does
hereby
engage
in
consideration
of
certain
sums
of
money
advanced
by
the
undersigned
sophie
gamard
to
leave
her
as
indemnity
all
the
household
property
of
which
he
may
die
possessed
or
to
transfer
the
same
to
her
should
he
for
any
reason
whatever
or
at
any
time
voluntarily
give
up
the
apartment
now
leased
to
him
and
thus
derive
no
further
profit
from
the
engagements
made
by
mademoiselle
gamard
for
his
benefit
confound
her
what
an
agreement
cried
the
old
gentleman
the
said
sophie
gamard
is
armed
with
poor
birotteau
never
imagined
in
his
childish
brain
that
anything
could
ever
separate
him
from
that
house
where
he
expected
to
live
and
die
with
mademoiselle
gamard
he
had
no
remembrance
whatever
of
that
clause
the
terms
of
which
he
had
not
discussed
for
they
had
seemed
quite
just
to
him
at
a
time
when
in
his
great
anxiety
to
enter
the
old
maid
s
house
he
would
readily
have
signed
any
and
all
legal
documents
she
had
offered
him
his
simplicity
was
so
guileless
and
mademoiselle
gamard
s
conduct
so
atrocious
the
fate
of
the
poor
old
man
seemed
so
deplorable
and
his
natural
helplessness
made
him
so
touching
that
in
the
first
glow
of
her
indignation
madame
de
listomere
exclaimed
i
made
you
put
your
signature
to
that
document
which
has
ruined
you
i
am
bound
to
give
you
back
the
happiness
of
which
i
have
deprived
but
remarked
monsieur
de
bourbonne
that
deed
constitutes
a
fraud
there
may
be
ground
for
a
then
birotteau
shall
go
to
the
law
if
he
loses
at
tours
he
may
win
at
orleans
if
he
loses
at
orleans
he
ll
win
in
paris
cried
the
baron
de
listomere
but
if
he
does
go
to
law
continued
monsieur
de
bourbonne
coldly
i
should
advise
him
to
resign
his
we
will
consult
lawyers
said
madame
de
listomere
and
go
to
law
if
law
is
best
but
this
affair
is
so
disgraceful
for
mademoiselle
gamard
and
is
likely
to
be
so
injurious
to
the
abbe
troubert
that
i
think
we
can
after
mature
deliberation
all
present
promised
their
assistance
to
the
abbe
birotteau
in
the
struggle
which
was
now
inevitable
between
the
poor
priest
and
his
antagonists
and
all
their
adherents
a
true
presentiment
an
infallible
provincial
instinct
led
them
to
couple
the
names
of
gamard
and
troubert
but
none
of
the
persons
assembled
on
this
occasion
in
madame
de
listomere
s
salon
except
the
old
fox
had
any
real
idea
of
the
nature
and
importance
of
such
a
struggle
monsieur
de
bourbonne
took
the
poor
abbe
aside
into
a
corner
of
the
room
of
the
fourteen
persons
now
present
he
said
in
a
low
voice
not
one
will
stand
by
you
a
fortnight
hence
if
the
time
comes
when
you
need
some
one
to
support
you
you
may
find
that
i
am
the
only
person
in
tours
bold
enough
to
take
up
your
defence
for
i
know
the
provinces
and
men
and
things
and
better
still
i
know
but
these
friends
of
yours
though
full
of
the
best
intentions
are
leading
you
astray
into
a
bad
path
from
which
you
won
t
be
able
to
extricate
yourself
take
my
advice
if
you
want
to
live
in
peace
resign
the
vicariat
of
and
leave
tours
don
t
say
where
you
are
going
but
find
some
distant
parish
where
troubert
can
not
get
hold
of
leave
tours
exclaimed
the
vicar
with
indescribable
terror
to
him
it
was
a
kind
of
death
the
tearing
up
of
all
the
roots
by
which
he
held
to
life
celibates
substitute
habits
for
feelings
and
when
to
that
moral
system
which
makes
them
pass
through
life
instead
of
really
living
it
is
added
a
feeble
character
external
things
assume
an
extraordinary
power
over
them
birotteau
was
like
certain
vegetables
transplant
them
and
you
stop
their
ripening
just
as
a
tree
needs
daily
the
same
sustenance
and
must
always
send
its
roots
into
the
same
soil
so
birotteau
needed
to
trot
about
and
amble
along
the
mail
where
he
took
his
daily
walk
and
saunter
through
the
streets
and
visit
the
three
salons
where
night
after
night
he
played
his
whist
or
his
backgammon
ah
i
did
not
think
of
it
replied
monsieur
de
bourbonne
gazing
at
the
priest
with
a
sort
of
pity
all
tours
was
soon
aware
that
madame
la
baronne
de
listomere
widow
of
a
had
invited
the
abbe
birotteau
vicar
of
to
stay
at
her
house
that
act
which
many
persons
questioned
presented
the
matter
sharply
and
divided
the
town
into
parties
especially
after
mademoiselle
salomon
spoke
openly
of
a
fraud
and
a
lawsuit
with
the
subtle
vanity
which
is
common
to
old
maids
and
the
fanatic
which
characterizes
them
mademoiselle
gamard
was
deeply
wounded
by
the
course
taken
by
madame
de
listomere
the
baroness
was
a
woman
of
high
rank
elegant
in
her
habits
and
ways
whose
good
taste
courteous
manners
and
true
piety
could
not
be
gainsaid
by
receiving
birotteau
as
her
guest
she
gave
a
formal
denial
to
all
mademoiselle
gamard
s
assertions
and
indirectly
censured
her
conduct
by
maintaining
the
vicar
s
cause
against
his
former
landlady
it
is
necessary
for
the
full
understanding
of
this
history
to
explain
how
the
natural
discernment
and
spirit
of
analysis
which
old
women
bring
to
bear
on
the
actions
of
others
gave
power
to
mademoiselle
gamard
and
what
were
the
resources
on
her
side
accompanied
by
the
taciturn
abbe
troubert
she
made
a
round
of
evening
visits
to
five
or
six
houses
at
each
of
which
she
met
a
circle
of
a
dozen
or
more
persons
united
by
kindred
tastes
and
the
same
general
situation
in
life
among
them
were
one
or
two
men
who
were
influenced
by
the
gossip
and
prejudices
of
their
servants
five
or
six
old
maids
who
spent
their
time
in
sifting
the
words
and
scrutinizing
the
actions
of
their
neighbours
and
others
in
the
class
below
them
besides
these
there
were
several
old
women
who
busied
themselves
in
retailing
scandal
keeping
an
exact
account
of
each
person
s
fortune
striving
to
control
or
influence
the
actions
of
others
prognosticating
marriages
and
blaming
the
conduct
of
friends
as
sharply
as
that
of
enemies
these
persons
spread
about
the
town
like
the
capillary
fibres
of
a
plant
sucked
in
with
the
thirst
of
a
leaf
for
the
dew
the
news
and
the
secrets
of
each
household
and
transmitted
them
mechanically
to
the
abbe
troubert
as
the
leaves
convey
to
the
branch
the
moisture
they
absorb
accordingly
during
every
evening
of
the
week
these
good
devotees
excited
by
that
need
of
emotion
which
exists
in
all
of
us
rendered
an
exact
account
of
the
current
condition
of
the
town
with
a
sagacity
worthy
of
the
council
of
ten
and
were
in
fact
a
species
of
police
armed
with
the
unerring
gift
of
spying
bestowed
by
passions
when
they
had
divined
the
secret
meaning
of
some
event
their
vanity
led
them
to
appropriate
to
themselves
the
wisdom
of
their
sanhedrim
and
set
the
tone
to
the
gossip
of
their
respective
spheres
this
idle
but
ever
busy
fraternity
invisible
yet
seeing
all
things
dumb
but
perpetually
talking
possessed
an
influence
which
its
nonentity
seemed
to
render
harmless
though
it
was
in
fact
terrible
in
its
effects
when
it
concerned
itself
with
serious
interests
for
a
long
time
nothing
had
entered
the
sphere
of
these
existences
so
serious
and
so
momentous
to
each
one
of
them
as
the
struggle
of
birotteau
supported
by
madame
de
listomere
against
mademoiselle
gamard
and
the
abbe
troubert
the
three
salons
of
madame
de
listomere
and
the
demoiselles
merlin
de
la
blottiere
and
de
villenoix
being
considered
as
enemies
by
all
the
salons
which
mademoiselle
gamard
frequented
there
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
quarrel
a
class
sentiment
with
all
its
jealousies
it
was
the
old
roman
struggle
of
people
and
senate
in
a
molehill
a
tempest
in
a
teacup
as
montesquieu
remarked
when
speaking
of
the
republic
of
san
marino
whose
public
offices
are
filled
by
the
day
only
despotic
power
being
easily
seized
by
any
citizen
but
this
tempest
petty
as
it
seems
did
develop
in
the
souls
of
these
persons
as
many
passions
as
would
have
been
called
forth
by
the
highest
social
interests
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
that
none
but
souls
concerned
in
mighty
projects
which
stir
their
lives
and
set
them
foaming
find
time
too
fleeting
the
hours
of
the
abbe
troubert
fled
by
as
eagerly
laden
with
thoughts
as
anxious
harassed
by
despairs
and
hopes
as
deep
as
the
cruellest
hours
of
the
gambler
the
lover
or
the
statesman
god
alone
is
in
the
secret
of
the
energy
we
expend
upon
our
occult
triumphs
over
man
over
things
over
ourselves
though
we
know
not
always
whither
we
are
going
we
know
well
what
the
journey
costs
us
if
it
be
permissible
for
the
historian
to
turn
aside
for
a
moment
from
the
drama
he
is
narrating
and
ask
his
readers
to
cast
a
glance
upon
the
lives
of
these
old
maids
and
abbes
and
seek
the
cause
of
the
evil
which
vitiates
them
at
their
source
we
may
find
it
demonstrated
that
man
must
experience
certain
passions
before
he
can
develop
within
him
those
virtues
which
give
grandeur
to
life
by
widening
his
sphere
and
checking
the
selfishness
which
is
inherent
in
every
created
being
madame
de
listomere
returned
to
town
without
being
aware
that
for
the
previous
week
her
friends
had
felt
obliged
to
refute
a
rumour
at
which
she
would
have
laughed
had
she
known
if
it
that
her
affection
for
her
nephew
had
an
almost
criminal
motive
she
took
birotteau
to
her
lawyer
who
did
not
regard
the
case
as
an
easy
one
the
vicar
s
friends
inspired
by
the
belief
that
justice
was
certain
in
so
good
a
cause
or
inclined
to
procrastinate
in
a
matter
which
did
not
concern
them
personally
had
put
off
bringing
the
suit
until
they
returned
to
tours
consequently
the
friends
of
mademoiselle
gamard
had
taken
the
initiative
and
told
the
affair
wherever
they
could
to
the
injury
of
birotteau
the
lawyer
whose
practice
was
exclusively
among
the
most
devout
church
people
amazed
madame
de
listomere
by
advising
her
not
to
embark
on
such
a
suit
he
ended
the
consultation
by
saying
that
he
himself
would
not
be
able
to
undertake
it
for
according
to
the
terms
of
the
deed
mademoiselle
gamard
had
the
law
on
her
side
and
in
equity
that
is
to
say
outside
of
strict
legal
justice
the
abbe
birotteau
would
undoubtedly
seem
to
the
judges
as
well
as
to
all
respectable
laymen
to
have
derogated
from
the
peaceable
conciliatory
and
mild
character
hitherto
attributed
to
him
that
mademoiselle
gamard
known
to
be
a
kindly
woman
and
easy
to
live
with
had
put
birotteau
under
obligations
to
her
by
lending
him
the
money
he
needed
to
pay
the
legacy
duties
on
chapeloud
s
bequest
without
taking
from
him
a
receipt
that
birotteau
was
not
of
an
age
or
character
to
sign
a
deed
without
knowing
what
it
contained
or
understanding
the
importance
of
it
that
in
leaving
mademoiselle
gamard
s
house
at
the
end
of
two
years
when
his
friend
chapeloud
had
lived
there
twelve
and
troubert
fifteen
he
must
have
had
some
purpose
known
to
himself
only
and
that
the
lawsuit
if
undertaken
would
strike
the
public
as
an
act
of
ingratitude
and
so
forth
letting
birotteau
go
before
them
to
the
staircase
the
lawyer
detained
madame
de
listomere
a
moment
to
entreat
her
if
she
valued
her
own
peace
of
mind
not
to
involve
herself
in
the
matter
but
that
evening
the
poor
vicar
suffering
the
torments
of
a
man
under
sentence
of
death
who
awaits
in
the
condemned
cell
at
bicetre
the
result
of
his
appeal
for
mercy
could
not
refrain
from
telling
his
assembled
friends
the
result
of
his
visit
to
the
lawyer
i
don
t
know
a
single
pettifogger
in
tours
said
monsieur
de
bourbonne
except
that
radical
lawyer
who
would
be
willing
to
take
the
case
unless
for
the
purpose
of
losing
it
i
don
t
advise
you
to
undertake
then
it
is
infamous
cried
the
navel
lieutenant
i
myself
will
take
the
abbe
to
the
radical
go
at
night
said
monsieur
de
bourbonne
interrupting
him
why
i
have
just
learned
that
the
abbe
troubert
is
appointed
in
place
of
the
other
man
who
died
i
don
t
care
a
fig
for
the
abbe
unfortunately
the
baron
de
listomere
a
man
years
of
age
did
not
see
the
sign
monsieur
de
bourbonne
made
him
to
be
cautious
in
what
he
said
motioning
as
he
did
so
to
a
friend
of
troubert
a
councillor
of
the
prefecture
who
was
present
the
lieutenant
therefore
continued
if
the
abbe
troubert
is
a
scoundrel
oh
said
monsieur
de
bourbonne
cutting
him
short
why
bring
monsieur
troubert
into
a
matter
which
doesn
t
concern
him
not
concern
him
cried
the
baron
isn
t
he
enjoying
the
use
of
the
abbe
birotteau
s
household
property
i
remember
that
when
i
called
on
the
abbe
chapeloud
i
noticed
two
valuable
pictures
say
that
they
are
worth
ten
thousand
francs
do
you
suppose
that
monsieur
birotteau
meant
to
give
ten
thousand
francs
for
living
two
years
with
that
gamard
woman
not
to
speak
of
the
library
and
furniture
which
are
worth
as
much
more
the
abbe
birotteau
opened
his
eyes
at
hearing
he
had
once
possessed
so
enormous
a
fortune
the
baron
getting
warmer
than
ever
went
on
to
say
by
jove
there
s
that
monsieur
salmon
formerly
an
expert
at
the
museum
in
paris
he
is
down
here
on
a
visit
to
his
i
ll
go
and
see
him
this
very
evening
with
the
abbe
birotteau
and
ask
him
to
look
at
those
pictures
and
estimate
their
value
from
there
i
ll
take
the
abbe
to
the
two
days
after
this
conversation
the
suit
was
begun
this
employment
of
the
liberal
laywer
did
harm
to
the
vicar
s
cause
those
who
were
opposed
to
the
government
and
all
who
were
known
to
dislike
the
priests
or
religion
two
things
quite
distinct
which
many
persons
confound
got
hold
of
the
affair
and
the
whole
town
talked
of
it
the
museum
expert
estimated
the
virgin
of
valentin
and
the
christ
of
lebrun
two
paintings
of
great
beauty
at
eleven
thousand
francs
as
to
the
bookshelves
and
the
gothic
furniture
the
taste
for
such
things
was
increasing
so
rapidly
in
paris
that
their
immediate
value
was
at
least
twelve
thousand
in
short
the
appraisal
of
the
whole
property
by
the
expert
reached
the
sum
of
over
thousand
francs
now
it
was
very
evident
that
birotteau
never
intended
to
give
mademoiselle
gamard
such
an
enormous
sum
of
money
for
the
small
amount
he
might
owe
her
under
the
terms
of
the
deed
therefore
he
had
legally
speaking
equitable
grounds
on
which
to
demand
an
amendment
of
the
agreement
if
this
were
denied
mademoiselle
gamard
was
plainly
guilty
of
intentional
fraud
the
radical
lawyer
accordingly
began
the
affair
by
serving
a
writ
on
mademoiselle
gamard
though
very
harsh
in
language
this
document
strengthened
by
citations
of
precedents
and
supported
by
certain
clauses
in
the
code
was
a
masterpiece
of
legal
argument
and
so
evidently
just
in
its
condemnation
of
the
old
maid
that
thirty
or
forty
copies
were
made
and
maliciously
distributed
through
the
town
iv
a
few
days
after
this
commencement
of
hostilities
between
birotteau
and
the
old
maid
the
baron
de
listomere
who
expected
to
be
included
as
captain
of
a
corvette
in
a
coming
promotion
lately
announced
by
the
minister
of
the
navy
received
a
letter
from
one
of
his
friends
warning
him
that
there
was
some
intention
of
putting
him
on
the
retired
list
greatly
astonished
by
this
information
he
started
for
paris
immediately
and
went
at
once
to
the
minister
who
seemed
to
be
amazed
himself
and
even
laughed
at
the
baron
s
fears
the
next
day
however
in
spite
of
the
minister
s
assurance
monsieur
de
listomere
made
inquiries
in
the
different
offices
by
an
indiscretion
often
practised
by
heads
of
departments
in
favor
of
their
friends
one
of
the
secretaries
showed
him
a
document
confirming
the
fatal
news
which
was
only
waiting
the
signature
of
the
director
who
was
ill
to
be
submitted
to
the
minister
the
baron
de
listomere
went
immediately
to
an
uncle
of
his
a
deputy
who
could
see
the
minister
of
the
navy
at
the
chamber
without
loss
of
time
and
begged
him
to
find
out
the
real
intentions
of
his
excellency
in
a
matter
which
threatened
the
loss
of
his
whole
future
he
waited
in
his
uncle
s
carriage
with
the
utmost
anxiety
for
the
end
of
the
session
his
uncle
came
out
before
the
chamber
rose
and
said
to
him
at
once
as
they
drove
away
why
the
devil
have
you
meddled
in
a
priest
s
quarrel
the
minister
began
by
telling
me
you
had
put
yourself
at
the
head
of
the
radicals
in
tours
that
your
political
opinions
were
objectionable
you
were
not
following
in
the
lines
of
the
government
with
other
remarks
as
much
involved
as
if
he
were
addressing
the
chamber
on
that
i
said
to
him
nonsense
let
us
come
to
the
the
end
was
that
his
excellency
told
me
frankly
you
were
in
bad
odor
with
the
diocese
in
short
i
made
a
few
inquiries
among
my
colleagues
and
i
find
that
you
have
been
talking
slightingly
of
a
certain
abbe
troubert
the
but
a
very
important
personage
in
the
province
where
he
represents
the
jesuits
i
have
made
myself
responsible
to
the
minister
for
your
future
conduct
my
good
nephew
if
you
want
to
make
your
way
be
careful
not
to
excite
ecclesiastical
enmities
go
at
once
to
tours
and
try
to
make
your
peace
with
that
devil
of
a
remember
that
such
priests
are
men
with
whom
we
absolutely
live
in
harmony
good
heavens
when
we
are
all
striving
and
working
to
religion
it
is
actually
stupid
in
a
lieutenant
who
wants
to
be
made
a
captain
to
affront
the
priests
if
you
don
t
make
up
matters
with
that
abbe
troubert
you
needn
t
count
on
me
i
shall
abandon
you
the
minister
of
ecclesiastical
affairs
told
me
just
now
that
troubert
was
certain
to
be
made
bishop
before
long
if
he
takes
a
dislike
to
our
family
he
could
hinder
me
from
being
included
in
the
next
batch
of
peers
don
t
you
understand
these
words
explained
to
the
naval
officer
the
nature
of
troubert
s
secret
occupations
about
which
birotteau
often
remarked
in
his
silly
way
i
can
t
think
what
he
does
with
himself
sitting
up
all
the
canon
s
position
in
the
midst
of
his
female
senate
converted
so
adroitly
into
provincial
detectives
and
his
personal
capacity
had
induced
the
congregation
of
jesus
to
select
him
out
of
all
the
ecclesiastics
in
the
town
as
the
secret
proconsul
of
touraine
archbishop
general
prefect
all
men
great
and
small
were
under
his
occult
dominion
the
baron
de
listomere
decided
at
once
on
his
course
i
shall
take
care
he
said
to
his
uncle
not
to
get
another
round
shot
below
my
three
days
after
this
diplomatic
conference
between
the
uncle
and
nephew
the
latter
returning
hurriedly
in
a
informed
his
aunt
the
very
night
of
his
arrival
of
the
dangers
the
family
were
running
if
they
persisted
in
supporting
that
fool
of
a
the
baron
had
detained
monsieur
de
bourbonne
as
the
old
gentleman
was
taking
his
hat
and
cane
after
the
usual
rubber
of
whist
the
of
that
sly
old
fox
seemed
indispensable
for
an
understanding
of
the
reefs
among
which
the
listomere
family
suddenly
found
themselves
and
perhaps
the
action
of
taking
his
hat
and
cane
was
only
a
ruse
to
have
it
whispered
in
his
ear
stay
after
the
others
we
want
to
talk
to
the
baron
s
sudden
return
his
apparent
satisfaction
which
was
quite
out
of
keeping
with
a
harassed
look
that
occasionally
crossed
his
face
informed
monsieur
de
bourbonne
vaguely
that
the
lieutenant
had
met
with
some
check
in
his
crusade
against
gamard
and
troubert
he
showed
no
surprise
when
the
baron
revealed
the
secret
power
of
the
jesuit
i
knew
that
he
said
then
why
cried
the
baroness
did
you
not
warn
us
madame
he
said
sharply
forget
that
i
was
aware
of
the
invisible
influence
of
that
priest
and
i
will
forget
that
you
knew
it
equally
well
if
we
do
not
keep
this
secret
now
we
shall
be
thought
his
accomplices
and
shall
be
more
feared
and
hated
than
we
are
do
as
i
do
pretend
to
be
duped
but
look
carefully
where
you
set
your
feet
i
did
warn
you
sufficiently
but
you
would
not
understand
me
and
i
did
not
choose
to
compromise
what
must
we
do
now
said
the
baron
the
abandonment
of
birotteau
was
not
even
made
a
question
it
was
a
first
condition
tacitly
accepted
by
the
three
deliberators
to
beat
a
retreat
with
the
honors
of
war
has
always
been
the
triumph
of
the
ablest
generals
replied
monsieur
de
bourbonne
bow
to
troubert
and
if
his
hatred
is
less
strong
than
his
vanity
you
will
make
him
your
ally
but
if
you
bow
too
low
he
will
walk
over
you
make
believe
that
you
intend
to
leave
the
service
and
you
ll
escape
him
monsieur
le
baron
send
away
birotteau
madame
and
you
will
set
things
right
with
mademoiselle
gamard
ask
the
abbe
troubert
when
you
meet
him
at
the
archbishop
s
if
he
can
play
whist
he
will
say
yes
then
invite
him
to
your
salon
where
he
wants
to
be
received
he
ll
be
sure
to
come
you
are
a
woman
and
you
can
certainly
win
a
priest
to
your
interests
when
the
baron
is
promoted
his
uncle
peer
of
france
and
troubert
a
bishop
you
can
make
birotteau
a
canon
if
you
choose
meantime
yield
but
yield
gracefully
all
the
while
with
a
slight
menace
your
family
can
give
troubert
quite
as
much
support
as
he
can
give
you
you
ll
understand
each
other
perfectly
on
that
score
as
for
you
sailor
carry
your
line
about
poor
birotteau
said
the
baroness
oh
get
rid
of
him
at
once
replied
the
old
man
as
he
rose
to
take
leave
if
some
clever
radical
lays
hold
of
that
empty
head
of
his
he
may
cause
you
much
trouble
after
all
the
court
would
certainly
give
a
verdict
in
his
favour
and
troubert
must
fear
that
he
may
forgive
you
for
beginning
the
struggle
but
if
they
were
defeated
he
would
be
implacable
i
have
said
my
he
snapped
his
put
on
his
overshoes
and
departed
the
next
day
after
breakfast
the
baroness
took
the
vicar
aside
and
said
to
him
not
without
visible
embarrassment
my
dear
monsieur
birotteau
you
will
think
what
i
am
about
to
ask
of
you
very
unjust
and
very
inconsistent
but
it
is
necessary
both
for
you
and
for
us
that
your
lawsuit
with
mademoiselle
gamard
be
withdrawn
by
resigning
your
claims
and
also
that
you
should
leave
my
as
he
heard
these
words
the
poor
abbe
turned
pale
i
am
she
continued
the
innocent
cause
of
your
misfortunes
and
moreover
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
nephew
you
would
never
have
begun
this
lawsuit
which
has
now
turned
to
your
injury
and
to
ours
but
listen
to
she
told
him
succinctly
the
immense
ramifications
of
the
affair
and
explained
the
serious
nature
of
its
consequences
her
own
meditations
during
the
night
had
told
her
something
of
the
probable
antecedents
of
troubert
s
life
she
was
able
without
misleading
birotteau
to
show
him
the
net
so
ably
woven
round
him
by
revenge
and
to
make
him
see
the
power
and
great
capacity
of
his
enemy
whose
hatred
to
chapeloud
under
whom
he
had
been
forced
to
crouch
for
a
dozen
years
now
found
vent
in
seizing
chapeloud
s
property
and
in
persecuting
chapeloud
in
the
person
of
his
friend
the
harmless
birotteau
clasped
his
hands
as
if
to
pray
and
wept
with
distress
at
the
sight
of
human
horrors
that
his
own
pure
soul
was
incapable
of
suspecting
as
frightened
as
though
he
had
suddenly
found
himself
at
the
edge
of
a
precipice
he
listened
with
fixed
moist
eyes
in
which
there
was
no
expression
to
the
revelations
of
his
friend
who
ended
by
saying
i
know
the
wrong
i
do
in
abandoning
your
cause
but
my
dear
abbe
family
duties
must
be
considered
before
those
of
friendship
yield
as
i
do
to
this
storm
and
i
will
prove
to
you
my
gratitude
i
am
not
talking
of
your
worldly
interests
for
those
i
take
charge
of
you
shall
be
made
free
of
all
such
anxieties
for
the
rest
of
your
life
by
means
of
monsieur
de
bourbonne
who
will
know
how
to
save
appearances
i
shall
arrange
matters
so
that
you
shall
lack
nothing
my
friend
grant
me
the
right
to
abandon
you
i
shall
ever
be
your
friend
though
forced
to
conform
to
the
axioms
of
the
world
you
must
the
poor
bewildered
abbe
cried
aloud
chapeloud
was
right
when
he
said
that
if
troubert
could
drag
him
by
the
feet
out
of
his
grave
he
would
do
it
he
sleeps
in
chapeloud
s
bed
there
is
no
use
in
lamenting
said
madame
de
listomere
and
we
have
little
time
now
left
to
us
how
will
you
decide
birotteau
was
too
good
and
kind
not
to
obey
in
a
great
crisis
the
unreflecting
impulse
of
the
moment
besides
his
life
was
already
in
the
agony
of
what
to
him
was
death
he
said
with
a
despairing
look
at
his
protectress
which
cut
her
to
the
heart
i
trust
myself
to
you
i
am
but
the
stubble
of
the
he
used
the
tourainean
word
bourrier
which
has
no
other
meaning
than
a
bit
of
but
there
are
pretty
little
straws
yellow
polished
and
shining
the
delight
of
children
whereas
the
bourrier
is
straw
discolored
muddy
sodden
in
the
puddles
whirled
by
the
tempest
crushed
under
feet
of
men
but
madame
i
can
not
let
the
abbe
troubert
keep
chapeloud
s
portrait
it
was
painted
for
me
it
belongs
to
me
obtain
that
for
me
and
i
will
give
up
all
the
well
said
madame
de
listomere
i
will
go
myself
to
mademoiselle
the
words
were
said
in
a
tone
which
plainly
showed
the
immense
effort
the
baronne
de
listomere
was
making
in
lowering
herself
to
flatter
the
pride
of
the
old
maid
i
will
see
what
can
be
done
she
said
i
hardly
dare
hope
anything
go
and
consult
monsieur
de
bourbonne
ask
him
to
put
your
renunciation
into
proper
form
and
bring
me
the
paper
i
will
see
the
archbishop
and
with
his
help
we
may
be
able
to
stop
the
matter
birotteau
left
the
house
dismayed
troubert
assumed
in
his
eyes
the
dimensions
of
an
egyptian
pyramid
the
hands
of
that
man
were
in
paris
his
elbows
in
the
cloister
of
he
said
the
victim
to
himself
to
prevent
the
baron
de
listomere
from
becoming
peer
of
france
and
perhaps
by
the
help
of
the
archbishop
we
may
be
able
to
stop
the
matter
here
in
presence
of
such
great
interests
birotteau
felt
he
was
a
mere
worm
he
judged
himself
harshly
the
news
of
birotteau
s
removal
from
madame
de
listomere
s
house
seemed
all
the
more
amazing
because
the
reason
of
it
was
wholly
impenetrable
madame
de
listomere
said
that
her
nephew
was
intending
to
marry
and
leave
the
navy
and
she
wanted
the
vicar
s
apartment
to
enlarge
her
own
birotteau
s
relinquishment
was
still
unknown
the
advice
of
monsieur
de
bourbonne
was
followed
whenever
the
two
facts
reached
the
ears
of
the
his
was
certain
to
be
gratified
by
the
assurance
they
gave
that
even
if
the
listomere
family
did
not
capitulate
they
would
at
least
remain
neutral
and
tacitly
recognize
the
occult
power
of
the
congregation
to
recognize
it
was
in
fact
to
submit
to
it
but
the
lawsuit
was
still
his
opponents
yielded
and
threatened
at
the
same
time
the
listomeres
had
thus
taken
precisely
the
same
attitude
as
the
himself
they
held
themselves
aloof
and
yet
were
able
to
direct
others
but
just
at
this
crisis
an
event
occurred
which
complicated
the
plans
laid
by
monsieur
de
bourbonne
and
the
listomeres
to
quiet
the
gamard
and
troubert
party
and
made
them
more
difficult
to
carry
out
mademoiselle
gamard
took
cold
one
evening
in
coming
out
of
the
cathedral
the
next
day
she
was
confined
to
her
bed
and
soon
after
became
dangerously
ill
the
whole
town
rang
with
pity
and
false
commiseration
mademoiselle
gamard
s
sensitive
nature
has
not
been
able
to
bear
the
scandal
of
this
lawsuit
in
spite
of
the
justice
of
her
cause
she
was
likely
to
die
of
grief
birotteau
has
killed
his
such
were
the
speeches
poured
through
the
capillary
tubes
of
the
great
female
conclave
and
taken
up
and
repeated
by
the
whole
town
of
tours
madame
de
listomere
went
the
day
after
mademoiselle
gamard
took
cold
to
pay
the
promised
visit
and
she
had
the
mortification
of
that
act
without
obtaining
any
benefit
from
it
for
the
old
maid
was
too
ill
to
see
her
she
then
asked
politely
to
speak
to
the
gratified
no
doubt
to
receive
in
chapeloud
s
library
at
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
above
which
hung
the
two
contested
pictures
the
woman
who
had
hitherto
ignored
him
troubert
kept
the
baroness
waiting
a
moment
before
he
consented
to
admit
her
no
courtier
and
no
diplomatist
ever
put
into
a
discussion
of
their
personal
interests
or
into
the
management
of
some
great
national
negotiation
more
shrewdness
dissimulation
and
ability
than
the
baroness
and
the
priest
displayed
when
they
met
face
to
face
for
the
struggle
like
the
seconds
or
sponsors
who
in
the
middle
age
armed
the
champion
and
strengthened
his
valor
by
useful
counsel
until
he
entered
the
lists
so
the
sly
old
fox
had
said
to
the
baroness
at
the
last
moment
don
t
forget
your
cue
you
are
a
mediator
and
not
an
interested
party
troubert
also
is
a
mediator
weigh
your
words
study
the
inflection
of
the
man
s
voice
if
he
strokes
his
chin
you
have
got
some
sketchers
are
fond
of
caricaturing
the
contrast
often
observable
between
what
is
said
and
what
is
thought
by
the
speaker
to
catch
the
full
meaning
of
the
duel
of
words
which
now
took
place
between
the
priest
and
the
lady
it
is
necessary
to
unveil
the
thoughts
that
each
hid
from
the
other
under
spoken
sentences
of
apparent
insignificance
madame
de
listomere
began
by
expressing
the
regret
she
had
felt
at
birotteau
s
lawsuit
and
then
went
on
to
speak
of
her
desire
to
settle
the
matter
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
parties
the
harm
is
done
madame
said
the
priest
in
a
grave
voice
the
pious
and
excellent
mademoiselle
gamard
is
i
don
t
care
a
fig
for
the
old
thing
thought
he
but
i
mean
to
put
her
death
on
your
shoulders
and
harass
your
conscience
if
you
are
such
a
fool
as
to
listen
to
on
hearing
of
her
illness
replied
the
baroness
i
entreated
monsieur
birotteau
to
relinquish
his
claims
i
have
brought
the
document
intending
to
give
it
to
that
excellent
i
see
what
you
mean
you
wily
scoundrel
thought
she
but
we
are
safe
now
from
your
calumnies
if
you
take
this
document
you
ll
cut
your
own
fingers
by
admitting
you
are
an
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
mademoiselle
gamard
s
temporal
affairs
do
not
concern
me
said
the
priest
at
last
lowering
the
large
lids
over
his
eagle
eyes
to
veil
his
emotions
ho
ho
thought
he
you
can
t
compromise
me
thank
god
those
damned
lawyers
won
t
dare
to
plead
any
cause
that
could
smirch
me
what
do
these
listomeres
expect
to
get
by
crouching
in
this
way
monsieur
replied
the
baroness
monsieur
birotteau
s
affairs
are
no
more
mine
than
those
of
mademoiselle
gamard
are
yours
but
unfortunately
religion
is
injured
by
such
a
quarrel
and
i
come
to
you
as
a
mediator
just
as
i
myself
am
seeking
to
make
we
are
not
deceiving
each
other
monsieur
troubert
thought
she
don
t
you
feel
the
sarcasm
of
that
answer
injury
to
religion
madame
exclaimed
the
religion
is
too
lofty
for
the
actions
of
men
to
my
religion
is
i
thought
he
god
makes
no
mistake
in
his
judgments
madame
i
recognize
no
tribunal
but
then
monsieur
she
replied
let
us
endeavor
to
bring
the
judgments
of
men
into
harmony
with
the
judgments
of
yes
indeed
your
religion
is
the
abbe
troubert
suddenly
changed
his
tone
your
nephew
has
been
to
paris
i
you
found
out
about
me
there
thought
he
you
know
now
that
i
can
crush
you
you
who
dared
to
slight
me
and
you
have
come
to
yes
monsieur
thank
you
for
the
interest
you
take
in
him
he
returns
the
minister
who
is
very
considerate
of
us
sent
for
him
he
does
not
want
monsieur
de
listomere
to
leave
the
jesuit
you
can
t
crush
us
thought
she
i
understand
your
a
moment
s
silence
i
did
not
think
my
nephew
s
conduct
in
this
affair
quite
the
thing
she
added
but
naval
men
must
be
excused
they
know
nothing
of
come
we
had
better
make
peace
thought
she
we
sha
n
t
gain
anything
by
battling
in
this
a
slight
smile
wandered
over
the
priests
face
and
was
lost
in
its
wrinkles
he
has
done
us
the
service
of
getting
a
proper
estimate
on
the
value
of
those
paintings
he
said
looking
up
at
the
pictures
they
will
be
a
noble
ornament
to
the
chapel
of
the
you
shot
a
sarcasm
at
me
thought
he
and
there
s
another
in
return
we
are
quits
if
you
intend
to
give
them
to
allow
me
to
offer
frames
that
will
be
more
suitable
and
worthy
of
the
place
and
of
the
works
i
wish
i
could
force
you
to
betray
that
you
have
taken
birotteau
s
things
for
your
own
thought
she
they
do
not
belong
to
me
said
the
priest
on
his
guard
here
is
the
deed
of
relinquishment
said
madame
de
listomere
it
ends
all
discussion
and
makes
them
over
to
mademoiselle
she
laid
the
document
on
the
table
see
the
confidence
i
place
in
you
thought
she
it
is
worthy
of
you
monsieur
she
added
worthy
of
your
noble
character
to
reconcile
two
christians
though
at
present
i
am
not
especially
concerned
for
monsieur
birotteau
he
is
living
in
your
house
said
troubert
interrupting
her
no
monsieur
he
is
no
longer
that
peerage
and
my
nephew
s
promotion
force
me
to
do
base
things
thought
she
the
priest
remained
impassible
but
his
calm
exterior
was
an
indication
of
violent
emotion
monsieur
bourbonne
alone
had
fathomed
the
secret
of
that
apparent
tranquillity
the
priest
had
triumphed
why
did
you
take
upon
yourself
to
bring
that
relinquishment
he
asked
with
a
feeling
analogous
to
that
which
impels
a
woman
to
fish
for
compliments
i
could
not
avoid
a
feeling
of
compassion
birotteau
whose
feeble
nature
must
be
well
known
to
you
entreated
me
to
see
madaemoiselle
gamard
and
to
obtain
as
the
price
of
his
renunciation
the
priest
frowned
of
rights
upheld
by
distinguished
lawyers
the
portrait
of
troubert
looked
fixedly
at
madame
de
listomere
the
portrait
of
chapeloud
she
said
continuing
i
leave
you
to
judge
of
his
you
will
be
certain
to
lose
your
case
if
we
go
to
law
and
you
know
it
thought
she
the
tone
of
her
voice
as
she
said
the
words
distinguished
lawyers
showed
the
priest
that
she
knew
very
well
both
the
strength
and
weakness
of
the
enemy
she
made
her
talent
so
plain
to
this
connoisseur
emeritus
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
which
lasted
a
long
time
in
the
tone
here
given
that
troubert
finally
went
down
to
mademoiselle
gamard
to
obtain
her
answer
to
birotteau
s
request
for
the
portrait
he
soon
returned
madame
he
said
i
bring
you
the
words
of
a
dying
woman
the
abbe
chapeloud
was
so
true
a
friend
to
me
she
said
that
i
can
not
consent
to
part
with
his
as
for
me
added
troubert
if
it
were
mine
i
would
not
yield
it
my
feelings
to
my
late
friend
were
so
faithful
that
i
should
feel
my
right
to
his
portrait
was
above
that
of
well
there
s
no
need
to
quarrel
over
a
bad
i
care
as
little
about
it
as
you
do
thought
she
keep
it
and
i
will
have
a
copy
made
of
it
i
take
some
credit
to
myself
for
having
averted
this
deplorable
lawsuit
and
i
have
gained
personally
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
i
hear
you
have
a
great
talent
for
whist
you
will
forgive
a
woman
for
curiosity
she
said
smiling
if
you
will
come
and
play
at
my
house
sometimes
you
can
not
doubt
your
troubert
stroked
his
chin
caught
bourbonne
was
right
thought
she
he
has
his
quantum
of
vanity
it
was
true
the
was
feeling
the
delightful
sensation
which
mirabeau
was
unable
to
subdue
when
in
the
days
of
his
power
he
found
gates
opening
to
his
carriage
which
were
barred
to
him
in
earlier
days
madame
he
replied
my
avocations
prevent
my
going
much
into
society
but
for
you
what
will
not
a
man
do
the
old
maid
is
going
to
die
i
ll
get
a
footing
at
the
listomere
s
and
serve
them
if
they
serve
me
thought
he
it
is
better
to
have
them
for
friends
than
madame
de
listomere
went
home
hoping
that
the
archbishop
would
complete
the
work
of
peace
so
auspiciously
begun
but
birotteau
was
fated
to
gain
nothing
by
his
relinquishment
mademoiselle
gamard
died
the
next
day
no
one
felt
surprised
when
her
will
was
opened
to
find
that
she
had
left
everything
to
the
abbe
troubert
her
fortune
was
appraised
at
three
hundred
thousand
francs
the
sent
to
madame
de
listomere
two
notes
of
invitation
for
the
services
and
for
the
funeral
procession
of
his
friend
one
for
herself
and
one
for
her
nephew
we
must
go
she
said
it
can
t
be
helped
said
monsieur
de
bourbonne
it
is
a
test
to
which
troubert
puts
you
baron
you
must
go
to
the
cemetery
he
added
turning
to
the
lieutenant
who
unluckily
for
him
had
not
left
tours
the
services
took
place
and
were
performed
with
unusual
ecclesiastical
magnificence
only
one
person
wept
and
that
was
birotteau
who
kneeling
in
a
side
chapel
and
seen
by
none
believed
himself
guilty
of
the
death
and
prayed
sincerely
for
the
soul
of
the
deceased
bitterly
deploring
that
he
was
not
able
to
obtain
her
forgiveness
before
she
died
the
abbe
troubert
followed
the
body
of
his
friend
to
the
grave
at
the
verge
of
which
he
delivered
a
discourse
in
which
thanks
to
his
eloquence
the
narrow
life
the
old
maid
had
lived
was
enlarged
to
monumental
proportions
those
present
took
particular
note
of
the
following
words
in
the
peroration
this
life
of
days
devoted
to
god
and
to
his
religion
a
life
adorned
with
noble
actions
silently
performed
and
with
modest
and
hidden
virtues
was
crushed
by
a
sorrow
which
we
might
call
undeserved
if
we
could
forget
here
at
the
verge
of
this
grave
that
our
afflictions
are
sent
by
god
the
numerous
friends
of
this
saintly
woman
knowing
the
innocence
and
nobility
of
her
soul
foresaw
that
she
would
issue
safely
from
her
trials
in
spite
of
the
accusations
which
blasted
her
life
it
may
be
that
providence
has
called
her
to
the
bosom
of
god
to
withdraw
her
from
those
trials
happy
they
who
can
rest
here
below
in
the
peace
of
their
own
hearts
as
sophie
now
is
resting
in
her
robe
of
innocence
among
the
when
he
had
ended
his
pompous
discourse
said
monsieur
de
bourbonne
after
relating
the
incidents
of
the
internment
to
madame
de
listomere
when
whist
was
over
the
doors
shut
and
they
were
alone
with
the
baron
this
louis
xi
in
a
cassock
imagine
him
if
you
can
gave
a
last
flourish
to
the
sprinkler
and
aspersed
the
coffin
with
holy
monsieur
de
bourbonne
picked
up
the
tongs
and
imitated
the
priest
s
gesture
so
satirically
that
the
baron
and
his
aunt
could
not
help
laughing
not
until
then
continued
the
old
gentleman
did
he
contradict
himself
up
to
that
time
his
behavior
had
been
perfect
but
it
was
no
doubt
impossible
for
him
to
put
the
old
maid
whom
he
despised
so
heartily
and
hated
almost
as
much
as
he
hated
chapeloud
out
of
sight
forever
without
allowing
his
joy
to
appear
in
that
last
the
next
day
mademoiselle
salomon
came
to
breakfast
with
madame
de
listomere
chiefly
to
say
with
deep
emotion
our
poor
abbe
birotteau
has
just
received
a
frightful
blow
which
shows
the
most
determined
hatred
he
is
appointed
curate
of
is
a
suburb
of
tours
lying
beyond
the
bridge
that
bridge
one
of
the
finest
monuments
of
french
architecture
is
nineteen
hundred
feet
long
and
the
two
open
squares
which
surround
each
end
are
precisely
alike
don
t
you
see
the
misery
of
it
she
said
after
a
pause
amazed
at
the
coldness
with
which
madame
de
listomere
received
the
news
it
is
just
as
if
the
abbe
were
a
hundred
miles
from
tours
from
his
friends
from
everything
it
is
a
frightful
exile
and
all
the
more
cruel
because
he
is
kept
within
sight
of
the
town
where
he
can
hardly
ever
come
since
his
troubles
he
walks
very
feebly
yet
he
will
have
to
walk
three
miles
to
see
his
old
friends
he
has
taken
to
his
bed
just
now
with
fever
the
parsonage
at
is
very
cold
and
damp
and
the
parish
is
too
poor
to
repair
it
the
poor
old
man
will
be
buried
in
a
living
tomb
oh
it
is
an
infamous
plot
to
end
this
history
it
will
suffice
to
relate
a
few
events
in
a
simple
way
and
to
give
one
last
picture
of
its
chief
personages
five
months
later
the
was
made
bishop
of
troyes
and
madame
de
listomere
was
dead
leaving
an
annuity
of
fifteen
hundred
francs
to
the
abbe
birotteau
the
day
on
which
the
dispositions
in
her
will
were
made
known
monseigneur
hyacinthe
bishop
of
troyes
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
tours
to
reside
in
his
diocese
but
he
delayed
his
departure
on
receiving
the
news
furious
at
being
foiled
by
a
woman
to
whom
he
had
lately
given
his
countenance
while
she
had
been
secretly
holding
the
hand
of
a
man
whom
he
regarded
as
his
enemy
troubert
again
threatened
the
baron
s
future
career
and
put
in
jeopardy
the
peerage
of
his
uncle
he
made
in
the
salon
of
the
archbishop
and
before
an
assembled
party
one
of
those
priestly
speeches
which
are
big
with
vengeance
and
soft
with
honied
mildness
the
baron
de
listomere
went
the
next
day
to
see
this
implacable
enemy
who
must
have
imposed
sundry
hard
conditions
on
him
for
the
baron
s
subsequent
conduct
showed
the
most
entire
submission
to
the
will
of
the
terrible
jesuit
the
new
bishop
made
over
mademoiselle
gamard
s
house
by
deed
of
gift
to
the
chapter
of
the
cathedral
he
gave
chapeloud
s
books
and
bookcases
to
the
seminary
he
presented
the
two
disputed
pictures
to
the
chapel
of
the
virgin
but
he
kept
chapeloud
s
portrait
no
one
knew
how
to
explain
this
almost
total
renunciation
of
mademoiselle
gamard
s
bequest
monsieur
de
bourbonne
supposed
that
the
bishop
had
secretly
kept
moneys
that
were
invested
so
as
to
support
his
rank
with
dignity
in
paris
where
of
course
he
would
take
his
seat
on
the
bishops
bench
in
the
upper
chamber
it
was
not
until
the
night
before
monseigneur
troubert
s
departure
from
tours
that
the
sly
old
fox
unearthed
the
hidden
reason
of
this
strange
action
the
deathblow
given
by
the
most
persistent
vengeance
to
the
feeblest
of
victims
madame
de
listomere
s
legacy
to
birotteau
was
contested
by
the
baron
de
listomere
under
a
pretence
of
undue
influence
a
few
days
after
the
case
was
brought
the
baron
was
promoted
to
the
rank
of
captain
as
a
measure
of
ecclesiastical
discipline
the
curate
of
was
suspended
his
superiors
judged
him
guilty
the
murderer
of
sophie
gamard
was
also
a
swindler
if
monseigneur
troubert
had
kept
mademoiselle
gamard
s
property
he
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
make
the
ecclestiastical
authorities
censure
birotteau
at
the
moment
when
monseigneur
hyacinthe
bishop
of
troyes
drove
along
the
quay
in
a
on
his
way
to
paris
poor
birotteau
had
been
placed
in
an
armchair
in
the
sun
on
a
terrace
above
the
road
the
unhappy
priest
smitten
by
the
archbishop
was
pale
and
haggard
grief
stamped
on
every
feature
distorted
the
face
that
was
once
so
mildly
gay
illness
had
dimmed
his
eyes
formerly
brightened
by
the
pleasures
of
good
living
and
devoid
of
serious
ideas
with
a
veil
which
simulated
thought
it
was
but
the
skeleton
of
the
old
birotteau
who
had
rolled
only
one
year
earlier
so
vacuous
but
so
content
along
the
cloister
the
bishop
cast
one
look
of
pity
and
contempt
upon
his
victim
then
he
consented
to
forget
him
and
went
his
way
there
is
no
doubt
that
troubert
would
have
been
in
other
times
a
hildebrand
or
an
alexander
the
sixth
in
these
days
the
church
is
no
longer
a
political
power
and
does
not
absorb
the
whole
strength
of
her
solitaries
celibacy
however
presents
the
inherent
vice
of
concentrating
the
faculties
of
man
upon
a
single
passion
egotism
which
renders
celibates
either
useless
or
mischievous
we
live
at
a
period
when
the
defect
of
governments
is
to
make
man
for
society
rather
than
society
for
man
there
is
a
perpetual
struggle
going
on
between
the
individual
and
the
social
system
which
insists
on
using
him
while
he
is
endeavoring
to
use
it
to
his
own
profit
whereas
in
former
days
man
really
more
free
was
also
more
loyal
to
the
public
weal
the
round
in
which
men
struggle
in
these
days
has
been
insensibly
widened
the
soul
which
can
grasp
it
as
a
whole
will
ever
be
a
magnificent
exception
for
as
a
general
thing
in
morals
as
in
physics
impulsion
loses
in
intensity
what
it
gains
in
extension
society
can
not
be
based
on
exceptions
man
in
the
first
instance
was
purely
and
simply
father
his
heart
beat
warmly
concentrated
in
the
one
ray
of
family
later
he
lived
for
a
clan
or
a
small
community
hence
the
great
historical
devotions
of
greece
and
rome
after
that
he
was
a
man
of
caste
or
of
a
religion
to
maintain
the
greatness
of
which
he
often
proved
himself
sublime
but
by
that
time
the
field
of
his
interests
became
enlarged
by
many
intellectual
regions
in
our
day
his
life
is
attached
to
that
of
a
vast
country
sooner
or
later
his
family
will
be
it
is
predicted
the
entire
universe
will
this
moral
cosmopolitanism
the
hope
of
christian
rome
prove
to
be
only
a
sublime
error
it
is
so
natural
to
believe
in
the
realization
of
a
noble
vision
in
the
brotherhood
of
man
but
alas
the
human
machine
does
not
have
such
divine
proportions
souls
that
are
vast
enough
to
grasp
a
range
of
feelings
bestowed
on
great
men
only
will
never
belong
to
either
fathers
of
families
or
simple
citizens
some
physiologists
have
thought
that
as
the
brain
enlarges
the
heart
narrows
but
they
are
mistaken
the
apparent
egotism
of
men
who
bear
a
science
a
nation
a
code
of
laws
in
their
bosom
is
the
noblest
of
passions
it
is
as
one
may
say
the
maternity
of
the
masses
to
give
birth
to
new
peoples
to
produce
new
ideas
they
must
unite
within
their
mighty
brains
the
breasts
of
woman
and
the
force
of
god
the
history
of
such
men
as
innocent
the
third
and
peter
the
great
and
all
great
leaders
of
their
age
and
nation
will
show
if
need
be
in
the
highest
spheres
the
same
vast
thought
of
which
troubert
was
made
the
