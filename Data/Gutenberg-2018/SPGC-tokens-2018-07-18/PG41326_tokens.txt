preparing
for
the
young
débutantes
eileen
marjorie
and
letitia
chetwynd
were
expected
home
from
school
it
was
a
bright
day
early
in
april
and
chetwynd
was
seated
in
her
luxurious
london
conversing
with
her
special
friend
acheson
two
years
ago
chetwynd
on
the
death
of
her
husband
a
distinguished
indian
officer
had
returned
to
england
she
was
a
fashionable
lady
now
her
widow
s
dress
was
carefully
too
depressing
but
all
that
was
correct
and
proper
acheson
also
the
widow
of
an
indian
officer
was
not
fashionable
in
the
ordinary
acceptance
of
the
word
she
was
plainly
even
shabbily
dressed
she
wore
long
weepers
to
her
widow
s
cap
and
her
hair
was
brushed
smoothly
away
from
her
broad
forehead
her
face
was
large
and
somewhat
sunburnt
her
hands
well
shaped
but
with
a
look
about
them
which
showed
that
they
were
not
unacquainted
with
manual
labor
yes
said
chetwynd
uttering
a
sigh
as
she
spoke
this
is
a
great
day
for
me
the
girls
are
educated
and
are
coming
for
good
said
acheson
well
yes
my
dear
i
suppose
so
you
see
they
are
all
eighteen
it
is
absurd
to
keep
girls
at
school
after
eighteen
they
were
eighteen
the
end
of
last
year
in
these
days
when
people
grow
old
so
terribly
fast
girls
ought
to
have
their
education
finished
at
my
dear
belle
would
not
agree
with
you
said
acheson
chetwynd
threw
up
her
hands
and
slightly
raised
her
arched
brows
spare
me
dear
emily
she
cried
i
do
not
want
to
hear
any
of
your
dear
extraordinary
clever
belle
s
theories
at
present
i
sincerely
my
dear
i
must
be
sincerely
trust
the
wave
of
her
influence
will
never
come
into
my
acheson
sighed
and
sank
back
in
her
chair
on
the
whole
she
said
i
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
i
have
enough
to
live
on
and
the
memory
of
my
dear
husband
s
brilliant
career
will
always
be
a
comfort
to
me
belle
is
also
in
excellent
health
she
is
of
course
one
of
the
great
admirations
of
my
life
but
i
will
admit
it
dear
in
a
whisper
that
she
is
also
one
of
my
trials
but
dear
helen
i
had
forgotten
that
you
had
three
daughters
and
how
can
they
be
all
eighteen
at
the
same
time
i
have
not
three
daughters
my
dear
i
have
only
two
letitia
is
not
my
daughter
she
is
my
niece
she
is
my
dear
husband
s
younger
brother
s
child
she
happens
to
have
been
born
within
a
month
of
eileen
and
marjorie
who
are
twins
consequently
the
three
are
practically
the
same
age
they
will
be
home
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
they
are
all
devoted
to
each
other
but
i
confess
it
will
be
something
of
a
handful
taking
three
into
society
at
the
same
oh
you
surely
don
t
mean
to
introduce
the
whole
three
the
same
season
said
acheson
how
can
you
contemplate
anything
so
appalling
but
i
do
contemplate
it
said
chetwynd
and
i
believe
i
shall
manage
very
well
i
have
been
of
course
in
close
correspondence
with
their
invaluable
teacher
marchland
and
have
had
frequent
photographs
of
the
children
eileen
and
marjorie
are
alike
in
appearance
and
strikingly
handsome
they
will
be
foils
to
letitia
who
is
as
fair
as
they
are
dark
letitia
is
pretty
and
fascinating
of
the
petit
order
i
should
think
the
three
would
make
something
of
a
sensation
you
see
my
dear
i
have
large
means
for
my
husband
came
in
for
the
property
of
his
elder
brother
who
died
six
months
before
him
i
can
do
well
by
the
children
and
i
mean
to
do
you
contemplate
matrimony
as
the
aim
and
object
of
your
ambition
said
acheson
nothing
of
the
kind
replied
chetwynd
slightly
reddening
if
it
comes
well
and
good
if
a
really
estimable
worthy
man
takes
a
fancy
to
any
of
my
girls
and
his
affection
is
returned
i
shall
look
upon
marriage
as
a
suitable
life
for
my
children
but
i
do
not
take
them
into
society
for
the
sole
purpose
of
getting
acheson
slowly
shook
her
head
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
make
people
believe
that
she
said
in
all
probability
the
three
girls
will
marry
continued
chetwynd
in
her
calm
even
voice
which
seldom
rose
to
excitement
or
dropped
to
melancholy
marriage
is
what
providence
intends
for
all
happy
women
early
marriage
and
happy
homes
of
their
own
but
i
shall
not
hurry
the
matter
nor
put
myself
out
about
it
i
mean
the
girls
to
have
a
good
time
and
will
leave
other
matters
to
taking
steps
meanwhile
to
accomplish
your
real
object
murmured
acheson
under
her
breath
my
dear
emily
do
tell
me
about
your
belle
continued
chetwynd
so
you
have
really
sent
her
to
wode
s
college
yes
and
she
is
very
happy
there
and
hopes
to
do
well
in
her
i
must
frankly
say
that
i
hate
girls
colleges
said
chetwynd
after
all
these
ideas
that
women
have
taken
hold
of
are
most
disastrous
what
awful
creatures
one
meets
now
and
then
all
womanliness
extracted
out
of
walking
intellects
with
no
hearts
of
any
you
really
do
run
to
the
fair
with
the
thing
replied
acheson
i
am
sure
my
dear
but
chetwynd
did
not
want
to
hear
about
dear
belle
just
at
that
moment
there
came
a
welcome
interruption
in
the
shape
of
tea
it
was
placed
on
a
small
table
in
front
of
the
hostess
who
poured
it
out
helped
her
friend
to
rich
cream
and
offered
her
hot
buttered
cake
acheson
could
only
manage
plain
teas
at
home
and
she
enjoyed
her
friend
s
meals
she
was
fond
of
saying
all
the
more
by
contrast
i
shall
long
to
hear
of
your
dear
girls
and
also
to
see
them
she
said
as
she
sipped
her
tea
and
stirred
it
slowly
with
a
small
russian
spoon
well
come
over
and
take
a
peep
at
them
on
saturday
said
chetwynd
belle
is
away
is
she
not
she
comes
home
night
she
has
had
a
very
pleasant
tour
in
switzerland
may
i
bring
her
with
me
chetwynd
longed
to
say
she
disliked
belle
acheson
she
disliked
her
manners
and
her
mode
of
life
and
she
did
not
wish
her
to
exercise
the
smallest
influence
over
letitia
eileen
and
marjorie
after
a
moment
s
reflection
however
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
these
young
ladies
could
not
be
injured
by
any
one
so
plain
and
unimportant
she
therefore
bent
her
head
in
token
of
willingness
to
receive
belle
acheson
for
a
few
hours
into
her
house
let
it
be
saturday
then
she
said
come
as
early
as
you
can
in
the
afternoon
if
all
goes
well
i
mean
to
have
my
three
girls
presented
this
season
i
took
this
house
for
the
purpose
it
is
in
a
fashionable
locality
and
close
to
everything
yes
after
all
three
young
débutantes
will
in
one
sense
be
an
advantage
the
thing
will
be
out
of
the
common
nothing
is
admired
so
much
as
the
uncommon
i
expect
i
shall
enjoy
myself
and
the
girls
whatever
happens
shall
have
a
good
time
if
you
are
wise
my
dear
emily
you
will
try
to
introduce
belle
if
you
dress
her
well
you
might
do
wonders
with
her
belle
in
society
said
acheson
with
a
laugh
ah
i
see
you
do
not
know
her
yet
expect
me
on
saturday
and
i
will
bring
belle
if
i
chetwynd
heaved
a
sigh
as
her
friend
left
the
room
chapter
ii
in
a
carriage
three
girls
were
traveling
in
a
carriage
to
king
s
cross
the
train
was
not
an
express
it
stopped
at
nearly
every
station
the
carriage
in
which
they
sat
was
more
or
less
crowded
with
country
people
who
carried
baskets
babies
and
all
sorts
of
parcels
the
girls
looking
bright
and
energetic
occupied
corner
seats
a
woman
with
a
fretful
baby
on
her
knee
sat
near
one
how
tired
you
must
be
said
this
girl
do
let
me
hold
your
baby
for
a
as
she
spoke
all
the
other
passengers
turned
and
stared
at
her
she
was
a
tall
slim
very
girl
her
serge
dress
lacked
freshness
her
sailor
hat
was
decidedly
the
worse
for
wear
and
her
gloves
had
been
mended
in
many
places
the
woman
whom
the
girl
addressed
glancing
first
at
the
shabby
clothes
then
at
the
kind
bright
handsome
young
face
decided
that
the
girl
was
not
very
much
above
herself
in
the
social
scale
and
agreed
to
let
her
hold
her
baby
for
a
bit
a
charming
color
came
into
the
girl
s
face
as
she
received
the
small
atom
of
humanity
on
her
knee
she
held
the
baby
tenderly
her
young
arms
were
strong
the
little
one
nestled
down
comfortably
and
the
mother
gave
her
a
glance
of
admiration
why
i
do
declare
my
dear
she
exclaimed
one
would
think
you
had
of
your
own
you
handle
the
little
mite
that
knowingly
oh
it
is
because
i
love
children
replied
the
girl
it
is
kind
of
you
to
let
me
hold
your
little
one
look
marjorie
do
look
hasn
t
it
pretty
little
fingers
and
oh
do
see
its
tiny
toes
another
tall
girl
bent
forward
and
began
to
examine
the
baby
s
feet
they
were
pink
and
very
small
the
girl
stretched
out
her
palm
and
the
other
girl
placed
the
little
foot
upon
it
you
are
not
to
take
the
little
dear
from
me
said
the
first
girl
oh
my
dear
eileen
i
would
not
deprive
you
of
the
little
treasure
for
the
world
was
the
quick
reply
i
know
by
your
face
you
are
in
the
seventh
i
am
i
am
replied
the
girl
addressed
as
eileen
oh
what
a
darling
it
is
so
delicious
marjorie
when
it
nestles
up
against
the
train
slackened
speed
drew
up
at
a
great
station
and
the
woman
the
baby
and
most
of
the
other
passengers
got
out
the
three
girls
now
found
themselves
alone
in
the
carriage
the
girl
at
the
distant
window
the
smallest
of
the
three
turned
and
eagerly
faced
her
companions
well
eileen
she
shook
her
finger
in
the
face
of
the
bright
tall
girl
as
she
if
you
begin
that
sort
of
thing
just
on
the
very
day
when
you
have
left
school
if
you
will
insist
on
wearing
those
disgracefully
shabby
clothes
going
and
taking
us
with
you
when
your
mother
sends
us
money
to
travel
first
and
finally
adopting
strange
babies
who
happen
to
be
traveling
in
the
same
carriage
you
will
certainly
break
aunt
helen
s
eileen
shrugged
her
shoulders
not
at
all
she
answered
mother
may
not
like
it
at
first
but
she
will
soon
learn
to
know
once
for
all
that
marjorie
and
i
mean
to
follow
our
own
bent
marjorie
and
i
do
not
intend
to
wear
gay
clothes
because
we
consider
finery
a
sheer
waste
of
money
but
as
to
you
lettie
it
is
the
greatest
pity
you
are
not
mother
s
own
daughter
how
exquisitely
neat
how
smart
you
look
not
smart
at
all
only
suitably
dressed
replied
letitia
bridling
a
little
she
was
wearing
a
very
correct
traveling
costume
of
dark
gray
her
bright
wavy
hair
was
arranged
in
the
latest
and
most
fashionable
manner
little
curls
and
bits
of
fluffy
downy
brightness
would
get
out
of
their
confinement
and
dance
round
her
small
soft
face
she
was
wearing
the
universal
coat
and
skirt
but
a
cambric
shirt
and
a
white
sailor
hat
with
a
broad
white
ribbon
gave
distinction
to
her
costume
her
gloves
were
also
white
and
her
little
shoes
had
smart
bows
and
buckles
my
dress
is
only
suitable
she
repeated
now
your
dress
eileen
is
not
suitable
nor
is
yours
marjorie
to
wear
what
is
not
suitable
is
the
height
of
oh
do
listen
to
her
said
marjorie
bursting
into
a
hearty
laugh
she
is
trying
to
scare
us
with
those
old
bogy
words
as
if
we
minded
think
what
it
all
means
lettie
before
you
condemn
us
so
severely
mother
s
money
is
safe
in
my
purse
instead
of
on
my
person
and
the
difference
between
third
and
first
class
means
a
considerable
addition
also
to
my
nice
heavy
little
purse
who
knows
in
what
class
we
are
coming
up
to
town
who
cares
to
know
mother
is
certain
not
to
meet
us
at
king
s
cross
and
old
fowler
will
not
see
what
class
we
alight
i
am
glad
aunt
helen
has
secured
fowler
as
her
coachman
said
letitia
but
all
the
same
she
added
hastily
you
both
do
look
disgracefully
well
lettie
said
marjorie
i
don
t
feel
shabby
which
is
the
main
thing
what
can
be
the
matter
with
this
serviceable
dress
it
is
very
strong
and
won
t
tear
and
is
the
sort
which
does
not
crumple
it
is
all
over
grease
replied
letitia
spots
of
grease
here
there
and
everywhere
and
oh
your
is
absolutely
a
hole
in
the
thumb
of
the
one
on
your
left
hand
it
is
too
disgraceful
my
gloves
suit
my
character
replied
marjorie
she
looked
at
her
sister
they
both
sat
back
in
their
seats
and
indulged
in
hearty
girlish
laughter
they
were
very
like
one
another
the
same
dark
handsome
eyes
beamed
out
of
each
face
the
same
good
arched
brows
the
same
hair
thick
and
straight
very
dark
in
color
but
cropped
to
within
an
inch
of
their
respective
heads
they
had
clear
good
complexions
plenty
of
color
brightened
each
pair
of
healthy
lips
were
beautifully
formed
and
they
had
pearly
teeth
and
yet
these
two
girls
partly
because
of
their
dress
were
not
looked
at
twice
during
that
journey
whereas
letitia
was
the
cynosure
of
many
admiring
eyes
chapter
iii
the
torn
dress
king
s
cross
was
reached
without
adventure
and
a
moment
later
marjorie
was
eagerly
talking
to
old
fowler
the
coachman
how
are
you
fowler
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
again
she
cried
she
held
out
her
hand
to
the
old
coachman
as
she
spoke
i
am
quite
well
i
thank
you
miss
he
replied
he
could
not
help
smiling
into
the
beaming
dark
eyes
and
could
not
help
thinking
notwithstanding
a
certain
amount
of
chagrin
how
nice
it
was
to
have
miss
marjorie
back
from
school
eileen
and
i
have
knitted
some
baby
socks
for
the
last
addition
to
your
family
fowler
continued
marjorie
we
ll
come
round
and
see
fowler
and
the
bairns
how
old
is
the
last
baby
and
is
it
dark
or
fair
it
s
six
weeks
old
miss
and
very
dark
but
the
wife
isn
t
as
strong
as
she
ought
to
fowler
colored
all
over
his
face
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
porter
standing
near
listening
to
this
conversation
perhaps
young
ladies
said
the
footman
coming
to
the
rescue
you
wouldn
t
mind
getting
into
the
carriage
for
the
horses
are
that
fresh
fowler
can
scarcely
keep
em
standing
much
but
it
s
quite
serious
about
his
wife
not
being
strong
said
eileen
in
a
meditative
voice
now
if
she
were
to
take
extract
of
malt
or
fellowes
oh
do
get
into
the
carriage
cried
letitia
really
eileen
you
will
be
one
of
the
most
remarkable
women
of
your
day
if
you
keep
up
your
present
fads
can
t
you
see
how
all
those
porters
are
enjoying
the
scene
and
as
to
poor
wretched
fowler
if
you
think
he
enjoys
talking
about
his
latest
baby
and
the
medicines
his
wife
is
to
take
at
king
s
cross
station
you
are
vastly
mistaken
for
goodness
sake
get
as
letitia
spoke
she
gave
her
energetic
cousin
a
push
eileen
scrambled
into
the
carriage
almost
headforemost
treading
on
her
dress
and
tearing
a
piece
of
braid
as
she
did
so
marjorie
followed
suit
and
letitia
entered
last
in
a
dainty
and
pretty
manner
the
footman
shut
the
door
and
got
on
the
box
beside
the
coachman
poor
fowler
s
ears
were
still
red
from
the
questions
which
eileen
had
plied
him
with
bless
her
eart
he
exclaimed
to
the
footman
she
don
t
know
that
it
s
rather
awkward
to
talk
about
the
wife
and
bairns
at
a
place
like
king
s
cross
but
she
s
the
young
lady
that
ever
walked
i
knew
her
when
she
was
a
little
all
the
same
you
looked
like
a
fool
when
she
questioned
you
replied
hopkins
and
i
doubt
much
if
the
missus
will
allow
her
young
ladies
to
go
you
in
fox
well
all
i
can
say
is
this
replied
the
coachman
if
miss
eileen
and
miss
marjorie
are
like
what
they
used
to
be
when
they
was
young
i
don
t
think
the
missus
will
be
able
to
prevent
them
having
their
own
he
whipped
up
his
horses
as
he
spoke
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
girls
had
reached
home
chetwynd
was
standing
in
the
hall
to
welcome
them
my
darlings
here
you
are
at
last
she
cried
oh
good
gracious
eileen
take
care
where
you
are
going
see
that
great
piece
of
braid
trailing
in
front
of
your
dress
my
dear
child
you
will
be
on
your
oh
never
mind
mother
said
eileen
i
m
quite
accustomed
to
this
sort
of
have
you
a
penknife
i
ll
cut
it
cut
it
off
cried
chetwynd
nothing
of
the
kind
i
wonder
where
your
maid
is
here
she
turned
to
the
footman
who
was
standing
motionless
in
the
hall
go
thomas
and
desire
esther
to
come
down
will
mend
your
braid
my
dear
eileen
well
lettie
dear
and
how
are
you
quite
well
thank
you
aunt
helen
replied
letitia
in
her
correct
ladylike
voice
i
think
marjorie
and
eileen
are
a
little
overexcited
at
getting
home
and
if
you
will
pray
mother
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
eileen
we
are
not
a
bit
ashamed
of
our
dresses
we
do
not
intend
to
waste
money
upon
raiment
having
sufficient
clothes
to
cover
ourselves
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
my
idea
is
to
have
one
warm
dress
for
the
winter
and
one
cool
one
for
the
summer
and
no
more
a
felt
hat
for
winter
and
a
sailor
one
for
summer
and
no
more
when
the
dresses
are
completely
worn
out
they
can
be
given
to
the
may
or
may
not
make
something
of
we
can
buy
a
couple
of
new
ones
you
are
going
to
give
us
an
allowance
aren
t
you
mother
we
will
talk
of
that
presently
my
dears
remember
my
dear
children
i
have
not
seen
you
for
a
year
i
had
a
delightful
time
on
the
continent
but
i
never
forgot
you
my
loves
but
now
that
you
have
come
home
for
good
there
will
be
much
to
talk
over
and
arrange
meantime
we
can
surely
let
the
subject
of
dress
but
dear
mother
did
you
say
we
had
come
home
for
good
cried
marjorie
you
surely
don
t
suppose
that
our
education
is
finished
we
are
only
just
we
will
talk
of
that
also
by
and
by
replied
chetwynd
a
frown
knitting
her
brows
and
her
heart
sinking
a
trifle
marjorie
and
eileen
had
always
been
wayward
children
difficult
to
manage
and
but
with
a
certain
stubborn
element
about
them
which
caused
them
not
to
disobey
but
to
have
their
desires
on
almost
every
point
gratified
simply
because
the
trouble
of
opposing
them
was
immense
chetwynd
remembered
these
traits
in
her
two
bright
girls
as
she
welcomed
them
to
their
home
she
was
delighted
to
see
them
of
course
but
it
was
painful
to
observe
their
greasy
serge
dresses
and
their
hair
cropped
like
boys
then
too
their
manners
were
eccentric
and
there
was
nothing
so
distasteful
as
eccentricity
letitia
of
course
looked
all
that
was
sweet
and
nice
but
she
was
not
chewynd
s
own
daughter
which
made
a
great
difference
try
as
she
would
the
widow
could
not
take
the
absorbing
interest
in
letitia
that
she
did
in
eileen
and
marjorie
come
upstairs
my
darlings
she
said
you
must
see
your
charming
little
rooms
esther
has
everything
in
perfect
order
for
you
fires
lighted
and
all
come
this
chetwynd
conveyed
the
girls
upstairs
the
three
rooms
were
on
the
same
landing
and
communicated
one
with
the
other
chetwynd
had
gone
to
some
expense
in
having
doors
broken
in
the
walls
to
effect
this
arrangement
when
completed
the
effect
was
charming
the
rooms
were
papered
with
a
paper
of
pale
blue
there
was
a
deep
frieze
of
flowers
and
birds
the
paint
on
the
doors
and
round
the
wainscot
was
creamy
white
the
furniture
was
also
creamy
white
with
brass
fittings
the
carpet
on
each
floor
was
a
square
of
rich
turkey
the
windows
of
the
three
pretty
rooms
were
a
little
open
and
with
the
cheerful
fires
burning
in
the
small
grates
and
the
sweet
air
coming
in
from
the
square
garden
no
rooms
could
look
more
tempting
delightful
oh
aunt
helen
how
perfectly
sweet
of
you
said
letitia
as
she
danced
into
her
own
little
room
and
do
you
mean
to
say
we
are
to
have
one
each
oh
what
a
darling
little
a
and
all
how
luxurious
we
shall
be
oh
and
do
look
at
those
great
roomy
cupboards
in
the
but
what
do
we
want
great
roomy
cupboards
for
cried
eileen
with
one
dress
for
summer
and
one
dress
for
winter
surely
we
don
t
want
much
room
i
tell
you
what
it
is
eileen
said
marjorie
i
mean
to
use
mine
as
a
for
excellent
thank
you
mother
you
mean
to
use
your
as
a
darkroom
for
photography
said
chetwynd
my
dear
child
you
will
have
little
time
for
photography
when
you
are
introduced
to
her
majesty
and
are
in
the
full
swing
of
a
society
but
mother
i
never
mean
to
be
in
such
a
truly
awful
position
cried
marjorie
her
mother
knitted
her
brows
anxiously
for
goodness
sake
marjorie
don
t
worry
aunt
helen
the
first
evening
cried
dear
aunt
helen
everything
will
be
right
the
girls
have
a
crank
each
of
them
but
these
delightful
rooms
and
you
dear
aunt
helen
ought
to
cure
them
in
no
girls
do
get
off
those
horrid
dresses
and
get
into
respectable
have
respectable
dresses
i
assure
you
aunt
helen
if
you
will
leave
us
we
will
all
come
down
to
the
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
and
here
is
esther
to
wait
on
you
said
chetwynd
you
may
as
well
dress
for
dinner
now
that
you
are
about
it
and
i
will
have
tea
sent
up
to
you
to
your
rooms
we
dine
at
she
left
the
room
as
she
spoke
and
esther
a
girl
came
respectfully
forward
she
looked
with
consternation
at
the
torn
braid
on
eileen
s
dress
oh
please
don
t
bother
about
me
said
eileen
i
wouldn
t
have
the
services
of
a
maid
to
save
my
life
i
hate
to
have
anyone
touch
my
hair
but
myself
besides
as
you
doubtless
observe
my
good
girl
there
is
no
arrangement
necessary
it
is
only
an
inch
long
and
with
a
couple
of
brushes
one
in
each
hand
i
can
push
it
into
any
position
i
like
lettie
if
you
wish
for
esther
please
have
her
your
neat
little
head
sunning
over
with
curls
requires
plenty
of
arrangement
but
not
mine
thank
nor
mine
either
echoed
marjorie
oh
what
a
comfort
it
is
to
have
short
hair
i
never
mean
to
let
my
locks
which
dresses
will
you
wish
to
wear
this
evening
young
ladies
asked
esther
who
had
gaped
in
astonishment
while
the
girls
were
speaking
as
she
spoke
she
held
out
her
hand
for
the
keys
of
their
trunks
here
are
the
keys
said
marjorie
but
i
don
t
know
what
we
have
i
am
sure
there
is
nothing
fit
to
be
seen
but
can
t
we
go
downstairs
as
we
are
perhaps
you
ll
mend
this
braid
said
eileen
if
you
prefer
that
to
cutting
it
off
which
is
much
i
would
suggest
miss
that
you
let
me
choose
your
dress
i
will
unpack
your
things
and
see
what
are
most
suitable
said
the
maid
in
her
prim
voice
all
right
lay
them
on
the
bed
anything
for
a
quiet
life
sighed
marjorie
esther
proceeded
to
take
the
things
out
of
marjorie
s
trunk
and
eileen
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
whistling
somewhat
loudly
and
in
a
thoroughly
boyish
fashion
as
she
did
so
the
maid
quickly
put
the
contents
of
the
small
trunks
into
the
receptacles
for
their
convenience
laid
two
soiled
and
crumpled
of
pale
cream
cashmere
on
the
beds
and
then
retired
to
expend
some
of
her
skill
which
was
considerable
on
letitia
s
pretty
person
and
charming
wardrobe
letitia
was
a
young
lady
quite
after
esther
s
own
heart
chapter
iv
in
the
girls
bedrooms
marjorie
and
eileen
in
soiled
and
much
bedraggled
frocks
went
down
to
dinner
letitia
in
silk
with
lace
ruffles
looked
neat
pretty
and
suitably
attired
but
the
other
two
girls
presented
an
appearance
which
caused
poor
chetwynd
to
shudder
with
their
really
handsome
faces
their
intelligent
eyes
their
lips
and
pearly
rows
of
teeth
they
were
nothing
but
awkward
gauche
and
unpresentable
letitia
was
as
pretty
trim
and
agreeable
to
the
eye
as
a
young
girl
could
be
but
eileen
and
marjorie
what
was
to
be
done
chetwynd
felt
her
heart
sinking
like
lead
in
her
breast
for
there
was
a
stubborn
build
about
marjorie
s
chin
and
about
the
slight
very
slight
frown
which
now
and
then
visited
eileen
s
intelligent
forehead
chetwynd
perceived
at
a
glance
that
if
she
was
to
mold
these
two
girls
to
her
ways
of
thinking
she
would
have
a
troublesome
task
before
her
she
was
rich
and
was
also
and
pleasant
it
was
in
no
way
her
fault
if
the
girls
took
after
their
father
who
had
been
not
only
a
brave
soldier
but
also
that
strange
combination
a
scholar
as
well
and
who
had
died
before
the
girls
education
was
complete
he
was
a
man
of
extraordinary
character
and
determination
and
had
all
his
life
been
the
victim
of
fads
chetwynd
felt
quite
certain
that
their
father
was
to
blame
for
marjorie
s
and
eileen
s
peculiar
appearance
she
was
thankful
that
she
had
not
asked
any
friends
to
meet
the
girls
on
their
first
evening
home
from
school
she
determined
to
make
herself
as
pleasant
as
possible
and
not
to
allude
to
the
untidy
wardrobes
the
gauche
appearance
and
the
cropped
heads
until
the
following
morning
dinner
passed
quickly
for
all
three
girls
were
hungry
and
when
they
retired
to
the
chetwynd
suggested
a
little
music
eileen
my
darling
you
sing
don
t
you
she
said
turning
to
the
younger
of
the
twins
oh
dear
me
no
mother
i
have
not
the
ghost
of
a
voice
replied
eileen
but
i
thought
that
your
teacher
miss
fox
spoke
highly
of
your
musical
talents
she
said
i
should
play
well
if
i
practiced
hard
but
i
did
not
think
my
very
moderate
gift
worth
cultivating
replied
eileen
yawning
slightly
as
she
spoke
you
see
unless
one
has
genius
there
is
not
the
least
use
in
the
present
day
in
being
musical
only
genius
is
tolerated
and
then
i
don
t
ever
mean
to
be
ornamental
my
vogue
in
life
is
the
useful
the
music
of
the
ordinary
after
years
of
toil
is
merely
regarded
as
an
accomplishment
and
generally
as
an
unpleasant
one
therefore
i
have
let
my
music
dear
dear
how
extraordinary
of
miss
fox
not
to
let
me
know
said
chetwynd
well
marjorie
you
at
least
play
said
her
mother
yes
mother
in
a
somewhat
solemn
style
i
can
give
you
one
of
bach
s
fugues
if
you
do
so
my
dear
i
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
on
your
music
and
should
like
to
hear
the
marjorie
rose
went
to
the
piano
sat
down
and
began
to
thunder
loudly
she
had
scarcely
any
taste
for
music
and
she
played
several
wrong
notes
chetwynd
had
a
carefully
trained
ear
and
she
quite
shuddered
when
marjorie
crashed
out
some
of
her
terrible
discords
having
finished
the
fugue
which
took
a
considerable
time
the
young
girl
rose
from
the
piano
amid
a
profound
silence
eileen
had
turned
away
and
was
engrossed
in
a
book
on
cookery
which
she
had
picked
up
from
a
she
was
muttering
to
herself
take
of
flour
one
ounce
butter
cream
three
eggs
what
are
you
doing
eileen
said
the
mother
eileen
made
no
reply
marjorie
seated
herself
on
a
chair
near
her
mother
i
hope
you
liked
that
fugue
she
said
i
took
tremendous
pains
learning
it
i
got
up
every
morning
an
hour
earlier
than
the
others
during
the
whole
of
last
term
simply
because
i
intended
to
play
that
fugue
of
bach
s
to
it
was
a
great
pity
dear
began
chetwynd
then
she
sighed
and
stopped
a
pity
mother
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
nothing
love
we
will
talk
of
all
those
things
what
a
terrible
day
promises
to
be
said
marjorie
glancing
towards
eileen
i
can
see
that
mother
is
going
to
let
the
vials
of
her
wrath
loose
oh
yes
you
dear
old
mammy
you
can
not
deny
it
but
we
are
not
such
dreadful
girls
after
all
all
we
want
to
do
is
this
we
want
to
go
our
own
your
own
way
own
way
yes
mammy
our
own
way
and
you
can
go
yours
then
we
shall
get
on
together
like
a
house
on
fire
now
what
are
you
winking
at
me
for
letitia
i
was
not
winking
at
you
said
letitia
i
was
wondering
if
aunt
helen
would
like
to
hear
me
certainly
my
dear
but
i
never
knew
before
that
you
had
a
i
have
only
a
little
voice
but
i
have
made
the
most
of
my
opportunities
i
won
t
sing
if
you
would
rather
on
the
contrary
dear
i
should
like
to
hear
a
ballad
i
suppose
said
letitia
yes
i
am
fond
of
ballads
what
do
you
know
all
the
usual
ones
i
think
replied
letitia
i
will
sing
robin
adair
if
that
will
suit
i
am
fond
of
robin
adair
said
the
widow
but
few
people
can
render
those
beautiful
words
to
letitia
volunteered
to
try
she
sat
down
to
the
piano
her
accompaniment
was
fresh
and
rippling
her
voice
clear
not
particularly
strong
but
wonderfully
true
it
had
a
note
of
sympathy
in
it
too
which
rang
through
the
old
room
chetwynd
put
down
her
knitting
with
a
sigh
of
pleasure
the
two
girls
sat
with
their
hands
lying
idly
in
their
laps
and
gazed
at
their
cousin
when
the
old
ballad
came
to
an
end
chetwynd
felt
tears
not
far
from
her
eyes
oh
if
only
eileen
and
marjorie
were
like
letitia
marjorie
suddenly
jumped
to
her
feet
are
you
crying
mother
she
said
going
up
to
her
mother
oh
it
s
just
like
that
wicked
lettie
to
hear
her
sing
you
would
suppose
that
she
was
the
most
sentimental
creature
in
the
world
but
don
t
you
believe
a
word
of
it
mammy
she
has
not
one
scrap
of
sentiment
in
her
composition
she
is
the
most
little
soul
that
i
have
ever
come
lettie
don
t
be
a
humbug
sing
something
in
which
your
real
feelings
modern
for
instance
or
something
about
fine
dress
or
nothing
to
wear
or
anything
else
in
your
real
style
it
s
positively
wrong
of
you
to
deceive
mother
in
the
way
you
are
letitia
looked
gently
reproachful
she
said
she
did
not
know
any
song
about
nothing
to
wear
nor
any
song
either
about
dress
but
she
would
sing
shadowland
if
chetwynd
wished
it
this
song
again
brought
the
widow
to
the
verge
of
tears
lettie
then
rose
and
shut
the
piano
you
at
least
my
dear
have
derived
benefit
from
your
education
she
said
how
i
wish
your
dear
father
and
my
dear
husband
were
alive
to
hear
father
could
always
see
through
humbugs
said
eileen
to
marjorie
yes
replied
marjorie
but
don
t
you
see
whatever
mother
is
she
is
not
a
humbug
only
we
don
t
want
lettie
to
twist
her
round
her
little
finger
do
we
said
eileen
no
not
that
it
greatly
matters
poor
mother
i
expect
lettie
will
do
very
much
what
we
do
but
i
m
not
sure
we
must
only
wait
and
the
girls
retired
to
bed
but
chetwynd
sat
up
late
wishing
much
that
she
had
acheson
to
consult
with
what
was
to
be
done
if
marjorie
and
eileen
went
on
in
this
peculiar
manner
which
they
had
done
that
evening
really
when
everything
was
considered
they
were
very
little
better
than
belle
and
belle
happened
to
be
chetwynd
s
bête
noire
if
only
pretty
graceful
accomplished
letitia
were
my
own
daughter
she
is
a
dear
child
and
yet
i
can
not
quite
cordially
take
to
her
thought
the
widow
i
don
t
know
what
is
the
matter
with
her
i
have
no
fault
whatever
to
find
i
suppose
it
is
because
she
is
not
my
own
now
marjorie
and
eileen
rub
me
the
wrong
way
every
time
they
open
their
lips
and
yet
i
love
them
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
how
handsome
they
are
too
anything
could
be
done
with
them
if
only
they
would
submit
to
the
ordinary
regulations
of
polite
society
what
terrible
times
these
modern
days
are
mothers
have
little
or
no
influence
over
their
own
children
the
children
take
the
upper
hand
it
but
i
just
vow
that
marjorie
and
eileen
shall
submit
to
me
in
my
own
house
poor
darlings
they
are
as
loving
as
possible
but
they
have
been
under
some
dreadful
pernicious
influence
i
could
never
guess
that
a
school
so
highly
recommended
as
miss
marchland
s
was
would
send
back
girls
in
the
condition
marjorie
and
eileen
are
in
no
manners
disgraceful
in
appearance
and
no
accomplishments
what
agony
i
went
through
while
marjorie
was
playing
that
fugue
she
must
never
attempt
to
play
in
public
eileen
who
really
had
a
taste
for
music
will
not
cultivate
it
because
forsooth
she
is
not
a
genius
the
two
girls
mean
to
be
merely
useful
with
eyes
like
those
and
lips
and
teeth
my
dear
dear
ridiculous
children
society
will
soon
knock
all
that
nonsense
out
of
your
heads
yes
i
must
present
them
both
as
soon
as
possible
i
shall
order
their
court
dresses
but
that
terrible
cropped
too
not
a
scrap
of
curl
in
it
oh
dear
what
is
to
be
done
and
they
are
both
on
such
a
large
scale
they
would
make
handsome
boys
what
a
pity
they
are
not
boys
dear
me
i
am
an
unhappy
woman
if
letitia
were
my
daughter
it
would
be
plain
sailing
but
as
it
is
i
am
at
my
wits
by
and
by
chetwynd
went
upstairs
she
hesitated
on
the
second
landing
where
her
own
room
was
on
the
next
floor
were
the
girls
rooms
luxuriously
and
beautifully
furnished
it
occurred
to
her
to
go
up
and
look
at
her
darlings
asleep
she
did
so
opening
the
door
of
marjorie
s
room
first
marjorie
was
in
bed
curled
up
as
her
fashion
was
with
the
bedclothes
tucked
tightly
round
her
her
cheeks
were
slightly
flushed
and
the
long
black
lashes
looked
particularly
handsome
as
they
lay
against
her
rosy
cheeks
but
what
a
condition
the
room
was
in
what
was
the
good
of
a
maid
when
girls
went
to
bed
in
such
a
state
of
untidiness
clothes
tossed
everywhere
one
little
shoe
near
the
fireplace
one
near
the
wardrobe
petticoats
flopped
on
the
nearest
chair
the
shabby
serge
dress
which
chetwynd
considered
only
to
be
fit
for
the
next
bag
sent
from
the
kilburn
society
hanging
on
the
brass
knob
of
the
bed
marjorie
sighed
in
her
sleep
and
chetwynd
bent
over
her
dear
lovely
child
i
surely
shall
be
able
to
mold
her
to
my
wishes
she
thought
never
considering
that
marjorie
s
chin
with
its
cleft
in
the
middle
was
full
of
obstinacy
and
that
her
lips
were
as
firm
as
they
were
beautiful
chetwynd
went
on
to
the
next
room
eileen
was
also
sound
asleep
and
her
room
was
also
untidy
the
girl
looked
lovely
with
her
classical
features
and
the
long
straight
lashes
lying
upon
the
soft
rounded
cheeks
yes
they
were
both
singularly
handsome
girls
and
very
like
one
another
of
course
they
would
do
splendidly
yet
perhaps
the
world
would
appreciate
them
all
the
more
for
their
little
eccentricities
they
must
appear
as
débutantes
at
the
very
first
yes
at
an
early
hour
madame
coray
should
put
their
presentation
dresses
in
hand
chetwynd
hesitated
a
moment
before
she
went
into
letitia
s
room
it
would
not
be
very
interesting
to
look
at
letitia
asleep
but
still
what
she
did
for
her
own
girls
she
invariably
did
for
her
husband
s
niece
letitia
s
room
was
in
exquisite
and
perfect
order
everything
put
neatly
away
and
letitia
herself
lying
in
her
little
white
bed
with
her
arms
folded
across
her
chest
and
her
hair
swept
back
from
her
pretty
brow
chetwynd
could
not
help
feeling
drawn
to
her
she
bent
and
kissed
her
on
her
forehead
she
had
not
dared
to
do
this
to
her
own
girls
fearing
to
awaken
them
she
then
went
back
to
her
room
to
sleep
as
best
she
could
chapter
v
the
modern
view
of
life
the
girls
came
home
on
wednesday
and
on
the
following
saturday
acheson
and
belle
were
coming
to
tea
in
the
meantime
chetwynd
had
gone
through
more
than
one
stormy
scene
with
marjorie
and
eileen
the
girls
positively
declined
to
be
presented
to
her
gracious
majesty
you
may
get
the
dresses
mother
said
eileen
only
i
sincerely
hope
you
won
t
for
we
can
not
wear
them
we
don
t
quite
know
yet
what
we
mean
to
do
with
our
lives
but
fashionable
society
girls
we
will
not
be
now
mammy
why
should
we
be
fashionable
girls
if
we
dislike
the
idea
here
marjorie
notwithstanding
her
rude
words
went
on
her
knees
wound
her
strong
young
arms
round
her
mother
s
waist
and
looked
with
such
imploring
eyes
into
her
face
that
notwithstanding
her
anger
chetwynd
was
touched
in
spite
of
herself
we
should
hate
it
all
you
know
dear
mammy
said
marjorie
i
speak
for
eileen
as
well
as
for
agree
with
me
eileen
don
t
you
of
course
replied
eileen
well
marjorie
have
it
out
with
the
dear
mammy
for
i
must
go
at
once
to
see
fowler
s
last
baby
i
am
taking
it
a
rattle
and
some
you
will
kill
a
young
infant
if
you
give
it
chocolate
said
chetwynd
and
i
forbid
you
to
go
to
fox
buildings
no
young
ladies
from
my
house
must
go
near
such
a
dear
me
mother
why
not
said
eileen
eileen
my
dear
i
decline
to
argue
with
you
really
when
i
think
of
all
that
you
two
girls
are
doing
to
oppose
me
and
render
my
life
miserable
i
could
almost
wish
that
you
were
back
at
of
course
mother
said
eileen
gravely
if
you
positively
forbid
me
to
go
i
will
obey
she
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
stared
hard
at
her
mother
i
do
forbid
you
eileen
young
ladies
of
eighteen
are
not
allowed
to
go
about
london
but
really
mother
you
are
mistaken
said
marjorie
in
these
days
they
are
all
that
dreadful
period
of
bondage
in
which
the
girl
of
twenty
years
ago
was
kept
has
passed
away
the
english
girl
of
the
present
day
has
her
freedom
i
have
read
all
about
it
i
know
it
to
be
a
fact
college
girls
too
have
told
me
you
can
not
deny
us
our
birthright
mammy
can
you
college
girls
what
do
you
know
about
college
awful
underbred
unwomanly
creatures
said
chetwynd
you
say
that
mother
because
you
do
not
know
well
i
do
know
one
thing
continued
chetwynd
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
i
can
not
imagine
what
i
have
done
to
deserve
such
girls
as
you
two
i
have
taken
no
end
of
pains
with
you
both
of
course
i
was
obliged
to
stay
in
india
during
your
father
s
lifetime
which
prevented
my
having
as
much
influence
over
you
as
i
should
otherwise
have
obtained
but
i
little
thought
to
come
back
to
such
a
reward
as
this
i
sent
you
to
the
best
schools
i
could
afford
and
have
always
attended
to
your
wardrobe
and
given
you
plenty
of
i
have
done
all
that
a
mother
could
do
and
now
just
when
i
was
beginning
to
expect
my
reward
there
come
back
to
me
a
couple
tomboys
mother
darling
said
marjorie
she
wound
her
arms
still
tighter
round
her
mother
s
waist
and
kissed
her
on
her
cheek
mammy
you
ll
get
accustomed
to
us
after
a
bit
she
cried
we
are
not
in
the
ordinary
groove
but
there
are
hundreds
of
girls
like
us
there
will
be
more
girls
like
us
year
after
year
all
the
modern
training
tends
to
it
mammy
and
you
can
not
keep
us
back
we
are
in
the
van
and
in
the
van
we
will
stay
mammy
we
decline
to
go
into
society
we
decline
to
turn
night
into
day
we
decline
to
spend
unnecessary
money
upon
and
what
do
you
intend
to
do
marjorie
if
i
may
venture
to
ask
said
chetwynd
folding
her
hands
in
an
attitude
of
despair
having
declined
so
much
is
there
anything
you
agree
to
oh
yes
lots
mother
now
you
are
becoming
reasonable
and
we
can
talk
first
of
all
what
we
want
to
know
is
what
allowance
you
will
give
us
both
your
father
made
an
extraordinary
will
said
chetwynd
i
can
not
understand
what
made
him
do
it
and
i
think
he
was
what
was
it
do
let
us
hear
said
eileen
it
was
this
by
his
will
when
you
leave
school
and
reach
the
age
of
eighteen
you
are
both
entitled
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
you
are
not
to
be
coerced
in
the
way
you
spend
the
hip
hip
hurrah
cried
eileen
she
sprang
suddenly
to
her
feet
danced
a
minute
in
front
of
her
mother
and
then
clapped
marjorie
on
the
shoulder
then
of
course
everything
is
plain
she
cried
we
won
t
spend
any
of
that
money
on
dress
who
would
waste
a
precious
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
in
stupid
things
like
frocks
well
children
i
shall
give
you
each
a
proper
wardrobe
to
start
with
said
chetwynd
you
have
not
brought
anything
fit
to
be
seen
from
school
those
dresses
you
have
on
now
are
simply
disgusting
they
are
not
even
clean
i
have
ordered
the
carriage
my
dears
and
am
going
to
take
you
at
once
to
madame
coray
s
she
will
make
you
two
or
three
everyday
dresses
and
some
evening
but
at
least
not
with
our
money
cried
marjorie
that
we
can
not
permit
to
be
spent
in
such
willful
waste
oh
mother
please
do
allow
us
to
dress
as
we
like
do
let
us
order
our
lives
in
our
own
mammy
i
must
know
first
of
all
what
is
your
own
we
want
to
be
useful
members
of
society
and
to
spend
scarcely
any
money
on
clothes
we
have
told
you
that
we
do
not
intend
to
be
presented
to
her
well
i
hope
to
get
you
to
change
your
minds
yet
but
i
will
not
order
the
presentation
dresses
that
s
a
dear
i
knew
you
would
is
the
best
little
mother
in
the
whole
world
said
eileen
rapturously
kissing
her
parent
and
then
clasping
marjorie
s
hand
then
you
will
give
in
all
round
mammy
dear
said
marjorie
suppose
i
say
no
answered
chetwynd
then
i
am
said
eileen
she
glanced
at
marjorie
and
marjorie
nodded
chetwynd
suddenly
rose
girls
she
said
don
t
say
what
you
are
just
about
to
say
i
can
guess
what
it
is
and
i
am
not
prepared
to
listen
until
you
are
of
age
it
is
your
duty
to
obey
me
notwithstanding
your
father
s
will
and
the
improper
allowance
which
i
am
forced
to
give
you
both
as
long
as
you
are
under
my
roof
you
must
be
clothed
as
i
wish
and
you
must
not
go
to
places
that
i
disapprove
of
my
poor
dear
misguided
children
a
woman
s
true
aim
when
she
reaches
maturity
is
to
marry
a
good
husband
and
to
have
a
happy
home
of
her
but
i
never
intend
to
marry
said
marjorie
i
have
not
the
faintest
idea
of
putting
myself
under
the
control
of
any
man
i
mean
to
keep
my
liberty
and
have
a
jolly
good
useful
and
so
do
i
said
eileen
i
mean
to
have
a
very
full
and
very
busy
life
ditto
cried
marjorie
letitia
has
not
yet
spoken
said
what
are
your
wishes
my
love
well
of
course
aunt
helen
i
should
like
a
very
but
you
re
just
not
going
to
have
it
lettie
said
eileen
you
ll
have
to
do
exactly
what
we
do
we
have
no
idea
of
having
our
own
mother
fagged
to
death
an
old
woman
like
mother
taken
out
day
and
night
at
all
hours
just
to
give
you
a
jolly
but
really
my
dears
i
am
not
an
old
woman
said
chetwynd
indignantly
well
mother
you
are
not
as
young
as
you
used
to
be
you
are
forty
if
you
are
a
day
and
no
one
at
forty
can
be
called
a
chicken
it
s
much
more
healthy
for
you
to
go
to
bed
in
good
time
oh
i
have
read
a
lot
about
society
and
all
its
trash
it
just
encourages
one
to
be
terribly
immoral
my
dear
eileen
it
s
awful
to
hear
you
but
it
s
true
mother
for
instance
people
tell
no
end
of
i
call
them
they
say
they
are
not
at
home
when
they
are
they
pretend
to
be
delighted
to
see
a
person
who
in
reality
they
loathe
oh
i
am
acquainted
with
the
ghastly
round
and
if
you
think
i
am
going
to
let
myself
in
for
it
you
are
mistaken
but
dear
old
mammy
you
shan
t
be
worried
any
longer
we
will
go
out
with
you
now
and
we
ll
be
as
good
as
gold
and
you
shall
get
us
each
a
new
serge
dress
and
a
new
sailor
hat
and
a
pair
of
thick
dogskin
gloves
surely
that
is
and
what
about
evening
dresses
and
sunday
dresses
and
visiting
dresses
said
chetwynd
as
to
sunday
dresses
cried
marjorie
i
don
t
see
why
neat
serge
dresses
should
not
do
quite
well
for
church
and
as
to
visiting
dresses
we
do
not
intend
to
visit
in
the
ordinary
sense
the
friend
who
does
not
wish
to
see
us
in
our
serge
costumes
we
do
not
intend
to
there
are
still
evening
dresses
my
but
mother
you
are
not
going
to
take
us
out
to
dinners
you
must
have
one
or
two
dinner
dresses
said
chetwynd
and
that
is
an
end
of
the
matter
go
upstairs
and
put
on
your
hats
i
am
ashamed
to
go
out
with
you
as
matters
now
the
two
girls
left
the
room
linking
their
arms
together
letitia
remained
behind
may
i
ask
letitia
said
chetwynd
when
this
madness
seized
marjorie
and
eileen
it
has
been
coming
on
gradually
said
letitia
it
is
very
bad
i
know
i
was
afraid
you
would
suffer
a
good
deal
when
they
explained
but
when
did
it
begin
well
two
or
three
i
the
school
last
term
and
marjorie
and
eileen
became
great
friends
with
them
and
just
about
then
they
began
to
change
they
were
always
careless
with
regard
to
their
dress
and
would
not
allow
miss
english
teacher
who
had
us
under
her
special
spend
the
money
which
you
sent
on
dress
at
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
miss
ross
consulted
them
well
aunt
helen
they
had
an
extraordinary
way
of
pleading
their
own
cause
i
can
not
understand
it
they
have
saved
a
good
deal
of
money
if
that
is
any
none
whatever
child
i
have
got
more
money
than
i
know
what
to
do
with
and
i
choose
my
girls
to
look
nice
letitia
what
a
pity
it
is
you
are
not
my
own
for
some
reasons
i
wish
i
were
aunt
you
are
so
very
neat
dear
so
very
is
the
only
word
for
it
what
am
i
to
do
with
those
other
two
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
you
will
have
to
give
them
their
own
their
own
way
nonsense
my
dear
impossible
children
only
but
old
enough
according
to
your
own
showing
aunt
helen
to
be
presented
to
the
queen
to
enter
society
and
to
marry
if
suitable
husbands
come
to
the
of
course
but
they
would
be
presented
to
the
queen
by
their
mother
they
would
enter
society
under
their
mother
s
wing
and
if
they
married
their
husbands
would
look
after
them
now
to
allow
those
wild
imps
those
irresponsible
girls
to
have
their
own
way
is
not
to
be
heard
of
for
a
single
well
aunt
helen
i
am
sure
it
will
come
right
in
the
end
they
are
queer
obstinate
girls
but
they
have
got
fine
characters
and
would
not
willingly
pain
you
the
only
thing
is
that
they
look
at
life
from
a
totally
different
standpoint
i
ll
have
a
right
good
talk
with
them
so
try
not
to
fret
i
will
put
it
to
them
that
it
is
their
bounden
duty
to
yield
to
you
they
often
mind
what
i
say
when
they
won
t
mind
their
elders
but
is
not
that
the
carriage
had
not
i
better
get
ready
chapter
vi
belle
the
sage
belle
acheson
was
an
ideal
scholarly
girl
of
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
she
wore
spectacles
not
her
hair
was
parted
smoothly
on
her
forehead
and
done
up
in
a
tiny
knot
or
dab
at
the
back
of
her
neck
her
forehead
was
high
her
complexion
sallow
her
eyes
and
small
she
had
a
long
upper
lip
and
her
mouth
was
thin
and
wide
in
figure
she
was
extremely
spare
her
feet
and
hands
were
large
and
her
shoulders
angular
she
was
a
plain
girl
and
she
gloried
in
the
fact
belle
acheson
lived
altogether
for
the
joys
of
intellect
to
learn
was
her
delight
the
more
abstruse
the
more
dry
the
science
the
more
eagerly
did
belle
absorb
it
and
make
it
part
of
herself
she
was
a
good
classical
scholar
and
was
also
fond
of
modern
languages
she
studied
shakespeare
not
for
his
beauty
of
language
but
for
his
archaisms
she
adored
musty
professors
and
never
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
an
athletic
man
her
ambition
was
to
carry
off
and
some
people
thought
that
she
had
a
fair
chance
of
obtaining
this
blue
ribbon
belle
was
an
inmate
of
wode
s
college
wingfield
there
were
four
halls
of
residence
at
wode
s
and
belle
occupied
an
attic
in
north
hall
she
had
been
there
now
for
three
terms
and
had
already
made
a
profound
impression
on
her
tutors
she
amassed
knowledge
with
great
rapidity
no
nut
was
too
hard
for
her
to
crack
now
if
there
was
a
girl
in
the
entire
of
england
that
chetwynd
loathed
it
was
belle
acheson
acheson
was
chetwynd
s
old
friend
their
husbands
had
fought
side
by
side
in
the
same
campaigns
in
india
they
had
belonged
to
the
same
regiment
she
felt
that
nothing
would
induce
her
to
desert
her
old
friend
but
alas
that
old
friend
s
daughter
it
was
fearful
to
think
that
such
a
girl
was
coming
to
pay
a
visit
to
marjorie
and
eileen
at
this
important
crisis
in
their
lives
can
anything
be
done
to
prevent
it
said
chetwynd
on
the
morning
of
the
fatal
day
she
was
addressing
letitia
who
was
gradually
getting
herself
more
and
more
into
the
good
woman
s
confidence
my
dear
lettie
she
said
i
would
honestly
pay
twenty
pounds
to
any
to
let
his
horse
fall
between
here
and
acheson
s
in
order
to
give
belle
a
wrench
of
the
arm
or
a
twist
of
the
wrist
or
something
which
would
give
her
sufficient
pain
to
send
her
home
then
as
those
are
your
very
heathenish
wishes
aunt
helen
you
may
be
quite
certain
that
belle
will
arrive
in
perfect
health
without
any
accident
not
in
a
hansom
but
in
that
conveyance
which
is
meant
for
the
convenience
of
the
poorer
people
of
chetwynd
sighed
i
beseech
of
you
dear
she
said
not
to
leave
the
children
alone
with
that
pernicious
girl
stay
in
the
room
yourself
when
you
perceive
that
the
conversation
is
getting
into
dangerous
channels
turn
it
my
dear
child
now
remember
lettie
i
trust
you
everything
depends
on
your
i
will
do
what
i
can
of
course
aunt
helen
but
i
must
frankly
admit
that
i
shall
have
very
little
i
only
wish
providence
had
made
you
one
of
my
daughters
if
you
and
marjorie
for
instance
had
been
my
daughters
and
eileen
had
been
you
then
things
might
have
been
quite
pleasant
for
you
would
have
influenced
marjorie
and
brought
her
back
again
into
the
right
ways
as
it
is
as
it
is
we
must
make
the
best
of
things
said
letitia
there
came
a
ring
at
the
and
acheson
and
the
redoubtable
belle
were
ushered
in
acheson
in
her
usual
somewhat
diffident
manner
kissed
chetwynd
and
then
belle
flew
up
to
her
and
gave
her
a
little
peck
on
her
cheek
how
do
she
cried
where
are
the
girls
i
am
most
anxious
to
see
them
at
once
pray
don
t
ring
i
ll
run
up
to
them
i
know
the
old
schoolroom
i
have
a
great
deal
to
say
you
know
i
go
up
again
next
week
and
can
think
of
nothing
else
but
i
determined
that
whoever
else
was
left
in
the
cold
i
must
interview
marjorie
and
eileen
mother
have
you
got
my
small
virgil
in
your
bag
i
am
writing
a
paper
on
that
great
man
and
i
wish
to
read
it
to
the
girls
in
order
to
get
their
they
know
nothing
whatever
about
the
classics
interrupted
chetwynd
i
believe
they
are
going
out
for
a
walk
would
you
like
to
go
with
them
i
don
t
think
we
shall
have
time
for
that
replied
belle
i
ll
find
them
don
t
you
she
nodded
to
chetwynd
and
to
her
mother
in
a
friendly
offhand
style
and
left
the
room
chetwynd
glanced
at
letitia
of
whom
belle
had
not
taken
the
slightest
notice
and
the
young
girl
followed
the
eccentric
scholarly
undergraduate
of
wode
s
upstairs
marjorie
and
eileen
had
an
schoolroom
at
the
top
of
the
house
they
had
cleaned
it
out
themselves
and
put
it
into
order
according
to
their
individual
tastes
it
was
now
neat
and
bare
marjorie
still
wearing
her
shabby
serge
dress
was
standing
near
an
open
window
she
was
holding
a
long
yellow
canary
on
her
finger
and
whistling
to
the
bird
who
pecked
at
her
in
happy
confidence
eileen
was
putting
some
pins
into
a
great
rent
in
her
petticoat
the
door
was
burst
open
and
belle
rushed
in
how
do
dears
both
she
said
in
a
friendly
voice
pray
don
t
rush
at
me
and
devour
me
with
kisses
we
never
go
on
in
that
way
at
north
hall
my
dear
marjorie
how
you
have
grown
oh
i
am
pleased
to
see
you
in
that
plain
serge
dress
and
out
of
order
never
this
pin
will
set
it
finally
do
stop
for
a
moment
belle
of
course
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
said
marjorie
but
i
must
put
daffodil
back
into
his
she
crossed
the
room
still
holding
the
bird
on
her
finger
opened
the
door
of
his
cage
and
let
him
fly
in
she
then
shut
the
and
came
back
to
where
her
friend
was
standing
i
didn
t
know
you
wore
spectacles
belle
she
said
yes
dear
my
sight
is
bad
i
have
been
to
wiesbaden
to
the
celebrated
oculist
and
he
has
ordered
these
special
glasses
i
have
astigmatism
in
one
eye
and
have
therefore
to
wear
special
spectacles
by
the
way
marjorie
you
look
as
if
you
ought
to
be
ought
to
be
said
marjorie
i
am
not
i
have
excellent
you
ought
to
be
repeated
belle
it
gives
one
a
distinguished
look
in
all
probability
you
will
be
very
when
you
come
to
college
most
scholarly
see
by
the
shape
of
your
brow
that
you
are
meant
to
be
obliged
to
wear
when
i
come
to
college
replied
marjorie
and
i
am
supposed
to
be
a
scholarly
girl
delightful
and
yet
i
am
not
sure
that
i
wish
to
be
scholarly
but
what
a
dear
delicious
creature
you
are
belle
sit
down
do
sit
thanks
said
belle
she
squatted
down
on
a
wooden
bench
in
an
ungainly
fashion
crossing
one
leg
over
the
other
letitia
now
advanced
she
had
been
standing
near
the
door
who
is
that
young
person
said
belle
raising
her
very
eyes
and
staring
hard
at
lettie
you
know
quite
well
who
i
am
replied
letitia
i
am
the
cousin
who
has
always
lived
with
the
twins
we
are
all
three
eighteen
and
we
are
coming
out
in
about
a
week
or
a
we
are
not
coming
out
said
eileen
coming
out
cried
marjorie
now
lettie
for
goodness
sake
don
t
be
silly
you
know
that
unpleasant
matter
has
been
arranged
perhaps
you
would
like
to
go
down
to
the
to
mother
and
acheson
eileen
and
i
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
no
i
mean
to
stay
and
listen
replied
lettie
i
may
have
a
good
deal
to
say
to
belle
on
my
own
stay
if
you
wish
to
said
belle
but
i
don
t
suppose
for
a
moment
our
conversation
will
interest
you
you
are
fashionable
and
that
is
quite
what
is
it
you
have
to
say
i
want
to
ask
you
all
about
your
life
dear
said
marjorie
eileen
and
i
have
left
school
we
have
come
home
and
mother
wishes
us
to
go
into
dear
little
mother
the
best
of
souls
but
we
are
not
going
to
allow
her
to
order
our
certainly
not
said
eileen
we
are
going
to
take
our
lives
into
our
own
hands
and
we
wish
to
consult
you
about
the
matter
belle
you
did
you
say
at
wode
s
college
wingfield
the
place
in
all
england
where
women
who
wish
to
distinguish
themselves
ought
to
receive
then
would
you
recommend
us
to
come
to
wode
s
college
asked
eileen
that
i
can
not
say
but
i
will
tell
you
about
it
if
you
like
by
the
way
i
wish
that
young
beg
her
letitia
is
my
name
said
lettie
i
wish
letitia
would
sit
so
that
i
need
not
see
that
fashionable
arrangement
of
her
irritates
me
terribly
why
should
people
waste
time
in
fluffing
and
crimping
their
hair
it
not
only
ruins
the
hair
and
ages
the
appearance
but
what
is
of
much
more
consequence
it
causes
the
unhappy
victim
to
commit
a
a
sin
it
wastes
time
and
oh
time
is
so
precious
i
feel
this
more
and
more
the
longer
i
live
each
precious
valuable
moment
has
to
be
accounted
for
the
brain
is
master
of
the
body
to
enlarge
the
brain
to
cultivate
hear
hear
this
is
as
good
as
a
lecture
said
eileen
go
on
please
belle
you
are
just
the
same
dear
odd
delightful
girl
you
always
whether
i
am
delightful
or
not
it
is
very
rude
of
you
to
interrupt
me
said
belle
frowning
she
had
no
sense
of
humor
and
could
see
no
fun
in
eileen
s
remark
i
will
tell
you
both
about
the
college
if
you
really
wish
to
learn
she
continued
but
i
must
not
stay
here
long
for
i
have
too
much
to
do
mother
mentioned
that
you
had
come
back
from
school
and
that
your
mother
intended
to
take
you
at
once
into
that
whirlpool
of
frivolity
which
is
given
the
name
of
society
and
when
i
heard
that
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
tell
you
both
plainly
what
i
thought
on
the
but
that
is
unnecessary
because
you
see
we
agree
with
you
said
marjorie
well
well
so
far
so
good
but
you
want
my
advice
now
as
to
what
you
will
do
you
distinctly
intend
to
oppose
your
mother
and
that
young
girl
with
the
fashionable
head
i
really
can
not
see
why
i
and
my
head
should
be
dragged
into
this
controversy
said
letitia
i
am
not
speaking
i
am
simply
sitting
and
listening
may
i
not
listen
to
the
words
of
wisdom
which
drop
from
your
lips
you
talk
lettie
as
if
poor
belle
was
minerva
said
eileen
you
know
whatever
we
do
you
ll
have
to
do
because
though
you
are
fashionable
and
horribly
neat
and
particular
about
your
outward
appearance
you
love
us
so
well
that
you
could
not
live
without
there
is
some
truth
in
that
said
letitia
with
a
sigh
well
now
stop
wrangling
you
three
said
belle
and
let
me
speak
you
can
go
on
with
your
quarrel
when
i
am
away
but
during
the
few
moments
that
i
can
spare
from
my
own
heavy
tasks
for
i
have
a
vast
deal
to
acquire
before
i
return
to
college
i
surely
may
be
allowed
to
say
what
i
have
come
to
say
so
good
of
you
to
come
dear
belle
said
eileen
patting
belle
s
long
large
angular
hand
belle
snatched
her
hand
away
i
hate
being
petted
and
fondled
she
said
we
never
do
that
at
north
hall
it
is
so
least
not
those
girls
who
are
worth
anything
in
every
house
of
residence
in
every
college
there
are
drones
poor
useless
creatures
who
follow
the
busy
bees
but
at
wode
s
such
dangerous
adjuncts
to
the
public
peace
are
generally
rooted
out
miss
lauderdale
our
adored
principal
sees
to
that
now
girls
if
you
wish
to
hear
what
the
busy
bees
do
i
will
tell
i
wish
you
would
begin
said
lettie
you
do
nothing
but
walk
round
the
subject
and
never
attack
i
don
t
suppose
it
will
interest
you
said
belle
but
here
the
way
have
either
of
you
two
she
spoke
she
turned
to
eileen
and
have
either
of
you
two
ever
been
to
wode
s
college
wingfield
never
said
eileen
but
fay
everett
a
girl
at
our
school
has
a
sister
there
and
she
sometimes
describes
the
place
to
us
she
said
the
students
rooms
were
so
sweetly
pretty
and
that
each
girl
could
exercise
her
own
individual
good
gracious
am
i
sitting
here
to
talk
of
the
girls
who
are
supposed
to
have
taste
cried
belle
taste
what
is
taste
it
is
nothing
but
a
device
of
the
evil
one
for
wasting
time
i
am
here
to
talk
to
you
about
the
students
the
real
students
i
for
instance
have
a
room
would
you
like
to
know
how
my
room
is
furnished
letitia
gave
a
perceptible
shudder
and
walking
to
the
window
deliberately
shut
it
what
are
you
doing
that
for
said
eileen
it
is
going
to
be
a
very
hot
i
felt
a
sudden
chill
said
lettie
well
do
let
the
window
remain
shut
what
does
it
matter
cried
belle
i
have
placed
myself
high
above
the
mere
influence
of
the
weather
is
it
hot
is
it
cold
i
can
never
tell
i
simply
don
t
know
my
mind
is
absorbed
in
abstruse
speculations
and
such
trivial
matters
as
bodily
discomforts
can
not
touch
it
oh
girls
it
is
grand
to
allow
your
mind
to
soar
have
you
for
instance
ever
dipped
deep
into
the
intricacies
of
virgil
never
said
eileen
she
looked
at
marjorie
i
don
t
think
after
all
she
continued
we
wish
to
be
so
very
learned
our
idea
was
to
be
just
useful
plain
sort
of
women
of
course
we
should
never
think
of
marrying
but
we
should
like
to
be
women
who
help
their
who
are
ready
to
take
their
place
in
a
sudden
emergency
we
want
to
know
a
little
about
nursing
something
too
about
medicine
we
should
not
object
to
going
through
a
regular
course
of
household
training
but
as
to
learning
we
don
t
want
to
be
in
that
case
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
have
i
been
asked
over
here
cried
belle
is
my
precious
time
to
be
wasted
here
she
jumped
up
suddenly
and
confronted
the
two
girls
in
her
agitation
and
anger
her
spectacles
dropped
from
her
nose
they
fell
with
a
crash
on
the
floor
and
one
glass
was
broken
now
what
am
i
to
do
said
belle
oh
the
irreparable
injury
you
two
girls
have
done
me
one
of
my
glasses
is
broken
and
i
who
have
astigmatism
in
one
eye
can
not
get
it
mended
in
a
hurry
it
is
cracked
right
across
most
fortunately
i
took
the
precaution
to
provide
myself
with
another
pair
or
i
should
be
lost
simply
lost
oh
dear
what
a
wasted
afternoon
but
can
t
you
tell
us
what
you
were
going
to
say
even
without
seeing
us
very
plainly
said
eileen
do
belle
sit
down
and
be
comfortable
tell
us
everything
we
are
not
at
all
settled
in
our
own
minds
as
to
what
we
will
do
yet
you
have
a
room
and
it
is
not
ornamental
well
we
don
t
care
about
ornamental
rooms
this
room
is
bare
is
it
not
bare
do
you
call
this
a
bare
room
cried
belle
there
are
six
chairs
for
instance
do
you
ever
expect
to
entertain
six
people
in
the
room
where
you
work
in
addition
to
the
six
ordinary
chairs
there
is
an
armchair
who
wants
to
loll
in
an
armchair
there
is
also
a
bench
on
which
i
am
now
sitting
tell
me
is
a
bench
necessary
as
well
as
six
ordinary
chairs
and
an
armchair
are
four
tables
required
is
that
carpet
essential
does
it
stimulate
the
brain
to
keep
the
feet
upon
a
carpet
are
those
thick
curtains
are
only
traps
to
collect
dirt
blinds
to
the
windows
i
grant
are
required
or
people
might
stare
in
oh
yes
i
will
allow
blinds
they
are
necessary
now
i
will
tell
you
about
my
room
i
have
asked
to
be
put
in
one
of
the
attics
the
house
is
very
full
and
the
of
north
hall
miss
penrose
was
quite
willing
to
oblige
me
the
attic
was
not
furnished
when
i
got
it
and
i
begged
and
implored
of
her
to
allow
me
to
furnish
it
in
my
own
way
i
have
therefore
a
in
one
corner
a
particularly
narrow
one
there
is
a
small
hard
mattress
on
it
the
counterpane
is
colored
it
is
and
does
not
require
to
be
washed
is
one
item
off
the
mind
the
mind
my
dear
is
the
minds
of
those
who
are
students
at
wode
s
such
deep
problems
to
solve
that
they
can
not
be
fretted
by
external
worries
the
minds
of
the
real
students
must
be
left
free
to
solve
intricacies
of
virgil
the
great
masterpieces
of
homer
dante
in
his
magnificent
belle
had
now
forgotten
her
auditors
she
ceased
staring
at
them
her
glasses
were
useless
her
eyes
were
dim
but
nevertheless
she
herself
was
seeing
visions
marjorie
patted
her
on
the
arm
go
on
belle
go
on
she
said
we
will
find
out
about
virgil
and
homer
and
dante
presently
now
what
else
have
you
in
the
room
you
can
not
live
in
a
room
that
contains
nothing
but
a
and
a
blind
and
at
present
that
is
all
you
have
i
have
a
desk
specially
made
for
myself
in
the
window
continued
belle
there
is
a
stool
a
high
stool
on
which
i
sit
the
stool
has
no
back
i
should
scorn
to
lean
back
i
have
a
shelf
on
the
wall
which
contains
my
few
books
twenty
in
works
mostly
in
the
classics
amongst
them
are
to
be
found
polybius
appian
s
civil
war
book
cicero
s
letters
plato
s
republic
bacon
s
novum
organum
aristotle
s
politics
locke
on
the
human
understanding
good
gracious
lettie
was
the
one
who
made
this
exclamation
quiet
quiet
lettie
do
let
her
finish
said
eileen
she
kicked
out
her
foot
and
gave
lettie
a
poke
letitia
drew
in
her
own
neatly
shod
little
foot
and
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
her
eyes
dancing
with
suppressed
mirth
i
have
a
chair
besides
the
one
i
occupy
continued
belle
that
chair
is
for
a
friend
if
a
friend
happens
to
come
in
there
is
a
small
deal
table
upon
which
i
never
allow
a
cloth
to
be
put
as
it
is
apt
to
come
off
and
spill
the
waste
of
time
sopping
up
ink
often
in
my
moments
of
frenzy
have
i
jumped
up
suddenly
and
pulled
the
cloth
with
me
you
don
t
know
what
i
feel
at
times
with
the
greatness
of
the
thoughts
which
surge
through
my
brain
having
spilt
the
ink
three
or
four
times
i
have
discarded
the
cloth
a
is
of
course
essential
and
there
is
a
chest
of
drawers
where
i
keep
my
by
the
way
how
many
dresses
have
you
belle
said
eileen
suddenly
you
two
i
can
not
tell
you
replied
belle
turning
her
eyes
towards
eileen
and
looking
at
her
as
if
she
did
not
see
her
i
have
not
the
faintest
idea
what
dresses
i
have
mother
supplies
them
i
put
a
dress
on
in
the
take
it
off
at
night
occasionally
in
the
excitement
of
my
thoughts
i
have
been
known
to
come
down
to
breakfast
in
an
evening
dress
i
will
admit
that
this
has
attracted
attention
and
annoyed
me
so
as
a
rule
i
am
careful
to
see
that
it
is
a
morning
dress
which
i
am
about
to
but
do
you
think
evening
dresses
necessary
at
all
said
eileen
in
an
anxious
voice
we
think
it
would
be
so
much
more
useful
to
save
our
money
marjorie
and
i
mean
to
do
great
good
in
the
then
if
you
will
take
my
advice
said
belle
jumping
to
her
feet
you
will
come
as
soon
as
possible
to
wode
s
when
you
are
there
i
will
talk
to
you
again
i
can
not
waste
any
more
time
you
will
have
to
pass
in
responsions
but
doubtless
that
could
be
easily
managed
yes
when
you
are
there
i
shall
do
my
utmost
to
guide
you
marjorie
just
let
me
place
my
finger
on
your
brow
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
in
a
moment
whether
you
will
be
able
to
manage
marjorie
submitted
to
this
test
with
exemplary
patience
lettie
laughed
aloud

belle

just
enter
your

my
book

so
you

little
time
to
eileen
let
me
look
at
you
yes
you
also

your
forte
will
be
modern
languages
and
english
literature
all
lighter
accomplishments
you
will
of
course
oh
please
don
t
leave
the
room
said
lettie
bounding
forward
until

on
my
brow
to

what
i
am
worth
really
this
is
most
interesting
you
are
a
kind
of
magician

will
be
one
of

glancing
in
the
direction
where

dignity

dry
with
all
the
talking
i
have
been
obliged
to
go
through
don
t
you
know
chetwynd
that
tea
is
decidedly
bad
for
the
brain
and
also
for
the
coats
of
the
stomach

has
a
shocking
effect
our
best
tutors
at

black
coffee

lecture

great
deal
to
belle
did
not
wait
for
chetwynd
s
most
unwilling
permission
she
sounded
the
electric
bell
by
the
fireplace
and
presently
the
footman
appeared
water
was
supplied
and
the
young
lady
took
a
copious
draught
that
is
refreshing
she
cried
as
she
placed
her
glass
on
the
tray
now
then
mother

more
time

of
misery
and
commiseration
at
her
friend
and
was
hurled
out
of
the
room
by
the
emphatic
belle
a
moment
or
two
later

shut
behind
the
pair

chetwynd
my

marjorie
springing
lightly
into
the
room
accompanied
by
eileen
oh

little
mammy
what

the
matter

marjorie
she
ran
up
to
her
mother
and
kissed
her

quite
worried
you

old
thing

me
smooth
out
those
furrows
on
your
dear
brow

more
like

sit
here
and
i
will
sit
near
you
i
will
pet

soon
forget
all
your
worries

it
not
good
mammy
dear
to
have
a
daughter
on
whom
to
lean
but
if
the
daughter
won
t
be
leant
on
cried
poor
chetwynd
oh
my
child
everything
seems
to
be
and
that
appalling
girl
for
there
is
no
other
word
for
of
course
the
world
did
turn
twenty
years
ago
said
eileen
for
women

is
completely
changed
we
who
were
so
low
are
now
in
the
ascendant
it
is
men
who
are
nowhere
you
dear
mammy
must
be
guided
by
us
for
the
remainder
of
your
days
you
will
live
here
of
course
or
anywhere
else
you
fancy
and
we
will
spend
our
vacations
with
my
dear
dear
eileen
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
talking
about
that
terrible
girl
has
inoculated
you
with
her
democratic
views
she
is
a
fearful
creature
a
sort
of
monster
and
the
queer
extraordinary
things
she
said
and
the
way
she
hurled
her
poor
mother
out
of
the
room
i
have
really
no
words
to
describe
i
do
pity
acheson
but
if
you
think
for
a
single
moment
eileen
that
i
am
going
to
submit
to
you
and
marjorie
having
the
upper
hand
and
managing
your
own
lives
you
are
eileen
uttered
a
deep
sigh
it
will
be
troublesome
she
said
slowly
and
we
would
much
rather
not
be
troublesome
it
would
worry
you
and
we
would
much
rather
not
worry
you
mammy
why
don
t
you
give
in
at
once
it
would
be
so
much
more
graceful
of
you
mammy
it
would
yes
mother
i
wish
you
would
said
marjorie
but
what
am
i
to
give
in
about
said
letitia
have
you
nothing
to
say
you
have
lived
with
us
since
you
were
a
baby
in
every
respect
you
have
been
treated
as
a
daughter
of
the
house
can
t
you
speak
can
t
you
show
these
insubordinate
wicked
girls
how
dreadfully
they
are
acting
it
is
useless
said
lettie
shrugging
her
shoulders
they
are
determined
to
have
their
own
way
i
am
afraid
you
must
bear
it
aunt
chetwynd
burst
into
tears
marjorie
and
eileen
looked
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
pity
i
wish
it
was
not
necessary
said
eileen
i
do
wish
we
could
comfort
you
dear
old
mammy
i
do
wish
we
could
say
that
we
would
be
presented
to
her
majesty
and
go
into
society
six
evenings
out
of
the
seven
but
you
see
we
just
can
t
and
it
would
be
the
maddest
weakness
to
go
into
society
i
will
not
said
marjorie
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
also
think
what
belle
said
is
excellent
and
after
two
or
three
years
of
that
splendid
training
i
yes
yes
yes
i
too
have
made
up
my
mind
interrupted
eileen
mother
dear
you
will
write
to
miss
lauderdale
said
poor
chetwynd
that
awful
girl
gave
me
the
name
what
in
the
wide
world
am
i
to
write
to
her
about
to
get
all
the
necessary
particulars
as
we
want
to
go
to
wode
s
at
the
beginning
of
oh
my
child
i
can
not
permit
it
said
chetwynd
but
mother
dear
do
listen
said
marjorie
she
sat
down
by
her
mother
and
began
to
speak
eileen
took
her
mother
s
other
hand
the
girls
could
talk
well
they
had
plenty
of
intellect
and
they
could
expound
their
views
in
a
simple
and
yet
telling
manner
now
chetwynd
could
never
answer
any
argument
which
required
a
logical
deduction
she
was
therefore
completely
worsted
by
her
clever
and
modern
daughters
each
of
her
little
excuses
each
of
her
small
efforts
to
get
the
girls
to
remain
at
home
with
her
to
go
into
society
to
lead
the
ordinary
life
of
the
ordinary
young
woman
were
quietly
and
politely
demolished
by
both
eileen
and
marjorie
finally
chetwynd
found
herself
saying
she
would
think
about
the
matter
all
three
girls
knew
well
that
when
chetwynd
went
as
far
as
that
the
thing
was
accomplished
don
t
worry
the
mammy
any
more
now
said
eileen
lie
back
in
your
chair
dear
mammy
lettie
run
upstairs
for
mother
s
eau
de
cologne
we
will
put
some
on
her
forehead
poor
dear
darling
she
s
the
sweetest
mother
in
all
the
world
isn
t
she
marjorie
a
perfect
angel
said
marjorie
she
stooped
and
kissed
her
mother
eileen
also
kissed
her
there
they
stood
in
their
shabby
dresses
a
little
piece
of
eileen
s
petticoat
peeping
below
her
skirt
their
short
hair
pushed
up
from
their
foreheads
their
handsome
faces
alight
with
fire
and
excitement
chetwynd
glanced
at
them
and
despair
entered
her
soul
she
had
not
the
slightest
chance
against
them
and
she
knew
it
the
girls
left
the
room
and
only
letitia
remained
behind
well
lettie
you
at
least
will
remain
with
me
said
chetwynd
it
is
terrible
to
feel
that
i
have
brought
girls
like
marjorie
and
eileen
into
the
world
my
only
comfort
is
that
their
poor
dear
a
kind
scholarly
soldierly
not
here
to
witness
their
base
but
really
aunt
helen
i
don
t
think
they
are
base
nor
ungrateful
they
are
just
modern
you
modern
the
reverse
of
archaic
they
must
keep
with
the
times
that
they
have
determined
on
there
is
no
use
whatever
in
opposing
them
doubtless
life
will
teach
them
its
own
lesson
and
they
will
be
delightful
when
they
return
from
wode
how
long
must
they
stay
there
asked
chetwynd
she
took
up
her
handkerchief
as
she
spoke
to
wipe
away
the
tears
from
her
eyes
i
believe
the
usual
course
is
three
years
said
lettie
you
can
not
get
your
certificate
which
is
equivalent
to
a
degree
under
that
your
certificate
which
is
equivalent
to
a
degree
lettie
oh
my
child
not
a
man
living
will
speak
to
the
girls
they
will
never
be
married
lettie
they
will
be
old
maids
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
it
is
fearful
to
think
of
it
well
they
don
t
actually
a
degree
because
it
is
not
allowed
said
lettie
but
they
work
for
it
and
they
get
the
worse
and
worse
cried
chetwynd
you
see
how
sternly
the
men
disapprove
of
this
fearful
step
on
the
part
of
modern
letitia
suppressed
a
short
sigh
the
girls
are
modern
and
nothing
will
make
them
anything
else
she
said
and
yet
my
dear
they
are
the
reverse
of
oh
aunt
helen
i
think
fashionable
women
are
going
going
out
my
dear
what
can
you
mean
i
really
do
think
so
there
will
be
fewer
and
fewer
as
time
goes
on
we
are
so
terribly
earnest
now
we
have
no
time
to
think
of
mere
thank
goodness
lettie
you
at
least
will
always
dress
i
should
think
so
replied
lettie
i
honestly
confess
that
i
am
quite
fond
of
clothes
and
i
like
to
look
well
dear
it
is
a
comfort
that
i
shall
have
you
to
stay
with
but
aunt
helen
i
am
ever
so
sorry
i
think
you
ought
to
let
me
go
you
lettie
you
go
to
wode
s
college
what
do
you
mean
i
think
i
ought
to
go
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
watch
those
two
poor
dear
girls
through
this
eccentric
phase
of
their
existence
think
of
them
aunt
helen
alone
with
belle
acheson
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
said
chetwynd
and
as
acheson
intends
to
go
on
the
continent
in
the
winter
and
she
wishes
me
of
course
i
the
idea
but
i
really
think
i
shall
do
it
now
i
shall
go
about
from
one
fashionable
place
to
another
and
amuse
myself
and
try
to
forget
that
i
have
children
oh
it
is
a
cruel
a
crushing
you
will
live
through
it
said
lettie
she
bent
and
kissed
chetwynd
on
her
cheek
after
all
she
continued
there
is
no
good
in
forcing
marjorie
and
eileen
into
grooves
which
were
never
meant
for
them
you
will
write
to
miss
lauderdale
will
you
not
my
dear
child
have
the
goodness
to
write
to
her
yourself
and
i
will
sign
the
letter
i
have
not
the
faintest
idea
what
i
am
to
say
to
that
i
will
write
then
at
once
said
lettie
she
skipped
across
the
to
her
aunt
s
davenport
took
out
a
sheet
of
paper
rapidly
wrote
a
few
words
and
then
brought
her
letter
to
chetwynd
to
sign
in
less
than
an
hour
that
letter
was
dropped
into
the
nearest
thus
was
the
fate
of
the
three
girls
quickly
decided
chapter
viii
the
gilroys
the
gilroys
lived
in
a
small
house
in
west
kensington
the
house
was
full
to
overflowing
there
were
a
great
many
children
ranging
from
leslie
the
eldest
girl
aged
nineteen
to
little
dan
aged
two
gilroy
was
one
of
the
busiest
women
in
london
she
had
a
small
income
not
exceeding
three
hundred
a
year
and
six
children
to
maintain
when
her
husband
died
a
month
before
little
dan
s
birth
the
mother
made
up
her
mind
not
to
skimp
the
children
s
education
not
to
starve
them
on
a
mere
pittance
but
to
add
to
her
income
by
her
own
exertions
she
was
very
clever
and
strong
both
in
mind
and
body
all
her
children
loved
her
passionately
gilroy
during
his
lifetime
had
been
on
a
large
london
daily
and
after
his
death
gilroy
got
a
post
on
the
staff
she
also
did
a
good
deal
of
other
journalistic
work
and
occasionally
wrote
articles
in
the
magazines
thus
she
added
considerably
to
her
income
and
the
children
never
wanted
for
anything
the
house
was
a
model
of
neatness
and
order
although
there
was
only
one
small
servant
but
then
each
child
had
been
trained
thoroughly
and
each
child
did
his
or
her
appointed
task
without
a
murmur
the
faces
of
all
the
young
gilroys
were
bright
all
the
pairs
of
eyes
were
frank
and
happy
but
the
mother
had
to
work
very
hard
often
and
often
when
all
the
children
were
in
bed
she
sat
up
or
went
round
from
one
editor
s
office
to
another
supplying
the
necessary
items
which
would
appear
the
next
morning
in
the
papers
she
enjoyed
her
work
and
never
complained
and
llewellyn
and
leslie
the
eldest
boy
and
girl
sympathized
heart
and
soul
with
her
on
the
very
day
when
belle
acheson
had
visited
the
chetwynds
in
their
fashionable
house
in
belgravia
gilroy
coming
in
later
than
usual
found
llewellyn
a
handsome
lad
of
sixteen
years
of
age
crouching
over
the
fire
in
the
little
parlor
with
his
head
in
his
hands
what
is
wrong
lew
said
the
mother
nothing
he
answered
i
have
only
been
but
what
about
my
boy
gilroy
seldom
petted
her
children
she
seldom
used
loving
words
to
them
but
then
her
touch
was
a
caress
she
laid
her
hand
now
upon
the
lad
s
shoulder
he
looked
up
into
her
kindly
firm
face
and
the
shadow
fell
from
his
own
it
s
just
nothing
he
cried
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
don
t
ask
me
at
the
present
moment
mother
i
have
a
fit
of
the
blues
that
s
well
and
i
have
a
fit
of
the
cheerfuls
said
gilroy
what
do
you
mean
mother
llewellyn
was
all
life
and
spirits
in
a
moment
has
anything
good
happened
have
you
got
another
post
are
you
to
be
made
on
one
of
the
great
dailies
that
you
know
is
your
ambition
your
great
passionate
ambition
little
nothing
of
the
kind
at
present
lew
dear
i
am
just
where
i
always
was
i
have
plenty
of
work
and
i
am
paid
fairly
well
but
i
have
good
news
all
the
same
i
will
tell
you
afterwards
it
has
to
do
with
leslie
it
will
be
the
finest
thing
in
all
the
world
for
her
simply
the
making
of
llewellyn
s
face
once
more
looked
downcast
he
did
not
want
his
mother
to
observe
it
however
and
he
went
slowly
to
the
door
i
had
better
let
kitty
and
mabel
know
that
you
are
in
he
said
he
went
into
the
little
hall
and
shouted
his
sisters
names
the
next
moment
two
trim
little
girls
with
long
hair
hanging
down
their
shoulders
in
frocks
and
white
pinafores
came
tripping
in
mother
s
come
said
llewellyn
she
wants
tea
sound
the
gong
when
it
is
he
bounded
up
the
narrow
stairs
three
at
a
time
to
his
own
special
den
at
the
top
of
the
house
there
big
handsome
overgrown
boy
that
he
was
he
shed
some
tears
he
was
ashamed
of
his
tears
they
scalded
right
down
into
his
heart
i
wish
i
didn
t
feel
it
so
much
he
said
to
himself
i
just
had
a
wild
hope
for
a
moment
when
mother
spoke
about
good
news
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
me
but
it
s
only
leslie
well
dear
old
girl
why
shouldn
t
it
be
about
her
what
a
brute
i
am
to
grudge
it
to
her
she
is
mother
s
right
hand
and
about
the
very
best
girl
in
the
world
there
i
shall
hate
myself
if
i
give
way
another
moment
i
ll
just
tell
mother
right
out
and
put
an
end
to
the
thing
she
ll
be
a
bit
surprised
but
i
guess
she
ll
be
only
too
glad
to
consent
it
s
to
daydreams
that
s
all
but
a
fellow
can
t
think
of
them
when
his
mother
is
in
the
meanwhile
the
girls
downstairs
were
quickly
preparing
the
tea
kitty
went
to
the
kitchen
to
fetch
the
tray
with
the
cups
and
saucers
mabel
laid
the
white
cloth
which
was
made
of
the
finest
damask
on
the
center
table
kitty
then
knelt
down
before
the
fire
to
make
an
apparently
unlimited
supply
of
buttered
toast
mabel
put
the
right
amount
of
tea
into
the
old
teapot
there
were
many
relics
of
bygone
respectability
nay
of
bygone
wealth
in
the
gilroys
humble
house
the
silver
teapot
was
was
real
silver
not
electroplate
it
was
very
thin
and
of
an
antique
shape
and
the
children
were
often
heard
to
declare
that
nothing
would
induce
them
to
have
their
tea
made
in
anything
else
the
cups
and
saucers
too
were
of
rare
old
china
and
of
a
quaint
pattern
they
were
neither
cracked
nor
broken
because
the
girls
themselves
washed
them
and
looked
after
them
and
put
them
away
in
the
little
pantry
the
small
maid
of
all
work
elfreda
was
never
allowed
to
go
near
the
pantry
she
only
did
the
rough
work
under
severe
superintendence
from
kitty
but
the
house
was
perfectly
organized
and
no
one
felt
unduly
fatigued
the
tea
when
it
was
ready
consisted
of
fresh
eggs
honey
in
the
comb
hot
cakes
which
mabel
had
been
secretly
watching
for
the
last
a
pile
of
buttered
toast
bread
both
brown
and
white
delicious
country
butter
tea
and
even
cream
when
everything
was
in
order
mabel
sounded
the
gong
and
llewellyn
came
down
he
had
scarcely
taken
his
place
at
the
table
before
there
was
the
click
of
a
latchkey
in
the
hall
door
and
light
steps
the
steps
of
a
young
girl
were
heard
in
the
passage
outside
there
s
leslie
said
gilroy
she
was
seated
at
the
head
of
her
table
pouring
out
tea
she
paused
now
and
a
look
of
considerable
expectancy
filled
her
eyes
llewellyn
watched
her
the
others
engaged
in
their
own
chatter
took
no
special
notice
leslie
late
as
usual
said
mabel
just
at
that
moment
leslie
poked
in
her
head
oh
do
just
keep
a
nice
hot
cup
of
tea
for
me
she
called
out
i
am
starving
there
has
been
such
a
cold
wind
blowing
and
i
had
to
walk
half
the
way
as
every
omnibus
was
full
i
ll
just
run
upstairs
to
tidy
up
please
keep
a
right
good
tea
for
me
i
ll
trust
you
yes
you
may
shouted
out
mabel
i
am
keeping
back
the
crispest
of
the
hot
cakes
and
there
is
buttered
toast
in
a
covered
dish
by
the
leslie
s
steps
were
heard
running
quickly
upstairs
and
a
minute
or
two
later
she
entered
the
room
she
was
a
tall
girl
with
quantities
of
hair
large
brown
eyes
a
complexion
of
cream
and
roses
and
straight
regular
features
it
needed
but
a
glance
to
show
that
she
was
a
beautiful
girl
with
beauty
above
the
average
but
it
was
not
only
the
regularity
of
her
features
and
the
clearness
of
her
complexion
which
made
leslie
s
face
so
specially
attractive
it
was
the
marked
and
wonderful
intelligence
on
her
open
brow
the
speaking
thoughtful
expression
in
her
eyes
the
firm
proud
outline
of
her
beautiful
lips
gilroy
just
glanced
up
when
her
eldest
daughter
came
into
the
room
that
one
glance
showed
that
the
girl
was
the
mother
s
special
idol
that
she
loved
her
with
a
worship
which
was
almost
idolatry
that
she
was
a
shade
more
proud
of
her
and
dreamt
more
daydreams
about
her
than
about
any
of
the
others
llewellyn
who
could
read
his
mother
like
a
book
who
loved
her
passionately
saw
all
these
thoughts
now
in
her
eyes
he
suppressed
a
sigh
and
attacked
the
loaf
with
vigor
come
leslie
said
her
mother
here
is
your
place
by
me
as
usual
now
have
a
good
tea
my
darling
for
we
have
much
to
talk
of
afterwards
i
want
all
of
you
children
to
be
present
too
you
must
all
hear
my
good
good
news
mother
that
s
cheering
said
leslie
i
have
had
such
a
cross
do
you
mean
said
kitty
do
tell
us
leslie
what
can
have
happened
didn
t
you
get
on
with
your
pupils
no
they
were
contrary
they
would
play
and
would
not
learn
i
didn
t
seem
to
have
any
control
over
them
mother
dear
i
am
sick
of
teaching
what
rot
cried
llewellyn
one
must
go
on
with
a
thing
whether
one
is
sick
or
oh
i
know
lew
dear
old
boy
and
i
really
don
t
mean
to
grumble
only
i
felt
cross
and
i
am
owning
to
it
i
don
t
feel
cross
now
added
the
girl
she
helped
herself
to
brown
bread
and
butter
kitty
put
a
quantity
of
honey
on
her
plate
tea
came
to
an
end
presently
and
then
the
children
in
orderly
file
began
to
remove
the
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
little
always
sat
in
the
parlor
in
the
looking
as
snug
and
comfortable
as
a
room
could
look
the
lamp
beautifully
trimmed
and
burning
clearly
stood
on
the
center
table
the
red
curtains
were

at

mother

she
asked

late

to
attend
two
big
functions
and
must
take
my
copy
afterwards
to
the
and
the
llewellyn
fidgeted
he
stood
up
and
then
sat
down
again
he
looked
at
his
mother
as
if
about
to
speak
and
then
restrained
himself
what
s
the
matter
lew
what
are
you
worrying
about
said
his
sister
it
s
only
the
thought
of
mother
doing
this
beastly
grind
night
after
night
he
said
it
drives
me
my
dear
boy
i
enjoy
it
said
the
mother
and
you
shall
take
my
place
all
in
good
time
there
is
an
excitement
about
the
life
which
exactly
suits
me
i
could
never
be
a
drone
even
if
i
wished
it
even
to
please
you
dear
old
the
mother
bent
forward
as
she
spoke
and
gave
the
boy
one
of
her
rare
caresses
just
a
touch
on
his
white
forehead
he
sat
down
near
her
another
boy
would
have
held
out
his
hand
for
his
mother
to
clasp
but
llewellyn
s
long
hands
hung
between
his
knees
he
was
bending
over
the
fire
looking
into
the
blaze
the
daydreams
which
he
had
so
often
seen
in
those
flames
were
receding
farther
and
farther
away
his
face
was
pale
and
the
expression
of
his
gray
eyes
heavy
but
gilroy
too
much
interested
in
leslie
at
present
to
notice
her
son
s
depression
continued
to
talk
cheerfully
by
and
by
she
would
see
it
all
and
speak
of
it
but
not
just
now
quite
within
the
appointed
time
the
three
girls
returned
they
took
up
their
work
for
never
for
a
moment
in
this
family
was
idleness
allowed
and
sat
down
near
the
lamp
now
then
we
are
ready
said
hester
but
i
do
wish
before
mother
begins
that
you
would
show
me
kitty
how
you
turn
this
heel
i
know
i
am
doing
it
i
should
think
you
are
you
old
goose
said
kitty
well
i
can
t
show
you
at
present
just
take
the
needles
out
and
unravel
a
few
rows
then
put
the
needles
in
again
and
i
ll
be
ready
to
give
you
a
lesson
before
bedtime
but
remember
i
am
going
to
charge
for
it
it
s
a
farthing
a
lesson
and
the
money
to
go
to
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
is
not
that
a
good
idea
mother
continued
kitty
looking
up
but
gilroy
was
not
listening
she
had
something
important
to
say
and
the
mere
idle
chatter
of
this
happy
family
passed
over
her
ears
unnoticed
leslie
she
said
laying
her
hand
on
her
eldest
girl
s
arm
my
news
has
to
do
with
you
but
as
we
have
no
secrets
in
our
family
i
will
tell
it
before
the
rest
of
the
leslie
looked
eager
and
excited
even
llewellyn
dropped
his
despondent
air
and
stood
up
big
and
manly
five
feet
ten
on
the
hearthrug
his
mother
glanced
at
him
noticed
without
really
noticing
it
the
marked
look
of
power
on
his
intellectual
face
and
then
turned
to
her
favorite
child
i
was
in
my
usual
place
at
the
office
of
the
she
began
i
was
busily
engaged
preparing
copy
for
s
issue
when
a
gentleman
an
old
friend
of
your
father
s
a
certain
parker
came
mr
parker
a
friend
of
father
s
i
never
heard
of
him
before
said
leslie
he
has
been
in
australia
for
the
last
twelve
years
but
has
just
returned
home
he
sent
in
his
card
and
begged
to
see
me
as
soon
as
ever
i
saw
him
i
remembered
that
your
dear
father
had
constantly
spoken
of
him
well
he
wishes
to
do
something
the
sake
of
his
old
gilroy
s
voice
faltered
he
is
quite
a
gentleman
she
continued
though
a
little
rough
but
a
capital
good
fellow
at
bottom
he
spoke
to
me
most
frankly
and
finally
ended
by
making
me
an
offer
the
offer
has
to
do
with
you
with
me
said
leslie
yes
darling
he
asked
me
all
about
our
means
he
was
not
at
all
prying
he
was
good
and
kind
and
oh
so
generous
at
heart
i
hated
to
tell
him
and
yet
i
felt
obliged
to
he
was
shocked
he
thought
your
father
would
have
left
us
better
he
had
no
right
to
ask
about
our
father
s
means
grumbled
llewellyn
no
one
could
have
worked
harder
than
our
father
no
one
truly
echoed
leslie
and
no
one
ever
led
a
more
upright
exemplary
splendid
life
said
the
widow
her
voice
trembled
she
paused
for
a
moment
kitty
and
mabel
laid
down
their
needlework
but
all
the
same
continued
the
mother
you
must
not
blame
parker
he
and
your
father
had
not
met
for
many
years
and
in
australia
they
lead
a
different
life
when
a
man
is
lucky
there
he
is
very
lucky
and
parker
has
been
one
of
the
lucky
ones
he
took
shares
in
some
and
explained
to
me
that
he
is
now
a
man
of
great
he
must
have
interrupted
your
work
a
good
bit
began
llewellyn
then
he
checked
himself
his
mother
glanced
at
him
took
no
notice
of
his
speech
and
continued
with
her
story
the
result
of
our
interview
is
this
she
said
looking
round
at
her
children
and
laying
her
hand
on
leslie
s
arm
leslie
is
to
have
a
chance
a
right
good
chance
in
mother
what
do
you
mean
said
leslie
she
opened
her
pretty
eyes
wide
and
the
color
rushed
into
her
face
mr
parker
is
a
man
of
peculiar
views
said
the
mother
he
does
not
want
to
help
boys
he
says
they
must
stand
or
fall
on
their
own
merits
but
for
girls
he
has
a
peculiar
feeling
an
unbounded
pity
the
fact
is
poor
fellow
he
had
a
wife
of
his
own
and
a
daughter
and
if
the
daughter
were
alive
she
would
be
your
age
leslie
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
accounts
for
his
prejudice
in
favor
of
girls
now
my
darling
he
has
offered
to
pay
all
your
expenses
either
at
newnham
or
at
that
other
great
college
wode
s
wingfield
he
wants
you
to
give
up
your
present
employment
immediately
and
to
go
to
either
of
these
places
at
the
beginning
of
term
you
are
to
have
every
advantage
that
is
possible
when
you
have
completed
your
university
education
he
will
take
further
steps
to
insure
your
commanding
an
excellent
living
the
money
is
to
be
paid
direct
to
me
as
required
and
he
has
now
given
me
a
check
for
fifty
pounds
to
buy
the
necessary
outfit
which
you
will
require
for
your
new
life
i
have
taken
the
check
and
have
accepted
the
offer
that
is
my
news
it
is
a
great
chance
for
you
leslie
it
is
a
great
chance
you
go
away
from
us
i
know
my
darling
and
i
shall
miss
you
terribly
but
it
is
a
great
and
you
have
really
accepted
it
mother
i
have
i
could
not
allow
you
to
throw
it
away
parker
is
such
an
old
friend
of
your
father
s
that
i
am
willing
to
put
myself
under
this
supreme
obligation
he
has
even
hinted
that
by
and
by
he
will
do
great
things
for
kitty
and
for
and
what
about
poor
hester
said
that
individual
dropping
her
stocking
and
looking
with
piteous
eyes
at
her
mother
you
are
to
be
my
then
hester
rose
and
knelt
by
her
mother
and
put
her
strong
young
arms
round
her
waist
and
kissed
her
yes
i
for
one
would
never
leave
you
mammy
and
i
don
t
care
a
pin
about
being
learned
i
want
just
to
be
useful
although
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
bit
of
a
failure
all
round
there
always
is
a
failure
in
every
family
isn
t
there
mother
so
it
s
just
as
well
that
i
should
be
the
we
mean
to
have
no
failures
in
this
family
said
gilroy
now
then
you
young
ones
it
is
time
for
bed
off
you
go
at
once
i
have
much
to
say
to
leslie
and
to
llewellyn
by
chapter
ix
one
taken
the
other
left
when
the
younger
girls
had
rather
unwillingly
left
the
room
leslie
took
a
seat
near
her
mother
llewellyn
going
to
a
bookcase
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
began
to
fumble
with
some
books
come
here
lew
called
out
his
sister
we
want
you
to
talk
to
us
and
give
us
your
advice
you
are
always
so
wise
come
what
are
you
doing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
are
you
not
delighted
are
not
you
as
glad
as
i
am
llewellyn
responded
to
leslie
s
invitation
unwillingly
his
mother
looked
up
at
him
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
nothing
mother
i
am
on
the
whole
heartily
his
reply
came
slowly
and
as
though
he
had
weighed
each
word
but
i
don
t
at
all
know
that
i
ought
to
accept
even
though
mother
is
so
good
as
to
give
me
leave
said
leslie
that
s
all
rot
you
know
leslie
said
her
brother
roughly
mother
has
accepted
the
thing
is
done
it
is
a
chance
which
may
never
come
in
your
way
but
i
don
t
want
it
she
cried
touched
to
her
very
heart
s
core
by
something
in
his
voice
if
it
were
only
your
chance
how
happy
i
should
be
oh
lew
with
your
tastes
with
your
wishes
what
could
you
not
achieve
you
know
it
has
been
the
passion
of
your
heart
since
you
were
a
little
boy
to
go
to
one
of
the
universities
and
mother
dear
it
is
surely
not
too
late
you
could
speak
to
parker
you
could
explain
to
him
that
llewellyn
is
the
one
in
the
family
with
genius
that
llewellyn
will
do
him
credit
if
he
sends
him
to
oxford
or
cambridge
oh
leave
me
out
i
can
do
without
the
university
training
but
would
be
the
making
of
lew
i
suppose
i
am
fairly
well
educated
i
have
passed
right
through
the
high
school
from
the
beginning
and
no
girl
who
does
that
can
be
said
to
be
ignorant
this
chance
ought
to
be
llewellyn
s
mother
it
would
be
possible
surely
for
you
to
put
it
to
parker
in
the
right
light
no
leslie
he
wishes
you
to
go
said
the
mother
quietly
i
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
i
have
accepted
for
you
look
upon
it
my
darling
as
a
settled
thing
and
do
not
disturb
with
the
thought
of
any
indecision
the
great
joy
which
ought
to
be
there
is
a
ring
at
the
hall
door
cried
leslie
i
wonder
who
it
can
be
gilroy
started
i
quite
forgot
she
said
coloring
slightly
mr
parker
asked
if
he
might
come
round
and
be
introduced
to
you
all
doubtless
that
is
his
ring
llewellyn
dear
will
you
go
and
open
the
hall
door
llewellyn
strode
across
the
room
i
feel
quite
overcome
said
leslie
to
her
mother
i
never
heard
of
parker
until
half
an
hour
ago
and
now
he
is
an
immense
factor
in
my
her
words
were
interrupted
the
door
of
the
little
parlor
was
thrown
open
and
parker
accompanied
by
llewellyn
entered
here
i
am
here
i
am
as
i
promised
called
out
the
former
rubbing
his
hands
as
he
spoke
and
pushing
up
his
red
hair
from
his
almost
as
red
forehead
here
i
am
and
right
glad
to
see
you
again
gilroy
and
so
these
are
some
of
the
youngsters
what
s
your
name
young
sir
llewellyn
replied
the
boy
and
how
old
may
you
be
sixteen
replied
llewellyn
pon
my
word
you
re
a
chap
we
don
t
have
em
better
in
the
bush
notwithstanding
all
the
fine
development
that
hard
work
gives
but
you
have
fine
and
good
stout
legs
fine
young
chap
gilroy
i
congratulate
you
ma
am
in
possessing
him
and
so
this
is
the
young
lady
how
do
you
do
my
dear
i
am
proud
to
make
your
parker
s
voice
had
been
rough
enough
while
he
was
addressing
llewellyn
but
when
he
glanced
at
leslie
who
tall
straight
and
beautiful
stood
before
him
a
spasm
crossed
his
face
and
his
voice
faltered
it
sank
to
a
husky
whisper
there
was
emotion
in
his
tone
how
do
you
do
my
dear
he
said
again
and
he
held
out
a
great
rough
hand
for
the
girl
to
shake
she
let
her
little
hand
lie
in
his
for
half
a
moment
and
then
withdrew
it
she
then
went
and
stood
by
the
fireplace
sit
down
please
parker
said
gilroy
leslie
i
think
our
friend
would
like
a
glass
of
wine
will
you
get
it
no
wine
for
me
thank
you
ma
am
no
wine
for
me
i
have
dined
and
admirably
steak
and
stout
and
boiled
apple
pudding
that
s
fare
after
my
own
heart
simple
ma
am
you
can
as
my
own
tastes
well
i
am
glad
to
see
you
gilroy
at
home
and
a
nice
snug
little
parlor
you
have
no
show
or
pretension
or
anything
of
that
kind
just
the
sort
of
room
i
d
expect
gilroy
s
widow
to
have
and
added
the
man
glancing
at
the
boy
and
girl
just
the
sort
of
children
the
two
children
thus
alluded
to
could
not
help
sighing
llewellyn
wished
himself
fifty
miles
away
leslie
felt
uncomfortable
and
did
not
dare
to
meet
her
mother
s
eyes
meanwhile
parker
glanced
around
him
the
ceiling
of
the
little
room
was
low
and
the
furniture
although
exquisitely
clean
and
orderly
was
shabby
he
sank
back
in
the
armchair
which
gilroy
had
invited
him
to
take
possession
of
and
proceeded
to
speak
slowly
and
thoughtfully
this
all
reminds
me
of
poor
gilroy
he
said
and
yet
i
expected
him
with
his
talents
to
live
in
a
palace
by
this
time
instead
of
that
he
has
his
six
foot
of
six
foot
of
earth
ma
what
we
all
will
come
to
some
day
and
you
are
left
a
widow
and
with
the
care
of
that
big
boy
on
your
i
won
t
be
on
mother
s
shoulders
any
longer
grumbled
llewellyn
ha
ha
young
sir
don
t
you
be
impatient
let
me
say
my
say
out
this
young
lady
now
she
s
my
charge
for
the
future
yes
ma
am
she
s
my
charge
my
dear
miss
leslie
you
ll
be
a
sort
of
adopted
daughter
to
me
now
sit
down
near
me
and
tell
me
what
your
inclinations
are
i
think
your
mother
would
send
you
to
one
of
those
women
s
colleges
if
you
liked
it
but
if
your
inclinations
are
not
set
that
way
why
i
will
set
you
up
in
business
i
ll
give
you
capital
and
you
may
do
line
you
like
you
have
only
to
name
it
but
your
mother
suggests
that
i
should
make
an
educated
woman
of
to
a
certain
extent
leslie
is
that
already
interrupted
the
mother
she
saw
that
the
girl
found
it
difficult
to
reply
that
her
lips
were
trembling
and
her
eyes
shining
through
tears
my
dear
child
has
the
best
education
i
could
give
her
continued
gilroy
please
llewellyn
take
a
the
boy
flung
himself
down
on
the
nearest
seat
mr
parker
i
have
just
been
telling
my
children
of
your
great
kindness
continued
gilroy
leslie
is
of
course
delighted
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
she
would
like
better
than
to
go
through
one
of
the
universities
she
wishes
by
and
by
to
earn
her
bread
as
a
teacher
and
if
she
does
that
it
is
essential
that
she
should
have
the
best
education
that
can
be
well
ma
am
if
that
s
your
whim
it
s
mine
also
said
parker
i
am
only
gratified
to
be
able
to
please
you
in
any
way
this
is
a
debt
i
owe
ma
am
so
there
s
no
obligation
on
your
part
nor
on
yours
either
miss
a
debt
you
owe
said
gilroy
in
some
astonishment
well
you
see
it
was
this
way
said
parker
gilroy
and
i
were
lads
together
in
the
same
school
i
don
t
mean
to
say
that
we
were
exactly
in
the
same
set
for
gilroy
belonged
to
gentlefolks
whereas
my
father
kept
a
grocer
s
shop
i
always
had
a
wonderful
admiration
for
gilroy
for
though
he
was
an
aristocrat
as
they
call
them
he
had
no
high
and
mighty
ideas
and
he
was
good
to
me
and
wouldn
t
let
the
other
fellows
trample
on
he
not
he
and
one
day
i
got
out
of
my
depth
before
i
could
swim
quite
well
and
he
pulled
me
to
shore
he
made
nothing
of
it
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
saved
my
life
so
after
that
there
was
nothing
i
wouldn
t
do
for
him
and
when
we
both
left
school
and
gilroy
was
going
to
one
of
your
fine
universities
and
i
was
off
to
the
colonies
we
had
a
supper
together
and
at
the
end
of
the
supper
we
made
a
bargain
one
with
the
other
gilroy
said
to
me
parker
nobody
knows
what
the
chances
of
life
are
it
is
possible
that
you
may
come
back
some
day
a
rich
man
if
so
don
t
forget
that
we
were
chums
that
we
were
lads
together
and
if
you
can
do
a
kindness
to
me
or
mine
do
it
i
am
an
unmarried
man
and
so
are
you
we
are
both
young
fellows
on
the
threshold
of
life
but
if
ever
i
should
have
a
wife
and
children
and
i
myself
should
be
beneath
the
sod
you
will
look
after
them
for
me
parker
it
shall
be
a
bargain
between
us
and
i
will
do
the
same
for
your
wife
and
children
should
the
position
be
those
were
his
words
ma
am
said
parker
standing
up
as
he
spoke
and
i
never
forgot
they
followed
me
all
through
the
years
and
when
i
heard
of
his
death
i
felt
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
for
it
but
to
wind
up
my
affairs
and
to
hurry
back
as
fast
as
possible
there
were
gilroy
s
bonds
that
he
had
laid
upon
me
and
i
had
to
see
to
it
that
i
obeyed
the
last
words
he
ever
said
to
me
night
after
night
i
d
see
him
standing
by
my
bedside
the
light
in
his
eyes
seemed
to
shine
into
mine
and
i
felt
again
the
way
he
gripped
my
hand
well
ma
am
it
has
pleased
the
almighty
to
take
my
wife
and
child
away
from
me
and
i
am
here
at
your
service
and
with
the
orders
of
your
dead
husband
to
do
what
i
can
for
you
and
yours
my
dear
added
parker
suddenly
turning
and
looking
at
leslie
you
have
a
look
of
your
father
the
best
fellow
that
ever
breathed
you
must
let
me
to
a
certain
extent
be
a
father
to
you
my
own
wife
is
dead
and
girl
too
aye
the
girl
was
bonny
i
ll
show
you
her
picture
some
day
miss
leslie
did
not
reply
but
the
tears
which
had
been
coming
to
her
eyes
now
rolled
down
her
cheeks
parker
noticed
her
emotion
and
was
not
ill
pleased
with
it
you
go
to
college
if
you
wish
it
young
lady
he
said
and
i
hold
the
when
you
want
money
you
just
write
to
me
and
don
t
bother
that
good
mother
of
yours
overmuch
so
that
affair
is
settled
now
to
turn
to
the
others
this
boy
for
instance
he
is
gilroy
s
boy
and
worthy
of
his
father
what
do
you
mean
to
do
sir
do
you
want
a
university
life
too
oh
if
you
would
only
give
it
to
him
said
leslie
mother
says
you
are
rich
and
if
it
is
really
as
you
say
and
father
laid
his
bond
upon
you
it
does
not
seem
too
hard
oh
if
you
would
only
do
it
her
whole
face
lit
up
her
eyes
shone
and
she
laid
her
hand
on
parker
s
arm
i
d
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
my
dear
so
if
it
is
your
wish
you
have
only
to
say
the
word
the
boy
looks
intelligent
too
in
australia
we
would
give
a
boy
like
that
a
bit
of
the
bush
to
clear
out
and
a
house
to
build
and
we
would
teach
him
the
rough
essentials
of
life
and
leave
out
the
polishings
but
australia
is
australia
and
england
is
england
and
as
it
seems
to
be
all
the
development
of
the
brain
and
the
body
too
said
gilroy
you
can
not
say
that
we
do
not
develop
the
bodies
of
our
lads
as
long
as
we
have
football
and
we
have
those
too
in
australia
and
we
manage
to
beat
you
once
in
a
while
said
parker
with
a
slight
twinkle
in
his
eyes
but
what
does
the
lad
want
is
the
question
llewellyn
wants
to
go
either
to
oxford
or
cambridge
said
leslie
it
has
been
the
dream
of
his
yes
it
has
been
the
dream
of
his
life
replied
the
mother
she
glanced
at
llewellyn
whose
face
was
now
white
as
death
it
is
the
dream
of
my
life
no
longer
he
said
his
voice
was
husky
not
to
say
rough
then
what
is
it
you
want
my
boy
parker
went
up
and
clapped
his
hand
heavily
on
the
boy
s
shoulder
nothing
from
you
sir
was
llewellyn
s
answer
oh
i
am
obliged
of
course
or
i
try
to
be
obliged
but
i
don
t
want
anything
what
is
more
sir
i
wouldn
t
take
llewellyn
said
his
mother
i
don
t
wish
to
take
anything
from
parker
mother
i
was
about
to
tell
you
when
we
were
alone
but
i
will
tell
you
now
instead
i
accepted
a
situation
at
lee
forrest
lee
forrest
s
said
the
mother
you
accepted
a
situation
at
that
big
draper
s
round
the
corner
llewellyn
you
must
be
mad
i
am
not
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
for
some
time
this
is
not
as
sudden
as
it
looks
to
you
you
know
young
forrest
has
been
my
friend
at
school
and
there
is
a
vacancy
in
the
shop
they
want
a
boy
to
train
for
the
business
and
forrest
is
so
pleased
with
me
for
applying
that
he
is
going
to
start
me
at
once
i
saw
him
and
i
accepted
it
mother
subject
to
your
leave
which
of
course
you
will
give
forrest
said
it
would
do
him
a
lot
of
good
to
have
a
lad
like
me
about
the
place
and
young
forrest
himself
goes
to
one
of
the
universities
it
is
a
good
thing
for
me
mother
and
i
have
made
up
my
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
gilroy
s
face
looked
white
all
the
pleasure
had
left
it
she
glanced
at
parker
whose
eyes
twinkled
half
with
fun
and
half
with
sympathy
he
patted
llewellyn
again
on
the
shoulder
the
truth
now
he
said
you
are
too
proud
to
take
help
from
me
i
am
said
llewellyn
that
s
a
right
spirit
but
i
am
going
to
tempt
you
i
will
give
you
two
hundred
a
year
if
you
wish
to
go
to
no
thank
you
answered
the
boy
he
shook
the
kindly
hand
off
and
stepped
back
a
foot
but
why
my
lad
oh
llewellyn
why
said
the
mother
oh
llewellyn
are
you
mad
cried
leslie
i
will
tell
you
why
if
you
all
want
to
know
said
llewellyn
i
don
t
choose
to
be
beholden
to
anybody
not
even
to
parker
who
was
my
father
s
friend
i
may
some
day
go
to
the
university
but
i
don
t
think
there
is
much
chance
of
it
sir
i
will
tell
you
another
reason
i
want
to
help
my
mother
she
needs
help
at
once
she
could
take
it
from
me
when
she
could
not
take
it
from
a
stranger
if
i
went
to
oxford
i
could
not
earn
any
money
for
three
or
four
years
now
i
start
at
once
with
a
pound
a
week
i
can
live
at
home
too
and
half
the
money
will
go
straight
towards
the
house
in
a
year
s
time
my
screw
is
to
be
raised
it
is
all
settled
sir
i
am
obliged
to
you
all
the
same
but
i
can
t
take
your
as
llewellyn
finished
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
one
moment
please
interrupted
parker
i
respect
you
boy
shake
hands
if
i
had
had
a
son
of
my
own
i
could
only
wish
that
he
had
been
of
similar
metal
you
ll
do
young
ll
chapter
x
llewellyn
s
gift
late
that
evening
there
came
a
knock
at
llewellyn
s
door
he
called
out
come
in
and
his
sister
leslie
entered
she
shut
the
door
softly
behind
her
mother
is
asleep
she
said
and
i
think
she
has
been
sighs
so
heavily
in
her
sleep
it
is
not
like
her
i
would
not
wake
her
for
the
world
but
i
knew
you
would
be
up
lew
and
i
felt
that
i
must
have
a
talk
with
all
is
if
you
really
wish
it
said
llewellyn
slightly
stretching
himself
and
a
frown
coming
between
his
brows
he
had
been
bending
over
a
volume
of
plato
s
republic
and
some
sheets
of
manuscript
scribbled
over
as
if
in
frantic
haste
were
scattered
about
the
table
when
leslie
approached
he
pushed
the
manuscript
into
a
basket
and
shut
up
the
book
why
did
you
do
that
said
leslie
why
do
you
hide
your
real
thoughts
from
me
lew
don
t
you
want
me
to
know
we
have
always
been
more
than
ordinary
brother
and
sister
to
each
other
what
is
the
matter
with
you
still
llewellyn
did
not
reply
he
stood
up
and
looked
at
his
sister
with
as
expressionless
a
face
as
he
could
possibly
manage
to
assume
it
is
no
use
said
leslie
she
went
up
to
him
now
raised
herself
on
tiptoe
and
kissed
him
on
his
cheek
you
have
done
it
and
it
is
noble
of
you
it
is
splendid
of
you
but
how
can
you
ask
me
why
he
answered
can
t
you
guess
i
guess
partly
replied
the
girl
you
want
to
help
mother
but
surely
you
could
help
her
much
more
effectually
in
the
long
run
by
doing
what
parker
wishes
it
is
such
a
chance
and
it
was
put
in
your
way
lew
you
didn
t
go
out
of
your
way
to
seek
it
perhaps
god
meant
you
to
accept
no
don
t
cried
don
t
say
a
spasm
of
pain
flitted
across
the
boy
s
face
then
vanished
i
want
to
help
mother
and
i
will
he
said
stoutly
i
don
t
intend
her
to
do
all
the
toiling
and
any
longer
i
am
almost
a
man
leslie
i
shall
be
seventeen
my
next
birthday
oh
in
one
sense
it
is
young
but
it
is
not
young
with
me
for
i
think
i
am
older
than
my
years
i
won
t
see
her
grinding
without
putting
my
own
shoulder
to
the
wheel
it
s
just
intolerable
i
wish
you
would
listen
to
me
llewellyn
said
leslie
it
is
not
too
late
yet
the
chance
has
been
offered
to
you
and
the
chance
has
been
offered
to
me
it
seems
to
me
on
thinking
things
over
that
only
one
of
us
can
take
it
for
mother
can
t
do
without
both
of
that
s
just
what
i
said
interrupted
llewellyn
you
are
to
go
and
i
am
to
stay
it
is
all
arranged
don
t
like
a
dear
girl
worry
over
the
thing
any
longer
it
s
done
and
that
s
an
end
of
but
you
must
let
me
speak
said
leslie
i
can
never
go
to
wode
s
unless
i
make
a
clean
breast
of
all
that
is
in
my
mind
if
one
of
us
is
to
grind
for
the
present
ought
not
i
to
be
the
one
i
am
older
than
you
i
have
had
a
more
thorough
education
i
can
easily
get
a
position
as
junior
teacher
in
miss
harkaway
s
school
there
is
a
vacancy
and
she
has
half
promised
it
to
me
that
will
bring
me
in
thirty
pounds
a
year
and
my
food
and
after
a
bit
i
might
do
even
better
thus
i
should
be
altogether
off
mother
s
hands
and
could
even
help
her
a
trifle
then
lew
you
will
be
really
helping
her
at
oxford
as
you
are
acquiring
learning
and
as
those
magnificent
brains
of
yours
are
being
cultivated
to
their
full
worth
you
will
be
preparing
for
a
learned
profession
or
a
professorship
or
something
of
that
kind
surely
surely
that
would
be
a
more
substantial
help
to
the
sweetest
mother
in
the
world
than
your
earning
a
pound
a
week
now
at
lee
forrest
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
leslie
but
there
is
not
enough
in
it
said
llewellyn
quietly
believe
me
i
have
thought
of
all
this
from
every
point
of
view
in
the
first
place
professorships
do
not
mean
wealth
and
for
mother
s
sake
i
mean
to
be
a
wealthy
man
some
day
you
must
go
into
trade
to
be
wealthy
now
oh
it
is
not
that
i
care
for
money
not
a
bit
but
i
want
to
save
the
mother
to
keep
her
from
toiling
when
she
is
old
to
help
the
younger
children
i
can
t
stand
parker
doing
all
the
help
leslie
the
mere
thought
drives
me
half
wild
then
i
shall
not
always
work
at
a
pound
a
week
in
a
couple
of
years
i
may
be
earning
a
salary
of
two
hundred
a
year
for
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
that
young
forrest
has
taken
no
end
of
a
fancy
to
me
and
he
and
i
had
a
long
talk
he
took
me
up
to
see
his
father
and
his
father
would
do
anything
for
a
boy
jim
liked
jim
goes
to
oxford
in
the
autumn
he
hates
the
shop
and
he
won
t
go
into
business
for
he
can
t
stand
it
and
so
his
father
has
to
start
him
in
a
profession
but
he
hinted
very
so
did
the
old
man
too
for
that
if
i
could
take
his
place
it
would
put
matters
a
bit
right
and
smooth
down
the
pride
of
old
forrest
so
i
shall
have
my
chance
small
partnership
by
and
by
and
i
mean
to
take
it
little
girl
so
you
can
go
to
wingfield
with
a
heart
and
a
half
and
win
the
academic
honors
of
the
family
it
is
a
splendid
chance
for
you
leslie
and
i
m
not
the
fellow
to
stand
in
your
but
i
just
wish
you
would
she
cried
llewellyn
put
one
of
his
arms
round
her
and
drew
her
close
to
him
one
can
take
an
interest
in
anything
one
sets
one
s
mind
to
he
continued
i
shall
begin
double
entry
and
bookkeeping
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
the
classics
may
go
to
hong
kong
for
the
present
poor
old
plato
i
loved
him
and
i
had
dreams
about
him
but
he
and
i
must
be
strangers
for
the
present
you
think
me
silly
now
dear
but
you
won
t
when
i
have
succeeded
by
the
time
i
have
a
great
big
shop
of
my
own
you
will
think
me
the
wise
one
of
the
family
leslie
my
dear
what
is
wrong
for
leslie
had
squeezed
his
arm
so
tightly
that
the
lad
winced
i
can
t
bear
to
think
of
you
with
a
shop
she
cried
with
that
brain
and
those
eyes
and
oh
lew
don
t
you
remember
how
you
translated
thucydides
for
us
lew
it
can
t
be
it
must
be
borne
he
replied
stoutly
i
can
have
lessons
in
the
classics
if
i
have
time
enough
presently
oh
a
university
man
is
not
the
only
man
in
the
world
leslie
but
now
we
will
talk
no
more
of
this
once
for
all
my
mind
is
made
what
would
our
father
have
said
she
cried
our
father
who
was
a
great
scholar
if
he
were
to
come
back
and
if
he
could
speak
to
me
i
am
quite
certain
he
would
say
that
i
was
more
worthy
to
be
his
son
if
i
helped
the
mother
quickly
than
if
i
did
anything
else
replied
the
boy
perhaps
you
are
right
said
leslie
in
a
thoughtful
voice
llewellyn
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
i
don
t
pretend
all
the
same
that
it
s
not
been
no
end
of
a
tussle
he
said
but
now
my
mind
is
made
quite
yes
have
you
given
an
answer
yet
to
forrest
practically
i
have
but
the
mother
must
come
round
with
me
to
see
him
the
dear
little
mother
won
t
much
like
it
but
she
must
do
it
you
don
t
know
how
he
respects
her
i
should
think
so
said
leslie
that
goes
without
saying
she
is
quite
the
dearest
bravest
little
mother
in
the
wide
well
dry
your
tears
old
girl
i
ll
look
after
her
while
you
are
away
be
cheerful
leslie
and
get
all
the
good
you
can
out
of
this
magnificent
thing
for
i
don
t
pretend
that
it
s
not
a
great
bit
of
fortune
for
you
it
is
quite
possible
and
right
for
you
to
take
help
from
parker
but
i
could
not
do
it
it
s
not
in
me
to
take
favors
from
anyone
such
a
thing
would
lower
me
in
my
own
eyes
oh
it
does
not
lower
you
leslie
but
it
would
me
for
i
am
differently
made
we
must
each
walk
according
to
our
own
lights
and
now
go
to
bed
old
girl
for
i
am
half
dead
with
kiss
me
first
she
said
llewellyn
i
think
you
are
the
bravest
boy
in
all
the
you
would
not
say
so
if
you
had
seen
me
two
hours
back
i
was
so
miserable
i
felt
fit
to
kill
myself
but
there
he
added
clenching
one
of
his
strong
hands
i
did
not
mean
to
let
it
out
to
you
and
i
am
quite
right
now
and
i
don
t
feel
a
bit
leslie
left
the
room
and
llewellyn
was
alone
but
all
the
same
it
s
a
hard
tug
he
muttered
as
he
glanced
round
him
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
he
thought
of
the
dreams
which
must
never
be
realized
of
the
who
would
more
or
less
despise
him
of
the
different
position
he
must
occupy
in
future
literature
he
said
to
himself
the
laurels
which
would
have
been
so
sweet
to
gather
but
by
and
by
as
llewellyn
thought
he
raised
his
face
and
gazing
straight
before
him
he
saw
another
vision
and
that
vision
comforted
and
strengthened
him
a
good
bit
it
was
that
of
a
home
with
a
woman
in
it
who
wore
the
sweetest
face
in
the
world
and
who
was
not
tired
with
overwork
who
in
fact
need
not
work
at
all
he
saw
himself
as
the
one
who
was
keeping
that
home
with
his
toil
with
the
energy
of
his
strong
young
arms
with
the
youth
and
talents
which
god
had
given
him
he
was
supporting
his
mother
and
his
younger
brothers
and
sisters
and
they
all
looked
up
to
him
and
loved
him
and
his
heart
was
happy
the
thought
of
the
picture
made
his
heart
happy
even
now
he
smiled
dropped
on
his
knees
muttered
a
hasty
prayer
and
tumbling
into
bed
was
soon
fast
asleep
leslie
in
her
own
room
also
slept
and
bright
dreams
came
to
her
the
thought
of
the
future
was
delightful
and
she
looked
upon
it
as
llewellyn
s
gift
for
if
llewellyn
had
been
selfish
and
had
accepted
parker
s
offer
i
could
not
have
gone
thought
the
girl
i
could
not
have
left
mother
if
llewellyn
were
not
with
her
but
as
it
is
and
as
he
is
sacrificing
himself
oh
i
will
work
just
double
time
in
order
to
make
it
up
to
him
for
some
day
he
must
have
time
to
pursue
his
beloved
classics
and
his
literature
and
all
those
things
which
he
cares
for
no
girl
who
has
a
noble
brother
like
llewellyn
ought
to
shrink
at
anything
i
believe
i
am
the
happiest
and
i
know
i
am
the
proudest
girl
in
the
chapter
xi
wode
s
college
there
were
several
women
s
colleges
at
wingfield
but
the
largest
and
the
best
known
and
the
most
important
was
wode
s
it
stood
in
its
own
spacious
grounds
and
consisted
of
four
large
buildings
which
were
called
respectively
the
north
the
south
the
east
and
the
west
halls
there
was
also
an
extensive
library
standing
a
little
back
from
the
halls
of
residence
a
great
gymnasium
and
another
building
devoted
entirely
to
class
and
lecture
rooms
endless
money
had
been
spent
upon
wode
s
college
which
now
ranked
as
one
of
the
largest
and
most
important
colleges
for
women
in
the
whole
of
england
it
numbered
from
three
to
four
hundred
students
but
the
place
was
so
popular
the
system
on
which
everything
was
worked
was
so
admirable
that
girls
who
wished
to
go
to
wode
s
had
as
a
rule
to
put
down
their
names
a
couple
of
years
in
advance
it
so
happened
however
that
there
was
a
vacancy
for
two
sisters
at
west
hall
and
owing
to
the
of
a
highly
nervous
student
who
had
worked
too
hard
for
classical
honors
there
was
also
a
vacancy
in
the
north
hall
north
hall
was
the
house
of
residence
where
belle
acheson
carried
on
her
vagaries
and
pleased
herself
with
the
idea
that
she
was
one
of
the
cleverest
and
most
distinguished
girls
in
college
she
owned
to
a
qualm
of
disgust
however
when
she
learned
that
letitia
was
to
be
under
the
same
roof
as
herself
having
a
thorough
scorn
for
that
young
lady
but
as
she
was
allowed
no
choice
in
the
matter
she
felt
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit
to
the
inevitable
parker
had
himself
visited
wode
s
college
had
seen
the
principal
miss
lauderdale
and
had
pleaded
the
cause
of
leslie
gilroy
with
such
passion
and
effect
that
special
arrangements
had
been
made
in
her
favor
and
she
was
admitted
to
the
same
hall
as
marjorie
and
eileen
for
the
first
term
she
must
share
a
large
room
with
another
girl
but
that
was
a
trifling
matter
to
leslie
who
now
that
things
were
thoroughly
arranged
wished
to
start
on
her
new
career
without
a
moment
s
delay
as
she
had
already
passed
the
london
matriculation
there
was
no
difficulty
about
her
admission
as
soon
as
room
could
be
found
for
her
this
being
arranged
she
was
able
to
go
to
wode
s
at
the
beginning
of
trinity
term
it
so
happened
therefore
that
letitia
eileen
marjorie
and
leslie
gilroy
all
found
themselves
on
a
certain
afternoon
in
the
same
cab
driving
to
wode
s
from
the
railway
station
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
the
girls
luggage
was
to
follow
them
and
as
there
happened
to
be
a
place
in
the
cab
for
a
fourth
and
leslie
was
standing
looking
just
a
little
forlorn
on
the
platform
marjorie
went
up
to
her
and
suggested
that
they
should
all
go
together
for
i
know
you
are
a
wode
s
girl
she
said
how
could
you
possibly
guess
that
replied
leslie
looking
with
admiration
at
marjorie
whose
plain
dress
could
never
take
away
from
the
charm
of
her
handsome
face
there
was
really
no
mystery
about
said
marjorie
after
a
pause
i
am
not
a
magician
but
i
happened
to
see
the
name
of
wode
s
on
that
a
minute
or
two
ago
will
you
come
with
us
i
shall
be
only
too
delighted
was
the
reply
i
was
feeling
quite
lost
and
strange
it
would
be
nice
to
go
to
college
in
company
is
this
your
first
term
she
added
as
she
seated
herself
in
the
cab
yes
yes
we
are
all
freshers
replied
lettie
we
shall
all
have
a
most
unenviable
position
that
i
can
foretell
there
is
a
certain
miss
acheson
who
resides
in
north
hall
who
has
told
us
of
some
of
the
discomforts
and
for
my
part
if
i
had
not
oh
hush
please
lettie
don
t
say
any
more
said
eileen
you
need
not
begin
by
frightening
miss
gilroy
you
look
miss
gilroy
as
if
you
intended
to
have
a
good
leslie
did
not
reply
except
with
her
eyes
which
were
smiling
she
was
looking
her
best
dressed
neatly
and
suitably
with
her
white
sailor
hat
making
an
effective
contrast
to
the
meshes
of
her
bright
golden
hair
well
i
do
wonder
how
everything
will
turn
out
said
eileen
by
the
way
miss
gilroy
you
did
not
tell
us
which
hall
you
were
going
to
i
believe
i
am
to
share
a
room
with
another
student
at
north
hall
she
answered
then
she
continued
the
smiles
which
she
could
not
suppress
now
visiting
her
eyes
is
not
the
whole
scheme
delightful
i
do
wonder
what
the
other
students
will
be
and
what
the
tutors
will
be
like
continued
marjorie
eagerly
there
are
two
resident
tutors
in
each
house
and
also
a
miss
lauderdale
is
of
course
the
principal
over
the
entire
college
i
expect
i
shall
be
somewhat
afraid
of
i
don
t
intend
to
be
afraid
of
anyone
said
eileen
when
one
makes
up
one
s
mind
to
lead
a
really
useful
life
surely
small
matters
such
as
little
nervousnesses
ought
not
to
leslie
gazed
hard
at
eileen
as
if
she
would
read
her
through
marjorie
bent
suddenly
forward
and
laid
her
hand
on
leslie
s
knee
will
you
tell
me
something
she
asked
earnestly
are
you
coming
to
wode
s
to
be
a
useful
member
of
society
or
a
learned
or
an
ornamental
one
i
have
not
thought
of
it
in
that
light
said
leslie
i
want
to
go
in
for
learning
of
course
as
to
being
ornamental
i
have
no
time
to
think
about
that
and
i
hope
that
learned
and
useful
will
in
my
case
go
together
i
have
a
great
deal
to
do
during
the
three
years
which
are
before
delightful
three
years
i
have
no
doubt
they
will
prove
what
special
subjects
do
you
mean
to
take
up
chetwynd
is
my
name
said
eileen
but
i
hope
you
won
t
call
me
it
i
am
sure
we
shall
be
friends
more
particularly
as
we
are
to
start
our
new
life
in
the
same
hall
oh
i
shall
have
much
to
tell
you
by
and
by
lettie
why
is
that
frown
between
your
brows
i
did
not
know
that
i
was
frowning
answered
letitia
i
was
only
thinking
of
the
ornamental
part
of
life
and
how
i
could
carry
it
out
most
letitia
was
dressed
with
special
care
not
unsuitably
for
she
had
too
good
taste
for
that
but
so
daintily
so
exquisitely
with
such
a
careful
eye
to
the
smallest
details
that
marjorie
and
eileen
looked
rough
and
gauche
beside
her
their
serge
skirts
had
been
made
by
a
as
nothing
would
induce
them
to
waste
money
on
a
dressmaker
the
had
been
discovered
by
eileen
in
fox
buildings
she
had
a
lame
knee
and
a
sick
brother
and
eileen
seized
upon
her
at
once
as
a
suitable
person
for
the
job
as
she
expressed
it
finally
she
was
given
most
of
the
girls
outfits
to
undertake
she
worked
neatly
but
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
fitting
with
numberless
blouses
however
and
a
couple
of
serge
skirts
and
sailor
hats
though
cheap
at
least
looking
clean
the
girls
passed
muster
and
were
totally
indifferent
to
their
own
appearance
when
once
we
have
plunged
into
our
new
work
we
shall
be
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
said
eileen
i
wonder
if
belle
arrived
yesterday
or
i
sincerely
trust
she
won
t
come
till
said
letitia
with
a
shudder
i
do
not
know
for
what
sin
i
am
doomed
to
reside
under
the
same
roof
with
that
terrible
a
terrible
girl
who
can
she
be
asked
leslie
you
will
know
for
yourself
before
you
have
been
many
days
at
wode
s
was
lettie
s
enigmatical
reply
oh
and
here
we
are
turning
in
at
the
gates
my
heart
does
go
leslie
s
face
also
became
suffused
with
pink
as
the
cabman
drew
up
at
the
large
wooden
gates
which
were
presently
opened
by
a
neatly
dressed
young
woman
who
lived
at
the
lodge
just
within
the
grounds
were
of
a
mile
in
length
and
the
four
halls
built
round
a
quadrangle
stood
in
the
middle
there
was
a
wide
and
smoothly
kept
grass
lawn
in
front
of
the
halls
and
a
gravel
sweep
going
right
round
them
the
cab
presently
delivered
up
its
four
occupants
and
eileen
marjorie
and
leslie
found
themselves
in
a
small
waiting
room
inside
west
hall
where
they
were
to
remain
until
the
housekeeper
could
arrive
to
take
them
to
their
several
rooms
they
had
not
to
wait
long
a
cheery
young
woman
of
about
presently
made
her
appearance
asked
them
their
names
told
them
that
their
trunks
would
be
brought
to
their
rooms
as
soon
as
ever
they
arrived
and
then
requested
them
to
follow
her
she
tripped
up
some
wide
stone
stairs
destitute
of
carpets
and
then
down
a
corridor
slippery
with
parquetry
work
the
next
moment
she
had
flung
open
a
door
and
revealed
a
room
which
was
occupied
by
another
girl
at
the
farther
end
who
wore
a
shock
of
red
hair
rather
untidily
put
up
in
a
loose
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
miss
colchester
i
see
you
have
arrived
said
miss
payne
the
housekeeper
this
is
your
may
i
introduce
you
to
miss
leslie
gilroy
pray
come
in
miss
gilroy
you
are
heartily
welcome
said
miss
colchester
jumping
up
coming
forward
and
gazing
hard
at
leslie
she
then
extended
an
awkward
hand
i
am
glad
to
see
you
she
said
i
hope
you
don
t
mind
the
room
being
in
disorder
i
have
only
just
begun
to
unpack
and
everything
is
i
was
never
never
i
begin
to
think
i
like
things
oh
i
don
t
mind
of
course
answered
leslie
but
her
heart
sank
in
her
mother
s
small
house
the
motto
impressed
upon
each
child
was
the
one
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
i
suppose
i
shall
have
one
side
of
the
room
to
myself
she
continued
marjorie
and
eileen
had
been
left
on
the
landing
they
overheard
leslie
s
last
somewhat
despairing
words
glanced
at
one
another
and
smiled
they
were
then
conducted
to
their
rooms
at
the
farther
end
of
the
corridor
this
is
your
room
miss
eileen
said
miss
payne
miss
marjorie
has
an
exact
counterpart
at
the
other
side
of
the
corridor
behind
this
screen
you
will
keep
your
this
sofa
forms
your
bed
at
night
this
chest
of
drawers
is
for
your
linen
and
the
bodice
of
your
dresses
behind
this

you
will
hang
your
skirts
here
is
your
it
remains
with
yourself
to
make
your
room
pretty
and
neat
or
the
reverse
you
may
buy
any
ornaments
in
the
way
of
pictures
or
anything
else
you
fancy
when
you
touch
this
handle
you
turn
on
the
electric
light
would
you
care
for
a
fire
here
are
coal
and
wood
for
the
purpose
and
i
will
send
in
a
servant
to
light
it
at
once
if
you
no
thank
you
it
is
quite
a
warm
evening
replied
eileen
is
marjorie
s
room
just
the
same
precisely
but
i
think
you
have
the
prettier
oh
how
lovely
exclaimed
eileen
do
look
marjorie
there
is
that
great
park
in
the
distance
and
the
river
down
there
oh
she
turned
to
speak
to
miss
payne
but
miss
payne
had
already
vanished
well
we
are
landed
at
last
she
said
clasping
her
sister
s
hand
does
it
not
seem
almost
too
delightful
splendid
cried
marjorie
do
you
know
eileen
i
have
taken
a
fancy
to
that
pretty
miss
gilroy
so
have
i
answered
marjorie
but
i
expect
she
will
have
a
bad
time
poor
dear
with
miss
colchester
anyone
can
see
miss
gilroy
is
of
the
orderly
sort
now
i
don
t
care
a
bit
about
having
things
in
perfect
but
marjorie
said
eileen
i
have
been
reading
up
about
that
lately
and
i
think
you
and
i
ought
to
cultivate
order
very
assiduously
if
we
mean
to
be
really
useful
women
oh
by
the
way
our
hair
is
beginning
to
grow
we
must
find
a
barber
in
order
to
reduce
our
crops
to
the
right
an
inch
and
a
half
being
the
length
permitted
said
marjorie
with
a
smile
i
am
curious
to
see
poor
old
belle
lettie
will
have
awful
tales
to
tell
of
her
well
this
life
is
interesting
is
it
not
eileen
chapter
xii
inky
annie
meanwhile
miss
colchester
and
leslie
gilroy
standing
in
the
middle
of
their
room
gazed
one
at
the
other
miss
colchester
put
up
her
hand
to
ruffle
her
red
locks
presently
she
uttered
a
short
sharp
sigh
i
see
by
the
build
of
your
head
and
your
figure
that
you
are
painfully
tidy
she
said
i
had
hoped
that
it
might
have
been
the
will
of
providence
to
allow
a
congenial
spirit
to
share
this
room
with
me
but
evidently
that
is
not
to
be
my
lot
how
much
space
do
you
require
half
the
room
i
suppose
said
leslie
half
my
dear
good
creature
impossible
don
t
you
see
that
my
things
are
everywhere
you
will
notice
too
that
i
am
absorbed
in
study
i
am
working
hard
for
mathematical
honors
and
i
have
only
this
term
in
which
to
surely
a
long
time
said
leslie
no
time
at
all
i
assure
you
come
here
i
will
show
you
the
list
of
books
i
have
to
get
through
oh
i
declare
here
comes
your
trunks
what
do
you
want
two
trunks
for
how
perfectly
fearful
put
them
down
please
near
the
door
now
then
we
had
better
settle
this
matter
at
once
you
must
promise
that
you
will
on
no
account
encroach
on
my
half
of
the
room
i
take
this
side
with
the
bay
window
you
have
the
back
with
the
little
side
window
i
require
light
for
my
work
i
give
you
permission
to
keep
your
part
just
there
in
the
corner
as
tidy
as
you
please
do
you
understand
i
shall
certainly
keep
my
part
of
the
room
tidy
said
leslie
with
some
spirit
and
may
i
ask
what
this
screen
is
for
oh
you
can
use
it
or
not
as
you
please
it
is
supposed
to
hide
the
most
unnecessary
in
my
opinion
some
of
the
students
here
even
go
the
length
of
turning
the
chest
of
drawers
so
that
the
drawers
may
face
the
wall
then
they
put
an
ornamental
sort
of
over
the
back
of
the
drawers
and
make
it
look
like
a
piece
of
ornamental
furniture
ornamental
instead
of
useful
ridiculous
does
not
one
want
to
bang
open
a
drawer
stuff
in
one
s
things
shut
it
again
as
quickly
as
possible
and
then
not
give
another
thought
to
the
matter
surely
there
are
untidy
girls
in
the
college
why
was
it
my
lot
to
have
you
sent
to
share
my
who
are
the
very
pink
of
neatness
i
see
you
are
very
sorry
to
have
me
and
of
course
i
am
sorry
too
that
you
should
be
put
out
said
leslie
who
thought
it
best
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
but
suppose
miss
i
who
may
not
have
quite
so
much
work
to
do
at
present
as
you
of
course
you
won
t
you
silly
girl
i
am
working
for
honors
i
told
well
well
do
let
me
finish
suppose
i
undertake
the
tidying
of
the
whole
room
but
my
dear
good
creature
i
like
it
untidy
i
hate
to
have
everything
in
its
place
when
things
are
in
their
right
places
they
can
never
be
found
that
s
my
opinion
do
you
see
my
study
table
i
know
exactly
where
i
have
put
my
things
but
if
anybody
attempts
to
tidy
them
woe
betide
my
comfort
in
the
future
well
i
see
you
are
and
i
don
t
want
to
be
disagreeable
you
have
a
nice
face
too
and
i
dare
say
we
shall
pull
together
all
right
if
you
wish
to
tidy
just
round
my
table
you
may
for
instance
if
you
see
my
stockings
on
the
floor
you
can
roll
them
up
and
pop
them
into
my
drawer
any
drawer
it
doesn
t
matter
which
and
if
i
do
forget
to
put
my
boots
outside
at
night
you
may
gather
them
up
with
your
own
and
fling
them
on
the
landing
oh
dear
dear
it
is
such
a
worry
even
to
speak
about
it
but
what
i
was
about
to
say
continued
miss
colchester
is
this
you
may
tidy
for
me
if
you
please
but
there
is
one
point
on
which
i
am
resolved
this
table
is
never
to
be
touched
the
housemaid
knows
it
and
now
i
warn
you
think
what
it
means
to
may
make
a
note
through
my
brain
may
be
evolved
an
idea
which
a
careless
housemaid
may
throw
into
the
basket
just
think
what
it
would
mean
how
do
you
suppose
i
am
to
work
in
a
place
like
this
if
i
think
of
small
petty
things
which
occupy
you
are
a
have
you
a
tidy
mother
of
course
you
yes
said
leslie
and
a
very
and
clever
mother
too
she
spends
a
great
deal
of
her
time
out
but
she
has
trained
my
sisters
and
i
do
believe
you
are
going
to
quote
that
awful
proverb
about
a
place
for
everything
said
miss
colchester
don
t
i
beg
of
i
was
thinking
of
it
i
did
not
mean
to
quote
it
said
leslie
well
i
must
not
waste
any
more
time
talking
i
suppose
you
must
have
your
way
i
am
afraid
your
bedstead
is
a
little
uncomfortable
the
spring
is
broken
but
you
don
t
mind
do
you
i
do
mind
answered
leslie
i
shall
ask
to
have
the
spring
mended
there
is
no
good
in
having
an
uncomfortable
bed
but
for
it
does
not
oh
i
see
you
are
going
to
be
that
is
your
can
take
the
best
of
the
two
because
i
never
open
mine
you
can
paste
any
pictures
you
like
on
it
if
you
are
given
that
way
but
i
hope
to
goodness
you
are
not
the
screen
is
to
put
round
your
that
is
your
table
and
that
is
your
chest
of
drawers
now
for
goodness
sake
like
a
dear
good
creature
put
your
things
in
order
and
don
t
speak
to
me
again
i
must
go
on
with
my
calculus
of
finite
what
do
you
mean
asked
leslie
do
you
wish
for
an
explanation
if
so
pray
sit
down
opposite
to
me
and
don
t
expect
to
stir
for
a
week
it
will
take
me
at
least
as
long
to
explain
the
matter
oh
don
t
say
any
more
just
now
and
do
move
as
softly
as
you
can
do
just
consider
that
my
winning
honors
in
mathematics
is
a
little
more
important
than
that
your
drawers
should
be
in
immaculate
order
do
you
comprehend
well
don
t
say
another
the
maiden
returned
to
her
desk
stuffed
both
her
hands
through
her
fiery
locks
which
stuck
out
now
like
great
wings
on
each
side
of
her
head
and
began
murmuring
slowly
to
herself
leslie
stood
still
for
a
moment
with
a
sense
of
dismay
stealing
over
her
what
is
to
be
done
she
thought
miss
colchester
is
a
very
peculiar
girl
what
does
a
calculus
of
finite
differences
mean
i
almost
wish
dear
old
lew
had
been
mathematical
then
perhaps
i
should
have
known
well
never
mind
i
won
t
disturb
that
poor
dear
scholarly
girl
but
unpack
my
things
i
simply
thanks
to
her
mother
s
excellent
training
leslie
was
a
proficient
in
the
art
of
stowing
away
things
in
small
spaces
and
before
the
gong
for
dinner
sounded
she
had
put
all
her
belongings
away
had
arranged
the
screen
round
her
and
had
even
brought
out
photographs
of
her
mother
and
her
brother
llewellyn
to
ornament
the
top
of
her
chest
of
drawers
these
gave
a
home
look
to
the
room
and
she
glanced
at
them
with
satisfaction
her
bedstead
turned
into
a
sofa
by
day
by
means
of
a
crimson
rug
was
now
tidy
and
in
order
and
leslie
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
it
waiting
for
annie
colchester
to
stir
the
second
gong
pealed
through
the
house
and
annie
suddenly
started
to
her
feet
good
gracious
oh
i
forgot
all
about
you
what
is
your
name
leslie
leslie
gilroy
please
tell
me
if
that
is
the
first
or
second
gong
the
second
replied
leslie
and
who
are
you
continued
annie
colchester
gazing
in
a
sort
of
vacant
way
at
her
roomfellow
the
girl
who
has
come
to
share
your
and
you
have
put
all
your
things
away
and
made
no
noise
excellent
did
you
say
that
that
was
the
second
gong
leslie
gilroy
is
my
is
that
the
second
gong
the
second
gong
sounded
two
or
three
minutes
then
we
must
fly
oh
never
mind
our
hands
ink
yes
i
have
ink
on
my
hands
and
on
my
face
and
on
my
hair
but
never
mind
never
mind
they
know
me
now
i
am
called
inky
i
rather
glory
in
the
but
i
should
have
thought
that
a
mathematical
scholar
would
have
been
the
essence
of
order
said
leslie
surely
mathematics
ought
to
conduce
to
order
of
mind
and
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
said
annie
casting
a
withering
glance
at
leslie
i
wonder
if
you
are
clever
or
what
you
have
come
here
for
girls
who
are
merely
orderly
have
no
niche
at
wode
s
but
you
will
learn
doubtless
and
if
you
are
i
will
stick
up
for
you
of
course
come
along
now
you
are
a
fresher
you
know
this
term
and
will
be
treated
but
how
are
freshers
treated
and
why
must
i
be
given
that
unpleasant
name
asked
leslie
custom
my
we
always
call
the
new
girls
freshers
you
ll
get
used
to
it
no
one
is
unkind
to
a
fresher
unless
she
makes
herself
disagreeable
which
i
rather
guess
you
won
here
annie
smiled
brightly
into
leslie
s
face
well
i
hope
we
shall
be
good
friends
and
that
i
won
t
inconvenience
you
said
the
other
girl
you
won
t
if
you
are
silent
and
keep
to
your
side
of
the
room
now
then
let
s
join
hands
and
fly
oh
yes
we
are
fearfully
late
and
the
others
have
gone
into
the
dining
well
come
this
way
said
annie
i
ll
squeeze
you
into
a
seat
by
me
if
you
like
for
this
evening
leslie
chapter
xiii
a
cocoa
party
nearly
one
hundred
girls
were
in
the
great
dining
hall
they
were
all
seated
at
the
different
tables
when
annie
colchester
and
leslie
gilroy
appeared
annie
went
straight
up
to
her
own
table
bowed
somewhat
awkwardly
to
miss
frere
the
tutor
who
was
at
the
head
and
then
seeing
that
the
teacher
s
eyes
were
fixed
on
leslie
said
in
an
abrupt
voice
this
is
my
roomfellow
miss
leslie
gilroy
miss
how
do
you
do
miss
gilroy
said
miss
frere
in
a
pleasant
voice
i
think
you
will
find
a
seat
next
to
miss
colchester
move
down
a
little
please
jane
she
continued
turning
to
another
girl
with
a
rosy
face
and
dark
eyes
yes
there
is
plenty
of
room
now
i
will
have
a
talk
with
you
after
dinner
if
you
like
miss
thank
you
i
shall
be
very
glad
replied
leslie
her
bright
eyes
and
lovely
face
her
whole
manner
and
pleasant
expression
made
many
of
the
girls
turn
and
glance
at
her
but
nobody
stared
in
at
all
an
unpleasant
manner
the
girl
called
jane
began
to
talk
to
leslie
and
told
her
some
of
the
rules
of
the
place
leslie
was
glad
to
learn
what
she
could
but
her
eyes
anxiously
glanced
from
table
to
table
in
the
hope
of
once
more
seeing
her
two
companions
of
the
cab
presently
she
observed
marjorie
and
eileen
seated
at
a
table
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
they
were
together
looking
already
quite
at
home
and
perfectly
contented
they
talked
to
one
another
when
they
caught
leslie
s
eyes
they
nodded
to
her
in
a
pleasant
manner
who
are
those
two
girls
said
jane
heriot
suddenly
they
are
freshers
like
yourself
are
they
not
i
do
not
know
much
about
them
replied
leslie
yes
they
have
just
come
to
wode
names
are
marjorie
and
eileen
chetwynd
they
were
kind
enough
to
share
a
cab
with
me
coming
from
the
station
and
seem
to
be
very
nice
girls
i
like
their
faces
said
miss
heriot
but
what
a
funny
way
they
do
their
hair
i
don
t
care
for
that
short
hair
do
you
not
personally
replied
leslie
but
they
seem
nice
girls
and
have
handsome
yes
i
am
sure
they
are
charming
and
also
out
of
the
common
i
only
trust
they
won
t
join
the
oddities
we
have
a
few
oddities
here
of
course
i
am
so
glad
you
are
not
going
to
be
as
jane
spoke
she
glanced
toward
annie
colchester
who
looked
back
at
her
and
nodded
i
overheard
you
jane
she
said
and
you
are
perfectly
welcome
to
speak
of
me
as
the
oddity
of
all
oddities
miss
leslie
gilroy
has
found
out
that
fact
for
herself
already
have
you
not
miss
gilroy
i
have
found
you
quite
willing
to
put
up
with
the
discomfort
of
having
me
in
your
room
answered
leslie
coloring
as
she
spoke
you
are
sure
to
have
a
room
to
yourself
after
this
term
said
jane
heriot
this
is
always
our
most
crowded
term
but
if
annie
takes
honors
which
she
is
very
likely
to
do
she
will
be
leaving
wode
s
and
then
the
governors
will
give
you
another
the
dinner
proceeded
leslie
asked
a
few
more
questions
of
jane
who
always
replied
in
a
pleasant
intelligent
manner
and
when
the
meal
had
come
to
an
end
she
asked
leslie
if
she
would
like
to
come
with
her
to
her
own
room
this
is
our
debate
evening
she
said
i
will
bring
you
down
to
the
hall
presently
and
introduce
you
to
several
of
the
girls
but
now
do
come
down
to
my
room
and
have
a
chat
we
don
t
debate
before
eight
i
am
sure
we
shall
be
but
miss
frere
said
something
about
wishing
to
see
me
after
dinner
said
leslie
she
is
one
of
the
tutors
is
she
not
oh
yes
such
a
darling
the
dearest
sweetest
woman
on
earth
but
surely
you
don
t
want
to
talk
over
books
yes
i
do
i
should
like
to

up
the

where

a
number
of

debate

and

how
far
you
are
likely
to
enjoy
yourself
amongst
with
so
many
temptations
i
think
i
will
wait
to
be
introduced
to
miss
maple
until
said
leslie
i
think

frere

jane

since

not
to
go
to
her
said
leslie
she
may
think
it
rude

jane
with
a
laugh

it
rude
to
be
left
alone
she
is
hard
at
work
at
her
studies
already
let
me
tell
you
you
will
be
in
luck
if

into
that
room
at
all
for
one
of
her
unpleasant
habits

to
lock
the
door
then
she
goes
to
bed
without
thinking
anything
more
about
it
alice
hall
her
last
roomfellow
was
once
kept
out
of
the
room
all
night
in
consequence
of
annie
s
behavior
poor
alice
had
to
share
my
and
i
assure
you
it
was
a
tight
in
that
case
would
it
not
be
wise
for
me
to
run
up
immediately
and
remove
the
key
jane
heriot
laughed
again
excellent
she
said
and
annie
will
never
miss
it
she
is
the
most
eccentric
creature
i
ever

too
wonderful
we
all
laugh
at
her
but
we
all
like
her
for
she

a
good
old
thing

such
an
oddity
well
i

same
corridor

two
or
three
friends
who
are
certain
to
come
and
see
me
and
i
should
like
to
introduce
you
to
just
as
the
two
girls
were
about
to
ascend
the
stairs
they
met
eileen
and
marjorie
who
arm
in
arm
were
looking
at
the
regulation
board
as
soon
as
they
saw
leslie
they
turned
to
speak
to
her
i
hope
you
are
comfortable
miss
gilroy
said
marjorie
we
please
introduce
me
miss
gilroy
said
jane
heriot
touching
leslie
on
her
sleeve
leslie
did
what
was
required
you
don
t
know
anybody
here
yet
do
you
asked
jane
turning
to
eileen
no
replied
eileen
one
or
two
girls
spoke
to
us
at
dinner
in
that
case
you
had
better
come
and
join
my
party
said
jane
the
girls
will
call
on
you
evening
so
you
must
be
at
home
but
they
will
not
do
so
as
it
is
the
first
night
of
term
do
come
both
of
you
miss
gilroy
is
coming
and
we
shall
make
quite
a
cozy
eileen
and
marjorie
said
they
would
be
delighted
to
comply
and
the
girls
went
upstairs
side
by
side
leslie
went
to
her
own
room
secured
the
key
slipped
it
into
her
pocket
and
joined
the
rest
on
the
threshold
of
jane
s
room
jane
heriot
happened
to
have
one
of
the
prettiest
and
most
tastefully
arranged
rooms
in
north
hall
it
was
a
corner
room
and
had
queer
little
nooks
and
crannies
in
all
sorts
of
unexpected
places
it
was
papered
with
a
very
artistic
paper
and
had
a
deep
dado
which
jane
herself
had
painted
with
a
running
pattern
of
wild
flowers
and
birds
some
good
photogravures
of
pictures
by
and
watts
hung
upon
the
walls
the
curtains
were
of
liberty
silk
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
drugget
the
bed
was
turned
into
a
tastefully
arranged
sofa
and
the
chest
of
drawers
was
rendered
unique
and
graceful
by
a
piano
cloth
concealing
its
back
the
screen
which
hid
the
washing
apparatus
was
a
liberty
one
and
very
pretty
a
bright
little
fire
burned
in
the
grate
which
was
agreeable
as
the
evening
was
somewhat
chilly
one
of
the
windows
stood
slightly
open
and
the
room
was
full
of
fresh
air
without
draught
we
must
all
go
down
to
debate
within
an
hour
said
jane
and
then
i
hope
you
will
return
to
my
room
girls
for
cocoa
i
am
giving
a
cocoa
party
you
how
delightful
said
leslie
how
pleasant
everything
seems
to
be
when
did
you
say
the
debate
would
begin
asked
eileen
within
an
then
you
have
time
first
to
tell
us
something
of
your
college
i
can
do
so
if
you
like
we
have
a
great
deal
of
liberty
here
and
provided
we
don
t
break
the
rules
we
are
not
likely
to
get
into
hot
water
the
studious
girls
work
as
a
rule
in
the
morning
play
games
in
the
afternoon
and
work
again
after
dinner
until
whatever
hour
they
wish
to
go
to
bed
we
are
all
expected
to
be
in
bed
soon
after
midnight
and
no
one
is
allowed
to
be
outside
the
gates
after
ten
unless
special
leave
is
given
by
the
way
do
you
know
any
people
in
wingfield
miss
gilroy
i
have
an
introduction
to
one
of
the
dons
matcheson
said
leslie
but
i
don
t
know
him
oh
you
are
in
great
luck
if
you
get
into
the
matcheson
set
said
jane
with
a
slight
look
of
envy
flitting
across
her
face
they
are
some
of
the
nicest
people
in
wingfield
and
they
have
such
delightful
sunday
evenings
they
are
sure
to
invite
you
to
them
do
you
know
any
people
miss
chetwynd
not
a
soul
said
marjorie
sinking
down
upon
a
corner
of
jane
s
sofa
and
i
am
not
likely
to
she
added
for
when
once
we
take
up
our
work
in
earnest
we
shall
have
no
time
for
social
social
frivolities
repeated
jane
but
half
the
good
of
the
place
is
its
social
life
you
won
t
get
the
benefit
you
ought
to
derive
from
a
residence
at
wode
s
unless
you
take
up
the
social
as
well
as
the
learned
side
of
the
i
don
t
understand
you
said
marjorie
knitting
her
pretty
brows
i
must
try
and
explain
i
see
by
miss
gilroy
s
face
that
she
leslie
nodded
and
smiled
one
of
the
many
benefits
of
coming
to
college
is
to
strengthen
the
social
side
of
one
s
character
said
jane
when
miss
frere
or
miss
maple
ask
you
to
tea
they
will
discourse
much
on
that
point
a
college
girl
ought
to
have
wider
sympathies
and
to
be
less
selfish
all
round
than
a
girl
who
knows
only
the
ordinary
home
life
oh
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
against
home
girls
but
certainly
college
life
does
strengthen
one
now
here
we
have
heaps
of
opportunities
we
know
so
many
girls
we
enter
into
their
lives
we
have
a
delightful
feeling
of
comradeship
the
wide
outside
world
which
we
get
a
glimpse
of
from
our
own
dear
little
paradise
is
most
strengthening
to
our
characters
you
ask
some
of
the
older
girls
here
what
they
think
of
wode
s
they
will
tell
you
that
it
is
a
paradise
an
oasis
we
are
all
happy
devoid
of
care
and
the
hockey
and
tennis
clubs
and
the
boating
are
all
so
charming
that
we
can
not
but
have
a
gay
time
there
are
twenty
boats
belonging
to
wode
s
college
and
on
the
long
summer
afternoons
we
go
up
the
river
a
good
distance
and
very
often
do
our
work
under
the
trees
so
you
can
imagine
how
jolly
everything
is
but
of
course
there
are
certain
rules
no
girl
can
belong
to
the
boating
club
for
instance
unless
she
can
swim
in
fifty
feet
of
i
can
stand
that
test
said
marjorie
eagerly
and
i
should
rather
like
to
be
in
a
boat
eileen
and
i
have
rowed
a
good
deal
on
the
sea
since
we
were
quite
can
you
swim
miss
gilroy
asked
jane
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
replied
leslie
but
i
don
t
think
i
am
much
of
a
coward
and
can
soon
learn
she
added
you
see
i
have
spent
all
my
life
in
london
and
have
not
had
a
chance
of
oh
if
you
are
a
london
girl
you
ought
to
have
courage
for
anything
then
besides
the
boating
club
we
have
our
bicycle
clubs
and
our
debating
society
and
our
dramatic
society
oh
yes
it
is
a
very
full
life
and
those
derive
most
benefit
from
the
college
who
enter
into
it
in
its
divers
branches
as
much
as
all
that
social
frivolity
will
not
suit
me
said
marjorie
breaking
the
silence
that
followed
jane
s
rapid
flow
of
words
why
so
because
my
sister
and
am
sure
i
can
speak
for
her
as
well
as
come
here
for
a
definite
purpose
if
we
had
stayed
at
home
we
should
have
gone
in
for
all
those
other
things
we
know
a
very
earnest
student
who
belongs
to
this
college
and
she
has
given
us
quite
different
particulars
with
regard
to
the
life
she
did
not
speak
of
it
as
you
have
done
miss
may
i
know
the
name
of
that
girl
asked
jane
certainly
you
may
she
is
a
great
friend
of
ours
i
believe
her
room
is
in
west
hall
her
name
is
belle
a
queer
convulsed
sort
of
look
passed
over
jane
s
face
for
a
quarter
of
a
second
then
vanished
she
looked
solemnly
at
eileen
are
you
a
great
friend
of
miss
acheson
s
she
asked
certainly
we
have
known
her
since
we
were
children
but
why
do
you
inquire
i
am
is
all
said
jane
sorry
what
can
you
mean
do
you
know
her
we
all
know
her
more
or
less
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
her
personally
except
that
she
does
not
take
the
best
the
college
affords
i
hope
you
will
but
forgive
me
i
am
a
stranger
to
you
i
ought
not
to
it
would
certainly
be
better
for
you
to
say
nothing
more
said
marjorie
in
her
gentle
voice
belle
is
a
friend
of
ours
yes
she
continued
we
have
come
here
to
learn
and
we
don
t
wish
to
be
but
we
are
quite
determined
that
we
will
not
waste
our
time
nor
our
money
in
dress
or
here
she
glanced
disapprovingly
round
the
exquisitely
furnished
little
room
we
mean
to
work
hard
we
shall
have
no
time
for
jane
muttered
something
under
her
breath
then
she
said
cheerfully
i
am
not
the
one
to
lecture
you
come
what
shall
i
show
you
it
will
soon
be
time
to
go
down
to
hall
to
the
debate
now
how
can
i
amuse
you
we
don
t
want
amusing
said
eileen
that
s
just
the
very
point
we
wish
you
to
clearly
understand
if
you
can
tell
us
anything
about
the
poor
in
wingfield
or
what
philanthropic
societies
are
started
or
if
there
are
classes
for
the
teaching
of
cookery
and
domestic
economy
we
shall
be
greatly
obliged
to
but
why
did
you
come
here
said
jane
opening
her
eyes
wide
this
is
a
place
for
the
acquiring
of
academic
learning
not
it
is
the
place
where
belle
acheson
is
acquiring
her
profound
knowledge
of
life
said
marjorie
in
a
slow
voice
jane
looked
at
her
with
a
puzzled
expression
just
then
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
and
two
girls
named
alice
and
florrie
smart
put
in
an
appearance
they
were
fashionably
dressed
and
rushed
up
to
jane
and
kissed
her
dear
old
janie
how
are
you
said
alice
oh
we
have
had
such
a
jolly
time
interrupted
florrie
we
were
out
with
the
davidsons
all
the
afternoon
and
thought
we
should
be
late
we
wouldn
t
miss
the
debate
for
a
thousand
worlds
freshers
do
i
see
freshers
here
pray
introduce
me
jane
performed
her
duties
in
a
somewhat
perfunctory
manner
she
was
puzzled
by
eileen
and
marjorie
could
not
understand
them
and
was
scarcely
prepared
to
like
them
but
leslie
had
already
stolen
into
her
heart
chapter
xiv
a
cocoa
are
the
graces
forgotten
by
the
modern
woman
was
the
subject
of
the
debate
that
evening
the
opener
s
speech
was
made
by
miss
frere
who
boldly
threw
down
the
gauntlet
reminded
the
girls
assembled
before
her
of
some
of
the
perils
which
lay
across
their
paths
and
assured
them
that
the
old
graces
of
politeness
of
gentleness
of
loving
service
of
all
that
made
woman
noble
and
graceful
ought
to
be
part
of
the
new
life
which
was
opening
its
doors
wider
and
wider
each
day
for
the
happy
modern
girl
if
in
grasping
the
new
we
let
go
of
the
old
we
make
a
vast
mistake
she
continued
her
eyes
flashing
with
suppressed
fire
we
leave
out
what
has
made
woman
noble
and
great
in
the
past
we
shut
away
deliberately
a
vast
influence
which
would
otherwise
help
to
pervade
the
world
for
a
woman
can
be
graceful
pleasant
to
look
at
agreeable
and
not
silly
she
may
be
sympathetic
without
being
sentimental
she
may
be
in
the
best
sense
womanly
without
sinking
into
a
miss
frere
s
words
were
full
of
feeling
and
leslie
listened
to
her
with
an
admiration
in
such
tones
with
almost
similar
words
had
her
own
mother
often
spoken
to
her
from
that
moment
she
believed
in
miss
frere
and
determined
to
do
her
utmost
to
secure
the
friendship
of
one
who
looked
so
noble
and
spoke
so
well
marjorie
and
eileen
however
fidgeted
rumpled
up
their
short
locks
and
glanced
impatiently
one
at
the
other
the
opener
s
speech
lasted
about
twenty
minutes
then
came
the
speech
from
the
opposition
marjorie
could
not
help
starting
as
she
heard
belle
acheson
s
voice
her
words
were
forcible
and
full
of
power
put
together
with
much
grammatical
fluency
and
absolutely
to
the
point
she
did
her
utmost
to
crush
miss
frere
declaring
that
if
woman
the
modern
woman
who
had
such
a
vast
work
before
her
was
to
spend
her
life
devoting
herself
to
the
pleasures
of
the
toilet
to
society
to
mere
ornamentation
to
the
thought
of
what
others
would
think
of
her
she
would
be
frittering
away
her
birthright
and
would
be
a
despicable
creature
there
are
no
two
sides
cried
belle
woman
has
got
to
choose
if
she
means
to
take
up
her
whole
mission
she
must
drop
that
which
has
hindered
her
in
the
past
she
must
cast
away
her
crutch
and
stand
hear
hear
burst
from
some
of
the
students
whose
ideas
coincided
with
belle
s
for
shame
muttered
others
yes
continued
belle
raising
her
eyes
and
glancing
down
the
hall
to
right
and
left
of
her
i
repeat
once
again
that
there
are
no
two
sides
i
disagree
with
miss
frere
in
toto
away
with
shams
away
with
shams
as
belle
said
the
last
words
she
brought
down
her
hand
upon
the
table
with
a
great
clap
which
caused
the
glass
and
bottle
of
water
standing
upon
it
to
rattle
ominously
there
was
a
stamping
of
feet
when
she
sat
down
marjorie
and
eileen
looked
no
longer
displeased
their
eyes
were
bright
and
their
cheeks
flushed
dear
old
belle
whispered
one
of
the
girls
to
the
other
it
is
quite
refreshing
to
hear
her
and
to
see
her
how
true
to
her
colours
she
is
said
eileen
i
respect
her
more
than
words
can
after
the
speeches
from
the
opener
and
the
opposition
the
debate
proceeded
with
enthusiasm
girls
argued
for
miss
frere
and
against
miss
frere
but
finally
when
the
was
over
miss
frere
was
able
to
declare
that
she
had
a
small
victory
on
her
side
she
then
thanked
the
girls
for
their
polite
attention
hoped
that
those
who
differed
from
her
would
by
and
by
see
matters
in
another
light
and
broke
up
the
debate
it
was
now
past
ten
o
clock
and
jane
turning
to
leslie
reminded
her
that
she
had
promised
to
join
the
cocoa
party
in
her
room
and
i
shall
be
delighted
if
your
friends
will
come
too
she
said
oh
i
see
they
have
joined
belle
acheson
i
can
not
help
being
sorry
for
is
that
girl
belle
acheson
cried
leslie
in
some
astonishment
i
only
met
the
chetwynds
and
they
were
speaking
of
belle
is
a
perfect
horror
said
jane
she
leads
the
extreme
party
in
the
college
but
i
do
not
think
anyone
really
likes
her
now
do
come
to
my
four
other
girls
were
already
assembled
in
miss
heriot
s
room
they
had
provided
themselves
with
seats
and
were
lounging
about
in
a
very
manner
jane
proceeded
to
make
cocoa
chatting
as
she
did
so
all
the
talk
was
intelligent
and
bright
the
girls
drew
leslie
into
their
midst
holding
out
affectionate
hands
of
comradeship
they
asked
her
eagerly
about
her
former
life
and
what
she
had
done
in
the
way
of
study
when
they
heard
that
she
had
passed
her
london
matriculation
they
congratulated
her
and
said
that
she
would
be
sure
to
do
well
at
wode
s
and
you
will
be
popular
too
said
florrie
smart
i
can
see
that
at
a
glance
oh
i
don
t
mean
to
flatter
but
you
are
not
the
sort
who
will
go
over
to
the
belle
acheson
i
don
t
think
i
shall
replied
leslie
gently
i
did
not
approve
of
what
she
said
my
mother
agrees
entirely
with
miss
and
therefore
you
agree
with
miss
frere
is
not
that
so
said
alice
smart
i
love
my
mother
more
than
words
can
say
replied
leslie
the
tears
started
to
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
florrie
smart
held
out
her
hand
and
gave
leslie
an
affectionate
pressure
on
her
arm
i
quite
understand
she
said
alice
and
i
also
have
a
a
but
i
do
wish
you
had
a
room
to
yourself
you
poor
old
thing
said
alice
smart
miss
colchester
is
a
creature
but
to
live
with
it
would
be
a
real
trial
and
i
wonder
what
miss
gilroy
will
do
when
the
other
girls
call
on
her
said
jane
annie
will
be
so
cross
she
won
t
make
herself
the
least
bit
agreeable
she
is
that
is
the
only
word
i
can
say
for
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
however
matters
turn
out
said
leslie
i
am
only
sorry
that
miss
colchester
is
not
a
little
more
tidy
but
i
dare
say
i
shall
get
on
with
her
very
and
you
know
you
can
make
your
own
part
of
the
room
as
pretty
as
you
please
said
florrie
speaking
again
you
ought
to
go
to
hunt
s
in
the
broad
he
is
the
decorator
of
all
our
rooms
some
of
us
spend
a
good
deal
over
our
rooms
others
again
are
more
economical
but
hunt
will
do
the
thing
in
any
way
you
wish
and
he
won
t
send
in
the
account
until
the
end
of
term
that
latter
fact
is
of
importance
to
some
of
us
i
can
tell
as
florrie
said
the
last
words
she
rose
i
am
too
sleepy
to
stay
up
another
moment
she
said
fascinating
as
your
always
are
janie
but
i
was
out
so
long
this
afternoon
that
i
am
with
and
i
too
am
very
sleepy
said
alice
rising
janie
that
cocoa
was
excellent
sleep
the
girls
nodded
to
leslie
then
to
jane
heriot
and
the
next
moment
leslie
was
also
bidding
miss
heriot
she
ran
down
the
corridor
to
her
own
room
as
she
approached
the
door
a
furious
sound
of
someone
pacing
up
and
down
fell
on
her
ears
she
felt
glad
that
she
had
secured
the
key
she
opened
the
door
quickly
and
then
saw
annie
with
her
red
hair
flying
wildly
about
her
face
and
shoulders
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
annie
was
talking
aloud
with
great
force
what
can
be
the
matter
said
leslie
as
she
entered
oh
is
that
you
my
new
roomfellow
pray
don
t
disturb
me
i
have
just
reached
the
bottom
of
a
problem
but
my
brain
nearly
went
in
the
effort
i
see
it
at
last
it
is
magnificent
i
do
wish
you
were
mathematical
you
could
rejoice
with
leslie
glanced
at
her
with
a
smile
i
don
t
know
anything
whatever
about
mathematics
she
said
but
at
least
i
won
t
disturb
she
moved
softly
to
her
own
end
sat
down
on
a
corner
of
her
and
taking
up
her
bible
read
a
verse
or
two
before
she
went
to
bed
the
familiar
words
quieted
her
overexcited
heart
she
thought
of
her
mother
at
home
of
llewellyn
and
of
the
younger
children
and
for
the
first
time
a
rush
of
real
loneliness
visited
her
but
i
won
t
give
way
to
it
she
said
to
herself
strange
as
it
all
is
at
the
present
moment
i
am
certain
i
shall
find
it
delightful
by
and
by
i
intend
to
make
the
very
best
of
everything
poor
annie
she
a
chance
to
sleep
with
that
terrible
mental
excitement
i
only
trust
i
shan
t
go
mad
over
literature
in
the
way
she
does
over
annie
having
worn
off
some
of
her
surplus
excitement
had
again
sunk
down
by
her
desk
her
face
was
buried
in
her
hands
and
she
was
sighing
in
a
feeble
sort
of
fashion
leslie
went
up
and
touched
her
on
her
shoulder
you
ought
to
go
to
bed
she
said
you
are
absolutely
weary
from
all
that
to
bed
said
annie
just
feel
my
she
caught
hold
of
leslie
s
slim
hand
and
held
it
to
her
forehead
it
does
burn
awfully
said
leslie
you
really
ought
not
to
work
too
but
i
must
you
can
never
guess
what
depends
on
my
work
there
i
ought
not
to
confide
in
a
new
girl
and
on
the
first
tell
me
anything
that
will
comfort
you
said
leslie
in
a
voice
full
of
sympathy
i
quite
understand
home
life
if
it
is
that
you
allude
i
don
t
i
never
knew
home
life
and
i
can
not
possibly
tell
you
nor
perhaps
ever
but
i
am
willing
to
say
this
much
there
is
a
great
a
terrible
reason
why
i
must
succeed
if
i
take
honors
in
mathematics
all
will
be
well
if
don
t
ask
me
any
more
miss
well
at
least
let
me
help
you
to
go
to
bed
said
leslie
to
bed
with
this
head
of
mine
it
is
almost
on
fire
and
my
feet
are
like
ice
i
could
not
possibly
sleep
i
often
lie
awake
until
morning
when
matters
are
very
bad
i
rise
and
pace
the
floor
you
won
t
mind
will
you
if
you
hear
me
pacing
between
two
and
four
because
i
do
so
most
nights
i
am
sorry
said
leslie
trying
to
smother
her
own
feelings
of
annoyance
i
mean
i
am
sorry
on
your
account
but
you
must
go
to
bed
now
i
can
not
share
your
room
and
not
feel
a
certain
amount
of
responsibility
with
regard
to
you
i
will
rub
your
feet
and
make
them
warm
if
you
will
let
me
and
if
i
put
a
handkerchief
wrung
out
of
water
to
your
head
the
heat
will
soon
leave
it
llewellyn
was
like
that
once
or
twice
and
i
always
got
him
to
sleep
in
that
fashion
he
fell
asleep
while
i
was
rubbing
oh
it
is
so
soothing
do
let
me
try
you
are
a
creature
but
who
in
the
world
is
llewellyn
my
brother
and
the
darling
of
my
your
brother
the
darling
of
your
heart
echoed
annie
a
queer
expression
filled
her
eyes
they
flashed
with
sudden
fire
she
started
to
her
feet
i
am
glad
you
are
my
roomfellow
she
said
impulsively
i
feel
that
by
and
by
we
shall
be
friends
do
give
me
your
hand
put
it
on
my
forehead
it
is
true
that
you
have
a
soothing
the
thing
to
remember
just
now
said
leslie
speaking
as
brightly
as
she
could
is
that
it
is
almost
twelve
o
clock
it
is
very
wrong
indeed
of
you
to
be
up
so
late
and
when
did
you
eat
anything
last
i
happened
to
notice
that
you
scarcely
touched
your
when
did
i
eat
i
can
never
eat
when
my
brain
is
on
have
you
nothing
in
the
room
or
anything
of
that
sort
i
have
a
dim
sort
of
idea
that
a
tin
of
very
stale
biscuits
stands
behind
that
rubbish
on
the
top
of
the
chest
of
stale
as
they
are
they
will
be
better
than
nothing
you
must
eat
one
i
shall
get
something
better
for
you
i
am
sure
that
i
have
been
sent
to
this
room
to
help
you
a
little
now
do
take
off
your
things
and
get
into
bed
try
to
remember
that
if
you
become
seriously
ill
you
won
t
be
able
to
help
the
person
you
mean
to
help
you
won
t
get
your
honors
after
are
you
certain
how
seriously
you
speak
yes
i
am
quite
certain
a
sick
brain
never
gets
anything
really
worth
having
my
mother
has
told
me
your
mother
but
she
must
be
a
i
do
not
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
and
at
any
rate
she
is
only
a
little
over
oh
she
is
more
than
she
belongs
to
the
dead
and
gone
woman
who
never
did
anything
worth
speaking
of
in
her
you
are
vastly
mistaken
said
leslie
with
spirit
you
would
not
say
that
if
you
knew
her
my
mother
is
a
journalist
and
makes
a
very
good
income
with
her
work
i
don
t
think
anyone
could
write
a
better
leader
than
she
and
as
to
her
they
are
quite
the
best
the
ever
does
your
mother
write
for
the
yes
and
for
several
other
leading
papers
she
is
on
the
staff
of
the
you
astound
me
she
must
be
a
she
does
know
a
few
things
said
leslie
trying
to
suppress
a
smile
now
please
get
into
bed
for
if
you
are
not
tired
i
well
just
to
please
you
and
as
it
is
your
first
night
you
are
a
nice
creature
i
saw
that
the
moment
you
entered
the
room
and
i
am
truly
sorry
i
am
your
roomfellow
for
i
know
i
shall
worry
you
terribly
i
may
as
well
tell
you
frankly
that
annoy
you
i
shall
for
i
can
not
possibly
help
myself
if
i
get
mathematics
on
the
brain
i
always
go
the
whole
length
and
that
means
pacing
the
floor
and
mumbling
problems
to
myself
sometimes
for
hours
as
to
tidiness
i
have
known
myself
to
fling
a
book
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
in
a
fit
of
excitement
i
only
trust
none
of
my
books
may
hit
you
by
i
echo
that
wish
said
leslie
but
as
i
have
got
a
screen
i
shall
put
it
round
my
bed
now
that
you
have
warned
me
please
get
into
your
own
bed
now
for
i
do
not
mean
to
sleep
until
i
see
you
comfortable
and
i
am
dead
annie
opened
her
eyes
very
slowly
and
fixed
them
on
leslie
s
face
to
oblige
you
i
ll
do
what
you
wish
she
said
she
tumbled
into
bed
did
not
attempt
to
say
her
prayers
flung
her
head
on
the
pillow
and
closed
her
eyes
how
my
temples
do
beat
she
said
with
a
sort
of
a
sob
and
my
legs
are
icy
up
to
my
knees
drink
this
cold
water
to
begin
with
said
leslie
you
are
under
my
care
now
and
must
submit
to
my
she
brought
a
glass
of
water
and
held
it
to
annie
s
lips
oh
thank
you
i
was
so
terribly
thirsty
annie
drained
the
glass
off
and
returned
it
to
her
companion
you
are
good
she
repeated
she
flung
her
head
down
again
on
her
pillow
leslie
got
out
one
of
her
own
handkerchiefs
wrung
it
out
of
cold
water
and
laid
it
upon
annie
s
brow
then
kneeling
down
she
softly
unfastened
the
bedclothes
and
began
to
rub
the
girl
s
feet
she
did
this
softly
and
rhythmically
as
she
had
done
often
and
often
for
llewellyn
when
he
was
in
his
fits
of
literary
despair
by
slow
degrees
her
efforts
took
effect
annie
s
groans
grew
less
her
eyes
closed
and
in
half
an
hour
she
was
asleep
poor
thing
thought
leslie
i
shall
see
to
her
having
a
nice
meal
evening
i
shall
make
her
give
me
some
of
her
money
to
get
the
needful
things
with
we
will
have
our
own
and
a
saucepan
and
i
will
buy
milk
and
cocoa
when
she
has
taken
something
hot
which
will
be
much
better
than
cold
water
and
goes
to
bed
really
warm
she
will
sleep
i
only
trust
she
won
t
wake
between
two
and
four
o
clock
for
i
am
dead
remembering
annie
s
warning
leslie
put
the
screen
round
her
bed
next
tumbled
in
thought
that
the
bed
with
the
broken
spring
was
anything
but
comfortable
but
then
reflected
that
she
was
too
tired
to
care
she
was
at
wode
s
the
dream
of
her
life
was
fulfilled
and
even
annie
colchester
could
not
keep
her
awake
chapter
xv
belle
s
room
at
wode
s
eileen
and
marjory
had
found
their
way
to
belle
s
hall
they
were
standing
in
the
attic
which
she
had
described
to
them
so
graphically
i
can
not
imagine
how
you
managed
to
furnish
it
in
this
extraordinary
way
began
eileen
i
have
heard
from
one
or
two
of
the
girls
here
that
the
furniture
is
put
in
by
the
heads
of
the
college
now
our
rooms
for
instance
are
quite
decently
too
much
furniture
interrupted
belle
she
uttered
a
groan
as
she
spoke
the
rooms
certainly
possess
the
necessary
comforts
of
civilized
life
pursued
eileen
and
for
my
part
i
can
not
say
that
i
am
sorry
we
have
no
luxuries
but
the
furniture
in
the
room
is
good
and
neat
we
have
a
chest
of
drawers
each
and
proper
of
course
and
snug
little
and
carpets
and
curtains
to
the
windows
need
you
quote
any
further
from
that
tiresome
list
said
belle
again
she
was
standing
by
her
small
attic
window
with
her
back
to
the
view
one
thing
is
delightful
in
this
room
said
eileen
running
up
to
the
window
as
she
spoke
you
have
a
splendid
better
than
ours
do
step
aside
belle
and
let
me
look
if
you
wish
to
said
belle
drearily
wish
to
i
always
love
scenery
surely
belle
you
can
not
think
it
wrong
to
look
out
at
this
lovely
view
no
not
wrong
exactly
said
belle
not
wrong
but
i
have
little
heart
to
admire
anything
i
am
disappointed
and
i
must
own
now
what
have
we
done
to
annoy
you
said
marjorie
much
replied
belle
she
looked
fixedly
from
one
sister
to
the
other
i
had
hoped
a
great
deal
before
you
arrived
but
already
the
keenest
sense
of
disillusionment
is
mine
you
are
neither
of
you
beginning
your
college
life
as
i
could
have
hoped
there
are
two
attics
on
the
same
floor
with
this
which
you
might
have
got
had
you
given
me
the
management
of
your
affairs
i
should
have
gone
to
miss
lauderdale
and
represented
the
case
to
her
i
believe
she
would
have
been
very
glad
to
let
them
to
you
the
college
is
overfull
at
present
and
yet
no
girls
wish
to
use
the
attics
these
attics
are
at
present
unfurnished
and
the
college
would
doubtless
when
the
matter
was
properly
represented
allow
you
to
have
them
as
bare
as
you
pleased
they
did
so
in
my
case
i
represented
that
it
would
be
a
saving
i
managed
the
thing
somehow
and
here
i
am
it
is
true
that
i
dread
the
governors
visiting
my
room
and
ordering
some
of
those
useless
articles
which
the
other
girls
weaken
their
characters
by
using
but
you
did
not
put
the
matter
into
my
hands
your
old
friend
and
now
you
are
accommodated
with
some
of
the
nicest
rooms
in
oh
never
mind
don
t
worry
any
more
about
the
furniture
said
eileen
it
seems
to
me
that
one
can
waste
time
in
trying
to
lead
the
existence
of
the
anchorite
as
well
as
in
endeavoring
to
surround
one
s
self
with
one
thing
at
least
we
will
promise
you
are
not
going
in
for
any
pictures
nor
for
thank
heaven
said
belle
with
a
deep
sigh
had
you
done
so
i
must
have
cut
don
t
you
think
that
would
have
been
rather
narrow
of
you
said
marjorie
narrow
or
not
i
should
have
felt
it
my
duty
to
do
it
i
have
my
own
to
the
i
will
cling
to
them
through
thick
and
thin
what
you
said
just
now
was
quite
right
eileen
we
will
drop
the
subject
of
furniture
after
all
what
does
it
matter
whether
one
has
a
chest
of
drawers
or
not
whether
one
has
a
suitable
or
not
are
these
the
things
we
live
at
wode
s
for
what
about
the
intellect
what
about
the
development
of
the
brain
your
brows
are
capable
of
expansion
your
eyes
are
capable
of
acquiring
depth
hear
hear
said
eileen
do
not
interrupt
me
with
that
senseless
remark
i
speak
to
you
from
my
soul
you
come
here
to
study
to
forget
yourselves
in
the
great
riches
of
the
past
you
are
like
two
miners
come
to
dig
out
the
gold
you
have
heard
of
that
awful
place
klondike
where
people
go
mad
over
earthly
gold
yours
is
the
intellectual
the
spiritual
the
gold
which
is
treasured
in
the
great
storehouses
of
the
as
belle
spoke
she
paced
up
and
down
the
room
her
dress
was
very
untidy
and
there
was
a
great
rent
behind
while
she
was
speaking
there
came
a
soft
tap
at
the
door
she
did
not
hear
it
eileen
went
and
opened
it
lettie
stood
without
dear
me
lettie
do
come
in
said
eileen
we
have
not
seen
you
for
quite
a
long
she
kissed
her
cousin
as
she
spoke
how
are
you
getting
on
capitally
said
lettie
i
went
to
your
rooms
in
north
hall
and
heard
that
you
were
here
you
did
not
visit
me
so
i
thought
belle
might
be
engrossing
your
society
how
are
you
belle
well
thank
you
replied
belle
in
an
absent
voice
by
the
way
are
you
yes
i
remember
now
you
girl
who
ought
never
to
have
come
to
wode
you
are
quite
mistaken
replied
letitia
with
spirit
i
am
a
girl
who
will
be
very
much
benefited
by
the
pleasant
life
which
i
see
opening
before
me
by
the
way
eileen
and
marjory
i
am
going
to
the
broad
now
there
are
a
lot
of
things
i
require
for
my
room
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
like
to
come
too
you
will
want
shelves
for
your
books
and
a
few
if
you
go
with
that
young
said
belle
making
a
step
forward
she
approached
eileen
and
almost
glared
into
her
face
eileen
laughed
dear
belle
do
finish
your
sentence
she
said
what
is
to
happen
to
me
if
i
dare
to
go
to
the
broad
with
poor
lettie
you
make
my
soul
sink
in
despair
said
belle
i
scarcely
know
what
i
feel
my
heart
is
wrung
oh
how
you
disappoint
me
whether
you
buy
things
or
not
eileen
do
come
with
me
said
lettie
i
don
t
know
my
way
to
the
broad
at
present
and
would
rather
be
with
you
than
alone
whatever
you
may
do
in
the
future
please
remember
that
i
am
your
first
cousin
almost
your
sister
and
we
have
lived
together
all
our
of
course
dear
lettie
we
will
both
come
said
eileen
belle
we
will
visit
you
another
day
we
are
only
interrupting
your
work
i
was
resting
when
you
arrived
said
belle
she
threw
herself
tragically
back
against
one
of
the
chairs
go
i
don
t
expect
to
see
much
of
any
of
you
it
is
the
fate
of
those
who
would
explore
who
would
delve
in
the
mines
of
the
past
to
bring
up
diamonds
alone
we
are
solitary
in
our
labor
i
had
a
hope
it
is
true
when
i
saw
you
in
london
but
never
mind
go
all
of
you
there
is
the
i
wish
you
d
let
me
mend
your
dress
first
said
lettie
whipping
a
neat
little
housewife
out
of
her
pocket
and
preparing
to
thread
a
needle
mend
my
dress
said
belle
what
do
you
mean
if
you
will
just
stand
with
your
back
to
the
light
you
can
go
on
thinking
and
talking
i
won
t
be
a
minute
sewing
up
that
awful
rent
you
are
not
respectable
as
you
are
now
do
let
yes
do
belle
don
t
be
a
goose
said
marjorie
belle
s
eyes
flashed
lettie
was
already
attacking
her
with
needle
and
thread
the
rent
was
presently
sewn
up
i
tell
you
what
it
is
said
lettie
i
m
not
half
such
a
bad
soul
as
you
make
me
out
now
that
i
happen
to
be
in
the
same
belle
shivered
i
ll
run
up
to
this
desolate
attic
now
and
then
and
look
after
your
you
won
t
for
i
shan
t
admit
you
said
belle
yes
i
will
i
shall
take
opportunities
of
coming
in
when
you
are
absent
you
are
a
friend
of
marjorie
and
eileen
and
for
the
sake
of
their
respectability
you
must
not
go
about
in
absolute
rags
now
come
girls
and
leave
her
in
belle
approached
her
attic
window
she
stood
now
with
her
back
to
the
girls
and
her
face
to
the
view
but
it
is
to
be
doubted
if
she
saw
it
her
dress
a
dirty
serge
trailed
along
the
floor
one
wisp
of
her
thin
hair
had
escaped
from
the
little
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
and
was
lying
on
her
shoulder
poor
belle
said
eileen
with
a
sigh
i
tell
you
what
it
is
girls
said
lettie
as
she
went
downstairs
belle
is
such
an
oddity
that
if
something
is
not
done
to
save
her
she
will
soon
lose
her
senses
i
mean
to
hunt
her
up
i
was
wondering
last
night
what
my
mission
in
this
place
could
be
i
little
thought
that
i
was
to
be
inflicted
with
belle
she
certainly
doesn
t
wish
for
you
lettie
so
you
needn
t
take
her
up
unless
you
like
said
eileen
oh
i
must
do
something
said
lettie
that
fact
has
been
well
borne
in
upon
is
to
be
belle
acheson
or
nothing
no
trial
could
well
be
greater
i
hope
i
shall
benefit
by
it
but
come
now
i
want
to
order
my
must
you
order
them
of
course
i
must
my
room
is
disgracefully
bare
and
as
i
have
plenty
of
money
i
mean
to
make
it
as
pretty
and
cheerful
as
possible
and
as
like
a
have
your
lectures
been
decided
for
you
yet
said
eileen
in
a
stern
voice
yes
i
saw
miss
browning
after
breakfast
i
am
going
to
work
a
little
bit
at
a
little
bit
at
literature
lettie
you
are
perfectly
well
i
m
not
going
to
kill
myself
darling
if
that
s
what
you
mean
of
course
i
shall
work
for
so
many
hours
a
day
but
i
don
t
think
i
shall
take
honors
if
i
get
through
my
pass
i
shall
consider
that
i
am
doing
admirably
now
do
come
girls
hurry
up
you
must
have
tea
with
me
in
my
room
i
expect
i
shall
know
all
the
nicest
girls
in
the
place
they
are
going
to
call
on
me
most
likely
this
evening
oh
i
shall
make
my
room
perfectly
sweet
you
will
all
love
to
come
to
me
and
if
i
can
wheedle
that
poor
old
belle
out
of
her
den
i
shall
feel
that
i
have
achieved
a
triumph
but
tell
me
now
girls
how
you
are
both
getting
on
very
well
indeed
said
eileen
and
you
are
not
going
to
buy
pretty
things
for
your
rooms
at
least
let
me
recommend
you
to
provide
yourselves
with
a
each
because
if
other
girls
invite
you
to
tea
you
must
return
the
compliment
then
they
give
endless
cocoa
parties
here
and
you
will
be
expected
to
take
your
i
don
t
see
that
at
all
replied
eileen
if
we
are
bound
to
entertain
a
great
deal
at
wode
s
we
may
just
as
well
stay
with
mother
in
london
i
mean
to
ask
miss
frere
about
the
poor
surely
we
can
visit
them
if
we
like
i
don
t
know
anything
about
that
said
letitia
to
quote
your
own
words
you
have
come
here
to
study
surely
you
can
visit
the
poor
when
you
college
life
is
over
we
can
at
least
make
clothes
for
them
that
is
a
good
idea
said
marjorie
much
better
than
visiting
them
cried
letitia
you
can
buy
yards
of
holland
and
any
other
stiff
disagreeable
pricky
material
you
like
and
work
away
in
your
leisure
hours
when
the
rest
of
us
are
having
fun
by
the
way
have
you
seen
miss
gilroy
this
morning
two
or
three
times
poor
girl
i
rather
pity
her
she
is
in
a
room
with
a
dreadful
creature
of
the
name
of
annie
how
pretty
miss
gilroy
is
said
lettie
might
we
not
call
and
ask
her
to
come
to
the
broad
with
us
she
is
sure
to
want
things
for
her
just
as
you
please
said
eileen
i
ll
run
up
to
miss
colchester
s
room
and
find
out
if
she
is
lettie
and
marjorie
remained
on
the
sweep
of
gravel
outside
the
hall
eileen
ran
into
the
house
in
a
few
minutes
she
returned
accompanied
by
leslie
this
is
really
kind
of
you
said
leslie
i
was
wondering
how
i
could
get
to
the
broad
for
i
don
t
know
many
girls
yet
but
i
am
told
that
some
of
the
students
will
call
on
me
they
are
to
call
on
us
too
said
eileen
it
is
rather
formidable
is
it
not
but
miss
gilroy
don
t
you
want
to
buy
things
for
your
room
a
few
things
i
must
have
said
leslie
but
i
rather
despair
of
making
a
room
shared
with
miss
colchester
pretty
all
the
same
i
will
do
my
the
girls
visited
hunt
s
shop
in
the
broad
and
gave
their
orders
lettie
s
were
extensive
she
must
have
pictures
love
among
the
ruins
the
happy
warrior
by
watts
st
cecilia
and
a
choir
of
angels
by
van
eyck
and
other
treasures
were
secured
also
were
bought
by
the
young
lady
who
had
a
keen
eye
to
effect
she
bought
big
jars
of
china
a
few
cups
and
saucers
two
or
three
plates
a
fan
or
two
a
couple
of
screens
a
few
tablecloths
and
a
to
cover
the
back
of
her
chest
of
drawers
a
pretty
little
a
brass
kettle
and
a
which
could
fold
up
and
be
put
out
of
the
way
when
not
needed
for
use
were
also
secured
finally
she
treated
herself
to
a
great
bunch
of
flowers
and
some
flowering
plants
her
purchases
took
time
and
in
spite
of
themselves
eileen
and
marjorie
were
interested
after
a
great
deal
of
persuasion
they
were
induced
to
buy
a
table
and
some
very
plain
cups
and
saucers
we
will
not
get
any
more
it
is
downright
sinful
waste
said
marjorie
frowning
as
she
spoke
all
right
said
lettie
i
am
not
going
to
influence
you
you
are
at
present
under
the
awful
eye
of
belle
acheson
by
and
by
you
will
see
for
yourselves
that
it
is
the
height
of
nonsense
not
to
live
in
comfort
when
you
can
now
look
at
miss
gilroy
she
has
more
sense
than
to
make
herself
miserable
when
she
need
i
certainly
do
not
intend
to
make
myself
miserable
said
leslie
there
are
several
useful
purchases
that
i
must
make
i
have
the
misfortune
she
continued
glancing
from
one
girl
to
the
other
to
sleep
in
the
room
with
a
genius
and
must
provide
it
is
such
a
pity
you
can
not
have
a
room
to
yourself
said
eileen
i
trust
the
annoyance
won
t
last
i
hope
not
said
leslie
yes
i
must
have
one
of
those
pretty
art
and
then
i
want
to
go
to
a
grocer
s
where
i
can
buy
cocoa
and
biscuits
and
tinned
after
a
good
deal
of
time
spent
in
making
their
various
purchases
the
girls
returned
to
the
college
well
laden
they
met
several
of
their
companions
who
nodded
to
them
kindly
i
consider
that
we
are
now
settled
in
college
and
that
our
real
life
begins
said
leslie
i
have
arranged
about
my
work
and
mean
to
study
hard
after
dinner
you
won
t
have
much
chance
of
that
said
a
merry
voice
and
jane
heriot
came
up
why
so
asked
leslie
how
do
you
do
said
jane
nodding
to
the
two
chetwynd
girls
she
then
turned
to
leslie
i
will
tell
you
why
you
won
t
have
any
chance
miss
gilroy
a
whole
party
are
coming
to
visit
you
in
your
rooms
this
evening
it
is
the
custom
and
you
must
submit
you
will
see
half
of
us
and
half
of
us
but
after
that
you
will
be
left
in
peace
if
you
like
our
society
you
can
have
it
if
you
don
you
can
keep
as
lonely
as
you
like
but
this
evening
and
you
must
put
up
with
us
it
is
the
fate
of
all
chapter
xvi
freshers
in
less
than
a
week
s
time
the
four
freshers
were
completely
settled
into
the
life
at
wode
s
they
had
their
work
marked
out
for
them
the
lectures
they
were
to
attend
were
definitely
arranged
the
books
they
were
to
read
were
selected
some
from
the
library
some
from
green
s
in
the
broad
they
joined
the
tennis
racquets
and
boating
clubs
eileen
and
marjorie
having
submitted
to
the
necessary
test
were
made
members
of
the
latter
club
immediately
leslie
had
to
take
a
few
swimming
lessons
before
she
could
do
so
annie
colchester
had
begun
to
make
friends
with
leslie
she
submitted
to
her
roomfellow
s
ministrations
at
night
gulping
down
the
cup
of
hot
cocoa
which
leslie
evening
after
evening
presented
to
her
drinking
it
it
is
true
as
one
in
a
dream
her
eyes
looking
far
ahead
of
her
her
heavy
brows
contracted
in
an
anxious
frown
nevertheless
she
got
into
bed
in
reasonable
time
and
leslie
saw
that
her
feet
were
no
longer
cold
nor
her
forehead
burning
leslie
determined
to
try
for
honors
in
english
language
and
literature
her
tastes
all
lay
in
this
direction
her
idea
being
by
and
by
to
follow
her
mother
s
profession
of
journalism
for
which
she
already
showed
considerable
aptitude
as
she
intended
to
aim
at
a
first
or
at
least
second
class
her
range
of
study
was
very
wide
and
german
french
and
italian
literature
had
to
be
more
or
less
understood
in
order
to
give
her
a
thorough
and
complete
grip
of
her
subject
but
leslie
was
a
healthy
girl
she
had
been
well
trained
she
had
plenty
of
and
an
abundance
of
strong
she
had
no
idea
of
allowing
herself
to
break
down
in
order
to
avoid
such
a
catastrophe
she
divided
her
hours
carefully
allowing
a
certain
amount
for
recreation
and
a
certain
amount
also
for
the
guiding
of
her
wayward
companion
to
whom
as
the
days
went
on
she
became
really
attached
as
to
annie
herself
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
permitted
the
advances
of
any
student
this
large
room
at
wode
s
had
been
more
or
less
of
a
worry
to
the
governors
and
it
was
finally
settled
when
annie
s
time
to
leave
the
college
arrived
that
it
should
be
divided
by
a
partition
and
let
in
future
to
two
students
up
to
the
present
no
girl
had
ever
stayed
more
than
one
term
with
annie
remembering
this
annie
one
day
toward
the
middle
of
the
term
raised
her
eyes
from
her
books
and
fixed
them
on
leslie
you
will
be
glad
when
the
term
is
over
won
t
you
she
said
abruptly
what
do
you
mean
replied
leslie
why
you
will
be
parting
from
me
you
know
i
won
t
be
the
constant
worry
and
plague
of
your
life
if
i
take
honors
i
shall
be
leaving
wode
s
in
any
case
you
are
quite
certain
to
wish
for
another
room
and
to
get
it
also
next
term
if
i
do
remain
therefore
i
shall
be
plagued
with
some
terrible
student
of
the
florrie
smart
or
jane
heriot
style
i
nearly
went
mad
over
the
last
one
you
can
scarcely
guess
what
a
relief
you
are
by
way
of
thank
you
very
much
indeed
for
saying
anything
so
nice
replied
leslie
and
perhaps
now
you
will
allow
me
in
my
turn
to
make
a
remark
it
is
this
if
by
any
chance
you
don
t
leave
wode
s
annie
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
be
your
roomfellow
again
next
do
you
mean
it
said
annie
a
flash
of
light
coming
into
her
eyes
and
then
leaving
them
but
she
added
abruptly
you
speak
of
something
which
must
not
take
place
i
must
pass
in
honors
if
i
don
t
i
shall
and
you
are
certain
to
succeed
said
leslie
in
a
tone
of
sympathy
i
wish
i
could
feel
as
sure
of
taking
honors
by
and
by
in
literature
i
find
these
modern
languages
so
very
what
are
you
studying
now
asked
annie
i
have
to
take
german
literature
from
to
the
death
of
goethe
said
leslie
the
course
is
enormous
and
i
am
sometimes
almost
in
but
you
have
only
just
come
you
can
easily
manage
and
in
any
case
even
if
you
i
do
not
mean
to
fail
any
more
than
you
do
replied
leslie
annie
did
not
smile
her
queer
eyes
with
their
distended
pupils
gazed
straight
before
her
it
can
never
mean
the
same
to
you
she
said
at
last
in
a
solemn
voice
and
then
she
looked
down
again
at
her
book
pushed
her
hands
through
her
red
locks
and
resumed
her
contemplation
of
the
problem
which
lay
before
her
a
few
moments
later
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
annie
did
not
hear
it
leslie
opened
the
door
jane
heriot
stood
without
these
letters
have
just
come
for
you
and
annie
colchester
she
said
and
as
i
was
coming
upstairs
i
thought
i
would
leave
them
with
leslie
thanked
her
and
eagerly
grasped
the
little
parcel
there
were
two
letters
for
from
her
mother
and
one
from
llewellyn
her
eyes
shone
with
pleasure
at
the
anticipation
of
the
delightful
time
she
would
have
reveling
in
the
home
news
the
other
letter
was
directed
to
annie
colchester
now
leslie
had
not
failed
to
remark
that
annie
seldom
or
never
got
letters
that
she
had
made
no
real
friends
in
the
college
and
that
as
far
as
she
could
tell
she
seemed
to
have
no
special
friend
anywhere
here
is
a
letter
for
you
annie
cried
leslie
i
am
so
glad
that
you
have
got
one
at
she
took
the
letter
as
she
spoke
over
to
annie
who
started
up
dropped
her
pen
and
stood
with
both
hands
outstretched
it
has
come
she
cried
at
last
i
have
her
face
grew
suddenly
white
as
death
what
is
it
dear
said
leslie
with
sympathy
at
last
i
have
news
repeated
annie
i
have
been
starving
or
rather
i
have
been
thirsting
you
can
not
tell
what
a
thirst
like
mine
means
and
this
this
is
a
cup
of
cold
well
read
it
in
peace
said
leslie
i
won
t
disturb
you
i
am
truly
glad
it
has
leslie
seated
herself
with
her
back
to
her
companion
and
opened
her
own
letters
after
a
time
she
looked
round
annie
was
standing
just
where
she
was
when
she
received
the
letter
both
her
hands
were
clutching
it
tightly
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
written
words
and
her
face
was
white
have
you
had
bad
news
said
leslie
don
t
notice
me
replied
annie
she
crushed
the
letter
up
tight
thrust
it
into
her
pocket
and
said
abruptly
what
is
the
hour
it
is
quite
ten
and
i
don
t
care
i
must
go
into
the
grounds
the
air
is
but
they
are
just
shutting
i
shall
know
a
way
don
t
say
a
word
i
ll
be
back
she
seized
a
small
cloth
cap
which
she
was
fond
of
wearing
and
ran
out
of
the
room
leslie
stood
and
thought
about
her
for
a
moment
or
two
but
then
her
own
correspondence
absorbed
her
and
she
did
not
notice
when
eleven
and
even
twelve
struck
just
after
midnight
she
rose
with
a
sigh
to
prepare
for
bed
she
looked
round
the
room
there
was
no
sign
of
annie
colchester
how
stupid
of
me
to
have
forgotten
about
her
she
thought
with
compunction
she
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
and
to
have
taken
her
cocoa
an
hour
ago
oh
now
i
remember
she
got
a
letter
which
upset
her
very
much
and
went
out
dear
dear
where
can
she
be
leslie
went
to
the
window
and
flung
it
open
she
put
her
head
out
and
tried
to
peer
into
the
darkness
but
the
moon
had
already
set
and
she
could
not
see
more
than
a
couple
of
yards
in
front
of
her
she
ventured
to
call
annie
s
name
softly
there
was
no
reply
she
shut
the
window
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
for
me
to
go
and
look
for
her
she
said
to
herself
she
is
a
very
queer
erratic
creature
and
that
was
bad
news
in
that
letter
poor
girl
she
spoke
of
it
as
cold
water
to
the
thirsty
she
looked
when
i
saw
her
last
as
if
it
had
half
killed
her
what
can
she
be
doing
out
by
herself
yes
i
must
find
her
without
leslie
left
the
room
but
she
had
scarcely
gone
a
dozen
paces
down
the
corridor
before
she
met
annie
returning
annie
s
eyes
were
very
bright
her
cheeks
were
no
longer
pale
and
there
was
a
brilliant
color
in
them
she
did
not
take
the
least
notice
of
leslie
but
going
into
the
room
shut
the
door
leslie
opened
it
and
followed
her
dear
me
annie
she
said
i
was
quite
frightened
about
don
t
begin
said
annie
don
t
begin
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
i
don
t
want
you
to
begin
to
ask
questions
i
am
going
to
get
into
bed
and
to
remain
perfectly
quiet
and
you
are
not
to
ask
me
one
question
about
anything
i
want
to
sleep
i
walked
up
and
down
as
fast
as
ever
i
could
outside
in
order
to
make
myself
sleepy
don
t
talk
to
me
leslie
don
t
say
a
single
word
i
shall
go
off
to
is
all
i
care
but
your
letter
dear
don
t
said
annie
i
am
not
going
to
confide
in
you
so
don
t
think
it
i
only
want
to
get
into
bed
and
to
leslie
did
not
venture
to
say
any
more
she
lit
the
little
put
on
the
milk
to
boil
and
prepared
the
cocoa
as
usual
when
annie
s
cup
was
ready
brimful
and
frothy
and
looking
as
tempting
as
it
could
she
brought
it
to
her
with
a
biscuit
now
drink
this
at
once
she
said
in
a
voice
of
authority
if
you
really
wish
to
annie
stared
vacantly
at
the
cocoa
then
she
uttered
a
laugh
drink
that
she
said
do
you
want
to
kill
me
don
t
talk
any
more
i
am
sleepy
i
shall
she
got
into
bed
as
she
spoke
and
wrapped
the
clothes
tightly
round
her
oh
do
turn
off
the
electric
light
she
said
again
can
t
you
manage
with
a
candle
just
for
once
certainly
said
leslie
she
turned
off
the
light
and
lit
a
candle
which
she
put
behind
her
screen
then
prepared
to
get
into
bed
annie
s
manner
was
very
mysterious
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
had
got
a
shock
but
of
what
nature
leslie
could
not
in
the
least
make
out
there
was
no
help
for
it
however
annie
did
not
mean
to
confide
in
anyone
that
night
and
the
kindest
thing
was
to
leave
her
alone
by
and
by
i
must
get
her
to
tell
me
thought
leslie
but
there
is
no
use
in
worrying
her
tired
out
leslie
herself
dropped
asleep
she
was
awakened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
what
was
the
matter
she
heard
the
sound
of
someone
running
swiftly
there
was
a
sort
of
wind
in
the
room
she
sat
up
in
bed
annie
is
that
you
she
called
out
there
was
no
reply
but
the
sound
of
hurrying
steps
came
quicker
and
and
then
they
were
interrupted
by
a
groan
leslie
lit
her
candle
and
peered
into
the
darkness
she
now
saw
that
annie
was
running
backwards
and
forwards
in
her
part
of
the
room
annie
she
said
again
there
was
no
reply
the
steps
went
a
little
faster
and
the
groans
came
oftener
then
the
following
words
fell
upon
leslie
s
ears
oh
this
will
kill
me
my
heart
will
break
this
will
kill
me
what
is
the
matter
annie
dear
said
leslie
again
she
hastily
put
on
her
and
with
candle
in
hand
advanced
to
where
the
other
girl
was
pacing
annie
s
eyes
were
open
one
glance
showed
leslie
that
she
was
walking
in
her
sleep
chapter
xvii
the
merry
leslie
knew
that
she
must
on
no
account
awaken
her
approaching
her
softly
she
took
her
hand
annie
immediately
stopped
in
her
wild
pacings
she
did
not
withdraw
her
hand
from
leslie
s
leslie
led
her
toward
the
bed
taking
care
not
to
speak
using
a
little
force
she
got
annie
to
sit
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
then
raising
her
feet
gently
she
covered
her
with
the
bedclothes
and
stood
by
her
still
retaining
her
hand
after
a
time
annie
seemed
to
feel
the
comfort
of
that
warm
pressure
she
ceased
to
moan
her
eyes
closed
the
frown
vanished
from
her
brows
and
she
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
leslie
now
knelt
down
and
gazed
into
the
face
of
the
sleeper
what
can
be
the
matter
with
her
she
thought
can
i
find
out
is
there
any
way
in
which
i
can
comfort
her
i
wish
mother
were
here
there
is
no
doubt
she
is
carrying
a
terrible
heavy
burden
and
she
won
t
let
anyone
help
her
what
did
that
letter
mean
the
sleeper
moaned
heavily
this
will
kill
me
she
muttered
i
can
t
stand
god
will
give
you
strength
dear
said
leslie
aloud
she
stooped
and
kissed
annie
on
her
brow
then
she
went
back
to
her
own
bed
during
the
rest
of
the
night
leslie
hardly
slept
but
annie
never
stirred
in
the
morning
annie
got
up
looking
much
as
usual
but
having
not
the
slightest
remembrance
of
the
little
scene
through
which
both
she
and
her
roomfellow
had
lived
during
the
night
the
day
s
work
began
and
continued
annie
was
if
possible
even
more
assiduous
in
her
studies
she
had
only
one
lecture
to
attend
that
morning
and
the
moment
it
was
over
returned
to
her
desk
by
the
open
window
and
worked
away
without
intermission
at
her
mathematics
leslie
had
three
lectures
to
go
to
and
was
thankful
for
this
as
she
did
not
care
to
be
alone
in
the
room
with
annie
she
won
t
let
me
comfort
her
and
it
is
dreadful
to
see
that
dull
look
of
agony
and
suffering
in
her
eyes
thought
leslie
immediately
after
luncheon
that
day
just
as
the
girls
were
preparing
to
leave
the
miss
penrose
the
principal
of
south
hall
who
always
sat
at
a
little
table
with
a
few
favored
pupils
stood
up
and
sounded
a
silver
gong
the
girls
immediately
stopped
turned
and
faced
her
i
wish
to
mention
she
said
that
miss
lauderdale
expects
you
all
to
come
to
east
hall
at
eight
this
evening
the
entire
college
is
to
meet
there
on
a
special
and
important
matter
miss
lauderdale
is
sorry
that
the
notice
is
so
brief
she
begs
however
that
the
students
without
exception
will
attend
to
it
those
therefore
who
contemplated
going
out
must
send
word
to
their
friends
that
they
will
have
to
postpone
their
miss
penrose
then
immediately
left
the
hall
and
the
girls
went
into
the
central
hall
and
stood
about
discussing
the
sudden
summons
leslie
was
eagerly
pounced
upon
by
the
chetwynds
who
asked
her
what
she
thought
miss
lauderdale
could
want
with
them
all
just
then
annie
colchester
darted
past
the
little
group
and
ran
quickly
upstairs
annie
called
out
leslie
to
her
you
will
be
sure
to
be
ready
to
go
with
me
to
east
hall
this
evening
annie
made
no
reply
she
heard
what
miss
penrose
said
remarked
eileen
i
noticed
that
she
was
standing
by
the
door
when
the
principal
sounded
the
all
the
same
she
does
not
always
hear
what
is
said
replied
leslie
she
lives
in
a
wonderful
and
strange
world
of
her
own
i
often
doubt
if
she
notices
what
goes
on
around
well
then
you
had
better
remind
her
by
the
way
do
you
object
to
us
also
coming
with
you
to
east
hall
this
evening
i
shall
be
very
glad
replied
leslie
i
have
not
seen
much
of
miss
lauderdale
yet
and
am
most
anxious
to
hear
her
speak
i
wonder
what
she
can
want
with
us
all
well
there
is
no
good
in
guessing
said
eileen
and
besides
it
only
wastes
time

you
mean
to
do
this
afternoon

special

next

at
her
desk
and

over

endless
problems

leslie
s
face
when
leslie
paused
she
said
abruptly

not

leslie
started
back
looking
hurt
and
dismayed

said
in
a
low
voice

course

me
alone
aren
t
you
going
out
i
know
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
spend
all
your
time
in
study
but
i
am
different
do
go
and
leave
me
i
don
t
wish
to
be
ungrateful
but
i
wish
you
would
let
me
have
the
room
to
myself
for
a
i
shall
go
by
and
by
said
leslie
coldly
she
was
more
hurt
than
she
cared
to
own
she
left
annie
s
window
and
going
to
her
own
side
of
the
room
took
up
a
novel
and
tried
to
bury
herself
in
its
contents
the
other
girls
had
promised
to
sing
out
to
her
from
the
gravel
sweep
below
when
they
were
ready
until
then
she
would
remain
in
her
own
side
of
the
room
notwithstanding
annie
s
objection
to
her
doing
so
annie
went
on
muttering
to
herself
rustling
her
papers
and
turning
the
leaves
of
her
books
once
or
twice
she
dropped
her
pen
once
a
moan
as
bitter
and
laden
with
sorrow
as
those
she
uttered
in
the
night
burst
from
her
lips
leslie
heard
the
moan
and
found
it
impossible
to
forget
her
she
felt
restless
and
unlike
herself
after
a
time
she
got
up
put
her
book
back
in
its
place
and
walked
to
the
door
ah
thank
goodness
you
are
going
said
annie
don
t
you
think
annie
you
are
a
little
unkind
to
me
replied
leslie
oh
what
does
a
little
unkindness
matter
said
annie
do
you
mind
as
you
are
leaving
the
room
shutting
that
window
i
have
been
enduring
the
tortures
of
a
draught
for
the
last
hour
and
have
lately
been
suffering
from
oh
you
poor
thing
said
leslie
penitent
at
once
why
did
you
not
tell
me
so
or
she
added
why
did
you
not
shut
your
own
window
because
i
require
fresh
air
said
annie
with
that
utter
selfishness
which
had
characterized
her
before
leslie
came
and
which
had
been
growing
a
little
better
lately
leslie
went
to
her
window
and
shut
it
sighed
as
she
thought
how
close
her
part
of
the
room
would
be
when
she
returned
later
on
and
then
putting
on
her
hat
and
gloves
she
ran
downstairs
she
was
met
in
the
hall
by
lettie
lettie
was
extremely
popular
in
her
own
hall
of
residence
and
had
made
several
friends
already
in
north
hall
she
now
ran
eagerly
up
to
leslie
the
chetwynds
say
you
are
coming
boating
with
us
yes
replied
leslie
and
belle
acheson
is
to
be
one
of
the
party
continued
lettie
i
think
it
well
to
tell
you
you
must
be
prepared
for
a
very
peculiar
person
but
you
look
worried
miss
gilroy
is
anything
wrong
oh
nothing
answered
leslie
i
am
a
little
anxious
about
annie
that
queer
girl
i
saw
her
in
chapel
on
there
are
many
fine
points
about
her
said
leslie
but
i
don
t
think
she
is
quite
well
and
i
wish
she
would
not
work
so
hard
however
i
won
t
think
of
her
now
i
can
not
do
anything
to
help
her
just
at
present
and
i
mean
to
enjoy
then
had
not
you
better
come
down
to
the
quay
i
told
the
other
girls
i
would
bring
you
the
boat
we
are
to
have
this
afternoon
is
the
merry
alice
did
you
pass
your
swimming
test
well
i
passed
it
last
week
and
was
crowned
with
honors
said
leslie
with
a
merry
smile
all
her
usual
good
spirits
returned
when
she
was
out
in
the
open
air
the
other
girls
came
up
and
belle
was
duly
presented
to
leslie
gilroy
belle
was
in
a
zephyr
dress
made
in
the
simplest
fashion
and
a
leather
belt
encircled
her
waist
on
her
head
was
a
brown
hat
trimmed
with
a
plain
band
of
ribbon
of
the
same
color
she
was
drawing
brown
cotton
gloves
on
her
hands
when
the
introduction
to
leslie
was
made
this
is
our
great
friend
miss
gilroy
said
eileen
in
an
affectionate
tone
belle
adjusted
her
spectacles
and
looked
full
at
leslie
out
of
her
eyes
how
do
you
do
she
said
abruptly
she
then
turned
and
spoke
to
marjorie
come
on
in
front
please
i
have
something
i
specially
wish
to
say
to
you
on
the
subject
of
a
life
of
absolute
devotion
those
great
truths
which
ought
to
agitate
the
souls
of
each
man
and
woman
worthy
of
the
name
have
been
specially
borne
in
upon
me
during
the
last
few
hours
i
have
just
been
reading
a
passage
which
i
should
be
glad
to
repeat
to
marjorie
went
on
a
little
unwillingly
eileen
stayed
behind
lettie
looked
at
leslie
and
her
eyes
filled
with
laughter
there
s
a
slap
in
the
face
she
said
and
to
you
too
miss
gilroy
did
i
not
tell
you
she
was
an
now
lettie
said
eileen
in
an
imploring
voice
don
t
laugh
at
poor
belle
don
t
prejudice
miss
gilroy
against
her
if
everybody
else
was
quite
as
earnest
and
sincere
what
a
different
world
it
would
be
what
an
appalling
world
it
would
be
exclaimed
lettie
it
would
not
be
they
reached
the
boats
eileen
and
marjorie
who
both
rowed
well
took
the
oars
lettie
sat
in
the
stern
and
held
the
rudder
ropes
leslie
and
belle
thus
found
themselves
facing
each
other
lettie
instantly
guided
their
little
craft
into
midstream
yes
began
belle
i
have
submitted
for
one
hour
under
as
she
spoke
she
looked
full
at
leslie
i
don
t
quite
understand
you
said
leslie
in
some
astonishment
i
dare
say
you
don
t
but
my
time
is
all
marked
keep
a
and
adhere
to
it
rigidly
if
you
have
not
yet
commenced
such
a
valuable
help
to
the
spending
of
your
time
let
me
recommend
you
to
do
so
without
delay
now
that
i
look
at
you
more
closely
i
observe
in
your
eyes
a
really
serious
light
believe
me
i
am
never
mistaken
in
my
judgment
of
anyone
long
long
ago
i
saw
that
those
two
dear
girls
behind
us
who
are
using
their
muscular
strength
in
propelling
us
downstream
had
real
intelligence
that
fine
brains
filled
their
craniums
i
regret
to
say
that
miss
lettie
chetwynd
the
young
person
who
is
steering
us
is
of
different
metal
i
do
not
say
that
she
has
not
her
use
in
the
world
but
with
her
and
hers
i
have
nothing
to
do
now
did
you
say
your
name
was
leslie
you
leslie
gilroy
what
a
very
booky
name
have
a
meditative
face
there
is
thought
expressed
in
the
firm
curves
of
your
lips
you
may
go
far
you
may
fail
but
on
the
other
hand
to
you
may
be
given
a
great
success
think
what
an
awful
responsibility
is
placed
in
your
hands
you
may
use
life
in
its
fullness
or
you
may
fritter
your
gifts
and
be
a
drone
may
i
ask
you
which
life
you
mean
to
full
or
the
empty
i
shall
certainly
aim
for
the
full
life
replied
leslie
in
some
astonishment
whether
i
succeed
or
not
remains
to
be
your
success
depends
on
single
eye
remember
the
untarnished
belle
s
words
were
interrupted
by
a
burst
of
laughter
from
lettie
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
but
really
belle
acheson
you
are
too
absurd
for
belle
closed
her
eyes
and
slightly
turned
her
back
upon
lettie
she
made
no
other
reply
of
any
sort
i
know
you
mean
kindly
miss
acheson
said
leslie
who
could
never
bear
to
distress
anyone
but
how
can
you
know
as
you
have
never
seen
me
before
whether
mine
is
an
earnest
character
or
not
ah
you
little
guess
my
capacity
said
belle
in
a
patronizing
voice
it
is
my
habit
to
pass
each
girl
when
i
see
her
first
in
mental
review
most
i
must
tell
you
frankly
require
the
merest
glance
to
tell
me
what
failures
they
are
certain
to
be
by
a
flash
of
my
eyes
i
can
discern
how
petty
and
small
are
the
qualities
of
their
souls
but
you
miss
gilroy
have
a
soul
up
to
the
present
you
have
never
let
it
die
think
how
awful
it
is
to
carry
within
your
breast
a
dead
soul
yes
it
would
be
very
bad
said
leslie
bad
awful
is
the
word
to
use
strong
language
is
required
for
such
a
terrible
possession
but
it
is
a
fact
that
many
people
do
i
may
almost
say
that
most
do
a
dead
soul
let
us
ponder
the
words
let
the
thought
sink
deep
you
observe
the
fact
of
its
existence
in
the
dull
and
frivolous
expression
which
looks
out
of
so
many
eyes
in
the
poor
aims
which
animate
so
many
people
in
the
ignoble
lives
they
lead
ah
how
great
might
man
be
if
he
could
only
soar
here
belle
raised
her
eyes
to
the
sky
what
a
mercy
she
is
not
steering
thought
leslie
to
herself
we
should
all
be
in
that
bindweed
at
the
other
side
of
the
river
by
belle
dear
said
eileen
pushing
out
her
foot
and
giving
her
friend
a
kick
do
please
come
down
from
the
clouds
we
were
so
anxious
to
introduce
you
to
miss
gilroy
and
i
am
afraid
you
are
frightening
her
don
t
be
quite
outré
during
your
first
do
i
frighten
you
said
belle
am
i
outré
she
almost
glared
into
leslie
s
face
miss
gilroy
whatever
happens
i
can
not
but
be
as
she
spoke
she
started
forward
and
laid
one
of
her
very
thin
large
angular
hands
on
leslie
s
arm
the
hand
clutched
the
slight
round
arm
so
firmly
that
it
was
with
difficulty
poor
leslie
could
suppress
a
scream
yes
continued
belle
i
can
stand
things
as
they
are
no
longer
even
my
own
familiar
friends
turn
from
me
do
you
think
i
want
to
deceive
you
do
you
think
for
one
single
instant
i
want
you
to
suppose
that
i
am
other
than
what
i
girl
nay
a
woman
whose
aim
in
life
is
to
dig
deep
into
the
vast
mines
of
the
mighty
past
those
great
mines
which
have
been
left
to
us
by
the
dead
and
gone
i
want
to
do
you
suppose
in
order
to
help
my
in
order
to
impress
upon
them
the
greatness
of
eternity
and
the
frivolity
of
time
in
order
when
i
really
pass
away
that
i
may
leave
footprints
behind
me
on
the
sands
of
hear
hear
said
marjorie
let
us
quote
from
longfellow
now
it
would
be
most
appropriate
said
lettie
from
the
stern
marjorie
said
belle
i
am
sorry
that
you
have
interrupted
me
with
that
very
silly
remark
as
to
the
young
person
in
the
stern
i
refuse
to
acknowledge
her
existence
but
you
marjorie
are
laughing
at
indeed
i
am
not
said
marjorie
nor
do
i
laugh
at
you
said
leslie
i
am
sure
you
mean
very
well
indeed
and
in
some
ways
i
agree
with
you
i
also
want
to
lead
the
earnest
do
you
is
that
a
fact
tell
me
how
you
furnish
your
room
but
i
can
not
imagine
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
said
leslie
a
vast
deal
for
it
shows
the
real
inclination
of
the
soul
is
the
soul
going
to
steep
itself
in
luxury
or
is
it
going
to
cast
away
all
hindrances
and
run
its
race
in
fullness
in
power
is
it
to
be
clogged
and
hindered
speak
don
t
keep
me
in
suspense
how
have
you
furnished
your
room
my
only
possess
half
a
furnished
for
me
by
the
governors
of
the
college
said
leslie
it
is
true
that
i
have
added
a
few
things
for
i
like
pretty
rooms
i
like
to
look
nice
myself
my
mother
has
always
taught
me
to
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
personal
belle
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
became
instantly
silent
have
you
nothing
more
to
say
belle
cried
marjorie
nothing
replied
belle
her
eyes
were
now
shut
i
am
she
sat
back
in
her
seat
and
did
not
trouble
herself
to
glance
at
leslie
for
some
time
what
a
blessing
for
you
whispered
lettie
bending
forward
from
her
place
in
the
stern
but
i
am
really
sorry
for
her
was
leslie
s
gentle
response
she
is
full
of
earnestness
but
she
goes
too
for
goodness
sake
don
t
let
her
hear
you
her
eyes
are
closed
for
the
present
and
she
is
only
muttering
to
herself
what
a
comfort
if
she
remains
in
that
state
for
the
rest
of
our
row
belle
said
marjorie
what
are
you
doing
now
you
are
saying
something
what
is
it
when
my
nerves
are
ruffled
i
always
find
that
recitation
is
the
greatest
help
to
me
said
belle
i
am
reciting
at
the
present
moment
a
poem
from
one
of
our
great
writers
the
frivolous
fact
that
i
am
out
on
the
water
being
rowed
by
you
and
eileen
that
i
am
wasting
some
of
the
precious
hours
of
a
golden
day
must
be
counteracted
as
far
as
possible
but
stay
would
you
two
girls
here
she
glanced
at
marjorie
and
eileen
purposely
avoiding
both
leslie
and
lettie
would
you
two
like
me
to
recite
aloud
the
poem
in
question
oh
for
goodness
sake
no
cried
lettie
that
would
be
quite
the
last
i
don
t
think
said
belle
glancing
in
lettie
s
direction
that
the
remark
of
the
young
person
who
holds
the
ought
to
be
considered
what
do
you
two
say
of
course
eileen
and
i
would
like
it
very
much
said
marjorie
but
leslie
is
our
guest
and
we
must
consult
she
would
not
appreciate
said
belle
but
perhaps
as
you
say
she
is
your
guest
well
i
submit
my
disappointment
has
been
deep
with
regard
to
miss
whether
you
are
disappointed
in
me
or
not
please
try
to
enlighten
me
by
your
recitation
said
leslie
for
i
should
enjoy
it
of
all
i
don
t
suppose
for
a
single
instant
you
will
care
for
it
but
i
will
do
my
duty
a
word
may
sink
in
a
tone
may
have
an
effect
there
is
never
any
saying
a
suitable
stanza
occurs
to
me
i
am
about
to
quote
from
the
great
work
of
samuel
daniel
who
was
born
at
taunton
in
somersetshire
in
and
died
in
his
history
of
the
civil
wars
between
york
and
lancaster
in
eight
books
was
first
published
in
the
highest
quality
of
his
verse
is
a
quiet
pensive
reflection
now
pray
listen
the
poem
a
stanza
of
which
i
will
recite
is
called
it
is
addressed
to
philocoslus
a
lover
of
the
world
musophilus
is
a
lover
of
the
muse
it
commences
we
had
better
stop
rowing
said
eileen
the
girls
shipped
their
oars
and
bent
forward
belle
with
a
theatrical
gesture
and
a
flinging
up
of
her
right
hand
commenced
either
truth
goodness
virtue
are
not
still
the
which
they
are
and
always
one
but
alter
to
the
project
of
our
will
or
we
our
actions
make
them
wait
upon
putting
them
in
the
livery
of
our
skill
and
cast
them
off
again
when
we
have
here
belle
raised
herself
in
the
boat
for
goodness
sake
sit
still
or
we
ll
be
upset
said
lettie
in
addition
to
poetry
of
the
middle
ages
a
ducking
is
more
than
i
am
prepared
belle
reseated
herself
made
an
impatient
gesture
pushed
back
her
mushroom
hat
and
resumed
and
for
the
few
that
only
lend
their
ear
that
few
is
all
the
world
which
with
a
few
do
ever
live
and
move
and
work
and
stir
this
is
the
heart
doth
feel
and
only
know
the
rest
of
all
that
only
bodies
bear
roll
up
and
down
and
fill
up
but
the
very
fine
indeed
said
lettie
and
i
quite
see
the
allusion
to
myself
i
am
one
of
those
who
but
a
body
bear
roll
up
and
down
and
fill
up
but
the
to
this
remark
belle
did
not
deign
any
reply
she
now
turned
again
to
leslie
notwithstanding
the
disappointment
you
gave
me
with
regard
to
your
room
she
said
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
you
understand
what
musophilus
alludes
to
to
a
certain
extent
yes
replied
leslie
belle
stretched
out
her
hand
i
believe
i
shall
win
you
she
cried
come
to
my
room
i
shall
see
you
alone
don
t
fail
to
be
with
me
between
two
and
leslie
promised
oh
how
could
you
whispered
lettie
i
pity
you
from
my
soul
you
have
done
for
yourself
i
don
t
pity
myself
answered
leslie
i
am
certain
miss
acheson
has
some
fine
ideas
and
that
i
shall
derive
benefit
from
a
conversation
with
chapter
xviii
the
guild
of
elizabeth
immediately
after
dinner
that
evening
leslie
ran
up
to
her
room
to
make
preparations
for
her
visit
to
east
hall
come
annie
she
said
to
miss
colchester
who
was
standing
with
her
face
to
the
window
and
her
back
to
leslie
had
you
not
better
wrap
a
shawl
about
you
it
is
time
to
be
i
m
not
coming
said
annie
not
coming
but
you
must
you
know
it
is
not
only
a
request
it
is
an
order
from
miss
lauderdale
every
student
is
to
be
in
east
hall
at
it
doesn
t
matter
replied
annie
whether
it
is
an
order
or
not
i
m
not
coming
say
nothing
about
me
please
i
shall
stay
at
home
but
why
you
will
only
get
yourself
into
trouble
and
there
is
surely
no
use
in
that
oh
annie
i
know
you
are
dreadfully
unhappy
about
something
and
i
wish
i
could
comfort
you
let
annie
colchester
now
turned
slowly
round
she
looked
fixedly
at
leslie
there
was
a
strained
expression
in
her
eyes
as
if
she
did
not
quite
know
what
she
was
looking
at
leslie
approached
her
and
touched
her
hand
it
burned
as
if
with
fever
you
are
ill
said
leslie
i
ought
not
to
leave
you
you
ought
to
lie
down
and
see
a
doctor
do
let
me
go
and
tell
miss
frere
i
know
your
being
ill
will
make
all
the
leslie
had
scarcely
finished
her
sentence
before
annie
pushed
her
away
how
dare
you
interfere
she
said
her
eyes
flashing
you
are
to
go
and
say
nothing
about
me
because
you
happen
to
be
my
roomfellow
are
you
to
control
my
actions
i
am
longing
for
you
to
leave
the
room
you
don
t
know
what
a
trial
it
is
for
me
to
have
you
here
why
will
you
keep
on
prying
and
fussing
and
interfering
i
want
to
be
i
know
you
don
t
quite
mean
what
you
say
said
leslie
but
of
course
if
you
really
wish
before
you
came
i
had
liberty
interrupted
annie
you
fret
me
beyond
endurance
since
you
came
i
feel
myself
tied
and
bound
yes
you
annoy
me
more
than
words
can
leslie
walked
to
her
own
side
of
the
room
she
had
taken
a
deep
interest
in
annie
and
annie
s
words
cut
her
to
the
heart
i
am
quite
sure
it
is
because
she
is
so
unhappy
she
thought
she
does
not
know
what
she
is
saying
i
ought
not
to
mind
mean
i
ought
not
to
be
really
hurt
but
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
leave
her
for
the
wrapping
a
pretty
blue
shawl
round
her
head
and
shoulders
she
turned
to
annie
she
said
is
there
not
any
message
you
would
like
me
to
take
annie
none
only
go
annie
stamped
with
her
foot
leslie
was
just
closing
the
door
behind
her
when
annie
called
after
her
by
the
way
she
said
there
is
no
key
in
this
lock
do
you
know
where
it
is
i
took
it
out
said
leslie
took
it
out
and
why
may
i
ask
have
the
goodness
to
find
it
and
put
it
but
don
t
lock
me
out
please
annie
you
know
on
occasions
you
are
and
of
this
room
is
mine
when
all
s
said
and
done
i
pay
for
it
and
i
have
a
right
to
the
unexpected
words
of
spirit
caused
annie
to
become
a
little
less
rude
oh
i
won
t
lock
you
out
she
said
but
i
must
have
the
key
please
find
it
before
you
jane
heriot
s
voice
was
heard
in
the
passage
if
you
two
are
ready
she
called
out
we
may
as
well
coming
in
a
moment
jane
answered
leslie
she
found
the
key
which
she
had
put
in
the
top
drawer
of
her
wardrobe
and
gave
it
to
annie
as
she
walked
down
the
corridor
she
heard
it
being
turned
in
the
lock
what
can
this
mean
she
said
to
herself
jane
came
up
what
is
it
leslie
she
said
you
look
as
if
something
was
worrying
something
is
replied
leslie
but
i
don
t
know
that
i
ought
to
tell
tales
out
of
oh
i
won
t
press
you
replied
jane
after
all
perhaps
you
ought
to
know
jane
i
am
unhappy
about
annie
oh
my
dear
said
jane
if
you
begin
to
fret
about
the
oddities
of
the
college
you
will
never
know
a
moment
s
peace
i
am
told
that
that
extraordinary
and
most
unpleasant
girl
belle
acheson
has
begun
to
take
to
you
now
don
t
i
beg
of
you
get
into
her
oh
i
shall
never
do
that
replied
leslie
i
don
t
want
she
added
to
get
into
any
set
but
i
do
wish
to
be
kind
to
belle
for
i
think
she
has
good
points
in
her
you
see
all
the
girls
except
eileen
and
marjorie
laugh
at
her
and
that
seems
to
me
to
make
her
i
don
t
quite
go
the
length
of
laughing
at
her
said
jane
in
a
thoughtful
voice
but
there
you
are
one
of
the
unco
good
i
am
please
don
t
call
me
that
said
leslie
tears
now
visiting
her
pretty
eyes
oh
i
would
not
say
a
word
to
hurt
you
replied
jane
penitent
on
the
spot
you
are
quite
the
sweetest
girl
in
the
college
and
so
we
all
say
now
listen
i
am
going
to
make
a
confession
there
are
times
when
i
am
a
little
jealous
of
you
for
you
know
you
are
so
wonderfully
pretty
and
you
are
so
kind
to
everyone
they
say
too
that
you
are
exceedingly
clever
and
yet
you
have
no
jealousies
and
no
smallnesses
in
you
you
are
a
universal
favorite
i
envy
you
your
i
don
t
know
that
i
am
at
all
what
you
say
but
any
girl
ought
to
be
popular
and
good
who
was
brought
up
by
a
mother
like
mine
said
leslie
with
enthusiasm
some
day
jane
you
must
see
her
if
you
are
in
london
during
the
summer
you
must
come
and
pay
us
a
visit
will
you
i
shall
be
only
too
delighted
cried
jane
but
now
leslie
what
is
the
trouble
that
is
if
you
care
to
confide
in
i
believe
poor
annie
is
dreadfully
poor
dear
perhaps
she
is
but
she
ought
to
be
on
her
way
to
east
hall
by
now
miss
lauderdale
will
be
very
angry
with
anyone
who
does
not
that
s
just
it
jane
that
is
what
frightens
me
she
refuses
to
jane
stood
still
and
faced
leslie
refuses
to
come
she
cried
she
will
get
into
an
awful
i
believe
she
is
ill
and
does
not
quite
know
what
she
is
saying
continued
leslie
she
was
very
queer
when
i
left
her
just
now
that
was
why
i
was
a
little
late
i
felt
her
hand
too
and
it
was
very
hot
i
am
sure
she
is
she
works
too
hard
and
but
there
i
don
t
know
that
i
ought
to
say
any
don
t
say
any
more
cried
jane
i
ll
go
back
and
speak
to
her
it
is
my
duty
to
save
her
from
getting
into
hopeless
i
ll
wait
for
you
here
said
leslie
i
have
had
the
misfortune
to
irritate
her
a
good
deal
during
the
last
day
or
two
and
you
probably
would
have
better
success
than
i
won
t
keep
you
a
moment
answered
jane
she
turned
back
ran
down
the
corridor
and
knocked
at
annie
s
door
let
me
come
in
annie
she
called
out
i
am
jane
heriot
i
want
to
speak
to
you
at
once
let
me
there
was
no
reply
jane
rattled
the
handle
impatiently
it
wanted
but
two
minutes
to
the
already
she
and
leslie
would
be
late
aren
t
you
coming
annie
she
called
out
aren
t
you
coming
to
east
hall
in
response
to
miss
lauderdale
s
orders
you
will
get
into
a
most
awful
scrape
if
you
don
t
do
come
annie
don
t
be
such
a
goose
why
they
may
rusticate
you
do
come
annie
do
still
there
was
no
response
jane
stooped
and
applied
her
eye
to
the
keyhole
but
she
could
see
nothing
within
in
despair
she
came
back
and
joined
leslie
she
seems
to
have
turned
both
deaf
and
dumb
and
i
can
do
nothing
with
her
she
answered
it
is
just
possible
that
she
may
have
gone
down
the
and
be
already
in
the
scarcely
likely
replied
leslie
she
told
me
she
was
determined
not
to
come
to
the
meeting
by
the
way
we
ought
to
meet
marjorie
and
eileen
in
the
center
but
marjorie
and
eileen
had
already
departed
and
leslie
and
jane
found
themselves
among
the
last
students
to
arrive
at
the
great
east
hall
miss
lauderdale
was
standing
with
the
other
tutors
and
principals
of
the
different
halls
on
a
raised
platform
one
by
one
the
many
students
filed
in
and
took
their
places
then
a
was
gone
through
by
one
of
the
tutors
the
only
absentee
was
annie
colchester
no
notice
was
taken
of
this
at
the
time
and
the
proceedings
of
the
evening
were
immediately
begun
miss
lauderdale
stepped
forward
and
began
to
address
the
students
she
said
that
the
object
of
this
gathering
was
to
propose
the
beginning
of
a
new
departure
in
their
lives
and
work
they
were
all
she
was
glad
to
know
acquiring
knowledge
they
were
also
becoming
strong
in
body
the
physical
part
of
your
training
and
also
the
mental
part
are
abundantly
supplied
in
this
great
house
of
learning
she
continued
but
the
spiritual
part
it
seems
to
me
ought
now
to
be
strengthened
i
want
your
whole
threefold
nature
to
get
the
best
possible
training
while
you
are
under
my
care
and
i
think
that
you
girls
of
wode
s
ought
to
take
steps
to
keep
the
souls
which
god
has
given
you
the
undying
souls
strong
and
in
hear
hear
and
once
again
hear
suddenly
said
the
sharp
voice
of
belle
acheson
she
uttered
her
strange
remark
standing
up
marjorie
and
eileen
were
close
to
her
hear
hear
she
repeated
continuing
rapidly
it
was
but
miss
lauderdale
i
was
speaking
of
the
miserable
dead
souls
which
most
of
the
students
of
wode
s
carry
within
their
hush
no
more
speaking
in
hall
said
the
voice
of
the
indignant
chairwoman
miss
lauderdale
after
a
pause
during
which
her
kind
eyes
were
fixed
on
belle
s
excited
face
spoke
i
will
talk
with
you
belle
acheson
presently
she
said
now
please
don
t
interrupt
again
while
i
continue
my
short
propose
that
the
girls
of
wode
is
those
who
choose
to
do
take
up
an
extensive
district
of
the
poor
in
this
large
town
of
wingfield
i
have
spoken
to
our
rector
on
the
subject
and
he
thinks
that
they
could
carry
on
a
thorough
work
of
supervision
and
of
interest
in
the
poor
without
endangering
their
own
health
in
the
very
least
all
those
who
choose
to
become
members
of
our
new
league
which
is
to
be
called
the
guild
of
elizabeth
can
do
so
the
names
of
proposed
members
are
to
be
submitted
to
me
before
this
day
week
i
will
then
more
fully
declare
my
plans
and
show
the
girls
who
wish
to
join
our
league
a
programme
which
i
hope
they
will
approve
miss
lauderdale
said
a
great
deal
more
all
her
words
were
uttered
with
great
eloquence
and
much
feeling
she
explained
to
the
girls
that
god
held
each
of
them
with
their
vast
opportunities
their
great
means
of
culture
their
abundance
of
money
for
most
of
them
were
wealthy
responsible
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
am
i
my
brother
s
keeper
you
ask
she
continued
god
answers
to
each
of
you
you
the
world
says
no
i
am
not
but
god
says
yes
you
all
men
are
your
brothers
for
all
who
sin
all
who
suffer
you
are
to
a
certain
extent
responsible
to
each
of
you
in
your
strength
is
given
by
god
a
weak
brother
to
look
after
one
who
has
not
got
your
opportunities
who
has
not
got
your
wealth
who
has
not
got
your
comforts
and
luxuries
in
life
you
are
responsible
for
him
and
some
day
you
will
be
asked
what
you
have
done
with
your
responsibility
if
you
leave
the
world
without
having
fulfilled
that
terrible
and
yet
grand
obligation
you
will
through
all
eternity
feel
the
loss
of
what
you
might
have
finally
the
principal
sat
down
amid
loud
cheering
most
of
the
girls
were
enthusiastic
over
the
new
scheme
and
marjorie
and
eileen
in
particular
felt
their
hearts
glowing
and
their
eyes
sparkling
after
the
address
the
girls
themselves
were
encouraged
to
speak
and
a
very
animated
discussion
followed
when
it
was
over
were
thrown
back
and
all
the
students
were
invited
into
the
large
saloon
which
miss
lauderdale
reserved
for
very
rare
and
special
occasions
here
they
were
supplied
with
light
refreshments
and
presently
miss
lauderdale
herself
went
to
the
organ
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
played
some
splendid
music
she
was
a
musician
of
rare
power
and
leslie
listened
with
her
heart
in
her
eyes
it
was
past
ten
o
clock
when
she
left
the
hall
just
as
she
was
doing
so
miss
frere
came
up
annie
colchester
is
your
roomfellow
is
she
not
she
said
can
you
give
me
any
idea
why
she
has
been
absent
i
don
t
think
she
is
quite
well
replied
leslie
i
see
by
your
face
miss
gilroy
that
you
are
distressed
about
something
are
you
keeping
anything
back
i
am
afraid
i
am
replied
leslie
distress
now
in
her
tone
unless
miss
colchester
s
illness
is
really
very
serious
and
needs
a
doctor
she
will
be
very
severely
reprimanded
for
this
willful
disobedience
to
the
command
of
her
principal
continued
miss
frere
i
must
see
her
myself
early
in
the
morning
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
nothing
will
satisfy
miss
lauderdale
except
a
very
ample
apology
and
a
full
explanation
of
the
reason
why
she
absented
herself
she
has
committed
a
very
grave
act
of
disobedience
you
know
of
course
that
the
few
rules
that
are
imposed
upon
the
students
are
expected
to
be
kept
most
rigorously
excuses
make
no
difference
the
girl
who
breaks
the
rules
has
to
be
punished
annie
colchester
s
only
chance
is
to
apologize
to
miss
i
will
tell
her
i
will
do
my
very
best
said
leslie
i
am
glad
you
have
spoken
to
me
i
will
go
back
now
and
see
her
without
chapter
xix
the
man
by
the
ruin
leslie
reached
her
own
door
she
eagerly
turned
the
handle
the
door
was
locked
she
called
annie
s
name
there
was
no
answer
of
any
sort
she
then
knelt
down
and
endeavored
to
peer
through
the
keyhole
the
room
was
in
darkness
had
annie
gone
to
bed
and
really
forgotten
her
for
a
moment
leslie
felt
quite
alarmed
her
own
special
friends
had
already
retired
to
their
rooms
she
could
not
well
stay
in
the
corridor
all
night
but
she
was
not
really
thinking
of
herself
nor
her
own
inconvenience
she
was
terribly
anxious
about
annie
suppose
she
had
gone
out
suppose
she
was
not
in
her
room
at
all
again
leslie
rattled
the
handle
of
the
door
there
was
no
reply
at
that
moment
the
door
of
the
room
next
to
the
one
at
which
she
was
knocking

opened
and
susan
merriman
looked
out
oh
is
that
you
miss
gilroy
she
exclaimed

do
anything
for
you
no
thank

replied
leslie
this

locked
and
i
am
afraid

colchester
has
gone
to
bed
and
forgotten
all
about
me
if
so
i
will
ask
jane
heriot
to
take
me
in
until
the
i
am
sure
annie
colchester
has
not
gone
to
bed
replied
susan
i
saw
you
leave
your
room
on
the
way
to
east
hall
this
evening
and
a
moment
afterwards
she
came
out
and
ran
down
the
i
thought
of
course
she
had
gone
across
to
the
hall
was
she
not
there
no
replied
leslie
she
did
not
come
to
the
meeting
did
you
not
observe
when
the
roll
was
gone
through
that
her
name
was
missing
i
did
not
notice
it
answered
susan
but
what
a
scrape
she
will
get
into
how
silly
of
her
well
please
don
t
tell
anyone
that
i
found
the
door
locked
when
i
returned
said
leslie
certainly
not
why
should
i
can
i
do
anything
for
you
would
you
like
to
wait
in
my
room
until
she
comes
back
no
thank
you
i
must
go
and
look
for
her
i
am
a
little
anxious
about
oh
i
wouldn
t
fret
if
i
were
you
said
susan
i
shall
be
up
for
the
next
hour
and
if
you
wish
to
take
refuge
in
my
room
you
are
heartily
leslie
thanked
her
and
ran
down
the
corridor
trusting
that
no
one
would
see
her
she
went
downstairs
the
house
was
already
locked
up
and
the
lower
part
in
darkness
but
she
knew
a
by
which
she
could
get
out
she
went
to
it
found
it
still
on
the
latch
opened
it
and
the
next
moment
found
herself
in
the
quadrangle
she
stood
there
with
the
soft
blowing
upon
her
hot
face
her
heart
was
beating
quickly
she
felt
full
of
the
strangest
apprehension
where
was
she
to
go
what
was
she
to
do
without
doubt
annie
was
in
serious
trouble
if
miss
merriman
s
account
was
true
she
must
have
been
out
for
hours
she
would
be
sure
presently
to
return
to
this
leslie
thought
she
would
wait
there
in
order
to
meet
her
she
paced
up
and
down
her
restlessness
and
the
queer
dread
which
assailed
her
increasing
each
moment
when
the
great
clock
over
east
hall
sounded
the
hour
of
eleven
she
felt
that
she
could
not
stay
inactive
any
longer
if
annie
did
not
soon
return
the
little
would
be
locked
and
it
would
then
be
impossible
to
get
back
to
the
college
for
the
night
should
she
go
and
confide
her
fears
to
miss
frere
when
this
thought
came
to
her
she
put
it
away
at
once
no
whatever
happened
it
would
never
do
to
tell
about
annie
annie
had
got
into
a
scrape
already
in
not
attending
the
meeting
at
east
hall
she
would
get
into
a
worse
scrape
in
all
probability
be
rusticated
if
this
latter
offense
were
known
scarcely
realizing
what
she
was
doing
leslie
now
walked
down
a
which
led
to
the
river
presently
she
stood
on
the
little
quay
just
outside
the
here
she
herself
was
in
complete
shadow
but
the
moon
riding
high
in
the
heavens
made
a
silver
band
of
light
across
the
river
in
the
middle
of
this
light
seated
in
a
boat
was
a
girl
a
man
was
with
her
he
was
bending
forward
and
talking
in
an
eager
voice
presently
the
words
uttered
by
the
girl
reached
leslie
s
ears
is
it
not
possible
for
you
to
do
with
less
than
sixty
pounds
no
not
a
penny
less
came
the
quick
reply
i
shall
be
ruined
if
i
don
t
get
but
won
t
you
consider
me
at
all
i
am
working
hard
terribly
hard
if
i
pass
with
honors
in
my
june
i
shall
get
a
good
situation
what
do
i
care
about
your
passing
your
or
not
annie
don
t
you
know
that
all
that
kind
of
thing
is
humbug
said
the
man
s
voice
i
have
no
intention
of
your
killing
yourself
for
me
i
want
sixty
pounds
if
i
don
t
get
that
sum
i
shall
be
ruined
can
t
you
understand
what
i
mean
yes
yes
and
i
ll
do
my
best
for
you
was
the
reply
you
must
leave
me
now
rupert
as
it
is
i
shall
in
all
probability
be
locked
out
of
the
you
are
always
thinking
of
yourself
and
your
own
miserable
safety
replied
the
man
he
took
up
a
pair
of
light
sculls
and
rowed
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
the
leslie
who
had
heard
each
word
of
this
conversation
shrank
up
against
the
house
she
was
in
complete
shadow
and
trusted
no
one
would
see
her
the
boat
touched
the
boards
of
the
little
quay
and
annie
sprang
lightly
on
shore
you
must
help
me
put
the
boat
back
into
the
house
she
said
the
man
did
so
without
uttering
a
word
the
key
was
then
turned
in
the
lock
and
annie
slipped
it
into
her
pocket
she
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
quay
the
man
standing
near
her
she
said
raising
her
face
to
his
old
girl
you
mean
the
best
but
it
is
all
humbug
about
your
getting
that
scholarship
and
he
broke
off
suddenly
annie
he
continued
i
could
not
do
it
you
may
as
well
know
now
for
certain
that
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
cut
the
old
life
with
that
sixty
pounds
or
without
i
leave
england
in
a
day
or
two
you
will
be
better
off
without
me
than
with
me
but
you
know
what
it
means
if
i
go
without
the
what
said
annie
in
a
low
terrified
voice
that
i
am
followed
and
arrested
think
of
that
think
what
the
disgrace
will
mean
to
you
oh
rupert
rupert
it
would
kill
me
moaned
the
poor
girl
well
then
get
me
the
sixty
pounds
and
you
have
nothing
to
i
will
do
my
best
but
this
terrible
awful
blow
has
nearly
killed
humbug
i
girls
don
t
die
as
quickly
as
all
that
listen
i
must
have
that
sixty
pounds
by
hook
or
by
crook
you
must
get
it
for
me
this
is
tuesday
evening
i
will
be
here
about
ten
o
clock
on
thursday
if
you
don
t
have
the
money
then
well
you
know
what
will
rupert
i
will
do
my
best
my
very
the
man
walked
away
and
annie
standing
for
a
moment
where
he
had
left
her
with
her
hands
hanging
helplessly
to
her
sides
turned
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
college
leslie
waited
behind
until
her
companion
was
well
out
of
sight
then
she
followed
her
the
was
not
yet
latched
and
annie
let
herself
in
in
trembling
and
sick
fear
leslie
followed
dreading
each
moment
to
hear
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
yet
anxious
to
give
annie
time
to
escape
to
her
room
before
she
entered
the
house
in
a
moment
or
two
she
approached
the
little
door
found
that
it
was
still
on
the
latch
entered
and
uttered
a
long
sigh
of
relief
when
she
reached
her
room
the
door
was
unlocked
the
electric
light
was
on
and
annie
was
standing
near
her
window
leslie
came
in
and
softly
shut
the
door
behind
her
annie
turned
and
looked
at
her
what
a
long
time
you
have
been
she
said
leslie
made
no
reply
she
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
her
bed
her
head
ached
she
felt
a
new
sense
of
fear
should
she
tell
annie
that
she
had
listened
to
her
that
she
had
overheard
her
conversation
that
she
knew
a
part
at
least
of
the
terrible
secret
which
was
weighing
her
down
before
she
could
make
up
her
mind
whether
to
speak
or
not
annie
herself
came
forward
drew
a
chair
opposite
to
leslie
and
sat
down
what
did
they
say
about
my
being
absent
at
the
meeting
she
began
miss
lauderdale
was
very
much
displeased
replied
leslie
in
a
monotonous
sort
of
voice
and
so
was
miss
frere
miss
frere
intends
to
speak
to
you
in
the
morning
i
did
what
i
could
for
you
i
said
you
were
ill
humbug
interrupted
annie
i
wasn
t
then
she
laughed
in
a
queer
strained
way
after
all
that
may
be
as
good
an
excuse
as
anything
else
but
i
don
t
mind
your
knowing
that
i
wasn
t
really
ill
i
was
obliged
to
go
out
leslie
i
am
in
a
great
a
terrible
strait
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
you
can
help
in
what
way
asked
leslie
leslie
gilroy
let
me
ask
you
a
question
did
you
ever
want
money
so
badly
so
dreadfully
badly
that
you
would
even
commit
a
crime
to
get
it
never
answered
leslie
then
you
are
one
of
the
rich
and
lucky
ones
i
am
one
of
the
poor
and
unlucky
what
a
wide
wide
gulf
lies
between
us
you
are
quite
mistaken
when
you
say
that
i
am
one
of
the
rich
ones
said
leslie
we
are
none
of
us
rich
on
the
contrary
we
are
poor
my
mother
has
to
work
very
hard
to
support
us
and
i
should
not
be
here
at
this
moment
were
it
not
for
the
great
kindness
of
a
friend
of
my
dear
father
s
a
parker
said
annie
starting
did
you
say
parker
she
roused
herself
and
looked
attentively
at
leslie
i
did
replied
leslie
mr
was
my
father
s
great
friend
do
you
happen
to
know
anyone
of
the
name
my
brother
has
been
in
the
office
of
a
man
of
that
name
and
i
happen
to
know
him
slightly
myself
he
is
a
very
rich
city
merchant
i
wonder
if
it
could
possibly
be
the
very
likely
answered
leslie
our
friend
s
name
is
charles
parker
and
he
lived
for
a
great
many
years
in
the
same
it
must
be
the
same
said
annie
she
clasped
her
hands
and
looked
excited
and
you
know
this
charles
parker
well
she
said
turning
to
leslie
he
is
good
to
you
i
do
not
know
him
well
replied
leslie
but
he
is
very
good
to
than
good
the
fact
is
it
is
he
who
has
sent
me
here
he
is
paying
all
my
fees
he
was
a
great
friend
of
my
dear
father
s
and
mother
could
not
help
accepting
his
generous
offer
you
see
by
that
fact
annie
that
i
am
not
a
rich
girl
and
that
i
know
about
poverty
now
what
is
troubling
you
do
tell
i
can
not
replied
annie
abruptly
i
have
changed
my
mind
it
is
much
better
for
you
not
to
she
moved
away
looking
sulky
and
wretched
don
t
you
want
to
go
to
bed
she
said
presently
yes
i
am
tired
answered
leslie
but
i
don
t
mind
how
long
i
wait
up
if
i
can
really
help
you
can
not
help
me
i
have
quite
changed
my
mind
it
is
better
for
you
to
know
nothing
whatever
about
annie
moved
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
began
to
take
off
her
things
she
tossed
her
hat
on
the
nearest
chair
her
jacket
had
already
tumbled
on
to
the
floor
but
she
had
not
observed
it
she
then
began
to
unfasten
her
dress
and
taking
down
her
untidy
red
hair
twisted
it
up
into
a
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
i
wonder
if
it
is
quite
certain
she
said
presently
if
the
charles
parker
you
know
is
the
one
in
whose
office
my
brother
has
been
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you
that
replied
leslie
i
only
know
that
our
friend
s
name
is
charles
parker
that
he
made
his
fortune
in
sydney
and
that
he
is
now
in
the
annie
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
mingled
relief
and
perplexity
it
must
be
the
same
she
said
leslie
you
are
a
very
good
girl
and
i
am
sorry
i
was
rude
to
you
it
does
not
matter
about
that
in
the
least
replied
leslie
i
wish
you
would
think
more
of
how
you
are
to
get
out
of
your
scrape
miss
lauderdale
was
considerably
annoyed
at
your
not
attending
the
meeting
are
you
prepared
to
apologize
of
course
i
am
oh
by
the
way
what
did
you
say
about
me
the
truth
i
said
you
were
if
they
ask
you
again
you
will
tell
them
again
that
i
was
really
ill
of
course
i
shall
you
were
very
you
were
not
putting
it
on
were
you
annie
of
course
not
answered
annie
now
do
go
to
bed
and
don
t
ask
any
more
questions
i
was
ill
and
i
am
ill
still
but
my
illness
is
not
of
the
body
all
the
same
i
have
got
such
a
headache
that
i
can
scarcely
stand
well
i
am
glad
you
are
not
going
to
do
any
more
work
work
said
annie
the
mere
thought
makes
me
feel
sick
leslie
don
t
let
us
talk
any
more
until
the
annie
lay
down
on
her
bed
taking
the
clothes
and
wrapping
them
tightly
round
her
don
t
speak
to
me
again
she
muttered
and
leslie
kneeling
by
her
little
bed
tried
to
pray
but
all
her
thoughts
were
in
a
whirl
she
hated
herself
for
not
telling
annie
that
she
had
overheard
her
conversation
finally
she
made
up
her
mind
to
do
so
in
the
morning
being
dead
tired
she
soon
dropped
asleep
but
she
was
awakened
just
when
the
dawn
was
breaking
by
a
noise
in
the
room
she
opened
her
eyes
to
her
astonishment
she
saw
that
annie
colchester
was
up
that
she
was
standing
by
her
desk
turning
over
her
leslie
s
papers
just
as
if
she
were
looking
for
something
what
is
it
annie
called
leslie
raising
herself
on
her
elbow
and
staring
in
astonishment
at
her
annie
started
and
flushed
guiltily
i
was
looking
for
a
paper
of
mine
she
said
which
i
thought
might
have
got
amongst
yours
i
can
not
think
where
i
put
it
but
i
see
it
is
not
here
and
i
must
only
do
it
over
again
it
is
too
she
sighed
heavily
as
she
spoke
dragged
herself
across
the
room
and
once
more
got
into
bed
leslie
lay
down
without
making
any
remark
another
time
i
will
lock
my
desk
she
thought
i
hate
to
have
my
papers
and
letters
looked
over
somehow
i
don
t
believe
what
she
said
about
her
own
paper
having
got
mixed
up
with
mine
she
knows
that
if
she
is
untidy
i
am
absolutely
the
soon
afterwards
she
fell
asleep
again
and
when
she
did
awake
saw
to
her
astonishment
that
the
sun
was
pouring
into
the
room
and
that
annie
colchester
was
already
up
and
neatly
dressed
her
hair
was
put
up
tidily
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
eyes
wore
a
bright
and
yet
curious
expression
how
early
you
are
said
leslie
you
don
t
look
well
she
continued
and
yet
in
some
ways
i
have
never
seen
you
look
i
have
a
headache
but
that
does
not
matter
in
the
least
replied
annie
i
am
off
now
to
see
miss
lauderdale
and
to
apologize
for
my
rudeness
in
not
coming
to
the
meeting
last
night
i
shall
tell
her
that
i
had
such
a
terrible
headache
i
could
not
hold
my
head
up
but
be
sure
leslie
you
don
t
mention
that
i
was
out
part
of
the
i
shall
not
volunteer
the
information
answered
leslie
but
if
i
am
asked
of
course
i
must
mention
it
i
don
t
suppose
i
shall
if
you
are
asked
said
annie
frowning
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
you
will
betray
me
i
am
not
likely
to
be
asked
said
annie
i
said
last
night
that
you
were
very
will
you
never
understand
annie
that
i
really
wish
to
help
you
you
can
help
me
by
holding
your
tongue
said
annie
she
went
up
to
leslie
forward
as
if
she
meant
to
kiss
her
then
changed
her
mind
and
a
moment
afterwards
left
the
room
what
can
be
up
said
leslie
to
herself
how
is
she
going
to
get
that
money
poor
girl
i
wish
she
would
confide
in
me
not
that
i
know
any
way
of
really
helping
her
but
wonder
if
no
no
i
could
could
not
ask
leslie
dressed
hastily
put
her
part
of
the
room
in
order
opened
her
window
wide
and
then
ran
down
to
breakfast
there
were
a
couple
of
letters
on
her
plate
these
occupied
her
attention
during
the
meal
and
she
scarcely
spoke
to
anyone
immediately
after
prayers
she
had
to
attend
a
lecture
in
wingfield
as
she
was
returning
to
the
college
she
was
met
by
marjorie
and
eileen
who
stopped
her
to
speak
eagerly
about
miss
lauderdale
s
scheme
of
the
night
before
it
is
exactly
what
we
want
said
eileen
for
the
first
time
we
both
feel
really
in
touch
with
wode
s
you
leslie
will
be
sure
to
take
part
in
this
noble
work
if
i
have
time
i
certainly
will
replied
leslie
but
i
have
come
here
to
study
i
am
working
hard
for
a
very
definite
object
and
nothing
must
stand
in
the
way
of
my
by
the
way
you
are
going
to
see
belle
acheson
this
afternoon
yes
i
promised
to
do
so
replied
leslie
i
am
heartily
glad
you
like
her
said
eileen
she
is
a
dear
old
thing
i
can
not
bear
the
way
lettie
goes
on
about
her
lettie
is
my
own
cousin
but
she
disappoints
me
terribly
in
her
attitude
towards
belle
but
i
can
prophesy
that
you
and
belle
acheson
will
be
firm
i
respect
all
people
who
are
really
earnest
said
leslie
in
a
grave
voice
by
the
way
do
you
know
why
annie
colchester
has
gone
up
to
town
said
eileen
suddenly
annie
colchester
gone
to
london
said
leslie
starting
and
turning
slightly
pale
yes
didn
t
you
know
we
met
her
two
hours
ago
on
her
way
to
the
station
she
will
return
by
the
last
train
this
evening
she
told
us
that
miss
lauderdale
had
given
her
leave
miss
lauderdale
was
very
good
to
her
and
she
has
gone
off
in
the
highest
spirits
she
asked
if
we
had
any
leslie
said
nothing
more
but
she
slowly
entered
north
hall
went
up
to
her
own
room
and
sat
down
by
the
open
window
some
of
the
fear
of
the
night
before
visited
her
what
was
annie
s
motive
in
going
up
to
town
was
she
really
only
looking
for
one
of
her
own
papers
in
leslie
s
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
queer
sense
of
coming
danger
and
calamity
oppressed
her
her
head
ached
and
she
scarcely
knew
her
own
sensations
chapter
xx
not
a
bit
like
it
at
the
appointed
hour
leslie
gilroy
went
across
to
belle
acheson
s
room
that
young
lady
was
in
and
received
her
with
a
fair
amount
of
graciousness
sit
down
pray
she
said
you
will
like
that
chair
which
faces
the
view
i
prefer
the
one
with
my
back
to
it
that
view
upsets
me
when
i
am
very
busy
over
my
studies
but
enough
about
ego
for
the
present
let
me
look
at
you
leslie
seated
herself
on
the
very
stiff
and
uncomfortable
chair
pointed
out
by
her
companion
and
belle
eyed
her
from
head
to
foot
yours
is
a
very
great
temptation
she
said
at
last
slowly
i
pity
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
mine
is
a
very
great
temptation
repeated
leslie
she
colored
and
for
a
moment
felt
slightly
alarmed
was
it
possible
that
belle
knew
about
her
anxiety
with
regard
to
annie
but
her
companion
s
next
remark
dispelled
this
illusion
i
refer
to
your
good
looks
she
said
those
like
you
who
are
condemned
to
the
trial
of
regular
features
bright
eyes
and
masses
of
hair
have
a
struggle
to
fulfil
their
part
worthily
in
life
s
battle
but
there
i
will
add
no
i
totally
and
completely
disagree
with
you
cried
leslie
if
you
and
i
are
to
be
friends
you
must
allow
me
to
speak
out
quite
frankly
miss
acheson
i
heartily
respect
you
i
know
that
you
are
earnest
and
clever
don
t
flatter
a
flatterer
is
indeed
a
false
but
i
am
not
flattering
you
i
do
think
what
i
have
just
said
to
you
most
truly
and
sincerely
but
now
i
must
speak
on
my
own
account
i
have
been
taught
by
a
very
wise
and
good
mother
to
regard
a
pleasant
and
pretty
face
as
a
blessing
as
a
talent
sent
from
god
i
have
to
use
it
aright
in
influencing
for
good
my
fellowmen
beauty
is
a
power
which
can
be
used
for
good
if
one
thinks
of
it
in
that
way
one
need
never
be
and
you
have
the
audacity
to
tell
me
that
you
think
yourself
i
do
answered
leslie
calmly
i
know
i
have
a
very
pretty
face
it
would
be
the
height
of
affectation
for
me
to
say
anything
else
but
do
not
let
us
talk
any
more
about
personal
appearance
surely
you
did
not
want
me
to
visit
you
to
discuss
my
looks
by
no
means
from
eileen
or
marjorie
the
words
you
have
just
uttered
would
disgust
me
so
completely
that
i
should
ask
the
one
who
had
so
spoken
to
leave
the
room
but
you
have
something
queer
about
you
something
earnest
and
out
of
the
common
you
are
not
an
ordinary
girl
and
can
not
be
judged
by
ordinary
standards
i
am
convinced
that
you
will
never
take
life
i
hope
i
never
shall
belle
you
call
me
belle
and
you
only
met
me
for
the
first
time
yesterday
i
hope
you
do
not
think
me
presuming
said
held
out
her
hand
to
belle
as
she
but
i
feel
somehow
that
we
are
going
to
be
belle
s
thin
hand
was
immediately
outstretched
and
for
an
instant
she
clasped
leslie
then
let
it
drop
with
a
sigh
why
had
i
not
a
sister
like
you
she
said
it
is
hard
to
go
through
life
without
sympathy
and
i
get
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
give
you
plenty
in
the
if
i
will
allow
you
but
there
perhaps
this
is
a
temptation
are
we
really
to
be
friends
if
so
you
will
promise
not
to
tempt
in
what
way
how
can
i
you
will
not
insert
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
you
will
not
cause
me
to
allow
luxuries
to
creep
into
my
life
oh
i
have
set
myself
so
strenuously
against
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
live
so
fixedly
by
rule
now
a
carpet
to
the
floor
an
to
lounge
in
curtains
to
the
windows
to
keep
out
the
racking
heat
of
the
midday
these
things
would
be
sins
in
a
person
like
me
you
will
not
insist
too
upon
my
spending
that
precious
dress
oh
i
assure
you
the
simplest
covering
does
you
know
how
short
our
lives
are
and
our
bodies
are
they
not
just
clothes
for
the
soul
why
need
we
pamper
the
body
it
is
the
soul
that
lives
forever
it
alone
requires
careful
why
belle
you
ought
to
have
been
in
a
there
now
you
are
laughing
at
i
am
not
indeed
but
i
do
feel
that
the
soul
is
more
comfortable
and
more
likely
to
thrive
if
it
is
lodged
in
a
nicely
cared
for
body
why
should
it
not
have
a
nice
pretty
house
to
live
in
and
as
to
dress
i
do
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
say
one
thing
that
a
dress
however
simple
ought
to
be
whole
and
and
oh
of
course
i
admit
that
but
is
anything
the
matter
with
mine
have
you
a
clothes
brush
dear
i
should
so
like
to
brush
off
the
mud
from
the
tail
of
your
thank
you
thank
you
but
i
can
not
permit
it
you
are
now
verging
into
the
commonplace
you
resemble
that
terrible
young
person
letitia
chetwynd
she
is
really
i
assure
you
one
of
the
trials
of
my
life
she
is
a
butterfly
impossible
to
be
suppressed
she
visits
me
in
my
room
and
insists
upon
talking
her
frivolous
nonsense
until
my
head
aches
i
repeat
the
words
of
the
great
masters
of
literature
under
my
breath
when
she
is
present
she
sees
me
muttering
and
yet
she
will
not
go
there
she
sits
with
needle
and
thread
repairing
my
garments
and
permit
i
think
she
is
awfully
kind
to
you
said
leslie
you
ought
to
be
i
m
can
t
be
she
and
i
are
abhorrent
each
to
the
other
as
the
poles
are
we
asunder
but
do
not
let
us
waste
these
precious
moments
talking
of
her
i
want
so
much
to
hear
about
ambitions
your
hopes
your
desires
what
for
instance
are
your
aims
with
regard
to
literature
you
will
take
honors
of
course
i
don
t
know
replied
leslie
it
requires
a
great
deal
of
talent
to
take
honors
in
work
like
mine
but
i
will
admit
that
i
am
struggling
very
hard
with
that
object
in
then
let
me
help
you
let
us
talk
over
our
mutual
studies
here
sit
close
to
me
draw
up
your
chair
near
mine
it
is
sometimes
permitted
for
those
whose
souls
are
akin
to
clasp
their
earthly
hands
together
now
then
let
us
speak
ah
when
you
are
almost
intoxicated
with
those
great
and
stimulating
thoughts
does
not
your
soul
burn
does
not
you
brain
seem
to
expand
until
it
almost
bursts
never
said
leslie
if
it
did
i
should
feel
very
much
alarmed
about
belle
uttered
a
sigh
we
are
differently
affected
by
these
things
i
see
she
remarked
i
can
not
explain
to
you
the
intense
the
passionate
pleasure
i
feel
when
i
am
engaged
over
hard
mental
work
there
is
no
stimulant
like
it
you
are
not
laughing
at
me
indeed
i
am
not
said
leslie
i
said
before
that
i
respected
you
as
i
respect
anyone
else
who
is
wholly
in
in
earnest
said
belle
yes
indeed
i
am
that
i
am
ever
thinking
of
kingsley
s
passionate
words
be
earnest
earnest
earnest
mad
if
thou
oh
miss
gilroy
do
think
of
the
frivolity
of
the
greater
number
of
our
sex
even
in
this
house
of
learning
frivolity
creeps
leslie
smiled
and
endeavored
to
draw
her
companion
into
more
reasonable
conversation
do
you
know
what
my
aim
in
life
is
said
belle
at
last
i
will
whisper
it
to
you
but
not
even
to
marjorie
or
eileen
have
i
yet
confided
i
will
respect
your
secret
and
i
am
very
glad
you
are
going
to
tell
me
replied
leslie
for
she
thought
to
herself
that
nothing
would
do
this
queer
girl
more
good
than
to
have
a
confidante
well
continued
belle
my
mother
is
fairly
well
course
not
nearly
so
rich
as
the
chetwynds
but
as
i
am
her
only
child
she
gives
me
plenty
of
money
for
my
own
personal
use
quite
apart
from
the
fees
and
general
expenses
of
the
college
i
receive
pounds
a
term
now
i
have
managed
since
i
came
here
to
spend
something
under
five
pounds
a
term
therefore
i
have
already
a
nice
little
sum
put
by
in
that
humble
little
desk
there
lies
in
notes
and
gold
over
eighty
pounds
i
will
show
you
my
little
she
jumped
up
hastily
unlocked
her
desk
and
taking
out
a
canvas
bag
poured
the
contents
into
her
lap
my
savings
she
cried
what
i
have
secured
in
place
of
flowers
in
place
of
in
place
of
luxurious
furniture
in
place
of
the
and
prettinesses
which
take
the
tone
out
of
life
do
you
know
what
this
money
is
the
for
some
good
purpose
i
am
sure
replied
leslie
an
excellent
purpose
i
mean
by
and
by
to
found
a
nunnery
on
a
new
line
a
college
after
tennyson
s
idea
will
be
realized
by
me
where
those
girls
who
wish
to
devote
themselves
wholly
and
completely
to
study
shall
live
their
lives
i
shall
begin
my
house
of
learning
in
a
humble
cottage
i
shall
take
in
my
girl
residents
on
the
cheapest
terms
the
house
will
be
small
the
furniture
of
the
plainest
the
food
just
what
is
sufficient
to
sustain
life
i
could
keep
a
niche
for
you
if
you
signified
your
wish
at
an
early
thank
you
answered
leslie
rising
as
she
spoke
but
i
could
not
accept
it
my
work
will
be
in
the
midst
of
the
busy
in
any
hermitage
belle
you
have
a
great
deal
in
you
but
you
are
mistaken
on
many
points
you
need
some
lessons
in
oh
don
t
don
t
said
belle
putting
her
fingers
to
her
ears
this
visit
has
been
so
refreshing
and
i
like
you
so
much
but
don
t
spoil
it
by
an
inopportune
and
ineffectual
lecture
go
away
take
your
beautiful
face
out
of
my
sight
don
t
haunt
me
with
it
a
moment
longer
it
is
possible
that
i
may
see
it
instead
of
the
pure
pale
lineament
of
spenser
s
faerie
of
dante
s
of
the
divine
althea
in
richard
lovelace
s
matchless
verses
leslie
went
to
the
door
and
belle
saw
her
off
in
some
wonder
and
feeling
almost
dazed
by
her
recent
conversation
she
returned
to
her
own
room
in
north
hall
just
half
an
hour
before
dinner
annie
walked
in
she
entered
the
room
briskly
greeted
leslie
with
a
hard
and
yet
excited
laugh
and
tossing
off
her
hat
seated
herself
on
the
side
of
her
i
had
a
good
day
in
town
she
exclaimed
what
are
you
staring
at
me
for
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
know
i
was
staring
at
you
answered
leslie
i
am
glad
you
are
back
again
but
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
morning
that
you
were
going
to
town
and
why
should
i
tell
you
i
never
knew
that
i
was
obliged
to
make
confidences
to
you
well
i
don
t
want
to
say
anything
offensive
now
and
i
am
in
good
spirits
very
good
indeed
i
had
to
go
to
town
on
urgent
business
it
was
necessary
to
get
miss
lauderdale
s
leave
she
was
kind
enough
to
forgive
me
for
my
apparent
rudeness
of
last
night
and
also
to
give
me
the
necessary
permission
to
spend
in
i
am
rather
surprised
answered
leslie
but
of
course
as
you
say
it
is
not
my
it
certainly
is
not
and
i
trust
you
won
t
interfere
further
in
the
matter
keep
your
own
counsel
that
is
all
i
ask
of
as
annie
spoke
she
started
up
removing
her
jacket
and
going
to
her
toilet
table
began
to
arrange
her
fuzzy
locks
with
brush
in
hand
she
turned
round
and
looked
at
leslie
i
am
sorry
i
have
been
rude
to
you
of
late
she
said
but
the
fact
is
i
was
so
worried
i
scarcely
knew
what
i
was
doing
i
don
t
pretend
for
a
moment
that
you
have
not
been
good
to
me
very
good
now
it
is
my
turn
to
be
good
to
you
i
shall
make
myself
as
cheerful
and
pleasant
as
i
can
in
the
future
i
shan
t
slave
so
hard
over
books
either
i
have
found
out
for
myself
that
much
study
is
a
weariness
to
the
flesh
but
there
i
am
much
better
this
evening
much
leslie
did
not
make
any
reply
a
moment
or
two
later
the
girls
went
down
to
dinner
together
at
dinner
annie
contrary
to
her
wont
talked
not
only
with
leslie
but
with
the
other
girls
who
sat
near
she
laughed
a
good
deal
described
some
of
her
adventures
in
town
in
a
spirited
manner
and
was
to
all
appearance
in
the
best
of
spirits
leslie
as
she
watched
her
could
not
help
wondering
if
she
had
got
the
money
she
wanted
so
badly
she
hated
to
follow
annie
with
her
eyes
and
yet
the
thought
of
her
and
her
trouble
was
never
really
absent
from
her
mind
leslie
was
engaged
to
attend
a
at
west
hall
that
evening
but
even
there
she
could
not
get
annie
out
of
her
head
when
between
ten
and
eleven
that
night
she
returned
to
her
own
room
annie
had
already
gone
to
bed
and
was
fast
asleep
leslie
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
as
she
watched
her
in
this
peaceful
slumber
the
next
day
immediately
after
lunch
as
annie
and
leslie
were
both
engaged
over
their
respective
tasks
a
servant
came
up
and
knocked
at
the
door
she
brought
in
a
card
on
a
salver
a
gentleman
is
downstairs
miss
gilroy
she
said
he
wants
to
know
if
he
can
see
you
leslie
took
up
the
card
and
read
the
name
mr
charles
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
annie
who
was
buried
not
in
her
studies
but
in
a
novel
did
not
even
look
up
and
leslie
saying
she
would
see
the
gentleman
immediately
left
the
room
she
ran
quickly
downstairs
to
the
common
room
where
her
visitor
was
waiting
for
her
this
is
very
kind
of
you
parker
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
but
i
trust
nothing
is
wrong
at
home
nothing
whatever
young
lady
and
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
replied
that
individual
rubbing
his
hands
and
looking
affectionately
and
yet
with
anxiety
at
leslie
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
to
see
me
said
leslie
and
of
course
i
am
ever
so
pleased
when
did
you
see
mother
last
three
or
four
days
ago
all
the
young
uns
are
doing
well
and
your
mother
looks
if
i
may
use
the
word
blooming
she
is
not
working
quite
so
hard
by
the
way
miss
leslie
i
have
a
great
respect
for
that
fine
young
brother
of
yours
llewellyn
he
has
the
right
stuff
in
him
i
am
only
biding
my
time
to
give
him
a
leg
but
i
don
t
think
llewellyn
means
to
take
a
leg
up
as
you
call
it
from
anyone
he
is
very
independent
aye
aye
but
there
are
ways
and
means
of
helping
an
honest
lad
and
i
am
not
the
one
to
shirk
my
duty
but
now
miss
leslie
i
have
come
down
here
because
i
am
a
little
alarmed
with
regard
to
a
little
alarmed
with
regard
to
me
what
can
you
mean
said
leslie
let
us
go
out
somewhere
said
parker
somehow
it
seems
to
me
that
these
walls
may
have
ears
and
there
are
such
a
lot
of
girls
coming
and
going
so
this
is
what
you
call
a
college
is
it
this
is
one
of
the
houses
of
residence
at
wode
s
college
replied
leslie
the
college
and
themselves
are
in
a
separate
building
but
of
course
we
attend
a
great
many
lectures
at
the
men
s
very
improper
indeed
young
lady
but
if
it
s
the
fashion
why
i
can
t
say
a
word
in
my
time
such
an
opportunity
for
indiscriminate
oh
we
none
of
us
dream
of
flirting
said
leslie
with
a
laugh
and
then
we
are
properly
chaperoned
you
know
i
assure
you
the
thing
is
most
correct
and
well
i
ll
take
your
word
for
it
though
i
don
t
quite
believe
it
all
the
same
when
pretty
girls
are
about
and
young
men
to
the
fore
we
always
know
what
that
sort
of
thing
you
ought
to
come
here
for
a
time
parker
seeing
is
not
i
not
i
young
lady
do
you
think
i
d
mix
myself
up
in
a
mare
s
nest
of
this
sort
no
no
but
i
am
bound
to
believe
the
words
of
a
pretty
girl
like
would
you
really
care
to
go
for
a
walk
parker
yes
miss
leslie
i
have
got
something
to
say
something
not
too
pleasant
either
but
which
of
course
you
must
be
in
a
manner
prepared
here
parker
tried
to
fix
leslie
with
his
eyes
she
gazed
up
at
him
in
astonishment
he
sighed
and
felt
himself
coloring
you
remind
me
of
my
own
girl
he
said
you
don
t
know
what
a
keen
pleasure
it
is
to
me
to
do
anything
for
you
on
that
account
but
there
time
presses
and
i
must
go
back
by
the
clock
well
i
will
just
get
my
hat
i
am
most
anxious
to
know
how
you
can
possibly
have
heard
bad
news
of
she
does
not
look
a
bit
like
it
muttered
the
merchant
to
himself
as
leslie
ran
out
of
the
room
chapter
xxi
what
is
up
parker
and
leslie
went
in
the
direction
of
the
river
they
walked
slowly
down
the
several
of
the
college
girls
were
out
in
their
different
boats
leslie
began
to
remark
about
them
the
merchant
held
up
his
hand
to
stop
her
we
will
discuss
the
beauties
of
nature
and
the
beauty
of
those
fair
companions
of
yours
later
on
he
remarked
but
first
of
all
i
want
to
talk
over
the
very
important
matter
which
has
brought
me
here
miss
leslie
i
want
you
to
confide
in
me
what
is
up
my
is
up
what
is
up
cried
leslie
i
do
not
understand
you
oh
i
know
she
added
her
face
turning
pale
that
you
are
hiding
something
dreadful
from
me
mother
is
ill
or
llewellyn
or
one
of
the
girls
but
i
have
heard
nothing
i
assure
you
oh
please
tell
me
the
truth
at
it
is
for
you
to
tell
me
replied
parker
somewhat
tartly
let
me
assure
you
once
for
all
that
your
family
are
in
the
best
of
health
but
miss
leslie
i
did
think
that
i
will
say
it
i
felt
hurt
at
what
occurred
but
what
can
you
mean
you
felt
hurt
at
what
occurred
yesterday
what
did
occur
i
assure
you
i
am
absolutely
in
the
oh
no
you
are
not
young
lady
you
are
putting
it
on
and
that
does
not
suit
a
man
of
my
caliber
at
all
instead
of
coming
to
me
yourself
or
even
writing
to
of
giving
me
your
full
confidence
and
feeling
sure
that
i
as
your
father
s
old
friend
would
not
be
too
hard
on
had
not
the
courage
to
do
sent
a
stranger
to
i
can
not
understand
said
poor
leslie
her
heart
beat
fast
she
felt
quite
certain
now
that
some
trouble
was
going
to
be
revealed
to
her
she
knew
that
the
moment
had
come
when
she
must
exercise
happen
what
might
she
must
not
give
herself
away
another
a
stranger
had
approached
parker
on
her
behalf
a
queer
sense
of
heartsickness
came
over
her
she
seemed
partly
to
guess
already
what
was
coming
making
a
violent
effort
not
to
show
the
alarm
which
was
paling
her
cheeks
and
almost
causing
her
heart
to
stop
beating
she
said
quickly
please
parker
had
observed
her
agitation
and
he
now
whispered
to
himself
she
has
done
it
i
am
mistaken
in
her
i
thought
she
was
like
my
jenny
she
had
the
same
voice
and
something
the
same
ways
and
very
much
the
same
expression
but
i
am
mistaken
there
never
could
have
been
two
jennies
in
this
wicked
old
world
i
was
mistaken
the
child
was
like
her
in
the
external
features
please
speak
repeated
leslie
i
am
going
to
speak
said
the
merchant
i
am
disappointed
no
i
am
not
going
to
be
angry
i
suppose
girls
all
but
one
and
her
i
won
t
mention
in
this
discussion
are
alike
all
the
world
over
if
they
suddenly
want
a
little
money
and
remember
that
their
father
s
old
friend
can
be
befooled
being
an
old
man
himself
and
they
yielded
to
temptation
you
are
like
the
rest
miss
leslie
just
like
the
rest
your
mother
shall
never
know
nor
that
brave
brother
of
yours
i
won
t
say
another
word
when
i
have
had
my
say
out
today
but
my
dear
let
me
ask
you
just
once
why
did
you
do
it
oh
you
are
driving
me
mad
said
poor
leslie
you
are
talking
about
something
i
did
but
i
don
t
know
yet
what
i
did
do
you
don
t
know
about
that
sixty
pounds
come
now
that
s
putting
it
on
too
fine
you
went
into
debt
for
sixty
pounds
and
were
afraid
and
sent
that
other
girl
annie
colchester
whose
shoes
you
are
not
fit
to
black
for
the
money
i
gave
it
to
her
of
course
for
your
letter
was
so
pitiable
but
i
did
not
tell
her
that
i
was
coming
down
the
next
day
to
inquire
into
this
matter
there
was
a
seat
close
by
it
faced
the
river
leslie
sat
down
on
it
just
as
if
somebody
had
shot
her
she
did
not
speak
for
some
time
had
she
done
so
she
must
have
burst
out
with
the
truth
in
her
immense
effort
for
for
repression
of
her
feelings
she
even
thought
that
she
was
going
to
faint
you
ran
in
debt
child
the
temptations
here
were
too
much
for
you
you
ran
in
debt
for
and
and
all
the
other
sort
of
things
which
please
pretty
girls
you
thought
of
course
the
old
man
would
pay
up
well
the
old
man
has
paid
up
i
am
sorry
you
might
have
asked
me
for
the
money
in
the
first
place
and
not
gone
into
debt
for
it
but
that
is
the
way
with
modern
girls
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
i
see
you
did
not
want
to
pain
parker
patted
her
on
the
arm
leslie
shrank
away
from
him
don
t
she
said
i
can
not
bear
you
to
touch
me
just
you
can
not
bear
me
to
touch
you
well
that
s
nice
hearing
when
i
m
spending
my
money
on
you
and
thinking
such
a
lot
of
you
and
remembering
the
straight
honorable
sort
of
man
your
father
but
do
you
knowing
my
father
as
you
did
feeling
for
him
as
you
still
you
really
believe
this
of
me
said
leslie
believe
it
of
you
how
can
i
help
it
child
but
if
there
is
any
way
out
of
any
way
to
lessen
the
kind
of
shock
i
got
yesterday
i
will
bless
you
leslie
gilroy
to
the
longest
day
i
leslie
again
felt
as
if
she
had
got
a
dash
of
cold
water
she
could
clear
herself
but
at
what
a
cost
tell
me
exactly
what
occurred
before
i
say
anything
more
she
said
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
oh
that
s
all
easy
enough
said
parker
it
was
annie
colchester
who
came
to
me
i
have
known
her
brother
for
a
year
or
two
rupert
is
about
as
bad
a
lot
as
i
have
ever
met
the
girl
is
different
clever
with
a
lot
of
enthusiasm
and
blind
worship
for
that
brother
of
hers
i
helped
rupert
took
him
into
my
own
office
but
afterwards
i
had
to
give
him
the
sack
i
could
not
keep
that
sort
about
me
you
please
go
on
said
leslie
well
i
dismissed
him
a
month
ago
for
improper
conduct
i
expect
that
chap
will
go
to
the
dogs
as
fast
as
he
can
i
am
the
last
man
leslie
to
uphold
young
rascals
of
that
sort
he
is
a
scoundrel
and
the
least
said
about
him
the
better
the
girl
is
different
i
had
letters
from
her
now
and
then
and
she
always
spoke
of
you
with
great
affection
she
never
mentioned
you
by
name
and
i
never
guessed
until
yesterday
when
she
called
to
see
me
that
you
were
the
girl
her
roomfellow
she
said
whom
she
liked
better
than
anybody
else
at
wode
you
were
the
same
girl
whom
i
cared
for
more
than
aught
else
in
the
oh
you
don
t
said
leslie
there
was
a
break
in
her
voice
i
do
child
you
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
jenny
come
back
again
but
there
once
for
all
i
will
not
drag
jenny
into
this
annie
colchester
called
at
my
office
yesterday
she
brought
me
a
note
from
you
by
the
way
here
it
don
t
show
it
to
me
said
leslie
suddenly
don
t
show
you
your
own
letter
why
not
don
t
ask
she
felt
cold
and
sick
if
parker
really
showed
her
that
letter
written
by
annie
but
signed
in
her
name
she
knew
that
she
could
not
trust
herself
she
knew
that
she
must
say
something
which
would
betray
her
miserable
friend
the
one
rope
she
had
to
cling
to
was
a
blind
sense
of
honor
she
would
give
annie
a
chance
she
would
not
betray
her
she
would
get
annie
herself
to
make
her
own
confession
what
train
must
you
go
back
by
she
said
suddenly
you
look
quite
ill
child
i
see
you
can
not
put
the
thing
straight
as
i
had
hoped
just
for
a
moment
but
after
i
have
asked
you
one
or
two
questions
we
will
never
allude
to
the
matter
again
was
it
an
ordinary
debt
you
wanted
the
money
for
leslie
bent
her
head
in
apparent
acquiescence
then
that
is
a
relief
i
did
think
that
you
were
above
all
the
petty
wants
and
caprices
of
your
sex
but
if
you
do
want
to
look
pretty
and
charming
why
my
dear
i
have
more
money
than
i
know
what
to
do
with
here
fumbled
in
his
would
you
like
another
twenty
pounds
for
i
have
got
some
i
could
let
you
have
three
or
four
you
are
pretty
enough
to
look
charming
in
the
simplest
dress
but
if
you
think
otherwise
oh
don
t
parker
cried
leslie
i
can
not
touch
your
money
put
it
away
she
pushed
it
from
her
the
strain
was
becoming
intolerable
did
you
say
she
continued
that
annie
took
you
that
note
herself
yes
my
dear
you
told
me
in
it
that
you
particularly
wished
to
get
the
money
in
notes
and
gold
so
i
sent
notes
and
gold
now
leslie
don
t
be
tempted
in
that
way
again
if
you
want
money
come
to
me
straight
say
to
me
mr
parker
for
the
sake
of
my
father
let
me
have
five
pounds
or
ten
or
fifteen
or
whatever
supply
you
want
don
t
ask
me
in
jenny
s
name
for
jenny
would
not
have
done
that
sort
of
thing
but
for
gilroy
s
sake
ll
never
refuse
you
child
don
t
go
into
debt
for
it
that
s
i
never
will
said
poor
leslie
oh
i
can
not
explain
things
now
and
i
know
you
must
think
dreadfully
of
i
see
you
are
concealing
something
said
parker
knitting
his
brows
and
giving
her
another
fixed
look
tell
me
the
whole
truth
little
i
can
t
not
at
parker
s
voice
changed
again
he
looked
hard
at
leslie
then
he
looked
away
he
pursed
up
his
lips
and
uttered
a
long
whistle
if
you
can
not
tell
me
well
there
s
no
more
to
be
said
he
remarked
i
am
cut
up
a
bit
that
s
all
but
understand
this
leslie
i
ll
have
no
more
fooling
there
is
a
limit
even
to
my
endurance
and
when
roused
i
can
be
hard
and
very
just
i
will
never
tell
your
mother
i
wouldn
t
vex
her
nor
give
her
another
care
for
all
the
money
i
possess
you
did
wrong
in
spending
that
money
before
you
got
it
you
did
very
wrong
to
go
into
debt
if
you
go
in
debt
again
why
there
i
won
t
help
you
but
if
you
ask
me
for
money
and
say
you
want
it
and
give
me
a
good
if
it
is
to
buy
a
smart
frock
or
pretty
shall
have
it
child
and
there
s
my
last
word
my
dear
don
t
fret
too
much
whatever
you
may
have
done
wrong
you
stand
in
jenny
s
place
to
me
now
cheer
up
cheer
but
leslie
could
not
utter
a
word
she
did
not
even
raise
her
head
she
was
only
conscious
that
parker
had
pulled
out
his
watch
uttered
a
hasty
exclamation
looked
to
right
and
left
then
going
up
to
her
stooped
and
kissed
her
lightly
on
her
forehead
for
your
father
s
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
old
times
he
said
she
heard
his
retreating
footsteps
as
he
went
along
the
to
wingfield
for
nearly
an
hour
leslie
gilroy
sat
on
that
seat
alone
none
of
her
companions
came
by
she
was
glad
of
this
if
she
could
be
said
to
be
glad
of
anything
at
that
moment
she
felt
stunned
all
her
life
up
to
the
present
had
been
bright
she
found
herself
all
of
a
sudden
through
no
fault
of
her
own
in
the
position
of
one
who
is
degraded
dishonored
she
who
had
always
been
upright
respectable
and
respected
with
her
and
open
sin
there
was
nothing
whatever
in
common
to
sin
gravely
to
commit
a
really
great
sin
was
impossible
to
a
nature
like
leslie
s
direct
temptation
would
shrink
away
from
one
so
pure
so
innocent
so
generous
so
loving
and
now
she
was
stained
just
as
if
she
had
really
committed
the
sin
which
she
loathed
how
could
she
live
under
this
terrible
imputation
how
could
she
take
the
sin
of
another
and
bear
it
bravely
on
her
young
shoulders
the
man
to
whom
she
was
indebted
for
so
much
believed
her
guilty
how
could
she
stand
it
was
it
right
for
her
to
stand
it
leslie
considered
this
with
bent
head
and
knitted
brows
suppose
she
wrote
to
parker
and
told
him
the
truth
what
would
happen
then
she
could
guess
and
the
thought
of
what
would
happen
caused
her
to
tremble
he
liked
her
he
was
kind
to
her
for
her
dead
father
s
sake
and
because
he
imagined
that
she
bore
a
likeness
to
the
child
he
had
lost
but
he
had
spoken
with
a
certain
harshness
of
the
colchesters
he
would
certainly
not
stand
the
knowledge
that
he
had
been
befooled
by
a
girl
twice
as
clever
as
himself
he
would
come
down
to
wingfield
he
would
see
annie
he
would
speak
to
the
authorities
about
her
she
would
be
rusticated
sent
down
expelled
her
career
in
life
would
be
practically
ruined
no
leslie
felt
she
could
not
betray
her
not
yet
anyhow
she
said
to
herself
if
she
will
confess
i
think
parker
will
forgive
her
but
i
can
not
be
the
one
to
ruin
her
whole
leslie
struggled
hard
to
regain
her
ordinary
calmness
but
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
get
it
back
annie
had
hurt
her
too
deeply
to
take
a
letter
purporting
to
be
written
in
her
hand
to
parker
to
borrow
money
in
her
name
to
get
parker
to
think
so
badly
of
her
oh
the
sin
was
too
dark
it
cut
too
sore
it
lay
too
deep
leslie
shivered
as
she
returned
slowly
to
the
house
eileen
chetwynd
met
her
in
the
quadrangle
and
ran
up
eagerly
we
were
looking
for
you
leslie
she
cried
we
wanted
you
to
come
on
the
water
with
us
this
lovely
afternoon
have
you
a
headache
you
don
t
look
perhaps
i
have
a
headache
but
i
don
t
quite
know
replied
leslie
you
don
t
quite
know
you
look
i
will
go
upstairs
and
lie
leslie
ran
past
eileen
who
stared
after
her
in
some
wonder
when
leslie
entered
her
room
annie
still
buried
in
her
novel
was
crouched
up
on
the
her
books
papers
and
problems
were
pushed
aside
her
hair
was
rumpled
her
cheeks
slightly
flushed
nevertheless
there
was
an
expression
of
rest
about
her
face
that
leslie
had
never
before
seen
there
she
turned
away
from
her
feeling
that
she
could
scarcely
bear
to
inhabit
the
same
room
for
the
first
time
in
her
gentle
life
hatred
of
another
was
visiting
her
her
religious
principles
did
not
come
to
her
aid
in
this
crisis
she
felt
a
sense
of
being
crushed
she
felt
sure
that
because
of
this
thing
she
must
go
halt
and
maimed
for
the
remainder
of
her
days
annie
looked
up
as
she
came
in
had
a
good
time
she
asked
in
a
light
careless
sort
of
voice
i
was
down
by
the
river
replied
leslie
coldly
has
your
visitor
gone
asked
annie
not
noticing
the
tone
yes
he
returned
to
london
by
the
leslie
wondered
that
annie
did
not
take
alarm
when
she
heard
that
her
visitor
had
come
from
london
but
the
possibility
of
parker
s
appearing
at
wingfield
had
evidently
never
entered
her
brain
she
turned
another
page
of
her
novel
and
read
on
contentedly
how
good
it
is
to
have
a
whole
afternoon
s
real
rest
she
said
and
this
book
is
splendid
by
the
way
have
you
read
the
caxtons
by
bulwer
lytton
yes
i
have
read
it
replied
leslie
in
a
low
voice
don
t
you
want
to
make
any
tea
this
afternoon
said
annie
i
am
so
i
don
t
care
about
tea
replied
leslie
we
shall
be
going
down
to
dinner
in
less
than
an
annie
stifled
a
sigh
and
once
more
resumed
her
book
leslie
went
and
sat
with
her
back
to
her
she
took
up
a
book
but
she
could
not
read
as
a
rule
it
was
leslie
s
task
and
privilege
to
get
tea
for
them
both
annie
missed
her
companion
s
gentle
attentions
after
a
minute
or
two
she
tumbled
down
from
her
seat
on
the
and
began
in
a
perfunctory
manner
to
get
ready
for
dinner
leslie
also
rose
shook
out
her
dress
put
on
a
fresh
tie
and
collar
and
smoothed
her
hair
you
are
not
making
much
of
a
toilet
this
evening
said
annie
oh
i
shall
do
very
well
replied
leslie
do
i
should
think
you
will
said
annie
in
a
tone
almost
of
affection
if
i
had
as
pretty
a
face
as
yours
i
should
not
much
mind
how
i
dressed
or
yes
perhaps
i
should
perhaps
i
should
give
up
my
whole
life
to
my
beautiful
face
and
spend
all
my
time
devising
means
to
make
it
still
more
don
t
said
leslie
in
a
sharp
voice
the
thought
that
parker
also
supposed
that
she
was
vain
enough
and
despicable
enough
to
go
into
debt
for
fine
clothes
returned
to
her
memory
with
annie
s
words
you
look
sweet
said
annie
come
along
take
my
arm
i
am
in
a
mighty
good
humor
i
can
tell
you
and
as
hungry
as
a
hawk
i
missed
the
tea
which
you
you
kind
little
roomfellow
have
generally
got
for
go
on
don
t
wait
for
me
said
leslie
i
have
forgotten
a
she
ran
back
just
when
they
reached
the
door
annie
in
some
wonder
went
downstairs
alone
leslie
waited
until
she
had
gone
oh
god
help
me
to
bear
it
she
said
raising
a
piteous
cry
to
the
one
who
alone
could
help
her
then
feeling
a
little
better
she
went
downstairs
and
took
her
place
at
table
when
dinner
was
over
one
or
two
girls
came
up
to
invite
both
annie
and
leslie
to
join
them
at
a
leslie
looked
at
annie
with
a
sort
of
suppressed
eagerness
she
will
be
going
out
presently
thought
the
girl
she
will
be
going
to
meet
that
bad
fellow
to
give
him
the
money
which
has
ruined
my
life
i
shall
watch
her
i
hate
being
with
her
and
yet
i
can
not
keep
away
from
she
waited
for
annie
to
speak
again
do
you
want
to
go
she
said
no
i
can
not
go
this
evening
said
annie
but
it
will
be
all
right
for
you
leslie
you
will
go

you
not
i
shall
stay
with
said
leslie
in
a
dogged
sort
of
voice
the
girls
who
had
invited
them
looked
somewhat
surprised
and
disappointed
they
said
nothing
more
however
and
leslie
and
annie
went
upstairs
once
more
to
their
own
room
annie
went
and
stood
by
the
open
window
what
can
be
the
matter
with
you
she
said
turning
to
her
companion
you
do
look
very
queer
you
have
not
been
a
bit
like
yourself
for
the
last
hour
or
leslie
made
no
reply
annie
glanced
at
her
again
it
is
so
hot
she
said
i

going
out
for
a
stroll
i
may
not
be
in
until
ten
or
even
later
why
leslie
gilroy

now
annie

turn
to

pale
her
eyes
startled
and
alarmed
glanced
from
leslie
to
the
ground
at
any
rate

t
keep
me
now
she
said
a
shiver
passing
through
her
frame
when
i
come
back

will
talk
with
you
as
long
as
you
like
but
i
am
in

something
to

to

to

the
night
before

after
the
meeting
at
east
hall
i
came
back
to
our
room
and
found
you
absent
i
was
restless
and
miserable
about
you
and
i
went
out
to
look
for
you
i
was
standing
near

annie

i

he
spoke
cruelly
to

and
promised
to

him
you
were
in
great
trouble
and
i
pitied
you
from
my
very
soul
i
did
not

i
could
not
guess
that
you
would
make
use
of
me

crudest
the
most
terrible
use
you
forged
a
letter
in
my
name
and
you
took
it
to
my
friend
can
you
know
said
annie
her
voice
had
sunk
to
the
lowest
whisper
leslie
had
to
strain
her
ears
to
catch
the
words
i
know
in
the
best
possible
way
and
from
the
best
authority
replied
leslie
mr
parker
came
to
see
me
and
he
told
me
and
you
betrayed
me
annie
flung
herself
suddenly
on
her
knees
she
covered
her
face
with
her
shaking
hands
oh
and
i
thought
myself
safe
she
continued
i
have
lived
through
such
awful
beyond
words

mine
and
just
when
i
thought
myself
safe
oh
i
was
resting

so
tired
but
all
my
security
was
false
and
i
am
done
why

ever
born
she
uttered
a
piercing
cry
and
fell
forward
on
her
face
and
hands

up

t
kneel
like
that
i
did
not

noblest
girl

to
me

parker
to
go
on
thinking
day
after
day
month

month
and
year
after
year
that
i
was
really
guilty
of
the
terrible
sin
and
meanness
of
going
into
debt
for
sixty
pounds
and
then
sending
you
to
him
to
ask
him
to
pay
my
debt
you
can
not
mean
this
annie
yes
i
do
mean
it
and
so
would
you
if
you
had
a
brother
like
rupert
and
you
felt
that
all
his
future
depended
on
your
helping
him
what
are
you
compared
to
rupert
he
is
the
only
one
in
the
world
i
passionately
love
oh
there
the
clock
has
struck
ten
and
he
will
be
waiting
for
me
if
he
does
not
get
that
sixty
pounds
he
will
be
desperate
the
police
are
after
him
i
know
he
will
be
locked
up
oh
what
is
your
grief
compared
to
his
misery
leslie
i
am
going
out

did
not
betray
me
and
you
won
t
betray
me
now

me

me
not
without
me
said
leslie
with
sudden
firmness
if
you

i
shall
go
but
if
you
refuse
i
will
speak
oh
don
t
don
t
come
if
you
wish
anything
so
that

to
him

servitude

mad

be
quick

quick
annie
dragged
leslie
by
her
arm
not
allowing
her
time
to
utter
another
word
the
girls
flew
downstairs
together
and
a
moment
later
were
out
with
the
stars
looking
down
at
them
and
the
moon
shining
on
the
beautiful
river
chapter
xxii
the
promise
annie
dragged
her
companion
in
the
direction
of
the
a
man
was
standing
in
the
deepest
shadow
when
the
girls
came
up
he
took
a
step
forward
then
seeing
two
he
started
back
it
is
all
right
rupert
cried
annie
have
got
the
leslie
who
was
watching
him
attentively
saw
him
change
color
he
had
a
bronzed
cheek
and
a
keen
dark
eye
the
bronze
left
his
cheek
now
and
his
eyes
flashed
fire
is
it
true
he
said
annie
held
out
both
her
hands
to
him
he
clasped
them
so
tight
that
it
was
with
difficulty
she
could
repress
a
cry
but
as
he
did
so
he
looked
beyond
her
at
leslie
there
was
alarm
and
incredulity
in
his
glance
it
is
all
right
i
brought
her
here
or
rather
she
would
come
it
is
through
her
i
got
it
all
my
life
i
must
thank
her
for
what
she
has
done
for
this
is
more
than
i
can
bear
cried
leslie
i
have
come
here
it
is
true
colchester
but
not
for
the
purpose
you
think
i
have
come
here
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
i
do
not
know
what
trouble
you
have
got
into
nor
do
i
wish
to

but
i
do
know
what
your
sister
has
done

blame
her
most
bitterly
but
i
blame
you
don
t

tell
cried
annie
she
came
up
to
leslie
and
tried
to
put
her
hand
across
her
mouth
i
will
tell
him
but
no
one
else
said
leslie
he
must
know
he
drove
you
to
it
and
he
must
know
listen
she
added
she
came
up
close
to
rupert
colchester
and
stared
him
full
in
the
face
your
sister
wrote
a
letter
in
my
name
to
my
best
friend
she
wrote
it
to
the
man
who
is
kinder
to
me
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
she
signed
the
letter
with
my
signature
and
he
thought
that
it
came
from
me
having
written
the
letter
she
made
an
excuse
to
go
to
london
yesterday
and
took
it
to
him
it
contained
a
request
to
give
me
because
i
had
gone
into
debt
sixty
pounds
the
money
was
to
be
given
in
notes
and
gold
she
brought
the
money
back
and
now
she
not
i
is
giving
it
to
indeed
said
the
man
he
started
back
he
looked
from
annie
to
leslie
i
didn
t
know
you
were
clever
enough
for
that
he
said
it
seems
to
run
in
our
mean
the
capacity
for
thieving
i
did
not
know
you
could
do
it
you
are
clever
enough
annie
and
you
have
cheek
enough
but
to
do
that
to
commit
a
forgery
and
to
drag
another
girl
in
it
was
done
for
you
and
you
of
all
people
ought
not
to
blame
her
said
leslie
you
had
cheek
repeated
colchester
he
laid
his
hand
lightly
on
his
sister
s
shoulder
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
of
course
and
you
too
don
t
know
your
you
had
better
not
know
it
i
don
t
want
you
to
yes
she
did
it
and
parker
thinks
that
i
am
guilty
do
you
quite
realize
both
of
you
what
annie
colchester
has
done
i
realize
it
fast
enough
said
colchester
but
you
are
a
merciful
girl
i
see
it
in
your
nevertheless
i
will
state
the
position
quite
plainly
your
sister
by
writing
such
a
letter
committed
annie
uttered
a
deep
groan
and
covered
her
face
after
a
moment
she
raised
her
eyes
and
glanced
at
rupert
he
was
not
looking
at
her
he
was
staring
at
leslie
try
and
keep
quiet
annie
and
allow
me
to
speak
continued
leslie
i
do
not
intend
to
betray
her
but
i
want
you
to
know
colchester
what
it
has
cost
me
it
has
nearly
driven
me
mad
think
what
it
must
mean
to
me
parker
imagines
that
i
am
the
sort
of
girl
who
will
go
into
debt
and
then
come
to
him
to
clear
me
do
you
know
that
because
of
this
he
came
to
wingfield
he
sought
me
out
he
spoke
to
me
he
was
in
the
deepest
and
confided
in
him
said
rupert
colchester
few
girls
would
be
noble
oh
you
do
her
injustice
interrupted
annie
she
has
not
told
she
has
not
betrayed
us
is
it
not
brave
of
her
i
have
not
told
said
leslie
but
i
have
had
an
awful
struggle
if
i
told
what
annie
has
really
done
it
might
get
her
into
such
fearful
trouble
that
she
would
be
ruined
she
would
have
to
leave
wode
s
her
career
would
be
practically
over
even
if
the
law
did
not
punish
her
she
would
never
do
any
good
in
this
country
again
i
have
saved
her
from
that
but
it
was
a
great
effort
i
have
come
here
colchester
to
tell
you
that
you
are
the
one
most
to
blame
i
am
going
to
keep
this
thing
to
myself
but
only
on
a
condition
this
is
the
most
bitter
moment
of
my
life
this
thing
that
annie
has
done
on
account
of
you
has
turned
both
my
present
and
my
future
into
gall
and
bitterness
i
was
the
happiest
of
girls
yesterday
now
i
am
the
most
miserable
my
best
friend
thinks
badly
of
me
and
i
can
never
set
myself
right
with
him
but
i
promise
here
willingly
before
god
that
i
will
not
tell
what
annie
has
done
if
you
on
your
part
will
make
me
a
what
is
it
said
colchester
pon
my
word
you
re
a
brave
sort
of
girl
and
i
don
t
is
short
of
ruining
it
will
not
ruin
you
it
will
save
you
i
want
you
to
promise
me
to
leave
annie
alone
in
the
annie
uttered
a
sharp
cry
but
i
don
t
wish
to
be
left
alone
she
said
i
can
not
live
without
that
you
will
leave
annie
alone
in
the
future
continued
leslie
that
you
will
never
again
take
money
from
her
that
sixty
pounds
is
my
present
to
you
i
exonerate
annie
from
all
blame
in
the
matter
she
shall
never
get
into
trouble
on
my
account
if
you
on
your
part
will
keep
your
you
are
plucky
said
colchester
he
was
impressed
by
leslie
s
manner
and
by
her
remarkable
beauty
the
moon
was
shining
full
upon
her
face
which
looked
clear
and
pale
and
unearthly
you
are
a
very
plucky
girl
he
repeated
and
annie
is
in
luck
to
have
made
you
her
friend
yes
i
am
all
right
now
this
little
girl
or
rather
you
miss
paused
but
leslie
did
not
supply
the
have
made
it
all
right
for
very
well
i
promise
not
to
tell
what
annie
has
done
if
you
make
me
a
promise
not
to
blackmail
her
blackmail
that
is
an
ugly
word
said
colchester
after
all
she
is
my
the
more
shame
on
you
to
get
your
sister
into
trouble
i
have
a
brother
do
you
think
there
i
can
not
speak
of
him
in
the
same
breath
with
you
if
you
attempt
to
blackmail
annie
any
more
i
will
tell
parker
all
about
this
matter
i
will
consider
that
the
promise
i
have
made
is
no
longer
binding
now
it
rests
with
yourself
bid
your
sister
and
oh
i
can
not
can
not
part
with
you
rupert
cried
annie
she
burst
into
a
bitter
flood
of
tears
flung
her
arms
round
her
brother
s
neck
and
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
there
is
i
would
not
do
for
you
she
sobbed
leslie
moved
away
to
a
little
distance
she
had
spoken
with
emphasis
and
spirit
but
never
in
the
whole
course
of
her
life
had
she
felt
so
cold
so
bitter
although
she
had
promised
before
god
not
to
betray
her
miserable
companion
yet
she
knew
no
sense
of
happiness
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
setting
the
seal
to
her
degradation
never
again
could
she
be
happy
always
now
there
would
be
one
person
who
would
think
of
her
as
a
girl
capable
of
any
meanness
any
smallness
any
deceit
the
mere
knowledge
that
someone
would
so
regard
her
troubled
her
so
much
that
she
wondered
if
in
the
future
she
could
lead
an
upright
life
and
why
was
she
doing
it
for
annie
did
not
appreciate
her
sacrifice
except
in
as
far
as
it
saved
rupert
and
as
to
rupert
himself
it
needed
only
to
look
into
his
face
to
see
how
weak
and
worthless
he
was
wrapped
in
the
misery
of
these
thoughts
leslie
did
not
notice
annie
until
she
came
back
and
touched
her
on
the
arm
he
can
not
praise
you
enough
you
do
not
know
what
he
has
been
saying
of
you
he
wants
to
bid
you
now
he
is
going
to
australia
he
has
made
up
his
mind
i
shall
never
see
him
there
was
a
note
of
such
utter
misery
in
annie
s
voice
that
leslie
wretched
as
she
was
started
up
and
shook
herself
let
him
go
she
said
i
do
not
want
to
speak
to
him
but
i
so
earnestly
wish
you
would
he
is
terribly
touched
by
what
you
have
done
this
may
be
the
do
come
and
shake
hands
with
i
can
not
you
can
not
leslie
do
you
think
him
as
bad
as
all
that
he
is
very
bad
annie
and
he
is
making
you
oh
indirectly
he
is
making
me
bad
too
i
can
not
go
i
can
never
touch
his
you
are
too
hard
said
annie
i
could
have
loved
you
for
what
you
have
done
but
when
you
speak
against
him
i
can
not
bear
feel
just
as
you
please
about
me
said
leslie
but
i
can
not
bid
your
brother
nor
shake
hands
with
him
come
back
to
me
when
he
has
gone
and
be
quick
we
ought
to
be
in
the
house
now
there
is
no
use
in
our
getting
into
fresh
annie
turned
slowly
away
in
about
ten
minutes
she
came
back
to
leslie
he
has
gone
she
said
he
will
take
his
passage
for
australia
i
shall
never
see
him
any
her
tone
was
cold
calm
and
low
then
let
us
return
to
the
house
said
leslie
they
went
slowly
across
the
quadrangle
entered
by
the
side
door
and
went
up
to
their
room
i
wish
i
was
not
your
roomfellow
annie
said
leslie
i
never
knew
i
could
feel
so
bitter
towards
you
will
get
over
it
dear
and
after
all
as
rupert
oh
please
don
t
mention
his
name
annie
looked
at
her
a
frown
coming
between
her
brows
i
can
not
understand
you
she
said
after
a
pause
you
are
so
noble
and
yet
you
are
so
hard
are
good
very
good
people
often
like
you
i
am
not
good
i
don
t
think
i
shall
ever
be
good
again
said
poor
leslie
she
sat
down
on
the
nearest
seat
and
covered
her
face
with
her
trembling
hands
annie
switched
on
the
electric
light
at
least
there
need
be
no
more
study
she
said
after
a
pause
leslie
did
not
take
the
slightest
notice
annie
sat
down
on
a
sofa
took
up
the
novel
she
had
been
reading
that
afternoon
and
turned
a
page
or
two
listlessly
presently
she
flung
it
down
and
uttered
a
heartrending
sigh
that
sigh
reached
leslie
she
looked
up
and
tried
to
speak
in
a
cheerful
tone
are
not
you
going
to
get
out
your
books
you
know
you
have
so
much
to
do
before
the
honor
examination
i
do
not
mean
to
study
any
more
did
not
you
hear
me
say
so
but
why
i
can
not
the
motive
for
study
has
gone
i
shall
take
my
pass
and
let
that
suffice
i
shall
leave
wingfield
at
the
end
of
but
why
should
you
give
up
everything
why
said
annie
why
she
went
over
and
stood
by
the
window
the
night
wind
came
in
and
lifted
a
tress
of
her
hair
and
played
with
it
leslie
seated
on
her
own
sofa
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
seemed
always
in
her
moments
of
bitterest
grief
in
the
future
to
see
that
tress
of
hair
tossed
up
and
down
by
the
wind
the
electric
light
in
the
room
played
on
it
and
brought
out
some
of
its
red
fire
annie
s
face
was
ghastly
pale
but
her
eyes
were
large
and
too
brilliant
for
health
why
should
you
give
up
everything
repeated
leslie
after
another
pause
why
can
t
you
understand
did
you
ever
have
a
watch
with
a
broken
spring
i
think
so
it
was
useless
was
it
not
of
course
until
it
was
well
i
am
like
that
watch
the
spring
that
guided
my
life
is
broken
and
unlike
the
watch
it
can
never
be
you
forget
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
watchmaker
even
for
the
human
watch
said
leslie
her
tone
softening
granted
but
i
shall
not
put
myself
into
his
hands
i
am
dead
tired
i
feel
numb
all
over
i
am
going
to
bed
i
want
beyond
everything
else
on
earth
to
she
threw
herself
down
on
her
bed
without
an
attempt
at
undressing
leslie
started
up
to
remonstrate
if
annie
lay
like
that
she
would
have
a
terrible
cold
in
the
morning
she
advanced
a
step
or
two
across
the
room
and
then
paused
after
all
it
does
not
matter
she
said
to
herself
i
should
not
have
got
into
this
awful
scrape
if
i
had
not
been
good
to
her
i
will
leave
her
alone
now
i
have
ruined
myself
absolutely
and
for
ever
but
i
can
not
can
not
be
friends
with
rupert
has
gone
rupert
has
gone
moaned
annie
and
my
sun
has
leslie
heard
the
words
but
even
they
did
not
soften
her
what
has
come
to
me
she
thought
has
this
trouble
turned
me
into
a
stone
chapter
xxiii
the
picnic
the
gilroy
children
were
all
in
the
wildest
state
of
excitement
it
was
a
lovely
day
in
july
and
they
were
going
off
for
a
picnic
on
the
river
leslie
was
standing
by
the
center
table
in
the
dining
room
busily
packing
a
basket
kitty
was
buttering
bread
and
making
sandwiches
mabel
was
cutting
cake
into
thick
slices
hester
was
darning
a
rent
in
the
back
of
her
dress
and
llewellyn
was
here
there
and
everywhere
we
must
start
soon
he
said
when
will
the
baskets
be
ready
i
wonder
mother
has
not
come
is
not
she
in
asked
leslie
standing
up
to
her
full
height
and
pressing
her
hand
to
her
forehead
have
you
got
one
of
your
headaches
back
again
leslie
asked
llewellyn
oh
just
a
little
very
little
but
the
air
will
do
me
good
it
will
be
lovely
on
the
yes
splendid
said
llewellyn
we
will
have
tea
at
twickenham
and
go
home
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
you
can
not
think
how
nice
old
forrest
has
been
about
this
he
gave
me
a
holiday
at
once
when
i
asked
him
this
morning
he
said
that
he
only
wished
he
kept
a
provision
shop
instead
of
a
drapery
shop
so
that
he
might
send
us
pies
and
things
for
our
but
even
though
he
does
keep
a
s
shop
said
hester
he
could
still
help
us
i
for
instance
should
not
at
all
object
to
materials
for
a
new
gown
this
old
serge
is
so
thick
and
but
if
you
put
on
a
white
shirt
dear
you
will
look
as
neat
and
nice
as
possible
said
leslie
and
won
t
be
at
all
too
oh
i
can
t
be
bothered
said
hester
shrugging
her
shoulders
i
forgot
to
send
my
shirts
to
the
wash
on
monday
and
i
have
not
one
fit
to
be
then
it
serves
you
right
if
you
are
hot
and
uncomfortable
cried
kitty
kitty
herself
was
always
the
pink
of
neatness
hester
was
evidently
the
troublesome
one
of
the
family
leslie
went
on
packing
her
basket
she
wedged
in
the
eggs
raised
pies
roast
chickens
sandwiches
and
the
sweets
at
last
the
big
basket
was
quite
full
doesn
t
it
look
tempting
said
mabel
smacking
her
lips
how
frightfully
hungry
i
ll
be
oh
don
t
forget
whatever
happens
the
other
basket
with
the
ginger
beer
and
lemonade
i
only
trust
we
have
got
and
the
cold
tea
for
mother
said
llewellyn
be
sure
you
put
that
the
boys
and
girls
chatted
eagerly
one
to
the
other
i
say
cried
kitty
isn
t
it
nice
to
have
old
leslie
back
again
we
ll
hate
it
when
you
have
to
return
to
your
grand
college
in
the
autumn
leslie
but
i
wish
she
added
you
would
talk
more
about
it
i
thought
you
d
have
no
end
of
rattling
good
stories
to
tell
us
but
you
are
as
mum
and
quiet
as
if
you
had
not
had
a
good
time
at
all
whereas
of
course
you
have
had
the
very
best
time
a
girl
could
have
i
suppose
it
is
the
weight
of
all
the
learning
that
bothers
you
and
what
about
those
chetwynds
you
wrote
to
mother
about
them
and
about
that
extraordinary
girl
belle
acheson
but
since
you
have
come
back
you
have
hardly
said
a
word
about
any
of
your
i
am
sorry
said
leslie
i
will
try
to
tell
you
something
amusing
kitty
i
don
t
want
to
make
myself
mum
and
oh
you
are
never
that
you
dear
old
darling
only
we
were
hoping
for
so
t
we
hetty
yes
said
hester
who
was
still
darning
the
rent
in
her
dress
i
do
wish
this
cotton
wouldn
t

trice

kitty

two
footsteps

possibly

next
moment
the
was
opened
and
gilroy
accompanied
by
parker
came
in
leslie
had
not
seen
parker
since
her
interview
with
him
at
wingfield
she
now
felt
herself
turning
pale
her
pallor
was
suddenly
succeeded
by
a
quick
flush
of
color
she
hoped
no
one
noticed
her
agitation
but
raising
her
eyes
she
met
those
of
llewellyn
his
wore
a
perturbed
expression
parker
after
greeting
the
other
children
came
up
to
her
and
offered
his
hand
glad
to
see
you
back
again
miss
leslie
he
said
there
was
an
indescribable
restrained
note
in
his
voice
well
children
what
do
you
say
to
my
joining
you
he
turned
and
faced
kitty
and
hester
your
mother
was
good
enough
to
invite
me
and
i
am
as
up
to
a
bit
of
frolic
as
if
i
were
as
young
as
you
where
is
little
dan
he
must
be
my
special
charge
kitty
give
me
those
sandwiches
i
can
finish
packing
them
said
leslie
in
a
low
voice
which
she
hardly
recognized
as
her
own
after
parker
s
one
which
was
firm
and
cordial
enough
he
had
turned
his
back
on
her
he
still
did
so
and
kept
on
talking
to
llewellyn
and
the
younger
children
gilroy
sat
down
on
the
sofa
it
is
very
hot
she
said
and
you
are
very
tired
said
parker
now
listen
i
am
going
to
have
my
own
way
and
nobody
shall
interfere
what
is
the
good
of
money
if
you
can
not
spend
it
now
and
then
you
want
to
go
to
richmond
turning
to
gilroy

to
richmond

shall
but

are
not
going
by

a
carriage
and
i
will
drive
you
down
a
carriage

hold
you
and
myself
and
a
couple
of
the
children
not
another
word
my
dear
friend
what
is
the
good
of
money
if
you
can
not
have
a
treat
but
you
do
far
too
much
for
us
parker
replied
gilroy
far
too
much
he
answered
tut
tut
not
a
bit
of
it
i
am
a
lonely
man
madam
my
one
interest
in
life
is
you
and
your
here
he
glanced
at
leslie
but
the
next
moment
looked
away
there
was
disapproval
in
his
face
leslie
started
up
impulsively
all
the
provisions
were
packed
yes
mother
she
cried
do
let
parker
drive
you
it
will
do
you
no
end
of
all
right
darling
i
have
not
the
least
objection
if
you
will
come
with
us
i
need
not
ask
you
parker
if
you
will
object
to
leslie
being
one
of
the
party
in
the
carriage
dan
shall
sit
on
my
knee
said
parker
and
two
of
the
children
can
be
crowded
in
just
as
miss
leslie
likes
of
but
leslie
had
left
the
room
she
called
llewellyn
to
follow
her
he
hurried
out
what
is
the
matter
with
you
leslie
he
said
my
head
is
very
bad
i
can
not
go
to
the
leslie
you
will
upset
us
all
and
as
to
listen
lew
i
can
not
give
you
any
reason
but
neither
can
i
go
and
i
want
you
to
help
but
i
fail
to
understand
you
were
full
of
going
a
moment
i
know
but
with
a
headache
like
mine
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
rest
and
quiet
do
help
me
please
i
am
most
anxious
that
mother
should
have
this
one
delightful
happy
day
let
kitty
and
mabel
go
in
the
carriage
and
dan
too
if
there
is
room
and
will
you
take
hester
by
train
let
mother
think
that
i
am
coming
with
you
then
when
you
meet
by
the
river
you
must
just
tell
her
that
i
had
a
bad
headache
and
was
obliged
to
stay
at
home
i
can
not
go
lew
there
is
no
use
in
coaxing
me
and
i
do
not
wish
mother
to
know
until
she
gets
to
well
of
course
i
ll
manage
it
if
it
must
be
managed
said
llewellyn
but
i
can
not
imagine
what
is
up
i
am
certain
it
is
more
than
a
mere
headache
but
of
course
leslie
i
have
no
intention
of
forcing
your
don
t
like
a
darling
said
leslie
she
touched
him
on
the
arm
and
looked
into
his
face
then
you
are
in
trouble
dear
old
girl
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
yes
but
you
can
not
help
me
to
bear
it
it
is
something
which
i
must
not
tell
to
anyone
i
must
just
bear
my
burden
alone
do
not
ask
me
any
i
won
t
and
i
ll
manage
things
for
you
run
upstairs
now
and
keep
quiet
i
ll
tell
mother
when
we
get
to
richmond
that
you
were
a
bit
seedy
but
that
a
few
hours
of
rest
will
put
you
he
hurried
off
and
a
few
moments
later
leslie
from
her
window
saw
the
carriage
party
get
under
way
soon
afterwards
llewellyn
and
hester
started
off
for
the
railway
station
leslie
found
herself
alone
she
sat
down
by
her
window
and
tried
to
face
the
position
it
had
not
been
the
first
time
she
had
made
a
gallant
effort
to
do
so
what
am
i
to
do
she
said
now
to
herself
but
the
answer
came
quickly
live
it
down
was
the
reply
of
her
heart
be
true
to
your
sense
of
honor
save
your
friend
if
you
can
bear
the
terrible
and
cruel
position
in
which
you
are
placed
trust
to
god
putting
things
but
the
dreadful
part
of
it
is
thought
poor
leslie
that
he
is
making
me
so
hard
i
almost
hate
annie
colchester
i
did
not
know
it
was
in
me
to
feel
so
bad
about
anything
there
is
one
thing
certain
i
shall
never
be
able
to
endure
parker
s
eyes
i
shall
have
to
leave
the
room
or
the
house
when
he
comes
to
see
us
there
i
must
not
sit
still
any
longer
poor
darling
lew
he
little
knows
what
i
am
really
early
in
the
afternoon
there
came
a
ring
at
the
front
door
and
who
should
be
seen
standing
on
the
threshold
but
the
figure
of
belle
acheson
leslie
ran
to
let
her
in
how
lucky
that
i
was
in
she
said
please
come
into
the
dining
room
so
this
is
your
domicile
said
belle
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
up
at
the
windows
then
glancing
round
the
walls
finally
settled
them
on
the
carpet
at
her
feet
neat
but
not
gaudy
she
said
not
much
to
complain
of
when
all
is
said
and
done
how
do
you
do
she
held
out
her
hand
to
her
friend
leslie
grasped
it
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
said
leslie
i
am
all
alone
for
mother
and
all
the
children
are
on
the
and
you
you
dear
faithful
soul
have
stayed
at
home
to
go
on
with
your
literary
studies
exclaimed
belle
her
eyes
gleaming
not
a
bit
of
it
belle
you
must
not
think
me
better
than
i
deserve
i
stayed
at
home
to
to
mope
surely
you
are
not
regretting
having
put
your
hand
to
the
plow
you
are
not
looking
back
leslie
i
could
never
have
thought
it
of
you
i
am
not
looking
back
belle
i
am
still
as
fond
as
ever
of
my
studies
but
at
the
present
moment
i
am
not
thinking
of
literature
nor
of
college
life
at
all
sit
down
how
hot
you
look
the
day
is
such
a
sultry
hot
said
belle
is
it
perhaps
i
am
hot
i
don
t
know
does
heat
matter
that
is
the
she
flung
off
her
hat
and
let
it
tumble
on
the
floor
her
brow
was
wet
with
perspiration
no
physical
discomforts
seem
to
matter
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
said
leslie
with
a
smile
i
do
not
feel
physical
suffering
said
belle
that
is
the
truth
my
mind
is
wrapped
in
meditation
and
thoughts
of
the
future
i
long
for
this
tiresome
holiday
to
be
at
an
end
i
have
one
comfort
however
my
money
is
continuing
to
heap
up
when
i
finish
my
collegiate
career
i
shall
have
quite
enough
to
open
my
hostel
i
shall
call
it
a
hostel
for
the
lovers
of
pure
literature
i
am
sure
it
will
do
well
it
will
supply
a
but
leslie
was
not
in
the
humor
to
talk
about
the
hostel
just
then
i
have
a
great
deal
to
worry
me
just
now
continued
belle
mother
has
so
little
sympathy
i
have
no
consolation
but
one
or
two
best
of
friends
by
the
way
leslie
you
don
t
look
too
bright
yourself
your
brow
has
quite
a
haggard
look
i
am
certain
although
you
will
not
acknowledge
it
that
you
are
missing
wode
in
many
ways
i
am
oh
this
is
delicious
said
belle
she
hopped
up
from
her
seat
and
drew
a
chair
close
to
leslie
does
your
mother
object
to
your
studies
she
said
does
no
belle
you
don
t
understand
my
mother
i
only
wish
you
could
meet
her
my
trouble
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
studies
i
have
a
care
that
i
can
not
confide
to
pray
don
t
at
least
never
confide
in
me
it
is
the
last
thing
i
wish
to
recipient
of
another
person
s
secrets
i
either
forget
what
i
am
told
or
i
blurt
it
out
to
the
next
person
i
come
across
you
had
better
let
your
worry
go
that
s
my
let
it
go
i
wish
i
you
can
if
you
will
do
what
i
ask
absorb
yourself
in
work
cease
to
fret
about
mere
externals
what
do
they
matter
heat
cold
worry
pain
even
nothing
matters
if
one
can
but
grasp
the
riches
of
the
but
what
about
the
riches
of
the
future
belle
you
are
so
fond
of
looking
back
do
you
never
look
forward
forward
said
belle
yes
i
sometimes
do
i
look
forward
to
the
time
when
frivols
will
be
exterminated
forever
when
the
drones
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
must
die
out
leslie
dear
would
you
feel
inclined
to
hear
me
recite
some
verses
of
my
own
this
morning
i
have
been
in
the
poetic
mood
for
the
last
few
days
and
last
night
the
poet
s
frenzy
really
seized
me
my
lines
begin
with
delve
delve
deeply
i
don
t
think
i
quite
follow
said
leslie
quite
follow
but
it
is
so
simple
the
metaphor
refers
to
a
miner
the
gold
is
beneath
he
delves
he
obtains
his
joy
is
but
i
am
not
in
the
humor
for
poetry
the
fact
is
i
am
not
in
the
humor
to
be
anything
but
now
that
i
do
not
believe
but
i
will
keep
my
verses
until
they
are
quite
finished
each
stanza
correct
the
swing
the
meter
perfect
by
the
way
have
you
seen
the
chetwynds
since
they
came
down
i
hear
that
eileen
has
taken
some
dreadful
disease
exploring
in
back
slums
her
mother
is
in
a
terrible
but
is
eileen
really
ill
asked
leslie
starting
up
so
i
have
heard
they
say
she
is
rather
bad
oh
my
dear
it
is
only
the
body
pray
don
t
worry
but
belle
this
is
intolerable
we
can
not
do
without
our
bodies
while
we
live
poor
eileen
ill
what
did
you
say
fever
i
do
not
know
that
i
did
but
it
is
or
typhus
or
something
of
that
sort
i
didn
t
quite
catch
the
name
it
may
be
smallpox
but
i
don
t
think
belle
you
are
intolerable
you
have
no
intolerable
said
belle
now
my
dear
leslie
for
goodness
sake
don
t
get
commonplace
you
may
be
quite
certain
that
eileen
has
the
best
doctors
and
the
best
nurses
which
london
can
afford
does
it
help
her
that
you
should
have
that
flush
on
your
cheeks
and
that
frown
between
your
brows
does
it
help
her
that
you
should
abuse
me
all
this
emotion
is
of
i
am
sorry
but
i
must
give
it
said
leslie
dear
marjorie
how
she
will
feel
it
i
must
go
and
inquire
after
eileen
i
thought
you
were
not
well
i
have
a
headache
but
what
does
that
matter
i
must
go
to
see
marjorie
immediately
and
to
hear
about
if
you
want
to
make
your
inquiries
properly
said
belle
go
by
the
underground
it
is
so
hot
that
you
will
feel
yourself
a
real
martyr
put
on
your
thickest
coat
and
your
heaviest
hat
and
then
you
will
really
enjoy
yourself
i
am
going
away
as
i
see
it
is
your
wish
i
will
come
another
day
when
you
feel
more
like
the
leslie
gilroy
whom
i
used
to
admire
at
wode
i
will
never
be
the
leslie
that
you
admired
if
you
wish
me
not
to
give
sympathy
to
those
in
trouble
replied
leslie
she
ran
upstairs
put
on
her
hat
took
up
her
gloves
and
went
out
chapter
xxiv
the
twins
leslie
arrived
at
the
chetwynds
house
to
see
the
street
outside
covered
with
straw
the
knocker
to
the
door
was
muffled
she
rang
the
bell
the
footman
replied
to
her
summons
said
that
miss
eileen
was
very
ill
indeed
and
that
he
did
not
believe
the
young
lady
could
be
admitted
but
if
she
particularly
wished
it
he
would
go
and
inquire
he
was
just
stepping
on
tiptoe
across
the
hall
when
a
face
was
pushed
outside
a
door
and
the
next
moment
lettie
rushed
up
to
leslie
oh
do
come
in
leslie
she
cried
i
am
so
lonely
and
miserable
and
it
would
be
an
immense
comfort
to
see
anyone
yes
eileen
is
very
ill
very
ill
indeed
the
doctor
says
that
the
typhoid
is
running
a
most
severe
course
and
there
are
complications
a
chance
of
pneumonia
if
you
know
what
that
means
come
in
do
i
know
aunt
helen
won
t
mind
my
asking
you
in
and
as
to
oh
it
is
poor
marjorie
i
am
so
terribly
anxious
about
said
leslie
how
is
she
bearing
up
they
are
so
devoted
to
each
well
really
leslie
to
be
plain
with
you
marjorie
is
in
a
very
extraordinary
state
she
simply
won
t
be
reasonable
none
of
us
can
make
her
out
and
the
doctors
are
terribly
annoyed
with
her
she
can
not
be
got
to
leave
eileen
s
room
we
can
not
drag
her
away
poor
aunt
helen
is
in
a
perfectly
terrible
state
about
her
her
face
is
completely
changed
she
won
t
eat
anything
and
only
drops
off
to
sleep
when
she
is
too
tired
to
stay
awake
for
a
moment
leslie
if
anything
happens
to
eileen
marjorie
will
but
surely
lettie
eileen
can
not
be
so
bad
as
all
that
she
is
very
bad
indeed
i
can
tell
you
i
don
t
think
she
can
be
much
worse
there
were
two
doctors
here
this
morning
and
there
are
two
nurses
a
day
and
a
night
nurse
on
duty
and
now
ericson
wants
to
call
in
a
third
eileen
took
that
horrible
fever
in
the
buildings
where
the
coachman
lives
not
a
doubt
of
but
i
didn
t
know
that
typhoid
fever
was
really
infectious
said
leslie
in
the
ordinary
sense
it
is
not
but
a
whole
family
were
down
with
it
in
a
block
and
eileen
would
go
to
the
house
and
she
was
very
hot
and
thirsty
and
they
gave
her
some
water
to
drink
and
now
it
seems
that
all
that
water
was
terribly
contaminated
it
had
some
of
those
queer
little
things
they
call
bacilli
in
it
and
ericson
said
they
were
the
bacilli
of
typhoid
fever
how
puzzling
these
modern
scientific
names
are
lettie
sank
into
an
easy
chair
and
invited
leslie
to
one
by
her
side
the
fever
is
not
infectious
to
us
you
know
she
continued
and
that
in
a
kind
of
way
is
a
comfort
eileen
began
to
be
poorly
and
not
herself
a
week
ago
now
she
is
very
ill
and
quite
unconscious
and
yet
the
very
worst
stage
of
the
fever
is
yet
to
come
you
can
not
imagine
the
state
poor
aunt
helen
is
i
earnestly
wish
i
could
help
said
leslie
well
you
are
helping
when
you
come
to
see
me
for
i
do
want
cheering
up
dreadfully
belle
acheson
was
here
for
a
moment
or
two
this
morning
what
a
terrible
girl
she
is
i
like
her
replied
leslie
i
think
she
has
a
great
deal
in
her
she
at
least
is
thoroughly
out
of
the
i
grant
you
that
answered
lettie
but
preserve
me
from
such
uncommon
people
give
me
the
everyday
sort
of
character
not
she
added
that
i
feel
unkindly
towards
her
and
i
really
did
try
to
take
compassion
on
her
unfortunate
wardrobe
but
that
perhaps
was
because
i
did
not
like
the
respectability
of
our
dear
old
hall
to
be
damaged
by
her
thoroughly
disreputable
appearance
dear
dear
added
lettie
sighing
gently
how
far
away
all
that
time
seems
now
we
looked
forward
so
much
to
the
long
vacation
and
see
what
has
so
terribly
just
at
that
moment
the
room
door
was
opened
and
chetwynd
entered
she
had
never
seen
leslie
before
and
rather
resented
her
intrusion
on
the
scene
my
dear
lettie
she
said
i
wish
you
would
go
up
to
marjorie
for
i
can
not
quiet
her
she
has
left
the
for
a
wonder
and
gone
into
her
own
and
there
she
has
broken
down
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
i
tremble
lest
her
cries
and
groans
should
reach
eileen
s
ears
perhaps
this
young
did
not
catch
her
miss
miss
gilroy
under
the
circumstances
you
will
excuse
yes
aunt
helen
i
will
go
up
said
lettie
but
i
don
t
think
i
shall
be
of
the
least
use
i
seem
to
have
lost
all
power
of
soothing
or
helping
either
of
the
girls
when
i
was
with
them
at
school
they
rather
deferred
to
my
opinion
on
certain
matters
but
now
all
things
are
don
t
stand
talking
there
dear
do
go
said
chetwynd
i
will
go
of
course
but
i
warn
you
i
shan
t
be
the
least
scrap
of
use
leslie
it
was
kind
of
you
to
call
miss
gilroy
is
one
of
our
special
chums
at
college
aunt
helen
and
a
great
friend

of

that
case

down
for
a
minute
or
two
miss
gilroy
now
run
lettie
please
don
t
wait
another
lettie
left
the
room
and
chetwynd
stared
at
leslie
leslie
returned
her
gaze
with
one
frank
and
sympathetic
i
am
so
truly
sorry
for
you
she
said
in
her
soft
voice
her
brown
eyes
gazed
full
into
chetwynd
s
agitated
face
and
i
know
what
illness
means
continued
leslie
very
softly
for

your
pardon
i
mean
my
dear
was
terribly
ill
once
almost
at
death
s
door

life

anxious

to
inquire
if

leslie
certainly
if
you
the
widow
spoke
in
an
indifferent
tone
she
opened
the
door
and
leslie
was
just
going
into
the
hall
when
lettie
rushed
downstairs
marjorie
wants
you
leslie
you
are
to
go
straight
up
to
her
this
marjorie
wishes
to
see
miss
gilroy
interrupted
chetwynd
yes
aunt
helen
and
a
very
good
thing
too
i
just
happened
to
mention
that
leslie
had
called
and
marjorie
said
at
once
she
must
see
her
that
no
one
in
all
the
world
could
do
her
so
much
good
go
up
to
her
leslie

t
waste

said
leslie
looking
anxiously
at
chetwynd
oh
certainly
dear
if
she
wishes
it
but
i
must
come
come
leslie
there
is
not
a
minute
to
lose
said
lettie
they
flew
upstairs
together
and
a
moment
later
had
entered
marjorie
s
room
marjorie
had
flung
herself
face
downwards
on
the
bed
she
was
wearing
an
untidy
serge
skirt
and
a
loose
washing
blouse
her
tangled
short
hair
was
waved
like
a
mop
over
her
head
she
did
not
look
up
when
she
heard
the
two
girls
enter
the
room
and
when
leslie
s
soft
voice
said
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
her
only
reply
was
to
clutch
the
pillow
round
which
she
had
clasped
her
arms
more
convulsively
than
ever
and
to
say
in
a
choking
voice
i
wish
lettie
would
go
away
i
know
she
is
in
the
room
too
i
want
to
be
alone
with
you
lettie
raised
her
brows
made
a
pantomimic
sign
to
leslie
to
show
how
badly
she
was
appreciated
and
stole
on
tiptoe
out
of
the
room
has
she
gone
asked
marjorie
still
keeping
her
face
hidden
well
shut
the
door
won
t
you
leslie
did
so
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
oh
marjorie
is
that
right
to
your
mother
i
won
t
see
mother
and
i
won
t
see
lettie
lock
the
door
will
you
at
once
leslie
instantly
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
when
she
had
done
so
marjorie
sat
up
pushed
the
hair
from
her
forehead
and
looked
at
leslie
from
between
her
swollen
eyelids
i
feel
so
dazed
she
said
her
face
was
red
and
inflamed
in
parts
and
deadly
white
in
other
parts
her
eyes
had
sunk
into
her
head
and
their
color
was
almost
washed
away
with
violent
weeping
oh
come
close
leslie
she
said
suddenly
stretching
out
her
arms
let
me
lean
against
leslie
went
up
to
her
she
clasped
her
own
strong
arms
round
her
laid
the
tired
flushed
face
against
her
breast
pushed
back
the
hair
with
one
of
her
hands
and
began
gently
to
stroke
the
hot
cheek
there
darling
there
said
leslie
she
did
not
say
anything
more
not
even
i
am
sorry
for
you
but
she
kept
on
repeating
the
there
darling
there
until
marjorie
like
a
tired
baby
closed
her
eyes
and
actually
dropped
off
to
sleep
leslie
sat
motionless
bearing
the
weight
of
the
tired
girl
s
head
on
her
shoulder
marjorie
slept
for
about
ten
minutes
then
with
a
violent
start
she
looked
up
saw
leslie
and
clutched
hold
of
her
with
a
fierce
strain
oh
i
have
had
such
an
awful
dream
she
said
i
thought
you
were
here
but
that
you
would
not
stay
and
that
eileen
was
lying
on
the
bed
dead
and
that
you
would
not
let
me
touch
her
oh
i
am
glad
it
was
a
dream
and
that
you
are
here
you
will
stay
now
won
t
you
i
can
just
bear
to
be
away
from
eileen
when
you
are
here
for
you
are
not
like
others
you
seem
to
understand
will
you
go
and
find
mother
and
ask
her
to
let
you
stay
with
me
could
we
not
ring
the
bell
and
tell
the
servant
and
perhaps
your
mother
would
come
here
but
i
won
t
have
her
in
the
room
she
does
worry
me
so
she
is
in
great
trouble
too
said
leslie
you
ought
to
be
kind
to
her
oh
don
t
begin
to
lecture
me
i
can
t
stand
it
you
must
let
me
have
my
own
way
now
whatever
happens
in
the
future
you
have
come
here
of
your
own
will
and
go
you
shan
i
will
stay
with
you
if
it
will
really
comfort
you
said
leslie
what
you
want
more
than
anything
else
is
a
long
quiet
sleep
and
you
must
have
it
lie
down
i
will
go
and
find
your
marjorie
flopped
down
again
on
the
bed
seized
the
pillow
clasped
it
in
her
arms
and
buried
her
head
in
it
leslie
unlocked
the
door
and
went
out
on
the
landing
a
faint
smell
of
carbolic
and
greeted
her
she
stood
for
a
moment
hesitating
as
she
did
so
a
nurse
came
out
of
the
i
saw
you
standing
there
and
thought
perhaps
you
wanted
something
she
said
yes
i
want
to
find
chetwynd
replied
leslie
in
a
low
voice
she
is
in
her
room
and
i
hope
asleep
perhaps
i
can
do
something
for
you
i
wished
to
see
her
i
have
a
message
from
poor
child
i
trust
she
is
becoming
more
reasonable
what
does
she
want
may
i
ask
she
wishes
me
very
much
indeed
to
stay
with
her
she
thinks
she
can
bear
to
be
away
from
eileen
if
i
am
then
for
heaven
s
sake
do
grant
her
request
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
awaken
poor
chetwynd
to
tell
her
this
in
the
interest
of
my
patient
i
take
upon
myself
the
responsibility
of
giving
you
permission
to
stay
do
you
need
any
clothes
we
can
send
a
messenger
i
must
write
to
my
mother
who
will
send
me
what
i
require
replied
leslie
very
well
i
will
go
back
to
marjorie
now
you
are
quite
certain
that
chetwynd
won
t
mind
mind
she
will
bless
please
please
nurse
tell
me
before
i
go
how
eileen
really
is
the
nurse
shook
her
head
she
is
very
ill
indeed
she
answered
do
you
mean
said
leslie
turning
pale
that
there
is
danger
don
t
ask
me
said
the
nurse
we
are
doing
what
we
can
for
her
but
in
god
s
hand
alone
are
the
issues
of
she
stole
back
to
the
and
leslie
returned
to
marjorie
marjorie
was
now
sitting
up
on
the
bed
her
chin
rested
on
her
hands
her
eyes
with
a
startled
strained
look
in
them
turned
slowly
to
leslie
when
she
entered
the
room
i
heard
you
talking
to
nurse
she
said
did
nothing
special
dear
except
that
she
was
sure
i
might
stay
here
i
could
not
find
your
mother
and
nurse
took
the
responsibility
of
giving
me
oh
of
course
you
may
stay
it
is
not
that
i
mean
but
did
she
tell
you
about
eileen
i
asked
her
if
eileen
were
in
danger
said
leslie
and
she
said
we
are
doing
all
we
can
for
her
but
in
god
s
hands
are
the
issues
of
oh
then
it
is
hopeless
said
marjorie
always
thought
it
she
got
off
the
bed
as
she
spoke
she
was
trembling
so
excessively
that
she
nearly
fell
leslie
went
up
and
tried
to
put
her
arm
round
her
waist
don
t
touch
me
said
marjorie
i
can
t
bear
anyone
to
touch
me
now
it
is
all
too
true
they
have
been
trying
to
keep
the
truth
from
me
did
i
not
read
it
in
their
faces
even
the
doctors
have
deceived
me
leslie
oh
leslie
if
you
saw
her
now
you
would
not
know
marjorie
came
up
close
to
leslie
as
she
spoke
her
face
is
so
sunken
and
oh
so
white
and
her
eyes
so
very
big
you
know
what
lovely
eyes
eileen
always
soft
in
expression
so
full
of
the
soul
which
animated
all
she
ever
did
or
thought
or
said
but
now
leslie
now
if
you
could
see
have
a
sort
of
she
was
always
unearthly
and
now
she
is
going
away
she
is
going
to
the
better
and
the
spiritual
world
and
i
oh
leslie
i
can
t
bear
marjorie
turned
away
walked
to
the
window
rested
her
elbow
on
the
sill
and
looked
out
i
can
not
can
not
bear
it
she
repeated
at
intervals
leslie
remained
motionless
for
a
few
minutes
she
was
thinking
hard
of
course
she
said
after
a
long
pause
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
only
one
i
know
what
you
mean
i
am
to
quiet
myself
to
crush
back
my
misery
my
despair
yes
i
ll
do
it
i
ll
wash
my
face
and
hands
and
make
my
hair
tidy
and
go
back
to
her
again
she
never
loved
anyone
in
all
the
world
as
she
loved
me
i
am
her
twin
you
know
and
twins
are
so
close
to
each
other
fifty
times
closer
than
the
ordinary
brother
and
sister
i
ll
go
back
to
her
and
i
ll
stay
so
quiet
that
even
the
nurses
won
t
have
anything
to
complain
of
you
need
not
remain
in
this
house
after
all
leslie
for
i
can
not
be
with
you
i
must
return
to
my
and
by
so
doing
be
dreadfully
selfish
and
injure
her
said
leslie
selfish
and
injure
her
repeated
marjorie
yes
injure
her
and
take
away
the
faint
chance
there
may
be
of
her
but
you
can
not
mean
that
leslie
what
possible
harm
can
i
do
her
how
perfectly
ridiculous
you
are
i
injure
my
own
eileen
why
do
you
speak
in
that
way
it
is
impossible
that
i
could
injure
i
know
you
will
injure
her
if
you
go
back
you
don
t
look
natural
marjorie
you
must
try
to
subdue
your
emotion
you
are
much
too
flushed
your
eyes
are
too
full
of
anxiety
the
very
tone
of
your
voice
is
all
strain
now
eileen
ought
to
have
no
anxious
person
in
her
room
so
much
depends
on
all
that
sort
of
thing
being
kept
out
of
the
sickroom
and
dear
s
voice
shook
i
don
t
know
that
i
ought
to
say
it
and
yet
i
is
one
thing
to
be
speak
how
mysterious
you
are
let
us
pray
for
her
marjorie
let
us
ask
god
to
save
her
it
is
all
in
his
hands
let
us
ask
him
to
spare
her
marjorie
stared
at
leslie
then
she
clutched
hold
of
her
hand
squeezed
it
and
said
eagerly
do
you
think
he
will
i
can
not
say
but
we
might
try
he
will
if
it
is
then
let
us
go
straight
off
to
a
church
and
ask
him
i
always
feel
as
if
i
could
pray
better
in
a
yes
we
will
go
at
once
said
leslie
chapter
xxv
the
prayer
of
faith
in
her
shabby

the
marks
of

still
round
her
eyes
her
cheeks

her
short
hair
tossed
marjorie
chetwynd
ran
downstairs
accompanied
by
leslie

still
lying
in
her
room
trying
to
have
a
little
rest
lettie
was
writing
letters
to
anxious
friends
the
girls

just
opened
the
door
when
they
saw

steps
how

she
now
said
belle

the
way

rather
bad

t

about

t
matter

marjorie
don

as
ill
as
she
can
be
and
i
am
going
to
pray

only
thing
to

more

replied
belle
quietly
she
turned
at
once
and
the
girls
walked
down
the
street
side
by
side
there
was
a
church
at
the
farther
end
of
the
square
a
church
which
was
open
all
day
to
those
who
needed
it
the
three
girls
entered
it
was
hot
outside
but
here
it
was
still
and
cool
they
walked
up
the
aisle
and
turned
into
one
of
the
pews
and
knelt
down
marjorie
knelt
in
the
middle
her
head
was
pressed
upon
her
hands
leslie
had
always
found
prayer
easy
in
her
short
life
she
had
prayed
a
good
deal
finding
prayer
the
greatest
support
in
each
hour
of
trial
but
of
late
since
her
own
great
trouble
had
come
she
had
almost
forgotten
to
pray
and
now
it
seemed
difficult
it
was
not
until
she
ceased
to
remember
herself
and
thought
only
of
her
friend
that
her
words
went
up
to
god
at
first
in
broken
utterances
then
more
earnestly
and
more
full
of
faith
a
low
sob
came
from
marjorie
s
lips
this
sob
was
echoed
by
leslie
belle
had
taken
up
a
had
opened
it
and
was
reading
in
a
some
of
the
prayers
for
the
sick
after
a
very
few
moments
marjorie
rose
to
her
feet
i
have
prayed
she
said
i
have
told
god
exactly
what
i
want
he
will
hear
he
must
it
would
be
wrong
cruel
monstrous
for
eileen
beautiful
eileen
to
die
come
home
now
leslie
she
continued
the
three
left
the
church
as
silently
as
they
had
entered
it
was
not
until
they
reached
marjorie
s
door
that
belle
spoke
marjorie
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
i
will
call
again
but
before
i
go
tell
tell
you
seriously
believe
in
all
this
said
hesitated
the
look
of
peace
which
had
dawned
upon
her
worn
and
anxious
face
left
it
before
she
could
reply
leslie
answered
with
flashing
eyes
marjorie
believes
or
she
could
not
have
prayed
as
she
did
and
of
course
i
believe
she
continued
i
believe
in
a
god
and
that
he
answers
i
wonder
if
he
will
said
belle
with
a
queer
new
sort
of
expression
on
her
face
it
will
be
very
strange
i
shall
be
most
curious
to
know
she
turned
and
walked
down
the
street
when
she
had
gone
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
she
turned
back
and
called
out
to
the
other
girls
who
were
still
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
house
i
will
come
to
find
out
it
will
be
very
curious
if
it
is
true
it
will
make
an
immense
difference
to
then
she
walked
on
swaying
slightly
from
side
to
side
marjorie
put
her
hand
quickly
to
her
forehead
i
never
felt
less
in
sympathy
with
belle
than
i
do
at
this
moment
she
said
now
you
leslie
really
soothe
me
it
was
nice
to
feel
you
kneeling
by
my
side
it
seemed
to
me
that
some
of
your
faith
came
to
me
i
do
not
feel
nearly
so
unhappy
now
not
so
restless
nor
so
leslie
kissed
her
i
can
understand
that
she
said
you
have
put
the
matter
into
god
s
are
resting
on
god
that
is
the
reason
why
you
do
not
feel
so
the
girls
entered
the
little
boudoir
which
chetwynd
had
so
carefully
prepared
for
her
darlings
lettie
was
seated
by
the
window
where
have
you
both
been
she
cried
i
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
aunt
helen
is
in
a
painful
state
of
what
about
well
nurse
did
not
much
like
eileen
s
state
and
ericson
came
in
a
hurry
and
he
says
he
wishes
another
doctor
to
be
called
in
one
of
the
very
great
specialists
the
doctor
is
coming
almost
immediately
aunt
helen
says
we
are
none
of
us
to
go
upstairs
there
is
to
be
the
most
absolute
quiet
and
fresh
straw
has
been
ordered
to
be
put
down
in
the
street
leslie
are
you
really
going
to
stay
here
she
certainly
is
said
marjorie
i
wouldn
t
part
with
her
on
any
i
will
write
a
line
to
mother
if
you
will
allow
me
said
leslie
of
course
if
i
can
be
of
the
least
use
to
marjorie
i
shall
be
glad
to
here
is
paper
if
you
want
it
said
lettie
i
am
very
glad
you
are
staying
for
my
leslie
wrote
a
short
note
when
it
was
finished
lettie
took
it
from
the
room
i
can
not
sympathize
with
lettie
either
said
marjorie
when
lettie
had
gone
then
she
sat
down
by
the
window
and
did
not
speak
any
more
sometimes
she
closed
her
eyes
and
sometimes
leslie
who
had
taken
up
a
book
and
was
trying
to
read
fancied
she
saw
her
lips
moving
was
she
once
again
praying
to
god
was
faith
the
first
real
faith
she
had
ever
known
truly
visiting
her
heart
and
helping
her
through
this
dark
hour
of
tribulation
chetwynd
did
not
come
downstairs
again
and
presently
the
footman
appeared
and
told
the
girls
that
dinner
was
ready
i
can
not
eat
said
marjorie
eat
when
all
that
makes
life
valuable
hangs
in
the
balance
but
you
must
eat
dear
said
leslie
you
will
feel
much
worse
if
you
do
not
come
with
do
marjorie
try
not
to
be
such
a
humbug
said
lettie
in
an
almost
cross
voice
you
don
t
know
how
you
add
to
the
trouble
of
everybody
when
you
go
on
in
that
silly
way
first
of
all
leslie
she
absolutely
immured
herself
in
eileen
s
room
refused
to
leave
it
day
or
night
and
distracted
poor
aunt
helen
and
the
nurse
and
now
that
she
has
come
out
of
the
room
she
is
doing
her
utmost
to
make
herself
don
t
say
any
more
cried
marjorie
i
will
come
her
face
was
white
as
death
the
three
girls
entered
the
dining
room
leslie
s
persuasions
joined
perhaps
to
some
of
lettie
s
tarter
remarks
induced
marjorie
to
take
a
little
food
but
the
oppression
and
solemnity
of
the
scene
seemed
to
have
got
into
the
air
presently
the
sound
of
wheels
muffled
as
they
drove
over
the
straw
was
distinctly
heard
and
then
two
doctors
broughams
drew
up
at
the
door
ericson
got
out
of
his
and
an
elderly
man
out
of
the
other
they
both
entered
the
house
what
shall
i
do
cried
marjorie
i
can
not
stand
oh
i
feel
somehow
it
will
be
all
right
and
remember
we
have
prayed
about
it
said
leslie
she
went
up
to
marjorie
come
back
to
the
boudoir
she
said
you
are
nearer
to
her
well
i
shall
stay
here
said
lettie
i
don
t
know
what
there
is
about
you
leslie
and
about
marjorie
but
the
pair
of
you
make
me
feel
quite
nervous
we
are
doing
all
we
is
aunt
helen
is
and
really
i
do
think
that
one
ought
to
try
to
retain
a
little
strength
of
mind
if
the
very
worst
of
all
had
happened
you
could
not
be
going
on
more
terribly
than
you
are
at
present
i
can
not
help
feeling
if
that
is
what
you
mean
said
marjorie
she
went
upstairs
and
leslie
followed
her
the
noise
of
people
walking
overhead
was
heard
they
are
in
her
room
now
said
marjorie
she
clutched
hold
of
leslie
still
tighter
oh
leslie
what
should
i
do
if
you
were
not
with
me
you
know
she
is
my
twin
no
one
was
ever
quite
so
near
to
me
we
think
the
same
we
do
everything
the
same
all
our
pursuits
all
our
desires
are
the
same
i
can
not
live
without
her
if
she
dies
i
shall
but
she
shall
not
die
dear
oh
i
know
but
she
is
in
such
terrible
danger
now
you
said
leslie
that
if
it
were
good
for
her
god
would
spare
and
he
will
marjorie
can
not
you
try
to
understand
if
it
is
best
for
her
to
go
to
god
he
will
not
leave
her
in
the
world
just
because
you
selfishly
wish
it
but
it
may
be
best
for
her
to
stay
here
she
may
have
much
to
do
yet
in
her
life
on
if
she
is
spared
i
shall
become
religious
at
once
said
marjorie
leslie
could
not
help
smiling
were
you
not
religious
before
she
asked
oh
after
a
fashion
but
never
the
real
thing
eileen
and
i
both
professed
a
little
and
eileen
the
darling
was
i
believe
in
earnest
but
i
don
t
think
i
ever
was
i
wanted
of
course
to
lead
a
useful
life
and
i
thought
myself
very
much
better
than
mother
or
acheson
i
believe
now
that
i
was
selfish
about
mother
perhaps
we
both
were
even
darling
eileen
but
you
know
she
always
did
what
i
did
i
was
the
first
to
suggest
a
thing
and
then
eileen
followed
suit
if
we
were
selfish
she
was
not
to
blame
leslie
leslie
the
doctors
are
coming
downstairs
i
wonder
if
they
will
tell
us
anything
i
know
mother
won
t
for
a
long
long
i
ll
go
and
ask
then
said
leslie
jumping
up
she
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
stepped
on
to
the
landing
the
two
doctors
came
downstairs
and
what
young
lady
is
this
said
howard
pausing
for
a
moment
and
looking
at
her
he
was
a
tall
and
very
man
with
white
hair
and
dark
eyes
i
want
to
know
said
paused
marjorie
had
not
dared
to
come
out
of
the
boudoir
i
want
to
know
the
there
hope
are
you
the
sister
of
the
young
lady
asked
the
medical
man
no
only
a
great
friend
but
her
sister
her
twin
sister
is
in
the
other
room
and
she
wants
to
know
and
can
not
find
i
understand
too
upset
to
ask
poor
girl
said
the
doctor
ericson
if
you
will
permit
me
i
ll
go
in
and
see
that
young
oh
how
kind
of
you
said
leslie
she
opened
the
door
and
both
doctors
went
in
marjorie
had
flung
herself
down
in
a
chair
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
now
my
dear
girl
what
is
this
said
howard
we
shall
be
having
two
patients
instead
of
one
if
this
sort
of
thing
goes
on
give
me
your
hand
i
assure
you
ericson
this
young
lady
s
pulse
is
bounding
at
such
a
rate
that
we
shall
have
her
in
a
fever
if
we
don
t
look
out
this
will
never
do
as
to
your
sister
miss
oh
what
about
her
cried
marjorie
she
flung
down
her
hands
and
looked
up
at
the
doctor
with
eyes
full
of
agony
good
gracious
what
a
likeness
between
the
two
said
howard
well
my
dear
i
will
tell
you
the
simple
truth
i
know
you
will
be
a
brave
girl
your
sister
is
in
bad
case
of
typhoid
fever
always
means
that
you
understand
but
i
have
hope
and
so
has
my
friend
ericson
that
we
shall
pull
her
through
there
is
no
cause
for
immediate
anxiety
but
much
depends
on
the
next
hours
ericson
is
going
to
stay
up
with
your
sister
and
as
for
you
miss
marjorie
you
must
go
to
bed
and
have
a
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
howard
said
ericson
that
miss
marjorie
has
been
behaving
in
a
very
natural
but
also
a
very
reprehensible
manner
she
has
insisted
on
living
in
her
sister
s
room
has
done
herself
no
good
oh
well
as
you
say
that
is
natural
said
howard
who
could
read
character
like
a
book
poor
child
she
feels
this
terribly
give
her
a
sleeping
draught
ericson
won
t
you
and
now
my
dear
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
possible
and
leave
your
sister
s
case
in
our
hands
and
he
added
dropping
his
voice
to
a
whisper
in
the
hands
of
a
better
he
left
the
room
when
he
had
done
so
marjorie
burst
into
tears
oh
now
i
can
breathe
now
i
can
sleep
she
said
the
hard
and
terrible
strain
has
left
my
heart
yes
leslie
i
shall
sleep
i
am
dead
chapter
xxvi
annie
s
request
the
next
day
marjorie
awoke
from
her
long
sleep
with
a
stunned
feeling
at
her
heart
but
no
longer
quite
such
a
keen
sense
of
despair
she
clung
to
leslie
and
would
scarcely
let
her
out
of
her
sight
the
doctors
were
rather
anxious
about
her
she
was
scarcely
likely
to
take
the
fever
but
if
she
exhausted
herself
in
the
way
she
was
doing
she
might
be
laid
up
with
a
severe
nervous
attack
accordingly
chetwynd
implored
leslie
to
remain
with
them
and
leslie
having
received
a
note
from
her
mother
to
say
that
she
was
only
too
glad
she
was
making
herself
useful
agreed
to
do
so
on
the
afternoon
of
that
same
day
marjorie
went
to
lie
down
there
was
absolute
stillness
in
the
house
for
lettie
had
gone
out
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
a
friend
the
sick
girl
was
fighting
death
in
the
room
overhead
and
leslie
found
herself
alone
in
the
pretty
boudoir
it
was
a
charming
room
furnished
with
every
taste
and
luxury
but
leslie
as
she
lay
back
in
a
deep
chair
had
a
strange
feeling
of
inertia
and
lassitude
all
over
her
she
was
glad
to
be
with
marjorie
but
the
depression
which
had
so
often
visited
her
of
late
was
on
this
afternoon
worse
than
ever
parker
s
attitude
to
her
yesterday
kept
recurring
again
and
again
to
her
memory
the
cold
almost
disdainful
look
he
had
given
her
the
effort
to
appear
as
usual
before
her
mother
and
brother
and
sisters
the
signal
failure
of
that
effort
kept
coming
back
to
her
he
had
done
much
for
her
she
had
taken
an
enormous
favor
from
his
hands
now
what
a
terrible
position
she
found
herself
in
oh
llewellyn
was
right
after
all
he
would
not
take
a
from
anyone
how
she
wished
she
had
been
equally
determined
in
the
midst
of
these
meditations
she
heard
a
ring
at
the
front
door
the
next
moment
the
footman
came
up
opened
the
door
of
the
boudoir
and
ushered
in
a
visitor
leslie
started
to
her
feet
a
vexed
exclamation
came
to
her
lips
and
with
difficulty
remained
unspoken
for
annie
colchester
stood
before
her
i
followed
you
here
leslie
said
annie
can
i
see
you
at
once
and
by
yourself
certainly
said
leslie
her
tone
was
cold
sit
down
annie
did
not
sit
she
came
quickly
across
the
room
and
looked
full
at
leslie
you
know
of
course
she
said
abruptly
that
i
have
come
down
from
wode
s
yes
and
how
did
you
pass
your
final
i
took
an
more
and
now
i
want
some
work
to
of
how
cold
you
look
leslie
so
different
from
what
you
were
when
first
i
met
you
at
wode
never
mind
about
me
answered
leslie
do
you
want
me
to
help
you
have
you
come
on
that
account
yes
i
have
come
to
you
on
that
account
for
you
can
help
me
i
went
to
your
house
this
morning
and
heard
you
were
out
it
was
of
the
most
vital
importance
that
i
should
see
you
so
i
got
your
address
from
your
mother
she
was
unwilling
to
give
it
to
me
at
first
for
she
said
you
were
staying
in
a
house
of
illness
but
i
begged
so
hard
that
at
last
she
gave
way
and
here
i
well
what
is
it
asked
leslie
her
tone
was
still
and
the
want
of
sympathy
in
her
eyes
caused
annie
s
dark
ones
to
flash
angrily
oh
you
are
one
of
those
dreadfully
puritan
people
she
said
who
always
hate
an
unfortunate
sinner
i
would
not
like
you
to
be
my
judge
at
the
great
you
must
not
talk
to
me
in
that
tone
said
leslie
stung
in
her
turn
you
know
what
you
have
done
you
have
changed
all
my
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
are
still
fretting
over
that
matter
what
can
it
signify
to
you
whether
parker
thinks
badly
of
you
or
not
just
consider
for
a
moment
what
would
have
happened
if
you
had
betrayed
me
that
it
might
have
been
the
better
for
me
and
for
you
too
if
i
had
spoken
the
truth
said
leslie
i
am
sometimes
inclined
to
believe
that
i
did
wrong
to
shield
wrong
to
shield
me
why
i
should
have
been
expelled
ruined
absolutely
ruined
for
but
i
should
not
be
feeling
as
bitter
as
i
now
you
would
have
been
so
miserable
you
would
not
have
cared
to
live
said
annie
with
conviction
but
now
don
t
let
us
hark
back
on
that
affair
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
and
at
once
can
you
possibly
come
out
with
me
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
to
to
parker
and
with
you
no
annie
that
i
can
not
but
you
must
listen
to
me
annie
suddenly
fell
on
her
knees
and
took
one
of
leslie
s
hands
in
hers
how
luxurious
this
room
is
she
said
she
looked
around
it
as
she
spoke
glancing
at
the
curtained
windows
the
pictured
walls
the
comfortable
chair
in
which
leslie
was
seated
your
friends
are
rich
she
continued
and
although
your
home
is
plain
enough
yet
you
have
never
wanted
i
wonder
leslie
if
you
were
ever
hungry
hungry
to
the
point
of
what
do
you
mean
asked
leslie
oh
you
d
know
very
well
if
you
had
suffered
now
i
have
let
me
show
you
the
money
i
have
in
my
she
slipped
her
hand
into
her
pocket
took
out
her
purse
and
tumbled
its
contents
into
leslie
s
lap
i
don
t
want
to
see
said
leslie
but
you
must
look
see
here
is
a
piece
and
here
are
four
shillings
ten
and
four
make
fourteen
that
is
all
i
possess
absolutely
all
and
i
have
not
a
friend
in
the
world
my
your
brother
is
in
australia
never
mind
where
he
is
if
he
keeps
his
promise
to
you
i
must
never
see
him
again
he
must
never
come
back
to
england
but
listen
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
has
to
do
with
me
i
could
scarcely
live
on
less
than
two
shillings
a
day
which
means
that
i
have
exactly
a
week
in
which
to
spend
my
money
at
the
end
of
that
time
where
am
i
she
stood
up
and
held
out
her
empty
palms
now
listen
leslie
i
know
parker
does
not
like
me
and
he
never
liked
rupert
it
is
true
he
was
kind
to
me
for
he
helped
to
pay
for
my
education
at
wode
s
if
i
had
taken
a
at
my
final
i
could
have
got
a
good
situation
as
a
teacher
although
i
hate
teaching
for
i
am
too
impatient
and
too
dreamy
but
as
i
have
only
barely
taken
an
ordinary
all
that
sort
of
thing
is
hopeless
besides
even
if
it
were
not
hopeless
there
is
nothing
vacant
i
must
live
while
i
am
waiting
for
a
situation
now
parker
wants
a
secretary
he
wants
a
girl
to
come
to
his
office
every
day
to
write
his
letters
and
to
attend
generally
to
his
correspondence
and
i
intend
to
secure
that
post
i
am
told
that
he
offers
his
secretary
two
guineas
a
week
i
mean
to
be
that
secretary
i
mean
to
earn
that
money
he
won
t
give
me
the
post
though
because
he
does
not
like
me
well
enough
but
if
you
come
with
me
and
plead
for
me
just
because
he
likes
you
because
he
loves
you
he
will
give
the
post
to
me
can
you
come
now
at
once
i
was
at
his
office
this
morning
i
did
not
say
who
i
was
and
do
you
know
there
were
twenty
girls
waiting
to
see
him
for
this
one
situation
they
all
looked
capable
and
clever
the
sort
who
would
write
his
letters
and
attend
to
his
correspondence
and
keep
things
going
for
him
but
every
one
of
those
twenty
girls
are
to
be
disappointed
for
i
am
to
be
the
successful
one
i
shall
be
if
you
will
speak
a
good
word
for
me
come
leslie
will
you
do
this
for
me
but
do
you
quite
realize
what
you
are
asking
said
leslie
to
demand
a
favor
of
parker
annie
you
can
not
know
what
this
means
i
will
speak
to
you
frankly
my
heart
has
been
cold
as
a
stone
to
you
you
have
made
my
life
all
gall
and
oh
folly
said
annie
remember
i
shall
starve
only
fourteen
shillings
between
me
and
the
world
but
parker
will
not
give
you
the
situation
if
i
ask
him
continued
leslie
he
scarcely
speaks
to
me
now
if
we
meet
how
can
i
ask
him
to
do
me
a
favor
annie
you
expect
too
annie
stared
very
hard
at
leslie
then
she
rose
to
her
feet
there
was
a
look
of
despair
in
her
eyes
her
cheeks
were
ghastly
white
fourteen
shillings
she
said
in
a
whisper
she
returned
her
purse
to
her
pocket
and
looked
again
at
leslie
are
you
sure
you
won
t
yield
she
said
remember
whatever
you
do
must
be
done
he
is
going
to
decide
leslie
struggled
with
herself
just
at
that
moment
the
door
was
quickly
opened
and
marjorie
rushed
in
there
was
a
queer
look
on
marjorie
s
face
traces
of
recent
tears
in
her
eyes
and
a
softness
about
her
mouth
she
went
up
to
leslie
and
kissed
her
she
did
not
see
annie
at
all
eileen
is
better
she
cried
she
has
had
a
long
quiet
sleep
and
the
nurse
says
she
is
certainly
better
the
doctors
have
just
gone
too
and
they
believe
that
she
is
on
the
mend
they
think
that
the
worst
is
over
leslie
god
did
hear
our
prayers
i
shall
believe
in
god
now
as
long
as
ever
i
live
i
wish
belle
acheson
would
come
in
order
that
i
might
tell
her
how
god
heard
our
prayers
yes
i
shall
believe
in
him
as
long
as
i
live
it
was
your
thought
leslie
your
splendid
thought
and
it
has
succeeded
oh
i
am
so
happy
she
kissed
leslie
again
and
ran
out
of
the
room
as
quickly
as
she
had
entered
she
did
not
even
notice
annie
colchester
who
stood
near
the
window
when
marjorie
closed
the
door
behind
her
leslie
looked
full
at
annie
what
can
it
all
mean
said
annie
how
queer
marjorie
chetwynd
looked
no
wonder
said
leslie
her
sister
eileen
was
at
death
s
door
but
she
is
a
little
better
only
marjorie
talked
some
humbug
about
prayer
did
she
imagine
that
prayed
i
thought
you
were
too
no
no
said
leslie
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
and
a
suppressed
sob
i
am
a
miserable
girl
but
does
not
matter
annie
i
will
do
what
you
then
you
are
an
angel
after
all
i
thought
you
one
once
and
so
did
rupert
but
you
yourself
choked
us
off
well
come
with
me
now
you
are
an
angel
after
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
annie
s
lips
her
hand
hot
and
trembling
with
excitement
had
scarcely
touched
leslie
s
sleeve
before
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
belle
acheson
was
announced
belle
came
in
with
a
queer
eager
look
on
her
face
a
kind
of
hungry
look
she
went
straight
up
to
leslie
i
did
not
ask
the
man
at
the
door
she
said
i
didn
t
wish
to
i
felt
i
would
rather
get
the
news
good
or
bad
from
you
do
you
know
what
a
queer
thing
happened
i
was
so
impressed
by
what
you
told
me
yesterday
that
i
actually
i
belle
acheson
began
to
pray
in
real
earnest
all
night
long
i
kept
asking
god
to
spare
eileen
and
now
the
question
is
has
he
done
so
leslie
how
is
eileen
is
she
better
she
is
belle
oh
she
is
cried
leslie
it
is
too
wonderful
but
it
is
true
god
has
heard
all
our
prayers
it
is
only
a
moment
back
that
dear
marjorie
ran
into
the
room
and
told
me
that
eileen
was
thank
you
replied
belle
you
need
not
say
any
she
turned
her
back
on
leslie
and
walked
to
the
window
she
stood
there
behind
the
shelter
of
the
curtains
and
looked
out
no
one
knew
what
she
saw
or
what
she
felt
after
a
time
she
looked
round
then
it
is
all
right
she
said
there
is
a
god
who
answers
prayers
eileen
will
get
well
again
it
is
a
great
thing
for
a
girl
to
discover
the
truth
of
that
it
makes
a
great
difference
in
her
life
it
is
quite
too
interesting
and
wonderful
it
makes
everything
worth
while
somehow
oh
there
i
can
not
speak
about
she
stopped
abruptly
leslie
did
not
reply
but
annie
now
ran
up
to
belle
don
t
you
know
me
she
said
or
are
you
too
absorbed
with
wonderful
discovery
to
notice
that
i
am
one
of
the
wode
s
of
course
i
know
you
you
are
annie
colchester
the
queer
extraordinary
girl
who
was
almost
as
enthusiastic
as
i
am
to
win
distinction
to
solve
problems
to
acquire
the
great
the
glorious
possession
of
i
am
the
same
answered
annie
although
in
some
ways
my
views
have
don
t
tell
me
so
if
you
are
one
of
those
who
put
their
hand
to
the
plough
and
then
look
back
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
by
the
way
you
have
passed
your
exam
before
now
how
have
you
succeeded
i
have
not
succeeded
at
is
i
have
only
just
taken
an
and
you
meant
to
take
a
in
honors
then
you
have
done
i
know
i
have
replied
annie
hanging
her
head
let
me
look
at
you
said
belle
she
went
straight
up
to
her
put
her
hand
under
annie
s
chin
and
lifted
up
the
blushing
face
and
yet
you
have
a
fine
brow
she
said
plenty
of
brains
there
and
your
eyes
are
clear
and
dancing
with
intelligence
stay
though
let
me
feel
your
she
caught
annie
s
wrist
between
her
finger
and
thumb
belle
herself
was
all
eagerness
now
her
attitude
was
that
of
one
who
stood
at
attention
come
she
said
h
m
i
m
not
a
doctor
but
i
don
t
like
that
pulse
one
moment
it
seems
to
be
running
away
the
next
it
stops
it
is
wabbly
quite
uncertain
annie
colchester
do
you
eat
enough
don
t
question
me
answered
annie
belle
s
gray
eyes
traveled
to
leslie
s
face
leslie
s
lips
formed
a
voiceless
belle
understood
her
by
the
way
where
are
you
staying
she
asked
turning
again
to
annie
have
you
any
friends
in
town
i
have
no
special
friends
i
am
in
what
address
i
can
not
give
you
an
address
because
i
am
leaving
then
that
is
delightful
you
shall
come
home
with
with
you
do
you
mean
it
of
course
i
mean
it
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
saying
things
i
don
t
mean
i
should
consider
such
conduct
a
breach
of
truth
do
you
imagine
for
a
moment
that
i
am
a
liar
i
who
wish
to
cultivate
all
the
sacred
virtues
to
stoop
to
a
lie
when
i
ask
you
to
come
home
with
me
i
wish
to
have
you
i
want
a
friend
to
keep
me
company
an
intelligent
friend
you
shall
stay
with
me
for
a
week
at
least
i
don
t
believe
in
that
failure
of
yours
if
you
did
not
take
honors
you
ought
to
have
taken
them
that
brow
and
those
eyes
were
not
given
you
for
nothing
by
the
way
did
i
ever
mention
to
i
don
t
think
i
i
am
starting
a
little
hostel
of
my
own
that
i
am
saving
money
for
it
i
do
not
know
the
exact
sum
that
i
have
saved
but
it
is
not
very
far
from
a
hundred
pounds
you
are
one
of
the
girls
i
should
like
to
live
with
me
there
you
are
just
the
sort
to
fling
aside
every
weight
and
devote
yourself
heart
and
soul
to
the
acquiring
of
glorious
i
have
felt
like
that
now
and
then
said
annie
but
somehow
the
motive
has
gone
it
is
unfair
absolutely
unfair
for
me
to
come
to
you
on
false
oh
whether
you
are
clever
or
not
you
look
as
if
you
wanted
a
week
s
rest
i
am
very
happy
occurred
has
given
can
not
exactly
tell
you
what
but
a
wonderful
feeling
i
am
in
the
humor
to
do
a
good
deed
and
you
are
the
person
who
wants
it
done
to
you
want
rest
and
good
nourishment
and
peace
you
have
been
tossed
about
in
a
sore
battle
i
do
not
know
where
and
i
do
not
know
how
but
the
proof
lies
in
the
queer
desolate
expression
of
your
face
my
home
is
comfortable
and
mother
always
does
exactly
what
i
like
so
come
at
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
and
i
will
come
said
annie
it
is
a
great
boon
to
me
but
i
must
first
go
out
with
leslie
off
with
you
then
at
once
i
don
t
want
to
pry
into
any
secrets
but
leslie
when
you
have
done
with
her
bring
her
or
send
her
back
to
me
you
know
the
old
address
in
maida
vale
for
the
chapter
xxvii
tell
me
the
truth
leslie
this
is
a
wonderful
thing
for
me
said
annie
as
she
stood
up
leslie
turned
and
looked
at
her
without
replying
i
mean
that
my
fourteen
shillings
can
now
last
me
nearly
another
week
by
that
time
if
i
get
this
situation
i
shall
have
saved
money
and
be
quite
independent
leslie
you
can
not
imagine
what
a
load
will
be
lifted
from
my
mind
and
you
will
have
done
it
i
shall
thank
you
to
the
longest
day
i
but
i
don
t
want
to
do
it
said
leslie
you
don
t
know
how
dreadful
i
feel
pray
don
t
say
any
more
to
me
i
am
not
good
now
not
at
all
i
want
to
be
away
by
myself
to
fight
this
thing
out
to
the
bitter
end
but
here
we
are
i
ll
do
my
best
for
you
annie
only
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
thank
the
girls
found
themselves
now
in
queen
victoria
street
they
reached
the
house
where
parker
s
offices
were
went
upstairs
to
the
second
floor
and
presently
entered
a
room
where
several
clerks
were
busy
you
must
take
the
initiative
now
said
annie
touching
leslie
on
the
arm
they
know
me
for
i
have
been
here
often
but
they
do
not
know
you
go
up
to
one
of
the
clerks
and
say
that
you
wish
to
see
again
leslie
found
herself
hesitating
but
then
she
quickly
made
up
her
mind
she
must
go
on
with
what
she
meant
to
do
at
any
cost
she
crossed
the
room
therefore
quickly
and
stood
before
a
desk
where
an
elderly
man
with
gray
hair
was
writing
i
have
come
to
see
parker
said
leslie
is
he
in
mr
parker
is
in
miss
was
the
reply
but
he
is
specially
is
he
likely
to
be
disengaged
soon
asked
leslie
within
half
an
hour
perhaps
he
is
interviewing
some
young
ladies
for

know
said
annie
who
had
followed
leslie
across
the
room

quick

that
very
subject
replied
leslie
what
miss
said
the
clerk

of
the
candidates
no
not
exactly
but
all
the
same
i
have
come
on
that
very
business
if
you
will
give
me
a
sheet
of
paper

will
write

man
handed
her
one
and
she
scribbled
a
few
words
leslie
gilroy
wants
to
see
you
at
once
please
don
t
engage
a
secretary
finally
until
you
have
heard
what

want
to
she
folded
up
the
paper
and
handed
it
to
the
clerk
will
you
take
that
to
parker
now
she
said
he
will
look
at
it
even
while
he
is
talking
with
another
oh
how
good
you
are
whispered
annie
in
her
ear
another
clerk
motioned
to
the
girls
to
seat
themselves
on
a
bench
not
far
from
the
door
the
elderly
clerk
with
the
gray
hair
went
into
a
room
at
the
opposite
side
he
was
absent
for
a
couple
of
minutes
when
he
returned
he
went
straight
up
to
leslie
mr
parker
will
see
you
in
five
minutes
he
said

way

at
the
clerk

in
a
respectful
tone
and
ushered
the
girls
into
a
small
and
comfortably
furnished
apartment
having
supplied
them
with
a
newspaper
each
he
left
them
this
suspense
is
almost
intolerable
said
annie
you
promise
leslie
that
you
will
plead
very
very
i
will
do
my
best
answered
leslie
but
i
know
you
are
hating
it
said
poor
annie
i
see
it
in
your
don
t
talk
to
me
about
that
annie
i
have
made
up
my
mind
but
i
can
not
can
not
talk
it
over
with
just
then
the
door
was
opened
and
parker
himself
came
in
he
glanced
at
annie
in
some
annoyance
and
surprise
and
gave
leslie
that
cold
level
glance
which
had
almost
broken
her
heart
on
the
day
of
the
picnic
i
understand
that
you
want
to
speak
to
me
he
said
leslie
rose
i
do
she
said
can
i
see
you
by
yourself
you
can
if
you
have
come
on
a
very
urgent
matter
but
as
a
rule
i
never
see
anyone
here
except
on
this
is
truly
a
matter
of
has
miss
colchester
anything
to
do
with
it
then
i
had
better
see
you
alone
come
this
he
took
no
further
notice
of
annie
but
ushered
leslie
into
the
next
room
closing
the
door
he
asked
her
to
seat
herself
now
what
is
it
he
said
i
can
scarcely
tell
you
how
painful
it
is
to
me
to
come
to
you
began
leslie
then
why
do
you
do
it
said
parker
because
i
want
to
ask
you
for
a
ah
to
lend
you
another
sixty
pounds
leslie
s
face
turned
very
white
do
you
know
that
you
my
father
s
old
friend
are
cruel
she
said
i
don
t
think
so
on
the
contrary
i
consider
that
i
am
most
forbearing
a
girl
who
can
go
into
debt
once
and
conceal
it
from
her
friends
and
send
another
mr
parker
you
break
my
again
i
repeat
i
am
sorry
but
i
must
have
my
say
i
can
not
grant
your
request
whatever
it
is
except
in
my
own
fashion
now
speak
up
and
be
quick
being
leslie
gilroy
of
course
i
can
not
refuse
you
anything
in
you
are
doing
much
for
me
i
know
it
is
for
my
mother
s
sake
and
my
father
s
that
s
about
and
never
never
more
for
my
sake
my
feelings
have
changed
toward
you
the
more
i
think
over
that
black
business
the
less
i
like
it
i
can
not
pretend
to
be
other
than
i
well
i
have
not
come
here
to
plead
for
myself
replied
leslie
i
want
to
help
annie
colchester
she
is
very
poor
nearly
starving
she
has
heard
that
you
want
a
parker
raised
his
brows
and
an
ominous
exclamation
dropped
from
his
lips
you
must
hear
me
out
continued
leslie
she
knows
also
that
you
do
not
like
her
scoundrel
muttered
the
merchant
between
his
teeth
but
she
is
not
to
be
held
accountable
for
her
brother
s
did
i
ever
say
she
was
no
but
you
act
somehow
as
if
you
did
oh
i
am
not
going
to
be
afraid
of
you
parker
i
will
speak
out
a
brother
may
be
wicked
and
a
sister
good
and
you
think
her
good
and
virtuous
interrupted
the
merchant
leslie
hastily
proceeded
as
if
she
had
not
heard
this
remark
i
want
you
to
make
annie
your
secretary
she
said
she
feels
sure
that
you
would
refuse
her
own
request
and
she
has
asked
me
to
plead
with
you
i
do
plead
most
earnestly
i
plead
because
i
am
my
father
s
daughter
and
because
once
you
were
fond
of
me
and
good
to
me
annie
is
a
very
clever
girl
she
knows
many
foreign
languages
she
has
a
great
deal
of
shrewdness
in
her
character
and
would
do
your
work
admirably
i
want
you
to
let
her
do
and
you
intend
to
be
responsible
for
her
character
her
character
oh
said
leslie
she
trembled
and
colored
parker
fixed
her
with
his
keen
twinkling
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
dragging
the
truth
out
of
her
soul
if
he
knew
even
for
one
moment
how
annie
had
got
that
money
if
he
knew
about
the
forged
letter
would
he
give
her
the
post
and
you
are
personally
very
desirous
about
this
said
parker
i
am
indeed
under
the
circumstances
it
is
bitterly
hard
for
me
to
have
to
plead
with
you
for
my
whole
heart
aches
you
will
believe
it
or
the
cruel
change
in
our
positions
you
to
whom
i
owe
so
much
think
badly
of
me
but
i
have
risen
to
this
great
effort
on
annie
s
behalf
don
t
let
me
have
to
humble
myself
in
would
there
have
been
anything
so
humiliating
in
your
asking
a
favor
of
your
father
s
greatest
friend
said
parker
a
kinder
note
coming
into
his
voice
it
would
not
have
been
humiliating
at
all
but
under
the
changed
circumstances
it
aye
they
have
changed
truly
but
because
of
your
father
and
our
old
friendship
i
will
do
what
you
wish
leslie
gilroy
but
on
a
oh
i
will
promise
anything
i
am
so
grateful
to
stop
a
moment
young
lady
wait
until
you
have
heard
what
my
condition
is
i
will
do
what
you
will
give
your
friend
that
you
will
tell
me
the
truth
with
regard
to
that
sixty
leslie
turned
from
white
to
red
i
she
began
no
young
lady
no
said
parker
i
can
read
character
well
enough
and
you
have
never
told
me
the
truth
with
regard
to
that
money
there
is
something
concealed
at
the
back
of
it
the
more
i
think
the
more
assured
i
am
and
your
face
tells
me
so
plainly
at
the
present
moment
when
i
know
the
simple
truth
leslie
gilroy
i
will
restore
you
into
my
full
favor
again
and
your
friend
shall
be
my
private
then
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
replied
poor
leslie
trembling
from
head
to
foot
i
can
not
tell
you
more
than
you
know
what
i
know
already
is
not
the
truth
go
child
tell
your
friend
that
you
have
failed
and
that
the
fault
is
leslie
walked
across
the
room
parker
preceded
her
and
flung
open
the
door
he
followed
leslie
into
annie
s
presence
he
stood
and
faced
annie
colchester
i
understand
he
said
bringing
out
his
words
coldly
that
you
have
asked
leslie
gilroy
to
come
here
and
plead
for
you
you
want
to
be
my
secretary
i
could
do
the
work
well
said
annie
standing
up
and
speaking
with
glistening
eyes
your
brother
also
assured
me
that
he
could
do
my
work
well
he
had
brains
enough
but
nothing
else
the
scoundrel
annie
bit
her
lips
until
the
blood
nearly
came
she
made
a
valiant
effort
not
to
speak
but
to
hear
rupert
abused
was
like
dragging
her
through
fire
now
listen
to
said
parker
i
have
spoken
to
leslie
gilroy
i
have
told
her
that
i
will
grant
her
request
when
she
tells
me
the
whole
truth
about
that
sixty
pounds
which
you
took
from
me
to
her
it
is
true
i
have
her
letter
but
it
was
not
only
her
letter
it
was
your
pleading
which
induced
me
to
give
it
since
that
hour
i
have
felt
certain
that
something
is
hidden
when
leslie
tells
me
the
exact
truth
you
annie
colchester
shall
have
the
place
you
had
better
go
away
both
of
you
girls
and
is
something
at
the
back
of
this
i
will
keep
the
post
open
for
hours
but
no
longer
now
go
you
have
my
chapter
xxviii
rupert
when
the
girls
found
themselves
once
more
in
the
open
air
neither
of
them
spoke
then
annie
said
in
a
gasping
sort
of
voice
i
see
quite
well
leslie
that
it
is
all
useless
i
give
up
the
hope
which
seemed
so
bright
a
short
time
ago
you
have
done
your
very
best
and
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
i
will
go
to
belle
acheson
now
perhaps
something
will
turn
up
at
the
end
of
a
week
at
any
rate
i
have
that
week
to
turn
round
we
will
go
to
the
bank
said
leslie
omnibuses
go
from
there
in
all
directions
as
to
what
parker
said
you
know
annie
that
it
remains
with
and
do
you
think
said
annie
coloring
and
shivering
that
if
i
could
bring
myself
to
tell
the
real
truth
i
should
get
the
post
i
think
so
for
parker
is
a
man
who
never
goes
back
on
his
word
he
promised
to
give
it
to
you
if
the
truth
were
known
he
made
no
and
will
be
restored
to
his
favor
i
have
nothing
to
say
replied
leslie
somewhat
proudly
i
will
not
plead
for
myself
you
won
t
get
the
post
you
covet
unless
the
truth
is
i
can
not
do
it
said
annie
it
would
be
betraying
not
only
myself
but
rupert
can
you
find
your
way
back
to
the
chetwynds
certainly
i
can
and
that
is
your
omnibus
with
maida
vale
marked
on
leslie
held
up
her
parasol
and
the
driver
stopped
annie
got
in
leslie
nodded
to
her
and
turned
away
annie
shrank
back
in
her
corner
she
shut
her
eyes
her
head
was
aching
violently
her
one
only
desire
that
she
had
at
that
not
to
tell
but
to
hide
the
truth
the
secretaryship
would
have
saved
would
have
enabled
her
to
live
respectably
and
in
comfort
but
it
was
not
to
be
hers
between
it
and
her
lay
a
sin
which
she
committed
for
the
one
she
loved
best
in
the
world
now
she
had
to
think
how
she
was
to
manage
where
could
she
get
work
what
work
could
she
best
undertake
how
long
would
belle
keep
her
as
a
guest
belle
was
known
to
be
erratic
and
uncertain
well
at
least
for
a
week
she
was
safe
during
that
time
she
would
treasure
her
shillings
as
if
they
were
gold
the
drive
was
a
long
one
but
presently
she
reached
her
destination
the
omnibus
drew
up
she
alighted
and
turned
forlornly
into
the
square
where
belle
lived
with
her
mother
belle
s
house
was
no
it
was
at
the
side
of
the
square
annie
had
nearly
reached
it
when
she
felt
a
hand
laid
lightly
on
her
shoulder
she
turned
round
in
an
access
of
terror
then
a
cry
of
mingled
astonishment
fear
and
delight
burst
from
her
and
the
next
instant
she
had
clasped
her
arms
round
her
brother
s
neck
oh
rupert
she
cried
where
did
you
come
from
i
thought
you
were
at
the
other
side
of
the
i
will
tell
you
all
replied
rupert
in
a
cheerful
voice
there
s
no
manner
of
use
in
your
giving
way
and
don
t
for
goodness
sake
hug
me
in
public
annie
of
course
i
m
not
in
never
went
there
i
m
not
such
a
fool
do
you
think
it
s
likely
i
would
leave
this
place
when
i
had
sixty
pounds
in
my
pocket
but
you
owed
that
money
it
was
given
you
to
pay
a
well
i
paid
part
of
all
the
fellows
were
only
too
glad
to
get
twenty
pounds
from
me
so
you
see
my
dear
little
sister
i
had
forty
pounds
left
to
go
on
the
spree
with
but
now
my
creditors
are
clamoring
for
the
second
instalment
annie
my
dear
i
want
your
help
again
and
what
is
more
i
must
have
it
you
little
guessed
when
you
were
shrinking
up
in
that
corner
of
the
omnibus
that
i
was
enjoying
a
cigar
on
the
roof
i
hurried
down
when
you
alighted
and
have
followed
you
that
precious
miss
gilroy
little
knew
how
close
i
was
to
her
vicinity
when
she
bade
you
at
the
oh
rupert
i
am
so
terribly
frightened
and
yet
it
is
a
real
joy
to
see
poor
old
girl
said
rupert
patting
annie
on
her
shoulder
you
always
were
affectionate
you
ve
got
me
out
of
more
than
one
scrape
and
you
ll
get
me
out
of
this
one
won
t
you
kiddy
now
where
can
we
go
for
a
real
good
talk
i
don
t
know
this
part
of
london
replied
annie
well
it
is
like
any
other
part
i
suppose
we
must
talk
in
the
streets
but
it
s
abominably
hard
what
is
your
address
annie
where
are
you
staying
i
am
just
going
to
spend
a
week
with
acheson
she
lives
in
no
in
this
square
it
is
no
newbolt
square
then
here
we
are
i
ll
come
and
see
you
nothing
more
but
rupert
you
must
would
be
most
why
should
it
be
dangerous
why
should
not
a
brother
go
to
see
his
only
sister
you
are
my
sister
and
i
glory
in
the
fact
said
annie
whatever
you
do
i
shall
always
feel
glad
that
i
belong
to
you
you
will
always
be
the
darling
of
my
heart
but
oh
rupert
if
leslie
finds
out
that
you
have
broken
your
word
it
is
in
her
to
be
very
hard
she
is
hard
already
i
never
knew
anyone
so
changed
i
live
in
constant
terror
of
her
do
you
know
what
happened
only
no
annie
and
what
is
more
i
don
t
want
to
know
i
am
too
full
of
my
own
affairs
to
be
bothered
by
your
minor
that
is
so
like
you
rupert
i
am
afraid
you
are
growing
terribly
now
don
t
begin
to
preach
old
girl
there
if
it
will
make
you
any
happier
you
shall
tell
me
your
little
adventure
whatever
it
was
only
be
quick
about
they
walked
round
the
square
many
times
miserable
as
annie
felt
there
was
a
strange
glow
at
her
heart
the
color
had
flamed
into
her
pale
cheeks
and
light
into
her
eyes
she
looked
wonderfully
handsome
and
more
than
one
person
turned
to
gaze
at
her
she
briefly
told
rupert
what
had
occurred
at
parker
s
the
old
wretch
cried
rupert
if
there
is
a
man
in
the
world
whom
i
fairly
loathe
it
is
parker
and
so
he
spoke
of
me
as
a
scoundrel
did
he
perhaps
i
ll
have
my
little
revenge
but
you
would
not
really
do
anything
wrong
rupert
oh
dear
me
no
said
rupert
in
a
sarcastic
voice
all
i
want
at
present
is
twenty
pounds
do
let
us
drop
parker
out
of
this
conversation
if
i
could
bleed
him
to
that
extent
i
would
right
heartily
but
as
i
do
not
see
my
way
to
doing
so
a
second
time
we
must
get
it
in
some
other
fashion
and
that
remains
for
you
to
discover
annie
but
dear
rupert
there
are
no
means
open
to
me
and
i
would
not
if
i
could
help
you
in
that
dreadful
way
but
you
might
think
out
another
dodge
i
laugh
now
when
i
think
of
how
you
managed
a
letter
in
another
girl
s
name
and
taking
it
to
parker
of
all
people
and
parker
giving
the
money
and
blaming
that
miss
gilroy
and
you
and
i
getting
off
it
was
about
the
cheekiest
boldest
cleverest
deed
that
any
girl
ever
did
and
you
did
it
for
your
brother
s
sake
annie
my
dear
you
will
be
as
clever
as
cheeky
as
bold
again
for
your
poor
brother
s
rupert
i
can
not
then
you
know
of
course
what
the
consequence
will
rupert
colchester
now
completely
changed
his
manner
he
had
an
expressive
face
capable
of
almost
any
emotion
he
had
been
sad
he
had
been
jocular
in
annie
s
presence
during
this
short
interview
now
he
looked
as
if
despair
had
seized
him
his
face
changed
color
it
lengthened
and
seemed
to
grow
thinner
and
more
haggard
each
moment
then
i
can
not
help
it
he
said
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
further
to
say
you
did
your
best
and
you
can
do
no
more
i
ll
be
locked
up
i
have
got
into
a
scrape
which
i
can
not
explain
to
you
there
is
a
fellow
to
whom
i
owe
twenty
pounds
and
if
i
don
t
get

to
the
police
court
to
give
evidence
against
your

in
for
such
bad
ways
oh
if
only
mother

alive
look
here
annie
none
of
that
said
colchester
his
voice
becoming
so
stern
that
poor
annie
nearly
shook
there
he
added
instantly
changing
his
tone
when
he
saw
that
she
shivered
and
shrank
from
him
i
know
you
will
help
me
if
you
can
you
ll
just
think
it
over
and
let
me
know
when
next
we
meet
where
did
you
say
you
were
going
to
no
who
lives
at
no
newbolt
square
people
of
the
name
of

i
don
t
know
they

in
a
respectable
house
and

be
well
off
said
rupert
i
tell
you
what
you
ll
do
annie
you
get
acheson
to
lend
you
twenty
pounds
now
see
you
do
it
and
be
quick
about
it
she
ll
lend
it
fast
enough
if
you
pull
a
long
face
and
make
up
a
pitiable
story
and
i
ll
meet
you
somehow
or
other
oh
yes
i
ll
manage
i
need
not
enter
into
particulars
just
now
you
will
tell
me
what
you
can
do
when
we
meet
that
is
all
i
require
for
the
present
if
you
get
me
that
twenty
pounds
i
ll
let
you
promise
i
a
month
or
but
rupert
i
don
t
know
anything
whatever
about
acheson
i
have
never
even
seen
her
belle
her
daughter
is
a
very
odd
clever
creature
but
i
am
quite
certain
the
achesons
are
not
is
this
belle
one
of
the
wode
s
undergraduates
then
of
course
they
must
be
rich
or
she
could
not
go
to
a
place
like
wingfield
and
that
reminds
me
annie
what
a
goose
you
were
not
to
take
honors
in
your
exam
you
barely
more
if
you
had
taken
a
first
i
know
a
fellow
who
would
have
lent
me
twenty
pounds
on
the
strength
of
your
getting
a
good
post
but
now
all
that
is
knocked
on
the
head
and
by
your
laziness
positively
it
s
enough
to
sicken
a
fellow
well
annie
you
know
what
you
have
before
you
you
must
get
twenty
pounds
for
your
brother
within
the
next
two
or
three
days
or
there
is
a
prison
ahead
of
oh
rupert
rupert
you
do
make
me
so
perfectly
wretched
said
poor
annie
i
must
frankly
confess
that
i
have
no
hope
at
all
of
being
able
to
help
where
there
s
a
will
there
s
a
way
said
rupert
whistling
gaily
now
i
m
not
going
to
bother
you
any
more
my
words
will
sink
deep
i
know
my
pretty
little
annie
think
of
the
old
times
do
you
remember
that
spring
when
we
went
out
together
and
picked
primroses
and
that
time
when
you
had
the
measles
and
i
was
so
awfully
good
to
you
don
t
you
remember
when
you
were
so
tired
of
being
left
by
yourself
i
used
to
come
in
and
risk
taking
the
beastly
thing
a
second
time
to
amuse
you
oh
you
ll
help
me
you
won
t
leave
your
brother
rupert
in
a
lurch
well
go
off
now
to
your
precious
achesons
and
your
comfortable
home
think
when
you
are
lapped
in
luxury
of
your
poor
starving
oh
rupert
you
surely
are
not
starving
well
i
have
not
had
a
decent
meal
for
a
week
last
time
i
ate
was
yesterday
evening
so
you
can
imagine
i
m
pretty
peckish
by
the
way
you
don
t
happen
to
have
a
sovereign
about
you
no
indeed
i
don
t
possess
so
much
in
the
world
i
ve
only
got
fourteen
shillings
not
a
penny
rupert
gave
vent
to
a
prolonged
whistle
are
things
really
as
bad
as
that
he
cried
well
at
any
rate
you
won
t
want
money
while
you
are
at
the
achesons
you
might
let
me
have
those
few
shillings
you
can
have
them
back
when
you
want
but
rupert
they
are
all
i
possess
all
i
have
between
me
and
the
bother
the
workhouse
much
chance
a
pretty
girl
like
you
has
of
going
there
let
me
have
ten
shillings
at
least
you
surely
do
not
mean
to
refuse
your
starving
brother
of
course
i
can
not
refuse
you
said
annie
she
took
up
her
purse
opened
it
and
gave
rupert
half
a
sovereign
he
replied
this
will
do
until
we
meet
you
do
look
a
bit
dragged
annie
now
i
come
to
examine
you
carefully
but
better
days
will
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
down
the
street
poor
as
he
professed
himself
to
be
he
was
by
no
means
shabbily
dressed
he
had
a
fine
figure
square
shoulders
and
a
swagger
in
his
walk
annie
gazed
long
after
his
retreating
form
why
is
he
about
the
most
wicked
person
in
the
world
and
why
do
i
love
him
so
much
she
thought
there
i
have
only
four
shillings
now
how
i
am
to
get
that
twenty
pounds
heaven
only
knows
oh
i
am
a
miserable
most
miserable
girl
chapter
xxix
newbolt
square
acheson
although
a
most
woman
and
affectionate
mother
would
if
she
had
spoken
her
innermost
thoughts
have
confessed
that
belle
was
not
at
all
to
her
mind
being
her
daughter
she
thought
it
her
duty
to
be
as
good
as
she
could
possibly
be
to
belle
but
she
would
infinitely
have
preferred
a
girl
in
the
style
of
lettie
chetwynd
a
sociable
agreeable
pleasant
girl
who
would
have
done
credit
to
pretty
dresses
have
won
a
desirable
lover
and
married
comfortably
she
would
indeed
have
considered
her
cup
of
happiness
complete
had
such
a
girl
as
leslie
gilroy
been
hers
but
belle
being
the
child
allotted
to
her
by
providence
she
was
wise
enough
to
make
the
best
of
her
not
to
attempt
to
turn
her
into
any
other
groove
and
to
endeavor
to
counteract
her
eccentricities
as
far
as
possible
when
belle
mentioned
to
her
mother
that
she
had
invited
a
wode
s
girl
to
stay
with
her
acheson
was
pleased
she
went
happily
upstairs
to
see
that
annie
s
room
was
neat
and
comfortable
the
bed
well
aired
and
all
the
necessary
accessories
of
a
bedroom
as
they
ought
to
be
when
her
young
guest
arrived
she
hurried
downstairs
to
welcome
her
and
seeing
that
the
girl
looked
forlorn
and
tired
with
a
droop
about
her
lips
and
an
expression
in
her
eyes
which
quite
went
to
the
good
woman
s
heart
she
kissed
her
affectionately
bade
her
welcome
and
took
her
into
the
drawing
room
you
don
t
look
well
dear
she
said
i
am
very
pleased
that
belle
has
asked
you
to
stay
with
us
may
i
ask
if
you
and
my
daughter
are
great
friends
no
replied
annie
in
fact
we
scarcely
know
each
other
we
did
not
live
in
the
same
house
at
wode
s
but
we
have
met
often
i
happened
to
be
at
the
chetwynds
this
morning
where
leslie
gilroy
was
staying
when
miss
acheson
arrived
and
most
kindly
invited
me
here
for
a
week
i
was
only
too
glad
to
accept
the
invitation
continued
annie
raising
her
pathetic
eyes
to
acheson
s
face
for
i
have
no
home
at
dear
dear
my
poor
child
that
is
truly
sad
said
the
good
lady
but
you
must
tell
me
all
your
story
later
on
i
am
deeply
interested
in
young
girls
and
any
friend
of
my
belle
s
has
my
kindest
sympathy
now
let
me
take
you
to
your
acheson
took
annie
upstairs
she
saw
that
the
girl
had
hot
water
said
that
belle
would
be
glad
to
lend
her
anything
until
her
own
trunk
arrived
and
left
her
but
i
don
t
like
the
look
on
her
face
all
the
same
thought
the
good
woman
as
she
trotted
downstairs
belle
was
standing
in
the
hall
my
dear
said
acheson
eagerly
miss
colchester
has
belle
did
not
immediately
reply
she
was
hanging
her
jacket
on
the
she
seldom
troubled
to
take
it
upstairs
yes
mother
she
answered
putting
her
hand
to
her
forehead
and
arranging
her
short
locks
into
position
but
what
about
it
i
thought
naturally
she
would
she
does
not
look
very
well
belle
she
seems
so
tired
scarcely
like
to
say
the
oh
i
dare
say
she
is
replied
belle
in
a
careless
tone
she
was
always
a
good
bit
of
an
oddity
and
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
doubtless
neglected
her
food
but
as
to
her
being
ill
i
think
she
is
all
right
she
has
worked
rather
hard
that
is
then
we
will
give
her
a
right
good
time
won
t
we
dear
said
acheson
belle
stared
at
her
mother
through
her
glasses
and
again
did
not
reply
she
went
into
the
drawing
room
in
her
dusty
boots
as
we
have
a
guest
belle
dear
what
in
the
world
is
it
mother
what
are
you
fidgeting
so
dreadfully
about
nothing
my
love
only
would
you
greatly
mind
going
upstairs
to
wash
your
hands
tidy
your
hair
and
take
off
your
dusty
boots
before
dinner
oh
dear
replied
belle
in
an
impatient
voice
if
i
had
thought
annie
colchester
s
being
here
would
mean
all
this
sort
of
thing
i
would
have
thought
twice
before
i
invited
it
was
now
acheson
s
turn
to
make
no
reply
she
knew
belle
quite
well
enough
to
be
certain
that
it
was
worse
than
useless
to
argue
with
her
if
she
left
that
eccentric
young
person
to
herself
things
as
a
rule
turned
out
according
to
acheson
s
wish
belle
hummed
and
hawed
and
looked
very
cross
but
finally
did
leave
the
room
when
dinner
was
announced
the
two
girls
entered
the
together
annie
was
only
able
to
make
a
very
scanty
and
imperfect
toilet
for
her
clothes
which
she
had
telegraphed
to
her
late
landlady
to
forward
had
not
yet
arrived
they
went
down
to
dinner
the
meal
was
a
good
one
and
nicely
served
annie
ate
heartily
and
felt
considerably
refreshed
afterwards
she
was
tired
too
there
was
a
sort
of
stunned
feeling
over
her
if
acheson
only
knew
the
truth
if
she
could
guess
even
for
a
single
moment
that
between
annie
and
starvation
were
only
four
shillings
would
she
not
immediately
think
that
she
annie
had
come
into
her
house
on
false
pretenses
people
as
a
rule
do
not
ask
starving
girls
to
partake
of
the
comforts
of
their
luxurious
homes
there
is
the
workhouse
for
such
as
them
annie
shivered
the
idea
of
confiding
in
acheson
never
occurred
to
her
meanwhile
that
good
and
excellent
woman
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
forlorn
girl
she
determined
to
give
her
a
right
good
time
and
to
get
at
that
secret
which
knitted
her
dark
brows
and
made
her
beautiful
eyes
so
full
of
indescribable
melancholy
annie
could
not
help
cheering
up
after
a
little
in
the
sunshine
of
this
rare
kindness
the
little
week
which
lay
before
her
was
an
oasis
in
the
desert
she
would
enjoy
it
while
she
could
she
might
gather
some
strength
during
these
few
days
for
the
solitary
and
miserable
time
which
lay
before
her
but
after
all
her
poverty
was
scarcely
her
worst
trouble
now
it
was
the
thought
of
rupert
the
terrible
and
awful
thought
that
he
had
once
more
been
guilty
that
he
had
broken
his
solemn
word
that
the
police
even
now
were
at
his
heels
what
is
to
be
done
thought
the
wretched
girl
how
am
i
to
help
him
presently
acheson
suggested
that
they
should
go
to
bed
you
can
scarcely
keep
your
eyes
open
she
said
looking
at
annie
do
go
up
to
your
room
at
once
dear
and
have
a
long
good
not
quite
yet
mother
said
belle
looking
up
from
her
book
i
want
annie
colchester
to
help
me
with
this
translation
i
know
she
has
gone
right
through
the
sixth
book
of
herodotus
and
i
have
not
i
want
her
to
help
me
with
the
translation
of
the
story
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
what
does
hippocleides
care
acheson
sighed
and
made
no
answer
a
moment
later
she
left
the
room
you
are
not
dead
tired
you
are
willing
to
help
me
said
belle
looking
at
annie
when
they
found
themselves
alone
i
will
help
you
of
course
belle
if
i
can
i
have
read
herodotus
and
thought
it
splendid
but
i
do
not
know
the
story
to
which
you
well
you
can
help
me
anyhow
dear
dear
it
does
seem
a
pity
that
mother
should
have
taken
to
you
in
this
extraordinary
manner
i
know
mother
s
ways
so
well
she
will
begin
to
fuss
over
you
and
then
you
will
imagine
all
sorts
of
things
but
now
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
won
t
consider
yourself
an
martyr
simply
because
mother
has
taken
a
fancy
to
oh
i
have
never
thought
myself
a
martyr
said
annie
then
for
goodness
sake
don
t
wear
that
pensive
air
i
wish
too
you
would
not
open
your
eyes
so
wide
it
gives
you
a
sort
of
starved
starved
really
mean
miss
you
can
call
me
belle
while
you
are
here
it
is
shorter
and
more
convenient
i
could
not
possibly
miss
colchester
you
the
name
is
a
great
deal
too
long
for
everyday
use
you
shall
be
anne
or
ann
while
you
are
here
and
now
pray
ann
take
this
chair
and
let
us
get
through
our
they
did
so
annie
soon
became
interested
she
had
considerable
intellectual
power
and
between
them
the
girls
worked
out
the
problem
with
regard
to
hippocleides
belle
the
first
to
recognize
genius
when
she
saw
it
clapped
her
hands
with
pleasure
this
is
quite
splendid
she
said
i
never
could
get
at
the
bottom
of
that
stiff
rendering
before
i
am
delighted
you
are
here
we
can
become
the
very
closest
friends
some
day
annie
you
shall
come
and
live
with
me
in
my
hostel
mother
does
not
yet
know
of
my
darling
scheme
poor
mother
herself
must
be
excluded
and
she
will
feel
it
poor
thing
but
i
shall
have
quite
money
enough
of
my
own
to
pay
the
rent
of
the
house
for
a
couple
of
years
after
i
leave
college
let
me
see
if
you
don
t
mind
i
ll
get
the
now
and
count
my
savings
i
declare
i
am
getting
quite
miserly
over
this
belle
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
drawing
room
and
from
a
desk
where
her
own
special
treasures
were
kept
took
a
square
deal
box
from
her
pocket
she
extracted
a
little
key
fitted
it
into
the
box
and
opened
it
is
it
safe
to
leave
so
much
money
about
in
that
careless
way
said
annie
who
thought
of
her
own
four
shillings
and
quite
shivered
as
belle
lifted
out
three
canvas
bags
safe
of
course
it
s
safe
answered
belle
do
you
think
our
servants
would
touch
my
money
besides
they
do
not
know
it
is
here
even
mother
does
not
know
what
this
box
contains
she
likes
to
dust
the
drawing
room
herself
and
a
few
days
ago
she
lifted
the
box
and
said
whatever
is
in
here
belle
it
is
so
heavy
i
made
no
reply
and
she
said
i
suppose
love
you
are
collecting
i
said
yes
mother
i
am
collecting
it
was
perfectly
true
wasn
t
it
clever
of
very
clever
answered
annie
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
well
now
let
us
count
you
shall
help
me
by
and
by
with
my
dear
hostel
how
happy
we
shall
be
the
world
quite
out
of
sight
we
delving
in
the
riches
of
the
past
oh
happy
happy
maidens
we
will
eschew
marriage
we
will
be
nuns
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
how
silent
you
are
are
you
not
glad
i
can
not
quite
realize
it
said
annie
you
will
when
you
come
to
live
with
me
we
won
t
need
much
furniture
will
we
dear
just
the
plainest
rooms
any
spare
cash
we
have
will
go
for
editions
original
manuscripts
oh
lovely
lovely
bewitching
intoxicating
i
see
myself
as
i
shall
be
during
all
the
coming
years
on
to
the
decline
of
life
absorbing
more
and
more
knowledge
living
above
the
world
in
it
but
not
of
but
you
won
t
be
in
it
when
you
are
in
your
hostel
said
annie
with
a
gleam
of
humor
in
her
sad
eyes
you
will
be
apart
from
it
and
that
is
not
according
to
leslie
gilroy
s
dear
pretty
leslie
said
belle
with
sudden
enthusiasm
but
the
cares
of
the
world
have
her
in
their
grip
i
admire
her
more
than
any
worldly
girl
i
have
ever
come
across
but
the
world
has
her
in
its
grip
some
day
she
will
see
her
folly
i
hope
to
convert
her
to
my
views
in
the
long
that
you
never
will
said
annie
think
so
well
i
don
t
agree
with
you
now
let
us
the
canvas
bags
were
opened
and
they
did
count
or
rather
belle
did
the
money
in
the
bags
amounted
to
nearly
ninety
pounds
how
glad
i
am
i
did
not
buy
that
new
summer
dress
said
belle
my
old
serge
does
she
held
out
the
dusty
fusty
garment
as
she
spoke
that
economy
added
three
pounds
ten
shillings
to
my
hoard
see
i
will
write
down
the
exact
she
took
a
sheet
of
paper
scribbled
the
sum
in
rough
writing
and
thrust
it
into
the
box
pounds
seven
shillings
and
tenpence
she
said
even
the
pence
are
not
to
be
despised
i
shall
be
at
wode
s
until
next
june
during
that
time
i
hope
to
save
by
the
strictest
economy
quite
fifty
pounds
more
we
can
then
start
our
hostel
almost
but
what
about
food
and
furniture
and
all
the
rest
of
the
things
well
each
girl
of
course
must
bring
her
own
share
wherever
we
are
we
must
must
we
said
annie
in
a
very
pathetic
voice
why
of
course
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
each
human
being
should
have
his
or
her
modicum
of
food
now
don
t
let
us
talk
of
anything
so
very
elemental
let
us
consider
the
charming
picture
which
lies
before
us
a
charming
little
cottage
in
the
shall
get
it
for
twenty
pounds
a
year
the
rest
of
the
money
will
buy
the
furniture
there
annie
you
need
not
stay
up
any
longer
you
look
as
if
you
wished
to
sleep
do
like
an
ordinary
mortal
for
if
you
don
t
mother
will
begin
to
take
to
you
more
than
ever
and
that
will
not
suit
my
plans
at
annie
went
to
her
room
she
was
so
weary
that
she
could
not
even
think
any
longer
the
box
which
held
her
few
possessions
had
arrived
she
took
out
her
nightdress
and
soon
afterward
got
into
bed
she
slept
heavily
all
night
but
toward
morning
she
began
to
have
confused
and
troubled
dreams
with
regard
to
belle
s
wooden
box
she
wished
she
had
not
been
with
belle
when
she
counted
her
money
the
thought
of
that
money
became
an
oppression
and
a
dreadful
nightmare
to
her
at
seven
o
clock
the
servant
appeared
with
a
daintily
prepared
tray
containing
tea
mrs
acheson
hopes
you
are
quite
rested
miss
she
says
if
you
are
at
all
tired
she
would
like
you
to
stay
in
bed
for
oh
no
i
am
quite
refreshed
tell
her
i
thank
her
very
much
said
poor
annie
the
girl
bustled
about
the
room
preparing
annie
s
bath
she
then
left
her
to
enjoy
her
tea
annie
sat
up
and
stirred
the
cream
into
the
fragrant
cup
how
queer
and
dreamlike
and
wonderful
all
this
is
she
said
to
herself
i
enjoying
tea
at
this
hour
in
bed
and
drinking
it
out
of
such
delicate
china
and
oh
what
a
sweet
little
silver
spoon
how
pretty
the
room
is
and
everything
belonging
to
it
and
yet
i
possess
only
four
shillings
in
the
world
acheson
is
quite
the
sweetest
woman
i
ever
met
oh
if
my
own
mother
had
only
lived
i
should
not
be
the
miserable
hopeless
creature
i
am
at
breakfast
belle
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
she
also
had
dreamed
about
her
hostel
and
the
thought
of
the
money
she
had
saved
was
reflected
in
her
face
after
breakfast
she
proposed
to
annie
that
they
should
spend
the
morning
at
the
british
museum
i
can
easily
get
you
a
day
s
ticket
for
the
reading
room
she
said
you
shall
sit
near
me
and
we
can
have
a
good
but
perhaps
annie
would
rather
not
go
to
the
museum
said
acheson
she
looks
very
tired
as
if
she
had
been
overdoing
i
assure
you
mother
said
belle
that
most
of
the
wode
s
students
have
that
sort
of
look
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
it
the
rosy
cheek
the
bright
eye
which
sparkles
with
no
soul
beneath
the
pouting
lips
full
of
rude
health
do
not
belong
to
the
earnest
student
don
t
be
alarmed
about
either
of
us
pray
we
like
our
life
and
we
mean
to
cling
to
oh
i
am
not
at
all
anxious
about
you
dear
said
acheson
you
are
always
somewhat
sallow
but
you
look
well
now
this
poor
very
thin
she
is
belle
prepared
to
leave
the
room
you
will
excuse
me
she
said
turning
to
annie
i
have
to
get
back
to
my
work
do
you
mean
to
come
with
me
or
not
i
should
like
to
come
said
annie
well
that
is
all
right
said
belle
slightly
mollified
you
meet
me
in
the
hall
in
she
dashed
away
and
acheson
began
to
ask
annie
some
impossible
questions
with
regard
to
her
health
if
i
could
but
tell
her
the
truth
thought
the
poor
girl
if
i
could
say
will
you
tell
me
how
long
four
means
keep
any
girl
in
food
and
raiment
i
should
be
greatly
obliged
to
you
if
you
can
solve
that
problem
you
would
indeed
be
my
greatest
friend
on
but
no
no
thought
annie
i
can
not
confide
in
her
that
would
be
quite
the
worst
of
presently
belle
appeared
and
the
girls
set
off
for
the
museum
on
their
way
home
belle
went
for
a
moment
into
a
stationer
s
you
need
not
come
in
she
said
to
annie
just
walk
slowly
on
and
i
ll
soon
overtake
annie
had
not
gone
a
dozen
yards
before
rupert
came
up
to
her
i
just
thought
i
would
meet
you
on
the
road
home
he
said
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
shall
call
on
you
at
acheson
s
this
oh
rupert
surely
you
wouldn
t
dare
dare
said
rupert
why
shouldn
t
i
dare
you
are
to
introduce
me
to
the
achesons
as
your
brother
as
to
that
girl
you
are
staying
with
anyone
can
take
her
in
i
shall
be
at
newbolt
square
between
eight
and
nine
look
out
for
me
and
don
t
he
nodded
and
walked
away
the
next
instant
belle
came
up
i
saw
you
talking
to
a
man
said
belle
who
was
he
do
you
know
many
men
are
you
deceiving
me
annie
colchester
deceiving
you
what
do
you
mean
said
annie
if
you
contemplate
marriage
you
had
better
tell
me
so
at
notwithstanding
all
her
misery
annie
could
not
help
laughing
the
man
i
was
speaking
to
is
my
brother
she
said
your
brother
i
thought
you
were
an
orphan
and
i
have
one
brother
his
name
is
and
that
was
he
why
in
the
world
didn
t
you
ask
him
to
come
home
with
us
i
am
sure
mother
would
be
delighted
to
see
he
is
coming
to
see
me
this
evening
said
annie
her
heart
in
her
mouth
do
you
suppose
that
your
mother
will
think
that
it
think
what
that
he
is
taking
a
liberty
of
course
not
it
is
quite
natural
that
a
sister
should
like
to
talk
to
a
brother
and
mother
will
be
full
of
sympathy
yes
he
is
welcome
provided
he
does
not
come
more
than
once
give
him
to
understand
please
annie
that
we
have
no
time
to
waste
in
idle
conversation
with
him
yes
i
will
say
it
frankly
if
there
is
a
creature
in
the
wide
world
i
thoroughly
despise
it
is
man
in
his
first
at
lunch
belle
mentioned
to
her
mother
that
annie
colchester
had
a
brother
and
that
he
proposed
to
call
that
evening
i
shall
give
him
a
hearty
welcome
for
your
sake
my
dear
said
acheson
what
a
pity
i
did
not
know
and
i
would
have
asked
him
to
share
our
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
see
him
at
all
said
annie
who
felt
more
wretched
each
moment
if
acheson
really
knew
the
sort
of
man
she
was
receiving
into
her
house
would
she
ever
forgive
annie
chapter
xxx
annie
in
the
toils
at
seven
the
achesons
dined
soon
after
eight
o
clock
there
came
a
ring
to
the
front
door
and
rupert
colchester
was
announced
he
came
in
looking
brisk
smart
and
handsome
he
had
managed
annie
could
not
imagine
how
to
get
himself
up
well
he
wore
a
of
the
newest
cut
his
tie
was
immaculate
so
were
his
collar
and
cuffs
he
had
a
hemstitched
handkerchief
in
his
pocket
with
a
slight
scent
about
it
his
hair
had
been
cut
his
face
was
he
was
so
that
poor
foolish
annie
felt
a
glow
at
her
heart
when
she
saw
him
enter
the
room
acheson
was
kind
to
annie
s
brother
and
annie
s
brother
managed
to
make
himself
extremely
agreeable
he
talked
to
acheson
but
he
looked
at
belle
now
belle
although
she
declared
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
she
despised
like
a
man
in
his
first
adolescence
was
disturbed
by
these
glances
from
rupert
s
dark
eyes
she
pretended
not
to
remark
them
nevertheless
she
found
her
own
orbs
meeting
his
again
and
again
after
the
fourth
or
fifth
meeting
of
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
rupert
got
up
left
his
seat
by
acheson
and
came
over
to
where
belle
sat
do
you
know
he
said
dropping
into
a
chair
by
her
side
that
you
interest
me
immensely
indeed
answered
belle
i
am
rather
surprised
to
hear
you
say
so
i
never
yet
knew
the
man
who
wanted
to
look
at
me
a
second
time
i
know
i
am
extremely
plain
and
the
fact
is
i
glory
in
being
it
is
my
turn
now
to
be
surprised
said
rupert
very
gently
good
looks
are
a
great
gift
you
are
quite
mistaken
in
considering
yourself
plain
however
it
is
not
your
coloring
nor
the
size
of
your
mouth
nor
the
shape
of
your
face
which
specially
strikes
me
it
is
the
remarkable
development
of
your
forehead
i
spent
several
of
my
early
years
in
america
and
i
remember
when
there
meeting
a
man
with
a
forehead
like
yours
he
was
the
greatest
classical
scholar
at
harvard
college
near
belle
could
not
help
blushing
with
intense
gratification
ah
she
said
i
also
have
the
same
tastes
i
passionately
love
the
rupert
dropped
his
voice
he
began
to
talk
to
belle
at
once
about
cicero
socrates
homer
and
her
other
favorite
writers
of
antiquity
soon
they
were
in
the
full
flow
of
a
most
animated
conversation
belle
spoke
eagerly
and
well
she
unfolded
the
riches
of
her
really
great
knowledge
and
rupert
cleverly
led
her
on
he
had
a
smattering
of
greek
and
latin
at
his
fingers
ends
but
no
more
he
managed
however
to
use
his
very
little
knowledge
to
the
best
advantage
and
belle
was
so
flattered
by
his
covert
glances
by
his
skillfully
veiled
compliments
by
his
pretended
comprehension
of
her
and
her
moods
that
she
never
guessed
how
shallow
were
his
acquirements
and
opened
out
herself
more
and
more
if
annie
was
nice
her
brother
was
even
nicer
he
was
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
after
all
there
always
was
an
always
a
faint
color
came
into
her
thin
cheeks
coffee
was
brought
in
very
fragrant
strong
coffee
a
servant
approached
belle
with
a
tray
but
she
waved
it
aside
not
now
she
said
then
she
turned
to
rupert
why
will
mother
always
insist
upon
spoiling
a
great
intellectual
treat
with
those
tiresome
attentions
to
creature
comforts
who
wants
coffee
at
a
moment
like
this
now
rupert
who
had
not
been
able
to
indulge
in
a
good
dinner
would
have
liked
a
cup
of
fragrant
coffee
immensely
but
he
instantly
took
his
cue
from
belle
and
declined
it
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
none
for
me
he
said
yes
miss
acheson
i
agree
with
you
at
a
moment
like
the
present
one
can
not
think
of
sublunary
do
go
on
said
belle
so
you
really
and
then
once
more
the
conversation
assumed
its
classical
complexion
annie
looking
on
from
afar
felt
more
and
more
dreadful
each
moment
rupert
was
undoubtedly
trying
to
be
agreeable
to
belle
for
a
purpose
annie
knew
her
brother
quite
sufficiently
well
to
be
certain
that
belle
s
manners
her
attachment
to
the
classics
her
whole
style
would
be
the
very
last
that
rupert
in
easier
moments
of
his
career
would
have
deigned
to
notice
at
last
soon
after
ten
o
clock
he
took
his
leave
in
the
meantime
he
had
learned
not
only
all
that
belle
could
tell
him
of
her
own
college
life
but
also
the
darling
hope
of
the
future
the
little
wooden
box
which
contained
the
pounds
odd
was
pointed
out
to
rupert
he
nodded
to
annie
as
he
left
the
room
she
followed
him
into
the
hall
well
how
did
i
get
on
he
inquired
i
don
t
understand
you
answered
annie
you
frighten
me
what
a
little
goose
you
are
well
i
m
coming
again
i
shall
come
or
next
day
be
sure
you
follow
up
the
impression
i
have
made
with
the
fair
then
he
made
a
grimace
kissed
annie
lightly
on
her
forehead
and
left
the
house
she
went
to
bed
feeling
intensely
uncomfortable
by
the
first
post
in
the
morning
she
received
a
letter
it
was
from
rupert
and
ran
as
follows
my
dear
annie
for
the
desperate
only
desperate
devices
i
am
desperate
i
have
made
up
my
mind
the
fair
and
delightful
miss
belle
shall
be
my
deliverer
i
want
you
and
she
to
meet
me
in
the
broad
walk
in
regent
s
park
between
four
and
five
this
afternoon
i
mean
boldly
to
secure
forty
pounds
out
of
her
wooden
box
she
herself
shall
give
it
to
me
while
i
am
talking
to
her
you
must
be
engaged
in
another
way
excellent
get
the
good
mamma
to
come
too
you
and
the
mamma
can
walk
behind
the
fascinating
belle
and
i
in
front
i
foretell
that
i
can
twist
my
fair
belle
round
my
little
finger
help
me
now
annie
as
you
value
your
brother
s
future
you
perceive
how
nobly
i
take
the
matter
out
of
your
hands
miss
belle
acheson
has
her
sphere
in
life
but
it
is
not
what
she
thinks
it
is
not
to
open
a
hostel
for
idiotic
women
who
think
themselves
learned
but
to
help
rupert
colchester
in
his
hour
of
need
your
affectionate
annie
read
this
letter
twice
at
each
perusal
her
sense
of
dismay
grew
greater
the
worst
of
it
was
too
that
rupert
had
given
no
address
she
could
not
write
in
reply
or
send
him
a
telegram
or
do
anything
to
stop
him
he
would
walk
in
the
broad
walk
in
regent
s
park
that
afternoon
and
if
annie
and
belle
did
not
appear
would
go
boldly
to
the
house
in
newbolt
square
annie
felt
that
she
herself
was
a
guest
in
that
house
more
or
less
on
false
pretenses
but
that
rupert
should
take
advantage
of
acheson
s
hospitality
was
more
than
the
poor
girl
could
stand
i
must
have
it
out
with
him
she
said
to
herself
but
belle
shall
not
come
with
me
i
must
go
and
brave
him
alone
oh
i
know
what
he
will
say
and
what
torture
i
shall
have
to
endure
for
great
sins
as
he
has
committed
i
still
love
him
no
i
will
be
brave
now
i
won
t
sin
again
for
him
but
god
help
me
i
do
not
know
how
to
bear
all
this
awful
the
poor
girl
looked
so
miserable
at
breakfast
that
acheson
remarked
it
my
dear
child
she
said
do
you
know
that
your
appearance
quite
concerns
me
i
am
certain
you
are
not
well
i
am
also
sure
that
you
are
troubled
about
something
have
you
no
relations
dear
except
that
extremely
brother
of
yours
i
have
no
relations
at
all
replied
annie
except
rupert
my
father
and
mother
lived
in
america
where
they
died
i
was
quite
a
child
when
i
came
to
england
since
then
rupert
and
i
have
been
practically
alone
we
were
brought
up
during
the
early
years
of
our
life
by
a
guardian
who
has
since
well
at
any
rate
i
congratulate
you
on
your
brother
annie
said
belle
from
the
far
end
of
the
room
where
she
was
reading
socrates
he
has
what
i
call
a
pure
taste
for
the
classics
i
shall
be
very
pleased
indeed
to
see
him
here
again
mother
don
t
you
agree
with
me
that
rupert
colchester
is
a
scholarly
and
gentlemanly
man
yes
dear
belle
i
do
said
acheson
now
i
tell
you
what
it
is
she
said
turning
in
a
confidential
way
to
annie
you
and
your
brother
shall
see
as
much
of
each
other
as
possible
while
you
are
with
me
if
you
will
just
give
me
his
address
i
will
send
him
a
line
asking
him
to
dine
with
us
this
evening
he
feels
leaving
you
so
leaving
me
said
annie
did
he
say
anything
about
that
yes
my
dear
when
he
goes
to
india
he
says
you
will
feel
the
parting
terribly
he
has
secured
an
excellent
post
in
the
civil
service
and
has
to
start
in
about
a
fortnight
why
what
is
the
matter
dear
annie
for
annie
s
eyes
had
dropped
on
to
her
plate
and
her
face
looked
like
death
i
did
not
know
that
rupert
was
going
to
india
she
said
at
last
raising
them
desperately
and
fixing
them
on
acheson
perhaps
he
did
not
like
to
tell
you
my
love
from
the
way
he
spoke
i
rather
judged
that
he
had
only
just
got
his
appointment
of
course
you
must
know
in
the
end
he
feels
so
very
full
of
sympathy
for
you
annie
got
up
she
made
an
excuse
to
leave
the
room
she
felt
that
she
could
not
contain
herself
another
moment
give
me
his
address
dear
before
you
go
said
acheson
i
think
it
might
be
best
for
me
to
send
him
a
telegram
where
is
he
staying
annie
turned
stood
bolt
upright
and
uttered
as
if
she
was
charging
the
words
out
of
a
cannon
i
don
t
you
don
t
know
where
your
brother
is
staying
that
does
seem
strange
but
has
he
no
permanent
address
dear
me
mother
said
belle
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
does
that
matter
a
man
with
colchester
s
extensive
tastes
doubtless
cares
little
where
he
lays
his
head
at
night
he
is
i
presume
at
one
of
the
hotels
there
are
many
hotels
in
london
have
you
not
discovered
that
yet
i
never
thought
of
the
hotels
said
acheson
in
an
apologetic
voice
he
did
not
happen
to
tell
you
which
one
he
was
staying
at
my
love
no
said
annie
he
did
that
is
a
but
continued
the
young
girl
i
can
give
him
your
invitation
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
ask
him
i
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
asking
me
to
meet
him
in
regent
s
dear
dear
said
acheson
of
course
he
wants
to
tell
you
this
news
about
india
certainly
my
love
you
shall
go
it
will
be
quite
convenient
and
now
what
do
you
say
to
having
a
nice
drive
i
think
a
little
fresh
air
would
do
you
good
belle
suppose
you
go
for
a
drive
with
annie
i
will
send
round
to
marchand
s
for
a
landau
you
might
take
her
to
really
mother
answered
belle
in
a
tart
and
injured
voice
do
you
suppose
i
have
time
for
such
frivolity
for
a
drive
with
no
object
whatever
except
to
inhale
the
air
do
you
not
understand
that
all
my
life
is
mapped
out
that
each
moment
is
lived
by
rule
this
morning
i
intend
to
make
a
careful
study
of
my
greek
grammar
as
it
is
my
intention
to
write
an
exhaustive
essay
on
the
characteristics
of
the
æolic
dialect
with
illustrations
from
acheson
sighed
and
rose
hastily
you
must
do
as
you
please
belle
of
course
she
said
certainly
dear
mother
i
intend
to
if
annie
likes
she
can
stay
and
help
me
for
she
has
quite
a
good
taste
in
greek
and
a
nice
accent
but
if
on
the
other
hand
she
prefers
the
utter
inanity
of
a
drive
why
surely
you
can
go
with
her
so
i
will
said
acheson
and
i
believe
that
annie
and
i
will
enjoy
the
inanity
as
you
call
it
immensely
annie
we
will
go
to
so
be
it
said
belle
i
do
not
expect
to
see
either
of
you
until
this
evening
i
am
off
at
once
to
my
study
the
greek
dialects
classified
as
ionian
and
are
full
of
the
deepest
she
fled
from
the
room
in
a
sort
of
whirlwind
slamming
the
door
after
her
acheson
looked
at
annie
belle
is
a
dear
good
creature
she
said
in
a
way
but
still
it
seems
a
what
asked
annie
that
she
should
be
quite
so
devoted
to
the
dead
languages
surely
things
of
living
moment
are
much
more
important
well
i
happen
to
be
very
fond
of
the
classics
myself
answered
annie
so
i
ought
not
to
blame
belle
but
she
does
go
to
the
fair
with
the
thing
does
she
not
it
seems
so
to
me
dear
but
then
i
am
comparatively
speaking
an
ignorant
woman
we
women
of
the
last
generation
had
not
the
advantages
which
you
young
creatures
now
receive
what
belle
means
by
the
ionian
and
dialects
i
am
absolutely
ignorant
it
does
not
matter
said
annie
gently
i
agree
with
you
my
love
it
scarcely
matters
much
but
your
pale
cheeks
and
that
anxious
expression
in
your
eyes
matter
a
great
deal
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
annie
understand
that
i
shall
be
only
too
do
you
mean
it
said
annie
she
went
up
to
acheson
the
widow
held
out
her
hand
which
annie
clasped
do
you
really
mean
it
continued
annie
i
do
my
dear
child
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
really
troubles
i
long
to
confide
everything
to
you
replied
annie
but
i
dare
not
please
don
t
ask
me
let
me
be
happy
while
i
am
here
and
don
t
don
t
be
too
kind
what
does
the
poor
child
mean
thought
acheson
she
now
laid
her
hand
on
annie
s
shoulder
drew
her
to
her
side
and
kissed
her
tenderly
on
her
forehead
i
am
drawn
to
you
because
you
are
a
motherless
girl
she
said
and
whenever
you
feel
that
you
can
give
me
your
confidence
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
to
receive
it
and
also
annie
my
dear
to
respect
it
i
am
an
old
woman
and
have
seen
much
of
life
perhaps
i
could
counsel
you
if
you
are
in
any
no
no
it
may
not
be
said
annie
in
a
whisper
which
nearly
choked
her
very
well
we
will
say
no
more
at
present
i
am
going
now
to
give
directions
about
the
at
eleven
o
clock
an
open
landau
was
at
the
door
and
acheson
and
annie
went
for
their
drive
it
was
a
lovely
summer
s
day
and
regent
s
park
looked
its
best
long
years
afterward
annie
colchester
remembered
that
drive
the
delightful
motion
of
the
easy
carriage
in
which
she
was
seated
the
soft
breezes
on
her
cheeks
acheson
s
kind
and
intelligent
conversation
returned
to
her
memory
again
and
again
oh
why
was
life
so
different
for
her
to
what
it
was
for
other
girls
oh
that
she
could
confide
in
acheson
but
then
the
knowledge
that
this
good
woman
pitied
her
because
she
imagined
that
she
was
suffering
from
a
girlish
depression
or
some
other
equally
unimportant
contretemps
caused
her
heart
to
rise
with
wild
rebellion
in
her
breast
if
i
could
tell
her
the
not
her
ears
tingle
and
her
heart
beat
thought
annie
to
herself
good
as
she
is
she
is
not
the
person
to
help
me
in
a
great
calamity
of
this
sort
in
her
quiet
sheltered
prosperous
life
what
can
she
know
of
sorrows
like
mine
oh
rupert
why
were
you
and
i
left
alone
in
the
world
and
did
you
turn
out
bad
and
why
do
i
love
you
so
much
the
drive
was
over
and
the
time
arrived
when
annie
was
to
set
off
to
meet
rupert
in
regent
s
park
she
arrived
at
the
rendezvous
a
minute
or
two
late
and
he
was
already
waiting
for
her
he
still
wore
the
immaculate
and
looked
quite
the
handsome
smart
young
man
of
the
world
but
when
he
saw
annie
coming
to
meet
him
alone
a
heavy
frown
completely
altered
his
expression
his
lips
took
a
sarcastic
and
even
malignant
curve
he
went
up
to
his
sister
and
shook
her
by
the
shoulder
now
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
he
said
but
rupert
s
very
insolence
made
annie
brave
it
means
she
replied
that
i
do
not
intend
to
do
what
you
you
don
t
you
re
a
nice
girl
to
help
a
i
have
made
up
my
mind
continued
annie
i
won
t
ever
do
anything
wrong
to
help
you
oh
you
won
t
won
t
you
then
girl
don
t
you
know
that
i
have
you
completely
in
my
power
if
i
were
to
tell
what
you
did
at
wingfield
you
could
be
arrested
on
a
charge
of
forgery
there
is
an
ugly
punishment
accorded
by
the
law
to
such
you
can
not
frighten
me
rupert
said
annie
much
to
the
astonishment
of
that
gentleman
for
i
have
thought
the
whole
thing
carefully
over
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
me
to
be
punished
and
for
you
to
go
so
for
your
own
safety
you
will
keep
what
you
know
in
the
dark
now
the
thing
for
you
to
consider
is
that
i
do
not
intend
to
help
you
to
get
any
money
from
my
friends
the
rupert
was
so
much
astonished
at
annie
s
tone
that
for
a
moment
he
did
not
reply
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
changed
his
tactics
he
ceased
to
be
furious
and
became
in
the
poor
girl
s
opinion
far
more
dangerous
he
drew
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
invited
her
to
walk
with
him
he
then
proceeded
to
sketch
a
most
vivid
and
graphic
picture
of
his
own
sufferings
the
extreme
danger
in
which
he
stood
and
the
awful
disgrace
which
would
fall
upon
annie
s
devoted
head
when
the
law
of
the
land
took
its
course
upon
him
but
annie
for
some
reason
which
she
did
not
quite
understand
herself
felt
strangely
strong
that
afternoon
perhaps
it
was
acheson
s
kindness
perhaps
it
was
the
thought
of
leslie
and
what
leslie
endured
through
annie
s
former
even
belle
with
all
her
eccentricities
had
a
perceptible
influence
upon
annie
now
for
all
these
good
these
dear
people
look
upon
crime
as
an
impossibility
thought
the
girl
now
rupert
seems
to
take
it
as
the
ordinary
course
of
existence
there
is
no
saying
i
may
get
to
look
at
things
from
his
standpoint
if
i
don
t
take
care
i
dare
not
i
will
never
yield
to
his
so
though
he
begged
of
her
and
implored
of
her
and
bullied
her
and
flattered
her
though
he
used
all
his
eloquence
annie
remained
firm
it
was
the
first
time
in
all
rupert
s
experience
that
he
found
her
so
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
thoroughly
respected
his
sister
at
the
end
of
that
interview
he
saw
that
if
he
was
to
get
anything
out
of
the
achesons
he
must
do
it
in
his
own
way
you
have
astonished
and
pained
me
he
said
at
last
i
never
thought
you
would
desert
me
even
in
my
darkest
hour
i
have
always
thought
well
at
least
there
is
now
my
hour
of
gloom
has
truly
arrived
my
black
hour
come
and
i
am
only
able
to
say
annie
has
deserted
no
answered
annie
i
have
not
really
deserted
you
but
i
will
not
consent
to
drag
either
you
or
myself
any
lower
i
dragged
you
low
enough
when
i
gave
you
that
last
money
i
have
lowered
myself
i
shall
never
be
the
same
again
i
have
also
injured
one
of
the
best
girls
in
the
world
i
bitterly
repent
of
the
sin
which
i
committed
i
am
truly
sorry
for
poor
leslie
now
rupert
you
know
my
yes
it
is
true
what
i
have
just
said
you
have
utterly
forsaken
no
for
i
still
love
oh
don
t
talk
humbug
annie
said
rupert
with
an
angry
interjection
when
you
utter
the
word
love
at
such
a
moment
like
the
present
you
make
me
actually
i
will
not
utter
it
again
said
annie
but
i
can
still
feel
it
rupert
i
will
not
do
wrong
for
you
on
that
point
i
am
firm
now
i
must
leave
you
oh
by
the
way
acheson
gave
me
a
message
for
you
she
wished
to
know
if
you
would
dine
with
them
this
evening
of
course
you
will
not
come
under
the
circumstances
it
would
be
quite
impossible
but
you
may
as
well
send
back
a
polite
say
with
my
compliments
that
i
shall
be
heartily
pleased
to
accept
the
invitation
answered
rupert
how
can
you
dare
will
you
give
the
message
may
i
not
accept
my
own
invitation
or
am
i
to
be
beholden
to
you
well
come
if
you
like
said
poor
annie
i
can
not
quarrel
with
you
nor
argue
with
you
any
longer
come
if
you
wish
to
do
so
but
plainly
understand
that
if
you
attempt
to
ask
belle
acheson
to
lend
you
any
money
i
shall
immediately
tell
the
entire
truth
to
i
believe
you
you
are
turning
into
a
perfect
little
fiend
well
at
any
rate
expect
me

dinner

handwriting
after
annie
and
leslie
had
left
him
parker
returned
to
his
office
there
were
two
or
three
candidates
still
waiting
for
the
vacant
post
of
secretary
one
of
his
clerks
came
to
inquire
what
was
to
be
done
with
them
i
can
not
see
them
was
the
reply
you
may
as
well
say
that
the
matter
is
practically
settled
and
that
there
is
no
use
in
any
of
them
the
clerk
withdrew
and
parker
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
length
of
his
room
well
bless
my
soul
he
said
i
can
not
make
out
what
all
this
means
there
is
a
mystery
somewhere
why
won
t
leslie
gilroy
confess
the
truth
well
if
i
don
t
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
thing
my
name
s
not
charles
parker
i
i
can
not
help
somehow
the
girl
is
innocent
but
appearances
are
much
against
he
opened
a
certain
drawer
in
a
cabinet
which
stood
behind
his
desk
took
from
it
a
letter
and
began
to
read
the
letter
ran
as
follows
dear
parker
i
am
in
great
trouble
and
perplexity
i
have
got
into
a
terrible
scrape
here
and
only
you
can
get
me
out
again
i
dare
not
confide
in
mother
you
alone
can
help
me
will
you
give
my
friend
annie
colchester
sixty
pounds
for
me
and
will
you
give
it
in
notes
and
gold
i
will
never
do
what
i
have
done
again
if
only
you
will
trust
and
forgive
me
this
time
i
can
not
imagine
how
i
have
been
led
into
these
terrible
debts
but
i
can
only
say
i
will
never
incur
another
please
give
the
money
to
annie
at
once
for
the
matter
is
most
urgent
your
affectionate
friend
leslie
there
said
the
good
merchant
to
himself
there
is
her
own
own
statement
in
black
and
white
she
got
into
a
scrape
went
in
debt
and
wanted
me
to
give
her
money
well
if
it
were
only
ordinary
girlish
wish
to
possess
herself
of
and
i
could
forgive
the
child
there
s
a
look
on
her
face
which
makes
it
hard
for
any
man
to
withstand
her
but
the
thing
is
this
she
has
not
made
a
full
statement
she
did
not
want
money
for
ordinary
debts
she
had
another
reason
and
she
would
not
divulge
it
why
did
she
write
to
me
as
she
did
what
can
be
up
pon
my
word
i
feel
quite
frightened
there
s
that
mother
of
hers
the
best
of
good
women
and
that
noble
young
fellow
her
brother
and
the
rest
of
em
plenty
of
character
plenty
of
go
plenty
of
spirit
nothing
mean
or
underhand
about
one
of
them
and
there
s
leslie
whom
all
the
rest
look
up
to
as
the
straightest
of
the
straight
and
the
best
of
the
best
and
who
has
about
the
most
open
face
i
ever
looked
into
and
yet
if
this
letter
is
true
she
is
a
sly
cunning
little
rogue
as
sly
and
cunning
as
can
be
i
pity
the
mother
that
i
do
but
there
is
the
girl
guilty
isn
t
there
some
explanation
of
this
extraordinary
mystery
parker
looked
again
at
the
letter
then
he
folded
it
up
and
was
about
to
put
it
back
into
his
cabinet
when
he
saw
the
paper
on
which
leslie
had
scribbled
her
request
to
him
that
day
lying
on
the
floor
he
stooped
and
picked
it
up
and
the
next
moment
his
red
face
had
turned
pale
for
leslie
s
scribble
carelessly
written
as
it
was
seemed
to
him
to
be
written
in
a
decidedly
different
hand
from
that
of
the
letter
a
moment
later
all
eagerness
quite
trembling
with
excitement
the
shrewd
man
of
business
was
comparing
both
writings
there
was
a
strong
resemblance
most
of
the
capitals
were
formed
in
the
same
way
but
there
was
also
a
distinct
difference
with
lips
and
a
wise
shake
of
his
head
parker
slipped
the
letter
and
the
scrap
of
paper
into
his
pocket
and
left
the
office
on
his
way
out
he
spoke
to
his
head
clerk
hudson
don
t
expect
me
back
i
shall
return
at
my
usual
hour
something
has
happened
to
annoy
the
chief
very
considerably
thought
the
clerk
to
himself
as
parker
s
back
disappeared
through
the
doorway
a
moment
later
the
great
found
himself
in
the
street
the
next
he
had
hailed
a
hansom
and
given
the
address
of
gilroy
s
house
in
west
kensington
i
could
go
by
train
but
a
hansom
will
take
me
quicker
he
muttered
to
himself
i
hope
to
goodness
she
won
t
be
in
it
s
llewellyn
i
wish
to
have
a
chat
with
yes
i
must
investigate
this
matter
and
i
don
t
want
the
mother
to
know
anything
about
it
until
i
can
feel
my
bearings
there
s
a
way
out
of
this
somehow
and
i
believe
the
poor
girl
is
nothing
but
a
dupe
can
it
be
possible
that
she
is
shielding
someone
but
no
that
can
t
be
the
case
for
when
i
went
down
to
wingfield
she
knew
all
about
the
story
and
never
denied
for
a
moment
that
she
had
written
the
letter
she
looked
sorry
enough
but
not
not
surprised
bless
me
if
i
know
what
the
whole
thing
means
these
girls
with
their
modern
education
know
a
thing
too
much
when
they
re
a
match
for
a
shrewd
old
fellow
like
myself
but
i
ll
see
llewellyn
i
ll
sound
him
whatever
when
parker
got
to
the
gilroys
house
it
so
happened
that
llewellyn
himself
was
going
up
the
steps
he
was
just
about
to
put
his
latchkey
into
the
door
when
the
merchant
s
hearty
voice
arrested
him
llewellyn
turned
round
and
a
smile
broke
over
his
face
but
mother
s
out
i
am
afraid

come
in
all
the
same

parker

her
friends
the
chetwynds
one
of
the
girls
is
very
ill
and
the
other
won
t
do
without
i
m
not
specially
surprised
at
that
said
the
merchant
she
seems
the
sort
of
girl
one
would
rely
on
a
good
bit
but
that
is
not
what
i
have
come
about

you
got
a
letter
of
your
sister

letter

llewellyn

what
i

of
your
sister
s
but
i
don
t
understand
said
llewellyn
and
i
don
t
want
you
to
understand
my
boy
i
want
you
just
to
exercise
a
little
bit
of
faith
in
your
father
s
old
friend
and
not
to
say
a
single
word
to
your
mother
about
this
now

and
find
some
letters
of
your
sister
s
when
you
have
found
them
i
want
you
to
put
a
couple
of
them
into
my
care
if
they
contain
any
secrets
you
may
trust
me
not
to
blab
but
this
is
a
serious
matter
and

is
more
in
it
than
meets
the
eye
there
my
boy
just
do
what
you
are
of
course
i
have
got
several
of
leslie

of
a
private
nature
i
will
give
you
one
or
two
sir
with
llewellyn
left
the
room
returning
presently
with
a
packet
of
letters
kept
together
with
an
elastic
band
there
he
said
you
can
have
them
all
sir
i
have
not
even
looked
at
them
leslie
is
as
open
as
the
day
and
there
is
nothing
in
her
letters
that
you
may
not
as
open
as
the
you
really
think
so
she
s
not
a
bit
secretive
now
secretive
my
sister
said
llewellyn
drawing
himself
up
and
flushing
angrily
there
don
t
get
peppery
i
m
very
much
obliged
to
you
you
shall
have
these
letters
back
again
in
a
day
or
two
at
the
but

llewellyn

sir
but
i
fail
to
you
must
have
faith
my
boy
you
will
know
all
sooner
or
with
the
letters
in
his
pocket
parker
went
straight
off
to
scotland
yard
there
he
had
an
interview
with
jones
got
the
address
of
a
special
expert
of
handwriting
and
drove
off
to
the
man
s
house
essex
was
in
and
parker
had
a
short
emphatic
interview
with
him
well
he
said
finally
you
quite
understand
you
will
examine
the
letters
and
let
me
know
the
result
essex
promised
and
the
merchant
went
away
now
he
said
to
himself
if
this
is
a
little
game
which
some
good
people
are
trying
to
hide
from
charles
parker
they
will
quickly
find
themselves
in
the
wrong
chapter
xxxii
who
has
taken
the
key
punctual
to
the
hour
and
in
a
suitable
evening
dress
rupert
colchester
appeared
at
the
achesons
house
acheson
received
him
with
her
usual
kindness
she
was
alone
in
the
room
when
the
young
man
happened
to
put
in
an
appearance
do
you
know
she
said
that
i
am
quite
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
you
by
yourself
i
am
not
at
all
happy
about
your
indeed
replied
rupert
putting
on
a
sympathetic
and
very
interested
air
be
sure
of
this
that
anything
you
may
happen
to
say
to
me
about
annie
will
have
my
most
tender
consideration
and
my
deepest
interest
annie
and
i
are
practically
alone
in
the
world
what
is
wrong
with
the
dear
girl
she
is
very
far
from
well
that
i
can
see
replied
acheson
she
is
also
very
much
depressed
unnaturally
so
and
do
you
know
colchester
that
she
did
not
know
anything
about
your
appointment
in
the
civil
service
she
was
amazed
when
i
told
her
you
were
going
to
ah
said
rupert
thoughtfully
tapping
the
back
of
his
heel
against
the
brass
rail
of
the
fireplace
i
felt
sure
she
would
feel
it
dreadfully
the
fact
is
up
to
the
present
i
have
not
dared
to
break
the
news
to
her
she
is
so
intensely
affectionate
of
course
i
intended
to
do
so
now
that
you
have
done
so
it
is
a
great
relief
to
me
she
will
not
feel
it
so
dreadfully
after
a
little
and
i
know
i
can
buoy
her
up
with
hope
for
my
intention
is
that
she
shall
join
me
in
a
year
or
two
she
shall
be
my
housekeeper
until
she
enters
a
good
home
of
her
own
i
could
not
think
of
marrying
until
my
dear
annie
had
a
home
of
her
i
felt
certain
that
you
had
a
good
motive
in
keeping
the
important
news
back
from
her
replied
innocent
acheson
and
i
respect
you
all
the
more
for
your
just
at
that
instant
belle
and
annie
entered
the
room
belle
wore
her
best
dress
it
was
not
much
to
look
at
but
something
very
great
and
uncommon
must
have
induced
her
to
put
it
on
it
was
made
of
soft
black
silk
and
had
ruffles
of
lace
round
the
neck
and
wrists
she
wore
also
a
very
narrow
gold
chain
round
her
neck
when
rupert
spoke
to
her
belle
found
herself
blushing
dinner
was
announced
acheson
asked
him
to
take
her
daughter
down
and
she
herself
conducted
annie
to
the
annie
had
made
no
attempt
to
improve
her
appearance
she
sat
feeling
shy
and
uncomfortable
scarcely
opening
her
lips
while
rupert
carried
the
conversation
his
own
way
he
was
a
clever
man
and
he
contrived
on
the
present
occasion
to
make
himself
quite
brilliant
he
talked
about
india
spoke
of
the
liner
in
which
he
was
going
out
turned
aside
to
annie
to
say
i
will
explain
everything
to
you
my
dear
presently
told
good
stories
about
his
early
life
in
america
and
then
about
his
education
in
london
and
managed
to
delight
both
acheson
and
belle
by
the
peep
he
gave
them
into
a
world
which
they
had
never
entered
his
manners
to
belle
were
all
that
could
be
desired
he
was
extremely
courteous
and
deferential
and
managed
to
convey
a
touch
of
admiration
which
was
never
unduly
obtrusive
such
a
strong
effect
did
he
have
upon
her
that
she
forgot
her
beloved
classics
as
she
listened
to
him
the
meal
came
to
an
end
and
when
the
ladies
rose
rupert
accompanied
them
to
the
no
wine
for
me
thanks
he
said
i
am
practically
a
he
then
drew
a
chair
near
belle
s
side
and
contrived
to
draw
her
into
a
literary
conversation
of
deep
interest
annie
felt
on
thorns
as
she
watched
the
two
more
firmly
each
moment
was
she
making
up
her
mind
if
rupert
dared
to
ask
belle
to
lend
him
any
of
the
money
in
the
wooden
box
she
would
confess
all
she
felt
herself
a
hypocrite
and
could
scarcely
stand
acheson
s
kind
and
affectionate
remarks
at
last
the
slow
evening
came
to
an
end
by
this
time
rupert
had
perambulated
almost
every
foot
of
the
he
had
stood
close
to
the
his
hand
had
touched
it
it
was
when
he
was
looking
at
belle
s
precious
greek
testament
which
lay
on
top
of
it
rupert
quoted
a
few
sentences
out
of
the
testament
in
his
melodious
voice
to
belle
who
nodded
and
praised
his
accent
he
then
went
and
stood
in
the
deep
embrasure
of
the
window
looked
out
at
the
moon
which
threw
its
radiance
over
the
garden
outside
and
all
of
a
sudden
without
the
least
warning
began
to
talk
of
burglars
this
is
a
very
nice
house
he
said
but
with
that
garden
at
the
back
it
is
not
too
safe
and
you
have
no
men
on
the
premises
have
you
no
said
belle
but
i
don
t
understand
what
you
well
i
have
the
greatest
dread
of
burglars
breaking
into
a
house
inhabited
only
by
oh
we
are
not
at
all
afraid
replied
belle
who
would
burgle
here
we
have
no
special
valuables
a
very
little
silver
no
more
besides
the
windows
are
all
thoroughly
she
showed
the
device
of
the
latch
to
rupert
who
said
it
was
clever
very
ingenious
indeed
a
moment
or
two
afterwards
he
took
his
leave
as
he
did
so
he
nodded
to
annie
see
you
little
sis
he
said
cheer
up
about
india
old
girl
you
shall
come
and
join
me
by
and
acheson
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
have
enjoyed
my
to
belle
he
did
not
say
a
word
about
his
special
enjoyment
but
he
gave
her
a
look
full
of
eloquence
she
found
herself
blushing
and
her
heart
beat
a
trifle
quicker
than
its
wont
when
the
closed
behind
him
both
ladies
were
eloquent
in
his
praise
a
charming
fellow
and
what
a
nice
expression
said
acheson
he
is
a
clever
which
is
better
than
being
a
charming
man
said
belle
he
has
a
great
and
sincere
respect
for
all
learning
in
his
way
he
is
an
enthusiast
i
do
not
care
for
conversation
with
men
as
a
rule
but
i
must
own
that
i
respect
colchester
and
enjoy
talking
to
him
he
is
so
sincere
and
so
may
i
go
to
bed
said
annie
suddenly
i
have
a
bad
headache
and
should
like
to
lie
oh
poor
child
said
acheson
i
do
hope
you
are
not
sickening
for
anything
dear
you
have
looked
so
ill
since
you
have
been
with
us
will
you
have
some
or
what
do
you
take
when
you
have
bad
headaches
nothing
answered
annie
i
lie
down
and
try
to
she
hurried
from
the
room
scarcely
waiting
to
bid
either
lady
acheson
and
belle
sat
up
a
little
longer
then
they
also
retired
for
the
night
annie
had
lain
down
on
her
bed
without
undressing
it
is
true
she
pulled
the
counterpane
over
her
in
case
acheson
or
belle
should
come
into
the
room
but
sleep
was
far
from
her
wakeful
eyes
by
and
by
the
house
grew
quiet
she
heard
the
servants
going
up
to
their
attics
overhead
she
heard
acheson
shut
herself
into
her
own
room
and
belle
shut
herself
into
hers
belle
slept
with
her
door
locked
and
annie
heard
the
key
being
turned
a
few
moments
later
profound
silence
fell
upon
the
house
the
lights
were
all
out
one
by
one
the
inhabitants
slept
all
but
annie
who
lay
with
every
nerve
tingling
and
her
sense
of
waiting
preternaturally
acute
while
rupert
had
been
in
the
house
she
had
followed
all
his
movements
with
a
terrible
knowledge
of
him
and
his
ways
which
gave
her
the
clew
to
much
that
he
was
doing
when
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
wooden
box
annie
felt
as
if
a
hand
had
touched
her
own
heart
when
he
stood
by
the
window
she
could
scarcely
contain
her
uneasiness
when
he
spoke
about
burglars
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
whole
of
what
was
immediately
to
follow
was
laid
bare
to
her
rupert
was
in
desperate
straits
he
would
stop
at
nothing
to
achieve
his
object
was
it
possible
that
he
the
man
whom
annie
loved
whose
father
had
been
good
and
respectable
whose
mother
had
been
one
of
the
gentlest
and
sweetest
of
women
would
stoop
as
low
as
this
alas
annie
feared
it
now
was
her
time
for
action
she
slipped
softly
out
of
bed
unfastened
her
door
without
making
any
noise
and
glided
down
through
the
silent
house
and
miss
acheson
were
both
sound
sleepers
the
servants
were
far
away
she
reached
the
ground
floor
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
found
the
door
locked
from
the
outside
taking
great
care
she
unlocked
it
still
without
making
any
sound
then
in
her
stockinged
feet
she
crossed
the
room
and
took
her
place
in
shadow
close
to
the
window
where
rupert
had
stood
that
evening
the
moon
was
still
up
and
its
light
fell
across
the
room
the
had
three
large
windows
with
venetian
blinds
it
looked
on
to
a
garden
the
windows
were
not
more
than
three
feet
from
the
ground
annie
now
observed
with
increased
apprehension
that
the
blind
to
this
window
was
up
she
instantly
remembered
that
it
had
got
out
of
order
that
morning
and
heard
acheson
say
that
she
must
send
for
a
man
to
repair
it
rupert
must
have
also
noticed
that
fact
as
he
stood
with
belle
close
to
the
window
annie
got
still
deeper
into
the
shadow
of
the
thick
curtains
and
waited
all
too
soon
she
heard
just
what
she
expected
to
in
the
garden
outside
the
steps
approached
the
window
the
bright
flood
of
moonlight
was
broken
by
a
huge
shadow
a
man
was
standing
on
the
annie
did
not
stir
she
heard
the
grating
noise
of
a
small
diamond
against
the
glass
a
square
was
quickly
cut
out
a
hand
and
arm
intruded
themselves
and
the
hasp
the
construction
of
which
had
been
explained
to
rupert
by
belle
was
quickly
unfastened
the
next
instant
the
window
was
lifted
and
rupert
colchester
stepped
into
the
room
he
went
at
once
to
the
table
where
the
wooden
box
stood
laid
his
hand
on
it
and
was
about
to
turn
back
when
annie
making
a
sudden
movement
confronted
him
standing
in
the
white
light
caused
by
the
moon
you
must
put
that
box
back
rupert
said
annie
if
you
don
t
i
shall
call
her
sudden
and
appearance
and
her
brave
words
staggered
the
man
he
was
holding
the
box
in
his
hand
he
dropped
it
now
in
his
agitation
before
he
could
stoop
to
pick
it
up
annie
had
snatched
at
it
flown
across
the
room
and
put
it
out
into
the
hall
she
then
locked
the
door
and
slipped
the
key
into
her
pocket
now
rupert
she
said
coming
back
to
him
the
window
is
open
and
you
can
go
i
know
you
won
t
injure
me
for
after
all
however
wicked

are
i
am
your
own
sister
and
the
only
person
in
all
the
world
who
loves
you
you
can
go
rupert
you
can
escape
the
way
is
clear
but
steal
that
box
you
don
t
i
would
rather
die
than
let
by
this
time
the
astonished
and
discomfited
man
had
found
his
voice
i
have
not
come
here
to
be
betrayed
by
you
he
said
i
am
desperate
so
you
had
best
leave
me
alone
give
me
the
key
of
the
door
this
minute
if
you
don
t
i
shall
take
it
by
rupert
i
hear
someone
stirring
overhead
acheson
has
heard
you
already
oh
go
for
heaven
s
a
nice
position
you
ll
be
in
he
said
with
a
sneer
the
noise
in
the
room
above
was
more
audible
than
ever
someone
was
heard
walking
across
it
you
ve
done
for
me
he
cried
a
nice
sister
you
are
yes
i
suppose
i
had
best
hook
steps
were
now
heard
coming
downstairs
rupert
scowling
at
annie
made
a
rush
to
the
window
put
his
foot
over
the
ledge
and
disappeared
he
had
scarcely
done
so
before
acheson
s
voice
was
heard
calling
at
the
other
side
of
the
locked
door
is
anybody
in
this
room
she
cried
who
has
taken
the
key
what
is
wrong
annie
thought
for
a
moment
she
then
walked
straight
to
the
door
and
flung
it
open
how
you
frightened
me
said
acheson
coming
in
my
dear
child
what
is
the
matter
how
terrible
you
look
what
is
wrong
i
have
had
a
fright
replied
annie
there
has
been
an
attempt
at
she
shook
all
over
don
t
question
me
now
for
i
can
not
bear
it
she
said
it
is
has
not
taken
it
do
you
see
the
square
cut
out
of
that
pane
of
glass
he
came
in
that
way
he
was
just
about
to
take
the
box
when
i
showed
the
box
child
what
box
belle
s
wooden
what
that
wooden
box
that
belle
keeps
full
of
coins
yes
the
same
i
saved
it
it
is
in
the
hall
feel
a
little
poor
child
no
wonder
what
a
terrible
scare
you
have
had
who
would
have
supposed
that
burglars
would
come
to
us
well
dear
if
the
box
had
been
stolen
how
disappointed
they
would
have
been
to
find
only
ordinary
coins
but
come
upstairs
annie
i
must
get
you
some
at
acheson
dragged
annie
upstairs
then
went
to
the
servants
awoke
them
and
sent
two
of
them
off
immediately
to
the
nearest
she
questioned
annie
still
further
with
regard
to
the
burglary
but
could
get
little
or
nothing
out
of
her
and
concluded
that
she
was
stunned
by
the
sudden
shock
it
was
not
until
the
widow
had
gone
back
to
her
room
that
she
remembered
how
very
strange
it
was
that
annie
should
have
locked
the
door
how
still
stranger
it
was
for
annie
to
be
in
the
at
all
she
was
not
naturally
suspicious
but
these
circumstances
did
cause
her
a
little
serious
thought
when
the
morning
dawned
she
went
to
her
daughter
s
bedroom
belle
had
heard
nothing
of
the
adventures
of
the
previous
night
and
was
considerably
annoyed
when
her
mother
rattled
the
handle
of
the
locked
door
and
asked
for
admission
belle
opened
the
door
and
then
stood
somewhat
crossly
waiting
for
acheson
to
speak
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
the
widow
related
what
had
occurred
said
that
she
had
found
annie
in
the
with
the
door
locked
and
belle
s
wooden
box
of
coins
at
the
other
side
my
coins
my
treasures
said
belle
color
and
animation
rushing
into
her
face
how
brave
of
dear
annie
how
splendid
of
her
i
know
why
she
did
it
it
is
unnecessary
to
explain
the
matter
to
you
just
at
present
mother
i
can
only
say
that
the
box
was
full
of
valuables
and
dear
brave
little
annie
has
rescued
them
oh
she
and
i
must
indeed
be
one
after
this
all
during
the
remainder
of
our
lives
how
queer
mother
it
was
only
last
night
colchester
said
something
about
burglars
he
seemed
to
think
we
were
in
danger
with
the
window
so
close
to
the
ground
and
looking
into
the
garden
but
i
explained
to
him
the
ingenious
way
in
which
the
windows
were
fastened
and
then
he
seemed
to
think
we
were
absolutely
safe
i
must
go
at
once
now
to
dear
annie
and
thank
i
wish
you
would
belle
she
was
very
sad
last
night
poor
child
but
my
dear
i
never
knew
there
were
valuables
in
the
box
you
only
spoke
of
coins
of
the
realm
said
belle
with
a
laugh
very
nearly
one
hundred
pounds
money
i
have
saved
from
my
college
expenses
for
a
noble
purpose
don
t
question
me
now
mother
i
will
tell
you
by
and
belle
put
on
her
and
ran
across
the
landing
to
annie
s
door
she
knocked
there
was
no
answer
she
turned
the
handle
and
entered
annie
s
bed
was
herself
had
disappeared
chapter
xxxiii
confession
yes
annie
colchester
had
made
up
her
mind
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
she
must
see
parker
without
a
moment
s
delay
make
full
confession
and
fling
herself
upon
his
mercy
even
prison
would
be
better
than
this
present
agony
thought
the
poor
girl
whatever
happens
i
can
not
face
the
achesons
again
without
their
knowing
the
with
the
first
dawn
she
rose
and
dressed
and
then
wrote
a
little
note
to
acheson
you
will
think
badly
of
me
and
no
wonder
wrote
annie
the
man
who
tried
to
steal
the
wooden
box
last
night
was
my
brother
rupert
yes
he
was
my
brother
he
cut
the
square
of
glass
out
of
the
window
and
entered
your
house
as
a
common
burglar
pray
don
t
do
anything
until
you
hear
from
me
again
i
am
going
to
belle
found
this
note
read
its
contents
flushed
slowly
all
over
rubbed
her
forehead
in
a
distracted
way
and
then
hiding
the
note
in
the
pocket
of
her
returned
to
her
own
room
poor
annie
has
gone
out
of
her
mind
she
said
to
herself
mr
colchester
that
charming
scholarly
delightful
man
enter
the
house
in
order
to
take
my
box
of
i
should
not
believe
it
if
a
thousand
annie
colchesters
swore
to
it
this
note
is
my
property
and
i
refuse
to
divulge
its
contents
for
the
meanwhile
annie
wandered
about
the
streets
until
it
was
time
for
parker
to
appear
at
his
office
he
had
been
called
unexpectedly
out
of
town
on
the
previous
day
or
events
would
have
come
to
an
issue
before
now
on
his
arrival
this
morning
he
looked
eagerly
through
his
correspondence
and
had
just
taken
up
the
letter
from
the
expert
and
was
reading
its
contents
when
his
clerk
entered
said
that
miss
colchester
had
called
that
she
looked
in
serious
trouble
and
wished
to
see
parker
without
delay
ask
miss
colchester
into
my
and
say
i
will
send
for
her
presently
was
the
reply
the
clerk
withdrew
parker
continued
to
read
the
expert
s
letter
i
thought
so
he
said
to
himself
he
says
the
writings
are
not
identical
that
they
have
not
been
written
by
the
same
person
miss
annie
little
knows
what
a
trap
she
has
got
into
she
is
just
here
in
the
nick
of
time
yes
i
will
see
her
i
will
get
the
whole
naked
truth
out
of
her
guilty
of
course
she
is
guilty
after
she
has
made
her
confession
she
shall
come
with
me
to
the
gilroys
what
an
old
blind
fool
i
have
been
how
could
i
ever
doubt
a
girl
with
a
face
like
leslie
s
he
stood
up
as
he
spoke
the
expert
s
letter
had
pleased
him
but
he
could
not
but
own
that
he
felt
nearly
as
puzzled
as
ever
bless
me
if
i
know
what
it
means
even
now
he
said
anxiously
to
himself
the
puzzled
man
was
standing
on
his
hearth
his
hair
was
wildly
rubbed
over
his
head
and
his
eyes
looked
fiercer
than
annie
had
ever
seen
them
when
she
entered
the
room
well
miss
colchester
he
said
may
i
ask
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
visit
it
so
happens
that
i
am
anxious
to
see
you
and
should
have
called
upon
you
if
you
had
not
come
to
me
but
as
a
rule
i
do
not
see
people
on
private
business
in
my
i
have
come
to
speak
to
you
about
leslie
gilroy
said
annie
you
are
fond
of
leslie
it
does
not
matter
to
you
whether
i
care
for
her
or
not
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
her
only
that
she
is
quite
innocent
said
annie
she
never
wrote
that
parker
s
face
wore
an
ugly
sneer
i
wonder
now
he
said
coming
a
step
or
two
forward
if
you
have
been
following
me
about
on
the
sly
for
the
last
day
or
two
do
you
happen
to
know
that
i
had
taken
that
letter
and
also
the
writing
leslie
gilroy
left
here
the
other
day
to
essex
the
expert
you
are
sharp
enough
to
know
most
things
did
you
find
out
about
that
i
don
t
know
what
you
my
meaning
is
plain
enough
it
is
better
to
make
confession
before
open
detection
is
it
not
i
don
t
know
anything
continued
annie
i
have
never
heard
of
essex
before
i
am
the
most
wretched
miserable
girl
in
the
world
i
came
to
you
to
confess
not
knowing
that
you
were
able
to
expose
me
it
does
not
matter
now
in
the
very
least
whether
you
expose
me
or
not
for
i
am
going
to
expose
myself
i
did
write
that
letter
i
knew
at
the
time
that
it
was
forgery
but
i
was
desperate
rupert
wanted
sixty
pounds
he
said
that
if
he
did
not
get
the
money
he
would
be
locked
up
the
police
were
already
after
him
he
owed
the
money
for
a
debt
of
such
a
nature
that
if
he
did
not
pay
it
he
would
be
locked
well
all
this
is
coming
to
the
point
with
a
vengeance
said
parker
annie
clutched
hold
of
the
nearest
chair
to
steady
herself
i
am
miserable
and
i
know
that
i
deserve
imprisonment
or
anything
you
like
to
give
me
she
said
we
will
leave
out
the
question
about
your
deservings
for
the
present
said
the
merchant
what
i
want
is
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
well
i
did
it
said
annie
i
did
commit
forgery
i
was
nearly
mad
i
have
always
loved
rupert
better
than
i
ought
he
was
my
only
brother
and
could
never
turn
from
him
it
was
idolatry
and
i
am
go
on
with
your
story
said
parker
i
am
doing
so
only
you
must
give
me
time
rupert
wanted
the
money
and
i
was
distracted
leslie
and
i
were
roomfellows
she
was
always
good
to
a
nice
return
you
have
made
for
her
i
know
that
well
but
you
can
not
understand
the
temptation
there
i
don
t
mean
to
excuse
myself
on
the
very
evening
when
i
saw
rupert
and
found
out
all
about
his
trouble
leslie
talked
about
you
i
was
so
startled
to
find
that
she
also
knew
you
she
told
me
what
you
were
doing
for
her
how
liberal
you
were
with
your
money
how
very
kind
she
said
that
her
father
had
been
your
greatest
friend
and
that
you
had
made
a
sort
of
promise
to
help
his
children
as
she
spoke
a
desperate
idea
came
into
my
head
i
was
always
very
clever
at
imitating
handwriting
and
there
was
plenty
of
leslie
s
about
the
idea
of
making
her
appear
to
write
to
you
for
money
came
into
my
brain
and
would
not
go
away
again
i
thought
of
it
all
night
and
the
scheme
seemed
almost
impossible
to
be
detected
and
was
my
last
and
only
resource
i
rose
very
early
got
hold
of
some
of
leslie
s
handwriting
copied
it
carefully
wrote
the
letter
which
i
brought
to
you
got
permission
to
go
to
london
from
miss
lauderdale
and
saw
you
that
afternoon
you
gave
me
the
money
i
took
it
back
i
gave
it
to
but
even
now
i
do
not
understand
said
parker
i
came
down
to
wingfield
the
next
day
i
was
very
much
disturbed
i
can
tell
you
that
letter
which
seemed
to
be
leslie
s
shook
my
faith
i
always
considered
her
the
finest
sweetest
girl
i
had
ever
come
across
like
very
like
one
whom
i
have
lost
but
no
matter
you
are
unworthy
to
hear
that
name
i
came
to
wingfield
and
i
saw
leslie
and
she
knew
all
about
it
she
did
not
deny
that
is
because
she
was
noble
i
was
obliged
to
tell
her
the
truth
and
she
resolved
to
screen
me
and
take
the
pon
my
word
i
never
heard
anything
like
this
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
said
parker
noble
i
should
think
she
was
but
what
were
you
made
of
you
allowed
her
think
what
she
suffered
i
distrusted
her
and
you
allowed
her
to
screen
i
did
for
rupert
s
sake
i
know
i
was
bad
but
i
was
not
wholly
bad
she
knew
that
if
it
were
discovered
i
should
be
expelled
from
wode
s
and
my
chance
in
life
would
be
over
so
she
agreed
to
screen
me
i
didn
t
guess
at
the
time
how
much
she
would
suffer
and
what
it
would
mean
to
her
leslie
saw
rupert
and
told
him
that
if
he
would
leave
the
country
and
never
return
she
would
keep
his
secret
and
mine
rupert
promised
to
go
away
he
went
and
i
thought
i
should
never
see
him
again
then
i
lost
my
interest
in
my
work
i
found
i
could
not
study
and
when
i
passed
my
exam
i
only
took
an
ordinary
and
my
prospects
were
more
or
less
ruined
i
was
terribly
poor
for
the
little
money
that
i
had
saved
i
had
already
given
to
my
brother
when
my
own
money
was
nearly
gone
i
went
to
leslie
that
was
a
few
days
ago
i
heard
that
you
wanted
a
secretary
and
i
begged
and
implored
of
her
to
ask
you
to
give
me
the
post
leslie
did
not
like
asking
you
she
said
you
were
terribly
changed
to
her
but
at
last
she
consented
she
came
here
with
me
you
told
her
that
if
she
told
the
real
truth
about
the
money
you
would
give
me
the
post
how
could
she
tell
you
the
truth
without
ruining
me
we
both
knew
it
was
all
up
then
although
she
implored
me
at
the
eleventh
hour
to
make
confession
but
i
could
could
i
without
ruining
rupert
you
conscience
has
become
very
tender
since
then
said
parker
how
is
it
you
are
here
this
morning
i
will
tell
you
because
rupert
himself
has
opened
my
eyes
oh
i
love
him
still
yes
i
love
him
still
but
my
heart
is
broken
i
don
t
care
what
happens
to
me
friends
of
mine
of
the
name
of
acheson
asked
me
to
stay
with
them
for
a
week
i
had
only
fourteen
shillings
in
the
world
and
i
thought
i
would
go
acheson
was
very
was
like
a
mother
to
me
but
on
the
very
day
i
went
on
the
day
i
saw
you
last
i
met
my
brother
he
had
never
gone
away
he
had
broken
his
word
to
leslie
he
had
got
into
fresh
awful
trouble
he
wanted
more
and
more
money
and
oh
parker
last
night
he
broke
into
the
very
house
where
i
was
staying
in
order
to
steal
some
money
which
was
in
the
what
am
i
to
do
oh
if
i
might
only
die
the
miserable
girl
fell
on
her
knees
burying
her
face
in
a
chair
near
by
her
faint
sobs
sounded
through
the
room
parker
stood
still
for
a
moment
the
color
in
his
face
was
coming
and
going
what
was
he
to
do
he
hated
annie
colchester
and
yet
from
the
bottom
of
his
soul
he
pitied
her
before
he
could
decide
anything
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
particularly
engaged
just
now
he
called
out
it
s
miss
gilroy
sir
she
wants
to
see
you
as
soon
as
miss
gilroy
bless
my
soul
what
can
she
have
come
about
oh
do
let
her
in
i
know
she
will
plead
for
me
she
will
ask
you
not
to
be
too
bitterly
hard
said
poor
annie
parker
opened
the
door
come
right
in
leslie
he
said
his
manner
had
changed
there
was
a
tremble
in
his
deep
voice
leslie
came
eagerly
forward
i
have
come
to
ask
you
if
you
know
anything
about
annie
colchester
she
began
we
are
in
dreadful
trouble
about
her
she
has
disappeared
why
what
is
it
you
seem
to
know
something
what
is
wrong
only
that
i
have
learned
the
truth
at
last
leslie
annie
colchester
is
here
she
has
confessed
everything
stand
up
annie
and
speak
this
but
annie
was
past
this
her
head
was
buried
in
her
hands
and
sobs
shook
her
frame
leslie
gave
one
glance
from
parker
to
annie
and
then
sprang
forward
she
fell
on
her
knees
by
annie
s
side
and
put
her
arms
round
her
oh
poor
poor
annie
have
you
really
confessed
said
leslie
it
was
brave
of
you
dear
it
was
she
put
her
arms
round
annie
s
neck
and
began
to
kiss
her
oh
you
don
t
know
how
she
has
been
tried
and
tempted
she
continued
turning
to
the
merchant
you
can
not
be
angry
with
her
any
longer
even
the
worst
sinner
ought
to
be
forgiven
when
he
confesses
and
annie
is
sorry
so
leslie
s
kisses
fell
on
annie
s
hot
cheeks
like
rain
after
a
time
annie
slightly
moved
her
position
and
stole
one
arm
softly
round
leslie
s
neck
parker
looked
at
the
two
bless
my
soul
this
will
upset
me
he
muttered
to
himself
never
met
a
girl
like
leslie
it
makes
one
believe
in
christianity
that
it
he
suddenly
left
the
room
an
hour
later
he
came
back
annie
was
now
quite
collected
and
calm
she
had
told
leslie
everything
leslie
went
straight
up
to
parker
and
took
his
hand
you
have
got
to
do
something
for
me
she
said
i
ll
do
anything
for
you
leslie
i
feel
fit
to
die
when
i
think
how
i
mistrusted
you
had
good
reasons
to
mistrust
me
and
i
am
not
the
least
surprised
you
need
not
reproach
yourself
in
the
very
least
now
if
you
will
do
something
if
you
will
grant
me
a
great
great
favor
i
shall
be
the
happiest
of
girls
i
shall
gladly
rejoice
in
the
thought
of
my
past
suffering
if
it
can
help
annie
you
want
a
favor
for
her
i
do
and
i
know
you
will
grant
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
refuse
you
anything
but
what
is
it
i
want
you
to
do
this
i
don
t
wish
rupert
colchester
bad
as
he
is
to
be
locked
up
i
want
him
to
leave
the
country
i
want
you
to
see
that
he
goes
he
must
be
seen
off
for
annie
is
not
to
be
persecuted
by
him
any
longer
when
he
is
away
i
want
annie
to
become
your
secretary
i
will
be
responsible
for
her
conduct
for
her
probity
and
honesty
she
shall
come
and
live
at
my
mother
s
and
she
shall
work
for
you
annie
must
be
saved
oh
i
love
her
parker
i
love
her
notwithstanding
her
sin
she
was
terribly
tempted
you
and
i
do
not
know
anything
of
such
temptation
but
now
we
will
save
her
won
t
we
will
you
do
this
for
my
sake
i
declare
i
d
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
but
it
s
rather
a
big
order
i
shan
t
mind
helping
that
poor
girl
but
the
brother
is
he
to
go
off
for
annie
s
sake
yes
it
would
hurt
her
too
terribly
if
he
were
punished
give
him
one
last
chance
parker
he
may
be
saved
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
oh
you
are
the
best
man
i
know
prove
it
and
this
would
make
you
quite
happy
my
dear
it
would
make
me
so
happy
i
should
scarcely
know
how
to
contain
myself
oh
say
yes
here
and
then
here
is
my
hand
on
it
i
say
it
here
and
parker
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
was
not
a
man
to
do
things
by
and
he
did
not
lose
an
hour
in
taking
means
to
discover
rupert
colchester
s
whereabouts
he
found
that
young
man
hiding
from
the
police
gave
him
such
a
talking
to
that
even
he
felt
a
little
ashamed
and
finally
securing
a
berth
for
him
on
board
a
vessel
which
was
bound
for
australia
saw
him
off
himself
on
the
following
day
the
curtain
drops
forever
on
rupert
as
far
as
this
story
is
concerned
annie
is
happy
at
last
notwithstanding
her
great
trials
she
is
very
busy
and
has
little
time
to
think
she
makes
an
excellent
secretary
is
painstaking
persevering
clever
and
affectionate
parker
does
not
like
to
own
it
but
he
is
really
getting
very
fond
of
her
and
actually
asks
her
advice
on
several
matters
in
the
most
unwarrantable
and
unbusinesslike
manner
annie
lives
with
gilroy
who
is
as
kind
as
kind
can
be

she
is
less
arrogant
than
formerly
although
she
still
firmly
believes
that
the
true
aim
of
a

delve
in

not
