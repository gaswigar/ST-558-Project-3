book
i
as
seen
by
two
strangers
poinsettias
a
remarkable
man
it
was
not
my
husband
speaking
but
some
passerby
however
i
looked
up
at
george
with
a
smile
and
found
him
looking
down
at
me
with
much
the
same
humour
we
had
often
spoken
of
the
odd
phrases
one
hears
in
the
street
and
how
interesting
it
would
be
sometimes
to
hear
a
little
more
of
the
conversation
that
s
a
case
in
point
he
laughed
as
he
guided
me
through
the
crowd
of
which
invariably
block
this
part
of
broadway
at
the
hour
of
eight
we
shall
never
know
whose
eulogy
we
have
just
heard
a
remarkable
man
there
are
not
many
of
no
was
my
somewhat
indifferent
reply
it
was
a
keen
winter
night
and
snow
was
packed
upon
the
walks
in
a
way
to
throw
into
sharp
relief
the
figures
of
such
pedestrians
as
happened
to
be
walking
alone
but
it
seems
to
me
that
so
far
as
general
appearance
goes
the
one
in
front
answers
your
description
most
i
pointed
to
a
man
hurrying
around
the
corner
just
ahead
of
us
yes
he
s
remarkably
well
built
i
noticed
him
when
he
came
out
of
the
this
was
a
hotel
we
had
just
passed
but
it
s
not
only
that
it
s
his
height
his
very
striking
features
his
expression
i
stopped
suddenly
gripping
george
s
arm
convulsively
in
a
surprise
he
appeared
to
share
we
had
turned
the
corner
immediately
behind
the
man
of
whom
we
were
speaking
and
so
had
him
still
in
full
view
what
s
he
doing
i
asked
in
a
low
whisper
we
were
only
a
few
feet
behind
look
look
don
t
you
call
that
curious
my
husband
stared
then
uttered
a
low
the
man
ahead
of
us
presenting
in
every
respect
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
had
suddenly
stooped
to
the
kerb
and
was
washing
his
hands
in
the
snow
furtively
but
with
a
vigour
and
purpose
which
could
not
fail
to
arouse
the
strangest
conjectures
in
any
chance
onlooker
pilate
escaped
my
lips
in
a
sort
of
nervous
chuckle
but
george
shook
his
head
at
me
i
don
t
like
it
he
muttered
with
unusual
gravity
did
you
see
his
face
then
as
the
man
rose
and
hurried
away
from
us
down
the
street
i
should
like
to
follow
him
i
do
believe
but
here
we
became
aware
of
a
quick
rush
and
sudden
clamour
around
the
corner
we
had
just
left
and
turning
quickly
saw
that
something
had
occurred
on
broadway
which
was
fast
causing
a
tumult
what
s
the
matter
i
cried
what
can
have
happened
let
s
go
see
george
perhaps
it
has
something
to
do
with
our
my
husband
with
a
final
glance
down
the
street
at
the
fast
disappearing
figure
yielded
to
my
importunity
and
possibly
to
some
new
curiosity
of
his
own
i
d
like
to
stop
that
man
first
said
he
but
what
excuse
have
i
he
may
be
nothing
but
a
crank
with
some
idea
in
his
head
we
ll
soon
know
for
there
s
certainly
something
wrong
there
on
he
came
out
of
the
clermont
i
suggested
i
know
if
the
excitement
isn
t
there
what
we
ve
just
seen
is
simply
a
then
as
we
retraced
our
steps
to
the
corner
whatever
we
hear
or
see
don
t
say
anything
about
this
man
it
s
after
eight
remember
and
we
promised
adela
that
we
would
be
at
the
house
before
i
ll
be
it
was
the
last
word
he
had
time
to
speak
before
we
found
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
men
and
women
jostling
one
another
in
curiosity
or
in
the
consternation
following
a
quick
alarm
all
were
looking
one
way
and
as
this
was
towards
the
entrance
of
the
clermont
it
was
evident
enough
to
us
that
the
alarm
had
indeed
had
its
origin
in
the
very
place
we
had
anticipated
i
felt
my
husband
s
arm
press
me
closer
to
his
side
as
we
worked
our
way
towards
the
entrance
and
presently
caught
a
warning
sound
from
his
lips
as
the
oaths
and
confused
cries
everywhere
surrounding
us
were
broken
here
and
there
by
articulate
words
and
we
heard
is
it
murder
the
beautiful
miss
challoner
a
millionairess
in
her
own
right
killed
they
no
no
suddenly
dead
that
s
george
what
shall
we
do
i
managed
to
cry
into
my
husband
s
ear
get
out
of
this
there
is
no
chance
of
our
reaching
that
door
and
i
can
t
have
you
standing
round
any
longer
in
this
icy
but
but
is
it
right
i
urged
in
an
importunate
whisper
should
we
go
home
while
he
hush
my
first
duty
is
to
you
we
will
go
make
our
visit
but
i
can
t
wait
till
i
pleaded
wild
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
in
regard
to
an
event
in
which
i
naturally
felt
a
keen
personal
interest
he
drew
me
as
near
to
the
edge
of
the
crowd
as
he
could
there
were
new
murmurs
all
about
us
if
it
s
a
case
of
why
send
for
the
police
asked
one
it
is
better
to
have
an
officer
or
two
here
grumbled
another
here
comes
a
well
i
m
going
to
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
do
whispered
george
who
for
all
his
bluster
was
as
curious
as
myself
we
will
try
the
rear
door
where
there
are
fewer
persons
possibly
we
can
make
our
way
in
there
and
if
we
can
slater
will
tell
us
all
we
want
to
slater
was
the
assistant
manager
of
the
clermont
and
one
of
george
s
oldest
friends
then
hurry
said
i
i
am
being
crushed
george
did
hurry
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
before
the
rear
entrance
of
the
great
hotel
there
was
a
mob
gathered
here
also
but
it
was
neither
so
large
nor
so
rough
as
the
one
on
broadway
yet
i
doubt
if
we
should
have
been
able
to
work
our
way
through
it
if
slater
had
not
at
that
very
instant
shown
himself
in
the
doorway
in
company
with
an
officer
to
whom
he
was
giving
some
final
instructions
george
caught
his
eye
as
soon
as
he
was
through
with
the
man
and
ventured
on
what
i
thought
a
rather
uncalled
for
plea
let
us
in
slater
he
begged
my
wife
feels
a
little
faint
she
has
been
knocked
about
so
by
the
the
manager
glanced
at
my
face
and
shouted
to
the
people
around
us
to
make
room
i
felt
myself
lifted
up
and
that
is
all
i
remember
of
this
part
of
our
adventure
for
affected
more
than
i
realised
by
the
excitement
of
the
event
i
no
sooner
saw
the
way
cleared
for
our
entrance
than
i
made
good
my
husband
s
words
by
fainting
away
in
earnest
when
i
came
to
it
was
suddenly
and
with
perfect
recognition
of
my
surroundings
the
small
reception
room
to
which
i
had
been
taken
was
one
i
had
often
visited
and
its
familiar
features
did
not
hold
my
attention
for
a
moment
what
i
did
see
and
welcome
was
my
husband
s
face
bending
close
over
me
and
to
him
i
spoke
first
my
words
must
have
sounded
oddly
to
those
about
have
they
told
you
anything
about
it
i
asked
did
he
a
quick
pressure
on
my
arm
silenced
me
and
then
i
noticed
that
we
were
not
alone
two
or
three
ladies
stood
near
watching
me
and
one
had
evidently
been
using
some
restorative
for
she
held
a
small
vinaigrette
in
her
hand
to
this
lady
george
made
haste
to
introduce
me
and
from
her
i
presently
learned
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
in
the
hotel
it
was
of
a
somewhat
different
nature
from
what
i
expected
and
during
the
recital
i
could
not
prevent
myself
from
casting
furtive
and
inquiring
glances
at
george
edith
the
daughter
of
moses
challoner
had
fallen
suddenly
dead
on
the
floor
of
the
mezzanine
she
was
not
known
to
have
been
in
poor
health
still
less
in
danger
of
a
fatal
attack
and
the
shock
was
consequently
great
to
her
friends
several
of
whom
were
in
the
building
indeed
it
was
likely
to
prove
a
shock
to
the
whole
community
for
she
had
great
claims
to
general
admiration
and
her
death
must
be
regarded
as
a
calamity
to
persons
in
all
stations
of
life
i
realised
this
myself
for
i
had
heard
much
of
the
young
lady
s
private
virtues
as
well
as
of
her
great
beauty
and
distinguished
manner
a
heavy
loss
indeed
but
was
she
alone
when
she
fell
i
asked
virtually
alone
some
persons
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
reading
at
the
big
round
table
they
did
not
even
hear
her
fall
they
say
that
the
band
was
playing
unusually
loud
in
the
musicians
are
you
feeling
quite
well
now
quite
myself
i
gratefully
replied
as
i
rose
slowly
from
the
sofa
then
as
my
kind
informer
stepped
aside
i
turned
to
george
with
the
proposal
we
should
go
now
he
seemed
as
anxious
as
myself
to
leave
and
together
we
moved
towards
the
door
while
the
hum
of
excited
comment
which
the
intrusion
of
a
fainting
woman
had
undoubtedly
interrupted
recommenced
behind
us
till
the
whole
room
buzzed
in
the
hall
we
encountered
slater
whom
i
have
before
mentioned
he
was
trying
to
maintain
order
while
himself
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
seeing
us
he
could
not
refrain
from
whispering
a
few
words
into
my
husband
s
ear
the
doctor
has
just
gone
up
her
doctor
i
mean
he
s
simply
dumbfounded
says
that
she
was
the
healthiest
woman
in
new
york
yesterday
i
think
don
t
mention
it
that
he
suspects
something
quite
different
from
heart
what
do
you
mean
asked
george
following
the
assistant
manager
down
the
broad
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
office
then
as
i
pressed
up
close
to
slater
s
other
side
she
was
by
herself
wasn
t
she
in
the
half
floor
above
yes
and
had
been
writing
a
letter
she
fell
with
it
still
in
her
have
they
carried
her
to
her
room
i
eagerly
inquired
glancing
fearfully
up
at
the
large
openings
overlooking
us
from
the
place
where
she
had
fallen
not
yet
hammond
insists
upon
waiting
for
the
hammond
was
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
she
is
lying
on
one
of
the
big
couches
near
which
she
fell
if
you
like
i
can
give
you
a
glimpse
of
her
she
looks
beautiful
it
s
terrible
to
think
that
she
is
i
don
t
know
why
we
consented
we
were
under
a
spell
i
think
at
all
events
we
accepted
his
offer
and
followed
him
up
a
narrow
staircase
open
to
very
few
that
night
at
the
top
he
turned
upon
us
with
a
warning
gesture
which
i
hardly
think
we
needed
and
led
us
down
a
narrow
hall
flanked
by
openings
corresponding
to
those
we
had
noted
from
below
at
the
furthest
one
he
paused
and
beckoning
us
to
his
side
pointed
across
the
lobby
into
the
large
which
occupied
the
better
part
of
the
mezzanine
floor
we
saw
people
standing
in
various
attitudes
of
grief
and
dismay
about
a
couch
one
end
of
which
only
was
visible
to
us
at
the
moment
the
doctor
had
just
joined
them
and
every
head
was
turned
towards
him
and
every
body
bent
forward
in
anxious
expectation
i
remember
the
face
of
one
grey
haired
old
man
i
shall
never
forget
it
he
was
probably
her
father
later
i
knew
him
to
be
so
her
face
even
her
form
was
entirely
hidden
from
us
but
as
we
watched
i
have
often
thought
with
what
heartless
curiosity
a
sudden
movement
took
place
in
the
whole
group
and
for
one
instant
a
startling
picture
presented
itself
to
our
gaze
miss
challoner
was
stretched
out
upon
the
couch
she
was
dressed
as
she
came
from
dinner
in
a
gown
of
satin
relieved
at
the
breast
by
a
large
bouquet
of
scarlet
poinsettias
i
mention
this
adornment
because
it
was
what
first
met
and
drew
our
eyes
and
the
eyes
of
every
one
about
her
though
the
face
now
quite
revealed
would
seem
to
have
the
greater
attraction
but
the
cause
was
evident
and
one
not
to
be
resisted
the
doctor
was
pointing
at
these
poinsettias
in
horror
and
with
awful
meaning
and
though
we
could
not
hear
his
words
we
knew
almost
instinctively
both
from
his
attitude
and
the
cries
which
burst
from
the
lips
of
those
about
him
that
something
more
than
broken
petals
and
disordered
laces
had
met
his
eyes
that
blood
was
there
slowly
oozing
drops
from
the
heart
which
for
some
reason
had
escaped
all
eyes
till
now
miss
challoner
was
dead
not
from
unsuspected
disease
but
from
the
violent
attack
of
some
murderous
weapon
as
the
realisation
of
this
brought
fresh
panic
and
bowed
the
old
father
s
head
with
emotions
even
more
bitter
than
those
of
grief
i
turned
a
questioning
look
up
at
george
s
face
it
was
fixed
with
a
purpose
i
had
no
trouble
in
understanding
ii
i
know
the
man
yet
he
made
no
effort
to
detain
slater
when
that
gentleman
under
this
renewed
excitement
hastily
left
us
he
was
not
the
man
to
rush
into
anything
impulsively
and
not
even
the
presence
of
murder
could
change
his
ways
i
want
to
feel
sure
of
myself
he
explained
can
you
bear
the
strain
of
waiting
around
a
little
longer
laura
i
mustn
t
forget
that
you
fainted
just
yes
i
can
bear
it
much
better
than
i
could
bear
going
to
adela
s
in
my
present
state
of
mind
don
t
you
think
the
man
we
saw
had
something
to
do
with
this
don
t
you
believe
hush
let
us
listen
rather
than
talk
what
are
they
saying
over
there
can
you
hear
no
and
i
can
not
bear
to
look
yet
i
don
t
want
to
go
away
it
s
all
so
it
s
devilish
such
a
beautiful
girl
laura
i
must
leave
you
for
a
moment
do
you
mind
no
no
yet
i
did
mind
but
he
was
gone
before
i
could
take
back
my
word
alone
i
felt
the
tragedy
much
more
than
when
he
was
with
me
instead
of
watching
as
i
had
hitherto
done
every
movement
in
the
room
opposite
i
drew
back
against
the
wall
and
hid
my
eyes
waiting
feverishly
for
george
s
return
he
came
when
he
did
come
in
some
haste
and
with
certain
marks
of
increased
agitation
laura
said
he
slater
says
that
we
may
possibly
be
wanted
and
proposes
that
we
stay
here
all
night
i
have
telephoned
adela
and
have
made
it
all
right
at
home
will
you
come
to
your
room
this
is
no
place
for
nothing
could
have
pleased
me
better
to
be
near
and
yet
not
the
direct
observer
of
proceedings
in
which
we
took
so
secret
an
interest
i
showed
my
gratitude
by
following
george
immediately
but
i
could
not
go
without
casting
another
glance
at
the
tragic
scene
i
was
leaving
a
stir
was
perceptible
there
and
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
its
cause
a
tall
angular
gentleman
was
approaching
from
the
direction
of
the
musicians
gallery
and
from
the
manner
of
all
present
as
well
as
from
the
whispered
comment
of
my
husband
i
recognised
in
him
the
special
official
for
whom
all
had
been
waiting
are
you
going
to
tell
him
was
my
question
to
george
as
we
made
our
way
down
to
the
lobby
that
depends
first
i
am
going
to
see
you
settled
in
a
room
quite
remote
from
this
i
shall
not
like
i
know
my
dear
but
it
is
i
could
not
gainsay
this
nevertheless
after
the
first
few
minutes
of
relief
i
found
it
very
lonesome
upstairs
the
pictures
which
crowded
upon
me
of
the
various
groups
of
excited
and
wildly
gesticulating
men
and
women
through
which
we
had
passed
on
our
way
up
mingled
themselves
with
the
solemn
horror
of
the
scene
in
the
with
its
fleeting
vision
of
youth
and
beauty
lying
pulseless
in
sudden
death
i
could
not
escape
the
one
without
feeling
the
immediate
impress
of
the
other
and
if
by
chance
they
both
yielded
for
an
instant
to
that
earlier
scene
of
a
desolate
street
with
its
solitary
lamp
shining
down
on
the
crouched
figure
of
a
man
washing
his
shaking
hands
in
a
drift
of
freshly
fallen
snow
they
immediately
rushed
back
with
a
force
and
clearness
all
the
greater
for
the
momentary
lapse
i
was
still
struggling
with
these
fancies
when
the
door
opened
and
george
came
in
there
was
news
in
his
face
as
i
rushed
to
meet
him
tell
me
tell
i
begged
he
tried
to
smile
at
my
eagerness
but
the
attempt
was
ghastly
i
ve
been
listening
and
looking
said
he
and
this
is
all
i
have
learned
miss
challoner
died
not
from
a
stroke
or
from
disease
of
any
kind
but
from
a
wound
reaching
the
heart
no
one
saw
the
attack
or
even
the
approach
or
departure
of
the
person
inflicting
this
wound
if
she
was
killed
by
a
it
was
at
a
distance
and
almost
over
the
heads
of
the
persons
sitting
at
the
table
we
saw
there
but
the
doctors
shake
their
heads
at
the
word
though
they
refuse
to
explain
themselves
or
to
express
any
opinion
till
the
wound
has
been
probed
this
they
are
going
to
do
at
once
and
when
that
question
is
decided
i
may
feel
it
my
duty
to
speak
and
may
ask
you
to
support
my
i
will
tell
what
i
saw
said
i
very
good
that
is
all
that
will
be
required
we
are
strangers
to
the
parties
concerned
and
only
speak
from
a
sense
of
justice
it
may
be
that
our
story
will
make
no
impression
and
that
we
shall
be
dismissed
with
but
few
thanks
but
that
is
nothing
to
us
if
the
woman
has
been
murdered
he
is
the
murderer
with
such
a
conviction
in
my
mind
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
my
we
can
never
make
them
understand
how
he
no
i
don
t
expect
or
his
manner
as
he
nor
that
we
can
only
describe
what
we
saw
him
that
s
oh
what
an
adventure
for
quiet
people
like
us
george
i
don
t
believe
he
shot
he
must
but
they
would
have
seen
have
heard
the
people
around
i
so
they
say
but
i
have
a
theory
but
no
matter
about
that
now
i
m
going
down
again
to
see
how
things
have
progressed
i
ll
be
back
for
you
later
only
be
be
ready
i
almost
laughed
a
hysterical
laugh
of
course
when
i
recalled
the
injunction
be
ready
this
lonely
sitting
by
myself
with
nothing
to
do
but
think
was
a
fine
preparation
for
a
sudden
appearance
before
those
men
some
of
them
no
doubt
but
that
s
enough
about
myself
i
m
not
the
heroine
of
this
story
in
a
half
hour
or
an
hour
i
never
knew
which
george
reappeared
only
to
tell
me
that
no
conclusions
had
as
yet
been
reached
an
element
of
great
mystery
involved
the
whole
affair
and
the
most
astute
detectives
on
the
force
had
been
sent
for
her
father
who
had
been
her
constant
companion
all
winter
had
not
the
least
suggestion
to
offer
in
way
of
its
solution
so
far
as
he
knew
and
he
believed
himself
to
have
been
in
perfect
accord
with
his
daughter
she
had
injured
no
one
she
had
just
lived
the
even
happy
and
useful
life
of
a
young
woman
of
means
who
sees
duties
beyond
those
of
her
own
household
and
immediate
surroundings
if
in
the
fulfillment
of
those
duties
she
had
encountered
any
obstacle
to
content
he
did
not
know
it
nor
could
he
mention
a
friend
of
hers
he
would
even
say
lovers
since
that
was
what
he
meant
who
to
his
knowledge
could
be
accused
of
harbouring
any
such
passion
of
revenge
as
was
manifested
in
this
secret
and
diabolical
attack
they
were
all
gentlemen
and
respected
her
as
heartily
as
they
appeared
to
admire
her
to
no
living
being
man
or
woman
could
he
point
as
possessing
any
motive
for
such
a
deed
she
had
been
the
victim
of
some
mistake
his
lovely
and
ever
kindly
disposed
daughter
and
while
the
loss
was
irreparable
he
would
never
make
it
unendurable
by
thinking
otherwise
such
was
the
father
s
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
and
i
own
that
it
made
our
duty
a
trifle
hard
but
george
s
mind
when
once
made
up
was
persistent
to
the
point
of
obstinacy
and
while
he
was
yet
talking
he
led
me
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
hall
to
the
elevator
mr
slater
knows
we
have
something
to
say
and
will
manage
the
interview
before
us
in
the
very
best
manner
he
confided
to
me
now
with
an
encouraging
air
we
are
to
go
to
the
blue
reception
room
on
the
parlour
i
nodded
and
nothing
more
was
said
till
we
entered
the
place
mentioned
here
we
came
upon
several
gentlemen
standing
about
of
a
more
or
less
professional
appearance
this
was
not
very
agreeable
to
one
of
my
retiring
disposition
but
a
look
from
george
brought
back
my
courage
and
i
found
myself
waiting
rather
anxiously
for
the
questions
i
expected
to
hear
put
slater
was
there
according
to
his
promise
and
after
introducing
us
briefly
stated
that
we
had
some
evidence
to
give
regarding
the
terrible
occurrence
which
had
just
taken
place
in
the
house
george
bowed
and
the
chief
spokesman
i
am
sure
he
was
a
of
some
kind
asked
him
to
tell
what
it
was
george
drew
himself
up
george
is
not
one
of
your
tall
men
but
he
makes
a
very
good
appearance
at
times
then
he
seemed
suddenly
to
collapse
the
sight
of
their
expectation
made
him
feel
how
flat
and
childish
his
story
would
sound
i
who
had
shared
his
adventure
understood
his
embarrassment
but
the
others
were
evidently
at
a
loss
to
do
so
for
they
glanced
askance
at
each
other
as
he
hesitated
and
only
looked
back
when
i
ventured
to
say
it
s
the
peculiarity
of
the
occurrence
which
affects
my
husband
the
thing
we
saw
may
mean
let
us
hear
what
it
was
and
we
will
then
my
husband
spoke
up
and
related
our
little
experience
if
it
did
not
create
a
sensation
it
was
because
these
men
were
well
accustomed
to
surprises
of
all
kinds
washed
his
hands
a
gentleman
out
there
in
the
snow
just
after
the
alarm
was
raised
here
repeated
one
and
you
saw
him
come
out
of
this
house
another
put
in
yes
sir
we
noticed
him
can
you
describe
him
it
was
slater
who
put
this
question
he
had
less
control
over
himself
and
considerable
eagerness
could
be
heard
in
his
voice
he
was
a
very
man
unusually
tall
and
unusually
striking
both
in
his
dress
and
appearance
what
i
could
see
of
his
face
was
bare
of
beard
and
very
expressive
he
walked
with
the
swing
of
an
athlete
and
only
looked
mean
and
small
when
he
was
stooping
and
dabbling
in
the
his
clothes
describe
his
there
was
an
odd
sound
in
slater
s
voice
he
wore
a
silk
hat
and
there
was
fur
on
his
overcoat
i
think
the
fur
was
slater
stepped
back
then
moved
forward
again
with
a
determined
air
i
know
the
man
said
he
iii
the
man
you
know
the
man
i
do
or
rather
i
know
a
man
who
answers
to
this
description
he
comes
here
once
in
a
while
i
do
not
know
whether
or
not
he
was
in
the
building
but
clausen
can
tell
you
no
one
escapes
clausen
s
his
brotherson
a
very
uncommon
person
in
many
respects
quite
capable
of
such
an
eccentricity
but
incapable
i
should
say
of
crime
he
s
a
gifted
talker
and
so
well
read
that
he
can
hold
one
s
attention
for
hours
of
his
tastes
i
can
only
say
that
they
appear
to
be
mainly
scientific
but
he
is
not
averse
to
society
and
is
always
very
well
a
taste
for
science
and
for
fine
clothing
do
not
often
go
this
man
is
an
exception
to
all
rules
the
one
i
m
speaking
of
i
mean
i
don
t
say
that
he
s
the
fellow
seen
pottering
in
the
call
up
the
manager
stepped
to
the
telephone
meanwhile
george
had
advanced
to
speak
to
a
man
who
had
beckoned
to
him
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
with
whom
in
another
moment
i
saw
him
step
out
thus
deserted
i
sank
into
a
chair
near
one
of
the
windows
never
had
i
felt
more
uncomfortable
to
attribute
guilt
to
a
totally
unknown
person
a
person
who
is
little
more
to
you
than
a
shadowy
silhouette
against
a
background
of
snow
is
easy
enough
and
not
very
disturbing
to
the
conscience
but
to
hear
that
person
named
given
positive
attributes
lifted
from
the
indefinite
into
a
living
breathing
actuality
with
a
man
s
hopes
purposes
and
responsibilities
is
an
entirely
different
proposition
this
brotherson
might
be
the
most
innocent
person
alive
and
if
so
what
had
we
done
nothing
to
congratulate
ourselves
upon
certainly
and
george
was
not
present
to
comfort
and
encourage
me
he
was
where
was
he
the
man
who
had
carried
him
off
was
the
youngest
in
the
group
what
had
he
wanted
of
george
those
who
remained
showed
no
interest
in
the
matter
they
had
enough
to
say
among
themselves
but
i
was
interested
naturally
so
and
in
my
uneasiness
glanced
restlessly
from
the
window
the
shade
of
which
was
up
the
outlook
was
a
very
peaceful
one
this
room
faced
a
side
street
and
as
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
whitened
pavements
i
received
an
answer
to
one
and
that
the
most
anxious
of
my
queries
this
was
the
street
into
which
we
had
turned
in
the
wake
of
the
handsome
stranger
they
were
trying
at
this
very
moment
to
identify
with
brotherson
george
had
evidently
been
asked
to
point
out
the
exact
spot
where
the
man
had
stopped
for
i
could
see
from
my
vantage
point
two
figures
bending
near
the
kerb
and
even
pawing
at
the
snow
which
lay
there
it
gave
me
a
slight
turn
when
one
of
them
i
do
not
think
it
was
george
began
to
rub
his
hands
together
in
much
the
way
the
unknown
gentleman
had
done
and
in
my
excitement
i
probably
uttered
some
sort
of
an
ejaculation
for
i
was
suddenly
conscious
of
a
silence
in
the
room
and
when
i
turned
saw
all
the
men
about
me
looking
my
way
i
attempted
to
smile
but
instead
shuddered
painfully
as
i
raised
my
hand
and
pointed
down
at
the
street
they
are
imitating
the
man
i
cried
my
husband
and
and
the
person
he
went
out
with
it
looked
dreadful
to
me
that
is
one
of
the
gentlemen
immediately
said
some
kind
words
to
me
and
another
smiled
in
a
very
encouraging
way
but
their
attention
was
soon
diverted
and
so
was
mine
by
the
entrance
of
a
man
in
who
was
immediately
addressed
as
clausen
i
knew
his
face
he
was
one
of
the
doorkeepers
the
oldest
employee
about
the
hotel
and
the
one
best
liked
i
had
often
exchanged
words
with
him
myself
slater
at
once
put
his
question
has
brotherson
passed
your
door
at
any
time
mr
brotherson
i
don
t
remember
really
i
don
t
was
the
unexpected
reply
it
s
not
often
i
forget
but
so
many
people
came
rushing
in
during
those
few
minutes
and
all
so
excited
before
the
excitement
clausen
a
little
while
before
possibly
just
oh
now
i
recall
him
yes
brotherson
went
out
of
my
door
not
many
minutes
before
the
cry
upstairs
i
forgot
because
i
had
stepped
back
from
the
door
to
hand
a
lady
the
muff
she
had
dropped
and
it
was
at
that
minute
he
went
out
i
just
got
a
glimpse
of
his
back
as
he
passed
into
the
but
you
are
sure
of
that
back
i
don
t
know
another
like
it
when
he
wears
that
big
coat
of
his
but
jim
can
tell
you
sir
he
was
in
the
cafe
up
to
that
minute
and
that
s
where
brotherson
usually
goes
very
well
send
up
jim
tell
him
i
have
some
orders
to
give
the
old
man
bowed
and
went
out
meanwhile
slater
had
exchanged
some
words
with
the
two
officials
and
now
approached
me
with
an
expression
of
extreme
consideration
they
were
about
to
excuse
me
from
further
participation
in
this
informal
inquiry
this
i
saw
before
he
spoke
of
course
they
were
right
but
i
should
greatly
have
preferred
to
stay
where
i
was
till
george
came
back
however
i
met
him
for
an
instant
in
the
hall
before
i
took
the
elevator
and
later
i
heard
in
a
way
what
jim
and
some
others
about
the
house
had
to
say
of
brotherson
he
was
an
habitue
of
the
hotel
to
the
extent
of
dining
once
or
twice
a
week
in
the
cafe
and
smoking
afterwards
in
the
public
lobby
when
he
was
in
the
mood
for
talk
he
would
draw
an
group
about
him
but
at
other
times
he
would
be
seen
sitting
quite
alone
and
morosely
indifferent
to
all
who
approached
him
there
was
no
mystery
about
his
business
he
was
an
inventor
with
one
or
two
valuable
patents
already
on
the
market
but
this
was
not
his
only
interest
he
was
an
all
round
sort
of
man
moody
but
brilliant
in
many
ways
a
character
which
at
once
attracted
and
repelled
odd
in
that
he
seemed
to
set
little
store
by
his
good
looks
yet
was
most
careful
to
dress
himself
in
a
way
to
show
them
off
to
advantage
if
he
had
means
beyond
the
ordinary
no
one
knew
it
nor
could
any
man
say
that
he
had
not
on
all
personal
matters
he
was
very
though
he
would
talk
about
other
men
s
riches
in
a
way
to
show
that
he
cherished
some
very
extreme
views
this
was
all
which
could
be
learned
about
him
and
at
so
late
an
hour
i
was
greatly
interested
of
course
and
had
plenty
to
think
of
till
i
saw
george
again
and
learned
the
result
of
the
latest
investigations
miss
challoner
had
been
shot
not
stabbed
no
other
deduction
was
possible
from
such
facts
as
were
now
known
though
the
physicians
had
not
yet
handed
in
their
report
or
even
intimated
what
that
report
would
be
no
assailant
could
have
approached
or
left
her
without
attracting
the
notice
of
some
one
if
not
all
of
the
persons
seated
at
a
table
in
the
same
room
she
could
only
have
been
reached
by
a
bullet
sent
from
a
point
near
the
head
of
a
small
winding
staircase
connecting
the
mezzanine
floor
with
a
adjacent
to
the
front
door
this
has
already
been
insisted
on
as
you
will
remember
and
if
you
will
glance
at
the
diagram
which
george
hastily
scrawled
for
me
you
will
see
why
a
as
well
as
are
half
circular
openings
into
the
office
lobby
are
windows
giving
upon
broadway
and
the
party
wall
necessarily
unbroken
by
window
door
or
any
other
opening
where

staircase
x
f
musician
s
gallery
dining
room
level
with
lobby
it
follows
then
that
the
only
possible
means
of
approach
to
this
room
lies
through
the
archway
or
from
the
elevator
door
but
the
elevator
made
no
stop
at
the
mezzanine
on
or
near
the
time
of
the
attack
upon
miss
challoner
nor
did
any
one
leave
the
table
or
pass
by
it
in
either
direction
till
after
the
alarm
given
by
her
fall
but
a
bullet
calls
for
no
approach
a
man
at
might
raise
and
fire
his
pistol
without
attracting
any
attention
to
himself
the
music
which
all
acknowledge
was
at
its
full
climax
at
this
moment
would
drown
the
noise
of
the
explosion
and
the
staircase
out
of
view
of
all
but
the
victim
afford
the
same
means
of
immediate
escape
which
it
must
have
given
of
secret
and
unseen
approach
the
into
which
it
descended
communicated
with
the
lobby
very
near
the
main
entrance
and
if
brotherson
were
the
man
his
sudden
appearance
there
would
thus
be
accounted
for
to
be
sure
this
gentleman
had
not
been
noticed
in
the
coatroom
by
the
man
then
in
charge
but
if
the
latter
had
been
engaged
at
that
instant
as
he
often
was
in
hanging
up
or
taking
down
a
coat
from
the
rack
a
person
might
easily
pass
by
him
and
disappear
into
the
lobby
without
attracting
his
attention
so
many
people
passed
that
way
from
the
beyond
and
so
many
of
these
were
tall
and
it
began
to
look
bad
for
this
man
if
indeed
he
were
the
one
we
had
seen
under
the
and
as
george
and
i
reviewed
the
situation
we
felt
our
position
to
be
serious
enough
for
us
severally
to
set
down
our
impressions
of
this
man
before
we
lost
our
first
vivid
idea
i
do
not
know
what
george
wrote
for
he
sealed
his
words
up
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
writing
but
this
is
what
i
put
on
paper
while
my
memory
was
still
fresh
and
my
excitement
unabated
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
of
powerful
intellect
and
determined
will
who
shudders
while
he
triumphs
who
outwardly
washes
his
hands
of
a
deed
over
which
he
inwardly
gloats
this
was
when
he
first
rose
from
the
snow
afterwards
he
had
a
moment
of
fear
plain
human
everyday
fear
but
this
was
evanescent
before
he
had
turned
to
go
he
showed
the
of
one
who
feels
himself
so
secure
or
is
so
with
himself
that
he
is
no
longer
conscious
of
other
emotions
poor
fellow
i
commented
aloud
as
i
folded
up
these
words
he
reckoned
without
you
george
by
he
will
be
in
the
hands
of
the
poor
fellow
he
repeated
better
say
poor
miss
challoner
they
tell
me
she
was
one
of
those
perfect
women
who
reconcile
even
the
pessimist
to
humanity
and
the
age
we
live
in
why
any
one
should
want
to
kill
her
is
a
mystery
but
why
this
man
should
there
no
one
professes
to
explain
it
they
simply
go
by
the
facts
surely
must
bring
strange
and
with
this
sentence
ringing
in
my
mind
i
lay
down
and
endeavoured
to
sleep
but
it
was
not
till
very
late
that
rest
came
the
noise
of
passing
feet
though
muffled
beyond
their
wont
roused
me
in
spite
of
myself
these
footsteps
might
be
those
of
some
late
arrival
or
they
might
be
those
of
some
wary
detective
intent
on
business
far
removed
from
the
usual
routine
of
life
in
this
great
hotel
i
recalled
the
glimpse
i
had
had
of
the
in
the
early
evening
and
imagined
it
as
it
was
with
miss
challoner
s
body
removed
and
the
incongruous
flitting
of
strange
and
busy
figures
across
its
fatal
floors
measuring
distances
and
peering
into
corners
while
hundreds
slept
above
and
about
them
in
undisturbed
repose
then
i
thought
of
him
the
suspected
and
possibly
guilty
one
in
visions
over
which
i
had
little
if
any
control
i
saw
him
in
all
the
restlessness
of
a
slowly
dying
down
excitement
the
surroundings
strange
and
unknown
to
me
the
figure
not
seeking
for
quiet
facing
the
past
facing
the
future
knowing
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
what
it
was
for
crime
and
remorse
to
murder
sleep
i
could
not
think
of
him
as
lying
still
slumbering
like
the
rest
of
mankind
in
the
hope
and
expectation
of
a
busy
morrow
crime
perpetrated
looms
so
large
in
the
soul
and
this
man
had
a
soul
as
big
as
his
body
of
that
i
was
assured
that
its
instincts
were
cruel
and
inherently
evil
did
not
lessen
its
capacity
for
suffering
and
he
was
suffering
now
i
could
not
doubt
it
remembering
the
lovely
face
and
fragrant
memory
of
the
noble
woman
he
had
under
some
unknown
impulse
sent
to
an
unmerited
doom
at
last
i
slept
but
it
was
only
to
rouse
again
with
the
same
quick
realisation
of
my
surroundings
which
i
had
experienced
on
my
recovery
from
my
fainting
fit
of
hours
before
someone
had
stopped
at
our
door
before
hurrying
by
down
the
hall
who
was
that
someone
i
rose
on
my
elbow
and
endeavoured
to
peer
through
the
dark
of
course
i
could
see
nothing
but
when
i
woke
a
second
time
there
was
enough
light
in
the
room
early
as
it
undoubtedly
was
for
me
to
detect
a
letter
lying
on
the
carpet
just
inside
the
door
instantly
i
was
on
my
feet
catching
the
letter
up
i
carried
it
to
the
window
our
two
names
were
on
it
and
george
anderson
the
writing
slater
s
i
glanced
over
at
george
he
was
sleeping
peacefully
it
was
too
early
to
wake
him
but
i
could
not
lay
that
letter
down
unread
was
not
my
name
on
it
tearing
it
open
i
devoured
its
contents
the
exclamation
i
made
on
reading
it
waking
george
the
writing
was
in
slater
s
hand
and
the
words
were
i
must
request
at
the
instance
of
coroner
heath
and
such
of
the
police
as
listened
to
your
adventure
that
you
make
no
further
mention
of
what
you
saw
in
the
street
under
our
windows
last
night
the
doctors
find
no
bullet
in
the
wound
this
clears
iv
sweet
little
miss
clarke
when
we
took
our
seats
at
the
it
was
with
the
feeling
of
being
no
longer
looked
upon
as
connected
in
any
way
with
this
case
yet
our
interest
in
it
was
if
anything
increased
and
when
i
saw
george
casting
furtive
glances
at
a
certain
table
behind
me
i
leaned
over
and
asked
him
the
reason
being
sure
that
the
people
whose
faces
i
saw
reflected
in
the
mirror
directly
before
us
had
something
to
do
with
the
great
matter
then
engrossing
us
his
answer
conveyed
the
somewhat
exciting
information
that
the
four
persons
seated
in
my
rear
were
the
same
four
who
had
been
reading
at
the
round
table
in
the
mezzanine
at
the
time
of
miss
challoner
s
death
instantly
they
absorbed
all
my
attention
though
i
dared
not
give
them
a
direct
look
and
continued
to
observe
them
only
in
the
glass
is
it
one
family
i
asked
yes
and
a
very
respectable
one
transients
of
course
but
very
well
known
in
denver
the
lady
is
not
the
mother
of
the
boys
but
their
aunt
the
boys
belong
to
the
gentleman
who
is
a
their
word
ought
to
be
george
nodded
the
boys
look
enough
if
the
father
does
not
as
for
the
aunt
she
is
sweetness
itself
do
they
still
insist
that
miss
challoner
was
the
only
person
in
the
room
with
them
at
this
time
they
did
last
night
i
don
t
know
how
they
will
meet
this
statement
of
the
doctor
george
he
leaned
nearer
have
you
ever
thought
that
she
might
have
been
a
suicide
that
she
stabbed
herself
no
for
in
that
case
a
weapon
would
have
been
and
are
you
sure
that
none
was
positive
such
a
fact
could
not
have
been
kept
quiet
if
a
weapon
had
been
picked
up
there
would
be
no
mystery
and
no
necessity
for
further
police
and
the
detectives
are
still
here
i
just
saw
george
again
his
head
came
nearer
have
they
searched
the
lobby
i
believe
she
had
a
laura
i
know
it
sounds
foolish
but
the
alternative
is
so
improbable
a
family
like
that
can
not
be
leagued
together
in
a
conspiracy
to
hide
the
truth
concerning
a
matter
so
serious
to
be
sure
they
may
all
be
or
so
little
given
to
observation
that
they
didn
t
see
what
passed
before
their
eyes
the
boys
look
enough
but
who
can
tell
i
would
sooner
believe
that
i
stopped
short
so
suddenly
that
george
looked
startled
my
attention
had
been
caught
by
something
new
i
saw
in
the
mirror
upon
which
my
attention
was
fixed
a
man
was
looking
in
from
the
corridor
behind
at
the
four
persons
we
were
just
discussing
he
was
watching
them
intently
and
i
thought
i
knew
his
face
what
kind
of
a
looking
person
was
the
man
who
took
you
outside
last
night
i
inquired
of
george
with
my
eyes
still
on
this
furtive
watcher
a
fellow
to
make
you
laugh
a
perfect
character
laura
hideously
homely
but
agreeable
enough
i
took
quite
a
fancy
to
him
why
i
am
looking
at
him
very
likely
he
s
deep
in
this
affair
just
an
everyday
detective
but
ambitious
i
suppose
and
quite
alive
to
the
importance
of
being
he
is
watching
those
people
no
he
isn
t
how
quickly
he
disappeared
yes
he
s
mercurial
in
all
his
movements
laura
we
must
get
out
of
this
there
happens
to
be
something
else
in
the
world
for
me
to
do
than
to
sit
around
and
follow
up
murder
but
we
began
to
doubt
if
others
agreed
with
him
when
on
passing
out
we
were
stopped
in
the
lobby
by
this
same
detective
who
had
something
to
say
to
george
and
drew
him
quickly
aside
what
does
he
want
i
asked
as
soon
as
george
had
returned
to
my
side
he
wants
me
to
stand
ready
to
obey
any
summons
the
police
may
send
then
they
still
suspect
brotherson
they
my
head
rose
a
trifle
as
i
glanced
up
at
george
then
we
are
not
altogether
out
of
it
i
emphasised
complacently
he
smiled
which
hardly
seemed
apropos
why
does
george
sometimes
smile
when
i
am
in
my
most
serious
moods
as
we
stepped
out
of
the
hotel
george
gave
my
arm
a
quiet
pinch
which
served
to
direct
my
attention
to
an
elderly
gentleman
who
was
just
alighting
from
a
taxicab
at
the
kerb
he
moved
heavily
and
with
some
appearance
of
pain
but
from
the
crowd
collected
on
the
sidewalk
many
of
whom
nudged
each
other
as
he
passed
he
was
evidently
a
person
of
some
importance
and
as
he
disappeared
within
the
hotel
entrance
i
asked
george
who
this
old
gentleman
could
be
he
appeared
to
know
for
he
told
me
at
once
that
he
was
detective
gryce
a
man
who
had
grown
old
in
solving
just
such
baffling
problems
as
these
he
gave
up
work
some
time
ago
i
have
been
told
my
husband
went
on
but
evidently
a
great
case
still
has
its
allurement
for
him
the
trail
here
must
be
a
very
blind
one
for
them
to
call
him
in
i
wish
we
had
not
left
so
soon
it
would
have
been
quite
an
experience
to
see
him
at
i
doubt
if
you
would
have
been
given
the
opportunity
i
noticed
that
we
were
slightly
de
trop
towards
the
i
wouldn
t
have
minded
that
not
on
my
own
account
that
is
it
might
not
have
been
pleasant
for
you
however
the
office
is
waiting
come
let
me
put
you
on
the
that
night
i
bided
his
coming
with
an
impatience
i
could
not
control
he
was
late
of
course
but
when
he
did
appear
i
almost
forgot
our
usual
greeting
in
my
hurry
to
ask
him
if
he
had
seen
the
evening
papers
no
he
grumbled
as
he
hung
up
his
overcoat
been
pushed
about
all
day
no
time
for
then
let
me
tell
you
but
he
would
have
dinner
first
however
a
little
later
we
had
a
comfortable
chat
gryce
had
made
a
discovery
and
the
papers
were
full
of
it
it
was
one
which
gave
me
a
small
triumph
over
george
the
suggestion
he
had
laughed
at
was
not
so
entirely
foolish
as
he
had
been
pleased
to
consider
it
but
let
me
tell
the
story
of
that
day
without
any
further
reference
to
myself
the
opinion
had
become
quite
general
with
those
best
acquainted
with
the
details
of
this
affair
that
the
mystery
was
one
of
those
abnormal
ones
for
which
no
solution
would
ever
be
found
when
the
aged
detective
showed
himself
in
the
building
and
was
taken
to
the
room
where
an
inspector
of
police
awaited
him
their
greeting
was
cordial
and
the
lines
on
the
latter
s
face
relaxed
a
little
as
he
met
the
still
bright
eye
of
the
man
upon
whose
instinct
and
judgment
so
much
reliance
had
always
been
placed
this
is
very
good
of
you
he
began
glancing
down
at
the
aged
detective
s
bundled
up
legs
and
gently
pushing
a
chair
towards
him
i
know
that
it
was
a
great
deal
to
ask
but
we
re
at
our
wits
end
and
so
i
telephoned
it
s
the
most
inexplicable
there
you
have
heard
that
phrase
before
but
clews
there
are
absolutely
none
that
is
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
perhaps
you
can
at
least
that
is
what
we
hope
i
ve
known
you
more
than
once
to
succeed
where
others
have
the
elderly
man
thus
addressed
glanced
down
at
his
legs
now
propped
up
on
a
stool
which
someone
had
brought
him
and
smiled
with
the
pathos
of
the
old
who
sees
the
interests
of
a
lifetime
slipping
gradually
away
i
am
not
what
i
was
i
can
no
longer
get
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
to
pick
up
threads
from
the
nap
of
a
rug
or
spy
out
a
spot
of
blood
in
the
crimson
woof
of
a
you
shall
have
sweetwater
here
to
do
the
active
work
for
you
what
we
want
of
you
is
the
directing
mind
the
infallible
instinct
it
s
a
case
in
a
thousand
gryce
we
ve
never
had
anything
just
like
it
you
ve
never
had
anything
at
all
like
it
it
will
make
you
young
the
old
man
s
eyes
shot
fire
and
unconsciously
one
foot
slipped
to
the
floor
then
he
bethought
himself
and
painfully
lifted
it
back
again
what
are
the
points
what
s
the
difficulty
he
asked
a
woman
has
been
shot
no
not
shot
stabbed
we
thought
she
had
been
shot
for
that
was
intelligible
and
involved
no
impossibilities
but
drs
heath
and
webster
under
the
eye
of
the
challoners
own
physician
have
made
an
examination
of
the
wound
an
official
one
thorough
and
quite
final
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
and
they
declare
that
no
bullet
is
to
be
found
in
the
body
as
the
wound
extends
no
further
than
the
heart
this
settles
one
great
point
at
dr
heath
is
a
reliable
man
and
one
of
our
ablest
yes
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
truth
of
his
report
you
know
the
victim
her
name
i
mean
and
the
character
she
bore
yes
so
much
was
told
me
on
my
way
a
fine
girl
unspoiled
by
riches
and
seeming
independence
happy
too
to
all
appearance
or
we
should
be
more
ready
to
consider
the
possibility
of
suicide
by
stabbing
calls
for
a
weapon
yet
none
has
been
found
i
yet
she
was
killed
that
way
undoubtedly
and
by
a
long
and
very
narrow
blade
larger
than
a
needle
but
not
so
large
as
the
ordinary
stabbed
while
by
herself
or
what
you
may
call
by
herself
she
had
no
companion
near
her
none
if
we
can
believe
the
four
members
of
the
parrish
family
who
were
seated
at
the
other
end
of
the
and
you
do
believe
them
would
a
whole
family
lie
and
needlessly
they
never
knew
the
woman
father
maiden
aunt
and
two
boys
jolly
young
chaps
whom
even
the
horror
of
this
tragedy
perpetrated
as
it
were
under
their
very
nose
can
not
make
serious
for
more
than
a
passing
it
wouldn
t
seem
yet
they
swear
up
and
down
that
nobody
crossed
the
room
towards
miss
so
they
tell
she
fell
just
a
few
feet
from
the
desk
where
she
had
been
writing
no
word
no
cry
just
a
collapse
and
sudden
fall
in
olden
days
they
would
have
said
struck
by
a
bolt
from
heaven
but
it
was
a
bolt
which
drew
blood
not
much
blood
i
hear
but
sufficient
to
end
life
almost
instantly
she
never
looked
up
or
spoke
again
what
do
you
make
of
it
gryce
it
s
a
tough
one
and
i
m
not
ready
to
venture
an
opinion
yet
i
should
like
to
see
the
desk
you
speak
of
and
the
spot
where
she
a
young
fellow
who
had
been
hovering
in
the
background
at
once
stepped
forward
he
was
the
detective
who
had
spoken
to
george
will
you
take
my
arm
sir
gryce
s
whole
face
brightened
this
sweetwater
as
they
called
him
was
i
have
since
understood
one
of
his
proteges
and
more
or
less
of
a
favourite
have
you
had
a
chance
at
this
thing
he
asked
been
over
the
ground
studied
the
affair
carefully
yes
sir
they
were
good
enough
to
allow
very
well
then
you
re
in
a
position
to
pioneer
me
you
ve
seen
it
all
and
won
t
be
in
a
no
i
m
at
the
end
of
my
rope
i
haven
t
an
idea
well
well
that
s
honest
at
all
then
as
he
slowly
rose
with
the
other
s
careful
assistance
there
s
no
crime
without
its
clew
the
thing
is
to
recognise
that
clew
when
seen
but
i
m
in
no
position
to
make
promises
old
days
don
t
return
for
the
nevertheless
he
looked
ten
years
younger
than
when
he
came
in
or
so
thought
those
who
knew
him
the
mezzanine
was
guarded
from
all
visitors
save
such
as
had
official
sanction
consequently
the
two
remained
quite
uninterrupted
while
they
moved
about
the
place
in
quiet
consultation
others
had
preceded
them
had
examined
the
plain
little
desk
and
found
nothing
had
paced
off
the
distances
had
looked
with
longing
and
inquiring
eyes
at
the
elevator
cage
and
the
open
archway
leading
to
the
little
staircase
and
the
musicians
gallery
but
this
was
nothing
to
the
old
detective
the
locale
was
what
he
wanted
and
he
got
it
whether
he
got
anything
else
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
from
his
manner
as
he
finally
sank
into
a
chair
by
one
of
the
openings
and
looked
down
on
the
lobby
below
it
was
full
of
people
coming
and
going
on
all
sorts
of
business
and
presently
he
drew
back
and
leaning
on
sweetwater
s
arm
asked
him
a
few
questions
who
were
the
first
to
rush
in
here
after
the
parrishes
gave
the
alarm
one
or
two
of
the
musicians
from
the
end
of
the
hall
they
had
just
finished
their
programme
and
were
preparing
to
leave
the
gallery
naturally
they
reached
her
good
their
names
mark
sowerby
and
claus
hennerberg
honest
germans
men
who
have
played
here
for
and
who
followed
them
who
came
next
on
the
scene
some
people
from
the
lobby
they
heard
the
disturbance
and
rushed
up
but
not
one
of
these
touched
her
later
her
father
who
did
touch
her
anybody
before
the
father
came
in
yes
miss
clarke
the
lady
with
the
parrishes
she
had
run
towards
miss
challoner
as
soon
as
she
heard
her
fall
and
was
sitting
there
with
the
dead
girl
s
head
in
her
lap
when
the
musicians
showed
i
suppose
she
has
been
carefully
questioned
very
i
should
and
she
speaks
of
no
weapon
no
neither
she
nor
any
one
else
at
that
moment
suspected
murder
or
even
a
violent
death
all
thought
it
a
natural
one
sudden
but
the
result
of
some
secret
father
and
all
but
the
blood
surely
there
must
have
been
some
show
of
blood
they
say
not
no
one
noticed
any
not
till
the
doctor
came
her
doctor
who
was
happily
in
his
office
in
this
very
building
he
saw
the
drops
and
uttered
the
first
suggestion
of
how
long
after
was
this
is
there
any
one
who
has
ventured
to
make
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
minutes
which
elapsed
from
the
time
she
fell
to
the
moment
when
the
doctor
first
raised
the
cry
of
murder
yes
slater
the
assistant
manager
who
was
in
the
lobby
at
the
time
says
that
ten
minutes
at
least
must
have
ten
minutes
and
no
blood
the
weapon
must
still
have
been
there
some
weapon
with
a
short
and
inconspicuous
handle
i
think
they
said
there
were
flowers
over
and
around
the
place
where
it
struck
yes
great
big
scarlet
ones
nobody
noticed
nobody
looked
a
panic
like
that
seems
to
paralyse
ten
minutes
i
must
see
every
one
who
approached
her
during
those
ten
minutes
every
one
sweetwater
and
i
must
myself
talk
with
miss
you
will
like
her
you
will
believe
every
word
she
no
doubt
all
the
more
reason
why
i
must
see
her
sweetwater
someone
drew
that
weapon
out
effects
still
have
their
causes
notwithstanding
the
new
cult
the
question
is
who
we
must
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
find
that
the
stones
have
all
been
turned
over
by
you
not
altogether
by
then
they
will
bear
being
turned
over
again
i
want
to
be
witness
of
the
where
will
you
see
miss
clarke
wherever
she
pleases
only
i
can
t
walk
i
think
i
know
the
place
you
shall
have
the
use
of
this
elevator
it
has
not
been
running
since
last
night
or
it
would
be
full
of
curious
people
all
the
time
hustling
to
get
a
glimpse
of
this
place
but
they
ll
put
a
man
on
for
very
good
manage
it
as
you
will
i
ll
wait
here
till
you
re
ready
explain
yourself
to
the
lady
tell
her
i
m
an
old
and
rheumatic
invalid
who
has
been
used
to
asking
his
own
questions
i
ll
not
trouble
her
much
but
there
is
one
point
she
must
make
clear
to
sweetwater
did
not
presume
to
ask
what
point
but
he
hoped
to
be
fully
enlightened
when
the
time
came
and
he
was
gryce
had
undertaken
to
educate
him
for
this
work
and
never
missed
the
opportunity
of
giving
him
a
lesson
the
three
met
in
a
private
on
an
upper
floor
the
detectives
entering
first
and
the
lady
coming
in
soon
after
as
her
quiet
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
sweetwater
stole
a
glance
at
gryce
he
was
not
looking
her
way
of
course
he
never
looked
directly
at
anybody
but
he
formed
his
impressions
for
all
that
and
sweetwater
was
anxious
to
make
sure
of
these
impressions
there
was
no
doubting
them
in
this
instance
miss
clarke
was
not
a
woman
to
rouse
an
unfavourable
opinion
in
any
man
s
mind
of
slight
almost
frail
build
she
had
that
peculiar
animation
which
goes
with
a
speaking
eye
and
a
widely
sympathetic
nature
without
any
substantial
claims
to
beauty
her
expression
was
so
womanly
and
so
sweet
that
she
was
invariably
called
lovely
gryce
was
engaged
at
the
moment
in
shifting
his
cane
from
the
right
hand
to
the
left
but
his
manner
was
never
more
encouraging
or
his
smile
more
benevolent
pardon
me
he
apologised
with
one
of
his
bows
i
m
sorry
to
trouble
you
after
all
the
distress
you
must
have
been
under
this
morning
but
there
is
something
i
wish
especially
to
ask
you
in
regard
to
the
dreadful
occurrence
in
which
you
played
so
kind
a
part
you
were
the
first
to
reach
the
prostrate
woman
i
yes
the
boys
jumped
up
and
ran
towards
her
but
they
were
frightened
by
her
looks
and
left
it
for
me
to
put
my
hands
under
her
and
try
to
lift
her
did
you
manage
it
i
succeeded
in
getting
her
head
into
my
lap
nothing
and
sat
so
for
some
little
time
that
is
it
seemed
long
though
i
believe
it
was
not
more
than
a
minute
before
two
men
came
running
from
the
musicians
gallery
one
thinks
so
fast
at
such
a
time
and
feels
so
you
knew
she
was
dead
then
i
felt
her
to
be
how
felt
i
was
sure
i
never
questioned
you
have
seen
women
in
a
faint
yes
many
what
made
the
difference
why
should
you
believe
miss
challoner
dead
simply
because
she
lay
still
and
apparently
lifeless
i
can
not
tell
you
possibly
death
tells
its
own
story
i
only
know
how
i
perhaps
there
was
another
reason
perhaps
that
consciously
or
unconsciously
you
laid
your
palm
upon
her
heart
miss
clarke
started
and
her
sweet
face
showed
a
moment
s
perplexity
did
i
she
queried
musingly
then
with
a
sudden
access
of
feeling
i
may
have
done
so
indeed
i
believe
i
did
my
arms
were
around
her
it
would
not
have
been
an
unnatural
no
a
very
natural
one
i
should
say
can
not
you
tell
me
positively
whether
you
did
this
or
not
yes
i
did
i
had
forgotten
it
but
i
remember
and
the
glance
she
cast
him
while
not
meeting
his
eye
showed
that
she
understood
the
importance
of
the
admission
i
know
she
said
what
you
are
going
to
ask
me
now
did
i
feel
anything
there
but
the
flowers
and
the
tulle
no
gryce
i
did
not
there
was
no
poniard
in
the
gryce
felt
around
found
a
chair
and
sank
into
it
you
are
a
truthful
woman
said
he
and
he
added
more
slowly
composed
enough
in
character
i
should
judge
not
to
have
made
any
mistake
on
this
very
vital
i
think
so
gryce
i
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
of
course
but
the
woman
was
a
stranger
to
me
and
my
feelings
were
not
unduly
sweetwater
we
can
let
my
suggestion
go
in
regard
to
those
ten
minutes
i
spoke
of
the
time
is
narrowed
down
to
one
and
in
that
one
miss
clarke
was
the
only
person
to
touch
the
only
one
echoed
the
lady
catching
perhaps
the
slight
rising
sound
of
query
in
his
voice
i
will
trouble
you
no
so
said
the
old
detective
thoughtfully
sweetwater
help
me
out
of
his
eye
was
dull
and
his
manner
betrayed
exhaustion
but
vigour
returned
to
him
before
he
had
well
reached
the
door
and
he
showed
some
of
his
old
spirit
as
he
thanked
miss
clarke
and
turned
to
take
the
elevator
but
one
possibility
remains
he
confided
to
sweetwater
as
they
stood
waiting
at
the
elevator
door
miss
challoner
died
from
a
stab
the
next
minute
she
was
in
this
lady
s
arms
no
weapon
protruded
from
the
wound
nor
was
any
found
on
or
near
her
in
the
mezzanine
what
follows
she
struck
the
blow
herself
and
the
strength
of
purpose
which
led
her
to
do
this
gave
her
the
additional
force
to
pull
the
weapon
out
and
fling
it
from
her
it
did
not
fall
upon
the
floor
around
her
therefore
it
flew
through
one
of
those
openings
into
the
lobby
and
there
it
either
will
be
or
has
been
it
was
this
statement
otherwise
worded
which
gave
me
my
triumph
over
george
the
red
cloak
what
results
speak
up
none
every
man
woman
and
boy
connected
with
the
hotel
has
been
questioned
many
of
them
routed
out
of
their
beds
for
the
purpose
but
not
one
of
them
picked
up
anything
from
the
floor
of
the
lobby
or
knows
of
any
one
who
there
now
remain
the
and
after
them
pardon
me
gryce
the
general
public
which
rushed
in
rather
promiscuously
last
i
know
it
it
s
a
task
but
it
must
be
carried
through
put
up
bulletins
publish
your
wants
in
the
papers
do
anything
only
gain
your
a
bulletin
was
put
up
some
hours
later
sweetwater
the
room
and
approaching
gryce
with
a
smile
blurted
out
the
bulletin
is
a
great
go
i
think
of
course
i
can
not
be
sure
that
it
s
going
to
do
the
business
i
ve
watched
every
one
who
stopped
to
read
it
many
showed
interest
and
many
emotion
she
seems
to
have
had
a
troop
of
friends
but
embarrassment
only
one
showed
that
i
thought
you
would
like
to
embarrassment
humph
a
man
no
a
woman
a
lady
sir
one
of
the
transients
i
found
out
in
a
jiffy
all
they
could
tell
me
about
a
woman
we
didn
t
expect
that
where
is
she
still
in
the
lobby
no
sir
she
took
the
elevator
while
i
was
talking
with
the
there
s
nothing
in
it
you
mistook
her
i
don
t
think
so
i
had
noticed
her
when
she
first
came
into
the
lobby
she
was
talking
to
her
daughter
who
was
with
her
and
looked
natural
and
happy
but
no
sooner
had
she
seen
and
read
that
bulletin
than
the
blood
shot
up
into
her
face
and
her
manner
became
furtive
and
hasty
there
was
no
mistaking
the
difference
sir
almost
before
i
could
point
her
out
she
had
seized
her
daughter
by
the
arm
and
hurried
her
towards
the
elevator
i
wanted
to
follow
her
but
you
may
prefer
to
make
your
own
inquiries
her
room
is
on
the
seventh
floor
number
and
her
name
is
watkins
horace
watkins
of
gryce
nodded
thoughtfully
but
made
no
immediate
effort
to
rise
is
that
all
you
know
about
her
he
asked
yes
this
is
the
first
time
she
has
stopped
at
this
hotel
she
came
yesterday
took
a
room
indefinitely
seems
all
right
but
she
did
blush
sir
i
ever
saw
its
beat
in
a
young
call
the
desk
say
that
i
m
to
be
told
if
watkins
of
nashville
rings
up
during
the
next
ten
minutes
we
ll
give
her
that
long
to
take
some
action
if
she
fails
to
make
any
move
i
ll
make
my
own
sweetwater
did
as
he
was
bid
then
went
back
to
his
place
in
the
lobby
but
he
returned
almost
instantly
mrs
watkins
has
just
telephoned
down
that
she
is
going
to
to
leave
to
leave
the
old
man
struggled
to
his
feet
no
do
you
say
seven
stories
he
sighed
but
as
he
turned
with
a
hobble
he
stopped
there
are
difficulties
in
the
way
of
this
interview
he
remarked
a
blush
is
not
much
to
go
upon
i
m
afraid
we
shall
have
to
resort
to
the
shadow
business
and
that
is
your
work
not
but
here
the
door
opened
and
a
boy
brought
in
a
line
which
had
been
left
at
the
desk
it
related
to
the
very
matter
then
engaging
them
and
ran
thus
i
see
that
information
is
desired
as
to
whether
any
person
was
seen
to
stoop
to
the
lobby
floor
last
night
at
or
shortly
after
the
critical
moment
of
miss
challoner
s
fall
in
the
half
story
above
i
can
give
such
information
i
was
in
the
lobby
at
the
time
and
in
the
height
of
the
confusion
following
this
alarming
incident
i
remember
seeing
a
lady
one
of
the
new
arrivals
there
were
several
coming
in
at
the
time
stoop
quickly
down
and
pick
up
something
from
the
floor
i
thought
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
and
so
paid
little
attention
to
her
appearance
i
can
only
recall
the
suddenness
with
which
she
stooped
and
the
colour
of
the
cloak
she
wore
it
was
red
and
the
whole
garment
was
voluminous
if
you
wish
further
particulars
though
in
truth
i
have
no
more
to
give
you
can
find
me
in
henry
humph
this
should
simplify
our
task
was
gryce
s
comment
as
he
handed
the
note
over
to
sweetwater
you
can
easily
find
out
if
the
lady
now
on
the
point
of
departure
can
be
identified
with
the
one
described
by
mcelroy
if
she
can
i
am
ready
to
meet
her
here
goes
then
cried
sweetwater
and
quickly
left
the
room
when
he
returned
it
was
not
with
his
most
hopeful
air
the
cloak
doesn
t
help
he
declared
no
one
remembers
the
cloak
but
the
time
of
watkins
arrival
was
all
right
she
came
in
directly
on
the
heels
of
this
she
did
sweetwater
i
will
see
her
manage
it
for
me
at
the
clerk
says
that
it
had
better
be
upstairs
she
is
a
very
sensitive
woman
there
might
be
a
scene
if
she
were
intercepted
on
her
way
very
but
the
look
which
the
old
detective
threw
at
his
bandaged
legs
was
not
without
its
pathos
and
so
it
happened
that
just
as
watkins
was
watching
the
wheeling
out
of
her
trunks
there
appeared
in
the
doorway
before
her
an
elderly
gentleman
whose
expression
always
benevolent
save
at
moments
when
benevolence
would
be
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
situation
had
for
some
reason
so
marked
an
effect
upon
her
that
she
coloured
under
his
eye
and
indeed
showed
such
embarrassment
that
all
doubt
of
the
propriety
of
his
intrusion
vanished
from
the
old
man
s
mind
and
with
the
ease
of
one
only
too
well
accustomed
to
such
scenes
he
kindly
remarked
am
i
speaking
to
watkins
of
nashville
you
are
she
faltered
with
another
rapid
change
of
colour
i
i
am
just
leaving
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
i
i
wish
i
could
he
smiled
hobbling
in
and
confronting
her
quietly
in
her
own
room
but
circumstances
make
it
quite
imperative
that
i
should
have
a
few
words
with
you
on
a
topic
which
need
not
be
disagreeable
to
you
and
probably
will
not
be
my
name
is
gryce
this
will
probably
convey
nothing
to
you
but
i
am
not
unknown
to
the
management
below
and
my
years
must
certainly
give
you
confidence
in
the
propriety
of
my
errand
a
beautiful
and
charming
young
woman
died
here
last
night
may
i
ask
if
you
knew
her
i
she
was
trembling
violently
now
but
whether
with
indignation
or
some
other
more
subtle
emotion
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
no
i
m
from
the
south
i
never
saw
the
young
lady
why
do
you
ask
i
do
not
recognise
your
right
i
i
certainly
her
emotion
must
be
that
of
simple
indignation
gryce
made
one
of
his
low
bows
and
propping
himself
against
the
table
he
stood
before
remarked
civilly
i
had
rather
not
force
my
rights
the
matter
is
so
very
ordinary
i
did
not
suppose
you
knew
miss
challoner
but
one
must
begin
somehow
and
as
you
came
in
at
the
very
moment
when
the
alarm
was
raised
in
the
lobby
i
thought
perhaps
you
could
tell
me
something
which
would
aid
me
in
my
effort
to
elicit
the
real
facts
of
the
case
you
were
crossing
the
lobby
at
the
time
she
raised
her
head
so
were
a
dozen
others
madam
the
interruption
was
made
in
his
kindliest
tones
but
in
a
way
which
nevertheless
suggested
authority
something
was
picked
up
from
the
floor
at
that
moment
if
the
dozen
you
mention
were
witnesses
to
this
act
we
do
not
know
it
but
we
do
know
that
it
did
not
pass
unobserved
by
you
am
i
not
correct
didn
t
you
see
a
certain
person
i
will
mention
no
names
stoop
and
pick
up
something
from
the
lobby
floor
the
word
came
out
with
startling
violence
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
she
was
facing
him
with
determination
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
boldly
on
his
face
but
her
lips
quivered
and
her
cheeks
were
white
too
white
now
for
simple
indignation
then
i
have
made
a
big
mistake
apologised
the
detective
will
you
pardon
me
it
would
have
settled
a
very
serious
question
if
it
could
be
found
that
the
object
thus
picked
up
was
the
weapon
which
killed
miss
challoner
that
is
my
excuse
for
the
trouble
i
have
given
he
was
not
looking
at
her
he
was
looking
at
her
hand
which
rested
on
the
table
before
which
he
himself
stood
did
the
fingers
tighten
a
little
and
dig
into
the
palm
they
concealed
he
thought
so
and
was
very
slow
in
turning
limpingly
about
towards
the
door
meanwhile
would
she
speak
no
the
silence
was
so
marked
he
felt
it
an
excuse
for
stealing
another
glance
in
her
direction
she
was
not
looking
his
way
but
at
a
door
in
the
partition
wall
on
her
right
and
the
look
was
one
very
akin
to
anxious
fear
the
next
moment
he
understood
it
the
door
burst
open
and
a
young
girl
bounded
into
the
room
with
the
merry
cry
all
ready
mother
i
m
glad
we
are
going
to
the
clarendon
i
hate
hotels
where
people
die
almost
before
your
what
the
mother
said
at
this
outburst
is
immaterial
what
the
detective
did
is
not
keeping
on
his
way
he
reached
the
door
but
not
to
open
it
wider
rather
to
close
it
softly
but
with
unmistakable
decision
the
cloak
which
enveloped
the
girl
was
red
and
full
enough
to
be
called
voluminous
who
is
this
demanded
the
girl
her
indignant
glances
flashing
from
one
to
the
other
i
don
t
know
faltered
the
mother
in
very
evident
distress
he
says
he
has
a
right
to
ask
us
questions
and
he
has
been
asking
questions
about
about
not
about
me
laughed
the
girl
with
a
toss
of
her
head
gryce
would
have
corrected
in
one
of
his
grandchildren
he
can
have
nothing
to
say
about
and
she
began
to
move
about
the
room
in
an
aimless
way
gryce
stared
hard
at
the
few
remaining
belongings
of
the
two
women
lying
in
a
heap
on
the
table
and
half
musingly
half
deprecatingly
remarked
the
person
who
stooped
wore
a
long
red
cloak
probably
you
preceded
your
daughter
the
lady
thus
brought
to
the
point
made
a
quick
gesture
towards
the
girl
who
suddenly
stood
still
and
with
a
rising
colour
in
her
cheeks
answered
with
some
show
of
resolution
on
her
own
part
you
say
your
name
is
gryce
and
that
you
have
a
right
to
address
me
thus
pointedly
on
a
subject
which
you
evidently
regard
as
serious
that
is
not
exact
enough
for
me
who
are
you
sir
what
is
your
business
i
think
you
have
guessed
it
i
am
a
detective
from
headquarters
what
i
want
of
you
i
have
already
stated
perhaps
this
young
lady
can
tell
me
what
you
can
not
i
shall
be
pleased
if
this
is
caroline
then
the
mother
broke
down
show
the
gentleman
what
you
picked
up
from
the
lobby
floor
last
the
girl
laughed
again
loudly
and
with
evident
bravado
before
she
threw
the
cloak
back
and
showed
what
she
had
evidently
been
holding
in
her
hand
from
the
first
a
it
was
lying
there
and
i
picked
it
up
i
don
t
see
any
harm
in
you
probably
meant
none
you
couldn
t
have
known
the
part
it
had
just
played
in
this
tragic
drama
said
the
old
detective
looking
carefully
at
the
cutter
which
he
had
taken
in
his
hand
but
not
so
carefully
that
he
failed
to
note
that
the
look
of
distress
was
not
lifted
from
the
mother
s
face
either
by
her
daughter
s
words
or
manner
you
have
washed
this
he
asked
no
why
should
i
wash
it
it
was
clean
enough
i
was
just
going
down
to
give
it
in
at
the
desk
i
wasn
t
going
to
carry
it
and
she
turned
aside
to
the
window
and
began
to
hum
as
though
done
with
the
whole
matter
the
old
detective
rubbed
his
chin
glanced
again
at
the
then
at
the
girl
in
the
window
and
lastly
at
the
mother
who
had
lifted
her
head
again
and
was
facing
him
bravely
it
is
very
important
he
observed
to
the
latter
that
your
daughter
should
be
correct
in
her
statement
as
to
the
condition
of
this
article
when
she
picked
it
up
are
you
sure
she
did
not
wash
it
i
don
t
think
she
did
but
i
m
sure
she
will
tell
you
the
truth
about
that
caroline
this
is
a
police
matter
any
mistake
about
it
may
involve
us
in
a
world
of
trouble
and
keep
you
from
getting
back
home
in
time
for
your
party
did
you
did
you
wash
this
cutter
when
you
got
upstairs
or
or
she
added
with
a
propitiatory
glance
at
gryce
wipe
it
off
at
any
time
between
then
and
now
don
t
answer
hastily
be
sure
no
one
can
blame
you
for
that
act
any
girl
as
thoughtless
as
you
might
do
mother
how
can
i
tell
what
i
did
flashed
out
the
girl
wheeling
round
on
her
heel
till
she
faced
them
both
i
don
t
remember
doing
a
thing
to
it
i
just
brought
it
up
a
thing
found
like
that
belongs
to
the
finder
you
needn
t
hold
it
out
towards
me
like
that
i
don
t
want
it
now
i
m
sick
of
it
such
a
lot
of
talk
about
a
paltry
thing
which
couldn
t
have
cost
ten
and
she
wheeled
back
it
isn
t
the
gryce
could
be
very
patient
it
s
the
fact
that
we
believe
it
to
have
been
answerable
for
miss
challoner
s
death
that
is
if
there
was
any
blood
on
it
when
you
picked
it
blood
the
girl
was
facing
them
again
astonishment
struggling
with
disgust
on
her
plain
but
mobile
features
blood
is
that
what
you
mean
no
wonder
i
hate
it
take
it
away
she
cried
oh
mother
i
ll
never
pick
up
anything
again
which
doesn
t
belong
to
me
blood
she
repeated
in
horror
flinging
herself
into
her
mother
s
arms
gryce
thought
he
understood
the
situation
here
was
a
little
kleptomaniac
whose
weakness
the
mother
was
struggling
to
hide
light
was
pouring
in
he
felt
his
body
s
weight
less
on
that
miserable
foot
of
his
does
that
frighten
you
are
you
so
affected
by
the
thought
of
blood
don
t
ask
me
and
i
put
the
thing
under
my
pillow
i
thought
it
was
so
so
mrs
watkins
gryce
from
that
moment
ignored
the
daughter
did
you
see
it
there
yes
but
i
didn
t
know
where
it
came
from
i
had
not
seen
my
daughter
stoop
i
didn
t
know
where
she
got
it
till
i
read
that
never
mind
that
the
question
agitating
me
is
whether
any
stain
was
left
under
that
pillow
we
want
to
be
sure
of
the
connection
between
this
possible
weapon
and
the
death
by
stabbing
which
we
all
deplore
if
there
is
a
i
didn
t
see
any
stain
but
you
can
look
for
yourself
the
bed
has
been
made
up
but
there
was
no
change
of
linen
we
expected
to
remain
here
i
see
no
good
to
be
gained
by
hiding
any
of
the
facts
none
whatever
come
then
caroline
sit
down
and
stop
crying
gryce
believes
that
your
only
fault
was
in
not
taking
this
object
at
once
to
the
yes
that
s
all
acquiesced
the
detective
after
a
short
study
of
the
shaking
figure
and
distorted
features
of
the
girl
you
had
no
idea
i
m
sure
where
this
weapon
came
from
or
for
what
it
had
been
used
that
s
her
shudder
as
she
seated
herself
was
very
convincing
she
was
too
young
to
simulate
so
successfully
emotions
of
this
character
i
m
glad
of
that
she
responded
half
fretfully
half
gratefully
as
gryce
followed
her
mother
into
the
adjoining
room
i
ve
had
a
bad
enough
time
of
it
without
being
blamed
for
what
i
didn
t
know
and
didn
t
gryce
laid
little
stress
upon
these
words
but
much
upon
the
lack
of
curiosity
she
showed
in
the
minute
and
careful
examination
he
now
made
of
her
room
there
was
no
stain
on
the
and
none
on
the
where
she
might
very
naturally
have
laid
the
cutter
down
on
first
coming
into
her
room
the
blade
was
so
polished
that
it
must
have
been
rubbed
off
somewhere
either
purposely
or
by
accident
where
then
since
not
here
he
asked
to
see
her
gloves
the
ones
she
had
worn
the
previous
night
they
are
the
same
she
is
wearing
now
the
anxious
mother
assured
him
wait
and
i
will
get
them
for
no
need
let
her
hold
out
her
hands
in
token
of
amity
i
shall
soon
they
returned
to
where
the
girl
still
sat
wrapped
in
her
cloak
sobbing
still
but
not
so
violently
caroline
you
may
take
off
your
things
said
the
mother
drawing
the
pins
from
her
own
hat
we
shall
not
go
the
child
shot
her
mother
one
disappointed
look
then
proceeded
to
follow
suit
when
her
hat
was
off
she
began
to
take
off
her
gloves
as
soon
as
they
were
on
the
table
the
mother
pushed
them
over
to
gryce
as
he
looked
at
them
the
girl
lifted
off
her
cloak
will
will
he
tell
she
whispered
behind
its
ample
folds
into
her
mother
s
ear
the
answer
came
quickly
but
not
in
the
mother
s
tones
gryce
s
ears
had
lost
none
of
their
ancient
acuteness
i
do
not
see
that
i
should
gain
much
by
doing
so
the
one
discovery
which
would
link
this
find
of
yours
indissolubly
with
miss
challoner
s
death
i
have
failed
to
make
if
i
am
equally
unsuccessful
below
if
i
can
establish
no
closer
connection
there
than
here
between
this
cutter
and
the
weapon
which
killed
miss
challoner
i
shall
have
no
cause
to
mention
the
matter
it
will
be
too
extraneous
to
the
case
do
you
remember
the
exact
spot
where
you
stooped
miss
watkins
no
no
somewhere
near
those
big
chairs
i
didn
t
have
to
step
out
of
my
way
i
really
didn
gryce
s
answering
smile
was
a
study
it
seemed
to
convey
a
message
one
for
the
mother
and
one
for
the
child
and
both
were
comforting
but
he
went
away
disappointed
the
clew
which
promised
so
much
was
to
all
appearance
a
false
one
he
could
soon
tell
vi
integrity
gryce
s
fears
were
only
too
well
founded
though
mcelroy
was
kind
enough
to
point
out
the
exact
spot
where
he
saw
miss
watkins
stoop
no
trace
of
blood
was
found
upon
the
rug
which
had
lain
there
nor
had
anything
of
the
kind
been
washed
up
by
the
very
careful
man
who
scrubbed
the
lobby
floor
in
the
early
morning
this
was
disappointing
as
its
presence
would
have
settled
the
whole
question
when
these
efforts
all
exhausted
the
two
detectives
faced
each
other
again
in
the
small
room
given
up
to
their
use
gryce
showed
his
discouragement
to
be
certain
of
a
fact
you
can
not
prove
has
not
the
same
alluring
quality
for
the
old
that
it
has
for
the
young
sweetwater
watched
him
in
some
concern
then
with
the
persistence
which
was
one
of
his
strong
points
ventured
finally
to
remark
i
have
but
one
idea
left
on
the
and
what
is
that
old
as
he
was
gryce
was
alert
in
a
moment
the
girl
wore
a
red
cloak
if
i
mistake
not
the
lining
was
also
red
a
spot
on
it
might
not
show
to
the
casual
observer
yet
it
would
mean
much
to
sweetwater
a
faint
blush
rose
to
the
old
man
s
cheek
shall
i
request
the
privilege
of
looking
that
garment
over
the
young
fellow
ducked
and
left
the
room
when
he
returned
it
was
with
a
downcast
air
nothing
doing
said
he
and
then
there
was
silence
we
only
need
to
find
out
now
that
this
cutter
was
not
even
miss
challoner
s
property
remarked
gryce
at
last
with
a
gesture
towards
the
object
named
lying
openly
on
the
table
before
him
that
should
be
easy
shall
i
take
it
to
their
rooms
and
show
it
to
her
maid
if
you
can
do
so
without
disturbing
the
old
but
here
they
were
themselves
disturbed
a
knock
at
the
door
was
followed
by
the
immediate
entrance
of
the
very
person
just
mentioned
challoner
had
come
in
search
of
the
inspector
and
showed
some
surprise
to
find
his
place
occupied
by
an
unknown
old
man
but
gryce
who
discerned
tidings
in
the
bereaved
father
s
face
was
all
alacrity
in
an
instant
greeting
his
visitor
with
a
smile
which
few
could
see
without
trusting
the
man
he
explained
the
inspector
s
absence
and
introduced
himself
in
his
own
capacity
challoner
had
heard
of
him
nevertheless
he
did
not
seem
inclined
to
speak
gryce
motioned
sweetwater
from
the
room
with
a
woeful
look
the
young
detective
withdrew
his
last
glance
cast
at
the
cutter
still
lying
in
full
view
on
the
table
gryce
not
unmindful
himself
of
this
object
took
it
up
then
laid
it
down
again
with
an
air
of
seeming
abstraction
the
father
s
attention
was
caught
what
is
that
he
cried
advancing
a
step
and
bestowing
more
than
an
ordinary
glance
at
the
object
thus
brought
casually
as
it
were
to
his
notice
i
surely
recognise
this
cutter
does
it
belong
here
or
gryce
observing
the
other
s
emotion
motioned
him
to
a
chair
as
his
visitor
sank
into
it
he
remarked
with
all
the
consideration
exacted
by
the
situation
it
is
unknown
property
challoner
but
we
have
some
reason
to
think
it
belonged
to
your
daughter
are
we
correct
in
this
surmise
i
have
seen
it
or
one
like
it
often
in
her
here
his
eyes
suddenly
dilated
and
the
hand
stretched
forth
to
grasp
it
quickly
drew
back
where
where
was
it
found
he
hoarsely
demanded
o
god
am
i
to
be
crushed
to
the
very
earth
by
sorrow
gryce
hastened
to
give
him
such
relief
as
was
consistent
with
the
truth
it
was
picked
up
last
night
from
the
lobby
floor
there
is
seemingly
nothing
to
connect
it
with
her
death
yet
the
pause
was
eloquent
challoner
gave
the
detective
an
agonised
look
and
turned
white
to
the
lips
then
gradually
as
the
silence
continued
his
head
fell
forward
and
he
muttered
almost
unintelligibly
i
honestly
believe
her
the
victim
of
some
heartless
stranger
i
do
now
but
but
i
can
not
mislead
the
police
at
any
cost
i
must
retract
a
statement
i
made
under
false
impressions
and
with
no
desire
to
deceive
i
said
that
i
knew
all
of
the
gentlemen
who
admired
her
and
aspired
to
her
hand
and
that
they
were
all
reputable
men
and
above
committing
a
crime
of
this
or
any
other
kind
but
it
seems
that
i
did
not
know
her
secret
heart
as
thoroughly
as
i
had
supposed
among
her
effects
i
have
just
come
upon
a
batch
of
letters
love
letters
i
am
forced
to
acknowledge
signed
by
initials
totally
strange
to
me
the
letters
are
manly
in
tone
most
of
them
but
one
what
about
the
one
shows
that
the
writer
was
displeased
it
may
mean
nothing
but
i
could
not
let
the
matter
go
without
setting
myself
right
with
the
authorities
if
it
might
be
allowed
to
rest
here
if
those
letters
can
remain
sacred
it
would
save
me
the
additional
pang
of
seeing
her
inmost
concerns
the
secret
and
holiest
recesses
of
a
woman
s
heart
laid
open
to
the
public
for
from
the
tenor
of
most
of
these
letters
she
she
was
not
averse
to
the
gryce
moved
a
little
restlessly
in
his
chair
and
stared
hard
at
the
cutter
so
conveniently
placed
under
his
eye
then
his
manner
softened
and
he
remarked
we
will
do
what
we
can
but
you
must
understand
that
the
matter
is
not
a
simple
one
that
in
fact
it
contains
mysteries
which
demand
police
investigation
we
do
not
dare
to
trifle
with
any
of
the
facts
the
inspector
and
if
not
he
the
coroner
will
have
to
be
told
about
these
letters
and
will
probably
ask
to
see
they
are
the
letters
of
a
with
the
one
yes
that
is
then
in
a
sudden
heat
and
with
an
almost
sublime
trust
in
his
daughter
notwithstanding
the
duplicity
he
had
just
discovered
nothing
not
the
story
told
by
these
letters
or
the
sight
of
that
sturdy
with
its
long
and
very
slender
blade
will
make
me
believe
that
she
willingly
took
her
own
life
you
do
not
know
can
not
know
the
rare
delicacy
of
her
nature
she
was
a
lady
through
and
through
if
she
had
meditated
death
if
the
breach
suggested
by
the
one
letter
i
have
mentioned
should
have
so
preyed
upon
her
spirits
as
to
lead
her
to
break
her
old
father
s
heart
and
outrage
the
feelings
of
all
who
knew
her
she
could
not
being
the
woman
she
was
choose
a
public
place
for
such
an
act
an
hotel
in
face
of
a
lobby
full
of
hurrying
men
it
was
out
of
nature
every
one
who
knows
her
will
tell
you
so
the
deed
was
an
accident
incredible
but
still
an
gryce
had
respect
for
this
outburst
making
no
attempt
to
answer
it
he
suggested
with
some
hesitation
that
miss
challoner
had
been
seen
writing
a
letter
previous
to
taking
those
fatal
steps
from
the
desk
which
ended
so
tragically
was
this
letter
to
one
of
her
lady
friends
as
reported
and
was
it
as
far
from
suggesting
the
awful
tragedy
which
followed
as
he
had
been
told
it
was
a
cheerful
letter
such
a
one
as
she
often
wrote
to
her
little
protegees
here
and
there
i
judge
that
this
was
written
to
some
girl
like
that
for
the
person
addressed
was
not
known
to
her
maid
any
more
than
she
was
to
me
it
expressed
an
affectionate
interest
and
it
breathed
encouragement
encouragement
and
she
meditating
her
own
death
at
the
moment
impossible
that
letter
should
exonerate
her
if
nothing
else
gryce
recalled
the
incongruities
the
inconsistencies
and
even
the
surprising
contradictions
which
had
often
marked
the
conduct
of
men
and
women
in
his
lengthy
experience
with
the
strange
the
sudden
and
the
tragic
things
of
life
and
slightly
shook
his
head
he
pitied
challoner
and
admired
even
more
his
courage
in
face
of
the
appalling
grief
which
had
overwhelmed
him
but
he
dared
not
encourage
a
false
hope
the
girl
had
killed
herself
and
with
this
weapon
they
might
not
be
able
to
prove
it
absolutely
but
it
was
nevertheless
true
and
this
broken
old
man
would
some
day
be
obliged
to
acknowledge
it
but
the
detective
said
nothing
of
this
and
was
very
patient
with
the
further
arguments
the
other
advanced
to
prove
his
point
and
the
lofty
character
of
the
girl
to
whom
misled
by
appearance
the
police
seemed
inclined
to
attribute
the
awful
sin
of
but
when
this
topic
exhausted
challoner
rose
to
leave
the
room
gryce
showed
where
his
own
thoughts
still
centred
by
asking
him
the
date
of
the
correspondence
discovered
between
his
daughter
and
her
unknown
admirer
some
of
the
letters
were
dated
last
summer
some
this
fall
the
one
you
are
most
anxious
to
hear
about
only
a
month
back
he
added
with
unconquerable
devotion
to
what
he
considered
his
duty
gryce
would
like
to
have
carried
his
inquiries
further
but
desisted
his
heart
was
full
of
compassion
for
this
childless
old
man
doomed
to
have
his
choicest
memories
disturbed
by
cruel
doubts
which
possibly
would
never
be
removed
to
his
own
complete
satisfaction
but
when
he
was
gone
and
sweetwater
had
returned
gryce
made
it
his
first
duty
to
communicate
to
his
superiors
the
hitherto
unsuspected
fact
of
a
secret
romance
in
miss
challoner
s
seemingly
calm
and
life
she
had
loved
and
been
loved
by
one
of
whom
her
family
knew
nothing
and
the
two
had
quarrelled
as
certain
letters
lately
found
could
be
made
to
show
vii
the
letters
before
a
table
strewn
with
papers
in
the
room
we
have
already
mentioned
as
given
over
to
the
use
of
the
police
sat
heath
in
a
mood
too
thoughtful
to
notice
the
entrance
of
gryce
and
sweetwater
from
the
where
they
had
been
having
dinner
however
as
the
former
s
tread
was
somewhat
lumbering
the
coroner
s
attention
was
caught
before
they
had
quite
crossed
the
room
and
sweetwater
with
his
quick
eye
noted
how
his
arm
and
hand
immediately
fell
so
as
to
cover
up
a
portion
of
the
papers
lying
nearest
to
him
well
gryce
this
is
a
dark
case
he
observed
as
at
his
bidding
the
two
detectives
took
their
seats
gryce
nodded
so
did
sweetwater
the
darkest
that
has
ever
come
to
my
knowledge
pursued
the
coroner
gryce
again
nodded
but
not
so
sweetwater
for
some
reason
this
simple
expression
of
opinion
seemed
to
have
given
him
a
mental
start
she
was
not
shot
she
was
not
struck
by
any
other
hand
yet
she
lies
dead
from
a
mortal
wound
in
the
breast
though
there
is
no
tangible
proof
of
her
having
inflicted
this
wound
upon
herself
the
jury
will
have
no
alternative
i
fear
than
to
pronounce
the
case
one
of
i
m
sorry
that
i
ve
been
able
to
do
so
little
remarked
gryce
the
coroner
darted
him
a
quick
look
you
are
not
satisfied
you
have
some
different
idea
he
asked
the
detective
frowned
at
his
hands
crossed
over
the
top
of
his
cane
then
shaking
his
head
replied
the
verdict
you
mention
is
the
only
natural
one
of
course
i
see
that
you
have
been
talking
with
miss
challoner
s
former
maid
yes
and
she
has
settled
an
important
point
for
us
there
was
a
possibility
of
course
that
the
which
you
brought
to
my
notice
had
never
gone
with
her
into
the
mezzanine
that
she
or
some
other
person
had
dropped
it
in
passing
through
the
lobby
but
this
girl
assures
me
that
her
mistress
did
not
enter
the
lobby
that
night
that
she
accompanied
her
down
in
the
elevator
and
saw
her
step
off
at
the
mezzanine
she
can
also
swear
that
the
cutter
was
in
a
book
she
carried
the
book
we
found
lying
on
the
desk
the
girl
remembers
distinctly
seeing
its
peculiarly
chased
handle
projecting
from
its
pages
could
anything
be
more
satisfactory
if
i
was
going
to
say
if
the
young
lady
had
been
of
the
impulsive
type
and
the
provocation
greater
but
miss
challoner
s
nature
was
calm
and
were
it
not
for
these
letters
here
his
arm
shifted
a
little
i
should
not
be
so
sure
of
my
jury
s
future
verdict
love
he
went
on
after
a
moment
of
silent
consideration
of
a
letter
he
had
chosen
from
those
before
him
disturbs
the
most
equable
natures
when
it
enters
as
a
factor
we
can
expect
anything
as
you
know
and
miss
challoner
evidently
was
much
attached
to
her
correspondent
and
naturally
felt
the
reproach
conveyed
in
these
and
heath
read
dear
miss
challoner
only
a
man
of
small
spirit
could
endure
what
i
endured
from
you
the
other
day
love
such
as
mine
would
be
respectable
in
a
and
i
think
that
even
you
will
acknowledge
that
i
stand
somewhat
higher
than
that
though
i
was
silent
under
your
disapprobation
you
shall
yet
have
your
answer
it
will
not
lack
point
because
of
its
necessary
a
threat
the
words
sprang
from
sweetwater
and
were
evidently
involuntary
heath
paid
no
notice
but
gryce
in
shifting
his
hands
on
his
cane
top
gave
them
a
sidelong
look
which
was
not
without
a
hint
of
fresh
interest
in
a
case
concerning
which
he
had
believed
himself
to
have
said
his
last
word
it
is
the
only
letter
of
them
all
which
conveys
anything
like
a
reproach
proceeded
the
coroner
the
rest
are
ardent
enough
and
i
must
acknowledge
that
so
far
as
i
have
allowed
myself
to
look
into
them
sufficiently
respectful
her
surprise
must
consequently
have
been
great
at
receiving
these
lines
and
her
resentment
equally
so
if
the
two
met
afterwards
but
i
have
not
shown
you
the
signature
to
the
poor
father
it
conveyed
nothing
some
facts
have
been
kept
from
him
but
to
us
here
he
whirled
the
letter
about
so
that
sweetwater
at
least
could
see
the
name
it
conveys
a
hope
that
we
may
yet
understand
miss
brotherson
exclaimed
the
young
detective
in
loud
surprise
brotherson
the
man
who
the
man
who
left
this
building
just
before
or
simultaneously
with
the
alarm
caused
by
miss
challoner
s
fall
it
clears
away
some
of
the
clouds
befogging
us
she
probably
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
lobby
and
in
the
passion
of
the
moment
forgot
her
usual
instincts
and
drove
the
weapon
into
her
brotherson
the
word
came
softly
now
and
with
a
thoughtful
intonation
he
saw
her
why
do
you
say
that
would
he
have
washed
his
hands
in
the
snow
if
he
had
been
in
ignorance
of
the
occurrence
he
was
the
real
if
not
active
cause
of
her
death
and
he
knew
it
either
he
excuse
me
heath
and
gryce
it
is
not
for
me
to
obtrude
my
have
you
settled
it
beyond
dispute
that
brotherson
is
really
the
man
who
was
seen
doing
this
no
sir
i
have
not
had
a
minute
for
that
job
but
i
m
ready
for
the
business
any
time
you
see
fit
to
spare
let
it
be
or
if
you
can
manage
it
we
want
the
man
even
if
he
is
not
the
hero
of
that
romantic
episode
he
wrote
these
letters
and
he
must
explain
the
last
one
his
initials
as
you
see
are
not
ordinary
ones
and
you
will
find
them
at
the
bottom
of
all
these
sheets
he
was
brave
enough
or
arrogant
enough
to
sign
the
questionable
one
with
his
full
name
this
may
speak
well
for
him
and
it
may
not
it
is
for
you
to
decide
that
where
will
you
look
for
him
sweetwater
no
one
here
knows
his
not
miss
challoner
s
maid
no
the
name
is
a
new
one
to
her
but
she
made
it
very
evident
that
she
was
not
surprised
to
hear
that
her
mistress
was
in
secret
correspondence
with
a
member
of
the
male
sex
much
can
be
hidden
from
servants
but
not
i
ll
find
the
man
i
have
a
double
reason
for
doing
that
now
he
shall
not
escape
heath
expressed
his
satisfaction
and
gave
some
orders
meanwhile
gryce
had
not
uttered
a
word
viii
strange
doings
for
george
that
evening
george
sat
so
long
over
the
newspapers
that
in
spite
of
my
absorbing
interest
in
the
topic
engrossing
me
i
fell
asleep
in
my
cozy
little
rocking
chair
i
was
awakened
by
what
seemed
like
a
kiss
falling
very
softly
on
my
forehead
though
to
be
sure
it
may
have
been
only
the
flap
of
george
s
coat
sleeve
as
he
stooped
over
me
wake
up
little
woman
i
heard
and
trot
away
to
bed
i
m
going
out
and
may
not
be
in
till
you
going
out
at
ten
o
clock
at
night
tired
as
you
are
as
we
both
are
what
has
happened
oh
this
broken
exclamation
escaped
me
as
i
perceived
in
the
dim
background
by
the
door
the
figure
of
a
man
who
called
up
recent
but
very
thrilling
experiences
mr
sweetwater
explained
george
we
are
going
out
together
it
is
necessary
or
you
may
be
sure
i
should
not
leave
i
was
quite
wide
awake
enough
by
now
to
understand
oh
i
know
you
are
going
to
hunt
up
the
man
how
i
wish
but
george
did
not
wait
for
me
to
express
my
wishes
he
gave
me
a
little
good
advice
as
to
how
i
had
better
employ
my
time
in
his
absence
and
was
off
before
i
could
find
words
to
answer
this
ends
all
i
have
to
say
about
myself
but
the
events
of
that
night
carefully
related
to
me
by
george
are
important
enough
for
me
to
describe
them
with
all
the
detail
which
is
their
rightful
due
i
shall
tell
the
story
as
i
have
already
been
led
to
do
in
other
portions
of
this
narrative
as
though
i
were
present
and
shared
the
adventure
as
soon
as
the
two
were
in
the
street
the
detective
turned
towards
george
and
said
mr
anderson
i
have
a
great
deal
to
ask
of
you
the
business
before
us
is
not
a
simple
one
and
i
fear
that
i
shall
have
to
subject
you
to
more
inconvenience
than
is
customary
in
matters
like
this
brotherson
has
vanished
that
is
in
his
own
proper
person
but
i
have
an
idea
that
i
am
on
the
track
of
one
who
will
lead
us
very
directly
to
him
if
we
manage
the
affair
carefully
what
i
want
of
you
of
course
is
mere
identification
you
saw
the
face
of
the
man
who
washed
his
hands
in
the
snow
and
would
know
it
again
you
say
do
you
think
you
could
be
quite
sure
of
yourself
if
the
man
were
differently
dressed
and
differently
occupied
i
think
so
there
s
his
height
and
a
certain
strong
look
in
his
face
i
can
not
describe
you
don
t
need
to
come
we
re
all
right
you
don
t
mind
making
a
night
of
it
not
if
it
is
that
we
can
t
tell
and
with
a
characteristic
shrug
and
smile
the
detective
led
the
way
to
a
taxicab
which
stood
in
waiting
at
the
corner
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
rather
fast
riding
brought
them
into
a
tangle
of
streets
on
the
east
side
as
george
noticed
the
swarming
sidewalks
and
listened
to
the
noises
incident
to
an
quarter
he
could
not
forbear
despite
the
injunction
he
had
received
to
express
his
surprise
at
the
direction
of
their
search
surely
said
he
the
gentleman
i
have
described
can
have
no
friends
then
bethinking
himself
he
added
but
if
he
has
reasons
to
fear
the
law
naturally
he
would
seek
to
lose
himself
in
a
place
as
different
as
possible
from
his
usual
yes
that
would
be
some
men
s
way
was
the
curt
almost
indifferent
answer
he
received
sweetwater
was
looking
this
way
and
that
from
the
window
beside
him
and
now
leaning
out
gave
some
directions
to
the
driver
which
altered
their
course
when
they
stopped
which
was
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
to
george
we
shall
have
to
walk
now
for
a
block
or
two
i
m
anxious
to
attract
no
attention
nor
is
it
desirable
for
you
to
do
so
if
you
can
manage
to
act
as
if
you
were
accustomed
to
the
place
and
just
leave
all
the
talking
to
me
we
ought
to
get
along
don
t
be
astonished
at
anything
you
see
and
trust
me
for
the
rest
that
s
they
alighted
and
he
dismissed
the
taxicab
some
clock
in
the
neighbourhood
struck
the
hour
of
ten
good
we
shall
be
in
time
muttered
the
detective
and
led
the
way
down
the
street
and
round
a
corner
or
so
till
they
came
to
a
block
darker
than
the
rest
and
much
less
noisy
it
had
a
sinister
look
and
george
who
is
brave
enough
under
all
ordinary
circumstances
was
glad
that
his
companion
wore
a
badge
and
carried
a
whistle
he
was
also
relieved
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
burly
form
of
a
policeman
in
the
shadow
of
one
of
the
doorways
yet
the
houses
he
saw
before
him
were
not
so
very
different
from
those
they
had
already
passed
his
uneasiness
could
not
have
sprung
from
them
they
had
even
an
air
of
positive
respectability
as
though
inhabited
by
industrious
workmen
then
what
was
it
which
made
the
close
companionship
of
a
member
of
the
police
so
uncommonly
welcome
was
it
a
certain
aspect
of
solitariness
which
clung
to
the
block
or
was
it
the
sudden
appearance
here
and
there
of
strangely
gliding
figures
which
no
sooner
loomed
up
against
the
snowy
perspective
than
they
disappeared
again
in
some
unseen
doorway
there
s
a
meeting
on
of
the
associated
brotherhood
of
the
awl
the
plane
and
the
trowel
whatever
that
means
and
it
is
the
speaker
we
want
to
see
the
man
who
is
to
address
them
promptly
at
ten
o
clock
do
you
object
to
meetings
is
this
a
secret
one
it
wasn
t
are
we
carpenters
or
masons
that
we
can
count
on
admittance
i
am
a
carpenter
don
t
you
think
you
can
be
a
mason
for
the
occasion
i
doubt
it
but
hush
i
must
speak
to
this
george
stood
back
and
a
few
words
passed
between
sweetwater
and
a
shadowy
figure
which
seemed
to
have
sprung
up
out
of
the
sidewalk
balked
at
the
outset
were
the
encouraging
words
with
which
the
detective
rejoined
george
it
seems
that
a
is
necessary
and
my
friend
has
been
unable
to
get
it
will
the
speaker
pass
out
this
way
he
inquired
of
the
shadowy
figure
still
lingering
in
their
rear
he
didn
t
go
in
by
it
yet
i
believe
he
s
safe
enough
inside
was
the
muttered
answer
sweetwater
had
no
relish
for
disappointments
of
this
character
but
it
was
not
long
before
he
straightened
up
and
allowed
himself
to
exchange
a
few
more
words
with
this
mysterious
person
these
appeared
to
be
of
a
more
encouraging
nature
than
the
last
for
it
was
not
long
before
the
detective
returned
with
renewed
alacrity
to
george
and
wheeling
him
about
began
to
retrace
his
steps
to
the
corner
are
we
going
back
are
you
going
to
give
up
the
job
george
asked
no
we
re
going
to
take
him
from
the
rear
there
s
a
break
in
the
fence
oh
we
ll
do
very
well
trust
george
laughed
he
was
growing
excited
but
not
altogether
agreeably
so
he
says
that
he
has
seen
moments
of
more
pleasant
anticipation
evidently
my
good
husband
is
not
cut
out
for
detective
work
where
they
went
under
this
officer
s
guidance
he
can
not
tell
the
tortuous
tangle
of
alleys
through
which
he
now
felt
himself
led
was
dark
as
the
nether
regions
to
his
unaccustomed
eyes
there
was
snow
under
his
feet
and
now
and
then
he
brushed
against
some
obtruding
object
or
stumbled
against
a
low
fence
but
beyond
these
slight
miscalculations
on
his
own
part
he
was
a
mere
automaton
in
the
hands
of
his
eager
guide
and
only
became
his
own
man
again
when
they
suddenly
stepped
into
an
open
yard
and
he
could
discern
plainly
before
him
the
dark
walls
of
a
building
pointed
out
by
sweetwater
as
their
probable
destination
yet
even
here
they
encountered
some
impediment
which
prohibited
a
close
approach
a
wall
or
shed
cut
off
their
view
of
the
building
s
lower
storey
and
though
somewhat
startled
at
being
left
unceremoniously
alone
after
just
a
whispered
word
of
encouragement
from
the
ever
ready
detective
george
could
quite
understand
the
necessity
which
that
person
must
feel
for
a
quiet
reconnoitering
of
the
surroundings
before
the
two
of
them
ventured
further
forward
in
their
possibly
hazardous
undertaking
yet
the
experience
was
none
too
pleasing
to
george
and
he
was
very
glad
to
hear
sweetwater
s
whisper
again
at
his
ear
and
to
feel
himself
rescued
from
the
pool
of
slush
in
which
he
had
been
left
to
stand
the
approach
is
not
all
that
can
be
desired
remarked
the
detective
as
they
entered
what
appeared
to
be
a
low
shed
the
broken
board
has
been
put
back
and
securely
nailed
in
place
and
if
i
am
not
very
much
mistaken
there
is
a
fellow
stationed
in
the
yard
who
will
want
the
too
looks
shady
to
me
i
ll
have
something
to
tell
the
chief
when
i
get
but
we
what
are
we
going
to
do
if
we
can
not
get
in
front
or
rear
we
re
going
to
wait
right
here
in
the
hopes
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
our
man
as
he
comes
out
returned
the
detective
drawing
george
towards
a
low
window
overlooking
the
yard
he
had
described
as
sentinelled
he
will
have
to
pass
directly
under
this
window
on
his
way
to
the
alley
sweetwater
went
on
to
explain
and
if
i
can
only
raise
it
but
the
noise
would
give
us
away
i
can
t
do
perhaps
it
swings
on
hinges
suggested
george
it
looks
like
that
sort
of
a
if
it
should
well
it
does
we
re
in
great
luck
sir
but
before
i
pull
it
open
remember
that
from
the
moment
i
unlatch
it
everything
said
or
done
here
can
be
heard
in
the
adjoining
yard
so
no
whispers
and
no
unnecessary
movements
when
you
hear
him
coming
as
sooner
or
later
you
certainly
will
fall
carefully
to
your
knees
and
lean
out
just
far
enough
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
before
he
steps
down
from
the
porch
if
he
stops
to
light
his
cigar
or
to
pass
a
few
words
with
some
of
the
men
he
will
leave
behind
you
may
get
a
plain
enough
view
of
his
face
or
figure
to
identify
him
the
light
is
burning
low
in
that
rear
hall
but
it
will
do
if
it
does
not
if
you
can
t
see
him
or
if
you
do
don
t
hang
out
of
the
window
more
than
a
second
duck
after
your
first
look
i
don
t
want
to
be
caught
at
this
job
with
no
better
opportunity
for
escape
than
we
have
here
can
you
remember
all
that
george
pinched
his
arm
encouragingly
and
sweetwater
with
an
amused
grunt
softly
unlatched
the
window
and
pulled
it
wide
open
a
fine
sleet
flew
in
imperceptible
save
for
the
sensation
of
damp
it
gave
and
the
slight
haze
it
diffused
through
the
air
enlarged
by
this
haze
the
building
they
were
set
to
watch
rose
in
magnified
proportions
at
their
left
the
yard
between
piled
high
in
the
centre
with
or
other
heaps
covered
with
snow
could
not
have
been
more
than
forty
feet
square
the
window
from
which
they
peered
was
down
this
yard
so
that
a
comparatively
short
distance
separated
them
from
the
porch
where
george
had
been
told
to
look
for
the
man
he
was
expected
to
identify
all
was
dark
there
at
present
but
he
could
hear
from
time
to
time
some
sounds
of
restless
movement
as
the
guard
posted
inside
shifted
in
his
narrow
quarters
or
struck
his
benumbed
feet
softly
together
but
what
came
to
them
from
above
was
more
interesting
than
anything
to
be
heard
or
seen
below
a
man
s
voice
raised
to
a
wonderful
pitch
by
the
passion
of
oratory
had
burst
the
barriers
of
the
closed
hall
in
that
towering
third
storey
and
was
carrying
its
tale
to
other
ears
than
those
within
had
it
been
summer
and
the
windows
open
both
george
and
sweetwater
might
have
heard
every
word
for
the
tones
were
exceptionally
rich
and
penetrating
and
the
speaker
intent
only
on
the
impression
he
was
endeavouring
to
make
upon
his
audience
that
he
had
not
mistaken
his
power
in
this
direction
was
evinced
by
the
applause
which
rose
from
time
to
time
from
innumerable
hands
and
feet
but
this
uproar
would
be
speedily
silenced
and
the
mellow
voice
ring
out
again
clear
and
commanding
what
could
the
subject
be
to
rouse
such
enthusiasm
in
the
associated
brotherhood
of
the
awl
the
plane
and
the
trowel
there
was
a
moment
when
our
listening
friends
expected
to
be
enlightened
a
shutter
was
thrown
back
in
one
of
those
upper
windows
and
the
window
hurriedly
raised
during
which
words
took
the
place
of
sounds
and
they
heard
enough
to
whet
their
appetite
for
more
but
only
that
the
shutter
was
speedily
restored
to
place
and
the
window
again
closed
a
wise
precaution
or
so
thought
george
if
they
wished
to
keep
their
doubtful
proceedings
secret
a
tirade
against
the
rich
and
a
loud
call
to
battle
could
be
gleaned
from
the
few
sentences
they
had
heard
but
its
virulence
and
pointed
attack
was
not
that
of
the
demagogue
or
business
agent
but
of
a
man
whose
intellect
and
culture
rang
in
every
tone
and
informed
each
sentence
sweetwater
in
whom
satisfaction
was
fast
taking
the
place
of
impatience
and
regret
pushed
the
window
to
before
asking
george
this
question
did
you
hear
the
voice
of
the
man
whose
action
attracted
your
attention
outside
the
clermont
did
you
note
just
now
the
large
shadow
dancing
on
the
ceiling
over
the
speaker
s
head
yes
but
i
could
judge
nothing
from
well
he
s
a
rum
one
i
shan
t
open
this
window
again
till
he
gives
signs
of
reaching
the
end
of
his
speech
it
s
too
but
almost
immediately
he
gave
a
start
and
pressing
george
s
arm
appeared
to
listen
not
to
the
speech
which
was
no
longer
audible
but
to
something
much
nearer
a
step
or
movement
in
the
adjoining
yard
at
least
so
george
interpreted
the
quick
turn
which
this
impetuous
detective
made
and
the
pains
he
took
to
direct
george
s
attention
to
the
walk
running
under
the
window
beneath
which
they
crouched
someone
was
stealing
down
upon
the
house
at
their
left
from
the
alley
beyond
a
big
man
whose
shoulder
brushed
the
window
as
he
went
by
george
felt
his
hand
seized
again
and
pressed
as
this
happened
and
before
he
had
recovered
from
this
excitement
experienced
another
quick
pressure
and
still
another
as
one
two
three
additional
figures
went
slipping
by
then
his
hand
was
suddenly
dropped
for
a
cry
had
shot
up
from
the
door
where
the
sentinel
stood
guard
followed
by
a
sudden
loud
slam
and
the
noise
of
a
shooting
bolt
which
proclaiming
as
it
did
that
the
invaders
were
not
friends
but
enemies
to
the
cause
which
was
being
vaunted
above
so
excited
sweetwater
that
he
pulled
the
window
wide
open
and
took
a
bold
look
out
george
followed
his
example
and
this
was
what
they
saw
three
men
were
standing
flat
against
the
fence
leading
from
the
shed
directly
to
the
porch
the
fourth
was
crouching
within
the
latter
and
in
another
moment
they
heard
his
fist
descend
upon
the
door
inside
in
a
way
to
rouse
the
echoes
meantime
the
voice
in
the
audience
hall
above
had
ceased
and
there
could
be
heard
instead
the
scramble
of
hurrying
feet
and
the
noise
of
overturning
benches
then
a
window
flew
up
and
a
voice
called
down
who
s
that
what
do
you
want
down
there
but
before
an
answer
could
be
shouted
back
this
man
was
drawn
fiercely
inside
and
the
scramble
was
renewed
amid
which
george
heard
sweetwater
s
whisper
at
his
ear
it
s
the
police
the
chief
has
got
ahead
of
me
was
that
the
man
we
re
after
the
one
who
shouted
down
no
neither
was
he
the
speaker
the
voices
are
very
we
want
the
speaker
if
the
boys
get
him
we
re
all
right
but
if
they
don
t
wait
i
must
make
the
matter
and
with
a
bound
he
vaulted
through
the
window
whistling
in
a
peculiar
way
george
thus
left
quite
alone
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
sole
protector
mix
with
the
boys
as
he
called
them
and
ultimately
crowd
in
with
them
through
the
door
which
had
finally
been
opened
for
their
admittance
then
came
a
wait
and
then
the
quiet
of
the
detective
alone
and
in
no
very
amiable
mood
well
inquired
george
somewhat
breathlessly
do
you
want
me
they
don
t
seem
to
be
coming
no
they
ve
gone
the
other
way
it
was
a
red
hot
anarchist
meeting
and
no
mistake
they
have
arrested
one
of
the
speakers
but
the
other
escaped
how
we
have
not
yet
found
out
but
i
think
there
s
a
way
out
somewhere
by
which
he
got
the
start
of
us
he
was
the
man
i
wanted
you
to
see
bad
luck
anderson
but
i
m
not
at
the
end
of
my
resources
if
you
ll
have
patience
with
me
and
accompany
me
a
little
further
i
promise
you
that
i
ll
only
risk
one
more
failure
will
you
be
so
good
sir
ix
the
incident
of
the
partly
lifted
shade
the
fellow
had
a
way
with
him
hard
to
resist
cold
as
george
was
and
exhausted
by
an
excitement
of
a
kind
to
which
he
was
wholly
unaccustomed
he
found
himself
acceding
to
the
detective
s
request
and
after
a
quick
lunch
and
a
huge
cup
of
coffee
in
a
restaurant
which
i
wish
i
had
time
to
describe
the
two
took
a
car
which
eventually
brought
them
into
one
of
the
oldest
quarters
of
the
borough
of
brooklyn
the
sleet
which
had
stung
their
faces
in
the
streets
of
new
york
had
been
left
behind
them
somewhere
on
the
bridge
but
the
chill
was
not
gone
from
the
air
and
george
felt
greatly
relieved
when
sweetwater
paused
in
the
middle
of
a
long
block
before
a
lofty
tenement
house
of
mean
appearance
and
signified
that
here
they
were
to
stop
and
that
from
now
on
mum
was
to
be
their
watchword
george
was
relieved
i
say
but
he
was
also
more
astonished
than
ever
what
kind
of
haunts
were
these
for
the
cultured
gentleman
who
spent
his
evenings
at
the
clermont
it
was
easy
enough
in
these
days
of
extravagant
sympathies
to
understand
such
a
man
addressing
the
uneasy
spirits
of
lower
new
york
he
had
been
called
an
enthusiast
and
an
enthusiast
is
very
often
a
social
agitator
but
to
trace
him
afterwards
to
a
place
like
this
was
certainly
a
surprise
a
tenement
such
a
tenement
as
this
meant
home
home
for
himself
or
for
those
he
counted
his
friends
and
such
a
supposition
seemed
inconceivable
to
my
poor
husband
with
the
memory
of
the
gorgeous
parlour
of
the
clermont
in
his
mind
indeed
he
hinted
something
of
the
kind
to
his
affable
but
strangely
reticent
companion
but
all
the
answer
he
got
was
a
peculiar
smile
whose
humorous
twist
he
could
barely
discern
in
the
of
the
open
doorway
into
which
they
had
just
plunged
an
adventure
certainly
an
adventure
flashed
through
poor
george
s
mind
as
he
peered
in
great
curiosity
down
the
long
hall
before
him
into
a
dismal
rear
opening
into
a
still
more
dismal
court
it
was
truly
a
novel
experience
for
a
business
man
whose
philanthropy
was
carried
on
entirely
by
proxy
that
is
by
his
wife
should
he
be
expected
to
penetrate
into
those
dark
recesses
or
would
he
be
led
up
the
long
flights
of
naked
stairs
so
feebly
illuminated
that
they
gave
the
impression
of
extending
indefinitely
into
dimmer
and
dimmer
heights
of
decay
and
desolation
sweetwater
seemed
to
decide
for
the
rear
for
leaving
george
he
stepped
down
the
hall
into
the
court
beyond
where
george
could
see
him
casting
inquiring
glances
up
at
the
walls
above
him
another
tenement
similar
to
the
one
whose
rear
end
he
was
contemplating
towered
behind
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
that
he
was
satisfied
with
the
look
he
had
given
and
came
quickly
back
joining
george
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
up
which
he
silently
led
the
way
it
was
a
rude
building
but
it
seemed
respectable
enough
and
very
quiet
considering
the
mass
of
people
it
accommodated
there
were
marks
of
poverty
everywhere
but
no
squalor
one
flight
two
flights
three
and
then
george
s
guide
stopped
and
looking
back
at
him
made
a
gesture
it
appeared
to
be
one
of
caution
but
when
the
two
came
together
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
sweetwater
spoke
quite
naturally
as
he
pointed
out
a
door
in
their
rear
that
s
the
room
we
ll
keep
a
sharp
watch
and
when
any
man
no
matter
what
his
dress
or
appearance
comes
up
these
stairs
and
turns
that
way
give
him
a
sharp
look
you
understand
yes
oh
he
hasn
t
come
in
yet
i
took
pains
to
find
that
out
you
saw
me
go
into
the
court
and
look
up
that
was
to
see
if
his
window
was
lighted
well
it
wasn
george
felt
but
surely
said
he
the
gentleman
named
brotherson
doesn
t
live
the
inventor
oh
and
but
i
will
explain
the
suppressed
excitement
contained
in
these
words
made
george
stare
indeed
he
had
been
wondering
for
some
time
at
the
manner
of
the
detective
which
showed
a
curious
mixture
of
several
opposing
emotions
now
the
fellow
was
actually
in
a
tremble
of
hope
or
impatience
and
not
content
with
listening
he
peered
every
few
minutes
down
the
well
of
the
staircase
and
when
he
was
not
doing
that
tramped
from
end
to
end
of
the
narrow
separating
the
head
of
the
stairs
from
the
door
he
had
pointed
out
like
one
to
whom
minutes
were
hours
all
this
time
he
seemed
to
forget
george
who
certainly
had
as
much
reason
as
himself
for
finding
the
time
long
but
when
after
some
half
hour
of
this
tedium
and
suspense
there
rose
from
below
the
faint
clatter
of
ascending
footsteps
he
remembered
his
meek
companion
and
beckoning
him
to
one
side
began
a
studied
conversation
with
him
showing
him
a
in
which
he
had
written
such
phrases
as
these
don
t
look
up
till
he
is
fairly
in
range
with
the
light
there
s
nothing
to
fear
he
doesn
t
know
either
of
us
if
it
is
a
face
you
have
seen
before
if
it
is
the
one
we
are
expecting
to
see
pull
your
necktie
straight
it
s
a
little
on
one
side
these
rather
startling
injunctions
were
read
by
george
with
no
very
perceptible
diminution
of
the
uneasiness
which
it
was
only
natural
for
him
to
feel
at
the
oddity
of
his
position
but
only
the
demand
last
made
produced
any
impression
on
him
the
man
they
were
waiting
for
was
no
further
up
than
the
second
floor
but
instinctively
george
s
hand
had
flown
to
his
necktie
and
he
was
only
stopped
from
its
premature
by
a
warning
look
from
sweetwater
not
unless
you
know
him
whispered
the
detective
and
immediately
launched
out
into
an
easy
talk
about
some
totally
different
business
which
george
neither
understood
nor
was
expected
to
i
dare
say
suddenly
the
steps
below
paused
and
george
heard
sweetwater
draw
in
his
breath
in
irrepressible
dismay
but
they
were
immediately
resumed
and
presently
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
workingman
of
uncommon
proportions
appeared
in
sight
on
the
stairway
george
cast
him
a
keen
look
and
his
hand
rose
doubtfully
to
his
neck
and
then
fell
back
again
the
approaching
man
was
tall
very
and
easy
of
carriage
but
the
face
such
of
it
as
could
be
seen
between
his
cap
and
the
high
collar
he
had
pulled
up
about
his
ears
conveyed
no
exact
impression
to
george
s
mind
and
he
did
not
dare
to
give
the
signal
sweetwater
expected
from
him
yet
as
the
man
went
by
with
a
dark
and
sidelong
glance
at
them
both
he
felt
his
hand
rise
again
though
he
did
not
complete
the
action
much
to
his
own
disgust
and
to
the
evident
disappointment
of
the
watchful
detective
you
re
not
sure
he
now
heard
oddly
interpolated
in
the
stream
of
talk
with
which
the
other
endeavoured
to
carry
off
the
situation
george
shook
his
head
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
old
impression
he
had
formed
of
the
man
in
the
snow
mr
dunn
a
word
with
you
suddenly
spoke
up
sweetwater
to
the
man
who
had
just
passed
them
that
s
your
name
isn
t
it
yes
that
is
my
name
was
the
quiet
response
in
a
voice
which
was
at
once
rich
and
resonant
a
voice
which
george
knew
the
voice
of
the
impassioned
speaker
he
had
heard
resounding
through
the
sleet
as
he
cowered
within
hearing
in
the
shed
behind
the
avenue
a
tenement
who
are
you
who
wish
to
speak
to
me
at
so
late
an
hour
he
was
returning
to
them
from
the
door
he
had
unlocked
and
left
slightly
ajar
well
we
are
you
know
what
smiled
the
ready
detective
advancing
to
greet
him
we
re
not
members
of
the
associated
brotherhood
but
possibly
have
hopes
of
being
so
at
all
events
we
should
like
to
talk
the
matter
over
if
as
you
say
it
s
not
too
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
club
but
you
spoke
before
then
you
can
give
us
some
sort
of
an
idea
how
we
are
to
apply
for
dunn
met
the
concentrated
gaze
of
his
two
evidently
unwelcome
visitors
with
a
frankness
which
dashed
george
s
confidence
in
himself
but
made
little
visible
impression
upon
his
daring
companion
i
should
rather
see
you
at
another
time
said
he
but
his
hesitation
was
inappreciable
save
to
the
nicest
ear
if
you
will
allow
me
to
be
brief
i
will
tell
you
what
i
know
which
is
very
sweetwater
was
greatly
taken
aback
all
he
had
looked
for
as
he
was
careful
to
tell
my
husband
later
was
a
sufficiently
prolonged
conversation
to
enable
george
to
mark
and
study
the
workings
of
the
face
he
was
not
yet
sure
of
nor
did
the
detective
feel
quite
easy
at
the
readiness
of
his
reception
nor
any
too
well
pleased
to
accept
the
invitation
which
this
man
now
gave
them
to
enter
his
room
but
he
suffered
no
betrayal
of
his
misgivings
to
escape
him
though
he
was
careful
to
intimate
to
george
as
they
waited
in
the
doorway
for
the
other
to
light
up
that
he
should
not
be
displeased
at
his
refusal
to
accompany
him
further
in
this
adventure
and
even
advised
him
to
remain
in
the
hall
till
he
received
his
summons
to
enter
but
george
had
not
come
as
far
as
this
to
back
out
now
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
sweetwater
advance
into
the
now
interior
he
advanced
too
and
began
to
look
around
him
the
room
like
many
others
in
these
tenements
had
a
jog
just
where
the
door
was
so
that
on
entering
they
had
to
take
several
steps
before
they
could
get
a
full
glimpse
of
its
four
walls
when
they
did
both
showed
surprise
comfort
if
not
elegance
confronted
them
which
impression
however
was
immediately
lost
in
the
evidences
of
work
manual
as
well
as
intellectual
which
were
everywhere
scattered
about
the
man
who
lived
here
was
not
only
a
student
as
was
evinced
by
a
long
wall
full
of
books
but
he
was
an
a
musician
an
inventor
and
an
athlete
so
much
could
be
learned
from
the
most
cursory
glance
a
more
careful
one
picked
up
other
facts
fully
as
startling
and
impressive
the
books
were
choice
the
invention
to
all
appearance
a
practical
one
the
art
of
a
high
order
and
the
music
such
as
was
in
view
of
a
character
of
which
the
nicest
taste
need
not
be
ashamed
george
began
to
feel
quite
conscious
of
the
intrusion
of
which
they
had
been
guilty
and
was
amazed
at
the
ease
with
which
the
detective
carried
himself
in
the
presence
of
such
manifestations
of
culture
and
good
hard
work
he
was
trying
to
recall
the
exact
appearance
of
the
figure
he
had
seen
stooping
in
the
snowy
street
two
nights
before
when
he
found
himself
staring
at
the
occupant
of
the
room
who
had
taken
up
his
stand
before
them
and
was
regarding
them
while
they
were
regarding
the
room
he
had
thrown
aside
his
hat
and
rid
himself
of
his
overcoat
and
the
fearlessness
of
his
aspect
seemed
to
daunt
the
hitherto
dauntless
sweetwater
who
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
perhaps
hunted
in
vain
for
words
with
which
to
start
conversation
had
he
made
an
awful
mistake
was
this
dunn
what
he
seemed
an
unknown
and
careful
genius
battling
with
great
odds
in
his
honest
struggle
to
give
the
world
something
of
value
in
return
for
what
it
had
given
him
the
quick
almost
deprecatory
glance
he
darted
at
george
betrayed
his
dismay
a
dismay
which
george
had
begun
to
share
notwithstanding
his
growing
belief
that
the
man
s
face
was
not
wholly
unknown
to
him
even
if
he
could
not
recognise
it
as
the
one
he
had
seen
outside
the
clermont
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
your
errand
came
in
quiet
if
not
sarcasm
from
their
patiently
waiting
host
it
s
the
room
muttered
sweetwater
with
an
attempt
at
his
ease
which
was
not
as
fully
successful
as
usual
what
an
genius
you
must
be
i
never
saw
the
like
and
in
a
tenement
house
too
you
ought
to
be
in
one
of
those
big
new
studio
buildings
in
new
york
where
artists
be
and
everything
you
see
is
beautiful
you
d
appreciate
it
you
the
detective
started
george
started
at
the
gleam
which
answered
him
from
a
very
uncommon
eye
it
was
a
temporary
flash
however
and
quickly
veiled
and
the
tone
in
which
this
dunn
now
spoke
was
anything
but
an
encouraging
one
i
thought
you
were
desirous
of
joining
a
socialistic
fraternity
said
he
a
true
aspirant
for
such
honours
don
t
care
for
beautiful
things
unless
all
can
have
them
i
prefer
my
tenement
how
is
it
with
you
friends
sweetwater
found
some
sort
of
a
reply
though
the
thing
which
this
man
now
did
must
have
startled
him
as
it
certainly
did
george
they
were
so
grouped
that
a
table
quite
full
of
anomalous
objects
stood
at
the
back
of
their
host
and
consequently
quite
beyond
their
own
reach
as
sweetwater
began
to
speak
he
whom
he
had
addressed
by
the
name
of
dunn
drew
a
pistol
from
his
breast
pocket
and
laid
it
down
barrel
towards
them
on
this
table
top
then
he
looked
up
courteously
enough
and
listened
till
sweetwater
was
done
a
very
handsome
man
but
one
not
to
be
trifled
with
in
the
slightest
degree
both
recognised
this
fact
and
george
for
one
began
to
edge
towards
the
door
now
i
feel
easier
remarked
the
giant
swelling
out
his
chest
he
was
unusually
tall
as
well
as
unusually
muscular
i
never
like
to
carry
arms
but
sometimes
it
is
unavoidable
damn
it
what
hands
he
was
looking
at
his
own
which
certainly
showed
soil
will
you
pardon
me
he
pleasantly
apologised
stepping
towards
a
washstand
and
plunging
his
hands
into
the
basin
i
can
not
think
with
dirt
on
me
like
that
humph
hey
did
you
speak
he
turned
quickly
on
george
who
had
certainly
uttered
an
ejaculation
but
receiving
no
reply
went
on
with
his
task
completing
it
with
a
care
and
a
disregard
of
their
presence
which
showed
him
up
in
still
another
light
but
even
his
hardihood
showed
shock
when
upon
turning
round
with
a
brisk
now
i
m
ready
to
talk
he
encountered
again
the
clear
eye
of
sweetwater
for
in
the
person
of
this
none
too
welcome
intruder
he
saw
a
very
different
man
from
the
one
upon
whom
he
had
just
turned
his
back
with
so
little
ceremony
and
there
appeared
to
be
no
good
reason
for
the
change
he
had
not
noted
in
his
preoccupation
how
george
at
sight
of
his
stooping
figure
had
made
a
sudden
significant
movement
and
if
he
had
the
pulling
of
a
necktie
straight
would
have
meant
nothing
to
him
but
to
sweetwater
it
meant
every
thing
and
it
was
in
the
tone
of
one
fully
at
ease
with
himself
that
he
now
dryly
remarked
mr
brotherson
if
you
feel
quite
clean
and
if
you
have
sufficiently
warmed
yourself
i
would
suggest
that
we
start
out
at
once
unless
you
prefer
to
have
me
share
this
room
with
you
till
the
there
was
silence
dunn
thus
addressed
attempted
no
answer
not
for
a
full
minute
the
two
men
were
measuring
each
other
george
felt
that
he
did
not
count
at
all
and
they
were
quite
too
much
occupied
with
this
task
to
heed
the
passage
of
time
to
george
who
knew
little
if
anything
of
what
this
silent
struggle
meant
to
either
it
seemed
that
the
detective
stood
no
show
before
this
samson
of
physical
strength
and
intellectual
power
backed
by
a
pistol
just
within
reach
of
his
hand
but
as
george
continued
to
look
and
saw
the
figure
of
the
smaller
man
gradually
dilate
while
that
of
the
larger
the
more
potent
and
the
better
guarded
gave
unmistakable
signs
of
secret
wavering
he
slowly
changed
his
mind
and
ranging
himself
with
the
detective
waited
for
the
word
or
words
which
should
explain
this
situation
and
render
intelligible
the
triumph
gradually
becoming
visible
in
the
young
detective
s
eyes
but
he
was
not
destined
to
have
his
curiosity
satisfied
so
far
he
might
witness
and
hear
but
it
was
long
before
he
understood
brotherson
repeated
their
host
after
the
silence
had
lasted
to
the
why
do
you
call
me
that
because
it
is
your
you
called
me
dunn
a
minute
that
is
why
dunn
if
brotherson
is
my
name
because
you
spoke
under
the
name
of
dunn
at
the
meeting
and
if
i
don
t
mistake
that
is
the
name
by
which
you
are
known
and
you
by
what
name
are
you
known
it
is
late
to
ask
isn
t
it
but
i
m
willing
to
speak
it
now
and
i
might
not
have
been
so
a
little
earlier
in
our
conversation
i
am
detective
sweetwater
of
the
new
york
department
of
police
and
my
errand
here
is
a
very
simple
one
some
letters
signed
by
you
have
been
found
among
the
papers
of
the
lady
whose
mysterious
death
at
the
hotel
clermont
is
just
now
occupying
the
attention
of
the
new
york
authorities
if
you
have
any
information
to
give
which
will
in
any
way
explain
that
death
your
presence
will
be
welcome
at
coroner
heath
s
office
in
new
york
if
you
have
not
your
presence
will
still
be
welcome
at
all
events
i
was
told
to
bring
you
you
will
be
on
hand
to
accompany
me
in
the
morning
i
am
quite
sure
pardoning
the
unconventional
means
i
have
taken
to
make
sure
of
my
man
the
humour
with
which
this
was
said
seemed
to
rob
it
of
anything
like
attack
and
brotherson
as
we
shall
hereafter
call
him
smiled
with
an
odd
acceptance
of
the
same
as
he
responded
i
will
go
before
the
police
certainly
i
haven
t
much
to
tell
but
what
i
have
is
at
their
service
it
will
not
help
you
but
i
have
no
secrets
what
are
you
doing
he
bounded
towards
sweetwater
who
had
simply
stepped
to
the
window
lifted
the
shade
and
looked
across
at
the
opposing
tenement
i
wanted
to
see
if
it
was
still
snowing
explained
the
detective
with
a
smile
which
seemed
to
strike
the
other
like
a
blow
if
it
was
a
liberty
please
pardon
brotherson
drew
back
the
cold
air
of
which
he
now
assumed
presented
such
a
contrast
to
the
unwarranted
heat
of
the
moment
before
that
george
wondered
greatly
over
it
and
later
when
he
recapitulated
to
me
the
whole
story
of
this
night
it
was
this
incident
of
the
lifted
shade
together
with
the
emotion
it
had
caused
which
he
acknowledged
as
being
for
him
the
most
inexplicable
event
of
the
evening
and
the
one
he
was
most
anxious
to
hear
explained
as
this
ends
our
connection
with
this
affair
i
will
bid
you
my
personal
farewell
i
have
often
wished
that
circumstances
had
made
it
possible
for
me
to
accompany
you
through
the
remaining
intricacies
of
this
remarkable
case
but
you
will
not
lack
a
suitable
guide
book
ii
as
seen
by
detective
sweetwater
x
a
difference
of
opinion
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
sweetwater
stood
before
the
coroner
s
desk
urging
a
plea
he
feared
to
hear
refused
he
wished
to
be
present
at
the
interview
soon
to
be
held
with
brotherson
and
he
had
no
good
reason
to
advance
why
such
a
privilege
should
be
allotted
him
it
s
not
curiosity
said
he
there
s
a
question
i
hope
to
see
settled
i
can
t
communicate
it
you
would
laugh
at
me
but
it
s
an
important
one
a
very
important
one
and
i
beg
that
you
will
let
me
sit
in
one
of
the
corners
and
hear
what
he
says
i
won
t
bother
and
i
ll
be
very
still
so
still
that
he
ll
hardly
notice
me
do
grant
me
this
favour
the
coroner
who
had
had
some
little
experience
with
this
man
surveyed
him
with
a
smile
less
forbidding
than
the
poor
fellow
expected
you
seem
to
lay
great
store
by
it
said
he
if
you
want
to
sort
those
papers
over
there
you
thank
you
i
don
t
understand
the
job
but
i
promise
you
not
to
increase
the
confusion
if
i
do
if
i
rattle
the
leaves
too
loudly
it
will
mean
press
him
further
on
this
exact
point
but
i
doubt
if
i
rattle
them
sir
no
such
the
last
three
words
were
uttered
sotto
voce
but
the
coroner
heard
him
and
followed
his
ungainly
figure
with
a
glance
of
some
curiosity
as
he
settled
himself
at
the
desk
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
is
the
man
he
began
but
at
this
moment
the
man
entered
and
heath
forgot
the
young
detective
in
his
interest
in
the
new
arrival
neither
dressed
with
the
elegance
known
to
the
habitues
of
the
clermont
nor
yet
in
the
workman
s
outfit
in
which
he
had
thought
best
to
appear
before
the
associated
brotherhood
the
newcomer
advanced
with
an
aspect
of
open
respect
which
could
not
fail
to
make
a
favourable
impression
upon
the
critical
eye
of
the
official
awaiting
him
so
favourable
indeed
was
this
impression
that
that
gentleman
half
rose
infusing
a
little
more
consideration
into
his
greeting
than
he
was
accustomed
to
show
to
his
prospective
witnesses
such
a
fearless
eye
he
had
seldom
encountered
nor
was
it
often
his
pleasure
to
confront
so
conspicuous
a
specimen
of
physical
and
intellectual
manhood
mr
brotherson
i
believe
said
he
as
he
motioned
his
visitor
to
sit
that
is
my
name
orlando
brotherson
the
same
i
m
glad
we
have
made
no
mistake
smiled
the
doctor
mr
brotherson
i
have
sent
for
you
under
the
supposition
that
you
were
a
friend
of
the
unhappy
lady
lately
dead
at
the
hotel
miss
challoner
certainly
miss
i
knew
the
lady
but
here
the
speaker
s
eye
took
on
a
look
as
questioning
as
that
of
his
interlocutor
but
in
a
way
so
devoid
of
all
publicity
that
i
can
not
but
feel
surprised
that
the
fact
should
be
at
this
the
listening
sweetwater
hoped
that
heath
would
ignore
the
suggestion
thus
conveyed
and
decline
the
explanation
it
apparently
demanded
but
the
impression
made
by
the
gentleman
s
good
looks
had
been
too
strong
for
this
coroner
s
proverbial
caution
and
handing
over
the
slip
of
a
note
which
had
been
found
among
miss
challoner
s
effects
by
her
father
he
quietly
asked
do
you
recognise
the
signature
yes
it
is
then
you
acknowledge
yourself
the
author
of
these
lines
most
certainly
have
i
not
said
that
this
is
my
signature
do
you
remember
the
words
of
this
note
brotherson
hardly
i
recollect
its
tenor
but
not
the
exact
read
excuse
me
i
had
rather
not
i
am
aware
that
they
were
bitter
and
should
be
the
cause
of
great
regret
i
was
angry
when
i
wrote
that
is
evident
but
the
cause
of
your
anger
is
not
so
clear
brotherson
miss
challoner
was
a
woman
of
lofty
character
or
such
was
the
universal
opinion
of
her
friends
what
could
she
have
done
to
a
gentleman
like
yourself
to
draw
forth
such
a
tirade
you
ask
that
i
am
obliged
to
there
is
mystery
surrounding
her
death
the
kind
of
mystery
which
demands
perfect
frankness
on
the
part
of
all
who
were
near
her
on
that
evening
or
whose
relations
to
her
were
in
any
way
peculiar
you
acknowledge
that
your
friendship
was
of
such
a
guarded
nature
that
it
surprised
you
greatly
to
hear
it
recognised
yet
you
could
write
her
a
letter
of
this
nature
why
because
the
word
came
glibly
but
the
next
one
was
long
in
following
because
he
repeated
letting
the
fire
of
some
strong
feeling
disturb
for
a
moment
his
dignified
reserve
i
offered
myself
to
miss
challoner
and
she
dismissed
me
with
great
ah
and
so
you
thought
a
threat
was
due
her
a
threat
these
words
contain
a
threat
do
they
not
they
may
i
was
hardly
master
of
myself
at
the
time
i
may
have
expressed
myself
in
an
unfortunate
read
the
words
brotherson
i
really
must
insist
that
you
do
there
was
no
hesitancy
now
rising
he
leaned
over
the
table
and
read
the
few
words
the
other
had
spread
out
for
his
perusal
then
he
slowly
rose
to
his
full
height
as
he
answered
with
some
slight
display
of
compunction
i
remember
it
perfectly
now
it
is
not
a
letter
to
be
proud
of
i
hope
pray
finish
that
you
are
not
seeking
to
establish
a
connection
between
this
letter
and
her
violent
death
letters
of
this
sort
are
often
very
mischievous
brotherson
the
harshness
with
which
this
is
written
might
easily
rouse
emotions
of
a
most
unhappy
nature
in
the
breast
of
a
woman
as
sensitive
as
miss
pardon
me
heath
i
can
not
flatter
myself
so
far
you
overrate
my
influence
with
the
lady
you
you
believe
then
that
she
was
sincere
in
her
rejection
of
your
addresses
a
start
too
slight
to
be
noted
by
any
one
but
the
watchful
sweetwater
showed
that
this
question
had
gone
home
but
the
and
mental
control
of
this
man
were
perfect
and
in
an
instant
he
was
facing
the
coroner
again
with
a
dignity
which
gave
no
clew
to
the
disturbance
into
which
his
thoughts
had
just
been
thrown
nor
was
this
disturbance
apparent
in
his
tones
when
he
made
his
reply
i
have
never
allowed
myself
to
think
otherwise
i
have
seen
no
reason
why
i
should
the
suggestion
you
would
convey
by
such
a
question
is
hardly
welcome
now
i
pray
you
to
be
careful
in
your
judgment
of
such
a
woman
s
impulses
they
often
spring
from
sources
not
to
be
sounded
even
by
her
dearest
just
but
how
cold
heath
eyeing
him
with
admiration
rather
than
sympathy
hesitated
how
to
proceed
while
sweetwater
peering
up
from
his
papers
sought
in
vain
for
some
evidence
of
the
bereaved
lover
in
the
impressive
but
wholly
dispassionate
figure
of
him
who
had
just
spoken
had
pride
got
the
better
of
his
heart
or
had
that
organ
always
been
subordinate
to
the
will
in
this
man
of
instincts
so
varying
that
at
one
time
he
impressed
you
simply
as
a
typical
gentleman
of
leisure
at
another
as
no
more
than
a
fiery
agitator
with
powers
absorbed
by
if
not
limited
to
the
one
cause
he
advocated
and
again
and
this
seemed
the
most
contradictory
of
all
just
the
ardent
inventor
living
in
a
tenement
with
science
for
his
goddess
and
work
always
under
his
hand
as
the
young
detective
weighed
these
possibilities
and
marvelled
over
the
contradictions
they
offered
he
forgot
the
papers
now
lying
quiet
under
his
hand
he
was
too
interested
to
remember
his
own
part
something
which
could
not
often
be
said
of
sweetwater
meantime
the
coroner
had
collected
his
thoughts
with
an
apology
for
the
extremely
personal
nature
of
his
inquiry
he
asked
brotherson
if
he
would
object
to
giving
him
some
further
details
of
his
acquaintanceship
with
miss
challoner
where
he
first
met
her
and
under
what
circumstances
their
friendship
had
developed
not
at
all
was
the
ready
reply
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
in
the
matter
i
only
wish
that
her
father
were
present
that
he
might
listen
to
the
recital
of
my
acquaintanceship
with
his
daughter
he
might
possibly
understand
her
better
and
regard
with
more
leniency
the
presumption
into
which
i
was
led
by
my
ignorance
of
the
pride
inherent
in
great
your
wish
can
very
easily
be
gratified
returned
the
official
pressing
an
electric
button
on
his
desk
mr
challoner
is
in
the
adjoining
then
as
the
door
communicating
with
the
room
he
had
mentioned
swung
ajar
and
stood
so
heath
added
without
apparent
consciousness
of
the
dramatic
character
of
this
episode
you
will
not
need
to
raise
your
voice
beyond
its
natural
pitch
he
can
hear
perfectly
from
where
he
thank
you
i
am
glad
to
speak
in
his
presence
came
in
undisturbed
from
this
not
easily
surprised
witness
i
shall
relate
the
facts
exactly
as
they
occurred
adding
nothing
and
concealing
nothing
if
i
mistook
my
position
or
miss
challoner
s
position
it
is
not
for
me
to
apologise
i
never
hid
my
business
from
her
nor
the
moderate
extent
of
my
fortune
if
she
knew
me
at
all
she
knew
me
for
what
i
am
a
man
of
the
people
who
glories
in
work
and
who
has
risen
by
it
to
a
position
somewhat
unique
in
this
city
i
feel
no
lack
of
equality
even
with
such
a
woman
as
miss
a
most
unnecessary
preamble
no
doubt
and
of
doubtful
efficacy
in
smoothing
his
way
to
a
correct
understanding
with
the
deeply
bereaved
father
but
he
looked
so
handsome
as
he
thus
asserted
himself
and
made
so
much
of
his
inches
and
the
noble
poise
of
his
head
though
cold
of
eye
and
always
cold
of
manner
that
those
who
saw
as
well
as
heard
him
forgave
this
display
of
egotism
in
consideration
of
its
honesty
and
the
dignity
it
imparted
to
his
person
i
first
met
miss
challoner
in
the
berkshires
he
began
after
a
moment
of
quiet
listening
for
any
possible
sound
from
the
other
room
i
had
been
on
the
tramp
and
had
stopped
at
one
of
the
great
hotels
for
a
seven
days
rest
i
will
acknowledge
that
i
chose
this
spot
at
the
instigation
of
a
relative
who
knew
my
tastes
and
how
perfectly
they
might
be
gratified
there
that
i
should
mingle
with
the
guests
may
not
have
been
in
his
thought
any
more
than
it
was
in
mine
at
the
beginning
of
my
stay
the
panorama
of
beauty
spread
out
before
me
on
every
side
was
sufficient
in
itself
for
my
enjoyment
and
might
have
continued
so
to
the
end
if
my
attention
had
not
been
very
forcibly
drawn
on
one
memorable
morning
to
a
young
lady
miss
challoner
by
the
very
earnest
look
she
gave
me
as
i
was
crossing
the
office
from
one
verandah
to
another
i
must
insist
on
this
look
even
if
it
shock
the
delicacy
of
my
listeners
for
without
the
interest
it
awakened
in
me
i
might
not
have
noticed
the
blush
with
which
she
turned
aside
to
join
her
friends
on
the
verandah
it
was
an
overwhelming
blush
which
could
not
have
sprung
from
any
slight
embarrassment
and
though
i
hate
the
pretensions
of
those
egotists
who
see
in
a
woman
s
smile
more
than
it
by
right
conveys
i
could
not
help
being
moved
by
this
display
of
feeling
in
one
so
gifted
with
every
grace
and
attribute
of
the
perfect
woman
with
less
caution
than
i
usually
display
i
approached
the
desk
where
she
had
been
standing
and
meeting
the
eyes
of
the
clerk
asked
the
young
lady
s
name
he
gave
it
and
waited
for
me
to
express
the
surprise
he
expected
it
to
evoke
but
i
felt
none
and
showed
none
other
feelings
had
seized
me
i
had
heard
of
this
gracious
woman
from
many
sources
in
my
life
among
the
suffering
masses
of
new
york
and
now
that
i
had
seen
her
and
found
her
to
be
not
only
my
ideal
of
personal
loveliness
but
seemingly
approachable
and
not
uninterested
in
myself
i
allowed
my
fancy
to
soar
and
my
heart
to
become
touched
a
fact
which
the
clerk
now
confided
to
me
naturally
deepened
the
impression
miss
challoner
had
seen
my
name
in
the
and
asked
to
have
me
pointed
out
to
her
perhaps
she
had
heard
my
name
spoken
in
the
same
quarter
where
i
had
heard
hers
we
have
never
exchanged
confidences
on
the
subject
and
i
can
not
say
i
can
only
give
you
my
reason
for
the
interest
i
felt
in
miss
challoner
and
why
i
forgot
in
the
glamour
of
this
episode
the
aims
and
purposes
of
a
not
unambitious
life
and
the
distance
which
the
world
and
the
aristocratic
class
put
between
a
woman
of
her
wealth
and
standing
and
a
simple
worker
like
myself
i
must
be
pardoned
she
had
smiled
upon
me
once
and
she
smiled
again
days
before
we
were
formally
presented
i
caught
her
softened
look
turned
my
way
as
we
passed
each
other
in
hall
or
corridor
we
were
friends
or
so
it
appeared
to
me
before
ever
a
word
passed
between
us
and
when
fortune
favoured
us
and
we
were
duly
introduced
our
minds
met
in
a
strange
sympathy
which
made
this
one
interview
a
memorable
one
to
me
unhappily
as
i
then
considered
it
this
was
my
last
day
at
the
hotel
and
our
conversation
interrupted
frequently
by
passing
acquaintances
was
never
resumed
i
exchanged
a
few
words
with
her
by
way
of
but
nothing
more
i
came
to
new
york
and
she
remained
in
lenox
a
month
after
and
she
too
came
to
new
this
do
you
remember
it
the
exact
language
i
mean
i
do
it
made
a
great
impression
on
me
i
shall
hope
for
our
further
acquaintance
she
said
we
have
one
very
strong
interest
in
and
if
ever
a
human
face
spoke
eloquently
it
was
hers
at
that
moment
the
interest
as
i
understood
it
was
our
mutual
sympathy
for
our
toiling
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
lower
streets
of
this
city
but
the
eloquence
that
i
probably
mistook
i
thought
it
sprang
from
personal
interest
and
it
gave
me
courage
to
pursue
the
intention
which
had
taken
the
place
of
every
other
feeling
and
ambition
by
which
i
had
hitherto
been
moved
here
was
a
woman
in
a
thousand
one
who
could
make
a
man
of
me
indeed
if
she
could
ignore
the
social
gulf
between
us
i
felt
free
to
take
the
leap
cowardice
had
never
been
a
fault
of
mine
but
i
was
no
fool
even
then
i
realised
that
i
must
first
let
her
see
the
manner
of
man
i
was
and
what
life
meant
to
me
and
must
mean
to
her
if
the
union
i
contemplated
should
become
an
actual
fact
i
wrote
letters
to
her
but
i
did
not
give
her
my
address
or
even
request
a
reply
i
was
not
ready
for
any
word
from
her
i
am
not
like
other
men
and
i
could
wait
and
i
did
for
weeks
then
i
suddenly
appeared
at
her
the
change
of
voice
the
bitterness
which
he
infused
into
this
final
sentence
made
every
one
look
up
hitherto
he
had
spoken
calmly
almost
monotonously
as
if
no
present
responded
to
this
tale
of
vanished
love
but
with
the
words
then
i
suddenly
appeared
at
her
hotel
he
showed
himself
human
again
and
betrayed
a
passion
which
though
curbed
was
of
the
fiery
quality
befitting
his
extraordinary
attributes
of
mind
and
person
this
was
when
put
in
heath
anxious
to
bridge
the
pause
which
must
have
been
very
painful
to
the
listening
father
the
week
after
thanksgiving
i
did
not
see
her
the
first
day
and
only
casually
the
second
but
she
knew
i
was
in
the
building
and
when
i
came
upon
her
one
evening
seated
at
the
very
desk
in
the
mezzanine
which
we
all
have
such
bitter
cause
to
remember
i
could
not
forbear
expressing
myself
in
a
way
she
could
not
misunderstand
the
result
was
of
a
kind
to
drive
a
man
like
myself
to
an
extremity
of
and
rage
she
rose
up
as
if
insulted
and
flung
me
one
sentence
and
one
sentence
only
before
she
hailed
the
elevator
and
left
my
presence
a
cur
could
not
have
been
dismissed
with
less
that
is
not
like
my
daughter
what
was
the
sentence
you
allude
to
let
me
hear
the
very
challoner
had
come
forward
and
now
stood
awaiting
his
reply
a
dignified
but
pathetic
figure
which
all
must
view
with
respect
i
hate
the
memory
of
them
but
since
you
demand
it
i
will
repeat
them
just
as
they
fell
from
her
lips
was
brotherson
s
bitter
retort
she
said
you
of
all
men
should
recognise
the
unseemliness
of
these
proposals
had
your
letters
given
me
any
hint
of
the
feelings
you
have
just
expressed
you
would
never
have
had
this
opportunity
of
approaching
that
was
all
but
her
indignation
was
scathing
ladies
who
have
supped
exclusively
off
silver
show
a
fine
scorn
for
the
common
ware
of
the
challoner
bowed
there
is
some
mistake
said
he
my
daughter
might
be
averse
to
your
addresses
but
she
would
never
show
indignation
to
any
aspirant
for
her
hand
simply
on
account
of
extraneous
conditions
she
had
wide
sympathies
wider
than
i
often
approved
something
in
your
conduct
or
the
confidence
you
showed
shocked
her
nicer
sense
not
your
lack
of
the
luxuries
she
often
misprised
this
much
i
feel
obliged
to
say
out
of
justice
to
her
character
which
was
uniformly
you
have
seen
her
with
men
of
her
own
world
and
yours
was
the
harsh
response
she
had
another
side
to
her
nature
for
the
man
of
a
different
sphere
and
it
killed
my
love
that
you
can
see
and
led
to
my
sending
her
the
injudicious
letter
with
which
you
have
confronted
me
the
hurt
bull
utters
one
bellow
before
he
dies
i
bellowed
and
bellowed
loudly
but
i
did
not
die
i
m
my
own
man
still
and
mean
to
remain
the
assertive
boldness
some
would
call
it
bravado
with
which
he
thus
finished
the
story
of
his
relations
with
the
dead
heiress
seemed
to
be
more
than
challoner
could
stand
with
a
look
of
extreme
pain
and
perplexity
he
vanished
from
the
doorway
and
it
fell
to
heath
to
inquire
is
this
letter
a
letter
of
threat
you
will
remember
the
only
communication
which
passed
between
you
and
miss
challoner
after
this
unfortunate
passage
of
arms
at
the
clermont
yes
i
had
no
wish
to
address
her
again
i
had
exhausted
in
this
one
outburst
whatever
humiliation
i
and
she
did
she
give
no
sign
make
you
no
answer
none
then
as
if
he
found
it
impossible
to
hide
this
hurt
to
his
pride
she
did
not
even
seem
to
consider
me
worthy
the
honour
of
an
added
rebuke
such
arrogance
is
no
doubt
commendable
in
a
this
time
his
bitterness
did
not
pass
unrebuked
by
the
coroner
remember
the
grey
hairs
of
the
only
challoner
who
can
hear
you
and
respect
his
brotherson
bowed
i
have
finished
said
he
i
shall
have
nothing
more
to
say
on
the
and
he
drew
himself
up
in
expectation
of
the
dismissal
he
evidently
thought
pending
but
the
coroner
was
not
done
with
him
by
any
means
he
had
a
theory
in
regard
to
this
lamentable
suicide
which
he
hoped
to
establish
by
this
man
s
testimony
and
in
pursuit
of
this
plan
he
not
only
motioned
to
brotherson
to
reseat
himself
but
began
at
once
to
open
a
fresh
line
of
examination
by
saying
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
press
this
matter
i
have
been
given
to
understand
that
notwithstanding
your
break
with
miss
challoner
you
have
kept
up
your
visits
to
the
clermont
and
were
even
on
the
spot
at
the
time
of
her
on
the
spot
in
the
hotel
i
there
you
are
right
i
was
in
the
at
the
time
of
her
death
very
near
the
time
i
remember
hearing
some
disturbance
in
the
lobby
behind
me
just
as
i
was
passing
out
at
the
broadway
you
did
and
did
not
return
why
should
i
return
i
am
not
a
man
of
much
curiosity
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
connect
a
sudden
alarm
in
the
lobby
of
the
clermont
with
any
cause
of
special
interest
to
this
was
so
true
and
the
look
which
accompanied
the
words
was
so
frank
that
the
coroner
hesitated
a
moment
before
he
said
certainly
not
unless
well
to
be
direct
unless
you
had
just
seen
miss
challoner
and
knew
her
state
of
mind
and
what
was
likely
to
follow
your
abrupt
i
had
no
interview
with
miss
but
you
saw
her
saw
her
that
evening
and
just
before
the
accident
sweetwater
s
papers
rattled
it
was
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
in
that
moment
of
silence
then
what
do
you
mean
by
those
words
inquired
brotherson
with
studied
composure
i
have
said
that
i
had
no
interview
with
miss
challoner
why
do
you
ask
me
then
if
i
saw
her
because
i
believe
that
you
did
from
a
distance
possibly
but
yet
directly
and
with
no
possibility
of
do
you
put
that
as
a
question
i
do
did
you
see
her
figure
or
face
that
night
i
nothing
not
even
the
rattling
of
sweetwater
s
papers
disturbed
the
silence
which
followed
this
admission
from
where
heath
asked
at
last
from
a
point
far
enough
away
to
make
any
communication
between
us
impossible
i
do
not
think
you
will
require
me
to
recall
the
exact
if
it
were
one
which
made
it
possible
for
her
to
see
you
as
clearly
as
you
could
see
her
i
think
it
would
be
very
advisable
for
you
to
say
it
was
such
a
then
i
think
i
can
locate
it
for
you
or
do
you
prefer
to
locate
it
yourself
i
will
locate
it
myself
i
had
hoped
not
to
be
called
upon
to
mention
what
i
can
not
but
consider
a
most
unfortunate
coincidence
as
a
gentleman
you
will
understand
my
reticence
and
also
why
it
is
a
matter
of
regret
to
me
that
with
an
acumen
worthy
of
your
position
you
should
have
discovered
a
fact
which
while
it
can
not
explain
miss
challoner
s
death
will
drag
our
little
affair
before
the
public
and
possibly
give
it
a
prominence
in
some
minds
which
i
am
sure
does
not
belong
to
it
i
met
miss
challoner
s
eye
for
one
instant
from
the
top
of
the
little
staircase
running
up
to
the
mezzanine
i
had
yielded
thus
far
to
an
impulse
i
had
frequently
combated
to
seek
by
another
interview
to
retrieve
the
bad
effect
which
must
have
been
made
upon
her
by
my
angry
note
i
knew
that
she
frequently
wrote
letters
in
the
mezzanine
at
this
hour
and
got
as
far
as
the
top
of
the
staircase
in
my
effort
to
join
her
but
got
no
further
when
i
saw
her
on
her
feet
with
her
face
turned
my
way
i
remembered
the
scorn
with
which
she
had
received
my
former
proposals
and
without
taking
another
step
forward
i
turned
away
from
her
and
fled
down
the
steps
and
so
out
of
the
building
by
the
main
entrance
she
saw
me
for
her
hand
flew
up
with
a
startled
gesture
but
i
can
not
think
that
my
presence
on
the
same
floor
with
her
could
have
caused
her
to
strike
the
blow
which
terminated
her
life
why
should
i
no
woman
sacrifices
her
life
out
of
mere
regret
for
the
disdain
she
has
shown
a
man
she
has
taken
no
pains
to
his
tone
and
his
attitude
seemed
to
invite
the
concurrence
of
heath
in
this
statement
but
the
richness
of
the
one
and
the
grace
of
the
other
showed
the
handsome
speaker
off
to
such
advantage
that
the
coroner
was
rather
inclined
to
consider
how
a
woman
even
of
miss
challoner
s
fine
taste
and
careful
breeding
might
see
in
such
a
situation
much
for
regret
if
not
for
active
despair
and
the
suicidal
act
he
gave
no
evidence
of
his
thought
however
but
followed
up
the
one
admission
made
by
brotherson
which
he
and
others
must
naturally
view
as
of
the
first
importance
you
saw
miss
challoner
lift
her
hand
you
say
which
hand
and
what
was
in
it
anything
she
lifted
her
right
hand
but
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you
whether
there
was
anything
in
it
or
not
i
simply
saw
the
movement
before
i
turned
away
it
looked
like
one
of
alarm
to
me
i
felt
that
she
had
some
reason
for
this
she
could
not
know
that
it
was
in
repentance
i
came
rather
than
in
fulfilment
of
my
a
sigh
from
the
adjoining
room
brotherson
rose
as
he
heard
it
and
in
doing
so
met
the
clear
eye
of
sweetwater
fixed
upon
his
own
its
language
was
no
doubt
peculiar
and
it
seemed
to
fascinate
him
for
a
moment
for
he
started
as
if
to
approach
the
detective
but
forsook
this
intention
almost
immediately
and
addressing
the
coroner
gravely
remarked
her
death
following
so
quickly
upon
this
abortive
attempt
of
mine
at
an
interview
startled
me
by
its
coincidence
as
much
as
it
does
you
if
in
the
weakness
of
her
woman
s
nature
it
was
more
than
this
if
the
scorn
she
had
previously
shown
me
was
a
cloak
she
instinctively
assumed
to
hide
what
she
was
not
ready
to
disclose
my
remorse
will
be
as
great
as
any
one
here
could
wish
but
the
proof
of
all
this
will
have
to
be
very
convincing
before
my
present
convictions
will
yield
to
it
some
other
and
more
poignant
source
will
have
to
be
found
for
that
instant
s
impulsive
act
than
is
supplied
by
this
story
of
my
unfortunate
heath
was
convinced
but
he
was
willing
to
concede
something
to
the
secret
demand
made
upon
him
by
sweetwater
who
was
bundling
up
his
papers
with
much
clatter
looking
up
with
a
smile
which
had
elements
in
it
he
was
hardly
conscious
of
perhaps
himself
he
asked
in
an
way
then
why
did
you
take
such
pains
to
wash
your
hands
of
the
affair
the
moment
you
had
left
the
hotel
i
do
not
you
passed
around
the
corner
into
street
did
you
not
very
likely
i
could
go
that
way
as
well
as
and
stopped
at
the
first
oh
i
see
someone
saw
that
childish
action
of
what
did
you
mean
by
it
just
what
you
have
suggested
i
did
go
through
the
pantomime
of
washing
my
hands
of
an
affair
i
considered
definitely
ended
i
had
resisted
an
irrepressible
impulse
to
see
and
talk
with
miss
challoner
again
and
was
pleased
with
my
firmness
unaware
of
the
tragic
blow
which
had
just
fallen
i
was
full
of
at
my
escape
from
the
charm
which
had
lured
me
back
to
this
hotel
again
and
again
in
spite
of
my
better
judgment
and
i
wished
to
symbolise
my
relief
by
an
act
of
which
i
was
in
another
moment
ashamed
strange
that
there
should
have
been
a
witness
to
it
here
he
stole
a
look
at
sweetwater
stranger
still
that
circumstances
by
the
most
extraordinary
of
coincidences
should
have
given
so
unforeseen
a
point
to
you
are
right
brotherson
the
whole
occurrence
is
startling
and
most
strange
but
life
is
made
up
of
the
unexpected
as
none
know
better
than
we
physicians
whether
our
practice
be
of
a
public
or
private
as
brotherson
left
the
room
the
curiosity
to
which
he
had
yielded
once
before
led
him
to
cast
a
glance
of
penetrating
inquiry
behind
him
full
at
sweetwater
and
if
either
felt
embarrassment
it
was
not
the
hunted
but
the
hunter
but
the
feeling
did
not
last
i
ve
simply
met
the
strongest
man
i
ve
ever
encountered
was
sweetwater
s
encouraging
comment
to
himself
all
the
more
glory
if
i
can
find
a
joint
in
his
armour
or
a
hidden
passage
to
his
cold
secretive
xi
alike
in
essentials
mr
gryce
i
am
either
a
fool
or
the
luckiest
fellow
going
you
must
decide
the
aged
detective
thus
addressed
laid
down
his
evening
paper
and
endeavoured
to
make
out
the
dim
form
he
could
just
faintly
discern
standing
between
him
and
the
library
door
sweetwater
is
that
you
no
one
else
sweetwater
the
fool
or
sweetwater
much
too
wise
for
his
own
good
i
don
t
know
which
perhaps
you
can
find
out
and
tell
a
grunt
from
the
region
of
the
library
table
then
the
sarcastic
remark
i
m
just
in
the
mood
to
settle
that
question
this
last
failure
to
my
account
ought
to
make
me
an
excellent
judge
of
another
s
folly
i
ve
meddled
with
the
old
business
for
the
last
time
sweetwater
you
ll
have
to
go
it
lone
from
now
on
the
department
has
no
more
work
for
ebenezar
gryce
or
rather
ebenezar
gryce
will
make
no
more
fool
attempts
to
please
them
strange
that
a
man
don
t
know
when
his
time
has
come
to
quit
i
remember
low
i
once
scored
yeardsley
for
hanging
on
after
he
had
lost
his
grip
and
here
am
i
doing
the
same
thing
but
what
s
the
matter
with
you
speak
out
my
boy
something
new
in
the
wind
no
gryce
nothing
new
it
s
the
same
old
business
but
if
what
i
suspect
is
true
this
same
old
business
offers
opportunities
for
some
very
interesting
and
unusual
effort
you
re
not
satisfied
with
the
coroner
s
verdict
in
the
challoner
case
no
i
m
satisfied
with
nothing
that
leaves
all
ends
dangling
suicide
was
not
proved
it
seemed
the
only
presumption
possible
but
it
was
not
proved
there
was
no
on
that
nor
any
evidence
that
it
had
ever
been
no
i
m
not
proud
of
the
chain
which
lacks
a
link
where
it
should
be
we
shall
never
supply
that
i
quite
agree
with
that
chain
we
must
throw
and
forge
another
sweetwater
approached
and
sat
down
yes
i
believe
we
can
do
it
yet
i
have
only
one
indisputable
fact
for
a
starter
that
is
why
i
want
you
to
tell
me
whether
i
m
growing
daft
or
simply
adventurous
gryce
i
don
t
trust
brotherson
he
has
pulled
the
wool
over
heath
s
eyes
and
almost
over
those
of
challoner
but
he
can
t
pull
it
over
mine
though
he
should
tell
a
story
ten
times
more
plausible
than
the
one
with
which
he
has
satisfied
the
coroner
s
jury
i
would
still
listen
to
him
with
more
misgiving
than
confidence
yet
i
have
caught
him
in
no
misstatement
and
his
eye
is
steadier
than
my
own
perhaps
it
is
simply
a
deeply
rooted
antipathy
on
my
part
or
the
rage
one
feels
at
finding
he
has
placed
his
finger
on
the
wrong
man
again
it
may
be
what
sweetwater
a
distrust
gryce
i
m
going
to
ask
you
a
ask
away
ask
fifty
if
you
want
no
the
one
may
involve
fifty
but
it
is
big
enough
in
itself
to
hold
our
attention
for
a
while
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
case
before
that
in
some
of
its
details
was
similar
to
this
no
it
stands
alone
that
s
why
it
is
so
you
forget
the
wealth
beauty
and
social
consequence
of
the
present
victim
has
blinded
you
to
the
strong
resemblance
which
her
case
bears
to
one
you
know
in
which
the
sufferer
had
none
of
the
worldly
advantages
of
miss
challoner
i
allude
to
wait
the
washerwoman
in
hicks
street
sweetwater
what
have
you
got
up
your
sleeve
you
do
mean
that
brooklyn
washerwoman
don
t
you
the
same
the
department
may
have
forgotten
it
but
i
haven
t
gryce
there
s
a
startling
similarity
in
the
two
cases
if
you
study
the
essential
features
only
startling
i
assure
yes
you
are
right
there
but
what
if
there
is
we
were
no
more
successful
in
solving
that
case
than
we
have
been
in
solving
this
yet
you
look
and
act
like
a
hound
which
has
struck
a
hot
the
young
man
smoothed
his
features
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
i
shall
never
learn
said
he
not
to
give
tongue
till
the
hunt
is
fairly
started
if
you
will
excuse
me
we
ll
first
make
sure
of
the
similarity
i
have
mentioned
then
i
ll
explain
myself
i
have
some
notes
here
made
at
the
time
it
was
decided
to
drop
the
hicks
street
case
as
a
wholly
inexplicable
one
as
you
know
i
never
can
bear
to
say
die
and
i
sometimes
keep
such
notes
as
a
possible
help
in
case
any
such
unfinished
matter
should
come
up
again
shall
i
read
them
do
twenty
years
ago
it
would
not
have
been
necessary
i
should
have
remembered
every
detail
of
an
affair
so
puzzling
but
my
memory
is
no
longer
entirely
reliable
so
fire
away
my
boy
though
i
hardly
see
your
purpose
or
what
real
bearing
the
affair
in
hicks
street
has
upon
the
clermont
one
a
poor
washerwoman
and
the
wealthy
miss
challoner
true
they
were
not
unlike
in
their
the
connection
will
come
later
smiled
the
young
detective
with
that
strange
softening
of
his
features
which
made
one
at
times
forget
his
extreme
plainness
i
m
sure
you
will
not
consider
the
time
lost
if
i
ask
you
to
consider
the
comparison
i
am
about
to
make
if
only
as
a
curiosity
in
criminal
and
he
read
on
the
afternoon
of
december
fourth
the
strong
and
persistent
screaming
of
a
young
child
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
a
rear
tenement
in
hicks
street
brooklyn
drew
the
attention
of
some
of
the
inmates
and
led
them
after
several
ineffectual
efforts
to
gain
an
entrance
to
the
breaking
in
of
the
door
which
had
been
fastened
on
the
inside
by
an
the
tenant
whom
all
knew
for
an
honest
woman
had
not
infrequently
fastened
her
door
in
this
manner
in
order
to
safeguard
her
child
who
was
abnormally
active
and
had
a
way
of
rattling
the
door
open
when
it
was
not
thus
secured
but
she
had
never
refused
to
open
before
and
the
child
s
cries
were
pitiful
this
was
no
longer
a
matter
of
wonder
when
the
door
having
been
wrenched
from
its
hinges
they
all
rushed
in
across
a
tub
of
steaming
clothes
lifted
upon
a
bench
in
the
open
window
they
saw
the
body
of
this
good
woman
lying
inert
and
seemingly
dead
the
frightened
child
tugging
at
her
skirts
she
was
of
a
robust
make
fleshy
and
fair
and
had
always
been
considered
a
model
of
health
and
energy
but
at
the
sight
of
her
helpless
figure
thus
stricken
while
at
work
the
one
cry
was
a
stroke
till
she
had
been
lifted
off
and
laid
upon
the
floor
then
some
discoloration
in
the
water
at
the
bottom
of
the
tub
led
to
a
closer
examination
of
her
body
and
the
discovery
of
a
in
her
breast
directly
over
the
heart
as
she
had
been
standing
with
face
towards
the
window
all
crowded
that
way
to
see
where
the
shot
had
come
from
as
they
were
on
the
fourth
storey
it
could
not
have
come
from
the
court
upon
which
the
room
looked
it
could
only
have
come
from
the
front
tenement
towering
up
before
them
some
twenty
feet
away
a
single
window
of
the
innumerable
ones
confronting
them
stood
open
and
this
was
the
one
directly
opposite
nobody
was
to
be
seen
there
or
in
the
room
beyond
but
during
the
excitement
one
man
ran
off
to
call
the
police
and
another
to
hunt
up
the
janitor
and
ask
who
occupied
this
room
his
reply
threw
them
all
into
confusion
the
tenant
of
that
room
was
the
best
the
quietest
and
most
respectable
man
in
either
building
then
he
must
be
simply
careless
and
the
shot
an
accidental
one
a
rush
was
made
for
the
stairs
and
soon
the
whole
building
was
in
an
uproar
but
when
this
especial
room
was
reached
it
was
found
locked
and
on
the
door
a
paper
pinned
up
on
which
these
words
were
written
gone
to
new
york
will
be
back
at
words
that
recalled
a
circumstance
to
the
janitor
he
had
seen
the
gentleman
go
out
an
hour
before
this
terminated
all
inquiry
in
this
direction
though
some
few
of
the
excited
throng
were
for
battering
down
this
door
just
as
they
had
the
other
one
but
they
were
overruled
by
the
janitor
who
saw
no
use
in
such
wholesale
destruction
and
presently
the
arrival
of
the
police
restored
order
and
limited
the
inquiry
to
the
rear
building
where
it
undoubtedly
mr
gryce
here
sweetwater
laid
by
his
notes
that
he
might
address
the
old
gentleman
more
directly
i
was
with
the
boys
when
they
made
their
first
official
investigation
this
is
why
you
can
rely
upon
the
facts
as
here
given
i
followed
the
investigation
closely
and
missed
nothing
which
could
in
any
way
throw
light
on
the
case
it
was
a
mysterious
one
from
the
first
and
lost
nothing
by
further
inquiry
into
the
details
the
first
fact
to
startle
us
as
we
made
our
way
up
through
the
crowd
which
blocked
halls
and
staircases
was
this
a
doctor
had
been
found
and
though
he
had
been
forbidden
to
make
more
than
a
cursory
examination
of
the
body
till
the
coroner
came
he
had
not
hesitated
to
declare
after
his
first
look
that
the
wound
had
not
been
made
by
a
bullet
but
by
some
sharp
and
slender
weapon
thrust
home
by
a
powerful
hand
you
mark
that
mr
gryce
as
this
seemed
impossible
in
face
of
the
fact
that
the
door
had
been
found
buttoned
on
the
inside
we
did
not
give
much
credit
to
his
opinion
and
began
our
work
under
the
obvious
theory
of
an
accidental
discharge
of
some
gun
from
one
of
the
windows
across
the
court
but
the
doctor
was
nearer
right
than
we
supposed
when
the
coroner
came
to
look
into
the
matter
he
discovered
that
the
wound
was
not
only
too
small
to
have
been
made
by
the
ordinary
bullet
but
that
there
was
no
bullet
to
be
found
in
the
woman
s
body
or
anywhere
else
her
heart
had
been
reached
by
a
thrust
and
not
by
a
shot
from
a
gun
gryce
have
you
not
heard
a
startling
repetition
of
this
report
in
a
case
nearer
at
hand
but
to
go
back
this
discovery
so
important
if
true
was
as
yet
that
is
at
the
time
of
our
entering
the
room
limited
to
the
declaration
of
an
irresponsible
physician
but
the
possibility
it
involved
was
of
so
astonishing
a
nature
that
it
influenced
us
unconsciously
in
our
investigation
and
led
us
almost
immediately
into
a
consideration
of
the
difficulties
attending
an
entrance
into
as
well
as
an
escape
from
a
room
situated
as
this
was
up
three
flights
from
the
court
with
no
communication
with
the
adjoining
rooms
save
through
a
door
guarded
on
both
sides
by
heavy
pieces
of
furniture
no
one
person
could
handle
the
hall
door
buttoned
on
the
inside
and
the
some
fifteen
feet
to
the
left
this
room
of
death
appeared
to
be
as
removed
from
the
approach
of
a
murderous
outsider
as
the
spot
in
the
of
the
clermont
where
miss
challoner
fell
otherwise
the
place
presented
the
greatest
contrast
possible
to
that
scene
of
splendour
and
comfort
i
had
not
entered
the
clermont
at
that
time
and
no
such
comparison
could
have
struck
my
mind
but
i
have
thought
of
it
since
and
you
with
your
experience
will
not
find
it
difficult
to
picture
the
room
where
this
poor
woman
lived
and
worked
bare
walls
with
just
a
newspaper
illustration
pinned
up
here
and
there
a
bed
tragically
occupied
at
this
moment
a
kitchen
stove
on
which
a
boiler
with
steaming
clothes
still
bubbled
and
foamed
an
old
bureau
a
large
pine
wardrobe
against
an
inner
door
which
we
later
found
to
have
been
locked
for
months
and
the
key
lost
some
chairs
and
most
pronounced
of
all
because
of
its
position
directly
before
the
window
a
pine
bench
supporting
a
of
the
old
sort
as
it
was
here
the
woman
fell
this
tub
naturally
received
the
closest
examination
a
board
projected
from
its
further
side
whither
it
had
evidently
been
pushed
by
the
weight
of
her
falling
body
and
from
its
top
hung
a
wet
cloth
marking
with
its
lugubrious
drip
on
the
boards
beneath
the
first
heavy
moments
of
silence
which
is
the
natural
accompaniment
of
so
serious
a
survey
on
the
floor
to
the
right
lay
a
cake
of
soap
just
as
it
had
slipped
from
her
hand
the
window
was
closed
for
the
temperature
was
at
the
but
it
had
been
found
up
and
it
was
put
up
now
to
show
the
height
at
which
it
had
then
stood
as
we
all
took
our
look
at
the
house
wall
opposite
a
sound
of
shouting
came
up
from
below
a
dozen
children
were
sliding
on
barrel
staves
down
a
slope
of
snow
they
had
been
engaged
in
this
sport
all
the
afternoon
and
were
our
witnesses
later
that
no
one
had
made
a
hazardous
escape
by
means
of
the
ladder
of
the
running
as
i
have
said
at
an
almost
unattainable
distance
towards
the
left
of
her
own
child
whose
cries
had
roused
the
neighbours
nothing
was
to
be
seen
the
woman
in
the
extreme
rear
had
carried
it
off
to
her
room
but
when
we
came
to
see
it
later
no
doubt
was
felt
by
any
of
us
that
this
child
was
too
young
to
talk
connectedly
nor
did
i
ever
hear
that
it
ever
said
anything
which
could
in
any
way
guide
investigation
and
that
is
as
far
as
we
ever
got
the
coroner
s
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
death
by
means
of
a
stab
from
some
unknown
weapon
in
the
hand
of
a
person
also
unknown
but
no
weapon
was
ever
found
nor
was
it
ever
settled
how
the
attack
could
have
been
made
or
the
murderer
escape
under
the
conditions
described
the
woman
was
poor
her
friends
few
and
the
case
seemingly
inexplicable
so
after
creating
some
excitement
by
its
peculiarities
it
fell
of
its
own
weight
but
i
remembered
it
and
in
many
a
spare
hour
have
tried
to
see
my
way
through
the
it
presented
but
quite
in
vain
the
road
is
as
blind
as
ever
but
here
sweetwater
s
face
sharpened
and
his
eyes
burned
as
he
leaned
closer
and
closer
to
the
older
detective
but
this
second
case
so
unlike
the
first
in
but
so
exactly
like
it
in
just
those
points
which
make
the
mystery
has
dropped
a
thread
from
its
tangled
skein
into
my
hand
which
may
yet
lead
us
to
the
heart
of
both
can
you
guess
have
you
guessed
what
this
thread
is
but
how
could
you
without
the
one
clew
i
have
not
given
you
gryce
the
tenement
where
this
occurred
is
the
same
i
visited
the
other
night
in
search
of
brotherson
and
the
man
characterised
at
that
time
by
the
janitor
as
the
best
the
quietest
and
most
respectable
tenant
in
the
whole
building
and
the
one
you
remember
whose
window
opened
directly
opposite
the
spot
where
this
woman
lay
dead
was
dunn
himself
or
in
other
words
our
late
redoubtable
witness
orlando
xii
gryce
finds
an
antidote
for
old
age
i
thought
i
should
make
you
sit
up
i
really
calculated
upon
doing
so
sir
yes
i
have
established
the
plain
fact
that
this
brotherson
was
near
to
if
not
in
the
exact
line
of
the
scene
of
crime
in
each
of
these
extraordinary
and
baffling
cases
a
very
odd
coincidence
is
it
not
was
the
dry
conclusion
of
our
eager
young
detective
odd
enough
if
you
are
correct
in
your
statement
but
i
thought
it
was
conceded
that
the
man
brotherson
was
not
personally
near
was
not
even
in
the
building
at
the
time
of
the
woman
s
death
in
hicks
street
that
he
was
out
and
had
been
out
for
hours
according
to
the
and
so
the
janitor
thought
but
he
didn
t
quite
know
his
man
i
m
not
sure
that
i
do
but
i
mean
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
make
it
thoroughly
before
i
let
him
go
the
hero
well
i
will
say
the
possible
hero
of
two
such
adventures
deserves
some
attention
from
one
so
interested
in
the
abnormal
as
sweetwater
how
came
you
to
discover
that
dunn
of
this
ramshackle
tenement
in
hicks
street
was
identical
with
the
elegantly
equipped
admirer
of
miss
challoner
just
this
way
the
night
before
miss
challoner
s
death
i
was
brooding
very
deeply
over
the
hicks
street
case
it
had
so
possessed
me
that
i
had
taken
this
street
in
on
my
way
from
flatbush
as
if
staring
at
the
house
and
its
swarming
courtyard
was
going
to
settle
any
such
question
as
that
i
walked
by
the
place
and
i
looked
up
at
the
windows
no
inspiration
then
i
sauntered
back
and
entered
the
house
with
the
fool
intention
of
crossing
the
courtyard
and
wandering
into
the
rear
building
where
the
crime
had
occurred
but
my
attention
was
diverted
and
my
mind
changed
by
seeing
a
man
coming
down
the
stairs
before
me
of
so
fine
a
figure
that
i
involuntarily
stopped
to
look
at
him
had
he
moved
a
little
less
carelessly
had
he
worn
his
workman
s
clothes
a
little
less
naturally
i
should
have
thought
him
some
college
bred
man
out
on
a
slumming
expedition
but
he
was
entirely
too
much
at
home
where
he
was
and
too
unconscious
of
his
jeans
for
any
such
conclusion
on
my
part
and
when
he
had
passed
out
i
had
enough
curiosity
to
ask
who
he
was
my
interest
you
may
believe
was
in
no
wise
abated
when
i
learned
that
he
was
that
highly
respectable
tenant
whose
window
had
been
open
at
the
time
when
half
the
inmates
of
the
two
buildings
had
rushed
up
to
his
door
only
to
find
a
paper
on
it
displaying
these
words
gone
to
new
york
will
be
back
at
had
he
returned
at
that
hour
i
don
t
think
anybody
had
ever
asked
and
what
reason
had
i
for
such
interference
now
but
an
idea
once
planted
in
my
brain
sticks
tight
and
i
kept
thinking
of
this
man
all
the
way
to
the
bridge
instinctively
and
quite
against
my
will
i
found
myself
connecting
him
with
some
previous
remembrance
in
which
i
seemed
to
see
his
tall
form
and
strong
features
under
the
stress
of
some
great
excitement
but
there
my
memory
stopped
till
suddenly
as
i
was
entering
the
subway
it
all
came
back
to
me
i
had
met
him
the
day
i
went
with
the
boys
to
investigate
the
case
in
hicks
street
he
was
coming
down
the
staircase
of
the
rear
tenement
then
very
much
as
i
had
just
seen
him
coming
down
the
one
in
front
only
the
dunn
of
seemed
to
have
all
his
wits
about
him
while
the
huge
fellow
who
brushed
so
rudely
by
me
on
that
occasion
had
the
peculiar
look
of
a
man
struggling
with
horror
or
some
other
grave
agitation
this
was
not
surprising
of
course
under
the
circumstances
i
had
met
more
than
one
man
and
woman
in
those
halls
who
had
worn
the
same
look
but
none
of
them
had
put
up
a
sign
on
his
door
that
he
had
left
for
new
york
and
would
not
be
back
till
and
then
changed
his
mind
so
suddenly
that
he
was
back
in
the
tenement
at
three
sharing
the
curiosity
and
the
terrors
of
its
horrified
inmates
but
the
discovery
while
possibly
suggestive
was
not
of
so
pressing
a
nature
as
to
demand
instant
action
and
more
immediate
duties
coming
up
i
let
the
matter
slip
from
my
mind
to
be
brought
up
again
the
next
day
you
may
well
believe
when
all
the
circumstances
of
the
death
at
the
clermont
came
to
light
and
i
found
myself
confronted
by
a
problem
very
nearly
the
counterpart
of
the
one
then
occupying
me
but
i
did
not
see
any
real
connection
between
the
two
cases
until
in
my
hunt
for
brotherson
i
came
upon
the
following
facts
that
he
was
not
always
the
gentleman
he
appeared
that
the
apartment
in
which
he
was
supposed
to
live
was
not
his
own
but
a
friend
s
and
that
he
was
only
there
by
spells
when
he
was
there
he
dressed
like
a
prince
and
it
was
while
so
clothed
he
ate
his
meals
in
the
cafe
of
the
hotel
clermont
but
there
were
times
when
he
had
been
seen
to
leave
this
apartment
in
a
very
different
garb
and
while
there
was
no
one
to
insinuate
that
he
was
slack
in
paying
his
debts
or
was
given
to
dissipation
or
any
overt
vice
it
was
generally
conceded
by
such
as
casually
knew
him
that
there
was
a
mysterious
side
to
his
life
which
no
one
understood
his
friend
a
seemingly
candid
and
gentleman
explained
these
contradictions
by
saying
that
brotherson
was
a
humanitarian
and
spent
much
of
his
time
in
the
slums
that
while
so
engaged
he
naturally
dressed
to
suit
the
occasion
and
if
he
was
to
be
criticised
at
all
it
was
for
his
zeal
which
often
led
him
to
extremes
and
kept
him
to
his
task
for
days
during
which
time
none
of
his
friends
saw
him
then
this
enthusiastic
gentleman
called
him
the
great
intellectual
light
of
the
day
and
well
if
ever
i
want
a
character
i
shall
take
pains
to
insinuate
myself
into
the
good
graces
of
this
conway
of
brotherson
himself
i
saw
nothing
he
had
come
to
conway
s
apartment
the
night
before
the
night
of
miss
challoner
s
death
you
understand
but
had
remained
only
long
enough
to
change
his
clothes
where
he
went
afterwards
is
unknown
to
conway
nor
can
he
tell
us
when
to
look
for
his
return
when
he
does
show
up
my
message
will
be
given
him
etc
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
conway
but
i
had
an
idea
in
regard
to
this
elusive
brotherson
i
had
heard
enough
about
him
to
be
mighty
sure
that
together
with
his
other
accomplishments
he
possessed
the
golden
tongue
and
easy
speech
of
an
orator
also
that
his
tendencies
were
revolutionary
and
that
for
all
his
fine
clothes
and
hankering
after
table
luxuries
and
the
like
he
cherished
a
spite
against
wealth
which
made
his
words
under
certain
moods
cut
like
a
knife
but
there
was
another
man
known
to
us
of
the
precinct
who
had
very
nearly
these
same
gifts
and
this
man
was
going
to
speak
at
a
secret
meeting
that
very
evening
this
we
had
been
told
by
a
disgruntled
member
of
the
associated
brotherhood
suspecting
brotherson
i
had
this
prospective
speaker
described
and
thought
i
recognised
my
man
but
i
wanted
to
be
positive
in
my
identification
so
i
took
anderson
with
me
and
but
i
ll
cut
that
short
we
didn
t
see
the
orator
and
that
go
went
for
nothing
but
i
had
another
string
to
my
bow
in
the
shape
of
the
workman
dunn
who
also
answered
to
the
description
which
had
been
given
me
so
i
lugged
poor
anderson
over
into
hicks
street
it
was
late
for
the
visit
i
proposed
but
not
too
late
if
dunn
was
also
the
orator
who
surprised
by
a
raid
i
had
not
been
let
into
would
be
making
for
his
home
if
only
to
establish
an
alibi
the
subway
was
near
and
i
calculated
on
his
using
it
but
we
took
a
taxicab
and
so
arrived
in
hicks
street
some
few
minutes
before
him
the
result
you
know
anderson
recognised
the
man
as
the
one
whom
he
saw
washing
his
hands
in
the
snow
outside
of
the
clermont
and
the
man
seeing
himself
discovered
owned
himself
to
be
brotherson
and
made
no
difficulty
about
accompanying
us
the
next
day
to
the
coroner
s
office
you
have
heard
how
he
bore
himself
what
his
explanations
were
and
how
completely
they
fitted
in
with
the
preconceived
notions
of
the
inspector
and
the
district
attorney
in
consequence
miss
challoner
s
death
is
looked
upon
as
a
suicide
the
impulsive
act
of
a
woman
who
sees
the
man
she
may
have
scouted
but
whom
she
secretly
loves
turn
away
from
her
in
all
probability
forever
a
weapon
was
in
her
hand
she
impulsively
used
it
and
another
deplorable
suicide
was
added
to
the
melancholy
list
had
i
put
in
my
oar
at
the
conference
held
in
the
coroner
s
office
had
i
recalled
to
heath
the
curious
case
of
spotts
and
then
identified
brotherson
as
the
man
whose
window
fronted
hers
from
the
opposite
tenement
a
diversion
might
have
been
created
and
the
outcome
been
different
but
i
feared
the
experiment
i
m
not
sufficiently
in
with
the
chief
as
yet
nor
yet
with
the
inspector
they
might
not
have
called
me
a
fool
you
may
but
that
s
different
and
they
might
have
listened
but
it
would
doubtless
have
been
with
an
air
i
could
not
have
held
up
against
with
that
fellow
s
eyes
fixed
mockingly
on
mine
for
he
and
i
are
pitted
for
a
struggle
and
i
do
not
want
to
give
him
the
advantage
of
even
a
momentary
triumph
he
s
the
most
complete
master
of
himself
of
any
man
i
ever
met
and
it
will
take
the
united
brain
and
resolution
of
the
whole
force
to
bring
him
to
book
if
he
ever
is
brought
to
book
which
i
doubt
what
do
you
think
about
it
that
you
have
given
me
an
antidote
against
old
age
was
the
ringing
and
unexpected
reply
as
the
thoughtful
aspect
of
the
old
man
yielded
impulsively
to
a
burst
of
his
early
enthusiasm
if
we
can
get
a
good
grip
on
the
thread
you
speak
of
and
can
work
ourselves
along
by
it
though
it
be
by
no
more
than
an
inch
at
a
time
we
shall
yet
make
our
way
through
this
labyrinth
of
undoubted
crime
and
earn
for
ourselves
a
triumph
which
will
make
some
of
these
raw
and
inexperienced
young
fellows
about
us
stare
sweetwater
coincidences
are
possible
we
run
upon
them
every
day
but
coincidence
in
crime
that
should
make
work
for
a
detective
and
we
are
not
afraid
of
work
there
s
my
hand
for
my
end
of
the
and
here
s
next
minute
the
two
heads
were
closer
than
ever
together
and
the
business
had
begun
xiii
time
circumstance
and
a
villain
s
heart
our
first
difficulty
is
this
we
must
prove
motive
now
i
do
not
think
it
will
be
so
very
hard
to
show
that
this
brotherson
cherished
feelings
of
revenge
towards
miss
challoner
but
i
have
to
acknowledge
right
here
and
now
that
the
most
skillful
and
vigourous
pumping
of
the
janitor
and
such
other
tenants
of
the
hicks
street
tenement
as
i
have
dared
to
approach
fails
to
show
that
he
has
ever
held
any
communication
with
spotts
or
even
knew
of
her
existence
until
her
remarkable
death
attracted
his
attention
i
have
spent
all
the
afternoon
over
this
and
with
no
result
a
complete
break
in
the
chain
at
the
very
humph
we
will
set
that
down
then
as
so
much
against
the
next
and
this
is
a
bitter
pill
too
is
the
almost
insurmountable
difficulty
already
recognised
of
determining
how
a
man
without
approaching
his
victim
could
manage
to
inflict
a
mortal
stab
in
her
breast
no
cloak
of
complete
invisibility
has
yet
been
found
even
by
the
cleverest
true
the
problem
is
such
as
a
nightmare
offers
for
years
my
dreams
have
been
haunted
by
a
gnome
who
proposes
just
such
but
there
s
an
answer
to
everything
and
i
m
sure
there
s
an
answer
to
this
remember
his
business
he
s
an
inventor
with
startling
ideas
so
much
i
ve
seen
for
myself
you
may
stretch
probabilities
a
little
in
his
case
and
with
this
conceded
we
may
add
by
way
of
to
the
difficulties
you
mention
coincidences
of
time
and
circumstance
and
his
villainous
heart
oh
i
know
that
i
am
prejudiced
but
wait
and
see
miss
challoner
was
well
rid
of
him
even
at
the
cost
of
her
she
loved
him
even
her
father
believes
that
now
some
lately
discovered
letters
have
come
to
light
to
prove
that
she
was
by
no
means
so
heart
free
as
he
supposed
one
of
her
friends
it
seems
has
also
confided
to
him
that
once
while
she
and
miss
challoner
were
sitting
together
she
caught
miss
challoner
in
the
act
of
scribbling
capitals
over
a
sheet
of
paper
they
were
all
b
s
with
the
exception
of
here
and
there
a
neatly
turned
o
and
when
her
friend
twitted
her
with
her
fondness
for
these
two
letters
and
suggested
a
pleasing
monogram
miss
challoner
answered
o
b
transferring
the
letters
as
you
see
are
the
initials
of
the
finest
man
in
the
gosh
has
he
heard
this
story
who
the
gentleman
in
mr
brotherson
i
don
t
think
so
it
was
told
me
in
told
you
gryce
pardon
my
by
oh
by
he
is
greatly
distressed
at
having
the
disgraceful
suggestion
of
suicide
attached
to
his
daughter
s
name
notwithstanding
the
circumstances
notwithstanding
his
full
recognition
of
her
secret
predilection
for
a
man
of
whom
he
had
never
heard
till
the
night
of
her
death
he
can
not
believe
that
she
struck
the
blow
she
did
intentionally
he
sent
for
me
in
order
to
inquire
if
anything
could
be
done
to
reinstate
her
in
public
opinion
he
dared
not
insist
that
another
had
wielded
the
weapon
which
laid
her
low
so
suddenly
but
he
asked
if
in
my
experience
it
had
never
been
known
that
a
woman
to
some
strong
man
s
magnetic
influence
should
so
follow
his
thought
as
to
commit
an
act
which
never
could
have
arisen
in
her
own
mind
uninfluenced
he
evidently
does
not
like
brotherson
and
what
what
did
you
say
asked
sweetwater
with
a
halting
utterance
and
his
face
full
of
thought
i
simply
quoted
the
latest
authority
on
hypnotism
that
no
person
even
in
hypnotic
sleep
could
be
influenced
by
another
to
do
what
was
antagonistic
to
his
natural
latest
authority
that
doesn
t
mean
a
final
one
supposing
that
it
was
hypnotism
but
that
wouldn
t
account
for
spotts
death
her
wound
certainly
was
not
a
how
can
you
be
sure
there
was
no
weapon
found
in
the
room
or
in
the
court
the
snow
was
searched
and
the
children
too
no
weapon
gryce
not
even
a
besides
but
how
did
challoner
take
what
you
said
was
he
satisfied
with
this
assurance
he
had
to
be
i
didn
t
dare
to
hold
out
any
hope
based
on
so
unsubstantial
a
theory
but
the
interview
had
this
effect
upon
me
if
the
possibility
remains
of
fixing
guilt
elsewhere
than
on
miss
challoner
s
inconsiderate
impulse
i
am
ready
to
devote
any
amount
of
time
and
strength
to
the
work
to
see
this
grieving
father
relieved
from
the
worst
part
of
his
burden
is
worth
some
effort
and
now
you
know
why
i
have
listened
so
eagerly
to
you
sweetwater
i
will
go
with
you
to
the
superintendent
we
may
not
gain
his
attention
and
again
we
may
if
we
don
t
but
we
won
t
cross
that
bridge
prematurely
when
will
you
be
ready
for
this
business
i
must
be
at
headquarters
good
then
let
it
be
a
taxicab
sweetwater
the
subway
for
the
young
i
can
no
longer
manage
the
xiv
a
concession
it
is
true
there
seems
to
be
something
extraordinary
in
the
thus
brotherson
in
the
presence
of
the
inspector
but
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
he
easily
proceeded
i
knew
miss
challoner
and
i
have
already
said
how
much
and
how
little
i
had
to
do
with
her
death
the
other
woman
i
did
not
know
at
all
i
did
not
even
know
her
name
a
prosecution
based
on
grounds
so
flimsy
as
those
you
advance
would
savour
of
persecution
would
it
not
the
inspector
surprised
by
this
unexpected
attack
regarded
the
speaker
with
an
interest
rather
augmented
than
diminished
by
his
boldness
the
smile
with
which
he
had
uttered
these
concluding
words
yet
lingered
on
his
lips
lighting
up
features
of
a
mould
too
suggestive
of
command
to
be
associated
readily
with
guilt
that
the
impression
thus
produced
was
favourable
was
evident
from
the
tone
of
the
inspector
s
reply
we
have
said
nothing
about
prosecution
brotherson
we
hope
to
avoid
any
such
extreme
measures
and
that
we
may
the
more
readily
do
so
we
have
given
you
this
opportunity
to
make
such
explanations
as
the
situation
which
you
yourself
have
characterised
as
remarkable
seems
to
call
i
am
ready
but
what
am
i
called
upon
to
explain
i
really
can
not
see
sir
knowing
nothing
more
about
either
case
than
you
do
i
fear
that
i
shall
not
add
much
to
your
you
can
tell
us
why
with
your
seeming
culture
and
obvious
means
you
choose
to
spend
so
much
time
in
a
tenement
like
the
one
in
hicks
again
that
chill
smile
preceding
the
quiet
answer
have
you
seen
my
room
there
it
is
piled
to
the
ceiling
with
books
when
i
was
a
poor
man
i
chose
the
abode
suited
to
my
purse
and
my
passion
for
reading
as
i
grew
better
off
my
time
became
daily
more
valuable
i
have
never
seen
the
hour
when
i
felt
like
moving
that
precious
collection
besides
i
am
a
man
of
the
people
i
like
the
working
class
and
am
willing
to
be
thought
one
of
them
i
can
find
time
to
talk
to
a
mechanic
as
easily
as
to
such
members
of
the
moneyed
class
as
i
encounter
on
stray
evenings
at
the
hotel
clermont
i
have
led
i
may
say
that
i
am
leading
a
double
life
but
of
neither
am
i
ashamed
nor
have
i
cause
to
be
love
drove
me
to
ape
the
gentleman
in
the
halls
of
the
clermont
a
broad
human
interest
in
the
work
of
the
world
to
live
as
a
fellow
among
the
mechanics
of
hicks
but
why
make
use
of
one
name
as
a
gentleman
of
leisure
and
quite
a
different
one
as
the
honest
workman
ah
there
you
touch
upon
my
real
secret
i
have
a
reason
for
keeping
my
identity
quiet
till
my
invention
is
a
reason
connected
with
your
anarchistic
tendencies
but
the
word
was
uttered
in
a
way
to
carry
little
conviction
i
am
not
much
of
an
anarchist
he
now
took
the
trouble
to
declare
with
a
careless
lift
of
his
shoulders
i
like
fair
play
but
i
shall
never
give
you
much
trouble
by
my
manner
of
insuring
it
i
have
too
much
at
stake
my
invention
is
dearer
to
me
than
the
overthrow
of
present
institutions
nothing
must
stand
in
the
way
of
its
success
not
even
the
satisfaction
of
inspiring
terror
in
minds
shut
to
every
other
species
of
argument
i
have
uttered
my
last
speech
you
can
rely
on
me
for
we
are
glad
to
hear
it
dunn
physical
overthrow
carries
more
than
the
immediate
sufferer
with
if
this
were
meant
as
an
irritant
it
did
not
act
successfully
the
social
agitator
the
political
demagogue
the
orator
whose
honeyed
tones
had
rung
with
biting
invective
in
the
ears
of
the
united
brotherhood
of
the
awl
the
plane
and
the
trowel
simply
bowed
and
calmly
waited
for
the
next
attack
perhaps
it
was
of
a
nature
to
surprise
even
him
we
have
no
wish
continued
the
inspector
to
probe
too
closely
into
concerns
seemingly
quite
removed
from
the
main
issue
you
say
that
you
are
ready
nay
more
are
even
eager
to
answer
all
questions
you
will
probably
be
anxious
then
to
explain
away
a
discrepancy
between
your
word
and
your
conduct
which
has
come
to
our
attention
you
were
known
to
have
expressed
the
intention
of
spending
the
afternoon
of
spotts
death
in
new
york
and
were
supposed
to
have
done
so
yet
you
were
certainly
seen
in
the
crowd
which
invaded
that
rear
building
at
the
first
alarm
are
you
conscious
of
possessing
a
double
or
did
you
fail
to
cross
the
river
as
you
expected
to
i
am
glad
this
has
come
the
tone
was
one
of
which
would
have
shaken
sweetwater
sorely
had
he
been
admitted
to
this
unofficial
examination
i
have
never
confided
to
any
one
the
story
of
my
doings
on
that
unhappy
afternoon
because
i
knew
of
no
one
who
would
take
any
interest
in
them
but
this
is
what
occurred
i
did
mean
to
go
to
new
york
and
i
even
started
on
my
walk
to
the
bridge
at
the
hour
mentioned
but
i
got
into
a
small
crowd
on
the
corner
of
fulton
street
in
which
a
poor
devil
who
had
robbed
a
vendor
s
cart
of
a
few
oranges
was
being
hustled
about
there
was
no
policeman
within
sight
and
so
i
busied
myself
there
for
a
minute
paying
for
the
oranges
and
dragging
the
poor
wretch
away
into
an
alley
where
i
could
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
eat
them
when
i
came
out
of
the
alley
the
small
crowd
had
vanished
but
a
big
one
was
collecting
up
the
street
very
near
my
home
i
always
think
of
my
books
when
i
see
anything
suggesting
fire
and
naturally
i
returned
and
equally
naturally
when
i
heard
what
had
happened
followed
the
crowd
into
the
court
and
so
up
to
the
poor
woman
s
doorway
but
my
curiosity
satisfied
i
returned
at
once
to
the
street
and
went
to
new
york
as
i
had
do
you
mind
telling
us
where
you
went
in
new
york
not
at
all
i
went
shopping
i
wanted
a
certain
very
fine
wire
for
an
experiment
i
had
on
hand
and
i
found
it
in
a
little
shop
in
fourth
avenue
if
i
remember
rightly
the
name
over
the
door
was
grippus
its
oddity
struck
there
was
nothing
left
to
the
inspector
but
to
dismiss
him
he
had
answered
all
questions
willingly
and
with
a
countenance
inexpressive
of
guile
he
even
indulged
in
a
parting
shot
on
his
own
account
as
full
of
frank
acceptance
of
the
situation
as
it
was
fearless
in
its
attack
as
he
halted
in
the
doorway
before
turning
his
back
upon
the
room
he
smiled
for
the
third
time
as
he
quietly
said
i
have
ceased
visiting
my
friend
s
apartment
in
upper
new
york
if
you
ever
want
me
again
you
will
find
me
amongst
my
books
if
my
invention
halts
and
other
interests
stale
you
have
furnished
me
this
day
with
a
problem
which
can
not
fail
to
give
continual
occupation
to
my
energies
if
i
succeed
in
solving
it
first
i
shall
be
happy
to
share
my
knowledge
with
you
till
then
trust
the
laws
of
nature
no
man
when
once
on
the
outside
of
a
door
can
button
it
on
the
inside
nor
could
any
one
without
the
gift
of
complete
invisibility
make
a
leap
of
over
fifteen
feet
from
the
sill
of
a
fourth
story
window
on
to
an
adjacent
fire
escape
without
attracting
the
attention
of
some
of
the
many
children
playing
down
he
was
out
the
door
but
his
name
quickly
spoken
by
the
inspector
drew
him
back
anything
more
he
asked
the
inspector
smiled
you
are
a
man
of
considerable
analytic
power
as
i
take
it
brotherson
you
must
have
decided
long
ago
how
this
woman
is
that
a
question
inspector
you
may
take
it
as
then
i
will
allow
myself
to
say
that
there
is
but
one
view
to
take
of
the
matter
miss
challoner
s
death
was
due
to
suicide
so
was
that
of
the
washerwoman
but
there
i
stop
as
for
the
means
the
motive
such
mysteries
may
be
within
your
province
but
they
are
totally
outside
mine
god
help
us
all
the
world
is
full
of
misery
again
i
wish
you
the
air
seemed
to
have
lost
its
vitality
and
the
sun
its
sparkle
when
he
was
gone
now
what
do
you
think
gryce
the
old
man
rose
and
came
out
of
his
corner
this
that
i
m
up
against
the
hardest
proposition
of
my
lifetime
nothing
in
the
man
s
appearance
or
manner
evinces
guilt
yet
i
believe
him
guilty
i
must
not
to
is
to
strain
probability
to
the
point
of
breakage
but
how
to
reach
him
is
a
problem
and
one
of
no
ordinary
nature
years
ago
when
i
was
but
little
older
than
sweetwater
i
had
just
such
a
conviction
concerning
a
certain
man
against
whom
i
had
even
less
to
work
on
than
we
have
here
a
murder
had
been
committed
by
an
envenomed
spring
contained
in
a
toy
puzzle
i
worked
upon
the
conscience
of
the
suspect
in
that
case
by
bringing
constantly
before
his
eyes
a
facsimile
of
that
spring
it
met
him
in
the
folded
napkin
which
he
opened
at
his
restaurant
dinner
he
stumbled
upon
it
in
the
street
and
found
it
lying
amongst
his
papers
at
home
i
gave
him
no
relief
and
finally
he
succumbed
he
had
been
almost
driven
mad
by
remorse
but
this
man
has
no
conscience
if
he
is
not
innocent
as
the
day
he
s
as
hard
as
unquarried
marble
he
might
be
confronted
with
reminders
of
his
crime
at
every
turn
without
weakening
or
showing
by
loss
of
appetite
or
interrupted
sleep
any
effect
upon
his
nerves
that
s
my
opinion
of
the
gentleman
he
is
either
that
or
a
man
of
uncommon
force
and
i
m
inclined
to
believe
him
the
and
so
give
the
whole
matter
the
it
will
be
a
terrible
disappointment
to
that
s
and
to
that
s
different
i
m
disposed
to
consider
you
gryce
after
all
these
thank
you
i
have
done
the
state
some
what
do
you
want
you
say
the
mine
is
yes
in
a
day
or
in
a
week
possibly
in
a
month
but
persistence
and
a
protean
adaptability
to
meet
his
moods
might
accomplish
something
i
don
t
say
will
i
only
say
might
if
sweetwater
had
the
job
with
unlimited
time
in
which
to
carry
out
any
plan
he
may
have
or
even
for
a
change
of
plans
to
suit
a
changed
idea
success
might
be
his
and
both
time
effort
and
outlay
the
outlay
i
am
thinking
of
the
mr
challoner
will
see
to
that
i
have
his
word
that
no
reasonable
amount
will
daunt
but
this
brotherson
is
suspicious
he
has
an
inventor
s
secret
to
hide
if
none
other
we
can
t
saddle
him
with
a
guy
of
sweetwater
s
appearance
and
abnormal
not
readily
i
own
but
time
will
bring
counsel
are
you
willing
to
help
the
boy
to
help
me
and
possibly
yourself
by
this
venture
in
the
dark
the
department
shan
t
lose
money
by
it
that
s
all
i
can
but
it
s
a
big
one
gryce
you
shall
have
your
way
you
ll
be
the
only
loser
if
you
fail
and
you
will
fail
take
my
word
for
i
wish
i
could
speak
as
confidently
to
the
contrary
but
i
can
t
i
can
give
you
my
hand
though
inspector
and
sweetwater
s
thanks
i
can
meet
the
boy
now
an
hour
ago
i
didn
t
know
how
i
was
to
do
xv
that
s
the
question
how
many
times
has
he
seen
you
so
that
he
knows
your
face
and
figure
i
m
afraid
so
he
can
not
help
remembering
the
man
who
faced
him
in
his
own
that
s
damned
unfortunate
but
one
must
expect
some
sort
of
a
handicap
in
a
game
like
this
before
i
m
done
with
him
he
ll
look
me
full
in
the
face
and
wonder
if
he
s
ever
seen
me
before
i
wasn
t
always
a
detective
i
was
a
carpenter
once
as
you
know
and
i
ll
take
to
the
tools
again
as
soon
as
i
m
handy
with
them
i
ll
hunt
up
lodgings
in
hicks
street
he
may
suspect
me
at
first
but
he
won
t
long
i
ll
be
such
a
confounded
good
workman
i
only
wish
i
hadn
t
such
pronounced
features
they
ve
stood
awfully
in
my
way
gryce
i
don
t
like
to
talk
about
my
appearance
but
i
m
so
confounded
plain
that
people
remember
me
why
couldn
t
i
have
had
one
of
those
putty
faces
which
don
t
mean
anything
it
would
have
been
a
deuced
sight
more
you
ve
done
very
well
as
it
but
i
want
to
do
better
i
want
to
deceive
him
to
his
face
he
s
clever
this
same
brotherson
and
there
s
glory
to
be
got
in
making
a
fool
of
him
do
you
think
it
could
be
done
with
a
beard
i
ve
never
worn
a
beard
while
i
m
settling
back
into
my
old
trade
i
can
let
the
hair
do
it
ll
make
you
look
as
weak
as
water
it
ll
be
blonde
of
and
silky
and
straggling
charming
addition
to
my
beauty
but
it
ll
take
half
an
inch
off
my
nose
and
it
ll
cover
my
mouth
which
means
a
lot
in
my
case
then
my
complexion
it
must
be
changed
naturally
i
ll
consult
a
doctor
about
that
no
sort
of
will
go
with
this
man
if
my
eyes
look
weak
they
must
really
be
so
if
i
walk
slowly
and
speak
huskily
it
must
be
because
i
can
not
help
it
i
can
bear
the
slight
inconvenience
of
temporary
in
a
cause
like
this
and
if
necessary
the
cough
will
be
real
and
the
headache
positive
sweetwater
we
d
better
give
the
task
to
another
man
to
someone
brotherson
has
never
seen
and
won
t
be
suspicious
of
he
ll
be
suspicious
of
everybody
who
tries
to
make
friends
with
him
now
only
a
little
more
so
with
me
that
s
all
but
i
ve
got
to
meet
that
and
i
ll
do
it
by
being
temporarily
of
course
exactly
the
man
i
seem
my
health
will
not
be
good
for
the
next
few
weeks
i
m
sure
of
that
but
i
ll
be
a
model
workman
neat
and
conscientious
with
just
a
suspicion
of
dash
where
dash
is
needed
he
knows
the
real
thing
when
he
sees
it
and
there
s
not
a
fellow
living
more
alive
to
shams
i
won
t
be
a
sham
i
ll
be
it
you
ll
but
the
doubt
can
you
do
all
this
in
doubt
of
the
issue
no
i
must
have
confidence
in
the
end
and
i
must
believe
in
his
guilt
nothing
else
will
carry
me
through
i
must
believe
in
his
yes
that
s
and
i
do
i
never
was
surer
of
anything
than
i
am
of
that
but
i
ll
have
the
deuce
of
a
time
to
get
evidence
enough
for
a
grand
jury
that
s
plainly
to
be
seen
and
that
s
why
i
m
so
dead
set
on
the
business
it
s
such
an
even
i
don
t
call
it
even
he
s
got
the
start
of
you
every
way
you
can
t
go
to
his
tenement
the
janitor
there
would
recognise
you
even
if
he
didn
now
i
will
give
you
a
piece
of
good
news
they
re
to
have
a
new
janitor
next
week
i
learned
that
yesterday
the
present
one
is
too
easy
he
ll
be
out
long
before
i
m
ready
to
show
myself
there
and
so
will
the
woman
who
took
care
of
the
poor
washerwoman
s
little
child
i
d
not
have
risked
her
curiosity
luck
isn
t
all
against
us
how
does
challoner
feel
about
it
not
very
confident
but
willing
to
give
you
any
amount
of
rope
sweetwater
he
let
me
have
a
batch
of
letters
written
by
his
daughter
which
he
found
in
a
secret
drawer
they
are
not
to
be
read
or
even
opened
unless
a
great
necessity
arises
they
were
written
for
brotherson
s
eye
or
so
the
father
says
but
she
never
sent
them
too
exuberant
perhaps
if
you
ever
want
them
i
can
not
give
them
to
you
and
wouldn
t
if
i
could
don
t
go
to
challoner
you
must
never
be
seen
at
his
hotel
and
don
t
come
to
me
but
to
the
little
house
in
west
street
where
they
will
be
kept
for
you
tied
up
in
a
package
with
your
name
on
it
by
the
way
what
name
are
you
going
to
work
under
my
mother
s
good
i
ll
remember
you
can
always
write
or
even
telephone
to
street
i
m
in
constant
communication
with
them
there
and
it
s
quite
thanks
you
re
sure
the
superintendent
is
with
me
yes
but
not
the
inspector
he
sees
nothing
but
the
victim
of
a
strange
coincidence
in
orlando
again
the
scales
hang
even
but
they
won
t
remain
so
one
side
is
bound
to
rise
which
that
s
the
question
xvi
opposed
there
was
a
new
tenant
in
the
hicks
street
tenement
he
arrived
late
one
afternoon
and
was
shown
two
rooms
one
in
the
rear
building
and
another
in
the
front
one
both
were
on
the
fourth
floor
he
demurred
at
the
former
thought
it
gloomy
but
finally
consented
to
try
it
the
other
he
said
was
too
expensive
the
janitor
new
to
the
business
was
not
much
taken
with
him
and
showed
it
which
seemed
to
offend
the
newcomer
who
was
evidently
an
irritable
fellow
owing
to
ill
health
however
they
came
to
terms
as
i
have
said
and
the
man
went
away
promising
to
send
in
his
belongings
the
next
day
he
smiled
as
he
said
this
and
the
janitor
who
had
rarely
seen
such
a
change
take
place
in
a
human
face
looked
uncomfortable
for
a
moment
and
seemed
disposed
to
make
some
remark
about
the
room
they
were
leaving
but
thinking
better
of
it
locked
the
door
and
led
the
way
downstairs
as
the
prospective
tenant
followed
he
may
have
noticed
probably
did
that
the
door
they
had
just
left
was
a
new
one
the
only
new
thing
to
be
seen
in
the
whole
shabby
place
the
next
night
that
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
the
young
man
had
taken
possession
as
he
put
away
the
remnants
of
a
meal
he
had
cooked
for
himself
he
cast
a
look
at
his
surroundings
and
imperceptibly
sighed
then
he
brightened
again
and
sitting
down
on
his
solitary
chair
he
turned
his
eyes
on
the
window
which
uncurtained
and
without
shade
stared
as
it
were
at
the
opposite
wall
rising
high
across
the
court
in
that
wall
one
window
only
seemed
to
interest
him
and
that
was
on
a
level
with
his
own
the
shade
of
this
window
was
up
but
there
was
no
light
back
of
it
and
so
nothing
of
the
interior
could
be
seen
but
his
eye
remained
fixed
upon
it
while
his
hand
stretched
out
towards
the
lamp
burning
near
him
held
itself
in
readiness
to
lower
the
light
at
a
minute
s
notice
did
he
see
only
the
opposite
wall
and
that
unillumined
window
was
there
no
memory
of
the
time
when
in
a
previous
contemplation
of
those
dismal
panes
he
beheld
stretching
between
them
and
himself
a
long
low
bench
with
a
plain
wooden
tub
upon
it
from
which
a
dripping
cloth
beat
out
upon
the
boards
beneath
a
dismal
note
monotonous
as
the
ticking
of
a
clock
one
might
judge
that
such
memories
were
indeed
his
from
the
rapid
glance
he
cast
behind
him
at
the
place
where
the
bed
had
stood
in
those
days
it
was
placed
differently
now
but
if
he
saw
and
if
he
heard
these
suggestions
from
the
past
he
was
not
less
alive
to
the
exactions
of
the
present
for
as
his
glance
flew
back
across
the
court
his
finger
suddenly
moved
and
the
flame
it
controlled
sputtered
and
went
out
at
the
same
instant
the
window
opposite
sprang
into
view
as
the
lamp
was
lit
within
and
for
several
minutes
the
whole
interior
remained
visible
the
books
the
the
cluttered
furniture
and
most
interesting
of
all
its
owner
and
occupant
it
was
upon
the
latter
that
the
newcomer
fixed
his
attention
and
with
an
absorption
equal
to
that
he
saw
expressed
in
the
countenance
opposite
but
his
was
the
absorption
of
watchfulness
that
of
the
other
of
introspection
brotherson
we
will
no
longer
call
him
dunn
even
here
where
he
is
known
by
no
other
name
had
entered
the
room
clad
in
his
heavy
overcoat
and
not
having
taken
it
off
before
lighting
his
lamp
still
stood
with
it
on
gazing
eagerly
down
at
the
model
occupying
the
place
of
honour
on
the
large
centre
table
he
was
not
touching
it
not
at
this
moment
but
that
his
thoughts
were
with
it
that
his
whole
mind
was
concentrated
on
it
was
evident
to
the
watcher
across
the
court
and
as
this
watcher
took
in
this
fact
and
noticed
the
loving
care
with
which
the
enthusiastic
inventor
finally
put
out
his
finger
to
a
thread
or
twirl
a
wheel
his
disappointment
found
utterance
in
a
sigh
which
echoed
sadly
through
the
dull
and
cheerless
room
had
he
expected
this
stern
and
man
to
show
an
open
indifference
to
work
and
the
hopes
of
a
lifetime
if
so
this
was
the
first
of
the
many
surprises
awaiting
him
he
was
gifted
however
with
the
patience
of
an
automaton
and
continued
to
watch
his
fellow
tenant
as
long
as
the
latter
s
shade
remained
up
when
it
fell
he
rose
and
took
a
few
steps
up
and
down
but
not
with
the
celerity
and
precision
which
usually
accompanied
his
movements
doubt
disturbed
his
mind
and
impeded
his
activity
he
had
caught
a
fair
glimpse
of
brotherson
s
face
as
he
approached
the
window
and
though
it
continued
to
show
abstraction
it
equally
displayed
serenity
and
a
complete
satisfaction
with
the
present
if
not
with
the
future
had
he
mistaken
his
man
after
all
was
his
instinct
for
the
first
time
in
his
active
career
wholly
at
fault
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
a
glimpse
of
his
quarry
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
room
at
home
with
his
thoughts
and
unconscious
of
any
espionage
and
how
had
he
found
him
cheerful
and
natural
in
all
his
movements
but
the
evening
was
young
retrospect
comes
with
later
and
more
lonely
hours
there
will
be
opportunities
yet
for
studying
this
impassive
countenance
under
much
more
telling
and
productive
circumstances
than
these
he
would
await
these
opportunities
with
cheerful
anticipation
meanwhile
he
would
keep
up
the
routine
watch
he
had
planned
for
this
night
something
might
yet
occur
at
all
events
he
would
have
exhausted
the
situation
from
this
standpoint
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
at
an
hour
when
all
the
other
people
in
the
building
were
asleep
or
at
least
striving
to
sleep
these
two
men
still
sat
at
their
work
one
in
the
light
the
other
in
the
darkness
facing
each
other
consciously
to
the
one
unconsciously
to
the
other
across
the
hollow
well
of
the
now
silent
court
eleven
o
clock
twelve
no
change
on
brotherson
s
part
or
in
brotherson
s
room
but
a
decided
one
in
the
place
where
sweetwater
sat
objects
which
had
been
totally
indistinguishable
even
to
his
penetrating
eye
could
now
be
seen
in
ever
brightening
outline
the
moon
had
reached
the
open
space
above
the
court
and
he
was
getting
the
full
benefit
of
it
but
it
was
a
benefit
he
would
have
been
glad
to
dispense
with
darkness
was
like
a
shield
to
him
he
did
not
feel
quite
sure
that
he
wanted
this
shield
removed
with
no
curtain
to
the
window
and
no
shade
and
all
this
brilliance
pouring
into
the
room
he
feared
the
disclosure
of
his
presence
there
or
if
not
that
some
effect
on
his
own
mind
of
those
memories
he
was
more
anxious
to
see
mirrored
in
another
s
discomfiture
than
in
his
own
was
it
to
escape
any
lack
of
concentration
which
these
same
memories
might
bring
that
he
rose
and
stepped
to
the
window
or
was
it
under
one
of
those
involuntary
impulses
which
move
us
in
spite
of
ourselves
to
do
the
very
thing
our
judgment
disapproves
no
sooner
had
he
approached
the
sill
than
brotherson
s
shade
flew
way
up
and
he
too
looked
out
their
glances
met
and
for
an
instant
the
hardy
detective
experienced
that
involuntary
stagnation
of
the
blood
which
follows
an
inner
shock
he
felt
that
he
had
been
recognised
the
moonlight
lay
full
upon
his
face
and
the
other
had
seen
and
known
him
else
why
the
constrained
attitude
and
sudden
rigidity
observable
in
this
confronting
figure
with
its
partially
lifted
hand
a
man
like
brotherson
makes
no
pause
in
any
action
however
trivial
without
a
reason
either
he
had
been
transfixed
by
this
glimpse
of
his
enemy
on
watch
or
daring
thought
had
seen
enough
of
sepulchral
suggestion
in
the
wan
face
looking
forth
from
this
fatal
window
to
shake
him
from
his
composure
and
let
loose
the
grinning
devil
of
remorse
from
its
iron
if
so
the
movement
was
a
memorable
one
and
the
hazard
quite
worth
while
he
had
gained
no
he
had
gained
nothing
he
had
been
the
fool
of
his
own
wishes
no
one
let
alone
brotherson
could
have
mistaken
his
face
for
that
of
a
woman
he
had
forgotten
his
beard
some
other
cause
must
be
found
for
the
other
s
attitude
it
savoured
of
shock
if
not
fear
if
it
were
fear
then
had
he
roused
an
emotion
which
might
rebound
upon
himself
in
sharp
reprisal
death
had
been
known
to
strike
people
standing
where
he
stood
mysterious
death
of
a
species
quite
unrecognisable
what
warranty
had
he
that
it
would
not
strike
him
and
now
none
yet
it
was
brotherson
who
moved
first
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
plainly
visible
to
the
man
opposite
he
turned
away
from
the
window
and
without
lowering
the
shade
began
gathering
up
his
papers
for
the
night
and
later
banking
up
his
stove
with
ashes
sweetwater
with
a
breath
of
decided
relief
stepped
back
and
threw
himself
on
the
bed
it
had
really
been
a
trial
for
him
to
stand
there
under
the
other
s
eye
though
his
mind
refused
to
formulate
his
fear
or
to
give
him
any
satisfaction
when
he
asked
himself
what
there
was
in
the
situation
suggestive
of
death
to
the
woman
or
harm
to
himself
nor
did
morning
light
bring
counsel
as
is
usual
in
similar
cases
he
felt
the
mystery
more
in
the
hubbub
and
restless
turmoil
of
the
day
than
in
the
night
s
silence
and
inactivity
he
was
glad
when
the
stroke
of
six
gave
him
an
excuse
to
leave
the
room
and
gladder
yet
when
in
doing
so
he
ran
upon
an
old
woman
from
a
neighbouring
room
who
no
sooner
saw
him
than
she
leered
at
him
and
eagerly
remarked
not
much
sleep
eh
we
didn
t
think
you
d
like
it
did
you
see
anything
now
this
gave
him
the
one
excuse
he
wanted
see
anything
he
repeated
apparently
with
all
imaginable
innocence
what
do
you
mean
by
that
don
t
you
know
what
happened
in
that
room
don
t
tell
me
he
shouted
out
i
don
t
want
to
hear
any
nonsense
i
haven
t
time
i
ve
got
to
be
at
the
shop
at
seven
and
i
don
t
feel
very
well
what
did
happen
he
mumbled
in
drawing
off
just
loud
enough
for
the
woman
to
hear
something
unpleasant
i
m
then
he
ran
downstairs
at
half
past
six
he
found
the
janitor
he
was
to
all
appearance
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
and
he
spoke
very
fast
i
won
t
stay
another
night
in
that
room
he
loudly
declared
breaking
in
where
the
family
were
eating
breakfast
by
lamplight
i
don
t
want
to
make
any
trouble
and
i
don
t
want
to
give
my
reasons
but
that
room
don
t
suit
me
i
d
rather
take
the
dark
one
you
talked
about
yesterday
there
s
the
money
have
my
things
moved
will
ye
but
your
moving
out
after
one
night
s
stay
will
give
that
room
a
bad
name
stammered
the
janitor
rising
awkwardly
there
ll
be
talk
and
i
won
t
be
able
to
let
that
room
all
nonsense
every
man
hasn
t
the
nerves
i
have
you
ll
let
it
in
a
week
but
let
or
not
let
i
m
going
front
into
the
little
dark
room
i
ll
get
the
boss
to
let
me
off
at
half
past
four
so
that
s
he
waited
for
no
reply
and
got
none
but
when
he
appeared
promptly
at
a
quarter
to
five
he
found
his
few
belongings
moved
into
a
middle
room
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
front
building
which
oddly
perhaps
chanced
to
be
next
door
to
the
one
he
had
held
under
watch
the
night
before
the
first
page
of
his
adventure
in
the
hicks
street
tenement
had
been
turned
and
he
was
ready
to
start
upon
another
xvii
in
which
a
book
plays
a
leading
part
when
brotherson
came
in
that
night
he
noticed
that
the
door
of
the
room
adjoining
his
own
stood
open
he
did
not
hesitate
making
immediately
for
it
he
took
a
glance
inside
then
spoke
up
with
a
ringing
intonation
halloo
coming
to
live
in
this
hole
the
occupant
a
young
man
evidently
a
workman
and
somewhat
sickly
if
one
could
judge
from
his
complexion
turned
around
from
some
tinkering
he
was
engaged
in
and
met
the
intruder
fairly
face
to
face
if
his
jaw
fell
it
seemed
to
be
from
admiration
no
other
emotion
would
have
so
lighted
his
eye
as
he
took
in
the
others
proportions
and
commanding
features
no
dress
brotherson
was
never
seen
in
any
other
than
the
homeliest
garb
in
these
days
could
make
him
look
common
or
akin
to
his
surroundings
whether
seen
near
or
far
his
presence
always
caused
surprise
and
surprise
was
what
the
young
man
showed
as
he
answered
briskly
yes
this
is
to
be
my
castle
are
you
the
owner
of
the
buildings
if
so
i
am
not
the
owner
i
live
next
door
haven
t
i
seen
you
before
young
man
never
was
there
a
more
penetrating
eye
than
orlando
brotherson
s
as
he
asked
this
question
it
took
some
effort
on
the
part
of
the
other
to
hold
his
own
and
laugh
with
perfect
naturalness
as
he
replied
if
you
ever
go
up
henry
street
it
s
likely
enough
that
you
ve
seen
me
not
once
but
many
times
i
m
the
fellow
who
works
at
the
bench
next
the
window
in
schuper
s
repairing
shop
everybody
knows
audacity
often
carries
the
day
when
subtler
means
would
fail
brotherson
stared
at
the
youth
then
ventured
another
question
a
carpenter
eh
yes
and
i
m
an
man
at
my
job
excuse
my
brag
it
s
my
one
card
of
i
ve
seen
you
i
ve
seen
you
somewhere
else
than
in
schuper
s
shop
do
you
remember
me
no
sir
i
m
sorry
to
be
imperlite
but
i
don
t
remember
you
at
all
won
t
you
sit
down
it
s
not
very
cheerful
but
i
m
so
glad
to
get
out
of
the
room
i
was
in
last
night
that
this
looks
all
right
to
me
back
there
other
building
he
whispered
i
didn
t
know
and
took
the
room
which
had
a
window
in
it
but
the
stop
was
significant
so
was
his
smile
which
had
a
touch
of
sickliness
in
it
as
well
as
humour
but
brotherson
was
not
to
be
caught
you
slept
in
the
building
last
night
in
the
other
half
i
mean
yes
i
the
strong
lip
of
the
other
man
curled
disdainfully
i
saw
you
said
he
you
were
standing
in
the
window
overlooking
the
court
you
were
not
sleeping
then
i
suppose
you
know
that
a
woman
died
in
that
room
yes
they
told
me
so
this
was
that
the
first
you
d
heard
of
it
sure
the
word
almost
jumped
at
the
questioner
do
you
suppose
i
d
have
taken
the
room
if
but
here
the
intruder
with
a
disdainful
grunt
turned
and
went
out
disgust
in
every
feature
plain
unmistakable
downright
disgust
and
nothing
more
this
was
what
gave
sweetwater
his
second
bad
night
this
and
a
certain
discovery
he
made
he
had
counted
on
hearing
what
went
on
in
the
neighbouring
room
through
the
partition
running
back
of
his
own
closet
but
he
could
hear
nothing
unless
it
was
the
shutting
down
of
a
window
a
loud
sneeze
or
the
rattling
of
coals
as
they
were
put
on
the
fire
and
these
possessed
no
significance
what
he
wanted
was
to
catch
the
secret
sigh
the
muttered
word
the
involuntary
movement
he
was
too
far
removed
from
this
man
still
how
should
he
manage
to
get
nearer
him
at
the
door
of
his
mind
of
his
heart
sweetwater
stared
all
night
from
his
miserable
cot
into
the
darkness
of
that
separating
closet
and
with
no
result
his
task
looked
hopeless
no
wonder
that
he
could
get
no
rest
next
morning
he
felt
ill
but
he
rose
all
the
same
and
tried
to
get
his
own
breakfast
he
had
but
partially
succeeded
and
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
in
wretched
discomfort
when
the
very
man
he
was
thinking
of
appeared
at
his
door
i
ve
come
to
see
how
you
are
said
brotherson
i
noticed
that
you
did
not
look
well
last
night
won
t
you
come
in
and
share
my
pot
of
coffee
i
i
can
t
eat
mumbled
sweetwater
for
once
in
his
life
thrown
completely
off
his
balance
you
re
very
kind
but
i
ll
manage
all
right
i
d
rather
i
m
not
quite
dressed
you
see
and
i
must
get
to
the
then
he
thought
what
an
opportunity
i
m
losing
have
i
any
right
to
turn
tail
because
he
plays
his
game
from
the
outset
with
trumps
no
i
ve
a
small
trump
somewhere
about
me
to
lay
on
this
trick
it
isn
t
an
ace
but
it
ll
show
i
m
not
and
smiling
though
not
with
his
usual
cheerfulness
sweetwater
added
is
the
coffee
all
made
i
might
take
a
drop
of
that
but
you
mustn
t
ask
me
to
eat
i
just
couldn
yes
the
coffee
is
made
and
it
isn
t
bad
either
you
d
better
put
on
your
coat
the
hall
s
and
waiting
till
sweetwater
did
so
he
led
the
way
back
to
his
own
room
brotherson
s
manner
expressed
perfect
ease
sweetwater
s
not
he
knew
himself
changed
in
looks
in
bearing
in
feeling
even
but
was
he
changed
enough
to
deceive
this
man
on
the
very
spot
where
they
had
confronted
each
other
a
few
days
before
in
a
keen
moral
struggle
the
he
passed
on
his
way
to
the
table
where
the
simple
breakfast
was
spread
out
showed
him
a
figure
so
unlike
the
alert
chap
he
had
been
that
night
that
he
felt
his
old
assurance
revive
in
time
to
ease
a
situation
which
had
no
counterpart
in
his
experience
i
m
going
out
myself
so
we
ll
have
to
hurry
a
bit
was
brotherson
s
first
remark
as
they
seated
themselves
at
table
do
you
like
your
coffee
plain
or
with
milk
in
it
plain
gosh
what
pictures
where
do
you
get
em
you
must
have
a
lot
of
sweetwater
was
staring
at
the
row
of
photographs
mostly
of
a
very
high
order
tacked
along
the
wall
separating
the
two
rooms
they
were
unframed
but
they
were
mostly
copies
of
great
pictures
and
the
effect
was
rather
imposing
in
contrast
to
the
shabby
furniture
and
the
otherwise
homely
fittings
yes
i
ve
enough
for
that
kind
of
thing
was
his
host
s
reply
but
the
tone
was
reserved
and
sweetwater
did
not
presume
again
along
this
line
instead
he
looked
well
at
the
books
piled
upon
the
shelves
under
these
photographs
and
wondered
aloud
at
their
number
and
at
the
man
who
could
waste
such
a
lot
of
time
in
reading
them
but
he
made
no
more
direct
remarks
was
he
cowed
by
the
penetrating
eye
he
encountered
whenever
he
yielded
to
the
fascination
exerted
by
brotherson
s
personality
and
looked
his
way
he
hated
to
think
so
yet
something
held
him
in
check
and
made
him
listen
when
the
other
chose
to
speak
yet
there
was
one
cheerful
moment
it
was
when
he
noticed
the
careless
way
in
which
those
books
were
arranged
upon
their
shelves
an
idea
had
come
to
him
he
hid
his
relief
in
his
cup
as
he
drained
the
last
drops
of
the
coffee
which
really
tasted
better
than
he
had
expected
when
he
returned
from
work
that
afternoon
it
was
with
an
auger
under
his
coat
and
a
conviction
which
led
him
to
empty
out
the
contents
of
a
small
phial
which
he
took
down
from
a
shelf
he
had
told
gryce
that
he
was
eager
for
the
business
because
of
its
difficulties
but
that
was
when
he
was
feeling
fine
and
up
to
any
game
which
might
come
his
way
now
he
felt
weak
and
easily
discouraged
this
would
not
do
he
must
regain
his
health
at
all
hazards
so
he
poured
out
the
mixture
which
had
given
him
such
a
sickly
air
this
done
and
a
rude
supper
eaten
he
took
up
his
auger
he
had
heard
brotherson
s
step
go
by
but
next
minute
he
laid
it
down
again
in
great
haste
and
flung
a
newspaper
over
it
brotherson
was
coming
back
had
stopped
at
his
door
had
knocked
and
must
be
let
in
you
re
better
this
evening
he
heard
in
those
kindly
tones
which
so
confused
and
irritated
him
yes
was
the
surly
admission
but
it
s
stifling
here
if
i
have
to
live
long
in
this
hole
i
ll
dry
up
from
want
of
air
it
s
near
the
shop
or
i
wouldn
t
stay
out
the
twice
this
day
he
had
seen
brotherson
s
tall
figure
stop
before
the
window
of
this
shop
and
look
in
at
him
at
his
bench
but
he
said
nothing
about
that
yes
agreed
the
other
it
s
no
way
to
live
but
you
re
alone
upstairs
there
s
a
whole
family
huddled
into
a
room
just
like
this
two
of
the
kids
sleep
in
the
closet
it
s
things
like
that
which
have
made
me
the
friend
of
the
poor
and
the
mortal
enemy
of
men
and
women
who
spread
themselves
over
a
dozen
big
rooms
and
think
themselves
if
the
gas
burns
poorly
or
a
fireplace
smokes
i
m
off
for
the
evening
anything
i
can
do
for
you
show
me
how
i
can
win
my
way
into
such
rooms
as
you
ve
just
talked
about
nothing
less
will
make
me
look
up
i
d
like
to
sleep
in
one
in
the
best
bedroom
sir
i
m
ambitious
i
a
poor
joke
though
they
both
laughed
there
brotherson
passed
on
and
sweetwater
listened
till
he
was
sure
that
his
too
attentive
neighbour
had
really
gone
down
the
three
flights
between
him
and
the
street
then
he
took
up
his
auger
again
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
closet
there
was
nothing
peculiar
about
this
closet
it
was
just
an
ordinary
one
with
drawers
and
shelves
on
one
side
and
an
open
space
on
the
other
for
the
hanging
up
of
clothes
very
few
clothes
hung
there
at
present
but
it
was
in
this
portion
of
the
closet
that
he
stopped
and
began
to
try
the
wall
of
brotherson
s
room
with
the
butt
end
of
the
tool
he
carried
the
sound
seemed
to
satisfy
him
for
very
soon
he
was
boring
a
hole
at
a
point
exactly
level
with
his
ear
but
not
without
frequent
pauses
and
much
attention
given
to
the
possible
return
of
those
departed
he
remembered
that
brotherson
had
a
way
of
coming
back
on
unexpected
errands
after
giving
out
his
intention
of
being
absent
for
hours
sweetwater
did
not
want
to
be
caught
in
any
such
trap
as
that
so
he
carefully
followed
every
sound
that
reached
him
from
the
noisy
halls
but
he
did
not
forsake
his
post
he
did
not
have
to
brotherson
had
been
sincere
in
his
and
the
auger
finished
its
job
and
was
withdrawn
without
any
interruption
from
the
man
whose
premises
had
been
thus
audaciously
invaded
neat
as
well
as
useful
was
the
gay
comment
with
which
sweetwater
surveyed
his
work
then
laid
his
ear
to
the
hole
whereas
previously
he
could
barely
hear
the
rattling
of
coals
from
the
he
was
now
able
to
catch
the
sound
of
an
ash
falling
into
the
his
next
move
was
to
test
the
depth
of
the
partition
by
inserting
his
finger
in
the
hole
he
had
made
he
found
it
stopped
by
some
obstacle
before
it
had
reached
half
its
length
and
anxious
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
nature
of
this
obstacle
he
gently
moved
the
tip
of
his
finger
to
and
fro
over
what
was
certainly
the
edge
of
a
book
this
proved
that
his
calculations
had
been
correct
and
that
the
opening
so
accessible
on
his
side
was
completely
veiled
on
the
other
by
the
books
he
had
seen
packed
on
the
shelves
as
these
shelves
had
no
other
backing
than
the
wall
he
had
feared
striking
a
spot
not
covered
by
a
book
but
he
had
not
undertaken
so
risky
a
piece
of
work
without
first
noting
how
nearly
the
tops
of
the
books
approached
the
line
of
the
shelf
above
them
and
the
consequent
unlikelihood
of
his
striking
the
space
between
at
the
height
he
planned
the
hole
he
had
even
been
careful
to
assure
himself
that
all
the
volumes
at
this
exact
point
stood
far
enough
forward
to
afford
room
behind
them
for
the
chips
and
plaster
he
must
necessarily
push
through
with
his
auger
and
also
important
consideration
for
the
free
passage
of
the
sounds
by
which
he
hoped
to
profit
as
he
listened
for
a
moment
longer
and
then
stooped
to
gather
up
the
debris
which
had
fallen
on
his
own
side
of
the
partition
he
muttered
in
his
old
way
if
the
devil
don
t
interfere
in
some
way
best
known
to
himself
this
opportunity
i
have
made
for
myself
of
listening
to
this
arrogant
fellow
s
very
heartbeats
should
give
me
some
clew
to
his
secret
as
soon
as
i
can
stand
it
i
ll
spend
my
evenings
at
this
but
it
was
days
before
he
could
trust
himself
so
far
meanwhile
their
acquaintance
ripened
though
with
no
very
satisfactory
results
the
detective
found
himself
led
into
telling
stories
of
his
early
to
keep
pace
with
the
man
who
always
had
something
of
moment
and
solid
interest
to
impart
this
was
undesirable
for
instead
of
calling
out
a
corresponding
confidence
from
brotherson
it
only
seemed
to
make
his
conversation
more
coldly
impersonal
in
consequence
sweetwater
suddenly
found
himself
quite
well
and
one
evening
when
he
was
sure
that
his
neighbour
was
at
home
he
slid
softly
into
his
closet
and
laid
his
ear
to
the
opening
he
had
made
there
the
result
was
unexpected
brotherson
was
pacing
the
floor
and
talking
softly
to
himself
at
first
the
cadence
and
full
music
of
the
tones
conveyed
nothing
to
our
far
from
literary
detective
the
victim
of
his
secret
machinations
was
expressing
himself
in
words
words
that
was
the
point
which
counted
with
him
but
as
he
listened
longer
and
gradually
took
in
the
sense
of
these
words
his
heart
went
down
lower
and
lower
till
it
reached
his
boots
his
inscrutable
and
ever
disappointing
neighbour
was
not
indulging
in
of
any
kind
he
was
reciting
poetry
and
what
was
worse
poetry
which
he
only
half
remembered
and
was
trying
to
recall
an
incredible
occupation
for
a
man
weighted
with
a
criminal
secret
sweetwater
was
disgusted
and
was
withdrawing
in
high
indignation
from
his
when
something
occurred
of
a
startling
enough
nature
to
hold
him
where
he
was
in
almost
breathless
expectation
the
hole
which
in
the
darkness
of
the
closet
was
always
faintly
visible
even
when
the
light
was
not
very
strong
in
the
adjoining
room
had
suddenly
become
a
bright
and
shining
with
a
suggestion
of
movement
in
the
space
beyond
the
book
which
had
hid
this
hole
on
brotherson
s
side
had
been
taken
down
the
one
book
in
all
those
hundreds
whose
removal
threatened
sweetwater
s
schemes
if
not
himself
for
an
instant
the
thwarted
detective
listened
for
the
angry
shout
or
the
smothered
oath
which
would
naturally
follow
the
discovery
by
brotherson
of
this
attempted
interference
with
his
privacy
but
all
was
still
on
his
side
of
the
wall
a
rustling
of
leaves
could
be
heard
as
the
inventor
searched
for
the
poem
he
wanted
but
nothing
more
in
withdrawing
the
book
he
had
failed
to
notice
the
hole
in
the
plaster
back
of
it
but
he
could
hardly
fail
to
see
it
when
he
came
to
put
the
book
back
meantime
suspense
for
sweetwater
it
was
several
minutes
before
he
heard
brotherson
s
voice
again
then
it
was
in
triumphant
repetition
of
the
lines
which
had
escaped
his
memory
they
were
great
words
surely
and
sweetwater
never
forgot
them
but
the
impression
which
they
made
upon
his
mind
an
impression
so
forcible
that
he
was
able
to
repeat
them
months
afterward
to
gryce
did
not
prevent
him
from
noting
the
tone
in
which
they
were
uttered
nor
the
thud
which
followed
as
the
book
was
thrown
down
upon
the
floor
fool
the
word
rang
out
in
bitter
irony
from
his
irate
neighbour
s
lips
what
does
he
know
of
woman
woman
let
him
court
a
rich
one
and
see
but
that
s
all
over
and
done
with
no
more
harping
on
that
string
and
no
more
reading
of
poetry
i
ll
never
the
rest
was
lost
in
his
throat
and
was
quite
unintelligible
to
the
anxious
listener
words
which
an
instant
before
would
have
aroused
sweetwater
s
deepest
interest
but
they
had
suddenly
lost
all
force
for
the
unhappy
listener
the
sight
of
that
hole
still
shining
brightly
before
his
eyes
had
distracted
his
thoughts
and
roused
his
liveliest
apprehensions
if
that
book
should
be
allowed
to
lie
where
it
had
fallen
then
he
was
in
for
a
period
of
uncertainty
he
shrank
from
contemplating
any
moment
his
neighbour
might
look
up
and
catch
sight
of
this
hole
bored
in
the
backing
of
the
shelves
before
him
could
the
man
who
had
been
guilty
of
submitting
him
to
this
outrage
stand
the
strain
of
waiting
indefinitely
for
the
moment
of
discovery
he
doubted
it
if
the
suspense
lasted
too
long
shifting
his
position
he
placed
his
eye
where
his
ear
had
been
he
could
see
very
little
the
space
before
him
limited
as
it
was
to
the
width
of
the
one
volume
withdrawn
precluded
his
seeing
aught
but
what
lay
directly
before
him
happily
it
was
in
this
narrow
line
of
vision
that
brotherson
stood
he
had
resumed
work
upon
his
model
and
was
so
placed
that
while
his
face
was
not
visible
his
hands
were
and
as
sweetwater
watched
these
hands
and
noticed
the
delicacy
of
their
manipulation
he
was
enough
of
a
workman
to
realise
that
work
so
fine
called
for
an
undivided
attention
he
need
not
fear
the
gaze
shifting
while
those
hands
moved
as
warily
as
they
did
now
relieved
for
the
moment
he
left
his
post
and
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
his
cot
gave
himself
up
to
thought
he
deserved
this
mischance
had
he
profited
properly
by
gryce
s
teachings
he
would
not
have
been
caught
like
this
he
would
have
calculated
not
upon
the
nine
hundred
and
chances
of
that
book
being
left
alone
but
upon
the
thousandth
one
of
its
being
the
very
one
to
be
singled
out
and
removed
had
he
done
this
had
he
taken
pains
to
so
roughen
and
discolour
the
opening
he
had
made
that
it
would
look
like
an
ancient
rat
hole
instead
of
showing
a
clean
bore
he
would
have
some
answer
to
give
brotherson
when
he
came
to
question
him
in
regard
to
it
but
now
the
whole
thing
seemed
up
he
had
shown
himself
a
fool
and
by
good
rights
ought
to
acknowledge
his
defeat
and
return
to
headquarters
but
he
had
too
much
spirit
for
that
he
would
rather
yes
he
would
rather
face
the
pistol
he
had
once
seen
in
his
enemy
s
hand
yet
it
was
hard
to
sit
here
waiting
waiting
suddenly
he
started
upright
he
would
go
meet
his
fate
be
present
in
the
room
itself
when
the
discovery
was
made
which
threatened
to
upset
all
his
plans
he
was
not
ashamed
of
his
calling
and
brotherson
would
think
twice
before
attacking
him
when
once
convinced
that
he
had
the
department
behind
him
excuse
me
comrade
were
the
words
with
which
he
endeavoured
to
account
for
his
presence
at
brotherson
s
door
my
lamp
smells
so
and
i
ve
made
such
a
mess
of
my
work
that
i
ve
just
stepped
in
for
a
chat
if
i
m
not
wanted
say
so
i
don
t
want
to
bother
you
but
you
do
look
pleasant
here
i
hope
the
thing
i
m
turning
over
in
my
head
every
man
has
his
schemes
for
making
a
fortune
you
know
will
be
a
success
some
day
i
d
like
a
big
room
like
this
and
a
lot
of
books
and
and
craning
his
neck
he
took
a
peep
at
the
shelves
with
an
air
of
open
admiration
which
effectually
concealed
his
real
purpose
what
he
wanted
was
to
catch
one
glimpse
of
that
empty
space
from
his
present
standpoint
and
he
was
both
astonished
and
relieved
to
note
how
narrow
and
inconspicuous
it
looked
certainly
he
had
less
to
fear
than
he
supposed
and
when
upon
brotherson
s
invitation
he
stepped
into
the
room
it
was
with
a
dash
of
his
former
audacity
which
gave
him
unfortunately
perhaps
a
quick
strong
and
unexpected
likeness
to
his
old
self
but
if
brotherson
noticed
this
nothing
in
his
manner
gave
proof
of
the
fact
though
usually
averse
to
visitors
especially
when
employed
as
at
present
on
his
precious
model
he
quite
warmed
towards
his
unexpected
guest
and
even
led
the
way
to
where
it
stood
uncovered
on
the
table
you
find
me
at
work
he
remarked
i
don
t
suppose
you
understand
any
but
your
own
if
you
mean
to
ask
if
i
understand
what
you
re
trying
to
do
there
i
m
free
to
say
that
i
don
t
i
couldn
t
tell
now
whether
it
s
an
you
re
planning
a
hydraulic
machine
or
or
he
stopped
with
a
laugh
and
turned
towards
the
now
here
s
what
i
like
these
books
just
take
my
look
at
them
then
i
like
to
see
a
man
interested
in
books
only
i
thought
if
you
knew
how
to
handle
wire
i
would
get
you
to
hold
this
end
while
i
work
with
the
i
guess
i
know
enough
for
that
was
sweetwater
s
gay
rejoinder
but
when
he
felt
that
communicating
wire
in
his
hand
and
experienced
for
the
first
time
the
full
influence
of
the
other
s
eye
it
took
all
his
hardihood
to
hide
the
hypnotic
thrill
it
gave
him
though
he
smiled
and
chatted
he
could
not
help
asking
himself
between
whiles
what
had
killed
the
poor
washerwoman
across
the
court
and
what
had
killed
miss
challoner
something
visible
or
something
invisible
something
which
gave
warning
of
attack
or
something
which
struck
in
silence
he
found
himself
gazing
long
and
earnestly
at
this
man
s
hand
and
wondering
if
death
lay
under
it
it
was
a
strong
hand
a
deft
member
formed
to
respond
to
the
slightest
hint
from
the
powerful
brain
controlling
it
but
was
this
its
whole
story
had
he
said
all
when
he
had
said
this
fascinated
by
the
question
sweetwater
died
a
hundred
deaths
in
his
awakened
fancy
as
he
followed
the
sharp
short
instructions
which
fell
with
cool
precision
from
the
other
s
lips
a
hundred
deaths
i
say
but
with
no
betrayal
of
his
folly
the
anxiety
he
showed
was
that
of
one
eager
to
please
which
may
explain
why
on
the
conclusion
of
his
task
brotherson
gave
him
one
of
his
infrequent
smiles
and
remarked
as
he
buried
the
model
under
its
cover
you
re
handy
and
you
re
quiet
at
your
job
who
knows
but
that
i
shall
want
you
again
will
you
come
if
i
call
you
won
t
i
was
the
gay
retort
as
the
detective
thus
released
stooped
for
the
book
still
lying
on
the
floor
paolo
and
francesca
he
read
from
the
back
as
he
laid
it
on
the
table
poetry
he
queried
rot
scornfully
returned
the
other
as
he
moved
to
take
down
a
bottle
and
some
glasses
from
a
cupboard
let
into
another
portion
of
the
wall
sweetwater
taking
advantage
of
the
moment
sidled
towards
the
shelf
where
that
empty
space
still
gaped
with
the
hole
at
the
back
he
could
easily
have
replaced
the
missing
book
before
brotherson
turned
but
the
issue
was
too
doubtful
he
was
dealing
with
no
fool
and
it
behooved
him
to
avoid
above
all
things
calling
attention
to
the
book
or
to
the
place
on
the
shelf
where
it
belonged
but
there
was
one
thing
he
could
do
and
did
reaching
out
a
finger
as
deft
as
brotherson
s
own
he
pushed
a
second
volume
into
the
place
of
the
one
that
was
gone
this
veiled
the
completely
a
fact
which
so
entirely
relieved
his
mind
that
his
old
smile
came
back
like
sunshine
to
his
lips
and
it
was
only
by
a
distinct
effort
that
he
kept
the
dancing
humour
from
his
eyes
as
he
prepared
to
refuse
the
glass
which
brotherson
now
brought
forward
none
of
that
said
he
you
mustn
t
tempt
me
the
doctor
has
shut
down
on
all
kinds
of
spirits
for
two
months
more
at
least
but
don
t
let
me
hinder
you
i
can
bear
to
smell
the
stuff
my
turn
will
come
again
some
but
brotherson
did
not
drink
setting
down
the
glass
he
carried
he
took
up
the
book
lying
near
weighed
it
in
his
hand
and
laid
it
down
again
with
an
air
of
thoughtful
inquiry
then
he
suddenly
pushed
it
towards
sweetwater
do
you
want
it
he
asked
sweetwater
was
too
taken
aback
to
answer
immediately
this
was
a
move
he
did
not
understand
want
it
he
what
he
wanted
was
to
see
it
put
back
in
its
place
on
the
shelf
did
brotherson
suspect
this
the
supposition
was
incredible
yet
who
could
read
a
mind
so
mysterious
sweetwater
debating
the
subject
decided
that
the
risk
of
adding
to
any
such
possible
suspicion
was
less
to
be
dreaded
than
the
continued
threat
offered
by
that
unoccupied
space
so
near
the
hole
which
testified
so
unmistakably
of
the
means
he
had
taken
to
spy
upon
this
suspected
man
s
privacy
so
after
a
moment
of
awkward
silence
not
out
of
keeping
with
the
character
he
had
assumed
he
calmly
refused
the
present
as
he
had
the
glass
unhappily
he
was
not
rewarded
by
seeing
the
despised
volume
restored
to
its
shelf
it
still
lay
where
its
owner
had
pushed
it
when
with
some
awkwardly
muttered
thanks
the
discomfited
detective
withdrew
to
his
own
room
xviii
what
am
i
to
do
now
early
morning
saw
sweetwater
peering
into
the
depths
of
his
closet
the
hole
was
hardly
visible
this
meant
that
the
book
he
had
pushed
across
it
from
the
other
side
had
not
been
removed
greatly
by
the
sight
he
awaited
his
opportunity
and
as
soon
as
a
suitable
one
presented
itself
prepared
the
hole
for
inspection
by
breaking
away
its
edges
and
begriming
it
well
with
plaster
and
old
dirt
this
done
he
left
matters
to
arrange
themselves
which
they
did
after
this
manner
brotherson
suddenly
developed
a
great
need
of
him
and
it
became
a
common
thing
for
him
to
spend
the
half
and
sometimes
the
whole
of
the
evening
in
the
neighbouring
room
this
was
just
what
he
had
worked
for
and
his
constant
intercourse
with
the
man
whose
secret
he
sought
to
surprise
should
have
borne
fruit
but
it
did
not
nothing
in
the
eager
but
painstaking
inventor
showed
a
distracted
mind
or
a
soul
indeed
he
was
so
calm
in
all
his
ways
so
precise
and
so
that
sweetwater
often
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
fiery
agitator
and
eloquent
propagandist
of
new
and
startling
doctrines
then
he
thought
he
understood
the
riddle
the
model
was
reaching
its
completion
and
brotherson
s
extreme
interest
in
it
and
the
confidence
he
had
in
its
success
swallowed
up
all
lesser
emotions
were
the
invention
to
prove
a
failure
but
there
was
small
hope
of
this
the
man
was
of
too
a
mind
to
his
work
or
miscalculate
its
place
among
modern
improvements
soon
he
would
reach
the
goal
of
his
desires
be
praised
feted
made
much
of
by
the
very
people
he
now
professedly
scorned
there
was
no
thoroughfare
for
sweetwater
here
another
road
must
be
found
some
secret
strange
and
unforeseen
method
of
reaching
a
soul
inaccessible
to
all
ordinary
or
even
extraordinary
impressions
would
a
night
of
thought
reveal
such
a
method
night
the
very
word
brought
inspiration
a
man
is
not
his
full
self
at
night
secrets
which
under
the
ordinary
circumstances
of
everyday
life
lie
too
deep
for
surprise
creep
from
their
in
the
dismal
hours
of
universal
quiet
and
lips
which
are
dumb
to
the
most
subtle
of
questioners
break
into
strange
and
mutterings
when
sleep
lies
heavy
on
ear
and
eye
and
the
forces
of
life
and
death
are
released
to
play
with
the
rudderless
spirit
it
was
in
different
words
from
these
that
sweetwater
reasoned
no
doubt
but
his
conclusions
were
the
same
and
as
he
continued
to
brood
over
them
he
saw
a
chance
a
fool
s
chance
possibly
but
fools
sometimes
win
where
wise
men
fail
of
reaching
those
depths
he
still
believed
in
notwithstanding
his
failure
to
sound
them
addressing
a
letter
to
his
friend
in
street
he
awaited
reply
in
the
shape
of
a
small
package
he
had
ordered
sent
to
the
corner
when
it
came
he
carried
it
home
in
a
state
of
mingled
hope
and
misgiving
was
he
about
to
cap
his
fortnight
of
disappointment
by
another
signal
failure
end
the
matter
by
disclosing
his
hand
lose
all
or
win
all
by
an
experiment
as
daring
and
possibly
as
fanciful
as
were
his
continued
suspicions
of
this
seemingly
upright
and
undoubtedly
busy
man
he
made
no
attempt
to
argue
the
question
the
event
called
for
the
exercise
of
the
most
dogged
elements
in
his
character
and
upon
these
he
must
rely
he
would
make
the
effort
he
contemplated
simply
because
he
was
minded
to
do
so
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
but
any
one
noting
him
well
that
night
would
have
seen
that
he
ate
little
and
consulted
his
watch
continually
sweetwater
had
not
yet
passed
the
line
where
work
becomes
routine
and
the
feelings
remain
totally
under
control
brotherson
was
unusually
active
and
alert
that
evening
he
was
anxious
to
fit
one
delicate
bit
of
mechanism
into
another
and
he
was
continually
interrupted
by
visitors
some
big
event
was
on
in
the
socialistic
world
and
his
presence
was
eagerly
demanded
by
one
brotherhood
after
another
sweetwater
posted
at
his
heard
the
arguments
advanced
by
each
separate
spokesman
followed
by
brotherson
s
unvarying
reply
that
when
his
work
was
done
and
he
had
proved
his
right
to
approach
them
with
a
message
they
might
look
to
hear
from
him
again
but
not
before
his
patience
was
inexhaustible
but
he
showed
himself
relieved
when
the
hour
grew
too
late
for
further
interruption
he
began
to
whistle
a
token
that
all
was
going
well
with
him
and
sweetwater
who
had
come
to
understand
some
of
his
moods
looked
forward
to
an
hour
or
two
of
continuous
work
on
brotherson
s
part
and
of
dreary
and
impatient
waiting
on
his
own
but
as
so
many
times
before
he
misread
the
man
earlier
than
common
much
earlier
in
fact
brotherson
laid
down
his
tools
and
gave
himself
up
to
a
restless
pacing
of
the
floor
this
was
not
usual
with
him
nor
did
he
often
indulge
himself
in
playing
on
the
piano
as
he
did
beginning
with
a
few
heavenly
strains
and
ending
with
a
bang
that
made
the
jump
certainly
something
was
amiss
in
the
quarter
where
peace
had
hitherto
reigned
undisturbed
had
the
depths
begun
to
heave
or
were
physical
causes
alone
responsible
for
these
unwonted
ebullitions
of
feeling
the
question
was
immaterial
either
would
form
an
excellent
preparation
for
the
coup
planned
by
sweetwater
and
when
after
another
hour
of
uncertainty
perfect
silence
greeted
him
from
his
neighbour
s
room
hope
had
soared
again
on
exultant
wing
far
above
all
former
discouragements
brotherson
s
bed
was
in
a
remote
corner
from
the
made
by
sweetwater
but
in
the
stillness
now
pervading
the
whole
building
the
latter
could
hear
his
even
breathing
very
distinctly
he
was
in
a
deep
sleep
the
young
detective
s
moment
had
come
taking
from
his
breast
a
small
box
he
placed
it
on
a
shelf
close
against
the
partition
an
instant
of
quiet
listening
then
he
touched
a
spring
in
the
side
of
the
box
and
laid
his
ear
in
haste
to
his
a
strain
of
music
broke
softly
from
the
box
and
sent
its
vibrations
through
the
wall
it
was
answered
instantly
by
a
stir
within
then
as
the
noble
air
continued
awakening
memories
of
that
fatal
instant
when
it
crashed
through
the
corridors
of
the
hotel
clermont
drowning
miss
challoner
s
cry
if
not
the
sound
of
her
fall
a
word
burst
from
the
sleeping
man
s
lips
which
carried
its
own
message
to
the
listening
detective
it
was
edith
miss
challoner
s
first
name
and
the
tone
bespoke
a
shaken
soul
sweetwater
gasping
with
excitement
caught
the
box
from
the
shelf
and
silenced
it
it
had
done
its
work
and
it
was
no
part
of
sweetwater
s
plan
to
have
this
strain
located
or
even
to
be
thought
real
but
its
echo
still
lingered
in
brotherson
s
otherwise
unconscious
ears
for
another
edith
escaped
his
lips
followed
by
a
smothered
but
forceful
utterance
of
these
five
words
you
know
i
promised
you
promised
her
what
he
did
not
say
would
he
have
done
so
had
the
music
lasted
a
trifle
longer
would
he
yet
complete
his
sentence
sweetwater
trembled
with
eagerness
and
listened
breathlessly
for
the
next
sound
brotherson
was
awake
he
was
tossing
in
his
bed
now
he
has
leaped
to
the
floor
sweetwater
hears
him
groan
then
comes
another
silence
broken
at
last
by
the
sound
of
his
body
falling
back
upon
the
bed
and
the
troubled
ejaculation
of
good
god
wrung
from
lips
no
torture
could
have
forced
into
complaint
under
any
daytime
conditions
sweetwater
continued
to
listen
but
he
had
heard
all
and
after
some
few
minutes
longer
of
fruitless
waiting
he
withdrew
from
his
post
the
episode
was
over
he
would
hear
no
more
that
night
was
he
satisfied
certainly
the
event
puerile
as
it
might
seem
to
some
had
opened
up
strange
vistas
to
his
aroused
imagination
the
words
edith
you
know
i
promised
you
were
in
themselves
provocative
of
strange
and
doubtful
conjectures
had
the
sleeper
under
the
influence
of
a
strain
of
music
indissolubly
associated
with
the
death
of
miss
challoner
been
so
completely
forced
back
into
the
circumstances
and
environment
of
that
moment
that
his
mind
had
taken
up
and
his
lips
repeated
the
thoughts
with
which
that
moment
of
horror
was
charged
sweetwater
imagined
the
scene
saw
the
figure
of
brotherson
hesitating
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
saw
hers
advancing
from
the
with
startled
and
uplifted
hand
heard
the
music
the
crash
of
that
great
finale
and
decided
without
hesitation
that
the
words
he
had
just
heard
were
indeed
the
thoughts
of
that
moment
edith
you
know
i
promised
you
what
had
he
promised
what
she
received
was
death
had
this
been
in
his
mind
would
this
have
been
the
termination
of
the
sentence
had
he
wakened
less
soon
to
consciousness
and
caution
sweetwater
dared
to
believe
it
he
was
no
nearer
comprehending
the
mystery
it
involved
than
he
had
been
before
but
he
felt
sure
that
he
had
been
given
one
true
and
positive
glimpse
into
this
harassed
soul
which
showed
its
deeply
hidden
secret
to
be
both
deadly
and
fearsome
and
happy
to
have
won
his
way
so
far
into
the
mystic
labyrinth
he
had
sworn
to
pierce
he
rested
in
happy
unconsciousness
till
morning
when
could
it
be
was
it
he
who
was
dreaming
now
or
was
the
event
of
the
night
a
mere
farce
of
his
own
imagining
brotherson
was
whistling
in
his
room
gaily
and
with
ever
increasing
verve
and
the
tune
which
filled
the
whole
floor
with
music
was
the
same
grand
finale
from
william
tell
which
had
seemed
to
work
such
magic
in
the
night
as
sweetwater
caught
the
mellow
but
indifferent
notes
sounding
from
those
lips
of
brass
he
dragged
forth
the
he
held
hidden
in
his
coat
pocket
and
flinging
it
on
the
floor
stamped
upon
it
the
man
is
too
strong
for
me
he
cried
his
heart
is
granite
he
meets
my
every
move
what
am
i
to
do
now
xix
the
danger
moment
for
a
day
sweetwater
acknowledged
himself
to
be
mentally
crushed
disillusioned
and
defeated
then
his
spirits
regained
their
poise
it
would
take
a
heavy
weight
indeed
to
keep
them
down
permanently
his
opinion
was
not
changed
in
regard
to
his
neighbour
s
secret
guilt
a
demeanour
of
this
sort
suggested
bravado
rather
than
bravery
to
the
ever
suspicious
detective
but
he
saw
very
plainly
by
this
time
that
he
would
have
to
employ
more
subtle
methods
yet
ere
his
hand
would
touch
the
goal
which
so
tantalisingly
eluded
him
his
work
at
the
bench
suffered
that
week
he
made
two
mistakes
but
by
saturday
night
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
he
had
reached
the
point
where
he
would
be
justified
in
making
use
of
miss
challoner
s
letters
so
he
telephoned
his
wishes
to
new
york
and
awaited
the
promised
developments
with
an
anxiety
we
can
only
understand
by
realising
how
much
greater
were
his
chances
of
failure
than
of
success
to
ensure
the
latter
every
factor
in
his
scheme
must
work
to
perfection
the
medium
of
communication
a
young
untried
girl
must
do
her
part
with
all
the
skill
of
artist
and
author
combined
would
she
disappoint
them
he
did
not
think
so
women
possess
a
marvellous
adaptability
for
this
kind
of
work
and
this
one
was
french
which
made
the
case
still
more
hopeful
but
brotherson
in
what
spirit
would
he
meet
the
proposed
advances
would
he
even
admit
the
girl
and
if
he
did
would
the
interview
bear
any
such
fruit
as
sweetwater
hoped
for
the
man
who
could
mock
the
terrors
of
the
night
by
a
careless
repetition
of
a
strain
instinct
with
the
most
sacred
memories
was
not
to
be
depended
upon
to
show
much
feeling
at
sight
of
a
departed
woman
s
writing
but
no
other
hope
remained
and
sweetwater
faced
the
attempt
with
heroic
determination
the
day
was
sunday
which
ensured
brotherson
s
being
at
home
nothing
would
have
lured
sweetwater
out
for
a
moment
though
he
had
no
reason
to
expect
that
the
affair
he
was
anticipating
would
come
off
till
early
evening
but
it
did
late
in
the
afternoon
he
heard
the
expected
steps
go
by
his
door
a
woman
s
steps
but
they
were
not
alone
a
man
s
accompanied
them
what
man
sweetwater
hastened
to
satisfy
himself
on
this
point
by
laying
his
ear
to
the
partition
instantly
the
whole
conversation
became
audible
an
errand
oh
yes
i
have
an
errand
explained
the
evidently
unwelcome
intruder
in
her
broken
english
this
is
my
brother
pierre
my
name
is
celeste
celeste
ledru
i
understand
english
ver
well
i
have
worked
much
in
families
but
he
understands
nothing
he
is
all
french
he
accompanies
me
for
for
the
what
you
call
it
les
convenances
he
knows
nothing
of
the
sweetwater
in
the
darkness
of
his
closet
laughed
in
his
gleeful
appreciation
great
was
his
comment
just
great
she
has
thought
of
everything
or
gryce
meanwhile
the
girl
was
proceeding
with
increased
volubility
what
is
this
beesiness
monsieur
i
have
something
to
sell
so
you
americans
speak
something
you
will
want
much
ver
sacred
ver
precious
a
souvenir
from
the
tomb
monsieur
will
you
give
ten
no
that
is
too
leetle
fifteen
dollars
for
it
it
is
worth
oh
more
much
more
to
the
true
lover
pierre
tu
es
bete
droit
sur
ta
chaise
brotherson
est
un
monsieur
comme
il
this
adjuration
uttered
in
sharp
reprimand
and
with
but
little
of
the
french
grace
may
or
may
not
have
been
understood
by
the
unsympathetic
man
they
were
meant
to
impress
but
the
name
which
accompanied
them
his
own
name
never
heard
but
once
before
in
this
house
undoubtedly
caused
the
silence
which
almost
reached
the
point
of
embarrassment
before
he
broke
it
with
the
harsh
remark
your
french
may
be
good
but
it
does
not
go
with
me
yet
is
it
more
intelligible
than
your
english
what
do
you
want
here
what
have
you
in
that
bag
you
wish
to
open
and
what
do
you
mean
by
the
sentimental
trash
with
which
you
offer
it
ah
monsieur
has
not
memory
of
me
came
in
the
sweetest
tones
of
a
really
seductive
voice
you
astonish
me
monsieur
i
thought
you
knew
everybody
else
does
oh
tout
le
monde
monsieur
that
i
was
miss
challoner
s
maid
near
her
when
other
people
were
not
near
her
the
very
day
she
a
pause
then
an
angry
exclamation
from
some
one
sweetwater
thought
from
the
brother
who
may
have
misinterpreted
some
look
or
gesture
on
brotherson
s
part
brotherson
himself
would
not
be
apt
to
show
surprise
in
any
such
noisy
way
i
saw
many
things
oh
many
things
the
girl
proceeded
with
an
admirable
mixture
of
suggestion
and
reserve
that
day
and
other
days
too
she
did
not
talk
oh
no
she
did
not
talk
but
i
saw
oh
yes
i
saw
that
she
that
you
i
ll
have
to
say
it
monsieur
that
you
were
tres
bons
amis
after
that
week
in
well
his
utterance
of
this
word
was
vigorous
but
not
tender
what
are
you
coming
to
what
can
you
have
to
show
me
in
this
connection
that
i
will
believe
in
for
a
moment
i
have
these
is
monsieur
certaine
that
no
one
can
hear
i
wouldn
t
have
anybody
hear
what
i
have
to
tell
you
for
the
world
for
all
the
no
one
can
for
the
first
time
that
day
sweetwater
breathed
a
full
deep
breath
this
assurance
had
sounded
heartfelt
blessings
on
her
cunning
young
head
she
thinks
of
you
are
unhappy
you
have
thought
miss
challoner
cold
that
she
had
no
response
for
your
ver
ardent
passion
but
these
words
were
uttered
sotto
voce
and
with
telling
pauses
but
i
know
ver
much
better
than
that
she
was
ver
proud
she
had
a
right
she
was
no
poor
girl
like
me
but
she
spend
hours
hours
in
writing
letters
she
nevaire
send
i
saw
one
just
once
for
a
leetle
minute
while
you
could
breathe
so
short
as
that
and
began
with
cheri
or
your
english
for
that
and
ended
with
words
oh
ver
much
like
these
you
may
nevaire
see
these
lines
which
was
ver
interesting
veree
so
and
made
one
want
to
see
what
she
did
with
letters
she
wrote
and
nevaire
mail
so
i
watch
and
look
and
one
day
i
see
them
she
had
a
leetle
ivory
box
oh
ver
nice
ver
pretty
i
thought
it
was
jewels
she
kept
locked
up
so
tight
but
non
non
non
it
was
letters
these
letters
i
heard
them
rattle
rattle
not
once
but
many
times
you
believe
me
monsieur
i
believe
you
to
have
taken
every
advantage
possible
to
spy
upon
your
mistress
i
believe
that
from
interest
monsieur
from
great
as
monsieur
pleases
but
it
was
strange
ver
strange
for
a
grande
dame
like
that
to
write
letters
sheets
on
sheets
and
then
not
send
them
nevaire
i
dreamed
of
those
letters
i
could
not
help
it
no
and
when
she
died
so
quick
with
no
word
for
any
one
no
word
at
all
i
thought
of
those
writings
so
secret
so
of
the
heart
and
when
no
one
noticed
or
thought
about
this
box
or
or
the
key
she
kept
shut
tight
oh
always
tight
in
her
leetle
gold
purse
i
monsieur
do
you
want
to
see
those
letters
asked
the
girl
with
a
gulp
evidently
his
appearance
frightened
her
or
had
her
acting
reached
this
point
of
extreme
finish
i
had
nevaire
the
chance
to
put
them
back
and
and
they
belong
to
monsieur
they
are
his
all
his
and
so
beautiful
ah
just
like
i
don
t
consider
them
mine
i
haven
t
a
particle
of
confidence
in
you
or
in
your
story
you
are
a
thief
or
you
re
an
agent
of
the
police
whose
motives
i
neither
understand
nor
care
to
investigate
take
up
your
bag
and
go
i
haven
t
a
cent
s
worth
of
interest
in
its
she
started
to
her
feet
sweetwater
heard
her
chair
grate
on
the
painted
floor
as
she
pushed
it
back
in
rising
the
brother
rose
too
but
more
calmly
brotherson
did
not
stir
sweetwater
felt
his
hopes
rapidly
dying
down
down
into
ashes
when
suddenly
her
voice
broke
forth
in
pants
and
marie
said
everybody
said
that
you
loved
our
great
lady
that
you
of
the
people
common
common
working
with
the
hands
living
with
men
and
women
working
with
the
hands
that
you
had
soul
sentiment
what
you
will
of
the
good
and
the
great
and
that
you
would
give
your
eyes
for
her
words
si
fines
si
spirituelles
so
like
des
vers
de
poete
false
false
all
false
she
was
an
angel
you
are
read
that
she
vehemently
broke
in
opening
her
bag
and
whisking
a
paper
down
before
him
read
and
understand
my
proud
and
lovely
lady
she
did
right
to
die
you
are
hard
hard
you
would
have
killed
her
if
she
had
not
silence
woman
i
will
read
nothing
came
hissing
from
the
strong
man
s
teeth
set
in
almost
ungovernable
anger
take
back
this
letter
as
you
call
it
and
leave
my
nevaire
you
will
not
read
but
you
shall
you
shall
behold
another
one
two
three
four
madly
they
flew
from
her
hand
madly
she
continued
her
vituperative
attack
beast
beast
that
she
should
pour
out
her
innocent
heart
to
you
you
i
do
not
want
your
money
monsieur
of
the
common
street
of
the
common
house
it
would
be
dirt
pierre
it
would
be
dirt
ah
bah
je
m
oublie
tout
a
fait
pierre
il
est
bete
il
refuse
de
les
toucher
mais
il
faut
qu
il
les
touche
si
je
les
laisse
sur
le
plancher
en
je
me
moque
de
lui
canaille
l
homme
du
peuple
tout
a
fait
du
peuple
a
loud
slam
the
skurrying
of
feet
through
the
hall
accompanied
by
the
slower
and
heavier
tread
of
the
brother
then
silence
and
such
silence
that
sweetwater
fancied
he
could
catch
the
sound
of
brotherson
s
heavy
breathing
his
own
was
silenced
to
a
gasp
what
a
treasure
of
a
girl
how
natural
her
indignation
what
an
instinct
she
showed
and
what
comprehension
this
high
and
mighty
handling
of
a
most
difficult
situation
and
a
most
difficult
man
had
imposed
on
brotherson
had
almost
imposed
upon
himself
those
letters
so
beautiful
so
spirituelle
yet
the
odds
were
that
she
had
never
read
them
much
less
abstracted
them
the
minx
the
ready
resourceful
wily
daring
minx
but
had
she
imposed
on
brotherson
as
the
silence
continued
sweetwater
began
to
doubt
he
understood
quite
well
the
importance
of
his
neighbour
s
first
movement
were
he
to
tear
those
letters
into
shreds
he
might
be
thus
tempted
all
depended
on
the
strength
of
his
present
mood
and
the
real
nature
of
the
secret
which
lay
buried
in
his
heart
was
that
heart
as
flinty
as
it
seemed
was
there
no
place
for
doubt
or
even
for
curiosity
in
its
impenetrable
depths
seemingly
he
had
not
moved
foot
or
hand
since
his
unwelcome
visitors
had
left
he
was
doubtless
still
staring
at
the
scattered
sheets
lying
before
him
possibly
battling
with
unaccustomed
impulses
possibly
weighing
deeds
and
consequences
in
those
slow
moving
scales
of
his
in
which
no
man
could
cast
a
weight
with
any
certainty
how
far
its
even
balance
would
be
disturbed
there
was
a
sound
as
of
settling
coal
only
at
night
would
one
expect
to
hear
so
slight
a
sound
as
that
in
a
tenement
full
of
noisy
children
but
the
moment
chanced
to
be
propitious
and
it
not
only
attracted
the
attention
of
sweetwater
on
his
side
of
the
wall
but
it
struck
the
ear
of
brotherson
also
with
an
ejaculation
as
bitter
as
it
was
impatient
he
roused
himself
and
gathered
up
the
letters
sweetwater
could
hear
the
successive
rustlings
as
he
bundled
them
up
in
his
hand
then
came
another
silence
then
the
lifting
of
a
stove
lid
sweetwater
had
not
been
wrong
in
his
secret
apprehension
his
identification
with
his
unimpressionable
neighbour
s
mood
had
shown
him
what
to
expect
these
letters
these
innocent
and
precious
outpourings
of
a
rare
and
womanly
soul
the
only
conceivable
open
sesame
to
the
nature
he
found
himself
pitted
against
would
soon
be
resolved
into
a
vanishing
puff
of
smoke
but
the
lid
was
thrust
back
and
the
letters
remained
in
hand
mortal
strength
has
its
limits
even
brotherson
could
not
shut
down
that
lid
on
words
which
might
have
been
meant
for
him
harshly
as
he
had
repelled
the
idea
the
pause
which
followed
told
little
but
when
sweetwater
heard
the
man
within
move
with
characteristic
energy
to
the
door
turn
the
key
and
step
back
again
to
his
place
at
the
table
he
knew
that
the
danger
moment
had
passed
and
that
those
letters
were
about
to
be
read
not
casually
but
seriously
as
indeed
their
contents
merited
this
caused
sweetwater
to
feel
serious
himself
upon
what
result
might
he
calculate
what
would
happen
to
this
hardy
soul
when
the
fact
he
so
scornfully
repudiated
was
borne
in
upon
him
and
he
saw
that
the
disdain
which
had
antagonised
him
was
a
mere
device
a
cloak
to
hide
the
secret
heart
of
love
and
eager
womanly
devotion
her
death
little
as
brotherson
would
believe
it
up
till
now
had
been
his
personal
loss
the
greatest
which
can
befall
a
man
when
he
came
to
see
this
when
the
modest
fervour
of
her
unusual
nature
began
to
dawn
upon
him
in
these
would
the
result
be
remorse
or
just
the
deadening
and
final
extinction
of
whatever
tenderness
he
may
have
retained
for
her
memory
impossible
to
tell
the
balance
of
probability
hung
even
sweetwater
recognised
this
and
clung
breathless
to
his
fain
would
he
have
seen
as
well
as
heard
brotherson
read
the
first
letter
standing
as
it
soon
became
public
property
i
will
give
it
here
just
as
it
afterwards
appeared
in
the
columns
of
the
greedy
journals
beloved
when
i
sit
as
i
often
do
in
perfect
quiet
under
the
stars
and
dream
that
you
are
looking
at
them
too
not
for
hours
as
i
do
but
for
one
full
moment
in
which
your
thoughts
are
with
me
as
wholly
as
mine
are
with
you
i
feel
that
the
bond
between
us
unseen
by
the
world
and
possibly
not
wholly
recognised
by
ourselves
is
instinct
with
the
same
power
which
links
together
the
eternities
it
seems
to
have
always
been
to
have
known
no
beginning
only
a
budding
an
efflorescence
the
visible
product
of
a
hidden
but
always
present
reality
a
month
ago
and
i
was
ignorant
even
of
your
name
now
you
seem
the
best
known
to
me
the
best
understood
of
god
s
creatures
one
afternoon
of
perfect
companionship
one
flash
of
strong
emotion
with
its
deep
true
insight
into
each
other
s
soul
and
the
miracle
was
wrought
we
had
met
and
henceforth
parting
would
mean
separation
only
and
not
the
severing
of
a
mutual
bond
one
hand
and
one
only
could
do
that
now
i
will
not
name
that
hand
for
us
there
is
nought
ahead
but
life
thus
do
i
ease
my
heart
in
the
silence
which
conditions
impose
upon
us
some
day
i
shall
hear
your
voice
again
and
the
paper
dropped
from
the
reader
s
hand
it
was
several
minutes
before
he
took
up
another
this
one
as
it
happened
antedated
the
other
as
will
appear
on
reading
it
my
friend
i
said
that
i
could
not
write
to
you
that
we
must
wait
you
were
willing
but
there
is
much
to
be
accomplished
and
the
silence
may
be
long
my
father
is
not
an
easy
man
to
please
but
he
desires
my
happiness
and
will
listen
to
my
plea
when
the
right
hour
comes
when
you
have
won
your
place
when
you
have
shown
yourself
to
be
the
man
i
feel
you
to
be
then
my
father
will
recognise
your
worth
and
the
way
will
be
cleared
despite
the
obstacles
which
now
intervene
but
meantime
ah
you
will
not
know
it
but
words
will
rise
the
heart
must
find
utterance
what
the
lip
can
not
utter
nor
the
looks
reveal
these
pages
shall
hold
in
sacred
trust
for
you
till
the
day
when
my
father
will
place
my
hand
in
yours
with
approval
is
it
a
folly
a
woman
s
weak
evasion
of
the
strong
silence
of
man
you
may
say
so
some
day
but
somehow
i
doubt
it
i
doubt
the
creaking
of
a
chair
the
man
within
had
seated
himself
there
was
no
other
sound
a
soul
in
turmoil
wakens
no
echoes
sweetwater
envied
the
walls
surrounding
the
unsympathetic
reader
they
could
see
he
could
only
listen
a
little
while
then
that
slight
rustling
again
of
the
unfolding
sheet
the
following
was
read
and
then
the
fourth
and
last
dearest
did
you
think
i
had
never
seen
you
till
that
day
we
met
in
lenox
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
secret
a
great
great
secret
such
a
one
as
a
woman
hardly
whispers
to
her
own
heart
one
day
in
early
summer
i
was
sitting
in
bartholomew
s
church
on
fifth
avenue
waiting
for
the
services
to
begin
it
was
early
and
the
congregation
was
assembling
while
idly
watching
the
people
coming
in
i
saw
a
gentleman
pass
by
me
up
the
aisle
who
made
me
forget
all
the
others
he
had
not
the
air
of
a
new
yorker
he
was
not
even
dressed
in
city
style
but
as
i
noted
his
face
and
expression
i
said
way
down
in
my
heart
that
is
the
kind
of
man
i
could
love
the
only
man
i
have
ever
seen
who
could
make
me
forget
my
own
world
and
my
own
it
was
a
passing
thought
soon
forgotten
but
when
in
that
hour
of
embarrassment
and
peril
on
greylock
mountain
i
looked
up
into
the
face
of
my
rescuer
and
saw
again
that
countenance
which
so
short
a
time
before
had
called
into
life
impulses
till
then
utterly
unknown
i
knew
that
my
hour
was
come
and
that
was
why
my
confidence
was
so
spontaneous
and
my
belief
in
the
future
so
absolute
i
trust
your
love
which
will
work
wonders
and
i
trust
my
own
which
sprang
at
a
look
but
only
gathered
strength
and
permanence
when
i
found
that
the
soul
of
the
man
i
loved
bettered
his
outward
attractions
making
the
ideal
of
my
foolish
girlhood
seem
as
unsubstantial
and
evanescent
as
a
dream
in
the
glowing
my
own
i
can
say
so
now
for
you
have
written
to
me
and
i
have
the
dancing
words
with
which
to
silence
any
unsought
doubt
which
might
subdue
the
exuberance
of
these
secret
outpourings
i
did
not
expect
this
i
thought
that
you
would
remain
as
silent
as
myself
but
men
s
ways
are
not
our
ways
they
can
not
exhaust
longing
in
purposeless
words
on
scraps
of
soulless
paper
and
i
am
glad
that
they
can
not
i
love
you
for
your
impatience
for
your
purpose
and
for
the
manliness
which
will
win
for
you
yet
all
that
you
covet
of
fame
accomplishment
and
love
you
expect
no
reply
but
there
are
ways
in
which
one
can
keep
silent
and
yet
speak
won
t
you
be
surprised
when
your
answer
comes
in
a
manner
you
have
never
thought
of
xx
confusion
in
his
interest
in
what
was
going
on
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
sweetwater
had
forgotten
himself
daylight
had
declined
but
in
the
darkness
of
the
closet
this
change
had
passed
unheeded
night
itself
might
come
but
that
should
not
force
him
to
leave
his
post
so
long
as
his
neighbour
remained
behind
his
locked
door
brooding
over
the
words
of
love
and
devotion
which
had
come
to
him
as
it
were
from
the
other
world
but
was
he
brooding
that
sound
of
iron
clattering
upon
iron
that
smothered
exclamation
and
the
laugh
which
ended
it
anger
and
determination
rang
in
that
laugh
it
had
a
hideous
sound
which
prepared
sweetwater
for
the
smell
which
now
reached
his
nostrils
the
letters
were
burning
this
time
the
lid
had
been
lifted
from
the
stove
with
unrelenting
purpose
poor
edith
challoner
s
touching
words
had
met
a
different
fate
from
any
which
she
in
her
ignorance
of
this
man
s
nature
a
nature
to
which
she
had
ascribed
untold
perfections
could
possibly
have
conceived
as
sweetwater
thought
of
this
he
stirred
nervously
in
the
darkness
and
broke
into
silent
invective
against
the
man
who
could
so
insult
the
memory
of
one
who
had
perished
under
the
blight
of
his
own
coldness
and
misunderstanding
then
he
suddenly
started
back
surprised
and
apprehensive
brotherson
had
unlocked
his
door
and
was
coming
rapidly
his
way
sweetwater
heard
his
step
in
the
hall
and
had
hardly
time
to
bound
from
his
closet
when
he
saw
his
own
door
burst
in
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
his
redoubtable
neighbour
in
a
state
of
such
rage
as
few
men
could
meet
without
quailing
even
were
they
of
his
own
stature
physical
vigour
and
prowess
and
sweetwater
was
a
small
man
however
disappointment
such
as
he
had
just
experienced
brings
with
it
a
desperation
which
often
outdoes
courage
and
the
detective
smiling
with
an
air
of
gay
surprise
shouted
out
well
what
s
the
matter
now
has
the
machine
busted
or
tumbled
into
the
fire
or
sailed
away
to
lands
unknown
out
of
your
open
window
you
were
coming
out
of
that
closet
was
the
fierce
rejoinder
what
have
you
got
there
something
which
concerns
me
or
why
should
your
face
go
pale
at
my
presence
and
your
forehead
drip
with
sweat
don
t
think
that
you
ve
deceived
me
for
a
moment
as
to
your
business
here
i
recognised
you
immediately
you
ve
played
the
stranger
well
but
you
ve
a
nose
and
an
eye
nobody
could
forget
i
have
known
all
along
that
i
had
a
police
spy
for
a
neighbour
but
it
didn
t
faze
me
i
ve
nothing
to
conceal
and
wouldn
t
mind
a
regiment
of
you
fellows
if
you
d
only
play
a
straight
game
but
when
it
comes
to
foisting
upon
me
a
parcel
of
letters
to
which
i
have
no
right
and
then
setting
a
fellow
like
you
to
count
my
groans
or
whatever
else
they
expected
to
hear
i
have
a
right
to
defend
myself
and
defend
myself
i
will
by
god
but
first
let
me
be
sure
that
my
accusations
will
stand
come
into
this
closet
with
me
it
abuts
on
the
wall
of
my
room
and
has
its
own
secret
i
know
what
is
it
i
have
you
at
an
advantage
now
and
you
shall
he
did
have
sweetwater
at
an
advantage
and
the
detective
knew
it
and
disdained
a
struggle
which
would
have
only
called
up
a
crowd
friendly
to
the
other
but
inimical
to
himself
allowing
brotherson
to
drag
him
into
the
closet
he
stood
quiescent
while
the
determined
man
who
held
him
with
one
hand
felt
about
with
the
other
over
the
shelves
and
along
the
partitions
till
he
came
to
the
hole
which
had
offered
such
a
happy
means
of
communication
between
the
two
rooms
then
with
a
laugh
almost
as
bitter
in
tone
as
that
which
rang
from
brotherson
s
lips
he
acknowledged
that
business
had
its
necessities
and
that
apologies
from
him
were
in
order
adding
as
they
both
stepped
out
into
the
rapidly
darkening
room
we
ve
played
a
bout
we
two
and
you
ve
come
out
ahead
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
brotherson
you
ve
cleared
yourself
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
leave
this
ranch
the
frown
had
come
back
to
the
forehead
of
the
indignant
man
who
confronted
him
so
you
listened
he
cried
listened
when
you
weren
t
sneaking
under
my
eye
a
fine
occupation
for
a
man
who
can
a
corner
like
an
adept
i
wish
i
had
let
you
join
the
brotherhood
you
were
good
enough
to
mention
they
would
know
how
to
appreciate
your
double
gifts
and
how
to
reward
your
excellence
in
the
one
if
not
in
the
other
what
did
the
police
expect
to
learn
about
me
that
they
should
consider
it
necessary
to
call
into
exercise
such
extraordinary
talents
i
m
not
good
at
conundrums
i
was
given
a
task
to
perform
and
i
performed
it
was
sweetwater
s
sturdy
reply
then
slowly
with
his
eye
fixed
directly
upon
his
antagonist
i
guess
they
thought
you
a
man
and
so
did
i
until
i
heard
you
burn
those
letters
fortunately
we
have
letters
fury
thickened
the
speaker
s
voice
and
lent
a
savage
gleam
to
his
eye
forgeries
make
believes
miss
challoner
never
wrote
the
drivel
you
dare
to
designate
as
letters
it
was
concocted
at
police
headquarters
they
made
me
tell
my
story
and
then
they
found
some
one
who
could
wield
the
poetic
pen
i
m
obliged
to
them
for
the
confidence
they
show
in
my
credulity
i
credit
miss
challoner
with
such
words
as
have
been
given
me
to
read
here
i
knew
the
lady
and
i
know
myself
nothing
that
passed
between
us
not
an
event
in
which
we
were
both
concerned
has
been
forgotten
by
me
and
no
feature
of
our
intercourse
fits
the
language
you
have
ascribed
to
her
on
the
contrary
there
is
a
lamentable
contradiction
between
facts
as
they
were
and
the
fancies
you
have
made
her
indulge
in
and
this
as
you
must
acknowledge
not
only
proves
their
falsity
but
exonerates
miss
challoner
from
all
possible
charge
of
yet
she
certainly
wrote
those
letters
we
had
them
from
challoner
the
woman
who
brought
them
was
really
her
maid
we
have
not
deceived
you
in
i
do
not
believe
it
was
not
offensively
said
but
the
conviction
it
expressed
was
absolute
sweetwater
recognised
the
tone
as
one
of
truth
and
inwardly
laid
down
his
arms
he
could
never
like
the
man
there
was
too
much
iron
in
his
fibre
but
he
had
to
acknowledge
that
as
a
foe
he
was
invulnerable
and
therefore
admirable
to
one
who
had
the
good
sense
to
appreciate
him
i
do
not
want
to
believe
thus
did
brotherson
supplement
his
former
sentence
for
if
i
were
to
attribute
those
letters
to
her
i
should
have
to
acknowledge
that
they
were
written
to
another
man
than
myself
and
this
would
be
anything
but
agreeable
to
me
now
i
am
going
to
my
room
and
to
my
work
you
may
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
or
the
whole
night
if
you
will
listening
at
that
hole
as
heretofore
the
labour
will
be
all
yours
and
the
indifference
with
a
satirical
play
of
feature
which
could
hardly
be
called
a
smile
he
nodded
and
left
the
room
xxi
a
change
it
s
all
up
i
m
beaten
on
my
own
thus
confessed
sweetwater
in
great
dejection
to
himself
but
i
m
going
to
take
advantage
of
the
permission
he
s
just
given
me
and
continue
the
listening
act
just
because
he
told
me
to
and
just
because
he
thinks
i
won
t
i
m
sure
it
s
no
worse
than
to
spend
hours
of
restless
tossing
in
bed
trying
to
but
our
young
detective
did
neither
as
he
was
putting
his
supper
dishes
away
a
messenger
boy
knocked
at
his
door
and
handed
him
a
note
it
was
from
gryce
and
ran
thus
steal
off
if
you
can
and
as
soon
as
you
can
and
meet
me
in
street
a
discovery
has
been
made
which
alters
the
whole
xxii
o
b
again
what
s
happened
something
very
important
i
ought
to
hope
so
after
this
confounded
failure
didn
t
he
read
the
letters
yes
he
read
them
had
to
but
didn
t
weaken
eh
no
he
didn
t
weaken
you
can
t
get
water
out
of
a
millstone
you
may
squeeze
and
squeeze
but
it
s
your
fingers
which
suffer
not
it
he
thinks
we
manufactured
those
letters
ourselves
on
purpose
to
draw
humph
i
knew
we
had
a
reputation
for
finesse
but
i
didn
t
know
that
it
ran
that
he
denies
everything
said
she
would
never
have
written
such
letters
to
him
even
goes
so
far
to
declare
that
if
she
did
write
them
he
must
be
strangely
ignorant
of
her
handwriting
they
were
meant
for
some
other
man
than
himself
all
rot
but
a
hitch
of
the
shoulder
conveyed
sweetwater
s
disgust
his
uniform
good
nature
was
strangely
disturbed
but
gryce
s
was
not
the
faint
smile
with
which
he
smoothed
with
an
easy
circling
movement
the
already
polished
top
of
his
ever
present
cane
conveyed
a
secret
complacency
which
called
up
a
flash
of
discomfiture
to
his
greatly
irritated
companion
he
says
that
does
he
you
found
him
on
the
whole
tolerably
straightforward
eh
a
hard
nut
but
hard
nuts
are
usually
sound
ones
come
now
prejudice
aside
what
s
your
honest
opinion
of
the
man
you
ve
had
under
your
eye
and
ear
for
three
solid
weeks
hasn
t
there
been
the
best
of
reasons
for
your
failure
speak
up
my
boy
squarely
i
can
t
i
hate
the
fellow
i
hate
any
one
who
makes
me
look
ridiculous
he
well
well
if
you
ll
have
it
sir
i
will
say
this
much
if
it
weren
t
for
that
blasted
coincidence
of
the
two
deaths
equally
mysterious
equally
under
his
eye
i
d
stake
my
life
on
his
honesty
but
that
coincidence
stumps
me
and
and
a
sort
of
feeling
i
have
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
slap
he
gave
his
breast
at
this
point
carried
off
some
of
his
superfluous
emotion
you
can
t
account
for
a
feeling
gryce
the
man
has
no
heart
he
s
as
hard
as
a
not
uncommon
lack
where
the
head
plays
so
big
a
part
we
can
t
hang
him
on
any
such
argument
as
that
you
ve
found
no
evidence
against
him
n
the
hesitating
admission
was
only
a
proof
of
sweetwater
s
obstinacy
then
listen
to
this
the
test
with
the
letters
failed
because
what
he
said
about
them
was
true
they
were
not
meant
for
him
miss
challoner
had
another
only
another
i
thought
there
were
a
at
another
whom
she
favoured
the
letters
found
in
her
possession
not
the
ones
she
wrote
herself
but
those
which
were
written
to
her
over
the
signature
o
were
not
all
from
the
same
hand
experts
have
been
busy
with
them
for
a
week
and
their
reports
are
unanimous
the
o
who
wrote
the
threatening
lines
acknowledged
to
by
orlando
brotherson
was
not
the
o
who
penned
all
of
those
love
letters
the
similarity
in
the
writing
misled
us
at
first
but
once
the
doubt
was
raised
by
challoner
s
discovery
of
an
allusion
in
one
of
them
which
pointed
to
another
writer
than
brotherson
and
experts
had
no
difficulty
in
reaching
the
decision
i
have
two
isn
t
that
incredible
gryce
yes
it
is
incredible
but
the
incredible
is
not
the
impossible
the
man
you
ve
been
shadowing
denies
that
these
expressive
effusions
of
miss
challoner
were
meant
for
him
let
us
see
then
if
we
can
find
the
man
they
were
meant
the
second
o
sweetwater
s
face
instantly
lit
up
do
you
mean
that
i
after
my
egregious
failure
am
not
to
be
kept
on
the
dunce
s
seat
that
you
will
give
me
this
new
job
yes
we
don
t
know
of
a
better
man
it
isn
t
your
fault
you
said
it
yourself
that
water
couldn
t
be
squeezed
out
of
a
the
superintendent
how
does
he
feel
about
it
he
was
the
first
one
to
mention
and
the
inspector
is
glad
to
see
us
on
a
new
a
pause
during
which
the
eager
light
in
the
young
detective
s
eye
clouded
over
presently
he
remarked
how
will
the
finding
of
another
o
alter
brotherson
s
position
he
still
will
be
the
one
person
on
the
spot
known
to
have
cherished
a
grievance
against
the
victim
of
this
mysterious
killing
to
my
mind
this
discovery
of
a
more
favoured
rival
brings
in
an
element
of
motive
which
may
rob
our
friend
of
some
of
his
complacency
we
may
further
rather
than
destroy
our
case
against
brotherson
by
locating
a
second
gryce
s
eyes
twinkled
that
won
t
make
your
task
any
more
irksome
he
smiled
the
loop
we
thus
throw
out
is
as
likely
to
catch
brotherson
as
his
rival
it
all
depends
upon
the
sort
of
man
we
find
in
this
second
o
and
whether
in
some
way
unknown
to
us
he
gave
her
cause
for
the
sudden
and
overwhelming
rush
of
despair
which
alone
supports
this
general
theory
of
the
prospect
grows
pleasing
where
am
i
to
look
for
my
man
your
ticket
is
bought
to
derby
pennsylvania
if
he
is
not
employed
in
the
great
factories
there
we
do
not
know
where
to
find
him
we
have
no
other
i
see
it
s
a
short
journey
i
have
before
it
ll
bring
the
colour
to
your
oh
i
m
not
you
will
start
wish
it
were
and
you
will
first
inquire
not
for
o
that
s
too
indefinite
but
for
a
young
girl
by
the
name
of
doris
scott
she
holds
the
clew
or
rather
she
is
the
clew
to
this
second
another
woman
no
a
child
well
i
won
t
say
child
exactly
she
must
be
doris
she
lives
in
derby
derby
is
a
small
place
you
will
have
no
trouble
in
finding
this
child
it
was
to
her
miss
challoner
s
last
letter
was
addressed
the
one
i
begin
to
no
you
don
t
sweetwater
the
affair
is
as
blind
as
your
hat
nobody
sees
we
re
just
feeling
along
a
thread
s
letters
the
real
o
i
mean
are
the
manliest
effusions
possible
he
s
no
more
of
a
milksop
than
this
brotherson
and
unlike
your
indomitable
friend
he
seems
to
have
some
heart
i
only
wish
he
d
given
us
some
facts
they
would
have
been
serviceable
but
the
letters
reveal
nothing
except
that
he
knew
doris
he
writes
in
one
of
them
doris
is
learning
to
embroider
it
s
like
a
fairy
weaving
a
cobweb
doris
isn
t
a
very
common
name
she
must
be
the
same
little
girl
to
whom
miss
challoner
wrote
from
time
to
was
this
letter
signed
o
yes
they
all
are
the
only
difference
between
his
letters
and
brotherson
s
is
this
brotherson
s
retain
the
date
and
address
the
second
s
do
how
not
torn
off
do
you
mean
yes
or
rather
neatly
cut
away
and
as
none
of
the
envelopes
were
kept
the
only
means
by
which
we
can
locate
the
writer
is
through
this
girl
if
i
remember
rightly
miss
challoner
s
letter
to
this
child
was
free
from
all
quite
so
it
is
as
open
as
the
day
that
is
why
it
has
been
mentioned
as
showing
the
freedom
of
miss
challoner
s
mind
five
minutes
before
that
fatal
sweetwater
took
up
the
sheet
gryce
pushed
towards
him
and
these
lines
dear
little
doris
it
is
a
snowy
night
but
it
is
all
bright
inside
and
i
feel
no
chill
in
mind
or
body
i
hope
it
is
so
in
the
little
cottage
in
derby
that
my
little
friend
is
as
happy
with
harsh
winds
blowing
from
the
mountains
as
she
was
on
the
summer
day
she
came
to
see
me
at
this
hotel
i
like
to
think
of
her
as
cheerful
and
beaming
rejoicing
in
tasks
which
make
her
so
womanly
and
sweet
she
is
often
often
in
my
mind
affectionately
your
friend
edith
that
to
a
child
of
sixteen
just
spells
something
besides
yet
there
is
a
doris
remember
that
o
says
in
one
of
his
letters
doris
is
learning
to
yes
i
remember
so
you
must
first
find
very
good
and
as
miss
challoner
s
letter
was
directed
to
derby
pennsylvania
you
will
go
to
yes
anything
more
i
ve
been
reading
this
letter
it
s
worth
the
last
sentence
expresses
a
that
has
been
sweetwater
s
eyes
slowly
rose
till
they
rested
on
gryce
s
face
i

cling
to
the
thread
you
ve
given
me
i
ll
work
myself
through
the
labyrinth
before
us
till
i
reach
gryce

but
there
was
more

wisdom
and
sympathy
for
youthful
enthusiasm
in
that
smile
than
there
was

book
iii
the
heart
of
man
xxiii
doris
a
young
girl
named
doris
scott
the
looked
somewhat
sharply
at
the
man
he
was
addressing
and
decided
to
give
the
direction
asked
there
is
but
one
young
girl
in
town
of
that
name
he
declared
and
she
lives
in
that
little
house
you
see
just
beyond
the
works
but
let
me
tell
you
stranger
he
went
on
with
some
precipitation
but
here
he
was
called
off
and
sweetwater
lost
the
conclusion
of
his
warning
if
warning
it
was
meant
to
be
this
did
not
trouble
the
detective
he
stood
a
moment
taking
in
the
prospect
decided
that
the
works
and
the
works
alone
made
the
town
and
started
for
the
house
which
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
his
way
lay
through
the
chief
business
street
and
greatly
preoccupied
by
his
errand
he
gave
but
a
passing
glance
to
the
rows
on
rows
of
workmen
s
dwellings
stretching
away
to
the
left
in
seemingly
endless
perspective
yet
in
that
glance
he
certainly
took
in
the
fact
that
the
sidewalks
were
blocked
with
people
and
wondered
if
it
were
a
holiday
if
so
it
must
be
an
enforced
one
for
the
faces
showed
little
joy
possibly
a
strike
was
on
the
anxiety
he
everywhere
saw
pictured
on
young
faces
and
old
argued
some
trouble
but
if
the
trouble
was
that
why
were
all
heads
turned
indifferently
from
the
works
and
why
were
the
works
themselves
in
full
blast
these
questions
he
may
have
asked
himself
and
he
may
not
his
attention
was
entirely
centred
on
the
house
he
saw
before
him
and
on
the
possible
developments
awaiting
him
there
nothing
else
mattered
briskly
he
stepped
out
along
the
sandy
road
and
after
a
turn
or
two
which
led
him
quite
away
from
the
works
and
its
surrounding
buildings
he
came
out
upon
the
highway
and
this
house
it
was
a
low
and
unpretentious
one
and
had
but
one
distinguishing
feature
the
porch
which
hung
well
over
the
doorstep
was
unique
in
shape
and
gave
an
air
of
picturesqueness
to
an
otherwise
simple
exterior
a
picturesqueness
which
was
much
enhanced
in
its
effect
by
the
background
of
illimitable
forest
which
united
the
foreground
of
this
pleasing
picture
with
the
great
chain
of
hills
which
held
the
works
and
town
in
its
ample
basin
as
he
approached
the
doorstep
his
mind
involuntarily
formed
an
anticipatory
image
of
the
child
whose
first
stitches
in
embroidery
were
like
a
fairy
s
weaving
to
the
strong
man
who
worked
in
ore
and
possibly
figured
out
bridges
that
she
would
prove
to
be
of
the
anemic
type
common
among
working
girls
gifted
with
an
imagination
they
have
but
scant
opportunity
to
exercise
he
had
little
doubt
he
was
therefore
greatly
taken
aback
when
at
his
first
step
upon
the
porch
the
door
before
him
flew
open
and
he
beheld
in
the
dark
recess
beyond
a
young
woman
of
such
bright
and
blooming
beauty
that
he
hardly
noticed
her
expression
of
extreme
anxiety
till
she
lifted
her
hand
and
laid
an
admonitory
finger
softly
on
her
lip
hush
she
whispered
with
an
earnestness
which
roused
him
from
his
absorption
and
restored
him
to
the
full
meaning
of
this
encounter
there
is
sickness
in
the
house
and
we
are
very
anxious
is
your
errand
an
important
one
if
not
the
faltering
break
in
the
fresh
young
voice
the
look
she
cast
behind
her
into
the
darkened
interior
were
eloquent
with
the
hope
that
he
would
recognise
her
impatience
and
pass
on
and
so
he
might
have
done
so
he
would
have
done
under
all
ordinary
circumstances
but
if
this
was
doris
and
he
did
not
doubt
the
fact
after
the
first
moment
of
startled
surprise
how
dare
he
forego
this
opportunity
of
settling
the
question
which
had
brought
him
here
with
a
slight
stammer
but
otherwise
giving
no
evidence
of
the
effect
made
upon
him
by
the
passionate
intensity
with
which
she
had
urged
this
plea
he
assured
her
that
his
errand
was
important
but
one
so
quickly
told
that
it
would
delay
her
but
a
moment
but
first
said
he
with
very
natural
caution
let
me
make
sure
that
it
is
to
miss
doris
scott
i
am
speaking
my
errand
is
to
her
and
her
without
showing
any
surprise
perhaps
too
engrossed
in
her
own
thoughts
to
feel
any
she
answered
with
simple
directness
yes
i
am
doris
whereupon
he
became
his
most
persuasive
self
and
pulling
out
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
opened
it
and
held
it
before
her
with
these
words
then
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
glance
at
this
letter
and
tell
me
if
the
person
whose
initials
you
will
find
at
the
bottom
happens
to
be
in
town
at
the
present
moment
in
some
astonishment
now
she
glanced
down
at
the
sheet
thus
boldly
thrust
before
her
and
recognising
the
o
and
the
b
of
a
signature
she
flashed
a
look
back
at
sweetwater
in
which
he
read
a
confusion
of
emotions
for
which
he
was
hardly
prepared
ah
thought
he
it
s
coming
in
another
moment
i
shall
hear
what
will
repay
me
for
the
trials
and
disappointments
of
all
these
but
the
moment
passed
and
he
had
heard
nothing
instead
she
dropped
her
hands
from
the
and
gave
such
unmistakable
evidences
of
intended
flight
that
but
one
alternative
remained
to
him
he
became
abrupt
thrusting
the
paper
still
nearer
he
said
with
an
emphasis
which
could
not
fail
of
making
an
impression
read
it
read
the
whole
letter
you
will
find
your
name
there
this
communication
was
addressed
to
miss
challoner
but
oh
now
she
found
words
with
a
low
cry
she
put
out
her
hand
in
quick
entreaty
begging
him
to
desist
and
not
speak
that
name
on
any
pretext
or
for
any
purpose
he
may
rouse
and
hear
she
explained
with
another
quick
look
behind
her
the
doctor
says
that
this
is
the
critical
day
he
may
become
conscious
any
minute
if
he
should
and
were
to
hear
that
name
it
might
kill
he
sweetwater
perked
up
his
ears
who
do
you
mean
by
he
mr
brotherson
my
patient
he
whose
letter
but
here
her
impatience
rose
above
every
other
consideration
without
attempting
to
finish
her
sentence
or
yielding
in
the
least
to
her
curiosity
or
interest
in
this
man
s
errand
she
cried
out
with
smothered
intensity
go
go
i
can
not
stay
another
moment
from
his
but
a
thunderbolt
could
not
have
moved
sweetwater
after
the
hearing
of
that
name
mr
brotherson
he
echoed
brotherson
not
orlando
no
no
his
name
is
oswald
he
s
the
manager
of
these
works
he
s
sick
with
typhoid
we
are
caring
for
him
if
you
belonged
here
you
would
know
that
much
there
that
s
his
voice
you
hear
go
if
you
have
any
and
she
began
to
push
to
the
door
but
sweetwater
was
impervious
to
all
hint
with
eager
eyes
straining
into
the
shadowy
depths
just
visible
over
her
shoulder
he
listened
eagerly
for
the
disjointed
words
now
plainly
to
be
heard
in
some
but
unseen
chamber
the
second
o
he
inwardly
declared
and
he
s
a
brotherson
also
and
sick
miss
scott
he
whisperingly
entreated
as
her
hand
fell
in
manifest
despair
from
the
door
don
t
send
me
away
yet
i
ve
a
question
of
the
greatest
importance
to
put
you
and
one
minute
more
can
not
make
any
difference
to
him
listen
those
cries
are
the
cries
of
delirium
he
can
not
miss
you
he
s
not
even
he
s
calling
out
in
his
sleep
he
s
calling
her
just
as
he
has
called
for
the
last
two
weeks
but
he
will
wake
conscious
or
he
will
not
wake
at
the
anguish
trembling
in
that
latter
phrase
would
have
attracted
sweetwater
s
earnest
if
not
pitiful
attention
at
any
other
time
but
now
he
had
ears
only
for
the
cry
which
at
that
moment
came
ringing
shrilly
from
within
edith
edith
the
living
shouting
for
the
dead
a
heart
still
warm
sending
forth
its
longing
to
the
pierced
and
pulseless
one
hidden
in
a
tomb
to
sweetwater
who
had
seen
miss
challoner
buried
this
summons
of
distracted
love
came
with
weird
force
then
the
present
regained
its
sway
he
heard
her
name
again
and
this
time
it
sounded
less
like
a
call
and
more
like
the
welcoming
cry
of
meeting
spirits
was
death
to
end
this
separation
had
he
found
the
true
o
only
to
behold
another
and
final
seal
fall
upon
this
closely
folded
mystery
in
his
fear
of
this
possibility
he
caught
at
doris
hand
as
she
was
about
to
bound
away
and
eagerly
asked
when
was
brotherson
taken
ill
tell
me
i
entreat
you
the
exact
day
and
if
you
can
the
exact
hour
more
depends
upon
this
than
you
can
readily
she
wrenched
her
hand
from
his
panting
with
impatience
and
a
vague
alarm
but
she
answered
him
distinctly
on
the
of
last
month
just
an
hour
after
he
was
made
manager
he
fell
in
a
faint
at
the
the
day
the
very
day
of
miss
challoner
s
death
had
he
heard
did
you
tell
him
then
or
afterwards
what
happened
in
new
york
on
that
very
date
no
no
we
have
not
told
him
it
would
have
killed
him
and
may
edith
edith
came
again
through
the
hush
a
hush
so
deep
that
sweetwater
received
the
impression
that
the
house
was
empty
save
for
patient
and
nurse
this
discovery
had
its
effects
upon
him
why
should
he
subject
this
young
and
loving
girl
to
further
pain
he
had
already
learned
more
than
he
had
expected
to
the
rest
would
come
with
time
but
at
the
first
intimation
he
gave
of
leaving
she
lost
her
abstracted
air
and
turned
with
absolute
eagerness
towards
him
one
moment
said
she
you
are
a
stranger
and
i
do
not
know
your
name
or
your
purpose
here
but
i
can
not
let
you
go
without
begging
you
not
to
mention
to
any
one
in
this
town
that
brotherson
has
any
interest
in
the
lady
whose
name
we
must
not
speak
do
not
repeat
that
delirious
cry
you
have
heard
or
betray
in
any
way
our
intense
and
fearful
interest
in
this
young
lady
s
strange
death
you
have
shown
me
a
letter
do
not
speak
of
that
letter
i
entreat
you
help
us
to
retain
our
secret
a
little
longer
only
the
doctor
and
myself
know
what
awaits
brotherson
if
he
lives
i
had
to
tell
the
doctor
but
a
doctor
reveals
nothing
promise
that
you
will
not
either
at
least
till
this
crisis
is
passed
it
will
help
my
father
and
it
will
help
me
and
we
need
all
the
help
we
can
sweetwater
allowed
himself
one
minute
of
thought
then
he
earnestly
replied
i
will
keep
your
secret
for
and
longer
if
thank
you
she
cried
thank
you
i
thought
i
saw
kindness
in
your
and
she
again
prepared
to
close
the
door
but
sweetwater
had
one
more
question
to
ask
pardon
me
said
he
as
he
stepped
down
on
the
walk
you
say
that
this
is
a
critical
day
with
your
patient
is
that
why
every
one
whom
i
have
seen
so
far
wears
such
a
look
of
anxiety
yes
yes
she
cried
giving
him
one
other
glimpse
of
her
lovely
agitated
face
there
s
but
one
feeling
in
town
but
one
hope
and
as
i
believe
but
one
prayer
that
the
man
whom
every
one
loves
and
every
one
trusts
may
live
to
run
these
edith
edith
rose
in
ceaseless
reiteration
from
within
but
it
rang
but
faintly
now
in
the
ears
of
our
detective
the
door
had
fallen
to
and
sweetwater
s
share
in
the
anxieties
of
that
household
was
over
slowly
he
moved
away
he
was
in
a
confused
yet
elated
condition
of
mind
here
was
food
for
a
thousand
new
thoughts
and
conjectures
an
orlando
brotherson
and
an
oswald
brotherson
relatives
possibly
strangers
possibly
but
whether
relatives
or
strangers
both
given
to
signing
their
letters
with
their
initials
simply
and
both
the
acknowledged
admirers
of
the
deceased
miss
challoner
but
she
had
loved
only
one
and
that
one
oswald
it
not
difficult
to
recognise
the
object
of
this
high
hearted
woman
s
affections
in
this
man
whose
struggle
with
the
had
awakened
the
solicitude
of
a
whole
town
xxiv
suspense
ten
minutes
after
sweetwater
s
arrival
in
the
village
streets
he
was
at
home
with
the
people
he
found
there
his
conversation
with
doris
in
the
doorway
of
her
home
had
been
observed
by
the
curious
and
and
the
questions
asked
and
answered
had
made
him
friends
at
once
of
course
he
could
tell
them
nothing
but
that
did
not
matter
he
had
seen
and
talked
with
doris
and
their
idolised
young
manager
was
no
worse
and
might
possibly
soon
be
better
of
his
own
affairs
of
his
business
with
doris
and
the
manager
they
asked
nothing
all
ordinary
interests
were
lost
in
the
stress
of
their
great
suspense
it
was
the
same
in
the
of
the
one
hotel
without
resorting
to
more
than
a
question
or
two
he
readily
learned
all
that
was
generally
known
of
oswald
brotherson
every
one
was
talking
about
him
and
each
had
some
story
to
tell
illustrative
of
his
kindness
his
courage
and
his
quick
mind
the
works
had
never
produced
a
man
of
such
varied
capabilities
and
all
round
sympathies
to
have
him
for
manager
meant
the
greatest
good
which
could
befall
this
little
community
his
rise
had
been
rapid
he
had
come
from
the
east
three
years
before
new
to
the
work
now
he
was
the
one
man
there
of
his
relationships
east
family
or
otherwise
nothing
was
said
for
them
his
life
began
and
ended
in
derby
and
sweetwater
could
see
though
no
actual
expression
was
given
to
the
feeling
that
there
was
but
one
expectation
in
regard
to
him
and
doris
to
whose
uncommon
beauty
and
sweetness
they
all
seemed
fully
alive
and
sweetwater
wondered
as
many
of
us
have
wondered
at
the
gulf
frequently
existing
between
fancy
and
fact
later
there
came
a
small
excitement
the
doctor
was
seen
riding
by
on
his
way
to
the
sick
man
from
the
window
where
he
sat
sweetwater
watched
him
pass
up
the
street
and
take
the
road
he
had
himself
so
lately
traversed
it
was
so
straight
a
one
and
led
so
directly
northward
that
he
could
follow
with
his
eye
the
doctor
s
whole
course
and
even
get
a
glimpse
of
his
figure
as
he
stepped
from
the
buggy
and
proceeded
to
tie
up
the
horse
there
was
an
energy
about
him
pleasing
to
sweetwater
he
might
have
much
to
do
with
this
doctor
if
oswald
brotherson
died
but
he
was
not
willing
to
consider
this
possibility
yet
his
personal
sympathies
to
say
nothing
of
his
professional
interest
in
the
mystery
to
which
this
man
and
this
man
only
possibly
held
the
key
alike
forbade
he
would
hope
as
these
others
were
hoping
and
if
he
did
not
count
the
minutes
he
at
least
saw
every
move
of
the
old
horse
waiting
with
drooping
head
and
the
resignation
of
long
custom
for
the
of
his
master
with
his
news
of
life
or
death
and
so
an
hour
two
hours
passed
others
were
watching
the
old
horse
now
the
street
showed
many
an
eager
figure
with
head
turned
northward
from
the
open
women
stepped
looked
in
the
direction
of
their
anxiety
and
retreated
to
their
work
again
suspense
was
everywhere
the
moments
dragged
like
hours
it
became
so
keen
at
last
that
some
impatient
hearts
could
no
longer
stand
it
a
woman
put
her
baby
into
another
woman
s
arms
and
hurried
up
the
road
another
followed
then
another
then
an
old
man
bowed
with
years
and
of
tottering
steps
began
to
go
that
way
halting
a
dozen
times
before
he
reached
the
group
now
collected
in
the
dusty
highway
near
but
not
too
near
that
house
as
sweetwater
s
own
enthusiasm
swelled
at
this
sight
he
thought
of
the
other
brotherson
with
his
theories
and
active
advocacy
for
reform
and
wondered
if
men
and
women
would
forego
their
meals
and
stand
for
hours
in
the
keen
spring
wind
just
to
be
the
first
to
hear
if
he
were
to
live
or
die
he
knew
that
he
himself
would
not
but
he
had
suffered
much
both
in
his
pride
and
his
purse
at
the
hands
of
the
brooklyn
inventor
and
such
despoliation
is
not
a
reliable
basis
for
sympathy
he
was
questioning
his
own
judgment
in
this
matter
and
losing
himself
in
the
mazes
of
past
doubts
and
conjectures
when
a
sudden
change
took
place
in
the
aspect
of
the
street
he
saw
people
running
and
in
another
moment
saw
why
the
doctor
had
shown
himself
on
the
porch
which
all
were
watching
was
he
coming
out
no
he
stands
quite
still
runs
his
eye
over
the
people
waiting
quietly
in
the
road
and
beckons
to
one
of
the
smaller
boys
the
child
with
upturned
face
stands
listening
to
what
he
has
to
say
then
starts
on
a
run
for
the
village
he
is
stopped
pulled
about
questioned
and
allowed
to
run
on
many
rush
forth
to
meet
him
he
is
panting
but
gleeful
brotherson
has
waked
up
conscious
and
the
doctor
says
he
will
live
xxv
the
oval
hut
that
night
fenton
had
a
visitor
we
know
that
visitor
and
we
almost
know
what
his
questions
were
if
not
the
answers
of
the
good
doctor
nevertheless
it
may
be
better
to
listen
to
a
part
at
least
of
their
conversation
sweetwater
who
knew
when
to
be
frank
and
open
as
well
as
when
to
be
reserved
and
ambiguous
made
no
effort
to
disguise
the
nature
of
his
business
or
his
chief
cause
of
interest
in
oswald
brotherson
the
eye
which
met
his
was
too
penetrating
not
to
detect
the
smallest
attempt
at
subterfuge
besides
sweetwater
had
no
need
to
hide
his
errand
it
was
one
of
peace
and
it
threatened
nobody
the
more
s
the
pity
thought
he
in
uneasy
comment
to
himself
as
he
realised
the
hopelessness
of
the
whole
situation
his
first
word
therefore
was
a
plain
announcement
dr
fenton
my
name
is
sweetwater
i
am
from
new
york
and
represent
for
the
nonce
challoner
whose
name
i
have
simply
to
mention
for
you
to
understand
that
my
business
is
with
brotherson
whom
i
am
sorry
to
find
seriously
if
not
dangerously
will
you
tell
me
how
long
you
think
it
will
be
before
i
can
have
a
talk
with
him
on
a
subject
which
i
will
not
disguise
from
you
may
prove
a
very
exciting
one
weeks
weeks
returned
the
doctor
mr
brotherson
has
been
a
very
sick
man
and
the
only
hope
i
have
of
his
recovery
is
the
fact
that
he
is
ignorant
of
his
trouble
or
that
he
has
any
cause
for
doubt
or
dread
were
this
happy
condition
of
things
to
be
disturbed
were
the
faintest
rumour
of
sorrow
or
disaster
to
reach
him
in
his
present
weakened
state
i
should
fear
a
relapse
with
all
its
attendant
dangers
what
then
if
any
intimation
should
be
given
him
of
the
horrible
tragedy
suggested
by
the
name
you
have
mentioned
the
man
would
die
before
your
eyes
challoner
s
business
will
have
to
that
i
see
but
if
i
knew
when
i
might
speak
i
can
give
you
no
date
typhoid
is
a
treacherous
complaint
he
has
the
best
of
nurses
and
the
chances
are
in
favour
of
a
quick
recovery
but
we
never
can
be
sure
you
had
better
return
to
new
york
later
you
can
write
me
if
you
wish
or
challoner
can
you
may
have
confidence
in
my
reply
it
will
not
mislead
sweetwater
muttered
his
thanks
and
rose
then
he
slowly
sat
down
again
dr
fenton
he
began
you
are
a
man
to
be
trusted
i
m
in
a
devil
of
a
fix
and
there
is
just
a
possibility
that
you
may
be
able
to
help
me
out
it
is
the
general
opinion
in
new
york
as
you
may
know
that
miss
challoner
committed
suicide
but
the
circumstances
do
not
fully
bear
out
this
theory
nor
can
challoner
be
made
to
accept
it
indeed
he
is
so
convinced
of
its
falsehood
that
he
stands
ready
to
do
anything
pay
anything
suffer
anything
to
have
this
distressing
blight
removed
from
his
daughter
s
good
name
brotherson
was
her
dearest
friend
and
as
such
may
have
the
clew
to
this
mystery
but
brotherson
may
not
be
in
a
condition
to
speak
for
several
weeks
meanwhile
challoner
must
suffer
from
great
suspense
unless
a
pause
during
which
he
searched
the
doctor
s
face
with
a
perfectly
frank
and
inquiring
expression
unless
some
one
else
can
help
us
out
fenton
can
you
the
doctor
did
not
need
to
speak
his
expression
conveyed
his
answer
no
more
than
another
said
he
except
for
what
doris
felt
compelled
to
tell
me
i
know
as
little
as
yourself
brotherson
s
delirium
took
the
form
of
calling
continually
upon
one
name
i
did
not
know
this
name
but
doris
did
also
the
danger
lurking
in
the
fact
that
he
had
yet
to
hear
of
the
tragedy
which
had
robbed
him
of
this
woman
to
whom
he
was
so
deeply
attached
so
she
told
me
just
this
much
that
the
edith
whose
name
rung
so
continuously
in
our
ears
was
no
other
than
the
miss
challoner
of
new
york
of
whose
death
and
its
tragic
circumstances
the
papers
have
been
full
that
their
engagement
was
a
secret
one
unshared
so
far
as
she
knew
by
any
one
but
herself
that
she
begged
me
to
preserve
this
secret
and
to
give
her
all
the
help
i
could
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
ask
questions
especially
did
she
entreat
me
to
be
with
her
at
the
crisis
i
was
but
his
waking
was
quite
natural
he
did
not
ask
for
miss
challoner
he
only
inquired
how
long
he
had
been
ill
and
whether
doris
had
received
a
letter
during
that
time
she
had
not
received
one
a
fact
which
seemed
to
disappoint
him
but
she
carried
it
off
so
gaily
she
is
a
wonderful
girl
sweetwater
the
darling
of
all
our
hearts
saying
that
he
must
not
be
so
egotistical
as
to
think
that
the
news
of
his
illness
had
gone
beyond
derby
that
he
soon
recovered
his
spirits
and
became
a
very
promising
convalescent
that
is
all
i
know
about
the
matter
little
more
i
take
it
than
you
know
sweetwater
nodded
he
had
expected
nothing
from
the
doctor
and
was
not
disappointed
at
his
failure
there
were
two
strings
to
his
bow
and
the
one
proving
valueless
he
proceeded
to
test
the
other
you
have
mentioned
miss
scott
as
the
confidante
and
only
confidante
of
this
unhappy
pair
said
he
would
it
be
possible
can
you
make
it
possible
for
me
to
see
her
it
was
a
daring
proposition
he
understood
this
at
once
from
the
doctor
s
expression
and
fearing
a
hasty
rebuff
he
proceeded
to
supplement
his
request
with
a
few
added
arguments
urged
with
such
unexpected
address
and
show
of
reason
that
fenton
s
aspect
visibly
softened
and
in
the
end
he
found
himself
ready
to
promise
that
he
would
do
what
he
could
to
secure
his
visitor
the
interview
he
desired
if
he
would
come
to
the
house
the
next
day
at
the
time
of
his
own
morning
visit
this
was
as
much
as
the
young
detective
could
expect
and
having
expressed
his
thanks
he
took
his
leave
in
anything
but
a
discontented
frame
of
mind
with
so
powerful
an
advocate
as
the
doctor
he
felt
confident
that
he
should
soon
be
able
to
conquer
this
young
girl
s
reticence
and
learn
all
that
was
to
be
learned
from
any
one
but
brotherson
himself
in
the
time
which
must
elapse
between
that
happy
hour
and
the
present
he
would
circulate
and
learn
what
he
could
about
the
prospective
manager
but
he
soon
found
that
he
could
not
enter
the
works
without
a
permit
and
this
he
was
hardly
in
a
position
to
demand
so
he
strolled
about
the
village
instead
and
later
wandered
away
into
the
forest
struck
by
the
inviting
aspect
of
a
narrow
and
little
used
road
opening
from
the
highway
shortly
above
the
house
where
his
interests
were
just
then
centred
he
strolled
into
the
heart
of
the
spring
woods
till
he
came
to
a
depression
where
a
surprise
awaited
him
in
the
shape
of
a
peculiar
structure
rising
from
its
midst
where
it
just
fitted
or
so
nearly
fitted
that
one
could
hardly
walk
about
it
without
brushing
the
surrounding
tree
trunks
of
an
oval
shape
with
its
door
facing
the
approach
it
nestled
there
a
wonder
to
the
eye
and
the
occasion
of
considerable
speculation
to
his
inquiring
mind
it
had
not
been
long
built
as
was
shown
very
plainly
by
the
fresh
appearance
of
the
unpainted
boards
of
which
it
was
constructed
and
while
it
boasted
of
a
door
as
i
ve
already
said
there
were
no
evidences
visible
of
any
other
break
in
the
smooth
neatly
finished
walls
a
wooden
ellipse
with
a
roof
but
no
windows
such
it
appeared
and
such
it
proved
to
be
a
mystery
to
sweetwater
s
eyes
and
like
all
mysteries
interesting
for
what
purpose
had
it
been
built
and
why
this
isolation
it
was
too
flimsy
for
a
reservoir
and
too
expensive
for
the
wild
freak
of
a
crank
a
nearer
view
increased
his
curiosity
in
the
projection
of
the
roof
over
the
curving
sides
he
found
fresh
food
for
inquiry
as
he
examined
it
in
the
walk
he
made
around
the
whole
structure
he
came
to
a
place
where
something
like
a
hinge
became
visible
and
further
on
another
the
roof
was
not
simply
a
roof
it
was
also
a
lid
capable
of
being
raised
for
the
air
and
light
which
the
lack
of
windows
necessitated
this
was
an
odd
discovery
indeed
giving
to
the
uncanny
structure
the
appearance
of
a
huge
box
the
cover
of
which
could
be
raised
or
lowered
at
pleasure
and
again
he
asked
himself
for
what
it
could
be
intended
what
enterprise
even
of
the
great
works
could
demand
a
secrecy
so
absolute
that
such
pains
as
these
should
be
taken
to
shut
out
all
possibility
of
a
prying
eye
nothing
in
his
experience
supplied
him
with
an
answer
he
was
still
looking
up
at
these
hinges
with
a
glance
which
took
in
at
the
same
time
the
nearness
and
extreme
height
of
the
trees
by
which
this
sylvan
mystery
was
surrounded
when
a
sound
from
the
road
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hollow
brought
his
conjectures
to
a
standstill
and
sent
him
hurrying
on
to
the
nearest
point
from
which
that
road
became
visible
a
team
was
approaching
he
could
hear
the
heavy
tread
of
horses
working
their
laborious
way
through
trees
whose
obstructing
branches
swished
before
and
behind
them
they
were
bringing
in
a
load
for
this
shed
whose
uses
he
would
consequently
soon
understand
grateful
for
his
good
luck
for
his
was
a
curiosity
which
could
not
stand
defeat
he
took
a
few
steps
into
the
wood
and
from
the
vantage
point
of
a
concealing
cluster
of
bushes
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
spot
where
the
road
opened
into
the
hollow
something
blue
moved
there
and
in
another
moment
to
his
great
amazement
there
stepped
into
view
the
spirited
form
of
doris
scott
who
if
he
had
given
the
matter
a
thought
he
would
have
supposed
to
be
sitting
just
then
by
the
bedside
of
her
patient
a
half
mile
back
on
the
road
she
was
dressed
for
the
woods
in
a
blue
skirt
and
jacket
and
moved
like
a
leader
in
front
of
a
heavily
laden
wagon
now
coming
to
a
standstill
before
the
closely
shut
shed
if
such
we
may
call
it
i
have
a
key
so
she
called
out
to
the
driver
who
had
paused
for
orders
when
i
swing
the
doors
wide
drive
straight
sweetwater
took
a
look
at
the
wagon
it
was
piled
high
with
large
wooden
boxes
on
more
than
one
of
which
he
could
see
scrawled
the
words
brotherson
derby
pa
this
explained
her
presence
but
the
boxes
told
nothing
they
were
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
and
some
of
them
so
large
that
the
assistance
of
another
man
was
needed
to
handle
them
sweetwater
was
about
to
offer
his
services
when
a
second
man
appeared
from
somewhere
in
the
rear
and
the
detective
s
attention
being
thus
released
from
the
load
out
of
which
he
could
make
nothing
he
allowed
it
to
concentrate
upon
the
young
girl
who
had
it
in
charge
and
who
for
many
reasons
was
the
one
person
of
supreme
importance
to
him
she
had
swung
open
the
two
wide
doors
and
now
stood
waiting
for
horse
and
wagon
to
enter
with
locks
flying
free
she
wore
no
bonnet
she
presented
a
picture
of
ever
increasing
interest
to
sweetwater
truly
she
was
a
very
beautiful
girl
buoyant
healthy
and
sweet
as
unlike
as
possible
his
preconceived
notions
of
miss
challoner
s
humble
little
protegee
her
brown
hair
of
a
rich
chestnut
hue
was
in
itself
a
wonder
on
no
head
even
in
the
great
city
he
had
just
left
had
he
seen
such
abundance
held
in
such
modest
restraint
nature
had
been
partial
to
this
little
working
girl
and
given
her
the
chevelure
of
a
queen
but
this
was
nothing
no
one
saw
this
aureole
when
once
the
eye
had
rested
on
her
features
and
caught
the
full
nobility
of
their
expression
and
the
lurking
sweetness
underlying
her
every
look
she
herself
made
the
charm
and
whether
placed
high
or
placed
low
must
ever
attract
the
eye
and
afterwards
lure
the
heart
by
an
individuality
which
hardly
needed
perfect
features
in
which
to
express
itself
young
yet
but
gifted
as
girls
of
her
class
often
are
with
the
nicest
instincts
and
purest
aspirations
she
showed
the
elevation
of
her
thoughts
both
in
her
glance
and
the
poise
with
which
she
awaited
events
sweetwater
watched
her
with
admiration
as
she
superintended
the
unloading
of
the
wagon
and
the
disposal
of
the
various
boxes
on
the
floor
within
but
as
nothing
she
said
during
the
process
was
calculated
to
afford
the
least
enlightenment
in
regard
to
their
contents
he
presently
wearied
of
his
inaction
and
turned
back
towards
the
highway
comforting
himself
with
the
reflection
that
in
a
few
short
hours
he
would
have
her
to
himself
when
nothing
but
a
blunder
on
his
part
should
hinder
him
from
sounding
her
young
mind
and
getting
such
answers
to
his
questions
as
the
affair
in
which
he
was
so
deeply
interested
demanded
xxvi
sweetwater
returns
you
see
me
again
miss
scott
i
hope
that
yesterday
s
intrusion
has
not
prejudiced
you
against
i
have
no
prejudices
was
her
simple
but
firm
reply
i
am
only
hurried
and
very
anxious
the
doctor
is
with
brotherson
just
now
but
he
has
several
other
equally
sick
patients
to
visit
and
i
dare
not
keep
him
here
too
then
you
will
welcome
my
abruptness
miss
scott
here
is
a
letter
from
challoner
it
will
explain
my
position
as
you
will
see
his
only
desire
is
to
establish
the
fact
that
his
daughter
did
not
commit
suicide
she
was
all
he
had
in
the
world
and
the
thought
that
she
could
for
any
reason
take
her
own
life
is
unbearable
to
him
indeed
he
will
not
believe
she
did
so
evidence
or
no
evidence
may
i
ask
if
you
agree
with
him
you
have
seen
miss
challoner
i
believe
do
you
think
she
was
the
woman
to
plunge
a
dagger
in
her
heart
in
a
place
as
public
as
a
hotel
reception
room
no
sweetwater
i
m
a
poor
working
girl
with
very
little
education
and
almost
no
knowledge
of
the
world
and
such
ladies
as
she
but
something
tells
me
for
all
that
that
she
was
too
nice
to
do
this
i
saw
her
once
and
it
made
me
want
to
be
quiet
and
kind
and
beautiful
like
her
i
never
shall
think
she
did
anything
so
horrible
nor
will
brotherson
ever
believe
it
he
could
not
and
live
you
see
i
am
talking
to
you
as
if
you
knew
him
the
kind
of
man
he
is
and
just
how
he
feels
towards
miss
challoner
he
is
her
voice
trailed
off
and
a
look
uncommon
and
almost
elevated
illumined
her
face
i
will
not
tell
you
what
he
is
you
will
know
if
you
ever
see
if
the
favourable
opinion
of
a
whole
town
makes
a
good
fellow
he
ought
to
be
of
the
best
returned
sweetwater
with
his
most
honest
smile
i
hear
but
one
story
of
him
wherever
i
there
is
but
one
story
to
tell
she
smiled
and
her
head
drooped
softly
but
with
no
air
of
sweetwater
watched
her
for
a
moment
and
then
remarked
i
m
going
to
take
one
thing
for
granted
that
you
are
as
anxious
as
we
are
to
clear
miss
challoner
s
o
yes
o
more
than
that
that
you
are
ready
and
eager
to
help
us
your
very
looks
show
you
are
right
i
would
do
anything
to
help
you
but
what
can
a
girl
like
me
do
nothing
nothing
i
know
too
little
challoner
must
see
that
when
you
tell
him
i
m
only
the
daughter
of
a
and
a
friend
of
brotherson
supplemented
sweetwater
yes
she
smiled
he
would
want
me
to
say
so
but
that
s
his
goodness
i
don
t
deserve
the
his
friend
and
therefore
his
confidante
sweetwater
continued
he
has
talked
to
you
about
miss
challoner
he
had
to
there
was
nobody
else
to
whom
he
could
talk
and
then
i
had
seen
her
and
could
where
did
you
see
her
in
new
york
i
was
there
once
with
father
who
took
me
to
see
her
i
think
she
had
asked
brotherson
to
send
his
little
friend
to
her
hotel
if
ever
we
came
to
new
that
was
some
time
ago
we
were
there
in
and
you
have
corresponded
ever
since
with
miss
challoner
she
has
been
good
enough
to
write
and
i
have
ventured
at
times
to
answer
the
suspicion
which
might
have
come
to
some
men
found
no
harbour
in
sweetwater
s
mind
this
young
girl
was
beautiful
there
was
no
denying
that
beautiful
in
a
somewhat
startling
and
quite
unusual
way
but
there
was
nothing
in
her
bearing
nothing
in
miss
challoner
s
letters
to
indicate
that
she
had
been
a
cause
for
jealousy
in
the
new
york
lady
s
mind
he
therefore
ignored
this
possibility
pursuing
his
inquiry
along
the
direct
lines
he
had
already
laid
out
for
himself
smiling
a
little
but
in
a
very
earnest
fashion
he
pointed
to
the
letter
she
still
held
and
quietly
said
remember
that
i
m
not
speaking
for
myself
miss
scott
when
i
seem
a
little
too
persistent
and
inquiring
you
have
corresponded
with
miss
challoner
you
have
been
told
the
fact
of
her
secret
engagement
to
brotherson
and
you
have
been
witness
to
his
conduct
and
manner
for
the
whole
time
he
has
been
separated
from
her
do
you
when
you
think
of
it
carefully
recall
anything
in
the
whole
story
of
this
romance
which
would
throw
light
upon
the
cruel
tragedy
which
has
so
unexpectedly
ended
it
anything
miss
scott
straws
show
which
way
the
stream
she
was
vehement
instantly
vehement
in
her
disclaimer
i
can
answer
at
once
said
she
because
i
have
thought
of
nothing
else
for
all
these
weeks
here
all
was
well
brotherson
was
hopeful
and
happy
and
believed
in
her
happiness
and
willingness
to
wait
for
his
success
and
this
success
was
coming
so
fast
oh
how
can
we
ever
tell
him
how
can
we
ever
answer
his
questions
even
or
keep
him
satisfied
and
calm
until
he
is
strong
enough
to
hear
the
truth
i
ve
had
to
acknowledge
already
that
i
have
had
no
letter
from
her
for
weeks
she
never
wrote
to
him
directly
you
know
and
she
never
sent
him
messages
but
he
knew
that
a
letter
to
me
was
also
a
letter
to
him
and
i
can
see
that
he
is
troubled
by
this
long
silence
though
he
says
i
was
right
not
to
let
her
know
of
his
illness
and
that
i
must
continue
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
it
till
he
is
quite
well
again
and
can
write
to
her
himself
it
is
hard
to
hear
him
talk
like
this
and
not
look
sad
or
sweetwater
remembered
miss
challoner
s
last
letter
and
wished
he
had
it
here
to
give
her
in
default
of
this
he
said
perhaps
this
not
hearing
may
act
in
the
way
of
a
preparation
for
the
shock
which
must
come
to
him
sooner
or
later
let
us
hope
so
miss
her
eyes
filled
nothing
can
prepare
him
said
she
then
added
with
a
yearning
accent
i
wish
i
were
older
or
had
more
experience
i
should
not
feel
so
helpless
but
the
gratitude
i
owe
him
will
give
me
strength
when
i
need
it
most
only
i
wish
the
suffering
might
be
mine
rather
than
unconscious
of
any
she
lifted
her
eyes
startling
sweetwater
by
the
beauty
of
her
look
i
don
t
think
i
m
so
sorry
for
oswald
brotherson
he
murmured
to
himself
as
he
left
her
he
s
a
more
fortunate
man
than
he
knows
however
deeply
he
may
feel
the
loss
of
his
first
that
evening
the
disappointed
sweetwater
took
the
train
for
new
york
he
had
failed
to
advance
the
case
in
hand
one
whit
yet
the
countenance
he
showed
gryce
at
their
first
interview
was
not
a
wholly
gloomy
one
fifty
dollars
to
the
bad
was
his
first
laconic
greeting
all
i
have
learned
is
comprised
in
these
two
statements
the
second
o
is
a
fine
fellow
and
not
intentionally
the
cause
of
our
tragedy
he
does
not
even
know
about
it
he
s
down
with
the
fever
at
present
and
they
haven
t
told
him
when
he
s
better
we
may
hear
something
but
i
doubt
even
tell
me
about
sweetwater
complied
and
such
is
the
unconsciousness
with
which
we
often
encounter
the
pivotal
circumstance
upon
which
our
future
or
the
future
of
our
most
cherished
undertaking
hangs
he
omitted
from
his
story
the
sole
discovery
which
was
of
any
real
importance
in
the
unravelling
of
the
mystery
in
which
they
were
so
deeply
concerned
he
said
nothing
of
his
walk
in
the
woods
or
of
what
he
saw
there
a
meagre
haul
he
remarked
at
the
close
but
that
s
as
it
should
be
if
you
and
i
are
right
in
our
impressions
and
the
clew
to
this
mystery
lies
here
in
the
character
and
daring
of
orlando
brotherson
that
s
why
i
m
not
down
in
the
mouth
which
goes
to
show
what
a
grip
my
prejudices
have
on
as
prejudiced
as
a
exactly
by
the
way
what
news
of
the
gentleman
i
ve
just
mentioned
is
he
as
serene
in
my
absence
as
when
under
my
eye
more
so
he
looks
like
a
man
on
the
verge
of
triumph
but
i
fear
the
triumph
he
anticipates
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
affairs
all
his
time
and
thought
is
taken
up
with
his
you
discourage
me
sir
and
now
to
see
challoner
small
comfort
can
i
carry
xxvii
the
image
of
dread
in
the
comfortable
little
of
the
scott
cottage
doris
stood
looking
eagerly
from
the
window
which
gave
upon
the
road
behind
her
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
could
be
seen
through
a
partly
opened
door
a
neatly
spread
bed
with
a
hand
lying
quietly
on
the
patched
coverlet
it
was
a
strong
looking
hand
which
even
when
quiescent
conveyed
the
idea
of
purpose
and
vitality
as
doris
said
the
fingers
never
curled
up
languidly
but
always
with
the
hint
of
a
clench
several
weeks
had
passed
since
the
departure
of
sweetwater
and
the
invalid
was
fast
gaining
strength
he
would
be
up
was
doris
thinking
of
him
undoubtedly
for
her
eyes
often
flashed
his
way
but
her
main
attention
was
fixed
upon
the
road
though
no
one
was
in
sight
at
the
moment
some
one
had
passed
for
whose
return
she
looked
some
one
whom
if
she
had
been
asked
to
describe
she
would
have
called
a
tall
man
of
middle
age
of
a
cultivated
appearance
seldom
seen
in
this
small
manufacturing
town
seldom
seen
possibly
in
any
town
he
had
glanced
up
at
the
window
as
he
went
by
in
a
manner
too
marked
not
to
excite
her
curiosity
would
he
look
up
again
when
he
came
back
she
was
waiting
there
to
see
why
she
did
not
know
she
was
not
used
to
indulging
in
petty
suppositions
of
this
kind
her
life
was
too
busy
her
anxieties
too
keen
the
great
dread
looming
ever
before
her
the
dread
of
that
hour
when
she
must
speak
left
her
very
little
heart
for
anything
dissociated
with
this
coming
event
for
a
girl
of
seventeen
she
was
unusually
thoughtful
life
had
been
hard
in
this
little
cottage
since
her
mother
died
or
rather
she
had
felt
its
responsibilities
keenly
life
itself
could
not
be
hard
where
oswald
brotherson
lived
neither
to
man
nor
woman
the
cheer
of
some
natures
possesses
a
divine
faculty
if
it
can
help
no
other
way
it
does
so
by
the
aid
of
its
own
light
such
was
the
character
of
this
man
s
temperament
the
cottage
was
a
happy
place
only
she
never
fathomed
the
depths
of
that
only
if
in
these
days
she
essayed
at
times
to
do
so
she
gave
full
credit
to
the
dread
which
rose
ever
before
her
rose
like
a
ghost
she
doris
led
by
inscrutable
fate
was
waiting
to
hurt
him
who
hurt
nobody
whose
mere
presence
was
a
blessing
but
her
interest
had
been
caught
caught
by
this
stranger
and
when
during
her
eager
watch
the
small
messenger
from
the
works
came
to
the
door
with
the
usual
daily
supply
of
books
and
magazines
for
the
patient
she
stepped
out
on
the
porch
to
speak
to
him
and
to
point
out
the
gentleman
who
was
now
rapidly
returning
from
his
stroll
up
the
road
who
is
that
johnny
she
asked
you
know
everybody
who
comes
to
town
what
is
the
name
of
the
gentleman
you
see
coming
the
boy
looked
searched
his
memory
not
without
some
show
of
misgiving
a
queer
name
he
admitted
at
last
i
never
heard
the
likes
of
it
here
before
shally
something
shally
shally
challoner
yes
that
s
it
how
could
you
guess
he
s
from
new
york
nobody
knows
why
he
s
here
don
t
seem
to
have
no
well
never
mind
run
on
johnny
and
don
t
forget
to
come
earlier
brotherson
gets
tired
does
he
i
ll
come
quick
then
quick
as
i
can
and
he
sped
off
at
a
pace
which
promised
well
for
the
morrow
challoner
there
was
but
one
challoner
in
the
world
for
doris
scott
edith
s
father
was
this
he
it
must
be
or
why
this
haunting
sense
of
something
half
remembered
as
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
face
edith
s
father
and
he
was
approaching
approaching
rapidly
on
his
way
back
to
town
would
he
stop
this
time
as
the
possibility
struck
her
she
trembled
and
drew
back
entering
the
house
but
pausing
in
the
hall
with
her
ear
turned
to
the
road
she
had
not
closed
the
door
something
within
a
hope
or
a
dread
had
prevented
that
would
he
take
it
as
an
invitation
to
come
in
no
no
she
was
not
ready
for
such
an
encounter
yet
he
might
speak
edith
s
name
oswald
might
hear
and
with
a
gasp
she
recognised
the
closeness
of
his
step
heard
it
lag
almost
halt
just
where
the
path
to
the
house
ran
into
the
roadside
but
it
passed
on
he
was
not
going
to
force
an
interview
yet
she
could
hear
him
retreating
further
and
further
away
the
event
was
not
for
this
day
thank
god
she
would
have
one
night
at
least
in
which
to
prepare
herself
with
a
sense
of
relief
so
great
that
she
realised
for
one
shocked
moment
the
full
extent
of
her
fears
she
hastened
back
into
the
with
her
collection
of
books
and
pamphlets
a
low
voice
greeted
her
it
came
from
the
adjoining
room
doris
come
here
sweet
child
i
want
how
she
would
have
bounded
joyously
at
the
summons
had
not
that
dread
raised
its
bony
finger
in
every
call
from
that
dearly
loved
voice
as
it
was
her
feet
moved
slowly
lingering
at
the
sound
but
they
carried
her
to
his
side
at
last
and
once
there
she
smiled
see
what
an
armful
she
cried
in
joyous
greeting
as
she
held
out
the
bundle
she
had
brought
you
will
be
amused
all
day
only
do
not
tire
i
do
not
want
the
papers
doris
not
yet
there
s
something
else
which
must
come
first
doris
i
have
decided
to
let
you
write
to
her
i
m
so
much
better
now
she
will
not
feel
alarmed
i
must
must
get
a
word
from
her
i
m
starving
for
it
i
lie
here
and
can
think
of
nothing
else
a
message
one
little
message
of
six
short
words
would
set
me
on
my
feet
again
so
get
your
paper
and
pen
dear
child
and
write
her
one
of
your
prettiest
had
he
loved
her
he
would
have
perceived
the
chill
which
shook
her
whole
body
as
he
spoke
but
his
first
thought
his
penetrating
thought
was
not
for
her
and
he
saw
only
the
answering
glance
the
patient
smile
she
had
not
expected
him
to
see
more
she
knew
that
she
was
quite
safe
from
the
divining
look
otherwise
he
would
have
known
her
secret
long
ago
i
m
ready
said
she
but
she
did
not
lay
down
her
bundle
she
was
not
ready
for
her
task
poor
child
she
quailed
before
it
she
quailed
so
much
that
she
feared
to
stir
lest
he
should
see
that
she
had
no
command
over
her
movements
the
man
who
watched
without
seeing
wondered
that
she
stood
so
still
and
spoke
so
briefly
but
only
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
understood
her
hesitation
and
a
look
of
great
earnestness
replaced
his
former
one
of
grave
decision
i
know
that
in
doing
this
i
am
going
beyond
my
sacred
compact
with
miss
challoner
he
said
i
never
thought
of
illness
at
least
of
illness
on
my
part
i
never
dreamt
that
i
always
so
well
always
so
full
of
life
could
know
such
feebleness
as
this
feebleness
which
is
all
of
the
body
doris
leaving
the
mind
free
to
dream
and
long
talk
of
her
child
tell
me
all
over
again
just
how
she
looked
and
spoke
that
day
you
saw
her
in
new
would
it
not
be
better
for
me
to
write
my
letter
first
papa
will
be
coming
soon
and
truda
can
never
cook
your
bird
as
you
like
surprised
now
by
something
not
quite
natural
in
her
manner
he
caught
at
her
hand
and
held
her
as
she
was
moving
away
you
are
tired
said
he
i
ve
wearied
you
with
my
commission
and
complaints
forgive
me
dear
child
and
you
are
mistaken
she
interrupted
softly
i
am
not
tired
i
only
wished
to
do
the
important
thing
first
shall
i
get
my
desk
do
you
really
wish
me
to
write
yes
said
he
softly
dropping
her
hand
i
wish
you
to
write
it
will
ensure
me
good
sleep
and
sleep
will
make
me
strong
a
few
words
doris
just
a
few
she
nodded
turning
quickly
away
to
hide
her
tears
his
smile
had
gone
to
her
very
soul
it
was
always
a
beautiful
one
his
chief
personal
attraction
but
at
this
moment
it
seemed
to
concentrate
within
it
the
unspoken
fervours
and
the
boundless
expectations
of
a
great
love
and
she
who
was
the
aim
and
cause
of
all
this
sweetness
lay
in
unresponsive
silence
in
a
distant
tomb
but
doris
own
smile
was
not
lacking
in
encouragement
and
beauty
when
she
came
back
a
few
minutes
later
and
sat
down
by
his
side
to
write
his
melted
before
it
leaving
his
eyes
very
earnest
as
he
watched
her
bending
figure
and
the
little
hand
at
its
unaccustomed
task
i
must
give
her
daily
exercises
he
decided
within
himself
that
look
of
pain
shows
how
difficult
this
work
is
for
her
it
must
be
made
easy
at
any
cost
to
my
time
such
beauty
calls
for
accomplishment
i
must
not
neglect
so
plain
a
meantime
she
was
struggling
to
find
words
in
face
of
that
great
dread
she
had
written
dear
miss
challoner
and
was
staring
in
horror
at
the
soulless
words
only
her
sense
of
duty
upheld
her
gladly
would
she
have
torn
the
sheet
in
two
and
rushed
away
how
could
she
add
sentences
to
this
hollow
phrase
the
mere
employment
of
which
seemed
a
sacrilege
dear
miss
challoner
oh
she
was
dear
but
unconsciously
the
young
head
drooped
and
the
pen
slid
from
her
hand
i
can
not
she
murmured
i
can
not
think
what
to
shall
i
help
you
came
softly
from
the
bed
i
ll
try
and
not
forget
that
it
is
doris
if
you
will
be
so
good
she
answered
with
renewed
courage
i
can
put
the
words
down
if
you
will
only
find
them
for
write
then
dear
miss
challoner
i
have
already
written
why
do
you
shudder
i
m
cold
i
ve
been
cold
all
day
but
never
mind
that
brotherson
tell
me
how
to
begin
my
this
way
i
ve
not
been
able
to
answer
your
kind
letter
because
i
have
had
to
play
nurse
for
some
three
or
four
weeks
to
a
very
fretful
and
exacting
have
you
written
that
no
said
doris
bending
over
her
desk
till
her
curls
fell
in
a
tangle
over
her
white
cheeks
i
do
not
like
to
she
protested
at
last
with
an
attempt
at
naivete
which
seemed
real
enough
to
him
well
leave
out
the
fretful
if
you
must
but
keep
in
the
exacting
i
have
been
exacting
you
silence
broken
only
by
the
scratching
of
the
stubborn
pen
it
s
down
she
whispered
she
said
afterward
that
it
was
like
writing
with
a
ghost
looking
over
one
s
shoulder
then
add
mr
brotherson
has
had
a
slight
attack
of
fever
but
he
is
getting
well
fast
and
will
soon
do
i
run
on
too
quickly
no
no
i
can
but
not
without
losing
breath
eh
doris
as
he
laughed
she
smiled
there
was
a
heroism
in
that
smile
oswald
brotherson
of
which
you
knew
nothing
you
might
speak
a
little
more
slowly
she
admitted
quietly
he
repeated
the
last
phrase
but
he
is
getting
well
fast
and
will
soon
be
ready
to
take
up
the
management
of
the
works
which
was
given
him
just
before
he
was
taken
that
will
show
her
that
i
am
working
up
he
brightly
remarked
as
doris
carefully
penned
the
last
word
of
myself
you
need
say
nothing
more
unless
he
paused
and
his
face
took
on
a
wistful
look
which
doris
dared
not
meet
unless
but
no
no
she
must
think
it
has
been
only
a
passing
indisposition
if
she
knew
i
had
been
really
ill
she
would
suffer
and
perhaps
act
imprudently
or
suffer
and
not
dare
to
act
at
all
which
might
be
sadder
for
her
still
leave
it
where
it
is
and
begin
about
yourself
write
a
good
deal
about
yourself
so
that
she
will
see
that
you
are
not
worried
and
that
all
is
well
with
us
here
can
not
you
do
that
without
assistance
surely
you
can
tell
her
about
that
last
piece
of
embroidery
you
showed
me
she
will
be
glad
to
hear
why
doris
oh
brotherson
the
poor
child
burst
out
you
must
let
me
cry
i
m
so
glad
to
see
you
better
and
interested
in
all
sorts
of
things
these
are
not
tears
of
grief
i
i
but
i
m
forgetting
what
the
doctor
told
me
you
are
growing
excited
and
i
was
to
see
that
you
were
calm
always
calm
i
will
take
my
desk
away
i
will
write
the
rest
in
the
other
room
while
you
look
at
the
but
bring
your
letter
back
for
me
to
seal
i
want
to
see
it
in
its
envelope
oh
doris
you
are
a
good
little
girl
she
shook
her
head
and
hastened
to
hide
herself
from
him
in
the
other
room
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
came
back
with
the
letter
folded
and
in
its
envelope
when
she
did
her
face
was
composed
and
her
manner
natural
she
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
what
her
duty
was
and
how
she
was
going
to
perform
it
here
is
the
letter
said
she
laying
it
in
his
outstretched
hand
then
she
turned
her
back
she
knew
with
a
woman
s
unerring
instinct
why
he
wished
to
handle
it
before
it
went
she
felt
that
kiss
he
folded
away
in
it
in
every
fibre
of
her
aroused
and
sympathetic
heart
but
the
hardest
part
of
the
ordeal
was
over
and
her
eyes
beamed
softly
when
she
turned
again
to
take
it
from
his
hand
and
affix
the
stamp
you
will
mail
it
yourself
he
asked
i
should
like
to
have
you
put
it
into
the
box
with
your
own
i
will
put
it
in
after
supper
she
promised
him
his
smile
of
contentment
assured
her
that
this
trial
of
her
courage
and
was
not
without
one
blessed
result
he
would
rest
for
several
days
in
the
pleasure
of
what
he
had
done
or
thought
he
had
done
she
need
not
cringe
before
that
image
of
dread
for
two
three
days
at
least
meanwhile
he
would
grow
strong
in
body
and
she
perhaps
in
spirit
only
one
precaution
she
must
take
no
hint
of
challoner
s
presence
in
town
must
reach
him
he
must
be
guarded
from
a
knowledge
of
that
fact
as
certainly
as
from
the
more
serious
one
which
lay
behind
it
xxviii
i
hope
never
to
see
that
man
that
this
would
be
a
difficult
thing
to
do
doris
was
soon
to
realise
challoner
continued
to
pass
the
house
twice
a
day
and
the
time
finally
came
when
he
ventured
up
the
walk
doris
was
in
the
window
and
saw
him
coming
she
slipped
softly
out
and
intercepted
him
before
he
had
stepped
upon
the
porch
she
had
caught
up
her
hat
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
and
was
fitting
it
to
her
head
as
he
looked
up
and
saw
her
miss
scott
he
asked
yes
you
know
me
he
went
on
one
foot
on
the
step
and
one
still
on
the
walk
before
replying
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
then
as
she
noted
his
surprise
she
carefully
explained
mr
brotherson
our
boarder
is
just
recovering
from
typhoid
he
is
still
weak
and
acutely
susceptible
to
the
least
noise
i
was
afraid
that
our
voices
might
disturb
him
do
you
mind
walking
a
little
way
up
the
road
that
is
if
your
visit
was
intended
for
her
flush
the
beauty
which
must
have
struck
even
him
but
more
than
all
else
her
youth
seemed
to
reconcile
him
to
this
unconventional
request
bowing
he
took
his
foot
from
the
step
saying
as
she
joined
him
yes
you
are
the
one
i
wanted
to
see
that
is
later
i
hope
to
have
the
privilege
of
a
conversation
with
she
gave
him
one
quick
look
trembling
so
that
he
offered
her
his
arm
with
a
fatherly
air
i
see
that
you
understand
my
errand
here
he
proceeded
with
a
grave
smile
meant
as
she
knew
for
her
encouragement
i
am
glad
because
we
can
go
at
once
to
the
point
miss
scott
he
continued
in
a
voice
from
which
he
no
longer
strove
to
keep
back
the
evidences
of
deep
feeling
i
have
the
strongest
interest
in
your
patient
that
one
man
can
have
in
another
where
there
is
no
personal
acquaintanceship
you
who
have
every
reason
to
understand
my
reasons
for
this
will
accept
the
statement
i
hope
as
frankly
as
it
is
she
nodded
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
but
she
did
not
hesitate
to
raise
them
she
had
the
greatest
desire
to
see
the
face
of
the
man
who
could
speak
like
this
and
yet
of
whose
pride
and
sense
of
superiority
his
daughter
had
stood
in
such
awe
that
she
had
laid
a
seal
upon
the
impulses
of
her
heart
and
imposed
such
tasks
and
weary
waiting
upon
her
lover
doris
forgot
in
meeting
his
softened
glance
and
tender
almost
wistful
expression
the
changes
which
can
be
made
by
a
great
grief
and
only
wondered
why
her
sweet
benefactress
had
not
taken
him
into
her
confidence
and
thus
possibly
averted
the
doom
which
doris
felt
had
in
some
way
grown
out
of
this
secrecy
why
should
she
have
feared
the
disapproval
of
this
man
she
inwardly
queried
as
she
cast
him
a
confiding
look
which
pleased
him
greatly
as
his
tone
now
showed
when
i
lost
my
daughter
i
lost
everything
he
declared
as
they
walked
slowly
up
the
road
nothing
excites
my
interest
save
that
which
once
excited
hers
i
am
told
that
the
deepest
interest
of
her
life
lay
here
i
am
also
told
that
it
was
an
interest
quite
worthy
of
her
i
expect
to
find
it
so
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
to
find
it
so
and
that
is
why
i
have
come
to
this
town
and
expect
to
linger
till
brotherson
has
recovered
sufficiently
to
see
me
i
hope
that
this
will
be
agreeable
to
him
i
hope
that
i
am
not
presuming
too
much
in
cherishing
these
doris
turned
her
candid
eyes
upon
him
i
can
not
tell
i
do
not
know
said
she
nobody
knows
not
even
the
doctor
what
effect
the
news
we
so
dread
to
give
him
will
have
upon
brotherson
you
will
have
to
wait
we
all
shall
have
to
wait
the
results
of
that
revelation
it
can
not
be
kept
from
him
much
longer
when
i
return
i
shall
shrink
from
his
first
look
in
the
fear
of
seeing
it
betray
this
dreadful
knowledge
yet
i
have
a
faithful
woman
there
to
keep
every
one
out
of
his
you
have
had
much
to
carry
for
one
so
young
was
challoner
s
sympathetic
remark
you
must
let
me
help
you
when
that
awful
moment
comes
i
am
at
the
hotel
and
shall
stay
there
till
brotherson
is
pronounced
quite
well
i
have
no
other
duty
now
in
life
but
to
sustain
him
through
his
trouble
and
then
with
what
aid
he
can
give
search
out
and
find
the
cause
of
my
daughter
s
death
which
i
will
never
admit
without
the
fullest
proof
to
have
been
one
of
doris
trembled
it
was
not
suicide
she
declared
vehemently
i
have
always
felt
sure
that
it
was
not
but
i
her
hand
fell
clenched
on
her
breast
and
her
eyes
gleamed
strangely
challoner
was
himself
greatly
startled
what
had
happened
what
could
have
happened
since
yesterday
that
she
should
emphasise
that
now
i
ve
not
told
any
one
she
went
on
as
he
stopped
short
in
the
road
in
his
anxiety
to
understand
her
but
i
will
tell
you
only
not
here
not
with
all
these
people
driving
past
most
of
whom
know
me
come
to
the
house
later
this
evening
after
brotherson
s
room
is
closed
for
the
night
i
have
a
little
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
where
we
can
talk
without
being
heard
would
you
object
to
doing
that
am
i
asking
too
much
of
you
no
not
at
all
he
assured
her
expect
me
at
eight
will
that
be
too
early
no
no
oh
how
those
people
stared
let
us
hasten
back
or
they
may
connect
your
name
with
what
we
want
kept
he
smiled
at
her
fears
but
gave
in
to
her
humour
he
would
see
her
soon
again
and
possibly
learn
something
which
would
amply
repay
him
both
for
his
trouble
and
his
patience
but
when
evening
came
and
she
turned
to
face
him
in
that
little
where
he
had
quietly
followed
her
he
was
conscious
of
a
change
in
her
manner
which
forbade
these
high
hopes
the
gleam
was
gone
from
her
eyes
the
tremulous
eagerness
from
her
mobile
and
sensitive
mouth
she
had
been
thinking
in
the
hours
which
had
passed
and
had
lost
the
confidence
of
that
one
impetuous
moment
her
greeting
betrayed
embarrassment
and
she
hesitated
painfully
before
she
spoke
i
don
t
know
what
you
will
think
of
me
she
ventured
at
last
motioning
to
a
chair
but
not
sitting
herself
you
have
had
time
to
think
over
what
i
said
and
probably
expect
something
real
something
you
could
tell
people
but
it
isn
t
like
that
it
s
a
feeling
a
belief
i
m
so
sure
sure
of
what
miss
scott
she
gave
a
glance
at
the
door
before
stepping
up
nearer
he
had
not
taken
the
chair
she
preferred
sure
that
i
have
seen
the
face
of
the
man
who
murdered
her
it
was
in
a
dream
she
whisperingly
completed
her
great
eyes
misty
with
awe
a
dream
miss
scott
he
tried
to
hide
his
disappointment
yes
i
knew
that
it
would
sound
foolish
to
you
it
sounds
foolish
to
me
but
listen
sir
listen
to
what
i
have
to
tell
and
then
you
can
judge
i
was
very
much
agitated
yesterday
i
had
to
write
a
letter
at
brotherson
s
dictation
a
letter
to
her
you
can
understand
my
horror
and
the
effort
i
made
to
hide
my
emotion
i
was
quite
unnerved
i
could
not
sleep
till
morning
and
then
and
then
i
saw
i
hope
i
can
describe
grasping
at
a
chair
she
leaned
on
it
for
support
closing
her
eyes
to
all
but
that
inner
vision
a
breathless
moment
followed
then
she
murmured
in
strained
monotonous
tones
i
see
it
again
just
as
i
saw
it
in
the
early
morning
but
even
more
plainly
if
that
is
possible
a
hall
i
should
call
it
a
hall
though
i
don
t
remember
seeing
any
place
like
it
before
with
a
little
staircase
at
the
side
up
which
there
comes
a
man
who
stops
just
at
the
top
and
looks
intently
my
way
there
is
fierceness
in
his
face
a
look
which
means
no
good
to
anybody
and
as
his
hand
goes
to
his
overcoat
pocket
drawing
out
something
which
i
can
not
describe
but
which
he
handles
as
if
it
were
a
pistol
i
feel
a
horrible
fear
and
and
the
child
was
staggering
and
the
hand
which
was
free
had
sought
her
heart
where
it
lay
clenched
the
knuckles
showing
white
in
the
dim
light
challoner
watched
her
with
dilated
eyes
the
spell
under
which
she
spoke
falling
in
some
degree
upon
him
had
she
finished
was
this
all
no
she
is
speaking
again
but
very
low
almost
in
a
whisper
there
is
music
a
crash
but
i
plainly
see
his
other
hand
approach
the
object
he
is
holding
he
takes
something
from
the
end
the
object
is
pointed
my
way
i
am
looking
into
into
what
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
even
see
him
now
the
space
where
he
stood
is
empty
everything
fades
and
i
wake
with
a
loud
cry
in
my
ears
and
a
sense
of
death
she
had
lifted
her
hand
and
struck
at
her
heart
opening
her
eyes
as
she
did
so
yet
it
was
not
i
who
had
been
shot
she
added
softly
challoner
shuddered
this
was
like
the
reopening
of
his
daughter
s
grave
but
he
had
entered
upon
the
scene
with
a
full
appreciation
of
the
ordeal
awaiting
him
and
he
did
not
lose
his
calmness
or
the
control
of
his
judgment
be
seated
miss
scott
he
entreated
taking
a
chair
himself
you
have
described
the
spot
and
some
of
the
circumstances
of
my
daughter
s
death
as
accurately
as
if
you
had
been
there
but
you
have
doubtless
read
a
full
account
of
those
details
in
the
papers
possibly
seen
pictures
which
would
make
the
place
quite
real
to
you
the
mind
is
a
strange
storehouse
we
do
not
always
know
what
lies
hidden
within
that
s
true
she
admitted
but
the
man
i
had
never
seen
the
man
or
any
picture
of
him
and
his
face
was
clearest
of
all
i
should
know
it
if
i
saw
it
anywhere
it
is
imprinted
on
my
memory
as
plainly
as
yours
oh
i
hope
never
to
see
that
man
challoner
sighed
he
had
really
anticipated
something
from
the
interview
the
disappointment
was
keen
a
moment
of
expectation
the
thrill
which
comes
to
us
all
under
the
shadow
of
the
supernatural
and
then
this
a
young
and
imaginative
girl
s
dream
convincing
to
herself
but
supplying
nothing
which
had
not
already
been
supplied
both
by
the
facts
and
his
own
imagination
a
man
had
stood
at
the
staircase
and
this
man
had
raised
his
arm
she
said
that
she
had
seen
something
like
a
pistol
in
his
hand
but
his
daughter
had
not
been
shot
this
he
thought
it
well
to
point
out
to
her
leaning
toward
her
that
he
might
get
her
full
attention
he
waited
till
her
eyes
met
his
then
quietly
asked
have
you
ever
named
this
man
to
yourself
she
started
and
dropped
her
eyes
i
do
not
dare
to
said
she
why
because
i
ve
read
in
the
papers
that
the
man
who
stood
there
had
the
same
name
as
tell
me
miss
as
brotherson
s
but
you
do
not
think
it
was
his
brother
i
do
not
you
ve
never
seen
his
brother
nor
his
picture
no
brotherson
has
aren
t
they
friends
does
he
never
mention
orlando
very
very
rarely
but
i
ve
no
reason
to
think
they
are
not
on
good
terms
i
know
they
miss
scott
yes
you
must
not
rely
too
much
upon
your
her
eyes
flashed
to
his
and
then
fell
again
dreams
are
not
revelations
they
are
the
reproduction
of
what
already
lies
hidden
in
the
mind
i
can
prove
that
your
dream
is
how
she
looked
startled
you
speak
of
seeing
something
being
leveled
at
you
which
made
you
think
of
a
yes
i
was
looking
directly
into
but
my
daughter
was
not
shot
she
died
from
a
doris
lovely
face
with
its
tender
lines
and
girlish
curves
took
on
a
strange
look
of
conviction
which
deepened
rather
than
melted
under
his
indulgent
but
penetrating
gaze
i
know
that
you
think
so
but
my
dream
says
no
i
saw
this
object
it
was
pointed
directly
towards
me
above
all
i
saw
his
face
it
was
the
face
of
one
whose
finger
is
on
the
trigger
and
who
means
death
and
i
believe
my
well
it
was
useless
to
reason
further
gentle
in
all
else
she
was
immovable
so
far
as
this
idea
was
concerned
and
seeing
this
he
let
the
matter
go
and
prepared
to
take
his
leave
she
seemed
to
be
quite
ready
for
this
anxiety
about
her
patient
had
regained
its
place
in
her
mind
and
her
glance
sped
constantly
toward
the
door
taking
her
hand
in
his
he
said
some
kind
words
then
crossed
to
the
door
and
opened
it
instantly
her
finger
flew
to
her
lips
and
obedient
to
its
silent
injunction
he
took
up
his
hat
in
silence
and
was
proceeding
down
the
hall
when
the
bell
rang
startling
them
both
and
causing
him
to
step
quickly
back
who
is
it
she
asked
father
s
in
and
visitors
seldom
come
so
shall
i
see
she
nodded
looking
strangely
troubled
as
the
door
swung
open
revealing
the
tall
strong
figure
of
a
man
facing
them
from
the
porch
a
stranger
formed
itself
upon
her
lips
and
she
was
moving
forward
when
the
man
suddenly
stepped
into
the
glare
of
the
light
and
she
stopped
with
a
murmur
of
dismay
which
pierced
challoner
s
heart
and
prepared
him
for
the
words
which
now
fell
shudderingly
from
her
lips
it
is
he
it
is
he
i
said
that
i
should
know
him
wherever
i
saw
then
with
a
quiet
turn
towards
the
intruder
oh
why
why
did
you
come
here
xxix
do
you
know
my
brother
her
hands
were
thrust
out
to
repel
her
features
were
fixed
her
beauty
something
wonderful
orlando
brotherson
thus
met
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
vision
before
him
then
slowly
and
with
effort
withdrawing
his
gaze
he
sought
the
face
of
challoner
with
the
first
sign
of
open
disturbance
that
gentleman
had
ever
seen
in
him
ah
said
he
my
welcome
is
readily
understood
i
see
you
far
from
home
and
with
an
ironical
bow
he
turned
again
to
doris
who
had
dropped
her
hands
but
in
whose
cheeks
the
pallor
still
lingered
in
a
way
to
check
the
easy
flow
of
words
with
which
he
might
have
sought
to
carry
off
the
situation
am
i
in
oswald
brotherson
s
house
he
asked
i
was
directed
here
but
possibly
there
may
be
some
it
is
here
he
lives
said
she
moving
back
automatically
till
she
stood
again
by
the
threshold
of
the
small
room
in
which
she
had
received
challoner
do
you
wish
to
see
him
if
so
i
fear
it
is
impossible
he
has
been
very
ill
and
is
not
allowed
to
receive
visits
from
i
am
not
a
stranger
announced
the
newcomer
with
a
smile
few
could
see
unmoved
it
offered
such
a
contrast
to
his
stern
and
dominating
figure
i
thought
i
heard
some
words
of
recognition
which
would
prove
your
knowledge
of
that
she
did
not
answer
her
lips
had
parted
but
her
thought
or
at
least
the
expression
of
her
thought
hung
suspended
in
the
terror
of
this
meeting
for
which
she
was
not
at
all
prepared
he
seemed
to
note
this
terror
whether
or
not
he
understood
its
cause
and
smiled
again
as
he
added
mr
brotherson
must
have
spoken
of
his
brother
orlando
i
am
he
miss
scott
will
you
let
me
come
in
now
her
eyes
sought
those
of
challoner
who
quietly
nodded
immediately
she
stepped
from
before
the
door
which
her
figure
had
guarded
and
motioning
him
to
enter
she
begged
challoner
with
an
imploring
look
to
sustain
her
in
the
interview
she
saw
before
her
he
had
no
desire
for
this
encounter
especially
as
brotherson
s
glance
in
his
direction
had
been
anything
but
conciliatory
he
was
quite
convinced
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
it
but
he
could
not
resist
her
appeal
and
followed
them
into
the
little
room
whose
limited
dimensions
made
the
tall
orlando
look
bigger
and
stronger
and
more
lordly
in
his
than
ever
i
am
sorry
it
is
so
late
she
began
contemplating
his
intrusive
figure
with
forced
composure
we
have
to
be
very
quiet
in
the
evenings
so
as
not
to
disturb
your
brother
s
first
sleep
which
is
of
great
importance
to
then
i
m
not
to
see
him
i
pray
you
to
wait
he
s
he
s
been
a
very
sick
dangerously
so
orlando
continued
to
regard
her
with
a
peculiar
awakening
gaze
showing
challoner
thought
more
interest
in
her
than
in
his
brother
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
mechanically
and
as
if
in
sole
obedience
to
the
proprieties
of
the
occasion
i
did
not
know
he
was
ill
till
very
lately
his
last
letter
was
a
cheerful
one
and
i
supposed
that
all
was
right
till
chance
revealed
the
truth
i
came
on
at
once
i
was
intending
to
come
anyway
i
have
business
here
as
you
probably
know
miss
she
shook
her
head
i
know
very
little
about
business
said
she
my
brother
has
not
told
you
why
he
expected
me
he
has
not
even
told
me
that
he
expected
no
the
word
was
highly
expressive
there
was
surprise
in
it
and
a
touch
of
wonder
but
more
than
all
satisfaction
oswald
was
always
he
declared
it
s
a
good
fault
i
m
obliged
to
the
these
last
words
were
uttered
with
a
lightness
which
imposed
upon
his
two
highly
agitated
hearers
causing
challoner
to
frown
and
doris
to
shrink
back
in
indignation
at
the
man
who
could
indulge
in
a
sportive
suggestion
in
presence
of
such
fears
if
not
of
such
memories
as
the
situation
evoked
but
to
one
who
knew
the
strong
and
man
to
sweetwater
possibly
had
he
been
present
there
was
in
this
very
attempt
in
his
quiet
manner
and
in
the
strange
and
fitful
flash
of
his
ordinarily
quick
eye
that
which
showed
he
was
labouring
and
had
been
labouring
almost
from
his
first
entrance
under
an
excitement
of
thought
and
feeling
which
in
one
of
his
powerfully
organised
nature
must
end
and
that
soon
in
an
outburst
of
mysterious
passion
which
would
carry
everything
before
it
but
he
did
not
mean
that
it
should
happen
here
he
was
too
accustomed
to
to
forget
himself
in
this
presence
he
would
hold
these
rampant
dogs
in
leash
till
the
hour
of
solitude
then
a
glittering
smile
twisted
his
lips
as
he
continued
to
gaze
first
at
the
girl
who
had
just
entered
his
life
and
then
at
the
man
he
had
every
reason
to
distrust
and
with
that
firm
restraint
upon
himself
still
in
full
force
remarked
with
a
courteous
inclination
the
hour
is
late
for
further
conversation
i
have
a
room
at
the
hotel
and
will
return
to
it
at
once
in
the
morning
i
hope
to
see
my
he
was
going
doris
not
knowing
what
to
say
challoner
not
desirous
of
detaining
him
when
there
came
the
sound
of
a
little
tinkle
from
the
other
side
of
the
hall
blanching
the
young
girl
s
cheeks
and
causing
orlando
brotherson
s
brows
to
rise
in
peculiar
satisfaction
my
brother
he
asked
yes
came
in
faltering
reply
he
has
heard
our
voices
i
must
go
to
say
that
orlando
wishes
him
a
good
night
smiled
her
heart
s
enemy
with
a
bow
of
infinite
grace
she
shuddered
and
was
hastening
from
the
room
when
her
glance
fell
on
challoner
he
was
pale
and
looked
greatly
disturbed
the
prospect
of
being
left
alone
with
a
man
whom
she
had
herself
denounced
to
him
as
his
daughter
s
murderer
might
prove
a
tax
to
his
strength
to
which
she
had
no
right
to
subject
him
pausing
with
an
appealing
air
she
made
him
a
slight
gesture
which
he
at
once
understood
i
will
accompany
you
into
the
hall
said
he
then
if
anything
is
wrong
you
have
but
to
speak
my
but
orlando
brotherson
displeased
by
this
move
took
a
step
which
brought
him
between
the
two
you
can
hear
her
from
here
if
she
chooses
to
speak
there
s
a
point
to
be
settled
between
us
before
either
of
us
leaves
this
house
and
this
opportunity
is
as
good
as
another
go
to
my
brother
miss
scott
we
will
await
your
a
flash
from
the
proud
banker
s
eye
but
no
demur
rather
a
gesture
of
consent
doris
with
a
look
of
deep
anxiety
sped
away
and
the
two
men
stood
face
to
face
it
was
one
of
those
moments
which
men
recognise
as
memorable
what
had
the
one
to
say
or
the
other
to
hear
worthy
of
this
preamble
and
the
more
than
doubtful
relation
in
which
they
stood
each
to
each
challoner
had
more
time
than
he
expected
in
which
to
wonder
and
gird
himself
for
whatever
suffering
or
shock
awaited
him
for
orlando
brotherson
unlike
his
usual
self
kept
him
waiting
while
he
collected
his
own
wits
which
strange
to
say
seemed
to
have
vanished
with
the
girl
but
the
question
finally
came
mr
challoner
do
you
know
my
brother
i
have
never
seen
do
you
know
him
does
he
know
you
not
at
all
we
are
it
was
said
honestly
they
did
not
know
each
other
challoner
was
quite
correct
in
his
statement
but
the
other
had
his
doubts
why
shouldn
t
he
have
the
coincidence
of
finding
this
mourner
if
not
avenger
of
edith
challoner
in
his
own
direct
radius
again
at
a
spot
so
distant
so
obscure
and
so
disconnected
with
any
apparent
business
reason
was
certainly
startling
enough
unless
the
tie
could
be
found
in
his
brother
s
name
and
close
relationship
to
himself
he
therefore
allowed
himself
to
press
the
question
men
sometimes
correspond
who
do
not
know
each
other
you
knew
that
a
brotherson
lived
here
and
hoped
to
learn
something
about
me
no
my
interest
was
solely
with
your
with
my
brother
with
oswald
what
interest
can
you
have
in
him
apart
from
me
oswald
is
suddenly
a
thought
came
an
unimaginable
one
one
with
power
to
blanch
even
his
hardy
cheek
and
shake
a
soul
unassailable
by
all
small
emotions
oswald
brotherson
he
repeated
adding
in
unintelligible
tones
to
himself
o
b
the
same
initials
they
are
following
up
these
initials
poor
then
aloud
it
hardly
becomes
me
perhaps
to
question
your
motives
in
this
attempt
at
making
my
brother
s
acquaintance
i
think
i
can
guess
them
but
your
labour
will
be
wasted
oswald
s
interests
do
not
extend
beyond
this
town
they
hardly
extend
to
me
we
are
strangers
almost
you
will
learn
nothing
from
him
on
the
subject
which
naturally
engrosses
challoner
simply
bowed
i
do
not
feel
called
upon
said
he
to
explain
my
reasons
for
wishing
to
know
your
brother
i
will
simply
satisfy
you
upon
a
point
which
may
well
rouse
your
curiosity
you
remember
that
that
my
daughter
s
last
act
was
the
writing
of
a
letter
to
a
little
protegee
of
hers
miss
scott
was
that
protegee
in
seeking
her
i
came
upon
him
do
you
require
me
to
say
more
on
this
subject
wait
till
i
have
seen
oswald
brotherson
and
then
perhaps
i
can
do
receiving
no
answer
to
this
challoner
turned
again
to
the
man
who
was
the
object
of
his
deepest
suspicions
to
find
him
still
in
the
daze
of
that
unimaginable
thought
battling
with
it
scoffing
at
it
succumbing
to
it
and
all
without
a
word
challoner
was
without
clew
to
this
struggle
but
the
might
of
it
and
the
mystery
of
it
drove
him
in
extreme
agitation
from
the
room
though
proof
was
lacking
though
proof
might
never
come
nothing
could
ever
alter
his
belief
from
this
moment
on
that
doris
was
right
in
her
estimate
of
this
man
s
guilt
however
unsubstantial
her
reasoning
might
appear
how
far
he
might
have
been
carried
by
this
new
conviction
whether
he
would
have
left
the
house
without
seeing
doris
again
or
exchanging
another
word
with
the
man
whose
very
presence
stifled
him
he
had
no
opportunity
to
show
for
before
he
had
taken
another
step
he
encountered
the
hurrying
figure
of
doris
who
was
returning
to
her
guests
with
an
air
of
marked
relief
he
does
not
know
that
you
are
here
she
whispered
to
challoner
as
she
passed
him
then
as
she
again
confronted
orlando
who
hastened
to
dismiss
his
trouble
at
her
approach
she
said
quite
gaily
mr
brotherson
heard
your
voice
and
is
glad
to
know
that
you
re
here
he
bade
me
give
you
this
key
and
say
that
you
would
have
found
things
in
better
shape
if
he
had
been
in
condition
to
superintend
the
removal
of
the
boxes
to
the
place
he
had
prepared
for
you
before
he
became
ill
i
was
the
one
to
do
that
she
added
controlling
her
aversion
with
manifest
effort
when
brotherson
came
to
himself
he
asked
if
i
had
heard
about
any
large
boxes
having
arrived
at
the
station
shipped
to
his
name
i
said
that
several
notices
of
such
had
come
to
the
house
at
which
he
requested
me
to
see
that
they
were
carried
at
once
to
the
strange
looking
shed
he
had
had
put
up
for
him
in
the
woods
i
thought
that
they
were
for
him
and
i
saw
to
the
thing
myself
two
or
three
others
have
come
since
and
been
taken
to
the
same
place
i
think
you
will
find
nothing
broken
or
disturbed
brotherson
s
wishes
are
usually
that
is
fortunate
for
me
was
the
courteous
reply
but
orlando
brotherson
was
not
himself
not
at
all
himself
as
he
bowed
a
formal
adieu
and
withdrew
past
the
figure
of
challoner
without
a
motion
on
his
part
or
on
the
part
of
that
gentleman
to
lighten
an
exit
which
had
something
in
it
of
doom
and
dread
presage
xxx
chaos
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
challoner
s
feelings
or
even
those
of
doris
at
the
moment
of
brotherson
s
departure
but
why
this
change
in
brotherson
himself
why
this
sense
of
something
new
and
terrible
rising
between
him
and
the
suddenly
beclouded
future
let
us
follow
him
to
his
lonely
and
see
if
we
can
solve
the
puzzle
but
first
does
he
understand
his
own
trouble
he
does
not
seem
to
for
when
his
hat
thrown
aside
he
stops
erect
and
frowning
under
the
flaring
he
had
no
recollection
of
lighting
his
first
act
was
to
lift
his
hand
to
his
head
in
a
gesture
of
surprising
helplessness
for
him
while
snatches
of
broken
sentences
fell
from
his
lips
among
which
could
be
heard
what
has
come
to
me
undone
in
an
hour
doubly
undone
first
by
a
face
and
then
by
this
thought
which
surely
the
devils
have
whispered
to
me
challoner
and
oswald
what
is
the
link
between
them
great
god
what
is
the
link
not
myself
who
then
or
what
flinging
himself
into
a
chair
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
there
were
two
demons
to
fight
the
first
in
the
guise
of
an
angel
doris
unknown
yesterday
unknown
an
hour
ago
but
now
had
there
ever
been
a
day
an
hour
when
she
had
not
been
as
the
very
throb
of
his
heart
the
light
of
his
eyes
and
the
crown
of
all
imaginable
blisses
he
was
startled
at
his
own
emotion
as
he
contemplated
her
image
in
his
fancy
and
listened
for
the
lost
echo
of
the
few
words
she
had
spoken
words
so
full
of
music
when
they
referred
to
his
brother
so
hard
and
cold
when
she
simply
addressed
himself
this
was
no
passing
admiration
of
youth
for
a
captivating
woman
this
was
not
even
the
love
he
had
given
to
edith
challoner
this
was
something
springing
out
of
nothing
a
force
which
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
made
him
complaisant
to
the
natural
weaknesses
of
man
a
dream
and
yet
a
reality
strong
enough
to
blot
out
the
past
remake
the
present
change
the
aspect
of
all
his
hopes
and
outline
a
new
fate
he
did
not
know
himself
there
was
nothing
in
his
whole
history
to
give
him
an
understanding
of
such
feelings
as
these
can
a
man
be
seized
as
it
were
by
the
hair
and
swung
up
on
the
slopes
of
paradise
or
down
the
steeps
of
hell
without
a
forewarning
without
the
chance
even
to
say
whether
he
wished
such
a
cataclysm
in
his
life
or
no
he
orlando
brotherson
had
never
thought
much
of
love
science
had
been
his
mistress
ambition
his
such
feeling
as
he
had
acknowledged
to
had
been
for
men
struggling
men
men
who
were
and
gasping
in
the
narrow
bounds
of
poverty
and
helplessness
miss
challoner
had
roused
well
his
pride
he
could
see
that
now
the
might
of
this
new
emotion
made
plain
many
things
he
had
passed
by
as
useless
puerile
unworthy
of
a
man
of
mental
calibre
and
might
he
had
never
loved
edith
challoner
at
any
moment
of
their
acquaintanceship
though
he
had
been
sincere
in
thinking
that
he
did
doris
beauty
the
hour
he
had
just
passed
with
her
had
undeceived
him
did
he
hail
the
experience
it
was
not
likely
to
bring
him
joy
this
young
girl
whose
image
floated
in
light
before
his
eyes
would
never
love
him
she
loved
his
brother
he
had
heard
their
names
mentioned
together
before
he
had
been
in
town
an
hour
oswald
the
cleverest
man
doris
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
western
pennsylvania
he
had
accepted
the
gossip
then
he
had
not
seen
her
and
it
all
seemed
very
natural
hardly
worth
a
moment
s
thought
but
now
and
here
the
other
demon
sprang
erect
and
grappled
with
him
before
the
first
one
had
let
go
his
hold
oswald
and
challoner
the
secret
unknown
something
which
had
softened
that
hard
man
s
eye
when
his
brother
s
name
was
mentioned
he
had
noted
it
and
realised
the
mystery
a
mystery
before
which
sleep
and
rest
must
fly
a
mystery
to
which
he
must
now
give
his
thought
whatever
the
cost
whatever
the
loss
to
those
heavenly
dreams
the
magic
of
which
was
so
new
it
seemed
to
envelope
him
in
the
balm
of
paradise
away
then
image
of
light
let
the
faculties
thou
hast
dazed
act
again
there
is
more
than
fate
s
caprice
in
challoner
s
interest
in
a
man
he
never
saw
ghosts
of
old
memories
rise
and
demand
a
hearing
facts
trivial
and
commonplace
enough
to
have
been
lost
in
oblivion
with
the
day
which
gave
them
birth
throng
again
from
the
past
proving
that
nought
dies
without
a
possibility
of
resurrection
their
power
over
this
brooding
man
is
shown
by
the
force
with
which
his
fingers
crush
against
his
bowed
forehead
oswald
and
challoner
had
he
found
the
connecting
link
had
it
been
could
it
have
been
edith
the
preposterous
is
sometimes
true
could
it
be
true
in
this
case
he
recalled
the
letters
read
to
him
as
hers
in
that
room
of
his
in
brooklyn
he
had
hardly
noted
them
then
he
was
so
sure
of
their
being
forgeries
gotten
up
by
the
police
to
mislead
him
could
they
have
been
real
the
effusions
of
her
mind
the
breathings
of
her
heart
directed
to
an
actual
o
and
that
o
his
brother
they
had
not
been
meant
for
him
he
had
read
enough
of
the
mawkish
lines
to
be
sure
of
that
none
of
the
allusions
fitted
in
with
the
facts
of
their
mutual
intercourse
but
they
might
with
those
of
another
man
they
might
with
the
possible
acts
and
affections
of
oswald
whose
temperament
was
wholly
different
from
his
and
who
might
have
loved
her
should
it
ever
be
shown
that
they
had
met
and
known
each
other
and
this
was
not
an
impossibility
oswald
had
been
east
oswald
had
even
been
in
the
berkshires
before
himself
oswald
why
it
was
oswald
who
had
suggested
that
he
should
go
there
go
where
she
still
was
why
this
second
coincidence
if
there
were
no
tie
if
the
challoners
and
oswald
were
as
far
apart
as
they
seemed
and
as
conventionalities
would
naturally
place
them
oswald
was
a
sentimentalist
but
very
reserved
about
his
sentimentalities
if
these
suppositions
were
true
he
had
had
a
sentimentalist
s
motive
for
what
he
did
as
orlando
realised
this
he
rose
from
his
seat
aghast
at
the
possibilities
confronting
him
from
this
line
of
thought
should
he
contemplate
them
risk
his
reason
by
dwelling
on
a
supposition
which
might
have
no
foundation
in
fact
no
his
brain
was
too
full
his
purposes
too
important
for
any
unnecessary
strain
to
be
put
upon
his
faculties
no
thinking
investigation
first
challoner
should
be
able
to
settle
this
question
he
would
see
him
even
at
this
late
hour
he
ought
to
be
able
to
find
him
in
one
of
the
rooms
below
and
by
the
force
of
an
irresistible
demand
learn
in
a
moment
whether
he
had
to
do
with
a
mere
chimera
of
his
own
overwrought
fancy
or
with
a
fact
which
would
call
into
play
all
the
resources
of
an
hitherto
unconquered
and
undaunted
nature
there
was
a
burning
in
the
that
night
and
around
it
was
grouped
a
number
of
men
with
their
papers
and
pipes
brotherson
entering
naturally
looked
that
way
for
the
man
he
was
in
search
of
and
was
disappointed
not
to
find
him
there
but
on
casting
his
glances
elsewhere
he
was
relieved
to
see
him
standing
in
one
of
the
windows
overlooking
the
street
his
back
was
to
the
room
and
he
seemed
to
be
lost
in
a
fit
of
abstraction
as
orlando
crossed
to
him
he
had
time
to
observe
how
much
whiter
was
this
man
s
head
than
in
the
last
interview
he
had
held
with
him
in
the
coroner
s
office
in
new
york
but
this
evidence
of
grief
in
one
with
whom
he
had
little
if
anything
in
common
neither
touched
his
feelings
nor
deterred
his
step
the
awakening
of
his
heart
to
new
and
profound
emotions
had
not
softened
him
towards
the
sufferings
of
others
if
those
others
stood
without
the
pale
he
had
previously
raised
as
the
legitimate
boundary
of
a
just
man
s
sympathies
he
was
as
i
have
said
an
extraordinary
specimen
of
manly
vigour
in
body
and
in
mind
and
his
presence
in
any
company
always
attracted
attention
and
roused
if
it
never
satisfied
curiosity
conversation
accordingly
ceased
as
he
strode
up
to
challoner
s
side
so
that
his
words
were
quite
audible
as
he
addressed
that
gentleman
with
a
somewhat
curt
you
see
me
again
challoner
may
i
beg
of
you
a
few
minutes
further
conversation
i
will
not
detain
you
the
grey
head
turned
and
the
many
eyes
watching
showed
surprise
at
the
expression
of
dislike
and
repulsion
with
which
this
new
york
gentleman
met
the
request
thus
emphatically
urged
but
his
answer
was
courteous
enough
if
brotherson
knew
a
place
where
they
would
be
left
undisturbed
he
would
listen
to
him
if
he
would
be
very
brief
for
reply
the
other
pointed
to
a
small
room
quite
unoccupied
which
opened
out
of
the
one
in
which
they
then
stood
challoner
bowed
and
in
an
other
moment
the
door
closed
upon
them
to
the
infinite
disappointment
of
the
men
about
the
hearth
what
do
you
wish
to
ask
was
challoner
s
immediate
inquiry
this
i
make
no
apologies
and
expect
in
answer
nothing
more
than
an
unequivocal
yes
or
no
you
tell
me
that
you
have
never
met
my
brother
can
that
be
said
of
the
other
members
of
your
family
of
your
deceased
daughter
in
fact
she
was
acquainted
with
oswald
brotherson
she
without
your
knowledge
entirely
corresponded
with
him
not
how
not
exactly
he
wrote
to
her
occasionally
she
wrote
to
him
frequently
but
she
never
sent
her
ah
the
exclamation
was
sharp
short
and
conveyed
little
yet
with
its
escape
the
whole
scaffolding
of
this
man
s
hold
upon
life
and
his
own
fate
went
down
in
indistinguishable
chaos
challoner
realised
a
sense
of
havoc
though
the
eyes
bent
upon
his
countenance
had
not
wavered
nor
the
stalwart
figure
moved
i
have
read
some
of
those
letters
the
inventor
finally
acknowledged
the
police
took
great
pains
to
place
them
under
my
eye
supposing
them
to
have
been
meant
for
me
because
of
the
initials
written
on
the
wrapper
but
they
were
meant
for
oswald
you
believe
that
now
i
know
and
that
is
why
i
found
you
in
the
same
house
with
it
is
providence
has
robbed
me
of
my
daughter
if
this
brother
of
yours
should
prove
to
be
the
man
i
am
led
to
expect
i
shall
ask
him
to
take
that
place
in
my
heart
and
life
which
was
once
a
quick
recoil
a
smothered
exclamation
on
the
part
of
the
man
he
addressed
a
barb
had
been
hidden
in
this
simple
statement
which
had
reached
some
but
vulnerable
spot
in
brotherson
s
breast
which
had
never
been
pierced
before
his
eye
which
alone
seemed
alive
still
rested
piercingly
upon
that
of
challoner
but
its
light
was
fast
fading
and
speedily
became
lost
in
a
dimness
in
which
the
other
seemed
to
see
extinguished
the
last
upflaring
embers
of
those
inner
fires
which
feed
the
aspiring
soul
it
was
a
sight
no
man
could
see
unmoved
challoner
turned
sharply
away
in
dread
of
the
abyss
which
the
next
word
he
uttered
might
open
between
them
but
orlando
brotherson
possessed
resources
of
strength
of
which
possibly
he
was
not
aware
himself
when
challoner
still
more
affected
by
the
silence
than
by
the
dread
i
have
mentioned
turned
to
confront
him
again
it
was
to
find
his
features
composed
and
his
glance
clear
he
had
conquered
all
outward
manifestation
of
the
mysterious
emotion
which
for
an
instant
had
laid
his
proud
spirit
low
you
are
considerate
of
my
brother
were
the
words
with
which
he
this
painful
conversation
you
will
not
find
your
confidence
misplaced
oswald
is
a
straightforward
fellow
of
few
i
believe
it
no
man
can
be
so
universally
beloved
without
some
very
substantial
claims
to
regard
i
am
glad
to
see
that
your
opinion
though
given
somewhat
coldly
coincides
with
that
of
his
i
am
not
given
to
exaggeration
was
the
even
reply
the
flush
which
had
come
into
challoner
s
cheek
under
the
effort
he
had
made
to
sustain
with
unflinching
heroism
this
interview
with
the
man
he
looked
upon
as
his
mortal
enemy
slowly
faded
out
till
he
looked
the
wraith
of
himself
even
to
the
unsympathetic
eyes
of
orlando
brotherson
a
duty
lay
before
him
which
would
tax
to
its
utmost
extent
his
already
greatly
weakened
nothing
which
had
yet
passed
showed
that
this
man
realised
the
fact
that
oswald
had
been
kept
in
ignorance
of
miss
challoner
s
death
if
these
brothers
were
to
meet
on
the
morrow
it
must
be
with
the
full
understanding
that
this
especial
topic
was
to
be
completely
avoided
but
in
what
words
could
he
urge
such
a
request
upon
this
man
none
suggested
themselves
yet
he
had
promised
miss
scott
that
he
would
ensure
his
silence
in
this
regard
and
it
was
with
this
difficulty
and
no
other
he
had
been
struggling
when
brotherson
came
upon
him
in
the
other
room
you
have
still
something
to
say
suggested
the
latter
as
an
oppressive
silence
swallowed
up
that
icy
sentence
i
have
already
recorded
i
have
returned
challoner
regaining
his
courage
under
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
miss
scott
is
very
anxious
to
have
your
promise
that
you
will
avoid
all
disagreeable
topics
with
your
brother
till
the
doctor
pronounces
him
strong
enough
to
meet
the
trouble
which
awaits
you
mean
he
is
not
as
unhappy
as
we
he
knows
nothing
of
the
affliction
which
has
befallen
him
he
was
taken
ill
the
rest
was
almost
inaudible
but
orlando
brotherson
had
no
difficulty
in
understanding
him
and
for
the
second
time
in
this
extraordinary
interview
he
gave
evidences
of
agitation
and
of
a
mind
shaken
from
its
equipoise
but
only
for
an
instant
he
did
not
shun
the
other
s
gaze
or
even
maintain
more
than
a
momentary
silence
indeed
he
found
strength
to
smile
in
a
curious
sardonic
way
as
he
said
do
you
think
i
should
be
apt
to
broach
this
subject
with
any
one
let
alone
with
him
whose
connection
with
it
i
shall
need
days
to
realise
i
m
not
so
given
to
gossip
besides
he
and
i
have
other
topics
of
interest
i
have
an
invention
ready
with
which
i
propose
to
experiment
in
a
place
he
has
already
prepared
for
me
we
can
talk
about
the
irony
the
hardy
with
which
this
was
said
struck
challoner
to
the
heart
without
a
word
he
wheeled
about
towards
the
door
without
a
word
brotherson
stood
watching
him
go
till
he
saw
his
hand
fall
on
the
knob
when
he
quietly
prevented
his
exit
by
saying
unhappy
truths
can
not
be
long
concealed
how
soon
does
the
doctor
think
my
brother
can
bear
these
inevitable
revelations
he
said
this
morning
that
if
his
patient
were
as
well
as
his
present
condition
gives
promise
of
he
might
be
told
in
another
orlando
bowed
his
appreciation
of
this
fact
but
added
quickly
who
is
to
do
the
telling
doris
nobody
else
could
be
trusted
with
so
delicate
a
i
wish
to
be
challoner
looked
up
surprised
at
the
feeling
with
which
this
request
was
charged
as
his
brother
his
only
remaining
relative
i
have
that
right
do
you
think
that
dor
that
miss
scott
can
be
trusted
not
to
forestall
that
moment
by
any
previous
hint
of
what
awaits
him
if
she
so
promises
but
will
you
exact
this
from
her
it
surely
can
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
say
that
your
presence
will
add
infinitely
to
the
difficulty
of
her
yet
it
is
a
duty
i
can
not
shirk
i
will
consult
the
doctor
about
it
i
will
make
him
see
that
i
both
understand
and
shall
insist
upon
my
rights
in
this
matter
but
you
may
tell
miss
doris
that
i
will
sit
out
of
sight
and
that
i
shall
not
obtrude
myself
unless
my
name
is
brought
up
in
an
undesirable
the
hand
on
the
made
a
sudden
movement
mr
brotherson
i
can
bear
no
more
with
your
permission
i
will
leave
this
question
to
be
settled
by
and
with
a
repetition
of
his
former
bow
the
bereaved
father
withdrew
orlando
watched
him
till
the
door
closed
then
he
too
dropped
his
mask
but
it
was
on
again
when
in
a
little
while
he
passed
through
the
on
his
way
upstairs
no
other
day
in
his
whole
life
had
been
like
this
to
the
hardy
inventor
for
in
it
both
his
heart
and
his
conscience
had
been
awakened
and
up
to
this
hour
he
had
not
really
known
that
he
possessed
either
xxxi
what
is
he
making
other
boxes
addressed
to
brotherson
had
been
received
at
the
station
and
carried
to
the
mysterious
shed
in
the
woods
and
now
with
locked
door
and
lifted
top
the
elder
brother
contemplated
his
stores
and
prepared
himself
for
work
he
had
been
allowed
a
short
interview
with
oswald
and
he
had
indulged
himself
in
a
few
words
with
doris
but
he
had
left
those
memories
behind
with
other
and
more
serious
matters
nothing
that
could
unnerve
his
hand
or
weaken
his
insight
should
enter
this
spot
sacred
to
his
great
hope
here
genius
reigned
here
he
was
himself
wholly
and
without
flaw
a
titan
with
his
grasp
on
a
mechanical
idea
by
means
of
which
he
would
soon
rule
the
world
not
so
happy
were
the
other
characters
in
this
drama
oswald
s
thoughts
disturbed
for
a
short
time
by
the
somewhat
constrained
interview
he
had
held
with
his
brother
had
flown
eastward
again
in
silent
love
and
longing
while
doris
with
a
double
dread
now
in
her
heart
went
about
her
daily
tasks
praying
for
strength
to
endure
the
horrors
of
this
week
without
betraying
the
anxieties
secretly
devouring
her
and
she
was
only
seventeen
and
quite
alone
in
her
trouble
she
must
bear
it
all
unassisted
and
smile
which
she
did
with
heavenly
sweetness
when
the
magic
threshold
was
passed
and
she
stood
in
her
invalid
s
presence
overshadowed
though
it
ever
was
by
the
great
dread
and
challoner
let
those
endless
walks
of
his
through
the
woods
and
over
the
hills
tell
his
story
if
they
can
or
his
rapidly
whitening
hair
and
lagging
step
he
had
been
a
strong
man
before
his
trouble
and
had
the
stroke
which
laid
him
low
been
limited
to
one
quick
sharp
blow
he
might
have
risen
above
it
after
a
while
and
been
ready
to
encounter
life
again
but
this
long
drawn
out
misery
was
proving
too
much
for
him
the
sight
of
brotherson
though
they
never
really
met
acted
like
acid
upon
a
wound
and
it
was
not
till
six
days
had
passed
and
the
dreaded
sunday
was
at
hand
that
he
slept
with
any
sense
of
rest
or
went
his
way
about
the
town
without
that
halting
at
the
corners
which
betrayed
his
perpetual
apprehension
of
a
most
undesirable
encounter
the
reason
for
this
change
will
be
apparent
in
the
short
conversation
he
held
with
a
man
he
had
come
upon
one
evening
in
the
small
park
just
beyond
the
workmen
s
dwellings
you
see
i
am
here
was
the
stranger
s
low
greeting
thank
god
was
challoner
s
reply
i
could
not
have
faced
alone
and
i
doubt
if
miss
scott
could
have
found
the
requisite
courage
does
she
know
that
you
are
here
i
stopped
at
her
was
that
safe
i
think
so
brotherson
the
brooklyn
one
is
up
in
his
shed
he
sleeps
there
now
i
am
told
and
soundly
too
i
ve
no
what
is
he
making
what
half
the
inventors
on
both
sides
of
the
water
are
engaged
upon
just
now
a
monoplane
or
a
biplane
or
some
machine
for
carrying
men
through
the
air
i
know
for
i
helped
him
with
it
but
you
ll
find
that
if
he
succeeds
in
this
undertaking
and
i
believe
he
will
nothing
short
of
fame
awaits
him
his
invention
has
startling
points
but
i
m
not
going
to
give
them
away
i
ll
be
true
enough
to
him
for
that
as
an
inventor
he
has
my
sympathy
but
well
we
will
see
what
we
shall
see
you
say
that
he
is
bound
to
be
present
when
miss
scott
relates
her
tragic
story
he
won
t
be
the
only
unseen
listener
i
ve
made
my
own
arrangements
with
miss
scott
if
he
feels
the
need
of
watching
her
and
his
brother
oswald
i
feel
the
need
of
watching
you
take
a
burden
of
intolerable
weight
from
my
shoulders
now
i
shall
feel
easier
about
that
interview
but
i
should
like
to
ask
you
this
do
you
feel
justified
in
this
continued
surveillance
of
a
man
who
has
so
frequently
and
with
such
evident
sincerity
declared
his
innocence
i
do
that
if
he
s
as
guiltless
as
he
says
he
is
my
watchfulness
won
t
hurt
him
if
he
s
not
then
challoner
i
ve
but
one
duty
to
match
his
strength
with
my
patience
that
man
is
the
one
great
mystery
of
the
day
and
mysteries
call
for
solution
at
least
that
s
the
way
a
detective
looks
at
may
heaven
help
your
efforts
i
shall
need
its
assistance
was
the
dry
rejoinder
sweetwater
was
by
no
means
blind
to
the
difficulties
awaiting
him
xxxii
tell
me
tell
it
all
the
day
was
a
grey
one
the
first
of
the
kind
in
weeks
as
doris
stepped
into
the
room
where
oswald
sat
she
felt
how
much
a
ray
of
sunshine
would
have
encouraged
her
and
yet
how
truly
these
leaden
skies
and
this
dismal
atmosphere
expressed
the
gloom
which
soon
must
fall
upon
this
hopeful
smiling
man
he
smiled
because
any
man
must
smile
at
the
entrance
of
so
lovely
a
woman
but
it
was
an
abstracted
smile
and
doris
seeing
it
felt
her
courage
falter
for
a
moment
though
her
steps
did
not
nor
her
steady
compassionate
gaze
advancing
slowly
and
not
answering
because
she
did
not
hear
some
casual
remark
of
his
she
took
her
stand
by
his
side
and
then
slowly
and
with
her
eyes
on
his
face
sank
down
upon
her
knees
still
without
speaking
almost
without
breathing
his
astonishment
was
evident
for
her
air
was
strange
and
full
of
presage
as
indeed
she
had
meant
it
to
be
but
he
remained
as
silent
as
she
only
reached
out
his
emaciated
hand
and
laying
it
on
her
head
smiled
again
but
this
time
far
from
abstractedly
then
as
he
saw
her
cheeks
pale
in
terror
of
the
task
before
her
he
ventured
to
ask
gently
what
is
the
matter
child
so
weary
eh
nothing
worse
than
that
i
are
you
quite
strong
this
morning
strong
enough
to
listen
to
my
troubles
strong
enough
to
bear
your
own
if
god
sees
fit
to
send
them
came
hesitatingly
from
her
lips
as
she
watched
the
effect
of
each
word
in
breathless
anxiety
troubles
there
can
be
but
one
trouble
for
me
was
his
unexpected
reply
that
i
do
not
fear
will
not
fear
in
my
hour
of
happy
recovery
so
long
as
edith
is
well
doris
doris
you
alarm
me
edith
is
not
ill
not
ill
the
poor
child
could
not
answer
save
with
her
sympathetic
look
and
halting
tremulous
breath
and
these
signs
he
would
not
could
not
read
his
own
words
had
made
such
an
echo
in
his
ears
ill
i
can
not
imagine
edith
ill
i
always
see
her
in
my
thoughts
as
i
saw
her
on
that
day
of
our
first
meeting
a
perfect
animated
woman
with
the
joyous
look
of
a
glad
harmonious
nature
nothing
has
ever
clouded
that
vision
if
she
were
ill
i
would
have
known
it
we
are
so
truly
one
that
doris
doris
you
do
not
speak
you
know
the
depth
of
my
love
the
terror
of
my
thoughts
is
edith
ill
the
eyes
gazing
wildly
into
his
slowly
left
his
face
and
raised
themselves
aloft
with
a
sublime
look
would
he
understand
yes
he
understood
and
the
cry
which
rang
from
his
lips
stopped
for
a
moment
the
beating
of
more
than
one
heart
in
that
little
cottage
dead
he
shrieked
out
and
fell
back
fainting
in
his
chair
his
lips
still
murmuring
in
dead
dead
doris
sprang
to
her
feet
thinking
of
nothing
but
his
wavering
slipping
life
till
she
saw
his
breath
return
his
eyes
refill
with
light
then
the
horror
of
what
was
yet
to
come
the
answer
which
must
be
given
to
the
how
she
saw
trembling
on
his
lips
caused
her
to
sink
again
upon
her
knees
in
an
unconscious
appeal
for
strength
if
that
one
sad
revelation
had
been
all
but
the
rest
must
be
told
his
brother
exacted
it
and
so
did
the
situation
further
waiting
further
hiding
of
the
truth
would
be
insupportable
after
this
but
oh
the
bitterness
of
it
no
wonder
that
she
turned
away
from
those
frenzied
eyes
doris
she
trembled
and
looked
behind
her
she
had
not
recognised
his
voice
had
another
entered
had
his
brother
dared
no
they
were
alone
seemingly
so
that
is
she
knew
no
one
better
that
they
were
not
really
alone
that
witnesses
were
within
hearing
if
not
within
sight
doris
he
urged
again
and
this
time
she
turned
in
his
direction
and
gazed
aghast
if
the
voice
were
strange
what
of
the
face
which
now
confronted
her
the
ravages
of
sickness
had
been
marked
but
they
were
nothing
to
those
made
in
an
instant
by
a
blasting
grief
she
was
startled
although
expecting
much
and
could
only
press
his
hands
while
she
waited
for
the
question
he
was
gathering
strength
to
utter
it
was
simple
when
it
came
just
two
words
how
long
she
answered
them
as
simply
just
as
long
as
you
have
been
ill
said
she
then
with
no
attempt
to
break
the
inevitable
shock
she
went
on
miss
challoner
was
struck
dead
and
you
were
taken
down
with
typhoid
on
the
struck
dead
why
do
you
use
that
word
struck
struck
dead
she
a
young
woman
oh
doris
an
accident
my
darling
has
been
killed
in
an
accident
they
do
not
call
it
accident
they
call
it
what
it
never
was
what
it
never
was
she
insisted
pressing
him
back
with
frightened
hands
as
he
strove
to
rise
miss
challoner
was
how
nearly
the
word
shot
had
left
her
lips
how
fiercely
above
all
else
in
that
harrowing
moment
had
risen
the
desire
to
fling
the
accusation
of
that
word
into
the
ears
of
him
who
listened
from
his
secret
but
she
refrained
out
of
compassion
for
the
man
she
loved
and
declared
instead
miss
challoner
died
from
a
wound
how
given
why
given
no
one
knows
i
had
rather
have
died
myself
than
have
to
tell
you
this
oh
brotherson
speak
sob
do
anything
but
she
started
back
dropping
his
hands
as
she
did
so
with
quick
intuition
she
saw
that
he
must
be
left
to
himself
if
he
were
to
meet
this
blow
without
succumbing
the
body
must
have
freedom
if
the
spirit
would
not
go
mad
conscious
or
perhaps
not
conscious
of
his
release
from
her
restraining
hand
albeit
profiting
by
it
he
staggered
to
his
feet
murmuring
that
word
of
doom
wound
wound
my
darling
died
of
a
wound
what
kind
of
a
wound
he
suddenly
thundered
out
i
can
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
wound
make
it
clear
to
me
make
it
clear
to
me
at
once
if
i
must
bear
this
grief
let
me
know
its
whole
depth
leave
nothing
to
my
imagination
or
i
can
not
answer
for
myself
tell
it
all
and
doris
told
him
she
was
on
the
mezzanine
floor
of
the
hotel
where
she
lives
she
was
seemingly
happy
and
had
been
writing
a
letter
a
letter
to
me
which
they
never
forwarded
there
was
no
one
else
by
but
some
strangers
good
people
whom
one
must
believe
she
was
crossing
the
floor
when
suddenly
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
fell
a
thin
narrow
was
in
her
grasp
and
it
flew
into
the
lobby
some
say
she
struck
herself
with
that
cutter
for
when
they
picked
her
up
they
found
a
wound
in
her
breast
which
that
cutter
might
have
edith
never
the
words
were
chokingly
said
he
was
swaying
almost
falling
but
he
steadied
himself
who
says
that
he
asked
it
was
the
coroner
s
and
she
died
that
way
died
after
writing
to
you
what
was
in
that
letter
nothing
of
threat
they
say
only
just
cheer
and
expressions
of
hope
just
like
the
others
and
they
accuse
her
of
taking
her
own
life
their
verdict
is
a
lie
they
did
not
know
then
after
some
moments
of
wild
and
confused
feeling
he
declared
with
a
desperate
effort
at
you
said
that
some
believe
this
then
there
must
be
others
who
do
not
what
do
they
say
nothing
they
simply
feel
as
you
do
they
see
no
reason
for
the
act
and
no
evidence
of
her
having
meditated
it
her
father
and
her
friend
insist
besides
that
she
was
incapable
of
such
a
horror
the
mystery
of
it
is
killing
us
all
me
above
others
for
i
ve
had
to
show
you
a
cheerful
face
with
my
brain
reeling
and
my
heart
like
lead
in
my
she
held
out
her
hands
she
tried
to
draw
his
attention
to
herself
not
from
any
sentiment
of
egotism
but
to
break
if
she
could
the
strain
of
these
insupportable
horrors
where
so
short
a
time
before
hope
sang
and
life
revelled
in
joys
perhaps
some
faint
realisation
of
this
reached
him
for
presently
he
caught
her
by
the
hands
and
bowed
his
head
upon
her
shoulder
and
finally
let
her
seat
him
again
before
he
said
do
they
know
of
of
my
interest
in
this
yes
they
know
about
the
two
the
two
he
was
on
his
feet
again
but
only
for
a
moment
his
weakness
was
greater
than
his
will
power
orlando
and
oswald
brotherson
she
explained
in
answer
to
his
broken
appeal
your
brother
wrote
letters
to
her
as
well
as
you
and
signed
them
just
as
you
did
with
his
initials
only
these
letters
were
found
in
her
desk
and
he
was
supposed
for
a
time
to
have
been
the
author
of
all
that
were
so
signed
but
they
found
out
the
difference
after
awhile
yours
were
easily
recognised
after
they
learned
there
was
another
o
who
loved
the
words
were
plain
enough
but
the
stricken
listener
did
not
take
them
in
they
carried
no
meaning
to
him
how
should
they
the
very
idea
she
sought
to
impress
upon
him
by
this
seemingly
careless
allusion
was
an
incredible
one
she
found
it
her
dreadful
task
to
tell
him
the
hard
bare
truth
your
brother
said
she
was
devoted
to
miss
challoner
too
he
even
wanted
to
marry
her
i
can
not
keep
back
this
fact
it
is
known
everywhere
and
by
everybody
but
orlando
his
lips
took
an
ironical
curve
as
he
uttered
the
word
this
was
a
young
girl
s
imaginative
fancy
to
him
why
orlando
never
knew
her
never
saw
her
never
he
met
her
at
the
name
produced
its
effect
he
stared
made
an
effort
to
think
repeated
lenox
over
to
himself
then
suddenly
lost
his
hold
upon
the
idea
which
that
word
suggested
struggled
again
for
it
seized
it
in
an
instant
of
madness
and
shouted
out
yes
yes
i
remember
i
sent
him
there
and
paused
his
mind
blank
again
poor
doris
frightened
to
her
very
soul
looked
blindly
about
for
help
but
she
did
not
quit
his
side
she
did
not
dare
to
for
his
lips
had
reopened
the
continuity
of
his
thoughts
had
returned
he
was
going
to
speak
i
sent
him
the
words
came
in
a
sort
of
shout
i
was
so
hungry
to
hear
of
her
and
i
thought
he
might
mention
her
in
his
letter
insane
insane
he
saw
her
and
what
s
that
you
said
about
his
loving
her
he
couldn
t
have
loved
her
he
s
not
of
the
loving
sort
they
ve
deceived
you
with
strange
tales
they
ve
deceived
the
whole
world
with
fancies
and
mad
dreams
he
may
have
admired
her
but
loved
her
no
or
if
he
had
he
would
have
respected
my
he
did
not
know
a
laugh
a
laugh
which
paled
doris
cheek
then
his
tones
grew
even
again
memory
came
back
and
he
muttered
faintly
that
is
true
i
said
nothing
to
him
he
had
the
right
to
court
her
and
he
did
you
say
wrote
to
her
imposed
himself
upon
her
drove
her
mad
with
importunities
she
was
forced
to
rebuke
and
and
what
else
there
is
something
else
tell
me
i
will
know
it
he
was
standing
now
his
feebleness
all
gone
passion
in
every
lineament
and
his
eye
alive
and
feverish
with
emotion
tell
me
he
repeated
with
unrestrained
vehemence
tell
me
all
kill
me
with
sorrow
but
save
me
from
being
he
wrote
her
a
letter
it
frightened
her
he
followed
it
up
by
a
visit
doris
paused
the
sentence
hung
suspended
she
had
heard
a
step
a
hand
on
the
door
orlando
had
entered
the
room
xxxiii
alone
oswald
had
heard
nothing
seen
nothing
but
he
took
note
of
doris
silence
and
turning
towards
her
in
frenzy
saw
what
had
happened
and
so
was
in
a
measure
prepared
for
the
stern
short
sentence
which
now
rang
through
the
room
wait
miss
scott
you
tell
the
story
badly
let
him
listen
to
me
from
my
mouth
only
shall
he
hear
the
stern
and
seemingly
unnatural
part
i
played
in
this
family
the
face
of
oswald
hardened
those
pliant
features
beloved
for
their
gracious
kindliness
set
themselves
in
lines
which
altered
them
almost
beyond
recognition
but
his
voice
was
not
without
some
of
its
natural
sweetness
as
after
a
long
and
hollow
look
at
the
other
s
composed
countenance
he
abruptly
exclaimed
speak
i
am
bound
to
listen
you
are
my
orlando
turned
towards
doris
she
was
slipping
away
don
t
go
said
he
but
she
was
gone
slowly
he
turned
back
oswald
raised
his
hand
and
checked
the
words
with
which
he
would
have
begun
his
story
never
mind
the
beginnings
said
he
doris
has
told
all
that
you
saw
miss
challoner
in
lenox
admired
her
offered
yourself
to
her
and
afterwards
wrote
her
a
threatening
letter
because
she
rejected
it
is
true
other
men
have
followed
just
such
unworthy
impulses
and
been
ashamed
and
sorry
afterwards
i
was
sorry
and
i
was
ashamed
and
as
soon
as
my
first
anger
was
over
went
to
tell
her
so
but
she
mistook
my
purpose
and
and
what
orlando
hesitated
even
his
iron
nature
trembled
before
the
misery
he
saw
a
misery
he
was
destined
to
augment
rather
than
soothe
with
pains
altogether
out
of
keeping
with
his
character
he
sought
in
the
recesses
of
his
darkened
mind
for
words
less
bitter
and
less
abrupt
than
those
which
sprang
involuntarily
to
his
lips
but
he
did
not
find
them
though
he
pitied
his
brother
and
wished
to
show
that
he
did
nothing
but
the
stern
language
suitable
to
the
stern
fact
he
wished
to
impart
would
leave
his
lips
and
ended
the
pitiful
struggle
of
the
moment
with
one
quick
unpremeditated
blow
was
what
he
said
there
is
no
other
explanation
possible
for
this
act
oswald
bitter
as
it
is
for
me
to
acknowledge
it
i
am
thus
far
guilty
of
this
beloved
woman
s
death
but
as
god
hears
me
from
the
moment
i
first
saw
her
to
the
moment
i
saw
her
last
i
did
not
know
nor
did
i
for
a
moment
dream
that
she
was
anything
to
you
or
to
any
other
man
of
my
stamp
and
station
i
thought
she
despised
my
country
birth
my
mechanical
attempts
my
lack
of
aristocratic
pretensions
and
edith
now
that
i
know
she
had
other
reasons
for
her
contempt
that
the
words
she
wrote
were
in
rebuke
to
the
brother
rather
than
to
the
man
i
feel
my
guilt
and
deplore
my
anger
i
can
not
say
more
i
should
but
insult
your
grief
by
any
lengthy
expressions
of
regret
and
a
groan
of
intolerable
anguish
from
the
sick
man
s
lips
and
then
the
quick
thrust
of
his
intelligence
rising
superior
to
the
overthrow
of
all
his
hopes
for
a
woman
of
edith
s
principle
to
seek
death
in
a
moment
of
desperation
the
provocation
must
have
been
very
great
tell
me
if
i
m
to
hate
you
through
life
yea
through
all
eternity
or
if
i
must
seek
in
some
unimaginable
failure
of
my
own
character
or
conduct
the
cause
of
her
intolerable
oswald
the
tone
was
controlling
and
yet
that
of
one
strong
man
to
another
is
it
for
us
to
read
the
heart
of
any
woman
least
of
all
of
a
woman
of
her
susceptibilities
and
keen
inner
life
the
wish
to
end
all
comes
to
some
natures
like
a
lightning
flash
from
a
clear
sky
it
comes
it
goes
often
without
leaving
a
sign
but
if
a
weapon
chances
to
be
near
here
it
was
in
hand
then
death
follows
the
impulse
which
given
an
instant
of
thought
would
have
vanished
in
a
back
sweep
of
other
emotions
chance
was
the
real
accessory
to
this
death
by
suicide
oswald
let
us
realise
it
as
such
and
accept
our
sorrow
as
a
mutual
burden
and
turn
to
what
remains
to
us
of
life
and
labour
work
is
grief
s
only
consolation
then
let
us
but
of
all
this
oswald
had
caught
but
the
one
word
chance
he
repeated
orlando
i
believe
in
then
seek
your
comfort
there
i
find
it
in
harnessing
the
winds
in
forcing
the
powers
of
nature
to
do
my
the
other
did
not
speak
and
the
silence
grew
heavy
it
was
broken
when
it
was
broken
by
a
cry
from
oswald
no
more
said
he
no
then
in
a
yearning
accent
send
doris
to
orlando
started
this
name
coming
so
close
upon
that
word
comfort
produced
a
strange
effect
upon
him
but
another
look
at
oswald
and
he
was
ready
to
do
his
bidding
the
bitter
ordeal
was
over
let
him
have
his
solace
if
it
was
in
her
power
to
give
it
to
him
orlando
upon
leaving
his
brother
s
room
did
not
stop
to
deliver
that
brother
s
message
directly
to
doris
he
left
this
for
truda
to
do
and
retired
immediately
to
his
hangar
in
the
woods
locking
himself
in
he
slightly
raised
the
roof
and
then
sat
down
before
the
car
which
was
rapidly
taking
on
shape
and
assuming
that
individuality
and
appearance
of
sentient
life
which
hitherto
he
had
only
seen
in
dreams
but
his
eye
which
had
never
failed
to
kindle
at
this
sight
before
shone
dully
in
the
the
could
wait
he
would
first
have
his
hour
in
this
solitude
of
his
own
making
the
gaze
he
dreaded
the
words
from
which
he
shrank
could
not
penetrate
here
he
might
even
shout
her
name
aloud
and
only
these
windowless
walls
would
respond
he
was
alone
with
his
past
his
present
and
his
future
alone
he
needed
to
be
the
strongest
must
pause
when
the
precipice
yawns
before
him
the
gulf
can
be
spanned
he
feels
himself
forceful
enough
for
that
but
his
eyes
must
take
their
measurement
of
it
first
he
must
know
its
depths
and
possible
dangers
only
a
fool
would
ignore
these
steeps
of
jagged
rock
and
he
was
no
fool
only
a
man
to
whom
the
unexpected
had
happened
a
man
who
had
seen
his
way
clear
to
the
horizon
and
then
had
come
up
against
this
love
when
he
thought
such
folly
dead
remorse
when
glory
called
for
the
quiet
mind
and
heart
he
recognised
its
mordant
fang
and
knew
that
its
ravages
though
only
just
begun
would
last
his
lifetime
nothing
could
stop
them
now
nothing
nothing
and
he
laughed
as
the
thought
went
home
laughed
at
the
irony
of
fate
and
its
inexorableness
laughed
at
his
own
defeat
and
his
nearness
to
a
barred
paradise
oswald
loved
edith
loved
her
yet
with
a
flame
time
would
take
long
to
quench
doris
loved
oswald
and
he
doris
and
not
one
of
them
would
ever
attain
the
delights
each
was
so
fitted
to
enjoy
why
shouldn
t
he
laugh
what
is
left
to
man
but
mockery
when
all
props
fall
disappointment
was
the
universal
lot
and
it
should
go
merrily
with
him
if
he
must
take
his
turn
at
it
but
here
the
strong
spirit
of
the
man
itself
it
should
be
but
a
turn
a
man
s
joys
are
not
bounded
by
his
loves
or
even
by
the
satisfaction
of
a
perfectly
untrammelled
mind
performance
makes
a
world
of
its
own
for
the
capable
and
the
strong
and
this
was
still
left
to
him
he
orlando
brotherson
despair
while
his
great
work
lay
unfinished
that
would
be
to
lay
stress
on
the
inevitable
pains
and
fears
of
commonplace
humanity
he
was
not
of
that
ilk
intellect
was
his
god
ambition
his
motive
power
what
would
this
casual
blight
upon
his
supreme
contentment
be
to
him
when
with
the
wings
of
his
spread
he
should
spurn
the
earth
and
soar
into
the
heaven
of
fame
simultaneously
with
his
flight
into
the
open
he
could
wait
for
that
hour
he
had
measured
the
gulf
before
him
and
found
it
passable
henceforth
no
looking
back
rising
he
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
with
an
alert
eye
now
upon
such
sections
of
his
car
as
had
not
yet
been
fitted
into
their
places
then
he
bent
forward
to
his
work
and
soon
the
lips
which
had
uttered
that
sardonic
laugh
a
few
minutes
before
parted
in
gentler
fashion
and
song
took
the
place
of
curses
a
ballad
of
love
and
fondest
truth
but
orlando
never
knew
what
he
sang
he
had
the
gift
and
used
it
would
his
tones
however
have
rung
out
with
quite
so
mellow
a
sweetness
had
he
seen
the
restless
figure
even
then
circling
his
retreat
with
eyes
darting
accusation
and
arms
lifted
towards
him
in
wild
but
impotent
threat
yes
i
think
they
would
for
he
knew
that
the
man
who
thus
expressed
his
helplessness
along
with
his
convictions
was
no
nearer
the
end
he
had
set
himself
to
attain
than
on
the
day
he
first
betrayed
his
suspicions
xxxiv
the
hut
changes
its
name
that
night
oswald
was
taken
very
for
three
days
his
life
hung
in
the
balance
then
youth
and
healthy
living
triumphed
over
shock
and
bereavement
and
he
came
slowly
back
to
his
sad
and
crippled
existence
he
had
been
conscious
for
a
week
or
more
of
his
surroundings
and
of
his
bitter
sorrows
as
well
when
one
morning
he
asked
doris
whose
face
it
was
he
had
seen
bending
over
him
so
often
during
the
last
week
have
you
a
new
doctor
a
man
with
white
hair
and
a
comforting
smile
or
have
i
dreamed
this
face
i
have
had
so
many
fancies
this
might
easily
be
one
of
no
it
is
not
a
fancy
was
the
quiet
reply
nor
is
it
the
face
of
a
doctor
it
is
that
of
friend
one
whose
heart
is
bound
up
in
your
recovery
one
for
whom
you
must
live
i
don
t
know
him
doris
it
s
a
strange
face
to
me
and
yet
it
s
not
altogether
strange
who
is
this
man
and
why
should
he
care
for
me
so
deeply
because
you
share
one
love
and
one
grief
it
is
edith
s
father
whom
you
see
at
your
bedside
he
has
helped
to
nurse
you
ever
since
you
came
down
this
second
edith
s
father
doris
it
can
not
be
edith
s
father
yes
challoner
has
been
in
derby
for
the
last
two
weeks
he
has
only
one
interest
now
to
see
you
well
why
doris
caught
the
note
of
pain
if
not
suspicion
in
this
query
and
smiled
as
she
asked
in
turn
shall
he
answer
that
question
himself
he
is
waiting
to
come
in
not
to
talk
you
need
not
fear
his
talking
he
s
as
quiet
as
any
man
i
ever
the
sick
man
closed
his
eyes
and
doris
watching
saw
the
flush
rise
to
his
emaciated
cheek
then
slowly
fade
away
again
to
a
pallor
that
frightened
her
had
she
injured
where
she
would
heal
had
she
pressed
too
suddenly
and
too
hard
on
the
ever
gaping
wound
in
her
invalid
s
breast
she
gasped
in
terror
at
the
thought
then
she
faintly
smiled
for
his
eyes
had
opened
again
and
showed
a
calm
determination
as
he
said
i
should
like
to
see
him
i
should
like
him
to
answer
the
question
i
have
just
put
you
i
should
rest
easier
and
get
well
faster
or
not
get
well
at
this
latter
he
half
whispered
and
doris
tripping
from
the
room
may
not
have
heard
it
for
her
face
showed
no
further
shadow
as
she
ushered
in
challoner
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
she
had
looked
forward
to
this
moment
for
days
to
oswald
however
it
was
an
unexpected
excitement
and
his
voice
trembled
with
something
more
than
physical
weakness
as
he
greeted
his
visitor
and
thanked
him
for
his
attentions
doris
says
that
you
have
shown
me
this
kindness
from
the
desire
you
have
to
see
me
well
again
challoner
is
this
true
very
true
i
can
not
emphasise
the
fact
too
oswald
s
eyes
met
his
again
this
time
with
great
earnestness
you
must
have
serious
reasons
for
feeling
so
reasons
which
i
do
not
quite
understand
may
i
ask
why
you
place
such
value
upon
a
life
which
if
ever
useful
to
itself
or
others
has
lost
and
lost
forever
the
one
delight
which
gave
it
meaning
it
was
for
challoner
s
voice
to
tremble
now
as
reaching
out
his
hand
he
declared
with
unmistakable
feeling
i
have
no
son
i
have
no
interest
left
in
life
outside
this
room
and
the
possibilities
it
contains
for
me
your
attachment
to
my
daughter
has
created
a
bond
between
us
brotherson
which
i
sincerely
hope
to
see
recognised
by
startled
and
deeply
moved
the
young
man
stretched
out
a
shaking
hand
towards
his
visitor
with
the
feeble
but
exulting
cry
then
you
do
not
blame
me
for
her
wretched
and
mysterious
death
you
hold
me
guiltless
of
the
misery
which
nerved
her
despairing
arm
quite
oswald
s
wan
and
pinched
features
took
on
a
beautiful
expression
and
challoner
no
longer
wondered
at
his
daughter
s
choice
thank
god
fell
from
the
sick
man
s
lips
and
then
there
was
a
silence
during
which
their
two
hands
met
it
was
some
minutes
before
either
spoke
and
then
it
was
oswald
who
said
i
must
confide
to
you
certain
facts
i
honoured
your
daughter
and
realised
her
position
fully
our
plight
was
never
made
in
words
nor
should
i
have
presumed
to
advance
any
claim
to
her
hand
if
i
had
not
made
good
my
expectations
challoner
i
meant
to
win
both
her
regard
and
yours
by
acts
not
words
i
felt
that
i
had
a
great
deal
to
do
and
i
was
prepared
to
work
and
wait
i
loved
her
he
turned
away
his
head
and
the
silence
which
filled
up
the
gap
united
those
two
hearts
as
the
old
and
young
are
seldom
united
but
when
a
little
later
challoner
rejoined
doris
in
her
little
he
nevertheless
showed
a
perplexity
she
had
hoped
to
see
removed
by
this
understanding
with
the
younger
brotherson
the
cause
became
apparent
as
soon
as
he
spoke
these
brothers
hold
by
each
other
said
he
oswald
will
hear
nothing
against
orlando
he
says
that
he
has
redeemed
his
fault
he
does
not
even
protest
that
his
brother
s
word
is
to
be
believed
in
this
matter
he
does
not
seem
to
think
that
necessary
he
evidently
regards
orlando
s
personality
as
speaking
as
truly
and
satisfactorily
for
itself
as
his
own
does
and
i
dared
not
undeceive
he
does
not
know
all
our
reasons
for
distrust
he
has
heard
nothing
about
the
poor
no
and
he
must
not
not
for
weeks
he
has
borne
all
that
he
his
confidence
in
his
older
brother
is
sublime
i
do
not
share
it
but
i
can
not
help
but
respect
him
for
it
was
warmly
said
and
challoner
could
not
forbear
casting
an
anxious
look
at
her
upturned
face
what
he
saw
there
made
him
turn
away
with
a
sigh
this
confidence
has
for
me
a
very
unhappy
side
he
remarked
it
shows
me
oswald
s
thought
he
who
loved
her
best
accepts
the
cruel
verdict
of
an
unreasoning
doris
large
eyes
burned
with
a
weird
light
upon
his
face
he
has
not
had
my
dream
she
murmured
with
all
the
quiet
of
an
unmoved
conviction
yet
as
the
days
went
by
even
her
manner
changed
towards
the
busy
inventor
it
was
hardly
possible
for
it
not
to
the
high
stand
he
took
the
regard
accorded
him
on
every
side
his
talent
his
conversation
which
was
an
education
in
itself
and
above
all
his
absorption
in
a
work
daily
advancing
towards
completion
removed
him
so
insensibly
and
yet
so
decidedly
from
the
hideous
past
of
tragedy
with
which
his
name
if
not
his
honour
was
associated
that
unconsciously
to
herself
she
gradually
lost
her
icy
air
of
repulsion
and
lent
him
a
more
or
less
attentive
ear
when
he
chose
to
join
their
small
company
of
an
evening
the
result
was
that
he
turned
so
bright
a
side
upon
her
that
toleration
merged
from
day
to
day
into
admiration
and
memory
lost
itself
in
anticipation
of
the
event
which
was
to
prove
him
a
man
of
men
if
not
one
of
the
world
s
greatest
mechanical
geniuses
meantime
oswald
was
steadily
improving
in
health
if
not
in
spirits
he
had
taken
his
first
walk
without
any
unfavourable
results
and
orlando
decided
from
this
that
the
time
had
come
for
an
explanation
of
his
device
and
his
requirements
in
regard
to
it
seated
together
in
oswald
s
room
he
broached
the
subject
thus
oswald
what
is
your
idea
about
what
i
m
making
up
there
that
it
will
be
a
i
know
but
its
character
its
use
what
do
you
think
it
is
i
ve
an
idea
but
my
idea
don
t
fit
the
how
s
that
the
shed
is
too
closely
hemmed
in
you
haven
t
room
for
what
to
start
an
yet
it
is
certainly
a
device
for
i
supposed
so
but
it
is
an
with
a
new
and
valuable
idea
the
idea
for
which
the
whole
world
has
been
seeking
ever
since
the
first
aeroplane
found
its
way
up
from
the
earth
my
car
needs
no
room
to
start
in
save
that
which
it
occupies
if
it
did
it
would
be
but
the
modification
of
a
hundred
orlando
as
oswald
thus
gave
expression
to
his
surprise
their
two
faces
were
a
study
the
fire
of
genius
in
the
one
the
light
of
sympathetic
understanding
in
the
other
if
this
car
now
within
three
days
of
its
completion
orlando
proceeded
does
not
rise
from
the
oval
of
my
hangar
like
a
bird
from
its
nest
and
after
a
wide
and
circling
flight
descend
again
into
the
self
same
spot
without
any
swerving
from
its
direct
course
then
have
i
failed
in
my
endeavour
and
must
take
a
back
seat
with
the
rest
but
it
will
not
fail
i
m
certain
of
success
oswald
all
i
want
just
now
is
a
sympathetic
helper
you
for
instance
someone
who
will
aid
me
with
the
final
fittings
and
hold
his
peace
to
all
eternity
if
the
impossible
occurs
and
the
thing
proves
a
have
you
such
pride
as
that
so
much
that
you
can
not
face
failure
not
when
attached
to
my
name
you
can
see
how
i
feel
about
that
by
the
secrecy
i
have
worked
under
no
other
person
living
knows
what
i
have
just
communicated
to
you
every
part
shipped
here
came
from
different
manufacturing
firms
sometimes
a
part
of
a
part
was
all
i
allowed
to
be
made
in
any
one
place
my
fame
like
my
ship
must
rise
with
one
bound
into
the
air
or
it
must
never
rise
at
all
it
was
not
made
for
petty
accomplishment
or
the
slow
plodding
of
commonplace
minds
i
must
startle
or
remain
obscure
that
is
why
i
chose
this
place
for
my
venture
and
you
for
my
helper
and
you
want
me
to
ascend
with
you
at
the
end
of
three
days
orlando
i
can
not
you
can
not
not
strong
enough
yet
i
ll
wait
then
three
days
the
time
s
too
short
a
month
is
scarcely
sufficient
it
would
be
folly
such
as
you
never
show
to
trust
a
nerve
so
undermined
as
mine
till
time
has
restored
its
power
for
an
enterprise
like
this
you
need
a
man
of
ready
strength
and
resources
not
one
whose
condition
you
might
be
obliged
to
consider
at
a
very
critical
orlando
balked
thus
at
the
outset
showed
his
displeasure
you
do
not
do
justice
to
your
will
it
is
strong
enough
to
carry
you
through
it
you
can
force
it
to
act
for
i
fear
not
i
counted
on
you
and
you
thwart
me
at
the
most
critical
moment
of
my
oswald
smiled
his
whole
candid
and
generous
nature
bursting
into
view
in
one
quick
flash
perhaps
he
assented
but
you
will
thank
me
when
you
realise
my
weakness
another
man
must
be
found
quick
deft
secret
yet
honourably
alive
to
the
importance
of
the
occasion
and
your
rights
as
a
great
original
thinker
and
do
you
know
such
a
man
i
don
t
but
there
must
be
many
such
among
our
there
isn
t
one
and
i
haven
t
time
to
send
to
brooklyn
i
reckoned
on
can
you
wait
a
month
a
fortnight
then
no
not
ten
oswald
looked
surprised
he
would
like
to
have
asked
why
such
precipitation
was
necessary
but
the
tone
in
which
this
ultimatum
was
given
was
of
that
decisive
character
which
admits
of
no
argument
he
therefore
merely
looked
his
query
but
orlando
was
not
one
to
answer
looks
besides
he
had
no
reply
for
the
same
importunate
question
urged
by
his
own
good
sense
he
knew
that
he
must
make
the
attempt
upon
which
his
future
rested
soon
and
without
risk
of
the
sapping
influence
of
lengthened
suspense
and
weeks
of
waiting
he
could
hold
on
to
those
two
demons
leagued
in
attack
against
him
for
a
definite
seven
days
but
not
for
an
indeterminate
time
if
he
were
to
be
saved
from
folly
from
himself
events
must
rush
he
therefore
repeated
his
no
with
increased
vehemence
adding
as
he
marked
the
reproach
in
his
brother
s
eye
i
can
not
wait
the
test
must
be
made
on
saturday
evening
next
whatever
the
conditions
whatever
the
weather
an
to
be
serviceable
must
be
ready
to
meet
lightning
and
tempest
and
what
is
worse
perhaps
an
insufficient
then
rising
he
exclaimed
with
a
determination
which
rendered
him
majestic
if
help
is
not
forthcoming
i
ll
do
it
all
myself
nothing
shall
hold
me
back
nothing
shall
stop
me
and
when
you
see
me
and
my
car
rise
above
the
treetops
you
ll
feel
that
i
have
done
what
i
could
to
make
you
forget
he
did
not
need
to
continue
oswald
understood
and
flashed
a
grateful
look
his
way
before
saying
you
will
make
the
attempt
at
night
and
on
saturday
i
ve
said
i
will
run
over
in
my
mind
the
qualifications
of
such
men
as
i
know
and
acquaint
you
with
the
result
there
are
adjustments
to
be
made
a
man
of
accuracy
is
i
will
and
he
must
be
likable
i
can
do
nothing
with
a
man
with
whom
i
m
not
perfectly
in
i
understand
a
moment
of
hesitancy
then
i
wish
not
only
yourself
but
miss
scott
to
be
present
at
this
test
prepare
her
for
the
spectacle
but
not
yet
not
till
within
an
hour
or
two
of
the
and
with
a
proud
smile
in
which
flashed
a
significance
which
startled
oswald
he
gave
a
hurried
nod
and
turned
away
when
in
an
hour
afterwards
doris
looked
in
through
the
open
door
she
found
oswald
sitting
with
face
buried
in
his
hands
thinking
so
deeply
that
he
did
not
hear
her
he
had
sat
like
this
immovable
and
absorbed
ever
since
his
brother
had
left
him
xxxv
silence
and
a
knock
oswald
did
not
succeed
in
finding
a
man
to
please
orlando
he
suggested
one
person
after
another
to
the
exacting
inventor
but
none
were
satisfactory
to
him
and
each
in
turn
was
turned
down
it
is
not
every
one
we
want
to
have
share
a
triumph
or
an
ignominious
defeat
and
the
days
were
passing
he
had
said
in
a
moment
of
elation
i
will
do
it
alone
but
he
knew
even
then
that
he
could
not
two
hands
were
necessary
to
start
the
car
afterwards
he
might
manage
it
alone
descent
was
even
possible
but
to
give
the
contrivance
its
first
lift
required
a
second
mechanician
where
was
he
to
find
one
to
please
him
and
what
was
he
to
do
if
he
did
not
conquer
his
prejudices
against
such
men
as
he
had
seen
or
delay
the
attempt
as
oswald
had
suggested
till
he
could
get
one
of
his
old
cronies
on
from
new
york
he
could
do
neither
the
obstinacy
of
his
nature
was
such
as
to
offer
an
invincible
barrier
against
either
suggestion
one
alternative
remained
he
had
heard
of
women
aviators
if
doris
could
be
induced
to
accompany
him
into
the
air
instead
of
clinging
to
the
weight
of
oswald
s
woe
then
would
the
world
behold
a
triumph
which
would
dwarf
the
ecstasy
of
the
bird
s
flight
and
rob
the
eagle
of
his
kingly
pride
but
doris
barely
endured
him
as
yet
and
the
thought
was
not
one
to
be
considered
for
a
moment
yet
what
other
course
remained
he
was
brooding
deeply
on
the
subject
in
his
hangar
one
evening
it
was
thursday
and
saturday
was
but
two
days
off
when
there
came
a
light
knock
at
the
door
this
had
never
occurred
before
he
had
given
strict
orders
backed
by
his
brother
s
authority
that
he
was
never
to
be
intruded
upon
when
in
this
place
and
though
he
had
sometimes
encountered
the
prying
eyes
of
the
curious
flashing
from
behind
the
trees
encircling
the
hangar
his
door
had
never
been
approached
before
or
his
privacy
encroached
upon
he
started
then
when
this
low
but
penetrating
sound
struck
across
the
turmoil
of
his
thoughts
and
cast
one
look
in
the
direction
from
which
it
came
but
he
did
not
rise
or
even
change
his
position
on
his
workman
s
stool
then
it
came
again
still
low
but
with
an
insistence
which
drew
his
brows
together
and
made
his
hand
fall
from
the
wire
he
had
been
unconsciously
holding
through
the
mental
debate
which
was
absorbing
him
still
he
made
no
response
and
the
knocking
continued
should
he
ignore
it
entirely
start
up
his
motor
and
render
himself
oblivious
to
all
other
sounds
at
every
other
point
in
his
career
he
would
have
done
this
but
an
unknown
and
as
yet
unnamed
something
had
entered
his
heart
during
this
fatal
month
which
made
old
ways
impossible
and
oblivion
a
thing
he
dared
not
court
too
recklessly
should
this
be
a
summons
from
doris
should
inconceivable
idea
yet
it
seized
upon
him
relentlessly
and
would
not
yield
for
the
asking
should
it
be
doris
herself
taking
advantage
of
a
momentary
cessation
of
the
ceaseless
tap
tap
he
listened
silence
was
never
profounder
than
in
this
forest
on
that
windless
night
earth
and
air
seemed
to
his
strained
ear
emptied
of
all
sound
the
clatter
of
his
own
steady
unhastened
was
all
that
broke
upon
the
stillness
he
might
be
alone
in
the
universe
for
all
token
of
life
beyond
these
walls
or
so
he
was
saying
to
himself
when
sharp
quick
sinister
the
knocking
recommenced
demanding
admission
insisting
upon
attention
drawing
him
against
his
own
will
to
his
feet
and
finally
though
he
made
more
than
one
stand
against
it
to
the
very
door
who
s
there
he
asked
imperiously
and
with
some
show
of
anger
no
answer
but
another
quiet
knock
speak
or
go
from
my
door
no
one
has
the
right
to
intrude
here
what
is
your
name
and
business
continued
knocking
nothing
more
with
an
outburst
of
wrath
which
made
the
hangar
ring
orlando
lifted
his
fist
to
answer
this
appeal
in
his
own
fierce
fashion
from
his
own
side
of
the
door
but
the
impulse
paused
at
fulfilment
and
he
let
his
arm
fall
again
in
a
rush
of
which
it
would
have
pained
his
worst
enemy
even
little
doris
to
witness
as
it
reached
his
side
the
knock
came
again
it
was
too
much
with
an
oath
orlando
reached
for
his
key
but
before
fitting
it
into
the
lock
he
cast
a
look
behind
him
the
car
was
in
plain
sight
filling
the
central
space
from
floor
to
roof
a
single
glance
from
a
stranger
s
eye
and
its
principal
secret
would
be
a
secret
no
longer
he
must
not
run
such
a
risk
before
he
answered
this
call
he
must
drop
the
curtain
he
had
rigged
up
against
such
emergencies
as
these
he
had
but
to
pull
a
cord
and
a
veil
would
fall
before
his
treasure
concealing
it
as
effectually
as
an
eastern
bride
is
concealed
behind
her
yashmak
stepping
to
the
wall
he
drew
that
cord
then
with
an
impatient
sigh
returned
to
the
door
another
quiet
but
insistent
knock
greeted
him
in
no
fury
now
but
with
a
vague
sense
of
portent
which
gave
an
aspect
of
farewell
to
the
one
quick
glance
he
cast
about
the
spot
he
fitted
the
key
in
the
lock
and
stood
ready
to
turn
it
i
ask
again
your
name
and
your
business
he
shouted
out
in
loud
command
tell
them
or
he
meant
to
say
or
i
do
not
turn
this
but
something
withheld
the
threat
he
knew
that
it
would
perish
in
the
utterance
that
he
could
not
carry
it
out
he
would
have
to
open
the
door
now
response
or
no
response
speak
was
the
word
with
which
he
finished
his
demand
a
final
knock
pulling
a
pistol
from
his
pocket
with
his
left
hand
he
turned
the
key
with
his
right
the
door
remained
unopened
stepping
slowly
back
he
stared
at
its
unpainted
boards
for
a
moment
then
he
spoke
up
quietly
almost
courteously
but
the
command
passed
unheeded
the
latch
was
not
raised
and
only
the
slightest
tap
was
heard
with
a
bound
he
reached
forward
and
pulled
the
door
open
then
a
great
silence
fell
upon
him
and
a
rigidity
as
of
the
grave
seized
and
stiffened
his
powerful
frame
the
man
confronting
him
from
the
darkness
was
sweetwater
xxxvi
the
man
within
and
the
man
without
an
instant
of
silence
during
which
the
two
men
eyed
each
other
then
sweetwater
with
an
ironical
smile
directed
towards
the
pistol
lightly
remarked
mr
challoner
and
other
men
at
the
hotel
are
acquainted
with
my
purpose
and
await
my
return
i
have
come
here
he
cast
a
glowing
look
at
the
huge
curtain
cutting
off
the
greater
portion
of
the
interior
to
offer
you
my
services
brotherson
i
have
no
other
motive
for
this
intrusion
than
to
be
of
use
i
am
deeply
interested
in
your
invention
to
the
development
of
which
i
have
already
lent
some
aid
and
can
bring
to
the
test
you
propose
a
sympathetic
help
which
you
could
hardly
find
in
any
other
person
the
silence
which
settled
down
at
the
completion
of
these
words
had
a
weight
which
made
that
of
the
previous
moment
seem
light
and
all
athrob
with
sound
the
man
within
had
not
yet
caught
his
breath
the
man
without
held
his
in
an
anxiety
which
had
little
to
do
with
the
direction
of
the
weapon
into
which
he
looked
then
an
owl
hooted
far
away
in
the
forest
and
orlando
slowly
lowering
his
arm
asked
in
an
oddly
constrained
tone
how
long
have
you
been
in
town
the
answer
cut
clean
through
any
lingering
hope
he
may
have
had
ever
since
the
day
your
brother
was
told
the
story
of
his
great
ah
still
at
your
old
tricks
i
thought
you
had
quit
that
business
as
i
don
t
know
i
never
expect
quick
returns
he
who
holds
on
for
a
rise
sometimes
reaps
the
arm
and
fist
of
orlando
brotherson
ached
to
hurl
this
fellow
back
into
the
heart
of
the
midnight
woods
but
they
remained
quiescent
and
he
spoke
instead
i
have
buried
the
business
you
will
never
resuscitate
it
through
sweetwater
smiled
there
was
no
mirth
in
his
smile
though
there
was
lightness
in
his
tone
as
said
then
let
us
go
back
to
the
matter
in
hand
you
need
a
helper
where
are
you
going
to
find
one
if
you
don
t
take
me
a
growl
from
brotherson
s
set
lips
never
had
he
looked
more
dangerous
than
in
the
one
burning
instant
following
this
daring
repetition
of
the
detective
s
outrageous
request
but
as
he
noted
how
slight
was
the
figure
opposing
him
from
the
other
side
of
the
threshold
he
was
swayed
by
his
natural
admiration
of
pluck
in
the
physically
weak
and
lost
his
threatening
attitude
only
to
assume
one
which
sweetwater
secretly
found
it
even
harder
to
meet
you
are
a
fool
was
the
stinging
remark
he
heard
flung
at
him
do
you
want
to
play
the
here
and
arrest
me
in
mid
air
mr
brotherson
you
understand
me
as
little
as
i
am
supposed
to
understand
you
humble
as
my
place
is
in
society
and
i
may
add
in
the
department
whose
interests
i
serve
there
are
in
me
two
men
one
you
know
passably
well
the
detective
whose
methods
only
indifferently
clever
show
that
he
has
very
much
to
learn
of
the
other
the
workman
acquainted
with
hammer
and
saw
but
with
some
knowledge
too
of
higher
mathematics
and
the
principles
upon
which
great
mechanical
inventions
depend
you
know
little
and
must
imagine
much
i
was
playing
the
gawky
when
i
helped
you
in
the
old
house
in
brooklyn
i
was
interested
in
your
oh
i
recognised
it
for
what
it
was
notwithstanding
its
oddity
and
lack
of
ostensible
means
for
flying
but
i
was
not
caught
in
the
whirl
of
its
idea
the
idea
by
which
you
doubtless
expect
and
with
very
good
reason
too
to
revolutionise
the
science
of
aviation
but
since
then
i
ve
been
thinking
it
over
and
am
so
filled
with
your
own
hopes
that
either
i
must
have
a
hand
in
the
finishing
and
sailing
of
the
one
you
have
yourself
constructed
or
go
to
work
myself
on
the
hints
you
have
unconsciously
given
me
and
make
a
car
of
my
audacity
often
succeeds
where
subtler
means
fail
orlando
with
a
curious
twist
of
his
strong
lip
took
hold
of
the
detective
s
arm
and
drew
him
in
shutting
and
locking
the
door
carefully
behind
him
now
said
he
you
shall
tell
me
what
you
think
you
have
discovered
to
make
any
ideas
of
your
own
available
in
the
manufacture
of
a
superior
sweetwater
who
had
been
so
violently
wheeled
about
in
entering
that
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
curtain
concealing
the
car
answered
without
hesitation
you
have
a
device
entirely
new
so
far
as
i
can
judge
by
which
this
car
can
leap
at
once
into
space
hold
its
own
in
any
direction
and
alight
again
upon
any
given
spot
without
shock
to
the
machine
or
danger
to
the
people
controlling
explain
the
i
will
draw
you
can
as
i
see
as
you
see
it
yes
it
s
a
brilliant
idea
i
could
never
have
conceived
you
believe
i
sit
here
let
s
see
what
you
sweetwater
sat
down
at
the
table
the
other
pointed
out
and
drawing
forward
a
piece
of
paper
took
up
a
pencil
with
an
easy
air
brotherson
approached
and
stood
at
his
shoulder
he
had
taken
up
his
pistol
again
why
he
hardly
knew
and
as
sweetwater
began
his
marks
his
fingers
tightened
on
its
butt
till
they
turned
white
in
the
murky
lamplight
you
see
came
in
easy
tones
from
the
stooping
draughtsman
i
have
an
imagination
which
only
needs
a
slight
fillip
from
a
mind
like
yours
to
send
it
in
the
desired
direction
i
shall
not
draw
an
exact
reproduction
of
your
idea
but
i
think
you
will
see
that
i
understand
it
very
well
how
s
that
for
a
start
brotherson
looked
and
hastily
drew
back
he
did
not
want
the
other
to
note
his
surprise
but
that
is
a
portion
you
never
saw
he
loudly
declared
no
but
i
saw
this
returned
sweetwater
working
busily
on
some
curves
and
these
gave
me
the
fillip
i
mentioned
the
rest
came
brotherson
in
dread
of
his
own
anger
threw
his
pistol
to
the
other
end
of
the
shed
you
knave
you
thief
he
furiously
cried
how
so
asked
sweetwater
smilingly
rising
and
looking
him
calmly
in
the
face
a
thief
is
one
who
appropriates
another
man
s
goods
or
let
us
say
another
man
s
ideas
i
have
appropriated
nothing
yet
i
ve
only
shown
you
how
easily
i
could
do
so
brotherson
take
me
in
as
your
assistant
i
will
be
faithful
to
you
i
swear
it
i
want
to
see
that
machine
go
for
how
many
people
have
you
drawn
those
lines
thundered
the
inexorable
voice
for
nobody
not
for
myself
even
this
is
the
first
time
they
have
left
their
in
my
can
you
swear
to
that
i
can
and
will
if
you
require
it
but
you
ought
to
believe
my
word
sir
i
am
square
as
a
die
in
all
matters
not
connected
well
not
connected
with
my
profession
he
smiled
in
a
burst
of
that
whimsical
humour
which
not
even
the
seriousness
of
the
moment
could
quite
suppress
and
what
surety
have
i
that
you
do
not
consider
this
very
matter
of
mine
as
coming
within
the
bounds
you
speak
of
none
but
you
must
trust
me
that
brotherson
surveyed
him
with
an
irony
which
conveyed
a
very
different
message
to
the
detective
than
any
he
had
intended
then
quickly
to
how
many
have
you
spoken
dilating
upon
this
device
and
publishing
abroad
my
secret
i
have
spoken
to
no
one
not
even
to
gryce
that
shows
my
honesty
as
nothing
else
you
have
kept
my
secret
intact
entirely
so
so
that
no
one
here
or
elsewhere
shares
our
knowledge
of
the
new
points
in
this
mechanism
i
say
so
then
if
i
should
kill
you
came
in
ferocious
accents
now
here
you
would
be
the
only
one
to
own
that
knowledge
but
you
won
t
kill
why
need
i
go
into
reasons
why
i
because
your
conscience
is
already
too
heavily
laden
to
bear
the
burden
of
another
unprovoked
brotherson
starting
back
glared
with
open
ferocity
upon
the
man
who
dared
to
face
him
with
such
an
accusation
god
why
didn
t
i
shoot
you
on
entrance
he
cried
your
courage
is
certainly
a
fine
smile
without
even
the
hint
of
humour
now
touched
the
daring
detective
s
lip
brotherson
s
anger
seemed
to
grow
under
it
and
he
loudly
repeated
it
s
more
than
colossal
it
s
abnormal
and
a
moment
s
pause
then
with
ironic
pauses
and
quite
unnecessary
save
as
a
matter
of
display
unless
you
think
you
need
it
to
sustain
you
through
the
ordeal
you
are
courting
you
wish
to
help
me
finish
and
prepare
for
flight
i
sincerely
you
consider
yourself
competent
i
brotherson
s
eyes
fell
and
he
walked
once
to
the
extremity
of
the
oval
flooring
and
back
well
we
will
grant
that
but
that
s
not
all
that
is
necessary
my
requirements
demand
a
companion
in
my
first
flight
will
you
go
up
in
the
car
with
me
on
saturday
night
a
quick
affirmative
was
on
sweetwater
s
lips
but
the
glimpse
which
he
got
of
the
speaker
s
face
glowering
upon
him
from
the
shadows
into
which
brotherson
had
withdrawn
stopped
its
utterance
and
the
silence
grew
heavy
though
it
may
not
have
lasted
long
by
the
clock
the
instant
of
breathless
contemplation
of
each
other
s
features
across
the
intervening
space
was
of
incalculable
moment
to
sweetwater
and
possibly
to
brotherson
as
drowning
men
are
said
to
live
over
their
whole
history
between
their
first
plunge
and
their
final
rise
to
light
and
air
so
through
the
mind
of
the
detective
rushed
the
memories
of
his
past
and
the
fast
fading
glories
of
his
future
and
rebelling
at
the
subtle
peril
he
saw
in
that
sardonic
eye
he
vociferated
an
impulsive
no
i
ll
not
and
paused
caught
by
a
new
and
irresistible
sensation
a
breath
of
wind
the
first
he
had
felt
that
night
had
swept
in
through
some
crevice
in
the
curving
wall
flapping
the
canvas
enveloping
the
great
car
it
acted
like
a
peal
to
battle
after
all
a
man
must
take
some
risks
in
his
life
and
his
heart
was
in
this
trial
of
a
redoubtable
mechanism
in
which
he
had
full
faith
he
could
not
say
no
to
the
prospect
of
being
the
first
to
share
a
triumph
which
would
send
his
name
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
changing
the
trend
of
his
sentence
he
repeated
with
a
calmness
which
had
the
force
of
a
great
decision
i
will
not
fail
you
in
anything
if
she
rises
here
his
trembling
hand
fell
on
the
curtain
shutting
off
his
view
of
the
ship
she
shall
take
me
with
her
so
that
when
she
descends
i
may
be
the
first
to
congratulate
the
proud
inventor
of
such
a
so
be
it
shot
from
the
other
s
lips
his
eyes
losing
their
threatening
look
and
his
whole
countenance
suddenly
aglow
with
the
enthusiasm
of
awakened
genius
coming
from
the
shadows
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
cord
regulating
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
concealing
curtain
here
she
is
he
cried
and
drew
the
cord
the
canvas
shook
gathered
itself
into
great
folds
and
disappeared
in
the
shadows
from
which
he
had
just
stepped
the
stood
revealed
a
startling
because
wholly
unique
vision
long
did
sweetwater
survey
it
then
turning
with
beaming
face
upon
the
watchful
inventor
he
uttered
a
loud
hurrah
next
moment
with
everything
forgotten
between
them
save
the
glories
of
this
invention
both
dropped
simultaneously
to
the
floor
and
began
that
minute
examination
of
the
mechanism
necessary
to
their
mutual
work
xxxvii
his
great
hour
saturday
night
at
eight
o
clock
so
the
fiat
had
gone
forth
with
no
concession
to
be
made
on
account
of
weather
as
oswald
came
from
his
supper
and
took
a
look
at
the
heavens
from
the
small
front
porch
he
was
deeply
troubled
that
orlando
had
remained
so
obstinate
on
this
point
for
there
were
ominous
clouds
rolling
up
from
the
east
and
the
storms
in
this
region
of
high
mountains
and
abrupt
valleys
were
not
light
nor
without
danger
even
to
those
with
feet
well
planted
upon
mother
earth
if
the
tempest
should
come
up
before
eight
challoner
who
from
some
mysterious
impulse
of
bravado
on
the
part
of
brotherson
was
to
be
allowed
to
make
the
third
in
this
small
band
of
spectators
was
equally
concerned
at
this
sight
but
not
for
brotherson
his
fears
were
for
oswald
whose
slowly
gathering
strength
could
illy
bear
the
strain
which
this
additional
anxiety
for
his
brother
s
life
must
impose
upon
him
as
for
doris
she
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
more
connected
with
the
past
than
with
the
future
that
afternoon
she
had
laid
her
hand
in
that
of
orlando
brotherson
and
wished
him
well
she
in
whose
breast
still
lingered
reminiscences
of
those
old
doubts
which
had
beclouded
his
image
for
her
at
their
first
meeting
she
had
not
been
able
to
avoid
it
his
look
was
a
compelling
one
and
it
had
demanded
thus
much
from
her
and
a
terrible
thought
to
her
gentle
spirit
he
might
be
going
to
his
death
it
had
been
settled
by
the
prospective
aviator
that
they
were
to
watch
for
the
ascent
from
the
mouth
of
the
grassy
road
leading
in
to
the
hangar
the
three
were
to
meet
there
at
a
quarter
to
eight
and
await
the
stroke
and
the
rise
that
time
was
near
and
challoner
catching
a
glimpse
of
oswald
s
pallid
and
unnaturally
drawn
features
as
he
set
down
the
lantern
he
carried
shuddered
with
foreboding
and
wished
the
hour
passed
doris
watchful
glance
never
left
the
face
whose
lightest
change
was
more
to
her
than
all
orlando
s
hopes
but
the
result
upon
her
was
not
to
weaken
her
resolution
but
to
strengthen
it
whatever
the
outcome
of
the
next
few
minutes
she
must
stand
ready
to
sustain
her
invalid
through
it
that
the
darkness
of
early
evening
had
deepened
to
oppression
was
unnoticed
for
the
moment
the
fears
of
an
hour
past
had
been
forgotten
their
attention
was
too
absorbed
in
what
was
going
on
before
them
for
even
a
glance
overhead
suddenly
challoner
spoke
who
is
the
man
whom
brotherson
has
asked
to
go
up
with
him
it
was
oswald
who
answered
he
has
never
told
me
he
has
kept
his
own
counsel
about
that
as
about
everything
else
connected
with
this
matter
he
simply
advised
me
that
i
was
not
to
bother
about
him
any
more
that
he
had
found
the
assistant
he
such
reticence
seems
unpardonable
you
have
displayed
great
patience
because
i
understand
orlando
he
reads
men
s
natures
like
a
book
the
man
he
trusts
we
may
trust
he
will
speak
openly
enough
all
cause
for
reticence
will
be
you
have
confidence
then
in
the
success
of
this
undertaking
if
i
hadn
t
i
should
not
be
here
i
could
hardly
bear
to
witness
his
failure
even
in
a
secret
test
like
this
i
should
find
it
too
hard
to
face
him
i
don
t
orlando
has
great
pride
if
this
enterprise
fails
i
can
not
answer
for
him
he
would
be
capable
of
anything
why
doris
what
is
the
matter
child
i
never
saw
you
look
like
that
she
had
been
down
on
her
knees
regulating
the
lantern
and
the
sudden
flame
shooting
up
had
shown
him
her
face
turned
up
towards
his
in
an
apprehension
which
verged
on
horror
do
i
look
frightened
she
asked
remembering
herself
and
lightly
rising
i
believe
that
i
am
a
little
frightened
if
if
anything
should
go
wrong
if
an
but
here
she
remembered
herself
again
and
quickly
changed
her
tone
but
your
confidence
shall
be
mine
i
will
believe
in
his
good
angel
or
or
in
his
and
great
resolution
i
ll
not
be
frightened
any
but
oswald
did
not
seem
satisfied
he
continued
to
look
at
her
in
vague
concern
he
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
the
intense
feeling
she
had
manifested
had
orlando
touched
her
girlish
heart
had
this
nature
with
its
brilliancy
and
honourable
but
stern
views
of
life
moved
this
warm
and
sympathetic
soul
to
more
than
admiration
the
thought
disturbed
him
so
he
forgot
the
nearness
of
the
moment
they
were
all
awaiting
till
a
quick
rasping
sound
from
the
hangar
followed
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
an
band
of
light
about
its
upper
rim
drew
his
attention
and
awakened
them
all
to
a
breathless
expectation
the
lid
was
rising
now
it
was
up
and
now
for
the
first
time
it
was
lifted
to
its
full
height
and
stood
a
broad
oval
disc
against
the
background
of
the
forest
the
effect
was
strange
the
hangar
had
been
made
brilliant
by
many
lamps
and
their
united
glare
pouring
from
its
top
and
illuminating
not
only
the
surrounding
treetops
but
the
broad
face
of
this
uplifted
disc
roused
in
the
awed
spectator
a
thrill
such
as
in
mythological
times
might
have
greeted
the
sudden
sight
of
vulcan
s
smithy
blazing
on
olympian
hills
but
the
clang
of
iron
on
iron
would
have
attended
the
flash
and
gleam
of
those
unexpected
fires
and
here
all
was
still
save
for
that
steady
throb
never
heard
in
olympus
or
the
halls
of
valhalla
the
pant
of
the
motor
eager
for
flight
in
the
upper
air
as
they
listened
in
a
trance
of
burning
hope
which
obliterated
all
else
this
noise
and
all
others
near
and
distant
was
suddenly
lost
in
a
loud
clatter
of
writhing
and
twisting
boughs
which
set
the
forest
in
a
roar
and
seemed
to
heave
the
air
about
them
a
wind
had
swooped
down
from
the
east
bending
everything
before
it
and
rattling
the
huge
oval
on
which
their
eyes
were
fixed
as
though
it
would
tear
it
from
its
hinges
the
three
caught
at
each
other
s
hands
in
dismay
the
storm
had
come
just
on
the
verge
of
the
enterprise
and
no
one
might
guess
the
result
will
he
dare
will
he
dare
whispered
doris
and
oswald
answered
though
it
seemed
next
to
impossible
that
he
could
have
heard
her
he
will
dare
but
will
he
survive
it
challoner
he
suddenly
shouted
in
that
gentleman
s
ear
what
time
is
it
now
challoner
disengaging
himself
from
their
mutual
grasp
knelt
down
by
the
lantern
to
consult
his
watch
one
minute
to
eight
he
shouted
back
the
forest
was
now
a
pandemonium
great
boughs
split
from
their
parent
trunks
fell
crashing
to
the
ground
in
all
directions
the
scream
of
the
wind
roused
echoes
which
repeated
themselves
here
there
and
everywhere
no
rain
had
fallen
yet
but
the
sight
of
the
clouds
skurrying
through
the
glare
thrown
up
from
the
shed
created
such
havoc
in
the
already
overstrained
minds
of
the
three
onlookers
that
they
hardly
heeded
when
with
a
clatter
and
crash
which
at
another
time
would
have
startled
them
into
flight
the
swaying
oval
before
them
was
whirled
from
its
hinges
and
thrown
back
against
the
trees
already
bending
under
the
onslaught
of
the
tempest
destruction
seemed
the
natural
accompaniment
of
the
moment
and
the
only
prayer
which
sprang
to
oswald
s
lips
was
that
the
motor
whose
throb
yet
lingered
in
their
blood
though
no
longer
taken
in
by
the
ear
would
either
refuse
to
work
or
prove
insufficient
to
lift
the
heavy
car
into
this
seething
tumult
of
warring
forces
his
brother
s
life
hung
in
the
balance
against
his
fame
and
he
could
not
but
choose
life
for
him
yet
as
the
multitudinous
sounds
about
him
yielded
for
a
moment
to
that
brother
s
shout
and
he
knew
that
the
moment
had
come
which
would
soon
settle
all
he
found
himself
staring
at
the
elliptical
edge
of
the
hangar
with
an
anticipation
which
held
in
it
as
much
terror
as
joy
for
the
end
of
a
great
hope
or
the
beginning
of
a
great
triumph
was
compressed
into
this
trembling
instant
and
if
great
god
he
sees
it
they
all
see
it
plainly
against
that
portion
of
the
disc
which
still
lifted
itself
above
the
further
wall
a
curious
moving
mass
appears
lengthens
takes
on
shape
then
shoots
suddenly
aloft
clearing
the
encircling
tops
of
the
bending
twisting
and
tormented
trees
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
gale
where
for
one
breathless
moment
it
whirls
madly
about
like
a
thing
distraught
then
in
slow
but
triumphant
obedience
to
the
master
hand
that
guides
it
steadies
and
mounts
majestically
upward
till
it
is
lost
to
their
view
in
the
depths
of
impenetrable
darkness
orlando
brotherson
has
accomplished
his
task
he
has
invented
a
mechanism
which
can
send
an
straight
up
from
its
mooring
place
as
the
three
watchers
realise
this
oswald
utters
a
cry
of
triumph
and
doris
throws
herself
into
challoner
s
arms
then
they
all
stand
transfixed
again
waiting
for
a
descent
which
may
never
come
but
hark
a
new
sound
mingling
its
clatter
with
all
the
others
it
is
the
rain
quick
maddening
drenching
it
comes
enveloping
them
in
wet
in
a
moment
can
they
hold
their
faces
up
against
it
and
the
wind
surely
it
must
toss
that
aerial
messenger
before
it
and
fling
it
back
to
earth
a
broken
and
despised
toy
orlando
went
up
in
a
shriek
orlando
oh
for
a
ray
of
light
in
those
heavens
for
a
lull
in
the
tremendous
sounds
shivering
the
heavens
and
shaking
the
earth
but
the
tempest
rages
on
and
they
can
only
wait
five
minutes
ten
minutes
looking
hoping
fearing
without
thought
of
self
and
almost
without
thought
of
each
other
till
suddenly
as
it
had
come
the
rain
ceases
and
the
wind
with
one
final
wail
of
rage
and
defeat
rushes
away
into
the
west
leaving
behind
it
a
sudden
silence
which
to
their
terrified
hearts
seems
almost
more
dreadful
to
bear
than
the
accumulated
noises
of
the
moment
just
gone
orlando
was
in
that
shout
of
natural
forces
but
he
is
not
in
this
stillness
they
look
aloft
but
the
heavens
are
void
emptiness
is
where
life
was
oswald
begins
to
sway
and
doris
remembering
him
now
and
him
only
has
thrown
her
strong
young
arm
about
him
when
what
is
this
sound
they
hear
high
up
high
up
in
the
rapidly
clearing
vault
of
the
heavens
a
throb
a
steady
pant
drawing
near
and
yet
nearer
entering
the
circlet
of
great
branches
over
their
heads
descending
slowly
descending
till
they
catch
another
glimpse
of
those
hazy
outlines
which
had
no
sooner
taken
shape
than
the
car
disappeared
from
their
sight
within
the
elliptical
wall
open
to
receive
it
it
had
survived
the
gale
it
has
its
haven
and
that
too
without
colliding
with
aught
around
or
any
shock
to
those
within
just
as
orlando
had
promised
and
the
world
was
henceforth
his
hail
to
orlando
brotherson
oswald
could
hardly
restrain
his
mad
joy
and
enthusiasm
bounding
to
the
door
separating
him
from
this
conqueror
of
almost
invincible
forces
he
pounded
it
with
impatient
fist
let
me
in
he
cried
you
ve
done
the
trick
orlando
you
ve
done
the
yes
i
have
satisfied
myself
came
back
in
studied
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
with
a
quick
turning
of
the
lock
orlando
stood
before
them
they
never
forgot
him
as
he
looked
at
that
moment
he
was
drenched
battered
palpitating
with
excitement
but
the
majesty
of
success
was
in
his
eye
and
in
the
bearing
of
his
incomparable
figure
as
oswald
bounded
towards
him
he
reached
out
his
hand
but
his
glance
was
for
doris
yes
he
went
on
in
tones
of
suppressed
elation
there
s
no
flaw
in
my
triumph
i
have
done
all
that
i
set
out
to
do
now
why
did
he
stop
and
look
hurriedly
back
into
the
hangar
he
had
remembered
sweetwater
sweetwater
who
at
that
moment
was
stepping
carefully
from
his
seat
in
some
remote
portion
of
the
car
the
triumph
was
not
complete
he
had
meant
but
there
his
thought
stopped
nothing
of
evil
nothing
even
of
regret
should
mar
his
great
hour
he
was
a
conqueror
and
it
was
for
him
now
to
reap
the
joy
of
conquest
xxxviii
night
three
days
had
passed
and
orlando
brotherson
sat
in
his
room
at
the
hotel
before
a
table
laden
with
telegrams
letters
and
marked
newspapers
the
news
of
his
achievement
had
gone
abroad
and
derby
was
for
the
moment
the
centre
of
interest
for
two
continents
his
success
was
an
established
fact
the
second
trial
which
he
had
made
with
his
car
this
time
with
the
whole
town
gathered
together
in
the
streets
as
witnesses
had
proved
not
only
the
reliability
of
its
mechanism
but
the
great
advantages
which
it
possessed
for
a
direct
flight
to
any
given
point
already
he
saw
fortune
beckoning
to
him
in
the
shape
of
an
unconditional
offer
of
money
from
a
source
and
better
still
for
he
was
a
man
of
untiring
energy
and
boundless
resource
that
opportunity
for
new
and
enlarged
effort
which
comes
with
the
recognition
of
one
s
exceptional
powers
all
this
was
his
and
more
a
sweeter
hope
a
more
enduring
joy
had
followed
hard
upon
gratified
ambition
doris
had
smiled
on
him
doris
she
had
caught
the
contagion
of
the
universal
enthusiasm
and
had
given
him
her
first
ungrudging
token
of
approval
it
had
altered
his
whole
outlook
on
life
in
an
instant
for
there
was
an
eagerness
in
this
demonstration
which
proclaimed
the
relieved
heart
she
no
longer
trusted
either
appearances
or
her
dream
he
had
succeeded
in
conquering
her
doubts
by
the
very
force
of
his
personality
and
the
shadow
which
had
hitherto
darkened
their
intercourse
had
melted
quite
away
she
was
ready
to
take
his
word
now
and
oswald
s
after
which
the
rest
must
follow
love
does
not
lag
far
behind
an
ardent
admiration
fame
fortune
love
what
more
could
a
man
desire
what
more
could
this
man
with
his
strenuous
past
and
an
unlimited
capacity
for
an
enlarged
future
ask
from
fate
than
this
yet
as
he
bends
over
his
letters
fingering
some
but
reading
none
beyond
a
line
or
two
he
betrays
but
a
passing
elation
and
hardly
lifts
his
head
when
a
burst
of
loud
acclaim
comes
ringing
up
to
his
window
from
some
ardent
hurrah
for
brotherson
he
has
put
our
town
on
the
map
why
this
despondency
have
those
two
demons
seized
him
again
it
would
seem
so
and
with
new
and
overmastering
fury
after
the
hour
of
triumph
comes
the
hour
of
reckoning
orlando
brotherson
in
his
hour
of
proud
attainment
stands
naked
before
his
own
soul
s
tribunal
and
the
pleader
is
dumb
and
the
judge
inexorable
there
is
but
one
witness
to
such
struggles
but
one
eye
to
note
the
waste
and
desolation
of
the
devastated
soul
when
the
storm
is
over
past
orlando
brotherson
has
succumbed
the
attack
was
too
keen
his
forces
too
shaken
but
as
the
heavy
minutes
pass
he
slowly
his
strength
and
rises
in
the
end
a
conqueror
nevertheless
he
knows
even
in
that
moment
of
regained
command
that
the
peace
he
had
thus
bought
with
strain
and
stress
is
but
momentary
that
the
battle
is
on
for
life
that
the
days
which
to
other
eyes
would
carry
a
sense
of
brilliancy
days
teeming
with
work
and
outward
satisfaction
would
hold
within
their
hidden
depths
a
brooding
uncertainty
which
would
rob
applause
of
its
music
and
even
overshadow
the
angel
face
of
love
he
quailed
at
the
prospect
materialist
though
he
was
the
days
the
interminable
days
in
his
unbroken
strength
and
the
glare
of
the
noonday
sun
he
forgot
to
take
account
of
the
nights
looming
in
black
and
endless
procession
before
him
it
was
from
the
day
phantom
he
shrank
and
not
from
the
ghoul
which
works
in
the
darkness
and
makes
a
grave
of
the
heart
while
happier
mortals
sleep
and
the
former
terror
seemed
formidable
enough
to
him
in
this
his
hour
of
startling
realisation
even
if
he
had
freed
himself
for
the
nonce
from
its
controlling
power
to
escape
all
further
contemplation
of
it
he
would
work
these
letters
deserved
attention
he
would
carry
them
to
oswald
and
in
their
consideration
find
distraction
for
the
rest
of
the
day
at
least
oswald
was
a
good
fellow
if
pleasure
were
to
be
gotten
from
these
tokens
of
he
should
have
his
share
of
it
a
gleam
of
oswald
s
old
spirit
in
oswald
s
once
bright
eye
would
go
far
towards
throttling
one
of
those
demons
whose
talons
he
had
just
released
from
his
throat
and
if
doris
responded
too
he
would
deserve
his
fate
if
he
did
not
succeed
in
gaining
that
mastery
of
himself
which
would
make
such
hours
as
these
but
episodes
in
a
life
big
with
interest
and
potent
with
great
emotions
rising
with
a
resolute
air
he
made
a
bundle
of
his
papers
and
with
them
in
hand
passed
out
of
his
room
and
down
the
hotel
stairs
a
man
stood
directly
in
his
way
as
he
made
for
the
front
door
it
was
challoner
courtesy
demanded
some
show
of
recognition
between
them
and
brotherson
was
passing
with
his
usual
cold
bow
when
a
sudden
impulse
led
him
to
pause
and
meet
the
other
s
eye
with
the
sarcastic
remark
you
have
expressed
or
so
i
have
been
told
some
surprise
at
my
choice
of
mechanician
a
man
of
varied
accomplishments
challoner
but
one
for
whom
i
have
no
further
use
if
therefore
you
wish
to
call
off
your
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
so
i
hardly
think
he
can
be
serviceable
to
either
of
us
much
the
older
gentleman
hesitated
seeking
possibly
for
composure
and
when
he
answered
it
was
not
only
without
irony
but
with
a
certain
forced
respect
mr
sweetwater
has
just
left
for
new
york
brotherson
he
will
carry
with
him
no
doubt
the
full
particulars
of
your
great
orlando
bowed
this
time
with
distinguished
grace
not
a
flicker
of
relief
had
disturbed
the
calm
serenity
of
his
aspect
yet
when
a
moment
later
he
stepped
among
his
shouting
admirers
in
the
street
his
air
and
glance
betrayed
a
bounding
joy
for
which
another
source
must
be
found
than
that
of
gratified
pride
a
chain
had
slipped
from
his
spirit
and
though
the
people
shrank
a
little
even
while
they
cheered
it
was
rather
from
awe
of
his
bearing
and
the
recognition
of
that
sense
of
apartness
which
underlay
his
smile
than
from
any
perception
of
the
man
s
real
nature
or
of
the
awesome
purpose
which
at
that
moment
exalted
it
but
had
they
known
could
they
have
seen
into
this
tumultuous
heart
what
a
silence
would
have
settled
upon
these
noisy
streets
and
in
what
terror
and
would
each
man
have
slunk
away
from
his
fellows
into
the
quiet
and
solitude
of
his
own
home
brotherson
himself
was
not
without
a
sense
of
the
incongruity
underlying
this
ovation
for
as
he
slowly
worked
himself
along
the
brightness
of
his
look
became
dimmed
with
a
tinge
of
sarcasm
which
in
its
turn
gave
way
to
an
expression
of
extreme
melancholy
both
quite
unbefitting
the
hero
of
the
hour
in
the
first
flush
of
his
glory
had
he
seen
doris
youthful
figure
emerge
for
a
moment
from
the
porch
he
was
approaching
bringing
with
it
some
doubt
of
the
reception
awaiting
him
possibly
for
he
made
a
stand
before
he
reached
the
house
and
sent
his
followers
back
after
which
he
advanced
with
an
unhurrying
step
so
that
several
minutes
elapsed
before
he
finally
drew
up
before
scott
s
door
and
entered
through
the
now
empty
porch
into
his
brother
s
he
had
meant
to
see
doris
first
but
his
mind
had
changed
if
all
passed
off
well
between
himself
and
oswald
if
he
found
his
brother
responsive
and
to
the
interests
and
necessities
of
the
hour
he
might
forego
his
interview
with
her
till
he
felt
better
prepared
to
meet
it
for
call
it
cowardice
or
simply
a
reasonable
precaution
any
delay
seemed
preferable
to
him
in
his
present
mood
of
discouragement
to
that
final
casting
of
the
die
upon
which
hung
so
many
and
such
tremendous
issues
it
was
the
first
moment
of
real
halt
in
his
whole
tumultuous
life
never
as
daring
experimentalist
or
agitator
had
he
shrunk
from
danger
seen
or
unseen
or
from
threat
uttered
or
unuttered
as
he
shrank
from
this
young
girl
s
no
and
something
of
the
dread
he
had
felt
lest
he
should
encounter
her
unaware
in
the
hall
and
so
be
led
on
to
speak
when
his
own
judgment
bade
him
be
silent
darkened
his
features
as
he
entered
his
brother
s
presence
but
oswald
was
sunk
in
a
bitter
revery
of
his
own
and
took
no
heed
of
these
signs
of
depression
in
the
following
these
days
of
great
excitement
the
past
had
itself
and
all
was
gloom
in
his
once
generous
soul
this
orlando
had
time
to
perceive
quick
as
the
change
came
when
his
brother
really
realised
who
his
visitor
was
the
glad
orlando
and
the
forced
smile
did
not
deceive
him
and
his
voice
quavered
a
trifle
as
he
held
out
his
packet
with
the
words
i
have
come
to
show
you
what
the
world
says
of
my
invention
we
will
soon
be
great
men
he
emphasised
as
oswald
opened
the
letters
money
has
been
offered
me
and
read
read
he
urged
with
an
unconscious
dictatorialness
as
oswald
paused
in
his
task
see
what
the
fates
have
prepared
for
us
for
you
shall
share
all
my
honours
as
you
will
from
this
day
share
my
work
and
enter
into
all
my
experiments
can
not
you
enthuse
a
little
bit
over
it
doesn
t
the
prospect
contain
any
allurement
for
you
would
you
rather
stay
locked
up
in
this
petty
town
yes
or
die
don
t
look
like
that
orlando
it
was
a
cowardly
speech
and
i
ask
your
pardon
i
m
hardly
fit
to
talk
edith
orlando
frowned
not
that
name
he
harshly
interrupted
you
must
not
hamper
your
life
with
useless
memories
that
dream
of
yours
may
be
sacred
but
it
belongs
to
the
past
and
a
great
reality
confronts
you
when
you
have
fully
recovered
your
health
your
own
manhood
will
rebel
at
a
weakness
unworthy
one
of
our
name
rouse
yourself
oswald
take
account
of
our
prospects
give
me
your
hand
and
say
life
holds
something
for
me
yet
i
have
a
brother
who
needs
me
if
i
do
not
need
him
together
we
can
prove
ourselves
invincible
and
wrench
fame
and
fortune
from
the
but
the
hand
he
reached
for
did
not
rise
at
his
command
though
oswald
started
erect
and
faced
him
with
manly
earnestness
i
should
have
to
think
long
and
deeply
he
said
before
i
took
upon
myself
responsibilities
like
these
i
am
broken
in
mind
and
heart
orlando
and
must
remain
so
till
god
mercifully
delivers
me
i
should
be
a
poor
assistant
to
you
a
drag
rather
than
a
help
deeply
as
i
deplore
it
hard
as
it
may
be
for
one
of
your
temperament
to
understand
so
complete
an
overthrow
i
yet
must
acknowledge
my
condition
and
pray
you
not
to
count
upon
me
in
any
plans
you
may
form
i
know
how
this
looks
i
know
that
as
your
brother
and
truest
admirer
i
should
respond
and
respond
strongly
to
such
overtures
as
these
but
the
motive
for
achievement
is
gone
she
was
my
all
and
while
i
might
work
it
would
be
mechanically
the
lift
the
elevating
thought
is
orlando
stood
a
moment
studying
his
brother
s
face
then
he
turned
shortly
about
and
walked
the
length
of
the
room
when
he
came
back
he
took
up
his
stand
again
directly
before
oswald
and
asked
with
a
new
note
in
his
voice
did
you
love
edith
challoner
so
much
as
that
a
glance
from
oswald
s
eye
sadder
than
any
tear
so
that
you
can
not
be
reconciled
a
gesture
oswald
s
words
were
always
few
orlando
s
frown
deepened
such
grief
i
partly
understand
said
he
but
time
will
cure
it
some
day
another
lovely
face
we
ll
not
talk
of
that
no
we
ll
not
talk
of
that
acquiesced
the
inventor
walking
away
again
this
time
to
the
window
for
you
there
s
but
one
woman
and
she
s
a
killed
broke
from
his
brother
s
lips
slain
by
her
own
hand
under
an
impulse
of
wildness
and
terror
can
i
ever
forget
that
do
not
expect
it
then
you
do
blame
me
orlando
turned
and
was
looking
full
at
oswald
i
blame
your
unreasonableness
and
your
overweening
orlando
stood
a
moment
then
moved
towards
the
door
the
heaviness
of
his
step
smote
upon
oswald
s
ear
and
caused
him
to
exclaim
forgive
me
but
the
other
cut
him
short
with
an
imperative
thanks
for
your
candour
if
her
spirit
is
destined
to
stand
like
an
immovable
shadow
between
you
and
me
you
do
right
to
warn
me
but
this
interview
must
end
all
allusion
to
the
subject
i
will
seek
and
find
another
man
to
share
my
fortunes
as
he
said
this
he
approached
suddenly
and
took
his
papers
from
the
other
s
hand
or
here
he
hastily
retraced
his
steps
to
the
door
which
he
softly
opened
or
he
repeated
but
though
oswald
listened
for
the
rest
it
did
not
come
while
he
waited
the
other
had
given
him
one
deeply
concentrated
look
and
passed
out
no
heartfelt
understanding
was
possible
between
these
two
men
crossing
the
hall
orlando
knocked
at
the
door
of
doris
little
no
answer
yet
she
was
there
he
knew
it
in
every
throbbing
fibre
of
his
body
she
was
there
and
quite
aware
of
his
presence
of
this
he
felt
sure
yet
she
did
not
bid
him
enter
should
he
knock
again
never
but
he
would
not
quit
the
threshold
not
if
she
kept
him
waiting
there
for
hours
perhaps
she
realised
this
perhaps
she
had
meant
to
open
the
door
to
him
from
the
very
first
who
can
tell
what
avails
is
that
she
did
ultimately
open
it
and
he
meeting
her
soft
eye
wished
from
his
very
heart
that
his
impulse
had
led
him
another
way
even
if
that
way
had
been
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
over
for
the
face
he
looked
upon
was
serene
and
there
was
no
serenity
in
him
rather
a
confusion
of
unloosed
passions
fearful
of
barrier
and
yearning
tumultuously
for
freedom
but
whatever
his
revolt
the
secret
revolt
which
makes
no
show
in
look
or
movement
he
kept
his
ground
and
forced
a
smile
of
greeting
if
her
face
was
quiet
it
was
also
lovely
too
lovely
he
felt
for
a
man
to
leave
it
whatever
might
come
of
his
lingering
nothing
in
all
his
life
had
ever
affected
him
like
it
for
him
there
was
no
other
woman
in
the
past
the
present
or
the
future
and
realising
this
taking
in
to
the
full
what
her
affection
and
her
trust
might
be
to
him
in
those
fearsome
days
to
come
he
so
dreaded
a
rebuff
he
who
had
been
the
courted
of
women
and
the
admired
of
men
ever
since
he
could
remember
that
he
failed
to
respond
to
her
welcome
and
the
simple
congratulations
she
felt
forced
to
repeat
he
could
neither
speak
the
commonplace
nor
listen
to
it
this
was
his
crucial
hour
he
must
find
support
here
or
yield
hopelessly
to
the
maelstrom
in
whose
whirl
he
was
caught
she
saw
his
excitement
and
faltered
back
a
step
a
move
which
she
regretted
the
next
minute
for
he
took
advantage
of
it
to
enter
and
close
behind
him
the
door
which
she
would
never
have
shut
of
her
own
accord
then
he
spoke
abruptly
passionately
but
in
those
golden
tones
which
no
emotion
could
render
other
than
alluring
i
am
an
unhappy
man
miss
scott
i
see
that
my
presence
here
is
not
welcome
yet
am
sure
that
it
would
be
so
if
it
were
not
for
a
prejudice
which
your
generous
nature
should
be
the
first
to
cast
aside
in
face
of
the
outspoken
confidence
of
my
brother
oswald
doris
little
doris
i
love
you
i
have
loved
you
from
the
moment
of
our
first
meeting
not
to
many
men
is
it
given
to
find
his
heart
so
late
and
when
he
does
it
is
for
his
whole
life
no
second
passion
can
follow
it
i
know
that
i
am
premature
in
saying
this
that
you
are
not
prepared
to
hear
such
words
from
me
and
that
it
might
be
wiser
for
me
to
withhold
them
but
i
must
leave
derby
soon
and
i
can
not
go
until
i
know
whether
there
is
the
least
hope
that
you
will
yet
lend
a
light
to
my
career
or
whether
that
career
must
burn
itself
to
ashes
at
your
feet
oswald
nay
hear
me
out
oswald
lives
in
his
memories
but
i
must
have
an
active
hope
a
tangible
expectation
if
i
am
to
be
the
man
i
was
meant
to
be
will
you
then
coldly
dismiss
me
or
will
you
let
my
whole
future
life
prove
to
you
the
innocence
of
my
past
i
will
not
hasten
anything
all
i
ask
is
some
indulgence
time
will
do
the
impossible
she
murmured
but
that
was
a
word
for
which
he
had
no
ear
he
saw
that
she
was
moved
unexpectedly
so
that
while
her
eyes
wandered
restlessly
at
times
towards
the
door
they
ever
came
back
in
girlish
wonder
if
not
fascination
to
his
face
emboldening
him
so
that
he
ventured
at
last
to
add
doris
little
doris
i
will
teach
you
a
marvellous
lesson
if
you
will
only
turn
your
dainty
ear
my
way
love
such
as
mine
carries
infinite
treasure
with
it
will
you
have
that
treasure
heaped
piled
before
your
feet
your
lips
say
no
but
your
eyes
the
truest
eyes
i
ever
saw
whisper
a
different
language
the
day
will
come
when
you
will
find
your
joy
in
the
breast
of
him
you
are
now
afraid
to
and
not
waiting
for
disclaimer
or
even
a
glance
of
reproach
from
the
eyes
he
had
so
wilfully
misread
he
withdrew
with
a
movement
as
abrupt
as
that
with
which
he
had
entered
why
then
with
the
memory
of
this
exultant
hour
to
fend
off
all
shadows
did
the
midnight
find
him
in
his
solitary
hangar
in
the
moonlit
woods
a
deeply
desponding
figure
again
beside
him
swung
the
huge
machine
which
represented
a
life
of
power
and
luxury
but
he
no
longer
saw
it
it
called
to
him
with
many
a
creak
and
quiet
snap
sounds
to
start
his
blood
and
fire
his
eye
a
week
nay
a
day
ago
but
he
was
deaf
to
this
music
now
the
call
went
unheeded
the
future
had
no
further
meaning
for
him
nor
did
he
know
or
think
whether
he
sat
in
light
or
in
darkness
whether
the
woods
were
silent
about
him
or
panting
with
life
and
sound
his
demon
had
gripped
him
again
and
the
final
battle
was
on
there
would
never
be
another
mighty
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
there
were
limits
even
to
his
capacity
for
endurance
he
could
sustain
no
further
conflict
how
then
would
it
end
he
never
had
a
doubt
himself
yet
he
sat
there
around
him
in
the
forest
the
night
owls
screeched
and
innumerable
small
things
without
a
name
skurried
from
lair
to
lair
he
heard
them
not
above
the
moon
rode
flecking
the
deepest
shadows
with
the
silver
from
her
urn
but
none
of
the
soft
and
healing
drops
fell
upon
him
nature
was
no
longer
a
goddess
but
an
avenger
light
a
revealer
not
a
solace
darkness
the
only
boon
nor
had
time
a
meaning
from
early
eve
to
early
morn
he
sat
there
and
knew
not
if
it
were
one
hour
or
twelve
earth
was
his
no
longer
he
roused
when
the
sun
made
everything
light
about
him
but
he
did
not
think
about
it
he
rose
but
was
not
conscious
that
he
rose
he
unlocked
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
forest
but
he
could
never
remember
doing
this
he
only
knew
later
that
he
had
been
in
the
woods
and
now
was
in
his
room
at
the
hotel
all
the
rest
was
phantasmagoria
agony
and
defeat
he
had
crossed
the
rubicon
of
this
world
s
hopes
and
fears
but
he
had
been
unconscious
of
the
passage
xxxix
the
avenger
dear
challoner
with
every
apology
for
the
intrusion
may
i
request
a
few
minutes
of
private
conversation
with
you
this
evening
at
seven
o
clock
let
it
be
in
your
own
room
yours
truly
orlando
challoner
had
been
called
upon
to
face
many
difficult
and
heartrending
duties
since
the
blow
which
had
desolated
his
home
fell
upon
him
but
from
none
of
them
had
he
shrunk
as
he
did
from
the
interview
thus
demanded
he
had
supposed
himself
rid
of
this
man
he
had
dismissed
him
from
his
life
when
he
had
dismissed
sweetwater
his
face
accordingly
wore
anything
but
a
propitiatory
look
when
promptly
at
the
hour
of
seven
orlando
brotherson
entered
his
apartments
his
pleasure
or
his
displeasure
was
however
a
matter
of
small
consequence
to
his
visitor
he
had
come
there
with
a
set
purpose
and
nothing
in
heaven
or
earth
could
deter
him
from
it
now
declining
the
offer
of
a
seat
with
the
slightest
of
acknowledgments
in
the
way
of
a
bow
he
took
a
careful
survey
of
the
room
before
saying
are
we
alone
challoner
or
is
that
man
sweetwater
lurking
somewhere
within
hearing
mr
sweetwater
is
gone
as
i
had
the
honour
of
telling
you
yesterday
was
the
somewhat
stiff
reply
there
are
no
witnesses
to
this
conference
if
that
is
what
you
wish
to
thank
you
but
you
will
pardon
my
insistence
if
i
request
the
privilege
of
closing
that
he
pointed
to
the
one
communicating
with
the
bedroom
the
information
i
have
to
give
you
is
not
such
as
i
am
willing
to
have
shared
at
least
for
the
you
may
close
the
door
said
challoner
coldly
but
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
give
me
the
information
you
mention
if
it
is
of
such
a
nature
that
you
can
not
accord
me
the
privilege
of
sharing
it
as
yet
with
others
why
not
spare
me
till
you
can
i
have
gone
through
much
you
have
came
in
steady
assent
as
the
man
thus
addressed
stepped
to
the
door
he
had
indicated
and
quietly
closed
it
but
he
continued
as
he
crossed
back
to
his
former
position
would
it
be
easier
for
you
to
go
through
the
night
now
in
anticipation
of
what
i
have
to
reveal
than
to
hear
it
at
once
from
my
lips
while
i
am
in
the
mood
to
speak
the
answer
was
slow
in
coming
the
courage
which
had
upheld
this
rapidly
aging
man
through
so
many
trying
interviews
seemed
inadequate
for
the
test
put
so
cruelly
upon
it
he
faltered
and
sank
heavily
into
a
chair
while
the
stern
man
watching
him
gave
no
signs
of
responsive
sympathy
or
even
interest
only
a
patient
and
resolve
i
can
not
live
in
uncertainty
such
were
finally
challoner
s
words
what
you
have
to
say
concerns
edith
the
pause
he
made
was
infinitesimal
in
length
but
it
was
long
enough
for
a
quick
disclaimer
but
no
such
disclaimer
came
i
will
hear
it
came
in
reluctant
finish
brotherson
took
a
step
forward
his
manner
was
as
cold
as
the
heart
which
lay
like
a
stone
in
his
bosom
will
you
pardon
me
if
i
ask
you
to
rise
said
he
i
have
my
weaknesses
he
gave
no
sign
of
them
i
can
not
speak
down
from
such
a
height
to
the
man
i
am
bound
to
as
if
answering
to
the
constraint
of
a
will
quite
outside
his
own
challoner
rose
their
heads
were
now
more
nearly
on
a
level
and
brotherson
s
voice
remained
low
as
he
proceeded
with
quiet
intensity
there
has
been
a
time
and
it
may
exist
yet
god
knows
when
you
thought
me
in
some
unknown
and
secret
way
the
murderer
of
your
daughter
i
do
not
quarrel
with
the
suspicion
it
was
justified
challoner
i
did
kill
your
daughter
and
with
this
hand
i
can
no
longer
deny
the
wretched
father
swayed
following
the
gesture
of
the
hand
thus
held
out
but
he
did
not
fall
nor
did
a
sound
leave
his
lips
brotherson
went
coldly
on
i
did
it
because
i
regarded
her
treatment
of
my
suit
as
insolent
i
have
no
mercy
for
any
such
display
of
intolerance
on
the
part
of
the
rich
and
the
fortunate
i
hated
her
for
it
i
hated
her
class
herself
and
all
she
stood
for
to
strike
the
dealer
of
such
a
hurt
i
felt
to
be
my
right
though
a
man
of
small
beginnings
and
of
a
stock
which
such
as
you
call
common
i
have
a
pride
which
few
of
your
blood
can
equal
i
could
not
work
or
sleep
or
eat
with
such
a
sting
in
my
breast
as
she
had
planted
there
to
rid
myself
of
it
i
determined
to
kill
her
and
i
did
how
oh
that
was
easy
though
it
has
proved
a
great
to
the
detectives
as
i
knew
it
would
i
shot
her
but
not
with
an
ordinary
bullet
my
charge
was
a
small
icicle
made
deliberately
for
the
purpose
it
had
strength
enough
to
penetrate
but
it
left
no
trace
behind
it
a
bullet
of
ice
for
a
heart
of
ice
i
had
said
in
the
torment
of
my
rage
but
the
word
was
without
knowledge
challoner
i
see
it
now
i
have
seen
it
for
two
whole
weeks
i
did
not
misjudge
her
condemnation
of
me
but
i
misjudged
its
cause
it
was
not
to
the
comparatively
poor
the
comparatively
obscure
man
she
sought
to
show
contempt
but
to
the
brother
of
oswald
whose
claims
she
saw
insulted
a
woman
i
should
have
respected
not
killed
a
woman
of
no
pride
of
station
a
woman
who
loved
a
man
not
only
of
my
own
class
but
of
my
own
blood
a
woman
to
avenge
whose
unmerited
death
i
stand
here
before
you
a
criminal
that
is
but
justice
challoner
that
is
the
way
i
look
at
things
though
no
sentimentalist
and
dead
to
all
beliefs
save
the
eternal
truths
of
science
i
have
that
in
me
which
will
not
let
me
profit
now
that
i
know
myself
unworthy
by
the
great
success
i
have
earned
hence
this
confession
challoner
it
has
not
come
easily
nor
do
i
shut
my
eyes
in
the
least
to
the
results
which
must
follow
but
i
can
not
do
differently
you
may
telegraph
to
new
york
till
then
i
desire
to
be
left
undisturbed
i
have
many
things
to
dispose
of
in
the
challoner
very
white
by
now
pointed
to
the
door
before
he
sank
again
into
his
chair
brotherson
took
it
for
dismissal
and
stepped
slowly
back
then
their
eyes
met
again
and
challoner
spoke
his
first
word
there
was
another
a
poor
woman
she
died
suddenly
and
her
wound
was
not
unlike
that
inflicted
upon
edith
did
you
i
the
answer
came
without
a
tremour
you
may
say
and
so
may
others
that
i
was
less
justified
in
this
attack
than
in
the
other
but
i
do
not
see
it
that
way
a
theory
does
not
always
work
in
practice
i
wished
to
test
the
unusual
means
i
contemplated
and
the
woman
i
saw
before
me
across
the
court
was
and
with
nothing
in
life
to
look
forward
to
so
a
cry
of
bitter
execration
from
challoner
cut
him
short
turning
with
a
shrug
he
was
about
to
lift
his
hand
to
the
door
when
he
gave
a
violent
start
and
fell
hastily
back
before
a
quickly
entering
figure
of
such
passion
and
fury
as
neither
of
these
men
had
ever
seen
before
it
was
oswald
oswald
the
kindly
oswald
the
lover
of
men
and
the
adorer
of
women
oswald
with
the
words
of
the
dastardly
confession
he
had
partly
overheard
searing
hot
within
his
brain
oswald
raised
in
a
moment
from
the
desponding
invalid
to
a
terrifying
ministrant
of
retributive
justice
orlando
could
scarcely
raise
his
hand
before
the
other
s
was
upon
his
throat
murderer
murderer
of
innocent
women
was
hissed
in
the
strong
man
s
ears
not
with
the
law
but
with
me
you
must
reckon
and
may
god
and
the
spirit
of
my
mother
nerve
my
arm
xl
desolate
the
struggle
was
fierce
but
momentary
oswald
with
his
weakened
powers
could
not
long
withstand
the
steady
exertion
of
orlando
s
giant
strength
and
ere
long
sank
away
from
the
contest
into
challoner
s
arms
you
should
not
have
summoned
the
shade
of
our
mother
to
your
aid
observed
the
other
with
a
smile
in
which
the
irony
was
lost
in
terrible
presage
i
was
always
her
oswald
shuddered
orlando
had
spoken
truly
she
had
always
been
blindly
arrogantly
trustful
of
her
eldest
son
no
fault
could
she
see
in
him
and
now
impetuously
oswald
struggled
with
his
weakness
raised
himself
in
challoner
s
arms
and
cried
in
loud
revolt
but
god
is
just
he
will
not
let
you
escape
if
he
does
i
will
not
i
will
hound
you
to
the
ends
of
this
earth
and
if
necessary
into
the
eternities
not
with
the
threat
of
my
arm
you
are
my
master
there
but
with
the
curse
of
a
brother
who
believed
you
innocent
of
his
darling
s
blood
and
would
have
believed
you
so
in
face
of
everything
but
your
own
peace
adjured
orlando
there
is
no
account
i
am
not
ready
to
settle
i
have
robbed
you
of
the
woman
you
love
but
i
have
despoiled
myself
i
stand
desolate
in
the
world
who
but
an
hour
ago
could
have
chosen
my
seat
among
the
best
and
greatest
what
can
your
curses
do
after
that
the
word
came
slowly
like
a
drop
wrung
from
a
nearly
spent
heart
nothing
nothing
oh
orlando
i
wish
we
were
both
dead
and
buried
and
that
there
were
no
further
life
for
either
of
the
softened
tone
the
wistful
prayer
which
would
blot
out
an
immortality
of
joy
for
the
one
that
it
might
save
the
other
from
an
immortality
of
retribution
touched
some
long
unsounded
chord
in
orlando
s
extraordinary
nature
advancing
a
step
he
held
out
his
hand
the
left
one
we
ll
leave
the
future
to
itself
oswald
and
do
what
we
can
with
the
present
said
he
i
ve
made
a
mess
of
my
life
and
spoiled
a
career
which
might
have
made
us
both
kings
forgive
me
oswald
i
ask
for
nothing
else
from
god
or
man
i
should
like
that
it
would
strengthen
me
for
but
oswald
ever
kindly
generous
and
more
ready
to
think
of
others
than
of
himself
had
yet
some
of
orlando
s
tenacity
he
gazed
at
that
hand
and
a
flush
swept
up
over
his
cheek
which
instantly
became
ghastly
again
i
can
not
said
he
not
even
the
left
one
may
god
forgive
me
orlando
struck
silent
for
a
moment
dropped
his
hand
and
slowly
turned
away
challoner
felt
oswald
stiffen
in
his
arms
and
break
suddenly
away
only
to
stop
short
before
he
had
taken
one
of
the
half
dozen
steps
between
himself
and
his
departing
brother
where
are
you
going
he
demanded
in
tones
which
made
orlando
turn
i
might
say
to
the
devil
was
the
sarcastic
reply
but
i
doubt
if
he
would
receive
me
no
he
added
in
more
ordinary
tones
as
the
other
shivered
and
again
started
forward
you
will
have
no
trouble
in
finding
me
in
my
own
room
i
have
letters
to
write
and
other
things
a
man
like
me
can
not
drop
out
without
a
ripple
you
may
go
to
bed
and
sleep
i
will
keep
awake
for
orlando
visions
were
passing
before
oswald
s
eyes
visions
such
as
in
his
blameless
life
he
never
thought
could
enter
into
his
consciousness
or
blast
his
tranquil
outlook
upon
life
orlando
he
again
appealed
covering
his
eyes
in
a
frenzied
attempt
to
shut
out
these
horrors
i
can
not
let
you
go
like
this
in
every
niche
and
corner
of
this
world
wherever
edith
challoner
s
name
has
gone
wherever
my
name
has
gone
it
will
be
known
that
the
discoverer
of
a
practical
is
a
man
whom
they
can
no
longer
honour
do
you
think
that
is
not
hell
enough
for
me
or
that
i
do
not
realise
the
hell
it
will
be
for
you
i
ve
never
wearied
you
or
any
man
with
my
affection
but
i
m
not
all
demon
i
would
gladly
have
spared
you
this
additional
anguish
but
that
was
impossible
you
are
my
brother
and
must
suffer
from
the
connection
whether
we
would
have
it
so
or
not
if
it
promises
too
much
misery
and
i
know
no
misery
like
that
of
shame
come
with
me
where
i
go
there
will
be
room
for
oswald
swaying
with
weakness
but
maddened
by
the
sight
of
an
overthrow
which
carried
with
it
the
stifled
affections
and
the
admiration
of
his
whole
life
gave
a
bound
forward
opened
his
arms
and
fell
orlando
stopped
short
gazing
down
on
his
prostrate
brother
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
a
gleam
of
something
like
human
tenderness
showing
through
the
flare
of
dying
passions
and
perishing
hopes
then
he
swung
open
the
door
and
passed
quietly
out
and
challoner
could
hear
the
laughing
remark
with
which
he
met
and
dismissed
the
men
and
women
who
had
been
drawn
to
this
end
of
the
hall
by
what
had
sounded
to
them
like
a
fracas
between
angry
men
xli
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
clock
in
the
hotel
office
struck
three
orlando
brotherson
counted
the
strokes
then
went
on
writing
his
transom
was
partly
open
and
he
had
just
heard
a
step
go
by
his
door
this
was
nothing
new
he
had
already
heard
it
several
times
before
that
night
it
was
challoner
s
step
and
every
time
it
passed
he
had
rustled
his
papers
or
scratched
vigorously
with
his
pen
he
is
keeping
watch
for
oswald
was
his
thought
they
fear
a
sudden
end
to
this
no
one
not
the
son
of
my
mother
knows
me
do
i
know
myself
four
o
clock
the
light
was
still
burning
the
pile
of
letters
he
was
writing
increasing
five
o
clock
a
rattling
shade
betrays
an
open
window
no
other
sound
disturbs
the
quiet
of
the
room
it
is
empty
now
but
challoner
long
since
satisfied
that
all
was
well
goes
by
no
more
silence
has
settled
upon
the
hotel
that
heavy
silence
which
precedes
the
dawn
there
was
silence
in
the
streets
also
the
few
who
were
abroad
crept
quietly
along
an
electric
storm
was
in
the
air
and
the
surcharged
clouds
hung
heavy
and
low
biding
the
moment
of
outbreak
a
man
who
had
left
a
place
of
many
shadows
for
the
more
open
road
paused
and
looked
up
at
these
clouds
then
went
calmly
on
suddenly
the
shriek
of
an
approaching
train
tears
through
the
valley
has
it
a
call
for
this
man
no
yet
he
pauses
in
the
midst
of
the
street
he
is
crossing
and
watches
as
a
child
might
watch
for
the
flash
of
its
lights
at
the
end
of
the
darkened
vista
it
comes
filling
the
empty
space
at
which
he
stares
with
moving
life
engine
baggage
car
and
a
long
string
of
pullmans
then
all
is
dark
again
and
only
the
noise
of
its
slackening
wheels
comes
to
him
through
the
night
it
has
stopped
at
the
station
a
minute
longer
and
it
has
started
again
and
the
quickly
lessening
rumble
of
its
departure
is
all
that
remains
of
this
vision
of
man
s
activity
and
ceaseless
expectancy
when
it
is
quite
gone
and
all
is
quiet
a
sigh
falls
from
the
man
s
lips
and
he
moves
on
but
this
time
for
some
unexplainable
reason
in
the
direction
of
the
station
with
lowered
head
he
passes
along
noting
little
till
he
arrives
within
sight
of
the
depot
where
some
freight
is
being
handled
and
a
trunk
or
two
wheeled
down
the
platform
no
sight
could
be
more
ordinary
or
unsuggestive
but
it
has
its
attraction
for
him
for
he
looks
up
as
he
goes
by
and
follows
the
passage
of
that
truck
down
the
platform
till
it
has
reached
the
corner
and
disappeared
then
he
sighs
again
and
again
moves
on
a
cluster
of
houses
one
of
them
open
and
lighted
was
all
which
lay
between
him
now
and
the
country
road
he
was
hurrying
past
for
his
step
had
unconsciously
quickened
as
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
station
when
he
was
seized
again
by
that
mood
of
curiosity
and
stepped
up
to
the
door
from
which
a
light
issued
and
looked
in
a
common
lay
before
him
with
rudely
spread
tables
and
one
very
sleepy
waiter
taking
orders
from
a
new
arrival
who
sat
with
his
back
to
the
door
why
did
the
lonely
man
on
the
sidewalk
start
as
his
eye
fell
on
the
latter
s
commonplace
figure
a
hungry
man
demanding
breakfast
in
a
cheap
country
restaurant
his
own
physique
was
powerful
while
that
of
the
other
looked
slim
and
frail
but
fear
was
in
the
air
and
the
brooding
of
a
tempest
affects
some
temperaments
in
a
totally
unexpected
manner
as
the
man
inside
turns
slightly
and
looks
up
the
master
figure
on
the
sidewalk
vanishes
and
his
step
if
any
one
had
been
interested
enough
to
listen
rings
with
a
new
note
as
it
turns
into
the
country
road
it
has
at
last
reached
but
no
one
heeded
the
new
arrival
munches
his
roll
and
waits
impatiently
for
his
coffee
while
without
the
clouds
pile
soundlessly
in
the
sky
one
of
them
taking
the
form
of
a
huge
hand
with
clutching
fingers
reaching
down
into
the
hollow
void
beneath
xlii
at
six
challoner
had
been
honest
in
his
statement
regarding
the
departure
of
sweetwater
he
had
not
only
paid
and
dismissed
our
young
detective
but
he
had
seen
him
take
the
train
for
new
york
and
sweetwater
had
gone
away
in
good
faith
too
possibly
with
his
convictions
undisturbed
but
acknowledging
at
last
that
he
had
reached
the
end
of
his
resources
but
the
brain
does
not
loose
its
hold
upon
its
work
as
readily
as
the
hand
does
he
was
halfway
to
new
york
and
had
consciously
bidden
farewell
to
the
whole
subject
when
he
suddenly
startled
those
about
him
by
rising
impetuously
to
his
feet
he
sat
again
immediately
but
with
a
light
in
his
small
grey
eye
which
gryce
would
have
understood
and
revelled
in
the
idea
for
which
he
had
searched
industriously
for
months
had
come
at
last
unbidden
thrown
up
from
some
remote
recess
of
the
mind
which
had
seemingly
closed
upon
the
subject
forever
i
have
it
i
have
it
he
murmured
in
ceaseless
reiteration
to
himself
i
will
go
back
to
challoner
and
let
him
decide
if
the
idea
is
worth
pursuing
perhaps
an
experiment
may
be
necessary
it
was
bitter
cold
that
night
i
wish
it
were
icy
weather
now
but
a
chemist
can
help
us
out
good
god
if
this
should
be
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
alas
for
orlando
and
alas
for
oswald
but
his
sympathies
did
not
deter
him
he
returned
to
derby
at
once
and
as
soon
as
he
dared
presented
himself
at
the
hotel
and
asked
for
challoner
he
was
amazed
to
find
that
gentleman
already
up
and
in
a
state
of
agitation
that
was
very
disquieting
but
he
brightened
wonderfully
at
sight
of
his
visitor
and
drawing
him
inside
the
room
observed
with
trembling
eagerness
i
do
not
know
why
you
have
come
back
but
never
was
man
more
welcome
brotherson
has
confessed
yes
he
killed
both
women
my
daughter
and
his
neighbour
the
washerwoman
with
a
wait
broke
in
sweetwater
eagerly
let
me
tell
and
stooping
he
whispered
something
in
the
other
s
ear
challoner
stared
at
him
amazed
then
slowly
nodded
his
head
how
came
you
to
think
he
began
but
sweetwater
in
his
great
anxiety
interrupted
him
with
a
quick
explanations
will
keep
challoner
what
of
the
man
himself
where
is
he
that
s
the
important
thing
he
was
in
his
room
till
early
this
morning
writing
letters
but
he
is
not
there
now
the
door
is
unlocked
and
i
went
in
from
appearances
i
fear
the
worst
that
is
why
your
presence
relieves
me
so
where
do
you
think
he
is
in
his
hangar
in
the
woods
where
else
would
he
go
to
i
have
thought
of
that
shall
we
start
out
alone
or
take
witnesses
with
us
we
will
go
alone
does
oswald
anticipate
he
is
sure
but
he
lacks
strength
to
move
he
lies
on
my
bed
in
there
doris
and
her
father
are
with
we
will
not
wait
a
minute
how
the
storm
holds
off
i
hope
it
will
hold
off
for
another
challoner
made
no
reply
he
had
spoken
because
he
felt
compelled
to
speak
but
it
had
not
been
easy
for
him
nor
could
any
trifles
move
him
now
the
town
was
up
by
this
time
and
though
they
chose
the
least
frequented
streets
they
had
to
suffer
from
some
encounters
it
was
a
good
half
hour
before
they
found
themselves
in
the
forest
and
in
sight
of
the
hangar
one
look
that
way
and
sweetwater
turned
to
see
what
the
effect
was
upon
challoner
a
murmur
of
dismay
greeted
him
the
oval
of
that
great
lid
stood
up
against
the
forest
background
he
has
escaped
cried
challoner
but
sweetwater
laying
a
finger
on
his
lip
advanced
and
laid
his
ear
against
the
door
then
he
cast
a
quick
look
aloft
nothing
was
to
be
seen
there
the
darkness
of
storm
in
the
heavens
but
nothing
yes
now
a
flash
of
vivid
and
destructive
lightning
the
two
men
drew
back
and
their
glances
crossed
let
us
return
to
the
highroad
whispered
sweetwater
we
can
see
nothing
challoner
trembling
very
much
wheeled
slowly
about
wait
enjoined
sweetwater
first
let
me
take
a
look
running
to
the
nearest
tree
he
quickly
climbed
it
worked
himself
along
a
protruding
branch
and
looked
down
into
the
open
hangar
it
was
now
so
dark
that
details
escaped
him
but
one
thing
was
certain
the
was
not
there
descending
he
drew
challoner
hastily
along
he
s
gone
said
he
let
us
reach
the
high
ground
as
quickly
as
we
can
i
m
glad
that
oswald
brotherson
is
not
with
us
or
or
miss
but
this
expression
of
satisfaction
died
on
his
lips
at
the
point
where
the
forest
road
debouches
into
the
highway
he
had
already
caught
a
glimpse
of
their
two
figures
they
were
waiting
for
news
and
the
brother
spoke
up
the
instant
he
saw
sweetwater
where
is
he
you
ve
not
found
him
or
you
wouldn
t
be
coming
alone
he
can
not
have
gone
up
he
can
not
manage
it
without
an
assistant
we
must
seek
him
somewhere
else
in
the
forest
or
in
our
house
at
home
ah
the
lightning
had
forked
again
he
s
not
in
the
forest
and
he
s
not
in
your
home
returned
sweetwater
he
s
aloft
the
is
not
in
the
shed
and
he
can
go
up
alone
then
more
slowly
but
he
can
not
come
they
strained
their
eyes
in
a
maddening
search
of
the
heavens
but
the
darkness
had
so
increased
that
they
could
be
sure
of
nothing
doris
sank
upon
her
knees
suddenly
the
lightning
flashed
again
this
time
so
vividly
and
so
near
that
the
whole
heaven
burst
into
fiery
illumination
above
them
and
the
thunder
crashing
almost
simultaneously
seemed
for
a
moment
to
rock
the
world
and
bow
the
heavens
towards
them
then
a
silence
then
sweetwater
s
whisper
in
challoner
s
ear
take
them
away
i
saw
him
he
was
falling
like
a
challoner
threw
out
his
arms
then
steadied
himself
oswald
was
reeling
oswald
had
seen
too
but
doris
was
there
when
the
lightning
flashed
again
she
was
standing
and
oswald
was
weeping
on
her
bosom
