dear
henry
arrogate
entirely
too
much
to
themselves
i
know
this
is
so
i
discovered
it
for
a
fact
when
i
was
not
more
than
to
a
grasshopper
myself
i
knew
for
example
that
a
certain
amount
of
dirt
on
my
face
and
hands
in
no
way
interfered
with
my
enjoyment
of
my
supper
the
fact
that
my
finger
nails
were
not
all
they
should
have
been
had
no
bearing
whatsoever
upon
the
efficiency
of
those
same
fingers
washing
not
only
took
time
from
other
important
pursuits
but
also
was
mildly
unpleasant
nevertheless
my
mother
was
not
even
open
to
reasonable
argument
on
the
matter
arbitrarily
with
the
despotism
of
an
early
roman
emperor
she
rendered
a
dictum
to
the
effect
that
i
must
wash
and
soapy
and
submissive
i
had
to
be
before
i
could
come
to
the
table
again
any
reasonable
child
can
tell
you
that
pleasure
is
the
main
object
of
eating
therefore
in
all
logic
one
should
eat
if
one
feels
like
it
at
ten
in
the
morning
or
at
three
in
the
afternoon
a
jar
of
guava
jelly
a
pound
of
chocolates
a
paper
of
ginger
cookies
or
whatever
may
appeal
to
one
aesthetic
taste
this
method
of
procedure
naturally
might
necessitate
recourse
to
the
family
medicine
closet
certain
discomfort
might
ensue
but
was
not
the
pleasure
worth
it
again
my
mother
arbitrarily
took
the
matter
into
her
own
hands
disagreeing
with
me
on
fundamentals
she
maintained
that
eating
was
not
for
pleasure
simply
but
for
nourishment
sundry
unfortunate
remarks
were
made
containing
references
to
gluttony
the
pantry
was
locked
and
regular
meals
at
regular
periods
were
prescribed
indeed
poems
with
dreadful
morals
for
those
who
ate
between
meals
were
recited
to
me
endeavor
being
made
thereby
to
substitute
terror
for
inclination
any
reasonable
child
will
find
many
such
parallel
instances
of
the
assumed
omnipotence
of
grownups
with
this
awful
indictment
before
me
you
ask
me
a
to
write
an
introduction
for
the
firelight
fairy
book
and
thereby
to
assume
the
responsibility
for
passing
judgment
upon
it
there
is
but
one
circumstance
that
makes
me
willing
to
do
so
i
believe
that
where
any
nice
is
concerned
if
you
crack
the
hard
outside
shell
with
which
circumstances
have
surrounded
him
beneath
it
you
will
find
a
child
banking
on
this
i
venture
to
say
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
firelight
fairy
book
i
liked
particularly
the
story
of
the
poor
little
prince
whose
sneezing
had
such
a
disastrous
effect
and
the
lost
half
hour
is
unquestionably
an
accurate
historical
account
because
no
one
could
have
described
so
accurately
simply
from
imagination
what
a
lost
temper
looked
like
what
makes
me
even
more
willing
to
advance
my
opinion
is
that
i
do
not
stand
alone
my
conclusions
are
supported
by
a
jury
of
my
peers
for
i
have
given
the
book
as
a
christmas
gift
not
only
to
my
own
children
but
to
other
people
children
and
to
one
of
the
prominent
senators
of
the
united
states
they
have
universally
acclaimed
it
and
who
can
question
the
judgment
of
such
a
jury
good
luck
to
the
firelight
fairy
book
may
it
like
scrooge
laugh
in
the
christmas
carol
be
the
father
of
a
long
long
line
of
brilliant
books
of
a
like
nature
for
the
enjoyment
of
all
true
children
whether
they
be
still
at

in
the
high

how
the
new
fairy
tales
came
to
be
written
some
twenty
years
ago
in
a
pleasant
old
town
by
the
sea
lived
a
lad
who
was
very
very
fond
of
fairy
tales
when
he
had
read
all
the
which
his
parents
and
his
uncles
and
his
cousins
and
his
sisters
and
his
aunts
had
been
kind
enough
to
give
him
he
turned
to
the
town
library
and
read
every
single
fairy
tale
he
could
find
mentioned
in
the
catalogue
but
there
was
an
end
even
to
this
treasure
and
finally
a
day
came
when
the
lover
could
find
no
new
tales
to
read
every
christmas
he
would
peek
at
the
new
books
in
the
bookshops
only
to
find
the
same
old
stories
printed
with
new
pictures
meant
to
please
what
could
be
the
matter
had
the
fairies
all
gone
away
or
locked
the
doors
of
fairyland
where
where
where
were
the
new
stories
and
why
why
why
did
people
write
them
some
years
passed
one
pleasant
summer
day
as
the
lover
sat
reading
a
book
beneath
the
low
spreading
branches
of
an
oak
tree
he
heard
a
hum
of
wings
and
looking
up
startled
from
his
book
he
discovered
the
fairy
goldenwand
standing
close
by
are
you
still
seeking
new
fairy
tales
said
the
fairy
goldenwand
yes
said
the
reader
will
you
write
them
down
if
i
tell
you
some
really
new
ones
said
the
fairy
oh
yes
indeed
said
the
reader
and
i
put
them
into
a
book
and
next
saturday
day
the
artist
will
come
down
we
shall
have
tea
here
under
the
oak
tree
do
you
like
hot
buttered
toast
and
you
must
tell
him
all
about
the
fashions
in
fairyland
oh
that
will
be
fine
said
the
fairy
goldenwand
i
knew
you
would
mind
my
appearing
so
suddenly
ever
so
many
things
have
happened
in
fairyland
since
the
last
books
were
written
and
we
all
think
it
a
dreadful
shame
that
children
have
heard
about
them
just
imagine
boys
and
girls
not
knowing
about
the
adventures
of
the
prince
in
lantern

i

the
queen
of

once
upon
a
time
the
youngest
son
of
a
king
became
filled
with
the
desire
to
go
abroad
and
see
the
world
he
got
his
father
permission
to
depart
kissed
his
parents
mounted
his
black
horse
and
galloped
away
down
the
high
road
soon
the
gray
towers
of
the
old
castle
in
which
he
was
born
hid
themselves
behind
him
the
prince
journeyed
on
spending
the
days
in
traveling
and
the
nights
in
little
wayside
inns
till
one
day
he
found
himself
in
the
heart
of
the
adamant
mountains
the
great
red
granite
crags
of
the
surrounding
peaks
rose
out
of
the
gleaming
snow
like
ugly
fingers
and
the
slopes
of
giant
glaciers
sparkled
in
the
sun
like
torrents
of
diamonds
the
prince
sat
down
by
some
stunted
trees
whose
tops
had
long
before
been
broken
off
by
an
avalanche
and
began
to
eat
the
bit
of
bread
and
cheese
which
he
had
stored
in
his
pocket
his
black
horse
meanwhile
ate
the
grass
which
grew
here
and
there
along
the
mountain
path
and
as
the
prince
sat
there
in
the
bright
sun
and
the
silence
of
the
mountains
he
became
aware
of
a
low
continuous
roaring
there
must
be
a
waterfall
said
the
prince
to
himself
go
and
see
it
so
casting
another
look
at
his
steed
who
was
contentedly
browsing
the
prince
climbed
up
the
mountainside
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
the
prince
climbed
and
climbed
he
went
in
this
direction
and
in
that
yet
the
sound
never
grew
any
louder
or
fainter
suddenly
he
realized
that
he
was
hopelessly
lost
the
little
path
up
which
he
had
ridden
had
vanished
completely
and
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
in
which
direction
it
lay
he
called
aloud
but
only
the
mountain
echoes
answered
mockingly
night
came
and
the
prince
took
shelter
behind
a
great
rock
all
the
next
day
he
labored
to
find
the
path
but
in
vain
he
grew
very
hungry
and
cold
every
once
in
a
while
he
would
hear
the
roaring
of
the
waterfall
which
seemed
to
have
grown
louder
another
day
dawned
and
another
day
again
the
prince
was
getting
very
weak
he
knew
that
he
was
approaching
the
mysterious
cataract
for
the
noise
of
the
water
was
now
tremendous
and
heaven
and
earth
were
full
of
its
roar
the
third
night
came
and
the
full
moon
rose
solemnly
over
the
summits
of
the
lonely
and
mysterious
mountains
suddenly
the
prince
walking
blindly
on
staggered
through
a
narrow
between
two
splintered
crags
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
mystery
he
stood
on
the
snowy
floor
of
a
vast
amphitheatre
whose
walls
were
the
steep
sides
of
the
giant
mountains
farthest
away
from
him
and
opposite
the
moon
the
wall
of
the
bowl
appeared
as
a
giant
black
precipice
whose
top
seemed
to
reach
almost
to
the
stars
and
over
this
precipice
a
broad
river
was
endlessly
pouring
shining
in
the
night
like
the
overflow
of
an
ocean
of
molten
silver
though
now
very
weak
from
lack
of
food
and
dizzy
with
the
roaring
of
the
cataract
the
prince
made
his
way
to
the
shore
of
the
foaming
and
eddying
lake
into
which
the
water
was
falling
great
was
his
surprise
to
discover
that
the
overflow
of
this
lake
disappeared
into
the
earth
through
a
long
low
opening
in
the
cliff
behind
the
fall
greater
still
was
his
surprise
to
see
a
strange
light
burning
within
the
cave
the
prince
made
his
way
toward
the
light
along
a
narrow
beach
of
white
sand
lying
between
the
wall
of
the
cavern
and
the
racing
waters
of
the
mysterious
river
and
found
that
the
glow
came
from
a
magnificent
lantern
studded
with
emeralds
topazes
amethysts
and
rubies
which
hung
by
a
chain
from
the
roof
of
the
grotto
directly
under
this
lantern
drawn
up
on
the
sand
lay
a
little
boat
with
a
lantern
fastened
to
the
bow
the
prince
pushed
the
boat
into
the
river
and
got
into
it
and
the
swift
current
seized
him
and
hurried
him
away
at
first
the
cavern
grew
higher
and
wider
then
it
shrank
again
and
the
boat
borne
along
with
incredible
speed
shot
down
a
rocky
passageway
into
the
very
heart
of
the
earth
the
passageway
broadened
once
more
and
the
boat
rode
gently
through
monstrous
caves
whose
roofs
were
upheld
by
twisted
columns
taller
than
the
tallest
tree
there
were
times
when
all
was
so
still
that
the
prince
could
easily
have
imagined
himself
back
in
the
solitude
of
the
mountains
there
were
times
when
the
foaming
and
roaring
of
the
underground
river
grew
so
deafening
that
the
prince
feared
lest
he
might
be
approaching
the
brink
of
a
subterranean
cataract
many
hours
passed
the
prince
did
not
know
whether
it
was
night
or
day
at
length
while
the
boat
was
gliding
through
a
vast
hall
he
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
he
found
that
the
boat
was
floating
on
the
black
glassy
surface
of
an
immense
underground
ocean
all
signs
of
the
cavern
had
disappeared
far
away
over
the
edge
of
this
ocean
a
strange
beautiful
glow
mounted
into
the
starless
sky
of
the
underworld
and
while
the
prince
was
gazing
at
the
glow
the
boat
swung
into
a
new
current
and
was
borne
swiftly
toward
the
light
in
a
short
time
the
light
grew
so
wide
and
bright
that
one
would
have
believed
that
a
strange
golden
sun
had
risen
the
boat
passed
between
two
giant
marble
pillars
supporting
enormous
crystal
globes
filled
with
a
golden
fire
and
the
prince
found
himself
in
the
harbor
of
lantern
land
a
city
lay
before
him
a
strange
golden
city
edging
the
shore
of
a
vast
bay
because
in
the
centre
of
the
earth
there
is
neither
sun
nor
moon
the
people
have
to
be
continually
burning
lights
and
so
many
and
so
great
were
the
lanterns
of
lantern
land
that
the
town
was
as
bright
as
day
the
edge
of
the
harbor
was
marked
with
a
row
of
golden
lanterns
there
were
immense
lanterns
at
every
six
paces
along
the
streets
a
lantern
hung
from
every
house
and
the
instead
of
having
bells
in
them
had
great
golden
lamps
which
illumined
everything
for
some
distance
about
moreover
every
inhabitant
of
lantern
land
carried
a
lantern
with
him
wherever
he
went
the
rich
carrying
golden
lanterns
set
with
transparent
precious
stones
the
poor
carrying
lights
of
ordinary
glass
soon
the
prince
saw
a
magnificent
ship
coming
out
to
meet
him
the
prow
was
carved
in
the
shape
of
a
dragon
head
and
a
beautiful
lantern
hung
from
its
jaws
overcome
by
hunger
and
fatigue
the
poor
prince
fell
insensible
to
the
floor
of
his
little
boat
when
he
came
to
his
senses
again
he
was
lying
between
sheets
of
the
whitest
most
delicate
linen
in
a
great
bed
in
a
room
in
the
royal
palace
thanks
to
his
kind
hosts
the
prince
soon
recovered
his
strength
when
he
was
completely
himself
again
he
was
summoned
to
an
audience
with
the
queen
of
lantern
land
the
queen
a
very
beautiful
young
woman
wearing
a
wonderful
lantern
crown
sat
on
an
ebony
throne
on
each
side
of
the
throne
stood
a
tall
soldier
clad
in
scarlet
and
holding
a
long
ebony
staff
surmounted
by
a
round
lantern
lit
by
a
golden
flame
the
prince
dropped
on
his
knee
and
thanked
the
queen
for
her
kindness
and
hospitality
you
are
the
first
stranger
to
come
to
lantern
land
for
a
thousand
years
said
the
young
queen
if
it
is
not
asking
too
much
from
a
guest
pray
how
did
you
happen
to
find
the
river
of
the
underworld
so
the
prince
told
her
that
he
was
a
king
son
and
described
his
adventures
in
the
mountains
you
may
be
sure
the
queen
was
glad
to
hear
of
his
royal
birth
for
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
at
first
sight
a
month
passed
the
prince
remained
a
guest
in
the
palace
all
kinds
of
festivities
were
given
in
his
honor
there
were
wonderful
dances
masquerades
picnics
and
theatricals
going
on
all
the
time
one
day
the
prince
and
the
queen
accompanied
by
a
little
group
of
courtiers
rode
to
the
frontier
of
lantern
land
the
lovers
galloped
ahead
of
the
party
and
reached
a
little
hill
beyond
which
there
were
no
more
lanterns
ahead
of
them
the
rolling
land
sweeping
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
light
grew
darker
and
darker
till
it
finally
plunged
into
the
eternal
night
of
the
underworld
the
prince
looked
at
the
queen
and
saw
that
she
was
weeping
dear
love
why
do
you
weep
asked
the
prince
who
felt
sad
to
see
tears
in
his
lady
lovely
eyes
i
weep
to
think
that
in
spite
of
our
love
we
must
soon
part
forever
said
the
queen
part
forever
dear
lady
what
can
you
mean
said
the
anxious
prince
a
cruel
fate
hangs
over
us
replied
the
lady
know
dear
prince
that
i
am
promised
in
marriage
to
the
enchanter
dragondel
and
that
in
exactly
eight
days
he
will
come
here
to
claim
my
hand
the
enchanter
dragondel
who
is
he
said
the
prince
alas
said
the
queen
the
enchanter
dragondel
is
the
most
powerful
magician
of
all
the
underworld
he
is
about
eight
feet
tall
has
cruel
sunken
eyes
that
burn
like
dull
fires
and
dresses
entirely
in
black
we
met
at
a
ball
given
by
the
king
of
the
goblins
dragondel
pursued
me
with
compliments
a
few
days
afterwards
an
iron
boat
arrived
in
the
port
of
lantern
land
having
on
board
a
giant
blue
dog
who
is
dragondel
younger
brother
this
terrible
animal
from
whose
sight
the
people
of
lantern
land
fled
screaming
made
his
way
to
the
palace
and
dropped
at
my
feet
a
jeweled
casket
which
he
carried
between
his
jaws
the
casket
contained
dragondel
request
for
my
hand
and
added
that
were
i
to
refuse
him
he
would
let
loose
a
legion
of
ghosts
and
other
winged
spirits
against
the
lanterns
of
lantern
land
i
had
a
vision
of
lantern
land
in
darkness
of
my
poor
subjects
dying
of
fear
and
starvation
rather
than
let
this
vision
come
true
i
accepted
the
enchanter
soon
i
shall
never
see
you
again
for
dragondel
will
come
and
take
me
to
his
awful
castle
which
lies
on
an
island
in
the
dark
ocean
nor
will
you
ever
be
able
to
save
me
for
dragondel
has
so
bewitched
the
waves
that
a
terrible
whirlpool
forms
on
the
sea
when
a
boat
approaches
the
enchanted
castle
and
engulfs
it
but
i
can
fight
dragondel
said
the
prince
like
the
brave
youth
that
he
was
that
would
be
of
little
use
replied
the
queen
for
you
would
be
changed
into
a
stone
the
instant
you
crossed
swords
with
him
tomorrow
the
blue
dog
arrives
to
remind
me
of
my
obligation
and
to
carry
back
to
the
island
some
of
the
palace
servants
who
are
to
make
castle
ready
for
my
coming
the
other
members
of
the
party
now
rode
up
and
the
queen
dabbed
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
and
pretended
not
to
have
been
crying
the
prince
and
the
queen
felt
very
unhappy
as
they
rode
home
on
the
next
day
sure
enough
the
iron
boat
arrived
and
the
blue
dog
who
was
as
large
as
a
lion
went
to
the
queen
palace
and
bade
her
make
ready
for
the
coming
wedding
a
dozen
of
the
queen
servants
were
then
ordered
to
go
with
the
blue
dog
to
dragondel
castle
among
these
servants
disguised
as
a
kitchen
lad
was
the
prince
for
he
had
determined
to
see
if
there
was
not
some
way
in
which
the
young
queen
could
be
rescued
from
the
wicked
magician
the
boat
neared
the
island
but
no
terrible
whirlpool
formed
in
the
enchanted
sea
at
last
the
boat
reached
dragondel
castle
it
stood
on
the
top
of
a
high
lonely
rock
against
whose
steep
sides
the
waves
of
the
underground
ocean
were
forever
foaming
and
breaking
and
it
was
half
in
ruins
and
was
very
poorly
lighted
the
prince
took
his
place
in
the
kitchen
and
sought
for
an
opportunity
to
prevent
the
marriage
of
dragondel
and
the
queen
for
four
days
of
the
precious
week
however
the
poor
prince
was
kept
so
busy
baking
and
making
pastries
for
the
coming
of
the
bride
that
he
did
not
have
an
instant
to
ask
questions
or
do
anything
else
in
the
morning
hours
of
the
fifth
day
there
was
a
terrible
moaning
and
roaring
outside
and
the
cooks
rushed
to
the
kitchen
windows
an
unhappy
fishing
boat
had
been
swept
by
the
wind
too
near
dragondel
castle
the
enchanted
whirlpool
had
formed
and
caught
the
boat
in
its
awful
circle
now
it
went
slowly
round
the
outer
edge
now
going
faster
and
faster
it
slid
down
the
side
of
the
awful
funnel
and
finally
it
vanished
an
instant
later
the
whirlpool
had
disappeared
leaving
the
sea
roaring
and
foaming
the
prince
shuddered
well
you
may
shudder
said
the
chief
cook
for
such
would
have
been
your
fate
if
our
master
brother
had
not
carried
with
him
the
talisman
which
rules
the
whirlpool
talisman
what
talisman
said
the
prince
affecting
stupidity
why
the
little
golden
hand
you
fool
said
the
chief
cook
my
it
must
be
a
great
big
hand
to
be
able
to
quiet
that
whirlpool
said
the
prince
big
indeed
you
ninny
growled
the
cook
why
the
magic
hand
is
only
as
big
as
a
baby
hand
i
seen
it
many
times
the
master
carries
it
in
his
pocket
and
puts
it
under
his
pillow
while
he
sleeps
so
later
on
when
his
work
was
done
and
everybody
had
gone
to
bed
the
prince
in
the
hope
of
stealing
the
talisman
tried
to
make
his
way
to
dragondel
bedchamber
but
when
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
enchanter
room
he
found
it
guarded
by
two
black
panthers
which
stared
at
him
with
insolent
yellow
eyes
and
switched
their
long
tails
the
prince
went
outdoors
to
see
if
there
was
any
hope
of
climbing
to
the
room
along
the
outer
wall
and
found
that
the
windows
of
dragondel
chamber
overlooked
a
cliff
falling
thousands
of
feet
sheer
to
the
dark
sea
far
far
away
the
prince
saw
the
glow
of
lantern
land
only
a
short
time
remained
to
him
in
which
to
save
his
beloved
lady
of
the
lanterns
as
he
wandered
about
very
sick
at
heart
he
saw
a
little
black
cat
running
madly
back
and
forth
along
the
edge
of
a
steep
cliff
from
one
of
whose
crevices
came
a
persistent
unhappy
mewing
the
poor
cat
was
a
and
was
trying
to
rescue
a
kitten
of
hers
that
had
fallen
down
between
the
rocks
at
great
risk
of
being
dashed
to
pieces
himself
the
brave
prince
climbed
down
the
precipice
rescued
the
kitten
and
gave
it
back
to
its
anxious
mother
thank
you
brave
youth
said
the
old
cat
may
it
some
day
be
within
my
power
to
help
you
as
you
have
helped
me
you
can
help
me
this
very
moment
said
the
prince
and
he
told
the
cat
who
he
was
why
he
had
come
to
the
castle
and
of
his
desire
to
get
possession
of
the
talisman
i
will
help
you
get
the
talisman
said
the
cat
the
panthers
will
let
me
pass
for
they
are
cousins
of
mine
but
you
must
make
another
little
golden
hand
to
take
the
place
of
the
one
i
shall
steal
for
if
dragondel
misses
the
golden
hand
he
will
summon
his
demons
to
find
it
and
we
shall
both
lose
our
lives
go
now
to
the
kitchen
carve
a
small
hand
with
the
fingers
close
together
and
the
thumb
lying
close
to
the
fingers
gild
it
over
with
the
gold
dust
you
have
had
given
you
for
the
pastry
icings
and
bring
it
to
me
tomorrow
night
at
this
very
hour
so
the
prince
worked
the
rest
of
the
night
carving
and
gilding
the
little
golden
hand
and
on
the
next
night
he
gave
it
to
the
cat
the
cat
took
it
in
her
mouth
as
she
would
have
a
mouse
walked
coolly
by
the
panthers
and
entered
dragondel
room
she
had
just
succeeded
in
getting
the
true
hand
out
from
under
the
magician
pillow
when
dragondel
woke
up
the
cat
was
clever
enough
to
pretend
to
be
engaged
in
a
so
the
enchanter
paid
no
attention
to
her
and
fell
asleep
once
more
when
the
cat
however
got
under
dragondel
couch
again
the
two
hands
lay
side
by
side
and
she
could
not
remember
just
which
one
was
the
talisman
and
which
one
the
false
hand
so
because
she
had
to
act
quickly
she
put
one
of
the
hands
under
the
pillow
brought
the
other
to
the
prince
and
told
him
her
story
but
so
well
matched
were
the
little
hands
that
even
the
prince
was
far
from
certain
that
he
had
not
got
his
own
hand
back
again
and
now
came
the
seventh
day
the
day
on
which
dragondel
the
blue
dog
and
all
the
wicked
enchanter
friends
were
to
sail
to
lantern
land
for
the
marriage
ceremony
the
iron
ship
made
gay
with
a
thousand
small
scarlet
lanterns
stood
ready
to
carry
them
over
the
enchanter
and
his
company
got
in
and
the
vessel
left
the
island
the
prince
stood
watching
the
ship
from
the
top
of
the
cliffs
what
anxiety
was
in
his
heart
if
dragondel
still
possessed
the
true
talisman
he
would
cross
the
whirlpool
safely
and
marry
the
beautiful
queen
of
lantern
land
the
vessel
sped
on
it
was
now
at
some
distance
from
the
island
all
is
lost
thought
the
prince
with
a
sinking
heart
dragondel
has
the
true
talisman
and
in
his
bitterness
he
was
about
to
throw
the
little
golden
hand
which
lay
in
his
pocket
down
into
the
sea
suddenly
the
air
became
filled
with
a
terrible
moaning
the
sea
became
troubled
the
whirlpool
awoke
and
the
prince
saw
the
red
lights
of
the
enchanter
ship
whirled
round
and
round
faster
and
faster
till
they
disappeared
forever
in
the
waters
of
the
sunless
sea
as
for
the
prince
he
soon
found
another
boat
and
taking
with
him
the
talisman
his
fellow
servants
and
the
black
cat
and
her
kittens
he
returned
to
lantern
land
married
the
queen
and
lived
happily
ever
after
the
adventures
of
florian
illustration
boy
walking
through
forest
following
a
small
ball
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
in
an
old
and
ruinous
house
by
the
shore
of
the
wild
sea
a
widowed
nobleman
and
his
only
child
a
daughter
named
isabella
they
were
very
poor
in
spite
of
their
high
birth
so
poor
that
one
by
one
the
fields
and
woods
of
their
little
domain
had
been
sold
in
order
to
buy
the
bare
necessities
of
life
knowing
that
his
death
would
leave
isabella
quite
alone
in
the
world
and
practically
penniless
her
father
brought
her
up
more
like
a
boy
than
a
girl
she
could
ride
a
horse
as
gracefully
as
an
amazon
she
could
swim
like
a
born
mermaid
and
even
outdo
her
father
in
his
favorite
sport
of
fencing
yet
so
sweet
was
the
gentle
nature
which
the
girl
had
inherited
from
her
mother
that
this
strange
upbringing
never
spoiled
her
in
the
least
late
one
october
evening
when
the
fierce
gusts
of
wind
from
the
sea
shook
the
old
house
to
its
very
foundation
and
set
the
ragged
tapestries
swaying
on
the
walls
isabella
father
died
leaving
her
only
the
ruinous
house
a
handful
of
copper
pence
and
a
single
golden
florin
the
sum
of
money
was
enough
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
for
a
few
weeks
but
what
was
isabella
to
do
when
the
little
pittance
was
gone
her
father
had
once
counseled
her
to
go
to
the
king
and
ask
for
his
protection
but
the
king
castle
was
hundreds
of
miles
distant
and
isabella
shrank
from
begging
or
the
highway
at
last
the
brave
girl
resolved
to
make
her
own
way
in
the
world
taking
the
golden
florin
with
her
she
went
to
a
neighboring
town
and
purchased
a
suit
of
clothes
such
as
pages
and
squires
wear
who
are
in
the
service
of
noblemen
she
then
caused
her
black
hair
to
be
cut
short
put
on
the
boy
clothes
she
had
purchased
and
went
into
the
to
see
if
she
could
not
find
a
situation
in
the
service
of
some
great
family
now
it
was
the
custom
in
those
days
for
masters
and
servants
to
meet
by
a
fountain
in
the
the
masters
who
were
in
need
of
servants
standing
on
one
side
of
the
fountain
the
servants
who
were
in
search
of
masters
on
the
other
when
isabella
came
into
the
there
was
no
one
standing
on
the
masters
side
of
the
fountain
but
on
the
other
side
ready
for
the
first
master
who
should
appear
was
a
little
group
of
noisy
and
impudent
squires
and
pages
isabella
or
as
she
now
called
herself
florian
strode
boldly
over
and
joined
this
group
her
heart
beating
high
with
the
thrill
of
the
great
adventure
suddenly
a
black
knight
mounted
on
a
black
horse
and
leading
another
horse
by
the
bridle
clattered
over
the
of
the
square
and
taking
his
place
by
the
fountain
called
on
the
pages
to
come
to
him
in
spite
of
the
horseman
summons
however
the
pages
paid
no
attention
to
him
at
all
curious
to
know
the
reason
of
this
disdain
florian
questioned
a
fellow
page
and
was
told
that
the
knight
was
no
other
than
the
enchanter
of
the
black
rock
and
that
no
page
or
squire
would
take
service
with
him
because
his
castle
was
haunted
by
goblins
ghosts
and
all
manner
of
terrifying
spirits
now
florian
was
no
coward
and
as
the
saying
is
beggars
can
not
be
choosers
so
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
pages
florian
walked
over
to
the
enchanter
who
sat
fuming
with
anger
and
impatience
and
offered
to
go
with
him
the
knight
bade
florian
mount
the
horse
which
he
was
holding
and
amid
the
and
hooting
of
the
pages
master
and
boy
galloped
away
all
day
long
they
rode
and
when
it
was
near
the
end
of
the
afternoon
florian
found
himself
at
the
edge
of
a
wild
and
desolate
moor
within
the
great
circle
of
the
horizon
under
the
pale
sky
not
a
tree
not
a
house
not
a
shepherd
hut
even
was
to
be
seen
nothing
but
the
great
barren
waste
rolling
rising
and
falling
to
the
very
edge
of
the
world
lower
and
lower
sank
the
sun
it
grew
cold
and
a
blue
mist
fell
twilight
came
a
green
mysterious
twilight
suddenly
from
a
hillock
of
the
moor
florian
beheld
afar
the
enchanted
dwelling
a
great
sunken
marsh
lay
before
him
beginning
at
the
foot
of
the
little
hill
and
stretching
away
league
after
league
till
its
farther
shore
was
hidden
in
the
gathering
darkness
the
autumn
wind
stirred
the
dead
sedges
at
its
brim
and
though
the
dying
twilight
was
still
gleaming
in
the
sky
the
great
bog
had
caught
little
of
its
glow
and
lay
full
of
coiling
blue
mists
pale
quagmires
and
islands
of
mysterious
darkness
a
dreadful
moaning
cry
uttered
by
some
demon
of
the
moor
sounded
through
the
mist
chilling
the
blood
in
veins
and
as
if
in
answer
to
the
cry
thousands
upon
thousands
of
appeared
darting
and
dancing
in
the
very
heart
of
this
terrible
marsh
a
great
black
rock
uprose
and
on
this
rock
its
turrets
and
battlements
outlined
against
the
burning
face
of
the
moon
stood
the
castle
ghostly
lights
now
green
now
blue
flickered
in
its
windows
the
enchanter
reined
up
his
horse
at
the
brink
of
the
mire
and
cried
list
list
lend
me
your
light
scarcely
had
the
last
word
fallen
from
the
enchanter
mouth
when
the
dancing
hurried
toward
him
from
all
sides
of
the
marsh
soon
a
pale
road
leading
across
the
bog
to
the
castle
stood
revealed
an
enchanted
road
which
melted
away
behind
the
riders
as
smoke
melts
into
the
winter
air
to
the
very
gates
of
his
castle
did
the
accompany
the
enchanter
then
rising
swiftly
high
into
the
air
they
fled
like
startled
birds
in
every
direction
doors
opened
of
their
own
will
strange
goblins
and
ghostly
creatures
passed
and
bright
whirling
globes
of
fire
fled
hissing
across
the
castle
courtyard
just
as
they
were
about
to
enter
the
castle
itself
the
enchanter
turned
and
fastened
his
burning
eyes
on
florian
boy
said
he
let
nothing
that
you
hear
or
see
make
you
afraid
be
assured
that
no
power
or
spirit
can
harm
you
there
is
only
one
demon
in
the
world
whose
power
is
greater
than
mine
and
that
is
fear
himself
be
brave
keep
the
doors
of
your
heart
locked
against
fear
be
faithful
and
you
shall
never
have
cause
to
regret
your
coming
so
florian
who
was
by
nature
brave
felt
ashamed
of
having
allowed
the
demon
fear
to
knock
at
the
door
of
his
heart
and
resolved
never
to
let
his
courage
fail
no
matter
what
might
happen
and
true
to
this
resolve
the
lad
remained
during
the
years
he
spent
in
the
service
of
the
enchanter
at
first
to
be
sure
he
had
to
struggle
to
conquer
his
fear
of
some
of
the
goblins
but
as
time
passed
and
no
ghost
or
goblin
ever
ventured
to
annoy
him
he
grew
accustomed
to
their
presences
and
ended
by
paying
no
more
attention
to
them
than
he
paid
to
the
great
ravens
who
flew
croaking
over
the
mire
so
faithful
and
courageous
was
the
little
page
that
when
his
year
was
up
the
enchanter
begged
him
to
remain
yet
another
year
promising
him
rich
rewards
if
he
stayed
when
this
second
year
was
up
however
florian
felt
a
longing
to
see
the
world
again
and
told
the
enchanter
that
he
must
be
going
very
well
said
the
enchanter
who
respected
the
courage
of
the
brave
page
thou
shalt
do
as
thou
desirest
thou
art
a
brave
and
faithful
lad
here
is
a
purse
of
gold
for
thy
wages
and
here
are
three
gifts
to
reward
thy
courage
and
he
opened
a
copper
casket
and
took
forth
a
little
golden
bird
with
outstretched
wings
hanging
from
a
fine
golden
chain
a
golden
key
and
a
scarlet
sphere
marked
with
a
band
of
white
this
little
bird
continued
the
enchanter
will
protect
you
from
the
spells
of
any
sorcerer
whose
power
is
less
than
mine
and
will
sing
when
you
fare
into
hidden
danger
this
key
will
open
every
door
in
the
world
and
should
you
ever
lose
your
way
you
have
but
to
put
this
sphere
on
the
ground
and
it
will
roll
home
of
its
own
accord
moreover
if
you
are
ever
yourself
in
deadly
peril
call
upon
me
and
i
will
come
and
help
you
so
florian
thanked
the
enchanter
and
taking
his
gifts
went
back
into
the
world
again
but
so
gentle
and
kind
was
he
that
he
soon
gave
away
to
the
unfortunate
all
the
gold
he
had
earned
and
was
forced
to
go
in
search
of
another
situation
at
length
he
entered
the
service
of
the
king
and
queen
of
the
twelve
towers
this
royal
couple
who
were
renowned
in
fairyland
as
much
for
their
goodness
and
generosity
as
for
their
wealth
and
magnificence
had
but
one
son
prince
florizel
no
braver
or
more
gallant
prince
ever
drew
breath
he
had
driven
the
dragon
of
the
blue
cavern
out
of
his
kingdom
he
had
fought
three
wicked
ogres
one
after
the
other
and
finished
each
one
he
had
delivered
the
diamond
castle
of
a
terrible
spell
which
lay
upon
it
when
florian
entered
the
service
of
the
king
and
queen
these
excellent
parents
were
sending
their
son
on
a
visit
to
his
uncle
the
emperor
of
the
plain
and
florian
was
ordered
to
join
the
gay
company
of
lords
and
ladies
knights
and
soldiers
who
were
to
make
the
journey
according
to
the
gossip
of
the
company
prince
florizel
was
being
sent
to
his
in
the
hope
that
he
would
fall
in
love
with
his
uncle
ward
the
beautiful
princess
rosamond
now
in
some
way
or
other
after
the
company
had
been
a
few
days
on
the
road
prince
florizel
who
watched
over
the
company
as
carefully
as
a
good
captain
does
over
his
soldiers
became
aware
of
the
bravery
trustworthiness
and
modest
bearing
of
florian
the
little
page
and
promoted
him
to
be
his
own
personal
squire
alas
no
sooner
had
he
been
advanced
than
florian
the
little
page
though
remaining
outwardly
a
page
became
at
heart
the
runaway
girl
isabella
though
she
fought
as
hard
as
she
could
against
her
own
heart
it
was
of
little
use
and
she
knew
herself
to
be
deeply
in
love
with
the
gallant
florizel
yet
she
suffered
no
word
or
sign
of
her
affection
to
escape
her
for
prince
florizel
thought
her
only
a
little
page
and
to
speak
would
be
to
betray
the
secret
she
had
so
long
and
successfully
guarded
one
morning
as
the
cavalcade
was
riding
through
a
charming
country
florian
for
so
we
must
still
continue
to
call
isabella
was
following
close
behind
his
master
when
the
prince
caught
sight
of
a
wonderful
scarlet
flower
something
like
a
scarlet
lily
blooming
by
the
roadside
at
the
same
moment
the
little
golden
bird
that
florian
wore
round
his
neck
sang
a
few
clear
notes
as
if
it
were
alive
what
a
pretty
flower
said
the
prince
i
must
have
it
and
he
was
about
to
dismount
and
pick
the
flower
when
florian
spurred
on
ahead
of
him
grasped
the
enchanted
flower
and
tossed
it
into
a
ditch
fie
what
a
naughty
page
cried
the
lords
and
ladies
the
company
rode
on
a
few
miles
more
and
suddenly
the
prince
caught
sight
of
a
beautiful
jeweled
dagger
lying
in
the
highway
at
the
same
moment
the
little
golden
bird
sang
a
few
clear
notes
of
warning
what
a
fine
dagger
cried
the
prince
i
must
have
it
and
he
was
about
to
dismount
and
pick
up
the
dagger
when
florian
spurred
on
ahead
of
him
seized
the
dagger
and
tossed
it
into
a
ditch
fie
what
a
naughty
page
cried
the
lords
and
ladies
the
company
now
rode
on
for
a
few
miles
more
and
the
prince
saw
by
the
roadside
a
beautiful
enchanted
garden
birds
of
many
colors
sang
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
fountains
sparkled
and
danced
in
the
sunlight
and
the
sweetest
of
music
was
heard
at
the
same
moment
the
golden
bird
sang
louder
and
longer
than
ever
what
a
beautiful
garden
cried
the
prince
let
us
ride
in
and
look
about
so
florian
hurried
to
the
prince
side
and
implored
him
not
to
enter
saying
that
the
garden
was
enchanted
and
that
some
harm
would
certainly
befall
him
at
this
all
the
lords
and
ladies
who
were
a
little
jealous
perhaps
that
a
page
should
know
more
than
they
laughed
at
poor
florian
and
even
florizel
smiled
at
him
and
said
all
that
is
only
fancy
little
florian
and
dashed
in
through
the
garden
gate
for
a
minute
or
so
nothing
happened
and
the
first
to
enter
mocked
at
florian
again
but
when
the
whole
company
had
entered
the
garden
there
was
a
clap
of
thunder
and
everybody
except
the
prince
and
florian
who
was
protected
by
the
enchanter
charm
was
turned
into
stone
the
echoes
of
the
thunder
had
hardly
ceased
rolling
when
two
frightful
demons
with
heads
rushed
towards
them
through
the
garden
seized
the
prince
and
hurried
him
away
florian
was
left
alone
in
the
garden
night
was
fast
approaching
now
the
owner
of
the
enchanted
garden
was
a
witch
who
had
a
daughter
so
frightfully
ugly
that
even
her
mother
powerful
magic
could
not
make
her
beautiful
in
spite
of
her
ugliness
however
the
witch
daughter
considered
herself
quite
beautiful
and
was
always
importuning
her
mother
to
invite
to
the
castle
princes
whom
she
considered
worthy
of
her
hand
so
the
old
witch
gave
wonderful
dances
and
parties
to
which
all
the
eligible
young
kings
and
princes
of
the
neighborhood
were
invited
but
just
as
soon
as
the
witch
daughter
appeared
with
a
horrid
smirk
on
her
ugly
face
the
young
men
were
sure
to
make
their
excuses
and
ride
away
at
length
the
old
witch
who
had
just
had
a
severe
from
her
daughter
for
not
punishing
the
prince
of
zagabondiga
after
that
prince
had
failed
to
ask
her
for
a
dance
could
endure
her
scolding
no
longer
and
resolved
to
catch
the
first
prince
who
came
past
her
garden
and
force
him
willy
nilly
to
accept
her
ugly
daughter
into
her
trap
poor
florizel
had
walked
and
the
witch
hoping
to
bend
him
to
her
will
by
terrifying
him
had
thrown
him
into
a
deep
dungeon
the
ugly
daughter
had
immediately
peeked
through
the
of
the
prison
and
fallen
in
love
with
florizel
at
first
sight
the
witch
was
just
considering
what
to
do
next
when
her
servitors
informed
her
that
one
of
the
company
had
resisted
her
enchantment
and
was
wandering
about
the
garden
so
the
witch
put
on
her
cloak
of
invisibility
and
going
down
to
the
garden
found
poor
florian
wandering
disconsolately
under
the
trees
she
saw
at
once
that
it
was
the
little
golden
bird
which
had
protected
him
from
her
magic
and
being
afraid
of
the
charm
and
yet
unable
to
work
the
poor
lad
any
harm
while
the
bird
was
in
his
possession
she
decided
to
rid
herself
of
florian
by
transporting
her
castle
gardens
and
all
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
so
she
uttered
a
spell
and
everything
disappeared
when
florian
woke
the
next
morning
and
found
that
the
castle
was
gone
his
heart
sank
nevertheless
he
did
not
despair
but
taking
from
his
pocket
the
little
scarlet
ball
which
his
master
the
enchanter
had
given
him
he
put
it
on
the
ground
and
bade
it
guide
him
back
to
the
enchanted
garden
the
little
ball
immediately
began
rolling
ahead
at
florian
own
pace
at
night
it
glowed
with
a
scarlet
fire
day
after
day
month
after
month
the
scarlet
ball
rolled
on
it
led
florian
over
hill
and
down
dale
through
the
land
of
the
men
who
have
only
one
eye
through
the
country
of
the
dwarfs
and
the
valley
of
the
talking
trees
never
stopping
till
it
reached
the
gate
of
the
witch
garden
a
year
meanwhile
had
gone
by
and
during
that
year
the
witch
had
done
everything
she
could
to
induce
prince
florizel
to
accept
her
ugly
daughter
first
she
had
tried
frightening
him
then
she
had
tried
to
win
him
by
giving
splendid
fetes
then
she
had
tried
terrifying
him
again
but
as
the
prince
was
neither
to
be
terrified
nor
cajoled
she
came
to
her
wits
end
finally
she
told
the
prince
that
if
he
were
not
willing
to
accept
her
daughter
in
marriage
on
the
very
next
day
she
would
turn
him
into
a
hare
and
set
her
dogs
upon
him
the
prince
made
no
answer
to
her
terrible
threat
and
the
witch
went
ahead
and
made
preparation
for
the
grandest
of
weddings
on
that
night
florian
arrived
at
the
garden
when
it
was
very
late
and
the
moon
which
was
a
quarter
full
had
disappeared
behind
a
bank
of
clouds
florian
crept
unobserved
to
the
door
of
florizel
prison
for
the
witch
had
locked
him
up
so
securely
that
she
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
find
a
watchman
alas
the
poor
prince
lay
at
the
top
of
a
high
tower
and
twenty
different
doors
each
one
opened
by
a
different
key
stood
between
him
and
the
ground
but
florian
was
not
to
be
daunted
and
drawing
from
his
bosom
the
key
which
the
enchanter
had
given
him
he
opened
one
door
after
the
other
till
he
arrived
in
the
cell
occupied
by
the
prince
the
poor
prince
lay
chained
on
a
bed
of
straw
trying
to
read
a
book
by
the
light
of
a
single
candle
he
was
very
unhappy
for
he
had
resolved
to
let
himself
be
torn
in
pieces
rather
than
marry
the
ugly
witch
maiden
you
may
be
sure
he
was
glad
to
see
florian
dear
florian
said
the
unhappy
prince
if
i
had
only
obeyed
your
counsel
all
would
have
been
well
and
he
begged
florian
to
tell
him
where
he
had
been
all
the
long
year
so
florian
told
the
prince
of
his
adventures
now
the
chains
which
the
prince
wore
were
riveted
cruelly
upon
him
and
since
there
was
no
lock
to
them
the
magic
key
was
of
no
avail
at
length
however
florizel
managed
to
work
them
off
but
in
doing
so
he
injured
his
foot
and
found
to
his
dismay
that
he
could
only
limp
along
little
by
little
the
freshened
air
and
the
stir
of
leaves
began
to
foretell
the
coming
of
the
dawn
finally
just
as
the
began
to
pale
florizel
and
florian
hurried
out
of
the
prison
through
the
twenty
doors
and
fled
to
the
highroad
but
they
had
traveled
only
a
few
miles
when
the
wicked
witch
discovered
florizel
flight
and
dreadfully
enraged
commanded
that
her
dragon
car
be
got
ready
in
order
that
she
might
go
in
pursuit
of
him
so
the
car
was
brought
forth
and
into
it
the
witch
leaped
and
mounted
into
the
sky
hearing
the
hissing
and
roaring
of
the
dragons
in
the
air
florian
and
florizel
tried
to
hide
under
some
trees
but
the
witch
instantly
saw
them
and
pronounced
a
spell
to
turn
them
into
hares
but
though
the
hate
of
the
witch
was
quick
the
woman
heart
of
isabella
was
quicker
and
sacrificing
herself
for
the
man
she
loved
she
threw
the
chain
and
the
golden
bird
over
the
prince
head
an
instant
later
she
had
turned
into
a
little
gray
hare
crouching
at
florizel
feet
at
the
same
moment
the
cruel
witch
who
had
arrived
at
her
castle
let
loose
her
pack
of
fierce
hunting
dogs
who
soon
took
up
the
trail
of
the
hare
and
came
bounding
toward
her
in
full
cry
the
poor
prince
picked
up
the
hare
and
hobbled
forward
as
fast
as
he
could
go
forgetting
the
dreadful
pain
it
caused
him
but
the
dogs
were
running
a
hundred
times
faster
than
he
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
pack
their
red
tongues
lolling
from
their
black
throats
by
good
fortune
just
as
the
leader
of
the
pack
was
not
more
than
fifty
feet
away
isabella
had
wit
enough
to
remember
the
promise
which
the
enchanter
had
made
her
and
called
upon
him
immediately
a
strong
glass
wall
as
high
as
a
castle
tower
shot
up
from
the
ground
behind
isabella
and
the
prince
and
the
pack
hurrying
forward
found
themselves
baulked
of
their
prey
snarling
and
yelling
they
threw
themselves
against
the
magic
wall
but
in
vain
in
another
instant
the
enchanter
himself
stood
before
them
and
touching
the
hare
with
his
wand
restored
isabella
to
her
human
form
she
still
wore
the
garments
of
florian
however
and
the
prince
still
thought
her
a
boy
suddenly
a
shadow
fell
on
the
ground
near
them
and
looking
up
all
beheld
the
wicked
witch
and
her
ugly
daughter
who
had
ridden
out
in
the
dragon
car
to
enjoy
florizel
cruel
death
the
enchanter
immediately
caused
the
dragon
car
to
vanish
and
the
witch
and
her
daughter
fell
tumbling
through
the
air
into
a
pond
and
were
changed
into
ugly
little
fishes
then
the
enchanter
carried
florizel
and
florian
back
to
the
witch
castle
where
they
found
the
tables
spread
and
the
dinner
being
prepared
which
was
to
celebrate
the
wedding
of
florizel
and
the
daughter
last
of
all
he
released
florizel
company
from
the
spell
now
one
of
the
ladies
when
she
heard
how
the
witch
had
tried
to
match
florizel
with
her
daughter
and
saw
the
preparations
for
the
wedding
told
the
prince
that
it
was
a
pity
that
the
princess
rosamond
were
not
at
hand
so
that
there
might
be
a
wedding
after
all
a
wedding
no
said
florizel
not
till
i
have
found
a
wife
who
shall
have
proved
herself
as
faithful
and
true
as
little
florian
she
is
already
here
said
the
enchanter
and
he
touched
florian
with
his
wand
immediately
there
was
a
flash
of
flame
and
out
of
it
florian
no
longer
but
her
own
self
appeared
isabella
her
hair
had
grown
long
again
and
the
enchanter
had
clad
her
in
the
most
magnificent
of
gowns
never
was
there
a
lovelier
girl
to
be
seen
on
earth
you
may
be
sure
that
the
prince
stepped
forward
took
her
by
the
hand
and
claimed
her
for
his
bride
soon
the
parents
of
florizel
who
had
been
summoned
by
the
enchanter
arrived
and
there
was
a
wedding
after
all
when
the
merrymaking
was
over
the
enchanter
went
back
to
his
castle
on
the
black
rock
while
florizel
and
isabella
returned
to
their
own
country
and
lived
there
happily
to
a
good
old
age
the
seller
of
dreams
once
upon
a
time
a
mother
called
her
only
son
into
the
kitchen
gave
him
a
basket
of
fine
fresh
eggs
and
bade
him
carry
them
to
his
aunt
jane
who
lived
a
few
miles
down
the
valley
the
son
a
lively
lad
about
twelve
years
of
age
obeyed
his
mother
with
joy
and
clapping
his
little
green
hat
on
his
head
stepped
forth
into
the
road
it
was
a
beautiful
clear
morning
in
the
spring
and
the
earth
released
from
the
icy
chains
of
winter
was
rejoicing
in
her
freedom
and
the
return
of
the
sun
a
few
birds
just
back
from
the
southland
rocked
on
twigs
swollen
with
bursting
buds
a
thousand
rills
flowing
from
everywhere
and
in
every
direction
sparkled
and
sang
and
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
odor
of
ploughed
fields
the
boy
whose
name
was
peter
walked
along
whistling
suddenly
he
saw
a
spot
on
the
road
shining
as
dazzlingly
as
if
a
bit
of
the
sun
itself
had
fallen
to
the
earth
a
bit
of
glass
thought
peter
but
it
was
not
a
bit
of
glass
after
all
but
a
fine
golden
florin
which
must
have
dropped
from
somebody
purse
peter
stooped
picked
up
the
gold
piece
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
walked
off
whistling
louder
than
ever
in
a
little
while
he
came
to
a
place
where
the
road
wound
down
a
little
hill
and
peter
saw
trudging
up
this
hill
a
very
strange
looking
old
man
he
was
a
very
old
man
his
face
was
puckered
up
into
a
thousand
wrinkles
like
the
skin
of
a
shrunken
apple
and
he
had
long
hair
and
a
white
beard
which
reached
almost
to
his
waist
moreover
he
was
strangely
dressed
in
a
robe
of
cherry
scarlet
and
wore
golden
shoes
from
a
kind
of
belt
hung
two
horns
on
silver
chains
one
an
ordinary
cow
horn
the
other
a
beautiful
horn
carved
of
the
whitest
ivory
and
decorated
with
little
figures
of
men
and
animals
dreams
to
sell
dreams
to
sell
called
out
the
old
man
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
peter
do
you
want
to
buy
a
dream
young
man
what
kind
of
dreams
have
you
asked
peter
good
bad
true
false
all
kinds
replied
the
seller
of
dreams
i
have
even
a
few
thrilling
nightmares
dreams
to
sell
dreams
to
sell
how
much
does
a
dream
cost
asked
peter
a
golden
florin
answered
the
merchant
i
have
one
please
said
peter
and
he
handed
over
the
florin
he
had
found
the
old
man
took
a
kind
of
wonderful
sugarplum
out
of
the
ivory
horn
and
gave
it
to
peter
to
eat
you
will
have
the
dream
next
time
you
sleep
said
he
and
trudged
on
so
peter
continued
his
journey
stopping
every
once
in
a
while
to
look
back
at
the
strange
old
man
who
was
slowly
climbing
the
hill
at
length
peter
came
to
a
little
quiet
grove
of
pines
and
there
he
sat
down
on
a
big
stone
and
ate
the
luncheon
which
his
mother
had
prepared
for
him
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
it
was
close
on
to
high
noon
now
as
peter
was
contentedly
munching
his
bread
and
cheese
he
heard
at
first
far
away
then
quite
near
at
hand
the
clear
notes
of
a
coachman
horn
the
notes
of
the
second
call
died
away
in
a
great
pattering
of
hoofs
and
tinkling
of
little
bells
and
suddenly
arriving
in
a
great
swirl
of
yellow
dust
came
a
magnificent
coach
drawn
by
twelve
white
horses
a
lady
very
richly
dressed
and
wearing
many
sparkling
diamonds
sat
within
the
coach
to
peter
astonishment
the
lady
was
his
aunt
jane
the
coach
stopped
with
a
great
jingling
of
the
twelve
harnesses
and
aunt
jane
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
said
to
peter
what
are
you
doing
here
child
i
was
on
my
way
to
your
cottage
with
a
basket
of
fine
fresh
eggs
answered
peter
well
it
fortunate
i
found
you
said
aunt
jane
for
i
have
given
up
living
in
the
cottage
and
have
now
got
a
castle
of
my
own
jump
in
peter
and
do
forget
your
basket
so
peter
climbed
into
the
coach
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
was
driven
away
the
coach
went
over
hill
and
down
dale
it
went
through
strange
forests
from
whose
branches
green
parrots
whooped
and
shrieked
it
rolled
through
valleys
in
strange
shining
mountains
peter
stole
a
look
at
aunt
jane
and
saw
that
she
was
wearing
a
crown
are
you
a
queen
aunt
jane
he
asked
indeed
i
am
replied
his
aunt
you
see
peter
two
days
ago
while
i
was
looking
for
my
white
cow
who
had
strayed
away
i
came
upon
the
magnificent
castle
to
which
we
are
now
going
it
has
four
beautiful
towers
and
a
door
set
with
diamonds
castle
is
this
i
said
to
the
nobody
marm
said
he
said
i
you
mean
to
say
that
nobody
owns
this
fine
castle
just
what
i
mean
to
say
marm
answered
he
castle
belongs
to
anyone
who
wants
it
so
into
the
castle
i
walked
and
i
did
go
out
you
may
be
sure
till
i
had
been
into
every
room
that
i
could
find
then
i
put
on
these
clothes
and
these
diamonds
which
i
found
in
a
cupboard
and
went
down
and
told
the
servants
i
intended
to
be
queen
you
see
peter
dear
there
nothing
that
a
woman
of
determination
and
energy
accomplish
the
coach
rolled
on
and
soon
peter
caught
sight
of
aunt
jane
castle
it
was
rather
large
and
had
an
enormous
round
tower
at
each
corner
a
thing
which
brought
to
peter
mind
the
picture
of
an
elephant
lying
on
its
back
peter
and
aunt
jane
accompanied
by
a
train
of
servants
dressed
in
livery
walked
into
the
castle
through
the
door
do
you
think
you
could
eat
a
little
more
of
something
said
aunt
jane
taking
off
her
gloves
because
if
you
can
i
have
a
place
set
for
you
at
the
luncheon
table
and
peter
who
like
all
boys
could
eat
a
little
more
anywhere
and
at
any
time
readily
answered
yes
so
peter
and
aunt
jane
sat
down
to
a
wonderful
little
table
covered
with
a
cloth
draw
your
chair
nearer
peter
dear
said
aunt
jane
i
ca
said
peter
it
stuck
to
the
floor
and
so
it
was
the
chair
was
stuck
to
the
floor
and
no
amount
of
pushing
or
pulling
could
budge
it
that
odd
said
aunt
jane
but
never
mind
i
push
the
table
over
to
the
chair
but
like
the
chair
the
table
refused
to
budge
peter
then
tried
to
slide
his
plate
of
soup
closer
to
him
but
the
plate
which
the
servant
had
placed
on
the
cloth
but
an
instant
before
had
evidently
frozen
to
the
table
in
some
extraordinary
manner
and
could
not
be
moved
an
inch
the
soup
in
the
plate
however
was
not
fastened
to
the
dish
nor
were
the
wonderful
and
the
delicious
ices
with
which
the
dinner
closed
you
do
suppose
this
castle
is
enchanted
do
you
aunt
jane
asked
peter
not
a
bit
of
it
replied
aunt
jane
and
even
if
it
were
she
continued
recklessly
i
should
mind
for
there
nothing
that
a
woman
of
determination
and
energy
ca
accomplish
there
was
a
pause
and
then
aunt
jane
added
i
am
going
to
have
some
guests
to
dinner
this
evening
so
run
round
and
amuse
yourself
as
well
as
you
can
ever
so
much
to
see
in
the
castle
and
in
the
garden
there
a
pond
with
swans
in
it
attended
by
her
servants
aunt
jane
majestically
walked
away
peter
spent
the
afternoon
exploring
the
castle
he
went
through
room
after
room
he
scurried
through
the
attics
like
a
mouse
and
was
even
lost
for
a
while
in
the
cellars
and
everywhere
he
went
he
found
everything
immovable
the
beds
tables
and
chairs
could
neither
be
moved
about
nor
lifted
up
and
even
the
clocks
and
vases
were
mysteriously
fastened
to
their
places
on
the
shelves
the
night
came
on
coach
after
coach
rolled
up
to
the
diamond
door
which
sparkled
in
the
moonlight
when
the
guests
had
all
arrived
a
silver
trumpet
sounded
and
aunt
jane
dressed
in
a
wonderful
gown
of
flowering
brocade
edged
with
pearls
came
solemnly
down
the
great
stairway
of
the
castle
hall
two
little
black
boys
dressed
in
oriental
costume
and
wearing
turbans
held
up
her
gorgeous
train
and
she
looked
very
grand
indeed
peter
to
his
great
surprise
found
himself
dressed
in
a
wonderful
suit
of
velvet
welcome
my
friends
said
queen
jane
who
had
opened
a
wonderful
fan
are
we
not
fortunate
in
having
so
beautiful
a
night
for
our
dinner
and
the
queen
giving
her
arm
to
a
splendid
personage
in
the
uniform
of
an
officer
of
the
king
dragoons
led
the
way
to
the
the
wonderful
party
all
silks
and
satins
and
gleaming
with
jewels
swept
like
a
peacock
tail
behind
her
soon
dinner
was
over
and
the
guests
began
to
stray
by
twos
and
threes
to
the
ballroom
aunt
jane
and
the
soldier
led
off
the
grand
march
then
came
wonderful
stately
minuets
quadrilles
and
sweet
waltzes
the
merriment
was
at
its
height
when
somebody
ran
heavily
up
the
great
stairs
leading
to
the
ballroom
and
the
guests
turning
round
to
see
whence
came
the
clatter
saw
standing
in
the
doorway
a
strange
old
man
dressed
in
a
robe
of
cherry
scarlet
and
wearing
golden
shoes
it
was
the
seller
of
dreams
his
white
hair
was
disheveled
his
robe
was
awry
and
there
was
dust
on
his
golden
shoes
foolish
people
screamed
the
old
seller
of
dreams
his
voice
rising
to
a
shriek
run
your
lives
this
castle
lies
under
a
terrible
enchantment
in
a
few
minutes
it
will
turn
have
you
not
seen
that
everything
is
fastened
to
the
floor
run
for
your
lives
immediately
there
was
a
great
babble
of
voices
some
shrieks
and
more
confusion
and
the
guests
ran
down
the
great
stairs
and
out
the
castle
door
to
peter
dismay
aunt
jane
was
not
among
them
so
into
the
castle
he
rushed
again
calling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
aunt
jane
aunt
jane
he
ran
through
the
brilliantly
lit
and
deserted
ballroom
he
saw
himself
running
in
the
great
mirrors
of
the
gallery
aunt
jane
he
cried
but
no
aunt
jane
replied
peter
rushed
up
the
stairs
leading
to
the
castle
tower
and
emerged
upon
the
balcony
he
saw
the
black
shadow
of
the
castle
thrown
upon
the
grass
far
below
by
the
full
moon
he
saw
the
great
forest
so
bright
above
and
so
dark
and
mysterious
below
and
the
long
range
of
the
adamant
mountains
suddenly
a
voice
louder
than
the
voice
of
any
human
being
a
voice
deep
ringing
and
solemn
as
the
sound
of
a
great
bell
cried
is
time
immediately
everything
became
as
black
as
ink
people
shrieked
the
enchanted
castle
rolled
like
a
ship
at
sea
and
leaning
far
to
one
side
began
to
turn
peter
felt
the
floor
of
the
balcony
tip
beneath
him
he
tried
to
catch
hold
of
something
but
could
find
nothing
suddenly
with
a
scream
he
fell
he
was
falling
falling
falling
falling
falling
when
peter
came
to
himself
instead
of
its
being
night
it
was
still
noonday
and
he
was
sitting
on
the
same
stone
in
the
same
quiet
roadside
grove
from
which
he
had
caught
sight
of
his
aunt
jane
in
her
wonderful
coach
a
blue
jay
screamed
at
him
from
overhead
for
aunt
jane
the
coach
and
the
enchanted
castle
had
been
only
a
dream
peter
you
see
had
fallen
asleep
under
the
pines
and
while
he
slept
he
had
dreamed
the
dream
he
purchased
from
the
seller
of
dreams
very
glad
to
be
still
alive
peter
rubbed
his
eyes
took
up
his
basket
of
eggs
and
went
down
the
road
whistling
illustration
old
man
and
boy
in
the
forest
how
much
does
a
dream
cost
asked
peter
a
golden
florin
answered
the
seller
of
dreams
the
treasure
castle
illustration
three
men
in
a
flying
castle
tower
once
upon
a
time
a
hunter
was
roaming
through
the
wildwood
when
he
heard
a
voice
crying
piteously
for
aid
following
the
sound
the
hunter
plunged
ahead
and
discovered
a
dwarf
caught
in
a
pit
which
had
been
dug
to
trap
wild
animals
after
the
hunter
had
rescued
the
dwarf
from
his
prison
the
little
man
said
to
him
go
ten
leagues
to
the
north
till
you
arrive
at
a
gigantic
pine
then
turn
to
the
east
and
go
ten
leagues
more
till
you
come
to
a
black
castle
enter
the
castle
without
fear
and
you
will
discover
a
round
room
in
which
stands
a
round
ebony
table
laden
with
gold
and
jewels
help
yourself
to
the
treasure
and
return
home
at
once
and
do
not
now
mark
me
well
go
up
into
the
turret
of
the
castle
for
if
you
do
evil
will
come
of
it
so
the
hunter
thanked
the
dwarf
and
after
making
sure
that
he
had
plenty
of
bread
and
cheese
in
his
knapsack
hurried
northwards
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
through
bramble
and
brier
through
valley
and
wooded
dale
went
he
and
at
dusk
he
came
to
a
gigantic
pine
standing
solitary
in
a
rocky
field
wearied
with
his
long
journey
the
hunter
lay
down
beneath
the
pine
and
slept
when
it
was
dawn
he
woke
refreshed
and
turning
his
eyes
toward
the
level
rays
of
the
rising
sun
began
his
journey
to
the
east
presently
he
reached
a
height
in
the
forest
and
from
this
height
he
saw
not
very
far
away
a
black
turret
rising
over
the
ocean
of
bright
leaves
at
high
noon
he
arrived
at
the
castle
it
was
ruinous
and
quite
deserted
grass
grew
in
the
courtyard
and
between
the
bricks
of
the
terrace
and
the
oaken
door
was
as
soft
and
rotten
as
a
log
that
has
long
been
buried
in
mire
entering
the
castle
the
hunter
soon
discovered
the
round
room
a
table
laden
with
wonderful
treasures
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
chamber
directly
under
a
shower
of
sunlight
pouring
through
a
window
in
the
mildewed
wall
how
the
diamonds
and
precious
stones
sparkled
and
gleamed
now
while
the
hunter
was
filling
his
pockets
the
flash
of
a
jewel
lying
on
the
floor
happened
to
catch
his
eye
and
looking
down
he
saw
that
a
kind
of
trail
of
jewels
lay
along
the
floor
leading
out
of
the
room
following
the
scattered
gems
which
had
the
appearance
of
having
been
spilled
from
some
heaped
too
high
the
hunter
came
to
a
low
door
and
opening
this
door
he
discovered
a
flight
of
stone
steps
leading
to
the
turret
the
steps
were
strewn
carelessly
with
the
finest
emeralds
topazes
beryls
moonstones
rubies
and
crystal
diamonds
remembering
the
counsel
of
his
friend
the
dwarf
however
the
hunter
did
not
go
up
the
stairs
but
hurried
home
with
his
treasure
when
the
hunter
returned
to
his
country
the
wonderful
treasures
which
he
had
taken
from
the
castle
in
the
wood
made
him
a
very
rich
man
and
in
a
short
time
the
news
of
his
prosperity
came
to
the
ears
of
the
king
this
king
was
the
wickedest
of
rogues
and
his
two
best
friends
the
chamberlain
and
the
chancellor
were
every
bit
as
unscrupulous
as
he
they
oppressed
the
people
with
taxes
they
stole
from
the
poor
they
robbed
the
churches
indeed
there
was
no
injustice
which
they
were
not
ready
to
commit
so
when
the
chamberlain
heard
of
the
hunter
wealth
he
being
a
direct
straightforward
rascal
declared
that
the
simplest
thing
to
do
would
be
to
kill
the
hunter
and
take
his
money
the
chancellor
who
was
somewhat
more
cunning
and
worldly
declared
that
it
would
be
better
to
throw
the
hunter
into
a
foul
dark
dungeon
till
he
was
ready
to
buy
his
freedom
with
all
his
wealth
the
king
who
was
the
wickedest
and
wisest
of
the
precious
three
declared
that
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
find
out
whence
the
hunter
had
got
his
treasure
so
that
if
there
happened
to
be
any
left
they
could
go
and
get
it
then
of
course
they
could
kill
the
hunter
and
take
his
treasure
too
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
by
a
royal
order
the
hunter
was
thrown
into
a
horrible
prison
and
told
that
his
only
hope
of
release
lay
in
revealing
the
origin
of
his
riches
so
after
he
had
been
slowly
starved
and
cruelly
beaten
he
told
of
the
treasure
castle
in
the
wood
on
the
following
morning
the
king
the
chamberlain
and
the
chancellor
taking
with
them
some
strong
linen
bags
and
some
pack
mules
rode
forth
in
quest
of
the
treasure
great
was
their
joy
when
they
found
the
treasure
castle
and
the
treasure
room
just
as
the
hunter
had
described
the
chancellor
poured
the
shining
gems
through
his
fingers
and
the
king
and
the
chamberlain
threw
their
arms
around
each
shoulders
and
danced
a
jig
as
well
as
their
age
and
dignity
would
permit
the
first
fine
careless
rapture
over
they
began
pouring
the
treasure
into
the
linen
sacks
they
had
brought
with
them
and
these
filled
to
the
brim
they
carried
to
the
castle
door
soon
not
the
tiniest
gem
was
left
on
the
table
suddenly
the
chamberlain
happened
to
catch
sight
of
the
gems
strewn
along
the
floor
see
see
he
cried
his
voice
shrill
and
greedy
there
is
yet
more
to
be
had
so
the
three
rogues
got
down
on
their
hands
and
knees
and
began
stuffing
the
stray
jewels
into
their
bulging
pockets
the
trail
of
jewels
led
them
across
the
hall
to
the
little
door
opening
on
the
stairway
and
up
this
stairway
they
scrambled
as
fast
as
they
could
go
at
the
top
of
the
stair
in
the
turret
they
found
another
round
room
lit
by
three
narrow
barred
windows
and
in
the
centre
of
this
turret
chamber
likewise
laden
with
gold
and
jewels
they
found
another
ebony
table
with
shrieks
of
delight
the
king
and
the
chancellor
and
the
chamberlain
ran
to
this
second
treasure
and
plunged
their
hands
in
the
glittering
golden
mass
suddenly
a
great
bell
rang
in
the
castle
a
great
brazen
bell
whose
deep
clang
beat
about
them
in
throbbing
singing
waves
what
that
said
the
three
rogues
in
one
breath
and
rushed
together
to
the
door
it
was
locked
an
instant
later
there
was
a
heavy
explosion
which
threw
them
all
to
the
floor
tossing
the
treasure
over
them
and
then
wonder
of
wonders
the
castle
turret
with
the
three
rogues
imprisoned
in
it
detached
itself
from
the
rest
of
the
castle
and
flew
off
into
the
air
from
the
barred
windows
the
king
the
chamberlain
and
the
chancellor
saw
league
upon
league
of
the
forest
rushing
by
beneath
them
suddenly
the
flying
room
began
to
descend
swiftly
and
landed
lightly
as
a
bird
in
the
middle
of
a
castle
courtyard
fellows
with
human
bodies
and
heads
of
horses
came
rushing
toward
the
enchanted
turret
and
seized
its
prisoners
in
a
few
moments
they
were
brought
before
the
king
to
whom
the
treasure
belonged
now
this
king
was
a
brother
of
the
dwarf
whom
the
hunter
had
rescued
from
the
pit
he
had
a
little
gold
crown
on
his
head
and
sat
on
a
little
golden
throne
with
cushions
of
crimson
velvet
with
what
are
these
three
charged
said
the
with
having
tried
to
rob
the
treasure
castle
your
majesty
replied
one
of
the
servitors
in
a
firm
stable
tone
then
send
for
the
lord
chief
justice
at
once
said
the
the
three
culprits
were
left
standing
uneasily
in
a
kind
of
cage
they
would
have
tried
to
speak
but
every
time
they
opened
their
mouths
one
of
the
guards
gave
them
a
dig
in
the
ribs
for
a
space
of
five
minutes
there
was
quiet
in
the
crowded
a
quiet
broken
now
and
then
by
a
veiled
cough
or
the
noise
of
shuffling
feet
presently
from
far
away
came
the
clear
sweet
call
of
silver
trumpets
he
coming
he
coming
murmured
many
voices
a
buzz
of
excitement
filled
the
room
several
people
had
to
be
revived
with
smelling
salts
the
trumpets
sounded
a
second
time
the
excitement
increased
the
trumpets
sounded
a
third
time
near
at
hand
a
man
voice
announced
in
solemn
tones
the
lord
chief
justice
approaches
the
audience
grew
very
still
hardly
a
rustle
or
a
flutter
was
heard
suddenly
the
great
tapestry
curtains
which
overhung
the
door
parted
and
there
appeared
first
of
all
an
usher
clad
in
red
velvet
and
carrying
a
golden
wand
then
came
two
pages
also
clad
in
red
velvet
and
carrying
a
flat
box
on
a
velvet
cushion
last
of
all
came
an
elderly
man
dressed
in
black
and
carrying
a
golden
perch
on
which
sat
a
fine
green
parrot
on
reaching
the
centre
of
the
hall
the
parrot
flapped
its
wings
arranged
an
upstart
feather
or
two
and
then
resumed
that
solemn
dignity
for
which
birds
and
animals
are
so
justly
famous
with
great
ceremony
the
gentleman
in
black
placed
the
lord
chief
justice
on
a
lacquer
stand
close
by
the
throne
of
the
trumpets
sounded
two
servitors
hurried
forward
with
the
captive
king
your
venerability
spoke
the
to
the
parrot
who
watched
him
intently
out
of
its
round
yellow
eye
and
nodded
its
head
this
rascal
has
been
taken
in
the
act
of
robbing
the
treasure
castle
what
punishment
do
you
suggest
at
these
words
the
two
pages
advancing
with
immense
solemnity
lifted
the
lacquer
box
to
within
reach
of
the
parrot
beak
the
box
was
full
of
cards
over
them
swaying
from
one
leg
to
the
other
as
he
did
so
the
parrot
swept
his
head
an
icy
silence
fell
over
the
throng
the
king
the
chancellor
and
the
chamberlain
quaked
in
their
shoes
presently
the
parrot
picked
out
a
card
and
the
gentleman
in
black
handed
it
to
the
prisoner
said
the
to
the
other
king
the
lord
chief
justice
condemns
you
to
be
for
the
rest
of
your
natural
life
master
sweeper
of
the
palace
chimneys
discreet
applause
was
heard
the
chancellor
was
then
hurried
forward
and
the
bird
picked
out
a
second
card
prisoner
said
the
the
lord
chief
justice
condemns
you
to
be
for
the
rest
of
your
natural
life
master
washer
of
the
palace
windows
more
discreet
applause
was
heard
and
now
the
chamberlain
was
brought
to
the
bar
the
parrot
gave
him
quite
a
wicked
eye
and
hesitated
for
some
time
before
drawing
a
card
prisoner
said
the
reading
the
card
which
the
parrot
had
finally
chosen
the
lord
chief
justice
condemns
you
for
the
rest
of
your
natural
life
to
be
master
beater
of
the
palace
carpets
great
applause
followed
this
sage
judgment
so
the
three
rogues
were
led
away
and
unless
you
have
heard
to
the
contrary
they
are
still
making
up
for
their
wicked
lives
by
enforced
diligence
at
their
tasks
the
palace
has
five
hundred
and
chimneys
eight
thousand
seven
hundred
and
windows
and
eleven
hundred
and
large
carpets
and
the
chimneys
windows
and
carpets
have
to
be
swept
washed
and
beaten
at
least
once
a
week
now
when
the
king
the
chancellor
and
the
chamberlain
failed
to
return
the
people
took
the
hunter
out
of
his
prison
and
made
him
king
because
he
was
the
richest
and
most
powerful
of
them
all
as
for
the
treasure
of
the
treasure
castle
it
is
still
there
packed
in
the
linen
sacks
lying
just
inside
the
great
door
perhaps
some
day
you
may
find
it
if
you
do
do
be
greedy
and
go
up
to
the
turret
chamber

into
an

chest
once
upon
a
time
a
king
and
a
queen
gave
a
magnificent
party
in
honor
of
the
christening
of
their
son
prince
rolandor
to
this
party
the
royal
parents
took
good
care
to
invite
every
single
fairy
in
fairyland
for
they
knew
very
well
the
unhappy
consequences
of
forgetting
to
invite
fairies
to
christenings
when
all
the
invitations
had
been
sent
out
the
queen
went
down
to
the
kitchen
to
superintend
the
cooking
of
the
of
the
feast
a
huge
the
morning
on
which
the
grand
ceremony
was
to
take
place
arrived
at
ten
the
court
astrologer
who
was
master
of
ceremonies
gave
the
order
to
form
in
line
and
at
ten
minutes
to
eleven
the
splendid
procession
started
for
the
church
the
road
was
lined
with
the
vassals
shouting
hurrah
hurrah
countless
little
elves
with
gauzy
wings
watched
from
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
the
great
cathedral
bells
went
clang
bang
clang
as
merrily
as
could
be
just
behind
the
royal
came
the
king
coach
shining
in
the
sunlight
of
june
with
the
king
and
the
queen
in
it
on
one
side
and
the
court
astrologer
and
the
fairy
titania
prospective
godparents
of
the
little
prince
on
the
other
the
prince
himself
swathed
in
a
wonderful
silk
mantle
edged
with
pearls
and
turquoises
slept
in
the
astrologer
arms
the
procession
entered
the
church
where
the
venerable
lord
archbishop
surrounded
by
a
magnificent
choir
was
awaiting
its
coming
a
hush
went
over
the
great
assembly
as
the
parents
and
the
godparents
advanced
to
the
font
and
the
silence
lasted
until
his
eminence
had
sprinkled
the
prince
and
given
him
the
name
of
rolandor
then
the
bells
rang
again
the
organ
roared
so
that
the
windows
shook
in
their
casements
and
the
choristers
sang
like
birds
on
a
summer
afternoon
the
christening
over
the
procession
went
back
to
the
castle
past
the
waiting
rows
of
bystanders
not
one
of
whom
had
changed
his
place
or
gone
away
so
superb
had
been
the
spectacle
the
christening
banquet
was
laid
in
the
great
hall
of
the
castle
and
thanks
to
the
court
astrologer
things
went
off
beautifully
it
was
the
only
large
banquet
ever
known
in
the
history
of
the
world
where
courses
were
served
all
at
one
time
and
while
one
person
was
finishing
an
ice
another
was
not
beginning
with
the
soup
nor
was
the
menu
mixed
which
happens
so
frequently
that
you
are
apt
to
have
soup
ice
cake
roast
soup
and
a
roast
again
no
from
soup
to
ice
the
banquet
was
a
huge
success
but
alas
disaster
came
with
the
as
the
queen
was
chatting
with
the
lord
chancellor
of
the
enchanted
islands
she
happened
to
notice
for
like
a
good
hostess
she
had
been
keeping
an
eye
to
the
comfort
of
her
guests
that
nobody
on
the
side
of
the
hall
had
been
served
with
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
chief
cook
looking
rather
pale
and
worried
bustled
through
the
throng
and
whispered
in
her
ear
your
majesty
the
has
given
out
the
queen
turned
pale
at
length
she
managed
to
ask
in
a
weak
voice
have
you
plenty
of
other
pastries
yes
your
majesty
replied
the
cook
then
let
them
be
served
at
once
the
cook
withdrew
and
the
queen
though
somewhat
shaken
took
up
the
conversation
again
ten
minutes
passed
and
she
was
beginning
to
forget
her
start
when
a
voice
rising
clear
and
rasping
over
the
hubbub
of
the
hall
said
suddenly
where
my
piece
of
everybody
turned
toward
the
speaker
an
elderly
fairy
from
the
kingdom
of
the
black
mountains
named
malvolia
she
stood
up
in
her
place
her
arms
akimbo
glowering
at
her
plate
on
which
an
attendant
had
just
deposited
a
small
chocolate
eclair
where
my
piece
of
she
repeated
the
queen
rose
i
am
very
sorry
madam
malvolia
said
she
in
her
sweetest
voice
but
the
has
given
out
answered
malvolia
rudely
you
mean
that
you
only
baked
enough
for
your
own
personal
friends
at
this
several
guests
cried
sh
sh
and
the
king
began
to
look
worried
we
will
send
for
some
at
once
announced
his
majesty
oh
yes
baked
by
the
queen
own
hands
for
her
own
dear
friends
said
malvolia
sneeringly
but
for
me
a
fairy
of
age
and
distinction
an
ordinary
low
baker
eclair
the
kingdom
of
the
black
mountains
has
been
deliberately
insulted
in
my
person
no
no
no
no
cried
the
king
and
the
queen
we
assure
you
madam
that
it
was
a
simple
mischance
pish
and
tush
replied
malvolia
who
like
a
great
many
people
secretly
enjoyed
feeling
herself
aggrieved
i
consider
the
affair
an
affront
a
deliberate
affront
and
you
shall
pay
dear
for
this
humiliation
she
screamed
quickly
losing
control
of
her
temper
every
time
the
prince
sneezes
something
shall
change
until
at
this
very
moment
alas
a
northeast
wind
blew
gustily
through
the
open
windows
of
the
hall
shaking
the
tapestries
from
the
walls
and
carrying
away
the
last
of
malvolia
sentence
the
angry
fairy
turned
herself
into
a
great
black
raven
and
flew
cawing
hoarsely
over
the
heads
of
the
banqueters
and
out
of
the
window
with
the
wind
a
baby
cry
was
heard
and
the
king
and
the
queen
rushed
to
where
their
little
son
lay
in
his
cradle
on
a
raised
platform
at
the
head
of
the
hall
the
little
prince
fat
pink
face
was
twisted
into
dreadful
lines
he
opened
his
mouth
wide
several
times
and
half
closed
it
again
then
opening
it
wider
than
ever
he
sneezed
a
terrible
sneeze
there
came
a
loud
clap
of
thunder
when
the
confusion
was
over
the
court
astrologer
was
found
to
have
turned
into
an
clock
with
a
sun
moon
and
stars
arrangement
a
planetary
indicator
and
a
calendar
calculated
for
two
thousand
years
the
banquet
ended
rather
gloomily
although
the
gifts
of
the
other
fairies
such
as
health
wealth
and
beauty
managed
to
make
everyone
a
little
more
cheerful
when
the
guests
were
gone
the
king
and
queen
sent
for
doctor
pill
the
court
physician
to
consult
him
in
regard
to
the
measures
which
ought
to
be
taken
to
prevent
the
prince
sneezing
as
for
the
poor
court
astrologer
he
was
hung
up
in
the
sacristy
of
the
cathedral
and
every
eight
days
his
wife
wound
him
up
with
tears
what
shall
we
do
doctor
asked
the
king
rather
mournfully
the
prince
must
be
preserved
from
the
things
which
cause
sneezing
said
the
doctor
sagely
such
as
draughts
suggested
the
king
draughts
snuff
and
pepper
answered
the
leech
let
his
little
highness
be
put
into
a
special
suite
of
rooms
admit
no
person
to
them
until
he
has
been
examined
for
and
has
put
on
garments
and
as
his
little
highness
grows
older
forbid
the
use
of
pepper
in
his
food
better
still
if
your
majesty
has
a
castle
in
the
mountains
let
the
prince
be
taken
there
for
the
sake
of
the
purer
air
there
is
the
tower
on
the
golden
mountain
said
the
king
at
this
the
queen
began
to
weep
again
for
she
quite
naturally
did
not
wish
to
part
with
her
child
but
my
dear
we
ca
have
him
sneezing
and
things
changing
all
the
time
said
the
king
i
beg
your
majesty
to
consider
the
danger
of
a
put
in
the
doctor
yes
think
of
the
danger
of
a
echoed
the
king
who
saw
clearer
than
the
queen
the
chaos
that
might
result
if
the
prince
was
attacked
by
a
prolonged
fit
of
sneezing
people
with
may
sneeze
ten
or
fifteen
times
a
day
or
fifty
said
the
doctor
or
fifty
echoed
the
king
again
shaking
his
head
for
he
was
torn
between
paternal
love
and
kingly
duty
imagine
fifty
enchantments
in
a
day
by
eventide
the
whole
kingdom
would
be
upset
undone
and
the
people
plotting
a
revolution
the
tower
on
the
golden
mountain
is
in
a
fine
healthful
locality
said
the
doctor
and
the
prince
could
be
brought
up
as
happily
there
as
in
the
palace
so
at
length
the
queen
consented
in
a
few
days
the
little
prince
who
had
not
sneezed
a
second
time
was
removed
to
the
tower
on
the
golden
mountain
his
room
designed
by
doctor
pill
was
completely
protected
from
draughts
and
every
breath
of
air
that
entered
it
was
mrs
pill
who
had
been
a
hospital
nurse
took
care
of
him
three
times
a
week
on
mondays
wednesdays
and
fridays
his
royal
parents
rode
out
to
the
tower
and
after
putting
on
garments
were
admitted
to
the
nursery
of
their
infant
son
and
so
the
years
went
by
nobody
was
found
able
to
break
spell
and
the
clue
to
its
undoing
had
been
carried
away
by
the
wind
malvolia
herself
had
disappeared
the
prince
became
a
handsome
little
boy
accomplished
teachers
taught
him
history
music
drawing
dancing
and
all
the
other
things
that
a
prince
ought
to
know
but
of
real
life
he
knew
almost
nothing
at
all
his
most
faithful
friend
during
these
lonely
years
was
a
french
poodle
who
spoke
both
french
and
english
exceedingly
well
of
course
he
had
a
marked
canine
accent
rather
growling
his
g
and
howling
the
aw
and
the
ow
but
his
words
were
well
chosen
and
his
vocabulary
extensive
never
was
seen
a
more
friendly
wise
and
devoted
animal
when
the
king
decided
to
have
him
sent
away
for
a
while
for
he
feared
that
his
son
was
getting
a
touch
of
poldo
barky
manner
of
speaking
from
too
close
an
association
the
little
prince
became
really
ill
from
grief
and
the
king
was
forced
to
alter
his
decision
during
his
imprisonment
in
the
tower
in
spite
of
all
precautions
the
prince
sneezed
three
times
at
the
first
sneeze
all
the
dogs
in
the
kingdom
except
poldo
changed
into
cats
and
all
the
cats
into
dogs
though
this
was
not
a
serious
trouble
the
change
was
certainly
inconvenient
all
the
came
out
meowing
at
people
as
the
dogs
used
to
bark
at
them
and
they
chased
people
down
the
street
the
on
the
other
hand
stayed
in
the
kitchen
under
the
stove
and
watched
for
mice
in
the
pantry
great
bernards
might
be
seen
licking
their
paws
and
rubbing
them
over
their
foreheads
and
fat
old
used
to
try
to
purr
at
the
second
sneeze
all
the
elderly
gentlemen
over
seventy
changed
into
elm
trees
a
proceeding
that
caused
a
terrible
lot
of
trouble
at
the
third
sneeze
all
the
people
in
the
pictures
at
the
art
museum
became
alive
and
for
a
week
the
soldiers
of
the
royal
guard
spent
most
of
their
time
rescuing
poor
bewildered
fauns
satyrs
nymphs
roman
senators
and
long
dead
celebrities
and
historical
personages
from
the
worst
destitution
the
king
finally
had
to
build
a
special
castle
for
them
as
the
prince
birthday
drew
near
he
began
to
feel
very
sad
at
the
idea
of
having
to
stay
shut
up
in
the
tower
all
his
life
though
he
was
a
very
brave
and
very
manly
young
man
he
lay
down
on
his
couch
and
wept
in
sorrow
suddenly
standing
with
his
forepaws
on
the
coverlet
why
do
you
weep
dear
master
said
the
little
dog
at
my
fate
replied
the
poor
prince
i
can
not
bear
to
think
that
i
may
have
to
spend
all
my
days
in
this
tower
and
never
see
the
great
wide
world
the
poodle
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
at
length
he
said
dear
prince
rolandor
do
not
give
up
hope
have
you
ever
thought
of
consulting
my
old
master
the
giant
of
the
north
pole
he
has
a
large
chest
in
his
palace
full
of
secrets
which
the
winds
have
overheard
and
perhaps
the
key
to
malvolia
spell
is
among
them
if
you
will
have
a
warm
fur
coat
and
four
fur
boots
made
for
me
i
will
go
to
the
giant
and
ask
him
the
prince
gave
his
consent
and
on
the
next
day
the
royal
tailor
made
the
poodle
a
magnificent
sealskin
coat
and
four
splendid
boots
then
the
king
wished
him
good
speed
the
queen
cried
over
him
and
the
prince
who
could
see
from
his
high
tower
every
corner
of
the
kingdom
watched
him
till
he
disappeared
over
the
hills
and
far
away
straight
north
the
poodle
ran
soon
he
had
left
the
fertile
plains
behind
him
and
entered
great
black
pine
forests
where
never
a
road
was
to
be
seen
the
cold
wind
howled
through
the
trees
and
at
night
the
brilliant
stars
sparkled
over
the
dark
and
waving
branches
hungry
wolves
and
savage
bears
often
pursued
him
but
somehow
he
always
managed
to
escape
them
all
at
the
end
of
the
forest
he
found
the
frozen
ocean
lit
by
the
shuddering
light
of
the
aurora
flashing
in
a
great
fan
from
east
to
west
past
walruses
and
sleepy
penguins
he
flew
till
on
the
eleventh
day
he
saw
the
green
icy
pinnacles
of
the
palace
against
the
waving
curtain
of
the
polar
lights
on
the
evening
of
the
twelfth
day
he
entered
the
castle
the
giant
of
the
north
pole
was
a
tall
strong
fellow
wearing
a
crown
of
ice
and
a
great
sweeping
mantle
made
from
the
white
fur
of
the
polar
bear
his
servants
were
the
gusts
strange
supple
shadowy
creatures
moving
quickly
to
and
fro
and
his
courtiers
were
the
whirlwinds
and
the
storms
the
giant
wife
sat
by
his
side
she
had
dark
hair
and
eyes
of
icy
burning
blue
welcome
little
poldo
said
the
giant
and
his
voice
sounded
like
the
wind
in
the
treetops
what
seek
you
here
i
seek
some
words
of
the
fairy
malvolia
which
were
carried
away
by
the
northeast
wind
at
prince
rolandor
christening
replied
the
poodle
whew
whistled
the
giant
of
the
north
pole
if
i
have
them
the
words
are
yours
he
summoned
two
gusts
to
bring
forth
the
chest
of
secrets
it
was
made
of
black
stone
and
edged
with
diamonds
of
ice
in
it
were
stored
all
the
mysteries
which
the
wind
had
ever
overheard
there
were
secrets
confessions
vows
merry
laughs
and
simple
words
and
sure
enough
in
the
corner
of
the
chest
lay
the
rest
of
malvolia
spell
a
row
of
little
dusty
words
the
words
until
he
finds
someone
brave
enough
to
marry
him
so
the
good
poodle
learned
the
words
by
heart
thanked
the
giant
and
hurried
home
with
the
message
when
he
came
to
the
king
palace
he
ran
barking
with
joy
right
into
the
king
own
room
there
he
saw
the
unhappy
parents
have
you
found
the
last
of
the
sentence
cried
the
queen
yes
said
poldo
the
spell
will
end
when
the
prince
marries
that
very
evening
the
king
and
the
queen
sent
forth
ambassadors
to
ask
for
the
hand
of
the
loveliest
princess
of
all
fairyland
princess
adatha
of
the
adamant
mountains
but
so
afraid
was
adatha
of
being
turned
into
something
else
that
she
refused
the
offer
the
king
and
the
queen
then
made
a
request
for
the
hand
of
princess
alicia
of
the
crystal
lakes
but
alicia
also
was
afraid
of
being
turned
into
something
else
and
she
too
refused
the
alliance
so
did
the
princess
of
the
golden
coasts
the
princess
of
the
seven
cities
and
many
others
finally
the
only
princess
left
in
all
fairyland
was
a
princess
who
herself
lay
under
an
enchantment
a
jealous
witch
had
turned
her
golden
hair
bright
blue
and
given
her
a
nose
a
foot
long
this
unhappy
maiden
was
the
only
princess
willing
to
accept
poor
rolandor
the
wedding
day
arrived
the
prince
though
perhaps
a
little
pale
from
his
confined
life
looked
very
handsome
and
led
his
ugly
bride
to
the
altar
like
a
man
just
exactly
as
the
marriage
ceremony
was
half
over
a
spasm
contorted
the
muscles
of
the
prince
face
the
poor
young
man
felt
strongly
inclined
to
sneeze
though
he
could
be
seen
making
heroic
efforts
to
control
the
impulse
the
audience
got
very
nervous
and
panicky
all
was
in
vain
the
prince
sneezed
ker
choo
a
terrific
clap
of
thunder
rent
the
air
and
everybody
looked
about
to
see
what
had
happened
the
effect
of
the
sneeze
was
an
odd
one
as
it
had
occurred
exactly
at
the
moment
when
the
prince
was
the
spell
had
reacted
upon
itself
just
like
a
kick
from
a
gun
dr
pill
said
next
day
the
cats
became
dogs
again
and
the
dogs
became
cats
the
elm
trees
became
cross
elderly
gentlemen
looking
for
their
families
the
poor
excited
roman
senators
fauns
nymphs
satyrs
celebrities
and
historical
personages
went
back
to
their
pictures
and
to
cap
the
climax
the
ugly
bride
became
once
more
her
sweet
and
lovely
self
while
everybody
was
cheering
who
should
walk
out
of
the
sacristy
but
the
court
astrologer
an
instant
later
he
had
fallen
into
the
affectionate
arms
of
the
faithful
wife
who
had
wound
him
up
for
years
after
the
wedding
reception
the
prince
and
his
bride
went
on
a
honeymoon
to
the
enchanted
islands
as
for
poldo
the
poodle
he
was
created
prime
minister
and
lived
to
a
fine
old
age

young
girl
sitting
on
tree
trunk
a
small
bird
is
perched
on
her
left
hand
a
small
bottle
is
fastened
to
her
belt
once
upon
a
time
a
wicked
nobleman
rose
in
rebellion
against
his
rightful
king
and
taking
the
royal
forces
by
surprise
defeated
them
and
seized
the
kingdom
the
dethroned
king
who
had
been
severely
wounded
in
battle
was
cast
in
prison
where
he
soon
died
but
his
widow
the
queen
managed
to
escape
from
the
palace
before
the
usurper
could
lay
hands
upon
her
into
the
dark
forest
which
lay
behind
the
palace
ran
the
queen
holding
her
baby
daughter
in
her
arms
it
was
winter
time
and
a
heavy
snow
had
hidden
the
and
the
roads
presently
the
queen
realized
that
she
was
lost
all
afternoon
however
she
trudged
bravely
on
through
the
silence
and
the
cold
her
heart
sinking
as
mile
after
mile
revealed
no
sign
of
a
house
or
a
shelter
but
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
red
shield
of
the
sun
could
scarcely
be
seen
through
the
tangle
of
the
wild
she
perceived
a
light
coming
from
a
little
grove
of
cedars
by
the
shore
of
a
frozen
lake
the
queen
made
her
way
toward
this
light
and
discovered
a
little
thatched
hut
in
the
silent
wood
it
was
the
house
of
one
of
the
dwarfs
of
the
forest
the
dwarf
took
pity
on
the
queen
but
his
efforts
were
vain
for
the
poor
woman
was
so
weak
and
exhausted
that
she
died
without
telling
the
dwarf
anything
about
herself
or
the
child
she
carried
so
the
little
dwarf
who
was
a
good
kind
old
fellow
brought
the
little
girl
up
as
if
she
were
his
own
child
his
brother
the
dwarf
of
the
mountain
made
her
the
prettiest
shoes
and
his
cousins
the
dwarfs
of
the
pines
made
the
little
girl
dresses
from
cloth
woven
on
fairy
looms
now
on
the
night
her
mother
brought
her
to
the
hut
the
little
girl
was
wearing
a
golden
locket
with
a
crown
and
the
letter
m
upon
it
in
diamonds
so
the
dwarf
called
the
little
girl
marianna
seventeen
years
passed
and
marianna
grew
to
be
quite
the
loveliest
lass
in
all
the
world
her
hair
was
as
black
as
the
raven
wing
her
eyes
were
as
blue
as
the
midsummer
sea
and
her
skin
was
fair
as
the
petal
of
a
rose
one
spring
morning
a
little
yellow
bird
flew
into
the
cedar
grove
and
gave
the
dwarf
a
letter
which
it
held
in
its
beak
the
dwarf
read
the
letter
and
said
to
marianna
little
marianna
the
emperor
of
the
elves
has
bidden
me
come
to
the
great
assembly
of
the
dwarfs
which
is
to
be
held
next
year
on
the
golden
mountain
alas
what
are
we
to
do
i
can
not
take
you
with
me
dear
child
for
it
is
forbidden
on
pain
of
death
to
bring
mortals
to
the
assembly
nor
can
i
leave
you
here
in
this
lonely
wood
to
this
marianna
replied
do
not
fear
dear
father
give
me
but
yon
crystal
flask
of
the
water
of
healing
and
i
shall
go
forth
into
the
world
until
it
is
time
for
you
to
return
again
perhaps
i
shall
discover
somebody
who
can
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
locket
or
the
history
of
my
dear
mother
so
the
dwarf
took
his
knotted
staff
and
went
away
over
hill
over
dale
to
the
golden
mountain
then
marianna
took
the
crystal
flask
of
the
water
of
healing
and
walked
boldly
out
of
the
wood
into
the
wide
wide
world
it
was
the
middle
of
the
spring
the
ice
and
snow
had
all
disappeared
the
trees
were
putting
forth
their
leaves
and
there
were
clusters
of
primroses
by
the
roadside
in
the
swaying
rustling
heart
of
a
great
elm
tree
a
little
thrush
was
singing
through
cities
and
towns
went
lovely
marianna
bringing
good
cheer
to
the
helpless
and
the
sick
and
curing
all
who
came
to
her
rich
and
poor
with
the
wonderful
water
of
healing
but
never
did
she
find
anybody
who
could
tell
her
about
the
gold
heart
with
the
diamond
crown
now
it
came
to
pass
that
as
marianna
was
one
day
walking
through
a
village
in
the
heart
of
the
adamant
mountains
a
ragged
old
woman
besought
her
with
tears
to
come
to
a
hamlet
which
stood
at
the
head
of
a
high
and
dangerous
path
touched
by
the
old
woman
supplication
marianna
followed
her
to
the
hamlet
and
found
in
a
wretched
hut
lying
on
a
wretched
bed
a
beautiful
young
peasant
girl
dying
of
a
fever
so
marianna
touched
the
girl
with
the
water
of
healing
and
in
an
instant
she
became
well
and
strong
dear
lady
said
the
peasant
girl
pressing
marianna
hand
to
her
lips
how
sweet
and
kind
thou
art
great
is
the
debt
i
owe
thee
and
as
the
girl
poured
out
her
thanks
marianna
heard
a
faint
chirp
chirp
and
looking
down
beheld
a
little
yellow
bird
crouching
on
the
hearthstone
every
now
and
then
he
hid
his
head
under
his
wings
and
cried
unhappily
it
was
the
yellow
bird
which
had
brought
the
message
from
the
emperor
of
the
elves
poor
little
bird
said
marianna
bending
down
and
taking
him
up
in
her
hands
why
criest
thou
so
mournfully
who
hath
done
thee
harm
but
the
bird
uttered
only
a
forlorn
little
cry
and
hid
his
head
again
under
his
wings
i
found
him
on
the
rocks
at
the
mountaintop
yesterday
said
the
mother
someone
has
wounded
him
his
wing
is
broken
and
she
put
the
bird
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
bade
marianna
watch
how
he
fluttered
trailing
a
wing
in
the
dust
again
marianna
stooped
and
picking
up
the
bird
touched
the
wounded
wing
with
the
water
of
healing
scarcely
had
she
done
so
when
the
yellow
bird
burst
into
a
joyous
and
golden
song
and
flying
to
the
window
beat
madly
against
the
panes
then
the
peasant
girl
threw
open
the
casement
and
the
yellow
bird
flew
out
into
the
streaming
sun
he
is
gone
forever
said
the
peasant
girl
nay
he
returns
said
marianna
gently
as
the
yellow
bird
flew
back
and
perched
in
the
sheltering
bower
of
marianna
arms
then
accompanied
by
the
peasant
girl
and
the
yellow
bird
who
flew
singing
before
her
marianna
went
down
the
dangerous
path
to
the
high
road
in
the
valley
when
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
path
the
peasant
girl
cried
farewell
dear
marianna
may
it
some
day
be
mine
to
repay
thee
into
the
world
again
went
marianna
and
with
her
went
the
yellow
bird
presently
she
came
to
the
fairest
land
which
she
had
ever
seen
a
land
of
rolling
fields
little
hills
and
rivers
bordered
with
pale
willow
trees
this
pleasant
land
unknown
to
marianna
was
part
of
her
kingdom
and
she
was
really
its
queen
because
her
father
had
been
the
last
rightful
king
now
while
marianna
had
been
in
the
forest
the
wicked
nobleman
who
had
stolen
the
kingdom
from
marianna
father
had
died
leaving
his
brother
garabin
in
charge
of
the
kingdom
and
of
the
interests
of
his
little
son
prince
desire
this
garabin
however
taking
advantage
of
the
youth
and
helplessness
of
his
nephew
had
himself
assumed
the
state
and
airs
of
king
for
some
time
he
had
enjoyed
undisturbed
the
possession
of
his
stolen
throne
but
as
desire
grew
taller
and
stronger
every
year
garabin
began
to
fear
the
day
when
he
would
be
compelled
to
resign
in
favor
of
his
nephew
when
the
prince
reached
his
twentieth
year
garabin
would
certainly
have
killed
him
openly
had
he
dared
but
fearing
the
people
he
resolved
to
use
secret
methods
and
bribed
a
cruel
magician
to
afflict
poor
desire
with
a
deadly
and
mysterious
malady
of
this
malady
desire
was
slowly
dying
for
no
medicine
could
cure
him
or
even
give
him
any
relief
from
his
constant
pain
every
morning
the
cruel
garabin
in
the
hope
of
finding
his
nephew
dead
would
go
to
the
sick
room
and
you
may
be
sure
that
his
wicked
heart
rejoiced
when
he
found
the
prince
weaker
and
more
feverish
garabin
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
the
prince
who
was
rapidly
failing
when
the
captain
of
the
castle
guard
came
to
him
with
the
news
that
the
wonderful
marianna
had
arrived
in
the
kingdom
the
king
gave
orders
that
she
be
brought
before
him
so
marianna
walking
between
two
halberdiers
and
followed
across
the
courtyard
by
crowds
of
curious
people
was
led
before
the
king
the
little
yellow
bird
sat
on
marianna
shoulder
and
never
did
maiden
appear
lovelier
or
more
gentle
scarcely
had
garabin
set
eyes
on
marianna
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
golden
locket
which
she
wore
about
her
neck
had
he
not
been
very
old
and
crafty
he
would
have
started
from
his
golden
throne
for
he
knew
that
the
little
golden
heart
set
with
diamonds
had
been
one
of
the
crown
jewels
and
that
therefore
marianna
must
be
the
missing
princess
and
rightful
queen
of
the
kingdom
what
was
he
to
do
if
he
refused
to
let
marianna
help
the
prince
the
people
might
begin
to
suspect
him
and
start
a
revolution
which
would
thrust
him
from
his
throne
if
he
allowed
marianna
to
cure
the
prince
the
prince
would
certainly
demand
the
kingdom
on
his
birthday
what
was
he
to
do
with
marianna
whose
right
to
the
throne
was
superior
even
to
his
nephew
perplexed
and
with
fear
in
his
heart
the
king
sought
the
cruel
magician
who
had
cast
the
spell
on
desire
the
magician
lived
in
a
gloomy
tower
and
had
an
enchanted
black
dog
that
he
fed
with
flaming
coals
he
listened
to
garabin
story
stirring
a
great
cauldron
all
the
while
and
said
do
not
fear
i
will
destroy
both
claimants
to
the
throne
at
once
garabin
rubbed
his
hands
together
with
glee
i
shall
cast
a
spell
of
sleep
on
marianna
steal
the
crystal
flask
empty
it
of
the
water
of
healing
and
refill
it
with
a
liquid
which
will
cause
death
within
a
night
and
a
day
i
shall
then
replace
the
flask
before
marianna
wakes
you
will
allow
marianna
to
visit
the
prince
she
will
touch
him
with
the
deadly
water
and
the
prince
will
die
you
can
then
try
marianna
for
having
killed
the
prince
and
condemn
her
to
be
thrown
from
the
precipice
so
pleased
was
garabin
with
this
horrid
plot
that
he
could
have
danced
for
joy
that
very
night
the
magician
filled
marianna
flask
with
the
poisonous
water
and
departed
thinking
that
nobody
had
noticed
him
the
yellow
bird
however
had
seen
everything
and
followed
the
magician
to
note
where
he
hid
the
real
water
of
healing
the
next
morning
marianna
was
once
more
led
before
the
king
welcome
thrice
welcome
lovely
maiden
said
garabin
with
the
most
dreadful
hypocrisy
i
have
long
hoped
that
you
would
turn
your
footsteps
hither
for
my
poor
dear
nephew
prince
desire
only
son
of
the
late
king
has
been
ill
for
some
months
of
a
malady
no
physician
can
cure
perhaps
you
can
cure
him
with
the
water
of
healing
marianna
replied
that
she
would
do
her
best
to
help
the
prince
so
the
court
chamberlain
gave
her
his
arm
and
escorted
her
to
the
sick
room
the
king
and
many
courtiers
followed
after
him
desire
lay
in
a
great
bed
his
face
flushed
with
fever
so
weak
was
the
poor
prince
that
he
could
scarcely
lift
his
head
to
look
at
his
visitors
a
great
pity
swept
over
marianna
heart
the
instant
she
saw
him
as
for
desire
he
fell
madly
in
love
with
marianna
at
first
sight
now
just
as
marianna
bent
over
the
prince
to
touch
his
forehead
with
the
water
of
healing
the
yellow
bird
screamed
and
cried
as
madly
as
if
he
were
caught
in
a
net
marianna
looked
at
the
crystal
flask
nothing
seemed
changed
the
water
within
seemed
as
pure
and
as
ever
she
touched
the
prince
with
the
liquid
alas
in
a
moment
so
terrible
was
the
magician
poison
that
the
prince
turned
white
as
the
driven
snow
and
fell
back
on
the
pillows
insensible
the
who
had
expected
to
see
him
spring
up
entirely
cured
began
to
murmur
and
marianna
herself
terrified
at
what
had
happened
let
fall
the
flask
which
broke
into
a
thousand
sparkling
pieces
suddenly
garabin
cried
at
the
top
of
his
voice
seize
the
witch
she
has
killed
the
prince
presently
there
was
a
great
confusion
rough
hands
seized
marianna
and
somebody
caught
the
yellow
bird
the
prince
remained
insensible
on
the
bed
at
high
noon
a
trial
was
held
and
since
the
doctors
declared
that
the
prince
was
dying
marianna
was
condemned
to
be
thrown
from
the
precipice
when
somebody
asked
about
the
yellow
bird
garabin
laughed
and
gave
orders
that
the
cook
should
wring
its
neck
and
toss
it
to
the
cat
so
marianna
was
hurried
to
a
dark
and
loaded
with
chains
and
the
yellow
bird
was
taken
to
the
castle
kitchen
and
given
to
the
cook
here
you
wring
its
neck
said
the
cook
to
one
of
her
helpers
while
i
go
call
the
cat
by
great
good
fortune
the
cook
helper
was
no
other
than
the
peasant
girl
whom
marianna
had
saved
this
girl
recognized
the
yellow
bird
and
instead
of
wringing
its
neck
let
it
fly
out
of
the
window
the
yellow
bird
flew
to
the
window
of
the
magician
room
the
magician
was
in
the
chamber
stirring
the
giant
cauldron
the
bird
flew
to
the
window
of
prince
desire
room
and
saw
that
he
was
still
insensible
an
hour
later
the
began
to
toll
and
a
dismal
procession
was
seen
walking
from
the
castle
toward
the
frightful
cliff
from
which
condemned
witches
and
sorcerers
were
thrown
first
came
a
troop
of
soldiers
then
marianna
weighted
down
with
chains
and
last
of
all
a
little
group
in
which
were
garabin
the
magician
and
some
of
favorites
the
bell
kept
on
sadly
tolling
and
tolling
it
roused
the
prince
from
his
swoon
and
with
his
last
measure
of
strength
poor
desire
dragged
himself
to
the
window
the
procession
was
then
passing
directly
underneath
the
window
and
desire
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
marianna
stop
stop
cried
the
poor
prince
wildly
i
forbid
an
instant
later
he
sank
fainting
to
the
floor
the
procession
went
on
meanwhile
the
yellow
bird
had
returned
to
the
magician
chamber
it
was
empty
with
a
joyous
cry
the
bird
fluttered
through
the
and
discovered
the
phial
into
which
the
magician
had
poured
the
water
of
healing
clutching
it
in
his
claws
the
bird
flew
once
more
to
the
prince
room
desire
still
lay
in
a
heap
by
the
window
and
over
him
the
yellow
bird
poured
the
contents
of
the
phial
the
prince
sprang
up
strong
as
a
lion
seized
his
sword
and
rushed
down
to
save
marianna
he
arrived
at
the
cliff
just
as
the
poor
maiden
was
about
to
be
pushed
off
into
space
and
standing
by
her
side
dared
anyone
to
lay
hands
upon
her
garabin
seeing
his
precious
plot
miscarry
grew
mad
with
rage
seize
them
cried
he
and
toss
them
both
over
the
precipice
so
the
soldiers
rushed
at
marianna
and
the
prince
intending
to
carry
out
their
wicked
master
orders
but
even
as
they
did
so
there
came
a
flash
of
flame
and
the
little
dwarf
marianna
took
his
place
beside
the
lovers
cruel
king
cried
the
dwarf
sternly
and
thou
wicked
and
perfidious
magician
the
hour
of
thy
punishment
is
at
hand
immediately
the
sky
grew
black
the
lightning
crashed
and
there
arose
a
terrible
howling
wind
three
giant
gusts
drove
fiercely
by
the
first
one
blowing
the
king
and
the
magician
over
the
precipice
the
second
carrying
away
the
soldiers
and
the
third
the
rascally
favorites
when
the
sky
cleared
only
the
dwarf
marianna
and
desire
were
left
of
the
company
marianna
said
the
little
dwarf
the
emperor
of
the
elves
has
told
me
all
your
history
and
it
is
thanks
to
him
that
i
have
returned
in
time
with
the
storm
at
my
heels
you
marianna
are
the
rightful
queen
of
this
country
dear
queen
said
the
honest
and
gallant
desire
let
me
be
the
first
of
your
subjects
to
salute
you
and
he
knelt
before
her
and
humbly
kissed
her
hand
nay
prince
said
the
young
queen
answering
the
adoring
look
in
her
lover
eyes
your
father
took
the
kingdom
if
i
were
you
i
should
take
the
queen
which
was
a
bit
forward
of
course
but
nobody
minded
that
very
much
in
those
fairy
times
so
desire
and
marianna
were
married
and
lived
happily
ever
after
the
yellow
bird
went
to
the
wedding
and
when
the
ceremony
was
over
rose
singing
into
the
air
and
flew
joyously
home
to
the
land
of
the
elves
the
lost
once
upon
a
time
there
was
an
old
widow
woman
who
had
three
sons
the
first
two
were
clever
enough
but
the
third
bobo
by
name
was
little
better
than
a
silly
simpleton
all
his
mother
scoldings
and
beatings
and
she
smacked
the
poor
lad
soundly
a
dozen
times
a
day
did
him
no
good
whatever
now
it
came
to
pass
that
one
morning
princess
zenza
the
ruler
of
the
land
happened
to
pass
by
the
cottage
and
heard
bobo
being
given
a
terrible
curious
as
to
the
cause
of
all
the
noise
the
princess
drew
rein
and
summoned
bobo
mother
to
come
near
on
hearing
her
story
it
occurred
to
the
princess
that
so
silly
a
lad
might
amuse
her
so
she
gave
the
mother
a
golden
florin
and
took
poor
silly
bobo
with
her
to
be
her
page
illustration
in
the
background
a
castle
in
the
middle
ground
a
boy
throwing
a
spiny
object
into
a
dragon
mouth
in
the
foreground
a
frightened
girl
just
as
the
dragon
mouth
was
at
its
widest
you
may
be
sure
that
it
did
not
take
the
wise
folk
at
the
castle
long
to
discover
how
great
a
simpleton
had
arrived
courtiers
footmen
lackeys
turnspits
even
were
forever
sending
him
off
on
ridiculous
errands
now
he
would
be
sent
to
find
a
white
craw
feather
or
a
spray
of
yellow
bluebells
now
he
was
ordered
to
look
for
a
square
wheel
or
a
glass
of
dry
water
everybody
laughed
at
him
and
made
fun
of
him
that
is
everybody
except
little
tilda
the
when
poor
bobo
used
to
return
from
some
chase
tired
out
and
often
enough
wet
to
the
skin
instead
of
laughing
little
tilda
would
find
him
a
glass
of
warm
milk
hang
his
coat
by
the
fire
to
dry
and
tell
him
not
to
be
such
a
simpleton
again
thus
after
a
while
bobo
learned
to
ask
tilda
advice
before
going
away
on
a
chase
and
was
in
this
way
saved
from
many
a
jest
tilda
the
was
as
sweet
and
pretty
as
she
was
kind
and
good
she
was
said
to
be
the
daughter
of
an
old
crane
who
had
come
to
the
castle
one
day
asking
for
help
one
pleasant
morning
when
bobo
had
been
nearly
a
year
at
the
castle
princess
zenza
overslept
half
an
hour
and
did
not
come
down
to
breakfast
at
the
usual
time
when
she
did
get
up
she
found
her
court
waiting
for
her
in
the
castle
gardens
as
she
came
down
the
steps
of
the
garden
terrace
the
princess
looked
up
at
the
castle
clock
to
see
how
late
she
was
and
said
to
her
lady
in
waiting
dear
me
why
i
lost
half
an
hour
this
morning
at
these
words
bobo
who
was
in
attendance
pricked
up
his
ears
and
said
please
your
highness
perhaps
i
can
find
it
at
this
idea
of
finding
a
lost
the
princess
laughed
and
found
herself
echoed
by
the
company
shall
we
send
bobo
in
search
of
the
lost
said
the
princess
to
the
courtiers
yes
yes
cried
the
courtiers
bobo
shall
look
for
the
lost
i
give
him
a
horse
said
one
i
give
him
my
old
hat
said
another
he
can
have
an
old
sword
i
broke
last
week
said
still
another
and
so
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
about
it
poor
simpleton
bobo
was
made
ready
for
his
journey
before
he
left
the
castle
bobo
went
down
to
the
kitchen
to
say
to
tilda
what
off
again
said
the
little
where
are
you
going
now
the
princess
has
lost
a
and
i
am
going
in
search
of
it
said
bobo
proudly
and
he
told
how
the
princess
herself
had
commanded
him
to
seek
the
through
the
world
and
promised
to
bring
tilda
a
splendid
present
when
he
returned
the
good
said
little
for
she
feared
lest
some
misadventure
overtake
the
poor
simpleton
but
when
the
chief
cook
was
not
looking
she
tucked
a
fresh
into
bobo
pocket
and
wished
him
the
best
of
good
fortune
so
bobo
went
to
the
castle
gate
and
mounted
his
horse
which
stumbled
and
was
blind
in
one
eye
bobo
cried
the
assembled
courtiers
who
were
almost
beside
themselves
with
laughter
at
the
simpleton
and
his
errand
do
fail
to
bring
back
the
lost
so
bobo
rode
over
the
hills
and
far
away
every
now
and
then
he
would
stop
a
and
ask
him
if
he
had
seen
a
lost
the
first
person
whom
he
thus
questioned
was
an
old
man
who
was
wandering
down
the
high
road
that
leads
from
the
kingdom
of
the
east
to
the
kingdom
of
the
west
a
lost
said
the
old
man
i
lost
something
much
more
serious
i
lost
my
reputation
you
have
seen
a
lost
reputation
lying
about
here
have
you
it
was
very
dignified
and
wore
glasses
but
bobo
had
to
answer
no
and
the
old
man
wandered
on
again
another
day
the
simpleton
encountered
a
tall
dark
fierce
kind
of
fellow
who
answered
his
polite
question
with
a
scream
of
rage
a
he
roared
no
i
have
seen
your
i
would
tell
you
if
i
had
what
more
i
do
want
to
see
it
i
looking
for
something
i
lost
myself
i
lost
my
temper
i
lost
it
two
years
ago
at
home
and
have
been
able
to
find
it
anywhere
since
answer
me
you
silly
have
you
seen
a
lost
temper
anywhere
it
about
the
size
of
a
large
melon
and
has
sharp
little
points
on
bobo
answering
no
this
dreadful
person
uttered
so
perfectly
awful
a
screech
of
rage
that
bobo
horse
took
fright
and
ran
away
with
him
and
it
was
all
that
bobo
could
do
to
rein
him
in
three
miles
farther
down
the
road
still
farther
along
bobo
came
to
zizz
the
capital
city
of
the
kingdom
of
the
seven
brooks
and
was
taken
before
the
king
himself
a
lost
said
the
king
no
i
am
quite
sure
it
has
not
been
seen
in
my
dominions
would
you
mind
asking
as
you
go
through
the
world
for
news
of
my
little
daughter
here
the
poor
old
king
took
out
a
great
green
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
eyes
she
was
stolen
by
the
fairies
on
midsummer
eve
fifteen
years
ago
find
her
worthy
bobo
and
an
immense
reward
will
be
yours
so
bobo
left
the
proud
city
of
zizz
and
once
again
rode
over
the
hills
and
far
away
but
never
a
sign
of
the
lost
did
he
find
although
he
asked
thousands
of
people
his
faithful
white
horse
died
and
he
continued
his
way
on
foot
three
long
years
passed
and
bobo
grew
into
a
handsome
lad
but
remained
a
simpleton
still
finally
after
he
had
wandered
all
about
fairyland
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
finding
a
ship
moored
in
a
little
harbor
bobo
asked
the
sailors
if
they
had
seen
a
lost
no
said
the
sailors
but
we
are
going
to
the
isles
of
iron
suppose
you
go
with
us
the
lost
may
be
there
so
bobo
went
aboard
the
ship
and
sailed
out
upon
the
dark
sea
for
two
days
the
weather
was
warm
and
clear
but
on
the
third
day
there
came
a
dreadful
storm
and
on
the
third
night
the
vessel
was
driven
far
off
her
course
into
the
unknown
ocean
and
was
wrecked
upon
a
mysterious
island
of
rocks
that
shone
in
the
night
like
wet
matches
a
great
wave
swept
the
decks
and
bobo
was
borne
away
from
his
companions
and
carried
toward
the
shining
land
though
pounded
and
battered
by
the
foaming
waves
the
simpleton
at
length
managed
to
reach
the
beach
and
took
refuge
in
a
crevice
of
the
cliff
during
the
stormy
night
when
the
dawn
broke
all
sign
of
the
ship
had
disappeared
looking
about
bobo
found
himself
on
a
lovely
island
whose
heart
was
a
high
mountain
mass
hidden
in
the
fog
still
sweeping
in
from
the
sea
there
was
not
a
house
a
road
or
a
path
to
be
seen
suddenly
bobo
noticed
a
strange
little
door
in
the
bark
of
a
great
lonely
tree
and
opening
this
door
he
discovered
a
little
cupboard
in
which
were
a
pair
of
wooden
shoes
above
the
shoes
was
a
card
saying
simply
put
us
on
so
bobo
sat
down
on
a
stone
by
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
put
on
the
wooden
shoes
which
fitted
him
very
nicely
now
these
shoes
were
magic
shoes
and
bobo
had
hardly
stepped
into
them
before
they
turned
his
feet
inland
so
bobo
obediently
let
the
shoes
guide
him
at
corners
the
shoes
always
turned
in
the
right
direction
and
if
bobo
forgot
and
blundered
on
the
wrong
way
the
shoes
swiftly
began
to
pinch
his
toes
for
two
days
bobo
walked
inland
toward
the
great
mountain
a
warm
wind
blew
the
clouds
and
rain
away
the
sun
shone
sweet
and
clear
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
the
simpleton
entered
a
wood
of
tall
silent
trees
and
as
that
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
turrets
of
a
magnificent
castle
rose
far
away
over
the
leaves
of
the
forest
bobo
arrived
at
twilight
he
found
himself
in
a
beautiful
garden
lying
between
the
castle
walls
and
the
rising
slopes
of
a
great
mountain
strange
to
say
not
a
living
creature
was
to
be
seen
and
though
there
were
lights
in
the
castle
there
was
not
even
a
warder
at
the
gate
suddenly
a
great
booming
bell
struck
seven
bobo
began
to
hear
voices
and
sounds
and
then
before
the
humming
of
the
bell
had
died
away
a
youth
mounted
on
a
splendid
black
horse
dashed
at
lightning
speed
out
of
the
castle
and
disappeared
in
the
wood
an
old
man
with
a
white
beard
accompanied
by
eleven
young
men
whom
bobo
judged
from
their
expressions
to
be
brothers
stood
by
the
gate
to
see
the
horseman
ride
away
plucking
up
courage
bobo
came
forward
fell
on
his
knee
before
the
old
man
and
told
his
story
truly
you
should
thank
the
storm
fairies
said
the
old
man
for
had
you
not
been
wrecked
upon
this
island
never
would
you
have
discovered
the
lost
i
am
father
time
himself
and
these
are
my
twelve
sons
the
hours
every
day
one
after
the
other
they
ride
for
an
hour
round
the
whole
wide
world
seven
has
just
ridden
forth
yes
you
shall
have
the
lost
but
you
must
look
after
my
horses
for
the
space
of
a
whole
year
to
this
bobo
willingly
agreed
so
twelve
who
was
the
youngest
of
the
hours
took
him
to
the
stables
and
showed
him
the
little
room
in
the
turret
that
he
was
to
have
and
thus
for
a
year
bobo
served
father
time
and
his
sons
he
took
such
good
care
of
the
great
black
horses
of
the
hours
of
the
night
and
the
white
horses
of
the
hours
of
the
day
that
they
were
never
more
proud
and
strong
nor
their
coats
smoother
and
more
gleaming
when
the
year
was
up
bobo
again
sought
out
father
time
you
have
served
faithfully
and
well
said
father
time
here
is
your
reward
and
with
these
words
he
placed
in
bobo
hands
a
small
square
casket
made
of
ebony
the
lies
inside
do
try
to
peek
at
it
or
open
the
box
until
the
right
time
has
come
if
you
do
the
will
flyaway
and
disappear
forever
farewell
bobo
said
kind
young
twelve
who
had
been
the
simpleton
good
friend
i
too
have
a
gift
for
thee
drink
this
cup
of
water
to
the
last
drop
and
the
youth
handed
the
simpleton
a
silver
cup
full
to
the
brim
of
clear
shining
water
now
this
water
was
the
water
of
wisdom
and
when
bobo
had
drunk
it
he
was
no
longer
a
simpleton
and
being
no
longer
a
simpleton
he
remembered
the
man
who
had
lost
his
reputation
the
man
who
had
lost
his
temper
and
the
king
whose
daughter
had
been
stolen
by
the
fairies
so
bobo
made
so
bold
as
to
ask
father
time
about
them
for
father
time
knows
everything
that
has
happened
in
the
whole
wide
world
tell
the
first
said
father
time
that
his
reputation
has
been
broken
into
a
thousand
pieces
which
have
been
picked
up
by
his
neighbors
and
carried
home
if
he
can
persuade
his
neighbors
to
give
them
up
he
should
be
able
to
piece
together
a
pretty
good
reputation
again
as
for
the
man
who
lost
his
temper
tell
him
that
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
grass
by
the
roadside
close
by
the
spot
where
you
first
met
him
as
for
the
missing
daughter
she
is
the
in
princess
palace
who
is
known
as
tilda
so
bobo
thanked
father
time
and
at
noon
twelve
placed
him
behind
him
on
the
white
charger
and
hurried
away
so
fast
they
flew
that
bobo
who
was
holding
the
ebony
casket
close
against
his
heart
was
in
great
danger
of
falling
off
when
they
got
to
the
seashore
the
white
horse
hesitated
not
an
instant
but
set
foot
upon
the
water
which
bore
him
up
as
if
it
had
been
not
water
but
earth
itself
once
arrived
at
the
shore
of
fairyland
twelve
stopped
wished
bobo
and
rising
in
the
air
disappeared
into
the
glare
of
the
sun
bobo
with
the
precious
ebony
casket
in
his
hand
continued
on
in
the
direction
of
princess
zenza
palace
on
the
second
morning
of
his
journey
he
happened
to
see
far
ahead
of
him
on
the
highway
the
unfortunate
aged
man
who
had
lost
his
reputation
to
him
therefore
bobo
repeated
the
counsel
of
father
time
and
sent
him
hurrying
home
to
his
neighbors
houses
of
the
man
who
had
lost
his
temper
bobo
found
no
sign
in
the
grass
by
the
roadside
however
he
did
find
the
lost
temper
a
queer
sort
of
affair
like
a
melon
of
fiery
red
glass
all
stuck
over
with
uneven
spines
and
brittle
thorns
bobo
with
great
goodness
of
heart
took
along
this
extraordinary
object
in
the
hope
of
finding
its
angry
possessor
farther
on
the
lad
encountered
tilda
father
the
unhappy
king
and
delivered
his
message
the
joy
of
the
monarch
knew
no
bounds
and
bobo
the
simpleton
became
on
the
spot
lord
bobo
of
the
sapphire
hills
marquis
of
the
mountains
of
the
moon
prince
of
the
valley
of
golden
apples
and
lord
seneschal
of
the
proud
city
of
zizz
in
a
word
the
greatest
nobleman
in
all
fairyland
then
having
got
together
a
magnificent
cohort
of
dukes
earls
and
counts
all
in
splendid
silks
and
soldiers
in
shining
armor
the
delighted
king
rode
off
to
claim
his
missing
daughter
from
princess
zenza
so
on
they
rode
the
harnesses
jingling
the
ringing
and
the
breastplates
of
the
armed
men
shining
in
the
sun
after
a
week
of
almost
constant
progress
for
the
king
was
so
anxious
to
see
his
beloved
daughter
that
he
would
hardly
give
the
cavalcade
time
to
rest
they
came
to
the
frontiers
of
princess
zenza
kingdom
strange
to
say
black
mourning
banners
hung
from
the
trees
and
every
door
in
the
first
village
which
the
travelers
saw
was
likewise
hung
with
black
streamers
on
the
steps
of
one
of
the
cottages
sat
an
old
woman
all
alone
and
weeping
with
all
her
might
what
is
the
matter
my
good
woman
said
the
king
o
sir
said
the
peasant
woman
evil
days
have
fallen
upon
our
unhappy
kingdom
three
days
ago
a
terrible
dragon
alighted
in
the
gardens
of
the
palace
and
sent
word
to
princess
zenza
that
if
within
three
days
she
did
not
provide
him
with
someone
brave
enough
to
go
home
with
him
and
cook
his
meals
and
keep
his
cavern
tidy
he
would
burn
our
fields
with
his
fiery
breath
yet
who
i
ask
you
would
be
housekeeper
for
a
dragon
suppose
he
did
like
the
puddings
you
made
for
him
why
he
might
eat
you
up
all
would
have
been
lost
had
not
a
brave
little
named
tilda
volunteered
to
go
it
is
for
her
that
we
are
mourning
at
two
she
is
to
be
carried
off
by
the
dragon
it
is
almost
two
now
alas
alas
hardly
were
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
when
the
town
bell
struck
twice
solemnly
and
sadly
quick
quick
cried
the
king
and
bobo
in
the
same
breath
let
us
hurry
to
the
castle
we
may
save
her
yet
but
they
knew
in
their
hearts
that
they
were
too
late
and
that
poor
tilda
had
given
herself
to
the
dragon
and
so
it
proved
in
spite
of
his
mad
dash
bobo
who
had
spurred
on
ahead
arrived
exactly
half
an
hour
late
the
monstrous
dragon
with
tilda
in
his
claws
was
just
a
little
smoky
speck
far
down
the
southern
sky
princess
zenza
and
her
court
stood
by
wringing
their
jeweled
hands
suddenly
bobo
thought
of
the
he
had
arrived
half
an
hour
late
but
he
could
have
that
back
again
things
should
be
exactly
as
they
were
half
an
hour
before
he
opened
the
cover
of
the
ebony
box
something
like
a
winged
white
flame
escaped
from
it
and
flew
hissing
through
the
air
to
the
sun
as
for
the
sun
itself
turning
round
like
a
cartwheel
and
hissing
like
ten
thousand
rockets
it
rolled
back
along
the
sky
to
the
east
the
hands
of
the
clocks
which
marked
two
whirred
back
to
two
in
a
twinkling
and
sure
enough
there
was
brave
little
tilda
standing
alone
in
a
great
field
waiting
for
the
dragon
to
come
and
take
her
away
lumbering
heavily
along
like
a
monstrous
turtle
and
snorting
blue
smoke
the
dragon
was
advancing
toward
her
bobo
ran
down
into
the
field
and
stood
beside
tilda
ready
to
defend
her
to
the
end
the
dragon
came
nearer
and
nearer
suddenly
angered
by
the
sight
of
bobo
and
his
drawn
sword
he
roared
angrily
but
continued
to
approach
bobo
struck
at
him
with
his
sword
the
blade
broke
upon
his
steely
scales
the
dragon
roared
again
now
just
as
the
dragon
mouth
was
its
widest
bobo
who
had
been
searching
his
pockets
desperately
hurled
into
it
the
lost
temper
there
was
a
perfectly
terrific
bang
as
if
a
million
balloons
had
blown
up
all
at
once
for
the
dragon
had
blown
up
the
lost
temper
had
finished
him
only
one
fragment
of
him
a
tiny
bit
of
a
claw
was
ever
found
everybody
you
may
be
sure
began
to
cry
hurrah
and
hooray
and
soon
they
were
firing
off
cannon
and
ringing
all
the
bells
then
father
took
her
in
his
arms
and
told
her
that
she
was
a
real
princess
the
grand
cross
of
the
order
of
the
black
cat
was
conferred
upon
bobo
by
princess
zenza
who
also
asked
his
pardon
for
having
treated
him
so
shabbily
this
bobo
gave
readily
a
wonderful
fete
was
held
when
the
rejoicings
were
over
bobo
and
tilda
were
married
and
lived
happily
together
all
their
days
the
enchanted
elm
illustration
young
girl
sitting
in
a
tree
once
upon
a
time
while
riding
a
brave
young
prince
dashed
merrily
ahead
of
his
friends
and
after
galloping
across
a
ploughed
field
turned
his
horse
head
down
a
grassy
road
leading
to
a
wood
for
some
time
he
cantered
easily
along
expecting
any
moment
to
hear
the
shouts
and
halloos
of
his
friends
following
after
but
they
by
mistake
took
quite
another
road
and
no
sound
except
the
pounding
of
his
hoofs
reached
the
prince
ear
suddenly
an
ugly
snarl
and
a
short
bark
broke
the
stillness
of
the
pleasant
forest
and
looking
down
the
prince
saw
a
gray
wolf
snapping
at
his
horse
heels
though
the
horse
wild
with
fear
threatened
to
run
away
any
instant
the
prince
leaned
over
and
struck
the
wolf
with
his
whip
hardly
had
he
done
so
when
an
angry
voice
cried
how
dare
you
strike
my
pet
a
little
distance
ahead
a
wicked
old
witch
stood
at
one
side
of
the
road
with
its
tail
between
its
legs
the
wolf
cowered
close
to
her
skirts
and
showed
its
long
yellow
fangs
pet
indeed
cried
the
prince
keep
him
away
from
my
horse
or
i
will
strike
him
again
at
your
peril
prince
answered
the
witch
and
then
as
the
prince
turned
his
horse
head
and
galloped
back
she
called
out
you
shall
rue
this
day
you
shall
rue
this
day
now
by
the
time
the
prince
had
arrived
at
the
ploughed
field
and
the
great
road
again
his
friends
had
galloped
on
so
far
that
they
were
lost
to
sight
thinking
that
he
might
overtake
them
by
following
a
shorter
road
he
turned
down
a
byway
skirting
the
wood
in
which
he
had
encountered
the
enchantress
presently
he
began
to
feel
very
thirsty
chancing
to
see
an
old
peasant
woman
in
the
fields
the
prince
called
to
her
and
asked
where
he
could
find
a
roadside
spring
now
this
old
peasant
woman
was
the
wicked
witch
under
another
form
overjoyed
at
having
the
prince
fall
so
easily
into
her
power
she
curtsied
and
replied
that
within
the
wood
was
to
be
found
the
finest
spring
in
the
country
anxious
not
to
lose
time
the
prince
begged
her
to
lead
him
to
the
water
little
did
he
know
that
the
witch
was
leading
him
back
into
the
wood
and
that
she
had
just
bewitched
the
water
when
they
arrived
at
the
pool
the
prince
dismounted
and
kneeling
by
the
brim
made
a
cup
of
his
hands
and
drank
till
his
thirst
was
satisfied
he
was
just
about
to
seize
his
horse
again
by
the
bridle
and
put
his
foot
into
the
stirrup
when
a
terrible
pang
shot
through
his
body
darkness
swam
before
his
eyes
his
arms
lengthened
and
became
branches
his
fingers
twigs
his
feet
shot
into
the
ground
and
he
found
himself
turned
into
a
giant
elm
a
giant
elm
he
was
a
giant
elm
he
remained
unable
to
find
him
after
a
long
search
his
friends
gave
him
up
for
lost
and
a
new
prince
ruled
over
the
land
though
the
elm
tried
many
times
to
tell
of
his
plight
none
ever
seemed
to
understand
his
words
again
and
again
when
simple
ventured
into
the
great
dark
wood
he
would
tell
them
his
story
and
cry
out
i
am
the
prince
i
am
the
prince
but
the
heard
only
the
wind
stirring
in
the
branches
ah
how
cold
it
was
in
winter
when
the
skies
were
steely
black
and
the
giant
stars
sparkled
icily
and
how
pleasant
it
was
when
spring
returned
and
the
gossipy
birds
came
back
again
the
first
year
a
pair
of
took
to
housekeeping
in
his
topmost
branches
the
prince
was
glad
to
welcome
them
for
though
denied
human
speech
he
understood
the
language
of
trees
and
birds
on
midsummer
eve
the
pigeons
said
to
him
the
king
of
the
trees
comes
through
the
wood
do
you
not
hear
the
stir
in
the
forest
all
the
real
trees
are
preparing
for
the
king
coming
they
are
shedding
dead
leaves
and
shaking
out
their
branches
tell
me
of
the
king
said
the
prince
he
is
tall
and
dark
and
strong
said
the
doves
he
dwells
in
a
great
pine
in
the
north
on
midsummer
eve
he
goes
through
the
world
to
see
if
all
is
well
with
the
tree
people
do
you
think
he
can
help
me
asked
the
prince
you
might
ask
him
replied
the
doves
the
long
long
twilight
of
midsummer
eve
came
to
a
close
night
folded
the
world
beneath
its
starry
curtains
at
twelve
though
not
a
breath
of
air
was
stirring
the
trees
were
shaken
as
if
by
a
mighty
wind
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
blending
into
strange
and
lovely
music
and
presently
the
king
of
the
trees
entered
the
haunted
wood
even
as
the
had
said
he
was
tall
and
dark
and
stately
is
all
well
with
you
o
my
people
said
the
king
in
a
voice
as
sweet
and
solemn
as
the
wind
in
the
branches
on
a
summer
day
yes
all
is
well
answered
the
trees
softly
though
some
replied
i
have
lost
a
branch
and
a
little
tree
called
out
unhappily
my
neighbors
are
shutting
out
all
my
sunlight
then
fare
ye
well
my
people
till
next
midsummer
eve
said
the
stately
king
and
he
was
about
to
stride
onward
through
the
dark
wood
when
the
enchanted
prince
called
aloud
to
him
stay
o
king
of
the
trees
cried
the
poor
prince
hear
me
even
though
i
am
not
of
your
people
i
am
a
mortal
a
prince
and
a
wicked
witch
has
turned
me
into
a
tree
can
you
not
help
me
alas
poor
friend
i
can
do
nothing
replied
the
king
however
do
not
despair
in
my
travels
through
the
world
i
shall
surely
find
someone
who
can
help
you
look
for
me
on
next
midsummer
eve
so
the
great
elm
swayed
his
branches
sadly
and
the
king
went
on
his
way
the
winter
came
again
silent
and
dark
and
cold
at
the
return
of
spring
a
maiden
who
dwelt
with
a
family
of
came
often
to
rest
in
the
shade
of
the
great
tree
her
father
had
once
been
a
rich
merchant
but
evil
times
had
overtaken
him
and
at
his
death
the
only
relatives
who
could
be
found
to
take
care
of
the
little
girl
were
a
family
of
rough
in
the
royal
service
these
grudging
folk
kept
the
poor
maiden
always
hard
at
work
and
gave
her
the
most
difficult
household
tasks
the
prince
who
knew
the
whole
story
pitied
her
very
much
and
ended
by
falling
quite
in
love
with
her
as
for
the
unhappy
maiden
it
seemed
to
her
that
beneath
the
sheltering
shade
of
the
great
elm
she
enjoyed
a
peace
and
happiness
to
be
found
nowhere
else
now
it
was
the
custom
of
the
to
cut
down
during
the
summer
such
trees
as
would
be
needed
for
the
coming
winter
and
one
day
the
in
whose
family
the
maiden
dwelt
announced
his
intention
of
cutting
down
the
great
elm
not
the
great
elm
which
towers
above
all
the
forest
cried
the
maiden
yes
that
very
tree
answered
the
woodcutter
gruffly
morning
we
shall
fell
it
to
the
ground
and
night
we
shall
build
the
midsummer
fire
with
its
smaller
branches
what
are
you
crying
about
you
silly
girl
oh
please
do
cut
the
great
elm
begged
the
good
maiden
nonsense
said
the
i
wager
you
have
been
wasting
your
time
under
its
branches
i
shall
certainly
cut
the
tree
down
in
the
morning
all
night
long
you
may
be
sure
the
maiden
pondered
on
the
best
way
to
save
the
great
tree
and
since
she
was
as
clever
as
she
was
good
she
at
length
hit
upon
a
plan
rising
early
on
midsummer
morn
she
ran
to
the
forest
climbed
the
great
elm
and
concealed
herself
in
its
topmost
branches
she
saw
the
rest
of
the
wood
beneath
her
and
the
distant
peaks
of
the
adamant
mountains
and
she
rejoiced
in
the
dawn
songs
of
the
birds
an
hour
after
the
sun
had
risen
she
heard
the
voices
of
the
and
his
men
as
they
came
through
the
wood
soon
the
band
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
imagine
the
feelings
of
the
poor
prince
when
he
saw
the
sharp
axes
at
hand
to
cut
him
down
i
shall
strike
the
first
blow
said
the
chief
and
he
lifted
his
axe
in
the
air
suddenly
from
the
a
warning
voice
sang
throw
the
axe
down
harm
not
me
i
am
an
enchanted
tree
he
who
strikes
shall
breathe
his
last
before
midsummer
eve
hath
passed
there
is
a
spirit
in
the
tree
cried
the
woodcutters
thoroughly
frightened
let
us
hurry
away
from
here
before
it
does
us
a
mischief
and
in
spite
of
all
the
chief
remonstrances
they
ran
away
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
the
chief
however
was
and
lifted
the
axe
again
as
the
blade
shone
uplifted
in
the
sun
the
maiden
sang
once
more
throw
the
axe
down
harm
not
me
i
am
an
enchanted
tree
he
who
strikes
shall
breathe
his
last
before
midsummer
eve
hath
passed
hearing
the
voice
again
the
chief
began
to
feel
just
the
littlest
bit
alarmed
nevertheless
he
stood
his
ground
and
lifted
the
axe
a
third
time
once
more
the
girl
sang
throw
the
axe
down
harm
not
me
i
am
an
enchanted
tree
he
who
strikes
shall
breathe
his
last
before
midsummer
eve
hath
passed
at
the
same
moment
the
elm
managed
to
throw
down
a
great
branch
which
struck
the
rogue
a
sound
thump
on
the
shoulders
now
thoroughly
terrified
the
chief
himself
fled
from
the
spot
all
day
long
for
fear
lest
he
return
the
maiden
remained
hidden
in
the
tree
at
twilight
overcome
by
weariness
she
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
just
before
midnight
alas
she
was
awakened
from
her
slumber
by
hearing
an
angry
voice
cry
come
down
from
the
tree
wicked
deceitful
girl
or
i
shall
cut
it
down
at
once
very
much
alarmed
the
poor
maiden
looked
down
through
the
branches
and
discovered
the
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
elm
a
lantern
swung
from
his
left
hand
and
his
sharpest
axe
rested
on
his
right
shoulder
he
had
returned
home
and
not
finding
the
maiden
there
had
suspected
that
it
was
her
voice
which
had
frightened
his
men
away
come
down
roared
the
rascal
i
teach
you
you
minx
to
play
tricks
with
me
one
two
three
and
lifting
the
axe
in
the
air
he
was
about
to
send
it
crashing
into
the
trunk
of
the
elm
when
the
mysterious
murmur
which
heralded
the
coming
of
the
king
of
the
trees
sounded
through
the
wood
perplexed
and
frightened
again
the
chief
let
fall
his
axe
presently
he
perceived
two
beings
coming
toward
him
through
the
solemn
forest
uttering
a
howl
of
fear
the
rogue
would
have
fled
but
lifting
his
wand
the
elder
of
the
newcomers
transfixed
him
to
the
spot
the
two
personages
were
the
king
of
the
trees
and
his
friend
the
mighty
enchanter
gorbodoc
descend
and
fear
not
maiden
said
the
king
of
the
trees
you
have
done
bravely
and
well
your
misfortunes
are
over
and
a
happier
day
is
at
hand
so
the
brave
girl
hurried
down
the
tree
and
stood
before
the
enchanter
and
the
king
very
pretty
she
was
too
in
her
rustic
dress
and
ribbons
lifting
his
wand
with
great
solemnity
gorbodoc
touched
the
trunk
of
the
elm
there
was
a
blinding
flash
of
rosy
fire
the
great
tree
appeared
to
shrink
and
dissolve
and
presently
the
prince
stood
before
them
welcome
prince
said
the
enchanter
your
enemy
the
witch
will
trouble
you
no
more
i
have
turned
her
into
an
owl
and
given
her
to
the
queen
of
lantern
land
as
for
you
and
here
the
enchanter
turned
fiercely
upon
the
you
shall
be
a
green
monkey
until
you
have
planted
and
brought
to
full
growth
as
many
trees
as
you
have
cut
down
an
instant
later
a
green
monkey
swung
off
into
the
then
the
grateful
prince
thanked
the
king
of
the
trees
the
mighty
gorbodoc
and
the
brave
maiden
with
all
his
heart
i
am
glad
to
say
that
he
got
his
castle
back
again
and
married
the
maiden
who
had
saved
his
life
and
they
lived
happily
ever
after
the
bird
boy
late
one
autumn
night
a
young
queen
stood
by
her
window
gazing
upon
the
silent
and
deserted
meadows
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
suddenly
far
far
up
in
the
sky
she
heard
the
weird
cry
of
birds
flying
southward
and
lifting
her
eyes
the
queen
beheld
bird
after
bird
fly
across
the
golden
shield
of
the
moon
oh
lovely
happy
birds
said
she
would
that
i
might
have
a
son
with
wings
now
it
came
to
pass
that
before
the
harvest
moon
rose
again
over
the
land
the
queen
became
the
mother
of
a
little
boy
who
was
born
with
wings
on
his
shoulders
but
instead
of
being
pleased
with
so
strange
and
wonderful
a
little
son
the
king
who
was
very
superstitious
and
under
the
domination
of
wicked
chamberlain
named
malefico
took
it
into
his
head
that
his
wife
was
a
sorceress
and
gave
orders
that
she
should
be
imprisoned
in
a
lonely
tower
and
the
child
destroyed
so
the
queen
and
her
baby
were
taken
to
an
old
and
gloomy
tower
on
a
great
rock
overlooking
the
northern
sea
and
after
they
had
been
there
a
day
or
two
the
chief
jailer
came
to
the
queen
room
to
take
the
child
and
kill
him

approached
by
a

in

background
small

every
year
on
the
birthday
a
great
gray
bird
was
seen
the
queen
when
she
heard
this
terrible
order
uttered
a
gasping
scream
and
seizing
her
little
son
from
out
his
cradle
pressed
him
close
to
her
breast
but
although
she
fought
for
her
baby
with
all
her
might
the
rude
strength
of
the
jailers
prevailed
and
the
child
was
torn
from
its
mother
arms
then
before
anyone
could
prevent
her
the
poor
queen
beat
open
the
rotted
fastening
of
an
old
casement
window
sprang
upon
the
ledge
and
giving
one
last
look
of
love
and
tenderness
to
her
unhappy
child
leaped
down
into
the
sea
surging
and
pounding
over
the
rocks
hundreds
of
feet
below
she
certainly
would
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
had
not
a
good
spirit
of
the
ocean
taken
pity
on
her
and
changed
her
into
a
great
gray
bird
crying
mournfully
the
bird
circled
the
old
tower
thrice
and
disappeared
over
the
waters
in
spite
of
his
roughness
however
the
jailer
was
neither
a
brutal
nor
a
wicked
man
and
he
did
not
relish
the
cruel
task
which
the
king
had
given
him
so
instead
of
killing
the
he
carried
him
many
leagues
back
into
the
dark
forest
which
bordered
the
sea
and
gave
him
to
a
family
of
with
these
rough
good
people
the
lived
till
he
was
five
years
old
and
every
year
on
the
birthday
a
great
gray
bird
came
flying
over
the
forest
from
the
distant
ocean
circled
thrice
the
hut
and
disappeared
again
crying
mournfully
one
midsummer
day
with
a
great
deal
of
merry
hallooing
and
blowing
of
horns
the
king
of
the
country
accompanied
by
his
young
wife
came
hunting
through
the
wood
there
was
a
pretty
spring
near
the
door
of
the
hut
and
the
party
came
to
a
halt
at
its
edge
out
ran
the
winged
boy
and
his
two
little
to
see
the
wonderful
sight
and
a
wonderful
sight
it
was
indeed
to
see
the
horses
tossing
their
jeweled
bridles
the
hooded
falcons
riding
on
the
saddlebow
clutching
the
leather
with
their
curving
claws
the
merry
young
pages
in
their
dark
suits
and
all
the
gay
company
in
rich
attire
why
see
said
the
young
queen
to
her
husband
yon
little
boy
hath
wings
really
dear
i
must
have
him
for
my
page
would
it
be
wonderful
to
have
a
winged
page
besides
he
will
be
a
playmate
for
rosabella
so
the
king
gave
the
and
his
wife
fifty
pieces
of
bright
gold
which
pleased
them
very
much
and
the
himself
lifted
the
up
in
his
arms
and
placed
him
on
the
king
saddle
then
the
waved
to
his
two
little
ragged
who
were
howling
as
if
their
hearts
would
break
and
rode
away
with
the
king
in
a
few
hours
the
company
came
to
a
splendid
castle
of
shining
white
stone
standing
in
beautiful
green
gardens
running
down
to
the
sea
once
at
home
the
queen
commanded
that
the
little
winged
boy
be
washed
and
tidied
and
his
rags
replaced
with
a
pretty
black
velvet
suit
you
may
be
sure
that
when
the
was
washed
and
dressed
there
was
no
handsomer
more
winning
little
boy
in
all
the
world
so
the
became
the
best
beloved
playmate
of
the
queen
only
child
her
darling
rosabella
now
if
the
was
the
prettiest
little
boy
in
all
the
world
rosabella
was
the
prettiest
little
girl
moreover
she
had
a
sweet
disposition
which
is
a
gift
even
more
precious
than
the
gift
of
beauty
it
was
a
lovely
picture
to
see
the
children
building
toy
castles
on
the
floor
of
the
nursery
in
the
castle
tower
the
sun
streaming
on
the
hair
and
silver
white
wings
of
the
little
boy
and
on
the
golden
curls
of
rosabella
twelve
years
passed
the
grew
into
a
handsome
lad
rosabella
into
the
loveliest
of
princesses
twice
had
the
saved
rosabella
life
he
had
saved
her
the
first
time
by
swooping
down
and
catching
her
in
his
wings
just
as
she
was
about
to
tread
on
a
wicked
yellow
viper
he
had
saved
her
in
the
same
way
when
she
had
fallen
over
a
cliff
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
every
year
on
the
birthday
a
great
gray
bird
would
fly
in
from
over
the
sea
circle
the
castle
thrice
and
disappear
crying
mournfully
now
when
the
and
rosabella
were
in
their
seventeenth
year
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
was
summoned
to
war
his
enemy
was
no
other
than
the
wicked
chamberlain
malefico
who
had
succeeded
to
the
kingdom
of
the
father
when
that
prince
had
died
some
years
before
so
the
good
king
who
had
been
a
real
father
to
the
put
on
his
shining
armor
kissed
his
dear
wife
and
child
and
rode
off
to
the
battlefield
the
begged
and
pleaded
to
be
taken
with
him
as
his
squire
but
the
king
would
not
hear
of
it
and
insisted
that
he
remain
in
the
castle
to
take
care
of
the
queen
and
rosabella
there
was
little
cheer
in
the
castle
that
unhappy
evening
and
all
night
long
the
thought
he
could
hear
the
wings
of
a
great
bird
beating
fiercely
against
the
a
month
passed
an
unhappy
month
in
which
there
were
no
tidings
from
the
king
then
one
rainy
morning
a
messenger
who
had
ridden
so
hard
that
his
poor
horse
could
scarcely
stagger
rode
to
the
castle
gate
bearing
very
evil
news
a
great
battle
had
been
fought
the
army
of
father
had
been
completely
defeated
and
the
troops
of
the
wicked
malefico
were
hurrying
toward
the
castle
as
fast
as
they
could
come
and
so
it
was
for
before
the
queen
had
had
time
to
summon
the
people
and
gather
together
a
few
belongings
the
troops
of
the
enemy
burst
in
at
the
gate
and
a
dozen
fierce
soldiers
surrounded
the
queen
rosabella
and
the
and
dragged
them
to
malefico
when
malefico
saw
the
a
look
of
surprise
appeared
on
his
face
for
he
had
believed
that
the
wonderful
child
was
dead
then
he
fell
to
thinking
and
as
he
thought
wicked
purposes
swept
over
his
cruel
face
just
as
the
shadows
of
dark
clouds
sweep
over
a
gloomy
pool
if
it
were
known
that
the
winged
child
is
alive
he
thought
the
people
would
thrust
me
from
my
place
and
restore
him
to
his
throne
now
that
the
is
in
my
hands
i
will
destroy
him
and
be
sure
of
my
power
so
he
smiled
and
began
to
think
of
some
manner
in
which
he
could
bring
the
to
a
shameful
end
at
last
he
hit
upon
a
plan
he
would
declare
that
the
was
not
a
human
lad
at
all
but
a
he
would
then
accuse
the
good
king
of
having
protected
a
and
condemn
them
both
to
be
stoned
so
he
threw
the
king
and
the
queen
rosabella
and
the
into
an
old
and
went
through
the
mockery
of
having
a
trial
when
it
was
over
he
sent
a
soldier
to
tell
the
king
and
the
that
they
were
to
be
punished
the
following
day
and
now
dawned
the
unhappy
day
the
took
rosabella
hand
in
his
and
together
they
went
to
the
barred
window
of
the
prison
and
looked
out
upon
the
world
the
morning
was
fresh
and
fair
a
pleasant
southwest
wind
was
blowing
the
king
and
the
were
to
be
led
forth
at
noon
the
clock
marked
a
quarter
to
twelve
dear
rosabella
said
the
sadly
we
have
forgotten
that
is
the
day
on
which
the
great
gray
bird
comes
from
the
ocean
and
circles
the
castle
towers
if
thou
shouldst
see
the
bird
when
i
am
gone
greet
it
in
my
name
as
we
did
when
we
were
happy
children
the
bird
may
come
said
rosabella
amid
her
sobs
no
rosabella
said
the
i
shall
never
see
the
gray
bird
again
and
even
if
it
were
to
come
what
could
it
do
to
save
us
from
these
cruel
people
when
the
clock
stood
at
five
minutes
to
twelve
there
was
a
confused
noise
below
and
malefico
and
the
judges
who
shared
with
him
the
guilt
of
the
unrighteous
punishment
took
their
places
on
a
kind
of
platform
which
overlooked
the
place
of
execution
they
will
soon
be
coming
to
get
us
said
the
king
to
the
and
sure
enough
they
heard
the
jangle
of
the
jailer
keys
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
suddenly
the
sunlight
in
the
room
faded
swiftly
into
a
strange
gray
gloom
and
the
rushed
to
the
window
to
see
if
a
storm
was
at
hand
a
great
shadowy
cloud
advancing
with
inconceivable
rapidity
already
filled
half
the
sky
and
as
the
boy
gazed
into
this
cloud
he
saw
to
his
astonishment
that
it
was
not
a
cloud
at
all
but
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
great
gray
birds
flapping
their
long
wings
the
shadow
of
the
birds
fell
over
the
platform
on
which
the
cruel
malefico
sat
waiting
for
the
king
and
the
to
be
brought
forth
and
then
ceased
moving
even
as
a
ship
that
has
come
into
harbor
far
ahead
of
the
vast
swarm
flew
one
lonely
bird
and
suddenly
this
bird
uttered
a
shrill
and
piercing
cry
immediately
every
bird
let
fall
a
great
which
he
held
in
his
claws
and
for
a
long
minute
the
sky
rained
stones
round
polished
stones
that
fell
like
bolts
of
thunder
when
the
storm
was
over
and
the
cloud
had
begun
to
break
into
rifts
and
speckles
of
light
and
flapping
gray
wings
the
wicked
malefico
and
his
cruel
nobles
lay
buried
forever
beneath
mound
upon
mound
of
stones
the
doom
which
malefico
had
intended
for
another
had
overtaken
him
the
king
and
the
queen
rosabella
and
the
rushed
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
sunlight
as
they
did
so
the
gray
bird
who
had
led
the
cloud
sank
through
the
air
and
alighted
at
their
feet
but
scarcely
had
the
bird
claws
touched
the
ground
when
there
was
a
flash
of
flame
and
the
mother
stood
before
them
she
took
her
son
in
her
arms
and
told
them
all
his
history
and
her
misfortunes
and
how
she
had
watched
over
him
year
after
year
and
gathered
the
birds
to
save
him
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
troops
of
malefico
saw
their
former
queen
and
heard
her
story
they
acclaimed
the
as
their
rightful
king
and
carried
him
back
in
triumph
into
his
own
country
so
the
became
a
king
married
rosabella
and
lived
happily
ever
after
the
master
mariner
once
upon
a
time
a
fine
young
fisherman
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
sailed
alone
to
the
there
was
very
little
wind
and
beneath
the
speckled
clouds
and
the
cold
pearly
light
of
the
late
dawn
the
broad
low
billows
went
slowly
and
unrippled
to
the
land
the
fisherman
cast
anchor
and
threw
overboard
his
lines
suddenly
his
boat
moved
uneasily
and
close
to
its
side
the
oily
surface
of
the
pale
sea
broke
into
a
tumbling
mass
of
foam
in
the
heart
of
the
troubled
waters
the
fisherman
beheld
to
his
great
astonishment
a
man
clad
in
a
strange
garment
of
gleaming
black
scales
struggling
with
an
enormous
scarlet
fish
a
battle
of
life
and
death
they
fought
the
man
of
the
sea
trying
to
stab
the
fish
with
a
short
dagger
of
shining
steel
the
fish
trying
to
tear
at
the
body
of
its
enemy
now
with
a
swift
lash
of
its
bright
scarlet
body
the
fish
would
rush
at
the
man
now
with
a
long
sure
stroke
of
his
powerful
arms
the
man
would
escape
the
attack
suddenly
the
fish
hurled
itself
clear
out
of
the
water
and
falling
against
the
man
struck
him
a
terrible
blow
with
its
tail
then
the
ocean
man
who
was
stunned
for
a
moment
would
have
perished
had
not
the
young
fisherman
swiftly
seized
his
spear
and
plunged
deep
into
the
body
of
the
fish
mortally
wounded
the
scarlet
creature
sank
through
the
sunless
waters
the
dark
blood
flowing
from
its
side
the
man
of
the
sea
clutched
the
rail
of
the
boat
with
his
webbed
hands
and
said
to
the
fisherman
i
am
the
king
of
the
caves
of
the
sea
i
owe
you
my
life
and
you
shall
have
a
reward
take
this
little
silver
fish
it
will
bring
you
good
fortune
and
should
you
ever
be
in
deadly
peril
you
have
but
to
cast
it
into
the
sea
and
it
will
come
and
find
me
the
fisherman
thanked
the
king
of
the
caves
and
took
the
silver
fish
it
was
about
the
length
of
your
little
finger
and
had
pale
for
eyes
the
fisherman
hung
the
talisman
on
a
chain
and
wore
it
round
his
neck
from
that
morning
on
everything
prospered
with
the
youth
his
boat
never
leaked
he
was
never
caught
in
a
storm
and
the
fish
came
to
his
lines
and
nets
the
instant
he
threw
them
overboard
within
a
year
or
two
he
had
grown
so
rich
that
he
was
able
to
buy
the
finest
merchant
ship
in
the
world
and
became
a
master
mariner
surely
no
more
splendid
fellow
than
this
gallant
young
captain
was
ever
found
on
the
seven
seas
he
sailed
to
cold
and
foggy
flannel
land
where
the
inhabitants
all
have
incurable
head
colds
and
have
no
other
cloth
but
red
flannel
he
traded
in
the
ports
of
gorgeous
velvet
land
whose
inhabitants
dress
in
velvet
and
cover
their
walls
with
velvet
hangings
and
their
floors
with
velvet
rugs
one
pleasant
morning
running
before
a
fine
westerly
breeze
he
came
to
the
eastern
islands
down
the
street
of
the
bazaar
walked
the
master
mariner
followed
by
those
who
had
articles
to
sell
some
showed
him
birds
which
they
had
caught
in
the
forests
others
waved
squares
of
figured
cloth
and
called
upon
him
to
buy
them
others
still
offered
strange
flasks
and
bottles
of
brass
and
gleaming
copper
at
the
end
of
the
street
the
master
mariner
discovered
a
little
quiet
counter
on
which
lay
some
dozens
of
puffy
and
distended
bags
what
are
these
said
the
master
mariner
to
a
tall
lean
man
with
beady
brown
eyes
who
was
in
charge
of
the
shop
these
are
breezes
master
captain
replied
the
shopman
if
you
are
going
south
here
is
a
bag
of
a
very
reliable
northwest
wind
he
picked
up
one
of
the
brown
bags
if
you
are
going
east
here
are
some
of
the
westerly
gusts
i
am
selling
them
at
a
very
low
price
in
fact
at
less
than
they
cost
me
what
will
you
have
i
have
a
smart
easterly
replied
the
master
mariner
he
put
down
fifty
gold
pieces
on
the
counter
took
the
bag
which
the
shopman
gave
him
and
walked
away
now
all
these
leather
bags
looked
very
much
alike
and
instead
of
selling
the
master
mariner
a
brisk
easterly
breeze
the
shopman
had
made
an
error
and
sold
him
a
frightful
storm
again
the
master
mariner
went
to
sea
but
luckily
for
him
he
put
the
imprisoned
storm
away
in
a
locker
intending
to
use
it
on
some
other
voyage
presently
he
came
to
silk
land
loveliest
of
all
the
cloth
islands
there
the
inhabitants
dress
only
in
the
finest
of
silks
the
roofs
and
walls
are
covered
with
layers
of
silk
the
sun
always
shines
and
pretty
birds
with
silken
plumage
chatter
in
the
trees
illustration
man
falling
into
the
ocean
from
a
ship
with
a
large
white
sail
splash
and
the
master
mariner
fell
into
the
sea
now
the
island
of
silk
land
was
at
this
time
ruled
by
the
prettiest
of
princesses
she
was
about
eighteen
years
old
she
was
tall
for
her
age
and
her
eyes
were
quite
the
loveliest
shade
of
brown
when
the
master
mariner
fine
ship
came
into
the
harbor
of
silk
land
cleaving
the
turquoise
water
and
with
the
bright
sun
shining
on
her
sails
the
princess
happened
to
be
resting
under
a
silken
awning
on
the
roof
of
her
palace
catching
sight
of
the
ship
the
princess
cried
to
her
companions
see
what
a
fine
ship
is
coming
into
port
she
must
be
laden
with
many
wonderful
things
send
word
to
the
captain
that
i
intend
to
visit
her
morning
the
next
morning
sure
enough
the
princess
paid
a
visit
to
the
ship
which
lay
at
a
wharf
below
the
palace
in
honor
of
the
coming
everything
had
been
swept
scrubbed
and
brightened
and
gorgeous
carpets
from
the
eastern
islands
covered
the
decks
in
shaded
nooks
under
costly
tapestries
lay
the
treasures
of
the
cargo
wonderful
cloths
and
spices
from
the
eastern
islands
vessels
of
gold
and
silver
from
the
adamant
mountains
and
jewels
from
the
desert
of
the
moon
now
scarcely
had
the
master
mariner
set
eyes
on
the
princess
than
he
began
to
think
her
quite
the
most
wonderful
person
he
ever
had
beheld
as
for
the
princess
scarcely
had
the
master
mariner
directed
two
or
three
respectful
and
somewhat
tender
glances
in
her
direction
than
she
began
to
believe
him
quite
the
most
gallant
youth
she
had
ever
seen
she
gave
orders
that
several
of
the
marvels
be
brought
to
her
palace
and
was
looking
about
for
something
else
when
her
eyes
chanced
to
fall
upon
the
silver
fish
the
master
mariner
was
wearing
pray
what
is
that
little
silver
fish
asked
the
princess
a
mere
trifle
which
a
friend
once
gave
me
replied
the
master
mariner
reading
in
the
princess
eyes
and
demeanor
that
she
desired
the
talisman
if
your
majesty
will
only
deign
to
accept
it
it
is
yours
and
blinded
by
the
princess
eyes
he
gallantly
but
somewhat
incautiously
took
the
silver
fish
from
its
chain
and
gave
it
to
the
princess
who
laughed
prettily
and
accepted
the
gift
silver
trumpets
sounded
the
servitors
gathered
up
the
treasures
which
the
princess
had
chosen
and
the
royal
party
returned
to
the
palace
with
a
good
deal
of
chattering
and
laughter
in
a
few
days
the
master
mariner
disposed
of
his
cargo
and
went
again
to
sea
but
wherever
he
went
the
image
of
the
beautiful
princess
of
silk
land
went
with
him
under
the
silken
awning
on
the
balcony
sat
the
princess
and
the
image
of
the
young
captain
was
often
in
her
mind
after
three
months
had
passed
the
princess
took
it
into
her
head
that
it
was
time
for
the
master
mariner
to
return
to
silk
land
and
gave
orders
that
a
sharp
watch
be
kept
from
the
tower
of
the
palace
for
his
returning
vessel
one
morning
just
as
the
princess
was
having
breakfast
in
her
wonderful
silken
bed
news
was
brought
to
her
that
a
large
ship
was
headed
for
the
harbor
is
it
the
master
mariner
ship
asked
the
princess
i
do
not
know
your
majesty
replied
the
messenger
the
vessel
is
still
many
miles
out
to
sea
so
the
princess
jumped
out
of
bed
and
without
waiting
for
the
ladies
of
the
bedchamber
to
dress
her
ran
upstairs
to
her
balcony
a
great
ship
was
coming
in
under
a
favoring
breeze
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
till
the
princess
could
even
distinguish
the
men
aboard
suddenly
she
uttered
a
little
scream
and
ran
down
stairs
at
the
same
moment
the
bells
of
silk
land
all
began
to
ring
wildly
and
the
beating
of
drums
sounded
through
the
town
the
approaching
ship
was
a
pirate
ship
from
the
topmast
flew
the
terrible
black
flag
of
the
pirates
of
the
northern
isles
great
confusion
followed
warned
by
the
uproar
of
the
bells
and
drums
the
people
came
scurrying
through
the
streets
to
the
palace
some
carrying
children
in
their
arms
others
the
best
beloved
of
their
household
furnishings
the
palace
was
hastily
made
ready
for
a
siege
soon
cursing
and
swearing
the
pirates
arrived
and
began
to
sack
the
town
into
every
house
they
went
pulling
out
all
the
bureau
drawers
reading
private
letters
upsetting
the
clocks
and
leaving
the
water
running
in
the
kitchen
sinks
they
filled
their
pockets
with
and
watches
now
if
the
pirates
had
taken
only
the
cufflinks
cameo
brooches
silver
candlesticks
souvenir
spoons
and
and
then
gone
away
the
raid
would
not
have
been
too
terrible
but
the
rogues
bribed
by
the
horrid
old
king
of
the
oyster
mountains
a
rejected
suitor
were
bent
on
getting
possession
of
the
princess
on
discovering
that
she
had
locked
herself
up
in
the
strong
palace
their
rage
knew
no
bounds
they
made
a
dozen
different
attempts
to
break
open
the
palace
door
but
all
in
vain
finally
they
decided
to
besiege
the
fortress
for
four
days
all
went
well
enough
with
the
princess
and
her
imprisoned
people
but
by
the
sixth
day
most
of
the
food
had
been
eaten
and
by
the
end
of
the
eighth
day
the
princess
knew
she
would
have
to
surrender
the
following
morning
with
a
sinking
heart
she
went
to
a
turret
and
looked
out
over
the
ocean
in
the
hope
of
catching
sight
of
a
passing
sail
but
she
saw
only
the
deserted
town
and
the
pirate
ship
riding
at
anchor
in
the
bay
an
hour
later
she
went
to
the
turret
again
and
again
she
saw
no
sign
of
anything
at
sea
a
terrible
despair
seized
upon
her
but
nevertheless
once
more
to
the
turret
she
climbed
far
out
at
sea
headed
toward
land
was
the
brave
ship
of
the
master
mariner
so
great
was
the
joy
of
the
poor
princess
at
the
sight
of
the
gallant
vessel
that
she
almost
swooned
but
recovering
herself
like
the
princess
that
she
was
she
ran
down
into
the
courtyard
and
told
the
news
to
her
people
immediately
those
who
were
weak
or
fretful
from
hunger
began
to
take
heart
and
all
who
could
crowded
to
the
barred
windows
the
master
mariner
vessel
came
riding
into
the
port
the
watchers
saw
her
drop
anchor
saw
the
boats
being
lowered
and
the
sailors
coming
ashore
soon
the
pirates
and
the
sailors
were
at
it
hammer
and
tongs
a
ceaseless
clack
clack
of
steel
beating
upon
steel
rose
to
the
turrets
of
the
palace
there
were
dreadful
duels
in
the
alleyways
and
battles
in
the
public
squares
alas
just
as
the
sailors
were
carrying
the
day
the
master
mariner
received
a
blow
on
the
head
which
knocked
him
insensible
and
the
mariners
disorganized
by
the
loss
of
their
chief
were
soon
surrounded
and
taken
prisoners
then
taking
heart
the
pirates
rushed
the
palace
and
burst
open
the
doors
when
the
rogues
had
taken
everything
on
which
they
could
lay
their
hands
they
brought
the
prisoners
and
the
plunder
to
the
marketplace
shall
we
bind
all
these
people
and
take
them
aboard
asked
a
pirate
no
roared
the
pirate
chief
take
only
the
princess
and
that
rogue
of
a
master
mariner
the
people
now
began
to
cry
oh
do
take
the
princess
our
dear
princess
but
all
their
prayers
were
useless
now
because
the
master
mariner
ship
was
far
more
swift
and
beautiful
than
the
pirate
ship
the
pirates
after
setting
fire
to
their
own
vessel
abandoned
her
and
put
their
plunder
on
board
the
master
mariner
vessel
the
following
morning
leaving
the
people
of
silk
land
robbed
and
mourning
the
pirates
sailed
away
within
a
few
hours
all
signs
of
land
had
disappeared
the
sea
was
as
black
as
ink
against
the
horizon
edge
the
great
waves
were
leaping
and
breaking
into
foam
bring
me
the
list
of
booty
cried
the
pirate
captain
roaring
the
last
word
so
the
pirate
treasurer
came
on
deck
and
read
a
long
list
beginning
hooray
shouted
the
pirate
crew
a
hundred
and
sterling
silver
next
announced
the
treasurer
hooray
cried
the
crew
again
one
thousand
clocks
cried
the
treasurer
how
many
with
alarms
asked
an
old
pirate
anxiously
there
was
a
strained
silence
the
treasurer
consulted
his
list
seven
hundred
and
he
answered
hooray
yelled
the
pirate
crew
when
the
list
had
been
read
it
took
very
nearly
half
an
hour
to
do
it
the
captain
cried
bring
forth
the
master
mariner
so
the
master
mariner
was
brought
forth
and
thrown
brutally
against
a
mast
the
pirate
chief
put
his
arms
akimbo
cleared
his
throat
savagely
and
roared
so
you
thought
you
were
going
to
punish
me
did
you
well
i
show
you
what
happens
to
people
who
upset
my
plans
here
hawk
eye
and
you
toby
throw
this
fellow
overboard
hearing
this
awful
order
the
princess
screamed
and
would
have
run
to
the
master
mariner
had
not
rude
hands
restrained
her
splash
the
mariner
fell
into
the
inky
sea
swift
as
a
bird
his
own
ship
went
by
him
he
saw
the
mocking
face
of
the
pirate
chief
leering
at
him
from
over
the
rail
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
alone
all
all
alone
in
the
wide
wide
sea
for
some
time
he
swam
about
and
by
great
good
luck
discovered
a
log
of
wood
strong
enough
to
bear
his
weight
floating
near
at
hand
upon
this
he
climbed
and
there
we
shall
leave
him
for
the
present
when
the
captain
had
disappeared
from
sight
miles
behind
the
pirate
chief
walked
over
to
the
princess
and
looking
at
her
said
sneeringly
well
my
beauty
are
you
going
to
make
up
your
mind
to
be
the
wife
of
the
king
of
the
oyster
mountains
i
taking
you
to
him
and
mind
now
no
fooling
the
princess
shrank
from
him
with
horror
and
as
she
fell
back
the
sun
gleamed
on
the
silver
fish
she
was
wearing
at
her
throat
the
chief
made
a
rude
snatch
at
it
the
princess
however
was
quicker
than
he
and
hit
him
a
good
box
on
the
ear
ow
cried
the
chief
dancing
up
and
down
with
rage
i
fix
you
you
minx
here
somebody
tie
this
girl
to
the
mast
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
give
her
nothing
but
bread
and
water
in
obedience
to
his
order
the
princess
with
her
arms
tied
by
the
wrists
behind
her
back
was
lashed
to
the
mast
when
she
had
been
securely
bound
the
chief
whose
ear
was
still
tingling
took
the
silver
fish
he
was
looking
at
it
when
he
saw
something
which
made
him
drop
the
fish
on
the
deck
out
of
the
forecastle
door
thick
clouds
of
black
mist
were
rolling
exactly
as
if
the
hold
of
the
ship
were
on
fire
for
a
meddlesome
pirate
had
found
the
leather
bag
of
and
had
opened
it
mistaking
it
for
a
bag
of
wine
the
strange
clouds
swirling
round
the
deck
grew
instant
by
instant
darker
and
denser
soon
the
tops
of
the
masts
could
no
longer
be
distinguished
the
sun
took
on
a
horrible
copper
hue
and
the
sea
became
a
mottled
black
and
green
a
howling
wind
arose
a
moment
later
with
the
violence
of
an
explosion
the
storm
burst
rose
the
glassy
waves
the
lightning
fell
in
violet
cataracts
and
thunder
roared
and
tumbled
through
the
caverns
of
the
sky
an
ocean
of
hissing
rain
fell
into
the
waters
suddenly
the
pirate
chief
as
he
staggered
down
the
stairs
shouted
we
are
lost
just
astern
an
enormous
glassy
wave
higher
than
the
masts
of
the
ship
was
about
to
break
the
pirates
yelled
but
little
good
their
yelling
did
them
an
instant
later
the
wave
broke
upon
the
deck
and
crashing
tons
of
green
water
swept
every
single
pirate
into
the
sea
slowly
and
with
the
tense
struggle
of
a
wounded
animal
the
good
ship
lifted
itself
from
the
waves
the
princess
was
the
only
human
being
left
on
board
only
the
cords
which
bound
her
to
the
mast
had
saved
her
from
being
swept
away
now
when
the
water
swept
the
deck
the
silver
fish
which
lay
at
the
princess
feet
became
alive
and
darted
over
the
rail
into
the
sea
the
storm
continued
the
helpless
princess
expected
every
minute
to
sink
with
the
ship
into
the
roaring
waters
suddenly
to
her
horror
a
high
rocky
island
appeared
a
few
miles
ahead
toward
this
island
over
whose
cruel
reefs
the
ocean
was
foaming
and
breaking
the
ship
was
drifting
fast
tied
to
the
mast
the
princess
listened
to
the
terrible
cry
of
the
breakers
and
watched
the
jagged
rocks
of
the
island
ever
drawing
nearer
now
while
the
princess
was
in
this
terrible
situation
the
master
mariner
who
had
been
blown
before
the
storm
like
a
feather
also
came
in
sight
of
the
rocky
island
the
instant
he
caught
sight
of
the
shore
and
heard
the
roaring
of
the
breakers
he
knew
that
he
could
not
hope
to
reach
the
land
he
was
on
the
edge
of
the
reefs
when
the
king
of
the
caves
of
the
sea
who
had
been
summoned
by
the
silver
fish
rose
out
of
the
water
beside
him
and
taking
him
in
his
webbed
hands
swam
with
him
to
a
place
of
safety
just
as
they
reached
the
shallows
the
mists
of
the
tempest
parted
and
driving
through
the
darkness
and
the
storm
headed
for
the
reefs
came
the
master
mariner
ship
with
the
princess
tied
to
the
mast
oh
save
her
save
the
princess
cried
the
master
mariner
the
king
of
the
caves
of
the
sea
stretched
out
his
hands
over
the
island
and
uttered
a
strange
and
mysterious
word
so
awful
was
its
power
that
the
rocky
cliffs
split
open
forming
a
safe
and
sheltered
harbor
into
this
port
came
the
ship
safe
at
last
as
a
bird
in
its
nest
so
the
master
mariner
the
princess
and
the
ship
were
all
wonderfully
preserved
and
when
the
storm
was
over
the
king
of
the
caves
saw
them
home
to
silk
land
there
the
master
mariner
found
his
crew
waiting
for
him
and
in
a
few
days
they
had
rigged
new
sails
for
the
ship
which
were
even
whiter
than
the
old
the
inhabitants
got
back
the
scarf
pins
the
hundred
and
sterling
silver
the
thousand
clocks
and
the
rest
of
the
booty
which
the
pirates
had
stowed
away
in
the
master
mariner
ship
great
was
the
rejoicing
greater
still
was
the
joy
however
when
the
master
mariner
married
the
princess
the
marvelous
dog
and
the
wonderful

a

with

and
a

cat
seated
at
a
low
table
studying
books
and
making
notes
once
upon
a
time
there
was
an
old
enchanter
who
taught
magic
and
enchantment
to
the
younger
fairies
year
after
year
and
morning
after
morning
he
was
to
be
found
at
his
in
the
fairies
college
standing
between
his
desk
and
a
blackboard
now
writing
down
the
spell
for
turning
noses
into
turnips
now
changing
sunflower
seeds
into
pearls
before
the
very
eyes
of
his
pupils
the
old
enchanter
liked
this
life
of
quiet
and
study
and
doubtless
would
have
been
teaching
in
fairyland
to
this
very
day
had
he
not
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
quarrel
with
the
terrible
sorcerer
zidoc
who
was
then
lord
high
chancellor
of
the
fairies
college
i
have
forgotten
exactly
what
the
quarrel
was
about
but
i
think
that
it
had
to
do
with
the
best
spell
for
causing
castles
to
fall
to
pieces
in
an
instant
at
any
rate
zidoc
who
considered
himself
quite
the
most
wonderful
enchanter
in
fairyland
was
furious
at
being
opposed
and
told
the
old
enchanter
very
angrily
that
he
was
not
to
have
his
classes
any
more
and
must
leave
the
college
at
once
so
the
poor
old
gentleman
packed
up
his
magic
books
put
his
enchanter
wand
into
its
silver
case
and
went
to
the
country
one
pleasant
day
in
search
of
a
house
thanks
to
the
advice
of
a
friendly
chimney
swift
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
find
one
the
dwelling
was
the
property
of
the
fairy
jocapa
it
stood
just
off
the
high
road
close
by
a
lane
of
great
oaks
whose
shiny
fringed
leaves
glistened
in
the
hot
sun
it
had
a
high
roof
with
sides
steep
as
mountain
slopes
and
one
great
chimney
and
its
second
story
thrust
itself
out
over
the
first
in
the
way
green
fields
little
hills
and
pleasant
meadows
in
which
red
and
white
cows
were
grazing
lay
behind
the
dwelling
seeing
the
front
door
wide
open
the
enchanter
walked
in
it
was
very
quiet
only
the
far
away
of
a
could
be
heard
here
shall
i
live
said
the
enchanter
and
he
brought
his
possessions
to
the
house
now
one
autumnal
morning
when
a
blue
haze
hung
over
the
lonely
fields
from
which
the
reapers
had
departed
and
the
golden
leaves
were
wet
underfoot
the
old
enchanter
went
for
a
walk
down
the
lane
and
finding
the
day
agreeable
kept
on
until
he
found
himself
in
the
woods
arriving
at
the
crest
of
a
little
hill
in
the
woodland
he
saw
below
him
almost
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
a
countryman
with
a
white
puppy
and
a
black
kitten
following
at
his
heels
the
little
dog
barked
merrily
out
of
pure
high
spirits
whilst
the
kitten
leaped
and
struck
with
its
tiny
paws
at
the
passing
white
butterflies
as
the
old
enchanter
approached
the
countryman
he
happened
to
hear
him
say
to
the
animals
alas
my
poor
innocents
what
a
pity
that
i
should
have
to
abandon
you
what
that
said
the
enchanter
halting
the
countryman
you
intend
to
abandon
these
helpless
creatures
alas
i
must
replied
the
countryman
pulling
a
large
blue
bandanna
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
applying
it
to
the
corners
of
his
eyes
we
are
too
poor
to
be
able
to
feed
them
and
my
children
love
them
so
well
that
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
do
them
harm
i
am
taking
them
into
these
woods
to
abandon
them
in
the
hope
that
like
the
wild
animals
they
will
soon
learn
to
shift
for
themselves
give
them
to
me
said
the
old
enchanter
i
will
bring
them
up
the
countryman
nodded
his
head
as
for
you
here
is
a
golden
florin
may
it
bring
you
better
fortune
thus
did
the
white
puppy
and
black
kitten
change
hands
once
he
had
led
the
animals
safely
home
the
enchanter
resolved
to
make
them
the
most
wonderful
animals
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
the
whole
wide
world
whether
in
fairyland
or
out
of
it
being
an
enchanter
he
could
of
course
do
this
more
easily
than
other
people
so
he
taught
the
cat
and
the
dog
all
the
known
languages
then
history
arithmetic
dancing
social
deportment
and
a
variety
of
the
best
magic
and
spells
the
cat
as
was
to
be
expected
was
particularly
good
on
anything
that
had
in
it
he
once
catalogued
all
the
principal
catastrophes
while
the
dog
although
a
good
student
had
a
fancy
for
writing
doggerel
many
and
many
a
time
when
the
enchanter
and
his
wonderful
animals
were
seated
in
their
armchairs
round
a
blazing
fire
talking
exactly
as
any
three
good
friends
might
talk
a
nose
would
flatten
itself
against
the
panes
and
the
three
companions
would
see
looking
in
at
them
some
stranger
whose
curiosity
had
got
the
better
of
his
manners
the
dog
i
may
say
had
grown
up
to
be
a
fine
fellow
of
the
white
bull
terrier
family
the
cat
had
grown
to
be
as
aristocratic
as
a
panther
when
their
education
was
complete
the
animals
came
to
their
teacher
and
begged
him
to
let
them
go
away
and
see
the
world
for
a
long
time
the
enchanter
who
loved
his
charges
very
much
indeed
resisted
their
request
but
as
they
continued
to
press
him
he
came
at
length
to
yield
calling
them
before
him
he
said
to
them
well
dear
pupils
if
you
must
go
you
must
go
i
owe
the
fairy
jocapa
twelve
months
rent
for
this
house
she
is
now
living
with
her
nephew
the
king
of
the
land
of
the
runaway
rivers
you
shall
take
twelve
golden
florins
to
her
your
route
will
take
you
over
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
whole
wide
world
so
the
white
dog
who
was
the
stronger
of
the
two
took
the
purse
with
the
twelve
golden
coins
and
put
it
in
a
large
wallet
which
he
wore
at
his
side
and
then
both
the
wonderful
animals
said
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
they
turned
again
to
look
for
the
last
time
at
their
dwelling
and
saw
their
old
master
still
waving
at
them
from
the
little
window
over
the
door
then
they
fared
over
the
hills
and
far
away
so
wise
so
and
were
these
wonderful
animals
that
their
journey
across
the
world
was
a
great
success
from
the
beginning
their
fame
spread
from
kingdom
to
kingdom
like
the
universities
colleges
and
other
learned
societies
fought
with
each
other
for
the
privilege
of
entertaining
these
distinguished
students
to
this
very
day
the
address
which
the
cat
made
on
catapults
and
cataplasms
before
the
professors
of
the
university
of
sagessa
is
remembered
as
one
of
the
great
events
of
the
time
while
the
address
on
dogma
before
the
assembled
scholars
of
the
royal
academy
of
fairyland
was
printed
in
a
special
book
bound
in
gold
leaf
and
walpus
leather
both
the
cat
and
the
dog
were
awarded
countless
honorary
decorations
and
so
little
by
little
they
came
to
a
hilly
land
in
which
all
the
streams
raced
to
the
sea
and
there
they
knew
themselves
to
be
in
the
kingdom
of
the
runaway
rivers
a
three
days
journey
brought
them
to
the
royal
castle
arriving
in
the
twilight
they
were
somewhat
surprised
to
find
a
number
of
torchbearers
waiting
for
them
in
the
castle
courtyard
with
great
respect
these
attendants
conducted
the
cat
and
the
dog
into
a
little
and
then
retired
leaving
them
alone
a
few
minutes
later
a
very
old
woman
who
the
animals
noticed
was
came
to
take
them
before
the
king
how
strange
whispered
the
cat
in
its
rather
voice
very
whispered
back
the
dog
in
his
deeper
tone
having
opened
one
after
the
other
three
great
doors
with
three
different
iron
keys
the
old
woman
guiding
herself
by
touching
the
wall
with
her
hand
led
the
animals
into
a
long
dark
corridor
the
cat
who
could
see
quite
well
in
the
dark
did
not
mind
this
but
the
dog
was
not
particularly
pleased
the
echoes
of
the
old
woman
boots
went
rolling
along
in
the
hollow
darkness
the
dog
could
hear
his
heart
beat
and
saw
his
black
companion
eyes
glowing
like
pools
of
flame
then
to
their
mutual
relief
the
animals
saw
a
point
of
light
appearing
far
down
the
passage
and
on
reaching
this
they
discovered
a
second
blind
old
woman
holding
a
torch
the
first
old
woman
beckoned
them
to
follow
this
new
guide
and
disappeared
again
into
the
dark
corridors
by
which
they
had
arrived
the
second
old
woman
lifting
high
the
torch
first
led
her
charges
through
three
more
great
doors
all
of
which
she
carefully
locked
behind
her
soon
the
animals
found
themselves
at
the
top
of
a
winding
stair
whose
end
was
lost
in
darkness
down
this
stair
they
went
turning
ever
turning
down
and
round
down
and
round
till
both
cat
and
dog
felt
dizzily
that
they
must
have
reached
the
heart
of
the
earth
then
little
by
little
a
of
light
began
to
glow
brighter
and
brighter
and
the
animals
found
themselves
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
opposite
a
little
door
and
there
by
this
door
stood
another
blind
old
woman
who
held
a
torch
and
beckoned
to
the
animals
to
follow
three
more
doors
they
passed
the
last
one
opening
on
a
very
narrow
winding
passage
in
and
out
they
turned
walking
one
behind
the
other
for
a
time
that
seemed
very
very
long
suddenly
a
narrow
door
appeared
in
the
winding
wall
which
opened
inward
as
they
drew
near
revealing
a
beautiful
round
chamber
richly
furnished
and
hung
with
the
finest
tapestries
beside
the
fireplace
in
which
a
was
cheerily
burning
sat
a
lady
who
was
no
other
than
the
fairy
jocapa
and
in
the
centre
of
the
room
reading
a
great
book
by
the
light
of
many
candles
sat
a
young
man
the
king
in
spite
of
the
enchanter
careful
training
in
manners
the
cat
and
the
dog
i
am
sorry
to
say
almost
stared
for
an
instant
at
the
king
small
wonder
that
they
did
so
for
the
unfortunate
young
man
lay
under
a
horrid
spell
and
his
face
and
hands
were
not
pink
or
white
or
like
yours
or
mine
but
bright
green
like
a
parrot
wing
welcome
o
wonderful
animals
said
the
enchanted
king
your
fame
has
gone
before
you
into
every
land
and
it
is
said
that
there
is
no
question
you
can
not
answer
listen
then
to
my
story
and
help
me
if
you
can
you
see
me
before
you
hideously
changed
until
you
entered
here
an
instant
past
no
eyes
but
those
of
my
aunt
had
beheld
my
horrible
countenance
it
was
she
who
caused
this
enchanted
chamber
to
appear
in
the
heart
of
the
foundations
of
my
castle
and
in
this
chamber
i
have
hidden
since
that
terrible
hour
when
the
spell
was
put
upon
me
my
subjects
only
know
that
i
am
still
alive
the
lord
chancellor
rules
the
kingdom
in
my
stead
but
hearken
to
my
story
ten
months
ago
as
i
was
driving
my
chariot
down
a
narrow
road
built
along
a
close
to
the
stream
i
encountered
a
chariot
being
driven
furiously
in
the
opposite
direction
the
driver
of
the
chariot
was
a
tall
elderly
man
wearing
a
wizard
cap
his
face
was
red
as
with
anger
an
evil
light
gleamed
in
his
small
malicious
eyes
in
order
to
let
him
pass
i
turned
to
one
side
as
near
to
the
as
i
dared
but
the
space
was
too
narrow
our
chariots
locked
wheels
and
his
was
overthrown
turning
upon
me
a
face
aflame
with
hatred
he
cried
out
will
teach
you
what
it
is
to
offend
the
enchanter
zidoc
and
an
instant
later
the
wizard
himself
the
struggling
horses
and
the
overturned
chariot
disappeared
in
a
rumble
of
thunder
and
a
great
flash
of
flame
i
turned
homeward
never
noticing
that
anything
had
happened
to
me
as
i
chanced
to
pass
a
roadside
cottage
a
little
child
playing
about
saw
me
and
ran
screaming
for
fear
to
the
door
a
little
farther
on
i
stopped
to
drink
of
a
spring
judge
of
my
horror
when
i
leaned
over
the
clear
pool
of
water
and
saw
that
my
face
had
turned
a
bright
green
i
waited
till
nightfall
stole
into
the
castle
unobserved
and
sought
the
aid
of
my
aunt
the
fairy
you
know
the
rest
speak
o
wonderful
dog
and
wonderful
cat
and
bid
me
hope
a
little
and
the
poor
king
hid
his
bright
green
face
in
his
hands
the
enchanter
zidoc
is
an
old
enemy
of
our
dear
master
said
the
white
dog
and
his
power
as
a
sorcerer
is
the
greatest
in
fairyland
i
have
tried
all
my
powers
against
him
in
vain
said
the
fairy
jocapa
sadly
but
let
us
not
despair
broke
in
the
cat
zidoc
is
now
to
be
found
in
these
dominions
his
castle
lies
on
the
border
of
the
silver
hills
the
dog
and
i
will
go
there
and
see
if
we
can
help
the
king
so
the
fairy
and
the
unhappy
king
thanked
the
wise
animals
and
sent
for
the
blind
old
women
to
lead
them
back
to
the
upper
world
early
next
morning
the
famous
pair
began
the
journey
to
the
enchanter
den
the
dog
plan
was
to
pretend
to
be
but
an
everyday
stray
dog
and
to
this
end
he
rolled
several
times
in
a
the
cat
too
was
to
appear
as
a
stray
cat
and
neglected
his
fine
black
coat
in
order
to
look
the
part
unfortunately
for
their
plan
zidoc
had
in
his
chamber
a
little
enchanted
bell
which
rang
shrilly
when
danger
threatened
him
hearing
the
bell
ring
late
at
night
zidoc
rose
from
his
bed
and
hurrying
to
the
turret
window
saw
by
the
light
of
the
waning
moon
the
dog
and
the
cat
making
their
way
to
the
castle
through
the
wood
rubbing
his
hands
with
glee
he
determined
to
let
the
two
animals
walk
headlong
into
his
power
and
then
inflict
upon
them
some
terrible
revenge
the
first
day
the
dog
went
indoors
and
concealed
himself
under
a
sofa
while
the
cat
remained
outside
when
twilight
came
the
dog
ran
out
and
met
the
cat
in
the
castle
garden
did
you
discover
anything
asked
the
cat
nothing
whatever
replied
the
dog
i
will
try
said
the
cat
and
so
when
the
morning
came
the
dog
remained
outside
while
the
cat
concealed
himself
behind
a
curtain
when
the
twilight
came
the
animals
met
again
did
you
discover
anything
asked
the
dog
very
little
replied
the
cat
the
sorcerer
serponel
is
coming
to
pay
zidoc
a
visit
one
of
us
must
hide
in
the
room
in
which
they
will
talk
for
perhaps
we
may
learn
something
which
may
help
us
to
lift
the
spell
from
the
king
it
is
my
turn
said
the
dog
and
so
the
next
morning
he
stole
into
the
house
and
hid
again
beneath
the
sofa
now
zidoc
knew
very
well
where
the
dog
had
concealed
himself
moreover
he
had
summoned
the
powerful
serponel
to
his
aid
in
order
that
the
dog
and
the
cat
should
have
no
opportunity
to
escape
when
serponel
arrived
both
the
wicked
enchanters
went
to
the
room
in
which
the
dog
lay
concealed
first
zidoc
locked
the
only
door
with
a
great
key
and
then
he
said
to
serponel
brother
someone
tells
me
that
there
is
an
enemy
hidden
under
the
sofa
yes
brother
replied
the
dreadful
serponel
and
something
tells
me
that
it
is
time
to
let
him
feel
your
staff
now
zidoc
had
an
enchanted
staff
whose
blows
were
mortal
and
knowing
this
the
poor
dog
who
was
trapped
between
the
wall
and
the
two
sorcerers
grew
cold
with
fear
to
the
tip
of
his
white
tail
just
as
he
was
about
to
make
a
bolt
into
the
open
zidoc
dragged
the
sofa
swiftly
aside
and
aimed
a
terrible
blow
at
him
which
by
the
greatest
good
luck
just
missed
its
mark
he
then
ran
out
into
the
room
pursued
by
the
sorcerers
who
little
by
little
forced
him
toward
a
corner
and
now
just
as
zidoc
holding
the
staff
uplifted
was
about
to
strike
the
poor
dog
with
all
his
force
a
black
shape
with
flaming
eyes
and
paws
outstretched
to
scratch
leaped
through
the
open
window
and
landed
upon
zidoc
back
it
was
the
brave
cat
who
had
heard
the
fracas
from
his
below
and
had
clawed
his
way
up
the
castle
wall
to
help
his
friend
valiant
puss
forgetting
in
one
instant
i
must
admit
all
its
knowledge
of
languages
catastrophes
history
social
deportment
and
agriculture
plunged
instantly
into
the
fray
and
gave
zidoc
a
frightful
scratch
which
so
upset
him
that
it
caused
him
to
drop
his
staff
while
the
dog
profiting
by
the
confusion
and
forgetting
all
about
geometry
mathematics
agriculture
and
dogma
managed
to
give
serponel
a
good
bite
just
above
the
ankle
the
wily
zidoc
however
was
not
to
be
so
easily
thwarted
uttering
a
magic
word
he
caused
the
room
to
be
filled
with
darkness
and
in
the
cover
of
this
darkness
he
transformed
himself
instantly
into
a
black
cat
exactly
like
the
learned
cat
while
serponel
changed
himself
into
a
white
dog
exactly
like
the
learned
dog
at
the
same
moment
he
caused
the
locked
door
to
fly
open
now
thought
he
i
will
cause
the
cat
to
follow
the
wrong
white
dog
and
the
dog
to
follow
the
wrong
cat
we
shall
thus
separate
the
animals
and
when
we
have
lured
them
far
away
from
each
other
serponel
and
i
will
resume
our
true
forms
and
destroy
these
meddlesome
creatures
when
the
darkness
cleared
the
hearts
of
the
true
animals
fell
for
fear
lest
the
sorcerer
ruse
be
successful
but
they
met
the
challenge
readily
and
instead
of
fleeing
stood
their
ground
the
true
dog
battling
with
the
false
dog
the
real
cat
with
the
false
cat
never
was
such
a
hullaballoo
heard
in
fairyland
then
seeing
that
he
was
in
danger
of
being
badly
scratched
zidoe
brought
on
another
darkness
the
floor
of
the
castle
shook
a
noise
as
of
thunder
roared
and
rattled
through
the
room
when
the
darkness
ended
both
the
enchanters
had
been
separated
and
the
cats
were
confused
the
real
dog
was
chasing
the
real
cat
thinking
that
he
was
following
zidoc
while
serponel
who
had
been
the
false
white
dog
was
pursuing
zidoc
who
had
been
the
false
black
cat
down
the
stairs
over
the
terraces
and
the
gardens
ran
the
true
dog
pursuing
the
true
cat
while
indoors
up
and
down
through
the
rooms
and
over
the
furniture
raced
the
false
animals
the
poor
cat
thinking
he
was
being
pursued
by
the
wrong
dog
grew
short
of
breath
and
hearing
the
snapping
at
his
heels
ran
up
a
convenient
tree
hardly
had
he
reached
a
point
above
the
dog
jaws
when
a
voice
said
why
my
pupils
my
pupils
what
a
way
to
behave
stop
your
quarreling
this
instant
the
animals
turned
to
look
and
saw
their
master
the
old
enchanter
he
had
been
worried
by
their
long
absence
and
had
gone
forth
to
look
for
them
thus
at
the
same
moment
that
the
poor
dog
saw
that
he
had
been
pursuing
his
friend
the
cat
saw
that
he
had
been
escaping
from
his
comrade
suddenly
a
noise
from
the
castle
arrested
their
attention
and
on
looking
up
all
saw
through
the
windows
the
false
dog
pursuing
the
false
cat
down
the
hall
of
state
now
if
you
remember
the
first
part
of
this
story
you
will
recall
that
zidoc
quarreled
with
the
old
enchanter
over
the
right
spell
for
destroying
castles
a
triumphant
smile
shone
on
the
lips
of
the
old
teacher
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
toward
the
castle
and
uttered
a
magic
word
there
was
a
roar
as
of
twenty
thousand
cataracts
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
castle
collapsed
in
a
cloud
of
dust
burying
the
two
wicked
magicians
in
its
ruins
there
i
told
him
so
said
the
old
enchanter
when
the
dog
and
the
cat
had
recovered
from
the
events
of
the
day
the
three
friends
began
their
journey
back
to
the
palace
of
the
enchanted
king
he
came
to
the
castle
gate
to
meet
them
for
zidoc
overthrow
had
broken
the
spell
which
had
so
oddly
disfigured
him
through
the
open
doors
a
splendid
banquet
could
be
seen
waiting
and
the
sound
of
music
was
heard
so
the
old
enchanter
gave
his
arm
to
the
fairy
jocapa
the
prince
gave
his
to
the
white
dog
and
the
cat
followed
all
by
himself
then
came
the
host
of
rejoicing
courtiers
when
the
festival
was
over
the
enchanter
and
the
wonderful
animals
went
back
loaded
with
royal
gifts
to
their
own
little
house
and
lived
happily
there
to
a
good
old
age
the
shepherd

man
and

elves

pour
through
a
large
gate
once
upon
a
time
a
young
husband
and
wife
named
giles

phyllida
lived
in
a
cottage
in
the
heart
of
a
great
plain
league
upon
league
the
rich
land
fell
away
to
the
west
there
to
end
at
a
wall
of
high
mountains
into
whose
fastnesses
no
one
had
ever
ventured
yet
the
mountains
were
very
beautiful
in
the
cold
of
a
clear
winter
day
the
snowy
summits
and
pinnacles
shone
bright
and
near
at
hand
in
the
spring
fogs
hid
them
and
lay
like
gray
mantles
upon
the
lower
slopes
midway
in
the
mountain
wall
a
wide
chasm
marked
the
entrance
to
a
deep
gloomy
valley
out
of
which
a
roaring
mountain
torrent
hurried
to
lose
itself
in
the
plain
below
and
because
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
this
dark
valley
storms
were
brewed
whose
dark
clouds
laden
with
lightning
and
hail
poured
from
between
the
crags
of
the
valley
out
over
the
land
this
valley
was
known
as
the
valley
of
thunder
according
to
an
old
legend
out
of
this
valley
a
king
should
one
day
come
to
rule
over
the
people
of
the
plain

the
waving
grain
and
phyllida
watching
from
a
window
would
see
the
sun
flash
on
the
uplifted
blade
of
her
husband
scythe
one
day
phyllida
said
to
giles
i
have
made
a
dress
for
the
youngest
child
of
our
cousins
jack
and
jill
and
this
morning
i
shall
saddle
the
white
horse
and
ride
over
to
their
cottage
perhaps
i
may
stay
with
them
for
a
few
days
you
will
find
a
fresh
baking
of
bread
and
a
in
the
larder
giles
i
soon
be
home
again
so
giles
answered
and
away
rode
phyllida
on
the
white
horse
a
few
days
passed
and
giles
wandering
here
and
there
through
the
quiet
house
felt
very
lonely
indeed
finally
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
said
to
himself
phyllida
must
be
on
her
way
home
now
i
shall
walk
down
the
highway
and
meet
her
so
he
turned
all
the
animals
loose
in
the
fields
and
putting
a
few
slices
of
bread
and
cheese
in
his
pockets
set
forth
upon
the
road
leagues
ahead
of
him
stood
the
mysterious
mountains
rising
palely
through
the
haze
of
the
midsummer
afternoon
a
pale
violet
light
fell
on
their
distant
precipices
and
the
snow
in
the
rifts
upon
their
sides
appeared
of
the
purest
and
loveliest
white
gusts
of
wind
hurrying
from
the
distant
summits
swept
the
great
plain
and
the
fields
of
ripening
wheat
bent
before
them
and
rustled
harshly
suddenly
down
the
throat
of
the
thunder
valley
giles
saw
a
river
of
lightning
fall
and
from
far
away
came
a
low
murmur
of
thunder
then
faster
and
faster
a
storm
poured
down
the
chasm
like
a
flood
drowning
out
the
light
of
the
sun
stilling
the
songs
of
the
little
birds
and
turning
to
the
sky
the
pale
underside
of
the
leaves
of
the
roadside
trees
a
darkness
as
of
night
itself
covered
the
land
rain
began
to
fall
in
great
spattering
drops
now
by
the
glare
of
the
lightning
giles
would
see
the
endless
fields
drenched
and
waving
in
the
rain
now
the
thunder
valley
itself
covered
with
a
floor
of
onrushing
cloud
unfolding
turning
and
sinking
in
continuous
and
multitudinous
activity
night
came
on
amid
the
storm
and
a
flash
of
lightning
revealed
to
giles
that
he
had
lost
his
way
hoping
to
find
a
shelter
or
some
friendly
cottage
however
he
plunged
on
but
the
road
became
worse
and
worse
and
he
was
again
and
again
forced
to
wade
brooks
flooded
by
the
tempest
at
length
his
steps
led
him
into
a
pine
wood
and
there
in
the
thickest
part
he
found
a
little
shelter
and
fell
asleep
when
he
woke
numb
cramped
and
cold
he
found
to
his
horror
that
in
the
night
and
darkness
he
had
blundered
on
into
the
valley
of
thunder
into
which
no
living
soul
had
ever
before
advanced
worst
of
all
he
could
not
find
the
way
by
which
he
had
entered
for
high
crags
rose
on
every
side
and
held
him
prisoner
presently
to
his
amazement
he
beheld
a
narrow
flight
of
steps
cut
in
the
solid
rock
of
the
mountainside
up
these
steps
climbed
giles
and
as
he
mounted
higher
the
stairs
began
to
twist
and
turn
amid
the
crags
and
pinnacles
at
the
end
of
an
ascent
he
found
himself
at
a
turn
from
which
the
thunder
valley
the
chasm
through
which
it
opened
into
the
plain
and
the
wide
plain
itself
could
all
be
seen
giles
lingered
there
a
while
trying
to
see
his
own
cottage
or
perhaps
phyllida
on
her
white
horse
but
he
could
see
neither
one
nor
the
other
so
he
began
to
climb
again
all
day
long
he
climbed
and
climbed
and
climbed
twilight
fell
the
circle
of
the
sun
dropped
below
the
level
horizon
of
the
distant
fields
one
still
golden
star
hung
on
the
fringe
of
the
the
stairs
began
to
widen
and
presently
giles
found
himself
at
the
summit
of
the
mountain
before
his
eyes
lay
a
little
level
field
surrounded
by
strange
crags
and
pinnacles
looming
tall
and
black
against
the
stars
and
as
giles
rubbed
his
eyes
in
wonder
lights
shone
here
and
there
in
the
sides
of
the
towering
rocks
even
as
lights
shine
in
the
windows
of
a
village
when
you
see
it
from
afar
giles
rubbed
his
eyes
again
lights
what
could
they
mean
presently
a
great
door
cut
in
the
side
of
a
towering
mass
of
stone
opened
with
a
burst
of
light
and
toward
giles
there
hurried
the
two
strangest
creatures
whom
he
had
ever
seen
these
were
two
elves
alike
as
two
peas
and
each
about
three
feet
tall
instead
of
having
ears
much
like
other
elves
however
the
first
one
had
ears
like
great
curved
cornucopias
which
projected
almost
a
foot
on
each
side
of
his
enormous
round
head
while
the
other
whose
ears
were
quite
natural
had
but
one
huge
eye
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
without
saying
a
single
word
these
strange
elves
seized
giles
by
the
hands
and
after
hurrying
him
across
the
open
space
urged
him
through
the
open
doors
into
the
house
in
the
crags
still
keeping
silence
the
elves
led
giles
through
hundreds
of
splendid
rooms
and
great
halls
all
lighted
by
hanging
lamps
as
countless
in
number
as
the
leaves
upon
the
trees
suddenly
a
great
archway
rose
before
them
through
which
appeared
a
hall
larger
and
brighter
than
all
the
others
seen
before
at
one
end
of
it
under
a
canopy
of
stood
a
golden
throne
and
on
the
throne
sat
a
being
dressed
in
radiant
blue
in
blue
such
as
the
sky
wears
after
a
rain
when
the
dark
clouds
with
bright
edges
break
asunder
and
reveal
the
glory
overhead
at
the
same
moment
the
countless
mountain
elves
gathered
in
the
hall
began
to
sing
all
hail
all
hail
to
the
shepherd
of
clouds
who
high
in
his
rules
the
weather
he
sends
the
rich
rain
over
mountain
and
plain
and
sprinkles
the
afar
the
heather
the
elves
led
giles
before
the
shepherd
how
comest
thou
mortal
to
invade
my
mountain
said
the
shepherd
i
went
forth
to
seek
phyllida
said
giles
and
lost
my
way
in
the
storm
what
sayest
thou
said
the
shepherd
to
the
elf
with
the
single
great
eye
in
his
forehead
the
mortal
speaks
the
truth
answered
in
the
queerest
squealiest
voice
i
saw
him
set
out
yesterday
from
his
cottage
on
the
plain
he
had
not
gone
far
when
the
storm
which
your
mightiness
prepared
in
the
morning
and
sent
forth
in
the
afternoon
overtook
him
he
lost
his
way
and
chance
led
him
to
your
dwelling
o
shepherd
of
clouds
what
sayest
thou
said
the
shepherd
to
the
elf
with
the
great
ears
i
heard
him
say
to
his
wife
wednesday
last
replied
the
elf
in
a
voice
exactly
like
that
of
his
brother
phyllida
said
to
him
will
find
a
fresh
baking
of
bread
and
a
in
the
larder
the
shepherd
of
clouds
fixed
his
deep
solemn
gaze
upon
giles
and
said
mortal
i
have
hearkened
to
your
story
and
to
the
words
of
my
faithful
who
sees
all
things
that
happen
in
the
whole
wide
world
i
have
paid
heed
to
the
words
of
who
hears
all
things
that
are
to
be
heard
under
the
sun
chance
has
led
you
to
discover
the
secret
of
the
weather
nevermore
must
you
revisit
the
lower
world
here
shall
you
stay
till
death
overtakes
you
obey
me
and
i
will
give
you
happiness
and
honor
seek
to
escape
and
my
lightnings
will
find
you
wheresoever
you
may
hide
oh
no
no
no
cried
poor
giles
throwing
himself
down
before
the
throne
great
shepherd
of
clouds
do
not
keep
me
here
let
me
return
to
my
cottage
on
the
plain
to
phyllida
who
waits
for
me
and
knows
not
whither
i
am
gone
or
whether
i
am
living
or
dead
oh
let
me
go
let
me
go
but
the
shepherd
only
shook
his
head
austerely
and
rising
from
his
throne
disappeared
behind
the
curtains
again
the
mountain
elves
sang
and
as
they
sang
the
great
hall
slowly
grew
darker
than
the
darkest
night
and
cold
gusts
of
wind
arose
wailing
in
the
darkness
presently
giles
felt
his
body
grow
weak
strong
hands
seized
him
and
bore
him
up
and
an
instant
later
a
deep
sleep
blotted
out
the
world
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
in
a
little
room
dawn
was
at
hand
and
the
sweet
cold
mountain
air
was
blowing
through
the
eastern
window
suddenly
the
door
swung
open
and
and
entered
the
sun
is
rising
giles
said
and
your
appointed
task
awaits
you
the
shepherd
wishes
the
clouds
released
at
once
hurry
hurry
hurry
giles
and
open
their
so
giles
went
forth
with
the
elves
over
the
summit
of
the
mountain
they
ran
along
a
path
which
wandered
here
and
there
now
dodging
between
huge
boulders
now
skirting
terrible
precipices
presently
giles
saw
a
monstrous
wall
of
rock
rising
before
him
in
which
were
fixed
two
brazen
doors
taller
and
more
stately
than
he
had
ever
seen
in
the
world
below
beside
these
doors
a
flight
of
steps
began
which
led
to
the
top
of
the
wall
curious
to
see
what
lay
behind
the
wall
and
the
closed
doors
giles
hurried
to
the
top
he
found
himself
standing
at
the
brink
of
a
great
bowl
many
miles
wide
and
many
miles
long
hollowed
out
of
the
very
rock
of
the
mountaintop
within
this
bowl
like
a
giant
flock
of
sheep
lay
hundreds
of
clouds
on
whose
misty
tops
the
rising
sun
poured
gold
pale
lavender
and
rose
at
first
giles
thought
them
motionless
but
as
he
gazed
intently
within
the
bowl
he
saw
that
the
clouds
moved
and
swayed
much
like
anchored
ships
in
a
tide
this
bowl
was
the
in
it
the
shepherd
of
clouds
prepared
the
weather
for
the
neighboring
countries
one
day
he
would
keep
the
clouds
at
home
and
let
the
sail
over
the
land
on
another
day
he
would
keep
all
the
clouds
in
and
let
the
sun
shine
on
other
days
he
would
mix
together
such
frosts
mists
and
as
the
season
required
suddenly
ringing
infinitely
sweet
over
the
rose
the
clear
music
of
a
silver
horn
it
is
the
shepherd
cried
and
the
hour
is
at
hand
to
send
the
clouds
over
the
earth
quick
giles
unbar
the
doors
so
giles
unbound
the
giant
doors
which
of
their
own
volition
opened
wide
a
sound
as
of
thunder
heard
from
far
away
over
the
sea
beat
upon
giles
ear
as
the
portals
turned
upon
their
hinges
in
answer
to
this
sound
the
clouds
rose
and
lifted
their
golden
heads
and
hastening
to
the
brazen
doors
one
by
one
escaped
through
them
to
the
sunlit
spaces
of
the
morning
sky
there
they
formed
themselves
into
a
fleet
and
sailed
majestically
away
thus
giles
became
the
servant
of
the
shepherd
of
clouds
it
was
his
task
to
unbar
the
door
when
the
shepherd
had
prepared
the
weather
it
was
his
to
lock
the
clouds
in
once
they
had
returned
from
the
heavens
in
answer
to
the
shepherd
summoning
horn
in
time
he
came
to
know
the
from
their
brothers
he
learned
how
frosts
were
sent
forth
how
fogs
were
made
and
he
was
even
allowed
to
prepare
a
small
storm
he
saw
the
icy
caverns
in
which
the
lie
piled
in
monstrous
bags
the
in
their
crystal
jars
and
even
the
prisoned
you
may
be
sure
that
when
he
could
so
arrange
it
phyllida
garden
had
quite
the
finest
variety
of
weather
for
and
would
tell
him
about
her
tell
me
what
is
phyllida
doing
giles
would
say
again
and
again
and
would
answer
she
is
out
in
the
garden
gathering
plums
or
she
is
in
the
kitchen
making
gingerbread
and
then
giles
would
say
to
tell
me
what
is
phyllida
saying
and
would
answer
would
that
my
lad
were
home
two
years
passed
and
giles
who
had
found
no
opportunity
of
escape
began
to
lose
hope
of
doing
so
never
again
he
feared
would
he
see
phyllida
one
day
with
and
by
his
side
he
sat
on
a
great
boulder
and
gazed
gloomily
down
on
the
plain
spring
was
just
ripening
into
early
summer
the
plain
was
at
its
very
greenest
and
loveliest
and
here
and
there
a
little
blue
hung
over
the
tiny
villages
giles
thought
of
phyllida
far
far
away
and
a
terrible
loneliness
poured
into
his
heart
and
sitting
beside
him
their
long
strange
arms
clasped
about
their
knees
looked
on
with
sympathy
presently
right
ear
turned
itself
about
and
after
a
silence
the
elf
said
i
hear
voices
telling
of
war
i
hear
the
robber
king
of
the
black
lakes
summoning
his
terrible
army
he
is
preparing
a
secret
attack
on
the
people
of
the
plain
i
see
him
i
see
him
cried
he
is
talking
to
the
grand
chamberlain
scelerato
listen
said
he
is
saying
will
sweep
the
land
at
dawn
steal
the
grain
and
destroy
every
village
to
its
foundation
i
see
the
robbers
gathering
said
they
are
hiding
in
the
dark
pine
forests
lest
they
be
seen
by
the
people
of
the
plain
the
sunlight
pierces
here
and
there
through
the
thick
branches
and
shines
on
the
breastplates
of
the
armed
men
at
this
terrible
news
giles
was
stricken
to
the
heart
with
anxiety
and
fear
what
was
to
become
of
phyllida
and
the
people
of
the
plain
if
he
could
only
hurry
down
the
mountain
and
warn
them
if
he
could
only
escape
and
he
looked
round
eagerly
as
he
had
looked
a
thousand
times
before
for
any
avenue
of
escape
but
his
gaze
met
only
the
great
precipices
of
the
mountain
and
the
guarded
stairs
what
could
he
do
his
heart
became
like
ice
and
he
feared
to
gaze
upon
the
plain
lest
he
see
the
smoke
of
burning
villages
all
night
long
he
never
closed
his
eyes
at
dawn
he
rose
and
hurried
to
the
top
of
the
gate
which
overlooked
the
for
two
whole
weeks
not
a
cloud
had
been
allowed
to
roam
the
sky
and
it
seemed
to
giles
that
the
mists
were
angry
and
that
a
darkness
brooded
upon
them
turning
toward
the
plain
giles
saw
at
the
edge
of
the
land
a
little
glow
of
fire
the
robbers
had
invaded
the
plain
presently
came
clambering
up
the
steps
i
see
a
village
in
flames
said
the
elf
the
inhabitants
are
fleeing
down
the
roads
the
news
is
spreading
and
the
people
of
the
plain
are
hurrying
to
seek
refuge
in
the
mountains
oh
where
is
phyllida
cried
giles
she
is
on
the
highway
with
jack
and
jill
and
their
children
hastening
toward
the
valley
of
thunder
answered
the
elf
suddenly
giles
stood
up
and
throwing
his
arms
high
over
his
head
uttered
a
loud
shout
i
can
save
them
he
cried
let
us
send
a
storm
against
the
robbers
hurry
let
us
prepare
the
worst
tempest
that
ever
was
seen
and
away
he
ran
to
the
caverns
and
carrying
bag
after
bag
to
the
brim
emptied
them
all
into
the
he
then
tossed
in
a
dozen
skinsful
of
the
fiercest
and
ended
by
casting
in
all
the
jars
of
thunderbolts
that
were
to
be
found
in
the
cavern
you
should
have
heard
the
crash
of
the
crystal
vases
on
the
rocky
floor
of
the
and
the
hiss
with
which
the
lightning
escaped
and
hid
in
the
rolling
edges
of
the
clouds
the
great
bowl
roared
and
trembled
the
clouds
massed
together
and
grew
dark
lightning
played
over
the
black
crests
of
the
from
the
top
of
the
gate
giles
took
one
satisfied
look
into
the
prisoned
tempest
and
then
hurried
down
to
unbar
the
door
through
the
gates
like
wild
herds
poured
the
clouds
and
rising
in
the
air
were
caught
by
the
spreading
and
whirled
madly
over
the
sky
the
thunder
roared
as
no
mortal
had
ever
before
heard
it
or
ever
will
hear
it
again
and
the
tempest
sailed
away
to
break
in
all
its
anger
over
the
heads
of
the
robber
army
so
terrible
was
the
noise
that
the
enchanted
mountain
trembled
to
its
very
foundations
hearing
the
roar
the
shepherd
of
clouds
himself
was
roused
and
ran
down
to
the
cloudbowl
but
so
dark
was
the
that
he
lost
his
way
and
narrowly
missed
falling
down
a
precipice
the
mountain
elves
terrified
by
the
confusion
ran
hither
and
thither
like
ants
whose
nests
had
been
opened
crash
went
the
thunder
rumble
rumble
rumble
room
bang
bang
once
he
had
seen
the
storm
break
over
the
robber
army
giles
taking
advantage
of
the
darkness
noise
and
confusion
determined
to
make
one
more
effort
to
escape
down
the
endless
stairs
he
hurried
splashing
through
the
falling
rain
down
and
down
and
down
once
at
the
bottom
he
was
lucky
enough
to
find
the
path
out
of
the
chasm
and
hurried
along
it
to
the
mouth
of
the
valley
of
thunder
he
was
free
the
terrible
storm
had
spent
itself
and
the
sun
was
beginning
to
shine
on
the
thousand
caught
in
the
matted
grass
a
rainbow
formed
just
as
giles
approached
the
plain
and
the
little
birds
came
out
to
shake
the
rain
from
their
feathers
now
in
the
secure
shelter
of
an
overhanging
cliff
were
to
be
found
those
people
of
the
plain
who
had
fled
to
the
valley
for
refuge
and
when
these
poor
worried
folk
saw
giles
coming
down
the
valley
they
recalled
the
prophecy
that
a
king
should
come
to
them
out
of
the
valley
and
hailed
giles
as
their
king
best
of
all
phyllida
herself
ran
out
and
threw
her
arms
about
her
husband
as
for
the
robbers
the
storm
had
overwhelmed
them
and
swept
them
all
into
the
river
there
i
am
glad
to
say
they
turned
into
little
fishes
when
the
shepherd
of
clouds
found
that
giles
had
escaped
after
making
all
this
disturbance
he
was
very
angry
and
rushed
to
his
lightning
closet
to
hurl
some
thunderbolts
at
him
when
he
got
to
the
closet
however
he
found
that
giles
had
used
every
single
bolt
and
that
the
cupboard
was
empty
consequently
he
had
to
wait
till
the
end
of
summer
before
he
could
get
some
new
lightning
and
by
that
time
he
was
so
busy
arranging
the
autumn
frosts
that
he
quite
forgot
about
giles
so
giles
and
phyllida
became
king
and
queen
of
the
people
of
the
plain
and
lived
happily
ever
after
the
city
under
the
sea
illustration
a
black
ship
in
the
background
persuded
by
another
ship
in
the
foreground
once
upon
a
time
in
a
country
of
mountains
which
bordered
upon
the
sea
dwelt
a
rich
merchant
who
had
three
sons
the
eldest
and
the
were
his
joy
for
they
were
merchants
too
and
remained
at
his
side
but
the
youngest
often
caused
him
much
anxiety
not
that
this
youngest
son
was
a
wild
or
a
bad
lad
but
love
of
the
sea
and
desire
for
adventure
ran
like
fire
in
his
veins
and
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
sit
beside
his
father
and
his
brothers
in
the
weary
at
length
of
the
constant
reproaches
of
his
kinsmen
he
turned
away
one
night
from
his
father
house
and
joined
a
ship
as
a
common
sailor
clad
in
sailor
blue
wearing
a
little
cap
a
blouse
open
at
the
throat
and
trousers
cut
wide
at
the
bottoms
the
runaway
lad
sailed
over
the
sea
to
foreign
lands
and
isles
and
as
the
years
passed
one
by
one
and
brought
no
tidings
of
him
his
father
and
his
brothers
gave
him
up
for
lost
now
the
king
of
the
country
in
which
the
rich
merchant
and
his
son
dwelt
loved
rare
gems
and
precious
stones
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
hidden
secretly
away
in
the
deep
foundations
of
his
castle
lay
his
it
was
circular
in
shape
and
built
of
black
marble
and
at
equal
distance
one
from
the
other
along
the
curving
wall
stood
a
hundred
statues
of
armed
men
holding
lights
a
hundred
coffers
of
green
stone
lay
on
the
floor
one
at
the
base
of
each
statue
each
coffer
piled
high
with
gems
night
after
night
when
all
was
still
the
king
would
descend
to
the
secret
chamber
and
throwing
open
the
covers
of
the
would
gaze
long
and
silently
into
the
gleaming
mass
within
one
night
the
king
led
his
neighbor
the
emperor
of
the
seven
isles
to
the
and
showed
him
his
treasures
are
there
fairer
jewels
to
be
found
in
the
whole
wide
world
said
the
king
proudly
they
are
indeed
noble
replied
the
emperor
nodding
his
gray
head
but
how
happens
it
that
the
emerald
of
the
sea
is
not
among
them
the
emerald
of
the
sea
is
the
most
glorious
jewel
in
the
whole
wide
world
years
ago
a
fisherman
of
the
land
of
the
dawn
found
it
in
a
strangely
carved
box
which
a
storm
had
washed
into
his
nets
i
saw
it
when
i
was
but
a
young
prince
it
hung
by
a
chain
from
the
throat
of
the
princess
of
the
dawn
and
shone
there
as
if
the
very
secret
of
the
sea
were
hidden
in
its
heart
where
is
this
emerald
to
be
found
asked
the
king
who
was
consumed
with
the
desire
to
add
the
jewel
to
his
possessions
tell
me
that
i
may
at
once
send
an
expedition
in
search
of
it
i
have
not
heard
of
it
for
many
a
long
year
replied
the
emperor
but
i
think
it
is
still
in
the
land
of
the
dawn
so
great
was
the
king
impatience
to
become
the
owner
of
the
emerald
of
the
sea
that
he
could
scarcely
wait
for
the
morning
all
night
long
he
slept
not
a
wink
for
thinking
of
it
and
hardly
had
the
red
shield
of
the
morning
sun
risen
above
the
thin
mists
lying
at
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
sky
when
he
sent
for
the
rich
merchant
to
come
to
the
palace
at
once
wondering
much
at
the
summons
the
merchant
made
haste
to
the
palace
and
was
there
taken
instantly
before
the
king
when
the
king
saw
him
he
said
you
are
the
greatest
and
richest
merchant
in
my
dominions
know
then
that
i
have
a
task
worthy
of
you
in
the
land
of
the
dawn
there
is
a
jewel
called
the
emerald
of
the
sea
it
is
your
task
to
discover
it
and
purchase
it
for
me
to
possess
it
i
would
give
all
the
gold
in
my
realm
take
heed
that
you
return
with
it
for
if
you
fail
me
my
anger
shall
strike
you
down
at
these
words
the
merchant
bowed
low
and
replied
that
he
would
that
very
day
sail
for
the
land
of
the
dawn
in
his
fastest
ship
then
returning
home
he
gave
orders
that
the
best
vessel
in
all
his
fleets
be
immediately
prepared
for
the
journey
and
so
swiftly
was
this
done
that
the
merchant
sailed
for
the
land
of
the
dawn
on
the
morning
tide
many
days
and
many
leagues
he
sailed
over
shining
seas
till
he
reached
the
harbor
of
the
land
of
the
dawn
ships
were
entering
and
ships
were
leaving
the
lovely
bay
how
the
broad
sails
tugged
at
their
ropes
as
a
steady
wind
filled
their
curving
white
depths
how
shone
the
furrows
of
foam
flowing
back
from
the
bows
making
her
way
out
toward
the
great
still
mirror
of
the
summer
sea
was
a
strange
black
vessel
with
sails
as
red
as
fire
the
merchant
anchored
his
ship
in
a
quiet
bay
and
hastened
ashore
to
find
the
lord
treasurer
of
the
kingdom
he
found
this
nobleman
at
ease
on
a
balcony
of
his
castle
which
overlooked
the
sea
upon
hearing
the
merchant
story
the
nobleman
started
with
surprise
and
said
you
are
just
too
late
at
the
command
of
my
royal
master
the
prince
of
the
land
of
the
dawn
i
sold
the
emerald
of
the
sea
only
an
hour
ago
to
the
master
of
a
strange
vessel
see
there
she
is
now
and
the
lord
treasurer
pointed
out
over
the
sea
to
the
black
ship
with
the
red
sails
which
was
just
then
disappearing
over
the
horizon
thankful
that
the
other
ship
was
still
in
sight
the
merchant
hurried
back
to
his
own
vessel
and
gave
chase
luckily
for
him
there
was
a
full
moon
that
night
by
which
the
shadowy
hulk
and
the
swaying
masts
of
the
mysterious
ship
could
be
seen
all
the
next
day
they
sailed
but
never
an
inch
nearer
to
the
other
vessel
did
they
come
though
the
merchant
loaded
his
ship
with
all
the
canvas
she
could
bear
another
night
and
another
day
found
them
no
nearer
finally
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
a
great
storm
came
sailing
over
the
edge
of
the
sea
a
blast
of
wind
struck
the
merchant
ship
then
a
torrent
of
rain
and
night
came
on
just
as
the
storm
was
at
its
height
when
the
daylight
came
again
the
other
ship
had
completely
disappeared
and
though
the
worried
merchant
sailed
here
and
sailed
there
never
a
sign
of
the
stranger
could
he
find
at
last
with
a
heavy
heart
he
gave
up
the
quest
and
returned
to
his
king
with
the
evil
tidings
the
king
i
hardly
need
say
was
beside
himself
with
rage
and
disappointment
scowling
so
terribly
that
his
eyebrows
almost
met
he
cried
to
the
merchant
wretch
through
you
i
have
lost
the
finest
jewel
in
the
world
if
you
do
not
find
it
within
a
year
your
life
and
your
possessions
shall
be
forfeited
to
me
on
hearing
these
terrible
words
the
merchant
turned
pale
for
he
had
no
more
idea
where
the
emerald
of
the
sea
was
to
be
found
than
had
a
child
his
two
sons
however
when
they
had
heard
his
story
bade
him
not
to
despair
and
declared
that
they
would
that
very
night
go
forth
and
seek
the
emerald
through
the
world
now
because
the
poor
merchant
could
not
bear
to
be
left
quite
alone
it
was
finally
agreed
that
only
the
eldest
son
should
go
in
search
of
the
jewel
while
the
should
remain
at
home
this
of
course
was
much
against
the
will
of
the
second
son
nevertheless
so
it
was
arranged
and
so
the
eldest
son
sailed
away
the
days
lengthened
into
weeks
the
weeks
into
months
the
months
into
a
year
yet
the
eldest
son
did
not
return
a
guard
of
soldiers
led
the
unhappy
merchant
before
the
king
well
have
you
found
the
emerald
of
the
sea
said
the
king
no
replied
the
merchant
hopelessly
and
now
all
would
certainly
have
been
over
with
the
poor
merchant
had
not
his
second
son
begged
and
pleaded
with
the
king
for
a
year
of
respite
in
which
he
too
might
search
for
the
emerald
through
the
world
though
at
first
unwilling
the
king
at
length
yielded
to
the
plea
but
exacted
one
half
of
the
merchant
possessions
as
a
forfeit
and
so
the
second
son
sailed
away
days
lengthened
into
weeks
weeks
lengthened
into
months
the
months
into
a
year
yet
the
second
son
did
not
return
cruel
storms
wrecked
so
many
of
the
merchant
ships
that
he
lost
the
other
half
of
his
possessions
and
was
forced
to
take
refuge
in
a
miserable
cottage
by
the
marshes
beyond
the
town
on
the
last
night
of
the
year
granted
to
him
by
the
king
the
unhappy
man
sat
in
his
poor
house
by
a
crumbling
driftwood
fire
listening
to
the
surf
breaking
on
the
beach
that
edged
the
marsh
far
away
he
heard
the
bells
of
the
royal
city
sound
the
midnight
hour
neither
the
eldest
son
nor
the
had
returned
the
second
year
of
respite
was
at
an
end
nothing
now
could
stay
the
anger
of
the
king
suddenly
there
came
a
vigorous
on
the
door
i
am
lost
murmured
the
poor
merchant
to
himself
the
king
soldiers
are
already
at
the
door
and
advancing
unsteadily
across
the
room
he
threw
the
door
open
wide
a
gust
of
wind
from
the
sea
blew
in
which
bent
back
the
flame
of
the
taper
in
his
hand
and
then
across
the
threshold
stepped
the
youngest
son
he
was
still
a
sailor
and
clad
in
sailor
blue
and
there
was
a
cutlass
in
his
belt
so
shaken
with
joy
was
the
merchant
that
for
some
time
he
could
not
utter
a
word
but
merely
clung
to
the
strong
shoulders
of
the
young
seaman
as
for
the
sailor
son
he
managed
to
let
his
father
know
that
he
had
returned
from
distant
lands
only
that
very
evening
and
had
just
heard
of
the
disasters
which
had
overtaken
his
family
as
they
talked
steps
were
heard
outside
and
then
without
waiting
to
knock
a
sergeant
of
the
king
guard
forced
open
the
door
and
followed
by
a
handful
of
soldiers
entered
the
wretched
room
and
took
the
merchant
and
his
son
prisoners
they
spent
the
night
on
the
straw
in
the
royal
dungeons
and
in
the
morning
were
led
before
the
king
on
seeing
the
merchant
the
irate
king
scowled
more
angrily
than
ever
for
the
loss
of
the
emerald
of
the
sea
had
never
ceased
from
troubling
him
and
said
well
have
you
found
the
emerald
of
the
sea
no
said
the
poor
merchant
summon
the
executioner
cried
the
king
and
now
the
poor
man
would
certainly
have
bade
farewell
to
earth
had
not
the
youngest
son
like
his
brothers
interceded
with
the
king
at
first
the
king
would
hear
not
a
word
of
it
and
called
to
his
guard
to
take
the
prisoners
instantly
away
but
it
being
whispered
that
the
sailor
although
not
much
more
than
a
lad
had
once
fought
bravely
and
been
sorely
wounded
in
the
royal
service
he
at
length
gave
ear
to
the
youngest
son
prayer
and
said
yes
you
shall
have
another
year
but
know
that
this
year
shall
be
the
last
if
you
do
not
return
with
the
emerald
of
the
sea
within
a
twelvemonth
nothing
shall
save
you
i
have
spoken
and
thus
the
sailor
son
went
in
search
of
the
emerald
what
happened
to
him
upon
his
search
in
what
situation
he
discovered
his
brothers
and
how
he
visited
the
city
under
the
sea
you
shall
shortly
hear
now
the
youngest
son
had
a
little
boat
of
his
own
it
was
so
small
that
when
the
wind
no
longer
filled
its
sails
it
could
be
rowed
along
and
in
this
boat
the
sailor
lad
began
his
voyage
from
harbor
to
harbor
from
nation
to
nation
he
sailed
but
never
a
soul
he
found
who
could
tell
him
aught
of
the
strange
black
ship
with
the
fiery
sails
or
the
lost
emerald
of
the
sea
even
the
people
of
the
land
of
the
dawn
could
tell
him
only
that
the
gem
had
been
sold
to
an
unknown
prince
presently
the
winter
of
the
year
overtook
him
and
in
one
of
the
sudden
storms
that
heralded
the
coming
of
the
cold
his
little
boat
went
ashore
on
a
rocky
coast
and
was
soon
pounded
to
pieces
by
the
breakers
thrown
into
the
sea
during
the
wreck
the
sailor
was
himself
so
tossed
and
trampled
by
the
waves
that
he
reached
the
shore
far
more
dead
than
alive
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
a
poor
fisherman
and
his
wife
there
would
have
been
no
more
story
to
tell
these
good
people
i
am
glad
to
say
rescued
the
sailor
from
the
fury
of
the
waters
and
nursed
him
back
to
health
and
strength
again
when
his
strength
was
quite
restored
the
sailor
told
this
good
couple
the
story
of
how
he
had
gone
forth
to
seek
through
the
wide
world
the
emerald
of
the
sea
but
my
poor
lad
said
the
kind
fisherman
the
emerald
of
the
sea
has
vanished
forever
from
mortal
eyes
what
you
know
of
the
emerald
cried
the
sailor
alas
yes
replied
the
fisherman
two
years
ago
the
prince
of
the
unknown
isles
sent
the
finest
vessel
in
his
fleet
to
the
land
of
the
dawn
to
buy
the
jewel
a
beautiful
ship
was
she
with
a
hull
as
black
as
night
and
sails
as
red
as
fire
my
brother
and
i
sailed
in
her
crew
the
jewel
was
taken
aboard
our
brave
ship
set
sail
for
the
unknown
isles
hardly
were
we
three
days
out
of
the
sight
of
land
when
a
storm
overtook
us
and
sank
the
vessel
i
chanced
to
be
tossed
in
the
water
near
a
great
fragment
of
the
mast
and
clung
to
this
until
a
passing
vessel
found
me
of
all
aboard
i
alone
survived
forty
fathoms
deep
lies
the
emerald
of
the
sea
never
more
to
be
seen
but
by
the
dumb
creatures
of
the
waters
at
these
tidings
the
brave
sailor
heart
became
like
ice
nevertheless
he
cried
alas
good
friend
i
know
that
what
you
say
is
true
yet
shall
i
not
despair
for
come
what
will
i
must
save
my
father
hearing
this
the
fisherman
wife
a
quiet
good
body
who
had
had
little
to
say
whispered
that
it
would
be
well
first
to
consult
the
witch
of
the
sands
the
witch
of
the
sands
who
is
she
and
where
can
i
find
her
cried
the
sailor
the
witch
of
the
sands
dwells
a
hundred
leagues
from
here
replied
the
fisherman
wife
all
the
mysteries
of
the
waters
are
in
her
keeping
and
she
has
an
answer
for
them
all
you
must
go
to
her
and
ask
her
to
help
you
so
the
sailor
thanked
the
good
fisherman
and
his
wife
and
set
out
to
walk
the
hundred
leagues
to
the
house
of
the
witch
of
the
sands
his
path
lay
along
a
desolate
and
lonely
shore
on
whose
rocky
beaches
the
wooden
bones
of
old
wrecks
lay
rotting
half
buried
in
stones
and
weed
just
as
the
third
day
sun
was
sinking
in
the
shining
waters
the
sailor
arrived
at
the
witch
dwelling
the
witch
made
her
home
in
a
deserted
old
ship
which
a
storm
of
long
ago
had
cast
far
up
the
sands
as
for
the
witch
herself
she
was
a
woman
so
old
that
the
sailor
thought
she
surely
must
have
been
living
when
the
moon
and
the
stars
were
made
a
fringe
of
circled
the
crown
of
her
high
hat
and
round
her
wrists
were
bracelets
of
pearly
periwinkles
just
as
the
sailor
approached
the
witch
door
a
young
fur
seal
who
had
been
basking
in
a
little
pool
left
along
the
beach
by
the
tide
hastened
out
of
his
puddle
and
running
swiftly
toward
him
on
his
flappers
nuzzled
his
hand
with
his
sleek
wet
head
just
like
a
young
dog
down
neptune
down
cried
the
witch
shrilly
good
evening
madam
said
the
sailor
in
his
politest
manner
you
are
the
third
person
who
has
come
here
to
ask
me
the
question
you
are
going
to
ask
screamed
the
witch
of
the
sands
whose
magic
powers
had
revealed
to
her
the
reason
of
the
sailor
coming
i
know
you
you
are
the
youngest
son
your
two
brothers
have
been
here
to
ask
me
the
way
under
the
sea
and
i
told
them
but
bless
me
they
have
come
back
yet
just
like
young
men
to
forget
an
old
woman
warning
i
a
good
mind
not
to
tell
you
the
way
to
the
indeed
i
would
if
you
were
a
sailor
and
a
child
of
the
sea
yes
i
can
show
you
the
road
to
under
the
sea
but
you
must
not
ask
me
about
the
emerald
because
i
do
know
where
it
is
myself
it
was
in
the
land
of
the
dawn
and
that
the
last
i
heard
of
it
when
you
do
get
to
the
do
forget
that
you
have
to
hurry
back
like
the
wind
for
the
year
which
the
king
gave
your
father
is
almost
gone
do
ask
me
questions
i
know
you
are
going
to
ask
one
because
i
not
a
man
and
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
ask
because
i
a
witch
and
the
strange
old
lady
laughed
and
putting
her
hands
on
her
waist
swayed
so
violently
from
side
to
side
that
the
on
her
hat
rattled
and
clicked
then
after
a
pause
to
gather
breath
she
continued
before
you
can
go
down
into
the
waters
i
shall
have
to
give
you
an
enchanted
ring
mind
you
bring
it
back
for
there
are
only
three
of
them
in
the
whole
wide
world
and
your
brothers
have
the
other
two
goodness
me
but
i
do
know
why
i
let
them
take
my
magic
rings
now
that
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
know
as
i
shall
let
you
take
my
ring
however
it
has
been
on
my
mind
for
some
time
to
tell
the
king
of
the
city
under
the
sea
that
he
been
telling
the
tide
to
come
altogether
too
near
my
ship
you
can
take
the
ring
if
you
will
promise
to
deliver
my
message
promise
there
was
a
pause
and
the
sailor
who
had
listened
to
the
witch
every
word
solemnly
promised
to
carry
her
message
to
the
king
under
the
sea
he
was
just
about
to
ask
a
question
or
two
when
the
witch
of
the
sands
drawing
another
long
long
breath
cried
out
again
do
ask
questions
i
told
you
once
and
i
told
you
twice
and
i
tell
you
as
many
times
as
there
are
drops
of
water
in
the
sea
the
path
to
the
city
under
the
sea
begins
a
hundred
leagues
to
the
north
in
the
high
cliffs
there
when
the
tide
is
low
you
find
the
mouth
of
a
great
cave
walk
down
this
cave
and
down
and
down
and
down
till
you
feel
water
rising
round
your
feet
then
put
on
my
ring
and
walk
boldly
ahead
in
a
little
while
you
will
see
the
city
shining
in
the
waters
once
there
seek
out
the
king
and
tell
him
of
your
quest
but
on
no
account
and
here
the
witch
solemnly
turned
round
three
times
eat
or
drink
anything
offered
to
you
while
you
are
in
the
if
you
do
you
will
forget
everything
of
your
past
life
your
father
your
quest
and
the
emerald
of
the
sea
let
one
drop
pass
your
lips
and
you
will
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
under
the
waves
here
is
the
enchanted
ring
put
it
in
your
pocket
with
these
words
the
witch
took
from
a
little
leather
purse
a
simple
golden
ring
and
handed
it
to
the
youngest
son
who
put
the
ring
in
his
pocket
thanked
the
witch
and
set
off
for
the
cavern
which
led
to
the
city
under
the
sea
you
may
be
sure
it
did
not
take
him
very
long
to
find
it
after
feeling
carefully
in
his
pocket
to
see
if
the
ring
was
still
safe
the
sailor
plunged
on
into
the
winding
cave
in
a
short
time
the
roar
of
the
breakers
on
the
beach
which
had
been
loud
at
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
began
to
fade
and
grow
faint
and
the
tunnel
grew
dark
and
cold
feeling
for
the
wall
of
the
passage
with
one
hand
the
youngest
son
advanced
into
the
blackness
creatures
of
the
sea
with
round
shining
eyes
stared
at
him
from
shallow
pools
and
now
and
then
his
hand
running
along
the
wall
would
touch
and
shake
from
its
place
a
starfish
or
great
snail
down
and
down
and
down
went
the
sailor
presently
he
heard
the
lapping
of
wavelets
in
the
darkness
and
a
few
minutes
after
he
felt
himself
advancing
into
deepening
water
stopping
for
an
instant
he
put
on
the
golden
ring
then
walking
on
again
he
felt
the
water
rise
from
his
ankles
to
his
waist
and
from
his
waist
to
his
throat
one
step
more
and
the
water
closed
over
his
head
once
under
the
waves
the
sailor
hesitated
uncertain
as
to
which
way
to
turn
little
by
little
however
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
touch
of
the
water
and
he
saw
lying
on
the
bottom
a
few
feet
ahead
of
him
a
small
ball
glowing
with
a
pale
phosphorescent
light
stooping
to
touch
this
strange
object
the
sailor
discovered
it
to
be
a
small
round
which
had
anchored
itself
to
a
stone
and
presently
he
discovered
that
this
light
was
but
one
of
thousands
which
together
formed
a
long
straight
line
across
the
level
floor
of
the
sea
rightly
imagining
these
lights
to
be
signs
of
a
road
the
sailor
advanced
along
them
a
slow
walk
of
ten
long
leagues
brought
him
to
the
gate
of
the
city
under
the
sea
there
was
very
little
light
there
save
for
that
which
came
through
the
waters
from
the
world
above
and
this
was
but
a
faint
pale
green
glow
which
lay
more
like
a
shadow
than
a
light
on
the
roofs
and
of
the
submerged
town
the
sailor
walked
unchallenged
through
the
gate
and
found
himself
in
the
great
street
of
the
city
along
the
broad
avenue
grew
giant
with
brown
leaves
set
out
in
rows
like
trees
and
through
the
foliage
which
moved
heavily
in
the
currents
little
fish
darted
like
birds
many
people
walked
slowly
to
and
fro
strange
people
of
the
sea
all
dressed
alike
in
garments
of
shining
scales
the
sailor
looked
into
their
faces
and
saw
that
a
broad
golden
ring
encircled
the
pupils
of
their
eyes
suddenly
two
men
of
the
sea
distinguished
from
the
others
by
swords
of
red
stone
moved
through
the
water
and
seizing
the
sailor
in
their
webbed
hands
hurried
him
before
the
king
of
the
on
a
coral
throne
in
a
great
hall
roofed
with
a
high
circular
dome
sat
the
king
the
flowing
waters
within
were
bright
and
a
queer
pale
green
light
pierced
through
the
hall
from
a
kind
of
fountain
of
light
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
under
the
dome
approaching
this
shining
fountain
the
sailor
discovered
it
to
be
a
mass
of
glowing
living
flowers
of
the
deep
which
even
as
he
looked
stirred
their
mysterious
petals
welcome
wearer
of
the
enchanted
ring
said
the
king
staring
hard
at
the
sailor
with
his
large
golden
eyes
you
come
at
a
fortunate
time
this
very
evening
we
celebrate
the
wedding
of
the
second
of
my
three
daughters
with
the
mortal
wearer
of
the
second
ring
stand
you
upon
the
steps
of
the
throne
for
they
are
coming
at
once
let
the
trumpets
sound
at
this
command
two
youths
of
the
sea
lifted
huge
to
their
mouths
and
sounded
them
great
doors
instantly
opened
wide
and
a
gorgeous
procession
entered
first
appeared
a
dozen
pages
then
in
walked
the
sea
king
second
daughter
hand
in
hand
with
a
merry
young
man
in
whom
the
sailor
recognized
his
second
oldest
brother
presently
the
sounded
again
the
prince
and
the
princess
cried
a
voice
the
king
leaned
over
from
his
throne
and
whispered
in
the
ear
my
eldest
daughter
and
her
husband
they
were
married
just
a
year
ago
the
prince
is
a
youth
of
the
world
above
and
wears
the
first
of
the
enchanted
rings
now
entered
the
eldest
princess
of
the
sea
walking
by
the
side
of
her
husband
and
in
the
husband
the
young
sailor
beheld
the
elder
of
his
two
brothers
and
though
the
young
sailor
stretched
out
his
arms
to
them
neither
of
his
brothers
remembered
him
for
while
faint
and
hungry
they
had
forgotten
the
warning
of
the
witch
of
the
sands
and
had
eaten
of
the
bread
of
the
thus
had
the
memory
of
the
world
above
the
lost
emerald
and
their
father
plight
faded
away
the
conches
sounded
a
third
time
come
to
the
wedding
banquet
cried
the
king
you
shall
sit
beside
my
youngest
daughter
and
now
the
sailor
lad
willy
nilly
was
hurried
into
the
banquet
hall
and
seated
at
the
royal
table
beside
the
king
youngest
daughter
and
she
was
quite
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
three
noticing
that
the
youngest
son
touched
no
food
she
said
to
him
why
do
you
refuse
to
taste
of
the
wedding
banquet
princess
replied
the
sailor
i
have
come
to
the
to
seek
the
emerald
of
the
sea
for
if
i
return
to
my
own
country
without
it
my
father
life
will
be
forfeited
would
you
have
me
forget
but
you
will
never
find
the
emerald
of
the
sea
cried
the
princess
never
find
the
emerald
of
the
sea
what
do
you
mean
said
the
sailor
anxiously
the
emerald
of
the
sea
has
disappeared
continued
the
little
princess
fixing
the
sailor
with
her
golden
eyes
years
ago
it
was
stolen
from
my
father
treasury
by
a
wicked
prince
of
the
my
father
pursued
him
and
overthrew
him
but
in
the
struggle
the
emerald
was
lost
and
rising
to
the
surface
drifted
to
the
shores
of
the
land
of
the
dawn
there
it
remained
till
the
prince
of
the
unknown
isles
purchased
it
and
took
it
away
in
his
black
ship
this
ship
overcome
by
a
storm
sank
but
where
it
lies
we
know
not
though
we
have
searched
far
and
wide
through
the
waters
whosoever
finds
it
shall
be
master
of
the
land
under
the
sea
for
the
emerald
is
master
of
us
all
my
father
will
not
lift
a
finger
to
help
you
find
it
indeed
if
he
knows
that
you
are
in
search
of
it
he
will
force
you
to
eat
of
the
bread
of
the
say
nothing
therefore
of
your
quest
at
these
words
the
brave
sailor
heart
sank
very
low
mindful
of
the
witch
warning
he
dared
touch
no
morsel
of
food
yet
he
knew
that
hunger
would
soon
bring
weakness
in
its
train
either
he
must
find
the
emerald
at
once
or
he
must
abandon
all
hope
of
finding
it
he
could
not
live
long
if
he
touched
no
food
and
if
but
one
morsel
touched
his
lips
he
would
forget
the
upper
world
far
away
the
poor
merchant
whom
the
king
had
now
cast
in
prison
watched
the
days
pass
one
by
one
and
the
last
year
approach
its
end
every
morning
he
would
ask
for
tidings
of
his
sailor
son
and
ask
in
vain
now
when
the
wedding
banquet
was
over
and
the
ball
which
followed
was
at
its
height
the
eldest
of
the
princesses
called
her
sister
the
bride
aside
and
said
to
her
we
must
rid
ourselves
at
once
of
this
newcomer
do
you
not
see
that
he
is
the
younger
brother
of
our
husbands
i
beheld
him
stretch
out
his
arms
to
them
as
they
passed
who
can
tell
but
that
he
may
lead
them
away
from
us
let
us
tell
our
servants
to
lie
in
wait
for
him
and
deliver
us
from
such
a
danger
so
said
the
eldest
sister
of
the
golden
eyes
alas
i
fear
that
the
people
of
the
are
sometimes
quite
as
shocking
as
those
of
the
world
above
later
that
evening
just
as
the
poor
sailor
was
standing
by
one
of
the
great
doors
a
dozen
or
so
stout
rogues
in
the
service
of
the
eldest
sister
fell
upon
him
bound
him
with
cords
and
dragged
him
through
the
water
to
the
royal
stables
now
the
people
of
the
having
no
horses
for
sea
horses
are
but
tiny
creatures
had
tamed
great
dolphins
to
carry
them
about
a
hundred
of
these
monsters
each
with
a
bronze
ring
in
his
nose
were
ranged
along
the
sides
of
the
stables
and
on
the
fiercest
and
angriest
of
them
all
the
princess
servants
tied
the
sailor
how
the
great
fish
fastened
to
a
bar
by
a
chain
and
his
pulled
rolled
swerved
aside
and
thrashed
his
tail
but
all
his
twistings
were
of
no
avail
for
the
poor
sailor
lad
was
soon
fastened
to
his
back
with
a
rope
of
seaweed
then
the
creature
was
released
from
his
chain
given
a
blow
on
the
side
with
a
whip
of
and
turned
into
the
wilds
of
the
for
half
an
hour
the
fish
frightened
at
his
burden
fled
at
lightning
speed
over
the
roofs
of
the
city
and
sped
on
into
the
lonely
plain
then
ceasing
his
mad
flight
he
tried
again
to
shake
himself
free
of
the
sailor
he
turned
he
leaped
he
dived
but
all
in
vain
for
the
sailor
was
securely
fastened
to
his
back
terrified
anew
with
a
swift
motion
of
his
great
fins
he
shot
violently
to
one
side
and
rushed
on
and
on
into
the
dark
all
that
long
night
he
fled
toward
the
morning
of
the
next
day
however
the
sailor
managed
to
work
one
arm
free
and
draw
the
cutlass
from
his
waist
with
this
he
made
short
work
of
his
bonds
and
rolled
off
the
fish
back
the
great
animal
delivered
of
the
weight
which
had
lain
upon
it
rose
on
the
tip
of
its
tail
and
shot
madly
toward
the
surface
and
the
sailor
tumbled
through
the
waters
to
the
bottom
weak
and
hungry
the
poor
young
seaman
gazed
about
in
the
and
found
himself
on
the
lower
slopes
of
a
sunken
mountain
rising
from
the
ocean
floor
in
no
direction
could
he
find
a
sign
of
the
city
under
the
sea
hoping
however
to
see
better
from
the
mountain
top
he
decided
to
climb
it
strange
plants
and
shells
lay
in
the
crevices
of
the
weedy
rocks
schools
of
bright
fish
fled
past
him
like
living
arrows
and
huge
crabs
scuttled
away
as
he
appeared
suddenly
lying
on
her
side
in
a
little
ravine
of
the
mountain
he
saw
a
ship
the
black
ship
of
the
emerald
of
the
sea
weary
and
weak
though
he
was
it
took
the
sailor
but
a
moment
to
clamber
aboard
and
hurry
past
the
broken
masts
into
the
captain
cabin
a
steady
green
radiance
shone
in
one
corner
of
the
weedy
room
and
hastening
toward
it
the
sailor
found
at
last
the
emerald
of
the
sea
the
box
which
had
enclosed
it
had
rotted
away
and
fallen
apart
victory
cried
the
sailor
victory
the
emerald
is
mine
at
last
and
i
shall
save
my
father
he
took
the
great
jewel
from
the
broken
box
and
rested
it
in
the
cup
of
his
two
hands
how
it
glowed
on
the
pale
flesh
then
thrusting
it
into
a
pocket
and
holding
onto
it
with
one
hand
he
hurried
out
again
to
the
mountainside
in
the
world
above
it
was
high
noon
and
the
level
rays
of
the
sun
beat
deep
into
the
green
waters
so
bright
had
the
slope
become
that
the
sailor
lad
felt
sure
that
he
could
not
be
far
from
the
surface
of
the
waves
moreover
if
the
rose
above
the
waters
it
would
form
an
island
in
the
upper
world
and
so
indeed
it
was
climbing
on
toward
the
top
of
the
mountain
the
sailor
first
scaled
a
steep
cliff
and
at
the
top
of
this
he
found
a
gentle
slope
of
sand
the
sun
rays
now
illumined
the
water
so
brightly
that
the
air
seemed
only
a
little
distance
away
presently
a
ran
nimbly
away
from
beneath
the
sailor
feet
the
water
grew
very
much
warmer
the
shore
was
at
hand
a
few
steps
more
and
the
youngest
son
emerged
on
the
beach
of
a
beautiful
isle
by
the
sun
he
walked
toward
the
dry
land
there
he
found
some
delicious
fruits
growing
and
a
rippling
brook
of
crystal
water
he
ate
and
drank
and
his
strength
returned
himself
again
the
sailor
took
the
emerald
of
the
sea
in
his
hands
and
cried
by
the
power
of
the
emerald
of
the
sea
i
summon
here
the
two
elder
princesses
of
the
and
my
two
brothers
their
husbands
there
was
a
sound
of
far
thunder
under
the
clear
blue
sky
and
a
moment
later
four
heads
rose
out
of
the
waters
and
shaking
the
salt
spray
from
their
eyes
the
princesses
and
the
brothers
walked
through
the
shallows
to
where
the
sailor
was
standing
now
the
princesses
were
very
much
frightened
when
they
beheld
the
sailor
holding
the
emerald
and
falling
on
their
knees
before
him
begged
him
to
forgive
their
misdeeds
and
not
to
take
away
their
loved
ones
tears
fell
from
their
golden
eyes
and
mingled
with
the
drops
of
the
salt
ocean
still
coursing
down
their
black
scales
as
for
the
brothers
they
would
have
hurled
themselves
upon
the
sailor
had
not
the
magic
force
of
the
emerald
prevented
their
approach
be
merciful
and
forgive
said
the
younger
of
the
sisters
after
all
had
we
not
caused
you
to
be
spirited
away
you
never
would
have
found
the
emerald
yes
that
is
true
said
the
sailor
my
brothers
shall
decide
for
themselves
break
then
the
spell
which
binds
them
to
the
restore
to
them
their
memory
of
the
past
and
if
then
they
choose
to
remain
i
shall
not
try
to
lead
them
away
reverse
the
spell
that
is
easily
done
said
the
elder
sister
let
them
but
touch
the
food
or
drink
of
the
upper
world
and
their
memory
will
return
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
the
sisters
offered
the
enchanted
brothers
water
from
the
rivulet
when
they
had
drunk
of
it
both
the
brothers
became
pale
as
death
their
eyes
opened
wide
and
they
stared
as
strangely
as
men
suddenly
waked
from
sleep
then
seeing
their
younger
brother
they
ran
to
him
and
threw
their
arms
about
him
and
asked
a
thousand
questions
about
their
father
and
the
quest
of
the
emerald
the
brides
watched
them
with
sad
faces
and
finally
broke
into
quiet
tears
imagine
their
joy
when
their
husbands
returned
to
them
and
bade
them
be
of
good
cheer
thus
was
true
love
found
to
be
mightier
than
the
mightiest
spell
now
when
the
princesses
of
the
sea
had
dried
their
tears
the
sailor
and
his
brothers
took
counsel
as
to
how
the
emerald
of
the
sea
might
be
brought
to
the
king
in
time
to
save
their
father
life
you
may
judge
of
the
sailor
horror
when
he
discovered
that
because
of
a
bad
error
in
the
calendars
and
clocks
of
sixes
and
sevens
a
city
he
had
visited
in
his
search
for
the
emerald
the
life
of
his
father
had
been
forfeited
to
the
king
three
days
before
but
now
we
must
return
to
the
poor
merchant
himself
all
the
third
year
the
poor
man
had
lain
in
a
small
cell
in
the
royal
dungeons
waiting
anxiously
oh
so
anxiously
to
hear
the
quick
step
of
the
sailor
son
on
the
winding
stairs
just
outside
his
prison
door
but
the
year
came
to
an
end
as
you
know
without
his
return
for
the
third
and
last
time
the
castle
guards
led
the
poor
man
before
the
king
now
the
king
had
never
forgiven
the
merchant
for
the
loss
of
the
jewel
his
chagrin
indeed
had
increased
with
the
years
and
he
was
very
glad
that
he
could
at
last
take
his
revenge
have
you
found
the
emerald
of
the
sea
said
the
king
harshly
he
stood
erect
on
the
steps
of
his
arms
folded
eyes
fixed
in
a
fierce
black
frown
no
said
the
merchant
quietly
then
you
shall
seek
for
it
yourself
cried
the
king
and
he
gave
orders
that
the
merchant
be
tied
hand
and
foot
and
tossed
into
a
little
boat
without
food
or
drink
and
then
sent
adrift
to
die
helplessly
in
the
lonely
seas
and
so
this
awful
sentence
was
carried
out
bound
hand
and
foot
scarce
able
to
roll
from
side
to
side
the
merchant
lay
motionless
in
his
little
craft
and
stared
up
at
the
blue
sky
presently
a
merciful
sleep
overcame
him
and
while
he
slept
a
wind
arose
which
swept
the
little
boat
along
with
it
meanwhile
on
the
beautiful
island
the
sailor
and
his
companions
stunned
at
their
discovery
began
preparations
to
return
to
the
just
as
the
twilight
fell
all
walked
together
to
the
margin
of
the
darkening
sea
and
advanced
into
the
waves
suddenly
the
sailor
whose
eyes
were
the
keenest
saw
a
little
boat
rapidly
drifting
ashore
now
caught
in
a
current
of
the
shallow
beach
it
drifted
sideways
now
propelled
by
the
rising
tide
it
floated
on
bow
pointed
to
the
shore
the
sailor
hurried
toward
it
and
seized
it
suddenly
he
uttered
a
ringing
cry
the
old
merchant
lay
on
the
floor
of
the
boat
he
still
lived
for
they
could
see
him
gently
breathing
lifting
him
up
tenderly
the
three
sons
carried
him
to
the
shore
unloosed
his
bonds
and
brought
him
back
to
life
now
when
the
merchant
was
himself
again
the
sailor
through
the
power
of
the
emerald
caused
the
waves
to
carry
a
great
ship
to
the
island
and
on
this
ship
the
three
sons
the
two
princesses
and
the
old
merchant
returned
to
the
merchant
country
all
landed
secretly
however
for
they
knew
that
the
angry
king
would
seize
them
if
he
knew
of
their
return
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
one
night
shortly
after
the
homecoming
word
was
brought
to
the
sailor
that
the
king
had
heard
of
the
merchant
escape
and
was
sending
guards
to
arrest
the
merchant
and
his
companions
it
was
almost
midnight
when
the
sailor
lad
received
the
warning
taking
the
emerald
with
him
he
advanced
to
a
window
by
the
ocean
and
cried
out
over
the
moonlit
waters
waters
of
the
sea
rise
and
overwhelm
the
palace
of
the
king
now
the
king
palace
stood
apart
by
itself
on
a
tongue
of
land
running
far
out
into
the
tide
and
soon
the
rising
waters
were
flowing
over
the
marble
floors
and
pouring
in
through
the
windows
one
by
one
the
lights
in
the
thousand
rooms
touched
by
the
waves
hissed
sputtered
and
expired
the
servants
of
the
palace
one
and
all
ran
away
and
left
the
dark
castle
to
its
fate
little
by
little
the
advancing
water
crept
from
the
walls
to
the
balconies
from
the
balconies
to
the
towers
and
from
the
foot
of
the
towers
to
their
very
tops
finally
all
the
moon
could
see
as
it
shone
upon
the
flood
was
the
of
the
highest
turret
of
all
you
should
have
seen
the
little
waves
ripple
and
break
about
it
and
finally
even
the
disappeared
under
the
black
waves
locked
in
his
secret
opening
the
jewel
coffers
one
after
the
other
the
king
remained
quite
ignorant
of
the
disaster
for
some
time
no
sound
reached
him
in
his
hidden
retreat
because
the
door
of
the
was
very
thick
and
strong
suddenly
he
heard
behind
him
the
sound
of
falling
water
and
turning
toward
the
door
beheld
streams
of
water
gushing
through
the
passages
between
the
door
and
its
frame
he
watched
the
door
burst
from
its
locks
and
hinges
a
roaring
cascade
of
cold
came
pouring
in
the
room
and
a
moment
later
the
whole
castle
crumbled
and
fell
to
pieces
now
when
the
king
had
met
his
deserts
the
people
of
the
country
who
greatly
respected
the
merchant
offered
him
the
crown
but
he
refused
it
and
conferred
it
on
his
two
elder
sons
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
country
had
two
kings
each
brother
in
turn
reigned
for
six
months
of
every
year
and
spent
the
other
six
under
the
sea
with
the
people
of
the
waters
as
for
the
sailor
lad
he
sailed
the
sea
for
many
years
and
finally
married
a
pretty
niece
of
the
witch
of
the
sands
then
like
all
sailors
he
went
to
the
country
to
live
his
house
is
built
of
gray
stone
ivy
climbs
over
it
and
apple
orchards
lie
beneath
its
windows
and
the
all
lived
happily
ever
after
