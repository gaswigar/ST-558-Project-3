chapter
i
little
dot
had
lost
her
way
in
the
bush
she
knew
it
and
was
very
frightened
she
was
too
frightened
in
fact
to
cry
but
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
little
dry
bare
space
looking
around
her
at
the
scraggy
growths
of
prickly
shrubs
that
had
torn
her
little
dress
to
rags
scratched
her
bare
legs
and
feet
till
they
bled
and
pricked
her
hands
and
arms
as
she
had
pushed
madly
through
the
bushes
for
hours
seeking
her
home
sometimes
she
looked
up
to
the
sky
but
little
of
it
could
be
seen
because
of
the
great
tall
trees
that
seemed
to
her
to
be
trying
to
reach
heaven
with
their
crooked
branches
she
could
see
little
patches
of
blue
sky
between
the
tangled
tufts
of
drooping
leaves
and
as
the
dazzling
sunlight
had
faded
she
began
to
think
it
was
getting
late
and
that
very
soon
it
would
be
night
the
thought
of
being
lost
and
alone
in
the
wild
bush
at
night
took
her
breath
away
with
fear
and
made
her
tired
little
legs
tremble
under
her
she
gave
up
all
hope
of
finding
her
home
and
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
the
biggest
blackbutt
tree
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
and
knees
and
thought
of
all
that
had
happened
and
what
might
happen
yet
it
seemed
such
a
long
long
time
since
her
mother
had
told
her
that
she
might
gather
some
bush
flowers
whilst
she
cooked
the
dinner
and
dot
recollected
how
she
was
bid
not
to
go
out
of
sight
of
the
cottage
how
she
wished
now
that
she
had
remembered
this
sooner
but
whilst
she
was
picking
the
pretty
flowers
a
hare
suddenly
started
at
her
feet
and
sprang
away
into
the
bush
and
she
had
run
after
it
when
she
found
that
she
could
not
catch
the
hare
she
discovered
that
she
could
no
longer
see
the
cottage
after
wandering
for
a
while
she
got
frightened
and
ran
and
ran
little
knowing
that
she
was
going
further
away
from
her
home
at
every
step
where
she
was
sitting
under
the
blackbutt
tree
she
was
miles
away
from
her
father
selection
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
anyone
to
find
her
she
felt
that
she
was
a
long
way
off
and
she
began
to
think
of
what
was
happening
at
home
she
remembered
how
not
very
long
ago
a
neighbour
little
boy
had
been
lost
and
how
his
mother
had
come
to
their
cottage
for
help
to
find
him
and
that
her
father
had
ridden
off
on
the
big
bay
horse
to
bring
men
from
all
the
selections
around
to
help
in
the
search
she
remembered
their
coming
back
in
the
darkness
numbers
of
strange
men
she
had
never
seen
before
old
men
young
men
and
boys
all
on
their
horses
and
how
they
came
indoors
and
what
a
noise
they
made
all
talking
together
in
their
big
deep
voices
they
looked
terrible
men
so
tall
and
brown
and
fierce
with
their
rough
bristly
beards
and
they
all
spoke
in
such
funny
tones
to
her
as
if
they
were
trying
to
make
their
voices
small
during
many
days
these
men
came
and
went
and
every
time
they
were
more
sad
and
less
noisy
the
little
boy
mother
used
to
come
and
stay
crying
whilst
the
men
were
searching
the
bush
for
her
little
son
then
one
evening
dot
father
came
home
alone
and
both
her
mother
and
the
little
boy
mother
went
away
in
a
great
hurry
then
very
late
her
mother
came
back
crying
and
her
father
sat
smoking
by
the
fire
looking
very
sad
and
she
never
saw
that
little
boy
again
although
he
had
been
found
she
wondered
now
if
all
these
rough
big
men
were
riding
into
the
bush
to
find
her
and
if
after
many
days
they
would
find
her
and
no
one
ever
see
her
again
she
seemed
to
see
her
mother
crying
and
her
father
very
sad
and
all
the
men
very
solemn
these
thoughts
made
her
so
miserable
that
she
began
to
cry
herself
dot
does
not
know
how
long
she
was
sobbing
in
loneliness
and
fear
with
her
head
on
her
knees
and
with
her
little
hands
covering
her
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
cruel
wild
bush
in
which
she
was
lost
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
she
summoned
up
courage
to
uncover
her
weeping
eyes
and
look
once
more
at
the
bare
dry
earth
and
the
wilderness
of
scrub
and
trees
that
seemed
to
close
her
in
as
if
she
were
in
a
prison
when
she
did
look
up
she
was
surprised
to
see
that
she
was
no
longer
alone
she
forgot
all
her
trouble
and
fear
in
her
astonishment
at
seeing
a
big
grey
kangaroo
squatting
quite
close
to
her
in
front
of
her
illustration
the
kangaroo
finds
dot
what
was
most
surprising
was
that
the
kangaroo
evidently
understood
that
dot
was
in
trouble
and
was
sorry
for
her
for
down
the
animal
nice
soft
grey
muzzle
two
tiny
little
tears
were
slowly
trickling
when
dot
looked
up
at
it
with
wonder
in
her
round
blue
eyes
the
kangaroo
did
not
jump
away
but
remained
gazing
sympathetically
at
dot
with
a
slightly
puzzled
air
suddenly
the
big
animal
seemed
to
have
an
idea
and
it
lightly
hopped
off
into
the
scrub
where
dot
could
just
see
it
bobbing
up
and
down
as
if
it
were
hunting
for
something
presently
back
came
the
strange
kangaroo
with
a
spray
of
berries
in
her
funny
black
hands
they
were
pretty
berries
some
were
green
some
were
red
some
blue
and
others
white
dot
was
quite
glad
to
take
them
when
the
kangaroo
offered
them
to
her
and
as
this
friendly
animal
seemed
to
wish
her
to
eat
them
she
did
so
gladly
because
she
was
beginning
to
feel
hungry
after
she
had
eaten
a
few
berries
a
very
strange
thing
happened
while
dot
had
been
alone
in
the
bush
it
had
all
seemed
so
dreadfully
still
there
had
been
no
sound
but
the
gentle
stir
of
a
light
fitful
breeze
in
the
all
around
had
been
so
quiet
that
her
loneliness
had
seemed
twenty
times
more
lonely
now
however
under
the
influence
of
these
small
sweet
berries
dot
was
surprised
to
hear
voices
everywhere
at
first
it
seemed
like
hearing
sounds
in
a
dream
they
were
so
faint
and
distant
but
soon
the
talking
grew
nearer
and
nearer
louder
and
clearer
until
the
whole
bush
seemed
filled
with
talking
they
were
all
little
voices
some
indeed
quite
tiny
whispers
and
squeaks
but
they
were
very
numerous
and
seemed
to
be
everywhere
they
came
from
the
earth
from
the
bushes
from
the
trees
and
from
the
very
air
the
little
girl
looked
round
to
see
where
they
came
from
but
everything
looked
just
the
same
hundreds
of
ants
of
all
kinds
and
sizes
were
hurrying
to
their
nests
a
few
lizards
were
scuttling
about
amongst
the
dry
twigs
and
sparse
grasses
there
were
some
grasshoppers
and
in
the
trees
birds
fluttered
to
and
fro
then
dot
knew
that
she
was
hearing
and
understanding
everything
that
was
being
said
by
all
the
insects
and
creatures
in
the
bush
all
this
time
the
kangaroo
had
been
speaking
only
dot
had
been
too
surprised
to
listen
but
now
the
gentle
soft
voice
of
the
kind
animal
caught
her
attention
and
she
found
that
the
kangaroo
was
in
the
middle
of
a
speech
i
understood
what
was
the
matter
with
you
at
once
she
was
saying
for
i
feel
just
the
same
myself
i
have
been
miserable
like
you
ever
since
i
lost
my
baby
kangaroo
you
also
must
have
lost
something
tell
me
what
it
is
i
lost
my
way
said
dot
rather
wondering
if
the
kangaroo
would
understand
her
ah
said
the
kangaroo
quite
delighted
at
her
own
cleverness
i
knew
you
had
lost
something
is
it
a
dreadful
feeling
you
feel
as
if
you
had
no
inside
do
you
and
you
not
inclined
to
eat
anything
not
even
the
youngest
grass
i
have
been
like
that
ever
since
i
lost
my
baby
kangaroo
now
tell
me
said
the
creature
confidentially
what
your
way
is
like
i
may
be
able
to
find
it
for
you
dot
found
that
she
must
explain
what
she
meant
by
saying
she
had
lost
her
way
and
the
kangaroo
was
much
interested
well
said
she
after
listening
to
the
little
girl
that
is
just
like
you
humans
you
are
not
fit
for
this
country
at
all
of
course
if
you
have
only
one
home
in
one
place
you
lose
it
if
you
made
your
home
everywhere
and
anywhere
it
would
never
be
lost
humans
are
no
good
in
our
bush
she
continued
just
look
at
yourself
now
how
do
you
compare
with
a
kangaroo
there
is
your
ridiculous
sham
coat
well
you
have
lost
bits
of
it
all
the
way
you
have
come
and
you
nearly
left
in
your
bare
skin
now
look
at
coat
i
done
ever
so
much
more
hopping
than
you
and
you
see
i
none
the
worse
i
wonder
why
all
your
fur
grows
upon
the
top
of
your
head
she
said
reflectively
as
she
looked
curiously
at
dot
long
flaxen
curls
such
a
silly
place
to
have
one
fur
the
thickest
you
see
we
have
very
little
there
for
we
do
want
our
heads
made
any
hotter
under
the
australian
sun
see
how
much
better
off
you
would
be
now
that
nearly
all
your
sham
coat
is
gone
if
that
useless
fur
had
been
chopped
into
little
short
lengths
and
spread
all
over
your
poor
bare
body
i
wonder
why
you
humans
are
made
so
badly
she
ended
with
a
puzzled
air
dot
felt
for
a
moment
as
if
she
ought
to
apologise
for
being
so
unfit
for
the
bush
and
for
having
all
the
fur
on
the
top
of
her
head
but
somehow
she
had
an
idea
that
a
little
girl
must
be
something
better
than
a
kangaroo
although
the
kangaroo
certainly
seemed
a
very
superior
person
so
she
said
nothing
but
again
began
to
eat
the
berries
you
must
not
eat
any
more
of
these
berries
said
the
kangaroo
anxiously
why
asked
dot
they
are
very
nice
and
i
very
hungry
the
kangaroo
gently
took
the
spray
out
of
dot
hand
and
threw
it
away
you
see
she
said
if
you
eat
too
many
of
them
you
know
too
much
one
ca
know
too
much
argued
the
little
girl
yes
you
can
though
said
the
kangaroo
quickly
if
you
eat
too
many
of
those
berries
you
learn
too
much
and
that
gives
you
indigestion
and
then
you
become
miserable
i
do
want
you
to
be
miserable
any
more
for
i
going
to
find
your
way
the
mention
of
finding
her
way
reminded
the
little
girl
of
her
sad
position
which
in
her
wonder
at
talking
with
the
kangaroo
had
been
quite
forgotten
for
a
little
while
she
became
sad
again
and
seeing
how
dim
the
light
was
getting
her
thoughts
went
back
to
her
parents
she
longed
to
be
with
them
to
be
kissed
and
cuddled
and
her
blue
eyes
filled
with
tears
your
eyes
just
now
remind
me
of
two
fringed
violets
with
the
morning
dew
on
them
or
after
a
shower
said
the
kangaroo
why
are
you
crying
i
was
thinking
said
dot
oh
do
think
pleaded
the
kangaroo
i
never
do
myself
i
ca
help
it
explained
the
little
girl
what
do
you
do
instead
she
asked
i
always
jump
to
conclusions
said
the
kangaroo
and
she
promptly
bounded
ten
feet
at
one
hop
lightly
springing
back
again
to
her
position
in
front
of
the
child
she
added
and
that
why
i
never
have
a
headache
dear
kangaroo
said
dot
do
you
know
where
i
can
get
some
water
very
thirsty
of
course
you
are
said
her
friend
everyone
is
at
sundown
thirsty
myself
but
the
nearest
is
a
longish
way
off
so
we
had
better
start
at
once
little
dot
got
up
with
an
effort
after
her
long
run
and
fatigue
she
was
very
stiff
and
her
little
legs
were
so
tired
and
weak
that
after
a
few
steps
she
staggered
and
fell
the
kangaroo
looked
at
the
child
compassionately
poor
little
human
she
said
your
legs
are
much
good
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
understand
how
you
can
expect
to
get
along
without
a
tail
the
is
a
good
way
off
she
added
with
a
sigh
as
she
looked
down
at
dot
lying
on
the
ground
and
she
was
very
puzzled
what
to
do
but
suddenly
she
brightened
up
i
have
an
idea
she
said
joyfully
just
step
into
my
pouch
and
i
hop
you
down
to
the
in
less
time
than
it
takes
a
locust
to
shrill
timidly
and
carefully
dot
did
the
kangaroo
bidding
and
found
herself
in
the
cosiest
softest
little
bag
imaginable
the
kangaroo
seemed
overjoyed
when
dot
was
comfortably
settled
in
her
pouch
i
feel
as
if
i
had
my
dear
baby
kangaroo
again
she
exclaimed
and
immediately
she
bounded
away
through
the
tangled
scrub
over
stones
and
bushes
over
dry
and
great
fallen
trees
and
all
dot
felt
was
a
gentle
rocking
motion
and
a
fresh
breeze
in
her
face
which
made
her
so
cheerful
that
she
sang
this
song
if
you
want
to
go
quick
i
will
tell
you
a
trick
for
the
bush
where
there
is
a
train
with
a
hail
a
big
kangaroo
but
be
sure
that
your
weight
she
sustain
then
with
hop
and
with
skip
she
will
take
you
a
trip
with
the
speed
of
the
very
best
steed
and
this
is
a
truth
for
which
i
can
vouch
there
no
carriage
can
equal
a
kangaroo
pouch
oh
where
is
a
friend
so
strong
and
true
as
a
dear
big
bounding
kangaroo
good
bye
good
bye
the
lizards
all
cry
each
drying
its
eyes
with
its
tail
adieu
adieu
dear
kangaroo
the
scared
little
grasshoppers
wail
they
going
express
to
a
distant
address

the
bandicoot
ready
to
scoot
and
your
path
is
well
cleared
for
your
progress
i
vouch
when
you
ride
through
the
bush
in
a
kangaroo
pouch
oh
where
is
a
friend
so
strong
and
true
as
a
dear
big
bounding
kangaroo
away
and
away
you
will
certainly
say
to
the
end
of
the
farthest
blue
to
the
verge
of
the
sky
and
the
far
hills
high
o
take
me
with
thee
kangaroo
we
will
seek
for
the
end
where
the
broad
plains
tend
as
far
as
the
evening
star
why
the
end
of
the
world
we
can
reach
i
vouch
dear
kangaroo
with
me
in
your
pouch
oh
where
is
a
friend
so
strong
and
true
as
a
dear
big
bounding
kangaroo
chapter
ii
that
is
a
nice
song
of
yours
said
the
kangaroo
and
i
like
it
very
much
but
please
stop
singing
now
as
we
are
getting
near
the
for
it
not
etiquette
to
make
a
noise
near
water
at
sundown
dot
would
have
asked
why
everything
must
be
so
quiet
but
as
she
peeped
out
she
saw
that
the
kangaroo
was
making
a
very
dangerous
descent
and
she
did
not
like
to
trouble
her
friend
with
questions
just
then
they
seemed
to
be
going
down
to
a
great
deep
gully
that
looked
almost
like
a
hole
in
the
earth
the
depth
was
so
great
and
the
hills
around
came
so
closely
together
the
way
the
kangaroo
was
hopping
was
like
going
down
the
side
of
a
wall
huge
rocks
were
tumbled
about
here
and
there
some
looked
as
if
they
would
come
rolling
down
upon
them
and
others
appeared
as
if
a
little
jolt
would
send
them
crashing
and
tumbling
into
the
darkness
below
where
the
kangaroo
found
room
to
land
on
its
feet
after
each
bound
puzzled
dot
for
there
seemed
no
foothold
anywhere
it
all
looked
so
dangerous
to
the
little
girl
that
she
shut
her
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
terrible
places
they
bounded
over
or
rested
on
she
felt
sure
that
the
kangaroo
must
lose
her
balance
or
hop
just
a
little
too
far
or
a
little
too
near
and
that
they
would
fall
together
over
the
side
of
that
terrible
wild
cliff
at
last
she
said
oh
kangaroo
shall
we
get
safely
to
the
bottom
do
you
think
i
never
think
said
the
kangaroo
but
i
know
we
shall
this
is
the
easiest
way
if
i
went
through
the
thick
bush
on
the
other
side
i
should
stand
a
chance
of
running
my
head
against
a
tree
at
every
leap
unless
i
got
a
stiff
neck
with
holding
my
head
on
one
side
looking
out
of
one
eye
all
the
time
my
nose
gets
in
the
way
when
i
look
straight
in
front
she
explained
do
be
afraid
she
continued
i
know
every
jump
of
the
way
we
kangaroos
have
gone
this
way
ever
since
australia
began
to
have
kangaroos
look
here
she
said
pausing
on
a
big
boulder
that
hung
right
over
the
gully
we
have
made
a
history
book
for
ourselves
out
of
these
rocks
and
so
long
as
these
rocks
last
long
long
after
the
time
when
there
will
be
no
more
kangaroos
and
no
more
humans
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
will
look
down
upon
what
we
have
traced
on
these
stones
dot
peered
out
from
her
little
refuge
in
the
kangaroo
pouch
and
saw
the
glow
of
the
twilight
sky
reflected
on
the
top
of
the
boulder
the
rough
surface
of
the
stone
shone
with
a
beautiful
polish
like
a
for
the
rock
had
been
rubbed
for
thousands
of
years
by
the
soft
feet
and
tails
of
millions
of
kangaroos
kangaroos
that
had
hopped
down
that
way
to
get
water
when
dot
saw
that
she
did
know
why
it
all
seemed
solemn
or
why
she
felt
such
a
very
little
girl
she
was
a
little
sad
and
the
kangaroo
after
a
short
sigh
continued
her
way
as
they
neared
the
bottom
of
the
gully
the
kangaroo
became
extremely
cautious
she
no
longer
hopped
in
the
open
but
made
her
way
with
little
leaps
through
the
thick
scrub
she
peeped
out
carefully
before
each
movement
her
long
soft
ears
kept
moving
to
catch
every
sound
and
her
black
sensitive
little
nose
was
constantly
lifted
sniffing
the
air
every
now
and
then
she
gave
little
backward
starts
as
if
she
were
going
to
retreat
by
the
way
she
had
come
and
dot
with
her
face
pressed
against
the
kangaroo
soft
furry
coat
could
hear
her
heart
beating
so
fast
that
she
knew
she
was
very
frightened
they
were
not
alone
dot
could
hear
whispers
from
unseen
little
creatures
everywhere
in
the
scrub
and
from
birds
in
the
trees
high
up
in
the
branches
were
numbers
of
pigeons
sweet
little
and
above
all
the
other
sounds
she
could
hear
their
plaintive
voices
crying
we
so
frightened
we
so
frightened
so
thirsty
and
so
frightened
so
thirsty
and
so
frightened
why
do
they
drink
at
the
whispered
dot
because
they
frightened
was
the
answer
frightened
of
what
asked
dot
humans
said
the
kangaroo
in
frightened
tones
and
as
she
spoke
she
reared
up
upon
her
long
legs
and
tail
so
that
she
stood
at
least
six
feet
high
and
peeped
over
the
bushes
her
nose
working
all
round
and
her
ears
wagging
i
think
it
safe
she
said
as
she
squatted
down
again
friend
kangaroo
said
a
that
had
sidled
out
to
the
end
of
a
neighbouring
branch
you
are
so
courageous
will
you
go
first
to
the
water
and
let
us
know
if
it
is
all
safe
we
have
tasted
a
drop
of
water
for
two
days
she
said
sadly
and
we
dying
of
thirst
last
night
when
we
had
waited
for
hours
to
make
certain
there
were
no
cruel
humans
about
we
flew
down
for
a
drink
and
we
wanted
oh
so
little
just
three
little
sips
but
the
terrible
humans
with
their
murdered
numbers
of
us
then
we
flew
back
and
some
were
hurt
and
bleeding
and
died
of
their
wounds
and
none
of
us
have
dared
to
get
a
drink
since
dot
could
see
that
the
poor
pigeon
was
suffering
great
thirst
for
its
wings
were
drooping
and
its
poor
dry
beak
was
open
the
kangaroo
was
very
distressed
at
hearing
the
pigeon
story
it
is
dreadful
for
you
pigeons
she
said
because
you
can
only
drink
at
evening
we
sometimes
can
quench
our
thirst
in
the
day
i
wish
we
could
do
without
water
the
humans
know
all
the
and
sooner
or
later
we
all
get
murdered
or
die
of
thirst
how
cruel
they
are
still
the
pigeons
cried
on
we
so
thirsty
and
so
frightened
and
the
asked
the
kangaroo
to
try
again
if
she
could
either
smell
or
hear
a
human
near
the
i
think
we
are
safe
said
the
kangaroo
having
sniffed
and
listened
as
before
i
will
now
try
a
nearer
view
the
news
soon
spread
that
the
kangaroo
was
going
to
venture
near
the
water
to
see
if
all
was
safe
the
light
was
very
dim
and
there
was
a
general
whisper
that
the
attempt
to
get
a
drink
of
water
should
not
be
left
later
as
some
feared
such
foes
as
dingoes
and
night
birds
should
they
venture
into
the
open
space
at
night
as
the
kangaroo
moved
stealthily
forward
pushing
aside
the
branches
of
the
scrub
or
standing
erect
to
peep
here
and
there
there
was
absolute
silence
in
the
bush
even
the
pigeons
ceased
to
say
they
were
afraid
but
hopped
silently
from
bough
to
bough
following
the
movements
of
the
kangaroo
with
eager
little
eyes
the
brush
turkey
and
the
left
their
nests
and
joined
the
other
thirsty
creatures
and
only
by
the
crackling
of
the
dry
scrub
or
the
falling
of
a
few
leaves
could
one
tell
that
so
many
live
creatures
were
together
in
that
wild
place
presently
the
kangaroo
had
reached
the
last
bushes
of
the
scrub
behind
which
she
crouched
there
not
a
smell
or
a
sound
she
said
get
out
dot
and
wait
here
until
i
return
and
the
have
had
their
drink
for
did
they
see
you
they
would
be
too
frightened
to
come
down
and
would
have
to
wait
another
night
and
day
dot
got
out
of
the
pouch
and
she
was
very
sorry
when
she
saw
how
terrified
her
friend
looked
she
could
see
the
fur
on
the
chest
moving
with
the
frightened
beating
of
her
heart
and
her
beautiful
brown
eyes
looked
wild
and
strange
with
fear
instantly
the
kangaroo
leaped
into
the
open
for
a
second
she
paused
erect
sniffing
and
listening
and
then
she
hastened
to
the
water
as
she
stooped
to
drink
dot
heard
a
whrr
whrr
whrr
and
like
falling
leaves
down
swept
the
it
was
a
wonderful
sight
the
shone
in
the
dim
light
with
the
great
black
darkness
of
the
trees
surrounding
it
and
from
all
parts
came
the
thirsty
creatures
of
the
bush
the
were
all
together
hundred
of
little
heads
bobbed
by
the
edge
of
the
pool
as
the
little
bills
were
filled
and
the
precious
water
was
swallowed
then
together
a
minute
afterwards
whrr
whrr
whrr
up
they
flew
and
in
one
great
sweeping
circle
they
regained
their
like
the
bush
creatures
dot
also
was
frightened
and
running
to
the
water
hurriedly
drank
and
fled
back
to
the
shelter
of
the
bush
where
the
kangaroo
was
waiting
for
her
jump
in
said
the
kangaroo
it
never
safe
by
the
water
and
a
minute
after
dot
was
again
in
the
cosy
pouch
and
was
hurrying
away
like
all
the
others
from
the
water
where
men
are
wont
to
camp
and
kill
with
their
guns
the
poor
creatures
that
come
to
drink
that
evening
the
kangaroo
tried
to
persuade
dot
to
eat
some
grass
but
as
dot
said
she
had
never
eaten
grass
it
got
some
roots
from
a
friendly
bandicoot
which
the
little
girl
ate
because
she
was
hungry
but
she
thought
she
would
like
to
be
a
bandicoot
always
to
eat
such
food
then
in
a
nice
dry
cave
she
nestled
into
the
fur
of
the
gentle
kangaroo
and
was
so
tired
that
she
slept
immediately
she
only
woke
up
once
she
had
been
dreaming
that
she
was
at
home
and
was
playing
with
the
new
little
calf
that
had
come
the
day
before
she
was
lost
and
she
could
remember
at
first
waking
what
had
happened
or
where
she
was
it
was
dark
in
the
cave
and
outside
the
bushes
and
trees
looked
quite
black
for
there
was
but
little
light
in
that
place
from
the
starry
sky
it
seemed
terribly
lonesome
and
wild
when
the
kangaroo
spoke
she
remembered
everything
and
they
both
sat
up
and
talked
a
little
sang
the
nightjar
in
the
distance
i
wish
the
nightjar
would
make
that
noise
when
one
wants
to
sleep
said
the
kangaroo
it
has
got
any
voice
to
speak
of
and
the
tune
is
stupid
it
gives
me
the
for
it
reminds
me
i
lost
my
baby
kangaroo
there
is
something
wrong
about
some
birds
that
think
themselves
musical
she
continued
they
are
well
behaved
and
considerate
enough
in
the
day
but
as
soon
as
it
is
a
nice
quiet
calm
night
or
a
bit
of
a
moon
is
in
the
sky
they
make
night
hideous
to
everyone
within
earshot
oh
it
gives
me
the
blues
as
the
kangaroo
spoke
she
hopped
to
the
front
of
the
cave
i
say
nightjar
she
said
i
a
little
sad
please
go
and
sing
elsewhere
ah
said
the
nightjar
i
so
glad
i
given
you
deliciously
dismal
thoughts
with
my
song
i
a
great
artist
and
can
touch
all
hearts
that
is
my
mission
in
the
world
when
all
the
bush
is
quiet
and
everyone
has
time
to
be
miserable
i
make
them
more
so
is
it
lovely
to
be
like
that
i
rather
you
sang
something
cheerful
said
the
kangaroo
to
herself
but
out
loud
she
said
i
find
it
really
too
beautiful
it
is
more
than
i
can
bear
please
go
a
little
farther
off
croaked
the
nightjar
farther
and
farther
in
the
distance
as
it
flew
away
what
a
pity
said
the
kangaroo
as
she
returned
to
the
cave
the
made
that
unlucky
joke
of
telling
the
nightjar
it
has
a
touching
voice
and
can
sing
everyone
has
to
suffer
for
that
joke
of
the
it
does
matter
to
him
for
he
is
awake
all
night
but
it
is
too
bad
for
his
neighbours
who
want
to
sleep
just
then
there
arose
from
the
bush
a
shrill
wailing
and
shrieking
that
made
dot
heart
stop
with
fear
it
sounded
terrible
as
if
something
was
wailing
in
great
pain
and
suffering
o
kangaroo
she
cried
what
is
the
matter
that
said
the
kangaroo
as
she
laid
herself
down
to
rest
is
the
sound
of
the
curlew
enjoying
itself
they
are
sociable
birds
and
entertain
a
great
deal
there
is
a
party
i
suppose
and
that
is
the
expression
of
their
enjoyment
i
believe
she
continued
with
a
suppressed
yawn
it
not
so
painful
as
it
sounds
willy
wagtail
who
goes
a
great
deal
amongst
humans
says
they
do
that
sort
of
thing
also
he
has
often
heard
them
when
he
lived
near
the
town
dot
had
never
been
in
the
town
but
she
was
certain
she
had
never
heard
anything
like
the
curlew
wailing
in
her
home
and
she
wondered
what
willy
wagtail
meant
but
she
was
too
sleepy
to
ask
so
she
nestled
a
little
closer
to
the
kangaroo
and
with
the
shrieking
of
the
curlews
and
the
mournful
note
of
the
distant
in
her
ears
she
fell
asleep
again
chapter
iii
when
dot
awoke
she
did
so
with
a
start
of
fear
something
in
her
sleep
had
seemed
to
tell
her
that
she
was
in
danger
at
a
first
glance
she
saw
that
the
kangaroo
had
left
her
and
coiled
upon
her
body
was
a
young
black
snake
before
dot
could
move
she
heard
a
voice
from
a
tree
outside
the
cave
say
very
softly
do
be
afraid
keep
quite
still
and
you
will
not
get
hurt
presently
i
kill
that
snake
if
i
tried
to
do
so
now
it
might
bite
you
so
let
it
sleep
on
she
looked
up
in
the
direction
of
the
tree
and
saw
a
big
kookooburra
perched
on
a
bough
with
all
the
creamy
feathers
of
its
breast
fluffed
out
and
its
crest
very
high
the
kookooburra
is
one
of
the
jolliest
birds
in
the
bush
and
is
always
cracking
jokes
and
laughing
but
this
one
was
keeping
as
quiet
as
he
could
still
he
could
not
be
quite
serious
and
a
smile
played
all
round
his
huge
beak
dot
could
see
that
he
was
nearly
bursting
with
suppressed
laughter
he
kept
on
saying
under
his
breath
what
a
joke
this
is
what
a
capital
joke
how
all
laugh
when
i
tell
them
just
as
if
it
was
the
funniest
thing
in
the
world
to
have
a
snake
coiled
up
on
one
body
when
the
horrid
thing
might
bite
one
with
its
poisonous
fangs
at
any
moment
dot
said
she
did
see
any
joke
and
it
was
no
laughing
matter
to
be
sure
do
see
the
joke
said
the
jovial
bird
always
see
the
jokes
and
i
an
it
not
to
be
expected
of
you
because
you
not
an
and
he
shook
with
suppressed
laughter
again
where
is
my
dear
kangaroo
asked
dot
she
has
gone
to
get
you
some
berries
for
breakfast
said
the
kookooburra
and
she
asked
me
to
look
after
you
and
that
why
here
that
snake
got
on
you
whilst
i
flew
away
to
consult
my
doctor
the
white
owl
about
the
terrible
indigestion
i
have
he
very
difficult
to
catch
awake
for
he
out
all
night
and
sleepy
all
day
he
says
cockchafers
have
caused
it
the
horny
and
legs
are
most
indigestible
he
assures
me
i
did
fancy
them
much
when
i
ate
them
last
night
so
i
took
his
advice
and
coughed
them
up
and
i
no
longer
feeling
depressed
take
my
advice
and
do
eat
cockchafers
little
human
dot
did
not
really
hear
all
this
nor
heed
the
excellent
advice
of
the
kookooburra
not
to
eat
those
hard
green
beetles
that
had
disagreed
with
it
for
a
little
shivering
movement
had
gone
through
the
snake
and
presently
all
the
scales
of
its
shining
black
back
and
rosy
underpart
began
to
move
dot
felt
quite
sick
as
she
saw
the
reptile
begin
to
uncoil
itself
as
it
lay
upon
her
she
hardly
dared
to
breathe
but
lay
as
still
as
if
she
were
dead
so
as
not
to
frighten
or
anger
the
horrid
creature
which
presently
seemed
to
slip
like
a
slimy
cord
over
her
bare
legs
and
wriggled
away
to
the
entrance
of
the
cave
with
a
quick
delighted
movement
she
sat
up
eager
to
see
where
the
deadly
snake
would
go
it
was
very
drowsy
having
slept
heavily
on
warm
little
body
so
it
went
slowly
towards
the
bush
to
get
some
frogs
or
birds
for
breakfast
but
as
it
wriggled
into
the
warm
morning
sunlight
outside
dot
saw
a
sight
that
made
her
clap
her
hands
together
with
anxiety
for
the
life
of
the
jolly
kookooburra
no
sooner
did
the
black
snake
get
outside
the
cave
than
she
saw
the
kookooburra
fall
like
a
stone
from
its
branch
right
on
top
of
the
snake
for
a
second
dot
thought
the
bird
must
have
tumbled
down
dead
it
was
such
a
sudden
fall
but
a
moment
later
she
saw
it
flutter
on
the
ground
in
battle
with
the
poisonous
reptile
whilst
the
snake
wriggled
and
coiled
its
body
into
hoops
and
rings
the
kookooburra
strong
wings
beating
the
air
just
above
the
writhing
snake
made
a
great
noise
and
the
serpent
hissed
in
its
fierce
hatred
and
anger
then
dot
saw
that
the
kookooburra
big
beak
had
a
firm
hold
of
the
snake
by
the
back
of
the
neck
and
that
it
was
trying
to
fly
upwards
with
its
enemy
in
vain
the
dreadful
creature
tried
to
bite
the
gallant
bird
in
vain
it
hissed
and
stuck
out
its
wicked
little
spiky
tongue
in
vain
it
tried
to
coil
itself
round
the
bird
body
the
kookooburra
was
too
strong
and
too
clever
to
lose
its
hold
or
to
let
the
snake
get
power
over
it
at
last
dot
saw
that
the
snake
was
getting
weaker
and
weaker
for
little
by
little
the
kookooburra
was
able
to
rise
higher
with
it
until
it
reached
the
high
bough
all
the
time
the
snake
was
held
in
the
beak
writhing
and
coiling
in
agony
for
he
knew
that
the
kookooburra
had
won
the
battle
but
when
the
noble
bird
had
reached
its
perch
it
did
a
strange
thing
for
it
dropped
the
snake
right
down
to
the
ground
then
it
flew
down
again
and
brought
the
reptile
back
to
the
bough
and
dropped
it
once
more
and
this
it
did
many
times
each
time
the
snake
moved
less
and
less
for
its
back
was
being
broken
by
these
falls
at
last
the
kookooburra
flew
up
with
its
victim
for
the
last
time
and
holding
it
on
the
branch
with
its
foot
beat
the
serpent
head
with
its
great
strong
beak
dot
could
hear
the
blows
fall
whack
whack
whack
as
the
beak
smote
the
snake
head
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
until
it
lay
limp
and
dead
across
the
bough
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
ah
laughed
the
kookooburra
and
said
to
dot
did
you
see
all
that
was
it
a
joke
what
a
capital
joke
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
oh
oh
oh
how
my
sides
do
ache
what
a
joke
how
laugh
when
i
tell
them
then
came
a
great
flight
of
kookooburras
for
they
had
heard
the
laughter
and
all
wanted
to
know
what
the
joke
was
proudly
the
kookooburra
told
them
all
about
the
snake
sleeping
on
dot
and
the
great
fight
all
the
time
first
one
kookooburra
and
then
another
chuckled
over
the
story
and
when
it
came
to
an
end
every
bird
dropped
its
wings
cocked
up
its
tail
and
throwing
back
its
head
opened
its
great
beak
and
all
laughed
uproariously
together
dot
was
nearly
deafened
by
the
noise
for
some
chuckled
some
cackled
some
said
ha
ha
ha
others
said
oh
oh
oh
and
as
soon
as
one
left
off
another
began
until
it
seemed
as
though
they
could
stop
they
all
said
it
was
a
splendid
joke
and
that
they
really
must
go
and
tell
it
to
the
whole
bush
so
they
flew
away
and
far
and
near
for
hours
the
bush
echoed
with
chuckling
and
cackling
and
wild
bursts
of
laughter
as
the
kookooburras
told
that
grand
joke
everywhere
now
said
the
kookooburra
when
all
the
others
had
gone
a
bit
of
snake
is
just
the
right
thing
for
breakfast
will
you
have
some
little
human
dot
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
eating
snake
for
breakfast
and
the
kookooburra
thought
she
was
afraid
of
being
poisoned
it
wo
hurt
you
he
said
kindly
i
took
care
that
it
did
not
bite
itself
sometimes
they
do
that
when
they
are
dying
and
then
they
not
good
to
eat
but
this
snake
is
all
right
and
wo
disagree
like
cockchafers
the
scales
are
quite
soft
and
digestible
he
added
but
dot
said
she
would
rather
wait
for
the
berries
the
kangaroo
was
bringing
so
the
kookooburra
remarked
that
if
she
would
excuse
it
he
would
like
to
begin
breakfast
at
once
as
the
fight
had
made
him
hungry
then
dot
saw
him
hold
the
reptile
on
the
branch
with
his
foot
whilst
he
took
its
tail
into
his
beak
and
proceeded
to
swallow
it
in
a
leisurely
way
in
fact
the
kookooburra
was
so
slow
that
very
little
of
the
snake
had
disappeared
when
the
kangaroo
returned
illustration
the
fight
between
the
kookooburra
and
the
snake
the
kangaroo
had
brought
a
pouch
full
of
berries
and
in
her
hand
a
small
spray
of
the
magic
ones
by
eating
which
dot
was
able
to
understand
the
talk
of
all
the
bush
creatures
all
the
time
she
was
wandering
in
the
bush
the
kangaroo
gave
her
some
of
these
to
eat
daily
and
dot
soon
found
that
the
effect
of
these
strange
berries
only
lasted
until
the
next
day
the
kangaroo
emptied
out
her
pouch
and
dot
found
quite
a
large
collection
of
roots
buds
and
berries
which
she
ate
with
good
appetite
the
kangaroo
watched
her
eating
with
a
look
of
quiet
satisfaction
see
she
said
how
easily
one
can
live
in
the
bush
without
hurting
anyone
and
yet
humans
live
by
murdering
creatures
and
devouring
them
if
they
are
lost
in
the
scrub
they
die
because
they
know
no
other
way
to
live
than
that
cruel
one
of
destroying
us
all
humans
have
become
so
cruel
that
they
kill
and
kill
not
even
for
food
but
for
the
love
of
murdering
i
often
wonder
she
said
why
they
and
the
dingoes
are
allowed
to
live
on
this
beautiful
kind
earth
the
black
humans
kill
and
devour
us
but
they
even
are
not
so
terrible
as
the
whites
who
delight
in
taking
our
lives
and
torturing
us
just
as
an
amusement
every
creature
in
the
bush
weeps
that
they
should
have
come
to
take
the
beautiful
bush
away
from
us
dot
saw
that
the
sad
brown
eyes
of
the
kangaroo
were
full
of
tears
and
she
cried
too
as
she
thought
of
all
that
the
poor
animals
and
birds
suffer
at
the
hands
of
white
men
dear
kangaroo
she
said
if
i
ever
get
home
i
tell
everyone
of
how
you
unhappy
creatures
live
in
fear
and
suffer
and
ask
them
not
to
kill
you
poor
things
any
more
but
the
kangaroo
sadly
shook
her
head
and
said
white
humans
are
cruel
and
love
to
murder
we
must
all
die
but
about
your
lost
way
she
continued
in
a
brisk
tone
by
way
of
changing
this
painful
subject
i
been
asking
about
it
and
no
one
has
seen
it
anywhere
of
course
someone
must
know
where
it
is
but
the
difficulty
is
to
find
the
right
one
to
ask
then
she
dropped
her
voice
and
came
a
little
nearer
to
dot
and
stooping
down
until
her
little
black
hands
hung
close
to
the
ground
she
whispered
in
dot
ear
they
say
i
ought
to
consult
the
platypus
could
the
platypus
help
do
you
think
dot
asked
i
think
said
the
kangaroo
but
as
the
platypus
never
goes
anywhere
never
associates
with
any
other
creature
and
is
hardly
ever
seen
i
conclude
it
knows
everything
it
must
you
know
of
course
said
dot
with
some
doubt
in
her
tone
the
only
thing
is
continued
the
kangaroo
once
more
sitting
up
and
pensively
scratching
her
nose
the
only
thing
is
i
ca
bear
the
platypus
the
sight
of
it
gives
me
the
creeps
it
such
a
queer
creature
i
never
seen
a
platypus
said
dot
do
tell
me
what
it
is
like
i
could
describe
it
said
the
kangaroo
with
a
shudder
it
seems
made
up
of
parts
of
two
or
three
different
sorts
of
creatures
none
of
us
can
account
for
it
it
must
have
been
an
experiment
when
all
the
rest
of
us
were
made
or
else
it
was
made
up
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
the
birds
and
beasts
that
were
left
over
after
we
were
all
finished
little
dot
clapped
her
hands
oh
dear
kangaroo
she
said
do
take
me
to
see
the
platypus
there
was
nothing
like
that
in
my
noah
ark
i
should
say
not
remarked
the
kangaroo
the
animals
in
the
ark
said
they
were
each
to
be
of
its
kind
and
every
sort
of
bird
and
beast
refused
to
admit
the
platypus
because
it
was
of
so
many
kinds
and
at
last
noah
turned
it
out
to
swim
for
itself
because
there
was
such
a
row
that
why
the
platypus
is
so
secluded
ever
since
then
no
platypus
is
friendly
with
any
other
creature
and
no
animal
or
bird
is
more
than
just
polite
to
it
they
could
be
you
see
because
of
that
trouble
in
the
ark
but
that
was
so
long
ago
said
dot
filled
with
compassion
for
the
lonely
platypus
and
after
all
this
is
not
the
same
platypus
nor
are
all
the
bush
creatures
the
same
now
as
then
no
returned
the
kangaroo
and
some
say
there
was
no
ark
and
no
fuss
over
the
matter
but
that
of
course
does
make
any
difference
for
it
a
very
ancient
quarrel
so
it
must
be
kept
up
but
if
we
are
to
go
to
the
platypus
we
had
better
start
now
it
is
a
good
time
to
see
it
so
come
along
little
dot
said
the
kangaroo
chapter
iv
kookooburra
cried
dot
as
they
left
the
cave
and
the
bird
gave
her
a
nod
of
the
head
followed
by
a
wink
which
was
supposed
to
mean
hearty
at
parting
he
would
have
spoken
only
he
had
swallowed
but
part
of
the
snake
and
the
rest
hung
out
of
the
side
of
his
beak
like
an
old
man
pipe
so
he
could
speak
it
would
have
been
polite
to
do
so
with
his
beak
full
dot
was
so
rested
by
her
sleep
all
night
that
she
did
not
ride
in
the
kangaroo
pouch
but
they
proceeded
together
she
walking
and
her
friend
making
as
small
hops
as
she
could
so
as
not
to
get
too
far
ahead
this
was
very
difficult
for
the
kangaroo
because
even
the
smallest
hops
carried
her
far
in
front
after
a
time
they
arranged
that
the
friendly
animal
should
hop
a
few
yards
then
wait
for
dot
to
catch
her
up
and
then
go
on
again
this
she
did
nibbling
bits
of
grass
as
she
waited
or
playing
a
little
game
of
behind
the
bushes
sometimes
when
she
hid
like
this
dot
would
be
afraid
that
she
had
lost
her
kangaroo
and
would
run
here
and
there
hunting
round
trees
and
clusters
of
ferns
until
she
felt
quite
certain
she
had
lost
the
kind
animal
when
suddenly
clean
over
a
big
bush
the
kangaroo
would
bound
into
view
landing
right
in
front
of
her
then
dot
would
laugh
and
rush
forward
and
throw
her
arms
around
her
friend
and
the
kangaroo
with
a
quiet
smile
would
rub
her
little
head
against
dot
curls
and
they
were
both
very
happy
so
although
it
was
a
long
and
rough
way
to
the
little
creek
where
the
platypus
lived
it
did
not
seem
at
all
far
the
stream
ran
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
gully
that
had
high
rocky
sides
with
strangely
shaped
trees
growing
between
the
rocks
but
by
the
stream
dot
thought
they
must
be
in
fairyland
it
was
so
beautiful
in
the
dark
hollows
of
the
rocks
were
wonderful
ferns
such
delicate
ones
that
the
little
girl
was
afraid
to
touch
them
they
were
so
tender
and
green
that
they
could
only
grow
far
away
from
the
sun
and
as
she
peeped
into
the
hollows
and
caves
where
they
grew
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
being
shown
the
secret
of
nature
where
she
kept
all
the
most
lovely
plants
out
of
sight
of
the
world
a
soft
carpet
seemed
to
spring
under
dot
feet
like
a
nice
springy
mattress
as
she
trotted
along
she
asked
the
kangaroo
why
the
earth
was
so
soft
and
was
told
that
it
was
not
earth
but
the
dead
leaves
of
the
above
them
that
had
been
falling
for
such
a
long
long
time
that
no
kangaroo
could
remember
the
beginning
then
dot
looked
up
and
saw
that
there
was
no
sky
to
be
seen
for
they
were
passing
under
a
forest
of
and
their
lovely
spreading
fronds
made
a
perfect
green
tent
over
their
heads
the
sunlight
that
came
through
was
green
as
if
you
were
in
a
house
made
of
green
glass
all
up
the
slender
stems
of
these
tall
were
the
most
beautiful
little
plants
and
many
stems
were
twined
from
the
earth
to
their
fronds
with
tender
creeping
ferns
the
fronds
of
which
were
so
fine
and
close
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
were
wrapped
up
in
a
lovely
little
fern
coat
even
crumbling
dead
trees
and
decaying
did
not
look
dead
because
some
beautiful
moss
or
lichen
or
little
ferns
had
clung
to
them
and
made
them
more
beautiful
than
when
alive
dot
kept
crying
out
with
pleasure
at
all
she
saw
especially
when
little
parrakeets
with
feathers
as
green
as
the
ferns
and
gorgeous
red
breasts
came
in
flocks
and
welcomed
her
to
their
favourite
haunt
and
as
she
had
eaten
the
berries
of
understanding
and
was
the
friend
of
the
kangaroo
they
were
not
frightened
but
perched
on
her
shoulders
and
hands
and
chatted
their
merry
talk
together
the
kangaroo
did
not
share
dot
enthusiasm
for
the
beauties
of
the
gully
she
said
it
was
pretty
certainly
but
a
bad
place
for
kangaroos
because
there
was
no
grass
for
her
part
she
did
think
any
sight
in
nature
so
lovely
as
a
big
plain
green
with
the
little
blades
of
new
spring
grass
the
gully
was
very
showy
but
not
to
her
mind
so
beautiful
as
the
other
then
they
came
to
a
stream
that
gurgled
melodiously
as
it
rippled
over
stones
in
its
shallow
course
or
crept
round
big
grey
boulders
that
were
wrapped
in
thick
mosses
in
which
were
mingled
flowers
of
the
pink
and
red
wild
fuchsia
or
the
creamy
great
blossoms
of
the
rock
lily
dot
ran
down
the
stream
with
bare
feet
laughing
as
she
paddled
in
and
out
among
the
rocks
and
ferns
and
the
sun
shone
down
on
the
gleaming
foam
of
the
water
and
made
golden
lights
in
dot
wild
curls
the
kangaroo
too
was
very
merry
and
bounded
from
rock
to
rock
over
the
stream
showing
what
wonderful
things
she
could
do
in
that
way
and
sometimes
they
paused
side
by
side
and
peeped
down
upon
some
still
pool
that
showed
their
two
reflections
as
in
a
mirror
and
that
seemed
so
funny
to
dot
that
her
silvery
laugh
woke
the
silence
in
happy
peals
until
more
parrakeets
flew
out
of
the
bush
to
join
in
the
fun
illustration
dot
and
the
kangaroo
on
their
way
to
the
platypus
when
they
had
followed
the
stream
some
distance
the
gully
opened
out
into
bush
scrub
the
little
parrakeets
then
said
and
flew
back
to
their
favourite
and
bush
growth
and
the
kangaroo
said
that
as
they
were
nearing
the
home
of
the
platypus
they
must
not
play
in
the
stream
any
more
to
do
so
might
warn
the
creature
of
their
approach
and
frighten
it
we
shall
have
to
be
very
careful
she
said
so
that
the
platypus
will
neither
hear
nor
smell
you
we
will
therefore
walk
on
the
opposite
shore
as
the
wind
will
then
blow
away
from
its
home
the
stream
no
longer
chattered
over
rocky
beds
but
slid
between
soft
banks
of
earth
under
tufts
of
tall
rushes
grasses
and
ferns
and
soon
it
opened
into
a
broad
pool
which
was
smooth
as
glass
the
clouds
in
the
sky
the
tall
surrounding
trees
and
the
graceful
ferns
and
rushes
of
the
banks
were
all
reflected
in
the
water
so
that
it
looked
to
dot
like
a
strange
picture
this
then
was
the
home
of
that
wonderful
animal
and
dot
felt
quite
frightened
because
she
thought
she
was
going
to
see
something
terrible
at
the
kangaroo
bidding
she
hid
a
little
way
from
the
edge
of
the
pool
but
she
was
able
to
see
all
that
happened
the
kangaroo
evidently
did
not
enjoy
the
prospect
of
conversing
with
the
platypus
she
kept
on
fidgetting
about
putting
off
calling
to
the
platypus
by
one
excuse
and
another
she
was
decidedly
ill
at
ease
are
you
frightened
of
the
platypus
asked
dot
dear
me
no
replied
the
kangaroo
but
i
rather
have
a
talk
with
any
other
bush
creature
first
of
all
the
sight
of
it
makes
me
so
uncomfortable
that
i
want
to
hop
away
the
instant
i
set
eyes
upon
it
then
too
it
so
difficult
to
be
polite
to
the
platypus
because
one
never
knows
how
to
behave
towards
it
if
you
treat
it
as
an
animal
you
offend
its
bird
nature
and
if
you
treat
it
as
a
bird
the
animal
in
it
is
mighty
indignant
one
never
knows
where
one
is
with
a
creature
that
is
two
creatures
said
the
kangaroo
dot
was
so
sorry
for
the
perplexity
of
her
friend
that
she
suggested
that
they
should
not
consult
the
platypus
but
the
kangaroo
said
it
must
be
done
because
no
one
in
the
bush
was
so
learned
being
such
a
strange
creature
and
living
in
such
seclusion
and
being
so
difficult
to
approach
was
a
proof
that
it
was
the
right
adviser
to
seek
so
with
a
half
desperate
air
the
kangaroo
left
the
little
girl
and
went
down
to
the
water
edge
pausing
a
moment
she
made
a
strange
little
noise
that
was
something
between
a
grunt
and
a
hiss
and
she
repeated
this
many
times
at
last
dot
saw
what
looked
like
a
bit
of
black
stick
just
above
the
surface
of
the
pool
coming
towards
their
side
and
as
it
moved
forward
leaving
two
little
silvery
ripples
that
widened
out
behind
it
on
the
smooth
waters
presently
the
black
stick
which
was
the
bill
of
the
platypus
reached
the
bank
and
the
strangest
little
creature
climbed
into
view
dot
had
expected
to
see
something
big
and
hideous
but
here
was
quite
a
small
object
after
all
it
seemed
quite
ridiculous
that
the
great
kangaroo
should
be
evidently
discomposed
by
the
sight
dot
could
not
hear
what
the
kangaroo
said
but
she
saw
the
platypus
hurriedly
prepare
to
regain
the
water
it
began
to
stumble
clumsily
down
the
bank
the
kangaroo
then
raised
her
voice
in
pleading
accents
but
she
said
it
such
a
little
human
i
have
treated
it
like
my
baby
kangaroo
and
have
carried
it
in
my
pouch
this
information
seemed
to
arrest
the
movements
of
the
platypus
it
had
reached
the
water
edge
but
it
paused
and
turned
i
tell
you
it
said
in
a
and
irritable
voice
that
all
humans
are
alike
they
all
come
here
to
interview
me
for
the
same
purpose
and
i
resolved
it
shall
not
happen
again
i
have
been
insulted
enough
by
their
ignorance
i
assure
you
urged
the
kangaroo
that
she
will
not
annoy
you
in
that
way
she
would
think
of
doing
such
a
thing
to
any
animal
as
the
kangaroo
called
the
platypus
an
animal
dot
saw
at
once
that
it
was
offended
and
in
a
great
huff
it
turned
towards
the
pool
again
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
kangaroo
nervously
i
did
mean
an
altogether
animal
or
even
a
bird
but
any
a
a
a
she
seemed
puzzled
how
to
speak
of
the
platypus
when
the
strange
creature
seeing
the
embarrassment
of
the
kangaroo
said
affably
any
mammal
or
ornithorhynchus
paradoxus
exactly
said
the
kangaroo
brightening
up
although
she
had
the
least
idea
what
a
mammal
was
well
bring
the
little
human
here
said
the
platypus
in
a
more
friendly
tone
and
if
i
feel
quite
sure
on
that
point
i
will
permit
an
interview
two
bounds
brought
the
kangaroo
to
where
dot
was
hidden
she
seemed
anxious
that
the
child
should
make
a
good
impression
on
the
platypus
and
tried
with
the
long
claws
on
her
little
black
hands
to
comb
through
dot
long
gleaming
curls
but
they
were
so
tangled
that
the
child
called
out
at
this
awkward
method
of
hairdressing
and
the
kangaroo
stopped
she
then
licked
a
black
smudge
off
dot
forehead
which
was
all
she
could
do
to
tidy
her
then
she
started
back
a
hop
and
eyed
the
child
with
her
head
on
one
side
she
was
not
quite
satisfied
ah
she
said
if
only
you
were
a
baby
kangaroo
i
could
make
you
look
so
nice
but
i
ca
do
anything
to
your
sham
coat
which
gets
worse
every
day
and
your
fur
is
all
wrong
for
one
ca
get
one
claws
through
it
you
humans
are
no
good
in
the
bush
never
mind
dear
kangaroo
said
the
little
girl
when
i
get
home
mother
will
put
me
on
a
new
frock
and
will
get
the
tangles
out
of
my
hair
let
us
go
to
the
platypus
now
the
kangaroo
felt
sad
as
dot
spoke
of
returning
home
for
she
had
become
really
fond
of
the
little
human
she
began
to
feel
that
she
would
be
lonely
when
they
parted
however
she
did
not
speak
of
what
was
in
her
mind
but
bounded
back
to
the
platypus
to
wait
for
dot
when
the
little
girl
reached
the
pool
she
was
still
more
surprised
on
a
nearer
view
of
the
platypus
that
the
kangaroo
should
think
so
much
of
it
at
her
feet
she
beheld
a
creature
like
a
shapeless
bit
of
wet
matted
fur
she
thought
it
looked
like
an
empty
fur
bag
that
had
been
fished
out
of
the
water
projecting
from
the
head
that
seemed
much
nearer
to
the
ground
than
the
back
was
a
broad
duck
bill
of
a
dirty
grey
colour
and
peeping
out
underneath
were
two
fore
feet
that
were
like
a
duck
also
altogether
it
was
such
a
funny
object
that
she
was
inclined
to
laugh
only
the
kangaroo
looked
so
serious
that
she
tried
to
look
serious
too
as
if
there
was
nothing
strange
in
the
appearance
of
the
platypus
i
am
the
ornithorhynchus
paradoxus
said
the
platypus
pompously
i
am
dot
said
the
little
girl
now
we
know
one
another
names
said
the
platypus
with
satisfaction
if
the
kangaroo
had
introduced
us
it
would
have
stumbled
over
my
name
and
mumbled
yours
and
we
should
have
been
none
the
wiser
now
tell
me
little
human
are
you
going
to
write
a
book
about
me
because
if
you
are
i
off
i
ca
stand
any
more
books
being
written
about
me
been
annoyed
enough
that
way
i
could
write
a
book
said
dot
with
surprise
inwardly
wondering
what
anyone
could
find
to
make
a
book
of
out
of
such
a
small
ugly
creature
you
quite
sure
asked
the
platypus
doubtfully
and
evidently
more
than
half
inclined
to
dive
into
the
pool
quite
said
dot
then
i
try
to
believe
you
said
the
platypus
clumsily
waddling
towards
some
grass
amongst
which
it
settled
itself
comfortably
but
it
very
difficult
to
believe
you
humans
for
you
tell
such
dreadful
fibs
it
continued
as
it
squirted
some
dirty
water
out
of
the
bag
that
surrounded
its
bill
and
swallowed
some
water
beetles
small
snails
and
mud
that
it
had
stored
there
see
for
instance
the
way
you
have
all
quarrelled
and
lied
about
me
one
great
human
the
biggest
fool
of
all
said
i
was
a
live
creature
at
all
but
a
joke
another
human
had
played
upon
him
then
they
squabbled
together
one
saying
i
was
a
beaver
another
that
i
was
a
duck
another
that
i
was
a
mole
or
a
rat
then
they
argued
whether
i
was
a
bird
or
an
animal
or
if
we
laid
eggs
or
not
and
everyone
wrote
a
book
full
of
lies
all
out
of
his
head
that
the
way
humans
amuse
themselves
they
write
books
about
things
they
do
understand
and
each
new
book
says
all
the
others
are
all
wrong
it
a
silly
game
and
very
insulting
to
the
creatures
they
write
about
humans
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
who
never
took
the
trouble
to
come
here
to
see
me
wrote
books
about
me
those
who
did
come
were
more
impudent
than
those
who
stayed
away
their
idea
of
learning
all
about
a
creature
was
to
dig
up
its
home
and
frighten
it
out
of
its
wits
and
kill
it
and
after
a
few
moons
of
that
sort
of
foolery
they
claimed
to
know
all
about
us
us
whose
ancestors
knew
the
world
millions
of
years
before
the
ignorant
humans
came
on
the
earth
at
all
the
platypus
spluttered
out
more
dirty
water
in
its
indignation
the
kangaroo
became
very
timid
as
it
saw
the
rising
anger
of
the
platypus
and
it
whispered
to
dot
to
say
something
to
calm
the
little
creature
a
million
years
is
a
very
long
time
said
dot
unable
at
the
moment
to
think
of
anything
better
to
say
but
this
remark
angered
the
platypus
more
for
it
seemed
to
suspect
dot
of
doubting
what
it
said
it
clambered
up
into
a
more
erect
position
and
its
little
brown
eyes
became
quite
fiery
i
did
say
a
million
i
said
millions
i
can
prove
by
a
bone
in
my
body
that
my
ancestors
were
the
amphitherium
the
amphilestes
the
phascolotherium
and
the
stereognathus
almost
shrieked
the
little
creature
illustration
the
prehistoric
creatures
of
the
platypus
song
dot
did
understand
what
all
these
words
meant
and
looked
at
the
kangaroo
for
an
explanation
but
she
saw
that
the
kangaroo
understand
either
only
she
was
trying
to
hide
her
ignorance
by
a
calm
appearance
while
she
nibbled
the
end
of
a
long
grass
she
held
in
her
fore
paw
but
dot
noticed
by
the
slight
trembling
of
the
little
black
paw
that
the
kangaroo
was
very
nervous
she
thought
she
would
try
and
say
something
to
please
platypus
so
she
asked
very
kindly
if
the
bone
ever
hurt
it
but
this
strange
creature
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
remark
settling
itself
more
comfortably
amongst
the
grass
it
muttered
in
calmer
tones
i
trace
my
ancestry
back
to
the
oolite
age
where
does
man
come
in
i
do
know
said
dot
of
course
you
do
replied
the
platypus
contemptuously
humans
are
so
ignorant
that
is
because
they
are
so
new
when
they
have
existed
a
few
more
million
years
they
will
be
more
like
us
of
old
families
they
will
respect
quiet
exclusive
living
like
that
of
the
ornithorhynchus
paradoxus
and
will
not
be
so
inquisitive
pushing
and
dangerous
as
now
the
age
will
come
when
they
will
understand
and
will
cease
to
write
books
and
there
will
be
peace
for
everyone
the
kangaroo
now
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
to
change
the
subject
and
gently
introduced
the
topic
of
dot
lost
way
saying
how
she
had
found
the
little
girl
and
had
taken
care
of
her
ever
since
the
platypus
did
not
seem
interested
and
yawned
more
than
once
whilst
the
kangaroo
spoke
the
question
is
concluded
the
kangaroo
who
shall
i
ask
to
find
it
someone
must
know
where
it
is
of
course
said
the
platypus
yawning
again
without
so
much
as
putting
its
web
foot
in
front
of
its
bill
which
dot
thought
very
rude
or
else
very
ancient
manners
little
human
it
said
tell
me
what
kind
of
bush
creatures
come
about
your
burrow
we
live
in
a
cottage
she
said
but
seeing
that
the
platypus
did
not
like
to
be
corrected
and
that
the
kangaroo
looked
quite
shocked
at
her
doing
so
she
hurriedly
described
the
creatures
she
had
seen
there
she
said
there
were
crickets
grasshoppers
mice
lizards
swallows
opossums
flying
foxes
kookooburras
magpies
and
companions
stop
interrupted
the
platypus
with
a
wave
of
its
web
foot
that
is
the
right
one
who
asked
the
kangaroo
and
dot
anxiously
together
the
bird
you
call
shepherd
companion
some
of
you
call
it
rickety
dick
or
willy
wagtail
turning
to
the
kangaroo
especially
it
continued
if
you
can
bring
yourself
to
speak
to
anything
so
obtrusive
and
gossiping
without
any
ancestry
or
manners
whatever
you
will
be
able
to
learn
all
you
need
from
that
bird
humans
and
wagtails
fraternise
together
they
both
i
knew
you
could
advise
me
said
the
kangaroo
gratefully
oh
platypus
how
clever
you
are
cried
dot
clapping
her
hands
directly
dot
had
spoken
she
saw
that
she
had
offended
the
queer
little
creature
before
her
it
raised
itself
with
an
air
of
offended
dignity
that
was
unmistakable
the
name
platypus
is
insulting
it
remarked
looking
at
the
child
severely
it
means
a
vulgar
pseudonym
which
could
only
have
emanated
from
the
brutally
coarse
expressions
of
a
human
my
name
is
ornithorhynchus
paradoxus
besides
even
if
my
front
feet
can
expand
they
can
also
contract
see
as
narrow
and
refined
as
a
bird
claw
observe
too
that
my
hind
feet
are
narrow
and
like
a
seal
fin
though
it
has
been
described
as
a
mole
foot
as
the
platypus
spoke
and
thrust
out
its
strangely
different
feet
the
kangaroo
edged
a
little
closer
to
dot
and
whispered
in
her
ear
getting
angry
and
is
beginning
to
use
long
words
do
be
careful
what
you
say
or
it
will
be
terrible
i
beg
your
pardon
said
dot
i
did
not
wish
to
hurt
your
feelings
para
pa
ra
dox
us
paradoxus
if
you
please
insisted
the
little
creature
how
would
you
like
it
if
your
name
was
and
i
called
you
one
jones
or
one
smith
and
did
not
say
both
the
jones
and
the
smiths
you
have
no
idea
how
sensitive
our
race
is
you
humans
have
no
feelings
at
all
compared
with
ours
why
my
fifth
pair
of
nerves
are
larger
than
a
man
humans
get
on
my
nerves
dreadfully
it
ended
in
disgusted
accents
she
did
not
mean
to
hurt
you
said
the
gentle
kangaroo
soothingly
is
there
anything
we
can
do
to
make
you
feel
comfortable
again
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
sighed
the
platypus
now
mournful
and
depressed
i
must
sing
only
music
can
quiet
my
nerves
i
will
sing
a
little
threnody
composed
by
myself
about
the
good
old
days
of
this
world
before
the
flood
and
as
it
spoke
the
platypus
moved
into
an
upright
position
amongst
the
tussock
grass
and
after
a
little
cough
opened
its
bill
to
sing
the
kangaroo
kept
very
close
to
dot
and
warned
her
to
be
very
attentive
to
the
song
and
not
to
interrupt
it
on
any
account
almost
before
the
kangaroo
had
ceased
to
whisper
in
her
ear
dot
heard
this
strange
song
sung
to
the
most
peculiar
tune
she
had
ever
heard
and
in
the
funniest
of
little
squeaky
voices
the
fairest
iguanodon
reposed
upon
the
shore
extended
lay
her
beauteous
form
a
hundred
feet
and
more
the
sun
with
rays
flammivomous
beat
on
the
sand
and
sportive
little
saurians
disported
on
the
strand
but
oft
the
iguanodon
reproved
them
in
their
glee
and
said
alas
this
saurian
age
is
not
what
it
should
be
then
forth
from
that
archaic
sea
the
ichthyosaurus
uprose
upon
his
finny
wings
with
neocomian
fuss
o
iguanodon
he
cried
as
he
approached
the
shore
why
art
thou
thus
dysthynic
love
come
rise
with
me
and
soar
or
leave
these
estuarian
seas
and
wander
in
the
grove
behold
a
reptile
fish
is
dying
for
thy
love
then
through
the
dark
coniferous
grove
they
wandered
side
by
side
the
tender
iguanodon
and
ichthyosaurian
bride
and
through
the
enubilious
air
the
carboniferous
breeze
awoke
with
amphibious
sighs
the
silence
in
the
trees
to
think
they
cried
when
ages
intervene
our
osseous
fossil
forms
will
be
in
some
museum
seen
bemoaning
thus
by
dumous
path
they
crushed
the
cycad
growth
and
many
a
crash
and
thunder
marked
the
progress
of
them
both
and
when
they
reached
the
estuary
the
excandescent
sun
was
setting
the
hefted
sea
their
saurian
day
was
done
then
raised
they
paraseline
eyes
unto
the
flaming
moon
and
wept
the
neocomian
age
was
passing
all
too
soon
o
iguanodon
o
earth
o
ichthyosaurus
o
melanocephalous
saurians
oh
oh
oh
here
the
platypus
was
sobbing
oh
troglyodites
obscure
oh
oh
at
this
point
of
the
song
the
poor
platypus
whose
voice
had
trembled
with
increasing
emotion
and
sobbing
in
each
verse
broke
down
overcome
by
the
extreme
sensitiveness
of
its
fifth
pair
of
nerves
and
the
sadness
of
its
song
and
wept
in
terrible
grief
the
gentle
kangaroo
was
also
deeply
moved
seeing
the
platypus
in
such
sorrow
and
dot
mastered
her
aversion
to
touching
cold
damp
fur
and
stroked
the
little
creature
head
the
platypus
seemed
much
soothed
by
their
sympathy
but
hurriedly
bid
them
farewell
it
said
it
must
try
and
restore
its
shattered
fifth
pair
of
nerves
by
a
few
hydrophilus
latipalpus
beetles
for
lunch
and
a
sleep
it
wearily
dragged
itself
down
to
the
edge
of
the
pool
and
looked
backwards
to
the
kangaroo
and
dot
who
called
out
to
it
its
eyes
were
dim
with
tears
for
it
was
still
thinking
of
the
iguanodon
and
ichthyosaurus
and
of
the
good
old
days
before
the
flood
it
breaks
my
heart
to
think
that
they
are
all
fossils
it
exclaimed
mournfully
shaking
its
head
fossils
it
repeated
as
it
plunged
into
the
pool
and
swam
away
fossils
it
cried
once
more
in
far
faint
accents
and
a
second
later
it
dived
out
of
sight
for
several
moments
after
the
platypus
had
disappeared
from
view
the
kangaroo
and
dot
remained
just
as
it
had
left
them
then
dot
broke
the
silence
dear
kangaroo
said
she
what
was
that
song
about
i
do
know
said
the
animal
wistfully
no
one
ever
knows
what
the
platypus
sings
about
it
was
very
sad
said
dot
dreadfully
sad
sighed
the
kangaroo
but
the
platypus
is
a
most
learned
and
interesting
creature
she
added
hastily
its
conversation
and
songs
are
most
edifying
everyone
in
the
bush
admits
it
does
anyone
understand
its
conversation
asked
dot
she
was
afraid
she
must
be
very
stupid
for
she
had
understood
anything
except
that
willy
wagtail
could
help
them
to
find
her
way
that
is
the
beauty
of
it
all
said
the
kangaroo
the
platypus
is
so
learned
and
so
instructive
that
no
one
tries
to
understand
it
it
is
not
expected
that
anyone
should
illustration
dot
dances
with
the
native
companions
chapter
v
now
we
must
find
willy
wagtail
said
the
kangaroo
the
chances
are
his
big
cousin
who
lives
in
the
bush
will
be
able
to
tell
us
where
to
find
him
for
he
does
care
for
the
bush
and
lives
almost
entirely
with
humans
and
the
queer
creatures
they
have
brought
into
the
country
we
may
have
to
go
a
long
way
so
hop
into
my
pouch
and
we
will
get
on
our
way
once
more
dot
was
in
the
kind
kangaroo
pouch
it
was
in
the
latter
end
of
autumn
and
the
air
was
so
keen
that
as
her
torn
little
frock
was
now
very
little
protection
to
her
against
the
cold
she
was
glad
to
be
back
in
that
nice
fur
bag
she
was
used
now
to
the
springy
bounding
of
the
great
kangaroo
and
felt
quite
safe
so
that
she
quite
enjoyed
the
wonderful
and
seemingly
dangerous
things
the
animal
did
in
its
great
leaps
and
jumps
with
many
rests
and
stops
to
eat
berries
or
grass
on
their
way
they
searched
the
bush
for
the
rest
of
the
day
without
finding
the
big
bush
wagtail
all
kinds
of
creatures
had
seen
him
or
heard
his
strange
rattling
chattering
song
but
it
always
seemed
that
he
had
just
flown
off
a
few
minutes
before
they
heard
of
him
it
was
most
vexatious
and
dot
saw
that
another
night
must
pass
before
they
would
be
able
to
hear
of
her
home
she
did
not
like
to
think
of
that
for
she
could
picture
to
herself
all
those
great
men
on
their
big
rough
horses
coming
back
to
her
father
cottage
that
night
and
how
they
would
begin
to
be
quiet
and
sad
she
thought
it
would
not
be
half
so
bad
to
be
lost
if
the
people
at
home
could
only
know
that
one
was
safe
and
snug
in
a
kind
pouch
but
she
knew
that
her
parents
could
never
suppose
that
she
was
so
well
cared
for
and
would
only
think
that
she
was
dying
alone
in
the
terrible
bush
dying
for
want
of
food
and
water
and
from
fear
and
exposure
how
strange
it
seemed
that
people
should
die
like
that
in
the
bush
where
so
many
creatures
lived
well
and
happily
but
then
they
had
not
bush
friends
to
tell
them
what
berries
and
roots
to
eat
and
where
to
get
water
and
to
cuddle
them
up
in
a
nice
warm
fur
during
the
cold
night
as
she
thought
of
this
she
rubbed
her
face
against
the
soft
coat
and
patted
her
with
her
little
hands
and
the
affectionate
animal
was
so
pleased
at
these
caresses
that
she
jumped
clean
over
a
watercourse
twenty
feet
at
least
in
one
bound
it
was
getting
evening
time
and
the
sun
was
setting
with
a
beautiful
rosy
colour
as
they
came
upon
a
lovely
scene
they
had
followed
the
watercourse
until
it
widened
out
into
a
great
shallow
creek
beside
a
grassy
plain
as
they
emerged
from
the
last
scattered
bushes
and
trees
of
the
forest
and
hopped
out
into
the
open
side
of
a
range
of
hills
miles
and
miles
of
grass
country
with
dim
distant
hills
stretched
before
them
the
great
shining
surface
of
the
creek
caught
the
rosy
evening
light
and
every
pink
cloudlet
in
the
sky
looked
doubly
beautiful
reflected
in
the
water
here
and
there
out
of
the
water
arose
giant
skeleton
trees
with
huge
silver
trunks
and
contorted
dead
branches
on
these
twisted
limbs
were
numbers
of
birds
shag
blue
and
white
cranes
and
black
and
white
ibis
with
their
bent
bills
slowly
paddling
on
the
creek
with
graceful
movements
were
twenty
or
thirty
black
swans
and
in
and
out
of
their
ranks
as
they
passed
in
stately
procession
shot
wild
ducks
and
moor
hens
like
a
flotilla
of
little
boats
amongst
a
fleet
of
big
ships
all
these
birds
were
watching
a
pretty
sight
that
arrested
dot
attention
at
once
by
the
margin
of
the
creek
where
tufted
rushes
and
tall
sedges
shed
their
graceful
reflection
on
the
pink
waters
were
a
party
of
native
companions
dancing
in
these
times
it
is
seldom
we
can
see
a
sight
like
this
said
the
kangaroo
the
water
is
generally
too
unsafe
for
the
birds
to
enjoy
themselves
it
often
means
death
to
them
to
have
a
little
pleasure
as
the
kangaroo
spoke
one
of
the
native
companions
caught
sight
of
her
and
leaving
the
dance
opened
her
wings
and
still
making
dainty
steps
with
her
long
legs
half
danced
and
half
flew
to
where
the
kangaroo
was
sitting
good
evening
kangaroo
she
said
gracefully
bowing
will
you
not
come
a
little
nearer
to
see
the
dance
then
the
native
companion
saw
dot
in
the
kangaroo
pouch
and
made
a
little
spring
of
surprise
dear
me
she
said
what
have
you
in
your
pouch
it
a
human
said
the
kangaroo
apologetically
it
quite
a
little
harmless
one
let
me
introduce
you
so
dot
alighted
from
the
pouch
and
joined
in
the
conversation
and
the
native
companion
was
much
interested
in
hearing
her
story
do
you
dance
asked
the
native
companion
with
a
quick
turn
of
her
head
on
its
long
graceful
neck
dot
said
that
she
loved
dancing
so
the
native
companion
took
her
down
to
the
creek
and
all
the
other
companions
stopped
dancing
and
gathered
round
her
whilst
she
was
introduced
and
her
story
told
then
they
spread
their
wings
and
with
stately
steps
escorted
her
to
the
edge
of
the
water
whilst
the
kangaroo
sat
a
little
way
off
and
delightedly
watched
the
proceedings
dot
did
understand
any
of
the
figures
of
the
dance
but
the
scenery
was
so
lovely
and
so
was
the
pink
sunset
and
the
native
companions
were
so
elegant
and
gay
that
catching
up
her
ragged
little
skirts
in
both
hands
she
followed
their
movements
with
her
bare
brown
feet
as
best
she
could
and
enjoyed
herself
very
much
to
dot
the
eight
birds
that
took
part
in
the
entertainment
were
very
tall
and
splendid
with
their
lovely
grey
plumage
and
greeny
heads
and
she
felt
quite
small
as
they
gathered
round
her
sometimes
and
enclosed
her
within
their
outspread
wings
and
how
beautiful
their
dancing
was
how
light
their
dainty
steps
as
their
feet
scarcely
touched
the
earth
and
what
fantastic
measures
they
danced
advancing
retreating
circling
round
with
their
beautiful
wings
keeping
the
rhythm
of
their
feet
there
was
one
figure
that
dot
thought
the
prettiest
of
all
when
they
danced
in
line
at
the
margin
of
the
water
stepping
and
bowing
and
gracefully
gyrating
to
their
shadows
which
were
reflected
with
the
pink
clouds
of
evening
on
the
surface
of
the
creek
dot
was
very
sorry
and
hot
and
breathless
when
the
dance
came
to
an
end
the
sun
had
been
gone
a
long
time
and
all
the
pink
shades
had
slowly
turned
to
grey
the
creek
had
lost
its
radiant
colour
and
looked
like
a
silver
mirror
and
so
desolate
and
sombre
that
no
one
could
have
imagined
it
to
have
been
the
scene
of
so
much
gaiety
shortly
before
dot
hastily
returned
to
the
kangaroo
and
all
the
native
companions
came
daintily
and
made
graceful
adieus
to
them
both
afterwards
they
spread
their
great
soft
wings
and
stretching
their
long
legs
behind
them
wheeled
upwards
to
the
darkening
sky
then
all
the
birds
in
the
bare
trees
preened
their
feathers
and
settled
down
for
the
night
and
the
kangaroo
took
her
little
human
charge
back
to
the
bush
where
there
was
a
cosy
sheltering
rock
under
which
to
pass
the
night
and
they
lay
down
together
with
the
stars
peeping
at
them
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
they
had
slept
for
a
long
time
as
it
seemed
to
dot
when
they
were
awakened
by
a
little
voice
saying
wake
up
kangaroo
you
are
in
danger
get
away
as
soon
as
possible
the
moon
was
shining
fitfully
as
it
broke
through
swift
flying
clouds
in
the
uncertain
light
dot
could
see
a
little
creature
near
them
and
knew
at
once
that
it
was
an
opossum
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
kangaroo
softly
blacks
said
the
opossum
and
as
it
spoke
dot
heard
a
sound
as
of
a
half
dingo
dog
howling
and
snapping
in
the
distance
as
that
sound
was
heard
the
opossum
made
one
flying
leap
to
the
nearest
tree
and
scrambled
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
i
wish
he
had
told
us
a
little
more
said
the
kangaroo
still
for
a
it
was
a
act
to
wake
me
up
they
are
selfish
spiteful
little
beasts
as
a
rule
now
i
wonder
where
those
blacks
are
i
shall
have
to
go
a
little
way
to
sniff
and
listen
i
wo
go
far
so
do
be
afraid
but
stay
quietly
here
until
i
come
back
chapter
vi
it
was
terrible
to
dot
to
see
the
kangaroo
hop
off
into
the
dark
bush
and
to
find
herself
all
alone
so
she
crawled
out
from
under
the
ledge
of
rock
into
the
moonlight
and
sat
on
a
stone
where
she
could
see
the
sky
and
watch
the
black
ragged
clouds
hurry
over
the
moon
but
the
bush
was
not
altogether
quiet
she
could
hear
an
owl
hooting
at
the
moon
not
far
off
was
a
camp
of
quarrelsome
flying
foxes
and
the
melancholy
nightjar
in
the
distance
was
fulfilling
its
mission
of
making
all
the
bush
creatures
miserable
with
its
incessant
mournful
as
dot
could
understand
all
the
voices
it
amused
her
to
listen
to
the
wrangles
of
the
flying
foxes
as
they
ate
the
fruit
of
a
wild
fig
tree
near
by
she
saw
them
swoop
past
on
their
huge
black
wings
with
a
solemn
flapping
then
as
each
little
fox
approached
the
tree
the
foxes
who
were
there
already
screamed
and
swore
in
dreadfully
bad
language
at
the
visitor
for
every
little
fox
on
the
tree
was
afraid
some
other
flying
fox
would
eat
all
the
figs
and
as
each
visitor
arrived
he
was
assailed
with
cries
of
get
away
you
not
wanted
here
this
is
my
branch
my
figs
go
and
find
figs
for
yourself
these
figs
are
not
half
ripe
like
the
juicy
ones
on
the
other
side
of
the
tree
then
the
flying
fox
with
a
spiteful
squeal
would
pounce
down
on
a
branch
already
occupied
and
angry
spluttering
and
screams
would
arise
followed
by
a
heavy
fall
of
fighting
foxes
tumbling
with
a
crash
through
the
trees
then
out
into
the
open
sky
swept
dozens
of
black
wings
accompanied
by
abusive
swearing
from
dozens
of
wicked
little
brown
foxes
and
as
they
settled
again
on
the
tree
all
the
fighting
would
begin
again
so
that
the
squealing
screaming
and
swearing
never
ended
as
dot
was
listening
to
the
fighting
of
the
flying
foxes
she
heard
a
sound
near
her
that
alarmed
her
greatly
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
the
noise
was
like
it
might
have
been
the
braying
of
a
donkey
mixed
up
with
the
clattering
of
palings
tumbled
together
and
with
grunts
and
snorts
dot
started
to
her
feet
in
fright
and
would
have
run
away
only
she
was
afraid
of
being
lost
worse
than
ever
so
she
stood
still
and
looked
round
for
the
terrible
monster
that
could
make
such
extraordinary
sounds
the
grunts
and
clattering
stopped
and
the
noise
died
away
in
a
long
doleful
bray
but
she
could
not
see
where
it
came
from
having
peered
into
the
dark
shadows
dot
went
more
into
the
open
and
sat
with
her
back
to
a
fallen
tree
keeping
an
anxious
watch
all
round
perhaps
it
is
the
blacks
what
would
they
do
with
me
if
they
found
me
what
will
happen
if
they
have
killed
my
dear
kangaroo
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
as
this
terrible
thought
came
into
her
head
soon
she
heard
something
coming
towards
her
stealthily
and
slowly
she
would
not
look
up
she
was
so
frightened
she
was
sure
it
was
some
black
man
with
his
spear
about
to
kill
her
she
shut
her
eyes
closer
and
held
her
breath
perhaps
she
thought
he
will
not
see
me
then
a
cold
shiver
went
through
her
little
body
as
she
felt
something
claw
hold
of
her
hair
and
she
thought
she
was
about
to
be
killed
she
kept
her
eyes
shut
and
the
clawing
went
on
and
then
to
her
astonishment
she
heard
an
animal
voice
say
in
wondering
tones
why
it
fur
how
funny
it
looked
in
the
moonlight
then
dot
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
and
looked
round
and
saw
a
funny
native
bear
on
the
tree
trunk
behind
her
he
was
quite
clearly
to
be
seen
in
the
moonlight
his
thick
grey
fur
that
looked
as
if
he
was
wrapped
up
to
keep
out
the
most
terrible
cold
weather
his
short
stumpy
big
legs
and
little
sharp
face
with
big
bushy
ears
could
be
seen
as
distinctly
as
in
daylight
dot
had
never
seen
one
so
near
before
and
she
loved
it
at
once
it
looked
so
innocent
and
kind
you
dear
little
native
bear
she
exclaimed
at
once
stroking
its
head
am
i
a
native
bear
asked
the
animal
in
a
meek
voice
i
never
heard
that
before
i
thought
i
was
a
koala
i
always
been
told
so
but
of
course
one
never
knows
oneself
what
are
you
do
you
know
i
a
little
girl
replied
dot
proudly
the
koala
saw
that
dot
was
proud
but
as
it
did
see
any
reason
why
she
should
be
it
was
not
a
bit
afraid
of
her
i
never
heard
of
one
or
saw
one
before
it
said
simply
do
you
burrow
or
live
in
a
tree
i
live
at
home
said
dot
but
wishing
to
be
quite
correct
she
added
that
is
when
i
am
there
then
where
are
you
now
asked
the
koala
rather
perplexed
i
not
at
home
replied
dot
not
knowing
how
to
make
her
position
clear
to
the
little
animal
then
you
live
where
you
do
live
said
the
koala
where
is
it
and
the
little
bear
looked
quite
unhappy
in
its
attempt
to
understand
what
dot
meant
i
lost
it
said
dot
i
do
know
where
it
is
you
make
my
head
feel
empty
said
the
koala
sadly
i
live
in
the
gum
tree
over
there
do
you
eat
gum
leaves
no
when
i
at
home
i
have
milk
and
bread
and
eggs
and
meat
dear
me
said
the
koala
they
all
new
to
one
is
it
far
i
should
like
to
see
the
trees
they
grow
on
please
show
me
the
way
but
i
ca
said
dot
they
do
grow
on
trees
and
i
do
know
my
way
home
it
lost
you
see
i
do
see
said
the
native
bear
i
never
can
see
far
at
night
and
not
at
all
in
daylight
that
is
why
i
came
here
i
saw
your
fur
shining
in
the
moonlight
and
i
could
make
out
what
it
was
so
i
came
to
see
if
there
is
anything
new
to
be
seen
i
must
get
a
near
view
of
it
i
do
feel
happy
if
i
do
know
all
about
it
are
you
cold
yes
i
am
a
little
since
my
kangaroo
left
me
dot
said
now
you
make
my
head
feel
empty
again
said
the
koala
plaintively
what
has
a
kangaroo
got
to
do
with
your
feeling
cold
what
have
you
done
with
your
fur
i
never
had
any
said
dot
only
these
curls
and
she
touched
her
little
head
then
you
ought
to
be
black
argued
the
koala
you
not
the
right
colour
only
blacks
have
no
fur
but
what
they
steal
from
the
proper
owners
do
you
steal
fur
it
asked
in
an
anxious
voice
how
do
they
steal
fur
asked
dot
the
koala
looked
very
miserable
and
spoke
with
horror
they
kill
us
with
spears
and
tear
off
our
skins
and
wear
them
because
their
own
skins
are
no
good
that
not
stealing
said
dot
that
killing
and
although
it
seemed
very
difficult
to
make
the
little
bear
understand
she
explained
stealing
is
taking
away
another
person
things
and
when
a
person
is
dead
he
has
anything
belonging
to
him
so
it
not
stealing
to
take
what
belonged
to
him
before
because
it
is
his
any
longer
that
is
if
it
does
belong
to
anyone
else
you
make
my
head
feel
empty
complained
the
koala
i
sure
all
wrong
for
an
animal
skin
and
fur
is
his
own
and
it
his
business
to
keep
it
whole
everyone
in
the
bush
is
trying
to
keep
his
skin
whole
all
day
long
and
all
night
too
good
gracious
what
is
the
matter
up
there
a
terrible
hullabaloo
between
a
pair
of
opossums
up
a
neighbouring
gum
tree
arrested
the
attention
of
both
dot
and
the
koala
presently
the
sounds
of
snarling
spitting
and
screaming
ended
and
an
opossum
climbed
out
to
the
far
end
of
a
branch
where
the
moonlight
shone
on
his
grey
fur
like
silver
there
he
remained
snapping
and
barking
disagreeable
things
to
his
mate
who
climbed
up
to
the
topmost
branch
and
snarled
and
growled
back
equally
unpleasant
remarks
why
do
you
bring
in
gum
leaves
for
instead
of
sleeping
all
day
and
half
the
night
too
shouted
the
opossum
on
the
branch
to
his
wife
you
know
i
get
hungry
before
daylight
is
over
and
hate
going
out
in
the
light
get
them
yourself
you
lazy
loon
retorted
the
lady
opossum
if
you
disturb
my
dreams
again
this
way
i
make
your
fur
fly
take
care
barked
back
her
husband
or
i
bring
you
off
that
branch
pretty
quickly
you
better
try
sneered
his
wife
remember
how
i
landed
you
into
the
billabong
the
other
night
the
taunt
was
too
much
for
the
opossum
on
the
branch
he
scuttled
up
the
tree
to
reach
his
mate
who
sprang
forward
from
her
perch
into
the
air
dot
saw
her
spring
with
her
legs
all
spread
out
so
that
the
skinny
flaps
were
like
furry
wings
by
this
means
she
was
able
to
break
her
fall
and
softly
alighting
on
the
earth
a
moment
after
she
had
scrambled
up
another
tree
followed
by
her
mate
from
tree
to
tree
from
branch
to
branch
they
fled
or
pursued
one
another
with
growls
screams
and
splutters
until
they
disappeared
from
sight
how
unhappy
those
poor
opossums
must
be
living
in
the
same
tree
said
dot
why
do
they
live
in
different
trees
they
would
be
happy
observed
the
koala
they
are
so
fond
of
one
another
then
why
do
they
quarrel
asked
dot
because
they
live
in
the
same
tree
of
course
said
the
koala
if
they
lived
in
different
trees
and
never
quarrelled
they
would
like
it
at
all
they
find
life
dull
and
they
get
sulky
there
nothing
worse
than
a
sulky
they
are
champions
at
that
they
make
a
dreadful
noise
with
their
quarrelling
said
dot
they
are
nearly
as
bad
as
the
flying
foxes
over
there
i
wonder
if
they
made
that
fearful
sound
i
heard
just
before
you
came
illustration
dot
the
native
bear
and
the
opossum
i
expect
what
you
heard
was
from
me
said
the
koala
i
had
just
awakened
and
when
i
saw
the
moon
was
up
i
felt
pleased
was
all
that
sound
and
many
noises
yours
asked
dot
with
astonishment
as
she
regarded
the
shaggy
little
animal
on
the
tree
trunk
the
koala
smiled
modestly
yes
it
said
when
i
pleased
there
is
no
creature
in
the
bush
can
make
such
a
noise
or
so
many
different
noises
at
once
i
waken
everyone
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
round
you
think
it
to
see
me
as
i
am
would
you
the
koala
was
evidently
very
pleased
with
this
accomplishment
it
is
kind
of
you
to
wake
up
all
the
sleeping
creatures
said
dot
why
not
asked
the
koala
you
are
a
night
creature
i
suppose
or
you
would
be
awake
now
well
do
you
think
it
unfair
the
way
everything
is
arranged
for
the
day
creatures
but
then
said
dot
there
are
so
many
more
day
creatures
that
does
make
any
difference
observed
the
koala
but
it
does
said
dot
how
asked
the
native
bear
because
if
you
had
the
day
it
would
be
any
good
to
you
and
if
they
had
the
night
it
would
be
any
good
to
them
so
your
night
could
be
their
day
and
their
day
could
be
your
night
you
make
my
head
feel
empty
said
the
koala
but
you
think
differently
if
a
flock
of
kookooburras
settled
on
your
tree
and
guffawed
idiotically
when
you
wanted
to
sleep
as
you
do
like
being
waked
yourself
why
do
you
wake
others
then
asked
dot
because
this
is
a
free
country
said
the
koala
while
dot
was
trying
to
understand
why
the
koala
reason
should
suffice
for
one
animal
making
another
life
uncomfortable
she
was
rejoiced
to
see
the
kangaroo
bound
into
sight
she
forgot
all
about
the
koala
and
rushed
forward
to
meet
it
chapter
vii
i
so
glad
you
come
back
she
exclaimed
the
kangaroo
was
a
little
breathless
and
excited
we
are
not
in
danger
at
present
she
said
but
one
never
knows
when
one
will
be
so
we
must
move
and
that
will
be
more
dangerous
than
staying
where
we
are
then
let
us
stay
said
dot
that
wo
do
replied
the
kangaroo
this
is
the
conclusion
i
have
jumped
to
if
we
stay
here
the
blacks
might
come
this
way
and
their
dingo
dogs
hunt
us
to
death
to
get
to
a
safe
place
we
must
pass
their
camp
that
is
a
little
risky
but
we
must
go
that
way
we
can
do
this
easily
if
the
dogs
do
get
scent
of
us
as
all
the
blacks
are
prancing
about
and
making
a
noise
having
a
kind
of
game
in
fact
and
they
are
so
amused
that
we
ought
to
get
past
quite
safely
i
done
it
many
times
before
at
night
dot
looked
round
to
say
to
the
koala
but
the
little
animal
had
heard
the
kangaroo
speak
of
blacks
and
that
word
suggested
to
its
empty
little
head
that
it
must
keep
its
skin
whole
so
without
waiting
to
be
polite
to
dot
it
had
sneaked
up
its
gum
tree
and
was
well
out
of
sight
without
wasting
time
dot
settled
in
the
kangaroo
pouch
and
they
started
upon
their
perilous
way
for
some
distance
the
kangaroo
hopped
along
boldly
with
an
occasional
warning
to
dot
to
shut
her
eyes
as
they
plunged
through
the
bushes
but
after
crossing
a
watercourse
and
climbing
a
stiff
hill
she
whispered
that
they
must
both
keep
quite
silent
and
told
dot
to
listen
as
she
stopped
for
a
moment
dot
could
hear
to
their
right
a
murmuring
of
voices
and
a
steady
beating
sound
their
camp
is
over
there
said
the
kangaroo
that
is
the
sound
of
their
game
ca
we
go
some
other
way
asked
dot
no
answered
the
kangaroo
because
past
that
place
we
can
reach
some
very
wild
country
where
it
would
be
hard
for
them
to
pursue
us
we
shall
have
to
pass
quite
close
to
their
playground
so
in
perfect
silence
they
went
on
illustration
the
corroboree
the
kangaroo
seemed
to
dot
to
approach
the
whereabouts
of
the
blackfellows
as
cautiously
as
when
they
had
visited
the
the
first
night
dot
little
heart
beat
fast
as
the
sound
of
the
corroboree
became
clearer
and
clearer
and
they
neared
the
scene
of
the
dance
soon
she
could
hear
the
stamping
of
feet
the
beating
of
weapons
together
and
the
wild
chanting
and
sometimes
there
were
the
whimpering
of
dogs
and
the
cry
of
children
at
the
camp
a
little
distance
from
the
corroboree
ground
the
kangaroo
showed
no
signs
of
fear
at
the
increasing
noise
of
the
blacks
but
every
sound
of
a
dog
caused
it
to
stop
and
twist
about
its
big
ears
and
sensitive
nose
as
it
sniffed
and
listened
soon
dot
could
see
a
great
red
glare
of
firelight
through
the
trees
ahead
of
their
track
and
she
knew
that
in
that
place
the
tribe
of
black
men
were
having
a
festive
dance
if
they
had
gone
on
their
way
it
is
possible
that
they
would
have
slipped
past
the
blacks
without
danger
but
although
the
kangaroo
is
as
timid
an
animal
as
any
in
the
bush
it
is
also
very
curious
and
kangaroo
wished
to
peep
at
the
corroboree
she
whispered
to
dot
that
it
would
be
nice
for
a
little
human
to
see
some
other
humans
after
being
so
long
amongst
bush
creatures
and
said
also
that
there
would
be
no
great
danger
in
hopping
to
a
rock
that
would
command
a
view
of
the
open
ground
where
the
corroboree
was
being
held
of
course
dot
thought
this
would
be
great
fun
so
the
kangaroo
took
her
to
the
rock
where
they
peeped
through
the
trees
and
saw
before
them
the
weird
scene
and
dance
dot
nearly
screamed
with
fright
at
the
sight
she
had
thought
she
would
see
a
few
black
folk
not
a
crowd
of
such
terrible
people
as
she
beheld
they
did
not
look
like
human
beings
at
all
but
like
dreadful
demons
they
were
so
wicked
and
ugly
in
appearance
the
men
who
were
dancing
were
without
clothes
but
their
black
bodies
were
painted
with
red
and
white
stripes
and
bits
of
down
and
feathers
were
stuck
on
their
skin
some
had
only
white
stripes
over
the
places
where
their
bones
were
which
made
them
look
like
skeletons
flitting
before
the
fire
or
in
and
out
of
the
surrounding
darkness
the
dancing
men
were
divided
from
the
rest
of
the
tribe
by
a
row
of
fires
which
burning
brightly
lit
the
horrid
scene
with
a
lurid
red
light
the
firelight
seemed
to
make
the
ferocious
faces
of
the
tribe
still
more
hideous
the
tribe
people
were
squatting
in
rows
on
the
ground
beating
boomerangs
and
spears
together
or
striking
bags
of
skin
with
sticks
to
make
an
accompaniment
to
the
wailing
song
they
sang
sometimes
the
women
would
cease
beating
the
skin
bags
to
clap
their
hands
and
strike
their
sides
yelling
the
words
of
the
corroboree
song
as
the
painted
figures
like
fiends
and
skeletons
danced
before
the
row
of
fires
it
was
a
terrifying
sight
to
dot
oh
kangaroo
she
whispered
they
are
dreadful
horrid
creatures
they
just
humans
replied
the
kangaroo
indulgently
but
white
humans
are
not
like
that
said
dot
all
humans
are
the
same
underneath
they
all
kill
kangaroos
said
the
kangaroo
look
there
they
are
playing
at
killing
us
in
their
dance
dot
looked
once
more
at
the
hideous
figures
as
they
left
the
fire
and
began
acting
like
actors
one
of
the
blackfellows
had
come
from
a
little
bower
of
trees
and
wore
a
few
skins
so
arranged
as
to
make
him
look
as
much
like
a
kangaroo
as
possible
whilst
he
worked
a
stick
which
he
pretended
was
a
kangaroo
tail
and
hopped
about
the
other
painted
savages
were
creeping
in
and
out
of
the
bushes
with
their
spears
and
boomerangs
as
if
they
were
hunting
and
the
kangaroo
made
believe
not
to
see
them
but
stooped
down
nibbling
grass
what
an
idea
of
a
kangaroo
sniffed
dot
friend
why
a
real
kangaroo
would
have
smelt
or
heard
those
humans
and
have
bounded
away
far
out
of
sight
by
now
but
it
all
sham
said
dot
the
black
man
could
be
a
real
kangaroo
then
it
just
shows
how
stupid
humans
are
to
try
and
be
one
said
her
friend
humans
think
themselves
so
clever
she
continued
but
just
see
what
bad
kangaroos
they
make
such
a
simple
thing
to
do
too
but
their
legs
bend
the
wrong
way
for
jumping
and
that
stick
is
any
good
for
a
tail
and
it
has
to
be
worked
with
those
big
clumsy
arms
just
see
too
how
those
skins
fit
why
it
enough
to
make
a
sides
split
with
laughter
to
see
such
foolery
dot
friend
peeped
at
the
black
acting
with
the
contempt
to
be
expected
of
a
real
kangaroo
who
saw
human
beings
pretending
to
be
one
of
those
noble
animals
dot
thought
the
kangaroo
had
never
looked
so
grand
before
she
was
so
tall
so
big
and
yet
so
graceful
a
really
beautiful
creature
well
that
over
remarked
the
kangaroo
as
one
of
the
blacks
pretended
to
spear
the
blackfellow
and
all
the
rest
began
to
dance
around
whilst
the
sham
kangaroo
made
believe
to
be
dead
well
i
forgive
their
killing
such
a
silly
creature
there
was
a
jump
in
it
after
more
dancing
to
the
singing
and
noise
of
the
a
blackfellow
came
from
the
little
bower
in
the
dim
background
with
a
battered
straw
hat
on
and
a
few
rags
tied
round
his
neck
and
wrist
in
imitation
of
a
collar
and
cuffs
the
fellow
tried
to
act
the
part
of
a
white
man
although
he
had
no
more
clothes
on
than
the
old
hat
and
rags
but
after
a
great
deal
of
dancing
he
strutted
about
pulled
up
the
rag
collar
made
a
great
fuss
with
his
rag
cuffs
and
kept
taking
off
his
old
straw
hat
to
the
other
blackfellows
and
to
the
rest
of
the
tribe
who
kept
up
the
noise
on
the
other
side
of
the
fires
now
this
is
better
said
the
kangaroo
with
a
smile
it
very
silly
but
willy
wagtail
says
that
is
just
the
way
humans
go
on
in
the
town
black
humans
can
act
being
white
humans
but
they
are
of
no
good
as
kangaroos
dot
thought
that
if
men
behaved
like
that
in
towns
it
must
be
very
strange
she
had
not
seen
any
like
the
acting
blackfellow
at
her
cottage
home
but
she
did
not
say
anything
for
it
was
quite
clear
in
her
little
mind
that
blackfellows
kangaroos
and
willy
wagtails
had
a
very
poor
opinion
of
white
people
she
felt
that
they
must
all
be
wrong
but
all
the
same
she
sometimes
wished
she
could
be
a
noble
kangaroo
and
not
a
despised
human
being
i
wish
i
were
not
a
little
white
girl
she
whispered
to
the
kangaroo
the
gentle
animal
patted
her
kindly
with
her
delicate
black
hands
you
are
as
nice
now
as
my
baby
kangaroo
she
said
sadly
but
you
will
have
to
grow
into
a
real
white
human
for
some
reason
there
have
to
be
all
sorts
of
creatures
on
the
earth
there
are
hawks
snakes
dingoes
and
humans
and
no
one
can
tell
for
what
good
they
exist
they
must
have
dropped
on
to
this
world
by
mistake
for
another
where
there
could
only
have
been
themselves
after
all
said
the
kind
animal
it
would
do
for
every
one
to
be
a
kangaroo
for
i
doubt
if
there
would
be
enough
grass
but
you
may
become
an
improved
human
how
could
i
be
that
asked
dot
eagerly
never
wear
kangaroo
leather
boots
never
use
kangaroo
skin
rugs
and
here
it
hesitated
a
little
as
though
the
subject
were
a
most
unpleasant
one
to
mention
never
do
what
enquired
dot
anxious
to
know
all
that
she
should
do
so
as
to
be
improved
never
never
eat
soup
said
the
kangaroo
solemnly
i
never
will
said
dot
earnestly
i
will
be
an
improved
human
this
conversation
had
been
so
serious
to
both
dot
and
the
kangaroo
that
they
had
quite
forgotten
the
perilousness
of
their
position
perhaps
this
was
because
the
kangaroo
can
not
think
but
it
quickly
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
in
danger
whilst
they
had
been
peeping
at
the
corroboree
and
talking
the
dingo
dogs
that
had
been
prowling
around
the
camp
had
caught
scent
of
the
kangaroo
and
following
the
trail
had
set
up
an
angry
snapping
and
howling
the
instant
this
sound
was
heard
by
the
kangaroo
she
made
an
immense
bound
and
as
she
seemed
to
fly
through
the
bush
dot
could
hear
the
sounds
of
the
corroboree
give
place
to
a
noise
of
shouting
and
disorder
the
dingo
dogs
and
the
blacks
were
all
in
pursuit
and
dot
kangaroo
with
little
dot
in
her
pouch
was
leaping
and
bounding
at
a
terrific
pace
to
save
both
their
lives
chapter
viii
it
was
fortunate
that
the
kangaroo
could
not
think
of
all
that
might
befall
them
or
she
never
could
have
had
the
courage
for
the
wonderful
feats
of
jumping
she
performed
poor
little
dot
whose
busy
brain
pictured
all
kinds
of
terrible
fates
was
so
overcome
with
fear
that
she
seemed
hardly
to
know
what
had
happened
and
the
more
she
thought
the
more
terrified
she
became
the
kangaroo
did
not
attempt
to
continue
the
upward
ascent
but
followed
a
slope
of
the
rugged
hill
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
this
was
better
than
trying
to
escape
where
the
trees
and
shrubs
would
have
prevented
her
making
those
astonishing
bounds
but
the
clouds
had
left
the
moon
clear
for
a
while
so
that
the
blackfellows
and
the
dogs
easily
followed
every
movement
as
they
pursued
the
hunt
on
a
smoother
level
below
the
blacks
were
trying
to
hurry
on
so
as
to
cut
off
the
kangaroo
retreat
at
a
spur
of
the
hill
where
to
get
away
she
would
have
to
leave
the
rocks
and
descend
towards
them
in
the
meantime
dot
ears
were
filled
with
the
sounds
of
snarling
snaps
from
the
dingo
dogs
and
hideous
noises
from
the
blacks
encouraging
the
animals
to
attack
the
kangaroo
but
what
pained
her
most
were
the
gasps
and
little
moans
of
her
good
friend
as
she
put
such
tremendous
power
into
every
leap
she
made
for
their
lives
crashing
through
twigs
and
scattering
stones
and
pebbles
in
the
wild
speed
of
their
flight
then
dot
busy
little
brain
told
her
another
thing
which
made
her
more
miserable
it
was
becoming
quite
clear
that
the
poor
kangaroo
was
getting
rapidly
exhausted
owing
to
her
having
to
bear
dot
weight
her
panting
became
more
and
more
distressing
and
so
did
her
sad
moans
and
flecks
of
foam
from
her
straining
lips
fell
on
dot
face
and
hands
dot
knew
that
her
kangaroo
was
trying
to
save
her
at
the
risk
of
her
own
life
without
the
little
girl
in
her
pouch
she
might
get
away
safely
but
with
her
to
carry
they
would
both
probably
fall
victims
to
the
fierce
blacks
and
their
dogs
kangaroo
kangaroo
she
cried
put
me
down
drop
dot
anywhere
anywhere
but
do
get
killed
yourself
but
all
dot
heard
was
a
little
hissing
sound
from
the
brave
animal
which
sounded
like
never
again
you
will
be
killed
moaned
dot
together
said
the
little
hissing
voice
as
another
great
bound
brought
them
to
the
spur
of
the
hill
and
then
the
kangaroo
had
to
pause
in
that
moment
dot
seemed
to
hear
and
see
everything
they
were
perched
on
a
rock
and
the
moonlight
lit
all
their
surroundings
like
day
to
the
right
was
a
deep
black
chasm
with
a
white
foaming
waterfall
pouring
into
the
darkness
below
in
front
was
the
same
wide
chasm
only
less
wide
and
beyond
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
yawning
cleft
in
the
earth
was
a
wild
spread
of
morass
country
a
gloomy
place
to
the
left
was
a
steep
slope
of
small
rocks
and
stones
leading
downwards
to
the
hollow
of
sedgy
land
that
fringed
the
cliffs
of
the
chasm
the
only
retreat
possible
was
to
pass
down
this
declivity
and
try
to
escape
by
the
sedgy
land
and
this
is
what
the
black
huntsmen
had
expected
it
was
a
very
weird
and
desolate
place
and
everything
looked
dark
and
dismal
under
the
moonlight
as
it
streamed
between
stormy
black
clouds
in
that
light
dot
could
see
the
blacks
hurrying
forward
already
one
of
the
dogs
had
far
outrun
the
others
and
with
wolfish
gait
and
savage
sounds
was
pressing
towards
their
place
of
observation
the
panting
trembling
kangaroo
saw
the
approaching
dog
also
and
leaped
down
from
the
crag
as
she
dropped
to
earth
she
stooped
and
quickly
lifted
dot
out
of
her
pouch
and
almost
before
dot
could
realize
the
movement
she
found
herself
standing
alone
whilst
the
kangaroo
hopped
forward
to
the
front
of
a
big
boulder
as
if
to
meet
the
dog
here
the
poor
hunted
creature
took
her
stand
with
her
back
close
to
the
rock
gentle
and
timid
as
she
was
and
unfitted
by
nature
to
fight
for
her
life
against
fierce
odds
it
was
brave
indeed
of
the
poor
kangaroo
to
face
her
enemies
prepared
to
do
battle
for
the
lives
of
little
dot
and
herself
so
noble
did
dot
kangaroo
look
in
that
desperate
moment
standing
erect
waiting
for
her
foe
and
conquering
her
naturally
frightened
nature
by
a
grand
effort
of
courage
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
either
dogs
or
men
should
be
so
cruel
as
to
take
her
life
for
a
moment
the
dingo
hound
seemed
daunted
by
her
bravery
and
paused
a
little
way
off
panting
with
its
great
tongue
lolling
out
of
its
mouth
dot
could
see
its
sharp
wicked
teeth
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
for
a
few
seconds
it
hesitated
to
make
the
attack
and
looked
back
down
the
slope
to
see
if
the
other
dogs
were
coming
to
help
but
they
were
only
just
beginning
the
ascent
and
the
shouting
blackfellows
were
further
off
still
then
the
dog
could
no
longer
control
its
savage
nature
it
longed
to
leap
at
the
poor
kangaroo
throat
that
pretty
furry
throat
that
dot
arms
had
so
often
encircled
lovingly
and
it
was
impatient
to
fix
its
terrible
teeth
there
and
hold
and
hold
in
a
wild
struggle
until
the
poor
kangaroo
should
gradually
weaken
from
fear
and
exhaustion
and
be
choked
to
death
these
thoughts
filled
the
dog
with
a
wicked
joy
it
wait
any
longer
for
the
other
dingo
hounds
it
wanted
to
murder
the
kangaroo
all
by
itself
so
with
a
toss
of
its
head
and
a
terrible
snarl
it
sprang
forward
ferociously
with
open
jaws
aiming
at
the
victim
throat
dot
clasped
her
cold
hands
together
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
and
her
little
voice
choking
with
sobs
could
only
wail
oh
dear
kangaroo
my
dear
kangaroo
do
kill
my
dear
kangaroo
and
she
ran
forward
to
throw
herself
upon
the
dog
and
try
to
save
her
friend
but
before
the
terrified
little
girl
could
reach
the
big
rock
the
dog
had
made
its
spring
upon
her
friend
the
brave
kangaroo
instead
of
trying
to
avoid
her
fierce
enemy
opened
her
little
arms
and
stood
erect
and
tall
to
receive
the
attack
the
dog
in
its
eagerness
and
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
ground
misjudged
the
distance
it
had
to
spring
it
failed
to
reach
the
throat
it
had
aimed
at
and
in
a
moment
the
kangaroo
had
seized
the
hound
in
a
tight
embrace
there
was
a
momentary
struggle
the
dog
snapping
and
trying
to
free
itself
and
the
kangaroo
holding
it
firmly
then
she
used
the
only
weapon
she
had
to
defend
herself
from
dogs
and
men
the
long
sharp
claw
in
her
foot
whilst
she
held
the
dog
in
her
arms
she
raised
her
powerful
leg
and
with
that
long
strong
claw
tore
open
the
dog
body
the
dog
yelped
in
pain
as
the
kangaroo
threw
it
to
the
ground
where
it
lay
rolling
in
agony
and
dying
for
the
kangaroo
had
given
it
a
terrible
wound
the
other
dogs
were
still
some
distance
below
and
the
cries
of
their
companion
caused
them
to
pause
in
fear
and
wonder
while
the
black
men
could
be
seen
advancing
in
the
dim
light
flourishing
their
spears
and
boomerangs
it
was
quite
impossible
to
retreat
that
way
and
where
dot
and
her
kangaroo
were
they
were
hemmed
in
by
a
rocky
cliff
and
the
deep
black
chasm
the
kangaroo
saw
at
a
glance
where
lay
their
only
chance
of
life
she
picked
up
dot
placed
her
in
her
pouch
and
without
a
word
leaped
forward
towards
that
fearful
gulf
of
darkness
and
foaming
waters
as
they
neared
the
spot
dot
saw
that
the
hunted
animal
was
going
to
try
and
leap
across
to
the
other
side
it
seemed
impossible
that
with
one
bound
she
could
span
that
terrible
place
and
reach
the
sedged
morass
beyond
and
still
more
impossible
that
it
should
be
done
by
the
poor
animal
with
heavy
dot
in
her
pouch
again
dot
cried
oh
darling
kangaroo
leave
me
here
and
save
yourself
you
can
never
never
do
it
carrying
me
all
she
heard
was
something
like
try
or
we
die
she
could
not
make
out
what
the
kangaroo
said
for
the
crashing
of
the
waterfall
the
whistling
of
the
wind
and
the
scattering
of
stones
as
they
dashed
forward
made
such
a
storm
of
noises
in
her
ears
she
could
see
when
they
reached
the
grassy
fringe
of
the
precipice
where
the
kangaroo
was
able
to
quicken
her
pace
and
literally
seemed
to
fly
to
their
fate
then
came
the
last
bound
before
the
great
spring
dot
held
her
breath
and
a
feeling
of
sickness
came
over
her
her
head
seemed
giddy
and
she
could
not
see
but
she
clasped
her
hands
together
and
said
god
help
my
kangaroo
and
then
she
felt
the
fearful
leap
and
rush
through
the
air
yes
they
had
just
reached
the
other
side
no
they
had
not
quite
what
was
the
matter
what
a
struggle
stones
falling
twigs
and
grasses
wrenching
the
courageous
kangaroo
fighting
for
a
foothold
on
the
very
brink
of
the
precipice
what
a
terrible
moment
every
second
dot
felt
sure
they
would
fall
backward
and
drop
deep
into
the
gully
below
to
be
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
and
the
tree
tops
but
god
did
help
kangaroo
the
little
reeds
and
rushes
held
tightly
in
the
earth
and
the
poor
struggling
animal
exerting
all
her
remaining
strength
gained
the
reedy
slope
safely
she
staggered
forward
a
few
reeling
hops
and
then
fell
to
the
earth
like
a
dead
creature
in
an
instant
dot
was
out
of
the
pouch
and
had
her
arm
round
the
poor
animal
neck
crying
as
she
saw
blood
and
foam
oozing
from
her
mouth
and
a
strange
dim
look
in
her
sad
eyes
do
die
dear
kangaroo
oh
please
do
die
cried
dot
wringing
her
hands
and
burying
her
face
in
the
fur
of
the
poor
gasping
creature
dot
panted
the
kangaroo
make
a
noise
cry
loud
not
safe
yet
the
little
girl
did
understand
why
the
kangaroo
wanted
her
to
make
a
noise
and
she
had
in
her
fear
and
sorrow
quite
forgotten
their
pursuers
but
now
she
turned
and
could
hear
the
blacks
urging
on
their
dogs
as
they
were
making
an
attempt
to
skirt
round
the
precipice
and
gain
the
other
side
of
the
chasm
so
dot
did
as
she
was
told
and
screamed
and
cried
like
the
most
naughty
of
children
and
the
gasping
kangaroo
told
her
to
go
on
doing
so
illustration
a
leap
for
life
then
what
seemed
to
dot
a
very
terrifying
thing
happened
for
she
soon
heard
other
cries
mingle
with
hers
from
the
desolate
morass
and
from
the
gully
in
darkness
below
came
the
sound
of
a
bellowing
she
stopped
crying
and
listened
and
could
hear
those
awesome
voices
all
around
and
the
echoes
made
them
still
more
hobgoblinish
the
kangaroo
eyes
brightened
as
she
restrained
her
panting
and
listened
also
go
on
she
said
we
safe
now
so
dot
made
more
crying
and
her
noises
and
the
others
would
have
frightened
anyone
who
had
heard
them
in
that
lonely
place
with
the
wind
storming
in
the
trees
and
the
black
clouds
flying
over
the
moon
it
frightened
the
blackfellows
directly
they
stopped
in
their
headlong
speed
shouting
together
in
their
shrill
voices
the
bunyip
the
bunyip
and
they
tumbled
over
one
another
in
their
hurry
to
get
away
from
a
place
haunted
as
they
thought
by
that
wicked
demon
which
they
fear
so
much
at
full
speed
they
fled
back
to
their
camp
with
the
sound
of
dot
cries
and
the
mysterious
bellowing
noise
following
them
on
the
breeze
and
they
never
stopped
running
until
they
regained
the
light
of
their
camp
fires
there
they
told
the
gins
in
voices
how
it
had
been
no
kangaroo
they
had
hunted
but
the
bunyip
who
had
pretended
to
be
one
and
the
black
gins
eyes
grew
wider
and
wider
and
they
made
strange
noises
and
exclamations
as
they
listened
to
the
story
of
how
the
bunyip
had
led
the
huntsmen
to
that
dreadful
place
how
it
had
torn
one
of
the
dogs
to
pieces
and
had
leaped
over
the
precipice
into
dead
man
gully
where
it
had
cried
like
a
picaninny
and
bellowed
like
a
bull
no
one
slept
in
the
camp
that
night
and
early
next
morning
the
whole
tribe
went
away
being
afraid
to
remain
so
near
the
haunt
of
the
dreaded
bunyip
dot
saw
the
flight
of
the
blacks
in
the
dim
distance
and
told
the
good
news
to
the
kangaroo
who
however
was
too
exhausted
to
rejoice
at
their
escape
she
still
lay
where
she
had
fallen
gasping
and
with
her
tongue
hanging
down
from
her
mouth
like
that
of
a
dog
in
vain
dot
caressed
her
and
called
her
by
endearing
names
she
lay
quite
still
as
if
unable
to
hear
or
feel
dot
little
heart
swelled
within
her
and
taking
the
poor
animal
drooping
head
on
her
lap
she
sat
quite
still
and
tearless
waiting
in
that
solitude
for
her
one
friend
to
die
leaving
her
lonely
and
helpless
presently
she
was
startled
by
hearing
a
brisk
voice
then
it
was
a
human
picaninny
after
all
well
my
dear
what
are
you
doing
here
dot
turned
her
head
without
moving
and
saw
a
little
way
behind
her
a
brown
bird
on
long
legs
standing
with
its
feet
close
together
with
the
air
of
a
dancing
master
about
to
begin
a
lesson
dot
did
not
care
for
any
other
creature
in
the
bush
just
then
but
her
kangaroo
and
the
perky
air
of
the
bird
annoyed
her
in
her
sorrow
without
answering
she
bent
her
head
closer
down
to
that
of
her
poor
friend
to
see
if
her
eyes
were
still
shut
and
wondered
if
they
would
ever
open
and
look
bright
and
gentle
again
the
little
brown
bird
strutted
with
an
important
air
to
where
it
had
a
better
view
of
dot
and
her
companion
and
eyed
them
both
in
the
same
perky
manner
friend
kangaroo
in
a
bad
way
it
said
why
do
you
do
something
sensible
instead
of
messing
about
with
its
head
what
can
i
do
whimpered
dot
give
it
water
and
damp
its
skin
of
course
said
the
little
bird
contemptuously
what
fools
humans
are
it
exclaimed
to
itself
and
i
suppose
you
will
tell
me
there
is
no
water
here
when
all
the
time
you
are
sitting
on
a
spring
but
i
sitting
on
grass
said
dot
now
fully
attentive
to
the
remarks
well
booby
sneered
the
bird
and
under
the
grass
is
wet
moss
which
if
you
make
a
hole
in
it
will
fill
with
water
why
i
do
it
myself
in
a
moment
only
your
claws
are
better
suited
for
the
purpose
than
mine
set
about
it
at
once
it
said
sharply
in
an
instant
dot
did
what
the
bird
directed
and
thrust
her
little
hands
into
the
soft
grass
roots
and
moss
out
of
which
water
pressed
as
if
from
a
sponge
she
had
soon
made
a
little
hole
and
the
most
beautiful
clear
water
welled
up
into
it
at
once
then
in
the
hollows
of
her
little
hands
she
collected
it
and
dashed
it
over
the
parched
tongue
and
further
instructed
by
the
kindly
though
rude
little
bird
she
had
soon
well
wetted
the
suffering
animal
fur
gradually
the
breathing
of
the
kangaroo
became
less
of
an
effort
her
tongue
moistened
and
returned
to
the
mouth
and
at
last
dot
saw
with
joy
the
brown
eyes
open
and
she
knew
that
her
good
friend
was
not
going
to
die
but
would
get
well
again
whilst
all
this
took
place
the
little
brown
bird
stood
on
one
leg
with
its
head
cocked
on
one
side
watching
the
exhausted
kangaroo
recovery
with
a
comic
expression
of
curiosity
and
conceit
when
it
spoke
to
dot
it
did
so
without
any
attempt
at
being
polite
and
dot
thought
it
the
strangest
possible
creature
because
it
was
really
very
kind
in
helping
her
to
save
the
kangaroo
life
and
yet
it
seemed
to
delight
in
spoiling
its
kindheartedness
by
its
rudeness
afterwards
the
kangaroo
told
her
that
the
little
bittern
is
a
really
fellow
but
he
has
an
idea
that
kindness
in
rather
small
creatures
provokes
the
contempt
of
the
big
ones
as
he
always
wants
to
be
thought
a
bigger
bird
than
he
is
he
pretends
to
be
by
being
rough
consequently
nearly
all
the
bush
creatures
simply
regard
him
as
a
rude
little
bird
because
bad
manners
are
no
proof
of
being
rather
the
contrary
how
do
you
feel
now
asked
the
bittern
as
the
kangaroo
presently
struggled
up
and
squatted
rather
feebly
on
her
haunches
looking
about
in
a
somewhat
dazed
way
i
better
now
said
the
kangaroo
but
dear
me
how
everything
seems
to
dance
up
and
down
she
shut
her
eyes
for
she
felt
giddy
that
was
rather
a
good
jump
of
yours
said
the
bittern
patronizingly
as
if
jumps
for
life
like
that
of
dot
kangaroo
were
made
every
day
and
he
was
a
judge
of
them
ah
i
remember
said
the
kangaroo
opening
her
eyes
again
and
looking
round
where
is
dot
umph
that
silly
exclaimed
the
bittern
as
dot
came
forward
and
she
and
the
kangaroo
rejoiced
over
each
other
safety
much
good
have
been
to
you
with
the
blacks
and
their
dogs
after
you
if
we
bitterns
had
played
that
old
trick
of
ours
of
scaring
them
with
our
big
voices
he
he
he
it
chuckled
how
they
did
run
when
we
tuned
up
they
thought
the
bunyip
had
got
them
this
time
did
we
laugh
it
was
very
good
of
you
said
the
kangaroo
gratefully
and
it
is
not
the
first
time
you
have
saved
kangaroos
by
your
cleverness
i
know
you
bitterns
were
near
so
i
told
dot
to
make
a
noise
in
the
hope
of
frightening
them
the
bittern
was
really
touched
by
the
kangaroo
gratitude
and
was
delighted
at
being
called
clever
so
it
became
still
more
ungracious
you
need
trouble
me
with
thanks
it
said
indifferently
we
do
it
to
save
you
but
for
our
own
fun
as
for
that
little
stupid
it
continued
with
a
nod
of
the
head
towards
dot
her
squeals
were
no
more
good
than
the
squeak
of
a
tree
frog
in
a
bittern
beak
but
you
were
very
kind
said
dot
and
showed
me
how
to
get
water
to
save
kangaroo
life
the
bittern
was
greatly
pleased
at
this
praise
and
in
consequence
it
got
still
ruder
and
making
a
face
at
dot
exclaimed
yah
and
stalked
off
but
when
it
had
gone
a
few
steps
it
turned
round
and
said
to
the
kangaroo
roughly
if
you
hop
that
way
keeping
to
the
side
of
the
sedges
and
go
half
a
dozen
small
hops
beyond
that
white
gum
tree
you
find
a
little
cave
it
dry
and
warm
and
good
enough
for
kangaroos
and
without
waiting
for
thanks
for
this
last
kind
act
it
spread
its
wings
and
flew
away
chapter
ix
the
kangaroo
hopping
very
weakly
and
little
dot
trudging
over
the
oozy
ground
followed
the
bittern
directions
and
found
the
cave
which
proved
a
very
snug
retreat
here
they
lay
down
together
full
of
happiness
at
their
escape
and
being
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
excitement
they
were
soon
fast
asleep
the
next
day
before
the
sun
rose
the
bittern
visited
the
cave
hullo
you
precious
lazy
pair
i
been
over
there
and
it
tossed
its
beak
in
the
direction
of
the
black
camp
they
off
northward
too
frightened
to
stay
i
thought
you
might
like
the
news
brought
you
since
you
too
lazy
to
get
it
for
yourselves
and
off
it
went
again
without
saying
now
is
he
a
kind
little
fellow
said
the
kangaroo
that
his
way
of
telling
us
that
we
are
safe
thanks
bittern
thanks
they
both
cried
but
the
creamy
brown
bird
paid
no
attention
to
their
gratitude
it
seemed
absorbed
in
looking
for
frogs
on
its
way
all
that
day
the
kangaroo
and
dot
stayed
near
the
cave
so
that
the
poor
animal
might
get
quite
well
again
the
kangaroo
said
she
did
not
know
that
part
of
the
country
and
so
she
had
better
get
her
legs
again
before
they
faced
fresh
dangers
neither
of
them
was
so
bright
and
merry
as
before
the
weather
was
showery
and
dot
kept
thinking
that
perhaps
she
would
never
get
home
now
she
had
been
so
long
away
and
she
kept
remembering
the
time
when
the
little
boy
was
lost
and
sadness
the
kangaroo
too
seemed
melancholy
what
makes
you
sad
asked
dot
i
am
thinking
of
the
last
time
before
this
that
i
was
hunted
it
was
then
i
lost
my
baby
kangaroo
she
replied
oh
you
poor
dear
thing
exclaimed
dot
and
have
you
been
hunted
before
last
night
yes
said
the
kangaroo
with
a
little
weary
sigh
it
was
just
a
few
days
before
i
found
you
white
humans
did
it
that
time
tell
me
all
about
it
said
dot
how
did
you
escape
illustration
the
bittern
helps
dot
i
escaped
then
said
the
kangaroo
settling
herself
on
her
haunches
to
tell
the
tale
in
a
way
i
could
have
done
last
night
but
i
will
die
sooner
than
do
it
again
tell
me
repeated
dot
there
is
not
much
to
tell
said
the
kangaroo
my
little
joey
was
getting
quite
big
and
we
were
very
happy
it
was
a
lovely
joey
it
was
so
strong
and
could
jump
so
well
for
its
size
it
had
the
blackest
of
little
noses
and
hands
and
tail
you
ever
saw
and
big
soft
ears
which
heard
more
quickly
than
mine
all
day
long
i
taught
it
jumping
and
we
played
and
were
merry
from
sunrise
to
sunset
until
that
day
i
had
never
been
sad
and
i
thought
all
the
creatures
must
be
wrong
to
say
that
in
this
beautiful
world
there
could
be
such
cruel
beings
as
they
said
white
humans
were
that
day
taught
me
i
was
wrong
and
i
know
now
that
the
world
is
a
sad
place
because
humans
make
it
so
although
it
was
made
to
be
a
happy
place
we
were
playing
on
the
side
of
a
plain
that
day
and
our
game
was
in
the
long
grass
we
were
having
great
fun
when
suddenly
little
joey
said
creatures
are
coming
big
ones
i
hopped
up
the
stony
rise
that
fringed
the
plain
and
thought
as
i
did
so
i
could
hear
a
new
sound
on
the
breeze
joey
hid
in
the
grass
but
i
went
boldly
into
the
open
on
the
hillside
to
see
where
the
danger
was
i
saw
far
off
humans
on
their
big
animals
that
go
so
quickly
and
directly
i
hopped
into
the
open
they
raised
a
great
noise
like
the
blacks
did
last
night
and
i
could
see
by
the
movement
in
the
grass
that
they
had
those
dreadful
dogs
they
teach
to
kill
us
they
are
far
worse
than
dingoes
joey
heard
the
shouting
and
bounded
into
my
pouch
and
i
went
off
as
fast
as
i
could
it
was
a
worse
hunt
than
last
night
for
it
was
longer
and
there
was
no
darkness
to
help
me
i
gradually
got
ahead
in
the
chase
and
i
knew
if
i
were
alone
i
could
distance
them
all
for
we
had
seen
them
a
long
way
off
but
little
joey
was
heavy
though
not
so
heavy
as
you
are
and
in
the
long
distance
i
began
to
feel
weak
as
i
did
last
night
i
knew
if
i
tried
to
go
on
as
we
were
that
those
cruel
humans
sitting
quietly
on
those
big
beasts
which
have
four
legs
and
never
get
tired
would
overtake
us
and
their
dogs
which
carry
no
weight
and
go
so
fast
would
tear
me
down
before
their
masters
even
arrived
for
i
was
going
gradually
slower
so
i
asked
joey
if
i
dropped
him
into
a
soft
bush
whether
he
would
hide
until
i
came
back
for
him
it
was
our
only
chance
i
had
an
idea
that
if
i
did
that
he
would
be
safe
even
if
i
got
killed
as
they
would
be
more
likely
to
follow
me
and
never
think
i
had
parted
from
my
little
joey
so
we
did
this
and
i
crossed
a
creek
which
put
the
hounds
off
the
scent
and
i
got
away
in
the
dusk
i
came
back
again
to
find
joey
but
he
had
gone
and
i
could
not
find
a
trace
of
him
all
night
and
all
day
i
searched
but
i
never
seen
my
joey
since
said
the
kangaroo
sadly
and
dot
saw
the
tears
dim
her
eyes
dot
could
not
speak
all
she
felt
she
was
so
sorry
for
the
kangaroo
and
so
ashamed
of
being
a
human
she
realized
too
how
good
and
forgiving
this
dear
animal
was
how
she
had
cared
for
her
and
nearly
died
to
save
her
life
in
spite
of
the
wrongs
done
to
her
by
human
beings
when
i
grow
up
she
said
i
will
never
let
anyone
hurt
a
bush
creature
they
shall
all
be
happy
where
i
am
but
there
are
so
many
humans
they
getting
to
be
as
many
as
kangaroos
said
the
animal
reflectively
and
shook
her
head
chapter
x
the
fourth
day
of
dot
wanderings
in
the
bush
dawned
brightly
the
sun
arose
in
a
sky
all
gorgeous
in
gold
and
crimson
and
flashed
upon
a
world
glittering
with
dewy
freshness
sweet
odours
from
the
aromatic
bush
filled
the
air
and
every
living
creature
made
what
noise
it
could
to
show
its
joy
in
being
happy
and
free
in
the
beautiful
bush
rich
and
gurgling
came
the
note
of
the
magpies
the
jovial
kookooburras
saluted
the
sun
with
rollicking
laughter
the
crickets
chirruped
frogs
croaked
in
chorus
or
solemnly
popped
in
deep
vibrating
tones
like
the
ring
of
a
woodman
axe
every
now
and
then
came
the
shriek
of
the
plover
or
the
shrill
cry
of
the
peeweet
and
gayer
and
more
lively
than
all
the
others
was
the
merry
clattering
of
the
big
bush
wagtail
in
the
distance
as
soon
as
the
kangaroo
heard
the
bush
wagtail
she
and
dot
hurried
away
to
find
him
no
christy
minstrel
rattling
his
bones
ever
made
a
merrier
sound
clack
clack
clack
clack
he
rattled
away
as
fast
as
he
could
just
as
if
he
had
a
moment
to
waste
for
taking
breath
and
as
if
the
whole
lovely
world
was
made
for
the
enjoyment
of
bush
wagtails
when
dot
and
the
kangaroo
found
him
he
was
swaying
about
on
a
branch
spreading
his
big
tail
like
a
fan
and
clattering
gaily
but
he
stopped
in
surprise
as
soon
as
he
saw
his
visitors
after
greetings
he
opened
the
conversation
by
talking
of
the
weather
so
as
to
conceal
his
astonishment
at
seeing
dot
and
the
kangaroo
together
lovely
weather
after
the
rain
he
said
the
showers
were
needed
very
much
for
insects
were
getting
scarce
and
i
believe
grass
was
getting
rank
and
not
very
plentiful
there
will
be
a
green
shoot
in
a
few
days
which
will
be
very
welcome
to
kangaroos
i
heard
about
you
losing
your
joey
my
cousin
told
me
i
was
very
sorry
so
sad
ah
well
such
things
will
happen
in
the
bush
to
anyone
we
were
most
fortunate
in
our
brood
none
of
the
chicks
fell
out
of
the
nest
every
one
of
them
escaped
the
butcher
birds
and
were
strong
of
wing
they
are
all
doing
well
in
the
world
then
the
vivacious
bird
came
a
little
nearer
to
the
kangaroo
and
dropping
his
voice
said
but
friend
kangaroo
i
sorry
to
see
you
taken
up
with
humans
you
know
i
have
quite
set
my
face
against
them
although
my
cousin
is
intimate
with
the
whole
race
take
my
word
for
it
they
most
uncertain
friends
two
kookooburras
were
shot
last
week
in
spite
of
government
protection
fact
and
as
the
bird
spoke
he
nodded
his
head
warningly
towards
the
place
where
dot
was
standing
this
little
human
has
been
lost
in
our
bush
said
the
kangaroo
one
had
to
take
care
of
her
you
know
of
course
of
course
there
are
exceptions
to
all
rules
chattered
the
wagtail
and
so
this
is
really
the
lost
little
human
there
has
been
such
a
fuss
about
added
he
eyeing
dot
and
making
a
long
whistle
of
surprise
my
cousin
told
me
all
about
it
then
your
cousin
willy
wagtail
knows
her
lost
way
said
the
kangaroo
joyfully
and
dot
came
a
little
nearer
in
her
eagerness
to
hear
the
good
news
of
course
he
does
answered
the
bird
there
nothing
happens
that
he
does
know
you
should
have
hunted
him
up
i
did
know
where
to
find
him
said
the
kangaroo
and
i
got
into
this
country
which
is
new
to
me
why
he
is
in
the
same
part
that
he
nested
in
last
season
it
no
distance
off
exclaimed
the
wagtail
if
you
could
fly
you
be
there
almost
directly
then
the
bird
gave
a
long
description
of
the
way
they
were
to
follow
to
find
his
cousin
willy
and
with
many
warm
thanks
the
kangaroo
and
dot
bade
him
adieu
as
they
left
the
bush
wagtail
they
could
hear
him
singing
this
song
which
shows
what
a
merry
happy
fellow
he
is
clack
clack
clack
clack
who
could
cry
in
such
weather
with
a
sky
so
blue
and
a
sun
so
bright
sing
winter
winter
is
back
sportive
in
flight
chatter
delight
i
so
glad
that
i
have
the
knack
of
singing
clack
clack
clack
if
you
wish
to
be
happy
just
follow
my
track
take
this
for
a
motto
this
for
a
code
sing
winter
winter
is
back
leave
care
to
a
toad
and
live
la
they
had
no
difficulty
in
following
the
wagtail
directions
they
soon
struck
a
creek
they
had
been
told
to
pursue
to
its
end
and
about
noon
they
found
themselves
in
very
pretty
country
it
reminded
dot
of
the
journey
they
had
made
to
find
the
platypus
for
there
were
the
same
beautiful
growths
of
fern
and
shrubs
there
were
also
great
trailing
creepers
which
hung
down
like
ropes
from
the
tops
of
the
tall
trees
they
had
climbed
these
coils
of
the
creepers
made
capital
swings
and
often
dot
clambered
into
one
of
the
big
loops
and
sat
swinging
herself
to
and
fro
laughing
and
singing
much
to
the
delight
and
amusement
of
the
kangaroo
swing
swing
a
bird
on
the
wing
is
not
more
happy
than
i
stooping
to
earth
and
seeking
the
sky
swing
swing
swing
see
how
high
upward
i
fly
here
midst
the
leaves
i
swing
then
as
fast
to
my
swing
i
cling
down
i
come
from
the
sky
swing
swing
a
bird
on
the
wing
is
not
more
happy
than
i
thus
sang
little
dot
tossing
herself
backwards
and
forwards
and
the
kangaroo
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
something
very
sweet
about
little
humans
and
that
dot
was
certainly
quite
as
nice
as
a
joey
kangaroo
in
the
middle
of
one
of
these
little
swinging
diversions
a
bird
about
the
size
of
a
pigeon
with
the
most
wonderfully
shiny
plumage
flew
to
the
tree
on
which
dot
was
swinging
dot
was
so
struck
by
the
beautiful
glossy
appearance
and
its
brightly
contrasting
yellow
beak
and
legs
that
she
stopped
swinging
at
once
you
a
pretty
bird
she
said
i
am
a
satin
bower
bird
it
said
we
heard
you
singing
and
we
thought
therefore
that
you
probably
enjoy
parties
so
i
have
come
to
invite
you
to
one
of
our
assemblies
which
will
take
place
shortly
friend
kangaroo
we
know
is
of
a
somewhat
serious
nature
but
probably
she
will
do
us
the
pleasure
of
accompanying
you
to
our
little
entertainment
i
shall
have
great
pleasure
in
doing
so
said
the
kangaroo
i
have
not
been
at
any
of
your
parties
for
a
long
time
you
know
i
suppose
that
i
lost
my
little
joey
very
sadly
we
heard
all
about
it
replied
the
bower
bird
in
a
tone
of
exaggerated
almost
ridiculous
sadness
for
it
was
so
anxious
that
the
kangaroo
should
think
that
it
felt
very
deeply
for
her
loss
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
meeting
at
the
time
the
wallaby
brought
the
news
and
we
were
so
sad
that
we
nearly
broke
up
our
assembly
but
it
would
have
been
a
pity
to
do
so
really
as
the
young
birds
enjoy
themselves
so
much
at
the
of
pleasure
but
said
the
satin
bird
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
from
extreme
sorrow
to
one
of
vivacious
interest
i
must
show
you
the
way
to
the
bower
or
you
would
never
find
it
dot
jumped
down
from
the
swing
and
she
and
the
kangaroo
guided
by
the
satin
bird
made
their
way
through
some
very
bush
the
bird
was
certainly
right
in
saying
that
they
would
never
have
found
the
bower
of
pleasure
without
a
guide
it
was
carefully
concealed
in
the
most
scrub
as
they
were
pushing
their
way
through
a
thicket
of
shrubs
before
reaching
the
open
space
where
the
satin
bower
was
built
they
heard
an
increasing
noise
of
birds
all
talking
to
one
another
the
din
of
this
chattering
was
enhanced
considerably
by
the
shrill
sounds
of
and
crickets
and
the
hubbub
made
dot
feel
like
the
little
native
bear
as
if
her
head
was
empty
this
will
be
a
very
pleasant
party
said
the
satin
bird
there
is
plenty
of
conversation
so
everyone
in
a
good
humour
do
you
think
anyone
is
listening
or
are
they
all
talking
enquired
the
kangaroo
timidly
nobody
would
attempt
to
listen
answered
the
satin
bird
it
would
be
impossible
against
the
music
of
the
tree
frogs
and
crickets
so
everyone
talks
i
should
tell
the
and
crickets
to
be
quiet
said
dot
no
one
seems
to
care
for
their
music
oh
without
music
it
would
be
very
dull
explained
the
satin
bird
no
one
would
care
to
talk
you
understand
it
would
be
awkward
someone
might
overhear
what
was
said
as
the
bird
spoke
the
trio
reached
the
place
where
the
bower
was
situated
dot
thought
it
a
most
curious
sight
in
the
middle
of
an
open
space
the
birds
had
built
a
flooring
of
twigs
and
upon
that
they
had
erected
a
bower
about
three
feet
high
also
constructed
of
twigs
interwoven
with
grass
and
arranged
so
as
nearly
to
meet
at
the
top
in
an
arched
form
it
a
new
bower
and
more
commodious
than
our
last
said
the
satin
bird
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
what
do
you
think
of
the
decorations
in
a
temporary
lull
of
the
frog
and
cricket
band
and
the
conversation
dot
and
the
kangaroo
praised
the
bower
and
its
decorations
and
enquired
politely
how
the
birds
had
managed
to
procure
such
a
collection
of
ornaments
for
their
pleasure
hall
several
young
bower
birds
came
and
joined
in
the
chat
and
dot
was
surprised
to
see
how
different
their
plumage
was
from
the
satin
of
the
old
birds
these
younger
members
of
the
community
were
of
a
greenish
yellow
colour
with
dark
pencillings
on
their
feathers
and
had
no
glossy
sheen
like
their
elders
each
of
them
pointed
out
some
ornament
that
it
had
brought
with
which
to
deck
the
bower
one
had
brought
the
pink
feathers
of
a
galah
which
had
been
stuck
here
and
there
amongst
the
twigs
others
had
collected
the
delicate
shells
of
land
snails
and
put
them
round
about
the
entrance
but
the
birds
that
were
proudest
of
their
contributions
were
those
who
had
picked
up
odds
and
ends
at
the
camps
of
bushmen
that
beautiful
bright
thing
i
brought
from
a
camp
a
mile
away
said
a
bird
indicating
a
tag
from
a
cake
of
tobacco
but
it
is
so
pretty
as
mine
said
another
pointing
to
the
glass
stopper
of
a
sauce
bottle
or
mine
chimed
in
another
bird
as
it
claimed
a
bright
piece
of
tin
from
a
that
was
inserted
in
the
twigs
just
above
the
entrance
of
the
bower
nonsense
children
said
a
grave
old
satin
bird
your
trifles
are
not
to
be
compared
with
that
beautiful
object
i
found
and
arranged
along
the
top
of
the
bower
the
effect
is
splendid
as
he
spoke
dot
observed
that
twined
amidst
the
topmost
twigs
of
the
construction
was
a
strip
of
red
flannel
from
an
old
shirt
a
bedraggled
red
rag
that
must
have
been
found
in
an
extinct
camp
fire
judging
by
its
singed
edges
the
day
dot
had
lost
her
way
she
had
been
threading
beads
and
she
still
had
upon
her
finger
a
ring
of
the
pretty
coloured
pieces
of
glass
she
saw
the
old
satin
bird
look
at
this
ring
longingly
so
she
pulled
it
off
and
begged
that
it
might
be
added
to
the
other
decorations
it
was
instantly
given
the
place
of
honour
over
the
entrance
and
above
the
piece
of
milk
tin
this
gift
from
dot
caused
an
immediate
flow
of
conversation
because
every
bird
was
pleased
to
have
something
to
talk
about
they
all
began
to
say
how
beautiful
the
beads
were
quite
too
lovely
said
one
what
a
charming
little
human
exclaimed
another
just
the
finish
that
our
bower
required
was
a
general
remark
and
a
great
many
kept
exclaiming
so
tasteful
so
sweet
how
elegant
exquisite
it
a
love
it
a
dear
and
so
on
a
great
deal
more
was
said
but
the
oldest
bower
bird
thinking
that
all
the
adjectives
were
getting
used
up
told
the
frogs
and
crickets
to
start
the
music
again
so
as
to
keep
the
excitement
going
and
all
further
observations
were
drowned
in
the
noise
presently
the
younger
birds
flew
down
to
the
bower
and
began
to
play
and
dance
like
a
troop
of
children
they
ran
round
and
round
the
bower
and
to
and
fro
through
it
gleefully
chasing
each
other
then
they
would
assemble
in
groups
and
hop
up
and
down
and
dance
to
one
another
in
what
dot
thought
a
rather
awkward
fashion
but
she
was
thinking
of
the
elegance
and
grace
of
the
native
companions
who
can
make
beautiful
movements
with
their
long
legs
and
necks
whilst
these
little
bower
birds
are
rather
ungainly
in
their
steps
what
amused
her
was
to
see
how
the
young
cock
birds
showed
off
to
the
little
hens
they
were
conceited
fellows
and
only
seemed
happy
when
they
had
five
or
six
little
hens
looking
admiringly
at
their
every
movement
at
such
times
they
would
dance
and
hop
with
great
delight
and
the
little
hens
in
a
circle
round
them
watched
their
hops
and
steps
with
absorbed
interest
immensely
pleased
with
himself
the
young
dancer
would
fluff
out
his
feathers
so
as
to
look
as
big
as
possible
and
after
strutting
about
would
suddenly
shoot
out
a
leg
and
a
wing
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
then
spring
high
into
the
air
and
do
a
sort
of
step
dance
when
his
feet
touched
the
earth
again
endless
were
the
tricks
he
resorted
to
to
show
off
his
feathers
and
dancing
to
the
best
advantage
and
the
little
hens
watched
it
all
with
silent
intentness
in
the
meantime
the
frogs
and
crickets
stopped
to
rest
and
dot
could
hear
the
conversation
of
some
of
the
old
birds
perched
near
her
a
little
party
of
elderly
hens
were
discussing
the
young
birds
who
were
dancing
at
the
bower
i
must
say
i
do
admire
that
new
step
which
is
becoming
so
popular
amongst
the
young
birds
said
one
elderly
hen
and
all
her
companions
rustled
their
feathers
closed
their
beaks
tightly
and
nodded
their
heads
in
various
ways
one
said
it
was
rough
another
that
it
was
ungainly
and
others
that
it
was
unmannerly
as
for
manners
said
the
first
speaker
the
bower
birds
of
this
day
ca
be
said
to
have
any
and
all
her
companions
chorused
no
indeed
illustration
the
bower
birds
in
my
young
day
continued
the
elderly
hen
and
all
the
group
were
sighing
ah
in
our
young
days
when
a
young
hen
perched
on
a
bough
above
them
and
interrupted
pertly
dear
me
ca
you
good
birds
find
anything
more
interesting
to
talk
about
than
ancient
history
at
this
the
groups
of
gossips
whispered
angrily
to
one
another
minx
hussy
wild
cat
and
the
rude
young
bird
flew
back
to
her
companions
what
i
object
to
most
in
young
birds
said
another
elderly
hen
is
their
appearance
some
of
them
do
nothing
all
day
but
preen
their
feathers
look
at
the
arrangements
of
their
wing
flights
and
the
affected
exactness
of
their
tail
feathers
one
looks
in
vain
for
sweetness
and
simplicity
in
the
young
bower
birds
even
that
is
better
than
the
newer
fashion
of
scarcely
preening
the
feathers
at
all
observed
yet
another
of
the
group
many
of
the
young
birds
take
no
pride
in
their
feathers
whatever
but
devote
all
their
time
to
studying
the
habits
of
insects
a
chorus
of
disapproval
from
all
present
supported
this
remark
studies
that
interfere
with
a
young
hen
appearance
should
not
be
permitted
said
one
bird
what
is
the
good
of
knowing
all
about
insects
when
we
live
on
berries
and
fruit
asked
another
the
sight
of
insects
gives
one
the
creeps
said
a
third
i
am
thankful
to
say
all
my
little
hens
care
for
nothing
beyond
playing
at
the
bower
and
preening
their
feathers
said
an
affectionate
bower
bird
mother
they
get
a
deal
of
attention
paid
to
them
no
young
satin
bird
would
look
at
a
learned
little
said
the
bird
who
had
first
objected
to
untidy
and
studious
young
hens
for
my
part
i
never
allow
a
chick
of
mine
even
to
mention
insects
unless
they
are
beetles
dot
thought
this
chattering
very
stupid
so
she
went
round
a
bush
to
where
the
old
fathers
of
the
bower
birds
were
perched
they
were
grave
old
fellows
arrayed
in
their
satin
plumage
and
she
found
them
all
more
or
less
in
a
grumbling
humour
birds
at
our
time
of
life
should
not
have
to
attend
parties
said
several
and
dot
wondered
why
they
came
how
are
you
old
neighbour
said
one
to
another
terribly
bored
was
the
reply
how
long
must
we
stay
do
you
think
asked
another
oh
until
these
young
fools
have
finished
amusing
themselves
answered
its
friend
the
only
satin
birds
who
seemed
to
dot
to
be
interested
in
one
another
were
some
engaged
in
discussing
the
scarcity
of
berries
and
the
wrongs
done
to
bower
birds
by
white
humans
destroying
the
wild
fig
and
lillipilli
trees
this
grievance
and
the
question
as
to
what
berries
or
figs
agreed
best
with
each
old
bower
bird
digestion
were
the
only
topics
discussed
with
any
animation
dot
soon
tired
of
listening
to
the
birds
and
returned
to
the
kangaroo
who
asked
her
if
she
cared
to
stay
any
longer
the
little
girl
said
she
had
seen
and
heard
enough
and
judging
by
this
one
she
did
care
for
parties
neither
do
i
whispered
the
kangaroo
they
make
me
feel
tired
and
somehow
they
seem
to
remind
one
of
everything
one
knows
that
sad
in
spite
of
all
the
gaiety
is
it
gay
enquired
dot
hesitating
a
little
in
her
speech
for
she
had
felt
rather
dull
and
miserable
well
everyone
says
it
gay
and
there
is
always
a
deal
of
noise
so
i
suppose
it
is
answered
the
kangaroo
i
rather
be
in
your
pouch
so
let
us
go
away
entreated
dot
and
they
left
the
bower
place
without
any
of
the
birds
noticing
their
departure
for
they
were
all
busy
gossiping
or
discussing
the
great
berry
or
digestion
questions
it
was
towards
evening
when
they
reached
an
open
plain
and
here
they
met
an
emu
as
both
dot
and
the
kangaroo
were
thirsty
they
asked
the
emu
the
way
to
a
waterhole
or
tank
i
am
going
to
a
tank
now
replied
the
emu
let
us
proceed
together
do
you
think
it
will
be
safe
to
drink
enquired
the
kangaroo
anxiously
well
to
tell
the
truth
said
the
emu
lightly
it
is
likely
to
be
a
little
difficult
there
is
a
somewhat
strained
feeling
between
the
white
humans
and
ourselves
just
now
in
consequence
we
have
to
resort
to
a
little
strategy
on
our
visits
to
the
tanks
and
we
avoid
eating
anything
tempting
left
about
at
camping
places
are
they
laying
poison
for
asked
the
kangaroo
in
horrified
tones
they
are
doing
something
of
the
kind
we
think
answered
the
emu
airily
for
some
of
us
have
had
most
unpleasant
symptoms
after
picking
up
morsels
at
camping
grounds
several
have
died
we
were
quite
surprised
for
hitherto
there
has
been
no
better
cure
for
emu
indigestion
than
wire
nails
hoop
iron
and
preserved
milk
cans
the
worst
symptoms
have
yielded
to
scraps
of
barbed
wire
in
my
own
case
but
these
emus
died
in
spite
of
all
remedies
but
i
heard
said
the
kangaroo
that
emus
were
protected
by
the
government
i
never
understood
why
we
are
protected
said
the
huge
bird
because
we
form
part
of
the
australian
arms
so
do
we
said
the
kangaroo
but
we
are
not
protected
true
said
the
bird
but
the
humans
can
make
some
money
out
of
you
when
you
are
dead
whereas
we
serve
no
purpose
at
all
excepting
alive
when
we
add
a
charm
to
the
scenery
and
moreover
each
of
our
eggs
will
make
a
pound
cake
but
the
time
will
come
friend
when
there
will
be
neither
emu
nor
kangaroo
for
australia
arms
no
creature
will
be
left
to
represent
the
land
but
the
bunny
rabbit
and
the
sheep
i
hate
sheep
said
the
kangaroo
they
eat
all
our
grass
you
have
not
studied
them
as
we
have
answered
the
emu
they
are
most
entertaining
we
have
great
fun
with
them
and
we
learnt
some
capital
sheep
games
from
those
dogs
humans
drive
them
with
it
really
exciting
to
drive
a
big
mob
when
they
want
to
break
and
scatter
we
were
chasing
them
here
and
there
all
over
the
plain
i
do
like
sheep
said
dot
they
are
so
stupid
so
they
are
agreed
the
emu
and
that
is
what
puzzles
me
what
is
it
about
the
sight
of
sheep
that
excites
one
so
when
one
gets
into
a
big
flock
one
has
to
dance
one
ca
help
oneself
we
had
a
great
dance
in
a
flock
and
the
lambs
would
get
under
our
feet
so
i
sorry
to
say
a
good
many
of
them
were
killed
men
will
certainly
kill
you
if
you
do
that
said
dot
we
know
it
chuckled
the
emu
that
is
why
the
tank
is
not
quite
safe
just
now
but
this
evening
i
will
show
you
a
new
plan
by
which
to
learn
if
humans
are
camped
at
a
tank
or
not
we
have
played
the
trick
with
great
success
for
several
nights
conversing
thus
the
emu
the
kangaroo
and
dot
wandered
on
until
the
emu
requested
them
to
wait
for
a
few
minutes
whilst
it
peeped
at
the
tank
which
was
still
a
long
way
off
it
presently
returned
and
said
that
it
felt
quite
suspicious
because
everything
looked
so
clear
and
safe
from
this
point
of
high
ground
said
the
bird
you
can
watch
our
proceedings
i
will
now
give
the
signal
and
return
to
my
post
here
the
emu
then
ran
at
a
great
pace
along
the
edge
of
the
plain
and
emitted
a
strange
rattling
cry
after
disappearing
from
sight
for
a
time
it
returned
hurriedly
to
where
dot
and
her
friend
were
waiting
now
see
said
the
emu
nodding
at
the
distant
side
of
the
plain
dot
eyes
were
not
so
keen
of
sight
as
those
of
an
emu
but
she
thought
she
could
see
something
like
a
little
cloud
of
dust
far
far
away
across
the
dry
brown
grass
of
the
plain
soon
she
was
quite
sure
that
the
little
cloud
was
advancing
towards
her
side
of
the
plain
and
in
the
direction
of
the
tank
as
it
came
nearer
she
could
see
the
bobbing
heads
of
emus
popping
up
above
the
dust
and
she
could
see
some
of
the
birds
running
round
the
little
cloud
what
is
the
cause
of
all
that
dust
she
asked
the
emu
sheep
it
answered
with
a
merry
chuckle
but
what
are
the
emus
doing
with
the
sheep
asked
dot
and
the
kangaroo
now
fully
interested
in
the
emu
manoeuvre
they
are
driving
them
to
water
at
the
tank
said
the
bird
highly
delighted
with
the
scheme
the
sheep
will
soon
know
that
they
are
near
water
and
will
go
to
it
without
driving
then
we
shall
watch
and
if
they
quietly
drink
and
scatter
it
will
be
safe
for
us
but
if
they
see
anything
unusual
and
break
and
run
well
we
sha
drink
at
the
tank
there
will
be
humans
and
dogs
there
and
we
do
cultivate
their
society
just
now
really
that
is
the
cleverest
thing
i
have
heard
for
a
long
time
said
the
kangaroo
full
of
admiration
for
the
trick
how
did
you
jump
to
that
conclusion
the
idea
sprang
upon
us
answered
the
emu
with
an
immense
hop
in
the
air
and
a
dancing
movement
when
it
came
to
the
ground
again
dear
me
it
exclaimed
the
sight
of
those
sheep
is
beginning
to
excite
me
and
i
can
hardly
keep
still
i
wonder
what
there
is
so
exciting
about
sheep
dot
could
now
see
the
advancing
flock
of
sheep
with
their
attendant
mob
of
emu
quite
well
the
animals
had
got
scent
of
the
water
and
with
contented
bleatings
were
slowly
moving
with
a
rippling
effect
across
the
dusty
plain
the
mob
of
emu
soon
left
the
sheep
to
go
their
own
way
and
grouped
in
a
cluster
watched
with
bobbing
heads
every
movement
of
the
flock
dot
the
kangaroo
and
the
emu
looked
towards
the
tank
with
silent
interest
i
stationed
here
whispered
the
bird
to
give
a
warning
in
case
there
is
any
danger
in
this
direction
emus
are
posted
all
round
the
tank
on
the
same
duty
dot
could
see
the
whole
scene
well
for
beyond
a
few
low
shrubs
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
sheet
of
water
there
was
no
sheltering
bush
near
the
great
tank
which
had
been
excavated
on
the
bare
plain
illustration
the
emus
hunting
the
sheep
onward
came
the
sheep
and
quite
stationary
in
the
distance
remained
the
emu
mob
just
as
the
first
sheep
were
descending
the
deep
slope
of
the
tank
a
plover
rose
from
amongst
the
bushes
with
a
shrill
cry
the
emu
started
at
the
sound
and
whispered
to
the
kangaroo
there
be
no
drink
watch
the
cry
of
the
plover
seemed
to
arrest
the
advance
of
the
timid
sheep
they
waited
in
a
flock
looking
around
but
presently
the
old
leader
gave
a
deep
bleat
and
they
moved
forward
towards
the
water
shriek
shriek
cried
the
plover
from
the
bushes
screaming
as
they
rose
and
flew
away
and
suddenly
the
flock
of
sheep
broke
and
hurried
back
to
the
open
plain
at
the
same
instant
dot
could
hear
the
sharp
barking
of
a
sheep
dog
a
noise
that
produced
an
instant
effect
on
the
creatures
she
was
with
with
lightning
speed
the
kangaroo
had
popped
her
into
her
pouch
and
was
hopping
away
and
the
emu
was
striding
with
its
long
legs
as
fast
as
it
could
for
the
cover
of
the
bush
just
as
they
entered
the
bush
shelter
dot
peeped
out
of
the
pouch
across
the
plain
and
could
see
the
mob
of
emu
in
a
cloud
of
dust
running
and
almost
out
of
sight
when
they
had
reached
a
place
of
safety
the
friendly
emu
bid
the
kangaroo
and
dot
we
shall
have
to
go
thirsty
it
said
but
there
will
be
a
heavy
dew
and
the
grass
will
be
wet
enough
to
cool
one
mouth
that
pretty
trick
of
ours
was
such
a
success
that
it
is
almost
worth
one
while
to
lose
one
drink
in
proving
it
turning
to
dot
it
said
you
will
be
able
to
tell
the
big
humans
that
we
emus
are
not
such
fools
as
they
think
and
that
we
find
their
flocks
of
silly
sheep
most
useful
and
entertaining
animals
chuckling
to
itself
the
emu
strode
off
leaving
dot
and
the
kangaroo
to
pass
another
night
in
the
solitude
of
the
bush
chapter
xi
the
next
day
they
travelled
a
long
distance
at
about
noon
they
came
to
a
part
of
the
country
which
the
kangaroo
said
she
knew
well
but
we
must
be
careful
she
added
as
we
are
very
near
humans
in
this
part
as
dot
was
tired
for
she
had
had
to
walk
much
more
than
usual
the
kangaroo
suggested
that
she
should
rest
at
the
pretty
spot
they
had
reached
whilst
she
herself
went
in
search
of
willy
wagtail
dot
had
to
promise
the
kangaroo
over
and
over
again
not
to
leave
the
spot
during
her
absence
she
was
afraid
lest
the
little
girl
should
get
lost
like
the
little
joey
after
many
farewells
and
much
hopping
back
to
give
dot
warnings
and
make
promises
of
returning
soon
the
kangaroo
went
in
search
of
willy
wagtail
and
the
little
girl
was
left
all
alone
dot
looked
for
a
nice
shady
nook
in
which
to
lie
down
and
rest
and
she
found
the
place
so
cheerful
and
pretty
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
being
alone
she
was
in
the
hollow
of
an
old
watercourse
it
was
rather
like
an
english
forest
glade
it
was
so
open
and
grassy
and
here
and
there
were
pretty
shrubs
and
little
hillocks
and
hollows
at
first
dot
thought
that
she
would
sit
on
the
branch
of
a
huge
tree
that
had
but
recently
fallen
and
lay
forlornly
clothed
in
withered
leaves
but
opposite
to
this
dead
giant
of
the
bush
was
a
thick
shrub
with
a
decayed
tree
stump
beside
it
that
made
a
nice
sheltered
corner
which
she
liked
better
so
dot
laid
herself
down
there
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
fast
asleep
though
as
she
dropped
off
into
the
land
of
dreams
she
thought
how
wonderfully
quiet
that
little
glade
was
and
felt
somewhat
surprised
to
find
no
bush
creatures
to
keep
her
company
some
time
before
dot
woke
her
dreams
became
confused
and
strange
there
seemed
to
be
great
crowds
in
them
and
the
murmur
of
many
voices
talking
together
as
she
gradually
awakened
she
realized
that
the
voices
were
real
and
not
a
part
of
her
dreams
there
was
a
great
hubbub
a
fluttering
of
wings
and
rustling
of
leaves
and
grass
through
all
this
confusion
odd
sentences
became
clear
to
her
drowsy
senses
such
phrases
as
you
better
perch
here
this
is
your
place
go
over
there
no
no
i
sure
i
right
the
welcome
swallow
says
so
has
anyone
gone
for
the
opossum
he
says
the
court
ought
to
be
held
at
night
do
make
such
a
noise
or
you
will
wake
the
prisoner
who
is
to
be
the
judge
this
last
enquiry
provoked
such
a
noise
of
diverse
opinions
that
dot
became
fully
awake
and
sitting
up
gazed
around
with
eyes
full
of
astonishment
when
she
had
fallen
asleep
there
had
not
been
a
creature
near
her
but
now
she
was
literally
hemmed
in
on
every
side
by
birds
and
small
animals
the
branches
of
the
fallen
tree
were
covered
with
a
feathered
company
and
in
the
open
space
between
it
and
dot
nook
was
a
constantly
increasing
crowd
of
larger
birds
such
as
cranes
plover
duck
black
swan
and
amongst
them
a
great
grave
pelican
the
animals
were
few
and
apparently
came
late
there
was
a
little
timid
wallaby
a
bandicoot
some
kangaroo
rats
a
shy
wombat
who
grumbled
about
the
daylight
as
also
did
a
native
bear
and
an
opossum
who
were
really
driven
to
the
gathering
by
a
bevy
of
screaming
parrots
dot
was
wide
awake
at
once
with
delight
nearly
every
creature
she
had
ever
heard
of
seemed
to
be
present
and
the
brilliant
colours
of
the
parrots
and
parrakeets
made
the
scene
as
gay
as
a
rainbow
in
a
summer
noonday
sky
oh
you
darlings
she
said
how
good
of
you
all
to
come
and
see
me
this
greeting
from
dot
caused
an
instant
silence
amongst
the
creatures
and
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
they
looked
very
uncomfortable
there
was
soon
a
faint
whispering
from
bird
to
bird
which
rose
higher
and
higher
until
dot
made
out
that
they
were
all
saying
she
ought
to
be
told
you
tell
her
no
you
tell
her
yourself
it
not
my
business
and
every
bird
for
it
was
the
birds
who
by
reason
of
their
larger
numbers
took
the
lead
in
the
proceedings
seemed
to
be
trying
to
shift
an
unpleasant
task
upon
its
neighbours
presently
the
solemn
pelican
waddled
forward
and
stood
before
dot
saying
to
the
assemblage
i
will
explain
our
presence
addressing
the
little
girl
it
said
we
are
here
to
place
you
on
trial
for
the
wrongs
we
bush
creatures
have
suffered
from
the
cruelties
of
white
humans
you
will
meet
with
all
fairness
in
your
trial
as
the
proceedings
will
be
conducted
according
to
the
custom
of
your
own
courts
of
justice
the
welcome
swallow
having
built
its
nest
for
three
successive
seasons
under
the
eaves
of
the
gabblebabble
court
house
is
deeply
learned
in
human
law
business
and
will
instruct
us
how
to
proceed
your
conviction
will
therefore
leave
you
no
room
for
complaint
so
far
as
your
trial
is
concerned
all
the
birds
clapped
their
wings
in
applause
at
the
conclusion
of
this
speech
and
the
pelican
was
told
by
the
welcome
swallow
that
he
should
plead
as
prosecutor
what
do
you
mean
by
as
prosecutor
asked
the
pelican
gravely
you
got
to
get
the
prisoner
convicted
as
guilty
whether
she
is
so
or
not
answered
the
swallow
making
a
dart
at
a
mosquito
which
it
ate
with
relish
oh
said
the
pelican
doubtfully
and
all
the
creatures
looked
at
one
another
as
if
they
did
quite
understand
the
justice
of
the
arrangement
but
said
the
pelican
hesitating
a
little
suppose
i
do
think
the
prisoner
guilty
she
seems
very
small
and
harmless
that
does
matter
at
all
you
got
to
get
her
made
out
as
guilty
by
the
jury
it
good
human
law
snapped
the
swallow
and
all
the
creatures
said
now
for
the
defence
said
the
swallow
briskly
there
ought
to
be
someone
for
that
who
is
friendly
with
the
king
who
the
king
asked
all
the
creatures
breathlessly
he
a
bigger
human
than
the
rest
and
everybody
business
is
his
business
so
he
always
going
to
law
i
know
said
the
magpie
and
she
piped
out
six
bars
of
god
save
the
king
you
are
the
one
for
the
defence
said
the
swallow
quite
delighted
as
were
all
the
other
creatures
at
the
magpie
accomplishment
you
must
save
the
prisoner
from
the
jury
finding
her
guilty
but
objected
the
magpie
how
can
i
when
only
last
fruit
season
my
brother
and
two
sisters
and
six
cousins
were
shot
just
because
they
ate
a
few
grapes
that
does
matter
you
got
to
get
her
off
i
tell
you
said
the
swallow
irritably
go
over
there
and
ask
her
what
you
are
to
say
so
the
magpie
flew
over
to
dot
side
and
she
at
once
began
to
teach
it
the
rest
of
god
save
the
king
i
like
this
game
dot
presently
said
to
the
magpie
do
you
said
the
magpie
with
surprise
it
seems
to
me
very
slow
and
there
no
sense
in
it
why
are
the
birds
all
perching
together
over
there
asked
dot
pointing
to
a
branch
of
the
dead
tree
since
they
all
hate
one
another
and
want
to
get
away
the
galahs
have
pecked
the
butcher
bird
twice
in
five
minutes
the
peeweet
keeps
quarrelling
with
the
soldier
bird
and
none
of
them
can
bear
the
english
sparrow
illustration
the
court
of
animals
the
swallow
says
that
the
jury
answered
the
magpie
their
business
is
to
do
just
what
they
like
with
you
when
all
the
talking
is
done
and
whether
they
find
you
guilty
or
not
will
depend
on
if
they
are
tired
or
hungry
and
feel
cross
or
if
the
trial
lasts
only
a
short
time
and
they
are
pleased
with
the
grubs
that
will
be
brought
them
presently
how
funny
said
dot
not
a
bit
alarmed
at
all
these
preparations
for
her
trial
for
she
loved
all
the
creatures
so
much
that
she
could
not
think
that
any
of
them
wished
to
hurt
her
if
this
is
human
law
said
the
magpie
it
is
funny
at
all
it
is
mad
or
wicked
fancy
my
having
to
defend
a
human
at
this
point
of
their
conversation
the
amongst
the
jury
broke
out
into
open
fighting
because
the
english
sparrow
was
a
foreigner
and
they
said
that
it
would
certainly
sympathize
with
the
humans
who
had
brought
it
to
australia
this
was
just
an
excuse
to
get
rid
of
it
the
sparrow
said
that
it
wanted
to
go
out
of
the
jury
and
had
never
wished
to
belong
to
it
and
flew
away
joyfully
then
all
the
rest
of
the
jury
grumbled
at
the
good
luck
of
the
sparrow
in
getting
out
of
the
trial
for
they
could
see
it
picking
up
grass
seed
and
enjoying
itself
greatly
whilst
they
were
all
crowded
together
on
one
branch
and
were
feeling
hungry
before
the
trial
had
even
begun
there
was
great
suspense
and
quiet
while
the
judge
was
being
chosen
although
dot
had
eaten
the
berries
of
understanding
it
was
generally
considered
that
to
be
quite
fair
the
judge
must
be
able
to
understand
human
talk
and
amidst
much
clapping
of
wings
a
large
white
cockatoo
was
appointed
the
cockatoo
lost
no
time
in
clambering
into
position
on
the
stump
near
dot
you
quite
sure
you
understand
human
talk
said
the
little
wallaby
to
the
cockatoo
it
was
the
first
remark
he
had
made
for
he
had
been
quite
bewildered
by
all
the
noise
and
fuss
my
word
yes
replied
the
cockatoo
who
had
been
taught
in
a
public
refreshment
room
then
thinking
that
he
would
give
a
display
of
his
learning
he
elevated
his
sulphur
crest
and
gabbled
off
go
to
jericho
twenty
to
one
on
the
favourite
i
your
man
now
then
hurry
up
do
keep
the
coach
waiting
give
their
bill
so
long
god
save
the
king
all
the
creatures
present
looked
gravely
at
dot
to
see
what
effect
this
harangue
in
her
own
language
would
have
upon
her
and
were
somewhat
surprised
to
see
her
holding
her
little
sides
and
rolling
about
with
laughter
the
cockatoo
was
quite
annoyed
at
dot
amusement
he
fluffed
out
all
his
feathers
and
let
off
a
scream
that
could
have
been
heard
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
this
seemed
to
impress
every
one
with
his
importance
and
the
whole
court
became
attentive
to
the
proceedings
at
this
moment
the
swallow
skimmed
overhead
and
having
caught
the
words
god
save
the
king
called
out
that
the
way
to
do
it
keep
that
up
and
the
cockatoo
thinking
that
the
swallow
meant
him
to
scream
still
more
set
up
another
yell
which
he
continued
until
everyone
felt
deafened
by
the
noise
we
have
chosen
quite
the
right
judge
said
an
elegant
blue
crane
to
a
wild
duck
he
will
make
himself
heard
and
respected
whereat
the
cockatoo
winked
at
the
crane
and
said
you
bet
i
will
the
pelican
now
advanced
to
the
space
before
the
stump
and
there
was
a
murmur
of
excitement
because
it
was
about
to
open
the
trial
by
a
recital
of
wrongs
done
to
the
bush
creatures
by
white
humanity
dot
could
not
realize
that
she
was
being
tried
seriously
and
was
delighted
that
the
pelican
had
come
nearer
to
her
stump
so
that
she
had
a
better
view
of
him
she
thought
him
such
an
old
bird
with
his
big
bald
head
and
gigantic
beak
she
could
not
help
thinking
that
his
beak
must
be
too
heavy
for
him
and
asked
if
he
would
like
to
rest
it
on
the
stump
the
pelican
did
not
understand
dot
kindness
and
gave
her
a
look
of
offended
dignity
that
was
quite
withering
so
dot
did
not
speak
to
him
again
but
she
longed
to
feel
if
the
bag
of
skin
that
drooped
under
his
beak
had
anything
in
it
the
pelican
legs
seemed
to
dot
to
be
too
frail
and
short
to
bear
such
a
big
bird
not
to
mention
the
immense
beak
and
when
the
creature
stood
on
one
leg
only
she
laughed
whereat
the
pelican
gave
her
another
offended
look
which
effectually
prevented
their
becoming
friends
the
pelican
was
beginning
to
open
his
beak
to
speak
and
being
such
a
large
beak
opening
it
took
some
time
when
the
welcome
swallow
fussed
into
court
and
said
that
nothing
could
be
done
until
they
had
some
horsehair
illustration
the
cockatoo
judge
this
interruption
and
the
swallow
repeated
assurance
that
no
human
trial
of
importance
could
take
place
without
horsehair
set
all
the
creatures
chattering
with
astonishment
and
questions
some
said
the
swallow
was
joking
others
said
that
it
was
making
senseless
delays
and
that
night
would
fall
before
they
could
bring
the
prisoner
to
justice
there
was
much
grumbling
on
all
sides
and
complaints
of
hunger
and
the
jury
began
to
clamour
for
the
grubs
that
they
had
been
promised
at
which
the
magpie
whispered
to
dot
that
she
certainly
would
be
found
guilty
the
fact
was
now
quite
clear
to
the
jury
before
the
trial
began
but
the
swallow
persisted
that
they
must
have
horsehair
what
for
asked
everyone
sulkily
do
you
see
for
yourselves
squeaked
the
swallow
excitedly
the
judge
looks
like
a
cockatoo
well
of
course
he
does
said
all
the
creatures
he
is
a
cockatoo
so
he
looks
like
one
yes
cried
the
swallow
but
you
must
stick
horse
hairs
on
his
head
human
justice
must
be
done
with
horsehair
the
prisoner
wo
believe
the
cockatoo
is
a
judge
without
good
gracious
exclaimed
the
swallow
just
look
the
prisoner
is
scratching
the
judge
poll
we
really
have
horsehair
dot
seeing
the
swallow
indignation
drew
away
from
the
stump
and
the
cockatoo
tried
to
look
as
if
he
had
never
seen
her
before
and
as
if
the
idea
of
having
his
poll
scratched
by
the
prisoner
was
one
that
could
never
have
entered
his
head
but
if
we
do
put
horsehair
on
the
cockatoo
head
argued
the
creatures
what
will
it
do
it
will
impress
the
prisoner
said
the
swallow
how
they
all
asked
curiously
because
the
cockatoo
wo
look
like
a
cockatoo
replied
the
swallow
with
exasperation
then
what
will
he
look
like
asked
every
creature
in
breathless
excitement
he
wo
look
like
any
creature
that
ever
lived
retorted
the
swallow
perfect
silence
followed
this
explanation
for
every
bird
and
animal
was
trying
to
understand
human
sense
and
reason
then
the
smallest
kangaroo
rat
broke
the
stillness
if
said
the
kangaroo
rat
only
a
little
horsehair
can
do
that
surely
the
prisoner
can
imagine
the
judge
is
a
cockatoo
without
our
having
to
wait
for
the
horsehair
let
get
on
with
the
trial
this
idea
was
received
with
applause
and
the
swallow
flew
off
in
a
huff
whilst
the
kookooburra
on
a
tree
near
the
court
softly
laughed
to
himself
once
more
the
pelican
took
up
his
position
to
open
the
trial
the
cockatoo
puffed
himself
out
as
big
as
he
could
fluffed
out
his
cheek
feathers
and
half
closed
his
eyes
his
solemnly
attentive
attitude
won
the
admiration
of
all
the
court
and
the
absence
of
horsehair
was
not
felt
by
anyone
the
welcome
swallow
having
got
over
its
ill
temper
returned
to
help
the
proceedings
and
the
jury
all
put
their
heads
under
their
wings
and
went
to
sleep
fire
away
screamed
the
cockatoo
and
the
trial
began
my
duty
is
a
most
painful
one
said
the
pelican
for
whereas
said
the
swallow
the
prisoner
known
named
and
described
added
the
swallow
as
dot
is
now
before
you
to
be
tried
heard
determined
and
adjudged
gabbled
the
swallow
on
a
charge
of
cruelty
and
feloniously
killing
and
slaying
prompted
the
swallow
to
birds
and

in

breath
the

quoting
the
cruelty

act
she
is
hereby
put
in
the
swallow
brought
to
trial
on
divers
whispered
the
swallow
charges
hereinafter
said
the
swallow
to
be
named
and
described
by
the
aforesaid
interjected
the
swallow
birds
and
animals
hereinbefore
mentioned
stated
the
swallow
the
said
animals
being
denizens
of
the
bush
and
in
no
wise
relating
to

ox
began
the
swallow
again
when
the
cockatoo
raised
his
crest
and
screamed
out
stop
that
i
tell
you
and
the
pelican
continued
stating
the
charge
bush
law
enacts
said
the
swallow
that
whereas
prompted
the
swallow
all
individual
rights
whatsoever
put
in
the
swallow
shall
be
according
to
the
statute
victoria
victoria
twenty
to
one
against
the
field
shouted
the
judge
between
you
two
said
the
pelican
looking
angrily
at
the
swallow
and
the
cockatoo
i
forgotten
everything
i
was
going
to
say
i
sha
go
on
never
mind
said
the
swallow
cheerfully
you
said
quite
enough
and
no
one
has
understood
a
word
of
the
charge
so
it
all
right
now
then
for
the
witnesses
as
the
swallow
spoke
there
was
a
great
disturbance
amongst
the
creatures
the
swan
ducks
cranes
and
waterfowl
besides
honeysuckers
and
many
other
birds
were
all
fanning
the
air
with
their
wings
and
crying
turn
him
out
disgusting
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
my
life
the
smell
of
it
always
gives
me
a
headache
and
there
was
such
a
noise
that
the
jury
all
woke
up
and
dot
covered
her
ears
with
her
hands
the
cockatoo
seeing
dot
distress
at
the
screams
and
hubbub
and
thinking
that
she
wanted
to
say
something
but
could
not
make
herself
heard
in
the
general
riot
decided
to
speak
for
her
so
he
screamed
louder
than
all
the
rest
and
shouted
apples
oranges
pears
lemonade
cigarettes
cigars
i
say
what
the
row
illustration
the
pelican
opens
the
case
when
quiet
was
restored
it
was
explained
that
the
opossum
had
brought
into
court
a
pouch
full
of
gum
leaves
which
it
was
eating
it
had
also
given
some
to
the
native
bear
and
wallaby
and
in
consequence
the
whole
air
was
laden
with
the
odour
of
eucalyptus
oh
dear
said
dot
it
smells
just
like
when
i
have
a
cold
eating
eucalyptus
leaves
in
court
is
contempt
of
court
cried
the
swallow
and
everyone
echoed
contempt
of
court
contempt
of
court
turn
them
out
but
they
are
witnesses
objected
the
pelican
that
does
matter
shouted
the
waterfowl
it
a
disgusting
smell
turn
them
out
hurrah
shouted
the
wallaby
as
it
leaped
off
what
luck
laughed
the
opossum
as
it
cleared
into
the
nearest
tree
i
am
glad
sighed
the
koala
as
it
slowly
moved
away
that
trial
made
my
head
feel
empty
well
there
go
three
of
the
most
important
witnesses
grumbled
the
pelican
my
eye
what
a
spree
said
the
judge
a
galah
amongst
the
jury
wishing
to
be
thought
intelligent
enquired
what
charge
the
wallaby
native
bear
and
opossum
were
to
bear
witness
to
it
is
a
matter
of
skins
included
in
the
fur
rugs
clause
and
the
wickedness
known
as
answered
the
pelican
whilst
the
pelican
was
making
this
explanation
the
judge
who
had
been
longing
to
have
his
poll
scratched
again
sidled
up
to
dot
and
whispered
softly
to
her
scratch
cockie
but
just
as
he
was
enjoying
the
delicious
sensation
dot
fingers
produced
amongst
his
neck
feathers
as
he
held
his
head
down
the
pelican
caught
sight
of
the
proceeding
the
pelican
said
nothing
but
stared
at
the
judge
with
an
eye
of
such
astonishment
and
stern
contempt
that
the
cockatoo
instantly
remembered
that
he
was
a
judge
and
getting
into
a
proper
attitude
said
hastily
advance
australia
who
the
next
witness
and
again
the
kookooburra
laughed
to
himself
on
the
tree
fur
first
exclaimed
a
white
ibis
call
the
platypus
the
platypus
wo
come
cried
the
kangaroo
rat
well
i
never
exclaimed
the
judge
it
says
that
if
a
court
is
held
at
all
it
should
be
conducted
by
the
representative
of
antediluvian
custom
the
most
ancient
and
learned
creatures
such
as
the
iguana
the
snake
and
ornithorhynchus
paradoxus
that
it
would
prefer
to
associate
with
the
meanest
troglodite
rather
than
appear
amongst
the
present
company
i
understood
it
to
say
continued
the
kangaroo
rat
that
real
law
could
only
be
understood
by
those
deeply
learned
in
fossils
my
word
ejaculated
the
judge
shiver
my
timbers
what
blooming
impudence
oh
you
naughty
bird
to
use
such
words
exclaimed
dot
but
all
the
court
murmured
how
clever
and
the
cockatoo
was
pleased
native
cat
next
shouted
the
white
ibis
but
at
the
first
mention
of
the
native
cat
nearly
every
bird
and
all
the
small
game
prepared
to
get
away
why
do
you
call
the
dingo
at
once
laughed
the
kookooburra
who
was
really
keeping
guard
over
dot
although
she
did
not
know
it
humans
kill
dingoes
the
dingo
the
dingo
every
creature
repeated
in
horror
and
consternation
and
they
all
looked
about
in
fear
while
the
kookooburra
chuckled
to
himself
at
all
the
stir
his
words
had
made
it
quite
true
that
animals
and
birds
kill
one
another
said
the
magpie
who
thought
he
ought
to
say
something
in
dot
defence
as
that
was
his
part
in
the
trial
therefore
it
is
the
same
nature
that
makes
humans
kill
us
if
it
is
the
nature
of
humans
to
kill
the
same
as
it
is
the
nature
of
birds
and
animals
to
kill
where
is
the
sense
and
justice
of
trying
the
prisoner
for
what
she
ca
help
doing
good
said
the
welcome
swallow
argued
like
a
lawyer
at
this
unexpected
turn
of
the
trial
the
judge
softly
whistled
to
himself
pop
goes
the
weasel
do
talk
to
us
about
nature
and
justice
and
sense
replied
the
pelican
contemptuously
this
is
a
court
of
law
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
them
the
court
all
cheered
at
this
reply
and
the
magpie
subsided
in
the
sulks
call
the
kangaroo
cried
the
white
ibis
it
no
good
jeered
the
kookooburra
kangaroo
and
dot
are
great
friends
she
wo
come
if
you
called
all
blue
interrupted
the
judge
and
he
went
on
with
pop
goes
the
weasel
this
news
caused
a
buzz
of
excitement
everyone
was
astounded
that
the
kangaroo
who
had
the
heaviest
grievances
of
all
would
appear
against
the
prisoner
is
it
possible
said
the
pelican
addressing
the
kookooburra
in
slow
stern
accents
is
it
possible
that
the
kangaroo
has
forgiven
all
her
grievances
all
said
the
kookooburra
the
hunting
asked
the
pelican
yes
answered
the
kookooburra
the
rugs
yes
the
boots
yes
and
said
the
pelican
still
more
solemnly
and
slowly
while
all
the
court
listened
in
breathless
attention
and
has
she
forgiven
yes
she
forgiven
that
too
answered
the
kookooburra
cheerfully
then
said
the
pelican
hotly
i
throw
up
the
case
and
he
spread
his
huge
black
wings
and
flapped
his
way
up
into
the
sky
and
away
what
a
go
said
the
judge
and
he
might
have
said
more
only
dot
could
not
hear
anything
on
account
of
the
racket
and
confusion
the
trial
had
failed
and
every
creature
was
making
all
the
noise
it
could
and
preparing
to
hurry
away
in
the
middle
of
the
turmoil
dot
kangaroo
bounded
into
the
open
space
panting
with
excitement
and
delight
dot
dot
she
cried
i
found
willy
wagtail
and
he
knows
your
way
come
along
at
once
and
putting
dot
in
her
pouch
the
kangaroo
leaped
clean
over
the
judge
and
carried
her
off
chapter
xii
although
the
kangaroo
was
longing
to
hear
the
reason
why
so
many
bush
creatures
had
collected
round
dot
whilst
she
was
away
she
was
too
anxious
to
carry
her
to
willy
wagtail
before
nightfall
to
wait
and
enquire
what
had
happened
dot
too
was
so
excited
at
hearing
that
her
way
home
had
been
found
that
she
could
only
think
of
the
delight
of
seeing
her
father
and
mother
again
so
the
kangaroo
had
hopped
until
she
was
tired
and
needed
rest
before
they
spoke
then
dot
described
the
trial
and
made
the
kangaroo
laugh
about
the
cockatoo
judge
but
she
did
not
say
how
it
had
all
ended
because
the
kangaroo
had
forgiven
dot
for
humans
making
rugs
of
her
fur
boots
of
her
skin
and
soup
of
her
tail
she
was
afraid
of
hurting
her
feelings
by
mentioning
such
delicate
subjects
the
kangaroo
never
noticed
that
anything
was
left
out
because
she
was
bursting
to
relate
her
interview
with
willy
wagtail
she
told
dot
how
she
had
found
willy
wagtail
near
his
old
haunt
how
that
gossiping
little
bird
had
told
all
the
news
of
the
gabblebabble
town
and
district
in
ten
minutes
and
how
he
had
said
he
believed
he
knew
dot
by
sight
and
that
if
such
were
the
case
he
would
show
dot
and
the
kangaroo
the
way
to
the
little
girl
home
then
dot
and
the
kangaroo
hurried
on
their
way
again
the
little
girl
sometimes
running
and
walking
to
rest
the
kind
animal
and
sometimes
being
carried
in
that
soft
cosy
pouch
that
had
been
her
cradle
and
carriage
for
all
those
days
it
was
quite
dusk
by
the
time
they
arrived
at
a
fence
and
heard
a
little
bird
singing
sweet
pretty
creature
sweet
pretty
creature
that
is
willy
wagtail
making
love
said
the
kangaroo
with
a
humorous
twinkle
in
her
quiet
eyes
peep
round
the
bush
she
said
to
dot
and
you
see
them
spooning
illustration
the
kangaroo
carries
dot
out
of
court
dot
glanced
through
the
branches
and
saw
two
wagtails
who
looked
very
smart
with
their
black
coats
and
white
waistcoats
sitting
on
two
posts
of
the
fence
a
little
way
off
they
were
each
pretending
that
their
long
big
tails
were
too
heavy
to
balance
them
properly
and
they
seemed
to
be
always
just
saving
themselves
from
toppling
off
their
perch
occasionally
willy
would
dart
into
the
air
to
show
what
an
expert
in
flying
he
was
he
would
shoot
straight
upwards
turn
a
double
somersault
backwards
and
wing
off
in
the
direction
one
least
expected
afterwards
he
would
return
to
his
post
as
calm
and
cool
as
if
he
had
done
nothing
surprising
and
say
pretty
pretty
that
name
meaning
the
other
wagtail
then
showed
off
flying
and
they
both
said
to
one
another
sweet
pretty
creature
at
the
sound
of
dot
and
the
kangaroo
approach
hid
herself
in
a
tree
and
willy
wagtail
not
knowing
who
was
disturbing
them
scolded
angrily
but
when
he
saw
the
kangaroo
and
the
little
girl
he
gave
them
the
most
cordial
greeting
and
wobbled
about
on
a
rail
as
if
he
must
tumble
off
every
second
this
is
dot
said
the
kangaroo
a
little
anxiously
and
rather
breathless
with
the
speed
she
had
made
just
as
i
had
expected
exclaimed
willy
wagtail
with
a
jerk
of
his
tail
which
nearly
sent
him
headlong
off
the
rail
i
should
know
you
anywhere
little
human
though
you
do
look
a
bit
different
you
want
preening
he
added
this
last
remark
was
in
allusion
to
dot
appearance
which
certainly
was
most
untidy
and
dirty
for
beyond
an
occasional
lick
from
the
kangaroo
she
had
been
five
days
without
being
tidied
and
cleaned
i
could
do
it
better
said
the
kangaroo
apologetically
it
does
matter
at
all
said
dot
putting
her
tangled
curls
back
from
her
eyes
well
i
know
where
you
live
gabbled
off
the
wagtail
it
the
second
big
paddock
from
here
if
you
follow
the
belt
of
the
sheoak
trees
over
there
it
a
house
just
like
those
things
in
gabblebabble
township
there
a
yellow
sheep
dog
who
very
good
tempered
and
a
black
one
that
made
a
snap
at
my
tail
the
other
day
there
is
an
old
grey
cart
horse
an
honest
fellow
but
rather
dull
and
a
bay
mare
who
is
much
better
company
there
is
a
little
red
cow
who
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
she
had
a
calf
a
few
days
before
you
were
lost
dear
me
exclaimed
the
gossiping
bird
what
a
fuss
there
has
been
these
five
days
over
trying
to
find
you
i
been
over
there
every
day
to
see
the
sight
such
a
lot
of
humans
and
such
horses
i
enjoyed
myself
immensely
and
made
a
lot
of
friends
amongst
the
horses
but
i
did
care
so
much
for
the
dogs
i
thought
them
a
nasty
quarrelsome
lot
i
went
with
the
whole
turnout
to
see
the
search
goodness
the
distances
they
went
and
the
noise
and
the
big
fires
they
made
it
exciting
fun
they
brought
over
some
black
humans
is
what
they
are
called
at
least
the
mounted
troopers
horses
told
me
so
my
word
the
troopers
horses
are
jolly
fellows
well
these
black
trackers
went
in
front
of
each
party
just
like
dogs
with
their
heads
to
the
ground
and
they
turned
over
every
leaf
and
twig
and
said
if
a
human
a
horse
or
a
kangaroo
had
broken
it
or
been
that
way
they
found
your
track
fast
enough
but
one
evening
it
came
to
an
end
quite
suddenly
and
were
they
all
surprised
i
heard
from
a
horse
such
a
nice
horse
he
was
that
the
trackers
and
white
humans
said
it
was
just
as
if
you
had
disappeared
into
the
sky
there
was
just
a
bit
of
your
fur
on
a
bush
and
nothing
anywhere
else
but
a
trail
no
one
could
make
it
out
that
was
when
i
took
you
in
my
pouch
exclaimed
the
kangaroo
now
said
the
wagtail
most
of
them
have
given
up
the
search
just
this
evening
dot
father
and
a
few
other
humans
came
back
and
the
yellow
sheep
dog
told
me
the
last
big
party
is
to
start
at
noon
and
after
that
there
will
be
no
more
attempt
to
find
dot
only
the
sheep
dog
said
he
heard
his
master
say
he
would
go
on
hunting
alone
until
he
found
her
body
i
have
been
over
there
wound
up
the
bird
they
are
all
so
miserable
and
tired
it
gave
me
the
blues
yesterday
what
are
we
to
do
it
is
quite
dark
and
late
asked
the
kangaroo
you
had
better
stay
here
counselled
the
wagtail
one
night
more
or
less
does
matter
and
i
do
like
leaving
at
she
likes
me
to
sing
to
her
all
night
because
she
is
nervous
i
will
go
with
you
morning
early
if
you
will
wait
here
until
then
having
found
your
lost
way
so
far
said
the
kangaroo
to
dot
it
would
be
a
pity
to
risk
losing
it
again
so
we
had
better
wait
for
willy
wagtail
to
guide
us
to
tell
the
truth
the
kangaroo
was
very
glad
of
the
excuse
to
keep
dot
one
night
more
before
parting
from
her
it
will
seem
like
losing
my
little
joey
again
when
i
am
once
more
alone
she
said
sadly
but
you
will
never
go
far
away
said
dot
i
should
cry
if
i
thought
you
would
never
come
to
see
me
you
will
live
on
our
selection
you
but
the
kangaroo
looked
very
doubtful
and
said
that
she
loved
dot
but
she
was
afraid
of
humans
and
their
dogs
illustration
dot
father
about
to
shoot
the
kangaroo
after
a
supper
of
berries
and
grass
dot
and
the
kangaroo
lay
down
for
the
night
in
a
little
bower
of
bushes
but
they
talked
until
very
late
of
how
they
were
to
manage
to
reach
dot
home
without
danger
from
guns
and
dogs
at
last
when
they
tried
to
sleep
they
could
not
do
so
on
account
of
willy

singing
to
his
sweetheart
sweet
pretty
creature
sweet
pretty
creature
without
stopping
for
more
than
five
minutes
at
a
time
i
wonder
does
get
tired
of
that
song
said

never
does

never

singing

chapter
xiii
two
men
were
walking
near
a
cottage
in
the
winter
sunlight
of
the
early
morning
there
came
to
the
door
a
young
woman
who
looked
pale
and
tired
she
carried
a
bowl
of
milk
to
a
little
calf
and
on
her
way
back
to
the
cottage
she
paused
and
shading
her
eyes
that
were
red
with
weeping
lingered
awhile
looking
far
and
near
then
with
a
sigh
she
returned
indoors
and
worked
restlessly
at
her
household
duties
it
breaks
my
heart
to
see
my
wife
do
that
said
the
taller
man
who
carried
a
gun
all
day
long
she
comes
out
and
looks
for
the
child
one
knows
now
that
the
poor
little
one
can
never
come
back
to
us
and
as
the
big
man
spoke
there
was
a
queer
choking
in
his
voice
the
younger
man
did
not
speak
but
he
patted
his
friend
shoulder
in
a
kindly
manner
which
showed
that
he
too
was
very
sorry
even
you
have
lost
heart
jack
said
the
big
bushman
but
we
shall
find
her
yet
the
wife
shall
have
that
comfort
you
never
do
it
now
said
the
young
fellow
with
a
mournful
shake
of
the
head
there
is
not
an
inch
of
ground
that
so
young
a
child
could
reach
that
we
have
not
searched
the
mystery
is
what
could
have
become
of
her
that
what
beats
me
said
the
tall
man
who
was
dot
father
i
think
of
it
all
day
and
all
night
there
is
the
track
of
the
dear
little
mite
as
clear
as
possible
for
five
miles
as
far
as
the
dry
creek
the
trackers
say
she
rested
her
poor
weary
legs
by
sitting
under
the
blackbutt
tree
at
that
point
she
vanishes
completely
the
blacks
say
there
is
a
trace
of
man
or
beast
beyond
that
place
excepting
the
trail
of
a
big
kangaroo
as
you
say
it
a
mystery
as
the
men
walked
towards
the
bush
close
to
the
place
where
dot
had
run
after
the
hare
the
day
she
was
lost
neither
of
them
noticed
the
fuss
and
scolding
made
by
a
willy
wagtail
although
the
little
bird
seemed
likely
to
die
of
excitement
willy
wagtail
was
really
saying
dot
and
her
kangaroo
are
coming
this
way
whatever
you
do
do
shoot
them
with
that
gun
presently
the
young
man
jack
noticed
the
little
bird
what
friendly
little
chaps
those
wagtails
are
he
said
and
see
how
tame
and
fearless
this
one
is
upon
my
word
he
nearly
flew
in
your
face
that
time
illustration
dot
waving
adieu
to
the
kangaroo
dot
father
did
not
notice
the
remark
for
he
had
stopped
suddenly
and
was
peering
into
the
bush
whilst
he
quietly
shifted
his
gun
into
position
ready
to
raise
it
and
fire
by
jove
he
said
i
saw
the
head
of
a
kangaroo
a
moment
ago
behind
that
fancy
it
coming
so
near
the
house
next
time
it
shows
i
get
a
shot
at
it
both
men
waited
for
the
moment
when
the
kangaroo
should
be
seen
again
the
next
instant
the
kangaroo
bounded
out
of
the
bush
into
the
open
paddock
swift
as
lightning
up
went
the
cruel
gun
but
as
it
exploded
with
a
terrible
report
the
man
jack
struck
it
upwards
and
the
fatal
bullet
lodged
in
the
branch
of
a
tall
gum
tree
great
scott
exclaimed
jack
pointing
at
the
kangaroo
dot
cried
her
father
dropping
his
gun
and
stumbling
blindly
forward
with
outstretched
arms
towards
his
little
girl
who
had
just
tumbled
out
of
the
kangaroo
pouch
in
her
hurry
to
reach
her
father
hoo
hoo
ho
ho
he
he
ha
ha
ha
ha
laughed
a
kookooburra
on
a
tree
as
he
saw
dot
clasped
in
her
father
great
strong
arms
and
the
little
face
hidden
in
his
big
brown
beard
wife
wife
shouted
dot
father
dot
come
back
dot
come
back
dot
here
yelled
the
young
man
as
he
ran
like
mad
to
the
house
and
all
the
time
the
good
kangaroo
sat
up
on
her
haunches
still
panting
with
fear
from
the
sound
of
the
gun
and
a
little
afraid
to
stay
yet
so
interested
in
all
the
excitement
and
delight
that
she
could
make
up
her
mind
to
hop
away
dadda
said
dot
you
nearly
killed
dot
and
her
kangaroo
oh
if
killed
my
kangaroo
i
never
have
been
happy
any
more
but
i
do
understand
said
her
father
how
did
you
come
to
be
in
the
kangaroo
pouch
oh
i
got
lots
and
lots
to
tell
you
said
dot
but
come
and
stroke
dear
kangaroo
who
saved
little
dot
and
brought
her
home
that
i
will

dot
father
and
never
more

i
hurt
a
kangaroo
nor
any
of
the
bush
creatures
said
dot
promise
dadda
i
promise
said
the
big
man
in
a
voice
as
he
kissed
dot
over
and
over
again
and
walked
towards
the
frightened
animal
dot
wriggled
down
from
her
father
arms
and
said
to
the
kangaroo
it
all
right
no
one
ever
going
to
be
shot
or
hurt
here
again
and
the
kangaroo
looked
delighted
at
the
good
news
dadda
said
dot
holding
her
father
hand
and
with
her
disengaged
hand
touching
the
kangaroo
little
paw
this
is
my
own
dear
kangaroo
dot
father
not
knowing
quite
how
to
show
his
gratitude
stroked
the
kangaroo
head
and
said
how
do
you
do
which
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
afterwards
seemed
rather
a
foolish
thing
to
say
but
he
used
like
dot
to
talking
to
bush
creatures
and
had
not
eaten
the
berries
of
understanding
the
kangaroo
saw
that
dot
father
was
grateful
and
so
she
was
pleased
but
she
did
not
like
to
be
stroked
by
a
man
who
let
off
guns
so
she
was
glad
that
dot
mother
had
run
to
where
they
were
standing
and
was
hugging
and
kissing
the
little
girl
and
crying
all
the
time
for
then
dot
father
turned
and
watched
his
wife
and
child
and
kept
doing
something
to
his
eyes
with
a
handkerchief
so
that
there
was
no
attention
to
spare
for
kangaroos
the
good
kangaroo
seeing
how
happy
these
people
were
and
knowing
that
her
life
was
quite
safe
wanted
to
peep
about
dot
home
and
see
what
it
was
like
for
kangaroos
ca
help
being
curious
so
presently
she
quietly
hopped
off
towards
the
cottage
and
then
a
very
strange
thing
happened
just
as
the
kangaroo
was
wondering
what
the
great
iron
tank
by
the
kitchen
door
was
meant
for
there
popped
out
of
the
open
door
a
joey
kangaroo
now
to
human
beings
all
joey
kangaroos
look
alike
but
amongst
kangaroos
there
are
no
two
the
same
and
dot
kangaroo
at
once
recognised
in
the
little
joey
her
own
baby
kangaroo
the
joey
knew
its
mother
directly
and
whilst
dot
kangaroo
was
too
astonished
to
move
and
not
being
able
to
think
was
trying
to
get
at
a
conclusion
why
her
joey
was
coming
out
of
a
cottage
the
little
kangaroo
with
a
had
landed
itself
comfortably
in
the
nice
pouch
dot
had
just
vacated
then
dot
mother
rejoicing
over
the
safe
return
of
her
little
girl
was
not
more
happy
than
the
kangaroo
with
her
joey
once
more
in
her
pouch
with
big
bounds
she
leapt
towards
dot
and
the
little
girl
suddenly
looking
round
for
her
kangaroo
friend
clapped
her
hands
with
delight
as
she
saw
a
little
grey
nose
a
pair
of
tiny
black
paws
and
the
point
of
a
little
black
tail
hanging
out
of
the
pouch
that
had
carried
her
so
often
why
exclaimed
dot
mother
if
she
has
got
the
little
joey
jack
brought
me
yesterday
he
picked
it
up
after
a
kangaroo
hunt
some
time
ago
it
her
joey
her
lost
joey
cried
dot
running
to
the
kangaroo
oh
dear
kangaroo
i
am
so
glad
she
said
for
now
we
are
all
happy
as
happy
as
can
be
dot
hugged
her
kangaroo
and
kissed
the
little
joey
and
they
all
three
talked
together
so
that
none
of
them
understood
what
the
others
were
saying
only
that
they
were
all
much
pleased
and
delighted
wife
said
dot
father
i
tell
you
what
mighty
queer
our
little
girl
is
talking
away
to
those
animals
and
they
all
understanding
one
another
as
if
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
treat
kangaroos
as
if
they
were
human
beings
i
expect
said
his
wife
that
their
feelings
are
not
much
different
from
ours
see
how
that
poor
animal
is
rejoicing
in
getting
back
its
little
one
just
as
we
are
over
having
our
little
dot
again
to
think
of
all
the
poor
things
i
have
killed
said
dot
father
sadly
i
never
do
it
again
no
said
his
wife
we
must
try
and
get
everyone
to
be
kind
to
the
bush
creatures
and
protect
them
all
we
can
this
book
would
never
come
to
an
end
if
it
told
all
that
passed
that
day
how
dot
explained
the
wonderful
power
of
the
berries
of
understanding
and
how
she
told
the
kangaroos
all
that
her
parents
wanted
her
to
say
on
their
behalf
and
what
kind
things
the
kangaroo
said
in
return
all
day
long
the
kangaroo
stayed
near
dot
home
and
the
little
girl
persuaded
her
to
eat
bread
which
she
said
was
most
delicious
but
one
would
get
tired
of
it
sooner
than
of
grass
every
effort
was
made
by
dot
and
her
parents
to
get
the
kangaroo
to
live
on
their
selection
so
that
they
might
protect
her
from
harm
but
she
said
that
she
liked
her
own
free
life
best
only
she
would
never
go
far
away
and
would
come
often
to
see
dot
at
sunset
she
said
to
dot
a
little
sadly
and
the
child
stood
in
the
rosy
light
of
the
afterglow
waving
her
hand
as
she
saw
her
kind
animal
friend
hop
away
and
disappear
into
the
dark
shadow
of
the
bush
she
wandered
about
for
some
time
listening
to
the
voices
of
birds
and
creatures
who
came
to
tell
her
how
glad
everyone
was
that
her
way
had
been
found
and
that
no
harm
was
to
befall
them
in
future
the
news
of
her
safe
return
and
of
the
kangaroo
finding
her
joey
had
been
spread
far
and
near
by
willy
wagtail
and
the
kookooburra
and
she
could
hear
the
shouts
of
laughter
from
kookooburras
telling
the
story
until
nearly
dark
quite
late
at
night
she
was
visited
by
the
opossum
the
native
bear
and
the
nightjar
who
entered
by
the
open
window
and
sitting
in
the
moonlight
conversed
about
the
day
events
they
said
that
their
whole
rest
and
sleep
had
been
disturbed
by
the
noise
and
excitement
of
the
day
creatures
spreading
the
news
through
the
bush
the
wished
to
sing
a
sad
song
because
dot
was
feeling
happy
but
the
opossum
warned
it
that
it
was
sitting
in
a
draught
on
the
window
sill
and
might
spoil
its
beautiful
voice
so
it
flew
away
and
only
sang
in
the
distance
the
native
bear
said
that
the
story
of
dot
return
and
the
finding
of
kangaroo
joey
was
so
strange
that
it
made
its
head
feel
quite
empty
the
opossum
inspected
everything
in
dot
room
and
tried
to
fight
itself
in
the
it
then
got
the
koala
to
look
into
the
mirror
also
and
said
it
would
get
an
idea
into
its
little
empty
head
if
it
did
when
the
koala
had
taken
a
timid
peep
at
itself
the
opossum
said
that
the
koala
now
had
an
idea
of
how
stupid
it
looked
and
the
little
bear
went
off
to
get
used
to
having
an
idea
in
its
head
the
opossum
was
so
pleased
with
its
spiteful
joke
that
it
hastily
said
good
night
and
hurried
away
to
tell
it
to
the
other
gradually
the
voices
of
the
creatures
outside
became
more
and
more
faint
and
indistinct
and
then
dot
slept
in
the
grey
light
of
the
dawn
when
she
went
out
in
the
morning
the
kookooburras
were
gurgling
and
laughing
the
magpies
were
warbling
the
parrakeets
made
their
twittering
and
willy
wagtail
was
most
lively
but
dot
was
astonished
to
find
that
she
could
not
understand
what
any
of
the
creatures
said
although
they
were
all
very
friendly
towards
her
when
the
kangaroo
came
to
see
her
she
made
signs
that
she
wanted
some
berries
of
understanding
but
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
kangaroo
pretended
not
to
understand
dot
has
often
wondered
why
the
kangaroo
would
not
understand
but
remembering
what
that
considerate
animal
had
said
when
she
first
gave
her
the
berries
she
is
inclined
to
think
that
the
kangaroo
is
afraid
of
her
learning
too
much
and
thereby
getting
indigestion
dot
and
her
parents
have
often
sought
for
the
berries
but
up
to
now
they
have
failed
to
find
them
there
is
something
very
mysterious
about
those
berries
during
that
day
every
creature
dot
had
known
in
the
bush
came
to
see
her
for
they
all
knew
that
their
lives
were
safe
now
so
they
were
not
afraid
it
greatly
surprised
dot
parents
to
see
such
numbers
of
birds
and
animals
coming
around
their
little
girl
and
they
thought
it
very
pretty
when
in
the
evening
a
flock
of
native
companions
settled
down
and
danced
their
graceful
dance
with
the
little
girl
joining
in
the
game
it
seems
to
me
wife
said
dot
father
with
a
glad
laugh
that
the
place
has
become
a
regular
menagerie
illustration
by
the
lake
evening
later
on
dot
father
made
a
dam
on
a
hollow
piece
of
ground
near
the
house
which
soon
became
full
of
water
and
is
surrounded
by
beautiful
willow
trees
there
all
the
thirsty
creatures
come
to
drink
in
safety
and
very
pretty
it
is
to
sit
on
the
verandah
of
that
happy
home
and
see
dot
playing
near
the
water
surrounded
by
her
bush
friends
who
come
and
go
as
they
please
and
play
with
the
little
girl
beside
the
pretty
lake
and
no
one
in
all
the
gabblebabble
district
hurts
a
bush
creature
because
they
are
all
called
dot
friends
finale
before
putting
away
the
pen
and
closing
the
inkstand
now
that
dot
has
said
all
she
wishes
to
be
recorded
of
her
bewildering
adventures
the
writer
would
like
to
warn
little
people
that
the
best
thing
to
do
when
one
is
lost
in
the
bush
is
to
sit
still
in
one
place
and
not
to
try
to
find
one
way
home
at
all
if
dot
had
done
this
and
had
not
gone
off
in
the
kangaroo
pouch
she
would
have
been
found
almost
directly
as
the
more
one
tries
to
find
one
way
home
the
more
one
gets
lost
and
as
helpful
kangaroos
like
dot
are
very
scarce
the
best
way
to
get
found
quickly
is
to
wait
in
one
place
until
the
search
parties
find
one
do
forget
this
advice
and
do
eat
any
strange
berries
in
the
bush
unless
a
kangaroo
brings
them
to
you
