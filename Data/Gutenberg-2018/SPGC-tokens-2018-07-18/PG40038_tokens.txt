chapter
i
the
basin
in
a
remote
basin
in
the
western
part
of
texas
the
cavendish
clan
raised
cattle
from
the
vast
level
acreage
where
longhorns
grew
fat
on
lush
grass
the
surrounding
hills
looked
verdant
and
hospitable
but
this
was
pure
deceit
on
nature
part
those
hills
were
treacherous
and
bryant
cavendish
loved
them
for
that
selfsame
treachery
sitting
on
the
porch
of
his
rambling
house
the
bitter
old
man
spat
curses
at
the
infirmities
that
restricted
him
his
legs
tortured
by
rheumatism
were
propped
on
a
bentwood
chair
and
seemed
slim
and
out
of
proportion
to
his
torso
his
eyes
like
caves
beneath
an
overhanging
ledge
were
more
restless
than
usual
as
he
gazed
across
the
basin
he
rasped
a
heavy
thumbnail
across
the
bristle
of
his
slablike
jowl
there
was
something
in
the
air
he
could
explain
he
felt
a
vague
uneasiness
despite
the
almost
pastoral
scene
before
him
he
scanned
the
hills
on
all
sides
of
the
basin
knowing
that
no
stranger
could
come
through
the
tangle
of
underbrush
and
dense
forest
those
hills
had
always
been
practically
impassable
then
his
restless
eyes
fell
on
the
weird
riot
of
color
to
the
north
that
was
bryant
gap
water
flowing
from
the
basin
springs
had
patiently
through
countless
ages
cut
the
deep
cleft
in
solid
rock
the
walls
towering
high
on
each
side
reflected
unbelievable
hues
scowl
deepened
as
he
observed
the
gap
he
could
see
but
a
few
yards
into
it
and
then
it
turned
and
his
view
ended
abruptly
on
a
rainbow
wall
that
wall
had
often
reminded
cavendish
of
a
rattler
beautiful
but
dangerous
if
it
uz
only
straight
he
growled
i
c
see
when
someone
comes
this
way
but
the
damn
canyon
is
as
fickle
as
a
wench
disposition
once
more
his
finger
scraped
across
the
beard
cavendish
had
survived
a
good
many
years
there
in
the
west
he
had
risen
above
the
many
forms
of
sudden
death
to
know
an
old
age
of
comparative
security
but
like
men
in
that
region
where
eternal
vigilance
was
the
price
of
safety
his
intuition
was
developed
to
a
high
degree
in
a
poker
game
he
played
his
hunches
and
in
life
he
listened
to
that
sixth
sense
somethin
he
decided
is
goin
on
in
that
gap
as
sure
as
sittin
here
as
if
to
echo
his
words
a
distant
rumble
reached
his
ears
it
came
from
the
gap
at
first
he
thought
it
must
be
another
of
the
frequent
storms
he
listened
then
his
face
grew
harder
than
before
his
jaw
set
firmly
that
ai
thunder
he
muttered
that
gunplay
his
first
impulse
was
to
call
for
some
of
the
men
to
investigate
instead
he
listened
for
a
moment
his
niece
penelope
could
be
heard
humming
a
gay
tune
inside
the
house
she
at
least
had
not
heard
anything
unusual
bryant
knew
his
eyes
were
failing
him
of
late
and
he
began
to
doubt
his
ears
perhaps
after
all
it
might
have
been
thunder
would
do
to
start
a
lot
of
commotion
over
nothing
at
all
must
let
the
boys
know
how
the
old
man
slipping
he
struggled
to
his
feet
and
his
weight
by
gripping
the
back
of
a
chair
moved
to
the
end
of
the
porch
and
looked
toward
the
south
where
two
of
his
nephews
stood
idly
smoking
near
a
corral
his
lips
moved
with
unuttered
comments
when
he
saw
the
men
scowling
he
made
his
painful
way
back
to
the
chair
must
been
mistaken
he
muttered
there
was
no
proof
that
bryant
cavendish
did
not
like
his
relatives
on
the
other
hand
he
never
had
shown
affection
for
them
that
unusual
because
he
never
had
cared
particularly
about
anyone
his
bitter
outlook
on
life
made
him
feel
that
affection
and
softness
went
hand
in
hand
he
had
lost
all
respect
for
his
two
brothers
when
they
married
the
fact
that
bryant
had
outlived
them
both
proved
to
his
own
satisfaction
which
was
all
that
mattered
that
marriage
and
the
problems
of
the
benedict
make
men
die
young
one
brother
had
left
four
sons
the
other
a
daughter
bryant
the
last
of
his
generation
had
raised
the
brood
his
domination
cowed
the
boys
but
penelope
escaped
an
inherent
sense
of
humor
saved
the
girl
when
penny
left
for
an
eastern
school
in
accordance
with
the
written
will
of
her
foresighted
father
she
was
without
a
trace
of
the
sullen
subservient
manner
that
marked
her
cousins
bryant
frowned
on
the
idea
of
sending
the
girl
to
school
to
him
it
seemed
a
waste
of
time
and
money
but
he
followed
the
terms
of
his
brother
will
with
meticulous
care
superlatives
can
not
be
used
in
connection
with
the
boys
of
the
second
generation
of
cavendishes
so
instead
of
stating
that
mort
was
the
most
courageous
it
is
more
accurate
to
record
that
jeb
vince
and
wallie
were
even
less
courageous
than
mort
it
was
mort
who
as
a
pimpled
adolescent
suggested
meekly
that
he
and
his
brothers
leave
the
basin
it
took
three
days
for
the
flames
of
rage
that
exploded
from
bryant
cavendish
to
die
down
and
their
embers
smoldered
for
weeks
thereafter
it
took
several
years
for
mort
to
build
up
the
spunk
to
assert
himself
again
he
married
rebecca
and
brought
her
to
the
basin
the
hurricane
blasts
from
uncle
bryant
made
all
previous
cavendish
tirades
seem
like
the
babblings
of
brooks
that
inspire
poets
bryant
was
an
old
man
and
even
his
iron
will
could
no
longer
ignore
the
rheumatism
that
made
his
legs
almost
useless
as
it
became
increasingly
necessary
for
the
nephews
to
assume
responsibility
his
resentment
toward
them
grew
proportionately

the
gap
the
lifeless
forms
that
littered
the
floor
of
bryant
gap
had
but
recently
been
men
who
lived
a
vital
hard
life
in
the
outdoors
men
who
could
shoot
fast
and
straight
whose
every
sense
was
tuned
to
a
pitch
that
made
them
aware
of
any
danger
that
lurked
the
dead
men
had
been
texas
rangers
in
a
roundabout
way
these
riders
had
been
told
that
men
they
sought
as
outlaws
could
be
found
in
bryant
basin
to
reach
the
basin
they
had
ridden
through
the
gap
almost
through
the
gap
but
death
had
cut
their
journey
short
killers
waiting
behind
protecting
rocks
had
fired
without
warning
half
of
the
small
band
had
spilled
from
the
saddle
either
dead
or
wounded
at
the
first
fusillade
of
bullets
the
others
with
the
intuitive
action
of
men
who
live
and
often
die
by
the
gun
had
leaped
to
the
ground
to
fight
from
behind
the
scant
protection
of
fallen
horses
empty
cartridge
cases
gave
mute
evidence
of
their
gallant
stand
the
rangers
all
had
fallen
but
in
one
a
tiny
spark
of
life
still
glowed
the
man
wounded
in
several
places
looked
dead
even
the
buzzards
circling
ever
lower
experts
at
recognizing
death
were
deceived
the
gaunt
birds
seemed
to
dart
away
in
surprise
when
the
lone
survivor
moved
a
dazed
sort
of
consciousness
came
slowly
to
him
at
first
he
was
aware
of
heat
heat
from
the
sun
overhead
and
the
rocks
surrounding
him
then
the
heat
became
a
frightful
burning
concentrated
in
his
right
leg
and
left
shoulder
blood
seeping
from
a
gash
across
his
forehead
blinded
him
he
tried
to
move
but
the
effort
made
him
giddy
he
fell
back
to
rest
while
he
fought
to
gather
his
scattered
senses
as
the
mists
lifted
from
his
mind
he
remembered
sudden
shots
his
comrades
falling
stabbing
pain
shooting
through
his
left
side
from
the
shoulder
down
left
hand
useless
a
bullet
in
his
foot
falling
to
the
ground
oblivion
ambush
treachery
live
must
bring
the
killers
in
sheer
courage
and
the
will
to
ignore
the
pains
that
racked
his
entire
body
brought
the
wounded
man
to
a
sitting
position
at
the
time
the
thought
that
murderers
might
still
be
lurking
close
at
hand
did
not
occur
to
him
his
first
thought
was
to
see
if
any
of
the
others
needed
help
but
when
he
tried
to
rise
he
was
amazed
at
his
own
weakness
he
realized
that
he
was
beyond
the
point
of
helping
others
he
could
barely
move
he
wiped
the
blood
from
his
eyes
but
his
vision
was
fogged
only
large
objects
could
be
discerned
and
these
not
clearly
he
tried
to
locate
the
horses
but
all
except
his
own
had
died
or
disappeared
the
white
stallion
that
he
himself
had
ridden
stood
a
short
distance
away
as
if
waiting
for
the
next
command
of
its
master
he
tried
to
give
the
familiar
whistle
but
no
sound
issued
from
his
dry
bloodless
lips
he
called
to
the
horse
and
his
own
voice
startled
him
it
was
an
unfamiliar
voice
one
that
he
had
never
heard
before
almost
croaking
but
the
stallion
heard
it
and
came
obediently
to
the
side
of
the
sitting
man
the
big
horse
lowered
its
head
at
a
whispered
command
the
reins
fell
close
to
the
hands
of
the
man
on
the
ground
he
clutched
for
them
and
had
to
grope
before
he
found
them
then
clinging
to
the
bridle
he
finally
gained
an
unsteady
footing
with
the
instinct
of
the
hunted
he
sought
for
his
means
of
defense
his
right
hand
fumbled
at
his
waist
for
the
familiar
cartridge
belt
and
the
brace
of
heavy
guns
the
belt
was
missing
this
discovery
should
have
been
cause
for
alarm
but
in
his
desperate
condition
the
loss
of
the
weapons
seemed
of
small
consequence
to
the
texas
ranger
he
did
however
wonder
vaguely
where
it
had
gone
he
could
remember
taking
the
belt
off
but
there
were
many
details
of
the
short
battle
that
had
escaped
his
recollection
he
felt
about
his
waist
once
more
before
he
would
believe
that
his
weapons
were
not
in
their
familiar
place
convinced
then
he
knew
that
but
one
hope
remained
flight
sensing
that
his
master
was
in
difficulty
knowing
that
something
unusual
had
taken
place
the
big
horse
stood
motionless
while
the
ranger
dragged
his
body
to
the
saddle
it
called
for
an
almost
superhuman
effort
to
mount
the
horse
he
made
no
attempt
to
sit
erect
instead
he
leaned
far
forward
fighting
desperately
against
the
constantly
increasing
nausea
that
threatened
to
deprive
him
of
consciousness
he
nudged
the
horse
with
one
heel
and
silver
trotted
forward
direction
was
a
thing
far
out
of
the
question
and
the
rider
made
no
effort
to
guide
his
horse
he
clung
to
the
saddle
fighting
every
moment
of
the
time
to
stay
alive
while
the
horse
carried
him
from
the
scene
of
sudden
death
where
buzzards
circled
lower
ever
lower
when
he
could
gather
the
strength
to
speak
he
whispered
in
a
husky
voice
close
to
the
ear
of
the
horse
away
silver
away
a
trail
of
red
that
continually
dripped
from
his
right
boot
warned
the
texas
ranger
that
he
must
stop
soon
and
try
to
make
some
sort
of
inventory
of
his
condition
but
he
could
inventory
nothing
he
could
remember
next
to
nothing
he
could
not
see
fifty
feet
ahead
or
behind
he
knew
however
that
the
wound
in
his
right
foot
was
the
one
most
in
need
of
attention
he
managed
to
examine
this
without
slackening
his
speed
the
sight
inside
his
boot
was
anything
but
reassuring
he
rode
on
sparing
neither
his
horse
nor
his
own
condition
spells
of
dizziness
recurring
with
increasing
frequency
made
him
realize
that
he
could
not
continue
much
further
without
stanching
the
flow
of
blood
from
the
boot
he
pulled
the
white
horse
to
a
halt
and
slid
to
the
ground
with
relief
he
found
that
his
vision
had
improved
and
he
could
scan
the
gap
behind
him
there
was
no
sign
of
pursuit
he
cut
open
the
boot
and
found
that
a
bullet
had
severed
a
small
artery
making
a
rude
tourniquet
he
succeeded
in
checking
to
some
extent
the
spurting
flow
that
was
sapping
his
strength
he
bandaged
the
wound
as
best
he
could
with
dressings
torn
from
his
shirt
he
tried
to
stand
and
found
that
the
loss
of
so
much
blood
had
sapped
his
strength
to
a
surprising
degree
he
could
however
support
his
weight
by
the
aid
of
his
horse
his
mind
was
clearer
he
found
himself
trying
to
analyze
the
events
that
had
led
up
to
the
massacre
while
his
eyes
studied
the
gap
why
had
the
texas
rangers
been
sent
for
if
they
were
not
wanted
in
bryant
basin
it
would
have
been
a
simple
matter
to
have
ignored
them
as
had
always
been
done
in
the
past
someone
had
sent
for
the
texas
rangers
someone
had
objected
with
bullets
to
their
coming
did
outlaws
actually
live
in
bryant
basin
if
so
why
were
they
there
why
had
the
rangers
been
sent
for
what
could
possibly
happen
in
the
cavendish
domain
that
the
stern
old
man
could
not
handle
himself
these
and
countless
other
questions
raced
through
the
ranger
brain
while
he
continued
to
observe
the
gap
he
noted
that
the
sun
was
gone
and
it
was
growing
dark
this
left
him
in
less
danger
of
capture
but
increased
the
difficulty
of
the
ride
the
rocky
footing
was
hazardous
under
the
best
of
conditions
in
the
dark
this
peril
was
increased
tenfold
he
remounted
after
a
struggle
with
weakness
at
first
he
tried
to
guide
the
horse
away
from
bryant
basin
but
this
seemed
only
to
confuse
the
beast
so
he
gave
up
the
attempt
and
let
silver
have
his
head
at
intervals
he
was
compelled
to
steady
himself
like
a
drunken
man
a
starless
night
fell
into
the
gap
and
with
its
coming
the
danger
of
pursuit
was
ended
a
chance
encounter
was
all
the
rider
had
to
fear
and
there
was
little
likelihood
of
this
for
a
while
his
mind
went
blank
he
was
roused
from
a
sort
of
stupor
by
the
sound
of
running
water
the
horse
had
halted
while
the
texas
ranger
dozed
and
was
drinking
from
a
creek
a
sudden
uncontrollable
thirst
assailed
the
man
once
more
he
climbed
painfully
from
the
saddle
slumping
to
the
ground
he
crawled
toward
a
stream
that
gurgled
over
stones
cold
water
had
never
tasted
sweeter
he
sipped
slowly
then
raised
his
head
to
let
the
cool
draft
quench
the
burning
in
his
throat
about
to
drink
again
he
paused
and
grew
tense
the
sound
he
heard
might
have
been
a
night
bird
but
the
trained
ear
of
the
ranger
detected
a
peculiar
quality
in
it
odd
he
thought
that
sounded
as
if
it
came
from
a
human
throat
he
waited
to
catch
the
next
call
if
it
were
repeated
he
did
see
that
silver
too
was
tense
the
birdlike
trill
sounded
again
nearer
this
time
the
horse
reacted
unexpectedly
to
the
call
silver
jerked
back
and
the
reins
slipped
from
the
wounded
man
hand
while
he
watched
in
consternation
the
white
horse
scampered
off
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
stunned
by
this
new
misfortune
the
wounded
man
listened
to
the
hoofbeats
until
they
were
swallowed
by
the
night
not
until
then
did
he
try
to
call
his
voice
was
barely
a
whisper
desertion
by
silver
was
the
worst
possible
thing
that
could
have
happened
pursuit
of
the
horse
was
out
of
the
question
the
wounded
man
could
even
stand
alone
with
such
philosophy
as
he
could
muster
he
turned
and
finished
the
drink
that
might
cost
him
his
life
then
he
dashed
water
over
his
face
which
had
become
caked
with
blood
sweat
and
alkali
dust
the
wound
on
his
forehead
was
a
minor
one
but
it
smarted
frightfully
as
the
water
touched
it
he
determined
to
make
himself
as
comfortable
as
possible
while
he
had
the
opportunity
and
plenty
of
water
he
turned
his
attention
to
his
other
wounds
removing
his
shirt
he
felt
gingerly
of
his
left
shoulder
his
left
arm
had
been
useless
to
him
now
he
knew
why
the
bullet
was
embedded
in
the
flesh
he
realized
that
this
might
cause
considerable
trouble
later
on
but
there
was
little
he
could
do
there
in
the
darkness
other
than
to
wash
the
wound
and
bandage
it
clumsily
the
bullet
was
sunk
deep
probably
to
the
bone
he
rightly
reasoned
that
some
of
the
force
had
been
lost
by
the
bullet
first
striking
a
rock
and
entering
his
arm
on
a
ricochet
otherwise
the
bone
would
have
been
broken
his
shoulder
fixed
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
looked
at
his
wounded
foot
again
it
was
difficult
to
determine
much
about
the
wound
in
the
darkness
but
the
bleeding
seemed
to
have
stopped
when
he
had
bathed
and
redressed
the
foot
he
found
that
he
could
stand
he
had
to
support
himself
by
clinging
to
a
rock
and
most
of
his
weight
was
taken
on
the
uninjured
leg
but
he
was
definitely
stronger
one
thought
remained
uppermost
in
the
texas
ranger
mind
must
live
he
breathed
must
fight
through
somehow
so
i
can
tell
what
happened
to
the
others
come
back
with
more
men
learn
what
going
on
at
the
cavendish
place
if
he
could
stay
in
the
stream
he
leave
no
trail
he
started
slowly
working
his
way
along
against
the
current
clinging
to
rocks
when
they
were
within
reach
crawling
on
his
stomach
when
his
wounded
leg
gave
out
frequently
he
paused
to
rest
still
remaining
in
the
stream
he
was
soaked
through
but
the
cold
water
was
pleasant
it
chilled
the
burning
of
his
wounds
and
made
the
pain
more
tolerable
the
stream
took
him
close
to
one
wall
of
the
canyon
the
wall
on
his
left
against
the
current
his
progress
was
painfully
slow
but
it
was
progress
somewhere
in
the
darkness
ahead
he
heard
the
sound
of
falling
water
this
animated
him
a
falls
might
mean
some
sort
of
gorge
a
tiny
cave
perhaps
in
which
a
man
might
hide
until
his
wounds
were
healed
by
resting
frequently
the
wounded
man
kept
going
longer
than
he
thought
possible
at
length
he
reached
the
falls
the
water
dropped
a
scant
four
feet
from
a
ledge
with
his
one
good
hand
the
wounded
ranger
pulled
himself
up
on
the
ledge
and
there
his
strength
abandoned
him
he
slumped
half
in
the
stream
half
out
of
it
and
sank
completely
spent
into
a
dense
void
of
unconsciousness
chapter
iii
the
cave
when
he
awakened
the
wounded
texas
ranger
realized
that
it
was
well
past
daybreak
the
sun
was
high
in
the
cloudless
sky
and
beating
down
on
the
ledge
it
must
have
been
the
sun
shining
directly
into
the
eyes
that
had
roused
him
when
he
moved
he
felt
a
new
torment
of
pain
in
every
fiber
of
his
being
his
wounds
had
stiffened
his
right
foot
and
leg
and
left
shoulder
and
arm
were
utterly
useless
movement
of
these
limbs
made
stabbing
pains
shoot
the
entire
length
of
his
body
he
lay
quietly
for
some
time
experimenting
with
the
slightest
movements
until
he
had
managed
to
turn
so
that
he
could
look
about
him
the
ledge
that
had
served
as
a
resting
place
at
night
was
a
dangerous
refuge
in
the
daytime
a
discovery
buoyed
his
hope
he
saw
that
the
water
came
from
an
opening
a
few
yards
back
on
the
ledge
the
opening
was
large
enough
for
a
man
to
enter
standing
up
with
room
to
spare
inside
he
would
be
sure
of
concealment
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
water
unless
someone
actually
entered
the
cave
he
would
be
comparatively
secure
his
only
considerations
would
be
hunger
weakness
and
complications
that
might
set
in
from
the
wounds
food
would
be
the
problem
even
with
a
good
horse
it
would
take
more
riding
than
he
could
do
in
his
present
state
to
reach
the
nearest
food
without
weapons
of
any
sort
he
could
scarcely
hunt
even
if
there
were
game
to
be
found
in
the
barren
gap
food
therefore
was
out
of
the
question
he
must
content
himself
with
water
until
he
was
strong
enough
to
travel
far
on
foot
he
crawled
painfully
toward
the
cave
and
stopped
just
beyond
the
entrance
inside
it
widened
out
surprisingly
torrents
of
water
in
some
ages
past
must
have
churned
furiously
seeking
exit
through
the
portal
to
carve
away
the
heavy
stone
in
such
a
manner
the
stream
came
from
somewhere
in
the
deep
dim
recesses
of
the
cave
gravel
and
shale
lined
the
water
edge
this
hard
ground
would
serve
the
texas
ranger
as
a
rough
couch
perhaps
for
many
days
to
come
the
outlook
was
desperate
yet
the
man
felt
that
there
must
be
some
reason
why
his
life
had
been
spared
thus
far
it
was
that
he
was
afraid
to
die
at
any
time
during
the
past
few
hours
death
would
have
been
a
welcome
relief
to
the
pain
of
living
some
voice
deep
within
him
kept
telling
him
that
he
must
live
must
fight
for
life
so
that
he
might
see
justice
done
and
so
he
fought
none
of
the
events
seemed
logical
to
him
yet
he
sensed
that
in
some
manner
everything
would
dovetail
into
a
finished
pattern
in
which
he
himself
would
play
a
prominent
part
every
element
of
his
life
during
the
past
day
and
night
had
been
a
new
experience
even
the
gap
and
the
cave
were
new
to
him
strange
random
thoughts
kept
intruding
on
his
efforts
to
make
plans
for
the
future
thoughts
of
his
life
in
the
past
the
silver
mine
inherited
from
his
father
but
never
worked
because
he
had
never
wanted
riches
he
was
tired
despite
the
recent
sleep
he
lay
back
right
hand
beneath
his
head
perhaps
he
dozed
he
could
tell
afterward
whether
he
had
slept
or
not
his
senses
played
such
pranks
that
his
thoughts
might
have
been
dreams
or
mere
hallucinations
at
any
rate
those
thoughts
were
vivid
and
oddly
assorted
against
the
roaring
background
of
the
water
in
the
cavern
he
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
first
it
was
the
voice
of
a
boy
an
indian
boy
whom
the
wounded
man
had
known
long
years
ago
he
too
had
been
a
boy
at
that
time
the
indian
was
alone
a
child
who
was
the
sole
survivor
of
a
furious
indian
war
the
son
of
a
chief
the
lad
had
remained
sorely
wounded
at
the
side
of
his
dead
parents
it
was
there
that
the
white
boy
found
him
and
took
him
as
a
friend
the
two
traveled
together
for
some
time
until
their
trails
separated
now
he
heard
the
voice
of
this
boy
again
against
the
blackness
of
the
cavern
depths
he
seemed
to
see
a
of
the
past
in
rapidly
changing
kaleidoscopic
scenes
he
saw
himself
as
a
hunter
riding
in
pursuit
of
bison
to
feed
starving
white
folks
in
a
village
and
indians
on
the
plains
he
saw
himself
riding
through
the
hills
in
preference
to
gathering
wealth
as
the
operator
of
a
silver
mine
and
then
a
reunion
with
the
indian
known
as
a
boy
together
the
two
rode
for
a
time
and
tonto
helped
the
ranger
capture
his
white
horse
the
day
he
joined
the
texas
rangers
was
a
vivid
recollection
his
pride
in
wearing
the
ranger
badge
was
tempered
by
the
loss
of
companionship
somewhere
in
the
background
of
his
visions
there
was
a
vague
memory
of
a
night
bird
call
he
wondered
at
the
scenes
in
a
detached
sort
of
way
was
this
what
dying
was
like
he
heard
that
one
past
went
by
in
review
as
a
man
soul
departed
he
no
longer
felt
the
wounds
the
rumbling
stream
became
a
distant
murmur
that
finally
resolved
itself
into
the
call
of
a
night
bird
odd
how
the
night
bird
call
continued
to
intrude
he
fumbled
with
his
right
hand
at
the
pocket
of
what
was
left
of
his
shirt
he
could
feel
the
small
square
object
there
and
wished
that
he
had
the
strength
to
take
it
out
he
would
have
liked
to
read
the
little
inscription
in
the
book
that
had
been
his
mother
gift
now
even
the
last
of
sounds
had
ceased
and
once
more
the
tall
man
slept
his
breathing
was
labored
and
his
hand
upon
his
breast
rose
and
fell
as
fingers
that
had
been
so
strong
and
capable
clutched
the
little
black
book
in
his
pocket
the
afternoon
was
well
advanced
the
sun
barely
peeped
over
the
rim
of
the
gap
but
the
last
rays
slanted
at
an
acute
angle
beyond
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
brushed
the
shoulder
of
the
sleeping
man
he
wakened
in
surprise
he
felt
himself
surrounded
by
almost
unbearable
heat
his
mouth
was
dry
his
throat
burning
with
thirst
again
he
was
barely
able
to
raise
one
arm
to
brush
a
hand
across
his
forehead
he
found
this
dry
and
hot
he
felt
giddy
his
mind
whirled
as
he
tried
to
comprehend
this
new
condition
he
must
have
tossed
restlessly
while
he
slept
his
shirt
was
more
ragged
than
ever
one
pocket
was
ripped
entirely
off
and
the
little
black
book
that
had
reposed
there
was
beside
him
where
it
must
have
fallen
from
his
hand
he
felt
his
shoulder
wondering
vaguely
at
the
neatness
of
the
bandage
he
knew
from
the
ugly
swelling
that
the
wound
had
become
infected
against
the
weakness
there
was
only
water
and
rest
and
he
already
found
that
rest
seemed
only
to
weaken
him
further
his
plight
was
critical
water
might
help
it
was
all
that
he
had
he
rolled
over
painfully
and
stretched
his
length
face
down
against
the
stream
it
was
then
that
he
saw
the
shadow
no
sound
had
reached
his
ears
above
the
water
clamor
but
someone
had
found
his
hideout
and
at
that
moment
stood
at
the
cavern
mouth
his
first
impulse
was
to
turn
quickly
he
started
to
reach
for
his
guns
forgetting
that
they
were
not
in
their
usual
places
then
he
remembered
that
he
was
unarmed
completely
at
the
mercy
of
whoever
stood
behind
him
for
a
brief
instant
he
felt
an
odd
prickling
sensation
move
along
his
spine
he
inwardly
shrank
from
the
impact
of
the
bullet
he
was
sure
would
come
at
any
instant
he
felt
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
turn
face
the
man
or
men
who
had
already
killed
his
five
companions
and
his
life
too
would
be
snuffed
out
but
did
it
matter
his
life
at
best
was
measured
in
hours
starvation
fever
and
infection
of
an
ugly
wound
were
all
potential
killers
it
was
simply
a
case
of
which
of
these
would
deliver
the
de
his
endurance
and
strength
had
carried
him
far
beyond
the
limits
of
most
men
but
his
own
far
limit
had
almost
been
reached
he
had
a
revulsion
to
a
bullet
in
the
back
but
after
all
it
did
matter
greatly
this
intruder
he
thought
is
a
friend
not
an
enemy
a
friend
perhaps
unwittingly
who
will
put
an
end
to
pain
the
man
at
the
entrance
watched
in
silence
and
as
the
dying
man
turned
saw
his
face
suffused
with
the
glow
of
fever
and
etched
with
pain
he
saw
the
glazed
eyes
that
had
once
been
so
steely
and
deep
saw
them
rise
slowly
to
meet
his
own
dark
eyes
the
wounded
man
looked
up
and
met
the
gaze
of
an
indian
his
lips
parted
slightly
his
first
attempt
at
speech
was
a
failure
then
he
breathed
the
name
of
the
friend
he
made
long
years
ago
tonto
the
indian
nodded
slowly
me
here
he
said
chapter
iv
gray
dawn
penelope
was
thundered
from
sleep
a
little
before
daybreak
she
stretched
lazily
yawned
deeply
then
blinked
her
eyes
wide
open
as
jagged
lightning
flooded
her
bedroom
with
white
light
she
leaped
from
bed
as
thunder
cracked
again
and
hurried
to
the
open
window
wind
whipped
her
brown
hair
and
dashed
cool
rain
against
her
tanned
face
her
nightgown
of
flimsy
stuff
was
blown
tightly
about
her
slender
form
penny
watched
the
storm
and
loved
it
she
hoped
it
would
continue
after
daybreak
when
she
planned
a
ride
her
first
since
returning
from
the
east
on
her
favorite
horse
she
was
radiant
vital
filled
with
a
zest
for
living
she
was
happiest
when
alone
in
the
saddle
wind
and
rain
in
her
face
and
hair
matching
her
endurance
against
the
fury
of
the
elements
she
had
often
mused
that
perhaps
her
reason
for
loving
the
thunder
was
that
it
was
the
one
thing
that
her
uncle
bryant
could
not
argue
with
or
dictate
to
thunder
mountain
she
had
ridden
there
for
years
if
she
could
slip
away
from
relatives
this
morning
she
was
going
to
seek
the
trail
known
so
long
ago
the
fact
that
this
was
forbidden
territory
merely
added
to
the
fun
of
riding
there
it
made
her
feel
quite
daring
to
defy
a
mandate
of
her
uncle
she
lighted
a
lamp
and
glanced
at
a
clock
on
the
dresser
it
was
far
too
early
for
anyone
to
be
stirring
in
the
house
but
at
least
she
could
dress
and
be
ready
for
a
quick
breakfast
she
looked
longingly
at
the
trim
riding
habit
she
had
brought
back
from
the
east
fancy
uncle
bryant
had
called
the
clothes
no
use
starting
the
day
with
a
row
she
mused
and
she
dressed
to
conform
with
her
stern
old
uncle
tastes
plain
clothes
made
for
good
hard
wear
her
hair
was
brushed
back
tight
and
would
remain
so
until
she
was
out
of
uncle
bryant
view
when
it
would
be
loosed
to
blow
and
breathe
cool
wet
air
it
was
still
dark
outside
when
she
finished
dressing
and
glanced
at
herself
in
the
mirror
she
was
amused
at
the
unattractive
outfit
it
would
have
been
quite
suitable
she
reflected
for
mort
wife
rebecca
to
wear
if
rebecca
ever
rode
a
horse
she
blew
out
the
lamp
and
sat
by
the
window
to
watch
the
storm
and
wait
for
the
sounds
of
people
moving
in
other
parts
of
the
house
the
rain
fell
steadily
with
a
promise
to
continue
for
quite
some
time
the
sound
of
water
on
the
roof
was
pleasant
to
penny
but
the
steady
rhythm
was
broken
by
a
man
voice
the
voice
was
a
blending
of
bass
and
discord
the
voice
of
her
cousin
vince
vince
cavendish
was
the
runt
of
the
family
about
one
hundred
pounds
of
concentrated
ill
will
a
small
package
of
frustrated
manhood
who
tried
to
make
himself
heard
and
observed
by
the
mere
power
of
his
bellow
his
wiry
hair
was
usually
cropped
short
so
it
bristled
on
his
small
head
like
stubble
in
a
hayfield
when
the
mowers
have
passed
his
face
when
shaved
was
blue
in
cast
but
it
was
more
often
unshaved
and
bristling
vince
was
puny
with
narrow
shoulders
and
a
narrower
mind
as
usual
he
was
arguing
penny
guessed
from
the
outline
of
the
men
that
it
was
mort
to
whom
vince
talked
lightning
a
moment
later
proved
her
guess
correct
the
two
were
right
beneath
her
window
sheltered
from
the
rain
by
overhanging
eaves
mort
was
the
sort
of
man
who
would
have
liked
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
world
on
shoulders
unsuited
to
support
the
burden
of
a
household
much
larger
than
vince
he
listened
to
his
brother
in
the
detached
sort
of
way
one
waits
for
a
kettle
to
boil
more
accurately
in
this
case
mort
was
waiting
for
vince
to
stop
boiling
penny
was
accustomed
to
arguments
between
the
brothers
her
cousins
i
give
my
favorite
eyetooth
she
thought
to
see
mort
knock
the
runt
down
but
that
too
much
to
hope
for
she
did
know
what
the
row
was
all
about
she
did
especially
care
vince
could
pick
a
fight
over
the
most
trivial
of
subjects
she
did
however
wonder
why
those
two
were
out
so
early
in
the
morning
yuh
got
ta
keep
her
in
hand
i
tell
yuh
bellowed
vince
might
be
a
mare
or
a
cow
he
talking
about
mused
penny
or
even
a
sow
they
ai
none
of
us
can
handle
her
if
you
ca
an
so
it
up
tuh
you
i
said
all
i
aim
tuh
say
on
the
subject
an
i
the
next
time
that
damn
wife
of
yores
breaks
bounds
mort
gosh
said
penny
to
herself
i
was
wrong
on
all
counts
it
wife
he
talking
about
i
wonder
why
mort
does
spank
the
little
weasel
penny
could
think
of
nothing
more
incongruous
than
poor
mouselike
negative
rebecca
breaking
bounds
especially
with
so
many
small
hands
on
her
apron
strings
equally
incongruous
was
the
idea
of
mort
being
unable
to
handle
becky
becky
was
a
living
example
of
a
woman
who
had
failed
miserably
to
live
up
to
the
heroic
name
given
her
by
romantic
parents
yet
vince
had
made
flat
statements
and
there
was
mort
agreeing
with
them
i
see
that
she
do
pull
no
more
stunts
like
that
last
he
promised
i
was
pretty
sore
about
that
an
i
let
her
know
it
i
reckon
after
what
i
said
an
done
she
think
a
good
many
times
before
she
tries
tuh
interfere
with
my
affairs
again
and
snarled
vince
if
it
was
only
yore
affairs
i
give
a
damn
but
when
she
starts
mixin
intuh
my
affairs
i
wo
stand
fer
it
she
wo
no
more
she
had
a
lesson
she
wo
fergit
penny
could
suppress
a
shudder
at
the
thought
of
the
punishment
probably
inflicted
upon
mort
wife
a
bully
who
dared
not
defy
another
man
mort
was
almost
sadistic
in
the
way
he
treated
rebecca
now
that
that
settled
said
mort
how
soon
is
rangoon
due
here
any
time
now
vince
replied
rangoon
was
one
of
several
cowhands
who
had
come
to
the
basin
during
penny
absence
to
replace
the
men
she
had
known
all
the
newcomers
seemed
to
have
a
common
surliness
of
manner
an
unwholesome
look
about
them
a
furtiveness
that
penny
did
like
she
could
think
of
no
reason
why
her
cousins
should
be
out
in
the
rain
before
daybreak
to
meet
one
of
the
hired
hands
she
drew
a
chair
to
the
window
and
sat
down
to
eavesdrop
without
the
slightest
feeling
of
compunction
she
rested
her
arms
on
the
windowsill
and
her
head
on
her
forearms
her
stockinged
feet
were
boyishly
wide
apart
mort
and
vince
grumbled
in
low
tones
about
the
weather
while
they
waited
for
rangoon
presently
the
cowhand
appeared
in
the
gathering
dawn
have
any
trouble
asked
mort
naw
replied
rangoon
we
did
have
no
trouble
but
it
took
time
tuh
git
back
here
in
the
dark
an
the
rain
you
might
come
back
last
night
said
vince
better
this
way
said
rangoon
everything
fixed
six
men
come
we
got
all
six
that
that
we
have
tuh
keep
a
close
check
an
see
that
there
ai
others
comin
tuh
learn
what
happened
when
them
six
do
return
if
any
others
come
mort
stated
softly
we
know
about
it
an
take
care
of
them
rangoon
gazed
steadily
at
mort
you
he
said
after
a
pause
better
give
that
wife
of
yores
a
lesson
he
goin
tuh
promised
vince
then
the
three
men
moved
away
and
penny
saw
them
disappear
beyond
the
corner
of
a
building
for
some
time
she
sat
at
the
window
with
her
thoughts
ever
since
her
return
she
had
been
bothered
by
an
unexplainable
apprehension
the
basin
which
had
been
her
home
for
many
years
had
always
been
a
happy
place
despite
her
surly
uncle
and
her
cousins
now
the
air
of
the
place
was
changed
bryant
surliness
had
trebled
on
several
occasions
he
had
spoken
sharply
even
to
penny
a
thing
he
never
done
before
at
times
the
girl
felt
quite
unwelcome
in
the
only
home
she
knew
she
pulled
on
her
boots
still
wondering
what
the
three
men
were
talking
about
her
thoughts
were
punctuated
by
a
period
in
the
form
of
a
soft
rap
on
her
bedroom
door
soft
as
it
was
the
rap
was
so
unexpected
that
it
startled
penny
whoever
had
rapped
had
tried
to
do
so
as
silently
as
secretly
perhaps
as
possible
and
penny
opened
the
door
in
the
same
cautious
manner
rebecca
cavendish
the
wife
of
mort
and
mother
of
too
many
children
made
her
appearance
stepping
into
the
room
nervously
quickly
with
birdlike
motions
and
closing
the
door
behind
her
penny
had
always
felt
sorry
for
rebecca
she
understood
the
woman
better
than
did
any
of
the
men
becky
always
reminded
penny
of
a
scarecrow
in
faded
calico
what
curves
and
grace
rebecca
might
have
had
were
mental
penny
felt
sure
that
her
mind
in
spite
of
years
of
hard
treatment
had
retained
a
womanly
softness
and
a
wistful
desire
for
gracious
living
she
was
a
woman
who
in
the
midst
of
plenty
lived
like
a
slave
a
woman
whose
mate
turned
to
her
only
in
passion
whose
children
looked
to
her
only
in
hunger
her
eyes
were
jet
but
dulled
they
reminded
penny
of
the
sharp
eyes
of
an
eagle
grown
discouraged
by
long
years
of
beating
strong
wings
against
the
stronger
bars
of
a
cage
rebecca
hair
was
black
without
a
trace
of
gray
to
complement
the
many
wrinkles
on
her
thin
face
rebecca
opened
the
door
again
glanced
quickly
into
the
hall
then
stepped
back
was
seen
i
guess
she
said
is
something
wrong
becky
asked
penny
it
was
the
first
time
becky
had
been
in
her
room
and
one
of
the
few
times
she
been
in
uncle
bryant
big
house
i
got
tuh
be
special
careful
whispered
the
woman
in
a
husky
voice
bryant
never
did
get
over
me
marryin
mort
an
mort
beat
me
tuh
within
a
inch
of
my
life
if
he
was
tuh
catch
me
here
at
a
loss
penny
said
sit
down
wo
you
becky
rebecca
shuffled
across
the
floor
sat
on
one
edge
of
the
bed
and
motioned
with
a
clawlike
hand
for
penny
to
sit
beside
her
what
i
got
tuh
tell
she
began
when
penny
was
seated
wo
take
me
long
you
must
seen
that
things
around
here
changed
aplenty
since
you
left
fer
school
things
have
changed
a
lot
said
penny
but
the
people
have
changed
a
lot
more
there
used
to
be
a
dandy
lot
of
cowhands
around
here
but
they
all
gone
i
do
like
the
looks
of
the
new
men
becky
nodded
quickly
just
so
she
said
that
why
i
here
come
to
tell
you
to
clear
out
clear
out
echoed
penny
you
mean
leave
the
basin
that
just
what
i
mean
it
do
matter
how
you
get
out
just
get
the
sooner
the
better
there
things
goin
on
around
here
that
healthy
things
you
be
happier
an
better
fer
not
knowin
about
now
do
ask
no
questions
just
penny
at
first
thought
that
torment
and
torture
had
addled
the
poor
brain
of
her
visitor
there
was
a
burning
sincerity
in
becky
eyes
now
take
it
easy
becky
she
said
softly
i
sure
things
are
that
bad
penny
felt
she
was
convincing
but
her
main
purpose
was
to
calm
and
reassure
the
nervous
woman
uncle
bryant
would
tolerate
anything
that
was
right
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
bryant
do
know
the
around
here
these
days
he
do
even
know
who
workin
here
no
more
penny
laughed
softly
despite
a
feeling
of
misgiving
that
silly
she
said
there
is
a
thing
that
goes
on
in
the
basin
that
uncle
bryant
does
know
about
she
recalled
the
talk
of
a
few
minutes
ago
when
the
men
were
beneath
her
window
and
wondered
if
her
statement
was
accurate
tell
me
some
more
becky
anger
rose
in
becky
eyes
do
believe
me
eh
she
rose
to
her
feet
yuh
do
believe
me
because
the
shack
where
i
live
is
away
side
of
the
corral
an
yuh
ca

the
sounds
when

me

fer
him
tuh

a
hand
tuh
me
he
done
it
till
it
commonplace
but
never
like
night
unexpectedly
rebecca
clawed
at
the
shoulder
of
her
flimsy
dress
and
ripped
it
away
from
her
bare
bony
arm
look
she
cried
livid
lines
glowed
angrily
across
the
arm
the
shoulder
and
as
much
of
the
woman
back
as
penny
could
see
the
skin
in
several
places
had
been
broken
and
was
beginning
to
heal
mort
the
damn
skunk
done
that
with
a
lash
rebecca
said
you
know
why
penny
speechless
at
the
exhibition
shook
her
head
rebecca
brushed
a
vagrant
lock
of
hair
off
her
damp
forehead
i
tell
yuh
why
she
went
on
it
because
i
did
stay
in
the
house
one
evenin
after
dark
the

stuffy

she
continued
i
i

she

conversation
and

said
penny
softly
what

and
mort
talking
about
the
other
night
in
the
cottonwoods
about
bryant
eyes
an
how
easy
it
was
tuh
becky
broke
off
sharply
she
gazed
at
penny
for
a
moment
her
voice
grew
harder
more
firm
i
did
hear
she
said
a
sudden
draft
blew
through
the
room
penny
saw
the
billowing
window
shades
then
saw
rebecca
with
mortal
terror
in
her
face
penny
followed
her
stare
mort
cavendish
stood
in
the
doorway
thunder
boomed
outside
the
window
mort
face
was
expressionless
for
fully
a
minute
no
one
spoke
to
break
the
tableau
becky
assumed
a
look
of
defiance
and
waited
for
mort
to
be
the
first
to
speak
when
he
did
so
his
voice
was
toneless
and
quite
soft
it
about
time
for
you
to
be
gettin
breakfast
for
the
kids
he
told
rebecca
to
penny
he
said
uncle
bryant
is
at
the
table
are
you
coming
penny
nodded
mort
stood
aside
so
his
wife
could
pass
she
moved
down
the
hall
without
a
backward
glance
mort
said
i
see
you
later
becky
and
penny
caught
the
threat
that
the
words
implied
chapter
v
tonto
the
men
were
at
the
breakfast
table
when
penny
entered
the
big
dining
room
she
returned
their
abbreviated
greetings
and
then
took
her
seat
to
surround
herself
with
the
same
wall
of
silence
that
seemed
to
confine
everyone
at
every
meal
the
cousins
her
uncle
and
penny
had
no
common
denominator
of
conversation
though
the
food
was
good
and
well
prepared
it
all
seemed
flat
and
tasteless
in
the
strained
atmosphere
of
the
cavendish
house
nothing
was
said
of
vince
absence
for
the
past
few
days
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
mort
would
eat
well
with
the
others
while
his
wife
ate
otherwise
with
her
brood
penny
was
relieved
when
the
meal
was
finished
and
she
could
leave
the
house
she
avoided
the
swelling
puddles
between
the
house
and
the
corral
it
was
easy
to
find
her
own
mustang
las
vegas
the
small
strong
beast
advanced
to
meet
her
a
man
came
from
the
saddle
shed
carrying
her
saddle
and
bridle
on
his
arm
sawtell
she
remembered
another
of
the
new
employees
sawtell
was
easier
to
look
at
than
rangoon
but
he
wore
an
expression
on
his
bland
face
that
made
one
feel
that
he
was
sneering
constantly
saw
yuh
in
the
ridin
outfit
he
said
so
i
brought
your
leather
thanks
said
penny
shortly
sawtell
seemed
inclined
to
talk
while
he
cinched
up
las
vegas
not
much
of
a
day
for
ridin
looks
like
it
clear
up
by
noon
though
might
be
better
for
you
to
wait
i
like
to
ride
in
the
rain
said
penny
her
face
lighted
as
a
thought
possessed
her
have
you
ever
ridden
up
the
side
of
thunder
mountain
she
asked
sawtell
looked
at
her
quickly
after
a
pause
he
said
why
when
i
was
younger
they
used
to
tell
me
that
no
one
could
ride
through
the
tangle
of
weeds
and
things
on
that
mountain
sawtell
nodded
with
a
trace
of
a
squint
in
his
eyes
but
continued
penny
i
went
there
anyway
and
i
found
a
trail
that
could
be
followed
right
up
to
the
peak
i
wonder
if
that
trail
is
still
there
sawtell
shook
his
head
slowly
i
know
about
that
trail
he
said
but
it
all
overgrown
now
and
you
break
the
leg
of
a
horse
you
tried
to
ride
up
there
penny
could
conceal
her
disappointment
she
mounted
gracefully
and
swung
las
vegas
away
from
the
group
of
buildings
most
of
penny
enthusiasm
for
her
ride
was
dissolved
by
the
statement
that
the
old
trail
up
thunder
mountain
was
gone
she
gazed
wistfully
at
the
huge
tangle
of
green
things
that
rose
to
such
majestic
heights
darn
it
las
vegas
she
complained
to
the
mustang
changed
here
she
looked
back
toward
the
house
and
noticed
that
in
riding
without
a
definite
direction
she
had
unconsciously
followed
the
route
of
her
explorations
of
another
day
she
had
placed
the
saddle
shed
between
her
and
the
house
so
that
uncle
bryant
if
watching
would
not
see
where
she
went
she
pulled
off
her
hat
and
drew
the
pins
from
her
hair
it
fell
in
soft
waves
which
were
rapidly
becoming
wet
to
her
shoulders
thunder
rumbled
somewhere
overhead
and
rain
beat
her
cheeks
she
seemed
to
feel
an
uplifting
as
the
wind
swept
her
hair
straight
out
she
thrilled
to
the
stinging
rain
like
an
old
salt
returning
to
the
spray
of
the
sea
she
slapped
las
vegas
on
the
rump
come
on
she
cried
las
vegas
dropped
his
ears
and
went
the
horse
stopped
at
the
foot
of
thunder
mountain
where
the
tall
brush
and
dense
trees
blocked
the
way
he
turned
his
head
as
if
to
question
penny
right
or
left
which
will
it
be
this
was
the
spot
where
the
old
trail
had
once
begun
penny
glanced
back
toward
the
distant
ranch
house
and
the
buildings
that
surrounded
it
sawtell
had
said
the
trail
was
now
impassable
penny
was
in
the
mood
that
uncle
bryant
had
once
termed
cussed
contrariness
well
what
we
waiting
for
she
called
to
las
vegas
are
you
scared
of
a
few
shrubs
she
heeled
the
mustang
at
the
same
time
whacking
her
hat
against
his
flank
the
mustang
lunged
into
the
tangle
thorns
tore
at
his
fetlocks
and
raked
his
sides
penny
was
nearly
swept
from
the
saddle
by
a
low
branch
brush
slapped
and
scratched
her
only
a
streak
of
cavendish
stubbornness
and
the
fact
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
turn
kept
her
going
las
vegas
seemed
determined
to
make
the
girl
regret
her
decision
as
he
plunged
ahead
then
surprisingly
the
trail
ahead
was
clear
without
warning
the
path
widened
where
the
brush
had
been
carefully
cut
back
the
route
went
around
treacherous
holes
and
rocks
that
were
too
large
to
move
branches
tossed
to
one
side
showed
that
the
trail
was
not
accidental
this
puzzled
her
sawtell
had
told
the
truth
about
the
first
hundred
yards
but
he
had
been
mistaken
about
the
part
of
the
path
the
girl
now
rode
interwoven
branches
of
trees
overhead
blocked
out
a
great
deal
of
the
rain
there
was
just
a
gentle
dripping
that
would
probably
continue
long
after
the
rain
had
actually
stopped
penny
took
her
watch
from
the
small
waterproof
envelope
that
was
pinned
to
her
shirt
she
thought
she
might
have
time
to
ride
all
the
way
to
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
if
the
path
remained
as
clean
as
it
was
at
present
now
that
she
no
longer
had
to
concentrate
on
staying
in
the
saddle
her
thoughts
went
back
to
the
scene
in
her
room
when
becky
had
called
if
it
had
been
for
the
peculiar
meeting
between
mort
vince
and
rangoon
she
might
have
thought
less
of
becky
warning
all
things
considered
however
she
felt
certain
that
there
was
something
definitely
wrong
in
bryant
basin
what
was
it
that
becky
had
started
to
say
about
her
uncle
eyes
what
had
she
overheard
in
the
clump
of
cottonwoods
penny
had
no
intention
of
following
rebecca
advice
she
was
quite
determined
to
stay
in
the
basin
and
see
what
happened
next
bryant
eyes
what
about
them
perhaps
she
could
persuade
rebecca
to
say
more
when
she
saw
her
later
in
the
day
she
call
on
her
in
the
humble
shack
and
have
a
talk
perhaps
if
she
were
there
when
mort
came
in
after
his
day
work
rebecca
would
be
spared
some
of
her
violence
penny
thoughts
were
broken
when
she
had
to
rein
up
suddenly
the
trail
ahead
was
blocked
by
the
most
magnificent
horse
that
the
girl
had
ever
seen
pure
white
with
muscles
that
rippled
in
a
way
that
made
his
coat
gleam
like
sparkling
silver
he
stood
there
and
looked
at
her
penny
dismounted
holding
the
reins
of
her
horse
while
she
advanced
toward
the
white
beast
gosh
she
breathed
in
admiration
what
a
horse
here
fellow
she
held
a
hand
before
her
but
the
white
horse
stood
motionless
the
girl
moved
one
step
nearer
and
the
white
horse
backed
slowly
do
be
afraid
of
me
the
girl
said
i
want
to
be
friends
silver
not
friends
penny
swung
startled
toward
the
thick
guttural
voice
then
she
saw
the
indian
he
was
tall
fully
six
feet
without
the
advantage
of
heels
he
was
clad
in
buckskin
and
moccasins
his
face
was
broad
and
characteristically
hair
was
drawn
straight
back
from
a
part
in
the
middle
and
done
in
a
war
knot
low
on
the
back
of
his
head
heavy
revolvers
of
the
most
modern
make
swung
from
his
waist
were
a
somewhat
incongruous
touch
a
bow
and
arrows
would
have
been
more
in
keeping
with
the
rest
of
the
indian
equipment
the
indian
was
a
man
his
face
showed
interest
in
the
girl
intellect
was
indicated
in
his
forehead
in
his
deep
dark
eyes
instead
of
hostility
there
was
a
warm
friendliness
i
i
was
admiring
your
horse
the
girl
stammered
that
not
my
horse
my
horse
yonder
penny
looked
beyond
the
white
horse
where
the
indian
pointed
and
for
the
first
time
noticed
that
the
trail
had
widened
to
a
clearing
fully
thirty
yards
across
the
open
space
was
bordered
by
huge
trees
and
just
beyond
one
of
the
largest
of
these
she
saw
a
paint
horse
my
horse
there
the
red
man
said
this
horse
not
mine
this
horse
name
silver
repeated
the
girl
it
certainly
suits
him
she
thought
her
uncle
would
delight
in
owning
such
a
beast
is
is
silver
for
sale
she
asked
the
indian
face
showed
a
faint
trace
of
a
smile
as
he
shook
his
head
slowly
there
was
a
somewhat
awkward
period
of
silence
the
indian
stood
as
if
waiting
for
penny
to
make
the
next
move
she
had
a
fleeting
thought
that
she
should
have
been
afraid
she
knew
that
she
was
far
from
anyone
who
might
help
her
yet
she
felt
quite
at
ease
the
indian
had
been
friendly
so
far
respectful
too
and
there
was
something
magnetic
about
his
personality
me
tonto
the
indian
finally
said
tonto
is
that
your
name
the
man
nodded
do
you
live
here
no
replied
tonto
me
here
short
time
maybe
leave
soon
then
penny
saw
the
crude
fashioned
from
spreading
branches
of
pine
inside
there
was
considerable
duffle
packed
for
quick
loading
on
a
horse
do
you
mind
said
penny
with
an
impulsiveness
that
later
surprised
her
when
she
thought
of
it
if
i
sit
in
your
and
get
out
of
the
rain
for
a
few
minutes
tonto
looked
a
bit
surprised
then
glad
that
he
was
so
trusted
by
the
girl
he
seemed
to
be
bending
every
effort
to
put
her
at
ease
when
she
stepped
on
the
soft
boughs
of
evergreen
that
carpeted
the
the
indian
removed
his
belt
and
the
heavy
revolvers
and
tossed
them
on
the
floor
close
to
her
me
not
need
guns
now
he
muttered
penny
understood
and
appreciated
the
red
man
gesture
he
was
putting
his
only
weapons
where
she
could
reach
them
if
she
cared
to
he
remained
just
outside
the
roof
of
the
small
shelter
ignoring
the
drizzle
as
he
sat
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
i
from
the
basin
the
girl
explained
i
used
to
come
up
this
trail
a
lot
but
it
was
always
pretty
hard
riding
it
been
cleared
since
the
last
time
i
used
it
the
indian
nodded
that
plenty
strange
he
muttered
penny
looked
at
him
sharply
strange
why
tonto
did
reply
he
seemed
deeply
preoccupied
do
any
of
the
men
from
the
basin
ride
this
way
asked
penny
after
a
pause
tonto
did
reply
who
owns
the
white
horse
there
was
another
pause
then
tonto
said
my
friend
the
way
he
said
it
was
peculiarly
impressive
penny
wondered
if
the
friend
were
another
indian
or
a
white
man
she
said
does
your
friend
live
in
the
basin
once
more
the
indian
gave
a
negative
shake
of
his
head
where
is
he
now
him
plenty
sick
tonto
come
here
look
for
feller
to
ride
by
get
food
for
friend
penny
could
be
very
adroit
at
questioning
when
she
chose
she
talked
with
the
big
indian
at
length
and
learned
that
his
friend
was
close
to
death
she
further
learned
that
men
from
bryant
basin
had
been
known
to
travel
on
the
thunder
mountain
trail
this
surprised
her
tonto
needed
certain
kinds
of
food
for
his
friend
food
which
could
be
shot
or
caught
with
hook
and
line
and
he
was
waiting
to
take
what
he
needed
from
the
first
men
who
rode
through
the
clearing
as
penny
listened
to
what
tonto
said
she
felt
herself
becoming
keenly
interested
in
his
needs
she
tried
to
determine
which
of
the
basin
men
had
used
the
thunder
mountain
trail
but
tonto
could
describe
them
he
knew
only
what
he
read
in
the
hoofmarks
on
the
ground
it
was
a
day
of
surprises
and
most
of
all
penny
was
surprised
at
herself
before
she
realized
what
she
had
done
she
had
promised
to
ride
back
to
the
basin
and
secure
the
things
that
tonto
needed
the
look
of
gratitude
that
showed
in
the
indian
face
was
a
thing
to
behold
it
was
radiant
and
said
thanks
more
effectively
than
any
spoken
words
then
penny
mounted
las
vegas
and
started
her
return
i
must
be
a
darn
fool
she
told
las
vegas
i
do
know
what
possessed
me
to
make
me
promise
to
take
food
to
that
indian
if
uncle
bryant
knew
about
it
he
be
frantic
he
must
know
she
rode
in
silence
for
a
time
she
tried
to
tell
herself
that
she
was
working
in
the
interests
of
her
uncle
in
taking
food
back
to
the
clearing
further
talk
with
tonto
might
bring
out
more
facts
concerning
men
from
the
basin
who
rode
on
thunder
mountain
secretly
yet
in
her
heart
the
girl
knew
this
was
the
real
reason
for
helping
the
indian
named
tonto
it
was
something
far
more
subtle
something
she
name
something
that
moved
her
when
she
heard
tonto
say
my
friend
chapter
vi
silver
after
penny
left
the
clearing
tonto
stepped
to
the
side
of
the
big
white
horse
he
stroked
the
silken
sheen
of
the
stallion
nose
and
said
soon
girl
come
back
with
plenty
food
then
we
go
to
white
friend
a
rare
bond
of
friendship
existed
between
the
wounded
texas
ranger
in
the
cave
the
indian
named
tonto
and
the
mighty
stallion
silver
tonto
and
silver
were
of
royal
blood
tonto
was
the
son
of
a
chief
silver
a
former
ruler
but
these
were
honors
of
the
past
destiny
had
even
greater
things
ahead
for
the
white
man
tonto
lost
his
chance
to
reign
when
his
tribe
was
wiped
out
in
his
boyhood
silver
had
abdicated
the
stallion
background
is
a
story
in
itself
wild
horse
valley
nestled
in
the
heart
of
green
hills
was
a
sanctuary
where
men
had
never
been
the
grass
was
green
and
lush
great
trees
spread
leafy
boughs
to
cast
soft
shade
here
from
the
living
rock
came
waterfalls
that
were
sweet
and
pure
king
sylvan
and
his
gentle
mate
moussa
ruled
this
land
their
court
was
made
up
of
untamed
horses
horses
that
had
never
known
restraining
bit
or
binding
saddlestrap
happy
carefree
horses
they
were
that
had
never
seen
men
nor
known
men
inventions
sylvan
had
won
the
right
to
rule
his
followers
by
might
and
courage
he
was
the
fleetest
of
foot
the
quickest
of
eye
the
greatest
of
strength
sylvan
the
king
then
moussa
bore
the
king
a
son
a
prince
and
sylvan
happiness
was
complete
his
fleet
hoofs
pounded
the
turf
racing
turning
flashing
a
white
coat
in
the
bright
sun
he
hoped
his
little
son
would
see
his
strength
his
speed
and
emulate
them
less
than
two
hours
after
his
birth
the
prince
was
trying
his
slim
straight
legs
in
the
months
that
followed
the
white
colt
developed
the
strength
and
fearlessness
of
sylvan
added
to
these
were
the
gentleness
grace
and
beauty
of
moussa
for
many
weeks
the
prince
of
wild
horse
valley
stayed
close
to
his
mother
side
and
his
little
shadow
merged
with
hers
as
the
two
moved
through
the
valley
guided
by
sylvan
who
knew
where
water
was
sweetest
and
grass
most
tender
then
came
the
days
when
colthood
was
left
behind
and
the
son
could
outrun
moussa
and
keep
pace
with
mighty
sylvan
like
the
wind
the
white
one
and
sylvan
raced
side
by
side
how
the
sun
flashed
from
their
sleek
bodies
as
they
raced
cut
back
reared
and
whirled
in
sheer
joy
life
was
good
life
was
sweet
and
moussa
watched
with
pride
tragedy
came
into
the
prince
life
when
moussa
went
to
the
everlasting
happiness
of
other
green
pastures
by
this
time
the
prince
was
fully
grown
and
the
equal
in
strength
of
his
father
day
after
day
the
prince
met
and
defeated
new
challengers
in
the
field
of
combat
while
sylvan
remained
king
the
prince
fought
to
hold
his
own
exalted
position
the
battles
were
furious
no
quarter
was
asked
none
given
the
white
prince
never
paused
in
the
fray
until
his
opponent
lay
conquered
at
his
feet
finally
when
the
last
challenger
was
beaten
the
prince
called
out
in
his
victory
sylvan
responded
with
mighty
pride
a
king
and
his
son
both
conquerors
and
champions
stronger
greater
than
any
other
in
their
herd
acknowledged
by
all
as
the
ones
who
should
lead
while
others
followed
then
one
day
at
the
narrow
entrance
to
the
valley
strange
creatures
waited
with
cruel
weapons
creatures
new
to
the
horses
men
who
came
with
tragedy
and
pain
these
were
intruders
who
were
looked
upon
as
enemies
to
be
driven
away
the
king
sounded
the
attack
and
led
the
charge
fire
like
lightning
flashed
before
the
horses
thunder
roared
deafeningly
close
at
hand
the
fury
of
those
hammering
hoofs
could
not
long
be
withstood
and
the
men
retreated
then
rode
away
to
save
their
lives
the
prince
raised
his
strong
voice
in
shrill
exultation
but
his
cry
was
short
the
king
was
on
the
ground
beside
him
mighty
sylvan
was
dead
burning
hatred
for
men
grew
in
silver
heart
while
he
gently
nuzzled
his
father
prostrate
form
there
was
little
left
for
the
prince
in
that
valley
nothing
to
conquer
or
to
love
for
some
time
he
stood
motionless
looking
at
the
soft
grass
the
trees
the
valley
that
had
been
his
home
then
he
turned
to
leave
the
valley
alone
the
white
horse
made
his
way
through
the
mountains
hour
after
hour
he
held
a
steady
lope
that
carried
him
ever
further
from
the
place
where
he
had
known
happiness
and
joy
then
tragedy
and
sudden
death
the
white
stallion
wanted
to
travel
far
far
from
the
place
where
he
had
seen
those
hated
men
who
had
killed
his
father
the
mountains
gave
way
to
level
plains
here
was
a
new
world
level
land
as
far
as
he
could
see
he
raced
across
it
ignoring
the
danger
of
gopher
holes
and
rocks
then
suddenly
quite
out
of
wind
he
stopped
ahead
of
the
prince
there
was
a
challenger
not
another
horse
and
not
a
man
a
dirty
beast
of
muddy
color
with
a
tangled
mane
and
a
huge
hump
on
its
back
a
buffalo
the
prince
saw
tiny
eyes
that
seemed
filled
with
evil
and
hatred
as
if
in
anger
at
intrusion
of
its
domain
the
huge
beast
stamped
and
pawed
the
ground
from
the
monster
there
came
a
horrible
bellow
and
then
the
muddy
fury
charged
with
all
the
agility
the
white
one
could
command
in
his
exhaustion
he
stepped
aside
to
dodge
the
charge
here
was
a
new
kind
of
battle
as
the
buffalo
raced
past
him
the
prince
felt
the
rough
fur
brush
his
body
and
a
foul
odor
assailed
his
nostrils
mad
with
fury
screaming
with
rage
the
buffalo
turned
and
charged
again
again
the
white
horse
sidestepped
time
after
time
the
game
was
played
but
it
could
not
last
forever
soon
the
two
must
come
to
grips
and
this
would
be
a
battle
to
the
death
great
bellows
filled
the
air
mountains
of
dust
rose
from
beneath
the
churning
hoofs
as
the
battle
began
in
earnest
the
buffalo
drew
blood
from
the
horse
side
the
prince
reared
high
and
struck
down
with
all
his
strength
the
power
of
the
huge
horse
hoofs
seemed
ineffectual
against
the
hairy
beast
the
massive
head
was
a
battering
ram
driving
relentlessly
into
the
white
body
of
the
prince
trembling
and
weak
the
white
one
grew
unsteady
but
his
gallant
heart
knew
no
defeat
he
fought
on
desperately
and
hopelessly
against
the
greater
strength
of
his
opponent
utter
exhaustion
robbed
the
brave
horse
of
the
power
to
stand
he
slumped
to
the
ground
legs
useless
the
king
of
horses
raised
his
head
to
meet
the
death
that
was
at
hand
evil
eyes
glowed
redder
than
before
as
the
buffalo
drew
back
head
lowered
for
the
final
rush
the
buffalo
charged
then
seemed
to
halt
in
and
crumpled
to
the
ground
the
white
one
did
understand
at
first
and
then
the
echo
of
a
gun
the
same
sort
of
sound
he
heard
when
sylvan
had
been
struck
down
it
was
later
that
the
white
horse
opened
his
eyes
which
were
bright
with
pain
he
knew
then
that
man
was
not
always
an
enemy
gentle
hands
caressed
him
and
he
felt
cool
water
on
his
wounds
his
strength
some
of
it
was
returning
and
the
proud
head
came
up
once
more
he
remembered
sylvan
here
were
hated
men
again
two
of
them
the
tired
body
rose
from
the
ground
on
trembling
weakened
legs
for
a
moment
silver
stood
there
then
he
turned
and
fled
he
ran
for
a
time
but
slower
with
each
passing
moment
for
some
reason
the
prince
felt
that
he
had
left
a
friend
behind
him
he
had
learned
a
grim
lesson
in
the
wilderness
outside
of
wild
horse
valley
there
were
creatures
there
far
stronger
than
any
horse
had
been
huge
shaggy
ugly
brutes
who
could
kill
him
beasts
that
fell
only
before
the
weapons
of
man
the
horse
slowed
then
stopped
and
looked
back
he
seemed
to
know
that
in
this
new
world
outside
the
valley
he
needed
friends
with
another
strength
than
his
he
recalled
the
gentle
touch
and
the
deep
kindly
voice
of
the
man
who
had
bathed
his
wounds
he
took
a
few
steps
toward
the
recent
scene
of
battle
where
the
two
men
stood
still
watching
him
the
terrible
weapon
that
had
killed
the
buffalo
was
quiet
now
some
strong
force
drew
silver
nearer
he
was
tense
ready
to
turn
and
flee
forever
from
creatures
in
the
form
of
men
if
the
thundering
machine
of
death
was
fired
again
but
there
was
only
silence
the
touch
of
the
man
hand
was
so
like
the
soft
caress
of
moussa
silver
wanted
more
of
it
the
voice
of
the
man
was
good
to
hear
it
was
rich
friendly
silver
went
still
closer
still
tense
ready
to
bolt
and
then
he
was
at
the
side
of
the
tall
man
who
had
saved
his
life
he
touched
his
sensitive
nostrils
to
the
brown
hand
and
a
new
emotion
was
born
in
the
heart
of
the
horse
a
love
of
beast
for
man
the
texan
found
it
hard
to
restrain
his
excitement
the
finest
horse
i
ever
seen
he
told
the
indian
beside
him
look
at
him
tonto
these
muscles
and
the
eyes
the
tail
and
mane
are
like
silk
look
at
his
coat
how
it
glistens
in
the
sun
i
going
to
ride
this
horse
he
came
back
after
he
left
us
i
going
to
ride
him
and
his
name
shall
be
silver
the
horse
stood
quietly
while
the
tall
man
with
the
deep
voice
and
gentle
touch
mounted
his
bare
back
you
silver
the
man
said
we
going
to
be
friends
are
we
old
boy
a
gentle
caress
on
the
white
neck
to
show
his
happiness
and
demonstrate
the
fact
that
he
was
strong
again
the
white
horse
rose
high
on
his
hind
legs
then
came
down
without
a
jar
he
would
prove
to
this
white
man
who
had
defended
him
that
he
was
glad
to
have
a
friend
silver
the
man
cried
out
again
trying
to
understand
what
the
man
on
his
back
wanted
silver
repeated
his
rearing
action
he
heard
the
happy
laugh
of
his
rider
now
big
fellow
the
man
called
out
let
travel
there
silver
for
a
moment
the
white
horse
could
comprehend
then
he
felt
a
nudge
from
the
heels
of
the
man
on
his
back
hi
there
you
silver
horse
silver
moved
ahead
carrying
his
master
he
was
desperately
anxious
to
do
what
this
man
wanted
eager
to
show
his
happiness
at
the
finding
of
a
friend
as
he
moved
he
heard
shouts
of
encouragement
that
it
silver
hi
you
silver
away
the
horse
moved
faster
another
shout
this
time
contracted
silver
away
silver
broke
into
a
run
now
he
knew
what
the
master
wanted
at
the
next
shout
the
big
stallion
gave
all
his
strength
in
a
burst
of
speed
that
made
his
snowy
figure
like
a
flash
of
light
across
the
open
plains
the
shout
was
one
that
later
rang
throughout
the
west
the
clarion
call
the
tocsin
of
a
mystery
rider
who
wore
a
mask
silver
chapter
vii
yuma
it
was
midafternoon
before
penelope
returned
to
the
clearing
in
the
woods
she
had
found
some
difficulty
in
slipping
unobserved
into
the
storeroom
on
the
ranch
to
secure
the
things
that
now
reposed
in
saddlebags
while
in
the
basin
the
girl
had
made
sure
that
mort
cavendish
would
be
occupied
with
the
supervision
of
branding
a
lot
of
new
cattle
he
could
hardly
get
back
home
before
dark
this
would
give
penny
ample
time
to
make
her
call
on
becky
and
be
with
her
when
mort
came
in
when
penny
turned
the
supplies
over
to
tonto
she
saw
the
gratitude
in
the
indian
eyes
it
was
almost
as
if
the
food
were
going
to
save
his
life
she
later
thought
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
the
food
was
to
save
a
life
that
was
more
important
to
the
indian
than
his
own
could
possibly
be
while
in
the
clearing
penny
tried
to
learn
more
about
the
trail
but
tonto
either
would
not
or
could
not
inform
her
regarding
its
origin
she
tried
again
to
make
friends
with
the
horse
called
silver
but
her
overtures
were
rejected
silver
remained
aloof
las
vegas
stood
by
and
penny
had
the
impression
that
he
was
laughing
at
her
rebuff
by
silver
in
whatever
way
a
mustang
had
of
laughing
it
irked
her
i
come
back
she
said
to
silver
and
bring
some
sugar
and
oats
that
make
you
beg
to
be
friends
she
mounted
las
vegas
and
rode
away
little
realizing
the
grim
sequence
of
events
that
was
to
be
started
simply
because
she
decided
to
take
sugar
to
a
stallion
or
the
appalling
episode
that
portended
in
the
basin
penny
reached
the
basin
and
rode
directly
to
the
ranch
house
as
she
rounded
the
corner
and
came
into
view
of
the
porch
she
saw
first
of
all
big
stockinged
feet
resting
on
the
railing
then
long
legs
and
then
the
face
of
cousin
jeb
jeb
was
looked
upon
by
everyone
as
worthless
details
of
work
about
the
ranch
were
mysteries
he
never
tried
to
fathom
and
he
helped
best
by
keeping
out
of
people
way
while
penny
had
no
respect
for
jeb
she
disliked
him
far
less
than
she
did
her
other
cousins
jeb
three
brothers
she
had
thought
several
times
that
jeb
was
not
nearly
so
simple
as
he
was
thought
to
be
he
had
a
lot
of
idle
time
and
he
spent
it
all
in
thinking
sometimes
the
results
of
his
periods
of
concentration
were
surprisingly
astute
the
girl
dismounted
near
the
steps
and
slapped
las
vegas
in
the
proper
place
get
going
she
said
her
respect
for
the
mustang
lessened
after
seeing
the
silver
stallion
las
vegas
scampered
toward
the
corral
while
penny
mounted
the
porch
and
perched
on
the
railing
what
new
jeb
she
greeted
her
cousin
jeb
looked
at
the
girl
with
eyes
that
were
watery
and
weak
much
i
guess
he
replied
without
breaking
the
rhythm
of
his
chewing
of
a
match
he
stared
off
at
the
distant
gap
got
some
more
thinkin
tuh
do
before
i
come
tuh
any
conclusions
so
far
i
say
they
hai
nothin
much
that
new
he
let
his
chair
drop
to
its
normal
position
he
slipped
his
feet
into
heavy
shoes
that
had
no
laces
and
pushed
himself
by
the
arms
of
the
chair
to
his
feet
standing
erect
jeb
cavendish
would
have
been
uncommonly
tall
even
in
his
slouching
posture
he
was
well
over
six
feet
two
inches
his
growin
all
went
one
way
he
explained
from
time
to
time
and
it
was
true
the
same
poundage
would
have
made
a
normal
man
of
five
feet
eight
jeb
was
that
lean
lot
o
thinkin
tuh
git
done
he
repeated
musingly
as
he
pushed
his
tapering
hands
deep
into
the
pockets
of
faded
dungarees
that
ended
halfway
between
his
knees
and
penny
waited
knowing
that
jeb
would
have
more
to
say
if
given
sufficient
time
jeb
spat
through
teeth
that
were
large
and
horsy
then
he
took
off
a
battered
hat
that
was
ventilated
with
several
holes
and
scratched
the
naked
part
of
his
head
that
was
constantly
widening
with
the
ebbing
of
his
thin
hair
yuh
know
penelope
he
said
at
length
it
writ
in
scripture
that
the
lord
tempers
the
wind
tuh
the
shorn
lamb
so
jeb
was
in
one
of
the
moods
what
about
it
asked
penny
i
heard
of
that
and
i
always
thought
that
if
the
lamb
had
been
shorn
the
wind
would
have
had
to
be
tempered
jeb
looked
at
the
girl
reprovingly
and
went
on
mebbe
reasonin
along
them
same
lines
it
the
lord
will
tuh
blind
uncle
bryant
so
he
ca
see
what
goes
on
around
here
meaning
what
asked
penny
quickly
meanin
it
save
bryant
a
powerful
lot
of
mental
sufferin
an
bloody
sweat
if
he
did
see
too
much
penny
rose
and
faced
her
cousin
directly
jeb
she
said
is
it
true
that
uncle
bryant
eyes
are
going
back
on
him
dunno
but
you
think
they
are
bryant
never
complained
about
his

answered
with
another
question
have
yuh
seen
him

of

she
said
so
but
he
never
did
spend
much
time
reading

that

having
delivered
himself
of
this
jeb
resumed
his
chair
and
slipped
his
feet
out
of
the
shoes
again
more
thinkin
he
finished
letting
his
eyes
return
to
places
penny
gripped
her
cousin
arm
look
here
jeb
she
said
i
want
to
know
more
about
things
in
the
basin
everyone
has
been
so
darned
quiet
and
so
that
it
almost
seems
as
if
the
place
is
filled
with
with
ghosts
or
something
what
it
all
about
jeb
fixed
his
pale
eyes
on
the
girl
they
seemed
to
cover
themselves
with
a
veil
he
leaned
forward
and
spoke
in
a
soft
confidential
voice
cousin
around
here

i
tetched
in
the
head
none
of

jeb
voice
took
on
a
quality
that
chilled
penelope
more
than
the
rain
that
had
but
recently
stopped
falling
there
was
something
almost
sepulchral
about
the
way
he
spoke
he
seemed
to
be
foretelling
events
with
an
authority
that
could
not
be
doubted
things
ca
boil
underneath
without
breakin
out
soon
murder

comin
an
that
wo
be
all
and
i

some
more
his
voice
fell
to
a
hoarse
whisper
uncle

but
that
jeb
stopped
the
girl
it
true
do
ask

no
more
bryant
is
makin

i
know
it
he
makin
ready
tuh
die
penny
knew
that
she
gain
nothing
by
pressing
jeb
for
further
information
at
that
time
she
also
knew
that
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
to
rebecca
she
crossed
the
porch
and
entered
the
house
to
find
another
cousin
sprawling
in
the
living
room
the
mere
fact
that
wallie
was
there
in
his
overdressed
glory
was
substantial
evidence
that
bryant
was
not
around
bryant
hated
wallie
chiefly
for
his
clothes
secondarily
for
his
indolent
love
of
social
life
and
the
girls
in
the
nearest
town
wallie
was
experimenting
with
a
guitar
doubtless
practicing
some
new
tune
to
play
in
his
part
of
don
juan
his
shirt
and
the
tightly
wound
neckerchief
on
his
fat
neck
were
of
the
finest
silk
and
of
brilliant
hue
his
trousers
were
of
fawnskin
and
his
boots
as
usual
gleamed
like
mirrors
he
had
practiced
long
to
strum
the
strings
of
his
guitar
in
the
manner
that
would
best
bring
out
the
sparkle
of
the
imitation
diamond
on
one
of
ten
fat
fingers
he
wore
two
guns
but
would
have
had
the
nerve
to
use
them
the
guns
were
hypocrisy
the
ring
an
imitation
the
two
were
symbolic
of
the
man
who
wore
them
an
imitation
and
a
hypocrite
penny
walked
past
without
speaking
and
entered
the
kitchen
where
old
gimlet
was
cooking
supper
his
one
good
eye
set
in
a
round
and
wrinkled
face
was
like
the
currant
in
a
hot
cross
bun
the
one
eye
that
gave
the
man
his
nickname
was
sharp
and
penetrating
but
now
it
lighted
with
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
the
girl
exclaimed
gimlet
i
glad
tuh
see
yuh
back
miss
penny
i
shore
as
hell
pardon
the
cussin
i
shore
worry
when
yuh
around
penny
smiled
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
wo
be
here
for
supper
i
going
over
to
becky
place
gimlet
frowned
if
i
o
knowed
that
i
o
taken
a
lot
less
trouble
in
fixin
good
eatin
steaks
the
girl
exchanged
a
few
more
words
with
the
cook
then
left
by
the
rear
door
at
the
corral
which
lay
between
her
home
and
rebecca
she
saw
yuma
working
on
las
vegas
yuma
was
the
only
new
employee
in
the
basin
that
penny
could
look
at
without
an
instinctive
feeling
of
revulsion
yuma
was
working
a
brush
vigorously
over
the
hide
of
the
mustang
when
penny
approached
she
had
heard
a
few
rumors
about
the
big
cowpuncher
with
shoulders
so
big
and
broad
that
they
seemed
to
droop
of
their
own
weight
it
had
been
said
by
expert
judges
of
good
fighters
that
a
blow
from
yuma
fist
would
drop
a
bull
he
had
once
been
locked
in
the
back
room
of
a
saloon
with

men
in
what
was
to
be
a
fight
to
the
finish
yuma
finish
supposedly
a
short
time
later
his
fists
crashed
through
the
panels
of
a
locked
door
and
a
mighty
demon
of
a
man
walked
out
his
clothing
was
in
shreds
inside
the
room
debris
and
wreckage
were
everywhere
and
four
men
were
prostrate
on
the
floor
you
need
rub
the
hide
off
him
said
penny
as
she
came
near
yuma

up
and
grew
red
in
the
face
before
the
pretty
girl
the
giant
was
flushed
and
bashful
shore

teasing
voice

yuma
stared
mouth
open
miss
penelope
i
er
uh
he
paused
completely
at
a
loss
penny
really
enjoyed
watching
the
young
giant
squirm
in
his
embarrassment
she
rested
her
elbows
on
a
rail
of
the
corral
and
hooked
the
heel
of
one
boot
on
a
lower
rail
leaning
back
she
watched
him
for
a
moment
then
said
what
your
name
folks
jest
sort
o
call
me
that
where
i
come
from

but
everyone

to

so
yuma
straightened
and
looked
directly
at
the
girl
with
his
clear
blue
eyes
that
remark
she
said
calls
for
a
little
expanding
what
do
you

at
the
blond

slowly
a

of
anger

o
dangerous
by

yuma
took
a
step
closer
to
the
girl
his
thumb
jerked
over
his
shoulder
in
the
general
direction
of
the
open
grazing
land
out

penny
knew
from
his
manner
that
yuma
told
the
truth
but
she
nevertheless
found
it
hard
to
believe
him
what

names
she
asked

yuma

dropped
penny
could
have
bitten
her
tongue
she
had
turned
the
sincerity
of
the
man
from
arizona
aside
with
banter
she
realized
instantly
that
yuma
sensed
the
danger
others

mentioned
and
wanted

hand
on

yuma
hurriedly
wiped
his
right
hand
on
his
shirt
he
clasped

a
delicate
thing
that

break
at
a
calloused
touch
he
said
penny

and
ran
toward

the
girl
who
ran
as
gracefully
as
a
fawn
he
looked
in
awe
at
his
hand
the

touched
the

opened
the
door
of

home
the
place

of
one
room
with
a
cloth
partition
at
the
far
end
shutting
off
the
beds
from

some
of
the
children

have
been
in

for
there
were
only
two
in

both
whimpering
and
sweaty
the
room
was
like
an
oven
with
heat
from
the
stove
and
humidity
from
the
recent
rain

scolding
the
uncomprehending
baby
in
the
crib
and
the
sobbing
child
who
sat
on
the
floor

a
surprise
it
must
have
been
later

demanded

my
but
ai

a
surprise
that

penny
the
tired
drudge
returned
his
stare
i
mean
it
she
said
the
whimpering
of
the
young
ones

as
they
became
absorbed
in
the
adult
conversation

advancing
on
his

penny
darted
a
quick
look
at
the
children
they
seemed
fascinated
by
the
argument
between
their
parents
she
felt
the
embarrassment
the
others
lacked
the
grace
to
feel
she
was
frightened
for
rebecca
but
rebecca
was
a
changed
personality
who
now
seemed
formidable
i
thought
the
hull

on
rebecca

glowing
with
hatred
and
defiance

from

of

becky

becky
with
a
fire
she

continued
the
girl
ignoring
the
interruption

at

any
time

want
glass
from
the
window
crashed
in
before
the
sound
of
the
shot
reached
penny
ears
she
instinctively
knew
it
was
a
slug
that
tore
through
the
window
her
startled
half
cry
of
alarm
and
surprise
choked
in
her
throat
as
she
saw
rebecca
spin
halfway
around
from
the
impact
of
the
lead
and
stagger
giddily
for
several
seconds
then
penny
clutched
her
about
the
waist
and
tried
to
guide
her
to
a
chair
becky
mouth
dropped
open
her
hand
clutched
her
breast
and
she
stared
unbelievingly
at
the
red
that
seeped
between
her
fingers
easy
now
said
penny
take
it
easy
becky
the
slim
girl
found
the
woman
surprisingly
heavy
to
support
she
was
compelled
to
ease
her
to
the
floor
she
was
only
vaguely
aware
of
the
cries
that
came
from
the
older
children
who
raced
from
beyond
the
curtains
it
it
do
hurt
much
faltered
becky
i
i
should
o
knowed
better
mort
mort
the
one
mebbe
now
you
believe
her
voice
was
weak
so
weak
that
penny
could
barely
understand
what
she
was
saying
rebecca
body
trembled
convulsively
her
eyelids
fluttered
then
opened
wide
and
her
dark
eyes
looked
at
penny
with
a
glaze
over
them
now
she
began
slowly
now
you
believe
this
basin
is
a
nest
killers
the
tired
eyes
closed
penny
lowered
the
woman
head
and
felt
for
a
pulse
she
knew
was
gone
the
children
crowded
around
and
unbelieving
the
oldest
boy
said
now
maw
wo
have
tuh
be
hurt
by
pa
no
more
at
the
brave
look
in
the
pinched
small
face
penny
choked
up
she
gathered
the
lad
to
her
no
billy
maw
wo
have
any
more
pain
of
any
sort
and
do
you
worry
i
going
to
take
care
of
you
little
fellows
she
would
have
said
more
but
another
crash
from
outside
interrupted
she
raced
for
the
window
through
which
the
previous
bullet
had
come
and
saw
a
startling
sight
mort
cavendish
was
clawing
at
his
throat
and
staggering
like
a
drunken
man
but
only
for
an
instant
then
his
legs
caved
as
he
crumpled
to
the
ground
penny
ran
from
the
house
and
splashed
through
the
puddles
on
the
ground
to
where
mort
lay
yuma
running
from
another
direction
reached
the
fallen
man
at
about
the
same
time
stand
back
he
said
i
tend
tuh
things
he
rolled
mort
over
the
wound
in
the
neck
just
beneath
the
jawbone
was
still
clasped
by
the
hand
of
the
unconscious
man
red
moisture
seeped
between
his
fingers
yuma
drew
a
bandanna
from
his
pocket
then
paused
as
he
looked
again
at
penny
i
told
yuh
tuh
stand
back
he
said
i
got
tuh
have
a
look
at
this
wound
go
on
and
have
a
look

the
girl
feel
his
pulse
and
see
if

vamoose
this
may
be
a
pleasant
sight
tuh
see
what
do
you
take
me
for
a
sissy
pull
his
hand
away
and
let
see
how
badly
he
hurt
yuma
nodded
muttering
beneath
his
breath
penny
noticed
that
the
big
cowboy
was
now
fully
composed
and
at
ease
he
seemed
competent
and
direct
in
manner
his
flustered
embarrassment
of
the
corral
was
gone
he
examined
the
wound
with
a
skill
that
showed
familiarity
with
such
things
though
it
bled
profusely
yuma
said
just
grazed
him
i
reckon
he
live
without
no
trouble
if
he
lives
he
hang
he
murdered
becky
said
penny
flatly
and
i
hope
he
lives
yuma
holding
the
bandanna
against
the
wound
looked
at
the
girl
and
spoke
with
an
exasperating
drawl
maybe
you
ai
heard
straight
miss
penny
but
i
tried
tuh
tell
you
a
little
while
ago
that
they
do
hang
killers

this
basin
what
they
do
is
tuh
hire

eat
an
keep
hid
so
the
law

to
let
the
speech

the
time

there
were
other
things
that

blond
yuma

off
the
ground
as
if
he
had
been
a
baby
he
tossed
him
over
one
shoulder
as
he

a
sack
of
flour
and
walked
toward
the
house

by

abruptly
and

into

chapter
ix
bryant
talks
the
wounded
man
in
the
cave
sat
with
his
back
propped
against
the
rocky
wall
fully
conscious
and
aware
of
his
surroundings
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
hours
he
was
able
to
think
clearly
beside
him
there
was
a
broth
and
a
sort
of
biscuit
made
by
tonto
the
food
was
calculated
to
make
rich
blood
and
new
strength
in
the
shortest
possible
time
the
texan
had
slept
fitfully
during
the
day
sipping
the
broth
and
nibbling
food
each
time
he
wakened
now
feeling
well
rested
he
tried
to
piece
the
events
of
the
past
two
days
together
most
of
the
time
was
vague
to
him
he
remembered
that
it
had
been
night
when
he
crawled
wounded
to
the
ledge
after
seeing
silver
desert
him
morning
light
revealed
the
cave
into
which
he
had
crept
with
his
torment
of
pain
tonto
must
have
found
him
then
though
he
could
recollect
nothing
of
the
indian
bandaging
his
shoulder
most
of
that
day
yesterday
slept
then
at
sunset
tonto
had
returned
with
food
and
herbs
to
dress
his
injuries
he
could
remember
much
of
what
happened
after
that
but
there
were
faint
recollections
of
the
indian
crude
but
nonetheless
effective
surgery
followed
by
applications
of
various
sorts
tonto
had
been
with
him
all
night
plying
the
skill
of
the
indian
in
combating
illness
he
remembered
trying
to
ask
tonto
what
had
become
of
silver
but
the
indian
had
said
something
about
waiting
till
he
was
stronger
before
talking
then
tonto
had
left
and
the
wounded
man
had
slept
now
at
sunset
the
indian
was
due
to
return
the
texan
examined
the
food
near
him
and
wondered
where
it
came
from
it
was
wild
turkey
that
might
have
been
shot
by
tonto
neither
was
it
game
that
might
have
been
found
in
the
woods
tonto
must
have
friends
close
by
who
supplied
that
food
a
little
while
ago
the
ranger
had
heard
sounds
that
might
have
been
shots
but
they
were
far
away
he
could
yet
have
implicit
faith
in
all
his
senses
now
he
heard
what
he
thought
might
be
hoofbeats
but
again
he
was
sure
he
waited
and
the
sound
came
nearer
in
a
moment
more
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
rhythmic
tattoo
on
the
rocks
in
the
gap
horses
two
at
least
came
close
and
stopped
a
moment
later
tonto
entered
the
cave
the
indian
looked
gratified
when
he
saw
that
color
had
returned
to
the
face
of
the
texan
he
examined
the
wounded
shoulder
critically
and
announced
that
the
infection
had
gone
down
considerably
and
that
now
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
about
the
ranger
full
recovery
me
leave
camp
on
mountain
the
indian
explained
fetch
um
silver
here
silver
that
right
him
plenty
safe
here
for
time
the
indian
explained
how
huge
rocks
near
the
wall
of
the
gap
made
a
satisfactory
hiding
place
for
both
the
ranger
white
stallion
and
his
own
paint
horse
where
was
your
camp
tonto
tonto
told
about
the
clearing
on
the
side
of
thunder
mountain
and
the
trail
that
led
from
the
clearing
downhill
to
the
basin
and
uphill
to
the
mountain
top
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
it
was
possible
despite
all
rumors
to
the
contrary
to
ride
in
many
directions
then
the
basin
can
be
entered
without
going
through
this
canyon
tonto
nodded
i
always
been
told
that
was
impossible
it
not
impossible
you
see
bimeby
get
rest
first
get
well
then
we
ride
the
wounded
man
was
eager
to
leave
the
cave
and
start
upon
a
campaign
of
vengeance
in
behalf
of
his
fallen
comrades
but
when
he
tried
to
rise
tonto
pressed
him
back
to
his
seat
you
wait
he
said
you
not
ready
yet
the
effort
made
the
ranger
quite
aware
that
he
was
still
weaker
than
he
had
supposed
while
tonto
rebuilt
a
tiny
smokeless
fire
of
very
dry
bits
of
wood
and
prepared
a
new
supply
of
hot
food
he
told
how
the
day
before
he
had
ridden
down
the
gap
to
the
spot
where
the
massacre
had
taken
place
and
then
heard
shooting
far
beyond
he
had
risked
discovery
by
going
as
far
as
the
entrance
of
the
basin
from
there
he
could
see
the
activity
around
the
house
he
saw
mort
body
carried
to
the
big
ranch
house
and
a
little
later
saw
the
girl
penelope
take
the
children
to
the
same
rambling
structure
then
the
body
of
rebecca
had
been
taken
there
he
told
all
this
in
his
jerky
stilted
manner
while
he
put
things
on
the
fire
to
cook
and
then
redressed
the
ranger
wounds
you
need
plenty
more
rest
tonto
told
the
convalescent
man
we
talk
more
bimeby
but
tonto
tell
me
more
about
what
you
seen
did
you
find
or
see
anything
of
my
guns
and
cartridge
belt
talk
more
after
you
strong
have
you
any
idea
who
ambushed
us
me
got
plenty
scheme
the
indian
said
talk
bimeby
it
was
you
who
called
silver
away
from
me
i
remember
your
call
why
did
you
do
that
tonto
refused
to
give
the
texan
any
satisfaction
he
explained
that
he
had
several
things
that
needed
doing
outside
the
cave
and
that
he
was
in
something
of
a
hurry
to
get
away
he
further
impressed
the
wounded
man
with
the
importance
of
rest
then
more
rest
to
give
the
healing
broken
flesh
a
chance
to
mend
beyond
the
danger
of
tearing
open
anew
the
freshly
made
broth
was
and
tasted
good
when
he
finished
drinking
it
the
ranger
felt
drowsiness
creeping
over
him
again
despite
all
of
his
recent
sleep
the
effort
of
even
so
short
a
talk
with
tonto
seemed
to
have
tired
him
he
felt
strangely
secure
now
that
his
indian
friend
was
with
him
the
sleep
he
needed
now
was
natural
sleep
without
the
nightmares
of
the
pain
and
fever
tonto
watched
the
white
man
for
some
time
and
marked
the
regularity
with
which
the
sleeping
man
chest
rose
and
fell
a
trace
of
a
smile
showed
on
the
thin
lips
plenty
rest
the
indian
murmured
him
need
plenty
rest
for
things
to
come
perhaps
tonto
knew
that
he
was
being
prophetic
he
remained
in
the
cave
till
after
darkness
had
fallen
then
he
proceeded
on
a
grim
mission
taking
with
him
a
spade
tonto
knew
from
a
previous
study
of
the
ground
near
the
scene
of
the
massacre
that
no
one
from
the
basin
had
ridden
past
the
dead
men
lying
there
now
in
the
darkness
he
continued
through
the
gap
until
he
reached
the
point
where
it
opened
into
bryant
basin
he
waited
there
watching
the
distant
buildings
for
signs
of
activity
he
wanted
to
make
sure
his
work
of
the
night
could
be
followed
through
without
interruption
he
saw
the
ranch
house
brilliantly
lighted
and
near
by
the
long
row
of
lighted
windows
that
marked
the
bunkhouse
the
dead
men
were
far
from
the
entrance
of
the
gap
it
was
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
walk
on
foot
less
than
that
if
a
man
were
mounted
tonto
knew
his
plans
would
occupy
most
of
the
night
and
he
must
not
be
found
at
work
he
gathered
huge
armfuls
of
dry
stalks
and
dead
shrubbery
and
spread
them
over
the
earth
anyone
entering
the
gap
would
certainly
snap
a
warning
that
would
be
heard
by
tonto
then
the
indian
shouldering
his
spade
turned
his
back
on
bryant
basin
and
the
lighted
house
and
went
to
the
dead
men
inside
the
ranch
house
penelope
sank
exhausted
into
a
chair
before
the
fireplace
her
uncle
sullen
and
morose
looked
up
at
the
girl
get
the
kids
tuh
bed
he
asked
penny
nodded
we
got
to
find
someone
to
take
care
of
them
uncle
bryant
some
older
woman
who
will
come
here
i
already
arranged
fer
that
you
have
wallie
spends
most
of
his
time
in
town
so
i
figgered

more
about
things
there
i
told
him
tuh
hire
a
woman
that
come
here

the
youngsters
wallie
penny
could
conceal
the
contempt
in
her
voice
i
know
he
not
good
fer
much
the
damn
overdressed
lout
but
he
knows
everyone
in
town
from
his
tomcattin
around
he
said
he
c
find
someone
tuh
take
care
of
the
kids
penny
stretched
her
legs
toward
the
fire
and
slouched
back
in
the
chair
the
day
had
been
a
most
strenuous
one
beginning
with
the
surprising
visit
of
rebecca
to
her
room
then
there
had
been
the
ride
up
thunder
mountain
the
meeting
with
tonto
and
the
subsequent
return
with
food
for
the
indian
friend
these
incidents
had
been
made
to
seem
distant
despite
the
hours
by
the
shooting
of
rebecca
and
mort
and
the
endless
details
that
had
to
be
attended
to
because
of
them
with
jeb
bandaging
mort
wound
while
vince
barked
instructions
there
had
been
countless
last
rites
that
had
to
be
performed
for
becky
the
dead
woman
reposed
in
one
of
the
big
house
bedrooms
where
she
would
be
until
the
burial
penny
watched
the
dancing
flames
for
several
minutes
there
were
so
many
things
she
wanted
to
discuss
that
she
hardly
knew
where
to
begin
bryant
was
a
hard
man
at
best
to
talk
to
the
wrong
thing
spoken
and
he
go
into
one
of
his
tantrums
or
retire
to
a
shell
of
stubborn
silence
that
would
tell
her
nothing
jeb
said
you
were
the
one
who
shot
at
mort
the
girl
began
bryant
nodded
i
sensed
things
boilin
up
between
him
an
rebecca
fer
a
long
time
i
did
figure
he
go
as
far
as
killin
his
wife
or
i
done
somethin
before
now
i
heard
the
shot
he
fired
an
hoped
it
gone
wild
that
why
i
shot
tuh
wound
him
then
you
did
intend
to
kill
him
course
not
snapped
bryant
quickly
shot
tuh
wing
him
just
like
i
done
yuh
savvy
that
i
hit
right
where
i
aimed
the
old
man
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
as
he
spoke
making
a
very
definite
point
of
what
he
said
penelope
nodded
but
now
that
mort
is
going
to
recover
he
of
course
be
punished
for
murder
wo
he
bryant
eyes
stared
hard
at
the
girl
who
told
yuh
he
barked
tuh
ask
that
penny
was
surprised
at
his
intensity
why
why
she
stammered
no
one
asked
me
to
you
sure
of
that
of
course
yuh
sure
it
was
that
cowhand
called
yuma
that
put
yuh
up
tuh
out
what
my
intentions
was
regardin
mort
i
have
talked
with
yuma
since
he
carried
mort
here
to
the
house
bryant
leaned
back
eyes
squinting
toward
the
fire
lips
pursed
in
thought
penny
tried
to
study
her
uncle
eyes
was
it
true
that
they
were
failing
if
so
how
could
he
have
fired
with
such
amazing
accuracy
she
remembered
what
jeb
had
said
just
after
the
shooting
men
with
eyes
that
ai
no
good
ca
shoot
a
rifle
bryant
cavendish
was
grumbling
in
an
undertone
run
this
place
all
my
life
built
up
from
nothin
to
one
o
the
best
ranches
in
texas
now
i
ca
turn
without
bein
told
how
tuh
run
my
own
affairs
by
every
saddle
tramp
that
drifts
in
here
fer
work
why
did
you
mention
yuma
asked
penny
i
had
a
row
with
that
upstart
this
afternoon
oh
penny
lifted
her
eyebrows
questioningly
you
did
as
if
i
did
know
what
goin
on
on
my
own
property
why
that
pipsqueak
from
arizona
tried
tuh
tell
me
that
i
was
hirin
outlaws
i
told
him
tuh
mind
his
own
damn
business
an
when
i
wanted
advice
from
him
i
ask
him
fer
it
penny
calculated
that
the
argument
must
have
been
previous
to
her
talk
with
yuma
because
bryant
and
the
blond
cowhand
had
had
no
chance
to
talk
after
the
shooting
which
came
almost
immediately
following
her
discussion
at
the
corral
this
then
could
not
have
been
the
cause
of
the
strange
change
in
yuma
manner
yuma
had
been
almost
antagonistic
when
she
had
met
him
beside
mort
fallen
body
but
uncle
bryant
said
penny
seriously
are
you
sure
you
have
any
outlaws
working
here
you
might
not
know
them
you
see
and
yuma
having
been
outside
the
basin
until
just
recently
that
do
snapped
the
old
man
i
run
this
ranch
without
help
uncle
bryant
do
bite
my
head
off
i
just
curious
what
you
going
to
do
about
mort
i
aim
tuh
think
the
situation
over
speak
tuh
him
when
he
talk
then
make
up
my
mind
you
can
tell
that
yuma
critter
that
if
yore
a
mind
tuh
i
know
what
he
thinks
he
thinks
i
runnin
a
outlaw
hideout
here

i
goin
tuh
let
mort
get
away
with
his
wife
he
be
waitin
tuh
see
what
i
do
well
he
wait
the
subject
was
on
thin
ice
penny
knew
it
would
take
but
little
to
throw
her
uncle
into
a
violent
rage
but
there
were
things
she
must
have
him
answer
in
her
very
best
manner
she
leaned
close
to
the
old
man
uncle
bryant
she
said
softly
are
you
sure
you
can
trust
vince
and
mort
with
the
authority
you
give
them
no
was
the
surprising
reply
i
know
damn
well
i
ca
trust
but
i
got
tuh
i
ca
get
around
myself
an
i
wo
hire
bosses
from
outside
tuh
boss
my
own
flesh
an
blood
i
got
tuh
let
them
worthless
louts
run
things
i
mean
said
penny
then
she
stopped
she
was
at
a
loss
to
know
just
how
to
put
the
question
that
was
foremost
in
her
mind
she
felt
instinctively
that
bryant
was
honest
she
known
her
uncle
many
years
and
had
yet
to
find
him
engaged
in
anything
that
was
otherwise
she
stared
into
the
fire
for
some
time
stern
bitter
unbending
as
the
old
man
was
he
had
been
fair
to
penny
bryant
himself
was
the
first
to
speak
he
seemed
to
be
voicing
mental
ills
that
had
troubled
him
for
some
time
what
choice
have
i
got
he
said
as
if
thinking
aloud
i
know
them
four
nephews
ai
worth
a
damn
if
i
could

disgust
started
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
finished
by
drawing
the
whole
mouth
out
of
shape
well
he
finished
with
murderin
his
wife
i
hated
it
when
he
brought
a

what
a
worthless
pack

an
it
was
seein
the
cavendish
line
propagated
that
riled
me
penny
had
never
heard
her
uncle
speak
in
this
way
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
were
baring
the
secrets
of
his
soul
now
becky
is
dead
he
said
with
resignation
we
see
that
buried
proper
an
take
care
of
the
kids
nothin
more
tuh
do
bryant
pushed
himself
from
his
chair
and
caught
hold
of
the
mantel
over
the
fireplace
he
leaned
partly
against
it
while
he
fumbled
for
his
pipe
and
tobacco
while
he
filled
the
pipe
and
tamped
the
fragrant
weed
down
with
a
thumb
the
old
man
went
on
speaking
i
know
what
folks
think
about
me
penny
he
said
because
i
fought
hard
an
got
rich
an
minded
my
own
business
they
all
quick
tuh
call
me
all
kinds
of
a
crook
bryant
lighted
the
pipe
and
sank
back
to
his
chair
his
stern
manner
relaxed
and
for
a
moment
he
looked
like
a
very
tired
old
man
whose
troubles
were
almost
too
heavy
to
bear
i
know
the
sort
yer
cousins
are
he
said
at
length
god
knows
i
got
where
i
am
by
not
knowin
how
tuh
judge
men
as
well
as
hosses
they
a
pack
o
hungry
buzzards
just
waitin
fer
me
tuh
die
so
they
can
cut
this
property
up
among
if
they
thought
fer
a
second
that
i
was
hard
of
hearin
or
of
seein
or
anything
else
they
pounce
on
that
as
an
advantage
tuh
them
bryant
face
lighted
for
a
moment
i
guess
shootin
mort
like
i
done
will
show
that
i
still
can
shoot
straight
when
i
a
mind
tuh
penny
could
ask
then
if
bryant
eyes
were
failing
he
deny
it
no
matter
what
the
truth
bryant
blew
smoke
toward
the
ceiling
only
one
thing
i
hopin
he
said
i
got
tuh
see
you
taken
care
of
a
rap
on
the
door
broke
off
the
conversation
lonergan
a
new
man
at
the
ranch
was
there
he
was
much
more
suave
than
any
of
the
other
employees
and
seemed
something
more
than
just
a
cowboy
though
he
lived
in
the
bunkhouse
with
the
others
i
been
waitin
fer
you
lonergan
said
bryant
i
ready
cavendish
rose
and
muttered
a
word
of
good
night
to
penny
lonergan
followed
the
old
man
upstairs
to
the
second
floor
and
a
moment
later
penelope
heard
the
door
of
a
bedroom
close
she
went
outside
hoping
the
cool
breeze
of
night
would
blow
some
of
the
confusion
from
her
mind
someone
came
toward
the
porch
from
the
direction
of
the
bunkhouse
with
a
rolling
gait
it
was
yuma
he
doffed
his
hat
when
he
saw
penny
on
the
porch
and
said
i
was
sure
you
be
about
miss
penny
i
hear
that
you
and
uncle
bryant
had
some
words
yuma
the
moonlight
showed
the
serious
look
on
yuma
face
he
nodded
sort
of
why

come
here
i
i
wanted

bryant
an
me
his
rifle

it
drilled
my
hat
here
as
you
see
yuma
stuck
his
finger
through
a
neat
hole
in
his
hat
i
was
fool
enough
tuh
let
bryant
know
that
i
knowed
the
crooks
that

here
he
tried
tuh

me
so
i

home
it
be
downright
unsafe
here
if

bryant
would
it
penny
drew
herself
up
stiffly
are
you
she
demanded
having
a
lot
to
say
for
a
cowhand
mebbe
so
the
cowboy
muttered
i
right
sorry
with
that
he
turned
and
walked
away
penny
sat
down
on
the
steps
more
bewildered
than
ever
she
felt
weak
helpless
against
the
strange
confusion
of
ideas
and
intrigue
suspicions
and
apprehensions
in
the
basin
she
stared
across
the
level
ground
and
saw
the
mouth
of
bryant
gap
brilliantly
lighted
by
the
moon
chapter
x
the
lone
ranger
it
was
daybreak
when
the
man
in
the
cave
wakened
in
surprise
to
find
that
he
had
slept
the
night
through
a
fragrant
aroma
of
coffee
and
bacon
crisping
on
a
fire
made
him
realize
that
he
was
ready
for
a
solid
meal
tonto
looked
up
from
his
cooking
and
grinned
the
texan
felt
of
his
wounded
shoulder
he
was
amazed
at
the
way
the
swelling
had
completely
disappeared
he
could
even
move
his
arm
without
too
much
pain
he
felt
alive
this
morning
he
stood
he
was
a
bit
unsteady
but
his
wounded
foot
would
bear
his
weight
thanks
to
the
manner
in
which
tonto
had
bandaged
it
sunlight
streamed
past
the
opening
of
the
cave
and
turned
the
gap
bright
and
cheerful
cold
water
dashed
into
his
face
made
the
ranger
he
felt
of
his
growth
of
beard
and
turned
to
tonto
i
must
look
like
a
desert
rat
he
said
ruefully
that
easy
to
fix
how
you
feel
tonto
thanks
to
you
tonto
beamed
and
dished
up
fresh
eggs
with
the
bacon
today
he
said
you
get
plenty
well
food
never
tasted
finer
than
that
breakfast
did
when
it
was
finished
the
indian
produced
the
ranger
duffle
which
included
not
only
shaving
materials
but
fresh
clothing
while
the
texan
pulled
off
the
and
remnants
of
the
clothing
he
been
wearing
and
bathed
in
the
cool
stream
the
indian
told
how
he
had
buried
the
men
in
the
canyon
during
the
night
he
explained
that
he
made
six
fresh
graves
though
only
five
men
were
dead
whoever
visited
the
scene
of
battle
and
no
one
from
the
basin
had
yet
done
so
might
wonder
who
had
done
the
burying
but
the
impression
would
be
given
that
all
six
of
the
rangers
had
died
the
trail
would
clearly
show
that
but
six
men
had
ridden
there
and
six
lay
buried
there
would
be
no
search
for
a
survivor
who
might
carry
back
to
town
the
news
of
the
massacre
the
farsighted
indian
had
destroyed
the
trail
made
by
the
one
who
lived
as
he
had
crept
from
the
scene
the
identity
of
the
wounded
man
was
buried
in
an
empty
grave
the
ranger
saw
the
wisdom
in
tonto
scheme
so
far
he
had
no
idea
who
the
killers
were
if
they
knew
he
had
survived
they
would
hunt
him
down
while
he
had
no
conception
of
their
identity
with
the
killers
misguided
into
false
security
he
would
be
left
unmolested
as
long
as
he
recognized
as
a
texas
ranger
when
he
had
finished
dressing
in
the
clean
clothes
and
boots
that
tonto
had
brought
the
texan
sat
beside
the
stream
to
think
tonto
busied
himself
about
the
cave
showing
a
tact
and
understanding
that
was
rare
in
any
man
the
indian
seemed
to
know
that
the
texan
wanted
to
be
left
alone
he
waited
to
answer
what
questions
might
be
asked
the
texan
eyes
fell
upon
a
small
black
book
that
was
on
the
gravel
at
his
side
it
lay
open
to
the
flyleaf
and
there
was
an
inscription
penned
in
the
fine
handwriting
that
engravers
try
so
hard
to
copy
the
man
picked
up
the
bible
and
looked
at
his
mother
words
to
my
son
with
all
my
love
and
a
prayer
that
he
will
carry
with
him
always
the
lessons
we
studied
together
he
remembered
evenings
at
his
mother
side
in
a
pioneer
home
he
recalled
the
time
when
he
had
memorized
the
ten
commandments
reciting
them
then
listening
to
his
father
interpretation
of
the
original
laws
of
living
as
applied
to
life
in
the
new
west
those
laws
had
seemed
so
simple
yet
so
his
father
had
said
that
life
was
supposed
to
be
simple
and
that
only
laws
complicated
things
laws
failed
so
often
as
a
texas
ranger
he
had
seen
rich
murderers
freed
by
juries
while
poor
men
were
jailed
interminably
for
stealing
food
to
ward
off
the
death
of
their
starving
children
law
could
be
relied
upon
to
serve
the
highest
form
of
justice
he
thought
of
his
five
comrades
now
buried
in
an
isolated
gap
what
law
could
punish
their
murderers
how
could
he
find
those
murderers
and
having
found
them
what
proof
would
there
be
against
them
thou
shalt
not
kill
that
was
the
law
yet
who
was
there
to
find
and
punish
those
who
had
already
killed
five
brave
men
he
knew
something
of
the
cavendish
clan
in
the
basin
there
were
men
who
would
probably
give
false
testimony
there
was
unlimited
money
to
be
spent
in
bribes
if
needed
there
was
bryant
cavendish
a
law
unto
himself
against
these
forces
he
stood
alone
and
practically
helpless
in
spite
of
the
odds
against
his
success
the
texan
found
himself
breathing
a
silent
pledge
to
the
souls
of
his
friends
i
find
the
ones
who
did
it
he
whispered
and
i
see
them
made
to
pay
in
full
even
as
he
spoke
he
knew
of
another
pledge
he
made
a
pledge
to
his
mother
that
he
mind
the
precepts
he
had
learned
one
of
these
was
thou
shalt
not
kill
while
pledged
not
to
kill
he
must
confront
hard
men
to
whom
murder
was
a
mere
detail
in
a
day
work
when
and
if
the
showdown
came
after
he
had
found
the
murderers
he
sought
it
would
probably
be
a
case
of
kill
or
be
killed
he
did
mind
dying
if
it
would
serve
his
ends
but
his
own
death
would
in
no
way
avenge
the
lives
of
his
friends
neither
would
it
serve
the
cause
of
justice
by
ridding
the
country
of
inglorious
ravagers
he
found
himself
considering
the
things
in
his
favor
the
fact
that
he
had
survived
the
fight
was
known
only
to
himself
and
tonto
he
would
not
be
recognized
because
of
his
horse
the
only
other
men
who
knew
that
white
stallion
were
dead
he
could
change
his
appearance
by
disguise
if
necessary
he
wondered
if
these
last
few
days
had
already
changed
his
looks
he
felt
he
must
have
aged
considerably
his
outlook
on
life
was
certainly
changed
he
no
longer
felt
like
the
carefree
ranger
he
felt
older
more
serious
more
grim
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
called
tonto
the
indian
advanced
in
his
hand
there
were
guns
holsters
and
a
heavy
cartridge
belt
maybe
now
he
said
you
look
at
guns
the
texan
recognized
the
brace
of
perfectly
matched
and
balanced
revolvers
my
own
tonto
nodded
after
you
fall
other
ranger
take
guns
tonto
find
near
fight
the
weight
of
the
belt
on
his
hips
was
good
it
gave
the
man
a
feeling
of
competence
he
drew
the
guns
and
spun
them
by
the
trigger
guard
reflected
light
splashed
off
the
spinning
weapons
then
the
butts
dropped
in
his
palms
and
the
guns
were
steady
with
those
weapons
the
ranger
had
ridden
a
fast
horse
at
top
speed
and
kept
a
tin
can
bouncing
ahead
of
him
with
bullets
he
could
and
frequently
he
had
done
it
restrain
his
draw
until
fast
had
their
own
weapons
free
of
the
holster
and
still
get
the
drop
on
them
he
broke
one
of
the
guns
and
dumped
the
cartridges
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
you
loaded
them
eh
tonto
nodded
there
was
something
about
the
cartridges
they
gleamed
brilliantly
he
studied
them
a
moment
and
looked
questioningly
at
the
indian
those
bullet
tonto
said
are
silver
it
was
true
the
bullets
in
the
cartridges
were
hard
solid
silver
the
texan
looked
puzzled
that
makes
pretty
shooting
he
said
you
not
shoot
much
tonto
replied
then
he
explained
how
the
precious
metal
for
the
bullets
had
come
from
the
texan
own
silver
mine
tonto
himself
had
cast
the
metal
the
white
man
marveled
at
the
complete
knowledge
tonto
had
of
him
and
of
his
affairs
then
tonto
brought
a
mask
from
beneath
his
buckskin
shirt
it
was
black
and
fashioned
to
cover
the
entire
upper
part
of
a
man
face
effectively
concealing
all
identity
wear
this
tonto
said
the
white
man
hesitated
if
i
go
about
wearing
a
mask
the
law
will
be
in
full
chase
in
no
time
he
said
tonto
nodded
you
outlaw
birds
of
a
feather
by
concealing
his
identity
with
the
mask
his
disguise
would
serve
a
second
purpose
it
would
mark
him
in
such
a
way
that
outlaws
might
welcome
his
company
and
thus
put
him
in
possession
of
information
otherwise
impossible
to
secure
other
ranger
all
dead
said
tonto
as
the
white
man
tried
the
mask
and
found
it
a
perfect
fit
you
only
ranger
now
you
all
alone
all
alone
repeated
the
other
softly
except
for
you
tonto
it
seems
that
it
your
plan
for
us
to
travel
together
tonto
nodded
slowly
soberly
he
held
out
his
brown
hand
again
in
the
palm
there
was
a
metal
badge
the
texas
ranger
badge
the
white
man
took
it
looked
at
it
then
closed
his
fist
about
it
tightly
the
texas
rangers
he
said
softly
are
dead
all
six
of
them
have
gone
in
their
place
there
just
one
man
the
lone
ranger
he
put
the
badge
deep
in
his
pocket
and
murmured
again
the
lone
ranger
chapter
xi
the
lone
ranger
rides
the
lone
ranger
kept
the
mask
across
his
eyes
and
experimented
with
his
guns
his
shoulder
made
it
hard
for
him
to
draw
the
gun
on
his
left
but
he
found
that
his
smooth
speed
seemed
to
have
suffered
no
loss
when
he
drew
the
other
shining
weapon
as
a
test
he
unloaded
and
holstered
the
pistol
i
just
make
sure
he
muttered
to
tonto
standing
with
his
right
hand
straight
before
him
palm
down
he
placed
a
pebble
on
the
back
of
his
hand
he
dropped
the
hand
with
almost
invisible
speed
jerked
out
his
gun
leveled
it
and
snapped
the
hammer
back
then
down
all
this
was
done
before
the
pebble
touched
the
ground
tonto
grinned
at
the
demonstration
and
said
that
do
the
masked
man
sat
down
and
replaced
the
cartridges
in
his
cylinder
so
we
going
to
travel
together
he
said
tonto
nodded
slowly
the
lone
ranger
liked
the
idea
tonto
unequaled
knowledge
of
woodcraft
and
his
skill
in
following
a
trail
that
was
invisible
to
white
men
would
make
him
a
powerful
ally
tonto
told
about
the
cattle
trails
he
found
beyond
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
and
the
trail
that
led
from
the
mountain
top
to
the
clearing
and
beyond
into
the
basin
he
told
of
his
suspicions
that
stolen
cattle
were
harbored
in
the
basin
when
the
masked
man
asked
where
tonto
had
secured
the
food
he
brought
the
indian
evaded
answering
his
pride
had
suffered
when
he
had
been
compelled
to
ask
a
girl
to
help
him
he
felt
just
a
little
bit
like
many
of
the
vagrant
begging
indians
that
were
so
despised
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
nothing
but
the
urgent
need
of
his
friend
would
have
prompted
tonto
to
request
those
favors
and
he
fully
intended
some
day
to
wipe
out
the
obligation
the
lone
ranger
did
press
the
point
tonto
did
however
answer
many
questions
that
had
bothered
the
masked
man
when
he
explained
how
he
happened
to
find
the
cave
he
had
heard
shots
in
the
gap
and
gone
toward
the
sound
scrambling
down
a
rocky
side
of
the
canyon
in
the
dark
he
had
seen
a
white
horse
dimly
outlined
in
the
darkness
he
had
suspected
that
the
horse
was
silver
but
instinctively
he
had
sounded
the
birdlike
trill
that
silver
knew
when
the
big
stallion
came
to
tonto
side
he
saw
that
there
was
no
equipment
behind
the
saddle
and
assumed
that
silver
was
alone
he
had
led
silver
into
hiding
until
dawn
when
he
followed
the
back
trail
to
the
scene
of
murder
signs
there
showed
that
one
man
had
gone
wounded
from
the
scene
he
followed
then
the
trail
until
he
came
to
the
cave
as
simple
as
all
that
the
masked
man
commented
when
tonto
finished
his
recital
if
i
had
been
so
nearly
unconscious
i
have
recognized
your
whistle
the
two
spent
most
of
the
forenoon
making
plans
and
preparations
the
masked
man
wounds
still
bothered
him
but
he
felt
equal
to
a
long
ride
and
he
was
eager
to
get
started
on
his
investigation
he
wore
the
mask
continually
so
it
would
become
a
familiar
part
of
him
and
not
something
strange
that
hampered
his
movements
after
their
noon
meal
the
two
were
ready
with
their
duffle
loaded
on
the
backs
of
scout
and
silver
the
white
horse
seemed
eager
to
be
in
action
once
again
with
his
master
in
the
saddle
he
whinnied
jubilantly
when
the
cinch
was
pulled
tight
and
his
great
strength
showed
in
every
rippling
muscle
beneath
his
snow
white
coat
tonto
mounted
scout
then
waited
the
lone
ranger
placed
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
shouted
silver
the
big
horse
lunged
ahead
the
ringing
clear
voice
cried
as
the
masked
man
settled
in
the
saddle
silver
was
a
white
flame
leaping
ahead
with
silky
mane
and
tail
blown
straight
out
by
the
wind
like
the
plumes
of
a
knight
in
white
armor
sharp
hoofs
hammered
on
the
hard
rocks
in
a
tattoo
that
thrilled
like
rolling
drums
silver
had
his
master
in
the
saddle
tonto
close
behind
him
the
master
voice
rang
out
again
to
echo
both
ways
in
the
canyon
silver
tonto
watching
from
his
saddle
close
behind
the
mighty
silver
whispered
now
lone
ranger
ride
a
stretch
of
flat
tableland
extended
for
several
miles
between
the
rim
of
the
gap
and
the
foot
of
thunder
mountain
after
the
first
thrilling
dash
the
lone
ranger
slowed
silver
to
let
tonto
take
the
lead
and
set
the
route
the
indian
knew
exactly
where
to
go
to
reach
the
top
without
passing
through
the
basin
the
masked
man
was
not
strong
enough
for
great
activity
but
tonto
anticipated
none
for
the
time
being
the
purpose
of
this
trip
was
merely
one
of
observation
the
indian
intended
to
point
out
cattle
trails
he
seen
and
study
them
in
so
doing
he
and
the
lone
ranger
would
get
further
away
from
the
danger
of
the
cave
proximity
to
the
basin
killers
tonto
felt
sure
that
the
ride
would
overtax
the
masked
man
he
knew
his
white
friend
was
perfectly
at
home
in
the
big
saddle
and
perhaps
far
more
comfortable
than
he
be
chafing
with
inactivity
in
the
cave
after
an
hour
or
so
of
riding
the
ground
became
more
rocky
and
difficult
just
ahead
the
mountain
rose
majestically
thunder
mountain
did
divulge
her
secret
dangers
at
first
the
ground
sloped
only
gently
upward
with
an
occasional
large
tree
that
gave
soft
shade
like
a
seductress
in
green
the
mountain
lured
the
stranger
on
with
promises
of
things
that
were
ahead
the
trees
became
more
frequent
then
larger
trees
with
tangled
vines
in
close
embrace
made
travel
harder
as
the
climb
became
steeper
leafy
discards
which
had
rotted
to
soft
loam
gave
birth
to
rank
weeds
the
inclination
increased
so
gradually
that
one
was
aware
that
it
was
changing
the
lone
ranger
realized
quite
suddenly
that
his
horse
was
laboring
the
weeds
had
become
a
crazy
tangle
merging
with
the
vines
that
hung
from
overhead
like
spectral
streamers
there
was
a
constant
clammy
caress
of
invisible
cobwebs
on
the
lone
ranger
face
and
the
less
subtle
sometimes
painful
brushing
of
tree
trunks
against
his
thighs
silver
coat
became
where
briars
and
brambles
raked
the
skin
the
riders
had
frequently
to
crouch
or
be
swept
from
the
saddle
by
low
branches
none
but
tonto
could
possibly
have
followed
this
weird
and
devious
route
daylight
in
the
woods
was
at
best
twilight
human
intrusion
brought
a
constant
cacophony
of
cries
and
chattered
complaints
from
birds
and
beasts
no
breeze
could
possibly
penetrate
this
fastness
and
the
breath
of
the
decaying
things
was
hot
and
fetid
as
it
rose
from
the
ground
the
most
distant
horizon
was
within
arm
reach
underbrush
so
high
that
it
reached
overhead
rose
from
slime
that
was
sometimes
the
ride
seemed
endless
but
the
end
came
without
warning
breaking
through
a
particularly
dense
cover
of
berry
canes
with
briars
that
hurt
the
riders
found
it
clear
ahead
the
land
was
hard
and
almost
arid
a
thought
made
the
masked
man
smile
despite
his
exhaustion
old
thunder
mountain
need
be
so
proud
her
head
was
bald
wind
and
rain
had
swept
the
summit
clean
except
for
a
few
gaunt
stumps
of
trees
tonto
was
at
the
masked
man
side
offering
to
help
him
from
the
saddle

we
rest
he
said
you
need
rest
plenty

able

a

in
the
clear
air
one
could
see
for
miles
from
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
the
basin
most
of
it
at
least
was
hidden
by
the
foliage
but
the
view
in
the
opposite
direction
encompassed
endless
plains
that
led
to
ranches
beyond
the
horizon
the
masked
man
wondered
how
many
of
those
ranches
had
contributed
to
the
crisscrossing
of
cattle
tracks
on
the
bald
dome
where
he
stood
tonto
pointed
out
the
things
that
he
observed
on
previous
visits
and
indicated
where
a
trail
had
been
cut
to
make
a
descent
straight
into
the
basin
meanwhile
most
of
the
people
in
the
basin
went
to
becky
funeral
it
was
a
simple
ceremony
without
tears
conducted
by
jeb

one

feel

for
her
for
having
been
released

held
the
hands
of
the
oldest
children
during
the
burial
she
frequently
felt
the
eyes
of
yuma
standing
unhatted
with
a
number
of
other
men
upon
her
but
each
time
she
looked
at
the
blond
cowboy
he
was
staring
at
the
ground
vince
was
there
and
so

the
cowhands

his

period
as

long
as

ultimately
pronounced

benediction

uncle
bryant
penny
tone
showed
her
surprise
she
knew
that
gimlet
was
one
friend
upon
whom
she
could
count
the
old
cook
had
dandled
her
on
his
knee
when
as
a
child
she
had
come
to
live
in
the
basin
she
listened
eagerly
heard
him
talkin
tuh
that
gambling
named
lonergan
said
gimlet
penny
remembered
that
lonergan
had
called
the
night
before
bryant
had
taken
him
upstairs
behind
closed
doors
curiosity
has
allus
been
my
trouble
an
when
i

talkin
between
them
two
i
did
shut
my
ears
none

the

o
legal
paper
what
about
it
asked
penny
uncle
bryant
has
a
right
to
make
a
contract
or
agreement
with
someone
wal
all
i
know
is
that
i
heard
bryant
ask
lonergan
if
he
was
dead
sure
the
paper
stand
in
court
after
he
was
dead
and
gone
penny
wanted
to
laugh
at
gimlet
obvious
concern
over
what
was
probably
a
will
his
seriousness
however
impressed
her
that
ai
all
said
the
old
man
i
heard
more
i
heard
bryant
he
wanted
tuh
leave
what
he
owned
tuh
them
that
deserved
it
an
he
did
want
none
of
his
damned
relatives
contestin
the
will
in
court
law
but
after
all
gimlet
it
uncle
bryant
ranch
and
he
can

what
he
wants

growled
gimlet
they
a
puncher
here
callin
hisself
what
about
him
yuh
trust
that
big
maverick
miss
penny
he
thinks
a
heap
about
you
penny
said
nothing
gimlet
went
on
with
a
lengthy
discourse
about
the
fine
qualities
of
yuma
he
and
yuma
had
spent
hours
in
close
confab
in
the
kitchen
and
yuma
had
expressed
his
feelings
confidentially
to
gimlet
penny
face
grew
red
as
the
frank
old
man
continued
finally
she
cut
him
off
those
children
are
waiting
for
you
gimlet
all
right
i
tuh
but
you
jest
remember
that
yuma
is
with
me
an
yore
with
gimlet
shuffled
toward
the
kitchen
door
penny
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
surroundings
and
be
alone
with
her
thoughts
she
had
at
least
two
hours
before
her
uncle
would
be
expecting
her
for
the
evening
meal
hurriedly
she
changed
to
riding
clothes
and
left
the
vicinity
on
las
vegas
she
discounted
the
seriousness
of
all
that
gimlet
had
said
about
her
uncle
legal
paper
obviously
just
a
will
the
thing
that
concerned
her
most
was
the
truth
about
bryant
eyes
during
the
day
she
had
tried
to
observe
him
carefully
there
were
times
when
she
was
sure
he
had
trouble
seeing
things
then
she
thought
he
had
truly
fired
at
mort
but
failing
eyes
had
made
his
shot
go
wild
and
coincidence
had
made
it
drill
yuma
hat
there
were
other
times
when
bryant
seemed
to
reach
directly
without
a
trace
of
groping
for
whatever
he
desired
and
then
she
wondered
there
was
no
doubt
in
her
mind
that
vince
and
mort
were
involved
in
something
or
other
that
they
did
want
too
generally
known
what
of
the
men
the
texas
rangers
who
becky
had
said
came
to
investigate
and
died
for
it
lost
in
her
thoughts
the
girl
rode
on
without
thought
or
direction
she
let
the
reins
hang
slack
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
tangle
of
growing
things
that
brushed
past
her
she
was
surprised
when
she
came
back
to
reality
to
find
that
las
vegas
had
carried
her
up
thunder
mountain
she
was
well
beyond
the
lower
part
of
the
path
where
it
was
rough
might
as
well
keep
going
now
she
said
there
was
sugar
in
her
pocket
put
there
for
las
vegas
well
this
time
the
mustang
could
do
without
his
customary
sweet
she
save
it
till
she
reached
the
clearing
and
see
if
she
could
bribe
attention
from
the
silver
stallion
the
did
he
call
himself
tonto
that
was
it
tonto
had
said
that
a
friend
was
wounded
she
wondered
if
by
any
chance
this
friend
could
be
one
of
the
texas
rangers
she
thought
it
quite
unlikely
in
view
of
the
fact
that
all
of
them
were
said
to
have
been
killed
well
she
ask
tonto
anyway
the
clearing
was
just
ahead
she
saw
the
form
of
a
horse
through
the
trees
and
then
a
man
his
back
was
toward
her
she
saw
him
turning
as
he
heard
the
hoofs
approaching
the
man
was
not
her
indian
friend
neither
was
he
a
stranger
to
the
girl
he
was
one
of
the
last
people
in
the
world
she
cared
to
meet
in
such
a
place
the
killer
who
called
himself
rangoon
chapter

help

a
mask
penny
could
turn
back
without
making
herself
appear
ridiculous
rangoon
had
already
seen
her
and
was
grinning
a
welcome
he
took
his
hat
off
with
a
flourish
and
revealed
black
hair
parted
low
on
one
side
and
plastered
down
upon
his
forehead
with
a
carefully
nurtured
dip
his
hair
gleamed
from
greasy
stuff
that
he
used
on
it
wal
he
said
with
the
air
of
a
welcoming
host
this
is
a
downright
surprise
penny
halted
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
rangoon
at
close
range
and
she
found
him
wholly
repugnant
his
face
was
pitted
from
smallpox
scarred
from
a
knife
brawl
and
generally
greasy
with
sweat
but
it
was
his
eyes
that
made
him
hideous
they
were
small
bloodshot
and
set
too
close
together
he
had
only
one
eyebrow
which
extended
clear
across
the
ridge
of
his
receding
forehead
serving
both
eyes
the
expression
in
the
eyes
was
one
of
confidence
and
insolence
instinctively
penny
felt
that
she
should
turn
at
once
and
ride
back
home
rangoon
advanced
on
foot
and
held
a
hand
toward
her
i
help
yuh
down
from
the
saddle
he
said
i
not
dismounting
i
was
just
about
to
turn
back
i
do
reckon
you
want
tuh
turn
back
right
now
rangoon
said
there
somethin
over
here

right
glad

look

penny
tried
to
jerk
the
reins
around
but
rangoon
was
holding
them
please
let
go
of
my
reins
rangoon

rangoon
shook
his
head
slowly

right
sore
if
he
found

in

of

he
said
about

penny
pulled
suddenly
and
hard
but
vainly
it
ai
no
use
tryin
tuh
pull

jest
yet
rangoon
advised
her
because
i
aim
tuh
have
yuh
take
jest
one
look
at
what
i
seen
then
yore
free
tuh
go
if
yuh
want
tuh
penny
was
armed
she
wore
a
revolver
on
a
belt
around
her
waist
she
felt
that
she
could
use
this
if
necessary
she
was
more
angry
than
frightened
she
dismounted
ignoring
the
offered
hand
of
the
man
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
to
say
it
matter
she
noticed
that
his
own
horse
was
tethered
to
a
tree
what
is
it
you
want
to
show
me
i
suppose
rangoon
said
slowly
you
downright
disappointed
that
it
me
yuh
seen
here
instead
of
yer
other
friend
penny
noticed
the
use
of
the
word
other
it
implied
that
in
his
mind
rangoon
had
no
intention
of
considering
himself
in
the
humble
position
of
a
waddie
on
her
uncle
ranch
but
rather
as
one
on
an
equal
social
footing
penny
made
no
comment
yuh
wonder
how
i
know
about
him
eh
rangoon
said
wal
there
is
what
i
wanted
yuh
tuh
see
he
pointed
to
the
ground
penny
saw
the
marks
of
her
small
boots
clearly
showing
where
she
had
stood
yesterday
near
by
were
the
prints
that
tonto
moccasins
had
made
penny
stared
and
felt
herself
growing
cold
with
fury
at
the
realization
of
what
she
knew
must
be
in
rangoon
foul
mind
not
only
were
the
prints
there
together
but
both
pairs
led
toward
the
as
if
it
was
one
of
the
boys
from
the
basin
the
tantalizing
voice
behind
her
said
but
a
critter
wearin
moccasins
that
might
mean
a
redskin
penny
acted
instinctively
she
whirled
quickly
and
swung
with
all
the
force
of
her
arm
her
gloved
hand
smacked
against
the
scar
on
cheek
then
she
burned
with
embarrassment
any
explanation
would
be
futile
she
walked
quickly
toward
her
horse
not
so
fast
rangoon
said
sharply
grabbing
penny
arm
you
let
go
of
my
arm
or
i
shoot
you
the
hell
yuh
will
in
that
instant
penny
was
ready
to
kill
all
reasoning
left
her
the
hand
on
her
arm
brought
her
fury
to
white
heat
she
snatched
for
her
gun
but
rangoon
slapped
the
weapon
from
her
hand
rangoon
released
his
grip
on
her
arm
and
caught
up
the
reins
of
her
horse
jest
git
yer
senses
while
i
tie
up
yer
hoss
an
we
talk
released
the
girl
made
a
dive
for
her
gun
which
was
on
the
ground
rangoon
saw
the
motion
and
put
his
foot
on
the
weapon
i
fix
that
he
growled
he
picked
up
the
gun
and
emptied
it
of
cartridges
now
you
have
the
shootin
iron
back
he
said
handing
it
to
her
while
he
tossed
the
ammunition
deep
among
the
heavy
brush
penny
took
her
weapon
mechanically
and
put
it
empty
in
her
holster
fear
gripped
her
for
a
moment
when
she
realized
that
she
was
practically
helpless
to
turn
and
race
away
on
foot
would
be
a
futile
gesture
she
thought
of
fainting
but
that
would
help
matters
any
she
looked
defiantly
at
rangoon
what
do
you
want
to
talk
about
now
that
more
like
it
yuh
need
be
scairt
of
me
i
do
aim
tuh
hurt
yuh
none
there
was
a
definite
sneer
in
both
the
voice
and
expression
while
the
man
tossed
las
vegas
reins
about
a
tree
and
knotted
them
do

the
notion
that
you

without
no
killin
fights
tied
ontuh
them
penny
stubbornly
refused
to
let
her
face
indicate
her
feelings
she
stood
chin
up
listening
first
of
all
rangoon
said
i
hanker

i
used
to
ride
up
this
way
before
i
went
to
school

came
up
yesterday
and
found
a
friendly
indian
camped
here
why
how
do
i
know

up
here
twice
penny
had
credited
rangoon
with
such
skill
at
reading
signs
yes
i
came
up
twice
the
redskin
had
two
horses
with
him
what
about
penny
while
hating
herself
for
enduring
the
man
insolence
felt
that
there
was
no
use
trying
to
evade
the
truth
which
after
all
was
harmless
she
told
rangoon
about
bringing
food
for
the
indian
friend
when
she
mentioned
the
friend
rangoon
showed
keen
interest
who
was
that
there
friend
i
do
know
where
was
he
at
i
do
know
that
either
i
told
you
all
i
know
rangoon
the
man
shook
his
head
slowly
enough
i
got
tuh
know
the
rest
penny
was
defiant
i
told
you
all
i
know
and
now
i
starting
back
for
the
basin
if
i
not
there
uncle
bryant
will
wonder
why
and
tell
him
why
i
was
delayed
you
ought
to
know
him
pretty
well
rangoon
he
wo
take
this
sort
of
behavior
from
you
rangoon
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
hard
at
this
yer
uncle
wo
hurt
he
said
between
two
roars
of
laughter
penny
made
a
sudden
dive
for
the
knotted
reins
again
rangoon
was
quicker
he
caught
her
in
strong
hands
yuh
ai
leavin
he
said
till
yuh
tell
who
the
redskin
friend
is
an
where
he
hidin
i
tell
you
i
do
know
penny
struggled
to
free
herself
i
wring
it
out
of
yuh
rangoon
bellowed
as
he
wrapped
his
long
arms
completely
around
the
girl
and
nearly
cut
off
her
wind
in
a
bearlike
grip
gasped
penny
rangoon
grip
was
tighter
his
arms
were
crushing
the
slim
girl
to
him
bending
her
back
until
it
hurt
frightfully
his
ugly
face
was
close
to
her
his
breath
foul
with
alcohol
and
teeth
was
hot
penny
felt
nauseated
violently
ill
contact
with
the
girl
made
rangoon
reckless
he
seemed
to
forget
any
fear
he
might
have
had
his
voice
was
hoarse
as
he
shouted
to
penny
who
is
that
friend
his
repeated
question
was
simply
an
excuse
to
hold
the
girl
his
voice
was
hoarse
who
is
that
indian
friend
i
am
it
was
a
new
voice
a
deeply
resonant
one
that
spoke
from
behind
rangoon
stand
back
the
same
voice
snapped
rangoon
swore
and
whirled
as
he
snatched
out
his
gun
with
catlike
speed
and
agility
the
releasing
of
the
girl
the
turning
the
drawing
and
the
firing
all
seemed
part
of
one
smooth
flowing
movement
that
came
from
instinct
penny
saw
rangoon
gun
jump
as
it
lashed
flame
and
smoke
toward
the
newcomer
the
gun
seemed
a
thing
alive
it
leaped
free
of
rangoon
hand
and
flew
in
an
arc
across
the
clearing
rangoon
screamed
a
livid
curse
of
pain
as
he
gripped
his
gun
hand
the
stranger
standing
ten
feet
away
had
his
own
weapon
back
in
its
holster
penny
saw
that
the
man
was
tall
his
hat
was
white
and
clean
and
his
face
was
masked
rangoon
hand
must
have
hurt
terribly
to
judge
from
his
violent
cursing
penny
had
a
dazed
detached
feeling
as
she
watched
the
two
men
rangoon
still
cursing
held
a
hand
that
stung
from
the
force
of
the
bullet
that
had
knocked
his
own
gun
away
the
stranger
with
the
mask
stepped
forward
and
slapped
rangoon
on
the
face
the
blow
did
not
appear
to
be
but
it
sent
rangoon
sprawling
on
the
ground
that
enough
of
that
talk
the
stranger
said
in
his
crisp
but
nonetheless
pleasant
voice
penny
heard
another
sound
and
turned
as
tonto
came
from
behind
the
trees
the
masked
man
spoke
again
you
not
hurt
badly
my
bullet
struck
your
gun
not
your
hand
you
pay
fer
this
rangoon
cried
i
see
yuh
shot
up
a
little
at
a
time
i
have
my
men
git
yuh
you
wait
the
lone
ranger
turned
to
tonto
you
better
gag
him
tonto
he
said
it
going
to
be
hard
to
talk
above
that
noise
tonto
grinned
and
leaped
astride
rangoon
who
made
no
attempt
to
rise
from
the
ground
what
the
killer
said
was
muffled
as
tonto
jammed
a
knotted
cloth
into
his
mouth
when
he
gagged
rope
him
tonto
nodded
and
his
expression
said
gladly
penny
watched
with
interest
she
knew
she
should
mount
and
ride
at
once
for
the
basin
but
there
was
something
about
the
masked
man
that
held
her
and
there
were
things
she
wanted
to
ask
who
was
this
stranger
whose
chin
was
so
well
shaped
why
was
he
masked
she
instinctively
liked
him
aside
from
the
help
he
given
her
she
liked
his
efficient
manner
of
handling
rangoon
beyond
the
trees
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
silver
this
then
was
the
man
to
whom
she
had
sent
food
the
man
for
whom
tonto
had
asked
help
this
was
the
owner
of
the
magnificent
stallion
friend
she
thought
that
who
he
is
tonto
friend
she
remembered
the
way
tonto
had
spoken
of
him
then
understood
the
tone
the
indian
had
used
when
he
said
my
friend
chapter
xiv
the
trail
leads
down
when
rangoon
was
tied
the
lone
ranger
dragged
him
across
the
clearing
and
placed
him
with
his
back
propped
against
a
tree
you
probably
be
here
for
some
time
he
said
i
take
that
gag
out
of
your
mouth
if
you
can
keep
quiet
the
gag
removed
the
masked
man
studied
rangoon
face
for
fully
a
minute
what
your
name
he
asked
rangoon
glared
darkly
from
beneath
the
connected
eyebrows
his
mouth
already
distorted
somewhat
by
the
scar
on
his
cheek
was
drawn
even
further
back
when
he
said
in
a
slow
voice
that
fairly
dripped
with
hate
you
go
tuh
hell
penny
spoke
he
calls
himself
rangoon
the
lone
ranger
nodded
it
seems
to
me
that
i
seen
him
when
he
had
another
name
he
turned
to
penelope
you
of
course
are
penelope
cavendish
he
said
more
as
a
statement
than
a
question
the
girl
nodded
while
her
eyes
remained
fixed
on
the
face
beneath
the
mask
and
the
mask
itself
she
had
noticed
the
slight
limp
when
the
lone
ranger
walked
the
shoulder
bandage
was
covered
by
his
shirt
her
feeling
was
one
of
admiration
and
gratitude
but
most
of
all
resentment
she
felt
that
tonto
had
misled
her
it
was
inconceivable
that
the
man
before
her
could
so
recently
have
been
desperately
in
need
of
food
he
did
look
helpless
he
certainly
had
acted
helpless
when
he
saw
rangoon
yet
tonto
had
implied
that
his
plight
was
serious
perhaps
need
of
concealment
not
starvation
had
kept
the
masked
man
hidden
while
tonto
sought
food
though
penny
liked
his
voice
and
manner
and
the
way
he
handled
rangoon
she
could
judge
him
only
by
facts
and
circumstances
he
had
come
to
the
clearing
rangoon
was
in
the
clearing
was
it
obvious
that
they
came
there
to
meet
rangoon
known
as
an
outlaw
the
newcomer
masked
true
the
masked
man
had
fired
at
rangoon
while
rangoon
fired
at
him
but
was
this
perhaps
an
act
for
her
benefit
neither
man
was
injured
these
were
the
facts
to
tonto
penny
said
i
did
know
your
friend
was
an
outlaw
tonto
began
to
speak
but
penny
continued
if
i
had
i
certainly
would
have
brought
food
for
you
to
take
to
him
the
lone
ranger
spoke
quickly
are
you
the
one
who
brought
tonto
that
food
of
course
did
he
tell
you
no
said
the
masked
man
glancing
at
tonto
he
did
not
tonto
was
highly
uncomfortable
if
i
had
known
where
that
food
came
from
the
lone
ranger
said
i
might
not
have
i
suppose
interrupted
penny
the
fact
that
you
had
food
from
the
cavendish
family
complicates
things
for
you
the
lone
ranger
looked
at
the
girl
somewhat
surprised
she
went
on
speaking
slowly
and
significantly
it
must
make
it
a
trifle
difficult
for
you
to
go
ahead
with
your
plans
could
penelope
know
his
plans
and
suspicions
the
masked
man
tried
to
fathom
the
enigmatic
expression
in
the
girl
face
did
she
know
that
he
felt
a
strong
suspicion
that
her
uncle
was
hiring
crooks
to
bring
stolen
cattle
to
the
basin
did
she
realize
that
his
purpose
was
to
fix
the
guilt
of
murder
on
basin
killers
he
said
it
might
make
everything
more
complicated
than
you
realize
miss
cavendish
he
took
a
step
toward
her
i
want
you
to
understand
one
thing
oh
please
there
was
annoyance
in
the
girl
tone
do
let
talk
any
further
you
helped
me
and
if
you
feel
that
i
helped
you
square
i
sooner
let
it
go
at
that
and
start
for
home
it
ca
go
at
that
the
lone
ranger
said
decisively
the
fact
that
you
saved
my
life
puts
me
in
a
peculiar
position
he
drew
a
cartridge
from
his
belt
take
this
he
said
offering
the
bullet
and
if
there
is
any
man
in
the
world
whose
life
means
a
great
deal
to
you
tell
him
to
carry
it
at
all
times
penny
looked
at
the
silver
bullet
in
the
palm
of
the
masked
man
hand
silver
she
asked
curiously
in
spite
of
herself
yes
so
you
want
to
repay
me
by
agreeing
to
spare
one
life
she
drew
up
proudly
keep
your
bullet
we
are
quite
able
to
defend
ourselves
against
you
turning
abruptly
she
mounted
las
vegas
and
rode
quickly
away
as
penelope
guided
las
vegas
downhill
she
felt
as
if
a
buoyant
hope
had
been
punctured
to
sink
into
a
black
sea
of
despair
her
confidence
in
tonto
had
been
great
and
despite
what
she
had
heard
about
the
murder
of
the
texas
rangers
some
tiny
voice
far
deep
inside
her
kept
whispering
that
she
should
count
on
the
man
whom
the
indian
called
friend
she
had
to
count
on
someone
yuma
thought
that
her
uncle
was
a
leader
of
killers
penny
felt
otherwise
she
had
hoped
somehow
to
find
a
strong
stanch
friend
who
would
feel
as
she
did
seeing
tonto
friend
she
saw
a
masked
man
a
man
who
offered
to
spare
the
life
of
the
one
she
loved
most
in
order
to
repay
her
for
food
now
she
had
no
one
to
turn
to
but
bryant
cavendish
stubborn
bitter
unreasonable
old
man
that
he
was
he
have
to
listen
to
her
he
must
be
made
to
understand
the
forces
that
were
piling
up
in
his
own
home
he
must
be
shown
that
mort
and
vince
were
scheming
with
rangoon
perhaps
with
others
taking
orders
from
an
unknown
chief
ambushing
texas
rangers
murdering
and
heaven
only
knew
what
else
bryant
must
be
made
to
understand
that
his
own
life
was
probably
in
danger
and
must
send
word
out
for
law
men
many
law
men
to
come
and
help
becky
had
got
word
to
the
texas
rangers
bryant
must
find
and
use
the
same
means
but
this
time
they
must
reach
the
basin
without
being
ambushed
bryant
would
be
hard
to
talk
to
but
the
time
for
diplomacy
in
handling
him
was
past
she
rode
on
not
knowing
that
old
gimlet
was
waiting
for
her
with
stunning
news
meanwhile
instead
of
replacing
the
silver
bullet
in
his
cartridge
belt
the
lone
ranger
put
it
in
his
pocket
he
drew
the
indian
aside
out
of
hearing
of
rangoon
do
you
see
the
spot
we
in
now
tonto
if
bryant
cavendish
is
in
charge
of
the
basin
as
he
always
been
he
the
man
we
want
alive
to
get
him
only
because
of
what
his
niece
did
for
me
she
may
have
given
me
a
life
that
i
dedicated
to
the
hanging
of
the
man
she
cares
for
i
got
to
know
her
feelings
tonto
nodded
his
agreement
looking
quite
dejected
i
do
think
bryant
himself
did
the
killing
tonto
but
unless
things
have
changed
since
the
last
reports
came
out
of
bryant
basin
he
rules
his
little
kingdom
with
a
mailed
fist
and
there
is
a
thing
that
goes
on
there
that
he
does
order
if
killers
are
there
he
brought
them
there
the
texas
rangers
must
have
died
because
bryant
cavendish
sent
men
out
to
kill
them
tonto
studied
the
tall
man
eyes
and
noted
that
there
was
a
new
intensity
in
the
gray
depths
maybe
now
he
said
we
camp
you
need
rest
there
is
time
to
rest
now
penelope
cavendish
believes
i
one
of
the
outlaws
if
she
thinks
bryant
is
on
the
level
and
tells
him
about
seeing
me
he
make
things
too
hot
we
got
to
strike
before
he
can
act
it
soon
be
dark
enough
to
get
to
the
cavendish
house
without
being
seen
and
i
going
there
cavendish
is
an
old
man
at
best
he
has
many
years
to
live
his
niece
if
she
loves
him
can
keep
him
but
we
going
to
take
the
killers
that
work
for
him
and
he
going
to
give
us
the
evidence
that
will
hang
them
the
lone
ranger
spoke
softly
but
with
a
calm
determination
that
told
tonto
there
was
little
use
in
trying
to
persuade
him
to
postpone
a
meeting
in
a
murderers
retreat
what
more
the
lone
ranger
finished
he
going
to
put
that
evidence
in
writing
tonto
go
with
you
the
indian
said
we
leave
rangoon
feller
tied
here
no
tonto
i
going
alone
tonto
tried
to
convince
the
lone
ranger
that
he
was
risking
his
life
that
he
needed
help
that
he
should
not
ride
unaccompanied
into
the
basin
but
the
masked
man
shook
his
head
my
plans
are
better
tonto
we
going
to
leave
rangoon
here
by
the
trail
these
men
use
in
going
from
the
basin
to
the
outside
the
first
ones
who
come
through
here
will
find
him
they
release
him
and
there
will
be
some
talk
i
want
rangoon
to
think
that
both
of
us
have
ridden
to
the
basin
we
start
out
down
the
trail
but
you
turn
back
and
hide
near
by
to
hear
what
said
i
ride
into
the
basin
have
a
showdown
talk
with
cavendish
and
meet
you
later
in
our
cave
in
the
gap
the
masked
man
pointed
out
how
tonto
natural
abilities
made
him
the
logical
one
to
wait
in
the
forest
no
white
man
could
maintain
the
vigil
with
the
absolute
silence
that
was
so
imperative
on
the
other
hand
the
indian
scant
knowledge
of
white
men
laws
and
courts
of
law
made
him
a
poor
one
to
dictate
the
sort
of
statement
that
must
be
secured
from
bryant
cavendish
the
two
returned
to
the
proximity
of
rangoon
and
made
ready
to
start
riding
yuh
ca
leave
me
here
the
outlaw
shouted
the
lone
ranger
looked
at
him
and
said
deliberately
why
not
what
if
i
starve
what
if
i
et
up
by
animals
that
retorted
the
masked
man
would
be
easier
than
the
way
the
snake
flats
homesteaders
died
when
abe
larkin
killed
them
rangoon
eyes
went
wide
at
the
mention
of
the
name
he
formerly
had
used
and
the
people
he
had
killed
what
know
about
them
he
cried
the
law
is
still
keeping
a
noose
ready
for
abe
larkin
where
yuh
goin
there
was
panic
in
rangoon
voice
as
he
saw
the
two
mount
and
point
their
horses
toward
the
basin
the
lone
ranger
said
come
on
silver
rangoon
tugged
at
his
ropes
struggled
with
them
until
his
wrists
were
almost
bleeding
his
courage
as
darkness
fell
in
the
woodland
clearing
ebbed
until
he
was
reduced
to
a
sniveling
sobbing
wretch
with
scant
resemblance
to
the
swaggering
monster
that
had
bullied
penelope
who
he
cried
aloud
who
was
he
who
in
god
name
was
that
masked
man
with
the
silver
bullets
he
called
me
abe
larkin
who
in
god
name
was
he
somewhere
unseen
in
the
darkness
a
crouching
indian
grinned
chapter
xv
intrigue
comes
closer
when
penny
reached
home
just
after
dark
she
noticed
a
peculiarly
deserted
air
about
the
ranch
most
of
the
horses
belonging
to
the
cowboys
were
gone
from
the
corral
when
she
turned
las
vegas
in
the
shack
where
becky
had
lived
was
dark
and
the
big
house
nearly
so
there
was
one
lamp
burning
in
the
living
room
and
the
kitchen
wing
was
lighted
that
was
all
the
usual
bunkhouse
sounds
of
laughter
or
murmuring
voices
against
an
occasional
accordion
or
guitar
background
were
not
there
penelope
entered
by
the
kitchen
door
gimlet
rose
to
greet
her
with
anxiety
showing
in
every
one
of
the
enumerable
lines
on
his
battered
old
face
burst
out
gimlet
where
you
been
penny
was
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
old
man
obvious
agitation
what
the
matter
gimlet
is
anything
wrong
that
jest
it
i
dunno
it
seems
like
all
hell
due
tuh
bust
loose
an
yet
they
ai
a
thing
i
put
a
finger
on
they
things
up

scared
damn
near
tuh
death
somethin
happened
tuh
you
but
why
yuh
sure

yuh
yuh
ai
met

no
trouble
what
kind
of
trouble
where
is
everyone
i
dunno
what
kind
jest
trouble
trouble
like
bein
shot
at
or
like
havin
threats
made
at
yuh
penny
shook
her
head
i
rode
quite
a
way
she
said
and
realize
it
was
so
late
where
is
uncle
bryant
it
was
when
gimlet
replied
that
penny
felt
her
first
frustration
gone
an
god
knows
where
to
or
why
gone
echoed
the
girl
did
he
say
anything
he
come
here
tuh
the
kitchen
told
me
tuh
pack
some
vittles
in
a
sack
an
stayed
while
i
done
it
he
took
the
sack
it
intuh
the
buckboard
which
same
had
two
strong
hosses
all
hitched
then
fetched
mort
outen
the
house
with
his
neck
still
bandaged
an
the
two
druv
off
penny
had
known
bryant
to
leave
the
basin
in
years
yet
she
knew
gimlet
must
be
telling
the
truth
did
he
say
when
he
was
coming
back
she
asked
not
a
damn
word
penny
had
counted
on
a
talk
with
her
uncle
now
that
the
talk
was
out
of
the
question
at
least
for
the
time
being
she
felt
a
hopelessness
that
made
her
aware
of
how
much
she
had
counted
on
that
talk
how
long
ago
she
said
did
uncle
bryant
leave
jest
a
little
while
after
the
argyment
argument
what
argument
him
an
that
cowboy
callin
himself
yuma
had
another
yuma
in
her
confusion
of
emotions
penny
could
do
little
more
than
echo
what
gimlet
said
i
tell
yuh
they
been
things
goin
on
but
nothin
i
lay
a
finger
on
bryant
an
yuma
talked
low
fer
a
time
then
both
got
tuh
howlin
i
c
hear
some
o
what
said

was
callin
on
bryant
tuh

to
it
that
mort

what
he
deserved
an
got
told
tuh

tuh
hell
that
what
uncle
bryant
would
tell
him
yuma
said
he
done
some
thinkin
since
the
last
row
they
had
an
he
figgered
that
if
mort
was
given
what
a
killer
sh
git
it
was
because
bryant
did
give
a
damn
what
went
on
in
the
basin
oh
if
yuma
could
only
understand
uncle
bryant
said
penny
uncle
bryant
ca
be
bulldozed
into
doing
anything
one
way
to
make
certain
he
does
turn
mort
over
to
the
law
is
to
order
him
to
do
it
they
had
aplenty
o
hot
words
said
gimlet
shaking
his
head
slowly
they
was
a
heap
o
cussin
on
both
sides
when
i
heard
what
bryant
told
about
the
shootin
of
becky
i
was
fit
tuh
be
tied
i
was
so
mad
what
did
he
say
asked
penny
eagerly
said
that
mort
told
him
he
never
had
no
intent
o
shootin
becky
penny
lips
compressed
mort
claimed
that
he
seen
a
snake
a
rattler
an
a
big
one
an
he
was
shootin
at
that
same
but
his
shot
went
wild
an
through
the
window
tuh
git
his
wife
so
said
penny
softly
that
the
story
he
going
to
tell
he
told
it
an
bryant
told
it
an
i
reckon
it
stand
hai
no
way
tuh
prove
otherwise
no
responded
the
girl
her
confidence
in
uncle
bryant
severely
threatened
there
no
way
to
prove
otherwise
i
saved
some
chow
fer
yuh
gimlet
said
in
an
incidental
way
if
yuh
want
it
i
reckon
yore
hungry
penelope
shook
her
head
i
not
hungry
gimlet
i
dunno
what
goin
tuh
happen
the
old
man
said
sadly
i
do
know
one
thing
though
an
that
jest
this
becky
was
kilt
by
no
accident
an
if
bryant
says
she
was
he
as
big
a
damn
liar
as
mort
penny
looked
at
gimlet
she
laid
one
hand
on
his
skinny
forearm
below
the
shirtsleeve
softly
she
said
gimlet
have
you
any
idea
why
rebecca
was
shot
gimlet
dropped
the
gaze
of
his
one
eye
to
the
floor
and
shifted
his
weight
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
tell
me
said
penny
i
want
to
know
gimlet
nodded
slowly
i
know
he
said
that
what
made
me
afeared
fer
you
he
stopped
there
and
penny
said
go
on
gimlet
drew
a
deep
breath
as
if
in
telling
the
girl
what
he
knew
he
were
leaping
into
a
bottomless
pit
filled
with
icy
water
i
i
the
one
that
got
her
kilt
penny
waited
knowing
that
when
he
enlarged
on
the
amazing
statement
it
would
be
vastly
modified
i
could
o
helped
it
though
i
dunno
where
becky
learned
that
a
pack
o
killers
from
all
parts
o
the
state
was
bein
brought
tuh
jobs
here
so
they
c
hide
while
they
stole
hosses
an
cattle
from
outside
the
basin
she
knowed
it
though
an
sent
me
with
a
note
intuh
captain
blythe
in
red
oak
i
gave
him
the
note
an
left
like
she
tol
me
tuh
do
i
dunno
how
the
crooks
here
learned
about
it
but
they
sure
as
hell
was
ready
when
the
texas
rangers
rid
through
the
gap
they
wiped
out
aplenty
but
there
be
other
rangers
coming
to
see
what
happened
to
them
said
penny
an
alibis
an
lies
aplenty
waitin
fer
them
same
by
the
time
the
next
rangers
git
here
there
wo
be
a
damn
thing
fer
tuh
see
the
stolen
cattle
have
new
brands
an
the
crooks
that
hidin
here
will
be
hidin
where
they
cai
be
found
no
one
know
nothin
about
nothin
penny
nodded
slowly
realizing
the
truth
in
what
old
gimlet
said
if
it
knowed
by
the
crooks
that
you
know
what
goin
on
they
do
tuh
you
the
same
as
they
done
tuh
becky
as
fer
me
i
expectin
tuh
git
kilt
most
any
time
you
said
there
was
anything
you
could
put
your
finger
on
gimlet
it
seems
to
me
you
know
just
about
all
there
is
to
know
ca
prove
nothin
though
that
i
dunno
where
bryant
stands
i
wish
i
knew
that
said
penny
thoughtfully
one
thing
sure
as
long
as
he
here
there
wo
no
harm
come
tuh
you
let
him
git
killed
though
as
i
know
damn
well
he
expectin
god
knows
what
happen
thing
i
dunno
is
who
is
things
vince
gimlet
shook
his
head
too
cussed
fer
any
man
tuh
take
orders
from
mort
again
the
old
man
head
moved
slowly
from
one
side
to
the
other
i
do
think
so
we
figger
jeb
an
wallie
out
as
a
matter
o
course
maybe
they
know
what
goin
on
maybe
they
do
jeb

the
brains
of
a
jackass
an
wallie
ai
hardly
ever
home

he
returned
from

nope

tomcat
around

more
an
maybe

a
woman
tuh
raise
becky
kids
he
ai
come
back
yet
where
have
the
other
men
gone
they
moseyed
out
soon
after
the
buryin
i
dunno
where
they
went
vince
an
some
o
them
are
in
the
front
room
o
the
house
who
is
with
vince
sawtell
an
lombard
an
the
man
that
talked
with
bryant
night
lonergan
they
been
chewin
the
rag
in
there
ever
since
bryant
took
mort
away
gimlet
turned
to
the
huge
stove
and
shoved
a
pan
back
from
the
heat
yuh
sure
yuh
wo
eat
he
asked
penny
felt
that
food
would
choke
her
she
wondered
if
there
were
anyone
in
the
world
to
whom
she
might
turn
in
confidence
and
trust
the
door
swung
open
suddenly
and
yuma
stood
in
the
opening
the
big
blond
cowboy
face
was
grim
he
glanced
at
gimlet
then
the
girl
saw
yer
hoss
in
the
corral
he
explained
i
got
tuh
ask
yuh
jest
one
thing
miss
penny
penny
nodded
without
speaking
she
noticed
that
yuma
wore
two
guns
both
tied
low
his
hat
was
well
down
on
his
forehead
and
he
had
a
leather
jacket
over
his
shirt
he
seemed
to
be
dressed
for
a
considerable
ride
jest
one
thing
he
repeated
ponderously
well
what
is
it
i
fixin
tuh
pull
stakes
the
cowboy
said
yuh
do
know
me
very
well
an
yuh
got
no
reason
tuh
trust
me
exceptin
that
i
tell
yuh
on
the
level
i
know
what
i
sayin
will
sound
crazy
loco
an
yuh
pay
no
attention
tuh
it
but
i
wantin
tuh
take
you
intuh
red
oak
see
yuh
outen
this
hell
basin
they
folks
there
that
make
yuh
right
tuh
home
you
c
teach
school
if
yuh
wanted
tuh
will
you
leave
right
now
of
course
not
retorted
penny
yuma
nodded
slowly
that
what
i
figgered
i
be
there
though
if
ever
yuh
need
me
penny
could
never
know
how
yuma
had
steeled
himself
to
make
the
extravagant
suggestion
the
cowboy
knew
there
was
a
chance
that
penny
would
agree
and
when
he
saw
the
scornful
look
he
had
no
more
to
say
no
argument
to
put
forth
he
had
made
his
request
and
it
had
been
turned
down
his
simple
and
straightforward
way
of
thinking
had
grasped
the
thing
in
the
same
way
that
penny
did
he
knew
the
girl
was
in
a
dangerous
place
and
wanted
to
take
her
from
it
make
her
safe
she
refused
to
go
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
the
door
closed
and
penny
was
about
to
voice
her
indignation
but
gimlet
spoke
first
the
old
man
said
more
soberly
than
he
spoken
before
miss
penny
yuh
should
o
gone
why
the
nerve
of
that
crazy
cowboy
i
do
even
know
his
name
been
here
only
a
short
time
he
fought
twice
with
uncle
bryant
and
told
me
what
he
thought
of
the
only
man
in
the
world
i
ever
cared
for
my
uncle
and
now
he
expects
me
to
leave
home
and
go
off
to
red
oak
teaching
school
leave
here
tonight
with
him
it
the
most
ridiculous
outlandish
nonsense
i
penny
stopped
for
breath
gimlet
said
again
yuh
should
o
gone
i
should
huh
retorted
penny
i
have
to
be
gagged
and
to
go
with
that
crazy
wrangler
and
even
then
i
fight
every
inch
of
the
way
she
turned
abruptly
and
pushed
through
the
door
into
the
living
quarters
of
the
house
gimlet
blinked
when
the
door
slammed
almost
in
his
face
he
fingered
his
mustache
reflectively
and
through
his
knobby
nose
gagged
an
eh
he
muttered
but
mebbe
that
a
good
idee
he
hurried
across
the
kitchen
in
a
busybody
sort
of
stride
and
followed
yuma
into
the
darkness
penny
hoped
to
get
upstairs
and
to
her
bedroom
without
having
to
talk
any
further
her
mental
state
was
in
the
lowest
depth
of
despondency
she
ever
known
it
seemed
that
the
more
she
learned
the
more
futile
it
became
to
look
ahead
to
happiness
in
bryant
basin
her
nerves
felt
drawn
to
a
tension
that
threatened
to
snap
them
like
catgut
drawn
too
tightly
on
a
violin
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
that
could
happen
now
made
a
great
deal
of
difference
she
turned
a
corner
of
the
hall
and
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
stood
vince
cavendish
at
the
sight
of
his
cousin
vince
shoulders
seemed
to
droop
and
his
eyes
assumed
a
woebegone
expression
that
was
something
new
he
advanced
to
the
girl
and
said
god
knows
what
goin
tuh
happen
to
us
cousin
penny
had
never
heard
vince
speak
in
that
sort
of
tone
she
looked
at
him
suspiciously
wondering
what
was
behind
the
beaten
manner
that
was
like
a
plea
for
sympathy
she
moved
her
hand
behind
her
as
vince
sought
to
take
it
in
his
own
what
the
matter
with
you
she
demanded
you
act
like
a
sick
calf
vince
said
hollowly
by
uncle
bryant

sold

that

penny
turned
to
go
upstairs
but
sawtell
stocky
figure
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
flight
his
voice
was
soft
and
smooth
to
match
the
bland
expression
of
his
wide
face
miss
cavendish
he
said
as
he
started
down
the
stairs
i
glad
you
back
we
something
to
talk
about
you
nothing
to
talk
about
with
me
the
girl
said
to
the
descending
man
any
business
you
have
for
uncle
bryant
can
wait
until
he
gets
back
here
sawtell
smiled
i
guess
you
do
understand
he
wo
be
back
here
until
we
take
some
documents
to
him
with
your
name
and
the
names
of
your
cousins
signed
to
them
he
halted
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
and
took
a
folded
paper
covered
with
close
writing
from
his
pocket
shall
we
go
into
the
other
room
he
said
you
can
do
what
you
want
i
going
to
bed
retorted
the
girl
starting
once
more
sawtell
gripped
her
arm
let
go
of
me
i
do
want
to
use
any
harsh
methods
miss
cavendish
sawtell
said
with
his
smile
gone
and
an
impatient
edge
to
his
voice
but
i
promise
you
you
going
to
sign
the
agreement
so
we
can
start
for
town
as
soon
as
possible
penny
jerked
her
arm
free
she
felt
panicky
helpless
but
dared
not
show
it
her
gun
was
still
on
the
belt
about
her
waist
but
the
cartridges
it
had
held
were
somewhere
in
the
brush
on
thunder
mountain
she
was
determined
to
get
to
her
room
bar
the
door
and
stay
there
until
her
uncle
came
home
no
matter
what
bryant
did
she
knew
that
he
would
let
nothing
serious
happen
to
her
it
was
incredible
that
left
instructions
such
as
vince
had
told
her
about
with
men
like
sawtell
and
lombard
she
wondered
about
lombard
and
lonergan
gimlet
had
said
they
were
here
in
the
house
upstairs
it
was
quite
possible
the
girl
looked
toward
the
front
door
then
at
sawtell
there
no
use
putting
us
all
to
a
lot
of
extra
trouble
sawtell
told
her
you
only
make
it
harder
for
yourself
he
right
put
in
vince
in
a
resigned
voice
they
ai
no
use
puttin
off
the
signin
o
that
paper
might
as
well
do
it
an
git
it
done
with
penny
jaw
was
firm
i
wo
do
anything
until
i
talk
to
uncle
bryant
sawtell
nodded
slowly
all
right
then
we
have
to
bring
jeb
down
here
he
called
curt
orders
up
the
stairs
and
in
a
moment
jeb
struggling
between
lonergan
and
lombard
was
practically
carried
down
the
stairs
his
eyes
were
wide
and
staring
and
his
lean
face
white
with
terror
do
what
they
want
he
cried
to
the
girl
no
matter
what
it
is
you
sign
it
like
what
i
done
if
yuh
do
they
brand
me
with
a
poker
take
him
to
the
fireplace
ordered
sawtell
put
some
ropes
around
him
then
come
back
for
vince
this
girl
will
do
what
bryant
says
or
she
see
slow
murder
with
a
lot
of
pain
no
no
cried
vince
not
me
as
if
by
magic
a
gun
appeared
in
sawtell
hand
he
said
as
well
as
jeb
penny
watched
the
jeb
and
the
cringing
wincing
vince
being
dragged
howling
to
the
fireplace
where
lombard
and
lonergan
tossed
ropes
about
them
the
two
were
jerked
off
their
feet
and
stretched
on
the
floor
and
more
ropes
looped
about
their
ankles
made
them
helpless
sawtell
gun
still
in
hand
watched
the
procedure
unmoved
and
expressionless
lonergan
black
eyes
reflected
the
leaping
flames
when
he
faced
sawtell
his
black
mustache
so
carefully
brushed
and
tapered
seemed
to
twitch
with
his
eagerness
to
make
the
next
move
sawtell
nodded
and
the
former
gambler
grabbed
the
poker
in
lean
fingers
and
shoved
it
deep
among
the
coals
stark
terror
from
their
souls
showed
in
the
eyes
of
the
captured
men
vince
drooled
supplications
for
mercy
begging
penny
to
sign
bryant
agreement
and
save
him
from
the
torture
of
the
heated
iron
jeb
wailed
conglomerate
quotations
misquoted
from
the
scriptures
sawtell
approached
penelope
you
have
a
few
minutes
to
think
it
over
he
said
while
the
iron
gets
have
you
ever
heard
a
man
scream
with
the
pain
of
being
branded
he
paused
lowered
his
voice
and
added
in
the
eyes
chapter
xvi
sees
death
the
lone
ranger
stood
close
to
his
horse
at
the
edge
of
the
basin
where
thick
foliage
marked
the
beginning
of
the
rise
of
thunder
mountain
he
strained
his
eyes
and
ears
to
detect
what
he
could
in
the
basin
motionless
and
tense
the
masked
man
waited
like
a
hunter
that
tried
to
catch
a
scent
from
a
wind
that
held
its
breath
he
heard
the
usual
night
sounds
of
cattle
katydids
and
frogs
there
was
an
occasional
call
from
a
creature
of
the
forest
that
rose
behind
him
nothing
more
on
the
downward
path
the
masked
man
had
met
no
one
he
had
dismounted
on
several
occasions
to
examine
the
trail
by
matchlight
and
near
the
bottom
where
it
was
overgrown
with
weeds
he
had
lighted
a
candle
to
inspect
it
further
he
found
that
many
head
of
cattle
had
traveled
where
the
path
was
smooth
but
the
beef
had
been
fanned
out
in
many
directions
near
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
and
driven
into
the
basin
at
several
points
he
decided
that
this
had
been
done
so
that
a
path
would
not
be
seen
from
the
basin
itself
the
lone
ranger
guided
silver
back
among
the
trees
where
the
white
coat
would
be
so
obvious
if
someone
rode
near
he
whispered
softly
then
left
the
horse
untethered
he
paused
to
make
sure
that
his
mask
was
snugly
in
place
it
had
become
so
much
a
part
of
him
that
he
could
be
sure
of
its
presence
unless
he
felt
it
with
his
hand
when
tonto
had
at
first
suggested
wearing
the
mask
all
the
time
he
had
thought
it
a
bit
dramatic
perhaps
even
silly
but
consideration
made
him
realize
that
he
already
was
hampered
by
the
determination
not
to
shoot
to
kill
by
great
odds
and
by
the
weakness
of
his
wounds
and
recent
fever
he
might
have
to
fight
to
rope
and
shoot
and
the
mask
must
be
no
handicap
he
checked
his
guns
making
sure
that
they
were
fully
loaded
by
replacing
the
shell
that
had
been
used
to
disarm
rangoon
then
he
was
ready
an
experienced
black
cat
stalking
a
nervous
bird
could
be
no
more
quiet
than
was
the
lone
ranger
as
he
moved
across
the
basin
his
clothing
had
no
flapping
superfluities
he
wore
no
jingling
spurs
his
guns
were
tied
down
so
that
the
holsters
could
not
slap
his
legs
boots
oiled
to
preclude
the
slightest
possibility
of
any
squeaking
leather
he
moved
swiftly
and
surely
toward
the
buildings
of
the
ranch
he
saw
the
house
and
not
far
from
it
the
row
of
lighted
squares
that
marked
the
bunkhouse
halfway
to
the
buildings
the
lone
ranger
froze
he
wondered
if
his
eyes
were
playing
tricks
or
if
he
actually
had
seen
someone
or
something
move
at
one
end
of
the
bunkhouse
now
he
saw
a
moving
figure
in
the
beam
of
light
that
slanted
from
a
rear
window
in
an
instant
whatever
he
saw
was
obscured
by
the
darkness
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
silver
was
well
out
of
sight
his
own
dark
clothing
would
be
barely
visible
unless
someone
were
quite
close
to
him
then
he
heard
the
sound
of
hoofs
a
horse
and
rider
appeared
as
a
vague
shadow
against
the
lighted
bunkhouse
windows
the
masked
man
dropped
flat
on
his
stomach
hugging
the
ground
as
closely
as
possible
the
rider
was
coming
straight
toward
him
he
drew
a
pistol
holding
it
in
readiness
if
he
should
be
seen
he
knew
that
his
hat
was
light
and
might
attract
attention
but
he
dared
not
move
it
he
felt
the
ground
tremble
with
the
beat
of
hoofs
he
heard
the
crack
of
a
quirt
cruelly
applied
and
a
man
husky
voice
now
the
rider
was
almost
upon
him
without
slackening
his
speed
the
racing
horse
looked
tremendous
as
it
passed
within
twenty
feet
of
the
lone
ranger
it
was
impossible
to
tell
who
was
in
the
saddle
all
details
were
shrouded
by
the
darkness
but
whoever
that
horseman
was
he
was
in
a
hurry
he
swept
across
the
basin
toward
the
foot
of
thunder
mountain
and
the
last
the
masked
man
saw
was
the
barely
perceptible
shadow
breaking
through
the
underbrush
that
hid
the
uphill
trail
the
lone
ranger
presently
rose
to
his
feet
waited
several
seconds
and
then
moved
ahead
again
this
time
his
destination
was
the
bunkhouse
he
could
call
on
bryant
and
penelope
later
first
he
would
investigate
to
learn
if
possible
the
reason
for
the
unknown
rider
sudden
departure
there
was
no
sound
from
within
the
bunkhouse
the
masked
man
advanced
toward
the
side
of
the
long
and
rather
narrow
building
the
rear
from
which
the
unknown
rider
had
started
was
on
his
right
the
front
of
the
building
on
his
left
he
could
see
that
a
door
which
opened
out
was
wide
but
from
his
point
of
view
the
lone
ranger
could
see
the
inside
of
the
place
he
could
hear
something
going
on
inside
the
ranch
house
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
away
but
could
distinguish
the
sounds
clearly
enough
to
know
what
they
might
mean
go
there
he
muttered
later
on
with
increasing
caution
he
approached
the
objective
until
his
back
was
pressed
close
to
the
slab
side
of
the
bunkhouse
at
the
corner
between
the
lighted
windows
and
the
open
door
still
there
was
no
sound
inside
his
gun
in
readiness
he
rounded
the
corner
and
looked
in
the
door
he
saw
a
room
bunks
lined
each
of
the
side
walls
divided
by
a
narrow
aisle
in
the
front
part
of
the
room
there
was
one
large
table
and
several
chairs
at
least
twenty
men
slept
here
but
now
there
was
no
one
in
sight
the
table
had
held
a
poker
game
which
seemed
to
have
been
interrupted
suddenly
freshly
dealt
cards
lay
face
down
on
the
table
as
they
had
fallen
before
the
chairs
of
the
players
the
room
was
littered
with
battered
pictures
extra
boots
blanket
rolls
and
other
paraphernalia
that
would
naturally
be
accumulated
by
those
who
slept
there
the
lone
ranger
stepped
inside
and
drew
the
door
shut
behind
him
at
the
poker
table
he
paused
and
examined
a
few
of
the
cards
riffling
through
them
he
came
across
two
aces
he
held
these
cards
close
to
a
lamp
and
studied
their
backs
in
one
corner
he
found
a
barely
discernible
indentation
that
might
have
been
made
by
a
fingernail
he
nodded
slowly
looks
like
it
might
be
slick
lonergan
he
mused
slick
had
been
seen
in
any
of
his
familiar
haunts
since
the
time
he
had
disappeared
before
a
trial
in
which
he
was
to
be
questioned
about
a
murder
the
lone
ranger
knew
lonergan
entire
background
a
crooked
gambler
a
crafty
lawyer
and
a
shrewd
schemer
who
should
have
been
jailed
long
ago
but
who
had
repeatedly
found
loopholes
that
served
as
ratholes
for
him
to
slip
through
and
remain
free
leaving
the
table
the
lone
ranger
began
a
quick
but
systematic
search
of
the
building
he
moved
down
the
aisle
studying
the
possessions
near
each
bunk
he
found
a
handbill
that
had
rangoon
picture
on
it
but
the
name
at
the
time
of
its
printing
was
abe
larkin
larkin
apparently
had
taken
any
pains
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
was
wanted
by
the
law
once
he
thought
he
heard
a
faint
low
moan
from
somewhere
close
at
hand
he
stood
attentive
but
the
sound
was
not
repeated
he
continued
in
his
search
oppressed
by
a
somewhat
guilty
feeling
as
a
prowler
and
an
unexplainable
sensation
that
there
was
someone
else
in
the
bunkhouse
with
him
he
studied
two
more
bunks
and
then
heard
the
moan
again
this
time
it
was
unmistakable
the
lone
ranger
hurried
to
the
far
end
of
the
bunkhouse
and
there
in
the
lower
bunk
on
his
right
he
found
a
man
unconscious
the
window
over
the
head
of
the
still
form
was
open
it
was
outside
this
window
that
the
unknown
rider
had
been
first
seen
the
unconscious
man
the
lone
ranger
could
see
in
the
dim
light
that
he
was
old
was
shadowed
by
the
bunk
of
the
second
tier
the
lone
ranger
unhooked
a
lamp
that
swung
from
the
ceiling
and
placed
it
so
that
the
light
fell
across
the
bald
head
which
lay
in
a
widening
pool
of
red
he
jerked
his
bandanna
from
a
pocket
and
soused
it
in
a
water
pitcher
then
he
bathed
the
old
fellow
face
a
tremulous
soft
sob
broke
through
the
white
mustache
the
eyes
of
the
wounded
man
fluttered
slightly
then
stared
up
there
was
an
empty
socket
where
the
left
eye
should
have
been
but
the
other
eye
was
bright
with
pain
take
it
easy
the
lone
ranger
whispered
i
going
to
have
a
look
at
that
wound
and
see
what
we
can
do
for
you
do
try
to
speak
just
yet
wait
a
little
he
turned
the
old
man
gently
to
his
side
and
saw
the
handle
of
a
knife
protruding
from
high
up
on
one
shoulder
the
blade
was
out
of
sight
he
did
touch
the
knife
there
was
no
use
the
wound
was
fatal
gimlet
at
best
had
only
a
few
minutes
he
applied
more
water
to
the
old
man
face
and
forehead
tell
me
if
you
can
who
did
this
he
said
gimlet
lips
moved
feebly
but
no
words
came
do
you
know
who
stabbed
you
asked
the
lone
ranger
one
word
just
the
name
of
the
man
can
you
tell
me
that
gimlet
lifted
one
hand
very
feebly
and
pointed
toward
the
open
window
the
lone
ranger
nodded
i
know
he
stabbed
you
through
that
window
tell
me
who
it
was
the
dying
man
seemed
to
be
gathering
himself
for
one
supreme
effort
he
swallowed
hard
his
eyelids
closed
then
opened
tried
he
said
then
coughed
and
started
again
i
i
tried
tuh
get
yuma
his
bunk
here
more
coughing
choked
the
words
blood
drooled
from
the
side
of
the
old
man
mouth
and
stained
his
white
mustache
the
lone
ranger
pressed
water
from
his
handkerchief
against
gimlet
lips
i
heard
you
he
said
softly
i
heard
what
you
said
you
tried
to
get
yuma
yuma
is
a
man
who
works
here
gimlet
nodded
you
said
this
was
his
bunk
again
the
slowly
moving
head
went
down
and
up
tell
me
some
more
what
about
yuma
felt
o
his
bunk
lookin
tuh
see
gimlet
had
to
pause
for
a
fit
of
coughing
so
violent
that
it
hardly
seemed
his
strength
could
stand
it
when
he
finished
his
breath
came
in
short
and
painful
gasps
the
the
house
he
managed
to
say
he
struggled
hard
fighting
the
grim
specter
every
step
of
its
advancing
way
there
was
more
he
wanted
desperately
to
tell
the
old
man
was
upon
that
borderline
between
the
living
and
the
dead
from
his
position
he
seemed
to
see
things
in
their
true
light
he
looked
beyond
the
mask
and
saw
a
man
he
knew
could
be
trusted
his
gnarled
hand
clutched
that
of
the
lone
ranger
while
he
fought
hard
to
make
a
last
statement
the
masked
man
leaned
close
to
him
to
catch
the
dying
words
if
they
were
uttered
but
whatever
gimlet
was
about
to
say
went
with
him
across
the
last
threshold
his
hand
clutched
convulsively
and
then
relaxed
he
coughed
once
and
brought
a
flood
of
his
life
blood
to
his
mouth
and
then
lay
back
the
masked
man
felt
and
found
no
pulse
he
closed
the
old
man
fingers
and
laid
them
across
the
bony
chest
yuma
he
muttered
this
was
yuma
bunk
i
wonder
who
yuma
is
and
where
i
find
him
his
thoughts
came
to
a
lurching
halt
when
a
sharp
voice
snarled
a
curse
with
cataclysmic
violence
yuh
damned
murderin
skunk
i
kill
yuh
fer
this
it
was
yuma
who
shouted
from
the
doorway
chapter
xvii
penelope
signs
her
name
yuma
swept
the
poker
table
aside
and
sent
it
clattering
and
crashing
against
the
wall
the
lone
ranger
had
no
chance
to
deny
the
accusation
the
man
from
arizona
hurled
anything
he
said
would
have
fallen
on
unhearing
ears
yuma
ignored
his
guns
and
lowering
his
head
charged
like
an
infuriated
bull
sweeping
down
the
aisle
between
the
bunks
and
gathering
power
and
speed
as
he
advanced
the
masked
man
had
no
chance
to
dodge
no
place
to
dodge
to
he
was
trapped
between
the
bunks
on
each
side
of
the
narrow
space
down
which
the
cowboy
rushed
his
gun
he
dropped
it
back
in
leather
nothing
but
a
death
slug
would
stop
yuma
he
was
blind
to
any
threat
of
shooting
then
yuma
struck
with
the
force
of
a
battering
ram
the
lone
ranger
staggered
back
from
the
terrific
impact
of
the
heavy
shoulder
flush
against
his
chest
intense
pain
stabbed
his
own
bandaged
shoulder
and
brilliant
lights
seemed
to
dance
before
his
eyes
he
barely
saw
the
huge
balled
fist
that
yuma
swung
to
follow
up
his
charge
almost
without
thought
the
lone
ranger
turned
his
head
quickly
to
roll
it
with
the
punch
and
take
a
glancing
blow
instead
of
one
that
might
have
smashed
his
jaw
he
fell
back
several
paces
fighting
to
stay
on
his
feet
until
his
reeling
senses
could
function
coherently
yuma
face
was
livid
he
swung
again
bringing
his
left
up
almost
from
the
floor
but
this
time
the
masked
man
dodged
the
blow
then
set
himself
for
defense
he
could
barely
move
his
left
arm
he
thought
the
wound
must
have
been
reopened
by
the
awful
onslaught
yuma
was
reaching
out
with
both
hands
trying
to
wrap
his
heavy
arms
around
the
lithe
lone
ranger
and
crush
him
to
the
floor
the
space
was
far
too
limited
for
such
maneuvering
so
the
masked
man
let
his
knees
collapse
and
dropped
like
a
plummet
while
the
adversary
clutched
at
empty
air
then
the
lone
ranger
shot
up
from
his
crouch
as
if
his
legs
were
coiled
steel
springs
he
brought
his
right
fist
up
with
the
full
whipcorded
strength
of
his
good
arm
augmented
by
the
muscles
of
the
legs
his
aim
was
perfect
and
his
timing
likewise
he
felt
his
hard
fist
crash
against
the
point
of
yuma
chin
and
saw
the
cowboy
head
snap
back
pain
and
fury
made
yuma
careless
and
too
eager
while
still
off
balance
from
the
blow
that
hurt
he
tried
to
swing
a
roundhouse
left
the
lone
ranger
stepped
inside
the
arc
of
that
tremendous
swing
and
jabbed
another
right
to
yuma
nose
then
chopped
a
hard
blow
to
the
unprotected
jaw
yuma
it
appeared
could
take
terrific
punishment
those
blows
of
the
lone
ranger
were
short
but
they
were
hard
strong
men
had
often
dropped
before
those
jabs
but
yuma
kept
on
fighting
his
fists
swung
wildly
while
he
kept
up
a
continual
string
of
cursing
threats
the
lone
ranger
strength
was
nearly
gone
he
admired
the
ability
of
yuma
to
stand
up
beneath
his
rain
of
rights
he
dared
not
use
his
left
and
tear
that
shoulder
wound
still
further
how
long
he
wondered
in
the
name
of
mercy
how
long
can
he
keep
this
up
he
knew
that
any
one
of
the
wild
blows
if
it
landed
true
would
knock
him
out
then
his
campaign
would
end
before
it
got
well
started
again
and
still
again
he
drove
his
right
fist
flush
against
the
big
man
face
blood
streamed
from
yuma
nose
and
a
cut
was
opened
over
his
right
eye
he
gave
ground
now
backing
toward
the
door
of
the
bunkhouse
while
the
lone
ranger
advanced
how
long
it
might
have
gone
on
is
hard
to
say
but
yuma
backed
against
the
upturned
table
lost
his
balance
and
went
over
backward
his
head
smacked
hard
against
the
floor
for
an
instant
yuma
tried
to
rise
though
totally
unconscious
his
stout
fighter
heart
fighting
on
then
his
eyes
rolled
up
and
he
went
limp
breathing
hard
almost
gasping
the
lone
ranger
crouched
beside
his
fallen
enemy
he
found
that
yuma
though
bumped
hard
was
probably
not
seriously
injured
he
opened
the
door
and
sucked
deep
satisfying
drinks
of
the
cool
night
air
until
his
breathing
was
more
nearly
normal
and
his
throbbing
head
stopped
spinning
then
he
turned
once
more
to
the
unconscious
man
what
a
fighter
he
thought
admiringly
what
a
man
but
he
must
not
linger
here
too
long
there
was
still
the
business
at
the
ranch
house
he
saw
a
horse
standing
just
outside
the
bunkhouse
there
was
a
blanket
roll
strapped
behind
the
saddle
and
saddlebags
that
bulged
he
glanced
toward
the
ranch
house
but
saw
no
sign
that
anyone
had
heard
the
fight
even
if
this
is
that
man
horse
he
decided
it
will
have
to
do
for
the
time
being
he
dragged
the
heavy
form
of
the
unconscious
man
to
the
side
of
the
horse
and
then
sparing
his
throbbing
left
arm
as
much
as
possible
hoisted
yuma
across
the
saddle
in
a
highly
uncomfortable
position
yuma
head
shoulders
and
arms
drooped
on
one
side
as
the
belly
rested
on
the
saddle
and
his
legs
balanced
him
on
the
other
side
the
masked
man
used
yuma
own
rope
to
tie
him
securely
in
place
the
man
was
going
to
prove
something
of
a
problem
but
the
lone
ranger
wanted
to
keep
him
to
question
him
at
length
when
he
recovered
consciousness
already
the
masked
man
had
been
widely
in
his
plan
to
call
on
bryant
and
penny
for
a
conference
but
one
of
the
qualities
that
contributed
to
his
later
greatness
was
his
ability
to
revise
his
plans
continually
to
suit
changing
conditions
or
to
reject
plans
altogether
and
replace
them
by
new
ones
he
wanted
silver
near
him
now
but
the
stallion
was
far
across
the
level
stretch
concealed
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
if
anyone
had
been
near
enough
to
hear
he
thought
the
sound
of
that
fight
would
certainly
have
brought
them
i
take
a
chance
he
whistled
sharply
and
heard
a
responsive
whinny
come
back
to
him
from
the
darkness
he
stood
tense
and
guarded
waiting
for
anything
his
whistle
might
have
brought
but
no
one
came
pounding
hoofs
however
announced
the
approach
of
silver
as
the
stallion
beat
across
the
grass
still
no
sign
of
any
other
presence
the
lone
ranger
did
know
then
that
the
solid
timber
walls
of
the
big
rambling
house
where
penny
and
her
cousins
were
faced
by
sawtell
and
his
men
were
practically
soundproof
the
quality
that
made
it
impossible
for
the
masked
man
whistle
or
the
noise
of
the
fight
to
be
heard
inside
the
house
likewise
muffled
the
sounds
in
the
house
so
that
the
masked
man
did
hear
the
pleas
and
cries
of
vince
and
jeb
cavendish
leading
yuma
horse
with
its
unconscious
burden
the
lone
ranger
moved
away
from
the
lighted
bunkhouse
and
met
silver
in
the
darkness
he
fumbled
in
a
pocket
for
a
pencil
then
scribbled
a
hurried
message
on
paper
from
a
saddlebag
and
tied
it
to
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
he
knew
that
some
hard
rider
had
already
gone
up
the
thunder
mountain
trail
if
it
were
in
the
cards
for
someone
to
find
talk
with
and
perhaps
release
rangoon
this
would
have
already
transpired
and
tonto
mission
would
be
finished
now
he
said
softly
to
silver
go
find
tonto
he
slapped
the
white
horse
firmly
repeating
the
name
tonto
silver
tossed
his
head
and
rushed
away
the
masked
man
made
another
quick
examination
of
his
prisoner
he
found
him
still
unconscious
but
the
pulse
was
steady
and
the
breathing
normal
assured
that
nothing
was
seriously
wrong
he
led
the
loaded
horse
to
the
ranch
house
walked
to
one
side
of
the
building
and
tossed
the
reins
about
a
post
then
on
soundless
feet
he
stepped
upon
the
porch
he
felt
in
his
pocket
and
found
the
silver
bullet
penelope
had
refused
it
served
to
remind
him
that
he
owed
the
girl
a
debt
that
would
be
hard
to
repay
he
must
he
decided
catch
bryant
by
surprise
before
the
old
man
could
shout
for
help
must
speak
quickly
reassure
the
man
and
make
him
listen
to
the
purpose
of
the
call
he
opened
the
outer
door
without
a
sound
and
then
heard
penny
voice
the
girl
sat
between
lonergan
and
lombard
at
a
round
table
near
the
fireplace
sawtell
was
in
another
chair
a
little
distant
keeping
one
eye
on
a
poker
in
the
coals
the
other
on
two
bound
men
on
the
floor
vince
was
whimpering
like
a
beaten
cur
while
penny
looked
at
him
with
disgust
evident
in
her
face
i
wo
never
ferget
this
cousin
penny
honest
tuh
god
i
wo
said

as
sure
as
hell

in
red
oak
hurry
up
an
sign
it
lonergan
dipped
a
pen
in
a
bottle
of
ink
and
held
it
toward
the
girl
here
you
are
he
said
suavely
as
he
pointed
to
a
line
at
the
bottom
of
a
long
page
of
close
writing
sign
right
there
beneath
the
others
and
then
we
sign
as
witnesses
penelope
took
the
pen
and
tapped
the
end
meditatively
against
her
small
even
teeth
just
let
me
get
everything
straight
she
said
in
the
first
place
if
uncle
bryant
does
want
to
leave
his
property
to
us
he
does
need
to
he
can
make
a
will
ca
he
lonergan
nodded
and
glanced
at
sawtell
tell
her
the
man
suggested
lonergan
went
into
a
lengthy
discourse
on
the
legality
of
wills
that
left
estates
to
others
than
the
blood
relations
and
told
how
there
had
been
times
in
courts
of
law
when
those
wills
had
been
contested
bryant
one
desire
he
went
on
is
to
leave
his
outfit
to
someone
and
have
no
question
about
the
will
being
valid
he
wants
all
four
nephews
and
you
to
sign
to
the
effect
that
you
relinquish
all
claims
whatsoever
to
the
basin
property
for
a
consideration
not
described
lonergan
did
make
it
as
simple
as
he
might
have
done
he
seemed
to
gloat
in
the
opportunity
to
air
his
knowledge
of
legal
phrases
and
quote
from
his
experiences
as
a
lawyer
in
the
east
does
it
asked
penny
make
some
difference
when
the
signature
is
secured
by
threat
of
torture
lonergan
smiled
of
course
if
i
do
sign
you
use
that
iron
on
vince
and
jeb
that
would
be
hard
to
prove
suggested
lonergan
sawtell
broke
in
impatiently
hurry
up
and
sign
we
ca
wait
all
night
one
thing
more
said
penny
what
about
wallie
and
mort
bryant
get
their
names
signed
when
we
take
that
paper
to
town
penny
still
hesitated
she
knew
everything
was
there
were
lies
and
liars
on
every
side
no
one
could
be
trusted
she
wondered
why
all
the
cries
had
brought
old
gimlet
from
the
kitchen
she
almost
wished
that
she
had
left
when
yuma
wanted
her
to
go
with
him
look
said
penny
suddenly
i
been
listening
to
what
you
said
now
suppose
you
listen
to
me
for
just
a
minute
i
going
to
sign
this
paper
simply
because
it
wo
make
a
particle
of
difference
to
me
if
anything
happened
to
uncle
bryant
i
want
no
part
of
this
ranch
as
long
as
the
place
is
infested
with
vermin
lonergan
showed
resentment
at
this
statement
and
leaned
forward
to
speak
but
a
glance
at
sawtell
changed
his
mind
the
killer
held
up
a
silencing
hand
lonergan
relaxed
penelope
looked
at
vince
you
she
said
hotly
turn
my
stomach
i
know
very
well
that
you
and
mort
have
been
scheming
all
along
you
helped
rangoon
kill
those
texas
rangers
you
as
much
to
blame
for
becky
murder
as
mort
you
told
him
he
had
to
shut
her
up
vince
looked
at
his
cousin
as
she
went
on
you
nothing
but
a
little
squirt
without
spunk
enough
to
even
like
a
man
let
alone
like
one
you
been
whimpering
like
a
whipped
cur
trying
to
arouse
a
lot
of
sympathy
with
your
crocodile
tears
well
i
knew
all
along
that
you
were
faking
now
do
you
feel
like
a
jackass
as
penelope
warmed
to
the
subject
all
the
bitterness
of
the
past
weeks
found
outlet
in
her
lashing
words
maybe
this
is
uncle
bryant
desire
if
so
it
all
right
with
me
but
i
going
to
find
out
what
possessed
him
to
turn
on
me
if
it
his
idea
find
that
out
she
turned
toward
jeb
as
for
you
i
sorry
for
you
you
a
worthless
dreamer
you
might
have
been
an
artist
or
a
writer
or
a
poet
if
you
had
been
too
lazy
to
get
some
education
as
it
is
you
not
worth
a
plugged
dime
to
anyone
least
of
all
to
these
crooks
as
soon
as
they
satisfied
that
you
ca
help
them
they
kill
you
jeb
squirmed
uneasily
in
his
ropes
you
men
both
of
you
and
so
are
your
brothers
the
girl
jabbed
the
pen
into
the
ink
and
rapidly
signed
her
name
to
the
paper
you
can
have
your
paper
all
signed
as
you
want
it
she
said
almost
trembling
with
the
white
heat
of
her
rage
take
it
to
bryant
if
what
you
going
to
do
and
tell
him
that
as
long
as
those
kids
are
upstairs
without
anyone
to
take
care
of
them
a
ca
drag
me
from
here
and
as
soon
as
wallie
brings
that
woman
he
promised
to
there
is
any
power
on
earth
can
me
here
she
thrust
the
paper
signed
toward
sawtell
here
you
are
and
have
fun
while
you
can
because
pretty
soon
someone
is
going
to
ask
a
lot
of
questions
about
six
murdered
texas
rangers
i
take
that
a
new
voice
said
all
eyes
turned
toward
the
door
a
tall
man
with
lean
hips
and
broad
shoulders
stood
there
a
man
whose
hat
was
white
whose
face
was
masked
who
the
hell
are
you
barked
lonergan
the
masked
man
stepped
forward
reaching
for
the
paper
i
be
damned
before
you
started
lombard
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
a
gun
appeared
as
if
by
magic
in
the
tall
masked
man
right
hand
lombard
fell
back
before
the
weapon
threat
who
is
he
whar
he
come
from
how
he
git
here
there
was
a
chorus
of
amazed
exclamations
there
were
threats
yuh
wo
git
away
with
this
yuh
better
drop
them
guns
afore
we
git
mad
you
wo
leave
this
basin
alive
but
no
one
made
a
move
of
aggression
the
lone
ranger
glanced
quickly
at
the
document
folded
it
and
tucked
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
shirt
while
his
gun
remained
steady
covering
the
room
at
large
i
gathered
from
what
i
heard
that
bryant
cavendish
has
gone
to
red
oak
he
said
if
this
paper
is
for
him
none
of
you
need
worry
because
i
take
it
to
him
the
expression
on
penelope
flushed
face
was
a
mixture
of
admiration
and
resentment
she
stared
at
the
intruder
liking
him
instinctively
in
spite
of
herself
she
could
understand
his
part
in
the
grim
drama
that
seemed
to
be
unfolding
on
a
circular
stage
while
she
stood
in
the
center
chapter
xviii
a
gambler
talks
the
masked
man
studied
vince
and
then
the
others
in
turn
he
could
feel
the
electric
tension
in
the
room
the
killers
were
motionless
and
silent
returning
his
gaze
with
crafty
eyes
watching
for
the
slightest
relaxation
that
would
give
them
the
split
second
required
to
drop
a
hand
and
fire
from
the
hip
the
lone
ranger
knew
this
type
and
underestimate
them
they
were
expert
gunmen
who
would
kill
without
compunction
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
low
but
every
word
was
sharp
and
distinct
it
something
of
a
surprise
to
learn
that
three
men
who
are
wanted
so
badly
by
the
law
have
stayed
close
by
you
might
have
done
better
to
have
gotten
out
of
texas
none
of
the
men
replied
penelope
watched
the
masked
man
as
if
hypnotized
twice
now
he
had
arrived
at
a
crisis
in
spite
of
herself
she
found
that
she
was
trusting
him
of
course
you
felt
secure
here
the
lone
ranger
went
on
you
knew
that
thunder
mountain
would
make
a
fine
hideout
in
case
any
law
men
managed
to
get
through
the
gap
you
cleared
out
a
trail
and
a
campsite
and
then
concealed
it
you
felt
pretty
safe
or
you
would
have
stayed
here
wo
yuh
cut
us
loose
pleaded
vince
where
are
the
rest
of
the
men
who
work
here
asked
the
masked
man
they
went
tuh
town
said
vince
right
after
the
buryin
they
made
a
sort
o
holiday
of
it
they
be
comin
back
the
masked
man
turned
slightly
toward
penny
still
however
watching
the
others
he
would
ask
later
about
the
burial
how
many
of
those
other
men
are
wanted
by
the
law
i
do
know
i
do
know
but
the
whole
pack
of
them
are
crooked
they
must
be
if
they
were
they
get
out
like
yuma
did
yuma
he
tried
to
persuade
me
to
leave
here
i
wish
to
heaven
i
could
have
i
thought
i
could
depend
on
uncle
bryant
but
now
penny
broke
off
in
doubt
the
lone
ranger
realizing
that
the
girl
could
add
a
great
deal
to
his
understanding
of
events
pressed
her
for
more
details
there
time
to
talk
later
she
said
talk
now
tell
me
more
about
this
man
yuma
penny
explained
how
she
had
trusted
her
uncle
in
spite
of
all
that
had
been
said
how
she
had
tried
to
account
for
his
unconcern
in
the
face
of
events
by
thinking
that
his
eyes
must
be
failing
yuma
she
explained
had
tried
to
tell
her
that
she
was
mistaken
in
her
trust
yuma
had
been
fired
at
by
bryant
had
fought
with
him
and
finally
had
left
the
basin
she
explained
that
it
was
bryant
belief
in
mort
thin
alibi
for
murdering
rebecca
that
had
finally
showed
her
her
mistake
and
now
the
clincher
was
the
paper
bryant
had
left
for
her
to
sign
the
lone
ranger
broke
in
from
time
to
time
with
questions
that
brought
out
the
story
of
rebecca
and
the
children
upstairs
penny
told
him
that
she
felt
compelled
to
remain
for
the
sake
of
the
children
until
wallie
returned
gimlet
she
said
was
too
old
to
take
the
responsibility
so
you
believe
in
yuma
penny
nodded
her
eyes
bright
with
unshed
tears
i
i
must
the
last
time
we
met
the
masked
man
said
i
offered
you
something
that
you
refused
i
going
to
offer
it
again
and
what
i
said
then
still
goes
he
reached
one
hand
into
a
pocket
then
dropped
a
silver
bullet
on
the
table
the
men
looked
at
it
curiously
penny
glanced
at
it
then
at
the
steady
level
eyes
behind
the
mask
for
a
time
she
said
nothing
then
it
means
a
lot
to
you
to
find
out
who
killed
those
texas
rangers
does
it
the
lone
ranger
nodded
please
he
said
pick
up
that
bullet
you
might
need
it
remember
what
i
told
you
to
do
with
it
you
mentioned
an
old
man
named
gimlet
yes
gimlet
is
dead
the
announcement
was
an
obvious
surprise
to
everyone
and
to
penny
it
was
much
more
it
was
a
severe
shock
he
was
stabbed
the
masked
man
explained
i
was
with
him
when
he
died
in
the
bunkhouse
but
what
was
he
doing
there
he
slept
in
the
house
here
i
do
know
why
he
went
to
the
bunkhouse
but
that
where
i
found
him
he
gave
me
the
name
of
the
man
the
lone
ranger
spoke
slowly
he
named
a
fellow
you
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago
he
said
i
do
believe
it
declared
penny
hotly
yuma
was
gimlet
friend
yuma
was
my
friend
too
he
tried
to
reason
with
uncle
bryant
and
when
he
could
he
left
here
oh
no
no
no
yuma
would
murder
anyone
least
of
all
old
gimlet
penny
picked
up
the
silver
bullet
and
clutched
it
in
her
tiny
fist
there
must
be
a
mistake
she
sobbed
if
yuma
did
kill
him
said
the
lone
ranger
we
soon
know
who
did
in
the
meantime
i
take
this
paper
to
bryant
to
see
what
he
has
to
say
about
it
lonergan
the
spoke
mind
he
drawled
in
a
cocksure
manner
if
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
well
it
strikes
me
stranger
that
you
in
a
hell
of
a
spot
right
now
and
you
do
know
just
what
to
do
about
it
you
like
the
gent
that
had
a
wildcat
by
the
tail
and
did
dare
let
go
go
on
snapped
the
masked
man
lonergan
lean
fingers
resting
on
the
table
beat
a
soft
rhythm
he
spoke
with
an
assurance
that
was
annoying
to
say
the
least
you
ravaged
the
privacy
of
this
ranch
and
illegally
entered
a
private
home
without
permission
you
flaunted
that
gun
in
our
faces
and
asked
a
lot
of
questions
you
stolen
a
legal
form
that
yours
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
in
fact
it
none
of
your
damned
business
what
goes
on
here
any
more
to
say
lonergan
plenty
you
ca
stay
here
from
now
on
you
do
know
when
the
rest
of
the
men
will
come
back
and
make
it
hot
for
you
you
ca
prove
any
of
the
charges
you
made
or
hinted
at
or
anything
that
the
girl
has
said
besides
i
do
expect
the
law
would
listen
to
you
while
wearin
that
mask
you
like
to
turn
us
all
over
to
the
law
and
collect
some
rewards
but
that
be
downright
hard
to
handle
because
quite
a
few
of
us
here
and
you
have
to
take
us
through
the
gap
and
run
the
risk
of
meeting
our
friends
you
ca
very
well
take
the
girl
and
the
four
youngsters
away
with
you
for
the
same
reason
you
leave
here
alone
and
we
simply
make
out
another
form
like
the
one
you
stuck
in
your
pocket
and
have
the
signatures
made
all
over
again
when
you
leave
there
a
damn
good
chance
that
one
of
us
will
drill
you
penny
thought
she
saw
uneasiness
in
the
masked
man
she
glanced
from
him
to
lonergan
while
she
too
wondered
what
could
be
done
she
wanted
nothing
less
than
to
be
left
there
with
those
killers
especially
after
what
she
had
heard
about
gimlet
and
yuma
now
there
would
be
no
one
to
witness
whatever
might
transpire
have
you
asked
the
masked
man
any
propositions
penny
saw
the
wink
that
lonergan
showed
sawtell
she
wondered
if
the
masked
man
saw
it
too
maybe
so
the
gambler
said
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
things
here
now
just
forget
what
you
know
take
off
that
mask
and
let
us
see
who
you
are
and
then
either
join
up
with
us
or
ride
away
and
keep
your
mouth
shut
the
tall
stranger
seemed
to
be
considering
penny
wanted
to
scream
out
a
warning
that
he
would
never
be
allowed
to
leave
the
place
alive
he
would
be
killed
no
matter
what
his
decision
might
be
lonergan
went
on
you
must
have
brains
enough
to
realize
that
you
would
be
able
to
prove
that
any
of
us
had
a
hand
in
murdering
those
texas
rangers
why
we
could
even
prove
we
do
it
by
the
footprints
of
an
indian
around
the
place
where
they
been
buried
so
the
graves
had
been
found
the
masked
man
added
this
minute
detail
to
his
knowledge
anyone
can
see
went
on
lonergan
that
they
must
have
been
ambushed
by
indians
maybe
old
gimlet
who
took
a
message
in
to
town
for
captain
blythe
had
a
hand
in
framing
them
for
murder
gimlet
might
have
had
an
old
grudge
he
wanted
to
settle
with
texas
rangers
he
been
around
here
for
a
good
many
years
you
know
i
admit
the
masked
man
said
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
prove
who
killed
those
men
but
is
a
different
matter
furthermore
the
law
wants
you
men
for
other
things
as
for
lonergan
argued
the
law
have
to
find
us
first
as
for
the
when
we
sell
cattle
the
brands
are
we
have
sold
a
head
that
has
had
the
cavendish
brand
penny
felt
the
world
fall
still
further
apart
when
the
man
she
had
begun
to
trust
said
what
if
i
join
up
with
you
lombard
and
sawtell
looked
admiringly
at
lonergan
and
more
than
ever
appreciated
his
glib
tongue
in
that
case
you
split
the
proceeds
like
the
rest
of
us
but
what
about
the
stolen
cattle
lonergan
shook
his
head
never
can
be
traced
here
he
said
we
bring
them
down
the
mountain
trail
from
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
we
shove
them
in
with
older
cows
and
run
a
new
brand
we
got
a
dozen
brands
recorded
to
work
with
we
keep
the
cattle
here
until
the
scar
has
healed
to
look
old
meanwhile
we
take
cattle
from
the
last
batch
up
the
trail
and
sell
them
we
have
no
trouble
at
all
penelope
could
see
lonergan
purpose
he
was
a
gambler
and
playing
at
his
game
he
told
everything
that
would
occupy
time
knowing
that
at
any
minute
some
of
the
men
would
be
returning
from
red
oak
he
was
betting
that
the
masked
man
could
never
use
that
information
she
saw
the
tall
stranger
apparently
considering
the
offer
to
join
the
gang
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
could
this
masked
man
realize
what
lonergan
was
doing
why
did
he
come
here
with
some
concrete
plan
instead
of
bungling
in
to
find
himself
so
helpless
even
though
he
held
a
gun
on
the
others
you
have
a
pretty
machine
for
stealing
cattle
the
lone
ranger
said
in
admiration
and
as
you
say
it
would
be
almost
impossible
for
me
to
do
much
in
fighting
against
you
that
right
agreed
lonergan
now
put
up
that
gun
and
take
off
the
mask
an
we
talk
but
first
tell
me
who
i
taking
orders
from
sawtell
the
masked
man
shook
his
head
there
someone
giving
him
orders
who
is
that
a
crafty
look
came
into
lonergan
cadaverous
face
you
mentioned
his
name
a
while
ago
he
glanced
at
penny
and
said
yuma
hoofs
clattered
close
outside
the
house
penny
felt
that
now
there
surely
would
be
a
climax
of
events
and
she
was
right
the
masked
manner
changed
abruptly
he
listened
for
a
moment
as
the
hoofbeats
stopped
a
trace
of
a
smile
showed
on
his
lips
his
uncertainty
gave
way
to
grim
and
vigorous
speech
you
wondered
and
asked
he
snapped
what
i
was
going
to
do
here
now
you
find
out
something
about
the
transformation
in
the
masked
man
made
penny
want
to
shout
she
felt
that
her
trust
in
him
had
not
been
misplaced
after
all
the
lone
ranger
shoved
the
table
back
then
kicked
a
hooked
rug
away
from
its
place
on
the
plank
floor
this
house
has
stood
here
a
good
many
years
he
said
before
bryant
came
here
it
was
used
as
a
hiding
place
for
army
supplies
when
the
indians
were
bad
i
been
told
by
a
lot
of
old
timers
that
there
a
vault
beneath
this
floor
penny
knew
about
the
vault
the
trap
door
in
the
floor
that
led
to
it
had
been
hidden
by
the
carpet
but
now
it
was
exposed
that
vault
continued
the
masked
man
was
also
used
to
hold
prisoners
when
it
was
convenient
to
move
them
well
it
going
to
be
used
to
hold
prisoners
again
watching
the
men
still
holding
his
gun
on
them
he
threw
back
the
trap
door
with
a
bang
lonergan
poker
face
was
changed
baffled
fury
showed
in
his
black
snapping
eyes
lombard
swore
and
sawtell
squinted
grimly
while
his
lips
compressed
to
a
thin
line
get
down
there
commanded
the
masked
man
all
of
you
lonergan
went
first
very
slowly
dragging
his
steps
until
the
masked
man
prodded
him
hard
with
his
gun
after
disarming
him
you
two
can
take
those
men
you
tied
up
the
lone
ranger
told
sawtell
and
lombard
as
he
drew
their
guns
from
the
holsters
and
tossed
them
aside
despite
their
pleas
vince
and
jeb
were
hauled
down
the
steep
and
rotting
ladder
to
the
damp
windowless
vault
walled
in
by
stone
beneath
the
floor
at
least
untie
us
cried
vince
your
pals
can
do
that
it
unholy
cried
jeb
yuh
ca
put
me
with
them
killers
this
ai
the
will
o
the
lord
fer
me
tuh
suffer
sech
company
at
least
yelled
lombard
from
the
depths
give
us
a
light
down
here
the
lone
ranger
dropped
the
door
in
place
and
bolted
it
it
be
hard
for
them
to
open
it
from
down
below
he
told
penelope
but
just
to
make
sure
they
stay
there
for
the
time
being
we
brace
it
he
moved
the
heavy
table
over
the
trap
door
and
on
this
piled
a
chair
lengths
of
firewood
were
stacked
near
the
fireplace
and
one
of
these
reached
from
the
chair
to
the
rafter
of
the
room
if
they
want
to
push
their
way
out
of
that
commented
the
masked
man
they
have
to
push
the
roof
off
this
house
but
yuma
i
know
he
is
the
lone
ranger
gripped
the
trembling
hand
of
the
girl
firmly
please
do
jump
to
conclusions
he
admonished
her
we
not
going
to
take
a
thing
for
granted
but
everything
else
they
said
was
true
that
be
what
been
doing
to
steal
the
cattle
the
stock
here
have
increased
in
numbers
a
great
deal
lonergan
told
the
truth
about
everything
else
we
see
and
that
horse
that
came
up
someone
has
returned
from
red
oak
the
masked
man
shook
his
head
no
one
has
come
from
red
oak
yet
that
horse
you
heard
was
silver
i
sent
him
after
my
friend
me
come
penny
turned
sharply
and
saw
tonto
standing
in
the
doorway
the
indian
looked
troubled
you
come
quick
he
told
the
lone
ranger
there
plenty
trouble
tonto
tell
you
the
man
in
the
mask
nodded
quickly
remember
that
bullet
he
told
penny
do
worry
and
take
good
care
of
those
kids
upstairs
you
have
plenty
of
loaded
weapons
here
if
those
men
below
make
trouble
shoot
a
warning
through
the
floor
the
lone
ranger
left
the
room
and
went
outside
with
tonto
chapter
xix
announcement
extraordinary
tonto
was
visibly
agitated
by
something
that
had
happened
while
he
lay
hidden
in
the
darkness
near
the
clearing
the
lone
ranger
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
penelope
on
guard
in
the
house
then
closed
the
door
plenty
happen
said
tonto
the
lone
ranger
interrupted
just
a
minute
he
looked
toward
the
bunkhouse
still
brilliantly
lighted
and
then
at
his
prisoner
yuma
was
regaining
consciousness
and
squirming
about
uneasily
in
his
uncomfortable
position
could
you
hear
what
was
said
inside
tonto
the
indian
nodded
and
once
more
started
to
speak
before
you
tell
me
what
happened
in
the
clearing
let
me
tell
you
about
a
murder
down
here
the
lone
ranger
hurriedly
sketched
the
recent
grim
events
making
no
effort
to
soften
his
voice
so
that
his
prisoner
could
hear
he
mention
the
document
taken
from
penny
but
he
did
tell
about
locking
the
killers
in
the
cellar
now
he
finished
tell
me
did
that
man
who
passed
me
find
rangoon
tonto
said
that
right
him
come
to
clearing
rangoon
call
him
stop
the
lone
ranger
noticed
that
yuma
had
stopped
squirming
he
seemed
to
be
listening
intently
to
what
the
indian
said
tonto
explained
how
the
unknown
rider
had
dismounted
and
had
talked
for
a
few
moments
in
an
undertone
to
rangoon
their
voices
were
too
soft
for
the
indian
to
get
the
gist
of
the
conversation
and
he
dared
not
move
closer
for
fear
of
detection
the
unknown
rider
had
then
untethered
rangoon
horse
a
moment
later
a
shot
was
fired
and
hoofbeats
signified
the
fast
departure
of
both
horses
one
ridden
by
the
killer
the
other
led
it
had
been
too
dark
for
tonto
to
distinguish
anything
he
did
even
know
which
man
had
been
shot
until
he
struck
matches
and
identified
rangoon
when
tonto
finished
his
narration
yuma
broke
in
impatiently
look
here
stranger
how
long
figger
on
leavin
me
like
this
my
belly
fit
tuh
meet
my
spine
the
masked
man
with
tonto
help
untied
the
big
prisoner
and
slid
him
from
his
horse
you
all
right
he
asked
my
head
achin
fit
tuh
split
what
in
hell
did
yuh
hit
me
with
you
tripped
and
your
head
rapped
the
floor
oh
yuma
made
no
resistance
as
he
was
retied
his
hands
behind
his
back
he
obediently
climbed
into
his
saddle
when
ordered
to
do
so
who
he
asked
are
you
if
i
wanted
you
to
know
i
take
this
mask
off
would
i
know
yuh
then
i
doubt
it
i
do
remember
ever
having
seen
you
before
tonight
now
listen
to
me
i
letting
you
sit
in
the
saddle
so
that
you
be
more
comfortable
i
not
going
to
gag
you
unless
you
start
yelling
there
are
a
few
things
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
and
you
save
yourself
a
lot
of
trouble
if
you
answer
my
questions
while
he
spoke
the
lone
ranger
connected
yuma
feet
with
a
rope
tied
to
each
ankle
and
drawn
beneath
the
belly
of
his
horse
if
you
try
to
run
away
i
lasso
you
and
you
find
yourself
in
a
bad
way
because
you
ca
get
out
of
the
saddle
i
ai
no
damn
fool
retorted
yuma
in
a
sulky
voice
get
going
said
his
captor
yuma
heeled
his
horse
obediently
and
started
ahead
the
lone
ranger
rode
about
ten
feet
behind
next
to
tonto
whispering
softly
tonto
frowned
heavily
at
everything
that
was
said
and
tried
several
times
to
persuade
the
white
man
to
relax
for
at
least
an
hour
and
rest
the
day
and
night
thus
far
had
been
punishing
for
any
man
and
especially
so
for
one
who
had
still
a
great
deal
of
his
strength
and
endurance
to
regain
i
going
to
ride
into
red
oak
the
lone
ranger
told
tonto
and
that
a
good
two
hours
in
the
saddle
i
can
doze
on
the
way
silver
knows
the
trail
back
there
tonto
countered
with
a
comment
but
the
masked
man
explained
that
he
was
quite
used
to
spending
days
and
nights
on
end
in
the
saddle
sleeping
there
quite
easily
and
anyway
he
finished
i
think
we
right
on
the
verge
of
discovering
who
the
leader
of
those
outlaws
is
lonergan
said
it
was
the
same
man
that
gimlet
mentioned
but
i
do
think
so
tonto
at
door
then
name
that
what
lonergan
said
i
think
he
lied
who
you
think
leader
i
not
sure
yet
tonto
i
been
doing
a
little
thinking
while
been
riding
the
masked
man
slowed
silver
and
tonto
followed
suit
yuma
continued
on
at
the
same
gait
when
the
distance
had
widened
so
that
it
was
unlikely
that
conversation
would
be
heard
by
the
captured
man
the
lone
ranger
outlined
what
he
wanted
tonto
to
do
turn
back
he
whispered
in
a
voice
that
was
husky
with
fatigue
take
care
of
the
prisoner
i
leave
him
in
the
cave
and
then
ride
on
to
red
oak
he
spoke
rapidly
and
tonto
head
bobbed
comprehension
and
approval
of
the
the
man
who
rode
uphill
was
one
of
the
points
the
masked
man
emphasized
slimy
ground
on
the
mountain
different
from
that
of
the
gap
as
he
talked
the
lone
ranger
kept
an
eye
on
the
big
cowpuncher
he
had
captured
the
level
basin
ended
in
steep
walls
divided
by
bryant
gap
it
was
here
that
tonto
halted
lifted
his
right
hand
high
in
a
parting
gesture
and
wheeled
scout
about
the
lone
ranger
watched
his
friend
sweeping
across
the
basin
on
a
back
trail
toward
the
ranch
house
then
he
turned
and
in
the
light
of
an
ascending
moon
grown
he
saw
that
yuma
too
had
halted
and
was
waiting
in
the
gap
it
took
but
a
moment
for
the
lone
ranger
to
join
the
prisoner
and
then
the
two
rode
side
by
side
after
a
period
of
silence
yuma
spoke
ca
git
it
tuh
save
me
he
growled
what
that
yuma
looked
across
the
space
between
the
horses
what
in
hell
yore
part
in
things
around
here
why
first
yuh
ride
here
like
one
of
the
killers
i
figger
you
murdered
gimlet
yuh
knock
hell
outen
me
then
yuh
lock
them
skunks
in
the
cellar
the
lone
ranger
liked
the
outspoken
manner
of
the
man
i
reckon
from
what
i
heard
you
ai
the
gent
that
finished
gimlet
no
yer
huntin
the
leader
o
them
outlaws
ai
that
so
the
masked
man
said
stop
here
for
a
minute
yuma
reined
up
take
a
look
over
there
the
lone
ranger
said
yuma
saw
six
mounds
of
stone
and
earth
at
the
base
of
a
sheer
cliff
a
crude
cross
surmounted
each
of
those
piles
he
nodded
grimly
i
know
about
texas
rangers
ai
they
i
heard
about
the
shootin
then
a
couple
of
the
boys
said
someone
had
buried
someone
buried
them
repeated
the
lone
ranger
a
redskin
or
someone
wearin
moccasins
an
indian
the
masked
man
agreed
softly
after
a
thoughtful
pause
yuma
said
that
pard
of
yores
that
right
yuma
pondered
further
while
the
lone
ranger
waited
yuh
figger
i
got
somethin
more
tuh
say
have
you
reckon
so
i
have
as
i
size
it
up
yore
out
tuh
do
fer
the
ones
that
ambushed
those
men
that
said
the
other
is
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
whatever
else
may
happen
the
most
important
thing
to
me
is
to
avenge
the
men
who
fill
those
graves
you
was
especial
interested
in
shootin
up
some
of
the
skunks
that
done
it
reflected
yuma
with
regret
in
his
voice
they
can
be
picked
up
later
not
if
the
rest
of
the
pack
get
back
they
let
out
an
then
all
hell
is
goin
tuh
break
loose
till
you
an
that
injun
are
fillin
a
couple
more
graves
i
interested
in
the
leader
of
this
outfit
what
about
that
purty
girl
what
about
her
holy
smoke
exploded
yuma
ca
yuh
see
the
spot
the
poor
girl
in
or
maybe
yuh
do
savvy
she
got
four
cousins
an
not
one
of
has
the
guts
tuh
protect
her
every
skunk
in
the
basin
would
like
to
make
a
play
fer
miss
penny
an
it
ai
nothin
exceptin
bryant
cavendish
that
keeps
from
it
yuh
figger
bryant
the
leader
do
yuh
wal
maybe
so
he
is
but
i
a
damn
sight
sooner
he
kept
on
orderin
them
crooks
around
in
an
sellin
than
tuh
see
him
jailed
penelope
left
without
him
i
was
told
that
the
leader
was
a
man
called
i
heard
that
i
heard
what
you
told
the
redskin
gimlet
mentioned
the
same
name
just
before
he
died
but
that
a
blasted
yuma
broke
off
leaving
his
speech
suspended
we
push
ahead
now
the
lone
ranger
said
when
they
were
on
their
way
again
the
masked
man
noticed
that
his
prisoner
was
deep
in
thought
there
were
furrows
across
his
forehead
his
eyes
were
in
heavy
concentration
you
have
told
me
who
you
are
yet
the
lone
ranger
said
finally
tai
none
of
yer
business
was
the
reply
yuma
went
on
as
if
simply
voicing
the
thoughts
that
had
been
broken
by
the
speech
do
make
sense
at
all
he
muttered
bryant
would
let
penny
git
hurt
the
volume
of
his
speech
increased
a
bit
dammit
all
tuh
hell
an
gone
i
never
seen
a
man
like
you
i
bet
by
gosh
yuh
drill
bryant
if
yuh
thought
he
bossed
the
murderin
o
them
rangers
do
you
think
that
would
be
justified
yuh
would
jest
take
him
tuh
the
law
you
deal
with
him
personal
eh
that
would
all
depend
unless
i
could
find
witnesses
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
prove
a
case
against
him
i
understand
that
he
fired
at
this
fellow
called
yuma
the
clump
of
horses
hoofs
was
the
only
sound
for
several
moments
the
lone
ranger
saw
the
stream
of
water
shimmering
in
silver
light
ahead
just
beyond
he
knew
was
the
cave
suppose
muttered
yuma
bryant
was
the
leader
of
the
pack
who
else
could
be
certainly
cavendish
would
let
those
outsiders
run
his
ranch
for
him
and
i
do
think
any
of
the
nephews
could
pull
such
thick
wool
over
his
eyes
jest
suppose
that
what
lonergan
told
yuh
was
the
truth
what
was
that
that
yuma
was
the
boss
an
that
he
had
a
hold
on
bryant
an
bryant
had
tuh
do
what
he
wanted
suppose
that
was
the
case
what
you
do
naturally
i
hunt
for
yuma
bryant
went
tuh
town
now
he
could
have
got
back
in
time
tuh
have
killed
old
gimlet
then
rid
away
up
that
mountain
trail
yuh
mentioned
an
drilled
rangoon
like
yer
injun
pardner
told
of
now
could
he
if
he
went
to
red
oak
he
could
have
been
there
and
back
in
time
but
we
do
know
that
he
did
go
to
red
oak
but
this
gent
called
yuma
did
miss
penny
tell
yuh
he
was
still
around
after
bryant
left
yes
so
ai
it
logical
tuh
think
he
might
o
kilt
gimlet
jest
like
gimlet
said
then
rid
up
the
mountain
an
killed
rangoon
the
lone
ranger
could
scarcely
suppress
a
smile
at
the
thorough
reasoning
of
his
companion
he
urged
the
blond
man
to
continue
what
are
you
getting
at
he
said
me
i
ai
nothin
but
a
cowhand
an
ai
been
in
here
long
i
had
much
of
anything
tuh
do
yet
i
ai
no
way
important
tuh
you
now
if
i
was
tuh
tell
yuh
where
you
could
locate
this
yuma
yer
huntin
would
yuh
let
me
go
free
but
it
bryant
i
want
yuma
became
confidential
yer
wrong
wrong
the
other
nodded
that
what
i
said
bryant
yuh
want
at
all
it
yuma
is
the
leader
of
the
bunch
just
like
lonergan
said
the
lone
ranger
took
this
announcement
calmly
yuma
having
thought
the
thing
over
from
all
angles
felt
that
it
was
vitally
important
for
penny
sake
to
keep
this
masked
rider
whose
resolute
purpose
was
to
capture
bryant
from
doing
so
since
bryant
was
the
only
living
man
who
could
protect
the
girl
he
pressed
arguments
on
the
lone
ranger
using
everything
that
penny
had
previously
told
him
in
her
uncle
behalf
the
old
man
do
know
what
goin
on
about
the
place
no
more
he
said
he
ca
walk
around
no
more
ca
ride
much
ca
even
see
good
yer
barkin
up
the
wrong
tree
stranger
an
i
agoin
tuh
put
yuh
right
the
irony
of
it
if
only
yuma
in
the
misdirected
chivalry
of
his
glib
lies
could
have
known
that
it
was
he
and
not
the
uncle
she
felt
had
proved
faithless
that
the
girl
wanted
but
yuma
did
know
he
went
on
at
great
length
i
tell
yuh
jest
where
you
find
yuma
he
concluded
if
promise
tuh
turn
me
loose
the
lone
ranger
agreed
then
cut
the
ropes
on
my
hands
whoa
silver
whoa
thar
you
hoss
the
ropes
were
cut
yuma
chafed
his
hands
for
several
moments
while
he
scrutinized
the
gap
in
both
directions
and
weighed
his
chances
his
own
horse
was
fresh
the
masked
man
had
already
covered
many
miles
his
rifle
was
still
in
its
leather
scabbard
his
still
in
place
you
he
said
kneeing
his
horse
aside
want
tuh
know
whar
yuma
is
at
eh
the
tall
masked
man
nodded
wal
yer
lookin
right
at
him
a
gun
leaped
into
yuma
hand
i
as
soon
as
not
drill
yuh
clean
he
barked
in
a
harsh
loud
voice
but
if
yuh
leave
me
git
away
you
stay
alive
he
spurred
his
horse
with
such
a
force
that
the
beast
fairly
leaped
off
all
four
feet
at
once
another
instant
and
yuma
was
clattering
through
the
gap
away
from
bryant
basin
should
o
shot
him
he
thought
i
should
o
shot
him
but
instead
i
git
away
let
him
trail
me
let
him
spend
a
lifetime
me
it
keep
him
bryant
trail
heedless
of
the
risk
he
tore
ahead
wind
whipping
at
his
face
and
neckerchief
he
thought
of
penelope
and
something
choked
in
his
throat
at
least
the
girl
would
be
safe
while
bryant
lived
it
was
a
heedless
a
crazy
thing
he
done
but
at
the
time
it
seemed
the
only
thing
there
were
hopes
in
his
mind
hopes
that
he
could
circle
back
and
reach
bryant
tell
him
what
he
done
and
beg
the
patriarch
to
provide
for
penny
future
happiness
then
he
have
a
showdown
with
those
men
like
sawtell
and
lombard
and
the
worthless
cousins
kill
them
as
many
as
he
could
before
he
himself
was
dropped
wild
plans
plans
that
only
a
foolhardy
cowboy
like
yuma
could
concoct
he
did
know
why
he
had
shot
the
masked
man
perhaps
because
he
knew
there
would
be
others
to
investigate
the
texas
ranger
murders
and
the
basin
gang
no
murder
would
not
have
helped
it
would
simply
have
delayed
the
end
of
bryant
in
making
himself
the
confessed
criminal
the
leader
of
the
wolf
pack
he
had
done
the
only
thing
that
his
simple
mind
could
think
of
git
up
he
bellowed
and
the
horse
lunged
on
chapter

red

an
evening
there
was
a
jail
a
flimsy
structure
designed
to
hold
obnoxious
drunks
whose
cash
was
spent
slim
peasley
was
the
turnkey
the
office
was
one
that
would
have
been
beyond
his
scope
if
he
had
tried
to
fulfill
the
duties
of
a
deputy
sheriff
but
slim
did
he
shuffled
about
town
his
heavy
badge
weighting
down
his
dirty
limp
shirt
cadging
a
drink
where
he
could
and
prying
his
long
nose
like
a
chisel
into
things
that
were
none
of
his
concern
while
he
closed
his
eyes
to
flagrant
violations
of
civil
moral
and
spiritual
law
slim
seemed
to
have
no
chin
at
all
his
chest
was
in
a
hollow
made
by
rounded
shoulders
in
profile
the
most
striking
things
about
him
were
his
nose
and
adam
apple
he
had
a
close
resemblance
to
a
question
mark
his
stretched
suspenders
let
his
pants
drop
low
and
his
shirt
and
underwear
were
generally
apart
at
his
stomach
so
that
he
could
scratch
there
seemed
always
to
be
some
part
of
slim
anatomy
that
needed
scratching
and
the
degree
of
his
absorption
in
whatever
he
might
be
looking
at
could
be
measured
by
the
part
he
scratched
it
was
slim
peasley
who
had
locked
mort
cavendish
up
bryant
had
turned
his
nephew
over
to
the
deputy
at
nine
before
the
evening
in
red
oak
got
really
started
slim
had
actually
looked
frightened
when
he
found
he
have
to
guard
a
sober
man
until
the
sheriff
came
from
the
county
seat
to
take
over
when
bryant
placed
the
charge
of
murder
against
his
nephew
slim
grew
pale
only
stern
bryant
blustered
threats
made
slim
accept
the
responsibility
as
the
lesser
danger
then
bryant
had
limped
his
way
along
the
street
cursing
the
trollops
who
accosted
him
he
had
entered
the
hotel
and
rented
a
room
in
the
rear
of
the
first
floor
so
that
he
would
have
to
torture
himself
needlessly
with
stairs
he
was
asleep
when
the
evening
reached
a
peak
at
midnight
at
midnight
or
shortly
after
the
lone
ranger
reached
the
outskirts
of
red
oak
not
far
from
the
center
of
the
town
he
turned
off
the
trail
and
guided
silver
to
the
rear
of
the
row
of
buildings
on
one
side
he
felt
considerably
rested
after
dozing
in
the
saddle
during
the
ride
from
the
gap
and
ready
for
whatever
might
be
ahead
his
original
intention
to
talk
with
bryant
cavendish
had
not
been
changed
by
the
confession
of
his
prisoner
who
had
escaped
in
the
shadow
of
the
buildings
he
dismounted
and
left
silver
to
proceed
on
foot
coming
to
the
back
of
the
hotel
he
turned
and
passed
through
the
space
between
the
buildings
at
one
end
of
the
porch
he
halted
a
man
was
coming
along
the
road
the
lone
ranger
held
cupped
hands
close
to
his
face
as
if
in
the
act
of
lighting
a
pipe
the
gesture
together
with
his
hat
served
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
masked
he
had
to
be
extremely
careful
in
red
oak
there
were
people
there
in
the
town
who
had
known
him
as
a
texas
ranger
he
had
hoped
that
the
clerk
in
the
red
oak
hotel
would
be
a
stranger
and
that
with
his
mask
removed
and
his
face
somewhat
concealed
by
dust
he
could
inquire
as
to
the
location
of
bryant
room
he
was
however
spared
this
trouble
between
his
fingers
he
saw
the
overdressed
man
who
passed
him
mount
the
steps
and
enter
the
hotel
lobby
there
was
something
about
the
man
that
was
vaguely
familiar
yet
the
lone
ranger
was
sure
he
never
had
seen
him
before
he
heard
the
beautifully
shined
boots
clatter
on
the
floor
to
the
accompaniment
of
jingling
spurs
he
could
see
through
the
door
at
an
oblique
angle
he
heard
the
stranger
ask
about
bryant
cavendish
room
ten
the
clerk
said
curtly
an
he
left
strict
orders
that
he
was
tuh
be
pestered
that
too
bad
replied
the
other
because
i
going
tuh
disturb
him
plenty
right
now
the
clerk
tried
to
argue
but
got
nowhere
room
ten
marked
the
lone
ranger
he
left
his
post
beside
the
porch
and
hastened
to
the
rear
of
the
building
a
dark
window
from
room
ten
was
opened
wide
the
masked
man
crouched
beneath
it
as
he
heard
an
insistent
pounding
on
the
door
bryant
cavendish
groaned
first
in
sleep
and
then
in
waking
what
the
hell
he
grumbled
the
bed
creaked
then
the
rapping
on
the
door
again
snapped
bryant
i
sleepin
open
the
door
replied
a
muffled
voice
who
is
it
an
what
want
wallie
that
accounted
for
the
familiarity
in
the
man
face
wallie
cavendish
who
had
a
resemblance
in
the
eyes
and
forehead
to
both
vince
and
jeb
a
matchlight
flickered
in
the
room
and
then
the
steadier
light
of
a
candle
the
lone
ranger
risked
discovery
to
peer
over
the
edge
of
the
window
he
saw
bryant
shirtless
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
rubbing
his
eyes
sleepily
the
man
muttered
something
beneath
his
breath
then
rose
and
steadied
himself
by
gripping
the
edge
of
a
table
i
comin
he
called
wait
a
minute
the
old
man
had
to
resume
his
seat
on
the
bed
and
rub
his
knees
again
he
stood
and
this
time
managed
to
get
to
the
door
and
slip
the
bolt
the
lone
ranger
felt
guilty
at
his
eavesdropping
yet
he
felt
that
he
was
justified
in
gathering
what
facts
he
could
in
any
way
that
he
could
get
them
the
game
he
played
had
life
itself
as
the
stake
and
the
odds
were
against
him
to
begin
with
wallie
entered
the
bedroom
with
a
swaggering
manner
and
closed
the
door
behind
him

satisfaction
of

wallie
grinned
synthetically
his
whole
manner
before
bryant
cavendish
was
one
of
cowering
subjugation
of
fawning
in
a
way
that
must
have
been
revolting
to
the
hard
old
man
yuh
done

he
said

sharply
no

o
broke

that
jail
without

bryant

look
of
surprise
on
his
face
did
you

i

sleepin

how

slim
peasley
where

now
i

jest
heard
a
while
ago
in
one
of
the
saloons
that
he
was
loose
peasley
acted
real
upset
about
it
surprisingly
bryant
made
no
further
comment
wallie
waited
a
moment
longer
then
turned
and
opened
the
door
good
night
uncle
bryant
he
said
bryant
said
nothing
the
door
closed
and
the
old
man
sat
there
for
fully
five
minutes
muttering
unintelligibly
then
he
rose
and
would
have
blown
out
the
candle
but
he
was
halted
by
a
voice
from
the
window
stay
right
where
you
are
and
do
yell
the
lone
ranger
stepped
easily
over
the
low
windowsill
and
into
the
room
as
bryant
cavendish
turned
chapter
xxi
an
admission
from
bryant
cavendish
a
view
of
bryant
cavendish
fulfilled
everything
the
lone
ranger
might
have
expected
from
what
he
had
heard
about
him
his
face
looked
as
if
it
had
been
chopped
out
of
a
block
of
granite
his
eyes
small
were
the
coldest
hardest
eyes
that
he
had
ever
seen
they
were
the
eyes
of
a
man
who
would
die
before
he
would
forgive
a
wrong
a
man
who
had
lived
with
hate
bryant
showed
not
the
slightest
trace
of
fear
even
in
his
undershirt
he
could
look
haughty
and
arrogant
he
met
the
steady
gaze
of
the
masked
man
his
mouth
clamped
cavendish
began
the
lone
ranger
in
a
low
but
very
decisive
voice
i
come
a
long
way
to
talk
to
you
there
was
no
reply
first
of
all
what
do
you
know
about
the
murder
of
some
texas
rangers
in
bryant
gap
there
was
no
change
in
the
older
man
expression
his
chin
lifted
just
the
slightest
bit
but
he
said
nothing
neither
did
he
nod
or
shake
his
head
there
are
men
working
for
you
who
are
wanted
by
the
law
continued
the
lone
ranger
six
texas
rangers
went
through
the
gap
to
arrest
men
you
know
as
sawtell
rangoon
lonergan
and
lombard
those
rangers
were
ambushed
did
you
know
that
cavendish
spoke
his
voice
was
scarcely
more
than
a
whisper
but
the
intensity
of
it
the
suppressed
emotion
that
was
dripping
from
his
words
seemed
to
make
the
ends
of
the
masked
man
nerves
vibrate
you
he
said
git
not
yet
cavendish
we
have
a
lot
of
things
to
talk
about
the
lone
ranger
moved
nearer
to
the
bryant
and
sat
down
facing
the
open
window
with
his
back
against
the
door
there
a
renegade
army
of
bandits
across
the
border
they
been
buying
cattle
that
in
itself
has
been
handled
in
a
perfectly
legal
manner
the
cattle
have
been
sold
on
this
side
of
the
border
there
another
angle
to
it
however
ranches
surrounding
your
basin
land
have
been
struck
by
thieves
a
lot
of
cattle
have
been
stolen
and
several
men
have
been
murdered
these
assaults
have
been
generally
blamed
on
ricardo
renegades
but
that
has
been
the
case
ricardo
has
bought
your
cattle
and
the
stolen
cattle
have
been
herded
into
your
basin
the
lone
ranger
paused
it
looked
as
if
cavendish
were
about
to
speak
he
trembled
a
little
as
he
said
fer
the
last
time
stranger
not
yet
cavendish
i
tell
you
some
more
the
stolen
cattle
are
taken
into
the
basin
by
a
trail
that
comes
straight
down
one
side
of
thunder
mountain
once
in
the
basin
the
cattle
are
treated
to
a
running
iron
and
the
brand
changed
to
one
of
the
many
brands
that
are
registered
in
your
name
bar
stock
is
changed
to
the
box
becomes
the
i
could
go
on
with
many
other
brands
you
registered
brands
that
can
be
made
out
of
the
marks
on
stolen
cattle
the
newly
branded
stock
is
held
in
the
basin
until
the
scars
heal
over
then
it
is
taken
out
through
the
mountain
trail
while
other
stock
is
brought
in
now
you
realize
that
i
aware
of
what
is
going
on
bryant
agitation
could
never
have
been
caused
by
fear
therefore
it
must
have
been
an
anger
that
was
almost
consuming
him
the
lone
voice
became
sharper
as
he
went
on
driving
home
every
point
emphatically
he
himself
was
angry
the
stolid
manner
of
bryant
the
refusal
to
acknowledge
that
he
even
heard
the
masked
man
statements
called
for
will
power
that
was
almost
incomprehensible
in
the
face
of
the
cold
facts
in
connection
with
the
you
furnished
a
haven
for
any
outlaws
who
wanted
to
hide
there
i
do
know
how
you
contacted
all
those
fugitives
but
it
was
managed
somehow
they
learned
that
texas
rangers
had
been
sent
for
so
they
ambushed
those
men
if
others
go
there
they
will
either
meet
the
same
fate
or
find
a
perfectly
ranch
while
the
men
hide
in
the
mountain
retreat
am
i
right
bryant
cavendish
spoke
again
if
you
right
what
you
goin
to
do
about
it
you
have
a
niece
a
girl
named
penelope
mention
of
the
girl
name
brought
a
quick
reaction
bryant
hard
jaw
shot
forward
and
he
snapped
you
leave
her
out
o
this
i
sorry
but
i
ca
leave
her
out
it
for
her
that
i
speaking
she
has
always
trusted
you
cavendish
in
spite
of
everything
she
saw
the
type
of
men
you
hired
the
trail
on
thunder
mountain
in
spite
of
the
murder
of
the
texas
rangers
that
girl
has
believed
in
you
she
would
never
have
believed
you
capable
of
leading
a
gang
to
steal
the
cattle
that
ricardo
and
his
men
did
not
dare
to
steal
and
selling
them
to
him
at
a
low
enough
price
so
that
he
could
resell
at
a
profit
on
the
other
side
of
the
border
you
ask
what
i
going
to
do
i
going
to
ask
you
to
help
put
thieves
in
jail
and
send
murderers
to
pay
in
full
you
an
old
man
cavendish
at
best
you
have
but
a
few
years
left
and
after
that
what
is
there
for
penelope
who
is
going
to
take
care
of
that
girl
when
gone
would
you
leave
her
to
the
mercies
of
those
cousins
of
hers
or
the
killers
like
sawtell
and
lombard
i
lay
my
cards
right
out
on
the
table
i
ca
at
the
present
time
do
anything
that
why
i
come
to
you
there
must
be
something
that
turned
you
from
an
honest
man
to
this
what
is
it
tell
me
and
let
me
help
you
straighten
things
out
tell
me
who
has
a
hold
over
you
who
making
you
do
these
things
the
lone
ranger
drew
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
spread
it
on
the
table
before
bryant
cavendish
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
cavendish
who
seemed
to
be
waging
an
inward
battle
for
composure
cavendish
glanced
at
the
paper
then
at
the
lone
ranger
this
the
masked
man
said
is
a
document
that
lonergan
drew
up
it
has
a
place
for
your
relations
to
sign
their
names
and
when
they
do
so
they
accept
a
certain
consideration
from
you
and
agree
that
when
your
will
is
read
they
i
know
all
about
that
snapped
bryant
that
what
i
was
uncertain
about
your
signature
is
required
on
this
and
it
would
have
been
a
simple
matter
for
lonergan
to
have
written
it
and
had
your
relatives
sign
without
your
knowledge
cavendish
showed
more
of
an
inclination
to
talk
it
legal
ai
it
he
asked
as
if
there
were
some
doubt
in
his
mind
it
is
legal
that
all
i
want
tuh
know
you
wanted
it
prepared
sure
but
there
must
be
a
will
your
will
with
your
signature
that
would
have
to
be
left
to
name
the
people
who
inherit
all
your
land
there
a
will
too
all
signed
an
witnessed
bryant
pushed
himself
to
his
feet
and
stood
above
the
seated
masked
man
i
never
explained
nothin
he
barked
i
never
asked
fer
help
or
favors
an
i
never
will
when
the
time
comes
that
i
ca
handle
my
affairs
i
be
ready
tuh
lie
down
an
die
i
dunno
how
yuh
got
that
paper
but
yer
goin
tuh
hand
it
tuh
me
right
now
it
mine
an
have
it
you
wo
explain
a
thing
repeated
the
lone
ranger
you
heard
me
the
masked
man
rose
and
turned
to
face
the
other
squarely
taking
his
eyes
away
from
the
window
to
do
so
i
hoped
he
said
that
we
might
work
together
but
you
wo
have
it
that
way
if
you
sure
this
paper
is
just
the
way
you
want
it
the
lone
ranger
broke
off
when
a
shot
crashed
into
the
room
from
a
gun
beyond
the
window
bryant
cavendish
gasped
then
staggered
back
clutching
with
both
hands
at
his
broad
chest
he
stumbled
and
fell
across
the
bed
the
lone
ranger
gun
leaped
up
while
the
masked
man
sprang
to
the
window
he
saw
a
man
form
running
fast
it
was
too
dark
in
the
shadows
to
determine
much
about
the
fugitive
but
it
was
obvious
that
it
was
he
who
had
fired
the
shot
at
bryant
the
lone
ranger
gun
barked
and
a
silver
bullet
flew
the
running
man
spilled
forward
rolling
from
his
own
momentum
there
was
hammering
upon
the
door
men
shouts
demanded
to
know
what
the
shooting
was
about
the
lone
ranger
holstered
his
gun
ignoring
the
yells
and
shouts
outside
the
room
he
bent
over
the
wounded
man
bryant
still
breathed
but
his
pulse
was
ragged
and
his
eyes
were
closed
another
instant
and
those
outside
would
smash
the
door
and
force
their
way
inside
to
be
found
there
masked
with
cavendish
shot
and
one
bullet
gone
from
his
own
gun
would
mean
the
certain
capture
and
probable
lynching
of
the
lone
ranger
he
had
no
choice
he
lifted
bryant
cavendish
and
carried
him
toward
the
window
the
dead
weight
of
the
unconscious
man
was
too
much
for
the
lone
ranger
in
his
fatigued
and
weakened
condition
to
handle
quickly
he
rested
his
burden
on
the
window
sill
then
whistled
sharply
once
the
whistle
brought
renewed
shouting
from
the
men
beyond
the
door
their
cries
were
wild
and
unorganized
some
cried
to
the
world
at
large
bust
in
bust
down
the
door
do
let
out
he
in
thar
i
heard
him
these
and
other
cries
were
mixed
with
shouts
of
warning
and
advice
do
yuh
try
tuh
git
away
we
got
yuh
trapped
come
out
an
surrender
or
we
shoot
tuh
kill
if
only
the
door
and
the
bolt
would
withstand
the
assault
of
the
first
few
blows
silver
was
coming
fast
racing
toward
the
window
where
the
masked
man
waited
the
big
stallion
clattered
close
and
whinnied
shrilly
while
the
men
in
the
hall
yelled
new
suggestions
he
got
a
hoss
outside
git
around
tuh
the
winder
i
hear
a
hoss
thar
a
hull
gang
them
in
thar
in
a
moment
bryant
was
thrown
across
the
saddle
the
masked
man
leaped
behind
him
as
a
shattering
blow
shivered
the
door
and
the
wall
that
supported
it
come
on
silver
the
lone
ranger
called
he
could
leave
the
vicinity
just
yet
there
was
one
thing
of
which
he
must
make
certain
he
rode
to
the
man
he
shot
leaping
from
the
saddle
he
found
the
wounded
man
quite
conscious
but
in
pain
from
a
bullet
in
the
fleshy
part
of
his
thigh
not
serious
he
muttered
you
be
all
right
as
soon
as
he
broke
off
with
a
gasp
of
surprise
this
man
bullet
wound
was
slight
but
the
man
was
dying
there
was
another
weapon
a
knife
of
the
sort
that
can
be
easily
thrown
all
that
showed
was
the
handle
sticking
straight
out
from
the
back
of
the
stranger
neck
it
took
but
an
instant
for
the
lone
ranger
to
visualize
what
had
happened
this
fugitive
having
fired
at
bryant
cavendish
had
raced
on
foot
to
reach
a
clump
of
trees
perhaps
his
horse
was
waiting
there
perhaps
a
trusted
friend
this
friend
or
someone
else
within
the
shelter
of
the
trees
had
thrown
the
knife
after
the
lone
ranger
shot
had
dropped
the
man
probably
to
seal
his
lips
with
death
whatever
the
purpose
of
the
murder
the
man
on
the
ground
would
never
talk
it
was
little
short
of
miraculous
that
he
had
lived
at
all
after
taking
the
knife
in
such
a
vital
place
the
lone
ranger
could
do
nothing
the
man
slipped
into
unconsciousness
with
death
a
few
seconds
away
meanwhile
the
lone
ranger
was
in
danger
yelling
shouting
men
were
charging
some
on
foot
and
some
on
horseback
from
the
rear
of
the
hotel
there
was
no
time
for
thought
or
planning
the
only
important
thing
right
now
was
escape
the
lone
ranger
leaped
and
shouted
silver
the
stallion
lunged
ahead
while
bullets
buzzed
too
close
leaning
low
over
the
strong
neck
of
silver
the
masked
man
clung
to
bryant
cavendish
now
he
thought
those
men
will
not
only
think
shot
cavendish
but
shot
and
killed
that
other
man
as
well
he
slapped
silver
on
the
neck
old
boy
he
cried
from
now
on
we
got
to
travel
fast
if
they
catch
us
it
will
mean
a
lynching
chapter
xxii
stalemate
the
shooting
aftermath
in
red
oak
some
insisted
that
a
posse
be
formed
at
once
to
scour
the
country
for
the
unknown
rider
who
had
taken
bryant
cavendish
with
him
others
were
in
favor
of
letting
the
law
represented
by
slim
peasley
take
its
fumbling
course
while
the
majority
asked
resentfully
what
the
hell
the
disturbance
was
all
about
then
turned
back
to
drinks
games
women
or
combinations
of
the
same
wallie
cavendish
was
much
in
evidence
for
once
in
his
life
looking
and
somewhat
disheveled
he
insisted
that
prompt
action
be
taken
that
something
be
done
about
his
uncle
abduction
a
hell
of
a
lot
you
care
about
him
snapped
jim
bates
the
hotel
owner
now
he
gone
yuh
know
damn
well
yer
ready
tuh
let
out
a
war
whoop
of
plain
an
fancy
cheerin
wallie
ignored
the
comment
and
spoke
to
the
group
assembled
in
the
lobby
it
high
time
there
was
some
law
around
this
place
first
mort
gets
out
of
jail
without
then
uncle
bryant
carried
away
likely
dead
an
all
we
got
is
that
peasley
that
man
on
the
white
horse
was
leaning
over
someone
when
he
was
seen
was
he
someone
in
the
crowd
said
yeah
well
what
about
him
is
anything
bein
done
he
bein
brought
in
here
some
of
the
boys
went
tuh
see
about
him
high
time
barked
wallie
with
a
fire
that
was
unusual
the
boys
that
had
horses
handy
went
after
that
critter
explained
jim
bates
maybe
they
catch
him
and
if
they
do
said
wallie
they
jail
him
the
same
as
they
did
mort
an
ten
minutes
after
slim
back
turned
he
be
again
i
thought
you
had
a
hunch
said
jim
bates
that
it
was
yer
uncle
bryant
that
let
mort
out
of
the
calaboose
that
what
i
thought
mebbe
this
that
rid
away
wo
have
no
uncle
bryant
tuh
let
him
loose
the
door
opened
and
men
came
in
carrying
a
still
form
which
they
placed
on
the
plank
floor
near
the
wall
he
dead
one
of
them
said
looking
at
wallie
with
a
strange
expression
is
it
anyone
we
know
asked
bates
one
of
the
newcomers
nodded
seriously
yup
it
shore
is
he
stood
aside
one
leg
showed
the
red
result
of
a
bullet
wound
but
this
was
hardly
more
than
a
scratch
in
the
back
of
his
neck
the
handle
of
a
knife
still
showed
the
man
was
mort
cavendish
my
brother
exclaimed
wallie
it
mort
he
wheeled
to
the
silent
men
around
him
who
done
this
he
asked
who
want
to
kill
poor
mort
he
never
hurt
no
one
in
his
life
he
jim
bates
stepped
up
listen
tuh
me
he
said
sharply
we
do
want
none
of
yer
crocodile
actin
around
here
in
the
first
place
whoever
stuck
that
knife
in
mort
neck
saved
him
bein
strung
up
tuh
hang
fer
killin
his
wife
you
know
that
damned
well
in
the
second
place
yuh
never
gave
a
damn
about
any
of
yer
family
an
yuh
still
do
with
mort
done
fer
it
jest
one
less
tuh
whack
up
bryant
basin
wallie
stood
a
moment
then
he
said
in
a
calmer
voice
all
right
bates
bryant
gone
an
mort
killed
now
let
figure
out
who
done
it
what
the
hell
care
wallie
was
obviously
not
well
liked
by
the
men
in
red
oak
their
manner
showed
that
they
cared
nothing
about
helping
him
the
man
who
died
had
deserved
killing
and
no
sympathy
was
wasted
if
the
murderer
had
walked
in
at
that
moment
it
was
quite
likely
that
he
would
have
been
told
that
his
duty
was
to
handle
the
burial
expenses
as
a
moral
obligation
then
take
drinks
on
the
house
only
thing
i
do
like
muttered
someone
is
this
knifin
business
it
ai
good
form
why
the
hell
when
that
critter
dropped
mort
with
the
shot
in
the
leg
did
he
finish
him
with
another
slug
o
stickin
him
like
this
you
ca
leave
him
there
said
jim
bates
what
want
done
with
the
remains
wallie
dug
into
his
pocket
and
dumped
what
cash
he
had
on
the
hotel
desk
you
handle
things
he
told
bates
have
the
coroner
do
whatever
has
to
be
done
then
hire
someone
with
a
cart
to
haul
him
to
the
basin
i
have
him
buried
there
bates
nodded
scooping
up
the
cash
i
tend
tuh
things
whatever
mort
had
in
his
pockets
was
took
out
by
peasley
when
he
jailed
him
i
reckon
you
get
his
cash
an
whatever
else
he
had
from
slim
i
will
hold
on
said
bates
old
bryant
has
a
buckboard
an
team
in
the
shed
he
brought
when
he
came
why
do
you
take
mort
back
in
that
yer
own
self
wallie
explained
that
he
was
leaving
shortly
and
would
drive
the
team
and
ride
the
buckboard
with
his
own
horse
hitched
behind
he
had
to
hurry
though
and
did
care
to
wait
until
the
coroner
work
was
finished
in
fact
he
planned
to
start
back
for
the
basin
right
away
he
wanted
to
be
there
by
daybreak
all
right
then
said
bates
i
see
that
everything
tended
to
further
conversation
and
conjecture
was
carried
to
the
nearest
saloon
the
general
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
bryant
had
helped
his
nephew
out
of
jail
then
someone
unknown
had
called
upon
bryant
mort
had
found
him
there
when
trying
to
sneak
into
the
room
the
unknown
man
had
fired
but
mort
had
run
away
the
gunman
had
fired
again
and
this
time
he
hit
bryant
blood
on
the
bed
proved
that
bryant
had
been
hit
then
pursuit
of
mort
who
ran
despite
the
wounded
leg
led
to
his
final
death
by
stabbing
the
eyewitnesses
from
the
hotel
room
had
first
seen
the
stranger
with
the
white
horse
standing
close
to
mort
that
was
just
before
he
had
ridden
away
this
explanation
suited
everyone
and
further
action
was
dependent
on
slim
peasley
which
meant
that
there
probably
would
be
no
further
investigation
wallie
went
from
place
to
place
locating
the
men
from
the
basin
telling
them
what
had
happened
and
suggesting
that
they
start
at
once
for
home
he
was
the
last
to
leave
red
oak
by
the
time
he
had
driven
the
buckboard
through
the
rough
rocky
bottom
of
the
gap
the
cowhands
had
been
home
for
some
time
when
he
drove
in
at
daybreak
he
found
them
still
awake
and
excited
over
the
discovery
of
old
gimlet
they
had
found
sawtell
rangoon
lombard
or
lonergan
in
the
bunkhouse
dunno
where
the
hell
them
boys
went
they
said
they
do
dare
risk
goin
tuh
red
oak
because
yuh
never
can
tell
when
the
sheriff
be
there
or
maybe
a
ranger
or
some
gent
that
recognize
an
turn
in
fer
the
reward
wallie
was
tired
and
annoyed
at
the
missing
quartet
he
ordered
fresh
horses
hitched
to
the
buckboard
gave
instructions
for
the
disposal
of
old
gimlet
body
then
went
to
the
house
throwing
open
the
door
he
stopped
abruptly
a
strange
sight
greeted
him
one
lamp
was
lighted
though
the
wick
was
turned
low
there
was
sufficient
illumination
to
reveal
disorder
in
the
room
on
top
of
a
table
a
chair
on
the
chair
a
log
braced
against
the
beamed
ceiling
sitting
near
the
fireplace
wallie
saw
an
indian
furiously
angry
he
started
forward
then
halted
again
the
indian
was
holding
a
heavy
revolver
in
his
hand
what
the
started
wallie
you
muttered
the
indian
close
door
sit

for
what

the
indian
replied
she
tell

a
howl
from
beneath
his
feet

wallie

grinned
at
his
surprise
bad
feller
he
explained
down
there

penelope
wrapped
in

down
the
stairs
daybreak
found
the
lone
ranger
once
more
in
the
saddle
he
rode
slowly
at
first
but
as
the
light
increased
and
made
the
trail
he
followed
more
distinct
he
increased
his
speed
with
several
hours
rest
the
masked
man
felt
much
better
tonto
he
was
sure
could
handle
things
at
the
ranch
house
until
wallie
returned
the
indian
position
there
would
be
explained
by
penny
bryant
cavendish
had
been
left
in
the
cave
now
the
lone
ranger
rode
in
pursuit
of
yuma
wallie
with
the
wagon
and
all
the
horsemen
going
to
the
basin
had
passed
close
to
the
cave
in
bryant
gap
while
the
masked
man
and
bryant
cavendish
were
there
the
hoofs
of
these
men
horses
had
in
many
cases
blotted
out
the
tracks
of
yuma
but
an
occasional
mark
where
the
shale
was
soft
assured
the
masked
man
that
he
was
still
on
the
trail
of
the
one
he
sought
there
were
times
when
he
had
to
dismount
and
examine
the
ground
closely
to
make
sure
he
had
gone
astray
then
he
found
that
yuma
had
left
the
gap
new
scratches
on
the
rocks
of
one
side
of
it
showed
where
his
horse
had
fought
its
way
up
an
almost
sheer
ascent
to
gain
the
level
land
above
the
lone
ranger
guided
silver
up
the
same
path
now
the
ground
covered
in
most
places
by
a
sort
of
turf
was
softened
by
the
recent
rains
and
held
distinct
hoofprints
of
the
big
cowpuncher
horse
come
on
silver
the
lone
ranger
called
as
he
saw
the
trail
stretching
out
toward
the
horizon
the
stallion
fairly
flew
over
the
ground
that
felt
so
soft
after
the
sharp
and
sliding
stones
of
the
gap
the
marks
of
yuma
horse
were
spaced
to
show
that
it
too
had
traveled
at
top
speed
but
yuma
had
ridden
in
the
darkness
which
was
probably
the
reason
that
his
horse
had
fallen
the
lone
ranger
saw
the
gopher
hole
into
which
the
horse
had
stepped
and
near
by
the
body
of
the
horse
itself
he
dismounted
and
examined
the
ground
marks
clearly
showed
that
yuma
had
spilled
over
the
head
of
the
falling
horse
the
dead
horse
was
a
few
yards
distant
the
foreleg
to
judge
from
its
position
unquestionably
was
broken
a
bullet
through
the
head
had
ended
the
beast
suffering
yuma
had
taken
the
most
essential
things
from
his
duffle
and
left
the
rest
his
footprints
led
on
in
the
same
direction
he
been
going
the
masked
man
mounted
and
rode
on
it
was
long
before
he
saw
a
pile
of
rocks
they
were
huge
boulders
tossed
into
the
middle
of
an
open
plain
as
if
left
and
forgotten
by
the
builder
in
some
era
eons
ago
when
the
world
was
made
the
footprints
led
directly
toward
these
rocks
that
mused
the
lone
ranger
is
where
the
man
i
want
has
taken
refuge
i
wonder
if
he
shoot
i
doubt
it
he
rode
ahead
considering
the
type
of
man
he
had
to
face
what
he
had
seen
of
yuma
had
left
a
rather
favorable
impression
when
the
cowboy
had
claimed
leadership
of
the
organization
the
lone
ranger
had
doubted
the
truth
of
what
he
said
it
had
seemed
obvious
that
yuma
sought
to
shield
bryant
cavendish
in
order
that
the
old
man
might
remain
alive
and
free
to
safeguard
penny
the
masked
man
slowed
silver
to
a
walk
and
drew
his
gun
he
advanced
slowly
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
rocks
presently
the
head
popped
out
then
a
quick
shot
struck
the
ground
a
little
to
one
side
of
the
lone
ranger
he
rode
on
slowly
a
hundred
yards
away
from
the
natural
fortress
the
masked
man
dismounted
then
went
forward
on
foot
i
coming
to
get
you
yuma
he
shouted
i
wo
be
taken
alive
came
the
reply
git
aboard
that
hoss
vamoose
i
do
want
tuh
drill
yuh
the
lone
ranger
walked
ahead
another
shot
this
time
one
that
whistled
as
it
passed
the
space
had
narrowed
down
to
fifty
yards
when
yuma
cried
again
stand
back
i
tell
yuh
stranger
i
do
want
tuh
kill
yuh
yuh
take
me
alive
them
shots
was
only
warnin
now
go
back
the
masked
man
made
no
reply
nor
did
he
change
his
pace
or
course
long
strides
carried
him
ahead
he
held
one
gun
in
readiness
but
return
the
shots
that
had
been
fired
toward
him
thirty
yards
away
in
the
name
of
god
shouted
yuma
you
goin
tuh
make
me
kill
yuh
this
is
yer
last
chance
now
turn
back
the
lone
ranger
took
five
more
strides
forward
then
yuma
fired
again
this
time
the
bullet
tugged
at
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt
yuma
was
either
shooting
to
kill
and
missing
or
shooting
with
rare
skill
to
come
as
close
as
he
could
without
inflicting
injury
while
he
walked
forward
the
lone
ranger
called
again
you
know
you
not
going
to
kill
me
yuma
because
if
you
do
there
be
others
here
to
take
my
place
coming
to
ram
your
lies
down
your
throat
his
heavy
gun
was
still
unfired
ten
paces
from
the
rock
he
halted
i
can
put
a
bullet
through
you
yuma
the
next
time
you
look
out
from
behind
that
rock
to
fire
at

shouted

i
waiting

the
lone
ranger
replied
if
yuh
do
turn
back
when
i
count
three
i
fire
yuma
started
counting
slowly
one
two
and
then
a
pause
fer
the
love
of
heaven
turn
back
i
still
waiting
yuma
god
knows
yuh
asked
fer
it
yuma
shouted
three
and
then
leaped
out
from
behind
the
rock
and
fired
chapter
xxiii
yuma
rides
behind
a
masked
man
the
lone
ranger
almost
fired
instinctively
at
yuma
his
finger
tightened
on
the
trigger
but
he
caught
himself
in
time
yuma
last
quick
shot
went
wide
the
cowboy
stood
entirely
clear
of
the
rocks
that
had
protected
him
holding
his
gun
on
the
masked
man
for
a
moment
the
two
stood
there
tense
each
one
covering
the
other
neither
moving
neither
firing
then
yuma
let
out
a
wild
cry
as
he
threw
his
on
the
ground
you
win
hang
it
all
i
ca
shoot
yuh
come
on
an
take
me
prisoner
the
lone
ranger
closed
the
space
he
holstered
his
own
gun
then
bent
and
picked
up
yuma
weapon
put
this
where
it
belongs
he
said
extending
the
weapon
first
in
your
holster
you
probably
be
needing
it
again
there
were
tears
of
futility
in
yuma
eyes
i
dunno
he
said
accepting
the
gun
what
in
hell
the
matter
with
me
why
did
i
shoot
yuh
why
i
let
yuh
take
me
because
you
not
a
killer
replied
the
masked
man
simply
the
hell
i
ai
i
the
man
that
just
a
minute
yuma
you
tried
to
tell
me
that
you
were
the
leader
of
the
basin
gang
in
spite
of
that
i
went
in
to
red
oak
last
night
i
found
bryant
cavendish
there
i
showed
him
a
document
that
his
friends
were
trying
to
make
penelope
sign
and
he
admitted
that
it
was
just
the
way
he
had
dictated
it
i
want
you
to
look
it
over
he
took
the
paper
from
his
pocket
unfolded
it
and
handed
it
to
yuma
then
he
stood
patiently
silent
to
give
the
big
blond
man
a
chance
to
read
it
yuma
seemed
to
find
some
difficulty
in
wading
through
the
legal
terms
and
phrases
he
guided
his
eyes
from
one
word
to
the
next
with
his
finger
and
when
he
finished
he
said
does
this
mean
that
penny
tuh
have
no
part
o
bryant
property
when
he
kicks
in
the
lone
ranger
said
some
of
the
relatives
of
the
old
man
have
already
signed
it
penny
among
them
yuma
looked
at
the
signatures
then
she
done
outen
her
share
according
to
that
penelope
will
have
no
claim
on
the
land
unless
bryant
wills
it
to
her
when
she
signed
that
she
lost
all
her
faith
in
bryant
cavendish
furthermore
i
doubt
if
bryant
will
be
able
to
give
her
much
protection
now
why
not
he
was
shot
last
night
shot
the
lone
ranger
nodded
then
went
on
to
tell
yuma
the
events
in
red
oak
relating
what
he
had
heard
of
mort
imprisonment
and
ultimate
escape
the
shot
that
was
fired
at
bryant
and
the
knifing
of
the
man
who
fired
that
shot
i
was
not
seen
he
said
but
they
must
have
had
a
look
at
my
horse
and
they
certainly
heard
me
call
the
horse
silver
i
no
doubt
that
i
be
accused
of
both
the
shooting
of
bryant
cavendish
and
the
knifing
of
the
man
who
really
shot
him
yuma
nodded
comprehension
and
agreement
the
same
sort
o
killin
that
old
gimlet
got
he
said
thoughtfully
i
reckon
the
same
skunk
done
both
knifin
quite
likely
now
bryant
wo
be
able
tuh
guard
miss
penny
no
more
bein
that
dead
i
did
say
that
he
was
dead
then
he
ai
dead
no
how
close
to
it
is
he
there
a
good
chance
for
him
to
recover
i
have
him
hidden
in
a
cave
in
the
gap
yuma
reflected
on
the
things
that
he
been
told
he
muttered
half
aloud
and
then
quite
suddenly
went
berserk
he
snatched
off
his
hat
whirled
it
about
his
head
several
times
then
threw
it
on
the
ground
he
jumped
on
it
with
both
feet
while
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
his
face
was
livid
with
blind
rage
and
fury
he
swore
with
the
sincerity
of
a
hen
with
chicks
and
the
vocabulary
of
a
mule
skinner
he
called
himself
an
addleheaded
jackass
and
a
crackbrained
fool
in
mexican
as
well
as
english
he
berated
his
bungling
fumbling
thoughtless
notions
and
cursed
himself
for
trying
to
help
penny
by
the
loco
means
he
used
he
ranted
raved
and
raged
because
he
taken
blame
that
properly
belonged
to
a
soulless
old
son
of
a
rattler
meaning
bryant
cavendish
he
declared
with
rare
vehemence
that
bryant
deserved
boiling
in
hot
coal
oil
then
skinning
alive
before
he
ran
out
of
things
to
say
his
breath
gave
out
and
he
was
forced
to
stop
and
gasp
his
face
was
red
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
from
emotion
he
grabbed
the
front
of
the
lone
ranger
shirt
in
one
huge
hand
listen
he
said
breathlessly
listen
tuh
me
i
lied
when
i
said
i
was
the
leader
o
them
murderin
skunks
an
cattle
rustlers
it

that
the

the
lone
ranger
interrupted
you
did
want
bryant
to
be
taken
away
from
penelope
because
he
alone
could
safeguard
her
yuma
still
clutched
the
masked
man
shirt
it
happened
that
his
hand
had
closed
over
the
breast
pocket
and
in
that
pocket
rested
the
texas
ranger
badge
i
came
for
you
the
lone
ranger
went
on
because
it
is
you
that
penelope
needs

repeated
yuma
eagerly
and
then
in
a
voice
filled
with
woe
that
ai
so
i

the
way
she
acted
tuh
me
if
i
go
around
where

my

the
lone

explained
that
there
had
to
be
some
charge
filed
against
bryant
cavendish
to
put
him
in
jail
once
there
he
could
be
questioned
endlessly
until
his
part
in
the
cattle
stealing
and
the
murders
was
brought
out
merely
killing
the
man
would
do
nothing
to
solve
the
killing
of
the
texas
rangers
of
gimlet
or
the
man
who
fired
at
him
the
night
before
yuma
finally
agreed
to
follow
the
lone
ranger
advice
to
do
whatever
he
was
told
but
went
on
record
that
he
was
sure

chapter

bryant
goes
home
bryant
cavendish
sitting
in
the
cave
felt
curiously
at
ease
his
wound
was
almost
superficial
and
because
of
the
first
aid
which
his
masked
abductor
had
applied
caused
him
no
discomfort
whatsoever
his
only
inconvenience
was
the
lashings
about
his
wrists
and
ankles
that
made
him
helpless
yet
it
was
this
helplessness
that
gave
him
the
odd
feeling
of
being
relaxed
for
the
first
time
that
he
could
remember
there
was
not
a
thing
that
he
felt
he
should
be
doing
or
supervising
with
nothing
that
could
be
done
he
felt
no
pangs
in
idleness
he
had
been
furiously
angry
at
first
when
he
realized
that
he
been
carried
away
bodily
it
was
a
bitter
blow
to
his
pride
the
trip
from
red
oak
had
been
humiliating
as
well
as
exhausting
but
now
the
old
man
almost
gloried
in
his
helplessness
he
sat
trying
to
recall
vague
moments
in
the
past
half
day
he
could
remember
little
after
the
shot
in
his
hotel
room
he
must
have
been
unconscious
during
most
of
the
trip
from
red
oak
to
the
gap
the
masked
man
was
in
the
gap
when
bryant
recovered
his
senses
and
explained
in
a
soft
voice
exactly
where
the
two
were
going
then
there
had
been
a
session
in
the
cave
when
the
first
aid
was
administered
by
candlelight
darkness
again
and
a
resonant
kindly
voice
that
said
you
be
all
right
here
for
the
time
being
i
going
to
ride
out
again
but
i
be
here
when
you
waken
at
daybreak
bryant
had
slept
after
that
and
wakened
to
find
the
masked
man
promise
fulfilled
the
stranger
was
with
him
but
not
for
long
he
rode
off
on
the
horse
called
silver
shortly
after
daybreak
bryant
had
heard
a
team
and
wagon
coming
close
his
shouts
were
answered
when
the
wagon
stopped
and
an
indian
scaled
the
ledge
and
entered
the
cave
bryant
had
demanded
that
the
indian
release
him
but
there
had
been
no
sign
that
the
newcomer
could
understand
the
white
man
tongue
bryant
resented
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
inspected
by
the
redskin
the
way
the
ropes
and
their
knots
were
critically
examined
then
the
way
his
bandage
was
removed
the
wound
studied
carefully
and
then
redressed
the
indian
had
made
no
comment
whatsoever
he
finished
his
investigation
and
then
left
the
cave
after
a
lapse
of
several
moments
the
team
and
buckboard
moved
away
bryant
had
noted
that
the
outfit
came
from
the
basin
and
headed
in
the
opposite
direction
another
hour
elapsed
then
yuma
came
and
when
the
cowboy
came
he
made
it
known
his
entrance
was
accompanied
by
a
shout
you
he
bellowed
yuh
damned
dirty
schemin
crook
yuh
i
had
tuh
come
here
an
tell
yuh

bryant
looked
up
with
his
jaw
set
in
its
customary
stubborn
way

yuma
that

from

gullet

hope

yuh
why

yuma
launched
into
some
of
the
most
colorful
expressions
the
lone
ranger
still
outside
the
cave
had
ever
heard

tried
tuh
drill
me
he
went
on
fer
that
i
got
every
right
tuh
put
a
bullet
through

but
i
ai
agoin

be
too
damned
easy
fer

if

in

right
back
at
anyone
that
had
anything
tuh
say
yuh
but
shucks
loyalty
o
that
sort
is
somethin
yore
kind
would
savvy
yuma
shouted
the
lone
ranger
from
outside
that
will
do
the
masked
man
entered
the
cave
and
yuma
turning
noticed
that
he
held
a
folded
paper
in
his
hand
i
told
you
that
you
stop
here
just
long
enough
to
get
a
horse
then
head
for
town
i
know
said
yuma
apologetically
i
seen
this
old
crook
though
an
i
jest
could
help
poppin
off
an
lettin
him
know
what
i
thought
o
him
well
you
said
enough
now
take
the
horse
and
get
started
yuma
nodded
and
passed
his
masked
ally
he
dropped
over
the
ledge
and
checked
the
cinch
on
a
big
bay
that
stood
near
silver
it
was
a
horse
that
the
lone
ranger
had
provided
before
he
rested
in
the
cave
after
his
arrival
there
with
bryant
he
had
gone
to
the
basin
found
the
animal
then
saddled
it
and
brought
it
here
his
intention
had
been
to
use
it
for
bryant
when
the
two
left
their
cavern
hideout
now
however
yuma
needed
the
horse
so
the
masked
man
and
bryant
would
both
ride
silver
yuma
mounted
and
called
i
on
my
way
in
another
moment
the
cowpuncher
was
gone
then
the
lone
ranger
moved
close
to
bryant
he
spoke
softly
is
there
anything
you
care
to
say
to
me
now
bryant
made
no
reply
he
simply
stared
unblinkingly
at
the
mask
yuma
was
pretty
hard
on
you
the
lone
ranger
said
i
sorry
that
he
acted
as
he
did
but
there
is
still
a
lot
that
you
do
understand
do
you
feel
strong
enough
to
leave
here
bryant
snarled
i
strong
enough
tuh
do
anything
you
do
good
we
are
going
to
your
home
in
the
basin
sort
of
nervy
ai
yuh
why
yuh
wo
live
ten
minutes
after
i
git
there
amongst
my
men
we
see
about
that
there
are
some
things
that
i
want
to
tell
you
we
talk
about
them
as
we
ride
i
ai
ridin
in
there
i
going
to
untie
you
it
was
but
the
work
of
a
moment
to
free
the
old
man
then
the
lone
ranger
aided
him
to
his
feet
bryant
tried
to
push
away
the
masked
man
help
but
found
himself
unable
to
stand
without
some
aid
grumbling
something
about
bein
weak
from
loss
of
blood
bryant
permitted
himself
to
be
helped
down
the
ledge
and
to
the
saddle
the
lone
ranger
leaped
behind
him
and
the
two
were
on
their
way
wallie
was
sitting
idly
on
the
front
porch
of
the
house
when
the
two
arrived
he
leaped
to
his
feet
at
the
sight
of
bryant
riding
with
the
masked
man
the
lone
ranger
already
had
a
gun
in
readiness
and
spoke
quite
casually
when
he
saw
wallie
reaching
for
a
weapon
i
would
if
i
were
you
wallie
hand
froze
to
the
gun
butt
he
did
draw
where
did
you
come
from
he
demanded
then
to
his
uncle
he
said
in
a
more
fawning
tone
uncle
bryant
i
been
worried
sick
about
yuh
ever
since
last
night
when
yuh
was
shot
at
the
hell
you
have
snarled
bryant
yuh
did
stick
around
town
very
long
tuh
see
what
happened
to
me
but
there
was
any
use
hangin
around
there
explained
the
one
we
all
seen
yuh
carried
off
on
that
white
hoss
right
after
yuh
left
we
found
that
it
was
mort
that
that
stranger
killed
mort
snapped
bryant
is
he
dead
wallie
explained
the
events
of
the
previous
night
while
he
helped
to
ease
bryant
cavendish
from
the
saddle
to
the
ground
the
lone
ranger
stood
slightly
back
letting
wallie
help
his
uncle
his
keen
eyes
shot
quick
glances
in
all
directions
the
lone
ranger
saw
men
going
casually
about
their
various
tasks
but
he
also
saw
men
who
seemed
to
have
no
tasks
at
least
six
of
these
stood
idly
about
each
one
he
knew
watching
him
intently
waiting
for
a
signal
from
bryant
cavendish
his
life
would
be
worth
much
if
the
command
to
capture
him
were
given
he
dared
not
relax
his
vigilance
for
a
split
second
we
go
into
the
house
he
told
wallie
i
follow
you
to
own
bedroom
get
him
into
bed
he
pretty
tired
i
take
care
of
him
when
he
there
wallie
started
to
object
but
bryant
cut
him
off
shortly
do
what
he
says
the
three
crossed
the
porch
and
entered
the
large
living
room
the
masked
man
noticed
that
the
cordwood
the
chair
and
the
table
still
made
a
brace
between
the
beam
of
the
ceiling
and
the
trapdoor
in
the
floor
bryant
asked
about
the
room
upset
condition
wallie
said
tell
yuh
about
that
later
uncle
bryant
first
of
all
we
want
tuh
get
yuh
in
bed
where
yuh
rest
up
you
tell
me
now
barked
bryant
i
want
tuh
know
what
been
done
tuh
this
yere
room
the
lone
ranger
stood
at
the
closed
door
while
wallie
told
as
briefly
as
possible
about
the
capture
of
the
outlaws
by
the
masked
man
and
their
subsequent
guarding
by
tonto
he
explained
that
he
had
found
the
indian
on
guard
when
he
came
in
and
that
between
tonto
and
penelope
he
had
been
told
the
entire
story
i
did
have
any
idea
he
said
that
we
had
killers
on
the
payroll
here
i
never
had
much
to
do
with
the
runnin
of
things
you
know
yuh
would
have
retorted
bryant
if
yuh
spent
more
time
here
an
less
time
in
red
oak
saloons
i
guess
it
must
have
been
vince
an
mort
that
hired
those
men
continued
wallie
in
a
placating
manner
but
we
see
that
taken
care
of
now
that
we
know
who
they
are
bryant
cavendish
then
demanded
where
penny
oh
i
told
you
last
night
uncle
bryant
that
she
was
to
go
to
red
oak
with
the
kids
an
stay
with
that
woman
i
lined
up
there
i
did
say
it
be
all
right
fer
her
tuh
go
i
told
yuh
tuh
find
some
female
that
come
here
an
take
care
of
the
kids
but
i
thought
never
mind
what
yuh
thought
how
penny
get
tuh
red
oak
well
she
seemed
to
put
a
lot
o
trust
in
that
indian
an
he
was
willin
to
drive
her
there
with
the
buckboard
so
i
let
him
do
it
they
left
at
daybreak
takin
the
kids
with
wallie
looked
at
bryant
as
if
anticipating
an
outburst
because
permitted
the
girl
to
leave
the
basin
in
an
indian
care
but
bryant
simply
nodded
i
reckon
he
said
softly
penelope
must
have
passed
right
by
me
wonder
why
she
did
say
somethin
when
i
yelled
the
redskin
heard
me
why
did
penelope
his
question
was
not
answered
he
leaned
heavily
on
the
railing
of
the
staircase
while
wallie
walked
beside
him
with
the
masked
man
close
behind
a
window
in
the
hallway
on
the
second
floor
looked
out
toward
the
corral
the
lone
ranger
glanced
in
that
direction
and
saw
the
cowhands
their
work
ignored
converging
on
the
ranch
house
he
noticed
also
that
their
hands
were
on
the
butts
of
their
holstered
he
had
noticed
something
else
that
did
diminish
his
apprehension
the
furniture
and
firewood
that
he
had
placed
to
block
any
attempt
to
leave
the
cellar
vault
had
been
moved
since
his
last
visit
true
the
table
still
rested
on
the
trapdoor
but
in
a
slightly
different
position
when
bryant
finally
entered
his
bedroom
the
lone
ranger
closed
the
door
and
stood
just
to
one
side
he
studied
every
detail
of
the
big
room
while
wallie
helped
old
bryant
get
into
the
heavy
oak
bed
at
the
far
wall
the
room
was
well
equipped
with
furniture
there
were
three
large
chairs
a
big
round
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
a
desk
against
one
wall
and
the
usual
bedroom
equipment
of
commode
pitcher
and
basin
the
desk
was
something
to
behold
it
seemed
to
have
half
a
hundred
pigeonholes
each
one
of
which
bulged
to
the
bursting
point
with
folded
papers
there
was
a
curious
thing
about
it
in
some
of
the
small
compartments
the
papers
were
tucked
in
neatly
while
in
others
the
assorted
documents
were
jammed
in
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
careless
haste
another
point
was
that
the
pigeonholes
were
all
at
one
end
of
the
desk
the
masked
man
made
a
mental
note
to
have
a
closer
look
at
the
desk
at
his
earliest
opportunity
wallie
pulled
a
counterpane
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
covered
bryant
reckon
you
be
all
right
now
uncle
he
said
consolingly
if
there
anything
more
that
i
do
there
ai
barked
bryant
wallie
looked
at
the
tall
man
with
the
mask
i
speak
to
you
in
the
hall
the
lone
ranger
said
willie
said
right
you
lead
the
way
wallie
opened
the
door
and
went
out
with
the
masked
man
close
behind
there
are
a
lot
of
things
the
lone
ranger
said
when
the
door
had
been
closed
that
i
must
explain
to
you
cavendish
you
no
doubt
wondering
about
the
mask
i
wearing
i
tell
you
this
much
about
who
i
am
i
a
friend
of
the
indian
you
found
here
i
know
that
much
said
wallie
i
came
here
to
find
out
who
directed
the
murder
of
those
texas
rangers
who
were
killed
in
the
gap
you
probably
have
heard
that
someone
wearing
moccasins
attended
to
their
burial
the
other
nodded
you
probably
guessed
by
this
time
that
the
man
who
buried
them
was
that
same
indian
well
that
the
truth
those
men
i
locked
in
the
basement
of
this
house
of
course
had
a
hand
in
the
massacre
but
there
was
someone
who
gave
them
their
instructions
might
have
been
mort
or
vince
suggested
wallie
it
might
have
been
yes
but
i
doubt
it
they
would
run
things
in
such
a
way
without
being
told
to
do
so
by
the
boss
of
the
outfit
you
mean
uncle
bryant
he
the
owner
of
this
ranch
and
all
the
different
brands
that
are
used
here
are
recorded
in
his
name
i
understand
that
he
is
the
type
to
let
someone
else
boss
anything
he
owns
wallie
mused
for
a
moment
but
bryant
ai
he
did
finish
his
remark
was
it
bryant
himself
who
helped
your
brother
escape
from
jail
last
night
in
red
oak
why
should
he
argued
the
other
he
the
one
that
turned
mort
over
to
the
law
he
turned
him
over
to
the
law
because
mort
was
a
murderer
and
yuma
knew
it
that
act
on
bryant
part
would
remove
him
from
suspicion
yet
someone
helped
mort
escape
wallie
said
all
this
is
sure
surprisin
news
to
me
stranger
i
know
just
what
to
think
about
it
i
telling
you
continued
the
lone
ranger
so
you
can
be
ready
to
tell
anything
you
know
when
the
law
men
come
law
men
yuma
is
bringing
them
he
also
bringing
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
bryant
cavendish
arrest
he
ca
be
arrested
on
suspicions
like
yours
no
law
man
would
jail
an
old
man
on
anything
as
flimsy
as
that
i
did
explain
said
the
masked
man
slowly
yuma
is
charging
bryant
with
attempted
murder
that
will
be
enough
to
jail
him
in
the
meantime
you
do
well
to
get
your
own
story
straight
me
you
stranger
faltered
wallie
i
i
do
know
anything
about
the
things
that
go
on
around
here
i
hardly
ever
here
myself
i
do
like
the
place
i
spend
as
much
time
in
red
oak
as
i
can
the
masked
man
gripped
the
other
upper
arm
he
was
a
little
bit
surprised
to
find
the
muscles
beneath
the
fine
shirt
hard
and
firm
not
flabby
as
wallie
disposition
and
habits
indicated
just
remember
this
he
said
the
mere
fact
that
men
like
sawtell
lonergan
rangoon
and
lombard
are
working
here
is
going
to
call
for
a
lot
of
explanation
every
one
of
those
four
has
a
substantial
reward
on
his
head
better
be
ready
to
tell
all
you
know
it
will
take
a
lot
from
you
to
convince
the
law
men
you
are
associated
with
this
gang
i
got
nothin
to
hide
said
wallie
i
tell
all
i
know
but
that
ai
much
vince
may
know
a
few
things
but
me
i
never
hang
around
the
basin
the
lone
ranger
nodded
very
well
then
but
remember
what
i
told
you
he
was
about
to
bryant
room
but
wallie
halted
him
what
do
you
want
asked
the
ranger
you
said
somethin
about
around
here
a
lot
of
cattle
has
been
stolen
from
ranches
around
this
part
of
the
country
the
masked
man
explained
the
means
that
had
been
used
to
rebrand
the
stolen
cattle
in
the
basin
give
the
burns
a
chance
to
heal
then
sell
the
stock
with
brands
that
suited
bills
of
sale
he
told
of
the
trail
down
thunder
mountain
that
had
been
used
for
shuttling
cattle
into
and
out
of
the
basin
wallie
seemed
genuinely
amazed
to
learn
that
things
of
this
sort
had
gone
on
beneath
his
unsuspecting
nose
you
plan
to
stay
here
until
the
law
men
come
is
that
it
asked
wallie
when
the
masked
man
finished
yes
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
bryant
perhaps
i
can
persuade
him
to
tell
all
he
knows
it
will
save
him
a
lot
of
trouble
to
talk
first
he
wo
talk
replied
wallie
i
do
know
about
that
i
never
knew
a
more
stubborn
man
in
my
life
no
amount
of
threatenin
could
loosen
his
tongue
he
put
up
with
all
the
torture
an
apache
could
concoct
an
never
say
a
word
nevertheless
he
not
a
fool
he
a
shrewd
man
and
his
whole
life
has
been
made
up
of
weighing
the
odds
then
playing
his
cards
i
have
a
hunch
that
he
realize
the
advantage
of
telling
all
he
can
why
if
he
does
he
be
in
no
position
to
compromise
with
the
law
and
he
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
jail
for
trying
to
murder
yuma
if
he
willing
to
talk
he
might
get
off
and
be
allowed
to
guide
the
future
of
his
niece
wallie
nodded
slowly
maybe
he
said
you
right
i
be
downstairs
to
see
that
those
crooks
do
get
out
of
the
vault
if
there
anything
you
want
just
holler
thanks
the
lone
ranger
returned
to
bryant
room
chapter
xxv
who
is
andrew
munson
the
masked
man
paused
at
the
door
until
he
heard
wallie
reach
the
first
floor
of
the
big
house
he
waited
another
moment
listening
intently
but
heard
nothing
he
wondered
where
the
men
were
whom
he
seen
approach
the
house
with
guns
drawn
and
what
they
were
doing
at
the
moment
then
he
closed
the
door
and
would
have
locked
it
but
he
found
no
key
bryant
cavendish
lay
on
the
bed
flat
on
his
back
his
mouth
was
and
his
eyes
were
closed
he
slept
noisily
breathing
with
a
throaty
sound
the
old
man
had
been
through
a
strenuous
ordeal
the
lone
ranger
stepped
to
the
bed
and
placed
sensitive
fingers
on
the
pulse
in
bryant
wrist
the
heartbeat
was
firm
and
steady
the
sleep
apparently
was
normal
sleep
brought
on
by
sheer
exhaustion
not
abnormal
unconsciousness
just
as
well
the
masked
man
muttered
if
he
stay
asleep
for
a
little
while
i
have
a
look
at
that
desk
the
desk
was
old
and
rather
battered
it
was
a
huge
affair
of
oak
with
many
drawers
beneath
the
top
rising
from
the
back
of
the
desk
there
was
a
section
divided
into
many
squares
filled
with
papers
as
these
pigeonholes
were
it
closely
resembled
an
overworked
post
office
the
sections
on
the
right
were
neatly
ordered
the
papers
folded
evenly
and
tucked
in
edgewise
the
masked
man
glanced
about
the
room
meticulous
order
was
apparent
everywhere
on
the
dresser
a
brush
comb
a
large
knife
and
a
smaller
knife
and
a
razor
were
neatly
arranged
a
shelf
above
the
washstand
held
a
shaving
mug
the
brush
instead
of
being
in
the
mug
in
sloppy
fashion
had
been
rinsed
and
stood
on
end
the
rest
of
the
room
was
equally
neat
the
ordered
compartments
of
the
desk
were
then
as
bryant
had
fixed
them
the
lefthand
pigeonholes
were
otherwise
papers
were
jammed
in
these
without
regard
for
order
some
were
folded
others
just
stuffed
in
some
compartments
bulged
while
others
were
barely
some
papers
were
on
edge
some
lay
flat
the
condition
of
things
told
a
story
of
a
search
that
had
been
started
at
the
extreme
left
and
continued
methodically
one
compartment
at
a
time
until
the
object
of
the
search
was
found
the
lone
ranger
reasoned
that
the
object
whatever
it
was
had
been
in
the
last
disordered
pigeonhole
he
glanced
at
bryant
and
found
him
still
asleep
and
snoring
he
pulled
papers
from
the
pigeonhole
and
spread
them
on
the
desk
top
a
few
receipts
of
recent
date
an
envelope
with
a
penciled
address
on
it
a
bill
of
sale
for
twenty
head
of
cattle
a
clipping
from
a
jo
paper
that
dealt
with
a
railroad
that
was
contemplated
in
the
west
a
pamphlet
which
described
in
glowing
terms
the
curative
qualities
of
doctor
blaine
golden
tonic
a
sheet
of
heavy
paper
folded
twice
across
and
labeled
bryant
cavendish
his
last
will
and
testament
the
lone
ranger
replaced
everything
else
then
drew
another
legal
document
from
the
pocket
of
his
shirt
he
unfolded
this
and
laid
it
by
the
will
the
writing
in
the
two
was
identical
lonergan
handwriting
the
masked
man
had
known
there
would
have
to
be
a
will
of
some
sort
to
accompany
the
agreement
which
the
natural
heirs
had
signed
forswearing
their
rights
to
the
cavendish
property
he
had
been
anxious
to
know
the
name
of
the
individual
chosen
as
heir
penelope
and
her
cousins
were
mentioned
in
the
will
each
was
to
receive
ten
dollars
in
cash
a
lawyer
foresight
had
doubtless
dictated
the
mention
of
them
so
that
there
would
be
no
complaint
that
bryant
had
forgotten
relatives
in
preparing
the
will
the
balance
of
the
estate
after
all
just
obligations
had
been
paid
was
to
go
to
a
man
named
andrew
munson
the
document
described
andrew
munson
as
a
man
to
whom
bryant
felt
a
heavy
obligation
it
told
how
munson
must
be
identified
and
omitted
no
detail
bryant
cavendish
had
signed
his
name
at
the
bottom
and
in
the
proper
places
there
were
signatures
of
witnesses
until
such
time
as
andrew
munson
could
be
found
the
basin
ranch
was
to
be
managed
by
bryant
four
nephews
or
if
all
four
were
not
alive
by
the
survivors
who
the
masked
man
asked
himself
is
andrew
munson
he
had
never
heard
the
name
before
there
might
be
some
reference
to
munson
in
the
papers
in
the
desk
but
the
search
through
these
would
have
to
wait
until
a
later
time
there
was
something
far
more
urgent
that
must
be
done
at
once
it
took
several
minutes
to
waken
old
bryant
cavendish
when
he
was
fully
awake
and
growling
his
complaints
at
being
roused
the
lone
ranger
sat
beside
him
on
the
bed
get
fully
awake
cavendish
he
said
bryant
squinted
in
the
light
that
came
from
the
windows
hurts
my
eyes
he
complained
in
a
somewhat
sleepy
voice
the
masked
man
crossed
the
room
and
drew
the
heavy
draperies
together
cutting
out
most
of
the
light
and
making
the
room
quite
dim
better
i
heard
your
voice
before
bryant
said
who
are
yuh
we
rode
from
red
oak
together
last
night
cavendish
i
was
with
you
in
a
cave
until

hell

here
an
lem

alone
where

the
masked
man
poured
water
from
the
pitcher
and
held
it
to
the
old
man
lips
while
he
explained
penelope
is
in
red
oak
she
went
there
this
morning
with
the
children
my
friend
the
indian
went
with
her
bryant
drank
half
the
water
then
pushed
the
cup
aside
he
rubbed
his
eyes
then
studied
the
masked
man
squinting
slightly
i
reckon
he
said
i
remember
things
now
so
damn
much
has
happened
in
the
past
couple
o
days
i
ca
somehow
keep
things
straight

the
old
man
in
a
nettled
voice
what

will
from
the
desk
i
want
you
to
take
a
look
at
it

light
in
here

see
it
i
do
need
tuh

it
i
know
what
in
it
examine
it
anyway
fer
what
see
if
it
just
the
way
you
want
it
i
got
fed
up
with
all
these
fool
stunts
of
yores
stranger
now
for
the
last
time
will
yuh
leave
me
be
the
lone
ranger
found
it
difficult
to
control
his
anger
before
him
sitting
upright
in
the
bed
was
the
man
who
was
indirectly
responsible
for
the
murder
of
those
texas
rangers
whose
graves
were
in
the
gap
for
becky
death
the
stabbing
of
gimlet
possibly
even
of
rangoon
and
mort
and
this
man
was
asking
to
be
left
alone
the
masked
clenched
fists
trembled
while
he
fought
for
he
must
above
all
keep
his
voice
down
he
leaned
forward
i
want
to
know
he
said
softly
as
he
put
the
will
in
his
pocket
who
andrew
munson
is
bryant
said
who
the
lone
ranger
repeated
the
name
cavendish
pondered
his
eyes
held
a
faraway
expression
as
he
gazed
at
a
corner
of
the
ceiling
answer
me
cavendish
who
is
andrew
munson
bryant
turned
slowly
and
looked
at
the
mask
his
frown
was
deep
and
his
voice
without
emotion
i
never
heard
the
name
before
the
lone
ranger
felt
something
in
him
snap
it
seemed
as
if
this
stubbornness
in
bryant
was
more
than
he
could
bear
without
an
outburst
the
strain
of
the
past
few
days
the
fight
against
his
wounds
against
fatigue
and
pain
the
bitterness
of
seeing
good
friends
die
all
of
these
things
seemed
to
roll
together
in
a
choking
bitter
mass
that
made
him
speechless
his
hands
reached
out
and
gripped
cavendish
you
he
whispered
in
a
hoarse
tense
voice
must
be
shown
with
strength
born
of
desperation
the
lone
ranger
lifted
bryant
as
if
he
weighed
nothing
and
hauled
him
from
the
bed
his
unanswered
question
was
ringing
in
his
brain
who
is
andrew
munson
chapter
xxvi
disaster
gets
organized
as
wallie
descended
the
stairs
after
this
talk
with
the
masked
man
his
nonchalance
crystallized
into
a
grim
resolve
that
transformed
his
personality
he
paused
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
and
glanced
up
the
enigmatic
man
with
the
mask
apparently
had
returned
to
bryant
bedroom
then
wallie
opened
the
front
door
and
stepped
to
the
verandah
half
a
dozen
of
the
ranch
hands
were
there
with
curiosity
wallie
spoke
softly
but
without
a
trace
of
the
careless
ease
that
marked
his
style
at
other
times
go
back
to
whatever
you
were
doin
he
ordered
if
you
needed
we
send
for
you
but
who
was
that
masked
man
with
bryant
asked
one
of
the
men
none
of
your
damn
business
retorted
wallie
in
a
surly
voice
get
to
work
an
you
be
sent
for
later
he
turned
to
another
man
has
gimlet
been
buried
yet
the
lanky
individual
addressed
shook
his
head
slowly
we
jest
tossed
a
blanket
over
him
he
said
we
war
shore
what
yore
plans
was
still
in
the
bunkhouse
wallie
nodded
leave
him
there
for
the
time
being
he
swung
through
the
door
and
headed
for
the
upset
living
room
had
penelope
seen
wallie
in
his
present
mood
she
would
have
revised
her
opinion
of
him
in
a
hundred
ways
he
walked
with
a
purposeful
air
instead
of
the
familiar
sauntering
gait
his
eyes
generally
in
boredom
were
wide
and
divided
by
a
perpendicular
on
his
forehead
and
those
eyes
were
hard
his
hands
were
clenched
with
such
intensity
that
the
fingernails
bit
into
the
palms
hard
fists
in
place
of
hands
that
strummed
soft
tunes
of
romance
on
a
guitar
the
soft
mouth
was
gone
and
in
its
place
there
was
the
same
hard
line
that
bryant
cavendish
showed
when
angry
wallie
was
indeed
a
different
person
a
fop
no
longer
instead
a
man
of
purpose
with
cruel
ruthlessness
in
every
feature
he
went
through
the
living
room
without
a
pause
and
halted
only
when
he
reached
the
kitchen
he
closed
the
door
without
a
slam
jeb
sat
with
a
woebegone
expression
on
a
heavy
chair
sawtell
as
bland
as
ever
stood
beside
him
holding
a
heavy
gun
in
one
hand
at
the
sight
of
wallie
sawtell
spoke
he
started
to
make
some
complaints
a
little
while
ago
an
i
tapped
him
on
the
head
i
do
think
we
hear
any
more
from
him
wallie
glanced
at
his
lean
brother
there
was
a
cut
somewhere
beneath
the
stringy
hair
on
the
left
side
of
jeb
skull
blood
seeping
from
it
had
dribbled
down
his
cheek
and
stained
his
collar
jeb
eyes
held
an
unvoiced
but
pathetic
plea
they
resembled
those
of
a
calf
suffering
the
torment
of
a
branding
iron
wallie
said
better
gag
an
tie
him
i
decide
later
what
to
be
done
sawtell
nodded
dropped
his
pistol
in
a
holster
and
proceeded
with
the
tying
while
jeb
who
knew
that
a
voiced
complaint
would
simply
mean
another
crack
on
the
head
made
no
resistance
lonergan
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
kitchen
table
casually
working
on
his
fingernails
with
a
carving
knife
he
glanced
up
a
question
mark
in
his
expression
there
had
been
two
others
locked
in
the
vault
beneath
the
living
room
they
too
were
present
in
the
kitchen
lombard
and
vince
sullen
and
dripping
muttered
curses
as
well
as
sweat
stood
side
by
side
leaning
against
the
wall
with
whisky
glasses
in
their
hands
are
you
sure
began
wallie
none
of
you
knows
who
that
masked
man
is
he
glanced
from
one
to
another
receiving
negative
headshakes
all
i
know
about
him
grumbled
lombard
is
that
i
spent
a
hell
of
a
night
in
that
damned
wet
cellar
an
i
goin
to
square
it
with
him
what
about
me
snapped
vince
my
joints
ache
fer
a
week
after
night
you
said
wallie
looking
at
lombard
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
an
make
sure
he
do
come
out
of
bryant
room
vince
you
get
close
to
the
window
an
keep
watch
on
the
gap
yuma
will
be
here
some
time
today
with
a
warrant
for
bryant
arrest
an
law
men
to
act
on
the
warrant
why
me
what
the
matter
with
sawtell
or
lonergan
wallie
did
reply
but
his
gaze
was
quite
enough
vince
grumbled
his
way
to
the
window
as
if
he
resented
being
ordered
about
by
his
own
brother
in
the
same
fashion
that
ordinary
outlaws
were
commanded
he
dragged
a
chair
to
the
window
and
sat
down
this
do
for
the
time
sawtell
suggested
as
he
tied
the
last
knot
in
the
ropes
about
jeb
arms
now
what
we
do
with
him
leave
him
where
he
is
until
i
finish
speaking
and
then
we
decide
later
what
we
do
with
him
i
told
you
that
already
he
knows
too
damn
much
said
vince
an
he
too
dumb
to
be
any
good
to
us
why
worry
about
him
who
said
wallie
is
worrying
what
about
that
masked
man
what
was
it
you
said
about
yuma
comin
with
the
law
it
was
lonergan
the
speaking
wallie
explained
briefly
how
yuma
hat
had
been
shot
at
by
bryant
how
both
yuma
and
the
man
with
the
mask
were
convinced
that
bryant
cavendish
was
the
leader
of
all
that
went
on
in
the
basin
that
works
out
fine
for
us
he
said
we
may
have
to
lay
low
for
a
little
while
but
we
been
needin
a
rest
anyhow
we
sell
off
some
of
the
cattle
we
got
here
now
but
wait
till
things
cool
off
before
we
bring
in
any
more
he
went
into
detail
explaining
how
the
masked
man
plan
was
to
persuade
bryant
to
confess
before
he
went
to
jail
and
he
figures
he
continued
on
lettin
the
law
take
you
men
back
sawtell
shifted
his
weight
uneasily
and
lonergan
laid
down
the
carving
knife
there
a
rope
just
a
little
too
tight
for
my
neck
waitin
for
me
if
i
go
back
to
red
oak
sawtell
said
none
of
you
are
goin
back
snapped
wallie
did
i
tell
you
when
i
suggested
that
you
come
here
and
help
me
out
that
i
see
you
well
protected
maybe
suggested
lonergan
you
got
some
new
scheme
i
have
it
better
be
good
your
idea
was
working
out
swell
until
rebecca
sent
for
the
law
then
instead
of
entertaining
those
texas
rangers
and
convincing
them
that
everything
was
all
right
here
you
had
to
ambush
them
as
a
lawyer
i
advised
against
that
massacre
i
did
ask
for
your
advice
lonergan
well
it
was
a
mistake
to
them
anyway
that
wo
stop
other
rangers
from
coming
here
to
see
what
happened
to
them
i
tell
you
wallie
there
a
great
big
rope
speaking
in
the
picturesque
way
of
the
around
all
of
us
an
that
rope
is
bein
hauled
in
tight
like
hell
it
is
barked
wallie
in
a
sharp
reply
if
you
button
your
lip
for
a
few
minutes
i
tell
you
how
everything
has
worked
out
to
put
us
in
the
clear
you
were
satisfied
with
that
massacre
the
lawyer
went
on
accusingly
you
had
to
kill
rangoon
then
gimlet
and
last
night
mort
my
policy
replied
wallie
his
voice
cold
with
suppressed
anger
is
to
leave
no
loose
ends
rangoon
could
be
relied
on
gimlet
already
knew
a
few
things
an
thought
a
lot
more
mort
would
have
squealed
his
yellow
head
off
to
avoid
bein
hanged
as
for
yuma
it
a
damned
shame
he
did
get
a
couple
of
slugs
where
they
do
the
most
good
for
us
i
do
know
why
he
was
hired
to
work
here
anyway
said
lonergan
he
was
like
the
rest
of
the
men
bryant
himself
hired
yuma
an
god
knows
why
anyway
it
the
fact
that
yuma
is
bringin
the
law
that
put
us
in
the
clear
in
the
clear
on
what
asked
lonergan
i
do
know
why
in
hell
i
take
so
much
back
talk
from
you
lonergan
said
wallie
i
do
it
because
you
would
have
a
ghost
of
a
show
in
handling
things
after
bryant
dies
without
my
legal
talents
the
lawyer
studied
his
fingernails
with
exaggerated
concern
and
again
picked
up
the
carving
knife
now
what
is
this
big
scheme
of
yours
that
to
put
us
in
the
clear
my
own
suggestion
would
be
to
go
to
bryant
room
and
get
the
drop
on
this
masked
man
then
i
do
the
talking
from
now
on
wallie
interrupted
in
the
first
place
there
the
murder
of
rangoon
to
be
accounted
for
well
that
masked
man
and
the
indian
friend
that
went
to
town
with
penny
were
both
in
the
clearing
all
right
we
blame
rangoon
death
on
them
as
for
gimlet
yuma
had
a
lot
better
chance
to
kill
him
than
i
did
it
known
that
yuma
was
on
the
ranch
at
the
time
but
no
one
knows
that
i
came
back
from
red
oak
by
the
thunder
mountain
route
knifed
gimlet
an
went
back
to
town
we
tell
the
law
men
it
yuma
who
killed
gimlet
accuse
him
of
it
when
he
gets
here
and
let
him
try
to
deny
it
penny
herself
if
need
be
will
have
to
say
that
yuma
was
here
at
the
time
lonergan
nodded
so
far
he
said
you
doin
good
go
on
as
for
mort
death
hell
that
easy
to
blame
on
the
masked
man
everyone
in
red
oak
has
already
accused
him
of
murderin
mort
everyone
in
town
heard
him
yell
to
that
white
horse
of
his
when
he
carried
bryant
away
why
public
sentiment
is
with
us
there
ai
anyone
in
town
that
would
blame
the
masked
man
for
killing
not
only
mort
but
bryant
as
well
it
sounds
swell
to
me
admired
sawtell
all
but
for
the
fact
that
this
masked
man
an
bryant
are
both
upstairs
and
livin
that
a
detail
that
goin
to
be
taken
care
of
pronto
stated
wallie
my
story
which
vince
will
back
up
being
that
none
of
you
others
dare
show
yourselves
is
that
the
masked
man
brought
bryant
here
dead
i
shot
him
for
it
after
a
hell
of
a
fight
wallie
looked
proudly
at
lonergan
now
what
the
matter
with
that
lonergan
pondered
and
then
said
those
two
are
still
alive
that
the
only
trouble
it
wo
take
long
to
remedy
that
we
go
up
to
bryant
room
burst
in
and
start
shootin
get
bryant
and
get
the
masked
man
i
took
the
trouble
to
bring
the
key
with
me
so
the
door
wo
be
locked
by
lookin
through
the
keyhole
i
make
sure
where
the
two
of
them
are
an
then
when
we
go
into
the
room
we
wo
be
shootin
blind
we
miss
the
more
i
hear
about
it
said
sawtell
the
better
it
sounds
be
a
big
relief
to
have
bryant
out
of
our
way
for
keeps
he
been
a
nuisance
around
here
we
had
to
let
him
live
until
we
had
things
arranged
explained
wallie
but
now
there
no
more
need
of
him
it
not
only
get
rid
of
bryant
added
sawtell
it
clear
up
the
murders
around
here
i
suppose
you
got
some
way
all
worked
out
to
blame
the
killin
of
those
texas
rangers
on
him
the
masked
man
will
be
blamed
for
those
it
well
known
that
he
that
indian
are
pards
their
footprints
are
both
up
there
on
thunder
mountain
where
the
buzzards
are
cleanin
off
rangoon
bones
the
indian
footprints
are
near
the
graves
of
the
rangers
any
law
man
could
put
an
two
together
an
get
the
answer
that
the
masked
man
indian
killed
if
the
redskin
tries
to
deny
it
who
listen
to
him
against
the
evidence
lonergan
laid
down
the
knife
methodically
and
slid
from
the
edge
of
the
table
to
his
feet
wallie
looked
at
him
defiantly
as
if
daring
the
lawyer
to
find
a
flaw
in
the
plans
there
was
a
mixture
of
surprise
and
admiration
in
the
way
lonergan
looked
at
wallie
i
did
think
he
said
you
had
it
in
you
damned
if
it
wo
work
wallie
respect
for
the
adroit
brain
of
the
lawyer
made
him
glow
with
pleasure
at
a
compliment
from
that
man
as
i
see
it
said
lonergan
there
just
one
little
flaw
in
the
plans
what
that
demanded
wallie
the
story
you
figure
on
telling
wo
account
for
a
lot
of
bullet
holes
around
that
bedroom
of
your
uncle
have
you
got
a
way
around
that
worked
out
of
course
we
tell
the
law
that
bryant
was
shot
in
front
of
the
house
and
that
i
shot
the
masked
man
for
it
in
the
same
place
both
corpses
will
be
on
the
porch
an
there
wo
be
any
reason
to
go
into
the
bedroom
until
after
we
have
the
chance
to
clean
it
up
that
said
lonergan
will
do
it
i
had
a
hunch
contributed
vince
from
his
post
at
the
window
that
bryant
been
suspectin
things
for
some
time
i
be
damned
glad
to
see
him
done
away
with
with
him
an
penny
out
of
here
we
wo
have
to
be
so
damned
careful
about
every
move
we
make
wallie
nodded
after
the
law
is
satisfied
he
said
we
go
on
just
as
we
have
been
vince
will
take
charge
of
things
while
i
around
red
oak
an
playin
the
part
of
a
romeo
while
i
listen
for
news
about
cattle
ranches
that
are
just
invitin
visitors
like
us
the
leader
of
the
group
sketched
a
few
details
of
his
plan
then
said
i
want
all
of
you
to
go
upstairs
with
me
keep
your
guns
drawn
an
keep
still
we
take
lombard
as
we
go
by
him
when
the
fireworks
are
over
with
me
an
vince
will
wait
for
yuma
to
fetch
the
law
men
an
the
rest
of
you
can
hide
now
put
jeb
down
in
the
vault
then
fix
the
room
up
as
it
should
be
while
you
doin
that
i
tell
lombard
the
plans
an
then
we
all
go
up
to
bryant
room
jeb
was
still
dazed
from
the
ugly
blow
sawtell
had
given
him
he
was
limp
and
unresisting
as
the
men
picked
him
up
bodily
hands
and
feet
tied
tightly
and
carried
him
to
the
living
room
they
dropped
him
on
the
floor
and
replaced
things
where
they
belonged
sawtell
tossed
the
hunk
of
firewood
to
one
side
then
handed
down
the
chair
from
its
place
on
the
table
top
lonergan
kicked
the
chair
toward
a
wall
while
sawtell
stepped
to
the
floor
and
hauled
away
the
table
it
was
vince
who
opened
the
trapdoor
then
rolled
his
brother
jeb
into
the
opening
he
laughed
as
he
heard
jeb
body
strike
the
floor
below
do
get
intuh
no
mischief
down
there
he
called
then
he
closed
the
door
and
pulled
the
rug
in
place
to
conceal
it
meanwhile
wallie
was
with
lombard
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
lombard
was
grinning
and
nodded
as
the
others
joined
the
couple
he
drew
his
gun
and
spun
the
cylinder
to
check
it
a
moment
later
after
a
few
last
whispered
instructions
from
wallie
the
five
were
ready
to
go
upstairs
with
disaster
for
the
lone
ranger
chapter
xxvii
guns
talk
back
the
quintet
went
up
the
stairs
like
indians
stalking
single
file
through
wooded
land
each
man
carried
his
gun
in
his
left
hand
and
braced
himself
with
his
right
against
the
wall
they
stayed
as
close
to
that
wall
as
possible
to
minimize
the
creaking
of
the
stairs
the
only
sound
was
a
faint
leathery
whisper
from
the
dusty
boots
wallie
cursed
inwardly
at
his
lack
of
foresight
in
not
having
his
men
go
to
the
double
murder
wallie
was
in
the
lead
vince
in
the
rear
in
this
order
they
gained
the
upstairs
hall
any
apprehensions
wallie
might
have
had
about
the
squeaking
boots
were
dispelled
as
he
drew
close
to
bryant
door
a
resonant
voice
undoubtedly
that
of
the
masked
man
was
speaking
wallie
felt
no
qualms
of
guilt
or
conscience
at
the
ruthlessness
of
his
plans
he
had
the
slightest
intention
of
giving
the
men
who
were
marked
for
execution
a
chance
to
defend
themselves
the
code
of
western
fair
play
was
missing
from
wallie
personality
this
was
to
be
no
duel
but
simply
the
extinction
of
two
men
whose
deaths
had
become
essential
to
his
plans
wallie
halted
at
the
closed
but
unlocked
door
and
motioned
lonergan
and
lombard
past
him
as
the
leader
faced
the
door
those
two
were
on
his
left
while
vince
and
sawtell
guns
now
shifted
to
their
right
hands
stood
upon
his
right
all
but
wallie
were
balanced
on
the
balls
of
their
feet
tense
and
ready
to
charge
through
the
door
but
wallie
hesitated
he
could
hear
the
masked
man
voice
with
a
vibrant
quality
carrying
through
the
door
he
could
hear
distinctly
each
word
that
was
said
the
masked
man
was
scolding
old
bryant
cavendish
wallie
crouched
and
placed
one
eye
close
to
the
keyhole
the
room
he
saw
was
dimly
lighted
it
was
difficult
to
see
details
the
blankets
were
mounded
on
the
bed
as
if
they
been
pulled
over
bryant
big
body
on
the
far
side
of
the
bed
wallie
could
make
out
a
white
sombrero
and
judged
that
to
be
where
the
masked
man
sat
while
he
conducted
the
conversation
wallie
now
knew
just
where
he
should
direct
his
men
to
fire
when
he
threw
open
the
door
he
hesitated
listening
to
what
was
being
said
inside
you
the
most
unreasonably
stubborn
old
fool
i
ever
known
cavendish
it
was
the
masked
man
speaking
it
high
time
for
you
to
drop
this
false
pride
of
yours
admit
you
grown
old
let
someone
help
you
cavendish
all
these
murders
are
yours
i
know
you
are
the
killer
personally
but
none
of
them
could
possibly
have
happened
if
you
been
so
foolishly
stubborn
you
never
admit
that
you
found
it
hard
to
walk
you
thought
you
hid
that
fact
but
you
did
you
did
fool
anyone
at
all
then
when
your
eyes
began
to
fail
you
you
tried
to
hide
that
fact
too
why
right
now
you
so
nearly
blind
that
you
have
to
your
way
wallie
heard
a
response
from
his
uncle
then
the
masked
man
continued
all
of
those
nephews
of
yours
realized
that
you
not
only
were
incapable
of
getting
about
but
that
you
could
even
see
what
went
on
they
felt
secure
in
doing
whatever
they
pleased
so
they
organized
a
regular
crime
ring
here
in
the
basin
they
replaced
all
of
your
former
hands
with
crooks
whom
they
selected
they
let
it
be
known
in
the
right
places
that
this
basin
would
be
a
safe
hideout
for
men
the
law
was
looking
for
you
could
see
what
your
cowhands
looked
like
so
you
had
no
cause
to
distrust
them
you
would
go
to
a
doctor
and
have
your
eyes
treated
and
your
sight
improved
because
you
wanted
to
conceal
your
condition
wallie
reasoned
that
inasmuch
as
neither
of
the
two
beyond
the
door
was
to
survive
much
longer
he
might
as
well
hear
what
else
this
incalculable
masked
man
knew
penelope
tried
her
best
to
find
reasons
for
your
unconcern
over
the
ways
things
were
going
here
she
thought
more
of
you
than
you
deserved
she
tried
to
convince
herself
that
you
were
not
aware
of
things
and
tried
to
find
out
if
blindness
was
the
reason
she
defended
you
when
yuma
turned
against
you
and
what
was
her
reward
for
that
loyalty
you
turned
against
her
the
same
as
you
did
against
those
graceless
cousins
she
was
made
to
sign
away
her
rights
just
as
they
were
do
interrupt
cavendish
i
more
to
say
yuma
felt
that
as
long
as
you
were
alive
that
girl
would
be
guarded
and
protected
how
wrong
he
was
but
that
was
what
he
thought
and
when
i
captured
him
he
tried
to
convince
me
that
he
was
the
leader
of
these
basin
killers
he
was
ready
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
as
a
fugitive
in
hiding
and
keep
the
law
off
your
neck
when
i
showed
him
the
document
that
penelope
had
been
made
to
sign
he
realized
that
he
made
a
mistake
he
saw
then
that
the
girl
he
loved
could
look
for
little
enough
happiness
or
security
through
you
who
in
the
name
of
heaven
is
this
andrew
munson
what
do
you
owe
him
that
you
deprive
penelope
of
any
future
comfort
in
his
favor
wallie
strained
to
hear
what
bryant
reply
would
be
but
there
was
none
in
the
brief
pause
he
heard
the
heavy
emotional
breathing
of
the
masked
man
it
was
until
this
morning
that
i
learned
some
truths
the
masked
man
continued
i
knew
that
someone
had
slipped
into
this
basin
and
murdered
gimlet
because
the
killer
rode
within
ten
yards
of
me
but
i
did
know
who
he
was
tonto
was
halfway
up
thunder
mountain
when
this
same
man
went
by
it
was
too
dark
there
for
the
indian
to
identify
him
when
he
killed
rangoon
then
he
went
on
to
red
oak
where
he
let
mort
out
of
jail
with
instructions
to
kill
you
in
your
hotel
room
you
know
what
happened
there
i
told
you
how
i
shot
him
in
the
leg
and
how
he
was
later
stabbed
to
death
since
then
i
learned
the
killer
i
told
you
about
tonto
he
was
here
waiting
for
the
riders
to
come
back
from
red
oak
the
trail
from
red
oak
is
on
hard
ground
as
you
know
the
trail
over
thunder
mountain
is
marshy
in
a
lot
of
places
the
loam
there
is
soft
and
black
and
different
from
anything
that
could
be
found
on
the
trail
through
the
gap
well
tonto
watched
when
each
horse
came
into
the
corral
he
found
one
just
one
horse
cavendish
that
had
black
loam
caked
to
the
fetlocks
he
gave
me
the
name
of
the
man
who
rode
and
owned
that
horse
in
a
note
which
he
left
at
the
cave
man
is
your
nephew
wallie
wallie
listening
frowned
heavily
and
thanked
his
lucky
stars
that
this
man
with
such
a
keen
and
logical
mind
was
to
be
killed
he
would
prove
a
dangerous
adversary
if
left
alive
you
do
believe
me
the
masked
man
said
you
wo
let
yourself
believe
or
trust
anyone
but
i
wallie
is
what
i
told
you
if
i
can
prove
that
will
you
talk
wallie
had
heard
enough
come
on
he
cried
and
threw
the
door
wide
open
lombard
and
sawtell
plunged
into
the
room
and
dropped
to
one
knee
while
they
opened
fire
lonergan
and
vince
were
close
behind
firing
over
them
while
wallie
remained
in
back
guns
crashed
deafeningly
in
the
confines
of
the
room
the
white
hat
near
the
bed
became
a
thing
alive
leaping
across
the
room
in
crazy
circles
the
mound
of
blankets
on
the
bed
became
a
shaking
mass
as
bullet
after
bullet
bored
deep
a
score
of
shots
roared
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
then
back
talk
in
the
voices
of
came
from
a
corner
of
the
room
sawtell
gun
jumped
from
his
hand
as
if
by
magic
his
fingers
were
suddenly
a
bloody
mass
at
which
the
killer
stared
in
stupefaction
more
flames
lanced
from
the
corner
and
lombard
extended
gun
arm
snapped
as
a
slug
tore
through
flesh
and
bone
between
the
wrist
and
elbow
sawtell
felt
no
pain
in
the
heat
of
battle
instinctive
gunman
that
he
was
he
fell
flat
upon
his
belly
jerking
out
a
second
revolver
with
his
left
hand
loud
snarls
and
curses
came
from
lombard
while
sawtell
took
careful
aim
he
steadied
his
weapon
at
a
point
directly
between
the
eyeslits
of
the
mask
his
finger
tensed
upon
the
trigger
then
suddenly
his
arm
dropped
his
gun
unfired
he
went
limp
and
slumped
in
his
forehead
there
was
a
tiny
hole
but
the
back
of
his
head
was
an
awful
sight
where
a
bullet
had
gouged
out
his
skull
bryant
cavendish
fired
at
sounds
with
an
instinct
that
was
supersensitive
somehow
the
old
man
had
found
one
of
his
guns
and
cried
aloud
in
savage
hate
as
he
rocketed
shot
after
shot
toward
the
doorway
they
all
me
he
cried
out
i
show
i
do
need
sight
i
can
locate
skunks
by
smell
his
gun
whammed
again
and
death
spat
at
the
doorway
wallie
screamed
his
orders
in
the
corner
shoot
drill
he
pushed
from
behind
at
the
instant
that
the
lawyer
lonergan
took
a
bullet
from
the
masked
man
gun
on
the
hand
and
one
from
bryant
big
revolver
in
the
belly
he
pitched
forward
and
fell
across
the
writhing
form
of
lombard
shrill
yells
and
cries
of
pain
rose
far
above
livid
curses
the
lone
ranger
snatched
the
gun
from
bryant
hand
no
more
shooting
he
cried
he
leaped
toward
the
doorway
head
low
and
charged
vince
had
swung
to
face
the
surprise
counterattack
his
gun
blazed
but
the
lone
ranger
was
beneath
the
slug
he
crashed
into
vince
with
such
force
that
the
runty
killer
was
fairly
lifted
off
his
feet
and
tossed
across
the
room
while
his
gun
was
jarred
out
of
his
hand
wallie
knowing
his
life
depended
on
the
fight
scrambled
up
from
the
floor
the
thought
of
losing
made
him
frantic
as
he
swung
his
empty
gun
in
a
vicious
blow
at
the
lone
ranger
the
blow
struck
the
lone
ranger
on
the
bandaged
shoulder
a
sudden
stab
of
pain
like
a
iron
gripped
his
side
as
wallie
followed
up
his
advantage
still
clutching
the
heavy
revolver
he
rammed
it
muzzle
first
into
the
masked
chest
the
lone
ranger
could
breathe
the
blow
must
have
broken
at
least
one
rib
possibly
more
he
felt
his
legs
caving
beneath
him
while
his
brain
fought
valiantly
against
the
dizziness
that
threatened
to
engulf
him
he
threw
both
arms
about
wallie
and
locked
his
hands
behind
his
neck
he
was
falling
and
helpless
to
prevent
it
he
was
barely
conscious
of
the
fact
that
wallie
kept
driving
more
blows
to
his
stomach
blows
that
were
too
short
to
have
much
power
behind
them
close
to
his
ear
he
heard
the
other
voice
as
a
meaningless
jumble
of
hissing
syllables
somehow
the
lone
ranger
weight
threw
wallie
off
his
balance
too
the
masked
man
had
the
fighter
heart
that
dictates
action
after
the
mind
has
ceased
functioning
a
mighty
heave
a
wrench
that
split
the
wound
wide
open
still
falling
it
seemed
that
time
stood
still
and
split
seconds
were
like
hours
and
then
a
crash
the
masked
man
fall
was
padded
by
the
body
of
the
man
he
fell
on
his
superhuman
effort
had
thrown
wallie
beneath
him
as
the
two
went
down
wallie
head
smacked
hard
against
the
floor
now
vince
had
a
gun
was
on
his
feet
and
coming
close
his
ugly
face
looked
like
a
leering
demon
as
he
raised
his
gun
the
lone
ranger
rolled
and
as
he
did
so
drew
his
extra
weapon
two
guns
spoke
as
one
their
muzzles
so
close
that
the
flames
were
intermingled
to
the
lone
ranger
close
to
acrid
fumes
and
scorching
flame
it
seemed
that
hell
had
burst
into
the
room
and
then
oblivion
chapter

wallie
leads
an
ace
another
gun
with
six
slugs
that
blast
yer
brains
clean
outen
the
back
of
yer
blasted
head
if
yuh
so
much
as
make
a
move
these
were
the
first
words
the
lone
ranger
heard
as
he
recovered
consciousness
his
body
was
a
mass
of
pain
and
each
breath
brought
a
stabbing
sensation
in
his
chest
he
realized
but
dimly
that
bryant
cavendish
was
speaking
he
did
know
to
whom
yer
stayin
right
here
till
yuma
had
aplenty
o
time
tuh
git
here
with
the
law
an
if
he
ai
come
by
sundown
i
blastin
the
hell
out
of
yuh
anyhow
obviously
bryant
had
the
situation
well
in
hand
the
masked
man
edged
painfully
to
one
side
and
tried
to
focus
his
eyes
on
the
scene
about
him
the
bedroom
air
was
heavy
with
the
smoke
of
gunfire
and
the
light
was
dim
the
floor
resembled
a
battlefield
wallie
lay
where
he
had
fallen
still
unconscious
a
pool
of
red
surrounded
sawtell
lifeless
body
lonergan
rolled
upon
the
floor
clutching
his
stomach
and
moaning
hideously
the
lawyer
was
dying
that
was
obvious
but
dying
in
the
most
horrible
and
painful
way
a
man
can
die
by
bullets
lombard
sat
in
a
chair
his
right
arm
hanging
limp
and
dripping
red
his
face
was
drawn
with
pain
but
he
was
silent
vince
alone
seemed
to
have
escaped
lightly
he
had
a
handkerchief
a
dirty
blue
one
wrapped
about
one
hand
but
this
prevent
his
holding
both
hands
above
his
shoulders
the
masked
man
struggled
to
his
feet
and
almost
staggered
his
way
to
the
washstand
he
somehow
managed
to
splash
water
from
a
pitcher
to
the
basin
then
scooped
handfuls
of
it
to
his
face
yuh
all
right
bryant
cavendish
demanded
i
i
all
right
i
do
know
just
why
i
i
thought
save
yer
breath
till
yuh
got
enough
of
it

enough
tuh
keep
these
skunks
covered
yuh
shot
vince
gun
outen
his
hand
i
thought
fer
sure
you
was
a
goner
the
lone
ranger
heard
a
soft
moan
and
turned
to
see
wallie
recovering
from
the
blow
he
sustained
when
his
head
struck
the
floor
still
unsteady
on
his
feet
the
masked
man
carried
water
in
the
cup
and
threw
it
on
the
other
face
then
he
joined
bryant
cavendish
after
regaining
his
guns
he
sat
on
the
floor
and
reloaded
for
the
first
time
he
was
aware
of
the
freshly
opened
shoulder
wound
the
blood
was
soaking
through
his
shirt
his
chest
too
bothered
him
but
there
were
other
things
of
far
greater
importance
than
his
personal
condition
wallie
was
sitting
up
with
a
dazed
look
in
his
face
you
barked
bryant
git
over
there
an
stand
close
tuh
vince
wallie
obeyed
slowly
meanwhile
lonergan
had
ceased
his
cries
the
lone
ranger
knew
by
looking
at
him
that
the
man
was
dead
then
he
heard
bryant
scolding
i
had
two
guns
the
old
man
complained
i

without

a
hell
of
a
lot
of
suspicion
so
they
put

name
of
munson
if
yuh
want
my
opinion
there
ai
an
never
was
no
andrew
munson
that
said
the
lone
ranger
is
about
the
way
they
planned
it
they
knew
the
claimant
to
the
basin
would
never
appear
and
they
go
on
running
the
place
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
will
and
using
it
as
they
have
been
for
the
past
weeks
in
their
cattle
business
wallie
yawned
in
feigned
boredom
when
you
get
through
with
all
this
talk
you
better
spend
a
little
time
deciding
whether
you
want
penelope
to
live
or
die
the
lone
ranger
said
there
one
more
thing
we
have
learned
his
voice
grew
flinty
who
was
in
the
party
that
ambushed
those
texas
rangers
what
the
difference
answer
me
an
if
i
do
replied
wallie
in
a
bantering
tone
the
masked
man
stepped
back
a
pace
and
drew
his
gun
he
held
it
at
a
hip
the
muzzle
pointing
at
the
stomach
of
the
other
you
saw
how
lonergan
died
he
said
softly
it
was
easy
to
watch
wallie
glanced
at
the
gun
then
at
the
masked
man
face
he
saw
something
in
those
steady
eyes
behind
the
mask
that
made
him
almost
feel
the
frightful
drilling
of
a
slug
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
i
i
know
anything
about
it
he
said
mort
an
vince
planned
it
by
themselves
an
yuh
damned
squealer
yelled

a
confession

shouted
wallie
you

gain
by
us

just

that
penelope

too
you
do
understand
one
of
the
windows
in
the
room
looked
out
across
the
basin
to
the
gap
the
masked
man
had
glanced
toward
this
frequently
throughout
the
conversation
now
he
saw
horsemen
coming
from
the
canyon
yuma
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
he
said
he
crossing
the
basin
now
then
you

to
make
your
mind
up
quick
hoofs
clattered
outside
the
house
wallie
glanced
through
the
window
and
saw
a
score
of
horsemen
coming
close
with
yuma
in
the
lead
quick
he
cried
it
us
or

bryant
raged
and
stormed
his
fury
broke
all
past
attainments
the
louder
the
old
man
shouted
the
more
he
said
the
more
poised
wallie
became
during
the
furor
the
lone
ranger
made
no
comment
the
hoofs
clattered
in
halting
and
men
voices
carried
to
the
room
the
lone
ranger
saw
with
satisfaction
that
the
men
with
yuma
were
not
deputies
like
slim
they
were
grim
texas
rangers
and
they
lost
no
time
in
herding
the
men
of
the
basin
into
a
group
with
hands
upraised
a
door
was
opened
downstairs
and
heavy
boots
clattered
on
the
stairs
bryant
cavendish
sweat
dripping
from
his
face
looked
beaten
he
cast
an
appealing
glance
toward
the
masked
man
i
he
said
do
have

the
masked
man
replied
stepping
back
against
the
wall
there
was
a
hurried
conversation
in
the
hall
then
yuma
came
in
his
face

red
and
sweaty
his
eyes
went
wide
with
surprise
at
the
scene
before

the
masked
man
softly
yuma
slapped
it
closed
and
then
exclaimed

the

yuma
nodded
still
he
looked
from
bryant
to
wallie

at

men
on

said

the
hell

there
something
more
important
wallie
was
just
trying
to
buy
his
freedom
he
had
penelope
taken
to
breed
martin
in
red
oak
breed
martin
howled
yuma
following
the
name
with
a
string
of
invectives
why
that
wallie
said
that
breed
was
to
take
the
girl
to
a
hiding
place
and
if
he
did
hear
from
wallie
to
go
on
to
mexico
with
her
yuma
face
lost
color
his
eyes
flashed
angry
fire
in
a
look
toward
the
erstwhile
bandit
leader
an
so
he
wants
tuh
be
let
go
free
said
yuma
with
terrible
coldness
in
his
voice
where
is
this
hidin
place
wallie
spoke
think
i
fool
enough
to
tell
you
not
me

said
yuma
slowly
yore
agoin
tuh
tell
where
at
that
place
is
he
took
one
step
forward
swinging
his
right
hand
in
a
wide
arc
it
landed
with
a
resounding
slap
on
wallie
cheek
that
cried
yuma
ai
even
the
start
he
brought
his
left
around
to
slap
the
other
side
of
wallie
face
and
then
began
a
dazzling
sequence
of
slaps
each
one
delivered
with
a
force
that
bounced
head
from
one
side
to
the
other
a
blow
with
a
closed
fist
would
have
knocked
the
killer
out
and
yuma
did
want
this
he
slapped
until
the
other
face
became
a
livid
mass
of
swollen
flesh
he
would
have
gone
on
until
exhaustion
made
him
stop
but
the
lone
ranger
halted
him
that
enough
yuma
enough
the
masked
man
called
above
cries
of
give
hell
that
came
from
bryant
yuma
breathing
hard
stepped
back
that
just
the
start
yuh
ornery

he
gasped

o

reeling
clutching
at
a
table
for

eyes
were
red
and
blood
drooled
from
a
corner
of
his
mouth
i
did
intend
to
let
you
go
that
far
the
masked
man
said
there

place

slumped
to
the
floor
and

and
wearing
a
dazed
bewildered
expression
now

me
carefully
the
masked

three
prisoners

he
stepped
out
to
the
hall

said
your
uncle

have
his
eyes

then
then
i
was
right
in
the
first
place
penelope
face
lighted
up
with
the
announcement
the
worst
crime
of
your
uncle
was
his
refusal
to
let
friends
help
him
a
new
note
came
into
the
confusion
of
voices
on
the
first
floor
tonto
explained
that
jeb
had
been
found
and
was
telling
everything
he
knew
about
the
others
the
masked
man
listened
for
a
moment
to
the
heavy
voice
that
told
how
wallie
planned
to
place
the
murder
guilt
on
the
masked
man
and
bryant
then
the
bedroom
door
jerked
open
yuma
came
out
like
a
charging
bull
and

cried
yuma
dashing
through
the
door
in
an
instant
he
was
back
with
wallie
under
one
arm
vince
beneath
the
other
both
kicking
their
legs
and
crying
at
their
undignified
position
at
the
stairs
big
yuma
met
the
rangers
coming
up
hyar
yuh

boys
he
called
heartily
thar
a
couple
o
yore
prisoners
an
the
rest
are
comin
pronto
he
let
go
his
grip
and
the
captive
pair
dropped
to
the
stairs
and
rolled
down
part
way
where
the
texas
rangers
caught
them
it
was
then
that
penny
realized
it
the
lone
ranger
and
tonto
were
not
there
sometime
during
the
conversation
with
big
yuma
the
two
had
slipped
away
they
had
gone
down
the
front
stairs
the
texas
rangers
had
been
in
that
part
of
the
house
penny
hurried
down
the
hall
to
her
own
bedroom
and
looked
out
the
window
it
faced
the
same
as
window
did
there
were
two
horses
at
the
corner
of
the
house
paint
horse
and
the
big
white
stallion
she
saw
the
masked
man
in
the
saddle
tonto
about
to
mount
the
girl
watched
as
the
two
rode
out
across
the
basin
toward
the
distant
gap
she
felt
that
something
vital
left
her
as
that
masked
man
rode
away
and
yet
she
would
have
called
him
back
she
breathed
my
friend
the
gap
yawned
in
the
distance
a
colorful
opening
under
a
westering
sun
penelope
eyes
were
bright
as
she
finally
saw
the
two
horsemen
disappear
beyond
the
bend
chapter
xxx
the
badge
of
a
ranger
riding
through
the
gap
at
tonto
side
the
lone
ranger
seemed
lost
in
his
thoughts
his
mood
was
one
of
introspection
he
had
no
desire
for
money
he
never
in
the
least
desired
to
own
land
and
large
droves
of
livestock
and
make
deals
with
other
men
his
silver
mine
would
still
remain
unworked
why
he
wondered
should
men
want
to
make
a
trade
that
was
to
any
other
person
disadvantage
true
was
the
first
law
of
life
but
wild
things
of
the
forest
interpreted
that
law
of
nature
without
greed
or
dishonesty
they
lived
by
the
rule
of
what
was
best
for
the
greatest
number
on
the
other
hand
because
men
preyed
on
one
another
should
he
turn
his
back
upon
a
civilization
the
answer
came
to
him
then
clear
and
unmistakable
since
he
had
been
a
boy
the
strong
masked
man
had
gone
to
nature
for
his
education
now
as
a
man
unnamed
he
would
try
to
make
mankind
benefit
by
what
he
had
learned
tonto
studied
the
masked
man
with
grave
concern
he
had
tried
to
persuade
his
friend
to
halt
and
let
his
wounds
be
dressed
but
the
lone
ranger
had
refused
we
go
on
he
said
there
one
more
thing
i
want
to
do
a
period
of
riding
in
silence
brought
them
deep
inside
the
gap
tonto
asked
no
questions
made
no
comments
he
simply
rode
in
stolid
patience
wondering
if
the
lone
ranger
could
know
what
he
so
desperately
hoped
for
the
future
the
pledge
the
masked
man
had
made
had
been
fulfilled
now
the
lone
ranger
could
unmask
reclaim
his
name
and
take
his
place
once
more
with
white
men
would
that
be
his
decision
tonto
wondered
the
texan
reined
up
then
dismounted
he
still
breathed
with
difficulty
and
his
face
was
white
and
drawn
hard
lines
showed
at
each
side
of
his
mouth
as
he
stepped
close
to
one
wall
of
the
canyon
tonto
recognized
the
place
six
mounds
of
earth
and
stone
were
there
surmounted
by
six
rough
crosses
the
lone
ranger
stood
before
the
first
of
these
and
removed
his
hat
and
then
his
mask
the
soft
warm
light
of
the
sunset
brought
a
glow
into
the
texan
upraised
face
and
wiped
away
the
lines
of
pain
and
fatigue
his
lips
moved
slowly
though
the
texan
voice
was
silent
then
he
dropped
his
eyes
and
whispered
bert
he
moved
to
the
next
grave
and
paused
there
whispering
for
you
too
jim
at
the
third
small
cross
the
texan
whispered
dave
and
at
the
next
he
called
to
grant
then
don
at
the
sixth
grave
the
tall
white
man
crouched
and
scooped
aside
the
dirt
and
shale
he
reached
into
the
pocket
of
his
shirt
and
withdrew
a
star
of
metal
he
looked
at
it
for
just
a
moment
the
badge
of
the
ranger
caught
the
sun
light
and
sent
it
sparkling
into
tonto
eyes
then
the
texan
dropped
the
badge
into
the
hollow
he
had
made
and
covered
it
now
he
rose
and
faced
the
indian
he
nodded
ever
so
slightly
as
if
he
understood
what
tonto
hoped
for
and
desired
a
faint
smile
broke
the
corners
of
his
mouth
as
he
replaced
the
mask
across
his
eyes
a
little
rest
he
said
to
give
my
wounds
a
chance
to
heal
and
then
we
ride
again
tonto
said
me
know
good
camp
we
go
there
tonto
fix
wound
the
masked
man
put
on
his
hat
and
jerked
it
low
he
placed
one
foot
in
the
stirrup
we
he
said
will
go
there
now
he
swung
his
leg
across
the
saddle
and
his
voice
rang
out
with
a
crystal
clearness
that
carried
through
bryant
gap
echoing
and
from
wall
to
wall
silver
silver
leaped
ahead
his
master
in
the
saddle
tonto
rode
behind
and
grinned
in
happiness
following
the
tall
masked
man
whom
he
called
friend
