the
secret
battle
by
herbert
author
of
bomber
methuen
essex
street
london
published
in
the
secret
battle
i
i
am
going
to
write
down
some
of
the
history
of
harry
penrose
because
i
do
not
think
full
justice
has
been
done
to
him
and
because
there
must
be
many
other
young
men
of
his
kind
who
flung
themselves
into
this
war
at
the
beginning
of
it
and
have
gone
out
of
it
after
many
sufferings
with
the
unjust
and
ignorant
condemnation
of
their
fellows
at
times
it
may
be
i
shall
seem
to
digress
into
the
dreary
commonplaces
of
all
but
you
will
never
understand
the
ruthless
progression
of
penrose
tragedy
without
some
acquaintance
with
each
chapter
of
his
life
in
the
army
he
joined
the
battalion
only
a
few
days
before
we
left
plymouth
for
gallipoli
a
shy
person
with
smooth
freckled
skin
and
quick
nervous
movements
and
although
he
was
at
once
posted
to
my
company
we
had
not
become
at
all
intimate
when
we
steamed
at
last
into
mudros
bay
but
he
had
interested
me
from
the
first
and
at
intervals
in
the
busy
routine
of
a
troopship
passing
without
escort
through
submarine
waters
i
had
been
watching
him
and
delighting
in
his
keenness
and
happy
disposition
it
was
not
my
first
voyage
through
the
mediterranean
though
it
was
the
first
i
had
made
in
a
transport
and
i
liked
to
see
my
own
earlier
enthusiasm
vividly
reproduced
in
him
cape
spartel
and
the
first
glimpse
of
africa
tangiers
and
tarifa
and
all
that
magical
hour
steaming
through
the
narrow
waters
with
the
pink
and
white
houses
hiding
under
the
hills
gibraltar
town
shimmering
and
asleep
in
the
noonday
sun
malta
and
the
bumboat
women
carozzes
swaying
through
the
narrow
chattering
streets
cool
drinks
at
cafés
in
a
babel
of
strange
tongues
all
these
were
to
penrose
part
of
the
authentic
glamour
of
the
east
and
he
said
so
i
might
have
told
him
with
the
fatuous
pomp
of
wider
experience
that
they
were
in
truth
but
a
very
distant
reflection
of
the
genuine
east
but
i
did
not
for
it
was
refreshing
to
see
any
one
so
frankly
confessing
to
the
sensations
of
adventure
and
romance
to
other
members
of
the
officers
mess
the
spectacle
of
gibraltar
from
the
sea
may
have
been
more
stimulating
than
the
spectacle
of
southend
though
this
is
doubtful
but
it
is
certain
that
few
of
them
would
have
admitted
the
grave
impeachment
at
malta
some
of
us
spent
an
evening
ashore
and
sat
for
a
little
in
a
tawdry
riotous
little
café
where
two
poor
singing
women
strove
vainly
to
make
themselves
heard
above
the
pandemonium
of
clinked
glasses
and
bawled
orders
there
we
met
many
officers
newly
returned
from
the
landing
at
cape
helles
some
of
them
with
slight
bodily
wounds
but
all
of
them
with
grievous
injury
staring
out
of
their
eyes
those
of
them
who
would
speak
at
all
were
voluble
with
anecdotes
of
horror
and
blood
most
of
our
own
party
had
not
yet
lost
the
mood
in
which
men
went
to
the
war
in
those
days
the
illusion
of
war
was
not
yet
dispelled
also
individually
no
doubt
we
had
that
curious
confidence
of
the
unblooded
soldier
that
none
of
these
strange
terrible
things
could
ever
actually
happen
to
we
should
for
ever
hang
upon
the
pleasant
fringes
of
war
sailing
in
strange
seas
and
drinking
in
strange
towns
but
never
definitely
entangled
in
the
more
crude
and
distasteful
circumstances
of
battle
and
if
there
were
any
of
us
with
a
secret
consciousness
that
we
deceived
ourselves
was
no
time
to
tear
away
the
veil
let
there
be
lights
and
laughter
and
wine
if
need
be
let
us
be
told
how
the
wounded
had
drowned
in
the
wired
shallows
and
reckon
the
toll
of
that
unforgettable
exploit
and
the
terrors
that
were
still
at
work
and
so
we
would
not
be
dragooned
into
seriousness
by
these
messengers
from
the
peninsula
but
rather
with
no
injury
to
their
feelings
laughed
at
their
croakings
and
continued
to
drink
but
harry
penrose
was
different
he
was
all
eagerness
to
hear
every
detail
hideous
and
heroic
there
was
one
officer
present
from
the
division
a
man
about
thirty
with
a
tanned
melancholy
face
and
great
solemn
eyes
which
for
all
the
horrors
he
related
seemed
to
have
something
yet
more
horrible
hidden
in
their
depths
him
harry
plied
with
questions
his
mood
flung
impatiently
aside
and
the
man
seemed
ready
to
tell
him
things
though
from
his
occasional
reservations
and
sorrowful
smile
i
knew
that
he
was
pitying
harry
for
his
youth
his
eagerness
and
his
ignorance
around
us
were
the
curses
of
overworked
waiters
and
the
babble
of
loud
conversations
and
the
smell
of
spilt
beer
there
were
two
officers
uproariously
drunk
and
in
the
distance
pathetic
snatches
of
songs
were
heard
from
the
struggling
singer
on
the
dais
we
were
in
one
of
the
first
outposts
of
the
empire
and
halfway
to
one
of
her
greatest
adventures
and
this
excited
youth
at
my
side
was
the
only
one
of
all
that
throng
who
was
ready
to
hear
the
truth
of
it
and
to
speak
of
death
i
lay
emphasis
on
this
incident
because
it
well
illustrates
his
attitude
towards
the
war
at
that
time
which
too
many
have
now
forgotten
and
because
i
then
first
found
the
image
which
alone
reflects
the
many
curiosities
of
his
personality
he
was
like
an
imaginative
inquisitive
child
a
child
that
cherishes
a
secret
gallery
of
pictures
in
its
mind
and
must
continually
be
feeding
this
storehouse
with
new
pictures
of
the
unknown
that
is
not
content
with
a
vague
outline
of
something
that
is
to
come
a
dentist
or
a
visit
or
a
doll
but
will
not
rest
till
the
experience
is
safely
put
away
in
its
place
a
clear
uncompromising
picture
to
be
taken
down
and
played
with
at
will
moreover
he
had
the
fearlessness
of
a
child
but
i
shall
come
to
that
later
and
so
we
came
to
mudros
threading
a
placid
way
between
the
deceitful
aegean
islands
harry
loved
them
because
they
wore
so
green
and
inviting
an
aspect
and
again
i
did
not
undeceive
him
and
tell
him
how
parched
and
austere
how
barren
of
comfortable
grass
and
shade
he
would
find
them
on
closer
acquaintance
we
steamed
into
mudros
bay
at
the
end
of
an
unbelievable
sunset
in
the
great
harbour
were
gathered
regiments
of
ships
battleship
cruiser
tramp
transport
and
trawler
and
as
the
sun
sank
into
the
western
hills
the
masts
and
the
rigging
of
all
of
them
were
radiant
with
its
last
rays
while
all
their
decks
and
hulls
lay
already
in
the
soft
blue
dusk
there
is
something
extraordinarily
soothing
in
the
almost
imperceptible
motion
of
a
big
steamer
gliding
at
slow
speed
to
her
anchorage
as
i
leaned
over
the
rail
of
the
and
heard
the
tiny
float
across
from
the
french
or
english
warships
and
watched
the
miniature
crews
at
work
upon
their
decks
i
became
aware
that
penrose
was
similarly
engaged
close
at
hand
and
it
seemed
to
me
an
opportunity
to
learn
something
of
the
history
of
this
strange
young
man
beginning
with
his
delight
in
the
voyage
and
all
the
marvellous
romance
of
our
surroundings
i
led
him
on
to
speak
of
himself
both
his
parents
had
died
when
he
was
a
boy
at
school
they
had
left
him
enough
to
go
to
oxford
upon
without
the
help
of
the
exhibition
he
had
won
and
he
had
but
just
completed
his
second
year
there
when
the
war
broke
out
for
some
mysterious
reason
he
had
immediately
enlisted
instead
of
applying
for
a
commission
like
his
friends
i
gathered
though
not
from
anything
he
directly
said
that
he
had
had
a
hard
time
in
the
ranks
the
majority
of
his
companions
in
training
had
come
down
from
the
north
with
the
first
draft
of
tynesiders
and
though
god
knows
the
tynesider
as
a
fighting
man
has
been
unsurpassed
in
this
war
they
were
a
wild
rough
crowd
before
they
became
soldiers
and
i
can
understand
that
for
a
sensitive
boy
of
his
type
the
intimate
daily
round
of
eating
talking
and
sleeping
with
them
must
have
made
large
demands
on
his
patriotism
and
grit
but
he
said
it
did
him
good
and
it
was
only
the
pestering
of
his
guardian
and
relations
that
after
six
months
forced
him
to
take
a
commission
he
had
a
curious
lack
of
confidence
in
his
fitness
to
be
an
officer
a
feeling
which
is
deplorably
absent
in
hundreds
not
half
as
fit
as
he
was
but
from
what
i
had
seen
of
his
handling
of
his
platoon
on
the
voyage
and
the
men
are
difficult
after
a
week
or
two
at
sea
i
was
able
to
assure
him
that
he
need
have
no
qualms
he
was
i
discovered
pathetically
full
of
military
ambitions
he
dreamed
already
he
confessed
of
decorations
and
promotions
and
glorious
charges
in
short
he
was
like
many
another
undergraduate
officer
of
those
days
in
his
eagerness
and
readiness
for
sacrifice
but
far
removed
from
the
common
type
in
his
romantic
imaginative
outlook
towards
the
war
is
the
only
word
i
think
and
it
is
melancholy
for
me
to
remember
that
even
then
i
said
to
myself
wonder
how
long
the
romance
will
last
my
son
but
i
could
not
guess
just
how
terrible
was
to
be
its
decay
ii
we
were
not
to
be
long
at
mudros
for
three
days
we
lay
in
the
sweltering
heat
of
the
great
bay
watching
the
warships
come
and
go
and
buying
fruit
from
the
little
greek
sailing
boats
which
fluttered
round
the
harbour
these
were
days
of
hot
anxiety
about
kit
hourly
each
officer
reorganized
and
his
exiguous
belongings
and
his
valise
and
jettisoned
yet
more
precious
articles
of
comfort
lest
the
weight
regulations
be
violated
and
for
the
sake
of
an
extra
shirt
the
whole
of
one
equipment
be
cast
into
the
sea
by
the
mysterious
figure
we
believed
to
watch
over
these
things
afterwards
we
found
that
all
our
care
was
in
vain
and
in
the
comfortless
camps
of
the
peninsula
bitterly
bewailed
the
little
luxuries
we
had
needlessly
left
behind
now
so
unattainable
down
in
the
odorous
the
men
wrote
long
letters
describing
the
battles
in
which
they
were
already
engaged
and
the
sound
of
quite
mythical
guns
but
on
the
third
day
came
our
sailing
orders
in
the
evening
a
little
trawler
promoted
to
the
dignity
of
a
came
alongside
and
all
the
regiment
of
gross
overloaded
figures
festooned
with
armament
and
bags
of
food
and
strange
knobbly
parcels
tumbled
heavily
over
the
side
many
men
have
written
of
the
sailing
of
the
first
argosy
of
troopships
from
that
bay
and
by
this
time
the
spectacle
of
departing
troops
was
an
old
one
to
the
vessels
there
but
this
did
not
diminish
the
quality
of
their
farewells
all
the
king
ships
ship
as
we
passed
and
sent
us
a
great
wave
of
cheering
that
filled
the
heart
with
sadness
and
resolution
in
one
of
the
french
ships
was
a
party
of
her
crew
high
up
somewhere
above
the
deck
and
they
sang
for
us
with
astonishing
accuracy
and
feeling
the
du
départ
so
moving
was
this
that
even
the
stolid
northerners
in
our
sweeper
were
stirred
to
make
some
more
articulate
acknowledgment
than
the
official
british
cheer
and
one
old
pitman
searching
among
his
memories
of
some
lancashire
dug
out
a
rough
version
of
the
by
degrees
all
our
men
took
up
the
tune
and
sang
it
mightily
with
no
suspicion
of
words
and
the
officers
not
less
timidly
joined
in
and
were
proud
of
the
men
for
what
they
had
done
for
many
were
moved
in
that
moment
who
were
never
moved
before
but
while
we
were
yet
warm
with
cheering
and
the
sense
of
knighthood
we
cleared
the
boom
and
shivered
a
little
in
the
breeze
of
the
open
sea
the
sun
went
down
and
soon
it
was
very
cold
in
the
sweeper
and
in
each
man
heart
i
think
there
was
a
certain
chill
there
were
no
more
songs
but
the
men
whispered
in
small
groups
or
stood
silent
shifting
uneasily
their
wearisome
packs
for
now
we
were
indeed
cut
on
from
civilization
and
committed
to
the
unknown
the
transport
we
had
left
seemed
a
very
haven
of
comfort
and
security
one
thought
longingly
of
white
tables
in
the
saloon
and
the
unfriendly
linen
bags
of
and
biscuits
we
carried
were
concrete
evidence
of
a
new
life
the
war
seemed
no
longer
remote
and
each
of
us
realized
indignantly
that
we
were
personally
involved
in
it
so
for
a
little
all
these
soldiers
had
a
period
of
serious
thought
unusual
in
the
soldier
life
but
as
we
neared
the
peninsula
the
excitement
and
novelty
and
the
prospect
of
exercising
cramped
limbs
brought
back
valour
and
cheerfulness
at
malta
we
had
heard
many
tales
of
the
still
terrifying
ordeal
of
landing
under
fire
but
such
terrors
were
not
for
us
there
was
a
bright
moon
and
as
we
saw
the
pale
cliffs
of
cape
helles
all
i
think
expected
each
moment
a
torrent
of
shells
from
some
obscure
quarter
but
instead
an
unearthly
stillness
brooded
over
the
two
bays
and
only
a
morse
lamp
blinking
at
the
sweeper
suggested
that
any
living
thing
was
there
and
there
came
over
the
water
a
strange
musty
smell
some
said
it
was
the
smell
of
the
dead
and
some
the
smell
of
an
incinerator
myself
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
the
smell
of
the
peninsula
for
ever
which
no
man
can
forget
we
disembarked
at
a
pier
of
rafts
by
the
and
stumbled
eagerly
ashore
and
now
we
were
in
the
very
heart
of
heroic
things
nowhere
i
think
was
the
new
soldier
plunged
so
suddenly
into
the
genuine
scenes
of
war
as
he
was
at
gallipoli
in
france
there
was
a
long
transition
of
and
railway
trains
and
billets
and
he
moved
by
easy
gradations
to
the
but
here
a
few
hours
after
a
night
in
linen
sheets
we
stood
suddenly
on
the
very
sand
where
but
three
weeks
before
those
hideous
in
the
cliffs
had
mown
down
that
astonishing
party
of
april
and
in
that
silver
stillness
it
was
difficult
to
believe
we
shambled
off
up
the
steady
slope
between
two
cliffs
marvelling
that
any
men
could
have
prevailed
against
so
perfect
a
of
fire
by
now
we
were
very
tired
and
it
was
heavy
work
labouring
through
the
soft
sand
queer
figures
in
white
robes
peered
at
us
from
dark
corners
and
here
and
there
a
man
poked
a
tousled
head
from
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
blinked
upon
our
progress
some
one
remarked
that
it
reminded
him
of
nothing
so
much
as
the
native
camp
at
earl
court
on
a
fine
august
evening
and
that
indeed
was
the
effect
after
a
little
the
stillness
was
broken
by
a
sound
which
we
could
not
conceal
from
ourselves
was
distant
rattle
of
musketry
somewhere
a
gun
fired
startlingly
and
now
as
we
went
each
man
felt
vaguely
that
at
any
minute
we
might
be
plunged
into
the
thick
of
a
battle
laden
as
we
were
and
i
think
each
man
braced
himself
for
a
desperate
struggle
such
is
the
effect
of
marching
in
the
dark
to
an
unknown
destination
soon
we
were
halted
in
a
piece
of
apparently
waste
land
circled
by
trees
and
ordered
to
dig
ourselves
a
habitation
at
once
for
the
morning
it
was
whispered
turks
search
all
this
ground
everything
was
said
in
a
kind
of
hoarse
mysterious
whisper
presumably
to
conceal
our
observations
from
the
ears
of
the
turks
five
miles
away
but
then
we
did
not
know
they
were
five
miles
away
we
had
no
idea
where
they
were
or
where
we
were
ourselves
men
glanced
furtively
at
the
north
star
for
guidance
and
were
pained
to
find
that
contrary
to
their
military
teaching
it
told
them
nothing
even
the
digging
was
carried
on
a
little
stealthily
till
it
was
discovered
that
the
turks
were
not
behind
those
trees
the
digging
was
a
comfort
to
the
men
who
being
pitmen
were
now
in
their
element
and
the
officers
found
solace
in
whispering
to
each
other
that
magical
communication
about
the
prospective
it
was
the
first
technical
word
they
had
used
the
field
and
they
were
secretly
proud
to
know
what
it
meant
in
a
little
the
dawn
began
and
the
grey
trees
took
shape
and
the
sun
came
up
out
of
asia
and
we
saw
at
last
the
little
peak
of
achi
baba
absurdly
pink
and
diminutive
in
the
distance
a
man
first
frontal
impression
of
that
great
rampart
with
the
outlying
slopes
masking
the
summit
was
that
it
was
disappointingly
small
but
when
he
had
lived
under
and
upon
it
for
a
while
day
by
day
it
seemed
to
grow
in
menace
and
in
bulk
and
ultimately
became
a
hideous
overpowering
monster
pervading
all
his
life
so
that
it
worked
upon
men
nerves
and
almost
everywhere
in
the
peninsula
they
were
painfully
conscious
that
every
movement
they
made
could
be
watched
from
somewhere
on
that
massive
hill
but
now
the
kitchens
had
come
and
there
was
breakfast
and
viscous
milkless
tea
we
discovered
that
all
around
our
seeming
solitude
the
earth
had
been
peopled
with
sleepers
who
now
emerged
from
their
holes
there
was
a
stir
of
washing
and
cooking
and
singing
and
the
smoke
went
up
from
the
wood
fires
in
the
clear
cool
air
d
company
officers
made
their
camp
under
an
with
a
view
over
the
blue
water
to
samothrace
and
imbros
and
now
in
the
early
cool
before
the
sun
had
gathered
his
noonday
malignity
it
was
very
pleasant
at
seven
the
began
a
mile
away
on
the
northern
cliffs
the
first
shell
burst
stampeding
a
number
of
horses
the
warning
scream
and
the
final
crash
gave
all
the
expectant
battalion
a
faintly
pleasurable
thrill
and
as
each
shell
came
a
little
nearer
the
sensation
remained
no
one
was
afraid
without
the
knowledge
of
experience
no
one
could
be
seriously
afraid
on
this
cool
sunny
morning
in
the
grove
of
those
chill
hours
in
the
sweeper
had
been
much
more
alarming
the
common
sensation
was
last
i
am
really
under
fire
i
shall
write
home
and
tell
them
about
it
and
then
when
it
seemed
that
the
line
on
which
the
shells
were
falling
must
if
continued
pass
through
the
middle
of
our
camp
the
firing
mysteriously
ceased
harry
i
know
was
disappointed
personally
i
was
pleased
i
learned
more
about
harry
that
afternoon
he
had
been
much
exhausted
by
the
long
night
but
was
now
refreshed
and
filled
with
an
almost
childish
enthusiasm
by
the
pictorial
attractions
of
the
place
for
this
enthusiastic
soul
one
thing
only
was
lacking
in
the
site
of
the
camp
the
rise
of
the
hill
which
here
runs
down
the
centre
of
the
peninsula
hid
from
us
the
dardanelles
these
he
said
must
immediately
be
viewed
it
was
a
bright
afternoon
of
blue
skies
and
gentle
air
not
yet
had
the
dry
wind
come
to
plague
us
with
and
all
the
vivid
colours
of
the
scene
were
unspoiled
we
walked
over
the
hill
through
the
parched
scrub
where
lizards
darted
from
under
our
feet
and
tortoises
lay
comatose
in
the
scanty
shade
and
came
to
a
kind
of
inland
cliff
where
the
turks
had
had
many
riflemen
at
the
landing
for
all
the
ground
was
littered
with
empty
cartridges
and
there
was
unfolded
surely
the
most
gorgeous
panorama
this
war
has
provided
for
prosaic
englishmen
to
see
below
was
a
cool
inviting
grove
of
imperial
cypresses
all
along
the
narrow
strip
between
us
and
the
shore
lay
the
of
the
french
where
moved
lazy
figures
in
blue
and
red
and
black
senegalese
in
many
colours
to
the
left
was
the
wide
sweep
of
morto
bay
and
beyond
the
first
section
of
achi
baba
rising
to
de
tott
battery
in
terraces
of
olives
and
vines
but
what
caught
the
immediate
eye
what
we
had
come
to
see
and
had
sailed
hither
to
fight
for
was
that
strip
of
unbelievably
blue
water
before
us
deep
generous
blue
like
a
chinese
bowl
on
the
farther
shore
towards
the
entrance
to
the
straits
we
could
see
a
wide
green
plain
and
beyond
and
to
the
left
peak
after
peak
of
the
mountains
of
asia
and
far
away
in
the
middle
distance
there
was
a
glint
of
snow
from
some
regal
summit
of
the
anatolian
mountains
that
wide
green
plain
was
the
plain
of
troy
the
scarcity
of
classical
scholars
in
expeditionary
forces
and
the
wearisome
observations
of
pressmen
on
the
subject
of
troy
have
combined
to
belittle
the
significance
of
the
classical
surroundings
of
the
gallipoli
campaign
i
myself
am
a
stolid
person
but
i
confess
that
the
spectacle
of
those
historic
flats
was
not
one
in
diplomatic
phrase
which
i
could
view
with
indifference
on
harry
ridiculously
excited
already
the
effect
was
almost
alarming
he
became
quite
lyrical
over
two
little
sweepers
apparently
anchored
near
the
mouth
of
the
straits
he
said
have
been
where
the
greek
fleet
lay
god
it
wonderful
up
on
the
slope
towards
de
tott
battery
the
guns
were
busy
and
now
and
then
asiatic
annie
sent
over
a
large
shell
from
the
region
of
achilles
tomb
which
burst
ponderously
in
the
sea
off
cape
helles
and
there
we
sat
on
the
rough
edge
of
the
cliff
and
talked
of
achilles
and
hector
and
diomed
and
patroclus
and
the
bolts
of
jove
i
do
not
defend
or
exalt
this
action
but
this
is
a
truthful
record
of
a
man
personality
and
i
simply
state
what
occurred
and
i
confess
that
with
the
best
wish
in
the
world
i
was
myself
becoming
a
little
bored
with
troy
when
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
he
suddenly
became
silent
and
gazed
across
the
straits
with
a
fixed
pinched
look
in
his
face
like
a
man
who
is
reminded
of
some
calamity
he
had
forgotten
for
perhaps
a
minute
he
maintained
this
rigid
aspect
and
then
as
suddenly
relaxed
murmuring
in
a
tone
of
relentless
determination
will
it
was
not
in
me
not
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
this
passionate
intention
and
somehow
i
induced
him
to
explain
it
seemed
that
in
spite
of
his
genuine
academic
successes
and
a
moderate
popularity
at
school
and
at
oxford
he
had
suffered
from
early
boyhood
from
a
curious
distrust
of
his
own
capacity
in
the
face
of
anything
he
had
to
do
in
a
measure
no
doubt
this
had
even
contributed
to
his
successes
for
his
nervousness
took
the
form
of
an
intimate
silent
brooding
over
any
ordeal
that
lay
before
him
whether
it
was
a
visit
to
his
uncle
or
or
a
dance
he
would
lie
awake
for
hours
imagining
all
conceivable
forms
of
error
and
failure
and
humiliation
that
might
befall
him
in
his
endeavour
and
though
he
was
to
this
extent
forewarned
and
forearmed
it
must
have
been
a
painful
process
and
it
explained
to
me
the
puzzling
intervals
of
seeming
melancholy
which
i
had
seen
varying
his
usually
cheerful
demeanour
remember
last
night
he
said
had
been
detailed
to
look
after
the
baggage
when
we
disembarked
and
take
charge
of
the
as
far
as
i
know
i
did
the
job
all
right
except
for
losing
old
tompkins
valise
but
you
ca
think
how
much
worry
and
anxiety
it
gave
me
all
the
time
on
the
sweeper
i
was
imagining
the
hundreds
of
possible
disasters
the
not
turning
up
and
me
left
alone
on
the
boat
with
the
baggage
the
colonel
things
being
dropped
overboard
a
row
with
the
getting
the
baggage
ashore
and
then
losing
the
battalion
or
the
or
the
baggage
it
all
worked
out
quite
simply
but
i
tell
you
benson
it
gave
me
hell
and
it
always
the
same
that
really
why
i
did
take
a
commission
because
i
could
imagine
myself
drilling
men
once
without
becoming
a
permanent
i
know
now
that
i
was
a
fool
about
that
i
usually
do
find
that
out
but
i
ca
escape
the
feeling
next
time
now
it
not
only
little
things
like
that
but
that
what
i
feel
about
the
whole
war
i
a
terror
of
being
a
failure
in
it
a
failure
out
here
you
know
a
sort
of
regimental
dud
i
heard
of
lots
of
them
the
kind
of
man
that
nobody
gives
an
important
job
because
sure
to
muck
it
up
though
i
do
believe
eccleston
more
likely
to
be
that
than
me
but
that
what
i
was
thinking
just
now
somehow
looking
at
this
view
troy
and
all
that
and
thinking
how
those
greeks
sweated
blood
for
ten
years
on
afternoons
like
this
doing
their
duty
for
the
damned
old
kings
and
how
we
come
out
here
to
fight
in
the
same
place
thousands
of
years
afterwards
and
we
still
know
about
them
and
remember
their
names
well
it
gave
me
a
kind
of
inspiration
i
do
know
why
i
got
a
bit
of
confidence
god
knows
how
long
it
will
last
but
i
swear
i
wo
be
a
failure
i
wo
be
the
battalion
dud
and
i
have
a
damned
good
try
to
get
a
medal
of
some
sort
and
be
like
like
achilles
or
somebody
sheer
breathlessness
put
a
sudden
end
to
this
outburst
and
since
it
was
followed
by
a
certain
shyness
at
his
own
revelations
i
did
not
probe
deeper
but
i
thought
to
myself
that
this
young
man
spirit
of
romance
would
die
hard
i
did
not
know
whether
it
would
ever
die
for
certainly
i
had
never
seen
that
spirit
working
so
powerfully
in
any
man
as
a
positive
incentive
to
achievement
and
i
tell
you
all
this
because
i
want
you
to
understand
how
it
was
with
him
in
the
beginning
but
now
the
bay
was
in
shadow
below
us
on
the
hill
the
solemn
stillness
that
comes
over
all
trenches
in
the
hour
before
dusk
had
already
descended
and
away
towards
the
cape
the
indians
were
coming
out
to
kneel
in
prayer
beside
the
alien
sea
the
romance
of
war
was
in
full
song
and
scrambling
down
the
cliff
we
bathed
almost
reverently
in
the
hellespont
ii
those
first
three
days
were
for
many
of
us
who
did
not
know
the
mild
autumn
months
the
most
pleasant
we
spent
on
the
peninsula
the
last
weeks
of
may
had
something
of
the
quality
of
an
old
english
summer
and
the
seven
plagues
of
the
peninsula
had
not
yet
attained
the
intolerable
violence
of
june
and
july
true
the
inhabited
portion
of
the
narrow
land
we
won
had
already
become
in
great
part
a
wilderness
the
myrtle
and
and
tangled
cistus
and
all
that
wealth
of
spring
flowers
in
which
the
landing
parties
had
fallen
and
died
in
april
had
long
been
trodden
to
death
and
there
were
wide
stretches
of
yellow
desert
where
not
even
the
parched
scrub
survived
but
in
the
two
and
a
half
miles
of
bare
country
which
lay
between
the
capes
and
the
of
achi
baba
was
one
considerable
oasis
of
olives
and
stunted
oaks
and
therein
on
the
slopes
of
the
bridge
was
our
camp
fortunately
set
the
word
contains
an
unmerited
compliment
to
the
place
the
manner
of
its
birth
was
characteristic
of
military
arrangements
in
those
days
when
we
were
told
on
that
first
mysterious
midnight
to
dig
ourselves
a
shelter
against
the
morning
we
were
far
from
imagining
that
what
we
dug
would
be
our
peninsular
and
haven
of
rest
from
the
for
many
months
to
come
and
so
we
made
what
we
conceived
to
be
the
quickest
and
simplest
form
of
shelter
against
a
quite
temporary
emergency
long
straight
untraversed
ditches
running
parallel
to
and
with
but
a
few
yards
between
each
other
no
worse
form
of
permanent
could
conceivably
have
been
constructed
for
the
men
were
cramped
in
these
places
with
a
minimum
of
comfort
and
a
maximum
of
danger
no
man
could
climb
out
of
his
narrow
drain
without
casting
a
shower
of
dust
from
the
crumbling
parapet
on
to
his
sleeping
neighbour
in
the
next
ditch
and
three
large
german
shells
could
have
destroyed
half
the
regiment
yet
there
were
many
such
camps
most
of
them
lacking
the
grateful
concealment
of
our
trees
such
targets
even
the
turkish
artillery
must
sometimes
hit
there
were
no
in
the
accepted
sense
of
the
western
front
no
deep
elaborate
chambers
hollowed
out
by
miners
with
miners
material
in
truth
shallow
excavations
scooped
in
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
only
roof
for
a
man
against
sun
and
shells
was
a
waterproof
sheet
stretched
precariously
over
his
hole
it
is
sufficient
testimony
to
the
indifference
of
the
turkish
artillery
that
with
such
naked
concentrations
of
men
scattered
about
the
peninsula
casualties
in
the
were
so
few
each
officer
had
his
own
private
hole
set
democratically
among
the
men
and
an
officers
mess
was
simply
made
by
digging
a
larger
hole
and
roofing
it
with
waterproof
sheets
instead
of
one
there
was
no
luxury
among
the
infantry
there
and
the
gulf
which
yawns
between
the
lives
of
officer
and
man
in
france
as
regards
material
comfort
was
barely
discernible
in
gallipoli
food
was
dull
and
monotonous
for
weeks
we
had
only
and
biscuits
and
a
little
coarse
bacon
and
tea
but
it
was
the
same
for
all
one
honourable
equality
of
discomfort
at
first
there
were
no
canteen
facilities
and
when
some
newcomer
came
from
one
of
the
islands
with
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
another
of
chartreuse
we
drank
it
with
and
biscuit
drinking
water
was
as
precious
as
the
elixir
of
life
and
almost
as
unobtainable
but
officer
and
man
had
the
same
ration
to
eke
out
through
the
thirsty
day
wells
were
sunk
and
sometimes
immediately
condemned
and
when
we
knew
the
water
was
clear
and
sweet
to
taste
it
was
hard
to
have
it
corrupted
with
the
metallic
flavour
of
chemicals
by
the
medical
staff
then
indeed
did
a
man
learn
to
love
water
then
did
he
learn
discipline
when
he
filled
his
in
the
morning
with
the
exiguous
ration
of
the
day
and
fought
with
the
intolerable
craving
to
put
it
to
his
lips
and
there
and
then
gurgle
down
his
fill
in
the
spring
nights
it
was
very
cold
and
men
shivered
in
their
single
blanket
under
the
unimaginable
stars
but
very
early
the
sun
came
up
and
by
five
all
the
camp
were
singing
and
there
were
three
hours
of
fresh
coolness
when
it
was
very
good
to
wash
in
a
canvas
bucket
and
smoke
in
the
sun
before
the
torrid
time
came
on
and
again
at
seven
when
the
sun
sat
perched
on
the
great
rock
of
samothrace
and
imbros
was
set
in
a
fleecy
marvel
of
pink
and
saffron
clouds
there
were
two
hours
of
pure
physical
content
but
these
i
think
were
more
nearly
perfect
than
the
morning
because
they
succeeded
the
irritable
fevers
of
the
day
then
the
crickets
in
the
branches
sang
less
tediously
and
the
flies
melted
away
and
all
over
the
peninsula
the
wood
fires
began
to
twinkle
in
the
dusk
as
the
men
cooked
over
a
few
sticks
the
little
delicacies
which
were
preserved
for
this
hour
of
respite
when
we
had
done
we
sat
under
our
in
the
clear
twilight
and
watched
the
last
aeroplanes
sail
home
to
rabbit
islands
and
talked
and
argued
till
the
glimmering
in
the
scrub
and
up
the
hill
the
long
roll
of
the
turks
rapid
fire
told
us
that
darkness
was
at
hand
and
the
chill
dew
sent
us
into
our
crannies
to
sleep
so
we
were
not
sorry
for
three
days
of
quiet
in
the
camp
before
we
went
up
the
hill
harry
alone
was
all
eagerness
to
reach
the
with
the
least
possible
delay
but
then
harry
was
like
none
of
us
indeed
none
of
us
were
like
each
other
it
would
have
been
strange
if
we
had
been
have
noted
with
an
accent
of
astonishment
the
strange
diversity
of
persons
to
be
found
in
units
of
the
new
army
and
the
essential
sameness
of
their
attitude
to
the
war
as
though
a
man
were
to
go
into
the
haymarket
and
be
surprised
if
the
first
twelve
pedestrians
there
were
not
of
the
same
profession
were
then
to
summon
them
to
the
assistance
of
a
woman
in
the
hands
of
a
rough
and
be
still
surprised
at
the
similarity
of
their
methods
we
were
in
truth
a
motley
crowd
gathered
from
everywhere
but
when
we
sat
under
that
we
were
very
much
alike
with
the
single
exception
of
harry
egerton
our
company
commander
a
man
of
about
thirty
with
a
round
face
and
a
large
head
was
a
stockbroker
by
profession
and
rather
improbably
an
old
territorial
by
pastime
he
was
an
excellent
company
commander
but
would
have
made
a
still
more
admirable
for
his
training
in
figures
and
his
meticulous
habits
in
such
things
as
the
keeping
of
accounts
were
just
what
is
required
of
a
and
were
lamentably
deficient
in
myself
the
intricacies
of
acquittance
rolls
and
imprest
accounts
and
page
of
the
soldier
were
meat
and
drink
to
him
and
in
general
i
must
confess
that
i
shamefully
surrendered
such
delicacies
to
him
harry
penrose
had
the
platoon
of
the
other
three
subalterns
perhaps
the
most
interesting
was
hewett
he
like
harry
had
been
at
oxford
before
the
war
though
they
had
never
come
together
there
he
was
a
fair
dreamy
person
of
remarkably
good
looks
alone
of
all
the
apollos
i
have
known
did
he
at
all
deserve
that
title
most
of
these
have
been
men
of
surpassing
stupidity
and
material
tastes
but
hewett
added
to
his
physical
qualifications
something
of
the
mental
refinement
which
presumably
one
should
expect
of
even
a
modern
apollo
intensely
fastidious
he
frankly
detested
the
war
and
all
the
dirt
and
disgust
he
must
personally
encounter
like
harry
he
was
an
idealist
but
more
so
for
he
could
not
idealize
the
war
but
the
shrinking
of
his
spirit
had
no
effect
on
his
conduct
he
was
no
less
courageous
than
harry
or
any
one
else
and
no
less
keen
to
see
the
thing
through
only
at
that
time
he
was
a
little
less
blind
a
year
senior
to
harry
he
had
taken
greats
in
and
though
his
degree
had
been
disappointingly
low
he
had
not
yet
lost
the
passionate
attachment
of
the
man
to
philosophy
and
thoughts
of
the
ultimate
truths
sometimes
he
would
try
to
induce
one
of
us
to
talk
with
him
of
his
religious
and
philosophical
doubts
but
in
that
feverish
place
it
was
too
difficult
for
us
and
usually
he
brooded
over
his
problems
alone
eustace
of
the
platoon
was
a
journalist
by
repute
though
it
was
never
discovered
to
what
journal
if
any
he
was
specially
attached
his
character
was
more
attractive
than
his
appearance
which
was
long
awkward
and
angular
and
if
he
had
ever
been
to
school
he
would
have
been
quite
undeservedly
unpopular
for
not
playing
games
undeservedly
because
one
could
not
conceive
of
him
as
playing
any
game
physically
indeed
he
was
one
of
nature
gawks
intellectually
he
was
nimble
not
to
say
athletic
with
an
acute
and
deeply
logical
mind
as
a
companion
more
especially
a
companion
in
war
he
was
made
tedious
by
a
habit
of
cynicism
and
a
passion
for
argument
the
cynicism
i
think
had
developed
originally
from
some
early
grievance
against
society
had
been
adopted
as
an
effective
pose
and
had
now
become
part
of
his
nature
whatever
its
origin
it
was
wearing
to
us
for
in
the
actual
scenes
of
war
one
likes
to
cling
to
one
illusions
while
any
shred
of
them
remains
and
would
rather
they
faded
honourably
under
the
gentle
influence
of
time
than
be
torn
to
fragments
in
a
moment
by
reasoned
mockery
but
eustace
was
never
tired
of
exhibiting
the
frailty
and
subterfuge
of
all
men
particularly
in
their
relations
to
the
war
the
arrived
for
him
as
regularly
as
the
german
submarines
would
allow
and
all
his
views
were
in
that
sense
distinctly
if
any
of
us
were
rash
enough
to
read
that
paper
ourselves
we
were
inevitably
provoked
to
some
comment
which
led
to
a
hot
wrangle
on
the
public
schools
or
kitchener
or
the
rights
of
the
war
and
the
pleasant
calm
of
the
dusk
was
marred
for
eustace
could
always
meet
us
with
a
powerfully
logical
case
and
while
in
spirit
we
revolted
against
his
heresies
we
were
distressed
by
the
appeal
they
made
to
our
reluctant
reasons
harry
the
most
ingenuous
of
us
all
and
the
most
devoted
to
his
illusions
was
particularly
worried
by
this
conflict
it
seemed
very
wrong
to
him
that
a
man
so
loyal
and
gallant
in
his
personal
relations
with
others
should
trample
so
ruthlessly
on
their
dearest
opinions
burnett
was
of
a
very
different
type
tall
and
muscular
with
reddish
hair
and
vivid
blue
eyes
he
looked
as
he
wanted
to
look
a
of
action
by
nature
and
practice
he
had
about
for
some
years
in
africa
and
australia
a
process
which
had
failed
equally
to
establish
his
fortunes
or
soften
his
rough
edges
and
from
the
first
he
affected
the
patronizing
attitude
of
the
experienced
campaigner
the
little
discomforts
of
camp
life
were
nothing
to
him
for
were
they
not
part
of
his
normal
life
and
when
i
emerged
from
my
pursued
by
a
centipede
of
incredible
ferocity
he
held
forth
for
a
long
time
on
the
best
method
of
dispatching
rattlesnakes
in
the
umgoga
or
some
such
locality
by
degrees
however
as
life
became
more
unbearable
the
conviction
dawned
upon
us
that
he
was
no
less
sensible
to
heat
and
hunger
and
thirst
than
mere
campaigners
and
rather
more
ready
to
utter
his
complaints
finally
the
weight
of
evidence
became
overwhelming
and
it
was
whispered
at
the
end
of
our
first
week
at
gallipoli
that
was
bogus
the
quality
of
being
was
in
those
days
the
last
word
in
military
condemnation
and
in
burnett
case
events
showed
the
verdict
to
be
lamentably
correct
so
we
were
a
strangely
assorted
crowd
only
alike
as
i
have
said
in
that
we
were
keen
on
the
winning
of
this
war
and
resolved
to
do
our
personal
best
towards
that
end
of
the
five
of
us
hewett
and
eustace
had
the
most
influence
on
harry
me
he
regarded
as
a
solid
kind
of
wall
that
would
never
let
him
down
or
be
guilty
of
any
startling
deviations
from
the
normal
by
hewett
he
was
personally
and
spiritually
attracted
by
eustace
alternately
fascinated
and
disturbed
and
it
was
a
very
bad
day
for
harry
when
hewett
death
removed
that
gentle
comfortable
influence
ii
we
were
ordered
to
relieve
the
at
midnight
on
the
fourth
day
and
once
again
we
braced
ourselves
for
the
last
desperate
battle
of
our
lives
all
soldiers
go
through
this
process
during
their
first
weeks
of
active
service
every
time
they
anywhere
immense
expectations
vows
fears
prayers
fill
their
minds
and
nothing
particular
happens
only
the
really
experienced
soldier
knows
that
it
is
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
for
anything
particular
to
happen
and
the
heroes
of
romance
and
history
who
do
not
move
a
muscle
when
told
that
they
are
to
attack
at
dawn
are
generally
quite
undeserving
of
praise
since
long
experience
has
taught
them
that
the
attack
is
many
times
more
likely
to
be
cancelled
than
to
occur
until
it
actually
does
happen
they
will
not
believe
in
it
they
make
all
proper
preparations
but
quite
rightly
do
not
move
a
muscle
we
however
were
now
to
have
our
first
illustration
of
this
great
military
truth
for
indeed
we
were
to
have
no
battle
yet
that
night
march
to
the
trenches
was
an
experience
that
made
full
compensation
it
was
already
dusk
when
we
moved
out
of
the
and
the
moon
was
not
up
as
usual
in
new
units
the
leading
platoons
went
off
at
a
reckless
canter
and
stumbling
after
them
in
the
gathering
shadows
over
rocky
precipitous
slopes
and
in
and
out
of
the
clumps
of
bush
falling
in
dark
holes
on
to
indignant
sleepers
or
maddeningly
entangled
in
hidden
strands
of
wire
the
rear
companies
were
speedily
out
of
touch
to
a
heavily
laden
infantryman
there
are
few
things
more
exasperating
than
a
night
march
into
the
line
conducted
too
fast
if
the
country
be
broken
and
strewn
with
obstacles
at
which
each
man
must
wait
while
another
climbs
or
drops
or
wrestles
or
wades
in
front
of
him
and
must
then
laboriously
scamper
after
him
in
the
shadows
lest
he
and
thereby
all
those
behind
him
be
lost
if
the
country
be
unknown
to
him
so
that
apart
from
purely
military
considerations
the
fear
of
being
lost
is
no
small
thing
for
a
man
knows
that
he
may
wander
all
night
alone
in
the
dark
surrounded
by
unknown
dangers
cut
off
from
sleep
and
rations
and
the
friendly
voices
of
companions
a
jest
among
them
when
he
discovers
them
then
such
a
march
becomes
a
nightmare
on
this
night
it
dawned
gradually
on
those
in
front
that
they
were
unaccompanied
save
by
the
platoon
and
a
long
halt
and
much
shouting
and
searching
gathered
most
of
the
regiment
together
hot
cursing
and
already
exhausted
and
now
we
passed
the
five
white
water
towers
standing
mysteriously
in
a
swamp
and
came
out
of
the
open
country
into
the
beginning
of
a
gully
these
were
deep
ravines
driven
through
all
the
lower
slopes
of
achi
baba
and
carrying
in
the
spring
a
thin
stream
of
water
peopled
by
many
frogs
down
to
the
straits
or
the
sea
it
was
easier
going
here
for
there
was
a
rough
track
beside
the
stream
to
follow
yet
though
those
in
front
were
marching
as
they
thought
with
inconceivable
deliberation
the
rear
men
of
each
platoon
were
doubling
round
the
corners
among
the
trees
and
cursing
as
they
ran
there
was
then
a
wild
hail
of
bullets
in
all
those
gullies
since
for
many
hours
of
each
night
the
turk
kept
up
a
sustained
and
terrible
rapid
fire
from
his
trenches
far
up
the
hill
and
whether
by
design
or
bad
shooting
the
majority
of
these
bullets
passed
high
over
our
trenches
and
fell
hissing
in
the
so
now
all
the
air
seemed
full
of
the
humming
whistling
things
and
all
round
in
the
and
the
bushes
by
the
stream
there
were
vicious
spurts
as
they
fell
it
was
always
a
marvel
how
few
casualties
were
caused
by
this
stray
fire
and
we
were
chiefly
impressed
with
this
wonder
in
the
stream
the
frogs
croaked
incessantly
with
a
note
of
weary
indifference
to
the
medley
of
competing
noises
at
one
point
there
was
a
kind
of
in
the
stream
where
the
water
squeezing
through
made
a
kind
of
wail
delivered
with
stabbing
emphasis
at
regular
intervals
so
weird
was
this
sound
which
could
be
heard
many
hundred
yards
away
and
gradually
asserted
itself
above
all
other
contributions
to
that
terrible
din
that
many
of
the
men
already
mystified
and
excited
said
to
themselves
that
this
was
the
noise
of
the
hideous
explosive
bullets
of
which
they
had
heard
soon
we
were
compelled
to
climb
out
of
the
to
make
way
for
some
descending
troops
and
stumbled
forward
with
a
curious
feeling
of
nakedness
high
up
in
open
ground
here
the
bullets
were
many
times
multiplied
and
many
of
us
said
that
we
could
feel
them
passing
between
us
indeed
one
or
two
men
were
hit
but
though
we
did
not
know
it
most
of
these
bullets
flew
high
above
us
after
a
little
we
were
halted
and
lay
down
wondering
in
the
sibilant
dark
then
we
moved
on
and
halted
again
and
realized
suddenly
that
we
were
very
tired
at
the
head
of
the
column
the
guide
had
lost
his
way
and
could
not
find
the
entrance
to
the
communication
trench
and
here
in
the
most
exposed
area
of
all
that
peninsula
we
must
wait
until
he
did
the
march
was
an
avoidable
piece
of
mismanagement
the
whole
regiment
was
being
unnecessarily
endangered
but
none
of
this
we
knew
so
very
few
men
were
afraid
for
we
were
still
in
the
bliss
of
ignorance
it
seemed
to
us
that
these
strange
proceedings
must
be
a
part
of
the
everyday
life
of
the
soldier
if
they
were
not
we
raw
creatures
should
not
have
been
asked
to
endure
them
we
had
no
standard
of
safety
or
danger
by
which
to
estimate
our
position
and
so
the
miraculous
immunity
we
were
enjoying
was
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
and
we
were
blissfully
unafraid
at
the
same
time
we
were
extremely
bored
and
tired
and
the
sweat
cooled
on
us
in
the
chill
night
air
and
when
at
last
we
came
into
the
deep
communication
trench
we
felt
that
the
end
of
this
weariness
must
surely
be
near
but
the
worst
exasperations
of
relieving
an
unknown
line
were
still
before
us
it
was
a
trudge
in
the
narrow
ditches
to
the
front
line
no
war
correspondent
has
ever
described
such
a
march
it
is
not
included
in
the
official
of
war
but
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
which
more
than
battle
and
blood
harasses
the
spirit
of
the
infantryman
and
composes
his
life
the
communication
trenches
that
night
were
good
and
deep
and
dry
and
free
from
the
awfulness
of
mud
but
they
were
very
few
and
unintelligently
used
there
had
been
an
attack
that
day
and
coming
by
the
same
trench
was
a
long
stream
of
stretchers
and
wounded
men
and
odd
parties
coming
to
fetch
water
from
the
well
and
whole
battalions
relieved
from
other
parts
of
the
line
our
men
had
been
sent
up
insanely
with
full
packs
for
a
man
so
equipped
to
pass
another
naked
in
the
narrow
ditch
would
have
been
difficult
when
all
those
that
he
meets
have
also
straps
and
hooks
and
excrescences
about
them
each
separate
encounter
means
heartbreaking
entanglements
and
squeezes
and
sudden
paroxysms
of
rage
that
night
we
stood
a
total
of
hours
hopelessly
jammed
in
the
suffocating
trench
with
other
troops
trying
to
get
down
a
man
stood
in
those
crushes
unable
to
sit
down
unable
to
lean
comfortably
against
the
wall
because
of
his
pack
unable
even
to
get
his
hand
to
his
and
quench
his
intolerable
thirst
unable
almost
to
breathe
for
the
hot
smell
of
herded
humanity
only
a
thin
ribbon
of
stars
overhead
remotely
roofing
his
prison
reminded
him
that
indeed
he
was
still
in
the
living
world
and
not
pursuing
some
hideous
nightmare
at
long
last
some
one
would
take
charge
of
the
situation
and
by
sheer
muscular
fighting
for
space
the
two
masses
would
be
extricated
then
one
moved
on
again
and
now
each
man
has
become
a
mere
lifeless
automaton
every
few
yards
there
is
a
wire
hanging
across
the
trench
at
the
height
of
a
man
eyes
and
he
runs
blindly
into
it
or
it
catches
in
the
of
his
rifle
painfully
he
removes
it
or
in
a
fit
of
fury
tears
the
wire
away
with
him
or
there
is
a
man
lying
in
a
corner
with
a
wounded
leg
crying
out
to
each
not
to
tread
on
him
or
a
stretcher
party
slowly
struggling
against
the
tide
mechanically
each
man
grapples
with
these
obstacles
mechanically
repeats
the
ceaseless
messages
that
are
passed
up
and
down
and
the
warning
party
up
to
those
behind
and
stumbles
on
he
is
only
conscious
of
the
dead
weight
of
his
load
and
the
braces
of
his
pack
biting
into
his
shoulders
of
his
thirst
and
the
sweat
of
his
body
and
the
longing
to
lie
down
and
sleep
when
we
halt
men
fall
into
a
doze
as
they
stand
and
curse
pitifully
when
they
are
urged
on
from
behind
we
reach
the
inhabited
part
of
the
line
and
the
obstacles
become
more
frequent
for
there
are
traverses
every
ten
yards
and
men
sleeping
on
the
floor
and
a
litter
of
rifles
and
scattered
equipment
for
ever
we
wind
round
the
endless
traverses
and
squeeze
past
the
endless
host
we
are
relieving
and
sometimes
the
parapet
is
low
or
broken
or
thin
or
there
is
a
dangerous
gap
and
we
are
told
to
keep
our
heads
down
and
dully
pass
back
the
message
so
that
it
reaches
men
meaninglessly
when
they
have
passed
the
or
are
still
far
from
it
all
the
time
there
is
a
wild
rattle
of
rapid
fire
from
the
turks
and
bullets
hammer
irritably
on
the
parapet
or
fly
singing
overhead
when
a
man
reached
his
destined
part
of
the
trench
that
night
there
were
still
long
minutes
of
exasperation
before
him
for
we
were
inexperienced
troops
and
first
of
all
the
men
crowded
in
too
far
together
and
must
turn
about
and
press
back
so
as
to
cover
the
whole
ground
to
be
garrisoned
then
they
would
flock
like
sad
sheep
too
far
in
the
opposite
direction
this
was
the
subaltern
bad
time
for
the
officer
must
squeeze
backwards
and
forwards
struggling
to
dispose
properly
his
own
sullen
platoon
and
it
was
hard
for
him
to
be
patient
with
their
stupidity
for
like
them
he
only
longed
to
fling
off
his
cursed
equipment
and
lie
down
and
sleep
for
ever
he
like
them
had
but
one
thought
that
if
there
were
to
be
no
release
from
the
hateful
burden
that
clung
to
his
back
and
cut
into
his
shoulders
and
ceaselessly
impeded
him
if
there
were
to
be
no
relief
for
his
thirst
and
the
urgent
aching
of
all
his
body
he
must
soon
sink
down
and
scream
iii
harry
platoon
was
settled
in
when
i
found
him
hidden
away
somewhere
in
the
third
reserve
line
he
had
conscientiously
posted
a
few
sentries
and
done
all
those
things
which
a
good
platoon
commander
should
do
and
was
lying
himself
in
a
sort
of
stupor
of
fatigue
physically
he
was
not
strong
rather
frail
in
fact
for
the
infantry
he
had
a
narrow
chest
and
slightly
round
shoulders
and
his
heart
would
not
have
passed
any
civilian
doctor
and
from
my
own
experience
i
knew
that
the
march
must
have
tried
him
terribly
but
a
little
rest
had
soothed
the
intense
nervous
irritation
whose
origins
i
have
tried
to
describe
and
his
spirit
was
as
sturdy
as
ever
he
struggled
to
his
feet
and
leaned
over
the
parados
with
me
the
moon
was
now
high
up
in
the
the
turks
had
ceased
their
rapid
fire
at
moonrise
and
now
an
immense
peace
wrapped
the
peninsula
we
were
high
up
on
the
centre
slopes
of
achi
baba
and
all
the
six
miles
which
other
men
had
conquered
lay
bathed
in
moonlight
below
us
far
away
at
the
cape
we
could
see
the
long
green
lights
of
the
hospital
ships
and
all
about
us
were
in
the
scrub
left
and
right
the
pale
parapets
of
trenches
crept
like
snakes
into
the
little
valleys
and
vanished
over
the
opposite
slopes
only
a
cruiser
off
shore
firing
lazily
at
long
intervals
disturbed
the
slumberous
stillness
no
better
sedative
could
have
been
desired
did
you
like
the
march
i
said
all
right
one
of
my
men
was
wounded
i
believe
but
i
did
see
him
right
i
said
i
thought
it
was
damned
awful
it
a
marvel
that
any
of
us
are
here
at
all
i
hear
a
company
still
adrift
as
it
is
anyhow
got
here
said
harry
a
wonderful
spot
this
is
and
look
at
those
damned
i
was
anxious
to
know
what
impression
the
night
had
made
on
harry
but
these
and
other
answers
gave
me
no
real
clue
i
had
a
suspicion
that
it
had
in
truth
considerably
distressed
him
but
any
such
effect
had
clearly
given
way
to
the
romantic
appeal
of
the
quiet
moon
i
too
was
enjoying
the
sense
of
peace
but
i
was
still
acutely
conscious
of
the
unpleasantness
of
the
night
proceedings
and
a
certain
envy
took
hold
of
me
at
this
youth
capacity
to
concentrate
on
the
attractive
shadow
of
distasteful
things
there
was
a
heavy
musty
smell
over
all
this
part
of
the
trench
the
smell
of
a
dead
turk
lying
just
over
the
parapet
and
it
occurred
to
me
maliciously
to
wake
harry
from
his
dreams
and
bring
home
to
him
the
reality
of
things
smell
you
got
here
harry
i
said
what
it
is
it
cactus
or
amaryllis
or
one
of
those
funny
plants
they
have
here
is
it
i
read
about
it
in
the
papers
this
was
too
much
a
dead
turk
i
told
him
with
a
wicked
anticipation
of
the
effect
i
should
produce
the
effect
however
was
not
what
i
expected
said
harry
with
obvious
elation
find
the
devil
forthwith
he
swarmed
over
the
parapet
full
of
life
again
nosed
about
till
he
found
the
reeking
thing
and
gazed
on
it
with
undisguised
interest
no
sign
of
horror
or
disgust
could
i
detect
in
him
yet
it
was
not
pure
ghoulishness
it
was
simply
the
boy
greed
for
experience
and
the
savour
of
adventure
anyhow
my
experiment
had
failed
and
i
found
that
i
was
glad
but
when
i
was
leaving
him
for
the
next
platoon
he
was
lying
down
for
a
little
sleep
on
the
dirty
floor
of
the
trench
and
as
he
flashed
his
electric
torch
over
the
ground
i
saw
several
small
white
objects
writhing
in
the
dust
the
company
commander
whom
we
had
relieved
had
told
me
how
under
all
these
trenches
the
turks
and
the
french
had
buried
many
of
their
dead
and
in
a
moment
of
nauseating
insight
i
knew
that
these
things
were
the
maggots
which
fed
upon
their
bodies
i
said
ca
sleep
there
look
at
those
things
and
i
told
him
what
they
were
he
said
gone
to
sleep
well
then
i
left
him
but
that
how
he
was
in
those
days
iii
so
many
men
have
written
descriptions
of
trench
life
in
france
there
have
been
so
many
poems
plays
and
speeches
about
it
that
the
majority
of
our
nation
must
have
a
much
clearer
mental
picture
of
life
on
the
western
front
than
they
have
of
life
at
the
savoy
or
life
in
east
ham
but
the
gallipoli
peninsula
was
never
part
of
the
western
front
and
no
man
came
back
from
that
place
on
leave
lucky
indeed
if
he
came
at
all
the
campaign
was
never
for
obvious
reasons
an
important
item
in
official
propaganda
and
the
various
agencies
which
now
bring
home
the
war
to
streatham
had
not
begun
to
articulate
when
the
campaign
came
to
an
end
and
so
neither
streatham
nor
any
one
else
knew
anything
about
it
and
though
for
a
soldier
to
speak
however
distantly
of
the
details
of
trench
life
in
france
is
now
in
some
circles
considered
a
solecism
equivalent
to
the
talking
of
i
hope
i
may
still
without
offence
make
some
brief
reference
to
the
trenches
of
the
peninsula
for
in
truth
it
was
all
very
different
above
all
from
dawn
to
dawn
it
was
genuine
infantry
warfare
in
france
apart
from
attacks
an
infantryman
may
live
for
many
months
without
once
firing
his
rifle
or
running
the
remotest
risk
of
death
by
a
rifle
bullet
patiently
he
tramps
and
watches
and
digs
and
is
shelled
clinging
fondly
to
his
rifle
night
and
day
but
seldom
or
never
in
a
position
to
use
it
so
that
in
the
stagnant
days
of
the
past
he
came
to
look
upon
it
as
a
mere
part
of
his
equipment
like
his
only
heavier
and
less
comforting
and
in
real
emergencies
fumbled
stupidly
with
the
unfamiliar
mechanism
this
was
true
for
a
long
time
of
the
normal
or
sectors
of
france
but
in
those
of
gallipoli
the
turk
and
the
gentile
fought
with
each
other
all
day
with
rifle
and
bomb
and
in
the
evening
crept
out
and
stabbed
each
other
in
the
dark
there
was
no
release
from
the
strain
of
watching
and
listening
and
taking
thought
the
turk
was
always
on
higher
ground
he
knew
every
inch
of
all
those
valleys
and
vineyards
and
slopes
and
he
had
an
uncanny
accuracy
of
aim
moreover
many
of
his
men
had
the
devotion
of
fanatics
which
inspired
them
to
lie
out
behind
our
lines
with
stores
of
food
enough
to
last
out
their
ammunition
certain
only
of
their
own
ultimate
destruction
but
content
to
lie
there
and
pick
off
the
infidels
till
they
too
died
they
were
very
brave
men
but
the
turkish
snipers
were
not
confined
to
the
madmen
who
were
caught
disguised
as
trees
in
the
broad
daylight
and
found
their
way
into
the
picture
papers
every
trench
was
full
of
snipers
less
theatrical
but
no
less
effective
and
in
the
night
they
crept
out
with
unbelievable
stealth
and
lay
close
in
to
our
lines
killing
our
sentries
and
chipping
away
our
crumbling
parapets
so
the
sniping
was
terrible
in
that
first
week
we
lost
twelve
men
each
day
they
fell
without
a
sound
in
the
early
morning
as
they
stood
up
from
their
cooking
at
the
brazier
fell
shot
through
the
head
and
lay
snoring
horribly
in
the
dust
they
were
sniped
as
they
came
up
the
communication
trench
with
water
or
carelessly
raised
their
heads
to
look
back
at
the
ships
in
the
bay
and
in
the
night
there
were
sudden
screams
where
a
sentry
had
moved
his
head
too
often
against
the
moon
if
a
periscope
were
raised
however
furtively
it
was
shivered
in
an
instant
if
a
man
peered
over
himself
he
was
dead
far
back
in
the
reserve
lines
or
at
the
wells
where
a
man
thought
himself
hidden
from
view
the
sniper
saw
and
killed
him
all
along
the
line
were
where
many
had
been
hit
these
places
became
invested
with
a
peculiar
awe
and
as
you
came
to
them
the
men
said
low
here
sir
in
a
mysterious
whisper
as
though
the
turk
could
hear
them
indeed
so
uncanny
were
many
of
the
deaths
that
some
men
said
the
turk
could
see
impossibly
through
the
walls
of
the
trench
and
crouched
nervously
in
the
bottom
all
the
long
communication
trenches
were
watched
and
wherever
a
head
or
a
moving
rifle
showed
at
a
gap
a
bullet
came
with
automatic
regularity
going
down
a
alone
a
man
would
hear
the
tap
of
these
bullets
on
the
parapet
following
him
along
and
break
into
a
run
in
the
bright
sunlight
to
get
away
from
this
unnatural
pursuit
for
such
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
fire
seemed
to
come
from
all
angles
and
units
bitterly
accused
their
neighbours
of
killing
their
men
when
it
seemed
impossible
that
any
turk
could
have
fired
the
shot
for
a
little
then
this
sniping
was
thoroughly
on
the
men
nerves
nothing
in
their
training
had
prepared
them
for
it
they
hated
the
feeling
it
produced
it
was
demoralizing
always
to
be
wondering
if
one
head
was
low
enough
always
to
walk
with
a
stoop
it
was
tiring
to
be
always
taking
care
and
it
was
very
dangerous
to
relax
that
care
for
a
moment
something
had
to
be
done
and
the
heavy
methodical
way
in
which
these
tynesiders
of
ours
learned
to
counter
and
finally
overcome
the
sniper
is
characteristic
of
the
nation
effort
throughout
this
war
the
turks
were
natural
soldiers
fighting
in
their
own
country
more
they
were
natural
scouts
our
men
were
ponderous
uncouth
pitmen
from
tyneside
and
the
clyde
but
we
chose
out
a
small
body
of
them
who
could
shoot
better
than
their
fellows
and
called
them
snipers
and
behold
they
snipers
we
gave
them
telescopes
and
periscopes
and
observers
and
set
them
in
odd
corners
and
told
them
to
snipe
and
by
slow
degrees
they
became
interested
and
active
and
expert
and
killed
many
turks
the
third
time
we
came
to
those
trenches
we
could
move
about
with
comparative
freedom
in
all
this
harry
took
a
leading
part
for
the
battalion
scout
officer
was
one
of
the
first
casualties
and
harry
who
had
had
some
training
as
a
scout
in
the
ranks
was
appointed
in
his
place
in
this
capacity
he
was
in
charge
of
the
improvised
snipers
and
all
day
moved
about
the
line
from
post
to
post
encouraging
and
correcting
all
this
he
did
with
characteristic
energy
and
enthusiasm
and
tired
himself
out
with
long
wanderings
in
the
scorching
sun
in
those
trenches
all
movement
was
an
intense
labour
the
sun
blazed
always
into
the
suffocating
ditch
where
no
breath
of
air
came
the
men
not
on
duty
lay
huddled
wherever
they
could
steal
an
inch
of
shade
with
the
flies
crawling
about
their
eyes
and
open
mouths
progress
was
a
weary
routine
of
squeezing
past
men
or
stepping
over
men
or
running
into
men
round
corners
as
one
stooped
to
escape
death
in
little
niches
in
the
wall
were
boiling
over
fires
so
that
the
eyes
smarted
from
their
smoke
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
hot
fumes
and
everywhere
was
the
stuffy
smell
of
human
flesh
in
the
heat
of
the
day
these
things
produced
in
the
healthiest
man
an
intolerable
irritation
and
fatigue
to
a
frail
sensitive
youth
like
harry
his
rambles
must
have
been
torture
but
though
he
too
became
touchy
he
pursued
his
task
with
determination
and
would
not
be
tempted
away
the
rest
of
us
when
not
on
watch
lay
torpid
all
the
hot
hours
in
the
shallow
holes
we
had
scratched
behind
the
trench
and
called
company
headquarters
these
places
were
roofed
only
with
the
inevitable
waterproof
sheet
and
had
there
been
any
serious
shelling
would
have
been
into
these
dwellings
came
many
strange
animals
driven
from
their
nests
among
the
roots
of
the
scrub
snakes
lizards
and
hideous
centipedes
large
clumsy
winged
things
which
some
said
were
locusts
fell
into
the
trench
and
for
a
few
hours
strove
vainly
to
leap
out
again
till
they
were
trampled
to
death
they
had
the
colour
of
ivory
and
shone
with
bright
tints
in
the
sun
like
shot
silk
the
men
found
tortoises
derelict
in
near
and
set
them
to
walk
in
the
trench
and
they
too
wandered
sadly
about
till
they
disappeared
no
man
knew
where
the
flies
were
not
yet
at
full
strength
but
they
were
very
bad
and
all
day
we
wrestled
with
thirst
he
was
a
lucky
man
who
could
sleep
in
the
daylight
hours
and
when
the
cool
evening
came
beckoning
him
to
sleep
he
must
rise
and
bestir
himself
for
the
work
of
the
night
then
all
the
line
stirred
with
life
again
with
the
cleaning
of
rifles
thick
with
heavy
dust
and
the
bustle
of
men
making
ready
to
to
arms
now
indeed
could
a
man
have
slept
when
all
the
pests
of
the
day
had
been
exorcized
by
the
cool
dusk
and
the
bitter
cold
of
the
midnight
was
not
yet
come
but
there
was
no
sleep
for
any
man
only
watching
and
digging
and
carrying
and
working
and
listening
and
so
soon
as
achi
baba
was
swathed
in
shadow
and
the
sun
well
down
behind
the
westward
islands
the
turk
began
his
evening
fusillade
of
rapid
fire
this
was
an
astonishing
performance
night
after
night
at
this
hour
every
man
in
his
trench
must
have
blazed
away
till
his
rifle
would
do
its
work
no
more
fire
has
been
a
speciality
of
the
turkish
infantryman
since
the
days
of
plevna
and
indeed
he
excels
in
it
few
english
units
could
equal
his
performance
for
ten
minutes
but
the
turk
kept
up
the
same
sustained
deafening
volume
of
fire
for
hours
at
a
stretch
till
the
moon
came
up
and
allayed
his
fears
for
it
was
an
exhibition
of
nervousness
as
well
as
musketry
fearful
of
a
stealthy
assault
in
the
dark
he
would
not
desist
till
he
could
see
well
across
his
own
wire
captured
orders
by
the
turkish
high
command
repeatedly
forbade
this
reckless
expenditure
of
ammunition
and
sometimes
for
two
nights
he
would
restrain
himself
but
in
the
early
days
never
for
more
our
policy
was
to
lie
down
in
the
trench
and
think
sardonically
of
the
ammunition
he
was
wasting
but
even
this
was
not
good
for
men
minds
most
of
the
fire
was
high
and
whizzed
over
into
the
gullies
but
many
hundreds
of
all
those
thousands
of
bullets
hit
the
parapet
there
was
a
steady
reiterant
rap
of
them
on
the
very
irritating
to
the
nerves
and
bits
of
the
parapet
splashed
viciously
into
the
trench
over
the
crouching
men
in
that
tornado
of
sound
a
man
must
shout
to
make
himself
heard
by
his
friends
and
this
produced
in
his
mind
an
uncomfortable
sense
of
isolation
he
seemed
cut
off
from
humanity
and
brooded
secretly
to
himself
safe
he
might
be
in
that
trench
but
he
could
not
long
sit
alone
in
that
tempestuous
security
without
imagining
himself
in
other
circumstances
climbing
up
the
parapet
leaving
the
trench
walking
into
that
so
on
the
few
murky
nights
when
the
moon
would
not
show
herself
but
peeped
temptingly
from
behind
large
bolsters
of
cloud
so
that
even
the
turks
diminished
their
fire
and
then
with
a
petulant
crescendo
continued
men
lay
in
the
dust
and
prayed
for
the
moon
to
come
so
demoralizing
was
this
fire
that
it
was
not
easy
to
induce
even
sentries
to
keep
an
effective
watch
not
unnaturally
they
did
not
like
lifting
their
heads
to
look
over
even
for
the
periodical
peeps
which
were
insisted
upon
an
officer
on
his
rounds
would
find
them
standing
on
the
firestep
with
their
heads
well
below
the
parapet
but
gazing
intently
into
the
heart
of
a
with
the
air
of
a
man
whom
no
movement
of
the
enemy
can
escape
the
officer
must
then
perform
the
melancholy
rite
of
the
man
how
safe
it
is
this
consisted
in
climbing
up
to
the
firestep
and
exposing
an
immoderate
amount
of
his
head
gazing
deliberately
at
the
turks
and
striving
to
create
an
impression
of
indifference
and
calm
he
then
jumped
down
shouting
cheerily
the
way
thompson
and
walked
off
thanking
god
personally
i
did
not
like
this
duty
at
the
best
it
was
an
hypocrisy
for
the
reluctance
of
the
officer
to
look
over
was
no
less
acute
than
the
man
and
it
was
one
thing
to
look
for
a
moment
or
two
and
pass
on
and
another
to
stand
there
and
repeat
the
process
at
brief
intervals
officers
performed
this
rite
according
to
their
several
characters
eustace
for
example
with
a
cynical
grin
which
derided
with
equal
injustice
both
himself
and
his
action
he
was
notably
courageous
and
his
nonchalance
on
the
parapet
would
have
been
definitely
reassuring
to
the
nervous
sentry
but
his
expression
and
attitude
said
clearly
is
all
damned
nonsense
my
good
man
do
like
standing
up
here
neither
do
i
and
neither
of
us
is
deceiving
the
other
at
all
burnett
did
it
with
genuine
and
distaste
too
hasty
to
be
convincing
harry
alone
did
it
with
a
gallant
abandon
like
a
knight
throwing
down
his
challenge
to
the
enemy
and
he
alone
can
have
been
really
inspiring
to
the
reluctant
sentry
he
had
a
keen
dramatic
instinct
and
in
these
little
scenes
rather
enjoyed
the
part
of
the
unperturbed
hero
calming
the
timorous
herd
watching
him
once
or
twice
i
wondered
how
much
was
acting
and
how
much
real
fearlessness
if
it
was
acting
he
was
braver
then
than
most
of
us
but
i
think
it
was
the
other
just
then
there
were
five
or
six
hours
between
the
end
of
the
rapid
fire
and
the
to
before
dawn
during
these
hours
three
of
the
company
officers
were
always
on
duty
we
split
the
time
in
two
and
it
was
a
weary
three
hours
patrolling
the
still
trench
stumbling
over
sleeping
men
sprawled
out
like
dead
in
the
moonlight
and
goading
the
tired
sentries
to
watchfulness
terrible
was
the
want
of
sleep
the
men
fell
asleep
with
their
heads
against
the
iron
loopholes
and
starting
up
as
the
officer
shook
them
swore
that
they
had
never
nodded
only
by
constant
movement
could
the
officer
be
sure
even
of
himself
he
dared
not
sit
for
a
moment
or
lean
in
the
corner
of
the
traverse
though
all
his
limbs
ached
for
rest
lest
he
too
be
found
snoring
at
his
post
and
he
and
all
his
men
be
butchered
in
their
guilty
sleep
and
so
he
drags
his
sore
feet
ceaselessly
backwards
and
forwards
marvelling
at
the
stillness
and
the
stars
and
the
strange
musky
night
smell
which
has
crept
out
of
the
earth
far
away
he
can
see
the
green
lights
of
a
hospital
ship
and
as
he
looks
they
begin
to
move
and
dwindle
slowly
into
the
distance
for
she
is
going
home
and
he
thinks
of
the
warmth
and
light
and
comfort
in
that
ship
and
follows
her
wistfully
with
his
eyes
till
she
is
gone
turning
back
he
sees
a
sentry
silent
above
him
he
too
is
watching
the
ship
and
each
man
knows
the
other
thoughts
but
they
do
not
speak
at
last
comes
the
officer
relieving
him
cold
and
irritable
from
his
brief
sleep
he
is
a
little
late
and
they
compare
watches
resentfully
and
unless
they
be
firm
friends
at
that
moment
they
hate
each
other
but
the
one
who
is
relieved
goes
down
to
the
in
the
support
line
a
little
jauntily
now
though
his
feet
are
painful
feeling
already
that
he
could
watch
many
hours
more
and
suddenly
the
moon
is
beautiful
and
the
stars
are
friendly
for
he
is
going
to
sleep
but
when
he
comes
to
the
little
narrow
hole
which
is
the
there
are
two
officers
already
filling
most
of
the
floor
noisily
asleep
one
of
them
is
lying
on
his
waterproof
sheet
he
tugs
angrily
at
it
but
it
is
caught
in
something
and
will
not
come
away
he
shakes
the
man
but
he
does
not
wake
too
tired
to
continue
he
lies
down
awkwardly
in
the
crooked
space
which
is
left
between
the
legs
and
arms
and
equipment
of
the
others
he
draws
his
meagre
over
his
body
and
pulls
his
knees
up
that
they
too
may
be
covered
there
is
nothing
over
his
feet
and
already
they
are
cold
his
head
he
rests
on
a
rough
army
haversack
in
the
middle
of
it
there
is
a
hard
knob
a
or
a
book
or
a
tin
of
beef
for
a
little
he
lies
uncomfortably
like
this
hoping
for
sleep
his
ear
is
crushed
on
the
hard
pillow
there
is
something
knobbly
under
his
hip
he
knows
that
he
ought
to
get
up
and
himself
but
he
lacks
the
necessary
energy
finally
he
raises
himself
on
his
elbow
and
tugs
at
the
towel
in
his
haversack
to
make
him
a
pillow
the
strap
of
the
haversack
is
fastened
and
the
towel
will
not
emerge
he
unfastens
the
haversack
and
in
desperation
pulls
out
the
whole
of
its
contents
with
the
towel
his
toothbrush
and
his
sponge
and
his
diary
are
scattered
in
the
dust
some
of
the
pages
of
the
diary
are
loose
and
if
he
leaves
it
they
will
be
lost
he
feels
in
the
darkness
for
his
electric
torch
and
curses
because
he
can
not
find
it
he
has
lent
it
to
the
damned
fool
who
relieved
him
why
ca
people
have
things
of
their
own
painfully
groping
he
gathers
his
belongings
and
puts
them
one
by
one
in
the
haversack
arranging
his
towel
on
the
top
his
elbow
is
sore
with
leaning
on
it
but
the
pillow
is
ready
lying
down
again
he
falls
quickly
to
sleep
almost
at
once
there
is
a
wild
din
in
his
dreams
rapid
fire
again
springing
up
he
rushes
into
the
trench
with
the
others
it
is
an
attack
who
is
attacking
the
men
in
the
trench
know
nothing
it
started
on
the
right
they
say
and
now
the
whole
line
is
ablaze
again
with
this
maddening
running
back
to
the
he
gropes
in
the
wreckage
of
coats
and
equipment
for
his
belt
and
revolver
he
must
hurry
to
the
front
line
to
take
charge
of
his
platoon
there
are
no
telephones
to
the
what
the
hell
is
happening
when
he
is
halfway
up
the
communication
trench
cannoning
into
the
walls
in
his
haste
and
weariness
the
firing
suddenly
stops
it
was
a
wild
panic
started
by
the
senegalese
holding
the
line
on
our
right
damn
them
black
idiots
he
goes
back
swearing
with
the
other
officers
and
they
lie
down
anyhow
it
is
too
late
now
to
waste
time
on
fussy
arrangements
when
he
wakes
up
again
there
is
already
a
hint
of
light
in
the
east
it
is
the
to
arms
before
dawn
his
feet
are
numb
and
painful
with
cold
his
limbs
are
cramped
and
aching
and
his
right
forearm
has
gone
to
sleep
the
flesh
of
his
legs
is
clammy
and
sticks
to
the
breeches
he
has
lived
and
slept
in
for
five
days
he
longs
for
a
bath
slowly
with
the
others
he
raises
himself
and
gropes
weakly
in
the
muddle
of
garments
on
the
floor
for
his
equipment
he
can
not
find
his
revolver
burnett
has
lost
his
belt
and
mutters
angrily
to
himself
all
their
belongings
are
entangled
together
in
the
narrow
space
they
disengage
them
without
speaking
to
each
other
each
one
is
in
a
dull
coma
of
endurance
for
the
moment
their
spirit
is
at
its
lowest
ebb
it
is
the
most
awful
moment
of
warfare
in
a
little
they
will
revive
but
just
now
they
can
not
pretend
to
bravery
or
cheerfulness
only
curse
feebly
and
fumble
in
the
darkness
they
go
out
into
the
trench
and
join
their
platoons
the
are
still
shaking
and
bullying
the
men
still
asleep
some
of
these
are
almost
senseless
and
can
only
be
roused
by
prolonged
physical
violence
the
officer
braces
himself
for
his
duties
and
by
and
by
all
the
men
are
more
or
less
awake
and
equipped
though
their
heads
droop
as
they
sit
and
their
neighbours
nudge
them
into
wakefulness
as
the
officer
approaches
mechanically
he
fills
and
lights
a
pipe
and
takes
a
cautious
sip
at
his
the
pipe
turns
his
empty
stomach
and
an
intolerable
emptiness
assails
him
he
knocks
out
the
pipe
and
peers
over
the
parapet
it
is
almost
light
now
but
a
thin
mist
hides
the
turkish
trench
his
face
is
greasy
and
taut
with
dirt
and
the
corners
of
his
eyes
are
full
of
dust
his
throat
is
dry
and
there
is
a
loathsome
stubble
on
his
chin
which
he
fingers
absently
pulling
at
the
long
hairs
steadily
the
light
grows
and
grows
and
the
men
begin
to
chatter
and
suddenly
the
sun
emerges
over
the
corner
of
achi
baba
and
life
and
warmth
come
back
to
the
numb
souls
of
all
these
men
to
is
over
but
as
the
men
tear
off
their
hateful
equipment
and
lean
their
rifles
against
the
wall
of
the
trench
there
is
a
sudden
burst
of
shelling
on
the
right
figures
appear
running
on
the
skyline
they
are
against
the
light
and
the
shapes
are
dark
but
there
seems
to
be
a
dirty
blue
in
their
uniforms
no
one
quite
knows
how
the
line
runs
up
there
it
is
a
salient
the
figures
must
be
turks
attacking
the
french
the
men
gape
over
the
parapet
the
officer
gapes
it
is
nothing
to
do
with
them
then
he
remembers
what
he
is
for
and
tells
his
men
excitedly
to
fire
on
the
figures
some
of
the
men
have
begun
cooking
their
breakfast
and
are
with
difficulty
seduced
from
their
task
a
spasmodic
fire
opens
on
the
running
figures
it
is
hard
to
say
where
they
are
running
or
what
they
are
doing
the
officer
is
puzzled
it
is
his
first
glimpse
of
battle
and
he
feels
that
a
battle
should
be
simple
and
easy
to
understand
the
officer
of
the
next
platoon
comes
along
he
is
equally
ignorant
of
affairs
but
he
thinks
the
figures
are
french
attacking
the
turks
they
too
wear
blue
the
first
officer
rushes
down
the
line
telling
the
men
to
fire
the
men
growl
and
go
back
to
their
cooking
it
is
fairly
certain
that
none
of
them
hit
any
of
the
distant
figures
but
the
officer
is
worried
why
was
nobody
told
what
was
to
happen
what
is
it
all
about
he
has
been
put
in
a
false
position
presently
a
belated
chit
arrives
to
say
that
the
french
were
to
attack
at
sunrise
but
the
attack
was
a
fiasco
and
is
postponed
and
now
all
the
air
is
sickly
with
the
smell
of
cooking
and
the
dry
wood
crackles
in
every
corner
little
wisps
of
smoke
go
straight
up
in
the
still
air
all
the
peninsula
is
beautiful
in
the
sunlight
and
wonderful
to
look
upon
against
the
dark
blue
of
the
sea
the
dew
sparkles
on
the
scrub
over
the
cypress
grove
comes
the
first
aeroplane
humming
contentedly
another
day
has
begun
the
officer
goes
down
whistling
to
wash
in
a
bucket
iv
such
was
life
in
the
line
at
that
time
but
i
should
make
the
almost
automatic
reservation
that
it
might
have
been
worse
there
might
have
been
heavy
shelling
but
the
shelling
on
the
trenches
was
negligible
then
there
might
have
been
mud
but
there
was
not
and
eight
such
days
might
have
left
harry
penrose
quite
unaffected
in
spirit
in
spite
of
his
physical
handicaps
by
reason
of
his
extraordinary
vitality
and
zest
but
there
were
two
incidents
before
we
went
down
which
did
affect
him
and
it
is
necessary
that
they
should
be
told
on
the
fifth
day
in
the
line
he
did
a
very
brave
thing
brave
at
least
in
the
popular
sense
which
means
that
many
another
man
would
not
have
done
that
thing
to
my
mind
a
man
is
brave
only
in
proportion
to
his
knowledge
and
his
susceptibility
to
fear
the
standard
of
the
mob
the
standard
of
the
official
military
mind
is
absolute
there
are
no
fine
shades
no
account
of
circumstance
and
temperament
is
allowed
and
perhaps
this
is
inevitable
most
men
would
say
that
harry
deed
was
a
brave
one
i
have
said
so
myself
but
i
am
not
sure
eighty
to
a
hundred
yards
from
one
section
of
our
line
was
a
small
stretch
of
turkish
trench
considerably
in
advance
of
their
main
line
from
this
trench
a
particularly
harassing
fire
was
kept
up
night
and
day
and
the
brigade
staff
considered
that
it
should
be
captured
high
officers
in
shirt
sleeves
and
red
hats
looked
long
and
wisely
at
it
through
periscopes
colonels
and
adjutants
and
subalterns
and
sergeants
stood
silent
and
respectful
while
the
great
men
pondered
the
great
men
then
turned
round
with
the
air
of
those
who
make
profound
decisions
and
announced
that
ought
to
be
able
to
enfilade
it
from
over
there
or
suppose
they
enfilade
you
from
there
the
term
invariably
occurred
somewhere
in
these
dicta
and
in
the
listeners
minds
there
stirred
the
suspicion
that
the
great
ones
had
not
been
looking
at
the
right
trench
if
indeed
they
had
focused
the
unfamiliar
instrument
so
as
to
see
anything
at
all
but
the
decision
was
made
and
for
the
purposes
of
a
night
attack
it
was
important
to
know
whether
the
trench
was
held
strongly
at
night
or
occupied
only
by
a
few
busy
snipers
harry
was
ordered
to
reconnoitre
the
trench
with
two
scouts
the
night
was
pitch
black
with
an
unusual
absence
of
stars
the
worst
of
the
rapid
fire
was
over
but
there
was
a
steady
spit
and
crackle
of
bullets
from
the
turks
and
especially
from
the
little
trench
opposite
long
afterwards
in
france
he
told
me
that
he
would
never
again
dream
of
going
out
on
patrol
in
the
face
of
such
a
fire
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
delay
his
expedition
the
profession
of
scouting
made
a
special
appeal
to
the
romantic
side
of
him
the
prospect
of
some
real
practical
scouting
was
exciting
according
to
the
books
much
scouting
was
done
under
heavy
fire
but
according
to
the
books
and
in
the
absence
of
any
experience
to
the
contrary
it
was
probable
that
the
careful
scout
would
not
be
killed
then
why
waste
time
all
this
i
gathered
indirectly
from
his
account
of
the
affair
two
bullets
smacked
into
the
parapet
by
his
head
as
he
climbed
out
of
the
dark
sap
and
wriggled
forward
into
the
scrub
but
even
these
did
not
give
him
pause
only
while
he
lay
and
waited
for
the
two
men
to
follow
did
he
begin
to
realize
how
many
bullets
were
flying
about
the
fire
was
now
really
heavy
and
when
i
heard
that
harry
had
gone
out
i
was
afraid
but
he
as
yet
was
only
faintly
surprised
the
colonel
had
sent
him
out
the
colonel
had
said
the
turks
fired
high
and
if
you
kept
low
you
were
quite
safe
and
he
ought
to
know
this
was
a
regular
thing
in
warfare
and
must
be
done
so
on
like
reptiles
into
the
darkness
dragging
with
hands
and
pushing
with
knees
progress
in
the
orthodox
scout
fashion
was
surprisingly
slow
and
exhausting
the
scrub
tickled
and
scratched
your
face
the
revolver
in
your
hands
caught
in
the
roots
the
barrel
must
be
choked
with
dust
moreover
it
was
impossible
to
see
anything
at
all
and
the
object
of
a
reconnaissance
being
to
see
something
this
was
perplexing
even
when
the
frequent
flares
went
up
and
one
lay
pressed
to
the
earth
one
horizon
was
the
edge
of
a
tuft
of
scrub
five
yards
away
this
always
looked
like
the
summit
of
some
commanding
height
but
labouring
thither
one
saw
by
the
next
flare
only
another
exactly
similar
horizon
beyond
so
must
the
worm
feel
wandering
in
the
rugged
spaces
of
a
lawn
it
was
long
before
harry
properly
understood
this
phenomenon
and
by
then
his
neck
was
stiff
and
aching
from
lying
flat
and
craning
his
head
back
to
see
in
front
but
after
many
hours
of
crawling
the
ground
sloped
down
a
little
and
now
they
could
see
the
sharp
stabbing
flashes
from
the
rifles
of
the
snipers
in
the
little
trench
ahead
of
them
clearly
they
were
only
snipers
for
the
flashes
came
from
only
eight
or
nine
particular
spots
spaced
out
at
intervals
the
scouts
glowed
with
the
sense
of
achievement
as
they
watched
they
had
found
out
never
again
could
harry
have
lain
like
that
naked
in
the
face
of
those
near
rifles
coldly
calculating
and
watching
without
an
effort
of
real
heroism
on
this
night
he
did
it
easily
confident
unafraid
elated
with
his
little
success
something
prompted
him
to
go
farther
and
confirm
his
deductions
he
whispered
to
his
men
to
lie
down
in
a
fold
of
the
ground
and
crept
forward
to
the
very
trench
itself
aiming
at
a
point
midway
between
two
flashes
there
was
no
wire
in
front
of
the
trench
but
as
he
saw
the
parapet
looming
like
a
mountain
close
ahead
he
began
to
realize
what
a
mad
fool
he
was
alone
and
helpless
within
a
yard
of
the
turks
an
easy
mark
in
the
light
of
the
next
flare
but
he
would
not
go
back
and
squirming
on
worked
his
head
into
a
gap
in
the
parapet
and
gazed
into
a
vast
blackness
this
he
did
with
a
wild
incautiousness
the
patience
of
the
true
scout
overcome
by
his
anxiety
to
do
what
he
intended
as
soon
as
possible
the
own
rifles
had
drowned
the
noise
of
his
movements
and
providentially
no
flare
went
up
till
his
body
was
against
the
parapet
when
at
length
the
faint
wavering
light
began
and
swelled
into
sudden
brilliance
he
could
see
right
into
the
trench
and
when
the
shadows
chased
each
other
back
into
its
depths
as
the
light
fell
he
lay
marvelling
at
his
own
audacity
so
impressed
was
he
by
the
wonder
of
his
exploit
that
he
was
incapable
of
making
any
intelligent
observations
other
than
the
bald
fact
that
there
were
no
men
in
that
part
of
the
trench
he
was
still
waiting
for
another
flare
when
there
was
a
burst
of
rapid
fire
from
our
own
line
a
little
to
the
right
suddenly
he
realized
that
b
company
not
know
he
was
c
company
knew
but
in
his
haste
he
had
forgotten
to
see
that
the
others
were
informed
before
he
left
as
he
had
arranged
to
do
with
the
colonel
he
and
his
scouts
would
be
shot
by
b
company
obsessed
with
this
thought
he
turned
and
scrambled
breathlessly
back
to
the
two
waiting
men
god
knows
why
he
was
seen
and
sniped
and
his
retirement
must
have
been
very
noisy
for
as
he
reached
the
others
all
the
snipers
in
the
trench
opened
fire
feverishly
together
harry
and
his
men
who
were
cold
with
waiting
wriggled
blindly
back
they
no
longer
pretended
to
any
deliberation
or
cunning
but
having
come
to
no
harm
so
far
were
not
seriously
anxious
about
themselves
only
it
seemed
good
to
go
back
now
but
after
a
few
yards
one
of
the
men
trower
gave
a
scream
of
agony
and
cried
out
hit
i
hit
in
that
moment
harry
told
me
all
the
elation
and
pride
of
his
exploit
ebbed
out
of
him
a
sick
disgust
with
himself
and
everything
came
over
him
williams
the
other
scout
lay
between
him
and
trower
who
was
now
moaning
horribly
in
the
darkness
for
a
moment
harry
was
paralysed
he
lay
there
saying
feebly
are
you
hit
where
is
he
hit
williams
where
are
you
hit
when
at
last
he
got
to
his
side
the
man
was
almost
unconscious
with
pain
but
he
had
managed
to
screech
out
legs
in
fact
he
had
been
shot
through
the
femoral
artery
and
one
leg
was
broken
in
that
blackness
skilled
hands
would
have
had
difficulty
in
bandaging
any
wound
harry
and
williams
could
not
even
tell
where
his
wound
was
for
all
his
legs
were
wet
and
sticky
with
blood
but
both
of
them
were
fumbling
and
scratching
at
their
for
some
moments
before
they
realized
this
then
they
started
to
take
the
man
in
half
dragging
half
carrying
him
at
every
movement
the
man
shrieked
in
agony
when
they
stood
up
to
carry
him
bodily
he
screamed
so
piercingly
that
the
storm
of
bullets
was
immediately
doubled
about
them
when
they
lay
down
and
dragged
him
he
screamed
less
but
progress
was
impossibly
slow
and
now
it
seemed
that
there
were
turks
in
the
open
scrub
about
them
for
there
were
flashes
and
loud
reports
at
strangely
close
quarters
the
turks
could
not
see
the
miserable
little
party
but
trower
screams
were
an
easy
guide
then
harry
bethought
him
of
the
little
medical
case
in
his
where
with
needles
and
aspirin
and
plaster
and
pills
was
a
small
phial
of
morphine
tablets
for
trower
sake
and
their
own
his
screaming
must
be
stilled
tearing
open
his
pocket
he
fumbled
at
the
elastic
band
round
the
case
the
little
phial
was
smaller
than
the
rest
he
knew
where
it
lay
but
the
case
was
all
the
phials
seemed
the
same
size
trembling
he
pulled
out
the
cork
and
shook
out
one
of
the
tablets
into
his
hand
a
bullet
cracked
like
a
whip
over
his
head
the
tablet
fell
in
the
scrub
he
got
another
out
and
passed
it
over
to
williams
williams
hand
was
shaking
and
he
dropped
it
harry
groaned
the
next
two
were
safely
transferred
and
pressed
into
trower
mouth
he
did
not
know
how
strong
they
were
but
he
remembered
vaguely
seeing
or
two
on
the
label
and
at
that
black
moment
the
phrase
came
curiously
into
his
head
ordered
by
the
doctor
trower
was
quieter
now
and
this
made
the
other
two
a
little
calmer
harry
told
me
he
was
now
so
cool
that
he
could
put
the
phial
back
carefully
in
the
case
and
return
them
to
his
pocket
even
from
sheer
force
of
habit
he
buttoned
up
the
pocket
but
when
they
moved
off
they
realized
with
a
new
horror
that
they
were
lost
they
had
come
out
originally
from
the
head
of
a
long
sap
in
the
darkness
and
the
excitement
they
had
lost
all
sense
of
direction
and
had
missed
the
sap
probably
they
were
not
more
than
fifty
yards
from
friends
but
they
might
be
moving
parallel
to
the
sap
or
parallel
to
the
front
line
and
that
way
they
might
go
on
indefinitely
they
could
not
drag
their
wretched
burden
with
them
indefinitely
so
harry
sent
williams
to
find
the
trench
and
lay
throbbing
by
the
wounded
man
no
one
who
has
not
been
lost
in
the
pitchy
dark
in
no
man
land
can
understand
how
easy
it
is
to
arrive
at
that
condition
and
the
intense
feeling
of
helplessness
it
produces
that
solitary
wait
of
harry
must
have
been
terrible
for
he
had
time
now
to
ponder
his
position
perhaps
williams
would
not
find
the
trench
perhaps
he
too
would
be
hit
perhaps
he
would
not
be
able
to
find
the
scouts
again
what
should
they
do
then
anything
was
possible
in
this
awful
darkness
with
these
bullets
cracking
and
tearing
about
him
perhaps
he
would
be
killed
himself
straining
his
ears
he
fancied
he
could
hear
the
rustle
of
creeping
men
any
moment
he
expected
a
rending
blow
on
his
own
tender
body
but
his
revolver
had
been
dropped
in
the
dragging
of
trower
he
could
do
nothing
only
try
to
bind
up
the
poor
legs
again
poor
harry
as
he
lay
there
bandaging
his
scout
he
noticed
that
the
lad
had
stopped
moaning
and
said
to
himself
that
his
morphine
tablets
had
done
their
work
that
was
something
anyhow
but
the
man
was
already
dead
he
could
not
have
lived
for
ten
minutes
the
doctor
told
me
and
when
williams
at
last
returned
trailing
a
long
string
from
the
sap
it
was
a
dead
man
they
brought
painfully
into
the
trench
and
handed
over
gently
to
the
i
was
in
the
sap
when
they
came
and
dragged
harry
away
from
it
and
when
they
told
him
he
nearly
cried
ii
the
other
incident
is
briefly
told
on
our
last
day
in
the
line
platoon
were
working
stealthily
in
the
hot
sun
at
a
new
section
of
trench
connecting
two
saps
and
some
one
incautiously
threw
a
little
earth
over
the
parapet
the
turks
who
seldom
molested
any
of
the
regular
established
trenches
with
but
hotly
resented
the
making
of
new
ones
opened
fire
with
a
light
gun
of
the
type
this
was
our
first
experience
of
the
weapon
and
the
first
experience
of
a
is
very
disturbing
the
long
shriek
of
the
ordinary
shell
encourages
the
usually
futile
hope
that
by
ducking
one
may
avoid
destruction
with
the
there
is
no
hope
for
there
is
no
warning
the
sound
and
the
shell
arrive
almost
simultaneously
harry
platoon
did
not
like
these
things
the
first
three
burst
near
but
short
of
the
trench
filling
the
air
with
fumes
the
fourth
hit
and
removed
most
of
the
parapet
of
one
bay
harry
hurrying
along
to
the
place
found
the
four
men
there
considerably
surprised
crouching
in
the
corners
and
gazing
stupidly
at
the
yawning
gap
it
was
undesirable
if
not
impossible
to
rebuild
the
parapet
during
daylight
so
he
moved
them
into
the
next
bay
he
then
went
along
the
trench
to
see
that
all
the
men
had
ceased
work
he
heard
two
more
shells
burst
behind
him
as
he
went
on
his
way
back
two
men
rushing
round
a
corner
two
men
with
white
faces
smeared
with
black
and
a
little
blood
almost
knocked
him
down
they
were
speechless
he
went
through
the
bay
which
had
been
blown
in
it
was
silent
empty
the
bay
beyond
was
silent
too
save
for
the
buzzing
of
a
thousand
flies
in
it
he
had
left
eight
men
six
of
them
were
lying
dead
two
had
marvellously
escaped
the
first
had
blown
away
the
parapet
the
second
following
immediately
after
had
passed
miraculously
through
the
hole
straight
into
the
trench
a
piece
of
astounding
bad
luck
or
good
gunnery
the
men
could
not
be
buried
till
dusk
and
we
left
them
there
two
hours
later
as
we
sat
under
a
waterproof
sheet
and
talked
quietly
of
this
thing
there
came
an
engineer
officer
wandering
along
the
trench
he
had
come
crouching
through
those
two
shattered
and
yawning
bays
he
was
hot
and
very
angry
the
hell
do
you
bury
those
turks
he
said
must
have
been
there
for
weeks
this
is
the
kind
of
charge
which
infuriates
the
soldier
at
any
time
and
we
did
not
like
the
added
suggestion
that
those
six
good
men
of
the
platoon
were
dead
turks
we
told
him
they
were
englishmen
dead
two
hours
my
god
man
he
said
black
we
led
him
back
incredulous
to
the
place
when
we
got
there
we
understood
whether
from
the
explosion
or
the
scorching
sun
in
that
airless
place
i
know
not
but
those
six
men
were
as
he
said
literally
black
black
and
reeking
and
hideous
and
the
flies
harry
and
i
crouched
at
the
end
of
that
bay
truly
unable
to
believe
our
eyes
i
hope
i
may
never
again
see
such
horror
as
was
in
harry
face
they
were
his
platoon
and
he
knew
them
as
an
officer
should
after
the
explosion
there
had
been
only
four
whom
he
could
definitely
identify
now
there
was
not
one
in
two
hours
i
do
not
wish
to
labour
this
or
any
similar
episode
i
have
seen
many
worse
things
every
soldier
has
in
a
man
history
they
are
important
only
in
their
effect
upon
him
and
the
effect
they
have
is
determined
by
many
things
by
his
experience
and
his
health
and
his
state
of
mind
but
if
you
are
to
understand
what
i
may
call
the
of
a
man
as
i
want
you
to
understand
harry
you
must
not
ignore
particular
incidents
for
in
this
respect
the
lives
of
soldiers
are
not
uniform
though
many
may
live
in
the
same
regiment
and
fight
in
the
same
battles
the
experiences
which
matter
come
to
them
diversely
to
some
crowded
and
overwhelming
to
some
by
kind
and
delicate
degrees
and
so
do
their
spirits
develop
these
two
incidents
following
so
closely
upon
each
other
had
a
most
unhappy
cumulative
effect
on
harry
his
night
scouting
in
spite
of
its
miserable
end
had
not
perceptibly
dimmed
his
romantic
outlook
it
had
been
an
adventure
and
from
a
military
point
of
view
a
successful
adventure
the
colonel
had
been
pleased
with
the
reconnaissance
as
such
but
the
sight
of
his
six
poor
men
lying
black
and
beastly
in
that
sunlit
hole
had
killed
the
of
war
for
him
henceforth
it
must
be
a
necessary
but
disgusting
business
to
be
endured
like
a
but
this
in
the
end
was
inevitable
with
all
soldiers
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
though
for
a
boy
of
harry
temperament
it
was
an
ill
chance
that
it
should
come
so
soon
what
was
more
serious
was
this
the
two
incidents
had
revived
in
a
most
malignant
form
his
old
distrust
of
his
own
competence
i
found
that
he
was
brooding
over
this
accusing
himself
quite
wrongly
i
think
of
being
responsible
for
the
death
of
seven
men
he
had
bungled
the
scouting
he
had
recklessly
attracted
attention
to
the
party
and
trower
not
he
had
paid
for
it
he
had
moved
four
men
into
a
bay
where
four
others
already
were
and
six
of
them
had
been
killed
i
tried
hard
to
persuade
him
not
quite
honestly
that
he
had
done
absolutely
the
right
thing
in
scouting
of
all
things
i
told
him
a
man
take
chances
and
the
matter
of
the
two
was
sheer
bad
luck
it
was
no
good
he
was
a
fool
a
failure
unconsciously
the
colonel
encouraged
this
attitude
for
thinking
that
harry
nerve
might
well
have
been
shaken
by
his
first
experience
he
would
not
let
him
go
out
on
patrol
again
on
our
next
in
the
line
i
think
he
was
quite
mistaken
in
this
view
for
the
boy
did
not
even
seem
to
realize
how
narrow
his
own
escapes
had
been
so
concerned
was
he
about
his
lost
men
nor
did
this
explanation
of
the
colonel
veto
even
occur
to
him
rather
it
confirmed
him
in
his
distrust
of
himself
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
colonel
too
must
look
upon
him
as
a
bungler
a
waster
of
lives
all
this
was
very
bad
and
i
was
much
afraid
of
what
the
reaction
might
be
but
there
was
one
bright
spot
so
far
he
only
distrusted
his
military
capacity
there
was
no
sign
of
his
distrusting
his
own
courage
i
prayed
that
that
might
not
follow
v
came
with
all
its
plagues
and
fevers
and
irritable
distresses
life
in
the
became
daily
more
intolerable
there
set
in
a
steady
wind
from
the
which
blew
all
day
down
the
flayed
of
the
peninsula
raising
great
columns
of
blinding
maddening
dust
it
was
a
hot
parching
wind
which
in
no
way
mitigated
the
scorch
of
the
sun
and
the
dust
it
brought
became
a
definite
enemy
to
human
peace
it
pervaded
everything
it
poured
into
every
hole
and
and
filtered
into
every
man
belongings
it
formed
a
gritty
sediment
in
water
and
tea
it
passed
into
a
man
with
every
morsel
of
food
he
ate
and
scraped
and
tore
at
his
inside
it
covered
his
pipe
so
that
he
could
not
even
smoke
with
pleasure
it
lay
in
a
thick
coating
on
his
face
so
that
he
looked
like
a
wan
ghost
paler
than
disease
had
made
him
it
made
the
cleaning
of
his
rifle
a
too
too
frequent
farce
it
worked
under
his
breeches
and
gathered
at
the
back
of
his
knees
chafing
and
torturing
him
and
if
he
lay
down
to
sleep
in
his
hole
it
swept
in
billows
over
his
face
or
men
passing
clumsily
above
kicked
great
showers
upon
him
sleep
was
not
possible
in
the
while
that
wind
blew
but
indeed
there
were
many
things
which
made
rest
in
the
impossible
few
more
terrible
plagues
can
have
afflicted
british
troops
than
the
flies
of
gallipoli
in
may
by
comparison
there
were
none
in
june
they
became
unbearable
in
july
they
were
literally
inconceivable
most
englishmen
have
lain
down
some
gentle
summer
day
to
doze
on
a
shaded
lawn
and
found
that
one
or
two
persistent
flies
have
destroyed
the
repose
of
the
afternoon
many
women
have
turned
sick
at
the
sight
of
a
blowfly
in
their
butcher
shop
let
them
imagine
a
sun
in
a
place
where
there
is
little
or
no
shade
where
sanitary
arrangements
are
less
than
primitive
where
in
spite
of
all
precautions
there
are
scraps
of
bacon
and
sugar
and
lying
everywhere
in
the
dust
and
every
man
has
his
little
daily
store
of
food
somewhere
near
him
where
there
are
dead
bodies
and
the
carcasses
of
mules
easily
accessible
to
the
least
venturesome
fly
let
them
read
for
fly
a
hundred
a
thousand
a
million
and
even
then
they
will
not
exaggerate
the
horror
of
that
plague
under
it
the
disadvantages
of
a
sensitive
nature
and
a
delicate
upbringing
were
easy
to
see
an
officer
lies
down
in
the
afternoon
to
sleep
in
his
hole
the
flies
cluster
on
his
face
patiently
at
first
he
brushes
them
away
with
a
mechanical
movement
of
his
hand
by
and
by
he
does
it
angrily
his
temper
is
going
he
covers
his
face
with
a
handkerchief
it
is
distressingly
hot
but
at
least
he
may
have
some
rest
the
flies
settle
on
his
hand
on
his
neck
on
the
bare
part
of
his
leg
even
there
the
feel
of
them
is
becoming
a
genuine
torment
they
creep
under
the
handkerchief
there
is
one
on
his
lip
another
buzzing
about
his
eye
madly
he
tears
off
the
handkerchief
and
lashes
out
waving
it
furiously
till
the
air
is
free
the
flies
gather
on
the
walls
of
the
on
the
waterproof
sheet
and
watch
they
are
waiting
motionless
till
he
lies
down
again
he
throws
his
coat
over
his
bare
knees
and
lies
back
the
torment
begins
again
it
is
unendurable
he
gets
up
cursing
and
goes
out
better
to
walk
in
the
hot
sun
or
sit
under
the
in
the
windy
dust
but
look
into
the
crowded
ditches
of
the
men
some
of
them
are
fighting
the
same
fight
hands
moving
and
faces
twitching
like
the
flesh
of
horses
automatically
but
most
of
them
lie
still
not
asleep
but
in
a
kind
of
dogged
artificial
insensibility
the
flies
crowd
on
their
faces
they
swarm
about
their
eyes
and
crawl
unmolested
about
their
open
mouths
it
is
a
horrible
sight
but
those
men
are
lucky
then
there
was
always
a
great
noise
in
the
camp
for
men
would
be
called
for
from
headquarters
at
the
end
of
it
or
orders
passed
down
and
so
great
was
the
wind
and
the
noise
of
the
french
guns
and
the
turkish
shells
that
these
messages
had
to
be
bawled
from
man
to
man
the
men
grew
lazy
from
sheer
weariness
of
these
messages
so
that
they
were
mutilated
as
they
came
and
had
to
be
repeated
and
there
was
this
babel
always
the
men
too
like
the
officers
became
irritable
with
each
other
and
wrangled
incessantly
over
little
things
only
the
officers
argued
quietly
and
bitterly
and
the
men
shouted
oaths
at
each
other
and
filthy
epithets
there
was
only
a
yard
between
the
holes
of
the
officers
and
the
holes
of
the
men
and
their
raucous
quarrelling
grated
on
nerves
already
sensitive
from
the
trials
of
the
day
and
the
officer
came
near
to
cursing
his
own
men
and
that
is
bad
so
there
was
no
rest
to
be
had
in
the
camp
during
the
day
and
at
night
we
marched
out
in
long
columns
to
dig
in
the
whispering
gullies
or
unload
ships
on
the
beach
there
were
many
of
these
parties
and
we
were
much
overworked
as
all
infantry
units
invariably
are
and
only
at
long
intervals
there
came
an
evening
when
a
man
might
lie
down
under
the
perfect
stars
and
sleep
all
night
undisturbed
then
indeed
he
had
rest
and
when
he
woke
to
a
sudden
burst
of
lay
quiet
in
his
hole
too
tired
and
dreamy
to
be
afraid
dust
and
flies
and
the
food
and
the
water
and
our
weakness
joined
forces
against
us
and
dysentery
raged
among
us
there
were
many
who
had
never
heard
of
the
disease
and
thought
vaguely
of
the
distemper
of
dogs
those
who
had
heard
of
it
thought
of
it
as
something
rather
romantically
eastern
like
the
tsetse
fly
and
the
first
cases
were
invested
with
a
certain
mysterious
distinction
especially
as
most
of
them
were
sent
away
but
it
became
universal
everybody
had
it
and
everybody
could
not
be
sent
away
one
man
in
a
thousand
went
through
that
time
untouched
one
in
ten
escaped
with
a
slight
attack
but
the
remainder
lived
permanently
or
intermittently
in
a
condition
which
in
any
normal
campaign
would
have
long
since
sent
them
on
stretchers
to
the
base
the
men
could
not
be
spared
they
stayed
and
endured
and
tottered
at
their
work
thus
there
was
every
circumstance
to
encourage
infection
and
little
to
resist
it
one
by
one
the
officers
of
d
company
were
stricken
the
first
stages
were
mildly
unpleasant
encouraging
that
comfortable
sense
of
martyrdom
which
belongs
to
a
recognized
but
endurable
complaint
as
it
grew
worse
men
became
querulous
but
were
still
interested
in
themselves
and
those
not
in
the
final
stages
discussed
their
symptoms
emulously
disgustingly
still
a
little
anxious
to
be
worse
than
their
fellows
in
the
worst
stage
there
was
no
emulation
only
a
dull
misery
of
recurrent
pain
and
lassitude
and
disgust
a
man
could
not
touch
the
coarse
food
which
was
all
we
had
or
if
from
sheer
emptiness
he
did
his
sufferings
were
immediately
magnified
yet
always
he
had
a
wild
craving
for
delicate
food
and
as
he
turned
from
the
sickening
bacon
in
the
gritty
lid
of
his
conjured
bright
visions
of
lovely
dainties
which
might
satisfy
his
longing
and
give
him
back
his
strength
so
men
prayed
for
parcels
but
when
they
came
or
when
some
wanderer
came
back
from
the
islands
with
a
basket
of
grecian
eggs
too
often
it
was
too
late
for
the
sickest
men
and
their
agonies
were
only
increased
scientific
dieting
was
impossible
they
could
only
struggle
on
for
ever
sick
yet
for
ever
on
duty
this
was
the
awful
thing
when
a
man
reached
this
stage
the
army
was
lucky
indeed
if
it
did
not
lose
him
he
was
lucky
himself
if
he
did
not
die
but
so
strong
is
the
human
spirit
and
so
patient
the
human
body
that
most
won
through
this
phase
to
a
spasmodic
existence
of
alternate
sickness
and
precarious
health
and
when
they
said
to
themselves
am
well
and
ate
heartily
and
said
to
their
companions
and
that
is
what
you
should
do
the
disease
gripped
them
again
each
time
more
violently
all
this
sapped
the
strength
of
a
man
and
finally
there
came
a
terrible
debility
a
kind
of
paralysing
lassitude
when
it
needed
a
genuine
flogging
of
the
will
for
him
to
lift
himself
and
walk
across
the
camp
and
his
knees
seemed
permanently
feeble
as
if
a
fever
had
just
left
him
yet
many
endured
this
condition
for
weeks
and
months
till
the
fever
definitely
took
them
some
became
so
weak
that
while
they
still
tottered
up
to
the
line
and
about
their
duties
they
could
not
gratuitously
drag
themselves
to
the
beach
to
bathe
then
indeed
were
they
far
gone
for
the
evening
swims
were
the
few
paradisial
moments
of
that
time
when
the
sun
had
but
an
hour
to
live
and
the
wind
and
the
dust
and
the
flies
were
already
dwindling
we
climbed
down
a
where
the
indians
kept
their
sacred
but
odorous
goats
there
was
a
fringe
of
rocks
under
the
cliffs
where
we
could
dive
there
we
undressed
hot
and
grimy
lousy
thirsty
and
tired
along
the
rocks
solitary
indians
were
kneeling
towards
mecca
some
of
the
old
battered
boats
of
the
first
landing
were
still
nosing
the
shore
and
at
a
safe
distance
was
a
dead
mule
the
troops
did
not
come
here
but
waded
noisily
in
the
shallow
water
so
all
was
quiet
save
for
an
occasional
lazy
shell
from
asia
and
the
of
a
the
sea
at
this
hour
put
on
its
most
perfect
blue
and
the
across
the
straits
were
all
warm
and
twinkling
in
the
late
sun
so
we
sat
and
drank
in
the
strengthening
breeze
and
felt
the
clean
air
on
our
contaminated
flesh
and
plunging
luxuriously
into
the
lovely
water
forgot
for
a
magical
moment
all
our
weariness
and
disgust
when
a
man
could
not
do
this
he
was
ill
indeed
ii
and
by
this
time
we
had
found
each
other
out
we
had
discovered
a
true
standard
of
right
and
wrong
we
knew
quite
clearly
now
some
of
us
for
the
first
time
what
sort
of
action
was
and
we
were
fairly
clear
how
likely
each
of
us
was
to
do
such
an
action
we
knew
all
our
little
weaknesses
and
most
of
our
serious
flaws
under
that
they
could
not
long
be
hid
in
the
pleasant
life
of
london
or
oxford
we
had
had
no
occasion
to
do
anything
dishonourable
or
underhand
in
our
relations
with
other
men
we
had
not
even
wished
to
be
guilty
of
anything
worse
than
mild
unkindnesses
or
consistent
unpunctuality
but
behind
the
footlights
of
gallipoli
we
had
found
real
burning
temptations
and
we
had
found
our
characters
d
company
on
the
whole
was
lucky
and
had
stood
the
test
well
we
knew
that
burnett
was
but
we
knew
that
williams
of
a
company
was
incalculably
more
we
had
stood
in
the
dark
sap
at
night
and
reluctantly
overheard
the
men
of
his
company
speak
of
him
and
his
officers
but
little
weaknesses
beget
great
irritations
in
that
life
and
the
intimate
problems
of
communal
feeding
were
enough
to
search
out
all
our
weaknesses
we
knew
that
some
of
us
though
courageous
were
greedy
that
others
though
not
greedy
were
querulous
about
their
food
and
had
a
nasty
habit
of
out
for
their
rights
indeed
i
think
i
developed
this
habit
myself
we
had
had
trouble
about
parcels
parcels
in
theory
were
thrown
into
the
common
stock
of
the
mess
but
egerton
and
burnett
never
had
parcels
and
were
by
no
means
the
most
delicate
eaters
of
other
people
dainties
harry
and
hewett
reserved
some
portion
of
each
parcel
a
cake
or
a
slab
of
chocolate
which
they
ate
furtively
in
their
or
shared
with
each
other
in
the
dusk
burnett
ostentatiously
endowed
the
mess
with
his
entire
stock
but
afterwards
at
every
meal
hinted
sombrely
at
the
rapacity
of
those
who
had
devoured
it
harry
and
hewett
each
made
contributions
to
the
mess
but
harry
objected
to
the
excessive
consumption
of
this
food
by
burnett
and
hewett
who
gave
ungrudgingly
to
the
rest
of
us
had
a
similar
reservation
never
expressed
as
against
egerton
so
all
this
matter
of
food
set
in
motion
a
number
of
antagonisms
seldom
or
never
articulate
but
painfully
perceptible
at
every
meal
the
parcel
question
i
think
was
one
of
the
things
which
embittered
the
quarrel
between
harry
and
burnett
a
parcel
from
home
to
schoolboys
and
soldiers
and
prisoners
and
sailors
and
all
homesick
exiles
is
the
most
powerful
emblem
of
sentiment
and
affection
a
man
would
willingly
preserve
its
treasures
for
himself
to
gloat
over
alone
in
no
mere
fleshly
indulgence
but
as
a
concrete
expression
of
affection
from
the
home
for
which
he
longs
this
is
not
nonsense
he
likes
to
undo
the
strings
in
the
grubby
hole
which
is
his
present
home
and
secretly
become
sentimental
over
the
little
fond
packages
and
queer
loving
thoughts
which
have
composed
it
and
though
in
a
generous
impulse
he
may
say
to
his
companions
and
eat
this
cake
and
see
it
in
a
moment
disappear
it
is
hard
for
him
not
to
think
sister
or
wife
or
mother
made
this
they
thought
it
would
give
pleasure
for
many
days
already
it
is
gone
would
they
not
be
hurt
if
they
knew
he
feels
that
he
has
betrayed
the
tenderness
of
his
home
and
though
the
giving
of
pleasure
to
companions
he
likes
may
overcome
this
feeling
the
compulsory
squandering
of
such
precious
pleasure
on
a
man
he
despises
calls
up
the
worst
bitterness
of
his
heart
so
was
it
between
harry
and
burnett
if
by
the
way
it
be
suggested
that
burnett
was
entitled
to
feel
the
same
sentimental
jealousy
about
parcels
i
answer
that
parcels
came
on
his
own
order
from
the
soulless
hand
of
fortnum
and
mason
all
of
us
were
very
touchy
very
raw
and
irritable
in
that
fevered
atmosphere
men
who
were
always
late
in
relieving
another
on
watch
or
unreasonably
resented
a
minute
postponement
of
their
relief
or
never
had
any
article
of
their
own
but
for
ever
borrowed
and
electric
torches
and
from
more
methodical
people
or
were
overbearing
to
batmen
or
shifted
jobs
on
to
other
officers
or
slunk
off
to
bathe
alone
when
they
should
have
taken
their
sultry
platoon
such
men
made
enemies
quickly
between
eustace
and
hewett
who
had
been
good
friends
before
and
were
to
be
good
friends
again
there
grew
up
a
slow
animosity
hewett
was
one
of
the
methodical
class
of
officer
eustace
was
one
of
the
persistent
borrowers
moreover
as
i
have
said
he
was
a
cynic
and
he
argue
he
had
a
contentious
remark
for
every
moment
of
the
day
and
though
this
tormented
us
all
beyond
bearing
hewett
was
the
only
one
with
both
the
energy
and
the
intellectual
equipment
to
accept
his
challenges
so
these
two
argued
quietly
and
fiercely
in
the
hot
noon
or
the
blue
dusk
till
the
rest
of
us
were
weary
of
them
both
and
the
sound
of
eustace
harsh
tones
was
an
agony
to
the
nerves
they
were
both
too
consciously
refined
to
lose
their
tempers
healthily
and
when
they
reached
hewett
would
slink
away
like
an
injured
animal
to
his
burrow
in
this
conflict
harry
took
no
speaking
part
for
while
in
spirit
and
affection
he
was
on
hewett
side
he
paid
intellectual
tribute
to
eustace
conduct
of
the
argument
and
listened
as
a
rule
in
puzzled
silence
eustace
again
was
his
cordial
ally
against
burnett
while
hewett
had
merely
the
indifference
of
contempt
for
that
officer
so
it
was
all
a
strange
tangle
of
friendship
and
animosity
and
and
bitterness
yet
on
the
surface
you
understand
we
lived
on
terms
of
toleration
and
vague
geniality
except
for
the
disputations
of
hewett
and
eustace
there
was
little
open
disagreement
in
the
confined
space
of
a
company
mess
permanent
hostilities
would
make
life
impossible
it
is
only
generals
who
are
allowed
to
find
that
they
can
no
longer
with
each
other
and
resign
platoon
commanders
may
come
to
the
same
conclusion
but
they
have
to
go
on
acting
and
so
openly
we
laughed
and
endured
and
bore
with
each
other
only
there
was
always
this
undertone
of
irritations
and
animosities
which
in
the
maddening
conditions
of
our
life
could
never
be
altogether
silenced
and
might
at
any
moment
rise
to
a
strangled
scream
harry
appointment
as
scout
officer
was
the
first
thing
to
set
burnett
against
harry
though
already
many
things
had
set
harry
against
burnett
it
had
been
commonly
assumed
in
view
of
burnett
reputation
that
he
would
succeed
martin
as
scout
officer
the
selection
of
harry
took
us
a
little
by
surprise
though
it
only
showed
that
the
colonel
was
a
keener
judge
of
character
and
ability
than
the
rest
of
us
no
one
i
think
was
more
genuinely
pleased
that
burnett
was
not
to
be
scout
officer
than
burnett
himself
but
in
the
interests
of
his
pretensions
he
had
to
affect
an
air
of
disappointment
and
let
it
be
known
by
grunts
and
shrugs
and
sour
looks
that
he
considered
the
choice
of
harry
to
be
an
injury
to
himself
and
the
regiment
as
far
as
harry
was
concerned
this
resentment
of
burnett
was
more
or
less
genuine
for
his
reluctance
to
take
on
the
job
did
not
prevent
him
being
jealous
of
the
man
who
did
then
burnett
was
one
of
the
people
who
had
nothing
of
his
own
and
seemed
to
regard
harry
as
the
youngest
of
us
all
as
the
proper
person
to
provide
him
with
all
the
necessaries
of
life
in
those
days
we
had
no
plates
or
crockery
but
ate
and
drank
out
of
our
scratched
and
greasy
harry
disappeared
and
for
three
days
he
was
compelled
to
borrow
from
hewett
or
myself
a
tedious
and
to
him
hateful
business
one
day
burnett
had
finished
his
meal
a
long
way
ahead
of
any
of
us
and
harry
in
the
desperation
of
hungry
waiting
asked
him
for
the
loan
of
his
automatically
he
looked
at
the
bottom
of
the
tin
and
there
found
his
initials
inscribed
it
was
his
own
tin
further
some
one
had
tried
to
scratch
the
initials
out
harry
kept
his
temper
with
obvious
difficulty
burnett
knew
well
that
he
had
lost
his
we
were
all
sick
of
hearing
it
but
he
said
he
was
quite
ignorant
of
having
it
in
his
possession
when
harry
argued
with
him
burnett
sent
for
his
batman
and
cursed
him
for
taking
another
property
the
wretched
man
mumbled
that
he
had
it
and
withdrew
and
we
all
sat
in
silence
teeming
with
distrustful
thoughts
we
were
sorry
for
the
batman
we
were
sorry
for
harry
burnett
may
not
have
taken
the
with
his
own
hands
but
morally
he
stood
convicted
of
an
action
which
was
then
burnett
and
harry
took
a
together
to
dig
in
the
gully
burnett
was
the
senior
officer
but
left
harry
to
work
all
night
in
the
whispering
rain
of
stray
bullets
while
he
sat
in
an
and
drank
whisky
harry
did
not
object
to
this
the
absence
of
burnett
being
always
congenial
to
him
but
next
day
there
came
a
complimentary
message
from
the
brigadier
about
the
work
of
that
burnett
was
sent
for
and
warmly
praised
by
the
colonel
burnett
stood
smugly
and
said
nothing
harry
when
he
heard
of
it
was
furious
and
wanted
he
said
to
a
row
with
him
what
he
expected
burnett
to
say
i
do
know
the
man
could
hardly
stand
before
his
colonel
and
say
penrose
did
all
the
work
i
was
in
the
nearly
all
the
time
with
my
friends
and
had
several
drinks
a
row
in
any
case
would
be
intolerable
in
that
cramped
intimate
existence
and
i
dissuaded
harry
though
i
made
egerton
have
a
few
words
with
burnett
on
the
subject
harry
contented
himself
with
ironic
comments
on
burnett
and
asking
him
blandly
at
meals
if
he
expected
to
get
his
promotion
over
that
and
suggesting
to
egerton
that
burnett
should
take
harry
next
turn
of
duty
he
is
so
good
at
it
this
made
burnett
beautifully
angry
but
it
was
bitter
badinage
and
did
not
improve
the
social
atmosphere
there
were
a
number
of
such
incidents
between
the
two
they
were
very
petty
in
themselves
some
of
them
like
a
fly
but
in
their
cumulative
effect
very
large
and
distressing
in
many
cases
there
was
no
verbal
engagement
or
only
an
angry
inarticulate
mutter
public
unfettered
angers
were
necessarily
avoided
but
this
suppressed
condition
of
the
quarrel
made
it
more
malignant
like
a
disease
and
it
got
on
harry
nerves
indeed
it
got
on
mine
it
became
an
active
element
in
that
vast
complex
of
irritation
and
decay
which
was
eating
into
his
young
system
it
was
leagued
with
the
flies
and
the
dust
and
the
smells
and
the
bad
food
and
the
wind
and
the
harassing
shells
of
the
turks
and
the
disgustful
torment
of
disease
iii
for
harry
was
a
very
sick
man
he
had
endured
through
all
the
stages
of
dysentery
and
now
lived
with
that
awful
legacy
of
weakness
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
the
disease
had
not
wholly
left
him
but
some
days
he
lay
faint
with
excruciating
spasms
of
pain
slightly
built
and
constitutionally
fragile
at
the
beginning
he
was
now
a
mere
wasted
wisp
of
a
man
the
flesh
seemed
to
have
melted
from
his
face
and
when
he
stood
naked
on
the
beach
it
seemed
that
the
moving
of
his
bones
must
soon
tear
holes
in
the
unsubstantial
skin
standing
in
the
trench
with
the
two
points
of
his
jutting
out
like
promontories
above
his
shirt
and
a
pale
film
of
dust
over
his
face
he
looked
like
the
wan
ghost
of
some
forgotten
soldier
on
the
western
front
where
one
case
of
dysentery
created
a
panic
among
the
authorities
and
in
the
most
urgent
days
they
have
never
had
to
rely
on
skeletons
to
fight
he
would
long
since
have
been
bundled
off
but
in
this
orgy
of
disease
no
officer
could
be
sent
away
who
was
willing
to
stay
and
could
still
totter
up
the
gully
and
harry
would
not
go
when
he
went
to
the
battalion
doctor
it
was
with
an
airy
request
for
the
impotent
palliatives
then
provided
for
early
dysentery
and
with
no
suggestion
of
the
sickness
that
was
upon
him
one
day
he
would
not
come
down
to
the
rocks
and
bathe
so
feeble
he
was
know
now
he
said
meaning
of
that
bit
in
the
psalms
my
knees
are
like
water
and
all
my
bones
are
out
of
joint
i
said
not
fit
to
stay
here
why
not
go
sick
at
which
he
smiled
weakly
and
said
that
he
might
be
better
in
a
day
or
two
pathetic
hope
all
men
had
it
and
so
hewett
and
i
walked
down
a
little
sadly
alone
marvelling
at
the
boy
courage
for
it
seemed
to
us
that
he
wanted
to
stay
and
see
it
through
and
if
indeed
he
might
recover
we
could
not
afford
to
lose
him
so
we
said
no
more
but
by
degrees
i
gained
a
different
impression
harry
still
opened
his
mind
to
hewett
and
myself
more
than
to
any
one
else
but
it
was
by
no
direct
speech
rather
by
the
things
he
did
not
say
the
sentences
half
finished
the
look
in
his
eyes
that
the
knowledge
came
that
harry
did
want
to
go
away
the
romantic
impulse
had
perished
long
since
in
that
ruined
trench
but
now
even
the
more
mundane
zest
of
doing
his
duty
had
lost
its
savour
in
the
long
ordeal
of
sickness
and
physical
distress
he
did
want
to
go
sick
he
had
only
to
speak
a
word
and
still
he
would
not
go
when
i
knew
this
i
marvelled
at
his
courage
yet
more
for
many
days
i
watched
him
fighting
this
lonely
conflict
with
himself
a
conflict
more
terrible
and
exacting
than
any
battle
sometimes
the
doctor
came
and
sat
under
our
and
some
of
us
spoke
jestingly
of
the
universal
sickness
and
asked
him
how
ill
we
must
be
before
he
would
send
us
home
harry
alone
sat
silent
it
was
no
joke
to
him
how
do
feel
now
penrose
said
the
doctor
you
getting
your
all
right
harry
opened
his
mouth
but
for
a
moment
said
nothing
i
think
it
had
been
in
his
mind
to
say
what
he
did
feel
but
he
only
murmured
right
thank
you
doctor
the
doctor
looked
at
him
queerly
he
knew
well
enough
but
it
was
his
task
to
keep
men
on
the
peninsula
not
to
send
them
away
once
i
spent
an
afternoon
in
one
of
the
hospital
ships
in
the
bay
when
i
came
back
and
told
them
of
the
cool
wards
and
pleasant
nurses
and
all
the
peace
and
cleanliness
and
comfort
that
was
there
i
caught
wistful
gaze
upon
me
and
i
stopped
it
was
well
enough
for
the
rest
of
us
in
comparative
health
to
imagine
luxuriously
those
unattainable
amenities
none
of
us
were
ill
enough
then
to
go
sick
if
we
wished
it
harry
was
and
i
knew
that
such
talk
must
be
an
intolerable
temptation
then
one
day
on
his
way
up
to
the
line
with
a
he
nearly
fainted
felt
it
coming
on
he
told
me
a
block
i
thought
to
myself
this
is
the
end
of
it
all
for
me
anyhow
i
actually
did
go
off
for
a
moment
i
think
and
then
some
one
pushed
me
from
behind
and
as
we
moved
on
it
wore
off
again
i
did
swear
harry
stopped
realizing
the
confession
he
had
made
i
tried
to
feel
for
myself
the
awful
bitterness
of
that
awakening
in
the
stifling
trench
shuffling
uphill
with
the
flies
but
he
had
told
me
now
everything
i
had
only
guessed
before
and
once
more
i
urged
him
to
go
sick
and
have
done
with
it
would
he
said
i
not
sure
i
know
i
jolly
ill
and
not
fit
for
a
thing
but
i
not
sure
if
it
only
that
i
was
pretty
brave
when
i
got
here
i
think
i
nodded
i
think
i
am
still
but
last
time
we
were
in
the
line
i
found
i
did
like
looking
over
the
top
nearly
so
much
so
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
quite
all
right
in
that
way
before
i
go
sick
besides
you
know
what
everybody
says
could
say
anything
about
you
i
told
him
only
got
to
look
at
you
to
see
that
you
got
one
foot
in
the
grave
we
go
up
again
he
said
if
i
not
better
after
that
think
about
it
again
i
had
to
be
content
with
that
though
i
was
not
content
for
my
fears
were
fulfilled
since
in
the
grip
of
this
sickness
he
had
begun
at
last
to
be
doubtful
of
his
own
courage
but
that
night
burnett
went
to
the
doctor
and
said
that
he
was
too
ill
to
go
on
so
far
as
the
rest
of
us
knew
he
had
never
had
anything
but
the
inevitable
preliminary
attack
of
dysentery
though
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
most
of
us
were
so
wrapped
up
in
the
exquisite
contemplation
of
our
own
sufferings
that
we
had
little
time
to
study
the
condition
of
others
the
doctor
however
had
no
doubts
about
burnett
he
sent
him
back
to
us
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
and
a
dose
of
chlorodyne
the
story
leaked
out
quickly
and
there
was
much
comment
adverse
to
burnett
when
harry
heard
it
he
led
me
away
to
his
it
was
an
evening
of
heavy
calm
like
the
inside
of
a
cathedral
only
a
few
mules
circling
dustily
at
exercise
in
the
velvet
gloom
and
the
distant
glimmer
of
the
scotsmen
fires
made
any
stir
of
movement
the
men
had
gone
early
to
their
blankets
and
now
sang
softly
their
most
sentimental
songs
reserved
always
for
the
night
before
another
journey
to
the
line
they
sang
them
in
a
low
croon
of
ecstatic
melancholy
marvellously
in
tune
with
the
purple
hush
of
the
evening
for
all
its
aching
regret
it
was
a
sound
full
of
hope
and
gentle
resolution
harry
whispered
to
me
heard
about
burnett
thank
god
nobody
can
say
those
things
about
me
i
not
going
off
this
peninsula
till
i
pushed
off
i
said
nothing
it
was
a
heroic
sentiment
and
this
was
the
heroic
hour
it
is
what
men
say
in
the
morning
that
matters
in
the
morning
we
moved
off
as
the
sun
came
up
there
had
been
heavy
firing
nearly
all
night
and
over
achi
baba
in
the
cloudless
sky
there
hung
a
portent
it
was
as
though
some
giant
had
been
blowing
and
with
inhuman
dexterity
had
twined
and
laced
these
rings
together
without
any
of
them
losing
their
perfection
of
form
as
the
sun
came
up
these
stood
out
a
rosy
pink
against
the
blue
distance
and
while
we
marched
through
the
sleeping
camps
turned
gently
through
dull
gold
to
pale
pearl
i
have
never
known
what
made
this
marvel
a
few
clouds
forgotten
by
the
wind
or
the
smoke
of
the
battle
but
i
marched
with
my
eyes
upon
it
all
the
stumbling
way
to
achi
baba
and
when
i
found
harry
at
a
halt
he
too
was
gazing
at
the
wonder
with
all
his
men
an
omen
he
said
or
bad
he
said
i
have
never
understood
omens
i
suppose
they
are
good
or
bad
according
to
the
mind
of
the
man
who
sees
them
and
i
was
glad
that
harry
thought
it
was
good
vi
it
was
one
of
the
great
dates
one
of
those
red
dates
which
build
up
the
calendar
of
a
soldier
past
and
dwell
in
his
memory
when
the
date
of
his
own
birth
is
almost
forgotten
it
is
strange
what
definite
these
dates
of
a
man
battle
days
become
in
his
calculation
of
time
like
the
foundation
of
rome
an
old
soldier
will
sigh
and
say
i
know
that
was
when
jim
died
it
was
ten
days
after
the
fourth
of
june
or
was
promoted
the
day
before
the
twelfth
of
july
the
years
pile
up
and
zero
after
zero
day
is
added
for
ever
to
his
primitive
calendar
and
not
one
of
them
is
thrust
from
his
reverent
memory
but
at
each
anniversary
he
wakes
and
says
is
the
of
february
or
the
of
july
and
thinks
of
old
companions
who
went
down
on
that
day
and
though
he
has
seen
glorious
successes
since
he
will
ever
think
with
a
special
tenderness
of
the
black
early
failures
when
he
first
saw
battle
and
his
friends
going
under
and
if
in
any
place
where
soldiers
gather
and
tell
old
tales
there
are
two
men
who
can
say
to
each
other
too
was
at
helles
on
such
a
date
there
is
a
great
bond
between
them
on
one
of
these
days
we
sat
under
the
and
waited
up
the
hill
one
of
that
long
series
of
heroic
costly
was
going
through
we
were
in
reserve
we
had
done
six
turns
in
the
trenches
without
doing
an
attack
when
we
came
out
we
were
very
ready
to
attack
very
sure
of
ourselves
now
we
were
not
so
sure
of
ourselves
we
were
waiting
and
there
was
a
terrible
noise
very
early
the
guns
had
begun
and
everywhere
from
the
straits
to
the
sea
were
the
loud
barkings
of
the
french
thinly
assisted
by
the
british
artillery
which
was
scanty
and
had
almost
no
ammunition
but
the
big
ships
came
out
from
imbros
and
stood
off
and
swelled
the
chorus
dropping
their
huge
shells
on
the
very
peak
of
the
little
that
tops
achi
baba
and
covering
his
western
slopes
with
monstrous
eruptions
of
black
and
yellow
down
in
the
thirsty
wilderness
of
the
the
few
troops
in
reserve
lay
restless
under
occasional
or
huddled
under
the
exiguous
shelter
of
stretched
over
their
scratchings
in
the
earth
they
looked
up
and
saw
the
whole
of
the
great
hill
swathed
in
smoke
and
dust
and
filthy
fumes
and
heard
the
ruthless
crackle
of
the
turks
rifles
incredibly
rapid
and
sustained
and
they
thought
of
their
friends
scrambling
over
in
the
bright
sun
trying
to
get
to
those
rifles
they
themselves
were
thin
and
wasted
with
disease
and
this
uncertainty
of
waiting
in
readiness
for
they
knew
not
what
plucked
at
their
nerves
they
could
not
rest
or
sleep
for
the
flies
crawled
over
their
mouths
and
eyes
and
tormented
them
ceaselessly
and
great
storms
of
dust
swept
upon
them
as
they
lay
they
were
parched
with
thirst
but
they
must
not
drink
for
their
were
filled
with
the
allowance
and
none
knew
when
they
would
be
filled
again
if
a
man
took
out
of
his
haversack
a
chunk
of
bread
it
was
immediately
black
with
flies
and
he
could
not
eat
sometimes
a
shell
came
over
the
straits
from
asia
with
a
quick
shrill
shriek
and
burst
at
the
top
of
the
cliffs
near
the
staff
officers
who
stood
there
and
gazed
up
the
hill
with
glasses
all
morning
the
noise
increased
and
the
shells
streamed
up
the
hill
with
a
sound
like
a
hundred
expresses
vanishing
into
a
hundred
tunnels
and
there
was
no
news
but
soon
the
wounded
began
to
trickle
down
and
there
were
rumours
of
a
great
success
with
terrible
losses
in
the
afternoon
the
news
became
uncertain
and
disturbing
most
of
the
morning
fruits
had
been
lost
and
by
evening
they
knew
that
indeed
it
had
been
a
terrible
day
under
our
we
were
very
fidgety
there
had
been
no
mail
for
many
days
and
we
had
only
copies
of
the
and
the
which
we
pretended
listlessly
to
read
eustace
had
an
ancient
and
hewett
a
shilling
edition
of
harry
in
the
morning
kept
climbing
excitedly
up
the
trees
to
gaze
at
the
obscure
haze
of
smoke
on
the
hill
and
trying
vainly
to
divine
what
was
going
on
but
after
a
little
he
too
sat
silent
and
brooding
we
were
no
longer
irritable
with
each
other
but
studiously
considerate
as
if
each
felt
that
he
might
want
to
take
back
a
spiteful
word
and
the
other
be
dead
all
our
valises
and
our
sparse
had
long
been
packed
away
for
we
had
now
been
standing
by
for
hours
and
we
lay
uneasily
on
the
hard
ground
shifting
continually
from
posture
to
posture
to
escape
the
unfriendly
protuberances
of
the
soil
in
the
tree
the
crickets
chirped
on
always
in
strange
indifference
to
the
storm
of
noise
about
them
they
were
hateful
those
crickets
now
and
then
egerton
was
summoned
to
headquarters
and
when
he
came
back
each
man
said
to
himself
has
got
our
orders
and
some
would
not
look
at
him
but
talked
suddenly
of
something
else
and
some
said
to
him
with
a
painful
cheeriness
orders
and
when
he
shook
his
head
cursed
a
little
but
in
their
hearts
wondered
if
they
were
glad
for
the
waiting
was
bad
indeed
but
who
knew
what
tasks
they
would
have
when
the
orders
came
often
the
reserves
had
the
worst
of
it
in
these
affairs
a
forlorn
hope
of
an
attack
without
artillery
digging
a
new
line
under
fire
beating
off
the
counterattack
but
the
waiting
became
intolerable
and
all
were
glad
an
hour
before
sunset
when
we
filed
off
slowly
by
every
gun
was
busy
again
and
all
along
the
path
to
the
hill
batteries
of
barked
suddenly
from
unsuspected
holes
so
close
that
a
man
heart
seemed
to
halt
at
the
shock
the
gully
was
full
of
confusion
and
wounded
and
tired
officers
and
odd
groups
of
men
bandying
rumours
and
arguing
in
the
sun
up
the
tale
came
mysteriously
down
the
line
that
we
were
to
attack
a
trench
by
ourselves
a
whole
brigade
had
tried
and
failed
there
was
a
redoubt
there
were
endless
some
laughed
rumour
but
most
men
felt
in
their
heart
that
there
was
something
in
it
and
inwardly
themselves
together
at
last
they
were
to
be
in
a
real
battle
and
walk
naked
in
the
open
through
the
rapid
fire
and
as
they
moved
on
there
came
over
them
an
overpowering
sense
of
the
irrevocable
they
thought
of
that
summer
day
in
when
they
walked
into
the
recruiting
office
it
had
seemed
a
small
thing
then
but
that
was
what
had
done
it
had
brought
them
into
this
blazing
gully
with
the
frogs
croaking
and
the
men
moaning
in
corners
with
their
legs
messed
up
if
they
had
known
about
this
gully
then
and
these
flies
and
this
battle
they
were
going
to
then
perhaps
they
would
have
done
something
else
in
that
august
gone
into
a
dockyard
joined
the
like
jim
roberts
well
they
had
and
they
were
not
really
sorry
only
let
there
be
no
more
waiting
and
let
it
be
quick
and
merciful
no
stomach
wounds
and
nastiness
no
lying
out
in
the
scrub
for
a
day
with
the
sun
and
the
flies
and
no
water
look
at
that
officer
on
the
stretcher
wo
last
long
remember
his
face
his
platoon
relieved
us
somewhere
where
was
it
hope
i
do
get
one
like
him
nasty
mess
would
like
one
in
the
shoulder
if
it
got
to
be
hospital
ship
get
home
perhaps
no
they
send
you
to
egypt
officer
said
so
hallo
halting
here
merton
trench
old
reserve
line
getting
dark
not
wait
till
dawn
i
hope
ca
stand
much
more
waiting
pass
the
word
company
commanders
to
see
the
colonel
that
done
it
there
goes
egerton
good
man
thinks
a
lot
of
me
try
not
to
let
him
down
but
what
egerton
and
the
others
heard
from
the
colonel
made
a
vain
thing
of
all
this
bracing
of
men
spirits
there
was
a
muddle
the
attack
was
cancelled
no
one
knew
where
the
turks
were
where
anybody
was
we
were
to
stay
the
night
in
this
old
reserve
trench
and
relieve
the
front
line
in
the
morning
when
egerton
told
his
officers
only
burnett
spoke
he
said
usual
i
wanted
a
go
at
the
old
turks
and
we
knew
that
it
was
not
true
the
rest
of
us
said
nothing
for
we
were
wondering
if
it
were
true
of
ourselves
i
went
with
harry
to
his
platoon
they
too
said
nothing
and
their
faces
were
expressionless
but
they
were
cold
now
and
hungry
and
suddenly
very
tired
and
they
had
no
real
fire
of
battle
in
them
they
had
waited
too
long
for
this
crowning
experience
of
an
attack
braced
themselves
for
it
too
often
to
be
disappointed
and
i
knew
that
they
were
glad
but
they
did
not
mind
being
glad
they
pondered
no
doubts
about
themselves
only
curled
up
like
animals
in
corners
to
sleep
harry
too
no
doubt
had
braced
himself
like
the
rest
of
us
and
he
too
must
have
been
glad
glad
to
lie
down
and
look
forward
after
all
to
seeing
another
sunrise
but
i
thought
of
his
doubts
about
himself
and
i
felt
that
this
business
was
far
from
easing
his
burden
for
me
and
for
the
men
it
was
a
simple
thing
the
postponement
of
a
battle
with
the
turks
for
harry
it
was
the
postponement
of
a
personal
test
the
battle
inside
him
still
went
on
only
it
went
on
more
bitterly
ii
there
was
a
great
muddle
in
front
troops
of
two
different
brigades
were
hopelessly
entangled
in
the
shallow
trenches
they
had
taken
from
the
turks
they
had
few
officers
left
and
their
staffs
had
the
most
imperfect
impressions
of
the
whereabouts
of
their
mangled
commands
so
the
sun
was
well
up
when
we
finally
took
over
the
line
this
was
in
defiance
of
all
tradition
but
the
turk
was
shaken
and
did
not
molest
us
the
men
who
passed
us
on
their
way
down
grimly
wished
us
joy
of
what
they
had
left
their
faces
were
pale
and
drawn
full
of
loathing
and
weariness
but
they
said
little
and
the
impression
grew
that
there
was
something
up
there
which
they
could
not
even
begin
to
describe
it
was
a
still
scorching
morning
and
as
we
moved
on
the
air
became
heavy
with
a
sickening
stench
the
most
awful
of
all
smells
that
man
can
be
called
to
endure
because
it
preyed
on
the
imagination
as
well
as
the
senses
for
we
knew
now
what
it
was
we
came
into
a
turkish
trench
broad
and
shallow
in
the
first
bay
lay
two
bodies
a
lowlander
and
a
turk
they
lay
where
they
had
killed
each
other
and
they
were
very
foul
and
loathsome
in
the
sun
a
man
looked
up
at
them
and
passed
on
thinking
i
have
got
to
stay
here
in
the
next
bay
there
were
three
dead
all
englishmen
and
in
the
next
there
were
more
and
he
thought
was
a
hot
fight
just
here
but
as
he
moved
on
and
in
each
succeeding
bay
beheld
the
same
corrupt
aftermath
of
yesterday
battle
the
suspicion
came
to
him
that
this
was
no
local
horror
over
the
whole
front
of
the
attack
along
two
lines
of
trenches
these
regiments
of
dead
were
everywhere
found
strung
in
unnatural
heaps
along
the
parapets
or
sprawling
horribly
half
into
the
trench
so
that
he
touched
them
as
he
passed
yet
still
he
could
not
believe
and
at
each
corner
thought
there
will
be
none
in
this
bay
but
always
there
were
more
until
if
he
were
not
careful
or
very
callous
it
began
to
get
on
his
nerves
so
that
at
the
traverses
he
almost
prayed
that
there
might
be
no
more
beyond
yet
many
did
not
realize
what
was
before
them
till
they
were
finally
posted
in
the
bays
they
were
to
garrison
three
or
four
in
a
bay
then
they
looked
up
at
the
sprawling
horrors
on
the
parapet
and
behind
them
just
above
their
heads
and
knew
that
these
were
to
be
their
close
companions
all
that
sweltering
day
and
perhaps
beyond
the
regiment
we
had
relieved
had
been
too
exhausted
by
the
attack
or
too
to
bury
more
than
a
few
and
the
turkish
snipers
made
it
impossible
to
do
anything
during
the
day
and
so
we
sat
all
the
scorching
hours
of
the
sun
or
moved
listlessly
up
and
down
trying
not
to
look
upwards
but
there
was
a
hideous
fascination
about
the
things
so
that
after
a
few
hours
a
man
came
to
know
the
bodies
in
his
bay
with
a
sickening
intimacy
and
could
have
told
you
many
details
about
each
of
them
their
regiment
and
how
they
lay
and
how
they
had
died
and
little
things
about
their
uniforms
a
missing
button
or
some
papers
or
an
old
photograph
sticking
out
of
a
pocket
all
of
them
were
alive
with
flies
and
at
noon
when
we
took
out
our
bread
and
began
to
eat
the
flies
rose
in
a
great
black
swarm
and
fell
upon
the
food
in
our
hands
after
that
no
one
could
eat
all
day
men
were
being
sent
away
by
the
doctor
stricken
with
sheer
nausea
by
the
flies
and
the
stench
and
the
things
they
saw
and
went
retching
down
the
trench
to
keep
away
the
awful
reek
we
went
about
for
a
little
in
the
old
but
the
heat
and
burden
of
them
in
the
hot
airless
trench
was
intolerable
the
officers
had
no
but
sat
under
the
parapets
like
the
men
no
officer
went
sick
no
officer
could
be
spared
and
indeed
we
seemed
to
have
a
greater
power
of
resistance
to
this
ordeal
of
disgust
than
the
men
but
i
do
know
how
harry
survived
it
being
already
in
a
very
bad
way
physically
it
affected
him
more
than
the
rest
of
us
and
it
was
the
first
day
i
had
seen
his
cheerfulness
defeated
at
the
worst
he
had
always
been
ready
to
laugh
a
little
at
our
misfortunes
the
great
of
a
soldier
and
make
ironical
remarks
about
burnett
or
the
staff
this
day
he
had
no
laugh
left
in
him
and
i
thought
sadly
of
that
first
morning
when
he
jumped
over
the
parapet
to
look
at
a
dead
turk
he
had
seen
enough
now
in
the
evening
the
turk
was
still
a
little
chastened
and
all
night
we
laboured
at
the
burying
of
the
bodies
it
was
bad
work
but
so
strong
was
the
horror
upon
us
that
every
man
who
could
be
spared
took
his
part
careless
of
sleep
or
rest
so
long
as
he
should
not
sit
for
another
day
with
those
things
but
we
could
only
bury
half
of
them
that
night
and
all
the
next
day
we
went
again
through
that
lingering
torment
and
in
the
afternoon
when
we
had
orders
to
go
up
to
the
front
line
after
dusk
for
an
attack
we
were
glad
it
was
one
of
the
very
few
moments
in
my
experience
when
the
legend
of
a
regiment
pleasure
at
the
prospect
of
battle
came
true
for
anything
was
welcome
if
only
we
could
get
out
of
that
trench
away
from
the
smell
and
the
flies
away
from
those
bodies
iii
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
all
about
that
attack
only
so
much
of
it
as
affects
this
history
which
is
the
history
of
a
man
and
not
of
the
war
it
was
a
affair
and
eventually
a
failure
d
company
was
in
reserve
and
our
only
immediate
task
was
to
provide
a
small
forty
men
under
an
officer
to
dig
some
sort
of
communication
ditch
to
the
new
line
when
taken
burnett
was
told
off
for
this
job
we
took
these
things
more
or
less
in
turn
and
it
was
his
turn
and
burnett
did
not
like
it
we
sat
round
a
single
candle
under
a
waterproof
sheet
in
a
sort
of
open
recess
at
the
back
of
the
front
line
while
egerton
gave
him
his
orders
and
there
ran
in
my
head
the
old
bit
about
all
began
with
one
accord
to
make
excuse
burnett
made
no
actual
excuse
he
could
not
but
he
asked
aggressive
questions
about
the
arrangements
which
plainly
said
that
he
considered
this
task
too
dangerous
and
too
difficult
for
burnett
he
wanted
more
men
he
wanted
another
officer
but
no
more
could
be
spared
from
an
already
small
reserve
he
was
full
of
high
ground
on
the
right
from
which
his
party
would
be
enfiladed
and
shot
down
to
a
man
however
he
went
and
we
sat
listening
to
the
rapid
fire
or
the
dull
thud
of
bombs
until
in
front
a
strange
quiet
fell
but
to
right
and
left
were
the
sounds
of
many
as
usual
no
one
knew
what
had
happened
but
we
expected
a
summons
at
any
moment
we
were
all
restless
and
jumpy
particularly
harry
for
a
man
who
has
doubts
of
himself
or
too
much
imagination
to
be
in
reserve
is
the
worst
thing
possible
harry
was
talkative
again
and
held
forth
about
the
absurdity
of
the
whole
attack
as
to
which
he
was
perfectly
right
but
i
felt
that
all
the
time
he
was
thinking
i
do
the
right
thing
shall
i
do
the
right
thing
shall
i
make
a
mess
of
it
i
went
out
and
looked
over
the
parapet
but
could
make
nothing
out
then
i
saw
two
figures
loom
through
the
dark
and
scramble
into
the
trench
and
after
them
came
others
all
along
the
line
coming
in
anyhow
in
disorder
then
burnett
came
along
the
trench
and
crawled
in
under
the
waterproof
sheet
i
followed
no
good
he
was
saying
men
wo
stick
it
it
just
what
i
told
you
enfiladed
from
that
high
ground
over
there
two
many
casualties
have
you
had
said
egerton
killed
and
two
wounded
there
was
silence
but
it
was
charged
with
eloquent
thoughts
it
was
clear
what
had
happened
the
were
firing
blindly
from
the
right
probably
over
the
heads
of
the
party
the
small
casualties
showed
that
casualties
are
the
test
no
doubt
the
men
had
not
liked
the
stream
of
bullets
overhead
at
any
moment
the
gun
might
lower
but
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
digging
being
done
given
an
officer
who
would
assert
himself
and
keep
the
men
together
that
was
what
an
officer
was
for
and
burnett
had
failed
he
had
let
the
company
down
egerton
i
knew
was
considering
what
to
do
the
job
had
to
be
done
but
should
he
send
burnett
again
with
orders
not
to
return
until
he
had
finished
as
he
deserved
or
should
he
send
a
more
reliable
officer
and
make
sure
then
harry
burst
in
me
take
my
platoon
he
said
stick
it
all
right
and
his
tone
was
full
of
contempt
for
burnett
full
of
determination
no
doubts
about
him
now
well
we
sent
him
out
with
his
platoon
and
all
night
they
dug
and
sweated
in
the
dark
the
did
lower
at
times
and
there
were
many
casualties
but
harry
moved
up
and
down
in
the
open
cheerful
and
encouraging
getting
away
the
wounded
and
there
were
no
signs
of
the
men
not
sticking
it
i
went
out
and
stayed
with
him
for
an
hour
or
so
and
thought
him
wonderful
curious
from
what
strange
springs
inspiration
comes
for
harry
for
the
second
time
had
been
genuinely
inspired
by
the
evil
example
of
his
enemy
probably
in
the
first
place
he
had
welcomed
the
chance
of
doing
something
at
last
of
putting
his
doubts
to
the
test
but
i
am
sure
that
what
chiefly
carried
him
through
that
night
weak
and
exhausted
as
he
was
was
the
thought
let
them
down
burnett
let
them
down
i
not
going
to
let
them
down
anyhow
he
did
very
well
but
in
the
morning
he
was
carried
down
to
the
beach
in
a
high
fever
and
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
for
i
think
burnett
would
have
done
him
a
mischief
vii
so
harry
stayed
till
he
was
off
as
he
had
promised
and
i
was
glad
he
had
gone
like
that
i
had
long
wanted
him
to
leave
the
peninsula
somehow
for
i
felt
he
should
be
spared
for
greater
things
but
knowing
something
of
his
peculiar
temperament
i
did
not
want
his
career
there
to
end
on
a
note
of
simple
failure
a
dull
surrender
to
sickness
in
the
as
it
turned
out
the
accident
of
the
and
the
way
in
which
harry
had
seized
his
chance
sent
him
off
with
a
renewed
confidence
in
himself
and
with
regard
to
burnett
even
a
sense
of
triumph
so
i
was
not
surprised
when
his
letters
began
to
reveal
something
of
the
old
enthusiastic
harry
chafing
at
the
dreary
routine
of
the
depot
and
looking
for
adventure
again
but
i
am
anticipating
they
sent
him
home
of
course
it
was
no
good
keeping
any
one
in
his
condition
at
egypt
or
malta
for
the
prolonged
dysentery
had
produced
the
usual
complications
i
had
a
letter
from
malta
and
one
from
the
mediterranean
club
at
gibraltar
where
he
had
a
sultry
week
looking
over
the
bay
seeing
the
ships
steam
out
for
england
he
told
me
and
longing
to
be
in
one
for
it
took
many
months
to
wash
away
the
taste
of
the
peninsula
and
much
more
than
the
austere
comforts
of
the
hospital
at
gibraltar
even
the
hot
august
sun
in
the
alameda
was
hatefully
reminiscent
then
six
weeks
milk
diet
at
a
hospital
in
devonshire
convalescence
and
a
month
leave
then
harry
married
a
wife
i
did
not
know
the
lady
a
miss
thickness
and
she
does
not
come
into
the
story
very
much
though
she
probably
affected
it
a
good
deal
wives
usually
do
affect
a
story
though
they
are
one
of
the
many
things
which
by
the
absolute
official
standard
of
military
duty
are
necessarily
not
reckoned
with
at
all
not
being
the
president
of
a
i
did
reckon
with
it
and
when
i
had
read
harry
letter
about
his
wedding
i
said
see
again
for
in
those
early
years
it
was
generally
assumed
that
a
man
returned
from
service
at
the
front
need
not
go
out
again
unless
he
wished
for
a
period
almost
incalculably
remote
and
being
a
newly
married
man
myself
i
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
harry
would
want
to
rush
into
the
breach
just
yet
but
about
may
that
would
be
we
had
done
with
gallipoli
and
come
to
france
after
four
months
idling
in
the
aegean
islands
i
had
another
letter
much
delayed
from
which
i
will
give
you
an
extract
never
thought
i
should
want
to
go
out
again
you
remember
we
all
swore
we
never
should
but
i
do
i
fed
to
the
teeth
with
this
the
depot
in
dorsetshire
but
company
drill
and
lectures
on
march
discipline
and
all
the
old
stuff
we
still
attack
hill
twice
weekly
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
still
no
one
but
a
few
of
the
officers
knows
exactly
which
hill
it
is
since
we
always
stop
halfway
for
or
because
there
hopeless
confusion
there
nobody
amusing
here
williams
has
got
a
company
and
swanks
like
blazes
about
front
but
i
think
most
people
see
through
him
my
wife
got
rooms
in
a
cottage
near
here
but
they
wo
let
me
sleep
out
and
i
do
get
there
till
pretty
late
most
days
ca
you
get
the
colonel
to
apply
for
me
i
do
believe
it
allowed
but
he
sure
to
be
able
to
wangle
it
otherwise
i
shall
be
here
for
the
rest
of
the
war
because
the
more
you
been
out
the
less
likely
you
are
to
get
out
again
if
you
want
to
while
there
are
lots
who
do
want
to
go
and
would
be
any
earthly
good
and
stand
in
hourly
danger
of
being
sent
i
want
to
see
france
i
answered
on
a
single
sheet
very
well
but
what
about
does
she
concur
i
told
you
i
was
a
married
man
his
answer
was
equally
brief
does
know
but
she
would
well
it
was
my
business
so
we
it
i
was
adjutant
then
and
harry
came
out
to
france
but
i
was
sorry
for
penrose
ii
i
do
not
know
if
all
this
seems
tedious
and
unnecessary
i
hope
not
for
it
is
very
relevant
to
the
end
of
the
story
and
if
this
record
had
been
in
the
hands
of
certain
persons
the
end
of
the
story
might
have
been
different
i
do
not
know
certainly
it
ought
to
have
been
different
anyhow
harry
came
to
france
and
found
us
in
the
line
at
souchez
the
recuperative
power
of
the
young
soldier
is
very
marvellous
no
one
but
myself
would
have
said
that
this
was
not
the
same
harry
of
a
year
ago
for
he
was
fit
and
fresh
and
bubbling
over
with
keenness
only
myself
who
had
sat
over
the
dardanelles
with
him
and
talked
about
troy
knew
what
was
missing
there
were
no
more
romantic
illusions
about
war
and
i
think
no
more
military
ambitions
only
he
was
sufficiently
rested
to
be
very
keen
again
and
had
not
yet
seen
enough
of
it
to
be
ordinarily
bored
and
in
that
summer
of
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
life
in
the
souchez
sector
it
was
a
sector
where
divisions
stayed
for
months
at
a
time
and
one
went
in
and
out
like
clockwork
at
ritual
intervals
each
time
into
the
same
trenches
the
same
deep
each
time
back
to
the
same
billets
or
the
same
huts
in
the
same
wood
all
the
deserted
fields
about
the
line
were
a
mass
of
poppies
and
cornflowers
and
they
hung
over
one
in
extravagant
masses
as
one
walked
up
the
communication
trench
in
the
thick
woods
round
bouvigny
and
noulette
there
were
clusters
of
huts
where
the
resting
time
was
very
warm
and
lazy
and
companionable
with
much
white
wine
and
singing
in
the
evenings
or
one
took
a
horse
and
rode
into
coupigny
or
barlin
where
there
had
not
been
too
much
war
but
one
could
dine
happily
at
the
best
estaminet
and
then
ride
back
contentedly
under
the
stars
in
the
line
also
there
was
not
too
much
war
few
of
the
infantry
on
either
side
ever
fired
their
rifles
and
only
a
few
bombers
with
rifle
grenades
tried
to
injure
the
enemy
there
were
short
sectors
of
the
line
on
either
side
which
became
spasmodically
dangerous
because
of
these
things
and
at
a
fixed
hour
each
day
the
germans
blew
the
same
portions
of
the
line
to
dust
with
minenwerfers
our
men
having
departed
elsewhere
half
an
hour
previously
according
to
the
established
routine
from
which
neither
side
ever
diverged
our
guns
were
very
busy
by
spasms
and
every
day
destroyed
small
sections
of
the
thick
red
masses
of
the
german
wire
which
were
every
night
religiously
repaired
the
german
guns
were
very
few
for
the
somme
battle
was
raging
but
at
times
they
flung
vaguely
about
the
line
or
dropped
big
shells
on
the
great
brows
of
the
lorette
heights
behind
us
from
the
high
ground
we
held
there
was
a
good
view
with
woods
and
red
and
white
villages
on
the
far
hills
beyond
the
germans
and
away
to
the
left
one
looked
over
the
battered
pit
country
towards
lens
with
everywhere
the
tall
all
crumpled
and
bent
into
uncouth
shapes
and
grey
rising
like
the
pyramids
out
of
a
wilderness
of
broken
red
cottages
to
the
began
the
vimy
ridge
where
the
red
pimple
frowned
over
the
lines
at
the
lorette
heights
and
all
day
there
was
the
foam
and
blackness
of
bursting
shells
in
the
night
there
was
much
patrolling
and
bursts
of
fire
and
a
few
snipers
and
enormous
labours
at
the
of
the
line
wiring
and
revetting
and
exquisite
work
with
it
was
all
very
gentle
and
friendly
and
artificial
and
we
were
happy
together
burnett
had
left
us
on
some
detached
duty
or
other
and
in
that
gentler
atmosphere
eustace
was
a
good
companion
again
men
grew
lusty
and
well
and
one
could
have
continued
there
indefinitely
without
much
injury
to
body
or
mind
but
sometimes
on
a
clear
night
we
saw
all
the
southern
sky
afire
from
some
new
madness
on
the
somme
and
knew
that
somewhere
in
france
there
was
real
war
the
correspondents
wrote
home
that
the
regiments
so
long
to
the
deadening
inactivity
of
trench
warfare
were
longing
only
for
their
turn
at
the
great
battle
no
doubt
they
had
authority
though
i
never
met
one
of
those
regiments
for
our
part
we
were
happy
where
we
were
we
had
had
enough
for
the
present
iii
but
i
digress
and
yet
no
for
i
want
you
to
keep
this
idea
of
the
diversity
of
war
conditions
before
you
and
how
a
man
may
be
in
a
fighting
unit
for
many
months
and
yet
go
unscathed
even
in
spirit
or
in
the
most
arcadian
parts
of
the
battle
area
he
may
come
alone
against
some
peculiar
shock
from
which
he
never
recovers
it
is
all
chance
we
made
harry
scout
officer
again
and
he
was
very
keen
between
us
and
the
german
lines
was
a
honeycomb
of
old
disused
trenches
where
french
and
germans
had
fought
for
many
months
before
they
sat
down
to
watch
each
other
across
this
maze
they
were
all
overgrown
now
with
flowers
and
thick
grasses
but
for
the
purposes
of
future
operations
it
was
important
to
know
all
about
them
and
every
night
harry
wriggled
out
and
dropped
into
one
of
these
to
creep
and
explore
and
afterwards
put
them
on
the
map
sometimes
i
went
a
little
way
with
him
and
i
did
not
like
it
it
was
very
creepy
in
those
forgotten
alleys
worse
than
crawling
outside
in
the
open
i
think
because
of
the
intense
blackness
and
the
infinite
possibilities
of
ambush
the
boches
we
knew
were
playing
the
same
game
as
ourselves
and
might
always
be
round
the
next
traverse
so
that
every
ten
yards
one
went
through
a
new
ordeal
of
expectancy
and
stealthy
strained
investigation
one
stood
breathless
at
the
corner
listening
peering
quivering
with
the
strain
of
it
and
then
a
rat
dropped
into
the
next
or
behind
us
one
of
our
lewis
guns
blazed
off
a
few
bursts
shattering
the
silence
surely
there
was
some
one
near
moving
hurriedly
under
cover
of
the
noise
then
you
stood
again
stiff
and
cramped
with
the
stillness
and
you
wanted
insanely
to
cough
or
shift
your
weight
on
to
the
other
foot
or
your
nose
itched
and
the
grasses
tickled
your
ear
but
you
must
not
stir
must
hardly
breathe
for
now
all
the
lines
have
become
mysteriously
hushed
and
no
man
fires
far
away
one
can
hear
the
rumble
of
the
german
limbers
coming
up
with
rations
to
the
dump
and
the
quiet
becomes
unbearable
so
that
you
long
for
some
titanic
explosion
to
break
it
and
set
you
free
from
waiting
then
a
opens
again
and
you
slip
round
the
corner
to
find
nothing
at
all
only
more
blackness
and
the
rats
scuttling
away
into
the
grass
and
perhaps
the
bones
of
a
frenchman
and
then
you
begin
all
over
again
when
he
has
done
this
sort
of
thing
many
times
without
any
happening
an
imperfect
scout
becomes
careless
through
sheer
weariness
and
begins
to
blunder
noisily
ahead
and
sooner
or
later
he
goes
under
but
harry
was
a
natural
scout
well
trained
and
from
first
to
last
kept
the
same
care
the
same
admirable
patience
and
this
means
a
great
strain
on
body
and
mind
in
those
old
trenches
you
could
go
right
up
to
the
german
line
two
hundred
yards
away
and
this
harry
often
did
the
germans
had
small
posts
at
these
points
waiting
and
were
very
ready
with
bombs
and
rifle
grenades
it
was
a
poor
if
you
were
heard
about
there
and
perhaps
badly
wounded
so
that
you
could
not
move
two
hundred
yards
away
from
friends
and
all
those
happy
soldiers
who
spent
their
nights
comfortably
in
trenches
when
you
were
out
there
on
your
stomach
perhaps
your
companion
would
get
away
and
bring
help
or
he
too
might
be
hit
or
killed
and
then
you
would
lie
there
for
days
and
nights
alone
in
a
dark
hole
with
the
rats
scampering
and
smelling
about
you
till
you
died
of
starvation
or
loss
of
blood
you
would
lie
there
listening
to
your
own
men
chattering
in
the
distance
at
their
wiring
and
neither
they
nor
any
one
would
find
you
or
know
where
you
were
till
months
hence
some
other
venturesome
scout
stumbled
on
your
revolver
in
the
dark
or
maybe
the
line
would
advance
at
last
and
some
salvage
party
come
upon
your
uniform
rotting
in
the
ditch
and
they
would
take
off
your
identity
disk
and
send
it
in
to
headquarters
and
shovel
a
little
earth
above
your
bones
it
might
be
many
years
i
am
not
an
imaginative
man
but
that
was
the
kind
of
thought
i
had
while
i
prowled
round
with
harry
and
i
never
went
so
far
as
he
he
even
had
an
occasional
jest
at
the
germans
and
once
planted
an
old
dummy
close
up
to
their
lines
there
was
stony
ground
there
and
as
they
took
it
there
he
told
me
it
clattered
the
next
night
he
went
there
again
in
case
the
germans
came
out
to
capture
they
did
not
but
every
evening
for
many
months
they
put
a
barrage
of
all
about
that
dummy
then
there
was
much
talk
of
and
all
the
opposite
wire
had
to
be
patrolled
and
examined
for
gaps
and
weak
places
this
meant
crawling
in
the
open
close
up
to
the
enemy
naked
under
the
white
flares
and
sometimes
they
fell
to
earth
within
a
few
feet
of
a
scout
and
sizzled
brilliantly
for
interminable
seconds
there
was
a
sniper
somewhere
near
and
perhaps
a
section
and
surely
they
could
see
him
so
large
so
illuminated
so
monstrously
visible
he
felt
it
was
easy
when
there
was
not
too
much
quiet
but
many
echoes
of
scattered
shots
and
the
noise
of
bullets
rocketing
into
space
or
long
bursts
of
fire
to
cover
your
movements
but
when
that
terrible
silence
fell
it
was
very
difficult
for
then
how
loud
was
the
rustle
of
your
stealthiest
wriggle
how
sinister
the
tiny
sounds
of
insects
in
the
grass
everywhere
there
were
stray
strands
of
old
barbed
wire
which
caught
in
your
clothes
and
needed
infinite
patience
to
disentangle
when
you
got
rid
of
one
barb
another
clung
to
you
as
the
wire
sprang
back
or
if
you
were
not
skilful
it
clashed
on
a
post
or
a
rifle
or
a
tin
can
with
a
noise
like
cymbals
you
came
across
strange
things
as
you
crawled
out
there
dead
bodies
and
bits
of
equipment
and
huge
unexploded
shells
or
you
touched
a
rat
or
a
that
made
you
shiver
as
it
moved
the
rats
and
the
ran
over
you
if
you
lay
still
for
long
and
once
harry
saw
a
german
sniffing
busily
in
front
of
him
sometimes
as
you
went
up
wind
you
put
your
hand
suddenly
on
a
dead
man
and
had
to
lie
close
beside
him
for
cover
or
you
scented
him
far
off
like
a
dog
nosing
through
the
grass
and
made
him
a
landmark
whispering
to
your
companion
fifty
yards
from
the
dead
or
for
the
dead
boche
when
the
lights
went
up
you
lay
very
close
peering
ahead
under
your
cap
and
as
they
fell
away
to
the
ground
all
your
vision
became
full
of
moving
things
and
fugitive
shadows
the
thick
rows
of
wiring
posts
looked
like
men
working
and
that
cluster
of
stones
like
the
head
of
a
man
in
a
watching
watching
you
gone
in
an
instant
then
you
waited
tensely
for
the
next
light
there
is
the
murmur
of
voices
somewhere
very
difficult
to
locate
for
a
long
while
you
stalk
it
ready
to
attack
some
patrol
some
then
you
hear
a
familiar
tyneside
curse
it
is
a
company
wiring
with
much
noise
all
this
as
i
have
said
is
a
heavy
strain
on
mind
and
body
and
nerve
it
requires
a
peculiar
kind
of
courage
a
lonely
kind
of
courage
many
men
who
would
do
well
in
a
fight
in
the
light
of
day
are
useless
as
scouts
not
only
are
they
noisy
and
impatient
but
they
can
not
stand
it
and
yet
it
is
no
job
for
a
very
imaginative
man
there
are
too
many
things
you
can
imagine
if
you
once
begin
the
more
you
know
about
it
the
more
there
is
to
imagine
and
the
greater
the
strain
becomes
now
harry
had
a
very
vivid
imagination
and
he
knew
all
about
it
and
yet
he
played
this
game
nearly
every
night
we
were
in
the
line
for
three
months
nothing
theatrical
you
understand
nor
even
heroic
by
popular
standards
no
stabbing
affrays
no
medals
but
by
my
standards
it
very
nearly
heroic
and
i
do
know
how
he
did
it
but
this
was
forgotten
later
on
iv
then
harry
had
a
shock
there
was
a
large
sap
running
out
from
our
line
along
the
crown
of
a
steep
ridge
this
sap
was
not
held
during
the
day
but
at
night
was
peopled
with
bombers
and
snipers
and
it
was
a
great
for
the
patrols
one
night
harry
went
out
from
this
sap
and
crawled
down
the
face
of
the
ridge
it
was
a
dark
night
and
the
boches
were
throwing
up
many
flares
one
of
these
came
to
earth
ten
yards
from
harry
at
that
moment
he
was
halfway
down
the
slope
crouched
on
one
knee
however
when
flares
are
about
to
keep
still
in
any
posture
is
better
than
to
move
so
harry
remained
rigid
but
one
of
the
new
scouts
behind
was
just
leaving
the
sap
and
hovered
uncertainly
on
the
skyline
as
the
light
flared
and
sizzled
below
possibly
he
was
seen
possibly
what
followed
was
a
chance
freak
of
the
germans
anyhow
a
moment
later
they
opened
with
every
in
the
line
with
rifles
and
shells
so
venomous
was
the
fire
that
every
man
in
the
line
believed
and
afterwards
hotly
asserted
that
the
whole
fury
of
it
was
concentrated
on
his
particular
yard
of
trench
few
of
us
thought
of
the
unhappy
scouts
lying
naked
outside
harry
of
course
flattened
himself
to
the
ground
and
tried
to
wriggle
into
a
hollow
on
level
ground
you
may
with
luck
be
safe
under
wild
fire
of
this
kind
for
a
long
time
being
on
a
slope
harry
was
hopelessly
exposed
lay
there
he
told
me
simply
sweated
with
funk
you
wo
believe
me
but
at
one
time
i
could
literally
a
stream
of
bullets
ruffling
my
hair
and
thudding
into
the
bank
just
above
my
back
and
they
dropped
half
a
dozen
just
in
front
of
me
while
it
was
going
on
i
could
have
moved
for
a
thousand
pounds
i
felt
to
the
ground
then
there
was
a
lull
and
i
leapt
up
so
did
old
smith
bolted
for
the
sap
and
simply
dived
in
head
first
they
were
still
blazing
off
sixteen
to
the
dozen
and
it
was
the
mercy
of
god
we
were
hit
talk
about
and
when
we
got
in
two
bombers
thought
it
was
an
attack
and
took
us
for
boches
rather
funny
while
the
strafe
was
going
on
i
kept
thinking
poor
old
smith
he
a
married
man
he
was
a
few
yards
from
me
and
smith
tells
me
was
thinking
penrose
a
married
man
married
man
what
about
some
more
whisky
well
he
made
a
joke
of
it
as
one
tries
to
do
as
long
as
possible
and
that
night
was
almost
happily
exhilarated
as
a
man
sometimes
is
after
escaping
narrowly
from
an
adventure
but
i
could
see
that
it
had
been
a
severe
shock
the
next
night
he
had
a
cold
and
a
bad
cough
and
said
he
would
not
go
out
for
fear
of
a
noise
and
giving
the
show
away
the
following
night
he
went
out
but
came
in
very
soon
and
sat
rather
glum
in
the
thinking
of
something
i
always
waited
up
till
he
came
in
to
report
and
we
used
to
the
situation
over
some
whisky
or
a
little
white
wine
the
following
day
the
colonel
gave
him
a
special
job
to
do
there
was
the
usual
talk
of
a
on
a
certain
section
of
the
enemy
lines
but
there
was
a
theory
that
this
particular
section
had
been
evacuated
flares
were
sent
up
from
all
parts
of
it
but
this
was
supposed
to
be
the
work
of
one
man
a
hard
worker
who
walked
steadily
up
and
down
pretending
to
be
a
company
harry
was
told
off
to
test
the
truth
of
this
myth
to
get
right
up
to
that
trench
to
look
in
and
see
what
was
in
it
it
was
a
thing
he
had
done
twice
before
at
least
though
myself
i
should
not
have
cared
to
do
it
at
all
it
meant
the
usual
breathless
toilsome
wriggle
across
no
man
land
avoiding
the
flares
and
the
two
snipers
who
covered
that
bit
of
ground
finding
a
gap
in
the
wire
getting
through
without
being
seen
without
noise
without
catching
his
clothes
on
a
wandering
barb
or
banging
his
revolver
against
a
multitude
of
tin
cans
then
you
had
to
listen
and
wait
and
if
possible
get
a
look
into
the
trench
when
and
if
you
had
done
that
you
had
to
get
back
turn
round
in
a
tiny
space
pass
the
same
obstacles
the
same
snipers
if
at
any
stage
you
were
spotted
the
odds
against
your
getting
back
at
all
were
extremely
large
however
harry
was
a
scout
and
it
was
his
job
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
i
met
him
somewhere
in
the
line
and
made
some
jocular
remark
about
his
night
work
he
seemed
to
me
a
little
worried
preoccupied
and
answered
shortly
hewett
was
sitting
near
shaving
in
the
sun
and
said
to
him
a
nasty
fellow
harry
crawling
about
like
a
young
snake
every
night
but
i
suppose
you
like
it
harry
said
slowly
with
a
casual
air
so
i
did
but
i
must
say
that
strafe
the
other
night
put
the
wind
up
me
properly
and
when
i
went
out
last
night
i
found
i
was
thinking
all
the
time
suppose
they
did
that
again
and
when
i
got
on
the
top
of
a
ridge
or
anywhere
a
bit
exposed
i
kept
imagining
what
it
would
be
like
if
all
those
started
just
then
simply
dashed
into
a
and
i
found
myself
working
for
safe
spots
where
one
would
be
all
right
in
case
of
accidents
sort
of
lost
confidence
you
know
it
was
all
said
in
a
manner
as
if
he
was
saying
do
like
marmalade
so
much
as
i
used
to
do
and
there
was
no
suggestion
that
he
was
not
ready
to
go
and
look
in
the
boche
front
line
or
the
unter
den
linden
if
necessary
but
i
was
sorry
about
this
i
told
him
that
he
must
not
imagine
that
that
strafe
was
an
unique
affair
never
likely
to
be
repeated
but
when
i
went
back
to
the
i
spoke
to
the
colonel
that
night
i
went
up
with
harry
to
foster
alley
and
watched
him
writhing
away
into
the
grey
gloom
there
were
many
stars
and
you
could
follow
him
for
thirty
yards
and
as
i
watched
i
wondered
he
thinking
they
do
that
again
and
when
he
gets
over
near
the
wire
will
he
be
thinking
would
happen
if
they
saw
me
now
if
so
i
said
help
him
and
went
back
to
headquarters
three
hours
later
he
came
into
the
where
i
sat
with
the
colonel
making
out
an
intelligence
report
he
was
very
white
and
tired
and
while
he
spoke
to
the
colonel
he
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
muddy
steps
with
his
head
just
out
of
the
candlelight
all
the
front
of
his
tunic
was
muddy
and
there
were
two
rents
in
his
breeches
he
said
sorry
sir
but
i
could
get
through
i
got
pretty
close
to
the
wire
but
could
find
a
gap
there
much
firing
said
the
colonel
usual
two
snipers
and
a
on
the
left
from
what
i
heard
i
should
say
there
were
a
good
many
men
in
that
part
of
the
trench
but
i
could
swear
now
what
the
colonel
had
wanted
was
somebody
who
swear
that
was
what
the
brigade
wanted
so
he
was
not
pleased
but
he
was
a
kind
understanding
fellow
and
all
he
said
was
i
sorry
too
penrose
but
no
doubt
you
did
your
best
and
he
went
to
bed
then
i
opened
some
perrier
we
still
had
perrier
then
and
gave
harry
a
strong
whisky
and
waited
for
i
knew
that
there
was
more
he
talked
for
a
little
as
usual
about
the
mud
and
the
boche
line
and
so
on
and
then
he
said
i
told
the
colonel
was
perfectly
true
i
did
get
pretty
close
to
the
wire
and
there
was
a
gap
to
be
seen
but
that
was
the
whole
of
it
i
could
face
it
the
truth
is
that
show
the
other
night
was
too
much
for
me
i
found
myself
lying
in
a
pretending
to
myself
that
i
was
listening
and
watching
and
so
on
but
really
absolutely
stuck
trying
to
myself
go
on
and
i
could
i
finished
as
a
scout
that
all
well
it
was
all
for
the
present
no
thinking
human
is
going
to
run
a
man
in
for
being
beaten
by
a
job
like
that
it
is
a
affair
like
firing
a
gun
it
is
his
business
to
put
the
right
man
on
the
job
and
if
he
does
he
ca
complain
so
we
made
harry
lewis
gun
officer
and
that
was
the
first
stage
viii
soon
after
that
we
went
down
to
the
somme
it
was
autumn
then
and
all
that
desolate
area
of
stark
brown
earth
was
wet
and
heavy
and
stinking
down
the
ancre
valley
there
were
still
some
leaves
in
thiepval
wood
and
the
tall
trees
along
the
river
were
green
and
beautiful
in
the
thin
october
sun
but
the
centre
of
battle
was
coming
up
to
that
valley
in
a
month
the
green
was
all
gone
and
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
the
endless
uniform
landscape
of
tumbled
earth
and
splintered
trunks
and
only
the
big
shells
raising
vain
waterspouts
in
the
wide
pools
of
the
ancre
gave
any
brightness
to
the
tired
eye
but
you
know
about
all
this
every
englishman
has
a
picture
of
the
somme
in
his
mind
and
i
will
not
try
to
enlarge
it
we
were
glad
in
a
way
to
go
there
not
in
the
expectation
of
liking
it
but
on
the
principle
of
henry
speech
on
the
eve
of
crispin
we
saw
ourselves
in
hospitals
or
or
bars
saying
we
were
six
months
on
the
somme
as
indeed
we
were
we
were
going
to
be
the
swing
but
it
was
very
vile
after
souchez
it
was
real
war
again
and
many
souchez
reputations
wilted
there
and
died
yet
with
all
its
horror
and
discomfort
and
fear
that
winter
was
more
bearable
than
the
gallipoli
summer
for
at
the
worst
there
was
a
little
respite
spasms
of
repose
you
came
back
sometimes
to
billets
cold
bare
broken
houses
but
still
houses
where
you
might
make
a
brave
blaze
of
a
wood
fire
and
huddle
round
it
in
a
cheery
circle
with
warm
drinks
and
a
song
or
two
and
sometimes
there
were
estaminets
and
kind
french
women
or
you
went
far
back
to
an
old
château
perched
over
the
village
and
there
was
bridge
and
a
piano
and
guests
at
headquarters
civilization
was
within
reach
and
sometimes
you
had
a
glimpse
of
it
and
made
the
most
of
it
but
we
had
a
bad
time
as
every
one
did
after
a
stiff
three
weeks
of
holding
a
nasty
bit
of
the
line
much
digging
of
assembly
trenches
and
carrying
in
the
mud
we
took
our
part
in
a
great
battle
i
shall
not
tell
you
about
it
it
is
in
the
histories
but
it
was
a
black
day
for
the
battalion
we
lost
men
and
officers
more
than
twice
the
total
british
casualties
at
omdurman
hewett
was
killed
and
six
other
officers
the
colonel
and
twelve
more
were
wounded
eustace
showed
superb
courage
with
a
hideous
wound
harry
and
myself
survived
now
i
had
made
a
mistake
about
harry
after
that
scouting
episode
at
souchez
i
told
myself
that
his
was
gone
that
for
a
little
anyhow
he
would
be
no
good
in
action
but
soon
after
we
got
to
the
somme
he
had
surprised
me
by
doing
a
very
good
piece
of
work
under
fire
we
were
digging
a
new
line
in
no
man
land
two
hundred
men
at
work
at
once
they
were
spotted
the
boches
dropped
some
minnies
about
and
there
was
the
beginnings
of
a
slight
stampede
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
mythical
orders
to
came
along
all
harry
did
was
to
get
the
men
back
and
keep
them
together
and
keep
them
digging
the
officer
job
but
he
did
very
well
and
to
me
as
i
say
surprisingly
well
the
truth
was
as
i
afterwards
perceived
that
only
what
i
may
call
his
nerve
was
gone
it
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
as
i
have
tried
to
show
and
losing
it
he
had
lost
a
very
valuable
quality
but
that
was
all
at
present
or
i
may
put
it
another
way
there
is
a
theory
held
among
soldiers
which
i
will
call
the
theory
of
the
favourite
fear
every
civilian
has
his
favourite
fear
death
by
burning
or
by
drowning
the
fear
of
falling
from
a
great
height
or
being
mangled
in
a
machine
something
which
it
makes
us
shiver
to
think
about
among
soldiers
such
special
fears
are
even
more
acute
though
less
openly
confessed
but
in
the
evenings
men
will
sometimes
lie
on
the
straw
in
the
smoky
barns
and
whisper
the
things
of
which
they
are
most
afraid
it
is
largely
a
matter
of
locality
and
circumstance
in
gallipoli
where
the
turks
rapid
musketry
fire
was
almost
incredibly
intense
and
their
snipers
uncannily
accurate
men
would
say
that
they
hated
bullets
but
left
them
unmoved
the
same
men
travelled
to
france
and
found
rifle
fire
practically
extinct
but
increasingly
terrible
and
rapidly
reversed
their
opinions
more
often
however
there
has
been
some
particular
experience
which
out
of
a
multitude
of
shocks
has
been
able
to
make
a
lasting
impression
and
leave
behind
it
the
favourite
fear
one
man
remembers
the
death
of
a
friend
caught
by
the
gas
without
his
gas
mask
and
is
possessed
with
the
fear
that
he
may
one
day
forget
his
own
and
perish
in
the
same
agony
and
such
is
the
effect
on
conduct
of
these
obsessions
that
this
man
will
neglect
the
most
ordinary
precautions
against
other
dangers
will
be
reckless
under
heavy
but
will
not
move
an
inch
without
his
respirator
with
others
it
is
the
fear
of
being
left
to
die
between
the
lines
caught
on
the
wire
and
riddled
by
both
sides
the
fear
of
snipers
of
even
of
one
man
feels
safe
in
the
open
but
in
the
strongest
has
a
horror
that
it
may
be
blown
in
upon
him
there
is
the
fear
of
the
empty
trench
where
like
a
child
on
the
dark
staircase
another
man
is
convinced
that
there
are
enemies
lying
behind
the
parapet
ready
to
leap
upon
him
and
there
is
the
horror
of
being
killed
on
the
way
down
from
the
line
after
a
relief
but
most
to
be
pitied
of
all
the
men
i
have
known
was
one
who
had
served
at
gallipoli
in
the
early
days
few
men
then
could
have
an
orderly
burial
in
a
recognized
ground
but
often
the
buried
them
hastily
where
they
could
in
and
about
the
lines
this
fear
was
that
one
day
a
sniper
would
get
him
in
the
head
that
unskilled
companions
would
pronounce
his
death
sentence
and
that
he
would
wake
up
perhaps
within
a
few
yards
of
his
own
trench
and
know
that
he
was
buried
but
not
dead
that
was
how
it
was
with
harry
the
one
thing
he
could
not
face
at
present
was
crawling
lonely
in
the
dark
with
the
thought
of
that
tornado
of
bullets
in
his
head
nothing
else
frightened
him
now
more
than
it
frightened
the
rest
of
us
though
god
knows
that
was
enough
so
that
he
did
quite
well
in
this
battle
in
a
sound
undistinguished
way
he
commanded
a
platoon
for
the
occasion
and
took
them
through
the
worst
part
of
the
show
without
exceptional
losses
and
he
got
as
far
as
any
of
the
regiment
got
he
held
out
there
for
two
days
under
very
heavy
with
a
mixed
lot
of
men
from
several
battalions
and
a
couple
of
strange
officers
in
the
evening
of
the
second
day
we
were
to
be
relieved
and
being
now
in
command
i
sent
him
down
with
a
runner
to
brigade
headquarters
to
fix
up
a
few
points
about
our
position
and
the
relief
there
was
a
terrific
barrage
to
pass
but
both
of
them
got
through
when
his
business
was
done
he
started
back
to
rejoin
the
battalion
by
that
time
it
was
about
eleven
at
night
and
the
relief
was
just
beginning
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
have
come
back
at
all
indeed
the
brigade
major
told
him
he
had
better
not
had
better
wait
there
in
the
warm
and
join
us
as
we
passed
down
now
when
a
man
has
been
through
a
two
days
battle
of
this
kind
has
had
no
sleep
and
hardly
any
food
for
two
days
and
finished
up
with
a
trudge
over
a
stony
wilderness
of
through
a
vicious
barrage
of
heavy
shells
when
after
all
this
he
finds
himself
worn
and
exhausted
so
that
he
can
hardly
stand
but
safe
and
comfortable
in
a
deep
where
there
are
friendly
lights
and
the
soothing
voices
of
calm
men
and
when
he
has
the
choice
of
staying
there
the
right
side
of
the
barrage
till
it
is
time
to
go
out
to
rest
or
of
going
back
through
that
same
barrage
staggering
into
the
same
with
the
immediate
prospect
doing
it
all
over
again
with
men
to
look
after
as
well
as
well
the
temptation
is
almost
irresistible
but
harry
did
resist
it
i
ca
tell
you
how
and
he
started
back
the
barrage
was
worse
than
ever
all
down
the
valley
road
and
apparently
when
they
came
near
the
most
dangerous
part
harry
runner
was
hit
by
a
big
splinter
and
blown
twenty
yards
there
were
no
stretchers
unoccupied
for
five
miles
and
it
was
evident
that
the
boy
he
was
only
a
kid
would
die
in
a
little
time
he
knew
it
himself
but
he
was
very
frightened
in
that
hideous
valley
where
the
shells
still
fell
and
he
begged
harry
not
to
leave
him
and
so
we
came
upon
them
as
we
stumbled
down
thanking
our
stars
we
were
through
the
worst
of
it
harry
and
the
runner
crouched
together
in
a
with
the
heart
of
the
barrage
blazing
and
roaring
sixty
yards
off
and
stray
shells
all
round
from
a
military
or
indeed
a
point
of
view
it
was
a
futile
performance
the
needless
risk
of
a
valuable
officer
life
they
do
not
give
decorations
for
that
kind
of
thing
but
i
was
glad
he
had
stayed
with
that
young
runner
and
i
only
tell
you
this
to
show
you
how
wrong
i
was
and
how
much
stuff
he
had
in
him
still
ii
and
now
colonel
philpott
comes
into
the
story
i
wish
to
god
he
had
kept
out
of
it
altogether
he
was
one
of
a
class
of
officer
with
which
our
division
was
specially
afflicted
at
least
we
believed
so
if
only
for
the
credit
of
the
british
army
for
if
they
were
typical
of
the
old
army
i
do
not
know
how
we
came
out
of
with
as
much
honour
as
we
did
but
i
am
happy
to
think
they
were
not
we
called
them
the
old
duds
and
we
believed
that
for
some
forgotten
sin
of
ours
or
because
of
a
certain
strong
spirit
we
had
they
were
dumped
upon
us
by
way
of
penalty
we
had
peculiarly
few
regular
officers
and
so
perhaps
were
inclined
to
be
extra
critical
of
these
gentlemen
anyhow
at
one
time
they
came
in
swarms
lazy
stupid
ignorant
men
with
many
years
of
service
retired
reserve
or
what
not
but
no
discoverable
distinction
either
in
intellect
or
character
or
action
and
when
they
had
told
us
about
simla
and
all
the
injustices
they
had
suffered
in
the
matter
of
promotion
or
pay
they
ousted
some
young
and
vigorous
temporary
fellow
who
at
least
knew
something
of
fighting
if
there
were
stray
passages
in
the
king
regulations
which
he
did
not
know
by
heart
and
in
about
a
week
their
commands
were
discontented
and
slack
in
about
two
months
they
were
evacuated
sick
for
they
had
no
most
of
them
and
that
was
the
finest
moment
of
their
careers
for
them
and
for
us
philpott
substantive
captain
after
god
knows
how
many
years
them
all
though
to
give
him
his
due
he
had
more
staying
power
than
most
of
them
he
took
over
the
battalion
when
colonel
roberts
was
wounded
and
the
contrast
was
painfully
acute
i
was
his
adjutant
for
twelve
months
in
all
and
an
adjutant
knows
most
things
about
his
he
was
a
short
stoutish
fellow
with
beady
eyes
and
an
unsuccessful
moustache
slightly
grey
like
a
at
dawn
he
had
all
the
exaggerated
respect
for
authority
and
his
superiors
of
the
regular
with
none
of
its
sincerity
for
while
he
said
things
about
the
brigadier
which
no
colonel
should
say
before
a
junior
officer
he
positively
cringed
when
they
met
and
though
he
bullied
defaulters
and
blustered
about
his
independence
before
juniors
there
was
no
superior
military
goose
to
whom
he
would
have
said
the
most
diffident
he
was
lazy
beyond
words
physically
and
mentally
but
to
see
him
double
out
of
the
mess
when
a
general
visited
the
village
was
an
education
it
made
one
want
to
vomit
then
of
course
he
believed
very
strongly
in
book
not
holy
writ
but
all
that
mass
of
small
red
publications
which
expound
the
whole
art
of
being
a
soldier
in
a
style
calculated
to
invest
with
mystery
the
most
obvious
truths
says
it
in
the
book
was
his
great
gambit
and
a
good
one
too
yet
he
betrayed
the
most
astonishing
ignorance
of
the
book
any
second
lieutenant
could
have
turned
him
inside
out
in
two
minutes
on
field
service
regulations
and
just
where
you
expected
him
to
be
really
efficient
and
knowledgeable
the
conduct
of
trials
and
military
law
and
so
on
he
made
the
most
hideous
elementary
howlers
but
ignorance
is
easily
forgivable
if
a
man
will
work
if
a
man
will
learn
but
he
would
neither
he
left
everything
to
somebody
else
the
the
adjutant
the
he
would
not
say
what
he
wanted
he
very
seldom
knew
and
when
in
despair
you
made
out
his
orders
for
him
he
invariably
disagreed
when
he
disagreed
he
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
without
being
so
clever
when
he
did
agree
it
took
half
an
hour
to
explain
the
simplest
arrangement
if
you
asked
him
to
sign
some
correspondence
for
the
brigade
he
was
too
lazy
and
told
you
to
sign
it
yourself
and
when
you
did
that
he
apologized
to
the
brigade
for
the
irregularities
of
his
adjutant
temporary
fellow
you
know
for
he
had
an
contempt
for
all
temporaries
and
that
was
perhaps
one
reason
why
we
disliked
him
so
much
he
would
not
believe
that
a
young
officer
who
had
not
spent
twenty
years
drinking
in
could
have
any
military
value
whatever
moreover
it
annoyed
him
intensely
and
here
he
had
my
sympathy
to
see
such
men
enjoying
the
same
pay
or
rank
as
he
had
enjoyed
during
the
almost
apocryphal
period
of
his
captaincy
and
having
himself
learned
practically
nothing
during
that
long
it
was
inconceivable
to
him
that
any
man
however
vigorous
or
intelligent
could
have
learned
anything
in
two
years
of
war
now
let
me
repeat
that
i
do
not
believe
him
to
be
typical
of
the
old
army
i
know
he
was
not
thank
god
but
this
is
a
history
of
what
happened
to
harry
and
colonel
philpott
was
one
of
the
things
which
happened
very
forcibly
so
i
give
him
to
you
as
we
found
him
and
since
he
may
be
alive
i
may
say
that
his
name
is
fictitious
though
there
are
unhappily
so
many
of
him
alive
that
i
have
no
fears
that
he
will
recognize
himself
he
would
not
be
the
same
man
if
he
did
we
went
out
for
a
fortnight
rest
after
that
battle
and
harry
had
trouble
with
him
almost
at
once
he
had
amused
and
irritated
harry
from
the
first
the
old
duds
always
did
for
his
respect
for
authority
was
very
civilian
and
youthful
in
character
he
took
a
man
for
what
he
was
and
if
he
decided
he
was
good
stood
by
him
loyally
for
ever
after
if
he
did
not
he
was
severe
not
to
say
intolerant
and
regrettably
lacking
in
that
veneration
for
the
old
and
incapable
which
is
the
soul
of
military
discipline
philpott
arrogance
on
the
subject
of
temporaries
annoyed
him
intensely
it
annoyed
us
all
and
this
i
think
it
was
that
made
him
say
a
very
unfortunate
thing
he
was
up
before
the
with
some
trifling
request
or
other
i
forget
what
and
somehow
the
question
of
his
seniority
and
service
came
up
incidentally
harry
remarked
quite
mildly
that
he
believed
he
was
nearly
due
for
promotion
colonel
philpott
gave
as
close
an
imitation
of
a
lively
man
as
i
ever
saw
him
achieve
he
nearly
had
a
fit
i
forget
all
he
said
he
thundered
for
a
long
time
banging
his
fist
on
the
king
regulations
and
knocking
everything
off
the
rickety
table
but
this
was
the
climax
by
god
and
how
old
are
you
young
man
and
how
much
service
have
you
seen
let
me
tell
you
this
master
penrose
when
i
was
your
age
i
had
begun
to
about
promotion
and
i
did
fifteen
years
as
a
captain
fifteen
solid
years
i
do
wonder
said
harry
it
was
very
unfortunate
iii
when
we
went
back
to
the
line
harry
was
detailed
for
many
and
some
of
them
particularly
the
first
were
very
nasty
the
days
of
comfortable
walking
in
communication
trenches
were
over
we
were
in
captured
ground
churned
up
by
our
own
fire
and
all
communication
with
the
front
was
over
the
open
over
the
harry
was
told
off
to
take
a
carrying
rations
up
to
the
battalion
in
the
line
a
hundred
men
these
were
bad
jobs
to
do
it
meant
of
a
mile
along
an
uphill
road
heavily
shelled
then
there
was
a
mile
over
the
country
where
there
were
no
landmarks
or
duckboards
or
anything
to
guide
you
for
a
single
man
in
daylight
with
a
map
navigation
was
difficult
enough
in
this
uniform
wilderness
until
you
had
been
over
it
a
time
or
two
to
go
over
it
for
the
first
time
in
the
dark
with
a
hundred
men
carrying
heavy
loads
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
makes
men
transfer
to
the
flying
corps
harry
got
past
the
road
with
the
loss
of
three
men
only
there
at
any
rate
you
went
straight
ahead
however
slowly
but
when
he
left
the
road
his
real
troubles
began
it
was
pitch
dark
and
drizzling
and
the
way
was
still
uphill
with
those
unhappy
where
of
the
men
carried
two
heavy
sacks
of
bread
and
tinned
meat
and
other
food
and
the
rest
two
petrol
tins
of
water
or
a
jar
of
rum
or
rifle
oil
or
whale
oil
besides
a
rifle
and
a
bandolier
and
two
respirators
and
a
you
must
move
with
exquisite
slowness
or
you
will
lose
your
whole
party
in
a
hundred
yards
and
even
when
you
are
just
putting
one
foot
in
front
of
another
moving
so
slowly
that
it
maddens
you
there
are
halts
and
hitches
every
few
yards
a
man
misses
his
footing
and
slides
down
into
a
crater
with
his
awful
load
the
hole
is
full
of
foul
green
water
and
he
must
be
hauled
out
quickly
lest
he
drown
down
the
line
a
man
halts
to
ease
his
load
or
shift
his
rifle
or
scratch
his
nose
when
he
goes
on
he
can
see
no
one
ahead
of
him
and
the
cry
in
touch
comes
sullenly
up
to
the
front
or
you
cross
the
path
of
another
party
burdened
as
yours
in
the
dark
or
against
the
flaring
skyline
they
look
like
yours
bent
murky
shapes
with
bumps
upon
them
and
some
of
your
men
trail
off
with
the
other
party
and
though
you
pity
your
men
more
than
yourself
it
is
difficult
sometimes
to
be
gentle
with
them
difficult
not
to
yield
to
the
intense
exasperation
of
it
all
and
curse
foolishly
but
harry
was
good
with
his
men
and
they
stumbled
on
slipping
muttering
with
a
dull
ache
at
the
shoulders
and
a
dogged
rage
in
their
hearts
he
was
trying
to
steer
by
the
compass
and
he
was
aiming
for
a
point
given
him
on
the
map
the
rendezvous
for
the
party
he
was
to
meet
this
point
was
the
junction
of
three
trenches
but
as
all
trenches
thereabouts
had
been
so
blotted
out
as
to
be
almost
indistinguishable
from
casual
it
was
not
so
good
a
rendezvous
as
it
had
seemed
to
the
brigade
however
harry
managed
to
find
it
or
believed
that
he
had
found
it
for
in
that
murk
and
blackness
nothing
was
certain
if
he
had
found
it
the
other
party
had
not
for
there
was
no
one
there
they
might
be
late
they
might
be
lost
they
might
be
waiting
elsewhere
so
harry
sent
out
a
scout
or
two
and
waited
while
the
men
lay
down
in
the
muddy
ruins
of
the
trench
and
dozed
unhappily
and
while
they
waited
the
boche
who
had
been
flinging
big
shells
about
at
random
since
dusk
took
it
into
his
head
to
plaster
these
old
trenches
with
harry
ran
or
floundered
along
the
line
telling
the
men
to
lie
close
where
they
were
there
was
indeed
nothing
else
to
do
but
it
gave
the
men
confidence
and
none
of
them
melted
away
as
he
ran
a
big
one
burst
very
near
and
knocked
him
flat
but
he
was
untouched
it
is
marvellous
how
local
the
effect
of
can
be
for
about
ten
minutes
they
had
a
bad
time
and
then
it
ceased
suddenly
and
now
was
one
of
those
crucial
moments
which
distinguish
a
good
officer
from
a
bad
or
even
an
ordinary
officer
it
was
easy
to
say
i
am
at
the
rendezvous
by
this
time
harry
had
got
his
bearings
a
little
by
the
lights
and
knew
he
was
in
the
right
spot
these
something
rations
the
men
are
done
and
a
bit
shaken
so
am
i
the
other
people
have
turned
up
if
they
want
their
rations
they
can
damned
well
come
here
and
get
them
i
done
my
part
and
i
going
home
but
a
real
good
officer
with
a
conscience
and
an
imagination
would
say
but
i
been
sent
up
here
to
get
these
rations
to
the
men
in
the
line
my
men
will
have
a
rest
and
some
sleep
and
some
good
food
the
men
in
the
line
now
will
still
be
in
the
line
with
no
sleep
and
little
rest
and
if
these
rations
are
left
here
in
the
mud
and
not
found
before
dawn
they
have
no
food
either
and
whatever
other
people
may
do
or
not
do
it
up
to
me
to
get
these
rations
up
there
somehow
if
we
have
to
walk
all
night
and
carry
them
right
up
to
the
front
line
ourselves
and
i
not
going
home
till
i
done
it
i
know
but
i
think
that
that
the
sort
of
thing
harry
said
to
himself
and
anyhow
after
the
row
with
philpott
he
was
particularly
anxious
to
make
good
so
he
got
his
men
out
and
told
them
about
it
all
and
they
floundered
on
it
was
raining
hard
now
with
a
bitter
wind
when
they
passed
the
crest
of
the
hill
harry
had
a
vague
idea
of
the
direction
of
the
line
so
long
as
they
were
on
the
slope
but
on
the
flat
when
they
had
dodged
round
a
few
hundred
halting
and
going
on
and
halting
again
all
sense
of
direction
departed
and
very
soon
they
were
hopelessly
lost
the
flares
were
no
good
for
the
line
curved
and
there
seemed
to
be
lights
all
around
going
up
mistily
through
the
rain
in
a
wide
circle
once
you
were
properly
lost
the
compass
was
useless
for
you
might
be
in
the
boche
lines
you
might
be
anywhere
at
such
moments
a
kind
of
mad
desperate
born
of
misery
and
weariness
and
rage
takes
hold
of
the
infantryman
and
if
he
carries
a
load
he
is
truly
ready
to
fall
down
and
sleep
where
he
is
or
die
and
in
the
wretched
youth
in
charge
there
is
a
sense
of
impotence
and
responsibility
that
makes
his
stomach
sink
within
him
some
of
the
men
began
to
growl
a
little
but
harry
held
on
despairingly
and
then
by
god
grace
they
ran
into
another
party
a
and
a
few
men
these
were
the
party
or
some
of
them
that
should
have
met
them
at
the
rendezvous
they
too
had
been
lost
and
were
now
wandering
back
to
the
line
well
harry
handed
over
the
rations
and
turned
home
well
pleased
with
himself
he
was
too
sick
of
the
whole
affair
and
it
was
too
dark
and
beastly
to
think
of
getting
a
receipt
it
was
a
pity
for
while
he
trudged
home
the
as
we
afterwards
heard
was
making
a
mess
of
the
whole
business
whether
he
had
not
enough
men
or
perhaps
lost
them
or
miscalculated
the
amount
of
rations
or
what
is
not
clear
but
half
of
all
that
precious
food
was
found
lying
in
the
mud
at
noon
the
next
day
when
it
was
too
late
and
half
the
battalion
in
the
line
went
very
short
then
the
colonel
rang
up
philpott
and
complained
bitterly
about
the
conduct
of
the
officer
in
charge
of
our
philpott
sent
for
harry
and
accused
him
hotly
of
dumping
the
rations
carelessly
anywhere
of
not
finishing
his
job
harry
gave
his
account
of
the
affair
quite
simply
without
enlarging
on
the
bad
time
he
had
had
though
that
was
clear
enough
to
a
man
with
any
knowledge
he
could
not
show
a
philpott
was
the
kind
of
man
who
valued
receipts
more
than
righteousness
he
refused
to
believe
harry
straightforward
tale
cursed
him
for
a
lazy
swine
and
sent
him
to
apologize
to
the
colonel
of
the
blanks
that
officer
did
listen
to
harry
story
believed
it
and
apologized
to
harry
was
a
little
soothed
but
from
that
day
i
know
there
was
a
great
bitterness
in
his
heart
for
he
had
done
a
difficult
job
very
well
and
had
come
back
justly
proud
of
himself
and
his
men
and
to
have
the
work
wasted
by
a
bungling
and
his
word
doubted
by
a
philpott
and
that
i
may
call
the
beginning
of
the
second
stage
ix
for
after
that
harry
began
to
be
in
a
bad
way
again
that
shelling
in
the
night
and
the
near
concussion
of
the
shell
that
knocked
him
over
had
been
one
of
those
capital
shocks
of
which
i
have
spoken
from
that
time
on
in
the
open
became
a
special
terror
a
new
favourite
fear
afterwards
he
told
me
so
and
all
that
winter
we
had
in
the
open
even
the
were
not
trenches
only
a
string
of
scattered
garrisoned
by
a
few
men
everywhere
night
and
day
you
had
that
naked
feeling
yet
in
france
at
the
worst
given
proper
rest
and
variety
with
a
chance
to
nurse
his
courage
and
soothe
his
nerves
a
resolute
man
could
struggle
on
a
long
time
after
he
began
to
crack
but
harry
had
no
rest
no
chance
the
was
having
a
rich
harvest
for
about
three
weeks
in
the
february
of
that
awful
winter
the
battalion
was
employed
solely
on
all
sorts
of
them
digging
carrying
behind
the
line
in
the
line
soft
jobs
terrible
jobs
now
as
adjutant
i
used
to
take
particular
care
that
the
safe
jobs
in
the
rear
should
be
fairly
shared
among
the
companies
in
a
rough
rotation
and
that
no
officers
or
men
should
have
too
many
of
the
bad
ones
the
night
to
the
front
line
but
about
now
colonel
philpott
began
to
exert
himself
about
these
parties
he
actually
issued
orders
about
the
arrangements
and
whether
by
accident
or
design
his
orders
had
this
particular
effect
that
harry
took
about
three
times
as
many
of
the
dangerous
parties
as
anybody
else
we
were
in
a
country
of
rolling
down
with
long
valleys
or
ravines
between
to
get
to
the
front
line
you
had
to
cross
two
of
these
valleys
and
in
each
of
them
the
boche
put
a
terrific
barrage
all
night
and
every
night
the
second
one
the
valley
of
death
was
about
as
near
to
inferno
as
i
wish
to
see
for
it
was
enfiladed
from
both
ends
and
you
had
from
three
directions
well
for
three
weeks
harry
took
a
party
through
this
valley
four
or
five
nights
a
week
each
party
meant
a
double
passage
through
two
corners
of
hell
with
a
string
of
weary
men
to
keep
together
and
encourage
and
command
with
all
that
maddening
accumulation
of
difficulties
i
have
tried
already
to
describe
and
at
the
end
of
that
winter
after
all
he
had
done
it
was
too
much
i
protested
to
the
colonel
but
it
was
no
good
penrose
can
go
on
with
these
parties
he
said
he
learns
how
to
do
them
properly
after
ten
days
of
this
harry
began
to
be
afraid
of
himself
or
as
he
put
it
do
know
if
i
can
stand
much
more
of
this
all
his
old
distrust
of
himself
which
lately
i
think
he
had
very
successfully
kept
away
came
creeping
back
but
he
made
no
complaint
he
did
not
ask
me
to
intercede
with
philpott
the
more
he
hated
and
feared
these
parties
the
worse
he
felt
the
keener
became
his
determination
to
stick
it
out
to
beat
philpott
at
his
own
game
or
so
i
imagine
for
by
the
third
week
there
was
no
doubt
what
is
called
his
was
clean
gone
or
as
he
put
it
to
me
in
the
soldier
tongue
got
complete
he
would
have
given
anything
except
his
pride
to
have
escaped
one
of
those
parties
he
thought
about
them
all
day
i
did
manage
in
sheer
defiance
of
philpott
to
take
him
off
one
of
them
but
it
was
only
sheer
dogged
and
perhaps
the
knowledge
that
we
were
to
be
relieved
the
following
week
which
carried
him
through
to
the
end
of
it
if
we
had
not
gone
out
i
do
know
what
would
have
happened
but
i
can
guess
ii
and
so
philpott
finally
broke
his
nerve
but
he
was
still
keen
and
resolute
to
go
on
in
spite
of
the
bitterness
in
his
heart
philpott
and
other
things
had
still
to
break
his
spirit
and
the
things
were
many
that
winter
it
was
a
long
cold
comfortless
winter
billets
became
more
and
more
broken
and
windowless
and
lousy
firewood
vanished
and
there
was
little
coal
on
the
high
slopes
there
was
a
bitter
wind
and
men
went
sick
in
hundreds
pneumonia
fever
all
were
damp
and
chilling
and
greasy
with
mud
or
full
of
the
acrid
that
tortured
the
eyes
there
were
night
advances
in
the
snow
where
lightly
wounded
men
perished
of
exposure
before
dawn
for
a
fortnight
we
lived
in
tents
on
a
covered
with
snow
and
one
day
harry
discovered
he
was
lousy
then
socially
though
it
seems
a
strange
thing
to
say
these
were
dull
days
for
harry
few
people
realize
how
much
an
infantryman
life
is
lightened
if
he
has
companions
of
his
own
kind
not
necessarily
of
the
same
class
though
it
usually
comes
to
that
but
of
the
same
tastes
and
education
and
experience
men
who
make
the
same
kind
of
jokes
in
the
line
it
matters
little
a
man
is
a
man
as
the
press
will
tell
you
but
in
the
evenings
out
at
rest
it
was
good
and
cheering
to
sit
with
the
old
crowd
and
exchange
old
stories
of
gallipoli
and
oxford
and
london
even
to
argue
with
eustace
about
the
public
schools
to
be
with
men
who
liked
the
same
songs
the
same
tunes
on
the
gramophone
who
did
not
always
ask
for
dixie
bird
or
green
woman
waltz
and
now
there
was
none
of
the
old
crowd
left
only
harry
and
myself
harry
with
a
company
now
and
myself
very
busy
at
headquarters
and
harry
company
were
very
dull
men
promoted
mostly
good
fellows
all
very
good
in
the
line
but
they
were
not
the
old
crowd
now
instead
of
those
great
evenings
we
used
to
have
with
the
white
wine
and
the
music
and
old
george
dancing
evenings
that
have
come
down
in
the
history
of
the
battalion
as
our
battles
have
done
evenings
that
kept
the
spirit
strong
in
the
blackest
times
there
were
morose
men
with
wooden
faces
sitting
silently
over
some
whisky
and
battalion
orders
and
hewett
was
dead
the
laughing
lovable
hewett
that
was
the
black
heart
of
it
when
a
man
becomes
part
of
the
great
machine
he
is
generally
supposed
i
know
not
why
to
surrender
with
his
body
his
soul
and
his
affections
and
all
his
human
tendernesses
but
it
is
not
so
we
never
talked
of
hewett
very
much
only
there
was
for
ever
a
great
gap
and
sometimes
when
we
tried
to
be
cheerful
in
the
evenings
as
in
the
old
times
and
were
not
we
said
to
each
other
harry
and
i
wish
to
god
that
he
was
here
yet
for
long
periods
i
forgot
hewett
harry
never
forgot
him
then
there
was
something
about
which
i
may
be
wrong
for
harry
never
mentioned
it
and
i
am
only
guessing
from
my
own
opinion
in
two
years
of
war
he
had
won
no
kind
of
medal
or
distinction
except
a
in
despatches
which
is
about
as
satisfying
as
a
to
a
starving
man
in
gallipoli
he
had
done
things
which
in
france
in
modern
times
would
have
earned
an
easy
decoration
but
they
were
scarce
in
those
days
and
in
france
he
had
done
much
dogged
and
difficult
work
and
a
few
very
courageous
but
in
a
military
sense
perfectly
useless
things
nothing
dramatic
nothing
to
catch
the
eye
of
the
brigade
i
do
know
whether
he
minded
much
but
i
felt
it
myself
very
keenly
for
i
knew
that
he
had
started
with
ambitions
and
here
were
fellows
with
not
half
his
service
or
courage
or
capacity
just
ordinary
men
with
luck
ablaze
with
ribbon
any
one
who
says
he
cares
nothing
about
medals
is
a
hypocrite
though
most
of
us
care
very
little
but
if
you
believe
you
have
done
well
and
not
only
is
there
nothing
to
show
for
it
but
nothing
to
show
that
other
people
believe
it
you
ca
help
caring
and
then
on
top
of
it
when
you
have
a
genuine
sense
of
bitter
injustice
when
you
know
that
your
own
most
modest
estimate
of
yourself
is
exalted
compared
with
the
estimate
of
the
man
who
commands
you
you
begin
to
have
black
moods
iii
harry
had
black
moods
all
these
torments
accumulated
and
broke
his
spirit
he
lost
his
keenness
his
cheerfulness
and
his
health
once
a
man
starts
on
that
path
his
past
history
finds
him
out
like
an
old
wound
some
men
take
to
drink
and
are
disgraced
in
harry
case
it
was
gallipoli
no
man
who
had
a
bad
time
in
that
place
ever
over
it
in
body
or
soul
and
when
france
or
some
other
campaign
began
to
work
upon
them
it
was
seen
that
there
was
something
missing
in
their
resisting
power
they
broke
out
with
old
diseases
and
old
fears
the
legacies
of
gallipoli
harry
grew
pale
and
nervous
and
hunted
to
look
at
and
he
had
a
touch
of
dysentery
but
the
worst
of
the
poison
was
in
his
mind
and
heart
for
a
long
time
as
i
have
said
since
he
felt
the
beginning
of
those
old
doubts
and
saw
himself
starting
downhill
he
had
striven
anxiously
to
keep
his
name
high
in
men
opinion
for
all
liked
him
and
believed
in
him
he
had
been
ready
for
anything
and
done
his
work
with
a
conscientious
pride
but
now
this
bitterness
was
on
him
he
seemed
to
have
ceased
to
care
what
happened
or
what
men
thought
of
him
he
had
unreasonable
fits
of
temper
he
became
distrustful
and
cynical
i
thought
then
sometimes
of
the
day
when
he
had
looked
at
troy
and
wanted
to
be
like
achilles
it
was
painful
to
me
to
hear
him
talking
as
eustace
used
to
talk
suspicious
intolerant
incredulous
i
thought
how
harry
had
once
hated
that
kind
of
talk
and
it
was
most
significant
of
the
change
that
had
come
over
the
good
companion
i
had
known
yet
sometimes
when
the
sun
shone
and
once
when
we
rode
back
into
albert
and
dined
quietly
alone
that
mask
of
bitterness
fell
away
there
were
flashes
of
the
old
cheerful
harry
and
i
had
hopes
i
hoped
philpott
would
be
killed
iv
but
he
survived
for
he
was
very
careful
and
though
as
i
have
said
he
stuck
it
for
a
long
time
he
was
by
no
means
the
gallant
you
would
have
imagined
from
his
treatment
of
defaulters
once
round
the
line
just
before
dawn
was
enough
for
him
in
that
sort
of
country
are
quiet
then
and
you
can
see
what
going
on
he
liked
it
best
when
were
quiet
so
did
all
of
us
and
i
do
blame
him
for
that
but
that
winter
there
was
a
thick
crop
of
is
the
short
title
for
a
man
who
has
been
evacuated
with
wounds
shot
himself
in
the
foot
or
held
a
finger
over
the
muzzle
of
his
rifle
or
dropped
a
great
boulder
on
his
foot
done
himself
any
reckless
injury
to
escape
from
the
misery
of
it
all
it
was
always
a
marvel
to
me
that
any
man
who
could
find
courage
to
do
such
things
could
not
find
courage
to
go
on
i
suppose
they
felt
it
would
bring
them
the
certainty
of
a
little
respite
and
beyond
that
they
did
not
care
for
it
was
the
uncertainty
of
their
life
that
had
broken
them
you
could
not
help
being
sorry
for
these
men
even
though
you
despised
them
it
made
you
sick
to
think
that
any
man
who
had
come
voluntarily
to
fight
for
his
country
could
be
brought
so
low
that
humanity
could
be
so
degraded
exactly
where
it
was
being
so
ennobled
but
philpott
had
no
such
qualms
he
was
ruthless
and
necessarily
so
but
beyond
that
he
was
brutal
he
bullied
when
they
came
before
him
healed
of
their
wounds
haggard
miserable
wisps
of
men
he
kept
them
standing
there
while
he
told
them
at
length
exactly
how
low
they
had
sunk
they
knew
that
well
enough
poor
devils
and
flung
at
them
a
rich
vocabulary
of
abuse
words
of
cowardice
and
dishonour
which
were
strictly
accurate
but
highly
unnecessary
for
these
men
were
going
back
to
duty
now
they
had
done
their
punishment
though
the
worst
of
it
was
still
to
come
all
they
needed
was
a
few
quiet
words
of
encouragement
from
a
strong
man
to
a
weaker
a
little
human
sympathy
and
that
appeal
to
a
man
honour
which
so
seldom
fails
if
it
is
rightly
made
well
this
did
not
surprise
me
in
philpott
he
had
no
surprises
for
me
by
now
what
did
surprise
me
was
harry
intolerant
even
cruel
comments
on
the
cases
of
the
he
had
always
had
a
real
sympathy
with
the
men
he
knew
the
strange
workings
of
their
minds
and
all
the
wretchedness
of
their
lives
he
understood
them
and
yet
here
he
was
as
scornful
as
prussian
on
the
subject
of
as
even
philpott
it
was
long
before
i
understood
this
i
do
know
that
i
ever
did
but
i
thought
it
was
this
that
in
these
wrecks
of
men
he
recognized
something
of
his
own
sufferings
and
recognizing
the
disease
he
was
the
more
appalled
by
the
remedy
they
took
the
kind
of
thing
that
had
led
them
to
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
he
had
been
through
was
going
through
there
the
connection
ceased
there
was
no
such
way
out
for
him
but
though
it
ceased
the
connection
was
so
close
that
it
was
degrading
and
this
scorn
and
anger
was
a
kind
of
instinctive
put
on
to
assure
himself
to
assure
the
world
that
there
was
no
connection
none
at
all
but
i
do
know
v
at
the
end
of
february
i
was
wounded
and
went
home
without
any
conceit
without
exaggerating
our
friendship
i
may
say
that
this
was
the
final
blow
for
harry
i
was
the
last
of
the
old
crowd
i
was
the
one
man
who
knew
the
truth
of
things
as
between
him
and
philpott
and
i
went
i
was
hit
by
a
big
shell
at
corner
and
harry
saw
me
on
the
stretcher
as
we
came
past
d
company
on
the
bapaume
road
he
walked
with
me
as
far
as
the
cookers
and
was
full
of
concern
for
my
wound
which
was
pretty
painful
just
then
but
he
bucked
me
up
and
talked
gaily
of
the
good
things
i
was
going
to
and
he
said
nothing
of
himself
but
when
he
left
me
there
was
a
look
about
him
what
is
the
word
it
is
the
only
one
like
a
dog
left
behind
while
i
was
still
in
hospital
i
had
two
letters
from
the
battalion
the
first
was
from
harry
a
long
wail
about
philpott
and
the
dullness
of
everybody
now
that
the
old
crowd
were
extinct
though
he
seemed
to
have
made
good
friends
of
some
of
the
dull
ones
at
the
end
of
that
endless
winter
when
it
seemed
as
if
the
spring
would
never
come
they
had
pulled
out
of
the
line
and
up
north
so
that
there
had
been
little
fighting
they
were
now
in
across
the
high
ridge
in
front
of
arras
preparing
for
an
advance
the
other
letter
was
from
old
knight
the
quartermaster
dated
two
months
after
i
left
i
will
give
you
an
extract
by
now
you
will
have
seen
or
heard
from
young
penrose
he
was
hit
on
the
a
nasty
wound
in
the
chest
from
a
splinter
it
was
rather
funny
not
funny
but
you
know
what
i
mean
how
he
got
it
i
was
there
myself
though
i
did
see
it
i
had
been
up
to
to
see
about
the
rations
and
there
were
a
lot
of
us
johnson
he
is
now
adj
in
your
place
and
fellowes
and
so
on
standing
outside
which
is
on
a
hill
what
you
people
call
a
forward
slope
i
believe
and
watching
our
guns
bombarding
the
village
it
was
a
remarkable
sight
etc
a
long
digression
the
boche
started
shelling
our
hill
he
dropped
them
in
pairs
first
of
all
at
the
other
end
of
the
hill
about
yards
off
and
then
nearer
and
nearer
about
yards
at
a
time
the
line
they
were
on
was
pretty
near
to
us
so
we
thought
the
would
be
a
good
place
to
go
to
penrose
was
just
starting
to
go
back
to
his
company
when
this
began
and
as
we
went
down
somebody
told
him
he
better
wait
a
bit
but
he
said
no
he
wanted
to
get
back
i
was
the
last
down
and
as
i
disappeared
pretty
hurriedly
i
told
him
not
to
be
a
fool
but
all
he
said
was
this
is
nothing
old
bird
you
wait
till
you
live
up
here
i
going
on
the
next
thing
we
heard
was
the
hell
of
an
explosion
on
top
we
ran
up
afterwards
and
there
he
was
about
thirty
yards
off
the
funny
thing
is
that
i
understood
he
rather
had
the
just
now
and
was
anything
but
reckless
in
fact
some
one
said
he
had
the
disease
otherwise
you
have
said
he
wanted
to
be
killed
i
do
know
why
he
was
asking
for
it
like
that
well
thank
god
i
a
etc
etc
i
read
it
all
very
carefully
and
wondered
have
said
he
wanted
to
be
i
wondered
about
that
very
much
and
there
was
a
postscript
which
interested
me
the
way
i
hear
burnett
got
the
for
salvage
i
believe
x
i
was
six
months
in
that
hospital
and
i
did
not
see
harry
for
seven
for
i
was
at
blackpool
and
he
at
lady
radmore
in
kensington
his
was
a
quicker
business
than
mine
and
when
i
had
finished
with
the
hospitals
and
the
homes
and
came
to
london
for
a
three
weeks
laze
he
was
back
at
the
depot
then
he
got
seven
days
leave
for
some
mysterious
reason
i
think
there
was
a
draft
leaving
shortly
and
everybody
had
some
leave
and
i
dined
twice
with
him
at
home
they
had
a
little
house
in
chelsea
very
tastefully
furnished
by
penrose
whom
i
now
saw
for
the
first
time
but
i
saw
more
of
her
that
evening
than
i
did
of
harry
who
was
hopelessly
entangled
with
two
or
three
she
was
a
dark
gentle
little
person
with
brown
and
rather
sorrowful
eyes
when
i
first
saw
her
i
thought
was
never
meant
to
be
a
soldier
wife
but
after
we
had
talked
a
little
i
added
she
is
a
good
one
she
was
clearly
very
much
in
love
with
harry
and
delighted
to
meet
some
one
who
had
been
with
him
in
france
and
was
fond
of
him
for
like
all
wives
she
soon
discovered
that
but
all
the
time
i
felt
that
there
were
questions
she
wanted
to
ask
me
and
could
not
i
will
not
pretend
to
tell
you
how
she
was
dressed
because
i
do
know
i
seldom
notice
and
then
i
never
remember
but
she
appealed
to
me
very
much
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
look
after
interests
if
i
ever
had
the
chance
if
there
was
ever
a
question
between
harry
and
a
single
man
i
had
no
chance
of
a
talk
with
harry
and
noticed
only
that
he
seemed
pretty
fit
again
but
the
second
night
i
went
there
was
the
last
night
of
harry
leave
if
i
had
known
that
when
i
was
asked
i
think
i
should
not
have
gone
for
while
it
showed
i
was
a
privileged
person
it
is
a
painful
privilege
to
break
in
on
the
evening
of
husband
and
wife
i
know
those
last
evenings
and
though
harry
was
only
going
back
to
the
depot
in
the
morning
it
was
known
there
had
been
heavy
losses
in
the
regiment
there
was
talk
of
a
draft
it
might
well
be
the
last
evening
of
all
i
got
there
early
at
harry
request
about
five
on
a
miserable
gusty
evening
in
early
november
harry
was
sitting
in
a
kind
of
study
library
or
den
writing
he
looked
less
well
and
very
sleepless
about
the
eyes
it
was
the
anniversary
of
one
of
the
great
battles
of
the
regiment
and
we
talked
a
little
of
that
day
as
soldiers
will
with
a
sort
of
gloomy
satisfaction
then
harry
said
slowly
been
offered
a
job
at
the
war
office
by
major
mackenzie
intelligence
i
said
very
good
but
i
was
thinking
more
of
harry
than
harry
harry
went
on
as
if
he
had
not
heard
was
writing
to
him
when
you
came
in
and
i
do
know
what
to
say
not
he
said
know
as
well
as
any
one
what
sort
of
time
had
and
how
i
been
treated
by
philpott
and
others
and
i
had
about
enough
of
it
i
remember
telling
you
once
on
the
peninsula
that
i
thought
myself
fairly
brave
when
i
first
went
out
and
my
god
so
i
was
compared
with
what
i
am
now
i
suppose
every
one
has
his
and
i
certainly
had
mine
i
simply
feel
i
face
it
again
well
i
said
the
job
and
have
done
with
it
you
done
as
much
as
you
can
and
you
ca
do
more
what
the
trouble
but
he
went
on
seemingly
to
convince
himself
rather
than
me
never
got
over
those
awful
in
that
valley
i
had
two
or
three
burst
right
on
top
of
me
you
know
the
lord
knows
how
i
escaped
and
now
i
simply
dream
of
them
i
dream
of
them
every
night
usually
it
an
enormous
endless
plain
full
of
of
course
and
raining
like
hell
and
i
walk
for
miles
usually
with
you
looking
over
my
shoulder
waiting
for
the
shells
to
come
and
then
i
hear
that
savage
kind
of
shriek
and
i
run
like
hell
only
i
ca
run
of
course
that
the
worst
part
and
i
get
into
a
ditch
and
lie
there
and
then
one
comes
that
i
know
by
the
sound
is
going
to
burst
on
top
of
me
and
i
wake
up
simply
sweating
with
funk
i
never
told
anybody
but
you
about
this
not
even
peggy
but
she
says
i
wake
her
up
sometimes
making
an
awful
noise
he
was
silent
for
a
little
and
i
had
nothing
to
say
then
it
all
so
different
now
so
damnably
dull
i
mind
if
we
could
all
go
out
together
again
just
the
old
crowd
so
that
we
could
have
good
evenings
and
not
care
what
happened
but
now
there
nobody
left
i
do
expect
they
let
go
out
again
only
poor
old
egerton
he
back
again
and
i
ca
stand
all
those
officers
and
people
like
philpott
and
all
the
old
duds
you
ca
get
away
from
it
the
officers
and
nothing
will
make
them
so
even
the
men
ca
stand
them
and
they
get
on
my
nerves
all
gets
on
my
nerves
the
mud
and
the
cold
and
the
futile
brigadiers
and
all
the
damned
eyewash
we
have
nowadays
never
having
a
decent
wash
and
being
cramped
up
in
a
the
size
of
a
with
four
where
you
ca
move
without
upsetting
the
candle
and
the
food
or
banging
your
head
and
getting
lousy
and
all
those
endless
ridiculous
details
you
have
to
look
after
day
after
day
haversack
rations
has
every
man
got
his
why
have
you
cleaned
your
rifle
as
if
i
cared
a
damn
no
i
wo
say
that
but
there
you
are
you
see
it
on
my
nerves
but
sometimes
and
though
i
sympathized
i
was
glad
there
was
a
i
think
of
some
of
the
bogus
people
who
been
out
perhaps
once
and
come
home
after
three
months
with
a
nice
blighty
in
the
shoulder
and
got
a
job
and
stayed
in
it
ever
since
i
feel
i
ca
do
that
either
and
run
the
risk
of
being
taken
for
one
of
them
do
think
there
any
danger
of
that
i
remarked
do
know
one
officeer
is
the
same
as
another
to
most
people
and
then
you
know
although
you
hate
it
it
does
get
hold
of
you
somehow
out
there
and
after
a
bit
when
you
got
used
to
being
at
home
you
get
restless
i
know
i
did
last
time
and
sometimes
i
do
now
i
do
say
i
hunger
for
the
battle
i
never
want
to
be
in
a
stunt
again
but
you
feel
kind
of
out
of
it
when
you
read
the
papers
or
meet
somebody
on
leave
you
think
of
the
amusing
evenings
we
used
to
have
and
i
rather
enjoyed
trekking
about
in
the
back
areas
especially
when
i
had
a
horse
wandering
along
on
a
good
frosty
day
and
never
sure
what
village
you
were
going
to
sleep
in
marching
through
doullens
with
the
band
estaminets
and
talking
french
and
all
the
rest
of
it
then
i
think
of
a
and
i
know
i
done
for
i
got
too
much
imagination
that
the
trouble
i
hope
you
not
fed
up
with
all
this
but
i
want
your
advice
it
funny
one
never
used
to
think
about
getting
killed
even
in
the
war
it
seemed
impossible
somehow
that
could
be
killed
did
you
ever
have
that
feeling
though
one
was
ready
enough
in
those
days
but
now
even
in
the
train
the
other
day
going
down
to
bristol
by
the
express
i
found
i
was
imagining
what
would
happen
if
there
was
a
smash
things
one
reads
of
you
know
carriages
catching
fire
and
so
on
just
and
the
question
is
is
it
any
going
out
if
you
got
into
that
state
and
if
one
says
no
is
one
just
making
it
an
excuse
it
no
good
telling
a
military
doctor
all
this
just
say
haw
what
you
want
is
some
fresh
air
and
exercise
my
son
and
for
all
i
know
they
may
be
right
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
think
i
physically
fit
really
my
own
doctor
says
not
but
you
never
examined
properly
before
you
go
out
as
you
know
you
all
troop
in
by
the
dozen
at
the
last
moment
and
the
fellow
says
feeling
quite
fit
and
if
you
just
had
a
good
breakfast
and
feel
buckish
you
say
yes
thank
you
and
there
you
are
unless
you
them
to
examine
you
you
might
have
galloping
consumption
for
all
they
know
and
i
damned
if
i
ask
them
after
all
i
suppose
the
system
right
if
a
man
can
stick
it
for
a
month
or
two
in
the
line
he
worth
sending
there
if
he
an
officer
and
it
does
matter
to
the
country
if
he
dies
of
consumption
afterwards
but
my
trouble
is
i
stick
it
for
a
month
or
two
or
shall
i
go
and
do
some
awful
thing
and
let
a
lot
of
fellows
down
putting
aside
my
own
inclinations
which
are
probably
pretty
selfish
what
is
it
my
duty
to
do
after
friend
philpott
i
do
know
that
i
so
keen
on
duty
as
i
was
but
i
do
want
to
stick
this
war
out
on
the
right
line
if
i
can
what
do
think
i
answer
that
i
said
one
consideration
you
seem
to
have
overlooked
and
that
is
penrose
after
all
you
a
married
man
and
that
makes
a
difference
does
it
does
it
i
do
really
see
why
it
make
any
difference
about
going
out
or
not
going
out
otherwise
every
shirker
could
run
off
and
marry
a
wife
and
live
happily
ever
after
but
it
certainly
makes
it
a
damned
sight
harder
to
decide
and
it
makes
the
hell
of
a
difference
when
you
out
there
you
can
make
up
your
mind
not
to
think
of
it
when
you
at
home
like
this
but
out
there
when
you
cold
and
fed
up
and
just
starting
up
the
line
with
a
you
ca
help
thinking
of
it
and
it
makes
things
about
ten
times
more
difficult
and
as
you
know
it
jolly
hard
not
to
let
it
make
a
difference
to
what
you
do
but
damn
it
why
did
you
remind
me
of
that
i
did
want
to
think
about
it
and
then
penrose
came
in
and
we
went
down
to
dinner
ii
i
did
not
enjoy
that
dinner
to
begin
with
i
felt
like
a
vulgar
intruder
on
something
that
was
almost
sacred
and
certainly
very
precious
for
all
the
signs
of
the
evening
were
there
the
dishes
we
had
were
harry
favourites
procured
at
i
know
what
trouble
and
expense
by
harry
and
she
watched
tremulously
to
see
that
he
liked
them
she
had
gone
out
and
bought
him
a
bottle
of
moselle
for
a
special
surprise
and
some
port
which
was
a
huge
extravagance
but
that
was
nothing
if
these
things
could
only
give
a
special
something
to
this
meal
which
would
make
him
remember
it
for
the
flowers
he
never
saw
and
the
new
dress
went
unnoticed
for
a
long
time
but
i
felt
that
it
would
all
have
gone
much
better
perhaps
if
i
had
not
been
there
and
i
hoped
she
did
not
hate
me
and
harry
was
not
at
his
best
the
question
he
asked
me
i
had
had
no
time
to
answer
and
he
had
not
answered
it
himself
through
most
of
that
dinner
which
by
all
the
rules
should
have
been
superficially
at
least
cheerful
and
careless
as
if
there
were
no
such
thing
as
separation
ahead
harry
was
thoughtful
and
preoccupied
and
i
knew
that
he
was
still
arguing
with
himself
shall
i
say
to
mackenzie
yes
or
no
wandering
up
and
down
among
the
old
doubts
and
resolutions
and
fears
harry
saw
this
as
well
as
i
and
no
doubt
she
cursed
me
for
being
there
because
in
my
presence
she
could
not
ask
him
what
worried
him
but
the
moselle
began
to
do
its
work
harry
talked
a
little
and
noticed
the
new
dress
and
we
all
laughed
a
lot
at
the
pudding
which
came
up
in
such
a
curious
shape
we
were
very
glad
to
laugh
at
something
then
harry
spoke
of
some
people
in
the
regiment
of
whom
she
had
heard
a
good
deal
george
dawson
and
egerton
and
old
colonel
roberts
i
knew
that
in
a
minute
we
should
stumble
into
talking
about
the
trenches
or
shells
or
some
such
folly
and
have
harry
gloomy
and
brooding
again
i
could
not
stand
that
and
i
did
not
think
harry
could
so
i
plunged
recklessly
into
the
smoother
waters
of
life
in
france
i
told
them
the
old
story
about
general
jackson
and
the
and
then
we
came
on
to
the
famous
night
at
forceville
and
other
historic
battalion
orgies
the
dinner
at
monchy
breton
when
we
put
a
row
of
candles
on
the
floor
of
the
tent
for
footlights
and
george
and
a
few
subs
made
a
perfect
beauty
chorus
those
are
the
things
one
likes
to
remember
about
active
service
and
i
was
very
glad
to
remember
them
then
the
special
port
came
in
and
was
a
great
success
harry
warmed
up
and
laughed
over
those
old
gaieties
and
was
in
great
form
at
that
moment
i
think
his
answer
to
major
mackenzie
would
have
been
definitely
harry
laughed
very
much
too
and
said
she
envied
us
the
amusing
times
we
had
together
there
men
have
all
the
fun
and
that
made
me
feel
a
heartless
ass
for
having
started
on
that
topic
for
i
knew
that
when
harry
was
away
there
was
little
for
her
and
whether
he
was
lying
on
his
stomach
in
a
or
singing
songs
in
an
estaminet
not
thinking
much
of
his
wife
perhaps
except
when
they
drank
and
wives
it
was
all
one
uniform
hideous
wait
for
her
so
i
think
it
was
hollow
laughter
for
p
moreover
though
i
did
not
know
how
much
she
knew
about
difficulties
the
and
so
one
i
felt
sure
that
with
the
extraordinary
instinct
of
a
wife
she
scented
something
of
the
conflict
that
was
going
on
and
she
knew
vaguely
that
this
exaggerated
laudation
of
the
amenities
of
france
meant
somehow
danger
to
her
so
that
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
bucking
up
of
harry
i
tardily
perceived
that
between
us
we
were
wounding
the
wife
and
i
more
than
ever
wished
myself
anywhere
than
sitting
at
that
pretty
table
with
the
shaded
lights
well
we
nearly
finished
the
port
harry
still
in
excellent
form
and
went
upstairs
harry
went
off
to
look
for
smokes
or
something
and
i
knew
at
once
that
harry
was
going
to
ask
me
questions
about
him
you
know
how
a
woman
stands
in
front
of
the
fire
and
looks
down
and
kind
of
paws
the
fender
with
one
foot
when
she
is
going
to
say
something
confidential
then
she
looks
up
suddenly
and
you
done
harry
did
that
and
i
was
done
at
any
other
time
i
should
have
loved
to
talk
to
her
about
harry
but
that
night
i
felt
it
was
dangerous
ground
do
you
think
harry
is
looking
she
said
probably
know
better
than
i
do
nowadays
i
said
i
thought
he
seemed
pretty
fit
considering
all
things
you
think
he
have
to
go
out
again
she
asked
do
think
he
ought
to
but
they
seem
so
short
of
men
still
he
not
really
strong
you
know
so
she
knew
nothing
about
the
and
this
put
me
in
a
hole
for
if
i
told
her
about
it
and
he
did
not
take
it
but
went
out
again
the
knowledge
would
be
a
standing
torture
to
her
on
the
other
hand
i
him
to
take
it
i
thought
he
ought
to
and
if
she
knew
about
it
she
might
be
able
to
make
him
wives
can
do
a
great
deal
in
that
way
but
that
would
be
disloyal
to
harry
well
i
temporized
with
vague
answers
while
i
wrestled
with
this
problem
and
she
told
me
more
about
harry
know
he
has
the
most
dreams
wakes
up
screaming
at
night
and
quite
frightens
me
and
i
do
think
they
ought
to
be
to
go
out
again
when
they
like
that
i
do
him
to
go
out
again
at
least
she
added
as
a
kind
of
concession
to
convention
it
his
duty
of
course
then
defiantly
i
want
him
to
go
anyhow
i
think
he
done
his
bit
has
he
mr
benson
has
indeed
i
said
with
sincerity
at
last
you
have
some
influence
with
him
ca
you
but
then
harry
came
in
and
i
had
lost
my
chance
i
have
noticed
that
while
on
the
stage
conversations
which
must
necessarily
be
private
are
invariably
concluded
without
interruption
in
private
life
and
especially
private
houses
are
always
interrupted
long
before
the
end
harry
went
to
the
piano
and
harry
and
i
sat
down
to
smoke
and
since
it
was
the
last
night
harry
was
allowed
to
smoke
his
pipe
the
way
harry
said
that
nearly
made
me
weep
so
i
sat
there
and
watched
harry
and
his
wife
played
and
played
soft
melancholy
homesick
things
chopin
i
think
that
leagued
with
the
wine
and
the
warm
fire
and
the
deep
chairs
in
an
exquisite
conspiracy
of
repose
she
played
for
a
long
time
but
i
saw
that
she
too
was
watching
and
the
fancy
came
to
me
that
she
was
fighting
for
harry
fighting
perhaps
unconsciously
that
vague
danger
she
had
seen
at
dinner
when
it
had
beaten
her
fighting
it
with
this
music
that
made
war
seem
so
distant
and
home
so
lovable
and
soon
i
began
to
see
that
she
was
winning
for
when
she
began
playing
harry
had
sat
down
a
little
restless
again
and
fidgeted
as
if
the
music
reminded
him
of
good
things
too
much
and
his
eyes
wandered
round
the
room
and
took
in
all
the
familiar
things
like
a
man
saying
the
old
chair
with
the
new
chintz
and
the
yellow
curtains
and
the
bookcase
his
father
left
him
and
the
little
bookcase
where
his
history
books
were
he
looked
a
long
time
at
them
and
the
firelight
shining
on
the
piano
and
his
wife
playing
and
playing
and
when
he
had
looked
at
her
quickly
he
sat
up
and
poked
the
fire
fiercely
and
sat
back
frowning
he
was
wondering
again
this
music
was
being
too
much
for
him
then
she
stopped
and
looked
across
at
harry
and
smiled
when
she
played
again
it
was
i
think
a
nocturne
of
chopin
god
knows
which
but
it
was
very
peaceful
and
homesick
and
as
i
watched
i
made
sure
that
she
had
won
for
there
came
over
harry
a
wonderful
repose
he
no
longer
frowned
or
fidgeted
or
raised
his
eyebrows
in
the
nervous
way
he
had
but
lay
back
in
a
kind
of
abandonment
of
content
and
i
said
to
myself
has
decided
he
will
say
yes
to
mackenzie
harry
perhaps
also
perceived
it
for
after
a
little
she
stopped
and
came
over
to
us
and
then
i
did
a
fateful
thing
there
was
a
copy
of
lying
by
my
chair
and
because
of
the
silence
that
was
on
us
i
picked
it
up
and
looked
aimlessly
at
it
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
the
casualty
list
buried
in
small
type
among
some
vast
advertisements
of
patent
foods
i
glanced
down
the
list
in
that
casual
manner
which
came
to
us
when
we
knew
that
all
our
best
friends
were
already
dead
or
disposed
of
then
my
eye
caught
the
name
of
the
regiment
and
the
name
of
a
man
i
knew
captain
egerton
killed
there
was
another
near
it
and
another
and
many
more
the
list
was
thick
with
them
and
the
other
battalions
in
the
brigade
had
many
names
there
fellows
one
had
relieved
in
the
line
or
seen
in
billets
or
talked
with
in
the
cocktail
café
at
there
must
have
been
a
massacre
in
the
brigade
ten
officers
killed
and
ten
wounded
in
our
lot
alone
i
suppose
i
made
that
vague
murmur
of
rage
and
regret
which
slips
out
of
you
when
you
read
these
things
for
harry
looked
up
and
asked
that
i
gave
him
the
paper
and
he
too
looked
down
that
list
only
two
of
those
names
were
names
of
the
old
crowd
and
many
of
them
were
the
dull
men
but
we
knew
them
very
well
for
all
that
and
we
knew
they
were
good
men
egerton
gordon
young
matthews
spenser
smith
the
bombing
fellow
tompkinson
all
gone
so
we
were
silent
for
a
long
minute
remembering
those
men
and
harry
stared
into
the
fire
i
wondered
what
she
was
thinking
of
and
i
was
sorry
for
her
for
when
harry
got
up
there
was
a
look
about
him
which
i
had
seen
before
though
not
for
many
months
not
since
the
first
days
on
the
somme
while
i
was
groping
after
my
coat
in
the
hall
harry
came
out
of
his
den
with
a
letter
which
he
asked
me
to
in
the
box
i
looked
at
it
without
shame
it
was
addressed
to
major
mackenzie
etc
what
have
you
said
i
asked
said
harry
with
a
kind
of
challenging
look
i
think
you
wrong
i
told
him
though
i
knew
then
that
i
was
too
late
harry
was
beaten
now
finally
beaten
poor
thing
what
are
you
two
talking
about
said
harry
a
dinner
my
dear
i
went
out
and
posted
that
accursed
letter
thanking
god
that
i
was
not
a
wife
xi
harry
went
to
france
again
a
month
later
after
the
futile
kind
of
medical
examination
he
had
foretold
i
had
a
letter
from
him
from
the
base
and
after
that
there
was
silence
i
even
began
to
hunt
about
in
the
casualty
lists
but
he
was
never
there
and
seven
weeks
later
they
let
me
go
out
again
myself
to
the
astonishment
of
all
but
the
military
doctors
at
the
base
i
heard
of
harry
some
one
had
been
wanted
for
some
kind
of
job
down
there
an
officer
to
instruct
the
details
in
the
mysteries
of
iron
rations
or
something
of
the
sort
harry
happening
to
be
there
at
the
time
and
pleasing
the
eye
of
the
aldermanic
officer
in
command
of
our
base
depot
had
been
graciously
appointed
to
the
post
but
he
had
caused
a
considerable
flutter
in
the
tents
of
the
mighty
by
flatly
declining
it
and
stating
insanely
that
he
preferred
to
go
up
to
the
line
this
being
still
the
one
topic
of
conversation
in
the
camp
i
did
not
linger
there
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
infantry
base
depots
are
bad
places
and
that
one
was
very
bad
you
had
worse
food
worse
treatment
and
worse
company
than
you
ever
had
in
the
line
much
discomfort
and
no
dignity
i
never
understood
why
officers
should
be
treated
with
such
contempt
whenever
there
were
a
number
of
them
together
if
you
went
about
by
yourself
or
with
another
officer
or
two
you
had
a
certain
amount
of
politeness
and
consideration
from
military
officials
but
as
soon
as
you
got
with
a
of
officers
you
were
doomed
you
were
dirt
if
the
intention
at
the
base
was
to
make
the
line
seem
a
haven
of
refuge
and
civility
it
was
highly
successful
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
got
back
to
the
battalion
under
the
usual
conditions
a
long
jog
in
the
under
the
interminable
dripping
poplars
with
a
vile
wind
lashing
the
usual
rain
over
the
usual
flat
fields
where
the
old
women
laboured
and
stooped
as
usual
and
took
no
notice
of
anything
the
heart
sinks
a
little
as
you
look
at
the
shivering
dreariness
of
it
all
and
if
it
is
near
the
line
you
hope
secretly
that
the
battalion
is
for
at
least
a
few
days
more
that
you
may
have
just
two
days
to
get
used
to
this
beastliness
again
and
not
be
met
by
some
cheery
acclimatized
ass
with
a
to
see
you
old
son
just
in
time
going
up
doing
a
stunt
on
tuesday
yet
as
you
come
to
the
village
there
is
a
strange
sense
of
that
comes
with
the
recognition
of
familiar
things
limbers
clattering
and
splashing
along
and
the
regimental
postman
trudging
back
with
the
mail
and
c
company
cooker
steaming
pleasantly
under
an
outhouse
and
odd
men
with
waterproof
sheets
draped
over
the
shoulders
wet
and
glistening
i
was
lucky
for
the
battalion
was
a
long
way
back
resting
so
that
this
sense
was
strong
upon
me
and
i
wanted
to
see
harry
when
i
came
near
to
the
usual
main
street
i
saw
the
battalion
marching
in
by
a
side
road
coming
back
from
a
route
march
i
sent
my
gear
ahead
and
got
down
to
see
them
pass
it
was
strangely
pleasant
the
drums
of
the
little
band
were
covered
because
of
the
wet
and
only
the
bugles
brayed
harshly
but
very
cheerfully
old
philpott
was
ahead
of
them
riding
fatly
on
his
mild
black
mare
and
returned
my
salute
quite
pleasantly
you
could
see
a
lot
of
young
recruits
among
the
men
and
there
were
many
officers
i
had
never
seen
but
the
welcoming
grins
of
the
old
men
we
had
had
from
the
beginning
mostly
now
made
up
for
that
young
smith
i
saw
in
command
of
c
company
now
and
tarrant
our
late
transport
officer
was
squelching
at
the
head
of
a
platoon
obviously
not
liking
it
much
then
came
d
company
and
i
looked
eagerly
for
harry
stephenson
i
knew
in
command
how
young
the
company
commanders
were
but
there
were
only
two
other
officers
and
they
both
strange
the
last
of
them
tramped
past
and
i
was
left
silent
in
the
rain
foolishly
disturbed
where
was
harry
ass
no
doubt
he
is
orderly
officer
or
away
on
a
course
but
i
disturbed
and
the
thought
came
to
me
that
if
anything
had
happened
to
him
i
too
should
be
lonely
here
with
none
of
the
old
crowd
left
i
walked
on
then
and
came
to
the
little
flag
of
d
company
headquarters
flapping
damply
outside
an
estaminet
in
the
mess
they
greeted
me
very
kindly
and
gave
me
tea
but
there
was
still
no
harry
but
they
all
talked
very
fast
and
the
tea
was
good
where
penrose
i
asked
at
last
have
seen
him
yet
i
had
spoken
to
stephenson
he
did
not
answer
immediately
but
he
picked
up
his
cup
and
drank
assiduously
then
he
kind
of
mumbled
very
low
and
apologetic
in
his
billet
under
close
arrest
arrest
my
god
what
for
stephenson
began
to
drink
again
he
was
a
good
fellow
who
knew
that
harry
and
i
were
friends
also
he
had
known
harry
in
the
souchez
days
and
he
did
not
like
having
to
tell
me
this
but
one
of
his
young
subalterns
a
young
pup
just
out
was
less
sensitive
and
told
me
brutally
away
cowardice
in
the
face
of
have
some
more
tea
ii
bit
by
bit
i
heard
the
whole
miserable
story
or
rather
that
naked
kernel
of
it
which
passed
publicly
for
the
whole
story
i
had
to
make
my
own
footnotes
my
own
queries
the
first
night
harry
was
with
the
battalion
philpott
had
sent
him
up
with
a
to
the
front
line
or
thereabouts
fifty
men
and
some
engineering
stuff
of
sorts
wiring
trestles
barbed
wire
or
something
it
was
country
no
communication
trenches
or
anything
and
since
there
had
been
an
attack
recently
the
boche
artillery
was
very
active
on
the
roads
and
back
areas
also
there
was
the
usual
rotten
valley
to
cross
with
the
hell
of
a
barrage
in
it
so
much
these
young
braves
conceded
harry
had
started
off
with
his
party
had
called
at
the
brigade
dump
and
picked
up
the
stuff
later
on
some
one
rang
up
brigade
from
the
line
and
said
no
party
had
arrived
brigade
rang
up
philpott
and
he
sent
up
the
assistant
adjutant
to
investigate
somewhere
in
the
arras
road
he
had
come
upon
harry
with
most
of
the
party
down
the
road
towards
the
dump
away
from
the
the
stores
were
urgently
needed
at
the
front
they
never
got
there
that
was
all
the
was
well
it
was
a
black
story
but
i
made
one
or
two
footnotes
at
once
very
first
night
he
was
the
awful
luck
the
cruelty
of
it
just
back
in
the
condition
of
nerves
i
knew
him
to
be
in
with
that
first
miserable
feeling
upon
him
wondering
probably
why
the
hell
he
had
driven
himself
out
there
and
praying
to
be
let
down
easy
for
one
night
at
least
and
then
to
be
sent
straight
up
on
a
job
like
that
the
job
that
had
broken
him
before
and
by
philpott
i
seemed
to
see
philpott
arranging
that
with
a
kind
of
savage
glee
here
master
penrose
again
well
he
better
take
that
party
instead
of
gibson
and
who
was
the
assistant
adjutant
god
knows
if
every
that
went
wrong
meant
a
there
would
be
no
officers
left
in
the
army
and
if
some
had
been
at
work
the
assistant
adjutant
i
asked
who
was
attached
to
division
used
to
be
in
this
battalion
in
your
time
i
believe
burnett
burnett
he
rang
up
the
colonel
and
told
him
about
it
i
groaned
the
gods
were
against
harry
indeed
burnett
had
been
away
from
the
battalion
for
eighteen
months
drifting
about
from
odd
job
to
odd
job
town
major
here
dump
officer
there
never
in
the
line
why
the
devil
had
he
come
back
now
to
put
his
foot
in
it
and
perhaps
but
i
could
not
believe
that
stephenson
two
young
officers
wallace
and
brown
made
no
footnote
naturally
they
had
come
out
by
the
same
draft
as
harry
one
from
sandhurst
the
other
from
a
cadet
school
they
were
fresh
as
harry
had
been
and
they
had
no
mercy
and
while
i
resented
their
tone
i
tried
to
remember
that
they
knew
not
harry
and
said
nothing
but
when
young
wallace
summed
up
the
subject
with
all
i
can
say
is
he
a
swine
and
deserves
all
he
gets
i
exploded
young
pup
i
said
out
and
hardly
seen
a
shot
fired
you
dare
to
say
anything
about
penrose
i
tell
you
you
not
fit
to
lick
his
boots
do
you
know
that
he
joined
up
in
the
ranks
in
august
and
went
through
gallipoli
and
had
done
two
years
active
service
before
you
even
had
a
uniform
do
you
know
he
just
refused
a
job
at
home
in
order
to
come
out
here
and
another
job
at
the
base
does
that
look
like
cold
feet
you
wait
till
you
been
out
a
year
my
son
before
you
talk
about
cold
feet
you
but
i
could
control
myself
any
further
i
went
out
cursing
iii
then
i
got
leave
to
go
and
see
harry
he
was
in
his
billet
in
a
small
bedroom
on
the
ground
floor
there
was
a
sentry
standing
at
the
window
fixed
bayonet
and
all
so
that
he
should
neither
escape
nor
make
away
with
himself
he
was
surprised
and
i
think
really
pleased
to
see
me
for
before
me
as
he
said
or
any
one
who
knew
his
history
he
was
not
ashamed
it
was
only
when
the
ignorant
the
wallaces
were
near
that
he
was
filled
with
humiliation
because
of
the
things
he
knew
they
were
thinking
sentry
out
there
he
told
me
in
my
platoon
at
gallipoli
one
of
my
old
men
just
before
you
came
in
he
tapped
on
the
window
and
wished
me
luck
he
said
that
all
the
old
lads
did
the
same
it
bucked
me
up
no
end
not
that
he
needed
much
up
for
he
was
strangely
quiet
and
resigned
more
nearly
at
peace
with
everything
than
i
had
seen
him
for
many
months
he
said
wish
to
god
that
i
was
a
single
man
and
i
wish
to
god
they
would
get
on
with
it
he
had
been
under
arrest
for
six
weeks
six
solid
weeks
carted
about
from
place
to
place
like
some
animal
waiting
for
slaughter
while
the
summaries
of
evidence
and
the
memos
and
the
secret
envelopes
went
backwards
and
forwards
through
and
through
from
mandarin
to
mandarin
from
to
while
generals
and
legal
advisers
and
judge
advocates
and
clerks
wrote
their
miserable
initials
on
the
dirty
forms
and
wondered
what
the
devil
they
should
decide
and
decided
nothing
at
all
all
this
terrible
time
harry
had
been
writing
to
his
wife
pretending
that
all
was
well
with
him
describing
route
marches
and
scenery
and
all
the
usual
stuff
about
weather
and
clothes
and
food
now
at
least
somebody
decided
and
harry
was
almost
happy
for
it
was
an
end
of
suspense
they
settled
on
a
he
said
knew
i
was
done
and
except
for
peggy
i
do
care
i
do
know
what
they
told
you
but
like
you
to
know
what
really
happened
i
found
the
battalion
at
monval
the
same
old
part
and
got
there
feeling
pretty
rotten
old
philpott
of
course
sent
me
off
with
a
like
a
shot
out
of
a
gun
before
i
been
there
an
hour
i
picked
up
some
wiring
stuff
at
the
brigade
dump
it
was
a
long
way
up
the
road
then
not
far
from
hellfire
corner
fritz
was
shelling
the
road
like
hell
going
up
and
down
dropping
them
in
pairs
fifty
yards
further
every
time
know
the
game
i
had
the
pretty
badly
and
so
had
the
men
poor
devils
but
what
was
worse
they
seemed
to
know
that
i
had
we
had
a
lot
of
shells
very
close
to
us
and
some
of
the
men
kept
rushing
towards
the
bank
when
they
heard
one
coming
well
you
do
get
on
very
fast
at
that
rate
and
it
damned
hard
to
keep
hold
of
them
when
they
like
that
and
knowing
they
were
like
that
made
me
even
worse
when
we
got
to
dead
mule
tree
about
ten
of
them
were
missing
just
stayed
under
the
bank
in
the
holes
i
do
say
this
to
excuse
myself
i
just
tell
you
what
happened
then
we
got
to
that
high
bit
where
the
bank
stops
and
the
valley
goes
up
on
the
left
you
know
the
awful
feeling
one
has
there
and
they
had
a
regular
barrage
just
at
the
corner
i
got
the
men
under
the
bank
and
waited
till
a
shell
burst
and
then
tried
to
dash
them
past
before
the
next
but
the
next
one
came
too
fast
and
fell
plunk
into
the
middle
of
the
column
behind
me
three
men
were
killed
outright
and
those
of
us
who
had
flung
themselves
down
were
knocked
over
i
fell
in
a
kind
of
narrow
ditch
by
the
road
when
i
put
my
head
up
and
looked
back
i
saw
some
of
the
men
vanishing
back
under
the
bank
then
another
one
came
i
should
think
they
were
and
i
grovelled
in
the
ditch
again
it
was
just
like
my
awful
dreams
i
must
have
been
there
about
ten
minutes
after
every
one
i
started
to
get
up
and
go
back
to
the
men
under
the
bank
meaning
to
get
them
together
again
every
time
the
next
one
came
too
quick
and
i
was
pinned
simply
pinned
in
that
ditch
then
fritz
stopped
for
a
minute
or
two
altering
the
programme
i
suppose
and
i
got
up
and
ran
like
hell
for
the
bank
the
four
or
five
men
lying
near
me
got
up
and
ran
too
we
got
under
the
bank
we
lay
down
and
i
looked
round
there
was
not
a
man
to
be
seen
i
shouted
but
at
first
nothing
happened
and
i
tell
you
i
was
glad
some
of
the
men
who
had
gone
back
not
seeing
me
anywhere
had
melted
away
home
i
do
blame
then
a
few
drifted
along
from
further
down
the
bank
by
degrees
most
of
the
party
turned
up
there
must
have
been
between
thirty
and
forty
of
them
in
the
end
then
you
see
i
knew
i
should
have
to
go
on
again
get
past
the
corner
somehow
and
i
could
i
simply
could
face
it
peters
the
said
something
about
going
to
have
another
shot
sir
he
was
pretty
shaken
himself
they
all
were
but
he
have
gone
we
to
have
gone
on
i
know
that
but
anyhow
i
told
him
i
think
we
should
ever
get
by
at
present
and
said
we
better
go
back
a
bit
and
wait
under
cover
some
yarn
or
other
so
we
started
back
down
the
road
the
boche
was
still
doing
the
up
and
down
game
on
the
road
only
about
twice
as
much
by
this
time
i
can
tell
you
there
was
no
shame
between
those
men
and
me
we
understood
each
other
every
time
we
heard
that
damned
shriek
we
fell
into
and
prayed
they
were
following
us
down
the
road
getting
nearer
and
nearer
you
know
that
in
the
bank
where
headquarters
used
to
be
well
just
when
it
looked
as
if
the
next
lot
must
come
right
on
top
of
us
i
saw
a
light
coming
from
the
and
most
of
us
ran
hell
for
leather
for
the
door
some
one
was
standing
at
the
entrance
as
we
dashed
in
just
in
time
we
nearly
knocked
him
over
and
guess
who
it
was
said
harry
with
a
horrible
kind
of
hysterical
laugh
who
it
was
it
was
burnett
burnett
of
all
people
he
had
been
sent
up
to
find
out
what
had
happened
well
he
asked
what
the
hell
i
was
doing
and
said
i
was
to
go
on
at
once
i
said
i
was
going
to
wait
a
bit
there
was
too
much
of
a
barrage
then
he
said
very
offensively
he
could
help
that
my
orders
were
to
go
on
at
once
that
annoyed
me
and
i
said
i
see
him
damned
first
and
told
him
if
it
was
so
urgent
he
could
take
the
party
up
himself
if
he
liked
but
he
did
naturally
no
reason
why
he
should
then
he
rang
up
philpott
and
told
him
that
he
had
seen
the
officer
in
charge
and
some
of
the
party
down
the
road
so
he
had
of
course
he
saw
me
running
for
the
though
the
joke
of
it
is
the
joke
of
it
is
was
sheltering
there
and
at
the
enormity
of
that
joke
harry
went
off
into
that
hideous
laughter
again
said
i
refused
to
obey
orders
and
asked
for
instructions
philpott
said
it
was
too
late
now
the
stuff
had
been
wanted
by
midnight
he
told
burnett
to
put
me
under
arrest
and
come
back
what
happened
he
went
on
i
do
care
only
i
wish
it
had
been
anybody
but
burnett
though
i
suppose
he
was
quite
right
but
it
makes
no
odds
i
got
the
and
i
failed
with
the
party
and
i
do
deny
it
even
if
i
was
really
running
when
he
saw
me
one
thing
i
say
if
i
did
have
the
never
had
cold
feet
till
that
night
i
glad
i
came
out
this
time
if
i
did
fail
at
the
pinch
burnett
would
have
i
knew
i
was
done
when
i
came
and
i
know
i
done
now
i
wish
you
just
explain
it
all
to
peggy
and
the
people
who
know
and
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
do
xii
the
was
held
in
an
old
farm
lying
just
outside
the
village
there
was
a
large
courtyard
where
the
chickens
clucked
all
day
and
children
and
cattle
roamed
unchecked
in
the
spacious
midden
the
was
unusually
suitable
to
its
purpose
being
panelled
all
round
in
some
dark
wood
with
great
black
beams
under
a
ceiling
high
and
vaulted
and
an
open
hearth
where
the
dry
wood
crackled
heartlessly
all
day
usually
these
trials
are
conducted
in
the
best
bedroom
of
some
estaminet
and
the
court
sits
defensively
with
a
vast
white
bed
at
their
backs
but
this
room
was
strangely
dignified
and
legal
only
at
first
madame
persisted
in
marching
through
it
with
saucepans
to
the
kitchen
all
these
curious
english
functions
were
the
same
to
her
a
christmas
dinner
or
a
or
the
trial
of
a
soldier
for
his
life
the
court
impressed
me
rather
favourably
a
and
four
others
the
who
was
president
of
the
court
was
a
square
person
with
a
good
moustache
and
rather
hard
blue
eyes
he
had
many
rows
of
ribbons
so
many
that
as
i
looked
at
them
from
a
dark
corner
at
the
back
they
seemed
like
some
regiment
of
coloured
beetles
paraded
in
close
column
of
companies
all
these
men
were
very
excellently
groomed
is
the
right
word
for
indeed
they
suggested
a
number
of
horses
all
their
skins
were
bright
and
shiny
and
well
kept
and
the
leather
of
their
sam
brownes
and
their
field
boots
and
jingling
spurs
and
all
their
harness
were
beautiful
and
glistening
in
the
firelight
i
once
went
over
the
royal
stables
at
madrid
and
when
all
these
glossy
creatures
jingled
heavily
up
to
their
table
i
was
reminded
of
that
they
sat
down
and
pawed
the
floor
restively
with
their
hoofs
cursing
in
their
hearts
because
they
had
been
brought
so
far
do
some
damned
but
all
their
faces
said
god
at
least
i
have
had
my
oats
and
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
greyness
about
them
the
hair
of
some
of
them
was
splashed
with
grey
the
faces
of
most
of
them
were
weathered
and
grey
and
one
felt
that
the
opinions
of
all
of
them
were
grey
but
not
weathered
for
they
were
just
men
according
to
their
views
they
would
do
the
thing
conscientiously
and
i
could
not
have
hoped
for
a
better
court
but
as
judges
they
held
the
fatal
military
heresy
that
the
forms
and
procedure
of
military
law
are
the
best
conceivable
machinery
for
the
discovery
of
truth
it
was
not
their
fault
they
had
lived
with
it
from
their
youth
and
since
it
is
really
a
form
of
conceit
the
heresy
had
this
extension
that
they
themselves
and
men
like
them
blunt
honest
straightforward
men
were
the
best
conceivable
ministers
for
the
discovery
of
truth
and
they
needed
no
assistance
any
of
them
would
have
told
you
it
sir
there
nothing
fairer
to
the
prisoner
than
a
field
general
and
if
you
read
the
books
or
witness
the
trial
of
a
soldier
for
some
simple
you
will
agree
but
given
a
complex
case
where
testimony
is
at
all
doubtful
where
there
are
and
hidden
animosities
the
honest
men
are
lost
to
begin
with
being
in
their
own
view
and
they
consider
the
prisoner
friend
to
be
superfluous
and
if
he
attempts
any
genuine
advocacy
they
can
not
stomach
the
sight
of
him
friend
be
damned
they
will
tell
you
prosecutor
does
all
that
and
anything
he
does
find
out
the
court
will
now
the
prosecutor
is
indeed
charged
with
the
duty
of
out
anything
in
the
favour
of
the
accused
that
is
to
say
if
private
smith
after
looting
his
neighbour
becomes
afterwards
remorseful
and
returns
his
loot
to
its
owner
the
prosecutor
will
ask
questions
to
establish
the
fact
in
a
case
like
harry
it
means
practically
nothing
the
prosecutor
will
not
a
shifty
or
suspicious
witness
dive
into
his
motives
get
at
the
secret
history
of
the
business
first
because
it
is
not
his
job
and
secondly
because
being
as
a
rule
only
the
adjutant
of
his
battalion
he
does
not
know
how
the
court
will
not
do
this
because
they
do
not
know
anything
about
the
secret
history
and
they
are
incapable
of
imagining
any
because
they
believe
implicitly
that
any
witness
officer
or
man
except
perhaps
the
accused
is
a
blunt
honest
straightforward
man
like
themselves
and
incapable
of
deception
or
concealment
this
is
the
job
of
the
prisoner
friend
now
book
lays
down
very
fairly
that
if
he
be
an
officer
or
otherwise
qualified
friend
shall
have
all
the
rights
of
defending
counsel
in
a
civil
court
in
practice
the
men
often
make
nothing
of
this
safeguard
many
courts
i
have
been
before
had
never
heard
of
the
provision
many
having
heard
of
it
refused
flatly
to
recognize
it
or
insisted
that
all
questions
should
be
put
when
they
do
recognize
the
right
they
are
immediately
prejudiced
against
the
prisoner
if
that
right
is
exercised
any
attempt
to
discredit
or
genuinely
a
witness
is
regarded
as
a
rather
sinister
piece
of
and
if
the
prisoner
friend
ventures
to
sum
up
the
evidence
in
the
favour
at
the
end
it
is
too
often
damned
usually
it
is
safer
for
a
prisoner
to
abandon
his
rights
altogether
in
that
respect
but
that
should
not
be
in
a
case
like
harry
the
question
of
counsel
was
vital
in
his
case
i
make
no
definite
charges
against
philpott
and
burnett
all
i
say
is
that
it
was
that
the
two
men
most
instrumental
in
bringing
harry
to
trial
should
have
been
the
only
two
men
with
whom
he
had
ever
had
any
bitterness
during
his
whole
military
career
it
was
specially
unfortunate
that
burnett
should
be
the
first
and
principal
accuser
when
you
remembered
that
almost
the
last
time
harry
had
seen
burnett
he
had
shown
courage
where
burnett
had
shown
cowardice
and
thus
humiliated
him
this
case
could
have
been
passed
over
hundreds
such
have
been
passed
over
and
on
their
merits
from
any
human
standpoint
rightly
why
was
this
one
dragged
up
and
sent
stinking
to
the
mandarins
well
one
possible
answer
was
at
the
history
of
these
three
men
and
in
the
light
of
that
history
i
say
that
philpott
and
burnett
should
have
been
ruthlessly
by
a
really
able
man
till
the
very
heart
of
them
both
lay
bare
whether
the
issue
would
have
been
different
i
do
know
but
at
least
there
would
have
been
some
justice
on
both
sides
and
it
may
even
be
that
a
trained
lawyer
could
not
only
have
got
at
the
heart
of
the
matter
but
also
prevailed
upon
the
court
not
to
be
prejudiced
against
him
by
his
getting
at
it
for
that
brings
you
back
to
the
real
trouble
i
could
have
done
it
myself
and
gladly
if
any
one
knew
anything
about
these
men
i
did
but
if
i
acting
for
harry
had
really
burnett
asked
him
suddenly
what
was
doing
in
that
and
when
he
hesitated
suggested
that
he
too
was
sheltering
and
quite
rightly
because
the
fire
was
so
heavy
or
if
i
brought
out
the
history
of
that
night
at
gallipoli
and
suggested
that
the
animosity
between
the
two
men
might
both
explain
harry
conduct
in
the
and
account
for
burnett
having
made
the
charge
in
the
first
place
thus
throwing
some
doubt
on
the
value
of
his
evidence
all
that
would
have
been
and
if
i
had
suggested
that
philpott
himself
my
might
have
some
slight
spite
against
the
accused
or
asked
him
why
he
had
applied
for
a
on
this
case
after
hushing
up
so
many
worse
ones
i
think
the
court
would
have
become
apoplectic
with
horror
at
the
sacrilege
then
again
it
had
been
fixed
that
travers
should
be
prisoner
friend
he
knew
more
about
the
papers
and
the
summary
of
evidence
and
so
on
than
any
one
though
as
the
papers
had
only
been
sent
down
the
morning
before
he
did
not
know
a
great
deal
so
we
left
it
at
that
travers
was
a
young
law
student
in
private
life
but
constitutionally
timid
of
authority
and
he
made
no
great
show
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
deputy
judge
advocate
a
person
supposed
to
assist
everybody
but
as
i
have
said
perhaps
it
was
as
well
for
what
they
thought
of
as
the
facts
of
the
case
were
all
that
mattered
to
the
court
and
as
related
by
philpott
and
burnett
and
peters
they
were
pretty
damning
that
bit
about
the
was
fatal
it
made
a
great
impression
both
the
prosecutor
and
two
of
the
court
asked
burnett
you
sure
he
was
if
he
had
only
been
away
from
the
enemy
it
would
have
made
so
much
difference
travers
did
ask
burnett
why
was
he
in
the
entrance
and
it
showed
you
what
a
mockery
any
kind
of
would
have
been
in
the
absence
of
writers
every
question
and
almost
every
answer
was
written
down
word
for
word
by
the
deputy
judge
advocate
after
a
question
was
put
there
was
a
lengthy
pause
while
the
officer
wrote
then
there
was
some
uncertainty
and
some
questions
about
the
exact
form
of
the
question
had
travers
said
were
you
in
the
or
did
you
go
to
the
finally
all
being
satisfactorily
settled
and
written
down
the
witness
was
allowed
to
answer
but
by
then
the
shiftiest
witness
had
had
time
to
invent
a
dozen
suitable
answers
no
liar
could
possibly
be
caught
out
no
deceiver
ever
be
detected
under
this
system
that
was
fair
to
the
witness
burnett
answered
of
course
that
he
had
gone
there
to
inquire
if
the
had
been
seen
to
do
burnett
justice
he
did
not
seem
at
all
happy
at
having
to
tell
his
tale
again
if
his
original
report
had
really
been
made
under
a
sudden
impulse
of
spite
and
revenge
and
however
that
may
be
he
could
certainly
have
made
a
very
different
report
i
think
perhaps
he
had
not
realized
how
far
the
matter
would
go
had
not
imagined
that
it
would
come
to
a
and
now
regretted
it
but
it
was
too
late
he
could
not
eat
his
words
and
that
was
the
devil
of
it
burnett
might
have
made
a
different
report
philpott
could
have
things
with
the
brigade
could
have
had
harry
sent
to
the
base
on
the
ground
of
his
record
and
medical
condition
and
not
have
applied
for
a
but
once
those
facts
came
before
the
court
to
be
examined
under
that
procedure
simply
as
facts
an
officer
ordered
up
with
a
party
and
important
stores
some
of
the
party
scattered
officer
seen
running
mind
you
in
the
wrong
direction
officer
on
the
evidence
of
his
men
and
refusing
to
obey
an
order
it
was
too
late
to
wonder
whether
the
case
should
ever
have
come
there
that
was
philpott
business
did
not
seem
disturbed
he
even
mentioned
casually
that
had
been
a
similar
incident
with
this
officer
once
before
when
his
conduct
with
a
by
no
means
satisfied
me
quite
apart
from
the
monstrous
misrepresentation
of
the
thing
the
statement
was
wholly
inadmissible
at
that
stage
and
the
president
stopped
him
but
that
also
was
too
late
it
had
sunk
in
and
so
the
evidence
went
slowly
on
unshaken
not
that
it
was
all
unshakable
no
one
tried
to
shake
it
after
philpott
came
peters
the
a
good
fellow
he
told
the
court
what
harry
had
said
about
back
to
wait
a
bit
instead
of
going
straight
on
when
the
party
collected
again
they
asked
him
there
any
reason
why
the
party
should
not
have
gone
on
then
sir
he
said
shelling
was
bad
and
we
should
have
had
some
casualties
but
i
daresay
we
should
have
got
through
i
seen
as
bad
before
then
there
was
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
with
harry
a
good
fellow
who
hated
being
there
he
told
the
story
of
the
movements
of
the
party
with
the
usual
broken
irrelevances
but
by
his
too
obvious
wish
to
help
harry
did
him
no
good
when
asked
what
condition
the
officer
was
he
said
sir
he
seemed
to
have
lost
his
nerve
like
we
all
of
us
had
as
far
as
that
goes
the
shelling
was
that
but
that
was
no
defence
for
harry
harry
could
either
a
statement
not
on
oath
or
give
evidence
on
oath
and
be
he
chose
the
latter
related
simply
the
movements
of
the
party
and
himself
and
did
not
deny
any
of
the
facts
of
which
evidence
had
already
been
given
you
had
collected
the
party
under
the
bank
by
this
corner
you
speak
of
said
the
president
did
you
not
then
proceed
with
the
party
thought
the
shelling
was
too
heavy
sir
just
then
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
go
back
and
wait
a
bit
where
there
was
more
cover
till
the
shelling
got
less
sergeant
peters
says
the
party
would
probably
have
got
through
sir
view
of
the
orders
you
had
received
would
it
have
been
better
to
go
straight
on
do
know
sir
perhaps
it
would
why
did
you
do
that
the
time
sir
i
thought
it
best
to
go
back
and
wait
that
was
what
you
were
doing
when
you
were
seen
er
running
to
the
sir
well
the
court
did
not
believe
it
and
i
can
not
blame
them
for
i
knew
that
harry
was
not
being
perfectly
ingenuous
i
knew
that
he
not
have
gone
on
yet
it
was
a
reasonable
story
and
if
the
court
had
been
able
to
imagine
themselves
in
harry
condition
of
mind
and
body
crouching
in
the
wet
dark
under
that
bank
faint
with
weariness
and
fear
shaken
with
those
blinding
tearing
concussions
not
knowing
what
they
should
do
or
what
they
do
perhaps
they
would
have
said
in
their
hearts
will
believe
that
story
but
they
could
not
imagine
it
for
they
were
naturally
men
and
they
had
not
seen
too
much
war
they
were
not
young
enough
and
indeed
it
was
not
their
business
to
imagine
that
another
of
the
court
asked
it
true
to
say
as
private
mallins
said
that
you
had
ah
lost
your
nerve
sir
i
had
the
pretty
badly
one
usually
does
at
that
corner
and
i
had
too
much
of
it
see
i
wondered
if
he
did
see
if
he
had
ever
had
much
of
it
harry
said
nothing
about
burnett
nothing
about
philpott
probably
it
would
have
done
no
good
and
as
he
told
me
afterwards
real
charge
was
that
i
lost
my
nerve
and
so
i
had
and
i
do
want
to
wangle
out
of
it
like
that
that
was
the
end
of
it
they
were
kind
enough
those
grey
men
they
did
not
like
the
job
and
they
wanted
only
to
do
their
duty
but
they
conceived
that
their
duty
was
down
in
the
book
to
look
at
the
facts
and
no
further
and
the
facts
were
very
hard
the
court
was
closed
while
they
considered
their
verdict
it
was
closed
for
forty
minutes
and
when
it
reopened
they
asked
for
evidence
of
character
and
that
meant
that
the
verdict
was
on
the
only
facts
they
had
succeeded
in
discovering
it
could
hardly
have
been
anything
else
the
adjutant
put
in
formal
evidence
of
harry
service
age
record
and
so
on
and
i
was
allowed
to
give
evidence
of
character
i
told
them
simply
the
sort
of
fighting
record
he
had
about
gallipoli
and
the
scouting
and
the
job
he
had
refused
in
england
i
am
glad
to
believe
that
i
did
him
a
little
good
for
that
evening
it
got
about
somehow
that
he
was
recommended
to
mercy
and
perhaps
they
remembered
that
he
was
xiii
that
evening
i
sat
in
c
company
mess
for
an
hour
and
talked
with
them
about
the
trial
they
were
very
sad
and
upset
at
this
thing
happening
in
the
regiment
but
they
were
reasonable
and
generous
not
like
those
d
company
pups
wallace
and
the
other
for
they
were
older
men
and
had
nearly
all
been
out
a
long
time
only
one
of
them
annoyed
me
a
fellow
in
the
thirties
making
a
good
income
in
the
city
who
had
only
joined
up
just
before
he
had
to
under
the
derby
scheme
and
had
been
out
a
month
this
fellow
was
very
strong
on
honour
of
the
regiment
and
seemed
to
think
it
desirable
for
that
that
harry
should
be
shot
though
how
the
honour
of
the
regiment
would
be
thereby
advanced
or
what
right
he
had
to
speak
for
it
i
could
not
discover
but
the
others
were
sensible
balanced
men
and
as
perplexed
and
troubled
as
i
had
been
thinking
over
a
thing
that
harry
had
said
in
his
talk
with
me
i
did
have
the
i
never
had
cold
feet
it
is
a
pity
one
can
not
avoid
these
horrible
terms
but
one
can
not
i
take
it
that
whatever
the
origin
of
that
extraordinary
expression
may
be
signifies
simply
feet
also
signifies
fear
but
as
i
understand
it
has
an
added
implication
in
it
of
to
that
fear
i
told
them
about
this
distinction
of
harry
and
asked
them
what
they
thought
it
said
smith
just
the
damned
shame
of
the
whole
thing
there
are
lots
of
men
who
are
simply
terrified
the
whole
time
they
out
but
just
go
on
sticking
it
by
sheer
guts
or
whatever
you
like
that
having
the
and
you
ca
prevent
it
it
just
depends
how
you
made
i
suppose
there
really
are
some
people
who
do
feel
fear
at
all
that
fellow
drake
for
example
though
not
sure
that
there
are
many
anyhow
if
there
are
any
they
deserve
much
credit
though
they
do
get
the
then
there
are
the
people
who
feel
fear
like
the
rest
of
us
and
do
make
any
effort
to
resist
it
do
join
up
or
come
out
and
when
they
have
to
go
back
after
three
months
with
a
blighty
one
and
get
a
job
and
stay
there
when
they
are
here
wangle
out
of
all
the
dirty
jobs
put
in
foster
they
the
people
with
cold
feet
if
you
like
smith
went
on
as
you
say
penrose
has
never
been
like
that
fellows
like
him
keep
on
coming
out
time
after
time
getting
worse
every
time
but
simply
kicking
themselves
out
until
they
come
out
once
too
often
and
stop
one
or
break
up
suddenly
like
penrose
and
the
question
is
ought
any
man
like
that
to
be
shot
asked
foster
any
one
who
to
fight
for
his
country
be
shot
said
another
it
yes
said
constable
he
was
a
square
old
boy
a
promoted
and
a
very
useful
officer
must
have
some
sort
of
standard
or
where
would
the
army
be
do
know
said
foster
at
the
australians
they
do
have
a
and
i
reckon
they
as
good
as
us
my
son
perhaps
that
the
reason
this
was
old
constable
again
average
australian
is
naturally
a
sight
than
the
average
englishman
they
do
need
it
why
the
hell
do
they
punish
englishmen
worse
than
australians
if
they
ca
even
be
to
do
so
well
retorted
foster
but
this
piece
of
dialectics
was
lost
on
constable
i
do
see
that
it
need
be
such
an
absolute
standard
smith
began
again
thoughtfully
he
was
a
thoughtful
young
fellow
expect
everybody
to
have
equally
strong
arms
or
equally
good
brains
and
if
a
chap
legs
or
arms
are
strong
enough
for
him
to
go
on
living
in
the
trenches
they
take
him
out
of
it
if
he
lucky
but
every
expected
to
have
equally
strong
nerves
in
all
circumstances
and
to
on
having
till
he
goes
under
and
when
he
goes
under
they
consider
how
far
his
nerves
or
guts
or
whatever
you
call
it
were
as
good
as
other
people
even
if
he
had
nerves
like
a
chicken
to
begin
with
he
expected
to
behave
as
a
man
with
nerves
like
a
lion
or
a
drake
would
do
man
with
nerves
like
a
chicken
is
a
damned
fool
to
go
into
the
infantry
at
all
put
in
williams
honour
of
the
regiment
person
but
he
may
have
had
a
like
a
lion
and
simply
made
himself
do
it
be
all
right
smith
somebody
said
you
did
use
such
long
words
what
the
hell
do
you
mean
by
an
absolute
standard
george
i
forgot
you
were
so
ignorant
what
i
mean
is
this
take
a
case
like
penrose
all
they
ask
is
was
he
seen
running
the
wrong
way
or
not
going
the
right
way
if
the
answer
is
yes
the
punishment
is
death
cetera
et
to
begin
with
as
i
said
they
consider
whether
he
was
physically
or
mentally
i
do
know
which
it
is
of
doing
the
right
thing
and
then
there
are
lots
of
other
things
which
know
make
one
man
more
windy
than
another
or
windier
than
he
was
yesterday
things
like
being
a
married
man
or
having
boils
or
a
bad
cold
or
being
just
physically
weak
so
that
you
get
so
exhausted
you
have
got
any
strength
left
to
resist
your
fears
i
had
that
feeling
myself
none
of
those
things
are
considered
at
a
and
i
think
they
ought
to
be
said
foster
ought
to
be
considered
they
decide
to
have
a
at
all
a
case
like
penrose
never
ought
to
have
got
so
far
right
i
do
know
why
the
devil
it
did
all
said
williams
got
to
consider
the
name
of
the
regiment
what
would
happen
but
i
could
not
stand
any
more
of
that
think
smith
on
the
right
line
i
said
i
do
know
if
it
would
ever
be
workable
there
are
of
course
lots
of
fellows
who
things
far
more
than
most
of
us
sensitive
imaginative
fellows
like
poor
penrose
and
it
must
be
hell
for
them
of
course
there
are
some
men
like
that
with
enormously
strong
wills
who
manage
to
stick
it
out
as
well
as
anybody
and
do
awfully
well
i
should
think
young
aston
for
instance
and
those
i
call
the
brave
men
anyhow
if
a
man
like
that
really
does
stick
it
as
long
as
he
can
i
think
something
ought
to
be
done
for
him
though
i
damned
if
i
know
what
he
ought
ought
to
be
to
go
on
too
long
that
what
it
comes
to
said
smith
what
do
you
want
foster
asked
kind
of
periodical
examination
the
kind
of
thing
i
suppose
it
a
medical
question
really
only
the
doctors
do
seem
to
recognize
or
else
they
allowed
to
any
stage
between
absolute
with
your
legs
flying
in
all
directions
and
just
ordinary
damn
it
man
constable
exploded
at
the
you
get
if
you
have
that
sort
of
thing
you
have
all
the
darlings
in
the
kingdom
saying
they
had
enough
when
they
got
to
the
base
no
i
think
that
silly
i
do
know
what
it
is
that
gives
you
bad
after
a
long
time
out
here
nerves
or
imagination
or
emotion
or
what
but
it
seems
to
me
the
doctors
ought
to
be
able
to
test
when
a
man
really
had
enough
just
as
they
tell
whether
a
man
knee
or
a
man
heart
are
really
bad
or
not
you
have
to
take
his
record
into
account
of
course
you
have
to
make
it
a
compulsory
test
said
smith
nowadays
no
one
going
to
go
into
a
board
and
say
look
here
doctor
i
been
out
so
long
and
i
ca
stand
any
more
they
send
you
out
in
the
next
draft
both
ways
added
foster
they
decided
he
done
enough
and
was
any
longer
he
ought
to
be
to
do
any
more
because
he
dangerous
to
himself
and
everybody
else
footnote
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
long
after
the
supposed
date
of
this
conversation
a
system
of
sending
soldiers
home
for
six
months
at
a
time
was
instituted
though
i
doubt
if
foster
would
have
been
satisfied
with
that
a
matter
of
fact
said
williams
what
usually
does
happen
does
it
when
a
chap
gets
down
and
out
like
that
after
a
decent
spell
of
it
he
usually
gets
a
job
at
home
instructor
at
the
depot
or
something
and
then
you
get
a
fellow
with
the
devil
of
a
conscience
like
penrose
and
you
have
a
nasty
mess
like
this
what
about
the
men
asked
constable
you
going
to
have
the
same
thing
for
them
only
thank
god
there
are
not
so
many
of
them
who
need
it
all
that
chat
you
read
about
the
wonderful
fatalism
of
the
british
soldier
is
so
much
bunkum
it
simply
means
that
most
of
them
are
not
cursed
with
an
imagination
and
so
do
worry
about
what
coming
true
you
do
see
many
fatalists
in
the
middle
of
a
big
strafe
course
there
lots
of
them
who
made
like
penrose
and
with
a
record
like
his
something
it
damned
lucky
for
the
british
army
there
are
not
more
of
them
put
in
constable
but
it
damned
unlucky
for
them
to
be
in
the
british
army
in
the
infantry
anyhow
what
does
that
matter
well
you
can
take
that
line
if
you
like
but
it
a
bit
prussian
is
it
winning
this
dirty
war
anyhow
at
present
so
the
talk
rambled
on
and
we
got
no
further
only
most
of
us
were
in
troubled
agreement
that
something
perhaps
many
things
were
wrong
about
the
system
if
this
young
volunteer
after
long
fighting
and
suffering
was
indeed
to
be
shot
like
a
traitor
in
the
cold
dawn
nine
times
out
of
ten
as
williams
had
said
we
knew
that
it
would
not
have
happened
simply
because
nine
men
out
of
ten
surrender
in
time
but
ought
the
tenth
case
to
be
even
remotely
possible
that
was
our
doubt
what
exactly
was
wrong
we
could
not
pretend
to
say
it
was
not
our
business
but
if
this
was
the
best
the
old
men
could
do
we
felt
that
we
could
help
them
a
little
i
give
you
this
scrap
of
conversation
only
to
show
the
kind
of
feeling
there
was
in
the
regiment
because
that
is
the
surest
test
of
the
rightness
of
these
things
they
were
still
at
it
when
i
left
and
as
i
went
out
wearily
into
the
cold
drizzle
i
heard
foster
summing
up
his
views
with
the
whole
thing
damned
awful
they
recommended
him
to
mercy
have
they
and
i
hope
to
god
he
gets
it
ii
but
he
got
no
mercy
the
sentence
was
confirmed
by
the
higher
authorities
i
can
not
pretend
to
what
happened
but
from
some
experience
of
the
military
hierarchy
i
can
imagine
i
can
see
those
papers
wrapped
up
in
the
blue
form
with
all
the
right
information
beautifully
inscribed
in
the
right
spaces
very
neat
and
precise
carefully
sealed
in
the
long
envelopes
and
sent
wandering
up
through
the
rarefied
atmosphere
of
the
higher
formations
very
early
they
halt
at
the
brigadier
or
perhaps
the
divisional
general
some
one
who
thinks
of
himself
as
a
man
of
and
iron
he
looks
upon
the
papers
he
reads
the
evidence
very
carefully
at
the
end
he
sees
to
mercy
very
well
but
we
must
make
an
example
sometimes
where
that
confidential
memo
we
had
the
other
day
that
it
yes
officer
who
fails
in
his
duty
must
be
treated
with
the
same
severity
as
would
be
awarded
to
private
in
the
same
circumstances
quite
right
too
sha
approve
recommendation
to
mercy
just
write
on
it
see
no
reason
why
sentence
should
not
be
carried
out
and
i
sign
it
or
more
simply
perhaps
mercy
be
damned
must
make
an
example
i
wo
have
any
cold
feet
in
my
command
and
so
the
blue
form
goes
climbing
on
burdened
now
with
that
fatal
endorsement
labouring
over
ridge
after
ridge
and
on
each
successive
height
the
atmosphere
becomes
more
rarefied
though
the
population
is
more
numerous
and
at
long
last
it
comes
to
some
olympian
peak
i
know
not
where
beyond
which
it
may
not
go
where
the
air
is
so
chill
and
the
population
so
dense
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
breathe
yet
here
i
make
no
doubt
they
look
at
the
blue
form
very
carefully
and
gravely
as
becomes
the
high
gods
but
in
the
end
they
shake
their
heads
a
little
sadly
maybe
and
say
general
b
does
not
approve
recommendation
to
mercy
he
the
man
on
the
spot
he
ought
to
know
support
sentence
confirmed
then
the
blue
form
climbs
sadly
down
to
the
depths
again
to
the
low
regions
where
men
feel
fear
the
thing
was
done
seven
mornings
later
in
a
little
orchard
behind
the
casquettes
farm
the
padre
told
me
he
stood
up
to
them
very
bravely
and
quietly
only
he
whispered
to
him
god
sake
make
them
be
quick
that
is
the
worst
torment
of
the
soldier
from
beginning
to
end
the
waiting
iii
after
three
months
i
had
some
leave
and
visited
harry
i
had
to
but
i
shall
not
distress
you
with
an
account
of
that
interview
i
will
not
even
pretend
that
she
was
how
could
she
be
only
when
i
had
explained
things
to
her
as
harry
had
asked
she
said
that
does
make
it
easier
for
me
and
i
only
wish
i
wish
you
could
tell
everybody
what
you
have
told
me
and
again
i
say
that
is
all
i
have
tried
to
do
this
book
is
not
an
attack
on
any
person
on
the
death
penalty
or
on
anything
else
though
if
it
makes
people
think
about
these
things
so
much
the
better
i
think
i
believe
in
the
death
penalty
i
do
know
but
i
did
not
believe
in
harry
being
shot
that
is
the
gist
of
it
that
my
friend
harry
was
shot
for
cowardice
and
he
was
one
of
the
bravest
men
i
ever
knew
