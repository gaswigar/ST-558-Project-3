the
wreck
of
the
lady
tozer
adjusted
her
with
an
air
of
dignified
aggressiveness
she
had
lived
too
many
years
in
the
far
east
in
hong
kong
she
was
known
as
the
mandarin
her
powers
of
merciless
inquisition
suggested
torments
long
drawn
out
the
commander
of
the
homeward
bound
from
shanghai
knew
that
he
was
about
to
be
stretched
on
the
rack
when
he
took
his
seat
at
the
saloon
table
is
it
true
captain
that
we
are
running
into
a
typhoon
demanded
her
ladyship
from
whom
did
you
learn
that
lady
tozer
captain
ross
was
wary
though
somewhat
surprised
from
miss
deane
i
understood
her
a
moment
ago
to
say
that
you
had
told
her
i
did
you
some
one
told
me
this
morning
i
could
have
guessed
it
could
i
miss
iris
deane
large
blue
eyes
surveyed
him
with
innocent
indifference
to
strict
accuracy
incidentally
she
had
obtained
the
information
from
her
maid
a
coquette
who
extracted
secrets
from
a
youthful
quartermaster
well
er
i
had
forgotten
explained
the
tactful
sailor
is
it
true
lady
tozer
unusually
abrupt
today
but
she
was
annoyed
by
the
assumption
that
the
captain
took
a
mere
girl
into
his
confidence
and
passed
over
the
wife
of
the
justice
of
hong
kong
yes
it
is
said
captain
ross
equally
curt
and
silently
thanking
the
fates
that
her
ladyship
was
going
home
for
the
last
time
how
horrible
she
gasped
in
unaffected
alarm
this
return
to
femininity
soothed
the
sailor
ruffled
temper
sir
john
her
husband
frowned
judicially
that
frown
constituted
his
legal
yet
it
passed
current
for
wisdom
with
the
hong
kong
bar
what
evidence
have
you
he
asked
do
tell
us
chimed
in
iris
delightfully
unconscious
of
interrupting
the
court
did
you
find
out
when
you
squinted
at
the
sun
the
captain
smiled
you
are
nearer
the
mark
than
possibly
you
imagine
miss
deane
he
said
when
we
took
our
observations
yesterday
there
was
a
very
halo
around
the
sun
this
morning
you
may
have
noticed
several
light
squalls
and
a
smooth
sea
marked
occasionally
by
strong
ripples
the
barometer
is
falling
rapidly
and
i
expect
that
as
the
day
wears
we
will
encounter
a
heavy
swell
if
the
sky
looks
wild
tonight
and
especially
if
we
observe
a
heavy
bank
of
cloud
approaching
from
the
you
see
the
crockery
dancing
about
the
table
at
dinner
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
a
good
sailor
lady
tozer
are
you
miss
deane
capital
i
should
just
love
to
see
a
real
storm
now
promise
me
solemnly
that
you
will
take
me
up
into
the
charthouse
when
this
typhoon
is
simply
tearing
things
to
pieces
oh
dear
i
do
hope
it
will
not
be
very
bad
is
there
no
way
in
which
you
can
avoid
it
captain
will
it
last
long
the
politic
skipper
for
once
preferred
to
answer
lady
tozer
there
is
no
cause
for
uneasiness
he
said
of
course
typhoons
in
the
china
sea
are
nasty
things
while
they
last
but
a
ship
like
the
is
not
troubled
by
them
she
will
drive
through
the
worst
gale
she
is
likely
to
meet
here
in
less
than
twelve
hours
besides
i
alter
the
course
somewhat
as
soon
as
i
discover
our
position
with
regard
to
its
center
you
see
miss
deane
and
captain
ross
forthwith
illustrated
on
the
back
of
a
menu
card
the
spiral
shape
and
progress
of
a
cyclone
he
so
thoroughly
mystified
the
girl
by
his
technical
references
to
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
polar
directions
revolving
external
circumferences
and
diminished
atmospheric
pressures
that
she
was
too
bewildered
to
reiterate
a
desire
to
visit
the
bridge
then
the
commander
hurriedly
excused
himself
and
the
passengers
saw
no
more
of
him
that
day
but
his
short
scientific
lecture
achieved
a
double
result
it
rescued
him
from
a
request
which
he
could
not
possibly
grant
and
reassured
lady
tozer
to
the
mind
it
is
the
unknown
that
is
fearful
a
storm
classed
as
periodic
whose
velocity
can
be
measured
whose
duration
and
direction
can
be
determined
beforehand
by
hours
and
distances
ceases
to
be
terrifying
it
becomes
an
accepted
fact
akin
to
the
and
the
electric
telegraph
marvelous
yet
commonplace
so
her
ladyship
dismissed
the
topic
as
of
no
present
interest
and
focused
miss
deane
through
her
sir
arthur
proposes
to
come
home
in
june
i
understand
she
inquired
iris
was
a
remarkably
healthy
young
woman
a
large
banana
momentarily
engaged
her
attention
she
nodded
affably
you
will
stay
with
relatives
until
he
arrives
pursued
lady
tozer
the
banana
is
a
fruit
of
simple
characteristics
the
girl
was
able
to
reply
with
a
touch
of
careless
hauteur
in
her
voice
relatives
we
have
none
none
whom
we
specially
cultivate
that
is
i
will
stop
in
town
a
day
or
two
to
interview
my
dressmaker
and
then
go
straight
to
helmdale
our
place
in
yorkshire
surely
you
have
a
chaperon
a
chaperon
my
dear
lady
tozer
did
my
father
impress
you
as
one
who
would
permit
a
fussy
and
stout
old
person
to
make
my
life
miserable
the
acidity
of
the
retort
lay
in
the
word
stout
but
iris
was
not
accustomed
to
during
a
three
months
residence
on
the
island
she
had
learnt
how
to
avoid
lady
tozer
here
it
was
impossible
and
the
older
woman
fastened
upon
her
miss
iris
deane
was
a
toothsome
morsel
for
gossip
not
yet
the
only
daughter
of
a
wealthy
baronet
who
owned
a
fleet
of
stately
ships
the
amongst
them
a
girl
who
had
been
mistress
of
her
father
house
since
her
return
from
dresden
three
years
ago
young
beautiful
rich
here
was
a
combination
for
which
men
thanked
a
judicious
heaven
whilst
women
sniffed
enviously
business
detained
sir
arthur
a
the
two
great
divisions
of
the
yellow
race
he
must
wait
to
see
how
matters
developed
but
he
would
not
expose
iris
to
the
insidious
treachery
of
a
chinese
spring
so
with
tears
they
separated
she
was
confided
to
the
personal
charge
of
captain
ross
at
each
point
of
call
the
agents
would
be
solicitous
for
her
welfare
the
cable
telegraphic
eye
would
watch
her
progress
as
that
of
some
princely
maiden
sailing
in
royal
caravel
this
fair
slender
girl
delightfully
english
in
face
and
figure
with
her
fresh
clear
complexion
limpid
blue
eyes
and
shining
brown
hair
was
a
personage
of
some
importance
lady
tozer
knew
these
things
and
sighed
complacently
ah
well
she
resumed
parents
had
different
views
when
i
was
a
girl
but
i
assume
sir
arthur
thinks
you
should
become
used
to
being
your
own
mistress
in
view
of
your
approaching
marriage
my
approaching
marriage
cried
iris
now
genuinely
amazed
yes
is
it
not
true
that
you
are
going
to
marry
lord
ventnor
a
passing
steward
heard
the
question
it
had
a
curious
effect
upon
him
he
gazed
with
fiercely
eager
eyes
at
miss
deane
and
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
permit
a
dish
of
water
ice
to
rest
against
sir
john
tozer
bald
head
iris
could
not
help
noting
his
strange
behavior
a
flash
of
humor
chased
away
her
first
angry
resentment
at
lady
tozer
interrogatory
that
may
be
my
happy
fate
she
answered
gaily
but
lord
ventnor
has
not
asked
me
every
one
says
in
hong
kong
began
her
ladyship
confound
you
you
stupid
rascal
what
are
you
doing
shouted
sir
john
his
feeble
nerves
at
last
conveyed
the
information
that
something
more
pronounced
than
a
sudden
draught
affected
his
scalp
the
ice
was
melting
the
incident
amused
those
passengers
who
sat
near
enough
to
observe
it
but
the
chief
steward
hovering
watchful
near
the
captain
table
darted
forward
pale
with
anger
he
hissed
report
yourself
for
duty
in
the
second
saloon
tonight
and
he
hustled
his
subordinate
away
from
the
judge
chair
miss
deane
mirthfully
radiant
rose
please
do
punish
the
man
jones
she
said
sweetly
it
was
a
sheer
accident
he
was
taken
by
surprise
in
his
place
i
would
have
emptied
the
whole
dish
the
chief
steward
smirked
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
had
happened
nevertheless
great
though
sir
john
tozer
might
be
the
daughter
was
greater
certainly
miss
certainly
he
agreed
adding
confidentially
it
rather
hard
on
a
steward
to
be
sent
aft
miss
it
makes
such
a
difference
in
the
er
the
little
gratuities
given
by
the
passengers
the
girl
was
tactful
she
smiled
comprehension
at
the
official
and
bent
over
sir
john
now
carefully
polishing
the
back
of
his
skull
with
a
table
napkin
i
am
sure
you
will
forgive
him
she
whispered
i
ca
say
why
but
the
poor
fellow
was
looking
so
intently
at
me
that
he
did
not
see
what
he
was
doing
the
justice
was
instantly
mollified
he
did
not
mind
the
application
of
ice
in
that
way
rather
liked
it
in
fact
probably
ice
was
susceptible
to
the
fire
in
miss
deane
eyes
lady
tozer
was
not
so
easily
appeased
when
iris
left
the
saloon
she
inquired
tartly
how
is
it
john
that
government
makes
a
shipowner
a
baronet
and
a
chief
justice
only
a
knight
that
question
would
provide
an
interesting
subject
for
debate
at
the
carlton
my
dear
he
replied
with
equal
asperity
suddenly
the
passengers
still
seated
experienced
a
prolonged
sinking
sensation
as
if
the
vessel
had
been
converted
into
a
gigantic
lift
they
were
pressed
hard
into
their
chairs
which
creaked
and
tried
to
swing
round
on
their
pivots
as
the
ship
yielded
stiffly
to
the
sea
a
whiff
of
spray
dashed
through
an
open
port
there
snapped
her
ladyship
i
knew
we
should
run
into
a
storm
yet
captain
ross
led
us
to
believe
john
take
me
to
my
cabin
at
once
from
the
promenade
deck
the
listless
groups
watched
the
rapid
advance
of
the
gale
there
was
mournful
speculation
upon
the
chances
of
reaching
singapore
before
the
next
evening
we
had
two
hundred
and
miles
to
do
at
noon
said
experience
if
the
wind
and
sea
catch
us
on
the
port
bow
the
ship
will
pitch
awfully
half
the
time
the
screw
will
be
racing
i
once
made
this
trip
in
the
and
we
were
struck
by
a
typhoon
in
this
locality
how
long
do
you
think
it
was
before
we
dropped
anchor
in
singapore
harbor
no
one
hazarded
a
guess
three
days
experience
was
solemnly
pompous
three
whole
days
they
were
like
three
years
by
jove
i
never
want
to
see
another
gale
like
that
a
timid
lady
ventured
to
say
perhaps
this
may
not
be
a
typhoon
it
may
only
be
a
little
bit
of
a
storm
her
sex
saved
her
from
a
jeer
experience
gloomily
shook
his
head
the
barometer
resists
your
plea
he
said
i
fear
there
will
be
a
good
many
empty
saddles
in
the
saloon
at
dinner
the
lady
smiled
weakly
it
was
a
feeble
joke
at
the
best
you
think
we
are
in
for
a
sort
of
marine
she
asked
well
thank
heaven
i
had
a
good
lunch
sniggered
a
subaltern
and
a
ripple
of
laughter
greeted
his
enthusiasm
iris
stood
somewhat
apart
from
the
speakers
the
wind
had
freshened
and
her
hat
was
tied
closely
over
her
ears
she
leaned
against
the
taffrail
enjoying
the
cool
breeze
after
hours
of
sultry
heat
the
sky
was
cloudless
yet
but
there
was
a
queer
tinge
of
burnished
copper
in
the
sunshine
the
sea
was
coldly
blue
the
life
had
gone
out
of
it
it
was
no
longer
inviting
and
translucent
that
morning
were
such
a
thing
practicable
she
would
have
gladly
dived
into
its
crystal
depths
and
disported
herself
like
a
frolicsome
mermaid
now
something
akin
to
repulsion
came
with
the
fanciful
remembrance
long
sullen
undulations
swept
noiselessly
past
the
ship
once
after
a
steady
climb
up
a
rolling
hill
of
water
the
quickly
pecked
at
the
succeeding
valley
and
the
propeller
gave
a
couple
of
angry
flaps
on
the
surface
whilst
a
tremor
ran
through
the
stout
iron
rails
on
which
the
girl
arms
rested
the
crew
were
busy
too
squads
of
lascars
raced
about
industriously
obedient
to
the
short
shrill
whistling
of
jemadars
and
quartermasters
boat
lashings
were
tested
and
tightened
canvas
awnings
stretched
across
the
deck
forward
ventilator
cowls
twisted
to
new
angles
and
hatches
clamped
down
over
the
wooden
gratings
that
covered
the
holds
officers
spotless
in
white
linen
flitted
quietly
to
and
fro
when
the
watch
was
changed
iris
noted
that
the
chief
appeared
in
an
old
blue
suit
and
carried
oilskins
over
his
arm
as
he
climbed
to
the
bridge
nature
looked
disturbed
and
fitful
and
the
ship
responded
to
her
mood
there
was
a
sense
of
preparation
in
the
air
of
coming
ordeal
of
restless
foreboding
chains
clanked
with
a
noise
the
girl
never
noticed
before
the
tramp
of
hurrying
men
on
the
hurricane
deck
overhead
sounded
heavy
and
hollow
there
was
a
squeaking
of
chairs
that
was
abominable
when
people
gathered
up
books
and
wraps
and
staggered
ungracefully
towards
the
altogether
miss
deane
was
not
wholly
pleased
with
the
preliminaries
of
a
typhoon
whatever
the
realities
might
be
and
then
why
did
gales
always
spring
up
at
the
close
of
day
could
they
not
start
after
breakfast
rage
with
furious
grandeur
during
lunch
and
die
away
peacefully
at
permitting
one
to
sleep
in
comfort
without
that
straining
and
groaning
of
the
ship
which
seemed
to
imply
a
sharp
attack
of
rheumatism
in
every
joint
why
did
that
silly
old
woman
allude
to
her
contemplated
marriage
to
lord
ventnor
retailing
the
gossip
of
hong
kong
with
such
malicious
emphasis
for
an
instant
iris
tried
to
shake
the
railing
in
comic
anger
she
hated
lord
ventnor
she
did
not
want
to
marry
him
or
anybody
else
just
yet
of
course
her
father
had
hinted
approval
of
his
lordship
obvious
intentions
countess
of
ventnor
yes
it
was
a
nice
title
still
she
wanted
another
couple
of
years
of
careless
freedom
in
any
event
why
should
lady
tozer
pry
and
probe
and
finally
why
did
the
steward
oh
poor
old
sir
john
what
have
happened
if
the
ice
had
slid
down
his
neck
thoroughly
comforted
by
this
gleeful
hypothesis
miss
deane
seized
a
favorable
opportunity
to
dart
across
to
the
starboard
side
and
see
if
captain
ross
heavy
bank
of
cloud
in
the
had
put
in
an
appearance
ha
there
it
was
black
ominous
gigantic
rolling
up
over
the
horizon
like
some
monstrous
football
around
it
the
sky
deepened
into
purple
fringed
with
a
wide
belt
of
brick
red
she
had
never
seen
such
a
beginning
of
a
gale
from
what
she
had
read
in
books
she
imagined
that
only
in
great
deserts
were
clouds
of
dust
generated
there
could
not
be
dust
in
the
dense
pall
now
rushing
with
giant
strides
across
the
trembling
sea
then
what
was
it
why
was
it
so
dark
and
menacing
and
where
was
desert
of
stone
and
sand
to
compare
with
this
awful
expanse
of
water
what
a
small
dot
was
this
great
ship
on
the
visible
surface
but
the
ocean
itself
extended
away
beyond
there
reaching
out
to
the
infinite
the
dot
became
a
mere
speck
undistinguishable
beneath
a
celestial
microscope
such
as
the
gods
might
condescend
to
use
iris
shivered
and
aroused
herself
with
a
startled
laugh
a
nice
book
in
a
sheltered
corner
and
perhaps
forty
winks
until
surely
a
much
more
sensible
proceeding
than
to
stand
there
idly
conjuring
up
phantoms
of
affright
the
lively
fanfare
of
the
dinner
trumpet
failed
to
fill
the
saloon
by
this
time
the
was
fighting
resolutely
against
a
stiff
gale
but
the
stress
of
actual
combat
was
better
than
the
eerie
sensation
of
impending
danger
during
the
earlier
hours
the
strong
hearty
pulsations
of
the
engines
the
regular
thrashing
of
the
screw
the
steadfast
onward
plunging
of
the
good
ship
through
racing
seas
and
flying
scud
were
cheery
confident
and
inspiring
miss
deane
justified
her
boast
that
she
was
an
excellent
sailor
she
smiled
delightedly
at
the
ship
surgeon
when
he
caught
her
eye
through
the
many
gaps
in
the
tables
she
was
alone
so
he
joined
her
you
are
a
credit
to
the
company
quite
a
daughter
he
said
doctor
do
you
talk
to
all
your
lady
passengers
in
that
way
alas
no
too
often
i
can
only
be
truthful
when
i
am
dumb
iris
laughed
if
i
remain
long
on
this
ship
i
will
certainly
have
my
head
turned
she
cried
i
receive
nothing
but
compliments
from
the
captain
down
to
to
the
doctor
no
you
come
a
good
second
on
the
list
in
very
truth
she
was
thinking
of
the
steward
and
his
queer
start
of
surprise
at
the
announcement
of
her
rumored
engagement
the
man
interested
her
he
looked
like
a
gentleman
her
quick
eyes
traveled
around
the
saloon
to
discover
his
whereabouts
she
could
not
see
him
the
chief
steward
stood
near
balancing
himself
in
apparent
defiance
of
the
laws
of
gravitation
for
the
ship
was
now
pitching
and
rolling
with
a
mad
zeal
for
an
instant
she
meant
to
inquire
what
had
become
of
the
transgressor
but
she
dismissed
the
thought
at
its
inception
the
matter
was
too
trivial
with
a
wild
swoop
all
the
plates
glasses
and
cutlery
on
the
saloon
tables
crashed
to
starboard
were
it
not
for
the
restraint
of
the
fiddles
everything
must
have
been
swept
to
the
floor
there
were
one
or
two
minor
accidents
a
steward
taken
unawares
was
thrown
headlong
on
top
of
his
laden
tray
others
were
compelled
to
clutch
the
backs
of
chairs
and
cling
to
pillars
one
man
involuntarily
seized
the
hair
of
a
lady
who
devoted
an
hour
before
each
meal
to
her
coiffure
the
with
a
frenzied
bound
tried
to
turn
a
somersault
a
change
of
course
observed
the
doctor
they
generally
try
to
avoid
it
when
people
are
in
the
saloon
but
a
typhoon
admits
of
no
labored
politeness
as
its
center
is
now
right
ahead
we
are
going
on
the
starboard
tack
to
get
behind
it
i
must
hurry
up
and
go
on
deck
said
miss
deane
you
will
not
be
able
to
go
on
deck
until
the
morning
she
turned
on
him
impetuously
indeed
i
will
captain
ross
promised
me
that
is
i
asked
him
the
doctor
smiled
she
was
so
charmingly
insistent
it
is
simply
impossible
he
said
the
companion
doors
are
bolted
the
promenade
deck
is
swept
by
heavy
seas
every
minute
a
boat
has
been
carried
away
and
several
stanchions
snapped
off
like
carrots
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
miss
deane
you
are
battened
down
the
girl
face
must
have
paled
somewhat
he
added
hastily
there
is
no
danger
you
know
but
these
precautions
are
necessary
you
would
not
like
to
see
several
tons
of
water
rushing
down
the
saloon
stairs
now
would
you
decidedly
not
then
after
a
pause
it
is
not
pleasant
to
be
fastened
up
in
a
great
iron
box
doctor
it
reminds
one
of
a
huge
coffin
not
a
bit
the
is
the
safest
ship
afloat
your
father
has
always
pursued
a
splendid
policy
in
that
respect
the
london
and
hong
kong
company
may
not
possess
fast
vessels
but
they
are
seaworthy
and
well
found
in
every
respect
are
there
many
people
ill
on
board
no
just
the
usual
number
of
disturbed
livers
we
had
a
nasty
accident
shortly
before
dinner
good
gracious
what
happened
some
lascars
were
caught
by
a
sea
forward
one
man
had
his
leg
broken
anything
else
the
doctor
hesitated
he
became
interested
in
the
color
of
some
burgundy
i
hardly
know
the
exact
details
yet
he
replied
tomorrow
after
breakfast
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
an
english
quartermaster
and
four
lascars
had
been
licked
from
off
the
forecastle
by
the
greedy
tongue
of
a
huge
wave
the
succeeding
surge
flung
the
five
men
back
against
the
quarter
one
of
the
black
sailors
was
pitched
aboard
with
a
fractured
leg
and
other
injuries
the
others
were
smashed
against
the
iron
hull
and
disappeared
for
one
tremulous
moment
the
engines
slowed
the
ship
commenced
to
veer
off
into
the
path
of
the
cyclone
captain
ross
set
his
teeth
and
the
telegraph
bell
jangled
full
speed
ahead
poor
jackson
he
murmured
one
of
my
best
men
i
remember
seeing
his
wife
a
pretty
little
woman
and
two
children
coming
to
meet
him
last
homeward
trip
they
will
be
there
again
good
god
that
lascar
who
was
saved
has
some
one
to
await
him
in
a
bombay
village
i
suppose
the
gale
sang
a
mad
requiem
to
its
victims
the
very
surface
was
torn
from
the
sea
the
ship
drove
relentlessly
through
sheets
of
spray
that
caused
the
officers
high
up
on
the
bridge
to
gasp
for
breath
they
held
on
by
main
force
though
protected
by
strong
canvas
sheets
bound
to
the
rails
the
main
deck
was
quite
impassable
the
promenade
deck
even
the
lofty
spar
deck
was
scourged
with
the
broken
crests
of
waves
that
tried
with
demoniac
energy
to
smash
in
the
starboard
bow
for
the
was
cutting
into
the
heart
of
the
cyclone
the
captain
fought
his
way
to
the
charthouse
he
wiped
the
salt
water
from
his
eyes
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
barometer
still
falling
he
muttered
i
will
keep
on
until
seven
and
then
bear
three
points
to
the
southward
by
midnight
we
should
be
behind
it
he
struggled
back
into
the
outside
fury
by
comparison
the
sturdy
citadel
he
quitted
was
paradise
on
the
edge
of
an
inferno
down
in
the
saloon
the
hardier
passengers
were
striving
to
subdue
the
ennui
of
an
interval
before
they
sought
their
cabins
some
talked
one
hardened
reprobate
strummed
the
piano
others
played
cards
chess
draughts
anything
that
would
distract
attention
the
stately
apartment
offered
strange
contrast
to
the
warring
elements
without
bright
lights
costly
upholstery
soft
carpets
carved
panels
and
gilded
cornices
with
uniformed
attendants
passing
to
and
fro
carrying
coffee
and
glasses
these
surroundings
suggested
a
floating
palace
in
which
the
raging
seas
were
defied
yet
forty
miles
away
somewhere
in
the
furious
depths
four
corpses
swirled
about
with
horrible
uncertainty
lurching
through
battling
currents
and
perchance
convoyed
by
fighting
sharks
the
surgeon
had
been
called
away
iris
was
the
only
lady
left
in
the
saloon
she
watched
a
set
of
whist
players
for
a
time
and
then
essayed
the
perilous
passage
to
her
stateroom
she
found
her
maid
and
a
stewardess
there
both
women
were
weeping
what
is
the
matter
she
inquired
the
stewardess
tried
to
speak
she
choked
with
grief
and
hastily
went
out
the
maid
blubbered
an
explanation
a
friend
of
hers
was
married
miss
to
the
man
who
is
drowned
drowned
what
man
have
you
heard
miss
i
suppose
they
are
keeping
it
quiet
an
english
sailor
and
some
natives
were
swept
off
the
ship
by
a
sea
one
native
was
saved
but
he
is
all
smashed
up
the
others
were
never
seen
again
iris
by
degrees
learnt
the
sad
chronicles
of
the
jackson
family
she
was
moved
to
tears
she
remembered
the
doctor
hesitancy
and
her
own
idle
phrase
a
huge
coffin
outside
the
roaring
waves
pounded
upon
the
iron
walls
were
they
not
satiated
this
tragedy
had
taken
all
the
grandeur
out
of
the
storm
it
was
no
longer
a
majestic
phase
of
nature
power
but
an
implacable
demon
bellowing
for
a
sacrifice
and
that
poor
woman
with
her
two
children
hopefully
scanning
the
shipping
lists
for
news
of
the
great
steamer
news
which
to
her
meant
only
the
safety
of
her
husband
oh
it
was
pitiful
iris
would
not
be
undressed
the
maid
sniveled
a
request
to
be
allowed
to
remain
with
her
mistress
she
would
lie
on
a
couch
until
morning
two
staterooms
had
been
converted
into
one
to
provide
miss
deane
with
ample
accommodation
there
were
no
bunks
but
a
cozy
bed
was
screwed
to
the
deck
she
lay
down
and
strove
to
read
it
was
a
difficult
task
her
eyes
wandered
from
the
printed
page
to
mark
the
absurd
antics
of
her
garments
swinging
on
their
hooks
at
times
the
ship
rolled
so
far
that
she
felt
sure
it
must
topple
over
she
was
not
afraid
but
subdued
rather
astonished
placidly
prepared
for
vague
eventualities
through
it
all
she
wondered
why
she
clung
to
the
belief
that
in
another
day
or
two
the
storm
would
be
forgotten
and
people
playing
quoits
on
deck
dancing
singing
coon
songs
in
the
or
grumbling
at
the
heat
things
were
ridiculous
what
need
was
there
for
all
this
external
fury
why
should
poor
sailors
be
cast
forth
to
instant
death
in
such
awful
manner
if
she
could
only
sleep
and
forget
if
kind
oblivion
would
blot
out
the
storm
for
a
few
blissful
hours
but
how
could
one
sleep
with
the
consciousness
of
that
watery
giant
thundering
his
summons
upon
the
iron
plates
a
few
inches
away
then
came
the
blurred
picture
of
captain
ross
high
up
on
the
bridge
peering
into
the
moving
blackness
how
strange
that
there
should
be
hidden
in
the
convolutions
of
a
man
brain
an
intelligence
that
laid
bare
the
pretences
of
that
ravenous
demon
without
each
of
the
officers
the
commander
more
than
the
others
understood
the
why
and
the
wherefore
of
this
blustering
combination
of
wind
and
sea
iris
knew
the
language
of
poker
nature
was
putting
up
a
huge
bluff
what
was
it
the
captain
said
in
his
little
lecture
when
a
ship
meets
a
cyclone
north
of
the
equator
on
a
westerly
course
she
nearly
always
has
the
wind
at
first
on
the
port
side
but
owing
to
the
revolution
of
the
gale
when
she
passes
its
center
the
wind
is
on
the
starboard
side
yes
that
was
right
as
far
as
the
first
part
was
concerned
evidently
they
had
not
yet
passed
the
central
path
oh
dear
she
was
so
tired
it
demanded
a
physical
effort
to
constantly
shove
away
an
unseen
force
that
tried
to
push
you
over
how
funny
that
a
big
cloud
should
travel
up
against
the
wind
and
so
amidst
confused
wonderment
she
lapsed
into
an
uneasy
slumber
her
last
sentient
thought
being
a
quiet
thankfulness
that
the
screw
went
with
such
firm
determination
after
the
course
was
changed
and
the
bore
away
towards
the
the
commander
consulted
the
barometer
each
the
mercury
had
sunk
over
two
inches
in
twelve
hours
the
abnormally
low
pressure
quickly
created
dense
clouds
which
enhanced
the
melancholy
darkness
of
the
gale
for
many
minutes
together
the
bows
of
the
ship
were
not
visible
masthead
and
sidelights
were
obscured
by
the
pelting
scud
the
engines
thrust
the
vessel
forward
like
a
lance
into
the
vitals
of
the
storm
wind
and
wave
gushed
out
of
the
vortex
with
impotent
fury
at
last
soon
after
midnight
the
barometer
showed
a
slight
upward
movement
at
the
change
became
pronounced
simultaneously
the
wind
swung
round
a
point
to
the
westward
then
captain
ross
smiled
wearily
his
face
brightened
he
opened
his
oilskin
coat
glanced
at
the
compass
and
nodded
approval
that
right
he
shouted
to
the
quartermaster
at
the
keep
her
steady
there
south
west
south
west
it
is
sir
yelled
the
sailor
impassively
watching
the
moving
disk
for
the
wind
alteration
necessitated
a
little
less
help
from
the
rudder
to
keep
the
ship
head
true
to
her
course
captain
ross
ate
some
sandwiches
and
washed
them
down
with
cold
tea
he
was
more
hungry
than
he
imagined
having
spent
eleven
hours
without
food
the
tea
was
insipid
he
called
through
a
for
a
further
supply
of
sandwiches
and
some
coffee
then
he
turned
to
consult
a
chart
he
was
joined
by
the
chief
officer
both
men
examined
the
chart
in
silence
captain
ross
finally
took
a
pencil
he
stabbed
its
point
on
the
paper
in
the
neighborhood
of
and
we
are
about
there
i
think
the
chief
agreed
that
was
the
locality
i
had
in
my
mind
he
bent
closer
over
the
sheet
nothing
in
the
way
tonight
sir
he
added
nothing
whatever
it
is
a
bit
of
good
luck
to
meet
such
weather
here
we
can
keep
as
far
south
as
we
like
until
daybreak
and
by
that
time
how
did
it
look
when
you
came
in
a
trifle
better
i
think
i
have
sent
for
some
refreshments
let
us
have
another
footnote
hindustani
for
look
word
much
used
by
sailors
in
the
east
before
we
tackle
them
the
two
officers
passed
out
into
the
hurricane
instantly
the
wind
endeavored
to
tear
the
charthouse
from
off
the
deck
they
looked
aloft
and
ahead
the
officer
on
duty
saw
them
and
nodded
silent
comprehension
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
speak
the
weather
was
perceptibly
clearer
then
all
three
peered
ahead
again
they
stood
pressing
against
the
wind
seeking
to
penetrate
the
murkiness
in
front
suddenly
they
were
galvanized
into
strenuous
activity
a
wild
howl
came
from
the
lookout
forward
the
eyes
of
the
three
men
glared
at
a
huge
dismasted
chinese
junk
wallowing
helplessly
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
dead
under
the
bows
the
captain
sprang
to
the
charthouse
and
signaled
in
fierce
pantomime
that
the
wheel
should
be
put
hard
over
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
bridge
pressed
the
telegraph
lever
to
stop
and
full
speed
astern
whilst
with
his
disengaged
hand
he
pulled
hard
at
the
siren
cord
and
a
raucous
warning
sent
stewards
flying
through
the
ship
to
close
collision
bulkhead
doors
the
chief
darted
to
the
port
rail
for
the
instant
response
to
the
helm
seemed
to
clear
her
nose
from
the
junk
as
if
by
magic
it
all
happened
so
quickly
that
whilst
the
hoarse
signal
was
still
vibrating
through
the
ship
the
junk
swept
past
her
quarter
the
chief
officer
joined
now
by
the
commander
looked
down
into
the
wretched
craft
they
could
see
her
crew
lashed
in
a
bunch
around
the
capstan
on
her
elevated
poop
she
was
laden
with
timber
although
she
could
not
sink
if
she
held
together
a
great
wave
sucked
her
away
from
the
steamer
and
then
hurled
her
back
with
irresistible
force
the
was
just
completing
her
turning
movement
and
she
heeled
over
yielding
to
the
mighty
power
of
the
gale
for
an
appreciable
instant
her
engines
stopped
the
mass
of
water
that
swayed
the
junk
like
a
cork
lifted
the
great
ship
high
by
the
stern
the
propeller
began
to
revolve
in
air
for
the
third
officer
had
corrected
his
signal
to
full
speed
ahead
again
and
the
cumbrous
chinese
vessel
struck
the
a
terrible
blow
in
the
counter
smashing
off
the
screw
close
to
the
and
wrenching
the
rudder
from
its
bearings
there
was
an
awful
race
by
the
engines
before
the
engineers
could
shut
off
steam
the
junk
vanished
into
the
wilderness
of
noise
and
tumbling
seas
beyond
and
the
fine
steamer
of
a
few
seconds
ago
replete
with
magnificent
energy
struggled
like
a
wounded
leviathan
in
the
grasp
of
a
vengeful
foe
she
swung
round
as
if
in
wrath
to
pursue
the
puny
assailant
which
had
dealt
her
this
mortal
stroke
no
longer
breasting
the
storm
with
stubborn
persistency
she
now
drifted
aimlessly
before
wind
and
wave
she
was
merely
a
larger
plaything
tossed

the
junk
was
burst
asunder
by
the
collision
her
planks
and
cargo
littered
the

were

tossed
in
derision
on
to
the
decks
of
the

was
strong

or
bolted
iron
against
the
spleen
of
the
unchained
and
formless
monster
who
loudly
proclaimed
his
triumph
the
great
steamship
drifted
on
through
chaos
the
typhoon
had
broken
the
lance
but
brave
men
skilfully
directed
wrought
hard
to
avert
further
disaster
after
the
first
moment
of
stupor
gallant
british
sailors
risked
life
and
limb
to
bring
the
vessel
under
control
by
their
calm
courage
they
shamed
the
paralyzed
lascars
into
activity
a
sail
was
rigged
on
the
foremast
and
a
sea
anchor
hastily
constructed
as
soon
as
it
was
discovered
that
the
helm
was
useless
rockets
flared
up
into
the
sky
at
regular
intervals
in
the
faint

that
should
they
attract
the
attention
of
another
vessel
she
would
follow
the
disabled
and
render
help
when
the
weather
moderated
when
the
captain
ascertained
that
no
water
was
being
shipped
the
damage
being
wholly
external
the
collision
doors
were
opened
and
the
passengers
admitted
to
the
saloon
a
brilliant
palace
superbly
indifferent
to
the
wreck
and
ruin
without
captain
ross
himself
came
down
and
addressed
a
few
comforting
words
to
the
quiet
men
and
pallid
women
gathered
there
he
told
them
exactly
what
had
happened
sir
john
tozer
and
critical
asked
a
question
the
junk
is
destroyed
i
assume
he
said
it
is
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
have
struck
her
end
on
much
better
but
that
is
not
the
view
we
should
take
if
we
encountered
a
vessel
relatively
as
big
as
the
was
to
the
unfortunate
junk
but
persisted
the
lawyer
what
would
have
been
the
result
you
would
never
have
known
that
the
incident
had
happened
sir
john
in
other
words
the
poor
despairing
chinamen
clinging
to
their
little
craft
with
some
chance
of
escape
would
be
quietly
murdered
to
suit
our
convenience
it
was
iris
clear
voice
that
rang
out
this
downright
exposition
of
the
facts
sir
john
shook
his
head
he
carried
the
discussion
no
further
the
hours
passed
in
tedious
misery
after
captain
ross
visit
every
one
was
eager
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
unknown
terrors
without
from
the
deck
this
was
out
of
the
question
so
people
sat
around
the
tables
to
listen
eagerly
to
experience
and
his
wise
saws
on
drifting
ships
and
their
prospects
some
cautious
persons
visited
their
cabins
to
secure
valuables
in
case
of
further
disaster
a
few
hardy
spirits
returned
to
bed
meanwhile
in
the
charthouse
the
captain
and
chief
officer
were
gravely
pondering
over
an
open
chart
and
discussing
a
fresh
risk
that
loomed
ominously
before
them
the
ship
was
a
long
way
out
of
her
usual
course
when
the
accident
happened
she
was
drifting
now
they
estimated
eleven
knots
an
hour
with
wind
sea
and
current
all
forcing
her
in
the
same
direction
drifting
into
one
of
the
most
dangerous
places
in
the
known
world
the
south
china
sea
with
its
numberless
reefs
shoals
and
isolated
rocks
and
the
great
island
of
borneo
stretching
right
across
the
path
of
the
cyclone
still
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
save
to
make
a
few
unobtrusive
preparations
and
trust
to
idle
chance
to
attempt
to
anchor
and
ride
out
the
gale
in
their
present
position
was
out
of
the

swept

there
was
only
left
the

captain
ross
entered
the
charthouse
for
the
twentieth
time
he
had
aged
many
years
in
appearance
the
smiling
confident
debonair
officer
was
changed
into
a
stricken
mournful
man
he
had
altered
with
his
ship
the
and
her
master
could
hardly
be
recognized
so
cruel
were
the
blows
they
had
received
it
is
impossible
to
see
a
yard
ahead
he
confided
to
his
second
in
command
i
have
never
been
so
anxious
before
in
my
life
thank
god
the
night
is
drawing
to
a
close
perhaps
when
day
breaks
his
last
words
contained
a
prayer
and
a
hope
even
as
he
spoke
the
ship
seemed
to
lift
herself
bodily
with
an
unusual
effort
for
a
vessel
moving
before
the
wind
the
next
instant
there
was
a
horrible
grinding
crash
forward
each
person
who
did
not
chance
to
be
holding
fast
to
an
upright
was
thrown
violently
down
the
deck
was
tilted
to
a
dangerous
angle
and
remained
there
whilst
the
heavy
buffeting
of
the
sea
now
raging
afresh
at
this
resistance
drowned
the
despairing
yells
raised
by
the
lascars
on
duty
the
had
completed
her
last
voyage
she
was
now
a
battered
wreck
on
a
barrier
reef
she
hung
thus
for
one
second
then
another
wave
riding
triumphantly
through
its
fellows
caught
the
great
steamer
in
its
tremendous
grasp
carried
her
onward
for
half
her
length
and
smashed
her
down
on
the
rocks
her
back
was
broken
she
parted
in
two
halves
both
sections
turned
completely
over
in
the
utter
wantonness
of
destruction
and
everything
masts
funnels
boats

with
every
living
soul
on

was
at
once
engulfed
in
a
maelstrom

rushing

and
spray
chapter

the
survivors
when
the
parted
amidships
the
floor
of
the
saloon
heaved
up
in
the
center
with
a
mighty
crash
of
rending
woodwork
and
iron
men
and
women
too
stupefied
to
sob
out
a
prayer
were
pitched
headlong
into
chaos
iris
torn
from
the
terrified
grasp
of
her
maid
fell
through
a
corridor
and
would
have
gone
down
with
the
ship
had
not
a
sailor
clinging
to
a
companion
ladder
caught
her
as
she
whirled
along
the
steep
slope
of
the
deck
he
did
not
know
what
had
happened
with
the
instinct
of
he
seized
the
nearest
support
when
the
vessel
struck
it
was
the
mere
impulse
of
ready
helpfulness
that
caused
him
to
stretch
out
his
left
arm
and
clasp
the
girl
waist
as
she
fluttered
past
by
idle
chance
they
were
on
the
port
side
and
the
ship
after
pausing
for
one
awful
second
fell
over
to
starboard
the
man
was
not
prepared
for
this
second
gyration
even
as
the
stairway
canted
he
lost
his
balance
they
were
both
thrown
violently
through
the
open
hatchway
and
swept
off
into
the
boiling
surf
under
such
conditions
thought
itself
was
impossible
a
series
of
impressions
a
number
of
fantastic
pictures
were
received
by
the
benumbed
faculties
and
afterwards
painfully
sorted
out
by
the
memory
fear
anguish
amazement
none
of
these
could
exist
all
he
knew
was
that
the
lifeless
form
of
a
woman
for
iris
had
happily
fainted
must
be
held
until
death
itself
wrenched
her
from
him
then
there
came
the
headlong
plunge
into
the
swirling
sea
followed
by
an
indefinite
period
of
gasping
oblivion
something
that
felt
like
a
moving
rock
rose
up
beneath
his
feet
he
was
driven
clear
out
of
the
water
and
seemed
to
recognize
a
familiar
object
rising
rigid
and
bright
close
at
hand
it
was
the
binnacle
pillar
screwed
to
a
portion
of
the
deck
which
came
away
from
the
charthouse
and
was
rent
from
the
upper
framework
by
contact
with
the
reef
he
seized
this
support
with
his
disengaged
hand
for
one
fleet
instant
he
had
a
confused
vision
of
the
destruction
of
the
ship
both
the
fore
and
aft
portions
were
burst
asunder
by
the
force
of
compressed
air
wreckage
and
human
forms
were
tossing
about
foolishly
the
sea
pounded
upon
the
opposing
rocks
with
the
noise
of
ten
thousand
mighty
a
uniformed
figure
he
thought
it
was
the
captain
stretched
out
an
unavailing
arm
to
clasp
the
queer
raft
which
supported
the
sailor
and
the
girl
but
a
jealous
wave
rose
under
the
platform
with
devilish
energy
and
turned
it
completely
over
hurling
the
man
with
his
inanimate
burthen
into
the
depths
he
rose
fighting
madly
for
his
life
now
surely
he
was
doomed
but
again
as
if
human
existence
depended
on
naught
more
serious
than
the
spinning
of
a
coin
his
knees
rested
on
the
same
few
staunch
timbers
now
the
ceiling
of
the
and
he
was
given
a
brief
respite
his
greatest
difficulty
was
to
get
his
breath
so
dense
was
the
spray
through
which
he
was
driven
even
in
that
terrible
moment
he
kept
his
senses
the
girl
utterly
unconscious
showed
by
the
convulsive
heaving
of
her
breast
that
she
was
choking
with
a
wild
effort
he
swung
her
head
round
to
shield
her
from
the
flying
scud
with
his
own
form
the
tiny
thus
provided
gave
her
some
relief
and
in
that
instant
the
sailor
seemed
to
recognize
her
he
was
not
remotely
capable
of
a
definite
idea
just
as
he
vaguely
realized
the
identity
of
the
woman
in
his
arms
the
unsteady
support
on
which
he
rested
toppled
over
again
he
renewed
the
unequal
contest
a
strong
resolute
man
and
a
typhoon
sea
wrestled
for
supremacy
this
time
his
feet
plunged
against
something
gratefully
solid
he
was
dashed
forward
still
battling
with
the
raging
turmoil
of
water
and
a
second
time
he
felt
the
same
firm
yet
smooth
surface
his
dormant
faculties
awoke
it
was
sand
with
frenzied
desperation
buoyed
now
by
the
inspiring
hope
of
safety
he
fought
his
way
onwards
like
a
maniac
often
he
fell
three
times
did
the
backwash
try
to
drag
him
to
the
swirling
death
behind
but
he
staggered
blindly
on
on
until
even
the
tearing
gale
ceased
to
be
laden
with
the
suffocating
foam
and
his
faltering
feet
sank
in
deep
soft
white
sand
illustration
with
frenzied
desperation
buoyed
now
by
the
inspiring
hope
of
safety
he
fought
his
way
onward
like
a
maniac
then
he
fell
not
to
rise
again
with
a
last
weak
flicker
of
exhausted
strength
he
drew
the
girl
closely
to
him
and
the
two
lay
clasped
tightly
together
heedless
now
of
all
things
how
long
the
man
remained
prostrate
he
could
only
guess
subsequently
the
struck
soon
after
daybreak
and
the
sailor
awoke
to
a
hazy
consciousness
of
his
surroundings
to
find
a
shaft
of
sunshine
flickering
through
the
clouds
banked
up
in
the
east
the
gale
was
already
passing
away
although
the
wind
still
whistled
with
shrill
violence
it
was
more
blustering
than
threatening
the
sea
too
though
running
very
high
had
retreated
many
yards
from
the
spot
where
he
had
finally
dropped
and
its
surface
was
no
longer
scourged
with
venomous
spray
slowly
and
painfully
he
raised
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
for
he
was
bruised
and
stiff
with
his
first
movement
he
became
violently
ill
he
had
swallowed
much
salt
water
and
it
was
not
until
the
spasm
of
sickness
had
passed
that
he
thought
of
the
girl
she
had
slipped
from
his
breast
as
he
rose
and
was
lying
face
downwards
in
the
sand
the
memory
of
much
that
had
happened
surged
into
his
brain
with
horrifying
suddenness
she
can
not
be
dead
he
hoarsely
murmured
feebly
trying
to
lift
her
surely
providence
would
not
desert
her
after
such
an
escape
what
a
weak
beggar
i
must
be
to
give
in
at
the
last
moment
i
am
sure
she
was
living
when
we
got
ashore
what
on
earth
can
i
do
to
revive
her
forgetful
of
his
own
aching
limbs
in
this
newborn
anxiety
he
sank
on
one
knee
and
gently
pillowed
iris
head
and
shoulders
on
the
other
her
eyes
were
closed
her
lips
and
teeth
firmly
set
a
fact
to
which
she
undoubtedly
owed
her
life
else
she
would
have
been
suffocated
and
the
pallor
of
her
skin
seemed
to
be
that
terrible
bloodless
hue
which
indicates
death
the
stern
lines
in
the
man
face
relaxed
and
something
blurred
his
vision
he
was
weak
from
exhaustion
and
want
of
food
for
the
moment
his
emotions
were
easily
aroused
oh
it
is
pitiful
he
almost
whimpered
it
can
not
be
with
a
gesture
of
despair
he
drew
the
sleeve
of
his
thick
jersey
across
his
eyes
to
clear
them
from
the
gathering
mist
then
he
tremblingly
endeavored
to
open
the
neck
of
her
dress
and
unclasp
her
corsets
he
had
a
vague
notion
that
ladies
in
a
fainting
condition
required
such
treatment
and
he
was
desperately
resolved
to
bring
iris
deane
back
to
conscious
existence
if
it
were
possible
his
task
was
rendered
difficult
by
the
waistband
of
her
dress
he
slipped
out
a
and
opened
the
blade
not
until
then
did
he
discover
that
the
nail
of
the
forefinger
on
his
right
hand
had
been
torn
out
by
the
quick
probably
during
his
endeavors
to
grasp
the
unsteady
support
which
contributed
so
materially
to
his
escape
it
still
hung
by
a
shred
and
hindered
the
free
use
of
his
hand
without
any
hesitation
he
seized
the
offending
nail
in
his
teeth
and
completed
the
surgical
operation
by
a
rapid
jerk
bending
to
resume
his
task
he
was
startled
to
find
the
girl
eyes
wide
open
and
surveying
him
with
shadowy
alarm
she
was
quite
conscious
absurdly
so
in
a
sense
and
had
noticed
his
strange
action
thank
god
he
cried
hoarsely
you
are
alive
her
mind
as
yet
could
only
work
in
a
single
groove
why
did
you
do
that
she
whispered
do
what
bite
your
nail
off
it
was
in
my
way
i
wished
to
cut
open
your
dress
at
the
waist
you
were
collapsed
almost
dead
i
thought
and
i
wanted
to
unfasten
your
corsets
her
color
came
back
with
remarkable
rapidity
from
all
the
rich
variety
of
the
english
tongue
few
words
could
have
been
selected
of
such
restorative
effect
she
tried
to
assume
a
sitting
posture
and
instinctively
her
hands
traveled
to
her
disarranged
costume
how
ridiculous
she
said
with
a
little
note
of
annoyance
in
her
voice
which
sounded
curiously
hollow
but
her
brave
spirit
could
not
yet
command
her
enfeebled
frame
she
was
perforce
compelled
to
sink
back
to
the
support
of
his
knee
and
arm
do
you
think
you
could
lie
quiet
until
i
try
to
find
some
water
he
gasped
anxiously
she
nodded
a
childlike
acquiescence
and
her
eyelids
fell
it
was
only
that
her
eyes
smarted
dreadfully
from
the
salt
water
but
the
sailor
was
sure
that
this
was
a
premonition
of
a
lapse
to
unconsciousness
please
try
not
to
faint
again
he
said
do
you
think
i
had
better
loosen
these
things
you
can
breathe
more
easily
a
ghost
of
a
smile
flickered
on
her
lips
no
no
she
murmured
my
eyes
hurt
me
that
is
all
is
there
any
water
he
laid
her
tenderly
on
the
sand
and
rose
to
his
feet
his
first
glance
was
towards
the
sea
he
saw
something
which
made
him
blink
with
astonishment
a
heavy
sea
was
still
running
over
the
barrier
reef
which
enclosed
a
small
lagoon
the
contrast
between
the
fierce
commotion
outside
and
the
comparatively
smooth
surface
of
the
protected
pool
was
very
marked
at
low
tide
the
lagoon
was
almost
completely
isolated
indeed
he
imagined
that
only
a
fierce
gale
blowing
from
the
would
enable
the
waves
to
leap
the
reef
save
where
a
strip
of
broken
water
surging
far
into
the
small
natural
harbor
betrayed
the
position
of
the
tiny
entrance
yet
at
this
very
point
a
fine
cocoanut
palm
reared
its
stately
column
high
in
air
and
its
long
tremulous
fronds
were
now
swinging
wildly
before
the
gale
from
where
he
stood
it
appeared
to
be
growing
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
for
huge
breakers
completely
hid
the
coral
embankment
this
sentinel
of
the
land
had
a
weirdly
impressive
effect
it
was
the
only
fixed
object
in
the
waste
of
waves
not
a
vestige
of
the
remained
seaward
but
the
sand
was
littered
with
wreckage
and
mournful
spectacle
a
considerable
number
of
inanimate
human
forms
lay
huddled
up
amidst
the
relics
of
the
steamer
this
discovery
stirred
him
to
action
he
turned
to
survey
the
land
on
which
he
was
stranded
with
his
helpless
companion
to
his
great
relief
he
discovered
that
it
was
lofty
and
he
knew
that
the
ship
could
not
have
drifted
to
borneo
which
still
lay
far
to
the
south
this
must
be
one
of
the
hundreds
of
islands
which
stud
the
china
sea
and
provide
resorts
for
haïnan
fishermen
probably
it
was
inhabited
though
he
thought
it
strange
that
none
of
the
islanders
had
put
in
an
appearance
in
any
event
water
and
food
of
some
sort
were
assured
but
before
setting
out
upon
his
quest
two
things
demanded
attention
the
girl
must
be
removed
from
her
present
position
it
would
be
too
horrible
to
permit
her
first
conscious
gaze
to
rest
upon
those
crumpled
objects
on
the
beach
common
humanity
demanded
too
that
he
should
hastily
examine
each
of
the
bodies
in
case
life
was
not
wholly
extinct
so
he
bent
over
the
girl
noting
with
sudden
wonder
that
weak
as
she
was
she
had
managed
to
refasten
part
of
her
bodice
you
must
permit
me
to
carry
you
a
little
further
inland
he
explained
gently
without
another
word
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
marveling
somewhat
at
the
strength
which
came
of
necessity
and
bore
her
some
little
distance
until
a
sturdy
rock
jutting
out
of
the
sand
offered
shelter
from
the
wind
and
protection
from
the
sea
and
its
revelations
i
am
so
cold
and
tired
murmured
iris
is
there
any
water
my
throat
hurts
me
he
pressed
back
the
tangled
hair
from
her
forehead
as
he
might
soothe
a
child
try
to
lie
still
for
a
very
few
minutes
he
said
you
have
not
long
to
suffer
i
will
return
immediately
his
own
throat
and
palate
were
on
fire
owing
to
the
brine
but
he
first
hurried
back
to
the
edge
of
the
lagoon
there
were
fourteen
bodies
in
all
three
women
and
eleven
men
four
of
the
latter
being
lascars
the
women
were
saloon
passengers
whom
he
did
not
know
one
of
the
men
was
the
surgeon
another
the
first
officer
a
third
sir
john
tozer
the
rest
were
passengers
and
members
of
the
crew
they
were
all
dead
some
had
been
peacefully
drowned
others
were
fearfully
mangled
by
the
rocks
two
of
the
lascars
bearing
signs
of
dreadful
injuries
were
lying
on
a
cluster
of
low
rocks
overhanging
the
water
the
remainder
rested
on
the
sand
the
sailor
exhibited
no
visible
emotion
whilst
he
conducted
his
sad
scrutiny
when
he
was
assured
that
this
silent
company
was
beyond
mortal
help
he
at
once
strode
away
towards
the
nearest
belt
of
trees
he
could
not
tell
how
long
the
search
for
water
might
be
protracted
and
there
was
pressing
need
for
it
when
he
reached
the
first
clump
of
brushwood
he
uttered
a
delighted
exclamation
there
growing
in
prodigal
luxuriance
was
the
beneficent
whose
large
leaf
shaped
like
a
teacup
not
only
holds
a
lasting
quantity
of
but
mixes
therewith
its
own
palatable
and
natural
juices
with
his
knife
he
severed
two
of
the
leaves
swearing
emphatically
the
while
on
account
of
his
damaged
finger
and
hastened
to
iris
with
the
precious
beverage
she
heard
him
and
managed
to
raise
herself
on
an
elbow
the
poor
girl
eyes
glistened
at
the
prospect
of
relief
without
a
word
of
question
or
surprise
she
swallowed
the
contents
of
both
leaves
then
she
found
utterance
how
odd
it
tastes
what
is
it
she
inquired
but
the
eagerness
with
which
she
quenched
her
thirst
renewed
his
own
momentarily
forgotten
torture
his
tongue
seemed
to
swell
he
was
absolutely
unable
to
reply
the
water
revived
iris
like
a
magic
draught
her
quick
intuition
told
her
what
had
happened
you
have
had
none
yourself
she
cried
go
at
once
and
get
some
and
please
bring
me
some
more
he
required
no
second
bidding
after
hastily
gulping
down
the
contents
of
several
leaves
he
returned
with
a
further
supply
iris
was
now
sitting
up
the
sun
had
burst
royally
through
the
clouds
and
her
chilled
limbs
were
gaining
some
degree
of
warmth
and
elasticity
what
is
it
she
repeated
after
another
delicious
draught
the
leaf
of
the
nature
is
not
always
cruel
in
an
unusually
generous
mood
she
devised
this
method
of
storing
water
miss
deane
reached
out
her
hand
for
more
her
troubled
brain
refused
to
wonder
at
such
a
reply
from
an
ordinary
seaman
the
sailor
deliberately
spilled
the
contents
of
a
remaining
leaf
on
the
sand
no
madam
he
said
with
an
odd
mixture
of
deference
and
firmness
no
more
at
present
i
must
first
procure
you
some
food
she
looked
up
at
him
in
momentary
silence
the
ship
is
lost
she
said
after
a
pause
yes
madam
are
we
the
only
people
saved
i
fear
so
is
this
a
desert
island
i
think
not
madam
it
may
by
chance
be
temporarily
uninhabited
but
fishermen
from
china
come
to
all
these
places
to
collect
and
i
have
seen
no
other
living
beings
except
ourselves
nevertheless
the
islanders
may
live
on
the
south
side
another
pause
amidst
the
thrilling
sensations
of
the
moment
iris
found
herself
idly
speculating
as
to
the
meaning
of
and
why
this
common
sailor
pronounced
french
so
well
her
thoughts
reverted
to
the
steamer
it
surely
can
not
be
possible
that
the
has
gone
to
pieces
a
magnificent
vessel
of
her
size
and
strength
he
answered
quietly
it
is
too
true
madam
i
suppose
you
hardly
knew
she
struck
it
happened
so
suddenly
afterwards
fortunately
for
you
you
were
unconscious
how
do
you
know
she
inquired
quickly
a
flood
of
vivid
recollection
was
pouring
in
upon
her
i
er
well
i
happened
to
be
near
you
madam
when
the
ship
broke
up
and
we
er
drifted
ashore
together
she
rose
and
faced
him
i
remember
now
she
cried
hysterically
you
caught
me
as
i
was
thrown
into
the
corridor
we
fell
into
the
sea
when
the
vessel
turned
over
you
have
saved
my
life
were
it
not
for
you
i
could
not
possibly
have
escaped
she
gazed
at
him
more
earnestly
seeing
that
he
blushed
beneath
the
crust
of
salt
and
sand
that
covered
his
face
why
she
went
on
with
growing
excitement
you
are
the
steward
i
noticed
in
the
saloon
yesterday
how
is
it
that
you
are
now
dressed
as
a
sailor
he
answered
readily
enough
there
was
an
accident
on
board
during
the
gale
madam
i
am
a
fair
sailor
but
a
poor
steward
so
i
applied
for
a
transfer
as
the
crew
were
my
offer
was
accepted
iris
was
now
looking
at
him
intently
you
saved
my
life
she
repeated
slowly
it
seemed
that
this
obvious
fact
needed
to
be
indelibly
established
in
her
mind
indeed
the
girl
was
overwrought
by
all
that
she
had
gone
through
only
by
degrees
were
her
thoughts
marshaling
themselves
with
lucid
coherence
as
yet
she
recalled
so
many
dramatic
incidents
that
they
failed
to
assume
due
proportion
but
quickly
there
came
memories
of
captain
ross
of
sir
john
and
lady
tozer
of
the
doctor
her
maid
the
hundred
and
one
individualities
of
her
pleasant
life
aboard
ship
could
it
be
that
they
were
all
dead
the
notion
was
monstrous
but
its
ghastly
significance
was
instantly
borne
in
upon
her
by
the
plight
in
which
she
stood
her
lips
quivered
the
tears
trembled
in
her
eyes
is
it
really
true
that
all
the
ship
company
except
ourselves
are
lost
she
brokenly
demanded
the
sailor
gravely
earnest
glance
fell
before
hers
unhappily
there
is
no
room
for
doubt
he
said
are
you
quite
quite
sure
i
am
sure
of
some
involuntarily
he
turned
seawards
she
understood
him
she
sank
to
her
knees
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
broke
into
a
passion
of
weeping
with
a
look
of
infinite
pity
he
stooped
and
would
have
touched
her
shoulder
but
he
suddenly
restrained
the
impulse
something
had
hardened
this
man
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
be
callous
but
he
succeeded
his
mouth
tightened
and
his
expression
lost
its
tenderness
come
come
my
dear
lady
he
exclaimed
and
there
was
a
tinge
of
studied
roughness
in
his
voice
you
must
calm
yourself
it
is
the
fortune
of
shipwreck
as
well
as
of
war
you
know
we
are
alive
and
must
look
after
ourselves
those
who
have
gone
are
beyond
our
help
but
not
beyond
our
sympathy
wailed
iris
uncovering
her
swimming
eyes
for
a
fleeting
look
at
him
even
in
the
utter
desolation
of
the
moment
she
could
not
help
marveling
that
this
sailor
who
spoke
like
a
gentleman
and
tried
to
pose
as
her
inferior
who
had
rescued
her
with
the
utmost
gallantry
who
carried
his
quixotic
zeal
to
the
point
of
first
supplying
her
needs
when
he
was
in
far
worse
case
himself
should
be
so
utterly
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
others
he
waited
silently
until
her
sobs
ceased
now
madam
he
said
it
is
essential
that
we
should
obtain
some
food
i
do
wish
to
leave
you
alone
until
we
are
better
acquainted
with
our
whereabouts
can
you
walk
a
little
way
towards
the
trees
or
shall
i
assist
you
iris
immediately
stood
up
she
pressed
her
hair
back
defiantly
certainly
i
can
walk
she
answered
what
do
you
propose
to
do
well
madam
what
is
your
name
she
interrupted
imperiously
jenks
madam
robert
jenks
thank
you
now
listen
robert
jenks
my
name
is
miss
iris
deane
on
board
ship
i
was
a
passenger
and
you
were
a
steward
that
is
until
you
became
a
seaman
here
we
are
equals
in
misfortune
but
in
all
else
you
are
the
leader
i
am
quite
useless
i
can
only
help
in
matters
by
your
direction
so
i
do
not
wish
to
be
addressed
as
in
every
breath
do
you
understand
me
conscious
that
her
large
blue
eyes
were
fixed
indignantly
upon
him
robert
jenks
repressed
a
smile
she
was
still
hysterical
and
must
be
humored
in
her
vagaries
what
an
odd
moment
for
a
discussion
on
etiquette
as
you
wish
miss
deane
he
said
the
fact
remains
that
i
have
many
things
to
attend
to
and
we
really
must
eat
something
what
can
we
eat
let
us
find
out
he
replied
scanning
the
nearest
trees
with
keen
scrutiny
they
plodded
together
through
the
sand
in
silence
physically
they
were
a
superb
couple
but
in
raiment
they
resembled
scarecrows
both
of
course
were
the
sailor
jersey
and
trousers
were
old
and
torn
and
the
still
soughed
loudly
in
his
heavy
boots
with
each
step
but
iris
was
in
a
deplorable
plight
her
hair
fell
in
a
great
wave
of
golden
brown
strands
over
her
neck
and
shoulders
every
hairpin
had
vanished
but
with
a
few
dexterous
twists
she
coiled
the
flying
tresses
into
a
loose
knot
her
beautiful
muslin
dress
was
rent
and
draggled
it
was
drying
rapidly
under
the
power
of
the
sun
and
she
surreptitiously
endeavored
to
complete
the
fastening
of
the
open
portion
about
her
neck
other
details
must
be
left
until
a
more
favorable
opportunity
she
recalled
the
strange
sight
that
first
met
her
eyes
when
she
recovered
consciousness
you
hurt
your
finger
she
said
abruptly
let
me
see
it
they
had
reached
the
shelter
of
the
trees
pleasantly
grateful
now
so
powerful
are
tropical
sunbeams
at
even
an
early
hour
he
held
out
his
right
hand
without
looking
at
her
indeed
his
eyes
had
been
studiously
averted
during
the
past
few
minutes
her
womanly
feelings
were
aroused
by
the
condition
of
the
ragged
wound
oh
you
poor
fellow
she
said
how
awful
it
must
be
how
did
it
happen
let
me
tie
it
up
it
is
not
so
bad
now
he
said
it
has
been
well
soaked
in
salt
water
you
know
i
think
the
nail
was
torn
off
when
we
when
a
piece
of
wreckage
miraculously
turned
up
beneath
us
iris
shredded
a
strip
from
her
dress
she
bound
the
finger
with
deft
tenderness
thank
you
he
said
simply
then
he
gave
a
glad
shout
by
jove
miss
deane
we
are
in
luck
way
there
is
a
fine
plantain
tree
the
pangs
of
hunger
could
not
be
resisted
although
the
fruit
was
hardly
ripe
they
tore
at
the
great
bunches
and
ate
ravenously
iris
made
no
pretence
in
the
matter
and
the
sailor
was
in
worse
plight
for
he
had
been
on
duty
continuously
since
four
the
previous
afternoon
at
last
their
appetite
was
somewhat
appeased
though
plantains
might
not
appeal
to
a
gourmand
as
the
solitary
joint
now
decided
jenks
you
must
rest
here
a
little
while
miss
deane
i
am
going
back
to
the
beach
you
need
not
be
afraid
there
are
no
animals
to
harm
you
and
i
will
not
be
far
away
what
are
you
going
to
do
on
the
beach
she
demanded
to
rescue
stores
for
the
most
part
may
i
not
come
with
you
i
can
be
of
some
little
service
surely
he
answered
slowly
please
oblige
me
by
remaining
here
at
present
in
less
than
an
hour
i
will
return
and
then
perhaps
you
will
find
plenty
to
do
she
read
his
meaning
intuitively
and
shivered
i
could
not
do
she
murmured
i
would
faint
whilst
you
are
away
i
will
pray
for
them
my
unfortunate
friends
as
he
passed
from
her
side
he
heard
her
sobbing
quietly
when
he
reached
the
lagoon
he
halted
suddenly
something
startled
him
he
was
quite
certain
that
he
had
counted
fourteen
corpses
now
there
were
only
twelve
the
two
lascars
bodies
which
rested
on
the
small
group
of
rocks
on
the
verge
of
the
lagoon
had
vanished
where
had
they
gone
to
chapter
iii
discoveries
the
sailor
wasted
no
time
in
idle
bewilderment
he
searched
carefully
for
traces
of
the
missing
lascars
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
bodies
had
been
dragged
from
off
the
rocks
into
the
lagoon
by
some
agency
the
nature
of
which
he
could
not
even
conjecture
they
were
lying
many
feet
above
the
when
he
last
saw
them
little
more
than
half
an
hour
earlier
at
that
point
the
beach
shelved
rapidly
he
could
look
far
into
the
depths
of
the
rapidly
clearing
water
nothing
was
visible
there
save
several
varieties
of
small
fish
the
incident
puzzled
and
annoyed
him
still
thinking
about
it
he
sat
down
on
the
highest
rock
and
pulled
off
his
heavy
boots
to
empty
the
water
out
he
also
divested
himself
of
his
stockings
and
spread
them
out
to
dry
the
action
reminded
him
of
miss
deane
necessities
he
hurried
to
a
point
whence
he
could
call
out
to
her
and
recommend
her
to
dry
some
of
her
clothing
during
his
absence
he
retired
even
more
quickly
fearing
lest
he
should
be
seen
iris
had
already
displayed
to
the
sunlight
a
large
portion
of
her
costume
without
further
delay
he
set
about
a
disagreeable
but
necessary
task
from
the
pockets
of
the
first
officer
and
doctor
he
secured
two
revolvers
and
a
supply
of
cartridges
evidently
intended
to
settle
any
dispute
which
might
have
arisen
between
the
ship
officers
and
the
native
members
of
the
crew
he
hoped
the
cartridges
were
uninjured
but
he
could
not
test
them
at
the
moment
for
fear
of
alarming
miss
deane
both
officers
carried
and
pencils
in
one
of
these
containing
dry
leaves
the
sailor
made
a
careful
inventory
of
the
money
and
other
valuable
effects
he
found
upon
the
dead
besides
noting
names
and
documents
where
possible
curiously
enough
the
capitalist
of
this
island
morgue
was
a
lascar
jemadar
who
in
a
belt
around
his
waist
hoarded
more
than
one
hundred
pounds
in
gold
the
sailor
tied
in
a
handkerchief
all
the
money
he
collected
and
ranged
letters
and
jewelry
in
separate
little
heaps
then
he
stripped
the
men
of
their
boots
and
outer
clothing
he
could
not
tell
how
long
the
girl
and
he
might
be
detained
on
the
island
before
help
came
and
fresh
garments
were
essential
it
would
be
foolish
sentimentality
to
trust
to
stores
thrown
ashore
from
the
ship
nevertheless
when
it
became
necessary
to
search
and
disrobe
the
women
he
almost
broke
down
for
an
instant
he
softened
gulping
back
his
emotions
with
a
savage
imprecation
he
doggedly
persevered
at
last
he
paused
to
consider
what
should
be
done
with
the
bodies
his
first
intent
was
to
scoop
a
large
hole
in
the
sand
with
a
piece
of
timber
but
when
he
took
into
consideration
the
magnitude
of
the
labor
involved
requiring
many
hours
of
hard
work
and
a
waste
of
precious
time
which
might
be
of
infinite
value
to
his
helpless
companion
and
himself
he
was
forced
to
abandon
the
project
it
was
not
only
impracticable
but
dangerous
again
he
had
to
set
his
teeth
with
grim
resolution
one
by
one
the
bodies
were
shot
into
the
lagoon
from
the
little
quay
of
rock
he
knew
they
would
not
be
seen
again
he
was
quite
unnerved
now
he
felt
as
if
he
had
committed
a
colossal
crime
in
the
smooth
water
of
the
cove
a
number
of
black
fins
were
cutting
ripples
the
sharks
were
soon
busy
he
shuddered
god
providence
had
ferried
him
and
the
girl
across
that
very
place
a
few
hours
ago
how
wonderful
that
he
and
she
should
be
snatched
from
the
sea
whilst
hundreds
perished
why
was
it
and
those
others
why
were
they
denied
rescue
for
an
instant
he
was
nearer
to
prayer
than
he
had
been
for
years
some
lurking
fiend
of
recollection
sprang
from
out
the
vista
of
bygone
years
and
choked
back
the
impulse
he
arose
and
shook
himself
like
a
dog
there
was
much
to
be
done
he
gathered
the
clothes
and
other
articles
into
a
heap
and
placed
portions
of
shattered
near
to
mislead
iris
whilst
thus
engaged
he
kicked
up
out
of
the
sand
a
rusty
kriss
or
malay
sword
the
presence
of
this
implement
startled
him
he
examined
it
slowly
and
thrust
it
out
of
sight
then
he
went
back
to
her
after
donning
his
stockings
and
boots
now
thoroughly
dry
are
you
ready
now
miss
deane
he
sang
out
cheerily
ready
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
jenks
chuckled
quietly
i
must
guard
my
tongue
it
betrays
me
he
said
to
himself
iris
joined
him
by
some
mysterious
means
she
had
effected
great
improvement
in
her
appearance
yet
there
were
manifest
gaps
if
only
i
had
a
needle
and
thread
she
began
if
that
is
all
said
the
sailor
fumbling
in
his
pockets
he
produced
a
shabby
little
hussif
containing
a
thimble
scissors
needles
and
some
skeins
of
unbleached
thread
case
and
contents
were
sodden
or
rusted
with
salt
water
but
the
girl
fastened
upon
this
treasure
with
a
sigh
of
deep
content
now
please
she
cried
i
want
a
telegraph
office
and
a
ship
it
was
impossible
to
resist
the
infection
of
her
high
spirits
this
time
he
laughed
without
concealment
we
will
look
for
them
miss
deane
meanwhile
will
you
oblige
me
by
wearing
this
the
sun
is
climbing
up
rapidly
he
handed
her
a
which
he
carried
he
had
secured
another
for
himself
the
merriment
died
away
from
her
face
she
remembered
his
errand
being
an
eminently
sensible
young
woman
she
made
no
protest
even
forcing
herself
to
tie
the
strings
beneath
her
chin
when
they
reached
the
sands
she
caught
sight
of
the
pile
of
clothes
and
the
broken
woodwork
with
the
small
heaps
of
valuables
methodically
arranged
the
harmless
subterfuge
did
not
deceive
her
she
darted
a
quick
look
of
gratitude
at
her
companion
how
thoughtful
he
was
after
a
fearful
glance
around
she
was
reassured
though
she
wondered
what
had
become
of
them
i
see
you
have
been
busy
she
said
nodding
towards
the
clothes
and
boots
it
was
his
turn
to
steal
a
look
of
sharp
inquiry
an
easier
task
to
read
the
records
of
time
in
the
solid
rock
than
to
glean
knowledge
from
the
girl
face
yes
he
replied
simply
lucky
find
was
it
most
fortunate
when
they
are
quite
dry
i
will
replenish
my
wardrobe
what
is
the
first
thing
to
be
done
well
miss
deane
i
think
our
programme
is
in
the
first
place
to
examine
the
articles
thrown
ashore
and
see
if
any
of
the
cases
contain
food
secondly
we
should
haul
high
and
dry
everything
that
may
be
of
use
to
us
lest
the
weather
should
break
again
and
the
next
tide
sweep
away
the
spoil
thirdly
we
should
eat
and
rest
and
finally
we
must
explore
the
island
before
the
light
fails
i
am
convinced
we
are
alone
here
it
is
a
small
place
at
the
best
and
if
any
chinamen
were
ashore
they
would
have
put
in
an
appearance
long
since
do
you
think
then
that
we
may
remain
here
long
it
is
impossible
to
form
an
opinion
on
that
point
help
may
come
in
a
day
on
the
other
hand
yes
it
is
a
wise
thing
miss
deane
to
prepare
for
other
contingencies
she
stood
still
and
swept
the
horizon
with
comprehensive
eyes
the
storm
had
vanished
masses
of
cloud
were
passing
away
to
the
west
leaving
a
glorious
expanse
of
blue
sky
already
the
sea
was
calming
huge
breakers
roared
over
the
reef
but
beyond
it
the
waves
were
subsiding
into
a
heavy
unbroken
swell
the
sailor
watched
her
closely
in
the
quaint
oilskin
hat
and
her
tattered
muslin
dress
she
looked
bewitchingly
pretty
she
reminded
him
of
a
and
beautiful
society
lady
whom
he
once
saw
figuring
as
grace
darling
at
a
fashionable
bazaar
but
miss
iris
thoughts
were
serious
do
you
mean
she
said
slowly
without
moving
her
gaze
from
the
distant
of
sky
and
water
that
we
may
be
imprisoned
here
for
weeks
perhaps
months
if
you
cast
your
mind
back
a
few
hours
you
will
perhaps
admit
that
we
are
very
fortunate
to
be
here
at
all
she
whisked
round
upon
him
do
not
fence
with
my
question
jenks
answer
me
he
bowed
there
was
a
perceptible
return
of
his
stubborn
cynicism
when
he
spoke
the
facts
are
obvious
miss
deane
the
loss
of
the
will
not
be
definitely
known
for
many
days
it
will
be
assumed
that
she
has
broken
down
the
agents
in
singapore
will
await
cabled
tidings
of
her
whereabouts
she
might
have
drifted
anywhere
in
that
typhoon
ultimately
they
will
send
out
a
vessel
to
search
impelled
to
that
course
a
little
earlier
by
your
father
anxiety
pardon
me
i
did
not
intend
to
pain
you
i
am
speaking
my
mind
go
on
said
iris
bravely
the
relief
ship
must
search
the
entire
china
sea
the
gale
might
have
driven
a
disabled
steamer
north
south
east
or
west
a
typhoon
travels
in
a
whirling
spiral
you
see
and
the
direction
of
a
drifting
ship
depends
wholly
upon
the
locality
where
she
sustained
damage
the
coasts
of
china
java
borneo
and
the
philippines
are
not
equipped
with
lighthouses
on
every
headland
and
cordoned
with
telegraph
wires
there
are
river
pirates
and
savage
races
to
be
reckoned
with
casting
aside
all
other
possibilities
and
assuming
that
a
prompt
search
is
made
to
the
south
of
our
course
this
part
of
the
ocean
is
full
of
reefs
and
small
islands
some
inhabited
permanently
others
visited
occasionally
by
fishermen
he
was
about
to
add
something
but
checked
himself
to
sum
up
he
continued
hurriedly
we
may
have
to
remain
here
for
many
days
even
months
there
is
always
a
chance
of
speedy
help
we
must
act
however
on
the
basis
of
detention
for
an
indefinite
period
i
am
discussing
appearances
as
they
are
a
survey
of
the
island
may
change
all
these
views
in
what
way
he
turned
and
pointed
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
behind
them
from
that
point
he
said
we
may
see
other
and
larger
islands
if
so
they
will
certainly
be
inhabited
i
am
surprised
this
one
is
not
he
ended
abruptly
they
were
losing
time
before
iris
could
join
him
he
was
already
hauling
a
large
undamaged
case
out
of
the
water
he
laughed
unmirthfully
champagne
he
said
a
good
brand
too
this
man
was
certainly
an
enigma
iris
wrinkled
her
pretty
forehead
in
the
effort
to
place
him
in
a
fitting
category
his
words
and
accent
were
those
of
an
educated
gentleman
yet
his
actions
and
manners
were
studiously
uncouth
when
he
thought
she
was
observing
him
the
veneer
of
roughness
puzzled
her
that
he
was
naturally
of
refined
temperament
she
knew
quite
well
not
alone
by
perception
but
by
the
plain
evidence
of
his
earlier
dealings
with
her
then
why
this
affectation
of
coarseness
this
borrowed
aroma
of
the
steward
mess
and
the
forecastle
to
the
best
of
her
ability
she
silently
helped
in
the
work
of
salvage
they
made
a
queer
collection
a
case
of
champagne
and
another
of
brandy
a
box
of
books
a
pair
of
night
glasses
a
compass
several
boxes
of
ship
biscuits
coated
with
salt
but
saved
by
their
hardness
having
been
immersed
but
a
few
seconds
two
large
cases
of
hams
in
equally
good
condition
some
huge
a
bit
of
twisted
ironwork
and
a
great
quantity
of
cordage
and
timber
there
was
one
very
heavy
package
which
their
united
strength
could
not
lift
the
sailor
searched
round
until
he
found
an
iron
bar
that
could
be
wrenched
from
its
socket
with
this
he
pried
open
the
strong
outer
cover
and
revealed
the
contents
regulation
boxes
of
ammunition
each
containing
rounds
ah
he
cried
now
we
want
some
rifles
what
good
would
they
be
inquired
iris
he
softly
denounced
himself
as
a
fool
but
he
answered
at
once
to
shoot
birds
of
course
miss
deane
there
are
plenty
here
and
many
of
them
are
edible
you
have
two
revolvers
and
some
cartridges
yes
they
are
useful
in
a
way
but
not
for
pot
hunting
how
stupid
of
me
what
you
really
need
is
a
he
smiled
grimly
at
times
his
sense
of
humor
forced
a
way
through
the
outward
shield
of
reserve
of
defiance
it
might
be
the
only
persons
i
ever
heard
of
he
said
who
landed
under
compulsion
on
a
desert
island
with
a
of
requisites
were
the
swiss
family
robinson
good
gracious
cried
iris
irrelevantly
i
had
not
even
thought
of
robinson
crusoe
until
this
moment
is
it
odd
i
we
she
pulled
herself
up
short
firmly
resolved
not
to
blush
without
flinching
she
challenged
him
to
complete
her
sentence
he
dared
not
do
it
he
could
not
be
mean
enough
to
take
advantage
of
her
slip
instantly
he
helped
her
embarrassment
i
hope
the
parallel
will
not
hold
good
he
said
in
any
event
you
miss
deane
fill
a
part
less
familiar
in
fiction
the
phrase
was
neat
it
meant
much
or
little
as
fancy
dictated
iris
at
first
felt
profoundly
grateful
for
his
tact
thinking
the
words
over
at
leisure
she
became
hot
and
very
angry
they
worked
in
silence
for
another
hour
the
sun
was
nearing
the
zenith
they
were
distressed
with
the
increasing
heat
of
the
day
jenks
secured
a
ham
and
some
biscuits
some
pieces
of
driftwood
and
the
binoculars
and
invited
miss
deane
to
accompany
him
to
the
grove
she
obeyed
without
a
word
though
she
wondered
how
he
proposed
to
light
a
fire
to
contribute
something
towards
the
expected
feast
she
picked
up
a
and
a
bottle
of
champagne
the
sailor
eyed
the
concluding
item
with
disfavor
not
whilst
the
sun
is
up
he
said
in
the
evening
yes
it
was
for
you
explained
iris
coldly
i
do
not
drink
wine
you
must
break
the
pledge
whilst
you
are
here
miss
deane
it
is
often
very
cold
at
night
in
this
latitude
a
chill
would
mean
fever
and
perhaps
death
what
a
strange
man
murmured
the
girl
she
covertly
watched
his
preparations
he
tore
a
dry
leaf
from
a
notebook
and
broke
the
bullet
out
of
a
cartridge
damping
the
powder
with
water
from
a
smearing
the
composition
on
the
paper
he
placed
it
in
the
sun
where
it
dried
at
once
he
gathered
a
small
bundle
of
withered
spines
from
the
palms
and
arranged
the
driftwood
on
top
choosing
a
place
for
his
bonfire
just
within
the
shade
then
inserting
the
among
the
spines
he
unscrewed
one
of
the
lenses
of
the
binoculars
converted
it
into
a
and
had
a
fine
blaze
roaring
merrily
in
a
few
minutes
with
the
aid
of
pointed
sticks
he
grilled
some
slices
of
ham
cut
with
his
which
he
first
carefully
cleaned
in
the
earth
the
biscuits
were
of
the
variety
that
become
soft
when
toasted
and
so
he
balanced
a
few
by
stones
near
the
fire
iris
forgot
her
annoyance
in
her
interest
a
most
appetizing
smell
filled
the
air
they
were
having
a
picnic
amidst
delightful
surroundings
yesterday
at
this
time
she
almost
yielded
to
a
rush
of
sentiment
but
forced
it
back
with
instant
determination
tears
were
a
poor
resource
unmindful
of
god
goodness
to
herself
and
her
companion
without
the
sailor
what
would
have
become
of
her
even
were
she
thrown
ashore
while
still
living
she
knew
none
of
the
expedients
which
seemed
to
be
at
his
command
it
was
a
most
ungrateful
proceeding
to
be
vexed
with
him
for
her
own
thoughtless
suggestion
that
she
occupied
a
new
rôle
as
crusoe
can
i
do
nothing
to
help
she
exclaimed
so
contrite
was
her
tone
that
jenks
was
astonished
yes
he
said
pointing
to
the
if
you
polish
the
top
of
that
with
your
sleeve
it
will
serve
as
a
plate
luncheon
is
ready
he
neatly
dished
up
two
slices
of
ham
on
a
couple
of
biscuits
and
handed
them
to
her
with
the
i
can
depend
on
my
fingers
he
explained
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
have
you
led
an
adventurous
life
she
asked
by
way
of
polite
conversation
no
he
growled
i
only
thought
so
because
you
appear
to
know
all
sorts
of
dodges
for
prolonging
existence
things
i
never
heard
of
broiled
ham
and
biscuits
for
instance
at
another
time
iris
would
have
snapped
at
him
for
the
retort
still
humbly
regretful
for
her
previous
attitude
she
answered
meekly
yes
in
this
manner
of
cooking
them
i
mean
but
there
are
other
items
methods
of
lighting
fires
finding
water
knowing
what
fruits
and
other
articles
may
be
found
on
a
desert
island
such
as
plantains
and
cocoanuts
certain
sorts
of
birds
and
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
tell
why
she
tacked
on
that
weird
item
to
her
list
the
sailor
inquired
more
civilly
then
you
are
acquainted
with
trepang
who
trepang
you
know
iris
made
a
desperate
guess
yes
she
said
demurely
it
makes
beautiful
backs
for
hair
brushes
and
it
looks
so
nice
as
a
frame
for
platinotype
photographs
i
have
jenks
swallowed
a
large
piece
of
ham
and
became
very
red
at
last
he
managed
to
say
i
beg
your
pardon
you
are
thinking
of
is
a
sort
of
marine
slug
how
odd
said
iris
she
had
discovered
at
an
early
age
the
tactical
value
of
this
remark
and
the
experience
of
maturer
years
confirmed
the
success
of
juvenile
efforts
to
upset
the
equanimity
of
governesses
even
the
sailor
was
silenced
talk
ceased
until
the
meal
was
ended
jenks
sprang
lightly
to
his
feet
rest
and
food
had
restored
his
faculties
the
girl
thought
dreamily
as
he
stood
there
in
his
rough
attire
that
she
had
never
seen
a
finer
man
he
was
tall
sinewy
and
well
formed
in
repose
his
face
was
pleasant
if
masterful
its
somewhat
sullen
expression
was
occasional
and
acquired
she
wondered
how
he
could
be
so
energetic
personally
she
was
consumed
with
sleepiness
he
produced
a
revolver
do
you
mind
if
i
fire
a
shot
to
test
these
cartridges
he
inquired
the
powder
is
all
right
but
the
fulminate
in
the
caps
may
be
damaged
she
agreed
promptly
he
pointed
the
weapon
at
a
cluster
of
cocoanuts
and
there
was
a
loud
report
two
nuts
fell
to
the
ground
and
the
air
was
filled
with
shrill
screams
and
the
flapping
of
innumerable
wings
iris
was
momentarily
dismayed
but
her
senses
confirmed
the
explanation
he
reloaded
the
empty
chamber
and
was
about
to
say
something
when
a
queer
sound
exactly
resembling
the
gurgling
of
water
poured
from
a
large
bottle
fell
upon
their
ears
it
came
from
the
interior
of
the
grove
and
the
two
exchanged
a
quick
look
of
amazed
questioning
jenks
took
a
hasty
step
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
but
he
stopped
and
laughed
at
his
own
expense
iris
liked
the
sound
of
his
mirth
it
was
genuine
not
forced
i
remember
now
he
explained
the
monkey
cries
in
that
peculiar
warble
the
presence
of
the
animal
here
shows
that
the
island
has
been
inhabited
at
some
time
you
remember
repeated
the
girl
then
you
have
been
in
this
part
of
the
world
before
no
i
mean
i
have
read
about
it
twice
in
half
an
hour
had
he
curtly
declined
to
indulge
in
personal
reminiscences
can
you
use
a
revolver
he
went
on
my
father
taught
me
he
thinks
every
woman
should
know
how
to
defend
herself
if
need
be
excellent
well
miss
deane
you
must
try
to
sleep
for
a
couple
of
hours
i
purpose
examining
the
coast
for
some
distance
on
each
side
should
you
want
me
a
shot
will
be
the
best
sort
of
signal
i
am
very
tired
she
admitted
but
you
oh
i
am
all
right
i
feel
restless
that
is
i
mean
i
will
not
be
able
to
sleep
until
night
comes
and
before
we
climb
the
hill
to
survey
our
domain
i
want
to
find
better
quarters
than
we
now
possess
perhaps
were
she
less
fatigued
she
would
have
caught
the
vague
anxiety
the
note
of
distrust
in
his
voice
but
the
carpet
of
sand
and
leaves
on
which
she
lay
was
very
seductive
her
eyes
closed
she
nestled
into
a
comfortable
position
and
slept
the
man
looked
at
her
steadily
for
a
little
while
then
he
moved
the
revolver
out
of
harm
way
to
a
spot
where
she
must
see
it
instantly
pulled
his
well
over
his
eyes
and
walked
off
quietly
they
were
flung
ashore
on
the
side
of
the
island
except
for
the
cove
formed
by
the
coral
reef
with
its
mysterious
growing
apparently
in
the
midst
of
the
waves
the
shape
of
the
coast
was
roughly
that
of
the
concave
side
of
a
bow
the
two
visible
extremities
being
about
of
a
mile
apart
he
guessed
by
the
way
in
which
the
sea
raced
past
these
points
that
the
land
did
not
extend
beyond
them
behind
him
it
rose
steeply
to
a
considerable
height
or
feet
in
the
center
was
the
tallest
hill
which
seemed
to
end
abruptly
towards
the
on
the
side
it
was
connected
with
a
rocky
promontory
by
a
ridge
of
easy
grade
the
sailor
turned
to
the
as
offering
the
most
likely
direction
for
rapid
survey
he
followed
the
line
of
vegetation
there
the
ground
was
firm
and
level
there
was
no
suggestion
of
the
mariner
roll
in
his
steady
gait
alter
his
clothing
change
the
heavy
boots
into
spurred
wellingtons
and
he
would
be
the
of
a
cavalry
soldier
the
order
of
melchisedec
in
the
profession
of
arms
he
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
the
hill
terminated
in
a
sheer
wall
of
rock
which
stood
out
ominous
and
massive
from
the
wealth
of
verdure
clothing
the
remainder
of
the
ridge
facing
the
precipice
and
separated
from
it
by
a
strip
of
ground
not
twenty
feet
above
the
in
the
highest
part
was
another
eminence
quite
bare
of
trees
blackened
by
the
weather
and
scarred
in
a
manner
that
attested
the
attacks
of
lightning
he
whistled
softly
by
jove
he
said
volcanic
and
highly
mineralized
the
intervening
belt
was
sparsely
dotted
with
trees
casuarinas
poon
and
other
woods
he
did
not
know
resembling
ebony
and
cedar
a
number
of
stumps
showed
that
the
axe
had
been
at
work
but
not
recently
he
passed
into
the
cleft
and
climbed
a
tree
that
offered
easy
access
as
he
expected
after
rising
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
his
eyes
encountered
the
solemn
blue
line
of
the
sea
not
half
a
mile
distant
he
descended
and
commenced
a
systematic
search
men
had
been
here
was
there
a
house
would
he
suddenly
encounter
some
hermit
malay
or
chinaman
at
the
foot
of
the
main
cliff
was
a
cluster
of
trees
plantains
and
a
couple
of
cinchonas
caught
his
eye
in
one
spot
the
undergrowth
was
rank
and
vividly
green
the
cassava
or
tapioca
plant
reared
its
high
leaves
above
the
grass
and
some
thrust
aloft
their
trunks
here
is
a
change
of
menu
at
any
rate
he
communed
breaking
a
thick
branch
off
a
poon
tree
he
whittled
away
the
minor
stems
a
strong
stick
was
needful
to
explore
that
leafy
fastness
thoroughly
a
few
cautious
strides
and
vigorous
whacks
with
the
stick
laid
bare
the
cause
of
such
prodigality
in
a
soil
covered
with
drifted
sand
and
lumps
of
black
and
white
speckled
coral
the
trees
and
bushes
enclosed
a
well
it
in
fact
from
being
choked
with
sand
during
the
first
gale
that
blew
delighted
with
this
discovery
more
precious
than
diamonds
at
the
moment
for
he
doubted
the
advisability
of
existing
on
the
water
supply
of
the
he
knelt
to
peer
into
the
excavation
the
well
had
been
properly
made
ten
feet
down
he
could
see
the
reflection
of
his
face
expert
hands
had
tapped
the
secret
reservoir
of
the
island
by
stretching
to
the
full
extent
of
his
arm
he
managed
to
plunge
the
stick
into
the
water
tasting
the
drops
he
found
that
they
were
quite
sweet
the
sand
and
porous
rock
provided
the
best
of
he
rose
wall
pleased
and
noted
that
on
the
opposite
side
the
appearance
of
the
shrubs
and
tufts
of
long
grass
indicated
the
existence
of
a
path
towards
the
cliff
he
followed
it
walking
carelessly
with
eyes
seeking
the
prospect
beyond
when
something
rattled
and
cracked
beneath
his
feet
looking
down
he
was
horrified
to
find
he
was
trampling
on
a
skeleton
had
a
venomous
snake
coiled
its
glistening
folds
around
his
leg
he
would
not
have
been
more
startled
but
this
man
of
iron
nerve
soon
recovered
he
frowned
deeply
after
the
first
involuntary
with
the
stick
he
cleared
away
the
undergrowth
and
revealed
the
skeleton
of
a
man
the
bones
were
big
and
strong
but
oxidized
by
the
action
of
the
air
jenks
had
injured
the
left
tibia
by
his
tread
but
three
fractured
ribs
and
a
smashed
told
some
terrible
unwritten
story
beneath
the
mournful
relics
were
fragments
of
decayed
cloth
it
was
blue
serge
lying
about
were
a
few
blackened
objects
brass
buttons
marked
with
an
anchor
the
dead
man
boots
were
in
the
best
state
of
preservation
but
the
leather
had
shrunk
and
the
nails
protruded
like
fangs
a
rusted
lay
there
and
on
the
left
breast
of
the
skeleton
rested
a
round
piece
of
tin
the
top
of
a
canister
which
might
have
reposed
in
a
coat
pocket
jenks
picked
it
up
some
curious
marks
and
figures
were
punched
into
its
surface
after
a
hasty
glance
he
put
it
aside
for
more
leisurely
examination
no
weapon
was
visible
he
could
form
no
estimate
as
to
the
cause
of
the
death
of
this
poor
unknown
nor
the
time
since
the
tragedy
had
occurred
jenks
must
have
stood
many
minutes
before
he
perceived
that
the
skeleton
was
headless
at
first
he
imagined
that
in
rummaging
about
with
the
stick
he
had
disturbed
the
skull
but
the
most
minute
search
demonstrated
that
it
had
gone
had
been
taken
away
in
fact
for
the
plants
which
so
effectually
screened
the
lighter
bones
would
not
permit
the
skull
to
vanish
then
the
frown
on
the
sailor
face
became
threatening
thunderous
he
recollected
the
rusty
kriss
indistinct
memories
of
strange
tales
of
the
china
sea
crowded
unbidden
to
his
brain
dyaks
he
growled
fiercely
a
ship
officer
an
englishman
probably
murdered
by
dyak
pirates
if
they
came
once
they
would
come
again
five
hundred
yards
away
iris
deane
was
sleeping
he
ought
not
to
have
left
her
alone
and
then
with
the
devilish
ingenuity
of
coincidence
a
revolver
shot
awoke
the
echoes
and
sent
all
manner
of
wildfowl
hurtling
through
the
trees
with
clamorous
outcry
panting
and
jenks
was
at
the
girl
side
in
an
inconceivably
short
space
of
time
she
was
not
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
grove
but
on
the
sands
gazing
pallid
in
cheek
and
lip
at
the
group
of
rocks
on
the
edge
of
the
lagoon
what
is
the
matter
he
gasped
oh
i
do
know
she
wailed
brokenly
i
had
a
dream
such
a
horrible
dream
you
were
struggling
with
some
awful
thing
down
there
she
pointed
to
the
rocks
i
was
not
near
the
place
he
said
laboriously
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
breathe
his
broad
chest
expanded
inches
with
each
respiration
yes
yes
i
understand
but
i
awoke
and
ran
to
save
you
when
i
got
here
i
saw
something
a
thing
with
waving
arms
and
fired
it
vanished
and
then
you
came
the
sailor
walked
slowly
to
the
rocks
a
fresh
chip
out
of
the
stone
showed
where
the
bullet
struck
one
huge
boulder
was
wet
as
if
water
had
been
splashed
over
it
he
halted
and
looked
intently
into
the
water
not
a
fish
was
to
be
seen
but
small
spirals
of
sand
were
eddying
up
from
the
bottom
where
it
shelved
steeply
from
the
shore
iris
followed
him
see
she
cried
excitedly
i
was
not
mistaken
there
something
here
a
creepy
sensation
ran
up
the
man
spine
and
passed
behind
his
ears
at
this
spot
the
drowned
lascars
were
lying
like
an
inspiration
came
the
knowledge
that
the
cuttlefish
the
dreaded
octopus
abounds
in
the
china
sea
his
face
was
livid
when
he
turned
to
iris
you
are
by
fatigue
miss
deane
he
said
what
you
saw
was
probably
a
seal
he
knew
the
ludicrous
substitution
would
not
be
questioned
please
go
and
lie
down
again
i
can
not
she
protested
i
am
too
frightened
frightened
by
a
dream
in
broad
daylight
but
why
are
so
pale
what
has
alarmed
you
can
you
ask
did
you
not
give
the
agreed
signal
yes
but
her
inquiring
glance
fell
he
was
breathless
from
agitation
rather
than
running
he
was
perturbed
on
her
account
for
an
instant
she
had
looked
into
his
soul
i
will
go
back
she
said
quietly
though
i
would
rather
accompany
you
what
are
you
doing
seeking
a
place
to
lay
our
heads
he
answered
with
gruff
carelessness
you
really
must
rest
miss
deane
otherwise
you
will
be
broken
up
by
fatigue
and
become
so
iris
again
sought
her
couch
of
sand
and
the
sailor
returned
to
the
skeleton
they
separated
unwillingly
each
thinking
only
of
the
safety
and
comfort
the
girl
knew
she
was
not
wanted
because
the
man
wished
to
spare
her
some
unpleasant
experience
she
obeyed
him
with
a
sigh
and
sat
down
not
to
sleep
but
to
muse
as
girls
will
wistful
with
the
angelic
fantasy
of
youth
and
innocence
chapter
iv
rainbow
island
across
the
parched
bones
lay
the
stick
discarded
by
jenks
in
his
alarm
he
picked
it
up
and
resumed
his
progress
along
the
pathway
so
closely
did
he
now
examine
the
ground
that
he
hardly
noted
his
direction
the
track
led
straight
towards
the
wall
of
rock
the
distance
was
not
great
about
forty
yards
at
first
the
brushwood
impeded
him
but
soon
even
this
hindrance
disappeared
and
a
passage
meandered
through
a
belt
of
trees
some
strong
and
lofty
others
quite
immature
more
bushes
gathered
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
behind
them
he
could
see
the
mouth
of
a
cave
the
six
months
old
growth
of
vegetation
about
the
entrance
gave
clear
indication
as
to
the
time
which
had
elapsed
since
a
human
foot
last
disturbed
the
solitude
a
few
vigorous
blows
with
the
stick
cleared
away
obstructing
plants
and
leafy
branches
the
sailor
stooped
and
looked
into
the
cavern
for
the
opening
was
barely
five
feet
high
he
perceived
instantly
that
the
excavation
was
man
handiwork
applied
to
a
fault
in
the
hard
rock
a
sort
of
natural
shaft
existed
and
this
had
been
extended
by
manual
labor
beyond
the
entrance
the
cave
became
more
lofty
owing
to
its
position
with
reference
to
the
sun
at
that
hour
jenks
imagined
that
sufficient
light
would
be
obtainable
when
the
tropical
luxuriance
of
foliage
outside
was
dispensed
with
at
present
the
interior
was
dark
with
the
stick
he
tapped
the
walls
and
roof
a
startled
cluck
and
the
rush
of
wings
heralded
the
flight
of
two
birds
alarmed
by
the
noise
soon
his
eyes
more
accustomed
to
the
gloom
made
out
that
the
place
was
about
thirty
feet
deep
ten
feet
wide
in
the
center
and
seven
or
eight
feet
high
at
the
further
end
was
a
collection
of
objects
inviting
prompt
attention
each
moment
he
could
see
with
greater
distinctness
kneeling
on
one
side
of
the
little
pile
he
discerned
that
on
a
large
stone
serving
as
a
rude
bench
were
some
tin
utensils
some
knives
a
sextant
and
a
quantity
of
empty
cartridge
cases
between
the
stone
and
what
a
miner
terms
the
face
of
the
rock
was
a
space
here
half
imbedded
in
the
sand
which
covered
the
floor
were
two
pickaxes
a
shovel
a
a
fine
axe
and
three
crowbars
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
cave
extremity
the
wall
appeared
to
be
very
smooth
he
prodded
with
the
stick
and
there
was
a
sharp
clang
of
tin
he
discovered
six
square
cases
carefully
stacked
up
three
were
empty
one
seemed
to
be
half
full
and
the
contents
of
two
were
untouched
with
almost
feverish
haste
he
ascertained
that
the
tin
did
really
contain
oil
what
a
find
he
ejaculated
aloud
another
pair
of
birds
dashed
from
a
ledge
near
the
roof
confound
you
shouted
the
sailor
he
sprang
back
and
whacked
the
walls
viciously
but
all
the
feathered
intruders
had
gone
so
far
as
he
could
judge
the
cave
harbored
no
further
surprises
returning
towards
the
exit
his
boots
dislodged
more
empty
cartridges
from
the
sand
they
were
shells
adapted
to
a
revolver
of
heavy
caliber
at
a
short
distance
from
the
doorway
they
were
present
in
dozens
the
remnants
of
a
fight
he
thought
the
man
was
attacked
and
defended
himself
here
not
expecting
the
arrival
of
enemies
he
provided
no
store
of
food
or
water
he
was
killed
whilst
trying
to
reach
the
well
probably
at
night
he
vividly
pictured
the
scene
a
brave
hardy
european
keeping
at
bay
a
boatload
of
dyak
savages
enduring
manfully
the
agonies
of
hunger
thirst
perhaps
wounds
then
the
siege
followed
by
a
wild
effort
to
gain
the
well
the
hiss
of
a
malay
parang
wielded
by
a
lurking
foe
and
the
last
despairing
struggle
before
death
came
he
might
be
mistaken
perchance
there
was
a
less
dramatic
explanation
but
he
could
not
shake
off
his
first
impressions
they
were
garnered
from
dumb
evidence
and
developed
by
some
occult
but
overwhelming
sense
of
certainty
what
was
the
poor
devil
doing
here
he
asked
why
did
he
bury
himself
in
this
rock
with
mining
utensils
and
a
few
rough
stores
he
could
not
be
a
castaway
there
is
the
indication
of
purpose
of
preparation
of
method
combined
with
ignorance
for
none
who
knew
the
ways
of
dyaks
and
chinese
pirates
would
venture
to
live
here
alone
if
he
could
help
it
and
if
he
really
were
alone
the
thing
was
a
mystery
would
probably
remain
a
mystery
for
ever
be
it
steel
or
be
it
lead
anyhow
the
man
is
dead
there
was
relief
in
hearing
his
own
voice
he
could
hum
and
think
and
act
arming
himself
with
the
axe
he
attacked
the
bushes
and
branches
of
trees
in
front
of
the
cave
he
cut
a
fresh
approach
to
the
well
and
threw
the
litter
over
the
skeleton
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
bury
it
where
it
lay
but
he
disliked
the
idea
of
iris
walking
unconsciously
over
the
place
no
time
could
be
wasted
that
day
he
would
seize
an
early
opportunity
to
act
as
after
an
absence
of
little
more
than
an
hour
he
rejoined
the
girl
she
saw
him
from
afar
and
wondered
whence
he
obtained
the
axe
he
shouldered
you
are
a
successful
explorer
she
cried
when
he
drew
near
yes
miss
deane
i
have
found
water
implements
a
shelter
even
light
what
sort
of
light
spiritual
or
material
oil
oh
iris
could
not
remain
serious
for
many
consecutive
minutes
but
she
gathered
that
he
was
in
no
mood
for
frivolity
and
the
shelter
is
it
a
house
she
continued
no
a
cave
if
you
are
sufficiently
rested
you
might
come
and
take
possession
her
eyes
danced
with
excitement
he
told
her
what
he
had
seen
with
reservations
and
she
ran
on
before
him
to
witness
these
marvels
why
did
you
make
a
new
path
to
the
well
she
inquired
after
a
rapid
survey
a
new
path
the
pertinent
question
staggered
him
yes
the
people
who
lived
here
must
have
had
some
sort
of
free
passage
he
lied
easily
i
have
only
cleared
away
recent
growth
he
said
and
why
did
they
dig
a
cave
it
surely
would
be
much
more
simple
to
build
a
house
from
all
these
trees
there
you
puzzle
me
he
said
frankly
they
had
entered
the
cavern
but
a
little
way
and
now
came
out
these
empty
cartridges
are
funny
they
suggest
a
fort
a
battle
her
words
were
carelessly
chosen
but
they
were
crammed
with
inductive
force
embarked
on
the
toboggan
slope
of
untruth
the
sailor
slid
smoothly
downwards
events
have
colored
your
imagination
miss
deane
even
in
england
men
often
preserve
such
things
for
future
use
they
can
be
reloaded
yes
i
have
seen
keepers
do
that
this
is
different
there
is
an
air
of
there
is
a
lot
to
be
done
broke
in
jenks
emphatically
we
must
climb
the
hill
and
get
back
here
in
time
to
light
another
fire
before
the
sun
goes
down
i
want
to
prop
a
canvas
sheet
in
front
of
the
cave
and
try
to
devise
a
lamp
must
i
sleep
inside
demanded
iris
yes
where
else
there
was
a
pause
a
mere
whiff
of
awkwardness
i
will
mount
guard
outside
went
on
jenks
he
was
trying
to
improve
the
edge
of
the
axe
by
grinding
it
on
a
soft
stone
the
girl
went
into
the
cave
again
she
was
inquisitive
uneasy
that
arrangement
she
began
but
ended
in
a
sharp
cry
of
terror
the
dispossessed
birds
had
returned
during
the
sailor
absence
i
will
kill
them
he
shouted
in
anger
please
do
there
has
been
enough
of
death
in
this
place
already
the
words
jarred
on
his
ears
then
he
felt
that
she
could
only
allude
to
the
victims
of
the
wreck
i
was
going
to
say
she
explained
that
we
must
devise
a
partition
there
is
no
help
for
it
until
you
construct
a
sort
of
house
candidly
i
do
not
like
this
hole
in
the
rock
it
is
a
vault
a
tomb
you
told
me
that
i
was
in
command
yet
you
dispute
my
orders
he
strove
hard
to
appear
brusquely
indifferent
though
for
one
of
his
mould
he
was
absurdly
irritable
the
cause
was
but
that
explanation
escaped
him
quite
true
but
if
sleeping
in
the
cold
in
dew
or
rain
is
bad
for
me
it
must
be
equally
bad
for
you
and
without
you
i
am
helpless
you
know
his
arms
twitched
to
give
her
a
reassuring
hug
in
some
respects
she
was
so
childlike
her
big
blue
eyes
were
so
ingenuous
he
laughed
sardonically
and
the
harsh
note
clashed
with
her
frank
candor
here
at
least
she
was
utterly
deceived
his
changeful
moods
were
incomprehensible
i
will
serve
you
to
the
best
of
my
ability
miss
deane
he
exclaimed
we
must
hope
for
a
speedy
rescue
and
i
am
inured
to
exposure
it
is
otherwise
with
you
are
you
ready
for
the
climb
mechanically
she
picked
up
a
stick
at
her
feet
it
was
the
wand
of
investigation
he
snatched
it
from
her
hands
and
threw
it
away
among
the
trees
that
is
a
dangerous
alpenstock
he
said
the
wood
is
unreliable
it
might
break
i
will
cut
you
a
better
one
and
he
swung
the
axe
against
a
tall
sapling
iris
mentally
described
him
as
funny
she
followed
him
in
the
upward
curve
of
the
ascent
for
the
grade
was
not
difficult
and
the
ground
smooth
enough
the
storms
of
years
having
pulverized
the
rock
and
driven
sand
into
its
clefts
the
persistent
inroads
of
the
trees
had
done
the
rest
beyond
the
flight
of
birds
and
the
scampering
of
some
tiny
monkeys
overhead
they
did
not
disturb
a
living
creature
the
crest
of
the
hill
was
and
they
could
see
nothing
beyond
their
immediate
locality
until
the
sailor
found
a
point
higher
than
the
rest
where
a
rugged
collection
of
hard
basalt
and
the
uprooting
of
some
poon
trees
provided
an
open
space
elevated
above
the
ridge
for
a
short
distance
the
foothold
was
precarious
jenks
helped
the
girl
in
this
part
of
the
climb
his
strong
gentle
grasp
gave
her
confidence
she
was
flushed
with
exertion
when
they
stood
together
on
the
summit
of
this
elevated
perch
they
could
look
to
every
point
of
the
compass
except
a
small
section
on
the
here
the
trees
rose
behind
them
until
the
brow
of
the
precipice
was
reached
the
emergence
into
a
sunlit
panorama
of
land
and
sea
though
expected
was
profoundly
enthralling
they
appeared
to
stand
almost
exactly
in
the
center
of
the
island
which
was
it
was
no
larger
than
the
sailor
had
estimated
the
new
slopes
now
revealed
were
covered
with
verdure
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
water
which
for
nearly
a
mile
seawards
broke
over
jagged
reefs
the
sea
looked
strangely
calm
from
this
height
irregular
blue
patches
on
the
horizon
to
south
and
east
caught
the
man
first
glance
he
unslung
the
binoculars
he
still
carried
and
focused
them
eagerly
islands
he
cried
and
big
ones
too
how
odd
whispered
iris
more
concerned
in
the
scrutiny
of
her
immediate
surroundings
jenks
glanced
at
her
sharply
she
was
not
looking
at
the
islands
but
at
a
curious
hollow
a
depression
beneath
them
to
the
right
distant
about
three
hundred
yards
and
not
far
removed
from
the
small
plateau
containing
the
well
though
isolated
from
it
by
the
south
angle
of
the
main
cliff
here
in
a
great
circle
there
was
not
a
vestige
of
grass
shrub
or
tree
nothing
save
brown
rock
and
sand
at
first
the
sailor
deemed
it
to
be
the
bed
of
a
small
lake
this
hypothesis
would
not
serve
else
it
would
be
choked
with
verdure
the
pit
stared
up
at
them
like
an
ominous
eye
though
neither
paid
further
attention
to
it
for
the
glorious
prospect
mapped
at
their
feet
momentarily
swept
aside
all
other
considerations
what
a
beautiful
place
murmured
iris
i
wonder
what
it
is
called
limbo
the
word
came
instantly
the
sailor
gaze
was
again
fixed
on
those
distant
blue
outlines
miss
deane
was
dissatisfied
nonsense
she
exclaimed
we
are
not
dead
yet
you
must
find
a
better
name
than
that
well
suppose
we
christen
it
rainbow
island
why
that
is
the
english
meaning
of
in
latin
you
know
so
it
is
how
clever
of
you
to
think
of
it
tell
me
what
is
the
meaning
of
in
greek
he
turned
to
survey
the
side
of
the
island
i
do
not
know
he
answered
it
might
not
be
to
translate
it
as
steward
a
menial
miss
iris
had
meant
her
playful
retort
as
a
mere
quibble
it
annoyed
her
a
young
person
of
much
consequence
to
have
her
kindly
condescension
repelled
i
suppose
so
she
agreed
but
i
have
gone
through
so
much
in
a
few
hours
that
i
am
bewildered
apt
to
forget
these
nice
distinctions
where
these
two
quareling
or
flirting
who
can
tell
jenks
was
closely
examining
the
reef
on
which
the
struck
some
square
objects
were
visible
near
the
palm
tree
the
sun
glinting
on
the
waves
rendered
it
difficult
to
discern
their
significance
what
do
you
make
of
those
he
inquired
handing
the
glasses
and
blandly
ignoring
miss
deane
petulance
her
brain
was
busy
with
other
things
while
she
twisted
the
binoculars
to
suit
her
vision
rainbow
island
iris
it
was
a
nice
conceit
but
menial
struck
a
discordant
note
this
man
was
no
menial
in
appearance
or
speech
why
was
he
so
deliberately
rude
i
think
they
are
boxes
or
she
announced
ah
that
was
my
own
idea
i
must
visit
that
locality
how
will
you
swim
no
he
said
his
stern
lips
relaxing
in
a
smile
i
will
not
swim
and
by
the
way
miss
deane
be
careful
when
you
are
near
the
water
the
lagoon
is
swarming
with
sharks
at
present
i
feel
tolerably
assured
that
at
low
tide
when
the
remnants
of
the
gale
have
vanished
i
will
be
able
to
walk
there
along
the
reef
sharks
she
cried
in
there
what
horrible
surprises
this
speck
of
land
contains
i
should
not
have
imagined
that
sharks
and
seals
could
live
together
you
are
quite
right
he
explained
with
becoming
gravity
as
a
rule
sharks
infest
only
the
leeward
side
of
these
islands
just
now
they
are
attracted
in
shoals
by
the
wreck
oh
iris
shivered
slightly
we
had
better
go
back
now
the
wind
is
keen
here
miss
deane
illustration
he
was
so
busy
that
he
paid
little
heed
to
iris
but
the
odor
of
fried
ham
was
wafted
to
him
she
knew
that
he
purposely
misunderstood
her
gesture
his
attitude
conveyed
a
rebuke
there
was
no
further
room
for
sentiment
in
their
present
existence
they
had
to
deal
with
chill
necessities
as
for
the
sailor
he
was
glad
that
the
chance
turn
of
their
conversation
enabled
him
to
warn
her
against
the
lurking
dangers
of
the
lagoon
there
was
no
need
to
mention
the
now
he
must
spare
her
all
avoidable
thrills
they
gathered
the
stores
from
the
first
and
reached
the
cave
without
incident
another
fire
was
lighted
and
whilst
iris
attended
to
the
kitchen
the
sailor
felled
several
young
trees
he
wanted
poles
and
these
were
the
right
size
and
shape
he
soon
cleared
a
considerable
space
the
timber
was
soft
and
so
small
in
girth
that
three
cuts
with
the
axe
usually
sufficed
he
dragged
from
the
beach
the
smallest
tarpaulin
he
could
find
and
propped
it
against
the
rock
in
such
manner
that
it
effectually
screened
the
mouth
of
the
cave
though
admitting
light
and
air
he
was
so
busy
that
he
paid
little
heed
to
iris
but
the
odor
of
fried
ham
was
wafted
to
him
he
was
lifting
a
couple
of
heavy
stones
to
stay
the
canvas
and
keep
it
from
flapping
in
the
wind
when
the
girl
called
out
would
you
like
to
have
a
wash
before
dinner
he
straightened
himself
and
looked
at
her
her
face
and
hands
were
shining
spotless
the
change
was
so
great
that
his
brow
wrinkled
with
perplexity
i
am
a
good
pupil
she
cried
you
see
i
am
already
learning
to
help
myself
i
made
a
bucket
out
of
one
of
the
by
slinging
it
in
two
ropes
another
some
sand
and
leaves
supplied
basin
soap
and
towel
i
have
cleaned
the
tin
cups
and
the
knives
and
see
here
is
my
greatest
treasure
she
held
up
a
small
metal
lamp
where
in
the
world
did
you
find
that
he
exclaimed
buried
in
the
sand
inside
the
cave
anything
else
his
tone
was
abrupt
she
was
so
disappointed
by
the
seeming
want
of
appreciation
of
her
industry
that
a
gleam
of
amusement
died
from
her
eyes
and
she
shook
her
head
stooping
at
once
to
attend
to
the
toasting
of
some
biscuits
this
time
he
was
genuinely
sorry
forgive
me
miss
deane
he
said
penitently
my
words
are
dictated
by
anxiety
i
do
not
wish
you
to
make
discoveries
on
your
own
account
this
is
a
strange
place
you
know
an
unpleasant
one
in
some
respects
surely
i
can
rummage
about
my
own
cave
most
certainly
it
was
careless
of
me
not
to
have
examined
its
interior
more
thoroughly
then
why
do
you
grumble
because
i
found
the
lamp
i
did
not
mean
any
such
thing
i
am
sorry
i
think
you
are
horrid
if
you
want
to
wash
you
will
find
the
water
over
there
do
wait
the
ham
will
be
frizzled
to
a
cinder
unlucky
jenks
was
ever
man
fated
to
incur
such
unmerited
odium
he
savagely
laved
his
face
and
neck
the
fresh
cool
water
was
delightful
at
first
but
it
caused
his
injured
nail
to
throb
dreadfully
when
he
drew
near
to
the
fire
he
experienced
an
unaccountable
sensation
of
weakness
could
it
be
possible
that
he
was
going
to
faint
it
was
too
absurd
he
sank
to
the
ground
trees
rocks
and
earth
indulged
in
a
mad
dance
iris
voice
sounded
weak
and
indistinct
it
seemed
to
travel
in
waves
from
a
great
distance
he
tried
to
brush
away
from
his
brain
these
dim
fancies
but
his
iron
will
for
once
failed
and
he
pitched
headlong
downwards
into
darkness
when
he
recovered
the
girl
left
arm
was
round
his
neck
for
one
blissful
instant
he
nestled
there
contentedly
he
looked
into
her
eyes
and
saw
that
she
was
crying
a
gust
of
anger
rose
within
him
that
he
should
be
the
cause
of
those
tears
damn
he
said
and
tried
to
rise
oh
are
you
better
her
lips
quivered
pitifully
yes
what
happened
did
i
faint
drink
this
she
held
a
cup
to
his
mouth
and
he
obediently
strove
to
swallow
the
contents
it
was
champagne
after
the
first
spasm
of
terror
and
when
the
application
of
water
to
his
face
failed
to
restore
consciousness
iris
had
knocked
the
head
off
the
bottle
of
champagne
he
quickly
revived
nature
had
only
given
him
a
warning
that
he
was
overdrawing
his
resources
he
was
deeply
humiliated
he
did
not
conceive
the
truth
that
only
a
strong
man
could
do
all
that
he
had
done
and
live
for
hours
he
had
not
slept
during
part
of
the
time
he
fought
with
wilder
beasts
than
they
knew
at
ephesus
the
long
exposure
to
the
sun
the
mental
strain
of
his
foreboding
that
the
charming
girl
whose
life
depended
upon
him
might
be
exposed
to
even
worse
dangers
than
any
yet
encountered
the
physical
labor
he
had
undergone
the
irksome
restraint
he
strove
to
place
upon
his
conduct
and
utterances
all
these
things
culminated
in
utter
relaxation
when
the
water
touched
his
heated
skin
but
he
was
really
very
much
annoyed
a
powerful
man
always
is
annoyed
when
forced
to
yield
the
revelation
of
a
limit
to
human
endurance
infuriates
him
a
woman
invariably
thinks
that
the
man
should
be
scolded
by
way
of
tonic
how
you
frighten
me
so
demanded
iris
hysterically
you
must
have
felt
that
you
were
working
too
hard
you
made
me
rest
why
did
you
rest
yourself
he
looked
at
her
wistfully
this
collapse
must
not
happen
again
for
her
sake
these
two
said
more
with
eyes
than
lips
she
withdrew
her
arm
her
face
and
neck
crimsoned
there
she
said
with
compelled
cheerfulness
you
are
all
right
now
finish
the
wine
he
emptied
the
tin
it
gave
him
new
life
i
always
thought
he
answered
gravely
that
champagne
was
worth
its
weight
in
gold
under
certain
conditions
these
are
the
conditions
iris
reflected
with
elastic
rebound
from
despair
to
relief
that
men
in
the
lower
ranks
of
life
do
not
usually
form
theories
on
the
expensive
virtues
of
the
wine
of
france
but
her
mind
was
suddenly
occupied
by
a
fresh
disaster
good
gracious
she
cried
the
ham
is
ruined
it
was
burnt
black
she
prepared
a
fresh
supply
when
it
was
ready
jenks
was
himself
again
they
ate
in
silence
and
shared
the
remains
of
the
bottle
the
man
idly
wondered
what
was
the
du
at
the
savoy
that
evening
he
remembered
that
the
last
time
he
was
there
he
had
called
for
de
york
aux
and
half
a
pint
of
heidseck
non
animum
mutant
qui
trans
mare
he
thought
by
a
queer
trick
of
memory
he
could
recall
the
very
page
in
horace
where
this
philosophical
line
occurs
it
was
in
the
eleventh
epistle
of
the
first
book
a
smile
illumined
his
tired
face
iris
was
watchful
she
had
never
in
her
life
cooked
even
a
potato
or
boiled
an
egg
the
ham
was
her
first
attempt
my
cooking
amuses
you
she
demanded
suspiciously
it
gratifies
every
sense
he
murmured
there
is
but
one
thing
needful
to
complete
my
happiness
and
that
is
permission
to
smoke
smoke
what
he
produced
a
steel
box
tightly
closed
and
a
pipe
i
will
answer
you
in
byron
words
he
said
tobacco
which
from
east
to
west
cheers
the
tar
labour
or
the
turkman
rest
your
pockets
are
absolute
shops
said
the
girl
delighted
that
his
temper
had
improved
what
other
stores
do
you
carry
about
with
you
he
lit
his
pipe
and
solemnly
gave
an
inventory
of
his
worldly
goods
beyond
the
items
she
had
previously
seen
he
could
only
enumerate
a
silver
dollar
a
very
soiled
and
crumpled
handkerchief
and
a
bit
of
tin
a
box
of
norwegian
matches
he
threw
away
as
useless
but
iris
recovered
them
you
never
know
what
purpose
they
may
serve
she
said
in
after
days
a
weird
significance
was
attached
to
this
simple
phrase
why
do
you
carry
about
a
bit
of
tin
she
went
on
how
the
atmosphere
of
deception
clung
to
him
here
was
a
man
compelled
to
lie
outrageously
who
in
happier
years
had
prided
himself
on
scrupulous
accuracy
even
in
small
things
plague
upon
it
he
silently
protested
subterfuge
and
deceit
are
as
much
at
home
in
this
deserted
island
as
in
mayfair
i
found
it
here
miss
deane
he
answered
luckily
she
interpreted
here
as
applying
to
the
cave
let
me
see
it
may
i
he
handed
it
to
her
she
could
make
nothing
of
it
so
together
they
puzzled
over
it
the
sailor
rubbed
it
with
a
mixture
of
kerosene
and
sand
then
figures
and
letters
and
a
sort
of
diagram
were
revealed
at
last
they
became
decipherable
by
exercising
patient
ingenuity
some
one
had
indented
the
metal
with
a
sharp
punch
until
the
marks
assumed
this
aspect
see
cut
following
page
iris
was
it
is
a
plan
of
the
island
she
cried
also
the
latitude
and
the
longitude
what
does
mean
probably
the
initials
of
a
man
name
let
us
say
john
smith
for
instance
and
the
figures
on
the
island
with
the
and
the
dot
i
can
not
tell
you
at
present
he
said
i
take
it
that
the
line
across
the
island
signifies
this
gap
or
canyon
and
the
small
intersecting
line
the
cave
but
divided
by
and
an
surmounted
by
a
dot
are
cabalistic
they
would
cause
even
sherlock
holmes
to
smoke
at
least
two
pipes
i
have
barely
started
one
illustration
she
ran
to
fetch
a
glowing
stick
to
enable
him
to
relight
his
pipe
why
do
you
give
me
such
nasty
little
digs
she
asked
you
need
not
have
stopped
smoking
just
because
i
stood
close
to
you
really
miss
deane
there
do
protest
i
like
the
smell
of
that
tobacco
i
thought
sailors
invariably
smoked
rank
black
stuff
which
they
call
thick
twist
i
am
a
beginner
as
a
sailor
after
a
few
more
years
before
the
mast
i
may
hope
to
reach
perfection
their
eyes
exchanged
a
quaintly
pleasant
challenge
thus
the
man
she
is
determined
to
learn
something
of
my
past
but
she
will
not
succeed
and
the
woman
the
wretch
he
is
close
as
an
oyster
but
i
will
make
him
open
his
mouth
see
if
i
do
she
reverted
to
the
piece
of
tin
it
looks
quite
mysterious
like
the
things
you
read
of
in
stories
of
pirates
and
buried
treasure
yes
he
admitted
it
is
unquestionably
a
plan
a
guidance
given
to
a
person
not
previously
acquainted
with
the
island
but
cognizant
of
some
fact
connected
with
it
unfortunately
none
of
the
buccaneers
i
can
bring
to
mind
frequented
these
seas
the
poor
beggar
who
left
it
here
must
have
had
some
other
motive
than
searching
for
a
cache
did
he
dig
the
cave
and
the
well
i
wonder
probably
the
former
but
not
the
well
no
man
could
do
it
unaided
why
do
you
assume
he
was
alone
he
strolled
towards
the
fire
to
kick
a
stray
log
it
is
only
idle
speculation
at
the
best
miss
deane
he
replied
would
you
like
to
help
me
to
drag
some
timber
up
from
the
beach
if
we
get
a
few
big
planks
we
can
build
a
fire
that
will
last
for
hours
we
want
some
extra
clothes
too
and
it
will
soon
be
dark
the
request
for
gratified
her
she
complied
eagerly
and
without
much
exertion
they
hauled
a
respectable
load
of
firewood
to
their
new
they
also
brought
a
number
of
coats
to
serve
as
coverings
then
jenks
tackled
the
lamp
between
the
rust
and
the
soreness
of
his
index
finger
it
was
a
most
difficult
operation
to
open
it
before
the
sun
went
down
he
succeeded
and
made
a
wick
by
unraveling
a
few
strands
of
wool
from
his
jersey
when
night
fell
with
the
suddenness
of
the
tropics
iris
was
able
to
illuminate
her
small
domain
they
were
both
utterly
tired
and
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
the
girl
said
good
night
but
instantly
reappeared
from
behind
the
tarpaulin
am
i
to
keep
the
lamp
alight
she
inquired
please
yourself
miss
deane
better
not
perhaps
it
will
only
burn
four
or
five
hours
any
way
soon
the
light
vanished
and
he
lay
down
his
pipe
between
his
teeth
close
to
the
cave
entrance
weary
though
he
was
he
could
not
sleep
forthwith
his
mind
was
occupied
with
the
signs
on
the
canister
head
divided
by
an
and
a
dot
he
repeated
several
times
what
do
they
signify
suddenly
he
sat
up
with
every
sense
alert
and
grabbed
his
revolver
something
impelled
him
to
look
towards
the
spot
a
few
feet
away
where
the
skeleton
was
hidden
it
was
the
rustling
of
a
bird
among
the
trees
that
had
caught
his
ear
he
thought
of
the
white
framework
of
a
once
powerful
man
lying
there
among
the
bushes
abandoned
forgotten
horrific
then
he
smothered
a
cry
of
surprise
by
jove
he
muttered
there
is
no
and
dot
that
sign
is
meant
for
a
skull
and
it
lies
exactly
on
the
part
of
the
island
where
we
saw
that
bald
patch
today
first
thing
tomorrow
before
the
girl
awakes
i
must
examine
that
place
he
resolutely
stretched
himself
on
his
share
of
the
coats
now
thoroughly
dried
by
sun
and
fire
in
a
minute
he
was
sound
asleep
chapter
v
iris
to
the
rescue
before
mine
eyes
in
opposition
sits
grim
death
he
awoke
to
find
the
sun
high
in
the
heavens
iris
was
preparing
breakfast
a
fine
fire
was
crackling
cheerfully
and
the
presiding
goddess
had
so
altered
her
appearance
that
the
sailor
surveyed
her
with
astonishment
he
noiselessly
assumed
a
sitting
posture
tucked
his
feet
beneath
him
and
blinked
the
girl
face
was
not
visible
from
where
he
sat
and
for
a
few
seconds
he
thought
he
must
surely
be
dreaming
she
was
attired
in
a
neat
dress
and
smart
blouse
her
white
canvas
shoes
were
replaced
by
strong
leather
boots
she
was
quite
spick
and
span
this
island
hebe
so
soundly
had
he
slept
that
his
senses
returned
but
slowly
at
last
he
guessed
what
had
happened
she
had
risen
with
the
dawn
and
conquering
her
natural
feeling
of
repulsion
selected
from
the
store
he
accumulated
yesterday
some
more
suitable
garments
than
those
in
which
she
escaped
from
the
wreck
he
quietly
took
stock
of
his
own
tattered
condition
and
passed
a
reflective
hand
over
the
stubble
on
his
chin
in
a
few
days
his
face
would
resemble
a
in
that
mournful
moment
he
would
have
exchanged
even
his
pipe
and
worth
untold
gold
for
shaving
tackle
who
can
say
why
his
thoughts
took
such
trend
hours
can
effect
great
changes
in
the
human
mind
if
controlling
influences
are
active
then
came
a
sharp
revulsion
of
feeling
his
name
was
robert
a
menial
he
reached
for
his
boots
and
iris
heard
him
good
morning
she
cried
smiling
sweetly
i
thought
you
would
never
awake
i
suppose
you
were
very
very
tired
you
were
lying
so
still
that
i
ventured
to
peep
at
you
a
long
time
ago
thus
might
titania
peep
at
an
ogre
he
said
you
did
look
a
bit
like
an
ogre
you
never
do
you
only
try
to
talk
like
one
sometimes
i
claim
a
truce
until
after
breakfast
if
my
rough
compliment
offends
you
let
me
depend
upon
a
more
gentle
tongue
than
my
own
angel
face
as
the
great
eye
of
heaven
shyned
bright
and
made
a
sunshine
in
the
shady
place
those
lines
are
surely
appropriate
they
come
from
the
they
are
very
nice
but
please
wash
quickly
the
eggs
will
be
hard
eggs
yes
i
made
a
collection
among
the
trees
i
tasted
one
of
a
lot
that
looked
good
it
was
he
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
begin
the
day
with
a
rebuke
she
was
irrepressible
but
she
really
must
not
do
these
things
he
smothered
a
sigh
in
the
improvised
basin
which
was
placed
ready
for
him
miss
deane
had
prepared
a
capital
meal
of
course
the
ham
and
biscuits
still
bulked
large
in
the
bill
of
fare
but
there
were
boiled
eggs
fried
bananas
and
an
elderly
cocoanut
these
things
supplemented
by
clear
cold
water
were
not
so
bad
for
a
couple
of
castaways
hundreds
of
miles
from
everywhere
for
the
life
of
him
the
man
could
not
refrain
from
displaying
the
conversational
art
in
which
he
excelled
their
talk
dealt
with
italy
egypt
india
he
spoke
with
the
ease
of
culture
and
enthusiasm
once
he
slipped
into
anecdote
of
the
helplessness
of
british
soldiers
in
any
matter
outside
the
scope
of
the
king
regulations
i
remember
he
said
seeing
a
cavalry
subaltern
and
the
members
of
an
escort
sitting
half
starved
on
a
number
of
bags
piled
up
in
the
suakin
desert
and
what
do
you
think
were
in
the
bags
i
do
know
said
iris
keenly
alert
for
deductions
biscuits
they
thought
the
bags
contained
patent
fodder
until
i
enlightened
them
it
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
pounce
on
him
with
the
comment
then
you
have
been
an
officer
in
the
army
but
she
forbore
she
had
guessed
this
earlier
yet
the
mischievous
light
in
her
eyes
defied
control
he
was
warned
in
time
and
pulled
himself
up
short
you
read
my
face
like
a
book
she
cried
with
a
delightful
little
no
printed
page
was
ever
so
legible
he
was
going
to
say
fascinating
but
checked
the
impulse
he
went
on
with
brisk
affectation
now
miss
deane
we
have
gossiped
too
long
i
am
a
laggard
this
morning
but
before
starting
work
i
have
a
few
serious
remarks
to
make
more
digs
she
inquired
saucily
i
repudiate
in
the
first
place
you
must
not
make
any
more
experiments
in
the
matter
of
food
the
eggs
were
a
wonderful
effort
but
flattered
by
success
you
may
poison
yourself
secondly
you
must
never
pass
out
of
my
sight
without
carrying
a
revolver
not
so
much
for
defence
but
as
a
signal
did
you
take
one
when
you
went
no
why
there
was
a
troubled
look
in
his
eyes
when
he
answered
it
is
best
to
tell
you
at
once
that
before
help
reaches
us
we
may
be
visited
by
cruel
and
savages
i
would
not
even
mention
this
if
it
were
a
remote
contingency
as
matters
stand
you
ought
to
know
that
such
a
thing
may
happen
let
us
trust
in
god
goodness
that
assistance
may
come
soon
the
island
has
seemingly
been
deserted
for
many
months
and
therein
lies
our
best
chance
of
escape
but
i
am
obliged
to
warn
you
lest
you
should
be
taken
unawares
iris
was
serious
enough
now
how
do
you
know
that
such
danger
threatens
us
she
demanded
he
countered
readily
because
i
happen
to
have
read
a
good
deal
about
the
china
sea
and
its
frequenters
he
said
i
am
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
alarm
you
needlessly
all
i
mean
to
convey
is
that
certain
precautions
should
be
taken
against
a
risk
that
is
possible
not
probable
no
more
she
could
not
repress
a
shudder
the
aspect
of
nature
was
so
beneficent
that
evil
deeds
seemed
to
be
out
of
place
in
that
fair
isle
birds
were
singing
around
them
the
sun
was
mounting
into
a
cloudless
sky
the
gale
had
passed
away
into
a
pleasant
breeze
and
the
sea
was
now
rippling
against
the
distant
reef
with
peaceful
melody
the
sailor
wanted
to
tell
her
that
he
would
defend
her
against
a
host
of
savages
if
he
were
endowed
with
many
lives
but
he
was
perforce
he
even
reviled
himself
for
having
spoken
but
she
saw
the
anguish
in
his
face
and
her
woman
heart
acknowledged
him
as
her
protector
her
shield
jenks
she
said
simply
we
are
in
god
hands
i
put
my
trust
in
him
and
in
you
i
am
hopeful
nay
more
confident
i
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
all
that
you
will
do
if
you
can
not
preserve
me
from
threatening
perils
no
man
could
for
you
are
as
brave
and
gallant
a
gentleman
as
lives
on
the
earth
today
now
the
strange
feature
of
this
extraordinary
and
unexpected
outburst
of
emotion
was
that
the
girl
pronounced
his
name
with
the
slightly
emphasized
accentuation
of
one
who
knew
it
to
be
a
mere
disguise
the
man
was
so
taken
aback
by
her
declaration
of
faith
that
the
minor
incident
though
it
did
not
escape
him
was
smothered
in
a
tumult
of
feeling
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
he
rose
hastily
and
seized
the
axe
to
deliver
a
murderous
assault
upon
a
sago
palm
that
stood
close
at
hand
iris
was
the
first
to
recover
a
degree
of
for
a
moment
she
had
bared
her
soul
with
reaction
came
a
sensitive
shrinking
her
british
temperament
no
less
than
her
delicate
nature
disapproved
these
sentimental
displays
she
wanted
to
box
her
own
ears
with
innate
tact
she
took
a
keen
interest
in
the
felling
of
the
tree
what
do
you
want
it
for
she
inquired
when
the
sturdy
trunk
creaked
and
fell
jenks
felt
better
now
this
is
a
change
of
diet
he
explained
no
we
do
boil
the
leaves
or
nibble
the
bark
when
i
split
this
palm
open
you
will
find
that
the
interior
is
full
of
pith
i
will
cut
it
out
for
you
and
then
it
will
be
your
task
to
knead
it
with
water
after
well
washing
it
pick
out
all
the
fiber
and
finally
permit
the
water
to
evaporate
in
a
couple
of
days
the
residuum
will
become
a
white
powder
which
when
boiled
is
sago
good
gracious
said
iris
the
story
sounds
unconvincing
but
i
believe
i
am
correct
it
is
worth
a
trial
i
should
have
imagined
that
sago
grew
on
a
stalk
like
rice
or
wheat
or
topsy
she
laughed
a
difficult
situation
had
passed
without
undue
effort
unhappily
the
man
reopened
it
whilst
using
a
crowbar
as
a
wedge
he
endeavored
to
put
matters
on
a
straightforward
footing
a
little
while
ago
he
said
you
seemed
to
imply
that
i
had
assumed
the
name
of
jenks
but
miss
deane
confidential
mood
had
gone
nothing
of
the
kind
she
said
coldly
i
think
jenks
is
an
excellent
name
she
regretted
the
words
even
as
they
fell
from
her
lips
the
sailor
gave
a
mighty
wrench
with
the
bar
splitting
the
log
to
its
clustering
leaves
you
are
right
he
said
it
is
distinctive
brief
dogmatic
i
cling
to
it
passionately
soon
afterwards
leaving
iris
to
the
manufacture
of
sago
he
went
to
the
leeward
side
of
the
island
a
search
for
turtles
being
his
ostensible
object
when
the
trees
hid
him
he
quickened
his
pace
and
turned
to
the
left
in
order
to
explore
the
cavity
marked
on
the
tin
with
a
skull
and
to
his
surprise
he
hit
upon
the
remnants
of
a
roadway
that
is
a
line
through
the
wood
where
there
were
no
trees
where
the
ground
bore
traces
of
humanity
in
the
shape
of
a
wrinkled
and
mildewed
pair
of
chinese
boots
a
wooden
sandal
even
the
decayed
remains
of
a
palki
or
litter
at
last
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
the
sight
that
met
his
eyes
held
him
spellbound
the
labor
of
many
hands
had
torn
a
chasm
a
quarry
out
of
the
side
of
the
hill
roughly
circular
in
shape
it
had
a
diameter
of
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
and
at
its
deepest
part
towards
the
cliff
it
ran
to
a
depth
of
forty
feet
on
the
lower
side
where
the
sailor
stood
it
descended
rapidly
for
some
fifteen
feet
grasses
shrubs
plants
of
every
variety
grew
in
profusion
down
the
steep
slopes
wherever
seeds
could
find
precarious
nurture
until
a
point
was
reached
about
ten
or
eleven
feet
from
the
bottom
there
all
vegetation
ceased
as
if
forbidden
to
cross
a
magic
circle
below
this
belt
the
place
was
a
the
bones
of
men
and
animals
mingled
in
weird
confusion
most
were
mere
skeletons
a
few
bodies
nine
the
sailor
counted
yet
preserved
some
resemblance
of
humanity
these
latter
were
scattered
among
the
older
relics
they
wore
the
clothes
of
dyaks
characteristic
hats
and
weapons
denoted
their
nationality
the
others
the
first
harvest
of
this
modern
golgotha
might
have
been
chinese
coolies
when
the
sailor
fascinated
vision
could
register
details
he
distinguished
yokes
baskets
spades
and
picks
strewed
amidst
the
bones
the
animals
were
all
of
one
type
small
lanky
with
long
pointed
skulls
at
last
he
spied
a
withered
hoof
they
were
pigs
over
all
lay
a
thick
coating
of
fine
sand
deposited
from
the
eddying
winds
that
could
never
reach
the
silent
depths
the
place
was
gruesome
horribly
depressing
jenks
broke
out
into
a
clammy
perspiration
he
seemed
to
be
looking
at
the
secrets
of
the
grave
at
last
his
superior
intelligence
asserted
itself
his
brain
became
clearer
recovered
its
power
of
analysis
he
began
to
criticize
reflect
and
this
is
the
theory
he
evolved
some
one
long
ago
had
discovered
valuable
minerals
in
the
volcanic
rock
mining
operations
were
in
full
blast
when
the
extinct
volcano
took
its
revenge
upon
the
human
ants
gnawing
at
its
vitals
and
smothered
them
by
a
deadly
outpouring
of
carbonic
acid
gas
the
poison
of
the
ages
a
horde
of
pigs
running
wild
over
the
island
placed
there
no
doubt
by
chinese
fishers
had
met
the
same
fate
whilst
intent
on
dreadful
orgy
then
there
came
a
european
who
knew
how
the
anhydrate
gas
being
heavier
than
the
surrounding
air
settled
like
water
in
that
terrible
hollow
he
too
had
striven
to
wrest
the
treasure
from
the
stone
by
driving
a
tunnel
into
the
cliff
he
had
partly
succeeded
and
had
gone
away
perhaps
to
obtain
help
after
crudely
registering
his
knowledge
on
the
lid
of
a
tin
canister
this
again
probably
fell
into
the
hands
of
another
man
who
curious
but
unconvinced
caused
himself
to
be
set
ashore
on
this
desolate
spot
with
a
few
inadequate
stores
possibly
he
had
arranged
to
be
taken
off
within
a
fixed
time
but
a
sampan
laden
with
dyak
pirates
came
first
and
the
intrepid
explorer
bones
rested
near
the
well
whilst
his
head
had
gone
to
decorate
the
hut
of
some
fierce
village
chief
the
murderers
after
burying
their
own
dead
for
the
white
man
fought
hard
witness
the
empty
cartridges
searched
the
island
some
of
them
ignorantly
inquisitive
descended
into
the
hollow
they
remained
there
the
others
superstitious
barbarians
fled
for
their
lives
embarking
so
hastily
that
they
took
from
the
cave
neither
tools
nor
oil
though
they
would
greatly
prize
these
articles
such
was
the
tragic
web
he
spun
a
compound
of
fact
and
fancy
it
explained
all
perplexities
save
one
what
did
divided
by
mean
was
there
yet
another
fearsome
riddle
awaiting
solution
and
then
his
thoughts
flew
to
iris
happen
what
might
her
bright
picture
was
seldom
absent
from
his
brain
suppose
she
had
stumbled
across
this
valley
of
death
how
could
he
hope
to
keep
it
hidden
from
her
was
not
the
ghastly
knowledge
better
than
the
horror
of
a
chance
ramble
through
the
wood
and
the
shock
of
discovery
nay
indeed
the
risk
of
a
catastrophe
he
was
a
man
who
relieved
his
surcharged
feelings
with
strong
language
a
habit
of
recent
acquisition
he
indulged
in
it
now
and
felt
better
he
rushed
back
through
the
trees
until
he
caught
sight
of
iris
industriously
kneading
the
sago
pith
in
one
of
those
most
useful
he
called
to
her
led
her
wondering
to
the
track
and
pointed
out
the
fatal
quarry
but
in
such
wise
that
she
could
not
look
inside
it
you
remember
that
round
hole
we
saw
from
the
summit
rock
he
said
well
it
is
full
of
carbonic
acid
gas
to
breathe
which
means
unconsciousness
and
death
it
gives
no
warning
to
the
inexperienced
it
is
rather
pleasant
than
otherwise
promise
me
you
will
never
come
near
this
place
again
now
iris
too
had
been
thinking
deeply
robert
jenks
bulked
large
in
her
her
nerves
were
not
yet
quite
normal
there
was
a
catch
in
her
throat
as
she
answered
i
do
want
to
die
of
course
i
will
keep
away
what
a
horrid
island
this
is
yet
it
might
be
a
paradise
she
bit
her
lip
to
suppress
her
tears
but
being
the
eve
in
this
garden
she
continued
how
did
you
find
out
is
there
anything
nasty
in
there
yes
the
remains
of
animals
and
other
things
i
would
not
have
told
you
were
it
not
imperative
are
you
keeping
other
secrets
from
me
oh
quite
a
number
he
managed
to
conjure
up
a
smile
and
the
ruse
was
effective
she
applied
the
words
to
his
past
history
i
hope
they
will
not
be
revealed
so
dramatically
she
said
you
never
can
tell
he
answered
they
were
in
prophetic
vein
that
morning
they
returned
in
silence
to
the
cave
i
wish
to
go
inside
with
a
lamp
may
i
he
asked
certainly
why
not
he
had
an
odd
trick
of
blushing
this
bronzed
man
with
a
gnarled
soul
he
could
not
frame
a
satisfactory
reply
but
busied
himself
in
refilling
the
lamp
may
i
come
too
she
demanded
he
flung
aside
the
temptation
to
answer
her
in
kind
merely
assenting
with
an
explanation
of
his
design
when
the
lamp
was
in
order
he
held
it
close
to
the
wall
and
conducted
a
systematic
survey
the
geological
fault
which
favored
the
construction
of
the
tunnel
seemed
to
diverge
to
the
left
at
the
further
end
the
face
of
the
rock
exhibited
the
marks
of
persistent
labor
the
stone
had
been
hewn
away
by
main
force
when
the
dislocation
of
strata
ceased
to
be
helpful
his
knowledge
was
limited
on
the
subject
yet
jenks
believed
that
the
material
here
was
a
hard
limestone
rather
than
the
external
basalt
searching
each
inch
with
the
feeble
light
he
paused
once
with
an
exclamation
what
is
it
cried
iris
i
can
not
be
certain
he
said
doubtfully
would
you
mind
holding
the
lamp
whilst
i
use
a
crowbar
in
the
stone
was
visible
a
thin
vein
bluish
white
in
color
he
managed
to
break
off
a
lump
containing
a
specimen
of
the
foreign
metal
they
hurried
into
the
open
air
and
examined
the
fragment
with
curious
eyes
the
sailor
picked
it
with
his
knife
and
the
substance
in
the
vein
came
off
in
laminated
layers
small
brittle
scales
is
it
silver
iris
was
almost
excited
i
do
not
think
so
i
am
no
expert
but
i
have
a
vague
idea
i
have
seen
he
wrinkled
his
brows
and
pressed
away
the
furrows
with
his
hand
that
physical
habit
of
his
when
perplexed
i
have
it
he
cried
it
is
antimony
miss
deane
pursed
her
lips
in
disdain
antimony
what
was
antimony
so
much
fuss
for
nothing
she
said
it
is
used
in
alloys
and
medicines
he
explained
to
us
it
is
useless
he
threw
the
piece
of
rock
contemptuously
among
the
bushes
but
being
thorough
in
all
that
he
undertook
he
returned
to
the
cave
and
again
conducted
an
inquisition
the
vein
became
more
strongly
marked
at
the
point
where
it
disappeared
downwards
into
a
collection
of
rubble
and
sand
that
was
all
did
men
give
their
toil
their
lives
for
this
so
it
would
appear
be
that
as
it
might
he
had
a
more
pressing
work
if
the
cave
still
held
a
secret
it
must
remain
there
iris
had
gone
back
to
her
necessity
had
made
the
lady
a
fifteen
hundred
years
of
philology
bridged
by
circumstance
mused
jenks
how
max
müller
would
have
reveled
in
the
incident
shouldering
the
axe
he
walked
to
the
beach
the
tide
was
low
and
the
circular
sweep
of
the
reef
showed
up
irregularly
its
black
outlines
sticking
out
of
the
vividly
green
water
like
jagged
teeth
much
débris
from
the
steamer
was
lying
high
and
dry
it
was
an
easy
task
for
an
athletic
man
to
reach
the
palm
tree
yet
the
sailor
hesitated
with
almost
imperceptible
qualms
a
baited
he
muttered
then
he
quickened
his
pace
with
the
first
active
spring
from
rock
to
rock
his
unacknowledged
doubts
vanished
he
might
find
stores
of
priceless
utility
the
reflection
inspired
him
jumping
and
climbing
like
a
cat
in
two
minutes
he
was
near
the
tree
he
could
now
see
the
true
explanation
of
its
growth
in
a
seemingly
impossible
place
here
the
bed
of
the
sea
bulged
upwards
in
a
small
sand
cay
which
silted
round
the
base
of
a
limestone
rock
so
different
in
color
and
formation
from
the
coral
reef
nature
whose
engineering
contrivances
can
force
springs
to
mountain
tops
managed
to
deliver
to
this
isolated
refuge
a
sufficient
supply
of
water
to
nourish
the
palm
and
the
roots
firmly
lodged
in
deep
crevices
were
well
protected
from
the
waves
between
the
sailor
and
the
tree
intervened
a
small
stretch
of
shallow
water
landward
this
submerged
saddle
shelved
steeply
into
the
lagoon
although
the
water
in
the
cove
was
twenty
fathoms
in
depth
its
crystal
clearness
was
remarkable
the
bottom
composed
of
marvelously
white
sand
and
broken
coral
rendered
other
objects
conspicuous
he
could
see
plenty
of
fish
but
not
a
single
shark
whilst
on
the
inner
slope
of
the
reef
was
plainly
visible
the
destroyed
fore
part
of
the
which
had
struck
beyond
the
tree
relatively
to
his
present
standpoint
he
had
wondered
why
no
boats
were
cast
ashore
now
he
saw
the
reason
three
of
them
were
still
fastened
to
the
davits
and
carried
down
with
the
hull
seaward
the
water
was
not
so
clear
the
waves
created
patches
of
foam
and
long
submarine
plants
swayed
gently
in
the
undercurrent
to
reach
rock
anticipating
its
subsequent
name
he
must
cross
a
space
of
some
thirty
feet
and
wade
up
to
his
waist
he
made
the
passage
with
ease
pitched
against
the
hole
of
the
tree
was
a
long
narrow
case
very
heavy
and
marked
with
letters
in
black
triangles
and
the
broad
arrow
of
the
british
government
rifles
by
all
the
gods
shouted
the
sailor
they
were
really
by
the
enfield
small
arms
manufactory
but
his
glee
at
this
stroke
of
luck
might
be
held
to
excuse
a
verbal
inaccuracy
the
carried
a
consignment
of
arms
and
ammunition
from
hong
kong
to
singapore
providence
had
decreed
that
a
practically
inexhaustible
store
of
cartridges
should
be
hurled
across
the
lagoon
to
the
island
and
here
were
enough
to
equip
half
a
company
he
would
not
risk
the
precious
axe
in
an
attempt
to
open
the
case
he
must
go
back
for
a
crowbar
what
else
was
there
in
this
storehouse
thrust
by
neptune
from
the
ocean
bed
a
chest
of
tea
seemingly
undamaged
three
barrels
of
flour
utterly
ruined
a
saloon
chair
smashed
from
its
pivot
a
battered
chronometer
for
the
rest
fragments
of
timber
intermingled
with
pulverized
coral
and
broken
crockery
a
little
further
on
the
entrance
to
the
lagoon
curved
between
sunken
rocks
on
one
of
them
rested
the
huge
funnel
the
section
of
the
reef
was
bare
among
the
wreckage
he
found
a
coil
of
stout
rope
and
a
pulley
he
instantly
conceived
the
idea
of
constructing
an
aerial
line
to
ferry
the
chest
of
tea
across
the
channel
he
had
forded
he
threaded
the
pulley
with
the
rope
and
climbed
the
tree
adding
a
touch
of
artistic
completeness
to
the
ruin
of
his
trousers
by
the
operation
he
had
fastened
the
pulley
high
up
the
trunk
before
he
realized
how
much
more
simple
it
would
be
to
break
open
the
chest
where
it
lay
and
transport
its
contents
in
small
parcels
he
laughed
lightly
i
am
becoming
addleheaded
he
said
to
himself
anyhow
now
the
job
is
done
i
may
as
well
make
use
of
it
recoiling
the
he
cast
them
across
to
the
reef
in
such
small
ways
do
men
throw
invisible
dice
with
death
with
those
two
lines
he
would
within
a
few
fleeting
seconds
drag
himself
back
from
eternity
picking
up
the
axe
he
carelessly
stepped
into
the
water
not
knowing
that
iris
having
welded
the
incipient
sago
into
a
flat
pancake
had
strolled
to
the
beach
and
was
watching
him
the
water
was
hardly
above
his
knees
when
there
came
a
swirling
rush
from
the
seaweed
a
long
tentacle
shot
out
like
a
lasso
and
gripped
his
right
leg
another
coiled
round
his
waist
my
god
he
gurgled
as
a
horrid
sucker
closed
over
his
mouth
and
nose
he
was
in
the
grip
of
a
a
deadly
sensation
of
nausea
almost
overpowered
him
but
the
love
of
life
came
to
his
aid
and
he
tore
the
suffocating
feeler
from
his
face
then
the
axe
whirled
and
one
of
the
eight
arms
of
the
octopus
lost
some
of
its
length
yet
a
fourth
flung
itself
around
his
left
ankle
a
few
feet
away
out
of
range
of
the
axe
and
lifting
itself
bodily
out
of
the
water
was
the
dread
form
of
the
cuttle
apparently
all
head
with
distended
gills
and
monstrous
eyes
the
sailor
feet
were
planted
wide
apart
with
frenzied
effort
he
hacked
at
the
murderous
tentacles
but
the
water
hindered
him
and
he
was
forced
to
lean
back
in
superhuman
strain
to
avoid
losing
his
balance
if
once
this
terrible
assailant
got
him
down
he
knew
he
was
lost
the
very
need
to
keep
his
feet
prevented
him
from
attempting
to
deal
a
mortal
blow
the
cuttle
was
anchored
by
three
of
its
tentacles
its
remaining
arm
darted
with
sinuous
activity
to
again
clutch
the
man
face
or
neck
with
the
axe
he
smote
madly
at
the
curling
feeler
diverting
its
aim
time
and
again
but
failing
to
deliver
an
effective
stroke
with
agonized
prescience
the
sailor
knew
that
he
was
yielding
were
the
a
giant
of
its
tribe
he
could
not
have
held
out
so
long
as
it
was
the
creature
could
afford
to
wait
strengthening
its
grasp
tightening
its
coils
pulling
and
pumping
at
its
prey
with
remorseless
certainty
he
was
nearly
spent
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
he
resolved
to
give
way
and
with
one
mad
effort
seek
to
bury
the
axe
in
the
monster
brain
but
ere
he
could
execute
this
fatal
project
for
the
cuttle
would
have
instantly
swept
him
into
the
trailing
weeds
five
revolver
shots
rang
out
in
quick
succession
iris
had
reached
the
nearest
rock
the
third
bullet
gave
the
octopus
cause
to
reflect
it
squirted
forth
a
torrent
of
fluid
instantly
the
water
became
black
opaque
the
tentacle
flourishing
in
air
thrashed
the
surface
with
impotent
fury
that
around
jenks
waist
grew
taut
and
rigid
the
axe
flashed
with
the
inspiration
of
hope
another
arm
was
severed
the
huge
dismembered
coil
slackened
and
fell
away
yet
was
he
anchored
immovably
he
turned
to
look
at
iris
she
never
forgot
the
fleeting
expression
of
his
face
so
might
lazarus
have
looked
from
the
tomb
the
rope
she
screamed
dropping
the
revolver
and
seizing
the
loose
ends
lying
at
her
feet
she
drew
them
tight
and
leaned
back
pulling
with
all
her
strength
the
sailor
flung
the
axe
to
the
rocks
and
grasped
the
two
ropes
he
raised
himself
and
plunged
wildly
he
was
free
with
two
convulsive
strides
he
was
at
the
girl
side
he
stumbled
to
a
boulder
and
dropped
in
complete
collapse
after
a
time
he
felt
iris
hand
placed
timidly
on
his
shoulder
he
raised
his
head
and
saw
her
eyes
shining
thank
you
he
said
we
are
quits
now
chapter
vi
some
explanations
fierce
emotions
are
necessarily
transient
but
for
the
hour
they
exhaust
the
psychic
capacity
the
sailor
had
gone
through
such
mental
stress
before
it
was
yet
noon
that
he
was
benumbed
wholly
incapable
of
further
sensation
seneca
tells
how
the
island
of
theresæa
arose
in
a
moment
from
the
sea
thereby
astounding
ancient
mariners
as
well
it
might
had
this
manifestation
been
repeated
within
a
cable
length
from
the
reef
jenks
was
in
mood
to
accept
it
as
befitting
the
new
order
of
things
being
in
good
condition
he
soon
recovered
his
physical
powers
he
was
outwardly
little
the
worse
for
the
encounter
with
the
the
skin
around
his
mouth
was
sore
his
waist
and
legs
were
bruised
one
sweep
of
the
axe
had
cut
clean
through
the
bulging
leather
of
his
left
boot
without
touching
the
flesh
in
a
word
he
was
practically
uninjured
he
had
the
doglike
habit
of
shaking
himself
at
the
close
of
a
fray
he
did
so
now
when
he
stood
up
iris
showed
clearer
signs
of
the
ordeal
her
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
dilated
she
was
gazing
into
depths
illimitable
unexplored
compassion
awoke
at
sight
of
her
come
said
jenks
gently
let
us
get
back
to
the
island
he
quietly
resumed
predominance
helping
her
over
the
rough
pathway
of
the
reef
almost
lifting
her
when
the
difficulties
were
great
he
did
not
ask
her
how
it
happened
that
she
came
so
speedily
to
his
assistance
enough
that
she
had
done
it
daring
all
for
his
sake
she
was
weak
and
trembling
with
the
acute
vision
of
the
soul
she
saw
again
and
yet
again
the
deadly
malice
of
the
octopus
the
divine
despair
of
the
man
reaching
the
firm
sand
she
could
walk
alone
she
limped
instantly
her
companion
blunted
emotions
quickened
into
life
he
caught
her
arm
and
said
hoarsely
are
you
hurt
in
any
way
the
question
brought
her
back
from
dreamland
a
waking
nightmare
was
happily
shattered
into
dim
fragments
she
even
strove
to
smile
unconcernedly
it
is
nothing
she
murmured
i
stumbled
on
the
rocks
there
is
no
sprain
merely
a
blow
a
bit
of
skin
rubbed
off
above
my
ankle
let
me
carry
you
the
idea
carry
me
i
will
race
you
to
the
cave
it
was
no
idle
jest
she
wanted
to
run
to
get
away
from
that
inky
blotch
in
the
green
water
you
are
sure
it
is
a
trifle
quite
sure
my
stocking
chafes
a
little
that
is
all
see
i
will
show
you
she
stooped
and
with
the
quick
skill
of
woman
rolled
down
the
stocking
on
her
right
leg
modestly
daring
she
stretched
out
her
foot
and
slightly
lifted
her
dress
on
the
outer
side
of
the
tapering
limb
was
an
ugly
bruise
scratched
deeply
by
the
coral
he
exhibited
due
surgical
interest
his
manner
his
words
became
professional
we
will
soon
put
that
right
he
said
a
strip
off
your
muslin
dress
soaked
in
brandy
will
brandy
she
exclaimed
yes
we
have
some
you
know
brandy
is
a
great
tip
for
bruised
wounds
it
can
be
applied
both
ways
inside
and
out
this
was
better
they
were
steadily
drifting
back
to
the
commonplace
whilst
she
stitched
together
some
muslin
strips
he
knocked
the
head
off
a
bottle
of
brandy
they
each
drank
a
small
quantity
and
the
generous
spirit
brought
color
to
their
wan
cheeks
the
sailor
showed
iris
how
to
fasten
a
bandage
by
twisting
the
muslin
round
the
upper
part
of
his
boot
for
the
first
time
she
saw
the
cut
made
by
the
axe
did
the
thing
grip
you
there
she
nervously
inquired
there
and
elsewhere
all
over
at
once
it
felt
like
the
beast
attacked
me
with
five
arms
she
shuddered
i
do
know
how
you
could
fight
it
she
said
how
strong
how
brave
you
must
be
this
amused
him
the
veriest
coward
will
try
to
save
his
own
life
he
answered
if
you
use
such
adjectives
to
me
what
words
can
i
find
to
do
justice
to
you
who
dared
to
come
close
to
such
a
creature
and
kill
it
i
must
thank
my
stars
that
you
carried
the
revolver
ah
she
said
that
reminds
me
you
do
not
practice
what
you
preach
i
found
your
pistol
lying
on
the
stone
in
the
cave
that
is
one
reason
why
i
followed
you
it
was
quite
true
he
laid
the
weapon
aside
when
delving
at
the
rock
and
forgot
to
replace
it
in
his
belt
it
was
stupid
of
me
he
admitted
but
i
am
not
sorry
why
because
as
it
is
i
owe
you
my
life
you
owe
me
nothing
she
snapped
it
is
very
thoughtless
of
you
to
run
such
risks
what
will
become
of
me
if
anything
happens
to
you
my
point
of
view
is
purely
selfish
you
see
quite
so
purely
selfish
he
smiled
sadly
selfish
people
of
your
type
are
somewhat
rare
miss
deane
not
a
conversation
worth
noting
perhaps
save
in
so
far
as
it
is
typical
of
the
trite
utterances
of
people
striving
to
recover
from
some
tremendous
ordeal
epigrams
delivered
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
have
always
been
carefully
prepared
beforehand
the
bandage
was
ready
one
end
was
well
soaked
in
brandy
she
moved
towards
the
cave
but
he
cried
wait
one
minute
i
want
to
get
a
couple
of
crowbars
what
for
i
must
go
back
there
he
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
reef
she
uttered
a
little
sob
of
dismay
i
will
incur
no
danger
this
time
he
explained
i
found
rifles
there
we
must
have
them
they
may
mean
salvation
when
iris
was
determined
about
anything
her
chin
dimpled
it
puckered
delightfully
now
i
will
come
with
you
she
announced
very
well
i
will
wait
for
you
the
tide
will
serve
for
another
hour
he
knew
he
had
decided
rightly
she
could
not
bear
to
be
alone
yet
soon
the
bandage
was
adjusted
and
they
returned
to
the
reef
scrambling
now
with
difficulty
over
the
rough
and
dangerous
track
iris
was
secretly
amazed
by
the
remembrance
of
the
daring
activity
she
displayed
during
her
earlier
passage
along
the
same
precarious
roadway
then
she
darted
from
rock
to
rock
with
the
fearless
certainty
of
a
chamois
her
only
stumble
was
caused
she
recollected
by
an
absurd
effort
to
avoid
wetting
her
dress
she
laughed
nervously
when
they
reached
the
place
this
time
jenks
lifted
her
across
the
intervening
channel
is
this
the
spot
where
you
fell
he
asked
tenderly
yes
how
did
you
guess
it
i
read
it
in
your
eyes
then
please
do
not
read
my
eyes
but
look
where
you
are
going
perhaps
i
was
doing
that
too
he
said
they
were
standing
on
the
landward
side
of
the
shallow
water
in
which
he
fought
the
octopus
already
the
dark
fluid
emitted
by
his
assailant
in
its
final
discomfiture
was
passing
away
owing
to
the
slight
movement
of
the
tide
iris
was
vaguely
conscious
of
a
double
meaning
in
his
words
she
did
not
trouble
to
analyze
them
all
she
knew
was
that
the
man
voice
conveyed
a
subtle
acknowledgment
of
her
feminine
divinity
the
resultant
thrill
of
happiness
startled
even
dismayed
her
this
incipient
flirtation
must
be
put
a
stop
to
instantly
now
that
you
have
brought
me
here
with
so
much
difficulty
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
said
it
will
be
madness
for
you
to
attempt
to
ford
that
passage
again
where
there
is
one
of
those
horrible
things
there
are
others
i
suppose
jenks
smiled
somehow
he
knew
that
this
strict
adherence
to
business
was
a
cloak
for
her
real
thoughts
already
these
two
were
able
to
dispense
with
spoken
word
but
he
sedulously
adopted
her
pretext
that
is
one
reason
why
i
brought
the
crowbars
he
explained
if
you
will
sit
down
for
a
little
while
i
will
have
everything
properly
fixed
he
delved
with
one
of
the
bars
until
it
lodged
in
a
crevice
of
the
coral
then
a
few
powerful
blows
with
the
back
of
the
axe
wedged
it
firmly
enough
to
bear
any
ordinary
strain
the
reeved
through
the
pulley
on
the
tree
were
lying
where
they
fell
from
the
girl
hand
at
the
close
of
the
struggle
he
deftly
knotted
them
to
the
rigid
bar
and
a
few
rapid
turns
of
a
piece
of
wreckage
passed
between
the
two
lines
strung
them
into
a
tautness
that
could
not
be
attained
by
any
amount
of
pulling
iris
watched
the
operation
in
silence
the
sailor
always
looked
at
his
best
when
hard
at
work
the
wholly
expression
left
his
face
which
lit
up
with
enthusiasm
and
concentrated
intelligence
that
which
he
essayed
he
did
with
all
his
might
will
power
and
physical
force
worked
harmoniously
she
had
never
before
seen
such
a
man
at
such
moments
her
admiration
of
him
was
unbounded
he
toiling
with
steady
persistence
felt
not
the
inward
spur
which
sought
relief
in
speech
but
iris
was
compelled
to
say
something
i
suppose
she
commented
with
an
air
of
much
wisdom
you
are
contriving
an
overhead
railway
for
the
safe
transit
of
yourself
and
the
goods
y
yes
why
are
you
so
doubtful
about
it
because
i
personally
intended
to
walk
across
the
ropes
will
serve
to
convey
the
packages
she
rose
imperiously
i
absolutely
forbid
you
to
enter
the
water
again
such
a
suggestion
on
your
part
is
quite
shameful
you
are
taking
a
grave
risk
for
no
very
great
gain
that
i
can
see
and
if
anything
happens
to
you
i
shall
be
left
all
alone
in
this
awful
place
she
could
think
of
no
better
argument
her
only
resource
was
a
expedient
a
plea
for
protection
against
threatening
ills
the
sailor
seemed
to
be
puzzled
how
best
to
act
miss
deane
he
said
there
is
no
such
serious
danger
as
you
imagine
last
time
the
cuttle
caught
me
napping
he
will
not
do
so
again
those
rifles
i
must
have
if
it
will
serve
to
reassure
you
i
will
go
along
the
line
myself
he
made
this
concession
grudgingly
in
very
truth
if
danger
still
lurked
in
the
neighboring
sea
he
would
be
far
less
able
to
avoid
it
whilst
clinging
to
a
rope
that
sagged
with
his
weight
and
thus
working
a
slow
progress
across
the
channel
than
if
he
were
on
his
feet
and
prepared
to
make
a
rush
backwards
or
forwards
not
until
iris
watched
him
swinging
along
with
vigorous
overhead
clutches
did
this
phase
of
the
undertaking
occur
to
her
stop
she
screamed
he
let
go
and
dropped
into
the
water
turning
towards
her
what
is
the
matter
now
he
said
go
on
do
he
stood
meekly
on
the
further
side
to
listen
to
her
rating
you
knew
all
the
time
that
it
would
be
better
to
walk
yet
to
please
me
you
adopted
an
absurdly
difficult
method
why
did
you
do
it
you
have
answered
your
own
question
well
i
am
very
very
angry
with
you
i
tell
you
what
he
said
if
you
will
forgive
me
i
will
try
and
jump
back
i
once
did
nineteen
feet
three
inches
in
er
in
a
meadow
but
it
makes
such
a
difference
when
you
look
at
a
stretch
of
water
the
same
width
i
wish
you
would
not
stand
there
talking
nonsense
the
tide
will
be
over
the
reef
in
half
an
hour
she
cried
without
another
word
he
commenced
operations
there
was
plenty
of
rope
and
the
plan
he
adopted
was
simplicity
itself
when
each
package
was
securely
fastened
he
attached
it
to
a
loop
that
passed
over
the
line
stretched
from
the
tree
to
the
crowbar
to
this
loop
he
tied
the
lightest
rope
he
could
find
and
threw
the
other
end
to
iris
by
pulling
slightly
she
was
able
to
land
at
her
feet
even
the
cumbrous
for
the
traveling
angle
was
so
acute
that
the
heavier
the
article
the
more
readily
it
sought
the
lower
level
they
toiled
in
silence
until
jenks
could
lay
hands
on
nothing
more
of
value
then
observing
due
care
he
quickly
passed
the
channel
for
an
instant
the
girl
gazed
affrightedly
at
the
sea
until
the
sailor
stood
at
her
side
again
you
see
he
said
you
have
scared
every
cuttle
within
miles
and
he
thought
that
he
would
give
many
years
of
his
life
to
be
able
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
away
her
anxiety
but
the
tide
had
turned
in
a
few
minutes
the
reef
would
be
partly
submerged
to
carry
the
case
of
rifles
to
the
mainland
was
a
manifestly
impossible
feat
so
jenks
now
did
that
which
done
earlier
would
have
saved
him
some
labor
he
broke
open
the
chest
and
found
that
the
weapons
were
apparently
in
excellent
order
he
snapped
the
locks
and
squinted
down
the
barrels
of
half
a
dozen
to
test
them
these
he
laid
on
one
side
then
he
rapidly
constructed
a
small
raft
from
loose
timbers
binding
them
roughly
with
rope
and
to
this
argosy
he
fastened
the
box
of
tea
the
barrels
of
flour
the
broken
and
other
small
articles
which
might
be
of
use
he
avoided
any
difficulty
in
launching
the
raft
by
building
it
close
to
the
water
edge
when
all
was
ready
the
rising
tide
floated
it
for
him
he
secured
it
to
his
longest
rope
and
gave
it
a
vigorous
push
off
into
the
lagoon
then
he
slung
four
rifles
across
his
shoulders
asked
iris
to
carry
the
remaining
two
in
like
manner
and
began
to
manoeuvre
the
raft
landwards
whilst
you
land
the
goods
i
will
prepare
dinner
announced
the
girl
please
be
careful
not
to
slip
again
on
the
rocks
he
said
indeed
i
will
my
ankle
gives
me
a
reminder
at
each
step
i
was
more
concerned
about
the
rifles
if
you
fell
you
might
damage
them
and
the
incoming
tide
will
so
hopelessly
rust
those
i
leave
behind
that
they
will
be
useless
she
laughed
this
assumption
at
brutality
no
longer
deceived
her
i
will
preserve
them
at
any
cost
though
with
six
in
our
possession
there
is
a
margin
for
accidents
however
to
reassure
you
i
will
go
back
quickly
if
i
fall
a
second
time
you
will
still
be
able
to
replace
any
deficiencies
in
our
armament
before
he
could
protest
she
started
off
at
a
run
jumping
lightly
from
rock
to
rock
though
the
effort
cost
her
a
good
deal
of
pain
disregarding
his
shouts
she
persevered
until
she
stood
safely
on
the
sands
then
saucily
waving
a
farewell
she
set
off
towards
the
cave
had
she
seen
the
look
of
fierce
despair
that
settled
down
upon
face
as
he
turned
to
his
task
of
guiding
the
raft
ashore
she
might
have
wondered
what
it
meant
in
any
case
she
would
certainly
have
behaved
differently
by
the
time
the
sailor
had
safely
landed
his
cargo
iris
had
cooked
their
midday
meal
she
achieved
a
fresh
culinary
triumph
the
eggs
were
fried
i
am
seriously
thinking
of
trying
to
boil
a
ham
she
stated
gravely
have
you
any
idea
how
long
it
takes
to
cook
one
properly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
each
pound
admirable
but
we
can
measure
neither
hours
nor
pounds
i
think
we
can
do
both
i
will
construct
a
balance
of
some
kind
then
with
a
ham
slung
to
one
end
and
a
rifle
and
some
cartridges
to
the
other
i
will
tell
you
the
weight
of
the
ham
to
an
ounce
to
ascertain
the
time
i
have
already
determined
to
fashion
a
i
remember
the
requisite
divisions
with
reasonable
accuracy
and
a
little
observation
will
enable
us
to
correct
any
mistakes
you
are
really
very
clever
jenks
said
iris
with
childlike
candor
have
you
spent
several
years
of
your
life
in
preparing
for
residence
on
a
desert
island
something
of
the
sort
i
have
led
a
queer
kind
of
existence
full
of
useless
purposes
fate
has
driven
me
into
a
corner
where
my
odds
and
ends
of
knowledge
are
actually
valuable
such
accidents
make
men
millionaires
useless
purposes
she
repeated
i
can
hardly
credit
that
one
uses
such
a
phrase
to
describe
fussy
people
alive
with
foolish
activity
your
worst
enemy
would
not
place
you
in
such
a
category
my
worst
enemy
made
the
phrase
effective
at
any
rate
miss
deane
you
mean
that
he
ruined
your
career
well
er
yes
i
suppose
that
describes
the
position
with
fair
accuracy
was
he
a
very
great
scoundrel
he
was
and
is
jenks
spoke
with
quiet
bitterness
the
girl
words
had
evoked
a
sudden
flood
of
recollection
for
the
moment
he
did
not
notice
how
he
had
been
trapped
into
speaking
of
himself
nor
did
he
see
the
quiet
content
on
iris
face
when
she
elicited
the
information
that
his
chief
foe
was
a
man
a
certain
tremulous
hesitancy
in
her
manner
when
she
next
spoke
might
have
warned
him
but
his
hungry
soul
caught
only
the
warm
sympathy
of
her
words
which
fell
like
rain
on
parched
soil
you
are
tired
she
said
wo
you
smoke
for
a
little
while
and
talk
to
me
he
produced
his
pipe
and
tobacco
but
he
used
his
right
hand
awkwardly
it
was
evident
to
her
alert
eyes
that
the
torn
quick
on
his
injured
finger
was
hurting
him
a
great
deal
the
exciting
events
of
the
morning
had
caused
him
temporarily
to
forget
his
wound
and
the
rapid
coursing
of
the
blood
through
the
veins
was
now
causing
him
agonized
throbs
with
a
cry
of
distress
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
insisted
upon
washing
the
wound
then
she
tenderly
dressed
it
with
a
strip
of
linen
well
soaked
in
brandy
thinking
the
while
with
a
sudden
rush
of
color
to
her
face
that
although
he
could
suggest
this
remedy
for
her
slight
hurt
he
gave
no
thought
to
his
own
serious
injury
finally
she
pounced
upon
his
pipe
and
do
be
alarmed
she
laughed
i
have
often
filled
my
father
pipe
for
him
first
you
put
the
tobacco
in
loosely
taking
care
not
to
use
any
that
is
too
finely
powdered
then
you
pack
the
remainder
quite
tightly
but
i
was
nearly
forgetting
i
have
blown
through
the
pipe
to
see
if
it
is
clean
she
suited
the
action
to
the
word
using
much
needless
breath
in
the
operation
that
is
a
pipe
she
declared
my
father
always
said
that
a
straight
stem
with
the
bowl
at
a
right
angle
was
the
correct
shape
you
evidently
agree
with
him
absolutely
you
will
like
my
father
when
you
meet
him
he
is
the
very
best
man
alive
i
am
sure
you
two
are
great
friends
then
great
friends
he
is
the
only
friend
i
possess
in
the
world
what
is
that
quite
accurate
oh
quite
of
course
jenks
i
can
never
forget
how
much
i
owe
to
you
i
like
you
immensely
too
although
you
are
so
so
gruff
to
me
at
times
but
but
you
see
my
father
and
i
have
always
been
together
i
have
neither
brother
nor
sister
not
even
a
cousin
my
dear
mother
died
from
some
horrid
fever
when
i
was
quite
a
little
girl
my
father
is
everything
to
me
dear
child
he
murmured
apparently
uttering
his
thoughts
aloud
rather
than
addressing
her
directly
so
you
find
me
gruff
eh
a
regular
bear
when
you
lecture
me
but
that
is
only
occasionally
you
can
be
very
nice
when
you
like
when
you
forget
your
past
troubles
and
pray
why
do
you
call
me
a
child
have
i
done
so
not
a
moment
ago
how
old
are
you
jenks
i
am
twenty
twenty
last
december
and
i
he
said
will
be
in
august
good
gracious
she
gasped
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
really
thought
you
were
forty
at
least
i
look
it
no
doubt
let
me
be
equally
candid
and
admit
that
you
too
show
your
age
markedly
she
smiled
nervously
what
a
lot
of
trouble
you
must
have
had
to
to
to
give
you
those
little
wrinkles
in
the
corners
of
your
mouth
and
eyes
she
said
wrinkles
how
terrible
i
do
know
i
think
they
rather
suit
you
besides
it
was
stupid
of
me
to
imagine
you
were
so
old
i
suppose
exposure
to
the
sun
creates
wrinkles
and
you
must
have
lived
much
in
the
open
air
early
rising
and
late
going
to
bed
are
bad
for
the
complexion
he
declared
solemnly
i
often
wonder
how
army
officers
manage
to
exist
she
said
they
never
seem
to
get
enough
sleep
in
the
east
at
any
rate
i
have
seen
them
dancing
for
hours
after
midnight
and
heard
of
them
or
schooling
hunters
at
five
next
morning
so
you
assume
i
have
been
in
the
army
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
may
i
ask
why
your
manner
your
voice
your
quiet
air
of
authority
the
very
way
you
walk
all
betray
you
then
he
said
sadly
i
will
not
attempt
to
deny
the
fact
i
held
a
commission
in
the
indian
staff
corps
for
nine
years
it
was
a
hobby
of
mine
miss
deane
to
make
myself
acquainted
with
the
best
means
of
victualing
my
men
and
keeping
them
in
good
health
under
all
sorts
of
fanciful
conditions
and
in
every
kind
of
climate
especially
under
circumstances
when
ordinary
stores
were
not
available
with
that
object
in
view
i
read
up
every
possible
country
in
which
my
regiment
might
be
engaged
learnt
the
local
names
of
common
articles
of
food
and
ascertained
particularly
what
provision
nature
made
to
sustain
life
the
study
interested
me
once
during
the
soudan
campaign
it
was
really
useful
and
procured
me
promotion
tell
me
about
it
during
some
operations
in
the
desert
it
was
necessary
for
my
troop
to
follow
up
a
small
party
of
rebels
mounted
on
camels
which
as
you
probably
know
can
go
without
water
much
longer
than
horses
we
were
almost
within
striking
distance
when
our
horses
completely
gave
out
but
i
luckily
noticed
indications
which
showed
that
there
was
water
beneath
a
portion
of
the
plain
much
below
the
general
level
half
an
hour
spade
work
proved
that
i
was
right
we
took
up
the
pursuit
again
and
ran
the
quarry
to
earth
and
i
got
my
captaincy
was
there
no
fight
he
paused
an
appreciable
time
before
replying
then
he
evidently
made
up
his
mind
to
perform
some
disagreeable
task
the
watching
girl
could
see
the
change
in
his
face
the
sharp
transition
from
eager
interest
to
angry
resentment
yes
he
went
on
at
last
there
was
a
fight
it
was
a
rather
stiff
affair
because
a
troop
of
british
cavalry
which
should
have
supported
me
had
turned
back
owing
to
the
want
of
water
already
mentioned
but
that
did
not
save
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
lancers
from
being
severely
reprimanded
the
lancers
cried
iris
lord
ventnor
regiment
lord
ventnor
was
the
officer
in
question
her
face
crimonsed
then
you
know
him
she
said
i
do
is
he
your
enemy
yes
and
that
is
why
you
were
so
agitated
that
last
day
on
the
when
poor
lady
tozer
asked
me
if
i
were
engaged
to
him
yes
how
could
it
affect
you
you
did
not
even
know
my
name
then
poor
iris
she
did
not
stop
to
ask
herself
why
she
framed
her
question
in
such
manner
but
the
sailor
was
now
too
profoundly
moved
to
heed
the
slip
she
could
not
tell
how
he
was
fighting
with
himself
fiercely
beating
down
the
inner
barriers
of
sternly
determined
once
and
for
all
to
reveal
himself
in
such
light
to
this
beautiful
and
bewitching
woman
that
in
future
she
would
learn
to
regard
him
only
as
an
outcast
whose
company
she
must
perforce
tolerate
until
relief
came
it
affected
me
because
the
sudden
mention
of
his
name
recalled
my
own
disgrace
i
quitted
the
army
six
months
ago
miss
deane
under
very
painful
circumstances
a
general
found
me
guilty
of
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
i
was
not
even
given
a
chance
to
resign
i
was
cashiered
he
pretended
to
speak
with
cool
truculence
he
thought
to
compel
her
into
shrinking
contempt
yet
his
face
blanched
somewhat
and
though
he
steadily
kept
the
pipe
between
his
teeth
and
smoked
with
studied
unconcern
his
lips
twitched
a
little
and
he
dared
not
look
at
her
for
the
girl
wondering
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
and
the
blush
had
disappeared
as
quickly
as
it
came
i
remember
something
of
this
she
said
slowly
never
once
averting
her
gaze
there
was
some
gossip
concerning
it
when
i
first
came
to
hong
kong
you
are
captain
robert
anstruther
i
am
and
you
publicly
thrashed
lord
ventnor
as
the
result
of
a
quarrel
about
a
woman
your
recollection
is
quite
accurate
who
was
to
blame
the
lady
said
that
i
was
was
it
true
robert
anstruther
late
captain
of
bengal
cavalry
rose
to
his
feet
he
preferred
to
take
his
punishment
standing
the
agreed
with
her
miss
deane
and
i
am
a
prejudiced
witness
he
replied
who
was
the
lady
the
wife
of
my
colonel
mrs
costobell
oh
long
afterwards
he
remembered
the
agony
of
that
moment
and
winced
even
at
the
remembrance
but
he
had
decided
upon
a
fixed
policy
and
he
was
not
a
man
to
flinch
from
consequences
miss
deane
must
be
taught
to
despise
him
else
god
help
them
both
she
might
learn
to
love
him
as
he
now
loved
her
so
blundering
towards
his
goal
as
men
always
blunder
where
a
woman
heart
is
concerned
he
blindly
persisted
in
allowing
her
to
make
such
false
deductions
as
she
chose
from
his
words
iris
was
the
first
to
regain
some
measure
of
i
am
glad
you
have
been
so
candid
captain
anstruther
she
commenced
but
he
broke
in
abruptly
jenks
if
you
please
miss
deane
robert
jenks
there
was
a
curious
light
in
her
eyes
but
he
did
not
see
it
and
her
voice
was
marvelously
subdued
as
she
continued
certainly
jenks
let
me
be
equally
explicit
before
we
quit
the
subject
i
have
met
costobell
i
do
not
like
her
i
consider
her
a
deceitful
woman
your
might
have
found
a
different
verdict
had
its
members
been
of
her
sex
as
for
lord
ventnor
he
is
nothing
to
me
it
is
true
he
asked
my
father
to
be
permitted
to
pay
his
addresses
to
me
but
my
dear
old
dad
left
the
matter
wholly
to
my
decision
and
i
certainly
never
gave
lord
ventnor
any
encouragement
i
believe
now
that
costobell
lied
and
that
lord
ventnor
lied
when
they
attributed
any
dishonorable
action
to
you
and
i
am
glad
that
you
beat
him
in
the
club
i
am
quite
sure
he
deserved
it
not
one
word
did
this
strange
man
vouchsafe
in
reply
he
started
violently
seized
the
axe
lying
at
his
feet
and
went
straight
among
the
trees
keeping
his
face
turned
from
iris
so
that
she
might
not
see
the
tears
in
his
eyes
as
for
the
girl
she
began
to
scour
her
cooking
utensils
with
much
energy
and
soon
commenced
a
song
considering
that
she
was
compelled
to
constantly
endure
the
company
of
a
degraded
officer
who
had
been
expelled
from
the
service
with
ignominy
she
was
absurdly
contented
indeed
with
the
happy
inconsequence
of
youth
she
quickly
threw
all
care
to
the
winds
and
devoted
her
thoughts
to
planning
a
surprise
for
the
next
day
by
preparing
some
tea
provided
she
could
surreptitiously
open
the
chest
chapter
vii
surprises
before
night
closed
their
third
day
on
the
island
jenks
managed
to
construct
a
roomy
with
a
framework
of
sturdy
trees
selected
on
account
of
their
location
to
these
he
nailed
or
tied
crossbeams
of
felled
saplings
and
the
tarpaulins
dragged
from
the
beach
supplied
roof
and
walls
it
required
the
united
strength
of
iris
and
himself
to
haul
into
position
the
heavy
sheet
that
topped
the
structure
whilst
he
was
compelled
to
desist
from
active
building
operations
in
order
to
fashion
a
rough
ladder
without
some
such
contrivance
he
could
not
get
the
topmost
supports
adjusted
at
a
sufficient
height
although
the
edifice
required
at
least
two
more
days
of
hard
work
before
it
would
be
fit
for
habitation
iris
wished
to
take
up
her
quarters
there
immediately
this
the
sailor
would
not
hear
of
in
the
cave
he
said
you
are
absolutely
sheltered
from
all
the
winds
that
blow
or
rain
that
falls
our
villa
however
is
painfully
leaky
and
draughty
at
present
when
asleep
the
whole
body
is
relaxed
and
you
are
then
most
open
to
the
attacks
of
cold
or
fever
in
which
case
miss
deane
i
shall
be
reluctantly
obliged
to
dose
you
with
a
concoction
of
that
tree
there
he
pointed
to
a
neighboring
cinchona
and
iris
naturally
asked
why
he
selected
that
particular
brand
because
it
is
quinine
not
made
up
in
nice
little
tabloids
but
it
will
not
be
a
bad
plan
if
we
prepare
a
strong
infusion
and
take
a
small
quantity
every
morning
on
the
excellent
principle
that
prevention
is
better
than
cure
the
girl
laughed
good
gracious
she
said
that
reminds
me
but
the
words
died
away
on
her
lips
in
sudden
fright
they
were
standing
on
the
level
plateau
in
front
of
the
cave
well
removed
from
the
trees
and
they
could
see
distinctly
on
all
sides
for
the
sun
was
sinking
in
a
cloudless
sky
and
the
air
was
preternaturally
clear
being
free
now
from
the
tremulous
haze
of
the
hot
hours
across
the
smooth
expanse
of
sandy
ground
came
the
agonized
shrieks
of
a
startled
bird
a
large
bird
it
would
seem
winging
its
way
towards
them
with
incredible
swiftness
and
uttering
a
succession
of
loud
notes
of
alarm
yet
the
strange
thing
was
that
not
a
bird
was
to
be
seen
at
that
hour
the
ordinary
feathered
inhabitants
of
the
island
were
quietly
nestling
among
the
branches
preparatory
to
making
a
final
selection
of
the
night
none
of
them
would
stir
unless
actually
disturbed
iris
drew
near
to
the
sailor
involuntarily
she
caught
his
arm
he
stepped
a
in
front
of
her
to
ward
off
any
danger
that
might
be
heralded
by
this
new
and
uncanny
phenomenon
together
they
strained
their
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
approaching
sound
but
apparently
their
sight
was
bewitched
as
nothing
whatever
was
visible
oh
what
is
it
wailed
iris
who
now
clung
to
jenks
in
a
state
of
great
apprehension
the
clucking
noise
came
nearer
passed
them
within
a
yard
and
was
already
some
distance
away
towards
the
reef
when
the
sailor
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
none
the
less
genuine
because
of
the
relief
it
gave
to
his
bewildered
senses
reassured
but
still
white
with
fear
iris
cried
do
speak
please
jenks
what
was
it
a
beetle
he
managed
to
gasp
a
beetle
yes
a
small
fellow
too
so
small
that
i
did
not
see
him
until
he
was
almost
out
of
range
he
has
the
loudest
voice
for
his
size
in
the
whole
of
creation
a
man
able
to
shout
on
the
same
scale
could
easily
make
himself
heard
for
twenty
miles
then
i
do
not
like
such
beetles
i
always
hated
them
but
this
latest
variety
is
positively
detestable
such
nasty
things
ought
to
be
kept
in
zoological
gardens
and
not
turned
loose
moreover
my
tea
will
be
boiled
into
spinach
nevertheless
the
tea
though
minus
sugar
or
milk
was
grateful
enough
and
particularly
acceptable
to
the
sailor
who
entertained
iris
with
a
disquisition
on
the
many
virtues
of
that
marvelous
beverage
curiously
enough
the
lifting
of
the
veil
upon
the
man
earlier
history
made
these
two
much
better
friends
with
more
complete
acquaintance
there
was
far
less
tendency
towards
certain
passages
which
under
ordinary
conditions
could
be
construed
as
nothing
else
than
downright
flirtation
they
made
the
pleasing
discovery
that
they
could
both
sing
there
was
hardly
an
opera
in
vogue
that
one
or
other
did
not
know
sufficiently
well
to
be
able
to
recall
the
chief
musical
numbers
iris
had
a
sweet
and
sympathetic
voice
jenks
an
excellent
baritone
and
to
the
secret
amazement
of
the
girl
he
rendered
one
or
two
ditties
with
much
humor
this
then
was
the
iris
seated
in
the
broken
which
the
sailor
had
firmly
wedged
into
the
sand
for
her
accommodation
was
attired
in
a
costume
selected
from
the
small
store
of
garments
so
wisely
preserved
by
jenks
she
wore
a
pair
of
clumsy
men
boots
several
sizes
too
large
for
her
her
hair
was
tied
up
in
a
gipsy
knot
on
the
back
of
her
head
and
the
light
of
a
cheerful
log
fire
danced
in
her
blue
eyes
jenks
unshaven
and
ragged
squatted
tailor
wise
near
her
close
at
hand
on
two
sides
the
shaggy
walls
of
rock
rose
in
solemn
grandeur
the
neighboring
trees
decked
now
in
the
sable
livery
of
night
were
dimly
outlined
against
the
deep
misty
blue
of
sea
and
sky
or
wholly
merged
in
the
shadow
of
the
cliffs
they
lost
themselves
in
the
peaceful
influences
of
the
hour
shipwrecked
remote
from
human
land
environed
by
dangers
known
or
only
conjectured
two
solitary
beings
on
a
tiny
island
thrown
haphazard
from
the
depths
of
the
china
sea
this
young
couple
after
passing
unscathed
through
perils
unknown
even
to
the
writers
of
melodrama
lifted
up
their
voices
in
the
sheer
exuberance
of
good
spirits
and
abounding
vitality
the
girl
was
specially
attracted
by
the
buffalo
battery
a
rollicking
lyric
known
to
all
from
peshawur
to
tuticorin
the
air
is
the
familiar
one
of
the
hen
convention
and
the
opening
verse
runs
in
this
wise
i
love
to
hear
the
sepoy
with
his
bold
and
martial
tread
and
the
thud
of
the
galloping
cavalry
through
my
head
but
sweeter
far
than
any
sound
by
mortal
ever
made
is
the
tramp
of
the
buffalo
battery
to
parade
for
it
hainya
hainya
hainya
hainya
twist
their
tails
and
go
with
a
hâthi
hâthi
hâthi
and
tèri
ma
oh
that
the
way
they
shout
all
day
and
drive
the
buffalo
iris
would
not
be
satisfied
until
she
understood
the
meaning
of
the
hindustani
phrases
mastered
the
nasal
pronunciation
of
hainya
and
placed
the
artificial
accent
on
and
in
the
second
line
of
the
chorus
jenks
was
concluding
the
last
verse
when
there
came
hurtling
through
the
air
the
weird
cries
of
the
singing
beetle
returning
perchance
from
successful
foray
on
rock
this
second
advent
of
the
insect
put
an
end
to
the
concert
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
were
asleep
thenceforth
for
ten
days
they
labored
unceasingly
starting
work
at
daybreak
and
stopping
only
when
the
light
failed
finding
the
long
hours
of
sunshine
all
too
short
for
the
manifold
tasks
demanded
of
them
yet
thankful
that
the
night
brought
rest
the
sailor
made
out
a
programme
to
which
he
rigidly
adhered
in
the
first
place
he
completed
the
house
which
had
two
compartments
an
inner
room
in
which
iris
slept
and
an
outer
which
served
as
a
shelter
for
their
meals
and
provided
a
bedroom
for
the
man
then
he
constructed
a
gigantic
on
summit
rock
the
small
cluster
of
boulders
on
top
of
the
cliff
his
chief
difficulty
was
to
hoist
into
place
the
tall
poles
he
needed
and
for
this
purpose
he
had
to
again
visit
rock
in
order
to
secure
the
pulley
by
exercising
much
ingenuity
in
devising
he
at
last
succeeded
in
lifting
the
masts
into
their
allotted
receptacles
where
they
were
firmly
secured
finally
he
was
able
to
swing
into
air
high
above
the
tops
of
the
neighboring
trees
the
loftiest
of
which
he
felled
in
order
to
clear
the
view
on
all
sides
the
name
of
the
ship
fashioned
in
letters
nailed
and
spliced
together
in
sections
and
made
from
the
timbers
of
that
vessel
meanwhile
he
taught
iris
how
to
weave
a
net
out
of
the
strands
of
unraveled
cordage
with
this
weighted
by
bullets
he
contrived
a
and
caught
a
lot
of
small
fish
in
the
lagoon
at
first
they
were
unable
to
decide
which
varieties
were
edible
until
a
happy
expedient
occurred
to
the
girl
the
seabirds
can
tell
us
she
said
let
us
spread
out
our
haul
on
the
sands
and
leave
them
by
observing
those
specimens
seized
by
the
birds
and
those
they
reject
we
should
not
go
far
wrong
though
her
reasoning
was
not
infallible
it
certainly
proved
to
be
a
reliable
guide
in
this
instance
among
the
fish
selected
by
the
feathered
connoisseurs
they
hit
upon
two
species
which
most
resembled
whiting
and
haddock
and
these
turned
out
to
be
very
palatable
and
wholesome
jenks
knew
a
good
deal
of
botany
and
enough
about
birds
to
differentiate
between
carnivorous
species
and
those
fit
for
human
food
whilst
the
salt
in
their
most
fortunate
supply
of
hams
rendered
their
meals
almost
epicurean
think
of
it
ye
dwellers
in
cities
content
with
stale
buns
and
leathery
sandwiches
when
ye
venture
into
the
wilds
of
a
railway
these
two
castaways
marooned
by
queer
chance
on
a
desert
island
could
sit
down
daily
to
a
banquet
of
vegetable
soup
fish
a
roast
bird
ham
boiled
or
fried
and
a
sago
pudding
the
whole
washed
down
by
cool
spring
water
or
should
the
need
arise
a
draught
of
the
best
champagne
from
the
rusty
rifles
on
the
reef
jenks
brought
away
the
bayonets
and
secured
all
the
screws
bolts
and
other
small
odds
and
ends
which
might
be
serviceable
from
the
barrels
he
built
a
handy
grate
to
facilitate
iris
cooking
operations
and
a
careful
search
each
morning
amidst
the
ashes
of
any
burnt
wreckage
accumulated
a
store
of
most
useful
nails
the
pressing
need
for
a
safe
yet
accessible
bathing
place
led
him
and
the
girl
to
devote
one
afternoon
to
a
complete
survey
of
the
by
this
time
they
had
given
names
to
all
the
chief
localities
the
northerly
promontory
was
naturally
christened
north
cape
the
western
europa
point
the
portion
of
the
reef
between
their
habitation
and
rock
became
filey
brig
the
other
section
reef
the
flat
sandy
passage
across
the
island
containing
the
cave
house
and
well
was
named
prospect
park
and
the
extensive
stretch
of
sand
on
the
with
its
guard
of
broken
reefs
was
at
once
dubbed
turtle
beach
when
jenks
discovered
that
an
immense
number
of
green
turtles
were
paying
their
spring
visit
to
the
island
to
bury
their
eggs
in
the
sand
the
two
began
their
tour
of
inspection
by
passing
the
scene
of
the
first
desperate
struggle
to
escape
from
the
clutch
of
the
typhoon
iris
would
not
be
content
until
the
sailor
showed
her
the
rock
behind
which
he
placed
her
for
shelter
whilst
he
searched
for
water
for
a
moment
the
recollection
of
their
unfortunate
companions
on
board
ship
brought
a
lump
into
her
throat
and
dimmed
her
eyes
i
remember
them
in
my
prayers
every
night
she
confided
to
him
it
seems
so
unutterably
sad
that
they
should
be
lost
whilst
we
are
alive
and
happy
the
man
distracted
her
attention
by
pointing
out
the
embers
of
their
first
fire
it
was
the
only
way
to
choke
back
the
tumultuous
feelings
that
suddenly
stormed
his
heart
happy
yes
he
had
never
before
known
such
happiness
how
long
would
it
last
high
up
on
the
cliff
swung
the
signal
to
anxious
searchers
of
the
sea
that
here
would
be
found
the
survivors
of
the
and
then
when
rescue
came
when
miss
deane
became
once
more
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
baronet
and
he
a
disgraced
and
a
nameless
outcast
he
set
his
teeth
and
savagely
struck
at
a
full
cup
of
the
which
had
so
providentially
relieved
their
killing
thirst
oh
why
did
you
do
that
pouted
iris
poor
thing
it
was
a
true
friend
in
need
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
it
to
make
it
the
best
and
leafiest
plant
of
its
kind
on
the
island
very
well
he
answered
you
can
gratify
your
wish
a
tinful
of
fresh
water
from
the
well
applied
daily
to
its
roots
will
quickly
achieve
that
end
the
moroseness
of
his
tone
and
manner
surprised
her
for
once
her
quick
intuition
failed
to
divine
the
source
of
his
irritation
you
give
your
advice
ungraciously
she
said
but
i
will
adopt
it
nevertheless
a
harmless
incident
a
kindly
and
quite
feminine
resolve
yet
big
with
fate
for
both
of
them
jenks
unwonted
for
the
passage
of
days
had
driven
from
his
face
all
its
harshness
and
from
his
tongue
all
its
assumed
bitterness
created
a
passing
cloud
until
the
physical
exertion
of
scrambling
over
the
rocks
to
round
the
north
cape
restored
their
normal
relations
a
strong
current
raced
by
this
point
to
the
and
tore
away
the
outlying
spur
of
the
headland
to
such
an
extent
that
the
sailor
was
almost
inclined
to
choose
the
easier
way
through
the
trees
yet
he
persevered
and
it
may
be
confessed
that
the
opportunities
thus
afforded
of
grasping
the
girl
arm
of
placing
a
steadying
hand
on
her
shoulder
were
dominant
factors
in
determining
his
choice
at
last
they
reached
the
south
side
and
here
they
at
once
found
themselves
in
a
delightfully
secluded
and
tiny
bay
sandy
sheltered
on
three
sides
by
cliffs
and
rocks
oh
cried
iris
excitedly
what
a
lovely
spot
a
perfect
cove
charming
enough
to
look
at
was
the
answering
comment
but
open
to
the
sea
if
you
look
at
the
smooth
riband
of
water
out
there
you
will
perceive
a
passage
through
the
reef
a
great
place
for
sharks
miss
deane
but
no
place
for
bathers
good
gracious
i
had
forgotten
the
sharks
i
suppose
they
must
live
horrid
as
they
are
but
i
do
want
them
to
dine
on
me
the
mention
of
such
disagreeable
adjuncts
to
life
on
the
island
no
longer
terrified
her
thus
do
english
to
india
pass
the
first
three
months
residence
in
the
country
in
momentary
terror
of
snakes
and
the
remaining
thirty
years
in
complete
forgetfulness
of
them
they
passed
on
whilst
traversing
the
south
beach
with
its
patches
of
white
soft
sand
baking
in
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
jenks
perceived
traces
of
the
turtle
which
swarmed
in
the
neighboring
sea
delicious
eggs
and
turtle
soup
he
announced
when
iris
asked
him
why
he
was
so
intently
studying
certain
marks
on
the
sand
caused
by
the
great
during
their
nocturnal
visits
to
the
if
they
are
green
turtle
he
continued
we
are
in
the
lap
of
luxury
they
lard
the
alderman
and
inspire
the
poet
when
a
ship
comes
to
our
assistance
i
will
persuade
the
captain
to
freight
the
vessel
with
them
and
make
my
fortune
i
suppose
under
the
circumstances
you
were
not
a
rich
man
jenks
said
iris
timidly
i
possess
a
wealthy
bachelor
uncle
who
made
me
his
heir
and
allowed
me
four
hundred
a
year
so
i
was
a
sort
of
croesus
among
staff
corps
officers
when
the
smash
came
he
disowned
me
by
cable
by
selling
my
ponies
and
my
other
belongings
i
was
able
to
walk
out
of
my
quarters
penniless
but
free
from
debt
and
all
through
a
deceitful
woman
yes
iris
peeped
at
him
from
under
the
brim
of
her
he
seemed
to
be
absurdly
contented
so
different
was
his
tone
in
discussing
a
necessarily
painful
topic
to
the
attitude
he
adopted
during
the
attack
on
the
she
was
puzzled
but
ventured
a
further
step
was
she
very
bad
to
you
mr
jenks
he
stopped
and
laughed
actually
roared
at
the
suggestion
bad
to
me
he
repeated
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
she
was
humbugging
her
husband
not
me
fool
that
i
was
i
could
not
mind
my
own
business
so
costobell
was
not
flirting
with
the
man
who
suffered
on
her
account
it
is
a
regrettable
but
true
statement
that
iris
would
willingly
have
hugged
costobell
at
that
moment
she
walked
on
air
during
the
next
of
golden
silence
and
jenks
did
not
remind
her
that
they
were
passing
the
gruesome
valley
of
death
rounding
europa
point
the
sailor
eyes
were
fixed
on
their
immediate
surroundings
but
iris
gazed
dreamily
ahead
hence
it
was
that
she
was
the
first
to
cry
in
amazement
a
boat
see
there
on
the
rocks
there
was
no
mistake
a
ship
boat
was
perched
high
and
dry
on
the
north
side
of
the
cape
even
as
they
scrambled
towards
it
jenks
understood
how
it
had
come
there
when
the
parted
amidships
the
after
section
fell
back
into
the
depths
beyond
the
reef
and
this
boat
must
have
broken
loose
from
its
davits
and
been
driven
ashore
here
by
the
force
of
the
western
current
was
it
intact
could
they
escape
was
this
ark
stranded
on
the
island
for
their
benefit
if
it
were
seaworthy
whither
should
they
steer
to
those
islands
whose
blue
outlines
were
visible
on
the
horizon
these
and
a
hundred
other
questions
coursed
through
his
brain
during
the
race
over
the
rocks
but
all
such
wild
speculations
were
promptly
settled
when
they
reached
the
craft
for
the
keel
and
the
whole
of
the
lower
timbers
were
smashed
into
matchwood
but
there
were
stores
on
board
jenks
remembered
that
captain
foresight
had
secured
the
provisioning
of
all
the
ship
boats
soon
after
the
first
wild
rush
to
steady
the
vessel
after
the
propeller
was
lost
masts
sails
oars
seats
all
save
two
had
gone
but
jenks
with
eager
hands
unfastened
the
lockers
and
here
he
found
a
good
supply
of
tinned
meats
and
biscuits
they
had
barely
recovered
from
the
excitement
of
this
find
when
the
sailor
noticed
that
behind
the
rocks
on
which
the
craft
was
firmly
lodged
lay
a
small
natural
basin
full
of
salt
water
replenished
and
freshened
by
the
spray
of
every
gale
and
completely
shut
off
from
all
seaward
access
it
was
not
more
than
four
feet
deep
beautifully
carpeted
with
sand
and
secluded
by
rocks
on
all
sides
not
the
tiniest
crab
or
fish
was
to
be
seen
it
provided
an
ideal
bath
iris
was
overjoyed
she
pointed
towards
their
habitation
jenks
she
said
i
will
be
with
you
at
he
gathered
all
the
tins
he
was
able
to
carry
and
strode
off
enjoining
her
to
fire
her
revolver
if
for
the
slightest
reason
she
wanted
assistance
and
giving
a
parting
warning
that
if
she
delayed
too
long
he
would
come
and
shout
to
her
i
wonder
said
the
girl
to
herself
watching
his
retreating
figure
what
he
is
afraid
of
surely
by
this
time
we
have
exhausted
the
unpleasant
surprises
of
the
island
anyhow
now
for
a
splash
she
was
hardly
in
the
water
before
she
began
to
be
afraid
on
account
of
jenks
suppose
anything
happened
to
him
whilst
she
was
thoughtlessly
enjoying
herself
here
so
strongly
did
the
thought
possess
her
that
she
hurriedly
dressed
again
and
ran
off
to
find
him
he
was
engaged
in
fastening
a
number
of
bayonets
transversely
to
a
long
piece
of
timber
what
are
you
doing
that
for
she
asked
why
did
you
return
so
soon
did
anything
alarm
you
i
thought
you
might
get
into
mischief
she
confessed
no
on
the
other
hand
i
am
trying
to
make
trouble
for
any
unwelcome
visitors
he
replied
this
is
a
de
which
i
intend
to
set
up
in
front
of
our
cave
in
case
we
are
compelled
to
defend
ourselves
against
an
attack
by
savages
with
this
barring
the
way
they
can
not
rush
the
position
she
sighed
rainbow
island
was
a
wild
spot
after
all
did
not
thorns
and
briers
grow
very
close
to
the
gates
of
eden
on
the
nineteenth
day
of
their
residence
on
the
island
the
sailor
climbed
as
was
his
invariable
habit
to
the
summit
rock
whilst
iris
prepared
breakfast
at
this
early
hour
the
horizon
was
clearly
cut
as
the
rim
of
a
sapphire
he
examined
the
whole
arc
of
the
sea
with
his
glasses
but
not
a
sail
was
in
sight
according
to
his
calculations
the
growing
anxiety
as
to
the
fate
of
the
must
long
ere
this
have
culminated
in
the
dispatch
from
hong
kong
or
singapore
of
a
special
search
vessel
whilst
british
warships
in
the
china
sea
would
be
warned
to
keep
a
close
lookout
for
any
traces
of
the
steamer
to
visit
all
islands
on
their
route
and
to
question
fishermen
whom
they
encountered
so
help
might
come
any
day
or
it
might
be
long
deferred
he
could
not
pierce
the
future
and
it
was
useless
to
vex
his
soul
with
questionings
as
to
what
might
happen
next
week
the
great
certainty
of
the
hour
was
iris
the
smiling
divinity
who
had
come
into
his
life
waiting
for
him
down
there
beyond
the
trees
waiting
to
welcome
him
with
a
greeting
and
he
knew
with
a
fierce
devouring
joy
that
her
cheek
would
not
pale
nor
her
lip
tremble
when
he
announced
that
at
least
another
sun
must
set
before
the
expected
relief
reached
them
he
replaced
the
glasses
in
their
case
and
dived
into
the
wood
giving
a
passing
thought
to
the
fact
that
the
wind
after
blowing
steadily
from
the
south
for
nearly
a
week
had
veered
round
to
the
during
the
night
did
the
change
portend
a
storm
well
they
were
now
prepared
for
all
such
eventualities
and
he
had
not
forgotten
that
they
possessed
among
other
treasures
a
box
of
books
for
rainy
days
and
a
rainy
day
with
iris
for
company
what
gale
that
ever
blew
could
offer
such
compensation
for
enforced
idleness
the
morning
sped
in
uneventful
work
iris
did
not
neglect
her
cherished
after
luncheon
it
was
her
custom
now
to
carry
a
dishful
of
water
to
its
apparently
arid
roots
and
she
rose
to
fulfil
her
task
let
me
help
you
said
jenks
i
am
not
very
busy
this
afternoon
no
thank
you
i
simply
wo
allow
you
to
touch
that
shrub
the
dear
thing
looks
quite
glad
to
see
me
it
drinks
up
the
water
as
greedily
as
a
thirsty
animal
even
a
cabbage
has
a
heart
miss
deane
she
laughed
merrily
i
do
believe
you
are
offering
me
a
compliment
she
said
i
must
indeed
have
found
favor
in
your
eyes
he
had
schooled
himself
to
resist
the
opening
given
by
this
class
of
retort
so
he
turned
to
make
some
corrections
in
the
scale
of
the
he
had
constructed
aided
therein
by
daily
observations
with
the
sextant
left
by
the
former
inhabitant
of
the
cave
iris
had
been
gone
perhaps
five
minutes
when
he
heard
a
distant
shriek
twice
repeated
and
then
there
came
faintly
to
his
ears
his
own
name
not
jenks
but
robert
in
the
girl
voice
something
terrible
had
happened
it
was
a
cry
of
supreme
distress
mortal
agony
or
overwhelming
terror
alone
could
wring
that
name
from
her
lips
precisely
in
such
moments
this
man
acted
with
the
decision
the
unerring
judgment
the
instantaneous
acceptance
of
great
risk
to
accomplish
great
results
that
marked
him
out
as
a
born
soldier
he
rushed
into
the
house
and
snatched
from
the
one
of
the
six
reposing
there
in
order
each
with
a
filled
magazine
attached
and
a
cartridge
already
in
position
then
he
ran
with
long
swift
strides
not
through
the
trees
where
he
could
see
nothing
but
towards
the
beach
whence
in
forty
yards
the
place
where
iris
probably
was
would
become
visible
at
once
he
saw
her
struggling
in
the
grasp
of
two
dyaks
one
by
his
garments
a
person
of
consequence
the
other
a
savage
hideous
and
repulsive
in
appearance
around
them
seven
men
armed
with
guns
and
parangs
were
dancing
with
excitement
iris
captors
were
endeavoring
to
tie
her
arms
but
she
was
a
strong
and
active
englishwoman
with
muscles
well
knit
by
the
constant
labor
of
recent
busy
days
and
a
frame
developed
by
years
of
and
the
pair
evidently
found
her
a
tough
handful
and
the
inferior
dyak
either
to
stop
her
screams
for
she
was
shrieking
robert
come
to
me
with
all
her
might
or
to
stifle
her
into
submission
roughly
placed
his
huge
hand
over
her
mouth
these
things
the
sailor
noticed
instantly
some
men
brave
to
rashness
ready
as
he
to
give
his
life
to
save
her
would
have
raced
madly
over
the
intervening
ground
scarce
a
furlong
and
attempted
a
heroic
combat
of
one
against
nine
not
so
jenks
with
the
methodical
exactness
of
the
he
settled
down
on
one
knee
and
leveled
the
rifle
at
that
range
the
bullet
travels
practically
usually
it
is
deficient
in
stopping
power
but
he
had
provided
against
this
little
drawback
by
notching
all
the
cartridges
in
the
six
rifles
after
the
effective
manner
devised
by
an
expert
named
thomas
atkins
during
the
tirah
campaign
none
of
the
dyaks
saw
him
all
were
intent
on
the
sensational
prize
they
had
secured
a
young
and
beautiful
white
woman
so
contentedly
roaming
about
the
shores
of
this
fetish
island
with
the
slow
speed
advised
by
the
roman
philosopher
the
backsight
and
foresight
of
the
came
into
line
with
the
breast
of
the
coarse
brute
clutching
the
girl
face
then
something
bit
him
above
the
heart
and
simultaneously
tore
half
of
his
back
into
fragments
he
fell
with
a
queer
sob
and
the
others
turned
to
face
this
unexpected
danger
iris
knowing
only
that
she
was
free
from
that
hateful
grasp
wrenched
herself
free
from
the
chief
hold
and
ran
with
all
her
might
along
the
beach
to
jenks
and
safety
again
and
yet
again
the
rifle
gave
its
short
sharp
snarl
and
two
more
dyaks
collapsed
on
the
sand
six
were
left
their
leader
being
still
unconsciously
preserved
from
death
by
the
figure
of
the
flying
girl
a
fourth
dyak
dropped
the
survivors
cruel
savages
but
not
cowards
unslung
their
guns
the
sailor
grim
with
an
unpleasant
gleam
in
his
eyes
and
a
lower
jaw
protruding
noticed
their
preparations
to
the
left
he
shouted
run
towards
the
trees
iris
heard
him
and
strove
to
obey
but
her
strength
was
failing
her
and
she
staggered
blindly
after
a
few
despairing
efforts
she
lurched
feebly
to
her
knees
and
tumbled
face
downwards
on
the
broken
coral
that
had
tripped
her
faltering
footsteps
jenks
was
watching
her
watching
the
remaining
dyaks
from
whom
a
spluttering
volley
came
picking
out
his
quarry
with
the
murderous
ease
of
a
terrier
in
a
something
like
a
bee
in
a
violent
hurry
hummed
past
his
ear
and
a
rock
near
his
right
foot
was
struck
a
tremendous
blow
by
an
unseen
agency
he
liked
this
it
would
be
a
battle
not
a
battue
the
fifth
dyak
crumpled
into
the
distortion
of
death
and
then
their
leader
took
deliberate
aim
at
the
kneeling
marksman
who
threatened
to
wipe
him
and
his
band
out
of
existence
but
his
deliberation
though
skilful
was
too
profound
the
sailor
fired
first
and
was
professionally
astonished
to
see
the
gaudily
attired
individual
tossed
violently
backward
for
many
yards
finally
pitching
headlong
to
the
earth
had
he
been
charged
by
a
bull
in
full
career
he
could
not
have
been
more
utterly
discomfited
the
incident
was
sensational
but
inexplicable
yet
another
member
of
the
band
was
prostrated
ere
the
two
as
yet
unscathed
thought
fit
to
beat
a
retreat
this
they
now
did
with
celerity
but
they
dragged
their
chief
with
them
it
was
no
part
of
jenks
programme
to
allow
them
to
escape
he
aimed
again
at
the
man
nearest
the
trees
there
was
a
sharp
click
and
nothing
more
the
cartridge
was
a
he
hastily
sought
to
eject
it
and
the
rifle
jammed
these
little
accidents
will
happen
even
in
a
good
weapon
like
the
springing
to
his
feet
with
a
yell
he
ran
forward
the
flying
men
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
and
accelerated
their
movements
just
as
he
reached
iris
they
vanished
among
the
trees
slinging
the
rifle
over
his
shoulder
he
picked
up
the
girl
in
his
arms
she
was
conscious
but
breathless
you
are
not
hurt
he
gasped
his
eyes
blazing
into
her
face
with
an
intensity
that
she
afterwards
remembered
as
appalling
no
she
whispered
listen
he
continued
in
labored
jerks
try
and
obey
me
exactly
i
will
carry
you
to
the
cave
stop
there
shoot
any
one
you
see
till
i
come
she
heard
him
wonderingly
was
he
going
to
leave
her
now
that
he
had
her
safely
clasped
to
his
breast
impossible
ah
she
understood
those
men
must
have
landed
in
a
boat
he
intended
to
attack
them
again
he
was
going
to
fight
them
and
she
would
not
know
what
happened
to
him
until
it
was
all
over
gradually
her
vitality
returned
she
almost
smiled
at
the
fantastic
conceit
that
would
desert
jenks
placed
her
on
her
feet
at
the
entrance
to
the
cave
you
understand
he
cried
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
ran
to
the
house
for
another
rifle
this
time
to
her
amazement
he
darted
back
through
prospect
park
towards
the
south
beach
the
sailor
knew
that
the
dyaks
had
landed
at
the
sandy
bay
iris
had
christened
smugglers
cove
they
were
acquainted
with
the
passage
through
the
reef
and
came
from
the
distant
islands
now
they
would
endeavor
to
escape
by
the
same
channel
they
must
be
prevented
at
all
costs
he
was
right
as
they
came
out
into
the
open
he
saw
three
men
not
two
pushing
off
a
large
sampan
one
of
them
was
the
chief
then
jenks
understood
that
his
bullet
had
hit
the
lock
of
the
dyak
uplifted
weapon
with
the
result
already
described
by
a
miracle
he
had
escaped
he
coolly
prepared
to
slay
the
three
of
them
with
the
same
calm
purpose
that
distinguished
the
opening
phase
of
this
singularly
conflict
the
distance
was
much
greater
perhaps
yards
from
the
point
where
the
boat
came
into
view
he
knelt
and
fired
he
judged
that
the
missile
struck
the
craft
between
the
trio
i
did
allow
for
the
sun
on
the
side
of
the
foresight
he
said
or
perhaps
i
am
a
bit
shaky
after
the
run
in
any
event
they
ca
go
far
a
hurrying
step
on
the
coral
behind
him
caught
his
ear
instantly
he
sprang
up
and
faced
about
to
see
iris
they
are
escaping
she
said
no
fear
of
that
he
replied
turning
away
from
her
where
are
the
others
dead
do
you
mean
that
you
killed
nearly
all
those
men
six
of
them
there
were
nine
in
all
he
knelt
again
lifting
the
rifle
iris
threw
herself
on
her
knees
by
his
side
there
was
something
awful
to
her
in
this
chill
and
declaration
of
a
fixed
purpose
jenks
she
said
clasping
her
hands
in
an
agony
of
entreaty
do
not
kill
more
men
for
my
sake
for
my
own
sake
then
he
growled
annoyed
at
the
interruption
as
the
sampan
was
afloat
then
i
ask
you
for
god
sake
not
to
take
another
life
what
you
have
already
done
was
unavoidable
perhaps
right
this
is
murder
he
lowered
his
weapon
and
looked
at
her
if
those
men
get
away
they
will
bring
back
a
host
to
avenge
their
comrades
and
secure
you
he
added
it
may
be
the
will
of
providence
for
such
a
thing
to
happen
yet
i
implore
you
to
spare
them
he
placed
the
rifle
on
the
sand
and
raised
her
tenderly
for
she
had
yielded
to
a
paroxysm
of
tears
not
another
word
did
either
of
them
speak
in
that
hour
the
large
triangular
sail
of
the
sampan
was
now
bellying
out
in
the
south
wind
a
figure
stood
up
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
and
shook
a
menacing
arm
at
the
couple
on
the
beach
it
was
the
malay
chief
cursing
them
with
the
rude
eloquence
of
his
barbarous
tongue
and
jenks
well
knew
what
he
was
saying
chapter
viii
preparations
they
looked
long
and
steadfastly
at
the
retreating
boat
soon
it
diminished
to
a
mere
speck
on
the
smooth
sea
the
even
breeze
kept
its
canvas
taut
and
the
sailor
knew
that
no
ruse
was
intended
the
dyaks
were
flying
from
the
island
in
fear
and
rage
they
would
return
with
a
force
sufficient
to
insure
the
wreaking
of
their
vengeance
that
he
would
again
encounter
them
at
no
distant
date
jenks
had
no
doubt
whatever
they
would
land
in
such
numbers
as
to
render
any
resistance
difficult
and
a
prolonged
defence
impossible
would
help
come
first
a
distracting
question
to
which
definite
answer
could
not
be
given
the
sailor
brow
frowned
in
deep
lines
his
brain
throbbed
now
with
an
anxiety
singularly
at
variance
with
his
cool
demeanor
during
the
fight
he
was
utterly
unconscious
that
his
left
arm
encircled
the
shoulder
of
the
girl
until
she
gently
disengaged
herself
and
said
appealingly
please
jenks
do
not
be
angry
with
me
i
could
not
help
it
i
could
not
bear
to
see
you
shoot
them
then
he
abruptly
awoke
to
the
realities
of
the
moment
come
he
said
his
drawn
features
relaxing
into
a
wonderfully
pleasing
smile
we
will
return
to
our
castle
we
are
safe
for
the
remainder
of
this
day
at
any
rate
something
must
be
said
or
done
to
reassure
her
she
was
still
grievously
disturbed
and
he
naturally
ascribed
her
agitation
to
the
horror
of
her
capture
he
dreaded
a
complete
collapse
if
any
further
alarms
threatened
at
once
yet
he
was
almost
positive
though
search
alone
would
set
at
rest
the
last
misgiving
that
only
one
sampan
had
visited
the
island
evidently
the
dyaks
were
unprepared
as
he
for
the
events
of
the
preceding
they
were
either
visiting
the
island
to
procure
turtle
and
or
had
merely
called
there
to
some
other
destination
and
the
change
in
the
wind
had
unexpectedly
compelled
them
to
put
ashore
beyond
all
doubt
they
must
have
been
surprised
by
the
warmth
of
the
reception
they
encountered
probably
when
he
went
to
summit
rock
that
morning
the
savages
had
lowered
their
sail
and
were
steadily
paddling
north
against
wind
and
current
the
most
careful
scrutiny
of
the
sea
would
fail
to
reveal
them
beyond
a
distance
of
six
or
seven
miles
at
the
utmost
after
landing
in
the
hidden
bay
on
the
south
side
they
crossed
the
island
through
the
trees
instead
of
taking
the
more
natural
open
way
along
the
beach
why
the
fact
that
he
and
iris
were
then
passing
the
tract
leading
to
the
valley
of
death
instantly
determined
this
point
the
dyaks
knew
of
this
affrighting
hollow
and
would
not
approach
any
nearer
to
it
than
was
unavoidable
could
he
twist
this
circumstance
to
advantage
if
iris
and
he
were
still
stranded
there
when
the
superstitious
next
put
in
an
appearance
he
would
see
all
depended
on
the
girl
strength
if
she
gave
way
now
if
instead
of
taking
instant
measures
for
safety
he
were
called
upon
to
nurse
her
through
a
fever
the
outlook
became
not
only
desperate
but
hopeless
and
whilst
he
bent
his
brows
in
worrying
thought
the
color
was
returning
to
iris
cheeks
and
natural
buoyancy
to
her
step
it
is
the
fault
of
all
men
to
underrate
the
marvelous
courage
and
constancy
of
woman
in
the
face
of
difficulties
and
trials
jenks
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
you
do
not
ask
me
for
any
account
of
my
adventures
she
said
quietly
after
watching
his
perplexed
expression
in
silence
for
some
time
her
tone
almost
startled
him
its
unassumed
cheerfulness
was
so
unlooked
for
no
he
answered
i
thought
you
were
too
overwrought
to
talk
of
them
at
present
overwrought
not
a
bit
of
it
i
was
dead
beat
with
the
struggle
and
with
screaming
for
you
but
please
do
imagine
that
i
am
going
to
faint
or
treat
you
to
a
display
of
hysteria
now
that
all
the
excitement
has
ended
i
admit
that
i
cried
a
little
when
you
pushed
me
aside
on
the
beach
and
raised
your
gun
to
fire
at
those
poor
wretches
flying
for
their
lives
yet
perhaps
i
was
wrong
to
hinder
you
you
were
wrong
he
gravely
interrupted
then
you
should
not
have
heeded
me
no
i
do
mean
that
you
always
consider
me
first
do
you
no
matter
what
i
ask
you
to
do
you
endeavor
to
please
me
even
when
you
know
all
the
time
that
i
am
acting
or
speaking
foolishly
the
unthinking
of
her
words
sent
the
blood
coursing
wildly
through
his
veins
never
mind
she
went
on
with
earnest
simplicity
god
has
been
very
good
to
us
i
can
not
believe
that
he
has
preserved
us
from
so
many
dangers
to
permit
us
to
perish
miserably
a
few
hours
or
days
before
help
comes
and
i
want
to
tell
you
exactly
what
happened
then
you
shall
he
answered
but
first
drink
this
they
had
reached
their
and
he
hastened
to
procure
a
small
quantity
of
brandy
she
swallowed
the
spirit
with
a
protesting
she
really
needed
no
such
adventitious
support
she
said
all
right
commented
jenks
if
you
do
want
a
drink
i
do
i
can
quite
believe
it
she
retorted
case
is
very
different
knew
the
men
would
not
hurt
me
after
the
first
shock
of
their
appearance
had
passed
i
mean
i
also
knew
that
you
would
save
me
but
you
jenks
had
to
do
the
fighting
you
were
called
upon
to
rescue
precious
me
good
gracious
no
wonder
you
were
excited
the
sailor
mentally
expressed
his
inability
to
grasp
the
complexities
of
feminine
nature
but
iris
rattled
on
i
carried
my
tin
of
water
to
the
and
was
listening
to
the
greedy
roots
gurgling
away
for
dear
life
when
suddenly
four
men
sprang
out
from
among
the
trees
and
seized
my
arms
before
i
could
reach
my
revolver
thank
heaven
you
failed
you
think
that
if
i
had
fired
at
them
they
would
have
retaliated
yes
especially
if
i
had
hit
the
chief
but
it
was
he
who
instantly
gave
some
order
and
i
suppose
it
meant
that
they
were
not
to
hurt
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
seemed
to
be
quite
as
much
astonished
as
i
was
alarmed
but
if
they
could
hold
my
hands
they
could
not
stop
my
voice
so
readily
oh
did
i
yell
you
did
i
suppose
you
could
not
hear
me
distinctly
quite
distinctly
every
word
yes
she
bent
to
pick
some
leaves
and
bits
of
dry
grass
from
her
dress
well
you
know
she
continued
rapidly
in
such
moments
one
can
not
choose
one
words
i
just
shouted
the
first
thing
that
came
into
my
head
and
i
he
said
picked
up
the
first
rifle
i
could
lay
hands
on
now
miss
deane
as
the
affair
has
ended
so
happily
may
i
venture
to
ask
you
to
remain
in
the
cave
until
i
return
oh
please
she
began
really
i
must
insist
i
would
not
leave
you
if
it
were
not
quite
imperative
you
come
with
me
then
she
understood
one
at
least
of
the
tasks
he
must
perform
and
she
meekly
obeyed
he
thought
it
best
to
go
along
turtle
beach
to
the
cove
and
thence
follow
the
dyaks
trail
through
the
wood
as
this
line
of
advance
would
entail
practically
a
complete
circuit
of
the
island
he
omitted
no
precautions
in
his
advance
often
he
stopped
and
listened
intently
whenever
he
doubled
a
point
or
passed
among
the
trees
he
crept
back
and
peered
along
the
way
he
had
come
to
see
if
any
lurking
foes
were
breaking
shelter
behind
him
the
marks
on
the
sand
proved
that
only
one
sampan
had
been
beached
thence
he
found
nothing
of
special
interest
until
he
came
upon
the
chief
gun
lying
close
to
the
trees
on
the
north
side
it
was
a
very
ornamental
weapon
a
the
stock
was
inlaid
with
gold
and
ivory
and
the
piece
had
evidently
been
looted
from
some
junk
surprised
and
sacked
in
a
former
foray
the
lock
was
smashed
by
the
impact
of
the
bullet
but
close
investigation
of
the
and
the
discovery
of
certain
unmistakable
evidences
on
the
beach
showed
that
the
dyak
leader
had
lost
two
if
not
three
fingers
of
his
right
hand
so
he
has
something
more
than
his
passion
to
nurse
mused
jenks
that
at
any
rate
is
fortunate
he
will
be
in
no
mood
for
further
enterprise
for
some
time
to
come
he
dreaded
lest
any
of
the
dyaks
should
be
only
badly
wounded
and
likely
to
live
it
was
an
actual
relief
to
his
nerves
to
find
that
the
improvised
had
done
their
work
too
well
to
permit
anxiety
on
that
score
on
the
principle
that
a
dead
injun
is
a
good
injun
these
dyaks
were
good
dyaks
he
gathered
the
guns
swords
and
krisses
of
the
slain
with
all
their
uncouth
belts
and
ornaments
in
pursuance
of
a
vaguely
defined
plan
of
future
action
he
also
divested
some
of
the
men
of
their
coarse
garments
and
collected
six
hats
shaped
like
inverted
basins
these
things
he
placed
in
a
heap
near
the
thenceforth
for
half
an
hour
the
placid
surface
of
the
lagoon
was
disturbed
by
the
black
dorsal
fins
of
many
sharks
to
one
of
the
sailor
temperament
there
was
nothing
revolting
in
the
concluding
portion
of
his
task
he
had
a
right
to
live
it
was
his
paramount
duty
remitted
only
by
death
itself
to
endeavor
to
save
iris
from
the
indescribable
fate
from
which
no
power
could
rescue
her
if
ever
she
fell
into
the
hands
of
these
vindictive
savages
therefore
it
was
war
between
him
and
them
war
to
the
bitter
end
war
with
no
humane
mitigation
of
its
horrors
and
penalties
the
last
dread
arbitrament
of
man
forced
to
adopt
the
methods
of
the
tiger
his
guess
at
the
weather
conditions
heralded
by
the
change
of
wind
was
right
as
the
two
partook
of
their
evening
meal
the
complaining
surf
lashed
the
reef
and
the
tremulous
branches
of
the
taller
trees
voiced
the
approach
of
a
gale
a
tropical
storm
not
a
typhoon
but
a
belated
burst
of
the
periodic
rains
deluged
the
island
before
midnight
hours
earlier
iris
retired
utterly
worn
by
the
events
of
the
day
needless
to
say
there
was
no
singing
that
evening
the
gale
chanted
a
wild
melody
in
mournful
chords
and
the
noise
of
the
watery
downpour
on
the
tarpaulin
roof
of
belle
vue
castle
was
such
as
to
render
conversation
impossible
save
in
wearying
shouts
luckily
jenks
carpentry
was
effective
though
rough
the
building
was
and
he
had
calked
every
crevice
with
unraveled
rope
until
iris
apartment
was
free
from
the
tiniest
draught
the
very
fury
of
the
external
turmoil
acted
as
a
lullaby
to
the
girl
she
was
soon
asleep
and
the
sailor
was
left
to
his
thoughts
sleep
he
could
not
he
smoked
steadily
with
a
magnificent
prodigality
for
his
small
stock
of
tobacco
was
fast
diminishing
he
ransacked
his
brains
to
discover
some
method
of
escape
from
this
enchanted
island
where
fairies
jostled
with
demons
and
hours
of
utter
happiness
found
their
bane
in
moments
of
frightful
peril
of
course
he
ought
to
have
killed
those
fellows
who
escaped
their
sampan
might
have
provided
a
last
desperate
expedient
if
other
savages
effected
a
landing
well
there
was
no
use
in
being
wise
after
the
event
and
scheme
as
he
might
he
could
devise
no
way
to
avoid
disaster
during
the
next
attack
this
he
felt
certain
would
take
place
at
night
the
dyaks
would
land
in
force
rush
the
cave
and
hut
and
overpower
him
by
sheer
numbers
the
fight
if
fight
there
was
would
be
sharp
but
decisive
perhaps
if
he
received
some
warning
iris
and
he
might
retreat
in
the
darkness
to
the
cover
of
the
trees
a
last
stand
could
be
made
among
the
boulders
on
summit
rock
but
of
what
avail
to
purchase
their
freedom
until
daylight
and
then
if
ever
man
wrestled
with
desperate
problem
jenks
wrought
that
night
he
smoked
and
pondered
until
the
storm
passed
and
with
the
changefulness
of
a
poet
muse
a
full
moon
flooded
the
island
in
glorious
radiance
he
rose
opened
the
door
and
stood
without
listening
for
a
little
while
to
the
roaring
of
the
surf
and
the
crash
of
the
broken
coral
swept
from
reef
and
shore
by
the
backwash
the
petty
strife
of
the
elements
was
soothing
to
him
they
are
snarling
like
whipped
dogs
he
said
aloud
one
might
almost
fancy
her
ladyship
the
moon
appearing
on
the
scene
as
a
uranian
venus
cowing
sea
and
storm
by
the
majesty
of
her
presence
pleased
with
the
conceit
he
looked
steadily
at
the
brilliant
luminary
for
some
time
then
his
eyes
were
attracted
by
the
strong
lights
thrown
upon
the
rugged
face
of
the
precipice
into
which
the
cavern
burrowed
unconsciously
relieving
his
tired
senses
he
was
idly
wondering
what
trick
of
color
turner
would
have
adopted
to
convey
those
sharp
yet
weirdly
beautiful
contrasts
when
suddenly
he
uttered
a
startled
exclamation
by
jove
he
murmured
i
never
noticed
that
before
the
feature
which
so
earnestly
claimed
his
attention
was
a
deep
ledge
directly
over
the
mouth
of
the
cave
but
some
forty
feet
from
the
ground
behind
it
the
wall
of
rock
sloped
darkly
inwards
suggesting
a
recess
extending
by
haphazard
computation
at
least
a
couple
of
yards
it
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
the
fault
in
the
interior
of
the
tunnel
had
its
outcrop
here
and
the
deodorizing
influences
of
rain
and
sun
had
extended
the
weak
point
thus
exposed
in
the
bold
panoply
of
stone
he
surveyed
the
ledge
from
different
points
of
view
it
was
quite
inaccessible
and
most
difficult
to
estimate
accurately
from
the
ground
level
the
sailor
was
a
man
of
action
he
chose
the
nearest
tall
tree
and
began
to
climb
he
was
not
eight
feet
from
the
ground
before
several
birds
flew
out
from
its
leafy
recesses
filling
the
air
with
shrill
clucking
the
devil
take
them
he
growled
for
he
feared
that
the
commotion
would
awaken
iris
he
was
still
laboriously
worming
his
way
through
the
inner
maze
of
branches
when
a
voice
reached
him
from
the
ground
jenks
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
up
there
oh
so
those
wretched
fowls
aroused
you
he
replied
yes
but
why
did
you
arouse
them
i
had
a
fancy
to
roost
by
way
of
a
change
please
be
serious
i
am
more
than
serious
this
tree
grows
a
variety
of
small
sharp
thorn
that
induces
a
maximum
of
gravity
before
one
takes
the
next
step
but
why
do
you
keep
on
climbing
it
is
sheer
lunacy
i
admit
yet
on
such
a
moonlit
night
there
is
some
reasonable
ground
for
even
a
mad
excuse
jenks
tell
me
at
once
what
you
are
doing
iris
strove
to
be
severe
but
there
was
a
touch
of
anxiety
in
her
tone
that
instantly
made
the
sailor
apologetic
he
told
her
about
the
ledge
and
explained
his
notion
that
here
they
might
secure
a
safe
retreat
in
case
of
further
attack
a
refuge
from
which
they
might
defy
assault
during
many
days
it
was
he
said
absolutely
impossible
to
wait
until
the
morning
he
must
at
once
satisfy
himself
whether
the
project
was
impracticable
or
worthy
of
further
investigation
so
the
girl
only
enjoined
him
to
be
careful
and
he
vigorously
renewed
the
climb
at
last
some
feet
from
the
ground
an
accidental
parting
in
the
branches
enabled
him
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
ledge
one
glance
set
his
heart
beating
joyously
it
was
at
least
fifteen
feet
in
length
it
shelved
back
until
its
depth
was
lost
in
the
blackness
of
the
shadows
and
the
floor
must
be
either
nearly
level
or
sloping
slightly
inwards
to
the
line
of
the
fault
the
place
was
a
perfect
eagle
nest
a
chamois
could
not
reach
it
from
any
direction
it
became
accessible
to
man
only
by
means
of
a
ladder
or
a
balloon
more
excited
by
this
discovery
than
he
cared
for
iris
to
know
he
endeavored
to
appear
unconcerned
when
he
regained
the
ground
well
she
said
tell
me
all
about
it
he
described
the
nature
of
the
cavity
as
well
as
he
understood
it
at
the
moment
and
emphasized
his
previous
explanation
of
its
virtues
here
they
might
reasonably
hope
to
make
a
successful
stand
against
the
dyaks
then
you
feel
sure
that
those
awful
creatures
will
come
back
she
said
slowly
only
too
sure
unfortunately
how
remorseless
poor
humanity
is
when
the
veneer
is
stripped
off
why
can
not
they
leave
us
in
peace
i
suppose
they
now
cherish
a
blood
feud
against
us
perhaps
if
i
had
not
been
here
they
would
not
have
injured
you
somehow
i
seem
to
be
bound
up
with
your
misfortunes
i
would
not
have
it
otherwise
were
it
in
my
power
he
answered
for
an
instant
he
left
unchallenged
the
girl
assumption
that
she
was
in
any
way
responsible
for
the
disasters
which
had
broken
up
his
career
he
looked
into
her
eyes
and
almost
forgot
himself
then
the
sense
of
fair
dealing
that
dominates
every
true
gentleman
rose
within
him
and
gripped
his
wavering
emotions
with
ruthless
force
was
this
a
time
to
play
upon
the
sensibilities
of
this
youthful
daughter
of
the
gods
to
seek
to
win
from
her
a
confession
of
love
that
a
few
brief
days
or
weeks
might
prove
to
be
only
a
spasmodic
but
momentarily
gratitude
for
the
protection
he
had
given
her
and
he
spoke
aloud
striving
to
laugh
lest
his
words
should
falter
you
can
console
yourself
with
the
thought
miss
deane
that
your
presence
on
the
island
will
in
no
way
affect
my
fate
at
the
hands
of
the
dyaks
had
they
caught
me
unprepared
today
my
head
would
now
be
covered
with
a
solution
of
the
special
varnish
they
carry
on
every
foreign
expedition
varnish
she
exclaimed
yes
as
a
preservative
you
understand
and
yet
these
men
are
human
beings
for
purposes
of
classification
yes
keeping
to
strict
fact
it
was
lucky
for
me
that
you
raised
the
alarm
and
gave
me
a
chance
to
discount
the
odds
of
mere
numbers
so
you
see
you
really
did
me
a
good
turn
what
can
be
done
now
to
save
our
lives
anything
will
be
better
than
to
await
another
attack
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
try
to
get
some
sleep
before
daylight
how
did
you
know
i
was
not
in
the
castle
i
can
not
tell
you
i
awoke
and
knew
you
were
not
near
me
if
i
wake
in
the
night
i
can
always
tell
whether
or
not
you
are
in
the
next
room
so
i
dressed
and
came
out
ah
he
said
quietly
evidently
i
snore
this
explanation
killed
romance
iris
retreated
and
the
sailor
tired
out
at
last
managed
to
close
his
weary
eyes
next
morning
he
hastily
constructed
a
pole
of
sufficient
length
and
strong
enough
to
bear
his
weight
by
tying
two
sturdy
young
trees
together
with
ropes
iris
helped
him
to
raise
it
against
the
face
of
the
precipice
and
he
at
once
climbed
to
the
ledge
here
he
found
his
observations
of
the
previous
night
abundantly
verified
the
ledge
was
even
wider
than
he
dared
to
hope
nearly
ten
feet
deep
in
one
part
and
it
sloped
sharply
downwards
from
the
outer
lip
of
the
rock
by
lying
flat
and
carefully
testing
all
points
of
view
he
ascertained
that
the
only
possible
positions
from
which
even
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
floor
could
be
obtained
were
the
branches
of
a
few
tall
trees
and
the
extreme
right
of
the
opposing
precipice
nearly
ninety
yards
distant
there
was
ample
room
to
store
water
and
provisions
and
he
quickly
saw
that
even
some
sort
of
shelter
from
the
fierce
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
often
piercing
cold
of
the
night
might
be
achieved
by
judiciously
rigging
up
a
tarpaulin
this
is
a
genuine
bit
of
good
luck
he
mused
here
provided
neither
of
us
is
hit
we
can
hold
out
for
a
week
or
longer
at
a
pinch
how
can
it
be
possible
that
i
should
have
lived
on
this
island
so
many
days
and
yet
hit
upon
this
nook
of
safety
by
mere
chance
as
it
were
not
until
he
reached
the
level
again
could
he
solve
the
puzzle
then
he
perceived
that
the
way
in
which
the
cliff
bulged
out
on
both
sides
prevented
the
ledge
from
becoming
evident
in
profile
whilst
seen
plein
in
the
glare
of
the
sunlight
it
suggested
nothing
more
than
a
slight
indentation
he
rapidly
sketched
to
iris
the
defensive
plan
which
the
eagle
nest
suggested
access
must
be
provided
by
means
of
a
securely
fastened
inside
the
ledge
and
capable
of
being
pulled
up
or
let
down
at
the
will
of
the
occupants
then
the
place
must
be
kept
constantly
stocked
with
a
judicious
supply
of
provisions
water
and
ammunition
they
could
be
covered
with
a
tarpaulin
and
thus
kept
in
fairly
good
condition
we
ought
to
sleep
there
every
night
he
went
on
and
his
mind
was
so
engrossed
with
the
tactical
side
of
the
preparations
that
he
did
not
notice
how
iris
blanched
at
the
suggestion
surely
not
until
danger
actually
threatens
she
cried
danger
threatens
us
each
hour
after
sunset
it
may
come
any
night
though
i
expect
at
least
a
fortnight
reprieve
nevertheless
i
intend
to
act
as
if
tonight
may
witness
the
first
shot
of
the
siege
do
you
mean
that
she
sighed
and
my
little
room
is
becoming
so
very
cozy
belle
vue
castle
their
hut
was
already
a
home
to
them
jenks
always
accepted
her
words
literally
well
he
announced
after
a
pause
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
take
up
our
quarters
there
until
the
eleventh
hour
after
i
have
hoisted
up
our
stores
and
made
the
ladder
i
will
endeavor
to
devise
an
efficient
cordon
of
sentinels
around
our
position
we
will
see
not
another
word
could
iris
get
out
of
him
on
the
topic
indeed
he
provided
her
with
plenty
of
work
by
this
time
she
could
splice
a
rope
more
neatly
than
her
tutor
and
her
particular
business
was
to
prepare
no
less
than
sixty
rungs
for
the
this
was
an
impossible
task
for
one
day
but
after
dinner
the
sailor
helped
her
they
toiled
late
until
their
fingers
were
sore
and
their
backbones
creaked
as
they
sat
upright
meanwhile
jenks
swarmed
up
the
pole
again
and
drew
up
after
him
a
crowbar
the
and
the
pickaxe
with
these
implements
he
set
to
work
to
improve
the
accommodation
of
course
he
did
not
attempt
seriously
to
remove
any
large
quantity
of
rock
but
there
were
projecting
lumps
here
and
inequalities
of
floor
there
which
could
be
thumped
or
pounded
out
of
existence
it
was
surprising
to
see
what
a
clearance
he
made
in
an
hour
the
existence
of
the
fault
helped
him
a
good
deal
as
the
percolation
of
water
at
this
point
had
oxidized
the
stone
to
rottenness
to
his
great
joy
he
discovered
that
a
few
prods
with
the
pick
laid
bare
a
small
cavity
which
could
be
easily
enlarged
here
he
contrived
a
niche
where
iris
could
remain
in
absolute
safety
when
barricaded
by
stores
whilst
with
a
squeeze
she
was
entirely
sheltered
from
the
one
dangerous
point
on
the
opposite
cliff
nor
need
she
be
seen
from
the
trees
having
hauled
into
position
two
boxes
of
ammunition
for
which
he
had
scooped
out
a
special
receptacle
the
invaluable
from
the
stranded
boat
several
tins
of
biscuits
and
all
the
tinned
meats
together
with
three
bottles
of
wine
and
two
of
brandy
he
hastily
abandoned
the
ledge
and
busied
himself
with
fitting
a
number
of
to
heavy
faggots
iris
watched
his
proceedings
in
silence
for
some
time
at
last
the
interval
for
luncheon
enabled
her
to
demand
an
explanation
if
you
do
tell
me
at
once
what
you
intend
to
do
with
those
strange
implements
she
said
i
will
form
myself
into
an
amalgamated
engineer
and
come
out
on
strike
if
you
do
he
answered
you
will
create
a
precedent
there
is
no
recorded
case
of
a
laborer
claiming
what
he
calls
his
rights
when
his
life
is
at
stake
even
an
american
tramp
has
been
known
to
work
like
a
fiend
under
that
condition
simply
because
an
american
tramp
tries
like
every
other
mere
male
to
be
logical
a
woman
is
more
heroic
i
once
read
of
a
french
lady
being
killed
during
an
earthquake
because
she
insisted
on
going
into
a
falling
house
to
rescue
that
portion
of
her
hair
which
usually
rested
on
the
whilst
she
was
asleep
i
happen
to
know
he
said
that
you
are
personally
unqualified
to
emulate
her
example
she
laughed
merrily
so
lightly
did
yesterday
adventure
sit
upon
her
the
allusion
to
her
disheveled
state
when
they
were
thrown
ashore
by
the
typhoon
simply
impressed
her
as
amusing
thus
quickly
had
she
become
inured
to
the
strange
circumstances
of
a
new
life
i
withdraw
the
threat
and
substitute
a
more
genuine
plea
curiosity
she
cried
then
you
will
be
gratified
promptly
these
are
our
sentinels
come
with
me
to
allot
his
post
to
the
most
distant
one
he
picked
up
a
faggot
with
its
queer
attachment
shouldered
a
and
smiled
when
he
saw
the
air
with
which
iris
slung
a
revolver
around
her
waist
they
walked
rapidly
to
smugglers
cove
and
the
girl
soon
perceived
the
ingenuity
of
his
automatic
signal
he
securely
bound
the
block
of
wood
to
a
tree
where
it
was
hidden
by
the
undergrowth
breaking
the
bullet
out
of
a
cartridge
he
placed
the
blank
charge
in
position
in
front
of
the
striker
the
case
being
firmly
clasped
by
a
bent
nail
to
the
trigger
the
spring
of
which
he
had
eased
to
a
slight
pressure
he
attached
a
piece
of
unraveled
rope
and
this
he
carefully
trained
among
the
trees
at
a
height
of
six
inches
from
the
ground
using
as
carriers
nails
driven
into
the
trunks
the
ultimate
result
was
that
a
mere
swish
of
iris
dress
against
the
taut
cord
exploded
the
cartridge
there
he
exclaimed
exultantly
when
i
have
driven
stakes
into
the
sand
to
the
water
edge
on
both
sides
of
the
cove
i
will
defy
them
to
land
by
night
without
giving
us
warning
do
you
know
said
iris
in
all
seriousness
i
think
you
are
the
cleverest
man
in
the
world
my
dear
miss
deane
that
is
not
at
all
a
trades
unionist
sentiment
equality
is
the
of
their
propaganda
nevertheless
he
was
manifestly
pleased
by
the
success
of
his
ingenious
contrivance
and
forthwith
completed
the
cordon
to
make
doubly
sure
he
set
another
snare
further
within
the
trees
he
was
certain
the
dyaks
would
not
pass
along
turtle
beach
if
they
could
help
it
by
this
time
the
light
was
failing
that
will
suffice
for
the
present
he
told
the
girl
tomorrow
we
will
place
other
sentries
in
position
at
strategic
points
then
we
can
sleep
in
the
castle
with
tolerable
safety
by
the
meager
light
of
the
tiny
lamp
they
labored
sedulously
at
the
until
iris
eyes
were
closing
with
sheer
weariness
neither
of
them
had
slept
much
during
the
preceding
night
and
they
were
both
completely
tired
it
was
with
a
very
weak
little
smile
that
the
girl
bade
him
good
night
and
they
were
soon
wrapped
in
that
sound
slumber
which
comes
only
from
health
hard
work
and
wholesome
fare
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
were
tipping
the
opposite
crags
with
roseate
tints
when
the
sailor
was
suddenly
aroused
by
what
he
believed
to
be
a
gunshot
he
could
not
be
sure
he
was
still
collecting
his
scattered
senses
straining
eyes
and
ears
intensely
when
there
came
a
second
report
then
he
knew
what
had
happened
the
sentries
on
the
smugglers
cove
post
were
faithful
to
their
trust
the
enemy
was
upon
them
at
such
a
moment
jenks
was
not
a
man
who
prayed
indeed
he
was
prone
to
invoke
the
nether
powers
a
habit
long
since
acquired
by
the
british
army
in
flanders
it
is
believed
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
he
rushed
into
iris
room
and
gathered
in
his
arms
both
her
and
the
weird
medley
of
garments
that
covered
her
he
explained
to
the
protesting
girl
as
he
ran
with
her
to
the
foot
of
the
rock
that
she
must
cling
to
his
shoulders
with
unfaltering
courage
whilst
he
climbed
to
the
ledge
with
the
aid
of
the
pole
and
the
rope
placed
there
the
previous
day
it
was
a
magnificent
feat
of
strength
that
he
essayed
in
calmer
moments
he
would
have
shrunk
from
its
performance
if
only
on
the
score
of
danger
to
the
precious
burden
he
carried
now
there
was
no
time
for
thought
up
he
went
hand
over
hand
clinging
to
the
rough
pole
with
the
tenacity
of
a
limpet
and
taking
a
turn
of
the
rope
over
his
right
wrist
at
each
upward
clutch
at
last
breathless
but
triumphant
he
reached
the
ledge
and
was
able
to
gasp
his
instructions
to
iris
to
crawl
over
his
bent
back
and
head
until
she
was
safely
lodged
on
the
broad
platform
of
rock
then
before
she
could
expostulate
he
descended
this
time
for
the
rifles
these
he
hastily
slung
to
the
rope
again
swarmed
up
the
pole
and
drew
the
guns
after
him
with
infinite
care
even
in
the
whirl
of
the
moment
he
noticed
that
iris
had
managed
to
partially
complete
her
costume
now
we
are
ready
for
them
he
growled
lying
prone
on
the
ledge
and
eagerly
scanning
both
sides
of
prospect
park
for
a
first
glimpse
of
their
assailants
for
two
shivering
hours
they
waited
there
until
the
sun
was
high
over
the
cliff
and
filled
sea
and
land
with
his
brightness
at
last
despite
the
girl
tears
and
prayers
jenks
insisted
on
making
a
reconnaissance
in
person
let
this
portion
of
their
adventures
be
passed
over
with
merciful
brevity
both
had
been
fired
by
the
troupe
of
tiny
monkeys
iris
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
when
jenks
with
much
difficulty
lowered
her
to
mother
earth
again
and
marveled
the
while
how
he
had
managed
to
carry
forty
feet
into
the
air
a
young
woman
who
weighed
so
solidly
they
sat
down
to
a
belated
breakfast
and
jenks
then
became
conscious
that
the
muscles
of
his
arms
legs
and
back
were
aching
hugely
it
was
by
that
means
he
could
judge
the
true
extent
of
his
achievement
iris
too
realized
it
gradually
but
like
the
frenchwoman
in
the
earthquake
she
was
too
concerned
with
memories
of
her
state
of
deshabille
to
appreciate
all
at
once
the
incidents
of
the
dawn
chapter
ix
the
secret
of
the
cave
the
sailor
went
after
those
monkeys
in
a
mood
of
relentless
severity
thus
far
the
regular
denizens
of
rainbow
island
had
dwelt
together
in
peace
and
mutual
goodwill
but
each
diminutive
must
be
taught
not
to
pull
any
strings
he
found
tied
promiscuously
to
trees
or
stakes
as
a
preliminary
essay
jenks
resolved
to
try
force
combined
with
artifice
failing
complete
success
he
would
endeavor
to
kill
every
monkey
in
the
place
though
he
had
in
full
measure
the
inherent
dislike
of
to
the
slaying
of
the
this
then
is
what
he
did
after
filling
a
biscuit
tin
with
pebbles
he
donned
a
dyak
hat
blouse
and
belt
rubbed
earth
over
his
face
and
hands
and
proceeded
to
pelt
the
mercilessly
for
more
than
an
hour
he
made
their
lives
miserable
until
at
the
mere
sight
of
him
they
fled
shrieking
and
gurgling
like
a
thousand
finally
he
constructed
several
dyak
scarecrows
and
erected
one
to
guard
each
of
his
the
device
was
thoroughly
effective
thenceforth
when
some
adventurous
monkey
swinging
with
hands
or
tail
among
the
treetops
in
the
morning
search
for
appetizing
nut
or
luscious
plantain
saw
one
of
those
fearsome
bogies
he
raised
such
a
hubbub
that
all
his
companions
scampered
hastily
from
the
confines
of
the
wood
to
the
inner
fastnesses
in
contriving
these
same
scarecrows
which
by
the
way
he
had
vaguely
intended
at
first
to
erect
on
the
beach
in
order
to
frighten
the
invaders
and
induce
them
to
fire
a
warning
volley
the
sailor
paid
closer
heed
to
the
spoils
gathered
from
the
fallen
one
at
least
of
the
belts
was
made
of
human
hair
and
some
among
its
long
strands
could
have
come
only
from
the
head
of
a
european
child
this
fact
though
ghastly
enough
confirmed
him
in
his
theory
that
it
was
impossible
to
think
of
temporizing
with
these
human
fiends
unhappily
such
savage
virtues
as
they
possess
do
not
include
clemency
to
the
weak
or
hospitality
to
defenceless
strangers
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
a
fight
to
a
finish
with
the
law
of
the
jungle
to
decide
the
terms
of
conquest
that
morning
of
course
he
had
not
been
able
to
visit
summit
rock
until
after
his
cautious
survey
of
the
island
once
there
however
he
noticed
that
the
gale
two
nights
earlier
had
loosened
two
of
the
supports
of
his
sky
sign
it
was
not
a
difficult
or
a
long
job
to
repair
the
damage
with
the
invaluable
axe
he
cut
several
wedges
and
soon
made
all
secure
now
during
each
of
the
two
daily
examinations
of
the
horizon
which
he
never
omitted
he
minutely
scrutinized
the
sea
between
rainbow
island
and
the
distant
group
it
was
perhaps
a
needless
precaution
the
dyaks
would
come
at
night
with
a
favorable
wind
they
need
not
set
sail
until
dusk
and
their
fleet
sampans
would
easily
cover
the
intervening
forty
miles
in
five
hours
he
could
not
be
positive
that
they
were
actual
inhabitants
of
the
islands
to
the
south
the
china
sea
swarms
with
wandering
pirates
and
the
tribe
whose
animosity
he
had
earned
might
be
equally
noxious
to
some
peaceable
fishing
community
on
the
coast
again
and
again
he
debated
the
advisability
of
constructing
a
seaworthy
raft
and
endeavoring
to
make
the
passage
but
this
would
be
risking
all
on
a
frightful
uncertainty
and
the
accidental
discovery
of
the
eagle
nest
had
given
him
new
hope
here
he
could
make
a
determined
and
prolonged
stand
and
in
the
end
help
come
so
he
dismissed
the
navigation
project
and
devoted
himself
wholly
to
the
perfecting
of
the
natural
fortress
in
the
rock
that
night
they
finished
the
indeed
jenks
was
determined
not
to
retire
to
rest
until
it
was
placed
he
did
not
care
to
try
a
second
time
to
carry
iris
to
that
elevated
perch
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
thenceforth
the
girl
before
going
to
sleep
simply
changed
one
ragged
dress
for
another
one
of
the
first
things
he
contemplated
was
the
destruction
if
possible
of
the
point
on
the
opposite
cliff
which
commanded
the
ledge
this
however
was
utterly
impracticable
with
the
appliances
at
his
command
the
top
of
the
rock
sloped
slightly
towards
the
west
and
nothing
short
of
dynamite
or
regular
quarrying
operations
would
render
it
untenable
by
hostile
marksmen
during
the
day
his
at
ninety
yards
range
might
be
trusted
to
keep
the
place
clear
of
intruders
but
at
night
that
was
the
difficulty
he
partially
solved
it
by
fixing
two
rests
on
the
ledge
to
support
a
rifle
in
exact
line
with
the
center
of
the
supposed
position
and
as
a
variant
on
the
outer
rest
he
marked
lines
which
corresponded
with
other
sections
of
the
entire
front
available
to
the
foe
even
then
he
was
not
satisfied
when
time
permitted
he
made
many
experiments
with
ropes
reeved
through
the
pulley
and
attached
to
a
rifle
action
he
might
have
succeeded
in
his
main
object
had
not
his
thoughts
taken
a
new
line
his
aim
was
to
achieve
some
method
of
opening
and
closing
the
by
means
of
two
ropes
the
difficulty
was
to
secure
the
preliminary
and
final
lateral
movement
of
the
lever
bolt
but
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
could
manage
to
convey
the
impression
that
iris
and
he
had
left
the
island
the
dyaks
would
go
away
after
a
fruitless
search
the
existence
of
ropes
along
the
face
of
the
rock
an
essential
to
his
mechanical
scheme
would
betray
their
whereabouts
or
at
any
rate
excite
dangerous
curiosity
so
he
reluctantly
abandoned
his
original
design
though
not
wholly
as
will
be
seen
in
due
course
in
pursuance
of
his
latest
idea
he
sedulously
removed
from
the
foot
of
the
cliff
all
traces
of
the
clearance
effected
on
the
ledge
and
although
he
provided
supports
for
the
tarpaulin
covering
he
did
not
adjust
it
iris
and
he
might
lie
there
for
days
without
their
retreat
being
found
out
this
development
suggested
the
necessity
of
hiding
their
surplus
stores
and
ammunition
and
what
spot
could
be
more
suitable
than
the
cave
so
jenks
began
to
dig
once
more
in
the
interior
laboring
manfully
with
pick
and
shovel
in
the
locality
of
the
fault
with
its
vein
of
antimony
it
was
thus
that
he
blundered
upon
the
second
great
event
of
his
life
rainbow
island
had
given
him
the
one
thing
a
man
prizes
above
all
else
a
pure
yet
passionate
love
for
a
woman
beautiful
alike
in
body
and
mind
and
now
it
was
to
endow
him
with
riches
that
might
stir
the
pulse
of
even
a
south
african
magnate
for
the
sailor
unmindful
of
purpose
other
than
providing
the
requisite
shoveling
and
delving
with
the
energy
peculiar
to
all
his
actions
suddenly
struck
a
deep
vein
of
almost
virgin
gold
to
facilitate
the
disposal
at
a
distance
of
the
disturbed
debris
he
threw
each
shovelful
on
to
a
canvas
sheet
which
he
subsequently
dragged
among
the
trees
in
order
to
dislodge
its
contents
after
doing
this
four
times
he
noticed
certain
metallic
specks
in
the
fifth
load
which
recalled
the
presence
of
the
antimony
but
the
appearance
of
the
sixth
cargo
was
so
remarkable
when
brought
out
into
the
sunlight
that
it
invited
closer
inspection
though
his
knowledge
of
geology
was
slight
the
gleanings
of
a
brief
course
at
eton
he
was
forced
to
believe
that
the
specimens
he
handled
so
dubiously
contained
neither
copper
nor
iron
pyrites
but
glittering
yellow
gold
their
weight
the
distribution
of
the
metal
through
quartz
in
a
transition
state
between
an
oxide
and
a
telluride
compelled
recognition
somewhat
excited
yet
half
skeptical
he
returned
to
the
excavation
and
scooped
out
yet
another
collection
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
nature
own
alchemy
had
fashioned
a
veritable
ingot
there
were
small
lumps
in
the
ore
which
would
need
alloy
at
the
mint
before
they
could
be
issued
as
sovereigns
so
free
from
dross
were
they
iris
had
gone
to
venus
bath
and
would
be
absent
for
some
time
jenks
sat
down
on
a
he
held
in
his
hand
a
small
bit
of
ore
worth
perhaps
twenty
pounds
sterling
slowly
the
conjectures
already
pieced
together
in
his
mind
during
early
days
on
the
island
came
back
to
him
the
skeleton
of
an
englishman
lying
there
among
the
bushes
near
the
well
the
golgotha
of
the
hollow
the
mining
tools
both
chinese
and
european
the
plan
on
the
piece
of
tin
ah
the
piece
of
tin
mechanically
the
sailor
produced
it
from
the
of
his
jersey
at
last
the
mysterious
sign
revealed
its
significance
measure
feet
from
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
dig
one
foot
in
depth
and
you
came
upon
the
of
this
rock
this
then
was
the
secret
of
the
cave
the
chinese
knew
the
richness
of
the
deposit
and
exploited
its
treasures
by
quarrying
from
the
other
side
of
the
hill
but
their
crass
ignorance
of
modern
science
led
to
their
undoing
the
accumulation
of
liberated
carbonic
acid
gas
in
the
workings
killed
them
in
scores
they
probably
fought
this
unseen
demon
with
the
tenacity
of
their
race
until
the
place
became
accursed
and
banned
of
all
living
things
yet
had
they
dug
a
little
ditch
and
permitted
the
invisible
terror
to
flow
quietly
downwards
until
its
potency
was
dissipated
by
sea
and
air
they
might
have
mined
the
whole
cliff
with
impunity
the
unfortunate
unknown
he
of
the
whitened
bones
might
have
done
this
thing
too
but
he
only
possessed
the
of
the
working
miner
and
whilst
shunning
the
quarry
adopted
the
more
laborious
method
of
making
an
adit
to
strike
the
deposit
he
succeeded
to
perish
miserably
in
the
hour
when
he
saw
himself
a
millionaire
was
this
a
portent
of
the
fate
about
to
overtake
the
latest
comers
jenks
of
course
stood
up
he
always
stood
square
on
his
feet
when
the
volcano
within
him
fired
his
blood
no
by
god
he
almost
shouted
i
will
break
the
spell
i
am
sent
here
by
providence
not
to
search
for
gold
but
to
save
a
woman
life
and
if
all
the
devils
of
china
and
malay
are
in
league
against
me
i
will
beat
them
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
startled
him
he
had
no
notion
that
he
was
so
hysterical
promptly
his
british
phlegm
throttled
the
demonstration
he
was
rather
ashamed
of
it
what
was
all
the
fuss
about
with
a
of
gold
he
could
not
buy
an
instant
safety
for
iris
not
to
mention
himself
the
language
difficulty
was
insuperable
were
it
otherwise
the
dyaks
would
simply
humbug
him
until
he
revealed
the
source
of
his
wealth
and
then
murder
him
as
an
effective
safeguard
against
foreign
interference
iris
not
once
since
she
was
hurled
ashore
in
his
arms
had
jenks
so
long
forgotten
her
existence
should
he
tell
her
they
were
partners
in
everything
appertaining
to
the
island
why
keep
this
marvelous
intelligence
from
her
yet
was
he
tempted
not
ignobly
but
by
reason
of
his
love
for
her
once
years
ago
when
his
arduous
professional
studies
were
distracted
by
a
momentary
infatuation
for
a
fair
face
a
woman
had
proved
fickle
when
tempted
by
greater
wealth
than
he
possessed
for
long
he
was
a
confirmed
misogynist
to
his
great
and
lasting
gain
as
a
leader
of
men
but
with
more
equable
judgment
came
a
fixed
resolution
not
to
marry
unless
his
prospective
bride
cared
only
for
him
and
not
for
his
position
to
a
staff
corps
officer
even
one
with
a
small
private
income
this
was
no
unattainable
ideal
then
he
met
with
his
in
the
shame
and
agony
of
the
whilst
his
soul
still
quivered
under
the
lash
of
that
terrible
downfall
iris
came
into
his
life
he
knew
not
what
might
happen
if
they
were
rescued
the
time
would
quickly
pass
until
the
old
order
was
resumed
she
to
go
back
to
her
position
in
society
he
to
become
again
a
disgraced
apparently
working
out
a
mere
existence
before
the
mast
or
handing
plates
in
a
saloon
would
it
not
be
a
sweet
defiance
of
adversity
were
he
able
even
under
such
conditions
to
win
her
love
and
then
disclose
to
her
the
potentialities
of
the
island
perchance
he
might
fail
though
rich
as
croesus
he
would
still
be
under
the
social
ban
meted
out
to
a
cashiered
officer
she
was
a
girl
who
could
command
the
gift
of
coronets
with
restoration
to
her
father
and
home
gratitude
to
her
preserver
would
assuredly
remain
but
alas
love
might
vanish
like
a
mirage
then
he
would
act
honorably
half
of
the
stored
wealth
would
be
hers
to
do
as
she
chose
with
it
yes
this
was
a
possible
alternative
in
case
of
accident
to
himself
and
her
ultimate
escape
he
must
immediately
write
full
details
of
his
discovery
and
entrust
the
document
to
her
to
be
opened
only
after
his
death
or
six
months
after
their
release
the
idea
possessed
him
so
thoroughly
that
he
could
brook
no
delay
he
searched
for
one
of
the
taken
from
the
dead
officers
of
the
and
scribbled
the
following
letter
dear
miss
deane
whether
i
am
living
or
dead
when
you
read
these
words
you
will
know
that
i
love
you
could
i
repeat
that
avowal
a
million
times
in
as
many
varied
forms
i
should
find
no
better
phrase
to
express
the
dream
i
have
cherished
since
a
happy
fate
permitted
me
to
snatch
you
from
death
so
i
simply
say
love
you
i
will
continue
to
love
you
whilst
life
lasts
and
it
is
my
dearest
hope
that
in
the
life
beyond
the
grave
i
may
still
be
able
to
voice
my
love
for
you
but
perhaps
i
am
not
destined
to
be
loved
by
you
therefore
in
the
event
of
my
death
before
you
leave
the
island
i
wish
to
give
you
instructions
how
to
find
a
gold
mine
of
great
value
which
is
hidden
in
the
rock
containing
the
cave
you
remember
the
sign
on
the
piece
of
tin
which
we
could
not
understand
the
figure
denotes
the
utmost
depth
of
the
excavation
and
the
signifies
that
one
foot
below
the
surface
on
reaching
the
face
of
the
rock
there
is
a
rich
vein
of
gold
the
hollow
on
the
other
side
of
the
cliff
became
filled
with
anhydrate
gas
and
this
stopped
the
operations
of
the
chinese
who
evidently
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
mine
this
is
all
the
information
the
experts
employed
by
sir
arthur
deane
will
need
the
facts
are
unquestionable
assuming
that
i
am
alive
we
will
of
course
be
in
the
mine
if
i
am
dead
i
wish
share
to
be
given
to
my
uncle
william
anstruther
crossthwaite
manor
northallerton
yorkshire
as
a
recompense
for
his
kindness
to
me
during
my
early
life
the
remainder
is
to
be
yours
absolutely
robert
anstruther
he
read
this
remarkable
document
twice
through
to
make
sure
that
it
exactly
recorded
his
sentiments
he
even
smiled
sarcastically
at
the
endowment
of
the
uncle
who
disinherited
him
then
satisfied
with
the
perusal
he
tore
out
the
two
leaves
covered
by
the
letter
and
began
to
devise
a
means
of
protecting
it
securely
whilst
in
iris
possession
at
that
moment
he
looked
up
and
saw
her
coming
towards
him
across
the
beach
brightly
flushed
after
her
bath
walking
like
a
nymph
clothed
in
tattered
garments
perceiving
that
he
was
watching
her
she
waved
her
hand
and
instinctively
quickened
her
pace
even
now
when
they
were
thrown
together
by
the
exigencies
of
each
hour
she
disliked
to
be
long
separated
from
him
instantly
the
scales
fell
from
his
mental
vision
what
distrust
iris
imagine
for
one
second
that
riches
or
poverty
good
repute
or
ill
would
affect
that
loyal
heart
when
its
virginal
font
was
filled
with
the
love
that
once
in
her
life
comes
to
every
true
woman
perish
the
thought
what
evil
spirit
had
power
to
so
blind
his
perception
of
all
that
was
strong
and
beautiful
in
her
character
brave
uncomplaining
iris
iris
of
the
crystal
soul
iris
whose
innocence
and
candor
were
mirrored
in
her
blue
eyes
and
breathed
through
her
dear
lips
here
was
othello
acting
as
his
own
tempter
with
not
an
iago
within
a
thousand
miles
laughing
at
his
fantastic
folly
jenks
tore
the
letter
into
little
pieces
it
might
have
been
wiser
to
throw
the
sheets
into
the
embers
of
the
fire
close
at
hand
but
for
the
nonce
he
was
overpowered
by
the
great
awakening
that
had
come
to
him
and
he
unconsciously
murmured
the
musical
lines
of
tennyson
maud
she
is
coming
my
own
my
sweet
were
it
ever
so
airy
a
tread
my
heart
would
hear
her
and
beat
were
it
earth
in
an
earthy
bed
my
dust
would
hear
her
and
beat
had
i
lain
for
a
century
dead
would
start
and
tremble
under
her
feet
and
blossom
in
purple
and
red
good
gracious
do
gaze
at
me
in
that
fashion
i
do
look
like
a
ghost
do
i
cried
iris
when
near
enough
to
note
his
rapt
expression
you
would
not
object
if
i
called
you
a
vision
he
inquired
quietly
averting
his
eyes
lest
they
should
speak
more
plainly
than
his
tongue
not
if
you
meant
it
nicely
but
i
fear
that
would
be
a
more
appropriate
word
ma
meilleure
robe
de
she
spread
out
the
front
widths
of
her
skirt
and
certainly
the
prospect
was
lamentable
the
dress
was
so
patched
and
mended
yet
so
full
of
fresh
rents
that
a
respectable
housemaid
would
hesitate
before
using
it
to
clean
is
that
really
your
best
dress
he
said
yes
this
is
my
blue
serge
the
brown
cloth
did
not
survive
the
soaking
it
received
in
salt
water
after
a
few
days
it
simply
crumbled
the
others
are
muslin
or
cotton
and
have
been
er
adapted
there
is
plenty
of
men
clothing
he
began
unfortunately
there
is
another
island
she
said
severely
no
i
meant
that
it
might
be
possible
to
er
contrive
some
sort
of
rig
that
will
serve
all
purposes
but
all
my
thread
is
gone
i
have
barely
a
needleful
left
in
that
case
we
must
fall
back
on
our
supply
of
hemp
i
suppose
that
might
be
made
to
serve
she
said
you
are
never
at
a
loss
for
an
expedient
it
will
be
a
poor
one
i
fear
but
you
can
make
up
for
it
by
buying
some
nice
gowns
at
doucet
or
worth
she
laughed
delightedly
perhaps
in
his
joy
at
my
reappearance
my
dear
old
dad
may
let
me
run
riot
in
paris
on
our
way
home
but
that
will
not
last
we
are
fairly
well
off
but
i
can
not
afford
ten
thousand
a
year
for
dress
alone
if
any
woman
can
afford
such
a
sum
for
the
purpose
you
are
at
least
her
equal
iris
looked
puzzled
is
that
your
way
of
telling
me
that
fine
feathers
would
make
me
a
fine
bird
she
asked
no
i
intend
my
words
to
be
understood
in
their
ordinary
sense
you
are
very
very
rich
miss
deane
an
extravagantly
wealthy
young
person
of
course
you
know
you
are
talking
nonsense
why
only
the
other
day
my
father
said
excuse
me
what
is
the
average
price
of
a
from
a
leading
paris
house
thirty
pounds
and
an
evening
dress
oh
anything
from
fifty
upwards
he
picked
up
a
few
pieces
of
quartz
from
the
canvas
sheet
here
is
your
he
said
handing
her
a
lump
weighing
about
a
pound
with
the
balance
in
the
heap
there
you
can
stagger
the
woman
you
meet
at
your
first
dinner
in
england
do
you
mean
by
pelting
her
she
inquired
mischievously
far
worse
by
wearing
a
more
expensive
costume
his
manner
was
so
earnest
that
he
compelled
seriousness
iris
took
the
proffered
specimen
and
looked
at
it
from
the
cave
i
suppose
i
thought
you
said
antimony
was
not
very
valuable
that
is
not
antimony
it
is
gold
by
chance
i
have
hit
upon
an
extremely
rich
lode
of
gold
at
the
most
modest
computation
it
is
worth
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
you
and
i
are
quite
wealthy
people
miss
deane
iris
opened
her
blue
eyes
very
wide
at
this
intelligence
it
took
her
breath
away
but
her
first
words
betokened
her
innate
sense
of
fair
dealing
you
and
i
wealthy
she
gasped
i
am
so
glad
for
your
sake
but
tell
me
pray
jenks
what
have
got
to
do
with
it
you
he
repeated
are
we
not
partners
in
this
island
by
right
if
by
no
better
title
we
own
land
minerals
wood
game
and
even
such
weird
belongings
as
ancient
lights
and
fishing
privileges
i
do
see
that
at
all
you
find
a
gold
mine
and
coolly
tell
me
that
i
am
a
half
owner
of
it
because
you
dragged
me
out
of
the
sea
fed
me
housed
me
saved
my
life
from
pirates
and
generally
acted
like
a
devoted
nursemaid
in
charge
of
a
baby
really
jenks
really
miss
deane
you
will
annoy
me
seriously
if
you
say
another
word
i
absolutely
refuse
to
listen
to
such
an
argument
her
outrageously
utterances
treading
fast
on
the
heels
of
his
own
melodramatic
and
written
views
concerning
their
property
nettled
him
greatly
each
downright
syllable
was
a
sting
to
his
conscience
but
of
this
iris
was
blissfully
unaware
else
she
would
not
have
applied
caustic
to
the
rankling
wound
caused
by
his
momentary
distrust
of
her
for
some
time
they
stood
in
silence
until
the
sailor
commenced
to
reproach
himself
for
his
rough
protest
perhaps
he
had
hurt
her
sensitive
feelings
what
a
brute
he
was
to
be
sure
she
was
only
a
child
in
ordinary
affairs
and
he
ought
to
have
explained
things
more
lucidly
and
with
greater
command
over
his
temper
and
all
this
time
iris
face
was
dimpling
with
amusement
for
she
understood
him
so
well
that
had
he
threatened
to
kill
her
she
would
have
laughed
at
him
would
you
mind
getting
the
lamp
he
said
softly
surprised
to
catch
her
expression
of
saucy
humor
oh
please
may
i
speak
she
inquired
i
do
want
to
annoy
you
but
i
am
simply
dying
to
talk
he
had
forgotten
his
own
injunction
let
us
first
examine
our
mine
he
said
if
you
bring
the
lamp
we
can
have
a
good
look
at
it
close
scrutiny
of
the
work
already
done
merely
confirmed
the
accuracy
of
his
first
impressions
whilst
iris
held
the
light
he
opened
up
the
seam
with
a
few
strokes
of
the
pick
each
few
inches
it
broadened
into
a
noteworthy
volcanic
dyke
now
yellow
in
its
absolute
purity
at
times
a
bluish
black
when
fused
with
other
metals
the
additional
labor
involved
caused
him
to
follow
up
the
line
of
the
fault
suddenly
the
flame
of
the
lamp
began
to
flicker
in
a
draught
there
was
an
between
cave
and
ledge
i
am
sorry
cried
jenks
desisting
from
further
efforts
that
i
have
not
recently
read
one
of
bret
harte
novels
or
i
would
speak
to
you
in
the
language
of
the
mining
camp
but
in
plain
cockney
miss
deane
we
are
on
to
a
good
thing
if
only
we
can
keep
it
they
came
back
into
the
external
glare
iris
was
now
so
serious
that
she
forgot
to
extinguish
the
little
lamp
she
stood
with
outstretched
hand
there
is
a
lot
of
money
in
there
she
said
tons
of
it
no
need
to
quarrel
about
division
there
is
enough
for
both
of
us
quite
enough
we
can
even
spare
some
for
our
friends
he
took
so
readily
to
this
definition
of
their
partnership
that
iris
suddenly
became
frigid
then
she
saw
the
ridiculous
gleam
of
the
tiny
wick
and
blew
it
out
i
mean
she
said
stiffly
that
if
you
and
i
do
agree
to
go
shares
we
will
each
be
very
rich
exactly
i
applied
your
words
to
the
mine
alone
of
course
a
slight
thing
will
shatter
a
daydream
this
sufficed
the
sailor
resumed
his
task
of
burying
the
stores
poor
little
lamp
he
thought
when
it
came
into
the
greater
world
how
soon
it
was
snuffed
out
but
iris
said
to
herself
what
a
silly
slip
that
was
of
mine
enough
for
both
of
us
indeed
does
he
expect
me
to
propose
to
him
i
wonder
what
the
letter
was
about
which
he
destroyed
as
i
came
back
after
my
bath
it
must
have
been
meant
for
me
why
did
he
write
it
why
did
he
tear
it
up
the
hour
drew
near
when
jenks
climbed
to
the
summit
rock
he
shouldered
axe
and
rifle
and
set
forth
iris
heard
him
rustling
upwards
through
the
trees
she
set
some
water
to
boil
for
tea
and
whilst
bringing
a
fresh
supply
of
fuel
passed
the
spot
where
the
torn
scraps
of
paper
littered
the
sand
she
was
the
soul
of
honor
for
a
woman
but
there
was
never
a
woman
yet
who
could
take
her
eyes
off
a
written
document
which
confronted
her
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
one
small
morsel
contained
her
own
name
though
mutilated
it
had
clearly
read
miss
deane
so
it
intended
for
me
she
cried
throwing
down
her
bundle
and
dropping
to
her
knees
she
secured
that
particular
slip
and
examined
it
earnestly
not
for
worlds
would
she
pick
up
all
the
scraps
and
endeavor
to
sort
them
yet
they
had
a
fascination
for
her
and
at
this
closer
range
she
saw
another
which
bore
the
legend
i
love
you
somehow
the
two
seemed
to
fit
together
very
nicely
yet
a
third
carried
the
same
words
i
love
you
they
were
still
quite
coherent
she
did
not
want
to
look
any
further
she
did
not
even
turn
over
such
of
the
torn
pieces
as
had
fluttered
to
earth
face
downwards
opening
the
front
of
her
bodice
she
brought
to
light
a
small
gold
locket
containing
miniatures
of
her
father
and
mother
inside
this
receptacle
she
carefully
placed
the
three
really
material
portions
of
the
sailor
letter
when
jenks
walked
down
the
hill
again
he
heard
her
singing
long
before
he
caught
sight
of
her
sedulously
tending
the
fire
as
he
came
near
he
perceived
the
remains
of
his
useless
document
he
stooped
and
gathered
them
up
forthwith
throwing
them
among
the
glowing
logs
by
the
way
what
were
you
writing
whilst
i
had
my
bath
inquired
iris
demurely
some
information
about
the
mine
on
second
thoughts
however
i
saw
it
was
unnecessary
oh
was
that
all
practically
all
then
some
part
was
impracticable
he
glanced
sharply
at
her
but
she
was
merely
talking
at
random
well
you
see
he
explained
one
can
do
so
little
without
the
requisite
plant
this
sort
of
ore
requires
a
a
smelting
furnace
perhaps
big
tanks
filled
with
cyanide
of
potassium
and
of
course
although
you
can
do
wonders
you
can
not
provide
all
those
things
can
you
jenks
deemed
this
query
to
be
unanswerable
they
were
busy
again
until
night
fell
sitting
down
for
a
little
while
before
retiring
to
rest
they
discussed
for
the
hundredth
time
the
probabilities
of
speedy
succor
this
led
them
to
the
topic
of
available
supplies
and
the
sailor
told
iris
the
dispositions
he
had
made
did
you
bury
the
box
of
books
she
asked
yes
but
not
in
the
cave
they
are
at
the
foot
of
the
cinchona
over
there
why
do
you
want
any
i
have
a
bible
in
my
room
but
there
was
a
tennyson
among
the
others
which
i
glanced
at
in
spare
moments
the
sailor
thanked
the
darkness
that
concealed
the
deep
bronze
of
face
and
neck
caused
by
this
chance
remark
he
vaguely
recollected
the
manner
in
which
the
lines
from
maud
came
to
his
lips
after
the
episode
of
the
letter
was
it
possible
that
he
had
unknowingly
uttered
them
aloud
and
iris
was
now
slily
poking
fun
at
him
he
glowed
with
embarrassment
it
is
odd
that
you
should
mention
tennyson
he
managed
to
say
calmly
only
today
i
was
thinking
of
a
favorite
passage
iris
of
course
was
quite
innocent
this
time
oh
do
tell
me
was
it
from
arden
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
no
anything
but
that
he
answered
what
then
oh
it
is
very
beautiful
but
i
could
never
imagine
why
the
poet
gave
such
a
sad
ending
to
an
idyllic
love
story
they
too
often
end
that
way
moreover
arden
is
not
what
you
might
call
exhilarating
no
it
is
sad
i
have
often
thought
he
had
the
pathétique
in
his
mind
when
he
wrote
it
but
the
note
is
mournful
all
through
there
is
no
promise
of
happiness
as
in
then
it
is
my
turn
to
ask
questions
why
did
you
hit
upon
that
poem
among
so
many
because
it
contains
an
exact
description
of
our
position
here
you
remember
how
the
poor
fellow
often
in
the
gorge
a
shipwrecked
sailor
waiting
for
a
sail
i
am
sure
tennyson
saw
our
island
with
poetic
eye
for
he
goes
on
sail
from
day
to
day
but
every
day
the
sunrise
broken
into
scarlet
shafts
among
the
palms
and
ferns
and
precipices
the
blaze
upon
the
waters
to
the
east
the
blaze
upon
his
island
overhead
the
blaze
upon
the
waters
to
the
west
then
the
great
stars
that
globed
themselves
in
heaven
the
ocean
and
again
the
scarlet
shafts
of
sunrise
but
no
sail
she
declaimed
the
melodious
verse
with
a
subtle
skill
that
amazed
her
hearer
profoundly
moved
jenks
dared
not
trust
himself
to
speak
i
read
the
whole
poem
the
other
day
she
said
after
a
silence
of
some
minutes
sorrowful
as
it
is
it
comforted
me
by
comparison
how
different
will
be
our
fate
to
his
when
ship
stays
by
this
isle
yet
neither
of
them
knew
that
one
line
she
had
recited
was
more
singularly
applicable
to
their
case
than
that
which
they
paid
heed
to
the
great
stars
that
globed
themselves
in
heaven
were
shining
clear
and
bright
in
the
vast
arch
above
resplendent
amidst
the
throng
rose
the
pleiades
the
mythological
seven
hailed
by
the
greeks
as
an
augury
of
safe
navigation
and
the
dyaks
one
of
the
few
remaining
savage
races
of
the
world
share
the
superstition
of
the
people
who
fashioned
all
the
arts
and
most
of
the
sciences
the
pleiades
form
the
dyak
tutelary
genius
some
among
a
bloodthirsty
and
vengeful
horde
were
even
then
pointing
to
the
clustering
stars
that
promised
quick
voyage
to
the
isle
where
their
kinsmen
had
been
struck
down
by
a
white
man
who
rescued
a
maid
nevertheless
grecian
romance
and
dyak
lore
alike
relegate
the
influence
of
the
pleiades
to
the
sea
other
stars
are
needed
to
foster
enterprise
ashore
chapter
x

romance
the
case
for
the
plaintiff
night
after
night
the
pleiades
swung
higher
in
the
firmament
day
after
day
the
sailor
perfected
his
defences
and
anxiously
scanned
the
ocean
for
sign
of
friendly
smoke
or
hostile
sail
this
respite
would
not
have
been
given
to
him
were
it
not
for
the
lucky
bullet
which
removed
two
fingers
and
part
of
a
third
from
the
right
hand
of
the
dyak
chief
not
even
a
healthy
savage
can
afford
to
treat
such
a
wound
lightly
and
ten
days
elapsed
before
the
maimed
robber
was
able
to
move
the
injured
limb
without
a
curse
meanwhile
each
night
jenks
slept
less
soundly
each
day
his
face
became
more
careworn
he
began
to
realize
why
the
island
had
not
been
visited
already
by
the
vessel
which
would
certainly
be
deputed
to
search
for
them
she
was
examining
the
great
of
china
and
siam
it
was
his
habit
to
mark
the
progress
of
time
on
the
rudely
made
which
sufficiently
served
their
requirements
as
a
clock
iris
happened
to
watch
him
chipping
the
notch
on
the
edge
of
the
horizontal
block
of
wood
have
we
really
been
days
here
she
inquired
after
counting
the
marks
with
growing
astonishment
i
believe
the
reckoning
is
accurate
he
said
the
was
lost
on
the
of
march
and
i
make
this
the
of
may
may
day
yes
shall
we
drive
to
hurlingham
this
afternoon
looked
at
in
that
way
it
seems
to
be
a
tremendous
time
though
indeed
in
some
respects
it
figures
in
my
mind
like
many
years
that
is
when
i
am
thinking
otherwise
when
busy
the
days
fly
like
hours
it
must
be
convenient
to
have
such
an
elastic
scale
most
useful
i
strive
to
apply
the
quick
rate
when
you
are
grumpy
iris
placed
her
arms
akimbo
planted
her
feet
widely
apart
and
surveyed
jenks
with
an
expression
that
might
almost
be
termed
impudent
they
were
great
friends
these
two
now
the
incipient
stage
of
had
been
dropped
entirely
as
ludicrously
unsuited
to
their
environment
when
the
urgent
necessity
for
continuous
labor
no
longer
spurred
them
to
exertion
during
every
moment
of
daylight
they
tackled
the
box
of
books
and
read
not
volumes
which
appealed
to
them
in
common
but
quaint
tomes
in
the
use
of
which
jenks
was
tutor
and
iris
the
scholar
it
became
a
fixed
principle
with
the
girl
that
she
was
very
ignorant
and
she
insisted
that
the
sailor
should
teach
her
for
instance
among
the
books
he
found
a
treatise
on
astronomy
it
yielded
a
keen
delight
to
both
to
identify
a
constellation
and
learn
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
concerning
it
but
to
work
even
the
simplest
problem
required
a
knowledge
of
algebra
and
iris
had
never
gone
beyond
decimals
so
the
stock
of
notebooks
instead
of
recording
their
experiences
became
covered
with
symbols
showing
how
x
plus
y
equaled
minus
as
a
variant
jenks
introduced
a
study
of
hindustani
his
method
was
to
write
a
short
sentence
and
explain
in
detail
its
component
parts
with
a
certain
awe
iris
surveyed
the
intricacies
of
the
urdu
compound
verb
but
about
her
fourth
lesson
she
broke
out
into
exclamations
of
extravagant
joy
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
now
demanded
her
surprised
mentor
do
you
see
she
exclaimed
delightedly
of
course
you
do
people
who
know
a
lot
about
a
thing
often
miss
its
obvious
points
i
have
discovered
how
to
write
kiplingese
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
tell
your
story
in
urdu
translate
it
literally
into
english
and
there
you
are
quite
so
just
do
it
as
kipling
does
and
the
secret
is
laid
bare
by
the
same
rule
you
can
hit
upon
the
miltonic
adjective
iris
tossed
her
head
i
do
know
anything
about
the
miltonic
adjective
but
i
am
sure
about
kipling
this
ended
the
argument
she
knitted
her
brows
in
the
effort
to
master
the
ridiculous
complexities
of
a
language
which
instead
of
simply
saying
take
or
bring
compels
one
to
say
and
one
problem
defied
solution
that
of
providing
raiment
for
iris
the
united
skill
of
the
sailor
and
herself
would
not
induce
unraveled
cordage
to
supply
the
need
of
thread
it
was
either
too
weak
or
too
knotty
and
meanwhile
the
girl
clothes
were
falling
to
pieces
jenks
tried
the
fibers
of
trees
the
sinews
of
birds
every
possible
expedient
he
could
hit
upon
and
perhaps
after
experiments
covering
some
weeks
he
might
have
succeeded
but
modern
dress
stuffs
weakened
by
aniline
dyes
and
stiffened
with
chinese
clay
permit
of
no
such
exhaustive
research
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
lady
passengers
on
board
the
were
dressed
to
suit
the
tropics
and
the
hard
usage
given
by
iris
to
her
scanty
stock
was
never
contemplated
by
the
manchester
or
bradford
looms
responsible
for
the
durability
of
the
material
as
the
days
passed
the
position
became
irksome
it
even
threatened
complete
callapse
during
some
critical
moment
and
the
two
often
silently
surveyed
the
large
number
of
merely
male
garments
in
their
possession
of
course
in
the
matter
of
coats
and
waistcoats
there
was
no
difficulty
whatever
iris
had
long
been
wearing
those
portions
of
the
doctor
uniform
but
when
it
came
to
the
rest
at
last
one
memorable
morning
she
crossed
the
rubicon
jenks
had
climbed
as
usual
to
the
summit
rock
he
came
back
with
the
exciting
news
that
he
thought
he
could
not
be
certain
but
there
were
indications
inspiring
hopefulness
that
towards
the
west
of
the
island
he
could
discern
the
smoke
of
a
steamer
though
he
had
eyes
for
a
faint
cloud
of
vapor
at
least
fifty
miles
distant
he
saw
nothing
of
a
remarkable
change
effected
nearer
home
outwardly
iris
was
attired
in
her
wonted
manner
but
if
her
companion
mind
were
not
wholly
monopolized
by
the
bluish
haze
detected
on
the
horizon
he
must
have
noticed
the
ends
of
a
pair
of
trousers
beneath
the
hem
of
her
tattered
skirt
it
did
occur
to
him
that
iris
received
his
momentous
announcement
with
an
odd
air
of
hauteur
and
it
was
passing
strange
she
did
not
offer
to
accompany
him
when
after
bolting
his
breakfast
he
returned
to
the
observatory
he
came
back
in
an
hour
and
the
lines
on
his
face
were
deeper
than
before
a
false
alarm
he
said
curtly
in
response
to
her
questioning
look
and
that
was
all
though
she
nerved
herself
to
walk
steadily
past
him
on
her
way
to
the
well
this
was
disconcerting
even
annoying
to
a
positive
young
woman
like
iris
resolving
to
end
the
ordeal
she
stood
rigidly
before
him
well
she
said
i
done
it
have
you
he
exclaimed
blankly
yes
they
a
little
too
long
and
i
feel
very
awkward
but
better
than
than
my
poor
old
dress
unsupported
she
blushed
furiously
to
the
sailor
complete
bewilderment
but
she
bravely
persevered
and
stretched
out
an
unwilling
foot
oh
i
see
he
growled
and
he
too
reddened
i
ca
help
it
can
i
she
demanded
piteously
it
is
not
unlike
a
is
it
then
his
ready
wit
helped
him
an
excellent
compromise
he
cried
a
process
of
evolution
in
fact
now
do
you
know
miss
deane
that
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
and
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
he
did
not
once
look
at
her
feet
indeed
he
had
far
more
serious
matters
to
distract
his
thoughts
for
iris
feverishly
anxious
to
be
busy
suddenly
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
were
she
able
to
use
a
rifle
if
a
fight
at
close
quarters
became
necessary
the
recoil
of
the
is
so
slight
that
any
woman
can
manipulate
the
weapon
with
effect
provided
she
is
not
called
upon
to
fire
from
a
standing
position
in
which
case
the
weight
is
liable
to
cause
bad
aiming
though
it
came
rather
late
in
the
day
jenks
caught
at
the
idea
he
accustomed
her
in
the
first
instance
to
the
use
of
blank
cartridges
then
when
fairly
proficient
in
holding
and
sighting
a
child
can
learn
how
to
refill
the
clip
and
eject
each
empty
shell
she
fired
ten
rounds
of
service
ammunition
the
target
was
a
white
circle
on
a
rock
at
eighty
yards
and
those
of
the
ten
shots
that
missed
the
absolute
mark
would
have
made
an
enemy
at
the
same
distance
extremely
uncomfortable
iris
was
much
pleased
with
her
proficiency
now
she
cried
instead
of
being
a
hindrance
to
you
i
may
be
some
help
in
any
case
the
dyaks
will
think
there
are
two
men
to
face
and
they
have
good
reason
to
fear
one
of
us
then
a
new
light
dawned
upon
jenks
why
did
you
not
think
of
it
before
he
demanded
do
you
see
miss
deane
the
possibility
suggested
by
your
words
i
am
sorry
to
be
compelled
to
speak
plainly
but
i
feel
sure
that
if
those
scoundrels
do
attack
us
in
force
it
will
be
more
to
secure
you
than
to
avenge
the
loss
of
their
fellow
tribesmen
first
and
foremost
the
dyaks
are
pirates
and
marauders
they
prowl
about
the
coast
looking
not
so
much
for
a
fight
as
for
loot
and
women
now
if
they
return
and
apparently
find
two
men
awaiting
them
with
no
prospect
of
plunder
there
is
a
chance
they
may
abandon
the
enterprise
iris
did
not
flinch
from
the
topic
she
well
knew
its
grave
importance
in
other
words
she
said
i
must
be
seen
by
them
dressed
only
in
male
clothing
yes
as
a
last
resource
that
is
i
have
some
hope
that
they
may
not
discover
our
whereabouts
owing
to
the
precautions
we
have
adopted
perched
up
there
on
the
ledge
we
will
be
profoundly
uncomfortable
but
that
will
be
nothing
if
it
secures
our
safety
she
did
not
reply
at
once
then
she
said
musingly
days
surely
there
has
been
ample
time
to
scour
the
china
sea
from
end
to
end
in
search
of
us
my
father
would
never
abandon
hope
until
he
had
the
most
positive
knowledge
that
the
was
lost
with
all
on
board
the
sailor
through
long
schooling
was
prepared
with
an
answer
each
day
makes
the
prospect
of
escape
brighter
though
i
was
naturally
disappointed
this
morning
i
must
state
quite
emphatically
that
our
rescue
may
come
any
hour
iris
looked
at
him
steadily
you
wear
a
solemn
face
for
one
who
speaks
so
cheerfully
she
said
you
should
not
attach
too
great
significance
to
appearances
the
owl
a
very
stupid
bird
is
noted
for
its
philosophical
expression
then
we
will
strive
to
find
wisdom
in
words
do
you
remember
jenks
that
soon
after
the
wreck
you
told
me
we
might
have
to
remain
here
many
months
that
was
a
pardonable
exaggeration
no
no
it
was
the
truth
you
are
seeking
now
to
buoy
me
up
with
false
hope
it
is
sixteen
hundred
miles
from
hong
kong
to
singapore
and
half
as
much
from
siam
to
borneo
the
might
have
been
driven
anywhere
in
the
typhoon
did
you
say
so
mr
jenks
he
wavered
under
this
merciless
i
had
no
idea
your
memory
was
so
good
he
said
weakly
excellent
i
assure
you
moreover
during
our
days
together
you
have
taught
me
to
think
why
do
you
adopt
subterfuge
with
me
we
are
partners
in
all
else
why
can
not
i
share
your
despair
as
well
as
your
toil
she
blazed
out
in
sudden
wrath
and
he
understood
that
she
would
not
be
denied
the
full
extent
of
his
secret
fear
he
bowed
reverently
before
her
as
a
mortal
paying
homage
to
an
angry
goddess
i
can
only
admit
that
you
are
right
he
murmured
we
must
pray
that
god
will
direct
our
friends
to
this
island
otherwise
we
may
not
be
found
for
a
year
as
unhappily
the
fishermen
who
once
came
here
now
avoid
the
place
they
have
been
frightened
by
the
contents
of
the
hollow
behind
the
cliff
i
am
glad
you
have
solved
the
difficulty
unaided
miss
deane
i
have
striven
at
times
to
be
coarse
even
brutal
towards
you
but
my
heart
flinched
from
the
task
of
telling
you
the
possible
period
of
your
imprisonment
then
iris
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
wept
bitterly
and
jenks
blind
to
the
true
cause
of
her
emotion
picked
up
a
rifle
to
which
in
spare
moments
he
had
affixed
a
curious
device
and
walked
slowly
across
prospect
park
towards
the
road
leading
to
the
valley
of
death
the
girl
watched
him
disappear
among
the
trees
through
her
tears
shone
a
sorrowful
little
smile
he
thinks
only
of
me
never
of
himself
she
communed
if
it
pleases
providence
to
spare
us
from
these
savages
what
does
it
matter
to
me
how
long
we
remain
here
i
have
never
been
so
happy
before
in
my
life
i
fear
i
never
will
be
again
if
it
were
not
for
my
father
terrible
anxiety
i
would
not
have
a
care
in
the
world
i
only
wish
to
get
away
so
that
one
brave
soul
at
least
may
be
rid
of
needless
tortures
all
his
worry
is
on
my
account
none
on
his
own
that
was
what
tearful
miss
iris
thought
or
tried
to
persuade
herself
to
think
perhaps
her
cogitations
would
not
bear
strict
analysis
perhaps
she
harbored
a
sweet
hope
that
the
future
might
yet
contain
bright
hours
for
herself
and
the
man
who
was
so
devoted
to
her
she
refused
to
believe
that
robert
anstruther
strong
of
arm
and
clear
of
brain
a
knight
of
the
round
table
in
all
that
was
noble
and
chivalric
would
permit
his
name
to
bear
an
unwarrantable
stigma
when
and
she
blushed
like
a
june
rose
he
came
to
tell
her
that
which
he
had
written
the
sailor
returned
hastily
with
the
manner
of
one
hurrying
to
perform
a
neglected
task
without
any
explanation
to
iris
he
climbed
several
times
to
the
ledge
carrying
of
grass
roots
which
he
planted
in
full
view
then
he
entered
the
cave
and
although
he
was
furnished
only
with
the
dim
light
that
penetrated
through
the
distant
exit
she
heard
him
hewing
manfully
at
the
rock
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
last
he
emerged
grimy
with
dust
and
perspiration
just
in
time
to
pay
a
last
visit
to
summit
rock
before
the
sun
sank
to
rest
he
asked
the
girl
to
delay
somewhat
the
preparations
for
their
evening
meal
as
he
wished
to
take
a
bath
so
it
was
quite
dark
when
they
sat
down
to
eat
iris
had
long
recovered
her
usual
state
of
high
spirits
why
were
you
burrowing
in
the
cavern
again
she
inquired
are
you
in
a
hurry
to
get
rich
i
was
following
an
not
a
lode
he
replied
i
am
occasionally
troubled
with
after
wit
and
this
is
an
instance
do
you
remember
how
the
flame
of
the
lamp
flickered
whilst
we
were
opening
up
our
mine
yes
i
was
so
absorbed
in
contemplating
our
prospective
wealth
that
i
failed
to
pay
heed
to
the
true
significance
of
that
incident
it
meant
the
existence
of
an
upward
current
of
air
now
where
the
current
goes
there
must
be
a
passage
and
whilst
i
was
busy
this
afternoon
among
the
trees
over
there
he
pointed
towards
the
valley
of
death
it
came
to
me
like
an
inspiration
that
possibly
a
few
hours
hewing
and
delving
might
open
a
shaft
to
the
ledge
i
have
been
well
rewarded
for
the
effort
the
stuff
in
the
vault
is
so
eaten
away
by
water
that
it
is
no
more
solid
than
hard
mud
for
the
most
part
already
i
have
scooped
out
a
chimney
twelve
feet
high
what
good
can
that
be
at
present
we
have
only
a
front
door
up
the
face
of
the
rock
when
my
work
is
completed
before
tomorrow
night
i
hope
we
shall
have
a
back
door
also
of
course
i
may
encounter
unforeseen
obstacles
as
i
advance
a
twist
in
the
fault
would
be
nearly
fatal
but
i
am
praying
that
it
may
continue
straight
to
the
ledge
i
still
do
see
the
great
advantage
to
us
the
advantages
are
many
believe
me
the
more
points
of
attack
presented
by
the
enemy
the
more
effective
will
be
our
resistance
i
doubt
if
they
would
ever
be
able
to
rush
the
cave
were
we
to
hold
it
whereas
i
can
go
up
and
down
our
back
staircase
whenever
i
choose
if
you
do
mind
being
left
in
the
dark
i
will
resume
work
now
by
the
light
of
your
lamp
but
iris
protested
against
this
arrangement
she
felt
lonely
the
long
hours
of
silence
had
been
distasteful
to
her
she
wanted
to
talk
i
agree
said
jenks
provided
you
do
not
pin
me
down
to
something
i
told
you
a
month
ago
i
promise
you
can
tell
me
as
much
or
as
little
as
you
think
fit
the
subject
for
discussion
is
your
he
could
not
see
the
tender
light
in
her
eyes
but
the
quiet
sympathy
of
her
voice
restrained
the
protest
prompt
on
his
lips
yet
he
blurted
out
after
a
slight
pause
that
is
a
very
unsavory
subject
is
it
i
do
not
think
so
i
am
a
friend
jenks
not
an
old
one
i
admit
but
during
the
past
six
weeks
we
have
bridged
an
ordinary
acquaintanceship
of
as
many
years
can
you
not
trust
me
trust
her
he
laughed
softly
then
choosing
his
words
with
great
deliberation
he
answered
yes
i
can
trust
you
i
intended
to
tell
you
the
story
some
day
why
not
tonight
unseen
in
the
darkness
iris
hand
sought
and
clasped
the
gold
locket
suspended
from
her
neck
she
already
knew
some
portion
of
the
story
he
would
tell
the
remainder
was
of
minor
importance
it
is
odd
he
continued
that
you
should
have
alluded
to
six
years
a
moment
ago
it
is
exactly
six
years
almost
to
a
day
since
the
trouble
began
with
lord
ventnor
the
name
slipped
out
involuntarily
yes
i
was
then
a
staff
corps
subaltern
and
my
proficiency
in
native
languages
attracted
the
attention
of
a
friend
in
simla
who
advised
me
to
apply
for
an
appointment
on
the
political
side
of
the
government
of
india
i
did
so
he
supported
the
application
and
i
was
assured
of
the
next
vacancy
in
a
native
state
provided
that
i
got
married
he
drawled
out
the
concluding
words
with
exasperating
slowness
iris
astounded
by
the
stipulation
dropped
her
locket
and
leaned
forward
into
the
red
light
of
the
log
fire
the
sailor
quick
eye
caught
the
glitter
of
the
ornament
by
the
way
he
interrupted
what
is
that
thing
shining
on
your
breast
she
instantly
clasped
the
trinket
again
it
is
my
sole
remaining
adornment
she
said
a
present
from
my
father
on
my
tenth
birthday
pray
go
on
i
was
not
a
marrying
man
miss
deane
and
the
requisite
qualification
nearly
staggered
me
but
i
looked
around
the
station
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
commissioner
niece
would
make
a
suitable
wife
i
regarded
her
so
to
speak
and
they
filled
the
bill
she
was
smart
lively
understood
the
art
of
entertaining
was
in
sports
and
had
excellent
teeth
indeed
if
a
man
selected
a
wife
as
he
does
a
horse
she
do
be
horrid
was
she
really
pretty
i
believe
so
people
said
she
was
but
what
did
think
at
the
time
my
opinion
was
biased
i
have
seen
her
since
and
she
wears
badly
she
is
married
now
and
after
thirty
grew
very
fat
artful
jenks
iris
settled
herself
comfortably
to
listen
i
have
jumped
that
fence
with
a
lot
in
hand
he
thought
we
became
engaged
he
said
aloud
she
threw
herself
at
him
communed
iris
her
name
was
elizabeth
elizabeth
morris
the
young
lieutenant
of
those
days
called
her
bessie
but
no
matter
well
you
did
marry
her
anyhow
commented
iris
a
trifle
sharply
and
now
the
sailor
was
on
level
ground
again
thank
heaven
no
he
said
earnestly
we
had
barely
become
engaged
when
she
went
with
her
uncle
to
simla
for
the
hot
weather
there
she
met
lord
ventnor
who
was
on
the
viceroy
staff
and
if
you
mind
we
will
skip
a
portion
of
the
narrative
i
discovered
then
why
men
in
india
usually
go
to
england
for
their
wives
whilst
in
simla
on
ten
days
leave
i
had
a
foolish
row
with
lord
ventnor
in
the
united
service
club
hammered
him
in
fact
in
defence
of
a
worthless
woman
and
was
only
saved
from
a
severe
reprimand
because
i
had
been
badly
treated
nevertheless
my
hopes
of
a
political
appointment
vanished
and
i
returned
to
my
regiment
to
learn
after
due
reflection
what
a
very
lucky
person
i
was
concerning
miss
morris
you
mean
exactly
and
now
exit
elizabeth
not
being
cut
out
for
matrimonial
enterprise
i
tried
to
become
a
good
officer
a
year
ago
when
government
asked
for
volunteers
to
form
chinese
regiments
i
sent
in
my
name
and
was
accepted
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
serve
under
an
old
friend
colonel
costobell
but
some
malign
star
sent
lord
ventnor
to
the
far
east
this
time
in
an
important
civil
capacity
i
met
him
occasionally
and
we
found
we
did
not
like
each
other
any
better
my
horse
beat
his
for
the
pagoda
hurdle
handicap
poor
old
sultan
i
wonder
where
he
is
now
was
your
horse
called
yes
i
bought
him
in
meerut
trained
him
myself
and
ferried
him
all
the
way
to
china
i
loved
him
next
to
the
british
army
this
was
quite
satisfactory
there
was
genuine
feeling
in
his
voice
now
iris
became
even
more
interested
colonel
costobell
fell
ill
and
the
command
of
the
regiment
devolved
upon
me
our
only
major
being
absent
in
the
interior
the
wife
unhappily
chose
that
moment
to
flirt
as
people
say
with
lord
ventnor
not
having
learnt
the
advisability
of
minding
my
own
business
i
remonstrated
with
her
thus
making
her
my
deadly
enemy
lord
ventnor
contrived
an
official
mission
to
a
neighboring
town
and
detailed
me
for
the
military
charge
i
sent
a
junior
officer
then
costobell
and
he
deliberately
concocted
a
plot
to
ruin
me
he
for
the
sake
of
his
old
animosity
you
remember
that
i
had
also
crossed
his
path
in
egypt
she
because
she
feared
i
would
speak
to
her
husband
on
pretence
of
seeking
my
advice
she
inveigled
me
at
night
into
a
deserted
corner
of
the
club
grounds
at
hong
kong
lord
ventnor
appeared
and
as
the
upshot
of
their
vile
statements
which
created
an
immediate
uproar
i
well
miss
deane
i
nearly
killed
him
iris
vividly
recalled
the
anguish
he
betrayed
when
this
topic
was
inadvertently
broached
one
day
early
in
their
acquaintance
now
he
was
reciting
his
painful
history
with
the
air
of
a
man
far
more
concerned
to
be
scrupulously
accurate
than
aroused
in
his
deepest
passions
by
the
memory
of
past
wrongs
what
had
happened
in
the
interim
to
blunt
these
bygone
sufferings
iris
clasped
her
locket
she
thought
she
knew
the
remainder
may
be
told
in
a
sentence
he
said
of
what
avail
were
my
frenzied
statements
against
the
definite
proofs
adduced
by
lord
ventnor
and
his
unfortunate
ally
even
her
husband
believed
her
and
became
my
bitter
foe
poor
woman
i
have
it
in
my
heart
to
pity
her
well
that
is
all
i
am
here
can
a
man
be
ruined
so
easily
murmured
the
girl
her
exquisite
tact
leading
her
to
avoid
any
direct
expression
of
sympathy
it
seems
so
but
i
have
had
my
reward
if
ever
i
meet
costobell
again
i
will
thank
her
for
a
great
service
iris
suddenly
became
confused
her
brow
and
neck
tingled
with
a
quick
access
of
color
why
do
you
say
that
she
asked
and
jenks
who
was
rising
either
did
not
hear
or
pretended
not
to
hear
the
tremor
in
her
tone
because
you
once
told
me
you
would
never
marry
lord
ventnor
and
after
what
i
have
told
you
now
i
am
quite
sure
you
will
not
ah
then
you
trust
me
she
almost
whispered
he
forced
back
the
words
trembling
for
utterance
he
even
strove
weakly
to
assume
an
air
of
badinage
see
how
you
have
tempted
me
from
work
miss
deane
he
cried
we
have
gossiped
here
until
the
fire
grew
tired
of
our
company
to
bed
please
at
once
iris
caught
him
by
the
arm
i
will
pray
tonight
and
every
night
she
said
solemnly
that
your
good
name
may
be
cleared
in
the
eyes
of
all
men
as
it
is
in
mine
and
i
am
sure
my
prayer
will
be
answered
she
passed
into
her
chamber
but
her
angelic
influence
remained
in
his
very
soul
the
man
thanked
god
for
the
tribulation
which
brought
this
woman
into
his
life
he
had
traversed
the
wilderness
to
find
an
oasis
of
rare
beauty
what
might
lie
beyond
he
neither
knew
nor
cared
through
the
remainder
of
his
existence
be
it
a
day
or
many
a
year
he
would
be
glorified
by
the
knowledge
that
in
one
incomparable
heart
he
reigned
supreme
unchallenged
if
only
for
the
hour
fatigue
anxiety
bitter
recollection
and
present
danger
were
overwhelmed
and
forgotten
in
the
nearness
the
intangible
presence
of
iris
he
looked
up
to
the
starry
vault
and
yielding
to
the
spell
he
too
prayed
it
was
a
beautiful
night
after
a
baking
hot
day
the
rocks
were
radiating
their
heat
but
the
pleasant
breeze
that
generally
set
in
at
sunset
tempered
the
atmosphere
and
made
sleep
refreshing
jenks
could
not
settle
down
to
rest
for
a
little
while
after
iris
left
him
she
did
not
bring
forth
her
lamp
and
unwilling
to
disturb
her
he
picked
up
a
resinous
branch
lit
it
in
the
dying
fire
and
went
into
the
cave
he
wanted
to
survey
the
work
already
done
and
to
determine
whether
it
would
be
better
to
resume
operations
in
the
morning
from
inside
the
excavation
or
from
the
ledge
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
constructing
a
vertical
upward
shaft
and
the
danger
of
a
sudden
fall
of
heavy
material
he
decided
in
favor
of
the
latter
course
although
it
entailed
lifting
all
the
refuse
out
of
the
hole
to
save
time
therefore
he
carried
his
mining
tools
into
the
open
placed
in
position
the
de
long
since
constructed
for
the
defence
of
the
entrance
and
poured
water
over
the
remains
of
the
fire
this
was
his
final
care
each
night
before
stretching
his
weary
limbs
on
his
couch
of
branches
it
caused
delay
in
the
morning
but
he
neglected
no
precaution
and
there
was
a
possible
chance
of
the
dyaks
failing
to
discover
the
eagle
nest
if
they
were
persuaded
by
other
indications
that
the
island
was
deserted
he
entered
the
hut
and
was
in
the
act
of
pulling
off
his
boots
when
a
distant
shot
rang
sharply
through
the
air
it
was
magnified
tenfold
by
the
intense
silence
for
a
few
seconds
that
seemed
to
be
minutes
he
listened
cherishing
the
quick
thought
that
perhaps
a
turtle
wandering
far
beyond
accustomed
limits
had
disturbed
one
of
the
communications
on
the
sands
a
sputtering
volley
which
his
trained
ear
recognized
as
the
firing
of
sounded
the
of
his
last
hope
the
dyaks
had
landed
coming
silently
and
mysteriously
in
the
dead
of
night
they
were
themselves
the
victims
of
a
stratagem
they
designed
to
employ
instead
of
taking
the
occupants
of
rainbow
island
unawares
they
were
startled
at
being
greeted
by
a
shot
the
moment
they
landed
the
alarmed
savages
at
once
retaliated
by
firing
their
antiquated
weapons
at
the
trees
thus
giving
warning
enough
to
wake
the
seven
sleepers
iris
fully
dressed
was
out
in
a
moment
they
have
come
she
whispered
yes
was
the
cheery
answer
for
jenks
face
to
face
with
danger
was
a
very
different
man
to
jenks
wrestling
with
the
insidious
attacks
of
cupid
up
the
ladder
be
lively
they
will
not
be
here
for
half
an
hour
if
they
kick
up
such
a
row
at
the
first
difficulty
still
we
will
take
no
risks
cast
down
those
spare
lines
when
you
reach
the
top
and
haul
away
when
i
say
you
will
find
everything
to
hand
up
there
he
held
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
to
steady
it
for
the
girl
climb
soon
her
voice
fell
like
a
message
from
a
star
all
right
please
join
me
soon
the
ropes
dropped
along
the
face
of
the
rock
clothes
pick
hatchet
hammer
crowbars
and
other
useful
odds
and
ends
were
swung
away
into
the
darkness
for
the
moon
as
yet
did
not
illumine
the
crag
the
sailor
darted
into
belle
vue
castle
and
kicked
their
leafy
beds
about
the
floor
then
he
slung
all
the
rifles
now
five
in
number
over
his
shoulders
and
mounted
the
which
with
the
spare
cords
he
drew
up
and
coiled
with
careful
method
by
the
way
he
suddenly
asked
have
you
your
yes
and
your
bible
yes
it
rests
beneath
my
head
every
night
i
even
brought
our
tennyson
ah
he
growled
fiercely
this
is
where
the
reality
differs
from
the
romance
our
troubles
are
only
beginning
now
they
will
end
the
sooner
for
my
part
i
have
utter
faith
in
you
if
it
be
god
will
we
will
escape
and
no
man
is
more
worthy
than
you
to
be
his
agent
chapter
xi
the
fight
the
sailor
knew
so
accurately
the
position
of
his
reliable
sentinels
that
he
could
follow
each
phase
of
the
imaginary
conflict
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
the
first
outbreak
of
desultory
firing
died
away
amidst
a
chorus
of
protest
from
every
feathered
inhabitant
of
the
isle
so
jenks
assumed
that
the
dyaks
had
gathered
again
on
the
beach
after
riddling
the
scarecrows
with
bullets
or
slashing
them
with
their
heavy
parangs
malay
swords
with
which
experts
can
fell
a
stout
sapling
at
a
single
blow
a
hasty
council
was
probably
held
and
notwithstanding
their
fear
of
the
silent
company
in
the
hollow
an
advance
was
ultimately
made
along
the
beach
within
a
few
yards
they
encountered
the
invisible
cord
of
the
third
there
was
a
report
and
another
fierce
outbreak
of
musketry
this
was
enough
not
a
man
would
move
a
step
nearer
that
abode
of
the
dead
the
next
commotion
arose
on
the
ridge
near
the
north
cape
at
this
rate
of
progress
said
jenks
to
the
girl
they
will
not
reach
our
house
until
daylight
i
almost
wish
they
were
here
was
the
quiet
reply
i
find
this
waiting
and
listening
to
be
trying
to
the
nerves
they
were
lying
on
a
number
of
ragged
garments
hastily
spread
on
the
ledge
and
peering
intently
into
the
moonlit
area
of
prospect
park
the
great
rock
itself
was
shrouded
in
somber
shadows
even
if
they
stood
up
none
could
see
them
from
the
ground
so
dense
was
the
darkness
enveloping
them
he
turned
slightly
and
took
her
hand
it
was
cool
and
moist
it
no
more
trembled
than
his
own
the
dyaks
are
far
more
scared
than
you
he
murmured
with
a
laugh
cruel
and
courageous
as
they
are
they
dare
not
face
a
spook
then
what
a
pity
it
is
we
can
not
conjure
up
a
ghost
for
their
benefit
all
the
spirits
i
have
ever
read
about
were
ridiculous
why
can
not
one
be
useful
occasionally
the
question
set
him
thinking
unknown
to
the
girl
the
materials
for
a
dramatic
apparition
were
hidden
amidst
the
bushes
near
the
well
he
cudgeled
his
brains
to
remember
the
stage
effects
of
juvenile
days
but
these
needed
limelight
blue
flares
mirrors
phosphorus
the
absurdity
of
hoping
to
devise
any
such
accessories
whilst
perched
on
a
ledge
in
a
remote
island
a
larger
reef
of
the
thousands
in
the
china
sea
tickled
him
what
is
it
asked
iris
he
repeated
his
list
of
missing
stage
properties
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
and
people
in
the
very
crux
and
maelstrom
of
existence
usually
discuss
trivial
things
i
do
know
anything
about
phosphorus
said
the
girl
but
you
can
obtain
queer
results
from
sulphur
and
there
is
an
old
box
of
norwegian
matches
resting
at
this
moment
on
the
shelf
in
my
room
do
you
remember
they
were
in
your
pocket
and
you
were
going
to
throw
them
away
why
what
are
you
doing
for
jenks
had
cast
the
loose
and
was
evidently
about
to
descend
have
no
fear
he
said
i
will
not
be
away
five
minutes
if
you
are
going
down
i
must
come
with
you
i
will
not
be
left
here
alone
please
do
not
stop
me
he
whispered
earnestly
you
must
not
come
i
will
take
no
risk
whatever
if
you
remain
here
you
can
warn
me
instantly
with
both
of
us
on
the
ground
we
will
incur
real
danger
i
want
you
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
towards
turtle
beach
in
case
the
dyaks
come
that
way
those
who
are
crossing
the
island
will
not
reach
us
for
a
long
time
she
yielded
though
unwillingly
she
was
tremulous
with
anxiety
on
his
account
he
vanished
without
another
word
she
next
saw
him
in
the
moonlight
near
the
well
he
was
rustling
among
the
shrubs
and
he
returned
to
the
rock
with
something
white
in
his
arms
which
he
seemingly
deposited
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
he
went
back
to
the
well
and
carried
another
similar
burthen
then
he
ran
towards
the
house
the
doorway
was
not
visible
from
the
ledge
and
she
passed
a
few
horrible
moments
until
a
low
hiss
beneath
caught
her
ear
she
could
tell
by
the
creak
of
the
that
he
was
ascending
at
last
he
reached
her
side
and
she
murmured
with
a
gasping
sob
do
go
away
again
i
can
not
stand
it
he
thought
it
best
to
soothe
her
agitation
by
arousing
interest
still
hauling
in
the
ladder
with
one
hand
he
held
out
the
other
on
which
luminous
wisps
were
writhing
like
ghosts
you
are
responsible
he
said
you
gave
me
an
excellent
idea
and
i
was
obliged
to
carry
it
out
what
have
you
done
arranged
a
fearsome
bogey
in
the
cave
but
how
it
was
not
exactly
a
pleasant
operation
but
the
only
laws
of
necessity
are
those
which
must
be
broken
she
understood
that
he
did
not
wish
her
to
question
him
further
perhaps
curiosity
now
that
he
was
safe
might
have
vanquished
her
terror
and
led
to
another
demand
for
enlightenment
but
at
that
instant
the
sound
of
an
angry
voice
and
the
crunching
of
coral
away
to
the
left
drove
all
else
from
her
mind
they
are
coming
by
way
of
the
beach
after
all
whispered
jenks
he
was
mistaken
in
a
sense
another
outburst
of
intermittent
firing
among
the
trees
on
the
north
of
the
ridge
showed
that
some
at
least
of
the
dyaks
were
advancing
by
their
former
route
the
appearance
of
the
dyak
chief
on
the
flat
belt
of
shingle
with
his
right
arm
slung
across
his
breast
accompanied
by
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
followers
showed
that
a
few
hardy
spirits
had
dared
to
pass
the
valley
of
death
with
all
its
nameless
terrors
they
advanced
cautiously
enough
as
though
dreading
a
surprise
the
chief
carried
a
bright
parang
in
his
left
hand
the
others
were
armed
with
guns
their
swords
being
thrust
through
belts
creeping
forward
on
though
their
distant
companions
were
making
a
tremendous
row
they
looked
a
murderous
gang
as
they
peered
across
the
open
space
now
brilliantly
illuminated
by
the
moon
jenks
had
a
sudden
intuition
that
the
right
thing
to
do
now
was
to
shoot
the
whole
party
he
dismissed
the
thought
at
once
all
his
preparations
were
governed
by
the
hope
that
the
pirates
might
abandon
their
quest
after
hours
of
fruitless
search
it
would
be
most
unwise
he
told
himself
to
precipitate
hostilities
far
better
avoid
a
conflict
altogether
if
that
were
possible
than
risk
the
immediate
discovery
of
his
inaccessible
retreat
in
other
words
he
made
a
grave
mistake
which
shows
how
a
man
may
err
when
by
the
danger
of
the
woman
he
loves
the
bold
course
was
the
right
one
by
killing
the
dyak
leader
he
would
have
deprived
the
enemy
of
the
dominating
influence
in
this
campaign
of
revenge
when
the
main
body
already
much
perturbed
by
the
unseen
and
intangible
agencies
which
opened
fire
at
them
in
the
wood
arrived
in
prospect
park
to
find
only
the
dead
bodies
of
their
chief
and
his
small
force
their
consternation
could
be
turned
into
mad
panic
by
a
vigorous
bombardment
from
the
rock
probably
in
less
than
an
hour
after
their
landing
the
whole
tribe
would
have
rushed
to
the
boats
cursing
the
folly
which
led
them
to
this
island
but
it
serves
no
good
purpose
to
say
what
might
have
been
as
it
was
the
dyaks
silent
now
and
moving
with
the
utmost
caution
passed
the
well
and
were
about
to
approach
the
cave
when
one
of
them
saw
the
house
instantly
they
changed
their
tactics
retreating
hastily
to
the
shade
of
the
opposite
cliff
they
seemed
to
await
the
coming
of
reinforcements
the
sailor
fancied
that
a
messenger
was
dispatched
by
way
of
the
north
sands
to
hurry
up
the
laggards
because
the
distant
firing
slackened
and
five
minutes
later
a
fierce
outbreak
of
yells
among
the
trees
to
the
right
heralded
a
combined
rush
on
the
belle
vue
castle
the
noise
made
by
the
savages
was
so
great
the
screams
of
bewildered
birds
circling
overhead
so
incessant
that
jenks
was
compelled
to
speak
quite
loudly
when
he
said
to
iris
they
must
think
we
sleep
soundly
not
to
be
disturbed
by
the
volleys
they
have
fired
already
she
would
have
answered
but
he
placed
a
restraining
hand
on
her
shoulder
for
the
dyaks
quickly
discovering
that
the
hut
was
empty
ran
towards
the
cave
and
thus
came
in
full
view
as
well
as
jenks
could
judge
the
foremost
trio
of
the
yelping
horde
were
impaled
on
the
bayonets
of
the
de
learning
too
late
its
formidable
nature
the
wounded
men
shrieked
in
agony
but
their
cries
were
drowned
in
a
torrent
of
amazed
shouts
from
their
companions
forthwith
there
was
a
stampede
towards
the
well
the
cliff
the
beaches
anywhere
to
get
away
from
that
awesome
cavern
where
ghosts
dwelt
and
men
fell
maimed
at
the
very
threshold
the
sailor
leaning
as
far
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
as
the
girl
expostulations
would
permit
heard
a
couple
of
men
groaning
beneath
whilst
a
third
limped
away
with
frantic
and
painful
haste
what
is
it
whispered
iris
eager
herself
to
witness
the
tumult
what
has
happened
they
have
been
routed
by
a
box
of
matches
and
a
few
dried
bones
he
answered
there
was
no
time
for
further
speech
he
was
absorbed
in
estimating
the
probable
number
of
the
dyaks
thus
far
he
had
seen
about
fifty
moreover
he
did
not
wish
to
acquaint
iris
with
the
actual
details
of
the
artifice
that
had
been
so
potent
her
allusion
to
the
box
of
tändstickors
gave
him
the
notion
of
utilizing
as
an
active
ally
the
bleached
remains
of
the
poor
fellow
who
had
long
ago
fallen
a
victim
to
this
identical
mob
of
or
their
associates
he
gathered
the
principal
bones
from
their
near
the
well
rubbed
them
with
the
ends
of
the
matches
after
damping
the
sulphur
again
and
arranged
them
with
ghastly
effect
on
the
pile
of
rubbish
at
the
further
end
of
the
cave
creeping
under
the
de
for
the
purpose
though
not
so
vivid
as
he
wished
the
headless
skeleton
in
the
intense
darkness
of
the
interior
was
appalling
enough
in
all
conscience
fortunately
the
fumes
of
the
sulphur
fed
on
the
bony
substance
they
endured
a
sufficient
time
to
scare
every
dyak
who
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
monstrous
object
crouching
in
luminous
horror
within
the
dismal
cavern
not
even
the
stirring
exhortations
of
the
chief
whose
voice
was
raised
in
furious
speech
could
induce
his
adherents
to
again
approach
that
affrighting
spot
at
last
the
daring
scoundrel
himself
still
wielding
his
naked
sword
strode
right
up
to
the
very
doorway
stricken
with
sudden
stupor
he
gazed
at
the
fitful
gleams
within
he
prodded
the
de
with
the
parang
here
was
something
definite
and
solid
then
he
dragged
one
of
the
wounded
men
out
into
the
moonlight
again
jenks
experienced
an
itching
desire
to
send
a
bullet
through
the
dyak
head
again
he
resisted
the
impulse
and
so
passed
that
which
is
vouchsafed
by
fate
to
few
men
a
second
opportunity
another
vehement
harangue
by
the
chief
goaded
some
venturesome
spirits
into
carrying
their
wounded
comrade
out
of
sight
presumably
to
the
hut
inspired
by
their
leader
fearless
example
they
even
removed
the
third
injured
dyak
from
the
vicinity
of
the
cave
but
the
celerity
of
their
retreat
caused
the
wretch
to
bawl
in
agony
their
next
undertaking
was
no
sooner
appreciated
by
the
sailor
than
he
hurriedly
caused
iris
to
shelter
herself
beneath
the
tarpaulin
whilst
he
cowered
close
to
the
floor
of
the
ledge
looking
only
through
the
screen
of
tall
grasses
they
kindled
a
fire
near
the
well
soon
its
ruddy
glare
lit
up
the
dark
rock
with
fantastic
flickerings
and
drew
scintillations
from
the
weapons
and
ornaments
of
the
hideously
picturesque
horde
gathered
in
its
vicinity
they
spoke
a
language
of
hard
vowels
and
nasal
resonance
and
ate
what
he
judged
to
be
dry
fish
millets
and
strips
of
tough
preserved
meat
which
they
cooked
on
small
iron
skewers
stuck
among
the
glowing
embers
his
heart
sank
as
he
counted
all
told
assembled
within
forty
yards
of
the
ledge
probably
several
others
were
guarding
the
boats
or
prowling
about
the
island
indeed
events
proved
that
more
than
eighty
men
had
come
ashore
in
three
large
sampans
roomy
and
fleet
craft
well
fitted
for
piratical
excursions
up
river
estuaries
or
along
a
coast
they
were
mostly
rascals
wearing
malay
hats
loose
jackets
reaching
to
the
knee
and
sandals
one
man
differed
essentially
from
the
others
he
was
habited
in
the
conventional
attire
of
an
indian
mahommedan
and
his
skin
was
brown
whilst
the
swarthy
dyaks
were
yellow
beneath
the
dirt
jenks
thought
from
the
manner
in
which
his
turban
was
tied
that
he
must
be
a
punjabi
mussulman
very
likely
an
escaped
convict
from
the
andamans
the
most
careful
scrutiny
did
not
reveal
any
arms
of
precision
they
all
carried
either
antiquated
flintlocks
or
guns
sufficiently
modern
to
be
fitted
with
nipples
for
percussion
caps
each
dyak
of
course
sported
a
parang
and
kriss
a
few
bore
spears
and
about
a
dozen
shouldered
a
long
straight
piece
of
bamboo
the
nature
of
this
implement
the
sailor
could
not
determine
at
the
moment
when
the
knowledge
did
come
it
came
so
rapidly
that
he
was
saved
from
many
earlier
hours
of
abiding
dread
for
one
of
those
weapons
was
fraught
with
more
quiet
deadliness
than
a
gatling
gun
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
fire
an
animated
discussion
took
place
though
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
chief
was
his
exercised
a
democratic
right
of
free
speech
and
outspoken
opinion
flashing
eyes
and
expressive
hands
were
turned
towards
cave
and
hut
once
when
the
debate
grew
warm
the
chief
snatched
up
a
burning
branch
and
held
it
over
the
blackened
embers
of
the
fire
extinguished
by
jenks
he
seemed
to
draw
some
definite
conclusion
from
an
examination
of
the
charcoal
and
the
argument
thenceforth
proceeded
with
less
emphasis
whatever
it
was
that
he
said
evidently
carried
conviction
iris
nestling
close
to
the
sailor
whispered
do
you
know
what
he
has
found
out
i
can
only
guess
that
he
can
tell
by
the
appearance
of
the
burnt
wood
how
long
it
is
since
it
was
extinguished
clearly
they
agree
with
him
then
they
know
we
are
still
here
either
here
or
gone
within
a
few
hours
in
any
case
they
will
make
a
thorough
search
of
the
island
at
daybreak
will
it
be
dawn
soon
yes
are
you
tired
a
little
cramped
that
is
all
do
think
i
am
foolish
can
you
manage
to
sleep
sleep
with
those
men
so
near
yes
we
do
not
know
how
long
they
will
remain
we
must
keep
up
our
strength
sleep
next
to
food
and
drink
is
a
prime
necessity
if
it
will
please
you
i
will
try
she
said
with
such
sweet
readiness
to
obey
his
slightest
wish
that
the
wonder
is
he
did
not
kiss
her
then
and
there
by
previous
instruction
she
knew
exactly
what
to
do
she
crept
quietly
back
until
well
ensconced
in
the
niche
widened
and
hollowed
for
her
accommodation
there
so
secluded
was
she
from
the
outer
world
of
horror
and
peril
that
the
coarse
voices
beneath
only
reached
her
in
a
murmur
pulling
one
end
of
the
tarpaulin
over
her
she
stretched
her
weary
limbs
on
a
litter
of
twigs
and
leaves
commended
herself
and
the
man
she
loved
to
god
keeping
and
wonderful
though
it
may
seem
was
soon
slumbering
peacefully
the
statement
may
sound
passing
strange
to
civilized
ears
accustomed
only
to
the
routine
of
daily
life
and
not
inured
to
danger
and
wild
surroundings
but
the
soldier
who
has
snatched
a
hasty
doze
in
the
trenches
the
sailor
who
has
heard
a
fierce
gale
buffeting
the
walls
of
his
frail
ark
can
appreciate
the
reason
why
iris
weary
and
surfeited
with
excitement
would
have
slept
were
she
certain
that
the
next
sunrise
would
mark
her
last
hour
on
earth
jenks
too
composed
himself
for
a
brief
rest
he
felt
assured
that
there
was
not
the
remotest
chance
of
their
lofty
perch
being
found
out
before
daybreak
and
the
first
faint
streaks
of
dawn
would
awaken
him
these
two
remote
abandoned
hopelessly
environed
by
a
savage
enemy
closed
their
eyes
contentedly
and
awaited
that
which
the
coming
day
should
bring
forth
when
the
morning
breeze
swept
over
the
ocean
and
the
stars
were
beginning
to
pale
before
the
pink
glory
flung
broadcast
through
the
sky
by
the
yet
invisible
sun
the
sailor
was
aroused
by
the
quiet
fluttering
of
a
bird
about
to
settle
on
the
rock
but
startled
by
the
sight
of
him
his
faculties
were
at
once
on
the
alert
though
he
little
realized
the
danger
betokened
by
the
bird
rapid
dart
into
the
void
turning
first
to
peer
at
iris
he
satisfied
himself
that
she
was
still
asleep
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
in
a
smile
she
might
be
dreaming
of
summer
and
england
he
noiselessly
wormed
his
way
to
the
verge
of
the
rock
and
looked
down
through
the
the
dyaks
were
already
stirring
some
were
replenishing
the
fire
others
were
drawing
water
cooking
eating
smoking
long
pipes
with
absurdly
small
bowls
or
oiling
their
limbs
and
weapons
with
impartial
energy
the
chief
yet
lay
stretched
on
the
sand
but
when
the
first
beams
of
the
sun
gilded
the
waters
a
man
stooped
over
the
prostrate
form
and
said
something
that
caused
the
sleeper
to
rise
stiffly
supporting
himself
on
his
uninjured
arm
they
at
once
went
off
together
towards
europa
point
they
have
found
the
boat
thought
jenks
well
they
are
welcome
to
all
the
information
it
affords
the
pair
soon
returned
another
dyak
advanced
to
exhibit
one
of
attachments
the
savages
had
a
sense
of
humor
several
laughed
heartily
when
the
cause
of
their
overnight
alarms
was
revealed
the
chief
alone
preserved
a
gloomy
and
saturnine
expression
he
gave
some
order
at
which
they
all
hung
back
sheepishly
cursing
them
in
choice
malay
the
chief
seized
a
thick
faggot
and
strode
in
the
direction
of
the
cave
goaded
into
activity
by
his
truculent
demeanor
some
followed
him
and
jenks
unable
to
see
but
listening
anxiously
knew
that
they
were
tearing
the
de
from
its
supports
nevertheless
none
of
the
working
party
entered
the
excavation
they
feared
the
parched
bones
that
shone
by
night
poor
murmured
the
sailor
if
his
spirit
still
lingers
near
the
scene
of
his
murder
he
will
thank
me
for
dragging
him
into
the
fray
he
fought
them
living
and
he
can
scare
them
dead
as
he
had
not
been
able
to
complete
the
communicating
shaft
it
was
not
now
of
vital
importance
should
the
dyaks
penetrate
to
the
interior
yet
he
thanked
the
good
luck
that
had
showered
such
a
heap
of
rubbish
over
the
spot
containing
his
chief
stores
and
covering
the
vein
of
gold
wild
as
these
fellows
were
they
well
knew
the
value
of
the
precious
metal
and
if
by
chance
they
lighted
upon
such
a
lode
they
might
not
quit
the
island
for
weeks
at
last
on
a
command
from
the
chief
the
dyaks
scattered
in
various
directions
some
turned
towards
europa
point
but
the
majority
went
to
the
east
along
turtle
beach
or
by
way
of
the
lagoon
prospect
park
was
deserted
they
were
scouring
both
sections
of
the
island
in
full
force
the
quiet
watcher
on
the
ledge
took
no
needless
risks
though
it
was
impossible
to
believe
any
stratagem
had
been
planned
for
his
special
benefit
an
accident
might
betray
him
with
the
utmost
circumspection
he
rose
on
all
fours
and
with
comprehensive
glance
examined
trees
plateau
and
both
strips
of
beach
for
signs
of
a
lurking
foe
he
need
have
no
fear
of
all
places
in
the
island
the
dyaks
least
imagined
that
their
quarry
had
lain
all
night
within
earshot
of
their
encampment
at
this
hour
when
the
day
had
finally
conquered
the
night
and
the
placid
sea
offered
a
turquoise
path
to
the
infinite
the
scene
was
restful
gently
bewitching
he
knew
that
away
there
to
the
north
and
steamers
messageries
maritimes
and
north
german
lloyd
liners
were
steadily
churning
the
blue
depths
to
japan
or
the
straits
settlements
they
carried
hundreds
of
european
passengers
men
and
women
even
little
children
who
were
far
removed
from
the
knowledge
that
tragedies
such
as
this
dyak
horror
lay
almost
in
their
path
people
in
london
were
just
going
to
the
theater
he
recalled
the
familiar
jingle
of
the
hansoms
scampering
along
piccadilly
the
more
stately
pace
of
the
private
carriages
crossing
the
park
was
it
possible
that
in
the
world
of
today
the
world
of
telegraphs
and
express
trains
of
the
newspaper
and
the
motor
car
two
inoffensive
human
beings
could
be
done
to
death
so
shamefully
and
openly
as
would
be
the
fate
of
iris
and
himself
if
they
fell
into
the
hands
of
these
savages
it
was
inconceivable
intolerable
but
it
was
true
and
then
by
an
odd
trick
of
memory
his
mind
reverted
not
to
the
yorkshire
manor
he
learnt
to
love
as
a
boy
but
to
a
little
french
inland
town
where
he
once
passed
a
summer
holiday
intent
on
improving
his
knowledge
of
the
language
interior
france
is
even
more
remote
more
secluded
more
provincial
than
agricultural
england
there
no
breath
of
the
outer
world
intrudes
all
is
laborious
circumspect
a
trifle
but
beautified
by
an
arcadian
simplicity
yet
one
memorable
day
when
walking
by
the
banks
of
a
river
he
came
upon
three
men
dragging
from
out
a
pool
the
body
of
a
young
girl
into
whose
fair
forehead
the
blunt
knob
often
seen
on
the
back
of
an
axe
had
been
driven
with
cruel
force
so
even
in
that
tiny
hamlet
murder
and
lust
could
stalk
hand
in
hand
he
shuddered
why
did
such
a
hateful
vision
trouble
him
resolutely
banning
the
specter
he
slid
back
down
the
ledge
and
gently
wakened
iris
she
sat
up
instantly
and
gazed
at
him
with
wondering
eyes
fearful
lest
she
should
forget
her
surroundings
he
placed
a
warning
finger
on
his
lips
oh
she
said
in
a
whisper
are
they
still
here
he
told
her
what
had
happened
and
suggested
that
they
should
have
something
to
eat
whilst
the
coast
was
clear
beneath
she
needed
no
second
bidding
for
the
long
vigil
of
the
previous
night
had
made
her
very
hungry
and
the
two
breakfasted
right
royally
on
biscuit
cold
fowl
ham
and
good
water
in
this
the
inner
section
of
their
refuge
they
could
be
seen
only
by
a
bird
or
by
a
man
standing
on
the
distant
rocky
shelf
that
formed
the
southern
extremity
of
the
opposite
cliff
and
the
sailor
kept
a
close
lookout
in
that
direction
iris
was
about
to
throw
the
remains
of
the
feast
into
an
empty
provided
for
refuse
when
jenks
restrained
her
no
he
said
smilingly
scraps
should
be
the
first
course
next
time
we
must
not
waste
an
atom
of
food
how
thoughtless
of
me
she
exclaimed
please
tell
me
you
think
they
will
go
away
today
but
the
sailor
flung
himself
flat
on
the
ledge
and
grasped
a
be
still
on
your
life
he
said
squeeze
into
your
corner
there
is
a
dyak
on
the
opposite
cliff
true
enough
a
man
had
climbed
to
that
unhappily
placed
rocky
table
and
was
shouting
something
to
a
confrère
high
on
the
cliff
over
their
heads
as
yet
he
had
not
seen
them
nor
even
noticed
the
place
where
they
were
concealed
the
sailor
imagined
from
the
dyak
gestures
that
he
was
communicating
the
uselessness
of
further
search
on
the
western
part
of
the
island
when
the
conversation
ceased
he
hoped
the
savage
would
descend
but
no
the
scout
looked
into
the
valley
at
the
well
the
house
the
cave
still
he
did
not
see
the
ledge
at
that
unlucky
moment
three
birds
driven
from
the
trees
on
the
crest
by
the
passage
of
the
dyaks
flew
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
began
a
circling
quest
for
some
safe
perch
on
which
to
alight
jenks
swore
with
an
emphasis
not
the
less
earnest
because
it
was
mute
and
took
steady
aim
at
the
dyak
left
breast
the
birds
fluttered
about
in
ever
smaller
circles
then
one
of
them
dropped
easily
on
to
the
lip
of
the
rock
instantly
his
bright
eyes
encountered
those
of
the
man
and
he
darted
off
with
a
scream
that
brought
his
mates
after
him
the
dyak
evidently
noted
the
behavior
of
the
birds
his
only
lore
was
the
reading
of
such
signs
and
gazed
intently
at
the
ledge
jenks
he
could
not
distinguish
behind
the
screen
of
grass
he
might
perhaps
see
some
portion
of
the
tarpaulin
covering
the
stores
but
at
the
distance
it
must
resemble
a
segment
of
the
cliff
yet
something
puzzled
him
after
a
steady
scrutiny
he
turned
and
yelled
to
others
on
the
beach
the
crucial
moment
had
arrived
jenks
pressed
the
trigger
and
the
dyak
hurtled
through
the
air
falling
headlong
out
of
sight
the
sound
of
this
the
first
shot
of
real
warfare
awoke
rainbow
island
into
tremendous
activity
the
winged
life
of
the
place
filled
the
air
with
raucous
cries
whilst
shouting
dyaks
scurried
in
all
directions
several
came
into
the
valley
those
nearest
the
fallen
man
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
to
the
well
he
was
quite
dead
and
although
amidst
his
other
injuries
they
soon
found
the
bullet
wound
they
evidently
did
not
know
whence
the
shot
came
for
those
to
whom
he
shouted
had
no
inkling
of
his
motive
and
the
slight
haze
from
the
rifle
was
instantly
swept
away
by
the
breeze
iris
could
hear
the
turmoil
beneath
and
she
tremulously
asked
are
they
going
to
attack
us
not
yet
was
the
reassuring
answer
i
killed
the
fellow
who
saw
us
before
he
could
tell
the
others
it
was
a
bold
risk
and
he
had
taken
it
though
now
the
dyaks
knew
for
certain
their
prey
had
not
escaped
there
was
no
prospect
of
their
speedy
departure
nevertheless
the
position
was
not
utterly
hopeless
none
of
the
enemy
could
tell
how
or
by
whom
their
companion
had
been
shot
many
among
the
excited
horde
jabbering
beneath
actually
looked
at
the
cliff
over
and
over
again
yet
failed
to
note
the
potentialities
of
the
ledge
with
its
few
tufts
of
grass
growing
where
seeds
had
apparently
been
blown
by
the
wind
or
dropped
by
passing
birds
jenks
understood
of
course
that
the
real
danger
would
arise
when
they
visited
the
scene
of
their
comrade
disaster
even
then
the
wavering
balance
of
chance
might
cast
the
issue
in
his
favor
he
could
only
wait
with
ready
rifle
with
the
light
of
battle
lowering
in
his
eyes
of
one
thing
at
least
he
was
certain
before
they
conquered
him
he
would
levy
a
terrible
toll
he
glanced
back
at
iris
her
face
was
pale
beneath
its
mask
of
sunbrown
she
was
bent
over
her
bible
and
jenks
did
not
know
that
she
was
reading
the
psalm
her
lips
murmured
i
will
say
unto
the
lord
he
is
my
refuge
and
my
fortress
my
god
in
him
will
i
trust
the
chief
was
listening
intently
to
the
story
of
the
dyak
who
saw
the
dead
man
totter
and
fall
he
gave
some
quick
order
followed
by
a
score
or
more
of
his
men
he
walked
rapidly
to
the
foot
of
the
cliff
where
they
found
the
lifeless
body
and
iris
read
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
night
nor
for
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
day
jenks
stole
one
more
hasty
glance
at
her
the
chief
and
the
greater
number
of
his
followers
were
out
of
sight
behind
the
rocks
some
of
them
must
now
be
climbing
to
that
fatal
ledge
was
this
the
end
yet
the
girl
unconscious
of
the
doom
impending
kept
her
eyes
steadfastly
fixed
on
the
book
for
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee
to
keep
thee
in
all
thy
ways
they
shall
bear
thee
up
in
their
hands
lest
thou
dash
thy
foot
against
a
stone
he
shall
call
upon
me
and
i
will
answer
him
i
will
be
with
him
in
trouble
i
will
deliver
him
and
honour
him
iris
did
not
apply
the
consoling
words
to
herself
she
closed
the
book
and
bent
forward
sufficiently
in
her
sheltering
niche
to
permit
her
to
gaze
with
wistful
tenderness
upon
the
man
whom
she
hoped
to
see
delivered
and
honored
she
knew
he
would
dare
all
for
her
sake
she
could
only
pray
and
hope
after
reading
those
inspired
verses
she
placed
implicit
trust
in
the
promise
made
for
he
was
good
his
was
the
mercy
that
endureth
forever
enemies
encompassed
them
with
words
of
hatred
fought
against
them
without
a
cause
but
there
was
one
who
should
judge
among
the
heathen
and
fill
the
places
with
dead
bodies
suddenly
a
clamor
of
discordant
yells
fell
upon
her
ears
jenks
rose
to
his
knees
the
dyaks
had
discovered
their
refuge
and
were
about
to
open
fire
he
offered
them
a
target
lest
perchance
iris
were
not
thoroughly
screened
keep
close
he
said
they
have
found
us
lead
will
be
flying
around
soon
she
flinched
back
into
the
crevice
the
sailor
fell
prone
four
bullets
spat
into
the
ledge
of
which
three
pierced
the
tarpaulin
and
one
flattened
itself
against
the
rock
then
jenks
took
up
the
tale
so
curiously
constituted
was
this
man
that
although
he
ruthlessly
shot
the
savage
who
first
spied
out
their
retreat
he
was
swayed
only
by
the
dictates
of
stern
necessity
there
was
a
feeble
chance
that
further
bloodshed
might
be
averted
that
chance
had
passed
very
well
the
enemy
must
start
the
dreadful
game
about
to
be
played
they
had
thrown
the
gage
and
he
answered
them
four
times
did
the
carry
death
unseen
almost
unfelt
across
the
valley
ere
the
fourth
dyak
collapsed
limply
where
he
stood
others
were
there
firing
at
the
little
puff
of
smoke
above
the
grass
they
got
in
a
few
shots
most
of
which
sprayed
at
various
angles
off
the
face
of
the
cliff
but
they
waited
for
no
more
when
the
lever
of
the
was
shoved
home
for
the
fifth
time
the
opposing
crest
was
bare
of
all
opponents
save
two
and
they
lay
motionless
the
fate
of
the
flanking
detachment
was
either
unperceived
or
unheeded
by
the
dyaks
left
in
the
vicinity
of
the
house
and
well
astounded
by
the
firing
that
burst
forth
in
jenks
had
cleared
the
dangerous
rock
before
they
realized
that
here
above
their
heads
were
the
white
man
and
the
maid
whom
they
sought
with
stupid
zeal
they
blazed
away
furiously
only
succeeding
in
showering
fragments
of
splintered
stone
into
the
eagle
nest
and
the
sailor
smiled
he
quietly
picked
up
an
old
coat
rolled
it
into
a
ball
and
pushed
it
into
sight
amidst
the
grass
then
he
squirmed
round
on
his
stomach
and
took
up
a
position
ten
feet
away
of
course
those
who
still
carried
loaded
guns
discharged
them
at
the
bundle
of
rags
whereupon
jenks
thrust
his
rifle
beyond
the
edge
of
the
rock
and
leaned
over
three
dyaks
fell
before
the
remainder
made
up
their
minds
to
run
once
convinced
however
that
running
was
good
for
their
health
they
moved
with
much
celerity
the
remaining
cartridges
in
the
magazine
slackened
the
pace
of
two
of
their
number
jenks
dropped
the
empty
weapon
and
seized
another
he
stood
up
now
and
sent
a
quick
reminder
after
the
rearmost
pirate
the
others
had
disappeared
towards
the
locality
where
their
leader
and
his
diminished
troupe
were
gathered
not
daring
to
again
come
within
range
of
the
whistling
the
sailor
holding
his
rifle
as
though
bent
forward
and
sought
a
belated
opponent
but
in
vain
in
military
phrase
the
was
clear
of
the
enemy
there
was
no
sound
save
the
wailing
of
birds
the
soft
sough
of
the
sea
and
the
yelling
of
the
three
wounded
men
in
the
house
who
knew
not
what
terrors
threatened
and
vainly
bawled
for
succor
again
jenks
could
look
at
iris
her
face
was
bleeding
the
sight
maddened
him
my
god
he
groaned
are
you
wounded
she
smiled
bravely
at
him
it
is
nothing
she
said
a
mere
splash
from
the
rock
which
cut
my
forehead
he
dared
not
go
to
her
he
could
only
hope
that
it
was
no
worse
so
he
turned
to
examine
the
valley
once
more
for
vestige
of
a
living
foe
chapter
xii
a
truce
though
his
eyes
like
live
coals
glowered
with
sullen
fire
at
the
strip
of
sand
and
the
rocks
in
front
his
troubled
brain
paid
perfunctory
heed
to
his
task
the
stern
sense
of
duty
the
ingrained
force
of
long
years
of
military
discipline
and
soldierly
thought
compelled
him
to
keep
watch
and
ward
over
his
fortress
but
he
could
not
help
asking
himself
what
would
happen
if
iris
were
seriously
wounded
there
was
one
enemy
more
potent
than
these
skulking
dyaks
a
foe
more
irresistible
in
his
might
more
pitiless
in
his
strength
whose
assaults
would
tax
to
the
utmost
their
powers
of
resistance
in
another
hour
the
sun
would
be
high
in
the
heavens
pouring
his
ardent
rays
upon
them
and
drying
the
blood
in
their
veins
hitherto
the
active
life
of
the
island
the
shade
of
trees
hut
or
cave
the
power
of
unrestricted
movement
and
the
possession
of
water
in
any
desired
quantity
robbed
the
tropical
heat
of
the
day
of
its
chief
terrors
now
all
was
changed
instead
of
working
amidst
grateful
foliage
they
were
bound
to
the
brown
rock
which
soon
would
glow
with
radiated
energy
and
give
off
scorching
gusts
like
unto
the
opening
of
a
this
he
had
foreseen
all
along
the
tarpaulin
would
yield
them
some
degree
of
uneasy
protection
and
they
both
were
in
perfect
physical
condition
but
if
iris
were
wounded
if
the
extra
strain
brought
fever
in
its
wake
that
way
he
saw
nothing
but
blank
despair
to
be
ended
for
her
by
delirium
and
merciful
death
for
him
by
a
berserk
rush
among
the
dyaks
and
one
last
mad
fight
against
overwhelming
numbers
then
the
girl
voice
reached
him
almost
cheerful
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
the
cut
has
stopped
bleeding
it
is
only
a
scratch
so
a
kindly
providence
had
spared
them
yet
a
little
while
the
cloud
passed
from
his
mind
the
gathering
mist
from
his
eyes
in
that
instant
he
thought
he
detected
a
slight
rustling
among
the
trees
where
the
cliff
shelved
up
from
the
house
standing
as
he
was
on
the
edge
of
the
rock
this
was
a
point
he
could
not
guard
against
when
her
welcome
assurance
recalled
his
scattered
senses
he
stepped
back
to
speak
to
her
and
in
the
same
instant
a
couple
of
bullets
crashed
against
the
rock
overhead
iris
had
unwittingly
saved
him
from
a
serious
perhaps
fatal
wound
he
sprang
to
the
extreme
right
of
the
ledge
and
boldly
looked
into
the
trees
beneath
two
dyaks
were
there
belated
wanderers
cut
off
from
the
main
body
they
dived
headlong
into
the
undergrowth
for
safety
but
one
of
them
was
too
late
the
reached
him
and
its
reverberating
concussion
tossed
back
and
forth
by
the
echoing
rocks
drowned
his
parting
scream
in
the
plenitude
of
restored
vigor
the
sailor
waited
for
no
counter
demonstration
he
turned
and
crouchingly
approached
the
southern
end
of
his
parapet
through
his
screen
of
grass
he
could
discern
the
long
black
hair
and
yellow
face
of
a
man
who
lay
on
the
sand
and
twisted
his
head
around
the
base
of
the
further
cliff
the
distance
oft
measured
was
ninety
yards
the
target
practically
a
jenks
took
careful
aim
fired
and
a
whiff
of
sand
flew
up
perhaps
he
had
used
too
fine
a
sight
and
ploughed
a
furrow
beneath
the
dyak
ear
he
only
heard
a
faint
yell
but
the
enterprising
head
vanished
and
there
were
no
more
volunteers
for
that
particular
service
he
was
still
peering
at
the
place
when
a
cry
of
unmitigated
anguish
came
from
iris
oh
come
quick
our
water
the
casks
have
burst
it
was
not
until
jenks
had
torn
the
tarpaulin
from
off
their
stores
and
he
was
wildly
striving
with
both
hands
to
scoop
up
some
precious
drops
collected
in
the
small
hollows
of
the
ledge
that
he
realized
the
full
magnitude
of
the
disaster
which
had
befallen
them
during
the
first
rapid
exchange
of
fire
before
the
enemy
vacated
the
cliff
several
bullets
had
pierced
the
tarpaulin
by
a
stroke
of
exceeding
bad
fortune
two
of
them
had
struck
each
of
the
and
started
the
staves
the
contents
quietly
ebbed
away
beneath
the
broad
sheet
and
flowing
inwards
by
reason
of
the
sharp
slope
of
the
ledge
percolated
through
the
fault
iris
and
he
notwithstanding
their
frenzied
efforts
were
not
able
to
save
more
than
a
pint
of
gritty
discolored
fluid
the
rest
infinitely
more
valuable
to
them
than
all
the
diamonds
of
de
beers
was
now
oozing
through
the
natural
channel
cut
by
centuries
of
storm
dripping
upon
the
headless
skeleton
in
the
cave
soaking
down
to
the
very
heart
of
their
buried
treasure
jenks
was
so
paralyzed
by
this
catastrophe
that
iris
became
alarmed
as
yet
she
did
not
grasp
its
awful
significance
that
he
her
hero
so
brave
so
confident
in
the
face
of
many
dangers
should
betray
such
sense
of
irredeemable
loss
frightened
her
much
more
than
the
incident
itself
her
lips
whitened
her
words
become
incoherent
tell
me
she
whispered
i
can
bear
anything
but
silence
tell
me
i
implore
you
is
it
so
bad
the
sight
of
her
distress
sobered
him
he
ground
his
teeth
together
as
a
man
does
who
submits
to
a
painful
operation
and
resolves
not
to
flinch
beneath
the
knife
it
is
very
bad
he
said
not
quite
the
end
but
near
it
the
end
she
bravely
answered
is
death
we
are
living
and
uninjured
you
must
fight
on
if
the
lord
wills
it
we
shall
not
die
he
looked
in
her
blue
eyes
and
saw
there
the
light
of
heaven
god
bless
you
dear
girl
he
murmured
brokenly
you
would
cheer
any
man
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
were
he
christian
or
her
glance
did
not
droop
before
his
in
such
moments
heart
speaks
to
heart
without
concealment
we
still
have
a
little
water
she
cried
fortunately
we
are
not
thirsty
you
have
not
forgotten
our
supply
of
champagne
and
brandy
there
was
a
species
of
mad
humor
in
the
suggestion
oh
for
another
miracle
that
should
change
the
wine
into
water
he
could
only
fall
in
with
her
unreflective
mood
and
leave
the
dreadful
truth
to
its
own
evil
time
in
their
little
nook
the
power
of
the
sun
had
not
yet
made
itself
felt
by
ordinary
computation
it
was
about
nine
long
before
noon
they
would
be
grilling
throughout
the
next
few
hours
they
must
suffer
the
torture
of
dives
with
one
meager
pint
of
water
to
share
between
them
of
course
the
wine
and
spirit
must
be
shunned
like
a
pestilence
to
touch
either
under
such
conditions
would
be
courting
heat
apoplexy
and
death
and
next
day
he
tightened
his
jaws
before
he
answered
we
will
console
ourselves
with
a
bottle
of
champagne
for
dinner
meanwhile
i
hear
our
friends
shouting
to
those
left
on
this
side
of
the
island
i
must
take
an
active
interest
in
the
conversation
he
grasped
a
rifle
and
lay
down
on
the
ledge
already
gratefully
warm
there
was
a
good
deal
of
sustained
shouting
going
on
jenks
thought
he
recognized
the
chief
voice
giving
instructions
to
those
who
had
come
from
smugglers
cove
and
were
now
standing
on
the
beach
near
the
quarry
i
wonder
if
he
is
hungry
he
thought
if
so
i
will
interfere
with
the
commissariat
iris
peeped
forth
at
him
mr
jenks
yes
without
turning
his
head
he
knew
it
was
an
ordinary
question
may
i
come
too
what
expose
yourself
on
the
ledge
yes
even
that
i
am
so
tired
of
sitting
here
alone
well
there
is
no
danger
at
present
but
they
might
chance
to
see
you
and
you
remember
what
i
yes
i
remember
quite
well
if
that
is
all
there
was
a
rustle
of
garments
i
am
very
mannish
in
appearance
if
you
promise
not
to
look
at
me
i
will
join
you
i
promise
iris
stepped
forth
she
was
flushed
a
little
and
to
cover
her
confusion
may
be
she
picked
up
a
now
there
are
two
guns
she
said
as
she
stood
near
him
he
could
see
through
the
tail
of
his
eye
that
a
slight
but
elegantly
proportioned
young
gentleman
of
the
profession
had
suddenly
appeared
from
nowhere
he
was
glad
she
had
taken
this
course
it
might
better
the
position
were
the
dyaks
to
see
her
thus
the
moment
i
tell
you
you
must
fall
flat
he
warned
her
no
ceremony
about
it
just
flop
i
do
know
anything
better
calculated
to
make
one
flop
than
a
bullet
she
laughed
not
yet
did
the
tragedy
of
the
broken
kegs
appeal
to
her
yes
but
it
achieves
its
purpose
in
two
ways
i
want
you
to
adopt
the
precautionary
method
trust
me
for
that
good
gracious
the
sailor
rifle
went
off
with
an
unexpected
bang
that
froze
the
exclamation
on
her
lips
three
dyaks
were
attempting
to
run
the
gauntlet
to
their
beleaguered
comrades
they
carried
a
jar
and
two
wicker
baskets
he
with
the
jar
fell
and
broke
it
the
others
doubled
back
like
hares
and
the
first
man
dragged
himself
after
them
jenks
did
not
fire
again
iris
watched
the
wounded
wretch
crawling
along
the
ground
her
eyes
grew
moist
and
she
paled
somewhat
when
he
vanished
she
looked
into
the
valley
and
at
the
opposing
ledge
three
men
lay
dead
within
twenty
yards
of
her
two
others
dangled
from
the
rocks
it
took
her
some
time
to
control
her
quavering
utterance
sufficiently
to
say
i
hope
i
may
not
have
to
use
a
gun
i
know
it
can
not
be
helped
but
if
i
were
to
kill
a
human
being
i
do
not
think
i
would
ever
rest
again
in
that
case
i
have
indeed
murdered
sleep
today
was
the
unfeeling
reply
no
no
a
man
must
be
made
of
sterner
stuff
we
have
a
right
to
defend
ourselves
if
need
be
i
will
exercise
that
right
still
it
is
horrid
oh
so
horrid
she
could
not
see
the
sailor
grim
smile
it
would
materially
affect
his
rest
for
the
better
were
he
able
to
slay
every
dyak
on
the
island
with
a
single
shot
yet
her
gentle
protest
pleased
him
she
could
not
at
the
same
time
be
callous
to
human
suffering
and
be
iris
but
he
declined
the
discussion
of
such
sentiments
you
were
going
to
say
something
when
a
brief
disturbance
took
place
he
inquired
yes
i
was
surprised
to
find
how
hot
the
ledge
has
become
you
notice
it
more
because
you
are
obliged
to
remain
here
after
a
pause
i
think
i
understand
now
why
you
were
so
upset
by
the
loss
of
our
water
supply
before
the
day
ends
we
will
be
in
great
straits
enduring
agonies
from
thirst
let
us
not
meet
the
devil
he
rejoined
he
preferred
the
unfair
retort
to
a
confession
which
could
only
foster
dismay
but
please
i
am
thirsty
now
he
moved
uneasily
he
was
only
too
conscious
of
the
impish
weakness
common
to
all
mankind
which
creates
a
desire
out
of
sheer
inability
to
satisfy
it
already
his
own
throat
was
parched
the
excitement
of
the
early
struggle
was
in
itself
enough
to
engender
an
acute
thirst
he
thought
it
best
to
meet
their
absolute
needs
as
far
as
possible
bring
the
tin
cup
he
said
let
us
take
half
our
store
and
use
the
remainder
when
we
eat
try
to
avoid
breathing
through
your
mouth
the
hot
air
quickly
affects
the
palate
and
causes
an
artificial
dryness
we
can
not
yet
be
in
real
need
of
water
it
is
largely
imagination
iris
needed
no
second
bidding
she
carefully
measured
out
half
a
pint
of
the
unsavory
fluid
the
dregs
of
the
casks
and
the
scourings
of
the
ledge
i
will
drink
first
she
cried
no
no
he
interrupted
impatiently
give
it
to
me
she
pretended
to
be
surprised
as
a
mere
matter
of
politeness
i
am
sorry
but
i
must
insist
she
gave
him
the
cup
over
his
shoulder
he
placed
it
to
his
lips
and
gulped
steadily
there
he
said
gruffly
i
was
in
a
hurry
the
dyaks
may
make
another
rush
at
any
moment
iris
looked
into
the
vessel
you
have
taken
none
at
all
she
said
nonsense
jenks
be
reasonable
you
need
it
more
than
i
want
to
live
you
his
hands
shook
somewhat
it
was
well
there
was
no
call
for
accurate
shooting
just
then
i
assure
you
i
took
all
i
required
he
declared
with
unnecessary
vehemence
at
least
drink
your
share
to
please
me
she
murmured
you
wished
to
humbug
me
he
grumbled
if
you
will
take
the
first
half
i
will
take
the
second
and
they
settled
it
that
way
the
few
mouthfuls
of
tepid
water
gave
them
new
life
one
sense
can
deceive
the
others
a
man
developing
all
the
symptoms
of
hydrophobia
has
been
cured
by
the
assurance
that
the
dog
which
bit
him
was
not
mad
so
these
two
not
yet
aflame
with
drought
banished
the
arid
phantom
for
a
little
while
nevertheless
by
high
noon
they
were
suffering
again
the
time
passed
very
slowly
the
sun
rose
to
the
zenith
and
filled
earth
and
air
with
his
ardor
it
seemed
to
be
a
miracle
now
appreciated
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
that
the
sea
did
not
dry
up
and
the
leaves
wither
on
the
trees
the
silence
the
deathly
inactivity
of
all
things
became
intolerable
the
girl
bravely
tried
to
confine
her
thoughts
to
the
task
of
the
hour
she
displayed
alert
watchfulness
an
instant
readiness
to
warn
her
companion
of
the
slightest
movement
among
the
trees
or
by
the
rocks
to
the
this
being
the
arc
of
their
periphery
assigned
to
her
looking
at
a
sunlit
space
from
cover
and
looking
at
the
same
place
when
sweltering
in
the
direct
rays
of
a
tropical
sun
are
kindred
operations
strangely
diverse
in
achievement
iris
could
not
reconcile
the
physical
sensitiveness
of
the
hour
with
the
careless
hardihood
of
the
preceding
days
her
eyes
ached
somewhat
for
she
had
tilted
her
to
the
back
of
her
head
in
the
effort
to
cool
her
throbbing
temples
she
put
up
her
right
hand
to
shade
the
too
vivid
reflection
of
the
glistening
sea
and
was
astounded
to
find
that
in
a
few
minutes
the
back
of
her
hand
was
scorched
a
faint
sound
of
distant
shouting
disturbed
her
painful
reverie
how
is
it
she
asked
that
we
feel
the
heat
so
much
today
i
have
hardly
noticed
it
before
for
two
good
reasons
forced
idleness
and
radiation
from
this
confounded
rock
moreover
this
is
the
hottest
day
we
have
experienced
on
the
island
there
is
not
a
breath
of
air
and
the
hot
weather
has
just
commenced
do
you
think
she
said
huskily
that
our
position
here
is
quite
hopeless
they
were
talking
to
each
other
sideways
the
sailor
never
turned
his
gaze
from
the
southern
end
of
the
valley
it
is
no
more
hopeless
now
than
last
night
or
this
morning
he
replied
but
suppose
we
are
kept
here
for
several
days
that
was
always
an
unpleasant
probability
we
had
water
then
even
with
an
ample
supply
it
would
be
difficult
to
hold
out
as
things
are
such
a
course
becomes
simply
impossible
her
despondency
pierced
his
soul
a
slow
agony
was
consuming
her
it
is
hard
i
admit
he
said
nevertheless
you
must
bear
up
until
night
falls
then
we
will
either
obtain
water
or
leave
this
place
surely
we
can
do
neither
we
may
be
compelled
to
do
both
but
how
in
this
his
hour
of
extremest
need
the
man
was
vouchsafed
a
shred
of
luck
to
answer
her
satisfactorily
would
have
baffled
a
talleyrand
but
before
he
could
frame
a
feeble
pretext
for
his
too
sanguine
prediction
a
sampan
appeared
eight
hundred
yards
from
turtle
beach
and
strenuously
paddled
by
three
men
the
vague
hallooing
they
had
heard
was
explained
the
dyaks
though
to
the
manner
born
were
weary
of
rocks
and
salt
water
the
boat
was
coming
in
response
to
their
signals
and
the
sight
inspired
jenks
with
fresh
hope
like
a
lightning
flash
came
the
reflection
that
if
he
could
keep
them
away
from
the
well
and
destroy
the
sampan
now
hastening
to
their
assistance
perhaps
conveying
the
bulk
of
their
stores
they
would
soon
tire
of
slaking
their
thirst
on
the
few
growing
on
the
north
shore
come
quick
he
shouted
adjusting
the
backsight
of
a
rifle
lie
down
and
aim
at
the
front
of
that
boat
a
little
short
if
anything
it
does
matter
if
the
bullets
strike
the
sea
first
he
placed
the
weapon
in
readiness
for
her
and
commenced
operations
himself
before
iris
could
reach
his
side
soon
both
rifles
were
pitching
twenty
shots
a
minute
at
the
sampan
the
result
of
their
practice
was
not
long
in
doubt
the
dyaks
danced
from
seat
to
seat
in
a
state
of
wild
excitement
one
man
was
hurled
overboard
then
the
craft
lurched
seaward
in
the
strong
current
and
jenks
told
iris
to
leave
the
rest
to
him
before
he
could
empty
a
second
magazine
a
fortunate
bullet
ripped
a
plank
out
and
the
sampan
filled
and
went
down
amidst
a
shrill
yell
of
execration
from
the
back
of
the
cliff
the
two
dyaks
yet
living
endeavored
to
swim
ashore
half
a
mile
through
reefs
the
sailor
did
not
even
trouble
about
them
after
a
few
frantic
struggles
each
doomed
wretch
flung
up
his
arms
and
vanished
in
the
clear
atmosphere
the
could
see
black
fins
cutting
the
pellucid
sea
this
exciting
episode
dispelled
the
gathering
mists
from
the
brain
her
eyes
danced
and
she
breathed
hard
yet
something
worried
her
i
hope
i
did
hit
the
man
who
fell
out
of
the
boat
she
said
oh
came
the
prompt
assurance
i
took
deliberate
aim
at
that
chap
he
was
a
most
persistent
scoundrel
iris
was
satisfied
jenks
thought
it
better
to
lie
than
to
tell
the
truth
for
the
bald
facts
hardly
bore
out
his
assertion
judging
from
the
manner
of
the
dyak
involuntary
plunge
he
had
been
hit
by
a
ricochet
bullet
whilst
the
sailor
efforts
were
wholly
confined
to
sinking
the
sampan
however
let
it
pass
bullet
or
shark
the
end
was
the
same
they
were
quieting
down
the
thirst
fiend
was
again
slowly
salting
their
veins
when
something
of
a
dirty
white
color
fluttered
into
sight
from
behind
the
base
of
the
opposite
cliff
it
was
rapidly
withdrawn
to
reappear
after
an
interval
now
it
was
held
more
steadily
and
a
brown
arm
became
visible
as
jenks
did
not
fire
a
turbaned
head
popped
into
sight
it
was
the
mahommedan
no
shoot
it
he
roared
me
english
speak
it
do
you
speak
hindustani
shouted
jenks
in
urdu
of
the
higher
proficiency
hañ
sahib
footnote
yes
sir
was
the
joyful
response
will
your
honor
permit
his
servant
to
come
and
talk
with
him
yes
if
you
come
unarmed
and
the
chief
too
sahib
yes
but
listen
on
the
first
sign
of
treachery
i
shoot
both
of
you
we
will
keep
faith
sahib
may
kites
pick
our
bones
if
we
fail
then
there
stepped
into
full
view
the
renegade
mussulman
and
his
leader
they
carried
no
guns
the
chief
wore
his
kriss
illustration
the
two
halted
some
ten
paces
in
front
of
the
cavern
and
the
belligerents
surveyed
each
other
tell
him
to
leave
that
dagger
behind
cried
the
sailor
imperiously
as
the
enemy
demanded
a
parley
he
resolved
to
adopt
the
tone
from
the
outset
the
chief
obeyed
with
a
scowl
and
the
two
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
rock
stand
close
to
me
said
jenks
to
iris
let
them
see
you
plainly
but
pull
your
hat
well
down
over
your
eyes
she
silently
followed
his
instructions
now
that
the
very
crisis
of
their
fate
had
arrived
she
was
nervous
shaken
conscious
only
of
a
desire
to
sink
on
her
knees
and
pray
one
or
two
curious
heads
were
craned
round
the
corner
of
the
rock
stop
cried
jenks
if
those
men
do
not
instantly
go
away
i
will
fire
at
them
the
indian
translated
this
order
and
the
chief
vociferated
some
clanging
syllables
which
had
the
desired
effect
the
two
halted
some
ten
paces
in
front
of
the
cavern
and
the
belligerents
surveyed
each
other
it
was
a
fascinating
spectacle
this
drama
in
real
life
the
dyak
gaudily
attired
in
a
crimson
jacket
and
pantaloons
of
chinese
silk
a
man
with
the
du
young
and
powerfully
built
and
the
mahommedan
bony
tall
and
grey
with
hardship
looked
up
at
the
occupants
of
the
ledge
iris
slim
and
boyish
in
her
male
garments
was
dwarfed
by
the
sailor
but
her
face
was
and
jenks
wore
a
six
weeks
stubble
of
beard
holding
their
with
alert
ease
with
revolvers
strapped
to
their
sides
they
presented
a
warlike
and
imposing
tableau
in
their
inaccessible
perch
in
the
path
of
the
emissaries
lay
the
bodies
of
the
slain
the
dyak
leader
scowled
again
as
he
passed
them
sahib
began
the
indian
my
chief
taung
does
not
wish
to
have
any
more
of
his
men
killed
in
a
foolish
quarrel
about
a
woman
give
her
up
he
says
and
he
will
either
leave
you
here
in
peace
or
carry
you
safely
to
some
place
where
you
can
find
a
ship
manned
by
white
men
a
woman
said
jenks
scornfully
that
is
idle
talk
what
woman
is
here
this
question
nonplussed
the
native
the
woman
whom
the
chief
saw
half
a
month
back
sahib
taung
was
bewitched
i
slew
his
men
so
quickly
that
he
saw
spirits
the
chief
caught
his
name
and
broke
in
with
a
question
a
volley
of
talk
between
the
two
was
enlivened
with
expressive
gestures
by
taung
who
several
times
pointed
to
iris
and
jenks
now
anathematized
his
thoughtless
folly
in
permitting
the
dyak
to
approach
so
near
the
mahommedan
of
course
had
never
seen
her
and
might
have
persuaded
the
other
that
in
truth
there
were
two
men
only
on
the
rock
his
fears
were
only
too
well
founded
the
mussulman
salaamed
respectfully
and
said
protector
of
the
poor
i
can
not
gainsay
your
word
but
taung
says
that
the
maid
stands
by
your
side
and
is
none
the
less
the
woman
he
seeks
in
that
she
wears
a
man
clothing
he
has
sharp
eyes
but
his
brain
is
addled
retorted
the
sailor
why
does
he
come
here
to
seek
a
woman
who
is
not
of
his
race
not
only
has
he
brought
death
to
his
people
and
narrowly
escaped
it
himself
but
he
must
know
that
any
violence
offered
to
us
will
mean
the
extermination
of
his
whole
tribe
by
an
english
warship
tell
him
to
take
away
his
boats
and
never
visit
this
isle
again
perhaps
i
will
then
forget
his
treacherous
attempt
to
murder
us
whilst
we
slept
last
night
the
chief
glared
back
defiantly
whilst
the
mahommedan
said
sahib
it
is
beet
not
to
anger
him
too
much
he
says
he
means
to
have
the
girl
he
saw
her
beauty
that
day
and
she
inflamed
his
heart
she
has
cost
him
many
lives
but
she
is
worth
a
sultan
ransom
he
cares
not
for
warships
they
can
not
reach
his
village
in
the
hills
by
the
tomb
of
sahib
he
will
not
harm
you
if
you
give
her
up
but
if
you
refuse
he
will
kill
you
both
and
what
is
one
woman
more
or
less
in
the
world
that
she
should
cause
strife
and
the
sailor
knew
the
eastern
character
too
well
not
to
understand
the
man
amazement
that
he
should
be
so
solicitous
about
the
fate
of
one
of
the
weaker
sex
it
was
seemingly
useless
to
offer
terms
yet
the
native
was
clearly
so
anxious
for
an
amicable
settlement
that
he
caught
at
a
straw
you
come
from
delhi
he
asked
honored
one
you
have
great
wisdom
none
but

swears

sahib
i
did
but
slay
a
man
in
whatever
the
cause
you
can
never

nevertheless
you
would
give
many
years

gurgled

your

leave

him

against
him
i

this

you
away

footnote
the

taung
was
evidently
bewildered
and
annoyed
by
this
passionate
appeal
which
he
did
not
understand
he
demanded
an
explanation
and
the
native
was
obliged
to
invent
some
plausible
excuse
yet
when
he
raised
his
face
to
jenks

was
the
look

me

they
would
cut
my
throat
if
i
were
with
you

on

the

befell
me
it

you
will
not
give
up

jenks
heart
bounded
when
this
offer
reached
his
ears
the
unfortunate
mahommedan
was
evidently
eager
to
get
away
from
the
piratical
gang
into
whose
power
he
had
fallen
but
the
chief
was
impatient
if
not
suspicious
of
these
long
speeches
angrily
holding
forth
a
the
sailor
shouted
tell
taung
that
i
will
slay
him
and
all
his
men
ere
sun
rises
he
knows
something
of
my
power
but
not
all
tonight
at
the
twelfth
hour
you
will
find
a
rope
hanging
from
the

not
in
this
i
will
not
forget
your

anstruther
sahib
of
the
belgaum
rissala
the
native
translated
his
words
into
a
fierce
defiance
of
taung
and
his
dyaks
the
chief
glanced
at
jenks
and
iris
with
an
ominous
smile
he
muttered
something
then
sahib
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
beware
of
the
trees
on
your
right
they
can
send
silent
death
even
to
the
place
where
you
stand
and
i
will
not
fail
you
tonight
on
my
life
cried
the
interpreter
i
believe
you
go
but
inform
your
chief
that
once
you
have
disappeared
round
the
rock
whence
you
came
i
will
talk
to
him
only
with
a
rifle
taung
seemed
to
comprehend
the
englishman
emphatic
motions
waving
his
hand
defiantly
the
dyak
turned
and
with
one
parting
glance
of
mute
assurance
the
indian
followed
him
and
now
there
came
to
jenks
a
great
temptation
iris
touched
his
arm
and
whispered
what
have
you
decided
i
did
not
dare
to
speak
lest
he
should
hear
my
voice
poor
girl
she
was
sure
the
dyak
could
not
penetrate
her
disguise
though
she
feared
from
the
manner
in
which
the
conference
broke
up
that
it
had
not
been
satisfactory
jenks
did
not
answer
her
he
knew
that
if
he
killed
taung
his
men
would
be
so
dispirited
that
when
the
night
came
they
would
fly
there
was
so
much
at
stake
iris
wealth
love
happiness
life
itself
all
depended
on
his
plighted
word
yet
his
savage
enemy
a
slayer
of
women
a
human
vampire
soiled
with
every
conceivable
crime
was
stalking
back
to
safety
with
a
certain
dignified
strut
calmly
trusting
to
the
white
man
bond
oh
it
was
cruel
the
ordeal
of
that
ghastly
moment
was
more
trying
than
all
that
he
had
hitherto
experienced
he
gave
a
choking
sob
of
relief
when
the
scoundrel
passed
out
of
sight
without
even
deigning
to
give
another
glance
at
the
ledge
or
at
those
who
silently
watched
him
iris
could
not
guess
the
nature
of
the
mortal
struggle
raging
in
the
sailor
soul
tell
me
she
repeated
what
have
you
done
kept
faith
with
that
swaggering
ruffian
he
said
with
an
odd
feeling
of
thankfulness
that
he
spoke
truly
why
have
you
made
him
any
promise
unhappily
i
permitted
him
to
come
here
so
i
had
to
let
him
go
he
recognized
you
instantly
this
surprised
her
greatly
are
you
sure
i
saw
him
pointing
at
me
but
he
seemed
to
be
in
such
a
bad
temper
that
i
imagined
that
he
was
angry
with
you
for
exchanging
a
prepossessing
young
lady
for
an
youth
jenks
with
difficulty
suppressed
a
sigh
her
words
for
an
instant
had
the
old
piquant
flavor
keeping
a
close
watch
on
the
sheltering
promontory
he
told
her
all
that
had
taken
place
iris
became
very
downcast
when
she
grasped
the
exact
state
of
affairs
she
was
almost
certain
when
the
dyaks
proposed
a
parley
that
reasonable
terms
would
result
it
horrified
her
beyond
measure
to
find
that
she
was
the
rock
on
which
negotiations
were
wrecked
hope
died
within
her
the
bitterness
of
death
was
in
her
breast
what
an
unlucky
influence
i
have
had
on
your
existence
she
exclaimed
if
it
were
not
for
me
this
trouble
at
least
would
be
spared
you
because
i
am
here
you
are
condemned
again
because
i
stopped
you
from
shooting
that
wretched
chief
and
his
companions
they
are
now
demanding
your
life
as
a
forfeit
it
is
all
my
fault
i
can
not
bear
it
she
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
the
strain
had
become
too
great
for
her
after
indulging
in
a
wild
dream
of
freedom
to
be
told
that
they
must
again
endure
the
irksome
confinement
the
active
suffering
the
slow
horrors
of
a
siege
in
that
rocky
prison
almost
distracted
her
jenks
was
very
stern
and
curt
in
his
reply
we
must
make
the
best
of
a
bad
business
he
said
if
we
are
in
a
tight
place
the
dyaks
are
not
much
better
off
and
eighteen
of
their
number
are
dead
or
wounded
you
forget
too
that
providence
has
sent
us
a
most
useful
ally
in
the
mahommedan
when
all
is
said
and
done
things
might
be
far
worse
than
they
are
never
before
had
his
tone
been
so
cold
his
manner
so
abrupt
not
even
in
the
old
days
when
he
purposely
endeavored
to
make
her
dislike
him
she
walked
along
the
ledge
and
timidly
bent
over
him
forgive
me
she
whispered
i
did
forget
for
the
moment
not
only
the
goodness
of
providence
but
also
your
devotion
i
am
only
a
woman
and
i
do
want
to
die
yet
but
i
will
not
live
unless
you
too
are
saved
once
already
that
day
she
had
expressed
this
thought
in
other
words
was
some
shadowy
design
flitting
through
her
brain
suppose
they
were
faced
with
the
alternatives
of
dying
from
thirst
or
yielding
to
the
dyaks
was
there
another
way
out
jenks
shivered
though
the
rock
was
grilling
him
he
must
divert
her
mind
from
this
dreadful
brooding
the
fact
is
he
said
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
cheerfulness
we
are
both
hungry
and
consequently
grumpy
now
suppose
you
prepare
lunch
we
will
feel
ever
so
much
better
after
we
have
eaten
the
girl
choked
back
her
emotion
and
sadly
essayed
the
task
of
providing
a
meal
which
was
hateful
to
her
in
doing
so
she
saw
her
bible
lying
where
she
had
placed
it
that
morning
the
leaves
still
open
at
the
psalm
she
had
indeed
forgotten
the
promise
it
contained
for
he
shall
give
his
angels
charge
over
thee
to
keep
thee
in
all
thy
ways
a
few
tears
fell
now
and
made
little
furrows
down
her
soiled
cheeks
but
they
were
helpful
tears
tears
of
resignation
not
of
despair
although
the
destruction
that
wasteth
at
noonday
was
trying
her
sorely
she
again
felt
strong
and
sustained
she
even
smiled
on
detecting
an
involuntary
effort
to
clear
her
stained
face
she
was
about
to
carry
a
biscuit
and
some
tinned
meat
to
the
sailor
when
a
sharp
exclamation
from
him
caused
her
to
hasten
to
his
side
the
dyaks
had
broken
cover
running
in
scattered
sections
across
the
sands
they
were
risking
such
loss
as
the
defenders
might
be
able
to
inflict
upon
them
during
a
brief
race
to
the
shelter
and
food
to
be
obtained
in
the
other
part
of
the
island
jenks
did
not
fire
at
the
scurrying
gang
he
was
waiting
for
one
man
taung
but
that
redoubtable
person
having
probably
suggested
this
dash
for
liberty
had
fully
realized
the
enviable
share
of
attention
he
would
attract
during
the
passage
he
therefore
discarded
his
vivid
attire
and
by
borrowing
odd
garments
made
himself
sufficiently
like
unto
the
remainder
of
his
crew
to
deceive
the
sailor
until
the
rush
of
men
was
over
among
them
ran
the
mahommedan
who
did
not
look
up
the
valley
but
waved
his
hand
when
all
had
quieted
down
again
jenks
understood
how
he
had
been
fooled
he
laughed
so
heartily
that
iris
not
knowing
either
the
cause
of
his
merriment
or
the
reason
of
his
clemency
to
the
flying
foe
feared
the
sun
had
affected
him
he
at
once
quitted
the
post
occupied
during
so
protracted
a
vigil
now
he
cried
we
can
eat
in
peace
i
have
stripped
the
chief
of
his
finery
his
men
can
twit
him
on
being
forced
to
shed
his
gorgeous
plumage
in
order
to
save
his
life
anyhow
they
will
leave
us
in
peace
until
night
falls
so
we
must
make
the
best
of
a
hot
afternoon
but
he
was
mistaken
a
greater
danger
than
any
yet
experienced
now
threatened
them
though
iris
after
perusing
that
wonderful
psalm
might
have
warned
him
of
it
had
she
known
the
purpose
of
those
long
bamboos
carried
by
some
of
the
savages
for
taung
furious
and
unrelenting
resolved
that
if
he
could
not
obtain
the
girl
he
would
slay
the
pair
of
them
and
he
had
terrible
weapons
in
his
possession
weapons
that
could
send
silent
death
even
to
the
place
where
they
stood

the
heat
is
greatest
or
certainly
least
bearable
between
two
and
four
in
the
afternoon
at
the
conclusion
of
a
not
very
luscious
repast
jenks
suggested
that
they
should
rig
up
the
tarpaulin
in
such
wise
as
to
gain
protection
from
the
sun
and
yet
enable
him
to
cast
a
watchful
eye
over
the
valley
iris
helped
to
raise
the
great
canvas
sheet
on
the
supports
he
had
prepared
once
shut
off
from
the
devouring
sun
rays
the
hot
breeze
then
springing
into
fitful
existence
cooled
their
blistered
but
perspiring
skin
and
made
life
somewhat
tolerable
still
adhering
to
his
policy
of
combatting
the
first
enervating
attacks
of
thirst
the
sailor
sanctioned
the
consumption
of
the
remaining
water
as
a
last
desperate
expedient
to
be
resorted
to
only
in
case
of
sheer
necessity
he
uncorked
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
filled
the
tin
cup
the
sparkling
wine
with
its
volume
of
creamy
foam
looked
so
tempting
that
iris
would
then
and
there
have
risked
its
potency
were
she
not
promptly
withheld
jenks
explained
to
her
that
when
the
wine
became
quite
flat
and
insipid
they
might
use
it
to
moisten
their
parched
lips
even
so
in
their
present
state
the
liquor
was
unquestionably
dangerous
but
he
hoped
it
would
not
harm
them
if
taken
in
minute
quantities
accustomed
now
to
implicitly
accept
his
advice
she
fought
and
steadily
conquered
the
craving
within
her
oddly
enough
the
thawing
of
their
scorched
bodies
beneath
the
tarpaulin
brought
a
certain
degree
of
relief
they
were
supremely
uncomfortable
but
that
was
as
naught
compared
with
the
relaxation
from
the
torments
previously
borne
for
a
long
time
the
best
part
of
an
hour
perhaps
they
remained
silent
the
sailor
was
reviewing
the
pros
and
cons
of
their
precarious
condition
it
would
of
course
be
a
matter
of
supreme
importance
were
the
indian
to
be
faithful
to
his
promise
here
the
prospect
was
decidedly
hopeful
the
man
was
an
old
and
the
of
native
cavalry
knew
how
enduring
was
the
attachment
of
this
poor
convict
to
home
and
military
service
probably
at
that
moment
the
mahommedan
was
praying
to
the
prophet
and
his
two
nephews
to
aid
him
in
rescuing
the
sahib
and
the
woman
whom
the
sahib
held
so
dear
for
the
and
sirkar
is
very
merciful
to
offending
natives
who
thus
condone
their
former
crimes
but
howsoever
willing
he
might
be
what
could
one
man
do
among
so
many
the
dyaks
were
hostile
to
him
in
race
and
creed
and
assuredly
infuriated
against
the
foreign
devil
who
had
killed
or
wounded
in
round
numbers
of
their
total
force
very
likely
the
hapless
mussulman
would
lose
his
life
that
night
in
attempting
to
bring
water
to
the
foot
of
the
rock
well
he
jenks
might
have
something
to
say
in
that
regard
by
midnight
the
moon
would
illumine
nearly
the
whole
of
prospect
park
if
the
mahommedan
were
slain
in
front
of
the
cavern
his
soul
would
travel
to
the
next
world
attended
by
a
nizam
cohort
of
slaughtered
slaves
even
if
the
man
succeeded
in
eluding
the
vigilance
of
his
present
associates
where
was
the
water
to
come
from
there
was
none
on
the
island
save
that
in
the
well
in
all
likelihood
the
dyaks
had
a
store
in
the
remaining
sampans
but
the
native
ally
of
the
beleaguered
pair
would
have
a
task
of
exceeding
difficulty
in
obtaining
one
of
the
jars
or
skins
containing
it
again
granting
all
things
went
well
that
night
what
would
be
the
final
outcome
of
the
struggle
how
long
could
iris
withstand
the
exposure
the
strain
the
misery
of
the
rock
the
future
was
blurred
crowded
with
ugly
and
affrighting
fiends
passing
in
fantastic
array
before
his
vision
and
mouthing
dumb
threats
of
madness
and
death
he
shook
restlessly
not
aware
that
the
girl
sorrowful
glance
luminous
with
love
and
pain
was
fixed
upon
him
summarily
dismissing
these
grisly
phantoms
of
the
mind
he
asked
himself
what
the
mahommedan
exactly
meant
by
warning
him
against
the
trees
on
the
right
and
the
silent
death
that
might
come
from
them
he
was
about
to
crawl
forth
to
the
lip
of
the
rock
and
investigate
matters
in
that
locality
when
iris
who
also
was
busy
with
her
thoughts
restrained
him
wait
a
little
while
she
said
none
of
the
dyaks
will
venture
into
the
open
until
night
falls
and
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
there
was
a
quiet
solemnity
in
her
voice
that
jenks
had
never
heard
before
it
chilled
him
his
heart
acknowledged
a
quick
sense
of
evil
omen
he
raised
himself
slightly
and
turned
towards
her
her
face
beautiful
and
serene
beneath
its
disfigurements
wore
an
expression
of
settled
purpose
for
the
life
of
him
he
dared
not
question
her
that
man
the
interpreter
she
said
told
you
that
if
i
were
given
up
to
the
chief
he
and
his
followers
would
go
away
and
molest
you
no
more
his
forehead
seamed
with
sudden
anger
a
mere
bait
he
protested
in
any
event
it
is
hardly
worth
discussion
and
the
answer
came
clear
and
resolute
i
think
i
will
agree
to
those
terms
at
first
he
regarded
her
with
undisguised
and
wordless
amazement
then
the
appalling
thought
darted
through
his
brain
that
she
contemplated
this
supreme
sacrifice
in
order
to
save
him
a
clammy
sweat
bedewed
his
brow
but
by
sheer
will
power
he
contrived
to
say
you
must
be
mad
to
even
dream
of
such
a
thing
do
you
understand
what
it
means
to
you
and
to
me
it
is
a
ruse
to
trap
us
they
are
ungoverned
savages
once
they
had
you
in
their
power
they
would
laugh
at
a
promise
made
to
me
you
may
be
mistaken
they
must
have
some
sense
of
fair
dealing
even
assuming
that
such
was
their
intention
they
may
depart
from
it
they
have
already
lost
a
great
many
men
their
chief
having
gained
his
main
object
might
not
be
able
to
persuade
them
to
take
further
risks
i
will
make
it
a
part
of
the
bargain
that
they
first
supply
you
with
plenty
of
water
then
you
unaided
could
keep
them
at
bay
for
many
days
we
lose
nothing
we
can
gain
a
great
deal
by
endeavoring
to
pacify
them
iris
he
gasped
what
are
you
saying
the
unexpected
sound
of
her
name
on
his
lips
almost
unnerved
her
but
no
martyr
ever
went
to
the
stake
with
more
settled
purpose
than
this
pure
woman
resolved
to
immolate
herself
for
the
sake
of
the
man
she
loved
he
had
dared
all
for
her
faced
death
in
many
shapes
now
it
was
her
turn
her
eyes
were
lit
with
a
seraphic
fire
her
sweet
face
resigned
as
that
of
an
angel
i
have
thought
it
out
she
murmured
gazing
at
him
steadily
yet
scarce
seeing
him
it
is
worth
trying
as
a
last
expedient
we
are
abandoned
by
all
save
the
lord
and
it
does
not
appear
to
be
his
holy
will
to
help
us
on
earth
we
can
struggle
on
here
until
we
die
is
that
right
when
one
of
us
may
live
her
very
candor
had
betrayed
her
she
would
go
away
with
these
monstrous
captors
endure
them
even
flatter
them
until
she
and
they
were
far
removed
from
the
island
and
then
she
would
kill
herself
in
her
innocence
she
imagined
that
under
such
circumstances
was
a
pardonable
offence
she
only
gave
a
life
to
save
a
life
and
greater
love
than
this
is
not
known
to
god
or
man
the
sailor
in
a
tempest
of
wrath
and
wild
emotion
had
it
in
his
mind
to
compel
her
into
reason
to
shake
her
as
one
shakes
a
wayward
child
he
rose
to
his
knees
with
this
notion
in
his
fevered
brain
then
he
looked
at
her
and
a
mist
seemed
to
shut
her
out
from
his
sight
was
she
lost
to
him
already
was
all
that
had
gone
before
an
idle
dream
of
joy
and
grief
a
wizard
glimpse
of
mirrored
happiness
and
vague
perils
was
iris
the
thrown
to
him
by
the
waves
to
be
snatched
away
by
some
irresistible
and
malign
influence
in
the
mere
physical
effort
to
assure
himself
that
she
was
still
near
to
him
he
gathered
her
up
in
his
strong
hands
yes
she
was
there
breathing
wondering
palpitating
he
folded
her
closely
to
his
breast
and
yielding
to
the
passionate
longings
of
his
tired
heart
whispered
to
her
my
darling
do
you
think
i
can
survive
your
loss
you
are
life
itself
to
me
if
we
have
to
die
sweet
one
let
us
die
together
then
iris
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
i
am
quite
quite
happy
now
she
sobbed
brokenly
i
did
imagine
it
would
come
this
way
but
i
am
thankful
it
has
come
illustration
love
tremendous
in
its
power
unfathomable
in
its
mystery
had
cast
its
spell
over
them
for
a
little
while
they
yielded
to
the
glamour
of
the
divine
knowledge
that
amidst
the
chaos
of
eternity
each
soul
had
found
its
mate
there
was
no
need
for
words
love
tremendous
in
its
power
unfathomable
in
its
mystery
had
cast
its
spell
over
them
they
were
garbed
in
light
throned
in
a
palace
built
by
fairy
hands
on
all
sides
squatted
the
ghouls
of
privation
misery
danger
even
grim
death
but
they
heeded
not
the
inferno
they
had
created
a
paradise
in
an
earthly
hell
then
iris
withdrew
herself
from
the
man
embrace
she
was
delightfully
shy
and
timid
now
so
you
really
do
love
me
she
whispered
with
shining
eyes
and
parted
lips
he
drew
her
to
him
again
and
kissed
her
tenderly
for
he
had
cast
all
doubt
to
the
winds
no
matter
what
the
future
had
in
store
she
was
his
his
only
it
was
not
in
man
power
to
part
them
a
glorious
effulgence
dazzled
his
brain
her
love
had
given
him
the
strength
of
goliath
the
confidence
of
david
he
would
pluck
her
from
the
perils
that
environed
her
the
dyak
was
not
yet
born
who
should
rend
her
from
him
he
fondled
her
hair
and
gently
rubbed
her
cheek
with
his
rough
fingers
the
sudden
sense
of
ownership
of
this
fair
woman
was
entrancing
it
almost
bewildered
him
to
find
iris
nestling
close
clinging
to
him
in
utter
confidence
and
trust
but
i
knew
i
knew
she
murmured
you
betrayed
yourself
so
many
times
you
wrote
your
secret
to
me
and
though
you
did
not
tell
me
i
found
your
dear
words
on
the
sands
and
have
treasured
them
next
my
heart
what
girlish
romance
was
this
he
held
her
away
gingerly
just
so
far
that
he
could
look
into
her
eyes
oh
it
is
true
quite
true
she
cried
drawing
the
locket
from
her
neck
do
you
recognize
your
own
handwriting
or
were
you
not
certain
just
then
that
you
really
did
love
me
dear
dear
how
often
would
she
repeat
that
wondrous
phrase
together
they
bent
over
the
tiny
slips
of
paper
there
it
was
again
i
love
you
twice
blazoned
in
magic
symbols
with
blushing
eagerness
she
told
him
how
by
mere
accident
of
course
she
caught
sight
of
her
own
name
it
was
not
very
wrong
was
it
to
pick
up
that
tiny
scrap
or
those
others
which
she
could
not
help
seeing
and
which
unfolded
their
simple
tale
so
truthfully
wrong
it
was
so
delightfully
right
that
he
must
kiss
her
again
to
emphasize
his
convictions
all
this
fondling
and
had
of
course
an
air
of
grotesque
absurdity
because
indulged
in
by
two
grimy
and
tattered
individuals
crouching
beneath
a
tarpaulin
on
a
rocky
ledge
and
surrounded
by
bloodthirsty
savages
intent
on
their
destruction
such
incidents
require
the
setting
of
convention
the
conservatory
with
its
wealth
of
flowers
and
plants
a
summer
wood
a
chippendale
and
yet
god
wot
men
and
women
have
loved
each
other
in
this
grey
old
world
without
stopping
to
consider
the
appropriateness
of
place
and
season
after
a
delicious
pause
iris
began
again
robert
i
must
call
you
robert
now
there
there
please
let
me
get
a
word
in
even
edgeways
well
then
robert
dear
i
do
not
care
much
what
happens
now
i
suppose
it
was
very
wicked
and
foolish
of
me
to
speak
as
i
did
before
before
you
called
me
iris
now
tell
me
at
once
why
did
you
call
me
iris
you
must
propound
that
riddle
to
your
godfather
no
wriggling
please
why
did
you
do
it
because
i
could
not
help
myself
it
slid
out
unawares
how
long
have
you
thought
of
me
only
as
iris
your
iris
ever
since
i
first
understood
that
somewhere
in
the
wide
world
was
a
dear
woman
to
love
me
and
be
loved
but
at
one
time
you
thought
her
name
was
elizabeth
a
delusion
a
mirage
that
is
why
those
who
christened
you
had
the
wisdom
of
the
gods
another
interlude
they
grew
calmer
more
sedate
it
was
so
undeniably
true
they
loved
one
another
that
the
fact
was
becoming
venerable
with
age
iris
was
perhaps
the
first
to
recognize
its
quiet
certainty
as
i
can
not
get
you
to
talk
reasonably
she
protested
i
must
appeal
to
your
sympathy
i
am
hungry
and
oh
so
thirsty
the
girl
had
hardly
eaten
a
morsel
for
her
midday
meal
then
she
was
despondent
utterly
now
she
was
filled
with
new
hope
there
was
a
fresh
motive
in
existence
whether
destined
to
live
an
hour
or
half
a
century
she
would
never
never
leave
him
nor
of
course
could
he
ever
ever
leave
her
some
things
were
quite
impossible
for
example
that
they
should
part
jenks
brought
her
a
biscuit
a
tin
of
meat
and
that
most
doleful
cup
of
champagne
it
is
not
exactly
he
said
handing
her
the
insipid
beverage
but
under
other
conditions
it
is
a
wine
almost
worthy
to
toast
you
in
she
fancied
she
had
never
before
noticed
what
a
charming
smile
he
had
is
a
peculiarly
suitable
word
she
cried
i
am
simply
frizzling
in
these
warm
clothes
she
stopped
for
the
first
time
since
that
prehistoric
period
when
she
was
miss
deane
and
he
jenks
she
remembered
the
manner
of
her
garments
it
is
not
the
warm
clothing
you
feel
so
much
as
the
want
of
air
explained
the
sailor
readily
this
tarpaulin
has
made
the
place
very
stuffy
but
we
must
put
up
with
it
until
sundown
by
the
way
what
is
that
a
light
tap
on
the
tarred
canvas
directly
over
his
head
had
caught
his
ear
iris
glad
of
the
diversion
told
him
she
had
heard
the
noise
three
or
four
times
but
fancied
it
was
caused
by
the
occasional
rustling
of
the
sheet
on
the
uprights
jenks
had
not
allowed
his
attention
to
wander
altogether
from
external
events
since
the
dyaks
last
escapade
there
was
no
sign
of
them
in
the
valley
or
on
either
beach
not
for
trivial
cause
would
they
come
again
within
range
of
the
they
waited
and
listened
silently
another
tap
sounded
on
the
tarpaulin
in
a
different
place
and
they
both
concurred
in
the
belief
that
something
had
darted
in
curved
flight
over
the
ledge
and
fallen
on
top
of
their
protecting
shield
let
us
see
what
the
game
is
exclaimed
the
sailor
he
crept
to
the
back
of
the
ledge
and
drew
himself
up
until
he
could
reach
over
the
sheet
he
returned
carrying
in
his
hand
a
couple
of
tiny
arrows
there
are
no
less
than
seven
of
these
things
sticking
in
the
canvas
he
said
they
do
look
very
terrible
i
suppose
that
is
what
my
indian
friend
meant
by
warning
me
against
the
trees
on
the
right
he
did
not
tell
iris
all
the
mahommedan
said
there
was
no
need
to
alarm
her
causelessly
even
whilst
they
examined
the
curious
little
missile
another
flew
up
from
the
valley
and
lodged
on
the
roof
of
their
shelter
the
shaft
of
the
arrow
made
of
some
extremely
hard
wood
was
about
ten
inches
in
length
affixed
to
it
was
a
pointed
sharp
but
not
barbed
and
not
fastened
in
a
manner
suggestive
of
much
strength
the
arrow
was
neither
feathered
nor
grooved
for
a
bowstring
altogether
it
seemed
to
be
a
childish
weapon
to
be
used
by
men
equipped
with
lead
and
steel
jenks
could
not
understand
the
appearance
of
this
toy
evidently
the
dyaks
believed
in
its
efficacy
or
they
would
not
keep
on
pertinaciously
dropping
an
arrow
on
the
ledge
how
do
they
fire
it
asked
iris
do
they
throw
it
i
will
soon
tell
you
he
replied
reaching
for
a
rifle
do
not
go
out
yet
she
entreated
him
they
can
not
harm
us
perhaps
we
may
learn
more
by
keeping
quiet
they
will
not
continue
shooting
these
things
all
day
again
a
tiny
arrow
traveled
towards
them
in
a
graceful
parabola
this
one
fell
short
missing
the
tarpaulin
it
almost
dropped
on
the
outstretched
hand
she
picked
it
up
the
point
had
snapped
by
contact
with
the
floor
of
the
ledge
she
sought
for
and
found
the
small
tip
see
she
said
it
seems
to
have
been
dipped
in
something
it
is
quite
discolored
jenks
frowned
peculiarly
a
startling
explanation
had
suggested
itself
to
him
fragments
of
forgotten
lore
were
taking
cohesion
in
his
mind
put
it
down
quick
he
cried
iris
obeyed
him
with
wonder
in
her
eyes
he
spilled
a
teasponful
of
champagne
into
a
small
hollow
of
the
rock
and
steeped
one
of
the
in
the
liquid
within
a
few
seconds
the
champagne
assumed
a
greenish
tinge
and
the
bone
became
white
then
he
knew
good
heavens
he
exclaimed
these
are
poisoned
arrows
shot
through
a
blowpipe
i
have
never
before
seen
one
but
i
have
often
read
about
them
the
bamboos
the
dyaks
carried
were
sumpitans
these
have
been
steeped
in
the
juice
of
the
upas
tree
iris
my
dear
girl
if
one
of
them
had
so
much
as
scratched
your
finger
nothing
on
earth
could
save
you
she
paled
and
drew
back
in
sudden
horror
this
tiny
thing
had
taken
the
semblance
of
a
snake
a
vicious
cobra
cast
at
her
feet
would
be
less
alarming
for
the
reptile
could
be
killed
whilst
his
venomous
fangs
would
only
be
used
in
another
tap
sounded
on
their
covering
evidently
the
dyaks
would
persist
in
their
efforts
to
get
one
of
those
poisoned
darts
home
jenks
debated
silently
whether
it
would
be
better
to
create
a
commotion
thus
inducing
the
savages
to
believe
they
had
succeeded
in
inflicting
a
mortal
wound
or
to
wait
until
the
next
arrow
fell
rush
out
and
try
conclusions
with
bullets
against
the
sumpitan
blowers
he
decided
in
favor
of
the
latter
course
he
wished
to
dishearten
his
assailants
to
cram
down
their
throats
the
belief
that
he
was
invulnerable
and
could
visit
their
every
effort
with
a
deadly
reprisal
iris
of
course
protested
when
he
explained
his
project
but
the
fighting
spirit
prevailed
their
love
idyll
must
yield
to
the
needs
of
the
hour
he
had
not
long
to
wait
the
last
arrow
fell
and
he
sprang
to
the
extreme
right
of
the
ledge
first
he
looked
through
that
invaluable
screen
of
grass
three
dyaks
were
on
the
ground
and
a
fourth
in
the
fork
of
a
tree
they
were
each
armed
with
a
blowpipe
he
in
the
tree
was
just
fitting
an
arrow
into
the
bamboo
tube
the
others
were
watching
him
jenks
raised
his
rifle
fired
and
the
warrior
in
the
tree
pitched
headlong
to
the
ground
a
second
shot
stretched
a
companion
on
top
of
him
one
man
jumped
into
the
bushes
and
got
away
but
the
fourth
tripped
over
his
unwieldy
sumpitan
and
a
bullet
tore
a
large
section
from
his
skull
the
sailor
then
amused
himself
with
breaking
the
bamboos
by
firing
at
them
he
came
back
to
the
girl
i
fancy
that
further
practice
with
blowpipes
will
be
at
a
discount
on
rainbow
island
he
cried
cheerfully
but
iris
was
anxious
and
distrait
it
is
very
sad
she
said
that
we
are
obliged
to
secure
our
own
safety
by
the
ceaseless
slaughter
of
human
beings
is
there
no
offer
we
can
make
them
no
promise
of
future
gain
to
tempt
them
to
abandon
hostilities
none
whatever
these
borneo
dyaks
are
bred
from
infancy
to
prey
on
their
to
be
strangers
and
defenceless
is
to
court
pillage
and
massacre
at
their
hands
i
think
no
more
of
shooting
them
than
of
smashing
a
clay
pigeon
killing
a
mad
dog
is
perhaps
a
better
simile
but
robert
dear
how
long
can
we
hold
out
what
are
you
growing
tired
of
me
already
he
hoped
to
divert
her
thoughts
from
this
constantly
recurring
topic
twice
within
the
hour
had
it
been
broached
and
dismissed
but
iris
would
not
permit
him
to
shirk
it
again
she
made
no
reply
simply
regarding
him
with
a
wistful
smile
so
jenks
sat
down
by
her
side
and
rehearsed
the
hopes
and
fears
which
perplexed
him
he
determined
that
there
should
be
no
further
concealment
between
them
if
they
failed
to
secure
water
that
night
if
the
dyaks
maintained
a
strict
siege
of
the
rock
throughout
the
whole
of
next
day
well
they
might
survive
it
was
problematical
best
leave
matters
in
god
hands
with
feminine
persistency
she
clung
to
the
subject
detecting
his
unwillingness
to
discuss
a
possible
final
stage
in
their
sufferings
robert
she
whispered
fearfully
you
will
never
let
me
fall
into
the
power
of
the
chief
will
you
not
whilst
i
live
you
live
do
you
understand
i
would
go
with
them
to
save
you
but
i
would
have
died
by
my
own
hand
robert
my
love
you
must
do
this
thing
before
the
end
i
must
be
the
first
to
die
he
hung
his
head
in
a
paroxysm
of
silent
despair
her
words
rung
like
a
tocsin
of
the
bright
romance
conjured
up
by
the
avowal
of
their
love
it
seemed
to
him
in
that
instant
they
had
no
separate
existence
as
distinguished
from
the
great
stream
of
human
life
the
turbulent
river
that
flowed
unceasingly
from
an
eternity
of
the
past
to
an
eternity
of
the
future
for
a
day
a
year
a
decade
two
frail
bubbles
danced
on
the
surface
and
raced
joyously
together
in
the
sunshine
then
they
were
broken
did
it
matter
how
by
savage
sword
or
lingering
ailment
they
vanished
absorbed
again
by
the
rushing
waters
and
other
bubbles
rose
in
precarious
iridescence
it
was
a
fatalist
view
of
life
a
dim
and
obscurantist
groping
after
truth
induced
by
the
overpowering
nature
of
present
difficulties
the
famous
tentmaker
of
naishapur
blindly
sought
the
unending
purpose
when
he
wrote
up
from
earth
centre
through
the
seventh
gate
i
rose
and
on
the
throne
of
saturn
sate
and
many
a
knot
unravel
by
the
road
but
not
the
of
human
fate
there
was
the
door
to
which
i
found
no
key
there
was
the
veil
through
which
i
could
not
see
some
little
talk
awhile
of
me
and
thee
there
was
and
then
no
more
of
thee
and
me
the
sailor
too
wrestled
with
the
great
problem
he
may
be
pardoned
if
his
heart
quailed
and
he
groaned
aloud
iris
he
said
solemnly
whatever
happens
unless
i
am
struck
dead
at
your
feet
i
promise
you
that
we
shall
pass
the
boundary
hand
in
hand
be
mine
the
punishment
if
we
have
decided
wrongly
and
now
he
cried
tossing
his
head
in
a
defiant
access
of
energy
let
us
have
done
with
the
morgue
for
my
part
i
refuse
to
acknowledge
i
am
inside
until
the
gates
clang
behind
me
as
for
you
you
can
not
help
yourself
you
must
do
as
i
tell
you
i
never
knew
of
a
case
where
the
question
of
rights
was
so
promptly
settled
his
vitality
was
infectious
iris
smiled
again
her
sensitive
highly
strung
nerves
permitted
these
sharp
alternations
between
despondency
and
hope
you
must
remember
he
went
on
that
the
dyak
score
is
to
the
bad
whilst
our
loss
stands
at
love
dear
me
that
can
not
be
right
love
is
surely
not
a
loss
a
cynic
might
describe
it
as
a
negative
gain
oh
a
cynic
is
no
authority
he
knows
nothing
whatever
about
the
subject
my
father
used
to
say
when
he
was
in
parliament
that
people
who
knew
least
spoke
best
some
men
get
overweighted
with
facts
they
chatted
in
lighter
vein
with
such
pendulum
swing
back
to
nonchalance
that
none
would
have
deemed
it
possible
for
these
two
to
have
already
determined
the
momentous
issue
of
the
pending
struggle
should
it
go
against
them
there
is
glory
be
in
the
race
the
splendid
faculty
of
meeting
death
with
calm
defiance
almost
with
contempt
moments
of
panic
agonizing
memories
of
bygone
days
visions
of
dear
faces
never
to
be
seen
again
may
temporarily
dethrone
this
proud
fortitude
but
the
tremors
pass
the
gibbering
specters
of
fear
and
lamentation
are
thrust
aside
and
the
sons
and
daughters
of
great
britain
answer
the
last
with
undaunted
heroism
they
know
how
to
die
and
so
the
sun
sank
to
rest
in
the
sea
and
the
star
pierced
the
deepening
blue
of
the
celestial
arch
whilst
the
man
and
the
woman
awaited
patiently
the
verdict
of
the
fates
before
the
light
failed
jenks
gathered
all
the
poisoned
arrows
and
ground
their
vemoned
points
to
powder
beneath
his
heel
gladly
would
iris
and
he
have
dispensed
with
the
friendly
protection
of
the
tarpaulin
when
the
cool
evening
breeze
came
from
the
south
but
such
a
thing
might
not
be
even
considered
several
hours
of
darkness
must
elapse
before
the
moon
rose
and
during
that
period
were
their
foes
so
minded
they
would
be
absolutely
at
the
mercy
of
the
sumpitan
shafts
if
not
covered
by
their
impenetrable
buckler
the
sailor
looked
long
and
earnestly
at
the
well
their
own
bucket
improvised
out
of
a
and
a
rope
lay
close
to
the
brink
a
stealthy
crawl
across
the
sandy
valley
half
a
minute
of
grave
danger
and
he
would
be
up
the
ladder
again
with
enough
water
to
serve
their
imperative
needs
for
days
to
come
there
was
little
or
no
risk
in
descending
the
rock
soon
after
sunset
it
was
wrapped
in
deepest
gloom
for
night
succeeds
day
in
the
tropics
with
wondrous
speed
the
hazard
lay
in
twice
crossing
the
white
sand
were
any
of
the
dyaks
hiding
behind
the
house
or
among
the
trees
he
held
no
foolhardy
view
of
his
own
powers
the
nature
of
the
conflict
thus
far
was
due
solely
to
his
possession
of
as
opposed
to
let
him
be
surrounded
on
the
level
at
close
quarters
by
a
dozen
determined
men
and
he
must
surely
succumb
were
it
not
for
the
presence
of
iris
he
would
have
given
no
second
thought
to
the
peril
it
was
just
one
of
those
undertakings
which
a
soldier
jumps
at
here
goes
for
the
or
kingdom
come
is
the
pithy
philosophy
of
thomas
atkins
under
such
circumstances
now
there
was
no
but
there
was
iris
to
act
without
consulting
her
was
impossible
so
they
discussed
the
project
naturally
she
scouted
it
the
mahommedan
may
be
able
to
help
us
she
pointed
out
in
any
event
let
us
wait
until
the
moon
wanes
that
is
the
darkest
hour
we
do
not
know
what
may
happen
meanwhile
the
words
had
hardly
left
her
mouth
when
an
irregular
volley
was
fired
at
them
from
the
right
flank
of
the
enemy
position
every
bullet
struck
yards
above
their
heads
the
common
failing
of
musketry
at
night
being
to
take
too
high
an
aim
but
the
impact
of
the
missiles
on
a
rock
so
highly
impregnated
with
minerals
caused
sparks
to
fly
and
jenks
saw
that
the
dyaks
would
obtain
by
this
means
a
most
dangerous
index
of
their
faulty
practice
telling
iris
to
at
once
occupy
her
safe
corner
he
rapidly
adjusted
a
rifle
on
the
wooden
rests
already
prepared
in
anticipation
of
an
attack
from
that
quarter
and
fired
three
shots
at
the
opposing
crest
whence
came
the
majority
of
one
at
least
of
the
three
found
a
human
billet
there
was
a
shout
of
surprise
and
pain
and
the
next
volley
spurted
from
the
ground
level
this
could
do
no
damage
owing
to
the
angle
but
he
endeavored
to
disconcert
the
marksmen
by
keeping
up
a
steady
fire
in
their
direction
he
did
not
dream
of
attaining
other
than
a
moral
effect
as
there
is
a
lot
of
room
to
miss
when
aiming
in
the
dark
soon
he
imagined
that
the
burst
of
flame
from
his
rifle
helped
the
dyaks
because
several
bullets
whizzed
close
to
his
head
and
about
this
time
firing
recommenced
from
the
crest
notwithstanding
all
his
skill
and
manipulation
of
the
wooden
supports
he
failed
to
dislodge
the
occupants
every
minute
one
or
more
ounces
of
lead
pitched
right
into
the
ledge
damaging
the
stores
and
tearing
the
tarpaulin
whilst
those
which
struck
the
wall
of
rock
were
dangerous
to
iris
by
reason
of
the
molten
spray
he
could
guess
what
had
happened
by
lying
flat
on
the
sloping
plateau
or
squeezing
close
to
the
projecting
shoulder
of
the
cliff
the
dyaks
were
so
little
exposed
that
idle
chance
alone
would
enable
him
to
hit
one
of
them
but
they
must
be
shifted
or
this
night
bombardment
would
prove
the
most
serious
development
yet
encountered
are
you
all
right
iris
he
called
out
yes
dear
she
answered
well
i
want
you
to
keep
yourself
covered
by
the
canvas
for
a
little
while
especially
your
head
and
shoulders
i
am
going
to
stop
these
chaps
they
have
found
our
weak
point
but
i
can
baffle
them
she
did
not
ask
what
he
proposed
to
do
he
heard
the
rustling
of
the
tarpaulin
as
she
pulled
it
instantly
he
cast
loose
the
and
armed
only
with
a
revolver
dropped
down
the
rock
he
was
quite
invisible
to
the
enemy
on
reaching
the
ground
he
listened
for
a
moment
there
was
no
sound
save
the
occasional
reports
ninety
yards
away
he
hitched
up
the
lower
rungs
of
the
ladder
until
they
were
six
feet
from
the
level
and
then
crept
noiselessly
close
to
the
rock
for
some
forty
yards
he
halted
beside
a
small
and
stooped
to
find
something
embedded
near
its
roots
at
this
distance
he
could
plainly
hear
the
muttered
conversation
of
the
dyaks
and
could
see
several
of
them
prone
on
the
sand
the
latter
fact
proved
how
fatal
would
be
an
attempt
on
his
part
to
reach
the
well
they
must
discover
him
instantly
once
he
quitted
the
somber
shadows
of
the
cliff
he
waited
perhaps
a
few
seconds
longer
than
was
necessary
endeavoring
to
pierce
the
dim
atmosphere
and
learn
something
of
their
disposition
a
vigorous
outburst
of
firing
sent
him
back
with
haste
iris
was
up
there
alone
he
knew
not
what
might
happen
he
was
now
feverishly
anxious
to
be
with
her
again
to
hear
her
voice
and
be
sure
that
all
was
well
to
his
horror
he
found
the
ladder
swaying
gently
against
the
rock
some
one
was
using
it
he
sprang
forward
careless
of
consequence
and
seized
the
swinging
end
which
had
fallen
free
again
he
had
his
foot
on
the
bottom
rung
when
iris
voice
close
at
hand
and
shrill
with
terror
shrieked
robert
where
are
you
here
he
shouted
the
next
instant
she
dropped
into
his
arms
a
startled
exclamation
from
the
vicinity
of
the
house
and
some
loud
cries
from
the
more
distant
dyaks
on
the
other
side
of
prospect
park
showed
that
they
had
been
overheard
up
he
whispered
hold
tight
and
go
as
quickly
as
you
can
not
without
you
up
for
god
sake
i
follow
at
your
heels
she
began
to
climb
he
took
some
article
from
between
his
teeth
a
string
apparently
and
drew
it
towards
him
mounting
the
ladder
at
the
same
time
the
end
tightened
he
was
then
about
ten
feet
from
the
ground
two
dyaks
yelling
fiercely
rushed
from
the
cover
of
the
house
go
on
he
said
to
iris
do
lose
your
nerve
whatever
happens
i
am
close
behind
you
i
am
quite
safe
she
gasped
turning
and
clinging
on
with
one
hand
he
drew
his
revolver
and
fired
at
the
pair
beneath
who
could
now
faintly
discern
them
and
were
almost
within
reach
of
the
ladder
the
shooting
made
them
halt
he
did
not
know
or
care
if
they
were
hit
to
frighten
them
was
sufficient
several
others
were
running
across
the
sands
to
the
cave
attracted
by
the
noise
and
the
cries
of
the
foremost
pursuers
then
he
gave
a
steady
pull
to
the
cord
the
sharp
crack
of
a
rifle
came
from
the
vicinity
of
the
old
quarry
he
saw
the
flash
among
the
trees
almost
simultaneously
a
bright
light
leapt
from
the
opposite
ledge
illumining
the
vicinity
like
a
meteor
it
lit
up
the
rock
showed
iris
just
vanishing
into
the
safety
of
the
ledge
and
revealed
jenks
and
the
dyaks
to
each
other
there
followed
instantly
a
tremendous
explosion
that
shook
earth
and
air
dislodging
every
loose
stone
in
the
pile
of
rocks
hurling
from
the
plateau
some
of
its
occupants
and
wounding
the
remainder
with
a
shower
of
lead
and
débris
the
island
birds
long
since
driven
to
the
remote
trees
clamored
in
raucous
peal
and
from
the
dyaks
came
yells
of
fright
or
anguish
the
sailor
unmolested
further
reached
the
ledge
to
find
iris
prostrate
where
she
had
fallen
dead
or
unconscious
he
knew
not
which
he
felt
his
face
become
grey
in
the
darkness
with
a
fierce
tug
he
hauled
the
ladder
well
away
from
the
ground
and
sank
to
his
knees
beside
her
he
took
her
into
his
arms
there
was
no
light
he
could
not
see
her
eyes
or
lips
her
slight
breathing
seemed
to
indicate
a
fainting
fit
but
there
was
no
water
nor
was
it
possible
to
adopt
any
of
the
ordinary
expedients
suited
to
such
a
seizure
he
could
only
wait
in
a
dreadful
silence
wait
clasping
her
to
his
breast
and
dumbly
wonder
what
other
loss
he
could
suffer
ere
the
final
release
came
at
last
she
sighed
deeply
a
strong
tremor
of
returning
life
stirred
her
frame
thank
god
he
murmured
and
bowed
his
head
were
the
sun
shining
he
could
not
see
her
now
for
his
eyes
were
blurred
robert
she
whispered
yes
darling
are
you
safe
safe
my
loved
one
think
of
yourself
what
has
happened
to
you
i
fainted
i
think
i
have
no
hurt
i
missed
you
something
told
me
you
had
gone
i
went
to
help
you
or
die
with
you
and
then
that
noise
and
the
light
what
did
you
do
he
silenced
her
questioning
with
a
passionate
kiss
he
carried
her
to
a
little
nook
and
fumbled
among
the
stores
until
he
found
a
bottle
of
brandy
she
drank
some
under
its
revivifying
influence
she
was
soon
able
to
listen
to
the
explanation
he
offered
after
securing
the
ladder
in
a
tall
tree
near
the
valley
of
death
he
had
tightly
fixed
a
loaded
rifle
which
pointed
at
a
loose
stone
in
the
rock
overhanging
the
ledge
held
by
the
dyaks
this
stone
rested
against
a
number
of
percussion
caps
extracted
from
cartridges
and
these
were
in
direct
communication
with
a
train
of
powder
leading
to
a
blasting
charge
placed
at
the
end
of
a
inch
hole
drilled
with
a
crowbar
the
impact
of
the
bullet
against
the
stone
could
not
fail
to
explode
some
of
the
caps
he
had
used
the
contents
of
three
hundred
cartridges
to
secure
a
sufficiency
of
powder
and
the
bullets
were
all
crammed
into
the
orifice
being
tamped
with
clay
and
wet
sand
the
rifle
was
fired
by
means
of
the
string
the
loose
coils
of
which
were
secreted
at
the
foot
of
the
poon
by
springing
this
novel
mine
he
had
effectually
removed
every
dyak
from
the
ledge
over
which
its
contents
would
spread
like
a
fan
further
it
would
probably
deter
the
survivors
from
again
venturing
near
that
fatal
spot
iris
listened
only
half
comprehending
her
mind
was
filled
with
one
thought
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
robert
had
left
her
had
done
this
thing
without
telling
her
she
forgave
him
knowing
he
acted
for
the
best
but
he
must
never
never
deceive
her
again
in
such
a
manner
she
could
not
bear
it
what
better
excuse
could
man
desire
for
caressing
her
yea
even
squeezing
her
until
the
sobs
ceased
and
she
protested
with
a
weak
little
laugh
robert
i
have
got
much
breath
after
that
excitement
but
please
leave
me
the
remains
chapter
xiv
the
unexpected
happens
you
are
a
dear
unreasonable
little
girl
he
said
have
you
breath
enough
to
tell
me
why
you
came
down
the
ladder
when
i
discovered
you
were
gone
i
became
wild
with
fright
do
you
see
i
imagined
you
were
wounded
and
had
fallen
from
the
ledge
what
else
could
i
do
but
follow
either
to
help
you
or
if
that
were
not
possible
he
found
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
i
humbly
crave
your
pardon
he
said
that
explanation
is
more
than
ample
it
was
i
who
behaved
unreasonably
of
course
i
should
have
warned
you
yet
sweetheart
i
ran
no
risk
the
real
danger
passed
a
week
ago
how
can
that
be
i
might
have
been
blown
to
pieces
whilst
adjusting
the
heavy
stone
in
front
of
the
caps
i
assure
you
i
was
glad
to
leave
the
place
that
day
with
a
whole
skin
if
the
stone
had
wobbled
or
slipped
well
it
was
a
case
of
determined
may
i
ask
how
many
more
wild
adventures
you
undertook
without
my
knowledge
one
other
of
great
magnitude
i
fell
in
love
with
you
nonsense
she
retorted
i
knew
that
long
before
you
admitted
it
to
yourself
date
please
well
to
begin
at
the
very
beginning
you
thought
i
was
nice
on
board
the
now
did
you
and
they
were
safely
embarked
on
a
conversation
of
no
interest
to
any
other
person
in
the
wide
world
but
which
provided
them
with
the
most
delightful
topic
imaginable
thus
the
time
sped
until
the
rising
moon
silhouetted
the
cliff
on
the
white
carpet
of
sand
the
black
traveled
slowly
closer
to
the
base
of
the
cliff
and
jenks
guided
also
by
the
stars
told
iris
that
midnight
was
at
hand
they
knelt
on
the
parapet
of
the
ledge
alert
to
catch
any
unusual
sound
and
watching
for
any
indication
of
human
movement
but
rainbow
island
was
now
still
as
the
grave
the
wounded
dyaks
had
seemingly
been
removed
from
hut
and
beach
the
dead
lay
where
they
had
fallen
the
sea
sang
a
lullaby
to
the
reef
and
the
fresh
breeze
whispered
among
the
palm
fronds
that
was
all
perhaps
they
have
gone
murmured
iris
the
sailor
put
his
arm
round
her
neck
and
gently
pressed
her
lips
together
anything
would
serve
as
an
excuse
for
that
sort
of
thing
but
he
really
did
want
absolute
silence
at
that
moment
if
the
mussulman
kept
his
compact
the
hour
was
at
hand
an
intruder
disturbed
the
quietude
of
the
scene
their
old
acquaintance
the
singing
beetle
chortled
his
loud
way
across
the
park
iris
was
dying
as
women
say
to
remind
jenks
of
their
first
meeting
with
that
blatant
insect
but
further
talk
was
impossible
there
was
too
much
at
stake
water
they
must
have
then
the
light
hiss
of
a
snake
rose
to
them
from
the
depths
that
is
a
sound
never
forgotten
when
once
heard
it
is
like
unto
no
other
indeed
the
term
hiss
is
a
misnomer
for
the
quick
sibilant
expulsion
of
the
breath
by
an
alarmed
or
angered
serpent
iris
paid
no
heed
to
it
but
jenks
who
knew
there
was
not
a
reptile
of
the
snake
variety
on
the
island
leaned
over
the
ledge
and
emitted
a
tolerably
good
imitation
the
native
was
beneath
probably
the
flight
of
the
beetle

helped
his
noiseless
approach

the

started
at
the
unexpected
call
from
the
depths

quietly
a
rope

the

lowered

communed
jenks
he
hauled
steadily
at
a
heavy
weight
a
goatskin
filled
with
cold
water
he
emptied
the
hot
and
sour
wine
out
of
the
tin
cup
and
was
about
to
hand
the
draught
to
iris
when
a
suspicious
thought
caused
him
to
withhold
it
let
me
taste
first
he
said
the
indian
might
have
betrayed
them
to
the
dyaks
more
unlikely
things
had
happened
what
if
the
water
were
poisoned
or
drugged
he
placed
the
tin
to
his
lips
the
liquid
was
musty
having
been
in
the
skin
nearly
two
days
otherwise
it
seemed
to
be
all
right
with
a
sigh
of
profound
relief
he
gave
iris
the
cup
and
smiled
at
the
most
unladylike
haste
with
which
she
emptied
it

yourself
and
give
me
some
more

said

now
do
not
fret

explained

she
only
stipulated
that
he
should
not
leave
the

whilst
she
would
remain

the

of

carried
his

he
also
picked
up
a
crowbar
a
most
useful
and
silent

then
he
went
quietly

nearing
the

saw

salaamed

and
was

off

fancied
there

descended

the

was
about

stopped
him

he
handed
the

his

i

you
can
use
this

took
it
without

felt
that
the

atoned
for

unworthy
doubts
of
his

the
mahommedan
cautiously
examined
the
back
of

the
neighboring

and
the
open

after
a
brief
absence
he
reported
all
safe
yet

death
and
escaped

escapes
that
you
will

and
tell

the
last
act
of

in

there
was
an
intense
pathos
in
the
man
words
he
made
this
offer
with
an
utter
absence
of
any
motive
save
the
old
tradition
of
duty
to
the

here
was

very
well
then
corporal
mir
jan
late

dare

jenks
was
profoundly
moved
he
reflected
how
best
to
utilize
the
services
of
this
willing
volunteer
without
exposing
him
to
certain
death
in
the
manner
suggested
the

i

you
can
not

said
the

you
are
sure
will
not
come
before

they
have
carried
the
wounded
to
the

and
are
making

such
was
their
talk
when

it

but
i
better
understand
the

i
will
give
you
a

with
plenty
of
ammunition
do
you
go
inside
the
cave
there
and
mir
jan
was
startled
where
the
ghost
is

he
said

that
is
a

for

there
is

i
thought
you
were
never

protested

when
jenks
reached
the
ledge
i
have
been
quite
creepy
i
am
sure
there
is
some
one
down
there
and
please
may
i
have
another
drink
the
sailor
had
left
the
crowbar
beneath
he
secured
a
rifle
a
spare
clip
and
a
dozen
packets
of
cartridges
meanwhile
briefly
explaining
to
iris
the
turn
taken
by
events
so
far
as
mir
jan
was
concerned
she
was
naturally
delighted
and
forgot
her
fears
in
the
excitement
caused
by
the
appearance
of
so
useful
an
ally
she
drank
his
health
in
a
brimming
beaker
of
water
she
heard
her
lover
rejoin
mir
jan
and
saw
the
two
step
out
into
the
moonlight
whilst
jenks
explained
the
action
of
the
fortunately
iris
was
now
much
recovered
from
the
fatigue
and
privation
of
the
earlier
hours
her
senses
were
sharpened
to
a
pitch
little
dreamed
of
by
young
ladies
of
her
age
and
she
deemed
it
her
province
to
act
as
sentry
whilst
the
two
men
conferred
hence
she
was
the
first
to
detect
or
rather
to
become
conscious
of
the
stealthy
crawl
of
several
dyaks
along
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
from
turtle
beach
they
advanced
in
indian
file
moving
with
the
utmost
care
and
crouching
in
the
murky
shadows
like
so
many
wild
beasts
stalking
their
prey
robert
she
screamed
the
dyaks
on
your
left
but
iris
was
rapidly
gaining
some
knowledge
of
strategy
before
she
shrieked
her
warning
she
grasped
a
rifle
holding
it
at
the
ready
about
the
level
of
her
waist
and
depressing
the
muzzle
sufficiently
she
began
firing
down
the
side
of
the
rock
as
fast
as
she
could
handle
lever
and
trigger
two
of
the
nickel
bullets
struck
a
projection
and
splashed
the
leading
savages
with
molten
metal
unfortunately
the
beneath
was
unloaded
being
in
mir
possession
for
purposes
of
instruction
jenks
whipped
out
his
revolver
to
the
cave
he
roared
and
mir
jan
unwillingness
to
face
a
goblin
could
not
withstand
the
combined
impetus
of
the
sahib
order
and
the
onward
rush
of
the
enemy
he
darted
headlong
for
the
entrance
illustration
iris
began
firing
down
the
side
of
the
rock
as
fast
as
she
could
handle
lever
and
trigger
jenks
shooting
blindly
as
he
too
ran
for
the
ladder
emptied
the
revolver
just
as
his
left
hand
clutched
a
rung
three
dyaks
were
so
close
that
it
would
be
folly
to
attempt
to
climb
he
threw
the
weapon
into
the
face
of
the
foremost
man
effectually
stopping
his
onward
progress
for
the
darkness
made
it
impossible
to
dodge
the
missile
the
sailor
turned
to
dive
into
the
cave
and
secure
the
rifle
from
mir
jan
when
his
shin
caught
the
heavy
crowbar
resting
against
the
rock
the
pain
of
the
blow
lent
emphasis
to
the
swing
with
which
the
implement
descended
upon
some
portion
of
a
dyak
anatomy
jenks
never
knew
where
he
hit
the
second
assailant
but
the
place
cracked
like
an
eggshell
he
had
not
time
to
recover
the
bar
for
another
blow
so
he
gave
the
point
in
the
gullet
of
a
gentleman
who
was
about
to
make
a
vicious
sweep
at
him
with
a
parang
the
downfall
of
this
worthy
caused
his
immediate
successor
to
stumble
and
jenks
saw
his
opportunity
with
the
agility
of
a
cat
he
jumped
up
the
ladder
once
started
he
had
to
go
on
he
afterwards
confessed
to
an
unpleasant
sensation
of
pins
and
needles
along
his
back
during
that
brief
acrobatic
display
but
he
reached
the
ledge
without
further
injury
save
an
agonizing
twinge
when
the
unprotected
quick
of
his
damaged
finger
was
smartly
rapped
against
the
rock
these
things
happened
with
the
speed
of
thought
within
forty
seconds
of
iris
shrill
cry
the
sailor
was
breast
high
with
the
ledge
and
calling
to
her
all
right
old
girl
keep
it
up
the
cheerful
confidence
of
his
words
had
a
wonderful
effect
on
her
iris
like
every
good
woman
had
the
maternal
instinct
strong
within
her
the
instinct
that
inspires
alike
the
sister
of
charity
and
the
tigress
fighting
for
her
cubs
when
jenks
was
down
below
there
in
imminent
danger
of
being
cut
to
pieces
the
gentle
lovable
girl
who
would
not
willingly
hurt
the
humblest
of
god
creatures
became
terrible
majestic
in
her
frenzied
purpose
robert
must
be
saved
if
a
maxim
were
planted
on
the
rock
she
would
unhesitatingly
have
turned
the
lever
and
sprayed
the
dyaks
with
bullets
but
here
he
was
close
to
her
unhurt
and
calmly
jubilant
as
was
his
way
when
a
stiff
fight
went
well
he
was
by
her
side
now
firing
and
aiming
too
for
the
dyaks
broke
cover
recklessly
in
running
for
shelter
and
one
may
do
fair
work
by
moonlight
as
many
a
hunter
of
wild
duck
can
testify
by
the
rheumatism
in
his
bones
she
had
strength
enough
left
to
place
the
rifle
out
of
harm
way
before
she
broke
down
and
sobbed
not
tearfully
but
in
a
paroxysm
of
reaction
soon
all
was
quiet
beneath
save
for
the
labored
efforts
of
some
wounded
men
to
get
far
away
from
that
accursed
rock
jenks
was
able
to
turn
to
iris
he
endeavored
to
allay
her
agitation
and
succeeded
somewhat
for
tears
came
and
she
clung
to
him
it
was
useless
to
reproach
him
the
whole
incident
was
unforeseen
she
was
herself
a
party
to
it
but
what
an
escape
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
a
seat
where
the
tarpaulin
rested
on
a
broken
you
have
been
a
very
good
little
girl
and
have
earned
your
supper
he
said
oh
how
can
you
talk
so
callously
after
such
an
awful
experience
she
expostulated
brokenly
the
jesuits
say
their
opponents
teach
that
at
times
a
white
lie
is
permissible
surely
this
was
an
instance
it
is
a
small
thing
to
trouble
about
sweetheart
he
explained
you
spotted
the
enemy
so
promptly
and
blazed
away
with
such
ferocity
that
they
never
got
within
yards
of
me
are
you
sure
i
vow
and
declare
that
after
we
have
eaten
something
and
sampled
our
remaining
bottle
of
wine
i
will
tell
you
exactly
what
happened
why
not
now
because
i
must
first
see
to
mir
jan
i
bundled
him
neck
and
crop
into
the
cave
i
hope
i
did
not
hurt
him
you
are
not
going
down
there
again
no
need
i
trust
he
went
to
the
side
of
the
ledge
recovered
the
ladder
which
he
had
hastily
hauled
out
of
the
dyaks
reach
after
his
climb
and
cried
mir
ah
sahib
praised
be
the
name
of
the
most
high
you
are
alive
i
was
searching
among
the
slain
with
a
sorrowful
heart
the
mahommedan
voice
came
from
some
little
distance
on
the
left
the
slain
you
say
how
many
five
sahib
impossible
i
fired
blindly
with
the
revolver
and
only
hit
one
man
hard
with
the
iron
bar
one
other
dropped
near
the
wood
after
i
obtained
a
rifle
then
there
be
six
sahib
not
reckoning
the
wounded
i
have
accounted
for
one
so
the
must
have
what
is
he
saying
about
me
inquired
iris
who
had
risen
and
joined
her
lover
he
says
you
absolutely
staggered
the
dyaks
by
opening
fire
the
moment
they
appeared
how
did
come
to
slay
one
mir
jan
he
continued
a
son
of
a
black
pig
followed
me
into
the
cave
i
waited
for
him
in
the
darkness
i
have
just
thrown
his
body
outside
footnote
well
done
is
taung
dead
by
any
lucky
chance
no
sahib
if
he
be
not
the
sixth
i
will
go
and
see
you
may
be
attacked
i
have
found
a
sword
sahib
you
left
me
no
cartridges
jenks
told
him
that
the
clip
and
the
twelve
packets
were
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
where
mir
jan
speedily
discovered
them
the
mahommedan
gave
satisfactory
assurance
that
he
understood
the
mechanism
of
the
rifle
by
filling
and
adjusting
the
magazine
then
he
went
to
examine
the
corpse
of
the
man
who
lay
in
the
open
near
the
quarry
path
the
sailor
stood
in
instant
readiness
to
make
a
counter
demonstration
were
the
native
assailed
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
dyaks
mir
jan
returned
with
the
news
that
the
sixth
victim
of
the
brief
yet
fierce
encounter
was
a
renegade
malay
he
was
so
confident
that
the
enemy
had
had
enough
of
it
for
the
night
that
after
recovering
jenks
revolver
he
boldly
went
to
the
well
and
drew
himself
a
supply
of
water
during
supper
a
feast
graced
by
a
quart
of
champagne
worthy
of
the
carlton
jenks
told
iris
so
much
of
the
story
as
was
good
for
her
that
is
to
say
he
cut
down
the
casualty
list
it
was
easy
to
see
what
had
happened
the
dyaks
having
missed
the
mahommedan
and
their
searched
for
him
and
heard
the
conversation
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
knowing
that
their
presence
was
suspected
they
went
back
for
reinforcements
and
returned
by
the
shorter
and
more
advantageous
route
along
turtle
beach
iris
would
have
talked
all
night
but
jenks
made
her
go
to
sleep
by
pillowing
her
head
against
his
shoulder
and
smoothing
her
tangled
tresses
with
his
hand
the
wine
too
was
helpful
in
a
few
minutes
her
voice
became
dreamy
soon
she
was
sleeping
like
a
tired
child
he
managed
to
lay
her
on
a
comfortable
pile
of
ragged
clothing
and
then
resumed
his
vigil
mir
jan
offered
to
mount
guard
beneath
but
jenks
bade
him
go
within
the
cave
and
remain
there
for
the
dawn
would
soon
be
upon
them
left
alone
with
his
thoughts
he
wondered
what
the
rising
sun
would
bring
in
its
train
he
reviewed
the
events
of
the
last
hours
iris
and
he
miss
deane
jenks
to
each
other
were
then
undiscovered
in
their
refuge
the
dyaks
were
gathered
around
a
roaring
fire
in
the
valley
and
mir
jan
was
keen
in
the
hunt
as
the
keenest
among
them
now
iris
was
his
affianced
bride
over
twenty
of
the
enemy
were
killed
and
many
wounded
and
mir
jan
a
devoted
adherent
was
seated
beside
the
skeleton
in
the
gloom
of
the
cavern
what
a
world
it
was
to
be
sure
what
alternations
between
despair
and
hope
what
rebound
from
the
gates
of
death
to
the
threshold
of
eden
how
untrue
after
all
was
the
nebulous
philosophy
of
omar
the
tentmaker
surely
in
the
happenings
of
the
bygone
day
there
was
more
than
the
purposeless
magic
play
in
a
box
whose
candle
is
the
sun
round
which
we
phantom
figures
come
and
go
he
had
indeed
cause
to
be
humbly
thankful
was
there
not
one
who
marked
the
fall
of
a
sparrow
who
clothed
the
lilies
who
knew
the
needs
of
his
creatures
there
in
the
solemn
temple
of
the
night
he
gave
thanks
for
the
protection
vouchsafed
to
iris
and
himself
and
prayed
that
it
might
be
continued
he
deplored
the
useless
bloodshed
the
horror
of
mangled
limbs
and
festering
bodies
that
converted
this
fair
island
into
a
reeking
were
it
possible
by
any
personal
sacrifice
to
divert
the
untutored
savages
from
their
deadly
quest
he
would
gladly
condone
their
misdeeds
and
endeavor
to
assuage
the
torments
of
the
wounded
but
he
was
utterly
helpless
a
pawn
on
that
tiny
chessboard
where
the
game
was
being
played
between
civilization
and
barbarism
the
fight
must
go
on
to
the
bitter
end
he
must
either
vanquish
or
be
vanquished
there
were
other
threads
being
woven
into
the
garment
of
his
life
at
that
moment
but
he
knew
not
of
them
sufficient
for
the
day
was
the
evil
and
the
good
thereof
of
both
he
had
received
full
measure
a
period
of
such
reflection
could
hardly
pass
without
a
speculative
dive
into
the
future
if
iris
and
he
were
rescued
what
would
happen
when
they
went
forth
once
more
into
the
busy
world
not
for
one
instant
did
he
doubt
her
faith
she
was
true
as
steel
knit
to
him
now
by
bonds
of
triple
brass
but
what
would
sir
arthur
deane
think
of
his
daughter
marriage
to
a
discredited
and
cashiered
officer
what
was
it
that
poor
mir
jan
called
himself
a
disgraced
man
yes
that
was
it
could
that
stain
be
removed
mir
jan
was
doing
it
why
not
he
by
other
means
for
his
good
name
rested
on
the
word
of
a
perjured
woman
wealth
was
potent
but
not
he
would
ask
iris
to
wait
until
he
came
to
her
unsoiled
by
slander
purged
of
this
odium
cast
upon
him
unmerited
and
all
this
goes
to
show
that
he
a
man
wise
beyond
his
fellows
had
not
yet
learned
the
unwisdom
of
striving
to
lift
the
veil
of
tomorrow
behind
whose
mystic
curtain
what
is
to
be
ever
jostles
out
of
place
what
is
hoped
for
iris
smiling
in
her
dreams
was
assailed
by
no
torturing
doubts
robert
loved
her
that
was
enough
love
suffices
for
a
woman
a
man
asks
for
honor
reputation
an
unblemished
record
to
awake
her
he
kissed
her
he
knew
not
perchance
it
might
be
their
last
kiss
on
earth
not
yet
dawn
there
was
morning
in
the
air
for
the
first
faint
shafts
of
light
were
not
visible
from
their
eyrie
owing
to
its
position
but
there
was
much
to
be
done
if
the
dyaks
carried
out
the
plan
described
by
mir
jan
he
had
a
good
many
preparations
to
make
the
canvas
awning
was
rolled
back
and
the
stores
built
into
a
barricade
intended
to
shelter
iris
what
is
that
for
she
asked
when
she
discovered
its
nature
he
told
her
she
definitely
refused
to
avail
herself
of
any
such
protection
robert
dear
she
said
if
the
attack
comes
to
our
very
door
so
to
speak
surely
i
must
help
you
even
my
slight
aid
may
stem
a
rush
in
one
place
whilst
you
are
busy
in
another
he
explained
to
her
that
if
fighting
were
necessary
he
would
depend
more
upon
a
crowbar
than
a
rifle
to
sweep
the
ledge
clear
she
might
be
in
the
way
very
well
the
moment
you
tell
me
to
get
behind
that
fence
i
will
do
so
even
there
i
can
use
a
revolver
that
reminded
him
his
own
pistol
was
unloaded
he
possessed
only
five
more
cartridges
of
small
caliber
he
placed
them
in
the
weapon
and
gave
it
to
her
now
you
have
eleven
men
lives
in
your
hands
he
said
try
not
to
miss
if
you
must
shoot
in
the
dim
light
he
could
not
see
the
spasm
of
pain
that
clouded
her
face
no
dyak
would
reach
her
whilst
he
lived
if
he
fell
there
was
another
use
for
one
of
those
cartridges
the
sailor
had
cleared
the
main
floor
of
the
rock
and
was
placing
his
four
rifles
and
other
implements
within
easy
reach
when
a
hiss
came
from
beneath
mir
jan
exclaimed
iris
what
now
demanded
jenks
over
the
side
sahib
they
come
i
am
prepared
let
that
snake
get
back
to
his
hole
in
the
rock
lest
a
mongoose
seize
him
by
the
head
mir
jan
engaged
in
a
scouting
expedition
on
his
own
account
understood
that
the
orders
must
be
obeyed
he
vanished
soon
they
heard
a
great
crackling
among
the
bushes
on
the
right
but
jenks
knew
even
before
he
looked
that
the
dyaks
had
correctly
estimated
the
extent
of
his
fire
zone
and
would
keep
out
of
it
the
first
physical
intimation
of
the
enemy
design
they
received
was
a
pungent
but
pleasant
smell
of
burning
pine
borne
to
them
by
the
northerly
breeze
and
filling
the
air
with
its
aroma
the
dyaks
kindled
a
huge
fire
the
heat
was
perceptible
even
on
the
ledge
but
the
minutes
passed
and
the
dawn
broadened
into
day
without
any
other
result
being
achieved
iris
a
little
drawn
and
pale
with
suspense
said
with
a
timid
giggle
this
does
not
seem
to
be
so
very
serious
it
reminds
me
of
my
efforts
to
cook
there
is
more
to
follow
i
fear
dear
one
but
the
dyaks
are
fools
they
should
have
waited
until
night
fell
again
after
wearing
us
out
by
constant
vigilance
all
day
if
they
intend
to
employ
smoke
it
would
be
far
worse
for
us
at
night
phew
a
volume
of
murky
vapor
arose
that
nearly
suffocated
them
by
the
first
whiff
of
its
noisome
fumes
it
curled
like
a
black
pall
over
the
face
of
the
rock
and
blotted
out
sea
and
sky
they
coughed
incessantly
and
nearly
choked
for
the
dyaks
had
thrown
wet
seaweed
on
top
of
the
burning
pile
of
dry
wood
mir
jan
born
in
interior
india
knew
little
about
the
sea
or
its
products
and
when
the
savages
talked
of
seaweed
he
thought
they
meant
green
wood
fortunately
for
him
the
ascending
clouds
of
smoke
missed
the
cave
or
infallibly
he
must
have
been
stifled
lie
flat
on
the
rock
gasped
jenks
careless
of
waste
he
poured
water
over
a
coat
and
made
iris
bury
her
mouth
and
nose
in
the
wet
cloth
this
gave
her
immediate
relief
and
she
showed
her
woman
wit
by
tying
the
sleeves
of
the
garment
behind
her
neck
jenks
nodded
comprehension
and
followed
her
example
for
by
this
means
their
hands
were
left
free
the
black
cloud
grew
more
dense
each
few
seconds
nevertheless
owing
to
the
slope
of
the
ledge
and
the
tendency
of
the
smoke
to
rise
the
south
side
was
far
more
tenable
than
the
north
quick
to
note
this
favorable
circumstance
the
sailor
deduced
a
further
fact
from
it
a
barrier
erected
on
the
extreme
right
of
the
ledge
would
be
a
material
gain
he
sprang
up
dragged
the
huge
tarpaulin
from
its
former
location
and
propped
it
on
the
handle
of
the
pickaxe
driven
by
one
mighty
stroke
deep
into
a
crevice
of
the
rock
it
was
no
mean
feat
of
strength
that
he
performed
he
swung
the
heavy
and
cumbrous
canvas
into
position
as
if
it
were
a
dust
cloth
he
emerged
from
the
gloom
of
the
driven
cloud
but
triumphant
instantly
the
vapor
on
the
ledge
lessened
and
they
could
breathe
even
talk
overhead
and
in
front
the
smoke
swept
in
density
but
once
again
the
sailor
had
outwitted
the
dyaks
manoeuvres
we
have
won
the
first
rubber
he
whispered
to
iris
above
beneath
beyond
they
could
see
nothing
the
air
they
breathed
was
hot
and
foetid
it
was
like
being
immured
in
a
foul
tunnel
and
almost
as
dark
jenks
looked
over
the
parapet
he
thought
he
could
distinguish
some
vague
figures
on
the
sands
so
he
fired
at
them
a
volley
of
answering
bullets
crashed
into
the
rock
on
all
sides
the
dyaks
had
laid
their
plans
well
this
time
a
firing
squad
stationed
beyond
the
smoke
area
and
supplied
with
all
the
available
guns
commenced
and
kept
up
a
smart
fusillade
in
the
direction
of
the
ledge
in
order
to
cover
the
operations
of
the
scaling
party
jenks
realized
that
to
expose
himself
was
to
court
a
serious
wound
and
achieve
no
useful
purpose
he
fell
back
out
of
range
laid
down
his
rifle
and
grabbed
the
crowbar
at
brief
intervals
a
deep
hollow
boom
came
up
from
the
valley
at
first
it
puzzled
them
until
the
sailor
hit
upon
an
explanation
mir
jan
was
busy
the
end
of
a
strong
roughly
made
ladder
swung
through
the
smoke
and
banged
against
the
ledge
before
jenks
could
reach
it
those
hoisting
it
into
position
hastily
retreated
they
were
standing
in
front
of
the
cave
and
the
mahommedan
made
play
on
them
with
a
at
thirty
feet
jenks
using
his
crowbar
as
a
lever
toppled
the
ladder
clean
over
it
fell
outwards
and
disconcerted
a
section
of
the
musketeers
well
done
cried
iris
the
sailor
astounded
by
her
tone
gave
her
a
fleeting
glance
she
was
very
pale
now
but
not
with
fear
her
eyes
were
slightly
contracted
her
nostrils
quivering
her
lips
set
tight
and
her
chin
dimpled
she
had
gone
back
thirty
generations
in
as
many
seconds
thus
might
one
of
the
daughters
of
boadicea
have
looked
whilst
guiding
her
chariot
against
the
roman
phalanx
resting
on
one
knee
with
a
revolver
in
each
hand
she
seemed
no
puling
mate
for
the
gallant
man
who
fought
for
her
she
caught
his
look
we
will
beat
them
yet
she
cried
again
and
she
smiled
not
as
a
woman
smiles
but
with
the
joy
of
a
warrior
when
the
fray
is
toward
there
was
no
time
for
further
speech
three
ladders
were
reared
against
the
rock
they
were
so
poised
and
held
below
that
jenks
could
not
force
them
backwards
a
fourth
appeared
its
coarse
shafts
looming
into
sight
like
the
horns
of
some
gigantic
animal
the
four
covered
practically
the
whole
front
of
the
ledge
save
where
mir
jan
cleared
a
little
space
on
the
level
the
sailor
was
standing
now
with
the
crowbar
clenched
in
both
hands
the
firing
in
the
valley
slackened
and
died
away
a
dyak
face
grinning
like
a
japanese
demon
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
nearest
to
iris
do
fire
shouted
jenks
and
the
iron
bar
crushed
downwards
two
others
pitched
themselves
half
on
to
the
ledge
now
both
crowbar
and
revolver
were
needed
three
ladders
were
thus
cumbered
somewhat
for
those
beneath
and
jenks
sprang
towards
the
fourth
and
most
distant
men
were
crowding
it
like
ants
close
to
his
feet
lay
an
empty
it
was
a
crude
weapon
but
effective
when
well
pitched
and
the
sailor
had
never
made
a
better
shot
for
a
goal
in
the
midst
of
a
scrimmage
than
he
made
with
that
tub
for
the
head
of
the
uppermost
pirate
another
volley
came
from
the
sands
a
bullet
ploughed
through
his
hair
and
sent
his
flying
again
the
besiegers
swarmed
to
the
attack
one
way
or
the
other
they
must
succeed
a
man
and
a
woman
even
such
a
man
and
such
a
woman
could
not
keep
at
bay
an
infuriated
horde
of
fifty
savages
fighting
at
close
quarters
and
under
these
grievous
conditions
jenks
knew
what
would
happen
he
would
be
shot
in
the
head
or
breast
whilst
repelling
the
scaling
party
and
iris
dear
heart
she
was
thinking
of
him
keep
back
they
can
never
gain
the
ledge
she
shrieked
and
then
above
the
din
of
the
fusillade
the
yells
of
the
assailants
and
the
bawling
of
the
wounded
there
came
through
the
air
a
screaming
tearing
ripping
sound
which
drowned
all
others
it
traveled
with
incredible
speed
and
before
the
sailor
could
believe
his
ears
for
he
well
knew
what
it
meant
a
shrapnel
shell
burst
in
front
of
the
ledge
and
drenched
the
valley
with
flying
lead
jenks
was
just
able
to
drag
iris
flat
against
the
rock
ere
the
time
fuse
operated
and
the
bullets
flew
he
could
form
no
theory
hazard
no
conjecture
all
he
knew
was
that
a
shell
had
flown
towards
them
through
space
scattering
red
ruin
among
the
amazed
scoundrels
beneath
instantly
he
rose
again
lest
perchance
any
of
the
dyaks
should
have
gained
a
foothold
on
the
ledge
the
ladders
were
empty
he
could
hear
a
good
deal
of
groaning
the
footsteps
of
running
men
and
some
distant
shouting
sahib
yelled
mir
jan
drawn
from
his
retreat
by
the
commotion
without
yes
shouted
jenks
the
native
in
a
voice
cracked
with
excitement
told
him
something
the
sailor
asked
a
few
rapid
questions
to
make
quite
sure
that
mir
jan
was
not
mistaken
then
he
threw
his
arms
round
iris
drew
her
close
and
whispered
my
darling
we
are
saved
a
warship
has
anchored
just
beyond
the
south
reef
and
two
boats
filled
with
armed
sailors
are
now
pulling
ashore
and
she
answered
proudly
the
dyaks
could
never
have
conquered
us
robert
we
were
manifestly
under
god
protection
oh
my
love
my
love
i
am
so
happy
and
thankful
chapter
xv
the
difficulty
of
pleasing
everybody
the
drifting
smoke
was
still
so
dense
that
not
even
the
floor
of
the
valley
could
be
discerned
jenks
dared
not
leave
iris
at
such
a
moment
he
feared
to
bring
her
down
the
ladder
lest
another
shell
might
be
fired
but
something
must
be
done
to
end
their
suspense
he
called
to
mir
jan
take
off
your
turban
and
hold
it
above
your
head
if
you
think
they
can
see
you
from
the
warship
it
is
all
right
sahib
came
the
cheering
answer
one
boat
is
close
inshore
i
think
from
the
uniforms
they
are
english
sahibs
such
as
i
have
seen
at
garden
reach
the
dyaks
have
all
gone
nevertheless
jenks
waited
there
was
nothing
to
gain
by
being
too
precipitate
a
false
step
now
might
undo
the
achievements
of
many
weeks
mir
jan
was
dancing
about
beneath
in
a
state
of
wild
excitement
they
have
seen
the
dyaks
running
to
their
sampans
sahib
he
yelled
and
the
second
boat
is
being
pulled
in
that
direction
yet
another
has
just
left
the
ship
a
translation
made
iris
excited
eager
to
go
down
and
see
these
wonders
better
wait
here
dearest
he
said
the
enemy
may
be
driven
back
in
this
direction
and
i
can
not
expose
you
to
further
risk
the
sailors
will
soon
land
and
you
can
then
descend
in
perfect
safety
the
boom
of
a
cannon
came
from
the
sea
instinctively
the
girl
ducked
for
safety
though
her
companion
smiled
at
her
fears
for
the
shell
would
have
long
preceded
the
report
had
it
traveled
their
way
one
of
the
remaining
sampans
has
got
under
way
he
explained
and
the
warship
is
firing
at
her
two
more
guns
were
fired
the
evidently
meant
business
poor
wretches
murmured
iris
can
not
the
survivors
be
allowed
to
escape
well
we
are
unable
to
interfere
those
caught
on
the
island
will
probably
be
taken
to
the
mainland
and
hanged
for
their
crimes
so
the
manner
of
their
end
is
not
of
much
consequence
to
the
girl
manifest
relief
there
was
no
more
firing
and
mir
jan
announced
that
a
number
of
sailors
were
actually
on
shore
then
her
thoughts
turned
to
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
feminine
mind
even
in
the
gravest
moments
of
existence
she
laved
her
face
with
water
and
sought
her
discarded
skirt
soon
the
steady
tramp
of
feet
advancing
at
the
double
was
heard
on
the
shingle
and
an
officer
voice
speaking
the
crude
hindustani
of
the
and
forecastle
shouted
to
mir
jan
hi
you
black
fellow
are
there
any
white
people
here
jenks
sang
out
yes
two
of
us
perched
on
the
rock
over
your
heads
we
are
coming
down
he
cast
loose
the
iris
was
limp
and
trembling
steady
sweetheart
he
whispered
do
forget
the
slip
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
hold
tight
but
have
no
fear
i
will
be
just
beneath
it
was
well
he
took
this
precaution
she
was
now
so
unnerved
that
an
unguarded
movement
might
have
led
to
an
accident
but
the
knowledge
that
her
lover
was
near
the
touch
of
his
hand
guiding
her
feet
on
to
the
rungs
of
the
ladder
sustained
her
they
had
almost
reached
the
level
when
a
loud
exclamation
and
the
crash
of
a
heavy
blow
caused
jenks
to
halt
and
look
downwards
a
dyak
lying
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
scaling
ladders
and
severely
wounded
by
a
shell
splinter
witnessed
their
descent
in
his
left
hand
he
grasped
a
parang
his
right
arm
was
bandaged
though
unable
to
rise
the
vengeful
pirate
mustered
his
remaining
strength
to
crawl
towards
the
swaying
ladder
it
was
taung
inspired
with
the
hate
and
venom
of
the
dying
snake
even
yet
he
hoped
to
deal
a
mortal
stroke
at
the
man
who
had
defied
him
and
all
his
band
he
might
have
succeeded
as
jenks
was
so
taken
up
with
iris
were
it
not
for
the
watchful
eyes
of
mir
jan
the
mahommedan
sprang
at
him
with
an
oath
and
gave
him
such
a
murderous
whack
with
the
butt
of
a
rifle
that
the
dyak
chief
collapsed
and
breathed
out
his
fierce
spirit
in
a
groan
at
the
first
glance
jenks
did
not
recognize
taung
owing
to
his
change
of
costume
through
the
thinner
smoke
he
could
see
several
sailors
running
up
look
out
there
he
cried
there
is
a
lady
here
if
any
dyak
moves
knock
him
on
the
head
but
with
the
passing
of
the
chief
their
last
peril
had
gone
the
next
instant
they
were
standing
on
the
firm
ground
and
a
british
naval
lieutenant
was
saying
eagerly
we
seem
to
have
turned
up
in
the
nick
of
time
do
you
by
any
chance
belong
to
the
we
are
the
sole
survivors
answered
the
sailor
you
two
only
yes
she
struck
on
the
reef
of
this
island
during
a
typhoon
this
lady
miss
iris
deane
and
i
were
flung
ashore
miss
deane
can
it
be
possible
let
me
congratulate
you
most
heartily
sir
arthur
deane
is
on
board
the
at
this
moment
the
iris
was
dazed
the
uniforms
the
pleasant
faces
of
the
english
sailors
the
strange
sensation
of
hearing
familiar
words
in
tones
other
than
those
of
the
man
she
loved
bewildered
her
yes
explained
the
officer
with
a
sympathetic
smile
that
our
ship
you
know
in
the
offing
there
it
was
all
too
wonderful
to
be
quite
understood
yet
she
turned
to
robert
do
you
hear
they
say
my
father
is
not
far
away
take
me
to
him
illustration
we
are
the
sole
survivors
answered
the
sailor
no
need
for
that
miss
interrupted
a
warrant
officer
here
he
is
coming
ashore
he
wanted
to
come
with
us
but
the
captain
would
not
permit
it
as
there
seemed
to
be
some
trouble
ahead
sure
enough
even
the
girl
swimming
eyes
could
distinguish
the
civilian
seated
beside
an
officer
in
the
of
a
small
gig
now
threading
a
path
through
the
broken
reef
beyond
turtle
beach
in
five
minutes
father
and
daughter
would
meet
meanwhile
the
officer
intent
on
duty
addressed
jenks
again
may
i
ask
who
you
are
my
name
is
anstruther
robert
anstruther
iris
clinging
to
his
arm
heard
the
reply
so
he
had
abandoned
all
pretence
he
was
ready
to
face
the
world
at
her
side
she
stole
a
loving
glance
at
him
as
she
cried
yes
captain
anstruther
of
the
indian
staff
corps
if
he
will
not
tell
you
all
that
he
has
done
how
he
has
saved
my
life
twenty
times
how
he
has
fought
against
eighty
men
ask
me
the
naval
officer
did
not
need
to
look
a
second
time
at
iris
face
to
lengthen
the
list
of
captain
anstruther
achievements
by
one
more
item
he
sighed
a
good
sailor
always
does
sigh
when
a
particularly
pretty
girl
is
labeled
engaged
but
he
could
be
very
polite
captain
anstruther
does
not
appear
to
have
left
much
for
us
to
do
miss
deane
he
said
indeed
turning
to
robert
is
there
any
way
in
which
my
men
will
be
useful
i
would
recommend
that
they
drag
the
green
stuff
off
that
fire
and
stop
the
smoke
then
a
detachment
should
go
round
the
north
side
of
the
island
and
drive
the
remaining
dyaks
into
the
hands
of
the
party
you
have
landed
as
i
understand
at
the
further
end
of
the
south
beach
mir
jan
the
mahommedan
here
who
has
been
a
most
faithful
ally
during
part
of
our
siege
will
act
as
guide
the
other
man
cast
a
comprehensive
glance
over
the
rock
with
its
scaling
ladders
and
dangling
the
cave
the
little
groups
of
dead
or
unconscious
pirates
for
every
wounded
man
who
could
move
a
limb
had
crawled
away
after
the
first
shell
burst
and
drew
a
deep
breath
how
long
were
you
up
there
he
asked
over
thirty
hours
it
was
a
great
fight
somewhat
worse
than
it
looks
said
anstruther
this
is
only
the
end
of
it
altogether
we
have
accounted
for
nearly
two
score
of
the
poor
devils
do
you
think
you
can
make
them
prisoners
without
killing
any
more
of
them
asked
iris
that
depends
entirely
on
themselves
miss
deane
my
men
will
not
fire
a
shot
unless
they
encounter
resistance
robert
looked
towards
the
approaching
boat
she
would
not
land
yet
for
a
couple
of
minutes
by
the
way
he
said
will
you
tell
me
your
name
playdon
lieutenant
philip
h
playdon
do
you
know
to
what
nation
this
island
belongs
it
is
land
i
think
it
is
marked
on
the
chart
then
said
anstruther
i
call
upon
you
lieutenant
playdon
and
all
others
here
present
to
witness
that
i
robert
anstruther
late
of
the
indian
army
acting
on
behalf
of
myself
and
miss
iris
deane
declare
that
we
have
taken
possession
of
this
island
in
the
name
of
his
britannic
majesty
the
king
of
england
that
we
are
the
joint
occupiers
and
owners
thereof
and
claim
all
property
rights
vested
therein
these
formal
phrases
coming
at
such
a
moment
amazed
his
hearers
iris
alone
had
an
inkling
of
the
underlying
motive
i
do
suppose
any
one
will
dispute
your
title
said
the
naval
officer
gravely
he
unquestionably
imagined
that
suffering
and
exposure
had
slightly
disturbed
the
other
man
senses
yet
he
had
seldom
seen
any
person
who
looked
to
be
in
more
complete
possession
of
his
faculties
thank
you
replied
robert
with
equal
composure
though
he
felt
inclined
to
laugh
at
playdon
mystification
i
only
wished
to
secure
a
sufficient
number
of
witnesses
for
a
verbal
declaration
when
i
have
a
few
minutes
to
spare
i
will
affix
a
legal
notice
on
the
wall
in
front
of
our
cave
playdon
bowed
silently
there
was
something
in
the
speaker
manner
that
puzzled
him
he
detailed
a
small
guard
to
accompany
robert
and
iris
who
now
walked
towards
the
beach
and
asked
mir
jan
to
pilot
him
as
suggested
by
anstruther
the
boat
was
yet
many
yards
from
shore
when
iris
ran
forward
and
stretched
out
her
arms
to
the
man
who
was
staring
at
her
with
wistful
despair
father
father
she
cried
do
you
know
me
sir
arthur
deane
was
looking
at
the
two
strange
figures
on
the
sands
and
each
moment
his
heart
sank
lower
this
island
held
his
final
hope
during
many
weary
weeks
since
the
day
when
a
kindly
admiral
placed
the
cruiser
at
his
disposal
he
had
scoured
the
china
sea
the
coasts
of
borneo
and
java
for
some
tidings
of
the
he
met
naught
save
blank
nothingness
the
silence
of
the
great
ocean
mausoleum
not
a
boat
a
spar
a
lifebuoy
was
cast
up
by
the
waves
to
yield
faintest
trace
of
the
lost
steamer
every
naval
man
knew
what
had
happened
the
vessel
had
met
with
some
mishap
to
her
machinery
struck
a
derelict
or
turned
turtle
during
that
memorable
typhoon
of
march
and
she
had
gone
down
with
all
hands
her
fate
was
a
foregone
conclusion
no
ship
boat
could
live
in
that
sea
even
if
the
crew
were
able
to
launch
one
it
was
another
of
ocean
tragedies
with
the
fifth
act
left
to
the
imagination
to
examine
every
sand
patch
and
shoal
in
the
china
sea
was
an
impossible
task
all
the
could
do
was
to
visit
the
principal
islands
and
institute
inquiries
among
the
fishermen
and
small
traders
at
last
the
previous
night
a
malay
tempted
by
hope
of
reward
boarded
the
vessel
when
lying
at
anchor
off
the
large
island
away
to
the
south
and
told
the
captain
a
wondrous
tale
of
a
place
inhabited
by
two
white
spirits
a
male
and
a
female
whither
a
local
pirate
named
taung
had
gone
by
chance
with
his
men
and
suffered
great
loss
but
taung
was
bewitched
by
the
female
spirit
and
had
returned
there
with
a
great
force
swearing
to
capture
her
or
perish
the
spirits
the
malay
said
had
dwelt
upon
the
island
for
many
years
his
father
and
grandfather
knew
the
place
and
feared
it
taung
would
never
be
seen
again
this
queer
yarn
was
the
first
indication
they
received
of
the
whereabouts
of
any
persons
who
might
possibly
be
shipwrecked
europeans
though
not
survivors
from
the
anyhow
the
tiny
dot
lay
in
the
vessel
northward
track
so
a
course
was
set
to
arrive
off
the
island
soon
after
dawn
events
on
shore
as
seen
by
the
officer
on
watch
told
their
own
tale
wherever
dyaks
are
fighting
there
is
mischief
on
foot
so
the
took
a
hand
in
the
proceedings
but
sir
arthur
deane
after
an
agonized
scrutiny
of
the
persons
escorted
by
the
sailors
to
the
water
edge
sadly
acknowledged
that
neither
of
these
could
be
the
daughter
whom
he
sought
he
bowed
his
head
in
humble
resignation
and
he
thought
he
was
the
victim
of
a
cruel
hallucination
when
iris
tremulous
accents
reached
his
ears
father
father
do
you
know
me
he
stood
up
amazed
and
trembling
yes
father
dear
it
is
i
your
own
little
girl
given
back
to
you
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
can
not
see
you
for
my
tears
they
had
some
difficulty
to
keep
him
in
the
boat
and
the
man
pulling
stroke
smashed
a
stout
oar
with
the
next
wrench
and
so
they
met
at
last
and
the
sailors
left
them
alone
to
crowd
round
anstruther
and
ply
him
with
a
hundred
questions
although
he
fell
in
with
their
humor
and
gradually
pieced
together
the
stirring
story
which
was
supplemented
each
instant
by
the
arrival
of
disconsolate
dyaks
and
the
comments
of
the
men
who
returned
from
cave
and
beach
his
soul
was
filled
with
the
sight
of
iris
and
her
father
and
the
happy
inconsequent
demands
with
which
each
sought
to
ascertain
and
relieve
the
extent
of
the
other
anxiety
then
iris
called
to
him
robert
i
want
you
the
use
of
his
christian
name
created
something
akin
to
a
sensation
sir
arthur
deane
was
startled
even
in
his
immeasurable
delight
at
finding
his
child
uninjured
the
picture
of
rude
health
and
happiness
anstruther
advanced
this
is
my
father
she
cried
shrill
with
joy
and
father
darling
this
is
captain
robert
anstruther
to
whom
alone
under
god
will
i
owe
my
life
many
many
times
since
the
moment
the
was
lost
it
was
no
time
for
questioning
sir
arthur
deane
took
off
his
hat
and
held
out
his
hand
captain
anstruther
he
said
as
i
owe
you
my
daughter
life
i
owe
you
that
which
i
can
never
repay
and
i
owe
you
my
own
life
too
for
i
could
not
have
survived
the
knowledge
that
she
was
dead
robert
took
the
proffered
hand
i
think
sir
arthur
that
of
the
two
i
am
the
more
deeply
indebted
there
are
some
privileges
whose
value
can
not
be
measured
and
among
them
the
privilege
of
restoring
your
daughter
to
your
arms
takes
the
highest
place
then
being
much
more
than
the
older
man
who
was
naturally
in
a
state
of
agitation
that
was
almost
painful
he
turned
to
iris
i
think
he
said
that
your
father
should
take
you
on
board
the
iris
there
you
may
perhaps
find
some
suitable
clothing
eat
something
and
recover
from
the
exciting
events
of
the
morning
afterwards
you
must
bring
sir
arthur
ashore
again
and
we
will
guide
him
over
the
island
i
am
sure
you
will
find
much
to
tell
him
meanwhile
the
baronet
could
not
fail
to
note
the
manner
in
which
these
two
addressed
each
other
the
fearless
love
which
leaped
from
eye
to
eye
the
calm
acceptance
of
a
relationship
not
be
questioned
or
gainsaid
robert
and
iris
without
spoken
word
on
the
subject
had
tactily
agreed
to
avoid
the
slightest
semblance
of
subterfuge
as
unworthy
alike
of
their
achievements
and
their
love
yet
what
could
sir
arthur
deane
do
to
frame
a
suitable
protest
at
such
a
moment
was
not
to
be
dreamed
of
as
yet
he
was
too
shaken
to
collect
his
thoughts
proposal
however
helped
him
to
blurt
out
what
he
intuitively
felt
to
be
a
disagreeable
fact
yet
something
must
be
said
for
his
brain
reeled
your
suggestion
is
admirable
he
cried
striving
desperately
to
affect
a
careless
complaisance
the
ship
stores
may
provide
iris
with
some
sort
of
and
an
old
friend
of
hers
is
on
board
at
this
moment
little
expecting
her
presence
lord
ventnor
has
accompanied
me
in
my
search
he
will
of
course
be
delighted
anstruther
flushed
a
deep
bronze
but
iris
broke
in
father
why
did
come
with
you
sir
arthur
driven
into
this
sudden
squall
of
explanation
became
dignified
well
you
see
my
dear
under
the
circumstances
he
felt
an
anxiety
almost
commensurate
with
my
own
but
why
why
iris
was
quite
calm
with
robert
near
she
was
courageous
even
the
perturbed
baronet
experienced
a
new
sensation
as
his
troubled
glance
fell
before
her
searching
eyes
his
daughter
had
left
him
a
joyous
heedless
girl
he
found
her
a
woman
strong
purposeful
yet
he
kept
on
choosing
the
most
straightforward
means
as
the
only
honorable
way
of
clearing
a
course
so
beset
with
unsuspected
obstacles
it
is
only
reasonable
iris
that
your
affianced
husband
should
suffer
an
agony
of
apprehension
on
your
account
and
do
all
that
was
possible
to
effect
your
rescue
my
affianced
husband
well
my
dear
girl
perhaps
that
is
hardly
the
correct
phrase
from
your
point
of
view
yet
you
can
not
fail
to
remember
that
lord
ventnor
father
dear
said
iris
solemnly
but
in
a
voice
free
from
all
uncertainty
my
affianced
husband
stands
here
we
plighted
our
troth
at
the
very
gate
of
death
it
was
ratified
in
the
presence
of
god
and
has
been
blessed
by
him
i
have
made
no
compact
with
lord
ventnor
he
is
a
base
and
unworthy
man
did
you
but
know
the
truth
concerning
him
you
would
not
mention
his
name
in
the
same
breath
with
mine
would
he
robert
never
was
man
so
perplexed
as
the
unfortunate
shipowner
in
the
instant
that
his
beloved
daughter
was
restored
to
him
out
of
the
very
depths
of
the
sea
he
was
asked
either
to
undertake
the
rôle
of
a
disappointed
and
unforgiving
parent
or
sanction
her
marriage
to
a
person
of
most
forbidding
if
otherwise
manly
appearance
who
had
certainly
saved
her
from
death
in
ways
not
presently
clear
to
him
but
who
could
not
be
regarded
as
a
suitable
solely
on
that
account
what
could
he
do
what
could
he
say
to
make
the
position
less
intolerable
anstruther
quicker
than
iris
to
appreciate
sir
arthur
deane
dilemma
gallantly
helped
him
he
placed
a
loving
hand
on
the
girl
shoulder
be
advised
by
me
sir
arthur
and
you
too
iris
he
said
this
is
no
hour
for
such
explanations
leave
me
to
deal
with
lord
ventnor
i
am
content
to
trust
the
ultimate
verdict
to
you
sir
arthur
you
will
learn
in
due
course
all
that
has
happened
go
on
board
iris
meet
lord
ventnor
as
you
would
meet
any
other
friend
you
will
not
marry
him
i
know
i
can
trust
you
he
said
this
with
a
smile
that
robbed
the
words
of
serious
purport
believe
me
you
two
can
find
plenty
to
occupy
your
minds
today
without
troubling
yourselves
about
lord
ventnor
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
murmured
the
baronet
who
notwithstanding
his
worry
was
far
too
experienced
a
man
of
the
world
not
to
acknowledge
the
good
sense
of
this
advice
no
matter
how
ruffianly
might
be
the
guise
of
the
strange
person
who
gave
it
that
is
settled
then
said
robert
laughing
for
he
well
knew
what
a
weird
spectacle
he
must
present
to
the
bewildered
old
gentleman
even
sir
arthur
deane
was
fascinated
by
the
ragged
and
hairy
giant
who
carried
himself
so
masterfully
and
helped
everybody
over
the
stile
at
the
right
moment
he
tried
to
develop
the
change
in
the
conversation
by
the
way
he
said
how
came
you
to
be
on
the
i
have
a
list
of
all
the
passengers
and
crew
and
your
name
does
not
appear
therein
oh
that
is
easily
accounted
for
i
shipped
as
a
steward
in
the
name
of
robert
jenks
robert
jenks
a
steward
this
was
worse
than
ever
the
unhappy
shipowner
thought
the
sky
must
have
fallen
yes
that
forms
some
part
of
the
promised
explanation
iris
rapidly
gathered
the
drift
of
her
lover
wishes
come
father
she
cried
merrily
i
am
aching
to
see
what
the
ship
stores
which
you
and
robert
pin
your
faith
to
can
do
for
me
in
the
shape
of
garments
i
have
the
utmost
belief
in
the
british
navy
and
even
a
skeptic
should
be
convinced
of
its
infallibility
if
is
able
to
provide
a
lady
outfit
sir
arthur
deane
gladly
availed
himself
of
the
proffered
compromise
he
assisted
iris
into
the
boat
though
that
active
young
person
was
far
better
able
to
support
him
and
a
word
to
the
officer
in
command
sent
the
gig
flying
back
to
the
ship
anstruther
during
a
momentary
delay
made
a
small
request
on
his
own
account
lieutenant
playdon
nearly
as
big
a
man
as
robert
despatched
a
note
to
his
servant
and
the
gig
speedily
returned
with
a
complete
assortment
of
clothing
and
linen
the
man
also
brought
a
dressing
case
with
the
result
that
a
dip
in
the
bath
and
ten
minutes
in
the
hands
of
an
expert
valet
made
anstruther
a
new
man
acting
under
his
advice
the
bodies
of
the
dead
were
thrown
into
the
lagoon
the
wounded
were
collected
in
the
hut
to
be
attended
to
by
the
ship
surgeon
and
the
prisoners
were
paraded
in
front
of
mir
jan
who
identified
every
man
and
found
by
counting
heads
that
none
was
missing
robert
did
not
forget
to
write
out
a
formal
notice
and
fasten
it
to
the
rock
this
proceeding
further
mystified
the
officers
of
the
who
had
gradually
formed
a
connected
idea
of
the
great
fight
made
by
the
shipwrecked
pair
though
anstruther
squirmed
inwardly
when
he
thought
of
the
manner
in
which
iris
would
picture
the
scene
as
it
was
he
had
the
first
innings
and
he
did
not
fail
to
use
the
opportunity
in
the
few
terse
words
which
the
militant
briton
best
understands
he
described
the
girl
fortitude
her
unflagging
cheerfulness
her
uncomplaining
readiness
to
do
and
dare
little
was
said
by
his
auditors
save
to
interpolate
an
occasional
question
as
to
why
such
and
such
a
thing
was
necessary
or
how
some
particular
drawback
had
been
surmounted
standing
near
the
well
it
was
not
necessary
to
move
to
explain
to
them
the
chief
features
of
the
island
and
point
out
the
measures
he
had
adopted
when
he
ended
the
first
lieutenant
who
commanded
the
boats
sent
in
pursuit
of
the
flying
dyaks
the
sank
both
sampans
as
soon
as
they
were
launched
summed
up
the
general
verdict
you
do
not
need
our
admiration
captain
anstruther
each
man
of
us
envies
you
from
the
bottom
of
his
soul
i
do
i
know
from
the
very
bilge
exclaimed
a
stout
midshipman
one
of
those
who
had
seen
iris
robert
waited
until
the
laugh
died
away
there
is
an
error
about
my
rank
he
said
i
did
once
hold
a
commission
in
the
indian
army
but
i
was
and
cashiered
in
hong
kong
six
months
ago
i
was
unjustly
convicted
on
a
grave
charge
and
i
hope
some
day
to
clear
myself
meanwhile
i
am
a
mere
civilian
it
was
only
miss
deane
generous
sympathy
which
led
her
to
mention
my
former
rank
mr
playdon
had
another
of
the
shells
suddenly
burst
in
the
midst
of
the
group
of
officers
it
would
have
created
less
dismay
than
this
unexpected
avowal
cashiered
none
but
a
service
man
can
grasp
the
awful
significance
of
those
words
to
the
commissioned
ranks
of
the
army
and
navy
anstruther
well
knew
what
he
was
doing
somehow
he
found
nothing
hard
in
the
performance
of
these
penances
now
of
course
the
ugly
truth
must
be
revealed
the
moment
lord
ventnor
heard
his
name
it
was
not
fair
to
the
good
fellows
crowding
around
him
and
offering
every
attention
that
the
frank
hospitality
of
the
british
sailor
could
suggest
to
permit
them
to
adopt
the
tone
of
friendly
equality
which
rigid
discipline
if
nothing
else
would
not
allow
them
to
maintain
the
first
lieutenant
by
reason
of
his
rank
was
compelled
to
say
something
that
is
a
devilish
bad
job
anstruther
he
blurted
out
well
you
know
i
had
to
tell
you
he
smiled
unaffectedly
at
the
wondering
circle
he
too
was
an
officer
and
appreciated
their
sentiments
they
were
unfeignedly
sorry
for
him
a
man
so
brave
and
modest
such
a
splendid
type
of
the
soldier
and
gentleman
yet
by
their
common
law
an
outcast
nor
could
they
wholly
understand
his
demeanor
there
was
a
noble
dignity
in
his
candor
a
conscious
innocence
that
disdained
to
shield
itself
under
a
partial
truth
he
spoke
not
as
a
but
as
one
who
addresses
those
who
have
been
and
will
be
once
more
his
peers
the
first
lieutenant
again
phrased
the
thoughts
of
his
juniors
i
and
every
other
man
in
the
ship
can
not
help
but
sympathize
with
you
but
whatever
may
be
your
record
if
you
were
an
escaped
convict
anstruther
no
one
could
withhold
from
you
the
praise
deserved
for
your
magnificent
stand
against
overwhelming
odds
our
duty
is
plain
we
will
bring
you
to
singapore
where
the
others
will
no
doubt
wish
to
go
immediately
i
will
tell
the
captain
what
you
have
been
good
enough
to
acquaint
us
with
meanwhile
we
will
give
you
every
assistance
and
er
attention
in
our
power
a
murmur
of
approbation
ran
through
the
little
circle
robert
face
paled
somewhat
what
chaps
they
were
to
be
sure
i
can
only
thank
you
he
said
unsteadily
your
kindness
is
more
trying
than
adversity
a
rustle
of
silk
the
intrusion
into
the
intent
knot
of
men
of
a
young
lady
in
a
paris
gown
a
paris
hat
carrying
a
trouville
parasol
and
most
exquisitely
gloved
and
booted
made
every
one
gasp
oh
robert
dear
how
you
i
actually
did
know
you
thus
iris
bewitchingly
attired
and
gazing
now
with
provoking
admiration
at
robert
who
certainly
offered
almost
as
great
a
contrast
to
his
former
state
as
did
the
girl
herself
he
returned
her
look
with
interest
would
any
man
believe
he
laughed
that
clothes
would
do
so
much
for
a
woman
what
a
compliment
but
come
dearest
captain
fitzroy
and
lord
ventnor
have
come
ashore
with
father
and
me
they
want
us
to
show
them
everything
you
will
excuse
him
wo
you
she
added
with
a
seraphic
smile
to
the
others
they
walked
off
together
jimmy
gasped
the
fat
midshipman
to
a
lanky
youth
she
got
on
your
togs
meaning
that
iris
had
ransacked
the
theatrical
wardrobe
and
pounced
on
the
swell
outfit
of
the
principal
female
impersonator
in
the
ship
company
lieutenant
playdon
bit
the
chin
strap
of
his
pith
helmet

party

the
regulation
uniform
for
service

in
the
tropics
he
muttered
to
his
chief
damme
if
i
got
the
hang
of
this
business
yet
neither
have
anstruther
looks
a
decent
sort
of
fellow
and
the
girl
is
a
stunner
yet
d
know
playdon
right
through
the
cruise
always
understood
that
she
was
the
fiancée
of
that
cad
ventnor
anstruther
appears
to
have
arranged
matters
differently
wonder
what
pa
will
say
when
that
johnnie
owns
up
about
the
give
it
up
which
is
more
than
the
girl
will
do
or
i
much
mistaken
funny
thing
you
know
but
i
a
sort
of
hazy
recollection
of
anstruther
name
being
mixed
up
with
that
of
a
colonel
wife
at
hong
kong
fancy
ventnor
was
in
it
too
as
a
witness

by
and

something

chapter
xvi
bargains
great
and
small
lord
ventnor
was
no
fool
whilst
iris
was
transforming
herself
from
a
condition
into
a
semblance
of
an
ultra
parisienne
the
dramatic
costumier
went
in
for
strong
stage
effects
in
feminine
attire
sir
arthur
deane
told
the
earl
something
of
the
state
of
affairs
on
the
island
his
lordship
a
handsome
saturnine
man
cool
insolently
polite
and
plentifully
endowed
with
the
judgmatical
daring
that
is
the
necessary
equipment
of
a
society
libertine
counseled
patience
toleration
even
silent
recognition
of
anstruther
undoubted
claims
for
services
rendered
she
is
an
enthusiastic
girl
he
urged
upon
his
surprised
hearer
who
expected
a
very
different
expression
of
opinion
this
fellow
anstruther
is
a
plausible
sort
of
rascal
a
good
man
in
a
tight
place
too
just
the
sort
of
blackguard
who
would
fill
the
heroic
bill
where
a
fight
is
concerned
damn
him
he
licked
me
twice
further
amazement
for
the
shipowner
yes
it
quite
true
i
interfered
with
his
little
games
and
he
gave
me
the
usual
reward
of
the
devil
apothecary
leave
iris
alone
at
present
she
is
strung
up
to
an
intense
pitch
of
gratitude
having
barely
escaped
a
terrible
fate
let
her
come
back
to
the
normal
anstruther
shady
record
must
gradually
leak
out
that
will
disgust
her
in
a
week
she
will
appeal
to
you
to
buy
him
off
he
is
hard
up
cut
off
by
his
people
and
that
sort
of
thing
there
you
probably
have
the
measure
of
his
scheming
he
knows
quite
well
that
he
can
never
marry
your
daughter
it
is
all
a
matter
of
price
sir
arthur
willingly
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
at
the
back
of
his
head
there
was
an
uneasy
consciousness
that
it
was
not
all
a
matter
of
price
if
it
were
he
would
never
trust
a
man
face
again
but
ventnor
arguments
swayed
him
the
course
indicated
was
the
only
decent
one
it
was
humanly
impossible
for
a
man
to
chide
his
daughter
and
flout
her
rescuer
within
an
hour
of
finding
them
lord
ventnor
played
his
cards
with
a
deeper
design
he
bowed
to
the
inevitable
iris
said
she
loved
his
rival
very
well
to
attempt
to
dissuade
her
was
to
throw
her
more
closely
into
that
rival
arms
the
right
course
was
to
appear
resigned
saddened
compelled
against
his
will
to
reveal
the
distressing
truth
further
he
counted
on
anstruther
quick
temper
as
an
active
agent
such
a
man
would
be
the
first
to
rebel
against
an
assumption
of
pitying
tolerance
he
would
bring
bitter
charges
of
conspiracy
of
unbelievable
compact
to
secure
his
ruin
all
this
must
recoil
on
his
own
head
when
the
facts
were
laid
bare
not
even
the
hero
of
the
island
could
prevail
against
the
terrible
indictment
of
the
finally
at
singapore
three
days
distant
colonel
costobell
and
his
wife
were
staying
lord
ventnor
alone
of
those
on
board
knew
this
indeed
he
accompanied
sir
arthur
deane
largely
in
order
to
break
off
a
somewhat
trying
entanglement
he
smiled
complacently
as
he
thought
of
the
effect
on
iris
of
costobell
indignant
remonstrances
when
the
baronet
asked
that
injured
lady
to
tell
the
girl
all
that
had
happened
at
hong
kong
in
a
word
lord
ventnor
was
most
profoundly
annoyed
and
he
cursed
anstruther
from
the
depths
of
his
heart
but
he
could
see
a
way
out
the
more
desperate
the
emergency
the
more
need
to
display
finesse
above
all
he
must
avoid
an
immediate
rupture
he
came
ashore
with
iris
and
her
father
the
captain
of
the
also
joined
the
party
the
three
men
watched
robert
and
the
girl
walking
towards
them
from
the
group
of
officers
anstruther
is
a
fellow
commented
captain
fitzroy
who
is
he
truth
to
tell
the
gallant
commander
of
the
was
secretly
amazed
by
the
metamorphosis
effected
in
robert
appearance
since
he
scrutinized
him
through
his
glasses
iris
too
unaccustomed
to
the
constraint
of
shoes
clung
to
the
nondescript
arm
in
a
manner
that
shook
the
sailor
faith
in
lord
ventnor
pretensions
as
her
favored
suitor
poor
sir
arthur
said
not
a
word
but
his
lordship
was
quite
at
ease
from
his
name
and
from
what
deane
tells
me
i
believe
he
is
an
of
the
indian
army
ah
he
has
left
the
service
yes
i
met
him
last
in
hong
kong
then
you
know
him
quite
well
if
he
is
the
man
i
imagine
that
is
really
very
nice
of
ventnor
thought
the
shipowner
the
last
thing
i
should
credit
him
with
would
be
a
forgiving
disposition
meanwhile
anstruther
was
reading
iris
a
little
lecture
sweet
one
he
explained
to
her
do
not
allude
to
me
by
my
former
rank
i
am
not
entitled
to
it
some
day
please
god
it
will
be
restored
to
me
at
present
i
am
a
plain
civilian
i
think
you
very
handsome
do
tease
there
a
good
girl
it
is
not
fair
with
all
these
people
looking
but
really
robert
only
since
you
scraped
off
the
upper
crust
have
i
been
able
to
recognize
you
again
i
remember
now
that
i
thought
you
were
a
most
distinguished
looking
steward
well
i
am
helpless
i
can
not
even
squeeze
you
by
the
way
iris
during
the
next
few
days
say
nothing
about
our
mine
oh
why
not
just
a
personal
whim
it
will
please
me
if
it
pleases
you
robert
i
am
satisfied
he
pressed
her
arm
by
way
of
answer
they
were
too
near
to
the
waiting
trio
for
other
comment
captain
fitzroy
cried
iris
let
me
introduce
anstruther
to
you
lord
ventnor
you
have
met
anstruther
before
the
sailor
shook
hands
lord
ventnor
smiled
affably
your
enforced
residence
on
the
island
seems
to
have
agreed
with
you
he
said
admirably
life
here
had
its
drawbacks
but
we
fought
our
enemies
in
the
open
did
we
iris
yes
dear
the
poor
dyaks
were
not
sufficiently
modernized
to
attack
us
with
false
testimony
his
lordship
sallow
face
wrinkled
somewhat
so
iris
knew
of
the
nor
was
she
afraid
to
proclaim
to
all
the
world
that
this
man
was
her
lover
as
for
captain
fitzroy
his
bushy
eyebrows
disappeared
into
his
peaked
cap
when
he
heard
the
manner
of
their
speech
nevertheless
ventnor
smiled
again
even
the
dyaks
respected
miss
deane
he
said
but
anstruther
sorry
for
the
manifest
uneasiness
of
the
shipowner
repressed
the
retort
on
his
lips
and
forthwith
suggested
that
they
should
walk
to
the
north
beach
in
the
first
instance
that
being
the
scene
of
the
wreck
during
the
next
hour
he
became
auditor
rather
than
narrator
it
was
iris
who
told
of
his
wild
fight
against
wind
and
waves
iris
who
showed
them
where
he
fought
with
the
iris
who
expatiated
on
the
long
days
of
ceaseless
toil
his
dauntless
courage
in
the
face
of
every
difficulty
the
way
in
which
he
rescued
her
from
the
clutch
of
the
savages
the
skill
of
his
preparations
against
the
anticipated
attack
and
the
last
great
achievement
of
all
when
time
after
time
he
foiled
the
dyaks
plans
and
flung
them
off
crippled
and
disheartened
during
the
many
phases
of
the
thirty
hours
battle
she
had
an
attentive
audience
most
of
the
officers
quietly
came
up
and
followed
the
girl
glowing
recital
with
breathless
interest
robert
vainly
endeavored
more
than
once
to
laugh
away
her
thrilling
eulogy
but
she
would
have
none
of
it
her
heart
was
in
her
words
he
deserved
this
tribute
of
praise
unstinted
unmeasured
abundant
in
its
simple
truth
yet
sounding
like
a
legend
spun
by
some
romantic
poet
were
not
the
grim
evidences
of
its
accuracy
visible
on
every
hand
she
was
so
volubly
clear
so
precise
in
fact
so
subtle
in
her
clever
delineations
of
humorous
or
tragic
events
that
her
father
was
astounded
and
even
anstruther
silently
admitted
that
a
man
might
live
until
he
equaled
the
years
of
a
biblical
patriarch
without
discovering
all
the
resources
of
a
woman
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
when
she
ended
but
they
were
tears
of
thankful
happiness
and
lord
ventnor
a
silent
listener
who
missed
neither
word
nor
look
felt
a
deeper
chill
in
his
cold
heart
as
he
realized
that
this
woman
love
could
never
be
his
the
knowledge
excited
his
passion
the
more
his
hatred
of
anstruther
now
became
a
mania
an
insensate
resolve
to
mortally
stab
this
meddler
who
always
stood
in
his
path
robert
hoped
that
his
present
ordeal
was
over
it
had
only
begun
he
was
called
on
to
answer
questions
without
number
why
had
the
tunnel
been
made
what
was
the
mystery
of
the
valley
of
death
how
did
he
manage
to
guess
the
dimensions
of
the
how
came
he
to
acquire
such
an
amazing
stock
of
knowledge
of
the
edible
properties
of
roots
and
trees
how
why
where
when
they
never
would
be
satisfied
for
not
even
the
british
navypoking
its
nose
into
the
recesses
of
the
world
often
comes
across
such
an
amazing
story
as
the
adventures
of
this
couple
on
rainbow
island
he
readily
explained
the
creation
of
quarry
and
cave
by
telling
them
of
the
vein
of
antimony
embedded
in
the
rock
near
the
fault
antimony
is
one
of
the
substances
that
covers
a
multitude
of
doubts
no
one
not
excepting
the
doctors
who
use
it
knows
much
about
it
and
in
chinese
medicine
it
might
be
a
chief
factor
of
exceeding
nastiness
inside
the
cavern
the
existence
of
the
partially
completed
shaft
to
the
ledge
accounted
for
recent
disturbances
on
the
face
of
the
rock
and
could
not
of
course
distinguish
the
bones
of
poor
as
being
the
remains
of
a
european
anstruther
was
satisfied
that
none
of
them
hazarded
the
remotest
guess
as
to
the
value
of
the
gaunt
rock
they
were
staring
at
and
chance
helped
him
to
baffle
further
inquiry
a
trumpeter
on
board
the
was
blowing
his
lungs
out
to
summon
them
to
luncheon
when
captain
fitzroy
put
a
final
query
i
can
quite
understand
he
said
to
robert
that
you
have
an
affection
for
this
weird
place
i
should
think
so
indeed
muttered
the
stout
midshipman
glancing
at
iris
but
i
am
curious
to
know
continued
the
commander
why
you
lay
claim
to
the
island
you
can
hardly
intend
to
return
here
he
pointed
to
robert
placard
stuck
on
the
rock
anstruther
paused
before
he
answered
he
felt
that
lord
ventnor
dark
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
everybody
was
more
or
less
desirous
to
have
this
point
cleared
up
he
looked
the
questioner
squarely
in
the
face
in
some
parts
of
the
world
he
said
there
are
sunken
reefs
unknown
uncharted
on
which
many
a
vessel
has
been
lost
without
any
contributory
fault
on
the
part
of
her
officers
undoubtedly
well
captain
fitzroy
when
i
was
stationed
with
my
regiment
in
hong
kong
i
encountered
such
a
reef
and
wrecked
my
life
on
it
at
least
that
is
how
it
seemed
to
me
then
fortune
threw
me
ashore
here
after
a
long
and
bitter
submergence
you
can
hardly
blame
me
if
i
cling
to
the
tiny
speck
of
land
that
gave
me
salvation
no
admitted
the
sailor
he
knew
there
was
something
more
in
the
allegory
than
the
text
revealed
but
it
was
no
business
of
his
moreover
continued
robert
smilingly
you
see
i
have
a
partner
there
can
not
be
the
slightest
doubt
about
the
partner
was
the
prompt
reply
then
every
one
laughed
iris
more
than
any
though
sir
arthur
gaiety
was
forced
and
lord
ventnor
could
taste
the
acidity
of
his
own
smile
later
in
the
day
the
first
lieutenant
told
his
chief
of
voluntary
statement
concerning
the
captain
fitzroy
was
naturally
pained
by
this
unpleasant
revelation
but
he
took
exactly
the
same
view
as
that
expressed
by
the
first
lieutenant
in
presence
nevertheless
he
pondered
the
matter
and
seized
an
early
opportunity
of
mentioning
it
to
lord
ventnor
that
distinguished
nobleman
was
vastly
surprised
to
learn
how
anstruther
had
cut
the
ground
from
beneath
his
feet
yes
he
said
in
reply
to
the
sailor
request
for
information
i
know
all
about
it
it
could
not
well
be
otherwise
seeing
that
next
to
costobell
i
was
the
principal
witness
against
him
that
must
have
been
d
d
awkward
for
you
was
the
unexpected
comment
indeed
why
because
rumor
linked
your
name
with
that
of
the
lady
in
a
somewhat
outspoken
way
you
astonish
me
anstruther
certainly
made
some
stupid
allegations
during
the
trial
but
i
had
no
idea
he
was
able
to
spread
this
malicious
report
subsequently
i
am
not
talking
of
hong
kong
my
lord
but
of
singapore
months
later
captain
fitzroy
tone
was
exceedingly
dry
indeed
some
people
might
deem
it
offensive
his
lordship
permitted
himself
the
rare
luxury
of
an
angry
scowl
rumor
is
a
lying
jade
at
the
best
he
said
curtly
you
must
remember
captain
fitzroy
that
i
have
uttered
no
word
of
scandal
about
anstruther
and
any
doubts
concerning
his
conduct
can
be
set
at
rest
by
perusing
the
records
of
his
case
in
the
office
at
hong
kong
hum
said
the
sailor
turning
on
his
heel
to
enter
the
this
was
no
way
to
treat
a
real
live
lord
a
personage
of
some
political
importance
too
such
as
the
special
envoy
to
wang
hai
evidently
iris
was
no
mean
advocate
she
had
already
won
for
the
outcast
the
suffrages
of
the
entire
ship
company
the
girl
and
her
father
went
back
to
the
island
with
robert
after
taking
thought
the
latter
decided
to
ask
mir
jan
to
remain
in
possession
until
he
returned
there
was
not
much
risk
of
another
dyak
invasion
the
fate
of
taung
expedition
would
not
encourage
a
fresh
set
of
marauders
and
the
mahommedan
would
be
well
armed
to
meet
unforeseen
contingencies
whilst
on
his
anstruther
representations
the
would
land
an
abundance
of
stores
in
any
event
it
was
better
for
the
native
to
live
in
freedom
on
rainbow
island
than
to
be
handed
over
to
the
authorities
as
an
escaped
convict
which
must
be
his
immediate
fate
no
matter
what
magnanimous
view
the
government
of
india
might
afterwards
take
of
his
services
mir
jan
answer
was
emphatic
he
took
off
his
turban
and
placed
it
on
anstruther
feet
sahib
he
said
i
am
your
dog
if
some
day
i
am
found
worthy
to
be
your
faithful
servant
then
shall
i
know
that
allah
has
pardoned
my
transgressions
i
only
killed
a
man
because
peace
mir
let
him
rest
why
is
he
worshiping
you
robert
demanded
iris
he
told
her
really
she
cried
i
must
keep
up
my
studies
in
hindustani
it
is
quite
too
sweet
and
then
for
the
benefit
of
her
father
she
rattled
off
into
a
spirited
account
of
her
struggles
with
the
algebraic
x
and
the
urdu
compound
verb
sir
arthur
deane
managed
to
repress
a
sigh
in
spite
of
himself
he
could
not
help
liking
anstruther
the
man
was
magnetic
a
hero
an
ideal
gentleman
no
wonder
his
daughter
was
infatuated
with
him
yet
the
future
was
dark
and
full
of
sinister
threats
and
complications
iris
did
not
know
the
wretched
circumstances
which
had
come
to
pass
since
they
parted
and
which
had
changed
the
whole
aspect
of
his
life
how
could
he
tell
her
why
should
it
be
his
miserable
lot
to
snatch
the
cup
of
happiness
from
her
lips
in
that
moment
of
silent
agony
he
wished
he
were
dead
for
death
alone
could
remove
the
burthen
laid
on
him
well
surely
he
might
bask
in
the
sunshine
of
her
laughter
for
another
day
no
need
to
embitter
her
joyous
heart
until
he
was
driven
to
it
by
dire
necessity
so
he
resolutely
brushed
aside
the
phantom
of
care
and
entered
into
the
of
the
hour
with
a
zest
that
delighted
her
the
dear
girl
imagined
that
robert
her
robert
had
made
another
speedy
conquest
and
anstruther
himself
was
much
elated
by
the
sudden
change
in
sir
arthur
deane
demeanor
they
behaved
like
school
children
on
a
picnic
they
roared
over
troubles
in
the
matter
of
divided
skirts
too
much
divided
to
be
at
all
pleasant
the
shipowner
tasted
some
of
her
sago
bread
and
vowed
it
was
excellent
they
unearthed
two
bottles
of
champagne
the
last
of
the
case
and
promised
each
other
a
hearty
toast
at
dinner
nothing
would
content
iris
but
that
they
should
draw
a
farewell
bucketful
of
water
from
the
well
and
drench
the
with
a
torrential
shower
robert
carefully
secured
the
money
and
other
effects
found
on
their
dead
companions
the
baronet
of
course
knew
all
the
principal
officers
of
the
he
surveyed
these
mournful
relics
with
sorrowful
interest
the
was
the
crack
ship
of
my
fleet
and
captain
ross
my
most
trusted
commander
he
said
you
may
well
imagine
anstruther
what
a
cruel
blow
it
was
to
lose
such
a
vessel
with
all
these
people
on
board
and
my
only
daughter
amongst
them
i
wonder
now
that
it
did
not
kill
me
she
was
a
splendid
sir
although
disabled
she
fought
gallantly
against
the
typhoon
nothing
short
of
a
reef
would
break
her
up
ah
well
sighed
the
shipowner
the
few
timbers
you
have
shown
me
here
are
the
remaining
assets
out
of
was
she
not
insured
inquired
robert
no
that
is
i
have
recently
adopted
a
scheme
of
mutual
and
the
loss
falls
on
my
other
vessels
the
baronet
glanced
covertly
at
iris
the
words
conveyed
little
meaning
to
her
indeed
she
broke
in
with
a
laugh
i
am
afraid
i
have
heard
you
say
father
dear
that
some
ships
in
the
fleet
paid
you
best
when
they
ran
ashore
yes
iris
that
often
happened
in
the
old
days
it
is
different
now
moreover
i
have
not
told
you
the
extent
of
my
calamities
the
was
lost
on
march
though
i
did
not
know
it
for
certain
until
this
morning
but
on
march
the
was
sunk
in
the
mersey
during
a
fog
and
three
days
later
the
turned
turtle
on
the
james
and
mary
shoal
in
the
hooghly
happily
there
were
no
lives
lost
in
either
of
these
cases
even
iris
was
appalled
by
this
list
of
casualties
my
poor
dear
dad
she
cried
to
think
that
all
these
troubles
should
occur
the
very
moment
i
left
you
yet
she
gave
no
thought
to
the
serious
financial
effect
of
such
a
string
of
catastrophes
robert
of
course
appreciated
this
side
of
the
business
especially
in
view
of
the
shipowner
remark
about
the
insurance
but
sir
arthur
deane
stiff
upper
lip
deceived
him
he
failed
to
realize
that
the
father
was
acting
a
part
for
his
sake
oddly
enough
the
baronet
did
not
seek
to
discuss
with
them
the
document
affixed
near
the
cave
it
claimed
all
rights
in
the
island
in
their
joint
names
and
this
was
a
topic
he
wished
to
avoid
for
the
time
therefore
the
younger
man
had
no
opportunity
of
taking
him
into
his
confidence
and
iris
held
faithfully
to
her
promise
of
silence
the
girl
ragged
raiment
and
strong
boots
were
already
packed
away
on
board
she
now
rescued
the
bible
the
copy
of
poems
the
battered
tin
cup
her
revolver
and
the
which
scared
the
dyaks
when
they
nearly
caught
anstruther
and
mir
jan
napping
robert
also
gathered
for
her
an
assortment
of
dyak
hats
belts
and
arms
including
taung
parang
and
a
sumpitan
these
were
her
trophies
the
of
the
campaign
his
concluding
act
was
to
pack
two
of
the
empty
oil
tins
with
all
the
valuable
lumps
of
auriferous
quartz
he
could
find
where
he
shot
the
rubbish
from
the
cave
beneath
the
trees
on
top
of
these
he
placed
some
antimony
ore
and
mir
jan
wondering
why
the
sahib
wanted
the
stuff
carried
the
consignment
to
the
waiting
boat
lieutenant
playdon
in
command
of
the
last
party
of
sailors
to
quit
the
island
evidently
expected
mir
jan
to
accompany
them
but
anstruther
explained
that
the
man
would
await
his
return
some
time
in
june
or
july
sir
arthur
deane
found
himself
speculating
on
the
cause
of
this
extraordinary
resolve
but
steadfast
to
his
policy
of
avoiding
controversial
matters
said
nothing
a
few
words
to
the
captain
procured
enough
stores
to
keep
the
mahommedan
for
six
months
at
least
and
whilst
these
were
being
landed
the
question
was
raised
how
best
to
dispose
of
the
dyaks
the
commander
wished
to
consult
the
convenience
of
his
guests
if
we
go
a
little
out
of
our
way
and
land
them
in
borneo
he
said
they
will
be
hanged
without
troubling
you
further
if
i
take
them
to
singapore
they
will
be
tried
on
your
evidence
and
sent
to
penal
servitude
which
is
it
to
be
it
was
iris
who
decided
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
more
lives
being
sacrificed
she
protested
perhaps
if
these
men
are
treated
mercifully
and
sent
to
their
homes
after
some
punishment
their
example
may
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
others
so
it
was
settled
that
way
the
anchor
rattled
up
to
its
berth
and
the
turned
her
head
towards
singapore
as
she
steadily
passed
away
into
the
deepening
azure
the
girl
and
her
lover
watched
the
familiar
outlines
of
rainbow
island
growing
dim
in
the
evening
light
for
a
long
while
they
could
see
mir
jan
tall
thin
figure
motionless
on
a
rock
at
the
extremity
of
europa
point
their
hut
the
reef
the
ledge
came
into
view
as
the
cruiser
swung
round
to
a
more
northerly
course
iris
had
thrown
an
arm
across
her
father
shoulders
the
three
were
left
alone
just
then
and
they
were
silent
for
many
minutes
at
last
the
flying
miles
merged
the
solitary
palm
beyond
the
lagoon
with
the
foliage
on
the
cliff
the
wide
cleft
of
prospect
park
grew
less
distinct
mir
jan
figure
was
lost
in
the
dark
background
the
island
was
becoming
vague
a
blurred
memory
robert
said
the
girl
devoutly
god
has
been
very
good
to
us
yes
he
replied
i
was
thinking
even
this
instant
of
the
verse
that
is
carved
on
the
gate
of
the
memorial
well
at
cawnpore
are
they
which
came
out
of
great
tribulation
we
too
have
come
out
of
great
tribulation
happily
with
our
lives
and
more
the
decrees
of
fate
are
indeed
inscrutable
iris
turned
to
him
a
face
roseate
with
loving
comprehension
do
you
remember
this
hour
yesterday
she
murmured
how
we
suffered
from
thirst
how
the
dyaks
began
their
second
attack
from
the
ridge
how
you
climbed
down
the
ladder
and
i
followed
you
oh
father
darling
she
went
on
impulsively
tightening
her
grasp
you
will
never
know
how
brave
he
was
how
enduring
how
he
risked
all
for
me
and
cheered
me
to
the
end
even
though
the
end
seemed
to
be
the
grave
i
think
i
am
beginning
to
understand
now
answered
the
shipowner
averting
his
eyes
lest
iris
should
see
the
tears
in
them
their
calvary
was
ended
they
thought
was
it
for
him
to
lead
them
again
through
the
sorrowful
way
it
was
a
heartrending
task
that
lay
before
him
a
task
from
which
his
soul
revolted
he
refused
even
to
attempt
it
he
sought
forgetfulness
in
a
species
of
mental
intoxication
and
countenanced
his
daughter
love
idyll
with
such
apparent
approval
that
lord
ventnor
wondered
whether
sir
arthur
were
not
suffering
from
senile
decay
the
explanation
of
the
shipowner
position
was
painfully
simple
being
a
daring
yet
shrewd
financier
he
perceived
in
the
troubled
condition
of
the
far
east
a
magnificent
opportunity
to
consolidate
the
trading
influence
of
his
company
he
negotiated
two
big
loans
one
of
a
nature
to
equip
docks
and
railways
in
the
chief
maritime
province
of
china
the
other
of
a
more
public
character
with
the
government
of
japan
all
his
own
resources
together
with
those
of
his
principal
directors
and
shareholders
were
devoted
to
these
objects
contemporaneously
he
determined
to
stop
paying
heavy
insurance
premiums
on
his
fleet
and
make
it
on
the
mutual
principle
his
vessels
were
well
equipped
well
manned
replete
with
every
modern
improvement
and
managed
with
great
commercial
skill
in
three
or
four
years
given
ordinary
trading
luck
he
must
have
doubled
his
own
fortune
and
earned
a
reputation
for
sagacity
no
sooner
were
all
his
arrangements
completed
than
three
of
his
best
ships
went
down
saddling
his
company
with
an
absolute
loss
of
nearly
and
seriously
undermining
his
financial
credit
a
wealthy
and
influential
resigned
his
seat
on
the
board
and
headed
a
clique
of
disappointed
stockholders
at
once
the
fair
sky
became
overcast
a
sound
and
magnificent
speculation
threatened
to
dissolve
in
the
bankruptcy
court
sir
arthur
deane
energy
and
financial
skill
might
have
enabled
him
to
weather
this
unexpected
gale
were
it
not
for
the
apparent
loss
of
his
beloved
daughter
with
the
crack
ship
of
his
line
with
grief
he
bade
his
enemies
do
their
worst
and
allowed
his
affairs
to
get
into
hopeless
confusion
whilst
he
devoted
himself
wholly
to
the
search
for
iris
and
her
companions
at
this
critical
juncture
lord
ventnor
again
reached
his
side
his
lordship
possessed
a
large
private
fortune
and
extensive
estates
he
was
prudent
withal
and
knew
how
admirably
the
shipowner
plans
would
develop
if
given
the
necessary
time
he
offered
the
use
of
his
name
and
money
he
more
than
filled
the
gap
created
by
the
hostile
people
argued
that
such
a
clever
man
just
returning
from
the
far
east
after
accomplishing
a
public
mission
of
some
importance
must
be
a
reliable
guide
the
mere
cabled
intelligence
of
his
intention
to
join
the
board
restored
confidence
and
credit
but
there
was
a
bargain
if
iris
lived
she
must
become
the
countess
of
ventnor
his
lordship
was
weary
of
peripatetic
it
was
high
time
he
settled
down
in
life
took
an
interest
in
the
legislature
and
achieved
a
position
in
the
world
of
affairs
he
had
a
chance
now
the
certain
success
of
his
friend
project
the
fortunate
completion
of
his
own
diplomatic
undertaking
marriage
with
a
beautiful
and
charming
woman
these
items
would
consolidate
his
career
if
iris
were
not
available
plenty
of
women
in
society
would
accept
such
an
eligible
bachelor
but
his
heart
was
set
on
iris
she
was
honest
pure
in
body
and
mind
and
none
prizes
these
essentials
in
a
wife
more
than
a
he
seized
the
first
opportunity
that
presented
itself
to
make
sir
arthur
deane
acquainted
with
a
decision
already
dreaded
by
the
unfortunate
shipowner
iris
must
either
abandon
her
infatuation
for
anstruther
or
bring
about
the
ruin
of
her
father
there
was
no
mean
if
she
declines
to
become
countess
of
ventnor
she
can
marry
whom
she
likes
as
you
will
be
all
paupers
together
was
the
earl
caustic
summing
up
this
brutal
argument
rather
overshot
the
mark
the
shipowner
face
flushed
with
anger
and
lord
ventnor
hastened
to
retrieve
a
false
step
i
did
exactly
mean
to
put
it
that
way
deane
but
my
temper
is
a
little
short
these
days
my
position
on
board
this
ship
is
intolerable
as
a
matter
of
fair
dealing
to
me
you
should
put
a
stop
to
your
daughter
attitude
towards
anstruther
on
the
ground
that
her
engagement
is
neither
approved
of
by
you
nor
desirable
under
any
consideration
it
may
be
assumed
from
this
remark
that
even
the
earl
sardonic
temper
was
ruffled
by
the
girl
outrageous
behavior
nor
was
it
exactly
pleasant
to
him
to
note
how
steadily
anstruther
advanced
in
the
favor
of
every
officer
on
the
ship
by
tacit
consent
the
was
tabooed
at
any
rate
until
the
reached
singapore
every
one
knew
that
the
quarrel
lay
between
robert
and
ventnor
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
iris
influence
alone
were
sufficient
to
turn
the
scale
in
favor
of
her
lover
the
shipowner
refused
to
interfere
in
any
way
during
the
voyage
you
promised
your
in
business
even
if
we
found
that
the
had
gone
down
with
all
hands
he
retorted
bitterly
do
you
wish
me
to
make
my
daughter
believe
she
has
come
back
into
my
life
only
to
bring
me
irretrievable
ruin
that
appears
to
be
the
result
no
matter
how
you
may
endeavor
to
disguise
it
i
thought
the
days
were
gone
when
a
man
would
wish
to
marry
a
woman
against
her
will
nonsense
what
does
she
know
about
it
the
glamour
of
this
island
romance
will
soon
wear
off
it
would
be
different
if
anstruther
were
able
to
maintain
her
even
decently
he
is
an
absolute
beggar
i
tell
you
did
he
ship
on
your
own
vessel
as
a
steward
take
my
tip
deane
tell
him
how
matters
stand
with
you
and
he
will
cool
off
he
believed
nothing
of
the
sort
but
he
was
desperately
anxious
that
iris
should
learn
the
truth
as
to
her
father
dilemma
from
other
lips
than
his
own
this
would
be
the
first
point
gained
others
would
follow
the
two
men
were
conversing
in
the
earl
cabin
on
the
deck
overhead
a
very
different
chat
was
taking
place
the
was
due
in
singapore
that
afternoon
iris
was
invited
into
the
on
some
pretext
and
lieutenant
playdon
delegated
by
the
commander
and
the
first
lieutenant
buttonholed
robert
with
directness
he
came
straight
to
the
point
a
few
of
us
have
been
talking
about
you
anstruther
and
we
can
not
be
far
wrong
in
assuming
that
you
are
hard
up
the
fact
that
you
took
a
steward
job
on
the
shows
your
disinclination
to
appeal
to
your
own
people
for
funds
now
once
you
are
ashore
you
will
be
landed
in
difficulties
to
cut
any
further
explanations
i
am
commissioned
to
offer
you
a
loan
of
fifty
pounds
which
you
can
repay
when
you
like
robert
mouth
tightened
somewhat
for
the
moment
he
could
not
find
words
playdon
feared
he
was
offended
i
am
sorry
old
chap
if
we
are
mistaken
he
said
hesitatingly
but
we
really
thought
please
do
not
endeavor
to
explain
away
your
generous
act
exclaimed
anstruther
i
accept
it
thankfully
on
one
condition
blow
the
condition
but
what
is
it
that
you
tell
me
the
names
of
those
to
whom
i
am
indebted
besides
yourself
oh
that
is
easy
enough
fitzroy
and
the
first
luff
are
the
others
we
kept
it
to
a
small
circle
do
you
know
thought
you
would
prefer
that
anstruther
smiled
and
wrung
his
hand
there
were
some
good
fellows
left
in
the
world
after
all
the
three
officers
acted
in
pure
good
nature
they
were
assisting
a
man
apparently
down
in
his
luck
who
would
soon
be
called
on
to
face
other
difficulties
by
reason
of
his
engagement
to
a
girl
apparently
so
far
removed
from
him
in
station
and
the
last
thing
they
dreamed
of
was
that
their
kindly
loan
was
destined
to
yield
them
a
better
return
than
all
the
years
of
their
naval
service
for
their
fifty
pounds
had
gone
into
the
pocket
of
a
potential
millionaire
who
was
endowed
with
the
faculty
rare
in
millionaires
of
not
forgetting
the
friends
of
his
days
chapter
xvii
rainbow
island
again
and
afterward
sir
arthur
deane
was
sitting
alone
in
his
cabin
in
a
state
of
deep
dejection
when
he
was
aroused
by
a
knock
and
robert
entered
can
you
give
me
half
an
hour
he
asked
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
before
we
land
the
shipowner
silently
motioned
him
to
a
seat
it
concerns
iris
and
myself
continued
anstruther
i
gathered
from
your
words
when
we
met
on
the
island
that
both
you
and
lord
ventnor
regarded
iris
as
his
lordship
promised
bride
from
your
point
of
view
the
arrangement
was
perhaps
natural
and
equitable
but
since
your
daughter
left
hong
kong
it
happens
that
she
and
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
no
please
listen
to
me
i
am
not
here
to
urge
my
claims
on
you
i
won
her
fairly
and
intend
to
keep
her
were
the
whole
house
of
peers
opposed
to
me
at
this
moment
i
want
to
tell
you
her
father
why
she
could
never
even
under
other
circumstances
marry
lord
ventnor
then
he
proceeded
to
place
before
the
astounded
baronet
a
detailed
history
of
his
recent
career
it
was
a
sordid
story
of
woman
perfidy
twice
told
it
carried
conviction
in
every
sentence
it
was
possible
of
course
to
explain
matters
more
fully
to
the
baronet
than
to
iris
and
anstruther
fierce
resentment
of
the
cruel
wrong
inflicted
upon
him
blazed
forth
with
overwhelming
force
the
intensity
of
his
wrath
in
no
way
impaired
the
cogency
of
his
arguments
rather
did
it
lend
point
and
logical
brevity
each
word
burned
itself
into
his
consciousness
for
robert
did
not
know
that
the
unfortunate
father
was
being
coerced
to
a
distasteful
compact
by
the
scoundrel
who
figured
in
the
narrative
as
his
evil
genius
at
the
conclusion
sir
arthur
bowed
his
head
between
his
hands
i
can
not
choose
but
believe
you
he
admitted
huskily
yet
how
came
you
to
be
so
unjustly
convicted
by
a
tribunal
composed
of
your
brother
officers
they
could
not
help
themselves
to
acquit
me
meant
that
they
discredited
the
sworn
testimony
not
only
of
my
colonel
wife
but
of
the
civil
head
of
an
important
government
mission
not
to
mention
some
bought
chinese
evidence
am
i
the
first
man
to
be
offered
up
as
a
sacrifice
on
the
altar
of
official
expediency
but
you
are
powerless
now
you
can
hardly
hope
to
have
your
case
revised
what
chance
is
there
that
your
name
will
ever
be
cleared
costobell
can
do
it
if
she
will
the
vagaries
of
such
a
woman
are
not
to
be
depended
on
if
lord
ventnor
has
cast
her
off
her
hatred
may
stronger
than
her
passion
anyhow
i
should
be
the
last
man
to
despair
of
god
providence
compare
the
condition
of
iris
and
myself
today
with
our
plight
during
the
second
night
on
the
ledge
i
refuse
to
believe
that
a
bad
and
fickle
woman
can
resist
the
workings
of
destiny
and
it
was
a
happy
fate
which
led
me
to
ship
on
board
the
though
at
the
time
i
saw
it
in
another
light
how
different
the
words
the
aspirations
of
the
two
suitors
quite
unconsciously
robert
could
not
have
pleaded
better
the
shipowner
sighed
heavily
i
hope
your
faith
will
be
justified
if
it
be
not
the
more
likely
thing
to
happen
do
i
understand
that
my
daughter
and
you
intend
to
get
married
whether
i
give
or
withhold
my
sanction
anstruther
rose
and
opened
the
door
i
have
ventured
to
tell
you
he
said
why
she
should
not
marry
lord
ventnor
when
i
come
to
you
and
ask
you
for
her
which
i
pray
may
be
soon
it
will
be
time
enough
to
answer
that
question
should
you
then
decide
to
put
it
it
must
be
remembered
that
robert
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
older
man
predicament
whilst
the
baronet
full
of
his
own
troubles
was
in
no
mood
to
take
a
reasonable
view
of
anstruther
position
neither
iris
nor
robert
could
make
him
understand
the
duel
of
their
early
life
on
the
island
nor
was
it
easy
to
depict
the
tumultuous
agony
of
that
terrible
hour
on
the
ledge
when
the
girl
forced
the
man
to
confess
his
love
by
suggesting
acceptance
of
the
dyaks
terms
thus
for
a
little
while
these
two
were
driven
apart
and
anstruther
disdained
to
urge
the
plea
that
not
many
weeks
would
elapse
before
he
would
be
a
richer
man
than
his
rival
the
chief
sufferer
was
sir
arthur
deane
had
iris
guessed
how
her
father
was
tormented
she
would
not
have
remained
on
the
bridge
radiant
and
mirthful
whilst
the
baronet
gazed
with
despair
at
some
memoranda
which
he
extracted
from
his
papers
ten
thousand
pounds
he
muttered
not
a
great
sum
for
the
millionaire
financier
sir
arthur
deane
to
raise
on
his
note
of
hand
a
few
months
ago
men
offered
me
one
hundred
times
the
amount
on
no
better
security
and
now
to
think
that
a
set
of
jabbering
fools
in
london
should
so
destroy
my
credit
and
their
own
that
not
a
bank
will
discount
our
paper
unless
they
are
assured
lord
ventnor
has
joined
the
board
fancy
me
of
all
men
being
willing
to
barter
my
child
for
a
few
pieces
of
gold
the
thought
was
maddening
for
a
little
while
he
yielded
to
utter
despondency
it
was
quite
true
that
a
comparatively
small
amount
of
money
would
restore
the
stability
of
his
firm
even
without
it
were
his
credit
unimpaired
he
could
easily
tide
over
the
period
of
depression
until
the
first
fruits
of
his
enterprise
were
garnered
then
all
men
would
hail
him
as
a
genius
wearily
turning
over
his
papers
he
suddenly
came
across
the
last
letter
written
to
him
by
iris
mother
how
she
doted
on
their
only
child
he
recalled
one
night
shortly
before
his
wife
died
when
the
little
iris
was
brought
into
her
room
to
kiss
her
and
lisp
her
infantile
prayers
she
had
devised
a
formula
of
her
own
god
bless
father
god
bless
mother
god
bless
me
their
little
girl
and
what
was
it
she
cried
to
him
from
the
beach
your
own
little
girl
given
back
to
you
given
back
to
him
for
what
to
marry
that
scoundrel
whose
pastime
was
the
degradation
of
women
and
the
defaming
of
honest
men
that
settled
it
instantly
the
cloud
was
lifted
from
his
soul
a
great
peace
came
upon
him
the
ruin
of
his
business
he
might
not
be
able
to
avert
but
he
would
save
from
the
wreck
that
which
he
prized
more
than
all
else
his
daughter
love
the
engines
dropped
to
half
speed
they
were
entering
the
harbor
of
singapore
in
a
few
hours
the
worst
would
be
over
if
ventnor
telegraphed
to
london
his
withdrawal
from
the
board
nothing
short
of
a
cabled
draft
for
ten
thousand
pounds
would
prevent
certain
creditors
from
filing
a
bankruptcy
petition
in
the
local
banks
the
baronet
had
about
a
thousand
to
his
credit
surely
among
the
rich
merchants
of
the
port
men
who
knew
the
potentialities
of
his
scheme
he
would
be
able
to
raise
the
money
needed
he
would
try
hard
already
he
felt
braver
the
old
fire
had
returned
to
his
blood
the
very
belief
that
he
was
acting
in
the
way
best
calculated
to
secure
his
daughter
happiness
stimulated
and
encouraged
him
he
went
on
deck
to
meet
iris
skipping
down
the
hatchway
oh
there
you
are
she
cried
i
was
just
coming
to
find
out
why
you
were
moping
in
your
cabin
you
are
missing
the
most
beautiful
view
all
greens
and
blues
and
browns
run
quick
i
want
you
to
see
every
inch
of
it
she
held
out
her
hand
and
pulled
him
gleefully
up
the
steps
leaning
against
the
taffrail
some
distance
apart
from
each
other
were
anstruther
and
lord
ventnor
need
it
be
said
to
whom
iris
drew
her
father
here
he
is
robert
she
laughed
i
do
believe
he
was
sulking
because
captain
fitzroy
was
so
very
attentive
to
me
yet
you
did
mind
it
a
bit
the
two
men
looked
into
each
other
eyes
they
smiled
how
could
they
resist
the
contagion
of
her
sunny
nature
i
have
been
thinking
over
what
you
said
to
me
just
now
anstruther
said
the
shipowner
slowly
oh
cried
iris
have
you
two
been
talking
secrets
behind
my
back
it
is
no
secret
to
you
my
little
girl
her
father
voice
lingered
on
the
phrase
when
we
are
on
shore
robert
i
will
explain
matters
to
you
more
fully
just
now
i
wish
only
to
tell
you
that
where
iris
has
given
her
heart
i
will
not
refuse
her
hand
you
darling
old
dad
and
is
that
what
all
the
mystery
was
about
she
took
his
face
between
her
hands
and
kissed
him
lord
ventnor
wondering
at
this
effusiveness
strolled
forward
what
has
happened
miss
deane
he
inquired
have
you
just
discovered
what
an
excellent
parent
you
possess
the
baronet
laughed
almost
hysterically
my
honor
he
cried
you
could
not
have
hit
upon
a
happier
explanation
his
lordship
was
not
quite
satisfied
i
suppose
you
will
take
iris
to
smith
hotel
he
said
with
cool
impudence
iris
answered
him
yes
my
father
has
just
asked
robert
to
come
with
us
by
inference
that
is
where
are
you
going
the
adroit
use
of
her
lover
christian
name
goaded
his
lordship
to
sudden
heat
indeed
he
snarled
sir
arthur
deane
has
evidently
decided
a
good
many
things
during
the
last
hour
yes
was
the
shipowner
quiet
retort
i
have
decided
that
my
daughter
happiness
should
be
the
chief
consideration
of
my
remaining
years
all
else
must
give
way
to
it
the
earl
swarthy
face
grew
sallow
with
fury
his
eyes
blazed
and
there
was
a
tense
vibrato
in
his
voice
as
he
said
then
i
must
congratulate
you
miss
deane
you
are
fated
to
endure
adventures
having
escaped
from
the
melodramatic
perils
of
rainbow
island
you
are
destined
to
experience
another
variety
of
shipwreck
here
he
left
them
not
a
word
had
robert
spoken
throughout
the
unexpected
scene
his
heart
was
throbbing
with
a
tremulous
joy
and
his
sneers
were
lost
on
him
but
he
could
not
fail
to
note
the
malignant
purpose
of
the
parting
sentence
in
his
quietly
masterful
way
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
what
did
lord
ventnor
mean
he
asked
sir
arthur
deane
answered
with
a
calm
smile
it
is
difficult
to
talk
openly
at
this
moment
wait
until
we
reach
the
hotel
the
news
flew
fast
through
the
settlement
that
had
returned
from
her
long
search
for
the
the
warship
occupied
her
usual
anchorage
and
a
boat
was
lowered
to
take
off
the
passengers
lieutenant
playdon
went
ashore
with
them
a
feeling
of
consideration
for
anstruther
prevented
any
arrangements
being
made
for
subsequent
meetings
once
their
courteous
duty
was
ended
the
officers
of
the
could
not
give
him
any
further
social
recognition
lord
ventnor
was
aware
of
this
fact
and
endeavored
to
turn
it
to
advantage
by
the
way
fitzroy
he
called
out
to
the
commander
as
he
prepared
to
descend
the
gangway
i
want
you
and
any
others
not
detained
by
duty
to
come
and
dine
with
me
tonight
captain
fitzroy
answered
blandly
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
ask
us
but
i
fear
i
can
not
make
any
definite
arrangements
until
i
learn
what
orders
are
awaiting
me
here
oh
certainly
come
if
you
can
eh
yes
suppose
we
leave
it
at
that
it
was
a
polite
but
decided
rebuff
it
in
no
way
tended
to
sweeten
lord
ventnor
temper
which
was
further
exasperated
when
he
hurt
his
shin
against
one
of
robert
tins
with
its
accumulation
of
debris
the
boat
swung
off
into
the
tideway
her
progress
shorewards
was
watched
by
a
small
knot
of
people
mostly
loungers
and
coolies
among
them
however
were
two
persons
who
had
driven
rapidly
to
the
when
the
arrival
of
the
was
reported
one
bore
all
the
distinguishing
marks
of
the
army
officer
of
high
rank
but
the
other
was
unmistakably
a
globetrotter
only
in
piccadilly
could
he
have
purchased
his
wondrous
or
pith
helmet
with
its
imitation
neatly
frilled
and
puckered
and
no
tailor
who
ever
carried
his
goose
through
the
exile
gate
would
have
fashioned
his
expensive
garments
but
the
old
gentleman
made
no
pretence
that
he
could
hear
the
east
he
swore
impartially
at
the
climate
the
place
and
its
inhabitants
at
this
instant
he
was
in
a
state
of
wild
excitement
he
was
very
tall
very
stout
exceedingly
any
budding
medico
who
understood
the
enjoyed
by
in
a
prescription
would
have
diagnosed
him
as
a
subject
for
apoplexy
producing
a
tremendous
telescope
he
vainly
endeavored
to
balance
it
on
the
shoulder
of
a
native
servant
ca
you
stand
still
you
blithering
idiot
he
shouted
after
futile
attempts
to
focus
the
advancing
boat
or
shall
i
steady
you
by
a
clout
over
the
ear
his
companion
the
army
man
was
looking
through
a
pair
of
by
jove
he
cried
i
can
see
sir
arthur
deane
and
a
girl
who
looks
like
his
daughter
there
that
infernal
scamp
ventnor
too
the
big
man
brushed
the
servant
out
of
his
way
and
brandished
the
telescope
as
though
it
were
a
bludgeon
the
dirty
beggar
he
drove
my
lad
to
misery
and
death
yet
he
has
come
back
safe
and
sound
wait
till
i
meet
him
i
now
anstruther
remember
your
promise
i
will
deal
with
lord
ventnor
my
vengeance
has
first
claim
what
by
the
jumping
moses
i
do
believe
yes
it
is
anstruther
your
nephew
is
sitting
next
to
the
girl
the
telescope
fell
on
the
stones
with
a
crash
the
giant
rubicund
face
suddenly
blanched
he
leaned
on
his
friend
for
support
you
are
not
mistaken
he
almost
whimpered
look
again
for
sake
man
make
sure
before
you
speak
tell
me
tell
me
calm
yourself
anstruther
it
is
robert
as
sure
as
i
alive
you
think
i
know
him
my
poor
disgraced
friend
whom
i
like
all
the
rest
cast
off
in
his
hour
of
trouble
but
i
had
some
excuse
there
there
i
did
mean
that
old
fellow
robert
himself
will
be
the
last
man
to
blame
either
of
us
who
could
have
suspected
that
two
people
one
of
them
god
help
me
my
wife
would
concoct
such
a
hellish
plot
the
boat
glided
gracefully
alongside
the
steps
of
the
quay
and
playdon
sprang
ashore
to
help
iris
to
alight
what
happened
immediately
afterwards
can
best
be
told
in
his
own
words
as
he
retailed
the
story
to
an
appreciative
audience
in
the
we
had
just
landed
he
said
and
some
of
the
crew
were
pushing
the
coolies
out
of
the
way
when
two
men
jumped
down
the
steps
and
a
most
fiendish
row
sprang
up
that
is
there
was
no
dispute
or
wrangling
but
one
chap
who
it
turned
out
was
colonel
costobell
grabbed
ventnor
by
the
shirt
front
and
threatened
to
smash
his
face
in
if
he
listen
then
and
there
to
what
he
had
to
say
i
really
thought
about
interfering
until
i
heard
colonel
costobell
opening
words
after
that
i
would
gladly
have
seen
the
beggar
chucked
into
the
harbor
we
never
liked
him
did
we
ask
no
questions
pompey
but
go
ahead
with
the
yarn
growled
the
first
lieutenant
well
it
seems
that
costobell
is
dead
she
got
enteric
a
week
after
the
sailed
and
was
a
goner
in
four
days
before
she
died
she
owned
up
he
paused
with
a
base
eye
to
effect
not
a
man
moved
a
muscle
all
right
he
cried
i
will
make
no
more
false
starts
costobell
begged
her
husband
forgiveness
for
her
treatment
of
him
and
confessed
that
she
and
lord
ventnor
planned
the
affair
for
which
anstruther
was
tried
by
it
must
have
been
a
beastly
business
for
costobell
was
sweating
with
rage
though
his
words
were
icy
enough
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
ventnor
face
when
he
heard
of
the
depositions
sworn
to
and
signed
by
costobell
and
by
several
chinese
servants
whom
he
bribed
to
give
false
evidence
he
promised
to
marry
costobell
if
her
husband
died
or
in
any
event
to
bring
about
a
divorce
when
the
hong
kong
affair
had
blown
over
then
she
learnt
that
he
was
after
miss
iris
and
there
is
no
doubt
her
fury
helped
on
the
fever
costobell
said
that
for
his
wife
sake
he
would
have
kept
the
wretched
thing
secret
but
he
was
compelled
to
clear
anstruther
name
especially
as
he
came
across
the
other
old
johnnie
pompey
you
are
incoherent
with
excitement
who
is
other
old
johnnie
asked
the
first
luff
severely
did
i
tell
you
why
anstruther
uncle
of
course
a
heavy
old
swell
with
just
a
touch
of
yorkshire
in
his
tongue
i
gathered
that
he
disinherited
his
nephew
when
the
news
of
the
reached
him
then
he
relented
and
cabled
to
him
getting
no
news
he
came
east
to
look
for
him
he
met
costobell
the
day
after
the
lady
died
and
the
two
swore
the
stout
uncle
can
swear
a
treat
anyhow
they
vowed
to
be
revenged
on
ventnor
and
to
clear
anstruther
character
living
or
dead
poor
old
chap
he
cried
like
a
baby
when
he
asked
the
youngster
to
forgive
him
it
was
quite
touching
i
can
tell
you
playdon
affected
to
search
for
his
do
tell
us
or
it
will
be
worse
for
you
cried
his
mentor
give
me
time
air
a
drink
what
you
fellows
want
is
a
phonograph
let
me
see
well
costobell
shook
ventnor
off
at
last
with
the
final
observation
that
anstruther
has
been
quashed
the
next
batch
of
general
orders
will
him
in
the
regiment
and
it
rests
with
him
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
criminal
warrant
shall
be
issued
against
his
lordship
for
conspiracy
do
you
fellows
know
what
conspir
you
cuckoo
what
did
miss
deane
do
clung
to
anstruther
like
a
weeping
angel
and
kissed
everybody
all
round
when
ventnor
got
away
well
hands
off
i
mean
her
father
anstruther
and
the
stout
uncle
unfortunately
i
was
not
on
in
that
scene
but
for
some
reason
they
all
nearly
wrung
my
arm
off
and
the
men
were
so
excited
that
they
gave
the
party
a
rousing
cheer
as
their
rickshaws
went
off
in
a
bunch
will
no
christian
gentleman
get
me
a
drink
the
next
commotion
arose
in
the
hotel
when
sir
arthur
deane
seized
the
first
opportunity
to
explain
the
predicament
in
which
his
company
was
placed
and
the
blow
which
lord
ventnor
yet
had
it
in
his
power
to
deal
william
anstruther
was
an
interested
auditor
robert
would
have
spoken
but
his
uncle
restrained
him
leave
this
to
me
lad
he
exclaimed
when
i
was
coming
here
in
the
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
about
sir
arthur
scheme
and
there
should
not
be
much
difficulty
in
raising
all
the
brass
required
if
half
what
i
heard
be
true
sit
you
down
sir
arthur
and
tell
us
all
about
it
the
shipowner
required
no
second
bidding
with
the
skill
for
which
he
was
noted
he
described
his
operations
in
detail
telling
how
every
farthing
of
the
first
instalments
of
the
two
great
loans
was
paid
up
how
the
earnings
of
his
fleet
would
quickly
overtake
the
deficit
in
capital
value
caused
by
the
loss
of
the
three
ships
and
how
in
six
months
time
the
leading
financial
houses
of
london
paris
and
berlin
would
be
offering
him
more
money
than
he
would
need
to
a
shrewd
man
of
business
the
project
could
not
fail
to
commend
itself
and
the
yorkshire
squire
though
a
trifle
obstinate
in
temper
was
singularly
in
other
respects
he
brought
his
great
fist
down
on
the
table
with
a
whack
send
a
cable
to
your
company
sir
arthur
he
cried
and
tell
them
that
your
prospective
will
provide
the
ten
thousand
pounds
you
require
i
will
see
that
his
draft
is
honored
you
can
add
if
you
like
that
another
ten
will
be
ready
if
wanted
when
this
lot
is
spent
i
did
my
lad
one
d
er
deuced
bad
turn
in
my
life
this
time
i
think
i
am
doing
him
a
good
one
you
are
indeed
said
iris
father
enthusiastically
the
unallotted
capital
he
is
taking
up
will
be
worth
four
times
its
face
value
in
two
years
all
the
more
reason
to
make
his
holding
twenty
instead
of
ten
roared
the
yorkshireman
but
look
here
you
talk
about
dropping
proceedings
against
that
precious
earl
whom
i
saw
why
not
tell
him
not
to
try
any
funny
tricks
until
robert
money
is
safely
lodged
to
your
account
we
have
him
in
our
power
dash
it
all
let
us
use
him
a
bit
even
iris
laughed
at
this
naive
suggestion
it
was
delightful
to
think
that
their
arch
enemy
was
actually
helping
the
baronet
affairs
at
that
very
moment
and
would
continue
to
do
so
until
he
was
flung
aside
as
being
of
no
further
value
although
ventnor
himself
had
carefully
avoided
any
formal
commitment
the
cablegrams
awaiting
the
shipowner
at
singapore
showed
that
confidence
had
already
been
restored
by
the
uncontradicted
use
of
his
lordship
name
robert
at
last
obtained
a
hearing
you
two
are
quietly
assuming
the
attitude
of
the
financial
magnates
of
this
gathering
he
said
i
must
admit
that
you
have
managed
things
very
well
between
you
and
i
do
not
propose
for
one
moment
to
interfere
with
your
arrangements
nevertheless
iris
and
i
are
really
the
chief
moneyed
persons
present
you
spoke
of
financial
houses
in
england
and
on
the
continent
backing
up
your
loans
six
months
hence
sir
arthur
you
need
not
go
to
them
we
will
be
your
bankers
the
baronet
laughed
with
a
gaiety
that
revealed
whence
iris
got
some
part
at
least
of
her
bright
disposition
will
you
sell
your
island
robert
he
cried
i
am
afraid
that
not
even
iris
could
wheedle
any
one
into
buying
it
but
father
dear
interrupted
the
girl
earnestly
what
robert
says
is
true
we
have
a
gold
mine
there
it
is
worth
so
much
that
you
will
hardly
believe
it
until
then
can
no
longer
be
any
doubt
in
your
mind
i
suppose
that
is
why
robert
asked
me
not
to
mention
his
discovery
to
you
earlier
no
iris
that
was
not
the
reason
said
her
lover
and
the
older
men
felt
that
more
than
idle
fancy
inspired
the
astounding
intelligence
that
they
had
just
heard
your
love
was
more
to
me
than
all
the
gold
in
the
world
i
had
won
you
i
meant
to
keep
you
but
i
refused
to
buy
you
he
turned
to
her
father
his
emotion
mastered
him
and
he
spoke
as
one
who
could
no
longer
restrain
his
feelings
i
have
had
no
chance
to
thank
you
for
the
words
you
uttered
at
the
moment
we
quitted
the
ship
yet
i
will
treasure
them
while
life
lasts
you
gave
iris
to
me
when
i
was
poor
disgraced
an
outcast
from
my
family
and
my
profession
and
i
know
why
you
did
this
thing
it
was
because
you
valued
her
happiness
more
than
riches
or
reputation
i
am
sorry
now
i
did
not
explain
matters
earlier
it
would
have
saved
you
much
needless
suffering
but
the
sorrow
has
sped
like
an
evil
dream
and
you
will
perhaps
not
regret
it
for
your
action
today
binds
me
to
you
with
hoops
of
steel
and
you
too
uncle
you
traveled
thousands
of
miles
to
help
and
comfort
me
in
my
anguish
were
i
as
bad
as
i
was
painted
your
kind
old
heart
still
pitied
me
you
were
prepared
to
pluck
me
from
the
depths
of
despair
and
degradation
why
should
i
hate
lord
ventnor
what
man
could
have
served
me
as
he
did
he
has
given
me
iris
he
gained
for
me
at
her
father
hands
a
concession
such
as
mortal
has
seldom
wrested
from
fate
he
brought
my
uncle
to
my
side
in
the
hour
of
my
adversity
hate
him
i
would
have
his
statue
carved
in
marble
and
set
on
high
to
tell
all
who
passed
how
good
may
spring
out
of
evil
how
god
wisdom
can
manifest
itself
by
putting
even
the
creeping
and
crawling
things
of
the
earth
to
some
useful
purpose
dash
it
all
lad
vociferated
the
elder
anstruther
what
ails
thee
i
never
heard
you
talk
like
this
before
the
old
gentleman
amazement
was
so
comical
that
further
tension
was
out
of
the
question
robert
in
calmer
mood
informed
them
of
the
manner
in
which
he
hit
upon
the
mine
the
story
sounded
like
wildest
romance
this
finding
of
a
volcanic
dyke
guarded
by
the
bones
of
and
the
quarry
but
the
production
of
the
ore
samples
changed
wonder
into
certainty
next
day
a
government
metallurgist
estimated
the
value
of
the
contents
of
the
two
at
about
yet
the
specimens
brought
from
the
island
were
not
by
any
means
the
richest
available
and
now
there
is
not
much
more
to
tell
of
rainbow
island
and
its
castaways
on
the
day
that
captain
robert
anstruther
name
appeared
in
the
reinstating
him
to
his
rank
and
regiment
iris
and
he
were
married
in
the
english
church
at
hong
kong
for
it
was
his
wife
wish
that
the
place
which
witnessed
his
ignominy
should
also
witness
his
triumph
a
admiral
decided
that
the
urgent
requirements
of
the
british
navy
should
bring
to
the
island
before
the
date
fixed
for
the
ceremony
lieutenant
playdon
officiated
as
best
man
whilst
the
was
left
so
scandalously
for
many
hours
that
a
hostile
vessel
at
least
twice
her
size
might
have
ventured
to
attack
her
soon
afterwards
robert
resigned
his
commission
he
regretted
the
necessity
but
the
demands
of
his
new
sphere
in
life
rendered
this
step
imperative
mining
engineers
laborers
stores
portable
houses
engines
and
equipment
were
obtained
with
all
haste
and
the
whole
party
sailed
on
one
of
sir
arthur
deane
ships
to
convoy
a
small
steamer
specially
hired
to
attend
to
the
wants
of
the
miners
at
last
one
evening
early
in
july
the
two
vessels
anchored
outside
rock
and
mir
jan
could
be
seen
running
frantically
about
the
shore
for
no
valid
reason
save
that
he
could
not
stand
still
the
sahib
brought
him
good
news
the
governor
of
hong
kong
felt
that
any
reasonable
request
made
by
anstruther
should
be
granted
if
possible
he
had
written
such
a
strong
representation
of
the
mahommedan
case
to
the
government
of
india
that
there
was
little
doubt
the
returning
mail
would
convey
an
official
notification
that
mir
jan
formerly
in
the
kumaon
rissala
he
who
once
killed
a
man
had
been
granted
a
free
pardon
the
mining
experts
verified
robert
most
sanguine
views
after
a
very
brief
examination
of
the
deposit
hardly
any
preliminary
work
was
needed
in
hours
a
small
concentrating
plant
was
erected
and
a
ditch
made
to
drain
off
the
carbonic
anhydride
in
the
valley
after
dusk
a
party
of
coolies
cleared
the
quarry
of
its
former
occupants
towards
the
close
of
the
following
day
when
the
great
steamer
once
more
slowly
turned
her
head
to
the
iris
could
hear
the
steady
thud
of
an
engine
at
work
on
the
first
consignment
of
robert
had
been
busy
up
to
the
last
moment
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
in
a
short
space
of
time
the
vessel
carried
a
large
number
of
passengers
and
he
did
not
wish
to
detain
them
too
long
though
they
one
and
all
expressed
their
willingness
to
suit
his
convenience
in
this
respect
now
his
share
of
the
necessary
preparations
was
concluded
his
wife
sir
arthur
and
his
uncle
were
gathered
in
a
corner
of
the
promenade
deck
when
he
approached
and
told
them
that
his
last
instruction
ashore
was
for
a
light
to
be
fixed
on
summit
rock
as
soon
as
the
dynamo
was
in
working
order
when
we
all
come
back
in
the
cold
weather
he
explained
gleefully
we
will
not
imitate
the
by
running
on
to
the
reef
should
we
arrive
by
night
iris
answered
not
her
blue
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
cliffs
sweetheart
said
her
husband
why
are
you
so
silent
she
turned
to
him
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
illumined
her
face
with
its
golden
radiance
because
i
am
so
happy
she
said
oh
robert
dear
so
happy
and
thankful
postscript
the
latest
news
of
and
anstruther
is
contained
in
a
letter
written
by
an
elderly
maiden
lady
resident
in
the
north
riding
of
yorkshire
to
a
friend
in
london
it
is
dated
some
four
years
after
the
events
already
recorded
although
its
information
is
garbled
and
to
a
certain
extent
inaccurate
those
who
have
followed
the
adventures
of
the
young
couple
under
discussion
will
be
able
to
appreciate
its
opinions
at
their
true
value
when
the
writer
states
facts
of
course
her
veracity
is
unquestionable
but
occasionally
she
flounders
badly
when
she
depends
upon
her
own
judgment
here
is
the
letter
my
dear
helen
i
have
not
seen
or
heard
of
you
during
so
long
a
time
that
i
am
to
tell
you
all
that
is
happening
here
you
will
remember
that
some
people
named
anstruther
bought
the
fairlawn
estate
near
our
village
some
three
years
ago
they
are
as
you
know
rich
the
doctor
tells
me
that
when
they
are
not
squeezing
money
out
of
the
wretched
chinese
they
dig
it
in
out
of
some
magic
island
in
the
atlantic
or
the
pacific
i
really
forget
which
anyhow
they
could
afford
to
much
more
than
they
do
anstruther
is
very
nice
looking
and
could
be
a
leader
of
society
if
she
chose
but
she
to
care
for
no
one
but
her
husband
and
her
babies
she
has
a
boy
and
a
girl
very
charming
children
i
admit
and
you
seldom
see
her
without
them
they
have
a
french
apiece
and
a
most
person
a
mahommedan
native
i
believe
stalks
alongside
and
behaves
as
if
he
would
any
person
who
as
much
as
looked
at
them
such
a
procession
you
never
saw
anstruther
devotion
to
her
husband
is
absurd
he
is
a
tall
handsome
man
of
distinguished
appearance
but
on
the
few
occasions
i
have
spoken
to
him
he
impressed
me
as
somewhat
yet
to
see
the
way
in
which
his
wife
even
at
him
you
would
imagine
that
he
had
not
his
equal
in
the
world
i
believe
there
is
some
in
their
lives
colonel
anstruther
used
to
be
in
the
army
he
is
now
in
command
of
our
local
yeomanry
and
although
his
name
is
i
have
often
heard
anstruther
call
him
their
boy
too
is
christened
robert
anstruther
now
my
dear
helen
make
inquiries
about
them
in
town
circles
i
wish
you
to
find
out
who
is
this
person
a
most
vulgar
name
i
am
sure
you
will
unearth
something
curious
because
anstruther
was
a
miss
deane
daughter
of
the
baronet
and
anstruther
people
are
well
known
in
yorkshire
there
are
absolutely
no
jenkses
connected
with
them
on
either
side
i
think
i
can
help
you
by
another
as
a
very
incident
occurred
at
our
hunt
ball
last
week
the
anstruthers
i
must
tell
you
usually
go
away
for
the
winter
to
china
or
to
their
fabulous
island
this
year
they
remained
at
home
and
colonel
anstruther
became
as
he
is
certainly
a
most
liberal
man
so
far
as
and
are
concerned
well
dear
the
dodgsons
you
remember
the
leeds
clothier
people
having
to
enter
county
society
invited
the
earl
of
ventnor
down
for
the
ball
he
it
seems
knew
nothing
about
anstruther
being
and
of
course
anstruther
the
moment
lord
ventnor
heard
her
name
he
was
very
angry
he
said
he
did
not
care
to
meet
her
and
left
for
london
by
the
next
train
the
dodgsons
were
annoyed
with
him
and
dodgson
had
the
bad
taste
to
tell
mrs
anstruther
all
about
it
and
what
do
you
think
said
ventnor
need
not
have
been
so
frightened
my
husband
has
not
brought
his
with
him
i
was
not
there
but
young
barker
told
me
that
anstruther
looked
very
as
she
said
this
was
the
word
he
used
but
young
barker
is
a
and
thinks
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
yorkshire
her
dress
they
say
was
which
i
can
hardly
credit
as
she
usually
goes
about
in
the
clothes
by
the
way
i
forgot
to
mention
that
the
anstruthers
have
restored
our
parish
church
the
vicar
of
course
is
enraptured
with
them
i
dislike
people
who
are
so
free
with
their
money
and
yet
reserved
in
their
friendship
it
is
a
sure
sign
when
they
popularity
that
they
dread
something
leaking
out
about
the
write
soon
do
forget
and
ventnor
those
are
the
lines
of
yours
matilda
perhaps
i
am
misjudging
them
anstruther
has
just
sent
me
an
invitation
to
an
home
next
m
dear
me
this
letter
will
never
get
away
i
have
just
destroyed
another
envelope
to
tell
you
that
the
vicar
came
in
to
tea
from
what
he
told
me
about
lord
ventnor
i
imagine
that
anstruther
said
no
more
than
he
m
colonel
anstruther
agents
discovered
after
long
and
costly
inquiry
that
a
shields
man
named
james
spence
a
marine
engineer
having
worked
for
a
time
as
a
miner
in
california
shipped
as
third
engineer
on
a
vessel
bound
for
shanghai
there
be
quitted
her
he
passed
some
time
ashore
in
dissipation
took
another
job
on
a
chinese
river
steamer
and
was
last
heard
of
some
eighteen
months
before
the
was
wrecked
he
then
informed
a
chinese
keeper
that
he
was
going
to
make
his
fortune
by
accompanying
some
fishermen
and
he
bought
some
stores
and
tools
from
a
dealer
no
one
knew
when
or
where
he
went
but
from
that
date
all
trace
of
him
disappeared
the
only
persons
who
mourned
his
loss
were
his
mother
and
sister
the
last
letter
they
received
from
him
was
posted
in
shanghai
though
the
evidence
connecting
him
with
the
recluse
of
rainbow
island
was
slight
and
purely
circumstantial
colonel
anstruther
provided
for
the
future
of
his
relatives
in
a
manner
that
secured
their
lasting
gratitude
