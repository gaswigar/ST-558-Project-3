april
alexa
hampton
was
awakened
by
a
sensation
in
her
chest
the
alarm
was
set
to
go
off
for
another
eleven
minutes
but
she
knew
her
sleep
was
finished
not
again
she
rolled
over
and
slapped
the
blue
pillowcase
that
little
sound
from
her
heart
and
the
twinges
of
angina
that
catchall
for
heart
discomfort
was
happening
more
and
more
now
just
as
ekelman
had
warned
her
but
she
was
going
to
let
it
stop
her
from
living
her
life
to
the
fullest
as
long
as
she
could
and
right
now
that
meant
having
her
morning
run
she
curled
her
legs
around
onto
the
floor
reached
for
a
nitroglycerin
tab
and
slipped
it
under
her
tongue
known
as
a
vasodilator
the
nitro
lowered
the
workload
on
her
heart
by
expanding
her
veins
it
should
get
her
through
the
workout
that
was
when
she
felt
a
warm
presence
rub
against
her
leg
hi
baby
still
sucking
on
the
tab
she
reached
over
and
tousled
knickers
hair
then
pushed
it
back
from
her
dog
eyes
her
old
english
sheepdog
a
huge
hirsute
vehicle
turned
and
licked
her
hand
knickers
was
ready
to
hit
the
trail
she
been
dreaming
of
steve
when
the
chest
tightness
came
and
maybe
the
emotion
that
stirred
up
had
caused
the
angina
she
still
dreamed
of
him
often
and
it
was
always
someplace
where
they
had
been
together
and
loved
and
they
were
ever
on
the
brink
of
some
disaster
that
frequently
caused
her
heart
to
race
waking
her
this
time
it
was
the
vacation
they
took
six
years
ago
in
the
spring
they
were
sailing
off
norman
cay
in
the
bahamas
she
was
raising
the
jib
the
salt
spray
in
her
hair
but
then
she
looked
up
and
realized
they
were
about
to
ram
a
reef
she
felt
the
dreams
were
her
unconscious
telling
her
to
beware
her
current
precarious
condition
if
as
is
said
at
the
moment
of
your
passing
your
entire
life
flashes
before
your
eyes
then
the
dreams
were
like
that
only
in
slow
motion
it
was
as
though
she
were
being
prepared
for
something
the
dreams
were
a
premonition
she
had
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
ally
had
had
rheumatic
fever
when
she
was
five
which
went
undetected
long
enough
to
scar
a
valve
in
her
heart
the
formal
name
was
rheumatoid
aortic
stenosis
a
rare
almost
freakish
condition
that
had
shaped
her
entire
life
the
pediatrician
at
mount
sinai
had
told
her
parents
they
should
think
twice
about
allowing
her
to
engage
in
any
vigorous
activity
her
heart
function
could
be
deceptively
normal
during
childhood
but
when
she
got
older
well
why
stress
that
organ
now
and
hasten
the
inevitable
day
when
it
could
no
longer
keep
up
with
the
rest
of
her
body
she
had
refused
to
listen
she
played
volleyball
in
grade
school
basketball
in
high
school
and
she
became
a
disciplined
runner
when
she
went
to
columbia
to
study
architecture
she
wanted
to
prove
that
you
could
make
your
heart
stronger
if
you
believed
hard
enough
and
wanted
to
live
hard
enough
now
though
it
was
all
catching
up
she
had
a
complete
checkup
two
weeks
ago
thursday
including
a
stress
test
and
doppler
echocardiogram
and
ekelman
had
laid
out
the
situation
gazing
over
her
glasses
and
pulling
at
her
chin
the
normal
twinkle
in
her
eyes
was
entirely
absent
alexa
your
condition
has
begun
worsening
there
a
clear
aortic
murmur
now
when
your
pulse
goes
up
how
long
can
you
go
on
living
in
denial
you
really
ca
keep
on
stressing
your
heart
the
way
you
have
been
you
can
have
a
normal
life
but
it
got
to
be
push
your
luck
living
half
a
life
is
so
depressing
she
declared
not
entirely
sure
she
meant
it
it
almost
worse
than
none
at
all
ally
i
warning
you
if
you
start
having
chest
sensations
that
respond
to
nitro
call
me
immediately
i
mean
that
there
a
new
drug
ranolazine
that
temporarily
shifts
your
heart
over
to
using
glucose
as
a
fuel
instead
of
fatty
acids
and
provides
more
energy
for
a
given
amount
of
oxygen
it
will
make
the
pain
back
off
but
i
only
want
to
start
you
on
that
as
a
last
resort
that
the
final
stop
before
heart
surgery
and
a
prosthetic
aortic
valve
day
by
day
the
illusion
of
normality
was
getting
harder
and
harder
to
maintain
she
had
been
playing
second
violin
in
an
amateur
string
quartet
called
the
west
village
oldies
but
a
month
ago
she
had
to
drop
out
she
did
have
the
endurance
to
practice
enough
to
keep
up
with
the
others
blast
it
was
having
to
give
up
things
you
love
that
really
hurt
still
she
was
determined
to
keep
a
positive
attitude
there
was
your
heart
and
then
there
was
heart
you
had
to
understand
the
difference
she
lay
back
to
wait
for
the
alarm
and
try
to
compose
her
mind
this
sunday
morning
was
actually
the
one
day
of
the
year
she
most
dreaded
the
anniversary
it
had
been
back
when
steve
was
still
alive
they
were
living
in
the
chelsea
neighborhood
of
new
york
in
a
brownstone
town
house
they
were
renting
the
rent
was
high
but
they
were
doing
all
right
steve
was
a
political
consultant
who
had
helped
some
fledgling
candidates
overcome
the
odds
and
win
important
elections
in
between
campaigns
here
he
also
got
work
in
the
nominal
democracies
in
latin
america
she
was
a
partner
in
a
small
firm
of
architects
who
had
all
been
at
columbia
together
and
decided
to
team
up
after
graduation
and
start
a
business
there
were
four
of
them
she
was
the
only
woman
and
it
was
a
struggle
at
the
beginning
for
the
first
three
years
they
had
to
live
off
crumbs
tossed
their
way
by
the
big
boys
subcontracts
from
skidmore
and
other
giants
they
felt
like
they
were
a
version
of
manpower
doing
grunt
work
designing
the
interiors
of
shopping
malls
in
the
midwest
and
banks
in
saudi
arabia
while
their
prime
contractors
got
to
keep
all
the
sexy
jobs
that
called
for
creativity
like
a
office
tower
in
but
then
interesting
work
finally
started
to
trickle
in
including
a
plum
job
to
convert
a
massive
parking
garage
in
greenwich
village
into
a
luxury
condominium
through
a
wild
coincidence
or
luck
she
had
personally
designed
the
apartment
she
later
ended
up
buying
for
herself
just
when
everything
seemed
to
be
turning
around
and
going
her
way
an
event
happened
that
stopped
her
in
her
tracks
five
years
ago
on
this
very
day
april
her
mother
nina
phoned
her
at
in
the
morning
and
in
a
trembling
voice
that
still
haunted
announced
that
her
father
was
dead
arthur
wade
hampton
was
and
he
been
cleaning
his
browning
shotgun
for
an
hunting
trip
to
long
island
so
claimed
the
night
before
and
she
was
awakened
by
the
explosion
of
a
discharge
a
horrible
accident
in
the
kitchen
of
their
in
the
west
village
like
hemingway
thinking
back
they
both
realized
it
was
the
wrong
time
of
year
to
hunt
anything
but
they
both
also
knew
he
wanted
the
world
to
think
that
moreover
it
was
precisely
the
kind
of
vital
lie
need
to
get
through
the
pointed
questions
and
skeptical
looks
that
lay
ahead
it
was
a
knowledge
all
the
more
palpable
for
being
unspoken
there
no
time
like
those
first
moments
after
a
tragedy
to
create
a
special
reality
for
yourself
it
was
only
in
the
aftermath
that
she
managed
to
unravel
the
reason
he
owned
and
operated
an
firm
in
soho
called
citispace
and
he
had
mortgaged
it
to
the
hilt
he
was
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
that
was
why
ally
had
not
spoken
to
her
younger
brother
grant
in
the
last
years
she
felt
she
had
no
choice
but
to
try
to
salvage
what
was
left
of
the
business
and
her
father
reputation
she
left
the
architectural
firm
and
took
over
citispace
it
turned
out
she
was
easily
as
good
an
interior
designer
as
she
had
been
an
architect
and
before
long
she
had
a
backlog
of
work
and
was
adding
staff
she
restructured
and
eventually
paid
off
the
firm
debt
it
was
now
on
a
sound
financial
footing
these
days
citispace
specialized
in
architectural
rehabs
in
the
greenwich
village
area
with
as
many
soho
and
tribeca
lofts
as
came
her
way
the
work
was
mostly
residential
but
lately
some
lucrative
commercial
office
jobs
were
beginning
to
walk
through
the
door
anything
dependent
on
luxury
real
estate
can
be
vulnerable
in
dicey
times
but
she
been
able
to
give
everybody
a
holiday
bonus
for
the
past
couple
of
years
she
even
given
herself
one
this
year
in
the
form
of
this
new
condo
apartment
which
she
loved
another
major
reason
she
taken
over
citispace
was
to
try
to
provide
her
mother
some
peace
and
dignity
in
her
twilight
years
but
then
irony
of
ironies
nina
who
was
a
very
lively
was
diagnosed
eighteen
months
ago
with
alzheimer
now
her
consciousness
was
rapidly
slipping
away
all
the
things
that
had
happened
over
the
last
few
years
had
called
for
a
special
kind
of
heart
she
had
known
steve
jensen
a
freelance
political
consultant
for
eight
years
and
they
lived
together
for
three
of
those
before
they
got
married
he
was
warm
and
tender
and
sexy
and
she
envisioned
them
in
rocking
chairs
forty
years
down
the
road
they
been
married
for
only
six
months
when
he
got
a
job
to
help
reelect
the
president
of
belize
at
first
he
was
reluctant
concerned
about
human
rights
issues
but
then
he
decided
the
other
candidate
the
alternative
was
even
worse
so
he
went
how
many
things
can
be
destined
to
go
wrong
in
your
life
exactly
seven
months
after
her
dad
died
she
received
a
phone
call
from
the
american
embassy
in
belmopan
belize
steve
had
been
flying
with
the
presidential
candidate
over
a
stretch
of
southern
rain
forest
in
a
cessna
when
a
sudden
thunderstorm
came
out
of
the
caribbean
and
the
plane
lost
radio
contact
that
was
the
last
etc
she
rushed
there
but
after
two
weeks
the
rescue
officially
became
a
recovery
mission
except
there
was
never
any
recovery
after
two
months
she
flew
back
alone
the
loneliest
plane
ride
of
her
life
she
still
had
his
clothes
in
her
closet
as
though
to
keep
hope
alive
when
you
love
someone
so
much
you
think
you
could
never
live
without
them
and
then
one
day
you
forced
to
it
resets
your
thinking
her
dad
death
and
then
steve
she
wanted
to
love
life
but
life
sometimes
felt
like
it
was
asking
more
than
she
should
have
to
give
she
currently
had
no
one
special
to
spend
her
weekends
with
but
she
had
given
up
nor
was
she
pushing
it
all
things
in
time
except
time
could
be
running
out
brrrring
went
the
alarm
and
knickers
responded
with
a
lively
woof
she
was
anxious
to
get
going
come
on
baby
ally
said
time
for
a
treat
she
struggled
up
and
made
her
way
into
the
kitchen
and
got
down
a
box
of
small
rawhide
chews
it
would
give
knickers
something
to
occupy
her
mind
for
the
few
minutes
it
took
to
get
ready
since
she
lived
at
the
west
end
of
barrow
street
right
across
the
highway
from
the
new
hudson
river
park
esplanade
that
defined
that
mighty
river
new
york
bank
she
had
a
perfect
course
for
her
morning
runs
she
usually
liked
to
run
down
to
the
park
at
the
rejuvenated
battery
park
city
and
then
back
she
did
know
what
the
distance
was
exactly
maybe
of
a
mile
each
way
maybe
slightly
more
but
it
fit
her
endurance
nicely
the
weather
was
still
cool
enough
in
the
mornings
that
knickers
could
accompany
her
at
full
trot
in
the
heat
of
summer
however
they
both
had
to
cut
back
she
put
on
blue
sweats
got
her
walkman
prepped
with
a
beethoven
quintet
and
was
just
finishing
cinching
her
running
shoes
when
the
phone
jangled
april
grant
hampton
listened
to
the
ringing
and
felt
the
sweat
on
his
palms
for
a
normal
person
this
would
be
an
insane
time
to
call
but
knowing
his
nutbag
sister
she
was
probably
already
up
and
about
to
go
out
for
her
daily
run
and
this
on
a
sunday
morning
for
chrissake
when
rational
people
were
drinking
coffee
or
having
sex
or
doing
something
sensible
like
retrieving
the
times
from
the
hallway
and
reading
the
columns
in
the
business
section
he
had
left
tanya
his
runway
model
to
get
her
beauty
sleep
and
had
driven
downtown
at
this
unthinkable
hour
on
a
mission
he
was
chief
financial
officer
of
bartlett
medical
devices
which
was
in
imminent
danger
of
going
under
and
taking
him
with
it
come
on
ally
pick
up
the
frigging
phone
he
gazed
out
the
windshield
of
his
blue
porsche
now
parked
directly
across
the
street
from
alexa
lobby
and
tried
to
calm
his
pulse
he
had
entirely
worked
out
the
pitch
but
that
was
okay
because
he
wanted
to
sound
spontaneous
who
was
it
said
sincerity
if
you
can
just
fake
that
you
got
it
made
that
was
what
hello
thank
god
she
picked
up
hi
sis
remember
the
sound
of
my
voice
long
time
right
come
on
he
thought
give
me
an
opening
here
there
was
a
pause
that
grant
hampton
thought
lasted
an
eternity
you
picked
a
funny
time
to
call
is
that
all
she
has
to
say
four
and
a
half
frigging
years
she
shuts
me
out
of
her
life
blaming
me
and
then
well
ally
i
figured
there
got
ta
be
a
statute
of
limitations
on
being
accused
of
something
i
did
do
so
i
decided
to
take
a
flier
that
maybe
four
years
and
change
was
in
the
ballpark
grant
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
this
is
sunday
and
hey
this
is
the
hour
you
do
your
sunday
run
right
if
memory
serves
so
i
thought
i
might
drive
down
and
keep
you
company
he
did
want
to
let
her
know
that
he
was
already
there
that
would
seem
presumptuous
and
probably
tick
her
off
even
more
but
by
god
he
had
to
get
to
her
again
there
was
a
long
pause
like
she
was
trying
to
collect
and
marshal
her
anger
you
want
to
come
to
see
me
now
that
a
heck
of
a
look
there
something
really
important
i
need
to
talk
to
you
about
it
actually
a
big
favor
for
you
sis
you
surely
heard
of
winston
bartlett
i
also
heard
of
donald
trump
so
well
he
got
a
clinic
out
in
new
jersey
that
grant
i
know
you
a
big
shot
in
his
medical
conglomerate
or
whatever
it
is
but
i
not
interested
in
whatever
you
peddling
i
going
out
to
run
now
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
phone
clicking
off
without
so
much
as
a
jesus
he
thought
she
really
is
ticked
this
is
going
to
be
harder
than
i
thought
okay
here
goes
plan
b
he
started
the
porsche
and
slowly
backed
to
the
corner
of
washington
street
where
he
parked
again
and
then
hunkered
down
loving
the
smell
of
the
new
leather
seat
ally
was
going
to
come
charging
out
of
the
front
door
in
about
two
minutes
with
that
damned
sheepdog
that
steve
gave
her
assuming
it
was
still
around
grant
hampton
was
three
years
younger
than
alexa
and
he
lived
in
a
different
world
whereas
she
never
wanted
to
be
anything
but
an
architect
he
had
aimed
directly
for
nyu
school
of
business
after
that
he
had
gone
to
wall
street
and
gotten
a
broker
license
and
begun
an
extremely
lucrative
career
as
a
bond
trader
for
goldman
sachs
he
discovered
he
had
the
nerves
as
well
as
a
gift
for
handling
big
numbers
in
his
head
soon
he
had
a
duplex
on
the
floor
of
a
new
building
on
third
avenue
in
the
east
sixties
he
loved
the
money
and
the
pad
he
also
liked
how
easy
it
was
to
pick
up
models
at
downtown
clubs
if
you
had
your
own
a
porsche
and
were
six
feet
tall
with
a
designer
wardrobe
that
was
where
he
met
tanya
also
six
feet
tall
a
striking
natural
redhead
who
did
a
lot
of
runway
work
for
chloe
he
thought
he
was
making
a
lot
of
money
but
tanya
who
could
order
a
bottle
of
dom
perignon
to
have
something
to
pass
the
time
while
the
hors
were
being
whipped
up
at
nobu
taught
him
he
was
just
barely
getting
by
she
was
accustomed
to
screwing
men
who
had
some
depth
to
their
money
but
when
he
tried
a
financial
endeavor
on
the
side
it
turned
into
a
disaster
time
to
move
on
he
sent
around
his
resume
and
managed
to
get
an
interview
with
bmd
which
was
looking
for
someone
to
help
them
hedge
their
exposure
in
foreign
currencies
the
next
thing
he
knew
he
was
trading
bonds
for
winston
bartlett
personal
account
when
bartlett
cfo
died
of
a
heart
attack
at
age
while
undergoing
oral
sex
in
the
backseat
of
a
chauffeured
lincoln
town
car
grant
hampton
got
temporarily
drafted
to
take
over
his
responsibilities
that
was
two
years
ago
he
was
aggressive
enough
that
there
was
never
a
search
for
a
replacement
he
had
made
the
big
time
and
he
had
done
it
before
he
was
but
now
it
all
hung
in
the
balance
if
this
did
work
out
he
could
end
up
widows
out
of
dun
bradstreet
hawking
ipos
tanya
would
be
gone
in
a
heartbeat
work
with
me
for
chrissake
sunday
april
as
alexa
stepped
out
of
the
lobby
the
morning
was
glorious
and
clear
spring
had
arrived
in
a
burst
of
pear
and
cherry
blossoms
in
the
garden
of
luke
church
up
the
street
but
here
by
the
river
the
morning
air
was
still
brisk
enough
to
make
her
skin
tingle
the
sun
was
lightening
the
east
setting
a
golden
halo
above
the
skyscrapers
of
here
with
the
wind
tasting
lightly
of
salt
the
roadways
were
silent
and
it
was
a
magic
time
that
always
made
her
feel
the
world
was
young
and
perfect
and
she
was
capable
of
anything
this
was
her
private
thinking
time
even
dreaming
time
and
she
shared
it
only
with
knickers
who
was
trotting
along
beside
her
now
full
of
enthusiasm
ally
suspected
that
her
sheepdog
enjoyed
their
morning
runs
along
the
river
even
more
than
she
did
as
she
headed
south
toward
battery
park
city
she
pondered
the
weird
phone
call
she
just
gotten
from
grant
seth
hampton
that
was
his
full
name
she
called
him
grant
but
her
mother
nina
always
called
him
seth
unfortunately
by
whatever
name
grant
seth
hampton
an
unremitting
hustler
was
still
her
brother
she
wished
it
were
not
so
but
some
things
could
be
changed
in
truth
she
actually
thought
grant
had
exhibited
a
kind
of
sequential
personality
over
his
life
when
they
were
kids
he
seemed
rakish
but
also
decent
at
the
time
of
course
she
was
impulsive
and
rebellious
herself
admiring
of
his
spunk
now
she
viewed
that
as
his
early
personality
later
when
he
was
pushing
thirty
and
the
wall
street
pressure
and
the
coke
moved
in
he
evolved
into
personality
number
two
he
lost
touch
with
reality
and
in
the
process
he
also
lost
his
inner
moral
compass
his
character
bent
and
then
broke
under
the
stress
proving
she
now
supposed
that
he
was
actually
a
weak
reed
after
all
now
she
did
know
what
his
personality
was
grant
grant
she
often
lamented
how
did
everything
manage
to
turn
out
so
bad
with
you
he
been
a
bond
trader
for
goldman
and
at
family
gatherings
he
brag
about
making
three
hundred
thou
a
year
but
he
had
a
lifestyle
involving
downtown
models
he
was
constantly
trying
to
impress
with
jewelry
and
expensive
vacations
so
that
was
enough
he
decided
to
freelance
on
the
side
he
set
up
a
web
site
and
with
his
license
opened
a
retail
business
trading
naked
futures
contracts
on
treasuries
he
managed
to
get
some
naive
clients
and
for
a
while
made
a
profit
for
them
but
then
the
market
turned
against
him
or
maybe
he
lost
his
rabbit
foot
and
he
began
losing
a
lot
of
other
money
a
couple
of
his
clients
with
heavy
losses
felt
that
he
misrepresented
the
risk
and
they
were
getting
ready
to
sue
they
also
were
threatening
to
file
a
complaint
with
the
sec
there
was
a
real
possibility
he
could
be
barred
from
the
financial
industry
for
life
the
only
thing
that
would
put
the
matter
to
rest
was
if
he
made
good
some
of
their
losses
but
grant
who
lived
hand
to
mouth
no
matter
what
his
income
did
have
any
liquidity
a
reserve
that
for
guys
who
do
have
any
balls
she
pieced
this
story
together
after
the
fact
somehow
he
gotten
to
their
father
who
bailed
him
out
mainly
to
save
the
family
from
disgrace
in
doing
so
he
had
mortgaged
citispace
right
up
to
the
breaking
point
when
she
finally
unraveled
this
poignant
tale
she
realized
her
father
believed
he
was
going
to
have
to
declare
bankruptcy
and
close
the
firm
laying
everybody
off
and
leaving
nina
a
pauper
he
thought
the
only
way
to
save
the
family
from
ruin
was
to
collect
on
his
life
insurance
unfortunately
however
he
botched
the
plan
nobody
believed
his
death
was
accidental
and
suicide
voided
the
policy
grant
had
always
inhabited
another
planet
from
her
dad
but
surely
these
days
he
was
able
to
support
any
lifestyle
he
chose
for
the
last
two
years
he
been
some
kind
of
hotshot
financial
manager
for
the
stakes
conglomerate
owned
by
winston
bartlett
or
so
nina
said
he
should
be
making
big
bucks
had
he
managed
to
screw
that
up
somehow
anytime
he
came
crawling
back
to
the
family
for
anything
it
was
because
he
was
in
some
kind
of
trouble
she
had
seen
him
in
so
long
she
wondered
if
she
even
recognize
him
not
that
she
had
any
plans
to
see
him
but
what
could
grant
possibly
want
from
her
now
also
why
would
he
pick
this
morning
this
anniversary
morning
to
reappear
did
he
know
what
day
this
was
or
maybe
he
did
actually
care
he
been
living
on
the
east
side
that
fateful
morning
of
their
dad
is
death
in
a
doorman
he
surely
could
afford
and
she
taken
a
cab
there
to
tell
him
in
person
rather
than
do
it
over
the
phone
when
she
did
her
voice
breaking
she
could
see
his
eyes
already
filtering
out
any
part
of
it
that
touched
him
by
today
he
probably
purged
it
out
of
his
memory
entirely
she
had
reached
the
vast
lawn
that
had
been
built
on
the
landfill
behind
stuyvesant
high
the
hudson
river
on
one
side
and
the
huge
expanse
of
green
on
the
other
it
was
manicured
and
verdant
a
la
grande
jatte
expanse
of
grass
where
you
could
see
visions
of
wicker
picnic
baskets
and
bottles
of
beaujolais
the
space
was
deserted
now
and
smelled
of
new
grass
knickers
had
gotten
ten
paces
ahead
of
her
as
though
impatient
that
alexa
was
slowing
her
down
but
then
she
paused
in
midstride
to
sniff
at
a
bagel
somebody
had
tossed
come
on
honey
ally
caught
up
with
her
wheezing
time
to
backtrack
my
chest
is
getting
tight
again
goodies
at
home
knickers
glared
at
her
dolefully
for
a
moment
not
buying
the
argument
let
go
she
resumed
her
stride
back
north
knowing
well
hoping
knickers
would
follow
home
her
senses
must
have
been
slowing
down
too
because
she
honestly
hear
him
when
he
came
up
behind
her
three
minutes
later
april
did
think
i
could
keep
up
did
you
grant
hampton
quipped
from
ten
paces
back
guess
you
did
know
i
started
playing
handball
every
other
morning
half
an
hour
with
the
man
great
for
the
stamina
not
to
mention
nosing
the
boss
since
naturally
i
let
him
win
she
does
look
half
bad
he
thought
maybe
she
getting
out
ahead
of
that
heart
problem
maybe
she
actually
okay
and
i
screwed
fuck
but
why
is
she
still
so
fried
at
me
sure
i
had
a
little
trouble
but
everybody
has
ups
and
downs
nina
that
hardhearted
bitch
wants
to
blame
me
for
arthur
death
when
it
was
nobody
fault
but
his
own
that
the
old
fart
pulled
the
plug
hell
i
was
going
to
pay
back
the
money
he
just
did
believe
in
me
he
never
did
what
are
you
doing
here
grant
when
she
turned
to
look
back
at
him
she
realized
she
was
prepared
for
this
moment
at
all
but
here
he
was
complete
with
a
trendy
ck
running
outfit
she
only
seen
him
a
couple
of
times
after
the
funeral
and
he
looked
like
life
was
treating
him
well
the
perfect
tan
the
lush
sandy
hair
with
an
expensive
cut
that
covered
the
top
of
his
ears
like
a
precise
little
helmet
he
was
a
touch
over
six
feet
with
athletic
shoulders
a
trim
figure
and
a
graceful
fluidity
to
his
stride
no
wonder
he
scores
with
models
damn
how
could
such
a
creep
look
that
great
i
told
you
i
trying
to
do
you
a
favor
he
momentarily
pulled
ahead
as
though
to
head
her
off
then
looked
back
and
grinned
she
thought
she
detected
a
vaguely
demented
quality
in
his
gray
eyes
hey
i
turned
my
life
around
ally
lots
of
good
karma
i
cfo
for
bmd
and
lets
me
handle
a
lot
of
his
personal
investing
too
she
put
on
a
burst
of
energy
trying
unsuccessfully
to
get
out
ahead
of
him
even
though
she
rehearsed
this
inevitable
moment
over
and
over
in
her
mind
she
had
realized
that
seeing
him
again
would
be
this
upsetting
why
was
he
here
but
now
that
he
was
maybe
she
ought
to
momentarily
let
go
of
the
anger
long
enough
to
find
out
what
he
wanted
fortunately
they
were
almost
back
to
barrow
street
so
this
was
going
to
be
quick
no
way
was
she
going
to
ask
him
up
look
grant
declared
over
his
shoulder
i
think
it
high
time
to
admit
i
been
a
shit
to
you
and
to
a
lot
of
people
now
he
slowed
enough
that
she
pulled
alongside
for
a
long
time
there
back
when
i
worked
for
goldman
i
was
an
immature
asshole
but
at
least
i
mature
enough
now
to
admit
it
i
think
the
window
for
owning
up
is
past
she
did
need
his
belated
mea
culpa
nothing
was
going
to
bring
their
father
back
and
having
a
scene
on
this
anniversary
day
would
only
demean
his
memory
sometimes
it
better
just
to
let
things
rest
no
that
wrong
ally
and
i
want
to
try
and
start
making
amends
for
all
the
money
dad
helped
me
out
with
i
want
to
do
a
kindness
for
you
to
repay
you
and
mom
as
best
i
can
now
he
was
jogging
along
beside
her
as
smooth
as
a
stroll
barely
breathing
it
was
adding
to
her
humiliation
grant
it
a
little
fucking
late
for
that
dad
gone
money
not
going
to
bring
him
back
and
i
okay
mom
okay
at
least
for
money
well
she
thought
that
true
for
now
but
who
knows
what
lies
ahead
so
what
a
couple
of
million
or
so
between
siblings
anyway
right
it
the
price
of
finding
out
who
everybody
is
just
now
she
told
herself
the
biggest
kindness
he
could
do
would
be
to
disappear
forever
she
thought
she
was
over
the
bulk
of
the
pain
and
the
feelings
of
humiliation
but
seeing
him
again
hearing
his
voice
and
looking
at
his
eyes
was
bringing
all
of
it
back
she
realized
she
was
never
going
to
be
over
it
ally
go
ahead
and
say
whatever
you
need
to
look
i
ca
really
do
anything
about
the
money
at
least
not
right
this
minute
though
got
a
big
ship
on
the
horizon
assuming
a
deal
i
working
on
comes
through
but
right
now
i
about
to
try
to
do
you
a
favor
i
think
i
can
muddle
through
without
any
of
your
grant
and
i
really
do
appreciate
your
showing
up
out
of
the
blue
like
this
bullying
your
way
back
into
my
life
she
glanced
over
and
saw
his
gray
eyes
were
hangdog
it
was
the
soulful
look
he
used
to
melt
her
resolve
but
not
this
time
she
was
yelling
at
herself
inside
not
to
give
an
inch
if
she
let
him
anywhere
close
to
her
life
again
she
was
sure
she
only
regret
it
well
like
it
or
not
i
am
here
at
the
moment
he
said
once
more
jogging
a
pace
ahead
then
twisting
his
head
back
they
were
at
the
crossing
and
he
could
see
her
building
from
where
they
were
he
had
to
get
a
hook
into
her
before
she
disappeared
into
that
damned
lobby
time
for
the
bait
by
the
way
ally
how
your
ticker
doing
these
days
you
still
have
to
watch
out
for
that
heart
thing

busy
morning
i
going
up
to
see
mom

a
damn

paused

wonderful
i
give
you
one
phone

tonight
at
home
she
had
knickers
leash
on
a
short
hold
and
was
waiting
for
the
light
to
change
but
i
got
to
go
now
shit
he
thought
the
hook
did
catch
ca
be
on
the
phone
telling
you
i
needed
to
see
you
why
the
hell
do
you
think
i
took
the
trouble
to
catch
you
before
your
day
got
started
you
know
i
hate
getting
up
this
early
he
stepped
onto
the
curb
and
stopped
ally
please
listen
this
is
something
i
can
do
for
you
i
wo
insult
you
by
saying
it
for
old
times
sake
but
in
a
way
it
is
i
got
you
a
shot
at
a
big
job
bartlett
wants
to
redo
the
ground
floor
of
his
place
on
gramercy
park
i
told
him
about
citispace
and
he
sounded
interested
and
said
he
like
for
you
to
come
by
and
meet
him
and
help
him
kick
around
some
ideas
she
looked
at
him
not
believing
a
word
you
hacked
into
my
life
at
seven
sunday
morning
for
that
you
had
to
see
me
give
me
a
break
what
do
you
really
want
and
this
better
be
good
okay
he
thought
cut
to
the
chase
you
correct
it
about
your
heart
what
about
it
make
it
real
he
told
himself
this
could
be
your
only
shot
all
right
here
the
unvarnished
deal
what
i
really
did
for
you
about
five
years
ago
bartlett
bankrolled
a
firm
called
the
gerex
corporation
it
was
the
brainchild
of
a
dutch
doctor
whose
research
project
had
just
been
sawed
off
at
the
knees
by
stanford
university
then
bartlett
moved
the
entire
operation
to
a
clinic
at
the
bmd
campus
out
in
new
jersey
called
the
dorian
institute
it
all
very
but
i
can
tell
you
gerex
has
a
new
procedure
in
clinical
trials
that
can
literally
work
miracles
the
head
researcher
this
dutch
doctor
has
pioneered
a
new
treatment
using
a
stem
cell
procedure
to
trick
an
organ
into
regenerating
itself
even
a
heart
it
like
you
grow
your
own
transplant
now
she
was
finally
listening
i
was
talking
to
the
dutch
guy
late
last
week
he
went
on
picking
up
a
faint
positive
vibe
and
hoping
desperately
he
could
build
on
it
and
he
said
he
looking
for
someone
in
their
thirties
with
a
heart
thing
i
think
it
like
what
you
have
to
be
part
of
this
big
clinical
trial
they
wrapping
up
but
they
have
to
do
it
immediately
so
they
can
put
the
data
in
their
final
report
to
the
national
institutes
of
health
and
you
thought
about
me
that
very
touching
grant
your
idea
of
doing
me
a
favor
is
to
let
some
dutch
quack
experiment
on
me
hey
do
be
so
fast
to
turn
up
your
nose
at
this
shit
he
thought
how
am
i
going
to
make
any
headway
his
procedure
operates
at
the
cell
level
the
way
they
say
it
works
is
he
takes
cells
from
your
bone
marrow
or
blood
or
whatever
and
makes
them
with
this
special
enzyme
and
then
injects
them
into
organ
tissue
it
causes
that
organ
to
start
regenerating
itself
that
sounds
completely
like
science
fiction
besides
i
not
well
he
doing
it
trust
me
but
there
only
a
couple
of
weeks
left
in
the
clinical
trials
so
everything
on
a
fast
track
now
if
you
the
least
bit
interested
you
got
to
call
him
tomorrow
if
you
do
i
sure
he
find
somebody
else
by
the
middle
of
the
week
he
reached
down
and
tried
to
give
knickers
a
pat
but
she
drew
away
good
for
her
ally
thought
then
he
looked
up
and
his
voice
grew
animated
ally
the
dutch
doctor
his
name
is
van
de
vliet
by
the
way
is
the
smartest
man
i
ever
met
i
say
he
a
good
bet
for
the
nobel
prize
in
medicine
this
time
next
year
i
put
my
last
dime
on
it
what
he
doing
is
so
incredible
i
should
even
be
talking
about
it
at
least
not
till
the
clinical
trials
are
finished
but
i
wanted
to
do
you
this
favor
she
thought
what
it
amounted
to
was
he
was
coming
to
her
with
another
one
of
his
hustles
probably
they
needed
somebody
to
round
out
their
clinical
trials
and
she
was
conveniently
handy
you
know
grant
maybe
i
just
pass
i
already
have
a
cardiologist
she
found
herself
wondering
what
ekelman
would
say
to
this
radical
new
treatment
all
right
ally
do
you
want
to
make
me
beg
i
need
you
to
do
this
when
i
described
you
to
van
de
vliet
i
could
tell
he
was
very
excited
this
could
change
everything
for
you
he
paused
perhaps
becoming
aware
of
the
pleading
tone
in
his
voice
for
chrissake
give
me
a
break
is
there
someplace
we
can
have
coffee
not
asking
to
come
upstairs
or
anything
i
just
want
to
see
if
we
can
be
on
speaking
terms
long
enough
to
help
each
other
out
in
a
way
she
was
relieved
though
she
was
secretly
hurt
all
over
again
too
he
was
crawling
back
to
her
to
beg
forgiveness
for
destroying
lives
no
he
was
back
and
groveling
because
he
thought
she
could
help
him
butter
up
his
boss
how
could
she
not
feel
used
god
that
was
so
like
him
at
that
moment
she
knew
there
was
never
any
chance
he
change
come
on
he
said
again
a
lousy
cup
of
coffee
there
that
little
french
bistro
on
hudson
street
he
tried
a
grin
hey
i
even
buy
for
a
moment
she
thought
she
felt
her
resolve
slipping
it
funny
but
after
you
break
up
a
family
no
matter
how
dysfunctional
you
start
repressing
the
bad
memories
but
then
something
comes
along
to
remind
you
all
over
again
grant
are
you
hearing
yourself
she
stared
at
him
you
sound
like
you
selling
snake
oil
why
was
i
afraid
you
back
off
you
really
doing
it
because
pissed
okay
you
got
a
right
but
i
brought
you
something
i
think
you
ought
to
at
least
look
at
he
was
unzipping
his
fanny
pack
and
taking
out
a
gerex
corporation
envelope
folded
in
half
christ
he
thought
miserably
why
is
she
doing
this
to
me
i
got
to
keep
the
door
open
read
this
and
then
give
me
a
call
tonight
like
you
promised
tell
you
more
about
him
she
hesitated
before
taking
it
it
was
thick
with
papers
and
she
was
planning
to
spend
the
day
visiting
nina
i
think
i
heard
enough
already
just
look
at
his
cv
van
de
vliet
he
done
a
lot
of
things
you
got
to
take
him
seriously
he
urged
it
into
her
hand
look
at
it
and
call
me
please
she
took
it
and
then
she
reached
down
and
patted
knickers
come
on
baby
let
go
up
he
watched
her
disappear
into
the
lobby
and
start
shooting
the
breeze
with
the
doorman
some
jerk
with
a
ponytail
who
just
come
on
duty
damn
maybe
the
best
thing
would
be
just
to
chloroform
her
and
let
her
wake
up
in
the
lab
needs
her
chapter
april
okay
you
better
take
it
from
here
winston
bartlett
declared
to
kenji
noda
over
the
roar
of
the
engine
he
had
lifted
his
feet
off
the
pedals
and
was
unbuckling
the
cockpit
seat
belt
he
liked
having
a
turn
piloting
his
mcdonnell
douglas
helicopter
on
the
commutes
between
his
corporate
headquarters
in
lower
manhattan
and
his
medical
research
park
in
northern
new
jersey
but
prudence
dictated
a
more
experienced
hand
on
the
collective
during
descent
and
landing
for
that
he
had
noda
formerly
of
the
japanese
defense
forces
a
tall
wiry
man
of
few
words
noda
was
also
his
bodyguard
chauffeur
and
curator
of
his
collection
with
the
sharp
delicious
aroma
of
the
pine
forest
below
wafting
through
the
cabin
noda
quickly
put
aside
the
origami
he
been
folding
to
center
his
mind
and
slid
around
a
special
opening
in
the
bulkhead
he
strapped
himself
into
the
seat
then
took
the
radio
headphones
the
sky
was
the
purest
blue
with
not
another
craft
in
the
visual
perimeter
they
were
after
all
over
a
forest
as
bartlett
settled
himself
in
the
passenger
compartment
he
thought
about
where
matters
stood
there
was
the
very
real
prospect
he
had
rolled
the
dice
one
time
too
many
the
daily
blood
tests
at
his
clinic
in
new
jersey
were
showing
he
was
disturbingly
close
to
using
up
his
nine
lives
to
look
at
him
though
you
never
suspect
at
he
was
still
trim
and
athletic
confident
even
cocky
with
a
full
head
of
steel
dark
hair
and
probing
eyes
that
instantly
appraised
whatever
they
caught
in
their
gaze
he
played
handball
at
a
private
health
club
near
his
gramercy
park
mansion
for
an
hour
every
other
morning
and
he
routinely
defeated
men
half
his
age
including
grant
hampton
remaining
a
player
in
every
sense
of
the
term
was
the
main
reason
he
enjoyed
flying
his
chopper
even
though
his
license
had
been
lapsed
for
eight
years
it
was
the
perfect
embodiment
of
his
lust
for
life
as
he
never
failed
to
point
out
his
lifelong
business
success
was
bad
for
a
city
college
grad
with
a
bachelor
degree
in
oriental
art
history
he
had
gotten
this
far
because
he
wanted
success
enough
to
make
it
happen
he
started
out
in
new
york
real
estate
but
for
the
last
twenty
years
he
had
concentrated
on
buying
up
small
priced
manufacturers
with
valuable
patents
and
weak
bottom
lines
he
dismantled
some
of
the
companies
and
sold
off
the
pieces
always
for
more
than
he
paid
for
the
whole
others
he
restructured
with
new
management
and
when
a
profitable
turnaround
was
in
sight
he
took
them
public
or
sold
them
to
a
major
player
like
johnson
johnson
the
potential
winners
though
the
ones
with
promising
pipelines
of
medical
devices
or
drugs
whose
fda
approval
was
imminent
he
relocated
here
at
the
bmd
campus
in
northern
new
jersey
but
competition
was
fierce
and
the
bigger
players
like
merck
and
j
j
had
limitless
research
capital
they
could
write
off
dead
ends
a
lot
easier
thus
it
was
that
five
years
ago
when
his
pipeline
was
drying
up
winston
bartlett
took
the
biggest
gamble
of
his
life
he
acquired
a
new
called
the
gerex
corporation
whose
head
scientist
was
at
the
cutting
edge
of
stem
cell
research
karl
van
de
vliet
had
just
had
his
funding
terminated
and
his
laboratory
at
stanford
university
closed
after
a
political
flap
by
bartlett
had
moved
van
de
vliet
here
to
new
jersey
and
poured
millions
into
his
stem
cell
efforts
bleeding
bmd
working
capital
white
and
racking
up
million
in
debt
just
to
keep
the
rest
of
the
company
afloat
now
though
the
gamble
was
paying
off
this
month
gerex
was
winding
up
clinical
trials
for
the
national
institutes
of
health
these
trials
validated
a
revolutionary
procedure
that
changed
the
rules
of
everything
known
about
healing
the
human
body
already
his
cfo
grant
hampton
was
heading
a
negotiating
team
hammering
out
a
deal
with
the
british
biotech
conglomerate
cambridge
pharmaceuticals
to
sell
them
a
percent
stake
in
gerex
over
million
in
cash
and
stock
were
on
the
table
and
there
were
escalators
depending
on
the
results
of
the
trials
now
under
way
the
problem
was
cambridge
had
only
seen
the
financial
and
summaries
of
data
from
gerex
successful
clinical
trials
they
knew
nothing
about
the
fiasco
of
the
beta
procedure
karl
called
just
before
we
left
and
said
she
worse
this
morning
bartlett
remarked
to
noda
he
was
removing
his
aviator
shades
and
there
was
deep
frustration
in
his
eyes
god
i
feel
so
damned
responsible
she
was
having
the
beta
was
kristen
idea
noda
reminded
him
she
wanted
to
do
it
what
he
did
say
was
on
both
their
minds
what
about
bartlett
himself
after
kristen
starr
had
had
the
beta
and
it
had
seemed
successful
bartlett
decided
to
have
it
too
now
his
daily
blood
tests
here
at
the
institute
were
showing
that
the
telomerase
enzyme
was
starting
to
metastasize
and
replicate
in
his
bloodstream
just
as
it
had
in
hers
well
bartlett
went
on
karl
thinks
he
got
a
new
idea
that
might
save
us
hampton
is
supposed
to
be
on
the
case
this
very
morning
he
stared
out
the
chopper
window
down
at
the
rooftops
of
his
empire
at
the
north
end
of
the
industrial
park
was
the
main
laboratory
where
stents
and
titanium
joint
replacements
were
tested
on
animals
mostly
sterile
pigs
though
some
primate
testing
also
was
under
way
the
central
area
had
two
large
manufacturing
facilities
where
the
more
complex
devices
were
made
the
buildings
were
all
white
cinder
block
except
for
the
one
they
were
hovering
above
now
it
was
at
the
far
south
end
a
massive
mansion
nestled
among
ancient
pines
and
reached
by
a
long
cobblestone
driveway
though
it
was
actually
the
oldest
building
of
the
group
by
a
hundred
years
it
was
the
latest
acquisition
for
the
complex
it
fronted
a
beautiful
lake
and
had
been
a
summer
of
a
railroad
baron
around
it
was
turned
into
a
luxury
retirement
home
complete
with
nursing
services
its
ornate
appointments
reminded
patients
of
the
frick
gallery
if
one
could
imagine
those
marble
halls
teeming
with
wheelchairs
and
nurses
bartlett
had
bought
the
defunct
manufacturing
complex
next
to
it
eighteen
years
earlier
for
the
bmd
industrial
park
but
it
was
only
six
years
ago
that
the
owners
of
the
mansion
a
group
of
squabbling
heirs
finally
relented
and
agreed
to
part
with
the
property
it
was
now
a
flagship
holding
of
bmd
he
had
an
eye
for
design
and
he
had
loved
remodeling
the
old
mansion
and
making
it
into
a
modern
clinic
and
research
facility
he
had
renamed
it
the
dorian
institute
and
moved
in
karl
van
de
vliet
and
the
research
staff
of
the
gerex
corporation
he
also
had
put
a
landing
pad
on
the
expansive
roof
along
with
a
stair
leading
down
to
an
elevator
that
could
take
him
directly
to
the
laboratory
in
the
basement
kenji
noda
settled
the
mcdonnell
douglas
onto
the
pad
and
cut
the
engines
bartlett
never
let
himself
worry
about
the
noise
the
patients
in
the
clinical
trials
were
here
at
no
charge
so
they
really
complain
particularly
since
they
were
now
part
of
what
was
possibly
turning
out
to
be
the
greatest
advance
in
the
history
of
medicine
if
your
alzheimer
had
just
been
reversed
at
no
charge
you
were
going
to
complain
about
a
little
hubbub
on
the
roof
i
wait
here
noda
said
opening
the
side
door
his
bald
pate
reminiscent
of
an
samurai
glistened
in
the
early
spring
sun
bartlett
nodded
knowing
that
his
pilot
did
not
trust
physicians
and
hospitals
taking
care
of
your
body
was
your
responsibility
kenji
noda
frequently
declared
and
he
trained
his
own
daily
he
ate
no
meat
and
drank
gallons
of
green
tea
when
he
practiced
swordplay
he
had
the
reflexes
of
a
man
half
his
age
he
never
discussed
why
he
had
left
japan
but
bartlett
assumed
it
was
for
reasons
best
left
in
the
dark
bartlett
headed
down
the
metal
stairs
leading
to
the
service
elevator
this
daily
ordeal
of
flying
out
to
give
a
blood
sample
and
to
see
kristen
was
increasingly
unsettling
as
he
inserted
his
magnetic
card
into
the

he
felt
his
hand
shaking
slightly
so
close
to
the
eternal
dream
of
humankind
so
close
how
was
it
going
to
end
april
vee
i
feeling
so
much
better
i
ca
tell
you
emma
rosen
reached
out
and
caught
her
physician
by
the
collar
of
his
lab
coat
pulling
him
down
and
brazenly
bussing
his
cheek
she
been
longing
to
do
this
for
three
weeks
but
had
mustered
the
nerve
until
now
this
morning
i
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
third
floor
twice
up
and
back
without
any
chest
pain
oy
can
you
believe
it
a
miracle
karl
van
de
vliet
was
a
couple
of
inches
over
six
feet
with
a
trim
face
and
sandy
hair
that
some
older
patients
judged
too
long
for
a
physician
his
english
normally
was
perfect
though
sometimes
he
made
a
mistake
when
trying
to
sound
too
colloquial
but
everyone
young
and
old
adored
his
retiring
dutch
manner
and
those
deep
blue
eyes
that
carried
some
monumental
sadness
from
the
past
they
also
were
sure
he
would
soon
be
recognized
worldwide
as
the
miracle
worker
he
was
the
prospect
of
a
nobel
did
actually
seem
that
emma
please
i
begged
you
to
rest
he
sighed
and
checked
the
dancing
electronic
pens
of
her
ekg
they
were
in
the
basement
of
the
dorian
institute
upstairs
the
suites
nobody
called
them
rooms
were
intended
to
invoke
a
spa
more
than
a
clinic
so
most
of
the
diagnostic
equipment
was
kept
in
a
row
of
examining
rooms
down
near
the
subterranean
lab
for
another
week
at
least
why
wo
you
listen
you
been
a
very
naughty
girl
i
may
have
to
tell
your
daughter
he
glanced
at
the
woman
readout
one
last
time
made
a
quick
note
on
his
handheld
computer
and
then
laid
a
thin
hand
across
her
brow
for
a
fleeting
subjective
temperature
check
she
all
but
fully
recovered
he
told
himself
it
truly
astonishing
five
weeks
earlier
she
had
come
through
the
front
door
of
the
dorian
institute
in
a
wheelchair
pushed
by
her
youngest
a
bottle
blonde
named
shelly
he
took
one
look
and
scuttled
the
normal
security
precautions
the
frisk
for
cameras
and
recording
devices
emma
low
cardiac
output
had
deteriorated
to
the
point
that
her
left
leg
below
the
knee
was
swollen
to
almost
twice
its
normal
size
owing
to
renal
retention
of
fluid
and
she
was
so
short
of
breath
she
required
oxygen
he
wanted
to
complicate
the
clinical
trials
by
taking
on
another
patient
at
that
late
date
but
she
had
been
referred
by
a
physician
friend
in
the
city
begging
how
could
he
turn
her
away
he
had
removed
a
microscopic
amount
of
bone
marrow
from
her
right
ankle
extracted
the
stem
cells
applied
the
hormonal
signal
that
told
them
to
develop
into
heart
muscle
and
then
injected
a
thriving
cell
factory
into
her
heart
since
stem
cells
could
be
made
to
ignore
the
body
rules
to
stop
replicating
after
a
certain
number
they
were
able
to
reproduce
forever
constantly
renewing
themselves
the
only
other
cells
with
that
immortal
characteristic
were
cancer
cells
in
fact
it
was
as
though
he
had
given
emma
a
new
kind
of
cancer
one
that
produced
cells
as
healthy
as
those
in
a
newborn
today
she
probably
could
have
run
up
those
stairs
although
his
stem
cell
technology
was
going
to
create
a
new
era
in
regenerative
medicine
he
had
experienced
his
share
of
bumps
in
the
road
five
years
earlier
stanford
university
had
canceled
his
research
project
there
since
the
work
he
had
been
doing
involved
the
special
stem
cells
in
unused
embryos
the
university
claimed
there
had
been
death
threats
to
its
president
the
board
of
regents
had
finally
decided
with
a
sham
show
of
remorse
to
revoke
his
funding
they
called
him
in
one
sunny
afternoon
in
may
and
pulled
the
plug
he
thanked
them
and
tore
up
his
contract
by
that
time
he
had
already
demonstrated
that
using
the
right
chemical
signals
stem
cells
could
be
coaxed
into
becoming
almost
any
organ
inserted
into
the
heart
they
became
new
heart
muscle
replacing
scars
inserted
into
the
brain
they
became
neural
tissue
no
way
was
he
going
to
be
stopped
now
they
did
know
what
they
were
losing
what
he
needed
was
a
white
knight
he
did
some
poking
around
and
came
up
with
winston
bartlett
then
floated
feelers
to
bartlett
people
what
if
he
proposed
bartlett
acquired
the
gerex
corporation
for
bmd
and
made
it
a
business
no
more
public
funding
and
maddening
administrative
meddling
the
research
already
completed
was
so
close
to
a
payoff
after
years
and
years
of
grinding
lab
work
and
thousands
of
white
mice
that
the
deal
could
be
considered
an
investment
where
percent
of
the
seed
money
had
already
been
supplied
by
taxpayers
winston
bartlett
had
liked
the
sound
of
that
and
karl
van
de
vliet
had
his
white
knight
once
his
financing
was
secure
he
decided
to
begin
by
solving
the
problem
that
had
dogged
him
at
stanford
since
there
would
always
be
a
distracting
problem
hounding
any
researcher
in
the
united
states
who
made
use
of
aborted
embryos
even
if
it
was
to
save
lives
he
was
determined
to
find
a
less
controversial
way
to
trick
mother
nature
and
garner
pluripotent
stem
cells
the
name
given
those
that
could
give
rise
to
virtually
any
tissue
type
he
had
after
he
moved
his
research
team
into
the
dorian
institute
just
over
years
ago
he
had
perfected
a
way
to
use
a
human
protein
an
enzyme
called
telomerase
to
make
adult
stem
cells
do
most
of
the
miracles
once
only
thought
possible
with
embryonic
cells
the
clinical
trials
over
the
past
seven
months
had
proved
conclusively
that
the
technique
worked
adult
stem
cells
when
treated
with
the
telomerase
enzyme
to
arrest
the
process
of
cell
senescence
could
indeed
regenerate
everything
from
the
human
brain
to
the
human
heart
from
parkinson
to
acute
myocardial
infarction
days
from
now
when
the
clinical
trials
were
formally
scheduled
to
be
completed
karl
van
de
vliet
would
have
enough
data
for
the
national
institutes
of
health
to
confirm
one
of
the
most
important
breakthroughs
in
the
history
of
medicine
unfortunately
however
there
was
that
other
bit
of
data
that
he
would
not
be
sharing
with
the
nih
the
beta
thinking
about
that
his
heart
heavy
he
turned
back
to
the
situation
at
hand
emma
you
making
wonderful
progress
he
continued
on
with
the
banter
but
do
push
yourself
too
hard
just
yet
she
laughed
sending
lines
across
her
forehead
her
voice
was
deep
and
rich
sultry
in
its
own
way
when
you
get
as
old
as
i
am
honey
you
do
anything
you
can
get
away
with
what
am
i
saving
it
for
i
just
might
go
to
atlantic
city
next
week
and
pick
up
a
sailor
well
then
i
may
have
to
have
shelly
go
along
and
keep
an
eye
on
you
he
said
with
one
last
programmed
smile
then
he
checked
his
watch
bartlett
should
be
arriving
any
minute
now
time
to
get
emma
rosen
the
hell
out
of
here
and
back
upstairs
he
turned
and
signaled
for
ellen
the
head
nurse
to
start
removing
the
electrodes
that
had
been
stuck
on
emma
for
her
ekg
ellen
had
been
with
him
when
he
was
at
stanford
and
her
loyalty
was
unquestioned
she
had
made
sure
that
the
beta
disaster
with
kristen
had
become
the
gossip
of
the
institute
still
how
much
longer
could
it
be
kept
quiet
then
sandra
hanes
the
lively
woman
in
charge
of
the
second
floor
for
this
shift
walked
into
the
examination
room
she
knew
nothing
about
kristen
perfect
timing
he
said
then
he
drew
her
aside
keep
an
eye
on
emma
will
you
try
and
keep
her
in
her
room
and
quiet
as
much
as
you
can
the
last
blood
work
showed
her
count
over
twelve
it
could
mean
there
some
minimal
rejection
rearing
its
head
probably
nothing
to
worry
about
but
can
you
just
keep
her
away
from
the
stairs
for
godsake
i
do
want
her
tiring
herself
out
i
tie
her
to
the
bed
if
i
have
to
sandra
answered
the
clinical
trials
had
required
a
mountain
of
paperwork
and
her
face
was
strained
from
working
long
shifts
including
a
lot
of
weekends
like
this
one
but
he
suspected
she
actually
appreciated
the
overtime
she
was
five
divorced
and
putting
a
daughter
through
rutgers
she
also
was
a
nurse
like
all
the
others
at
the
institute
and
her
loyalty
could
be
more
secure
still
he
knew
that
she
and
all
the
other
staffers
were
bursting
to
tell
the
world
about
the
miracles
they
witnessed
that
was
why
bartlett
had
insisted
on
an
ironclad
nondisclosure
agreement
in
the
contract
of
every
employee
to
be
strictly
enforced
and
to
put
teeth
into
the
security
all
employees
were
for
documents
or
cameras
or
tapes
on
the
way
in
and
out
to
violate
it
would
be
to
open
yourself
to
a
altering
lawsuit
during
world
war
ii
the
claim
had
been
that
loose
lips
sink
ships
here
they
would
render
you
a
pauper
for
life
nobody
dared
even
whisper
about
the
spectacular
success
of
the
clinical
trials
as
the
examining
room
emptied
out
he
checked
his
watch
one
more
time
winston
bartlett
was
due
any
minute
now
and
he
had
nothing
but
bad
news
for
the
man
trying
to
control
his
distress
he
walked
to
the
end
of
the
hallway
and
prepared
to
enter
the
lab
whereas
the
ground
floor
and
the
two
above
were
for
reception
common
dining
and
individual
rooms
the
basement
contained
the
laboratory
his
private
office
the
examination
rooms
and
an
or
never
yet
used
thankfully
there
also
was
a
accessible
only
through
an
elevator
in
the
lab
or
an
alarmed
set
of
fire
stairs
it
was
an
area
and
it
was
where
kristen
the
beta
casualty
was
being
kept
he
zipped
a
magnetic
card
through
the
reader
on
the
door
and
entered
the
air
lock
the
lab
was
maintained
under
positive
pressure
to
keep
out
the
slightest
hint
of
any
kind
of
contaminant
it
was
as
sterile
as
a
silicon
chip
factory
the
room
was
dominated
by
a
string
of
black
slate
workbenches
then
rows
and
rows
of
metal
shelves
with
containing
vials
of
a
highly
volatile
solvent
cocktail
he
had
engineered
especially
for
this
project
along
with
a
computer
network
and
a
huge
autoclave
and
several
electron
microscopes
he
walked
in
and
greeted
his
research
team
he
managed
to
keep
the
core
group
that
had
been
closest
to
him
at
stanford
four
people
who
he
believed
were
among
the
finest
medical
minds
in
the
country
they
were
the
renowned
molecular
biologist
david
hopkins
the
strikingly
beautiful
and
widely
published
endocrinologist
debra
connolly
and
two
younger
staffers
a
couple
who
met
and
married
at
his
stanford
lab
ed
and
beth
sparks
both
done
their
postdoc
under
him
they
all
were
here
now
in
the
wilds
of
northern
new
jersey
because
they
knew
they
were
making
medical
history
david
was
waiting
his
long
shaggy
forelock
down
over
his
brow
as
always
but
his
eyes
told
it
all
karl
bartlett
blood
work
from
yesterday
just
got
faxed
up
from
the
lab
at
princeton
his
enzyme
level
has
increased
another
three
point
seven
percent
damn
it
was
happening
for
sure
did
you
run
the
computer
simulation
a
estimate
is
that
he
going
to
go
critical
sometime
between
seventeen
and
nineteen
days
the
syndrome
van
de
vliet
sighed
just
like
kristen
she
faked
us
out
there
were
no
side
effects
for
weeks
van
de
vliet
shook
his
head
sadly
as
he
set
his
handheld
palm
computer
onto
a
side
table
later
he
would
transfer
all
the
day
patient
data
into
the
laboratory
server
the
packard
they
all
affectionately
called
the
mothership
then
he
began
taking
off
his
white
coat
bartlett
looks
to
be
inevitable
now
david
exhaled
in
impotent
despair
the
frustration
and
the
tension
were
getting
to
everybody
they
all
knew
what
was
at
stake
it
in
two
and
a
half
weeks
give
or
take
what
had
supposedly
been
a
cosmetic
procedure
had
gone
horribly
awry
van
de
vliet
wondered
if
it
was
the
ultimate
vengeance
of
the
quest
for
something
you
should
have
his
ab
blood
type
is
so
rare
if
we
just
kept
a
sample
before
the
procedure
we
have
something
to
work
with
now
van
de
vliet
said
sadly
we
still
might
be
able
to
culture
some
antibodies
he
had
told
his
research
team
yet
about
the
other
possible
option
using
somebody
else
as
an
ab
incubator
his
idea
was
to
find
a
patient
with
a
blood
type
of
ab
positive
and
introduce
a
small
quantity
of
the
special
beta
telomerase
enzyme
into
them
the
theory
was
that
this
might
induce
their
body
to
produce
compatible
antibodies
which
could
then
be
extracted
and
cultured
in
the
laboratory
if
a
sufficient
quantity
could
be
produced
they
could
be
injected
into
bartlett
and
hopefully
arrest
the
pattern
of
entering
the
host
bloodstream
and
metastasizing
into
the
more
complex
form
that
brought
on
the
syndrome
and
if
it
did
work
then
there
might
even
be
some
way
to
adapt
the
procedure
to
kristen
karl
if
cambridge
pharmaceuticals
finds
out
about
the
beta
fiasco
how
it
going
to
affect
how
do
you
think
it
going
to
affect
the
sale
if
this
gets
out
there
be
no
sale
to
anybody
bartlett
will
be
ruined
and
gerex
along
with
him
that
everybody
here
in
case
you
counting
he
turned
and
exited
the
lab
pushing
pensively
through
the
air
lock
and
then
he
walked
slowly
toward
his
office
collecting
his
thoughts
he
was
just
passing
the
elevator
when
it
opened
april
winston
bartlett
looked
up
to
see
van
de
vliet
as
he
stepped
off
the
elevator
and
the
sight
heartened
him
as
always
the
dutchman
was
a
genius
if
anyone
could
solve
this
damned
mess
surely
he
was
the
one
first
thing
karl
how
is
she
now
i
think
you
better
go
down
and
see
for
yourself
van
de
vliet
said
slowly
as
i
told
you
on
the
phone
she
still
comes
and
goes
i
think
it
getting
worse
bartlett
felt
a
chill
run
through
him
he
had
once
cared
for
this
woman
as
much
as
he
was
capable
of
caring
for
anybody
and
what
had
happened
was
a
damned
shame
all
he
had
intended
was
to
give
her
something
special
something
no
man
had
ever
given
a
woman
before
will
she
know
who
i
am
she
still
did
yesterday
it
depends
van
de
vliet
replied
yesterday
afternoon
she
was
fully
lucid
but
then
earlier
this
morning
i
got
the
impression
she
thinks
she
in
a
different
place
and
time
if
i
had
to
guess
i
say
regressing
chronologically
i
suppose
that
logical
though
nothing
about
this
makes
any
sense
bartlett
was
following
him
back
through
the
air
lock
and
into
the
laboratory
the
area
below
was
reachable
only
by
a
special
elevator
at
the
rear
of
the
lab
all
these
people
bartlett
thought
were
now
scared
to
death
van
de
vliet
and
his
research
team
might
actually
be
criminally
liable
if
the
right
prosecutor
got
hold
of
the
case
at
the
very
least
they
be
facing
an
ethics
fiasco
but
i
the
one
who
about
to
be
destroyed
in
every
sense
it
had
all
started
when
karl
van
de
vliet
confided
in
him
that
there
was
an
adjunct
procedure
arising
out
of
stem
cell
research
that
might
might
offer
the
possibility
of
a
radical
new
cosmetic
breakthrough
just
a
possibility
he
called
it
the
beta
since
it
was
highly
experimental
he
also
was
sure
it
was
reproducible
but
he
had
inadvertently
discovered
it
while
testing
the
telomerase
enzyme
on
his
own
skin
over
a
decade
ago
at
the
time
he
was
experimenting
with
topical
treatments
for
pigment
abnormalities
but
the
particular
telomerase
enzyme
he
was
working
with
had
had
the
unexpected
effect
of
changing
the
texture
of
his
skin
softening
it
and
removing
wrinkles
a
change
that
subsequently
seemed
permanent
the
idea
had
lain
dormant
while
they
were
preparing
for
the
clinical
trials
but
then
bartlett
the
personality
kristen
starr
had
had
a
career
crisis
that
she
blamed
on
aging
and
he
came
up
with
the
idea
of
having
her
undergo
the
skin
procedure
in
a
mistake
with
unforeseen
ramifications
she
had
then
been
made
an
official
part
of
the
nih
clinical
trials
after
she
had
gone
for
over
a
month
without
any
side
effects
bartlett
had
elected
to
undergo
the
procedure
himself
then
it
began
in
kristen
what
david
had
solemnly
named
the
syndrome
van
de
vliet
had
immediately
and
illegally
terminated
her
from
the
clinical
trials
removing
her
from
the
nih
database
she
was
now
being
kept
on
the
floor
below
in
the
subbasement
area
as
they
stepped
onto
the
elevator
to
go
down
bartlett
found
himself
wondering
how
many
of
the
staff
here
were
aware
of
the
real
extent
of
the
crisis
van
de
vliet
had
said
that
only
three
of
the
nurses
knew
about
kristen
and
the
syndrome
fortunately
they
all
were
trustworthy
two
had
even
been
with
him
back
at
stanford
they
would
never
talk
but
what
about
the
rest
they
all
fawned
over
kristen
starstruck
by
her
celebrity
and
they
spill
the
beans
in
a
heartbeat
if
any
of
them
found
out
the
story
would
be
everywhere
from
variety
to
the
page
six
gossip
column
it
would
certainly
mean
the
financial
ruin
of
bartlett
medical
devices
if
gerex
went
under
everything
else
went
with
it
on
the
other
hand
he
thought
ruefully
what
does
it
matter
if
i
end
up
like
her
i
wo
even
know
it
happened
the
telomerase
enzyme
is
completely
out
of
control
in
her
now
van
de
vliet
continued
first
it
metastasized
through
her
skin
and
into
her
blood
then
it
began
directing
its
own
synthesis
i
tried
everything
i
know
to
arrest
it
but
nothing
has
worked
i
still
have
a
faint
hope
though
if
we
can
make
some
headway
on
your
own
situation
he
paused
and
his
voice
trailed
off
in
the
meantime
though
i
think
it
would
definitely
be
wise
to
move
her
to
another
location
there
are
too
many
people
here
the
risk
is
enormous
word
is
bound
to
get
out
sooner
or
later
you
must
have
someplace
of
course
bartlett
nodded
i
rather
have
her
in
the
city
and
closer
to
me
anyway
but
let
me
see
if
i
can
talk
to
her
first
i
need
to
try
to
make
her
understand
though
it
probably
too
late
for
that
he
told
himself
they
stepped
off
the
elevator
and
entered
a
area
a
long
hallway
illuminated
only
with
fluorescent
bulbs
using
a
magnetic
card
as
a
key
bartlett
opened
the
first
door
they
came
to
as
always
he
was
dismayed
by
the
sight
for
a
moment
he
just
stood
looking
at
the
woman
sitting
up
in
a
hospital
bed
mutely
watching
a
flickering
tv
screen
showing
the
cartoon
network
he
had
truly
cared
for
her
perhaps
even
loved
her
for
a
time
then
he
walked
over
kristy
honey
how
you
feeling
she
stared
at
him
blankly
kristen
had
been
a
vivacious
blonde
who
had
her
own
showbiz
gossip
show
on
the
e
channel
till
it
was
canceled
during
a
scheduling
six
months
earlier
she
had
a
nervous
breakdown
declaring
to
bartlett
that
her
show
had
been
canceled
because
she
looked
like
a
crone
he
told
her
it
was
true
but
if
she
was
so
distraught
about
her
appearance
then
maybe
there
was
something
he
could
do
for
her
van
de
vliet
had
once
mentioned
an
experimental
skin
procedure
bartlett
turned
back
to
van
de
vliet
feeling
the
horror
sinking
in
karl
goddamit
we
got
to
reverse
this
let
talk
outside
van
de
vliet
said
bartlett
kissed
kristen
forehead
in
preparation
for
leaving
her
lifeless
blue
eyes
flickered
something
he
thought
it
was
a
flash
of
some
old
anger
who
could
blame
her
he
told
himself
but
back
then
who
knew
he
wanted
to
give
her
a
gift
like
none
other
not
quite
the
fountain
of
youth
but
maybe
a
cosmetic
version
her
skin
would
begin
to
constantly
renew
itself
and
he
been
right
the
promise
of
having
her
skin
rejuvenated
was
just
what
she
needed
to
get
her
back
for
more
than
a
month
the
miracle
seemed
to
be
working
and
there
were
no
side
effects
her
skin
was
becoming
noticeably
softer
and
more
supple
she
was
elated
screw
nih
trials
and
the
fda
he
then
decided
it
was
working
for
kristen
by
god
he
would
try
it
himself
he
was
getting
any
younger
but
no
sooner
had
he
had
the
procedure
too
than
kristen
started
evidencing
side
effects
first
it
was
little
things
like
lapses
in
memory
next
as
it
got
progressively
worse
she
could
no
longer
remember
why
she
was
at
the
institute
then
she
could
recall
her
name
where
she
lived
and
now
could
it
be
that
god
ca
be
cheated
and
when
it
tried
god
brings
down
a
terrible
vengeance
when
they
were
outside
in
the
hallway
he
said
i
have
a
place
on
park
avenue
that
empty
at
the
moment
we
used
to
spend
weekends
there
and
i
can
arrange
for
a
nursing
staff
all
of
it
he
paused
has
anybody
called
here
about
her
lately
just
her
mother
katherine
who
getting
pretty
frantic
the
woman
is
unbalanced
certifiable
god
help
us
if
i
told
her
to
see
what
she
could
find
out
from
kristen
publicist
good
bartlett
had
told
kristen
midtown
publicity
agent
the
nosy
arlene
of
guys
and
dolls
that
kristen
had
gone
to
a
private
spa
in
new
mexico
to
rethink
her
career
and
did
want
to
be
disturbed
she
desired
complete
solitude
any
communication
with
her
would
have
to
be
handled
through
his
office
he
looked
at
van
de
vliet
karl
tell
me
how
bad
it
is
for
me
now
for
you
he
hesitated
this
was
the
question
he
been
dreading
the
telomerase
numbers
from
yesterday
blood
sample
are
not
encouraging
as
i
told
you
your
topical
enzyme
application
has
metastasized
into
your
bloodstream
and
started
to
replicate
just
like
it
did
in
kristen
we
seeing
a
process
known
as
these
special
cells
have
learned
to
mimic
any
cell
they
come
near
they
become
the
tissue
that
those
cells
comprise
and
begin
replacing
the
healthy
tissue
with
new
in
kristen
case
we
think
it
now
entered
her
brain
and
it
seems
to
be
supplanting
her
memory
tissue
with
blanks
the
same
side
effect
could
eventually
evolve
in
you
that
does
begin
to
describe
the
real
horror
bartlett
thought
too
impossible
to
imagine
the
only
thing
left
is
to
find
some
way
to
cause
your
body
to
reject
the
enzyme
van
de
vliet
said
i
optimistic
that
we
might
be
able
to
grow
some
telomerase
antibodies
in
another
patient
with
your
blood
type
then
culture
enough
of
them
to
stop
the
syndrome
in
its
tracks
it
worth
a
try
frankly
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
but
your
blood
type
is
ab
which
is
extremely
rare
also
the
problem
is
that
we
possibly
be
putting
that
other
person
at
severe
risk
too
let
go
back
up
to
the
lab
bartlett
said
that
idea
of
yours
hampton
thinks
he
got
somebody
a
woman
in
her
late
thirties
he
put
his
hand
on
van
de
vliet
shoulder
we
going
to
get
her
on
board
however
we
have
to
chapter
april
aimes
was
staring
at
the
on
the
screen
of
his
compaq
armada
and
feeling
an
intense
urge
to
put
his
fist
through
its
twisted
spiral
crystals
what
do
you
do
when
you
come
up
with
an
idea
that
could
possibly
save
thousands
of
lives
using
simple
technology
and
then
the
piece
gets
spiked
by
your
newspaper
owners
at
the
very
last
minute
because
it
exposes
some
important
new
york
hospitals
to
unpleasant
but
constructive
scrutiny
what
it
makes
you
want
to
do
is
tell
everybody
down
on
the
third
floor
to
stuff
it
and
walk
out
and
finish
your
book
undistracted
by
corporate
bs
or
unfortunately
by
a
paycheck
around
him
the
newsroom
of
the
new
york
sentinel
a
weekly
newspaper
positioned
editorially
somewhere
between
the
late
lamented
new
york
observer
and
the
village
voice
was
in
final
sunday
countdown
with
the
monday
edition
about
to
be
put
to
bed
the
technology
was
state
of
the
art
and
the
room
flickered
with
computer
screens
blue
pages
that
gave
the
tan
walls
an
eerie
cast
composition
everything
was
done
by
thinking
machines
and
the
reporters
thirteen
on
this
floor
were
mostly
in
their
late
twenties
and
early
thirties
and
universally
underpaid
the
early
morning
room
was
bustling
though
it
felt
to
stone
like
the
end
of
time
nobody
was
paying
any
attention
to
him
but
that
was
normal
everybody
was
doing
their
own
thing
besides
nobody
else
realized
he
just
had
a
major
piece
killed
at
the
last
minute
now
he
felt
as
though
he
were
frozen
in
place
in
this
room
in
this
job
in
this
life
the
book
he
had
almost
finished
was
going
to
change
a
lot
of
things
it
would
be
the
first
major
explication
of
stem
cell
technology
for
general
readers
stem
cells
were
going
to
revolutionize
everything
we
knew
about
medicine
and
the
research
was
going
further
than
anyone
could
have
dreamed
the
possibility
of
reversing
organ
degeneration
even
extending
life
was
hovering
right
out
there
just
at
fingertips
it
cried
out
for
a
major
book
he
had
read
everything
that
had
made
its
way
into
the
medical
journals
but
the
study
that
was
furthest
along
was
privately
funded
and
now
cloaked
in
secrecy
it
was
at
the
gerex
corporation
whose
head
researcher
was
a
dutch
genius
named
karl
van
de
vliet
the
company
had
been
bankrolled
by
the
medical
mogul
winston
bartlett
after
van
de
vliet
lost
his
funding
at
stanford
winston
bartlett
of
all
people
but
that
was
another
story
thirteen
months
earlier
the
gerex
corporation
had
trolled
for
volunteers
on
the
national
institutes
of
health
web
site
referring
to
a
pending
special
study
the
notice
suggested
the
study
might
be
using
stem
cell
technology
in
some
fashion
if
that
study
was
what
stone
aimes
thought
it
was
it
would
be
the
first
to
use
stem
cells
in
clinical
trials
nobody
else
was
even
close
karl
van
de
vliet
was
the
ball
game
unfortunately
however
his
study
was
being
held
in
an
atmosphere
of
secrecy
why
even
the
identities
of
the
participants
in
the
trials
were
like
a
state
secret
since
winston
bartlett
owned
gerex
it
surely
had
been
ordered
by
him
you
had
to
wonder
what
that
was
all
about
whatever
the
reason
stone
aimes
knew
that
in
order
to
finish
his
book
with
the
latest
information
he
had
to
get
to
van
de
vliet
but
bartlett
had
forbidden
any
interviews
and
gerex
clinic
called
the
dorian
institute
was
to
the
public
and
reportedly
guarded
with
serious
security
but
he
thought
perhaps
he
had
just
come
up
with
an
idea
of
how
to
get
around
that
he
stared
a
moment
longer
at
the
dim
reflection
coming
back
at
him
from
the
antiglare
screen
which
now
informed
him
that
his
cover
feature
had
been
chopped
truthfully
it
was
happening
more
and
more
this
was
the
third
time
in
eight
months
that
a
major
muckraking
piece
had
been
axed
also
as
he
stared
at
it
the
reflection
told
him
he
was
getting
any
younger
the
hairline
was
no
longer
where
it
had
been
in
his
college
photos
it
was
up
about
half
an
inch
and
the
blue
eyes
were
sadder
the
lines
under
them
deeper
still
the
tousled
brown
hair
was
thick
enough
the
brow
mostly
and
he
still
had
hope
he
was
exactly
young
anymore
but
neither
was
he
getting
on
the
willy
loman
years
remained
safely
at
bay
he
was
and
divorced
with
an
joyce
who
had
departed
to
be
a
garden
designer
in
northern
california
taking
with
her
their
daughter
amy
on
whom
he
doted
he
had
a
apartment
in
the
east
nineties
on
the
top
floor
of
a
fashionable
brownstone
he
was
socially
unattached
as
the
expression
goes
but
he
was
so
compulsive
about
finishing
the
book
that
he
spent
weekends
hunched
over
his
ibm
aptiva
nursing
a
of
brooklyn
lager
and
writing
deathless
prose
the
truth
was
he
was
lonely
but
he
did
allow
himself
to
think
about
it
he
always
vowed
he
amount
to
something
by
forty
and
now
it
was
as
much
for
amy
as
for
himself
she
lived
with
his
near
el
cerrito
california
and
she
meant
the
world
to
him
the
mortifying
part
was
he
was
a
week
behind
with
this
month
support
check
and
he
knew
joyce
needed
the
money
it
made
him
feel
like
a
callous
deadbeat
dad
when
the
real
culprit
was
an
unlucky
confluence
of
inescapable
bills
he
make
it
up
next
week
but
he
sworn
he
would
never
let
this
happen
that
was
why
he
had
a
larger
game
plan
get
out
of
this
frigging
day
job
and
finish
the
book
the
time
for
that
plan
to
kick
in
was
approaching
at
warp
speed
this
last
insult
was
surely
god
subtle
way
of
informing
him
that
his
future
was
in
the
freelance
world
every
day
out
there
would
be
a
gamble
but
he
could
write
anything
he
damn
well
pleased
there
was
a
parable
set
down
by
the
ancient
taoist
philosopher
lao
tzu
that
stone
aimes
reflected
on
more
and
more
these
days
it
was
the
story
of
two
oxen
one
was
a
ceremonial
sacrificial
ox
who
for
the
year
before
he
meets
the
axe
was
feted
with
garlands
of
lotus
flowers
and
plied
with
ox
goodies
the
other
was
a
wild
ox
who
had
to
scrounge
in
the
forest
for
every
scrap
but
the
story
went
on
the
day
the
ax
was
to
drop
what
would
that
ceremonial
ox
give
to
change
places
with
that
haggard
struggling
underfed
wild
ox
that
the
one
he
empathized
with
the
one
who
was
out
there
half
starved
but
free
the
sentinel
was
an
iron
rice
bowl
that
normally
never
let
anybody
go
except
for
grossest
incompetence
or
flagrant
alcoholism
on
the
other
hand
getting
ahead
was
all
about
office
politics
kissing
the
managing
editor
hindquarters
and
copying
him
on
every
memo
to
anybody
to
make
sure
nobody
else
took
credit
for
something
you
thought
of
on
the
plus
side
he
knew
he
was
a
hell
of
a
medical
journalist
there
was
such
a
gap
between
medical
research
and
what
most
people
knew
the
field
cried
out
for
a
stephen
hawking
of
health
a
medical
carl
sagan
the
way
he
saw
it
there
was
room
at
the
top
and
he
was
ready
for
a
major
career
breakthrough
he
had
done
premed
at
columbia
before
switching
to
journalism
and
these
days
he
read
the
journal
of
the
american
medical
association
from
cover
to
cover
every
issue
along
with
skimming
the
many
other
journals
now
on
the
web
the
piece
that
just
got
cut
was
intended
to
show
the
world
that
investigative
journalism
was
alive
and
well
and
trying
to
make
a
difference
he
documented
that
hospital
mistakes
were
actually
the
eighth
leading
cause
of
death
in
the
united
states
the
institute
of
medicine
estimated
that
medical
errors
caused
between
fifty
and
a
hundred
thousand
deaths
a
year
rivaling
the
number
from
auto
accidents
or
aids
he
gotten
enough
data
to
be
able
to
quantify
how
many
of
those
deaths
were
in
leading
new
york
hospitals
yet
there
was
no
federal
law
requiring
hospitals
to
report
mistakes
that
caused
serious
injury
or
death
to
patients
the
reason
seemed
to
be
that
the
medical
lobby
he
named
names
had
successfully
turned
back
all
attempts
by
congress
to
pass
such
a
law
even
though
it
was
a
formal
recommendation
by
the
institute
of
medicine
the
problem
was
once
you
admitted
you
screwed
up
you
could
get
sued
so
there
was
no
formal
accountability
but
and
here
was
the
constructive
part
if
patients
medical
records
were
put
on
the
web
everything
even
their
medications
it
could
make
a
big
dent
in
the
hospital
medication
that
alone
could
cut
accidental
hospital
deaths
in
half
he
pitched
jay
grimes
the
managing
editor
to
let
him
do
a
piece
for
the
sentinel
jay
had
agreed
and
even
promised
him
the
front
page
jay
liked
him
but
since
all
the
real
decisions
were
made
by
the
owners
known
as
the
family
there
was
much
jay
could
do
to
protect
his
people
stone
now
realized
that
more
than
ever
the
on
his
compaq
screen
was
from
jane
tully
who
handled
legal
affairs
for
the
paper
apparently
jay
did
have
the
balls
to
be
the
hatchet
man
so
he
given
the
job
to
jane
who
could
throw
in
a
little
legal
mumbo
jumbo
for
good
measure
and
she
had
even
had
the
courtesy
to
pick
up
the
phone
to
do
the
deed
instead
she
sent
a
frigging
see
attached
corporate
says
legal
implications
convey
unacceptable
risk
consider
an
piece
that
way
the
liability
will
be
all
yours
love
and
kisses
of
course
by
corporate
she
meant
the
family
or
more
likely
their
attorneys
down
on
nassau
street
it
was
really
too
bad
about
jane
she
was
a
and
had
her
own
legal
practice
with
a
large
law
firm
in
midtown
but
she
always
dropped
by
before
her
sunday
brunch
to
answer
any
legal
questions
that
might
be
pending
before
the
sentinel
was
put
to
bed
stone
knew
pretty
well
how
her
mind
worked
he
should
jane
tully
was
his
former
very
former
significant
other
they
d
lived
together
for
a
year
and
a
half
on
first
avenue
in
the
east
sixties
but
she
was
type
a
tailored
armani
suits
and
always
on
time
and
he
was
a
type
b
elbow
patches
and
pasta
the
denouement
had
been
seismic
and
full
of
acrimony
and
accusations
so
was
she
killing
this
major
piece
out
of
spite
he
wondered
just
to
prove
one
last
time
who
really
had
the
actually
it
would
have
been
nice
to
think
so
that
would
put
a
human
face
on
this
gutless
travesty
but
the
attached
memo
had
enough
legal
jargon
that
another
reason
was
immediately
suggesting
itself
the
owners
of
the
paper
the
family
the
twins
harry
and
bosco
and
their
mother
adeline
the
heirs
of
edward
jordan
actually
were
afraid
of
a
lawsuit
the
attachment
had
the
fingerprints
of
the
family
attorneys
all
over
it
jane
was
just
carrying
out
marching
orders
and
sure
enough
there
at
the
bottom
was
a
second
message
unsigned
and
not
part
of
the
original
memo
she
had
written
clearly
itmb
that
was
their
old
code
for
i
tried
my
best
well
jane
baby
who
the
hell
knows
maybe
you
did
damn
it
was
supposed
to
be
like
this
he
was
trying
to
be
a
carl
bernstein
for
chrissake
for
once
all
he
wanted
was
to
report
a
story
exactly
the
way
it
was
and
then
try
to
help
he
ultimately
wanted
to
fix
not
fault
he
hit
a
button
and
printed
out
a
copy
of
everything
then
minimized
the
screen
grabbed
his
jacket
and
walked
down
the
hall
was
this
the
moment
to
quit
it
was
except
he
could
afford
to
he
never
managed
to
put
enough
aside
to
take
off
a
year
and
live
on
air
and
write
and
still
get
that
check
out
to
joyce
and
amy
every
first
of
the
month
he
got
to
the
bank
of
elevators
and
pushed
the
button
for
the
third
floor
and
stepped
on
the
inspection
sticker
framed
just
above
the
controls
actually
told
the
whole
saga
of
why
his
cover
story
about
sloppy
procedures
in
new
york
and
national
hospitals
had
been
killed
the
building
was
owned
by
bartlett
enterprises
the
real
estate
holding
company
of
winston
bartlett
the
sentinel
held
a
very
favorable
lease
renewable
for
another
ten
years
at
only
a
percent
increase
when
it
rolled
over
in
seven
months
the
jordan
family
had
gotten
it
in
the
early
when
new
york
real
estate
was
still
in
the
toilet
from
the
stock
market
crash
of
and
for
once
winston
bartlett
really
screwed
up
now
it
was
about
a
fifth
of
the
going
price
per
square
foot
so
naturally
he
was
about
to
do
everything
he
could
to
break
the
lease
he
was
that
kind
of
guy
the
jordan
family
owners
of
the
sentinel
probably
figured
that
a
big
lawsuit
by
the
ama
or
somebody
would
overtax
their
legal
budget
and
give
bartlett
a
shot
at
their
soft
underbelly
thus
no
boats
were
to
be
rocked
the
elevator
chimed
and
he
stepped
off
on
three
this
floor
had
subdued
lighting
and
understated
birch
paneling
pale
white
in
the
reception
area
it
was
as
though
power
did
need
to
trumpet
itself
everybody
knew
who
had
it
he
waved
at
rhonda
the
receptionist
and
strode
past
she
glanced
up
then
said
does
she
know
you
coming
she
knew
full
well
he
was
headed
down
to
see
jane
unlike
most
organizations
which
take
sunday
off
this
was
always
a
big
day
for
the
sentinel
with
all
hands
on
deck
thought
i
give
her
a
little
surprise
no
kidding
she
was
reaching
for
the
phone
i
think
maybe
i
should
not
necessary
he
was
charging
down
the
hall
feeling
in
the
thick
beige
carpet
i
got
a
feeling
she
expecting
me
jane
door
was
open
and
she
was
on
the
phone
but
when
she
saw
him
she
said
something
abruptly
and
hung
up
he
strode
through
the
door
then
slammed
it
the
decor
was
bold
primary
colors
like
her
take
on
life
explicit
okay
he
demanded
what
the
hell
going
on
how
about
the
real
story
love
you
know
you
ca
hang
the
family
out
with
that
kind
of
liability
she
declared
then
got
up
and
came
around
her
desk
and
cracked
open
the
door
half
a
foot
and
you
the
one
person
here
i
ca
have
a
meeting
with
it
just
get
people
talking
again
good
let
the
world
hear
it
time
everybody
on
this
floor
learned
what
a
bunch
of
gutless
owners
we
have
he
watched
the
crisp
way
she
moved
inside
her
deep
blue
business
suit
complete
with
a
white
blouse
and
a
man
red
tie
seeing
her
here
hair
clipped
short
glasses
in
an
office
brimming
with
power
you
never
guess
she
liked
nothing
better
than
to
be
handcuffed
during
sex
stone
have
you
ever
considered
growing
up
she
settled
back
into
her
chair
the
desk
was
bare
except
for
her
notebook
computer
an
expensive
ibm
thinkpad
power
all
the
way
the
family
attorneys
are
just
trying
to
keep
us
from
getting
dragged
into
court
at
least
until
we
can
get
the
paper
lease
on
this
building
renewed
we
going
to
need
to
focus
on
that
negotiation
not
be
distracted
by
some
massive
libel
suit
brought
on
by
an
irresponsible
mudslinging
piece
you
practically
accused
the
ama
of
bribery
and
you
named
three
senators
one
from
new
jersey
for
chrissake
stone
there
might
be
a
time
for
that
but
this
is
not
it
this
was
exactly
the
reason
he
expected
what
it
really
meant
was
the
family
was
scared
stiff
of
winston
bartlett
they
figured
he
was
going
to
go
to
court
to
try
to
break
the
sentinel
lease
let
me
ask
you
a
question
whatever
happened
to
journalistic
ethics
around
here
remember
that
statement
of
purpose
they
have
everybody
sign
before
they
could
be
hired
the
news
without
regard
you
know
we
were
both
so
damned
proud
to
be
a
part
of
that
now
helping
them
kill
anything
that
the
slightest
bit
controversial
is
that
what
we
come
to
stone
what
the
new
york
sentinel
has
come
to
is
to
try
and
stay
out
of
legal
shit
till
their
lease
is
renewed
she
brushed
an
imaginary
lock
of
hair
from
her
face
a
residual
gesture
she
once
used
to
stall
for
time
when
she
actually
did
have
long
hair
just
let
it
go
you
to
get
the
signed
and
notarized
documentation
we
need
to
run
that
piece
assuming
we
even
could
would
cost
a
fortune
in
time
and
resources
well
he
told
himself
there
was
possibly
something
to
that
from
a
legal
standpoint
but
this
was
not
the
moment
to
let
sweet
reason
run
riot
okay
look
if
you
or
the
family
or
whoever
the
hell
believe
going
to
go
quietly
you
better
get
ready
for
some
revisionist
thinking
if
this
piece
gets
spiked
after
all
the
work
i
put
into
it
and
dammit
jane
you
know
i
can
document
everything
i
write
the
way
i
work
then
i
bloody
well
want
something
back
from
this
gutless
rag
actually
it
something
i
want
from
you
you
not
really
in
a
position
to
hey
do
try
to
ream
me
twice
in
the
same
morning
he
walked
around
her
desk
and
gazed
down
at
the
street
the
traffic
was
light
he
also
noticed
that
there
was
a
public
phone
on
the
corner
good
he
be
using
it
in
about
eight
minutes
then
he
took
a
moment
to
reflect
on
how
nice
it
was
to
actually
have
a
window
of
any
kind
you
know
the
saying
the
pen
is
mightier
than
the
sword
i
about
to
prove
that
once
and
for
all
but
there
something
i
need
i
need
a
half
hour
face
time
with
one
of
bartlett
employees
a
certain
karl
van
de
vliet
he
runs
a
company
that
bartlett
bought
out
called
the
gerex
corporation
strictly
for
they
got
some
important
clinical
trials
going
on
at
a
clinic
in
new
jersey
that
i
need
to
hear
about
she
looked
at
him
in
sincere
disbelief
stone
how
on
earth
am
i
supposed
to
you
talk
to
the
family
lawyers
they
got
ta
be
talking
to
bartlett
attorneys
by
now
make
it
happen
and
why
exactly
because
i
have
a
book
contract
jane
and
in
the
process
i
need
to
find
out
everything
there
is
to
know
about
winston
bartlett
biggest
undertaking
ever
he
has
bankrolled
something
that
could
change
the
face
of
medicine
you
doing
a
book
about
bartlett
her
astonishment
continued
growing
and
appeared
to
be
genuine
jesus
you
did
tell
hello
that
because
who
or
what
i
write
about
on
my
own
dime
is
nobody
effing
business
around
here
now
he
was
thinking
about
winston
bartlett
and
wondering
why
he
never
told
her
the
most
important
piece
of
information
in
his
life
it
was
how
he
was
connected
to
the
man
he
often
wondered
if
maybe
that
was
why
he
was
doing
this
book
on
stem
cells
knowing
that
half
of
it
would
end
up
being
about
bartlett
business
career
his
infinite
cruelty
was
the
book
actually
revenge
you
know
you
have
to
get
permission
to
reprint
anything
published
in
the
sentinel
the
paper
owns
the
rights
to
did
you
hear
me
he
smiled
it
a
book
my
book
there
no
editorial
overlap
who
the
publisher
they
exist
trust
me
his
small
publisher
was
exactly
random
house
but
they
were
letting
him
do
whatever
he
wanted
it
did
start
out
being
a
book
about
bartlett
per
se
he
went
on
but
now
he
becoming
a
central
figure
because
of
what
going
on
or
possibly
not
going
on
at
gerex
she
was
losing
her
famous
poise
what
what
are
you
writing
the
end
of
time
the
beginning
of
time
i
do
know
which
it
is
you
see
the
gerex
clinic
in
northern
new
jersey
has
clinical
trials
under
way
on
some
new
medical
procedure
involving
stem
cells
at
least
what
i
think
they
clamped
down
on
the
information
but
i
believe
van
de
vliet
who
the
head
researcher
there
is
perilously
close
to
one
of
the
most
important
breakthroughs
in
medical
history
i
just
need
to
get
all
this
confirmed
from
the
horse
mouth
is
that
what
you
want
to
interview
him
about
he
was
available
for
interviews
until
about
four
months
ago
i
actually
had
one
scheduled
but
it
abruptly
got
canceled
bang
suddenly
there
a
total
blackout
on
the
project
they
just
shut
down
their
press
office
completely
when
i
call
i
get
transferred
to
his
cfo
some
young
prick
who
likes
to
blow
me
off
for
starters
i
like
to
know
why
it
all
so
stone
private
medical
research
is
always
proprietary
for
god
sake
sooner
or
later
he
undoubtedly
hopes
to
patent
whatever
he
doing
a
privately
held
corporation
does
have
to
report
to
anybody
least
of
all
some
nosy
reporter
that
was
true
of
course
but
stone
aimes
knew
that
the
only
way
his
book
would
be
the
blockbuster
he
needed
to
get
free
of
the
sentinel
was
to
tell
the
real
story
of
what
gerex
was
in
the
process
of
achieving
and
to
be
first
doing
it
for
which
he
needed
access
make
it
happen
because
like
it
or
not
winston
bartlett
is
about
to
be
the
subject
of
a
major
volume
of
investigative
journalism
already
got
a
lot
of
what
i
need
that
was
precisely
the
case
but
there
was
no
need
to
overdo
brutal
honesty
the
only
question
is
does
he
want
it
to
be
authorized
or
unauthorized
it
his
choice
winston
bartlett
stone
knew
all
too
well
was
a
man
who
liked
nothing
better
than
to
see
his
name
in
the
papers
in
fact
he
used
the
free
publicity
he
always
managed
to
get
with
his
lifestyle
to
popularize
his
various
business
ventures
like
donald
trump
he
had
made
himself
a
brand
name
so
what
was
going
on
here
was
he
just
playing
his
cards
close
to
the
chest
waiting
to
make
a
dramatic
big
announcement
or
was
he
keeping
this
project
secret
because
he
was
worried
about
some
competing
laboratory
beating
him
to
a
patent
or
was
he
hiding
something
had
the
clinical
trials
out
in
new
jersey
gone
off
the
track
was
he
keeping
the
project
because
something
was
going
on
he
did
want
the
public
to
hear
about
had
stem
cell
technology
turned
out
to
be
an
empty
promise
or
had
there
been
some
horrible
side
effect
they
did
want
reported
so
could
you
just
raise
this
with
his
attorneys
because
if
he
lets
van
de
vliet
talk
with
me
directly
he
can
be
sure
i
get
the
story
right
we
can
do
this
the
easy
way
or
the
hard
way
it
up
to
him
stone
i
hope
you
have
an
alternative
career
track
in
the
advanced
stages
of
planning
because
the
minute
the
family
gets
wind
of
this
that
you
writing
some
about
bartlett
they
going
to
freak
even
if
you
doing
it
on
your
own
time
you
still
work
here
at
least
for
the
moment
your
name
is
associated
in
the
public
mind
with
the
sentinel
he
knew
that
which
was
why
this
was
going
to
be
all
or
nothing
just
do
me
this
one
favor
jane
it
the
last
thing
ever
ask
of
you
he
was
turning
to
walk
out
and
look
on
the
bright
side
when
the
family
finally
sacks
me
for
good
and
all
you
wo
have
to
write
me
any
more
nasty
memos
telling
me
to
be
a
good
boy
he
walked
to
the
elevator
and
took
it
down
the
next
thing
he
had
to
do
was
make
a
phone
call
and
this
was
one
that
required
a
pay
phone
he
thought
about
it
and
decided
one
possible
way
to
encourage
bartlett
to
open
up
was
to
try
to
bluff
him
to
make
the
man
think
he
knew
more
about
the
clinical
trials
than
he
actually
did
there
was
only
one
way
he
could
think
to
do
that
in
premed
days
stone
aimes
had
shared
a
dorm
room
at
columbia
with
dale
coverton
who
was
now
an
and
a
deputy
director
at
the
national
institutes
of
health
his
office
was
at
the
national
heart
lung
and
blood
institute
one
of
the
nice
things
about
having
friends
who
go
way
back
is
that
sometimes
over
all
those
years
something
happens
that
gives
one
or
the
other
a
few
chips
to
call
in
such
was
the
case
with
stone
aimes
and
dale
coverton
dale
oldest
daughter
samantha
a
track
star
and
math
whiz
had
at
age
thirteen
developed
a
rare
form
of
kidney
cancer
and
needed
a
transplant
she
was
given
six
months
tops
to
live
stone
aimes
had
done
a
profile
of
her
in
the
paper
he
worked
for
then
the
new
york
globe
and
he
found
a
transplant
donor
a
young
girl
on
long
island
with
terminal
leukemia
who
was
able
to
the
knowing
saved
another
person
life
the
two
had
met
and
cried
together
but
samantha
was
alive
today
because
of
stone
aimes
it
was
a
hell
of
a
chit
to
call
in
and
he
sworn
he
never
would
but
now
he
felt
he
had
no
choice
the
truth
was
dale
coverton
would
have
walked
through
fire
for
him
the
question
was
would
he
also
violate
nih
rules
stone
hoped
he
would
he
stopped
at
the
pay
phone
at
the
corner
of
park
and
eighteenth
street
an
area
where
nine
people
out
of
ten
were
wearing
at
least
one
item
of
clothing
that
was
black
it
also
seemed
that
six
out
of
ten
who
passed
were
talking
on
cell
phones
he
took
out
a
prepaid
phone
card
and
punched
in
the
access
number
and
then
the
area
code
for
bethesda
maryland
followed
by
dale
private
number
it
was
after
all
sunday
morning
hey
atlas
how
it
going
that
had
been
dale
nickname
ever
since
he
lifted
two
kegs
of
beer
okay
empty
over
his
head
one
balanced
on
each
hand
at
a
sigma
frat
blast
their
senior
year
it
now
seemed
like
an
eternity
for
dale
two
wives
ago
and
for
stone
one
wife
and
two
hey
truth
and
justice
over
and
out
it
was
their
purpose
old
code
phrase
for
i
aced
the
quiz
i
hit
with
the
girl
i
doing
great
my
man
i
need
some
truth
stone
said
justice
may
have
to
wait
a
big
delivery
truck
was
backing
up
against
the
sidewalk
its
gear
alarm
piercing
and
deafening
the
sun
was
playing
with
a
new
bank
of
clouds
in
the
south
that
thing
you
told
me
about
is
that
it
dale
voice
immediately
grew
subdued
he
was
a
balding
blond
guy
with
just
enough
hair
left
for
a
beyond
that
his
pale
gray
eyes
showed
a
special
kind
of
yearning
he
wanted
truth
and
justice
to
prevail
do
do
anything
that
wo
let
you
sleep
nights
but
this
situation
is
very
special
i
was
hoping
i
would
have
to
come
to
you
about
what
we
talked
about
last
month
but
i
running
out
of
time
and
ideas
he
paused
listening
to
the
sound
of
silence
i
suppose
it
too
much
to
ask
well
i
still
have
seen
any
data
or
preliminary
reports
the
nih
monitor
for
those
particular
clinical
trials
is
a
woman
called
cheryl
gates
and
she
not
returning
anybody
phone
calls
the
truth
is
she
does
have
to
but
another
possibility
is
she
does
actually
know
beans
and
she
too
embarrassed
to
admit
it
if
somebody
wants
to
keep
a
monitor
in
the
dark
for
strategic
commercial
reasons
it
easy
enough
to
do
well
how
about
the
other
thing
the
thing
we
talked
about
the
list
he
sighed
i
was
afraid
you
might
come
to
that
that
a
tough
one
truth
and
justice
hey
you
know
i
did
want
to
ask
but
i
running
out
of
cards
he
sighed
again
there
was
a
long
silence
and
then
you
know
asking
me
to
give
you
highly
restricted
access
codes
to
the
nih
web
site
we
should
even
be
talking
about
it
so
officially
the
answer
is
no
that
for
the
record
strictly
your
decision
but
he
had
his
fingers
crossed
even
as
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
asking
in
the
first
place
maybe
this
is
god
way
of
letting
me
even
up
things
a
bit
it
be
something
easy
or
it
does
really
count
does
it
i
could
end
up
knowing
more
about
these
trials
than
the
nih
does
stone
said
because
it
does
sound
like
you
guys
actually
know
much
at
all
let
me
think
about
it
and
send
you
an
tonight
whatever
comes
up
it
be
eggs
thanks
atlas
scrambled
eggs
was
a
reference
to
a
code
system
they
used
in
college
a
name
or
number
was
encoded
by
interlacing
it
with
their
old
phone
number
this
time
the
interlaced
number
would
be
an
access
code
for
proprietary
nih
data
i
do
not
think
i
long
for
the
world
here
at
the
sentinel
forming
a
mutual
hostility
society
i
sure
as
hell
hope
you
got
a
new
career
concept
ready
for
the
day
when
they
give
you
the
ax
dale
attempt
at
a
light
tone
did
not
quite
disguise
his
concern
funny
but
that
the
second
time
i
received
that
advice
in
the
last
half
hour
i
deem
that
unlucky
stone
sometimes
i
think
you
ought
to
try
not
living
your
life
so
close
to
the
damned
edge
maybe
you
ought
to
start
practicing
a
little
prudence
just
to
see
what
it
feels
like
i
that
wild
ox
we
used
to
talk
about
i
like
to
scrounge
but
i
also
like
to
look
around
for
the
biggest
story
i
can
find
trying
to
get
an
interview
with
a
guy
on
bartlett
staff
maybe
our
eggs
will
flush
him
out
just
take
care
of
yourself
and
keep
in
touch
you
too
and
they
both
hung
up
was
this
going
to
do
the
trick
he
wondered
as
it
happened
stone
aimes
already
knew
plenty
about
bartlett
business
affairs
he
had
been
a
lifelong
student
of
bartlett
the
man
and
as
part
of
his
research
into
the
gerex
corporation
he
had
pulled
together
an
profile
of
bartlett
situation
if
you
connected
the
dots
you
discovered
his
financial
picture
was
getting
dicey
bartlett
was
overextended
and
like
donald
trump
in
the
early
he
needed
to
roll
over
some
debt
and
restructure
it
but
his
traditional
lenders
were
backing
away
he
had
literally
bet
everything
on
van
de
vliet
if
his
research
panned
out
then
there
was
a
whole
new
day
for
bartlett
enterprises
that
had
to
be
what
he
was
counting
on
to
save
his
chestnuts
the
funny
thing
was
bartlett
did
really
like
to
spend
his
time
thinking
about
money
one
of
his
major
preoccupations
was
to
be
in
the
company
of
young
beautiful
women
usually
leggy
models
bartlett
also
had
an
estranged
wife
eileen
who
reportedly
occupied
the
top
two
floors
of
his
mansion
on
gramercy
park
rumor
had
it
she
was
a
paranoid
schizophrenic
who
refused
to
separate
or
give
him
a
divorce
she
had
been
photographed
for
at
least
a
decade
but
there
was
no
reason
to
think
she
was
still
alive
and
continuing
to
make
his
life
miserable
another
tantalizing
thing
to
know
about
winston
bartlett
was
that
he
had
bankrolled
a
zen
monastery
in
upstate
new
york
twenty
years
ago
and
went
there
regularly
to
meditate
and
recharge
he
had
once
claimed
in
a
forbes
interview
that
the
monastery
was
where
he
honed
his
nerves
of
steel
and
internalized
the
timing
of
a
master
swordsman
the
forbes
interview
was
also
where
he
claimed
he
had
quietly
amassed
the
largest
collection
of
important
japanese
samurai
swords
and
armor
outside
of
japan
for
the
past
five
years
he
had
been
lobbying
the
metropolitan
museum
of
art
to
agree
to
lend
its
dignity
to
an
adjunct
location
for
his
collection
and
to
name
it
after
him
the
bartlett
collection
winston
bartlett
lusted
for
the
prestige
that
an
association
with
the
met
would
bring
him
at
the
moment
some
of
his
better
pieces
were
housed
in
a
special
display
in
the
bartlett
building
in
tribeca
most
of
the
collection
however
was
in
storage
he
had
recently
bought
a
building
on
upper
park
avenue
and
some
people
thought
he
was
planning
to
turn
it
into
a
private
museum
well
stone
thought
if
the
stem
cell
project
works
out
he
could
soon
be
rich
enough
to
buy
the
metropolitan
he
walked
back
to
the
lobby
of
his
building
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
himself
in
the
plate
glass
yes
the
older
he
got
the
more
the
resemblance
settled
in
winston
bartlett
shit
thank
goodness
nobody
else
had
ever
noticed
it
chapter
april
when
ally
and
knickers
walked
into
her
lobby
alan
the
morning
doorman
was
there
just
arrived
tuning
his
blond
acoustic
guitar
watching
over
her
condominium
building
was
his
day
job
but
writing
a
musical
for
off
broadway
about
billy
the
kid
was
his
dream
he
was
a
tall
gaunt
guy
with
a
mane
of
red
hair
he
kept
tied
back
in
a
ponytail
while
he
was
in
uniform
and
on
duty
everybody
in
the
building
was
rooting
for
him
to
get
his
show
mounted
and
he
routinely
declared
that
he
and
his
partner
were
this
close
to
getting
backers
we
gon
na
have
the
next
rent
so
you
better
invest
now
was
how
he
put
it
alan
had
the
good
cheer
of
a
perpetual
optimist
and
he
needed
it
given
the
odds
he
was
up
against
knickers
immediately
ran
to
him
her
tail
wagging
hey
nicky
baby
you
look
beautiful
he
effused
then
he
struck
a
bold
e
minor
chord
on
his
guitar
like
a
flamenco
fanfare
and
reached
to
pat
her
come
here
sweetie
hi
alan
how
everything
seeing
him
always
bucked
ally
up
he
usually
came
on
duty
while
she
was
out
for
her
run
and
she
looked
forward
to
him
as
her
first
human
contact
of
the
day
he
was
younger
than
she
was
early
thirties
but
she
thought
him
attractive
in
an
east
village
sort
of
way
he
was
very
proud
of
the
new
yin
and
yang
tattoos
on
his
respective
biceps
she
admired
his
guts
and
his
willingness
to
stick
to
his
dream
no
matter
the
degradation
of
his
life
in
the
meantime
doing
great
hampton
things
are
moving
along
alan
i
told
you
a
million
times
to
call
me
ally
anything
else
made
her
feel
like
a
matron
hey
right
i
keep
forgetting
then
he
nodded
at
the
manila
envelope
grant
had
just
given
her
pick
that
up
on
your
run
i
was
ambushed
by
my
he
passed
it
along
what
that
mean
he
asked
with
a
funny
look
brothers
are
for
keeps
unfortunately
you
right
alan
the
whole
thing
was
long
ago
and
not
far
away
enough
she
was
urging
a
reluctant
knickers
on
through
the
inner
door
seeing
him
just
now
was
sort
of
like
an
aftershock
from
a
big
earthquake
in
another
life
sounds
like
you
need
a
hard
hat
he
said
and
turned
back
to
his
guitar
humming
and
dreaming
she
took
the
elevator
up
to
the
top
floor
and
let
herself
into
her
apartment
as
always
feeling
a
tinge
of
satisfaction
at
where
she
lived
home
sweet
home
her
apartment
was
in
an
idiosyncratic
building
whose
renovation
had
been
designed
by
her
old
architectural
firm
just
before
she
had
to
leave
and
take
over
citispace
it
was
their
first
big
job
in
the
city
she
was
the
one
who
had
designed
the
large
atrium
in
the
middle
and
the
open
glass
elevators
that
let
you
look
out
at
tall
trees
as
you
went
up
and
down
she
loved
the
building
but
at
the
time
she
could
have
begun
to
afford
an
apartment
there
later
when
she
could
none
was
available
then
she
heard
through
the
managing
agent
that
a
german
owner
after
completely
gutting
his
space
had
to
return
to
his
homeland
in
a
hurry
and
was
throwing
it
on
the
market
for
half
what
he
paid
she
built
a
bedroom
at
one
end
walling
off
an
area
with
glass
bricks
that
let
light
through
and
installed
a
country
kitchen
at
the
other
but
beyond
that
it
was
hardwood
floors
and
open
space
and
air
and
light
along
with
a
panoramic
view
of
the
hudson
river
out
the
north
window
and
a
central
skylight
that
kept
her
in
touch
with
the
sky
and
the
seasons
in
much
of
manhattan
it
was
possible
to
go
for
months
and
not
actually
walk
on
soil
you
could
completely
lose
the
sense
memory
of
the
feeling
of
earth
beneath
your
feet
she
did
want
to
lose
the
sky
too
since
she
could
afford
a
brownstone
with
a
rear
garden
the
next
best
thing
was
to
have
a
giant
skylight
what
she
really
dreamed
of
was
to
someday
have
a
vacation
home
on
the
caribbean
side
of
the
yucatan
where
she
could
wake
to
the
sounds
of
the
surf
and
play
bach
partitas
to
the
seabirds
in
the
coconut
palms
she
felt
there
was
something
spiritual
in
the
pure
sound
of
a
stringed
instrument
it
was
sweetness
and
joy
crystallized
it
went
with
the
sound
of
surf
they
belonged
together
she
had
actually
researched
and
designed
that
dream
house
already
the
place
itself
would
be
based
on
the
mayan
abodes
of
a
thousand
years
ago
on
stilts
with
a
bamboo
floor
and
a
roof
to
provide
natural
ventilation
and
since
this
was
all
a
dream
she
could
fantasize
that
steve
was
alive
and
was
there
too
maybe
this
was
her
version
of
the
muslim
paradise
a
land
of
milk
and
honey
and
infinite
beauty
and
pleasure
sometimes
late
at
night
when
the
world
was
too
much
with
her
she
would
put
on
headphones
and
a
bach
cd
and
imagine
she
was
on
that
beach
in
the
yucatan
gazing
up
at
the
glorious
stars
the
other
thing
she
wanted
to
do
someday
was
memorize
the
first
violin
score
of
all
the
beethoven
late
quartets
but
now
any
intensive
playing
which
was
more
tiring
than
it
looked
brought
on
chest
pains
after
a
few
minutes
shit
she
felt
like
she
was
slowly
being
robbed
of
everything
she
loved
she
decided
to
stop
with
the
negative
thoughts
and
get
ready
for
the
stressful
day
to
come
she
just
needed
a
few
quiet
moments
to
get
mentally
prepared
for
it
the
first
thing
she
did
was
give
knickers
an
early
morning
snack
then
a
fresh
bowl
of
water
and
a
large
rawhide
chew
to
occupy
her
energy
for
part
of
the
day
after
that
she
would
shower
and
change
for
the
trip
uptown
she
had
to
dress
for
the
rest
of
the
day
which
eventually
might
include
going
down
to
the
office
if
she
had
the
time
and
inclination
so
she
decided
to
just
throw
on
jeans
and
a
sweater
she
did
pay
any
attention
to
the
envelope
grant
had
given
her
she
just
tossed
it
onto
the
breakfast
counter
she
told
herself
there
was
time
to
look
at
it
now
but
she
also
realized
she
had
a
very
serious
psychological
resistance
to
opening
it
she
had
anticipated
that
just
seeing
him
once
more
would
make
her
this
tense
and
angry
his
proposition
was
surely
part
of
some
kind
of
scam
she
vowed
never
to
believe
him
again
it
was
going
to
take
a
lot
of
persuading
to
get
her
to
break
that
resolve
look
at
it
later
whenever
she
gave
knickers
a
pat
and
headed
out
the
door
in
times
gone
by
she
took
knickers
with
her
since
her
mother
loved
to
give
her
sinful
sugar
treats
and
fuss
over
her
but
these
days
condition
was
never
predictable
knickers
was
one
confusing
element
too
many
on
the
trip
uptown
she
always
stopped
at
zabar
for
some
smoked
fish
that
she
could
pass
off
as
kippers
and
some
buttery
scones
nina
was
born
in
a
little
place
called
in
southern
england
and
she
was
an
unreconstructed
brit
she
insisted
on
oatmeal
the
nutty
cooked
kind
for
breakfast
on
weekdays
and
kippers
and
dark
tea
on
weekends
now
when
ally
visited
she
never
knew
what
to
expect
some
sundays
nina
could
be
as
spunky
as
phyllis
diller
and
other
times
she
seemed
to
barely
recognize
her
though
she
sometimes
wondered
if
her
mom
just
acted
that
way
so
she
leave
sooner
and
let
her
get
back
to
her
soaps
she
claimed
to
be
watching
them
to
study
hispanic
culture
but
ally
suspected
the
real
reason
was
their
racy
clothes
and
plot
lines
and
today
on
the
anniversary
of
arthur
tragic
death
would
she
even
remember
him
alzheimer
could
proceed
at
a
frightening
pace
nina
had
been
a
notable
auntie
mame
kind
of
figure
around
greenwich
village
for
decades
she
smoked
woodbine
cigarettes
fiendishly
and
was
forever
giving
homeless
people
food
and
handouts
she
had
adopted
the
garden
at
luke
and
worked
there
weeding
and
pruning
and
planting
and
nurturing
from
late
spring
to
early
autumn
as
soon
as
afternoon
tea
was
completed
she
waited
an
only
moderately
decent
interval
before
her
first
scotch
and
soda
room
temperature
no
ice
one
should
have
a
little
something
should
one
arthur
joined
her
to
have
a
cocktail
after
work
once
in
a
while
but
mainly
he
successfully
kept
his
mouth
shut
about
her
smoking
and
drinking
everyone
knew
she
was
destined
to
live
to
a
hundred
cancer
was
surely
terrified
to
go
near
her
but
then
the
alzheimer
struck
one
of
nina
greatest
gifts
was
an
unerring
bs
detector
she
had
been
skeptical
about
grant
since
he
was
in
his
twenties
she
deemed
him
a
hollow
suit
full
of
vapid
ambition
she
also
believed
his
irresponsible
behavior
was
a
contributing
factor
to
arthur
death
though
she
did
not
have
the
same
ferocity
of
feeling
about
it
that
ally
did
she
had
had
him
pegged
as
a
for
so
long
that
she
already
had
zero
expectations
about
his
character
in
any
case
grant
contributed
nothing
to
the
care
of
nina
and
that
suited
ally
just
fine
as
part
of
the
financial
restructuring
she
sold
their
greenwich
village
condo
which
was
too
big
and
too
full
of
memories
for
nina
to
continue
living
there
she
then
found
her
a
apartment
in
a
wonderful
old
building
on
riverside
drive
and
when
nina
alzheimer
progressed
to
the
point
where
she
could
really
be
relied
upon
to
take
proper
care
of
herself
she
arranged
for
a
very
conscientious
and
sprightly
woman
from
the
dominican
republic
to
be
her
caregiver
maria
was
devoted
to
nina
and
ally
did
know
anyone
who
could
have
been
more
nurturing
she
had
been
there
for
nine
months
and
she
also
used
nina
space
to
periodically
for
her
daughter
natalie
who
had
a
darling
son
what
would
the
next
stage
be
ally
wondered
fearfully
and
would
her
mother
medical
insurance
pay
for
it
whatever
it
was
she
did
know
the
answer
and
she
was
terrified
aging
it
was
nature
process
to
make
way
for
the
new
but
why
did
the
last
act
have
to
be
so
cruel
seeing
her
mother
this
way
made
her
sometimes
think
that
perhaps
arthur
was
luckier
than
anyone
knew
managed
to
miss
out
on
having
to
watch
the
woman
he
loved
go
into
a
humiliating
decline
then
she
thought
about
her
own
mortality
the
heart
condition
that
refused
to
get
any
better
ekelman
had
never
been
more
serious
slow
down
take
it
easy
watch
out
for
warning
signs
she
said
everything
except
start
saving
up
for
a
transplant
or
maybe
she
was
just
postponing
that
announcement
as
long
as
possible
dammit
why
could
she
do
something
to
make
her
heart
stronger
that
was
the
most
frustrating
part
of
all
the
rest
of
her
body
could
still
have
run
a
mile
before
breakfast
she
could
traipse
all
over
lower
manhattan
saturdays
shopping
for
herbs
in
chinatown
and
shoes
in
soho
damn
why
would
her
heart
get
with
the
program
half
an
hour
later
a
big
zabar
bag
on
the
seat
beside
her
she
found
a
space
for
her
toyota
right
on
riverside
drive
just
across
from
the
park
she
took
a
final
look
at
the
sky
which
was
bright
and
blue
and
cheerful
and
then
bag
in
hand
she
headed
up
nina
building
was
a
dark
brick
prewar
and
had
no
doorman
though
the
super
apartment
was
right
off
the
lobby
allowing
him
to
receive
packages
and
generally
keep
an
eye
on
comings
and
goings
to
ally
the
bland
inevitably
tan
hallways
in
many
old
west
side
buildings
had
a
musty
quality
to
them
that
always
left
her
depressed
but
her
apartment
was
light
and
airy
after
ally
had
had
it
remodeled
and
redecorated
and
she
could
have
wanted
a
more
cheerful
home
the
wallpaper
was
a
light
floral
pattern
and
the
overstuffed
furniture
was
buried
in
enough
pillows
to
please
martha
stewart
and
in
the
living
room
there
was
the
piano
her
mother
once
played
now
covered
with
photos
from
happier
times
and
a
stereo
system
with
a
turntable
when
she
buzzed
maria
came
to
the
door
with
an
unusually
bright
smile
great
ally
could
always
tell
immediately
from
maria
face
whether
her
mom
was
having
a
good
day
or
bad
day
today
she
knew
immediately
was
going
to
be
good
miss
hampton
she
was
asking
about
you
wondering
when
you
get
here
maria
said
she
remembered
this
is
the
day
you
come
maria
was
half
a
head
shorter
than
ally
and
her
hair
was
dyed
a
defiant
black
she
had
an
olive
complexion
and
her
fine
features
made
her
a
handsome
woman
for
late
fifties
she
always
wore
bold
silver
jewelry
that
might
have
done
more
for
her
daughters
than
for
her
but
ally
liked
the
spunky
persona
that
went
along
with
too
many
accessories
she
still
had
a
trace
of
her
spanish
accent
even
after
all
the
years
in
new
york
on
days
when
her
mother
was
cognizant
maria
was
the
perfect
companion
for
her
ally
handed
over
the
zabar
bag
and
walked
in
hi
sweetie
nina
was
on
the
lounger
where
she
spent
most
of
her
waking
hours
yes
she
was
definitely
having
a
good
day
today
she
done
a
full
makeup
number
her
face
could
only
be
described
as
youthful
no
matter
that
she
was
past
she
had
elegant
cheekbones
and
a
mouth
that
was
still
sensuous
and
her
blue
eyes
remained
lustrous
though
nowadays
they
often
seemed
to
be
searching
for
something
or
someone
no
longer
there
she
had
a
colorist
come
in
every
three
weeks
to
keep
her
hair
the
same
brunette
it
had
always
been
and
that
had
a
way
of
making
ally
fantasize
she
had
aged
at
all
ally
also
felt
hoped
she
might
be
looking
at
a
spitting
image
of
herself
some
decades
hence
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
the
tv
was
on
sound
turned
low
and
her
mother
was
staring
at
the
multihued
screen
probably
the
tape
of
a
soap
somehow
missed
three
women
in
deeply
cut
blouses
were
arguing
all
appearing
either
angry
or
worried
or
both
in
times
past
nina
was
always
starting
some
new
project
claiming
that
was
how
she
kept
her
mind
alert
she
had
taught
herself
french
and
had
a
very
good
accent
particularly
for
a
brit
just
before
the
alzheimer
hit
she
decided
to
try
to
learn
spanish
as
something
to
divert
her
mind
and
keep
it
active
she
also
wanted
to
be
able
to
chat
with
the
increasingly
hispanic
workforce
in
restaurants
and
delis
now
though
ally
thought
her
mom
was
continuing
the
language
study
as
part
of
a
program
of
denial
nina
knew
her
mind
was
being
stripped
from
her
but
she
was
determined
to
try
to
wrestle
it
back
by
giving
herself
mental
challenges
the
struggle
was
hopeless
of
course
but
her
spirit
refused
to
admit
that
ally
bent
down
and
kissed
her
clear
white
forehead
hey
how
it
going
look
at
those
pathetic
creatures
she
declared
only
barely
acknowledging
ally
presence
if
boobs
were
brains
they
all
be
einstein
in
my
day
women
knew
how
to
make
themselves
attractive
simplicity
less
is
more
yep
ally
thought
this
is
going
to
be
a
good
day
she
obviously
spent
an
hour
on
makeup
for
all
her
complaining
she
probably
watches
maria
soaps
at
least
in
part
to
glean
cosmetic
tips
who
knew
maybe
she
was
learning
spanish
too
like
she
claimed
dear
god
let
her
do
it
maria
was
looking
into
the
zabar
bag
oh
she
going
to
love
this
could
you
come
in
the
kitchen
and
help
me
fix
a
tray
that
strange
ally
thought
maria
thinks
i
all
thumbs
around
food
preparation
and
she
never
wants
me
in
the
kitchen
the
apartment
was
old
enough
that
the
kitchen
was
a
separate
room
with
an
open
doorway
when
they
stepped
inside
maria
set
down
the
bag
and
turned
to
her
there
was
a
man
here
yesterday
i
never
saw
him
before
he
said
he
was
your
brother
is
that
true
ally
felt
a
chill
go
through
her
body
your
mother
seemed
to
know
him
maria
went
on
but
i
was
sure
whether
she
might
have
just
been
pretending
sometimes
you
never
know
what
she
gets
or
does
get
she
a
good
faker
what
what
did
he
want
well
the
first
thing
seemed
to
be
that
he
wanted
to
ask
your
mother
a
question
about
you
then
he
started
trying
to
talk
her
into
going
to
some
clinic
out
in
new
jersey
where
they
might
be
able
to
help
her
mind
shit
what
is
he
up
to
is
he
trying
to
get
to
me
through
nina
you
said
he
asked
mom
a
question
about
me
what
what
are
you
two
whispering
about
came
a
voice
from
the
doorway
all
kinds
of
secrets
ally
glanced
up
and
smiled
maria
was
just
telling
me
about
a
visitor
you
had
yesterday
mom
do
you
remember
if
anyone
came
to
see
you
pish
of
course
i
remember
seth
but
sometimes
i
think
i
just
as
soon
not
she
stared
at
ally
those
searching
blue
eyes
boring
in
do
you
ever
see
him
anymore
funny
you
should
ask
she
thought
then
she
wondered
why
not
tell
the
truth
she
could
think
of
any
reason
not
to
as
a
matter
of
fact
mom
grant
came
by
my
building
this
very
morning
i
had
seen
him
in
ages
he
called
and
said
he
wanted
to
meet
me
while
i
was
out
running
i
told
him
to
bug
off
but
he
came
anyway
he
wanted
me
to
let
just
say
he
still
wheeling
and
dealing
nina
looked
at
her
for
a
long
moment
he
showed
up
here
yesterday
morning
darling
out
of
the
blue
after
all
those
years
when
he
did
give
a
shit
excuse
my
francais
i
acted
like
i
did
quite
know
who
he
was
but
i
got
every
word
he
still
spending
his
salary
on
clothes
he
talked
a
lot
saying
he
knew
a
man
a
doctor
with
some
kind
of
experimental
treatment
who
could
turn
back
the
clock
on
my
or
at
least
stop
it
he
could
give
me
a
chance
to
take
my
mind
back
and
then
he
left
his
card
he
wanted
me
to
talk
to
you
about
it
and
then
call
him
back
grant
you
bastard
you
did
say
a
word
about
any
of
this
you
trying
to
do
no
need
for
rocket
science
he
was
using
nina
as
bait
this
was
his
way
to
make
sure
she
was
dragged
into
whatever
shenanigans
he
was
up
to
if
he
got
nina
out
to
that
place
in
new
jersey
whatever
it
was
it
would
be
like
he
had
a
hostage
she
was
so
angry
she
was
gasping
for
air
and
she
felt
that
damned
tightness
in
her
chest
coming
on
i
told
maria
to
throw
the
card
away
nina
went
on
but
then
i
got
to
wondering
what
if
it
true
you
do
really
think
of
course
not
nina
declared
but
ally
was
sure
how
much
she
meant
it
probably
he
just
needs
money
that
come
next
i
guess
hoping
i
give
him
a
payment
for
this
whatever
it
is
that
surely
what
going
on
trying
to
take
advantage
of
a
senile
old
woman
nina
did
appear
to
be
fooled
or
was
she
sometimes
she
did
her
thinking
out
loud
before
coming
to
a
conclusion
seth
may
be
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
with
me
ally
she
went
on
i
not
sure
i
want
any
of
his
miracle
cures
i
lived
my
life
tired
she
looked
away
when
you
young
you
never
think
about
what
it
like
to
be
old
but
then
when
you
do
get
old
you
somehow
imagine
being
young
again
having
to
do
it
all
over
her
voice
trailed
off
yes
ally
thought
you
had
plenty
of
pain
you
would
want
to
relive
nina
sat
back
down
on
her
flowered
chaise
and
closed
her
eyes
do
you
know
what
day
this
is
i
was
hoping
you
remember
she
reached
and
grasped
her
hand
been
five
years
today
exactly
i
still
have
nightmares
about
it
the
horror
nina
said
her
eyes
still
closed
but
he
did
it
for
me
you
know
he
thought
the
insurance
was
all
that
would
save
me
and
then
when
it
did
so
now
got
to
hang
on
with
all
we
got
for
him
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
directly
at
ally
one
day
soon
maybe
sooner
than
we
think
going
to
be
mad
as
a
hatter
time
ally
time
has
played
a
cruel
joke
god
the
prankster
is
keeping
me
in
physical
health
so
i
can
experience
every
step
of
my
own
degradation
then
she
glanced
back
at
the
spanish
soap
and
went
on
i
hope
you
know
how
to
enjoy
life
while
still
full
of
it
do
miss
a
minute
i
going
to
try
mom
ally
squeezed
her
hand
again
and
for
that
moment
sensed
nina
was
her
old
self
she
was
going
to
tell
her
about
ekelman
and
the
latest
heart
news
but
if
she
did
the
response
would
probably
still
be
the
same
live
life
for
all
it
worth
you
never
know
if
there
even
going
to
be
a
tomorrow
would
you
put
on
some
janacek
she
said
finally
aiming
the
remote
at
the
tv
and
clicking
it
off
one
of
the
string
quartets
i
had
my
fill
of
hispanic
tarts
i
learned
a
good
deal
of
spanish
from
them
but
sometimes
i
think
understanding
what
they
saying
just
makes
it
all
that
much
cheaper
that
was
when
ally
realized
with
a
burst
of
joy
that
nina
still
had
an
interior
life
that
she
was
carefully
hoarding
what
else
was
going
on
in
that
mind
the
sense
of
the
night
closing
in
do
not
go
gentle
please
stay
awhile
with
me
she
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
record
cabinet
her
mother
still
had
her
collection
of
old
today
they
were
called
vinyl
with
conductors
from
decades
ago
like
bruno
walter
and
arturo
toscanini
she
found
a
janacek
string
quartet
no
a
rare
mono
pressing
by
the
old
budapest
string
quartet
fifty
years
ago
and
put
it
on
the
turntable
still
loving
those
first
crackling
sounds
that
raise
your
anticipation
she
remembered
how
nina
would
put
on
a
record
in
the
evening
after
dinner
with
scotch
in
hand
and
make
the
family
sit
and
listen
she
suspected
that
had
a
lot
to
do
with
her
own
desire
to
play
the
violin
herself
someday
and
then
in
high
school
she
started
lessons
better
late
than
never
now
though
she
sensed
there
was
something
nina
wanted
to
tell
her
and
this
was
her
way
of
setting
the
stage
after
the
music
had
played
for
almost
three
minutes
nina
listening
with
eyes
closed
as
though
in
a
rapture
as
the
movement
clawed
its
way
toward
an
initial
theme
in
an
elusive
minor
mode
she
turned
and
looked
at
ally
he
did
tell
you
he
came
to
see
me
did
he
seth
i
guess
he
forgot
ally
said
it
was
a
lie
neither
of
them
believed
i
been
thinking
over
all
he
was
trying
to
say
i
did
get
everything
at
the
time
but
i
guess
my
feeble
mind
was
recording
it
now
it
all
coming
back
he
was
talking
about
arthur
and
his
suicide
ally
we
both
know
that
what
it
was
and
how
he
felt
responsible
and
how
he
was
finally
going
to
be
able
to
make
up
for
all
the
harm
done
to
me
and
to
you
but
he
was
worried
you
might
not
want
to
go
along
with
this
special
treatment
for
me
she
was
studying
ally
as
though
searching
for
an
answer
maria
had
discreetly
departed
for
the
kitchen
he
kept
talking
about
this
doctor
he
knew
at
this
clinic
he
swore
this
man
could
perform
a
miracle
for
me
he
said
i
should
do
it
whether
you
approved
or
not
ally
looked
at
her
wondering
what
to
say
this
was
getting
too
devious
for
words
then
nina
went
on
i
probably
not
remember
anything
about
this
by
tomorrow
but
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
when
you
get
as
mentally
addled
as
i
am
now
you
compensate
by
developing
your
other
senses
i
call
it
your
sixth
sense
and
ally
i
think
he
involved
in
something
that
evil
and
he
wants
to
draw
me
into
it
maybe
both
of
us
she
stopped
carefully
framing
her
words
i
sensed
a
kind
of
desperation
about
him
i
do
know
exactly
what
it
was
as
ally
listened
the
janacek
quartet
swelling
in
the
room
scratches
and
all
she
felt
more
and
more
like
an
utter
dunce
she
had
caught
any
of
this
in
grant
but
now
nina
was
right
about
that
sixth
sense
but
what
could
the
real
story
be
grant
was
more
a
simple
con
artist
than
some
embodiment
of
evil
think
the
music
man
in
designer
threads
not
darth
vader
evil
was
surely
too
strong
a
word
he
was
just
the
consummate
hustler
the
troubling
part
was
he
was
so
damned
good
at
it
mom
you
wonderful
today
why
do
we
all
three
go
somewhere
for
brunch
now
right
now
there
a
new
french
place
just
down
columbus
that
needs
checking
out
she
had
an
eerie
foreboding
it
might
be
their
last
chance
no
honey
you
brought
some
smoked
fish
did
you
that
all
i
want
nina
dismissed
the
idea
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
besides
no
one
in
this
town
knows
how
to
brew
a
proper
pot
of
tea
then
the
next
thing
ally
knew
she
was
back
to
musing
out
loud
about
grant
i
stop
wondering
he
said
this
doctor
he
knows
might
work
a
miracle
for
me
what
am
i
supposed
to
think
ally
was
trying
to
decide
whether
a
glimmer
of
hope
even
though
it
was
almost
certainly
false
might
be
a
healthy
tonic
for
nina
just
now
mom
grant
gave
me
some
materials
about
that
doctor
i
read
them
tonight
i
promise
she
was
listening
to
the
janacek
quartet
soar
and
it
was
bucking
her
up
let
me
see
what
i
can
find
out
he
wants
me
to
start
in
right
away
nina
pressed
i
think
he
said
there
are
some
studies
going
on
at
this
clinic
but
they
almost
over
it
free
now
and
unless
i
go
soon
i
ca
get
in
the
program
he
said
he
would
take
me
out
there
monday
morning
if
i
wanted
but
if
i
go
with
anybody
i
want
it
to
be
you
he
such
a
bastard
ally
thought
she
glanced
at
maria
who
been
watching
from
the
kitchen
door
and
listening
to
all
that
had
happened
she
was
looking
very
upset
and
she
motioned
ally
toward
the
doorway
with
her
eyes
let
me
get
a
glass
of
water
mom
she
headed
for
the
kitchen
did
you
hear
all
the
things
she
talking
about
she
asked
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
maria
nodded
a
lot
of
what
your
mother
said
is
true
it
was
very
strange
at
the
time
she
acted
like
she
did
understand
him
now
i
realize
she
did
or
maybe
it
all
just
came
back
to
her
what
do
you
think
is
really
going
on
ally
was
studying
her
hoping
to
get
at
the
truth
she
seems
a
lot
better
today
maria
paused
a
moment
miss
hampton
i
do
believe
your
mother
is
going
to
be
with
us
much
longer
i
saw
my
own
go
through
much
the
same
thing
there
always
a
glimmer
just
before
she
looked
down
and
stopped
you
said
grant
asked
her
something
about
me
what
i
do
think
she
remembers
he
was
asking
her
about
your
blood
type
it
seemed
a
very
strange
question
ally
could
think
of
any
reason
why
he
would
be
asking
that
maria
what
was
your
impression
of
him
overall
just
that
he
seemed
very
nervous
very
uneasy
she
hesitated
as
though
uncertain
how
to
continue
he
wanted
something
miss
hampton
that
much
i
sure
about
but
this
doctor
he
wants
to
take
her
to
it
sounded
to
me
like
he
does
things
that
are
against
the
laws
of
nature
grant
wants
me
to
go
out
to
that
clinic
too
whatever
you
do
just
stay
close
to
her
maria
said
finally
picking
up
the
tray
with
its
smoked
fish
and
teapot
covered
with
a
knit
cozy
she
may
not
have
that
long
maria
had
a
seer
mystical
bent
that
sometimes
troubled
ally
what
if
she
was
right
it
was
moments
like
this
when
ally
truly
missed
having
someone
special
in
her
life
chapter
april
the
afternoon
was
waning
when
ally
finally
headed
back
downtown
days
like
today
she
could
help
coining
away
buoyed
feeling
her
mom
was
going
to
be
cogent
forever
in
fact
ally
was
more
worried
about
herself
just
now
about
two
she
started
feeling
that
sensation
in
her
chest
again
but
she
had
wanted
her
mother
or
maria
to
know
she
was
using
vasodilator
medication
she
casually
said
her
farewells
and
got
down
to
the
car
and
was
sitting
behind
the
wheel
before
she
popped
a
nitro
tab
she
immediately
felt
okay
again
and
as
she
drove
down
broadway
heading
for
her
office
she
reviewed
all
that
had
happened
after
their
brunch
of
smoked
fish
and
onion
chutney
and
soda
bread
and
a
pot
of
earl
grey
she
tried
to
sell
her
mother
on
a
trip
to
the
bahamas
with
maria
joining
them
soon
maybe
at
the
beginning
of
summer
she
wanted
nina
to
spend
some
time
thinking
about
it
but
she
did
want
to
wait
too
long
was
this
just
going
to
be
a
distraction
at
the
end
of
nina
life
god
she
did
want
to
think
so
she
wanted
to
think
of
it
as
a
rebonding
nina
had
always
liked
to
revisit
the
devonshire
countryside
of
her
childhood
in
midsummer
when
arthur
could
take
time
off
always
for
just
a
week
but
it
was
as
intensively
planned
as
a
major
military
campaign
her
favorite
thing
was
to
trek
among
the
hedgerows
and
stone
fences
making
charcoal
sketches
on
brown
bags
in
the
evenings
they
would
dine
at
a
country
inn
they
went
with
local
favorites
like
kidney
pie
then
they
would
stroll
the
country
lanes
in
the
moonlight
as
a
family
no
tv
and
she
and
grant
hated
everything
about
the
trips
booooring
but
that
was
long
ago
and
far
away
when
she
and
grant
were
still
kids
now
her
mom
would
surely
want
something
restful
and
some
guaranteed
sunshine
would
hurt
either
already
she
had
an
idea
why
not
rent
a
house
with
a
private
pool
say
on
paradise
island
where
nina
could
spend
a
couple
of
hours
each
afternoon
in
the
casino
she
always
loved
casinos
and
never
missed
a
chance
to
hit
the
blackjack
tables
if
she
was
anywhere
near
one
her
loss
limit
was
a
hundred
dollars
but
she
actually
beat
the
house
more
often
than
not
the
teatime
scotch
had
impaired
her
skills
nina
appeared
to
like
the
idea
so
ally
had
started
making
up
a
schedule
in
her
head
the
beginning
of
summer
would
be
in
the
caribbean
and
there
should
be
some
real
bargains
to
be
had
she
made
a
mental
note
to
ask
glenda
her
assertive
travel
agent
at
empress
to
start
trolling
for
a
package
what
was
ally
really
thinking
hoping
she
was
fantasizing
she
could
heal
nina
all
by
herself
she
so
desperately
wanted
to
she
had
a
premonition
she
could
will
it
to
happen
when
she
saw
her
mom
on
good
days
she
always
found
herself
believing
she
could
somehow
make
all
her
days
good
she
was
sure
of
it
against
all
odds
what
she
was
sure
about
was
what
her
mother
really
thought
about
grant
proposal
to
enroll
her
in
this
clinic
in
new
jersey
was
this
doctor
miracle
stem
cell
cure
based
on
a
real
medical
advance
or
was
he
some
kind
of
charlatan
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
find
out
more
about
this
supposed
medical
magician
karl
van
de
vliet
the
envelope
grant
gave
her
was
still
lying
there
on
her
breakfast
bar
unopened
she
told
herself
she
read
it
the
minute
she
got
home
tonight
when
the
day
work
was
over
and
she
could
concentrate
the
sunday
office
the
job
she
had
on
her
mind
was
behind
schedule
and
she
was
feeling
a
lot
of
pressure
it
was
for
a
norwegian
couple
in
their
he
was
a
software
programmer
working
in
new
york
restructured
silicon
alley
and
she
was
teaching
at
the
fashion
institute
of
technology
together
they
pulled
down
over
thou
a
year
and
they
decided
to
stop
throwing
away
money
on
obscene
new
york
rents
they
bought
an
entire
floor
actually
three
small
apartments
of
what
was
formerly
a
tenement
in
the
west
fifties
an
area
once
known
as
hell
kitchen
but
now
much
gentrified
and
renamed
clinton
they
had
dreams
of
an
loft
of
the
kind
made
famous
in
soho
when
artists
took
over
abandoned
factory
buildings
and
gutted
the
space
taking
out
all
the
walls
because
they
had
combined
three
apartments
they
had
to
file
their
plans
with
the
nyc
department
of
buildings
and
modify
the
certificate
of
occupancy
to
reflect
the
change
in
the
number
of
dwelling
units
so
far
so
good
but
then
a
woman
who
was
the
local
member
of
the
district
council
got
wind
of
the
project
and
sent
someone
from
her
office
to
look
over
the
place
the
next
day
the
department
of
buildings
approval
of
their
plans
was
abruptly
withdrawn
it
turned
out
that
there
was
an
obscure
law
on
the
books
concerning
clinton
one
that
even
the
department
of
buildings
was
only
vaguely
aware
of
it
said
that
in
order
to
preserve
the
family
character
of
the
neighborhood
no
renovation
could
alter
the
number
of
rooms
in
a
residential
building
not
the
number
of
apartments
mind
you
just
the
number
of
rooms
that
was
when
they
showed
up
at
citispace
in
despair
they
wanted
ally
to
help
them
by
doing
some
kind
of
design
that
would
satisfy
the
law
and
also
give
them
the
open
airy
feeling
they
had
set
their
hopes
on
on
the
face
of
it
their
two
goals
seemed
mutually
contradictory
and
impossible
he
was
short
and
shy
and
she
was
plump
and
sassy
and
ally
liked
them
both
a
lot
sometimes
in
this
business
she
sensed
she
was
helping
people
realize
their
dreams
and
that
was
a
very
rewarding
feeling
real
estate
was
an
emotional
thing
your
home
was
a
part
of
you
she
always
tried
to
get
to
know
people
before
she
did
any
designs
for
them
sometimes
design
was
more
psychology
than
anything
else
but
this
time
she
had
to
solve
a
problem
before
she
could
wax
creative
if
their
plan
for
open
space
could
be
stopped
by
some
obscure
local
provision
that
even
the
department
of
buildings
was
fuzzy
about
then
maybe
there
was
some
other
obscure
law
in
the
housing
code
that
could
be
used
to
fight
back
the
full
code
had
recently
been
put
on
the
nyc
web
site
so
she
wanted
to
go
over
every
page
and
see
what
she
could
come
up
with
and
she
wanted
to
do
it
in
the
office
undisturbed
with
all
the
architectural
plans
close
to
hand
the
office
was
deserted
when
she
cruised
in
and
clicked
on
the
lights
she
got
on
the
expansive
nyc
web
site
and
started
poring
over
the
housing
code
though
she
was
still
obsessing
about
nina
what
if
this
doctor
in
new
jersey
actually
could
do
something
for
her
finish
here
she
told
herself
and
then
go
home
and
read
the
guy
cv
a
pot
of
decaf
coffee
later
she
came
across
a
fact
which
she
now
vaguely
remembered
from
her
days
as
a
practicing
architect
if
you
installed
a
drop
across
a
ceiling
that
was
technically
a
wall
in
the
eyes
of
the
nyc
department
of
buildings
the
space
on
each
side
became
a
separate
room
as
they
say
in
the
movies
bingo
in
fact
why
not
do
a
honeycomb
ceiling
that
would
actually
simulate
the
industrial
look
they
were
seeking
anyway
the
ceiling
was
over
eleven
feet
high
there
was
plenty
of
vertical
space
nobody
would
know
it
was
just
a
sneaky
way
to
get
around
a
funny
local
aberration
in
the
building
code
i
brilliant
she
thought
yes
dad
would
be
proud
she
made
some
sketches
and
by
that
time
it
was
after
six
time
to
go
home
knickers
was
waiting
by
the
door
and
she
gave
ally
a
dirty
look
and
some
very
disapproving
barks
by
way
of
penance
ally
took
her
on
an
extra
long
walk
all
the
way
up
to
fourteenth
street
and
back
then
she
picked
up
some
tuna
salad
and
steamed
veggies
from
a
new
deli
on
west
tenth
street
as
she
settled
down
to
eat
at
the
breakfast
bar
she
felt
like
a
single
mom
always
eating
and
doing
everything
on
the
run
and
all
she
had
to
worry
about
was
a
friendly
dog
how
did
real
working
moms
do
it
it
was
just
past
nine
when
she
poured
a
glass
of
chardonnay
and
picked
up
grant
envelope
and
took
it
into
the
living
room
pausing
to
put
some
chopin
ballades
on
the
cd
player
the
envelope
contained
a
bound
folder
that
was
karl
van
de
curriculum
vitae
his
resume
it
was
in
fact
a
minibiography
that
devoted
a
page
to
each
of
his
career
turns
his
life
story
was
presented
from
a
view
as
though
it
were
a
novel
karl
van
de
vliet
had
done
his
undergraduate
studies
at
the
prestigious
university
of
maastricht
after
which
he
migrated
to
the
united
states
and
taken
a
in
molecular
genetics
from
the
university
of
chicago
top
of
the
class
following
that
he
went
to
yale
as
a
postdoctoral
fellow
again
studying
genetics
from
the
beginning
he
focused
his
research
on
the
mechanisms
that
govern
human
cell
reproduction
along
the
way
he
become
interested
in
something
known
as
the
hayflick
limit
which
concerned
the
number
of
times
a
cell
could
divide
before
it
became
senescent
and
ceased
to
replicate
this
natural
life
span
controlled
the
aging
process
of
every
organism
and
it
seemed
to
be
nature
device
for
nipping
undesirable
mutant
cells
in
the
bud
by
never
letting
any
cell
unhealthy
or
healthy
just
keep
on
replicating
indefinitely
however
there
were
immortal
cells
buried
within
us
all
stem
cells
that
could
replicate
forever
unchanged
they
were
present
at
the
very
beginning
of
life
and
all
our
differing
body
tissue
was
created
from
them
some
still
lingered
on
in
our
body
as
though
to
be
available
for
spare
parts
if
one
could
figure
out
how
to
transfer
the
characteristics
of
those
cells
to
other
cells
then
the
possibility
existed
that
we
could
regenerate
damaged
or
aging
tissue
in
our
vital
organs
the
trick
was
to
figure
out
the
mechanism
whereby
stem
cells
managed
to
cheat
time
his
research
which
was
accompanied
by
a
flurry
of
scientific
papers
was
celebrated
and
encouraging
after
three
years
he
was
lured
away
from
yale
to
become
a
faculty
member
at
johns
hopkins
which
offered
to
double
his
laboratory
budget
he
was
there
for
six
years
during
which
time
he
met
camille
buseine
a
neurosurgeon
finishing
her
residency
she
had
a
doctorate
from
a
medical
institute
near
paris
and
she
was
doing
research
that
was
similar
to
his
so
the
biography
said
they
married
and
became
a
team
and
when
he
was
asked
by
harvard
medical
to
found
a
department
for
molecular
genetics
she
was
immediately
offered
a
tenured
position
there
too
harvard
considered
it
a
double
coup
his
research
was
zeroing
in
on
the
telomerase
protein
an
enzyme
many
scientists
believed
was
responsible
for
suppressing
the
aging
process
in
stem
cells
could
it
be
used
to
regenerate
tissue
he
was
well
along
on
the
task
of
exploring
that
tantalizing
possibility
when
tragedy
struck
camille
who
had
worked
around
the
clock
during
her
residency
at
johns
hopkins
began
feeling
weak
at
harvard
and
was
diagnosed
with
acquired
aortic
stenosis
after
a
struggle
she
died
during
a
severe
cardiac
episode
my
god

thought
that
what
i
have
after
camille
died
he
left
harvard
and
its
academic
obligations
and
went
to
work
at
a
research
institute
affiliated
with
stanford
university
he
even
formed
a
paper
company
to
structure
the
work
the
gerex
corporation
but
then
there
came
a
second
strike
against
him
he
was
doing
research
using
embryonic
stem
cells
obtained
from
the
discarded
embryos
at
fertility
clinics
after
two
years
of
harassment
by
political
groups
stanford
decided
his
research
was
too
controversial
and
terminated
his
funding
three
months
later
karl
van
de
vliet
merged
his
company
with
bartlett
medical
devices
and
moved
his
research
staff
east
to
new
jersey
to
the
dorian
institute
that
was
five
years
past
and
now
his
research
using
stem
cells
was
in
nih
clinical
trials
the
official
history
ended
there
though
with
a
strong
hint
that
the
final
chapter
was
yet
to
be
written
then
at
the
back
there
was
a
bibliography
of
publications
that
extended
for
eight
pages
and
included
a
summary
of
the
most
important
papers
his
work
on
stem
cells
and
the
telomerase
enzyme
appeared
to
be
at
the
forefront
of
the
field
oddly
however
some
of
his
writings
also
were
philosophical
an
argument
with
himself
whether
his
work
could
be
misused
to
alter
the
natural
limitations
life
imposes
one
of
those
papers
from
a
conference
presentation
in
copenhagen
had
a
summary
and
in
it
he
pondered
whether
the
use
of
stem
cells
to
rejuvenate
the
body
might
someday
give
medical
science
godlike
powers
the
greeks
he
declared
had
a
myth
about
the
punishment
reserved
for
those
who
sought
to
defeat
our
natural
life
span
when
the
goddess
of
the
dawn
aurora
fell
in
love
with
the
beautiful
youth
tithonus
and
granted
him
immortality
it
turned
out
to
be
a
curse
since
he
still
reached
the
decrepitude
of
age
but
had
to
suffer
on
forever
because
he
could
not
have
the
release
of
death
but
van
de
vliet
pondered
if
we
could
find
a
way
to
arrest
the
aging
process
in
our
body
tissue
might
we
escape
the
process
of
aging
if
so
was
this
a
good
thing
or
might
this
be
a
step
too
far
that
would
bring
on
unintended
and
as
yet
unknown
consequences
ally
thought
would
mind
having
mom
mind
restored
or
my
own
heart
for
that
matter
in
all
karl
van
de
vliet
was
clearly
a
genius
he
also
was
a
very
complex
man
but
might
he
be
a
very
gifted
huckster
as
well
the
inside
back
cover
had
a
group
photo
showing
him
surrounded
by
members
of
his
research
staff
all
in
white
lab
coats
there
were
two
men
and
two
women
and
each
was
identified
along
with
a
list
of
his
or
her
academic
credentials
they
were
standing
on
the
porch
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
mansion
which
had
large
doric
columns
in
greek
revival
style
the
lettering
in
the
marble
above
their
heads
read
the
dorian
institute
she
put
down
the
folder
and
went
into
the
kitchen
and
poured
herself
another
glass
of
wine
finishing
off
the
botde
her
mind
was
chinning
but
not
because
of
the
words
on
the
page
it
was
that
photograph
at
the
back
it
was
dated
less
than
two
years
ago
his
at
the
university
of
chicago
was
granted
in
but
even
if
he
was
a
genius
and
got
his
first
doctorate
in
his
early
twenties
still
have
to
be
what
at
least
sixty
years
old
by
now
probably
halfway
to
seventy
in
the
photo
he
looks
no
more
than
forty
well
at
most
what
the
heck
is
going
on
went
back
into
the
living
room
and
picked
up
the
brochure
and
stared
at
it
he
had
sandy
hair
that
lay
like
a
mane
above
his
elongated
brow
he
was
tall
and
gaunt
with
high
cheeks
and
deep
penetrating
eyes
but
no
matter
how
you
gauged
him
the
guy
had
aged
a
day
since
his
birthday
tops
so
what
going
on
that
is
in
the
package
she
checked
the
digital
clock
on
the
side
table
the
hour
was
pushing
ten
and
decided
to
give
grant
a
call
three
chirps
and
then
yo
hampton
here
my
god
she
thought
he
even
does
it
at
home
that
synthetic
bravado
was
left
over
from
his
trader
days
the
luckiest
person
alive
just
to
have
reached
me
how
can
i
further
make
your
day
his
tone
implied
grant
it
me
i
think
it
time
for
that
vital
chat
it
took
him
a
split
second
to
recover
and
then
hey
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
what
happened
to
you
if
you
were
going
to
stand
me
up
or
what
not
call
like
you
said
you
would
long
day
i
was
up
at
mom
this
morning
you
knew
she
was
going
to
tell
me
right
about
your
little
surprise
visit
and
proposal
i
had
a
hunch
the
topic
might
arise
his
voice
seemed
to
shrug
nonchalantly
i
thought
you
should
hear
it
from
her
instead
of
from
me
so
what
do
you
think
what
do
i
think
i
think
i
wondering
what
you
up
to
i
not
to
anything
ally
except
exactly
what
i
told
her
trouble
is
i
do
know
whether
she
got
it
i
wanted
to
see
how
she
was
doing
you
know
i
thinking
maybe
vee
can
do
something
for
her
but
i
had
to
see
her
first
she
seemed
pretty
distant
but
that
woman
there
what
was
her
name
marie
maria
whatever
said
she
has
lucid
moments
so
who
knows
he
might
possibly
help
her
i
think
i
can
arrange
to
get
her
into
his
clinic
bartlett
gives
me
a
few
perks
the
least
i
can
do
for
her
so
his
voice
trailed
off
expectantly
grant
i
need
to
talk
to
you
about
this
man
i
read
the
stuff
you
gave
me
and
i
still
do
know
the
first
thing
about
him
she
paused
about
to
speak
words
she
never
thought
she
would
if
you
want
to
come
over
i
stand
you
a
drink
you
serious
for
my
sins
i
grab
a
cab
see
you
in
fifteen
it
begun
she
thought
i
about
to
let
grant
screw
up
my
life
one
more
time
no
this
round
do
give
him
the
chance
stay
ahead
of
him
april
i
did
know
if
i
should
have
brought
a
bodyguard
he
was
saying
as
he
strode
in
the
door
a
master
of
the
universe
with
a
leather
jacket
slung
over
his
shoulder
he
looked
stylish
but
then
he
always
did
he
casually
tossed
the
jacket
onto
the
gray
couch
then
gazed
around
thankfully
he
did
try
the
new
york
cheek
kiss
i
guess
this
is
not
supposed
to
seem
like
old
times
but
somehow
it
does
seeing
you
again
hey
we
still
blood
kin
right
do
push
it
grant
she
killed
the
chopin
and
put
on
a
bach
sonata
clear
precise
thinking
was
required
not
sentimentality
knickers
had
rushed
to
give
grant
a
hello
nuzzle
happier
to
see
him
than
ally
was
whatever
this
is
it
is
definitely
not
old
times
he
sauntered
into
her
kitchen
looking
around
trying
to
act
cool
but
clearly
ill
at
ease
you
done
a
nice
job
on
this
place
sis
he
was
looking
over
the
rustic
counter
she
installed
you
get
a
deal
on
the
space
a
bank
repo
or
something
the
people
who
had
it
wanted
to
sell
fast
and
i
made
them
an
offer
not
that
it
was
any
of
his
damned
business
why
did
she
treat
the
question
with
the
scorn
it
deserved
she
had
an
old
fifth
of
dewar
in
the
cabinet
she
poured
him
some
over
ice
then
gave
herself
a
shot
of
tequila
neat
to
sip
she
loved
the
pure
agave
flavor
the
more
she
thought
about
the
situation
the
more
she
was
sure
she
needed
it
he
picked
up
his
scotch
then
walked
into
the
living
room
and
helped
himself
to
the
couch
ally
i
know
why
you
ticked
and
i
blame
you
i
feel
crummy
about
dad
i
really
do
i
guess
i
share
some
of
the
blame
he
was
trying
to
sound
contrite
but
the
reading
did
not
quite
rise
to
the
minimal
threshold
of
credibility
you
with
whom
you
prick
nobody
else
was
involved
he
mortgaged
citispace
to
the
hilt
and
settled
those
fraud
suits
to
keep
you
from
losing
your
license
or
worse
you
destroyed
his
business
and
his
life
all
by
yourself
he
looked
as
contrite
as
she
ever
seen
him
look
i
thought
the
business
plan
i
had
would
work
out
i
really
did
i
was
managing
discretionary
accounts
but
the
bond
market
hit
a
downdraft
when
i
was
long
a
few
of
my
clients
did
have
the
balls
to
ride
it
out
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
that
i
feel
like
a
complete
cretin
over
what
happened
that
a
day
does
go
by
that
i
do
hate
myself
for
it
his
eyes
went
dead
and
he
seemed
to
shrivel
his
body
becoming
visibly
smaller
well
i
do
more
than
you
ever
know
you
did
seem
all
that
contrite
at
the
time
i
was
operating
in
a
high
state
of
denial
back
then
but
now
i
want
to
take
a
shot
at
growing
up
i
want
to
start
trying
to
make
up
for
all
that
if
you
just
cut
me
a
little
slack
and
give
me
a
chance
grant
you
working
for
bartlett
enterprises
doing
whatever
it
is
you
do
fine
that
your
job
but
now
you
want
me
to
become
a
guinea
pig
when
this
dutch
doctor
needs
one
in
a
crunch
or
maybe
mom
too
for
all
i
know
maybe
he
needs
her
as
well
two
guinea
pigs
so
do
try
to
make
this
about
me
and
her
let
keep
it
honest
it
really
about
you
just
like
always
ally
a
lot
of
things
have
gone
on
since
dad
passed
away
changed
in
more
ways
than
you
could
ever
imagine
he
was
all
sincerity
now
his
demeanor
rapidly
evolving
to
fit
the
current
vibes
of
the
scene
i
not
like
i
used
to
be
i
really
mean
that
learned
learned
that
i
ca
always
just
be
thinking
about
myself
so
what
changed
you
the
truth
was
he
did
seem
different
in
some
way
she
could
quite
understand
but
he
was
always
talking
about
turning
over
a
new
leaf
especially
whenever
he
just
gotten
himself
in
trouble
that
part
had
changed
at
all
ally
van
der
vliet
i
do
know
how
much
i
should
tell
you
but
he
a
miracle
worker
he
paused
and
looked
down
at
his
scotch
one
thing
about
him
was
definitely
different
she
thought
there
was
a
lot
less
bravado
and
swagger
the
thing
is
what
he
doing
is
so
powerful
i
not
sure
which
worries
me
most
that
it
not
true
that
it
just
some
placebo
effect
or
that
it
is
true
when
i
think
about
the
implications
his
voice
trailed
off
again
go
on
she
could
tell
he
was
dead
serious
it
not
something
i
sure
i
should
talk
about
he
reached
over
and
touched
her
hand
but
it
working
i
swear
he
doing
things
that
should
even
be
possible
she
thought
pulling
her
hand
away
grant
please
tell
me
exactly
what
you
think
he
could
do
for
mom
she
was
sure
she
should
be
having
this
conversation
you
want
her
to
go
out
to
the
dorian
institute
right
where
he
does
his
and
i
take
it
that
where
you
want
me
to
go
too
it
in
northern
jersey
about
an
hour
drive
from
the
city
maybe
not
even
if
traffic
light
but
i
only
want
mom
to
go
if
you
say
it
okay
i
not
trying
to
do
anything
behind
your
back
she
breathed
a
long
sigh
trying
to
clear
her
brain
every
other
word
he
uttered
was
probably
part
of
some
hustle
but
what
was
it
why
do
we
start
at
the
beginning
grant
i
read
his
cv
and
believe
me
i
got
a
lot
of
questions
for
starters
how
did
he
convince
winston
bartlett
to
bankroll
him
she
took
another
sip
of
her
tequila
then
set
it
down
you
his
flunky
now
so
you
should
be
able
to
answer
that
question
you
read
the
materials
i
left
just
finished
them
then
you
know
he
lost
his
federal
funding
at
stanford
a
few
years
back
when
he
was
at
a
critical
stage
of
his
research
using
stem
cells
that
when
he
came
to
the
man
and
persuaded
him
to
put
up
the
money
to
help
him
take
everything
private
the
only
way
bartlett
would
play
ball
was
if
he
could
buy
the
gerex
corporation
and
get
interest
in
all
the
patents
van
de
vliet
kept
the
other
quarter
but
now
they
both
hoping
to
sell
off
percent
to
a
big
pharmaceutical
company
not
american
i
ca
tell
you
any
more
than
that
congratulations
she
said
sounds
like
your
job
is
secure
yeah
right
that
twitch
of
nonchalance
he
had
when
something
really
mattered
even
as
a
child
he
would
attempt
and
fail
trying
not
to
gloat
over
some
personal
success
it
was
moments
like
this
when
she
realized
missed
seeing
him
and
talking
to
him
when
you
cut
a
family
member
off
from
you
you
also
cut
yourself
off
from
them
after
all
he
was
her
closest
blood
kin
even
though
he
was
an
unreconstructed
shit
at
some
level
she
wished
she
could
get
past
the
bitterness
she
felt
toward
him
could
it
be
he
really
had
changed
he
did
like
the
way
the
scene
was
going
what
the
hell
was
her
problem
he
looked
at
his
scotch
longingly
then
got
up
and
went
to
the
kitchen
and
got
another
ice
cube
for
it
go
easy
how
was
he
going
to
get
through
to
her
if
word
of
the
beta
got
out
the
buyout
was
toast
and
grant
hampton
along
with
it
but
if
ally
could
be
brought
in
grant
she
was
saying
i
want
to
start
off
by
asking
you
if
ever
taken
a
really
good
look
at
that
guy
karl
van
de
vliet
does
he
look
anything
like
his
picture
the
one
that
came
with
that
cv
of
his
sure
that
him
and
i
assume
you
actually
read
his
resume
of
course
here
it
comes
he
thought
the
thing
everybody
asks
if
those
dates
are
right
then
he
has
to
be
what
at
least
sixty
years
old
but
in
the
picture
he
does
look
a
day
over
so
what
going
on
ally
you
finally
getting
it
he
rattled
the
ice
in
his
dewar
then
finally
took
a
deep
sip
maybe
he
thought
it
would
help
with
the
courage
he
a
truly
amazing
human
being
that
not
an
answer
grant
it
a
generality
she
exhaled
in
obvious
exasperation
but
i
want
an
honest
answer
about
one
thing
dammit
do
you
actually
think
he
could
help
mom
alzheimer
maybe
even
reverse
it
tell
me
the
truth
just
once
ally
i
ca
guarantee
anything
but
it
worth
a
shot
now
he
thought
hopefully
she
was
sounding
like
she
was
starting
to
come
around
thank
god
as
for
whether
vee
could
cure
the
old
bird
who
knew
but
he
overheard
the
nurses
talking
about
how
he
and
his
research
staff
had
had
some
phenomenal
luck
with
alzheimer
by
the
way
what
happened
when
you
talked
to
mom
he
went
on
did
she
seem
like
she
understood
anything
i
told
her
grant
she
probably
understood
a
lot
more
than
you
wanted
her
to
the
bad
part
is
she
let
you
give
her
some
hope
now
what
going
to
happen
if
she
goes
out
there
and
ends
up
being
disappointed
it
a
real
possibility
he
told
himself
but
it
probably
the
only
way
i
ever
get
you
out
there
and
that
what
really
matters
ally
we
never
know
unless
you
should
go
too
look
maybe
i
talk
to
van
de
vliet
but
it
purely
gathering
she
was
staring
at
him
so
why
not
tell
me
the
whole
story
are
you
doing
this
for
mom
and
me
or
are
we
just
being
used
like
lab
animals
i
not
sure
you
going
to
believe
anything
i
say
he
sipped
again
at
his
scotch
then
walked
over
to
the
skylight
and
looked
up
finally
he
turned
back
after
dad
and
everything
i
had
trouble
sleeping
i
know
you
did
think
it
got
to
me
but
it
was
like
some
bad
force
had
taken
over
my
mind
haunting
me
i
became
obsessed
with
death
i
took
off
two
months
and
went
to
colorado
camping
out
there
under
the
stars
i
did
a
lot
of
thinking
dad
had
died
suddenly
but
maybe
that
was
a
blessing
in
disguise
the
rest
of
us
we
all
die
a
little
every
day
why
does
time
do
the
things
to
us
it
does
why
do
we
have
to
grow
old
and
repulsive
he
drew
on
his
scotch
again
then
continued
when
i
came
back
i
started
doing
research
on
aging
that
when
karl
van
de
vliet
name
popped
up
on
the
internet
some
paper
he
given
in
vienna
years
ago
it
was
about
the
physiology
of
aging
but
then
tanya
came
along
and
i
sort
of
forgot
about
him
then
when
i
went
to
work
for
winston
bartlett
there
he
was
the
very
same
guy
it
was
weird
but
it
was
as
though
god
had
delivered
him
is
this
story
going
to
end
up
being
about
why
he
looks
so
young
i
getting
there
he
smiled
i
kept
wondering
too
and
then
finally
i
saw
an
opening
in
his
schedule
and
took
him
to
dinner
here
in
the
city
down
at
chanterelle
a
social
thing
eventually
after
a
couple
of
bottles
of
serious
wine
it
came
out
that
once
upon
a
time
he
had
done
an
unconventional
experiment
on
himself
it
was
sort
of
an
accident
something
about
melanoma
research
so
he
you
asked
me
why
he
looks
so
young
well
some
procedure
he
did
apparently
stopped
his
skin
from
aging
but
then
he
changed
the
subject
and
would
talk
about
it
anymore
so
do
i
think
he
a
miracle
worker
i
say
he
walking
proof
of
something
that
you
can
cheat
nature
and
there
is
no
that
all
i
know
he
came
back
and
settled
onto
the
couch
his
scotch
glass
was
empty
and
he
yearned
for
another
but
that
small
voice
inside
was
urging
discretion
this
was
the
moment
that
could
be
make
or
break
but
to
get
back
to
you
ally
you
really
should
meet
him
i
ca
talk
specifics
about
the
actual
clinical
trials
but
let
me
just
say
they
been
very
positive
there
every
reason
to
think
he
can
help
you
and
mom
too
he
studied
her
trying
to
read
her
mind
he
wondered
if
she
could
detect
the
anxiety
he
felt
lurking
just
beneath
the
surface
was
she
seeing
through
him
the
way
nina
for
all
her
mental
debility
had
seemed
to
grant
has
this
doctor
van
de
vliet
gotten
into
some
kind
of
medical
experiment
that
turned
into
a
faustian
bargain
is
his
skin
rejuvenation
a
signal
that
this
research
has
gone
over
into
the
twilight
zone
when
a
man
looks
there
got
to
be
an
unnatural
act
going
on
what
does
it
mean
maybe
it
means
he
found
the
thing
ponce
de
leon
was
looking
for
the
fountain
of
youth
or
whatever
then
he
probably
have
to
pay
for
it
some
other
way
she
said
getting
up
mother
nature
does
give
out
freebies
look
i
got
to
give
knickers
her
midnight
walk
that
your
exit
cue
i
call
him
tomorrow
i
go
that
far
do
blow
this
chance
ally
he
said
setting
down
his
empty
scotch
glass
and
getting
up
he
felt
hope
and
it
bucked
him
up
it
could
be
the
biggest
mistake
of
your
life
and
mom
he
was
at
the
door
before
he
turned
back
it
was
time
for
the
insurance
the
hedging
of
bets
bartlett
had
authorized
it
by
the
way
i
almost
forgot
jesus
i
going
senile
myself
told
me
to
tell
you
he
like
you
to
come
over
to
his
place
on
gramercy
park
tomorrow
morning
around
ten
if
you
can
work
it
into
your
schedule
what
for
that
job
on
his
place
that
i
told
you
about
this
morning
i
guess
i
do
know
he
planning
to
renovate
the
ground
floor
but
just
between
us
he
also
got
a
massive
renovation
job
in
the
wings
so
maybe
that
what
really
on
and
this
is
like
an
audition
who
knows
he
bought
an
old
mansion
on
upper
park
and
he
planning
to
heavily
redo
it
and
turn
it
into
a
museum
for
his
incredible
collection
of
japanese
military
stuff
swords
and
armor
and
shit
he
going
to
do
over
the
entire
interior
it
part
architecture
and
part
design
so
i
gave
him
your
name
who
knows
but
i
was
over
at
his
place
this
afternoon
and
he
asked
about
you
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
you
as
soon
as
possible
he
even
gave
me
one
of
his
personal
cards
to
give
to
you
here
it
has
the
gramercy
park
address
and
his
private
cell
phone
just
like
that
she
looked
skeptical
but
took
the
card
winston
bartlett
is
not
a
man
who
dawdles
if
he
decides
he
wants
to
do
something
he
just
moves
on
it
all
he
asked
was
that
you
bring
a
portfolio
to
show
him
some
of
your
work
on
and
do
it
he
thought
as
he
headed
out
the
door
and
see
the
man
just
fucking
do
it
if
he
ca
close
this
frigging
deal
nobody
can
chapter
april
winston
bartlett
put
the
newly
glazed
creme
brulee
still
warm
from
his
preparation
in
the
kitchen
below
stairs
on
the
bed
tray
in
front
of
kristen
next
to
her
untouched
champagne
flute
she
used
to
love
it
and
he
was
trying
everything
he
knew
to
jog
her
memory
he
cooked
her
favorite
supper
eggs
florentine
with
barely
wilted
spinach
topped
by
prosciutto
had
taken
her
to
bed
and
now
there
was
champagne
and
her
favorite
dessert
but
she
still
seemed
distracted
and
distant
yes
it
was
a
good
idea
to
get
her
away
from
the
institute
but
that
was
merely
relocating
the
problem
not
fixing
it
if
it
could
be
fixed
in
the
meantime
she
had
to
be
kept
here
out
of
the
public
eye
thank
you
she
said
and
gingerly
took
a
small
bite
she
had
been
almost
lucid
earlier
this
evening
and
was
leaning
against
the
antique
headboard
wearing
a
soft
blue
nightgown
her
long
blond
hair
was
tousled
and
down
over
her
breasts
her
memory
might
now
be
a
sometime
thing
but
her
libido
was
still
going
strong
do
you
remember
how
much
you
used
to
like
that
he
asked
trying
to
make
eye
contact
she
nodded
her
head
dumbly
did
she
actually
remember
increasingly
he
had
no
idea
he
had
brought
her
here
to
stay
in
this
century
mansion
on
park
avenue
he
purchased
it
a
year
and
a
half
earlier
for
million
and
he
was
intending
to
have
it
renovated
and
converted
into
a
museum
that
renovation
however
had
been
put
on
hold
awaiting
a
decision
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
metropolitan
museum
he
wanted
the
building
to
be
a
park
avenue
adjunct
to
the
met
and
he
also
wanted
his
definitive
assemblage
of
japanese
implements
of
war
to
be
known
as
the
bartlett
collection
the
tax
would
be
monumental
but
that
was
not
nearly
so
important
as
the
prestige
it
was
clear
now
that
this
project
would
not
have
any
momentum
until
he
first
got
himself
appointed
to
the
board
of
the
met
unfortunately
money
alone
was
adequate
politics
was
involved
he
was
working
on
it
with
a
lot
of
upper
east
side
lunches
and
targeted
charity
events
he
was
also
taking
his
time
and
getting
designs
and
estimates
for
the
renovation
the
way
things
were
at
the
moment
he
did
have
the
cash
to
actually
start
construction
anyway
for
the
moment
the
place
was
furnished
but
unoccupied
except
for
a
security
guard
a
part
of
bartlett
personal
staff
now
with
kristen
here
discretion
was
his
uppermost
concern
he
had
sent
the
security
guy
home
this
evening
so
he
and
kristen
could
have
privacy
in
the
morning
two
nurses
would
come
on
duty
one
to
look
after
her
and
another
to
cook
over
the
past
year
he
brought
her
here
most
weekends
it
was
like
having
their
own
best
of
all
unlike
his
official
residence
on
gramercy
park
he
did
have
a
wife
upstairs
like
some
mad
in
every
sense
of
the
word
aunt
in
the
attic
he
had
hoped
that
bringing
kristen
back
here
might
do
something
for
her
memory
he
still
hoped
but
he
was
sure
in
bed
tonight
she
had
been
as
lithe
and
enthusiastic
as
ever
possibly
even
more
so
did
she
know
who
he
was
he
could
really
tell
but
he
still
loved
being
with
her
the
soft
skin
and
the
voluptuous
curves
of
her
breasts
and
thighs
it
made
him
feel
young
again
since
she
had
been
out
at
the
dorian
institute
and
away
from
him
he
had
begun
to
feel
older
and
older
winston
bartlett
was
and
increasingly
felt
it
to
begin
with
his
prostate
was
enlarging
itself
in
spite
of
all
the
special
expensive
medicines
he
used
surgery
was
increasingly
looking
like
a
possibility
and
his
memory
was
nowhere
near
what
it
once
was
he
wolfed
down
ginkgo
and
ginseng
capsules
by
the
handful
but
was
finding
it
harder
and
harder
to
remember
people
names
particularly
the
new
wave
of
politicians
who
fawned
over
him
and
then
there
was
the
matter
of
teeth
he
just
gone
through
major
periodontal
surgery
a
sign
of
aging
gums
how
long
before
his
ivories
would
be
replaced
by
ceramic
choppers
oh
and
the
heart
his
cardiologist
was
talking
more
and
more
about
stents
to
alleviate
the
two
constricted
arteries
in
the
left
ventricle
they
were
already
down
to
percent
face
it
his
whole
damned
body
was
falling
apart
probably
worst
of
all
the
johnson
was
far
from
what
it
used
to
be
not
long
back
it
was
a
daily
triple
threat
soon
he
might
be
resorting
to
viagra
as
more
than
a
discretionary
recreational
drug
something
he
was
still
joking
about
less
than
a
year
ago
the
dirty
secret
about
living
this
long
is
after
you
seen
everything
you
ever
wanted
to
see
done
everything
you
ever
wanted
to
do
bought
everything
you
ever
wanted
to
buy
you
gradually
lose
the
only
thing
really
worth
having
youth
to
try
to
hang
on
to
it
he
had
been
through
clinics
as
flung
as
phoenix
and
lucerne
he
had
undergone
regimens
of
antioxidants
and
injections
of
human
growth
hormone
he
tried
testosterone
and
dehydroepiandrosterone
better
know
as
dhea
maybe
it
had
made
a
difference
maybe
not
sometimes
he
thought
he
had
more
libido
and
energy
but
other
times
he
was
sure
maybe
it
was
just
that
begun
working
out
even
harder
playing
handball
an
extra
half
hour
every
other
day
he
did
know
his
body
was
continuing
to
deteriorate
shit
the
beta
had
to
be
made
to
work
i
do
want
to
stay
here
alone
kristen
said
putting
down
her
spoon
i
want
to
go
back
to
work
honey
i
ca
be
here
all
the
time
and
you
really
not
well
enough
to
go
to
work
there
be
someone
here
with
you
it
just
till
you
get
better
he
studied
her
the
face
that
was
so
young
and
felt
the
full
weight
of
the
tragedy
sinking
in
do
you
remember
what
it
was
you
used
to
do
i
do
remember
right
now
i
mean
exactly
i
used
to
talk
to
people
i
was
in
this
room
with
lots
of
bright
lights
she
did
actually
remember
he
thought
her
former
producer
at
e
along
with
everybody
else
including
her
harridan
of
a
mother
katherine
had
been
told
she
was
at
a
private
health
spa
in
new
mexico
it
had
to
be
kept
that
way
no
one
must
know
she
was
here
all
the
phones
had
been
removed
before
the
ambulance
brought
her
starting
at
six
in
the
morning
there
would
be
a
nurse
and
a
downstairs
on
a
basis
under
no
conditions
could
she
be
allowed
to
leave
not
the
way
her
mind
was
now
kristy
it
was
supposed
to
turn
out
like
this
i
so
sorry
but
karl
is
doing
all
he
can
we
he
has
a
new
idea
that
he
about
to
explore
he
going
to
his
voice
trailed
off
as
he
stared
at
her
unblinking
eyes
you
do
remember
what
happened
do
you
but
how
she
looked
my
god
the
youth
how
could
a
true
miracle
have
such
a
tragic
downside
that
was
when
the
cell
phone
on
the
stand
beside
him
chirped
it
was
the
only
phone
in
the
place
and
tomorrow
it
would
be
gone
no
way
could
she
be
allowed
to
have
a
phone
the
caller
id
advised
that
it
was
grant
hampton
kristy
i
got
a
feeling
this
could
take
a
while
he
was
reaching
for
his
silk
robe
i
be
downstairs
on
the
first
floor
if
you
need
anything
okay
she
just
stared
at
him
mutely
he
shook
his
head
sadly
there
much
time
left
to
mend
her
how
in
god
name
had
it
come
to
this
as
he
moved
down
the
spiraling
grand
staircase
he
clicked
on
the
phone
yeah
i
was
just
at
her
place
i
actually
got
in
which
is
more
than
has
happened
in
over
four
years
i
think
she
on
board
but
i
still
not
entirely
sure
so
just
to
be
safe
i
told
her
you
wanted
to
see
her
tomorrow
are
you
saying
you
could
make
this
happen
with
your
own
fucking
sister
it
we
not
exactly
on
the
greatest
of
terms
ally
and
me
there
was
an
awkward
tone
in
his
voice
it
hard
to
explain
like
i
told
you
i
confirmed
her
blood
type
on
saturday
it
ab
like
i
thought
and
i
played
the
mother
angle
at
the
very
least
i
think
she
willing
to
drive
the
old
bird
out
to
the
institute
and
meet
karl
that
a
start
at
least
and
what
about
her
medical
karl
wanted
to
see
i
working
on
it
i
remembered
something
about
her
i
got
a
guy
he
going
to
check
on
it
tonight
good
bartlett
growled
there
no
time
to
screw
around
on
this
i
set
it
up
for
you
to
meet
her
tomorrow
the
way
you
wanted
i
think
she
show
i
told
the
one
who
really
should
talk
to
her
is
karl
bartlett
sighed
he
knows
how
to
handle
patients
then
he
could
call
her
tomorrow
after
she
talked
to
you
if
we
all
pull
together
on
this
i
sure
we
can
get
her
out
there
by
day
after
tomorrow
tuesday
winston
bartlett
looked
at
his
watch
it
had
just
turned
monday
one
less
day
to
find
something
that
would
stop
the
syndrome
in
its
tracks
we
better
he
was
clicking
off
the
phone
when
he
heard
a
wail
of
despair
from
the
bedroom
upstairs
and
the
sound
of
a
champagne
flute
being
thrown
against
a
wall
kristen
was
losing
it
rapidly
now
was
she
still
conscious
enough
to
know
what
was
happening
to
her
chapter
april
the
commute
from
ally
west
village
place
to
the
citispace
office
in
soho
was
normally
a
brisk
stroll
and
she
brought
knickers
with
her
a
lot
the
boss
prerogative
since
her
office
was
arguably
homier
than
her
home
knickers
loved
to
wander
around
and
she
thought
guard
the
computers
and
drafting
tables
this
morning
though
ally
had
an
appointment
for
her
at
pooch
pros
the
dog
groomers
near
her
office
a
wash
and
a
trim
and
plenty
of
pampering
betty
and
misha
always
fussed
over
her
shamelessly
and
she
gloried
in
it
but
now
a
pounding
rain
had
just
come
through
which
meant
no
walk
for
either
of
them
knickers
would
show
up
looking
like
a
bedraggled
mop
definitely
the
moment
to
take
the
car
alexa
hampton
liked
to
say
that
she
was
really
an
auto
person
hers
was
a
toyota
light
blue
and
its
modesty
befitted
her
needs
in
new
york
hopping
around
soho
and
the
village
it
made
a
lot
more
sense
to
rely
on
a
bike
or
on
cabs
or
just
plain
walk
garaging
a
car
in
new
york
cost
the
equivalent
of
a
studio
apartment
rental
in
most
normal
places
and
the
truth
was
she
resented
the
toyota
presence
in
her
life
but
there
were
moments
when
cabs
the
answer
and
this
was
one
of
them
fortunately
the
parking
garage
she
used
was
just
around
the
corner
so
she
and
knickers
got
there
before
being
totally
soaked
knickers
loved
riding
in
the
toyota
and
she
always
seemed
to
know
what
was
coming
the
minute
they
turned
the
corner
for
the
garage
this
morning
she
gave
a
gleeful
woof
and
started
panting
a
sure
indicator
of
joy
as
they
drove
the
few
blocks
downtown
the
rain
was
easing
up
but
the
streets
were
still
shiny
ally
reached
into
her
bag
and
took
out
the
personal
card
of
winston
bartlett
his
private
residence
was
on
gramercy
park
the
only
reason
he
could
possibly
want
to
meet
her
there
was
if
he
did
indeed
have
a
job
she
decided
she
would
call
him
from
the
office
and
confirm
the
appointment
assuming
he
still
remembered
it
then
she
get
jennifer
to
help
her
assemble
a
portfolio
of
their
work
and
make
a
color
copy
to
leave
with
him
she
leaned
over
and
rubbed
knickers
ears
her
thoughts
were
drifting
back
to
karl
van
de
vliet
at
some
level
his
stem
cell
technology
sounded
like
the
ultimate
snake
oil
was
she
about
to
take
leave
of
her
common
sense
to
go
to
see
him
or
even
to
consider
letting
him
perform
some
experimental
procedure
on
her
mother
mind
on
the
other
hand
what
about
him
what
kind
of
procedure
could
van
de
vliet
have
done
that
would
stop
his
own
skin
from
aging
if
grant
had
merely
told
her
that
karl
van
de
vliet
had
finally
realized
the
cosmetician
dream
and
learned
how
to
make
human
skin
youthful
and
supple
again
she
would
have
passed
it
off
as
just
more
wall
street
ipo
hyperbole
but
seeing
was
believing
and
it
also
seemed
like
there
was
a
lot
more
going
on
than
just
a
change
in
his
skin
there
was
something
about
him
in
his
eyes
that
felt
inconsistent
she
was
still
puzzling
on
that
point
when
knickers
jumped
up
and
barked
they
were
passing
a
garbage
truck
and
the
guys
were
banging
the
cans
into
the
back
shhh
she
reached
to
quiet
her
we
almost
there
baby
then
she
tugged
at
her
leash
and
settled
her
back
into
the
seat
since
the
rain
was
all
but
over
she
decided
to
park
the
car
where
she
dropped
knickers
off
and
then
walk
over
to
her
office
which
was
only
a
couple
of
blocks
east
she
found
a
spot
right
next
to
the
awning
of
pooch
pros
and
the
minute
knickers
was
liberated
from
the
car
she
bounded
to
the
door
dragging
her
leash
through
the
puddles
misha
was
already
there
to
meet
her
come
on
my
baby
my
beauty
he
reached
down
and
gave
her
a
big
hug
misha
was
a
gaunt
balding
russian
who
had
once
been
the
hero
of
the
soviet
olympic
swim
team
now
he
looked
like
he
could
stand
a
piroshki
or
two
to
plump
him
up
you
be
big
fluff
of
cloud
after
we
finishing
ally
followed
them
in
and
there
was
betty
ally
figured
betty
assumed
her
but
totally
american
name
was
easier
than
whatever
she
used
in
russia
but
to
ally
it
just
felt
weird
betty
had
dark
hair
a
broad
smile
that
would
die
and
approximately
thirty
pounds
that
would
have
looked
better
on
misha
they
reminded
her
of
jack
sprat
et
al
honey
there
is
problem
at
your
office
woman
name
jennifer
call
say
she
try
reach
you
at
home
but
you
leave
already
and
you
do
answer
your
cell
phone
shit
i
turned
it
off
knickers
goes
nuts
if
it
rings
in
the
car
jennifer
was
only
a
couple
of
years
older
than
ally
but
she
been
with
the
firm
back
when
ally
father
arthur
ran
it
and
she
was
the
mother
figure
of
citispace
she
was
also
ally
best
friend
and
had
been
even
before
ally
came
back
to
run
the
firm
ally
felt
like
she
had
known
her
forever
these
days
jen
spent
a
lot
of
effort
trying
to
create
a
social
life
for
ally
that
would
include
eligible
men
she
kept
nagging
her
to
join
some
clubs
anything
just
get
out
there
ally
knew
she
was
right
but
she
was
working
too
hard
to
take
time
out
she
had
the
idea
which
she
was
naive
enough
to
actually
believe
at
a
rational
level
that
sooner
or
later
someone
who
could
replace
steve
would
come
along
yes
she
was
lonely
a
lot
but
until
this
last
deterioration
of
her
heart
she
spent
a
lot
of
evenings
and
weekends
outside
biking
and
hiking
around
town
and
she
knew
plenty
of
people
who
were
interesting
and
kind
she
sometimes
thought
her
problem
was
that
she
liked
people
all
kinds
of
people
as
long
as
they
were
kept
slightly
away
at
a
psychic
distance
maybe
it
was
the
getting
close
part
that
never
seemed
to
work
out
it
had
actually
been
that
way
ever
since
steve
disappeared
she
had
the
premonition
that
if
she
got
too
close
to
somebody
she
was
destined
to
lose
them
now
she
stood
for
a
second
puzzling
she
mentioned
taking
knickers
to
pooch
pros
so
that
how
jen
knew
where
she
be
but
what
could
have
gone
wrong
at
in
the
morning
jennifer
was
usually
in
this
early
but
she
was
finishing
a
rush
job
for
a
marble
bathroom
for
a
couple
on
the
upper
east
side
on
days
when
jennifer
did
get
to
the
office
first
she
have
the
coffee
going
and
an
extra
bagel
for
knickers
on
the
chance
ally
might
bring
her
which
she
often
did
but
to
phone
betty
just
to
tell
her
to
hurry
that
was
odd
should
i
call
now
it
seemed
pointless
she
was
no
more
than
ten
minutes
away
what
else
could
go
wrong
in
ten
minutes
she
sound
very
hurry
betty
declared
ally
took
her
cell
phone
out
of
her
bag
and
switched
it
on
the
office
rang
only
once
and
then
jennifer
was
there
ally
you
not
going
to
believe
who
called
here
ten
minutes
ago
asking
for
you
winston
bartlett
my
god
it
like
donald
trump
called
well
actually
it
was
some
male
secretary
or
something
he
said
he
was
calling
to
confirm
your
ten
appointment
at
an
address
on
gramercy
park
east
what
that
about
jesus
ally
where
are
you
i
do
know
what
you
up
to
but
this
could
be
big
he
owns
entire
buildings
for
chrissake
did
you
say
i
was
coming
i
did
know
what
to
say
he
left
a
number
to
call
if
you
ca
make
it
otherwise
he
assume
you
be
there
it
only
two
hours
from
now
all
right
jen
let
put
together
a
of
our
biggest
jobs
lead
with
that
gut
rehab
we
did
on
the
building
down
by
the
south
street
seaport
and
put
in
those
two
lofts
we
did
on
that
conversion
in
tribeca
the
ones
with
the
slate
bathrooms
and
the
countertops
in
the
kitchen
i
already
started
do
you
know
specifically
what
he
has
in
mind
she
paused
how
did
he
find
out
about
us
anyway
my
creepy
kid
brother
works
for
him
she
sighed
it
a
long
story
be
there
in
a
couple
of
minutes
she
clicked
off
the
phone
betty
thanks
a
lot
i
got
ta
run
she
turned
and
gave
knickers
a
last
rumple
of
the
ears
be
good
baby
i
pick
you
up
by
six
at
the
latest
what
wrong
misha
was
concerned
twisting
a
white
towel
he
was
holding
big
problem
nothing
wrong
actually
something
probably
is
wrong
i
just
know
what
it
is
yet
she
headed
out
the
door
the
design
firm
her
father
had
started
and
she
kept
going
now
with
some
architecture
thrown
in
was
on
the
ground
floor
of
an
old
industrial
loft
building
whose
upper
floors
had
been
converted
into
rental
apartments
in
the
early
the
owner
was
an
named
oskar
jacobi
who
had
turned
zen
master
after
a
fashion
and
had
a
studio
upstairs
on
the
second
floor
he
had
drifted
from
wrestling
into
karate
during
his
thirties
and
thence
into
the
life
of
the
mind
or
rather
the
life
of
in
his
late
forties
now
he
taught
meditation
as
well
as
karate
and
insisted
they
be
learned
in
that
order
he
served
as
his
own
superintendent
mopping
the
halls
and
setting
out
the
garbage
on
pickup
days
the
ground
floor
was
zoned
commercial
and
citispace
had
a
lease
for
all
of
it
which
meant
she
had
tons
of
space
oskar
had
given
dad
arthur
a
lease
which
was
now
a
fraction
of
the
going
rate
they
both
knew
that
and
she
more
than
once
offered
to
renegotiate
or
move
but
he
said
he
did
need
any
more
income
and
besides
he
liked
having
her
as
a
tenant
because
she
reminded
him
of
her
father
it
was
a
generosity
perfectly
in
keeping
with
his
philosophy
that
excess
money
corrupted
the
spirit
she
done
the
place
as
a
sort
of
spanish
desert
flower
with
orange
tile
floors
and
all
the
natural
materials
she
could
cram
in
a
lot
of
her
clients
wanted
the
industrial
look
in
their
lofts
which
was
fine
by
her
but
she
found
it
too
cold
for
a
daily
working
environment
the
front
was
unassuming
with
small
lettering
on
the
window
citispace
was
not
a
business
and
she
had
no
metal
gates
over
the
windows
what
to
protect
when
she
marched
through
the
door
everybody
looked
up
from
their
coffee
and
computers
and
jennifer
led
the
applause
winston
bartlett
had
they
finally
made
the
this
could
be
the
start
of
something
big
chapter
april
ally
stepped
out
of
the
cab
holding
the
large
portfolio
and
checked
the
number
on
the
card
against
the
bronze
plaque
above
the
door
winston
bartlett
lived
like
a
robber
baron
the
building
had
five
stories
and
was
adorned
with
italian
marble
window
lintels
that
glowed
like
already
she
liked
his
sense
of
style
bartlett
was
new
money
but
this
place
had
the
solemn
dignity
of
old
money
the
front
door
was
eight
feet
tall
and
solid
mahogany
the
odd
thing
was
there
were
two
doorbells
one
read
bartlett
and
the
other
read
bartlett
that
was
when
she
remembered
she
had
read
somewhere
that
he
had
a
wife
named
eileen
but
why
did
she
have
a
separate
doorbell
winston
bartlett
had
a
tabloid
reputation
as
a
womanizer
perhaps
they
lived
apart
if
so
there
it
was
for
all
the
world
to
see
she
found
herself
examining
the
late
greek
revival
columns
on
either
side
of
the
door
they
were
marble
and
meticulously
cleaned
of
soot
whose
ubiquitous
presence
in
new
york
meant
that
eventually
everything
not
regularly
scrubbed
turned
gray
it
told
her
that
winston
bartlett
liked
things
to
be
immaculate
and
that
he
was
a
stickler
when
it
came
to
details
she
glanced
up
and
noticed
that
she
was
being
observed
by
a
security
camera
she
was
reaching
out
to
push
the
bell
for
bartlett
when
the
door
magically
opened
a
tall
trim
japanese
man
in
a
crisp
black
suit
was
standing
in
the
doorway
but
he
had
a
muscular
build
that
would
be
more
appropriate
for
a
bodyguard
than
a
butler
hello
she
said
i
have
an
appointment
with
yes
he
nodded
appearing
to
know
exactly
who
she
was
he
upstairs
in
the
library
please
she
expected
a
grand
central
staircase
in
the
palladian
design
but
instead
there
were
elevators
off
to
the
left
of
the
entryway
but
even
without
an
obvious
staircase
the
ground
floor
and
its
ceiling
were
palatial
in
every
sense
of
the
term
the
marble
floors
were
covered
with
antique
and
expensive
persian
rugs
and
the
light
tan
wallpaper
was
flecked
with
gold
leaf
giving
the
feeling
it
could
have
been
meticulously
stripped
from
some
palazzo
in
venice
the
lighting
fixtures
were
a
row
of
chandeliers
down
the
middle
of
the
vast
room
and
at
the
back
was
a
dining
table
that
appeared
to
be
large
enough
to
seat
thirty
dinner
guests
the
architecture
was
a
showpiece
for
the
extravagant
taste
of
some
victorian
enemy
of
the
people
but
what
really
set
it
apart
was
that
the
walls
were
lined
with
exquisitely
severe
antique
swords
and
armor
from
japan
in
a
way
the
room
felt
like
the
foyer
of
a
boutique
museum
an
adjunct
of
the
asia
society
the
japanese
man
directed
her
to
one
of
the
elevators
and
then
got
in
with
her
she
still
could
decide
whether
he
was
a
butler
or
a
bodyguard
he
had
the
polished
demeanor
of
the
first
but
the
strapping
body
and
deft
movements
of
the
latter
maybe
he
was
both
in
any
case
he
looked
like
he
would
be
quite
at
ease
brandishing
one
of
those
long
samurai
swords
the
elevator
had
dark
paneling
and
smelled
of
freshness
partly
fresh
wood
and
partly
fresh
lacquer
it
was
utterly
silent
as
it
glided
up
to
the
third
floor
when
the
door
opened
she
stepped
into
what
appeared
to
be
a
large
except
that
there
was
a
huge
antique
bed
at
the
far
corner
with
its
drapes
drawn
around
the
side
it
was
definitely
something
out
of
another
place
and
time
was
this
bartlett
bedroom
the
space
was
magisterial
in
the
other
corner
was
a
wide
mahogany
desk
covered
with
phones
and
papers
and
two
computers
from
his
photos
she
recognized
the
man
rising
to
greet
her
as
winston
bartlett
seeing
him
in
the
flesh
she
first
noticed
that
there
was
something
in
his
eyes
that
in
another
man
might
be
called
ruthless
but
in
him
it
merely
came
off
as
determined
they
were
eyes
that
were
accustomed
to
getting
what
they
wanted
be
it
a
company
a
building
a
woman
fine
ken
and
please
have
them
hold
my
calls
bartlett
said
nodding
to
the
japanese
man
who
tipped
his
head
in
acknowledgment
and
disappeared
back
into
the
elevator
then
he
turned
to
her
and
extended
his
hand
hampton
i
appreciate
your
making
time
for
me
possibly
your
newest
fan
after
grant
told
me
about
you
i
had
a
couple
of
my
people
do
some
research
you
been
responsible
for
some
very
interesting
even
elegant
interiors
grant
may
have
told
you
i
have
a
big
project
down
the
road
that
you
might
wish
to
bid
on
but
for
now
as
a
way
of
getting
to
know
each
other
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
a
more
modest
undertaking
she
thanked
him
attempting
to
take
it
all
in
she
was
trying
not
to
admit
to
herself
that
winston
bartlett
was
an
attractive
man
in
the
way
that
power
brings
charisma
i
be
happy
to
hear
about
what
you
have
in
mind
i
do
necessarily
take
every
job
that
comes
along
i
always
look
for
challenges
she
listened
to
herself
and
wondered
why
she
was
starting
off
the
meeting
in
such
a
confrontational
manner
probably
she
thought
it
was
because
she
did
want
to
seem
intimidated
doing
interior
design
you
come
across
a
lot
of
wealth
and
power
but
this
was
a
whole
new
level
well
i
guess
i
the
same
way
he
smiled
a
lot
of
the
things
done
over
the
years
have
ended
up
being
a
challenge
and
a
risk
but
now
and
then
something
is
worth
it
he
gestured
toward
a
couch
please
we
have
a
lot
to
talk
about
he
returned
to
the
chair
behind
his
desk
and
turned
off
the
laptop
computer
he
had
been
using
i
brought
a
portfolio
she
began
with
photos
there
also
a
dvd
with
virtual
of
some
of
our
projects
i
not
sure
what
you
have
in
mind
but
this
should
give
you
some
idea
of
the
kind
of
thing
we
i
look
at
it
he
said
setting
the
portfolio
aside
unopened
sure
you
live
up
to
your
reputation
like
i
said
i
have
two
jobs
pending
so
first
let
me
outline
the
smaller
one
this
building
was
built
just
before
the
prior
turn
of
the
century
and
it
was
intended
to
house
a
small
workforce
of
cooks
and
nannies
and
seamstresses
below
stairs
the
rooms
were
lit
with
town
gas
and
coal
was
used
for
heating
and
cooking
then
in
the
twenties
everything
was
gradually
switched
over
to
electricity
and
oil
and
natural
gas
but
very
little
effort
was
made
to
accommodate
the
change
aesthetically
it
was
just
retrofitted
that
typically
how
it
was
done
and
i
have
really
cared
until
now
he
went
on
but
lately
decided
i
want
to
redo
this
place
properly
starting
below
stairs
and
moving
up
it
mainly
the
kitchen
down
there
that
concerns
me
now
i
want
to
remove
all
the
outdated
fixtures
and
go
state
of
the
art
there
nothing
original
there
anymore
just
somebody
idea
of
a
back
in
the
fifties
so
nothing
of
historic
value
will
be
lost
i
do
want
a
restaurant
kitchen
precisely
but
i
want
a
range
with
enough
btu
that
it
could
be
granite
countertops
are
all
the
rage
these
days
he
paused
then
grinned
sheepishly
i
promise
i
wo
start
telling
you
how
to
do
your
job
work
up
some
ideas
without
any
interference
from
me
and
then
we
see
where
we
go
from
there
do
you
have
any
blueprints
of
this
building
the
original
plans
he
smiled
as
though
to
say
you
ask
good
questions
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
filed
downtown
in
a
cranny
of
the
department
of
buildings
and
i
had
an
expediter
i
know
track
them
down
he
paused
hampton
there
is
one
little
matter
i
want
to
clear
with
you
in
advance
i
know
that
the
newspapers
occasionally
print
things
about
me
that
might
be
termed
unsavory
you
came
to
meet
me
here
so
that
tells
me
something
about
your
feelings
toward
me
but
i
have
discovered
that
i
am
a
somewhat
controversial
figure
in
certain
circles
i
just
like
to
know
if
you
think
of
me
as
controversial
she
found
this
unexpected
new
tack
in
the
conversation
puzzling
was
he
trying
to
get
a
rise
out
of
her
i
barely
know
you
bartlett
she
said
and
frankly
the
private
life
of
a
client
is
none
of
my
business
so
that
question
is
entirely
unnecessary
very
well
he
smiled
like
i
said
there
a
much
larger
job
now
in
the
planning
stage
i
have
a
building
on
park
avenue
in
the
seventies
that
i
planning
to
convert
into
a
museum
it
would
be
a
private
undertaking
at
first
but
in
the
long
run
who
knows
the
job
will
require
extensive
alterations
of
the
building
and
i
also
plan
to
have
a
museum
cafe
in
the
lower
level
anyway
there
a
lot
of
work
ahead
and
i
thought
this
would
be
a
good
way
for
us
to
get
acquainted
redoing
the
first
floor
here
would
give
us
both
some
idea
of
whether
we
could
work
together
on
a
larger
project
she
listened
and
found
herself
wondering
what
he
was
really
up
to
this
conversation
felt
like
he
thought
he
needed
to
have
plenty
of
bait
on
the
hook
first
grant
and
then
him
a
tycoon
who
a
perfect
stranger
why
april
bartlett
was
not
finding
himself
entirely
satisfied
with
the
way
things
were
going
as
he
looked
her
over
he
had
a
lot
on
his
mind
this
was
the
woman
who
shared
his
rare
blood
type
and
could
represent
his
last
hope
so
far
she
seemed
smart
and
courageous
given
the
gravity
of
what
he
heard
about
her
heart
condition
from
karl
which
you
never
realize
by
just
looking
at
her
she
had
to
be
courageous
to
continue
on
with
her
kind
of
spirit
but
that
was
not
necessarily
all
to
the
good
she
might
not
be
so
easy
to
manipulate
inevitably
he
found
himself
comparing
her
to
kristen
for
starters
alexa
hampton
seemed
to
have
a
lot
more
assurance
kristy
liked
to
appear
tough
on
camera
but
she
was
riddled
with
an
aspiring
actress
insecurities
which
had
played
a
large
part
in
the
current
tragedy
but
you
could
say
she
brought
that
on
herself
alexa
hampton
was
struggling
with
something
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
and
to
look
at
her
you
never
know
it
that
was
spunk
in
truth
this
was
the
kind
of
woman
he
often
wished
he
married
someone
who
shared
his
own
gusto
for
life
god
had
dealt
her
a
particularly
lousy
hand
and
yet
she
still
had
drive
she
had
more
courage
in
her
little
finger
than
that
monster
upstairs
eileen
and
the
fact
was
she
was
more
appealing
than
kristen
but
do
even
think
about
going
there
coincidentally
he
said
beginning
a
new
tack
there
a
totally
unrelated
matter
i
wanted
to
discuss
with
you
i
understand
grant
has
already
told
you
about
the
clinical
trials
currently
winding
up
at
the
dorian
institute
which
is
part
of
one
of
my
companies
he
told
me
about
your
heart
condition
and
about
your
mother
alzheimer
working
on
a
new
procedure
that
could
be
very
relevant
for
both
of
you
the
clinical
trials
are
scheduled
to
conclude
in
just
a
few
days
from
now
but
i
spoke
with
the
lead
researcher
there
van
de
vliet
and
he
said
there
still
time
to
get
you
into
the
program
yes
grant
came
to
see
me
and
brought
me
a
brochure
your
brother
is
very
concerned
about
you
and
your
mother
and
he
specifically
asked
me
to
inquire
if
you
had
any
questions
about
the
procedure
that
i
might
be
able
to
answer
for
you
he
was
watching
her
carefully
all
the
while
trying
to
keep
his
tone
casual
well
i
think
my
mother
is
interested
quite
frankly
she
does
have
much
to
lose
though
she
may
be
in
denial
about
that
in
my
own
case
i
not
so
sure
i
still
do
know
anything
about
karl
van
de
vliet
she
still
toying
with
the
bait
bartlett
thought
i
ca
yank
the
line
just
yet
but
she
close
she
so
close
truly
the
best
thing
you
could
do
would
be
to
talk
to
him
bartlett
said
getting
up
from
his
desk
and
walking
over
to
the
window
and
pulling
the
curtains
aside
the
light
streamed
in
a
momentarily
blinding
presence
i
got
to
shake
this
up
he
told
himself
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
like
for
you
to
meet
with
karl
before
we
go
any
further
with
this
job
we
need
to
get
you
well
first
and
your
mother
he
had
some
truly
amazing
successes
with
both
alzheimer
and
parkinson
it
just
that
this
is
all
so
experimental
are
there
any
side
effects
new
drugs
or
new
medical
procedures
always
have
side
effects
well
he
thought
now
you
hit
on
it
but
that
part
is
best
left
to
karl
if
you
have
questions
that
all
the
more
reason
to
check
out
the
clinic
he
declared
time
to
close
the
sale
he
came
back
and
sat
down
behind
the
mahogany
desk
i
seen
a
lot
of
medical
innovation
over
the
years
including
a
good
bit
in
my
own
companies
but
there
never
been
anything
that
remotely
compares
to
the
promise
of
stem
cell
technology
and
these
clinical
trials
have
shown
how
many
miracles
are
in
the
realm
of
the
doable
grant
said
van
de
vliet
wanted
to
include
someone
with
my
specific
condition
in
the
let
me
be
frank
with
you
he
looked
across
at
her
and
smiled
you
would
be
a
perfect
fit
but
the
trials
are
going
to
be
over
very
very
soon
so
he
anxious
to
get
started
truthfully
i
thinking
about
taking
mom
out
there
she
said
and
since
we
all
being
so
frank
let
me
say
i
getting
the
impression
that
my
going
out
to
your
clinic
is
really
the
reason
you
wanted
to
see
me
today
it
it
the
second
reason
he
said
the
design
job
is
uppermost
in
my
mind
but
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
having
two
purposes
in
seeing
you
as
someone
once
said
commerce
is
the
mutually
beneficial
exchange
of
worth
was
she
agreeing
to
see
van
de
vliet
playing
the
mother
card
may
have
done
the
trick
well
why
do
we
stick
to
tangible
worth
she
said
let
me
take
a
look
at
the
space
downstairs
but
you
have
to
tell
me
some
more
about
what
you
have
in
mind
i
propose
we
do
it
the
other
way
around
you
go
down
and
look
around
take
measurements
make
sketches
whatever
it
is
you
do
and
then
get
back
to
me
with
some
ideas
that
be
our
starting
point
he
picked
up
a
on
his
desk
and
punched
a
button
ken
could
you
please
come
up
i
like
you
to
show
hampton
the
service
floor
he
clicked
it
off
without
waiting
for
a
reply
i
due
down
at
the
office
when
i
get
there
i
have
them
cut
a
check
for
five
thousand
dollars
as
a
retainer
and
messenger
it
over
to
your
shop
is
this
going
to
work
he
wondered
maybe
i
should
be
pushing
harder
he
examined
alexa
hampton
one
last
time
as
he
rose
to
leave
yes
a
rare
woman
would
it
be
ironic
if
karl
actually
could
do
something
for
her
heart
april
as
ally
watched
winston
bartlett
sweep
from
the
room
she
was
still
trying
to
take
measure
of
the
man
what
troubled
her
was
why
grant
and
bartlett
were
both
so
anxious
to
get
her
and
her
mother
out
to
the
clinic
but
give
bartlett
his
due
he
could
charm
the
birds
off
the
trees
she
looked
around
the
room
wondering
what
the
old
kitchen
and
staff
quarters
would
be
like
certainly
not
like
this
the
had
a
rich
feeling
with
a
beautifully
molded
plaster
ceiling
a
virtual
of
fruits
and
birds
and
clouds
all
meticulously
painted
it
was
the
sistine
chapel
but
had
some
of
that
feeling
the
paneling
and
wainscot
were
burnished
mahogany
and
the
floor
was
a
mix
of
hardwoods
worked
into
an
isometric
design
she
decided
it
was
probably
the
most
luxurious
private
residence
she
had
ever
seen
citispace
was
mainly
known
for
its
creative
handling
of
lofts
in
the
abandoned
commercial
buildings
of
soho
and
tribeca
these
old
mansions
of
the
moguls
were
an
entirely
different
world
it
was
intimidating
but
she
was
sure
she
could
do
something
below
stairs
that
would
retain
the
period
flavor
of
the
building
while
creating
the
kind
of
semiprofessional
space
he
said
he
wanted
still
it
was
different
from
anything
else
citispace
had
ever
done
so
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
whether
or
not
she
could
pull
it
off
again
that
question
why
on
earth
would
he
hand
her
this
plum
job
and
where
was
his
wife
although
he
liked
to
be
photographed
with
blond
starlets
the
tabloids
always
reminded
you
that
he
had
a
wife
someplace
the
two
doorbells
were
a
that
that
someplace
was
here
best
guess
she
probably
had
the
top
floors
my
god
was
madame
bartlett
going
to
get
involved
in
the
renovation
a
lot
of
women
with
superrich
husbands
and
too
much
time
on
their
hands
come
to
assume
that
that
happenstance
creates
in
them
a
natural
gift
for
interior
design
big
problem
but
whatever
happened
this
could
be
a
sweetheart
job
and
maybe
get
a
crack
at
that
museum
he
talked
about
that
was
the
kind
of
thing
an
designer
dreamed
about
she
looked
up
to
see
the
japanese
man
bartlett
had
called
him
ken
stepping
into
the
room
he
was
all
business
april
bartlett
was
on
the
phone
to
van
de
vliet
the
moment
he
stepped
into
his
limo
to
head
downtown
she
said
she
thinking
about
bringing
her
mother
out
to
the
institute
karl
i
believe
she
ready
to
do
it
before
she
changes
her
mind
i
want
you
to
talk
to
her
and
schedule
an
appointment
for
tomorrow
morning
if
you
can
i
put
in
a
call
to
her
office
karl
she
not
there
now
try
her
cell
grant
has
the
number
we
need
to
get
moving
on
this
i
done
about
all
i
can
at
the
moment
he
was
watching
the
midmorning
traffic
that
was
clogging
the
avenue
he
always
felt
claustrophobic
in
a
limo
even
a
stretch
the
only
time
he
felt
free
was
when
he
was
in
the
mcdonnell
douglas
chopper
when
he
was
flying
the
chopper
against
all
the
laws
of
civil
aviation
do
you
think
that
a
little
pushy
we
should
seem
too
anxious
believe
me
i
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
ambivalent
patients
all
right
she
should
be
back
at
her
office
sometime
after
lunch
i
wait
awhile
and
put
in
a
call
there
he
paused
when
was
the
last
time
you
saw
beta
one
the
situation
at
park
avenue
i
do
want
to
discuss
it
over
a
cell
karl
this
conversation
was
definitely
a
bad
idea
she
comes
and
goes
i
think
it
getting
worse
i
try
to
get
over
there
late
this
afternoon
and
look
in
on
her
van
de
vliet
said
i
want
to
see
her
every
day
karl
we
ca
give
up
hope
never
give
up
hope
he
clicked
off
the
phone
and
thought
about
his
crapshoot
with
god
kristen
had
wanted
to
play
to
experiment
with
the
beta
but
nobody
made
her
undergo
the
procedure
she
should
never
his
cell
phone
rang
yeah
bartlett
came
a
female
voice
with
a
brooklyn
accent
it
bernd
allen
calling
put
him
on
shit
bartlett
thought
this
is
news
i
do
want
to
hear
bernd
was
a
brit
who
was
in
charge
of
accounting
for
bartlett
medical
devices
he
was
and
not
a
risk
taker
and
he
was
always
worried
about
something
that
was
his
job
these
days
he
had
plenty
to
be
worried
about
he
had
been
running
a
weekly
projection
of
the
cash
flow
at
bmd
and
the
drawdown
was
now
getting
perilous
the
flagship
product
of
bartlett
medical
devices
had
been
the
balloons
used
in
heart
angioplasty
that
inflate
and
expand
clogged
arteries
they
were
marketed
together
with
stents
miniature
metal
mesh
supports
that
keep
coronary
arteries
open
after
angioplasty
the
problem
was
that
in
percent
of
the
cases
the
stents
manufactured
by
bmd
caused
scar
tissue
to
form
a
process
called
restenosis
and
block
an
artery
requiring
a
repeat
of
angioplasty
or
even
a
bypass
operation
other
manufacturers
numbers
were
not
any
better
but
a
few
months
back
out
of
the
blue
hemotronics
a
competing
company
near
boston
had
introduced
stents
coated
with
drugs
that
prevented
scarring
bmd
piece
of
the
billion
angioplasty
market
had
plummeted
from
percent
to
percent
and
was
still
dropping
like
a
stone
add
to
that
two
titanium
joint
replacements
for
arthritis
patients
that
they
pinned
their
future
on
along
with
millions
in
cash
still
had
at
least
two
years
of
human
trials
left
before
they
could
hope
for
fda
approval
long
story
short
bmd
was
in
a
mature
product
cycle
with
its
most
lucrative
hospital
hardware
with
nothing
major
in
the
pipeline
for
at
least
two
years
they
had
bet
the
ranch
on
the
stem
cell
research
at
gerex
i
just
got
last
week
numbers
back
from
the
eyeshade
chaps
downstairs
as
you
asked
i
had
them
refine
all
the
assumptions
remember
the
union
contract
there
going
to
be
a
three
percent
wage
increase
for
all
hourly
personnel
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
we
did
hedge
our
euro
exposure
and
now
it
going
against
us
that
my
own
bloody
fault
and
since
we
do
have
any
pricing
flexibility
in
that
territory
at
the
moment
it
like
a
four
percent
haircut
right
off
the
bottom
line
remember
we
ran
that
in
a
scenario
a
while
back
well
chances
are
we
about
to
see
it
for
real
bartlett
had
been
watching
the
rate
of
cash
burn
and
trying
not
to
let
the
problem
be
evident
the
logical
thing
to
do
start
laying
off
workers
in
the
fabrication
divisions
was
out
of
the
question
if
you
had
a
deal
cooking
you
could
afford
to
look
like
you
were
on
the
ropes
give
me
some
parameters
bartlett
said
you
know
we
already
hit
our
credit
lines
at
chase
about
as
hard
as
we
dare
without
them
calling
for
a
review
so
unless
we
try
to
refinance
some
real
property
say
the
flagship
building
downtown
and
in
this
environment
any
rational
lender
would
put
a
gun
to
our
head
we
got
to
ink
this
deal
with
cambridge
pharmaceuticals
in
two
months
max
right
now
we
living
on
borrowed
money
and
it
about
to
be
borrowed
time
too
you
do
know
the
half
of
it
bartlett
thought
i
already
living
on
borrowed
time
what
more
if
word
of
the
beta
gets
out
we
can
kiss
the
buyout
the
adverse
publicity
and
legal
problems
nobody
going
to
buy
into
that
kind
of
liability
not
cambridge
not
anybody
bernd
does
know
about
it
yet
if
he
did
then
he
really
be
worried
bernd
take
a
deep
breath
we
on
schedule
and
we
got
to
make
sure
we
stay
that
way
get
hold
of
grant
and
tell
him
i
want
him
to
the
regulatory
situation
for
the
cambridge
deal
i
know
he
already
has
but
i
want
a
memo
from
our
attorneys
by
noon
tomorrow
if
there
are
going
to
be
any
roadblocks
cropping
up
we
need
to
know
about
them
now
we
ca
afford
to
be
blindsided
he
clicked
off
the
phone
and
tried
to
think
in
the
confines
of
a
limousine
it
was
hard
what
it
all
for
unknown
to
the
world
but
unfortunately
known
to
his
wife
eileen
winston
bartlett
had
a
natural
son
and
that
son
now
in
his
own
career
despised
bartlett
it
was
one
of
many
sorrows
he
had
long
since
learned
to
bear
all
the
same
he
increasingly
regretted
that
he
had
made
such
a
botch
of
their
relationship
the
man
who
was
his
natural
son
had
done
very
well
for
himself
professionally
had
plenty
of
drive
and
in
fact
bartlett
believed
he
himself
deserved
some
of
the
credit
for
that
what
he
had
done
was
let
the
boy
fend
for
himself
which
was
exactly
how
bartlett
was
raised
make
it
with
your
own
two
hands
how
else
are
you
supposed
to
develop
any
character
and
it
had
worked
the
pity
was
he
now
hated
winston
bartlett
guts
but
bartlett
had
begun
thinking
more
and
more
about
a
legacy
what
if
he
could
make
peace
with
that
son
and
bring
him
into
the
business
right
now
the
closest
thing
he
had
to
a
son
was
grant
hampton
and
hampton
was
a
little
too
slick
and
expedient
bartlett
knew
a
standard
hustler
when
he
saw
one
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
he
was
convincing
himself
to
make
his
natural
son
his
sole
heir
assuming
there
was
anything
left
to
pass
on
april
bartlett
asked
me
to
give
you
this
kenji
noda
said
handing
her
a
large
manila
envelope
as
they
stepped
off
the
elevator
it
a
copy
of
the
original
plans
and
also
there
a
blueprint
for
the
current
layout
along
with
measurements
she
took
it
looking
him
over
again
as
she
did
there
was
something
very
fluid
about
his
motions
he
could
have
been
a
dancer
there
was
a
softness
about
him
and
yet
you
got
an
unmistakable
sense
of
inner
strength
she
suspected
he
had
something
to
do
with
incredible
collection
of
japanese
he
looked
like
he
could
have
a
connoisseur
eye
she
walked
into
the
service
space
and
looked
around
the
back
part
which
was
the
kitchen
had
stone
walls
that
had
been
whitewashed
there
also
were
two
massive
fireplaces
which
she
assumed
had
once
housed
stoves
large
covered
gas
ranges
were
there
now
but
the
space
was
fabulous
massive
columns
went
down
the
center
and
a
partition
separated
the
front
half
of
the
space
from
the
back
the
front
traditionally
would
have
been
the
nursery
and
sewing
room
in
short
the
maids
working
quarters
she
turned
to
the
man
bartlett
had
called
ken
does
bartlett
have
a
cook
she
asked
this
kitchen
does
look
used
no
he
said
actually
he
almost
never
dines
here
and
bartlett
has
her
meals
delivered
from
various
restaurants
though
she
does
go
out
sometimes
as
well
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
heard
any
mention
of
eileen
bartlett
she
resides
on
the
top
two
floors
he
went
on
she
has
her
own
dining
room
up
there
where
she
takes
her
meals
along
with
an
efficiency
kitchen
so
the
bartletts
did
live
completely
separate
lives
that
explained
a
lot
okay
she
said
i
want
to
look
around
and
get
a
feeling
for
the
space
and
start
putting
together
some
ideas
she
was
starting
to
focus
on
the
job
the
ceiling
was
lower
than
upstairs
but
still
the
space
had
enormous
possibilities
off
the
top
i
probably
suggest
we
open
this
out
remove
that
dividing
wall
and
make
a
great
room
with
the
right
kind
of
kitchen
this
could
be
a
marvelous
contemporary
space
for
semiformal
dining
and
entertaining
assuming
she
thought
winston
bartlett
actually
wanted
a
renovated
space
to
entertain
she
still
had
the
nagging
suspicion
that
he
just
wanted
her
i
use
materials
that
have
a
really
warm
tone
mix
different
materials
for
the
different
parts
of
the
kitchen
and
the
room
she
thought
the
cabinets
could
be
mahogany
to
echo
the
extensive
use
of
that
wood
upstairs
and
the
walls
around
the
stove
area
and
the
fireplaces
could
be
an
colored
slate
and
that
look
could
be
accented
with
polished
granite
countertops
in
a
slightly
darker
hue
there
would
need
to
be
a
stove
probably
a
big
viking
with
a
slate
backsplash
all
around
a
couple
of
zero
refrigerators
and
a
large
bosch
dishwasher
could
be
spaced
along
in
the
slate
and
granite
and
if
bartlett
wanted
it
there
could
be
a
place
for
a
wine
cellar
design
there
also
would
need
to
be
a
large
stone
island
say
a
brandy
craig
with
a
couple
of
sinks
and
depending
on
what
he
wanted
maybe
another
high
btu
stovetop
there
she
turned
to
ken
if
you
have
something
else
to
do
i
just
need
to
walk
around
and
live
in
this
space
a
little
then
i
want
to
make
some
notes
on
the
plans
possibly
take
a
few
photos
take
your
time
he
said
i
be
upstairs
he
disappeared
into
the
elevator
with
his
curious
catlike
gait
and
was
gone
in
an
instant
as
she
looked
around
she
realized
the
thing
that
was
missing
was
light
wait
a
minute
she
thought
there
must
be
a
garden
at
the
rear
of
this
building
there
are
windows
in
the
front
so
why
are
there
any
at
the
back
she
turned
to
examine
the
back
wall
it
was
in
fact
clearly
of
recent
origin
and
there
was
a
door
at
one
side
she
walked
over
to
the
door
which
was
locked
with
a
thumb
latch
and
opened
it
and
sure
enough
behind
the
building
was
an
unkempt
space
the
width
of
the
building
that
ran
back
for
a
good
thirty
or
feet
when
she
stepped
out
into
the
sunshine
and
looked
at
the
back
of
the
building
she
realized
there
also
was
a
row
of
windows
facing
the
garden
that
had
been
bricked
shut
what
a
travesty
the
whole
design
would
depend
on
whether
those
windows
could
be
reopened
but
if
bartlett
would
allow
it
then
there
were
tremendous
possibilities
with
all
this
light
you
could
who
the
hell
are
you
came
a
raspy
oversmoked
voice
from
behind
her
are
you
his
new
tart
we
agreed
he
would
never
bring
his
whores
here
ally
turned
to
see
a
tall
willowy
woman
who
appeared
to
be
in
her
she
had
blond
hair
clearly
out
of
a
bottle
and
a
layer
of
pancake
makeup
that
looked
as
though
it
had
been
applied
by
a
mortician
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
introduced
myself
she
squeezed
past
the
woman
in
the
doorway
and
walked
over
to
the
counter
where
she
had
left
her
bag
she
extracted
a
business
card
and
presented
it
the
woman
squinted
at
it
obviously
having
trouble
making
out
the
print
i
work
with
the
design
firm
citispace
and
i
was
asked
by
bartlett
to
give
him
an
estimate
for
some
renovations
she
had
quickly
acquired
the
sense
that
the
less
said
to
this
woman
the
better
i
his
wife
and
i
still
do
know
who
the
hell
you
are
she
squinted
at
ally
a
moment
then
glanced
back
at
the
card
what
is
citispace
it
an
firm
what
are
you
then
some
kind
of
decorator
she
grasped
the
door
to
steady
herself
and
ally
suddenly
wondered
if
she
was
slightly
tipsy
actually
what
we
do
is
probably
closer
to
architecture
ally
was
collecting
her
belongings
hoping
to
get
out
before
eileen
bartlett
decided
to
do
something
crazy
this
is
the
first
i
heard
about
all
this
she
turned
and
slammed
the
rear
door
mind
if
i
ask
you
a
question
ally
said
do
you
have
any
idea
why
those
back
windows
were
bricked
over
it
for
security
she
said
no
one
is
ever
down
here
that
obvious
ally
thought
which
is
why
this
job
is
so
odd
this
space
clearly
is
being
used
now
and
the
social
dynamic
here
bode
well
for
a
lot
of
cozy
entertaining
and
dinner
parties
in
the
foreseeable
future
so
why
is
he
spending
money
to
renovate
and
in
this
big
hurry
and
he
just
happened
to
pick
me
to
do
this
as
an
audition
for
designing
an
entire
museum
no
this
whole
thing
definitely
does
not
compute
but
of
course
it
does
the
job
is
a
blatant
bribe
to
butter
me
up
for
something
look
miss
i
want
you
to
leave
i
do
appreciate
strange
women
walking
around
unescorted
in
my
house
i
going
right
now
perhaps
you
should
speak
to
bartlett
and
decide
together
what
you
want
to
do
about
this
space
i
tell
you
right
now
what
i
want
to
do
nothing
for
all
i
know
he
fixing
this
up
so
he
can
move
in
some
tart
we
lived
here
for
years
and
he
never
done
anything
down
here
so
why
is
that
tightfisted
sob
suddenly
deciding
to
renovate
that
would
be
an
excellent
question
to
ask
him
you
screwing
him
are
you
she
demanded
wrinkled
brow
furrowed
and
dim
eyes
seething
like
that
other
little
whore
of
his
that
why
he
hired
you
well
let
me
tell
you
something
i
outlive
you
both
without
another
word
she
turned
and
got
into
the
elevator
chapter
april
hey
how
did
it
go
jennifer
asked
the
minute
ally
came
in
the
door
she
was
sure
she
knew
the
answer
to
that
initially
the
job
looked
like
a
lot
of
fun
but
now
she
felt
the
interpersonal
dynamics
of
working
in
bartlett
home
were
already
a
problem
even
before
she
started
also
maybe
it
was
just
paranoia
but
as
she
took
the
cab
downtown
from
the
mansion
on
gramercy
park
she
got
the
impression
that
somebody
was
following
her
in
a
black
suv
and
the
stress
of
that
brought
on
a
tightness
in
her
chest
but
as
she
neared
their
office
in
soho
the
vehicle
abruptly
veered
east
she
had
a
nitro
tab
at
the
ready
but
she
did
have
to
pop
it
there
good
news
and
bad
news
the
good
news
is
he
practically
handing
us
a
sweetheart
of
a
job
and
dangling
another
designing
a
whole
museum
in
our
face
the
bad
news
is
i
do
know
why
he
suddenly
thinks
we
so
terrific
i
mean
you
and
i
know
that
but
how
did
he
figure
it
out
jennifer
looked
puzzled
you
mean
he
oh
did
i
mention
that
his
crazy
wife
showed
up
after
he
left
and
essentially
accused
me
of
being
a
hooker
i
suppose
that
comes
under
the
heading
of
bad
news
great
does
that
mean
she
going
to
start
whatever
we
do
the
communication
channels
between
bartlett
and
bartlett
do
appear
to
be
all
that
great
they
live
on
different
floors
in
his
place
which
really
is
a
huge
old
mansion
on
gramercy
park
by
the
way
and
the
job
would
be
in
his
part
the
lower
level
she
explained
the
bartletts
living
arrangements
he
wants
to
redo
the
floor
it
was
originally
the
servants
quarters
like
upstairs
downstairs
so
he
upstairs
and
she
way
upstairs
and
let
hope
she
stays
there
ally
fetched
herself
a
cup
of
coffee
checked
in
with
everybody
to
see
how
they
were
doing
and
then
settled
herself
at
her
computer
she
had
the
latest
program
in
design
cad
and
she
wanted
to
program
in
the
dimensions
and
layout
of
the
space
and
since
she
had
a
copy
of
the
blueprints
the
first
thing
she
would
do
would
be
to
run
them
through
her
flatbed
scanner
and
incorporate
them
into
the
program
she
did
get
a
chance
to
take
any
digital
photos
with
snazzy
and
expensive
new
nikon
but
if
the
job
went
forward
be
plenty
of
time
later
everybody
computers
were
connected
to
the
net
via
a
broadband
dsl
hookup
and
they
were
never
turned
off
because
of
that
the
computers
were
vulnerable
to
being
hacked
so
jen
had
installed
a
firewall
program
to
keep
out
snoops
she
sat
down
and
stared
at
the
screen
saver
which
was
an
series
of
tropical
beaches
at
sunset
she
sipped
at
her
coffee
this
was
the
one
cup
she
allowed
herself
each
day
always
saved
for
the
moment
when
she
felt
she
needed
to
be
most
alert
and
reached
to
turn
on
the
scanner
the
tightness
in
her
chest
that
she
had
momentarily
experienced
in
the
cab
had
completely
disappeared
and
she
felt
perfectly
normal
what
was
she
going
to
do
about
her
mother
and
the
clinic
in
new
jersey
nina
certainly
appeared
to
want
to
go
and
with
the
inevitability
of
what
lay
in
store
for
someone
with
alzheimer
taking
her
out
there
was
surely
worth
doing
but
as
for
her
own
heart
she
so
sure
she
thought
the
reward
was
worth
the
risk
but
she
decided
to
hold
off
on
a
decision
till
she
could
have
a
firsthand
look
at
the
institute
she
took
another
sip
of
coffee
and
then
tapped
the
keyboard
when
she
did
that
the
screen
would
normally
bring
up
the
desktop
but
not
this
time
a
file
was
open
and
she
was
certain
she
had
left
it
open
what
this
jen
could
you
come
here
a
minute
there
something
funny
the
first
page
of
the
file
that
had
been
pulled
up
and
opened
was
an
id
photo
of
herself
this
is
what
was
running
has
somebody
been
fooling
around
with
this
computer
jennifer
looked
puzzled
when
she
saw
it
not
that
i
know
of
then
how
did
this
get
she
just
sat
staring
i
did
open
this
file
does
this
thing
have
a
mind
of
its
own
about
eight
years
ago
kate
gillis
at
manhattan
properties
with
whom
ally
had
an
occasional
drink
told
her
she
scanned
all
her
vital
personal
documents
into
her
computer
at
home
she
said
it
was
an
easy
way
to
make
a
safety
backup
seemed
like
a
good
idea
so
ally
had
stored
a
copy
of
her
birth
certificate
her
driver
license
all
her
credit
cards
her
passport
a
set
of
medical
records
even
the
mortgage
on
her
apartment
even
scanned
in
an
id
photo
just
for
the
heck
of
it
she
also
suggested
to
grant
that
he
do
the
same
brilliant
right
well
maybe
not
the
reason
was
she
routinely
made
an
updated
copy
on
a
zip
disk
and
then
copied
it
onto
this
computer
here
in
the
office
like
a
second
backup
i
had
everything
ready
for
you
for
your
meeting
with
bartlett
so
nobody
here
has
touched
your
computer
this
morning
jennifer
furrowed
her
brow
could
somebody
have
picked
the
locks
and
come
in
last
night
and
done
this
like
a
prank
or
something
come
on
that
totally
she
was
trying
to
imagine
how
somebody
could
have
gotten
in
and
out
and
left
no
trace
impossible
this
must
just
be
something
stupid
i
did
when
i
came
down
yesterday
after
seeing
mom
i
do
remember
it
but
i
guess
i
was
pretty
tired
i
never
seen
you
that
tired
jen
right
she
thought
i
was
on
the
city
web
site
checking
the
department
of
buildings
housing
code
but
i
certainly
did
pull
up
my
personal
data
computers
do
strange
things
but
to
open
a
data
file
for
no
reason
that
would
require
a
higher
intelligence
right
jen
you
our
resident
computer
expert
we
leave
these
things
hooked
up
all
the
time
i
know
we
have
a
firewall
but
what
are
the
chances
that
somebody
could
defeat
it
somehow
and
hack
into
our
computers
jennifer
was
a
software
whiz
and
she
had
all
the
designs
for
all
the
clients
on
their
cad
system
which
they
used
to
create
a
reality
space
and
allow
clients
to
walk
through
well
that
entirely
possible
our
firewall
software
is
over
a
year
old
let
me
take
a
look
maybe
i
can
what
happened
if
somebody
went
through
pulling
up
files
i
might
be
able
to
figure
it
out
ally
relinquished
her
chair
and
stood
staring
as
jennifer
started
checking
the
firewall
it
was
scary
to
think
that
some
stranger
could
know
everything
about
you
but
on
the
other
hand
what
difference
could
it
make
she
had
nothing
to
hide
still
it
was
creepy
her
social
security
and
credit
card
information
was
in
that
file
could
that
be
shit
ally
you
not
going
to
believe
this
whoever
did
this
was
damned
good
we
been
seriously
hacked
how
do
you
know
she
bent
over
to
look
our
firewall
software
has
been
disabled
in
fact
the
actual
program
was
uninstalled
jesus
that
cool
i
think
we
better
shut
down
everybody
internet
connection
right
this
minute
till
we
can
get
some
new
software
that
incredible
you
mean
somebody
honey
hackers
have
gotten
into
microsoft
own
site
even
the
pentagon
so
i
heard
anything
is
possible
this
is
not
good
what
are
you
thinking
jen
was
still
staring
at
the
screen
and
tapping
at
the
keyboard
i
thinking
what
a
jerk
i
was
i
keep
all
my
personal
information
in
that
file
like
a
safety
backup
in
case
my
apartment
burned
down
or
something
scanned
it
in
my
passport
driver
license
credit
cards
medical
records
everything
jennifer
looked
puzzled
you
can
just
cancel
the
credit
cards
as
for
the
rest
of
the
stuff
what
could
anybody
possibly
want
with
it
i
do
know
jen
i
do
even
know
if
we
were
hacked
by
somebody
who
wants
to
find
out
about
me
or
just
look
at
our
designs
she
was
reflecting
that
when
somebody
goes
through
your
files
they
want
the
information
for
a
purpose
and
that
purpose
could
be
positive
for
you
or
they
would
have
started
their
undertaking
with
a
surreptitious
act
well
i
going
to
check
around
and
download
a
new
firewall
program
right
now
shit
i
do
need
this
i
got
enough
on
my
mind
already
mom
wants
to
go
out
to
a
clinic
in
the
wilds
of
northern
new
jersey
and
see
a
doctor
there
and
the
whole
thing
makes
me
nervous
oh
jesus
is
the
place
called
the
dorian
institute
by
any
chance
how
did
i
such
a
scatterbrain
i
took
a
message
for
you
while
you
were
gone
from
a
van
de
something
i
think
that
the
name
of
the
place
with
he
wants
you
to
call
him
back
as
soon
as
possible
april
would
she
call
back
karl
van
de
vliet
had
to
believe
she
would
but
nothing
in
this
world
was
sure
on
the
screen
of
his
office
ibm
he
was
scrolling
the
medical
file
that
he
downloaded
earlier
that
morning
how
grant
hampton
got
his
hands
on
it
he
did
know
and
did
want
to
know
yes
alexa
hampton
would
be
perfect
she
had
aortic
valve
stenosis
well
along
the
same
condition
that
had
precipitated
the
coronary
destruction
that
took
camille
from
him
it
was
the
great
tragedy
of
his
life
he
studied
the
charts
carefully
trying
to
assure
himself
he
was
making
the
right
choice
what
if
the
stem
cell
procedure
on
her
heart
work
to
fail
would
mean
he
could
have
saved
camille
after
all
that
was
actually
the
main
reason
he
kept
putting
it
off
he
did
want
to
know
if
he
could
have
rescued
her
but
alexa
hampton
was
the
obvious
candidate
her
clinical
condition
had
deteriorated
to
the
point
that
at
some
level
you
might
even
say
she
had
nothing
to
lose
by
undergoing
an
experimental
procedure
and
she
was
perfect
in
another
way
as
well
other
than
her
heart
condition
which
she
could
do
nothing
about
she
was
in
excellent
physical
shape
her
last
blood
pressure
was
over
and
her
pulse
was
she
clearly
had
been
exercising
which
had
been
both
good
and
bad
for
her
heart
though
on
balance
probably
a
plus
in
fact
it
was
indicative
of
a
strong
fighting
spirit
which
was
often
the
best
prognosticator
of
all
he
looked
up
to
see
debra
connolly
walking
in
he
had
just
paged
her
she
was
an
who
had
been
his
personal
research
assistant
during
her
grad
school
days
at
stanford
now
she
was
a
full
and
valued
member
of
the
research
team
just
turned
thirty
she
also
was
a
smashing
blonde
with
a
figure
that
would
stop
traffic
even
in
her
white
lab
smock
she
held
van
de
vliet
in
the
reverence
always
bestowed
on
a
brilliant
beloved
mentor
hi
deb
i
wanted
you
to
take
a
look
at
this
he
indicated
the
screen
she
knew
all
about
the
beta
and
what
had
happened
to
kristen
the
syndrome
but
she
did
know
about
the
plan
to
subject
alexa
hampton
to
two
procedures
at
once
one
for
her
aortic
valve
stenosis
and
another
to
develop
antibodies
to
combat
the
looming
side
effects
of
the
beta
in
winston
bartlett
this
is
the
patient
i
was
telling
you
about
i
wanted
you
to
see
this
let
pray
she
signs
on
for
the
trials
because
she
looks
like
she
could
be
perfect
in
a
lot
of
ways
but
if
she
does
call
back
he
told
himself
what
am
i
going
to
do
what
am
i
looking
at
debra
asked
scrolling
the
page
is
this
what
i
think
it
is
it
her
medical
history
how
did
you
get
it
she
turned
back
did
she
send
it
no
deb
and
i
do
think
you
really
want
to
know
somehow
i
think
i
probably
should
she
looked
again
at
the
screen
we
in
this
together
all
i
know
is
i
got
an
from
grant
hampton
and
this
was
an
attachment
she
must
have
been
keeping
it
on
a
computer
somewhere
i
understand
he
her
brother
but
how
he
got
it
i
have
no
idea
he
said
we
not
supposed
to
let
her
know
we
have
it
how
recent
this
final
battery
of
tests
is
less
than
two
weeks
old
he
said
pointing
to
the
date
on
the
corner
of
the
page
then
he
scrolled
take
a
look
at
her
ct
scan
see
that
degenerative
calcification
there
now
look
at
the
same
test
last
year
he
scrolled
past
a
number
of
pages
see
he
tapped
the
screen
then
scrolled
back
to
the
first
image
over
the
past
year
there
been
a
significant
buildup
she
order
for
the
clinical
trials
and
there
was
another
reason
he
wanted
her
which
he
was
reluctant
to
admit
to
himself
there
was
a
photo
of
alexa
hampton
in
her
medical
files
and
something
about
her
reminded
him
of
camille
her
eyes
had
a
lot
of
spirit
they
made
you
want
to
root
for
her
it
was
nothing
short
of
ironic
that
this
woman
had
the
exact
same
medical
condition
that
took
the
life
of
camille
who
had
been
at
his
side
during
the
early
stages
of
the
research
that
now
might
provide
a
cure
but
for
camille
it
had
come
too
late
it
was
more
than
ironic
it
was
heartbreaking
now
though
to
save
alexa
hampton
would
be
a
kind
of
circular
recompense
he
took
a
last
look
then
closed
the
file
does
she
want
to
be
in
the
clinical
trials
there
not
much
time
left
we
have
to
get
her
i
just
left
a
message
at
her
office
he
said
revolving
around
in
his
chair
grant
has
talked
to
her
and
so
has
this
very
morning
she
aware
that
time
is
of
the
essence
but
there
no
guarantee
she
do
it
he
glanced
at
his
mute
phone
if
she
did
call
back
today
he
had
a
feeling
that
winston
bartlett
might
just
have
her
seized
and
brought
to
the
institute
by
force
i
see
that
her
blood
type
is
ab
debra
said
extremely
rare
funny
she
should
notice
he
thought
is
she
going
to
put
it
together
that
the
same
as
bartlett
blood
type
she
continued
interesting
coincidence
huh
right
you
already
fond
of
her
are
you
deb
asked
finally
he
detected
the
usual
tinge
of
rivalry
seeping
into
her
voice
without
even
meeting
her
dear
god
he
thought
do
start
that
it
the
same
with
every
attractive
female
patient
under
the
age
of
fifty
i
do
have
time
for
games
now
the
truth
was
karl
van
de
vliet
was
turned
on
by
debra
connolly
what
primate
would
be
but
she
was
half
his
age
and
to
act
on
that
attraction
would
be
to
guarantee
trouble
he
had
enough
to
worry
about
without
a
lab
romance
besides
he
was
still
thinking
about
camille
they
had
the
kind
of
love
debra
would
never
understand
however
she
did
sufficiently
understand
the
problems
with
the
beta
procedure
and
the
syndrome
so
he
had
to
flirt
back
she
had
to
be
kept
on
the
reservation
feign
an
interest
but
not
enough
for
it
to
go
anywhere
deb
she
just
an
ideal
fit
for
the
study
that
all
nothing
more
the
stem
cell
procedure
for
her
stenosis
should
go
forward
with
only
minimal
risk
there
was
every
reason
to
hope
he
could
rejuvenate
the
tissue
in
alexa
left
ventricle
it
was
merely
an
extrapolation
of
the
kind
of
heart
procedure
that
had
worked
such
a
wonder
for
emma
rosen
the
real
challenge
was
simultaneously
attempting
the
related
procedure
the
trick
was
to
stimulate
the
development
of
antibodies
through
a
moderate
dosage
of
the
special
beta
enzyme
tempering
it
enough
that
it
did
go
critical
and
begin
replicating
uncontrollably
the
way
it
had
in
kristen
and
probably
very
soon
in
not
so
low
as
to
be
inoperative
but
not
so
high
that
it
would
go
out
of
control
the
goldilocks
dosage
not
too
much
not
too
little
the
problem
was
he
was
absolutely
sure
what
that
dosage
was
should
he
tell
alexa
hampton
the
full
story
about
what
he
was
doing
about
the
beta
that
ethical
question
he
had
decided
he
would
leave
to
grant
hampton
bartlett
hustler
of
a
cfo
it
was
his
sister
after
all
presumably
he
tell
her
whatever
she
needed
to
know
to
make
an
informed
decision
let
the
responsibility
be
on
his
head
the
phone
on
his
desk
finally
rang
chapter
april
stone
aimes
was
floating
through
cyberspace
through
the
massive
data
pages
of
the
national
institutes
of
health
since
the
gerex
corporation
had
a
complete
clampdown
on
their
results
he
was
attempting
an
end
run
by
going
to
the
source
he
was
hoping
he
could
find
out
whether
or
not
karl
van
de
vliet
experiments
with
stem
cell
technology
were
succeeding
he
needed
that
information
to
finish
his
book
and
he
hoped
that
the
remainder
of
the
advance
could
be
used
to
pay
for
his
daughter
private
school
in
new
york
if
he
got
it
in
time
he
was
dreaming
of
a
life
in
which
she
could
come
back
to
live
with
him
at
least
part
of
the
year
sometimes
particularly
days
like
this
monday
was
his
official
day
off
he
could
avoid
the
fact
he
was
incredibly
lonely
but
first
things
first
he
had
gone
to
the
section
that
described
the
many
and
varied
clinical
trials
the
nih
had
under
way
then
he
used
scrambled
eggs
the
entry
protocol
given
to
him
by
dale
coverton
to
circumvent
security
on
the
site
and
get
him
into
the
nih
data
files
he
was
hoping
to
find
the
names
of
patients
who
had
gone
through
the
gerex
stem
cell
procedure
and
could
be
interviewed
it
really
was
all
that
difficult
or
even
he
told
himself
unethical
to
get
in
this
far
no
big
deal
entry
protocols
were
available
to
any
nih
employee
who
had
the
right
security
grade
now
he
was
poking
through
the
reams
of
proprietary
data
that
the
gerex
corporation
had
submitted
to
initiate
the
clinical
trials
it
was
one
of
the
more
ambitious
studies
he
ever
seen
not
in
numbers
of
patients
necessarily
but
certainly
in
scope
they
were
indeed
running
clinical
trials
of
their
stem
cell
procedure
on
a
variety
of
maladies
there
was
no
placebo
you
either
were
cured
or
you
were
not
jesus
it
was
incredible
they
were
shooting
for
nothing
less
than
the
unified
field
theory
of
medicine
aiming
not
just
to
patch
some
failing
element
of
the
human
body
but
to
regenerate
entire
organs
among
their
stated
objectives
were
building
pancreatic
islets
reconstructing
the
ventricles
of
the
heart
reconstituting
the
damaged
livers
of
individuals
with
advanced
cirrhosis
they
were
also
accepting
patients
with
alzheimer
and
parkinson
christ
he
said
scrolling
past
page
after
page
how
come
suddenly
so
secretive
about
this
if
van
de
vliet
had
achieved
results
in
just
a
fraction
of
those
trials
it
would
herald
the
beginning
of
a
new
age
in
medicine
the
nih
monitor
for
the
gerex
trials
was
cheryl
gates
just
as
dale
had
said
her
photo
was
featured
along
with
the
introductory
description
of
the
trials
he
thought
probably
late
thirties
dark
hair
glasses
she
was
wearing
much
makeup
in
the
photo
probably
to
emphasize
how
serious
she
was
sooner
or
later
he
told
himself
he
had
to
find
a
way
to
meet
her
he
stared
at
his
ibm
aptiva
screen
a
moment
longer
overwhelmed
at
what
he
was
seeing
then
got
up
and
walked
into
the
kitchen
and
made
a
peanut
butter
sandwich
whole
wheat
it
was
a
rehearsal
for
the
possibly
hard
times
to
come
then
he
retrieved
a
brooklyn
lager
from
the
fridge
it
was
his
day
off
and
the
sun
was
over
the
yardarm
he
lived
on
the
fourth
floor
of
a
brownstone
in
yorkville
in
new
york
east
eighties
the
apartment
was
small
but
it
was
rent
stabilized
which
meant
he
was
paying
well
under
market
value
a
month
on
a
place
that
probably
could
go
for
close
to
twice
that
on
the
open
market
he
lucked
into
it
after
he
and
jane
split
even
though
they
were
married
they
bought
a
condo
in
the
west
fifties
and
at
the
breakup
they
switched
the
mortgage
to
her
name
but
the
problem
now
was
how
was
he
going
to
pay
even
this
piddling
rent
not
to
mention
child
support
for
amy
after
he
got
fired
from
the
sentinel
that
day
he
sensed
was
fast
approaching
and
if
it
happened
before
the
book
was
finished
he
was
just
three
months
away
from
going
back
to
freelancing
that
was
how
long
his
nest
egg
would
last
carrying
the
sandwich
and
beer
he
walked
back
to
his
office
a
corner
of
the
cramped
living
room
that
had
an
early
american
desk
and
sat
down
at
the
frayed
chair
in
front
of
his
ibm
so
here
he
was
past
the
first
level
of
security
of
the
nih
site
zeroed
in
on
the
gerex
clinical
trials
somewhere
here
had
to
be
all
the
data
about
the
patients
who
had
been
and
currently
were
participating
he
moved
on
to
the
results
section
and
opened
the
first
page
yes
then
he
looked
more
closely
hello
we
got
a
problem
the
patient
data
he
was
looking
at
had
only
code
numbers
for
names
the
categories
of
trials
also
were
just
numbers
without
a
key
there
was
no
way
to
get
a
single
patient
name
or
differentiate
alzheimer
from
fallen
arches
then
he
saw
the
notice
at
the
top
of
the
page
as
part
of
the
nih
policy
on
privacy
all
patient
data
are
aggregated
and
anonymous
shit
this
was
as
far
as
scrambled
eggs
would
take
him
he
needed
a
higher
security
protocol
to
get
into
data
dale
either
have
it
or
did
dare
give
it
out
well
he
thought
at
least
i
got
information
on
the
structure
of
the
clinical
trials
i
should
print
that
before
the
system
realizes
been
hacked
he
clicked
on
the
print
icon
let
the
games
begin
his
real
objective
was
to
try
to
wangle
an
interview
with
karl
van
de
vliet
an
interview
that
would
have
to
be
approved
by
winston
bartlett
maybe
what
could
be
gleaned
from
this
level
of
the
nih
site
would
be
enough
to
bluff
bartlett
into
thinking
he
knew
more
than
he
really
did
in
truth
interviewing
discharged
patients
would
have
meant
anecdotal
information
probably
not
rigorous
enough
for
use
in
a
definitive
book
but
at
the
moment
that
would
have
been
a
start
he
lifted
the
first
printed
page
and
studied
it
stone
aimes
had
seen
enough
clinical
trials
over
the
years
to
know
that
the
data
were
reported
according
to
an
established
schedule
obviously
the
schedule
was
always
adapted
to
fit
the
nature
of
the
trials
under
way
but
studies
that
produce
the
kind
of
results
gerex
hinted
at
in
their
early
press
releases
before
they
clammed
up
would
probably
have
a
tight
reporting
schedule
possibly
even
weekly
he
stared
at
the
page
for
a
moment
then
lifted
out
another
he
sure
just
yet
what
it
all
meant
but
he
might
be
able
to
infer
something
he
was
still
puzzling
over
the
columns
of
numbers
as
the
data
finished
printing
what
was
it
telling
him
he
went
back
and
clicked
on
study
procedures
this
section
explained
how
the
reporting
was
structured
he
still
held
out
hope
that
the
names
of
the
discharged
patients
in
the
clinical
trials
could
be
accessed
somehow
in
the
past
when
the
fda
tested
drugs
it
often
happened
that
the
names
of
the
participants
were
not
revealed
to
the
monitor
or
to
anybody
the
policy
was
intended
to
preserve
the
privacy
of
study
participants
but
lately
it
had
been
under
review
all
that
secrecy
and
had
permitted
some
spectacular
fabrication
of
test
data
surely
the
nih
had
taken
this
into
consideration
by
now
and
come
up
with
a
system
whereby
the
identities
of
the
participants
could
be
checked
and
verified
that
information
had
to
be
stored
somewhere
no
such
luck
it
appeared
the
nih
had
begun
using
a
modified
version
of
the
new
fda
sunshine
policy
nih
clinical
trials
had
a
one
week
of
sunshine
provision
during
which
the
suitability
of
test
subjects
could
be
evaluated
by
a
review
procedure
during
that
time
their
real
identity
was
in
the
database
but
after
that
the
identity
information
of
any
patient
actually
selected
for
inclusion
in
the
clinical
trials
was
encoded
where
thenceforth
it
could
only
be
accessed
through
a
lengthy
legal
process
screwed
again
at
this
late
date
the
gerex
corporation
surely
was
not
going
to
be
adding
any
new
names
and
giving
them
that
week
of
sunshine
according
to
press
releases
at
the
beginning
of
the
clinical
trials
when
gerex
was
a
lot
more
communicative
at
this
date
the
entire
study
should
be
just
days
away
from
being
wrapped
up
he
went
back
to
the
patient
files
one
last
time
out
of
frustration
as
he
continued
to
scroll
he
noticed
that
although
the
identities
of
patients
and
crucial
personal
data
were
encrypted
the
dates
on
which
they
entered
and
finished
the
trials
were
all
supplied
hmmm
it
was
actually
more
detailed
than
that
there
were
dates
for
when
a
patient
entered
each
stage
of
the
procedure
screening
initial
evaluation
admitted
into
program
procedure
under
way
procedure
monitoring
results
evaluation
patient
release
patient
the
time
between
screening
and
patient
release
averaged
around
five
weeks
six
weeks
at
most
looking
at
the
data
you
could
avoid
the
conclusion
that
the
clinical
trials
had
been
a
spectacular
success
no
doubt
the
specific
data
would
reveal
whether
there
had
been
any
adverse
reactions
but
as
clinical
trials
go
these
seemed
to
have
been
without
major
incident
he
had
a
nose
for
trouble
and
these
looked
as
rigorous
as
clockwork
hold
on
a
second
odd
what
the
data
structure
did
not
have
was
a
category
for
termination
yet
one
of
the
patients
had
been
listed
with
dates
leading
up
to
and
including
procedure
under
way
but
after
that
the
patient
was
noted
parenthetically
as
having
been
terminated
that
was
all
the
information
given
what
could
that
mean
he
leaned
back
with
a
sigh
and
pulled
on
his
brooklyn
lager
okay
patients
frequently
got
dropped
from
clinical
trials
because
some
underlying
condition
suddenly
manifested
itself
and
made
them
unsuitable
trial
subjects
in
fact
that
was
preferable
to
keeping
them
in
a
study
when
they
were
no
longer
appropriate
but
the
thing
about
clinical
trials
was
there
always
had
to
be
a
compelling
fully
explained
reason
for
terminating
a
test
subject
otherwise
you
could
just
terminate
participants
and
skew
the
results
no
reason
was
given
here
he
thought
again
about
the
one
week
of
sunshine
and
as
a
long
shot
checked
to
see
if
anyone
had
been
admitted
this
week
nada
but
again
that
was
reasonable
the
entire
study
was
wrapping
up
which
meant
in
short
that
he
had
nothing
to
work
with
in
terms
of
people
all
he
had
were
dates
and
encrypted
names
what
now
he
finished
the
beer
and
was
preparing
to
go
when
a
screen
flickered
new
data
he
was
being
directed
to
the
new
applicants
sunshine
page
he
clicked
back
then
stared
at
the
screen
a
name
had
appeared
he
could
believe
his
luck
for
some
unknown
reason
they
must
still
be
adding
new
test
subjects
at
this
late
date
in
the
trials
nina
hampton
finally
he
had
a
name
this
was
an
incredible
stroke
of
wait
a
second
name
was
appearing
now
the
letters
popping
up
one
by
one
as
they
were
being
typed
in
he
rolled
the
mouse
to
print
and
felt
his
hopes
surge
then
his
heart
skipped
a
beat
the
second
name
was
alexa
hampton
jesus
could
it
be
no
way
too
big
a
coincidence
but
wait
the
other
was
nina
hampton
is
that
the
name
of
her
brit
mum
that
unredeemable
piece
of
work
impossible
if
it
was
the
ally
hampton
he
knew
she
was
a
woman
he
still
thought
of
every
day
it
went
back
to
when
they
were
both
undergraduates
she
was
taking
a
degree
in
architecture
at
columbia
and
he
had
just
switched
from
premed
to
the
columbia
school
of
journalism
was
there
a
cole
porter
lyric
about
an
affair
being
too
hot
not
to
cool
down
they
undoubtedly
were
in
love
but
they
both
were
too
to
cede
an
inch
of
personal
turf
it
was
a
combustible
situation
when
they
decided
to
go
their
own
way
it
was
done
under
the
agreement
that
they
would
make
a
clean
break
and
never
see
each
other
again
be
adult
and
hold
your
head
high
and
look
to
the
future
no
recriminations
and
no
second
thoughts
in
respecting
that
agreement
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
not
to
keep
track
of
her
he
particularly
did
want
to
know
if
she
gotten
married
had
a
family
any
of
it
thinking
back
now
he
remembered
that
she
had
had
some
kind
of
heart
condition
she
refused
to
talk
about
it
and
now
he
could
remember
exactly
what
it
was
but
that
could
possibly
explain
her
entry
into
the
clinical
trials
though
it
did
clarify
why
she
was
only
being
added
now
at
the
last
minute
if
it
was
actually
her
and
if
so
how
would
he
feel
talking
to
her
he
hoped
time
had
mellowed
her
though
he
somehow
doubted
it
not
ally
what
an
irony
if
it
was
the
same
alexa
hampton
she
could
end
up
being
his
entree
into
the
secretive
world
of
winston
bartlett
gerex
corporation
the
trouble
was
he
was
sure
he
actually
wanted
to
see
her
again
even
after
all
the
years
the
wounds
still
felt
fresh
he
closed
out
the
nih
file
and
opened
people
search
which
he
often
used
to
look
up
phone
numbers
he
started
with
new
york
state
as
a
criterion
the
names
alexa
and
nina
undoubtedly
belonged
to
women
so
they
might
be
listed
merely
by
their
initials
but
start
with
alexa
and
be
optimistic
he
got
lucky
three
names
and
phone
numbers
popped
up
one
was
in
manhattan
and
ally
was
a
new
yorker
but
he
was
sure
he
was
psychologically
prepared
to
speak
to
her
that
number
he
decided
to
save
for
last
though
it
was
by
far
the
most
plausible
the
next
alexa
hampton
lived
in
syracuse
with
area
code
he
was
still
shook
up
as
he
dialed
the
number
yeah
who
this
sure
did
sound
like
ally
but
he
was
playing
this
straight
as
a
reporter
he
always
started
a
conversation
by
identifying
himself
so
naturally
he
answered
stone
aimes
new
york
sentinel
the
fuck
you
want
came
the
voice
it
was
female
but
it
definitely
was
not
ladylike
i
do
need
any
newspapers
whoa
that
definitely
did
sound
like
ally
she
was
direct
but
she
did
talk
like
a
sailor
sorry
i
have
a
few
questions
about
your
participation
in
some
clinical
trials
sorry
to
bother
you
but
i
have
a
deadline
take
a
minute
you
a
fucking
reporter
i
doing
a
story
on
the
gerex
corporation
are
you
the
what
corporation
the
fuck
you
talking
about
seems
like
i
calling
the
wrong
number
i
very
sorry
and
i
apologize
listen
if
you
some
kind
of
weirdo
i
going
to
call
the
cops
and
have
this
call
traced
i
said
i
apologize
he
hung
up
and
thought
about
another
beer
this
was
beginning
to
feel
like
the
moment
but
he
resisted
the
urge
and
called
the
next
number
come
on
be
the
right
one
and
do
be
ally
this
one
had
a
area
code
that
meant
long
island
hello
came
a
rusty
old
voice
that
had
to
be
in
its
seventies
it
sounded
oversmoked
and
just
hanging
on
again
definitely
not
the
ally
he
knew
hello
he
said
i
sorry
to
bother
you
but
are
you
trying
to
sell
me
something
young
man
the
woman
asked
it
not
going
to
do
you
much
good
i
live
on
a
social
security
check
and
it
all
i
can
do
to
make
ends
meet
as
is
you
sound
nice
but
no
i
a
newspaper
reporter
i
doing
a
story
on
i
just
wanted
to
follow
up
on
your
admission
to
the
clinical
trials
for
the
gerex
corporation
he
felt
a
surge
of
hope
it
was
ally
but
she
did
sound
like
a
woman
who
might
well
be
a
candidate
for
medical
treatment
do
you
know
what
day
you
plan
to
start
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
she
asked
young
man
it
ill
manners
to
start
asking
a
body
silly
questions
no
matter
how
nice
you
might
be
otherwise
i
never
heard
of
this
whatever
you
called
it
corporation
click
she
sure
did
sound
like
a
patient
or
maybe
she
was
too
far
gone
to
even
know
if
she
was
a
patient
or
not
in
any
case
this
was
not
a
promising
lead
okay
he
thought
go
with
the
one
you
should
have
in
the
first
place
blast
he
wanted
this
to
be
the
one
but
he
just
did
want
it
to
be
ally
or
maybe
he
did
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
punched
in
the
last
number
which
had
a
manhattan
area
code
the
phone
at
the
other
end
rang
five
times
and
then
an
answering
machine
came
on
at
this
hour
she
would
most
likely
be
at
work
hello
this
is
alexa
hampton
i
sorry
i
ca
come
to
the
phone
now
but
if
you
leave
your
name
and
number
i
get
back
to
you
as
soon
as
possible
if
you
calling
about
design
work
the
number
of
citispace
is
he
felt
his
heart
flip
then
sink
it
was
ally
it
was
a
voice
he
had
heard
for
years
in
his
reveries
or
were
they
the
nightmares
of
roads
not
taken
she
still
might
not
be
the
new
patient
in
the
clinical
trials
but
at
least
he
knew
he
could
reach
her
the
sound
of
her
voice
after
all
this
time
he
did
realize
it
would
still
affect
him
the
way
it
did
so
he
thought
clearing
his
head
she
running
a
design
business
now
he
wondered
how
that
had
happened
the
last
time
he
saw
her
she
was
a
student
of
architecture
intensely
focused
no
message
do
leave
a
message
it
probably
would
freak
her
out
actually
it
might
freak
them
both
out
assuming
she
was
the
new
patient
how
the
hell
did
ally
get
involved
with
winston
bartlett
it
probably
would
have
something
to
do
with
that
heart
condition
she
did
like
to
talk
about
he
clicked
off
the
phone
and
settled
it
onto
the
desk
then
he
glanced
again
at
the
computer
screen
and
decided
to
go
back
to
the
nih
files
the
other
woman
nina
he
would
look
up
later
ally
brit
mum
must
be
getting
on
by
now
but
still
it
was
hard
to
imagine
anything
being
wrong
with
her
as
he
remembered
nina
the
woman
was
well
nigh
indestructible
when
he
got
back
to
the
nih
web
site
and
went
to
the
sunshine
page
it
was
again
blank
the
two
new
names
nina
hampton
and
alexa
hampton
were
not
there
anymore
they
must
have
been
entered
immediately
into
the
clinical
trials
but
why
now
if
van
de
vliet
kept
to
the
original
schedule
the
trials
would
be
over
in
a
matter
of
days
maybe
he
thought
this
was
a
momentary
i
just
happened
to
be
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
fleeting
moment
when
somebody
somewhere
was
entering
those
names
maybe
some
nih
bureaucrat
hit
the
wrong
key
on
a
keyboard
someplace
in
maryland
but
it
was
the
break
he
been
waiting
for
he
turned
off
the
ibm
and
headed
for
the
fridge
and
another
brooklyn
lager
ally
ally
ally
can
it
be
you
this
is
so
weird
worse
than
that
it
was
painful
there
was
that
immortal
line
from
casablanca
of
all
the
gin
joints
in
all
she
walks
into
mine
why
you
dear
god
coming
back
he
sat
down
took
a
long
hit
on
the
icy
bottle
and
reached
for
the
phone
chapter
april
as
she
hung
up
ally
wondered
again
what
she
was
getting
into
but
she
did
want
to
meet
this
miracle
worker
the
kind
of
thing
van
de
vliet
was
talking
about
sounded
as
much
like
science
fiction
as
anything
she
ever
heard
still
his
voice
was
reassuring
even
mesmerizing
and
there
seemed
no
reason
not
to
at
least
check
out
the
dorian
institute
firsthand
but
then
what
help
she
looked
at
her
coffee
cup
and
wished
she
dared
have
a
refill
but
that
much
caffeine
always
made
her
heart
start
to
act
up
and
maybe
she
did
need
it
the
conversation
with
karl
van
de
vliet
had
energized
her
and
sharpened
her
senses
quite
enough
she
was
still
thinking
about
that
when
the
phone
rang
again
there
was
an
electronic
voice
directory
but
her
own
phone
was
the
default
if
a
caller
did
not
care
to
use
it
citispace
hi
ally
tell
me
if
you
recognize
the
voice
just
please
do
hang
up
who
was
it
the
intonations
were
bouncing
around
somewhere
in
the
back
of
her
brain
as
though
they
were
a
computer
file
looking
for
a
match
the
one
her
unconscious
mind
was
making
was
being
rejected
by
her
conscious
mind
then
finally
the
match
came
through
and
stuck
my
god
it
could
be
the
last
time
she
talked
to
him
was
what
almost
two
decades
ago
the
irony
was
she
been
thinking
about
him
some
lately
as
part
of
taking
stock
of
her
life
she
been
meditating
over
all
the
roads
not
taken
and
he
been
the
last
man
she
actually
loved
or
thought
she
loved
before
steve
what
how
did
she
found
she
was
at
a
loss
for
words
she
figured
he
have
been
the
same
way
if
she
called
him
out
of
the
blue
hey
this
is
easy
for
me
either
but
i
have
a
pretty
good
reason
for
breaking
our
vow
of
silence
she
was
immediately
flooded
with
mixed
emotions
stone
aimes
she
already
knew
he
wrote
for
the
sentinel
or
at
least
she
assumed
the
irreverent
reporter
by
that
name
who
did
their
medical
column
was
him
the
tone
sounded
so
much
like
the
way
she
remembered
him
there
was
a
lot
of
passion
and
he
was
always
editorializing
against
big
medicine
he
had
plenty
of
raw
courage
but
sometimes
he
had
too
much
edge
that
was
one
quality
he
had
that
had
eventually
gotten
to
be
back
when
they
were
together
now
in
hindsight
she
remembered
their
breakup
with
both
anger
and
regret
she
was
angry
that
even
though
she
tried
like
hell
she
could
never
really
connect
with
him
at
the
level
she
yearned
for
he
always
seemed
to
be
holding
something
back
some
secret
he
was
afraid
to
divulge
truthfully
they
both
were
grand
masters
at
never
allowing
vulnerability
in
short
they
were
overly
alike
they
shared
the
same
flaws
still
after
steve
was
taken
away
it
was
hard
not
to
think
of
stone
now
and
then
before
steve
stone
was
the
only
sane
lover
she
ever
been
close
to
but
she
also
knew
the
bit
about
letting
sleeping
dogs
lie
sometimes
that
was
the
better
part
of
wisdom
this
conversation
she
finally
decided
was
just
going
to
open
old
wounds
better
to
nip
it
right
now
and
add
to
that
she
did
actually
know
if
he
was
free
now
or
not
or
what
but
he
said
he
had
a
good
reason
for
calling
what
could
that
be
stone
i
read
your
columns
in
the
sentinel
so
i
sort
of
feel
like
i
kept
in
contact
i
can
almost
hear
your
voice
sometimes
that
makes
me
think
you
were
cheating
a
little
on
our
deal
well
she
heard
herself
say
some
of
them
were
pretty
good
sometimes
you
sounded
like
you
knew
as
much
as
a
doctor
do
flatter
me
excessively
or
i
might
want
to
start
believing
you
he
laughed
but
speaking
of
doctors
did
you
used
to
have
some
kind
of
heart
issue
how
is
that
these
days
you
really
want
to
know
maybe
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
why
i
calling
best
i
recall
you
never
actually
told
me
even
back
when
thank
you
for
asking
she
said
i
guess
it
not
much
of
a
secret
anymore
with
me
popping
nitro
every
other
day
i
have
a
scarred
valve
coronary
stenosis
and
it
not
getting
any
better
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
it
short
of
going
to
lourdes
for
a
miracle
i
see
he
said
then
he
fell
silent
mercifully
he
did
come
up
with
false
bravado
about
revolutionary
treatments
and
you
never
can
tell
blah
blah
blah
then
he
said
so
is
that
why
you
enrolled
in
the
clinical
trials
at
the
dorian
institute
to
be
part
of
their
work
using
stem
cells
what
how
the
hell
do
you
know
about
hey
ally
you
know
i
ca
divulge
my
sources
after
i
knew
you
i
grew
up
to
be
a
real
reporter
that
was
my
grand
plan
remember
then
this
may
turn
out
to
be
a
very
short
conversation
i
have
nothing
to
okay
okay
let
start
over
he
paused
and
cleared
his
throat
ahem
are
you
the
alexa
hampton
who
was
formally
entered
about
half
an
hour
ago
into
the
clinical
trials
for
the
national
institutes
of
health
being
held
by
the
gerex
corporation
or
maybe
i
should
play
dumb
and
begin
by
asking
if
you
ever
heard
of
them
stone
why
why
are
you
asking
me
this
it
was
bizarre
how
could
he
know
and
wait
a
minute
what
did
he
mean
about
enrolling
she
had
enrolled
in
anything
ally
i
finishing
a
major
i
hope
book
about
stem
cell
technology
and
right
now
the
world
leader
is
the
gerex
corporation
i
think
but
i
ca
yet
prove
that
their
dorian
institute
out
in
new
jersey
is
the
site
of
some
pretty
incredible
stuff
i
was
fooling
around
on
the
internet
on
the
nih
web
site
looking
for
information
about
them
and
it
must
have
been
some
momentary
computer
glitch
someone
with
your
name
popped
up
for
a
second
along
with
a
nina
hampton
which
made
me
suspect
it
was
you
she
was
incredulous
she
was
being
entered
into
the
clinical
trials
before
she
had
even
seen
the
place
somebody
was
pushing
the
pace
winston
bartlett
or
van
de
vliet
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
she
and
her
mother
would
enter
the
trials
worst
of
all
it
took
a
former
lover
she
had
talked
to
in
years
to
give
her
this
unnerving
information
nina
is
your
mom
right
he
went
on
i
still
remember
her
fondly
i
do
think
she
thought
much
of
me
however
by
the
way
how
is
she
she
she
not
doing
all
that
great
ally
was
still
trying
to
get
her
mind
around
what
she
just
heard
but
why
are
you
calling
me
stone
if
anything
i
said
rings
a
vague
bell
then
could
we
meet
someplace
and
talk
i
do
think
it
would
be
a
great
idea
to
do
it
over
the
phone
that
all
i
really
can
say
now
maybe
she
thought
stone
aimes
might
have
uncovered
a
few
things
of
which
she
ought
to
be
aware
his
pieces
in
the
sentinel
showed
he
was
a
damned
good
reporter
i
do
think
what
little
i
know
about
gerex
would
be
any
help
to
you
she
was
attempting
to
get
her
mind
back
together
i
actually
have
a
lot
of
questions
about
the
stem
cell
procedure
myself
i
spoke
on
the
phone
just
now
with
van
de
vliet
and
he
described
their
technology
to
me
in
general
terms
but
maybe
i
should
interview
you
maybe
you
could
explain
it
to
me
using
that
wonderful
gift
you
have
for
simplification
in
your
columns
ally
i
do
know
anything
except
what
in
the
public
domain
they
privately
held
so
they
do
have
to
tell
anybody
zilch
i
assume
you
actually
been
out
to
the
dorian
institute
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
never
but
you
enrolled
i
not
enrolled
in
anything
to
say
the
least
and
it
bothers
me
that
anybody
thinks
so
but
i
am
thinking
about
taking
mom
out
there
tomorrow
if
she
still
wants
to
go
when
i
talked
to
him
on
the
phone
van
de
vliet
wanted
me
to
start
the
procedure
immediately
scary
but
he
does
seem
to
know
what
he
doing
i
take
it
then
that
you
leaning
toward
going
through
with
it
she
hated
the
way
he
just
made
her
sound
so
gullible
the
truth
is
i
more
concerned
for
mom
he
claims
he
can
help
her
alzheimer
and
that
would
mean
a
lot
why
was
she
telling
him
all
this
stuff
she
found
herself
wondering
if
he
ever
married
i
so
sorry
to
hear
that
but
the
chances
are
he
can
what
are
you
thinking
she
asked
finally
and
why
did
you
call
me
really
what
going
on
i
do
know
yet
there
a
lot
i
do
know
he
seemed
to
hesitate
ally
is
there
any
chance
whatsoever
that
while
you
out
there
you
could
get
me
the
names
of
some
of
the
people
who
been
through
the
clinical
trials
the
dorian
institute
is
entirely
to
the
press
i
tried
several
times
to
schedule
an
interview
with
karl
van
de
vliet
the
guy
you
talked
to
but
no
luck
i
ca
get
past
the
corporate
people
my
only
hope
is
to
try
and
find
some
patients
who
been
treated
and
released
who
completed
the
clinical
trials
but
gerex
has
been
ruthless
about
keeping
their
identities
secret
you
are
literally
the
first
person
i
found
who
has
any
connection
with
the
institute
and
is
willing
to
talk
about
it
that
is
you
willing
stone
it
would
be
like
the
blind
leading
the
blind
i
do
know
the
first
thing
about
the
place
well
let
me
ask
you
this
when
you
were
talking
with
him
did
van
de
vliet
happen
to
mention
any
occasion
where
a
subject
had
been
terminated
from
the
trials
it
never
came
up
why
do
you
never
mind
but
when
and
if
you
go
out
there
you
might
inquire
about
that
he
paused
do
get
me
wrong
i
actually
gerex
biggest
fan
i
mean
considering
merely
what
you
told
me
that
they
claiming
to
have
a
procedure
that
treats
alzheimer
think
about
it
i
rooting
for
your
mom
sure
but
that
a
nobel
prize
in
itself
right
there
we
talking
major
medical
history
in
the
making
and
and
i
want
to
publish
the
first
book
about
it
he
paused
also
a
little
birdie
tells
me
that
something
not
entirely
kosher
may
be
going
on
out
there
no
proof
just
a
reporter
hunch
there
a
little
too
much
sudden
secrecy
ally
was
having
a
strange
feeling
come
over
her
she
was
actually
enjoying
talking
to
him
shit
stone
i
glad
you
called
i
lost
two
men
i
loved
very
much
since
i
knew
you
and
i
feeling
very
alone
at
the
moment
i
could
use
some
moral
support
i
got
a
lot
of
people
bugging
me
to
enter
those
clinical
trials
even
people
i
never
met
before
like
winston
bartlett
the
new
york
big
shot
he
suddenly
very
concerned
about
my
health
i
have
no
idea
what
that
about
but
it
makes
me
uneasy
there
was
an
awkward
lull
then
ally
all
i
asking
is
that
you
just
take
the
measure
of
the
dorian
institute
when
you
out
there
and
tell
me
what
you
think
about
the
place
are
they
performing
the
miracles
they
announced
as
their
objective
look
i
help
you
when
and
if
i
actually
can
so
give
me
your
number
okay
he
did
i
can
tell
when
i
being
blown
off
he
went
on
i
have
a
very
sensitive
detector
but
why
do
you
try
a
test
when
out
at
the
institute
ask
van
de
vliet
or
somebody
why
that
mystery
patient
was
terminated
from
the
clinical
trials
see
if
the
question
makes
them
uncomfortable
why
does
that
matter
so
much
to
you
if
a
patient
is
dropped
for
no
good
reason
about
the
same
time
they
clamp
down
on
information
i
think
it
could
be
fishy
beyond
that
i
can
not
speculate
and
while
you
at
it
i
love
the
names
of
some
other
anybody
i
found
a
list
on
the
nih
web
site
but
they
all
encoded
so
it
does
do
me
any
good
i
just
want
to
ask
them
if
the
procedure
worked
or
not
it
information
that
going
to
be
made
public
eventually
no
matter
what
come
on
ally
do
you
want
some
testimonials
okay
look
i
try
to
see
if
anybody
there
will
give
me
any
info
she
was
realizing
she
was
in
a
comfort
zone
when
she
was
talking
to
him
still
so
much
about
him
remained
a
mystery
he
had
always
said
his
mother
and
father
were
both
dead
but
it
was
still
suspiciously
hard
to
get
him
to
speak
about
them
she
gotten
the
impression
that
he
did
actually
remember
his
father
that
was
the
part
of
his
life
that
he
always
been
the
most
closed
off
about
either
that
or
he
was
repressing
some
horrible
memories
thanks
a
lot
ally
a
pause
then
interested
in
getting
together
sometime
let
me
think
about
it
she
put
down
the
phone
with
her
mind
in
turmoil
she
realized
she
had
asked
him
if
he
was
attached
but
the
next
time
they
spoke
she
was
going
to
try
to
ease
it
into
the
conversation
chapter
april
steered
her
toyota
onto
the
ramp
leading
to
the
george
washington
bridge
the
entryway
to
northern
new
jersey
she
was
just
finishing
a
phone
call
to
jennifer
she
wanted
her
to
take
a
look
at
the
notes
and
blueprints
for
bartlett
gramercy
park
project
and
scan
them
into
their
cad
program
after
all
the
phone
calls
yesterday
she
been
too
sidetracked
to
do
it
although
bartlett
had
declared
he
was
in
any
hurry
he
had
messengered
a
certified
check
to
her
office
monday
afternoon
the
project
was
a
go
she
wanted
to
get
moving
while
everything
was
fresh
in
her
mind
before
leaving
her
apartment
this
morning
she
downloaded
a
map
from
mapquest
and
from
it
she
had
estimated
that
the
drive
up
to
the
dorian
institute
would
be
approximately
an
hour
give
or
take
she
had
begun
the
trip
early
because
her
mother
mind
had
been
lucid
the
previous
evening
and
she
was
hoping
that
interlude
might
last
into
this
morning
unfortunately
it
had
not
nina
was
sitting
next
to
her
now
in
full
makeup
but
completely
unresponsive
seemingly
in
another
world
when
ally
arrived
at
the
riverside
drive
apartment
to
pick
her
up
maria
now
silent
and
uneasy
in
the
backseat
reading
a
spanish
novel
met
her
at
the
door
with
a
troubled
look
and
shook
her
head
sadly
miss
hampton
i
know
she
was
all
right
when
you
were
here
last
night
but
this
morning
she
may
not
recognize
you
she
most
likely
snap
out
of
it
and
be
okay
later
on
but
right
now
she
just
in
a
fog
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
her
ready
when
ally
walked
in
nina
was
sitting
in
her
favorite
chair
dressed
in
her
favorite
black
suit
her
makeup
was
perfect
thank
you
maria
hey
sweetie
you
look
great
nina
stared
at
her
as
though
trying
to
place
the
face
and
said
nothing
she
just
looked
confused
and
very
very
sad
dear
god
ally
thought
this
is
the
first
time
she
completely
failed
to
recognize
me
it
was
so
disheartening
last
night
when
ally
had
come
up
to
discuss
whether
or
not
she
still
wanted
to
explore
van
de
experimental
treatment
nina
had
been
completely
cognizant
ally
had
tried
to
explain
the
concept
of
neural
tissue
regeneration
using
stem
cells
which
was
difficult
since
she
barely
understood
it
herself
mom
she
had
said
this
might
be
something
that
could
reverse
some
of
the
damage
to
your
memory
at
least
keep
it
from
getting
worse
i
know
it
sounds
scary
but
everybody
says
the
conventional
treatments
for
what
you
have
do
work
very
well
or
very
long
then
let
go
out
there
and
talk
to
him
honey
just
come
in
the
morning
and
take
me
by
then
i
probably
forget
everything
said
tonight
how
prescient
ally
thought
sadly
now
nina
was
just
gazing
blankly
ahead
silent
does
she
remember
anything
from
last
night
for
that
matter
what
was
nina
thinking
now
was
she
conscious
of
the
fact
she
was
losing
her
mind
and
what
about
the
ultimate
question
do
we
want
to
live
longer
merely
to
be
alive
or
do
we
want
to
stay
alive
in
order
to
do
things
to
be
or
to
do
in
her
mother
case
she
knew
it
was
the
latter
nina
had
always
been
full
of
life
ambition
and
projects
would
she
want
to
go
on
living
if
none
of
those
things
were
possible
you
never
know
for
sure
about
other
people
even
your
own
mother
but
ally
suspected
she
would
rather
not
live
to
see
that
day
now
though
was
she
even
aware
it
was
coming
ally
thought
back
about
the
first
signs
nina
had
yet
turned
five
when
she
abruptly
started
having
trouble
remembering
little
things
she
began
forgetting
where
she
put
items
and
she
gave
up
on
remembering
phone
numbers
and
dates
initially
it
had
just
seemed
like
a
lot
of
senior
moments
run
together
very
puzzling
but
then
it
got
worse
she
always
loved
music
and
she
always
played
the
piano
she
loved
chopin
especially
the
nocturnes
by
the
time
she
was
however
she
was
having
trouble
remembering
the
names
of
her
favorite
composers
she
also
completely
gave
up
trying
to
play
either
from
memory
or
with
the
music
when
getting
dressed
one
day
she
put
on
her
blouse
completely
backwards
it
was
bad
ally
had
taken
her
to
see
four
different
specialists
and
they
all
had
concluded
that
nina
hampton
suffered
from
what
was
known
as
familial
alzheimer
it
was
caused
by
a
mutated
gene
and
was
extremely
rare
representing
only
some
percent
of
all
cases
there
were
two
major
drugs
currently
on
the
market
exelon
and
reminyl
that
could
relieve
some
of
the
symptoms
of
alzheimer
by
boosting
the
action
of
the
brain
chemical
acetylcholine
however
nina
had
not
yet
declined
to
the
stage
where
doctors
would
prescribe
those
drugs
to
resort
to
them
was
an
admission
you
were
at
endgame
since
they
usually
were
effective
only
for
a
few
months
so
the
dorian
institute
might
well
be
a
long
shot
worth
taking
frankly
what
to
lose
this
morning
she
knew
was
going
to
be
difficult
if
nina
wanted
to
stay
and
checked
in
there
would
surely
be
a
pile
of
paperwork
ally
had
had
the
foresight
to
acquire
power
of
attorney
for
her
mother
three
months
earlier
and
she
brought
along
that
document
in
case
it
might
be
needed
and
maria
the
wonderful
ultimate
caregiver
was
there
to
help
the
real
challenge
however
might
well
be
trying
to
help
nina
understand
what
was
going
on
and
participate
in
the
decision
this
was
the
moment
every
child
dreads
when
you
have
to
face
really
face
a
parent
mortality
as
the
green
forests
of
northern
new
jersey
began
to
envelop
them
she
slipped
a
cd
of
bach
partitas
for
unaccompanied
violin
into
the
cd
player
she
had
loved
to
play
them
all
her
life
but
now
ekelman
had
urged
her
to
put
her
violin
into
storage
hearing
the
violin
now
reminded
her
of
the
other
purpose
of
the
trip
the
treatment
decision
she
needed
to
make
for
herself
in
that
regard
one
of
the
things
that
kept
running
through
her
mind
was
what
stone
aimes
had
said
about
the
gerex
corporation
instituting
a
news
blackout
simultaneously
with
a
patient
being
mysteriously
dropped
from
the
trials
those
concurrent
facts
did
not
need
to
be
ominous
but
they
also
could
use
an
explanation
what
was
she
going
to
do
was
van
de
vliet
stem
cell
procedure
on
her
heart
really
worth
the
risk
she
honestly
did
know
even
though
the
violin
had
temporarily
been
taken
away
from
her
she
had
hopes
she
could
gradually
get
it
back
there
were
other
ways
to
try
to
strengthen
a
dysfunctional
heart
well
she
thought
wait
and
hear
him
out
from
the
george
washington
bridge
she
had
taken
which
turned
into
and
now
the
green
forest
held
sway
it
felt
like
she
gone
through
a
time
warp
from
the
beginning
of
the
century
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
then
finally
as
the
second
partita
was
ending
the
greenwood
lake
came
into
view
it
was
associated
with
those
long
finger
lakes
gouged
out
by
glaciers
driving
past
remnants
of
the
last
ice
age
she
reflected
on
how
insignificant
humans
are
in
the
scheme
of
things
suddenly
she
thought
of
aldous
huxley
novel
after
many
a
summer
dies
the
swan
about
a
wealthy
madman
who
discovered
a
way
to
prolong
life
by
eating
the
entrails
of
prehistoric
fish
maybe
it
was
seeing
the
lake
that
made
her
flash
on
that
she
was
now
on
greenwood
lake
road
which
passed
around
the
west
side
and
there
were
numbers
on
several
gated
driveways
as
she
passed
along
she
suspected
the
place
would
be
somewhere
along
the
middle
of
the
lakeshore
and
she
was
right
after
a
few
miles
she
came
to
a
discreet
sign
announcing
the
dorian
institute
and
a
large
iron
gate
that
protected
a
paved
roadway
leading
into
a
forest
of
trees
that
was
it
just
forest
no
hint
of
a
building
though
she
saw
signs
of
some
kind
of
industrial
park
farther
down
the
road
when
she
drove
up
to
the
gate
she
realized
there
was
a
video
camera
and
a
intercom
when
she
reached
out
of
the
window
and
pushed
the
talk
button
she
heard
good
morning
and
then
the
gates
parted
in
the
middle
and
slid
back
they
must
be
expecting
us
she
thought
and
drove
through
the
road
was
cobblestone
or
rough
paving
brick
it
wound
among
the
trees
for
approximately
half
a
mile
and
then
widened
there
framed
by
the
lake
in
the
background
was
a
magnificent
story
building
with
eight
doric
columns
across
the
front
in
perfect
greek
revival
style
there
were
windows
at
ground
level
but
they
were
heavily
curtained
built
of
red
brick
the
building
probably
dated
from
the
late
nineteenth
century
and
it
looked
every
bit
like
an
ivy
league
dormitory
miss
hampton
i
do
like
the
feeling
i
getting
about
this
place
maria
said
quietly
it
is
very
cold
and
formal
from
the
outside
but
inside
i
sense
a
place
where
there
is
bad
magic
in
the
dominican
republic
we
call
it
santeria
i
can
always
tell
these
things
ally
knew
and
respected
maria
sixth
sense
but
then
maria
sometimes
still
acted
like
a
freshly
minted
citizen
just
off
a
green
card
and
she
had
an
innate
suspicion
of
evoking
buildings
her
aversion
to
the
dorian
institute
might
be
nothing
more
than
that
on
the
other
hand
ally
was
having
a
bit
of
the
same
feeling
there
was
something
formidable
and
foreboding
about
the
place
that
seemed
out
of
keeping
with
its
supposedly
benign
purpose
she
felt
a
moment
of
tightness
in
her
chest
there
was
a
parking
area
off
to
the
left
and
she
drove
into
the
nearest
slot
and
turned
off
her
engine
this
was
the
moment
she
been
both
anticipating
and
dreading
the
clock
on
the
dash
read
fifteen
she
was
fifteen
minutes
ahead
of
the
appointed
hour
okay
mom
how
do
you
feel
nina
turned
and
stared
at
her
uncertainty
in
her
eyes
where
are
we
ally
i
do
recognize
anything
this
is
the
institute
i
told
you
about
last
night
can
you
remember
anything
we
talked
about
then
this
is
the
place
you
were
did
you
say
there
a
doctor
here
who
can
do
something
for
my
memory
we
both
here
now
to
just
talk
to
him
she
turned
to
the
backseat
maria
can
you
get
mom
purse
she
nodded
then
reached
hesitantly
for
the
door
she
was
clearly
reluctant
to
get
out
ally
walked
around
and
opened
the
door
for
her
mother
okay
mom
time
to
stretch
your
legs
ally
held
her
hand
and
together
they
headed
across
the
oval
brick
driveway
birds
were
chirping
around
them
and
she
could
smell
the
scent
of
the
lake
borne
up
the
hill
by
a
fresh
wind
then
through
the
trees
she
saw
two
women
walking
up
the
trail
that
led
down
to
the
lake
they
were
she
assumed
some
of
the
patients
they
both
looked
to
be
in
their
early
sixties
but
also
athletic
and
nimble
one
was
wearing
nikes
and
a
pale
green
pantsuit
the
other
had
on
a
blue
dress
and
a
white
cap
and
ally
realized
she
must
be
a
nurse
she
been
taking
the
other
woman
out
for
a
stroll
they
were
engrossed
in
conversation
but
as
they
approached
the
woman
ally
had
decided
was
on
staff
looked
up
and
smiled
a
greeting
can
i
help
you
she
introduced
herself
and
nina
and
maria
the
woman
smiled
again
but
did
introduce
herself
in
turn
we
here
to
see
van
de
vliet
ally
went
on
about
the
trials
but
we
a
couple
of
minutes
early
and
i
was
wondering
if
we
could
look
around
a
bit
first
i
trying
to
understand
what
the
institute
is
really
like
well
dear
the
woman
said
even
those
of
us
who
work
here
allowed
everywhere
you
know
into
the
research
lab
in
the
basement
some
places
here
have
to
be
completely
hygienic
of
course
for
patients
who
are
in
the
recovery
phase
strolling
around
outside
is
definitely
recommended
as
long
as
they
able
but
that
getting
way
ahead
of
ourselves
first
we
have
to
check
you
in
there
a
lot
of
paperwork
for
the
clinical
trials
she
seemed
puzzled
they
almost
over
you
know
but
come
along
and
i
let
him
know
you
here
always
down
in
the
lab
at
this
time
of
the
morning
it
well
after
his
rounds
they
so
busy
now
then
she
turned
to
the
other
woman
sophie
do
you
think
you
can
find
your
way
back
to
your
room
it
number
on
the
second
floor
remember
sophie
appeared
to
be
pondering
the
question
for
a
long
moment
before
she
huffed
do
be
silly
i
know
exactly
where
it
is
as
she
strode
on
ahead
the
nurse
watched
her
carefully
as
though
unsure
what
she
might
do
next
she
pushed
a
buzzer
at
the
door
and
then
a
man
in
a
white
uniform
opened
it
and
let
her
in
only
after
sophie
had
disappeared
through
the
doorway
did
the
nurse
turn
back
i
elise
baker
please
forgive
sophie
if
she
seems
a
little
confused
her
procedure
is
still
under
way
her
what
she
was
diagnosed
with
parkinson
before
she
came
here
improved
an
enormous
amount
but
we
not
allowed
to
say
so
why
is
that
we
in
clinical
trials
no
one
is
allowed
to
discuss
our
results
everyone
here
had
to
sign
a
secrecy
agreement
now
maria
was
helping
nina
up
the
steps
the
porch
with
its
soaring
white
doric
columns
was
definitely
magisterial
the
front
door
however
was
not
wooden
or
decorative
it
was
solid
steel
albeit
painted
white
to
blend
in
elise
walked
to
the
door
which
had
a
video
camera
mounted
above
it
and
a
split
second
later
it
buzzed
signaling
it
was
unlocked
this
is
a
lot
of
security
ally
thought
for
a
clinic
doing
research
on
cells
are
they
worried
about
spies
getting
in
or
patients
getting
out
but
the
locked
steel
door
was
just
the
beginning
of
the
security
next
they
entered
a
small
room
just
inside
the
door
with
an
machine
to
see
into
purses
and
parcels
the
first
floor
is
reception
and
dining
elise
explained
as
she
swept
through
the
metal
detector
there
are
rooms
we
call
them
suites
upstairs
for
patients
and
the
research
lab
and
offices
are
in
the
lower
area
what
what
is
all
this
security
for
ally
asked
the
work
here
is
highly
proprietary
no
one
is
allowed
to
bring
in
any
kind
of
camera
or
recording
equipment
the
guard
dressed
in
white
looked
like
a
retired
policeman
with
perhaps
a
few
too
many
jelly
doughnuts
over
his
career
he
had
a
beefy
red
face
and
a
hefty
spare
tire
but
he
was
certainly
alert
to
his
responsibilities
eyeing
the
three
newcomers
with
scarcely
disguised
suspicion
in
fact
ally
sensed
a
palpable
paranoia
in
the
air
well
she
told
herself
medical
research
is
a
game
it
understandable
they
would
be
concerned
about
industrial
espionage
after
the
security
check
they
went
through
another
steel
door
and
entered
the
actual
lobby
the
first
thing
she
noticed
was
a
grand
staircase
leading
up
to
the
second
floor
and
then
to
the
third
off
to
the
right
was
a
modern
elevator
with
a
shiny
steel
door
a
number
of
patients
were
coming
down
the
stairs
and
heading
for
a
hallway
leading
to
the
back
they
were
mostly
women
whose
ages
ranged
anywhere
from
to
well
beyond
seventy
who
are
these
people
ally
wondered
they
must
have
been
sufferers
of
various
kinds
of
debilitating
afflictions
but
now
they
were
certainly
ambulatory
if
not
downright
sprightly
she
wanted
to
talk
to
some
of
them
watching
them
moving
along
chatting
and
smiling
but
this
was
not
the
moment
at
we
have
meditation
in
the
dining
hall
elise
was
saying
as
she
led
them
through
the
lobby
for
those
who
care
to
participate
and
after
that
a
vegetarian
lunch
is
served
at
thirty
sharp
then
she
glanced
back
after
you
see
van
de
vliet
and
assuming
you
admitted
there
be
an
orientation
and
then
welcome
to
begin
participating
fully
in
our
activities
actually
ally
said
if
people
are
well
enough
to
be
in
why
ca
they
be
outpatients
these
clinical
trials
require
supervision
elise
explained
heading
for
the
wide
desk
in
the
center
of
the
room
now
if
you
would
all
sign
in
here
at
the
desk
ellen
can
take
you
downstairs
to
the
medical
reception
a
woman
smiled
from
behind
the
desk
then
got
up
and
came
around
a
book
was
there
on
a
steel
stand
ally
finally
noticed
that
light
classical
music
was
wafting
through
the
room
swan
lake
suite
you
must
be
hampton
the
woman
said
and
this
must
be
your
mother
we
were
told
to
expect
you
she
nodded
a
farewell
to
elise
who
said
it
was
so
nice
to
meet
you
good
luck
she
then
turned
and
headed
for
the
back
ally
signed
all
three
of
them
in
good
the
woman
said
as
she
checked
the
information
my
name
is
ellen
by
the
way
i
in
charge
of
the
nursing
staff
here
we
ready
to
go
downstairs
now
ellen
had
a
knowing
earnest
face
that
fairly
lit
up
when
she
smiled
she
had
short
brown
hair
streaked
with
gray
and
was
pleasantly
when
they
reached
the
elevator
she
zipped
a
small
plastic
card
through
the
reader
on
the
wall
and
the
doors
slid
open
as
they
emerged
on
the
lower
level
ally
realized
they
were
in
the
precincts
of
a
very
sophisticated
medical
laboratory
occupying
most
of
the
floor
was
a
area
inside
of
which
she
could
see
three
men
and
two
women
all
dressed
in
white
she
also
noticed
rows
of
steel
containers
that
seemed
to
be
ovens
or
incubators
of
some
kind
as
well
as
racks
and
racks
of
vials
at
the
far
end
of
the
laboratory
there
was
a
blackboard
on
which
one
of
the
men
was
drawing
something
that
looked
like
hexagonal
molecules
linking
them
together
that
van
de
vliet
ellen
said
pointing
i
let
him
know
you
here
the
laboratory
is
a
special
environment
the
entrance
there
is
actually
an
air
lock
the
air
inside
is
filtered
and
kept
under
positive
pressure
she
walked
over
to
a
communications
module
buzzed
then
announced
into
the
microphone
vee
your
thirty
appointment
is
here
he
turned
and
stared
in
their
direction
then
smiled
and
waved
next
he
walked
to
a
microphone
near
the
center
of
the
room
and
clicked
it
on
i
be
with
you
in
a
minute
can
you
please
wait
in
the
receiving
room
and
ellen
can
you
start
getting
them
ready
of
course
she
nodded
then
clicked
off
the
microphone
and
turned
receiving
is
just
down
at
the
end
of
the
hall
next
to
his
office
please
come
with
me
she
led
them
through
a
large
wooden
door
into
a
room
with
a
retractable
metal
table
covered
in
white
paper
and
several
chairs
it
was
a
typical
examination
room
with
a
device
on
the
wall
to
monitor
blood
pressure
a
stethoscope
and
other
examination
paraphernalia
if
you
kindly
take
a
seat
ellen
said
i
sure
he
be
here
as
soon
as
he
can
in
a
few
minutes
at
most
but
while
we
wait
i
need
to
take
your
temperature
and
blood
pressure
and
start
a
chart
ally
where
are
we
nina
asked
her
face
was
becoming
alarmed
and
maria
reached
to
comfort
her
are
we
in
a
hospital
somewhere
yes
mom
it
actually
the
institute
i
told
you
about
last
night
the
doctor
here
wants
to
see
if
he
can
do
anything
to
help
you
oh
she
said
is
he
the
one
you
told
me
about
i
thought
that
was
just
a
dream
no
he
real
whether
he
can
help
you
or
not
that
part
is
still
a
dream
but
we
all
praying
she
looked
around
at
the
pure
white
walls
and
wondered
again
what
she
was
getting
into
meeting
a
new
specialist
in
the
sterile
white
cold
of
an
examination
room
could
be
frightening
in
itself
god
how
many
times
before
had
she
done
this
as
she
trudged
through
hmo
hell
maria
was
so
unsettled
she
was
deathly
pale
ellen
took
their
blood
pressure
and
temperature
including
maria
even
though
she
protested
mildly
half
in
spanish
a
sign
of
how
unsettling
it
was
to
her
ellen
had
only
just
finished
putting
all
the
numbers
on
clipboard
charts
for
each
of
them
when
karl
van
de
vliet
opened
the
door
and
strode
in
chapter
april
had
a
high
forehead
and
prominent
cheekbones
just
like
in
the
photo
and
just
as
in
his
photo
there
was
a
genuine
dichotomy
between
his
face
which
looked
to
be
early
forties
and
unwrinkled
and
his
gray
eyes
which
were
much
older
that
was
it
that
was
what
seemed
odd
he
was
different
ages
underneath
his
white
lab
coat
he
was
wearing
a
black
suit
and
an
necked
blue
shirt
ally
noticed
that
his
fingers
were
long
and
delicate
like
those
of
a
concert
pianist
and
overall
he
had
a
kind
of
ghostly
presence
as
though
he
were
more
spirit
than
man
although
he
looked
exactly
as
he
did
in
the
photograph
in
the
gerex
corporation
brochure
in
person
there
was
an
added
dimension
a
kind
of
raw
magnetism
about
him
it
was
more
than
simply
a
physician
bedside
manner
it
was
the
allure
of
a
pied
piper
the
first
thing
you
wanted
to
ask
him
was
old
are
you
really
maybe
the
next
thing
want
to
do
was
ask
him
to
dinner
what
had
she
expected
maybe
a
nerd
researcher
in
wrinkled
stained
lab
attire
anxious
to
scurry
back
to
his
test
tubes
but
in
person
karl
van
de
vliet
was
debonair
and
youthful
living
proof
that
his
photo
was
retouched
and
was
recent
he
had
to
be
twenty
years
older
than
she
was
easily
but
to
look
at
him
you
guess
he
was
close
to
the
same
age
she
was
dying
to
ask
him
about
that
but
she
could
think
of
a
polite
way
to
raise
the
subject
she
introduced
herself
we
spoke
yesterday
then
she
introduced
her
mother
and
maria
mom
and
i
talked
last
night
about
the
clinical
trials
and
she
said
she
interested
this
morning
unfortunately
not
sure
she
remembers
what
we
discussed
he
placed
a
hand
on
nina
shoulder
and
studied
her
face
as
he
smiled
at
her
embracing
her
with
his
eyes
well
we
going
to
see
what
we
can
do
about
that
are
we
mrs
hampton
i
got
a
question
right
up
front
ally
said
have
we
already
been
entered
into
the
national
institutes
of
health
clinical
trials
he
seemed
taken
aback
for
a
moment
caught
off
guard
but
then
he
stepped
up
to
the
question
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
take
the
liberty
of
authorizing
the
preliminary
nih
paperwork
for
both
of
you
of
course
it
obligate
you
in
any
way
the
thing
is
there
a
lot
of
red
tape
so
if
you
do
decide
to
participate
the
sooner
we
get
that
part
started
the
better
on
the
other
hand
if
you
decide
not
to
we
can
just
terminate
everything
at
this
preliminary
stage
and
you
wo
even
be
part
of
the
official
record
well
ally
thought
that
undoubtedly
explains
why
stone
saw
our
names
on
the
nih
web
site
but
why
did
van
de
vliet
look
so
funny
when
i
brought
it
up
he
focused
on
nina
hampton
i
van
de
vliet
you
a
pretty
lady
and
we
had
some
luck
helping
other
ladies
like
you
honey
if
i
had
you
in
my
bedroom
then
maybe
you
could
help
me
oh
my
god
ally
thought
she
about
to
go
ribald
on
us
but
that
a
sign
she
coming
out
of
her
funk
but
then
she
had
another
thought
maybe
nina
sensed
he
was
older
than
he
looked
like
that
paranormal
perception
that
told
her
grant
was
involved
in
something
evil
so
far
however
that
particular
perception
had
panned
out
though
grant
clearly
was
up
to
something
maria
was
mortified
she
blushed
and
made
a
disapproving
animal
noise
low
in
her
throat
and
turned
her
face
away
but
van
de
vliet
simply
smiled
even
more
broadly
hampton
i
do
think
you
should
be
talking
that
way
in
front
of
your
daughter
he
gave
her
a
wink
what
you
and
i
do
together
is
none
of
these
people
business
but
i
do
think
we
should
consider
keeping
them
informed
if
only
a
couple
of
hints
ally
found
herself
wanting
just
to
listen
to
his
voice
there
was
an
intelligent
warmth
about
it
that
reminded
her
of
a
kindly
professor
at
columbia
a
truly
gifted
architect
who
also
could
quote
keats
and
make
you
cry
you
wanted
to
give
yourself
to
him
my
god
she
thought
how
am
i
going
to
stand
up
to
this
man
there
some
issues
you
and
i
need
to
discuss
he
said
turning
back
to
ally
the
first
thing
i
need
to
do
is
take
a
look
at
records
but
whatever
they
say
it
wo
do
any
harm
to
run
what
we
call
a
state
examination
for
her
to
establish
a
general
baseline
of
cognitive
impairment
as
of
now
how
long
will
that
take
actually
ellen
can
start
in
just
a
few
minutes
he
said
of
course
we
need
to
hear
about
the
usual
danger
signs
everybody
knows
does
hampton
have
loss
does
she
get
confused
about
places
and
people
does
she
have
trouble
handling
money
and
paying
her
bills
the
short
answer
is
yes
all
of
those
things
ally
knew
had
accelerated
in
the
last
six
months
it
was
the
tragic
recognizable
onset
of
the
latter
stages
of
alzheimer
already
more
than
once
maria
had
said
there
were
times
when
she
did
think
nina
recognized
her
more
and
more
she
seemed
to
be
confused
unable
some
days
to
find
her
way
around
the
apartment
and
she
started
repeating
herself
she
often
had
trouble
finding
the
right
words
and
she
was
increasingly
paranoid
and
suspicious
maria
who
had
worked
with
other
alzheimer
patients
feared
she
might
begin
hallucinating
soon
seeing
things
that
were
there
ally
turned
to
her
it
felt
obscene
to
talk
about
her
when
she
was
sitting
right
there
with
them
mom
sweetie
do
you
understand
what
van
de
vliet
is
asking
do
you
think
you
have
trouble
doing
everyday
things
she
knew
the
answer
but
she
was
determined
that
her
mother
not
be
treated
like
a
potted
plant
ally
you
know
that
half
the
time
i
ca
remember
a
blessed
thing
i
getting
crazy
as
a
bloody
coot
then
nina
turned
and
looked
van
de
vliet
in
the
eye
i
do
want
to
lose
my
mind
doctor
i
do
want
to
see
the
shade
closing
in
i
ca
do
crosswords
anymore
i
used
to
do
them
all
the
time
and
all
the
music
i
used
to
know
it
was
my
love
and
now
now
i
ca
tell
scriabin
from
strauss
half
the
time
it
supposed
to
happen
that
way
i
thought
my
mind
would
go
on
forever
hampton
if
you
let
me
what
i
want
to
do
is
try
to
work
on
your
recollection
i
do
know
how
much
i
can
help
you
with
crosswords
but
then
i
never
been
much
good
at
them
myself
either
your
memory
of
music
should
improve
though
there
are
no
guarantees
but
then
i
ready
to
try
it
doctor
she
cut
in
you
all
that
stands
between
me
and
losing
the
only
thing
i
have
left
my
past
next
came
a
burst
of
rationality
now
i
hate
to
be
a
pest
but
could
you
explain
what
exactly
it
is
you
going
to
do
i
want
ally
to
hear
this
too
and
then
maybe
she
can
go
over
it
with
me
later
and
help
me
understand
it
he
smiled
and
reached
over
and
stroked
her
slightly
thinning
hair
be
happy
to
try
hampton
it
actually
pretty
simple
then
he
turned
to
ally
we
touched
on
some
of
this
on
the
phone
do
you
want
to
hear
it
again
yes
i
still
trying
to
get
it
all
into
my
simple
mind
well
he
began
to
go
back
to
the
very
beginning
of
my
interest
in
stem
cells
the
focus
of
our
research
has
been
directed
toward
challenging
the
notorious
hayflick
limit
back
in
the
professor
leonard
hayflick
discovered
that
when
tissue
cells
are
taken
from
the
body
and
cultured
in
a
laboratory
dish
those
cells
grow
and
divide
about
fifty
times
give
or
take
and
then
they
stop
they
have
reached
old
age
senescence
the
physical
basis
of
the
hayflick
limit
is
a
section
of
dna
known
as
telomere
which
gets
shorter
each
time
the
cell
divides
eventually
the
telomeres
become
so
short
that
all
cell
division
stops
it
like
an
internal
clock
telling
them
the
game
is
over
they
had
their
innings
and
you
saying
you
found
a
way
to
beat
the
clock
to
stop
the
telomeres
from
getting
shorter
all
cells
possess
a
gene
known
as
the
telomerase
gene
which
can
restore
the
telomeres
to
their
youthful
length
but
in
most
cells
the
gene
is
permanently
repressed
and
inactive
it
is
only
found
in
egg
and
sperm
cells
and
in
cancer
cells
he
gazed
away
for
a
moment
as
though
collecting
his
thoughts
then
he
turned
back
however
we
found
that
by
isolating
and
inserting
an
active
copy
of
the
telomerase
enzyme
into
adult
stem
cells
which
can
be
found
in
minute
quantities
throughout
the
body
we
can
set
their
clock
back
to
zero
we
extract
cells
them
with
telomerase
and
then
return
them
to
the
body
as
a
youthful
infusion
and
is
that
what
you
be
doing
for
mom
there
be
a
series
of
injections
but
given
what
appears
to
be
her
level
of
mental
awareness
right
now
the
procedure
probably
can
be
accelerated
he
patted
nina
on
the
shoulder
all
right
ally
said
but
can
you
use
the
same
procedure
for
someone
heart
well
yes
and
no
he
said
did
you
bring
your
medical
records
i
should
have
a
look
at
them
before
making
any
pronouncements
to
prepare
for
this
moment
she
printed
off
a
copy
of
the
medical
files
she
scanned
into
her
computer
there
a
lot
of
files
she
said
opening
her
bag
i
got
copies
of
my
ekgs
over
the
past
eleven
years
ekelman
my
cardiologist
says
my
condition
is
getting
progressively
worse
she
took
the
folder
out
of
her
bag
and
handed
it
to
him
he
flipped
through
the
files
with
what
seemed
an
absent
manner
almost
as
though
he
already
knew
what
was
in
them
and
was
just
going
through
the
motions
then
he
looked
up
well
your
physical
condition
looks
pretty
good
you
clearly
exercise
and
i
do
see
anything
here
that
would
suggest
a
complication
as
to
how
your
procedure
might
differ
from
your
mother
i
guess
the
main
area
of
concern
is
simply
the
scale
he
laid
her
files
on
the
steel
table
your
heart
has
reached
the
stage
of
aortic
valve
stenosis
where
cardiac
output
no
longer
can
keep
up
proportionately
with
vigorous
exercise
and
that
has
put
an
even
larger
strain
on
an
already
weakened
condition
what
we
are
about
to
undertake
here
corresponds
to
what
might
almost
be
considered
an
aortic
valve
replacement
though
it
is
done
at
the
cellular
level
we
call
it
regenerative
medicine
millions
of
cells
will
be
involved
we
attempt
to
reverse
the
calcification
and
also
to
develop
new
blood
vessels
that
supply
the
heart
muscle
you
know
this
is
so
risky
i
remember
that
not
long
ago
they
tried
to
use
fetal
cell
injections
into
the
brain
for
treating
disease
and
it
turned
out
that
the
side
effects
were
horrendous
why
should
i
assume
that
this
is
any
safer
he
looked
pained
i
assure
you
we
do
do
anything
here
that
is
remotely
like
that
particular
unfortunate
procedure
she
stared
at
the
ceiling
trying
to
grasp
what
he
just
said
so
how
risky
do
you
think
this
is
she
asked
finally
truth
time
he
looked
away
again
and
sighed
there
was
a
long
silence
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
pondering
some
extremely
troubling
thoughts
finally
he
turned
back
in
medicine
there
is
always
something
that
can
go
wrong
even
the
most
innocuous
procedure
can
end
up
being
lethal
if
that
what
the
gods
want
that
day
he
looked
at
her
intently
and
seemed
to
try
to
measure
his
words
but
i
would
recommend
we
proceed
if
i
did
feel
that
the
potential
benefits
far
outweigh
the
risks
she
listened
wondering
something
in
his
voice
is
sounding
cagey
what
is
he
leaving
out
i
still
want
to
think
about
it
of
course
but
we
can
make
some
preparations
in
the
meantime
van
de
vliet
said
turning
back
to
nina
hampton
do
you
understand
anything
of
what
i
said
nothing
is
risk
free
young
man
if
you
lived
as
long
as
i
have
and
then
felt
it
all
slipping
away
you
be
willing
to
take
a
chance
with
anything
hampton
alzheimer
is
one
of
the
more
promising
areas
of
stem
cell
research
we
already
had
successes
here
i
truly
think
we
can
help
you
in
fact
ellen
can
start
your
preliminaries
right
now
if
you
like
a
lot
of
it
you
may
have
done
before
for
example
there
a
game
where
you
have
to
memorize
the
names
of
three
unrelated
objects
and
you
have
to
count
backwards
from
one
hundred
by
sevens
finally
a
test
where
you
copy
sentences
and
symbols
he
chuckled
and
there
was
a
warmth
but
also
a
distant
sadness
some
days
i
not
sure
i
could
even
do
it
all
myself
in
any
case
it
not
something
you
pass
or
fail
but
if
we
do
enter
you
into
the
trials
you
have
to
stay
here
for
the
duration
that
absolutely
essential
we
also
like
a
caregiver
to
be
here
with
you
as
long
as
it
necessary
ally
looked
at
maria
do
you
think
you
want
to
stay
here
with
mom
maria
eyes
were
very
sad
i
could
stay
for
a
day
or
two
but
maybe
we
should
talk
we
can
arrange
for
someone
van
de
vliet
interjected
we
routinely
provide
caregivers
from
our
staff
when
called
for
and
because
still
in
clinical
trials
there
is
no
charge
ally
watched
nina
brighten
and
turn
to
maria
you
can
bring
some
things
from
my
closet
when
you
go
back
i
want
to
start
right
away
i
just
know
he
can
help
me
i
got
a
feeling
and
you
know
my
feelings
are
always
right
ellen
reached
and
took
nina
hand
come
dear
we
have
a
special
office
where
we
handle
all
the
paperwork
for
admissions
we
can
do
the
tests
there
ally
leaned
over
and
kissed
her
mother
i
love
you
mom
and
i
love
your
spirit
you
taught
me
how
to
be
a
fighter
a
long
time
ago
and
i
guess
you
still
teaching
me
tuesday
april
karl
van
de
vliet
watched
the
three
women
leave
now
he
was
alone
with
alexa
so
far
so
good
he
thought
with
her
mother
checked
in
partway
there
now
what
is
it
going
to
take
to
get
her
with
the
program
i
not
sensing
commitment
she
asking
too
damned
many
questions
it
looks
like
we
may
have
to
go
to
plan
b
tomorrow
too
bad
after
the
door
was
closed
he
turned
back
your
mother
is
quite
an
inspiration
he
said
with
a
smile
i
need
those
tests
to
create
a
baseline
but
already
i
can
tell
she
almost
certainly
respond
to
the
treatment
she
fits
our
success
profile
say
the
odds
are
heavily
on
her
side
then
he
darkened
his
look
for
effect
better
let
her
know
i
do
have
to
do
this
he
reasoned
the
truth
is
we
already
have
enough
data
on
alzheimers
that
i
really
need
any
further
clinical
trials
i
know
the
parameters
of
what
the
procedure
can
do
and
what
it
ca
but
when
grant
told
me
about
his
mother
condition
i
saw
no
reason
not
to
work
her
into
the
trials
we
winding
down
now
and
we
have
some
empty
beds
do
think
i
not
grateful
she
said
even
though
i
may
ask
a
lot
of
questions
she
got
the
message
he
thought
good
alexa
i
now
going
to
tell
you
something
i
never
told
anyone
else
he
went
on
feeling
a
tinge
of
sadness
arise
in
his
chest
he
had
planned
to
say
this
but
for
some
reason
he
now
wanted
to
perhaps
because
it
was
true
my
late
wife
camille
was
a
brilliant
medical
researcher
we
worked
together
for
many
years
first
at
johns
hopkins
and
then
at
harvard
what
took
her
from
me
was
a
heart
condition
very
similar
to
your
own
that
was
over
a
decade
ago
and
i
vowed
i
would
dedicate
my
work
to
her
i
wanted
the
final
clinical
trial
in
this
program
to
be
on
a
young
person
with
advanced
valvular
stenosis
but
i
could
never
find
a
patient
who
matched
that
profile
but
you
would
be
perfect
he
looked
carefully
at
her
it
was
all
so
true
which
made
this
whole
scene
especially
poignant
i
sorry
about
your
wife
ally
said
i
read
in
your
you
see
if
i
can
succeed
with
you
it
would
almost
seem
as
though
had
a
second
chance
to
save
her
life
you
bear
such
a
striking
likeness
to
her
in
several
ways
you
look
something
like
her
but
more
importantly
i
sense
that
you
share
her
indomitable
will
so
i
not
just
another
statistic
to
you
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
gauge
the
depth
of
his
sincerity
no
one
here
is
a
statistic
but
you
would
definitely
be
someone
special
i
see
she
said
still
sounding
noncommittal
am
i
getting
anywhere
he
wondered
just
press
on
you
got
to
make
this
happen
all
right
whatever
you
decide
we
need
to
get
some
preliminaries
out
of
the
way
for
one
thing
we
must
have
a
complete
new
cardiology
exam
nothing
in
the
file
you
brought
presents
an
obvious
red
flag
but
still
it
essential
that
we
have
an
stress
test
toward
that
end
i
taken
the
liberty
of
arranging
for
a
checkup
at
the
new
york
university
faculty
practice
radiology
on
east
fourth
street
among
other
things
they
can
run
a
computed
tomography
screening
using
ultrafast
x
rays
also
i
like
to
see
a
phonocardiogram
a
sonic
analysis
of
can
tell
us
a
lot
about
valve
abnormalities
regardless
of
what
you
decide
to
do
here
it
a
good
idea
for
you
to
have
this
done
regularly
anyway
you
already
scheduled
tests
her
tone
of
voice
told
him
she
was
mildly
taken
aback
at
the
presumption
it
just
that
the
nyu
faculty
practice
is
sometimes
difficult
to
get
into
on
short
notice
they
can
be
booked
for
weeks
in
advance
but
a
cardiologist
i
know
there
lev
amram
has
agreed
to
make
room
for
you
this
afternoon
it
a
professional
courtesy
there
be
no
charge
after
that
and
assuming
you
want
to
proceed
you
should
get
a
good
night
rest
and
then
come
back
here
as
early
as
possible
tomorrow
morning
you
should
pack
for
a
stay
though
we
provide
you
with
pretty
much
everything
you
need
here
just
get
her
here
you
know
she
said
i
was
actually
hoping
we
could
do
this
on
an
outpatient
basis
i
know
you
like
to
have
your
patients
here
for
constant
observation
but
i
run
a
business
that
needs
me
there
every
day
alexa
he
said
putting
every
last
ounce
of
authority
he
had
into
his
voice
this
is
not
a
conventional
procedure
and
it
possible
you
might
suddenly
need
special
care
of
some
kind
this
is
an
experimental
clinical
trial
so
we
do
know
what
can
happen
that
why
i
really
must
insist
that
you
be
here
hours
a
day
he
looked
at
her
with
great
tenderness
we
talking
about
the
possibility
of
completely
repairing
your
heart
surely
you
do
expect
just
to
drop
by
now
and
then
for
that
all
right
point
taken
she
said
but
if
we
go
forward
with
this
i
need
to
hire
at
least
one
temp
to
be
at
the
office
while
i
gone
somebody
to
at
least
handle
the
phone
that
could
take
time
surely
someone
there
could
manage
to
handle
that
he
said
getting
resistant
again
he
told
himself
do
let
that
happen
and
there
also
the
matter
of
your
mother
i
think
it
would
be
wise
for
you
to
be
nearby
during
the
early
stages
of
her
procedure
when
her
mind
starts
climbing
out
of
the
abyss
it
important
for
a
close
family
member
to
be
there
to
provide
a
visual
and
emotional
anchor
it
truly
can
make
all
the
difference
i
fully
expect
that
her
functions
of
attention
and
recall
will
return
to
those
normal
for
a
woman
her
age
or
quite
possibly
even
better
but
it
will
happen
a
lot
quicker
if
you
here
to
help
her
to
remind
her
of
things
this
is
a
lot
to
digest
ally
turned
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
all
right
i
might
as
well
get
the
exam
it
does
mean
i
agreed
to
anything
here
he
heard
the
ambivalence
and
knew
he
had
no
choice
but
to
do
what
he
was
going
to
have
to
do
tomorrow
i
will
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
you
be
entering
the
program
truthfully
if
you
do
a
week
from
now
your
mother
is
going
to
be
asking
you
why
he
smiled
in
any
case
we
need
to
have
those
tests
done
in
the
city
also
some
blood
work
here
we
affiliated
with
a
lab
i
want
to
check
your
and
certain
other
markers
like
reactive
protein
and
homocystine
it
something
you
should
do
regularly
anyway
all
right
then
she
said
finally
but
after
that
let
me
go
see
how
mom
doing
then
i
arrange
things
with
maria
somehow
and
drive
back
to
the
city
by
the
way
before
i
forget
we
have
to
complete
a
formal
application
for
your
mother
to
admit
her
into
the
clinical
trials
and
we
also
need
a
signed
liability
waiver
i
assume
you
have
power
of
attorney
for
her
by
now
if
you
do
then
we
may
not
legally
be
able
to
proceed
i
have
it
then
let
get
started
he
declared
almost
certain
he
had
her
chapter
april
aimes
was
in
his
cubicle
staring
at
the
phone
when
it
rang
he
prayed
this
was
the
call
he
been
waiting
for
as
a
gamble
a
long
shot
he
requested
that
jane
tully
his
former
lover
and
the
sentinel
corporate
counsel
do
him
a
small
favor
after
he
hacked
the
nih
web
site
he
asked
her
to
pass
along
just
one
question
concerning
gerex
to
winston
bartlett
corporate
attorneys
why
had
a
patient
been
abruptly
and
mysteriously
terminated
without
explanation
from
the
clinical
trials
now
under
way
by
the
gerex
corporation
if
that
would
get
a
rise
out
of
bartlett
he
did
know
what
would
it
was
the
only
part
of
the
corporation
encrypted
nih
file
that
seemed
irregular
but
would
bartlett
take
the
bait
he
reached
for
the
phone
aimes
here
around
him
came
the
clatter
of
computer
keys
and
muted
laughter
from
the
direction
of
the
water
cooler
everybody
had
watched
a
tivo
of
the
latest
sunday
night
and
they
were
still
critiquing
the
shows
mondays
were
everybody
day
off
so
tuesdays
were
the
first
chance
to
catch
up
the
staff
was
also
starting
to
rev
up
again
for
the
coming
week
edition
everybody
with
the
hope
that
their
particular
assignment
would
have
legs
and
make
its
author
a
household
name
stone
however
felt
like
this
was
either
the
first
day
of
the
rest
of
his
life
or
the
last
day
of
a
career
built
on
dealing
to
inside
straights
this
can
not
go
on
much
longer
he
kept
telling
himself
it
was
an
unstable
condition
his
soul
was
already
over
the
fence
keeping
company
with
that
wild
free
ox
he
liked
to
muse
about
stone
came
a
husky
female
voice
strained
and
yet
strong
just
as
he
hoped
it
was
jane
whose
office
was
down
on
the
third
floor
can
you
come
down
right
now
did
you
hear
back
from
stone
she
admonished
her
voice
growing
urgent
just
come
down
do
it
now
all
right
sure
he
paused
a
moment
wondering
why
did
she
sound
so
upset
had
his
plan
somehow
backfired
i
on
my
way
he
glanced
up
at
the
fluorescent
light
over
his
head
like
a
pitiless
hovering
spaceship
and
wondered
if
this
was
going
to
be
the
break
he
had
been
praying
for
there
was
a
nervousness
in
jane
voice
that
indicated
something
major
was
afoot
something
was
about
to
change
he
switched
off
his
compaq
laptop
and
reached
for
his
brown
corduroy
jacket
which
was
hanging
from
a
hook
on
the
side
of
the
cubicle
he
straightened
his
brown
knit
tie
as
he
stepped
on
the
elevator
and
for
some
reason
he
found
himself
thinking
of
his
daughter
amy
he
mimed
a
toast
here
looking
at
you
kid
she
was
in
the
fifth
grade
and
lived
with
her
mother
joyce
in
a
small
condominium
nestled
in
the
hills
near
el
cerrito
where
his
grew
up
joyce
was
a
television
producer
who
had
left
him
to
go
back
out
there
where
she
got
work
as
a
garden
designer
when
he
got
over
the
shock
he
finally
concluded
she
loved
california
more
than
she
loved
him
maybe
not
an
unreasonable
choice
but
then
she
got
custody
of
amy
based
solely
on
the
fact
that
his
income
was
inadequate
to
send
her
to
private
school
in
new
york
and
the
public
schools
were
out
of
the
question
but
joyce
had
agreed
that
if
he
ever
had
the
money
she
could
live
with
him
some
of
the
time
this
book
he
hoped
would
make
that
happen
he
still
did
know
why
he
and
joyce
could
have
made
a
go
of
it
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
the
real
possibility
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
idea
of
a
dashing
investigative
reporter
not
the
grueling
reality
these
days
she
had
amy
all
the
time
except
for
three
weeks
in
july
and
he
had
so
many
things
to
regret
he
scarcely
knew
where
to
start
he
kept
a
photograph
of
amy
on
his
desk
in
a
frame
far
too
expensive
for
a
snapshot
of
a
young
girl
on
a
black
horse
named
zena
but
it
was
zena
that
his
a
month
in
child
support
had
helped
to
pay
for
and
he
felt
it
somehow
bonded
them
hi
dad
from
me
and
zena
went
the
inscription
why
was
he
thinking
about
her
now
he
wondered
the
answer
was
because
he
wanted
her
world
to
be
different
from
the
one
he
had
known
as
a
child
he
had
had
a
father
around
and
that
had
left
him
with
a
lot
of
anger
he
did
want
the
same
fate
for
her
amy
world
he
knew
was
going
to
be
very
different
no
matter
what
he
did
to
be
young
like
her
and
starting
out
was
a
daunting
prospect
these
days
he
wanted
to
make
everything
easier
for
her
but
the
only
thing
he
could
give
her
now
was
a
measly
every
month
and
his
unshakable
love
even
so
that
was
more
than
his
mother
karen
got
for
child
support
from
a
natural
father
he
had
never
actually
seen
in
the
flesh
until
he
was
eleven
and
that
was
a
chance
encounter
so
if
this
book
got
some
traction
and
he
got
some
recognition
along
with
some
economic
security
he
might
be
able
to
have
amy
come
back
and
live
with
him
it
was
something
she
said
she
wanted
to
do
though
he
was
sure
where
he
would
keep
zena
but
all
in
good
time
now
everything
depended
on
the
book
the
elevator
door
opened
and
he
stepped
out
on
the
third
floor
the
receptionist
rhonda
a
resident
of
avenue
a
who
usually
tried
to
flirt
looked
at
him
as
though
he
just
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
nodded
with
her
head
toward
the
corridor
leading
to
office
stone
you
really
screwed
up
this
time
you
never
guess
who
in
there
and
after
your
scalp
what
on
earth
did
you
do
you
mean
this
is
a
guy
i
only
seen
in
newspaper
pictures
though
needless
to
say
not
in
this
upstanding
rag
in
her
dismay
she
unthinkingly
reached
for
the
pack
of
virginia
slims
lying
next
to
the
phone
momentarily
forgetting
that
smoking
had
been
forbidden
in
the
building
you
better
get
your
ass
in
there
jesus
he
came
in
with
a
bunch
of
lawyers
but
then
he
told
them
to
split
going
to
handle
the
fucker
myself
quote
unquote
right
here
by
my
desk
stone
did
know
with
absolute
certainty
who
she
was
talking
about
but
surely
it
had
to
be
my
god
he
thought
with
a
thrill
maybe
it
worked
maybe
i
smoked
him
out
truth
tellers
have
nothing
to
fear
rhonda
he
winked
at
her
protected
by
the
sword
of
the
lord
is
my
rod
and
my
staff
he
leadeth
me
beside
still
waters
you
crazy
you
know
that
she
remembered
where
she
was
and
began
putting
the
cigarette
back
into
the
pack
then
she
smoothed
her
short
black
hair
he
leadeth
you
into
the
shit
handsome
that
where
he
you
you
adorable
but
you
also
a
sane
nightmare
thanks
he
said
giving
a
as
he
walked
past
her
desk
i
appreciate
your
unstinting
praise
he
headed
on
down
the
hall
the
plush
gray
carpet
soft
against
his
feet
could
this
be
the
break
he
wondered
feeling
his
hopes
cautiously
rising
had
the
big
man
himself
shown
up
could
it
be
that
there
was
something
funny
going
on
with
that
patient
who
got
dropped
but
what
he
still
did
have
a
clue
as
he
walked
into
the
room
he
felt
as
though
time
just
stopped
he
had
fantasized
about
this
moment
more
and
more
as
the
years
went
by
now
here
it
was
what
next
he
thought
he
had
been
emotionally
prepared
but
now
he
realized
he
was
were
they
going
to
acknowledge
the
past
or
were
they
just
going
to
act
as
though
nothing
existed
between
them
that
first
chance
meeting
when
stone
was
eleven
had
been
when
his
mother
threatened
to
sue
bartlett
for
formal
child
support
the
threat
of
publicity
caused
the
matter
to
be
immediately
settled
as
hoped
it
would
be
stone
had
been
sitting
in
the
law
firm
reception
area
when
bartlett
walked
through
each
knew
who
the
other
was
but
bartlett
just
stopped
and
glared
at
him
for
a
moment
before
moving
cm
stone
had
sized
up
the
man
who
had
abandoned
his
mother
and
only
barely
managed
to
suppress
an
urge
to
leap
up
and
lash
out
at
him
if
only
to
say
look
at
me
i
here
he
had
not
been
in
the
same
room
with
his
father
since
but
this
time
around
he
was
definitely
noticed
winston
bartlett
looked
just
as
he
did
in
news
photos
he
was
in
his
late
sixties
with
thinning
blond
hair
that
was
cut
too
long
and
shaggy
in
the
back
stone
first
thought
was
that
the
tightfisted
old
should
spring
for
a
better
barber
but
it
was
bartlett
eyes
that
really
caught
him
they
were
strong
and
filled
with
anger
but
they
also
contained
a
hint
of
desperation
they
were
very
different
eyes
from
the
haughty
dismissal
he
remembered
from
a
lifetime
ago
good
stone
thought
i
finally
made
you
squirm
daddy
dearest
nothing
else
i
done
has
ever
gotten
the
slightest
notice
from
you
for
a
moment
they
stood
sizing
up
each
other
stone
jane
said
this
is
i
know
he
said
even
though
they
had
been
practically
married
he
had
never
told
her
that
he
was
the
unacknowledged
son
of
winston
bartlett
he
had
never
told
anyone
to
him
his
father
had
died
before
he
was
born
and
that
was
the
story
he
stuck
to
he
naturally
had
a
lot
of
complex
feelings
about
that
he
had
seen
his
mother
struggling
to
give
them
a
decent
life
hoofing
in
the
chorus
line
of
broadway
shows
long
after
she
should
have
and
a
lot
of
his
anger
remained
now
though
stone
aimes
wanted
nothing
from
the
old
man
except
the
truth
miss
tully
bartlett
barked
glowering
at
her
i
think
you
better
leave
us
alone
of
course
jane
said
with
a
wry
look
and
in
a
tactful
instant
she
had
slipped
past
them
and
out
gently
closing
the
office
door
behind
her
i
do
believe
it
bartlett
said
turning
back
after
he
watched
her
leave
you
trying
to
blackmail
me
you
little
prick
which
tells
me
you
not
half
as
smart
as
i
thought
you
were
wait
a
minute
did
that
mean
winston
bartlett
has
been
following
my
career
stone
felt
a
thrill
in
spite
of
himself
i
never
knew
you
thought
about
me
one
way
or
the
other
he
was
experiencing
a
curious
sensation
although
he
was
in
the
same
room
with
his
father
for
only
the
second
time
in
his
life
it
felt
natural
they
were
having
one
of
those
arguments
the
younger
generation
had
just
challenged
the
older
generation
and
because
of
that
sparks
were
set
to
fly
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
supposed
to
happen
between
fathers
and
sons
all
the
time
in
fact
it
felt
good
it
felt
normal
more
than
that
he
was
finally
being
acknowledged
my
god
he
thought
i
share
dna
with
this
man
and
yet
we
have
so
little
in
common
then
he
had
a
more
scary
thought
maybe
we
have
a
lot
in
common
i
think
it
time
you
told
me
what
the
hell
you
up
to
bartlett
declared
ignoring
the
jibe
how
did
you
i
trying
to
do
us
both
a
favor
but
you
not
cooperating
if
the
gerex
clinical
trials
are
going
half
as
well
as
i
think
they
are
then
it
seems
to
me
you
got
everything
to
gain
by
publicity
i
trying
to
write
the
first
book
that
tells
the
gerex
story
so
why
the
hell
wo
your
legal
flunkies
let
me
interview
karl
van
de
vliet
that
actually
none
of
your
business
bartlett
eyes
abruptly
turned
cloudy
i
want
you
to
stay
the
hell
away
from
right
now
i
the
best
friend
you
got
in
this
world
believe
me
stone
could
believe
he
was
saying
this
for
how
many
years
had
he
loathed
and
despised
this
man
but
now
for
the
first
time
he
actually
needed
something
from
him
i
want
to
tell
the
real
story
of
what
van
de
vliet
has
accomplished
what
gerex
has
accomplished
it
be
the
latest
word
on
stem
cell
technology
but
your
office
keeps
giving
me
the
runaround
we
have
a
damned
good
reason
to
keep
our
work
proprietary
just
now
bartlett
declared
this
is
like
the
manhattan
project
his
eyes
bored
in
the
results
of
the
clinical
trials
are
going
to
cause
a
press
feeding
frenzy
and
i
want
to
be
in
a
position
to
control
that
when
the
time
comes
this
is
incredible
stone
told
himself
we
talking
as
though
we
have
no
history
you
have
a
granddaughter
by
me
whom
you
never
even
seen
do
you
at
least
care
about
her
i
got
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
gerex
is
doing
and
i
think
going
to
be
a
milestone
in
medical
history
stone
looked
at
him
trying
to
figure
him
out
after
all
these
years
for
all
his
bluster
winston
bartlett
seemed
like
a
man
with
a
lot
of
vulnerabilities
and
insecurities
he
had
expected
it
it
so
happens
i
a
damned
good
medical
reporter
and
all
i
asking
is
to
be
the
boswell
to
van
de
vliet
johnson
i
want
to
be
the
one
to
chronicle
this
historic
moment
there
no
one
who
can
do
it
better
believe
me
ill
even
agree
to
embargo
everything
until
i
get
a
green
light
from
gerex
but
i
want
to
start
now
and
get
it
right
you
ca
ethically
know
any
details
of
the
work
bartlett
declared
so
the
question
i
waiting
to
hear
answered
is
how
did
you
find
i
ca
reveal
my
source
because
he
told
himself
i
still
have
one
all
have
is
guesswork
but
i
know
that
karl
van
de
vliet
is
running
the
first
successful
clinical
trials
using
stem
cell
procedures
and
i
going
to
report
on
it
whether
you
want
me
to
or
not
so
are
you
going
to
help
make
sure
my
facts
are
accurate
i
going
to
help
make
sure
there
no
reporting
at
all
till
i
say
so
bartlett
went
on
anything
you
print
will
be
by
definition
irresponsible
speculation
and
you
can
expect
enough
legal
action
to
the
original
schedule
was
that
they
be
finished
in
less
than
a
month
i
not
going
to
publish
anything
before
that
i
just
want
to
have
the
manuscript
i
been
working
on
ready
when
the
gerex
story
finally
can
be
told
it
be
the
final
chapter
the
payoff
i
going
to
describe
your
clinical
trials
and
it
would
be
better
for
all
concerned
if
it
could
be
the
version
if
you
force
me
to
publish
without
your
cooperation
it
not
going
to
do
either
one
of
us
as
much
good
again
he
wondered
why
bartlett
was
so
upset
what
was
it
about
that
one
terminated
patient
that
made
him
freak
when
he
found
out
somebody
knew
so
freaked
he
charged
up
here
personally
all
the
way
from
his
fancy
corporate
building
in
tribeca
to
breathe
fire
and
brimstone
and
yell
threats
do
i
have
to
get
a
court
injunction
to
put
a
stop
to
this
corporate
espionage
bartlett
demanded
everything
i
know
is
in
the
public
domain
somewhere
actually
stone
thought
that
a
serious
lie
nobody
knows
that
a
patient
got
mysteriously
terminated
from
the
trials
i
just
want
to
work
together
with
you
even
as
he
was
saying
it
stone
aimes
realized
that
it
was
not
in
the
cards
now
or
ever
he
watched
winston
bartlett
eyes
narrow
what
kind
of
contract
do
you
have
with
this
paper
quite
frankly
the
terms
of
the
contracts
for
employees
of
this
paper
are
confidential
i
knew
i
should
have
kept
those
fucking
lawyers
here
it
takes
a
shark
to
deal
with
a
shark
then
he
seemed
to
catch
himself
so
if
planning
on
writing
anything
about
this
you
be
well
advised
to
get
yourself
an
attorney
because
you
sure
as
hell
going
to
need
one
thanks
dad
it
just
came
out
maybe
he
been
wanting
to
say
it
all
his
life
bartlett
look
was
shock
for
a
moment
and
then
it
turned
pensive
you
do
think
i
take
an
interest
in
you
but
i
do
yeah
you
really
been
around
through
thick
and
thin
he
felt
the
old
anger
of
abandonment
welling
up
i
took
care
of
your
mother
whatever
she
did
was
beyond
my
control
the
eyes
were
switching
to
chagrin
do
you
have
the
slightest
idea
what
i
could
do
for
you
i
i
not
getting
any
younger
and
i
been
thinking
about
with
your
medical
background
you
could
easily
have
a
place
i
mean
if
you
got
a
head
for
business
then
someday
so
why
do
you
fucking
want
to
do
this
now
stone
listened
trying
to
internalize
what
he
was
hearing
not
only
did
winston
bartlett
know
about
him
he
was
finally
thinking
about
acknowledging
him
sort
of
or
was
this
just
a
bribe
to
hush
him
up
either
way
it
was
too
little
too
late
you
never
given
me
anything
and
i
sure
as
hell
never
asked
just
like
for
you
to
get
out
of
my
way
so
i
can
do
my
job
bartlett
stalked
toward
the
door
then
he
turned
back
you
better
think
long
and
hard
about
what
you
getting
into
you
can
ask
some
of
the
reporters
i
dealt
with
in
the
past
they
fucking
roadkill
with
that
pronouncement
he
slammed
the
door
and
was
gone
stone
stared
after
him
feeling
his
heart
pump
it
was
the
threat
it
was
the
mixed
emotions
for
a
moment
in
spite
of
his
better
judgment
he
felt
like
he
had
a
father
but
then
bartlett
became
the
enemy
again
then
the
door
cracked
open
and
jane
appeared
dismay
in
her
eyes
what
was
what
was
i
got
ta
tell
you
that
man
does
know
how
to
keep
his
voice
down
what
was
that
about
helping
your
mother
karen
you
never
talked
about
her
much
but
i
sure
do
remember
you
ever
saying
anything
about
her
and
winston
bartlett
that
because
i
did
jane
there
are
parts
of
my
past
life
that
i
try
not
to
think
about
any
more
than
i
have
to
after
the
fact
it
nice
to
know
that
there
were
parts
of
your
life
that
you
did
see
fit
to
share
with
me
she
sniffed
maybe
someday
it
a
little
late
for
that
she
declared
hurt
lingering
in
her
voice
look
stone
i
do
know
what
you
know
that
got
bartlett
so
upset
but
he
not
the
best
guy
in
the
world
to
piss
off
he
stormed
in
here
fit
to
be
tied
personally
demanding
to
know
how
the
hell
did
you
have
proprietary
information
about
the
gerex
corporation
clinical
trials
he
already
seemed
to
know
who
you
were
now
i
realize
more
to
the
story
somewhere
back
there
in
time
and
what
did
you
tell
him
i
was
completely
blindsided
for
which
i
thank
you
i
told
him
i
know
anything
about
your
sources
but
i
would
reveal
them
even
if
i
did
he
our
landlord
but
that
does
give
him
subpoena
power
he
does
have
the
right
to
barge
in
here
and
try
to
intimidate
the
sentinel
staff
we
current
on
the
rent
stone
felt
a
tinge
of
nostalgia
sometimes
her
bitchiness
was
the
very
thing
he
admired
most
about
her
well
thanks
for
sticking
up
for
me
maybe
i
got
him
upset
enough
that
he
come
around
eventually
and
decide
it
better
to
have
me
inside
the
tent
where
i
can
be
monitored
she
snorted
at
the
improbability
of
that
no
stone
as
usual
you
an
idiot
idealist
and
dreamer
i
tell
you
exactly
what
going
to
happen
bartlett
is
most
likely
on
his
cell
phone
right
now
as
we
speak
threatening
the
family
trying
to
get
you
fired
he
saying
you
stealing
proprietary
information
somehow
and
he
going
to
sue
the
sentinel
for
our
last
dime
if
we
print
a
syllable
of
anything
you
write
about
him
that
his
next
move
stone
i
expect
my
phone
to
ring
in
approximately
fourteen
and
a
half
minutes
their
attorneys
are
going
to
tell
me
to
tell
jay
to
get
you
under
control
that
what
going
to
happen
the
family
does
not
want
winston
bartlett
pissed
off
especially
by
the
likes
of
you
somebody
always
writing
muckraking
articles
that
make
them
real
nervous
does
anything
i
said
have
the
ring
of
logic
to
you
or
are
you
living
in
some
land
where
the
facts
do
fucking
penetrate
hey
he
thought
that
pretty
good
jane
is
in
defcon
mode
today
depends
on
what
you
look
at
the
doughnut
or
the
hole
that
is
the
stick
approach
or
the
carrot
i
betting
he
going
to
split
the
difference
and
try
a
little
of
both
he
going
to
cool
off
and
then
offer
me
a
few
crumbs
as
an
inducement
to
go
away
god
you
so
naive
she
laughed
in
derision
winston
bartlett
is
not
accustomed
to
having
to
ask
anybody
for
anything
so
the
fact
he
came
up
here
this
morning
to
try
to
get
you
to
back
off
on
whatever
it
is
you
doing
must
mean
you
really
got
him
psyched
she
stared
at
him
what
is
it
stone
tell
me
what
do
you
have
on
him
right
now
i
more
interested
in
what
he
thinks
i
might
have
and
the
truth
is
i
do
really
know
but
it
must
be
something
pretty
big
stone
why
is
it
so
hard
to
hate
you
you
can
make
a
person
life
miserable
and
that
stupid
person
will
still
root
for
you
god
i
know
what
it
was
about
you
she
paused
a
moment
as
though
thinking
maybe
you
just
too
honest
or
just
too
sincere
maybe
that
what
it
was
do
try
to
butter
me
up
i
know
my
weaknesses
but
dammit
jane
this
close
to
the
story
of
the
century
and
the
paranoid
zillionaire
who
was
in
here
just
now
yelling
at
me
is
trying
to
freeze
me
out
well
please
do
involve
me
in
this
anymore
stone
you
just
provided
me
with
a
week
worth
of
unnecessary
shit
from
now
on
any
communicating
you
want
to
do
with
gerex
attorneys
is
going
to
have
to
be
done
by
someone
else
trust
me
when
i
tell
you
i
do
not
need
this
in
my
life
sweetie
wait
till
you
see
what
i
on
the
track
of
what
the
gerex
corporation
is
doing
at
a
small
clinic
out
in
new
jersey
is
going
to
change
everything
we
know
about
medicine
and
it
going
to
blow
wide
open
the
second
they
finally
let
the
press
in
on
what
happening
at
the
clinical
trials
they
now
winding
up
for
the
nih
when
they
finally
hold
that
big
press
briefing
i
want
to
have
a
manuscript
already
in
copyediting
i
want
to
be
first
then
why
is
he
so
worked
up
over
your
question
she
mused
about
somebody
being
dropped
from
the
clinical
trials
she
paused
incidentally
i
can
do
without
being
called
by
a
man
i
no
longer
screwing
sorry
about
that
he
winced
it
did
just
sort
of
slip
out
in
this
orgy
of
intimacy
but
what
i
think
bartlett
desperately
does
want
me
to
find
out
is
the
reason
that
patient
was
dropped
and
he
afraid
i
getting
close
unfortunately
i
not
and
i
just
took
my
best
shot
at
prying
the
information
out
of
him
and
you
probably
right
blew
it
he
was
turning
to
leave
but
i
by
god
going
to
find
out
somehow
just
see
if
you
can
keep
me
from
getting
fired
for
a
little
while
longer
if
i
still
working
for
the
sentinel
three
months
from
now
you
may
get
honorable
mention
in
my
pulitzer
acceptance
it
was
bluff
talk
but
he
believed
it
with
every
fiber
of
his
body
you
got
ta
believe
right
come
on
ally
get
lucky
find
out
who
that
mystery
patient
was
the
way
things
look
now
you
the
only
shot
i
got
left
chapter
april
what
a
day
when
ally
finally
settled
onto
her
couch
after
giving
knickers
a
long
walk
she
was
exhausted
she
leaned
back
and
kicked
off
her
shoes
there
had
been
a
few
moments
of
tightness
in
her
chest
maybe
it
was
psychological
but
that
was
gone
now
she
thought
about
calling
new
jersey
to
ask
how
nina
was
doing
but
she
doubted
they
would
tell
her
anything
she
spent
the
latter
part
of
the
afternoon
getting
yet
another
heart
exam
after
driving
to
northern
new
jersey
and
back
she
had
a
formal
and
exhausting
stress
test
for
her
heart
at
the
new
york
university
faculty
practice
god
she
was
sick
of
examining
rooms
and
those
blue
paper
shifts
you
put
on
backwards
as
though
it
was
okay
for
doctors
and
nurses
to
see
your
bare
ass
then
she
put
on
shorts
and
sneakers
and
an
israeli
physician
stuck
wired
suction
cups
all
over
her
chest
and
put
her
on
a
treadmill
for
seventeen
minutes
boosting
her
pulse
to
over
which
was
as
high
as
he
dared
to
go
then
he
called
van
de
vliet
faxed
him
the
charts
and
they
reviewed
the
squiggly
lines
for
another
ten
minutes
finally
she
had
a
ct
scan
whose
results
were
then
sent
directly
to
karl
van
de
vliet
lab
computer
the
bottom
line
was
the
damaged
valve
in
her
aortic
ventricle
was
deteriorating
even
more
rapidly
than
her
regular
physician
ekelman
had
thought
but
her
heart
was
still
strong
enough
for
the
procedure
she
wondered
if
she
had
gone
this
far
because
she
was
letting
hope
outweigh
a
sober
evaluation
of
the
risks
was
this
the
sign
of
complete
desperation
whatever
she
decided
tomorrow
was
the
day
d
day
decision
day
she
thought
again
about
her
mom
who
had
been
bubbling
with
hope
when
she
looked
in
on
her
nina
had
even
been
formally
checked
in
but
already
she
seemed
transformed
it
was
enough
for
her
just
to
entertain
the
possibility
that
her
mind
could
be
renewed
that
in
itself
was
sufficient
to
convince
ally
to
sign
the
consent
agreement
for
van
de
vliet
to
go
forward
with
her
procedure
he
even
offered
to
provide
a
car
service
to
take
maria
home
to
the
bronx
after
nina
was
settled
and
resting
in
her
own
case
the
special
injections
for
her
heart
she
was
far
less
sure
what
she
thought
the
part
that
bothered
her
most
was
having
to
give
herself
entirely
over
to
a
person
she
scarcely
knew
it
was
the
kind
of
ultimate
surrender
that
she
abhorred
while
knickers
rummaged
behind
the
couch
for
the
remnants
of
her
rawhide
chew
toy
ally
momentarily
considered
calling
grant
she
could
think
of
a
reason
why
except
that
he
was
the
only
coherent
immediate
family
she
had
left
and
this
felt
like
a
moment
for
pulling
together
god
she
missed
steve
sometimes
she
felt
so
alone
then
she
considered
calling
stone
aimes
but
she
decided
that
would
seem
pushy
the
truth
was
she
enjoyed
talking
to
him
and
she
been
surprised
at
how
comfortable
she
felt
looking
back
over
the
elapsed
years
she
could
remember
exactly
why
they
split
up
there
must
have
been
a
good
reason
but
now
she
could
only
recall
the
good
times
a
picnic
in
central
park
or
the
time
they
took
the
staten
island
ferry
at
night
just
to
see
the
inspiring
downtown
skyline
with
those
jumbled
thoughts
cluttering
her
mind
she
finally
got
around
to
remembering
she
had
checked
her
phone
machine
she
got
up
off
the
couch
and
went
into
the
bedroom
there
were
three
calls
and
at
first
she
thought
she
was
too
exhausted
to
check
them
but
no
that
was
irresponsible
she
was
running
a
business
hi
ally
it
me
the
voice
was
jennifer
no
emergency
but
call
when
you
get
in
and
let
me
know
how
it
went
okay
not
tonight
there
was
too
much
to
explain
and
she
was
too
tired
she
went
to
the
second
message
hi
it
me
again
i
need
you
to
look
over
the
jameson
design
that
bath
they
having
trouble
getting
the
ocher
some
kind
of
strike
at
the
quarry
what
can
they
substitute
but
remember
it
got
to
be
absurdly
overpriced
or
they
assume
it
crap
if
i
do
hear
back
from
you
i
fax
you
some
stuff
in
the
morning
okay
she
thought
these
rich
clients
love
to
show
off
i
get
them
what
they
should
have
ordered
in
the
first
place
knowing
them
stone
from
the
quarry
near
agra
where
they
got
the
marble
for
the
taj
mahal
that
ought
to
be
ostentatious
enough
it
take
an
extra
couple
of
months
but
that
will
impress
them
even
more
as
she
considered
going
to
the
third
message
she
had
a
feeling
of
misgiving
though
in
truth
there
were
several
people
she
would
mind
hearing
from
or
maybe
the
dorian
institute
had
called
about
nina
maybe
freaked
this
whole
thing
was
happening
way
too
fast
in
any
case
she
did
really
want
to
talk
to
anybody
right
now
what
she
really
wanted
to
do
was
sit
and
think
maybe
run
the
whole
thing
by
stone
and
get
his
take
she
decided
to
check
out
the
third
message
hi
it
your
intrepid
reporter
just
checking
in
to
see
how
it
went
today
it
just
after
eight
and
i
at
home
i
may
not
be
able
to
afford
this
place
much
longer
given
all
the
excitement
i
had
today
so
call
me
while
i
still
have
an
apartment
and
a
phone
she
felt
a
ripple
of
excitement
and
the
feeling
pleased
her
maybe
she
did
have
someone
stable
and
rational
in
her
corner
someone
who
understood
the
risks
and
possible
rewards
of
going
forward
with
the
procedure
she
put
his
number
in
her
palm
which
was
in
her
bag
and
she
went
back
to
the
living
room
poured
herself
a
glass
of
wine
and
then
retrieved
it
she
heard
him
pick
up
on
the
second
ring
hi
it
ally
thanks
for
checking
on
me
i
really
not
in
the
greatest
shape
at
the
moment
oh
yeah
so
how
it
go
well
i
met
dr
miracle
she
paused
i
do
know
quite
how
to
handle
you
stone
are
we
having
some
kind
of
reunion
the
affair
redux
are
we
friends
all
over
again
two
days
ago
all
we
had
were
memories
then
i
start
getting
phone
calls
from
you
i
still
do
know
what
i
supposed
to
think
i
tell
you
what
i
think
i
think
we
playing
this
by
ear
i
know
what
you
been
doing
for
the
years
that
i
have
seen
you
i
do
know
what
you
know
about
me
so
this
is
kind
of
like
a
blind
date
with
a
lot
of
baggage
i
agree
she
said
then
hesitated
her
resolve
was
melting
i
might
as
well
say
this
is
it
too
late
to
come
down
and
talk
i
thought
i
was
tough
enough
to
handle
this
on
my
own
but
i
definitely
could
use
psychological
support
give
me
the
address
i
could
use
a
little
support
myself
i
got
tlhreatened
today
i
think
by
somebody
who
would
like
to
crush
me
like
a
bug
and
easily
could
i
spare
you
the
ironies
but
you
and
i
may
have
more
in
common
than
you
think
my
interest
in
the
gerex
corporation
has
just
gotten
extremely
personal
after
she
hung
up
she
felt
energized
and
she
decided
to
give
jennifer
a
call
after
all
in
truth
she
wanted
to
tell
her
about
stone
and
to
get
her
take
on
whether
seeing
him
was
a
good
idea
are
these
things
always
doomed
hi
jen
i
home
and
i
making
all
kinds
of
fateful
decisions
so
what
happened
are
you
going
to
be
a
guinea
pig
for
that
clinic
is
that
what
you
think
it
amounts
to
she
could
tell
how
serious
jennifer
intended
to
be
i
still
debating
it
mom
loved
the
place
well
good
good
for
her
but
you
still
not
sure
about
you
i
leaning
she
paused
jen
somebody
i
used
to
see
in
college
is
on
his
way
down
here
right
now
he
a
medical
reporter
but
the
truth
is
i
do
know
why
i
asked
him
i
guess
if
i
were
your
shrink
i
ask
do
you
feel
about
that
if
i
knew
the
answer
to
that
i
would
need
you
to
be
a
support
group
she
bit
her
lip
he
doing
a
book
about
stem
cell
procedures
so
in
a
way
it
a
lucky
break
that
he
appeared
exactly
when
he
did
yeah
ally
if
you
ask
me
it
sounds
like
it
was
a
lucky
break
in
more
than
one
way
an
old
flame
reappearing
can
be
a
positive
sign
high
time
something
happened
in
your
life
you
tighter
than
you
know
she
thought
i
ready
for
this
whether
i
admit
it
to
myself
or
not
but
is
there
going
to
be
any
chemistry
when
we
actually
see
each
other
there
used
to
be
a
lot
the
embarrassing
thing
was
her
first
thought
was
to
wonder
if
he
was
still
terrific
in
bed
she
remembered
thinking
he
was
very
adroit
back
then
but
back
then
she
did
have
much
experience
to
compare
him
with
mainly
thinking
about
him
now
made
her
painfully
aware
she
was
overdue
for
some
closeness
april
pm
she
going
to
think
of
me
stone
wondered
as
he
knocked
gently
on
the
door
she
buzzed
him
up
from
the
lobby
without
a
word
more
to
the
point
he
thought
what
am
i
going
to
say
if
she
wants
an
opinion
about
whether
she
should
undergo
the
procedure
or
not
so
far
the
only
evidence
i
have
that
the
clinical
trials
are
working
is
circumstantial
the
patients
who
been
through
the
sequence
and
discharged
so
how
can
i
in
good
faith
advise
her
one
way
or
the
other
but
he
then
concluded
i
getting
way
ahead
of
myself
she
may
take
one
look
at
me
and
decide
she
was
right
to
dump
me
the
first
time
nice
building
though
housing
for
not
like
the
starter
setup
i
been
reduced
to
he
knocked
he
always
hated
the
idea
of
ringing
a
bell
on
an
apartment
door
and
a
second
later
it
opened
alexa
hampton
and
stone
aimes
just
stood
awkwardly
for
a
moment
and
stared
taking
each
other
in
finally
you
look
great
they
both
said
it
simultaneously
and
that
served
to
make
the
moment
even
more
awkward
well
he
said
finally
into
the
silence
you
do
and
he
meant
it
there
was
however
a
lot
of
strain
on
her
face
in
her
eyes
the
mark
the
years
had
left
seemed
more
psychic
than
physical
you
do
look
so
bad
yourself
god
it
seems
like
a
lifetime
ago
when
we
went
to
our
separate
corners
he
said
after
another
long
contemplative
pause
then
he
stepped
in
and
she
closed
the
door
he
did
try
to
peck
her
cheek
for
which
she
looked
relieved
tell
me
how
you
doing
really
you
really
want
to
know
okay
this
afternoon
i
had
a
heart
checkup
nobody
wants
to
put
odds
on
this
thing
but
my
condition
is
getting
worse
she
led
him
through
to
the
living
room
then
we
should
talk
he
said
looking
around
i
love
your
loft
by
the
way
you
make
me
envy
you
you
should
see
the
makeshift
quarters
i
live
in
i
sort
of
waiting
for
my
ship
to
come
in
the
truth
is
stone
that
i
no
longer
know
the
first
thing
about
you
or
your
life
and
i
think
i
like
to
we
but
world
enough
and
time
he
smiled
we
get
around
to
the
catching
up
but
i
do
flatter
myself
that
you
asked
me
down
at
this
hour
to
reminisce
about
our
respective
pasts
you
already
got
me
figured
out
she
made
a
face
i
do
know
whether
i
like
that
or
not
by
the
way
would
you
care
for
something
you
used
to
like
scotch
right
the
operative
part
of
that
statement
is
to
these
days
i
try
to
avoid
anything
harder
than
beer
i
was
starting
to
have
an
ethanol
dependency
problem
i
think
it
a
common
occupational
hazard
for
a
reporter
i
do
keep
beer
around
it
fattening
how
about
some
diet
cranberry
juice
maybe
i
have
that
scotch
after
all
he
laughed
i
have
a
feeling
it
might
be
more
suited
to
the
occasion
know
what
i
think
i
join
you
she
walked
into
the
kitchen
and
started
making
the
drinks
on
the
rocks
right
good
memory
stone
i
asked
you
down
because
i
got
to
make
a
big
decision
she
was
bringing
the
drinks
into
the
living
room
tonight
you
the
closest
thing
i
got
to
a
knowledgeable
sounding
board
you
have
some
idea
of
the
risks
and
rewards
here
so
do
i
check
into
the
dorian
institute
and
let
them
start
injecting
stem
cells
into
me
or
not
turns
out
that
what
van
de
vliet
wants
to
do
we
in
worse
trouble
than
we
thought
he
took
a
scotch
you
at
least
seen
the
place
i
do
have
a
shred
of
actual
physical
evidence
that
those
clinical
trials
are
producing
results
i
can
make
inferences
from
what
i
see
on
the
web
site
but
it
nothing
you
can
take
to
the
bank
he
ventured
a
sip
then
looked
up
by
the
way
did
you
get
a
chance
to
ask
about
the
patient
who
got
dropped
oh
shit
i
forgot
she
sighed
there
was
so
much
going
on
with
mom
and
all
the
rest
that
it
completely
slipped
my
do
worry
about
it
he
said
with
a
sigh
come
on
ally
she
thought
this
could
be
really
important
you
got
to
get
focused
i
try
to
remember
tomorrow
i
do
think
it
kind
of
vital
but
be
careful
not
to
mention
my
name
i
i
just
acquired
some
problems
of
my
own
with
the
gerex
corporation
what
kind
of
let
me
take
a
rain
check
on
answering
that
suffice
to
say
not
thrilled
about
the
idea
that
i
doing
a
book
in
which
prominently
featured
he
paused
look
ally
there
a
lot
going
on
here
including
that
patient
who
was
dropped
for
some
reason
that
nobody
wants
to
disclose
but
if
you
do
decide
to
do
it
you
have
a
better
physician
karl
van
de
vliet
is
quite
possibly
the
world
leading
researcher
in
stem
cell
technology
on
the
other
hand
this
is
the
first
time
there
been
actual
human
trials
if
anybody
tells
you
there
no
risk
then
they
not
behaving
ethically
well
the
way
things
stand
now
i
due
out
there
at
the
institute
at
ten
tomorrow
if
i
want
to
i
can
be
formally
entered
into
the
clinical
trials
on
the
spot
i
passed
my
qualifying
exam
you
know
the
trials
are
almost
over
it
like
they
taking
you
at
the
last
minute
that
what
he
said
i
going
to
be
the
last
whatever
my
friend
jennifer
just
called
me
a
guinea
pig
van
de
vliet
also
said
i
have
to
stay
out
there
for
at
least
a
couple
of
weeks
probably
longer
that
going
to
be
a
bloody
drag
since
things
are
really
busy
down
at
citispace
now
ally
given
what
i
know
or
do
know
i
do
have
an
entirely
good
feeling
about
this
it
could
be
they
hiding
something
but
i
have
a
clue
what
it
is
it
quite
possibly
connected
to
that
patient
who
got
terminated
and
when
i
tried
to
raise
this
with
attorneys
no
less
person
than
winston
bartlett
himself
went
ballistic
what
are
you
saying
that
i
should
do
it
hey
i
ca
make
that
decision
for
you
but
one
possibility
would
be
to
just
play
along
for
a
day
or
two
and
see
if
you
ca
find
out
a
little
more
about
what
went
wrong
with
the
patient
who
was
dropped
stone
that
maybe
a
little
paranoid
could
a
single
patient
have
been
dropped
for
a
whole
bunch
of
different
reasons
of
course
but
it
not
that
simple
a
patient
was
dropped
from
the
gerex
clinical
trials
and
there
was
no
official
reason
given
in
the
data
file
it
made
me
curious
enough
that
i
had
our
paper
attorney
pass
along
a
question
about
it
to
their
attorneys
that
motivated
winston
bartlett
to
come
personally
to
threaten
me
so
why
is
a
guy
who
runs
a
huge
conglomerate
suddenly
afraid
of
one
tiny
question
is
there
some
problem
some
reaction
to
the
procedure
that
they
terrified
will
come
to
light
ultimately
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
are
at
stake
i
want
the
book
i
writing
to
tell
the
whole
story
not
just
the
part
they
want
to
have
told
that
why
god
put
reporters
on
earth
shit
stone
i
glad
you
here
i
think
i
told
you
on
the
phone
i
had
someone
i
loved
very
much
disappear
on
me
some
years
ago
and
feeling
very
alone
at
the
moment
she
looked
him
over
okay
ask
we
adults
are
you
married
divorced
attached
unattached
seeing
someone
alone
and
suicidal
what
i
mean
where
do
things
stand
here
where
things
stand
is
that
i
very
happy
that
i
stumbled
into
you
after
all
the
years
and
yeah
i
got
a
little
history
at
least
like
to
think
so
but
nothing
is
going
on
at
the
moment
then
he
told
her
about
joyce
the
divorce
amy
and
what
was
that
you
said
about
having
somebody
disappear
on
you
he
studied
her
reaching
back
for
the
feelings
that
were
still
buried
seeing
her
was
bringing
it
back
what
did
you
mean
by
that
disappear
like
a
missing
person
or
disappear
as
in
up
and
split
or
he
was
my
husband
steve
and
he
was
a
political
consultant
he
was
in
a
cessna
that
went
down
in
the
rain
forest
in
belize
and
i
miss
him
terribly
i
so
sorry
ally
nothing
that
happened
to
me
comes
close
to
that
tragedy
it
gets
worse
a
few
months
before
that
my
dad
had
an
accident
with
a
browning
shotgun
that
was
no
accident
jesus
what
that
line
about
how
the
troubles
tread
on
one
heels
was
he
depressed
i
guess
that
a
stupid
question
he
thought
he
was
going
to
lose
his
business
after
a
lifetime
of
work
what
do
you
think
ally
i
really
sorry
about
all
that
well
i
suppose
it
could
be
worse
as
i
recall
you
never
knew
your
dad
did
you
when
am
i
going
to
tell
her
the
truth
he
asked
himself
let
get
off
the
history
topic
tonight
what
do
you
say
we
both
get
ourselves
depressed
agreed
she
sipped
at
her
scotch
so
you
saying
i
should
play
along
and
see
if
i
can
find
out
something
about
this
discharged
patient
the
mere
mention
of
whom
causes
grown
millionaires
to
become
unhinged
it
what
would
do
he
said
finishing
off
his
scotch
and
settling
the
glass
on
a
coaster
on
a
side
table
then
he
got
up
i
have
to
tell
you
ally
you
look
awfully
tired
i
love
to
be
responsible
for
keeping
you
up
all
night
but
i
doubt
that
would
be
a
humane
act
it
might
remind
me
of
a
time
long
ago
and
not
so
far
away
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
but
you
right
when
i
get
this
tired
i
can
precipitate
an
episode
i
offer
to
drive
you
out
there
tomorrow
but
that
would
just
get
you
in
trouble
they
probably
have
orders
to
shoot
me
on
sight
i
the
number
one
persona
non
grata
with
the
top
management
of
the
gerex
corporation
at
the
moment
so
i
the
last
person
you
want
to
be
seen
with
right
now
the
only
way
you
going
to
find
out
what
hiding
is
if
nobody
suspects
anything
which
means
you
got
to
show
up
alone
maybe
that
true
she
thought
but
you
a
person
i
like
to
be
with
tonight
thanks
for
coming
over
she
walked
over
and
pecked
him
on
the
cheek
you
vulnerable
tonight
she
told
herself
wanting
to
ask
him
to
stay
do
start
making
any
big
life
decisions
chapter
april
bartlett
looked
at
the
white
phone
on
the
oak
end
table
beside
his
chair
and
argued
with
himself
about
picking
it
up
and
calling
the
dutchman
when
van
de
vliet
was
at
his
office
at
the
institute
they
communicated
by
encrypted
videophone
by
this
time
though
he
was
usually
home
but
he
still
had
called
to
say
what
had
happened
with
alexa
hampton
now
they
would
have
to
talk
over
an
open
line
damn
him
after
his
explosive
with
stone
aimes
damn
him
too
bartlett
had
gone
up
to
the
park
avenue
place
to
check
on
kristen
firsthand
and
try
to
console
her
but
he
was
actually
sure
she
recognized
him
at
times
she
seemed
to
and
then
at
other
times
she
would
just
stare
at
him
blankly
her
mind
increasingly
had
an
relationship
with
reality
and
today
was
an
out
day
the
time
had
come
to
be
deeply
concerned
about
her
she
could
be
kept
under
wraps
forever
he
had
checked
her
into
the
dorian
institute
under
an
assumed
name
kirby
parker
to
try
to
avoid
any
publicity
now
that
was
the
only
name
she
could
remember
how
had
the
syndrome
done
that
to
her
kristen
starr
whose
identity
was
known
to
several
million
watchers
of
cable
tv
could
no
longer
remember
her
own
name
karl
had
worked
with
her
every
day
but
no
medication
he
had
tried
had
even
minimally
slowed
the
syndrome
progress
the
beta
had
seemed
so
promising
kristen
body
had
been
rejuvenated
her
face
was
looking
like
she
had
perfect
plastic
surgery
and
there
been
no
discernible
side
effects
it
was
everything
they
all
hoped
for
kristen
was
elated
and
even
the
normally
cautious
van
de
vliet
was
buoyed
yes
the
beta
was
so
close
karl
had
to
find
a
way
to
make
it
work
in
spite
of
all
winston
bartlett
entrepreneurial
he
always
knew
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
time
he
was
getting
ever
closer
to
that
final
dance
with
destiny
but
but
what
if
the
beta
could
be
made
to
work
the
way
van
de
vliet
theorized
it
might
was
there
the
possibility
the
music
would
never
stop
nursing
a
second
glenfiddich
he
looked
around
the
room
the
floor
finding
it
pleased
him
as
always
this
room
of
his
mansion
was
a
handmade
gem
from
new
york
century
gilded
age
with
molded
plasterwork
ceilings
and
brass
doorknobs
and
mahogany
paneling
favorites
from
his
superlative
japanese
sword
collection
lined
the
walls
giving
him
constant
joy
he
wanted
to
live
to
enjoy
it
for
another
three
score
and
ten
the
only
galling
thing
about
the
place
was
that
he
had
to
share
it
with
eileen
who
had
the
top
two
floors
they
had
been
living
in
marital
purgatory
for
the
past
years
ever
since
she
found
out
about
the
existence
of
his
natural
son
because
of
that
humiliation
she
had
refused
to
give
him
the
one
thing
he
most
wanted
from
her
his
freedom
she
let
it
be
known
that
as
long
as
he
flaunted
a
string
of
mistresses
in
the
cheap
tabloid
press
she
was
determined
to
stay
in
his
face
he
sighed
and
took
a
last
sip
of
his
scotch
then
set
it
down
and
clicked
on
the
phone
van
de
vliet
had
rented
a
small
villa
half
a
mile
down
the
lakeshore
south
from
the
institute
and
he
lived
alone
until
recently
he
been
sleeping
in
the
lab
there
was
no
encrypted
phone
where
he
lived
so
this
had
damned
well
better
be
brief
karl
it
me
how
did
it
go
today
with
the
new
beta
prospect
i
contracted
her
to
do
some
work
here
hoping
to
do
my
part
to
get
her
with
the
program
i
was
expecting
to
hear
from
you
by
now
i
met
with
her
and
she
had
a
stress
test
this
afternoon
in
the
city
other
than
the
aortic
stenosis
she
seems
to
be
in
superb
shape
which
is
important
i
assuming
make
that
hoping
that
she
come
back
in
the
morning
and
formally
enter
the
clinical
trials
i
let
you
know
if
she
does
till
that
happens
i
have
no
progress
to
report
all
right
but
how
soon
after
that
do
you
think
you
could
get
started
with
the
beta
matter
there
was
a
pregnant
pause
and
then
we
truly
need
to
talk
and
maybe
not
on
this
line
just
before
i
left
the
lab
i
ran
another
simulation
on
the
mothership
to
try
to
figure
out
what
dosage
level
of
beta
enzyme
would
be
safe
but
like
trying
to
extrapolate
backwards
and
i
just
do
have
enough
data
i
beginning
to
wonder
if
using
her
to
try
to
create
telomerase
antibodies
is
actually
such
a
good
idea
it
just
so
risky
his
voice
trailed
off
karl
everything
in
life
is
a
goddam
risk
i
know
i
supposed
to
be
the
beneficiary
here
but
if
the
antibody
concept
works
out
we
might
still
be
able
to
do
something
for
beta
one
i
already
doing
everything
i
know
how
for
her
that
a
tragedy
we
all
still
in
denial
about
and
now
we
talking
about
risking
yet
another
woman
yes
maybe
it
the
answer
but
for
now
i
do
know
what
a
safe
dosage
of
enzyme
should
be
it
has
to
be
enough
to
generate
the
antibodies
but
not
so
great
that
you
know
what
i
talking
about
i
sure
as
hell
do
bartlett
thought
i
looking
at
the
syndrome
myself
karl
just
think
of
what
it
could
mean
if
you
could
get
the
beta
to
work
the
way
the
other
procedures
do
what
great
medical
discovery
did
have
a
few
missteps
at
the
beginning
this
is
experimental
medicine
that
could
change
the
world
so
dammit
we
got
to
take
risks
why
are
we
having
this
conversation
at
this
time
of
night
over
an
unsecure
phone
because
we
do
have
a
lot
of
time
bartlett
growled
we
got
nineteen
days
left
on
the
clinical
trials
that
certainly
enough
time
to
conclude
the
procedure
on
her
heart
but
if
we
also
try
to
karl
bartlett
said
it
the
beta
we
should
be
focusing
on
looking
at
the
syndrome
myself
now
though
i
think
i
got
the
strength
of
will
to
handle
it
my
mind
is
a
lot
stronger
than
kris
beta
one
but
i
do
want
to
have
to
find
out
you
got
to
get
this
fucking
problem
fixed
if
we
do
use
her
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
how
unethical
this
is
about
to
become
bartlett
wanted
to
remind
van
de
vliet
that
ethics
were
the
least
of
their
problems
at
the
moment
but
that
was
the
kind
of
thing
you
aired
over
an
unsecure
phone
connection
karl
just
fucking
do
it
he
said
finally
if
she
not
under
way
with
the
beta
before
the
end
of
this
week
ethics
are
not
going
to
be
your
primary
concern
i
may
have
to
revisit
some
of
our
agreements
cross
me
and
you
forfeit
a
lot
all
right
he
sighed
i
know
what
i
can
do
to
make
sure
she
in
good
do
it
whatever
it
is
he
now
had
to
warn
van
de
vliet
about
stone
aimes
but
how
much
information
should
he
provide
he
quickly
decided
to
keep
it
simple
oh
and
as
though
we
did
already
have
enough
problems
there
something
else
i
need
to
alert
you
about
there
a
reporter
from
the
new
york
sentinel
nosing
around
yesterday
he
got
to
my
legal
department
and
asked
about
beta
one
though
he
does
know
her
name
yet
he
somehow
found
out
she
was
terminated
from
the
clinical
trials
please
tell
me
you
have
been
talking
to
the
press
behind
my
back
my
god
i
been
waiting
for
this
to
happen
van
de
vliet
sounded
like
someone
who
had
just
had
the
wind
knocked
out
of
him
you
know
grant
once
mentioned
that
a
reporter
had
been
pestering
him
about
getting
an
interview
with
me
when
maybe
two
months
ago
possibly
three
first
i
heard
about
it
bartlett
said
i
wish
he
told
me
i
could
have
taken
steps
it
might
be
the
same
person
now
that
i
think
about
it
i
do
remember
he
mentioned
the
sentinel
how
much
do
you
think
he
knows
i
not
sure
the
question
in
my
mind
is
how
did
he
find
out
about
her
in
the
first
place
he
supposedly
doing
a
book
about
us
karl
a
book
about
this
project
well
that
the
first
i
heard
about
that
christ
a
book
i
think
he
just
fishing
at
the
moment
but
this
should
be
a
warning
we
got
to
keep
security
tight
what
do
you
know
about
him
is
he
good
yes
bartlett
thought
he
damned
good
the
truth
is
i
almost
proud
of
him
sometimes
he
the
medical
columnist
for
the
paper
so
happens
i
own
the
building
where
their
editorial
offices
are
i
do
have
time
to
read
newspapers
well
he
good
enough
that
we
may
have
to
handle
him
somehow
what
are
you
trying
to
say
van
de
vliet
asked
though
he
sounded
like
he
already
knew
what
i
saying
is
he
a
pro
and
i
get
the
strong
impression
hungry
hungry
for
money
or
for
fame
if
i
knew
that
i
know
what
to
do
next
bartlett
said
probably
some
of
both
he
thought
if
the
kid
is
anything
like
his
old
man
then
why
do
we
give
him
an
interview
meet
the
whole
matter
on
i
always
found
it
better
to
shape
the
news
yourself
rather
than
trying
to
stonewall
which
usually
means
a
lot
of
speculation
ends
up
getting
published
and
then
you
have
to
correct
it
after
the
fact
also
the
best
way
to
find
out
how
much
a
reporter
already
knows
idiot
bartlett
thought
that
the
worst
possible
thing
we
could
do
this
kid
would
have
your
balls
for
a
bow
tie
karl
you
just
provided
a
perfect
illustration
of
why
i
have
my
own
people
handling
the
press
some
amateur
like
you
starts
talking
to
a
guy
like
that
and
the
next
thing
you
know
you
might
as
well
be
on
sodium
pentathol
again
his
name
is
stone
aimes
remember
it
and
do
ever
even
think
about
exchanging
a
single
word
with
him
my
experience
is
that
you
can
only
stonewall
the
press
for
so
long
if
they
any
good
at
all
sooner
or
later
they
going
to
find
out
more
than
you
want
them
to
the
only
way
to
forestall
that
is
to
parcel
them
carefully
controlled
information
to
work
with
trust
me
i
had
a
little
experience
with
reporters
too
you
ca
treat
them
like
they
complete
dolts
you
have
to
them
bring
them
into
your
confidence
and
then
convince
them
that
it
in
interest
for
them
to
help
you
rather
than
harm
you
so
why
do
you
let
me
talk
to
this
guy
we
could
always
start
off
with
the
carrot
and
then
move
on
to
the
stick
this
conversation
is
making
me
very
nervous
karl
i
do
want
you
or
any
of
your
people
within
a
mile
of
him
i
mean
it
goddamit
with
which
winston
bartlett
slammed
down
the
phone
shit
what
are
we
going
to
do
so
far
van
de
vliet
had
helped
kristen
in
the
slightest
okay
she
wanted
to
try
the
beta
but
still
what
happened
was
a
tragedy
and
who
are
we
kidding
stone
was
going
to
back
off
seeing
his
natural
and
only
son
again
after
a
lot
of
years
had
shaken
him
up
more
than
he
had
expected
at
some
level
he
wanted
to
feel
proud
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
but
now
if
anything
got
published
about
the
syndrome
the
financial
consequences
could
be
devastating
stone
aimes
had
to
be
kept
at
bay
long
enough
to
complete
the
buyout
unfortunately
it
might
come
to
involve
force
he
smiled
to
think
that
kenji
noda
would
be
ready
for
that
challenge
but
overt
violence
really
was
winston
bartlett
style
at
least
it
had
been
his
style
up
to
now
but
he
was
staring
at
the
horrific
possibility
of
the
syndrome
starting
very
soon
a
lot
of
things
might
have
to
be
handled
differently
chapter
april
ally
was
walking
down
the
marble
hallway
of
the
dorian
institute
feeling
a
mixture
of
hope
and
dread
she
parked
her
blue
toyota
in
the
same
slot
she
done
the
day
before
and
then
she
gone
through
the
security
check
at
the
front
entrance
which
included
verifying
again
a
solid
id
and
a
check
for
any
kind
of
camera
or
recording
equipment
maria
did
not
come
along
she
was
using
this
as
an
occasion
to
have
some
time
off
with
her
grandchild
the
caregiver
was
giving
herself
some
care
the
downstairs
foyer
had
been
empty
except
for
security
and
staff
and
she
paused
just
long
enough
to
sign
in
and
ask
the
receptionist
at
the
central
desk
which
room
nina
hampton
was
in
was
her
mother
going
to
be
as
enthusiastic
about
being
here
today
as
she
been
yesterday
truthfully
just
to
see
her
spirits
immediately
improve
yesterday
was
a
high
in
itself
but
who
knew
maybe
she
could
be
helped
i
think
she
let
me
check
she
pulled
up
a
computer
screen
right
hampton
is
in
room
second
floor
looked
up
and
smiled
your
mother
i
assume
she
quite
a
card
i
hear
she
doing
very
well
you
can
use
the
elevator
over
there
i
take
the
stairs
ally
had
said
they
were
wide
and
blue
marble
and
had
a
kind
of
splendor
as
they
seemed
to
literally
flow
down
from
the
upstairs
landing
i
did
have
my
run
this
morning
the
marble
hallway
upstairs
showed
no
signs
of
use
the
place
felt
more
like
a
grandiose
palace
from
another
time
than
a
hospital
doing
research
there
was
a
nurse
station
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
and
two
women
were
there
in
blue
uniforms
other
than
that
however
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
the
dorian
institute
was
a
medical
facility
it
could
easily
have
been
an
exclusive
resort
hotel
it
did
feel
medical
or
aseptic
in
any
way
stone
should
see
this
she
thought
he
definitely
be
impressed
driving
out
this
morning
alone
she
been
thinking
about
him
a
lot
there
was
something
about
him
that
was
different
from
what
remembered
over
all
the
years
he
was
as
serious
as
ever
about
his
work
but
she
suspected
he
might
possibly
be
more
fun
now
that
he
seemed
to
have
lightened
up
some
he
used
to
be
wound
extremely
tight
in
any
case
she
was
finding
herself
surprisingly
happy
to
talk
to
him
again
whether
or
not
it
went
any
further
but
was
his
concern
about
the
mysterious
terminated
patient
justified
and
what
if
anything
did
that
have
to
do
with
her
she
was
still
musing
about
that
when
she
heard
the
language
tv
going
in
room
even
before
she
touched
the
doorknob
that
a
good
sign
she
thought
she
pushed
open
the
door
and
strode
in
the
room
was
decorated
in
earth
tones
including
a
lovely
brown
carpet
which
had
indian
symbols
in
it
probably
navajo
the
bed
was
a
single
but
it
was
faux
early
american
not
a
hospital
bed
again
the
place
felt
more
like
a
resort
than
a
research
institute
nina
was
sitting
up
leaning
against
the
headboard
and
wearing
blue
silk
pajamas
underneath
a
white
bed
coat
mom
how
you
feeling
you
look
great
it
was
true
she
was
wearing
a
lull
complement
of
makeup
and
her
hair
looked
like
it
been
newly
washed
whatever
else
was
going
on
the
dorian
institute
was
making
sure
patients
looked
their
best
do
they
have
a
beautician
on
staff
she
wondered
also
there
was
a
sparkle
in
her
mother
eyes
that
she
had
seen
since
before
her
father
died
how
does
it
look
like
i
feeling
nina
reached
for
the
remote
and
muted
the
sound
from
the
tv
yes
that
old
twinkle
is
definitely
there
gee
i
have
to
say
that
you
seem
a
lot
better
than
you
did
yesterday
it
was
true
thank
goodness
she
was
having
one
of
those
supercogent
days
she
laughed
deep
and
resonant
ally
you
have
no
idea
he
started
in
with
the
injections
yesterday
evening
after
you
left
when
i
woke
up
this
morning
i
could
remember
everything
that
happened
yesterday
i
even
remembered
why
i
was
in
this
strange
place
try
me
ask
me
something
and
see
if
i
can
remember
it
go
ahead
ask
me
anything
okay
she
thought
a
moment
it
should
be
something
easy
when
was
dad
birthday
march
twelfth
she
did
even
hesitate
you
have
to
do
better
than
that
how
about
my
birthday
you
could
remember
it
last
week
nina
paused
and
looked
disoriented
for
a
moment
ally
thought
i
pushed
her
too
hard
it
was
october
third
a
smile
abruptly
took
over
her
face
as
though
she
was
experiencing
a
live
breakthrough
you
were
born
at
roosevelt
hospital
at
in
the
afternoon
mom
this
is
incredible
she
was
joyously
stunned
though
it
felt
like
something
resembling
shock
it
a
miracle
your
mother
responsiveness
is
impressive
karl
van
de
vliet
said
as
he
strode
through
the
open
door
startling
her
ellen
will
run
the
first
battery
of
monitoring
tests
later
this
morning
memory
and
the
like
but
from
all
appearances
there
been
a
lot
of
tissue
regeneration
under
way
overnight
is
is
this
permanent
ally
asked
not
wanting
to
let
herself
get
her
hopes
up
too
soon
and
what
is
he
doing
no
one
can
answer
that
question
he
looked
at
nina
and
smiled
but
this
is
not
some
drug
regimen
to
trick
the
brain
chemistry
hampton
you
have
my
word
in
alzheimer
tissue
responsible
for
the
production
of
certain
neurotransmitters
dies
what
we
doing
here
is
enabling
your
brain
to
regrow
healthy
tissue
to
replace
what
has
become
damaged
and
destroyed
by
an
excess
of
the
wrong
let
just
say
we
not
trying
to
salvage
damaged
tissue
actually
replacing
the
dysfunctional
tissue
in
the
cortical
and
hippocampal
regions
of
the
brain
so
we
working
with
the
body
and
you
responding
wonderfully
he
turned
back
to
ally
i
got
to
get
back
to
the
lab
now
come
on
down
when
you
ready
and
finish
the
paperwork
she
started
to
say
she
wanted
to
ask
him
to
linger
a
moment
and
answer
a
few
questions
but
before
she
could
he
disappeared
into
the
hallway
ally
i
have
felt
this
alive
in
months
nina
bubbled
on
vee
did
a
minor
procedure
late
yesterday
afternoon
using
local
anesthesia
then
he
did
something
in
his
laboratory
and
came
back
and
gave
me
an
injection
then
there
was
another
one
this
morning
it
supposed
to
continue
for
a
week
or
two
ellen
said
she
be
giving
me
one
of
those
little
memory
tests
every
day
to
see
if
i
improving
but
you
know
i
already
know
i
can
tell
a
difference
it
just
been
overnight
but
i
swear
some
of
the
haze
is
already
gone
i
so
happy
for
you
ally
felt
a
surge
of
joy
already
she
was
thinking
about
some
new
trips
they
could
take
together
come
over
here
and
sit
by
me
she
said
patting
the
bed
i
was
thinking
about
arthur
again
this
morning
if
doctor
vee
can
do
something
for
your
heart
it
would
be
a
miracle
that
would
have
meant
so
much
to
him
it
just
so
sad
he
ca
be
here
to
see
this
as
ally
settled
next
to
her
nina
reached
over
and
took
her
hand
i
want
to
ask
you
something
darling
just
between
us
why
do
you
think
seth
grant
is
doing
this
for
me
for
us
what
do
you
mean
ally
was
trying
to
read
her
thoughts
wondering
where
the
topic
was
headed
nina
had
declared
on
sunday
that
she
thought
there
was
something
evil
about
grant
now
this
i
hate
to
say
it
about
my
own
son
but
caring
is
not
his
first
nature
mom
we
see
him
so
seldom
do
you
really
think
either
one
of
us
still
understands
him
nina
and
grant
had
never
been
all
that
close
in
fact
he
always
been
something
of
a
secretive
loner
within
the
family
even
though
he
was
very
much
an
extrovert
with
his
friends
of
which
he
had
many
or
at
least
used
to
ally
had
left
for
college
just
as
he
reached
high
school
which
meant
she
was
around
during
his
impressionable
teen
years
and
when
she
came
back
to
take
over
citispace
he
was
virtually
a
fugitive
from
the
family
i
remember
plenty
about
him
you
think
i
do
know
my
own
son
lord
help
me
well
mom
i
not
really
prepared
to
talk
about
him
it
was
so
upsetting
just
to
see
him
i
could
really
take
everything
in
she
smiled
and
touched
nina
brow
which
felt
warm
and
flush
but
tell
you
something
i
am
taking
in
you
really
looking
great
i
know
what
he
doing
but
hope
darling
it
the
greatest
tonic
in
the
world
even
if
there
no
good
reason
for
it
she
squeezed
ally
hand
and
i
do
so
wish
arthur
could
be
here
now
i
miss
him
so
much
i
know
mom
he
was
as
much
a
friend
to
me
as
he
was
a
dad
she
thought
back
fondly
over
her
father
many
passions
and
how
shared
a
lot
of
them
with
him
one
had
been
the
romantic
poets
particularly
wordsworth
and
shelley
then
he
had
his
astronomy
period
and
they
spent
a
lot
of
time
together
at
the
planetarium
but
he
took
an
interest
in
her
passions
as
well
when
at
age
eight
she
decided
to
collect
coins
he
went
to
the
bank
and
brought
back
rolls
and
rolls
of
dimes
and
nickels
for
her
to
go
through
and
during
the
summertime
he
take
her
and
grant
on
the
lirr
to
long
beach
every
other
sunday
all
summer
long
that
was
why
the
pain
the
personal
loss
of
his
horrible
death
had
never
fully
subsided
perhaps
it
never
would
but
the
difference
between
them
was
that
he
had
finally
lost
his
will
to
live
whereas
ally
found
her
own
will
growing
all
the
more
with
every
new
adversity
she
faced
the
weaker
her
heart
got
the
more
determined
she
was
to
exercise
whatever
it
took
to
make
it
strong
again
he
would
be
so
proud
of
the
way
you
pulled
citispace
back
from
the
brink
she
let
a
tear
slide
down
her
left
cheek
smearing
her
makeup
and
i
tell
you
something
else
young
lady
you
take
after
us
both
when
it
comes
to
guts
my
memory
may
be
slipping
but
i
remember
you
were
always
willing
to
take
chances
and
i
guess
that
what
doing
here
now
both
of
us
we
gambling
on
life
in
your
case
you
got
a
lot
to
lose
ally
looked
at
her
nina
was
having
one
of
her
moments
of
incredible
lucidity
but
how
did
she
know
so
much
about
what
was
really
going
on
mom
did
the
doctor
tell
you
what
i
the
head
nurse
ellen
told
me
that
you
going
to
undergo
a
procedure
for
your
heart
that
you
going
to
start
today
her
eyes
darkened
she
also
admitted
he
never
used
the
procedure
on
a
condition
like
yours
it
completely
experimental
you
talked
to
her
this
morning
she
took
me
downstairs
where
they
did
my
hair
she
said
vee
thinks
it
important
for
everyone
here
to
have
a
positive
attitude
they
ask
you
what
you
like
and
then
they
try
to
do
it
now
i
ready
for
whatever
comes
next
she
stared
directly
into
ally
eyes
but
that
does
mean
i
still
ca
be
nervous
about
all
this
untried
stuff
mom
do
worry
about
me
i
going
to
get
through
this
if
you
be
strong
for
me
i
promise
i
be
strong
for
you
she
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
from
this
vantage
she
could
just
see
the
lake
down
through
the
trees
they
were
starting
to
put
out
leaves
but
it
was
still
early
spring
and
nippy
here
so
they
mostly
had
just
buds
all
the
same
there
was
a
sense
of
renewal
about
them
which
made
her
think
of
her
own
body
life
is
so
bittersweet
nina
sighed
but
you
still
want
to
go
on
living
even
when
it
a
daily
struggle
either
i
an
optimist
or
pigheaded
you
just
wonderful
ally
said
that
what
you
are
she
glanced
down
at
her
watch
she
was
scheduled
to
meet
ellen
downstairs
at
ten
to
fill
out
the
paperwork
that
formally
entered
her
into
the
clinical
trials
if
she
decided
to
go
ahead
and
enroll
this
would
be
her
last
day
of
freedom
tomorrow
she
would
have
to
begin
the
intense
phase
of
the
therapy
did
she
really
want
to
do
that
she
wanted
to
talk
to
van
de
vliet
one
last
time
look
mom
going
to
be
downstairs
for
a
while
now
but
i
come
back
up
later
all
right
ellen
said
there
a
little
library
here
somewhere
so
i
may
go
down
and
look
i
might
even
get
something
in
spanish
to
try
and
keep
my
mind
alert
she
sighed
oh
ally
i
so
want
to
be
the
way
i
was
again
pray
for
me
ally
knew
prayer
was
something
her
mother
engaged
in
a
lot
in
fact
she
always
been
a
fervent
agnostic
what
had
brought
about
the
change
was
it
that
she
finally
discovered
that
both
her
body
and
mind
had
limits
and
would
do
what
she
wanted
forever
i
pray
for
us
both
mom
but
we
going
to
be
okay
i
have
faith
good
for
you
she
looked
away
i
try
to
have
it
too
ally
walked
over
and
kissed
her
then
turned
and
headed
out
the
door
where
was
this
all
going
to
end
she
had
absolutely
no
idea
but
with
nina
miracle
change
overnight
the
concern
she
heard
in
the
voice
of
stone
aimes
seemed
a
million
miles
away
as
she
walked
down
the
marble
stairs
she
tried
to
take
the
measure
of
the
place
the
dorian
institute
did
inspire
you
with
its
look
of
utter
perfection
it
was
an
appropriate
setting
for
miracles
when
she
got
to
the
lobby
she
saw
ellen
stepping
off
the
elevator
coming
up
from
the
basement
all
set
to
get
going
she
asked
walking
over
before
we
start
any
procedures
anything
at
all
we
got
to
fill
out
the
forms
for
the
nih
technically
what
is
going
on
here
is
a
clinical
trial
a
very
detailed
study
in
which
we
constantly
monitor
the
patients
and
try
to
measure
their
progress
objectively
so
we
have
to
take
some
time
and
establish
a
very
thorough
baseline
we
began
that
yesterday
when
you
went
to
the
clinic
in
new
york
for
a
stress
test
among
other
things
we
be
running
an
ekg
on
you
here
on
a
daily
basis
and
all
this
goes
into
my
nih
files
ally
asked
they
were
getting
on
the
elevator
to
go
down
not
the
raw
data
it
our
job
to
structure
our
patients
files
in
ways
that
will
permit
the
nih
monitor
or
other
third
parties
to
assess
our
results
quickly
they
were
getting
off
now
entering
the
starkly
lit
hallway
that
connected
the
laboratory
and
van
de
vliet
office
with
the
examination
rooms
vee
is
working
in
the
lab
this
morning
so
we
can
use
his
office
to
fill
out
all
the
forms
ally
could
see
van
de
vliet
and
three
other
people
members
of
his
research
team
all
dressed
in
white
clustered
around
a
blackboard
where
he
was
drawing
some
kind
of
flowchart
again
she
was
struck
by
his
youthful
appearance
he
surely
did
not
look
a
day
older
than
forty
or
tops
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
in
his
office
and
she
paused
to
look
around
as
was
usual
he
had
a
wall
of
framed
diplomas
and
certificates
from
her
cursory
checkout
they
seemed
to
correspond
to
the
educational
history
she
remembered
from
his
cv
it
was
a
spacious
room
with
an
executive
feeling
and
he
had
an
expensive
monitor
sitting
on
the
side
of
his
desk
next
to
it
was
a
wooden
table
and
chairs
a
pile
of
nih
forms
was
there
along
with
a
green
filled
with
ballpoint
pens
he
likes
to
let
people
use
his
office
whenever
possible
ellen
explained
it
a
lot
less
institutional
than
the
conference
room
ally
settled
at
the
table
and
picked
up
the
form
they
want
a
lot
of
personal
information
ellen
went
on
but
your
mother
and
i
filled
out
her
items
yesterday
and
it
was
too
hard
needless
to
say
all
personal
information
is
completely
confidential
even
your
name
after
the
first
week
we
only
identify
you
with
a
coding
system
as
ally
was
reaching
for
a
pen
a
petite
blond
woman
with
a
smashing
figure
strode
through
the
door
she
was
wearing
a
lab
coat
not
a
nurse
uniform
but
it
still
showed
off
her
curves
she
was
carrying
a
tray
containing
a
hypodermic
needle
and
three
glass
vials
hi
she
said
with
a
smile
i
connolly
welcome
to
the
dorian
institute
we
all
very
excited
about
having
you
here
deb
come
in
ellen
said
seeming
slightly
startled
is
there
something
we
forgot
to
no
i
just
need
to
take
one
hundred
fifty
milliliters
of
blood
got
to
get
started
on
the
cultures
we
be
using
asap
hang
on
a
second
ally
said
i
was
hoping
to
talk
this
over
a
bit
more
with
van
de
vliet
before
i
take
the
final
leap
you
free
to
dither
as
much
as
you
like
debra
connolly
said
her
smile
vanishing
but
our
programs
are
on
a
schedule
i
still
i
just
be
taking
a
small
amount
of
blood
we
can
then
get
started
on
the
cultures
while
you
talk
she
was
already
swabbing
ally
arm
and
feeling
for
a
vein
now
make
a
fist
ally
hated
giving
blood
and
to
distract
herself
she
glanced
around
the
office
trying
to
construct
a
life
story
for
karl
van
de
vliet
then
she
noticed
a
photo
of
him
and
a
woman
standing
together
on
a
bridge
next
to
a
sign
that
said
charles
river
which
meant
boston
and
they
were
holding
hands
and
smiling
the
odd
thing
was
the
cars
behind
them
were
models
at
least
fifteen
years
old
yet
he
looked
just
the
same
as
he
did
today
whoa
there
it
is
again
that
odd
age
thing
there
is
something
very
strange
about
this
man
she
finally
got
up
her
courage
to
ask
connolly
do
you
know
how
old
van
de
vliet
is
he
looks
so
young
there
are
some
things
it
not
polite
to
ask
she
was
capping
off
the
vial
and
reaching
for
a
second
her
voice
had
grown
genuinely
frosty
frankly
i
do
see
why
he
knows
everything
there
is
to
know
about
me
he
has
all
my
files
you
could
ask
at
the
front
desk
for
one
of
our
brochures
i
sure
it
would
clear
up
any
questions
you
have
she
attached
the
second
vial
to
the
needle
i
seen
it
i
know
when
he
went
to
school
and
all
that
but
still
if
you
really
want
to
know
personal
things
you
might
just
ask
him
yourself
you
two
seem
to
get
along
so
well
what
is
with
her
ally
puzzled
why
is
she
being
so
hostile
and
negative
and
why
that
little
jab
about
getting
along
the
truth
was
debra
connolly
could
have
been
a
runway
model
but
in
a
lab
coat
her
blondness
and
figure
just
intensified
her
bitchiness
okay
maybe
the
question
about
his
age
was
overly
relevant
more
a
matter
of
idle
curiosity
but
how
did
he
do
it
every
woman
alive
would
like
to
know
maybe
the
story
grant
had
told
about
van
de
vliet
and
his
experimental
skin
treatment
was
actually
true
she
had
put
much
stock
in
it
at
the
time
but
seeing
him
out
here
in
the
flesh
there
actually
something
else
i
was
curious
about
was
a
patient
dropped
from
the
trials
a
few
months
back
i
was
wondering
if
you
could
tell
me
anything
about
that
what
have
you
heard
that
would
make
you
ask
such
a
question
debra
connolly
face
went
blank
but
her
blue
eyes
registered
alarm
no
one
here
is
allowed
to
discuss
specific
cases
that
would
be
a
violation
of
nih
rules
and
highly
unethical
what
made
you
ask
that
question
hey
why
so
defensive
could
it
be
stone
is
on
to
something
that
needs
more
daylight
i
did
a
little
research
on
the
gerex
corporation
and
then
she
had
an
inspired
hunch
you
know
the
nih
has
a
web
site
where
they
post
all
the
clinical
trials
they
have
under
way
this
was
actually
something
she
knew
to
be
true
she
had
used
the
site
to
look
up
information
about
possible
clinical
trials
for
alzheimer
patients
that
might
accept
her
mother
but
she
never
could
find
any
in
the
new
york
area
that
seemed
to
offer
any
hope
so
naturally
your
study
was
there
i
like
to
know
as
much
as
i
can
about
what
i
getting
into
i
been
to
that
web
site
many
times
the
public
part
include
so
has
a
patient
ever
been
terminated
ally
cut
her
off
hoping
to
avoid
being
caught
in
a
lie
if
so
i
really
like
to
know
why
no
one
is
allowed
to
discuss
any
details
of
the
clinical
studies
she
was
capping
off
the
last
vial
of
blood
the
three
cylinders
of
red
against
the
steel
i
think
i
going
to
have
a
talk
with
van
de
vliet
before
i
go
any
further
with
this
program
ally
said
feeling
her
temper
and
her
warning
instincts
both
ratchet
up
i
feel
like
i
being
stonewalled
you
free
to
think
what
you
like
debra
connolly
had
turned
and
was
brusquely
heading
for
the
doorway
when
it
was
blocked
by
another
blonde
this
one
in
her
late
fifties
who
was
standing
in
the
threshold
and
brandishing
a
black
automatic
pistol
her
eyes
were
wild
the
security
guard
from
the
entrance
and
the
nurse
from
the
front
desk
upstairs
were
both
cowering
behind
her
where
kristen
she
demanded
where
my
daughter
i
know
alive
goddam
you
i
come
to
take
her
home
chapter
april
who
are
you
and
how
did
you
get
in
here
debra
connolly
demanded
backing
away
from
the
door
and
quickly
settling
her
steel
tray
onto
a
table
ally
got
the
instant
impression
that
deb
knew
exactly
who
she
was
the
woman
hair
was
an
ash
blond
tint
above
dark
roots
and
was
clipped
short
in
a
curt
style
her
troubled
face
had
stress
lines
and
her
heavy
makeup
reminded
ally
of
a
younger
sylvia
miles
or
perhaps
a
particularly
intense
real
estate
agent
except
that
real
estate
agents
do
charge
in
on
you
brandishing
a
beretta
it
all
been
a
lie
the
woman
declared
her
voice
shrill
if
she
recognized
debra
it
was
apparent
ellen
hit
a
button
on
the
desk
and
spoke
into
the
intercom
vee
could
you
please
come
to
your
office
immediately
it
an
emergency
there
someone
here
who
you
damned
right
it
an
emergency
the
woman
barked
at
her
had
you
better
give
me
the
gun
debra
asked
holding
out
her
hand
and
stepping
toward
her
the
woman
turned
and
trained
the
pistol
on
her
just
back
off
sister
and
keep
out
of
this
i
know
you
work
for
him
but
you
just
a
flunky
then
could
you
at
least
keep
your
voice
down
debra
connolly
said
her
composure
hard
as
ice
the
jab
had
bounced
right
off
underneath
the
beauty
pageant
exterior
she
was
all
steel
and
sinew
there
are
patients
upstairs
the
hapless
security
man
who
been
trailing
behind
the
woman
had
gone
over
to
the
door
of
the
laboratory
and
was
desperately
banging
on
the
glass
and
waving
for
van
de
vliet
a
moment
later
he
strode
out
still
wearing
his
white
lab
jacket
you
the
woman
hissed
turning
to
meet
him
you
the
one
who
has
her
you
and
that
bastard
bartlett
madam
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
he
said
warily
as
he
came
up
to
her
immediately
he
glanced
down
at
the
pistol
otherwise
i
have
to
call
the
police
although
he
was
giving
the
impression
that
the
woman
was
just
an
anonymous
annoyance
ally
was
sure
she
caught
a
glimmer
of
recognition
and
a
patina
of
poorly
disguised
panic
in
his
eyes
i
want
to
see
kristen
damn
you
i
want
to
know
what
you
done
with
her
to
her
you
and
that
bastard
winston
bartlett
who
got
her
into
kristen
he
seemed
puzzled
then
he
appeared
to
remember
there
was
a
patient
here
briefly
a
while
back
who
i
believe
was
named
kristen
starr
that
right
you
fucker
and
you
damned
well
do
remember
her
and
me
she
my
daughter
where
is
she
my
god
ally
thought
could
she
mean
that
kristen
starr
the
one
who
had
an
interview
show
on
cable
the
world
around
this
institute
just
keeps
getting
smaller
ally
had
actually
done
an
project
for
kristen
starr
back
when
she
was
first
getting
up
to
speed
at
citispace
it
was
one
of
her
first
jobs
at
that
time
kristen
had
just
signed
a
contract
with
e
and
she
wanted
to
renovate
her
in
chelsea
but
then
just
as
the
job
was
completed
she
sold
the
place
and
moved
to
a
brownstone
in
the
west
village
or
so
she
said
ally
did
know
why
she
had
done
it
or
where
precisely
she
had
moved
to
but
she
got
the
impression
some
very
rich
new
sugar
daddy
was
setting
her
up
and
he
wanted
the
privacy
of
a
town
house
could
it
be
that
kristen
was
the
mysterious
missing
patient
stone
was
trying
to
locate
and
interview
ally
had
seen
her
on
tv
for
a
while
so
maybe
she
had
moved
on
to
other
things
i
really
do
know
where
she
is
now
van
de
vliet
said
she
became
emotionally
unstable
in
the
middle
of
her
treatment
it
a
rarity
but
it
has
happened
she
checked
out
after
that
i
do
that
a
damned
lie
the
woman
declared
i
know
it
now
that
what
your
receptionists
have
been
telling
everybody
it
sounded
a
little
like
her
at
first
but
now
i
realize
it
preposterous
she
did
just
up
and
run
off
you
keeping
her
somewhere
where
is
she
where
my
only
child
wherever
she
is
i
can
assure
you
she
most
assuredly
not
here
van
de
vliet
intoned
smoothly
even
as
his
eyes
struggled
to
stay
calm
would
that
she
were
she
wanted
a
procedure
done
and
i
think
we
were
having
some
success
but
then
she
became
traumatized
for
some
reason
best
known
to
her
and
insisted
on
leaving
no
one
is
forced
to
complete
the
regimen
here
against
their
will
as
best
i
recall
someone
said
she
went
to
a
spa
in
new
mexico
i
know
that
what
your
flunkies
have
been
telling
me
over
the
phone
that
she
went
to
new
mexico
to
hide
out
but
now
i
know
everybody
lied
to
me
for
the
last
three
years
she
been
sleeping
with
that
bastard
winston
bartlett
but
now
his
office
wo
even
return
my
phone
calls
you
all
think
you
so
smart
but
i
could
smuggle
a
gun
past
your
guards
in
my
bra
her
eyes
had
acquired
a
further
kind
of
wildness
now
as
she
awkwardly
began
opening
her
purse
hanging
from
a
shoulder
strap
with
her
left
hand
while
still
holding
the
pistol
in
her
right
and
i
got
a
letter
from
her
just
this
morning
the
postmark
is
new
york
city
so
what
van
de
vliet
eyes
began
to
blink
rapidly
she
not
in
new
mexico
now
if
she
ever
was
the
woman
waved
a
small
tan
envelope
at
him
there
was
large
loopy
writing
on
the
outside
could
could
i
see
that
he
started
to
reach
for
it
but
she
waved
the
black
beretta
at
him
and
shoved
the
letter
back
into
her
purse
no
you
ca
what
you
is
tell
me
where
the
hell
keeping
her
now
before
we
proceed
any
further
that
gun
really
is
necessary
van
de
vliet
said
as
he
reached
and
deftly
seized
her
wrist
he
was
quick
and
his
quickness
seemed
to
spook
her
because
just
as
he
turned
the
pistol
away
it
discharged
the
round
went
astray
ricocheting
off
a
metal
lighting
fixture
at
the
end
of
the
hallway
and
into
the
wall
the
hapless
unarmed
guard
followed
her
downstairs
yelled
and
dived
behind
a
large
potted
corn
plant
near
the
office
door
both
ellen
and
debra
connolly
just
stared
momentarily
too
stunned
to
move
ally
stepped
toward
the
woman
wanting
to
help
van
de
vliet
disarm
her
she
was
feeling
her
heart
race
dangerously
upward
van
de
vliet
was
still
struggling
with
the
woman
when
the
beretta
discharged
again
this
time
it
was
aimed
downward
at
the
hard
tile
floor
and
the
ricochet
was
not
so
harmless
the
round
bounced
back
and
caught
the
woman
in
the
chest
knocking
her
sideways
van
de
vliet
unsuccessfully
grabbed
for
her
as
she
crumpled
ally
reached
for
her
too
but
by
that
time
she
was
already
on
the
floor
ally
pulled
the
hot
pistol
from
her
fingers
then
turned
and
handed
it
to
ellen
here
for
god
sake
do
something
with
this
she
realized
she
had
never
actually
held
a
real
pistol
before
blood
was
flowing
across
the
floor
as
van
de
vliet
and
debra
connolly
began
tearing
open
the
woman
blouse
the
bullet
appeared
to
have
entered
her
chest
just
below
the
rib
cage
a
jagged
wound
caused
by
the
projectile
tumble
and
splattered
shape
and
then
exited
a
few
inches
away
at
her
side
she
had
passed
out
get
a
gurney
now
he
yelled
to
ellen
we
got
to
get
her
into
or
one
and
try
to
do
something
about
the
bleeding
my
god
ally
marveled
what
desperation
drove
her
to
threaten
him
with
a
gun
when
she
obviously
did
know
the
first
thing
about
how
to
use
it
the
woman
open
purse
was
lying
no
more
than
two
feet
from
where
she
had
fallen
with
the
hallway
rapidly
filling
as
nurses
from
upstairs
poured
off
the
elevator
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
anything
but
the
prostrate
woman
get
the
letter
ally
she
gingerly
moved
over
to
where
the
purse
was
resting
and
peeked
in
there
was
a
jumble
of
the
usual
things
cosmetics
a
ballpoint
a
change
purse
an
address
book
and
a
billfold
there
also
was
the
tan
envelope
yes
the
scene
in
the
hallway
was
increasingly
chaotic
two
of
the
researchers
from
the
laboratory
had
come
out
in
their
sterile
whites
with
disinfectant
and
a
roll
of
bandages
as
they
began
to
bind
her
wound
to
stanch
the
bleeding
her
eyelids
fluttered
and
she
groaned
she
just
in
shock
van
de
vliet
said
with
relief
ellen
page
michael
and
tell
him
to
bring
the
ambulance
around
front
just
in
case
but
i
think
we
can
handle
this
here
now
two
nurses
were
rolling
a
gurney
off
the
elevator
while
van
de
vliet
and
the
two
lab
researchers
lifted
her
onto
it
ally
realized
that
nobody
seemed
to
think
that
calling
the
police
about
any
of
this
would
be
a
constructive
step
she
pulled
out
the
letter
and
examined
it
the
oversize
script
on
the
front
read
katherine
starr
east
st
there
was
no
return
address
katherine
starr
she
was
repeating
the
name
and
address
trying
to
lodge
them
in
her
memory
while
she
was
pulling
the
letter
out
of
the
tan
envelope
it
was
in
the
same
rotund
script
as
the
address
whoever
you
are
i
think
you
my
mother
but
i
not
sure
please
help
me
i
know
where
i
am
or
what
my
name
is
but
i
found
a
bracelet
with
starr
on
it
and
i
looked
in
the
phone
book
your
name
sounded
kind
of
familiar
i
think
i
i
better
take
that
van
de
vliet
said
lifting
the
letter
out
of
ally
hands
all
her
personal
effects
should
be
kept
with
her
vee
or
one
is
open
ellen
was
saying
as
she
marched
down
the
hall
toward
them
debra
has
the
iv
and
oxygen
ready
good
he
said
glancing
at
her
for
a
second
as
he
did
ally
reached
into
katherine
starr
purse
and
palmed
the
small
black
address
book
then
van
de
vliet
turned
back
to
her
let
me
see
about
her
bleeding
and
then
i
try
to
explain
i
now
remember
this
woman
all
too
well
it
all
coming
back
like
a
bad
dream
i
repressed
i
pegged
her
as
schizophrenic
the
minute
i
saw
her
when
she
came
here
and
tried
to
talk
her
daughter
into
leaving
she
paranoid
and
what
was
kristen
starr
here
for
ally
asked
i
actually
did
an
job
for
her
a
few
years
back
and
she
never
mentioned
any
health
issues
actually
nothing
he
declared
quickly
she
was
having
an
early
midlife
crisis
i
gather
she
had
some
kind
of
television
program
and
her
contract
was
renewed
she
decided
it
was
because
of
her
appearance
he
shrugged
and
gestured
with
empty
palms
iike
how
absurd
but
that
the
way
some
women
are
it
turned
out
we
had
a
mutual
acquaintance
who
told
her
about
the
stem
cell
procedure
here
at
the
institute
when
he
brought
her
in
i
was
in
a
position
to
turn
her
away
that
would
be
winston
bartlett
by
any
chance
he
nodded
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
writes
the
checks
so
he
has
a
certain
amount
of
influence
around
here
as
it
happened
i
had
experimented
with
a
procedure
some
years
ago
involving
stem
cells
and
the
epidermis
there
seemed
to
be
a
regenerative
effect
and
i
thought
there
was
a
reasonable
chance
she
might
respond
to
it
since
we
had
clinical
trials
for
other
stem
cell
procedures
already
under
way
it
was
easy
to
fit
her
in
but
i
had
a
lot
more
important
things
going
on
at
the
time
than
her
cosmetic
work
so
i
did
pay
much
attention
to
her
then
she
abruptly
left
and
since
then
i
had
so
much
else
happening
i
just
have
thought
about
her
was
it
not
working
is
that
why
she
left
some
of
the
staff
swore
it
was
having
results
the
truth
is
i
following
her
very
closely
in
my
honest
opinion
stem
cell
technology
should
be
used
for
cosmetic
purposes
it
borders
on
the
obscene
whoa
ally
thought
according
to
grant
you
experimented
with
a
procedure
for
the
skin
on
yourself
and
you
got
the
skin
to
prove
it
let
not
have
the
pot
calling
the
kettle
black
here
but
if
it
was
working
then
why
did
she
decide
to
stop
this
story
sounds
way
too
pat
she
thought
you
have
to
ask
someone
closer
to
her
maybe
she
did
think
it
was
how
about
winston
bartlett
i
gather
he
pretty
close
well
she
a
touchy
subject
with
him
good
luck
van
de
vliet
hesitated
and
his
face
flushed
but
now
i
really
have
to
get
in
there
i
responsible
for
whatever
happens
around
here
particularly
whatever
bad
that
happens
he
was
heading
down
the
hall
one
last
thing
if
kristen
is
here
in
new
york
then
how
could
i
contact
her
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
he
said
over
his
shoulder
if
her
own
mother
could
find
actually
you
might
check
with
the
front
desk
all
clinical
trial
participants
are
here
under
a
confidentiality
agreement
which
means
that
giving
out
any
information
about
her
would
be
a
liability
issue
but
now
see
if
they
have
a
prior
address
they
can
give
you
after
she
left
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
pursue
her
he
was
going
through
a
door
marked
or
but
then
he
revolved
back
there
was
a
darkness
in
his
eyes
she
had
seen
before
i
guess
wondering
why
exactly
you
so
interested
in
this
deranged
girl
it
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
your
own
treatment
it
just
something
i
curious
about
she
stopped
her
emotions
in
a
jumble
what
is
going
on
you
know
i
wondering
if
maybe
we
should
start
my
procedure
later
in
the
week
all
this
guns
and
shooting
is
a
bit
much
for
me
to
take
in
she
looked
at
him
i
guess
i
ca
remember
ever
seeing
anyone
pull
a
pistol
on
their
doctor
before
i
can
understand
your
disquiet
he
said
his
eyes
dimming
even
more
but
i
really
hoped
we
could
get
started
today
i
should
be
free
in
an
hour
or
so
and
we
can
i
given
the
blood
sample
you
wanted
but
i
just
had
the
fright
of
my
life
i
want
to
go
up
and
see
mom
again
and
then
i
want
a
day
to
recharge
get
hold
of
stone
she
was
thinking
and
then
try
to
find
kristen
something
feels
very
here
just
be
aware
he
went
on
that
this
procedure
ca
wait
forever
i
told
you
that
we
have
less
than
three
weeks
left
at
the
end
of
the
month
the
clinical
trials
will
be
completed
and
this
facility
could
be
temporarily
closed
because
of
corporate
restructuring
what
is
he
talking
about
corporate
restructuring
you
pressuring
me
again
she
thought
i
really
do
like
that
it
can
wait
for
a
day
all
right
if
you
must
but
that
it
we
have
to
start
tomorrow
seriously
he
came
back
and
reached
and
took
her
hand
this
means
a
lot
to
me
alexa
i
really
want
to
help
you
and
i
truly
think
we
can
with
that
he
turned
and
walked
into
the
or
she
stood
watching
for
a
moment
and
when
he
was
definitely
gone
she
took
the
small
black
leather
volume
out
of
her
waistband
on
a
hunch
she
opened
it
to
the
first
page
and
sure
enough
there
it
was
penciled
in
down
one
side
kristy
no
last
name
and
no
address
the
rest
of
the
book
had
only
a
dozen
entries
so
few
that
ally
wondered
why
katherine
starr
bothered
carrying
it
compulsive
maybe
she
could
wait
to
get
to
her
car
and
get
on
the
phone
to
stone
kristen
starr
could
well
be
the
mystery
patient
he
was
looking
for
in
any
event
she
was
missing
freaked
out
unsure
who
she
was
and
probably
in
a
lot
of
trouble
but
now
they
had
a
phone
number
chapter
april
you
think
you
got
stone
aimes
sounded
like
he
just
won
the
lottery
for
the
patient
who
was
my
god
ally
you
incredible
possibly
but
what
i
know
i
am
is
very
worried
for
one
thing
if
this
is
the
person
you
looking
for
the
one
who
got
dropped
from
the
trials
it
somebody
you
probably
heard
of
and
for
another
just
had
a
series
of
very
disturbing
experiences
she
called
him
on
her
cell
phone
the
minute
she
cranked
up
her
toyota
to
return
to
the
city
she
could
get
away
from
the
dorian
institute
fast
enough
after
leaving
karl
van
de
vliet
she
taken
the
elevator
up
to
the
second
floor
to
check
in
on
nina
what
all
the
excitement
her
mother
had
asked
one
of
the
nurses
just
told
me
that
a
deranged
woman
with
a
gun
barged
into
the
lobby
looking
for
vee
then
she
shot
herself
it
nothing
mom
everything
is
all
right
now
she
had
wanted
to
upset
nina
but
she
was
convinced
karl
van
de
vliet
had
just
done
some
major
lying
his
uneasy
body
language
told
her
he
knew
a
lot
more
about
kristen
starr
than
he
was
admitting
for
that
matter
debra
connolly
probably
did
too
well
thank
goodness
nina
had
said
are
you
going
to
start
the
procedure
for
your
heart
today
not
yet
i
want
another
day
to
think
about
it
but
tell
me
how
doing
really
i
mean
are
you
comfortable
with
how
everything
going
here
you
can
still
stop
if
things
do
feel
right
ally
half
wanted
to
get
her
out
of
the
dorian
institute
immediately
she
did
know
what
either
of
them
had
stumbled
into
she
just
knew
now
that
along
with
the
possibility
of
miracles
the
dorian
institute
had
a
lot
of
questions
that
needed
straight
answers
she
no
longer
trusted
karl
van
de
vliet
she
had
seen
his
facade
crack
momentarily
and
what
lay
beneath
it
made
her
very
uncomfortable
furthermore
she
thought
he
realized
she
knew
he
was
lying
and
it
seemed
to
make
him
even
more
desperate
to
keep
her
there
ally
what
a
silly
thing
to
say
of
course
i
want
to
stay
fluffed
up
her
pillow
and
reached
for
the
tv
remote
some
of
the
smoke
has
already
been
blown
out
of
my
mind
i
feeling
clearer
by
the
minute
there
surely
got
to
be
some
placebo
effect
at
work
here
ally
thought
but
still
she
does
seem
more
aware
okay
mom
i
going
back
into
the
city
now
but
i
be
here
tomorrow
and
every
day
to
check
on
you
just
do
do
let
them
do
anything
to
you
that
seems
strange
with
that
she
had
given
nina
a
kiss
on
the
forehead
and
taken
the
marble
stairs
down
to
the
reception
it
was
now
time
to
find
kristen
starr
the
nurse
at
the
desk
was
a
woman
named
may
gooden
the
main
floor
had
returned
to
normal
after
all
the
excitement
with
patients
passing
through
as
they
came
back
from
the
cafeteria
ally
had
decided
to
try
a
long
shot
and
see
if
she
could
pry
out
any
information
about
kristen
from
the
patient
files
she
asked
blank
i
guess
van
de
vliet
was
not
aware
of
the
legal
strictures
in
our
nih
agreement
may
had
said
no
personal
information
can
be
released
without
a
patient
signed
authorization
you
do
remember
her
being
here
though
kristen
starr
my
lord
that
not
something
that
goes
unnoticed
she
had
an
assumed
name
but
everybody
knew
who
she
was
a
nice
girl
nicer
than
expect
from
seeing
her
on
television
so
when
exactly
did
she
leave
surely
you
can
tell
me
that
harmless
piece
of
information
it
was
several
months
ago
right
may
got
a
strange
look
in
her
eyes
who
told
you
that
i
i
was
downstairs
when
her
mother
showed
up
i
just
got
the
impression
that
it
was
may
glanced
furtively
around
i
should
be
telling
you
this
but
the
truth
is
i
think
she
was
still
here
until
just
a
few
days
ago
she
was
down
in
intensive
care
no
nursing
staff
is
allowed
down
there
just
those
people
he
has
working
for
him
what
some
of
the
nurses
call
the
gang
of
four
but
they
brought
her
up
in
the
elevator
and
then
an
ambulance
took
her
away
when
precisely
was
i
said
too
much
already
she
glanced
around
again
and
i
can
assure
you
that
kristen
did
sign
an
authorization
to
give
out
her
personal
information
she
abruptly
turned
frosty
and
officious
as
though
rethinking
how
open
she
just
been
what
was
she
afraid
of
now
if
you
excuse
me
i
got
some
things
i
need
to
do
ally
had
nodded
and
thanked
her
and
split
thus
the
search
had
already
produced
an
interesting
factoid
karl
van
de
vliet
was
most
assuredly
engaged
in
the
practice
of
a
big
lie
about
kristen
maybe
you
should
start
by
telling
me
about
the
disturbing
experience
stone
was
saying
as
the
shadows
of
the
trees
that
lined
the
leafy
driveway
glided
past
the
toyota
windshield
she
told
him
about
katherine
starr
and
kristen
starr
she
also
told
him
the
disparate
versions
of
kristen
departure
as
recounted
by
van
de
vliet
and
may
gooden
sounds
like
they
got
a
situation
stone
declared
they
trying
to
hide
somebody
who
well
known
but
you
got
a
number
like
i
said
i
palmed
katherine
little
black
book
and
it
got
what
could
be
the
last
known
phone
number
for
kristen
since
she
probably
left
the
institute
in
an
ambulance
a
few
days
ago
i
doubt
if
she
at
that
number
now
but
it
someplace
to
start
i
assume
the
area
code
is
there
reverse
directories
where
you
can
find
the
address
for
a
phone
number
right
in
fact
i
think
there
a
site
on
the
web
that
leave
that
part
to
me
if
the
number
still
good
i
have
it
in
five
minutes
then
i
call
you
back
and
maybe
you
could
meet
me
there
assuming
it
somewhere
in
the
city
just
give
me
your
cell
number
she
did
and
then
clicked
off
the
handset
my
god
she
thought
that
the
first
time
i
given
my
number
to
a
man
not
a
business
acquaintance
since
steve
died
okay
there
were
dinners
with
a
couple
of
bachelor
clients
that
turned
out
to
be
more
than
dinner
but
neither
relationship
had
lasted
past
a
month
both
the
men
nice
guys
had
complained
she
was
there
for
them
she
was
and
had
broken
it
off
she
meditated
on
that
as
she
went
through
the
iron
gates
which
opened
automatically
and
headed
down
the
leafy
twisting
roadway
leading
to
the
expressway
she
also
found
herself
wondering
what
stone
aimes
was
really
like
there
was
an
openness
now
that
made
her
feel
comfortable
though
maybe
that
was
just
his
deceptive
reporter
manner
his
calculating
way
of
getting
below
her
radar
he
definitely
picked
up
a
few
social
skills
over
the
past
years
god
knows
he
needed
them
whatever
was
going
on
it
was
good
to
have
him
around
again
there
was
something
different
about
talking
to
him
than
talking
to
jennifer
though
ally
was
quite
sure
what
it
was
and
she
was
afraid
to
think
too
hard
about
it
but
whatever
that
difference
it
was
one
of
the
million
reasons
she
so
missed
having
steve
around
because
if
there
ever
was
a
time
when
she
needed
somebody
to
talk
to
why
am
i
thinking
all
this
she
chided
herself
i
trying
to
psychoanalyze
him
and
put
him
in
a
category
when
i
do
know
the
first
thing
about
what
he
actually
turned
into
after
all
this
time
is
all
the
warmth
and
sincerity
for
real
back
in
the
old
days
he
make
nice
whenever
the
stakes
were
low
but
then
when
he
had
something
on
the
line
he
push
as
hard
as
he
needed
to
get
what
he
wanted
well
she
reminded
herself
i
that
way
too
that
was
part
of
our
problem
the
phone
beeped
voila
stone
voice
announced
i
got
an
address
in
the
west
village
it
west
eleventh
street
the
phone
is
unlisted
but
it
billed
to
her
name
so
you
were
right
about
the
number
and
get
this
it
had
been
turned
off
so
i
thought
idiot
why
do
you
do
the
obvious
and
just
try
calling
but
her
mother
said
she
disappeared
well
that
highly
plausible
there
an
answering
machine
there
with
a
very
strange
message
it
does
give
a
name
but
it
a
voice
and
it
like
a
de
she
away
but
she
quote
say
where
you
should
listen
to
it
greenwood
lake
road
had
now
become
skyline
drive
for
no
discernible
reason
and
the
traffic
was
picking
up
ally
put
on
some
speed
and
passed
a
truck
i
do
that
but
we
do
actually
know
for
sure
if
it
the
same
kristen
starr
though
it
surely
has
to
be
did
you
recognize
her
voice
i
never
watched
her
cable
show
i
just
sort
of
know
who
she
is
but
you
better
listen
to
her
announcement
how
could
there
be
two
young
women
named
kristen
starr
in
the
same
town
even
if
it
is
new
york
i
listen
it
got
to
be
her
though
give
me
the
address
she
hesitated
a
moment
after
he
did
then
would
you
like
to
meet
me
there
i
think
i
could
probably
make
it
in
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
a
quarter
to
be
safe
we
could
ask
around
see
if
anybody
in
her
building
or
the
neighborhood
has
any
idea
what
going
on
with
her
maybe
seen
her
i
was
supposed
to
head
into
the
office
but
nothing
could
keep
me
away
he
declared
with
enthusiasm
a
patrol
car
was
speeding
by
in
the
opposite
direction
siren
blaring
she
waited
for
the
noise
to
subside
great
i
try
for
an
hour
unless
the
traffic
really
gets
crazy
you
never
know
what
to
expect
at
the
gw
bridge
even
in
the
middle
of
the
day
she
clicked
off
the
phone
then
checked
the
number
in
the
front
of
the
black
address
book
and
punched
it
in
the
phone
rang
twice
and
then
an
answering
machine
started
the
voice
making
the
announcement
sounded
thin
tiny
and
fragile
just
hanging
on
it
was
the
verbal
equivalent
of
the
loopy
handwriting
on
the
letter
a
transparent
attempt
to
bolster
nonexistent
courage
hi
i
away
for
now
i
ca
say
where
and
i
not
sure
when
i
be
back
but
you
can
leave
a
message
or
whatever
in
case
i
get
a
chance
to
pick
them
up
at
some
point
or
you
do
have
to
that
okay
too
what
an
odd
thing
to
say
ally
thought
it
like
she
s
trying
not
to
sound
too
needful
but
it
was
definitely
the
kristen
starr
the
slightly
ditzy
tone
was
right
there
next
came
a
long
series
of
beeps
as
the
machine
proceeded
to
rewind
this
is
surreal
she
thought
i
about
to
leave
a
message
for
a
person
who
while
the
machine
beeped
she
tried
to
rehearse
what
she
wanted
to
say
to
make
it
as
as
possible
finally
the
machine
stopped
rewinding
kristen
hi
my
name
is
ally
hampton
you
may
remember
i
did
an
job
for
you
when
you
lived
in
chelsea
citispace
i
just
met
your
mother
she
got
your
letter
should
i
tell
her
about
the
gun
accident
ally
wondered
no
she
enough
already
your
real
name
is
kristen
starr
you
seemed
a
little
confused
about
that
in
your
letter
to
her
which
i
read
part
of
you
been
at
the
dorian
institute
in
new
jersey
listen
it
really
important
to
me
and
to
your
mother
that
you
get
in
touch
i
like
to
help
you
if
i
can
because
from
what
i
saw
of
your
letter
anyway
let
me
give
you
my
cell
phone
number
if
you
pick
this
up
you
can
call
me
anytime
night
or
day
it
how
did
you
get
this
number
a
frightened
voice
burst
through
ally
recognized
it
though
it
was
nothing
like
the
one
she
remembered
from
the
confident
brassy
tv
personality
that
kristen
used
to
be
i
just
got
away
and
came
here
and
right
after
i
got
here
someone
called
my
machine
and
then
hung
up
are
you
tracking
me
who
are
you
i
ally
was
so
startled
she
could
think
of
anything
to
say
immediately
kristen
is
that
you
i
just
saw
your
mother
i
got
this
number
from
her
she
came
out
to
the
dorian
institute
looking
for
you
she
very
worried
about
you
lying
to
me
you
trying
to
trick
me
and
get
me
back
she
was
breathing
heavily
as
though
she
just
run
a
set
of
stairs
this
is
a
person
just
barely
holding
it
together
ally
thought
anyway
kristen
is
not
my
name
my
name
is
kirby
they
wrote
it
down
for
me
and
i
very
confused
i
found
a
bracelet
in
my
suitcase
that
had
on
it
maybe
that
my
last
name
it
sounds
right
but
i
remember
you
do
remember
having
a
show
on
cable
i
i
think
i
knew
someone
who
had
a
tv
show
but
i
do
think
it
was
me
kirby
or
whatever
your
listen
carefully
i
think
you
were
undergoing
an
experimental
procedure
for
your
skin
at
a
place
in
new
jersey
called
the
dorian
institute
the
doctor
was
karl
van
de
vliet
you
were
in
clinical
trials
for
the
national
institutes
of
health
then
something
happened
and
you
left
do
you
remember
why
you
left
or
when
no
she
stifled
a
sob
i
ca
remember
anything
ally
took
a
deep
breath
not
liking
the
vibes
she
was
getting
do
you
want
to
talk
about
it
no
i
do
want
to
talk
to
you
or
to
anybody
i
got
out
of
that
place
and
place
ally
asked
she
was
being
passed
by
a
huge
bus
and
she
could
barely
hear
you
mean
the
institute
you
know
where
i
mean
and
do
come
looking
for
me
down
here
either
because
i
not
going
to
be
here
jesus
ally
thought
what
with
her
kris
kirby
i
not
connected
with
anybody
at
the
dorian
institute
i
supposed
to
become
a
patient
there
myself
i
just
trying
to
find
out
what
happened
to
you
when
you
underwent
your
treatment
there
i
can
only
remember
little
things
she
was
moaning
there
was
this
man
he
said
i
could
have
anything
i
wanted
i
trusted
him
and
now
i
see
faces
but
i
ca
remember
who
kristen
that
your
real
name
by
the
way
can
we
meet
i
promise
you
wo
be
harmed
i
just
you
do
understand
do
you
you
do
know
what
happening
to
me
her
voice
had
begun
to
break
it
the
beta
i
do
know
how
long
it
going
to
be
before
before
what
what
beta
what
are
you
kristen
really
got
to
meet
i
mean
it
i
desperately
need
to
talk
to
you
maybe
we
could
find
another
doctor
if
that
what
you
need
could
i
come
down
i
have
no
idea
who
you
are
you
could
be
he
says
they
trying
to
help
me
but
i
not
getting
any
better
ally
was
pulling
onto
the
interstate
heading
south
it
was
hard
to
concentrate
on
driving
but
at
the
same
time
she
wanted
to
push
the
speed
limit
kristen
sounded
like
she
was
getting
ready
to
disintegrate
or
flee
then
she
had
another
thought
kristen
it
okay
if
you
do
trust
me
but
could
you
tell
me
more
about
your
side
effects
are
they
i
think
that
why
he
moved
me
to
that
place
but
then
he
she
was
growing
even
more
agitated
and
impatient
look
i
really
talk
anymore
i
losing
her
ally
thought
try
to
make
her
hang
on
kristen
would
you
please
take
my
phone
number
you
sound
like
you
could
use
a
friend
oh
christ
i
so
scared
i
do
just
take
it
no
harm
then
if
something
happens
and
you
want
to
all
right
she
said
finally
me
and
i
write
it
down
ally
gave
it
to
her
then
added
i
run
an
firm
i
actually
did
some
work
for
you
once
so
we
met
you
can
call
my
office
so
let
me
give
you
that
number
too
no
way
am
i
connected
to
the
institute
where
you
were
she
said
she
was
writing
it
down
you
know
kristen
went
on
i
think
this
is
god
way
of
punishing
me
for
wanting
something
nobody
should
have
then
she
began
to
sob
again
how
exactly
i
found
a
door
that
was
locked
and
i
just
came
here
i
do
know
what
guided
me
and
when
i
got
to
this
street
i
knew
exactly
which
building
it
was
there
was
no
name
on
my
bell
or
anything
but
i
knew
i
even
knew
who
had
my
emergency
key
it
like
i
have
a
sense
memory
of
this
apartment
but
i
ca
remember
ever
actually
living
here
your
name
is
kristen
starr
ally
said
again
try
to
remember
that
and
will
you
please
stay
there
till
i
can
get
there
and
talk
to
you
then
she
made
what
she
immediately
realized
was
a
fatal
mistake
there
a
reporter
a
sweet
guy
who
doing
a
book
about
a
medical
procedure
at
the
clinic
where
you
were
and
he
dying
to
talk
to
anybody
who
been
part
of
the
clinical
trials
there
could
he
talk
to
you
too
it
sounds
like
you
got
quite
a
story
to
tell
you
got
to
be
kidding
if
they
find
me
i
do
know
what
do
and
the
connection
was
severed
shit
do
do
this
she
quickly
tried
the
cell
phone
number
for
stone
aimes
it
me
again
listen
she
actually
there
kristen
in
the
apartment
on
west
eleventh
street
i
just
got
off
the
phone
with
her
she
the
one
you
want
but
she
like
a
frightened
rabbit
she
said
she
was
about
to
leave
but
if
you
get
there
soon
you
might
be
able
to
catch
her
damn
we
stuck
in
traffic
at
street
there
was
a
fender
bender
on
lex
but
i
get
there
as
soon
as
i
can
okay
maybe
get
your
driver
to
try
fifth
good
idea
she
clicked
off
and
stared
at
the
road
the
george
washington
bridge
was
just
ahead
if
she
broke
the
speed
limit
once
she
hit
the
west
side
highway
and
caught
the
lights
right
she
might
even
beat
stone
there
chapter
april
we
got
a
problem
karl
van
de
vliet
said
into
the
microphone
he
was
in
his
private
office
on
the
scrambled
videophone
kristen
mother
showed
up
just
before
noon
with
a
pistol
demanding
to
know
where
she
was
when
i
tried
to
take
the
gun
away
from
her
she
accidentally
shot
herself
through
the
side
fortunately
it
was
only
a
flesh
wound
but
it
took
us
almost
an
hour
to
stabilize
her
christ
even
kristy
thinks
she
crazy
why
did
she
kristen
smuggled
her
a
letter
somehow
and
she
came
looking
for
her
he
thought
about
how
they
should
be
having
this
conversation
on
any
kind
of
phone
even
one
that
was
supposedly
scrambled
but
there
was
no
choice
it
gets
worse
i
just
called
park
and
they
checked
her
room
and
kristen
not
there
she
was
there
when
roxanne
brought
up
her
breakfast
at
nine
but
nobody
seen
her
since
they
assumed
she
gone
back
to
sleep
nobody
there
has
any
idea
where
she
went
shit
what
am
i
paying
them
for
the
staff
is
there
for
the
sole
purpose
of
making
sure
something
like
this
did
happen
well
that
your
part
of
the
show
i
just
trying
to
practice
medicine
in
any
case
she
slipped
out
somehow
so
the
thing
now
is
where
did
she
go
well
she
did
come
here
or
at
least
she
has
yet
depending
on
how
much
she
can
still
remember
she
might
have
gone
to
her
old
place
down
in
the
village
maybe
she
still
has
a
homing
instinct
probably
the
first
location
we
ought
to
check
jesus
if
she
gets
recognized
and
starts
acting
crazy
and
then
cambridge
pharmaceuticals
finds
out
the
bigger
problem
now
could
be
her
mother
katherine
you
know
her
she
unbalanced
but
she
also
still
remembers
how
it
all
started
she
was
actually
here
a
couple
of
times
if
she
sees
kristen
then
god
help
us
karl
i
got
everything
and
i
do
mean
everything
riding
on
this
what
happened
with
that
hampton
woman
you
got
to
get
started
with
her
is
she
on
board
yet
or
what
she
was
here
this
morning
but
she
got
temporarily
spooked
by
the
gun
and
the
craziness
she
be
back
though
when
i
took
care
of
it
trust
me
van
de
vliet
declared
in
the
meantime
i
try
to
maintain
kristen
mother
under
sedation
as
long
as
possible
but
we
ca
keep
her
out
of
touch
forever
that
would
be
flirting
with
kidnapping
i
send
ken
over
to
west
eleventh
street
to
check
out
her
place
bartlett
said
if
she
there
he
get
her
and
he
signed
off
the
image
on
the
computer
going
dark
van
de
vliet
felt
a
wave
of
apprehension
every
day
it
got
worse
would
any
of
the
other
patients
develop
the
syndrome
or
was
its
development
unique
to
the
beta
kristen
had
agreed
of
her
own
free
will
to
undergo
the
beta
and
been
warned
that
any
experimental
procedure
involved
significant
risk
she
signed
release
documents
absolving
gerex
of
any
liability
but
when
treatments
go
awry
patients
tend
not
to
recall
the
releases
they
signed
undoubtedly
she
now
conveniently
forgotten
that
fact
assuming
she
still
remembered
anything
time
to
go
back
to
the
or
and
see
how
katherine
was
doing
if
she
seemed
completely
stabilized
and
coherent
she
could
be
moved
down
to
the
area
in
the
floor
below
the
subbasement
that
way
absolutely
nobody
could
get
to
her
he
clicked
off
the
computer
and
walked
back
to
the
or
karl
she
awake
david
said
as
he
walked
in
he
been
monitoring
her
it
probably
okay
to
move
her
thank
god
van
de
vliet
thought
maybe
there
some
way
to
reason
with
her
rationally
he
moved
over
and
looked
down
her
hair
was
soaked
with
sweat
and
she
looked
very
very
tired
starr
can
you
understand
me
i
van
de
vliet
i
need
to
talk
to
you
about
your
daughter
kristen
who
who
are
you
she
mumbled
her
eyes
trying
to
focus
i
kristen
physician
she
came
to
see
me
some
months
back
do
you
recall
about
her
skin
problem
i
seem
to
remember
you
came
here
with
her
at
one
point
she
stared
at
him
mutely
for
a
moment
then
closed
her
eyes
and
nodded
at
that
time
starr
we
discussed
some
radical
treatment
options
things
that
had
been
tried
before
do
you
have
any
recollection
of
that
she
opened
her
eyes
again
and
stared
at
him
trying
to
focus
you
said
she
be
all
right
she
mumbled
slurring
the
words
then
your
receptionist
told
me
she
gone
to
new
mexico
but
i
got
a
letter
that
story
was
to
protect
her
professionally
he
lied
she
was
afraid
the
press
might
find
out
she
was
here
and
start
speculating
about
her
health
but
now
she
in
the
phase
of
treatment
it
may
be
a
while
longer
before
she
able
to
return
to
the
normal
life
she
used
to
she
okay
is
she
came
a
plaintive
slurred
mumble
in
her
letter
it
sounded
like
she
lost
her
memory
or
something
she
sound
right
it
was
a
question
that
cut
him
to
the
core
starr
i
think
we
should
focus
on
you
right
now
you
had
a
traumatic
episode
and
you
injured
yourself
pretty
seriously
you
may
have
to
stay
here
at
the
institute
for
a
few
days
so
we
can
take
care
of
you
he
took
her
hand
which
felt
deathly
cold
tell
me
is
there
anyone
we
should
notify
of
your
whereabouts
so
they
wo
be
alarmed
there
an
address
book
in
my
purse
her
eyelids
flickered
those
are
all
people
i
close
to
i
just
want
to
sleep
i
ca
think
now
good
he
thought
the
sedative
is
finally
kicking
in
all
right
you
need
your
rest
we
talk
about
this
later
he
turned
and
picked
up
the
purse
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
but
when
he
searched
inside
he
did
see
an
address
book
where
was
it
he
wondered
alexa
hampton
had
started
reading
kristen
letter
which
probably
was
part
of
the
reason
she
got
uneasy
did
she
make
off
with
the
address
book
but
why
it
did
matter
she
would
be
back
if
debra
had
done
what
she
was
supposed
to
do
david
have
starr
taken
downstairs
i
need
to
see
deb
you
got
it
van
de
vliet
went
down
the
hall
and
then
through
the
heavy
steel
air
lock
and
into
the
laboratory
deb
can
i
have
a
word
with
you
he
motioned
for
her
to
follow
him
to
the
computer
cubicle
in
the
back
past
the
racks
of
solvent
vials
and
the
giant
autoclave
is
she
going
to
be
okay
debra
asked
i
think
so
it
in
her
interest
that
we
keep
her
here
and
away
from
a
hospital
gunshot
wounds
raise
a
lot
of
questions
i
seriously
doubt
that
that
pistol
was
licensed
in
her
name
given
how
little
she
seemed
to
know
about
its
operation
he
settled
into
a
chair
and
began
stroking
his
brow
did
you
manage
to
take
care
of
that
matter
with
alexa
hampton
she
nodded
you
know
she
not
yet
entirely
with
the
program
yes
but
she
will
be
putting
her
mother
in
the
clinical
trials
was
probably
crucial
he
grimaced
god
what
a
nightmare
a
medical
experiment
that
got
away
from
us
has
turned
into
guns
and
virtual
kidnapping
and
god
knows
what
manner
of
felonies
if
this
thing
gets
completely
off
the
track
we
could
all
go
to
prison
but
the
real
tragedy
is
that
all
the
successful
research
we
done
here
will
be
buried
in
infamy
it
not
going
to
turn
out
that
way
the
results
here
have
been
so
spectacular
she
was
gazing
at
him
with
eyes
that
seemed
too
worshipful
more
and
more
she
made
him
she
needed
a
father
but
he
did
not
need
a
daughter
he
still
lived
on
the
memory
of
camille
this
has
all
got
to
be
resolved
soon
deb
there
a
reporter
who
found
out
that
we
had
to
drop
a
patient
from
the
program
which
would
be
kristen
and
thinks
he
a
little
too
close
for
comfort
now
kristen
mother
shows
up
it
all
starting
to
unravel
do
worry
she
said
getting
up
this
hampton
woman
is
going
to
be
back
today
so
i
got
to
get
started
on
her
blood
chapter
april
ally
was
very
fond
of
kristen
west
village
neighborhood
since
she
herself
had
once
had
an
apartment
on
west
eleventh
street
just
west
of
seventh
avenue
the
street
was
and
many
of
its
century
town
houses
were
home
to
single
families
though
sometimes
the
ground
floor
with
the
entry
under
the
stoop
beneath
the
stairs
was
rented
out
to
provide
a
little
side
income
she
had
rented
one
of
those
garden
apartments
the
upstairs
owners
were
two
gay
bankers
and
had
loved
it
however
it
also
was
entirely
possible
that
kristen
had
the
whole
town
house
to
herself
that
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
lot
of
celebrities
who
lived
or
even
just
spent
time
in
new
york
did
there
was
privacy
and
there
also
was
the
sense
of
living
in
an
actual
house
instead
of
in
some
apartment
then
again
she
could
have
a
downstairs
neighbor
a
solitary
town
house
seemed
somewhat
at
odds
with
the
extroverted
personality
kristen
displayed
on
tv
but
the
privacy
was
probably
intended
more
for
her
sugar
daddy
winston
bartlett
than
for
her
ally
had
been
pushing
the
pace
ever
since
she
got
off
the
phone
with
stone
at
street
she
had
peeled
off
the
west
side
highway
and
gone
over
to
seventh
avenue
where
she
had
a
straight
shot
downtown
she
passed
st
vincent
hospital
and
the
notorious
intersection
that
caused
so
many
accidents
and
hung
a
right
on
west
eleventh
she
was
approaching
the
corner
at
bleecker
street
when
a
huge
black
lincoln
navigator
lumbered
in
front
of
her
at
an
angle
that
cut
her
off
and
blocked
the
street
then
the
vehicle
abruptly
slammed
to
a
halt
what
she
hit
her
own
brakes
and
managed
to
slide
to
a
stop
just
before
she
collided
with
the
lincoln
rear
bumper
at
first
she
thought
deliberately
cut
her
off
but
then
she
realized
the
move
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
a
man
and
a
woman
were
piling
out
he
was
muscular
and
balding
with
dark
hair
and
sunglasses
and
he
was
dressed
in
black
she
had
red
hair
streaked
with
white
and
was
dressed
in
a
whites
they
were
in
a
major
hurry
that
was
when
she
recognized
the
man
she
met
at
gramercy
park
the
japanese
sidekick
bartlett
had
called
ken
oh
shit
then
she
realized
that
a
thirtyish
woman
was
running
down
west
eleventh
street
toward
them
carrying
a
dark
green
backpack
in
her
left
hand
they
were
gesturing
for
her
to
come
to
them
and
get
into
the
vehicle
though
she
did
appear
to
see
them
yet
halfway
down
the
block
behind
her
a
man
in
a
tan
flight
jacket
was
running
calling
out
kristen
wait
i
just
want
to
talk
the
running
woman
glanced
over
her
shoulder
at
him
and
at
that
moment
collided
with
bartlett
flunky
as
she
recoiled
from
the
impact
the
woman
seized
her
left
arm
kirby
come
the
woman
said
you
not
well
we
take
you
back
no
she
yelled
and
twisted
free
of
the
woman
grasp
but
now
the
japanese
guy
had
grabbed
her
other
arm
it
going
to
be
all
right
he
said
as
he
caught
the
top
of
her
head
and
started
shoving
her
through
the
open
door
of
the
navigator
you
should
go
out
alone
at
that
moment
the
man
in
the
tan
flight
jacket
reached
the
scene
it
was
stone
but
he
been
moments
too
late
he
stretched
his
arm
into
the
lincoln
and
tried
to
take
the
hand
kristen
do
go
with
them
i
just
need
to
talk
you
do
need
to
do
anything
pal
the
man
called
ken
declared
except
get
out
of
the
way
he
chopped
the
side
of
stone
neck
with
an
open
hand
sending
him
sprawling
backwards
onto
the
pavement
flight
jacket
askew
now
something
odd
was
going
on
another
girl
was
running
down
the
sidewalk
kristy
wait
do
but
the
redheaded
woman
had
already
gotten
into
the
backseat
of
the
suv
beside
the
girl
and
the
japanese
man
was
heading
around
the
front
three
seconds
later
he
was
behind
the
wheel
and
peeling
out
they
were
gone
ally
sat
watching
stunned
but
now
a
chevy
sedan
was
departing
a
parking
space
three
cars
down
from
where
she
was
and
she
quickly
pulled
in
by
then
stone
aimes
had
picked
himself
up
off
the
sidewalk
and
was
gazing
wistfully
in
the
direction
of
the
vanishing
lincoln
the
girl
who
been
behind
him
stopped
and
was
talking
to
him
ally
quickly
locked
the
toyota
and
went
over
but
why
did
she
run
stone
aimes
was
asking
he
was
disheveled
but
then
being
slugged
and
knocked
to
the
sidewalk
takes
a
toll
on
anybody
poise
she
did
know
who
you
were
the
girl
replied
she
looked
like
she
would
have
been
more
at
home
in
the
east
village
than
here
late
twenties
tattoo
on
one
bicep
eyebrows
pierced
blue
jeans
hair
needing
a
better
day
she
had
serious
acne
scars
on
her
cheeks
i
think
she
thought
you
were
them
whoever
they
were
ally
looked
stone
over
and
felt
a
surge
of
admiration
in
spite
of
the
fact
he
just
got
decked
there
was
an
athletic
feeling
about
the
way
he
carried
his
body
as
though
he
was
ready
to
pounce
on
a
news
source
only
he
just
did
pounce
quite
fast
enough
this
time
she
walked
up
and
gave
him
a
hug
for
a
lot
of
reasons
hey
we
ca
go
on
meeting
like
this
my
god
how
humiliating
he
winced
what
in
heaven
name
just
happened
that
was
kristen
all
right
but
why
was
she
running
from
you
i
saw
this
woman
walking
very
fast
up
the
street
carrying
a
backpack
and
i
just
took
a
shot
and
called
out
she
glanced
back
at
me
then
took
off
like
a
rabbit
all
i
accomplished
was
to
drive
her
directly
into
the
grasp
of
those
goons
you
scared
her
the
girl
with
the
pierced
eyebrows
shouted
gazing
angrily
at
stone
who
are
you
why
did
you
i
a
newspaper
reporter
he
said
who
are
you
i
sublet
the
garden
apartment
from
her
i
met
her
when
i
was
doing
her
makeup
at
the
e
channel
i
mentioned
i
was
looking
for
a
place
and
she
said
she
liked
me
and
wanted
somebody
she
liked
to
be
her
subtenant
the
rent
is
really
low
then
they
canceled
her
show
and
she
had
a
mental
meltdown
and
went
to
a
spa
somewhere
to
regroup
or
at
least
that
what
everybody
at
e
says
so
that
definitely
kristen
starr
ally
asked
i
had
seen
her
in
over
five
months
not
even
to
pay
the
rent
and
i
could
believe
it
was
her
when
she
rang
my
bell
and
asked
if
she
could
borrow
my
copy
of
her
key
at
first
i
almost
did
recognize
her
she
looked
different
somehow
the
odd
part
was
i
got
the
impression
that
she
did
recognize
me
either
at
least
for
a
minute
or
two
when
i
asked
her
if
she
wanted
the
rent
she
just
looked
at
me
funny
a
few
minutes
later
she
brought
the
key
back
and
she
had
a
backpack
stuffed
with
clothes
and
papers
she
seemed
nervous
and
disoriented
i
was
going
to
try
and
help
her
get
a
cab
but
then
you
showed
up
hey
look
i
had
no
idea
i
was
going
to
freak
her
out
like
that
stone
said
what
your
name
ally
asked
and
then
she
introduced
herself
my
named
is
cindy
dobbs
and
you
know
something
kristen
did
seem
like
the
same
person
in
a
lot
of
ways
she
looked
really
different
i
do
know
how
to
explain
it
but
something
was
really
really
wrong
with
her
and
she
kept
saying
her
name
was
kristen
that
something
else
i
ca
remember
what
now
all
i
know
is
she
was
totally
spooked
talk
about
bad
timing
stone
said
she
was
so
paranoid
she
kept
babbling
about
how
knew
she
was
here
in
her
apartment
and
were
coming
to
get
her
and
she
had
to
get
away
real
quick
i
do
know
who
she
was
talking
about
some
guy
used
to
come
by
and
his
white
stretch
limo
would
be
for
a
couple
of
hours
while
he
went
in
but
other
than
him
nobody
ever
came
here
cindy
the
truth
is
i
was
talking
to
her
this
very
morning
on
the
phone
ally
said
i
the
one
who
called
her
i
also
met
her
mother
today
who
just
got
a
crazy
letter
from
her
and
was
walking
around
with
a
pistol
because
of
it
i
getting
to
be
deeply
invested
in
kristen
starr
something
bizarre
seems
to
have
happened
to
her
and
i
need
to
find
out
what
it
is
ally
did
want
to
confess
that
she
felt
indirectly
responsible
for
what
had
just
occurred
if
she
had
phoned
she
stood
thinking
a
minute
then
did
you
say
you
had
a
key
to
her
place
cindy
shrugged
i
had
it
since
i
moved
in
we
had
copies
of
each
other
keys
just
in
case
you
know
she
reached
into
her
ragged
jeans
and
pulled
it
out
and
stared
at
it
it
was
attached
to
a
blue
plastic
tab
greenwich
locksmiths
then
could
we
borrow
it
long
enough
to
go
in
and
take
a
look
around
maybe
we
could
find
some
clue
to
what
going
on
hey
if
you
want
the
key
and
you
think
it
can
help
you
find
her
you
can
just
have
it
she
was
holding
it
out
i
do
want
to
go
in
there
ever
with
my
luck
those
people
would
show
up
again
and
take
me
away
but
let
me
know
if
you
find
out
anything
okay
i
really
thought
of
her
as
a
friend
even
though
we
actually
did
know
each
other
that
well
she
did
ever
introduce
me
to
that
older
guy
who
came
around
probably
because
he
was
married
at
least
that
my
guess
i
think
she
knows
those
people
who
grabbed
her
just
now
ally
said
taking
the
key
cindy
can
we
exchange
phone
numbers
sure
i
meant
it
about
letting
me
know
if
you
find
out
what
going
on
with
her
everybody
at
work
is
going
to
be
really
bummed
when
they
hear
about
this
moments
later
ally
and
stone
were
alone
on
the
street
with
stone
still
appearing
dazed
now
taking
measure
of
him
in
the
daylight
she
noticed
a
bit
more
of
the
mileage
in
his
face
and
body
still
it
was
good
mileage
and
it
had
left
him
seasoned
and
lean
also
she
sensed
that
he
really
cared
about
things
this
was
more
like
the
man
she
remembered
a
mensch
in
wolf
clothing
are
you
sure
you
okay
she
asked
i
going
to
be
fine
he
said
jesus
i
never
dreamed
i
spook
her
the
way
i
did
by
the
way
did
you
get
the
license
number
of
that
lincoln
i
sure
as
hell
did
i
did
need
it
that
guy
is
winston
bartlett
personal
bodyguard
he
called
him
ken
i
was
at
bartlett
place
on
gramercy
park
a
couple
of
days
ago
and
i
saw
him
there
you
not
kidding
are
you
i
wish
she
paused
you
know
kristen
and
bartlett
were
being
talked
about
as
an
item
back
when
six
the
sentinel
would
never
touch
it
but
that
was
more
than
a
rumor
over
the
years
i
had
occasion
to
take
more
than
a
passing
interest
in
his
affairs
he
grinned
and
for
the
past
several
days
he
been
taking
a
lot
more
interest
in
my
affairs
ever
since
he
found
out
about
the
book
incidentally
she
declared
i
did
have
a
chance
to
tell
you
on
the
phone
but
kristen
seems
to
have
no
memory
of
who
she
is
somebody
told
her
that
her
name
is
kirby
and
that
what
she
insists
on
being
called
all
in
all
she
sounded
deeply
screwed
up
she
dangled
the
key
so
why
do
we
go
up
and
see
if
we
can
learn
anything
did
it
seem
odd
to
you
that
what
her
name
cindy
did
want
to
go
in
with
us
he
mused
as
they
headed
up
the
steps
well
maybe
she
already
seen
it
god
only
knows
what
we
going
to
find
though
the
place
she
had
in
chelsea
was
pretty
well
maintained
after
i
redid
it
it
was
a
knockout
of
course
but
she
already
moved
down
here
by
then
the
building
dated
from
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
entryway
painted
white
was
a
slight
nod
to
the
fashion
for
the
greek
revival
style
that
made
its
way
into
the
new
york
town
houses
of
that
period
she
shoved
the
key
into
the
new
lock
a
medico
and
pushed
open
the
door
stone
moved
past
her
and
switched
on
the
light
what
awaited
them
was
a
minimally
furnished
but
elegant
living
room
with
a
small
couch
and
table
the
downstairs
parlor
floor
had
been
opened
up
a
lot
of
walls
had
been
taken
out
and
a
staircase
was
on
one
side
of
the
front
room
it
felt
like
a
modern
loft
memorabilia
from
e
was
all
over
the
logo
on
throw
pillows
and
two
empty
mugs
on
the
table
the
main
decoration
however
consisted
of
publicity
photos
of
kristen
around
the
walls
a
smiling
blonde
with
flowing
tresses
down
over
her
shoulders
in
all
of
them
she
was
wearing
heavy
makeup
and
the
photos
appeared
to
have
been
airbrushed
they
were
both
trying
to
absorb
what
they
were
actually
seeing
each
photo
and
there
were
at
least
sixteen
was
pinned
to
the
walls
with
a
steak
knife
all
with
matching
white
bone
handles
jesus
who
do
you
think
did
this
stone
asked
could
it
be
that
ditzy
girl
downstairs
i
say
she
did
it
herself
supposedly
the
reason
she
went
to
the
dorian
institute
was
because
she
was
having
some
kind
of
personal
crisis
over
starting
to
look
older
she
was
consumed
with
terminal
that
what
this
has
to
be
about
i
never
caught
her
on
tv
stone
said
walking
over
to
study
one
of
the
photos
but
from
what
little
i
saw
of
her
on
the
street
just
now
she
sure
seemed
different
from
these
head
shots
well
this
is
exactly
how
she
looked
on
the
tube
she
told
him
the
alleged
story
of
how
kristen
had
ended
up
at
the
dorian
institute
then
she
gazed
around
the
room
still
having
trouble
taking
it
in
jesus
this
is
really
sick
ally
i
absolutely
convinced
that
whatever
happened
or
happen
keep
that
possibility
in
mind
to
kristen
is
connected
somehow
to
the
reason
gerex
clinical
trials
have
been
put
under
ironclad
security
which
is
why
no
matter
what
they
got
to
get
her
back
on
the
reservation
ally
thought
a
moment
van
de
vliet
told
me
she
left
the
clinic
of
her
own
accord
which
clearly
was
bs
winston
bartlett
has
her
stashed
somewhere
probably
in
an
apartment
in
one
of
the
buildings
he
owns
she
looked
over
what
do
you
think
it
all
means
how
this
for
a
guess
kristen
is
experiencing
some
kind
of
side
effect
that
truly
horrendous
losing
your
memory
is
bad
enough
but
there
probably
something
more
too
i
ca
imagine
what
it
is
but
if
the
truth
about
it
ever
gets
out
their
entire
program
of
stem
cell
research
would
be
jeopardized
well
i
do
see
much
here
to
help
us
find
her
she
declared
looking
around
the
knives
in
the
walls
do
speak
well
for
her
grip
on
sanity
who
knows
maybe
nothing
physically
wrong
with
her
maybe
it
just
all
in
her
crazy
head
look
at
this
place
for
sake
except
for
the
knives
it
looks
pretty
normal
maybe
she
just
a
nutcase
and
imagining
that
her
memory
is
going
as
she
gazed
around
the
room
one
last
time
she
noticed
an
answering
machine
on
the
floor
next
to
the
couch
the
message
light
on
it
was
blinking
and
she
walked
over
and
pushed
the
play
button
she
remembered
that
stone
had
said
he
had
left
a
message
and
kristen
had
picked
up
when
she
called
her
the
voice
mail
the
phone
machine
announced
in
an
electronic
voice
you
have
one
message
at
then
an
unctuous
male
voice
came
on
kirby
we
know
you
there
you
still
in
treatment
you
should
be
wandering
around
unsupervised
it
a
lot
better
a
lot
safer
for
you
to
stay
with
us
now
this
is
ken
i
coming
with
delores
to
pick
you
up
i
know
upset
but
you
should
be
we
going
to
take
care
of
you
and
help
you
then
the
phone
machine
clicked
off
my
god
stone
said
glancing
at
his
watch
that
almost
exactly
when
i
got
here
that
why
she
thought
i
was
with
them
that
the
guy
who
slugged
you
i
recognize
his
voice
guess
they
suspected
she
was
here
and
that
phone
call
was
intended
to
flush
her
out
it
worked
and
i
ended
up
right
in
the
middle
of
it
damn
she
walked
around
the
empty
room
checking
it
out
except
for
the
head
shots
stabbed
to
the
wall
there
was
not
a
scrap
of
paper
to
be
seen
so
how
do
we
find
kristen
without
a
clue
she
wondered
should
the
kidnapping
if
that
what
it
was
be
reported
to
the
police
but
what
proof
do
we
have
that
any
of
it
actually
happened
they
not
going
to
winston
bartlett
you
know
stone
said
staring
closely
at
one
of
the
photos
i
actually
get
a
really
good
look
at
the
woman
running
down
the
street
she
glanced
back
at
me
when
i
called
out
her
name
but
the
truth
is
i
not
a
hundred
percent
sure
this
is
her
come
on
ally
said
that
had
to
be
kristen
the
girl
downstairs
recognized
her
though
she
did
say
she
looked
different
somehow
you
going
to
think
i
crazy
he
went
on
still
staring
around
at
the
walls
but
it
seems
to
me
the
girl
on
the
street
was
a
lot
younger
than
this
one
he
bit
a
fingernail
contemplatively
christ
this
is
some
sick
material
stone
i
going
down
to
my
office
to
take
care
of
some
things
and
think
about
this
come
along
if
you
like
maybe
we
overlooked
something
obvious
something
that
that
was
when
the
beeper
on
his
belt
went
off
he
looked
down
at
the
number
whoops
it
my
managing
editor
where
you
work
right
only
i
got
a
feeling
this
call
could
be
about
how
i
used
to
work
there
chapter
april
ellen
who
was
in
charge
of
the
nursing
staff
at
the
dorian
institute
and
chair
of
the
union
committee
for
the
gerex
corporation
looked
around
the
room
which
was
a
conference
space
just
off
the
laboratory
in
the
first
level
of
the
basement
each
of
the
three
other
nurses
present
reported
directly
to
her
and
they
had
filed
in
casually
one
by
one
in
order
not
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
research
staff
as
they
passed
the
laboratory
they
all
sensed
the
imminence
of
crisis
and
this
was
a
clandestine
emergency
meeting
the
appearance
of
katherine
starr
and
the
shooting
that
transpired
had
left
the
entire
nursing
staff
in
dismay
of
course
they
all
remembered
kristen
starr
the
outgoing
and
scatterbrained
tv
personality
who
had
arrived
in
the
throes
of
a
mental
meltdown
some
also
remembered
her
mother
katherine
who
had
made
a
nuisance
of
herself
till
she
was
refused
further
admittance
on
the
orders
everyone
suspected
of
the
owner
winston
bartlett
who
was
widely
reported
to
have
a
romantic
relationship
with
the
girl
they
also
suspected
that
something
had
started
going
terribly
wrong
with
kristen
cosmetic
procedure
after
seeming
okay
her
behavior
had
suddenly
become
erratic
and
she
had
been
immediately
whisked
into
intensive
care
in
the
subbasement
and
quarantined
before
anybody
on
the
regular
nursing
staff
could
learn
what
the
problem
was
she
was
attended
by
the
research
team
he
had
brought
from
california
and
the
information
officer
at
the
registration
desk
in
the
lobby
may
gooden
was
instructed
to
say
she
had
voluntarily
left
the
program
well
maybe
she
had
but
she
had
left
the
institute
then
less
than
a
week
ago
she
was
rolled
out
on
a
gurney
and
loaded
into
the
ambulance
which
was
driven
by
winston
bartlett
japanese
thug
and
taken
god
knows
where
ellen
had
checked
and
was
dismayed
though
not
entirely
surprised
to
discover
that
none
of
this
had
been
included
in
the
weekly
trial
reports
being
forwarded
to
the
national
institutes
of
health
which
in
itself
was
a
flagrant
violation
of
procedural
requirements
and
now
this
kristen
own
mother
showed
up
deranged
and
carrying
a
pistol
looking
for
her
how
much
longer
would
it
be
before
the
nih
or
the
police
found
out
that
something
funny
had
gone
on
right
now
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
get
the
three
senior
nurses
in
the
room
to
put
a
lid
on
the
rumors
they
were
her
lieutenants
it
was
their
job
elise
baker
single
and
sharp
and
acerbic
was
in
charge
of
the
second
floor
mary
hinds
a
kindly
mother
of
two
had
responsibility
for
the
third
floor
and
may
gooden
the
queen
of
communication
skills
handled
the
reception
and
oversaw
the
staff
responsible
for
the
dining
room
all
three
were
in
their
forties
and
they
reported
to
ellen
who
reported
to
karl
van
de
vliet
elise
could
you
please
close
the
door
sure
she
was
getting
up
is
this
the
quorum
you
do
want
anybody
else
here
we
have
to
decide
what
to
do
about
katherine
starr
ellen
began
in
my
opinion
the
absolute
first
thing
we
have
to
do
is
make
sure
the
story
of
what
just
happened
never
leaves
this
building
well
i
think
vee
should
call
the
police
and
have
her
arrested
elise
said
as
she
quietly
shut
the
door
the
very
idea
barging
in
here
with
a
loaded
gun
i
do
feel
safe
in
the
lobby
anymore
may
gooden
declared
her
face
was
lined
and
she
had
streaks
of
premature
gray
we
all
exposed
out
here
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
i
think
charles
should
have
a
pistol
what
good
is
it
having
a
guard
if
you
still
not
secure
mary
what
do
you
think
ellen
asked
she
knew
mary
would
always
try
to
split
the
difference
and
reconcile
differing
opinions
i
do
know
maybe
it
was
just
the
case
of
one
crazy
person
probably
not
going
to
happen
again
okay
ellen
thought
that
three
different
votes
call
the
cops
beef
up
security
or
put
our
collective
heads
in
the
sand
she
worried
about
the
others
but
she
was
also
worried
about
her
own
situation
her
husband
harold
left
her
eight
years
ago
for
a
younger
woman
and
after
reclaiming
her
maiden
name
she
raised
their
two
young
sons
on
her
own
now
the
oldest
eric
was
ready
to
start
college
and
she
had
no
idea
how
she
was
going
to
pay
for
it
if
she
lost
this
job
the
gerex
corporation
paid
her
almost
twice
what
she
would
be
earning
as
an
at
an
ordinary
hospital
with
her
current
salary
she
had
a
shot
at
providing
the
boys
with
an
education
without
it
if
gerex
got
embroiled
in
some
horrible
scandal
and
was
put
out
of
business
she
had
no
hope
whatsoever
even
worse
she
might
be
named
as
being
complicit
in
some
unethical
shenanigans
knowingly
putting
a
patient
at
risk
in
a
human
trial
that
would
certainly
drive
a
stake
into
the
heart
of
her
nursing
career
elise
we
better
think
long
and
hard
about
bringing
in
the
police
they
would
talk
to
katherine
and
she
tell
them
kristen
was
missing
and
we
simply
have
no
idea
where
it
would
end
she
paused
i
about
to
say
something
i
should
but
i
guess
this
is
the
moment
you
all
deserve
to
know
an
important
fact
the
nih
has
not
been
told
the
reason
kristen
starr
was
terminated
from
the
stem
cell
program
how
do
you
know
that
elise
asked
i
just
checked
the
reporting
records
call
it
a
hunch
we
all
know
that
for
a
formal
clinical
trial
that
a
flagrant
violation
of
nih
rules
what
are
you
saying
mary
asked
her
voice
filling
with
alarm
i
saying
we
have
no
choice
but
to
keep
this
whole
matter
of
kristen
and
her
mother
under
cover
if
the
dorian
institute
gets
caught
tampering
with
the
data
from
a
clinical
trial
it
could
be
the
end
of
everybody
career
van
de
vliet
certainly
but
most
probably
ours
as
well
my
god
elise
blurted
out
did
we
have
to
wait
till
some
crazy
person
with
a
gun
barged
in
here
before
you
got
around
to
telling
us
that
data
had
been
fiddled
with
maybe
vee
still
intends
to
provide
a
full
report
to
the
nih
whatever
he
intends
if
this
whole
matter
blows
up
the
less
any
of
us
knows
about
what
may
have
gone
on
the
better
well
elise
declared
i
think
they
all
should
be
confronted
the
clinical
trials
are
over
yet
there
be
a
final
report
so
he
can
still
give
the
nih
whatever
data
had
been
left
out
we
should
confront
him
and
demand
that
he
give
a
full
accounting
in
the
final
report
otherwise
we
all
could
end
up
being
part
of
some
conspiracy
maybe
we
ought
to
think
this
over
for
a
few
days
before
we
do
anything
drastic
mary
said
we
do
know
what
he
intends
to
do
and
still
time
if
we
start
giving
vee
ultimatums
it
just
going
to
upset
him
even
more
he
could
have
been
killed
taking
the
gun
away
from
her
he
got
enough
to
worry
about
just
now
maybe
he
going
to
handle
her
special
case
some
other
way
that
we
do
know
about
my
concern
right
now
ellen
said
is
the
people
who
work
under
us
i
do
think
pulling
an
ostrich
number
is
going
to
protect
anybody
we
got
to
get
out
of
denial
and
face
up
to
how
serious
this
might
get
and
i
tell
you
our
number
one
priority
right
now
if
katherine
starr
walks
out
of
here
before
the
kristen
problem
is
cleared
up
and
gets
the
ear
of
someone
in
the
media
then
everybody
who
works
here
let
just
say
we
must
allow
that
to
happen
that
why
having
this
meeting
are
you
suggesting
we
should
keep
her
sedated
mary
asked
all
her
medications
have
to
be
approved
by
no
sedative
should
be
listed
on
her
chart
and
i
not
telling
you
what
to
do
but
use
your
imagination
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
as
the
implications
of
the
unspoken
order
settled
in
and
starting
immediately
we
need
to
hold
a
meeting
of
the
staff
on
each
floor
and
impress
on
them
that
the
story
of
katherine
starr
must
never
leave
this
building
ever
remind
everybody
that
that
would
be
a
serious
violation
of
a
staffer
original
security
agreement
and
would
subject
them
to
legal
action
the
likes
of
which
they
ca
even
begin
to
imagine
and
if
somebody
comes
around
asking
questions
about
kristen
starr
nobody
here
knows
anything
we
can
say
she
was
here
because
that
part
of
the
record
and
she
is
no
longer
here
end
of
statement
beyond
that
nobody
knows
zip
this
problem
is
far
from
over
ellen
told
herself
god
only
knows
how
it
going
to
end
chapter
april
as
stone
aimes
stepped
off
the
elevator
on
the
sixth
floor
his
mind
was
running
through
his
options
this
phone
call
had
to
be
about
winston
bartlett
he
was
going
to
step
up
the
pressure
first
there
was
the
hellfire
meeting
in
jane
office
and
now
he
seen
a
kidnapping
maybe
this
was
about
that
was
jane
going
to
pass
along
a
threat
of
legal
action
if
that
crime
got
reported
the
managing
editor
jay
had
left
a
message
with
the
receptionist
rhonda
to
be
forwarded
to
stone
gist
he
was
urgently
required
in
the
office
of
their
corporate
counsel
what
does
this
tell
me
he
wondered
that
they
going
to
try
to
do
something
to
me
that
could
have
legal
ramifications
no
more
likely
it
means
that
i
going
to
be
given
an
ultimatum
maybe
an
injunction
and
jane
gets
to
deliver
it
with
all
the
legal
trimmings
still
he
was
determined
to
go
on
you
shall
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
jive
right
well
not
necessarily
but
at
the
least
the
truth
could
make
a
hell
of
a
book
and
with
that
came
financial
freedom
at
least
for
a
while
the
hallway
felt
desolate
and
ominous
as
he
walked
through
the
doorway
that
opened
onto
the
cubicles
jane
tully
was
down
on
the
third
floor
but
he
wanted
to
stop
by
his
desk
first
and
see
if
there
been
any
further
communications
from
winston
bartlett
possibly
there
still
could
be
a
deal
in
the
making
the
room
itself
was
silent
no
one
meeting
his
eye
maybe
he
thought
it
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
everybody
dozing
off
from
a
late
lunch
but
when
he
got
to
his
cubicle
he
realized
why
he
had
suddenly
become
invisible
the
top
of
his
desk
was
bare
and
there
were
three
large
cardboard
boxes
sitting
on
the
gray
carpet
next
to
it
i
think
i
get
the
picture
he
said
to
the
empty
space
it
looked
like
winston
bartlett
had
just
provided
him
with
a
career
decision
for
a
moment
he
felt
his
life
passing
before
his
eyes
but
then
all
he
could
think
about
was
the
future
this
was
not
just
the
end
of
a
era
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
next
phase
of
his
life
he
saw
everyone
still
avoiding
his
eyes
as
he
turned
around
and
walked
back
to
the
elevator
how
much
did
jane
know
about
this
she
had
to
know
everything
which
was
why
jay
sent
him
to
see
her
she
would
have
no
qualms
about
giving
someone
the
ax
including
a
former
lover
when
he
stepped
off
the
elevator
on
the
third
floor
rhonda
looked
at
him
as
though
he
were
a
corpse
she
i
know
she
here
do
bother
buzzing
her
he
strode
purposefully
down
the
hallway
realizing
it
was
probably
the
last
time
he
ever
walk
it
and
pushed
open
jane
door
she
was
on
the
phone
and
looked
up
startled
putting
her
hand
over
the
mouthpiece
what
just
came
to
say
farewell
jay
told
me
to
come
see
you
i
guess
he
was
sure
you
want
to
be
part
of
this
important
life
moment
stone
for
god
sake
she
turned
back
to
the
phone
let
me
call
you
tomorrow
she
slammed
down
the
receiver
you
have
to
know
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
bartlett
got
to
the
family
i
think
it
was
one
of
those
noblesse
oblige
kind
of
things
old
money
meets
new
money
and
needs
to
placate
it
the
sentinel
is
only
marginally
a
making
enterprise
and
the
last
thing
they
need
is
a
lot
of
shit
from
their
landlord
he
wanted
you
gone
and
since
your
job
was
a
small
price
for
them
to
pay
to
ensure
domestic
tranquility
do
the
math
sorry
but
that
how
it
had
to
be
for
god
sake
stone
why
did
you
drive
him
to
this
the
ironic
thing
was
she
was
managing
to
look
vaguely
contrite
tugging
at
a
lock
of
short
hair
he
was
sure
how
she
had
the
brass
apologies
from
the
executioner
are
traditionally
a
tough
sell
let
me
tell
you
something
jane
i
already
know
more
about
winston
bartlett
than
he
wants
he
had
somebody
kidnapped
today
before
my
very
eyes
i
even
got
slugged
trying
to
stop
it
so
you
can
tell
his
lawyers
to
tell
him
he
better
back
off
the
people
who
did
it
were
recognized
and
they
work
for
him
if
he
wants
to
play
tough
i
could
have
a
heartfelt
exchange
with
somebody
i
know
very
well
at
the
sixth
precinct
and
also
with
the
tabloids
where
i
know
a
shitload
of
hungry
columnists
winston
bartlett
could
get
real
famous
real
fast
stone
you
brought
this
on
yourself
i
tried
to
warn
you
but
on
your
own
destruction
you
your
own
worst
enemy
she
picked
up
her
blackberry
and
switched
it
off
and
sighed
you
never
listened
to
me
before
and
i
do
expect
you
to
do
it
now
but
take
some
free
advice
anyway
try
not
to
piss
off
important
people
it
is
frequently
a
negative
career
move
jane
you
know
john
kennedy
once
said
party
loyalty
asks
too
much
and
i
think
that
moment
for
me
is
now
from
here
on
i
going
to
be
doing
what
i
need
to
do
not
what
bartlett
or
jay
or
whoever
tells
me
to
do
i
guess
that
includes
you
too
there
comes
a
time
when
i
have
to
do
what
in
my
heart
she
was
finally
focusing
looking
at
him
strangely
stone
what
did
you
just
say
bartlett
had
somebody
kidnapped
today
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
did
i
secure
your
vagrant
attention
good
actually
it
was
less
than
an
hour
ago
there
no
point
in
going
into
details
but
i
pretty
sure
she
was
the
patient
terminated
from
the
clinical
trials
at
the
dorian
institute
that
i
had
you
ask
bartlett
lawyers
about
i
think
there
the
possibility
that
something
really
weird
began
happening
to
her
out
there
in
new
jersey
but
i
did
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
her
because
they
grabbed
her
and
took
off
well
what
do
you
think
happened
to
her
out
there
the
only
thing
i
heard
and
that
secondhand
is
that
she
lost
some
part
of
her
memory
she
even
having
trouble
remembering
her
name
how
do
you
know
all
this
she
asked
staring
at
him
were
you
i
know
somebody
who
talked
with
her
this
morning
just
a
few
short
exchanges
on
the
phone
that
all
i
can
tell
you
they
doing
something
very
powerful
there
at
the
institute
but
in
her
case
it
seems
to
have
gone
horribly
wrong
that
my
best
guess
so
they
dropped
her
from
the
clinical
trials
and
gave
her
a
new
identity
and
stashed
her
someplace
incommunicado
but
she
got
away
for
a
couple
of
hours
somehow
and
managed
to
go
back
to
her
old
apartment
in
her
case
it
a
village
town
house
but
bartlett
nabbed
her
back
if
you
really
believe
all
that
stone
should
you
be
worried
for
your
own
safety
it
was
clear
she
was
finally
taking
him
seriously
bartlett
got
me
fired
that
probably
enough
for
now
i
do
know
enough
to
be
a
threat
to
him
yet
but
what
if
you
find
out
whatever
it
is
you
looking
for
then
then
i
know
if
medical
miracles
sometimes
come
with
a
strange
price
she
was
looking
at
him
pity
entering
her
dark
eyes
what
are
you
going
to
do
for
money
the
child
support
you
send
to
amy
she
hesitated
i
so
sorry
about
this
stone
if
you
need
a
little
help
for
the
short
term
i
could
do
go
there
i
can
take
cash
out
on
a
couple
of
credit
cards
and
when
i
turn
in
the
manuscript
for
the
book
i
get
the
other
thirds
of
the
advance
after
that
i
hoping
i
might
get
an
actual
career
oh
stone
i
really
sorry
about
this
she
said
with
feeling
truly
i
am
i
guess
i
still
enjoy
seeing
you
having
you
around
you
a
mensch
you
know
that
whatever
your
other
failings
and
god
knows
they
plenty
you
were
always
kind
you
even
kind
to
people
who
do
necessarily
wish
you
well
well
tell
that
to
amy
if
you
ever
get
the
chance
sometimes
she
thinks
her
dad
is
the
meanest
guy
alive
particularly
when
i
honor
her
every
whim
you
a
good
father
too
she
sighed
for
stone
this
was
always
the
moment
that
he
wanted
her
back
when
she
let
her
guard
down
dammit
stone
why
could
we
make
a
go
of
it
we
stopped
having
fun
jane
that
all
that
happened
i
started
to
bore
you
back
then
i
did
provide
enough
excitement
enough
sturm
und
drang
in
your
life
you
were
dull
stone
but
sometimes
you
could
be
maddeningly
smug
that
may
be
about
to
change
now
that
i
an
unemployed
freelancer
and
i
just
ran
into
a
blast
from
the
past
who
knows
what
my
life
is
about
to
be
like
he
turned
to
leave
by
the
way
give
my
best
to
jay
hopefully
he
be
the
last
managing
editor
i
ever
have
to
suck
up
to
take
care
stone
she
was
getting
up
you
can
fight
this
you
know
they
had
me
write
up
some
kind
of
bullshit
contract
brief
in
case
you
would
go
quietly
but
it
full
of
holes
i
know
since
i
deliberately
wrote
it
that
way
hey
thanks
anyway
it
not
worth
it
i
not
going
to
fight
to
keep
a
job
i
never
liked
all
that
much
in
the
first
place
every
time
i
wanted
to
do
some
serious
journalism
like
that
piece
about
using
the
internet
to
store
everybody
medical
records
jay
always
found
a
reason
not
to
run
it
i
only
got
so
much
dignity
to
lose
he
turned
and
strode
out
of
the
office
deciding
to
forego
any
more
farewells
besides
he
had
better
things
to
do
get
somebody
from
the
mailroom
to
carry
the
boxes
the
shards
of
his
erstwhile
career
to
the
lobby
where
he
could
get
a
cab
take
the
files
home
stash
them
and
then
get
going
chapter
april
hi
he
said
walking
through
the
door
of
ally
downtown
studio
citispace
jennifer
had
the
desk
at
the
front
and
she
served
as
a
makeshift
receptionist
she
looked
up
as
he
continued
i
do
have
an
appointment
but
i
love
to
see
ally
hampton
any
chance
and
you
just
as
he
started
to
tell
her
ally
emerged
from
her
in
the
back
and
spotted
him
stone
what
bet
you
did
think
you
see
me
again
quite
so
soon
she
felt
her
pulse
jump
no
she
had
she
told
him
she
was
going
down
to
the
office
but
she
certainly
had
no
idea
or
hope
he
just
show
up
a
couple
of
hours
later
since
she
got
back
to
the
office
she
been
in
a
struggle
with
her
conscience
over
what
to
do
about
kristen
was
there
any
good
to
be
served
by
bringing
in
the
police
at
the
time
it
had
seemed
pointless
and
it
still
felt
that
way
the
whole
matter
was
awfully
anecdotal
worse
she
did
really
feel
she
should
talk
it
over
with
jennifer
which
she
would
have
loved
to
do
they
supported
each
other
in
a
lot
of
things
but
this
crazy
story
would
just
freak
her
out
why
do
that
the
more
troubling
thing
was
she
started
feeling
tired
and
slightly
dizzy
now
she
was
just
hoping
to
stay
focused
long
enough
to
last
out
the
day
what
she
wondered
was
happening
to
her
it
was
like
a
spell
of
angina
which
thankfully
she
had
had
for
a
couple
of
days
now
no
this
just
felt
like
something
was
sapping
her
energy
she
could
help
the
suspicion
that
this
queasy
condition
was
somehow
related
to
her
encounter
with
van
de
vliet
testy
blond
colleague
debra
while
she
was
supposedly
taking
that
blood
sample
was
she
also
doing
something
else
welcome
to
my
home
away
from
home
you
right
i
did
expect
citispace
he
interjected
seeming
to
try
out
the
word
as
he
looked
around
she
noticed
that
jennifer
and
the
others
automatically
assumed
he
was
a
new
client
of
hers
and
were
trying
to
look
preoccupied
jen
however
was
giving
him
a
furtive
appraisal
running
the
numbers
he
was
a
decent
looker
actually
kind
of
cute
and
he
seemed
pleasant
and
outgoing
not
a
bad
start
that
was
what
she
would
say
the
moment
he
was
out
of
earshot
you
like
the
name
not
bad
sort
of
a
takeoff
on
citibank
my
dad
came
up
with
it
back
before
they
copyrighted
that
name
maybe
they
stole
the
idea
from
us
she
was
feeling
cheered
by
the
sight
of
him
yes
it
was
good
to
have
him
back
for
a
while
maybe
longer
but
come
on
let
me
introduce
you
around
which
she
did
jennifer
gave
her
a
telepathic
glance
that
said
this
guy
looks
like
he
might
be
worth
the
effort
what
the
deal
then
they
went
to
ally
office
a
cubicle
in
the
back
with
a
computer
and
a
drafting
table
she
had
a
cad
program
running
sorry
to
just
invite
myself
down
like
this
he
said
but
i
got
off
work
early
matter
of
fact
i
just
became
a
freelancer
my
office
now
consists
of
three
cardboard
boxes
in
my
apartment
what
do
you
mean
that
phone
page
did
winston
bartlett
owns
the
building
where
the
sentinel
offices
are
seems
he
convinced
the
management
that
it
would
be
in
their
interest
if
i
were
no
longer
employed
there
i
gather
he
thinks
i
know
more
than
i
actually
do
about
what
going
on
out
at
the
dorian
institute
and
i
guess
he
thought
getting
me
fired
would
slow
me
down
what
it
has
done
however
is
to
give
me
even
more
incentive
to
surpass
his
most
paranoid
assumptions
now
i
going
to
take
him
on
i
want
to
know
everything
oh
stone
i
so
sorry
she
was
buying
his
bravado
he
look
like
a
guy
who
could
last
very
long
without
a
paycheck
i
have
to
say
he
gave
me
fair
warning
that
meeting
where
he
yelled
at
me
this
little
turn
of
the
screw
is
not
a
total
shock
but
that
whole
thing
with
kristen
i
bet
that
what
sent
him
over
the
edge
i
should
have
gotten
you
involved
in
that
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
believe
me
he
shrugged
besides
it
gives
me
even
more
motivation
to
finish
the
book
fast
and
i
also
looking
forward
to
spending
some
of
my
newfound
quality
time
with
you
again
if
you
let
me
in
your
favor
you
actually
been
inside
the
dorian
institute
which
is
more
than
i
can
say
she
was
a
big
believer
in
the
magic
of
a
second
time
around
that
would
have
to
await
further
evidence
but
having
stone
back
in
her
life
was
definitely
helping
on
the
front
i
thinking
he
went
on
that
maybe
we
should
go
back
to
apartment
and
turn
the
place
inside
out
do
it
right
we
both
let
ourselves
get
distracted
by
the
little
matter
of
our
other
lives
stone
i
not
sure
she
lowered
her
voice
and
sat
down
at
her
desk
but
i
may
be
having
a
reaction
to
something
one
of
van
de
research
assistants
did
to
me
out
at
the
institute
this
morning
i
do
know
i
just
feeling
sort
of
weak
and
funny
i
thinking
maybe
i
should
call
out
there
and
talk
to
him
she
took
a
deep
breath
and
seemed
to
be
mounting
her
courage
or
if
he
needs
to
see
me
could
you
possibly
drive
for
me
i
not
sure
i
up
to
it
hey
i
love
a
chance
to
get
inside
that
place
then
his
eyes
grew
uncertain
but
are
you
sure
you
want
to
go
back
after
what
seems
to
have
happened
to
kristen
you
might
consider
waiting
till
we
find
her
and
ally
are
you
all
right
jennifer
was
walking
in
carrying
a
manila
folder
you
look
kind
of
queasy
can
i
make
you
some
tea
or
something
thanks
but
not
now
she
said
i
feeling
weird
but
maybe
i
should
call
out
to
the
institute
and
see
what
van
de
vliet
says
just
do
agree
to
do
anything
until
we
talk
stone
said
do
worry
she
said
reaching
for
the
phone
the
number
for
the
dorian
institute
was
now
newly
entered
on
her
palm
pilot
and
she
called
it
when
the
receptionist
answered
she
gave
her
name
and
asked
for
van
de
vliet
i
was
there
this
morning
and
gave
a
blood
sample
to
debra
connolly
i
do
know
if
there
any
connection
but
i
really
feeling
strange
right
now
what
do
you
mean
by
the
woman
asked
can
you
describe
how
you
feel
exactly
he
in
the
lab
downstairs
that
just
it
i
not
sure
i
need
to
actually
see
him
i
just
like
to
talk
to
him
he
does
like
to
be
disturbed
unless
it
something
very
important
it
important
enough
for
me
to
try
to
call
him
she
declared
feeling
herself
abruptly
seething
i
weak
and
dizzy
and
my
stomach
is
not
in
such
great
shape
either
what
did
you
have
for
lunch
my
god
she
realized
she
had
actually
had
any
after
the
disaster
with
kristen
she
been
in
such
turmoil
that
she
had
even
thought
about
food
on
the
other
hand
she
knew
what
food
deprivation
felt
like
this
was
something
else
i
did
have
all
that
much
lunch
but
that
not
the
problem
now
will
you
please
put
me
through
let
me
see
what
i
can
do
she
said
i
call
down
and
ask
him
he
might
be
able
to
see
you
ally
listened
as
the
line
went
blank
that
was
when
she
remembered
she
had
some
smoked
turkey
in
the
office
fridge
maybe
a
quick
sandwich
was
called
for
while
she
waited
stone
was
looking
around
the
offices
taking
everything
in
carrying
the
phone
she
walked
out
and
followed
him
what
she
wondered
was
the
place
telling
him
about
her
the
meager
furniture
was
and
utilitarian
with
lots
of
beige
and
dark
brown
and
there
were
several
huge
storage
files
for
blueprints
and
designs
there
also
was
a
comfortable
easy
chair
and
lamp
near
a
bookcase
in
the
corner
on
the
table
next
to
the
chair
were
two
british
mysteries
and
a
thick
recently
written
history
of
new
york
city
he
walked
over
and
picked
it
up
it
was
pages
long
this
your
idea
of
reading
for
relaxation
he
asked
waving
it
at
her
i
tried
to
get
through
it
but
i
only
got
up
to
the
and
then
i
started
having
a
bout
of
acute
sleeping
sickness
every
time
i
picked
it
up
hey
the
history
of
this
city
is
a
mental
hobby
of
mine
it
always
renewing
itself
she
smiled
think
about
it
when
developers
convert
industrial
space
to
residential
we
end
up
getting
a
lot
of
work
then
she
heard
the
phone
crackle
alive
it
was
van
de
vliet
alexa
what
seems
to
be
the
problem
she
told
him
then
i
think
it
important
that
you
come
back
out
here
as
soon
as
you
can
i
ca
say
anything
until
i
seen
you
this
could
be
something
that
could
affect
your
procedure
but
what
do
you
think
i
do
diagnose
over
the
phone
i
was
about
to
go
home
but
i
wait
for
you
she
listened
as
he
clicked
off
shit
what
did
he
say
stone
asked
he
said
i
got
to
come
out
do
you
really
want
to
do
that
i
do
know
but
what
the
point
of
going
to
a
doctor
here
they
would
know
then
at
least
let
me
drive
you
stone
declared
and
i
make
damned
sure
they
do
pull
something
funny
ally
jennifer
said
you
look
absolutely
wiped
out
before
you
do
anything
at
least
let
me
fix
you
a
sandwich
i
think
there
some
turkey
in
the
fridge
i
was
thinking
about
that
she
glanced
at
stone
you
want
something
sure
i
have
whatever
you
having
do
be
so
sure
jen
can
tell
you
i
take
mayo
and
mustard
both
i
know
it
weird
but
that
the
way
i
am
then
i
give
it
a
try
i
want
to
get
to
know
you
all
over
again
also
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
think
maybe
i
ought
to
swing
by
the
apartment
and
get
some
things
just
in
case
she
listened
to
her
own
voice
and
wondered
would
whatever
happened
to
kristen
happen
to
me
too
maybe
she
thought
what
i
really
ought
to
take
with
me
is
a
gun
maybe
katherine
starr
had
the
right
idea
jennifer
finished
the
sandwiches
and
was
wrapping
them
ally
i
go
with
you
to
your
place
and
pick
up
knickers
she
can
stay
with
me
till
you
know
what
going
on
thanks
jen
i
was
hoping
you
volunteer
she
knew
she
could
have
dropped
a
hint
and
made
it
happen
anyway
but
this
was
nicer
she
then
went
around
and
had
a
few
last
words
it
felt
like
a
and
she
did
want
it
to
but
it
did
ten
minutes
later
while
stone
waited
in
her
car
she
and
jennifer
took
the
elevator
up
to
her
barrow
street
apartment
where
did
you
find
that
man
jennifer
asked
as
soon
as
they
got
on
he
seems
nice
interesting
he
not
a
client
is
he
and
pardon
me
for
noticing
no
wedding
ring
he
actually
found
me
ally
declared
punching
her
floor
it
a
long
story
but
he
was
a
guy
i
was
deeply
in
love
with
for
about
fifteen
minutes
back
around
college
the
old
flame
i
told
you
about
remember
then
we
started
getting
on
each
other
nerves
we
both
going
easy
on
the
personal
details
right
now
but
i
got
a
hunch
he
got
nobody
else
percolating
which
incidentally
goes
for
me
too
or
had
you
noticed
they
stepped
off
the
elevator
and
she
unlocked
the
door
to
her
apartment
knickers
exploded
with
delight
hi
baby
she
reached
down
and
ruffled
the
sheepdog
ears
i
really
love
her
jennifer
said
as
she
reached
down
to
pet
her
too
knickers
began
a
dance
of
joy
then
ran
to
search
for
her
rubber
ball
behind
the
couch
hoping
for
a
game
of
fetch
with
jennifer
by
the
way
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
appreciate
your
taking
her
going
to
love
being
at
your
place
awhile
i
sure
she
gets
bored
crazy
being
here
all
the
time
i
probably
should
get
a
puppy
or
something
to
keep
her
company
but
then
she
be
jealous
and
i
not
about
to
get
a
stupid
cat
she
loves
me
because
she
knows
i
love
her
jennifer
said
i
always
play
with
her
when
you
bring
her
into
the
office
at
least
i
think
she
loves
me
this
may
turn
out
to
be
the
test
ally
headed
into
the
bedroom
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
some
black
sweatshirts
those
and
black
jeans
were
her
favorite
things
to
wear
around
the
house
she
slept
in
a
and
panties
so
it
was
hard
to
put
together
her
evening
ensemble
besides
if
something
went
wrong
with
the
experimental
stem
cell
procedure
it
would
matter
a
damn
what
she
was
wearing
she
threw
the
clothes
into
a
blue
gym
bag
and
headed
for
the
bathroom
to
fetch
some
toiletries
by
the
time
she
got
back
to
the
living
room
jennifer
had
a
measuring
cup
and
was
shoveling
science
diet
into
a
large
plastic
bag
they
delivered
jen
and
knickers
back
to
the
office
after
she
gave
them
both
a
farewell
hug
she
came
around
and
slipped
into
the
driver
seat
moving
stone
across
i
actually
feeling
better
now
so
i
drive
as
long
as
i
can
and
by
the
way
i
famished
how
about
that
turkey
sandwich
thought
you
never
remember
five
minutes
later
they
were
headed
up
the
west
side
with
ally
at
the
wheel
she
checked
the
gas
and
was
relieved
to
see
that
she
still
had
of
a
tank
stone
was
leaning
back
in
the
seat
looking
at
her
you
know
it
easy
for
me
to
say
but
trying
the
stem
cell
procedure
on
your
heart
is
probably
the
right
thing
for
you
to
do
still
though
it
makes
me
nervous
if
there
a
medical
glitch
of
some
kind
then
i
mean
what
the
hell
is
going
on
with
kristen
i
going
to
confront
him
about
that
she
said
i
damned
well
want
some
answers
before
i
just
turn
myself
over
to
him
after
they
crossed
the
george
washington
bridge
she
began
feeling
slightly
better
maybe
she
thought
whatever
it
is
is
going
to
pass
as
they
headed
north
up
the
highway
she
decided
to
ask
him
a
question
that
had
been
nagging
at
her
mind
stone
i
know
you
hate
to
have
these
talks
but
something
about
you
does
quite
compute
for
me
right
now
there
a
kind
of
unnatural
intensity
about
your
pursuit
of
winston
bartlett
and
his
stem
cell
work
and
the
same
goes
for
his
reaction
to
you
way
back
when
i
never
really
thought
i
knew
you
and
it
still
true
i
mean
is
this
all
just
about
a
book
on
stem
cell
technology
or
is
it
something
more
the
question
was
followed
by
a
long
moment
of
silence
as
he
looked
away
into
the
forest
and
appeared
to
wrestle
with
his
thoughts
you
very
intuitive
ally
he
said
at
last
maybe
i
consciously
set
out
to
write
about
stem
cells
just
because
i
knew
bartlett
gerex
corporation
was
a
leader
in
the
field
but
writing
about
stem
cells
automatically
meant
that
i
have
to
get
close
to
him
at
some
point
so
was
it
an
unconscious
choice
if
it
was
then
i
would
be
aware
of
it
would
i
but
why
would
you
want
to
get
close
to
winston
bartlett
i
guess
that
was
your
original
question
right
pretty
much
there
are
things
about
my
past
that
i
never
told
you
i
could
never
decide
exactly
how
to
go
about
it
and
truthfully
right
now
seem
exactly
the
right
moment
either
you
got
enough
on
your
mind
want
to
give
me
a
hint
what
could
he
mean
she
wondered
it
was
clear
that
stone
aimes
and
winston
bartlett
had
some
kind
of
holy
war
going
on
between
them
i
tell
you
someday
soon
but
i
want
us
both
sitting
down
in
a
safe
place
when
i
do
it
going
to
be
hard
he
looked
away
again
someday
soon
i
got
to
tell
my
daughter
amy
too
maybe
telling
you
would
be
a
practice
drill
so
what
i
learning
is
that
i
not
crazy
this
is
about
more
than
it
about
she
sighed
nobody
leveling
with
me
with
van
de
vliet
i
have
to
worry
whether
he
telling
me
the
truth
every
time
he
opens
his
mouth
and
now
you
holding
out
it
like
that
joke
about
feeling
like
a
mushroom
everybody
keeps
me
in
the
dark
and
feeds
me
bullshit
she
was
slowing
down
pulling
into
an
open
space
by
the
roadside
stone
i
feeling
a
little
dizzy
maybe
it
this
conversation
but
i
think
it
time
you
took
the
wheel
for
a
while
hey
do
pass
out
on
me
now
he
said
snapping
into
the
moment
i
not
sure
i
could
actually
find
this
place
without
your
help
do
worry
she
said
bringing
the
car
to
a
stop
i
all
right
i
just
a
little
worried
about
my
reflexes
he
got
out
and
walked
around
while
she
hoisted
herself
over
into
the
other
side
the
evening
commute
had
begun
in
earnest
so
there
was
a
lot
more
traffic
than
there
had
been
that
morning
but
stone
turned
out
to
be
an
aggressive
driver
right
on
the
edge
as
though
he
were
racing
the
clock
she
gave
him
directions
and
then
closed
her
eyes
hoping
to
rest
but
all
she
could
think
about
was
stone
refusal
to
tell
her
about
something
that
loomed
very
large
in
his
life
tell
me
if
i
bothering
you
and
i
shut
up
he
interjected
after
a
few
minutes
but
not
to
change
the
subject
did
you
actually
give
anybody
permission
to
stick
a
needle
in
you
this
morning
i
mean
are
you
sure
you
understood
what
was
going
on
at
the
time
she
shifted
and
opened
her
eyes
looking
straight
ahead
truthfully
i
assumed
i
was
just
giving
a
blood
sample
that
what
his
assistant
said
and
i
took
her
at
her
word
i
hate
needles
and
i
never
actually
watch
when
i
give
blood
this
morning
i
just
sort
of
went
along
with
what
was
happening
and
nothing
seemed
particularly
ominous
till
katherine
starr
showed
up
and
started
blasting
away
well
he
said
do
your
best
to
get
some
rest
and
i
try
to
get
you
there
as
soon
as
legally
possible
she
stared
out
the
window
a
moment
before
closing
her
eyes
again
around
them
the
encroaching
greenery
of
northern
new
jersey
felt
like
an
ancient
forest
where
magical
things
could
happen
out
here
in
the
forest
was
there
a
magician
who
had
the
power
literally
to
save
her
life
and
what
about
stone
setting
aside
the
troubling
fact
that
he
was
harboring
some
mysterious
connection
to
winston
bartlett
and
that
was
hard
to
set
aside
she
was
feeling
a
sense
of
togetherness
with
him
that
brought
back
a
lot
of
positive
memories
which
was
bizarre
because
she
knew
so
little
about
what
kind
of
man
he
become
if
people
are
worth
their
salt
they
change
a
lot
in
their
late
twenties
and
early
thirties
so
what
was
he
really
like
now
what
did
he
love
what
did
he
hate
what
were
his
priorities
did
he
believe
in
the
golden
rule
mulling
over
all
this
she
slowly
drifted
away
dusk
was
approaching
by
the
time
he
pulled
to
a
stop
at
the
gated
entrance
of
the
dorian
institute
along
the
way
he
begun
getting
a
sense
that
they
were
being
followed
by
a
lincoln
town
car
but
it
could
have
been
his
imagination
and
he
had
seen
it
for
the
past
fifteen
minutes
after
he
pulled
onto
the
leafy
lakeside
drive
leading
to
the
institute
hey
we
here
ally
rise
and
shine
how
you
feeling
there
was
no
response
when
he
touched
her
chapter
april
jesus
ally
are
you
all
right
he
leaned
over
and
shook
her
finally
she
jumped
and
then
her
eyelids
fluttered
open
where
she
looked
around
the
sign
says
this
is
it
the
institute
oh
shit
stone
i
feeling
really
strange
she
said
after
a
moment
of
getting
her
bearings
everything
around
me
seems
like
it
moving
it
as
though
the
space
i
in
has
an
extra
dimension
i
do
know
maybe
it
was
totally
stupid
to
come
back
out
here
maybe
i
should
have
just
gone
to
my
doctor
in
the
city
hey
you
got
a
seriously
deficient
sense
of
timing
we
here
now
i
been
breaking
the
speed
limit
for
the
last
half
hour
i
know
shit
i
really
do
know
what
to
do
i
do
trust
anybody
well
you
could
start
by
trusting
me
i
along
to
try
to
make
sure
nothing
bad
happens
he
paused
so
what
do
we
do
a
brass
plaque
on
a
redbrick
pillar
beside
the
gate
bore
a
high
inscription
the
dorian
institute
and
just
below
it
was
an
intercom
she
stared
at
it
for
a
moment
then
said
there
give
it
a
buzz
i
think
there
a
video
camera
around
here
somewhere
last
time
i
was
here
they
knew
i
arrived
he
reached
out
and
touched
a
black
button
yes
came
back
a
quick
voice
she
recognized
it
as
belonging
to
the
woman
she
spoken
to
on
the
phone
it
alexa
hampton
she
leaned
over
we
talked
yes
i
know
hampton
he
been
waiting
for
you
a
buzzer
sounded
and
the
two
gates
slid
back
welcoming
them
as
they
drove
down
the
road
an
elegant
redbrick
structure
with
white
doric
columns
across
the
front
slowly
came
into
view
from
here
it
pretty
stone
declared
sizing
it
up
i
know
his
big
campus
is
right
down
the
road
but
still
it
sure
feels
godforsaken
and
lost
out
here
in
the
middle
of
these
pines
it
like
the
place
is
hiding
from
the
world
where
better
to
do
secret
medical
research
she
said
if
you
want
to
keep
everything
proprietary
then
the
isolation
gives
you
a
big
jump
on
security
she
directed
him
to
the
side
parking
lot
where
she
left
her
car
that
morning
stone
here
what
we
tell
them
you
next
of
kin
a
cousin
on
my
mother
side
works
for
me
he
declared
i
beginning
to
feel
part
of
the
family
anyway
he
pocketed
the
car
keys
and
helped
her
out
of
the
toyota
as
they
headed
up
the
wide
steps
past
the
white
columns
ally
felt
a
wave
of
nausea
sweep
through
her
she
reached
out
and
took
stone
arm
and
sank
against
him
i
i
not
feeling
at
all
well
please
let
me
hold
no
sooner
had
she
said
it
than
the
front
door
opened
and
two
nurses
appeared
their
hair
backlit
from
the
glow
of
the
reception
area
she
recognized
one
as
ellen
here
dear
let
us
help
you
she
said
as
she
strode
toward
them
she
was
dressed
in
white
and
her
eyes
were
flooded
with
concern
ally
looked
through
the
doorway
to
see
a
waiting
wheelchair
that
fast
stone
said
looks
like
they
were
ready
for
you
my
god
she
thought
did
they
already
know
what
kind
of
shape
i
be
in
what
else
do
they
know
surely
van
de
vliet
has
heard
by
now
that
i
aware
of
kristen
then
she
saw
him
standing
behind
the
nurses
alexa
we
need
to
get
you
downstairs
as
soon
as
possible
he
was
coming
forward
to
help
her
settle
into
the
wheelchair
he
appeared
to
take
no
notice
of
stone
aimes
i
just
feeling
a
little
dizzy
he
smiled
reassuringly
there
always
a
small
percentage
chance
that
there
may
be
side
effects
from
the
initial
inoculation
huh
what
inoculation
she
bolted
upright
in
the
wheelchair
i
was
just
supposed
to
be
giving
blood
i
thought
debra
explained
he
said
appearing
confused
always
an
initial
antibiotic
dosage
just
as
a
prophylactic
he
shook
his
head
in
i
should
have
insisted
you
stay
here
but
after
that
incident
this
morning
i
was
so
disoriented
i
let
you
talk
me
out
of
it
you
may
be
having
a
reaction
to
the
antibiotic
but
it
ca
be
all
that
serious
i
did
see
anything
about
side
effects
in
your
file
we
just
have
to
get
you
horizontal
for
a
while
everything
going
to
be
all
right
in
fact
this
might
be
a
positive
development
with
you
here
now
we
can
begin
your
procedure
immediately
van
de
vliet
this
is
my
cousin
stone
he
drove
me
here
and
i
i
really
like
to
stay
stone
said
reaching
to
shake
van
de
hand
it
would
mean
a
lot
to
both
of
us
to
the
whole
family
family
van
de
vliet
declared
ally
noticed
that
he
was
examining
stone
with
narrowed
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
debating
something
with
himself
well
we
see
then
he
turned
back
to
her
the
first
thing
is
to
make
sure
your
situation
is
stabilized
i
actually
think
a
good
night
rest
might
do
the
trick
but
i
need
to
run
a
quick
blood
test
downstairs
she
felt
her
dizziness
coming
and
going
but
she
was
determined
to
stay
awake
and
in
control
of
what
was
being
done
to
her
by
the
way
i
was
wondering
how
is
katherine
starr
doing
his
eyes
grew
somber
she
a
very
lucky
woman
considering
given
her
some
coagulants
and
stitched
her
up
are
you
going
to
press
charges
he
looked
at
her
strangely
do
you
think
we
should
i
guess
it
none
of
my
business
of
course
you
wo
she
told
herself
the
kristen
matter
will
not
stand
the
ordinary
light
of
day
let
alone
a
police
investigation
maybe
it
time
to
let
her
daughter
come
and
see
her
i
looked
at
that
letter
he
said
with
a
tone
i
suspect
it
a
hoax
and
a
very
cruel
one
at
that
i
do
think
so
i
talked
to
her
today
the
woman
formerly
known
as
kristen
on
the
phone
she
stared
at
him
i
really
think
it
time
i
learned
more
about
what
happened
to
her
here
at
the
institute
all
i
could
really
find
out
was
that
she
thinks
she
experienced
some
pretty
dramatic
memory
loss
he
looked
as
though
this
information
was
new
to
him
he
also
looked
startled
you
spoke
to
her
what
did
she
say
is
she
all
right
no
she
not
all
right
do
mention
the
kidnapping
she
told
herself
play
dumb
and
see
how
he
behaves
i
want
to
know
what
happened
to
her
when
she
was
here
he
paused
then
took
a
deep
breath
i
told
you
everything
i
know
this
morning
she
was
a
very
troubled
young
person
her
treatment
seemed
to
be
going
well
but
she
could
accept
that
she
began
to
believe
there
was
some
kind
of
conspiracy
against
her
in
a
word
she
became
completely
paranoid
well
ally
thought
there
paranoid
and
then
there
are
times
when
somebody
really
is
out
to
get
you
so
which
was
it
in
kristen
case
she
glanced
over
at
stone
who
appeared
to
be
trying
to
act
as
though
he
did
know
what
on
earth
she
was
talking
about
but
she
could
see
him
efficiently
taking
mental
notes
when
you
ca
remember
who
you
are
she
said
turning
back
to
van
de
vliet
and
then
someone
who
does
know
who
you
are
gives
you
a
new
fake
identity
i
think
it
enough
to
justify
paranoia
he
was
rolling
the
wheelchair
toward
the
elevator
but
abruptly
paused
is
that
what
she
claiming
good
god
i
told
you
she
was
paranoid
and
that
should
demonstrate
it
better
than
anything
letting
her
discharge
herself
and
leave
the
program
to
go
off
unsupervised
was
a
truly
bad
idea
but
nothing
short
of
physical
restraint
could
have
stopped
her
and
do
you
have
any
idea
where
she
is
now
ally
asked
i
told
you
look
if
i
knew
her
whereabouts
do
you
think
do
everything
i
could
to
contact
her
find
out
how
she
is
right
she
reached
out
and
took
stone
hand
as
they
all
moved
onto
the
elevator
she
could
sense
his
excitement
at
finally
being
inside
the
dorian
institute
but
at
that
moment
her
concentration
was
drifting
and
she
felt
as
though
she
were
slowly
beginning
to
drown
in
a
sea
of
white
stone
please
do
leave
me
do
let
me
out
of
your
sight
something
funny
is
happening
and
i
do
know
what
it
is
van
de
vliet
bent
over
alexa
look
at
me
i
want
to
see
your
eyes
i
think
they
may
be
dilating
he
waved
a
hand
across
her
face
can
you
see
me
it
the
fluorescent
lights
she
mumbled
there
too
much
glare
could
someone
please
turn
them
down
i
think
that
what
wrong
they
giving
me
a
headache
ally
stone
said
the
lights
are
not
very
bright
in
here
going
down
in
an
elevator
there
are
any
fluorescents
then
the
elevator
chimed
and
the
door
opened
they
were
in
the
basement
now
where
the
research
lab
and
the
office
and
the
examination
rooms
were
debra
wearing
a
white
lab
coat
was
standing
there
silently
looking
at
her
now
there
really
were
fluorescent
lights
and
she
turned
away
and
tried
to
shield
her
eyes
god
turn
them
off
it
so
painful
it
like
they
shining
into
the
back
of
my
skull
she
started
hallucinating
van
de
vliet
whispered
to
debra
got
to
draw
blood
for
a
test
and
give
her
an
injection
we
need
a
gurney
now
we
got
to
take
her
down
to
the
ic
her
condition
is
progressing
much
more
rapidly
than
i
expected
ally
is
this
what
you
want
stone
demanded
you
do
have
to
do
this
her
breath
was
coming
in
rapid
pulses
now
and
she
was
cringing
from
the
light
even
as
she
struggled
to
rise
out
of
the
wheelchair
i
want
to
get
she
managed
to
pull
herself
onto
her
feet
but
then
she
sagged
and
collapsed
against
stone
as
he
pulled
her
to
him
as
one
of
the
nurses
grabbed
the
newly
arrived
gurney
and
pulled
it
over
van
de
vliet
and
ellen
seized
her
out
of
stone
arms
and
lifted
her
onto
it
you
have
to
leave
now
van
de
vliet
said
to
stone
i
sorry
i
not
going
anywhere
i
promised
her
i
stay
by
her
side
and
by
god
i
intend
to
do
just
that
i
determine
what
best
for
her
he
replied
please
go
up
to
the
reception
area
i
let
you
know
how
she
is
i
not
leaving
then
i
call
our
security
and
have
you
removed
from
the
premises
stone
ally
said
her
eyelids
flickering
it
okay
i
want
you
to
tell
my
mother
i
here
she
in
room
upstairs
the
last
time
i
saw
her
you
got
it
do
worry
i
take
care
of
everything
she
heard
him
saying
that
but
then
she
thought
she
heard
another
voice
inside
her
head
begging
him
not
to
leave
it
was
the
last
thought
she
had
before
the
world
went
entirely
white
april
watched
the
scene
with
mounting
dismay
she
overheard
van
de
vliet
talking
to
debbie
about
the
procedure
scheduled
for
alexa
hampton
then
she
checked
the
schedule
that
had
been
put
into
the
database
it
turned
out
that
alexa
hampton
had
two
procedures
scheduled
the
troubling
part
was
one
was
identical
to
the
procedure
that
had
been
performed
on
kristen
starr
several
months
back
or
at
least
so
it
seemed
and
that
had
resulted
in
what
she
just
overheard
debra
call
the
syndrome
by
whatever
name
it
had
produced
some
horrible
side
effects
why
on
earth
were
they
now
repeating
that
with
this
new
patient
had
they
learned
anything
karl
van
de
vliet
or
whoever
ordered
this
idiotic
travesty
was
about
to
put
the
job
of
every
person
at
the
dorian
institute
at
risk
if
whatever
happened
to
kristen
was
replicated
and
the
word
got
out
it
was
going
to
be
the
end
for
everyone
who
worked
here
most
troubling
of
all
what
about
hampton
who
seemed
like
such
a
nice
person
did
she
agree
to
that
experimental
procedure
if
she
knew
what
had
happened
to
kristen
starr
surely
she
would
have
ellen
did
know
how
she
could
stop
vee
from
doing
what
he
appeared
to
be
planning
to
do
the
procedure
was
going
to
be
performed
in
the
laboratory
the
only
way
she
could
think
of
to
stop
it
was
to
try
to
warn
hampton
that
what
they
were
about
to
do
was
extremely
dangerous
but
how
her
chart
in
the
database
said
they
were
going
to
keep
her
quarantined
down
in
the
basement
that
was
specified
on
top
of
all
this
kenji
noda
had
brought
in
some
unidentified
patient
this
afternoon
wheeled
in
while
strapped
to
a
gurney
and
they
had
taken
that
patient
to
the
subbasement
noda
was
still
down
there
and
winston
bartlett
had
come
in
and
gone
down
also
the
unholy
pair
and
now
they
be
holding
alexa
hampton
down
there
too
was
it
possible
to
get
past
them
and
warn
her
she
was
determined
to
find
a
way
chapter
april
stone
was
deeply
troubled
as
he
entered
the
elevator
to
return
to
the
lobby
he
had
promised
ally
he
stay
by
her
side
and
now
he
let
her
down
was
this
the
best
he
could
do
he
felt
like
he
had
to
earn
the
right
to
be
back
in
her
life
but
he
seemed
to
be
making
a
slow
start
but
he
was
about
to
leave
the
premises
until
he
knew
she
was
okay
hoping
for
the
best
he
reminded
himself
that
although
van
de
vliet
was
wound
pretty
tight
he
clearly
was
more
than
competent
the
problem
was
he
just
offered
a
transparent
song
and
dance
when
ally
asked
him
about
kristen
now
it
was
easy
to
understand
why
she
said
she
know
whether
to
believe
a
word
he
said
but
that
did
necessarily
preclude
him
being
a
nobel
medical
genius
in
any
case
to
finally
be
inside
the
dorian
institute
was
a
major
coup
in
his
own
quest
up
until
now
bartlett
press
heavies
at
bmd
had
turned
back
his
every
attempt
to
get
a
look
at
the
institute
or
an
interview
with
karl
van
de
vliet
now
at
last
he
actually
seen
the
man
so
after
he
visited
with
ally
mother
upstairs
which
ought
to
be
interesting
an
actual
patient
interview
he
was
going
to
try
to
keep
a
low
profile
and
scout
the
place
maybe
he
could
finally
talk
his
way
into
an
interview
with
the
celebrated
van
de
vliet
himself
or
at
least
with
some
of
his
research
staff
this
was
definitely
the
break
been
waiting
for
finally
he
have
some
actual
reporting
to
put
in
the
book
when
he
stepped
off
the
elevator
he
noticed
that
the
uniformed
security
guard
looked
him
over
suspiciously
he
and
alexa
had
been
waved
through
the
metal
detector
when
they
came
in
owing
to
the
urgency
of
her
condition
now
he
felt
as
though
the
guard
a
tall
black
guy
with
thinning
hair
was
trying
to
frisk
him
with
his
penetrating
eyes
stone
smiled
and
nodded
toward
him
and
headed
for
the
desk
in
the
middle
of
the
reception
area
around
him
a
number
of
patients
were
ambling
through
the
lobby
returning
from
a
room
in
the
back
that
was
identified
as
dining
hall
some
were
wearing
blue
gowns
and
most
appeared
to
be
in
their
sixties
and
seventies
but
they
all
were
sprightly
and
animated
as
they
walked
along
chatting
somehow
the
place
felt
more
like
a
vacation
spa
than
a
clinic
he
like
nothing
better
than
to
sit
them
all
down
right
this
minute
for
an
interview
how
has
the
gerex
stem
cell
procedure
affected
your
condition
have
you
had
any
side
effects
but
to
do
that
without
official
permission
would
undoubtedly
get
him
evicted
on
the
spot
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
walked
over
to
the
reception
desk
hi
the
woman
looked
up
she
was
the
same
hispanic
nurse
with
bold
eye
makeup
who
was
there
when
they
came
in
hi
how
your
friend
feeling
actually
she
my
cousin
and
i
do
know
how
she
doing
because
they
kicked
sent
me
up
here
but
she
gave
me
a
mission
to
keep
me
occupied
well
the
woman
declared
with
a
smile
i
sure
she
be
fine
van
de
vliet
is
a
miracle
worker
so
everyone
says
he
smiled
back
my
cousin
asked
me
to
look
in
on
her
mother
nina
hampton
she
is
or
was
in
hampton
is
your
aunt
uh
yeah
right
whoops
get
this
act
together
funny
but
i
always
just
think
of
her
as
my
cousin
ally
mother
my
own
weird
way
to
look
at
it
i
guess
i
do
really
know
her
all
that
well
things
are
not
getting
off
to
a
great
start
he
told
himself
i
even
believe
me
visits
to
patients
except
by
those
on
a
list
require
a
photo
id
well
let
get
started
he
reached
for
his
wallet
and
withdrew
a
driver
license
he
made
sure
his
press
card
was
well
out
of
sight
keep
this
dumb
and
innocent
as
long
as
possible
he
told
himself
she
glanced
at
the
driver
license
then
pointed
to
the
sheet
just
sign
your
name
and
print
it
and
then
also
print
your
relationship
to
the
patient
i
have
to
say
this
is
unusual
there
are
regular
visiting
hours
and
guests
are
normally
approved
in
advance
by
young
who
in
charge
of
security
but
you
came
in
under
extraordinary
circumstances
with
hampton
and
you
already
here
so
i
see
the
harm
he
signed
himself
in
as
quickly
as
possible
hampton
is
still
in
room
i
show
myself
up
please
keep
it
under
fifteen
minutes
we
do
want
to
tire
her
out
you
understand
thanks
i
really
appreciate
this
my
cousin
ally
likes
to
get
an
update
on
he
realized
he
had
momentarily
blocked
her
mother
name
her
mom
as
often
as
possible
he
headed
for
the
elevator
trying
to
contain
his
excitement
the
idea
was
to
keep
this
as
below
the
radar
as
possible
was
he
about
to
crack
the
wall
of
secrecy
that
winston
bartlett
had
erected
around
karl
van
de
vliet
and
the
gerex
corporation
just
as
the
elevator
door
was
closing
he
saw
a
figure
emerge
through
the
security
entryway
the
man
clicked
a
from
somewhere
in
the
past
but
he
could
place
him
as
best
he
could
tell
the
guy
did
see
him
just
keep
moving
do
look
back
as
he
stepped
off
the
elevator
onto
the
second
floor
the
pale
marble
floors
were
lit
by
small
bulbs
along
the
walls
this
was
a
place
where
medical
miracles
were
supposedly
being
made
to
happen
and
yet
it
was
lit
only
with
a
ghostly
the
sounds
of
televisions
emanated
from
several
of
the
rooms
the
nurse
station
at
the
end
of
the
hall
was
empty
which
added
to
the
sense
of
a
surreptitious
undertaking
he
walked
quickly
to
room
and
tapped
lightly
on
the
door
when
he
heard
a
bold
yes
from
inside
he
opened
it
and
entered
he
had
seen
nina
hampton
in
almost
two
decades
but
she
looked
pretty
much
the
way
he
remembered
her
her
hair
was
surely
dyed
now
but
her
face
was
as
square
and
strong
as
ever
she
was
reading
a
paperback
book
with
a
tide
that
appeared
to
be
spanish
she
looked
up
and
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
adjusting
her
glasses
hello
stone
that
is
you
is
it
you
older
but
you
still
a
hell
of
a
looker
how
did
you
get
in
here
is
ally
here
too
i
seen
her
since
this
morning
hampton
do
tell
me
you
recognize
me
of
course
i
do
when
you
and
ally
were
going
out
i
confess
i
did
hold
out
much
hope
that
you
ever
amount
to
anything
but
been
a
fan
of
your
columns
for
a
long
time
though
it
took
me
a
while
to
put
it
together
that
that
newspaper
writer
i
liked
so
much
was
you
the
man
i
did
think
was
ambitious
enough
for
my
daughter
she
appraised
him
a
moment
does
this
mean
you
two
are
together
again
good
question
he
thought
and
i
do
have
a
clue
about
the
answer
i
wish
i
knew
why
do
you
ask
her
the
next
time
you
see
her
he
smiled
and
walked
over
she
wanted
me
to
come
up
and
see
how
doing
come
up
is
she
here
now
when
she
came
to
say
goodbye
this
morning
i
got
the
impression
that
she
wanted
both
of
us
just
to
get
out
of
here
but
i
told
her
that
was
silly
i
already
feeling
so
much
better
really
well
she
downstairs
now
and
she
be
happy
to
hear
that
he
walked
over
and
smiled
hampton
i
came
along
with
her
this
time
to
keep
an
eye
on
her
hope
you
do
mind
of
course
not
and
there
another
reason
i
here
i
want
to
warn
you
i
writing
a
book
about
stem
cell
procedures
and
anything
you
say
to
me
about
your
treatment
could
well
end
up
in
it
so
do
tell
me
anything
you
want
everybody
to
hear
about
are
you
really
writing
a
book
about
dr
vee
she
beamed
wonderful
he
a
saint
everyone
here
says
so
he
deserves
a
special
place
in
heaven
this
is
great
stone
thought
i
got
my
own
deep
throat
then
could
i
ask
you
what
you
know
about
what
he
did
and
how
you
think
you
improved
i
do
really
understand
what
he
doing
but
i
do
know
what
is
happening
to
me
it
as
though
my
mind
was
full
of
fog
a
lot
of
the
time
but
now
there
a
wind
that
blowing
it
away
and
how
a
shaft
of
light
from
the
hallway
pierced
across
the
room
as
the
door
opened
stone
turned
to
see
the
man
he
first
noticed
in
the
lobby
the
man
walked
past
him
and
marched
over
to
the
bed
hi
how
you
feeling
i
touched
her
visage
immediately
hardened
it
thoughtful
of
you
to
finally
come
by
and
favor
your
mother
with
a
visit
that
who
he
is
stone
finally
realized
ally
kid
brother
in
his
few
dealings
with
the
wiseass
brat
that
ally
used
to
rant
about
what
was
the
kid
name
right
grant
he
found
him
devious
and
pompous
he
was
particularly
deft
at
cutting
ethical
corners
and
using
other
people
any
way
he
could
stone
nina
hampton
said
gesturing
toward
grant
this
is
i
know
exactly
who
he
is
grant
said
turning
around
to
face
stone
has
put
out
an
alert
for
you
pal
you
got
a
hell
of
a
nerve
weaseling
your
way
in
here
but
not
to
worry

wo
be

long
i
wo
have
you
talking
that
way
in
my
presence
young

nina

civil
tongue

head
grant
replied
without
taking
his
eyes
off
stone

lied
to
the
front
desk
nina
he
signed
in
as
ally
cousin
and
that
down
there
let
him

using
a
lie

me

creative
this
man
came
with
your

expressly
forbidden

now
let
go
with
no
option
short
of
killing
him
on
the
spot
stone
followed
along
seething
this
little
creep
obviously
works
for
winston
bartlett
he
wished
ally
had
warned
him
about
that
grant
was
bound
to
have
shown
up
at
some
point
they
went
down
the
marble
staircase
and
grant
signaled
the
security
man
who
leaped
up
and
opened
the
front
door
for
them
he
probably
got
a
from
grant
stone
told
himself
as
they
stepped
onto
the
wide
porch
dusk
all
around
them
grant
turned
and
headed
toward
the
south
end
and
a
long
wooden
bench
want
to
tell
me
what
the
hell
going
on
he
said
gesturing
toward
the
bench
and
then
sitting
down
said
you
claimed
to
be
writing
a
book
about
this
project
if
that
true
then
it
a
seriously
bad
idea
you
have
no
idea
what
he
capable
of
if
he
gets
pissed
oh
i
think
i
getting
a
rough
idea
but
i
a
little
pissed
too
stone
said
remaining
standing
for
example
there
the
matter
of
kristen
starr
you
see
she
was
terminated
from
the
clinical
trials
approximately
three
months
back
so
i
was
wondering
when
is
van
de
vliet
planning
to
report
her
current
condition
to
the
nih
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
his
startled
voice
said
otherwise
oh
i
think
you
do
i
saw
her
today
then
he
decided
to
bluff
she
had
an
interesting
tale
to
tell
she
shit
you
interviewed
kristy
aw
man
do
believe
anything
she
he
hesitated
what
did
she
say
about
tell
you
what
we
play
twenty
questions
you
tell
me
what
you
think
she
said
and
i
tell
you
if
you
right
or
not
hey
grant
declared
his
eyes
intense
she
wanted
to
do
it
man
nobody
put
a
gun
to
her
head
or
anything
she
was
freaking
out
after
she
got
sacked
she
thought
vee
could
fix
her
skin
and
she
wait
to
try
it
you
mean
the
beta
take
a
look
at
van
de
vliet
he
a
walking
testimonial
no
side
effects
for
him
so
why
not
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
would
be
nothing
right
so
she
figured
what
did
she
have
to
lose
well
now
we
all
know
the
beta
that
you
fucker
grant
bounded
to
his
feet
you
do
know
the
first
thing
about
what
i
talking
about
do
you
how
the
fuck
did
you
find
out
about
kristen
anyway
i
told
you
i
spoke
to
her
well
it
was
almost
true
he
yelled
at
her
she
very
unsettled
just
now
but
i
guess
you
know
that
hey
she
was
always
but
liked
all
the
energy
behind
that
he
looked
right
past
the
eating
disorders
and
the
coke
and
the
clubs
she
went
to
all
the
time
but
man
if
you
think
spaced
try
her
mother
that
crazy
grant
why
not
level
with
me
there
something
very
wrong
going
on
here
i
in
the
business
of
telling
the
truth
and
i
got
a
keen
nose
for
medical
so
how
about
coming
clean
if
it
good
why
not
and
if
it
bad
it
going
to
come
out
eventually
anyway
has
winston
bartlett
learned
anything
from
all
the
in
washington
it
not
the
situation
it
the
well
i
do
know
what
kristy
did
or
did
tell
you
so
we
not
going
in
that
direction
i
heard
about
her
little
trip
downtown
this
morning
i
assume
that
probably
when
you
saw
her
if
in
fact
you
actually
did
right
now
she
being
taken
care
of
for
her
own
good
taken
care
of
so
happens
i
had
a
close
encounter
with
a
couple
of
her
caregivers
today
they
taking
care
of
her
all
right
look
she
used
to
be
girlfriend
okay
he
still
very
concerned
about
her
everybody
really
sorry
about
her
situation
but
nobody
saw
it
coming
and
now
he
got
some
problems
of
his
own
you
seem
to
be
pretty
heavily
involved
with
winston
personal
problems
yeah
well
the
man
been
like
a
father
to
me
and
i
think
he
feels
that
way
too
since
he
does
have
a
son
of
his
own
stone
let
the
taunt
just
hang
in
the
air
for
a
moment
he
mainly
just
wanted
to
slug
the
smug
little
bastard
you
do
know
how
little
you
know
about
him
or
about
anything
someday
i
may
take
the
trouble
to
straighten
you
out
but
right
now
you
not
worth
the
effort
all
i
care
about
at
the
moment
is
going
to
happen
to
ally
everybody
cares
what
happens
to
her
a
lot
depends
on
it
vee
thinks
she
our
best
shot
what
what
the
hell
are
you
talking
about
stone
stared
at
him
through
the
twilight
what
depends
on
it
guess
you
not
as
smart
as
you
think
you
are
he
was
up
and
heading
for
the
parking
lot
come
on
pal
time
to
hit
the
road
i
gon
na
tuck
you
in
this
conversation
is
terminated
and
it
never
happened
anyway
i
have
them
unlock
the
gates
for
you
chapter
april
alexa
watches
as
the
prow
of
their
morgan
cuts
silently
through
a
placid
sea
she
vaguely
remembers
the
vessel
it
was
teak
and
magnificent
steve
had
chartered
it
for
two
weeks
and
taken
them
cruising
through
the
bahamas
by
the
end
of
that
time
she
felt
they
could
have
sailed
it
around
the
world
but
that
was
six
years
ago
when
he
was
still
very
much
alive
now
the
boat
feels
like
a
magical
carpet
taking
them
someplace
together
effortlessly
the
genoa
the
mainsail
and
the
mizzen
are
all
full
and
blossoming
outward
even
though
there
no
wind
she
at
the
helm
holding
a
course
toward
something
white
on
the
horizon
and
steve
is
with
her
he
alive
again
and
he
with
her
she
feels
her
body
suffused
with
joy
then
she
looks
at
the
reflection
of
herself
in
his
sunglasses
and
realizes
she
a
little
girl
still
a
child
this
is
all
a
dream
she
realizes
a
cruel
dream
then
she
looks
again
at
the
horizon
the
blazing
white
light
and
senses
that
it
represents
the
future
their
destiny
now
the
sea
around
them
which
had
been
placid
starts
to
roil
the
wheel
is
becoming
harder
to
control
and
the
sun
is
starting
to
burn
her
in
its
pitiless
glare
she
feels
herself
beginning
to
age
rapidly
she
glances
at
steve
and
she
can
see
his
skin
starting
to
shrivel
she
senses
he
is
dying
right
there
before
her
eyes
but
her
hands
feel
glued
to
the
wheel
and
she
ca
let
go
to
try
to
help
him
now
the
sea
is
growing
ever
more
choppy
and
the
white
symbol
on
the
horizon
has
begun
to
bob
in
and
out
of
view
sometimes
she
can
see
the
future
and
sometimes
she
ca
waves
are
crashing
over
the
sides
inundating
the
deck
and
she
feels
anxious
about
what
lies
up
ahead
will
they
ever
get
there
and
if
they
do
will
she
want
what
she
finds
even
more
important
now
will
steve
still
be
with
her
as
the
waves
pound
against
them
both
oddly
she
does
feel
wet
instead
what
she
feels
is
a
stab
of
muted
pain
in
her
upper
chest
pain
she
knows
would
be
searing
if
she
were
to
experience
its
full
impact
she
looks
down
to
see
that
the
wheel
she
thought
she
was
holding
is
gone
and
her
chest
is
pierced
by
the
steel
mechanism
to
which
it
was
attached
it
has
gone
all
the
way
through
her
next
a
huge
wave
comes
straight
over
the
bow
and
slams
against
her
and
steve
her
body
convulses
with
pain
and
she
senses
that
he
is
being
swept
overboard
directly
off
the
stern
she
screams
at
him
to
hold
on
but
then
he
is
gone
lost
in
the
dark
sea
now
the
boat
itself
is
starting
to
disintegrate
as
both
masts
tip
backwards
then
come
crashing
down
up
ahead
the
white
light
that
is
the
future
is
growing
ever
more
it
is
part
of
a
shoreline
she
is
trying
to
reach
but
now
she
does
think
she
going
to
get
there
around
her
the
boat
lines
and
cleats
are
being
swept
into
the
pounding
sea
in
moments
the
boat
has
disappeared
but
she
continues
on
propelled
by
some
force
she
can
not
see
until
she
finally
crashes
onto
the
rocky
shore
it
is
a
chiaroscuro
landscape
of
blacks
and
whites
oddly
stone
aimes
has
appeared
and
is
holding
her
hand
as
they
make
their
way
along
the
barren
seascape
where
everything
is
hazy
and
trapped
in
fog
she
thinks
she
sees
figures
lurking
in
the
mist
around
them
but
ca
make
out
who
they
are
everything
is
static
and
frozen
in
place
like
the
images
of
motion
on
the
grecian
urn
caught
for
eternity
she
reaches
out
to
touch
stone
and
her
hand
passes
right
through
that
when
she
realizes
the
white
light
and
this
rocky
shoreline
represent
the
other
side
is
this
what
death
feels
like
she
wonders
like
the
white
tunnel
drawing
you
in
but
then
she
has
another
thought
maybe
she
is
dead
at
all
maybe
she
is
in
a
third
place
somewhere
suspended
between
life
and
death
she
looks
again
at
stone
and
tells
herself
they
not
dead
they
in
some
kind
of
time
machine
this
voyage
is
about
time
now
time
has
begun
to
flow
around
her
like
a
river
days
weeks
months
years
they
all
course
by
but
she
knows
it
is
a
chimera
nothing
can
make
time
go
faster
or
slower
then
the
bright
lights
are
gone
and
she
feels
alone
very
alone
but
she
is
she
hears
voices
around
her
drifting
echoing
and
she
tries
to
understand
what
they
are
saying
she
stabilized
we
past
the
critical
phase
do
you
want
to
bring
her
up
now
not
yet
we
still
do
know
how
it
going
to
go
there
was
a
pause
and
then
a
male
voice
this
was
the
beta
too
was
it
karl
another
pause
well
it
the
injections
that
the
first
time
since
again
the
voices
drift
off
she
listens
not
sure
what
she
is
hearing
she
tries
to
process
the
word
beta
but
makes
no
headway
in
computer
slang
beta
means
a
program
that
is
still
being
tested
then
she
remembers
hearing
the
word
just
hours
earlier
she
had
been
talking
to
some
woman
but
she
ca
remember
who
i
changed
the
procedure
this
time
comes
a
voice
i
injected
the
special
beta
enzyme
separately
from
the
activated
stem
cells
whatever
happens
will
happen
at
the
enzyme
own
pace
now
and
i
kept
the
dosage
as
low
as
i
could
we
be
monitoring
her
telomerase
levels
throughout
the
day
if
there
no
rejection
we
will
be
past
the
first
phase
is
the
dosage
the
only
difference
from
before
comes
the
other
accusing
voice
at
this
point
david
manipulating
the
beta
is
an
art
not
a
science
i
just
attempting
to
create
antigens
the
way
a
smallpox
vaccination
does
then
we
try
to
harvest
them
this
is
not
really
a
beta
procedure
i
do
plan
to
do
that
ever
again
there
was
another
long
silence
that
man
who
was
here
with
her
her
cousin
did
he
say
i
saw
no
family
resemblance
but
he
seemed
very
upset
that
why
i
had
him
sent
upstairs
i
think
he
the
reporter
was
so
concerned
about
anyway
he
gone
stone
she
realizes
that
who
they
talking
about
and
now
gone
she
on
her
own
next
the
voices
drift
away
for
a
time
into
some
echo
space
that
mutes
them
finally
though
they
come
back
this
should
be
adequate
for
another
four
hours
after
that
need
a
glucose
iv
to
keep
her
hydrated
i
already
put
it
on
her
chart
by
then
we
should
have
some
idea
of
which
way
this
is
going
i
thinking
i
praying
that
this
time
is
going
to
be
the
charm
that
i
learned
how
to
modulate
the
enzyme
is
she
ready
for
transfer
to
ic
anytime
the
voices
start
drifting
away
a
fuzziness
is
enveloping
her
senses
leaving
everything
soft
and
muted
the
pain
is
gone
from
her
body
now
and
the
bright
lights
around
her
seem
to
be
dimming
the
figures
in
the
white
haze
on
the
perimeter
are
now
disappearing
one
by
one
as
though
filing
out
of
a
room
and
now
she
feels
like
she
floating
with
things
moving
past
her
then
finally
one
lone
voice
is
talking
to
her
is
really
talking
to
her
in
a
private
and
unmistakable
way
and
as
she
drifts
back
into
the
gulf
of
anesthesia
she
listens
to
words
that
do
not
make
a
lot
of
sense
the
fountain
through
all
the
ages
we
been
looking
in
the
wrong
place
it
within
us
together
alexa
we
have
this
chance
she
listens
as
the
voice
begins
to
drift
away
yet
she
feels
a
genuine
sense
of
closeness
to
it
she
realizes
she
no
longer
has
control
of
her
destiny
but
still
she
wants
to
be
where
she
is
now
the
sea
is
coming
back
flowing
around
her
and
she
tries
to
remember
where
she
is
and
why
but
all
she
is
aware
of
is
the
sea
rising
until
she
is
engulfed
chapter
april
stone
awoke
in
his
yorkville
apartment
nursing
a
hangover
and
a
lot
of
regrets
he
inhaled
a
triple
scotch
after
driving
ally
toyota
back
and
parking
it
on
the
street
the
night
before
he
needed
it
yesterday
had
been
a
day
where
in
sequential
order
he
seen
a
woman
who
lost
her
memory
get
kidnapped
probably
he
been
fired
from
his
day
job
he
finally
gotten
inside
the
dorian
institute
only
to
blow
the
opportunity
completely
but
the
most
important
thing
that
happened
was
he
rediscovered
a
woman
he
once
been
in
love
with
and
he
currently
did
have
the
slightest
idea
what
was
happening
to
her
thinking
back
over
their
last
few
moments
together
when
she
was
being
checked
in
by
van
de
vliet
and
his
research
team
and
he
was
being
hastily
sent
up
to
the
lobby
stone
suspected
that
ally
was
about
to
be
subjected
to
something
they
did
want
anybody
to
know
about
now
he
was
determined
to
get
back
inside
the
institute
and
look
out
for
her
as
he
pulled
himself
out
of
bed
and
shakily
made
his
way
into
the
kitchen
to
start
the
coffee
he
was
trying
to
decide
where
to
begin
as
it
happened
he
now
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
he
did
mind
all
that
much
losing
his
position
at
the
sentinel
come
on
that
was
writ
across
the
sky
but
he
particularly
regretted
being
denied
the
pleasure
of
quitting
on
his
own
terms
complete
with
a
flamboyant
farewell
speech
to
the
managing
editor
jay
he
actually
been
rehearsing
it
for
weeks
the
dream
of
just
showing
up
at
the
dorian
institute
and
walking
in
was
no
longer
even
a
fantasy
there
was
a
special
not
welcome
mat
out
for
him
even
more
than
the
first
time
he
need
a
calling
card
that
had
to
be
kristen
starr
she
clearly
held
the
key
to
whatever
it
was
winston
bartlett
and
karl
van
de
vliet
were
trying
to
cover
up
but
how
to
find
her
the
only
real
lead
he
had
was
the
apartment
she
come
back
to
apparently
returning
like
a
genetically
programmed
salmon
going
back
upstream
but
not
really
knowing
why
okay
why
not
go
back
down
there
and
look
around
again
only
do
it
thoroughly
he
and
ally
had
had
time
to
do
much
more
than
a
cursory
the
specter
of
the
knives
in
the
walls
still
haunted
him
but
how
to
get
in
then
he
remembered
that
ally
had
been
given
the
key
by
kristen
spacey
subtenant
cindy
the
one
who
was
renting
the
apartment
did
she
leave
that
key
at
her
citispace
office
or
did
she
put
it
on
her
key
ring
her
car
keys
were
lying
on
the
table
by
the
door
where
he
tossed
them
last
night
he
walked
over
and
checked
them
out
there
were
several
house
keys
on
the
ring
in
addition
to
her
toyota
keys
could
she
have
put
kristen
key
on
the
ring
too
or
did
she
stash
it
in
her
desk
at
citispace
swing
by
the
apartment
and
try
these
he
decided
maybe
i
get
lucky
as
he
headed
for
the
shower
a
cup
of
black
jamaican
coffee
in
hand
he
thought
again
about
the
last
thing
alexa
brother
grant
had
said
something
about
how
alexa
was
their
best
shot
whatever
that
meant
it
could
be
good
by
nine
he
had
showered
shaved
and
was
in
ally
toyota
headed
for
west
eleventh
street
as
he
turned
right
on
fourteenth
he
had
a
fresh
idea
kristen
phone
was
still
working
at
least
as
of
yesterday
so
did
she
have
speed
dial
a
memory
bank
of
numbers
that
could
be
a
gold
mine
of
the
people
closest
to
her
but
if
not
there
were
other
tricks
ways
of
getting
phone
information
there
might
even
be
information
in
the
phone
itself
who
do
you
get
on
redial
and
who
do
you
get
with
the
last
number
that
dialed
in
the
last
number
that
dialed
in
would
probably
be
the
japanese
guy
who
left
a
message
and
then
kidnapped
her
but
the
last
call
out
could
be
interesting
he
had
a
nagging
feeling
that
this
was
the
best
way
to
be
spending
his
morning
but
he
could
immediately
think
of
anything
else
west
eleventh
street
was
comparatively
empty
so
he
had
no
trouble
securing
a
parking
space
after
he
turned
off
the
engine
he
looked
at
ally
key
set
again
well
there
were
four
other
keys
on
it
besides
the
toyota
keys
give
it
a
shot
he
got
out
and
locked
the
car
and
walked
up
the
steps
it
was
a
perfect
spring
morning
cool
and
crisp
and
this
part
of
the
village
was
quiet
and
residential
he
found
himself
envying
the
owners
of
these
beautiful
town
houses
there
was
something
so
dignified
and
secure
about
them
then
he
saw
a
man
emerge
from
the
apartment
below
the
stoop
just
a
few
feet
from
where
he
was
standing
hi
how
cindy
he
called
down
hoping
the
social
gesture
would
let
the
guy
know
he
was
about
to
do
a
story
number
on
town
house
the
man
who
looked
to
be
in
his
late
twenties
was
dressed
in
a
black
suit
with
long
blond
hair
tied
back
in
a
ponytail
and
carried
a
shoulder
bag
that
appeared
to
be
serving
as
a
briefcase
he
stared
at
stone
with
a
puzzled
look
who
i
was
here
yesterday
and
a
woman
named
cindy
friend
of
kristen
said
she
was
leasing
the
garden
apartment
i
was
just
wondering
i
sorry
maybe
you
have
the
wrong
address
i
had
this
place
for
almost
a
year
and
a
half
now
he
was
moving
on
down
the
street
as
he
called
back
over
his
shoulder
good
luck
what
the
hell
is
going
on
he
looked
up
and
checked
the
number
yep
it
cindy
had
definitely
gone
into
that
apartment
yesterday
and
talked
convincingly
about
living
there
and
working
at
the
e
station
she
even
had
keys
to
kristen
place
so
who
the
hell
was
that
guy
he
looked
back
but
now
he
had
disappeared
did
i
just
imagine
that
he
puzzled
he
moved
up
the
steps
to
the
heavy
white
wood
door
and
started
trying
keys
the
first
one
would
enter
the
lock
nor
would
the
second
the
third
key
entered
but
would
not
turn
okay
last
chance
he
inserted
the
fourth
and
it
seemed
to
stick
but
he
gave
it
a
wiggle
and
he
was
in
thanks
ally
but
when
he
stepped
through
the
door
and
switched
on
the
light
he
could
only
stare
in
disbelief
the
apartment
had
been
completely
cleared
out
the
white
walls
which
had
been
covered
with
knifed
photos
of
kristen
only
yesterday
were
now
blank
even
the
few
pieces
of
furniture
were
gone
jesus
i
do
believe
this
his
voice
echoed
off
the
empty
marble
mantelpiece
and
bounced
across
the
room
he
looked
around
since
late
yesterday
somebody
had
come
in
and
cleaned
out
the
place
thoroughly
any
hopes
of
finding
old
letters
an
address
book
anything
personal
were
gone
he
knew
immediately
that
he
had
been
outsmarted
kristen
starr
and
now
her
friend
cindy
had
officially
ceased
to
exist
cindy
might
still
be
at
e
but
she
was
going
to
be
terrified
and
subject
to
massive
memory
loss
on
the
subject
of
kristen
but
wait
a
second
they
left
the
phone
the
answering
machine
is
gone
but
maybe
they
did
realize
that
phones
can
have
memories
and
can
sometimes
tell
tales
that
might
be
worth
a
try
but
check
out
the
place
first
he
walked
into
the
kitchen
alcove
and
gazed
around
not
entirely
sure
what
he
was
looking
for
the
main
thing
would
be
some
phone
numbers
and
addresses
he
opened
the
refrigerator
and
peered
in
it
was
still
running
and
contained
two
unopened
jars
of
british
marmalade
and
an
empty
quart
jar
with
traces
of
orange
juice
bordered
by
mold
the
freezer
compartment
was
entirely
bare
the
two
kitchen
cabinets
above
the
stove
had
been
similarly
emptied
he
gave
them
a
cursory
look
then
came
back
and
followed
a
hallway
to
a
bathroom
in
the
back
when
he
opened
the
medicine
chest
above
the
sink
and
peered
in
he
initially
thought
it
was
empty
with
a
pile
of
kleenex
on
the
bottom
shelf
he
was
pulling
that
out
when
he
realized
that
the
tissue
had
been
wadded
around
an
empty
prescription
drug
vial
kristen
starr
had
prescription
number
it
was
for
libinol
whatever
that
was
probably
some
kind
of
diet
pill
and
it
had
been
filled
five
months
ago
it
had
been
delivered
from
grove
pharmacy
on
seventh
avenue
to
here
west
eleventh
street
the
address
was
pasted
on
a
sticker
on
the
back
hmmm
he
thought
after
she
left
rather
than
transferring
the
prescription
what
if
they
just
had
subsequent
refills
delivered
to
some
other
address
there
a
long
shot
that
grove
pharmacy
might
have
a
new
address
for
the
prescription
number
okay
it
would
be
a
very
long
shot
but
still
unless
of
course
her
new
address
had
been
the
dorian
institute
in
that
case
the
prescription
would
undoubtedly
have
been
discontinued
once
she
became
a
patient
he
reached
for
his
cell
phone
to
call
the
drugstore
shit
i
forgot
it
damn
hangover
he
walked
back
into
the
living
room
and
stared
at
kristen
phone
if
it
was
still
working
he
could
call
grove
pharmacy
and
no
idiot
that
would
wipe
out
any
number
stored
in
the
redial
function
without
a
cell
the
best
thing
to
do
is
just
go
over
there
and
check
with
the
pharmacist
in
person
he
settled
onto
the
hardwood
floor
next
to
the
phone
and
stared
at
it
what
if
the
line
is
already
disconnected
why
did
whoever
cleaned
this
place
out
leave
it
here
the
phone
of
all
things
it
it
rang
he
jumped
a
foot
off
the
floor
and
then
stared
at
it
a
series
of
reasons
flashed
through
his
mind
they
know
i
here
and
they
going
to
warn
me
again
to
back
off
they
know
i
here
and
the
last
incoming
call
here
was
from
a
number
they
do
want
me
to
know
about
i
pick
this
up
and
i
wipe
out
any
chance
of
ever
finding
out
what
it
was
do
answer
it
this
phone
call
is
not
intended
to
be
helpful
not
picking
up
the
phone
was
the
hardest
thing
he
ever
done
but
he
was
determined
to
be
disciplined
he
counted
eleven
rings
and
then
he
could
take
it
anymore
and
reached
for
the
receiver
it
stopped
thank
god
his
hand
froze
in
midair
the
timing
had
been
a
second
salvation
all
right
he
thought
time
to
find
out
if
i
just
totally
screwed
up
time
to
dial
he
got
his
pen
and
notebook
poised
and
then
lifted
the
black
receiver
he
knew
from
the
message
on
her
machine
yesterday
that
somebody
had
called
her
just
before
he
got
there
or
maybe
whoever
came
and
cleaned
out
her
apartment
had
received
a
phone
call
while
they
were
here
possibly
from
whoever
sent
them
a
checkup
call
who
knew
but
give
it
a
shot
he
hit
the
code
a
mechanical
voice
came
on
immediately
your
last
call
was
from
area
code
number
if
you
would
like
for
me
to
connect
you
please
push
go
for
it
he
said
aloud
scribbling
down
the
number
and
then
following
the
instruction
at
that
moment
somebody
cell
phone
began
to
ring
just
outside
the
front
door
oh
shit
it
was
just
too
big
a
coincidence
after
two
rings
it
stopped
and
he
heard
the
voice
of
winston
bartlett
both
outside
the
front
door
and
in
his
ear
yes
he
was
too
startled
to
respond
but
he
did
need
to
because
an
instant
later
he
also
heard
the
sound
of
a
key
and
then
the
front
door
opened
a
shaft
of
daylight
shot
across
the
room
as
bartlett
took
one
look
and
exploded
damn
so
it
true
how
the
hell
did
hey
come
on
in
stone
said
trying
to
recover
some
poise
and
take
marginal
control
of
the
situation
i
here
by
permission
the
downstairs
tenant
who
you
just
evicted
or
kidnapped
too
gave
me
her
key
you
do
get
it
do
you
i
told
you
to
keep
but
we
have
signs
of
progress
i
know
all
about
kristen
well
that
was
hardly
the
case
but
it
never
hurt
to
start
off
with
a
bluff
to
see
how
far
you
could
get
that
why
i
here
the
question
is
when
are
we
going
to
start
talking
to
each
other
because
i
putting
together
a
hell
of
a
story
i
do
fucking
believe
this
bartlett
slammed
the
door
by
the
way
a
special
thanks
for
getting
me
sacked
at
the
sentinel
now
i
have
the
leisure
to
concentrate
on
the
stem
cell
book
and
gerex
i
warned
you
but
you
would
fucking
listen
he
was
peering
around
the
living
room
as
though
searching
for
clues
to
explain
why
nothing
was
going
right
like
i
said
i
talked
to
kristen
yesterday
stone
stood
his
ground
she
not
a
happy
person
if
you
bring
her
into
this
bartlett
glared
at
him
i
imagine
what
makes
you
think
you
can
just
run
roughshod
through
my
business
and
my
life
here
how
it
is
you
can
abuse
me
or
you
can
use
me
keep
in
mind
i
accustomed
to
working
for
people
who
buy
ink
by
the
barrel
as
i
tried
to
explain
before
if
you
wo
let
me
get
at
the
whole
truth
i
may
end
up
spreading
bartlett
walked
across
the
room
and
ran
his
fingers
along
the
marble
mantelpiece
above
the
fireplace
you
know
he
said
turning
back
up
until
now
you
never
asked
me
for
anything
i
have
to
say
i
always
admired
that
but
i
curious
why
maybe
i
thought
it
was
your
place
to
come
to
me
stone
said
puzzled
by
the
left
turn
the
conversation
had
suddenly
taken
you
know
i
have
a
life
of
my
own
i
have
an
daughter
you
never
seen
or
apparently
care
to
see
i
wondering
what
that
says
about
you
your
granddaughter
name
by
the
way
is
i
know
her
name
i
know
quite
a
bit
about
our
blood
ties
or
lack
of
well
i
bet
she
be
just
thrilled
by
that
incidentally
she
does
know
a
goddam
thing
about
you
and
i
just
as
soon
keep
it
that
way
i
knew
having
this
conversation
was
a
fucking
mistake
this
is
why
i
never
had
it
any
real
son
of
mine
has
got
to
have
some
of
my
character
my
stature
you
a
bean
counter
if
you
had
any
character
you
would
be
hiding
behind
all
this
secrecy
i
try
to
tell
the
truth
as
much
and
as
often
as
i
can
my
take
on
character
what
we
doing
at
gerex
is
going
to
change
the
history
of
the
world
we
at
the
brink
of
things
mankind
has
only
dreamed
about
and
taken
all
the
risks
in
fact
i
took
the
biggest
risk
of
all
personally
there
a
lot
going
on
that
you
do
know
a
damned
thing
about
we
on
the
edge
of
all
the
more
reason
you
should
want
the
whole
story
told
stone
interjected
yes
stem
cell
technology
is
going
to
change
everything
but
you
ca
just
tell
half
the
story
i
want
it
to
work
but
i
a
truth
seeker
i
want
to
find
out
what
if
anything
can
go
wrong
too
you
been
using
people
first
kristen
and
now
i
beginning
to
fear
ally
to
take
your
risks
for
you
i
mean
what
going
on
why
did
you
send
somebody
down
to
obliterate
all
evidence
of
kristen
and
now
cindy
that
girl
downstairs
my
god
she
somehow
vanished
too
whatever
happened
to
kristen
to
make
it
come
to
this
what
may
or
may
not
have
gone
wrong
is
nothing
that
ca
be
made
right
no
great
medical
advance
ever
succeeded
in
a
direct
line
i
do
need
the
sales
pitch
stone
said
i
agree
it
going
to
revolutionize
medicine
but
you
ca
that
why
you
never
be
a
son
of
mine
you
always
think
small
this
is
about
more
than
mere
medicine
it
about
doing
the
one
thing
mankind
has
never
been
able
to
do
i
am
this
close
nothing
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
destroy
this
chance
not
even
you
my
own
flesh
and
blood
am
i
that
stone
asked
feeling
an
unexpected
satisfaction
your
own
and
blood
that
is
something
bartlett
said
we
are
about
to
discover
whether
we
are
made
of
the
same
thing
the
best
way
for
you
to
understand
what
going
on
here
is
to
do
what
i
done
have
the
beta
procedure
show
me
you
got
the
balls
the
procedure
it
might
help
if
i
knew
what
it
is
why
do
i
just
show
you
bartlett
said
you
want
to
be
on
the
inside
see
everything
up
close
fine
i
think
the
time
has
come
you
seem
determined
to
stick
your
nose
into
what
i
doing
you
weaseled
your
way
into
the
institute
and
now
you
show
up
here
so
i
guess
time
you
were
an
insider
all
the
way
good
maybe
then
i
can
start
getting
some
answers
for
example
was
changing
kristen
name
part
of
the
nih
study
stone
turned
to
face
him
or
is
it
your
way
to
hide
one
of
your
mistakes
quite
frankly
that
none
of
your
goddam
business
well
let
me
tell
you
what
is
my
business
ally
hampton
is
a
particular
friend
of
mine
i
damned
well
want
to
know
whether
scheduled
to
undergo
the
same
procedure
as
kristen
i
do
know
what
you
and
van
de
vliet
did
to
kristen
but
if
you
turn
ally
into
a
zombie
too
i
personally
i
think
we
continue
this
discussion
later
he
pulled
his
cell
phone
out
of
a
jacket
pocket
flipped
it
open
and
punched
a
memory
number
ken
could
you
and
jake
please
come
in
we
have
the
problem
i
was
afraid
we
had
he
flipped
the
phone
shut
and
turned
back
to
stone
karl
entered
hampton
and
her
mother
into
the
clinical
trials
at
the
last
minute
as
a
special
favor
she
in
no
danger
now
stone
saw
two
men
come
through
the
front
door
one
was
the
tall
japanese
man
who
had
slugged
him
the
day
before
shit
i
need
this
is
he
going
to
work
me
over
again
the
other
guy
was
dressed
in
white
as
though
he
were
an
orderly
or
nurse
stone
noticed
he
had
a
plastic
syringe
in
his
right
hand
ken
could
you
and
jake
please
take
care
of
this
he
be
going
with
us
stone
examined
the
three
of
them
well
he
thought
guess
i
going
to
be
back
inside
the
dorian
institute
after
all
look
there
no
need
for
excessive
violence
here
we
could
just
set
some
ground
rules
for
this
situation
the
japanese
man
named
ken
walked
over
and
seized
him
around
the
neck
while
at
the
same
time
pulling
his
right
arm
around
behind
him
a
decisive
hammerlock
you
fucker
stone
choked
out
let
the
man
bartlett
had
called
jake
the
one
in
white
shoved
a
needle
into
his
arm
this
could
be
the
experience
you
been
looking
for
bartlett
said
you
been
pursuing
me
like
a
dog
chasing
a
car
now
we
about
to
see
if
you
man
enough
to
handle
the
consequences
when
you
caught
it
you
damned
right
i
handle
it
he
tried
to
say
but
he
was
sure
if
he
actually
got
it
said
the
void
was
closing
in
so
fast
chapter
april
grant
is
that
you
ally
squinted
in
the
of
the
room
finally
making
out
the
silhouette
he
was
sitting
in
a
chair
beside
her
bed
and
his
face
was
troubled
reminding
her
of
when
he
had
a
bad
day
in
high
school
am
i
dreaming
again
she
puzzled
the
clock
on
the
wall
told
her
that
this
was
a
late
hour
for
whatever
he
was
up
to
now
it
me
he
said
his
voice
low
just
above
a
whisper
the
door
behind
him
she
noticed
was
shut
welcome
back
to
the
world
they
moved
you
upstairs
just
for
tonight
this
is
the
first
chance
i
had
to
get
near
you
she
was
still
wondering
where
she
was
what
day
it
was
the
walls
were
an
icy
blue
illuminated
only
by
the
glow
of
the
bank
of
crt
screens
that
now
monitored
her
heart
and
her
respiration
she
lifted
her
head
off
the
pillow
and
for
a
moment
looked
past
grant
examining
the
screen
of
the
heart
monitor
it
was
a
phonocardiogram
she
knew
what
to
look
for
over
the
years
she
learned
to
interpret
every
irregular
pulse
every
errant
amplitude
but
now
the
sonic
abnormalities
that
typically
characterized
her
stenosis
the
struggle
of
her
heart
scarred
valve
to
maintain
adequate
coronary
output
were
significantly
damped
there
always
been
murmurs
abnormal
heart
sounds
as
long
as
she
could
remember
so
what
did
this
mean
had
the
damaged
valve
already
begun
restoring
and
strengthening
itself
while
she
slept
or
was
this
just
more
of
some
dream
why
was
she
in
this
hospital
anyway
hooked
up
to
monitors
she
still
could
remember
exactly
what
she
tried
to
rise
up
out
of
the
bed
again
she
wondered
was
grant
real
or
some
chimera
then
she
realized
she
was
strapped
in
though
the
straps
were
held
only
with
black
velcro
as
she
started
to
pull
them
open
she
noticed
she
had
an
iv
needle
in
her
arm
with
a
plastic
tube
that
led
to
a
bag
of
liquid
suspended
from
a
hook
above
her
head
more
annoying
however
was
the
checkerboard
of
sensors
on
her
upper
body
for
the
ongoing
phonocardiogram
she
looked
at
all
the
tubes
and
connected
wires
and
felt
like
a
laboratory
animal
in
the
middle
of
an
experiment
ally
you
at
the
dorian
institute
remember
van
de
stem
cell
clinical
trials
nina
here
too
oh
that
rang
a
bell
sort
of
what
what
day
is
it
he
told
her
you
been
under
sedation
since
late
yesterday
ally
but
vee
says
your
test
data
show
you
responding
mom
here
right
now
things
were
starting
to
come
back
how
she
doing
is
she
he
talking
about
discharging
her
by
the
end
of
next
week
even
before
the
nih
clinical
trials
are
officially
over
grant
tried
a
smile
by
then
he
thinks
the
procedure
will
have
replaced
enough
tissue
in
her
brain
that
she
might
not
even
need
a
caregiver
doing
crosswords
again
need
i
say
more
my
god
now
she
remembered
how
nina
mind
had
been
when
she
brought
her
out
to
the
institute
had
she
really
been
given
a
second
chance
and
so
quickly
if
so
it
was
truly
astonishing
but
now
she
found
herself
staring
at
grant
mesmerized
something
about
him
seemed
oddly
off
grant
what
what
going
on
with
you
i
he
was
hesitating
i
been
thinking
about
everything
now
i
really
wish
i
had
done
what
i
did
what
are
you
talking
about
this
kind
of
revisionist
remorse
sound
like
the
grant
she
knew
have
you
seen
kristen
they
said
you
know
about
her
were
asking
about
her
then
he
stepped
back
do
you
know
about
her
kristen
she
tried
to
remember
is
that
the
woman
everybody
her
mother
had
come
to
the
institute
with
a
pistol
trying
to
find
her
then
she
was
kidnapped
it
the
syndrome
grant
went
on
she
wanted
the
beta
procedure
and
vee
finally
agreed
but
nobody
expected
anything
to
happen
like
what
eventually
did
that
why
went
ahead
and
had
it
too
beta
now
she
remembered
that
kristen
had
mumbled
something
about
that
word
ally
i
got
you
into
when
i
told
that
i
thought
you
and
he
had
the
same
rare
blood
type
ab
he
wanted
to
bring
you
into
the
program
you
mean
for
my
heart
he
looked
away
and
his
eyes
grew
pained
well
that
part
of
it
there
another
part
they
have
told
you
about
what
that
antibodies
they
think
there
a
chance
you
could
be
made
to
develop
them
and
then
they
could
use
them
to
help
he
does
have
the
syndrome
yet
but
it
probably
just
a
matter
of
time
what
she
puzzled
is
he
talking
about
what
antibodies
what
syndrome
she
was
weak
and
she
was
sure
her
mind
was
fully
functional
but
after
what
appeared
to
be
the
miracle
of
her
heart
she
was
willing
to
forsake
a
certain
amount
of
momentary
rationality
then
more
memory
started
returning
kristen
what
about
her
i
saw
ally
the
syndrome
started
with
her
over
four
months
ago
at
first
they
did
fully
realize
how
serious
but
now
it
getting
worse
every
day
he
paused
and
turned
away
look
i
been
thinking
really
sorry
that
i
brought
you
into
this
what
if
something
goes
wrong
what
do
you
mean
if
you
could
see
kristen
now
you
understand
where
is
she
is
she
still
wherever
they
hiding
her
no
he
turned
back
kristen
after
what
happened
yesterday
she
had
to
be
brought
back
out
here
there
a
ward
downstairs
on
the
floor
below
the
offices
and
lab
that
kind
of
like
an
unit
that
where
you
were
until
tonight
but
you
ca
go
back
down
there
on
your
own
not
even
the
nurses
can
go
without
a
special
authorization
which
is
never
given
but
if
kristen
is
ally
you
the
one
i
worried
about
i
thought
what
they
were
going
to
do
to
you
was
safe
but
last
night
i
heard
them
all
talking
and
i
think
you
could
be
in
serious
danger
they
do
actually
know
what
the
consequences
of
what
they
doing
will
be
you
need
to
get
out
of
here
and
at
least
get
the
real
story
i
do
want
this
on
my
hands
truthfully
there
could
be
some
deep
legal
shit
coming
out
of
all
this
i
can
think
of
at
least
three
felonies
i
do
want
any
part
of
that
liability
and
i
want
you
to
testify
that
i
got
you
out
of
here
if
it
ever
comes
to
that
finally
the
straight
story
she
thought
he
afraid
he
about
to
be
an
accomplice
in
a
criminal
conspiracy
he
getting
cold
feet
grant
do
something
for
me
get
me
unplugged
all
these
sensors
i
want
to
go
see
her
for
myself
ally
forget
it
to
begin
with
i
ca
unplug
you
only
a
nurse
can
do
that
and
i
do
want
to
you
got
catheters
in
places
i
then
i
get
a
nurse
to
come
and
do
it
i
say
i
need
to
go
to
the
bathroom
that
should
get
me
unhooked
annoyed
she
looked
around
where
the
buzzer
there
has
to
be
one
somewhere
then
she
spotted
a
set
of
controls
attached
to
the
bed
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
red
button
what
else
could
it
be
she
pushed
it
and
a
light
came
on
above
her
door
moments
later
a
short
woman
with
the
name
marion
sewn
into
her
white
uniform
opened
the
door
and
came
striding
in
flicking
on
the
fluorescent
overheads
my
my
we
looking
well
she
declared
ignoring
grant
i
glad
you
finally
awake
he
told
us
to
call
him
the
minute
they
all
saying
you
and
your
mother
must
have
special
genes
you
both
been
such
terrific
patients
he
been
keeping
you
sedated
but
he
discontinued
that
medication
this
afternoon
he
wanted
you
to
wake
up
with
your
mind
clear
well
i
really
like
to
get
up
and
go
to
the
bathroom
and
get
something
to
eat
ally
said
mainly
i
just
want
to
get
out
of
this
bed
for
a
stretch
before
i
start
developing
bedsores
i
feeling
strong
for
now
at
least
can
you
unhook
some
of
these
wires
and
suction
cups
and
i
certainly
do
need
that
iv
i
so
hungry
i
could
inhale
a
quart
of
ice
cream
in
one
gulp
yes
of
course
marion
said
and
began
dismantling
the
intravenous
tubes
we
only
monitor
you
and
hydrate
you
when
you
not
conscious
the
standard
procedure
is
to
let
you
get
up
and
start
getting
some
exercise
as
soon
as
possible
you
should
be
careful
though
because
at
this
point
you
not
as
strong
as
you
think
changes
are
taking
place
in
your
body
that
require
a
lot
of
your
energy
if
you
feel
up
to
it
you
could
walk
around
for
a
couple
of
minutes
but
you
should
let
yourself
get
tired
as
marion
continued
now
removing
the
sensors
ally
looked
up
and
saw
another
uniformed
nurse
standing
in
the
doorway
she
also
was
with
prematurely
gray
hair
and
she
was
holding
a
syringe
may
i
come
in
she
asked
at
this
stage
he
needs
a
blood
sample
every
three
hours
just
twenty
cc
ally
watched
as
the
new
nurse
quickly
and
deftly
took
a
small
sample
of
blood
then
she
capped
it
off
and
turned
to
leave
i
need
to
centrifuge
this
immediately
and
she
was
gone
then
marion
finished
removing
the
iv
tube
and
catheter
and
all
the
electrodes
if
you
want
to
get
up
and
use
the
bathroom
and
walk
around
a
little
i
sure
it
would
be
all
right
i
come
back
in
a
few
minutes
and
bring
you
a
tray
with
a
nice
healthy
bowl
of
broth
the
moment
she
was
out
the
door
ally
turned
to
grant
i
want
to
see
kristen
now
i
thought
the
first
thing
you
wanted
was
to
go
to
the
bathroom
i
get
to
that
you
said
she
was
downstairs
somewhere
how
do
i
get
there
it
in
the
security
zone
he
said
you
not
authorized
you
a
big
shot
around
here
winston
bartlett
flunky
so
why
do
you
authorize
me
yourself
ally
you
know
i
ca
do
that
then
take
me
there
i
do
want
to
see
kristen
anymore
he
declared
biting
his
lip
she
completely
lost
everything
i
could
deal
with
it
until
i
saw
her
this
morning
it
just
too
much
has
he
let
her
mother
see
her
are
you
kidding
letting
that
psycho
anywhere
near
her
is
the
last
thing
anybody
going
to
do
then
get
me
in
dammit
ally
forget
about
it
why
he
hesitated
as
though
marshaling
his
thoughts
sis
he
said
finally
there
only
so
many
risks
i
can
take
for
you
and
they
have
to
be
about
something
that
matters
forget
about
kristen
nothing
can
save
her
now
but
i
offering
to
help
you
get
out
of
here
before
they
go
any
further
i
ca
be
seen
helping
you
but
they
started
you
down
a
road
that
you
do
want
to
go
believe
me
i
got
you
into
this
but
if
there
still
time
i
want
to
try
to
help
get
you
out
she
did
know
what
was
going
on
but
if
grant
of
all
people
was
freaked
about
what
karl
van
de
vliet
had
in
store
for
her
then
maybe
she
better
take
it
seriously
but
she
was
through
relying
on
him
for
anything
okay
but
i
want
to
call
somebody
to
come
and
get
me
are
you
referring
to
that
reporter
by
any
chance
he
asked
the
guy
who
drove
you
here
hates
him
yes
she
was
puzzled
that
he
would
know
about
stone
how
do
you
bartlett
has
him
what
do
you
mean
he
radioactive
now
i
actually
kicked
him
out
of
here
myself
yesterday
this
is
not
a
moment
for
press
freedom
he
could
screw
up
everything
said
he
doing
a
book
no
way
is
that
guy
going
to
be
allowed
human
contact
with
anybody
till
the
sale
of
gerex
is
in
the
bank
he
had
a
with
bartlett
in
the
city
and
they
took
him
somewhere
i
do
know
the
location
and
i
do
want
to
know
oh
my
god
he
most
likely
okay
it
just
temporary
safekeeping
all
the
more
reason
i
not
leaving
till
i
see
kristen
there
no
way
you
going
to
get
into
where
they
keeping
her
ally
all
right
there
was
no
arguing
with
him
when
he
was
this
freaked
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
pulled
a
plastic
card
out
of
his
jacket
pocket
it
was
white
with
the
gerex
corporation
embossed
on
one
side
and
a
magnetic
strip
on
the
other
this
is
a
master
key
to
this
place
because
of
security
you
just
go
out
the
front
through
the
lobby
but
if
you
take
the
elevator
down
to
the
first
floor
of
the
basement
where
the
lab
is
there
a
fire
exit
there
in
the
back
that
opens
onto
a
path
down
to
the
lake
if
you
go
out
that
door
and
wait
right
there
i
come
around
and
get
you
to
the
parking
lot
i
know
a
way
that
will
miss
their
surveillance
cameras
i
scheduled
to
go
back
to
the
city
now
and
take
you
with
me
but
if
i
wanted
to
see
kristen
you
have
to
go
into
the
laboratory
and
then
take
the
elevator
inside
there
do
even
think
about
it
it
way
too
risky
she
looked
at
him
trying
to
gauge
his
sincerity
had
he
become
a
new
man
finally
caring
about
somebody
other
than
himself
or
had
a
glimpse
of
whatever
had
happened
to
kristen
scared
the
hell
out
him
and
awakened
the
specter
of
being
part
of
a
felonious
enterprise
why
are
you
doing
this
to
make
up
for
a
few
things
he
said
turning
to
leave
with
that
he
walked
out
and
quietly
closed
the
door
that
remains
to
be
seen
she
told
herself
she
went
to
the
bathroom
then
put
on
a
bathrobe
and
headed
out
into
the
hallway
the
nurse
station
was
not
occupied
marion
was
still
in
the
kitchen
on
the
first
floor
presumably
good
she
was
feeling
shaky
not
nearly
as
strong
as
she
initially
thought
she
was
but
she
pressed
on
taking
the
elevator
her
first
use
of
grant
gerex
master
key
she
bypassed
the
first
floor
and
an
instant
later
she
was
stepping
into
the
basement
laboratory
area
at
the
moment
it
appeared
to
be
entirely
deserted
though
the
fluorescent
lights
bathed
the
space
in
a
stark
pitiless
light
down
the
hall
was
van
de
vliet
office
and
the
examining
room
where
she
and
her
mother
had
gone
when
they
were
being
admitted
at
this
time
of
night
everything
was
closed
and
probably
locked
she
turned
and
looked
at
the
forbidding
entryway
to
the
laboratory
through
the
transparent
walls
she
could
see
the
dim
glow
of
crt
screens
and
incubators
filled
with
petri
dishes
and
there
at
the
back
was
could
her
eyes
be
trusted
the
outline
of
an
elevator
door
she
had
noticed
it
until
this
minute
it
seemed
to
be
built
with
a
nod
toward
camouflage
it
could
lead
to
kristen
she
told
herself
find
out
what
grant
is
so
freaked
about
he
can
wait
a
couple
of
minutes
she
was
starting
to
feel
even
weaker
but
she
pressed
on
next
to
the
heavy
steel
air
lock
leading
into
the
laboratory
was
a
card
reader
and
she
swiped
the
white
card
through
the
slot
the
air
lock
opened
silent
and
perfunctory
when
she
went
through
the
door
behind
her
automatically
closed
and
then
the
hermetically
sealed
door
in
front
of
her
opened
she
was
in
next
a
bright
fluorescent
light
clicked
on
all
by
itself
jesus
maybe
it
was
connected
to
a
motion
sensor
or
on
a
timer
then
she
looked
around
this
she
thought
is
the
place
where
the
gerex
corporation
has
supposedly
changed
medical
history
what
was
created
in
this
very
room
had
if
grant
was
telling
the
truth
saved
her
sanity
and
if
she
could
believe
the
monitors
she
had
looked
at
in
her
room
her
own
heart
condition
had
begun
to
be
reversed
after
a
lifetime
of
progressive
decline
yet
something
about
it
had
been
pushed
too
far
somewhere
in
the
midst
of
this
miracle
the
gerex
corporation
had
done
something
so
obscene
no
one
could
even
talk
about
it
she
looked
around
the
laboratory
wishing
she
could
understand
what
she
was
seeing
it
smelled
like
solvent
acetone
with
a
mingling
of
more
pungent
fumes
the
black
slate
laboratory
workbenches
were
spotlessly
hygienic
and
equipped
with
several
large
microscopes
that
featured
screens
she
noticed
a
heavy
server
computer
at
the
back
presumably
networked
to
all
the
terminals
in
the
building
and
then
she
remembered
that
van
de
vliet
had
once
spoken
of
computer
simulations
someday
soon
she
told
herself
she
was
going
to
understand
what
really
was
going
on
here
but
for
now
she
headed
for
the
elevator
another
zip
of
grant
white
card
and
the
door
opened
there
was
indeed
a
floor
below
the
laboratory
and
she
pushed
the
button
the
dorian
institute
was
all
about
security
but
this
subbasement
area
was
doubly
secure
after
a
quick
trip
down
the
elevator
door
opened
onto
another
air
lock
chamber
this
an
exit
from
the
pressurized
environment
of
the
laboratory
why
she
wondered
had
no
one
spotted
her
yet
perhaps
this
part
of
the
clinic
was
such
a
lockdown
that
nurses
and
guards
were
necessary
as
she
stepped
from
the
air
lock
she
was
in
a
hallway
she
walked
down
and
tried
the
first
unmarked
door
it
was
locked
but
then
she
saw
the
slot
for
her
card
she
slipped
it
in
and
the
door
opened
automatically
the
room
she
entered
had
a
row
of
beds
each
shrouded
in
a
curtain
as
she
walked
down
the
center
aisle
she
realized
that
only
one
of
the
beds
was
occupied
and
yes
it
was
kristen
she
was
lying
there
and
when
ally
slid
back
the
curtain
her
eyes
clicked
open
startled
hi
do
be
afraid
i
a
friend
she
quietly
finished
drawing
the
curtain
aside
now
the
kristen
starr
was
staring
at
her
with
angry
eyes
the
false
bravado
of
a
frightened
child
and
she
looked
much
younger
than
she
had
in
the
head
shot
she
attached
to
the
walls
of
her
town
house
with
steak
knives
she
said
nothing
for
a
moment
then
she
mouthed
who
are
you
i
talked
to
you
on
the
phone
a
couple
of
days
ago
ally
said
not
sure
herself
exactly
when
it
was
when
you
went
down
to
your
place
on
west
eleventh
street
i
do
know
you
she
mouthed
again
this
time
with
a
slight
whisper
my
name
is
ally
hampton
she
moved
next
to
her
so
she
could
keep
her
voice
down
i
an
interior
designer
i
once
did
an
apartment
for
you
in
chelsea
i
about
to
go
on
a
journey
she
whispered
i
do
remember
you
but
maybe
you
the
one
who
going
with
me
there
was
something
otherworldly
and
chilling
about
her
voice
what
journey
do
you
we
were
going
to
go
away
that
what
he
promised
just
us
two
well
i
ready
i
want
to
go
out
and
play
but
he
does
care
anymore
he
just
wants
me
to
disappear
so
that
what
i
do
only
we
do
it
together
you
and
me
she
reached
up
from
her
bed
and
ran
a
finger
across
ally
face
will
you
take
me
out
of
here
he
promised
me
everything
that
i
could
get
it
all
back
but
now
i
know
he
care
he
was
just
using
me
she
stopped
then
gave
a
cruel
laugh
from
the
back
of
her
throat
but
now
it
going
to
happen
to
him
too
i
can
tell
that
why
he
does
want
to
see
me
anymore
he
does
want
to
see
what
in
store
for
him
what
has
happened
ally
wondered
it
sounds
like
some
kind
of
bizarre
experiment
gone
wrong
wo
you
come
with
me
kristen
went
on
we
go
to
a
place
nobody
has
ever
been
to
before
it
be
just
us
her
seductive
eyes
at
once
plaintive
and
demanding
would
have
lured
anyone
toward
wherever
she
wanted
to
go
for
a
careless
moment
ally
found
herself
wanting
to
follow
them
no
this
is
madness
or
ally
thought
with
horror
is
she
seeing
something
in
me
that
i
ca
see
kristen
listen
to
me
please
i
think
it
very
possible
i
just
had
a
stem
cell
procedure
for
my
heart
i
do
know
if
it
like
what
you
had
but
i
want
to
know
what
happened
to
you
do
do
it
she
mumbled
seeming
to
come
back
to
a
kind
of
reality
just
get
out
of
here
now
after
it
starts
he
gives
you
shots
and
things
but
nothing
works
ally
felt
her
consciousness
start
to
wobble
she
reached
out
and
seized
the
edge
of
the
bed
for
support
kristen
talk
to
me
her
eyes
went
blank
again
and
ally
could
just
barely
make
out
what
she
mumbled
next
in
fact
all
she
could
catch
were
random
words
words
that
only
drifted
through
her
consciousness
and
failed
to
stick
or
make
any
sense
it
was
as
though
kristen
were
in
a
stance
and
sleepwalking
among
the
words
of
some
alien
language
young
kristen
seemed
to
say
you
want
to
be
to
stay
old
is
so
horrible
time
you
young
and
then
suddenly
you
old
and
it
turns
out
you
ca
ally
heard
the
words
but
they
did
make
any
sense
i
sorry
kristen
i
feeling
a
little
dizzy
it
started
she
said
abruptly
coherent
again
and
focusing
in
on
ally
that
how
it
began
with
me
at
first
they
said
everything
was
okay
and
then
it
was
what
are
you
talking
about
it
happening
throughout
my
body
she
sobbed
i
stopped
having
periods
and
i
getting
acne
everything
is
changing
the
words
drifted
through
space
and
ally
felt
like
she
was
hallucinating
in
a
place
where
time
was
sliding
sideways
the
images
were
all
retro
things
from
her
past
that
floated
through
her
vision
in
reverse
chronological
order
that
was
it
in
her
mind
time
was
going
backwards
but
was
it
just
in
her
mind
she
looked
again
at
kristen
and
gasped
finally
finally
she
understood
the
horror
of
what
was
really
happening
oh
my
god
i
got
here
as
soon
as
i
could
after
they
called
me
came
a
voice
from
the
doorway
she
turned
and
saw
karl
van
de
vliet
together
with
the
nurse
marion
you
really
should
be
down
here
i
do
know
who
gave
you
a
card
but
we
brought
a
wheelchair
you
really
should
be
resting
marion
rolled
the
chair
through
the
door
and
expertly
plucked
the
card
from
the
reader
now
please
sit
down
she
said
we
all
just
want
to
be
on
the
safe
side
do
we
i
need
to
give
you
a
sedative
ally
looked
at
van
de
vliet
wanting
to
strangle
him
no
you
not
giving
me
a
damned
sedative
i
do
want
to
be
on
the
side
i
want
the
truth
and
i
want
it
now
chapter
april
let
go
into
the
lab
to
talk
van
de
vliet
said
i
very
sorry
i
was
here
when
you
came
out
of
sedation
but
marion
called
me
at
home
as
i
told
her
to
do
and
i
came
in
as
quickly
as
i
could
got
a
place
on
the
lake
just
down
the
road
so
i
never
far
away
he
was
rolling
her
through
the
air
lock
door
marion
behind
them
then
they
took
the
elevator
up
she
was
furious
that
kristen
was
being
left
behind
like
an
abandoned
casualty
of
war
ally
also
was
reminding
herself
about
her
appointment
with
grant
to
get
the
hell
out
but
her
mind
was
having
trouble
holding
a
lot
of
thoughts
at
once
he
pushed
her
wheelchair
into
the
section
of
the
laboratory
where
a
line
of
computer
terminals
was
stationed
after
he
fluffed
a
pillow
behind
her
head
and
turned
off
some
of
the
glaring
fluorescents
he
began
alexa
this
is
a
delicate
time
for
you
we
need
to
get
you
upstairs
as
quickly
as
possible
and
feed
you
some
broth
and
put
you
back
to
bed
however
i
want
very
much
to
give
you
an
update
on
the
status
of
your
treatment
the
headline
is
it
going
very
well
we
fused
some
of
the
telomerase
enzyme
with
your
existing
stem
cells
and
your
response
was
immediate
in
fact
it
appears
the
new
heart
tissue
has
reached
critical
mass
and
has
already
begun
replicating
itself
we
learned
to
expect
the
unexpected
around
here
but
your
response
has
significantly
exceeded
our
simulations
he
turned
to
marion
and
asked
her
to
go
up
and
make
sure
bedding
had
been
changed
we
be
up
in
a
second
and
please
make
sure
that
bowl
of
broth
is
ready
and
waiting
after
she
departed
through
the
air
lock
he
walked
over
to
a
lab
bench
and
checked
the
numbers
that
were
scrolling
on
a
crt
screen
all
right
ally
said
talk
to
me
i
just
saw
kristen
i
still
not
sure
if
i
believe
what
i
think
is
happening
but
i
want
the
real
story
and
i
want
it
now
that
part
of
what
i
need
to
discuss
with
you
he
glanced
away
for
a
long
moment
a
pained
expression
on
his
face
seeming
to
collect
his
thoughts
finally
he
turned
back
you
see
the
clinical
trials
have
demonstrated
that
we
can
use
the
telomerase
enzyme
to
a
patient
own
stem
cells
and
then
rejuvenate
their
brain
or
liver
or
even
their
heart
so
the
next
question
that
hanging
out
there
in
space
is
obvious
what
would
happen
if
we
could
find
a
way
to
generalize
the
enzyme
and
disperse
it
throughout
someone
entire
body
not
restricting
it
to
just
one
organ
and
not
just
rejuvenate
regenerate
this
question
had
actually
passed
fleetingly
through
her
consciousness
though
not
fully
articulated
it
had
taken
the
form
of
wondering
where
the
use
of
these
immortal
cells
could
eventually
lead
the
trick
would
be
to
have
just
enough
enzyme
in
your
bloodstream
to
replace
senescent
cells
as
they
are
about
to
the
but
not
so
much
that
healthy
cells
are
replaced
he
paused
searching
for
a
metaphor
if
we
thought
of
the
process
of
cell
senescence
as
something
inexorable
and
steady
like
a
treadmill
then
what
we
want
to
do
is
run
just
fast
enough
to
stay
in
one
place
this
whole
thing
does
sound
like
alice
in
wonderland
yes
well
if
we
could
do
that
then
it
possible
just
possible
that
one
entire
body
would
simply
begin
regenerating
itself
instead
of
aging
not
just
your
skin
all
of
you
that
the
theory
behind
what
we
called
the
beta
procedure
but
is
that
something
you
ethically
ought
to
be
doing
she
said
feeling
a
sense
of
dismay
of
playing
god
is
that
going
too
far
frankly
i
beginning
to
agree
with
you
but
there
are
others
who
ask
how
far
is
too
far
half
the
medicines
we
now
have
are
intended
to
trick
the
body
responses
somehow
or
to
meddle
in
some
other
way
turning
off
go
signals
at
the
cellular
level
for
example
some
birth
control
pills
make
your
body
think
you
already
pregnant
they
trick
our
natural
mechanisms
that
kind
of
thing
is
commonplace
in
medicine
today
but
our
research
is
poised
for
the
next
level
to
answer
the
question
of
how
long
we
can
actually
live
so
here
the
argument
there
no
reason
the
human
life
span
has
to
be
what
it
is
in
some
unhealthy
nations
the
average
citizen
does
even
reach
sixty
whereas
in
others
like
the
united
states
and
japan
the
mean
is
already
well
past
three
score
and
ten
so
what
is
right
what
is
reasonable
a
hundred
two
hundred
it
entirely
possible
to
believe
we
could
live
productive
lives
at
least
twice
as
long
as
we
do
now
and
you
think
we
should
do
this
the
world
would
be
thrown
into
chaos
but
look
at
the
incredible
cure
rate
we
already
effected
here
using
the
telomerase
enzyme
when
our
clinical
trials
for
the
nih
are
announced
it
will
be
the
medical
equivalent
of
the
shot
heard
round
the
world
nothing
we
know
will
ever
be
the
same
again
that
where
you
should
leave
it
to
go
further
is
obscene
i
fear
recent
events
may
have
proved
you
right
against
my
better
judgment
i
went
ahead
and
experimented
with
the
beta
procedure
and
the
results
thus
far
have
turned
out
to
be
disastrous
i
guess
you
referring
to
kristen
one
day
i
casually
mentioned
the
beta
to
winston
bartlett
and
without
telling
me
he
brought
it
up
with
kristen
she
insisted
on
trying
it
his
expression
grew
increasingly
pained
i
want
you
to
know
i
was
against
it
i
warned
her
that
it
was
highly
experimental
that
i
could
not
guarantee
what
the
side
effects
might
be
but
she
begged
me
to
do
it
anyway
then
bartlett
essentially
ordered
me
to
do
it
so
what
happened
he
grimaced
i
got
the
dosage
wrong
that
my
best
guess
after
i
performed
the
beta
on
kristen
the
enzyme
was
stable
in
her
for
over
two
months
and
appeared
to
be
having
an
effect
all
signs
of
aging
abruptly
stopped
it
gave
me
a
false
sense
of
confidence
also
there
were
no
side
effects
that
was
when
bartlett
wanted
to
try
it
too
so
i
went
ahead
with
him
but
then
to
my
horror
she
started
evincing
side
effects
i
now
believe
the
dosage
i
gave
her
was
badly
calibrated
it
was
too
high
by
how
much
i
think
i
finally
determined
and
the
enzyme
eventually
began
replicating
too
rapidly
it
got
away
from
me
he
paused
what
happened
to
kristen
we
now
call
the
syndrome
for
lack
of
a
better
name
and
it
about
to
happen
to
bartlett
but
what
does
all
this
have
to
do
with
me
why
was
i
brought
out
here
with
all
kinds
of
bribes
and
pressure
and
do
you
want
a
simple
answer
of
excruciating
honesty
it
would
be
helpful
the
simple
answer
is
winston
bartlett
has
an
extremely
rare
blood
type
it
ab
you
have
the
same
how
did
you
know
your
brother
you
see
i
need
to
try
to
develop
antibodies
to
the
telomerase
enzyme
that
wo
be
rejected
by
his
immune
system
i
think
there
an
outside
chance
that
i
could
culture
antibodies
taken
from
someone
with
the
same
blood
type
and
use
them
to
arrest
the
rampant
multiplying
of
telomerase
enzyme
about
to
begin
in
bartlett
blood
i
here
because
you
using
me
she
could
believe
her
ears
and
grant
had
set
it
up
no
wonder
he
was
finally
feeling
guilty
i
just
need
to
borrow
your
immune
system
for
a
few
days
it
very
safe
i
do
think
so
i
out
of
here
actually
the
procedure
is
already
under
way
while
debra
was
taking
your
last
blood
sample
she
also
injected
a
minuscule
amount
of
the
telomerase
enzyme
in
active
form
the
proprietary
version
used
in
the
beta
into
your
bloodstream
do
worry
it
perfectly
safe
the
dosage
was
so
minute
that
there
no
way
it
could
have
any
effect
on
you
you
have
got
to
be
kidding
my
god
she
thought
i
could
sue
the
hell
out
of
do
worry
think
of
it
like
a
smallpox
vaccination
he
paused
now
though
i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
just
learned
the
initial
dosage
probably
did
do
the
trick
the
amount
of
antibodies
created
was
unfortunately
minuscule
which
means
we
need
to
go
to
a
slightly
higher
infusion
but
again
do
worry
it
still
safe
i
ca
believe
i
hearing
this
she
said
finally
gasping
for
air
in
her
fury
you
did
ask
alexa
he
cut
in
right
now
i
have
something
like
two
weeks
left
to
try
to
head
off
the
syndrome
in
winston
bartlett
if
we
achieve
that
then
i
hopeful
the
antibodies
he
creates
can
be
successfully
used
to
start
reversing
the
syndrome
in
kristen
we
will
know
how
to
manage
the
beta
who
knows
where
that
could
lead
but
it
all
begins
with
you
you
the
clean
slate
we
need
to
start
before
we
go
one
step
further
i
want
to
know
what
exactly
happens
with
the
syndrome
i
think
i
know
but
i
like
to
hear
something
that
too
bizarre
to
believe
it
literally
defies
every
natural
law
we
ever
known
he
could
bring
himself
to
put
it
in
words
she
thought
but
she
knew
she
guessed
right
the
first
time
the
syndrome
kristen
starr
was
growing
younger
that
was
the
horrible
development
and
nobody
could
deal
with
it
and
they
could
stop
it
karl
van
de
vliet
had
created
a
monstrosity
i
am
so
out
of
here
she
said
struggling
to
rise
from
the
wheelchair
if
you
try
to
keep
me
here
that
kidnapping
we
talking
a
capital
crime
alexa
i
understand
you
upset
but
you
in
no
condition
to
be
discharged
i
very
sorry
he
pushed
a
red
button
on
a
radio
device
on
his
belt
there
was
genuine
agony
in
his
eyes
i
never
in
my
life
coerced
a
patient
in
any
way
but
you
have
to
understand
that
so
much
is
dependent
on
you
now
there
are
no
easy
choices
left
he
lost
control
of
the
situation
here
now
she
told
herself
truly
terrified
of
winston
bartlett
that
who
really
got
control
of
my
fate
moments
later
the
security
guard
from
the
lobby
accompanied
by
marion
came
through
the
door
of
the
laboratory
no
i
not
going
to
let
you
do
this
ally
declared
i
not
letting
you
do
any
more
medical
experiments
on
me
as
she
struggled
again
to
get
out
of
the
wheelchair
she
felt
a
prick
in
her
arm
and
saw
the
glint
of
a
needle
in
the
dim
light
i
sorry
alexa
it
should
all
be
over
in
just
a
couple
of
days
and
i
swear
no
harm
will
come
to
you
she
was
feeling
her
consciousness
swirl
as
marion
began
rolling
her
through
the
steel
air
lock
the
last
thing
she
heard
was
van
de
vliet
saying
do
worry
a
week
from
now
all
this
will
seem
like
a
dream
chapter
april
stone
felt
his
consciousness
returning
as
the
blast
of
an
engine
cut
through
his
reverie
where
was
he
there
were
vibrations
all
around
him
and
a
deafening
roar
that
was
slowly
spiraling
upward
in
frequency
and
volume
as
the
haze
that
engulfed
his
mind
slowly
began
to
dissipate
he
wondered
if
this
was
more
of
the
fantasy
he
been
having
of
flying
through
some
kind
of
multicolored
continuum
or
was
he
waking
up
to
something
spectacularly
real
as
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
around
he
realized
it
was
no
dream
he
was
in
a
cramped
airline
seat
strapped
in
with
a
black
seat
belt
his
head
was
gently
secured
to
a
headrest
by
a
soft
cotton
scarf
but
his
hands
were
free
lying
in
his
lap
somebody
had
lifted
him
into
the
seat
and
strapped
him
down
on
his
left
was
a
plexiglas
window
and
when
he
looked
out
he
saw
the
earth
beneath
him
begin
falling
away
my
god
then
he
realized
he
was
in
a
helicopter
that
had
just
lifted
off
from
a
rooftop
helo
pad
he
watched
spellbound
quickly
coming
awake
as
the
craft
quickly
began
a
flight
path
that
circled
around
and
past
the
lower
end
of
manhattan
then
he
heard
the
pilot
speaking
curtly
to
an
air
controller
somewhere
and
he
looked
up
and
realized
it
was
the
same
samurai
bastard
slugged
him
on
the
street
and
then
aided
in
his
kidnapping
but
that
had
to
be
yesterday
or
god
knows
how
many
days
ago
he
was
realizing
he
just
lost
a
chunk
of
his
life
and
now
he
was
being
taken
somewhere
in
a
very
big
hurry
being
up
here
always
seems
like
being
closer
to
god
came
a
voice
from
behind
him
he
recognized
it
with
a
jolt
it
was
the
man
who
thought
he
was
god
shakily
he
removed
the
scarf
that
had
been
holding
his
head
and
turned
around
winston
bartlett
was
gazing
down
through
his
own
plastic
window
seemingly
talking
to
himself
what
what
the
hell
is
going
on
he
could
barely
get
the
words
out
oh
bartlett
said
turning
to
look
at
him
good
i
particularly
wanted
you
to
see
this
it
should
help
make
my
point
stone
struggled
to
comprehend
what
was
happening
he
was
with
the
man
he
had
wanted
to
call
father
for
nearly
four
decades
whether
he
could
admit
that
to
himself
or
not
it
could
be
the
beginning
of
the
kind
of
bonding
he
had
always
hungered
for
but
he
did
want
it
like
this
they
finally
had
a
relationship
and
it
was
completely
antagonistic
he
had
just
been
drugged
and
kidnapped
by
his
own
father
this
after
being
threatened
and
fired
again
daddy
dearest
so
what
was
this
evolving
chapter
about
winston
bartlett
he
knew
could
be
ruthless
but
he
also
was
a
visionary
in
his
own
way
then
he
remembered
what
had
happened
he
been
trying
to
track
down
kristen
where
where
are
we
going
we
going
to
the
place
you
seem
to
find
so
interesting
bartlett
declared
over
the
din
of
the
engine
but
i
was
hoping
that
we
could
have
a
rational
discourse
along
the
way
what
been
happening
thus
far
does
serve
either
of
us
i
hoping
things
have
cooled
down
a
bit
and
we
can
call
a
truce
stone
was
still
trying
to
clear
his
head
get
the
cobwebs
away
it
was
difficult
he
lost
consciousness
in
a
town
house
in
the
village
on
solid
ground
and
regained
it
here
where
the
earth
itself
seemed
in
motion
and
now
bartlett
was
trying
out
another
bargaining
style
so
even
the
rules
appeared
to
be
in
flux
look
down
there
bartlett
was
projecting
through
the
din
around
them
and
pointing
toward
the
wide
expanse
of
new
york
harbor
this
mcdonnell
douglas
is
my
zendo
my
monastery
and
the
world
below
is
my
contemplative
garden
i
come
up
here
to
find
peace
this
is
an
intersection
of
the
great
forces
of
nature
one
of
a
finite
number
on
earth
where
a
mighty
river
returns
to
the
salt
sea
from
which
it
came
these
waters
have
flowed
in
the
same
cycle
for
millions
billions
of
years
mingling
evaporating
separating
again
just
as
life
on
this
planet
continually
replicates
itself
growing
and
aging
and
dying
but
not
before
producing
the
seeds
of
its
replacement
how
can
something
be
at
once
both
timeless
and
constantly
changing
i
ponder
that
a
lot
and
i
always
end
up
thinking
of
this
river
meeting
the
sea
down
there
nature
is
a
force
unto
itself
oblivious
to
good
or
evil
to
human
desires
or
human
laws
bartlett
was
doing
a
riff
on
some
obsession
of
his
own
stone
decided
or
maybe
it
was
some
of
the
zen
philosophy
that
went
along
with
acquiring
a
collection
of
samurai
swords
if
you
believed
the
published
profiles
all
the
same
looking
down
at
the
sprawling
city
and
the
harbor
full
of
ships
it
was
hard
not
to
feel
omnipotent
and
humble
at
the
same
time
the
thing
bartlett
seemed
to
be
getting
at
though
was
that
nature
could
not
be
told
what
to
do
and
he
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
declaring
himself
a
part
of
that
unbridled
natural
force
also
powerful
enough
to
do
whatever
he
pleased
now
they
were
heading
up
the
hudson
teeming
with
early
bird
tourist
cruises
and
small
sailboats
bartlett
paused
to
take
in
the
view
with
satisfaction
finally
he
continued
his
monologue
i
know
we
had
our
differences
but
i
prepared
to
try
to
get
past
that
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
something
i
always
think
of
when
i
fly
across
this
river
time
i
call
my
obsession
time
and
the
river
physicists
will
tell
you
that
time
should
be
thought
of
as
a
kind
of
fourth
dimension
things
are
always
at
a
certain
place
in
three
dimensions
but
when
you
describe
the
location
of
a
subatomic
particle
for
example
you
also
have
to
say
when
it
was
there
to
locate
it
accurately
you
need
four
dimensions
we
think
of
them
all
as
rigid
but
what
if
one
of
them
could
be
made
fluid
what
if
you
could
alter
the
character
of
time
in
spite
of
himself
stone
took
the
bait
i
do
know
what
this
has
to
do
with
anything
nobody
can
alter
the
pace
of
time
he
found
himself
recalling
a
snippet
of
verse
by
john
donne
how
feeble
is
man
power
that
if
good
fortune
fall
can
not
add
another
hour
nor
a
lost
hour
recall
strictly
speaking
that
true
bartlett
said
gravely
turning
away
again
to
stare
out
the
plexiglas
window
down
into
the
morning
space
below
them
the
hudson
was
now
a
giant
ribbon
of
blue
heading
north
into
the
mist
but
what
if
we
could
alter
the
clocks
in
our
body
to
make
them
run
slower
he
smiled
then
pointed
off
to
his
left
all
this
below
us
has
happened
in
a
couple
of
hundred
years
what
will
it
look
like
down
there
in
another
hundred
years
will
we
still
need
these
puny
machines
to
fly
or
will
there
be
teleportation
whatever
it
is
what
would
you
give
to
be
around
to
see
that
to
have
your
own
time
slow
down
while
the
world
around
you
went
on
stone
was
looking
out
into
space
wondering
not
whether
winston
bartlett
was
an
egomaniacal
madman
but
rather
how
truly
mad
he
really
was
flying
in
the
helicopter
he
felt
like
faust
being
shown
the
world
by
mephistopheles
except
here
satan
was
his
own
father
offering
him
a
teasing
prospect
of
what
it
would
be
like
to
live
on
and
on
it
would
make
a
hell
of
a
story
the
problem
was
miracles
always
came
with
some
kind
of
terrible
price
what
was
the
price
this
time
then
he
had
another
thought
was
that
what
had
happened
to
kristen
was
she
paying
the
price
for
some
kind
of
hubris
that
pushed
nature
too
far
nobody
had
claimed
she
had
any
kind
of
medical
condition
that
necessitated
a
stem
cell
intervention
so
had
she
been
experimenting
with
some
other
procedure
had
mephistopheles
now
called
in
his
marker
he
wanted
to
ask
but
the
vibration
and
the
noise
made
his
brain
feel
like
it
was
in
a
blender
do
you
understand
what
i
saying
bartlett
went
on
do
you
want
to
be
part
of
the
most
exciting
development
in
the
history
of
medicine
well
this
is
your
chance
there
is
a
majestic
experiment
under
way
but
now
we
know
it
not
for
the
fainthearted
the
question
is
do
you
want
to
live
life
or
just
write
about
it
i
think
it
time
i
heard
the
whole
story
stone
said
finally
forcing
out
the
words
what
your
part
in
this
i
put
everything
at
risk
but
now
i
this
close
to
controlling
the
clock
so
are
you
my
son
my
flesh
and
blood
do
you
have
the
balls
to
try
it
too
stone
suspected
the
question
was
rhetorical
he
was
already
up
to
his
neck
in
whatever
was
going
on
he
just
did
yet
know
how
big
a
part
of
it
he
was
while
he
been
sedated
overnight
had
they
started
experiments
on
him
he
knew
that
some
of
the
buzz
about
stem
cells
involved
the
fantasy
that
someday
they
might
be
used
to
forestall
the
aging
process
responsible
researchers
all
said
that
they
were
trying
to
extend
life
they
were
only
hoping
to
make
a
normal
lifetime
more
livable
rejuvenative
medicine
winston
bartlett
however
had
just
taken
stem
cell
potential
to
its
obvious
conclusion
he
was
talking
about
doing
what
others
did
not
dare
regenerative
medicine
what
would
we
give
to
be
able
to
look
forward
to
thousands
of
mornings
like
this
ending
it
all
only
when
we
chose
he
declared
his
hands
sweeping
over
the
dense
green
beneath
them
time
would
become
something
that
merely
flows
endlessly
through
us
ever
renewing
called
old
age
would
cease
to
exist
at
least
for
those
with
the
courage
to
take
the
necessary
risks
now
they
were
moving
above
the
pine
forests
that
comprised
the
outer
ring
of
the
greater
new
york
suburbs
as
below
them
the
green
wilds
of
new
jersey
north
of
the
gw
bridge
were
sweeping
by
hmmm
stone
pondered
if
a
man
somehow
stopped
growing
older
and
nobody
else
did
at
some
point
he
end
up
being
the
same
age
as
his
grandchildren
that
caused
him
to
think
again
about
amy
and
wonder
if
bartlett
would
ever
reconcile
himself
to
her
existence
a
few
minutes
later
he
looked
down
and
saw
a
wide
clearing
in
the
trees
and
a
roof
they
had
arrived
but
from
the
air
the
dorian
institute
gave
no
clue
to
the
momentous
research
going
on
inside
bartlett
said
nothing
as
they
began
their
descent
and
in
moments
they
were
settling
onto
the
rooftop
landing
pad
the
downdraft
from
the
rotor
cleared
away
a
few
soggy
leaves
which
had
somehow
blown
there
and
then
the
japanese
pilot
cut
the
power
and
the
sound
died
away
when
bartlett
opened
the
side
door
the
first
thing
stone
noticed
was
the
fresh
morning
air
against
his
face
he
found
himself
wondering
whether
the
roar
of
the
engine
had
disturbed
the
patients
but
that
was
almost
beside
the
point
the
dorian
institute
was
not
he
now
realized
merely
about
using
stem
cell
technology
to
heal
the
sick
bartlett
had
been
letting
him
know
that
it
was
also
about
an
experiment
that
was
much
much
more
profound
in
the
silence
that
followed
bartlett
stepped
onto
the
pad
and
lit
a
thin
filtered
cigar
for
somebody
who
just
been
talking
about
how
long
it
was
possible
to
live
the
act
confounded
credulity
he
took
a
deep
drag
then
tossed
it
onto
the
paving
and
peered
back
through
the
opening
are
you
able
to
walk
yet
i
think
i
can
manage
stone
said
he
actually
was
sure
at
all
the
vibrations
of
the
chopper
had
done
serious
damage
to
his
sense
of
equilibrium
but
he
did
find
he
could
take
small
steps
as
they
moved
to
the
stairwell
leading
down
to
the
elevator
bartlett
said
i
know
you
been
here
once
before
you
tried
to
sneak
in
grant
saw
you
and
sent
you
packing
well
this
time
you
here
for
real
the
full
experience
we
going
to
start
by
taking
you
down
to
the
lab
and
checking
you
in
the
man
stone
suspected
was
trying
to
hide
everything
that
was
going
on
in
his
mind
he
wanted
to
talk
about
grandiose
themes
but
his
mind
was
really
somewhere
else
beneath
all
the
braggadocio
there
was
the
smell
of
deep
abiding
fear
winston
bartlett
was
in
some
kind
of
major
denial
you
know
life
has
been
good
to
me
bartlett
declared
as
though
thinking
out
loud
i
done
and
seen
things
most
mortals
can
only
dream
of
i
but
i
feel
as
though
i
only
just
begun
to
live
and
that
what
i
intend
to
happen
he
turned
back
to
stone
whether
i
have
a
son
to
share
this
with
remains
to
be
seen
a
son
stone
glanced
back
at
the
man
bartlett
had
called
ken
who
was
now
shutting
down
the
mcdonnell
douglas
maybe
he
was
a
surrogate
son
for
bartlett
he
was
clearly
a
lot
more
than
a
bodyguard
he
been
the
one
who
nabbed
kristen
and
returned
her
to
the
reservation
so
what
did
he
think
of
whatever
was
going
on
or
what
about
ally
brother
grant
he
claimed
he
was
the
son
bartlett
longed
for
and
had
never
had
winston
bartlett
already
had
a
surfeit
of
sons
when
they
walked
through
the
door
and
into
the
hallway
of
the
third
floor
it
was
milling
with
the
breakfast
crowd
nurses
and
patients
but
no
one
took
any
special
notice
of
winston
bartlett
the
man
who
had
made
it
all
possible
did
they
even
know
who
he
was
stone
wondered
we
going
downstairs
bartlett
directed
him
toward
the
elevator
i
still
offering
you
a
choice
you
can
be
part
of
the
biggest
medical
advance
in
human
history
or
you
can
be
just
another
impediment
stone
glanced
at
his
watch
the
hour
was
just
shy
of
nine
where
is
ally
what
kind
of
procedure
has
she
undergone
is
she
okay
he
had
to
find
her
as
they
headed
down
he
felt
like
it
was
a
descent
into
some
pit
of
no
return
winston
bartlett
had
not
elaborated
on
what
awaited
down
there
it
was
as
though
he
could
bring
himself
to
face
whatever
it
really
was
what
was
the
scenario
at
this
point
what
he
had
to
do
was
figure
that
out
and
then
plan
a
countermove
chapter
april
there
are
sounds
of
doors
opening
and
closing
with
whispered
words
that
are
like
alien
hisses
she
senses
she
is
in
motion
on
a
bed
that
is
gliding
past
powerful
overhead
lights
she
does
know
where
she
is
but
that
does
matter
because
wherever
it
was
she
knows
it
surely
is
a
dream
all
she
remembers
is
that
karl
van
de
vliet
had
told
her
he
wants
her
to
undergo
a
second
procedure
with
the
telomerase
enzyme
which
possibly
might
create
sufficient
antibodies
to
reverse
it
all
a
jumble
now
in
her
mind
or
had
she
just
dreamed
all
that
now
her
life
seems
a
flowing
river
that
has
no
beginning
and
no
end
her
mind
is
drifting
a
cork
bobbing
helplessly
in
the
current
then
her
brother
grant
drifts
alongside
her
at
least
she
thinks
grant
she
recognizes
his
voice
ally
can
you
hear
me
he
seems
to
be
asking
is
there
anything
you
want
to
tell
me
do
you
still
want
to
go
through
with
this
it
the
kind
of
dream
where
she
can
hear
things
around
her
but
when
she
tries
to
speak
no
sounds
will
come
instead
she
talking
inside
her
head
i
afraid
i
just
afraid
i
can
still
try
to
get
you
out
but
you
have
to
help
i
waited
for
you
last
night
but
you
never
came
she
wants
to
say
yes
get
me
out
but
she
can
only
speak
in
the
dream
now
the
lighting
changes
and
she
feels
like
she
is
falling
no
she
realizes
she
just
on
an
elevator
talk
to
me
ally
whispers
the
voice
one
last
time
i
can
try
to
stop
them
but
i
have
to
know
what
you
want
then
a
door
opens
and
she
floats
through
it
and
out
then
comes
the
clanking
of
a
door
that
reminds
her
of
the
steel
air
lock
she
gone
through
last
night
looking
for
kristen
the
smells
she
in
the
laboratory
we
can
take
her
from
here
comes
a
voice
drifting
through
her
reverie
she
fantasizes
it
karl
van
de
vliet
or
maybe
he
really
is
there
in
her
dream
state
it
hard
to
know
but
he
is
alone
you
said
you
make
one
more
attempt
to
create
the
antibodies
is
it
winston
bartlett
or
at
least
it
sounds
like
him
i
said
i
would
do
all
i
could
the
first
attempt
you
know
what
happened
i
got
almost
no
results
but
i
gave
you
an
injection
of
all
i
managed
to
garner
today
i
spent
the
day
doing
simulations
working
closer
to
the
edge
than
i
thought
that
why
i
needed
her
down
at
the
lab
tonight
i
want
to
run
some
more
tests
and
then
try
to
make
a
decision
tonight
there
just
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
risk
than
i
first
thought
the
voice
trails
off
and
ally
finds
herself
trying
to
comprehend
risk
she
hears
beta
again
and
it
floats
through
her
mind
but
now
its
meaning
is
unclear
it
something
she
heard
but
can
no
longer
place
ally
comes
a
ghostly
voice
surely
this
is
a
dream
and
she
recognizes
it
as
her
father
arthur
now
she
can
see
him
he
wearing
a
white
cap
and
they
boating
in
central
park
he
shows
up
in
her
dreams
a
lot
and
she
feels
he
the
messenger
of
her
unconscious
telling
her
truths
that
she
sometimes
does
want
to
hear
ally
he
says
he
going
to
perform
the
full
beta
procedure
on
you
he
did
tell
you
but
you
know
it
true
he
thinks
he
finally
calculated
everything
right
ca
you
see
is
that
what
you
want
she
is
sure
what
she
wants
and
right
now
she
is
entirely
clear
where
she
fits
on
the
scale
of
it
is
so
bizarre
the
two
parts
of
her
mind
the
conscious
and
the
unconscious
are
talking
to
each
other
her
unconscious
is
warning
her
about
fears
she
even
know
she
had
or
at
least
she
had
admitted
to
yet
then
she
hears
winston
bartlett
voice
again
karl
we
ca
save
kristen
now
i
finally
realized
that
gone
too
far
it
just
a
tragedy
we
have
to
figure
out
how
to
live
with
the
body
is
a
complex
chemical
laboratory
that
sometimes
gets
out
of
balance
there
always
hope
i
think
know
what
i
fucking
think
bartlett
cuts
him
off
i
think
i
in
line
for
the
syndrome
if
you
do
get
this
right
what
ally
wants
to
do
more
than
anything
else
is
to
make
sense
of
what
her
options
are
the
most
obvious
one
in
fact
maybe
the
only
one
is
to
flow
along
with
that
infinite
river
she
feels
around
her
just
to
lie
where
she
is
in
this
reverie
and
let
her
body
be
taken
over
by
karl
van
de
vliet
perhaps
he
has
marvelous
things
in
store
for
her
except
she
has
no
idea
what
real
and
what
is
imaginary
the
simulations
are
giving
me
some
idea
of
what
went
wrong
with
the
beta
before
the
voice
is
van
de
vliet
i
have
one
more
test
to
run
but
if
i
handled
this
the
way
the
simulation
now
suggests
i
think
i
could
actually
generate
the
telomerase
antibodies
we
need
and
get
the
beta
to
finally
work
avoiding
the
syndrome
but
to
prove
it
would
require
a
experiment
i
reluctant
to
do
that
without
alexa
permission
christ
karl
are
you
getting
cold
feet
this
is
a
hell
of
a
time
for
that
call
it
a
pang
of
rationality
but
everything
is
at
stake
i
do
know
what
eventually
going
to
happen
with
the
syndrome
but
it
criminal
to
jeopardize
any
more
lives
van
de
vliet
sighs
look
you
had
the
procedure
of
your
own
free
will
and
you
knew
the
risks
alexa
hampton
did
volunteer
for
the
beta
she
not
a
lab
rat
at
the
very
least
we
ought
to
get
her
to
sign
a
release
the
liability
is
in
any
case
i
not
doing
anything
till
i
run
this
last
test
then
maybe
i
have
some
idea
exactly
how
much
risk
is
involved
and
then
by
god
we
going
to
do
it
tonight
this
is
it
she
feels
a
cold
metal
object
insinuate
itself
against
her
chest
time
rushes
around
her
sending
her
forward
on
a
journey
that
seems
increasingly
inevitable
where
it
taking
her
she
has
no
idea
but
she
senses
she
no
longer
has
an
option
of
whether
she
wants
to
go
or
not
now
her
dreamscape
has
become
crowded
as
grant
drifts
in
once
more
he
seems
to
be
wearing
a
white
lab
coat
like
the
others
he
settles
beside
her
and
takes
her
hand
ally
it
going
to
be
okay
i
going
to
be
here
for
you
grant
why
are
you
here
do
you
really
give
a
damn
about
me
she
wants
to
talk
to
him
but
the
words
are
working
why
is
this
happening
do
let
them
give
you
more
medications
she
tells
herself
get
your
mind
back
and
get
out
of
here
chapter
april
ellen
had
not
left
after
the
day
shift
ended
at
six
instead
she
had
told
van
de
vliet
that
she
wanted
to
reorganize
some
of
the
nih
paper
files
she
kept
in
her
office
on
the
first
floor
the
truth
was
she
had
become
convinced
that
the
culmination
of
something
deeply
evil
was
scheduled
for
later
that
night
the
evil
had
begun
when
kristen
starr
mother
arrived
looking
for
her
and
declaring
that
she
been
kidnapped
then
after
vee
categorically
denied
he
knew
anything
about
her
a
blatant
lie
kristen
was
brought
back
to
the
institute
from
wherever
she
been
moved
to
and
she
was
visibly
changed
she
was
whisked
down
to
the
subbasement
the
moment
she
arrived
and
immediately
sealed
off
in
intensive
care
but
it
was
clear
she
had
no
idea
who
she
was
or
where
she
was
something
horrible
had
happened
to
her
and
maybe
it
was
imagination
but
she
no
longer
even
looked
like
a
grown
woman
then
this
morning
bartlett
and
his
japanese
bodyguard
brought
in
the
young
man
who
had
accompanied
alexa
hampton
but
he
was
put
through
the
admissions
formalities
instead
he
was
taken
directly
downstairs
may
at
the
front
desk
said
she
thought
he
was
a
newspaper
reporter
she
met
once
when
they
were
on
a
panel
together
that
was
when
ellen
realized
he
was
stone
aimes
that
feisty
medical
columnist
for
the
new
york
sentinel
now
stone
aimes
might
be
able
to
save
alexa
hampton
van
de
vliet
and
debra
had
carried
out
a
special
cell
procedure
for
her
aortic
stenosis
the
first
that
they
had
attempted
for
that
particular
condition
the
results
as
shown
by
her
file
were
nothing
short
of
astonishing
she
begun
responding
in
a
matter
of
hours
she
should
be
in
a
room
upstairs
so
why
was
she
still
down
in
the
subbasement
now
ellen
knew
the
reason
she
had
seen
in
the
file
that
they
were
going
to
perform
the
beta
procedure
on
alexa
hampton
when
they
performed
it
on
kristen
starr
the
result
was
a
horrific
side
effect
and
now
they
were
going
to
do
it
again
tonight
the
criminality
that
started
with
kristen
starr
and
katherine
starr
was
going
to
be
compounded
she
was
about
to
become
part
of
a
criminal
conspiracy
she
had
to
put
a
stop
to
it
she
was
nervous
about
confronting
van
de
vliet
but
she
did
know
what
she
could
say
that
would
sound
like
an
indictment
still
she
was
damned
well
determined
to
do
it
if
nothing
else
it
would
provide
a
diversion
she
put
away
the
files
and
walked
out
into
the
dim
hallway
then
made
her
way
into
the
reception
area
everything
all
right
grace
she
asked
the
nurse
at
the
desk
my
you
working
late
came
the
pleasant
reply
quiet
as
a
mouse
around
here
i
guess
it
be
even
quieter
when
the
clinical
trials
are
finished
i
mean
after
the
celebrating
is
over
right
but
they
not
over
ellen
thought
and
there
may
a
celebration
i
going
down
to
sublevel
one
is
vee
down
there
now
i
think
he
in
his
office
everybody
else
went
out
for
a
bite
probably
that
diner
down
the
road
i
think
something
scheduled
for
later
on
i
do
know
everybody
looks
kind
of
worried
well
nobody
has
said
anything
to
me
they
do
need
to
she
thought
i
saw
the
file
she
swiped
her
card
through
the
security
slot
and
got
onto
the
elevator
when
she
stepped
off
the
laboratory
was
dark
and
a
light
was
showing
under
van
de
vliet
office
door
good
she
swiped
her
card
in
the
reader
next
to
the
laboratory
air
lock
and
went
in
another
swipe
and
she
was
on
the
elevator
down
to
the
subbasement
where
she
was
not
authorized
to
be
she
went
to
the
second
door
and
slipped
her
card
through
the
slot
wondering
what
she
would
see
the
room
was
dark
and
smelled
of
alcohol
and
disinfectant
she
quickly
closed
the
door
behind
her
before
turning
on
the
overhead
fluorescents
alexa
hampton
was
secured
to
the
bed
with
restraints
and
she
appeared
to
be
sedated
though
she
did
slowly
open
her
eyes
as
the
light
flickered
and
then
stabilized
there
was
a
wheelchair
in
the
corner
hampton
can
you
hear
me
she
whispered
hoping
not
to
alarm
her
do
you
remember
me
i
was
the
one
who
helped
you
when
you
were
first
admitted
she
watched
as
alexa
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
quietly
nodded
i
i
want
to
get
out
of
here
her
eyelids
fluttered
and
then
she
closed
her
eyes
again
but
i
too
weak
i
ca
move
you
strapped
down
love
let
me
help
you
she
reached
for
the
velcro
straps
and
then
paused
was
this
a
decision
she
wanted
to
make
if
i
do
this
it
the
end
of
my
career
here
have
i
lost
my
mind
what
will
i
do
after
this
but
if
i
do
try
to
stop
them
god
knows
what
we
could
all
end
up
convicted
of
criminal
conspiracy
and
in
prison
that
reporter
friend
of
yours
is
here
she
pulled
open
the
straps
then
helped
alexa
sit
up
in
the
bed
and
swing
her
legs
around
going
to
take
you
to
him
it
so
horrible
ally
went
on
she
was
settling
into
the
wheelchair
as
though
she
expected
it
then
she
looked
up
her
eyes
dazed
where
are
you
taking
me
do
you
mean
like
i
said
i
moving
you
into
your
friend
room
she
rolled
her
to
the
door
then
stopped
and
cracked
it
and
peeked
out
do
say
a
word
dear
she
whispered
as
she
began
pushing
alexa
down
the
hall
there
was
a
pale
flickering
light
under
the
door
at
the
end
debra
and
david
and
the
others
have
all
gone
out
to
the
diner
down
the
road
and
vee
is
in
his
office
probably
running
some
computer
simulations
but
we
need
to
be
quiet
the
fluorescent
lights
seemed
to
swirl
overhead
this
all
feels
so
familiar
ally
thought
this
is
where
i
saw
kristen
does
ellen
know
what
happened
to
her
you
two
have
to
decide
what
you
want
to
do
stone
you
sure
he
here
yes
she
said
and
he
in
some
kind
of
battle
of
wills
with
mr
bartlett
when
they
reached
the
door
at
the
end
she
tried
it
and
it
was
locked
she
pulled
out
her
magnetic
card
and
zipped
it
through
the
slot
as
they
went
through
ally
realized
the
room
was
lit
only
by
the
glow
of
a
laptop
computer
screen
stay
here
ellen
said
turning
to
leave
i
going
to
try
to
talk
to
dr
vee
as
the
door
closed
stone
finally
looked
up
he
was
wearing
a
sweater
and
jeans
and
had
been
typing
furiously
on
a
gerex
laptop
hey
how
you
feeling
he
paused
to
glance
down
and
save
what
been
writing
then
clicked
off
the
computer
i
have
no
idea
something
about
him
did
seem
quite
right
it
was
like
he
was
on
happy
pills
or
something
how
about
you
the
last
time
i
saw
you
i
was
passing
out
i
do
actually
remember
all
that
much
of
what
happened
after
that
i
think
i
went
back
to
the
city
but
i
feel
great
now
like
i
went
through
a
dark
tunnel
and
came
out
the
other
side
i
feel
very
different
i
do
know
what
next
but
right
now
i
just
happy
to
be
in
the
middle
of
the
biggest
story
in
the
history
of
medical
science
what
going
on
with
him
she
wondered
he
spacey
he
has
to
be
on
some
kind
of
drug
what
have
they
done
to
him
he
closed
the
laptop
then
reached
and
clicked
on
a
light
by
the
bed
come
on
want
to
see
something
incredible
it
a
marvel
of
medical
science
never
before
happened
what
come
with
me
i
guarantee
you
never
seen
anything
like
it
he
tossed
the
laptop
onto
the
bed
then
swung
his
feet
around
and
settled
them
onto
the
floor
she
noticed
that
the
room
was
a
pale
blue
with
white
linoleum
there
was
a
pair
of
white
slippers
next
to
the
bed
he
slipped
them
on
and
then
opened
the
door
and
grabbed
her
wheelchair
the
hallway
felt
colder
now
yet
it
was
also
stifling
as
though
someone
had
drawn
the
air
out
of
it
there
nothing
we
can
do
stone
said
there
was
a
hint
of
madness
in
his
voice
it
was
as
if
he
were
trying
to
convince
himself
that
he
was
still
sane
and
it
was
working
he
was
just
barely
holding
it
together
then
she
realized
he
was
about
to
go
into
intensive
care
where
kristen
had
been
so
kristen
still
here
oh
you
better
believe
it
he
said
she
is
most
definitely
still
here
when
they
got
to
the
door
he
revolved
back
ally
you
really
do
have
to
see
this
you
know
not
if
you
rather
nothing
remotely
like
this
is
going
to
happen
to
you
they
assured
me
what
the
hell
is
he
talking
about
on
the
other
hand
he
went
on
maybe
you
should
see
it
maybe
everybody
in
the
world
should
see
it
it
so
astonishing
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
rolled
her
in
then
he
reached
down
and
lifted
her
to
her
feet
standing
was
that
hard
and
somehow
he
had
known
that
the
room
seemed
to
be
captured
in
mist
though
surely
that
was
her
imagination
everything
must
be
her
imagination
kristen
was
in
the
corner
of
the
room
in
a
wheelchair
but
now
her
body
was
shriveled
no
shriveled
was
not
the
right
word
in
fact
there
might
not
be
a
word
to
describe
the
change
her
skin
was
smooth
and
flawless
she
did
look
like
this
the
last
time
ally
saw
her
and
now
she
wondered
how
long
ago
that
actually
was
how
many
hours
or
days
the
bones
were
the
same
as
always
in
her
cheeks
the
underlying
structure
was
sharp
and
severe
and
elegant
but
there
was
enough
flesh
on
them
they
were
reminiscent
of
what
happens
at
puberty
when
the
body
starts
changing
in
ways
that
are
well
coordinated
that
was
it
kristen
had
become
a
child
it
was
in
her
innocent
eyes
except
that
her
body
was
now
the
flesh
of
a
child
over
the
bone
structure
of
an
adult
it
scarcely
seemed
like
the
same
person
from
the
last
time
she
had
crossed
some
mystical
divide
she
was
holding
a
large
rag
doll
where
did
she
get
that
ally
wondered
and
humming
the
tune
of
the
ditty
that
ended
with
i
know
my
abc
tell
me
what
you
think
of
she
ca
talk
stone
was
saying
i
mean
actually
communicate
or
at
least
she
does
seem
to
want
to
i
already
tried
but
what
happened
incredible
there
never
been
anything
like
this
in
history
the
replacement
cells
are
making
her
body
newer
and
newer
so
she
getting
younger
and
younger
ally
walked
over
slowly
and
tried
to
take
her
hand
she
was
grasping
the
doll
and
she
violently
pulled
back
hey
she
said
trying
to
muster
a
air
how
it
going
do
you
remember
me
i
do
think
she
recognizes
you
stone
said
in
a
stage
whisper
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
the
biology
of
the
brain
but
i
think
some
kind
of
aggressive
replacement
of
memory
synapses
under
way
i
think
it
one
of
those
lifo
things
last
out
regressing
chronologically
but
in
reverse
maybe
she
lost
use
of
language
the
way
alzheimer
patients
do
i
do
know
ally
felt
herself
near
to
tears
van
de
vliet
was
going
to
use
antibodies
from
me
to
try
to
something
that
was
always
a
long
shot
he
said
but
now
the
preliminary
tests
he
just
done
on
you
indicate
that
the
level
of
enzyme
in
you
can
be
controlled
very
accurately
he
very
excited
she
turned
back
to
him
how
do
you
know
all
this
i
become
part
of
the
story
ally
that
not
supposed
to
happen
but
this
is
the
only
way
to
get
it
all
firsthand
i
have
to
live
it
and
guess
what
i
now
know
enough
to
write
the
book
i
been
waiting
all
my
life
to
write
i
have
the
punch
line
which
is
stem
cell
technology
goes
to
the
very
origin
of
life
and
it
may
turn
out
that
for
once
mother
nature
can
be
fooled
vee
venturing
into
areas
now
where
even
he
does
know
what
going
on
ally
happening
in
this
room
is
the
biggest
medical
story
since
nothing
begins
to
compare
stone
had
lost
it
there
was
true
madness
about
him
now
she
walked
back
over
to
kristen
and
leaned
over
and
kissed
her
kristen
stared
at
her
in
unfocused
confusion
but
then
she
smiled
i
alone
in
here
will
you
take
me
outside
i
want
to
find
my
mother
the
voice
was
that
of
a
and
it
sent
a
chill
through
alexa
the
memory
cells
in
her
brain
had
been
replaced
by
blanks
it
was
last
out
and
years
of
life
experience
were
being
replaced
with
nothingness
the
syndrome
time
had
to
move
in
one
direction
or
the
other
the
body
either
went
forward
or
in
reverse
there
was
no
equilibrium
then
she
had
a
further
thought
winston
bartlett
was
not
going
to
let
this
beta
disaster
run
to
its
natural
conclusion
a
horrifying
exposure
to
the
world
he
was
going
to
intervene
kristen
was
not
about
to
leave
this
room
in
her
current
condition
either
she
left
cured
which
seemed
wholly
implausible
at
this
point
or
she
departed
in
a
manner
that
left
no
trace
then
yet
another
thought
crossed
her
befuddled
mind
she
and
stone
knew
about
kristen
what
does
that
mean
for
us
stone
we
ca
leave
her
here
what
are
you
proposing
we
do
he
queried
take
her
to
an
er
somewhere
frankly
i
do
know
how
you
would
describe
her
problem
to
an
emergency
room
admissions
staffer
i
think
of
something
by
the
way
ally
so
you
should
know
she
wearing
diapers
this
is
the
real
deal
and
how
do
you
figure
in
all
this
i
told
you
i
going
to
be
the
james
boswell
of
stem
cell
technology
i
going
to
report
on
this
miracle
from
the
inside
but
now
ally
if
the
beta
procedure
is
going
to
succeed
you
have
to
be
the
one
to
make
it
happen
she
looked
at
him
still
stunned
by
the
wildness
in
his
eyes
and
she
had
a
feeling
like
her
heart
was
being
wrenched
out
you
working
with
them
are
you
she
was
fuming
with
anger
she
no
longer
knew
who
could
be
trusted
he
taken
leave
of
his
senses
or
had
his
senses
been
taken
from
him
which
was
it
i
thinking
about
you
and
hopefully
about
us
you
being
offered
something
you
be
a
fool
to
turn
down
that
all
i
have
to
say
he
took
her
hand
and
helped
her
back
into
the
wheelchair
then
he
whispered
let
get
out
of
here
he
quickly
opened
the
door
and
rolled
her
out
into
the
empty
hall
when
he
closed
the
door
behind
them
he
whispered
again
did
you
see
the
surveillance
camera
and
microphone
in
there
there
one
in
the
room
where
they
had
me
locked
up
they
just
put
them
in
to
watch
kristen
and
me
i
heard
bartlett
and
van
de
vliet
talking
if
any
of
this
beta
with
her
gets
out
of
this
building
bartlett
conglomerate
is
toast
he
bent
over
near
to
her
and
continued
whispering
listen
we
do
have
much
time
they
got
your
procedure
scheduled
for
later
on
tonight
i
still
somewhat
of
a
zombie
from
something
they
gave
me
but
maybe
i
can
help
get
you
out
of
here
let
me
tell
you
what
found
out
so
far
van
de
vliet
gave
you
a
version
of
the
beta
procedure
in
hopes
he
could
harvest
telomerase
antibodies
and
use
them
on
bartlett
but
there
was
only
a
trace
he
did
inject
those
into
bartlett
but
he
does
think
it
enough
to
have
any
effect
so
now
bartlett
is
demanding
he
give
you
a
massive
dose
of
telomerase
van
de
vliet
is
freaked
about
the
risks
but
bartlett
thinks
it
his
only
chance
to
head
off
having
what
happened
to
kristen
happen
to
him
too
however
what
bartlett
does
know
is
that
van
de
vliet
has
just
finished
a
new
computer
simulation
and
he
thinks
he
finally
figured
out
how
to
do
a
successful
beta
procedure
for
him
that
the
holy
grail
how
do
you
know
all
this
i
heard
him
talking
to
his
assistant
debra
i
was
supposed
to
be
sedated
the
reason
he
wants
to
perform
it
on
you
is
because
he
now
has
so
much
data
on
you
as
a
result
of
the
first
procedure
he
thinks
got
a
real
shot
at
redemption
ally
if
he
calculated
wrong
you
could
end
up
like
kristen
what
about
you
she
asked
you
should
get
out
too
i
should
but
look
i
been
trying
to
get
in
here
for
a
long
time
now
i
finally
in
you
could
say
i
under
duress
but
i
here
and
this
is
where
it
happening
if
i
get
out
alive
i
have
a
hell
of
a
story
is
he
thinking
clearly
she
wondered
he
seems
to
be
drifting
in
and
out
of
a
mental
cloud
what
is
wrong
with
him
stone
there
an
emergency
door
on
the
first
level
of
the
basement
if
we
can
get
up
there
we
might
be
able
to
escape
and
while
doing
it
you
might
want
to
seriously
reconsider
staying
in
this
place
we
both
seen
kristen
what
makes
you
think
they
planning
on
either
of
us
ever
living
to
tell
that
tale
i
having
some
trouble
thinking
just
now
he
was
helping
her
out
of
the
wheelchair
but
i
do
know
you
got
to
disappear
whatever
plans
they
have
for
me
remain
to
be
seen
but
i
know
exactly
what
in
store
for
you
so
come
on
and
try
to
walk
we
ca
use
the
elevator
but
there
a
fire
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
which
leads
up
to
the
lab
floor
it
probably
alarmed
she
thought
then
what
do
we
do
walking
was
easier
than
she
expected
the
strength
was
rapidly
coming
back
in
her
legs
but
more
than
that
there
was
no
sense
of
tightness
in
her
chest
as
she
might
have
expected
she
was
always
aware
of
traces
of
stenosis
but
now
she
felt
nothing
maybe
there
were
miracles
the
hallway
was
dimly
lit
and
she
wondered
is
a
surveillance
camera
tracking
our
every
move
shit
stone
announced
when
they
reached
the
fire
door
alarmed
that
exactly
what
i
was
afraid
of
she
thought
any
chance
they
bluffing
do
think
so
he
pointed
that
little
red
diode
says
it
hot
god
she
thought
we
got
to
get
out
of
here
maybe
we
could
just
make
a
dash
for
it
he
looked
at
her
and
shook
his
head
like
you
in
shape
to
dash
no
what
called
for
is
stealth
he
was
pulling
out
his
wallet
the
thing
about
these
card
readers
some
of
them
like
those
that
get
you
into
bank
atms
sometimes
will
open
for
other
cards
i
got
four
kinds
of
plastic
might
as
well
give
them
a
try
well
just
hurry
she
leaned
against
the
wall
i
starting
to
get
weak
he
slipped
his
visa
through
and
nothing
happened
he
immediately
tried
mastercard
again
nothing
maybe
i
should
try
my
bankcard
he
slipped
a
chase
plastic
through
but
once
more
nothing
happened
this
is
working
stone
she
sighed
feeling
her
legs
weaken
as
she
clasped
the
wall
i
think
we
going
to
have
to
chance
the
elevator
do
give
up
yet
he
took
out
his
american
express
kissed
it
and
swiped
it
through
one
last
shot
the
red
diode
blinked
off
never
leave
home
without
it
she
whispered
we
will
now
proceed
very
very
quietly
he
carefully
pushed
open
the
door
inches
at
a
time
the
stair
had
metal
steps
and
was
lit
by
a
single
fluorescent
bulb
as
he
helped
her
up
ally
was
wondering
if
there
was
any
way
to
extract
her
mother
too
she
could
imagine
how
she
could
do
it
and
besides
nina
might
well
refuse
to
go
no
just
get
out
and
make
stone
understand
that
no
way
was
winston
bartlett
going
to
let
him
go
free
to
tell
the
story
of
kristen
he
clearly
was
thinking
with
all
cylinders
stone
aimes
was
about
to
disappear
just
like
kristen
had
the
entry
to
the
laboratory
level
was
also
alarmed
but
american
express
once
again
saved
the
day
when
they
pushed
open
the
door
however
the
lights
were
on
in
the
office
at
the
far
end
of
the
hallway
where
that
door
that
grant
was
going
to
use
to
get
me
out
she
wondered
then
she
saw
a
door
marked
exit
next
to
van
de
vliet
office
shit
it
all
the
way
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
hall
stone
we
have
to
get
to
that
door
before
anybody
sees
us
i
know
if
it
alarmed
or
not
but
that
the
ball
game
she
reached
for
his
hand
if
we
can
get
there
and
get
out
please
come
with
me
we
can
make
it
to
the
highway
you
ca
stay
here
let
get
you
out
then
we
talk
i
drag
you
if
i
have
to
as
they
moved
quietly
along
the
wall
they
could
hear
an
argument
under
way
she
recognized
the
voices
as
ellen
and
karl
van
de
vliet
i
wo
allow
my
staff
to
be
part
of
this
ellen
was
declaring
seen
kristen
any
form
of
the
beta
is
dangerous
if
you
do
anything
involving
that
procedure
again
you
put
everybody
here
at
risk
do
you
think
i
thought
about
that
agonized
about
it
we
have
one
chance
to
turn
all
this
around
this
is
it
i
do
want
to
be
involved
and
i
do
want
any
of
my
people
involved
do
you
hear
me
then
keep
them
upstairs
he
was
striding
out
of
his
office
flipping
on
the
lights
in
the
hallway
oh
shit
ally
whispered
she
opened
a
door
and
pulled
stone
into
the
examining
room
where
her
mother
had
first
been
admitted
just
as
she
did
she
heard
the
ding
of
the
elevator
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
debra
and
david
van
de
vliet
senior
researchers
getting
off
when
she
closed
the
door
the
room
should
have
been
pitch
black
but
it
was
a
candle
was
burning
on
a
counter
and
there
was
a
figure
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
he
was
sitting
on
the
examining
table
in
the
lotus
position
his
eyes
closed
are
you
ready
kenji
noda
asked
i
think
just
about
everyone
is
here
now
oh
my
god
ally
thought
what
are
we
going
to
do
she
watched
helplessly
as
he
reached
over
and
touched
a
button
on
the
desk
a
red
light
popped
on
above
the
door
a
moment
later
it
opened
what
are
you
doing
here
debra
asked
staring
at
them
getting
some
exercise
stone
said
then
winston
bartlett
appeared
in
the
doorway
behind
her
how
did
they
get
up
here
ally
i
not
going
to
let
them
do
this
to
you
stone
declared
seizing
her
hand
we
going
to
ken
please
get
him
out
of
here
bartlett
said
him
back
downstairs
anywhere
you
should
be
out
of
your
wheelchair
debra
was
saying
she
turned
to
ellen
would
you
get
i
not
getting
you
anything
ellen
declared
i
just
submitted
my
resignation
effective
three
minutes
ago
i
do
know
a
thing
about
what
going
on
here
and
from
now
on
i
do
want
to
know
she
got
on
the
elevator
and
the
door
closed
ken
bartlett
said
first
things
first
go
after
that
woman
let
her
leave
the
building
now
debra
was
rolling
in
a
wheelchair
david
had
appeared
also
deep
disquiet
in
his
eyes
and
he
helped
her
in
there
very
little
risk
to
this
he
said
believe
me
she
felt
him
giving
her
an
injection
in
her
left
arm
no
do
as
the
room
started
to
spin
she
reached
out
and
grabbed
stone
arm
and
pulled
him
down
to
her
downstairs
she
whispered
look
around
there
she
did
get
to
finish
because
debra
was
whisking
her
out
the
door
and
toward
the
laboratory
stone
had
just
grinned
confusedly
seemingly
not
paying
any
attention
to
what
she
was
saying
instead
he
ambled
toward
the
open
stair
door
and
disappeared
at
this
point
however
no
one
appeared
to
notice
or
to
care
they
were
rolling
her
through
the
steel
air
lock
on
the
other
side
winston
bartlett
was
already
waiting
standing
next
to
a
gurney
with
straps
no
chapter
april
she
was
still
conscious
as
david
and
debra
lifted
her
onto
the
gurney
there
was
no
operating
table
in
the
laboratory
but
this
procedure
did
not
require
one
it
consisted
of
a
series
of
small
subcutaneous
injections
along
both
sides
of
the
spine
followed
by
a
larger
injection
at
the
base
of
the
skull
as
the
injections
began
she
drifted
into
a
where
she
was
never
entirely
sure
how
much
was
real
how
much
was
fantasy
how
much
deliberate
how
much
accidental
she
remembered
that
she
felt
her
grasp
of
reality
slipping
away
but
there
was
no
sense
of
pain
instead
images
and
sensations
in
a
sequence
that
corresponded
to
the
passage
of
time
drifted
through
her
mind
it
was
couched
in
terms
of
the
people
she
knew
the
first
image
was
her
mother
nina
and
they
were
together
struggling
through
a
dense
forest
initially
she
thought
they
were
looking
for
her
father
grave
but
then
it
became
clear
they
were
searching
for
some
kind
of
magic
potion
that
would
save
her
life
as
they
clawed
their
way
through
tangled
tendrils
and
dark
arbors
she
became
increasingly
convinced
their
quest
was
doomed
that
she
was
destined
to
watch
nina
pass
into
oblivion
but
then
something
happened
the
forest
opened
out
onto
a
vast
meadow
bathed
in
sunshine
in
the
center
was
a
cluster
of
mushrooms
and
she
knew
instinctively
that
these
would
bring
eternal
life
to
anyone
who
ate
them
come
she
said
to
nina
these
can
save
you
ally
i
too
old
now
i
do
want
to
be
saved
there
comes
a
moment
in
your
life
when
you
done
everything
you
feel
you
needed
to
do
you
had
the
good
times
and
now
all
that
left
is
the
slow
deterioration
of
what
left
of
your
body
it
robs
the
joy
out
of
living
no
mom
this
is
different
she
said
plucking
one
of
the
white
mushrooms
and
holding
it
out
this
prevents
you
from
growing
any
older
you
stay
just
the
way
you
are
you
can
have
a
miracle
never
escape
this
vale
of
tears
to
watch
everyone
you
love
grow
old
and
wither
and
die
is
that
the
you
want
me
to
have
then
she
looked
up
at
the
flawless
blue
sky
and
held
out
her
arms
as
though
to
embrace
the
sun
my
mind
ally
you
given
me
back
my
mind
now
i
can
live
out
whatever
more
life
god
will
see
fit
to
give
me
and
actually
know
who
i
am
and
where
i
am
that
miracle
enough
for
me
as
she
said
it
a
beam
of
white
light
came
directly
from
the
sun
and
enveloped
her
then
the
meadow
around
them
faded
away
and
all
she
could
see
was
karl
van
de
vliet
who
was
bending
over
her
and
lifting
back
her
eyelids
alexa
i
ca
tell
you
what
you
about
to
feel
because
no
one
has
ever
been
where
you
about
to
be
god
help
us
but
we
on
the
high
wire
without
a
net
here
but
any
new
cell
configurations
should
immediately
form
tissue
that
a
facsimile
of
what
already
there
that
what
the
simulations
show
she
was
listening
to
him
not
sure
if
he
was
real
or
a
dream
then
she
heard
bartlett
voice
why
are
you
talking
to
her
karl
she
ca
hear
you
we
do
actually
know
whether
she
can
or
not
at
some
level
i
think
she
aware
of
her
surroundings
in
a
way
we
should
hope
that
she
is
if
there
are
going
to
be
impacts
on
her
consciousness
i
rather
she
be
alert
and
able
to
remember
what
it
was
like
then
the
voices
drifted
away
but
she
was
sure
she
had
no
control
over
anything
the
white
mushrooms
she
was
thinking
about
them
again
only
now
they
were
above
her
and
growing
toward
the
sky
and
then
she
realized
she
was
underground
buried
and
looking
up
from
her
own
grave
what
happened
next
was
a
journey
through
time
somewhere
in
the
distant
future
she
seemed
to
be
watching
it
through
a
large
window
unable
to
interact
with
what
was
happening
on
the
other
side
time
she
felt
a
sensation
at
the
back
of
her
neck
and
the
images
faded
away
this
damned
well
better
be
right
came
a
voice
there
not
going
to
be
another
chance
i
did
an
activity
simulation
for
a
range
of
antibodies
just
to
make
sure
she
would
automatically
reject
the
enzyme
because
of
the
earlier
injection
the
voice
belonged
to
karl
van
de
vliet
her
mind
was
clearing
and
she
recognized
it
but
all
the
results
indicate
that
the
effect
of
the
antibodies
is
essentially
washed
out
at
this
concentration
of
active
enzyme
have
the
good
grace
to
let
me
try
to
get
this
right
she
was
listening
and
trying
to
understand
what
was
going
on
her
mind
had
been
drifting
through
time
and
space
but
now
she
was
aware
that
something
new
was
happening
the
hallucinations
the
conversations
around
her
all
were
beginning
to
focus
in
to
build
in
intensity
but
that
was
not
what
was
really
happening
it
was
merely
a
mask
over
something
that
had
entered
the
laboratory
some
kind
of
force
then
her
vision
began
to
work
in
a
strange
way
that
felt
more
like
a
sixth
sense
she
was
seeing
what
was
going
on
in
the
room
even
though
her
eyes
were
shut
or
perhaps
they
were
she
did
know
and
she
was
still
strapped
to
the
gurney
so
she
had
no
way
to
check
kristy
winston
bartlett
said
dismay
in
his
voice
you
should
be
in
here
you
should
be
resting
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
down
here
van
de
vliet
demanded
the
pitch
of
his
voice
had
noticeably
gone
up
who
ally
wondered
who
he
talking
to
there
are
definitely
new
people
in
the
room
come
on
ally
said
a
voice
in
her
ear
urgent
this
time
she
knew
who
it
was
it
was
stone
damn
them
all
i
getting
you
out
of
here
now
chapter
april
she
felt
the
straps
on
the
gurney
loosening
and
then
she
started
prying
her
eyes
open
she
thought
hoped
it
was
stone
but
she
could
see
well
enough
to
be
absolutely
sure
her
mind
and
her
vision
were
still
overflowing
with
horrifying
nightmares
of
time
gone
awry
what
did
all
those
bizarre
dreams
mean
she
was
groggy
but
was
coming
alert
perhaps
it
was
the
sense
of
electricity
in
the
room
but
something
very
unscheduled
was
going
on
when
she
finally
got
her
eyes
open
and
focused
what
greeted
her
was
a
blinding
row
of
white
lights
directly
overhead
that
seemed
to
isolate
her
but
there
was
tumult
all
around
her
in
the
lab
a
cacophony
of
alarmed
voices
echoing
off
the
hard
surfaces
of
glass
and
steel
she
squinted
into
the
light
as
she
felt
stone
slip
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
and
raise
her
up
thank
god
he
here
she
thought
come
on
he
was
saying
she
not
interested
in
you
she
just
wants
kristen
out
of
here
this
is
the
only
way
who
she
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
mildly
surprised
to
discover
she
was
even
capable
of
speech
she
gazed
around
trying
to
find
her
when
jesus
katherine
starr
was
standing
next
to
kristen
she
was
moving
in
a
surreal
way
gripping
kristen
hand
and
pulling
her
along
stone
had
found
her
he
had
understood
katherine
starr
appeared
to
be
wearing
a
blue
bathrobe
under
a
gray
mackintosh
but
the
part
that
got
ally
attention
was
the
knife
she
was
holding
glistening
like
a
scalpel
no
it
scalpel
shiny
and
sharp
as
a
razor
tough
luck
guys
no
pistol
this
time
but
she
still
managed
to
come
up
with
a
convincing
substitute
she
did
look
any
saner
than
she
did
the
last
time
now
though
she
finally
had
what
she
come
for
she
had
her
daughter
could
it
be
that
kristen
was
about
to
be
liberated
had
the
world
come
full
circle
no
the
voice
belonged
to
winston
bartlett
i
want
her
with
me
you
the
prick
responsible
for
this
katherine
whirled
on
him
brandishing
the
scalpel
starr
van
de
vliet
interjected
eyeing
the
sharp
metal
you
ca
take
kristen
away
now
she
at
a
very
delicate
stage
of
her
procedure
i
seem
to
be
doing
a
lot
of
things
i
ca
she
declared
turning
back
i
not
supposed
to
be
out
of
my
room
but
i
am
and
now
getting
us
both
out
of
here
we
going
through
that
air
lock
and
onto
the
elevator
so
whose
throat
do
i
need
to
cut
to
do
it
winston
bartlett
was
edging
away
and
his
eyes
betrayed
he
was
more
concerned
than
he
wished
to
appear
look
at
her
katherine
starr
continued
shoving
kristen
who
was
completely
disoriented
her
eyes
blinking
in
confusion
in
front
of
van
de
vliet
she
does
know
me
she
does
know
anything
she
acting
like
a
baby
what
in
hell
have
you
done
to
her
she
had
the
procedure
she
wanted
at
the
time
i
warned
there
might
be
side
effects
we
could
anticipate
she
lost
her
mind
that
what
you
call
a
all
this
time
kristen
was
just
standing
and
staring
blankly
into
space
but
there
were
growing
storm
clouds
welling
in
her
eyes
it
caused
ally
to
wonder
what
was
really
going
on
with
her
had
this
troubled
girl
been
made
permanently
childlike
or
was
there
a
split
personality
at
work
did
she
have
a
new
mind
now
or
a
parallel
mind
we
still
trying
to
stabilize
her
condition
van
de
vliet
said
in
a
soothing
tone
we
just
need
a
little
more
time
that
was
when
kristen
wrenched
free
of
her
mother
grasp
her
eyes
had
just
gone
critical
traveling
into
pure
madness
she
strode
over
and
seized
a
glass
jar
containing
a
clear
solvent
i
want
them
all
to
die
she
said
in
a
little
girl
voice
going
to
kill
me
if
i
do
kill
them
first
now
katherine
starr
had
turned
and
was
staring
at
her
kristy
honey
put
the
bottle
down
i
going
to
take
you
home
i
do
know
what
done
to
you
but
i
not
going
to
let
you
stay
here
anymore
coming
with
me
this
is
not
going
to
end
well
ally
thought
she
began
struggling
to
her
feet
trying
to
clear
her
mind
enough
for
an
exit
strategy
nina
was
upstairs
or
at
least
that
was
where
she
had
been
okay
the
first
order
of
business
is
to
get
her
out
stone
could
probably
manage
on
his
own
now
kristen
was
walking
over
to
an
electric
heater
positioned
on
a
lab
workbench
she
switched
it
on
and
the
tungsten
elements
immediately
began
to
glow
then
still
holding
the
bottle
she
turned
back
to
van
de
vliet
i
see
things
that
i
never
saw
before
my
mind
has
powers
it
never
had
till
now
he
nodded
knowingly
i
always
suspected
that
i
able
to
think
just
like
i
did
when
i
was
little
she
continued
cutting
him
off
sometimes
i
there
in
that
world
then
sometimes
i
flip
back
but
i
can
always
tell
when
are
lying
to
me
what
did
you
do
to
my
mind
kristen
van
de
vliet
said
the
brain
has
many
functions
that
we
still
only
barely
understand
with
the
beta
procedure
we
do
really
know
what
activates
general
cell
replacement
or
what
the
nature
of
the
replacement
tissue
actually
is
we
just
at
the
beginning
of
a
marvelous
i
seeing
a
future
in
which
nothing
exists
she
muttered
despairingly
still
holding
the
glass
bottle
of
solvent
i
do
want
to
be
a
part
of
it
van
de
vliet
was
staring
at
her
his
eyes
flooded
with
alarm
what
what
are
you
seeing
kristen
i
seeing
you
dead
she
glared
around
all
of
you
then
with
an
animal
scream
she
whirled
and
flung
the
glass
liter
bottle
at
the
electric
heater
on
the
laboratory
workbench
it
crashed
into
the
shiny
steel
case
with
a
splintering
sound
followed
by
an
explosion
that
sent
a
ball
of
fire
and
a
shock
wave
through
the
room
in
an
instant
the
entire
end
of
the
lab
was
engulfed
in
a
sea
of
flame
ally
sensed
herself
being
knocked
to
the
floor
but
she
also
felt
a
surge
of
adrenaline
this
was
endgame
the
moment
when
everybody
found
out
who
they
were
a
hand
was
gripping
her
like
a
vise
it
was
stone
but
the
blast
had
knocked
him
to
the
floor
too
and
he
was
now
motionless
slumped
against
the
side
of
a
laboratory
bench
it
was
like
she
was
being
held
in
a
death
grip
was
she
going
to
have
to
carry
him
out
she
was
even
sure
she
had
the
strength
in
her
legs
to
get
herself
out
now
something
even
more
horrible
was
slowly
beginning
to
happen
the
central
part
of
the
lab
had
several
sets
of
steel
shelving
arranged
in
rows
and
each
supported
a
carefully
organized
arrangement
of
sample
vials
filled
with
some
kind
of
organic
solvent
she
saw
with
horror
that
the
first
towering
set
of
shelves
easily
seven
feet
high
was
slowly
tipping
from
the
force
of
the
blast
it
teetered
for
an
instant
and
then
fell
into
the
set
of
shelves
next
to
it
with
all
the
ponderous
majesty
of
a
giant
sequoia
what
happened
next
sounded
like
the
end
of
the
world
as
the
first
set
of
shelves
crashed
against
the
second
like
a
row
of
massive
glass
dominoes
each
subsequent
tower
tipped
and
fell
against
the
next
and
on
and
on
all
the
while
as
the
tumbling
racks
were
spewing
flammable
solvents
across
the
smoky
lab
space
they
were
ripping
out
electrical
wiring
and
sending
sparks
flying
the
whole
of
the
room
had
been
turned
upside
down
katherine
starr
and
debra
and
david
now
lay
pinned
beneath
a
tangled
mass
of
supports
that
had
collapsed
in
the
wake
of
the
falling
shelves
all
three
appeared
to
be
unconscious
winston
bartlett
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
he
been
slammed
against
the
wall
by
the
force
of
the
explosion
but
was
pulling
himself
up
he
seemed
to
be
unhurt
though
it
was
hard
to
see
through
the
billowing
smoke
karl
van
de
vliet
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
laboratory
his
eyes
glazed
flames
and
smoke
swirling
about
him
what
does
this
mean
to
him
ally
wondered
years
of
research
data
being
obliterated
in
an
instant
but
the
horror
was
over
the
fire
was
depleting
the
hermetically
sealed
room
oxygen
ally
sensed
that
anybody
who
did
get
out
of
the
lab
in
the
next
five
minutes
was
going
to
be
going
anywhere
standing
up
but
what
was
happening
with
kristen
she
was
walking
through
the
flames
as
though
on
a
country
stroll
it
was
like
the
fires
of
hell
were
all
around
her
and
she
was
ambling
through
them
unscathed
she
must
be
experiencing
burns
ally
thought
yet
there
a
sense
that
nothing
can
harm
her
how
could
it
be
and
then
an
astonishing
possibility
began
to
dawn
on
her
with
the
stem
cell
enzymes
working
at
full
blast
was
it
possible
her
body
was
immediately
replacing
its
damaged
cells
could
it
be
that
the
telomerase
enzyme
did
know
the
difference
between
a
cell
that
had
aged
and
one
that
had
been
damaged
by
its
environment
jesus
stone
said
finally
stirring
what
at
that
moment
the
overhead
lights
flickered
and
died
and
the
emergency
lights
clicked
on
sending
beams
through
the
smoke
christ
ally
he
declared
gazing
around
still
dazed
as
his
consciousness
seemed
to
be
slowly
returning
we
got
to
get
people
out
of
here
there
did
appear
to
be
a
sprinkler
system
probably
she
thought
because
an
onslaught
of
water
would
wipe
out
all
the
computers
now
she
was
thinking
about
the
automatic
air
locks
how
did
those
doors
work
without
electricity
did
they
have
a
battery
backup
or
some
kind
of
mechanism
which
provided
a
manual
override
in
case
of
a
power
outage
now
winston
bartlett
was
striding
toward
the
center
of
the
room
from
the
dazed
look
in
his
eyes
it
was
clear
whether
he
knew
where
he
was
or
not
kristen
was
walking
toward
him
on
a
collision
course
you
let
this
happen
she
said
you
wanted
to
ruin
my
life
kristy
nobody
made
you
do
anything
he
said
choking
from
the
smoke
but
now
we
got
to
it
too
late
she
declared
lashing
out
with
the
side
of
her
hand
against
his
neck
he
staggered
back
flailing
and
seized
an
iron
girder
there
was
a
blast
of
voltage
a
shower
of
sparks
and
he
screamed
as
he
crumpled
sideways
then
the
force
of
his
fall
broke
his
hand
loose
from
the
electrical
short
he
lay
prostrate
on
the
smoky
floor
of
the
lab
twitching
my
god
ally
thought
she
really
is
determined
to
kill
us
all
before
she
through
kristen
van
de
vliet
was
saying
please
there
still
time
going
to
do
everything
i
can
for
you
he
was
gasping
for
air
and
now
more
vials
of
flammable
liquid
were
exploding
from
the
heat
and
igniting
he
turned
and
stumbled
toward
the
air
lock
there
were
sounds
of
yelling
on
the
other
side
the
people
outside
ca
get
through
ally
realized
the
security
lock
has
no
override
we
going
to
die
van
de
vliet
pounded
on
the
button
controls
of
the
air
lock
but
there
was
no
response
smoke
was
billowing
around
him
and
he
choked
coughing
and
dropping
to
one
knee
then
kristen
walked
up
behind
him
she
appeared
not
to
notice
the
flames
and
smoke
swirling
around
her
this
is
where
you
get
what
coming
you
bastard
i
warned
you
better
do
something
for
me
but
you
never
really
intended
to
help
me
i
was
just
an
experiment
that
all
i
ever
was
for
both
of
you
you
fuckers
and
she
lashed
out
with
a
powerful
fist
sending
him
to
the
floor
outside
there
was
now
the
wail
of
a
siren
the
sound
faintly
filtering
through
and
the
pounding
on
the
other
side
of
the
air
lock
continued
though
now
it
had
the
force
of
authority
at
last
ally
thought
somebody
finally
got
serious
and
called
the
fire
department
now
kristen
had
bent
over
the
prostrate
van
de
vliet
and
was
doing
something
though
ally
could
tell
what
keep
your
face
close
to
the
floor
stone
was
yelling
it
where
the
last
of
the
air
is
hang
on
we
be
okay
she
had
a
premonition
they
were
not
going
to
be
okay
they
all
were
going
to
suffocate
all
that
was
except
kristen
she
seemed
to
possess
some
magic
immunity
from
the
horrors
around
her
she
had
risen
and
was
standing
over
van
de
vliet
like
a
statue
while
everybody
else
was
on
the
floor
as
ally
watched
her
a
serene
figure
in
the
middle
of
chaos
and
death
she
began
to
have
an
odd
sensation
the
burning
in
her
lungs
from
the
smoke
started
to
dissipate
and
strength
felt
like
it
was
pouring
into
her
limbs
the
tongues
of
flame
around
her
had
become
dancing
white
figures
that
invited
her
to
rise
and
join
them
she
did
slowly
not
quite
knowing
what
she
was
doing
then
she
walked
to
the
jammed
air
lock
she
stepped
over
karl
van
de
vliet
collapsed
frame
and
placed
her
hands
on
the
steel
it
was
already
scalding
but
she
only
took
fleeting
notice
of
that
while
a
firefighter
ax
futilely
pounded
on
the
outside
she
seized
the
wide
bar
of
the
door
and
ripped
it
open
to
the
sound
of
wrenching
metal
it
was
a
superhuman
effort
she
did
realize
she
was
capable
of
and
it
was
the
last
thing
she
remembered
the
space
around
her
had
become
a
blazing
white
cloud
and
she
did
feel
the
hands
of
the
two
firefighters
who
seized
her
as
she
fell
through
the
open
air
lock
chapter
june
days
later
alexa
hampton
was
still
considering
herself
one
of
the
luckiest
people
alive
when
she
regained
consciousness
the
next
week
in
lenox
hill
hospital
hooked
up
to
oxygen
and
being
fed
by
an
iv
she
noticed
that
the
nurses
were
looking
at
her
strangely
and
whispering
to
each
other
finally
she
could
stand
it
anymore
and
asked
why
it
was
what
you
did
a
young
puerto
rican
woman
declared
gazing
at
her
in
awe
through
her
rimless
glasses
no
one
can
believe
it
then
she
explained
what
they
could
believe
as
reported
by
the
new
jersey
firefighters
was
that
she
had
wrenched
open
the
air
lock
of
the
laboratory
at
the
dorian
institute
at
the
time
firefighters
were
on
the
other
side
vainly
trying
to
dismantle
the
door
with
their
axes
yet
she
just
yanked
it
aside
like
paper
it
was
reminiscent
of
those
urban
legends
of
superhuman
strength
in
times
of
crisis
like
the
story
of
a
panicked
woman
who
hoisted
an
overturned
chevy
van
to
free
a
pinned
child
later
though
some
of
the
new
jersey
fire
crew
went
back
and
looked
again
the
steel
hinges
had
literally
been
sheared
off
how
did
she
do
that
more
important
though
symptoms
of
her
stenosis
had
entirely
disappeared
and
she
felt
better
than
ever
in
her
life
the
stem
cell
technology
pioneered
by
karl
van
de
vliet
had
indeed
produced
a
miracle
she
even
had
a
new
kind
of
energy
periodically
it
was
unlike
anything
she
ever
felt
other
things
were
new
as
well
she
been
seeing
a
lot
of
stone
aimes
and
helping
him
finish
his
book
on
the
gerex
corporation
successful
clinical
trials
with
stem
cell
technology
after
all
the
publicity
following
the
fire
at
the
dorian
institute
the
manuscript
was
generating
a
lot
of
buzz
a
paperback
auction
was
already
in
the
works
with
a
floor
and
time
had
abruptly
taken
a
second
look
at
the
first
serial
excerpt
his
agent
had
been
trying
to
place
with
them
and
come
up
with
six
figures
the
only
part
stone
had
reported
was
the
ghastly
side
effect
of
the
early
beta
experiment
the
syndrome
because
kristen
starr
had
disappeared
he
had
no
proof
and
his
publisher
refused
to
print
potentially
libelous
speculation
in
the
meantime
winston
bartlett
had
been
seen
in
public
since
that
tragic
day
the
business
press
speculated
he
had
become
a
howard
recluse
in
his
gramercy
park
mansion
ally
had
tried
several
times
to
reach
him
through
his
office
to
find
out
what
he
wanted
to
do
about
the
design
job
and
each
time
she
was
told
he
would
get
back
to
her
he
never
did
maybe
he
was
still
recuperating
when
the
firefighters
pulled
him
out
of
the
flaming
wreckage
his
clothes
were
singed
from
the
electricity
that
had
coursed
through
his
body
his
heart
was
stopped
and
he
appeared
to
be
dead
in
fact
he
was
dead
the
paramedics
immediately
began
intensive
cpr
moments
later
his
heart
was
beating
again
then
he
declared
he
was
well
enough
that
he
did
need
to
go
to
a
hospital
he
had
his
japanese
henchman
kenji
noda
help
him
to
his
mcdonnell
douglas
and
he
disappeared
into
the
night
oxygen
had
not
been
to
his
brain
for
no
one
knew
how
long
the
paramedics
said
he
awoke
in
what
seemed
another
reality
was
he
still
alive
there
had
been
no
reports
otherwise
but
he
most
certainly
had
withdrawn
from
the
world
karl
van
de
vliet
for
his
part
had
been
hospitalized
for
severe
burns
he
remained
in
the
trauma
unit
at
vincent
hospital
but
when
alexa
tried
to
go
visit
him
she
was
told
he
was
accepting
visitors
but
was
doing
well
katherine
starr
was
dead
from
a
massive
concussion
along
with
the
two
researchers
debra
connolly
and
david
hopkins
who
had
been
in
the
wrong
place
when
the
steel
racks
collapsed
and
alexa
never
been
able
to
find
out
what
happened
to
kristen
starr
officially
nobody
by
that
name
was
there
but
business
was
business
with
the
clinical
trials
over
the
pending
sale
of
the
gerex
corporation
to
cambridge
pharmaceuticals
was
proceeding
on
autopilot
handled
by
grant
hampton
who
stood
to
make
a
bundle
or
so
he
bragged
to
alexa
the
dorian
institute
had
been
closed
and
all
the
remaining
records
moved
to
a
converted
facility
near
liverpool
after
six
days
in
lenox
hill
ally
went
home
and
three
days
after
that
she
had
returned
to
her
desk
at
citispace
now
inevitably
she
was
back
to
her
workaholic
habits
and
grueling
hours
today
though
she
had
knocked
off
early
since
nina
had
taken
a
cab
down
to
join
her
for
supper
she
marveled
just
thinking
about
it
her
mom
taking
a
cab
by
herself
it
truly
was
a
miracle
their
light
repast
had
consisted
of
cold
roast
beef
and
temperature
stout
two
of
nina
favorites
she
had
never
been
much
for
cucumber
sandwiches
with
the
crust
cut
off
afterward
she
elected
to
have
a
brandy
the
trouble
with
having
your
mind
back
she
said
as
she
settled
onto
the
couch
snifter
in
hand
is
that
sometimes
you
remember
things
you
just
as
soon
forget
outside
thunder
boomed
from
an
early
evening
rainstorm
which
had
blown
in
from
the
northwest
well
mom
at
least
now
you
can
pick
and
choose
what
you
want
to
remember
and
what
you
want
to
forget
she
did
really
mind
the
storm
having
her
mother
back
was
such
a
blessing
it
still
felt
odd
though
having
her
rescued
from
what
had
to
be
an
inevitable
ignominious
fate
it
was
as
though
time
had
gone
in
reverse
a
miracle
was
very
much
in
progress
she
was
experiencing
a
miracle
too
though
of
a
slightly
different
sort
she
felt
pretty
much
normal
if
occasionally
shaky
and
uncertain
on
her
feet
but
at
unexpected
times
she
would
have
bursts
of
energy
that
defied
reality
they
were
in
fact
scary
like
that
thing
with
the
steel
door
something
weird
would
sometimes
take
control
of
her
body
and
she
did
really
know
what
it
was
truthfully
she
was
feeling
some
of
that
tonight
she
had
joined
her
mother
with
a
brandy
and
was
thinking
about
taking
knickers
for
an
early
walk
downpour
or
not
she
wanted
to
see
the
river
through
the
mists
of
a
storm
that
was
when
the
phone
rang
she
got
up
and
made
her
way
to
the
kitchen
and
took
the
receiver
off
the
wall
hello
she
was
hoping
it
was
stone
he
usually
call
early
in
the
evening
to
see
what
she
was
doing
and
ask
if
she
wanted
some
company
alexa
i
need
to
see
you
came
a
voice
the
other
end
of
the
line
was
noisy
as
though
a
loud
motor
was
running
who
i
think
you
know
who
this
is
if
you
would
come
down
to
the
river
right
now
i
will
make
it
very
much
worth
your
while
for
some
reason
maybe
it
was
telepathy
knickers
had
begun
bouncing
about
the
kitchen
angling
for
a
walk
even
though
she
normally
was
mortally
fearful
of
thunder
now
ally
did
know
who
it
was
what
was
he
doing
calling
her
here
at
home
in
a
rainstorm
after
all
these
weeks
well
she
thought
i
have
nothing
left
to
fear
from
him
or
any
of
them
why
not
it
raining
she
said
this
had
better
be
fast
and
she
hung
up
the
phone
who
was
that
honey
nina
asked
i
hope
it
was
anybody
i
know
you
were
somewhat
abrupt
mom
they
deserved
whatever
they
got
and
it
no
big
deal
but
i
think
i
going
to
take
knickers
out
she
making
me
nuts
ally
could
focus
on
what
had
just
happened
he
had
a
lot
of
nerve
on
the
other
hand
she
loved
to
be
down
by
the
river
when
it
was
this
way
shrouded
in
pastel
mist
honey
it
raining
cats
and
dogs
nina
declared
you
apt
to
catch
your
death
no
mom
it
letting
up
now
i
be
all
right
really
she
was
digging
out
her
tan
raincoat
and
rubber
galoshes
from
the
closet
by
the
door
knickers
immediately
realized
what
was
up
and
began
a
dance
of
joy
barking
as
she
raced
to
find
her
leash
come
on
honey
ally
said
taking
the
braided
leather
i
want
you
close
to
me
the
ride
down
in
the
elevator
felt
ominous
though
knickers
failed
to
share
any
of
her
apprehension
as
she
bounced
around
the
glass
dome
and
nuzzled
ally
legs
the
thunder
she
was
sometimes
fearful
of
had
lessened
and
that
ally
thought
had
doubtless
improved
her
courage
the
condominium
no
longer
had
a
doorman
in
hopes
of
trimming
costs
the
condo
board
had
sent
out
a
secret
ballot
on
the
subject
by
a
narrow
margin
the
owners
had
voted
to
dispense
with
that
particular
frill
although
she
missed
alan
and
his
early
morning
optimism
about
his
hopes
she
realized
the
economy
was
probably
timely
all
those
weeks
when
she
had
been
pulling
her
weight
at
citispace
the
nut
on
that
operation
had
diminished
any
as
she
stepped
onto
barrow
street
the
air
was
unseasonably
brisk
and
the
rain
had
blanked
visibility
down
to
almost
nothing
on
other
days
this
would
had
been
that
magical
moment
just
after
the
sun
went
down
when
gorgeous
fiery
orange
clouds
hung
over
the
hudson
but
now
there
was
a
hint
of
brooding
in
the
bleak
rain
it
fit
the
dark
mood
she
felt
growing
around
her
he
wanted
to
meet
her
down
by
the
river
gripping
knickers
leash
she
checked
the
traffic
lights
then
marched
across
the
west
side
highway
the
new
esplanade
along
the
river
was
awash
in
the
rain
and
was
uncharacteristically
empty
that
was
lucky
for
knickers
time
ally
drew
her
close
and
clicked
open
the
catch
that
attached
it
to
her
collar
with
a
woof
of
joy
she
dashed
off
toward
the
vacant
pier
then
headed
out
baby
slow
down
ally
yelled
but
it
was
to
no
avail
a
second
later
her
fluffy
sheepdog
was
lost
in
the
rain
but
she
could
go
far
the
refurbished
pier
extended
out
into
the
river
for
maybe
the
length
of
a
football
field
and
change
beyond
that
there
was
at
least
half
a
mile
of
river
before
the
shores
of
new
jersey
for
all
her
enthusiasm
knickers
was
about
to
dive
into
the
chilly
hudson
and
swim
for
the
horizon
so
where
was
he
he
said
down
by
the
river
what
to
do
now
she
decided
she
might
as
well
walk
out
after
knickers
now
she
was
noticing
something
odd
the
air
was
chilly
actually
raw
was
a
better
description
a
last
blast
of
unusual
arctic
air
had
accompanied
the
rain
she
could
feel
the
temperature
on
her
face
she
had
stupidly
gone
out
with
just
a
light
shirt
under
the
raincoat
yet
she
did
feel
the
slightest
bit
cold
it
was
as
though
her
metabolism
had
sped
up
the
way
it
did
during
a
run
though
she
was
breathing
heavy
or
anything
it
felt
like
one
of
those
strange
moments
she
been
having
when
she
felt
superalive
now
knickers
was
returning
but
she
was
slinking
back
as
though
fearful
of
something
the
rain
running
off
her
face
come
here
baby
ally
said
reaching
out
what
is
it
the
darkness
of
the
river
flowed
over
her
now
and
for
the
first
time
ever
she
wished
she
brought
along
a
flashlight
that
was
when
out
of
the
rain
she
finally
heard
the
sound
it
was
an
engine
lowering
from
the
sky
which
knickers
must
have
already
heard
then
a
helicopter
a
mcdonnell
douglas
materialized
lowering
onto
the
empty
sports
space
on
the
pier
the
downdraft
of
the
rotor
threw
spray
against
the
fieldturf
and
into
her
eyes
but
she
gazed
through
it
unblinking
feeling
an
unexpected
sense
of
power
entering
her
limbs
the
rain
should
have
felt
cold
but
she
did
really
notice
maybe
she
thought
they
had
to
meet
they
were
bonded
as
the
pilot
cut
the
power
the
engine
began
to
wind
down
whoom
whoom
whoom
until
it
came
to
a
dead
stop
and
there
followed
an
unnatural
silence
finally
the
door
on
the
side
opened
and
a
metal
step
dropped
down
after
a
moment
pause
that
seemed
to
last
forever
he
appeared
at
first
a
vague
figure
in
the
rain
but
then
he
stepped
down
and
came
toward
her
he
was
wearing
a
white
hat
with
a
wide
brim
and
a
tan
raincoat
that
seemed
more
like
a
cloak
than
a
coat
alexa
i
so
appreciate
your
making
time
for
me
it
was
hard
to
tell
in
the
rain
but
he
appeared
to
be
strong
and
there
was
actually
a
kind
of
radiance
about
him
as
though
he
carried
his
own
special
luminosity
he
seemed
completely
transformed
the
question
was
transformed
how
he
looked
years
younger
than
the
last
time
she
saw
him
i
thought
we
should
talk
i
been
meaning
to
call
you
i
wanted
to
see
how
you
doing
that
not
it
at
all
she
told
herself
what
do
you
really
want
actually
i
been
wanting
to
thank
you
winston
bartlett
went
on
it
turns
out
that
you
saved
me
after
all
your
telomerase
antibodies
finally
kicked
in
the
initial
ones
karl
injected
in
me
it
just
took
a
few
weeks
and
what
about
kristen
she
asked
his
look
saddened
you
did
hear
he
shook
his
head
she
died
in
the
fire
that
does
sound
right
ally
thought
she
looked
like
she
was
the
only
one
who
was
going
to
survive
it
oh
yeah
how
did
that
happen
you
might
as
well
know
she
was
burned
beyond
recognition
the
body
still
has
been
officially
identified
when
the
firemen
found
her
she
had
a
shard
of
glass
through
her
throat
they
thought
she
must
have
fallen
on
something
but
i
fear
it
entirely
possible
she
could
have
done
it
to
herself
was
that
story
true
or
a
lie
ally
wondered
were
they
still
hiding
her
someplace
but
why
was
he
here
he
certainly
had
come
to
discuss
the
kitchen
design
job
for
his
gramercy
park
mansion
that
was
now
long
ago
and
far
away
alexa
he
said
moving
toward
her
please
do
be
frightened
but
there
something
i
have
to
find
out
he
reached
out
with
his
left
hand
and
seized
her
wrist
she
only
saw
the
glint
of
the
penknife
in
his
right
hand
for
an
instant
before
he
slashed
it
across
her
palm
what
she
screamed
and
yanked
her
hand
away
knickers
gave
a
loud
yelp
and
then
howled
mournfully
only
then
did
she
notice
that
there
been
just
a
momentary
flash
of
pain
it
okay
bartlett
said
reaching
to
soothe
knickers
just
a
superficial
scratch
now
watch
it
i
want
to
know
if
karl
had
time
to
finish
the
procedure
my
god
she
did
have
to
watch
she
could
already
feel
it
beginning
to
heal
what
what
going
on
is
this
he
had
hopefully
completed
the
beta
on
you
just
before
kristy
mother
showed
up
but
did
it
work
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
we
did
know
until
now
my
god
i
knew
i
was
feeling
you
received
just
the
right
amount
of
telomerase
injections
bartlett
interjected
to
induce
the
beta
without
any
side
effects
it
was
the
dosage
karl
had
been
trying
to
calculate
just
enough
that
only
aged
or
damaged
cells
are
replaced
while
healthy
tissue
is
not
altered
she
now
realized
that
was
why
she
been
having
bouts
of
incredible
energy
we
the
only
ones
he
went
on
just
us
you
and
me
we
been
given
this
gift
alexa
and
now
we
have
the
responsibility
that
goes
along
with
it
he
glanced
down
at
her
hand
by
the
way
how
that
cut
doing
what
are
you
getting
at
it
was
definitely
healing
a
wave
of
thunder
boomed
over
the
river
sending
knickers
scurrying
to
ally
side
what
i
getting
at
is
that
you
and
i
are
now
two
very
special
people
we
both
are
living
proof
of
what
the
beta
can
achieve
the
question
is
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
she
was
still
stunned
this
is
a
lot
to
absorb
i
have
to
think
i
already
thought
about
this
and
i
believe
it
must
be
kept
secret
at
all
cost
at
least
for
now
but
why
it
a
miracle
that
that
must
be
handled
prudently
i
need
your
cooperation
with
that
she
was
having
extreme
difficulty
getting
her
mind
around
what
he
was
talking
about
i
do
really
know
what
going
on
i
think
i
better
see
some
doctors
and
stone
is
finishing
his
book
about
i
got
to
tell
him
those
things
can
not
happen
alexa
he
looked
out
at
the
river
for
a
moment
then
turned
back
a
world
has
dawned
finally
all
things
are
possible
he
moved
closer
to
her
then
reached
out
and
took
her
wrist
again
she
looked
down
and
realized
the
cut
on
her
hand
was
all
but
healed
for
now
this
has
to
be
our
secret
yours
and
mine
just
us
she
thought
about
all
that
had
happened
in
the
weeks
since
her
wayward
brother
had
accosted
her
running
along
this
very
river
it
felt
like
an
eternity
i
asking
you
not
to
talk
about
this
he
continued
to
anyone
you
must
give
me
your
solemn
word
she
felt
the
grip
on
her
wrist
get
stronger
now
that
we
know
the
beta
can
work
he
went
on
his
voice
piercing
through
the
rain
i
am
forming
an
elite
association
the
methuselah
society
membership
buys
a
guarantee
that
you
can
stop
aging
in
fact
you
can
pick
the
age
you
want
to
remain
karl
is
sure
he
can
do
that
assuming
the
beta
worked
with
you
and
now
we
see
it
has
the
first
memberships
will
naturally
be
somewhat
expensive
but
as
time
goes
by
the
cost
will
be
gradually
scaled
down
to
respond
to
market
forces
one
may
only
join
with
a
companion
but
for
obvious
reasons
all
those
who
undergo
the
beta
must
be
sworn
to
secrecy
on
pain
of
death
since
there
bound
to
be
a
hue
and
cry
and
government
intervention
if
word
leaks
out
that
only
individuals
with
significant
resources
can
have
this
miracle
i
think
that
obscene
she
said
i
suspected
you
might
feel
that
way
which
is
why
we
having
this
talk
as
i
explained
the
methuselah
society
will
be
contingent
on
the
utmost
secrecy
at
least
initially
so
the
question
is
are
you
on
board
with
this
the
answer
is
i
do
what
i
please
she
was
thinking
what
a
bombshell
this
would
be
to
have
in
stone
book
stem
cells
the
fountain
of
youth
was
no
longer
a
dream
winston
bartlett
had
won
his
dice
game
with
god
and
now
he
was
planning
to
sweep
the
table
but
he
also
was
smart
enough
to
realize
he
had
to
cash
in
quickly
and
discreetly
do
you
realize
how
irresponsible
that
is
he
insisted
we
stand
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
era
for
humankind
but
if
we
let
politicians
get
involved
with
this
they
might
decide
to
forbid
keep
in
mind
that
using
stem
cell
technology
to
regenerate
organs
is
already
controversial
just
imagine
what
the
zealots
would
do
with
this
the
good
of
humanity
is
less
important
to
them
than
their
bigoted
constituencies
that
was
when
it
finally
dawned
on
her
why
he
had
lured
her
down
here
by
the
river
on
a
rainy
night
what
better
place
for
a
convenient
accident
if
it
came
to
that
she
watched
as
he
turned
and
raised
a
finger
toward
the
open
door
of
the
mcdonnell
douglas
the
motor
started
and
then
another
figure
emerged
and
came
down
the
steps
she
squinted
through
the
rain
and
recognized
kenji
noda
bartlett
bodyguard
he
was
carrying
a
plastic
bottle
along
with
a
small
white
towel
he
going
to
chloroform
me
and
then
god
knows
what
i
about
to
disappear
the
same
way
kristen
did
she
stared
at
them
both
wondering
what
to
do
alexa
i
regret
to
say
that
you
are
either
with
me
or
you
are
a
problem
i
can
not
afford
to
have
bartlett
said
and
then
he
nodded
to
noda
shit
she
backed
to
the
edge
of
the
pier
as
noda
advanced
on
her
menacingly
dousing
the
cloth
he
was
a
foot
taller
than
she
was
and
he
weighed
over
two
hundred
pounds
her
first
instinct
was
to
run
but
then
she
sensed
an
impulse
to
stand
her
ground
something
told
her
to
try
to
use
her
strength
against
him
he
would
expect
it
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
she
noticed
that
a
white
car
had
pulled
onto
the
pier
and
was
cruising
down
the
side
slowly
inching
their
way
it
looked
like
a
police
vehicle
probably
a
couple
of
cops
curious
about
the
presence
of
a
helicopter
on
the
field
turf
they
were
approximately
half
a
minute
too
late
to
make
any
difference
kenji
noda
was
five
feet
away
and
they
were
fifty
yards
away
and
they
probably
could
see
what
was
going
on
anyway
the
rain
had
chosen
that
moment
to
begin
to
gush
shrouding
everything
in
sheets
of
water
knickers
was
nudging
at
her
leg
as
though
urging
her
to
flee
and
again
she
thought
about
running
but
an
instinct
told
her
to
stand
her
ground
she
was
feeling
a
sensation
of
power
growing
in
her
limbs
she
found
herself
oddly
calm
as
kenji
noda
reached
her
then
wrapped
his
left
arm
around
her
neck
and
with
his
right
hand
clamped
the
cloth
over
her
nostrils
it
was
infused
with
chloroform
she
knew
the
smell
but
she
held
her
breath
then
it
happened
she
casually
reached
up
and
took
his
left
arm
and
pulled
it
away
from
her
neck
it
was
so
easy
there
was
the
same
feeling
of
strength
she
had
when
she
wrenched
open
the
air
lock
yet
it
was
something
that
came
and
went
she
had
no
inkling
how
long
it
would
last
this
time
i
do
think
you
should
do
that
she
said
continuing
to
pull
his
arm
around
behind
him
then
she
twisted
it
to
the
side
and
there
was
a
sickening
snap
as
it
came
out
of
its
shoulder
socket
he
groaned
lightly
but
did
not
speak
instead
he
reached
with
his
right
hand
and
pulled
an
automatic
out
of
a
holster
at
the
back
of
his
belt
dropping
the
chloroformed
cloth
in
the
process
while
his
left
arm
dangled
uselessly
he
brought
around
the
pistol
and
tried
to
aim
it
at
her
torso
her
senses
though
were
coming
fully
alive
now
and
she
seized
his
wrist
and
pushed
it
away
just
as
he
fired
the
round
caught
her
at
the
outer
edge
of
her
shoulder
she
felt
it
enter
and
exit
but
there
was
no
pain
merely
a
mild
itch
still
holding
his
wrist
she
picked
up
the
white
cloth
and
buried
his
face
in
it
she
held
it
against
his
nostrils
until
his
body
twitched
and
went
limp
that
was
when
the
spotlight
hit
them
drop
your
weapons
and
show
your
hands
came
a
basso
voice
over
a
megaphone
who
had
a
weapon
she
wondered
the
one
pistol
around
was
lying
on
the
ground
next
to
the
crumpled
frame
of
kenji
noda
the
police
must
have
heard
the
shot
and
assumed
they
were
being
fired
on
she
turned
around
to
search
for
winston
bartlett
and
saw
him
retreating
to
the
mcdonnell
douglas
running
actually
he
saw
what
happened
she
told
herself
he
afraid
of
me
stop
and
identify
yourself
came
the
police
megaphone
the
spotlight
was
now
squarely
on
bartlett
who
was
bounding
up
the
retractable
steps
without
looking
back
he
pulled
up
the
steps
and
slammed
the
door
the
rotor
had
already
begun
revving
higher
and
in
moments
the
chopper
had
begun
its
ascent
out
over
the
dark
river
you
have
been
warned
to
identify
yourself
came
the
futile
megaphone
the
chopper
had
all
but
disappeared
into
the
dark
and
rain
when
she
heard
a
shot
fired
from
the
direction
of
the
police
car
it
must
have
been
an
accident
she
told
herself
there
no
way
but
the
smooth
hum
of
the
engine
dying
away
in
the
fog
abruptly
changed
tone
then
started
to
sputter
ten
seconds
later
there
was
silence
she
was
so
engaged
she
did
notice
the
stirring
at
her
feet
a
moment
thereafter
she
saw
the
towering
bulk
of
kenji
noda
rise
up
beside
her
then
she
felt
his
grip
on
her
wrist
and
realized
he
was
dragging
and
pulling
her
to
the
edge
of
the
pier
then
she
felt
a
shove
and
a
swirl
of
dark
air
around
her
followed
by
the
splash
of
cold
water
surprisingly
it
did
really
feel
freezing
it
just
felt
refreshingly
brisk
with
one
hand
she
grabbed
one
of
the
square
concrete
pillars
that
was
supporting
the
pier
the
mysterious
strength
she
had
from
time
to
time
was
coming
back
once
more
that
was
when
she
heard
a
vicious
howl
that
transmuted
into
a
growl
and
the
next
thing
she
saw
was
a
hazy
form
hurtle
past
her
and
splash
into
the
water
actually
it
was
two
forms
and
the
darker
one
was
flailing
while
the
lighter
one
bore
down
on
him
her
teeth
on
his
throat
no
she
screamed
do
as
the
pair
drifted
past
her
in
the
current
still
linked
she
reached
out
and
seized
knickers
collar
yanking
her
back
then
she
watched
helplessly
as
kenji
noda
disappeared
into
the
dark
could
he
swim
with
one
arm
the
cops
were
futilely
searching
the
wide
river
with
their
searchlight
looking
for
the
helicopter
for
anything
but
there
was
nothing
left
to
see
she
quietly
made
for
shore
even
as
she
and
knickers
were
being
swept
downstream
by
the
current
when
they
finally
reached
the
bank
it
was
somewhere
around
morton
street
oddly
enough
she
was
cold
and
she
was
tired
when
she
drew
herself
up
onto
the
rocks
knickers
at
her
side
she
just
lay
panting
for
a
moment
come
here
baby
she
said
drawing
knickers
to
her
the
dog
was
shivering
and
she
knew
she
had
to
get
her
home
soon
thank
god
you
ca
talk
i
think
something
very
evil
just
passed
from
the
world
epilogue
june
you
really
something
stone
declared
falling
back
onto
the
rumpled
sheets
what
come
over
you
lately
do
you
ever
get
tired
maybe
i
just
happy
to
be
alive
ally
said
smiling
as
she
ran
a
finger
down
his
chest
i
catching
up
on
all
the
living
i
been
missing
out
on
her
heart
was
definitely
on
the
mend
in
several
ways
she
was
beginning
to
think
she
was
in
love
after
steve
went
missing
she
thought
that
love
would
never
happen
again
but
maybe
it
had
know
what
he
said
rising
up
i
really
worked
up
an
appetite
how
about
you
think
i
make
an
omelet
got
any
eggs
left
in
the
fridge
should
be
some
she
said
but
i
pass
anything
i
eat
after
ten
goes
straight
to
places
on
my
body
that
do
need
further
reinforcement
it
was
so
nice
just
to
have
someone
to
be
near
again
her
nervous
system
was
still
recovering
from
the
harrowing
experience
down
on
the
pier
in
fact
she
was
really
sure
had
happened
the
crashed
mcdonnell
douglas
was
retrieved
from
the
water
the
next
day
but
there
were
no
bodies
aboard
had
winston
bartlett
drowned
and
his
body
been
swept
out
to
sea
by
the
tide
also
there
must
have
been
a
third
person
a
pilot
and
what
about
kenji
noda
who
also
was
missing
did
he
make
it
to
shore
in
any
case
they
all
had
disappeared
the
case
was
closed
and
since
nobody
had
found
a
will
new
york
state
was
currently
the
executor
of
his
fortune
eileen
bartlett
was
sole
heir
her
waiting
game
had
paid
off
superbly
the
price
of
her
gerex
shares
was
doubling
every
two
weeks
she
was
about
to
become
a
very
rich
woman
indeed
but
had
winston
bartlett
really
gone
to
a
watery
grave
ally
somehow
doubted
it
he
had
too
much
invested
in
life
to
cash
in
so
easily
as
she
watched
stone
get
up
and
swathe
himself
in
a
huge
white
towel
before
heading
for
the
kitchen
she
found
herself
replaying
that
harrowing
scene
at
the
pier
she
kept
trying
to
remember
something
bartlett
had
said
about
forming
some
kind
of
society
was
she
fantasizing
or
had
he
said
he
was
going
to
do
that
and
then
offer
the
beta
procedure
to
its
members
what
was
he
going
to
call
it
try
as
she
might
she
could
remember
she
had
developed
a
mental
block
that
her
mind
was
using
to
shield
her
psyche
from
the
horror
of
that
evening
that
night
she
first
considered
going
to
vincent
hospital
emergency
room
for
the
gunshot
wound
but
then
she
thought
it
over
and
decided
there
were
too
many
things
to
explain
that
could
be
explained
instead
she
just
went
home
and
washed
the
wound
and
filled
it
up
with
neosporin
she
did
even
tell
nina
the
next
morning
scar
tissue
was
already
forming
now
it
was
completely
healed
and
even
the
scar
had
all
but
disappeared
had
the
beta
really
worked
she
wanted
to
tell
stone
about
that
possibility
but
she
was
sure
how
he
would
take
it
and
she
absolutely
did
not
want
to
end
up
in
the
book
she
pulled
on
a
terry
cloth
robe
and
slippers
and
padded
her
way
into
the
kitchen
she
was
hungry
but
she
felt
like
a
glass
of
wine
she
poked
around
in
the
wine
rack
in
the
kitchen
closet
and
came
up
with
a
bottle
of
bordeaux
stone
was
cracking
large
white
eggs
into
a
stoneware
bowl
sure
i
ca
make
some
for
you
he
asked
leaning
over
to
buss
her
hair
as
she
searched
in
the
drawer
for
a
corkscrew
i
gon
na
throw
in
some
cheddar
but
i
leave
it
out
if
that
does
work
for
you
i
just
want
a
glass
of
red
wine
she
said
retrieving
the
corkscrew
and
i
need
a
memory
jogging
what
a
word
that
makes
you
think
of
living
a
long
time
i
i
want
to
look
up
something
on
the
internet
and
i
do
know
how
to
start
what
kind
of
word
is
it
he
queried
i
a
wordsmith
twenty
questions
is
it
a
noun
a
verb
an
adjective
if
i
could
remember
that
i
might
be
able
to
come
up
with
it
he
was
tossing
a
quarter
stick
of
butter
into
the
pan
hey
i
once
learned
hypnosis
why
do
you
let
me
take
you
under
does
that
really
work
it
how
i
come
up
with
interview
stuff
sometimes
from
years
ago
we
really
do
have
a
complicated
memory
system
i
think
everything
you
ever
knew
is
buried
somewhere
maybe
in
a
tiny
little
wrinkle
she
suspected
he
might
be
right
in
this
case
the
repressed
info
was
still
there
it
just
had
been
deliberately
covered
over
and
hidden
so
do
you
want
to
hypnotize
me
you
sure
you
know
how
i
not
boasting
but
i
could
make
methuselah
remember
the
day
he
first
got
out
of
diapers
she
stared
at
him
my
god
i
think
that
it
methuselah
i
think
that
the
word
i
could
remember
she
kissed
him
on
the
mouth
enthusiastically
i
got
to
check
something
she
popped
the
cork
and
poured
herself
a
glass
want
some
i
not
sure
what
goes
with
eggs
at
this
time
of
night
probably
tequila
good
luck
you
know
where
to
find
it
there
some
limes
in
the
fridge
right
now
i
going
to
fire
up
the
dell
and
do
a
little
search
now
his
face
dropped
how
about
a
little
romantic
whatever
come
and
join
me
bring
your
plate
we
go
exploring
in
cyberspace
it
be
a
romantic
voyage
i
got
a
hunch
about
something
she
walked
back
into
the
bedroom
and
clicked
on
the
computer
she
sipped
at
her
wine
deep
but
still
fruity
and
delicious
as
it
booted
up
what
going
on
he
asked
as
he
wandered
in
he
was
carrying
a
shot
glass
of
tequila
and
a
white
plate
with
the
cheese
omelette
the
aroma
was
seductive
i
want
to
check
out
something
i
have
to
be
honest
and
confess
been
holding
out
on
you
a
little
when
i
saw
winston
bartlett
that
night
on
the
pier
something
he
said
ally
i
need
to
do
some
confessing
too
the
time
never
seemed
quite
right
i
need
to
tell
you
something
about
him
well
do
tell
me
now
i
do
think
i
can
handle
anything
else
to
worry
about
tonight
please
save
it
she
was
logging
on
to
aol
then
she
went
to
the
search
engine
google
which
she
had
found
to
be
the
best
i
want
to
check
out
that
name
you
came
up
with
it
rang
a
bell
she
typed
in
methuselah
supposedly
the
guy
who
lived
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
there
were
pages
and
pages
of
references
relating
to
that
word
it
started
with
a
pine
tree
then
an
article
from
modern
maturity
on
how
to
extend
life
then
caltech
research
on
a
longevity
gene
then
a
rock
band
in
texas
undoubtedly
very
retro
a
short
story
by
isaac
bashevis
singer
and
so
it
went
what
exactly
are
you
looking
for
he
asked
holding
out
a
folk
here
want
a
bite
she
reached
and
tore
off
a
fluffy
corner
he
did
eggs
perfectly
thanks
she
said
chewing
now
she
was
moving
to
the
third
page
i
think
i
looking
for
an
organization
and
methuselah
was
in
the
name
at
least
that
what
i
seem
to
remember
i
definitely
repressing
a
lot
well
what
about
that
one
he
asked
pointing
the
line
read
the
methuselah
society
that
it
she
declared
now
i
remember
that
the
name
he
used
i
swear
so
it
real
i
not
crazy
what
are
you
talking
about
it
him
that
what
he
said
he
was
going
to
do
she
clicked
on
the
name
the
web
page
came
up
and
it
was
strictly
in
black
and
white
with
small
print
and
there
it
was
again
the
methuselah
society
there
was
no
information
beyond
a
request
for
a
secure
address
looks
like
they
want
to
check
you
out
stone
said
to
make
sure
you
not
connected
to
politics
or
law
enforcement
then
why
not
give
it
a
shot
stone
said
you
on
aol
you
have
to
be
a
civilian
she
typed
in
her
address
and
entered
it
immediately
a
little
yellow
padlock
appeared
in
the
lower
corner
indicating
their
communication
was
secure
then
a
notice
materialized
a
small
square
flickering
to
life
it
contained
her
phone
number
and
then
her
name
next
a
complete
financial
record
began
to
scroll
down
it
had
been
elicited
from
banks
mortgage
companies
credit
services
there
was
value
of
real
estate
owned
mortgages
outstanding
bank
accounts
outstanding
obligations
estimated
net
worth
it
had
all
appeared
in
a
time
span
of
seconds
wow
stone
said
there
are
no
secrets
left
from
these
guys
whoever
they
are
they
are
wired
then
a
message
appeared
the
minimum
net
worth
required
to
be
a
member
is
million
dollars
the
fee
for
membership
is
million
dollars
a
retainer
is
required
while
your
application
is
being
processed
please
be
prepared
to
designate
the
ages
you
and
your
companion
wish
to
remain
my
god
she
said
that
him
he
done
it
winston
bartlett
is
alive
and
well
and
selling
immortality
real
or
not
then
another
message
came
up
welcome
alexa
please
be
advised
you
are
already
a
member
but
you
have
not
yet
selected
a
companion
afterword
how
much
of
the
foregoing
is
true
or
even
plausible
in
late
medical
researchers
in
dusseldorf
announced
they
had
successfully
treated
victims
using
stem
cells
harvested
from
the
patients
own
bone
marrow
the
stem
cells
were
delivered
to
damaged
heart
muscle
via
angioplasty
catheters
a
minimally
invasive
procedure
subsequent
monitoring
indicated
that
the
stem
cells
had
reduced
the
damage
to
tissue
and
had
improved
their
heart
function
when
compared
to
similar
patients
in
a
control
group
who
had
declined
the
procedure
it
already
happening
the
miraculous
stem
cell
cures
in
this
story
are
essentially
an
extrapolation
of
research
well
underway
that
has
been
the
subject
of
magazine
covers
and
is
possibly
the
most
promising
and
yes
problematic
field
of
medical
research
the
clocks
at
the
dorian
institute
ran
faster
than
ordinary
timepieces
and
research
areas
and
cures
that
currently
are
only
speculation
were
made
real
there
but
that
why
it
called
fiction
as
with
the
example
cited
above
many
stem
cell
miracles
conjured
here
may
be
just
over
the
horizon
as
for
kristen
and
the
methuselah
society
they
are
a
fictional
embodiment
of
misgivings
given
voice
by
many
including
no
less
an
authority
than
professor
leonard
hayflick
whose
hayflick
limit
defining
the
process
of
how
cells
grow
old
could
be
said
to
be
the
underpinning
of
modern
stem
cell
research
he
is
now
a
leading
bioethicist
who
is
sufficiently
convinced
of
our
potential
to
use
stem
cells
to
arrest
the
actual
aging
process
that
he
has
worried
about
its
ramifications
in
print
he
makes
no
claim
that
such
a
thing
is
imminent
but
he
does
dismiss
its
possibility
either
he
has
reaching
societal
concerns
about
this
and
he
also
raises
biological
issues
such
as
if
you
treated
your
brain
malady
by
using
stem
cells
to
grow
new
neural
tissue
have
you
altered
your
mind
