a
tale
of
the
second
coming
by
upton
sinclair
new
york
to
charles
nevens
true
and
devoted
friend
i
the
beginning
of
this
strange
adventure
was
my
going
to
see
a
motion
picture
which
had
been
made
in
germany
it
was
three
years
after
the
end
of
the
war
and
you
have
thought
that
the
people
of
western
city
would
have
got
over
their
but
apparently
they
had
anyway
there
was
a
mob
to
keep
anyone
from
getting
into
the
theatre
and
all
the
other
mobs
started
from
that
before
i
tell
about
it
i
must
introduce
karl
henner
the
literary
critic
from
berlin
who
was
travelling
in
this
country
and
stopped
off
in
western
city
at
that
time
henner
was
the
cause
of
my
going
to
see
the
picture
and
if
you
will
have
a
moment
patience
you
will
see
how
the
ideas
which
he
put
into
my
head
served
to
start
me
on
my
extraordinary
adventure
you
may
not
know
much
about
these
cultured
foreigners
their
manners
are
like
softest
velvet
so
that
when
you
talk
to
them
you
feel
as
a
persian
cat
must
feel
while
being
stroked
they
have
read
everything
in
the
world
they
speak
with
quiet
certainty
and
they
are
so
old
old
with
memories
of
racial
griefs
stored
up
in
their
souls
i
who
know
myself
for
a
member
of
the
best
clubs
in
western
city
and
of
the
best
college
fraternity
in
the
country
i
found
myself
suddenly
indisposed
to
mention
that
i
had
helped
to
win
the
battle
of
the
argonne
this
foreign
visitor
asked
me
how
i
felt
about
the
war
and
i
told
him
that
it
was
over
and
i
bore
no
hard
feelings
but
of
course
i
was
glad
that
prussian
militarism
was
finished
he
answered
a
painful
operation
and
we
all
hope
that
the
patient
may
survive
it
also
we
hope
that
the
surgeon
has
not
contracted
the
just
as
quietly
as
that
of
course
i
asked
henner
what
he
thought
about
america
his
answer
was
that
we
had
succeeded
in
producing
the
material
means
of
civilization
by
the
ton
where
other
nations
had
produced
them
by
the
pound
we
intellectuals
in
europe
have
always
been
poor
by
your
standards
over
here
we
have
to
make
a
very
little
food
support
a
great
many
ideas
but
you
have
unlimited
quantities
of
food
and
well
we
seek
for
the
ideas
and
we
judge
by
analogy
they
must
exist
but
you
do
find
them
i
laughed
well
said
he
i
have
come
to
seek
this
talk
occurred
while
we
were
strolling
down
our
broadway
in
western
city
one
bright
afternoon
in
the
late
fall
of
we
talked
about
the
picture
which
henner
had
recommended
to
me
and
which
we
were
now
going
to
see
it
was
called
the
cabinet
of
caligari
and
was
a
futurist
production
a
strange
weird
freak
of
the
cinema
art
supposed
to
be
the
nightmare
of
a
madman
being
an
american
said
henner
you
will
find
yourself
asking
good
does
such
a
picture
do
you
will
have
the
idea
that
every
work
of
art
must
serve
some
moral
after
a
pause
he
added
this
picture
could
not
possibly
have
been
produced
in
america
for
one
thing
nearly
all
the
characters
are
he
said
it
with
the
flicker
of
a
smile
one
does
not
find
american
screen
actors
in
that
condition
do
your
people
care
enough
about
the
life
of
art
to
take
a
risk
of
starving
for
it
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
had
at
that
time
several
millions
of
people
out
of
work
in
america
and
many
of
them
starving
there
must
be
some
intellectuals
among
them
i
suggested
and
the
critic
replied
they
must
have
starved
for
so
long
that
they
have
got
used
to
it
and
can
enjoy
it
or
at
any
rate
can
enjoy
turning
it
into
art
is
not
that
the
final
test
of
great
art
that
it
has
been
smelted
in
the
fires
of
suffering
all
the
great
spiritual
movements
of
humanity
began
in
that
way
take
primitive
christianity
for
example
but
you
americans
have
taken
christ
the
carpenter
i
laughed
it
happened
that
at
this
moment
we
were
passing
bartholomew
church
a
great
structure
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
park
i
waved
my
hand
towards
it
in
there
i
said
over
the
altar
you
may
see
christ
the
carpenter
dressed
up
in
exquisite
robes
of
white
and
amethyst
set
up
as
a
stained
glass
window
ornament
but
if
you
stop
and
think
you
realize
it
was
we
americans
who
began
that
no
said
the
other
returning
my
laugh
but
i
think
it
was
you
who
finished
him
up
as
a
symbol
of
elegance
a
divinity
of
the
respectable
thus
chatting
we
turned
the
corner
and
came
in
sight
of
our
goal
the
excelsior
theatre
and
there
was
the
mob
ii
at
first
when
i
saw
the
mass
of
people
i
thought
it
was
the
usual
picture
crowd
i
said
with
a
smile
can
it
be
that
the
american
people
are
not
so
dead
to
art
after
all
but
then
i
observed
that
the
crowd
seemed
to
be
swaying
this
way
and
that
also
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
many
men
in
army
uniforms
hello
i
exclaimed
a
row
there
was
a
clamor
of
shouting
the
army
men
seemed
to
be
pulling
and
pushing
the
civilians
when
we
got
nearer
i
asked
of
a
bystander
what
up
the
answer
was
they
do
want
to
go
in
to
see
the
why
not
it
german
hun
propaganda
now
you
must
understand
i
had
helped
to
win
a
war
and
no
man
gets
over
such
an
experience
at
once
i
had
a
flash
of
suspicion
and
glanced
at
my
companion
the
cultured
literary
critic
from
berlin
could
it
possibly
be
that
this
gentleman
was
playing
a
trick
upon
me
trying
possibly
to
get
something
into
my
crude
american
mind
without
my
realizing
what
was
happening
but
i
remembered
his
detailed
account
of
the
production
the
very
essence
of
art
for
art
i
decided
that
the
war
was
three
years
over
and
i
was
competent
to
do
my
own
thinking
henner
spoke
first
i
think
he
said
it
might
be
wiser
if
i
did
not
try
to
go
in
absurd
i
cried
i
not
going
to
be
dictated
to
by
a
bunch
of
imbeciles
no
said
the
other
you
are
an
american
and
do
have
to
be
but
i
am
a
german
and
i
must
i
noted
the
flash
of
bitterness
but
did
not
resent
it
that
all
nonsense
henner
i
argued
you
are
my
guest
and
i
wo
listen
my
friend
said
the
other
you
can
doubtless
get
by
without
trouble
but
i
would
surely
rouse
their
anger
and
i
have
no
mind
to
be
beaten
for
nothing
i
have
seen
the
picture
several
times
and
can
talk
about
it
with
you
just
as
you
make
me
ashamed
of
myself
i
cried
and
of
my
country
no
no
it
is
what
you
should
expect
it
is
what
i
had
in
mind
when
i
spoke
of
the
surgeon
contracting
the
disease
we
german
intellectuals
know
what
war
means
we
are
used
to
things
like
suddenly
he
put
out
his
hand
i
will
go
with
you
i
exclaimed
but
he
protested
that
would
embarrass
him
greatly
i
would
please
to
stay
and
see
the
picture
he
would
be
interested
later
on
to
hear
my
opinion
of
it
and
abruptly
he
turned
and
walked
off
leaving
me
hesitating
and
angry
at
last
i
started
towards
the
entrance
of
the
theatre
one
of
the
men
in
uniform
barred
my
way
no
admittance
here
but
why
not
it
a
german
show
and
we
aint
to
allow
now
see
here
buddy
i
countered
none
too
i
have
got
my
uniform
on
but
i
as
good
a
right
to
it
as
you
i
was
all
through
the
well
what
do
you
want
to
see
hun
propaganda
for
maybe
i
want
to
see
what
it
well
you
ca
go
in
we
here
to
shut
up
this
show
i
had
stepped
to
one
side
as
i
spoke
and
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
i
thought
there
had
been
talk
enough
and
gave
a
sudden
lurch
and
tore
my
arm
free
hold
on
here
he
shouted
and
tried
to
stop
me
again
but
i
sprang
through
the
crowd
towards
the
there
were
more
than
a
hundred
civilians
in
or
about
the
lobby
and
not
more
than
twenty
or
thirty
men
maintaining
the
blockade
so
a
few
got
by
and
i
was
one
of
the
lucky
ones
i
bought
my
ticket
and
entered
the
theatre
to
the
man
at
the
door
i
said
who
started
this
i
do
know
sir
it
just
landed
on
us
and
we
have
had
time
to
find
is
the
picture
german
propaganda
nothing
like
that
at
all
sir
they
say
they
wo
let
us
show
german
pictures
because
they
so
much
cheaper
they
put
pictures
out
of
business
and
it
unfair
oh
i
exclaimed
and
light
began
to
dawn
i
recalled
remark
about
producing
a
great
many
ideas
out
of
a
very
little
food
assuredly
the
american
picture
industry
had
cause
to
fear
competition
of
that
sort
i
thought
of
old
as
the
screen
people
call
him
for
short
the
king
of
the
movie
world
with
his
roll
of
fat
hanging
over
his
collar
and
his
two
or
three
extra
chins
i
though
of
mary
magna
million
dollar
queen
of
the
pictures
contriving
diets
and
exercises
for
herself
and
weighing
with
fear
and
trembling
every
day
iii
it
was
time
for
the
picture
to
begin
so
i
smoothed
my
coat
and
went
to
a
seat
and
was
one
of
perhaps
two
dozen
spectators
before
whom
the
cabinet
of
caligari
received
its
first
public
showing
in
western
city
the
story
had
to
do
with
a
series
of
murders
we
saw
them
traced
by
a
young
man
and
fastened
bit
by
bit
upon
an
old
magician
and
doctor
as
the
drama
neared
its
climax
we
discovered
this
doctor
to
be
the
head
of
an
asylum
for
the
insane
and
the
young
man
to
be
one
of
the
inmates
so
in
the
end
the
series
of
adventures
was
revealed
to
us
as
the
imaginings
of
a
madman
about
his
physician
and
keepers
the
settings
and
scenery
were
in
the
style
of
futurist
art
weird
and
highly
effective
i
saw
it
all
in
the
light
of
henner
interpretation
the
product
of
an
old
perhaps
an
overripe
culture
certainly
no
such
picture
could
have
been
produced
in
america
if
i
had
to
choose
between
this
and
the
luxurious
of
mary
magna
well
i
wondered
at
least
i
had
been
interested
in
every
moment
of
dr
caligari
and
i
was
only
interested
in
mary
off
the
screen
several
times
every
year
i
had
to
choose
between
mortally
hurting
her
feelings
and
watching
her
elaborate
vamping
through
eight
or
ten
costly
reels
i
had
read
many
stories
and
seen
a
great
many
plays
in
which
the
hero
wakes
up
in
the
end
and
we
realize
that
we
have
been
watching
a
dream
i
remembered
midsummer
night
dream
and
also
looking
an
old
old
device
of
art
and
yet
always
effective
one
of
the
most
effective
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
been
taken
into
the
dreams
of
a
lunatic
yes
it
was
interesting
there
was
no
denying
it
grisly
stuff
but
alive
and
marvelously
well
acted
how
edgar
allen
poe
would
have
revelled
in
it
so
thinking
i
walked
towards
the
exit
of
the
theatre
and
a
swinging
door
gave
way
and
upon
my
ear
broke
a
clamor
that
might
have
come
direct
from
the
inside
of
caligari
asylum
ya
ya
boo
boo
german
propaganda
pay
your
money
to
the
huns
for
shame
on
you
leave
your
own
people
to
starve
and
send
your
cash
to
the
i
stopped
still
and
whispered
to
myself
my
god
during
all
the
time
an
hour
or
more
that
i
had
been
away
on
the
wings
of
imagination
these
poor
boobs
had
been
howling
and
whooping
outside
the
theatre
keeping
the
crowds
away
and
incidentally
working
themselves
into
a
fury
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
would
go
out
and
reason
with
them
they
were
mistaken
in
the
idea
that
there
was
anything
about
the
war
anything
against
america
in
the
picture
but
i
realized
that
they
were
beyond
reason
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
my
way
and
let
them
rave
but
quickly
i
saw
that
this
was
not
going
to
be
so
easy
as
i
had
fancied
right
in
front
of
the
entrance
stood
the
big
fellow
who
had
caught
my
arm
and
as
i
came
toward
him
i
saw
that
he
had
me
marked
he
pointed
a
finger
into
my
face
shouting
in
a
voice
there
a
traitor
says
he
was
in
the
service
and
now
he
backing
the
huns
i
tried
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
but
he
got
me
by
the
arm
and
others
were
around
me
yein
yein
yein
they
shouted
into
my
ear
and
as
i
tried
to
make
my
way
through
they
began
to
hustle
me
i
shove
your
face
in
you
damned
hun
a
continual
string
of
such
abuse
and
i
had
been
in
the
service
and
seen
fighting
i
never
tried
harder
to
avoid
trouble
i
wanted
to
get
away
but
that
big
fellow
stuck
his
feet
between
mine
and
tripped
me
he
lunged
and
shoved
me
into
the
gutter
and
so
of
course
i
made
to
hit
him
but
they
had
me
helpless
i
had
no
more
than
clenched
my
fist
and
drawn
back
my
arm
when
i
received
a
violent
blow
on
the
side
of
my
jaw
i
never
knew
what
hit
me
a
fist
or
a
weapon
i
only
felt
the
crash
and
a
sensation
of
reeling
and
a
series
of
blows
and
kicks
like
a
storm
about
me
i
ask
you
to
believe
that
i
did
not
run
away
in
the
argonne
i
did
my
job
and
got
my
wound
and
my
honorable
record
but
there
i
had
a
fighting
chance
and
here
i
had
none
and
maybe
i
was
dazed
and
it
was
the
instinctive
reaction
of
my
tormented
body
anyhow
i
ran
i
staggered
along
with
the
blows
and
kicks
to
keep
me
moving
and
then
i
saw
half
a
dozen
broad
steps
and
a
big
open
doorway
i
fled
that
way
and
found
myself
in
a
dark
cool
place
reeling
like
a
drunken
man
but
no
longer
beaten
and
apparently
no
longer
pursued
i
was
falling
and
there
was
something
nearby
and
i
caught
at
it
and
sank
down
upon
a
sort
of
wooden
bench
iv
i
had
run
into
bartholomew
church
and
when
i
came
to
i
fear
i
cut
a
pitiful
figure
but
i
have
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
crying
i
do
think
the
pain
of
my
head
and
face
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
think
it
was
rage
and
humiliation
my
sense
of
outrage
that
i
who
had
helped
to
win
a
war
should
have
been
made
to
run
from
a
gang
of
cowardly
rowdies
anyhow
here
i
was
sunk
down
in
a
pew
of
the
church
sobbing
as
if
my
heart
was
broken
at
last
i
raised
my
head
and
holding
on
to
the
pew
in
front
looked
about
me
the
church
was
apparently
deserted
there
were
dark
vistas
and
directly
in
front
of
me
a
gleaming
altar
and
high
over
it
a
stained
glass
window
with
the
afternoon
sun
shining
through
you
know
of
course
the
sort
of
figures
they
have
in
those
windows
a
man
in
long
robes
white
with
purple
and
gold
with
a
brown
beard
and
a
gentle
sad
face
and
a
halo
of
light
about
the
head
i
was
staring
at
the
figure
and
at
the
same
time
choking
with
rage
and
pain
but
clenching
my
hands
and
making
up
my
mind
to
go
out
and
follow
those
brutes
and
get
that
big
one
alone
and
pound
his
face
to
a
jelly
and
here
begins
the
strange
part
of
my
adventure
suddenly
that
shining
figure
stretched
out
its
two
arms
to
me
as
if
imploring
me
not
to
think
those
vengeful
thoughts
i
knew
of
course
what
it
meant
i
had
just
seen
a
play
about
delirium
and
had
got
a
whack
on
the
head
and
now
i
was
delirious
myself
i
thought
i
must
be
badly
hurt
i
bowed
my
reeling
head
in
my
arms
and
began
to
sob
like
a
kid
out
loud
and
without
shame
but
somehow
i
forgot
about
the
big
brute
and
his
face
that
i
wanted
to
pound
instead
i
was
ashamed
and
bewildered
a
queer
hysterical
state
with
a
half
dozen
emotions
mixed
up
the
caligari
story
was
in
it
and
the
lunatic
asylum
i
got
a
cracked
skull
i
thought
and
my
mind
will
never
get
right
again
i
sat
huddled
and
shuddering
until
suddenly
i
felt
a
quiet
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
heard
a
gentle
voice
saying
do
be
afraid
it
is
now
i
shall
waste
no
time
telling
you
how
amazed
i
was
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
could
believe
what
was
happening
to
me
i
thought
i
was
clean
off
my
head
i
lifted
my
eyes
and
there
in
the
aisle
of
the
most
decorous
church
of
bartholomew
standing
with
his
hand
on
my
head
was
the
figure
out
of
the
stained
glass
window
i
looked
at
him
twice
and
then
i
looked
at
the
window
where
the
figure
had
been
was
a
great
big
hole
with
the
sun
shining
through
we
know
the
power
of
suggestion
and
especially
when
one
taps
the
deeps
of
the
unconscious
where
our
childhood
memories
are
buried
i
had
been
brought
up
in
a
religious
family
and
so
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
me
that
while
that
hand
lay
on
my
head
the
throbbing
and
whirling
should
cease
and
likewise
the
fear
i
became
perfectly
quiet
and
content
to
sit
under
the
friendly
spell
why
were
you
crying
asked
the
voice
at
last
i
answered
hesitatingly
i
think
it
was
is
it
something
you
have
done
no
something
that
was
done
to
but
how
can
a
man
be
humiliated
by
the
act
of
another
i
saw
what
he
meant
and
i
was
not
humiliated
any
more
the
stranger
spoke
again
a
mob
he
said
is
a
blind
thing
worse
than
madness
it
is
the
beast
in
man
running
away
with
his
i
thought
to
myself
how
can
he
know
what
has
happened
to
me
but
then
i
reflected
perhaps
he
saw
them
drive
me
into
the
church
i
found
myself
with
a
sudden
queer
impulse
to
apologize
for
those
soldier
boys
we
had
some
terrible
fighting
i
cried
and
you
know
what
wars
do
to
the
minds
of
the
people
i
yes
said
the
stranger
i
know
only
too
i
had
meant
to
explain
this
mob
but
somehow
i
decided
that
i
could
not
how
could
i
make
him
understand
moving
picture
shows
and
german
competition
and
men
out
of
jobs
there
was
a
pause
and
he
asked
can
you
stand
up
i
tried
and
found
that
i
could
i
felt
the
side
of
my
jaw
and
it
hurt
but
somehow
the
pain
seemed
apart
from
myself
i
could
see
clearly
and
steadily
there
were
only
two
things
wrong
that
i
could
find
first
this
stranger
standing
by
my
side
and
second
that
hole
in
the
window
where
i
had
seen
him
standing
so
many
sunday
mornings
are
you
going
out
now
he
asked
as
i
hesitated
he
added
tactfully
perhaps
you
would
let
me
go
with
you
here
was
indeed
a
startling
proposition
his
costume
his
long
hair
there
were
many
things
about
him
not
adapted
to
broadway
at
five
in
the
afternoon
but
what
could
i
say
it
would
be
rude
to
call
attention
to
his
peculiarities
all
i
could
manage
was
to
stammer
i
thought
you
belonged
in
the
do
i
he
replied
with
a
puzzled
look
i
not
sure
i
have
been
wondering
am
i
really
needed
here
and
am
i
not
more
needed
in
the
world
well
said
i
there
one
thing
i
pointed
up
to
the
window
that
hole
is
yes
that
is
and
if
it
should
rain
the
altar
would
be
ruined
the
reverend
would
be
dreadfully
distressed
that
altar
cloth
was
left
to
the
church
in
the
will
of
elvina
de
wiggs
and
god
knows
how
many
thousands
of
dollars
it
i
suppose
that
would
do
said
the
stranger
let
us
see
if
we
ca
find
something
to
put
he
started
up
the
aisle
and
through
the
chancel
i
followed
and
we
came
into
the
and
there
on
the
wall
i
noticed
a
full
length
portrait
of
old
algernon
de
wiggs
president
of
the
empire
national
bank
and
of
the
western
city
chamber
of
commerce
let
us
see
if
he
would
fill
the
place
said
the
stranger
and
to
my
amazement
he
drew
up
a
chair
and
took
down
the
huge
picture
and
carried
it
seemingly
without
effort
into
the
church
he
stepped
upon
the
altar
and
lifted
the
portrait
in
front
of
the
window
how
he
got
it
to
stay
there
i
am
not
sure
i
was
too
much
taken
aback
by
the
procedure
to
notice
such
details
there
the
picture
was
it
seemed
to
fit
the
window
exactly
and
the
effect
was
simply
colossal
you
have
to
know
old
de
wiggs
to
appreciate
it
those
round
puffy
cheeks
with
the
afternoon
sun
behind
them
making
them
shine
like
two
enormous
jonathan
apples
our
leading
banker
was
clad
in
decorous
black
as
always
on
sunday
mornings
but
in
one
place
the
sun
penetrated
his
form
at
one
side
of
his
chest
my
curiosity
got
the
better
of
me
i
could
not
restrain
the
question
what
is
that
golden
light
said
the
stranger
i
think
that
is
his
but
that
ca
be
i
argued
the
light
is
on
his
right
side
and
it
seems
to
have
an
oblong
shape
exactly
as
if
it
were
his
said
the
other
where
the
treasure
is
there
will
the
heart
be
vi
we
passed
out
through
the
arched
doorway
and
broadway
was
before
us
i
had
another
thrill
of
distress
a
vision
of
myself
walking
down
this
crowded
street
with
this
extraordinary
looking
personage
the
crowds
would
stare
at
us
the
street
urchins
would
swarm
about
us
until
we
blocked
the
traffic
and
the
police
ran
us
in
so
i
thought
as
we
descended
the
steps
and
started
but
my
fear
passed
for
we
walked
and
no
one
followed
us
hardly
did
anyone
even
turn
his
eyes
after
us
i
realized
in
a
little
while
how
this
could
be
the
pleasant
climate
of
western
city
brings
strange
visitors
to
dwell
here
we
have
hindoo
swamis
in
yellow
silk
and
a
theosophist
college
on
a
and
people
who
take
up
with
nature
and
go
about
with
sandals
and
bare
legs
and
a
mane
of
hair
over
their
shoulders
i
pass
them
on
the
street
now
and
then
one
of
them
carries
a
shepherd
crook
i
remember
how
a
few
years
ago
my
aunt
caroline
rambling
around
looking
for
something
to
satisfy
her
emotions
took
up
with
these
queer
ideas
and
there
came
to
her
front
door
to
the
infinite
bewilderment
of
the
butler
a
prophet
in
pastoral
robes
and
with
a
little
newspaper
bundle
in
his
hand
this
spread
out
before
my
aunt
proved
to
contain
three
carrots
and
two
onions
carefully
washed
and
shining
they
were
the
kindly
fruits
of
the
earth
and
of
the
prophet
own
labor
and
my
old
auntie
was
deeply
touched
because
it
appeared
that
this
visitor
was
a
seer
the
sole
composer
of
a
mighty
tome
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
public
library
and
is
known
as
the
eternal
so
here
i
was
strolling
along
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
with
my
strange
acquaintance
i
saw
that
he
was
looking
about
and
i
prepared
for
questions
and
wondered
what
they
would
be
i
thought
that
he
must
naturally
be
struck
by
such
wonders
as
automobiles
and
crowded
i
failed
to
realize
that
he
would
be
thinking
about
the
souls
of
the
people
said
he
at
last
this
is
a
large
city
about
half
a
and
what
quarter
are
we
in
the
shopping
is
it
a
segregated
district
segregated
in
what
way
apparently
there
are
only
i
could
not
help
laughing
you
are
misled
by
the
peculiarities
of
our
feminine
fashions
details
with
which
you
are
naturally
not
familiar
oh
quite
the
contrary
said
he
i
am
only
too
familiar
with
them
in
childhood
i
learned
the
words
of
the
prophet
the
daughters
of
zion
are
haughty
and
walk
with
stretched
forth
necks
and
wanton
eyes
walking
and
mincing
as
they
go
and
making
a
tinkling
with
their
feet
therefore
the
lord
will
smite
with
a
scab
the
crown
of
the
head
of
the
daughters
of
zion
and
the
lord
will
discover
their
secret
parts
in
that
day
the
lord
will
take
away
the
bravery
of
their
tinkling
ornaments
about
their
feet
and
their
cauls
and
their
round
tires
like
the
moon
the
chains
and
the
bracelets
and
the
mufflers
the
bonnets
and
the
ornaments
of
the
legs
and
the
headbands
and
the
tablets
and
the
earrings
and
nose
jewels
the
changeable
suits
of
apparel
and
the
mantles
and
the
wimples
and
the
crisping
pins
the
glasses
and
the
fine
linen
and
the
hoods
and
the
veils
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
instead
of
sweet
smell
there
shall
be
stink
and
instead
of
a
girdle
a
rent
and
instead
of
well
set
hair
baldness
and
instead
of
a
stomacher
a
girding
of
sackcloth
and
burning
instead
of
beauty
from
the
point
of
view
of
literature
this
might
be
great
stuff
but
on
the
corner
of
broadway
and
fifth
street
at
the
crowded
hours
it
was
unusual
to
say
the
least
my
companion
was
entering
into
the
spirit
of
it
in
a
most
alarming
way
he
was
half
chanting
his
voice
rising
his
face
lighting
up
men
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
thy
mighty
in
the
war
and
her
gates
shall
lament
and
mourn
and
she
being
desolate
shall
sit
upon
the
ground
be
careful
i
whispered
people
will
hear
you
but
why
should
they
not
he
turned
on
me
a
look
of
surprise
the
people
hear
me
and
he
added
the
common
here
was
an
aspect
of
my
adventure
which
had
not
occurred
to
me
before
my
god
i
thought
if
he
takes
to
preaching
on
street
corners
i
realized
in
a
flash
it
was
exactly
what
he
would
be
up
to
a
panic
seized
me
i
could
stand
that
i
have
to
cut
and
run
i
began
to
speak
quickly
we
must
get
across
this
street
while
we
have
time
the
traffic
officer
has
turned
the
right
way
and
i
began
explaining
our
remarkable
system
of
traffic
handling
but
he
stopped
me
in
the
middle
why
do
we
wish
to
cross
the
street
when
we
have
no
place
to
go
i
have
a
place
i
wish
to
take
you
to
i
said
a
friend
i
want
you
to
meet
let
us
and
while
i
was
guiding
him
between
the
automobiles
i
was
desperately
trying
to
think
how
to
back
up
my
lie
who
was
there
that
would
receive
this
incredible
stranger
and
put
him
up
for
the
night
and
get
him
into
proper
clothes
and
keep
him
off
the
truly
i
was
in
an
extraordinary
position
what
had
i
done
to
get
this
stranger
wished
onto
me
and
how
long
was
he
going
to
stay
with
me
i
found
myself
recalling
the
plight
of
mary
who
had
a
little
lamb
fate
had
me
in
its
hands
and
did
not
mean
to
consult
me
we
had
gone
less
than
a
block
further
when
i
heard
a
voice
hello
billy
i
turned
oh
lord
oh
lord
of
all
the
thankless
encounters
edgerton
rosythe
moving
picture
critic
of
the
western
city
precisely
the
most
cynical
the
most
profane
the
most
boisterous
person
in
a
cynical
and
profane
and
boisterous
business
and
he
had
me
here
in
full
daylight
with
a
figure
just
out
of
a
stained
glass
window
in
bartholomew
church
vii

hand

the
other
and
rosythe
shot
an
arrow
of
laughter
towards
me
perhaps
he
knew
about
the
vagaries
of
my
aunt
caroline
anyhow
he
would
have
a
fantastic
tale
to
tell
about
me
and
was
going
to
exploit
it
to
the
limit
i
made
a
pitiful
attempt
to
protect
my
dignity

carpenter

began

the

oviparous

raised

hand

in
the
glory
of
his
wit
he
was
going
to
clap
the
stranger
on
the
shoulder
but
his
hand
stayed
in
the
air
such
a
look
as
came
on
face
hush
he
commanded
be
silent
and
then
any
man
will
join
in
laughter

oh

genuine
interest

of
himself

line

love
he
answered
gently

rosythe
i
broke
in
i
ca
stand
on
the
street
beginning
to
feel
seedy
again
i
think
i
have
a
no

the
critic
come
with
me
i
on
the
way
to
pick
up
the
missus
right
around
the
corner
a
fine
place
to
and
without
further
ado
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
led
me
along
he
was
a
chap
inside
his
rowdyisms
were
just
the
weapons
of
his
profession
we
went
into
an
office
building
and
entered
an
elevator
i
did
not
know
the
building
or
the
offices
we
came
to
rosythe
pushed
open
a
door
and
i
saw
before
me
a
spacious
parlor
with
birds
of
paradise
of
the
female
sex
lounging
in
upholstered
chairs
i
was
led
to
a
vast
plush
sofa
and
sank
into
it
with
a
sigh
of
relief
the
stranger
stood
beside
me
and
put
his
hand
on
my
head
once
more
it
was
truly
a
miracle
how
the
whirling
and
roaring
ceased
and
peace
came
back
to
me
it
must
have
shown
in
my
face
for
the
moving
picture
critic
of
the
western
city
times
stood
watching
me
with
a
quizzical
smile
playing
over
his
face
i
could
read
his
thoughts
as
well
as
if
he
had
uttered
them
regular
svengali
stuff
by
god
viii
i
was
so
comfortable
there
i
did
not
care
what
happened
i
closed
my
eyes
for
a
while
then
i
opened
them
and
gazed
lazily
about
the
place
i
noted
that
all
the
birds
of
paradise
were
watching
carpenter
with
one
accord
their
heads
had
turned
and
their
eyes
were
riveted
upon
him
i
found
myself
thinking
this
man
will
make
a
hit
with
the
ladies
like
the
swamis
with
their
soft
brown
skins
and
their
large
dark
eyes
there
had
been
silence
in
the
place
but
suddenly
we
all
heard
a
moan
i
felt
carpenter
start
and
his
hand
left
my
head
a
dozen
doors
gave
into
this
big
parlor
all
of
them
closed
we
perceived
that
the
sound
came
through
the
door
nearest
to
us
what
is
it
i
asked
of
rosythe
god
knows
said
he
you
never
can
tell
in
this
place
of
i
was
about
to
ask
what
sort
of
place
is
it
but
the
moan
came
again
louder
more
long
drawn
out
it
ended
in
a
sort
of
explosion
as
if
the
maker
of
it
had
burst
carpenter
turned
and
took
two
steps
towards
the
door
then
he
stopped
hesitating
my
eyes
followed
him
and
then
turned
to
the
critic
who
was
watching
carpenter
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
evidently
rosythe
was
going
to
have
some
fun
and
get
his
revenge
the
sound
came
again
louder
more
harrowing
it
came
at
regular
intervals
and
each
time
with
the
explosion
at
the
end
i
watched
carpenter
and
he
was
like
a
horse
that
hears
the
cracking
of
a
whip
over
his
head
the
creature
becomes
more
restless
he
starts
more
quickly
and
jumps
farther
at
each
sound
but
he
is
puzzled
he
does
not
know
what
these
lashes
mean
or
which
way
he
ought
to
run
carpenter
looked
from
one
to
another
of
us
searching
our
faces
he
looked
at
the
birds
of
paradise
in
the
lounging
chairs
not
one
of
them
moved
a
muscle
save
only
those
muscles
which
caused
their
eyes
to
follow
him
it
was
no
concern
of
theirs
this
agony
whatever
it
was
yet
plainly
it
was
the
sound
of
a
woman
in
torment
carpenter
wanted
to
open
that
door
his
hand
would
start
towards
it
then
he
would
turn
away
between
the
two
impulses
he
was
presently
pacing
the
room
and
since
there
was
no
one
who
appeared
to
have
any
interest
in
what
he
might
say
he
began
muttering
to
himself
i
would
catch
a
phrase
the
fate
of
woman
and
again
the
price
of
life
i
would
hear
the
terrible
explosive
wail
and
it
would
wring
a
cry
out
of
the
depths
of
carpenter
soul
oh
have
mercy
in
the
beginning
the
moving
picture
critic
of
the
western
city
times
had
made
some
effort
to
restrain
his
amusement
but
as
this
performance
went
on
his
face
became
one
enormous
grin
and
you
can
understand
that
made
him
seem
quite
devilish
i
saw
that
carpenter
was
more
and
more
goaded
by
it
he
would
look
at
rosythe
and
then
he
would
turn
away
in
aversion
but
at
last
he
made
an
effort
to
conquer
his
feelings
and
went
up
to
the
critic
and
said
gently
my
friend
for
every
man
who
lives
on
earth
some
woman
has
paid
the
price
of
the
price
of
life
repeated
the
critic
puzzled
carpenter
waved
his
hand
towards
the
door
we
confront
this
everlasting
mystery
this
everlasting
terror
and
it
is
not
becoming
that
you
should
the
grin
faded
from
the
other
face
his
brows
wrinkled
and
he
said
i
do
get
you
friend
what
can
a
man
do
at
least
he
can
bow
his
heart
he
can
pay
his
tribute
to
you
too
much
for
me
responded
rosythe
the
imbeciles
choose
to
go
through
with
it
it
their
own
said
carpenter
you
have
never
thought
of
it
as
the
choice
of
god
holy
smoke
exclaimed
the
critic
i
sure
never
did
at
that
moment
one
of
the
doors
was
opened
rosythe
turned
his
eyes
ah
madame
planchet
he
cried

room
smiling
in

she
had
black
earrings
flapping
from
each
ear
and
her
face
was
white
with
a
streak
of
scarlet
for

she
took
the
critic
by
his
two
hands
and
the
critic
laughing
said

intensity
of
concentration
on

face

trying
to
understand

situation

not
the
wondair
i
knew
by
now
where
i
was
i
had
heard
many
times
of
madame
planchet
i
sat
wondering
should
i
take
carpenter
by
the
arm
and
lead
him
gently
out
or
should
i
leave
him
to
fight
his
own
fight
with
modern
civilization
madame
turned
suddenly
upon
me
i
know
you
meester
billee
she
said
i
have
seen
you
with
mees
magna
ah
naughtee
boy
you

the
soft
fine
hair
you

let

inches
we

to
have
and
then
you

come
to
me
for
the
permanent
wave
so
many
young
men
come
to
me
for
the
permanent
wave
you
know
eet
meester
carpentair
you

he

i
say
always

bettair
than
nature
i
tell
nature
by
the
eemperfections
eh
voila
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
me
or
of
carpenter
the
deputee
of
the
god
of
beautee
was
moved
to
volunteer
a
great
revelation
would
you
like
to
see
how
we
make
eet
the
permanent
wave
i
weel
show
you
messes
but
you
must
not

she
would
not
like
eet
if
i
showed
her
to
gentlemen
but
her
back
ees
turned
and
she
can
not
move
we
do
not
let
them
see
the
apparatus
because
eet
ees
rather
frightful
eet
would
make
them
seek
you
will
be
very
steel
eh
mum
the
word
madame
said
rosythe
speaking
for
the
three
of
us
moaned
the
voice
first
i
weel
tell
you
said
madame
for
the
complete
wave
we
wind
the
hair
in
tight
leetle
coils
on
many
rods
eet
ees
very
delicate
operations
every
hair
must
be
just
so
not
one
crooked
not
one
must
we
skeep
eet
takes
a
long
time
two
hours
for
the
long
hair
and
eet
hurts
because
we
must
pull
eet
so
tight
we
wrap
each
coil
een
damp
cloths
and
we
put
them
een
the
contacts
and
we
turn
on
the
eelectreeceetee
and
then
eet
ees
many
hours
that
the
hair
ees
baked
ees
cooked
een
the
proper
curves
eh
now
very
steel
eef
you
please
and
softly
she
opened
the
door
x
before
us
loomed
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
mountain
of
red
female
flesh
this
had
once
apparently
been
slightly
covered
by
embroidered
silk
lingerie
but
this
was
now
soaked
in
moisture
and
reduced
to
the
texture
of
wet
tissue
paper
the
top
of
the
ended
in
an
amazing
spectacle
it
appeared
as
if
the
head
had
no
hair
whatever
but
starting
from
the
bare
scalp
was
an
extraordinary
number
of
thin
rods
six
inches
or
so
in
length
these
rods
stood
out
in
every
direction
and
being
of
gleaming
metal
they
gave
to
the
head
the
aspect
of
some
bright
phoebus
apollo
known
as
the
or
shall
i
say
some
fierce
maenad
with
electric
snakes
having
skins
or
shall
i
say
some
terrific
modern
pouring
poison
gases
from
a
forest
of
chemical
tubes
over
the
top
of
the
was
a
big
metal
object
a
shining
concave
dome
with
which
all
the
tubes
connected
so
that
a
stranger
to
the
procedure
could
not
have
felt
sure
whether
the
mountain
was
holding
up
the
dome
or
was
dangling
from
it
a
piece
of
symbolism
done
by
a
maniac
artist
whose
meaning
no
one
could
fathom
from
the
dome
there
was
given
heat
so
from
the
pores
of
the
came
perspiration
i
could
not
say
that
i
actually
saw
perspiration
flowing
from
any
particular
pore
it
is
my
understanding
that
pores
are
small
and
do
not
squirt
visible
jets
what
i
could
say
is
that
i
saw
little
trickles
uniting
to
form
brooks
and
brooks
to
form
rivers
which
ran
down
the
sides
of
the
and
mingled
in
an
ocean
on
the
floor
also
i
observed
that
when
exposed
to
heat
do
not
stand
up
of
their
own
consistency
but
have
a
tendency
to
melt
and
flatten
it
was
necessary
that
this
bulk
should
be
supported
so
there
were
three
attendants
one
securely
braced
under
each
armpit
and
the
third
with
a
more
precarious
grip
under
the
mountain
chin
every
thirty
seconds
or
so
the
heaving
sliding
mass
would
emit
one
of
those
explosive
groans
then
it
would
collapse
an
avalanche
would
threaten
to
slide
and
the
living
caryatids
would
shove
and
struggle
said
madame
planchet
in
her
the
serveece
of
the
young
god
of
beautee
and
my
fancy
took
flight
i
saw
proud
vestals
tending
sacred
flames
on
islands
in
blue
grecian
seas
i
saw
acolytes
waving
censers
and
grave
bearded
priests
walking
in
processions
crowned
with
i
wondered
if
ever
since
the
world
began
the
young
god
of
beautee
looking
down
from
his
crystal
throne
had
beheld
a
stranger
ritual
of
adoration
silently
we
drew
back
from
the
and
madame
closed
the
door
reducing
the
promethean
groans
and
the
strong
ammoniacal
odors
i
did
not
see
the
face
of
carpenter
because
he
had
turned
it
from
us
rosythe
favored
me
with
a
smile
and
whispered
your
friend
care
for
beautee
then
he
added
what
do
you
suppose
he
meant
by
that
stuff
about
price
of
life
and
choice
of
god
did
you
really
get
it
i
asked
i
damned
if
i
my
dear
fellow
i
said
you
did
tell
us
what
sort
of
place
this
was
and
carpenter
thought
it
must
be
a
the
moving
picture
critic
of
the
western
city
times
gave
me
one
wild
look
then
from
his
throat
there
came
a
sound
like
the
sudden
bleat
of
a
young
sheep
in
pain
it
caused
carpenter
to
start
and
madame
planchet
to
start
and
for
the
first
time
since
we
entered
the
place
the
birds
of
paradise
gave
signs
of
life
elsewhere
than
in
the
the
sheep
gave
a
second
bleat
and
then
a
third
and
rosythe
red
in
the
face
and
apparently
choking
turned
and
fled
to
the
corridor
madame
planchet
drew
me
apart
and
said
meester
billee
tell
me
something
ees
eet
true
that
thees
gentleman
ees
a
healer
he
takes
away
the
pains
he
did
it
for
me
i
answered
he
ees
vairy
handsome
eh
meester
billee
yes
that
is
i
have
an
idea
eet
ees
a
she
turned
to
my
friend
meester
carpentair
they
tell
me
that
you
heal
the
pains
i
think
eet
would
be
a
vairy
fine
thing
eef
you
would
come
to
my
parlor
and
attend
the
ladies
while
i
give
them
the
permanent
wave
and
while
i
skeen
them
and
make
them
the
dimples
and
the
sweet
smiles
they
suffer
so
the
poor
dears
and
eef
you
would
seet
and
hold
their
hands
they
would
love
eet
they
would
come
every
day
for
eet
and
you
would
be
famous
and
you
would
be
reech
you
would
meet
oh
such
lovely
ladies
the
best
people
in
the
ceety
come
to
my
beauty
parlors
and
they
would
adore
you
meester
carpentair
what
do
you
say
to
eet
it
struck
me
as
curious
as
i
looked
back
upon
it
madame
planchet
so
far
had
not
heard
the
sound
of
carpenter
voice
now
she
forced
him
to
speak
but
she
did
not
force
him
to
look
at
her
his
gaze
went
over
her
head
as
if
he
were
seeing
a
vision
he
recited
because
the
daughters
of
zion
are
haughty
and
walk
with
stretched
forth
necks
and
wanton
eyes
walking
and
mincing
as
they
go
and
making
a
tinkling
with
their
feet
therefore
the
lord
will
smite
with
a
scab
the
crown
of
the
head
of
the
daughters
of
zion
and
the
lord
will
discover
their
secret
oh
mon
dieu
cried
madame
planchet
in
that
day
the
lord
will
take
away
the
bravery
of
their
twinkling
ornaments
about
their
feet
and
their
cauls
and
their
round
tires
like
the
moon
the
chains
and
the
bracelets
and
the
mufflers
the
bonnets
and
the
ornaments
of
the
legs
and
the
headbands
and
the
tablets
and
the
earrings
the
rings
and
nose
jewels
the
changeable
suits
of
apparel
and
the
mantles
and
the
wimples
and
the
crisping
pins
the
glasses
and
the
fine
linen
and
the
hoods
and
the
veils
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
instead
of
sweet
smell
there
shall
be
stink
and
instead
of
a
girdle
a
rent
and
instead
of
well
set
hair
baldness
and
instead
of
a
stomacher
a
girding
of
sackcloth
and
burning
instead
of
and
at
that
moment
the
door
from
the
corridor
was
flung
open
and
mary
magna
came
in
xi
my
god
will
you
look
who
here
billy
wretched
creature
i
have
laid
eyes
on
you
for
two
months
do
you
have
to
desert
me
entirely
just
because
you
fallen
in
love
with
a
society
girl
with
the
face
of
a
japanese
what
the
matter
with
me
that
i
lose
my
lovers
faster
than
i
get
them
edgerton
rosythe
come
in
here
you
got
a
good
excuse
i
admit
i
almost
as
much
scared
of
your
wife
as
you
are
yourself
but
still
i
like
a
chance
to
get
tired
of
some
man
first
hello
planchet
how
my
old
grannie
making
out
in
your
say
would
you
think
it
would
take
three
days
labor
for
half
a
dozen
sioux
squaws
to
pull
the
skin
off
one
old
lady
back
and
a
week
to
tie
up
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
give
her
a
permanent
smile
grannie
i
said
god
it
would
be
cheaper
to
hire
charlie
chaplin
to
walk
round
in
front
of
you
all
the
rest
of
your
life
and
why
what
this
for
the
love
of
peter
somebody
introduce
me
to
this
gentleman
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
billy
carpenter
excuse
me
carpenter
but
we
picture
people
learn
to
talk
about
our
faces
and
our
styles
and
it
is
every
day
i
come
on
a
million
dollars
walking
round
on
two
legs
who
does
the
gentleman
work
for
the
storm
of
mary
magna
stopped
long
enough
for
her
to
stare
from
one
to
another
of
us
what
you
mean
nobody
got
him
and
you
all
standing
round
here
not
signing
any
contracts
you
edgerton
you
have
run
to
the
telephone
to
call
up
eternal
city
well
as
it
happens
is
going
to
be
here
in
five
minutes
his
wife
is
being
made
beautiful
once
again
somewhere
in
this
take
my
advice
carpenter
and
do
sign
today
the
price
will
go
up
several
hundred
per
week
as
long
as
you
hold
mary
stopped
again
and
this
was
most
unusual
for
as
a
general
rule
she
never
stopped
until
somebody
or
something
stopped
her
but
she
was
fascinated
by
the
spectacle
of
carpenter
my
good
god
where
did
he
come
from
why
it
seems
like
i
trying
to
think
yes
it
the
very
man
listen
billy
you
may
not
believe
it
but
i
was
in
a
church
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
i
went
to
see
roxanna
riddle
marry
that
grand
duke
fellow
it
was
in
a
big
church
over
by
the
park
bartholomew
they
call
it
i
sat
looking
at
a
stained
glass
window
over
the
altar
and
billy
i
swear
i
believe
this
carpenter
came
down
from
that
window
maybe
he
did
mary
i
put
in
but
i
not
joking
i
tell
you
he
the
living
speaking
image
of
that
figure
come
to
think
of
it
he
is
speaking
he
has
said
a
word
tell
me
carpenter
have
you
got
a
voice
or
are
you
only
a
close
up
from
servant
in
the
house
or
hur
say
something
so
i
can
get
a
line
on
you
again
i
stood
wondering
how
would
carpenter
take
this
would
he
bow
his
head
and
run
before
a
of
feminine
impertinence
would
she
vamp
him
as
she
did
every
man
who
came
near
her
or
would
this
man
do
what
no
man
alive
had
yet
been
able
to
do
reduce
her
to
silence
he
smiled
gently
and
i
saw
that
she
had
vamped
him
this
much
at
least
he
was
going
to
be
polite
mary
he
said
i
think
you
are
carrying
everything
but
the
nose
nose
jewels
what
a
horrid
idea
where
did
you
get
that
when
you
came
in
i
was
quoting
the
prophet
isaiah
some
eighty
generations
of
ladies
have
lived
on
earth
since
his
day
mary
they
have
won
the
ballot
but
apparently
they
have
discovered
anything
new
in
the
way
of
ornaments
some
of
the
prophet
words
may
be
strange
to
you
but
if
you
study
them
you
will
see
that
you
got
everything
he
lists
tinkling
ornaments
about
their
feet
and
their
cauls
and
their
round
tires
like
the
moon
the
chains
and
the
bracelets
and
the
mufflers
the
bonnets
and
the
ornaments
of
the
legs
and
the
headbands
and
the
tablets
and
the
earrings
the
rings
and
nose
jewels
the
changeable
suits
of
apparel
and
the
mantles
and
the
wimples
and
the
crisping
pins
the
glasses
and
the
fine
linen
and
the
hoods
and
the
veils
as
carpenter
recited
this
list
his
eyes
roamed
from
one
part
to
another
of
the
wondrous
get
up
of
mary
magna
you
can
imagine
her
facing
him
that
bold
and
vivid
figure
which
you
have
seen
as
cleopatra
and
salome
as
dubarry
and
anne
boleyn
and
i
know
not
how
many
other
of
the
famous
courtesans
and
queens
of
history
in
daily
life
her
style
and
manner
is
every
bit
as
staggering
she
is
a
gorgeous
brunette
and
wears
all
the
colors
there
are
when
she
goes
down
the
street
it
is
like
a
whole
procession
with
flags
wager
that
apart
from
her
jewels
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
real
she
was
carrying
not
less
than
five
thousand
dollars
worth
of
stuff
that
fall
afternoon
a
big
black
picture
hat
with
a
flower
garden
and
parts
of
an
aviary
on
top
but
what
the
use
of
going
over
isaiah
list
everything
but
the
nose
jewels
said
carpenter
and
they
may
be
in
fashion
next
how
about
the
glasses
put
in
rosythe
entering
into
the
fun
oh
shucks
said
i
protecting
my
friend
turn
out
the
contents
of
your
and
the
laughed
the
critic
has
madame
planchet
just
shown
us
those
all
this
while
mary
had
not
taken
her
eyes
off
carpenter
so
you
are
really
one
of
those
religious
fellows
she
exclaimed
know
exactly
what
to
do
without
any
directing
how
perfectly
incredible
and
at
that
appropriate
moment
pushed
open
the
door
and
waddled
in
xii
you
know
the
screen
stars
of
course
but
maybe
you
do
not
know
those
larger
celestial
bodies
the
dark
and
silent
and
invisible
stars
from
which
the
shining
ones
derive
their
energies
so
permit
me
to
introduce
you
to
the
trade
abbreviation
for
a
name
which
nobody
can
remember
which
even
his
secretaries
have
to
keep
typed
on
a
slip
of
paper
just
above
their
machine
tszchniczklefritszch
he
came
a
few
years
ago
from
ruthenia
or
rumelia
or
roumania
one
of
those
countries
where
the
consonants
are
so
greatly
in
excess
of
the
vowels
if
you
are
as
rich
as
he
you
call
him
abey
which
is
easy
otherwise
you
call
him
which
he
accepts
as
a
part
of
his
americanization
he
is
shorter
than
you
or
i
and
has
found
that
he
ca
grow
upward
but
can
grow
without
limit
in
all
lateral
directions
there
is
always
a
little
more
of
him
than
his
clothing
can
hold
and
it
spreads
out
in
rolls
about
his
collar
he
has
a
yellowish
face
which
turns
red
easily
he
has
small
shiny
eyes
he
speaks
atrocious
english
he
is
as
devoid
of
culture
as
a
hairy
ainu
and
he
smells
money
and
goes
after
it
like
a
hog
into
a
hello

magnate
and
he

out
and
the
two
caryatids
lifted
the
and
half
carried
it
to
the
elevator
and
mary
walked
with
carpenter
and
i
brought
up
the
rear
the
car
of
was
waiting
at
the
door
and
this
car
is
something
special
it
is
long
like
a
made
all
of
shining
or
some
such
material
the
huge
wheels
are
of
solid
metal
and
the
fenders
are
so
big
and
solid
it
looks
like
an
armored
military
car
there
is
an
extra
wheel
on
each
side
and
two
more
locked
on
to
the
rear
there
is
a
chauffeur
in
uniform
and
a
footman
in
uniform
just
to
open
the
doors
and
close
them
and
salute
you
as
you
enter
inside
it
is
all
like
the
sofas
in
scalping
shop
you
fall
into
them
and
soft
furs
enfold
you
and
you
give
a
sigh
of
contentment
prince
said
to
the
chauffeur
and
the
palace
on
wheels
began
to
glide
along
it
occurred
to
me
to
wonder
that
was
not
embarrassed
to
take
carpenter
to
a
fashionable
but
i
could
read
his
thoughts
everybody
would
assume
that
he
had
been
on
location
with
one
of
his
stars
and
anyhow
what
the
hell
he
abey
tszchniczklefritszch
snarled
the
horn
of
the
car
and
i
could
understand
the
meaning
of
this
also
it
said
i
am
the
car
of
abey
tszchniczklefritszch
king
of
the
movies
future
king
of
the
world
get
the
hell
out
o
my
way
so
we
sped
through
the
crowded
streets
and
pedestrians
scattered
like
autumn
leaves
before
a
storm
my
gawd
but
i
hungry
said

we
came
to
prince
and
drew
up
before
the
and
found
ourselves
confronting
an
adventure
there
was
a
crowd
before
the
place
a
surging
throng
down
the
block
with
a
whole
line
of
policemen
to
hold
them
back
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
were
transparencies
frame
boxes
with
canvas
on
and
lights
inside
and
words
painted
on
them

cried
vot
dis
suddenly
i
recalled
what
i
had
read
in
the
morning
paper
the
workers
of
the
famous
lobster
palace
had
gone
on
strike
and
trouble
was
feared
i
told
and
he
exclaimed
oh
hell
ai
we
got
troubles
enough
vit
strikers
in
de
studios
vitout
dey
come
our
dinner
the
footman
had
jumped
from
his
seat
and
had
the
door
open
and
the
great
man
began
to
alight
at
that
moment
the
mob
set
up
a
howl
for
shame
for
shame
unfair
do
go
in
there
they
starve
their
workers
they
taking
the
bread
out
of
our
mouths
scabs
scabs
i
got
out
second
and
saw
a
spectacle
of
haggard
faces
shouting
menaces
and
pleadings
i
saw
hands
waved
wildly
one
or
two
fists
clenched
i
saw
the
police
shoving
against
the
mass
poking
with
their
sticks
none
too
gently
a
poor
devil
in
a
waiter
costume
stretched
out
his
arms
to
me
yelling
in
a
foreign
dialect
you
take
de
food
from
my
babies
the
next
moment
the
club
of
a
policeman
came
down
on
his
head
crack
i
heard
mary
scream
behind
me
and
i
turned
just
in
the
nick
of
time
carpenter
was
leaping
toward
the
policeman
crying
stop
there
was
no
chance
to
parley
in
this
emergency
i
grabbed
carpenter
in
a
tackle
i
got
one
arm
pinned
to
his
side
and
mary
good
old
scout
got
the
other
as
quickly
she
is
a
bit
of
an
athlete
has
to
keep
in
training
for
those
and
things
she
does
when
she
wins
the
love
of
emperors
and
sultans
and
also
when
we
got
hold
of
carpenter
we
discovered
that
he
was
much
but
skin
and
bones
anyhow
we
fairly
lifted
him
up
and
rushed
him
into
the
restaurant
and
after
the
first
moment
he
stopped
resisting
and
let
us
lead
him
between
the
aisles
of
diners
on
the
heels
of
the
toddling
there
was
a
table
reserved
in
an
alcove
and
we
brought
him
to
it
and
then
waited
to
see
what
we
had
done
xiv
carpenter
turned
to
those
sad
but
everchanging
eyes
were
flashing
you
have
taken
a
great
liberty
there
was
any
time
to
argue
i
said

his
dark
eyes
on
me
i
observe

of
mobs
in

he
remarked
and
the

carpenter
mr

said
that
the
police
would
not
work
unless
they
were
paid
may
i
ask
who
pays
them
to
work
here
is
it
the
proprietor
of
the
restaurant
vell
cried
ai
he
got
ta
take
care
of
his
place
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
i
laughing
from
what
i
read
in
the
this
morning
i
gather
that
an
old
friend
of
has
been
paying
in
this
carpenter
looked
at
me
inquiringly
mr
algernon
de
wiggs
president
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
issued
a
statement
denouncing
the
way
the
police
were
letting
mobs
of
strikers
interfere
with
business
and
proposing
that
the
chamber
take
steps
to
stop
it
you
remember
de
wiggs
and
how
we
left
him
yes
i
remember
said
carpenter
and
we
exchanged
a
smile
over
that
trick
we
had
played
i
could
see
prick
forward
his
ears
vot
you
know
de
viggs
mr
carpenter
possesses
an
acquaintance
with
our
best
society
which
will
astonish
you
when
you
realize
vy
did
you
tell
me
dat
demanded
the
other
and
i
could
complete
the
sentence
for
him
somebody
has
offered
him
more
money
here
the
voice
of
maw
was
heard
ai
we
gon
na
git
nuttin
to
eat
so
for
a
time
the
problem
of
capital
and
labor
was
put
to
one
side
there
were
two
waiters
standing
by
very
nervous
because
of
the
strike
grabbed
the
card
from
one
and
read
off
a
list
of
food
which
the
waiter
wrote
down
maw
who
was
learning
the
rudiments
of
etiquette
handed
her
card
to
mary
who
gave
her
order
and
then
maw
gave
hers
and
i
gave
mine
and
there
was
only
carpenter
left
he
was
sitting
his
dark
eyes
roaming
here
and
there
about
the
prince
as
you
may
know
is
a
gorgeous
establishment
too
much
so
for
my
taste
it
has
almost
as
much
gilded
moulding
as
if
had
designed
it
for
a
picture
palace
in
front
of
eyes
sat
a
dame
with
a
bare
white
back
and
a
rope
of
big
pearls
about
it
and
a
tiara
of
diamonds
on
top
and
beyond
her
were
more
dames
and
yet
more
and
men
in
putting
food
into
red
faces
you
and
i
get
used
to
such
things
but
i
could
understand
that
to
a
stranger
it
must
be
shocking
to
see
so
many
people
feeding
so
expensively
vot
you
vant
to
order
carpenter
demanded
and
i
waited
full
of
curiosity
what
would
this
man
choose
to
eat
in
a
lobster
palace
carpenter
took
the
card
from
his
host
and
studied
it
apparently
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
most
substantial
part
of
the
menu
i
have
prime
ribs
of
beef
said
he
and
boiled
mutton
with
caper
sauce
and
young
spring
turkey
and
squab
en
casserole
and
milk
fed
guinea
fowl
the
waiter
of
course
was
obediently
writing
down
each
item
and
planked
steak
with
mushrooms
and
braised
spare
ribs
my
gawd

in
the
host
and
roast
teal
duck
and
lamb

so
still
it
was
the
two
waiters
nearly
dropped
their

their
napkins
they
did
drop
their
jaws
and
permanent
wave
seemed

go
flat

the
proprietor
of

city

his
perspiring
forehead
with
his
napkin
and
started
rather
hurriedly
to
make
conversation
i
understood
that

wanted
to
enjoy

eagerly
as
her
husband
there
were
five
little
growing
up
and
bringing
pressure
to
let
the
dead
past
stay
buried
in
vestminster
abbey
or
wherever
it
might
be
the
waiter
brought
the
dinner
and
spread
it
before
us
and
tucked
his
napkin
under
both
ears
and
grabbed
his
knife
in
one
hand
and
his
fork
in
the
other
and
took
a
long
breath
and
said
folks
see
you
later
and
he
went
to
work
xvi
for
five
minutes
or
so
there
was
no
sound
but
that
of
one
man
food
going
in
and
going
down
then
suddenly
the
man
stopped
with
his
knife
and
fork
upright
on
the
table
in
each
hand
and
cried
mr
carpenter
you
ai
eatin
nuttin
the
stranger
who
had
apparently
been
in
a
daydream

suddenly
back
to
prince

looked
at
the
quantities
of
food
spread
about
him
if
you
only
let
me
take
a
little
to
those
men
outside
he
said
it
pleadingly
but
tapped
imperiously
on
the
table
with
both
his
knife
and
fork
together
mr
carpenter
eat
your
dinner
eat
it
now
i
say
it
was
as
if
he
were
dealing
with
one
of
the
five
little
and
carpenter
strange
as
it
may
seem
obeyed
he
picked
up
a
bit
of
bread
and
began
to
nibble
it
and
went
to
work
again
there
was
another
five
minutes
of
silence
and
then
the
picture
magnate
stopped
with
a
look
of
horror
on
his
face
my
gawd
cryin
sure
enough
there
were
two
large
tears
trickling
one
down
each
cheek
of
the
stranger
and
dropping
on
the
bread
he
was
putting
into
his
mouth
look
here
carpenter
protested
is
it
dem
strikers
i
sorry

a
bunch
damn
lousy

abey
vot
a
vay
to
talk
at

broke
in
maw
and
then
suddenly
mary
magna
spoke
it
was
a
strange
thing
though
i
did
not
realize
it
until
afterwards
mary
the
irrepressible
had
hardly
said
one
word
since
we
left
the
beauty
parlors
mary
always
the
life
of
dinner
parties
was
sitting
like
a
woman
who
had
seen
the
ghost
of
a
dead
child
her
eyes
following
carpenter
her
mind
evidently
absorbed
in
probing
his
thoughts
abey
said
she
with
sudden
passion
of
a
sort
i
never
seen
her
display
before
forget
your
grub
for
a
moment

have
something
to
say

heart
full
of
love
for

people
while

just
trying
to
see
what

to

skull

the
great
man

wide
open

smoke
mary
vot
got
into
you
and
suddenly
he
almost
shrieked
lord
she
too
no
i
not
declared
mary
vialiantly
but
there
were
two
drops
on
her
cheeks
so
big
that
she
was
forced
to
wipe
them
away
just
a
little
shame
that
all
here
we
sit
with
three
times
as
much
food
before
us
as
we
can
eat
and
all
over
this
city

spills
his
tears
into

but
mary

abey

that

conscience
but
i
try
to
eat
so
as
not
to
be
and
grunted
and
went
back
to
his
feeding
and
the
stranger
made
a
pretense
of
eating
and
we
did
the
same
xvii
it
happens
that
i
was
brought
up
in
a
highly
conscientious
family
to
my
dear
mother
and
to
her
worthy
sisters
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
more
painful
than
what
they
call
a
scene
unless
possibly
it
is
what
they
call
a
and
here
we
had
certainly
had
a
scene
and
still
had
a
so
i
sat
racking
my
brains
to
think
of
something
safe
to
talk
about
i
recalled
that
had
had
pretty
good
success
with
his
tale
of
two
cities
as
a
topic
of
conversation
so
i
began
mr
carpenter
the
spectacle
you
are
going
to
see
this
evening
is
rather
remarkable
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
one
of
the
greatest
scenic
artists
of
paris
has
designed
the
set
and
the
best
judges
consider
it
a
real
achievement
a
landmark
in
moving
picture
tell
me
about
it
said
carpenter
and
i
was
grateful
for
his
tone
of
interest
well
i
do
know
how
much
you
know
about
picture
making
you
had
better
explain
well
has
built
a
large
set
representing
a
street
scene
in
paris
over
a
century
ago
he
has
hired
a
thousand
men
two
tousand
broke
in
in
the
advertisements
i
suggested
with
a
smile
no
no
insisted
the
other
two
tousand
really
in
de
advertisements
five
well
said
i
these
men
wear
costumes
which
has
had
made
for
them
and
they
pretend
to
be
a
mob
they
have
been
practicing
all
day
and
by
now
they
know
what
to
do
there
is
a
man
with
a
megaphone
shouting
orders
to
them
and
enormous
lights
playing
upon
them
so
that
men
with
cameras
can
take
pictures
of
the
scene
it
is
very
vivid
and
as
a
portrayal
of
history
is
truly
and
when
it
is
done
what
becomes
of
the
men
utterly
hopeless
you
see
we
were
right
back
on
the
forbidden
ground
how
do
you
mean
i
evaded
i
mean
how
do
they
live
dey
got
deir
five
dollars
ai
dey
it
was
of
course
yes
but
that
won
last
very
long
will
it
what
is
the
cost
of
this
dinner
we
are
eating
the
magnate
of
the
movies
looked
to
the
speaker
and
then
burst
into
a
laugh
ho
ho
ho
dat
a
good
vun
said
i
hastily
mr
means
that
there
are
cheaper
eating
places
to
be
well
said
carpenter
why
do
we
find
one
it
no
use
billy
he
thinks
it
up
to
me
to
feed
all
de
bums
on
de
lot

said
carpenter
what
difference
would

make
the
proprietor
of
eternal
city

wanted
to
make
out
the
processes
of
this
abnormal
mind
he
wrinkled
his
brows
and

very
hard

called
lions
and
she
been
watching
carpenter
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
ever
since
he
came
into
the
room
trying
to
figure
out
whether
he
a
lion
or
only
an
actor
if
his
skin
were
a
bit
dark
she
would
be
sure
he
was
an
eastern
potentate
as
it
she
afraid
he
of
domestic
origin
in
which
case
he
vulgar
the
company
he
keeps
is
against
him
but
still
stebbins
has
had
my
eye
three
times
hoping
i
would
give
her
a
signal
i
have
given
it
so
she
about
to
vell
she
can
go
to
hell
said
keeping
his
promise
to
devote
himself
to
his
dinner
i
offered
parmelee
stebbins
a
tird
share
in
pride
o
passion
fer
a
hunded
tousand
dollars
and
de
damn
fool
turned
me
down
and
de
picture

made
a
million
and
a
quarter

said
i
he
probably
paying
for
it
by
sitting
up
late
to
buy
the
city
council
on
this
new
franchise
grab
of
his
and
so
he
has
kept
his
date
to

his
expensive
family

miss
lucinda
stebbins
she
engaged

rocky
mountains
tonight
and
so
lucinda
feels
bored
and
she
knows
the
vaudeville
show
is
going
to
be
tiresome
but
still
she
does
want
to
meet
any
freaks
she
has
just
said
to
her
mother
that
she
ca
see
why
a
person
in
her
mother
position
ca
be
content
to
meet
proper
people
but
always
has
to
be
getting
herself
into
the
newspapers
with
some
new
sort
of
my
gawd
billy
cried
maw
you
got
a
dictaphone
on
dem
people
no
but
i
know
the
type
so
well
i
can
tell
by
their
looks
lucinda
is
thinking
about
their
big
new
palace
on
grand
avenue
and
she
regards
everyone
outside
her
set
as
a
burglar
trying
to
break
in
and
then
there
bertie
stebbins
who
thinking
about
a
new
style
of
collar
he
saw
advertised
and
how
it
would
look
on
him
and
what
impression
it
would
make
on
his
newest
it
was
mary
who
spoke
now
i
know
that
little
toad
i
seen
him
dancing
at
the
palace
with
dorothy
doodles
or
whatever
her
name
well
said
i
mrs
stebbins
runs
the
newer
set
those
who
hunt
sensations
and
make
a
splurge
in
the
papers
it
costs
like
smoke
of
course
and
suddenly
i
stopped
look
out
i
whispered
here
she
comes
xviii
i
heard
maw
catch
her
breath
and
i
heard
maw
husband
give
a
grunt
then
i
rose
how
are
you
billy
gurgled
a
voice
one
of
those
voices
made
especially
for
social
occasions
wretched
boy
why
do
you
never
come
to
see
us
i
was
coming
i
said
for
who
could
prove
otherwise
mrs
stebbins
permit
me
to
introduce
charmed
to
meet
you
i
sure
said
stebbins
i
heard
my
husband
speak
of
your
husband
so
often
how
well
you
are
looking
she
stopped
and
maw
knowing
the
terrors
of
her
name
made
haste
to
say
something
agreeable
yes
dis
country
agrees
vit
me
fine
since
i
come
here
i
rode
and
et
shoost
rode
and
and
said
i
howdydo
pretty
good
said
he
had
been
caught
with
his
mouth
full
and
was
making
desperate
efforts
to
swallow
a
singular
thing
is
the
power
of
class
prestige
here
was
maw
a
good
woman
according
to
her
lights
who
had
worked
hard
all
her
life
and
had
achieved
a
colossal
and
astounding
success
she
had
everything
in
the
world
that
money
could
buy
her
hair
was
done
by
the
best
her
gown
had
been
designed
by
the
best
costumer
her
rings
and
bracelets
selected
by
the
best
jeweller
and
yet
nothing
was
right
no
power
on
earth
could
make
it
right
and
maw
knew
it
and
writhed
the
consciousness
of
it
and
here
was
parmelee
stebbins
who
had
never
done
a
useful
thing
in
all
her
days
except
you
count
the
picking
out
of
a
rich
husband
yet
stebbins
was
right
and
maw
knew
it
and
in
the
presence
of
the
other
woman
she
was
in
an
utter
panic
literally
quivering
in
every
nerve
and
here
was
old
who
left
to
himself
might
have
really
meant
what
he
said
that
stebbins
could
go
to
hell
but
because
he
was
married
and
loved
his
wife
he
too
trembled
and
gulped
down
his
food
stebbins
is
one
of
those
american
matrons
who
do
not
allow
marriage
and
motherhood
to
make
vulgar
physical
impressions
upon
them
her
pale
blue
gown
might
have
been
worn
by
her
daughter
her
cool
grey
eyes
looked
out
through
a
face
without
a
wrinkle
from
a
soul
without
a
care
she
was
a
patroness
of
art
and
intellect
but
never
did
she
forget
her
fundamental
duty
the
enhancing
of
the
prestige
of
a
family
name
when
she
was
introduced
to
a
she
was
gracious
but
did
not
forget
the
difference
between
an
actress
and
a
lady
when
she
was
introduced
to
a
strange
man
who
did
not
wear
trousers
she
took
it
quite
as
an
everyday
matter
revealing
no
trace
of
vulgar
human
curiosity
there
came
bertie
full
grown
but
not
yet
out
of
the
pimply
stage
and
still
conscious
of
the
clothes
which
he
had
taken
such
pains
to
get
right
bertie
sister
remained
in
her
seat
refusing
naughtily
to
be
compromised
by
her
mother
vagaries
but
bertie
had
a
purpose
and
after
i
had
introduced
him
round
i
saw
what
he
wanted
mary
magna
bertie
had
a
vision
of
himself
as
a
sort
of
sporting
prince
in
this
movie
world
his
social
position
would
make
conquests
easy
it
was
a
sort
of
all
with
prizes
i
was
standing
near
and
heard
the
beginning
of
their
conversation
oh
miss
magna
i
so
pleased
to
meet
you
i
heard
so
much
about
you
from
miss
miss
dulles
yes
dorothy
i
sorry
i
do
think
i
ever
heard
of
what
dorothy
dulles
the
screen
actress
no
i
ca
place
but
but
she
a
star
well
but
you
know
stebbins
there
are
so
many
stars
in
the
heavens
and
not
all
of
them
visible
to
the
i
turned
to
bertie
mamma
she
had
discovered
that
carpenter
looked
even
more
thrilling
on
a
close
view
he
was
not
a
stage
figure
but
a
really
grave
and
impressive
personality
exactly
the
thing
to
thrill
the
ladies
of
the
higher
arts
club
at
their
monthly
luncheon
and
to
reflect
prestige
upon
his
discoverer
so
here
she
was
inviting
the
party
to
share
her
box
at
the
theatre
and
here
was
explaining
that
it
could
be
done
he
had
got
to
see
his
french
revolution
pictures
took
dey
had
five
tousand
men
hired
to
make
a
mob
i
noted
that
stebbins
received
the
advertising
figures
on
the
production
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
the
great
lady
consented
to
forget
her
box
at
the
theatre
and
run
out
to
the
studios
to
see
the
mob
scenes
for
the
the
tale
of
two
had
quite
finished
his
dinner
but
he
waved
his
hand
and
said
it
was
nuttin
he
vould
keep
stebbins
vaitin
he
beckoned
the
waiter
and
signed
his
magic
name
on
the
check
with
a
bill
on
top
for
a
tip
stebbins
collected
her
family
and
floated
to
the
door
and
our
party
followed
i
expected
another
scene
with
the
mob
but
i
found
that
the
street
had
been
swept
clear
of
everything
but
policemen
and
chauffeurs
i
knew
that
this
must
have
meant
rough
work
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
but
i
said
nothing
and
hoped
that
carpenter
would
not
think
of
it
the
stebbins
car
drew
up
by
the
and
suddenly
i
discovered
why
the
wife
of
the
magnate
was
known
as
a
social
billy
she
said
you
come
in
our
car
and
bring
carpenter
i
have
something
to
talk
to
you
just
that
easily
you
see
she
wanted
something
so
she
asked
for
it
i
took
carpenter
by
the
arm
and
put
him
in
bertie
drove
the
chauffeur
sitting
in
the
seat
beside
him
beat
you
to
it
called
bertie
with
his
invincible
arrogance
and
waved
his
hand
to
the
picture
magnate
as
we
rolled
away
xix
as
it
happened
we
made
a
poor
start
turning
the
corner
into
broadway
we
found
ourselves
caught
in
the
jam
of
the
theatre
traffic
and
our
car
was
brought
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
empire
if
you
have
been
on
any
broadway
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
you
can
imagine
the
sight
the
flaring
electric
signs
the
pictures
of
the
head
line
artists
the
people
waiting
to
buy
tickets
and
the
crowds
on
the
sidewalk
pushing
past
there
was
one
additional
feature
a
crowd
of
boys
with
yellow
and
purple
flags
in
their
hands
and
the
glory
of
battle
in
their
eyes
as
our
car
halted
the
gave
a
signal
and
a
hundred
throats
let
out
in
unison
rickety
zim
rickety
zam
brickety

slam
wallybaloo
billybazoo
we
are
the
boys
for
a
hullabaloo
western
city
it
sounded
all
the
more
deafening
because
bertie
in
the
front
seat
had
joined
in
hello
said
i
we
must
have
won
the
you
we
did
said
bertie
in
his
voice
of
bursting
asked
carpenter
said
i
western

union

today
wonder
what
the
score
the

seemed
to
take
the
words
out
of

was
the
score

who

western

you
have
heard
college
yells
no
doubt
and
can
imagine
the
tempo
of
these
cries
the
cumulative
rush
of
the
spelled
out
letters
the
booming
roar
at
the
end
the
voice
of
bertie
beat
back
from
the
with
devastating
effect
upon
our
ears
and
then
our
car
rolled
on
and
the
clamor
died
away
and
i
answered
the
questions
of
carpenter
they
are
college
boys
they
have
won
a
game
with
another
college
and
are
celebrating
the
but
said
the
other
how
do
they
manage
to
shout
all
together
that
way
oh
they
practiced
that
of
you
mean
they
gather
and
practice
making
those
noises
they
make
them
in
cold
blood
i
laughed
well
the
blood
of
youth
is
seldom
entirely
cold
they
imagine
the
victory
while
they
rehearse
no
when
carpenter
spoke
again
it
was
half
to
himself
you
make
your
children
into
mobs
you
train
them
for
it
it
really
is
that
bad
i
replied
it
all
in
good
temper
it
their
yes
yes
but
what
is
play
but
practice
for
reality
and
how
shall
love
be
learned
in
savage
they
tell
us
that
we
have
a
new
generation
of
young
people
since
the
war
a
generation
which
thinks
for
itself
and
has
its
own
way
i
was
an
advocate
of
this
idea
in
the
abstract
but
i
must
admit
that
i
was
startled
by
the
concrete
case
which
i
now
encountered
bertie
suddenly
looked
round
from
his
place
in
the
driver
seat
say
he
demanded
in
a
grating
voice
where
was
that
guy
raised
bertie
cried
his
mother
do
be
rude
i
not
being
rude
replied
the
other
i
just
want
to
know
where
he
got
his
nut
bertie
cried
the
mother
again
and
you
knew
that
for
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
she
had
been
crying
bertie
in
a
tone
in
which
rebuke
was
tempered
by
fatuous
maternal
admiration
and
all
the
time
bertie
had
gone
on
doing
what
he
pleased
knowing
that
in
her
secret
heart
his
mother
was
smiling
with
admiration
of
his
masterfulness
taking
it
as
one
more
symptom
of
the
greatness
of
the
stebbins
line
i
could
see
him
in
early
childhood
stamping
on
the
floor
and
commanding
his
governess
to
bring
him
a
handkerchief
and
throwing
his
shoe
at
her
when
she
delayed
presently
it
was
lucinda
turn
lucinda
you
understand
was
in
revolt
against
the
social
indignity
which
her
mother
had
inflicted
upon
her
when
carpenter
had
entered
the
car
she
had
looked
at
him
once
with
a
deliberate
stare
then
lifted
her
chin
ignoring
my
effort
to
introduce
him
to
her
since
then
she
had
sat
silent
cold
and
proud
but
now
she
spoke
mother
tell
me
do
we
have
to
meet
those
horrid
fat
old
jews
again
stebbins
wisely
decided
that
this
was
not
a
good
time
to
explore
the
soul
of
a
possible
eastern
potentate
instead
she
elected
to
talk
for
a
minute
or
two
about
a
lawn
fete
she
was
planning
to
give
next
week
for
the
benefit
of
the
polish
relief
poland
is
the
world
bulwark
against
bolshevism
she
explained
and
then
added
bertie
are
you
driving
recklessly
bertie
turned
his
head
did
you
hear
me
tell
that
old
sheeny
i
was
going
to
beat
him
to
it
but
bertie
this
street
is
crowded
well
let
them
look
out
for
themselves
but
a
few
seconds
later
it
appeared
as
if
the
son
and
heir
of
the
stebbins
family
had
decided
to
take
his
mother
advice
the
car
suddenly
slowed
up
so
suddenly
as
to
slide
us
out
of
our
seats
there
was
a
grinding
of
brakes
and
a
bump
of
something
under
the
wheels
then
a
wild
stream
from
the
sidewalk
and
a
cry
from
the
chauffeur
stebbins
gasped
oh
my
god
and
put
her
hands
over
her
face
and
lucinda
exclaimed
in
outraged
irritation
mamma
carpenter
looked
at
me
puzzled
and
asked
what
is
the
matter
xx
the
accident
had
happened
in
an
neighborhood
one
of
those
crowded
slum
quarters
swarming
with
mexicans
and
italians
and
other
foreigners
of
course
that
was
the
only
neighborhood
in
which
it
could
have
happened
because
it
is
only
there
that
children
run
wild
in
the
streets
at
night
there
was
one
child
under
the
front
wheels
crushed
almost
in
half
so
that
you
could
not
bear
to
look
at
it
to
say
nothing
of
touching
it
and
there
was
another
struck
by
the
fender
and
knocked
into
the
gutter
there
was
an
old
hag
of
a
woman
standing
by
with
her
hands
lifted
into
the
air
shrieking
in
such
a
voice
of
mingled
terror
and
fury
as
i
had
never
heard
in
my
life
before
it
roused
the
whole
quarter
there
were
people
running
out
of
twenty
houses
i
think
before
one
of
us
could
get
out
of
the
car
the
first
person
out
was
carpenter
he
took
one
glance
at
the
form
under
the
car
and
saw
there
was
no
hope
there
then
he
ran
to
the
child
in
the
gutter
and
caught
it
into
his
arms
the
poor
people
who
rushed
to
the
scene
found
him
sitting
on
the
curb
gazing
into
the
pitiful
quivering
little
face
and
whispering
words
there
was
a
near
so
he
could
see
the
face
of
the
child
and
the
crowd
could
see
him
there
came
a
woman
apparently
the
mother
of
the
dead
child
she
saw
the
form
under
the
car
and
gave
a
horrified
scream
and
fell
into
a
faint
there
came
a
man
the
father
no
doubt
and
other
relatives
there
was
a
clamoring
frantic
throng
swarming
about
the
car
and
about
the
victims
i
went
to
carpenter
and
asked
is
it
dead
he
answered
it
will
live
i
then
seeing
that
the
crowd
was
likely
to
stifle
the
little
one
he
rose
where
does
this
child
live
he
asked
and
some
one
pointed
out
the
house
and
he
carried
his
burden
into
it
i
followed
him
and
it
was
fortunate
that
i
did
so
because
of
the
part
i
was
able
to
play
i
saw
him
lay
the
child
upon
a
couch
and
put
his
hands
upon
its
forehead
and
close
his
eyes
apparently
in
prayer
then
noting
the
clamor
outside
growing
louder
i
went
to
the
door
and
looked
out
and
found
the
stebbins
family
in
a
frightful
predicament
the
mob
had
dragged
bertie
and
the
chauffeur
outside
the
car
and
were
yelling
menaces
and
imprecations
into
their
faces
poor
bertie
was
shouting
back
that
it
was
his
fault
how
could
help
it
but
they
thought
he
might
have
helped
coming
into
their
quarter
with
his
big
rich
car
why
could
he
stay
in
his
own
part
of
the
city
and
kill
the
children
of
the
rich
a
man
hit
him
a
blow
in
the
face
and
knocked
him
over
his
mother
shrieked
and
leaped
out
to
help
him
and
half
a
dozen
women
flung
themselves
at
her
and
as
many
men
at
the
chauffeur
there
was
a
pile
of
bricks
lying
handy
and
no
doubt
also
knives
in
the
pockets
of
these
foreign
men
i
believe
the
little
party
would
have
been
torn
to
pieces
had
it
not
occurred
to
me
to
run
into
the
house
and
summon
carpenter
why
did
i
do
it
i
think
because
i
had
seen
how
the
crowd
gave
way
before
him
with
the
child
in
his
arms
anyhow
i
knew
that
i
could
do
nothing
alone
and
before
i
could
find
a
policeman
it
might
be
many
times
too
late
i
told
carpenter
what
was
happening
and
he
rose
and
ran
out
to
the
street
it
was
like
magic
of
course
to
these
poor
foreigners
catholics
most
of
them
he
did
not
suggest
a
moving
picture
actor
on
location
he
suggested
something
serious
and
miraculous
he
called
to
the
crowd
stretching
out
his
arms
and
they
gave
way
before
him
and
he
walked
into
them
and
when
he
got
to
the
struggling
group
he
held
his
arms
over
them
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
except
of
course
that
he
made
them
a
speech
seeing
that
he
was
saving
bertie
stebbins
life
it
was
no
more
than
fair
that
he
should
have
his
own
way
and
that
a
member
of
the
younger
generation
should
listen
in
unprotesting
silence
to
a
discourse
the
political
and
sociological
implications
of
which
must
have
been
very
offensive
to
him
and
bertie
listened
i
think
he
would
not
have
made
a
sound
even
if
he
could
have
after
the
crack
in
the
face
he
had
got
my
people
said
carpenter
what
good
would
it
do
you
to
kill
these
wretches
the
who
drain
the
life
of
the
poor
are
not
to
be
killed
by
blows
there
are
too
many
of
them
and
more
of
them
grow
in
place
of
those
who
die
and
what
is
worse
if
you
kill
them
you
destroy
in
yourselves
that
which
makes
you
better
than
they
which
gives
you
the
right
to
life
you
destroy
those
virtues
of
patience
and
charity
which
are
the
jewels
of
the
poor
and
make
them
princes
in
the
kingdom
of
love
let
us
guard
our
crown
of
pity
and
not
acquire
the
vices
of
our
oppressors
let
us
grow
in
wisdom
and
find
ways
to
put
an
end
to
the
world
enslavement
without
the
degradation
of
our
own
hearts
for
so
many
ages
we
have
been
patient
let
us
wait
but
a
little
longer
and
find
the
true
way
oh
my
people
my
beloved
poor
not
in
violence
but
in
solidarity
in
brotherhood
lies
the
way
let
us
bid
the
rich
go
on
to
the
sure
damnation
which
awaits
them
let
us
not
soil
our
hands
with
their
blood
he
spread
out
his
arms
again
majestically
stand
back
make
way
for
them
not
all
the
crowd
understood
the
words
but
enough
of
them
did
and
set
the
example
in
dead
silence
they
withdrew
from
the
sides
and
front
of
the
car
the
body
of
the
dead
child
had
been
dragged
out
of
the
way
and
laid
on
the
sidewalk
covered
by
a
coat
and
so
carpenter
said
to
the
stebbins
family
the
road
is
clear
before
you
step
half
dazed
the
four
people
obeyed
and
again
carpenter
raised
his
voice
drinkers
of
human
blood
devourers
of
human
bodies
go
your
way
go
forward
to
that
doom
which
history
prepares
for
parasites
the
engine
began
to
purr
and
the
car
began
to
move
there
was
a
low
mutter
from
the
crowd
a
moan
of
fury
and
baffled
desire
but
not
a
hand
was
lifted
and
the
car
shot
away
and
disappeared
down
the
street
leaving
carpenter
standing
on
the
curb
making
a
socialist
speech
to
a
mob
of
greasers
and
dagoes
xxi
when
he
stopped
speaking
it
was
because
a
woman
pressed
her
way
through
the
crowd
and
caught
one
of
his
hands
master
my
baby
she
sobbed
the
little
one
that
was
hurt
so
carpenter
said
to
the
crowd
the
sick
child
needs
me
i
must
go
they
started
to
press
after
him
and
he
added
you
must
not
come
into
the
room
the
child
will
need
he
went
inside
and
knelt
once
more
by
the
couch
and
put
his
hand
on
the
little
one
forehead
the
mother
a
frail
dark
mexican
woman
crouched
at
the
foot
not
daring
to
touch
either
the
man
or
the
child
but
staring
from
one
to
the
other
pressing
her
hands
together
in
an
agony
of
dread
the
little
one
opened
his
eyes
and
gazed
up
evidently
he
liked
what
he
saw
for
he
kept
on
gazing
and
a
smile
spread
over
his
features
a
wistful
and
tender
and
infinitely
sad
little
smile
of
a
child
who
perhaps
never
had
a
good
meal
in
his
lifetime
nice
man
he
whispered
and
the
woman
hearing
his
voice
again
began
sobbing
wildly
and
caught
carpenter
free
hand
and
covered
it
with
her
tears
it
is
all
right
said
he
all
right
all
right
he
will
get
well
do
not
be
he
smiled
back
at
the
child
saying
it
is
better
now
you
will
not
have
so
much
to
me
he
remarked
what
is
there
so
lovely
as
a
child
the
people
thronging
the
doorway
spread
word
what
was
going
on
and
there
were
shouts
of
excitement
and
presently
the
voice
of
a
woman
clamoring
for
admission
the
throng
made
way
and
she
brought
a
bundle
in
her
arms
which
being
unfolded
proved
to
contain
a
sick
baby
i
never
knew
what
was
the
matter
with
it
i
do
suppose
the
mother
knew
nor
did
carpenter
seem
to
care
the
woman
knelt
at
his
feet
praying
to
him
but
he
bade
her
stand
up
and
took
the
child
from
her
and
looked
into
its
face
and
then
closed
his
eyes
in
prayer
when
he
handed
back
the
burden
a
few
minutes
later
she
gazed
at
it
something
had
happened
or
at
least
she
thought
it
had
happened
for
she
gave
a
cry
of
joy
and
fell
at
carpenter
feet
again
and
caught
the
hem
of
his
garment
with
one
hand
and
began
to
kiss
it
the
rumor
spread
outside
and
there
were
more
people
clamoring
before
long
filtering
into
the
room
came
the
lame
and
the
halt
and
the
blind
i
had
been
reading
not
long
ago
of
the
miracles
of
lourdes
so
i
knew
in
a
general
way
what
to
expect
i
know
that
modern
science
vindicates
these
things
demonstrating
that
any
powerful
stimulus
given
to
the
unconscious
can
awaken
new
vital
impulses
and
heal
not
merely
the
hysterical
and
neurotic
but
sometimes
actual
physical
ailments
of
course
to
these
ignorant
mexicans
and
italians
there
was
no
possible
excitement
so
great
as
that
caused
by
appearance
and
behavior
i
understood
the
thing
clearly
and
yet
somehow
i
could
not
watch
it
without
being
startled
thrilled
in
a
strange
uncomfortable
way
and
later
on
i
had
company
in
these
unaccustomed
emotions
the
crowd
gave
way
and
who
should
come
into
the
room
but
mary
magna
she
did
not
speak
to
either
of
us
but
slipped
to
one
side
and
stood
in
silence
while
the
crowd
watched
her
furtively
out
of
the
corner
of
its
eyes
thinking
her
some
foreign
princess
with
her
bold
dark
beauty
and
her
costly
attire
i
went
over
to
her
whispering
how
did
you
get
here
she
explained
that
when
we
did
not
arrive
at
the
studios
she
had
called
up
the
stebbins
home
and
learned
about
the
accident
they
warned
me
not
to
come
here
because
this
man
was
a
terrible
bolshevik
he
made
a
speech
to
the
mob
what
did
he
say
i
started
to
tell
but
i
was
interrupted
by
a
piercing
shriek
a
sick
and
emaciated
young
girl
with
paralyzed
limbs
had
been
carried
into
the
room
they
had
laid
her
on
the
couch
from
which
the
child
had
been
taken
away
and
carpenter
had
put
his
hands
upon
her
at
once
the
girl
had
risen
up
and
here
she
stood
her
hands
flung
into
the
air
literally
screaming
her
triumphant
joy
of
course
the
crowd
took
it
up
these
primitive
people
are
always
glad
of
a
chance
to
make
a
big
noise
so
the
whole
room
was
in
a
clamor
and
carpenter
had
hard
work
to
extract
himself
from
the
throng
which
wished
to
touch
his
hands
and
his
clothing
and
to
worship
him
on
their
knees
he
came
over
to
us
and
smiled
is
not
this
better
than
acting
mary
yes
surely
if
one
can
do
said
he
everyone
could
do
it
if
they
is
that
really
true
she
asked
with
passionate
earnestness
there
is
a
god
in
every
man
and
in
every
why
do
they
know
it
then
there
is
a
god
and
also
a
beast
the
beast
is
old
and
familiar
and
powerful
the
god
is
new
and
strange
and
afraid
because
of
his
fear
the
beast
kills
what
is
the
beast
his
name
is
self
and
he
has
many
forms
in
men
he
is
greed
in
women
he
is
vanity
and
goes
attired
in
much
raiment
the
chains
and
the
bracelets
and
the
mufflers
oh
do
cried
mary
wildly
very
well
mary
i
and
he
did
but
looking
at
mary
it
seemed
that
she
was
just
as
unhappy
as
if
he
had
he
turned
to
an
old
man
who
had
hobbled
into
the
room
on
crutches
poor
old
comrade
poor
old
friend
his
voice
seemed
to
break
with
pity
they
have
worked
you
like
an
old
mule
until
your
skin
is
cracked
and
your
joints
grown
hard
but
they
have
not
been
so
kind
to
you
as
to
an
old
mule
they
have
left
you
to
suffer
to
a
pale
young
woman
who
staggered
towards
him
coughing
he
cried
what
can
i
do
for
you
they
are
starving
you
to
death
you
need
food
and
i
have
no
food
to
give
he
raised
his
arms
in
sudden
wrath
bring
forth
the
masters
of
this
city
who
starve
the
poor
while
they
themselves
riot
in
wantonness
but
the
members
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
of
the
association
of
western
city
were
not
within
hearing
nor
are
their
numbers
as
a
rule
to
be
found
in
the
telephone
book
carpenter
looked
about
the
place
now
lined
pretty
well
with
cripples
and
invalids
only
a
couple
of
hours
of
spreading
rumor
had
been
needed
to
bring
them
forth
unholy
and
dreadful
secrets
dragged
from
the
dark
corners
and
back
of
these
tenements
he
gazed
from
one
crooked
and
distorted
face
to
another
and
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
with
a
gesture
of
despair
no
no
he
said
it
is
of
no
use
he
lifted
his
voice
calling
once
more
to
the
masters
of
the
city
you
make
them
faster
than
i
can
heal
them
you
make
them
by
machinery
and
he
who
would
help
them
must
break
the
machine
he
turned
to
me
and
i
was
startled
for
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
inside
my
mind
i
know
it
will
not
be
easy
but
remember
i
broke
the
empire
of
rome
that
was
his
last
flare
i
can
do
no
more
he
whispered
my
power
is
gone
from
me
i
must
and
his
voice
gave
way
i
beg
you
to
go
unhappy
poor
of
the
world
i
have
done
all
that
i
can
do
for
you
and
silently
patiently
as
creatures
accustomed
to
the
voice
of
doom
the
sick
and
the
crippled
began
to
hobble
and
crawl
from
the
room
xxii
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
couch
gazing
into
space
lost
in
tragic
thought
and
mary
and
i
sat
watching
him
not
quite
certain
whether
we
ought
to
withdraw
with
the
rest
but
he
did
not
seem
aware
of
our
presence
so
we
stayed
in
our
world
it
is
not
considered
permissible
for
people
to
remain
in
company
without
talking
if
the
talk
lags
we
have
to
cast
hurriedly
about
in
our
minds
for
something
to
say
it
is
called
making
but
carpenter
evidently
did
not
know
about
this
custom
and
neither
of
us
instructed
him
once
or
twice
i
stole
a
glance
at
mary
marvelling
at
her
all
her
life
she
had
been
a
conversational
volcano
in
a
state
of
perpetual
eruption
but
now
apparently
she
passed
judgment
on
her
own
remarks
and
found
them
not
worth
making
in
the
doorway
of
the
room
appeared
the
little
boy
who
had
been
knocked
down
by
the
car
he
looked
at
carpenter
and
then
came
towards
him
when
carpenter
saw
him
a
smile
of
welcome
came
upon
his
face
he
stretched
out
an
arm
and
the
little
fellow
nestled
in
it
other
children
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
soon
he
had
a
group
about
him
sitting
on
his
knees
and
on
the
couch
they
were
little
but
he
seemingly
was
interested
in
knowing
their
names
and
their
relationships
what
they
learned
in
school
and
what
games
they
played
i
think
he
had
bertie
crowd
in
mind
for
he
said
some
day
they
will
teach
you
games
of
love
and
friendship
instead
of
rivalry
and
presently
the
mother
of
the
household
appeared
she
was
distressed
because
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
a
great
man
should
be
interested
in
the
prattle
of
children
when
he
had
people
like
us
evidently
rich
people
to
talk
to
you
will
bother
the
master
she
said
in
spanish
he
seemed
to
understand
and
answered
let
the
children
stay
with
me
they
teach
me
that
the
world
might
be
so
the
prattle
went
on
and
the
woman
stood
in
the
doorway
with
other
women
behind
her
all
beaming
with
delight
they
had
known
all
their
lives
there
was
something
especially
remarkable
about
these
children
and
here
was
their
pride
confirmed
when
the
little
ones
laughed
and
the
stranger
laughed
with
them
you
should
have
seen
the
pleasure
shining
from
a
doorway
full
of
dusky
mexican
faces
but
after
a
while
one
of
the
children
began
to
rub
his
eyes
and
the
mother
exclaimed
it
was
so
late
the
children
had
stayed
awake
because
of
the
excitement
but
now
they
must
go
to
bed
she
bundled
them
out
of
the
room
and
presently
came
back
bearing
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
plate
with
bread
and
an
orange
on
it
the
master
might
be
hungry
she
said
with
a
humble
little
bow
in
her
halting
english
she
offered
to
bring
something
to
us
but
she
did
not
suppose
we
would
care
for
poor
people
food
she
took
it
for
granted
that
poor
people
food
was
what
carpenter
would
want
and
apparently
she
was
right
for
he
ate
it
with
relish
meantime
he
tried
to
get
the
woman
to
sit
on
the
couch
beside
him
but
she
would
not
sit
in
his
presence
or
was
it
in
the
presence
of
mary
and
me
i
had
a
feeling
as
she
withdrew
that
she
might
have
been
glad
to
chat
with
him
if
a
movie
queen
and
a
spoiled
young
club
man
had
not
been
there
to
claim
prior
rights
xxiii
so
presently
we
three
were
alone
once
more
and
mary
gazing
intently
with
those
big
dark
eyes
that
the
public
knows
so
well
opened
up
tell
me
carpenter
have
you
ever
been
in
love
i
was
startled
but
if
carpenter
was
he
gave
no
sign
mary
he
said
i
have
been
in
then
thinking
perhaps
that
he
had
been
abrupt
he
added
you
mary
you
have
been
in
love
she
answered
i
not
sure
if
i
said
anything
out
loud
but
my
thought
was
easy
to
read
and
she
turned
upon
me
you
do
know
what
love
is
but
a
woman
knows
even
though
she
does
act
well
of
course
i
replied
if
you
want
to
go
into
metaphysics
metaphysics
be
damned
said
mary
and
turned
again
to
carpenter
said
he
a
good
woman
like
you
cried
mary
and
she
laughed
a
wild
laugh
do
hit
me
when
you
got
me
down
i
sold
myself
for
every
job
i
ever
got
i
sold
myself
for
every
jewel
you
saw
on
me
this
afternoon
you
notice
i
got
them
off
now
i
do
understand
mary
he
said
gently
why
does
a
woman
like
you
sell
herself
what
else
has
she
got
i
was
a
rat
in
a
tenement
i
could
have
been
a
drudge
but
i
was
made
for
that
i
sold
myself
for
a
job
in
a
store
and
then
for
ribbons
to
be
pretty
and
then
for
a
place
in
the
chorus
and
then
for
a
speaking
part
so
on
all
the
way
now
i
portray
other
women
selling
themselves
they
get
fancy
prices
and
so
do
i
and
that
makes
me
a
i
hope
you
never
see
my
i
sat
watching
this
scene
marvelling
more
than
ever
that
tone
in
mary
magna
voice
was
a
new
one
to
me
perhaps
she
had
not
used
it
since
she
played
her
last
speaking
part
i
thought
to
myself
there
was
a
crisis
impending
in
the
screen
industry
said
carpenter
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
mary
what
can
i
do
my
contract
has
seven
years
to
could
you
do
something
honest
i
mean
could
you
tell
an
honest
story
in
your
pictures
me
my
god
tell
that
to
and
watch
his
face
why
they
hunt
all
the
world
over
for
some
new
kind
of
clothes
for
me
to
take
off
they
search
all
history
for
some
war
i
can
cause
some
empire
i
can
wreck
me
play
an
honest
woman
the
public
would
call
it
a
joke
and
the
screen
people
would
call
it
carpenter
got
up
and
began
to
pace
the
room
mary
said
he
i
once
lived
under
the
roman
empire
yes
i
know
i
was
cleopatra
and
again
i
was
nero
mistress
while
he
watched
the
city
rome
was
rough
and
crude
and
poor
mary
rome
was
nothing
to
this
this
is
satan
on
my
father
throne
making
new
worlds
for
he
paced
the
room
again
then
turned
and
said
i
understand
this
world
i
must
know
more
about
it
if
i
am
to
save
it
there
was
such
grief
such
selfless
pity
in
his
voice
as
he
repeated
this
i
must
know
more
you
know
everything
exclaimed
mary
suddenly
you
are
all
wisdom
but
he
went
on
speaking
as
if
to
himself
pondering
his
problem
to
serve
others
yet
not
to
indulge
them
for
the
cause
of
their
enslavment
is
that
they
have
accepted
service
without
return
and
how
shall
one
preach
patience
to
the
poor
when
the
masters
make
such
preaching
a
new
means
of
enslavement
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
thought
that
i
could
answer
his
question
then
with
sudden
energy
he
exclaimed
i
must
meet
those
who
are
in
rebellion
against
enslavement
tomorrow
i
want
to
meet
the
strikers
all
the
strikers
in
your
you
have
your
hands
full
i
said
for
i
was
a
coward
and
wanted
to
keep
him
out
of
it
how
shall
i
find
them
he
persisted
i
do
know
i
suppose
their
headquarters
are
at
the
labor
i
will
go
there
meantime
i
fear
i
shall
have
to
be
alone
i
need
to
think
about
the
things
i
have
where
are
you
going
to
stay
i
do
said
mary
hesitatingly
my
car
is
outside
he
answered
in
ancient
days
i
saw
the
young
patricians
drive
through
the
streets
in
their
chariots
no
i
shall
not
ride
with
them
said
i
i
have
an
apartment
at
the
club
with
plenty
of
room
no
no
friend
i
have
seen
enough
of
the
masters
of
this
city
from
now
on
if
you
want
to
see
me
you
will
find
me
among
the
if
i
may
meet
you
in
the
morning
i
said
to
show
you
to
the
labor
temple
yes
i
would
see
him
through
by
all
means
said
he
but
you
must
come
early
for
i
can
not
where
shall
i
come
come
here
i
am
sure
these
people
will
give
me
he
looked
about
him
i
suspect
that
some
of
them
sleep
in
this
room
but
they
have
a
little
porch
outside
and
if
they
will
let
me
stay
there
i
shall
be
alone
which
is
what
i
want
after
a
moment
he
added
what
i
wish
to
do
is
to
pray
have
you
ever
tried
prayer
mary
she
answered
simply
i
would
know
come
to
me
and
i
will
teach
you
he
said
xxiv
i
went
early
next
morning
but
not
early
enough
the
mexican
woman
told
me
that
the
master
had
waited
and
finally
had
gone
he
had
asked
the
way
to
the
labor
temple
and
left
word
that
i
would
find
him
there
so
i
stepped
back
into
my
taxi
and
told
the
driver
to
take
the
most
direct
route
meantime
i
kept
watch
for
my
friend
and
i
did
not
have
to
watch
very
long
there
was
a
crowd
ahead
the
street
was
blocked
and
a
premonition
came
to
me
good
lord
i
too
late
he
got
into
some
new
mess
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
sure
enough
there
he
was
standing
on
the
of
a
truck
haranguing
a
crowd
which
packed
the
street
from
one
line
of
houses
to
the
other
and
before
he
got
half
way
to
the
labor
temple
i
thought
to
myself
i
got
out
and
paid
the
driver
of
the
taxi
and
pushed
into
the
crowd
now
and
then
i
caught
a
few
words
of
what
carpenter
was
telling
them
and
it
seemed
quite
harmless
that
they
were
all
brothers
that
they
should
love
one
another
and
not
do
one
another
injustice
what
could
there
have
been
that
made
him
think
it
necessary
to
deliver
this
message
before
breakfast
i
looked
about
noting
that
it
was
the
hebrew
quarter
of
the
city
plastered
with
signs
with
queer
letters
i
thought
holy
smoke
is
he
going
to
convert
the
jews
i
pushed
my
way
farther
into
the
crowd
and
saw
a
policeman
and
went
up
to
him
officer
what
this
all
about
i
spoke
as
one
wearing
the
latest
cut
of
clothes
and
he
answered
accordingly
search
me
they
brought
us
out
on
a
riot
call
but
when
we
got
here
it
seems
to
have
turned
into
a
revival
i
got
part
of
the
story
from
this
policeman
and
part
from
a
couple
of
bystanders
it
appeared
that
some
jewish
lady
getting
her
shopping
done
early
had
complained
of
getting
short
weight
and
the
butcher
had
ordered
her
out
of
his
shop
and
she
had
stopped
to
express
her
opinion
of
profiteers
and
he
had
thrown
her
out
and
she
had
stood
on
the
sidewalk
and
shrieked
until
all
the
ladies
in
this
crowded
quarter
had
joined
her
their
fury
against
soaring
prices
and
wages
that
never
kept
up
with
them
had
burst
all
bounds
and
they
had
set
out
to
clean
up
the
with
the
butcher
so
there
was
carpenter
on
his
way
to
the
labor
temple
with
another
mob
to
quell
you
know
how
it
is
said
the
policeman
it
really
does
cost
these
poor
devils
a
lot
to
live
and
they
say
prices
are
going
down
but
i
ca
see
it
anywhere
but
in
the
well
said
i
i
guess
you
were
glad
enough
to
have
somebody
do
this
he
grinned
you
bet
i
tackled
crowds
of
women
before
this
and
you
do
like
to
hit
them
but
they
claw
into
your
face
if
you
do
i
guess
the
captain
will
let
this
bird
spout
for
a
bit
even
if
he
does
block
the
we
listened
for
a
minute
bear
in
mind
my
friends
i
am
come
among
you
and
i
shall
not
desert
you
i
give
you
my
justice
i
give
you
my
freedom
your
cause
is
my
cause
world
without
end
now
would
that
jar
you
remarked
the
holy
christ
if
you
hear
some
of
the
nuts
we
have
to
listen
to
on
what
do
you
suppose
that
guy
thinks
he
can
do
dressed
up
in
abraham
nightshirt
said
carpenter
the
days
of
the
exploiter
are
numbered
the
thrones
of
the
mighty
are
tottering
and
the
earth
shall
belong
to
them
that
labor
he
that
toils
not
neither
shall
he
eat
and
they
that
grow
fat
upon
the
blood
of
the
people
they
shall
grow
lean
now
what
do
you
think
o
that
demanded
the
guardian
of
authority
if
that
ai
regular
bolsheviki
talk
then
i
dopy
i
bet
the
captain
do
stand
much
more
of
fortunately
the
captain
endurance
was
not
put
to
the
test
the
orator
had
reached
the
climax
of
his
eloquence
the
kingdom
of
righteousness
is
at
hand
the
word
will
be
spoken
the
way
will
be
made
clear
meantime
my
people
i
bid
you
go
your
way
in
peace
let
there
be
no
more
disturbance
to
bring
upon
you
the
contempt
of
those
who
do
not
understand
your
troubles
nor
share
the
heartbreak
of
the
poor
my
people
take
my
peace
with
you
he
stretched
out
his
arms
in
invocation
and
there
was
a
murmur
of
applause
and
the
crowd
began
slowly
to
disperse
which
seemed
to
remind
my
friend
the
policeman
that
he
had
authority
to
exercise
he
began
to
poke
his
stick
into
the
humped
backs
of
poor
jewish
tailors
and
into
the
ample
stomachs
of
fat
jewish
housewives
come
on
now
get
along
with
you
and
let
somebody
else
have
a
bit
o
the
i
pushed
my
way
forward
by
virtue
of
my
good
clothes
and
got
through
the
press
about
carpenter
and
took
him
by
the
arm
saying
come
on
now
let
see
if
we
ca
get
to
the
labor
xxv
there
was
a
crowd
following
us
of
course
and
i
sought
to
keep
carpenter
busy
in
conversation
to
indicate
that
the
crowd
was
not
wanted
but
before
we
had
gone
half
a
block
i
felt
some
one
touch
me
on
the
arm
and
heard
a
voice
saying
i
beg
pardon
i
a
reporter
for
the
now
of
course
i
had
known
this
must
come
i
had
realized
that
i
would
be
getting
myself
in
for
it
if
i
went
to
join
carpenter
that
morning
i
had
planned
to
warn
him
to
explain
to
him
what
our
newspapers
are
but
how
could
i
have
foreseen
that
he
was
going
to
get
into
a
riot
before
breakfast
and
bring
out
the
police
reserves
and
the
police
reporters
excuse
us
i
said
coldly
we
have
something
urgent
i
just
want
to
get
something
of
this
gentleman
speech
we
are
on
our
way
to
the
labor
temple
if
you
will
come
there
in
a
couple
of
hours
we
will
give
you
an
but
i
must
have
a
story
for
our
first
edition
that
goes
to
press
before
i
had
carpenter
by
the
arm
and
kept
him
firmly
walking
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
reporter
but
i
was
resolved
to
get
my
warning
spoken
regardless
of
anything
said
i
this
is
a
matter
extremely
urgent
for
you
to
understand
carpenter
this
young
man
represents
a
newspaper
and
anything
you
say
to
him
will
be
read
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
by
perhaps
a
hundred
thousand
people
if
it
is
found
especially
senational
the
continental
press
may
put
it
on
its
wires
and
it
will
go
to
several
hundred
papers
all
over
the
country
twelve
hundred
and
papers
corrected
the
young
man
so
you
see
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
be
careful
what
you
say
far
more
so
than
if
you
were
speaking
to
a
handful
of
mexican
laborers
or
jewish
said
carpenter
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
when
i
speak
i
speak
the
yes
of
course
i
replied
and
meantime
i
was
racking
my
poor
wits
figuring
out
how
to
present
this
strange
acquaintance
of
mine
most
tactfully
to
the
world
i
knew
the
reporter
would
not
tarry
long
he
would
grab
a
few
sentences
and
rush
away
to
telephone
them
in
i
tell
you
what
i
free
to
tell
i
began
this
gentleman
is
a
healer
a
man
of
very
remarkable
gifts
mental
healing
you
i
get
you
said
the
reporter
some
religion
mr
carpenter
teaches
a
new
i
see
a
sort
of
prophet
and
where
does
he
come
from
i
tried
to
evade
he
has
just
arrived
but
the
of
the
press
was
not
going
to
be
evaded
where
do
you
come
from
sir
he
demanded
of
carpenter
to
which
carpenter
answered
promptly
from
from
god
er
oh
i
see
from
god
most
interesting
how
long
ago
may
i
ask
oh
that
is
indeed
extraordinary
and
this
mob
that
you
just
been
addressing
did
you
use
some
kind
of
mind
cure
on
them
i
could
see
the
story
taking
shape
the
headlines
flamed
before
my
mind
eye
streamer
heads
all
the
way
across
the
sheet
after
the
fashion
of
our
evening
papers
prophet
fresh
from
god
quells
mob
xxvi
i
came
to
a
sudden
decision
in
this
crisis
the
sensible
thing
to
do
was
to
meet
the
issue
boldly
and
take
the
job
of
launching
carpenter
under
proper
auspices
he
really
was
a
wonderful
man
and
deserved
to
be
treated
decently
i
addressed
the
reporter
again
listen
this
gentleman
is
a
man
of
remarkable
gifts
and
does
not
take
money
for
them
so
if
you
are
going
to
tell
about
him
at
all
do
it
in
a
dignified
of
course
i
had
no
other
idea
your
city
editor
might
have
another
idea
i
remarked
drily
permit
me
to
introduce
i
gave
him
my
name
and
saw
him
start
you
mean
then
giving
me
a
swift
glance
he
decided
it
was
not
necessary
to
complete
the
question
said
i
here
is
my
card
and
handed
it
to
him
he
glanced
at
it
and
said
i
be
very
glad
to
explain
matters
to
the
desk
and
see
that
the
story
is
handled
exactly
as
you
thank
you
i
replied
now
yesterday
i
was
caught
in
that
mob
at
the
picture
theatre
and
knocked
nearly
insensible
this
gentleman
found
me
and
healed
me
almost
instantly
naturally
i
am
grateful
and
as
i
find
that
he
is
a
teacher
who
aids
the
poor
and
will
not
take
money
from
anyone
i
want
to
thank
him
publicly
and
help
to
make
him
of
course
of
course
said
the
reporter
and
before
my
mind
eye
flashed
a
new
set
of
headlines
wealthy
clubman
miraculously
healed
or
perhaps
it
would
be
a
double
head
clubman
slugged
by
mob
healed
by
prophet
wealthy
scion
victim
of
picture
riot
restored
by
man
fresh
from
god
i
thought
that
was
sensation
enough
and
that
the
interview
would
end
but
alas
for
my
hopes
said
that
of
the
press
will
you
give
public
healings
to
the
people
carpenter
to
which
carpenter
answered
i
am
not
interested
in
giving
what
why
not
worldly
and
corrupt
people
ask
me
to
do
miracles
to
prove
my
power
to
them
but
the
proof
i
bring
to
the
world
is
a
new
vision
and
a
new
oh
i
see
your
religion
may
i
ask
about
it
you
are
the
first
the
world
will
follow
you
say
to
the
people
that
i
have
come
to
understand
the
nature
and
causes
of
their
mobs
said
the
puzzled
young
i
wish
to
understand
a
land
which
is
governed
by
mobs
i
wish
to
know
who
lives
upon
the
madness
of
you
have
been
studying
a
mob
this
morning
inquired
the
reporter
i
ask
why
do
the
police
of
mobland
put
down
the
mobs
of
the
poor
and
not
the
mobs
of
the
rich
i
ask
who
pays
the
police
and
who
pays
the
i
see
you
are
some
kind
of
radical
and
with
sickness
of
soul
i
saw
another
headline
before
my
mind
eye
wealthy
clubman
aids
bolshevik
prophet
i
hastened
to
break
in
mr
carpenter
is
not
a
radical
he
is
a
lover
of
but
then
i
realized
that
did
not
sound
just
right
how
the
devil
was
i
to
describe
this
man
how
came
it
that
all
the
phrases
of
brotherhood
and
love
had
come
to
be
tainted
with
radicalism
i
tried
again
he
is
a
friend
of
oh
really
observed
the
reporter
a
pacifist
hey
and
i
thought
damn
the
hound
i
knew
of
course
that
he
had
the
rest
of
the
formula
in
his
head
out
loud
i
said
he
teaches
but
the
hound
was
not
interested
in
my
generalities
and
evasions
where
have
you
seen
mobs
of
the
rich
carpenter
i
have
seen
them
whirling
through
the
streets
in
automobiles
killing
the
children
of
the
you
have
seen
that
i
saw
it
last
now
i
had
inspected
our
times
and
our
examiner
that
morning
and
noted
that
both
in
their
accounts
of
the
accident
had
given
only
the
name
of
the
chauffeur
and
suppressed
that
of
the
owner
i
understood
what
an
amount
of
social
and
financial
pressure
that
feat
had
taken
and
here
was
carpenter
about
to
spoil
it
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
arm
saying
my
friend
you
were
a
guest
in
that
car
you
are
not
at
liberty
to
talk
about
i
expected
to
be
argued
with
but
carpenter
apparently
conceded
my
point
for
he
fell
silent
it
was
the
young
reporter
who
spoke
you
were
in
an
auto
accident
i
judge
we
had
only
one
report
of
a
death
and
that
was
caused
by
stebbins
car
were
you
in
that
then
as
neither
carpenter
nor
i
replied
he
laughed
it
matter
because
i
could
use
the
story
stebbins
is
one
of
our
cows
and
thank
he
started
away
and
suddenly
all
my
terror
of
newspaper
publicity
overwhelmed
me
i
simply
could
not
face
the
public
as
guardian
of
a
bolshevik
i
shouted
young
man
and
the
reporter
turned
respectfully
to
listen
i
tell
you
carpenter
is
a
radical
get
that
clear
and
to
the
young
man
skeptical
i
exclaimed
he
a
christian
at
which
the
reporter
laughed
out
loud
xxvii
we
got
to
the
labor
temple
and
found
the
place
in
a
buzz
of
excitement
over
what
had
occurred
in
front
of
prince
last
night
i
had
suspected
rough
work
on
the
part
of
the
police
and
here
was
the
living
evidence
men
with
bandages
over
cracked
heads
men
pulling
open
their
shirts
or
pulling
up
their
sleeves
to
show
black
and
blue
bruises
in
the
headquarters
of
the
restaurant
workers
we
found
a
crowd
jabbering
in
a
dozen
languages
about
their
troubles
we
learned
that
there
were
eight
in
jail
and
several
in
the
hospital
one
not
expected
to
live
all
that
had
been
going
on
while
we
sat
at
table
gluttonizing
and
while
tears
were
running
down
carpenter
cheeks
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
third
man
in
the
crowd
had
one
of
the
morning
newspapers
in
his
hand
the
newspapers
which
told
how
a
furious
mob
of
armed
ruffians
had
sought
to
break
its
way
into
prince
and
had
with
difficulty
been
driven
off
by
the
gallant
protectors
of
the
law
a
man
would
read
some
passage
which
struck
him
as
especially
false
he
would
tell
what
he
had
seen
or
done
and
he
would
crumple
the
paper
in
his
hand
and
cry
the
liars
the
dirty
liars
adding
adjectives
not
suitable
for
print
i
realized
more
than
ever
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
in
letting
carpenter
get
into
this
place
it
was
no
resort
for
anybody
who
wanted
to
be
patriotic
or
happy
about
the
world
all
sorts
of
wonderful
promises
had
been
made
to
labor
to
persuade
it
to
win
the
war
and
now
labor
came
with
the
blank
check
duly
filled
out
according
to
its
fancy
and
was
in
process
of
being
kicked
downstairs
wages
were
being
liquidated
as
the
phrase
had
it
and
there
was
an
endless
succession
of
futile
strikes
all
pitiful
failures
you
must
understand
that
western
city
is
the
home
of
the
open
shop
the
poor
devils
who
went
on
strike
were
locked
out
of
the
factories
and
slugged
off
the
streets
their
organizations
were
betrayed
by
spies
and
their
policies
dedeviled
by
provocateurs
and
all
the
mass
of
misery
resulting
seemed
to
have
crowded
into
one
building
this
bright
november
morning
pitiful
figures
men
and
women
and
even
a
few
children
for
some
had
been
turned
out
of
their
homes
and
had
no
place
to
go
ragged
haggard
and
underfed
weeping
some
of
them
with
pain
or
lifting
their
clenched
hands
in
a
passion
of
impotent
fury
my
friend
the
king
of
the
movies
with
all
his
resources
could
not
have
made
a
more
complete
picture
of
human
misery
nor
one
more
fitted
to
work
on
the
sensitive
soul
of
a
prophet
and
persuade
him
that
capitalist
america
was
worse
than
imperial
rome
the
arrival
of
carpenter
attracted
no
particular
attention
the
troubles
of
these
people
were
too
recent
for
them
to
be
aware
of
anything
else
all
they
wanted
was
some
one
to
tell
their
troubles
to
and
they
quickly
found
that
this
stranger
was
available
for
the
purpose
he
asked
many
questions
and
before
long
had
a
crowd
about
him
as
if
he
were
some
sort
of
government
commissioner
conducting
an
investigation
it
was
an
all
day
job
apparently
i
hung
round
trying
to
keep
myself
inconspicuous
towards
noon
came
a
boy
with
newspapers
and
i
bought
the
early
edition
of
the
evening
yes
there
it
was
all
the
way
across
the
front
page
not
even
a
big
fire
at
the
harbor
and
an
earthquake
in
japan
had
been
able
to
displace
it
as
i
had
foreseen
the
reporter
had
played
up
the
most
sensational
aspects
of
the
matter
carpenter
announced
himself
as
a
prophet
only
hours
out
of
god
presence
and
proved
it
by
healing
the
lame
and
the
halt
and
the
blind
and
also
by
hypnotising
everyone
he
spoke
to
from
a
wealthy
young
clubman
to
a
mob
of
jewish
housewives
incidentally
he
denounced
america
as
mobland
and
called
it
a
country
governed
by
madmen
i
took
the
paper
to
him
thinking
to
teach
him
a
little
worldly
prudence
said
i
you
remember
i
tried
to
keep
out
that
stuff
about
mobs
he
took
the
sheet
from
my
hands
and
looked
at
the
headlines
i
saw
his
nostrils
dilate
and
his
eyes
flash
mobs
this
paper
is
a
mob
it
is
the
worst
of
your
mobs
and
it
fell
to
the
floor
and
he
put
his
foot
on
the
flaring
print
said
he
you
talk
about
mobs
listen
to
then
to
one
of
the
group
about
him
tell
how
they
mobbed
you
the
man
thus
addressed
a
little
russian
tailor
named
korwsky
narrated
in
his
halting
english
that
he
was
the
secretary
of
the
tailors
union
and
they
had
a
strike
and
a
few
days
ago
their
offices
had
been
raided
at
night
the
door
jimmed
open
and
the
desk
rifled
of
all
the
papers
and
records
evidently
it
had
been
done
by
the
bosses
or
their
agents
for
nothing
had
been
taken
but
papers
which
would
be
of
use
against
the
strike
dey
got
our
members
list
said
korwsky
dey
send
people
to
frighten
back
to
verk
dey
call
loans
dey
git
girls
fired
from
stores
if
dey
got
jobs
dey
hound
every
way
the
speaker
went
on
to
declare
that
no
such
job
could
have
been
pulled
off
without
the
police
knowing
yet
they
made
no
move
to
arrest
the
criminals
his
voice
trembled
with
indignation
and
carpenter
turned
to
me
you
have
mobs
that
come
at
night
with
dark
lanterns
and
tools
i
had
noticed
among
the
men
talking
to
carpenter
one
who
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
him
he
was
tall
and
not
too
well
nourished
but
instead
of
the
prophet
robes
of
white
and
amethyst
he
wore
the
clothes
of
a
a
little
too
short
in
the
sleeves
and
where
carpenter
had
a
soft
and
silky
brown
beard
this
man
had
a
skinny
adam
apple
that
worked
up
and
down
he
was
something
of
an
agitator
i
judged
and
he
appeared
to
have
a
religious
streak
i
am
a
christian
i
heard
him
say
but
one
of
the
kind
that
speak
out
against
injustice
and
i
can
show
you
bible
texts
for
it
he
insisted
i
can
prove
it
by
the
word
of
this
man
name
was
james
and
i
learned
that
he
was
one
of
the
striking
carpenters
the
prophet
turned
to
him
and
said
tell
him
your
so
the
other
took
from
his
pocket
a
greasy
and
produced
a
newspaper
clipping
quoting
an
injunction
which
judge
wollcott
had
issued
against
his
union
read
that
said
he
but
i
answered
that
i
knew
about
it
i
remember
hearing
my
uncle
laughing
over
the
matter
at
the
saying
that
bobbie
wollcott
had
forbidden
the
strikers
to
do
everything
but
sit
on
air
and
walk
on
water
and
now
i
got
another
view
of
bobbie
this
time
from
a
prophet
fresh
from
god
said
the
prophet
your
judges
are
mobs
xxviii
soon
after
the
there
pushed
his
way
into
the
crowd
a
young
man
whom
i
recognized
as
one
of
the
secretaries
of
he
was
looking
for
me
and
told
me
in
a
whisper
that
his
employer
was
downstairs
in
his
car
and
wanted
to
see
carpenter
and
myself
about
something
important
he
did
not
want
to
come
up
because
it
was
too
conspicuous
would
we
come
down
and
take
a
little
drive
i
answered
that
i
should
be
willing
but
i
knew
carpenter
would
not
he
had
been
in
an
automobile
accident
the
night
before
and
had
refused
to
ride
again
then
said
the
secretary
was
there
some
room
where
we
could
meet
i
went
to
one
of
the
officials
and
asked
for
a
vacant
room
where
i
could
talk
about
a
private
matter
with
a
friend
i
managed
to
separate
carpenter
from
his
crowd
and
took
him
to
the
room
and
presently
everett
the
secretary
came
with
the
great
man
shook
hands
cordially
with
both
of
us
then
looking
round
to
make
sure
that
no
one
heard
us
he
began
mr
carpenter
i
told
you
i
vould
give
a
tousand
dollars
to
dese
the
other
face
which
had
looked
so
grey
and
haggard
was
suddenly
illumined
as
if
by
his
magical
halo
i
had
forgotten
it
there
are
so
many
hungry
in
there
i
have
been
watching
them
wondering
when
they
would
be
all
right
said
here
you
and
reaching
into
his
pocket
he
produced
a
wad
of
new
shiny
hundred
dollar
notes
folded
together
count
carpenter
took
the
money
in
his
hand
so
this
is
it
he
said
he
looked
at
it
as
if
he
were
inspecting
some
strange
creature
from
the
wilds
of
patagonia
it
de
real
stuff
said
with
a
grin
the
stuff
for
which
men
sell
their
souls
and
women
their
virtue
for
which
you
starve
and
beat
and
torture
one
another
ai
it
pretty
said
the
magnate
not
a
bit
embarrassed
the
other
began
reading
the
writing
on
the
notes
as
you
may
remember
having
done
in
some
time
of
childhood
whose
picture
is
this
he
asked
i
dunno
said
the
magnate
de
secretary
of
de
treasury
i
but
said
the
other
why
not
your
picture
mine
of
my
picture
on
de
money
why
not
you
are
the
one
who
makes
it
and
enables
everyone
else
to
make
it
was
one
of
those
brand
new
ideas
that
come
only
to
geniuses
and
children
i
could
see
that
had
never
thought
of
it
before
also
that
he
found
it
interesting
to
think
of
carpenter
went
on
if
your
picture
was
on
it
then
every
one
would
know
what
it
meant
people
would
say
unto
the
things
that
are
when
you
were
paying
off
your
mobs
you
would
pay
them
with
your
own
money
and
whenever
they
spent
it
the
people
would
bow
to
caesar
i
mean
to
he
said
it
without
the
trace
of
a
smile
and
had
no
idea
there
was
a
smile
anywhere
in
the
neighborhood
in
a
tone
he
said
i
tink
about
then
he
went
on
you
give
it
to
de
strikers
but
carpenter
interrupted
it
was
you
who
were
going
to
give
it
i
can
not
give
nor
take
you
mean
you
vo
take
it

was
that

and
you

afraid
to

them
afraid
to
feed
the
poor
the
wondering
look
came
again
to
his
face
the
world
is
organized
he
said
to
himself

a
mob
of
masters

unchanged
in
his
cheerful
you

a
tousand
dollars
and
you

a
lot
nobody
can
do
it
but
carpenter
was
not
satisfied
he
shook
his
head
sadly

this
he
said
and
pressed
the
roll
of
bills
back
into
the
hands
of
the
astounded
magnate
xxix
however
had
come
there
to
get
something
that
day
and
i
thought

carpenter
became
suddenly
grave
my
friend
said
he
a
long
time
ago
there
was
a
prophet
and
he
was
offered
the
world
the
story
is
told
us
the
devil
taketh
him
up
into
an
exceeding
high
mountain
and
sheweth
him
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
the
glory
of
them
and
saith
unto
him
all
these
things
will
i
give
thee
if
thou
wilt
fall
down
and
worship
me
you
recall
that
story
no
said
i
ai
vun
o
dese
litry
but
he
realized
that
the
story
was
not
complimentary
to
him
and
he
showed
his
chagrin
i
tell
you
vun
ting
carpenter
if
you
vas
to
know
me
better
you
vould
call
me
a
and
suddenly
the
other
put
his
hand
on
the
great
man
shoulder
i
believe
that
my
friend
i
hate
the
sin
but
love
the
sinner
and
so
suppose
you
come
to
lunch
with
me
lunch
said
taken
aback
i
went
to
dinner
with
you
last
night
now
you
come
to
lunch
with
vere
at
carpenter
said
carpenter
when
i
went
with
you
i
did
not
ask
carpenter
signed
to
me
and
to
everett
the
secretary
and
the
four
of
us
went
out
of
the
room
i
was
as
much
mystified
as
the
picture
magnate
but
i
held
my
peace
and
carpenter
led
us
to
the
elevator
and
down
to
the
street
no
said
he
to
there
is
no
need
to
get
into
your
car
the
place
is
just
around
the
and
he
put
his
arm
in
that
of
the
magnate
and
led
him
down
the
street
somewhat
to
the
embarrassment
of
his
victim
for
there
was
a
crowd
following
us
people
had
read
the
afternoon
papers
by
now
and
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
walk
along
unheeded
with
a
prophet
only
hours
from
god
who
healed
the
sick
and
quelled
mobs
before
breakfast
but
set
his
teeth
and
bore
it
hoping
this
might
be
the
way
to
land
his
contract
xxx
we
turned
the
corner
and
soon
i
saw
what
was
before
us
and
almost
cried
out
with
glee
it
was
really
too
good
to
be
true
carpenter
in
the
course
of
his
talks
with
strikers
had
learned
where
their
was
located
the
where
their
families
were
being
fed
and
he
now
had
the
sublime
audacity
to
take
the
picture
magnate
to
lunch
among
them
the
place
was
an
empty
warehouse
fitted
with
long
tables
and
benches
made
of
planks
that
were
old
and
full
of
splinters
here
in
rows
of
twenty
or
thirty
were
seated
men
and
women
and
children
mixed
together
before
each
one
a
bowl
of
not
very
thick
soup
and
a
hunk
of
bread
and
a
tin
cup
full
of
hot
brown
liquid
politely
taken
for
coffee
it
was
a
meal
which
would
have
been
spurned
by
any
of
the
studio
bums
of
but
now
was
going
to
be
a
good
sport
and
sit
on
a
splintery
plank
and
eat
it
nor
was
that
all
as
we
pushed
our
way
into
the
place
carpenter
turned
to
the
magnate
and
without
a
trace
of
embarrassment
said
you
understand
i
have
no
money
but
we
must
pay
oh
sure
said
quickly
i
pay
thank
you
said
the
other
and
he
turned
to
an
official
of
the
union
with
whom
he
had
got
acquainted
in
the
course
of
the
morning
he
introduced
us
all
not
forgetting
the
secretary
and
then
said
mr
is
the
moving
picture
producer
and
wants
to
have
lunch
with
you
if
you
will
oh
sure
said
the
official
cordially
he
will
pay
for
it
added
carpenter
he
has
brought
along
a
thousand
dollars
for
that
started
as
if
some
one
had
struck
him
and
the
official
started
too
what
he
will
pay
a
thousand
dollars
declared
carpenter
it
is
a
fact
and
you
may
tell
the
people
if
you
my
gawd
no
cried
wildly
but
the
official
did
not
heed
him
he
faced
the
crowd
and
stretched
out
his
arms
boys
boys
this
is
the
picture
producer
and
he
come
to
lunch
with
us
and
he
going
to
pay
a
thousand
dollars
for
it
there
was
a
moment
of
amazed
silence
then
a
roar
from
the
company
men
leaped
to
their
feet
and
yelled
and
there
stood
poor
enjoying
the
ovation
give
it
to
them
whispered
carpenter
and
the
magnate
thus
held
up
took
out
the
roll
of
bills
and
turned
it
over
to
the
trembling
official
who
leaped
onto
a
chair
and
waved
the
miracle
before
the
crowd
a
thousand
dollars
a
thousand
dollars
he
counted
it
over
before
their
eyes
and
called
louder
than
ever
a
thousand
dollars
carpenter
followed
by
and
the
secretary
and
myself
went
down
the
line
of
tables
shaking
hands
with
many
on
the
way
and
being
patted
on
the
back
by
others
also
shook
hands
and
was
patted
seats
were
found
for
us
and
food
was
brought
double
portions
of
it
as
if
to
make
the
plight
of
the
poor
magnate
even
more
absurd
i
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
he
enjoyed
that
costly
meal
just
about
as
much
as
carpenter
had
enjoyed
the
one
at
prince
last
night
however
he
was
game
and
spilled
no
tears
into
his
soup
and
carpenter
ate
with
honest
appetite
having
had
no
breakfast
the
strikers
about
us
ate
as
if
they
had
missed
both
breakfast
and
supper
they
laughed
and
chatted
and
made
jokes
with
us
you
would
have
thought
they
were
celebrating
the
winning
of
the
strike
and
the
end
of
all
their
troubles
in
the
midst
of
the
meal
i
noted
two
young
men
by
the
door
asking
questions
i
chuckled
to
myself
seeing
more
double
ones
and
extra
size
prophet
of
god
vamps
movie
king
magnate
of
screen
pays
thousand
for
lunch
but
i
knew
that
had
never
yet
paid
a
thousand
dollars
without
getting
something
for
it
and
i
was
not
surprised
when
after
he
had
gulped
down
his
meal
he
turned
to
his
host
and
disregarding
the
company
and
the
excitement
demanded
now
carpenter
tell
me
do
i
git
de
contract
carpenter
had
had
his
jest
and
was
through
with
it
he
answered
gravely
you
must
understand
me
you
do
want
a
contract
with
i
do
if
i
were
to
sign
it
it
would
not
be
a
week
before
you
would
be
sorry
and
would
be
asking
me
to
release
vy
is
dat
carpenter
because
i
am
going
to
do
things
which
will
make
me
quite
useless
to
you
in
a
business
dat
ca
be
true
carpenter
it
is
true
and
you
will
realize
it
soon
i
assure
you
it
wo
be
a
day
before
you
will
be
ashamed
of
having
known
was
gazing
at
the
speaker
not
certain
whether
this
was
something
very
terrible
or
only
a
polite
evasion
mr
carpenter
he
answered
if
all
de
vorld
vas
to
give
you
up
i
vould
said
carpenter
i
tell
you
before
the
cock
crows
again
you
will
deny
three
times
that
you
know
and
then
without
awaiting
response
from
the
amazed
he
turned
to
speak
to
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
him
the
magnate
of
the
pictures
sat
silent
evidently
frightened
at
last
he
turned
to
me
and
asked
vot
you
tink
he
meant
by
dat
billy
i
answered
i
think
he
meant
that
you
are
to
play
the
part
of
peter
peter
pan
no
peter
who
denied
his
vell
said
patiently
you
know
i
ai
vun
o
dese
litry
i
tell
it
to
you
some
time
i
continued
it
kind
of
funny
if
he
right
you
are
going
to
be
the
first
pope
and
sit
at
the
golden
gate
holding
the
keys
of
my
gawd
said
and
you
made
a
record
in
the
i
added
you
played
satan
and
peter
both
on
the
same
day
that
is
with
a
vengeance
xxxi
when
i
got
back
to
the
labor
temple
i
learned
that
there
was
to
be
a
of
the
strikers
this
saturday
evening
it
had
been
planned
some
days
ago
and
now
was
to
be
turned
into
a
protest
against
police
violence
and
government
by
there
was
a
cheap
afternoon
paper
which
professed
sympathy
with
the
workers
and
this
published
a
manifesto
signed
by
a
number
of
labor
leaders
summoning
their
followers
to
make
clear
that
they
would
no
longer
submit
to
cossack
it
appeared
now
that
these
leaders
were
considering
inviting
carpenter
to
become
one
of
the
speakers
at
their
meeting
two
of
them
came
up
to
me
i
had
heard
this
stranger
speak
and
did
i
think
he
could
hold
an
audience
i
gave
assurance
he
was
a
man
of
dignity
and
would
do
them
credit
they
were
afraid
the
newspapers
would
represent
him
as
a
freak
but
of
course
their
meeting
would
hardly
fare
very
well
in
the
papers
anyhow
one
of
them
asked
cautiously
how
much
of
an
extremist
was
he
labor
leaders
were
having
a
hard
time
these
days
to
hold
down
the
reds
and
the
employers
were
not
giving
them
any
help
did
i
think
carpenter
would
support
the
reds
i
answered
that
i
did
know
the
labor
movement
well
enough
to
judge
but
one
thing
they
could
be
sure
of
he
was
a
man
of
peace
and
would
not
preach
any
sort
of
violence
the
matter
was
settled
a
little
later
when
mary
magna
drove
up
to
the
labor
temple
in
her
big
limousine
mary
for
the
first
time
in
the
memory
of
anyone
who
knew
her
was
without
her
dressed
like
a
quakeress
a
most
uncanny
phenomenon
she
had
not
a
single
jewel
on
and
before
long
i
learned
why
she
had
taken
all
she
owned
to
a
jeweler
that
morning
and
sold
them
for
something
over
six
thousand
dollars
she
brought
the
money
to
the
fund
for
the
babies
of
the
strikers
nor
did
she
ask
anyone
else
to
hand
it
in
for
her
it
was
mary
fashion
to
look
the
world
in
the
eye
and
say
what
she
was
doing
was
still
hanging
about
and
at
first
he
tried
to
check
this
insane
extravagance
but
then
he
thought
it
over
and
grinned
saying
i
git
my
tousand
dollars
back
in
advertising
when
i
pointed
out
to
him
what
would
be
the
interpretation
placed
by
newspaper
gossip
on
mary
intervention
in
the
affairs
of
carpenter
he
grinned
still
more
widely
ai
he
got
a
right
to
be
in
love
vit
mary
all
de
vorld
in
love
vit
mary
and
of
course
there
was
a
newspaper
reporter
standing
by
his
side
so
that
this
remark
went
out
to
the
world
as
comment
you
understand
that
by
this
time
the
second
edition
of
the
papers
was
on
the
streets
and
it
was
known
that
the
new
prophet
was
at
the
labor
temple
curiosity
seekers
came
filtering
in
among
them
half
a
dozen
more
reporters
and
as
many
camera
men
after
that
poor
carpenter
could
get
no
peace
at
all
would
he
please
say
if
he
was
going
to
do
any
more
healing
would
he
turn
a
little
more
to
the
light
just
one
second
thank
you
would
he
mind
making
a
group
with
miss
magna
and
and
the
wealthy
young
scion
would
he
consent
to
step
outside
for
some
moving
pictures
before
the
light
got
too
dim
it
was
a
new
kind
of
mob
a
ravening
one
making
all
dignity
and
thought
impossible
in
the
end
i
had
to
mount
guard
and
fight
the
away
was
it
likely
this
man
would
go
out
and
pose
for
cameras
when
he
had
just
refused
fifteen
hundred
dollars
a
week
from
to
do
that
very
thing
and
then
more
excitement
had
he
really
refused
such
an
offer
the
king
of
the
movies
admitted
that
he
had
we
live
in
an
age
of
communication
we
can
send
a
bit
of
news
half
way
round
the
world
in
a
few
seconds
we
can
make
it
known
to
a
whole
city
in
a
few
hours
and
so
it
was
with
this
prophet
fresh
from
god
in
spite
of
himself
he
was
seized
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
flung
up
to
the
pinnacle
of
fame
he
had
all
the
marvels
of
a
lifetime
crowded
into
one
day
enough
to
fill
a
whole
newspaper
with
headlines
and
the
end
was
not
yet
suddenly
there
was
a
commotion
in
the
crowd
and
a
man
pushed
his
way
through
korwsky
the
secretary
of
the
tailor
union
who
learning
of
carpenter
miracles
had
rushed
all
the
way
home
and
got
a
friend
with
a
delivery
wagon
and
brought
his
son
he
bore
him
now
in
his
arms
and
poured
out
to
carpenter
the
pitiful
tale
of
his
paralyzed
limbs
such
a
gentle
good
child
he
was
no
one
ever
heard
a
complaint
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
stand
up
for
five
years
so
of
course
carpenter
put
his
hands
upon
the
child
and
closed
his
eyes
in
prayer
and
suddenly
he
put
him
down
to
the
ground
and
cried
walk
the
lad
stared
at
him
for
one
wild
moment
while
people
caught
their
breath
then
with
a
little
choking
cry
he
took
a
step
there
came
a
shout
from
the
spectators
and
then
bang
a
puff
as
if
a
gun
had
gone
off
and
a
flash
of
light
and
clouds
of
white
smoke
rolling
to
the
ceiling
women
screamed
and
one
or
two
threatened
to
faint
but
it
was
nothing
more
dangerous
than
the
cameraman
of
the
independent
press
service
who
had
hired
a
and
got
it
set
up
in
a
corner
of
the
room
ready
for
any
climax
a
fine
piece
of
stage
management
said
his
jealous
rivals
others
in
the
crowd
were
sure
it
was
a
put
up
job
between
carpenter
and
korwsky
but
the
labor
leaders
knew
the
little
tailor
and
they
believed
after
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
carpenter
being
a
speaker
at
the
xxxii
it
came
time
when
the
rest
of
us
were
ready
for
dinner
but
carpenter
said
that
he
wanted
to
pray
apparently
whenever
he
was
tired
and
had
work
to
do
he
prayed
he
told
me
that
he
would
find
his
own
way
to
grant
hall
the
place
of
the
but
somehow
i
did
like
the
idea
of
his
walking
through
the
streets
alone
i
said
i
would
call
for
him
at
and
made
him
promise
not
to
leave
the
labor
temple
until
that
hour
i
cast
about
in
my
mind
for
a
and
bethought
me
of
old
joe
his
name
is
joseph
camper
and
he
played
with
my
elder
brother
in
the
days
before
they
opened
up
the
game
and
when
beef
was
what
counted
old
joe
has
shoulders
like
the
biggest
hams
in
a
butcher
shop
and
you
can
trust
him
like
a
newfoundland
dog
i
knew
that
if
i
asked
him
not
to
let
anybody
hurt
my
friend
he
would
and
this
regardless
of
the
circumstance
of
my
not
wearing
pants
old
joe
knows
nothing
about
religion
or
sociology
only
wrestling
and
and
the
price
of
wholesale
stationery
so
i
phoned
him
to
meet
me
and
we
had
dinner
and
at
sharp
our
taxi
crew
drew
up
at
the
labor
temple
half
a
minute
later
who
should
come
walking
down
the
street
but
everett
secretary
i
thought
i
take
the
liberty
he
said
apologetically
i
thought
carpenter
might
say
something
worth
while
and
you
be
glad
to
have
a
transcript
of
his
why
that
very
kind
of
you
i
answered
i
did
know
you
were
interested
in
well
i
did
know
it
myself
but
i
seem
to
be
and
besides
he
told
me
to
follow
i
went
upstairs
and
found
the
stranger
waiting
in
the
room
where
i
had
left
him
i
put
myself
on
one
side
of
him
and
the
on
the
other
with
everett
respectfully
bringing
up
the
rear
and
so
we
walked
to
grant
hall
many
people
stared
at
us
and
a
few
followed
but
no
one
said
anything
and
thank
god
there
was
nothing
resembling
a
mob
i
took
my
prophet
to
the
stage
entrance
of
the
hall
and
got
him
into
the
wings
and
there
was
a
pathetically
earnest
lady
waiting
to
give
him
a
tract
on
the
horrors
of
vivisection
and
an
old
gentleman
with
a
white
beard
and
palsied
hands
inviting
him
to
a
spiritualistic
seance
funniest
of
all
there
was
aunt
caroline
prophet
the
author
of
the
eternal
bible
with
his
white
robes
and
his
permanent
wave
and
his
little
tribute
of
carrots
and
onions
wrapped
in
a
newspaper
i
decided
that
these
were
carpenter
own
kind
of
troubles
and
i
left
him
to
attend
to
them
and
strolled
out
to
have
a
look
at
the
audience
the
hall
was
packed
both
the
floor
and
the
galleries
there
must
have
been
three
thousand
people
i
noted
a
big
squad
of
police
and
wondered
what
was
coming
for
in
these
days
you
can
never
tell
whether
any
public
meeting
is
to
be
allowed
to
start
and
still
less
if
it
is
to
be
allowed
to
finish
however
the
crowd
was
orderly
the
only
disturber
being
some
kind
of
a
socialist
trying
to
sell
literature
i
saw
mary
magna
come
in
with
laura
lee
another
picture
actress
and
they
found
seats
and
i
looked
for
the
magnate
and
saw
him
talking
to
some
one
near
the
door
i
strolled
back
to
speak
to
him
and
recognized
the
other
man
as
westerly
secretary
of
the
merchants
and
manufacturers
association
i
knew
what
he
was
there
for
to
size
up
this
new
disturber
of
the
city
peace
and
perhaps
to
give
the
police
their
orders
it
was
not
my
wish
to
overhear
the
conversation
but
it
worked
out
that
way
partly
because
it
is
hard
not
to
overhear
and
partly
because
i
stopped
in
surprise
at
the
first
words
good
gawd
vesterly
vy
should
i
vant
to
give
money
to
strikers
dat
but
fool
newspaper

magna

me

vunderful

i
said

tousand

de
contract

one
of
the
strikers
who

been
in

a
fresh
young
fellow
proud
to
know
a
great
man

crowed
yet
that
man

the
magnate
pretended
not
to
understand
but
the
deep
flush
on
his
features
gave
him
away
how
westerly
i
said

role

i
shut
up
you
bet
xxxiii
the
chairman
of
the
meeting
was
a
man
named
brown
the
president
of
the
city
labor
council
he
was
certainly
respectable
enough
prosy
and
solemn
but
he
was
deeply
moved
on
this
question
of
clubbing
strikers
heads
and
you
could
see
that
the
crowd
was
only
waiting
for
a
chance
to
shout
its
indignation
the
chairman
introduced
the
president
of
the
restaurant
workers
a
solid
citizen
whom
you
would
have
taken
for
a
successful
grocer
he
told
about
what
had
happened
last
night
at
prince
and
then
he
told
about
the
causes
of
the
strike
and
the
things
that
go
on
behind
the
scenes
in
big
restaurants
i
had
been
to
prince
many
times
in
my
life
but
i
had
never
been
behind
the
scenes
nor
had
i
ever
before
been
to
a
i
must
admit
that
i
was
startled
the
things
they
put
into
the
hashes
and
the
distressing
habit
of
unorganized
waiters
when
robbed
of
their
tips
or
otherwise
to
take
it
out
by
spitting
into
the
soup
a
couple
of
other
labor
men
spoke
and
then
came
james
the
carpenter
with
a
religious
streak
he
had
a
harsh
rasping
voice
and
a
way
of
poking
a
long
bony
finger
at
the
people
he
was
impressing
he
was
desperately
in
earnest
and
it
caused
him
to
swallow
a
great
deal
and
each
time
his
adam
apple
would
jump
up
i
going
to
read
you
a
newspaper
clipping
he
began
and
i
thought
it
was
judge
wollcott
injunction
again
but
it
was
a
story
about
one
of
our
social
leaders
alinson
pakenham
who
has
four
famous
pekinese
spaniels
worth
six
thousand
dollars
each
and
weighing
only
eight
ounces
or
is
it
eighty
ounces
i
not
sure
for
i
never
was
trusted
to
lift
one
of
the
wretched
little
brutes
anyhow
their
names
are
fe
fi
fo
and
fum
and
they
have
each
their
own
attendant
and
the
four
have
a
private
limousine
in
which
to
travel
and
they
dine
off
a
service
of
gold
plate
and
here
were
hundreds
of
starving
strikers
with
their
wives
also
starving
and
a
couple
of
thousand
other
workers
in
factories
and
on
ranches
who
were
in
process
of
having
their
wages
the
orator
quoted
a
speech
of
algernon
de
wiggs
before
the
chamber
of
commerce
declaring
that
the
restoration
of
prosperity
especially
in
agriculture
depended
upon
deflation
and
this
alone
and
suddenly
james
the
carpenter
with
a
religious
streak
launched
forth
go
to
now
you
rich
men
weep
and
howl
for
your
miseries
that
are
coming
upon
you
your
riches
are
corrupted
and
your
garments
are
your
gold
and
silver
is
cankered
and
the
rust
on
it
shall
be
a
witness
against
you
and
shall
eat
your
flesh
as
if
it
were
fire
you
have
heaped
treasure
together
for
the
last
days
behold
the
hire
of
the
laborers
who
have
reaped
your
fields
you
have
kept
it
back
by
fraud
and
the
cries
of
the
reapers
have
entered
into
the
ears
of
the
lord
you
have
lived
in
pleasure
on
the
earth
and
been
wanton
you
have
nourished
your
hearts
as
in
a
day
of
slaughter
you
have
condemned
and
killed
the
just
at
this
point
in
the
tirade
my
old
friend
the
who
was
standing
in
the
wings
with
me
turned
and
whispered
for
sake
billy
what
kind
of
a
goddamn
bolshevik
stunt
is
this
anyhow
i
answered
hush
you
dub
he
quoting
from
the
bible
xxxiv
president
brown
of
the
western
city
labor
council
arose
to
perform
his
next
duty
as
chairman
said
he
the
next
speaker
is
a
stranger
to
most
of
you
and
he
is
also
a
stranger
to
me
i
do
not
know
what
his
doctrine
is
and
i
assume
no
responsibility
for
it
but
he
is
a
man
who
has
proven
his
friendship
for
labor
not
by
words
but
by
very
unusual
deeds
he
is
a
man
of
remarkable
personality
and
we
have
asked
him
to
make
what
suggestions
he
can
as
to
our
problems
i
have
pleasure
in
introducing
whereupon
the
prophet
fresh
from
god
arose
from
his
chair
and
come
slowly
to
the
front
of
the
platform
there
was
no
applause
but
a
silence
made
part
of
curiosity
and
part
of
amazement
his
figure
standing
thus
apart
was
majestic
and
i
noted
a
curious
thing
a
shining
as
of
light
about
his
head
it
was
so
clear
and
so
beautiful
that
i
whispered
to
old
joe
do
you
see
that
halo
go
on
billy
said
the
you
getting
nutty
but
it
plain
as
day
man
i
felt
some
one
touch
my
arm
and
saw
the
little
lady
of
the
tracts
peering
past
me
do
you
see
his
aura
she
whispered
excitedly
is
that
what
it
is
yes
it
purple
that
denotes
i
thought
to
myself
good
lord
am
i
getting
to
be
that
sort
carpenter
began
to
speak
quietly
in
his
grave
measured
voice
my
brothers
he
waited
for
some
time
as
if
that
were
enough
as
if
all
the
problems
of
life
would
be
solved
if
only
men
would
understand
those
two
words
my
brothers
i
am
as
your
chairman
says
a
stranger
to
this
world
of
yours
i
do
not
understand
your
vast
machines
and
your
complex
arts
but
i
know
the
souls
of
men
and
women
when
i
meet
greed
and
pride
and
cruelty
the
enslavements
of
the
flesh
they
can
not
lie
to
me
and
i
have
walked
about
the
streets
of
your
city
and
i
know
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
people
wandering
in
a
wilderness
my
children
desolate
and
betrayed
poorest
when
you
are
rich
loneliest
when
you
throng
together
proudest
when
you
are
most
ignorant
my
people
i
call
you
into
the
way
of
salvation
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
them
and
on
his
face
and
in
his
whole
look
was
such
anguish
that
i
think
there
was
no
man
in
that
whole
great
throng
so
rooted
in
that
he
was
not
shaken
with
sudden
awe
the
prophet
raised
his
hands
in
invocation
let
us
pray
he
bowed
his
head
and
many
in
the
audience
did
the
same
others
stared
at
him
in
bewilderment
having
long
ago
forgotten
how
to
pray
here
and
there
some
one
snickered
oh
god
our
father
we
thy
lost
children
return
to
thee
the
giver
of
life
we
bring
our
follies
and
our
greeds
and
cast
them
at
thy
feet
we
do
not
like
the
life
we
have
lived
we
wish
to
be
those
things
which
for
long
ages
we
have
dreamed
in
vain
wilt
thou
show
the
way
his
hands
sank
to
his
sides
and
he
raised
his
head
such
is
the
prayer
what
is
the
answer
it
has
been
made
known
ask
and
it
shall
be
given
you
seek
and
ye
shall
find
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
for
everyone
that
asketh
receiveth
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
these
are
ancient
words
by
many
forgotten
what
do
they
mean
they
mean
that
we
are
children
of
our
father
and
not
slaves
of
earthly
masters
would
a
man
make
a
slave
of
his
own
child
and
shall
man
be
more
righteous
than
his
creator
my
brothers
you
are
hungry
and
in
need
and
your
children
cry
for
bread
do
i
bid
you
feed
them
upon
words
not
so
but
the
life
of
men
is
made
by
the
will
of
men
and
that
which
exists
in
steel
and
stone
existed
first
in
thought
if
your
thought
is
mean
and
base
your
world
is
a
place
of
torment
if
your
thought
is
true
and
generous
your
world
is
free
there
was
once
a
man
who
owned
much
land
and
upon
it
he
built
great
factories
and
many
thousand
men
toiled
for
him
and
he
grew
fat
upon
the
product
of
their
labor
and
his
heart
was
high
and
it
came
to
pass
that
his
workers
rebelled
and
he
hired
others
and
they
shot
down
the
workers
so
that
the
rest
returned
to
their
labor
and
the
master
said
the
world
is
mine
and
none
can
oppose
me
but
one
day
there
arose
among
the
workers
a
man
who
laughed
and
his
laughter
spread
until
all
the
thousands
were
laughing
they
said
we
are
laughing
at
the
thought
that
we
should
work
and
you
take
the
fruit
of
our
labor
he
ordered
his
troops
to
shoot
them
but
his
troops
were
also
laughing
and
he
could
not
withstand
the
laughter
of
so
many
men
he
laughed
also
and
said
let
us
end
this
foolish
thing
is
there
a
man
among
you
who
can
say
i
am
worthy
of
freedom
that
man
shall
save
the
world
and
i
say
to
you
make
ready
your
hearts
for
brotherhood
for
the
hour
draws
near
and
it
is
a
shameful
thing
when
man
is
not
worthy
of
his
destiny
a
man
may
serve
with
his
body
and
yet
be
free
but
he
that
is
a
slave
in
his
soul
admires
the
symbols
of
mastery
and
lusts
after
its
fruits
what
are
the
fruits
of
mastery
they
are
pride
and
pomp
they
are
luxury
and
wantoness
and
the
shows
of
power
and
who
is
there
among
you
that
can
say
to
himself
these
things
have
no
roots
in
my
heart
that
man
is
great
and
the
deliverance
of
the
world
is
the
act
of
his
xxxv
the
speaker
paused
and
turned
his
gaze
swept
the
platform
and
those
seated
on
it
said
he
you
are
the
representatives
of
organized
labor
i
do
not
know
your
organization
therefore
i
ask
for
what
are
you
united
is
it
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
your
masters
and
bind
others
as
they
have
bound
you
he
waited
for
an
answer
and
the
chairman
upon
whom
his
gaze
was
fixed
cried
no
others
also
cried
no
and
the
audience
took
it
up
with
fervor
carpenter
turned
to
them
then
i
say
to
you
break
down
in
your
hearts
and
in
the
hearts
of
your
fellows
the
worship
of
those
base
things
which
mastership
has
brought
into
the
world
if
a
man
pile
up
food
while
others
starve
is
not
this
evil
if
a
woman
deck
herself
with
clothing
to
her
own
discomfort
is
not
this
folly
and
if
it
be
folly
how
shall
it
be
admired
by
you
to
whom
it
brings
starvation
and
despair
before
me
sit
young
women
of
the
working
class
say
to
yourselves
i
tear
from
my
fingers
the
jewels
which
are
the
blood
and
tears
of
my
i
wash
the
paint
from
my
face
and
from
my
head
and
my
bosom
i
take
the
silly
feathers
and
ribbons
i
dare
to
be
what
i
am
i
dare
to
speak
truth
in
a
world
of
lies
i
dare
to
deal
honestly
with
men
and
women
before
me
sit
young
men
of
the
i
say
to
you
love
honest
women
do
not
love
harlots
nor
imitations
of
harlots
do
not
admire
the
idle
women
of
the
ruling
class
nor
those
who
ape
them
and
thereby
glorify
them
do
not
admire
languid
limbs
and
pouting
lips
and
the
signs
of
haughtiness
and
vanity
your
own
enslavements
a
tree
is
known
by
the
fruit
it
gives
and
the
masters
are
known
by
the
lives
they
give
to
their
servants
they
are
known
by
misery
and
unemployment
by
plague
and
famine
by
wars
and
the
slaughter
of
the
people
let
judgment
be
pronounced
upon
them
you
have
heard
it
said
each
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
but
i
say
to
you
each
for
all
and
the
hindmost
is
your
charge
i
say
to
you
if
a
man
will
not
work
let
him
be
the
one
that
hungers
if
he
will
not
serve
let
him
be
your
criminal
for
if
one
man
be
idle
another
man
has
been
robbed
and
if
any
man
make
display
of
wealth
that
man
has
the
flesh
of
his
brothers
in
his
stomach
verily
he
that
lives
at
ease
while
others
starve
has
upon
him
and
he
that
despises
his
fellows
has
committed
the
sin
for
which
there
is
no
pardon
he
that
lives
for
his
own
glory
is
a
wolf
and
vengeance
will
hunt
him
down
but
he
that
loves
justice
and
mercy
and
labors
for
these
things
dwells
in
the
bosom
of
my
father
do
not
think
that
i
am
come
to
bring
you
ease
and
comfort
i
am
come
to
bring
strife
and
discontent
to
this
world
for
the
time
of
martyrdom
draws
near
and
from
your
father
alone
can
you
draw
the
strength
to
endure
your
trials
you
are
hungry
but
you
will
be
starved
you
are
prisoned
in
mills
and
mines
but
you
will
be
walled
up
in
dungeons
you
are
beaten
with
whips
but
you
will
be
beaten
with
clubs
your
flesh
will
be
torn
by
bullets
your
skin
will
be
burned
with
fire
and
your
lungs
poisoned
with
deadly
gases
such
is
the
dominion
of
this
world
but
i
say
to
you
resist
in
your
hearts
and
none
can
conquer
you
for
in
the
hearts
of
men
lies
the
past
and
the
future
and
there
is
no
power
but
love
you
say
the
world
is
evil
and
men
are
base
why
should
i
die
for
them
oh
ye
of
little
faith
how
many
have
died
for
you
and
would
you
cheat
mankind
if
there
is
to
be
goodness
in
the
world
some
one
must
begin
who
will
begin
with
me
my
brothers
i
am
come
to
lead
you
into
the
way
of
justice
i
bid
you
follow
not
in
passion
and
blind
excitement
but
as
men
firm
in
heart
and
bent
upon
service
for
the
way
of
is
easy
while
the
way
of
justice
is
hard
but
some
will
follow
and
their
numbers
will
grow
for
the
lives
of
men
have
grown
ill
beyond
enduring
and
there
must
be
a
new
birth
of
the
spirit
think
upon
my
message
i
shall
speak
to
you
again
and
the
compulsion
of
my
law
will
rest
upon
you
the
powers
of
this
world
come
to
an
end
but
the
power
of
good
will
is
everlasting
and
the
body
can
sooner
escape
from
its
own
shadow
than
mankind
can
escape
from
he
ceased
and
a
strange
thing
happened
half
the
crowd
rose
to
its
feet
and
they
cried
go
on
twice
he
tried
to
retire
to
his
seat
but
they
cried
go
on
go
on
said
he
my
brothers
this
is
not
my
meeting
there
are
other
speakers
but
they
cried
we
want
to
hear
you
he
answered
you
have
your
policies
to
decide
and
your
leaders
must
have
their
say
but
i
will
speak
to
you
again
i
am
told
that
your
city
permits
street
speaking
on
western
city
street
on
sundays
in
the
morning
i
am
going
to
church
to
see
how
they
worship
my
father
in
this
city
of
many
mobs
but
at
noon
i
will
hold
a
meeting
on
the
corner
of
fifth
and
western
city
streets
and
if
you
wish
you
may
hear
me
now
i
ask
you
to
excuse
me
for
i
am
he
stood
for
a
moment
and
i
saw
that
although
he
had
never
raised
his
voice
nor
made
a
violent
gesture
his
eyes
were
dark
and
hollow
with
fatigue
and
drops
of
sweat
stood
upon
his
forehead
he
turned
and
left
the
platform
and
old
joe
and
i
hurried
around
to
join
him
we
found
him
with
korwsky
the
little
russian
tailor
whose
son
he
had
healed
korwsky
claimed
him
to
spend
the
night
at
his
home
the
friend
with
the
delivery
wagon
was
on
hand
and
they
were
ready
to
start
i
asked
carpenter
to
what
church
he
was
going
in
the
morning
and
he
startled
me
by
the
reply
st
i
promised
that
i
would
surely
be
on
hand
and
then
old
joe
and
i
set
out
to
walk
home
well
said
i
what
do
you
think
of
him
the
walked
for
a
bit
before
he
answered
you
know
billy
boy
said
he
we
do
lead
rotten
useless
good
lord
i
thought
it
was
the
first
sign
of
a
soul
i
had
ever
noted
in
old
joe
why
i
argued
you
sell
paper
and
useful
is
it
i
do
know
whether
it
is
or
not
look
at
what
printed
on
it
mostly
advertisements
and
and
again
we
walked
for
a
bit
by
the
way
said
the
before
he
got
through
i
saw
that
aura
or
whatever
you
call
it
i
guess
i
getting
nutty
too
xxxvi
the
first
thing
i
did
on
sunday
morning
was
to
pick
up
the
western
city
times
to
see
what
it
had
done
to
carpenter
i
found
that
he
had
achieved
the
front
page
triple
column
with
streamer
head
all
the
way
across
the
page
prophet
in
town
heals
sick
raves
at
rich
america
is
mobland
alleged
in
red
riot
of
talk
there
followed
a
half
page
story
about
carpenter
strenuous
day
in
western
city
beginning
with
a
bolshevik
stump
speech
to
a
mob
of
striking
tailors
it
appears
that
the
prophet
had
gone
to
the
hebrew
quarter
of
the
city
and
finding
a
woman
railing
at
a
butcher
because
of
alleged
extortion
had
begun
a
speech
inciting
a
mob
so
that
the
police
reserves
had
to
be
called
out
and
a
riot
was
narrowly
averted
from
there
the
prophet
had
gone
to
the
labor
temple
announcing
himself
to
the
reporters
as
fresh
from
god
with
a
message
to
mobland
his
name
for
what
he
prophesied
america
would
be
under
his
rule
he
had
then
healed
a
sick
boy
the
performance
being
carefully
staged
in
front
of
moving
picture
cameras
the
account
of
the
times
did
not
directly
charge
that
the
performance
was
a
movie
stunt
but
it
described
it
in
a
mocking
way
which
made
it
obviously
that
the
paper
mentioned
in
such
a
way
as
to
indicate
him
as
the
originator
of
the
scheme
and
it
had
fun
with
mary
magna
pawning
her
paste
jewels
it
published
the
picture
and
also
a
picture
of
carpenter
walking
down
the
street
trailed
by
his
mob
in
another
column
was
the
climax
the
red
riot
of
talk
at
grant
hall
james
the
striking
carpenter
had
indulged
in
virulent
and
abuse
of
the
rich
after
which
the
new
prophet
had
stirred
the
mob
to
worse
frenzies
the
times
quoted
sample
sentences
such
as
do
not
think
that
i
am
come
to
bring
you
ease
and
comfort
i
am
come
to
bring
strife
and
disorder
to
this
i
turned
to
the
editorial
page
and
there
was
a
leader
made
extra
impressive
by
leads
an
infamous
blasphemy
was
the
heading
perhaps
you
have
a
times
in
your
own
city
if
so
you
will
no
doubt
recognize
the
standard
style
for
many
years
this
newspaper
has
been
pointing
out
to
the
people
of
western
city
the
accumulating
evidence
that
the
men
who
manipulate
the
forces
of
organized
labor
are
anarchists
at
heart
plotting
to
let
loose
the
torch
of
red
revolution
over
this
fair
land
we
have
clearly
showed
their
nefarious
purpose
to
overthrow
the
statue
of
liberty
and
set
up
in
its
place
the
dictatorship
of
the
walking
delegate
but
evil
as
we
thought
them
we
were
naive
enough
to
give
them
credit
for
an
elemental
sense
of
decency
even
though
they
had
no
respect
for
the
works
of
man
we
thought
at
least
they
would
spare
the
works
of
god
the
most
sacred
symbols
of
divine
revelation
to
suffering
humanity
but
yesterday
there
occurred
in
this
city
a
performance
which
for
shameless
insolence
and
blasphemous
perversion
exceeds
anything
but
the
wildest
flight
of
a
devil
imagination
and
reveals
the
bosses
of
the
labor
trust
as
wanton
defilers
of
everything
that
decent
people
hold
precious
and
holy
what
was
the
spectacle
a
moving
picture
producer
moved
by
blind
and
we
trust
unthinking
lust
for
gain
produces
in
our
midst
an
alleged
dressed
in
a
costume
elaborately
contrived
to
imitate
and
suggest
a
sacred
presence
which
our
respect
for
religion
forbids
us
to
name
he
brings
this
vile
perverted
creature
forward
announcing
himself
to
the
newspapers
as
from
god
and
mouthing
phrases
of
social
greed
and
jealousy
with
which
for
the
past
few
years
the
and
in
our
midst
have
made
us
only
too
sickenly
familiar
this
monstrous
parody
of
divine
compassion
is
escorted
to
that
headquarters
of
and
red
revolution
the
labor
temple
and
there
performs
in
the
presence
of
moving
picture
cameras
a
grotesque
parody
upon
the
laying
on
of
hands
and
the
healing
of
the
sick
the
presents
a
photograph
of
this
incredible
infamy
we
apologize
to
our
readers
for
thus
aiding
the
designs
of
cunning
but
there
is
no
other
way
to
make
clear
to
the
public
the
gross
affront
to
decency
which
has
been
perpetrated
and
the
further
affronts
which
are
being
planned
this
appears
to
be
a
scheme
for
making
a
moving
picture
this
note
the
silly
pun
is
to
become
the
latest
sensation
in
million
dollar
movie
dolls
and
the
american
public
is
to
be
invited
to
pay
money
to
witness
a
story
of
sacred
things
played
by
a
real
and
worker
of
but
the
worst
has
yet
to
be
told
the
masters
of
the
labor
trust
not
to
be
outdone
in
bidding
for
unholy
notoriety
had
the
insolence
to
invite
this
blasphemous
charlatan
to
their
riot
of
revolutionary
ranting
called
a
meeting
he
and
other
creatures
of
his
ilk
summoning
the
forces
which
are
organizing
red
ruin
in
our
city
proceed
to
rave
at
the
police
and
the
courts
for
denying
to
mobs
of
strikers
the
right
to
throw
brickbats
at
honest
workers
looking
for
jobs
and
to
hold
the
pistol
of
the
boycott
at
the
heads
of
employers
who
dare
to
stand
for
american
liberty
and
democracy
we
have
heard
much
mouthing
of
class
venom
and
hate
in
this
community
but
never
have
our
ears
been
affronted
by
anything
so
unpardonable
as
this
disguising
of
the
doctrine
of
lenin
and
trotsky
in
the
robes
of
christian
revelation
this
fresh
from
god
as
he
styles
himself
is
a
man
of
peace
and
brotherly
love
oh
yes
of
course
we
know
these
wolves
in
sheeps
clothing
these
pacifists
and
lovers
of
man
with
the
gold
of
the
red
international
in
their
pockets
and
slavering
from
their
tongues
the
fine
phrases
of
idealism
which
conveniently
protect
them
from
the
strong
hand
of
the
law
we
have
seen
their
bloody
work
for
four
years
in
russia
and
we
tell
them
that
if
they
expect
to
prepare
the
confiscation
of
property
and
the
nationalization
of
women
in
this
country
while
disguising
themselves
in
moving
picture
imitations
of
religion
they
are
grossly
underestimating
the
intelligence
of
the
citizens
of
this
great
republic
we
shall
be
much
mistaken
if
the
and
patriotic
people
of
our
christian
community
do
not
find
a
way
to
stamp
their
heel
upon
this
vile
viper
before
its
venom
shall
have
poisoned
the
air
we
xxxvii
then
i
picked
up
the
our
examiner
does
not
go
in
so
much
for
moral
causes
it
is
more
interested
in
getting
circulation
for
which
it
relies
upon
sensation
and
especially
what
it
calls
heart
interest
meaning
sex
it
had
found
what
it
wanted
in
this
story
as
you
may
judge
by
the
headlines
movie
queen
pawns
jewels
for
prophet
of
god
then
followed
a
story
of
which
mary
magna
was
the
centre
with
and
myself
for
background
the
reporter
had
hunted
out
the
mexican
family
with
which
carpenter
had
spent
the
night
and
he
drew
a
touching
picture
of
carpenter
praying
over
mary
in
this
humble
home
and
converting
her
to
a
better
life
would
the
million
dollar
vamp
as
the
examiner
called
her
now
take
to
playing
only
religious
parts
mary
was
noncommittal
on
the
point
and
pending
her
decision
the
examiner
published
her
portraits
in
half
a
dozen
of
her
most
luxurious
roles
for
example
as
salome
after
taking
off
the
seventh
veil
side
by
side
with
carpenter
that
had
a
real
punch
you
may
believe
the
telephone
rang
and
there
was
the
voice
of
fairly
raving
he
did
mind
the
examiner
stuff
that
was
good
business
but
that
in
the
times
he
was
going
to
sue
the
times
for
a
million
dollars
by
god
and
would
i
back
him
in
his
claim
that
he
had
not
put
carpenter
up
to
the
healing
business
after
a
bit
the
magnate
began
apologizing
for
his
repudiation
of
the
prophet
he
was
in
a
position
just
now
with
these
hard
times
where
the
wall
street
crowd
could
ruin
him
if
he
got
in
bad
with
them
and
then
he
told
me
a
curious
story
last
night
after
the
meeting
young
everett
his
secretary
had
come
to
him
and
asked
if
he
could
have
a
couple
of
months
leave
of
absence
without
pay
he
was
so
much
interested
in
carpenter
that
he
wanted
to
follow
him
and
help
him
y
know
billy
said
the
voice
over
the
phone
y
could
knocked
me
over
vit
a
fedder
dat
young
feller
he
vas
alvays
so
quiet
and
such
a
fine
business
feller
i
put
him
in
charge
of
all
my
collections
i
said
to
him

and
he
said
gon

from
mr
carpenter
says
i
you
gon
na

and
he
says
gon
na
learn
to
be
a
better
man
den
he
vaits
a
minute
and
he
says
he
me
to
foller
him
j
ever
hear
de
like
o
dat
what
did
you
say
vot
could
i
say
i
vanted
to
say
givin
you
de
orders
but
i
could
somehow
i
hadda
tell
him
to
go
ahead
and
come
back
before
he
forgot
all
my
i
dressed
and
had
my
breakfast
and
drove
to
bartholomew
it
was
a
november
morning
bright
and
sunny
as
warm
as
summer
and
it
is
always
such
a
pleasure
to
see
that
goodly
company
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
so
perfectly
groomed
so
perfectly
mannered
breathing
a
sense
of
peace
and
well
being
ah
that
wonderful
sense
of
well
being
god
in
his
heaven
all
right
with
the
world
and
what
a
curious
contrast
with
the
labor
temple
for
a
moment
i
doubted
carpenter
surely
these
ladies
with
their
decorative
bonnets
their
sweet
perfumes
their
gowns
of
rose
and
lilac
and
other
pastel
shades
surely
they
were
more
important
than
women
in
frowsy
and
dowdy
imitation
clothes
surely
it
was
better
to
be
serene
and
clean
and
pleasant
than
to
be
terrible
and
bewildered
sick
and
quarrelsome
i
was
seized
by
a
frenzy
a
sort
of
instinctive
animal
lust
for
this
life
of
ease
and
prettiness
no
matter
if
those
dirty
hordes
of
strikers
and
others
of
their
ilk
as
the
times
phrased
it
did
have
to
wash
my
clothes
and
scrub
my
floors
just
so
that
stayed
clean
and
decent
i
bowed
to
a
score
or
two
of
the
elegant
ladies
and
to
their
escorts
in
shiny
top
hats
and
uncreased
kid
gloves
and
went
into
the
exquisite
church
with
its
glowing
stained
glass
window
and
looked
up
over
the
altar
and
there
stood
carpenter
i
tell
you
it
gave
me
a
queer
shock
there
he
was
up
in
the
window
exactly
where
he
had
always
been
i
thought
i
had
suddenly
wakened
from
a
dream
there
had
been
no
prophet
fresh
from
god
no
at
grant
hall
no
editorial
in
the
times
but
suddenly
i
heard
a
voice
at
my
elbow
billy
what
is
this
awful
thing
you
been
doing
it
was
my
aunt
caroline
and
i
asked
what
she
meant
and
she
answered
that
terrible
prophet
creature
and
getting
your
name
into
the
papers
so
i
knew
it
was
true
and
i
walked
with
my
dear
sweet
old
auntie
down
the
aisle
and
there
sat
aunt
jennie
with
her
two
lanky
girls
who
have
grown
inches
every
time
i
run
into
them
and
also
uncle
timothy
uncle
timothy
was
my
guardian
until
i
came
of
age
so
i
am
a
little
in
awe
of
him
and
now
i
had
to
listen
to
his
whispered
reproaches
it
being
the
first
principle
of
our
family
never
to
get
into
the
i
told
him
that
it
was
my
fault
i
had
been
knocked
down
by
a
mob
and
surely
i
could
help
it
if
this
man
carpenter
found
me
while
i
was
unconscious
and
made
me
well
nor
could
i
fail
to
be
polite
to
my
benefactor
and
try
to
help
him
about
my
uncle
timothy
was
amazed
because
he
had
accepted
the
times
story
that
it
was
all
a
movie
hoax
everybody
will
tell
you
in
western
city
that
they
never
believe
a
word
they
read
in
the
but
of
course
they
do
they
have
to
believe
something
and
what
else
have
they
i
was
trying
to
think
about
that
picture
over
the
altar
of
course
they
would
naturally
have
replaced
it
i
wondered
who
had
found
old
de
wiggs
up
there
i
wondered
if
he
knew
about
it
and
if
he
had
any
idea
who
had
played
that
prank
i
looked
to
his
pew
yes
there
he
sat
rosy
and
beaming
bland
as
ever
i
looked
for
old
peter
dexter
president
of
the
dexter
trust
company
yes
he
was
in
his
pew
wizened
and
hunched
up
prematurely
bald
and
stuyvesant
gunning
of
the
fidelity
national
they
were
all
here
the
masters
of
the
finance
and
the
pillars
of
law
and
some
wag
had
remarked
if
you
wanted
to
call
directors
meeting
after
the
service
you
could
settle
all
the
business
of
western
city
in
bartholomew
the
organ
pealed
and
the
choir
marched
in
bearing
the
golden
crosses
and
followed
by
the
reverend
plump
and
beautiful
his
eyes
bent
reverently
on
the
floor
they
were
singing
with
fervor
that
most
orthodox
of
hymns
the
church
one
foundation
is
jesus
christ
her
lord
it
is
a
beautiful
old
service
as
you
may
know
and
i
had
been
taught
to
love
it
and
thrill
to
it
as
a
little
child
and
we
never
forget
those
things
peace
and
propriety
are
its
keynotes
order
and
dignity
combined
with
sensuous
charm
everyone
knows
his
part
and
it
moves
along
like
a
beautiful
machine
i
knelt
and
prayed
and
then
sat
and
listened
and
then
stood
and
sang
over
and
over
for
perhaps
of
an
hour
we
came
to
the
hymn
which
precedes
the
sermon
and
turning
to
the
number
we
obediently
proclaimed
the
son
of
god
goes
forth
to
war
a
kingly
crown
to
gain
his
banner
streams
afar
who
follows
in
his
train
during
the
singing
of
the
last
verse
the
reverend
had
moved
silently
into
the
pulpit
after
the
choir
had
sung
amen
he
raised
his
hands
in
invocation
and
at
that
awesome
moment
i
saw
carpenter
come
striding
up
the
aisle
xxxviii
he
knew
just
where
he
was
going
and
walked
so
fast
that
before
anyone
had
time
to
realize
what
was
happening
he
was
on
the
altar
steps
and
facing
the
congregation
you
could
hear
the
gasp
of
amazement
he
was
so
absolutely
identical
with
the
painted
figure
over
his
head
that
if
he
had
remained
still
you
could
not
have
told
which
was
painting
and
which
was
flesh
and
blood
the
rector
in
the
pulpit
stood
with
his
mouth
open
staring
as
if
seeing
a
ghost
the
prophet
stretched
out
both
his
hands
and
pointed
two
accusing
fingers
at
the
congregation
his
voice
rang
out
stern
and
commanding
let
this
mockery
cease
again
he
cried
what
do
ye
with
my
name
and
pointing
over
his
head
ye
crucify
me
in
stained
glass
there
came
murmurs
from
the
congregation
the
first
mutterings
of
a
storm
oh
outrageous
blasphemy
blasphemy
cried
carpenter
is
it
not
written
that
god
dwelleth
not
in
temples
made
with
hands
ye
have
built
a
temple
to
mammon
and
defile
the
name
of
my
father
therein
the
storm
grew
louder
this
is
preposterous
exclaimed
my
uncle
timothy
at
my
side
and
the
reverend
managed
to
find
his
voice
sir
whoever
you
are
leave
this
church
carpenter
turned
upon
him
you
give
orders
to
me
you
who
have
brought
back
the
moneychangers
into
my
father
temple
and
suddenly
he
faced
the
congregation
crying
in
a
voice
of
wrath
algernon
de
wiggs
stand
up
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
banker
rose
in
his
pew
whether
under
the
spell
of
carpenter
majestic
presence
or
preparing
to
rush
at
him
and
throw
him
out
i
could
not
be
sure
the
great
banker
face
was
vivid
scarlet
and
carpenter
pointed
to
another
part
of
the
congregation
peter
dexter
stand
up
the
president
of
the
dexter
trust
company
also
arose
trembling
as
if
with
palsy
mumbling
something
one
could
not
tell
whether
protest
or
apology
stuyvesant
gunning
stand
up
and
the
president
of
the
fidelity
national
obeyed
apparently
carpenter
proposed
to
call
the
whole
roll
of
financial
directors
but
the
procedure
was
halted
suddenly
as
a
tall
figure
strode
from
its
seat
near
the
choir
young
sidney
simpkinson
assistant
to
the
rector
went
up
to
carpenter
and
took
him
by
the
arm
leave
this
house
of
god
he
commanded
the
other
faced
him
it
is
written
thou
shalt
not
take
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
vain
for
the
lord
will
not
hold
him
guiltless
that
taketh
his
name
in
young
simpkinson
wasted
no
further
words
in
parley
he
was
an
advocate
of
what
is
known
as
muscular
christianity
and
kept
himself
in
trim
playing
on
the
parish
team
he
flung
his
strong
arms
about
carpenter
and
half
carrying
him
half
walking
him
took
him
down
the
steps
and
down
the
aisle
as
he
went
carpenter
was
proclaiming
it
is
written
my
house
shall
be
called
a
house
of
prayer
but
ye
have
made
it
a
den
of
thieves
he
that
steals
little
is
called
a
pickpocket
but
he
that
steals
much
is
called
a
pillar
of
the
church
verily
he
that
deprives
the
laborer
of
the
fruit
of
his
toil
is
more
dangerous
than
he
that
robs
upon
the
highway
and
he
that
steals
the
state
and
the
powers
of
government
is
the
father
of
all
by
that
time
the
prophet
had
been
hustled
down
the
aisle
and
then
came
a
new
development
unobserved
by
anyone
a
number
of
carpenter
followers
had
come
with
him
into
the
church
and
these
seeing
the
way
he
was
being
handled
set
up
a
cry
for
shame
for
shame
i
saw
everett
secretary
to
and
korwsky
secretary
of
the
tailor
union
i
saw
some
one
leap
at
everett
and
strike
him
a
ferocious
blow
in
the
teeth
and
two
other
men
leap
upon
the
little
russian
and
hurl
him
to
the
ground
i
started
up
involuntarily
oh
shame
shame
i
cried
and
would
have
rushed
out
into
the
aisle
but
i
had
to
pass
my
uncle
and
he
had
no
intention
of
letting
me
make
myself
a
spectacle
he
threw
his
arms
about
me
and
pinned
me
against
the
pew
in
front
and
as
he
is
one
of
the
ten
ranking
golfers
at
the
western
city
country
club
his
embrace
carried
authority
i
struggled
but
there
i
stayed
shouting
for
shame
for
shame
and
my
uncle
exclaiming
in
a
stern
whisper
shut
up
sit
down
you
fool
and
my
aunt
caroline
holding
onto
my
crying
and
my
aunt
jennie
threatening
to
faint
the
melee
came
quickly
to
an
end
for
the
men
of
the
congregation
seized
the
half
dozen
disturbers
and
flung
them
outside
and
mounted
guard
to
make
sure
they
did
not
return
i
sank
back
into
my
seat
my
worthy
uncle
holding
my
arm
tightly
with
both
hands
lest
i
should
try
to
make
my
escape
over
the
laps
of
aunt
caroline
and
aunt
jennie
all
this
time
the
reverend
had
been
standing
in
the
pulpit
making
no
sound
now
as
the
congregation
settled
back
into
order
he
said
with
the
splendid
conscious
of
one
who
can
remain
equal
to
the
occasion
we
will
resume
the
and
he
opened
his
portfolio
and
spread
out
his
manuscript
before
him
and
announced
our
text
for
the
morning
is
the
fifth
chapter
of
the
gospel
according
to
matthew
the
and
fortieth
verses
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
resist
not
evil
but
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
cheek
turn
to
him
the
other
also
and
if
any
man
shall
sue
thee
at
law
and
take
away
thy
coat
let
him
have
thy
cloak
xxxix
i
sat
through
the
sermon
and
the
offertory
and
the
recessional
after
that
my
uncle
tried
to
detain
me
to
warn
and
scold
me
but
he
no
longer
used
physical
force
and
nothing
but
that
would
have
held
me
at
the
door
i
asked
one
of
the
ushers
what
had
become
of
the
prophet
thinking
he
might
be
in
jail
but
the
answer
was
that
the
gang
had
gone
off
carrying
their
wounded
so
i
ran
round
the
corner
to
where
my
car
was
parked
and
within
ten
minutes
i
was
on
western
city
street
where
carpenter
had
announced
that
he
would
speak
there
had
been
nothing
said
about
the
proposed
meeting
in
the
papers
and
no
one
knew
about
it
save
those
who
had
been
present
at
grant
hall
but
it
looked
as
if
they
had
told
everyone
they
knew
and
everyone
they
had
told
had
come
the
wide
street
was
packed
solid
for
a
block
and
in
the
midst
of
this
throng
stood
carpenter
upon
a
wagon
making
a
speech
there
was
no
chance
to
get
near
so
i
bethought
me
of
an
alley
which
ran
parallel
to
the
street
there
was
an
obscure
hotel
on
the
street
and
i
entered
it
through
the
rear
entrance
and
had
no
trouble
in
persuading
the
clerk
to
let
me
join
some
of
the
guests
of
the
hotel
who
were
watching
the
scene
from
the
second
story
windows
the
first
thing
which
caught
my
attention
was
the
figure
of
everett
seated
on
the
floor
of
the
wagon
from
which
the
speech
was
being
made
i
saw
that
his
face
was
covered
with
blood
i
learned
later
that
he
had
three
teeth
knocked
out
and
his
nose
broken
nevertheless
there
he
was
with
his
stenographer
notebook
taking
down
the
prophet
words
he
told
me
afterwards
that
he
had
taken
even
what
carpenter
said
in
the
church
i
an
idea
he
wo
last
very
long
was
the
way
he
put
it
and
if
they
should
get
rid
of
him
every
word
he
said
will
be
precious
anyhow
i
going
to
get
what
i
also
i
saw
korwsky
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
wagon
evidently
knocked
out
and
two
other
men
whom
i
did
not
know
nursing
battered
and
bloody
faces
having
taken
all
that
in
at
a
glance
i
gave
my
attention
to
what
carpenter
was
saying
he
was
discussing
churches
and
those
who
attend
them
later
on
my
attention
was
called
to
the
curious
fact
that
his
discourse
was
merely
a
translation
into
modern
american
of
portions
of
the
chapter
of
matthew
a
free
adaptation
of
those
ancient
words
to
present
day
practices
and
conditions
but
i
had
no
idea
of
this
while
i
listened
i
was
shocked
by
what
seemed
to
me
a
furious
tirade
and
the
guests
of
the
hotel
were
even
more
shocked
i
think
they
would
have
taken
to
throwing
things
out
of
the
windows
at
the
orator
had
it
not
been
for
their
fear
of
the
crowd
said
carpenter
the
theologians
and
scholars
and
the
pious
laymen
fill
the
leisure
class
churches
and
it
would
be
all
right
if
you
were
to
listen
to
what
they
preach
and
do
that
but
do
follow
their
actions
for
they
never
practice
what
they
preach
they
load
the
backs
of
the
with
crushing
burdens
but
they
themselves
never
move
a
finger
to
carry
a
burden
and
everything
they
do
is
for
show
they
wear
and
silk
hats
on
sundays
and
they
sit
at
the
speakers
tables
at
the
banquets
of
the
civic
federation
and
they
occupy
the
best
pews
in
the
churches
and
their
doings
are
reported
in
all
the
papers
they
are
called
leading
citizens
and
pillars
of
the
church
but
do
you
be
called
leading
citizens
for
the
only
useful
man
is
the
man
who
produces
applause
and
whoever
exalts
himself
shall
be
abased
and
whoever
humbles
himself
shall
be
exalted
woe
unto
you
doctors
of
divinity
and
catholics
hypocrites
for
you
shut
up
the
kingdom
of
heaven
against
men
you
do
go
in
yourself
and
you
do
let
others
go
in
woe
unto
you
doctors
of
divinity
and
presbyterians
hypocrites
for
you
foreclose
mortgages
on
widows
houses
and
for
a
pretense
you
make
long
prayers
for
this
you
will
receive
the
greater
damnation
woe
unto
you
doctors
of
divinity
and
methodists
hypocrites
for
you
send
missionaries
to
africa
to
make
one
convert
and
when
you
have
made
him
is
twice
as
much
a
child
of
hell
as
yourselves
applause
woe
unto
you
blind
guides
with
your
subtleties
of
doctrine
your
transubstantiation
and
consubstantiation
and
all
the
rest
of
it
you
fools
and
blind
woe
unto
you
doctors
of
divity
and
episcopalians
hypocrites
for
you
drop
your
checks
into
the
and
you
pay
no
heed
to
the
really
important
things
in
the
bible
which
are
justice
and
mercy
and
faith
in
goodness
you
blind
guides
who
choke
over
a
fly
and
swallow
a
flivver
laughter
woe
unto
you
doctors
of
divinity
and
anglicans
hypocrites
for
you
dress
in
immaculate
clothing
kept
clean
by
the
toil
of
frail
women
but
within
you
are
full
of
extortion
and
excess
you
blind
high
churchmen
clean
first
your
hearts
so
that
the
clothes
you
wear
may
represent
you
woe
unto
you
doctors
of
divinity
and
baptists
hypocrites
for
you
are
like
marble
tombs
which
appear
beautiful
on
the
outside
but
inside
are
full
of
dead
men
bones
and
all
uncleanness
even
so
you
appear
righteous
to
men
but
inside
you
are
full
of
hypocrisy
and
iniquity
applause
woe
unto
you
doctors
of
divinity
and
unitarians
hypocrites
because
you
erect
statues
to
dead
reformers
and
put
wreaths
upon
the
tombs
of
martyrs
you
say
if
we
had
been
alive
in
those
days
we
would
not
have
helped
to
kill
those
good
men
that
ought
to
show
you
how
to
treat
us
at
present
laughter
but
you
are
the
children
of
those
who
killed
the
good
men
so
go
ahead
and
kill
us
too
you
serpents
you
generation
of
vipers
how
can
you
escape
the
damnation
of
hell
xl
when
carpenter
stopped
speaking
his
face
was
dripping
with
sweat
and
he
was
pale
but
the
eager
crowd
would
not
let
him
go
they
began
to
ask
him
questions
there
were
some
who
wanted
to
know
what
he
meant
by
saying
that
he
came
from
god
and
some
who
wanted
to
know
whether
he
believed
in
the
christian
religion
there
were
others
who
wanted
to
know
what
he
thought
about
political
action
and
if
he
really
believed
that
the
capitalists
would
give
up
without
using
force
there
was
a
man
who
had
been
at
the
relief
kitchen
and
noted
that
he
ate
soup
with
meat
in
it
and
asked
if
this
was
not
using
force
against
one
fellow
creatures
the
old
gentleman
who
represented
spiritualism
was
on
hand
asking
if
the
dead
are
still
alive
and
if
so
where
are
they
then
before
the
meeting
was
over
there
came
a
sick
man
to
be
healed
and
others
pushing
their
way
through
the
crowd
clamoring
about
the
wagon
seeking
even
to
touch
the
hem
of
garments
after
a
couple
of
hours
of
this
he
announced
that
he
was
worn
out
but
it
was
a
problem
to
get
the
wagon
started
they
could
only
move
slowly
the
driver
calling
to
the
people
in
front
to
make
room
so
they
went
down
the
street
and
i
got
into
my
car
and
followed
at
a
distance
i
did
not
know
where
they
were
going
and
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
but
creep
along
a
poor
little
rich
boy
with
a
big
automobile
and
nobody
to
ride
in
it
or
to
pay
any
attention
to
him
the
wagon
drove
to
the
city
jail
which
rather
gave
me
a
start
because
i
had
been
thinking
that
the
party
might
be
arrested
at
any
minute
on
complaint
to
the
police
from
the
church
but
apparently
this
did
not
trouble
carpenter
he
wished
to
visit
the
strikers
who
had
been
arrested
in
front
of
prince
restaurant
he
and
several
others
stood
before
the
heavy
barred
doors
asking
for
admission
while
a
big
crowd
gathered
and
stared
i
sat
watching
the
scene
with
phrases
learned
in
earliest
childhood
floating
through
my
mind
i
was
sick
and
ye
visited
me
i
was
in
prison
and
ye
came
unto
but
it
appeared
that
sunday
was
not
visitors
day
at
the
jail
and
the
little
company
was
turned
away
as
they
climbed
back
into
the
wagon
i
saw
two
husky
fellows
come
from
the
jail
a
type
one
learns
to
know
as
plain
clothes
men
why
wo
they
let
him
in
cried
some
one
in
the
crowd
and
one
of
the
detectives
looked
over
his
shoulder
with
a
sneering
laugh
we
let
him
in
before
long
do
you
worry
the
wagon
took
up
its
slow
march
again
it
was
a
belonging
as
i
afterwards
learned
to
a
compatriot
of
korwsky
the
tailor
this
man
simon
karlin
earned
a
meager
living
for
himself
and
his
family
by
miscellaneous
delivery
in
his
neighborhood
but
now
he
was
so
fascinated
with
carpenter
that
he
had
dropped
everything
in
order
to
carry
the
prophet
about
i
mention
it
because
next
day
in
the
newspapers
there
was
much
fun
made
of
this
imitation
man
of
god
riding
about
town
in
a
half
hauled
by
a
rickety
and
spavined
old
nag
the
company
drove
to
one
of
the
poorer
quarters
of
the
city
and
stopped
before
a
workingman
cottage
on
a
street
whose
name
i
had
never
heard
before
i
learned
that
it
was
the
home
of
james
the
striking
carpenter
and
on
the
steps
were
his
wife
and
a
brood
of
half
a
dozen
children
and
his
old
father
and
mother
and
several
other
people
unidentified
there
were
many
who
had
walked
all
the
way
following
the
wagon
and
others
gathered
quickly
and
besought
the
prophet
to
speak
to
them
and
to
heal
their
sick
apparently
his
whole
life
was
to
consist
of
that
kind
of
thing
for
he
found
it
hard
to
refuse
any
request
but
finally
he
told
them
he
must
be
quiet
and
went
inside
and
james
mounted
guard
at
the
door
and
i
sat
in
my
car
and
waited
until
the
crowd
had
filtered
away
there
was
no
good
reason
why
i
should
have
been
admitted
but
james
apparently
was
glad
to
see
me
and
let
me
join
the
little
company
that
was
gathered
in
his
home
there
was
everett
who
had
now
washed
the
blood
off
his
face
but
had
not
been
able
to
put
back
his
lost
teeth
nor
to
heal
the
swollen
mass
that
had
once
been
his
upper
lip
and
nose
and
there
was
korwsky
who
was
now
able
to
sit
up
and
smile
feebly
and
two
other
men
whose
names
i
did
not
learn
nursing
battered
faces
carpenter
prayed
over
them
all
and
they
became
more
cheerful
and
eager
to
talk
about
the
adventure
each
telling
over
what
had
happened
to
him
i
noted
that
everett
in
spite
of
what
must
have
been
intense
pain
was
still
faithfully
taking
down
every
word
the
prophet
uttered
it
had
been
known
that
carpenter
was
to
honor
this
house
with
his
presence
and
the
family
were
all
dressed
in
their
best
and
had
got
together
a
supper
in
spite
of
hard
times
and
strikes
we
had
sandwiches
and
iced
tea
and
a
slice
of
pie
for
each
of
us
and
i
was
interested
to
observe
that
the
prophet
tired
as
he
was
liked
to
laugh
and
chat
over
his
food
exactly
like
any
uninspired
human
being
he
never
failed
to
get
the
children
around
him
and
tell
them
stories
and
hear
their
bright
laughter
xli
but
of
course
serious
things
kept
intruding
karlin
the
express
driver
had
a
sick
wife
and
carpenter
heard
about
her
and
insisted
upon
going
to
see
her
apparently
there
was
no
end
to
this
business
of
the
poor
being
sick
it
was
a
new
thing
to
me
this
world
swarming
with
dirty
and
miserable
and
distracted
people
of
course
i
had
known
about
the
poor
but
always
either
in
the
abstract
or
else
as
an
individual
or
a
family
that
one
could
help
but
here
was
a
new
world
thickly
peopled
swarming
that
was
the
terrible
part
of
it
the
vastness
of
it
the
thickness
of
the
population
in
these
regions
of
the
it
was
like
some
sort
of
delirium
like
being
lost
in
a
wilderness
of
which
the
trees
were
miseries
and
deformities
and
pains
i
could
understand
to
the
full
feeling
when
he
put
his
hands
to
his
forehead
exclaiming
there
is
so
much
to
do
and
so
few
to
do
it
pray
to
god
that
he
will
send
some
to
help
us
when
he
returned
from
simon
karlin
he
brought
with
him
the
latter
wife
whom
he
had
healed
of
a
fever
and
here
was
another
of
the
company
whom
he
insisted
upon
helping
comrade
abell
one
of
the
men
i
had
noticed
at
the
meeting
last
night
and
who
appeared
to
be
done
up
this
man
i
learned
was
secretary
of
the
socialist
local
of
western
city
i
had
known
there
were
socialists
in
the
city
just
as
i
knew
there
were
poor
but
i
had
never
seen
one
and
was
curious
about
abell
he
was
a
lawyer
and
that
might
suggest
to
you
a
certain
type
of
person
brisk
and
well
dressed
but
apparently
socialist
lawyers
are
not
true
to
type
comrade
abell
was
a
shy
timid
little
man
with
black
hair
straggling
about
his
ears
and
sometimes
into
his
eyes
he
had
a
gentle
pathetic
face
and
his
voice
was
melancholy
and
caressing
he
was
clad
in
a
frock
coat
of
black
broadcloth
which
had
once
been
appropriate
for
sunday
but
i
should
judge
it
had
been
worn
for
twenty
years
for
it
was
green
about
the
collar
and
the
cuffs
and
comrade
abell
office
and
also
his
home
were
in
a
second
story
over
a
in
this
neighborhood
and
here
also
was
a
little
hall
used
as
a
by
the
socialists
every
saturday
night
abell
and
two
or
three
of
his
friends
conducted
a
meeting
on
western
city
street
and
gave
away
propaganda
leaflets
and
sold
a
few
pamphlets
and
books
he
had
had
quite
a
supply
of
literature
of
all
kinds
at
his
office
nearly
two
thousand
dollars
worth
he
told
carpenter
but
a
few
months
previously
the
place
had
been
mobbed
a
band
of
men
accompanied
by
a
few
police
and
detectives
had
raided
it
and
terrified
the
wife
and
children
by
breaking
down
the
doors
and
throwing
the
contents
of
desks
and
bureaus
out
on
the
floor
they
had
dumped
the
literature
into
a
truck
and
carted
it
away
and
after
two
or
three
weeks
they
had
dumped
it
back
again
having
found
nothing
criminal
in
it
but
they
ruined
it
so
that
it
ca
be
sold
broke
in
james
indignantly
most
of
it
was
bought
on
credit
and
how
can
we
pay
for
james
was
also
a
socialist
it
appeared
while
korwsky
and
his
friend
karlin
advocated
industrial
action
and
these
fell
to
arguing
over
tactics
while
carpenter
asked
questions
so
as
to
understand
their
different
points
of
view
presently
korwsky
was
called
out
of
the
room
and
came
back
with
an
announcement
which
he
evidently
considered
grave
john
colver
was
in
the
neighborhood
and
wanted
to
know
if
carpenter
would
meet
him
who
is
john
colver
asked
the
prophet
and
it
was
explained
that
this
was
a
dangerous
agitator
now
under
sentence
of
twenty
years
in
jail
but
out
on
bail
pending
the
appeal
of
his
case
to
the
supreme
court
colver
was
a
wobbly
well
known
as
one
of
their
poets
said
korwsky
he
tinks
you
vould
like
to
know
him
because
if
de
spies
find
it
out
dey
vould
git
after
i
will
meet
any
man
said
carpenter
my
business
is
to
meet
and
so
in
a
few
minutes
the
terrible
john
colver
was
escorted
into
the
room
now
every
once
in
a
while
i
had
read
in
the
times
how
another
bunch
of
these
were
put
on
trial
and
how
they
were
insolent
to
the
judge
and
how
it
was
proved
they
had
committed
many
crimes
and
how
they
were
sentenced
to
fourteen
years
in
prison
under
our
criminal
syndicalism
act
needless
to
say
i
had
never
seen
one
of
these
desperate
men
but
i
had
a
quite
definite
idea
what
they
looked
like
dark
and
sinister
creatures
with
twisted
mouths
and
furtive
eyes
i
knew
that
because
i
had
seen
a
couple
of
moving
picture
shows
in
which
they
figured
but
now
for
the
first
time
i
met
one
and
behold
he
was
an
laughing
lad
with
apple
cheeks
and
two
most
beautiful
rows
of
even
white
teeth
that
gleamed
at
you
carpenter
he
cried
and
caught
the
prophet
by
his
two
hands
you
are
an
old
friend
of
ours
though
you
may
not
know
it
we
drink
a
toast
to
you
in
our
is
that
so
said
carpenter
i
suppose
i
really
have
no
right
to
see
you
continued
the
other
because
i
shadowed
all
the
time
and
you
know
my
organization
is
why
is
it
outlawed
well
said
colver
they
say
we
burn
crops
and
barns
and
drive
into
and
spikes
into
sawmill
and
do
you
do
that
colver
laughed
his
merry
laugh
we
do
it
just
as
often
as
you
act
for
the
movies
carpenter
i
see
said
carpenter
what
do
you
really
do
what
we
really
do
is
to
organize
the
unskilled
for
what
do
you
organize
them
so
that
they
will
be
able
to
run
the
industries
when
the
system
of
greed
breaks
down
of
its
own
i
see
said
the
prophet
and
he
thought
for
a
moment
it
is
a
slave
revolt
exactly
said
the
other
i
know
what
they
do
to
slave
revolts
my
brother
you
are
fortunate
if
they
only
send
you
to
they
do
plenty
more
than
that
said
colver
i
will
give
you
our
pamphlet
of
blood
and
you
may
read
about
some
of
the
lynching
and
tarring
and
feathering
and
shooting
of
his
eyes
twinkled
that
a
dandy
name
you
hit
on
i
shall
be
surprised
if
it
does
carpenter
went
on
questioning
bent
upon
knowing
about
this
outlaw
organization
and
its
members
it
was
clear
before
long
that
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
young
john
colver
he
made
him
sit
beside
him
and
asked
to
hear
some
of
his
poetry
and
when
he
found
it
really
vivid
and
beautiful
he
put
his
arm
about
the
young
poet
shoulders
again
i
found
memories
of
old
childhood
phrases
stirring
in
my
mind
had
there
not
once
been
a
disciple
named
john
who
was
especially
beloved
xlii
presently
the
young
agitator
began
telling
about
an
investigation
he
had
been
making
in
the
lumber
country
of
the
northwest
he
was
writing
a
pamphlet
on
the
subject
of
a
massacre
which
had
occurred
there
a
mob
of
had
stormed
the
headquarters
of
the
wobblies
and
the
latter
had
defended
themselves
and
killed
two
or
three
of
their
assailants
a
news
agency
had
sent
out
over
the
country
a
story
to
the
effect
that
the
wobblies
had
made
an
unprovoked
assault
upon
the
that
what
the
papers
do
to
us
said
john
colver
there
have
been
scores
of
mobbings
as
a
result
and
just
now
it
may
be
worth
a
man
life
to
be
caught
carrying
a
red
card
in
any
of
these
western
so
there
was
the
subject
of
and
i
sat
and
listened
with
strangely
mingled
feelings
of
sympathy
and
repulsion
while
this
group
of
rebels
of
all
shades
and
varieties
argued
whether
it
was
really
possible
for
the
workers
to
get
free
without
some
kind
of
force
carpenter
it
appeared
was
the
only
one
in
the
company
who
believed
it
possible
the
gentle
comrade
abell
was
obliged
to
admit
that
the
socialists
in
using
political
action
were
really
resorting
to
force
in
a
veiled
form
they
sought
to
take
possession
of
the
state
by
voting
but
the
state
was
an
instrument
of
force
and
would
use
force
to
carry
out
its
will
you
are
an
anarchist
said
the
socialist
lawyer
addressing
carpenter
to
my
surprise
carpenter
was
not
shocked
by
this
if
i
admit
no
power
but
love
said
he
how
can
i
have
anything
to
do
with
government
more
visitors
called
and
were
admitted
and
presently
the
little
room
was
packed
with
people
and
a
regular
meeting
was
in
progress
i
heard
more
strange
ideas
than
i
had
ever
known
existed
in
the
world
i
tried
not
to
be
offended
but
i
thought
there
ought
to
be
at
least
a
few
words
said
for
plain
ordinary
human
beings
who
carry
no
labels
so
i
ventured
now
and
then
to
put
in
a
mild
suggestion
for
example
that
there
were
quite
a
few
people
in
the
world
who
did
not
love
all
their
neighbors
and
could
not
be
persuaded
to
love
them
all
at
once
and
it
might
be
necessary
to
put
just
a
little
restraint
upon
them
for
a
time
again
i
suggested
maybe
the
workers
were
not
yet
sufficiently
educated
to
run
the
industries
they
might
need
some
help
from
the
present
masters
just
a
little
more
education
i
ventured
and
john
colver
laughed
the
first
ugly
laugh
i
had
heard
from
him
education
by
the
masters
education
at
the
end
of
a
club
my
boy
i
argued
i
know
there
are
plenty
of
employers
who
are
rough
but
there
are
others
who
are
good
men
who
would
like
to
change
the
system
would
like
to
do
something
if
they
knew
what
it
was
but
who
will
tell
them
what
to
do
take
me
for
example
i
have
a
great
deal
of
wealth
which
i
have
not
earned
but
what
can
i
do
about
it
what
do
you
say
carpenter
i
turned
to
him
as
the
true
authority
and
the
others
also
turned
to
him
he
answered
without
hesitation
sell
everything
that
you
have
and
give
it
to
the
but
said
i
would
that
really
solve
the
problem
they
would
spend
it
and
we
should
be
right
where
we
were
said
carpenter
they
are
unemployed
because
you
have
taken
from
them
wealth
which
you
have
not
earned
give
it
back
to
and
then
seeing
that
i
was
not
satisfied
he
added
how
hard
it
is
for
a
rich
man
to
understand
the
meaning
of
social
justice
indeed
it
would
be
easier
for
a
strike
leader
to
get
the
truth
published
in
your
than
for
a
rich
man
to
understand
what
the
word
social
justice
the
company
laughed
and
i
subsided
and
let
the
wave
of
conversation
roll
by
it
was
only
later
that
i
realized
the
part
i
had
just
been
playing
it
had
been
easy
for
me
to
recognize
as
peter
but
i
had
not
known
myself
as
that
rich
young
man
who
had
asked
for
advice
and
then
rejected
it
when
he
heard
this
he
was
very
sorrowful
for
he
was
very
yes
i
had
found
my
place
in
the
story
xliii
you
may
believe
that
next
morning
my
first
thought
was
to
get
hold
of
the
times
and
see
what
they
had
done
to
my
prophet
sure
enough
there
he
was
on
the
front
page
three
columns
wide
with
the
customary
streamer
head
mob
of
anarchists
raid
prophet
and
ragged
horde
break
up
church
services
i
skimmed
over
the
story
quickly
i
noted
that
carpenter
was
represented
as
having
tried
to
knock
down
the
reverend
simpkinson
and
that
the
prophet
followers
had
assaulted
members
of
the
congregation
i
confess
to
some
relief
upon
discovering
that
my
own
humble
part
in
the
adventure
had
not
been
mentioned
i
suspected
that
my
uncle
timothy
must
have
been
busy
at
the
telephone
on
sunday
evening
but
then
i
turned
to
the
examiner
and
alas
there
i
was
a
certain
rich
young
man
rising
up
to
protect
an
incendiary
prophet
i
remembered
that
my
uncle
timothy
had
had
a
violent
row
with
the
publisher
of
the
examiner
a
year
or
two
ago
over
some
political
appointment
the
times
had
another
editorial
two
columns
double
leaded
yesterday
the
paper
had
warned
the
public
what
to
expect
today
it
saw
the
prophecies
justified
and
what
it
now
wished
to
know
was
had
western
city
a
police
department
or
had
it
not
how
much
longer
do
our
authorities
propose
to
give
rein
to
this
imposter
this
prophet
of
god
who
rides
about
town
in
a
and
consorts
with
movie
actresses
and
red
agitators
must
the
police
wait
until
his
seditious
doctrines
have
fanned
the
flames
of
mob
violence
beyond
control
must
they
wait
until
he
has
gathered
all
the
others
of
his
ilk
the
advocates
of
lunacy
and
assassination
about
him
and
caused
an
insurrection
of
class
envy
and
hate
we
call
upon
the
authorities
of
our
city
to
act
and
act
at
once
to
put
this
wretched
mountebank
behind
bars
where
he
belongs
and
keep
him
there
was
another
aspect
of
this
matter
upon
which
the
times
laid
emphasis
after
long
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
other
civic
organizations
western
city
had
been
selected
as
the
place
for
the
annual
convention
of
the
mobland
brigade
in
three
days
this
convention
would
be
called
to
order
and
already
the
delegates
were
pouring
in
by
every
train
what
impression
would
they
get
of
law
and
order
in
this
community
was
this
the
purpose
for
which
they
had
shed
their
blood
in
a
dreadful
war
that
their
country
might
be
affronted
by
the
ravings
of
an
impious
charlatan
what
had
the
mothers
of
western
city
to
say
to
this
what
did
the
local
post
of
the
mobland
brigade
propose
to
do
to
save
the
fair
name
of
their
city
said
the
times
if
our
supine
authorities
refuse
to
meet
this
emergency
we
believe
there
are
enough
americans
still
among
us
to
protect
the
cause
of
public
decency
and
to
assert
the
right
of
christian
people
to
worship
their
god
without
interference
from
the
dictatorship
of
the
lunatic
now
i
had
been
so
much
interested
in
carpenter
and
his
adventures
that
i
had
pretty
well
overlooked
this
matter
of
the
mobland
brigade
and
its
convention
i
belong
to
the
brigade
myself
and
ought
to
have
been
serving
on
the
committee
of
arrangements
instead
of
which
here
i
was
chasing
around
trying
to
save
a
prophet
who
it
appeared
really
wanted
to
get
into
trouble
yes
the
brigade
was
coming
and
i
could
foresee
what
would
happen
when
a
bunch
of
these
wild
men
encountered
carpenter
express
wagon
on
the
street
xliv
i
swallowed
a
hasty
cup
of
coffee
and
drove
in
a
taxi
to
the
labor
temple
carpenter
had
said
he
would
be
there
early
in
the
morning
to
help
with
the
relief
work
again
i
went
to
the
rooms
of
the
restaurant
workers
and
found
that
he
had
not
yet
arrived
i
noticed
a
group
of
half
a
dozen
men
standing
near
the
door
and
there
seemed
something
uncordial
in
the
look
they
gave
me
one
of
them
came
toward
me
the
same
who
had
sought
my
advice
about
permitting
carpenter
to
speak
at
the
mass
meeting
good
morning
he
said
and
then
i
thought
you
told
me
this
fellow
carpenter
was
not
a
red
well
said
i
taken
by
surprise
is
he
god
almighty
said
the
other
what
do
you
call
this
and
he
held
up
a
copy
of
the
going
in
and
shouting
in
the
middle
of
a
church
service
and
trying
to
knock
down
a
clergyman
i
could
not
help
laughing
in
the
man
face
so
even
you
labor
men
believe
what
you
read
in
the
it
happens
i
was
present
in
the
church
myself
and
i
assure
you
that
carpenter
offered
no
resistance
and
neither
did
anyone
else
in
his
group
you
remember
i
told
you
he
was
a
man
of
peace
and
that
was
all
i
told
well
said
the
other
somewhat
more
mildly
even
so
we
stand
for
this
kind
of
thing
that
no
way
to
accomplish
anything
a
whole
lot
of
our
members
are
catholics
and
what
will
they
make
of
like
this
we
trying
to
persuade
people
that
we
a
organization
and
that
our
officials
are
men
of
i
see
said
i
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
about
it
we
have
called
a
meeting
of
our
executive
committee
this
morning
and
are
going
to
adopt
a
resolution
making
clear
to
the
public
that
we
knew
nothing
about
this
church
raid
and
that
we
do
stand
for
such
things
we
would
never
have
permitted
this
man
carpenter
to
speak
on
our
platform
if
we
had
known
about
his
i
had
nothing
to
say
and
i
said
it
the
other
was
watching
me
uneasily
we
hear
the
man
proposes
to
come
back
to
our
relief
kitchen
is
that
so
i
believe
he
does
and
i
suppose
you
would
rather
he
did
is
that
it
the
other
admitted
that
was
it
and
i
laughed
he
has
had
his
thousand
dollars
worth
of
hospitality
i
well
we
do
want
to
hurt
his
feelings
said
the
other
of
gourse
our
members
are
having
a
hard
time
and
we
were
glad
to
get
the
money
but
it
would
be
better
if
our
central
organization
were
to
contribute
the
funds
rather
than
to
have
us
pay
such
a
price
as
this
newspaper
then
let
your
committee
vote
the
money
and
return
it
to
and
also
to
mary
it
took
the
man
sometime
to
figure
out
a
reply
to
this
proposition
we
have
no
objection
to
coming
here
he
said
or
miss
magna
that
is
said
i
so
long
as
they
obey
the
law
and
do
get
in
bad
with
the
western
city
after
a
moment
i
added
you
may
make
your
mind
easy
i
will
go
downstairs
and
wait
for
carpenter
and
tell
him
he
is
not
and
so
i
left
the
labor
temple
and
walked
up
and
down
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
it
was
really
rather
unreasonable
of
me
to
be
annoyed
with
this
labor
man
for
having
voiced
the
same
point
of
view
of
common
sense
which
i
had
been
defending
to
carpenter
group
on
the
previous
evening
also
i
was
obliged
to
admit
to
myself
that
if
i
were
a
labor
leader
trying
to
hold
together
a
group
of
men
in
the
face
of
public
sentiment
such
as
existed
in
this
city
i
might
not
have
the
same
carefree
laughing
attitude
towards
life
as
a
certain
rich
young
man
whose
pockets
were
stuffed
with
unearned
increments
to
this
mood
of
tolerance
i
had
brought
myself
when
i
saw
a
white
robe
come
round
the
corner
arm
in
arm
with
a
frock
coat
of
black
broadcloth
also
there
came
everett
looking
still
more
ghastly
his
nose
and
lip
having
become
purple
and
in
places
green
also
there
was
korwsky
and
two
other
men
moneta
a
young
mexican
cigarmaker
out
of
work
and
a
man
named
hamby
who
had
turned
up
on
the
previous
evening
introducing
himself
as
a
pacifist
who
had
been
arrested
and
beaten
up
during
the
war
somehow
he
did
not
conform
to
my
idea
of
a
pacifist
being
a
solid
and
rather
stoutish
fellow
with
nothing
of
the
idealist
about
him
but
carpenter
took
him
as
he
took
everybody
without
question
or
suspicion
xlv
i
joined
the
group
and
made
clear
to
them
as
tactfully
as
i
could
that
they
were
not
wanted
inside
comrade
abell
threw
up
his
hands
oh
those
labor
skates
he
cried
those
miserable
cowardly
grafting
politicians
thinking
about
nothing
but
keeping
themselves
respectable
and
holding
on
to
their
fat
comfortable
salaries
vell
vat
you
expect
cried
korwsky
you
git
de
verkin
men
into
politics
and
den
you
blame
dem
fer
bein
politicians
nothing
was
said
about
returning
the
money
i
suppose
remarked
everett
in
a
bitter
tone
something
was
said
i
replied
i
said
it
i
do
think
the
money
will
be
then
carpenter
spoke
the
money
was
given
to
feed
the
hungry
said
he
if
it
is
used
for
that
purpose
we
can
ask
no
more
and
if
men
set
out
to
preach
a
new
doctrine
how
can
they
expect
to
be
welcomed
at
once
we
have
chosen
to
be
outcasts
and
must
not
complain
let
us
go
to
the
jail
perhaps
that
is
the
place
for
so
the
little
group
set
out
in
a
new
direction
on
the
way
we
talked
about
the
labor
movement
and
what
was
the
matter
with
it
comrade
abell
said
that
carpenter
was
right
the
fundamental
trouble
was
that
the
workers
were
imbued
with
the
psychology
of
their
masters
they
would
strike
for
this
or
that
improvement
in
their
condition
and
then
go
to
the
polls
and
vote
for
the
candidates
of
their
masters
but
korwsky
was
more
vehement
he
was
an
industrial
unionist
and
thought
the
present
craft
unions
worse
than
nothing
little
groups
of
labor
aristocrats
seking
to
benefit
themselves
at
the
expense
of
the
masses
the
unorganized
unskilled
workers
and
the
floating
population
of
casual
labor
that
was
why
those
skates
at
the
labor
temple
has
so
little
enthusiasm
for
carpenter
and
his
doctrine
of
brotherhood
in
this
country
where
every
man
was
trying
to
climb
up
on
the
face
of
some
other
man
our
little
group
had
come
out
on
broadway
it
attracted
a
good
deal
of
attention
and
a
number
of
curiosity
seekers
were
beginning
to
trail
behind
us
we
get
a
crowd
again
and
carpenter
be
making
a
speech
i
thought
and
as
usual
i
faced
a
moral
conflict
should
i
stand
by
or
should
i
sneak
away
and
preserve
the
dignity
of
my
family
suddenly
came
a
sound
of
music
fifes
and
drums
it
burst
on
our
ears
from
round
the
corner
shrill
and
lively
the
girl
i
left
behind
carpenter
who
was
directly
in
front
of
me
stopped
short
and
seemed
to
shrink
away
from
what
was
coming
until
his
back
was
against
the
of
a
and
he
could
shrink
no
further
it
was
a
company
of
men
in
uniform
one
or
two
hundred
carrying
rifles
with
fixed
bayonets
which
gleamed
in
the
sunshine
there
were
two
fifers
and
two
drummers
at
their
head
and
also
two
flags
one
the
flag
of
the
brigade
and
the
other
the
flag
of
mobland
i
remembered
having
noted
in
the
morning
papers
that
the
national
commander
of
the
brigade
was
to
arrive
in
town
this
morning
and
no
doubt
this
was
a
delegation
to
do
him
honor
the
marchers
swept
down
on
us
and
past
us
and
i
watched
the
prophet
his
eyes
were
wide
his
whole
face
expressing
anguish
oh
god
my
father
he
whispered
and
seemed
to
quiver
with
each
thud
of
the
tramping
feet
on
the
pavement
after
the
storm
had
passed
he
stood
motionless
the
pain
still
in
his
face
it
is
rome
it
is
rome
he
murmured
no
said
i
it
is
he
went
on
as
if
he
had
not
heard
me
rome
eternal
rome
rome
that
never
dies
and
he
turned
upon
me
his
startled
eyes
even
the
eagles
for
a
moment
i
was
puzzled
but
then
i
remembered
the
golden
eagle
with
wings
outspread
that
perches
on
top
of
our
national
banner
we
only
use
one
eagle
i
said
somewhat
feebly
to
which
he
answered
the
soul
of
one
eagle
is
the
same
as
the
soul
of
now
i
had
felt
quite
certain
that
carpenter
would
not
get
along
very
well
with
the
brigade
and
i
was
more
than
ever
decided
that
he
must
be
got
out
of
the
way
somehow
or
other
but
meantime
the
first
task
was
to
get
him
away
from
this
crowd
which
was
rapidly
collecting
already
he
was
in
the
full
tide
of
a
speech
those
sharp
spears
can
you
not
see
them
thrust
into
the
bowels
of
human
beings
can
you
not
see
them
dripping
with
the
blood
of
your
brothers
i
whispered
to
everett
thinking
him
one
among
this
company
of
enthusiasts
who
might
have
a
little
common
sense
left
we
had
better
get
him
away
from
here
and
everett
put
his
hand
gently
on
the
prophet
shoulder
and
said
the
prisoners
in
the
jail
are
hoping
for
i
took
him
by
the
other
arm
and
we
began
to
lead
him
down
the
street
when
we
had
once
got
him
going
we
walked
him
faster
and
faster
until
presently
the
crowd
was
trailing
out
into
a
string
of
idlers
and
curiosity
seekers
as
before
xlvi
the
party
came
to
the
city
jail
and
knocked
for
admission
but
no
doubt
the
authorities
had
taken
consultation
in
the
meantime
and
there
was
no
admission
for
prophets
the
party
stood
on
the
steps
baffled
and
bewildered
a
pitiful
and
pathetic
little
group
for
my
part
i
thought
it
just
as
well
that
carpenter
had
not
got
inside
for
i
knew
what
he
would
find
there
it
happens
that
my
aunt
jennie
belongs
to
a
couple
of
women
clubs
and
they
have
been
making
a
fuss
about
our
city
jail
they
have
kept
on
making
it
for
many
years
but
apparently
without
accomplishing
anything
the
place
was
built
a
generation
ago
for
a
city
of
perhaps
our
present
size
it
is
old
and
musty
and
the
walls
are
so
badly
cracked
that
it
has
been
condemned
by
the
building
department
it
is
so
crowded
that
half
a
dozen
men
sometimes
sleep
on
the
floor
of
a
single
cell
they
are
devoured
by
vermin
and
lie
in
some
of
them
shivering
with
cold
and
others
half
suffocated
they
stay
there
sometimes
for
many
months
unheeded
because
the
courts
are
crowded
and
if
comrade
abell
word
may
be
taken
in
the
matter
every
poor
man
is
assumed
to
be
guilty
until
he
is
proven
innocent
i
have
heard
aunt
jennie
arguing
the
matter
with
considerable
energy
our
banks
are
housed
in
palaces
and
our
chamber
of
commerce
and
our
merchants
and
manufacturers
and
our
real
estate
exchange
and
all
the
rest
of
our
boosters
have
commodious
and
expensive
quarters
but
our
prisoners
lie
in
torment
and
no
one
boosts
for
them
did
carpenter
know
these
things
had
the
strikers
or
his
little
company
of
agitators
told
him
about
them
suddenly
he
said
let
us
pray
and
there
on
the
steps
of
the
jail
he
raised
his
hands
in
invocation
and
prayed
for
all
prisoners
and
captives
and
when
he
finished
comrade
abell
suddenly
lifted
his
voice
and
began
to
sing
i
would
not
have
supposed
that
so
big
a
voice
could
have
come
out
of
so
frail
a
body
but
i
was
reminded
that
abell
had
been
practicing
on
a
good
part
of
his
life
he
was
one
of
these
shouting
evangelists
only
his
gospel
was
different
he
sang
arise
ye
of
starvation
arise
ye
wretched
of
the
earth
for
justice
thunders
condemnation
a
better
world
in
birth
i
think
i
would
have
shuddered
even
more
than
i
did
if
i
had
known
the
name
of
this
song
if
i
had
realized
that
this
group
of
fanatics
were
sounding
the
dread
internationale
on
the
steps
of
our
city
jail
i
suspect
that
what
saved
them
was
the
fact
that
the
guardians
of
the
jail
had
no
more
idea
what
it
was
than
i
had
the
group
had
sung
a
couple
of
verses
when
the
doors
were
opened
and
a
policeman
stepped
out
he
addressed
carpenter
who
was
not
singing
tell
that
bunch
of
nuts
of
yours
to
can
the
to
which
carpenter
replied
i
tell
you
that
if
these
men
should
hold
their
peace
the
stones
of
your
jail
would
immediately
cry
out
and
he
turned
and
looked
up
and
down
the
streets
of
the
city
and
suddenly
i
saw
that
he
was
weeping
oh
mobland
mobland
if
you
had
known
even
at
this
time
the
way
of
justice
but
the
way
is
hid
from
your
eyes
and
you
will
not
see
it
and
now
the
hour
is
coming
the
horrors
of
the
class
war
are
upon
you
ruin
and
destruction
are
at
hand
your
towers
of
pride
shall
fall
your
own
children
shall
destroy
you
they
shall
not
leave
you
one
stone
upon
another
because
you
knew
not
the
time
for
justice
when
it
the
doors
of
the
jail
opened
again
and
three
or
four
more
policemen
came
out
with
clubs
in
their
hands
get
along
now
they
said
roughly
and
began
poking
the
prophet
and
his
disciples
in
the
back
they
poked
them
down
the
stairs
and
along
the
street
for
a
block
or
so
until
they
were
sure
the
ears
of
the
jail
inmates
would
no
longer
be
troubled
by
offensive
sounds
but
still
they
did
not
arrest
them
and
i
marveled
wondering
how
long
it
could
go
on
i
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
the
longer
the
climax
was
postponed
the
more
severe
it
would
be
there
was
quite
a
crowd
following
us
now
hoping
that
something
sensational
would
happen
and
presently
a
woman
saw
us
and
rushed
into
the
house
and
came
out
leading
a
blind
man
and
appealing
to
carpenter
to
restore
his
sight
and
when
he
stopped
to
do
this
there
were
a
couple
of
newspaper
men
and
an
operator
with
a
camera
and
more
excitement
and
more
crowds
so
we
started
to
walk
again
and
came
to
main
street
which
in
our
city
is
given
up
to
ten
cent
and
and
old
clothes
shops
and
for
workingmen
a
block
or
so
distant
we
saw
a
mass
of
people
and
something
warned
me
my
heart
sank
into
my
boots
another
mob
xlvii
there
was
shouting
and
people
running
from
every
direction
the
throng
would
surge
back
and
a
few
run
from
it
what
the
matter
i
cried
to
one
of
these
and
the
answer
was
they
cleaning
out
the
reds
comrade
abell
who
knew
the
neighborhood
exclaimed
in
dismay
it
erman
book
store
who
doing
this
i
asked
of
another
bystander
and
the
answer
was
the
brigade
they
cleaning
up
the
city
before
the
convention
and
comrade
abell
clasped
his
hands
to
his
forehead
and
wailed
in
despair
it
because
they
been
selling
the
erman
told
me
last
week
he
been
warned
to
stop
selling
it
now
i
do
know
whether
or
not
carpenter
had
ever
heard
of
this
radical
monthly
but
he
knew
that
here
was
a
mob
and
people
in
trouble
and
he
shook
off
the
hands
which
sought
to
restrain
him
and
pushed
his
way
into
the
throng
which
gave
way
before
him
either
from
respect
or
from
curiosity
i
learned
later
that
some
of
the
mob
had
dragged
the
bookseller
and
his
two
clerks
out
by
the
rear
entrance
and
were
beating
them
pretty
severely
but
fortunately
carpenter
did
not
see
this
all
he
saw
were
a
dozen
or
so
in
uniform
carrying
armfuls
of
magazines
and
books
out
into
a
little
square
which
was
made
by
the
oblique
intersection
of
two
avenues
they
were
dumping
the
stuff
into
a
pile
and
a
man
with
a
five
gallon
can
was
engaged
in
pouring
kerosene
over
it
my
friend
said
carpenter
what
is
this
that
you
do
the
other
turned
upon
him
and
stared
what
the
hell
you
got
to
do
with
it
get
out
of
the
way
there
and
to
emphasize
his
words
he
slopped
a
jet
of
kerosene
over
the
prophet
robes
said
carpenter
do
you
know
what
a
book
is
one
of
your
poets
has
described
it
as
the
precious
of
a
great
spirit
embalmed
and
preserved
to
all
the
other
laughed
scornfully
was
he
talkin
about
bolsheviki
books
you
reckon
said
carpenter
are
you
one
that
should
be
set
to
judge
books
have
you
read
these
that
you
are
about
to
destroy
and
as
the
other
paying
no
attention
knelt
down
to
strike
a
match
and
light
the
pyre
he
cried
in
a
louder
voice
behold
what
a
thing
is
war
you
have
been
trained
to
kill
your
fellow
men
the
beast
has
been
let
loose
in
your
heart
and
he
raves
within
one
of
these
pacifists
eh
cried
the
and
he
dropped
his
matches
and
sprang
up
with
fists
clenched
carpenter
faced
him
without
flinching
there
was
something
so
majestic
about
him
the
man
did
not
strike
him
he
merely
put
his
spread
hand
against
the
prophet
chest
and
shoved
him
violently
get
back
out
of
the
way
i
well
knew
the
risk
i
was
taking
but
i
could
not
refrain
now
look
here
buddy
i
began
and
the
soldier
whirled
upon
me
you
one
of
these
huns
too
i
was
all
through
the
argonne
i
said
quickly
and
i
belong
to
the
oh
ho
well
pitch
in
here
and
help
carry
out
this
bloody
arnychist
literature
i
was
about
to
answer
but
carpenter
voice
rang
out
again
he
had
turned
and
stretched
out
his
arms
to
the
crowd
and
we
both
stopped
to
listen
to
his
words
shall
ye
be
wolves
or
shall
ye
be
men
that
is
the
choice
and
ye
have
chosen
wolfhood
the
blood
of
your
brothers
is
upon
your
hands
and
murder
in
your
hearts
you
have
trained
your
young
men
to
be
killers
of
their
brothers
and
now
they
know
only
the
law
of
there
were
a
dozen
in
sound
of
this
discourse
and
i
judged
they
would
not
stand
much
of
it
suddenly
one
of
them
began
to
chant
and
the
rest
took
it
up
half
laughing
half
shouting
rough
tough
we
the
stuff
we
want
to
fight
and
we
ca
get
enough
and
after
that
hail
hail
the
gang
all
here
we
going
to
get
the
kaiser
the
crowd
joined
in
and
the
words
of
the
prophet
were
completely
drowned
out
a
moment
later
i
heard
a
gruff
voice
behind
me
make
way
here
there
came
a
policeman
shoving
through
what
all
this
about
the
fellow
with
the
kerosene
can
spoke
up
here
this
damn
arnychist
prophet
been
incitin
the
crowd
and
preachin
sedition
you
better
take
him
along
officer
and
put
him
somewhere
he
be
safe
because
me
and
my
buddies
wo
stand
no
more
bolsheviki
it
seemed
ludicrous
when
i
looked
back
upon
it
though
at
the
moment
i
did
not
appreciate
the
funny
side
here
was
a
group
of
men
engaged
in
raiding
a
beating
up
the
proprietor
and
his
clerks
and
burning
a
thousand
dollars
worth
of
books
and
magazines
on
the
public
street
but
the
policeman
did
not
see
a
bit
of
that
he
had
no
idea
that
any
such
thing
was
happening
all
he
saw
was
a
prophet
in
a
white
nightgown
dripping
with
kerosene
engaged
in
denouncing
war
he
took
him
firmly
by
the
arm
saying
come
along
now
i
guess
we
heard
enough
o
this
and
he
started
to
march
carpenter
down
the
street
take
me
too
cried
moneta
the
mexican
beside
himself
with
excitement
and
the
policeman
grabbed
him
with
the
other
hand
and
the
three
set
out
to
march
xlviii
i
no
longer
had
any
impulse
to
interfere
in
truth
i
was
glad
to
see
the
policeman
considering
that
his
worst
might
be
better
than
the
mob
best
about
half
the
crowd
followed
us
but
the
singing
died
away
and
that
gave
comrade
abell
his
chance
he
was
walking
directly
behind
the
policeman
and
suddenly
he
raised
his
voice
and
all
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
he
provided
marching
tunes
first
the
internationale
and
then
the
reg
flag
and
then
the
marseillaise
ye
sons
of
toil
awake
to
glory
hark
hark
what
myriads
bids
you
rise
your
children
wives
and
grand
sires
hoary
behold
their
tears
and
hear
their
cries
when
we
came
to
the
station
house
the
policeman
gave
moneta
a
shove
and
told
him
to
get
along
he
had
not
done
anything
and
was
denied
the
honor
of
being
arrested
the
officer
pushed
carpenter
through
the
door
and
bade
the
rest
of
us
keep
out
said
abell
i
am
an
the
hell
you
are
said
the
other
i
thought
you
were
an
opery
i
a
practicing
attorney
said
abell
and
i
represent
the
man
you
have
arrested
i
presume
i
have
a
right
to
and
i
am
a
prospective
bondsman
i
stated
with
sudden
inspiration
so
let
me
in
we
entered
and
the
policeman
led
his
prisoner
to
the
sergeant
at
the
desk
the
latter
asked
the
charge
and
was
told
disturbing
the
peace
and
blocking
now
sergeant
said
i
this
is
preposterous
all
this
prisoner
did
was
to
try
to
stop
a
mob
from
destroying
you
can
tell
all
that
to
the
magistrate
in
the
morning
said
the
sergeant
what
is
the
bail
i
demanded
you
are
prepared
to
put
up
bail
i
answered
that
i
was
and
then
for
the
first
time
carpenter
spoke
you
mean
you
wish
to
pay
money
to
secure
my
release
let
there
be
no
money
paid
for
let
me
explain
carpenter
i
pleaded
you
will
accomplish
nothing
by
spending
the
night
in
a
police
cell
you
will
have
no
opportunity
to
talk
with
the
prisoners
they
will
keep
you
by
he
answered
my
father
will
be
with
and
gazing
into
the
face
of
the
sergeant
he
demanded
do
you
think
you
can
build
a
cell
to
which
my
father
can
not
come
the
officer
was
an
old
hand
with
a
fringe
of
grey
hair
around
his
bald
head
and
no
doubt
he
had
been
asked
many
queer
questions
in
his
day
his
response
was
to
inquire
the
prisoner
name
and
when
the
prisoner
kept
haughty
silence
he
wrote
down
john
doe
carpenter
and
proceeded
where
do
you
live
said
carpenter
the
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
of
the
air
have
nests
but
he
that
espouses
the
cause
of
justice
has
no
home
in
a
world
of
so
the
sergeant
wrote
no
address
and
nodded
to
a
jailer
who
took
the
prophet
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
through
a
door
abell
and
i
went
outside
and
joined
the
rest
of
the
group
none
of
us
knew
just
what
to
do
with
the
exception
of
everett
who
sat
on
the
steps
with
his
notebook
and
made
me
repeat
to
him
word
for
word
what
carpenter
had
said
xlix
comrade
abell
told
us
where
the
was
located
and
we
agreed
to
be
there
at
nine
next
morning
then
i
parted
from
the
rest
and
walked
until
i
met
a
taxi
and
drove
to
my
rooms
i
felt
desolate
and
forlorn
nothing
in
my
old
life
had
any
interest
for
me
this
was
the
afternoon
when
i
usually
went
to
the
athletic
club
to
box
but
now
i
found
myself
wondering
what
would
carpenter
say
to
such
imitation
fighting
i
decided
i
would
stay
by
myself
for
a
while
and
take
a
walk
and
think
things
over
i
had
been
dissatisfied
with
my
life
for
a
long
time
the
glamor
had
begun
to
wear
off
the
excitement
of
youth
and
i
had
begun
to
suspect
that
my
life
was
idle
and
vain
now
i
knew
that
it
was
and
also
i
knew
that
the
world
was
a
place
of
torment
and
woe
i
returned
late
in
the
afternoon
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
my
telephone
rang
and
i
discovered
that
somebody
else
was
dissatisfied
with
life
hello

then
i

of

friends
and
that
young
everett
he
got
pretty
badly
hurt
and
he
sticking

i
started
what
do
you
say

his
name
matthew
said
vy
you
ask
nothing
said
i
just
a
coincidence
our
conversation
ended
with
the
remark
by
that
he
would
call
up
the
and
arrange
to
see
carpenter
five
minutes
later
the
telephone
rang
again
and
i
heard
the
magnate
voice
billy
dey
say
he
been
bailed
out
what
i
cried
he
declared
he
would
have
it
somebody
done
it
vitout
askin
him
de
money
vas
paid
and
dey
turned
him
out
who
did
it
guess
you
mean
it
was
you
i
vould
dared
i
only
shoost
found
out
about
it
mary
magna
done
it
and
she
took
him
avay
good
lord
i
exclaimed
and
before
my
mind
eye
flashed
another
headline
fair
film
star
frees
prophet
i
promised
to
try
to
find
out
about
the
prophet
at
once
he
get
away
i
said
because
he
does
ride
in
automobiles
and
he
and
mary
ca
walk
very
far
on
the
street
without
the
newspapers
finding
them
i
took
my
and
looked
up
the
name
abell
it
is
an
unusual
name
and
there
was
only
one
attorney
bearing
it
i
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
first
name
of
this
attorney
was
mark
i
called
him
on
the
phone
and
heard
the
familiar
gentle
voice
yes
comrade
carpenter
had
just
arrived
and
miss
magna
was
with
him
they
were
going
to
have
a
little
party
and
they
would
be
glad
to
have
me
come
yes
would
be
welcome
of
course
so
then
i
called
up
the
magnate
of
the
pictures
and
not
without
an
inward
smile
conferred
on
him
the
gracious
permission
to
spend
the
evening
at
the
headquarters
of
local
western
city
of
the
socialist
party
l
when
i
got
to
the
i
found
that
a
feast
had
been
spread
i
do
know
where
the
money
came
from
maybe
it
was
bolshevik
gold
as
the
enemy
charged
or
maybe
it
was
the
gains
of
a
million
dollar
movie
anyhow
there
was
a
table
spread
with
a
couple
of
cloths
that
were
clean
if
ragged
and
on
them
flowers
and
fruit
carpenter
was
seated
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
i
noted
to
my
surprise
that
he
had
on
a
beautiful
robe
of
linen
instead
of
the
one
he
had
formerly
worn
which
was
not
only
stained
with
kerosene
but
filthy
with
the
dust
of
the
streets
i
learned
that
had
brought
this
festal
garment
a
simple
matter
for
her
because
in
movie
studios
they
have
wardrobe
rooms
where
they
turn
out
any
sort
of
costume
imaginable
this
robe
was
so
striking
that
it
created
a
little
controversy
james
the
carpenter
who
had
an
ascetic
spirit
considered
it
necessary
to
speak
plainly
and
point
out
that
would
have
done
better
to
take
the
money
and
give
it
to
the
poor
but
the
prophet
answered
let
this
woman
alone
she
has
done
a
good
thing
the
poor
you
have
always
with
you
but
me
you
have
only
for
a
short
time
this
woman
has
helped
to
make
our
feast
happy
and
men
will
tell
about
it
in
future
but
that
did
not
satisfy
the
ascetic
james
who
retired
to
his
corner
grumbling
i
know
we
going
to
start
a
new
church
the
same
old
graft
all
over
again
a
man
has
no
business
to
say
a
thing
like
that
the
first
thing
you
know
they
be
taking
the
mite
to
buy
silk
and
velvet
dresses
for
him
and
golden
goblets
for
him
to
drink
from
and
then
before
you
know
it
they
be
setting
him
up
in
stained
glass
windows
and
priests
be
wearing
jewelled
robes
and
saying
it
all
right
and
quoting
his
words
i
perceived
that
it
was
so
easy
for
a
prophet
to
manage
a
bunch
of
disciples
in
these
modern
days
the
controversy
did
not
seem
to
trouble
who
was
waddling
about
perfectly
happy
in
the
kitchen
doing
the
things
she
would
have
done
all
the
time
if
her
husband
social
position
had
not
required
her
to
keep
a
dozen
servants
also
i
noted
to
my
great
astonishment
that
mary
magna
instead
of
taking
a
place
at
the
prophet
right
hand
according
to
the
prerogative
of
queens
had
put
on
a
plain
apron
and
was
helping
maw
and
abell
more
surprising
yet
had
seated
himself
inconspicuously
at
the
foot
of
the
table
while
at
the
prophet
right
hand
there
sat
a
convict
with
a
twenty
year
jail
sentence
hanging
over
him
john
colver
the
wobbly
poet
again
an
ancient
phrase
learned
in
childhood
came
floating
through
my
mind
he
hath
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seats
and
exalted
them
of
low
degree
somehow
word
had
been
got
to
all
the
little
group
of
agitators
of
various
shades
there
was
korwsky
the
secretary
of
the
union
whose
first
name
i
learned
was
luka
also
his
fellow
russian
the
simon
karlin
and
tom
moneta
the
young
mexican
there
was
matthew
everett
free
to
be
a
guest
on
this
occasion
because
had
brought
along
another
stenographer
there
was
mark
abell
and
another
socialist
a
young
irishman
named
andy
lynch
a
veteran
of
the
late
war
who
had
come
home
completely
cured
of
militarism
and
was
now
spending
his
time
distributing
socialist
leaflets
and
preaching
to
the
workers
wherever
he
could
get
two
or
three
to
listen
also
there
was
hamby
the
pacifist
whom
i
did
not
like
and
a
second
brought
by
colver
a
lad
named
philip
who
had
recently
been
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
and
was
at
this
moment
a
fugitive
from
justice
with
a
price
upon
his
head
the
door
of
the
room
was
opened
and
another
man
came
in
a
striking
figure
tall
and
gaunt
with
old
and
pitifully
untidy
clothing
and
a
half
month
growth
of
beard
upon
his
chin
he
wore
an
old
black
hat
frayed
at
the
edges
but
under
this
hat
was
a
face
of
such
gentleness
and
sadness
that
it
made
you
think
of
carpenter
own
withal
it
was
a
yankee
face
of
that
lean
stringy
kind
that
we
know
so
well
the
newcomer
eyes
fell
upon
carpenter
and
his
face
lighted
he
set
down
an
old
that
he
was
carrying
and
stretched
out
his
two
hands
and
went
to
him
carpenter
i
been
looking
for
you
and
carpenter
answered
my
brother
and
the
two
clasped
hands
and
i
thought
to
myself
with
astonishment
how
does
carpenter
know
this
man
presently
i
whispered
to
abell
who
is
he
i
learned
that
he
was
one
i
had
heard
of
in
the
papers
bartholomew
howard
the
millionaire
hobo
he
was
grandson
and
heir
of
one
of
our
great
captains
of
industry
and
had
taken
literally
the
advice
of
the
prophet
to
sell
all
that
he
had
and
give
it
to
the
unemployed
he
traveled
over
the
country
living
among
the
hobos
and
organizing
them
into
his
brotherhood
now
you
would
have
thought
that
he
and
carpenter
had
known
each
other
all
their
lives
as
i
watched
them
i
found
myself
thinking
where
are
the
clergy
and
the
pillars
of
bartholomew
church
there
were
none
of
them
at
this
li
had
stopped
at
a
caterer
on
his
way
to
the
gathering
and
had
done
his
humble
best
in
the
form
of
a
strawberry
almost
half
as
large
around
as
himself
also
several
bottles
of
purple
color
with
the
label
of
grape
juice
when
the
company
gathered
at
the
table
and
these
bottles
were
opened
they
made
a
suspicious
noise
and
so
we
all
made
jokes
as
people
have
the
habit
of
doing
in
these
days
of
getting
used
to
prohibition
i
noticed
that
carpenter
laughed
at
the
jokes
and
seemed
to
enjoy
the
whole
festivity
it
happened
that
fate
had
placed
me
next
to
james
so
i
listened
to
more
asceticism
he
ought
to
do
things
like
this
people
will
say
he
likes
to
eat
rich
food
and
to
drink
it
bad
for
the
movement
for
such
things
to
be
cheer
up
my
friend
i
laughed
even
the
bolsheviks
have
a
feast
now
and
then
when
they
can
get
you
see
what
the
newspapers
do
with
this
tomorrow
growled
the
other
then
you
wo
think
it
so
forget
it
i
said
there
are
any
reporters
no
said
he
but
there
are
spies
here
you
may
be
sure
there
are
spies
everywhere
nowadays
you
see
presently
carpenter
called
on
some
of
the
company
for
speeches
would
bartholomew
tell
about
the
unemployed
what
their
organization
was
doing
and
what
were
their
plans
and
after
that
he
asked
john
colver
who
sat
on
his
right
hand
to
recite
some
of
his
verses
john
and
his
friend
philip
a
blue
eyed
lad
who
looked
as
if
he
might
be
in
high
school
told
stories
about
the
adventures
of
outlaw
agitators
for
several
months
these
two
had
been
traveling
the
country
as
blanket
stiffs
securing
employment
in
and
mines
gathering
the
workers
secretly
in
the
woods
to
listen
to
the
new
gospel
of
deliverance
the
employers
were
organized
on
a
scale
everywhere
throughout
the
country
and
the
workers
with
their
feeble
craft
unions
were
like
men
using
bows
and
arrows
against
there
must
be
one
big
union
that
was
the
slogan
and
if
you
preached
it
you
went
every
hour
in
peril
of
such
a
fate
that
you
counted
fourteen
years
in
jail
as
comparatively
a
happy
ending
said
carpenter
it
is
not
such
a
bad
thing
for
a
cause
to
have
its
preachers
go
to
well
said
the
lad
of
the
blue
eyes
and
the
freckled
face
we
try
to
keep
a
few
outside
to
tell
what
the
rest
are
in
for
later
on
i
remember
john
colver
told
a
funny
story
about
this
pal
of
his
the
story
had
to
do
with
grape
juice
instead
of
with
propaganda
but
it
appealed
to
me
because
it
showed
the
gay
spirit
of
these
lads
the
two
of
them
had
sought
refuge
from
a
storm
in
a
barn
and
there
lying
buried
in
the
hay
with
the
rain
pouring
down
on
the
roof
they
had
heard
the
farmer
coming
to
milk
his
cows
the
man
had
evidently
just
parted
from
his
wife
and
there
had
been
a
quarrel
but
the
farmer
had
dared
to
say
what
he
wanted
to
so
now
he
took
it
out
on
the
cows
na
na
na
he
shouted
with
furious
vehemence
that
it
go
on
nag
nag
nag
do
stop
or
i
might
manage
to
get
a
word
in
yes
i
late
of
course
i
late
do
you
expect
me
to
drive
by
the
clock
maybe
i
did
forget
the
sugar
maybe
i
got
nothing
on
my
mind
but
errands
whiskey
maybe
it
whiskey
and
maybe
it
gin
and
maybe
it
the
farmer
set
down
his
and
his
lantern
and
shook
his
clenched
fist
at
the
patient
cattle
i
a
man
i
am
and
i
have
you
understand
i
master
in
my
own
house
i
drink
if
i
feel
like
drinking
i
stop
and
chat
with
my
neighbors
if
i
feel
like
stopping
i
buy
sugar
if
i
remember
to
buy
it
and
if
you
like
it
you
can
buy
your
own
and
so
on
becoming
more
inspired
with
his
own
eloquence
or
maybe
with
the
whiskey
or
the
gin
or
the
until
young
philip
became
so
filled
with
the
spirit
of
the
combat
that
he
popped
up
out
of
the
hay
and
shouted
good
for
you
old
man
stand
up
for
your
rights
do
let
her
down
you
hurrah
for
men
and
the
astounded
farmer
stood
staring
with
his
mouth
open
while
the
two
wobbles
leaped
up
and
fled
from
the
barn
so
convulsed
with
laughter
they
hardly
noticed
the
floods
of
rain
pouring
down
upon
them
lii
but
of
course
it
was
long
before
this
little
company
became
serious
again
carpenter
told
franklin
that
he
ought
not
stay
here
he
carpenter
was
too
conspicuous
a
figure
the
authorities
were
certain
to
be
watching
him
korwsky
backed
him
up
there
were
sure
to
be
spies
here
they
would
never
leave
such
a
man
unwatched
they
would
set
to
work
to
get
something
on
him
and
if
they
could
get
it
they
would
make
it
when
carpenter
asked
what
he
meant
he
explained
dey
plant
dynamite
in
de
place
vere
you
are
or
dey
fake
up
some
letters
to
show
you
been
plannin
and
do
people
believe
such
things
asked
carpenter
believe
dem
cried
korwsky
if
dey
see
it
in
de
papers
dey
believe
it
sure
dey
do
the
prophet
answered
let
a
man
live
so
that
the
world
will
believe
him
and
not
his
then
he
added
a
startling
remark
there
is
one
among
us
who
will
betray
of
course
they
all
looked
at
one
another
in
consternation
they
were
deeply
distressed
and
each
tried
in
turn
comrade
or
brother
or
or
whatever
term
they
used
is
it
i
presently
the
sturdy
looking
fellow
named
hamby
who
called
himself
a
pacifist
asked
is
it
i
and
carpenter
answered
quietly
you
have
said
then
of
course
some
of
the
others
started
up
they
wanted
to
throw
him
out
but
carpenter
bade
them
sit
down
again
saying
let
things
take
their
course
for
the
powers
of
this
world
will
perish
more
quickly
if
they
are
permitted
to
kill
apparently
he
saw
no
reason
why
this
episode
should
be
permitted
to
interfere
with
the
festivities
mary
magna
came
in
laughing
bearing
the
strawberry
and
set
it
on
the
table
and
proceeded
to
portion
it
out
when
it
was
served
carpenter
said
i
shall
not
be
with
you
much
longer
my
friends
but
you
will
remember
me
when
you
see
this
beautiful
red
fruit
on
top
of
a
cake
and
also
you
will
think
of
me
and
my
message
when
you
taste
rich
purple
that
has
perhaps
stayed
a
day
or
two
too
long
in
the
bottle
some
of
the
company
laughed
but
others
of
them
had
tears
in
their
eyes
and
i
noticed
that
in
the
midst
of
the
merriment
the
fellow
hamby
got
up
and
slipped
out
of
the
room
not
long
after
that
the
company
began
to
disperse
for
various
reasons
karlin
explained
that
his
old
horse
had
been
working
all
day
and
had
had
no
supper
colver
was
uneasy
not
for
himself
but
for
his
friend
and
i
saw
him
start
every
time
the
door
was
opened
also
was
having
some
taken
and
he
and
mary
were
to
see
the
work
finally
carpenter
dismissed
the
company
with
the
statement
that
he
wished
to
retire
to
comrade
abell
private
office
to
pray
and
abell
and
his
friend
lynch
and
the
young
mexican
said
they
would
watch
and
wait
for
him
the
rest
of
us
took
our
departure
not
without
misgivings
and
sorrow
in
our
hearts
liii
now
you
may
find
it
hard
to
believe
a
confession
which
i
have
put
off
making
the
fact
that
at
this
time
i
was
engaged
to
be
married
there
was
a
certain
member
of
what
is
called
the
younger
set
whom
i
had
given
reason
to
expect
that
i
would
think
about
her
at
least
once
in
a
while
but
here
for
precisely
three
days
i
had
been
chasing
about
at
the
skirts
of
a
prophet
fresh
from
god
getting
my
name
into
the
newspapers
in
scandalous
fashion
and
not
daring
even
to
call
the
young
lady
on
the
telephone
and
make
apologies
that
evening
there
was
a
at
her
home
and
i
supposed
i
was
supposed
to
be
there
but
no
one
had
bothered
to
invite
me
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
would
not
have
known
of
the
affair
if
i
had
not
seen
the
announcement
in
the
papers
i
was
too
late
for
the
dinner
but
i
got
myself
a
taxicab
and
drove
to
my
room
and
changed
my
clothes
and
hurried
in
my
own
car
to
the
dance
you
would
not
be
interested
in
the
fact
that
when
i
arrived
i
was
treated
as
an
unwelcome
guest
and
miss
betty
even
went
so
far
as
to
remind
me
that
i
had
not
been
invited
but
after
i
had
pleaded
she
consented
to
dance
with
me
and
so
for
an
hour
or
two
i
tried
to
forget
there
were
any
people
in
the
world
who
had
anything
to
do
but
be
happy
just
as
i
was
succeeding
the
butler
came
calling
me
to
the
telephone
and
i
answered
and
who
should
it
be
but
old
joe
my
surprise
became
consternation
at
his
first
words
billy
your
friend
carpenter
is
in
peril
what
do
you
mean
they
are
going
to
get
him
good
god
how
do
you
know
it
a
long
story
and
no
time
to
tell
it
somebody
tipped
me
off
where
can
i
meet
you
every
minute
is
where
are
you
i
asked
and
learned
that
he
was
at
his
home
not
far
away
i
said
i
would
come
there
and
i
hurried
to
betty
and
had
another
scene
with
her
and
left
her
weeping
vowing
that
she
would
never
see
me
again
i
ran
out
and
jumped
into
my
car
and
i
would
hate
to
tell
what
i
did
to
the
speed
laws
of
western
city
suffice
it
to
say
that
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
in
old
joe
den
and
he
was
telling
me
his
story
part
of
it
i
got
then
and
part
of
it
later
but
i
might
as
well
tell
it
all
at
once
and
be
done
with
it
it
happened
that
at
the
restaurant
where
old
joe
and
i
had
dined
before
we
went
to
the
he
had
met
a
girl
whom
he
knew
too
well
after
the
fashion
of
young
men
about
town
in
greeting
her
on
the
way
out
he
had
told
her
he
was
going
to
hear
the
new
prophet
and
had
laughingly
suggested
that
the
meeting
was
free
the
girl
out
of
idle
curiosity
had
come
and
had
been
touched
by
carpenter
physical
if
not
by
his
moral
charms
it
chanced
that
this
girl
was
living
with
a
man
who
stood
high
in
the
secret
service
department
of
big
business
in
our
city
so
she
had
got
the
full
story
of
what
was
being
planned
against
carpenter
that
afternoon
it
appeared
there
had
been
a
meeting
between
algernon
de
wiggs
president
of
our
chamber
of
commerce
and
westerly
secretary
of
our
m
and
and
gerald
carson
organizer
of
our
boosters
these
three
had
put
up
six
thousand
dollars
and
turned
it
over
to
their
secret
service
agents
with
instructions
that
carpenter
agitations
in
western
city
were
to
be
ended
inside
of
hours
a
plan
had
been
worked
out
every
detail
of
which
had
been
phoned
to
old
joe
a
group
of
men
members
of
the
brigade
had
been
hired
to
seize
the
prophet
and
treat
him
to
a
tar
and
feathering
it
had
not
taken
much
to
move
them
to
action
for
the
afternoon
papers
were
full
of
accounts
of
carpenter
speech
on
main
street
his
denunciation
of
war
and
of
soldiers
as
murderers
and
but
that
was
not
all
said
old
joe
and
i
saw
that
his
hand
was
trembling
as
he
spoke
it
appeared
that
there
was
an
operative
named
hamby
who
was
one
of
carpenter
followers
by
god
i
burst
out
in
sudden
fury
i
was
sure
that
fellow
was
a
crook
yes
said
the
other
he
been
telephoning
in
regular
reports
as
to
carpenter
doings
and
now
it
been
arranged
that
he
is
to
put
an
infernal
machine
in
the
socialist
headquarters
where
carpenter
has
been
staying
i
was
almost
speechless
you
mean
to
blow
them
up
no
to
blow
up
their
reputations
hamby
is
to
lure
carpenter
out
to
the
street
and
when
the
gang
grabs
him
hamby
will
fire
a
shot
and
there
will
be
three
or
four
secret
agents
in
the
crowd
who
will
incite
the
others
and
see
to
it
that
carpenter
is
lynched
instead
of
being
tarred
and
feathered
liv
so
there
was
the
layout
and
now
what
was
to
be
done
the
first
thing
was
to
call
abell
on
the
phone
and
see
if
anything
had
happened
i
picked
up
the
receiver
but
alas
the
report
was
no
i
urged
central
to
try
several
times
but
all
i
could
get
was
i
am
ringing
carpenter
no
doubt
was
praying
what
were
the
others
doing
i
kept
on
trying
but
finally
gave
up
could
the
mob
have
taken
them
away
but
old
joe
answered
no
a
definite
hour
had
been
set
the
men
were
to
gather
on
the
stroke
of
midnight
we
had
nearly
an
hour
yet
my
first
thought
was
that
we
should
hurry
to
the
socialist
headquarters
and
get
carpenter
out
of
the
way
but
my
friend
pointed
out
that
the
place
was
certain
to
be
watched
and
we
might
find
ourselves
held
up
by
the
armed
detectives
they
would
hardly
take
a
chance
of
letting
their
prey
escape
at
this
hour
also
i
realized
there
was
no
use
figuring
on
any
plan
that
involved
spiriting
carpenter
away
quietly
by
the
roof
or
a
rear
entrance
or
anything
of
that
sort
he
would
insist
on
staying
and
facing
his
enemies
i
put
my
wits
to
work
we
needed
a
crowd
we
needed
in
fact
a
mob
of
our
own
and
suddenly
the
word
brought
to
me
an
inspiration
that
mob
which
had
drilled
at
eternal
city
i
recalled
that
a
year
or
so
ago
i
had
been
lured
to
sit
through
a
very
dull
feature
picture
which
the
magnate
had
made
showing
the
salvation
of
our
country
by
the
ku
klux
klan
and
i
knew
enough
about
studio
methods
to
be
sure
they
had
not
thrown
away
the
costumes
but
would
have
them
stored
here
was
the
way
to
save
our
prophet
here
was
the
way
to
get
what
one
wanted
in
mobland
i
picked
up
the
receiver
and
called
eternal
city
yes
was
there
but
he
was
on
the
lot
and
could
not
be
disturbed
i
gave
my
name
and
stated
that
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
must
come
to
the
phone
instantly
a
couple
of
minutes
later
i
heard
his
voice
and
told
him
the
situation
and
also
my
scheme
he
must
come
himself
to
make
sure
that
his
orders
were
obeyed
he
must
bring
several
of
men
clad
in
the
full
regalia
of
mobland
great
secret
society
and
they
must
arrive
at
place
precisely
on
the
stroke
of
midnight
the
men
must
be
paid
five
dollars
apiece
and
be
told
that
if
they
succeeded
in
bringing
away
the
prophet
unharmed
they
would
each
get
ten
dollars
extra
i
will
put
up
that
money
i
said
to
but
to
my
surprise
he
cried
you
ai
gon
na
put
up
nuttin
god
damn
dem
fellers
i
beat
if
it
costs
me
a
million
so
i
realized
that
the
prophet
had
made
one
more
convert
have
you
got
that
bus
with
the
siren
i
asked
and
when
he
answered
yes
i
said
let
that
be
the
signal
when
we
hear
it
joe
and
i
will
bring
carpenter
down
to
the
street
and
if
the
brigade
is
there
it
up
to
you
to
persuade
them
you
the
bigger
mob
then
old
joe
and
i
ran
down
to
my
car
and
drove
at
full
speed
to
the
socialist
headquarters
and
on
the
way
we
worked
out
our
own
plan
of
campaign
the
real
was
hamby
the
secret
agent
and
we
must
manage
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
despite
his
pose
of
pacifism
he
was
certain
to
be
armed
said
old
joe
yet
we
must
take
a
chance
and
do
the
job
unarmed
if
we
should
get
into
a
they
would
certainly
put
it
onto
us
and
they
would
make
it
a
hanging
matter
too
i
named
over
the
members
of
carpenter
party
who
had
stayed
with
him
andy
lynch
the
was
probably
a
useful
man
and
we
would
get
his
help
we
would
get
rid
of
hamby
and
then
we
would
wait
for
and
his
siren
by
the
time
these
plans
were
thoroughly
talked
out
we
had
reached
the
building
in
which
the
headquarters
were
located
there
were
lights
in
the
main
room
upstairs
and
the
door
which
led
up
to
them
was
open
the
street
was
apparently
deserted
and
we
did
not
stop
to
look
for
any
operatives
but
left
our
machine
and
stole
quietly
upstairs
and
into
the
room
lv
comrade
abell
sat
at
the
table
with
his
head
bowed
in
his
arms
sound
asleep
lynch
the
and
tom
moneta
the
mexican
were
lying
on
the
floor
snoring
and
on
a
chair
near
the
doorway
watching
the
scene
sat
hamby
wide
awake
we
knew
he
was
awake
because
he
leaped
to
his
feet
the
instant
we
entered
the
door
oh
it
you
he
said
recognizing
me
i
noted
the
alarm
in
his
voice
i
beckoned
to
him
softly
come
here
a
moment
and
he
came
out
into
the
at
the
same
time
old
joe
stepped
across
the
big
room
and
stooped
down
and
waked
up
lynch
we
had
agreed
that
joe
was
to
give
lynch
a
whispered
explanation
of
the
situation
while
i
kept
hamby
busy
where
is
carpenter
i
asked
he
in
the
private
office
well
said
i
there
a
sick
woman
who
needs
help
very
badly
i
wonder
if
we
better
disturb
i
do
know
said
hamby
i
been
here
an
hour
and
heard
a
sound
maybe
he
i
was
uncertain
what
i
should
do
and
i
elaborately
explained
my
uncertainty
of
course
praying
was
an
important
and
useful
occupation
and
i
knew
that
the
prophet
laid
great
stress
upon
it
and
all
of
us
who
loved
him
so
dearly
must
respect
his
wishes
yes
of
course
said
hamby
yet
at
the
same
time
i
continued
this
woman
was
very
ill
a
case
of
ptomaine
poisoning
do
you
think
he
can
cure
that
asked
hamby
guilelessly
and
at
that
moment
old
joe
and
lynch
came
from
the
big
room
hamby
started
to
turn
but
he
was
too
late
old
joe
arms
went
around
him
and
hamby
two
elbows
were
clamped
to
his
sides
in
a
grip
which
more
than
one
professional
wrestler
in
our
part
of
the
world
has
found
it
impossible
to
break
at
the
same
time
i
stooped
on
my
knees
and
grasped
the
man
two
wrists
because
we
were
taking
no
chances
of
his
gun
lynch
the
had
a
cloth
taken
from
the
big
table
and
he
flung
this
over
the
head
of
the
pacifist
and
stifled
his
cries
i
took
a
revolver
from
his
but
joe
was
not
satisfied
search
him
carefully
said
he
and
so
i
discovered
another
weapon
in
a
then
i
made
hasty
search
in
a
big
closet
of
the
room
and
found
a
lot
of
bundles
of
books
and
magazines
tied
with
stout
cords
i
took
the
cords
and
we
bound
the
pacifist
wrists
and
ankles
and
put
a
gag
in
his
mouth
and
then
we
felt
sure
he
was
really
a
pacifist
we
carried
him
to
the
closet
and
laid
him
on
the
floor
where
a
humorous
idea
came
to
us
these
bundles
of
magazines
and
books
were
no
doubt
the
ones
which
the
mob
had
confiscated
from
comrade
abell
since
they
were
no
longer
saleable
they
might
as
well
be
put
to
some
use
so
i
gathered
armfuls
of
them
and
distributed
them
over
the
form
of
hamby
until
there
was
no
longer
a
trace
of
him
visible
and
while
i
was
doing
this
i
noticed
in
one
corner
of
the
closet
under
the
bundles
a
wooden
box
about
a
foot
square
upon
trying
to
lift
it
i
discovered
that
it
weighed
several
times
as
much
as
it
should
have
weighed
if
it
had
contained
printed
matter
here
our
infernal
machine
i
whispered
and
i
picked
it
up
gingerly
and
tiptoed
out
of
the
room
and
back
to
the
kitchen
and
down
a
rear
stairway
of
the
building
i
unlocked
the
door
and
opened
it
and
there
crouching
in
the
shadows
alongside
the
door
just
as
i
expected
i
saw
a
man
hello
i
whispered
hello
said
he
badly
startled
here
something
belonging
to
hamby
he
wants
me
to
give
it
to
you
be
careful
it
i
deposited
the
box
in
his
hands
and
shut
the
door
and
turned
the
lock
again
and
groped
my
way
upstairs
chuckling
to
myself
as
i
imagined
the
man
plight
he
would
not
know
what
to
make
of
this
incident
and
i
had
an
idea
he
would
not
be
able
to
find
out
because
he
could
not
leave
his
post
nor
would
he
have
much
time
to
figure
over
the
matter
for
when
i
got
back
to
the
light
i
looked
at
my
watch
and
it
lacked
just
three
minutes
to
twelve
i
found
that
lynch
and
old
joe
had
shut
the
pacifist
in
the
closet
and
were
in
the
waiting
for
me
i
whispered
that
everything
was
all
right
a
moment
later
we
heard
a
sound
in
the
big
room
and
peered
in
and
saw
a
door
at
the
far
end
open
and
there
was
carpenter
standing
with
his
white
robes
gleaming
in
the
light
after
a
moment
i
realized
that
they
gleamed
even
more
than
was
natural
i
perceived
once
more
that
strange
aura
which
had
been
noticed
at
the
and
by
means
of
it
i
noticed
an
even
more
startling
thing
there
were
drops
of
sweat
on
forehead
as
always
when
he
had
labored
intensely
in
his
soul
this
time
i
saw
that
the
drops
were
large
and
they
were
drops
of
blood
a
trembling
seized
me
i
was
before
this
man
afraid
to
go
on
with
what
i
was
doing
and
equally
afraid
to
back
out
i
remained
staring
helplessly
and
saw
him
approach
the
sleeping
figures
and
stand
looking
at
them
could
you
not
watch
with
me
one
hour
he
said
in
his
gentle
sad
voice
and
he
put
his
hand
on
comrade
abell
shoulder
with
the
words
the
time
has
abell
started
to
his
feet
and
began
to
apologize
the
other
said
nothing
but
stooped
and
waked
moneta
and
at
that
moment
i
heard
the
shrill
blast
of
a
whistle
outside
on
the
street
there
the
brigade
whispered
old
joe
lvi
i
ran
down
the
stairs
and
peered
through
the
doorway
and
sure
enough
there
were
four
or
five
automobiles
stopped
before
the
headquarters
having
approached
from
opposite
direction
i
stood
just
long
enough
to
see
a
crowd
of
men
in
khaki
uniforms
jumping
out
then
i
ran
back
and
leaving
old
joe
and
lynch
to
keep
guard
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
walked
in
and
greeted
carpenter
he
expressed
no
surprise
at
seeing
me
evidently
his
thoughts
were
on
other
things
for
my
part
i
was
trembling
with
excitement
so
that
my
knees
would
barely
hold
me
how
long
would
it
be
before
and
his
crowd
appeared
i
could
figure
the
time
it
should
take
them
to
drive
from
eternal
city
but
suppose
something
held
them
up
how
long
would
the
men
stay
out
on
the
street
waiting
for
hamby
to
answer
their
signal
surely
not
many
minutes
they
would
storm
the
place
and
hunt
out
their
victim
for
themselves
and
suppose
they
should
carry
him
off
before
the
others
arrived
i
had
hamby
two
revolvers
in
my
pocket
should
we
use
them
or
not
the
thought
hit
me
all
of
a
sudden
and
apparently
it
hit
old
joe
at
the
same
moment
give
me
those
guns
billy
he
whispered
and
i
put
them
obediently
into
his
hands
and
he
went
quickly
into
the
rear
rooms
at
the
end
of
a
minute
he
returned
saying
i
unloaded
them
and
threw
them
out
of
the
back
and
even
as
he
spoke
the
silence
of
the
night
outside
was
shattered
by
the
scream
of
that
siren
which
served
to
warn
people
out
of
the
way
when
was
moving
his
companies
about
on
i
went
up
to
carpenter
i
did
enjoy
telling
him
a
lie
in
fact
i
had
an
idea
that
one
could
lie
to
him
successfully
but
i
tried
it
mr
carpenter
hamby
left
a
message
he
had
to
go
downstairs
and
said
he
wanted
to
see
you
would
you
come
down
and
meet
him
ah
yes
said
carpenter
and
he
walked
to
the
door
and
down
the
stairs
without
another
word
the
rest
of
us
followed
him
abell
and
moneta
first
they
being
innocent
and
unsuspicious
and
then
lynch
and
then
joe
and
i
the
prophet
stepped
out
to
the
street
and
was
instantly
surrounded
by
a
group
of
a
dozen
men
two
of
whom
grasped
him
by
the
arms
he
did
not
lift
a
hand
nor
even
make
a
sound
comrade
abell
of
course
started
to
cry
out
in
protest
moneta
the
mexican
reverted
to
his
ancestors
his
hand
flashed
to
an
inside
pocket
and
a
knife
leaped
out
a
soldier
had
hold
of
him
and
moneta
shouted
stand
back
or
i
cut
off
your
at
which
carpenter
turned
and
in
a
stern
commanding
voice
proclaimed
let
no
man
use
force
in
my
behalf
they
who
use
force
shall
perish
by
moneta
stood
still
and
of
course
lynch
and
old
joe
and
i
stood
still
and
the
dozen
men
about
carpenter
started
to
lead
him
away
to
their
automobiles
but
they
did
not
get
very
far
upon
the
silence
of
the
street
a
voice
rang
out
ordinarily
one
would
have
known
it
was
the
voice
of
a
woman
but
in
this
place
under
these
exciting
circumstances
it
seemed
the
voice
of
a
supernatural
being
it
almost
sang
the
words
it
was
like
a
silver
bugle
calling
across
a
glorious
thrilling
hypnotic
make
for
the
grand
imperial
of
the
klux
klan
every
one
was
startled
but
i
think
i
was
startled
more
that
the
rest
for
i
knew
the
voice
mary
magna
had
taken
another
speaking
part
i
was
on
the
steps
of
the
building
so
i
could
see
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
there
were
four
of
the
big
busses
from
eternal
city
two
having
approached
from
each
direction
some
fifty
figures
had
descended
from
them
and
others
were
still
descending
each
one
clad
in
a
voluminous
white
robe
with
a
white
hood
over
the
head
and
two
black
holes
for
eyes
and
another
for
the
nose
these
figures
had
spread
out
in
a
half
moon
entirely
surrounding
the
little
mob
of
men
and
penning
them
against
the
wall
of
the
building
in
the
center
of
the
half
moon
standing
a
few
feet
in
advance
was
the
figure
of
the
grand
imperial
kleagle
with
a
red
star
upon
the
forehead
of
the
white
hood
and
shrouded
white
arms
stretched
out
and
in
one
hand
a
magic
wand
with
a
red
light
on
the
end
this
wand
was
waving
over
the
brigade
members
and
had
apparently
its
full
supernatural
effect
for
one
and
all
they
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
staring
with
eyes
lvii
the
voice
raised
again
its
silver
chant
give
way
all
mobs
yield
retire
abdicate
bow
make
way
for
the
mob
of
mobs
the
irresistible
imperial
superior
hearken
to
the
lord
high
chief
commanding
dragon
of
the
esoteric
cohorts
the
exalted
immortal
grand
imperial
kleagle
of
the
ku
klux
klan
then
the
grand
imperial
kleagle
turned
and
addressed
the
throng
in
a
voice
of
sharp
command
klansmen
remember
your
oath
the
hour
of
judgment
is
here
the
guilty
wretch
cowers
the
grand
insuperable
sentence
has
been
spoken

klansmen

as

the
host
fell
upon
its
knees
klansmen
swear
si

ferient

you
have
heard
the
sentence
what
is
the
penalty
is
it
death
and
a
voice
in
the
crowd
cried
death
and
the
others
took
it
up
there
was
a
roar
death
death
said
the
grand
imperial
kleagle
arma
virumque
cano
tou
poluphlesboiou
thalasses
then
facing
the
staring
tetlathi
mater
erne
kai
anaskeo
finally
the
grand
imperial
kleagle
pointed
her
shrouded
white
arm
at
carpenter
who
stood
as
pale
as
death
but
unflinchingly
death
to
all
traitors
she
cried
death
to
all
agitators
death
to
all
enemies
of
the
ku
klux
klan
condemnatus
incomparabilis
ingenientis
exequatur
let
the
loyal
high
inexorable
guardians
and
the
grand
holy
seneschals
of
the
klan
advance
six
shrouded
figures
stepped
out
from
the
crowd
said
the
grand
imperial
kleagle
possess
yourselves
of
the
body
of
this
guilty
wretch
and
to
the
yield
up
this
varlet
to
the
high
secret
of
the
klan
which
alone
has
power
to
punish
such
as
what
the
bewildered
members
of
the
brigade
made
of
all
this
i
had
no
idea
afterwards
when
the
adventure
was
over
i
asked
mary
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
that
stuff
and
she
told
me
how
she
had
once
acted
in
a
children
comedy
in
which
there
was
an
old
magician
who
spent
his
time
putting
spells
on
people
she
had
had
to
witness
his
incantations
eight
or
ten
times
a
week
for
nearly
a
year
so
of
course
the
phrases
had
got
fixed
in
her
memory
and
they
had
served
just
as
well
to
impress
these
children
or
perhaps
the
thought
this
might
be
a
further
plan
of
those
who
had
employed
them
whatever
they
thought
it
was
obvious
that
they
were
hopelessly
outnumbered
there
could
be
nothing
for
a
mob
to
do
but
yield
to
a
and
they
yielded
those
who
were
in
front
of
carpenter
stepped
back
and
the
loyal
high
inexorable
guardians
and
the
grand
holy
seneschals
took
carpenter
by
the
arms
and
led
him
away
apparently
they
were
going
to
overlook
the
rest
of
us
but
old
joe
and
lynch
and
myself
took
abell
and
moneta
by
the
shoulders
and
shoved
them
along
past
the
men
and
into
the
midst
of
the
there
was
no
need
to
consider
dignity
after
that
we
hustled
carpenter
to
the
nearest
of
the
busses
and
put
him
in
the
grand
imperial
kleagle
followed
and
the
rest
of
us
clambered
in
after
her
sitting
up
beside
the
driver
watching
the
scene
was
beaming
with
delight
he
got
me
by
the
hand
and
wrung
it
i
could
not
speak
my
teeth
were
literally
chattering
with
excitement
carpenter
sitting
in
the
seat
behind
us
must
have
realized
by
now
the
meaning
of
this
scandalous
adventure
but
he
said
not
a
word
and
the
klansmen
piled
in
behind
him
and
the
siren
shrieked
out
into
the
night
and
the
bus
backed
to
the
corner
and
turned
and
sped
off
and
all
the
way
to
eternal
city
and
i
and
old
joe
slapped
one
another
on
the
back
and
roared
with
laughter
and
the
rest
of
the
klansmen
roared
with
laughter
all
save
the
grand
imperial
kleagle
who
sat
by
carpenter
side
and
was
discovered
to
be
weeping
lviii
and
i
had
exchanged
a
few
whispered
words
and
decided
that
we
would
take
carpenter
to
his
place
which
was
a
few
miles
in
the
country
from
eternal
city
he
would
be
as
safe
there
as
anywhere
i
could
think
of
when
we
had
got
to
the
studios
we
discharged
our
klansmen
and
arranged
to
send
old
joe
to
his
home
and
the
three
disciples
to
a
hotel
for
the
night
then
i
invited
carpenter
to
step
into
car
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
and
all
he
said
now
was
i
wish
to
be
i
answered
i
am
taking
you
to
a
place
where
you
may
be
alone
as
long
as
you
so
he
entered
the
car
and
a
few
minutes
later
and
i
were
escorting
him
into
the
latter
showy
mansion
we
were
getting
to
be
rather
scared
now
for
carpenter
silence
was
forbidding
but
again
he
said
i
wish
to
be
we
took
him
upstairs
to
a
and
shut
him
in
and
left
him
but
taking
the
precaution
to
lock
the
door
downstairs
we
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
feeling
like
two
who
had
been
playing
truant
and
would
soon
have
to
face
the
teacher
you
stay
here
billy
insisted
the
magnate
you
got
ta
see
him
in
de
mornin
i
vo
i
stay
i
said
and
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
after
one
give
me
an
i
said
because
carpenter
wakes
with
the
birds
and
we
do
want
him
escaping
by
the
so
it
came
about
that
at
daybreak
i
tapped
on
carpenter
door
softly
so
as
not
to
waken
him
if
he
were
asleep
but
he
answered
come
in
and
i
entered
and
found
him
sitting
by
the
window
watching
the
dawn
i
stood
timidly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
began
i
realize
of
course
carpenter
that
i
have
taken
a
very
great
liberty
with
you
you
have
said
it
he
replied
and
his
eyes
were
awful
but
i
persisted
if
you
knew
what
danger
you
were
in
said
he
do
you
think
that
i
came
to
mobland
to
look
for
a
comfortable
life
but
i
pleaded
if
you
only
knew
that
particular
gang
do
you
realize
that
they
had
planted
an
infernal
machine
a
dynamite
bomb
in
that
room
and
all
the
world
was
to
read
in
the
newspapers
this
morning
that
you
had
been
conspiring
to
blow
up
somebody
said
carpenter
would
it
have
been
the
first
time
that
i
have
been
lied
about
of
course
i
argued
i
know
what
i
have
done
you
can
have
no
idea
what
you
have
done
you
are
too
i
bowed
my
head
prepared
to
take
my
punishment
but
at
once
carpenter
voice
softened
you
are
a
part
of
mobland
he
said
you
can
not
help
yourself
in
mobland
it
is
not
possible
for
even
a
martyrdom
to
proceed
in
an
orderly
i
gazed
at
him
a
moment
bewildered
what
the
good
of
a
martyrdom
i
cried
the
good
is
that
men
can
be
moved
in
no
other
way
they
are
in
that
childish
stage
of
being
where
they
require
blood
but
what
kind
of
martyrdom
i
argued
so
undignified
and
unimpressive
to
have
hot
tar
smeared
over
your
body
and
be
hanged
by
the
neck
like
a
common
criminal
i
realized
that
this
last
phrase
was
unfortunate
said
carpenter
i
am
used
to
being
treated
as
a
common
well
said
i
in
a
voice
of
despair
of
course
if
absolutely
bent
on
being
hanged
if
you
ca
think
of
anything
you
would
prefer
i
stopped
for
i
saw
that
he
had
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
in
the
silence
i
heard
him
whisper
i
prayed
last
night
that
this
cup
might
pass
from
me
and
apparently
my
prayer
has
been
well
i
said
deciding
to
cheer
up
you
see
i
have
only
been
playing
the
part
of
providence
let
me
play
it
just
a
few
days
longer
until
this
mob
of
crazy
has
got
out
of
town
again
i
am
truly
ashamed
for
them
but
i
am
one
of
them
myself
so
i
understand
them
they
really
fought
and
won
a
war
you
see
and
they
are
full
of
the
madness
of
it
the
blind
intense
passions
carpenter
was
on
his
feet
i
know
he
exclaimed
i
know
you
need
not
tell
me
about
that
i
do
not
blame
your
i
blame
the
men
who
incite
them
the
old
men
the
men
who
sit
back
in
and
plan
madness
for
the
world
what
shall
be
the
punishment
of
these
men
they
a
hard
crowd
i
admitted
i
have
seen
them
they
are
men
they
are
wolves
with
machinery
they
are
savages
with
polished
fingernails
and
they
have
made
of
the
land
a
place
of
fools
they
have
made
it
mobland
i
did
not
try
to
answer
him
but
waited
until
the
storm
of
his
emotion
passed
you
are
right
carpenter
but
that
is
the
fact
about
our
world
and
you
can
not
change
it
carpenter
flung
out
his
arm
at
me
let
no
man
utter
in
my
presence
the
supreme
blasphemy
against
life
so
of
course
i
was
silent
and
carpenter
went
and
sat
at
the
window
again
and
watched
the
dawn
at
last
i
ventured
all
that
your
friends
ask
carpenter
is
that
you
will
wait
until
this
convention
of
the
has
got
out
of
town
after
that
it
may
be
possible
to
get
people
to
listen
to
you
but
while
the
brigade
is
here
it
is
impossible
they
are
rough
and
they
are
wild
they
are
taking
possession
of
the
city
and
will
do
what
they
please
if
they
see
you
on
the
streets
they
will
inflict
indignities
upon
you
they
will
mishandle
you
said
carpenter
do
not
fear
those
who
kill
the
body
but
fear
those
who
kill
the
so
again
i
fell
silent
and
presently
he
remarked
my
brother
i
wish
to
be
said
i
wo
you
please
promise
carpenter
he
answered
i
make
promises
only
to
my
father
let
me
lix
i
went
downstairs
and
there
was
wandering
around
like
a
big
fat
monk
in
a
purple
dressing
gown
and
there
was
maw
also
only
her
dressing
gown
was
with
white
chrysanthemums
on
it
it
took
a
lot
to
get
those
two
awake
at
six
in
the
morning
you
may
be
sure
but
there
they
were
very
much
worried
vot
does
he
say
cried
the
magnate
he
wo
say
what
he
is
going
to
he
vo
promise
to
stay
he
wo
promise
vell
did
you
lock
de
door
i
answered
that
i
had
and
then
maw
put
in
in
a
hurry
billy
you
got
ta
stay
here
and
take
care
of
him
if
he
vas
to
gome
downstairs
and
tell
me
to
do
someting
i
vould
got
to
do
it
i
promised
and
a
little
later
they
got
ready
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
glass
of
milk
and
some
rolls
and
butter
and
fruit
and
i
had
the
job
of
taking
up
the
tray
and
setting
it
in
the
prophet
room
when
i
came
in
i
tried
to
say
cheerfully
here
your
breakfast
and
not
to
show
any
trace
of
my
uneasiness
carpenter
looked
at
me
and
said
you
had
the
door
locked
i
summoned
my
nerve
and
answered
said
he
what
is
the
difference
to
me
between
being
your
prisoner
and
being
the
prisoner
of
your
rulers
said
i
mr
carpenter
the
difference
is
that
we
do
intend
to
hang
and
how
long
do
you
propose
to
keep
me
here
for
about
four
days
i
said
until
the
convention
disbands
if
you
will
only
give
me
your
word
to
wait
that
time
you
may
have
the
freedom
of
this
beautiful
place
and
when
the
period
is
over
i
pledge
you
every
help
i
can
give
to
make
known
your
message
to
the
i
waited
for
an
answer
but
none
came
so
i
set
down
the
tray
and
went
out
locking
the
door
again
and
downstairs
was
one
of
secretaries
with
copies
of
the
morning
newspapers
and
i
picked
up
a
times
and
there
was
a
headline
all
the
way
across
the
page
ku
klux
klan
kidnaps
karpenter
ranting
red
prophet
disappears
in
tooting
autos
i
understood
of
course
that
the
secret
agency
which
had
engineered
the
mobbing
of
the
prophet
would
have
had
their
stories
all
ready
for
our
morning
newspapers
stories
which
played
up
to
the
full
the
finding
of
an
infernal
machine
and
an
unprovoked
attack
upon
men
by
the
armed
followers
of
the
red
but
now
all
this
was
gone
and
instead
was
a
story
glorifying
the
klansmen
as
the
saviors
of
the
city
good
name
it
was
evident
that
up
to
the
hour
of
going
to
press
neither
of
the
two
newspapers
had
any
idea
but
that
the
white
robed
figures
were
genuine
followers
of
the
grand
imperial
the
times
carried
at
the
top
of
its
editorial
page
a
brief
comment
in
large
type
congratulating
the
people
of
western
city
upon
the
promptness
with
which
they
had
demonstrated
their
devotion
to
the
cause
of
law
and
order
but
of
course
the
truth
about
our
mob
could
not
be
kept
very
long
when
you
have
hired
a
hundred
actors
to
share
in
the
greatest
mystery
of
the
age
it
will
not
be
many
hours
before
your
secret
has
got
to
the
newspaper
offices
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
two
hours
before
the
evening
blare
was
calling
the
home
of
the
movie
magnate
to
inquire
where
he
had
taken
the
kidnapped
prophet
there
was
no
use
trying
to
deny
anything
said
the
editor
diplomatically
because
too
many
people
had
seen
the
prophet
transferred
to
automobile
of
course
secretary
who
answered
the
phone
lied
valiantly
but
here
again
we
knew
the
truth
would
leak
there
were
servants
and
chauffeurs
and
gardeners
and
all
of
them
knew
that
the
white
robed
mystery
was
somewhere
on
the
place
they
would
be
offered
endless
bribes
and
some
of
them
would
accept
in
the
course
of
the
next
hour
or
two
there
were
a
dozen
newspaper
reporters
besieging
the
mansion
and
camera
men
taking
pictures
of
it
and
even
spying
with
opera
glasses
from
a
distance
before
my
mind
eye
flashed
new
headlines
movie
magnate
hides
mob
prophet
from
law
this
was
an
aspect
of
the
matter
which
we
had
at
first
overlooked
carpenter
was
due
at
judge
ponty
at
nine
that
morning
was
he
going
demanded
the
reporters
and
if
not
why
not
mary
magna
no
doubt
would
be
willing
to
sacrifice
the
two
hundred
dollars
bail
that
she
had
put
up
but
the
judge
had
a
right
to
issue
a
bench
warrant
and
send
a
deputy
for
the
prisoner
would
he
do
it
behind
the
scenes
of
western
city
government
there
began
forthwith
a
tremendous
diplomatic
duel
who
it
was
that
wanted
carpenter
dragged
out
of
his
we
could
not
be
sure
but
we
knew
who
it
was
that
wanted
him
to
stay
hidden
i
called
up
my
uncle
timothy
and
explained
the
situation
it
was
worth
while
for
him
to
waste
his
breath
scolding
i
was
going
to
stand
by
my
prophet
if
he
wanted
to
put
an
end
to
the
scandal
let
him
do
what
he
could
to
see
that
the
prophet
was
let
alone
but
billy
what
can
i
do
he
cried
it
a
matter
of
the
i
answered
fudge
you
know
perfectly
well
there
no
magistrate
or
judge
in
this
city
that
wo
do
what
he
told
if
the
right
people
tell
him
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
get
busy
with
de
wiggs
and
westerly
and
carson
and
the
rest
of
the
big
gang
and
persuade
them
that
there
nothing
to
be
gained
by
dragging
carpenter
out
of
his
what
did
they
want
anyway
i
argued
they
wanted
the
agitation
stopped
well
we
had
stopped
it
and
without
any
bloodshed
if
they
dragged
the
prophet
out
from
concealment
and
into
a
police
court
they
would
only
have
more
excitement
more
tumult
ending
nobody
could
tell
how
i
called
up
several
other
people
who
might
have
influence
and
meanwhile
was
over
at
his
office
in
eternal
city
pleading
over
the
telephone
with
the
editors
of
afternoon
papers
they
had
got
the
red
prophet
out
of
the
way
during
the
convention
and
why
they
let
well
enough
alone
was
there
news
enough
with
five
or
ten
thousand
coming
to
town
without
bothering
about
one
poor
religious
freak
when
you
shoot
a
load
of
shot
at
a
duck
and
the
bird
comes
tumbling
down
you
do
not
bother
to
ask
which
particular
shot
it
was
that
hit
the
target
and
so
it
was
with
these
frantic
efforts
of
ours
one
shot
must
have
hit
for
at
eleven
that
morning
when
the
case
of
john
doe
carpenter
versus
the
commonwealth
of
western
city
was
reached
in
judge
ponty
court
and
the
bailiff
called
the
name
of
the
defendant
and
there
was
no
answer
the
magistrate
in
a
single
sentence
declared
the
bail
forfeited
and
passed
on
to
the
next
case
without
a
word
and
all
three
of
our
afternoon
newspapers
reported
this
incident
in
an
obscure
corner
on
an
inside
page
the
red
prophet
was
dead
and
buried
ix
i
took
up
carpenter
lunch
at
one
and
discovered
to
my
dismay
that
he
had
not
tasted
his
breakfast
i
ventured
to
speak
to
him
but
he
sat
on
a
chair
gazing
ahead
of
him
and
paying
no
attention
to
me
so
i
left
him
alone
at
six
in
the
evening
i
took
up
his
dinner
and
discovered
that
he
had
not
touched
either
breakfast
or
lunch
but
still
he
had
nothing
to
say
so
i
took
back
the
dinner
and
went
downstairs
and
said
to
we
got
ourselves
in
for
a
hunger
strike
needless
to
say
under
the
circumstances
we
did
not
very
heartily
enjoy
our
own
dinner
and
neglecting
his
important
business
stayed
around
getting
up
out
of
one
chair
and
walking
nowhere
and
then
sitting
down
in
another
chair
i
did
the
same
and
after
we
had
exchanged
chairs
a
dozen
times
it
being
then
about
eight
in
the
evening
i
said
by
the
way
had
you
better
call
up
the
morning
papers
and
persuade
them
to
be
so
seated
himself
at
the
telephone
and
asked
for
the
managing
editor
of
the
western
city
times
and
i
sat
and
listened
to
the
conversation
it
began
with
a
reminder
of
the
amount
of
advertising
space
which
eternal
city
consumed
in
the
times
in
the
course
of
a
year
and
also
the
amount
of
its
payroll
in
the
community
it
was
often
that
asked
favors
but
he
wanted
to
ask
one
now
he
wanted
the
times
to
let
up
on
this
prophet
business
and
especially
about
the
prophet
connection
with
the
moving
picture
industry
everything
was
quiet
now
the
prophet
was
bothering
anybody
suddenly
at
the
height
of
his
eloquence
stopped
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
he
jumped
a
foot
out
of
his
chair
vot
and
then
vy
man
you
crazy
he
turned
upon
me
his
eyes
wide
with
dismay
billy
dey
got
a
report
carpenter
is
shoost
now
speakin
to
a
mob
on
de
steps
of
de
city
hall
the
magnate
did
not
wait
to
see
me
jump
out
of
my
chair
or
to
hear
my
exclamations
but
turned
again
to
the
telephone
my
gawd
man
vot
do
i
know
about
it
de
feller
vas
up
in
his
room
two
hours
ago
ven
we
took
him
his
dinner
he
vould
eat
it
he
vould
speak
that
was
the
last
i
heard
having
bolted
out
of
the
room
and
upstairs
i
found
carpenter
door
locked
i
opened
it
and
rushed
in
the
place
was
empty
the
bird
had
flown
how
had
he
got
out
had
he
climbed
through
the
window
and
slid
down
a
in
his
prophetic
robes
had
he
won
the
heart
of
some
servant
had
some
newspaper
reporter
or
agent
of
our
enemies
used
bribery
i
rushed
downstairs
and
got
my
car
from
the
garage
and
all
the
way
to
the
city
i
spent
my
time
in
such
futile
speculations
how
carpenter
having
escaped
from
the
house
had
managed
to
get
into
town
so
quickly
that
was
much
easier
to
figure
out
for
our
highways
are
full
of
motor
traffic
and
almost
any
driver
will
take
in
a
stranger
i
came
to
the
city
even
outside
the
crowded
district
the
traffic
was
held
up
for
a
minute
or
two
at
every
corner
so
i
found
time
to
look
about
and
to
realize
that
the
brigade
had
got
to
town
all
day
special
trains
had
been
pouring
into
the
city
literally
dozens
of
them
by
every
road
and
now
the
streets
were
thronged
with
men
in
uniform
marching
arm
in
arm
shouting
chanting
roaming
in
search
of
adventure
tomorrow
was
the
first
day
of
the
convention
the
day
of
the
big
parade
tonight
was
a
night
of
riot
everything
in
town
was
free
to
men
and
to
all
others
who
could
borrow
or
buy
a
uniform
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
was
set
forth
in
a
notice
published
on
the
editorial
page
of
the
times
hello
bo
have
a
cigarette
take
another
one
take
anything
you
see
around
the
place
the
town
is
yours
take
it
into
camp
with
you
scruff
it
up
to
your
heart
content
order
it
about
let
it
carry
grub
to
you
have
it
shine
your
shoes
hand
it
your
coat
and
tell
it
to
hold
it
until
the
show
is
over
we
are
all
waiting
your
orders
shove
us
back
if
we
crowd
push
us
off
the
street
give
us
your
grip
and
tell
us
where
to
deliver
it
any
errands
call
us
if
you
want
to
go
anywhere
do
ask
for
directions
just
jump
into
the
car
and
tell
us
where
you
bound
for
let
have
another
one
before
we
part
put
up
your
money
it
no
good
here
this
one
on
western
i
saw
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
possible
to
drive
through
the
jam
so
i
put
my
car
in
a
parking
place
and
set
out
for
the
city
hall
on
foot
on
the
way
i
observed
that
the
invitation
of
the
times
had
been
accepted
the
brigade
had
taken
possession
of
the
town
it
was
just
about
possible
to
walk
on
the
streets
there
were
solid
masses
of
noisy
pushing
people
every
other
man
in
uniform
evidently
there
had
been
a
tacit
agreement
to
repeal
the
eighteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
for
the
next
three
days
bootleggers
had
drawn
up
their
trucks
and
automobiles
along
the
curbs
and
otherwise
known
as
white
lightnin
was
freely
sold
you
would
meet
a
man
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand
and
the
effects
of
other
bottles
in
his
face
who
would
embrace
you
and
offer
you
a
drink
in
the
same
block
you
would
meet
another
man
who
would
invite
you
to
buy
drinks
for
everybody
in
sight
the
town
had
apparently
agreed
that
no
invitation
should
be
declined
if
the
great
republic
of
mobland
had
been
unable
to
make
for
its
returned
the
new
world
which
it
had
promised
them
if
it
could
not
even
give
them
back
the
jobs
they
had
had
before
they
left
surely
the
least
it
could
do
was
to
get
them
drunk
and
several
times
in
each
block
you
would
have
to
get
off
the
sidewalk
for
a
group
of
ten
or
twenty
flushed
dishevelled
men
playing
the
great
national
game
of
craps
roll
the
bones
they
would
shout
completely
ignoring
the
throngs
which
surged
about
them
each
had
his
pile
of
bills
and
silver
laid
out
on
the
pavement
and
his
bottle
of
white
lightnin
now
and
then
one
would
take
a
swig
and
now
and
then
one
would
start
singing
all
we
do
is
sign
the
and
we
do
get
a
goddam
cent
you
would
go
a
little
farther
and
find
a
couple
of
automobiles
trying
to
get
past
and
a
merry
crowd
amusing
itself
throwing
large
waste
cans
in
front
of
them
some
one
would
shout
who
won
the
war
and
the
answer
would
come
booming
the
goddam
slackers
or
maybe
it
would
be
the
goddam
the
crowd
would
move
along
starting
to
chant
the
favorite
refrain
you
in
the
army
now
you
not
behind
the
plow
you
you
never
get
rich
you
in
the
army
now
and
from
farther
down
the
street
would
come
a
chorus
from
another
crowd
of
marchers
i
got
a
girl
in
baltimore
the
runs
right
by
her
door
every
now
and
then
you
would
come
on
a
or
maybe
a
fight
with
bottles
and
a
crowd
laughing
and
whooping
engaged
in
pulling
the
warriors
apart
and
sitting
on
them
through
a
mile
or
two
of
this
kind
of
thing
i
made
my
way
my
heart
sinking
deeper
with
misgiving
i
got
within
a
couple
of
blocks
of
the
city
hall
and
then
suddenly
i
came
upon
the
thing
i
dreaded
my
friend
carpenter
in
the
hands
of
the
mob
lxi
they
had
got
hold
of
a
wagon
of
the
type
of
the
old
you
still
find
these
camped
by
our
roadsides
now
and
then
with
nomad
families
in
them
and
evidently
one
of
these
families
had
been
so
ill
advised
as
to
come
to
town
for
the
convention
the
rioters
had
hoisted
their
victim
on
top
of
the
wagon
having
first
dumped
a
gallon
of
red
paint
over
his
head
so
that
everyone
might
know
him
for
the
red
prophet
they
had
been
reading
about
in
the
papers
they
had
tied
a
long
rope
to
the
shaft
of
the
wagon
and
one
or
two
hundred
men
had
hold
of
it
and
were
hauling
it
through
the
streets
dancing
and
singing
shouting
against
the
some
ran
ahead
to
clear
the
traffic
and
then
came
the
wagon
lumbering
and
rocking
so
that
the
prophet
was
thrown
from
side
to
side
fortunately
there
was
a
hole
in
the
canvas
and
he
could
hold
to
one
of
the
wooden
ribs
the
cortege
came
opposite
to
me
on
each
side
was
a
guard
of
honor
a
line
of
men
walking
in
each
with
his
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
the
one
in
front
they
had
got
up
a
sort
of
chant
hi
hi
the
bolsheviki
prophet
hi
hi
the
bolsheviki
prophet
and
others
would
yell
i
wo
work
i
wo
work
this
being
our
mobland
nickname
for
the
some
one
had
daubed
the
letters
on
the
sides
of
the
wagon
using
the
red
paint
and
a
drunken
fellow
standing
near
me
shook
his
clenched
fist
at
the
wretch
on
top
and
bellowed
in
a
voice
hey
there
you
goddam
arnychist
if
you
a
prophet
come
down
from
that
there
wagon
and
cure
my
venereal
disease
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
from
the
throng
and
the
drunken
fellow
liked
the
sensation
so
well
that
he
walked
alongside
shouting
his
challenge
again
and
again
then
i
heard
a
crash
behind
me
and
a
clatter
of
falling
glass
i
turned
to
see
a
soldier
inside
the
royal
hotel
engaged
in
chopping
out
the
window
of
the
lobby
with
a
chair
there
were
twenty
or
thirty
uniformed
men
behind
him
who
wanted
to
get
out
and
see
the
fun
but
the
door
of
the
hotel
was
blocked
by
the
crowd
so
they
were
seeking
a
direct
route
to
the
goal
of
their
desires
i
knew
of
course
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
one
might
as
well
have
tried
to
stop
a
hurricane
by
blowing
one
breath
carpenter
had
wanted
martyrdom
and
now
he
was
going
to
get
it
of
the
peculiar
kind
and
in
the
peculiar
fashion
of
our
free
and
independent
and
land
we
have
had
many
agitators
and
disturbers
of
our
and
they
have
all
got
theirs
in
one
form
or
another
but
there
had
never
been
one
who
had
done
quite
so
much
to
make
himself
odious
as
this
bolsheviki
prophet
who
was
now
getting
treat
rough
runs
the
formula
of
the
army
and
i
fell
in
step
watching
and
thinking
that
later
i
might
serve
as
one
of
the
half
way
down
the
block
we
came
to
the
palace
hotel
and
uniformed
men
came
pouring
out
of
that
i
heard
the
shrieks
of
a
woman
and
put
my
foot
on
the
edge
of
a
and
raised
myself
up
by
an
awning
to
see
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
half
a
dozen
rowdies
had
got
hold
of
a
girl
i
do
know
what
she
had
done
maybe
her
skirts
were
too
short
or
maybe
she
had
been
saucy
to
one
of
the
gang
anyhow
they
were
tearing
her
clothes
to
shreds
and
having
done
this
gaily
they
took
her
on
their
shoulders
and
ran
her
out
to
the
wagon
and
tossed
her
up
beside
the
red
prophet
there
a
girl
for
you
they
yelled
and
the
drunken
fellow
who
wanted
carpenter
to
cure
him
suddenly
thought
of
a
new
witticism
hey
you
goddam
bolsheviki
why
do
you
nationalize
her
men
laughed
and
whooped
over
that
some
of
them
were
so
tickled
that
they
danced
about
and
waved
their
arms
in
the
air
for
you
see
they
knew
all
the
details
concerning
the
nationalization
of
women
in
russia
and
also
they
had
read
in
the
papers
about
mary
magna
and
fondness
for
and
other
gay
ladies
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
the
girl
to
save
her
from
falling
off
and
at
this
there
went
up
such
a
roar
from
the
mob
that
it
made
me
think
of
wild
beasts
in
the
arena
so
to
my
whirling
brain
came
back
the
words
that
carpenter
had
spoken
it
is
rome
it
is
rome
rome
that
never
dies
the
cortege
came
to
the
hippodrome
which
is
our
biggest
theatre
and
which
like
everything
else
had
declared
open
house
for
brigade
members
during
the
convention
some
one
in
the
crowd
evidently
knew
the
building
and
guided
the
procession
down
a
side
street
to
the
they
have
all
kinds
of
shows
in
the
hippodrome
and
have
a
driveway
by
which
they
bring
in
automobiles
or
or
wild
animals
in
cages
or
whatever
they
will
now
the
mob
stormed
the
entrance
and
brushed
the
to
one
side
and
unbolted
and
swung
back
the
big
gates
and
a
swarm
of
yelling
maniacs
rushed
the
lumbering
up
the
slope
into
the
building
the
unlucky
girl
rolled
off
at
this
point
and
somebody
caught
her
and
mercifully
carried
her
to
one
side
the
wagon
rolled
on
the
advance
guard
swept
everything
out
of
the
way
scenery
as
well
as
and
actors
and
to
the
vast
astonishment
of
an
audience
of
a
couple
of
thousand
people
the
long
string
of
marched
across
the
stage
and
after
them
came
the
vehicle
with
the
letters
and
the
victim
clinging
to
the
top
the
swarm
gathered
about
him
raising
their
deafening
chant
hi
hi
the
bolsheviki
prophet
hi
hi
the
bolsheviki
prophet
i
had
got
near
enough
so
that
i
could
see
what
happened
i
know
whether
carpenter
fainted
anyhow
he
slipped
from
his
perch
and
a
score
of
upraised
hands
caught
him
some
one
tore
down
a
hanging
from
the
walls
of
the
stage
set
and
twenty
or
thirty
men
formed
a
cirfcle
about
it
and
put
the
prophet
in
the
middle
of
it
and
began
to
toss
him
ten
feet
up
into
the
air
and
catch
him
and
throw
him
again
and
that
was
all
i
could
stand
i
turned
and
went
out
by
the
rear
entrance
of
the
theatre
the
street
in
back
was
deserted
i
stood
there
with
my
hands
clasped
to
my
head
sick
with
disgust
i
found
myself
repeating
out
loud
over
and
over
again
those
words
of
carpenter
it
is
rome
it
is
rome
rome
that
never
dies
a
moment
later
i
heard
a
crash
of
glass
up
above
me
i
ducked
just
in
time
to
avoid
a
shower
of
it
then
i
looked
up
and
to
my
consternation
saw
the
head
and
the
red
and
white
shoulders
of
carpenter
suddenly
emerging
the
shoulders
were
quickly
followed
by
the
rest
of
him
but
fortunately
there
was
a
narrow
shed
between
him
and
the
ground
he
struck
the
shed
and
rolled
and
as
he
fell
i
caught
him
and
let
him
down
without
harm
lxii
i
expected
to
find
my
prophet
nearly
dead
i
made
ready
to
get
him
onto
my
shoulders
and
find
some
place
to
hide
him
but
to
my
surprise
he
started
to
his
feet
i
could
not
see
much
of
him
because
of
the
streams
of
paint
but
i
could
see
enough
to
realize
that
his
face
was
contorted
with
fury
i
remembered
that
gentle
compassionate
countenance
never
had
i
dreamed
to
see
it
like
this
he
raised
his
clenched
hands
i
meant
to
die
for
this
people
but
now
let
them
die
for
themselves
and
suddenly
he
reached
out
to
me
in
a
gesture
of
frenzy
let
me
get
away
from
them
anywhere
anyway
let
me
go
back
where
i
was
where
i
do
not
see
where
i
do
not
hear
where
i
do
not
think
let
me
go
back
to
the
church
with
these
words
he
started
to
run
down
the
street
hauling
up
his
long
robes
never
would
i
have
dreamed
that
a
prophet
bare
legs
could
flash
so
quickly
that
he
could
cover
the
ground
at
such
amazing
speed
i
set
out
after
him
i
had
stuck
to
him
thus
far
and
meant
to
be
in
at
the
finish
whatever
it
was
we
came
out
on
broadway
again
and
there
were
more
crowds
of
soldier
boys
the
prophet
sped
past
them
like
a
dog
with
a
tied
to
its
tail
he
came
to
a
and
dodged
the
crowded
traffic
and
i
also
got
through
knocking
pedestrians
this
way
and
that
people
shouted
automobiles
tooted
the
soldiers
whooped
on
the
trail
i
began
to
get
short
of
breath
a
little
dizzy
the
buildings
seemed
to
rock
before
me
there
were
mobs
everywhere
and
hands
clutching
at
me
nearly
upsetting
me
but
still
i
followed
my
prophet
with
the
bare
flying
legs
we
swept
around
another
corner
and
i
saw
the
goal
to
which
the
tormented
soul
was
racing
bartholomew
he
went
up
the
steps
three
at
a
time
and
i
went
up
four
at
a
time
behind
him
he
flung
open
the
door
and
vanished
inside
when
i
got
in
he
was
half
way
up
the
aisle
i
saw
people
in
the
church
start
up
with
cries
of
amazement
some
grabbed
me
but
i
broke
away
and
saw
my
prophet
give
three
tremendous
leaps
the
first
took
him
up
the
the
second
took
him
onto
the
altar
the
third
took
him
up
into
the
window
and
there
he
turned
and
faced
me
his
robes
fell
down
about
his
bare
legs
his
convulsed
and
angry
face
became
as
gentle
and
compassionate
as
the
paint
would
permit
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
signalled
me
to
stand
back
and
let
him
alone
then
the
hand
sank
to
his
side
and
he
stood
motionless
exhausted
dizzy
i
fell
against
one
of
the
pews
and
then
into
a
seat
and
bowed
my
head
in
my
arms
lxiii
i
do
know
just
how
much
time
passed
after
that
i
felt
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
realized
that
some
one
was
shaking
me
i
had
a
horror
of
hands
reaching
out
for
me
so
i
tried
to
get
away
from
this
one
but
it
persisted
and
there
was
a
voice
saying
you
must
get
up
my
friend
it
time
we
closed
are
you
ill
i
raised
my
head
and
first
i
glanced
at
the
figure
above
the
altar
it
was
perfectly
motionless
and
incredible
as
it
may
seem
there
was
no
trace
of
red
paint
upon
either
the
face
or
the
robes
the
figure
was
dignified
and
serene
with
a
halo
of
light
about
its
head
in
short
it
was
the
regulation
stained
glass
figure
that
i
had
gazed
at
through
all
my
childhood
what
is
the
matter
asked
the
voice
at
my
side
and
i
looked
up
and
discovered
the
reverend
simpkinson
he
recognized
me
and
cried
why
billy
for
heaven
sake
what
has
happened
i
was
dazed
and
put
my
hand
to
my
jaw
i
realized
that
my
head
was
aching
and
that
the
place
i
touched
was
sore
i
i
i
stammered
wait
a
and
then
i
think
i
was
i
tried
to
get
my
thoughts
together
had
i
been
dreaming
and
if
so
how
much
was
dream
and
how
much
was
reality
tell
me
i
said
is
there
a
moving
picture
theatre
near
this
church
why
yes
said
he
the
and
was
there
some
sort
of
riot
yes
some
have
been
trying
to
keep
people
from
going
in
there
they
are
still
at
it
you
can
hear
i
listened
yes
there
was
a
murmur
of
voices
outside
so
i
realized
what
had
happened
to
me
i
said
i
was
in
that
mob
and
i
got
beaten
up
i
was
knocked
pretty
nearly
silly
and
fled
in
dear
me
exclaimed
the
clergyman
his
amiable
face
full
of
concern
he
took
me
by
my
shoulders
and
helped
me
to
my
feet
i
all
right
now
i
said
except
that
my
jaw
is
swollen
tell
me
what
time
is
it
about
six
for
goodness
sake
i
exclaimed
i
dreamed
all
that
in
an
hour
i
had
the
strangest
dream
even
now
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
what
was
dream
and
what
really
i
thought
for
a
moment
tell
me
is
there
a
convention
of
the
brigade
that
is
i
mean
of
the
american
legion
in
western
city
now
no
said
the
other
at
least
not
that
i
heard
of
just
held
their
big
convention
in
kansas
oh
i
see
i
remember
i
read
about
it
in
the
they
were
pretty
riotous
made
a
drunken
orgy
of
yes
said
the
clergyman
i
heard
that
it
seems
too
one
thing
more
tell
me
is
there
a
picture
of
de
wiggs
in
the
good
gracious
no
laughed
the
other
was
that
one
of
the
things
you
dreamed
maybe
you
thinking
of
the
portrait
they
are
showing
at
the
by
george
that
it
i
said
i
patched
the
thing
up
out
of
all
the
people
i
know
and
all
the
things
i
read
in
the
papers
i
had
been
talking
to
a
german
critic
henner
or
wait
a
moment
is
he
real
yes
he
came
before
i
went
to
see
the
picture
he
be
entertained
to
hear
about
it
you
see
the
picture
was
supposed
to
be
the
delirium
of
a
madman
and
when
i
got
this
whack
on
the
jaw
i
set
to
work
to
have
a
delirium
of
my
own
just
as
i
had
seen
on
the
screen
it
was
the
most
amazing
thing
so
real
i
mean
every
person
i
think
of
i
have
to
stop
and
make
sure
whether
i
really
know
them
or
whether
i
dreamed
them
even
you
was
i
in
it
laughed
simpkinson
what
did
i
do
but
i
decided
i
better
not
tell
him
it
was
a
polite
dream
i
said
let
me
see
if
i
can
walk
i
started
down
the
aisle
yes
i
all
do
you
suppose
that
crowd
will
bother
you
again
perhaps
i
better
go
with
you
said
the
apostle
of
muscular
christianity
no
no
i
said
they
not
after
me
especially
i
slip
away
in
the
other
so
i
bade
simpkinson
and
went
out
on
the
steps
and
the
fresh
air
felt
good
to
me
i
saw
the
crowd
down
the
street
the
men
were
still
pushing
and
shouting
driving
people
away
from
the
theatre
i
stopped
for
one
glance
then
hurried
away
and
turned
the
corner
as
i
was
passing
an
office
building
i
saw
a
big
limousine
draw
up
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
stepped
out
a
bold
dark
vivid
beauty
bedecked
with
jewels
and
gorgeous
raiment
of
many
sorts
a
big
black
picture
hat
with
a
flower
garden
and
parts
of
an
aviary
on
top
her
glance
lit
on
me
my
god
will
you
look
who
here
she
came
to
me
with
her
two
hands
stretched
out
billy
wretched
creature
i
have
laid
eyes
on
you
for
two
months
do
you
have
to
desert
me
entirely
just
because
you
fallen
in
love
with
a
society
girl
with
the
face
of
a
japanese
what
the
matter
with
me
that
i
lose
my
lovers
faster
than
i
get
them
i
just
met
edgerton
rosythe
he
got
a
good
excuse
i
admit
i
almost
as
much
scared
of
his
wife
as
he
is
himself
but
still
i
like
a
chance
to
get
tired
of
some
man
first
want
to
come
upstairs
with
me
and
see
what
planchet
doing
to
my
old
grannie
in
her
say
would
you
think
it
would
take
three
days
labor
for
half
a
dozen
sioux
squaws
to
pull
the
skin
off
one
old
lady
back
and
a
week
to
tie
up
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
give
her
a
permanent
smile
grannie
i
said
god
it
would
be
cheaper
to
hire
charlie
chaplin
to
walk
around
in
front
of
you
all
the
rest
of
your
life
but
the
old
girl
was
bound
to
be
beautiful
so
i
said
to
planchet
her
new
from
the
waist
up
madame
for
you
never
can
tell
how
the
fashions
change
and
what
she
need
to
show
and
so
i
knew
that
i
was
back
in
the
real
world
appendix
we
live
in
an
age
the
first
in
human
history
when
religion
is
entirely
excluded
from
politics
and
politics
from
religion
it
may
happen
therefore
that
millions
of
men
will
read
this
story
and
think
it
merely
a
joke
not
realizing
that
it
is
a
literal
translation
of
the
life
of
the
world
greatest
revolutionary
martyr
the
founder
of
the
world
first
proletarian
party
for
the
benefit
of
those
whose
historical
education
has
been
neglected
