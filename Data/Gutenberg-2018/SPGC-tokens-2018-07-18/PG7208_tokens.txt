the

distributed
proofreading
team
kathleen
by
christopher
morley
to
the
real
kathleen
kathleen
i
the
scorpions
were
to
meet
at
eight
and
before
that
hour
kenneth
forbes
had
to
finish
the
first
chapter
of
a
serial
story
the
literary
society
named
in
accordance
with
the
grotesque
whim
of
oxford
undergraduates
consisted
of
eight
members
and
it
was
proposed
that
each
one
should
contribute
a
chapter
forbes
was
of
a
fertile
wit
and
he
had
been
nominated
the
first
operator
he
had
been
allowed
the
whole
christmas
vacation
to
prepare
his
opening
chapter
which
was
why
on
this
first
sunday
of
term
while
the
rest
of
merton
college
was
at
dinner
in
hall
he
sat
at
his
desk
desperately
driving
his
pen
across
the
paper
forbes
room
in
fellows
quad
was
one
of
those
that
had
housed
queen
henrietta
maria
in
and
though
forbes
own
tastes
were
nondescript
the
chamber
still
had
something
of
an
air
the
dark
wood
panelling
might
well
have
done
honour
to
a
royal
lodger
and
a
producer
would
have
coveted
it
as
a
background
for
mary
pickford
it
was
unspoiled
by
pictures
two
or
three
political
maps
of
europe
sketchily
drawn
with
coloured
crayons
were
pinned
up
here
and
there
the
room
was
a
typical
oxford
apartment
dark
a
little
faded
but
redeemed
by
the
grate
of
glowing
coals
behind
the
chimney
two
recessed
seats
looked
out
over
the
college
gardens
long
red
curtains
were
drawn
to
shut
out
the
winter
draughts
it
was
the
true
english
january
driving
squalls
of
rain
dampness
and
devastating
chill
the
east
wind
brought
the
booming
toll
from
magdalen
tower
very
distinctly
to
the
ear
closely
followed
by
the
tinny
chime
in
fellows
quad
it
was
half
past
seven
forbes
laid
down
his
pen
looked
quizzically
at
the
last
illegible
lines
slanting
up
the
paper
and
realized
that
he
was
hungry
his
untasted
tea
and
anchovy
toast
still
stood
in
the
fender
where
the
scout
had
put
them
three
hours
before
he
switched
on
the
electric
light
over
the
dining
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
dropping
on
the
sofa
before
the
fire
prodded
the
huge
lumps
of
soft
coal
into
a
blaze
the
triangular
slices
of
anchovy
toast
were
cold
but
still
very
good
and
he
devoured
them
with
appetite
he
lit
a
cigarette
with
a
sigh
of
content
and
reflected
that
he
had
not
crossed
his
name
off
hall
therefore
he
must
pay
eighteen
pence
for
dinner
even
though
he
had
not
eaten
it
also
there
lay
somewhat
heavily
on
his
mind
the
fact
that
at
ten
the
next
morning
he
must
read
to
his
tutor
an
essay
on
danton
and
robespierre
an
essay
as
yet
unwritten
that
would
mean
a
very
early
rising
and
an
uncomfortable
chilly
session
in
the
college
library
a
dismal
place
in
the
forenoon
never
mind
first
came
a
jolly
evening
with
the
scorpions
the
meetings
were
always
fun
and
this
one
coming
after
the
separation
of
a
vacation
promised
special
sport
carter
was
down
for
a
paper
on
rabelais
king
would
have
some
of
his
amusing
ballades
and
rondeaus
and
above
all
there
would
be
the
first
chapter
of
the
serial
from
which
the
members
promised
themselves
much
diversion
it
was
too
late
now
to
attempt
anything
on
danton
and
robespierre
he
picked
up
a
volume
of
belloc
and
sat
cosily
by
the
fire
a
thumping
tread
sounded
on
the
winding
stairs
then
the
faint
clink
of
a
large
metal
tray
laid
on
the
serving
table
outside
and
a
muffled
knock
at
the
oak
the
thick
outer
door
which
forbes
had
sported
when
he
came
in
at
six
to
write
his
stint
he
unfastened
the
barrier
and
admitted
hinton
the
scout
who
bore
in
a
tray
of
eatables
ordered
by
forbes
from
the
college
for
the
refreshment
of
his
coming
guests
forbes
like
most
men
of
modest
means
made
it
a
point
of
honour
to
entertain
lavishly
when
it
was
his
turn
as
host
and
the
display
set
out
by
hinton
made
an
attractive
still
life
under
the
droplight
a
big
bowl
of
apples
and
oranges
stood
in
the
centre
tin
boxes
from
huntley
and
palmer
a
couple
of
large
iced
cakes
raisins
nuts
and
a
dish
of
candied
fruits
ended
the
solids
there
was
also
a
tray
of
coffee
cups
and
a
huge
silver
coffee
pot
bearing
the
college
arms
flanked
by
a
porcelain
jug
of
hot
milk
de
reszke
cigarettes
whiskey
and
soda
and
a
new
tin
of
john
cotton
smoking
mixture
completed
the
spread
which
would
be
faithfully
reflected
in
forbes
battels
or
weekly
bills
later
on
young
men
at
oxford
do
themselves
well
and
this
was
a
typical
for
an
undergraduate
evening
hinton
a
ruddy
old
man
with
hair
and
a
very
red
and
bulby
nose
was
a
garrulous
servant
and
after
a
tentative
cough
made
an
attempt
at
small
talk
i
did
see
you
in
no
said
forbes
i
had
some
writing
to
do
oh
yes
sir
said
hinton
according
to
the
invariable
formula
of
college
servants
a
moment
later
after
another
embarrassed
cough
he
began
again
very
wet
night
sir
they
say
the
towpath
will
be
under
water
in
another
day
or
forbes
was
not
a
rowing
man
and
the
probable
submerging
of
the
towpath
was
not
news
that
affected
him
one
way
or
the
other
his
only
reply
was
to
ask
the
scout
to
refill
the
for
this
task
hinton
donned
an
old
pair
of
gloves
and
carried
in
several
large
lumps
of
coal
in
his
hands
from
the
bin
outside
then
he
disappeared
into
the
adjoining
bedroom
to
pour
out
a
few
gallons
of
very
cold
water
into
forbes
hip
bath
to
turn
down
the
sheets
lay
out
his
pajamas
and
remove
a
muddy
pair
of
boots
to
be
cleaned
such
are
the
customs
that
make
sweet
the
lives
of
succeeding
undergraduates
at
oxford
it
is
pleasant
to
know
that
palmerston
pitt
gladstone
asquith
they
have
all
gone
through
the
old
routine
forbes
father
had
occupied
the
very
same
rooms
thirty
years
before
and
very
likely
old
hinton
then
a
scout
boy
had
blacked
his
boots
certainly
forbes
senior
had
lain
in
the
same
bedroom
and
watched
magdalen
tower
through
the
trees
while
delaying
to
get
up
on
chilly
mornings
anything
else
sir
said
hinton
as
forbes
put
down
belloc
and
began
to
clean
a
very
crusty
briar
nothing
thank
you
sir
said
hinton
and
took
his
departure
after
poking
up
the
fire
and
removing
the
dead
tea
things
the
eight
chimes
spoke
as
hinton
clumped
downstairs
and
a
few
moments
later
forbes
guests
began
to
straggle
in
all
were
wet
and
ruddy
from
rain
and
wind
and
as
they
discarded
raincoats
and
caps
disclosed
a
pleasant
medley
of
types
the
scorpions
was
a
rather
recent
and
informal
society
but
it
had
gathered
from
various
colleges
a
little
band
of
temperamental
congenials
who
found
a
unique
pleasure
in
their
sunday
evening
meetings
none
of
them
was
of
the
acknowledged
literary
successes
of
the
university
their
names
were
not
those
seen
every
week
in
the
undergraduate
journals
and
yet
this
obscure
group
which
had
drawn
together
in
a
spirit
of
satire
had
in
it
two
or
three
men
of
real
gift
forbes
himself
was
a
man
of
uncommon
vivacity
small
stocky
with
an
unruly
thatch
of
yellow
hair
and
a
quaintly
wry
and
homely
face
he
hid
his
shyness
and
his
brilliancy
behind
a
brusque
manner
ostensibly
cynical
and
a
witty
satirist
of
his
more
sentimental
fellows
his
desk
was
full
of
charming
ballades
and
scratched
off
at
white
heat
in
odd
moments
his
infinite
fund
of
jest
had
won
him
the
nickname
of
priapus
but
beneath
the
uncouth
exterior
of
the
man
behind
his
careless
dress
and
humorously
assumed
coarseness
lay
the
soul
of
a
poet
sensitive
as
a
girl
and
devout
before
the
whisperings
of
beauty
stephen
carter
and
randall
king
were
first
to
arrive
and
seized
the
ends
of
the
fireside
couch
while
forbes
poured
their
coffee
a
clark
russell
of
an
evening
said
carter
stretching
his
golfing
brogues
to
the
blaze
do
you
love
a
good
drenching
downpouring
night
i
do
he
was
a
burly
blond
extravagantly
facetious
in
convivial
moments
and
a
mournful
brooder
in
solitude
king
better
known
as
the
goblin
was
a
dark
whimsical
elf
in
thick
spectacles
much
loved
in
the
dramatic
society
for
his
brilliant
impersonations
the
goblin
said
nothing
as
he
sipped
his
coffee
and
gazed
at
the
fire
there
you
go
again
falstaff
exclaimed
forbes
to
carter
as
he
unlocked
a
corner
cupboard
and
drew
out
a
bottle
of
port
the
universal
enthusiast
i
believe
you
be
enthusiastic
about
the
examiners
that
plough
you
what
falstaff
get
ploughed
said
a
vast
and
rather
handsome
newcomer
flinging
open
the
door
without
knocking
i
think
he
down
for
a
ruddy
first
this
was
douglas
whitney
of
balliol
carter
only
answer
to
both
these
remarks
was
to
drain
a
glass
of
the
port
which
forbes
was
decanting
i
say
priapus
what
vile
port
he
said
is
this
some
of
the
vintage
you
crocked
poor
old
hinton
with
any
port
in
a
storm
falstaff
said
the
goblin
mildly
as
forbes
was
pouring
out
the
coffee
loud
shouts
of
minters
greeted
the
next
arrival
this
was
johnny
blair
of
tennessee
and
trinity
the
only
american
among
the
scorpions
blair
was
a
rhodes
scholar
whose
dulcet
southern
drawl
and
quaint
modes
of
speech
were
a
constant
delight
to
his
english
comrades
his
great
popularity
in
his
own
college
was
begun
by
his
introduction
of
mint
julep
which
had
given
him
his
nickname
hello
minters
cried
forbes
what
cheer
large
tabling
and
belly
cheer
said
blair
quoting
his
favourite
elizabethan
author
by
the
time
forbes
had
poured
out
eight
cups
of
coffee
and
as
many
glasses
of
wine
keith
graham
and
twiston
had
come
in
making
the
full
gathering
there
was
much
laughing
and
banter
as
the
men
stood
round
the
table
or
by
the
fire
lighting
pipes
and
cigarettes
and
helping
themselves
to
fruit
and
cake
finally
when
everyone
was
settled
in
a
semicircle
round
the
fire
forbes
hammered
his
coffee
cup
with
a
spoon
according
to
the
custom
of
the
society
the
host
of
the
evening
always
acted
as
chairman
the
meeting
will
please
come
to
order
said
forbes
brother
scorpions
what
is
your
pleasure
has
the
secretary
anything
to
report
the
gatherings
of
the
scorpions
were
pleasingly
devoid
of
formality
and
untrammeled
by
parliamentary
conventions
there
were
no
minutes
and
the
only
officer
was
a
secretary
who
sent
out
postal
cards
each
week
reminding
the
members
of
the
time
and
place
of
the
next
meeting
king
puffing
happily
at
a
large
pipe
declared
that
no
official
business
required
attention
then
i
call
upon
falstaff
for
his
delightful
paper
on
rabelais
said
forbes
a
small
electric
reading
lamp
was
propped
behind
carter
head
and
the
scorpions
disposed
themselves
to
listen
carter
pulled
an
untidy
manuscript
from
his
pocket
and
after
an
embarrassed
cough
began
to
read
the
general
tenor
of
an
undergraduate
essay
on
rabelais
intended
for
the
intimacy
of
a
fireside
circle
may
readily
be
guessed
the
general
thesis
of
the
composition
was
of
course
to
prove
that
rabelais
was
by
no
means
the
old
dog
of
puritan
conception
or
as
carter
put
it
that
he
was
not
simply
a
george
moore
but
that
his
amazing
writings
bore
witness
throughout
to
a
high
and
devoted
ethical
purpose
it
is
even
conjecturable
that
carter
may
have
said
omnia
but
if
he
did
so
it
was
with
so
droll
an
accent
that
his
audience
laughed
again
at
all
events
his
reading
was
punctuated
with
cheery
applause
and
at
the
conclusion
the
scorpions
renewed
their
acquaintance
with
those
historic
affinities
whiskey
and
soda
discussion
was
brisk
the
meditative
goblin
then
was
called
upon
for
his
poems
and
after
becoming
hesitation
unfolded
a
sheaf
of
verses
his
rhymes
were
always
full
of
quaint
and
elvish
humour
which
was
very
endearing
his
ballade
with
the
refrain
harry
baillie
kept
the
tabard
was
voted
the
best
of
the
six
he
read
but
the
event
of
the
evening
was
to
be
the
serial
story
which
forbes
had
been
appointed
to
begin
a
new
round
of
refreshments
was
distributed
and
then
the
host
took
his
place
under
the
reading
lamp
this
needs
a
word
of
explanation
he
said
having
the
whole
vacation
to
work
on
this
naturally
i
did
nothing
until
tea
time
this
afternoon
i
did
even
have
an
idea
in
my
head
until
yesterday
about
four
yesterday
afternoon
i
was
strolling
down
the
broad
in
desperation
you
know
when
there
is
some
hateful
task
that
has
to
be
done
one
will
snatch
at
any
pretext
for
postponing
it
i
stopped
in
at
blackwell
to
look
for
a
book
i
wanted
up
in
one
corner
of
the
shop
lying
on
a
row
of
books
i
found
impressively
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
double
sheet
of
notepaper
and
held
it
up
it
was
a
letter
evidently
written
by
some
girl
to
a
man
at
the
finding
it
there
forgotten
and
defenseless
i
could
not
resist
reading
it
it
was
a
very
charming
letter
not
too
intimate
but
full
of
a
delicious
virgin
coyness
and
reserve
then
a
great
idea
struck
me
why
not
take
the
people
mentioned
in
the
letter
and
use
them
as
the
characters
of
our
story
we
know
that
they
are
real
people
we
know
their
first
names
that
all
we
know
about
them
the
rest
can
be
left
to
the
invention
of
the
generous
laughter
greeted
the
idea
let
hear
the
letter
cried
someone
yes
said
forbes
before
reading
my
chapter
i
read
you
the
letter
and
then
remember
that
our
story
is
to
be
built
up
solely
upon
this
document
there
are
to
be
no
characters
in
the
story
except
those
mentioned
in
the
letter
and
our
task
must
be
to
delineate
them
in
such
a
way
that
they
are
in
keeping
with
the
suggestions
the
letter
gives
us
here

the
cause

your
starvation

way

i
do
like
it
not
that
that
will
trouble

idea

all
bad
but

bit
of
news
and
i
have
just
found

many
thanks

remain

kathleen
excuse
this
scrawl
but
the
pen
groggy
a
moment
of
silence
followed
the
reading
of
the
letter
joe
a
lucky
boy
said
whitney
she
a
the
letter
does
tell
us
much
said
forbes
as
he
handed
it
round
for
examination
but
more
than
you
might
think
before
writing
my
chapter
i
summarized
the
data
here
they
are
he
a
member
of
the
who
writes
poetry
either
published
in
some
magazine
or
he
sends
it
privately
to
her
the
blighter
has
sent
kathleen
a
tie
of
some
kind
probably
a
scarf
with
his
college
or
club
colours
he
got
as
far
as
the
plaintive
stage
he
tells
her
that
he
is
going
without
his
tea
just
to
write
to
her
probably
half
a
dozen
crumpets
and
four
cups
of
tea
were
simmering
inside
of
him
as
he
wrote
so
much
for
joe
i
wager
he
a
rhodes
scholar
i
put
her
at
seventeen
and
as
whitney
says
she
a
darling
she
at
school
still
she
adorably
sane
she
does
care
for
joe
yowling
poetry
probably
he
writes
verlaine
kind
of
stuff
or
free
verse
or
some
blither
of
that
sort
she
has
younger
brothers
boys
and
she
helps
her
mother
run
the
house
i
think
she
likes
joe
better
than
she
cares
to
admit
see
the
touch
of
coquettishness
where
she
says
be
precious
wo
it
and
how
adorably
she
teases
him
in
those
four
crosses
marked
are
from
fred
gad
jealous
of
joe
already
i
think
he
the
older
brother
probably
recently
left
the
a
friend
of
joe
perhaps
is
one
of
the
younger
brothers
he
goes
to
some
kind
of
night
school
or
gymnasium
probably
an
ugly
little
beggar
why
he
get
his
food
for
himself
do
know
anything
about
her
except
that
she
went
to
birmingham
with
kathleen
has
one
thing
you
do
mention
said
graham
it
an
easy
run
from
here
to
wolverhampton
on
a
motor
bike
rather
a
sell
if
joe
should
turn
out
a
boxing
blue
and
mash
us
all
into
pulp
for
bagging
his
letter
said
whitney
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
this
whitney
was
over
six
feet
rowed
number
in
the
balliol
boat
and
was
nicknamed
the
iron
duke
for
his
muscular
strength
go
on
with
your
chapter
priapus
said
the
goblin
ii
when
forbes
had
finished
there
was
general
laughter
and
applause
the
whimsical
idea
of
building
a
tale
around
the
persons
of
the
letter
was
one
which
his
playful
mind
was
competent
to
develop
and
he
had
written
a
deft
and
amusing
introduction
taking
joe
as
his
subject
he
had
sketched
that
gentleman
character
with
a
touch
of
irony
he
had
made
him
a
rhodes
scholar
from
indiana
evoking
protest
from
minters
and
had
carried
him
on
a
vacation
to
guilford
house
a
small
hotel
in
london
much
frequented
by
rhodes
scholars
there
he
had
made
him
meet
kathleen
who
with
her
mother
was
staying
in
london
for
a
few
days
forbes
had
a
taste
for
brunettes
and
in
his
description
of
the
imagined
kathleen
he
had
indulged
himself
heartily
he
found
her
to
be
seventeen
slender
with
that
strong
slimness
that
only
an
english
girl
achieves
with
a
straight
brown
gaze
and
abundant
dark
chestnut
hair
she
was
captain
of
her
school
hockey
team
it
seemed
she
was
good
at
tennis
and
swimming
and
geometry
she
had
small
patience
with
poetry
and
sentiment
but
within
the
athletic
and
straightforward
flapper
forbes
thought
he
saw
the
fluttering
of
deeper
womanhood
the
maiden
soul
erecting
a
barrier
of
abrupt
common
sense
about
itself
to
conceal
the
shy
and
sensitive
feelings
that
were
beginning
to
blossom
such
at
any
rate
was
kenneth
forbes
and
he
developed
his
chapter
toward
a
climax
where
kathleen
and
joe
were
left
walking
in
park
and
the
next
author
would
find
some
difficulty
in
knowing
how
to
proceed
with
the
second
instalment
well
done
indeed
cried
blair
as
forbes
laid
down
his
manuscript
and
reached
for
his
pipe
there
was
a
general
murmur
of
assent
as
the
men
got
up
to
stretch
and
talk
someone
punched
the
coals
into
flame
and
the
bowl
of
fruit
was
passed
round
who
to
write
the
next
chapter
asked
graham
let
falstaff
do
it
cried
blair
he
the
sentimentalist
but
go
easy
on
poor
joe
you
know
all
rhodes
scholars
do
come
from
indiana
have
a
heart
do
whatever
you
like
to
joe
cried
forbes
but
be
careful
with
kathleen
she
adorable
i
going
to
write
a
ballade
to
her
and
mail
it
to
her
i
wish
there
was
some
way
of
getting
hold
of
her
picture
said
keith
her
picture
said
graham
nonsense
why
not
see
the
flapper
herself
i
going
to
bike
over
there
on
my
rudge
erb
round
till
i
find
the
street
and
then
skid
like
hell
right
on
to
her
doorstep
i
shall
lie
there
in
mute
agony
until
i
carried
i
say
now
that
no
fair
cried
forbes
i
discovered
her
just
because
you
got
a
motor
bike
you
must
take
an
advantage
look
here
said
the
goblin
mildly
speaking
from
a
blue
cloud
of
murray
mixture
we
must
all
sign
a
protocol
or
a
mandamus
or
a
lagniappe
or
whatever
you
law
men
call
it
not
to
steal
a
march
i
think
we
all
like
to
meet
the
real
kathleen
but
we
must
give
a
bond
to
start
fair
and
square
and
nobody
do
anything
that
is
authorized
by
the
whole
cried
several
voices
all
right
then
said
the
goblin
fill
glasses
everyone
and
solemnize
the
oath
brother
scorpions
i
do
you
to
wit
that
we
all
jointly
and
severally
promise
not
to
take
any
steps
toward
making
the
acquaintance
of
said
kathleen
until
so
authorized
by
the
whole
society
so
help
me
god
they
all
drank
to
this
with
some
chuckles
what
a
lark
if
we
could
get
kathleen
down
for
eights
week
said
someone
very
likely
joe
will
have
her
here
said
whitney
you
seem
to
forget
that
he
been
rowing
this
course
for
some
they
all
scowled
i
wonder
how
many
members
of
the
are
called
joe
keith
asked
about
three
hundred
i
dare
say
said
falstaff
i
tell
you
what
we
might
do
said
forbes
when
the
yarn
finished
we
can
send
it
to
her
explain
just
how
the
whole
thing
happened
and
ask
permission
to
call
she
got
a
sense
of
humour
i
swear
balmy
retorted
falstaff
she
probably
be
frightfully
fed
because
you
bagged
her
letter
a
hell
of
a
thing
to
do
crib
a
letter
it
a
hell
of
a
thing
to
do
to
leave
it
lying
around
cried
forbes
impenitent
no
quarter
for
joebags
let
the
punishment
fit
the
well
you
chaps
i
got
to
sheer
off
said
whitney
it
nearly
eleven
and
i
got
an
essay
on
the
stocks
priapus
i
had
a
ripping
a
mo
cried
forbes
who
to
do
the
next
chapter
and
where
do
we
meet
next
week
falstaff
cried
several
voices
why
not
do
two
chapters
a
week
said
carter
i
do
one
and
goblin
can
do
another
let
meet
in
my
this
was
agreed
to
and
after
much
scuffling
with
greatcoats
and
scarves
the
guests
tramped
off
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
rainy
quad
forbes
could
hear
them
a
minute
later
thundering
with
their
heels
on
the
huge
college
gate
as
they
waited
for
the
porter
to
let
them
out
the
room
was
foul
with
smoke
and
he
opened
a
window
over
the
gardens
letting
in
a
gush
of
chill
sweet
air
and
rain
through
the
darkness
he
could
hear
many
chimes
counting
eleven
he
looked
wearily
at
the
scribbled
notes
for
his
essay
on
danton
and
robespierre
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
to
bed
iii
by
the
time
that
carter
and
king
had
written
their
chapters
and
read
them
aloud
the
scorpions
were
all
frankly
adorers
of
kathleen
by
midterm
she
had
become
an
obsession
eric
twiston
and
bob
graham
doing
a
cornstalk
as
walking
on
cornmarket
street
is
elegantly
termed
were
wont
to
dub
any
really
delightful
girl
they
saw
as
a
kathleen
sort
of
at
the
annual
dinner
of
the
club
which
took
place
in
a
private
dining
room
at
the
clarry
the
clarendon
hotel
in
february
forbes
was
called
upon
to
respond
to
the
toast
the
real
his
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
and
absinthe
frappe
nearly
failed
him
but
he
managed
to
stammer
a
few
phrases
which
thought
at
the
time
to
be
extemporaneous
called
forth
loud
applause
but
it
was
found
later
that
he
had
jotted
them
down
on
the
tablecloth
during
the
soup
and
fish
courses
fellow
scorpers
he
said
i
mean
you
chaps
look
here
not
much
at
this
business
but
hem
i
want
to
say
that
i
regard
kathleen
with
feelings
of
iridescent
emotion
i
feel
sure
that
she
is
a
pronounced
brunette
and
that
the
blue
flapper
we
all
used
to
see
at
the
east
ocker
is
nowhere
i
been
playing
lackers
lacrosse
this
term
and
i
give
you
my
word
that
when
i
been
bloody
well
done
in
and
had
an
absolute
needle
of
funk
i
had
only
to
think
of
kathleen
to
buck
me
up
hem
now
gentlemen
you
may
think
i
drunk
loud
cries
of
but
i
want
to
say
in
truth
and
soberness
that
any
man
who
thinks
he
got
kathleen
for
bondwoman
hem
has
me
to
reckon
with
the
applause
at
this
speech
was
so
immoderate
that
a
party
of
boston
ladies
dining
with
a
chautauqua
lecturer
in
the
clarendon
main
dining
room
shuddered
and
began
looking
up
to
stratford
by
this
time
the
serial
story
had
grown
to
the
length
of
seven
or
eight
chapters
and
the
scorpions
became
so
engrossed
in
the
fortunes
of
the
kenyons
so
for
convenience
they
had
dubbed
kathleen
family
that
at
the
dinner
a
separate
health
was
drunk
to
each
character
in
the
story
and
one
of
the
members
was
called
upon
to
reply
falstaff
carter
responded
to
the
toast
to
joe
and
recounted
his
secret
investigations
into
the
number
of
members
of
the
university
who
bore
that
name
he
claimed
to
have
tabulated
from
the
university
almanac
men
so
christened
and
offered
to
go
into
the
life
history
of
any
or
all
of
them
he
said
that
he
was
happy
to
say
that
the
only
joseph
who
seemed
at
all
likely
to
be
a
poet
was
a
scrubby
little
man
at
teddy
hall
who
wore
spectacles
and
a
ragged
exhibitioner
gown
and
did
not
seem
to
threaten
a
serious
rivalry
to
any
scorpion
bent
on
supplanting
him
i
also
find
he
added
that
the
master
of
the
new
college
and
magdalen
beagles
is
called
joe
he
is
a
member
of
the
bullingdon
and
if
he
is
the
cheese
it
distinctly
mooters
whether
any
of
the
scorpers
have
a
ghostly
show
but
i
vote
gentlemen
that
we
do
crock
at
this
stage
of
the
it
was
decided
at
the
dinner
that
during
the
ensuing
easter
vacation
the
scorpions
should
make
a
trip
to
wolverhampton
en
masse
for
the
purpose
of
picketing
bancroft
road
and
finding
out
what
kathleen
was
really
like
and
then
after
singing
langers
and
godders
auld
lang
syne
and
god
save
the
king
the
meeting
broke
up
and
the
members
dispersed
darkly
in
various
directions
to
avoid
the
proctors
iv
friday
the
fifteenth
of
march
was
the
last
day
of
term
the
scorpions
busy
in
their
various
ways
with
the
hundred
details
that
have
to
be
attended
to
before
going
down
were
all
pleasantly
excited
by
the
anticipation
of
their
quest
which
was
to
begin
on
the
morrow
carter
shaking
hands
with
the
warden
of
new
college
in
the
college
hall
a
pleasant
little
formality
performed
at
the
end
of
each
term
replied
wolverhampton
when
the
warden
asked
him
where
he
was
going
to
spend
the
vacation
he
was
then
hard
put
to
it
to
avoid
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
vicar
of
philip
in
that
city
an
old
pupil
of
the
warden
king
bicycling
rapidly
down
the
greasy
turl
with
an
armful
of
books
collided
vigorously
with
another
cyclist
at
the
corner
of
the
high
they
both
sprawled
on
the
curb
bikes
interlocked
my
god
sir
cried
the
goblin
why
not
watch
where
you
going
then
he
saw
it
was
johnny
blair
sorry
goblin
said
the
latter
i
i
was
thinking
about
so
was
i
said
king
picking
up
his
books
and
in
defiance
of
the
university
statute
of
still
unrepealed
which
warns
students
against
frequenting
dicing
houses
taverns
or
booths
where
the
nicotian
herb
is
sold
they
went
into
hedderly
together
to
buy
tobacco
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
they
were
all
in
cabs
on
their
way
to
the
great
western
station
it
was
a
mild
and
sunny
day
with
puffs
of
spring
in
the
air
who
can
ever
forget
the
saturday
morning
at
the
end
of
term
when
the
men
go
down
long
lines
of
hansoms
spinning
briskly
toward
the
station
with
bulging
portmanteaus
on
the
roof
the
wide
sunny
sweep
of
the
broad
with
the
trundling
past
trinity
gates
a
knot
of
tall
youths
in
the
uniform
of
gray
bags
and
brown
tweed
norfolk
smoking
and
talking
at
the
balliol
lodge
and
over
it
all
the
clang
of
a
hundred
chimes
the
gray
fingers
of
a
thousand
spires
and
pinnacles
the
moist
blue
sky
of
england
ah
it
is
the
palace
of
youth
or
it
was
once
the
scorpions
met
on
the
dingy
platform
graham
keith
and
twiston
had
been
obliged
to
scratch
owing
to
other
more
imperative
plans
but
five
members
boarded
the
train
in
high
spirits
forbes
carter
king
blair
and
whitney
they
filled
a
smoker
with
tobacco
and
jest
now
goblin
cried
falstaff
as
the
train
ran
past
the
port
meadow
and
the
radcliffe
dome
dropped
from
view
open
those
sealed
orders
you
promised
to
draw
up
the
rules
of
the
king
pulled
a
paper
from
his
pocket
i
jotted
down
some
points
he
said
this
is
the
time
to
discuss
rules
to
be
observed
by
the
scorpions
on
the
great
kathleen
the
headquarters
of
the
expedition
will
be
the
blue
boar
inn
at
wolverhampton
i
written
to
them
to
engage
rooms
the
kriegspiel
will
begin
at
and
manoeuvres
will
continue
without
intermission
until
someone
is
declared
the
winner
or
until
time
is
called
the
object
of
the
contest
is
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
kathleen
to
engage
her
in
friendly
conversation
to
win
her
confidence
and
to
induce
her
to
accept
an
invitation
to
commem
or
eights
week
any
deception
strategy
or
tactics
which
are
not
calculated
to
give
intolerable
distress
or
embarrassment
to
kathleen
and
her
family
are
allowable
if
by
noon
on
tuesday
no
one
shall
have
succeeded
in
making
friends
with
kathleen
the
game
shall
be
declared
suppose
she
not
at
home
said
whitney
we
have
to
chance
what
time
do
we
get
there
i
ordered
lunch
at
the
blue
boar
at
one
this
train
gets
to
wolvers
at
it
was
a
merry
ride
the
story
of
kathleen
as
they
had
written
it
was
discussed
pro
and
con
the
usual
protests
were
launched
at
carter
for
having
in
his
chapter
lowered
the
theme
to
the
level
of
burlesque
praise
was
accorded
to
the
goblin
for
the
dexterity
with
which
he
had
rescued
the
plot
blair
chapter
had
been
full
of
american
slang
which
had
to
be
explained
to
the
others
joe
the
rhodes
scholar
hero
had
shown
a
vein
of
fine
gold
under
blair
hands
he
bade
fair
to
win
the
charming
kathleen
although
the
story
had
not
been
finished
owing
to
the
examinations
which
had
fallen
upon
the
brotherhood
toward
the
end
of
term
the
game
begun
in
pure
jest
had
taken
on
something
of
romantic
earnest
there
was
not
one
of
these
young
men
who
did
not
see
in
kathleen
his
own
ideal
of
slender
girlhood
and
when
the
train
pulled
into
wolverhampton
they
tumbled
out
of
their
smoking
carriage
with
keen
expectation
v
perhaps
the
best
way
to
pursue
the
next
episodes
in
the
quest
is
in
the
words
of
johnny
blair
the
rhodes
scholar
who
jotted
down
some
notes
in
a
journal
he
kept
we
got
to
wolverhampton
ingersoll
time
had
a
jolly
trip
on
the
train
all
the
scorps
laying
bets
as
to
who
would
be
first
to
meet
kathleen
i
lay
low
but
did
some
planning
did
want
to
let
these
english
blighters
get
ahead
of
me
especially
after
all
the
ragging
indiana
joe
got
in
the
story
train
stopped
at
birmingham
at
noon
my
tobacco
pouch
had
run
empty
and
i
hopped
out
to
buy
some
murray
at
the
newsstand
saw
the
prettiest
flapper
of
my
life
on
the
platform
the
real
english
type
tweed
suit
dark
hair
gray
eyes
and
cheeks
like
almond
blossoms
she
had
on
a
blue
shanter
loveliest
figure
i
ever
saw
perfect
ankle
but
the
usual
heavy
brogues
on
her
feet
why
do
english
girls
always
wear
woollen
stockings
was
so
taken
with
her
i
almost
missed
the
train
she
got
into
a
compartment
farther
up
the
train
the
others
were
all
bickering
in
the
smoking
carriage
so
they
did
see
her
i
scored
over
the
rest
of
the
crowd
when
we
got
to
wolvers
they
had
all
brought
heavy
portmanteaus
containing
all
their
vacation
baggage
my
idea
was
go
light
when
chasing
the
grail
had
only
my
rucksack
left
rest
of
my
stuff
at
to
be
forwarded
later
while
the
other
chaps
were
getting
their
stuff
out
of
the
goods
van
i
spotted
miss
flapper
getting
off
the
train
she
got
into
a
hansom
just
by
dumb
luck
i
was
standing
near
i
heard
her
say
to
cabby
bancroft
road
lord
was
i
tickled
i
kept
mum
most
of
the
fellows
took
cabs
on
account
of
their
luggage
but
goblin
and
i
hoofed
it
wolverhampton
seems
a
dingy
place
for
kathleen
to
live
fine
old
church
though
and
lovely
market
place
we
kept
our
eyes
open
for
bancroft
road
but
saw
no
sign
when
we
got
to
the
blue
boar
lunch
was
all
ready
for
us
in
the
coffee
room
landlord
tickled
to
death
at
our
arrival
wonderful
cheddar
cheese
and
archdeacon
ale
we
made
quite
a
ceremony
of
it
all
drank
kathleen
health
and
on
the
stroke
of
two
we
got
up
from
the
table
all
the
others
beat
it
off
immediately
in
different
directions
looking
for
bancroft
road
i
expect
i
had
an
idea
that
more
finesse
would
be
needed
i
started
off
with
the
others
then
pretended
i
had
left
my
pipe
and
came
back
to
the
boar
i
was
going
to
look
up
the
town
directory
to
find
kathleen
name
knowing
the
address
that
would
be
easy
but
there
was
goblin
doing
the
same
thing
we
both
laughed
and
looked
it
up
together
the
name
at
bancroft
road
was
kent
philip
kent
fellow
of
the
society
of
antiquaries
i
suppose
the
book
put
him
down
as
an
kathleen
father
evidently
goblin
disappeared
in
that
noiseless
way
of
his
and
i
lit
a
pipe
and
pondered
the
fellows
had
been
full
of
wild
suggestions
as
to
what
they
would
do
when
they
got
to
bancroft
road
one
was
going
to
be
a
book
agent
and
get
into
the
house
that
way
another
said
he
would
be
the
man
and
make
friends
with
the
cook
someone
else
suggested
dressing
up
as
a
plumber
or
and
going
there
to
fix
some
imaginary
leak
knowing
that
the
kents
were
not
fools
i
imagined
it
would
be
long
before
they
get
wise
to
the
fact
that
that
bunch
of
dreadnoughts
was
picketing
the
house
probably
they
put
the
police
on
them
also
there
nobody
harder
to
disguise
than
an
english
man
he
gives
himself
away
at
every
turn
if
fred
was
around
he
be
sure
to
smell
a
rat
one
of
those
chaps
would
be
likely
to
fake
himself
up
as
a
plumber
and
get
in
the
house
on
some
pretext
or
other
still
wearing
his
i
thought
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
to
stay
away
from
bancroft
road
for
a
while
and
try
to
pull
wires
from
a
distance
the
blue
boar
inn
a
very
nice
old
house
by
the
way
looks
out
over
the
old
wolverhampton
market
place
in
one
corner
of
the
square
i
had
noticed
a
little
post
office
you
can
send
a
telegram
from
any
post
office
in
england
and
i
thought
that
would
be
my
best
entering
wedge
the
word
antiquarian
in
the
directory
had
given
me
a
notion
on
a
blank
i
composed
the
following
message
after
some
revisions
miss
kathleen
kent
bancroft
road
wolverhampton
my
friend
john
blair
of
trinity
now
in
wolverhampton
for
historical
study
staying
at
blue
boar
nice
chap
american
may
he
call
on
you
if
so
send
him
a
line
sorry
ca
write
hurt
hand
playing
soccer
love
to
all
joe
this
was
taking
a
long
chance
but
was
the
best
move
i
could
think
of
i
asked
the
lady
behind
the
counter
to
mark
the
telegram
as
though
it
came
from
oxford
she
said
she
could
not
do
so
but
i
happened
to
have
a
piece
in
my
pocket
and
that
persuaded
her
i
convinced
her
that
it
was
a
harmless
joke
i
did
see
that
there
was
anything
further
to
be
done
immediately
if
the
telegram
brought
no
word
i
should
have
to
think
up
something
else
in
the
meantime
if
i
was
to
pose
as
an
antiquarian
investigator
i
had
better
get
up
some
dope
on
the
history
of
wolverhampton
i
poked
about
until
i
found
a
bookshop
where
i
bought
a
little
pamphlet
about
the
town
and
studied
a
map
bancroft
road
was
out
toward
the
northern
suburbs
a
little
talk
with
the
bookseller
brought
me
the
information
that
kent
was
one
of
his
best
customers
a
pleasant
and
gentleman
of
sixty
whose
only
hobby
was
the
history
of
the
region
he
had
written
a
book
called
memorials
of
old
staffordshire
but
unfortunately
i
could
get
a
copy
the
bookseller
said
it
was
out
of
print
then
i
went
to
have
a
look
at
philip
church
a
fine
old
norman
pile
with
some
lovely
brasses
and
crusaders
tombs
here
i
had
a
piece
of
luck
fell
in
with
the
vicar
one
of
the
jolly
old
and
sort
an
old
oxford
man
as
it
happened
i
pumped
him
a
little
about
the
history
of
the
church
and
in
his
delight
at
finding
an
american
who
cared
for
such
matters
he
talked
freely
why
he
kept
on
saying
with
a
kind
of
pathetic
enthusiasm
i
thought
all
you
americans
were
interested
in
was
standard
oil
and
tinned
finally
he
invited
me
over
to
the
vicarage
for
tea
as
i
sat
by
his
fire
and
ate
toasted
muffins
i
could
help
chuckling
to
think
how
different
this
was
from
the
other
scorpions
plan
of
attack
they
were
probably
all
biting
their
nails
up
and
down
bancroft
road
trying
to
carry
the
fort
by
direct
assault
it
amazing
how
things
turn
out
just
as
i
was
wondering
how
to
give
the
conversation
a
twist
in
the
right
direction
the
vicar
said
if
you
really
interested
in
the
history
of
this
region
you
should
certainly
have
a
talk
with
old
kent
he
our
leading
antiquarian
and
knows
more
about
the
stour
valley
than
any
one
else
he
says
there
was
a
skirmish
fought
here
in
that
all
the
books
have
overlooked
the
battle
of
wolverhampton
he
calls
it
he
wrote
a
little
pamphlet
about
it
i
assured
the
good
parson
that
my
eagerness
to
know
more
about
the
battle
of
wolverhampton
was
unbounded
i
nearly
spilled
my
tea
in
my
excitement
is
that
kent
of
bancroft
road
i
asked
yes
answered
the
vicar
how
did
you
know
they
told
me
about
him
at
the
i
explained
that
i
was
in
wolverhampton
for
a
day
or
so
only
and
finally
the
excellent
man
came
across
with
the
suggestion
i
was
panting
for
well
he
said
as
it
happens
i
have
one
or
two
calls
to
make
in
that
direction
this
evening
if
you
care
to
have
me
do
so
i
speak
to
kent
about
you
and
he
can
make
an
appointment
you
said
you
were
stopping
at
the
blue
boar
i
thanked
him
with
such
warmth
that
his
eyes
twinkled
my
dear
fellow
he
said
your
enthusiasm
does
you
great
credit
i
wish
you
all
success
in
your
i
got
back
to
the
boar
feeling
that
i
had
done
a
very
good
work
indeed
vi
the
scorpions
continues
blair
diary
were
all
very
merry
at
dinner
that
night
particularly
at
my
expense
i
was
the
only
one
who
had
not
been
out
to
bancroft
road
to
look
over
the
ground
apparently
they
had
had
a
very
cheery
time
well
falstaff
what
luck
i
asked
carter
splendid
he
replied
the
local
butcher
has
given
me
a
job
and
going
to
call
there
for
a
meat
order
tomorrow
what
shouted
someone
on
sunday
not
likely
i
knew
mighty
well
that
carter
would
not
concoct
anything
as
crude
as
that
and
wondered
what
deviltry
he
had
devised
i
noticed
that
two
telegrams
were
delivered
at
the
house
this
afternoon
said
forbes
in
a
quiet
kind
of
way
perhaps
joe
is
on
his
way
here
said
i
if
so
as
i
spoke
i
wondered
rather
anxiously
what
the
telegram
could
be
well
we
saw
her
anyway
said
whitney
and
she
marvellous
she
wears
a
blue
shanter
and
has
an
ankle
like
a
fairy
tale
we
saw
her
walk
down
the
that
nothing
i
retorted
i
saw
her
hours
ago
she
was
on
the
train
with
us
from
birmingham
this
this
started
a
furious
wrangle
they
said
i
had
played
fair
as
the
contest
did
begin
until
two
my
point
was
that
i
had
not
transgressed
the
rules
as
i
had
done
nothing
to
profit
by
my
accident
in
seeing
her
first
i
could
help
seeing
her
could
i
i
asked
you
could
have
too
if
you
had
been
all
frowsting
over
in
the
train
and
after
all
i
did
it
was
kathleen
i
only
suspected
i
changed
the
conversation
by
asking
where
the
goblin
was
no
one
had
noticed
before
that
he
had
turned
up
this
was
a
bit
disconcerting
i
secretly
thought
him
the
most
dangerous
competitor
he
has
a
quiet
impish
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
an
unobtrusive
way
of
getting
what
he
wants
however
the
others
scoffed
at
my
fears
although
they
all
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
amusing
time
they
had
had
i
could
not
gather
that
they
had
really
accomplished
much
forbes
claimed
to
have
seen
fred
and
said
he
looked
like
a
rotter
we
drank
kathleen
health
a
couple
of
times
and
then
the
other
three
sat
down
to
dummy
bridge
i
slipped
away
to
the
public
library
partly
to
get
some
more
of
my
antiquarian
information
about
wolverhampton
and
partly
because
i
knew
my
absence
would
disquiet
them
i
found
the
library
after
some
difficulty
in
the
large
i
hunted
up
some
books
of
reference
but
to
my
disappointment
volume
was
out
looking
round
for
a
place
to
sit
the
first
person
i
saw
was
the
goblin
bent
very
busily
over
a
book
and
making
notes
on
a
pad
of
paper
i
leaned
over
him
hello
goblin
i
whispered
getting
ready
for
a
first
he
started
and
tried
to
cover
his
volume
with
a
newspaper
but
i
had
seen
it
it
was
a
cook
book
that
a
queer
kind
of
fiction
you
mulling
over
i
remarked
i
looking
up
a
recipe
for
stuffed
eggs
said
the
goblin
without
a
quiver
our
common
room
steward
does
them
so
well
do
let
me
interrupt
you
i
said
i
sat
down
in
a
corner
of
the
room
with
a
volume
of
the
britannica
when
i
next
looked
up
the
goblin
was
gone
as
usual
i
wasted
my
time
with
the
encyclopedia
i
got
interested
in
the
articles
on
wages
warts
weather
wordsworth
and
worms
by
the
time
i
got
to
wolverhampton
it
was
closing
time
i
did
just
seize
the
information
that
the
town
was
founded
in
by
wulfruna
widow
of
the
earl
of
northampton
then
i
had
to
leave
i
got
back
to
the
boar
about
the
was
empty
the
landlord
said
that
whitney
and
forbes
were
out
but
that
carter
had
gone
upstairs
falstaff
and
i
were
rooming
together
and
when
i
went
up
i
found
him
reading
in
bed
hello
wulfruna
he
said
as
i
came
in
evidently
he
too
had
been
reading
up
some
history
just
as
i
got
into
bed
he
fell
asleep
and
his
book
dropped
to
the
floor
with
a
thump
i
crept
quietly
across
the
room
and
picked
it
up
it
was
memorials
of
old
staffordshire
by
philip
kent
the
very
copy
that
i
had
looked
for
at
the
library
i
skimmed
over
it
and
then
put
it
carefully
back
by
falstaff
bedside
was
he
on
the
antiquarian
trail
too
i
began
to
realize
that
these
rivals
of
mine
would
take
some
beating
the
next
morning
sunday
i
found
a
note
waiting
for
me
on
the
breakfast
table
three
indignant
scorpions
were
weighing
it
studying
the
handwriting
and
examining
the
stationery
like
three
detectives
it
not
kathleen
hand
but
i
swear
it
the
same
notepaper
forbes
was
saying
under
a
venomous
gaze
from
all
three
i
took
the
letter
out
of
the
room
before
opening
it
forbes
was
right
it
was
the
bancroft
road
notepaper
it
ran
thus
bancroft
road
wolverhampton
saturday
evening
dear
blair
dunton
the
vicar
of
philip
has
just
told
me
of
your
visit
to
him
i
am
so
glad
to
know
that
you
take
an
antiquarian
interest
in
this
region
curiously
enough
only
this
afternoon
we
had
two
wires
from
our
cousin
joe
in
oxford
one
of
which
mentioned
your
being
here
that
gives
us
additional
reason
for
looking
forward
to
making
your
acquaintance
kent
wants
you
to
come
to
lunch
with
us
at
one
unfortunately
i
myself
am
laid
up
with
rheumatism
but
some
of
the
family
will
be
delighted
to
take
you
to
see
the
quite
surprising
relics
in
this
vicinity
joe
has
probably
told
you
all
about
fred
who
is
really
quite
one
of
the
family
the
poor
fellow
needs
exercise
dreadfully
you
must
take
him
with
you
if
you
go
tramping
charlie
and
oliver
my
boys
are
away
at
school
do
attempt
to
reply
to
this
but
just
turn
up
at
one
sincerely
yours
philip
kent
this
gave
me
several
reasons
for
thought
and
disregarding
the
appeals
from
the
to
come
in
and
tell
them
all
about
it
i
walked
into
the
courtyard
of
the
inn
to
consider
first
what
was
the
wire
from
joe
heavens
was
he
on
his
way
from
oxford
to
wolverhampton
if
my
fake
telegram
were
discovered
too
soon
i
should
be
in
a
very
embarrassing
position
second
joe
was
a
cousin
was
he
one
of
those
annoying
second
cousins
probably
who
are
close
enough
to
the
family
to
be
a
familiar
figure
and
yet
far
enough
away
in
blood
to
marry
the
daughter
and
then
there
was
this
sinister
person
fred
who
was
really
quite
one
of
the
another
cousin
perhaps
what
was
the
matter
with
the
devil
anyway
if
he
needed
exercise
why
did
he
go
and
get
it
certainly
i
did
want
to
spend
an
afternoon
antiquarianizing
with
him
how
was
i
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
so
that
i
could
get
a
with
i
could
see
that
if
this
game
was
to
be
played
through
successfully
it
must
be
played
with
some
daring
de
i
thought
and
let
breakfast
go
hang
moreover
my
sudden
disappearance
would
help
to
demoralize
my
rivals
i
stuck
my
head
into
the
where
priapus
was
just
dishing
out
the
bacon
and
eggs
in
that
instant
it
struck
me
again
that
the
goblin
was
not
there
i
cried
ye
gods
in
a
loud
voice
and
slammed
the
door
behind
me
as
i
ran
out
of
the
front
door
i
laughed
at
the
picture
of
their
disconcerted
faces
my
idea
was
to
lure
fred
away
from
bancroft
road
at
all
hazards
this
could
only
be
done
by
another
telegram
and
as
it
was
sunday
the
railway
station
was
the
only
place
to
send
one
from
it
was
a
beautiful
clear
morning
and
i
hurried
through
the
streets
with
exultation
but
also
with
a
good
deal
of
nervousness
as
to
the
outcome
of
this
shameless
hoaxing
at
any
rate
i
thought
i
may
as
well
live
up
to
my
privileges
as
an
irresponsible
american
the
great
kathleen
excursion
was
beginning
to
take
on
in
my
mind
the
character
of
an
international
joust
or
tourney
at
the
station
or
at
the
depot
as
one
would
say
at
home
i
sent
the
following
message
frederick
kent
bancroft
road
wolverhampton
unavoidably
detained
oxford
hurt
leg
playing
soccer
wish
you
could
join
me
at
once
urgent
joe
i
got
back
to
the
boar
in
time
for
a
cold
breakfast
none
of
the
others
was
there
i
ate
with
my
antiquarian
notes
on
wolverhampton
propped
against
the
coffee
pot
i
was
determined
that
kent
should
find
me
as
intelligent
as
possible
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
before
lunch
time
i
read
kent
letter
over
several
times
and
i
must
confess
that
the
mention
of
that
other
wire
from
joe
worried
me
a
good
deal
just
how
far
the
telegram
i
had
just
sent
might
conflict
with
the
facts
as
known
to
the
kents
i
could
not
surmise
i
could
only
trust
to
luck
and
pray
for
the
best
i
learned
from
the
chambermaid
that
the
goblin
had
come
in
very
late
the
night
before
and
had
gone
out
at
six
that
bothered
me
almost
more
than
anything
else
finally
after
hanging
round
the
empty
for
a
while
i
got
nervous
and
determined
to
go
to
morning
service
at
philip
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
to
get
out
to
bancroft
road
afterward
and
perhaps
kathleen
would
be
at
church
and
i
could
get
a
distant
view
of
her
i
walked
round
to
the
church
service
had
begun
but
i
went
in
and
sat
down
at
the
back
during
a
hymn
i
took
a
good
look
round
to
my
horror
i
saw
in
a
pew
a
few
feet
in
front
of
me
a
young
person
whose
robust
outline
seemed
familiar
i
looked
again
it
was
falstaff
carter
in
the
of
a
curate
trembling
with
indignation
i
crept
out
of
the
church
i
hardly
dared
speculate
on
what
low
device
he
had
planned
for
winning
his
way
into
the
sanctum
at
any
rate
i
thought
i
am
fixed
for
lunch
once
i
get
there
i
guess
i
can
gain
ground
as
fast
as
any
i
ran
over
my
antiquarian
data
another
time
it
was
twelve
and
i
was
just
brushing
my
hair
for
the
third
time
preparatory
to
starting
for
bancroft
road
when
the
chambermaid
came
to
the
bedroom
door
this
note
was
just
left
for
you
i
tore
it
open
bancroft
road
sunday
morning
my
dear
blair
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
it
very
strange
but
owing
to
a
sudden
domestic
disarrangement
will
you
come
to
this
evening
instead
of
to
luncheon
i
am
exceedingly
embarrassed
to
have
to
make
this
change
but
to
be
quite
frank
one
of
our
maids
has
been
taken
ill
and
our
luncheon
will
have
to
be
a
haphazard
affair
we
are
also
rather
distressed
by
strange
news
from
our
cousin
at
oxford
but
we
shall
be
very
happy
to
see
you
at
supper
time
seven
cordially
yours
philip
kent
it
came
over
me
that
this
was
pretty
dirty
work
we
were
putting
up
on
the
poor
gentleman
and
i
suddenly
felt
thoroughly
ashamed
of
myself
i
do
know
whether
any
of
the
others
came
back
to
the
boar
for
lunch
or
not
i
put
on
my
cap
and
went
for
a
long
walk
in
the
country
out
toward
tettenhall
wood
i
did
come
back
until
tea
time
vii
as
johnny
blair
approached
number
bancroft
road
a
little
before
seven
that
bland
march
evening
he
bore
within
his
hardy
breast
certain
delicacies
remorses
doubts
and
revulsions
but
all
these
were
transcended
by
his
overmastering
determination
to
see
this
superb
and
maiden
near
at
hand
bancroft
road
proved
to
be
a
docile
suburban
thoroughfare
lined
with
comfortable
villas
and
double
houses
each
standing
a
little
back
from
the
street
with
a
small
garden
in
front
a
afterglow
lingered
in
the
sky
and
the
gas
lights
along
the
pavement
still
burned
pale
and
white
just
as
the
rhodes
scholar
passed
number
he
saw
a
feminine
figure
run
down
the
steps
of
a
house
fifty
yards
farther
on
cross
the
pavement
and
drop
a
letter
into
the
red
pillar
box
standing
there
even
at
that
distance
he
distinguished
a
lively
slimness
in
the
girlish
outline
that
could
belong
to
no
other
than
the
incomparable
kathleen
he
hastened
his
step
casting
hesitance
to
the
wind
but
she
had
already
run
back
into
the
house
it
would
have
added
to
the
problems
blair
was
pondering
could
he
have
read
the
letter
which
had
just
dropped
into
the
perhaps
it
will
somewhat
advance
the
course
of
the
narrative
to
give
the
reader
a
glimpse
of
it
bancroft
road
sunday
afternoon
dear
joe
goodness
knows
what
has
happened
to
this
usually
placid
house
never
again
will
i
complain
to
you
that
there
is
no
excitement
in
wolverhampton
i
got
home
from
birmingham
yesterday
noon
and
since
then
everything
has
been
perfectly
absurd
i
can
only
believe
you
have
gone
balmy
first
comes
your
wire
about
blair
and
your
having
hurt
your
arm
playing
soccer
what
you
can
have
been
doing
at
soccer
i
ca
conceive
i
supposed
it
was
a
mistake
for
hockey
or
else
some
kind
of
a
twit
well
i
could
see
what
i
could
do
to
help
a
historical
student
but
i
showed
dad
the
wire
and
the
old
dear
said
he
would
write
blair
a
line
i
had
just
settled
down
to
help
mother
with
some
sewing
when
along
comes
your
second
wire
addressed
to
her
mother
and
i
threw
up
our
hands
and
screamed
certainly
we
thought
you
were
off
your
crumpet
why
on
earth
should
you
send
us
another
cook
when
you
know
ethel
has
been
here
for
so
long
i
read
the
wire
forward
and
backward
but
it
could
mean
nothing
else
it
said
found
very
good
cook
out
of
place
am
sending
her
to
you
earnestly
recommend
give
her
a
trial
reliable
woman
but
eccentric
name
eliza
thick
will
call
sunday
well
we
all
had
a
good
laugh
over
this
and
wondered
what
kind
of
a
joke
you
were
up
to
then
after
supper
to
our
amazement
came
a
third
wire
not
from
you
this
one
but
to
dad
and
who
do
you
suppose
from
the
bishop
of
oxford
if
you
please
dad
was
so
flustered
you
know
how
telegrams
excite
him
they
offend
all
his
antiquarian
instincts
well
the
bishop
said
sending
my
favourite
curate
to
call
on
you
magnificent
young
fellow
excellent
family
very
worthy
chap
will
be
in
wolverhampton
a
day
or
two
anxious
to
have
him
meet
your
well
this
rather
flabbergasted
us
but
dad
took
it
rather
as
a
matter
of
course
after
the
first
surprise
he
used
to
know
the
bishop
well
in
fact
he
dedicated
his
book
to
him
quite
all
right
my
dear
dad
kept
saying
i
dare
say
the
young
man
has
some
antiquarian
problems
to
talk
over
too
bad
i
so
crippled
with
after
supper
along
came
dunton
and
began
to
talk
about
a
charming
young
american
who
had
been
calling
on
him
and
who
did
it
prove
to
be
but
your
friend
blair
who
had
been
quite
put
out
of
our
minds
by
the
later
telegrams
so
dad
sat
down
right
away
and
wrote
a
note
to
blair
at
the
blue
boar
asking
him
for
luncheon
and
sent
it
up
by
the
gardener
boy
but
this
morning
when
i
had
just
decided
not
to
go
to
church
see
why
in
a
minute
comes
your
perfectly
mad
message
to
fred
about
hurting
your
leg
at
soccer
and
all
the
rest
of
it
this
convinced
us
that
you
are
quite
crazy
how
could
we
send
fred
all
that
way
alone
and
when
did
you
take
up
soccer
anyway
but
we
know
what
a
mad
creature
you
are
anyway
so
we
simply
suspected
some
twit
now
i
come
to
the
queerest
thing
of
all
ethel
went
out
last
night
for
her
usual
saturday
evening
off
and
has
returned
in
all
the
years
she
been
with
us
mother
says
the
first
time
such
a
thing
ever
happened
and
before
breakfast
this
morning
turns
up
this
eliza
thick
person
of
yours
with
a
note
from
ethel
to
say
that
she
was
sick
but
that
her
friend
eliza
would
see
us
through
for
a
day
or
so
well
you
surely
have
a
queer
eye
for
picking
out
domestics
of
all
the
figures
of
fun
i
ever
imagined
she
is
the
strangest
i
do
think
she
quite
right
in
her
head
i
tell
you
all
about
her
when
i
see
you
really
i
roar
with
laughter
every
time
i
look
at
her
i
have
got
time
to
say
more
with
this
eliza
person
in
the
kitchen
goodness
knows
what
may
happen
we
had
to
send
a
note
to
blair
not
to
come
for
luncheon
the
house
was
so
upset
we
heard
a
fearful
uproar
in
the
lower
regions
this
afternoon
and
found
eliza
engaged
in
ejecting
some
kind
of
who
said
he
had
come
to
see
the
meter
on
sunday
if
you
please
everything
seems
quite
topsy
turvy
and
blair
is
coming
to
supper
in
a
few
minutes
and
that
favourite
curate
of
the
bishop
too
i
think
i
shall
have
to
stay
down
in
the
kitchen
to
see
that
eliza
thick
gets
through
with
it
all
right
i
can
forgive
you
almost
anything
except
her
never
never
say
again
that
nothing
happens
in
bancroft
road
yours
kathleen
viii
a
housemaid
in
the
correct
evening
uniform
admitted
blair
and
in
the
he
found
kent
sitting
by
a
shining
fire
points
of
light
twinkled
in
the
polished
balls
of
the
brass
andirons
as
soon
as
he
entered
blair
felt
the
comely
atmosphere
of
a
charming
and
home
books
lined
the
walls
a
french
window
opened
on
to
the
lawn
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
a
large
bowl
of
blue
hyacinths
growing
in
a
bed
of
pebbles
stood
on
the
reading
table
kent
was
small
with
a
clear
pink
complexion
and
a
guileless
blue
eye
mr
blair
he
said
laying
down
his
paper
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
a
friend
of
joe
is
always
welcome
here
and
particularly
when
he
an
antiquarian
i
know
you
excuse
our
seeming
rudeness
in
putting
you
off
at
blair
bowed
and
made
some
polite
reply
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
kent
my
wife
was
embarrassed
this
morning
by
strange
happenings
in
the
domestic
department
our
cook
usually
very
faithful
did
not
turn
up
and
sent
a
substitute
who
has
caused
her
well
mingled
annoyance
and
amusement
i
have
not
seen
the
woman
myself
my
rheumatism
has
kept
me
pretty
close
to
the
fire
this
damp
weather
but
by
all
accounts
the
creature
is
very
extraordinary
well
well
you
are
not
interested
in
that
of
course
it
is
very
pleasant
to
meet
a
fellow
antiquarian
how
did
you
happen
to
visit
wolverhampton
we
have
a
number
of
quite
unusual
relics
in
these
parts
but
they
are
not
so
well
known
as
they
should
to
tell
the
truth
sir
said
blair
it
was
your
book
which
i
came
across
in
the
college
library
i
was
particularly
interested
in
your
account
of
philip
church
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
ought
to
see
it
you
see
we
in
america
have
so
little
antiquity
of
our
own
that
these
relics
of
old
england
are
peculiarly
fascinating
to
quite
so
quite
so
said
kent
rubbing
his
hands
with
pleasure
magnificent
well
well
it
is
certainly
a
delight
to
hear
you
say
so
after
supper
we
will
dismiss
the
ladies
and
have
a
good
crack
there
are
some
really
startling
things
to
be
learned
about
wolverhampton
in
times
you
know
the
town
lay
along
the
frontier
that
was
much
harried
by
the
danes
and
edward
the
elder
won
a
conspicuous
victory
over
the
invaders
at
tettenhall
which
is
a
village
very
near
yes
said
blair
i
walked
out
there
this
did
you
indeed
well
that
was
a
proof
of
your
perspicacity
you
may
recall
that
in
my
book
i
referred
to
the
battle
at
tettenhall
that
was
in
was
it
not
queried
blair
adroitly
precisely
it
is
mentioned
in
the
edward
the
elder
died
in
did
he
asked
the
ruthless
american
about
that
time
i
think
i
do
remember
exactly
upon
my
word
blair
you
have
taken
up
history
with
true
american
efficiency
i
do
wish
that
our
young
men
had
the
same
zeal
i
am
happy
to
say
however
that
i
am
expecting
a
young
cleric
this
evening
a
protege
of
the
bishop
of
oxford
who
is
i
believe
also
interested
in
these
blair
heart
sank
but
he
had
no
time
to
ponder
for
at
this
moment
kent
and
kathleen
came
in
my
dear
this
is
blair
joe
friend
from
oxford
we
are
great
cronies
already
my
wife
blair
and
my
daughter
the
young
oxonian
suffered
one
of
the
most
severe
heart
contusions
known
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
it
was
a
positive
vertigo
of
admiration
this
was
indeed
the
creature
he
had
seen
on
the
railway
platform
a
dazzling
blend
of
girl
and
woman
the
grotesque
appellation
flapper
fled
from
his
mind
her
thick
dark
hair
was
drawn
smoothly
across
her
head
and
piled
at
the
back
in
a
heavenly
coil
her
clear
gray
eyes
under
rich
brown
brows
were
cool
laughing
and
she
was
that
most
adorable
of
creatures
the
tweenie
between
girl
and
woman
with
the
magic
of
both
and
the
weaknesses
of
neither
blair
could
not
have
said
how
she
was
dressed
he
saw
only
the
arch
face
the
intoxicating
clearness
of
her
skin
the
steady
friendly
gaze
how
do
you
do
he
said
and
remembering
english
reticence
hesitated
to
put
out
his
hand
then
cursed
himself
for
not
having
done
so
kathleen
smiled
and
murmured
how
do
you
i
very
glad
to
see
you
said
kent
do
tell
us
what
that
crazy
joe
has
been
up
to
did
kent
tell
you
we
had
three
telegrams
from
her
blair
felt
the
room
twirl
under
his
feet
how
one
little
pronoun
can
destroy
a
man
in
his
agony
he
saw
kent
and
kathleen
sit
down
on
the
big
couch
and
painfully
found
his
way
to
a
chair
i
i
beg
your
pardon
he
stammered
i
did
just
catch
the
mad
girl
has
sent
us
three
telegrams
said
kent
in
which
there
was
only
one
sensible
thing
the
reference
to
yourself
her
other
remarks
about
cooks
and
soccer
and
injured
limbs
were
quite
over
our
with
a
dull
sense
of
pain
blair
felt
kathleen
bright
eyes
on
him
yes
blair
is
she
ragging
us
or
have
the
girls
at
maggie
hall
taken
up
soccer
said
a
clear
voice
every
syllable
of
which
seemed
so
precious
and
girlish
and
quaintly
english
that
he
could
have
clapped
his
hands
he
blessed
her
for
the
clue
maggie
hall
in
other
words
lady
margaret
hall
one
of
the
women
colleges
at
oxford
so
joe
was
in
american
parlance
a
why
er
i
believe
they
been
playing
a
little
he
said
desperately
i
think
he
er
something
was
said
about
having
his
hum
her
arm
hurt
in
a
rough
her
leg
too
said
kent
in
my
time
young
girls
did
send
telegrams
about
their
legs
in
fact
they
did
send
telegrams
at
well
we
are
quite
nonplussed
said
kent
kathleen
says
joe
must
have
had
a
rush
of
humour
to
the
head
she
wired
for
us
to
send
fred
down
to
her
of
course
she
has
sent
wires
to
fred
before
as
a
joke
but
she
must
have
known
we
could
send
him
so
far
alone
i
suppose
joe
has
told
you
all
about
fred
he
quite
one
of
the
yes
said
the
distracted
oxonian
he
must
be
a
fine
fellow
i
very
anxious
to
meet
there
was
a
ring
at
the
front
door
bell
and
in
a
kind
of
stupor
blair
realized
that
something
he
hardly
knew
what
was
about
to
happen
the
reverend
carter
announced
the
maid
blair
had
a
keen
desire
to
scream
but
he
kept
his
eyes
firmly
on
the
rug
until
he
had
mastered
himself
in
the
general
movement
that
followed
he
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
seize
a
chair
next
to
kathleen
he
saw
falstaff
burly
figure
enter
habited
as
the
conventional
black
beetle
of
the
church
and
in
the
sharpened
state
of
his
wits
noticed
that
the
unpractised
curate
had
put
on
his
clerical
collar
the
wrong
way
round
he
rejoiced
in
carter
look
of
dismay
on
finding
his
already
on
the
battlefield
mr
carter
said
kent
this
is
blair
of
the
two
shook
hands
gravely
blair
determined
to
make
use
of
his
information
to
set
carter
astray
i
know
carter
by
reputation
he
said
i
have
heard
joe
speak
of
him
in
terms
of
great
the
curate
looked
worried
but
tried
to
play
safe
oh
yes
joe
he
said
splendid
blair
made
haste
to
get
back
to
the
chair
he
coveted
he
had
no
idea
what
mad
schemes
might
lurk
beneath
carter
episcopalian
frock
and
was
determined
to
gain
any
headway
he
could
it
seems
funny
your
coming
to
wolverhampton
said
kathleen
so
few
men
ever
get
here
but
it
certainly
a
blessing
for
dad
talk
antiquities
with
you
as
long
as
you
are
you
interested
in
the
subject
asked
blair
i
afraid
not
she
laughed
it
too
bad
dad
is
so
laid
up
with
his
lumbago
he
love
to
walk
you
out
to
tettenhall
and
boscobel
to
see
his
burial
how
very
interesting
said
blair
a
kind
of
private
family
cemetery
oh
dear
no
declared
kathleen
in
amazement
antiquities
you
know
where
the
danes
buried
of
course
of
course
how
i
wish
i
could
see
them
are
you
fond
of
walking
yes
when
it
is
too
muddy
it
been
too
wet
lately
to
go
out
with
fred
he
loves
a
good
long
walk
but
he
getting
old
and
his
rheumatism
bothers
i
dare
say
he
may
have
inherited
that
from
your
father
it
very
common
among
scotties
said
kathleen
oh
is
your
family
scotch
said
blair
feverishly
trying
to
be
polite
our
family
queried
kathleen
with
a
smile
heavens
no
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
fred
you
must
see
him
he
somewhere
i
should
love
to
meet
him
said
blair
kathleen
went
to
the
door
and
whistled
there
was
a
scampering
on
the
stairs
and
a
grizzled
skye
terrier
trotted
into
the
room
blair
and
carter
looked
at
each
other
sheepishly
kent
had
been
referring
to
his
watch
several
times
and
blair
began
to
suspect
that
something
was
wrong
but
just
then
supper
was
announced
as
they
passed
into
the
the
american
thought
he
noticed
signs
of
agitation
on
the
maid
face
he
wondered
secretly
what
the
rest
of
the
scorpions
were
up
to
ix
come
blair
said
kent
you
sit
there
next
to
kent
where
you
can
talk
about
archaeology
carter
tells
me
he
knows
nothing
about
such
subjects
so
he
will
have
to
amuse
kathleen
and
what
errand
brings
you
to
wolverhampton
carter
inquired
blair
thinking
to
unmask
his
opponent
weapons
as
quickly
as
possible
carter
was
a
little
staggered
by
this
but
his
effrontery
was
up
to
the
test
the
bishop
sent
me
down
he
said
to
look
over
the
surrounding
parishes
with
a
view
to
establishing
a
chapel
in
the
how
very
interesting
exclaimed
kent
but
surely
this
does
not
lie
in
the
oxford
diocese
quite
true
said
carter
the
bishop
had
to
get
special
permission
from
parliament
an
old
statute
of
the
fourteenth
century
i
indeed
indeed
cried
kent
how
absorbing
my
dear
carter
you
must
tell
me
more
about
that
i
take
it
you
are
something
of
a
historical
student
after
i
afraid
not
sir
replied
carter
my
studies
in
divinity
have
been
too
exacting
to
leave
much
opportunity
you
must
not
believe
carter
disclaimers
said
blair
i
have
heard
of
his
papers
before
the
oxford
historical
society
he
has
a
very
sound
antiquarian
instinct
i
think
you
would
find
his
ideas
of
great
we
were
speaking
of
the
battle
with
the
danes
at
tettenhall
observed
kent
turning
to
blair
i
think
that
if
kathleen
could
arrange
to
take
you
out
there
you
would
find
the
burial
mounds
of
unusual
interest
my
dear
could
you
walk
out
there
with
blair
morning
kathleen
assented
but
blair
noticed
that
she
was
not
eating
her
soup
he
also
noticed
that
the
maid
in
the
background
was
seized
with
occasional
spasms
which
he
was
at
a
loss
to
interpret
did
i
hear
you
say
tettenhall
ventured
carter
that
is
the
very
place
the
bishop
mentioned
to
me
he
was
particularly
anxious
that
i
should
go
you
must
come
with
us
by
all
means
said
kathleen
bravo
said
kent
beaming
genially
upon
the
young
people
i
wish
i
could
go
with
you
you
know
they
say
wulfruna
the
widow
of
the
earl
of
northampton
who
founded
wolverhampton
had
a
kind
of
summer
place
once
near
tettenhall
and
i
claim
to
have
located
by
the
way
my
dear
what
do
you
suppose
has
happened
to
this
soup
i
think
that
eliza
thick
has
a
heavy
hand
with
the
condiments
said
kent
you
may
take
it
away
now
as
i
recall
wulfruna
founded
the
town
about
observed
blair
i
presume
it
takes
its
name
from
her
exactly
really
blair
your
historical
knowledge
does
you
honour
i
had
no
idea
that
americans
were
such
keen
students
of
the
blair
began
to
think
that
he
had
overplayed
his
hand
for
he
noticed
that
falstaff
was
getting
in
some
private
conversation
with
kathleen
he
attempted
to
catch
her
eye
to
ask
a
question
but
kent
was
now
well
launched
on
his
hobby
wulfruna
was
descended
from
ethelhild
who
was
a
granddaughter
of
alfred
the
great
you
recall
that
the
etheling
ethelwold
the
son
of
alfred
brother
ethelred
took
sides
with
the
danes
to
stem
the
invasion
edward
and
his
sister
ethelfled
ethel
fled
that
just
the
trouble
interposed
kent
kathleen
my
dear
do
run
downstairs
and
see
what
wrong
in
the
kitchen
afraid
eliza
is
in
difficulties
again
blair
you
and
carter
must
excuse
this
irregularity
our
substitute
cook
is
a
very
strange
kathleen
left
the
room
and
it
seemed
to
blair
as
though
the
sparkle
had
fled
from
the
glasses
the
gleam
of
candlelight
from
the
silver
across
the
cloth
he
had
watched
her
girlish
debonair
and
with
a
secret
laughter
lurking
in
her
eyes
and
yet
he
had
not
had
a
chance
to
exchange
half
a
dozen
sentences
with
her
the
maid
reentered
whispered
something
to
kent
and
began
to
place
the
dishes
for
the
next
course
kathleen
begs
to
be
excused
said
kent
she
thinks
she
had
better
stay
in
the
kitchen
to
help
oh
i
say
cried
the
curate
that
too
bad
do
you
think
i
could
help
kent
i
a
very
good
cook
the
bishop
himself
has
praised
my
er
my
your
what
asked
blair
my
ham
and
eggs
retorted
the
cleric
perhaps
you
will
let
me
wash
the
dishes
suggested
blair
i
should
be
only
too
happy
to
assist
i
feel
very
embarrassed
at
having
intruded
upon
you
at
so
inconvenient
a
i
should
not
dream
of
such
a
thing
said
kent
i
believe
that
eliza
is
perfectly
capable
but
as
joe
said
she
is
i
am
quite
accustomed
to
washing
dishes
said
carter
in
fact
the
bishop
always
used
to
ask
me
to
do
it
for
dear
me
remarked
kent
surely
the
bishop
has
plenty
of
servants
to
help
in
such
matters
blair
applied
himself
to
the
food
on
his
plate
to
which
he
had
helped
himself
almost
unconsciously
he
well
knew
the
daring
hardihood
of
his
rival
and
feared
that
the
other
might
find
some
excuse
to
follow
kathleen
to
the
kitchen
as
he
raised
his
fork
to
his
lips
suddenly
his
hand
halted
the
dish
was
stuffed
eggs
his
mind
reverted
to
the
public
library
the
evening
before
was
it
possible
that
the
goblin
he
determined
that
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
get
carter
so
firmly
engaged
with
kent
that
the
wolf
in
cleric
clothing
could
not
withdraw
then
perhaps
he
himself
could
frame
some
excuse
for
seeing
what
was
going
on
downstairs
mr
kent
he
said
you
should
draw
out
carter
concerning
his
views
on
amending
the
liturgy
of
the
established
church
he
has
some
very
advanced
ideas
on
that
subject
which
have
attracted
much
attention
at
oxford
one
of
his
interesting
suggestions
is
that
radical
churchmen
should
wear
the
clerical
collar
back
side
foremost
as
a
kind
of
symbol
of
their
inverted
the
wretched
carter
hand
flew
to
his
neck
and
he
glared
across
the
table
in
a
very
unecclesiastical
manner
really
said
kent
that
is
most
interesting
i
had
noticed
his
modification
of
the
customary
dress
in
what
other
ways
carter
would
you
amend
the
ritual
the
unfortunate
curate
was
caught
er
hum
well
that
is
the
bishop
and
i
both
think
that
the
service
is
too
long
he
faltered
i
am
in
favour
of
omitting
the
hear
hear
cried
kent
it
is
most
refreshing
to
hear
a
high
churchman
make
such
a
confession
and
what
else
do
you
propose
why
ah
hum
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
articles
might
well
be
somewhat
bravo
indeed
though
i
fear
the
bishop
would
balk
at
that
said
his
host
the
maid
appearing
in
the
again
whispered
to
kent
philip
said
the
latter
that
is
here
again
and
says
he
see
the
meter
he
claims
that
there
is
a
dangerous
leak
which
should
be
fixed
at
once
perhaps
i
had
better
go
down
to
the
cellar
with
him
your
rheumatism
my
dear
kent
cried
the
curate
seeing
his
chance
do
nothing
of
the
sort
it
is
the
privilege
of
my
cloth
to
take
precedence
when
there
is
danger
of
any
kind
if
any
one
should
be
overcome
by
fumes
the
consolations
of
the
church
may
be
and
without
waiting
for
another
word
he
leaped
up
and
ran
from
the
room
blair
fidgeted
in
his
chair
seeing
himself
outwitted
but
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
pray
go
on
with
your
supper
blair
urged
kent
you
must
overlook
anything
that
seems
strange
this
evening
everything
seems
to
be
widdershins
perhaps
because
it
is
patrick
day
i
do
believe
that
woman
in
the
kitchen
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
these
stuffed
eggs
are
positively
uneatable
if
i
were
not
crippled
with
this
lumbago
i
would
go
down
and
fire
her
out
of
the
let
me
do
it
for
you
cried
blair
half
rising
from
his
seat
nonsense
i
not
going
to
sacrifice
our
good
talk
on
antiquities
so
easily
i
want
very
much
to
tell
you
about
the
battle
of
wolverhampton
the
town
was
strongly
loyalist
in
the
great
rebellion
in
fact
in
it
was
the
headquarters
of
prince
rupert
while
charles
the
first
is
said
to
have
stopped
at
the
blue
boar
for
a
drink
at
this
moment
came
a
ring
at
the
front
door
and
kent
stopped
to
listen
they
heard
a
male
voice
mumbling
to
the
maid
who
then
came
to
her
mistress
to
report
there
a
policeman
out
here
to
see
a
policeman
queried
the
antiquarian
what
next
i
wonder
well
supper
is
suspended
send
him
and
to
blair
dismay
the
gigantic
form
of
whitney
the
iron
duke
crossed
the
threshold
in
the
correct
uniform
of
the
wolverhampton
police
force
if
blair
was
dismayed
the
counterfeit
policeman
was
no
less
disgusted
to
see
his
fellow
scorpion
sitting
at
the
dinner
table
but
they
gazed
at
each
other
without
any
sign
of
recognition
begging
your
pardon
for
interrupting
sir
but
the
chief
sent
me
around
for
a
word
with
you
there
been
a
gang
o
sneak
thieves
operating
sir
and
some
of
been
getting
admittance
to
by
passin
themselves
off
as
gas
inspectors
kent
screamed
i
a
notion
that
one
o
these
birds
is
along
bancroft
road
sir
an
i
wanted
to
warn
you
do
let
the
maid
admit
any
tradesmen
or
agents
from
the
gas
company
unless
they
the
proper
badges
heavens
philip
cried
kent
that
dreadful
man
is
downstairs
now
eliza
threw
him
out
once
this
afternoon
but
he
here
again
he
may
have
murdered
carter
by
this
time
oh
inspector
do
hurry
down
at
once
and
see
what
happened
there
a
defenceless
curate
in
the
cellar
with
him
mary
show
the
way
blair
poured
out
a
glass
of
water
for
kent
do
you
think
i
had
better
go
down
too
he
asked
oh
please
do
go
begged
kent
faintly
stay
here
in
case
he
should
escape
upstairs
i
believe
we
shall
all
be
murdered
in
our
beds
come
come
said
kent
we
must
let
all
this
spoil
supper
have
another
glass
of
wine
the
policeman
will
attend
to
the
we
do
often
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
a
genuine
antiquarian
i
think
blair
that
you
will
be
greatly
interested
in
the
architectural
restoration
of
our
parish
church
it
exemplifies
the
worst
excesses
of
the
period
the
church
itself
is
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
cruciform
type
the
south
transept
dates
from
the
thirteenth
century
the
nave
clerestory
and
north
transept
from
the
fifth
the
chancel
was
restored
in
but
i
must
confess
that
the
treatment
of
the
clerestory
seems
to
me
barbarous
now
what
are
your
own
ideas
as
to
the
proper
treatment
of
a
clerestory
the
wretched
american
was
he
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
matters
were
moving
rapidly
downstairs
yet
he
did
not
see
any
way
of
leaving
the
to
investigate
for
himself
he
had
hardly
heard
what
was
said
why
ah
to
tell
you
the
truth
kent
i
read
very
little
fiction
nowadays
i
rather
worried
about
that
downstairs
do
you
suppose
your
daughter
can
be
in
any
danger
there
might
be
some
sort
of
explosion
do
you
think
i
had
better
run
down
to
see
if
i
can
help
as
they
sat
listening
kathleen
voice
was
heard
from
the
kitchen
raised
in
clear
and
angry
tones
blair
could
contain
himself
no
longer
with
an
inarticulate
apology
he
hurried
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
puzzled
antiquarian
and
his
wife
alone
at
the
supper
table
x
the
rhodes
scholar
was
correct
in
having
feared
the
goblin
as
a
dangerous
competitor
in
the
quest
of
the
grail
king
as
we
have
intimated
before
was
a
and
ingenious
person
modest
in
stature
but
with
a
twinkling
and
roving
eye
he
was
one
of
the
leading
spirits
of
the
ouds
known
in
full
as
the
oxford
university
dramatic
society
and
his
ability
to
portray
females
of
the
lower
classes
had
been
the
delight
of
more
than
one
shakespearean
rendering
no
one
who
saw
him
as
juliet
nurse
in
a
certain
private
theatrical
performance
in
the
hall
of
new
college
can
recall
the
occasion
without
chuckles
when
the
goblin
left
the
blue
boar
on
saturday
afternoon
he
also
made
his
way
out
to
bancroft
road
but
instead
of
patrolling
the
main
street
in
the
vague
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
kathleen
as
did
falstaff
priapus
and
the
iron
duke
he
hunted
out
the
hinder
regions
of
the
district
in
accordance
with
a
plan
he
had
concocted
before
leaving
oxford
he
carried
a
little
portfolio
of
art
subjects
of
the
kind
dear
to
domestic
servants
and
with
this
in
hand
he
approached
the
door
of
the
basement
back
kitchen
where
ethel
the
cook
and
her
assistant
mary
the
housemaid
were
having
a
cup
of
tea
the
windings
of
the
humbler
lanes
of
service
behind
the
bancroft
road
houses
were
the
proper
causeway
for
tradesmen
and
it
was
easy
for
him
to
reach
the
back
garden
gate
unseen
by
those
in
front
he
knocked
respectfully
at
the
kitchen
door
and
mary
came
to
answer
good
day
miss
said
the
supposed
pedlar
i
some
very
pretty
pictures
which
i
wish
you
would
let
me
show
mary
was
a
creature
but
she
knew
that
her
mistress
had
strict
rules
about
pedlars
i
sorry
she
said
but
missus
do
let
no
pedlars
in
the
if
you
please
miss
said
the
artful
goblin
i
am
no
pedlar
but
representing
a
very
respectable
photographer
and
i
would
like
to
show
you
some
photographs
in
the
of
getting
your
order
i
taken
a
number
of
orders
at
the
nicest
along
bancroft
road
i
thought
maybe
you
would
like
to
a
photo
of
yourself
taken
to
send
to
your
young
and
he
opened
his
case
exhibiting
a
sheaf
of
appropriate
photos
it
was
a
slender
chance
but
the
pedlar
had
a
wheedling
eye
and
a
genteel
demeanour
and
mary
hesitated
she
called
the
cook
a
stout
person
who
came
to
the
door
to
see
what
was
up
the
pedlar
rapidly
showed
the
best
items
of
his
collection
which
he
had
selected
with
great
care
in
a
photographer
studio
in
oxford
fate
hung
in
the
scales
but
the
two
servants
could
not
resist
temptation
they
knew
that
kent
and
miss
kathleen
were
upstairs
sewing
and
the
master
was
confined
to
his
study
with
his
rheumatism
they
invited
the
photographer
into
the
kitchen
it
is
a
psychological
fact
well
known
to
housekeepers
that
there
is
a
vacant
hour
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
satan
sometimes
finds
a
joint
in
the
protective
armour
of
the
domestic
servant
after
the
luncheon
dishes
are
washed
and
put
away
and
before
tea
and
toast
are
served
cook
and
housemaid
enjoy
a
period
of
philosophic
contemplation
or
siesta
even
in
the
most
docile
and
breast
thoughts
of
roses
and
romance
may
linger
dreams
of
moving
pictures
or
the
coming
cotillion
of
the
icemen
social
harmony
usually
this
critical
time
is
whiled
away
by
the
fiction
of
nat
gould
or
bertha
clay
or
harold
bell
wright
and
close
observers
of
kitchen
comedy
will
have
noted
that
it
is
always
at
this
fallow
hour
of
the
afternoon
that
pedlars
and
other
satanic
emissaries
sharpen
their
arrows
and
ply
their
most
plausible
seductions
the
goblin
has
never
admitted
just
what
honeyed
sophistries
he
employed
to
win
the
hearts
of
the
simple
pair
in
kent
kitchen
but
the
facts
may
be
briefly
stated
by
the
chronicler
after
getting
them
interested
in
his
photos
he
confessed
frankly
that
he
was
an
old
friend
of
the
family
from
oxford
he
said
that
he
and
miss
kathleen
were
planning
an
innocent
practical
joke
on
the
family
and
asked
if
he
could
take
the
place
of
one
of
the
servants
for
that
sunday
he
made
plain
that
his
share
in
the
joke
must
not
be
revealed
to
any
one
and
then
he
played
his
trump
card
by
showing
them
the
text
of
the
bogus
telegram
recommending
miss
eliza
thick
which
he
had
dispatched
from
a
branch
postal
office
on
his
way
through
the
town
and
is
miss
josephine
in
the
joke
too
inquired
the
cook
this
question
startled
the
goblin
but
he
kept
his
composure
and
affirmed
that
he
and
miss
josephine
had
concocted
the
telegram
jointly
in
oxford
and
by
a
little
adroit
pumping
he
learned
joe
status
in
the
family
the
cook
ethel
admitted
that
she
was
to
go
out
that
evening
for
her
saturday
night
off
at
last
the
goblin
by
desperate
cunning
and
the
exhibition
of
two
golden
sovereigns
completely
won
the
hearts
of
the
maids
while
they
were
talking
the
rang
and
mary
returning
from
the
upper
regions
announced
that
it
was
another
telegram
from
miss
joe
missus
and
miss
kathleen
laughed
fit
to
kill
when
they
read
it
she
said
you
see
said
the
goblin
that
the
same
telegram
i
just
showed
you
it
all
right
it
a
joke
you
do
need
to
worry
cook
kent
wo
be
angry
with
you
you
let
me
take
your
place
for
and
write
a
little
note
saying
you
ill
and
that
your
friend
eliza
thick
will
do
your
work
for
the
it
was
arranged
that
the
goblin
should
meet
ethel
at
her
home
that
night
to
borrow
some
clothes
the
cook
showed
him
the
menu
for
sunday
that
kent
had
sent
down
this
rather
daunted
the
candidate
for
kitchen
honours
but
he
copied
it
in
his
notebook
for
intensive
study
then
as
it
was
close
upon
he
packed
up
the
photos
distributed
his
largesse
and
retired
mary
the
housemaid
promised
to
stand
by
him
in
the
coming
ordeal
both
the
servants
felt
secretly
flattered
that
they
should
be
included
in
the
hoax
the
kitchen
classes
in
england
have
great
reverence
for
young
men
the
goblin
was
a
canny
man
and
he
had
brought
with
him
a
wig
and
certain
other
properties
he
hunted
out
a
little
tea
shop
where
he
meditated
over
three
cups
of
pekoe
and
hot
buttered
toast
then
he
made
his
way
to
the
public
library
where
he
spent
several
hours
over
a
he
was
complimenting
himself
on
having
shaken
the
other
scorpions
off
his
trail
when
blair
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
recipe
to
which
the
goblin
was
addressing
himself
for
the
fourth
time
the
meeting
was
embarrassing
but
it
could
not
be
helped
after
blair
had
left
him
the
returned
to
his
memoranda
kent
trusted
many
things
to
ethel
judgment
and
her
instructions
as
jotted
down
on
a
slip
of
paper
included
three
possibilities
stuffed
devilled
or
she
had
written
and
the
goblin
was
endeavouring
to
decide
which
of
these
presented
the
least
distressing
responsibility
he
was
a
student
of
mathematics
and
had
attempted
to
reduce
the
problem
to
a
logical
syllabus
he
read
over
his
memoranda
theorem

eggs
six
hard
minutes
a
cut
eggs

halves
lengthwise
b
remove

and
put

add

the
amount
of
devilled
ham
enough
melted
butter
to
make
of
consistency
to
shape
half

of

ham
thought
the
goblin
and
where
does
the
devilled
ham
come
from
how
does
one
devil
a
ham
what
a
pity
henry
james
never
wrote
a

would
have
been
lucid
compared
to
this

what
on
earth

that

he
said
to
himself
as
he
reviewed
the
problem
i
hope
they
have
plenty
of
parsley
in
the
house
that
nest
may
need
a

i
do
see
how
i
can
make
any
kind
of
proper
asylum
for
those
homeless
wandering
eggs
out
of
that
so
saying
he
left
the
library
to
call
upon
ethel
at
her
home
and
complete
his
disguise
xi
kent
was
a
deal
puzzled
by
the
bearing
and
accoutrements
of
her
substitute
cook
eliza
thick
appeared
on
the
premises
about
seven
and
with
the
aid
of
the
housemaid
breakfast
went
through
fairly
smoothly
it
was
kathleen
query
about
the
coffee
that
elicited
the
truth
mary
with
nervous
gigglings
announced
to
her
mistress
that
ethel
was
ill
and
had
sent
a
substitute
the
coincidence
that
josephine
nominee
should
turn
out
to
be
a
friend
of
ethel
struck
kent
as
strange
and
presently
she
went
down
to
interview
the
new
kitcheneer
eliza
thick
a
but
rather
powerfully
fashioned
female
generously
busted
and
well
furnished
with
rich
brown
hair
was
washing
the
dishes
she
curtseyed
respectfully
as
kent
entered
the
kitchen
good
morning
said
kent
you
are
eliza
thick
yes
you
brought
a
note
from
ethel
yes
and
fumbling
in
an
opulent
bosom
eliza
drew
forth
a
crumpled
scrap
of
paper
i
had
a
telegram
from
my
niece
in
oxford
recommending
you
how
did
she
know
of
you
i
worked
at
lady
where
the
young
lady
is
why
did
you
leave
your
place
there
if
you
please
my
dishes
was
so
tasty
that
it
made
the
young
ladies
discontented
when
they
got
their
parents
complained
that
it
gave
too
ideas
about
wittles
the
principal
said
i
was
pamperin
too
much
an
offered
to
release
mary
who
was
listening
gave
a
loud
snort
of
laughter
which
she
tried
to
conceal
by
rattling
some
plates
well
eliza
said
kent
that
will
do
you
must
get
on
with
the
work
as
best
you
can
judging
by
the
coffee
this
morning
i
do
think
your
cooking
will
have
the
same
effect
on
us
that
it
did
on
the
students
at
lady
margaret
hall
we
were
expecting
a
guest
for
lunch
but
i
will
have
to
put
him
off
until
supper
i
have
written
out
the
menu
for
the
day
mary
will
give
you
any
help
she
if
you
please
said
eliza
yes
cook
gave
me
a
message
for
miss
kathleen
which
she
asked
me
to
deliver
in
a
message
for
miss
kathleen
yes
well
you
can
tell
me
i
will
tell
miss
cook
said
i
was
to
give
it
to
her
personally
said
the
persistent
eliza
how
very
extraordinary
said
kent
what
did
you
say
was
the
matter
with
ethel
is
it
anything
contagious
oh
no
i
think
it
just
a
touch
of
of
nervous
debility
too
many
white
corpuscles
well
i
do
think
miss
kathleen
can
come
down
now
eliza
we
have
just
had
a
very
strange
telegram
which
has
rather
upset
yes
the
new
cook
sat
down
to
peel
potatoes
and
study
the
mechanics
of
kitchencraft
she
found
much
to
baffle
her
in
the
array
of
pots
and
pans
and
in
the
workings
of
the
range
from
a
cupboard
she
took
out
choppers
potato
mashers
cream
whippers
and
other
utensils
gazing
at
them
in
total
ignorance
of
their
functions
kent
had
indicated
jugged
hare
and
mashed
potatoes
for
lunch
and
after
some
scrutiny
of
the
problem
eliza
found
a
hammer
in
the
cabinet
with
which
she
began
to
belabour
the
vegetables
mary
who
might
have
suggested
boiling
the
potatoes
first
was
then
upstairs
by
and
by
kathleen
heard
the
thumping
and
came
into
the
kitchen
to
investigate
good
morning
good
morning
miss
said
the
delighted
cook
oh
i
so
happy
to
see
you
miss
thank
you
eliza
did
you
have
a
message
for
me
from
ethel
yes
miss
er
ethel
said
she
hoped
you
give
me
all
the
help
you
can
miss
because
er
you
see
miss
cooking
for
a
private
family
is
very
different
from
working
in
a
college
where
there
are
so
many
i
see
well
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
to
those
potatoes
eliza
mashing
what
with
a
i
washed
the
surely
you
did
mash
them
that
way
at
maggie
hall
eliza
yes
miss
the
young
ladies
got
so
they
could
abide
them
done
any
other
kathleen
looked
more
closely
and
examined
the
badly
bruised
tubers
good
gracious
she
exclaimed
with
a
ripple
of
laughter
they
been
cooked
yet
eliza
was
rather
taken
aback
well
you
see
miss
she
said
at
the
college
we
used
nothing
but
fireless
cookers
and
i
do
understand
these
stoves
very
well
i
wanted
to
get
you
to
explain
it
to
it
perfectly
simple
said
kathleen
this
is
the
oven
and
when
you
want
to
bake
anything
she
cried
opening
the
oven
door
what
you
got
in
here
she
took
a
cloth
and
lifted
out
of
the
oven
a
tall
china
pitcher
with
a
object
protruding
from
it
eliza
was
panic
stricken
and
for
an
instant
forgot
her
role
my
god
i
put
the
hare
in
there
and
forgot
all
about
it
what
a
bally
sell
kathleen
removed
the
hideous
thing
hardly
knowing
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
look
here
eliza
she
said
they
may
jug
hares
that
way
at
maggie
hall
but
i
doubt
it
now
what
you
cook
we
got
guests
coming
a
gentleman
from
america
is
going
to
be
here
and
we
must
put
our
best
foot
eliza
face
was
a
study
in
painful
emotion
excuse
me
miss
she
said
but
is
that
american
gentleman
called
blair
yes
said
kathleen
really
eliza
you
are
most
extraordinary
how
did
you
know
i
heard
of
him
said
eliza
i
think
i
ought
to
warn
you
against
him
miss
he
he
a
nonsense
eliza
what
notions
you
do
have
he
an
antiquarian
and
he
coming
to
see
my
father
about
archaeology
he
a
friend
of
miss
josephine
from
oxford
now
i
think
you
better
get
on
with
your
cooking
and
not
worry
about
miss
kathleen
said
eliza
i
think
i
better
be
frank
with
you
i
want
to
tell
you
here
mary
came
into
the
kitchen
and
although
eliza
thick
made
frantic
gestures
to
her
to
keep
away
the
housemaid
was
too
dense
to
understand
the
opportunity
for
confession
was
lost
now
eliza
said
kathleen
mary
will
help
you
in
anything
you
not
certain
about
i
come
down
again
later
to
see
how
you
getting
by
supper
time
that
night
eliza
thick
began
to
think
that
perhaps
she
had
made
a
tactical
error
by
interning
herself
in
the
kitchen
where
there
was
but
small
opportunity
for
a
with
the
bewitching
kathleen
the
news
that
blair
was
coming
to
the
evening
meal
was
highly
disconcerting
and
the
worried
cook
even
contemplated
the
possibility
of
doctoring
the
american
plate
of
soup
with
ratsbane
or
hemlock
once
during
the
afternoon
she
ventured
a
sally
upstairs
carrying
a
scuttle
of
coal
as
a
pretext
in
the
vague
hope
of
finding
kathleen
somewhere
about
the
house
unfortunately
she
met
kent
on
the
stairs
who
promptly
ordered
her
back
to
her
proper
domain
here
eliza
found
a
person
trying
to
cozen
mary
into
admitting
him
to
the
house
he
claimed
to
be
an
agent
of
the
gas
company
in
search
of
a
rumoured
leak
eliza
immediately
spotted
priapus
and
indignantly
ejected
him
by
force
of
arms
in
the
scuffle
a
dish
pan
and
several
chairs
were
overturned
mary
whose
nerves
were
rather
unstrung
by
the
sustained
comedy
she
was
witnessing
uttered
an
obbligato
of
piercing
yelps
which
soon
brought
kathleen
to
the
scene
eliza
received
a
severe
rating
and
so
admired
the
angry
sparkle
in
kathleen
eyes
that
she
could
hardly
retort
one
other
thing
eliza
said
kathleen
in
conclusion
there
are
to
be
two
guests
at
supper
carter
a
curate
from
oxford
is
coming
too
please
allow
for
him
in
your
if
you
please
miss
cried
the
cook
is
that
stephen
carter
i
believe
it
is
said
kathleen
but
what
of
it
is
he
a
counterfeiter
too
miss
kathleen
i
know
you
think
it
strange
but
i
must
warn
you
against
that
curate
dear
miss
kathleen
he
is
dangerous
he
is
not
what
he
eliza
you
forget
yourself
said
kathleen
severely
mr
carter
comes
with
an
introduction
from
the
bishop
of
oxford
i
hope
that
is
satisfactory
to
you
in
any
case
we
do
not
need
your
approval
for
our
list
of
guests
kent
wants
you
to
take
great
care
with
the
stuffed
eggs
those
mashed
potatoes
made
her
quite
please
miss
i
dreadful
worried
about
those
eggs
the
book
says
to
make
a
nest
for
and
truly
i
do
know
how
to
go
about
it
the
young
ladies
at
college
never
ate
their
eggs
in
nests
miss
and
when
i
gets
nervous
i
ca
do
myself
justice
miss
i
never
can
remember
which
is
the
yolks
and
which
is
the
whites
now
that
will
do
eliza
said
kathleen
you
are
a
very
eccentric
creature
but
i
do
think
you
are
as
stupid
as
all
that
what
do
you
want
do
you
expect
me
to
come
down
here
and
oversee
all
your
preparations
oh
if
you
only
would
miss
it
would
be
gratifying
kathleen
laughed
a
girlish
bubbling
of
pure
mirth
which
was
dreadful
torment
to
the
jealous
masquerader
she
departed
leaving
the
cook
a
prey
to
savage
resolve
well
thought
eliza
if
the
supper
is
bad
enough
i
guess
she
just
to
come
down
and
help
me
thank
goodness
blair
and
carter
are
coming
they
cut
each
throats
and
perhaps
the
stuffed
eggs
will
win
after
all
as
for
that
he
wo
get
into
this
house
unless
it
over
my
dead
body
xii
it
was
a
feverish
and
excited
eliza
that
kathleen
found
in
the
kitchen
when
she
tripped
downstairs
after
the
soup
course
on
a
large
platter
the
cook
had
built
a
kind
of
untidy
thicket
of
parsley
and
chopped
celery
eked
out
with
lettuce
leaves
ambushed
in
this
were
lurking
a
number
of
very
pallid
and
eggs
with
a
nondescript
stuffing
bulging
out
of
them
i
forgot
to
measure
the
yolks
miss
wailed
eliza
that
why
the
stuffing
do
fit
shall
i
throw
a
dash
of
rum
on
board
to
stiffen
up
in
spite
of
her
vexation
kathleen
could
not
help
laughing
no
no
she
said
we
tidy
up
the
nest
a
bit
and
send
them
that
grand
said
eliza
watching
kathleen
quick
fingers
is
a
beautiful
comely
hand
you
have
miss
one
that
it
a
pleasure
to
now
eliza
said
kathleen
you
must
not
shout
up
the
dumb
waiter
so
i
distinctly
heard
you
cry
out
plate
for
the
as
you
sent
up
one
of
the
dishes
of
if
you
please
miss
said
eliza
that
was
because
it
was
the
plate
i
spilled
a
spoonful
of
pepper
into
and
i
thought
it
had
better
go
to
the
cloth
than
anywhere
else
miss
kathleen
i
have
something
very
urgent
to
say
to
you
before
them
two
counterfeiters
upstairs
commit
any
affidavits
or
sworn
you
dish
out
the
eggs
eliza
said
kathleen
and
i
send
them
up
the
dumb
waiter
quick
now
and
where
your
dessert
is
it
ready
all
doing
finely
miss
answered
eliza
but
as
she
opened
the
oven
door
her
assurance
collapsed
she
drew
out
a
cottage
pudding
blackened
and
burnt
to
carbon
a
great
success
said
the
bogus
cook
but
holding
it
on
the
other
side
of
her
apron
so
that
kathleen
could
not
see
here
i
just
shoot
it
up
the
shaft
myself
before
it
gets
she
hurried
into
the
pantry
whisked
it
into
the
dumb
waiter
before
kathleen
could
catch
a
glimpse
and
sent
it
flying
aloft
that
smelt
a
little
burnt
cook
said
kathleen
just
a
wee
bit
crisp
on
one
side
kathleen
was
in
the
pantry
with
her
nose
up
the
shaft
sniffing
the
trail
of
the
cottage
pudding
and
wondering
whether
she
ought
to
recall
it
for
inspection
when
eliza
turning
toward
the
back
door
saw
the
on
the
threshold
the
cook
mind
moved
rapidly
in
this
emergency
she
knew
that
if
priapus
found
himself
face
to
face
with
kathleen
dangerous
exposures
would
follow
at
once
mary
she
whispered
to
the
maid
who
had
just
come
down
from
upstairs
run
tell
the
mistress
the
is
here
again
i
send
him
down
the
and
while
kathleen
was
still
in
the
pantry
and
before
the
pseudo
could
demur
eliza
seized
him
by
the
coat
and
hurried
him
across
the
kitchen
to
the
cellar
door
she
opened
this
and
pointed
downstairs
the
bewildered
disappeared
down
the
steps
and
eliza
closed
the
door
and
turned
the
key
now
miss
said
eliza
i
have
something
very
serious
to
say
to
you
just
at
that
moment
she
saw
the
clerical
black
of
the
reverend
carter
coming
down
the
kitchen
stairs
and
that
is
we
best
get
this
fruit
up
without
delay
and
seizing
a
large
bowl
of
apples
oranges
and
bananas
she
passed
it
to
kathleen
and
backed
her
into
the
pantry
again
kathleen
unsuspectingly
pushed
the
fruit
up
the
dumb
waiter
and
meanwhile
it
took
no
more
than
an
instant
for
eliza
to
take
the
curate
by
the
arm
motion
him
to
silence
and
push
him
toward
the
cellar
door
he
down
there
she
whispered
and
carter
innocently
followed
his
fellow
scorpion
again
eliza
closed
the
door
and
turned
the
key
well
eliza
said
kathleen
i
do
think
you
much
of
a
cook
but
you
a
willing
miss
kathleen
said
the
cook
who
was
now
more
anxious
than
ever
to
cleanse
her
bosom
of
much
perilous
stuff
are
you
very
down
on
practical
jokes
practical
jokes
why
yes
eliza
i
think
they
are
the
lowest
form
of
humour
good
gracious
i
do
believe
we
forgotten
the
coffee
have
you
got
it
ready
yes
miss
yes
miss
right
here
said
eliza
bustling
to
the
stove
but
do
you
think
miss
that
a
frank
confession
atones
for
a
great
deal
really
eliza
you
are
the
most
priceless
creature
i
do
wonder
joe
was
taken
with
you
hush
there
the
bell
what
do
you
suppose
that
is
they
both
listened
kathleen
at
the
shaft
and
eliza
at
the
kitchen
door
eliza
started
to
say
something
but
kathleen
waved
her
to
be
quiet
a
heavy
step
sounded
on
the
stair
and
the
agitated
mary
appeared
followed
by
a
huge
policeman
eliza
of
course
recognized
the
iron
duke
but
the
and
the
disguise
prevented
the
latter
from
knowing
his
fellow
venturer
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
said
kathleen
please
miss
said
the
your
mother
said
there
a
down
here
and
i
been
sent
by
headquarters
to
take
him
in
charge
i
think
he
a
sneak
there
no
such
person
here
officer
said
kathleen
eliza
still
kept
her
sovereign
wits
about
her
she
advanced
to
the
policeman
and
whispering
mysteriously
he
in
here
took
his
sleeve
and
led
him
to
the
cellar
door
he
down
there
she
repeated
put
the
cuffs
on
him
quick
she
opened
the
door
and
the
doubtful
policeman
hypnotized
by
her
decision
stepped
on
to
the
cellar
stairs
the
door
closed
behind
him
and
again
eliza
turned
the
key
what
does
all
this
mean
demanded
kathleen
angrily
has
everybody
gone
daft
eliza
ever
since
you
came
into
the
house
there
has
been
nothing
but
turmoil
i
wish
you
would
explain
why
have
you
sent
the
policeman
into
the
cellar
there
three
dangerous
counterfeiters
down
there
miss
said
eliza
i
want
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
this
miss
kathleen
before
that
american
gets
down
here
he
bound
to
be
here
soon
he
the
worst
of
the
open
that
door
at
once
said
kathleen
stamping
her
foot
i
know
what
on
earth
you
mean
by
counterfeiters
but
if
there
are
any
down
there
let
have
them
up
and
see
what
they
have
to
the
bell
rang
and
mary
instinctively
hurried
upstairs
at
the
same
moment
blair
ran
down
three
steps
at
a
time
and
bounded
into
the
kitchen
he
started
when
he
saw
eliza
are
you
all
right
miss
kent
he
asked
anxiously
i
been
so
worried
about
you
is
that
still
here
i
think
i
can
smell
gas
escaping
can
i
help
in
any
way
what
you
smell
is
a
burnt
cottage
pudding
replied
kathleen
a
policeman
in
the
cellar
i
wish
you
call
him
up
i
have
a
great
mind
to
ask
him
to
take
eliza
in
charge
i
do
think
she
quite
blair
looked
at
eliza
closely
i
agree
with
you
miss
kathleen
he
said
she
looks
like
a
bad
egg
to
me
a
devilled
egg
in
fact
which
is
the
cellar
door
cook
eliza
saw
her
chance
right
here
sir
she
said
taking
hold
of
the
door
knob
she
swung
the
door
open
looks
very
dark
said
blair
i
ca
quite
see
the
step
where
is
it
eliza
eager
to
add
this
last
specimen
to
her
anthology
in
the
cellar
stepped
forward
to
point
out
the
stairway
with
one
lusty
push
blair
shoved
her
through
the
door
and
banged
it
to
he
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
miss
kent
he
said
i
afraid
you
must
think
us
all
crazy
if
you
will
only
let
me
have
five
minutes
uninterrupted
talk
with
you
i
can
explain
these
absurd
misadventures
please
wo
you
let
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
said
kathleen
i
hungry
i
had
only
a
plate
of
soup
and
that
was
counterfeit
i
think
that
mad
woman
intended
it
for
the
curate
for
whom
she
had
conceived
a
let
go
up
and
sit
in
the
and
i
can
talk
while
you
at
that
moment
kent
voice
sounded
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
kathleen
dear
is
everything
all
right
yes
mother
called
kathleen
in
the
same
silvery
soprano
that
set
blair
heart
dancing
your
father
wants
blair
to
come
up
to
the
and
talk
to
him
he
wants
to
tell
him
about
the
battle
of
xiii
blair
nervously
playing
with
a
key
stood
by
the
fire
in
the
kent
had
excused
herself
and
gone
upstairs
in
the
across
the
hall
he
could
see
kathleen
gleaning
over
the
supper
table
while
the
maid
cleared
away
the
dishes
in
spite
of
his
peevishness
he
smiled
to
see
her
pick
up
one
of
the
stuffed
eggs
on
a
fork
taste
it
and
lay
it
down
with
a
grimace
at
the
other
end
of
the
kent
leaning
on
his
cane
was
rummaging
among
some
books
here
we
are
said
the
antiquarian
hobbling
back
with
several
heavy
tomes
here
is
clarendon
history
now
i
want
to
read
you
what
he
has
to
say
about
that
incident
in
then
i
will
read
you
my
manuscript
notes
to
show
you
how
they
fill
up
the
gaps
kathleen
yes
dad
answered
kathleen
coming
into
the
room
will
you
get
me
my
glasses
dear
yes
indeed
and
she
ran
across
the
room
to
fetch
them
from
the
bookcase
where
he
had
left
them
she
seated
herself
on
the
arm
of
her
father
chair
she
was
a
charming
and
graceful
figure
swinging
the
slender
ankle
that
the
scorpions
afterward
described
with
imaginative
fervour
as
a
psalm
a
and
an
aurora
they
none
of
them
ever
agreed
as
to
the
dress
she
wore
that
evening
but
eliza
thick
who
was
perhaps
the
most
observant
declared
that
it
looked
like
a
chintz
curtain
i
think
it
must
have
had
small
sprigs
of
flowers
printed
on
it
her
eyes
exclaimed
the
were
like
a
twilight
with
only
two
perhaps
he
meant
a
street
with
two
lamps
lighted
oh
i
so
glad
you
going
to
read
your
notes
to
blair
she
said
mischievously
they
are
so
fascinating
and
there
such
a
jolly
lot
of
perhaps
kent
eyes
are
tired
said
blair
hastily
not
a
bit
not
a
bit
said
kent
i
do
often
get
such
a
good
listener
by
the
way
what
happened
to
that
nice
young
curate
i
hope
the
did
injure
him
kathleen
looked
at
blair
with
dancing
eyes
he
had
to
go
declared
blair
he
was
awfully
sorry
he
asked
me
to
make
his
perhaps
the
bishop
sent
for
him
suddenly
said
kathleen
well
resumed
kent
i
shall
begin
with
the
battle
of
naseby
after
that
memorable
struggle
a
portion
of
the
royalist
forces
the
bell
trilled
briskly
oh
dear
me
sighed
poor
kent
looking
up
from
his
papers
the
fates
are
against
us
the
scotch
terrier
had
been
lying
by
the
fire
caressed
by
the
toe
of
kathleen
slipper
as
she
sat
on
the
arm
of
her
father
chair
suddenly
he
jumped
up
wagging
his
tail
and
barked
with
evident
glee
a
tall
girl
a
little
older
than
kathleen
pushed
the
hall
curtains
aside
and
darted
into
the
room
joe
you
darling
cried
kathleen
how
your
leg
what
do
you
mean
asked
joe
which
leg
what
wrong
with
it
well
joe
my
dear
this
is
a
jolly
surprise
said
kent
laying
aside
his
books
we
heard
you
were
laid
up
some
misunderstanding
somewhere
we
got
a
friend
of
yours
here
you
see
blair
wished
he
could
have
sunk
through
the
floor
he
would
have
given
anything
to
be
with
the
other
four
in
the
darkness
of
the
cellar
his
ears
and
cheeks
burned
painfully
how
do
you
do
blair
said
josephine
cordially
there
must
be
some
mistake
i
never
met
blair
my
dear
joe
cried
kathleen
i
do
think
we
have
all
gone
nuts
look
here
she
took
three
sheets
of
paper
from
the
mantelpiece
did
you
or
did
you
not
send
us
those
telegrams
joe
ran
her
eye
over
the
messages
reading
them
aloud
kathleen
kent

of
trinity

wolverhampton
for
historical
study

raised

eyes
and
looked
appraisingly
at

confusion
was
agonizing

down
to
the
terrier
which

standing
affectionately
at
her
feet
well
fred
old
boy
she
said

said
blair
but
i
must
tell
you
i
sent
two
of
those
telegrams
and
i
think
i
can
guess
who
sent
the
other
miss
eliza
thick
you
exclaimed
kent
and
both
girls
in
the
same
breath
yes
kent
i
blush
to
confess
it
but
you
and
your
family
have
been
abominably
hoaxed
and
i
can
see
nothing
for
it
but
to
admit
the
truth
painful
as
it
is
i
prefer
to
tell
you
the
two
girls
settled
themselves
on
the
couch
and
kent
bewildered
sat
upright
in
his
chair
the
dog
satisfied
that
everything
was
serene
jumped
on
the
divan
and
lay
down
between
joe
and
kathleen
the
unhappy
blair
stood
awkwardly
on
the
hearth
rug
last
january
he
began
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
kenneth
forbes
an
undergraduate
of
merton
college
now
studying
the
gas
meter
in
your
cellar
was
in
blackwell
book
shop
in
oxford
browsing
about
lying
on
a
row
of
books
in
a
corner
of
the
shop
he
happened
to
see
a
letter
without
an
envelope
he
picked
it
up
and
glanced
at
it
it
had
evidently
been
dropped
there
by
some
customer
the
address
engraved
on
the
paper
was
bancroft
road
wolverhampton
it
was
dated
last
october
and
the
letter
began
joe
thank
you
so
much
for
the
tie
it
is
pretty
and
i
do
wear
ties
sometimes
so
i
let
the
boys
have
it
in
the
upper
corner
were
four
crosses
and
the
words
are
from
fred
the
letter
was
signed
the
two
girls
looked
at
each
other
it
so
happened
continued
blair
that
the
man
who
found
the
letter
had
promised
to
write
the
very
next
day
the
first
chapter
of
a
serial
story
for
a
little
literary
club
to
which
he
belonged
at
the
time
when
he
found
this
letter
lying
about
the
bookshop
he
was
racking
his
brain
for
a
theme
for
his
opening
chapter
a
great
idea
struck
him
he
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
hurried
back
to
his
room
his
idea
was
to
build
up
a
story
around
the
characters
of
the
letter
he
had
no
idea
whom
it
came
from
or
to
whom
it
was
addressed
the
thought
of
making
these
unknown
persons
of
the
letter
the
figures
of
the
story
appealed
to
him
and
with
an
eager
pen
he
set
down
the
first
chapter
with
as
heroine
and
as
a
faint
line
of
colour
crept
up
kathleen
girlish
cheek
this
idea
which
suggested
itself
to
forbes
when
he
found
the
letter
in
the
bookshop
was
taken
up
enthusiastically
by
the
group
of
undergraduates
composing
the
little
club
the
fabrication
of
the
story
was
the
chief
amusement
of
the
term
it
would
be
unfair
to
me
and
to
the
other
men
not
to
say
frankly
that
the
whim
was
not
taken
up
in
any
malicious
or
underhand
spirit
given
the
idea
as
it
first
came
to
the
man
in
the
bookshop
the
rest
flowed
naturally
out
of
it
urged
by
high
spirits
i
must
tell
you
honestly
that
the
characters
of
that
letter
became
very
real
to
us
we
speculated
endlessly
on
their
personalities
tastes
and
ages
we
all
became
frantic
admirers
of
the
lady
who
had
signed
the
letter
and
considered
ourselves
jealous
rivals
of
the
man
to
whom
as
we
supposed
it
had
been
written
and
when
the
end
of
term
came
the
five
members
who
had
entered
most
completely
into
the
spirit
of
the
game
agreed
to
come
to
wolverhampton
for
the
express
purpose
of
attempting
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
kathleen
who
had
so
engaged
their
really
i
think
this
is
dreadfully
silly
said
kathleen
colouring
joe
are
we
characters
in
a
serial
or
are
we
real
persons
this
confession
is
very
painful
for
me
kent
said
blair
because
things
do
seem
to
have
turned
out
at
all
as
we
thought
and
afraid
we
have
abused
your
hospitality
barbarously
i
can
only
beg
that
you
will
forgive
this
wild
prank
which
was
actuated
by
the
most
innocent
then
do
i
understand
asked
kent
that
your
interest
in
wolverhampton
history
was
merely
simulated
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
my
daughter
you
make
me
very
much
ashamed
sir
but
that
is
the
kent
rose
to
his
feet
leaning
on
his
cane
well
well
he
said
i
have
no
wish
to
seem
crabbed
i
sorry
to
lose
so
excellent
a
listener
i
thought
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
but
when
one
has
a
daughter
one
must
expect
her
to
grow
up
and
become
the
heroine
of
serial
stories
i
trust
that
that
story
is
not
to
be
published
i
can
ask
that
at
least
our
intention
said
blair
was
to
give
the
manuscript
to
miss
kent
as
a
token
of
our
united
well
said
kent
make
my
apologies
to
the
other
conspirators
i
take
it
that
that
dreadful
eliza
thick
was
one
of
them
i
hope
our
cook
will
be
back
upon
my
word
those
stuffed
eggs
were
indescribable
joe
my
dear
suppose
you
let
me
take
you
up
to
see
your
aunt
i
expect
these
people
will
want
to
recriminate
each
other
a
little
and
reach
some
sort
of
joe
and
kent
left
the
room
but
a
moment
later
kent
reappeared
at
the
door
mr
blair
he
said
please
do
think
me
lacking
in
sportsmanship
i
was
young
once
myself
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
i
think
you
all
staged
it
remarkably
well
give
carter
my
compliments
on
that
telegram
from
the
good
heavens
exclaimed
blair
as
kent
vanished
behind
the
curtains
i
forgot
those
fellows
are
still
down
in
the
he
held
out
the
key
i
must
let
them
wait
a
minute
said
kathleen
i
have
no
desire
to
see
that
eliza
thick
again
nor
that
odious
curate
not
even
the
enterprising
for
the
space
of
fifteen
thoughts
or
so
there
was
silence
kathleen
sat
at
one
end
of
the
big
couch
the
firelight
shimmering
round
her
in
a
softening
glow
blair
stood
painfully
at
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
miss
kathleen
he
said
i
want
to
beg
you
on
behalf
of
the
other
fellows
not
to
be
too
severe
with
them
i
guess
i
the
worst
offender
with
my
bogus
telegrams
and
my
deliberate
deception
of
your
father
but
i
ought
to
explain
that
we
all
came
here
with
a
definite
intention
in
mind
the
man
who
was
first
able
to
engage
you
in
friendly
conversation
and
get
you
to
accept
an
invitation
to
come
to
oxford
for
eights
week
was
to
be
the
winner
of
the
i
already
accepted
an
invitation
for
eights
week
she
said
after
a
pause
he
uttered
a
dejected
silence
that
was
a
classic
of
its
kind
a
marvel
of
accurate
registration
kathleen
looked
up
at
him
for
the
first
time
since
his
confession
of
the
hoax
their
eyes
met
is
it
carter
he
asked
woefully
i
promised
to
go
and
stay
with
joe
at
maggie
look
here
he
said
i
expect
to
row
in
the
trinity
boat
will
you
and
your
mother
and
and
miss
joe
watch
the
racing
from
our
barge
one
afternoon
anyway
then
you
could
come
to
tea
in
my
rooms
afterward
and
i
ask
the
other
fellows
in
to
meet
the
parson
and
the
policeman
and
the
and
and
eliza
thick
yes
they
all
splendid
chaps
i
know
you
like
well
she
murmured
i
dare
say
eliza
thick
would
be
all
right
in
his
proper
costume
i
shall
never
forget
his
genius
now
i
understand
what
he
meant
by
all
that
talk
about
you
will
come
to
the
trinity
barge
he
begged
there
was
a
pause
a
dropping
coal
clicked
in
the
grate
and
small
slipper
tapped
on
the
fender
i
should
think
she
said
that
a
man
as
persistent
as
you
would
make
a
good
oar
i
glad
the
others
are
americans
too
it
was
bad
enough
as
it
was
miss
kathleen
he
pleaded
i
guess
i
ca
make
you
understand
what
i
like
to
but
if
you
just
come
punting
up
the
cher
on
sunday
in
eights
week
there
are
so
many
things
i
like
to
tell
yes
i
always
wanted
to
hear
about
america
and
the
difference
between
a
republican
and
a
and
you
come
kathleen
rose
laughing
i
have
already
accepted
joe
invitation
she
said
she
gave
him
her
hand
he
held
it
as
long
as
he
dared
looking
her
straight
in
the
eye
not
nearly
as
jealous
of
joe
as
i
was
she
was
gone
through
the
curtains
a
flash
of
dainty
grace
then
her
face
reappeared
if
you
care
to
call
again
some
time
dad
would
love
to
read
you
those
notes
on
the
battle
of
wolverhampton
blair
looked
round
the
room
the
dog
lying
by
the
fire
got
up
stretched
and
wagged
his
tail
blair
pulled
out
his
watch
giminy
he
said
i
better
go
down
and
let
those
poor
devils
out
of
the
the
end
