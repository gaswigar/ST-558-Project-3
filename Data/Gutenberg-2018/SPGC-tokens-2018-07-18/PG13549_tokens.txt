the
art
of
war
by
baron
de
jomini
general
and
of
the
emperor
of
russia
a
new
edition
with
appendices
and
maps
translated
from
the
french
by

army
and

of

army
originally
published
in
preface
in
the
execution
of
any
undertaking
there
are
extremes
on
either
hand
which
are
alike
to
be
avoided
the
rule
holds
in
a
special
manner
in
making
a
translation
there
is
on
the
one
side
the
extreme
of
too
rigid
adherence
word
for
word
and
line
for
line
to
the
original
and
on
the
other
is
the
danger
of
using
too
free
a
pen
in
either
case
the
sense
of
the
author
may
not
be
truly
given
it
is
not
always
easy
to
preserve
a
proper
mean
between
these
extremes
the
translators
of
jomini
summary
of
the
principles
of
the
art
of
war
have
endeavored
to
render
their
author
into
plain
english
without
mutilating
or
adding
to
his
ideas
attempting
no
display
and
making
no
criticisms
to
persons
accustomed
to
read
for
instruction
in
military
matters
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
a
word
with
reference
to
the
merits
of
jomini
to
those
not
thus
accustomed
heretofore
but
who
are
becoming
more
interested
in
such
subjects
and
this
class
must
include
the
great
mass
of
the
american
public
it
is
sufficient
to
say
and
it
may
be
said
with
entire
truth
that
general
jomini
is
admitted
by
all
competent
judges
to
be
one
of
the
ablest
military
critics
and
historians
of
this
or
any
other
day
the
translation
now
presented
to
the
people
has
been
made
with
the
earnest
hope
and
the
sincere
expectation
of
its
proving
useful
as
the
existence
of
a
large
standing
army
is
deemed
incompatible
with
our
institutions
it
becomes
the
more
important
that
military
information
be
as
extensively
diffused
as
possible
among
the
people
if
by
the
present
work
the
translators
shall
find
they
have
contributed
even
in
an
inconsiderable
degree
to
this
important
object
they
will
be
amply
repaid
for
the
care
and
labor
expended
upon
it
to
those
persons
to
whom
the
study
of
the
art
of
war
is
a
new
one
it
is
recommended
to
begin
at
the
article
strategy
chapter
from
that
point
to
read
to
the
end
of
the
second
appendix
and
then
to
return
to
chapters
and
ii
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
subject
to
be
appreciated
must
be
studied
map
in
hand
this
remark
is
especially
true
of
strategy
an
acquaintance
with
the
campaigns
of
napoleon
is
quite
important
as
they
are
constantly
referred
to
by
jomini

summary
of
the
art
of
war
definition
of
the
art
of
war
the
art
of
war
as
generally
considered
consists
of
five
purely
military
branches
viz
strategy
grand
tactics
logistics
engineering
and
tactics
a
sixth
and
essential
branch
hitherto
unrecognized
might
be
termed
in
its
relation
to
although
this
branch
is
more
naturally
and
intimately
connected
with
the
profession
of
a
statesman
than
with
that
of
a
soldier
it
can
not
be
denied
that
if
it
be
useless
to
a
subordinate
general
it
is
indispensable
to
every
general
commanding
an
army
it
enters
into
all
the
combinations
which
may
lead
to
a
war
and
has
a
connection
with
the
various
operations
to
be
undertaken
in
this
war
and
in
this
view
it
should
have
a
place
in
a
work
like
this
to
recapitulate
the
art
of
war
consists
of
six
distinct
parts
statesmanship
in
its
relation
to
war
strategy
or
the
art
of
properly
directing
masses
upon
the
theater
of
war
either
for
defense
or
for
invasion
grand
tactics
logistics
or
the
art
of
moving
armies
engineering
the
attack
and
defense
of
fortifications
minor
tactics
it
is
proposed
to
analyze
the
principal
combinations
of
the
first
four
branches
omitting
the
consideration
of
tactics
and
of
the
art
of
engineering
familiarity
with
all
these
parts
is
not
essential
in
order
to
be
a
good
infantry
cavalry
or
artillery
officer
but
for
a
general
or
for
a
staff
officer
this
knowledge
is
indispensable
chapter
statesmanship
in
its
relation
to
war
under
this
head
are
included
those
considerations
from
which
a
statesman
concludes
whether
a
war
is
proper
opportune
or
indispensable
and
determines
the
various
operations
necessary
to
attain
the
object
of
the
war
a
government
goes
to
war
to
reclaim
certain
rights
or
to
defend
them
to
protect
and
maintain
the
great
interests
of
the
state
as
commerce
manufactures
or
agriculture
to
uphold
neighboring
states
whose
existence
is
necessary
either
for
the
safety
of
the
government
or
the
balance
of
power
to
fulfill
the
obligations
of
offensive
and
defensive
alliances
to
propagate
political
or
religious
theories
to
crush
them
out
or
to
defend
them
to
increase
the
influence
and
power
of
the
state
by
acquisitions
of
territory
to
defend
the
threatened
independence
of
the
state
to
avenge
insulted
honor
or
from
a
mania
for
conquest
it
may
be
remarked
that
these
different
kinds
of
war
influence
in
some
degree
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
efforts
and
operations
necessary
for
the
proposed
end
the
party
who
has
provoked
the
war
may
be
reduced
to
the
defensive
and
the
party
assailed
may
assume
the
offensive
and
there
may
be
other
circumstances
which
will
affect
the
nature
and
conduct
of
a
war
as
a
state
may
simply
make
war
against
another
state
a
state
may
make
war
against
several
states
in
alliance
with
each
other
a
state
in
alliance
with
another
may
make
war
upon
a
single
enemy
a
state
may
be
either
the
principal
party
or
an
auxiliary
in
the
latter
case
a
state
may
join
in
the
struggle
at
its
beginning
or
after
it
has
commenced
the
theater
of
war
may
be
upon
the
soil
of
the
enemy
upon
that
of
an
ally
or
upon
its
own
if
the
war
be
one
of
invasion
it
may
be
upon
adjacent
or
distant
territory
it
may
be
prudent
and
cautious
or
it
may
be
bold
and
adventurous
it
may
be
a
national
war
either
against
ourselves
or
against
the
enemy
the
war
may
be
a
civil
or
a
religious
war
war
is
always
to
be
conducted
according
to
the
great
principles
of
the
art
but
great
discretion
must
be
exercised
in
the
nature
of
the
operations
to
be
undertaken
which
should
depend
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
case
for
example
two
hundred
thousand
french
wishing
to
subjugate
the
spanish
people
united
to
a
man
against
them
would
not
maneuver
as
the
same
number
of
french
in
a
march
upon
vienna
or
any
other
capital
to
compel
a
peace
nor
would
a
french
army
fight
the
guerrillas
of
mina
as
they
fought
the
russians
at
borodino
nor
would
a
french
army
venture
to
march
upon
vienna
without
considering
what
might
be
the
tone
and
temper
of
the
governments
and
communities
between
the
rhine
and
the
inn
or
between
the
danube
and
the
elbe
a
regiment
should
always
fight
in
nearly
the
same
way
but
commanding
generals
must
be
guided
by
circumstances
and
events
to
these
different
combinations
which
belong
more
or
less
to
statesmanship
may
be
added
others
which
relate
solely
to
the
management
of
armies
the
name
military
policy
is
given
to
them
for
they
belong
exclusively
neither
to
diplomacy
nor
to
strategy
but
are
still
of
the
highest
importance
in
the
plans
both
of
a
statesman
and
a
general
article
i
offensive
wars
to
reclaim
rights
when
a
state
has
claims
upon
another
it
may
not
always
be
best
to
enforce
them
by
arms
the
public
interest
must
be
consulted
before
action
the
most
just
war
is
one
which
is
founded
upon
undoubted
rights
and
which
in
addition
promises
to
the
state
advantages
commensurate
with
the
sacrifices
required
and
the
hazards
incurred
unfortunately
in
our
times
there
are
so
many
doubtful
and
contested
rights
that
most
wars
though
apparently
based
upon
bequests
or
wills
or
marriages
are
in
reality
but
wars
of
expediency
the
question
of
the
succession
to
the
spanish
crown
under
louis
xiv
was
very
clear
since
it
was
plainly
settled
by
a
solemn
will
and
was
supported
by
family
ties
and
by
the
general
consent
of
the
spanish
nation
yet
it
was
stoutly
contested
by
all
europe
and
produced
a
general
coalition
against
the
legitimate
legatee
frederick
while
austria
and
france
were
at
war
brought
forward
an
old
claim
entered
silesia
in
force
and
seized
this
province
thus
doubling
the
power
of
prussia
this
was
a
stroke
of
genius
and
even
if
he
had
failed
he
could
not
have
been
much
censured
for
the
grandeur
and
importance
of
the
enterprise
justified
him
in
his
attempt
as
far
as
such
attempts
can
be
justified
in
wars
of
this
nature
no
rules
can
be
laid
down
to
watch
and
to
profit
by
every
circumstance
covers
all
that
can
be
said
offensive
movements
should
be
suitable
to
the
end
to
be
attained
the
most
natural
step
would
be
to
occupy
the
disputed
territory
then
offensive
operations
may
be
carried
on
according
to
circumstances
and
to
the
respective
strength
of
the
parties
the
object
being
to
secure
the
cession
of
the
territory
by
the
enemy
and
the
means
being
to
threaten
him
in
the
heart
of
his
own
country
every
thing
depends
upon
the
alliances
the
parties
may
be
able
to
secure
with
other
states
and
upon
their
military
resources
in
an
offensive
movement
scrupulous
care
must
be
exercised
not
to
arouse
the
jealousy
of
any
other
state
which
might
come
to
the
aid
of
the
enemy
it
is
a
part
of
the
duty
of
a
statesman
to
foresee
this
chance
and
to
obviate
it
by
making
proper
explanations
and
giving
proper
guarantees
to
other
states
article
ii
of
wars
defensive
politically
and
offensive
in
a
military
point
of
view
a
state
attacked
by
another
which
renews
an
old
claim
rarely
yields
it
without
a
war
it
prefers
to
defend
its
territory
as
is
always
more
honorable
but
it
may
be
advantageous
to
take
the
offensive
instead
of
awaiting
the
attack
on
the
frontiers
there
are
often
advantages
in
a
war
of
invasion
there
are
also
advantages
in
awaiting
the
enemy
upon
one
own
soil
a
power
with
no
internal
dissensions
and
under
no
apprehension
of
an
attack
by
a
third
party
will
always
find
it
advantageous
to
carry
the
war
upon
hostile
soil
this
course
will
spare
its
territory
from
devastation
carry
on
the
war
at
the
expense
of
the
enemy
excite
the
ardor
of
its
soldiers
and
depress
the
spirits
of
the
adversary
nevertheless
in
a
purely
military
sense
it
is
certain
that
an
army
operating
in
its
own
territory
upon
a
theater
of
which
all
the
natural
and
artificial
features
are
well
known
where
all
movements
are
aided
by
a
knowledge
of
the
country
by
the
favor
of
the
citizens
and
the
aid
of
the
constituted
authorities
possesses
great
advantages
these
plain
truths
have
their
application
in
all
descriptions
of
war
but
if
the
principles
of
strategy
are
always
the
same
it
is
different
with
the
political
part
of
war
which
is
modified
by
the
tone
of
communities
by
localities
and
by
the
characters
of
men
at
the
head
of
states
and
armies
the
fact
of
these
modifications
has
been
used
to
prove
that
war
knows
no
rules
military
science
rests
upon
principles
which
can
never
be
safely
violated
in
the
presence
of
an
active
and
skillful
enemy
while
the
moral
and
political
part
of
war
presents
these
variations
plans
of
operations
are
made
as
circumstances
may
demand
to
execute
these
plans
the
great
principles
of
war
must
be
observed
for
instance
the
plan
of
a
war
against
france
austria
or
russia
would
differ
widely
from
one
against
the
brave
but
undisciplined
bands
of
turks
which
can
not
be
kept
in
order
are
not
able
to
maneuver
well
and
possess
no
steadiness
under
misfortunes
article
iii
wars
of
expediency
the
invasion
of
silesia
by
frederick
and
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
were
wars
of
expediency
there
are
two
kinds
of
wars
of
expediency
first
where
a
powerful
state
undertakes
to
acquire
natural
boundaries
for
commercial
and
political
reasons
secondly
to
lessen
the
power
of
a
dangerous
rival
or
to
prevent
his
aggrandizement
these
last
are
wars
of
intervention
for
a
state
will
rarely
singly
attack
a
dangerous
rival
it
will
endeavor
to
form
a
coalition
for
that
purpose
these
views
belong
rather
to
statesmanship
or
diplomacy
than
to
war
article
iv
of
wars
with
or
without
allies
of
course
in
a
war
an
ally
is
to
be
desired
all
other
things
being
equal
although
a
great
state
will
more
probably
succeed
than
two
weaker
states
in
alliance
against
it
still
the
alliance
is
stronger
than
either
separately
the
ally
not
only
furnishes
a
contingent
of
troops
but
in
addition
annoys
the
enemy
to
a
great
degree
by
threatening
portions
of
his
frontier
which
otherwise
would
have
been
secure
all
history
teaches
that
no
enemy
is
so
insignificant
as
to
be
despised
and
neglected
by
any
power
however
formidable
article
wars
of
intervention
to
interfere
in
a
contest
already
begun
promises
more
advantages
to
a
state
than
war
under
any
other
circumstances
and
the
reason
is
plain
the
power
which
interferes
throws
upon
one
side
of
the
scale
its
whole
weight
and
influence
it
interferes
at
the
most
opportune
moment
when
it
can
make
decisive
use
of
its
resources
there
are
two
kinds
of
intervention
intervention
in
the
internal
affairs
of
neighboring
states
intervention
in
external
relations
whatever
may
be
said
as
to
the
moral
character
of
interventions
of
the
first
class
instances
are
frequent
the
romans
acquired
power
by
these
interferences
and
the
empire
of
the
english
india
company
was
assured
in
a
similar
manner
these
interventions
are
not
always
successful
while
russia
has
added
to
her
power
by
interference
with
poland
austria
on
the
contrary
was
almost
ruined
by
her
attempt
to
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
france
during
the
revolution
intervention
in
the
external
relations
of
states
is
more
legitimate
and
perhaps
more
advantageous
it
may
be
doubtful
whether
a
nation
has
the
right
to
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
another
people
but
it
certainly
has
a
right
to
oppose
it
when
it
propagates
disorder
which
may
reach
the
adjoining
states
there
are
three
reasons
for
intervention
in
exterior
foreign
wars
viz
by
virtue
of
a
treaty
which
binds
to
aid
to
maintain
the
political
equilibrium
to
avoid
certain
evil
consequences
of
the
war
already
commenced
or
to
secure
certain
advantages
from
the
war
not
to
be
obtained
otherwise
history
is
filled
with
examples
of
powers
which
have
fallen
by
neglect
of
these
principles
a
state
begins
to
decline
when
it
permits
the
immoderate
aggrandizement
of
a
rival
and
a
secondary
power
may
become
the
arbiter
of
nations
if
it
throw
its
weight
into
the
balance
at
the
proper
time
in
a
military
view
it
seems
plain
that
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
new
and
large
army
as
a
third
party
in
a
war
must
be
decisive
much
will
depend
upon
its
geographical
position
in
reference
to
the
armies
already
in
the
field
for
example
in
the
winter
of
napoleon
crossed
the
vistula
and
ventured
to
the
walls
of
königsberg
leaving
austria
on
his
rear
and
having
russia
in
front
if
austria
had
launched
an
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
from
bohemia
upon
the
oder
it
is
probable
that
the
power
of
napoleon
would
have
been
ended
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
his
army
could
not
have
regained
the
rhine
austria
preferred
to
wait
till
she
could
raise
four
hundred
thousand
men
two
years
afterward
with
this
force
she
took
the
field
and
was
beaten
while
one
hundred
thousand
men
well
employed
at
the
proper
time
would
have
decided
the
fate
of
europe
there
are
several
kinds
of
war
resulting
from
these
two
different
interventions
where
the
intervention
is
merely
auxiliary
and
with
a
force
specified
by
former
treaties
where
the
intervention
is
to
uphold
a
feeble
neighbor
by
defending
his
territory
thus
shifting
the
scene
of
war
to
other
soil
a
state
interferes
as
a
principal
party
when
near
the
theater
of
war
which
supposes
the
case
of
a
coalition
of
several
powers
against
one
a
state
interferes
either
in
a
struggle
already
in
progress
or
interferes
before
the
declaration
of
war
when
a
state
intervenes
with
only
a
small
contingent
in
obedience
to
it
is
simply
an
accessory
and
has
but
little
voice
in
the
main
operations
but
when
it
intervenes
as
a
principal
party
and
with
an
imposing
force
the
case
is
quite
different
the
military
chances
in
these
wars
are
varied
the
russian
army
in
the
seven
years
war
was
in
fact
auxiliary
to
that
of
austria
and
france
still
it
was
a
principal
party
in
the
north
until
its
occupation
of
prussia
but
when
generals
fermor
and
soltikoff
conducted
the
army
as
far
as
brandenburg
it
acted
solely
in
the
interest
of
austria
the
fate
of
these
troops
far
from
their
base
depended
upon
the
good
or
bad
maneuvering
of
their
allies
such
distant
excursions
are
dangerous
and
generally
delicate
operations
the
campaigns
of
and
furnish
sad
illustrations
of
this
to
which
we
shall
again
refer
in
article
in
discussing
the
military
character
of
these
expeditions
it
follows
then
that
the
safety
of
the
army
may
be
endangered
by
these
distant
interventions
the
counterbalancing
advantage
is
that
its
own
territory
can
not
then
be
easily
invaded
since
the
scene
of
hostilities
is
so
distant
so
that
what
may
be
a
misfortune
for
the
general
may
be
in
a
measure
an
advantage
to
the
state
in
wars
of
this
character
the
essentials
are
to
secure
a
general
who
is
both
a
statesman
and
a
soldier
to
have
clear
stipulations
with
the
allies
as
to
the
part
to
be
taken
by
each
in
the
principal
operations
finally
to
agree
upon
an
objective
point
which
shall
be
in
harmony
with
the
common
interests
by
the
neglect
of
these
precautions
the
greater
number
of
coalitions
have
failed
or
have
maintained
a
difficult
struggle
with
a
power
more
united
but
weaker
than
the
allies
the
third
kind
of
intervention
which
consists
in
interfering
with
the
whole
force
of
the
state
and
near
to
its
frontiers
is
more
promising
than
the
others
austria
had
an
opportunity
of
this
character
in
but
failed
to
profit
by
it
she
again
had
the
opportunity
in
napoleon
had
just
collected
his
forces
in
saxony
when
austria
taking
his
front
of
operations
in
reverse
threw
herself
into
the
struggle
with
two
hundred
thousand
men
with
almost
perfect
certainty
of
success
she
regained
in
two
months
the
italian
empire
and
her
influence
in
germany
which
had
been
lost
by
fifteen
years
of
disaster
in
this
intervention
austria
had
not
only
the
political
but
also
the
military
chances
in
her
favor
a
double
result
combining
the
highest
advantages
her
success
was
rendered
more
certain
by
the
fact
that
while
the
theater
was
sufficiently
near
her
frontiers
to
permit
the
greatest
possible
display
of
force
she
at
the
same
time
interfered
in
a
contest
already
in
progress
upon
which
she
entered
with
the
whole
of
her
resources
and
at
the
time
most
opportune
for
her
this
double
advantage
is
so
decisive
that
it
permits
not
only
powerful
monarchies
but
even
small
states
to
exercise
a
controlling
influence
when
they
know
how
to
profit
by
it
two
examples
may
establish
this
in
the
elector
maurice
of
saxony
boldly
declared
war
against
charles
who
was
master
of
spain
italy
and
the
german
empire
and
had
been
victorious
over
francis
and
held
france
in
his
grasp
this
movement
carried
the
war
into
the
tyrol
and
arrested
the
great
conqueror
in
his
career
in
the
duke
of
savoy
victor
amadeus
by
declaring
himself
hostile
to
louis
changed
the
state
of
affairs
in
italy
and
caused
the
recall
of
the
french
army
from
the
banks
of
the
adige
to
the
walls
of
turin
where
it
encountered
the
great
catastrophe
which
immortalized
prince
eugene
enough
has
been
said
to
illustrate
the
importance
and
effect
of
these
opportune
interventions
more
illustrations
might
be
given
but
they
could
not
add
to
the
conviction
of
the
reader
article
vi
aggressive
wars
for
conquest
and
other
reasons
there
are
two
very
different
kinds
of
invasion
one
attacks
an
adjoining
state
the
other
attacks
a
distant
point
over
intervening
territory
of
great
extent
whose
inhabitants
may
be
neutral
doubtful
or
hostile
wars
of
conquest
unhappily
are
often
prosperous
as
alexander
cæsar
and
napoleon
during
a
portion
of
his
career
have
fully
proved
however
there
are
natural
limits
in
these
wars
which
can
not
be
passed
without
incurring
great
disaster
cambyses
in
nubia
darius
in
scythia
crassus
and
the
emperor
julian
among
the
parthians
and
napoleon
in
russia
furnish
bloody
proofs
of
these
the
love
of
conquest
however
was
not
the
only
motive
with
napoleon
his
personal
position
and
his
contest
with
england
urged
him
to
enterprises
the
aim
of
which
was
to
make
him
supreme
it
is
true
that
he
loved
war
and
its
chances
but
he
was
also
a
victim
to
the
necessity
of
succeeding
in
his
efforts
or
of
yielding
to
england
it
might
be
said
that
he
was
sent
into
this
world
to
teach
generals
and
statesmen
what
they
should
avoid
his
victories
teach
what
may
be
accomplished
by
activity
boldness
and
skill
his
disasters
what
might
have
been
avoided
by
prudence
a
war
of
invasion
without
good
reason
like
that
of
genghis
khan
is
a
crime
against
humanity
but
it
may
be
excused
if
not
approved
when
induced
by
great
interests
or
when
conducted
with
good
motives
the
invasions
of
spain
of
and
of
differed
equally
in
object
and
in
results
the
first
was
a
cunning
and
wanton
attack
which
threatened
the
existence
of
the
spanish
nation
and
was
fatal
to
its
author
the
second
while
combating
dangerous
principles
fostered
the
general
interests
of
the
country
and
was
the
more
readily
brought
to
a
successful
termination
because
its
object
met
with
the
approval
of
the
majority
of
the
people
whose
territory
was
invaded
these
illustrations
show
that
invasions
are
not
necessarily
all
of
the
same
character
the
first
contributed
largely
to
the
fall
of
napoleon
the
second
restored
the
relation
between
france
and
spain
which
ought
never
to
have
been
changed
let
us
hope
that
invasions
may
be
rare
still
it
is
better
to
attack
than
to
be
invaded
and
let
us
remember
that
the
surest
way
to
check
the
spirit
of
conquest
and
usurpation
is
to
oppose
it
by
intervention
at
the
proper
time
an
invasion
to
be
successful
must
be
proportioned
in
magnitude
to
the
end
to
be
attained
and
to
the
obstacles
to
be
overcome
an
invasion
against
an
exasperated
people
ready
for
all
sacrifices
and
likely
to
be
aided
by
a
powerful
neighbor
is
a
dangerous
enterprise
as
was
well
proved
by
the
war
in
spain
and
by
the
wars
of
the
revolution
in
and
in
these
latter
wars
if
france
was
better
prepared
than
spain
she
had
no
powerful
ally
and
she
was
attacked
by
all
europe
upon
both
land
and
sea
although
the
circumstances
were
different
the
russian
invasion
of
turkey
developed
in
some
respects
the
same
symptoms
of
national
resistance
the
religious
hatred
of
the
ottoman
powerfully
incited
him
to
arms
but
the
same
motive
was
powerless
among
the
greeks
who
were
twice
as
numerous
as
the
turks
had
the
interests
of
the
greeks
and
turks
been
harmonized
as
were
those
of
alsace
with
france
the
united
people
would
have
been
stronger
but
they
would
have
lacked
the
element
of
religious
fanaticism
the
war
of
proved
that
turkey
was
formidable
only
upon
the
frontiers
where
her
bravest
troops
were
found
while
in
the
interior
all
was
weakness
when
an
invasion
of
a
neighboring
territory
has
nothing
to
fear
from
the
inhabitants
the
principles
of
strategy
shape
its
course
the
popular
feeling
rendered
the
invasions
of
italy
austria
and
prussia
so
prompt
these
military
points
are
treated
of
in
article
xxix
but
when
the
invasion
is
distant
and
extensive
territories
intervene
its
success
will
depend
more
upon
diplomacy
than
upon
strategy
the
first
step
to
insure
success
will
be
to
secure
the
sincere
and
devoted
alliance
of
a
state
adjoining
the
enemy
which
will
afford
reinforcements
of
troops
and
what
is
still
more
important
give
a
secure
base
of
operations
depots
of
supplies
and
a
safe
refuge
in
case
of
disaster
the
ally
must
have
the
same
interest
in
success
as
the
invaders
to
render
all
this
possible
diplomacy
while
almost
decisive
in
distant
expeditions
is
not
powerless
in
adjacent
invasions
for
here
a
hostile
intervention
may
arrest
the
most
brilliant
successes
the
invasions
of
austria
in
and
might
have
ended
differently
if
prussia
had
interfered
the
invasion
of
the
north
of
germany
in
was
so
to
speak
permitted
by
austria
that
of
rumelia
in
might
have
ended
in
disaster
had
not
a
wise
statesmanship
by
negotiation
obviated
all
chance
of
intervention
article
vii
wars
of
opinion
although
wars
of
opinion
national
wars
and
civil
wars
are
sometimes
confounded
they
differ
enough
to
require
separate
notice
wars
of
opinion
may
be
intestine
both
intestine
and
foreign
and
lastly
which
however
is
rare
they
may
be
foreign
or
exterior
without
being
intestine
or
civil
wars
of
opinion
between
two
states
belong
also
to
the
class
of
wars
of
intervention
for
they
result
either
from
doctrines
which
one
party
desires
to
propagate
among
its
neighbors
or
from
dogmas
which
it
desires
to
crush
in
both
cases
leading
to
intervention
although
originating
in
religious
or
political
dogmas
these
wars
are
most
deplorable
for
like
national
wars
they
enlist
the
worst
passions
and
become
vindictive
cruel
and
terrible
the
wars
of
islamism
the
crusades
the
thirty
years
war
the
wars
of
the
league
present
nearly
the
same
characteristics
often
religion
is
the
pretext
to
obtain
political
power
and
the
war
is
not
really
one
of
dogmas
the
successors
of
mohammed
cared
more
to
extend
their
empire
than
to
preach
the
koran
and
philip
bigot
as
he
was
did
not
sustain
the
league
in
france
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
the
roman
church
we
agree
with
ancelot
that
louis
when
he
went
on
a
crusade
in
egypt
thought
more
of
the
commerce
of
the
indies
than
of
gaining
possession
of
the
holy
sepulcher
the
dogma
sometimes
is
not
only
a
pretext
but
is
a
powerful
ally
for
it
excites
the
ardor
of
the
people
and
also
creates
a
party
for
instance
the
swedes
in
the
thirty
years
war
and
philip
ii
in
france
had
allies
in
the
country
more
powerful
than
their
armies
it
may
however
happen
as
in
the
crusades
and
the
wars
of
islamism
that
the
dogma
for
which
the
war
is
waged
instead
of
friends
finds
only
bitter
enemies
in
the
country
invaded
and
then
the
contest
becomes
fearful
the
chances
of
support
and
resistance
in
wars
of
political
opinions
are
about
equal
it
may
be
recollected
how
in
associations
of
fanatics
thought
it
possible
to
propagate
throughout
europe
the
famous
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
and
how
governments
became
justly
alarmed
and
rushed
to
arms
probably
with
the
intention
of
only
forcing
the
lava
of
this
volcano
back
into
its
crater
and
there
extinguishing
it
the
means
were
not
fortunate
for
war
and
aggression
are
inappropriate
measures
for
arresting
an
evil
which
lies
wholly
in
the
human
passions
excited
in
a
temporary
paroxysm
of
less
duration
as
it
is
the
more
violent
time
is
the
true
remedy
for
all
bad
passions
and
for
all
anarchical
doctrines
a
civilized
nation
may
bear
the
yoke
of
a
factious
and
unrestrained
multitude
for
a
short
interval
but
these
storms
soon
pass
away
and
reason
resumes
her
sway
to
attempt
to
restrain
such
a
mob
by
a
foreign
force
is
to
attempt
to
restrain
the
explosion
of
a
mine
when
the
powder
has
already
been
ignited
it
is
far
better
to
await
the
explosion
and
afterward
fill
up
the
crater
than
to
try
to
prevent
it
and
to
perish
in
the
attempt
after
a
profound
study
of
the
revolution
i
am
convinced
that
if
the
girondists
and
national
assembly
had
not
been
threatened
by
foreign
armaments
they
would
never
have
dared
to
lay
their
sacrilegious
hands
upon
the
feeble
but
venerable
head
of
louis
xvi
the
girondists
would
never
have
been
crushed
by
the
mountain
but
for
the
reverses
of
dumouriez
and
the
threats
of
invasion
and
if
they
had
been
permitted
to
clash
and
quarrel
with
each
other
to
their
hearts
content
it
is
probable
that
instead
of
giving
place
to
the
terrible
convention
the
assembly
would
slowly
have
returned
to
the
restoration
of
good
temperate
monarchical
doctrines
in
accordance
with
the
necessities
and
the
immemorial
traditions
of
the
french
in
a
military
view
these
wars
are
fearful
since
the
invading
force
not
only
is
met
by
the
armies
of
the
enemy
but
is
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
an
exasperated
people
it
may
be
said
that
the
violence
of
one
party
will
necessarily
create
support
for
the
invaders
by
the
formation
of
another
and
opposite
one
but
if
the
exasperated
party
possesses
all
the
public
resources
the
armies
the
forts
the
arsenals
and
if
it
is
supported
by
a
large
majority
of
the
people
of
what
avail
will
be
the
support
of
the
faction
which
possesses
no
such
means
what
service
did
one
hundred
thousand
vendeans
and
one
hundred
thousand
federalists
do
for
the
coalition
in
history
contains
but
a
single
example
of
a
struggle
like
that
of
the
revolution
and
it
appears
to
clearly
demonstrate
the
danger
of
attacking
an
nation
however
the
bad
management
of
the
military
operations
was
one
cause
of
the
unexpected
result
and
before
deducing
any
certain
maxims
from
this
war
we
should
ascertain
what
would
have
been
the
result
if
after
the
flight
of
dumouriez
instead
of
destroying
and
capturing
fortresses
the
allies
had
informed
the
commanders
of
those
fortresses
that
they
contemplated
no
wrong
to
france
to
her
forts
or
her
brave
armies
and
had
marched
on
paris
with
two
hundred
thousand
men
they
might
have
restored
the
monarchy
and
again
they
might
never
have
returned
at
least
without
the
protection
of
an
equal
force
on
their
retreat
to
the
rhine
it
is
difficult
to
decide
this
since
the
experiment
was
never
made
and
as
all
would
have
depended
upon
the
course
of
the
french
nation
and
the
army
the
problem
thus
presents
two
equally
grave
solutions
the
campaign
of
gave
one
whether
the
other
might
have
been
obtained
it
is
difficult
to
say
experiment
alone
could
have
determined
it
the
military
precepts
for
such
wars
are
nearly
the
same
as
for
national
wars
differing
however
in
a
vital
point
in
national
wars
the
country
should
be
occupied
and
subjugated
the
fortified
places
besieged
and
reduced
and
the
armies
destroyed
whereas
in
wars
of
opinion
it
is
of
less
importance
to
subjugate
the
country
here
great
efforts
should
be
made
to
gain
the
end
speedily
without
delaying
for
details
care
being
constantly
taken
to
avoid
any
acts
which
might
alarm
the
nation
for
its
independence
or
the
integrity
of
its
territory
the
war
in
spain
in
is
an
example
which
may
be
cited
in
favor
of
this
course
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
revolution
it
is
true
that
the
conditions
were
slightly
different
for
the
french
army
of
was
made
up
of
more
solid
elements
than
that
of
the
radicals
of
the
isla
de
leon
the
war
of
the
revolution
was
at
once
a
war
of
opinion
a
national
war
and
a
civil
war
while
if
the
first
war
in
spain
in
was
thoroughly
a
national
war
that
of
was
a
partial
struggle
of
opinions
without
the
element
of
nationality
and
hence
the
enormous
difference
in
the
results
moreover
the
expedition
of
the
duke
of
angoulême
was
well
carried
out
instead
of
attacking
fortresses
he
acted
in
conformity
to
the
precepts
pushing
on
rapidly
to
the
ebro
he
there
divided
his
forces
to
seize
at
their
sources
all
the
elements
of
strength
of
their
enemies
which
they
could
safely
do
since
they
were
sustained
by
a
majority
of
the
inhabitants
if
he
had
followed
the
instructions
of
the
ministry
to
proceed
methodically
to
the
conquest
of
the
country
and
the
reduction
of
the
fortresses
between
the
pyrenees
and
the
ebro
in
order
to
provide
a
base
of
operations
he
would
perhaps
have
failed
in
his
mission
or
at
least
made
the
war
a
long
and
bloody
one
by
exciting
the
national
spirit
by
an
occupation
of
the
country
similar
to
that
of
emboldened
by
the
hearty
welcome
of
the
people
he
comprehended
that
it
was
a
political
operation
rather
than
a
military
one
and
that
it
behooved
him
to
consummate
it
rapidly
his
conduct
so
different
from
that
of
the
allies
in
deserves
careful
attention
from
all
charged
with
similar
missions
in
three
months
the
army
was
under
the
walls
of
cadiz
if
the
events
now
transpiring
in
the
peninsula
prove
that
statesmanship
was
not
able
to
profit
by
success
in
order
to
found
a
suitable
and
solid
order
of
things
the
fault
was
neither
in
the
army
nor
in
its
commanders
but
in
the
spanish
government
which
yielding
to
the
counsel
of
violent
reactionaries
was
unable
to
rise
to
the
height
of
its
mission
the
arbiter
between
two
great
hostile
interests
ferdinand
blindly
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
the
party
which
professed
a
deep
veneration
for
the
throne
but
which
intended
to
use
the
royal
authority
for
the
furtherance
of
its
own
ends
regardless
of
consequences
the
nation
remained
divided
in
two
hostile
camps
which
it
would
not
have
been
impossible
to
calm
and
reconcile
in
time
these
camps
came
anew
into
collision
as
i
predicted
in
verona
in
a
striking
lesson
by
which
no
one
is
disposed
to
profit
in
that
beautiful
and
unhappy
land
although
history
is
not
wanting
in
examples
to
prove
that
violent
reactions
any
more
than
revolutions
are
not
elements
with
which
to
construct
and
consolidate
may
god
grant
that
from
this
frightful
conflict
may
emerge
a
strong
and
respected
monarchy
equally
separated
from
all
factions
and
based
upon
a
disciplined
army
as
well
as
upon
the
general
interests
of
the
country
a
monarchy
capable
of
rallying
to
its
support
this
incomprehensible
spanish
nation
which
with
merits
not
less
extraordinary
than
its
faults
was
always
a
problem
for
those
who
were
in
the
best
position
to
know
it
article
viii
national
wars
national
wars
to
which
we
have
referred
in
speaking
of
those
of
invasion
are
the
most
formidable
of
all
this
name
can
only
be
applied
to
such
as
are
waged
against
a
united
people
or
a
great
majority
of
them
filled
with
a
noble
ardor
and
determined
to
sustain
their
independence
then
every
step
is
disputed
the
army
holds
only
its
its
supplies
can
only
be
obtained
at
the
point
of
the
sword
and
its
convoys
are
everywhere
threatened
or
captured
the
spectacle
of
a
spontaneous
uprising
of
a
nation
is
rarely
seen
and
though
there
be
in
it
something
grand
and
noble
which
commands
our
admiration
the
consequences
are
so
terrible
that
for
the
sake
of
humanity
we
ought
to
hope
never
to
see
it
this
uprising
must
not
be
confounded
with
a
national
defense
in
accordance
with
the
institutions
of
the
state
and
directed
by
the
government
this
uprising
may
be
produced
by
the
most
opposite
causes
the
serfs
may
rise
in
a
body
at
the
call
of
the
government
and
their
masters
affected
by
a
noble
love
of
their
sovereign
and
country
may
set
them
the
example
and
take
the
command
of
them
and
similarly
a
fanatical
people
may
arm
under
the
appeal
of
its
priests
or
a
people
enthusiastic
in
its
political
opinions
or
animated
by
a
sacred
love
of
its
institutions
may
rush
to
meet
the
enemy
in
defense
of
all
it
holds
most
dear
the
control
of
the
sea
is
of
much
importance
in
the
results
of
a
national
invasion
if
the
people
possess
a
long
stretch
of
coast
and
are
masters
of
the
sea
or
in
alliance
with
a
power
which
controls
it
their
power
of
resistance
is
quintupled
not
only
on
account
of
the
facility
of
feeding
the
insurrection
and
of
alarming
the
enemy
on
all
the
points
he
may
occupy
but
still
more
by
the
difficulties
which
will
be
thrown
in
the
way
of
his
procuring
supplies
by
the
sea
the
nature
of
the
country
may
be
such
as
to
contribute
to
the
facility
of
a
national
defense
in
mountainous
countries
the
people
are
always
most
formidable
next
to
these
are
countries
covered
with
extensive
forests
the
resistance
of
the
swiss
to
austria
and
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
that
of
the
catalans
in
and
in
the
difficulties
encountered
by
the
russians
in
the
subjugation
of
the
tribes
of
the
caucasus
and
finally
the
reiterated
efforts
of
the
tyrolese
clearly
demonstrate
that
the
inhabitants
of
mountainous
regions
have
always
resisted
for
a
longer
time
than
those
of
the
plains
which
is
due
as
much
to
the
difference
in
character
and
customs
as
to
the
difference
in
the
natural
features
of
the
countries
defiles
and
large
forests
as
well
as
rocky
regions
favor
this
kind
of
defense
and
the
bocage
of
la
vendée
so
justly
celebrated
proves
that
any
country
even
if
it
be
only
traversed
by
large
hedges
and
ditches
or
canals
admits
of
a
formidable
defense
the
difficulties
in
the
path
of
an
army
in
wars
of
opinions
as
well
as
in
national
wars
are
very
great
and
render
the
mission
of
the
general
conducting
them
very
difficult
the
events
just
mentioned
the
contest
of
the
netherlands
with
philip
ii
and
that
of
the
americans
with
the
english
furnish
evident
proofs
of
this
but
the
much
more
extraordinary
struggle
of
la
vendée
with
the
victorious
republic
those
of
spain
portugal
and
the
tyrol
against
napoleon
and
finally
those
of
the
morea
against
the
turks
and
of
navarre
against
the
armies
of
queen
christina
are
still
more
striking
illustrations
the
difficulties
are
particularly
great
when
the
people
are
supported
by
a
considerable
nucleus
of
disciplined
troops
the
invader
has
only
an
army
his
adversaries
have
an
army
and
a
people
wholly
or
almost
wholly
in
arms
and
making
means
of
resistance
out
of
every
thing
each
individual
of
whom
conspires
against
the
common
enemy
even
the
have
an
interest
in
his
ruin
and
accelerate
it
by
every
means
in
their
power
he
holds
scarcely
any
ground
but
that
upon
which
he
encamps
outside
the
limits
of
his
camp
every
thing
is
hostile
and
multiplies
a
thousandfold
the
difficulties
he
meets
at
every
step
these
obstacles
become
almost
insurmountable
when
the
country
is
difficult
each
armed
inhabitant
knows
the
smallest
paths
and
their
connections
he
finds
everywhere
a
relative
or
friend
who
aids
him
the
commanders
also
know
the
country
and
learning
immediately
the
slightest
movement
on
the
part
of
the
invader
can
adopt
the
best
measures
to
defeat
his
projects
while
the
latter
without
information
of
their
movements
and
not
in
a
condition
to
send
out
detachments
to
gain
it
having
no
resource
but
in
his
bayonets
and
certain
safety
only
in
the
concentration
of
his
columns
is
like
a
blind
man
his
combinations
are
failures
and
when
after
the
most
movements
and
the
most
rapid
and
fatiguing
marches
he
thinks
he
is
about
to
accomplish
his
aim
and
deal
a
terrible
blow
he
finds
no
signs
of
the
enemy
but
his
so
that
while
like
don
quixote
he
is
attacking
windmills
his
adversary
is
on
his
line
of
communications
destroys
the
detachments
left
to
guard
it
surprises
his
convoys
his
depots
and
carries
on
a
war
so
disastrous
for
the
invader
that
he
must
inevitably
yield
after
a
time
in
spain
i
was
a
witness
of
two
terrible
examples
of
this
kind
when
ney
corps
replaced
soult
at
corunna
i
had
camped
the
companies
of
the
between
betanzos
and
corunna
in
the
midst
of
four
brigades
distant
from
the
camp
from
two
to
three
leagues
and
no
spanish
forces
had
been
seen
within
fifty
miles
soult
still
occupied
santiago
de
compostela
the
division
was
at
ferrol
and
lugo
marchand
at
corunna
and
betanzos
nevertheless
one
fine
night
the
companies
of
the
train
men
and
horses
disappeared
and
we
were
never
able
to
discover
what
became
of
them
a
solitary
wounded
corporal
escaped
to
report
that
the
peasants
led
by
their
monks
and
priests
had
thus
made
away
with
them
four
months
afterward
ney
with
a
single
division
marched
to
conquer
the
asturias
descending
the
valley
of
the
navia
while
kellermann
debouched
from
leon
by
the
oviedo
road
a
part
of
the
corps
of
la
romana
which
was
guarding
the
asturias
marched
behind
the
very
heights
which
inclose
the
valley
of
the
navia
at
most
but
a
league
from
our
columns
without
the
marshal
knowing
a
word
of
it
when
he
was
entering
gijon
the
army
of
la
romana
attacked
the
center
of
the
regiments
of
the
division
marchand
which
being
scattered
to
guard
galicia
barely
escaped
and
that
only
by
the
prompt
return
of
the
marshal
to
lugo
this
war
presented
a
thousand
incidents
as
striking
as
this
all
the
gold
of
mexico
could
not
have
procured
reliable
information
for
the
french
what
was
given
was
but
a
lure
to
make
them
fall
more
readily
into
snares
no
army
however
disciplined
can
contend
successfully
against
such
a
system
applied
to
a
great
nation
unless
it
be
strong
enough
to
hold
all
the
essential
points
of
the
country
cover
its
communications
and
at
the
same
time
furnish
an
active
force
sufficient
to
beat
the
enemy
wherever
he
may
present
himself
if
this
enemy
has
a
regular
army
of
respectable
size
to
be
a
nucleus
around
which
to
rally
the
people
what
force
will
be
sufficient
to
be
superior
everywhere
and
to
assure
the
safety
of
the
long
lines
of
communication
against
numerous
bodies
the
peninsular
war
should
be
carefully
studied
to
learn
all
the
obstacles
which
a
general
and
his
brave
troops
may
encounter
in
the
occupation
or
conquest
of
a
country
whose
people
are
all
in
arms
what
efforts
of
patience
courage
and
resignation
did
it
not
cost
the
troops
of
napoleon
massena
soult
ney
and
suchet
to
sustain
themselves
for
six
years
against
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
armed
spaniards
and
portuguese
supported
by
the
regular
armies
of
wellington
beresford
blake
la
romana
cuesta
castaños
reding
and
ballasteros
if
success
be
possible
in
such
a
war
the
following
general
course
will
be
most
likely
to
insure
it
viz
make
a
display
of
a
mass
of
troops
proportioned
to
the
obstacles
and
resistance
likely
to
be
encountered
calm
the
popular
passions
in
every
possible
way
exhaust
them
by
time
and
patience
display
courtesy
gentleness
and
severity
united
and
particularly
deal
justly
the
examples
of
henry
iv
in
the
wars
of
the
league
of
marshal
berwick
in
catalonia
of
suchet
in
aragon
and
valencia
of
hoche
in
la
vendée
are
models
of
their
kind
which
may
be
employed
according
to
circumstances
with
equal
success
the
admirable
order
and
discipline
of
the
armies
of
diebitsch
and
paskevitch
in
the
late
war
were
also
models
and
were
not
a
little
conducive
to
the
success
of
their
enterprises
the
immense
obstacles
encountered
by
an
invading
force
in
these
wars
have
led
some
speculative
persons
to
hope
that
there
should
never
be
any
other
kind
since
then
wars
would
become
more
rare
and
conquest
being
also
more
difficult
would
be
less
a
temptation
to
ambitious
leaders
this
reasoning
is
rather
plausible
than
solid
for
to
admit
all
its
consequences
it
would
be
necessary
always
to
be
able
to
induce
the
people
to
take
up
arms
and
it
would
also
be
necessary
for
us
to
be
convinced
that
there
would
be
in
the
future
no
wars
but
those
of
conquest
and
that
all
legitimate
though
secondary
wars
which
are
only
to
maintain
the
political
equilibrium
or
defend
the
public
interests
should
never
occur
again
otherwise
how
could
it
be
known
when
and
how
to
excite
the
people
to
a
national
war
for
example
if
one
hundred
thousand
germans
crossed
the
rhine
and
entered
france
originally
with
the
intention
of
preventing
the
conquest
of
belgium
by
france
and
without
any
other
ambitious
project
would
it
be
a
case
where
the
whole
population
men
women
and
children
of
alsace
lorraine
champagne
and
burgundy
should
rush
to
arms
to
make
a
saragossa
of
every
walled
town
to
bring
about
by
way
of
reprisals
murder
pillage
and
incendiarism
throughout
the
country
if
all
this
be
not
done
and
the
germans
in
consequence
of
some
success
should
occupy
these
provinces
who
can
say
that
they
might
not
afterward
seek
to
appropriate
a
part
of
them
even
though
at
first
they
had
never
contemplated
it
the
difficulty
of
answering
these
two
questions
would
seem
to
argue
in
favor
of
national
wars
but
is
there
no
means
of
repelling
such
an
invasion
without
bringing
about
an
uprising
of
the
whole
population
and
a
war
of
extermination
is
there
no
mean
between
these
contests
between
the
people
and
the
old
regular
method
of
war
between
permanent
armies
will
it
not
be
sufficient
for
the
efficient
defense
of
the
country
to
organize
a
militia
or
landwehr
which
uniformed
and
called
by
their
governments
into
service
would
regulate
the
part
the
people
should
take
in
the
war
and
place
just
limits
to
its
barbarities
i
answer
in
the
affirmative
and
applying
this
mixed
system
to
the
cases
stated
above
i
will
guarantee
that
fifty
thousand
regular
french
troops
supported
by
the
national
guards
of
the
east
would
get
the
better
of
this
german
army
which
had
crossed
the
vosges
for
reduced
to
fifty
thousand
men
by
many
detachments
upon
nearing
the
meuse
or
arriving
in
argonne
it
would
have
one
hundred
thousand
men
on
its
hands
to
attain
this
mean
we
have
laid
it
down
as
a
necessity
that
good
national
reserves
be
prepared
for
the
army
which
will
be
less
expensive
in
peace
and
will
insure
the
defense
of
the
country
in
war
this
system
was
used
by
france
in
imitated
by
austria
in
and
by
the
whole
of
germany
in
i
sum
up
this
discussion
by
asserting
that
without
being
a
utopian
philanthropist
or
a
condottieri
a
person
may
desire
that
wars
of
extermination
may
be
banished
from
the
code
of
nations
and
that
the
defenses
of
nations
by
disciplined
militia
with
the
aid
of
good
political
alliances
may
be
sufficient
to
insure
their
independence
as
a
soldier
preferring
loyal
and
chivalrous
warfare
to
organized
assassination
if
it
be
necessary
to
make
a
choice
i
acknowledge
that
my
prejudices
are
in
favor
of
the
good
old
times
when
the
french
and
english
guards
courteously
invited
each
other
to
fire
first
as
at
fontenoy
preferring
them
to
the
frightful
epoch
when
priests
women
and
children
throughout
spain
plotted
the
murder
of
isolated
soldiers
article
ix
civil
wars
and
wars
of
religion
intestine
wars
when
not
connected
with
a
foreign
quarrel
are
generally
the
result
of
a
conflict
of
opinions
of
political
or
religious
sectarianism
in
the
middle
ages
they
were
more
frequently
the
collisions
of
feudal
parties
religious
wars
are
above
all
the
most
deplorable
we
can
understand
how
a
government
may
find
it
necessary
to
use
force
against
its
own
subjects
in
order
to
crush
out
factions
which
would
weaken
the
authority
of
the
throne
and
the
national
strength
but
that
it
should
murder
its
citizens
to
compel
them
to
say
their
prayers
in
french
or
latin
or
to
recognize
the
supremacy
of
a
foreign
pontiff
is
difficult
of
conception
never
was
a
king
more
to
be
pitied
than
louis
who
persecuted
a
million
of
industrious
protestants
who
had
put
upon
the
throne
his
own
protestant
ancestor
wars
of
fanaticism
are
horrible
when
mingled
with
exterior
wars
and
they
are
also
frightful
when
they
are
family
quarrels
the
history
of
france
in
the
times
of
the
league
should
be
an
eternal
lesson
for
nations
and
kings
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
a
people
so
noble
and
chivalrous
in
the
time
of
francis
should
in
twenty
years
have
fallen
into
so
deplorable
a
state
of
brutality
to
give
maxims
in
such
wars
would
be
absurd
there
is
one
rule
upon
which
all
thoughtful
men
will
be
agreed
that
is
to
unite
the
two
parties
or
sects
to
drive
the
foreigners
from
the
soil
and
afterward
to
reconcile
by
treaty
the
conflicting
claims
or
rights
indeed
the
intervention
of
a
third
power
in
a
religious
dispute
can
only
be
with
ambitious
views
governments
may
in
good
faith
intervene
to
prevent
the
spreading
of
a
political
disease
whose
principles
threaten
social
order
and
although
these
fears
are
generally
exaggerated
and
are
often
mere
pretexts
it
is
possible
that
a
state
may
believe
its
own
institutions
menaced
but
in
religious
disputes
this
is
never
the
case
and
philip
ii
could
have
had
no
other
object
in
interfering
in
the
affairs
of
the
league
than
to
subject
france
to
his
influence
or
to
dismember
it
article
x
double
wars
and
the
danger
of
undertaking
two
wars
at
once
the
celebrated
maxim
of
the
romans
not
to
undertake
two
great
wars
at
the
same
time
is
so
well
known
and
so
well
appreciated
as
to
spare
the
necessity
of
demonstrating
its
wisdom
a
government
maybe
compelled
to
maintain
a
war
against
two
neighboring
states
but
it
will
be
extremely
unfortunate
if
it
does
not
find
an
ally
to
come
to
its
aid
with
a
view
to
its
own
safety
and
the
maintenance
of
the
political
equilibrium
it
will
seldom
be
the
case
that
the
nations
allied
against
it
will
have
the
same
interest
in
the
war
and
will
enter
into
it
with
all
their
resources
and
if
one
is
only
an
auxiliary
it
will
be
an
ordinary
war
louis
frederick
the
great
the
emperor
alexander
and
napoleon
sustained
gigantic
struggles
against
united
europe
when
such
contests
arise
from
voluntary
aggressions
they
are
proof
of
a
capital
error
on
the
part
of
the
state
which
invites
them
but
if
they
arise
from
imperious
and
inevitable
circumstances
they
must
be
met
by
seeking
alliances
or
by
opposing
such
means
of
resistance
as
shall
establish
something
like
equality
between
the
strength
of
the
parties
the
great
coalition
against
louis
nominally
arising
from
his
designs
on
spain
had
its
real
origin
in
previous
aggressions
which
had
alarmed
his
neighbors
to
the
combined
forces
of
europe
he
could
only
oppose
the
faithful
alliance
of
the
elector
of
bavaria
and
the
more
equivocal
one
of
the
duke
of
savoy
who
indeed
was
not
slow
in
adding
to
the
number
of
his
enemies
frederick
with
only
the
aid
of
the
subsidies
of
england
and
fifty
thousand
auxiliaries
from
six
different
states
sustained
a
war
against
the
three
most
powerful
monarchies
of
europe
the
division
and
folly
of
his
opponents
were
his
best
friends
both
these
wars
as
well
as
that
sustained
by
alexander
in
it
was
almost
impossible
to
avoid
france
had
the
whole
of
europe
on
its
hands
in
in
consequence
of
the
extravagant
provocations
of
the
jacobins
and
the
utopian
ideas
of
the
girondists
who
boasted
that
with
the
support
of
the
english
fleets
they
would
defy
all
the
kings
in
the
world
the
result
of
these
absurd
calculations
was
a
frightful
upheaval
of
europe
from
which
france
miraculously
escaped
napoleon
is
to
a
certain
degree
the
only
modern
sovereign
who
has
voluntarily
at
the
same
time
undertaken
two
and
even
three
formidable
wars
with
spain
with
england
and
with
russia
but
in
the
last
case
he
expected
the
aid
of
austria
and
prussia
to
say
nothing
of
that
of
turkey
and
sweden
upon
which
he
counted
with
too
much
certainty
so
that
the
enterprise
was
not
so
adventurous
on
his
part
as
has
been
generally
supposed
it
will
be
observed
that
there
is
a
great
distinction
between
a
war
made
against
a
single
state
which
is
aided
by
a
third
acting
as
an
auxiliary
and
two
wars
conducted
at
the
same
time
against
two
powerful
nations
in
opposite
quarters
who
employ
all
their
forces
and
resources
for
instance
the
double
contest
of
napoleon
in
against
austria
and
spain
aided
by
england
was
a
very
different
affair
from
a
contest
with
austria
assisted
by
an
auxiliary
force
of
a
given
strength
these
latter
contests
belong
to
ordinary
wars
it
follows
then
in
general
that
double
wars
should
be
avoided
if
possible
and
if
cause
of
war
be
given
by
two
states
it
is
more
prudent
to
dissimulate
or
neglect
the
wrongs
suffered
from
one
of
them
until
a
proper
opportunity
for
redressing
them
shall
arrive
the
rule
however
is
not
without
exception
the
respective
forces
the
localities
the
possibility
of
finding
allies
to
restore
in
a
measure
equality
of
strength
between
the
parties
are
circumstances
which
will
influence
a
government
so
threatened
we
now
have
fulfilled
our
task
in
noting
both
the
danger
and
the
means
of
remedying
it
chapter
ii
military
policy
we
have
already
explained
what
we
understand
by
this
title
it
embraces
the
moral
combinations
relating
to
the
operations
of
armies
if
the
political
considerations
which
we
have
just
discussed
be
also
moral
there
are
others
which
influence
in
a
certain
degree
the
conduct
of
a
war
which
belong
neither
to
diplomacy
strategy
nor
tactics
we
include
these
under
the
head
of
military
policy
may
be
said
to
embrace
all
the
combinations
of
any
projected
war
except
those
relating
to
the
diplomatic
art
and
strategy
and
as
their
number
is
considerable
a
separate
article
can
not
be
assigned
to
each
without
enlarging
too
much
the
limits
of
this
work
and
without
deviating
from
my
intention
which
is
not
to
give
a
treatise
on
theses
subjects
but
to
point
out
their
relations
to
military
operations
indeed
in
this
class
we
may
place
the
passions
of
the
nation
to
be
fought
their
military
system
their
immediate
means
and
their
reserves
their
financial
resources
the
attachment
they
bear
to
their
government
or
their
institutions
the
character
of
the
executive
the
characters
and
military
abilities
of
the
commanders
of
their
armies
the
influence
of
cabinet
councils
or
councils
of
war
at
the
capital
upon
their
operations
the
system
of
war
in
favor
with
their
staff
the
established
force
of
the
state
and
its
armament
the
military
geography
and
statistics
of
the
state
which
is
to
be
invaded
and
finally
the
resources
and
obstacles
of
every
kind
likely
to
be
met
with
all
of
which
are
included
neither
in
diplomacy
nor
in
strategy
there
are
no
fixed
rules
on
such
subjects
except
that
the
government
should
neglect
nothing
in
obtaining
a
knowledge
of
these
details
and
that
it
is
indispensable
to
take
them
into
consideration
in
the
arrangement
of
all
plans
we
propose
to
sketch
the
principal
points
which
ought
to
guide
in
this
sort
of
combinations
article
xi
military
statistics
and
geography
by
the
first
of
these
sciences
we
understand
the
most
thorough
knowledge
possible
of
the
elements
of
power
and
military
resources
of
the
enemy
with
whom
we
are
called
upon
to
contend
the
second
consists
in
the
topographical
and
strategic
description
of
the
theater
of
war
with
all
the
obstacles
natural
or
artificial
to
be
encountered
and
the
examination
of
the
permanent
decisive
points
which
may
be
presented
in
the
whole
extent
of
the
frontier
or
throughout
the
extent
of
the
country
besides
the
minister
of
war
the
commanding
general
and
his
chief
of
staff
should
be
afforded
this
information
under
the
penalty
of
cruel
miscalculations
in
their
plans
as
happens
frequently
in
our
day
despite
the
great
strides
civilized
nations
have
taken
in
statistical
diplomatic
geographical
and
topographical
sciences
i
will
cite
two
examples
of
which
i
was
cognizant
in
moreau
army
entering
the
black
forest
expected
to
find
terrible
mountains
frightful
defiles
and
forests
and
was
greatly
surprised
to
discover
after
climbing
the
declivities
of
the
plateau
that
slope
to
the
rhine
that
these
with
their
spurs
were
the
only
mountains
and
that
the
country
from
the
sources
of
the
danube
to
donauwerth
was
a
rich
and
level
plain
the
second
example
was
in
napoleon
and
his
whole
army
supposed
the
interior
of
bohemia
to
be
very
mountainous
whereas
there
is
no
district
in
europe
more
level
after
the
girdle
of
mountains
surrounding
it
has
been
crossed
which
may
be
done
in
a
single
march
all
european
officers
held
the
same
erroneous
opinions
in
reference
to
the
balkan
and
the
turkish
force
in
the
interior
it
seemed
that
it
was
given
out
at
constantinople
that
this
province
was
an
almost
impregnable
barrier
and
the
palladium
of
the
empire
an
error
which
i
having
lived
in
the
alps
did
not
entertain
other
prejudices
not
less
deeply
rooted
have
led
to
the
belief
that
a
people
all
the
individuals
of
which
are
constantly
armed
would
constitute
a
formidable
militia
and
would
defend
themselves
to
the
last
extremity
experience
has
proved
that
the
old
regulations
which
placed
the
elite
of
the
janissaries
in
the
of
the
danube
made
the
population
of
those
cities
more
warlike
than
the
inhabitants
of
the
interior
in
fact
the
projects
of
reform
of
the
sultan
mahmoud
required
the
overthrow
of
the
old
system
and
there
was
no
time
to
replace
it
by
the
new
so
that
the
empire
was
defenseless
experience
has
constantly
proved
that
a
mere
multitude
of
brave
men
armed
to
the
teeth
make
neither
a
good
army
nor
a
national
defense
let
us
return
to
the
necessity
of
knowing
well
the
military
geography
and
statistics
of
an
empire
these
sciences
are
not
set
forth
in
treatises
and
are
yet
to
be
developed
lloyd
who
wrote
an
essay
upon
them
in
describing
the
frontiers
of
the
great
states
of
europe
was
not
fortunate
in
his
maxims
and
predictions
he
saw
obstacles
everywhere
he
represents
as
impregnable
the
austrian
frontier
on
the
inn
between
the
tyrol
and
passau
where
napoleon
and
moreau
maneuvered
and
triumphed
with
armies
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
in
and
but
if
these
sciences
are
not
publicly
taught
the
archives
of
the
european
staff
must
necessarily
possess
many
documents
valuable
for
instruction
in
them
at
least
for
the
special
staff
school
awaiting
the
time
when
some
studious
officer
profiting
by
those
published
and
unpublished
documents
shall
present
europe
with
a
good
military
and
strategic
geography
we
may
thanks
to
the
immense
progress
of
topography
of
late
years
partially
supply
the
want
of
it
by
the
excellent
charts
published
in
all
european
countries
within
the
last
twenty
years
at
the
beginning
of
the
french
revolution
topography
was
in
its
infancy
excepting
the
map
of
cassini
the
works
of
bakenberg
alone
merited
the
name
the
austrian
and
prussian
staff
schools
however
were
good
and
have
since
borne
fruit
the
charts
published
recently
at
vienna
at
berlin
munich
stuttgart
and
paris
as
well
as
those
of
the
institute
of
herder
at
fribourg
promise
to
future
generals
immense
resources
unknown
to
their
predecessors
military
statistics
is
not
much
better
known
than
geography
we
have
but
vague
and
superficial
statements
from
which
the
strength
of
armies
and
navies
is
conjectured
and
also
the
revenue
supposed
to
be
possessed
by
a
state
which
is
far
from
being
the
knowledge
necessary
to
plan
operations
our
object
here
is
not
to
discuss
thoroughly
these
important
subjects
but
to
indicate
them
as
facilitating
success
in
military
enterprises
article
xii
other
causes
which
exercise
an
influence
upon
the
success
of
a
war
as
the
excited
passions
of
a
people
are
of
themselves
always
a
powerful
enemy
both
the
general
and
his
government
should
use
their
best
efforts
to
allay
them
we
have
nothing
to
add
to
what
has
been
said
on
this
point
under
the
head
of
national
wars
on
the
other
hand
the
general
should
do
every
thing
to
electrify
his
own
soldiers
and
to
impart
to
them
the
same
enthusiasm
which
he
endeavors
to
repress
in
his
adversaries
all
armies
are
alike
susceptible
of
this
spirit
the
springs
of
action
and
means
only
vary
with
the
national
character
military
eloquence
is
one
means
and
has
been
the
subject
of
many
a
treatise
the
proclamations
of
napoleon
and
of
paskevitch
the
addresses
of
the
ancients
to
their
soldiers
and
those
of
suwaroff
to
men
of
still
greater
simplicity
are
models
of
their
different
kinds
the
eloquence
of
the
spanish
juntas
and
the
miracles
of
the
madonna
del
pilar
led
to
the
same
results
by
very
different
means
in
general
a
cherished
cause
and
a
general
who
inspires
confidence
by
previous
success
are
powerful
means
of
electrifying
an
army
and
conducing
to
victory
some
dispute
the
advantages
of
this
enthusiasm
and
prefer
imperturbable
coolness
in
battle
both
have
unmistakable
advantages
and
disadvantages
enthusiasm
impels
to
the
performance
of
great
actions
the
difficulty
is
in
maintaining
it
constantly
and
when
discouragement
succeeds
it
disorder
easily
results
the
greater
or
less
activity
and
boldness
of
the
commanders
of
the
armies
are
elements
of
success
or
failure
which
can
not
be
submitted
to
rules
a
cabinet
and
a
commander
ought
to
consider
the
intrinsic
value
of
their
troops
and
that
resulting
from
their
organization
as
compared
with
that
of
the
enemy
a
russian
general
commanding
the
most
solidly
organized
troops
in
europe
need
not
fear
to
undertake
any
thing
against
undisciplined
and
unorganized
troops
in
an
open
country
however
brave
may
be
its
individuals
concert
in
action
makes
strength
order
produces
this
concert
and
discipline
insures
order
and
without
discipline
and
order
no
success
is
possible
the
russian
general
would
not
be
so
bold
before
european
troops
having
the
same
instruction
and
nearly
the
same
discipline
as
his
own
finally
a
general
may
attempt
with
a
mack
as
his
antagonist
what
it
would
be
madness
to
do
with
a
napoleon
the
action
of
a
cabinet
in
reference
to
the
control
of
armies
influences
the
boldness
of
their
operations
a
general
whose
genius
and
hands
are
tied
by
an
aulic
council
five
hundred
miles
distant
can
not
be
a
match
for
one
who
has
liberty
of
action
other
things
being
equal
as
to
superiority
in
skill
it
is
one
of
the
most
certain
pledges
of
victory
all
other
things
being
equal
it
is
true
that
great
generals
have
often
been
beaten
by
inferior
ones
but
an
exception
does
not
make
a
rule
an
order
misunderstood
a
fortuitous
event
may
throw
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
all
the
chances
of
success
which
a
skillful
general
had
prepared
for
himself
by
his
maneuvers
but
these
are
risks
which
can
not
be
foreseen
nor
avoided
would
it
be
fair
on
that
account
to
deny
the
influence
of
science
and
principles
in
ordinary
affairs
this
risk
even
proves
the
triumph
of
the
principles
for
it
happens
that
they
are
applied
accidentally
by
the
army
against
which
it
was
intended
to
apply
them
and
are
the
cause
of
its
success
but
in
admitting
this
truth
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
an
argument
against
science
this
objection
is
not
well
founded
for
a
general
science
consists
in
providing
for
his
side
all
the
chances
possible
to
be
foreseen
and
of
course
can
not
extend
to
the
caprices
of
destiny
even
if
the
number
of
battles
gained
by
skillful
maneuvers
did
not
exceed
the
number
due
to
accident
it
would
not
invalidate
my
assertion
if
the
skill
of
a
general
is
one
of
the
surest
elements
of
victory
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
the
judicious
selection
of
generals
is
one
of
the
most
delicate
points
in
the
science
of
government
and
one
of
the
most
essential
parts
of
the
military
policy
of
a
state
unfortunately
this
choice
is
influenced
by
so
many
petty
passions
that
chance
rank
age
favor
party
spirit
jealousy
will
have
as
much
to
do
with
it
as
the
public
interest
and
justice

subject
is
so
important
that
we
will
devote

military
institutions
one
of
the
most
important
points
of
the
military
policy
of
a
state
is
the
nature
of
its
military
institutions
a
good
army
commanded
by
a
general
of
ordinary
capacity
may
accomplish
great
feats
a
bad
army
with
a
good
general
may
do
equally
well
but
an
army
will
certainly
do
a
great
deal
more
if
its
own
superiority
and
that
of
the
general
be
combined
twelve
essential
conditions
concur
in
making
a
perfect
army
to
have
a
good
a
good
organization
a
system
of
national
reserves
good
instruction
of
officers
and
men
in
drill
and
internal
duties
as
well
as
those
of
a
campaign
a
strict
but
not
humiliating
discipline
and
a
spirit
of
subordination
and
punctuality
based
on
conviction
rather
than
on
the
formalities
of
the
service
a
system
of
rewards
suitable
to
excite
emulation
the
special
arms
of
engineering
and
artillery
to
be
well
instructed
an
armament
superior
if
possible
to
that
of
the
enemy
both
as
to
defensive
and
offensive
arms
a
general
staff
capable
of
applying
these
elements
and
having
an
organization
calculated
to
advance
the
theoretical
and
practical
education
of
its
officers
a
good
system
for
the
commissariat
hospitals
and
of
general
administration
a
good
system
of
assignment
to
command
and
of
directing
the
principal
operations
of
war
exciting
and
keeping
alive
the
military
spirit
of
the
people
to
these
conditions
might
be
added
a
good
system
of
clothing
and
equipment
for
if
this
be
of
less
direct
importance
on
the
field
of
battle
it
nevertheless
has
a
bearing
upon
the
preservation
of
the
troops
and
it
is
always
a
great
object
to
economize
the
lives
and
health
of
veterans
none
of
the
above
twelve
conditions
can
be
neglected
without
grave
inconvenience
a
fine
army
well
drilled
and
disciplined
but
without
national
reserves
and
unskillfully
led
suffered
prussia
to
fall
in
fifteen
days
under
the
attacks
of
napoleon
on
the
other
hand
it
has
often
been
seen
of
how
much
advantage
it
is
for
a
state
to
have
a
good
army
it
was
the
care
and
skill
of
philip
and
alexander
in
forming
and
instructing
their
phalanxes
and
rendering
them
easy
to
move
and
capable
of
the
most
rapid
maneuvers
which
enabled
the
macedonians
to
subjugate
india
and
persia
with
a
handful
of
choice
troops
it
was
the
excessive
love
of
his
father
for
soldiers
which
procured
for
frederick
the
great
an
army
capable
of
executing
his
great
enterprises
a
government
which
neglects
its
army
under
any
pretext
whatever
is
thus
culpable
in
the
eyes
of
posterity
since
it
prepares
humiliation
for
its
standards
and
its
country
instead
of
by
a
different
course
preparing
for
it
success
we
are
far
from
saying
that
a
government
should
sacrifice
every
thing
to
the
army
for
this
would
be
absurd
but
it
ought
to
make
the
army
the
object
of
its
constant
care
and
if
the
prince
has
not
a
military
education
it
will
be
very
difficult
for
him
to
fulfill
his
duty
in
this
respect
in
this
case
which
is
unfortunately
of
too
frequent
occurrence
the
defect
must
be
supplied
by
wise
institutions
at
the
head
of
which
are
to
be
placed
a
good
system
of
the
general
staff
a
good
system
of
recruiting
and
a
good
system
of
national
reserves
there
are
indeed
forms
of
government
which
do
not
always
allow
the
executive
the
power
of
adopting
the
best
systems
if
the
armies
of
the
roman
and
french
republics
and
those
of
louis
xiv
and
frederick
of
prussia
prove
that
a
good
military
system
and
a
skillful
direction
of
operations
may
be
found
in
governments
the
most
opposite
in
principle
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
in
the
present
state
of
the
world
the
form
of
government
exercises
a
great
influence
in
the
development
of
the
military
strength
of
a
nation
and
the
value
of
its
troops
when
the
control
of
the
public
funds
is
in
the
hands
of
those
affected
by
local
interest
or
party
spirit
they
may
be
so
and
penurious
as
to
take
all
power
to
carry
on
the
war
from
the
executive
whom
very
many
people
seem
to
regard
as
a
public
enemy
rather
than
as
a
chief
devoted
to
all
the
national
interests
the
abuse
of
public
liberties
may
also
contribute
to
this
deplorable
result
then
it
will
be
impossible
for
the
most
administration
to
prepare
in
advance
for
a
great
war
whether
it
be
demanded
by
the
most
important
interests
of
the
country
at
some
future
time
or
whether
it
be
immediate
and
necessary
to
resist
sudden
aggressions
in
the
futile
hope
of
rendering
themselves
popular
may
not
the
members
of
an
elective
legislature
the
majority
of
whom
can
not
be
richelieus
pitts
or
louvois
in
a
misconceived
spirit
of
economy
allow
the
institutions
necessary
for
a
large
and
disciplined
army
to
fall
into
decay
deceived
by
the
seductive
fallacies
of
an
exaggerated
philanthropy
may
they
not
end
in
convincing
themselves
and
their
constituents
that
the
pleasures
of
peace
are
always
preferable
to
the
more
statesmanlike
preparations
for
war
i
am
far
from
advising
that
states
should
always
have
the
hand
upon
the
sword
and
always
be
established
on
a
such
a
condition
of
things
would
be
a
scourge
for
the
human
race
and
would
not
be
possible
except
under
conditions
not
existing
in
all
countries
i
simply
mean
that
civilized
governments
ought
always
to
be
ready
to
carry
on
a
war
in
a
short
time
that
they
should
never
be
found
unprepared
and
the
wisdom
of
their
institutions
may
do
as
much
in
this
work
of
preparation
as
foresight
in
their
administration
and
the
perfection
of
their
system
of
military
policy
if
in
ordinary
times
under
the
rule
of
constitutional
forms
governments
subjected
to
all
the
changes
of
an
elective
legislature
are
less
suitable
than
others
for
the
creation
or
preparation
of
a
formidable
military
power
nevertheless
in
great
crises
these
deliberative
bodies
have
sometimes
attained
very
different
results
and
have
concurred
in
developing
to
the
full
extent
the
national
strength
still
the
small
number
of
such
instances
in
history
makes
rather
a
list
of
exceptional
cases
in
which
a
tumultuous
and
violent
assembly
placed
under
the
necessity
of
conquering
or
perishing
has
profited
by
the
extraordinary
enthusiasm
of
the
nation
to
save
the
country
and
themselves
at
the
same
time
by
resorting
to
the
most
terrible
measures
and
by
calling
to
its
aid
an
unlimited
dictatorial
power
which
overthrew
both
liberty
and
law
under
the
pretext
of
defending
them
here
it
is
the
dictatorship
or
the
absolute
and
monstrous
usurpation
of
power
rather
than
the
form
of
the
deliberative
assembly
which
is
the
true
cause
of
the
display
of
energy
what
happened
in
the
convention
after
the
fall
of
robespierre
and
the
terrible
committee
of
public
safety
proves
this
as
well
as
the
chambers
of
now
if
the
dictatorial
power
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
few
has
always
been
a
plank
of
safety
in
great
crises
it
seems
natural
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
countries
controlled
by
elective
assemblies
must
be
politically
and
militarily
weaker
than
pure
monarchies
although
in
other
respects
they
present
decided
advantages
it
is
particularly
necessary
to
watch
over
the
preservation
of
armies
in
the
interval
of
a
long
peace
for
then
they
are
most
likely
to
degenerate
it
is
important
to
foster
the
military
spirit
in
the
armies
and
to
exercise
them
in
great
maneuvers
which
though
but
faintly
resembling
those
of
actual
war
still
are
of
decided
advantage
in
preparing
them
for
war
it
is
not
less
important
to
prevent
them
from
becoming
effeminate
which
may
be
done
by
employing
them
in
labors
useful
for
the
defense
of
the
country
the
isolation
in
garrisons
of
troops
by
regiments
is
one
of
the
worst
possible
systems
and
the
russian
and
prussian
system
of
divisions
and
permanent
corps
seems
to
be
much
preferable
in
general
terms
the
russian
army
now
may
be
presented
as
a
model
in
many
respects
and
if
in
many
points
its
customs
would
be
useless
and
impracticable
elsewhere
it
must
be
admitted
that
many
good
institutions
might
well
be
copied
from
it
as
to
rewards
and
promotion
it
is
essential
to
respect
long
service
and
at
the
same
time
to
open
a
way
for
merit
of
the
promotions
in
each
grade
should
be
made
according
to
the
roster
and
the
remaining
fourth
reserved
for
those
distinguished
for
merit
and
zeal
on
the
contrary
in
time
of
war
the
regular
order
of
promotion
should
be
suspended
or
at
least
reduced
to
a
third
of
the
promotions
leaving
the
other
for
brilliant
conduct
and
marked
services
the
superiority
of
armament
may
increase
the
chances
of
success
in
war
it
does
not
of
itself
gain
battles
but
it
is
a
great
element
of
success
every
one
can
recall
how
nearly
fatal
to
the
french
at
bylau
and
marengo
was
their
great
inferiority
in
artillery
we
may
also
refer
to
the
great
gain
of
the
heavy
french
cavalry
in
the
resumption
of
the
cuirass
which
they
had
for
so
long
thrown
aside
every
one
knows
the
great
advantage
of
the
lance
doubtless
as
skirmishers
lancers
would
not
be
more
effectual
than
hussars
but
when
charging
in
line
it
is
a
very
different
affair
how
many
brave
cavalry
soldiers
have
been
the
victims
of
the
prejudice
they
bore
against
the
lance
because
it
was
a
little
more
trouble
to
carry
than
a
saber
the
armament
of
armies
is
still
susceptible
of
great
improvements
the
state
which
shall
take
the
lead
in
making
them
will
secure
great
advantages
there
is
little
left
to
be
desired
in
artillery
but
the
offensive
and
defensive
arms
of
infantry
and
cavalry
deserve
the
attention
of
a
provident
government
the
new
inventions
of
the
last
twenty
years
seem
to
threaten
a
great
revolution
in
army
organization
armament
and
tactics
strategy
alone
will
remain
unaltered
with
its
principles
the
same
as
under
the
scipios
and
cæsars
frederick
and
napoleon
since
they
are
independent
of
the
nature
of
the
arms
and
the
organization
of
the
troops
the
means
of
destruction
are
approaching
perfection
with
frightful
rapidity
the
congreve
rockets
the
effect
and
direction
of
which
it
is
said
the
austrians
can
now
regulate
the
shrapnel
howitzers
which
throw
a
stream
of
canister
as
far
as
the
range
of
a
bullet
the
perkins
which
vomit
forth
as
many
balls
as
a
battalion
will
multiply
the
chances
of
destruction
as
though
the
hecatombs
of
eylau
borodino
leipsic
and
waterloo
were
not
sufficient
to
decimate
the
european
races
if
governments
do
not
combine
in
a
congress
to
proscribe
these
inventions
of
destruction
there
will
be
no
course
left
but
to
make
the
half
of
an
army
consist
of
cavalry
with
cuirasses
in
order
to
capture
with
great
rapidity
these
machines
and
the
infantry
even
will
be
obliged
to
resume
its
armor
of
the
middle
ages
without
which
a
battalion
will
be
destroyed
before
engaging
the
enemy
we
may
then
see
again
the
famous
all
covered
with
armor
and
horses
also
will
require
the
same
protection
while
there
is
doubt
about
the
realization
of
these
fears
it
is
however
certain
that
artillery
and
pyrotechny
have
made
advances
which
should
lead
us
to
think
of
modifying
the
deep
formation
so
much
abused
by
napoleon
we
will
recur
to
this
in
the
chapter
on
tactics
we
will
here
recapitulate
in
a
few
words
the
essential
bases
of
the
military
policy
which
ought
to
be
adopted
by
a
wise
government
the
prince
should
receive
an
education
both
political
and
military
he
will
more
probably
find
men
of
administrative
ability
in
his
councils
than
good
statesmen
or
soldiers
and
hence
he
should
be
both
of
the
latter
himself
if
the
prince
in
person
does
not
lead
his
armies
it
will
be
his
first
duty
and
his
nearest
interest
to
have
his
place
well
supplied
he
must
confide
the
glory
of
his
reign
and
the
safety
of
his
states
to
the
general
most
capable
of
directing
his
armies
the
permanent
army
should
not
only
always
be
upon
a
respectable
footing
but
it
should
be
capable
of
being
doubled
if
necessary
by
reserves
which
should
always
be
prepared
its
instruction
and
discipline
should
be
of
a
high
character
as
well
as
its
organization
its
armament
should
at
least
be
as
good
as
that
of
its
neighbors
and
superior
if
possible
the
matériel
of
war
should
also
be
upon
the
best
footing
and
abundant
the
reserves
should
be
stored
in
the
depots
and
arsenals
national
jealousy
should
not
be
allowed
to
prevent
the
adoption
of
all
improvements
in
this
matériel
made
in
other
countries
it
is
necessary
that
the
study
of
the
military
sciences
should
be
encouraged
and
rewarded
as
well
as
courage
and
zeal
the
scientific
military
corps
should
be
esteemed
and
honored
this
is
the
only
way
of
securing
for
the
army
men
of
merit
and
genius
the
general
staff
in
times
of
peace
should
be
employed
in
labors
preparatory
for
all
possible
contingencies
of
war
its
archives
should
be
furnished
with
numerous
historical
details
of
the
past
and
with
all
statistical
geographical
topographical
and
strategic
treatises
and
papers
for
the
present
and
future
hence
it
is
essential
that
the
chief
of
this
corps
with
a
number
of
its
officers
should
be
permanently
stationed
at
the
capital
in
time
of
peace
and
the
should
be
simply
that
of
the
general
staff
except
that
there
should
be
a
secret
department
for
those
documents
to
be
concealed
from
the
subalterns
of
the
corps
nothing
should
be
neglected
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
the
geography
and
the
military
statistics
of
other
states
so
as
to
know
their
material
and
moral
capacity
for
attack
and
defense
as
well
as
the
strategic
advantages
of
the
two
parties
distinguished
officers
should
be
employed
in
these
scientific
labors
and
should
be
rewarded
when
they
acquit
themselves
with
marked
ability
when
a
war
is
decided
upon
it
becomes
necessary
to
prepare
not
an
entire
plan
of
operations
which
is
always
impossible
but
a
system
of
operations
in
reference
to
a
prescribed
aim
to
provide
a
base
as
well
as
all
the
material
means
necessary
to
guarantee
the
success
of
the
enterprise
the
system
of
operations
ought
to
be
determined
by
the
object
of
the
war
the
kind
of
forces
of
the
enemy
the
nature
and
resources
of
the
country
the
characters
of
the
nations
and
of
their
chiefs
whether
of
the
army
or
of
the
state
in
fine
it
should
be
based
upon
the
moral
and
material
means
of
attack
or
defense
which
the
enemy
may
be
able
to
bring
into
action
and
it
ought
to
take
into
consideration
the
probable
alliances
that
may
obtain
in
favor
of
or
against
either
of
the
parties
during
the
war
the
financial
condition
of
a
nation
is
to
be
weighed
among
the
chances
of
a
war
still
it
would
be
dangerous
to
constantly
attribute
to
this
condition
the
importance
attached
to
it
by
frederick
the
great
in
the
history
of
his
times
he
was
probably
right
at
his
epoch
when
armies
were
chiefly
recruited
by
voluntary
enlistment
when
the
last
crown
brought
the
last
soldier
but
when
national
levies
are
well
organised
money
will
no
longer
exercise
the
same
influence
at
least
for
one
or
two
campaigns
if
england
has
proved
that
money
will
procure
soldiers
and
auxiliaries
france
has
proved
that
love
of
country
and
honor
are
equally
productive
and
that
when
necessary
war
may
be
made
to
support
war
france
indeed
in
the
fertility
of
her
soil
and
the
enthusiasm
of
her
leaders
possessed
sources
of
temporary
power
which
can
not
be
adopted
as
a
general
base
of
a
system
but
the
results
of
its
efforts
were
none
the
less
striking
every
year
the
numerous
reports
of
the
cabinet
of
london
and
particularly
of
announced
that
france
was
about
to
break
down
for
want
of
money
while
napoleon
had
francs
in
the
vaults
of
the
tuileries
all
the
while
meeting
the
expenses
of
the
government
including
the
pay
of
his
armies
a
power
might
be
overrunning
with
gold
and
still
defend
itself
very
badly
history
indeed
proves
that
the
richest
nation
is
neither
the
strongest
nor
the
happiest
iron
weighs
at
least
as
much
as
gold
in
the
scales
of
military
strength
still
we
must
admit
that
a
happy
combination
of
wise
military
institutions
of
patriotism
of
finances
of
internal
wealth
and
public
credit
imparts
to
a
nation
the
greatest
strength
and
makes
it
best
capable
of
sustaining
a
long
war
a
volume
would
be
necessary
to
discuss
all
the
circumstances
under
which
a
nation
may
develop
more
or
less
strength
either
by
its
gold
or
iron
and
to
determine
the
cases
when
war
may
be
expected
to
support
war
this
result
can
only
be
obtained
by
carrying
the
army
into
the
territory
of
the
enemy
and
all
countries
are
not
equally
capable
of
furnishing
resources
to
an
assailant
we
need
not
extend
further
the
investigation
of
these
subjects
which
are
not
directly
connected
with
the
art
of
war
it
is
sufficient
for
our
purpose
to
indicate
their
relations
to
a
projected
war
and
it
will
be
for
the
statesman
to
develop
the
modifications
which
circumstances
and
localities
may
make
in
these
relations

there
was
a

in
the

at

stupendous

he
was

to

to
have
its

commanded
in

by
the
monarch
whatever
may
be
the
decision
on
this
point
it
is
certain
that
if
the
prince
possess
the
genius
of
frederick
peter
the
great
or
napoleon
he
will
be
far
from
leaving
to
his
generals
the
honor
of
performing
great
actions
which
he
might
do
himself
for
in
this
he
would
be
untrue
to
his
own
glory
and
to
the
of
the
country
as
it
is
not
our
mission
to
discuss
the
question
whether
it
is
more
fortunate
for
a
nation
to
have
a
warlike
or
a
prince
which
is
a
philanthropic
question
foreign
to
our
subject
we
will
only
state
upon
this
point
that
with
equal
merit
and
chances
in
other
respects
a
sovereign
will
always
have
an
advantage
over
a
general
who
is
himself
not
the
head
of
a
state
leaving
out
of
the
question
that
he
is
responsible
only
to
himself
for
his
bold
enterprises
he
may
do
much
by
the
certainty
he
has
of
being
able
to
dispose
of
all
the
public
resources
for
the
attainment
of
his
end
he
also
possesses
the
powerful
accessory
of
his
favor
of
recompenses
and
punishments
all
will
be
devoted
to
the
execution
of
his
orders
and
to
insure
for
his
enterprises
the
greatest
success
no
jealousy
will
interfere
with
the
execution
of
his
projects
or
at
least
its
exhibition
will
be
rare
and
in
secondary
operations
here
are
certainly
sufficient
motives
to
induce
a
prince
to
lead
his
armies
if
he
possess
military
capacity
and
the
contest
be
of
a
magnitude
worthy
of
him
but
if
he
possess
no
military
ability
if
his
character
be
feeble
and
he
be
easily
influenced
his
presence
with
the
army
instead
of
producing
good
results
will
open
the
way
for
all
manner
of
intrigues
each
one
will
present
his
projects
to
him
and
as
he
will
not
have
the
experience
necessary
to
estimate
them
according
to
their
merits
he
will
submit
his
judgment
to
that
of
his
intimates
his
general
interfered
with
and
opposed
in
all
his
enterprises
will
be
unable
to
achieve
success
even
if
he
have
the
requisite
ability
it
may
be
said
that
a
sovereign
might
accompany
the
army
and
not
interfere
with
his
general
but
on
the
contrary
aid
him
with
all
the
weight
of
his
influence
in
this
case
his
presence
might
be
productive
of
good
results
but
it
also
might
lead
to
great
embarrassment
if
the
army
were
turned
and
cut
off
from
its
communications
and
obliged
to
extricate
itself
sword
in
hand
what
sad
results
might
not
follow
from
the
presence
of
the
sovereign
at
when
a
prince
feels
the
necessity
of
taking
the
field
at
the
head
of
his
armies
but
lacks
the
necessary
to
assume
the
supreme
direction
of
affairs
the
best
course
will
be
that
adopted
by
the
prussian
government
with
blücher
viz
he
should
be
accompanied
by
two
generals
of
the
best
capacity
one
of
them
a
man
of
executive
ability
the
other
a
staff
officer
if
this
trinity
be
harmonious
it
may
yield
excellent
results
as
in
the
case
of
the
army
of
silesia
in
the
same
system
might
apply
in
the
case
where
the
sovereign
judges
it
proper
to
intrust
the
command
to
a
prince
of
his
house
as
has
frequently
happened
since
the
time
of
louis
xiv
it
has
often
occurred
that
the
prince
possessed
only
the
titular
command
and
that
an
adviser
who
in
reality
commanded
was
imposed
upon
him
this
was
the
case
with
the
duke
of
orleans
and
marsin
at
the
famous
battle
of
turin
afterward
with
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
vendôme
at
the
battle
of
audenarde
and
i
think
also
at
ulm
with
the
archduke
ferdinand
and
mack
this
system
is
deplorable
since
no
one
is
responsible
for
what
is
done
it
is
known
that
at
the
battle
of
turin
the
duke
of
orleans
exhibited
more
sagacity
than
marsin
and
it
became
necessary
for
the
latter
to
show
full
secret
authority
from
the
king
before
the
prince
would
yield
his
judgment
and
allow
the
battle
to
be
lost
so
at
ulm
the
archduke
displayed
more
skill
and
courage
than
mack
who
was
to
be
his
mentor
if
the
prince
possess
the
genius
and
experience
of
the
archduke
charles
he
should
be
invested
with
the
untrammeled
command
and
be
allowed
full
selection
of
his
instruments
if
he
have
not
yet
acquired
the
same
titles
to
command
he
may
then
be
provided
with
an
educated
general
of
the
staff
and
another
general
distinguished
for
his
talent
in
execution
but
in
no
case
will
it
be
wise
to
invest
either
of
these
counselors
with
more
authority
than
a
voice
in
consultation
we
have
already
said
that
if
the
prince
do
not
conduct
his
armies
in
person
his
most
important
duty
will
be
to
have
the
position
of
commander
well
filled
which
unfortunately
is
not
always
done
without
going
back
to
ancient
times
it
will
be
sufficient
to
recall
the
more
modern
examples
under
louis
xiv
and
louis
xv
the
merit
of
prince
eugene
was
estimated
by
his
deformed
figure
and
this
drove
him
the
ablest
commander
of
his
time
into
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
after
louvois
death
tallard
marsin
and
villeroi
filled
the
places
of
turenne
condé
and
luxembourg
and
subsequently
soubise
and
clermont
succeeded
marshal
saxe
between
the
fashionable
selections
made
in
the
saloons
of
the
pompadours
and
dubarrys
and
napoleon
preference
for
mere
soldiers
there
are
many
gradations
and
the
margin
is
wide
enough
to
afford
the
least
intelligent
government
means
of
making
rational
nominations
but
in
all
ages
human
weaknesses
will
exercise
an
influence
in
one
way
or
another
and
artifice
will
often
carry
off
the
prize
from
modest
or
timid
merit
which
awaits
a
call
for
its
services
but
leaving
out
of
consideration
all
these
influences
it
will
be
profitable
to
inquire
in
what
respects
this
choice
of
a
commander
will
be
difficult
even
when
the
executive
shall
be
most
anxious
to
make
it
a
judicious
one
in
the
first
place
to
make
choice
of
a
skillful
general
requires
either
that
the
person
who
makes
the
selection
shall
be
a
military
man
able
to
form
an
intelligent
opinion
or
that
he
should
be
guided
by
the
opinions
of
others
which
opens
the
way
to
the
improper
influence
of
cliques
the
embarrassment
is
certainly
less
when
there
is
at
hand
a
general
already
illustrious
by
many
victories
but
outside
of
the
fact
that
every
general
is
not
a
great
leader
because
he
has
gained
a
battle
for
instance
jourdan
scherer
and
many
others
it
is
not
always
the
case
that
a
victorious
general
is
at
the
disposition
of
the
government
it
may
well
happen
that
after
a
long
period
of
peace
there
may
not
be
a
single
general
in
europe
who
has
commanded
in
chief
in
this
case
it
will
be
difficult
to
decide
whether
one
general
is
better
than
another
those
who
have
served
long
in
peace
will
be
at
the
head
of
their
arms
or
corps
and
will
have
the
rank
appropriate
for
this
position
but
will
they
always
be
the
most
capable
of
filling
it
moreover
the
intercourse
of
the
heads
of
a
government
with
their
subordinates
is
generally
so
rare
and
transient
that
it
is
not
astonishing
they
should
experience
difficulty
in
assigning
men
to
their
appropriate
positions
the
judgment
of
the
prince
misled
by
appearances
may
err
and
with
the
purest
intentions
he
may
well
be
deceived
in
his
selections
one
of
the
surest
means
of
escaping
this
misfortune
would
seem
to
be
in
realizing
the
beautiful
fiction
of
fénélon
in
telemachus
by
finding
a
faithful
sincere
and
generous
philocles
who
standing
between
the
prince
and
all
aspirants
for
the
command
would
be
able
by
means
of
his
more
direct
relations
to
the
public
to
enlighten
the
monarch
in
reference
to
selections
of
individuals
best
recommended
by
their
character
and
abilities
but
will
this
faithful
friend
never
yield
to
personal
affections
will
he
be
always
free
from
prejudice
suwaroff
was
rejected
by
potemkin
on
account
of
his
appearance
and
it
required
all
the
art
of
catherine
to
secure
a
regiment
for
the
man
who
afterward
shed
so
much
luster
upon
the
russian
arms
it
has
been
thought
that
public
opinion
is
the
best
guide
but
nothing
could
be
more
dangerous
it
voted
dumouriez
to
be
a
cæsar
when
he
was
ignorant
of
the
great
operations
of
war
would
it
have
placed
bonaparte
at
the
head
of
the
army
of
italy
when
he
was
known
only
by
two
directors
still
it
must
be
admitted
that
if
not
infallible
public
sentiment
is
not
to
be
despised
particularly
if
it
survive
great
crises
and
the
experience
of
events
the
most
essential
qualities
for
a
general
will
always
be
as
follow
first
high
moral
courage
capable
of
great
secondly
physical
courage
which
takes
no
account
of
his
scientific
or
military
acquirements
are
secondary
to
the
characteristics
though
if
great
they
will
be
valuable
auxiliaries
it
is
not
necessary
that
he
should
be
a
man
of
vast
erudition
his
knowledge
may
be
limited
but
it
should
be
thorough
and
he
should
be
perfectly
grounded
in
the
principles
at
the
base
of
the
art
of
war
next
in
importance
come
the
qualities
of
his
personal
character
a
man
who
is
gallant
just
firm
upright
capable
of
esteeming
merit
in
others
instead
of
being
jealous
of
it
and
skillful
in
making
this
merit
conduce
to
his
own
glory
will
always
be
a
good
general
and
may
even
pass
for
a
great
man
unfortunately
the
disposition
to
do
justice
to
merit
in
others
is
not
the
most
common
quality
mediocre
minds
are
always
jealous
and
inclined
to
surround
themselves
with
persons
of
little
ability
fearing
the
reputation
of
being
led
and
not
realizing
that
the
nominal
commander
of
an
army
always
receives
almost
all
the
glory
of
its
success
even
when
least
entitled
to
it
the
question
has
often
been
discussed
whether
it
is
preferable
to
assign
to
the
command
a
general
of
long
experience
in
service
with
troops
or
an
officer
of
the
staff
having
generally
but
little
experience
in
the
management
of
troops
it
is
beyond
question
that
war
is
a
distinct
science
of
itself
and
that
it
is
quite
possible
to
be
able
to
combine
operations
skillfully
without
ever
having
led
a
regiment
against
an
enemy
peter
the
great
condé
frederick
and
napoleon
are
instances
of
it
it
can
not
then
be
denied
that
an
officer
from
the
staff
may
as
well
as
any
other
prove
to
be
a
great
general
but
it
will
not
be
because
he
has
grown
gray
in
the
duties
of
a
quartermaster
that
he
will
be
capable
of
the
supreme
command
but
because
he
has
a
natural
genius
for
war
and
possesses
the
requisite
characteristics
so
also
a
general
from
the
ranks
of
the
infantry
or
cavalry
may
be
as
capable
of
conducting
a
campaign
as
the
most
profound
tactician
so
this
question
does
not
admit
of
a
definite
answer
either
in
the
affirmative
or
negative
since
almost
all
will
depend
upon
the
personal
qualities
of
the
individuals
but
the
following
remarks
will
be
useful
in
leading
to
a
rational
conclusion
a
general
selected
from
the
general
staff
engineers
or
artillery
who
has
commanded
a
division
or
a
corps
will
with
equal
chances
be
superior
to
one
who
is
familiar
with
the
service
of
but
one
arm
or
special
corps
a
general
from
the
line
who
has
made
a
study
of
the
science
of
war
will
be
equally
fitted
for
the
command
that
the
character
of
the
man
is
above
all
other
requisites
in
a
finally
he
will
be
a
good
general
in
whom
are
found
united
the
requisite
personal
characteristics
and
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
the
art
of
war
the
difficulty
of
always
selecting
a
good
general
has
led
to
the
formation
of
a
good
general
staff
which
being
near
the
general
may
advise
him
and
thus
exercise
a
beneficial
influence
over
the
operations
a
general
staff
is
one
of
the
most
useful
of
organizations
but
care
must
be
observed
to
prevent
the
introduction
into
it
of
false
principles
as
in
this
case
it
might
prove
fatal
frederick
when
he
established
the
military
school
of
potsdam
never
thought
it
would
lead
to
the
right
shoulder
forward
of
general
ruchel
and
to
the
teaching
that
the
oblique
order
is
the
infallible
rule
for
gaining
all
battles
how
true
it
is
that
there
is
but
a
step
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
moreover
there
ought
to
exist
perfect
harmony
between
the
general
and
his
chief
of
staff
and
if
it
be
true
that
the
latter
should
be
a
man
of
recognized
ability
it
is
also
proper
to
give
the
general
the
choice
of
the
men
who
are
to
be
his
advisers
to
impose
a
chief
of
staff
upon
a
general
would
be
to
create
anarchy
and
want
of
harmony
while
to
permit
him
to
select
a
cipher
for
that
position
would
be
still
more
dangerous
for
if
he
be
himself
a
man
of
little
ability
indebted
to
favor
or
fortune
for
his
station
the
selection
will
be
of
vital
importance
the
best
means
to
avoid
these
dangers
is
to
give
the
general
the
option
of
several
designated
officers
all
of
undoubted
ability
it
has
been
thought
in
succession
in
almost
all
armies
that
frequent
councils
of
war
by
aiding
the
commander
with
their
advice
give
more
weight
and
effect
to
the
direction
of
military
operations
doubtless
if
the
commander
were
a
soubise
a
clermont
or
a
mack
he
might
well
find
in
a
council
of
war
opinions
more
valuable
than
his
own
the
majority
of
the
opinions
given
might
be
preferable
to
his
but
what
success
could
be
expected
from
operations
conducted
by
others
than
those
who
have
originated
and
arranged
them
what
must
be
the
result
of
an
operation
which
is
but
partially
understood
by
the
commander
since
it
is
not
his
own
conception
i
have
undergone
a
pitiable
experience
as
prompter
at
and
no
one
has
a
better
appreciation
of
the
value
of
such
services
than
myself
and
it
is
particularly
in
a
council
of
war
that
such
a
part
is
absurd
the
greater
the
number
and
the
higher
the
rank
of
the
military
officers
who
compose
the
council
the
more
difficult
will
it
be
to
accomplish
the
triumph
of
truth
and
reason
however
small
be
the
amount
of
dissent
what
would
have
been
the
action
of
a
council
of
war
to
which
napoleon
proposed
the
movement
of
arcola
the
crossing
of
the
the
maneuver
at
ulm
or
that
at
gera
and
jena
the
timid
would
have
regarded
them
as
rash
even
to
madness
others
would
have
seen
a
thousand
difficulties
of
execution
and
all
would
have
concurred
in
rejecting
them
and
if
on
the
contrary
they
had
been
adopted
and
had
been
executed
by
any
one
but
napoleon
would
they
not
certainly
have
proved
failures
in
my
opinion
councils
of
war
are
a
deplorable
resource
and
can
be
useful
only
when
concurring
in
opinion
with
the
commander
in
which
case
they
may
give
him
more
confidence
in
his
own
judgment
and
in
addition
may
assure
him
that
his
lieutenants
being
of
his
opinion
will
use
every
means
to
insure
the
success
of
the
movement
this
is
the
only
advantage
of
a
council
of
war
which
moreover
should
be
simply
consultative
and
have
no
further
authority
but
if
instead
of
this
harmony
there
should
be
difference
of
opinion
it
can
only
produce
unfortunate
results
accordingly
i
think
it
safe
to
conclude
that
the
best
means
of
organizing
the
command
of
an
army
in
default
of
a
general
approved
by
experience
is
to
give
the
command
to
a
man
of
tried
bravery
bold
in
the
fight
and
of
unshaken
firmness
in
danger
to
assign
as
his
chief
of
staff
a
man
of
high
ability
of
open
and
faithful
character
between
whom
and
the
commander
there
may
be
perfect
harmony
the
victor
will
gain
so
much
glory
that
he
can
spare
some
to
the
friend
who
has
contributed
to
his
success
in
this
way
blücher
aided
by
gneisenau
and
muffling
gained
glory
which
probably
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
do
of
himself
it
is
true
that
this
double
command
is
more
objectionable
than
an
undivided
one
when
a
state
has
a
napoleon
a
frederick
or
a
suwaroff
to
fill
it
but
when
there
is
no
great
general
to
lead
the
armies
it
is
certainly
the
preferable
system
before
leaving
this
important
branch
of
the
subject
another
means
of
influencing
military
operations
viz
that
of
a
council
of
war
at
the
seat
of
government
deserves
notice
louvois
for
a
long
time
directed
from
paris
the
armies
of
louis
and
with
success
carnot
also
from
paris
directed
the
armies
of
the
republic
in
he
did
well
and
saved
france
in
his
action
was
at
first
very
unfortunate
but
he
repaired
his
faults
afterward
by
chance
in
he
was
completely
at
fault
it
is
to
be
observed
however
that
both
louvois
and
carnot
individually
controlled
the
armies
and
that
there
was
no
council
of
war
the
aulic
council
sitting
in
vienna
was
often
intrusted
with
the
duty
of
directing
the
operations
of
the
armies
and
there
has
never
been
but
one
opinion
in
europe
as
to
its
fatal
influence
whether
this
opinion
is
right
or
wrong
the
austrian
generals
alone
are
able
to
decide
my
own
opinion
is
that
the
functions
of
such
a
body
in
this
connection
should
be
limited
to
the
adoption
of
a
general
plan
of
operations
by
this
i
do
not
mean
a
plan
which
should
trace
out
the
campaign
in
detail
restricting
the
generals
and
compelling
them
to
give
battle
without
regard
to
circumstances
but
a
plan
which
should
determine
the
object
of
the
campaign
the
nature
of
the
operations
whether
offensive
or
defensive
the
material
means
to
be
applied
to
these
first
enterprises
afterward
for
the
reserves
and
finally
for
the
levies
which
may
be
necessary
if
the
country
be
invaded
these
points
it
is
true
should
be
discussed
in
a
council
of
both
generals
and
ministers
and
to
these
points
should
the
control
of
the
council
be
limited
for
if
it
should
not
only
order
the
general
in
command
to
march
to
vienna
or
to
paris
but
should
also
have
the
presumption
to
indicate
the
manner
in
which
he
should
maneuver
to
attain
this
object
the
unfortunate
general
would
certainly
be
beaten
and
the
whole
responsibility
of
his
reverses
should
fall
upon
the
shoulders
of
those
who
hundreds
of
miles
distant
took
upon
themselves
the
duty
of
directing
the
army
a
duty
so
difficult
for
any
one
even
upon
the
scene
of
operations

general
ruchel

at

that

the
military
spirit
of
nations
and
the
morale
of
armies
the
adoption
of
the
best
regulations
for
the
organization
of
an
army
would
be
in
vain
if
the
government
did
not
at
the
same
time
cultivate
a
military
spirit
in
its
citizens
it
may
well
be
the
case
in
london
situated
on
an
island
and
protected
from
invasion
by
its
immense
fleets
that
the
title
of
a
rich
banker
should
be
preferred
to
a
military
decoration
but
a
continental
nation
imbued
with
the
sentiments
and
habits
of
the
tradesmen
of
london
or
the
bankers
of
paris
would
sooner
or
later
fall
a
prey
to
its
neighbors
it
was
to
the
union
of
the
civic
virtues
and
military
spirit
fostered
by
their
institutions
that
the
romans
were
indebted
for
their
grandeur
and
when
they
lost
these
virtues
and
when
no
longer
regarding
the
military
service
as
an
honor
as
well
as
a
duty
they
relinquished
it
to
mercenary
goths
and
gauls
the
fall
of
the
empire
became
inevitable
it
is
doubtless
true
that
whatever
increases
the
prosperity
of
the
country
should
be
neither
neglected
nor
despised
it
is
also
necessary
to
honor
the
branches
of
industry
which
are
the
first
instruments
of
this
prosperity
but
they
should
always
be
secondary
to
the
great
institutions
which
make
up
the
strength
of
states
in
encouraging
the
cultivation
of
the
manly
and
heroic
virtues
policy
and
justice
both
agree
on
this
point
for
whatever
boileau
may
say
it
is
certainly
more
glorious
to
confront
death
in
the
footsteps
of
the
cæsars
than
to
fatten
upon
the
public
miseries
by
gambling
on
the
vicissitudes
of
the
national
credit
misfortune
will
certainly
fall
upon
the
land
where
the
wealth
of
the
or
the
greedy
gambler
in
stocks
stands
in
public
estimation
above
the
uniform
of
the
brave
man
who
sacrifices
his
life
health
or
fortune
to
the
defense
of
his
country
the
first
means
of
encouraging
the
military
spirit
is
to
invest
the
army
with
all
possible
social
and
public
consideration
the
second
means
is
to
give
the
preference
to
those
who
have
rendered
services
to
the
state
in
filling
any
vacancies
in
the
administrative
departments
of
the
government
or
even
to
require
a
certain
length
of
military
service
as
a
qualification
for
certain
offices
a
comparison
of
the
ancient
military
institutions
of
rome
with
those
of
russia
and
prussia
is
a
subject
worthy
of
serious
attention
and
it
would
also
be
interesting
to
contrast
them
with
the
doctrines
of
modern
theorists
who
declare
against
the
employment
of
officers
of
the
army
in
other
public
functions
and
who
wish
for
none
but
rhetoricians
in
the
important
offices
of
administration
it
is
true
that
many
public
employments
demand
a
special
course
of
study
but
can
not
the
soldier
in
the
abundant
leisure
of
peace
prepare
himself
for
the
career
he
would
prefer
after
having
fulfilled
his
debt
to
his
country
in
the
profession
of
arms
if
these
administrative
offices
were
conferred
upon
officers
retired
from
the
army
in
a
grade
not
lower
than
that
of
captain
would
it
not
be
a
stimulant
for
officers
to
attain
that
rank
and
would
it
not
lead
them
when
in
garrisons
to
find
their
recreations
elsewhere
than
in
the
theaters
and
public
clubs
it
may
be
possible
that
this
facility
of
transfer
from
the
military
to
the
civil
service
would
be
rather
injurious
than
favorable
to
a
high
military
spirit
and
that
to
encourage
this
spirit
it
would
be
expedient
to
place
the
profession
of
the
soldier
above
all
others
this
was
the
early
practice
of
the
mamelukes
and
janissaries
their
soldiers
were
bought
at
the
age
of
about
seven
years
and
were
educated
in
the
idea
that
they
were
to
die
by
their
standards
even
the
english
so
jealous
of
their
rights
contract
in
enlisting
as
soldiers
the
obligation
for
the
whole
length
of
their
lives
and
the
russian
in
enlisting
for
years
does
what
is
almost
equivalent
in
such
armies
and
in
those
recruited
by
voluntary
enlistments
perhaps
it
would
not
be
advisable
to
tolerate
this
fusion
of
military
and
civil
offices
but
where
the
military
service
is
a
temporary
duty
imposed
upon
the
people
the
case
is
different
and
the
old
roman
laws
which
required
a
previous
military
service
of
ten
years
in
any
aspirant
for
the
public
employments
seem
to
be
best
calculated
to
preserve
the
military
spirit
particularly
in
this
age
when
the
attainment
of
material
comfort
and
prosperity
appears
to
be
the
dominant
passion
of
the
people
however
this
may
be
still
in
my
opinion
under
all
forms
of
government
it
will
be
a
wise
part
to
honor
the
military
profession
in
order
to
encourage
the
love
of
glory
and
all
the
warlike
virtues
under
the
penalty
of
receiving
the
reproaches
of
posterity
and
suffering
insult
and
dependency
it
is
not
sufficient
to
foster
the
military
spirit
among
the
people
but
more
than
that
it
is
necessary
to
encourage
it
in
the
army
of
what
avail
would
it
be
if
the
uniform
be
honored
in
the
land
and
it
be
regarded
as
a
duty
to
serve
in
the
army
while
the
military
virtues
are
wanting
the
forces
would
be
numerous
but
without
valor
the
enthusiasm
of
an
army
and
its
military
spirit
are
two
quite
different
things
and
should
not
be
confounded
although
they
produce
the
same
effects
the
first
is
the
effect
of
passions
more
or
less
of
a
temporary
character
of
a
political
or
religious
nature
for
instance
or
of
a
great
love
of
country
while
the
latter
depending
upon
the
skill
of
the
commander
and
resulting
from
military
institutions
is
more
permanent
and
depends
less
upon
circumstances
and
should
be
the
object
of
the
attention
of
every
government
courage
should
be
recompensed
and
honored
the
different
grades
in
rank
respected
and
discipline
should
exist
in
the
sentiments
and
convictions
rather
than
in
external
forms
only
the
officers
should
feel
the
conviction
that
resignation
bravery
and
faithful
attention
to
duty
are
virtues
without
which
no
glory
is
possible
no
army
is
respectable
and
that
firmness
amid
reverses
is
more
honorable
than
enthusiasm
in
success
since
courage
alone
is
necessary
to
storm
a
position
while
it
requires
heroism
to
make
a
difficult
retreat
before
a
victorious
and
enterprising
enemy
always
opposing
to
him
a
firm
and
unbroken
front
a
fine
retreat
should
meet
with
a
reward
equal
to
that
given
for
a
great
victory
by
inuring
armies
to
labor
and
fatigue
by
keeping
them
from
stagnation
in
garrison
in
times
of
peace
by
inculcating
their
superiority
over
their
enemies
without
depreciating
too
much
the
latter
by
inspiring
a
love
for
great
exploits
in
a
word
by
exciting
their
enthusiasm
by
every
means
in
harmony
with
their
tone
of
mind
by
honoring
courage
punishing
weakness
and
disgracing
cowardice
we
may
expect
to
maintain
a
high
military
spirit
effeminacy
was
the
chief
cause
of
the
ruin
of
the
roman
legions
those
formidable
soldiers
who
had
borne
the
casque
buckler
and
cuirass
in
the
times
of
the
scipios
under
the
burning
sun
of
africa
found
them
too
heavy
in
the
cool
climates
of
germany
and
gaul
and
then
the
empire
was
lost
i
have
remarked
that
it
is
not
well
to
create
a
too
great
contempt
for
the
enemy
lest
the
of
the
soldier
should
be
shaken
if
he
encounter
an
obstinate
resistance
napoleon
at
jena
addressing
troops
praised
the
prussian
cavalry
but
promised
that
they
would
contend
in
vain
against
the
bayonets
of
his
egyptians
the
officers
and
troops
must
be
warned
against
those
sudden
panics
which
often
seize
the
bravest
armies
when
they
are
not
well
controlled
by
discipline
and
hence
when
they
do
not
recognize
that
in
order
is
the
surest
hope
of
safety
it
was
not
from
want
of
courage
that
one
hundred
thousand
turks
were
beaten
at
peterwardein
by
prince
eugene
and
at
kagoul
by
romanzoff
it
was
because
once
repulsed
in
their
disorderly
charges
every
one
yielded
to
his
personal
feelings
and
because
they
fought
individually
but
not
in
masses
and
in
order
an
army
seized
with
panic
is
similarly
in
a
state
of
demoralization
because
when
disorder
is
once
introduced
all
concerted
action
on
the
part
of
individuals
becomes
impossible
the
voice
of
the
officers
can
no
longer
be
heard
no
maneuver
for
resuming
the
battle
can
be
executed
and
there
is
no
resource
but
in
ignominious
flight
nations
with
powerful
imaginations
are
particularly
liable
to
panics
and
nothing
short
of
strong
institutions
and
skillful
leaders
can
remedy
it
even
the
french
whose
military
virtues
when
well
led
have
never
been
questioned
have
often
performed
some
quick
movements
of
this
kind
which
were
highly
ridiculous
we
may
refer
to
the
unbecoming
panic
which
pervaded
the
infantry
of
marshal
villars
after
having
gained
the
battle
of
friedlingen
in
the
same
occurred
to
napoleon
infantry
after
the
victory
of
wagram
and
when
the
enemy
was
in
full
retreat
a
still
more
extraordinary
case
was
the
flight
of
the
fifteen
hundred
strong
at
the
siege
of
genoa
before
a
platoon
of
cavalry
two
days
afterward
these
same
men
took
fort
diamond
by
one
of
the
most
vigorous
assaults
mentioned
in
modern
history
still
it
would
seem
to
be
easy
to
convince
brave
men
that
death
comes
more
quickly
and
more
surely
to
those
who
fly
in
disorder
than
to
those
who
remain
together
and
present
a
firm
front
to
the
enemy
or
who
rally
promptly
when
their
lines
have
been
for
the
instant
broken
in
this
respect
the
russian
army
may
be
taken
as
a
model
by
all
others
the
firmness
which
it
has
displayed
in
all
retreats
is
due
in
equal
degrees
to
the
national
character
the
natural
instincts
of
the
soldiers
and
the
excellent
disciplinary
institutions
indeed
vivacity
of
imagination
is
not
always
the
cause
of
the
introduction
of
disorder
the
want
of
the
habit
of
order
often
causes
it
and
the
lack
of
precautions
on
the
part
of
the
generals
to
maintain
this
order
contributes
to
it
i
have
often
been
astonished
at
the
indifference
of
most
generals
on
this
point
not
only
did
they
not
deign
to
take
the
slightest
precaution
to
give
the
proper
direction
to
small
detachments
or
scattered
men
and
fail
to
adopt
any
signals
to
facilitate
the
rallying
in
each
division
of
the
fractions
which
may
be
scattered
in
a
momentary
panic
or
in
an
irresistible
charge
of
the
enemy
but
they
were
offended
that
any
one
should
think
of
proposing
such
precautions
still
the
most
undoubted
courage
and
the
most
severe
discipline
will
often
be
powerless
to
remedy
a
great
disorder
which
might
be
in
a
great
degree
obviated
by
the
use
of
for
the
different
divisions
there
are
it
is
true
cases
where
all
human
resources
are
insufficient
for
the
maintenance
of
order
as
when
the
physical
sufferings
of
the
soldiers
have
been
so
great
as
to
render
them
deaf
to
all
appeals
and
when
their
officers
find
it
impossible
to
do
any
thing
to
organize
them
which
was
the
case
in
the
retreat
of
leaving
out
these
exceptional
cases
good
habits
of
order
good
logistical
precautions
for
rallying
and
good
discipline
will
most
frequently
be
successful
if
not
in
preventing
disorder
at
least
in
promptly
remedying
it
it
is
now
time
to
leave
this
branch
of
which
i
have
only
desired
to
trace
an
outline
and
to
proceed
to
the
examination
of
subjects
which
are
purely
military
footnotes
footnote
for
instance
in
france
instead
of
excluding
all
officers
from
the
privilege
of
the
elective
franchise
it
should
be
given
to
all
colonels
and
the
generals
should
be
eligible
to
the
legislature
the
most
venal
deputies
will
not
be
those
from
military
life
footnote
it
is
particularly
important
that
this
spirit
should
pervade
the
officers
and
officers
if
they
be
capable
and
the
nation
brave
there
need
be
no
fear
for
the
men
chapter
iii
strategy
definition
of
strategy
and
the
fundamental
principle
of
war
the
art
of
war
independently
of
its
political
and
moral
relations
consists
of
five
principal
parts
viz
strategy
grand
tactics
logistics
tactics
of
the
different
arms
and
the
art
of
the
engineer
we
will
treat
of
the
first
three
branches
and
begin
by
defining
them
in
order
to
do
this
we
will
follow
the
order
of
procedure
of
a
general
when
war
is
first
declared
who
commences
with
the
points
of
the
highest
importance
as
a
plan
of
campaign
and
afterward
descends
to
the
necessary
details
tactics
on
the
contrary
begins
with
details
and
ascends
to
combinations
and
generalization
necessary
for
the
formation
and
handling
of
a
great
army
we
will
suppose
an
army
taking
the
field
the
first
care
of
its
commander
should
be
to
agree
with
the
head
of
the
state
upon
the
character
of
the
war
then
he
must
carefully
study
the
theater
of
war
and
select
the
most
suitable
base
of
operations
taking
into
consideration
the
frontiers
of
the
state
and
those
of
its
allies
the
selection
of
this
base
and
the
proposed
aim
will
determine
the
zone
of
operations
the
general
will
take
a
first
objective
point
he
will
select
the
line
of
operations
leading
to
this
point
either
as
a
temporary
or
permanent
line
giving
it
the
most
advantageous
direction
namely
that
which
promises
the
greatest
number
of
favorable
opportunities
with
the
least
danger
an
army
marching
on
this
line
of
operations
will
have
a
front
of
operations
and
a
strategic
front
the
temporary
positions
which
the
corps
will
occupy
upon
this
front
of
operations
or
upon
the
line
of
defense
will
be
strategic
positions
when
near
its
first
objective
point
and
when
it
begins
to
meet
resistance
the
army
will
either
attack
the
enemy
or
maneuver
to
compel
him
to
retreat
and
for
this
end
it
will
adopt
one
or
two
strategic
lines
of
maneuvers
which
being
temporary
may
deviate
to
a
certain
degree
from
the
general
line
of
operations
with
which
they
must
not
be
confounded
to
connect
the
strategic
front
with
the
base
as
the
advance
is
made
lines
of
supply
depots
will
be
established
if
the
line
of
operations
be
long
and
there
be
hostile
troops
in
annoying
proximity
to
it
these
bodies
may
either
be
attacked
and
dispersed
or
be
merely
observed
or
the
operations
against
the
enemy
may
be
carried
on
without
reference
to
them
if
the
second
of
these
courses
be
pursued
a
double
strategic
front
and
large
detachments
will
be
the
result
the
army
being
almost
within
reach
of
the
first
objective
point
if
the
enemy
oppose
him
there
will
be
a
battle
if
indecisive
the
fight
will
be
resumed
if
the
army
gains
the
victory
it
will
secure
its
objective
point
or
will
advance
to
attain
a
second
should
the
first
objective
point
be
the
possession
of
an
important
fort
the
siege
will
be
commenced
if
the
army
be
not
strong
enough
to
continue
its
march
after
detaching
a
sufficient
force
to
maintain
the
siege
it
will
take
a
strategic
position
to
cover
it
as
did
the
army
of
italy
in
which
less
than
fifty
thousand
strong
could
not
pass
mantua
to
enter
austria
leaving
thousand
enemies
within
its
walls
and
having
forty
thousand
more
in
front
on
the
double
line
of
the
tyrol
and
frioul
if
the
army
be
strong
enough
to
make
the
best
use
of
its
victory
or
if
it
have
no
siege
to
make
it
will
operate
toward
a
second
and
more
important
objective
point
if
this
point
be
distant
it
will
be
necessary
to
establish
an
intermediate
point
of
support
one
or
more
secure
cities
already
occupied
will
form
an
eventual
base
when
this
can
not
be
done
a
small
strategic
reserve
may
be
established
which
will
protect
the
rear
and
also
the
depots
by
temporary
fortifications
when
the
army
crosses
large
streams
it
will
construct
de
and
if
the
bridges
are
within
walled
cities
will
be
thrown
up
to
increase
the
means
of
defense
and
to
secure
the
safety
of
the
eventual
base
or
the
strategic
reserve
which
may
occupy
these
posts
should
the
battle
be
lost
the
army
will
retreat
toward
its
base
in
order
to
be
reinforced
therefrom
by
detachments
of
troops
or
what
is
equivalent
to
strengthen
itself
by
the
occupation
of
fortified
posts
and
camps
thus
compelling
the
enemy
to
halt
or
to
divide
his
forces
when
winter
approaches
the
armies
will
either
go
into
quarters
or
the
field
will
be
kept
by
the
army
which
has
obtained
decisive
success
and
is
desirous
of
profiting
to
the
utmost
by
its
superiority
these
winter
campaigns
are
very
trying
to
both
armies
but
in
other
respects
do
not
differ
from
ordinary
campaigns
unless
it
be
in
demanding
increased
activity
and
energy
to
attain
prompt
success
such
is
the
ordinary
course
of
a
war
and
as
such
we
will
consider
it
while
discussing
combinations
which
result
from
these
operations
strategy
embraces
the
following
points
viz
the
selection
of
the
theater
of
war
and
the
discussion
of
the
different
combinations
of
which
it
admits
the
determination
of
the
decisive
points
in
these
combinations
and
the
most
favorable
direction
for
operations
the
selection
and
establishment
of
the
fixed
base
and
of
the
zone
of
operations
the
selection
of
the
objective

offensive
or

operation
the

and
the
different
maneuvers
necessary
to
embrace
all
possible
cases
the
eventual
bases
of
operations
and
the
strategic
reserves
the
marches
of
armies
considered
as
maneuvers
the

between
the

and
to

covered
points
for
intrenched

the
diversions
to
be
made
and
the
large
detachments
necessary
these
points
are
principally
of
importance
in
the
determination
of
the
first
steps
of
a
campaign
but
there
are
other
operations
of
a
mixed
nature
such
as
passages
of
streams
retreats
surprises
disembarkations
convoys
winter
quarters
the
execution

which
belongs

it
is
true
that
many
battles
have
been
decided
by
strategic
movements
and
have
been
indeed
but
a
succession
of
them
but
this
only
occurs
in
the
exceptional
case
of
a
dispersed
army
for
the
general

of
pitched
battles
the

accomplished
by

or
single
division
may
be
regarded
as
details
of
war
and
not
included
in
the
great
operations
the
fundamental
principle
of
war
it
is
proposed
to
show
that
there
is
one
great
principle
underlying
all
the
operations
of
war
a
principle
which
must
be
followed
in
all
good
combinations
it
is
embraced
in
the
following
maxims
to
throw
by
strategic
movements
the
mass
of
an
army
successively
upon
the
decisive
points
of
a
theater
of
war
and
also
upon
the
communications
of
the
enemy
as
much
as
possible
without
compromising
one
own
to
maneuver
to
engage
fractions
of
the
hostile
army
with
the
bulk
of
one
forces
on
the
to
throw
the
mass
of
the
forces
upon
the
decisive
point
or
upon
that
portion
of
the
hostile
line
which
it
is
of
the
first
importance
to
overthrow
to
so
arrange
that
these
masses
shall
not
only
be
thrown
upon
the
decisive
point
but
that
they
shall
engage
at
the
proper
times
and
with
energy
this
principle
has
too
much
simplicity
to
escape
criticism
one
objection
is
that
it
is
easy
to
recommend
throwing
the
mass
of
the
forces
upon
the
decisive
points
but
that
the
difficulty
lies
in
recognizing
those
points
this
truth
is
evident
and
it
would
be
little
short
of
the
ridiculous
to
enunciate
such
a
general
principle
without
accompanying
it
with
all
necessary
explanations
for
its
application
upon
the
field
in
article
xix
these
decisive
points
will
be
described
and
in
articles
from
xviii
to
xxii
will
be
discussed
their
relations
to
the
different
combinations
those
students
who
having
attentively
considered
what
is
there
stated
still
regard
the
determination
of
these
points
as
a
problem
without
a
solution
may
well
despair
of
ever
comprehending
strategy
the
general
theater
of
operations
seldom
contains
more
than
three
zones
the
right
the
left
and
the
center
and
each
zone
front
of
operations
strategic
position
and
line
of
defense
as
well
as
each
line
of
battle
has
the
same
subdivisions
two
extremities
and
the
center
a
direction
upon
one
of
these
three
will
always
be
suitable
for
the
attainment
of
the
desired
end
a
direction
upon
one
of
the
two
remaining
will
be
less
advantageous
while
the
third
direction
will
be
wholly
inapplicable
in
considering
the
object
proposed
in
connection
with
the
positions
of
the
enemy
and
the
geography
of
the
country
it
will
appear
that
in
every
strategic
movement
or
tactical
maneuver
the
question
for
decision
will
always
be
whether
to
maneuver
to
the
right
to
the
left
or
directly
in
front
the
selection
of
one
of
these
three
simple
alternatives
can
not
surely
be
considered
an
enigma
the
art
of
giving
the
proper
direction
to
the
masses
is
certainly
the
basis
of
strategy
although
it
is
not
the
whole
of
the
art
of
war
executive
talent
skill
energy
and
a
quick
apprehension
of
events
are
necessary
to
carry
out
any
combinations
previously
arranged
we
will
apply
this
great
principle
to
the
different
cases
of
strategy
and
tactics
and
then
show
by
the
history
of
twenty
celebrated
campaigns
that
with
few
exceptions
the
most
brilliant
successes
and
the
greatest
reverses
resulted
from
an
adherence
to
this
principle
in
the
one
case
and
from
a
neglect
of
it
in
the
other
of
strategic
combinations
article
xvi
of
the
system
of
operations
war
once
determined
upon
the
first
point
to
be
decided
is
whether
it
shall
be
offensive
or
defensive
and
we
will
first
explain
what
is
meant
by
these
terms
there
are
several
phases
of
the
offensive
if
against
a
great
state
the
whole
or
a
large
portion
of
whose
territory
is
attacked
it
is
an
if
a
province
only
or
a
line
of
defense
of
moderate
extent
be
assailed
it
is
the
ordinary
offensive
finally
if
the
offensive
is
but
an
attack
upon
the
enemy
position
and
is
confined
to
a
single
operation
it
is
called
the
taking
the
in
a
moral
and
political
view
the
offensive
is
nearly
always
advantageous
it
carries
the
war
upon
foreign
soil
saves
the
assailant
country
from
devastation
increases
his
resources
and
diminishes
those
of
his
enemy
elevates
the
of
his
army
and
generally
depresses
the
adversary
it
sometimes
happens
that
invasion
excites
the
ardor
and
energy
of
the
adversary
particularly
when
he
feels
that
the
independence
of
his
country
is
threatened
in
a
military
point
of
view
the
offensive
has
its
good
and
its
bad
side
strategically
an
invasion
leads
to
deep
lines
of
operations
which
are
always
dangerous
in
a
hostile
country
all
the
obstacles
in
the
enemy
country
the
mountains
rivers
defiles
and
forts
are
favorable
for
defense
while
the
inhabitants
and
authorities
of
the
country
so
far
from
being
the
instruments
of
the
invading
army
are
generally
hostile
however
if
success
be
obtained
the
enemy
is
struck
in
a
vital
point
he
is
deprived
of
his
resources
and
compelled
to
seek
a
speedy
termination
of
the
contest
for
a
single
operation
which
we
have
called
the
taking
the
the
offensive
is
almost
always
advantageous
particularly
in
strategy
indeed
if
the
art
of
war
consists
in
throwing
the
masses
upon
the
decisive
points
to
do
this
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
the
initiative
the
attacking
party
knows
what
he
is
doing
and
what
he
desires
to
do
he
leads
his
masses
to
the
point
where
he
desires
to
strike
he
who
awaits
the
attack
is
everywhere
anticipated
the
enemy
fall
with
large
force
upon
fractions
of
his
force
he
neither
knows
where
his
adversary
proposes
to
attack
him
nor
in
what
manner
to
repel
him
tactically
the
offensive
also
possesses
advantages
but
they
are
less
positive
since
the
operations
being
upon
a
limited
field
the
party
taking
the
initiative
can
not
conceal
them
from
the
enemy
who
may
detect
his
designs
and
by
the
aid
of
good
reserves
cause
them
to
fail
the
attacking
party
labors
under
the
disadvantages
arising
from
the
obstacles
to
be
crossed
before
reaching
the
enemy
line
on
which
account
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
tactical
offensive
are
about
equally
balanced
whatever
advantages
may
be
expected
either
politically
or
strategically
from
the
offensive
it
may
not
be
possible
to
maintain
it
exclusively
throughout
the
war
for
a
campaign
offensive
in
the
beginning
may
become
defensive
before
it
ends
a
defensive
war
is
not
without
its
advantages
when
wisely
conducted
it
may
be
passive
or
active
taking
the
offensive
at
times
the
passive
defense
is
always
pernicious
the
active
may
accomplish
great
successes
the
object
of
a
defensive
war
being
to
protect
as
long
as
possible
the
country
threatened
by
the
enemy
all
operations
should
be
designed
to
retard
his
progress
to
annoy
him
in
his
enterprises
by
multiplying
obstacles
and
difficulties
without
however
compromising
one
own
army
he
who
invades
does
so
by
reason
of
some
superiority
he
will
then
seek
to
make
the
issue
as
promptly
as
possible
the
defense
on
the
contrary
desires
delay
till
his
adversary
is
weakened
by
sending
off
detachments
by
marches
and
by
the
privations
and
fatigues
incident
to
his
progress
an
army
is
reduced
to
the
defensive
only
by
reverses
or
by
a
positive
inferiority
it
then
seeks
in
the
support
of
forts
and
in
natural
or
artificial
barriers
the
means
of
restoring
equality
by
multiplying
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
enemy
this
plan
when
not
carried
to
an
extreme
promises
many
chances
of
success
but
only
when
the
general
has
the
good
sense
not
to
make
the
defense
passive
he
must
not
remain
in
his
positions
to
receive
whatever
blows
may
be
given
by
his
adversary
he
must
on
the
contrary
redouble
his
activity
and
be
constantly
upon
the
alert
to
improve
all
opportunities
of
assailing
the
weak
points
of
the
enemy
this
plan
of
war
may
be
called
the
and
may
have
strategical
as
well
as
tactical
it
combines
the
advantages
of
both
systems
for
one
who
awaits
his
adversary
upon
a
prepared
field
with
all
his
own
resources
in
hand
surrounded
by
all
the
advantages
of
being
on
his
own
ground
can
with
hope
of
success
take
the
initiative
and
is
fully
able
to
judge
when
and
where
to
strike
during
the
first
three
campaigns
of
the
seven
years
war
frederick
was
the
assailant
in
the
remaining
four
his
conduct
was
a
perfect
model
of
the
he
was
however
wonderfully
aided
in
this
by
his
adversaries
who
allowed
him
all
the
time
he
desired
and
many
opportunities
of
taking
the
offensive
with
success
wellington
course
was
mainly
the
same
in
portugal
spain
and
belgium
and
it
was
the
most
suitable
in
his
circumstances
it
seems
plain
that
one
of
the
greatest
talents
of
a
general
is
to
know
how
to
use
it
may
be
alternately
these
two
systems
and
particularly
to
be
able
to
take
the
initiative
during
the
progress
of
a
defensive
war
article

of
the
theater
of
operations
the
theater
of
a
war
comprises
all
the
territory
upon
which
the
parties
may
assail
each
other
whether
it
belong
to
themselves
their
allies
or
to
weaker
states
who
may
be
drawn
into
the
war
through
fear
or
interest
when
the
war
is
also
maritime
the
theater
may
embrace
both
hemispheres
as
has
happened
in
contests
between
france
and
england
since
the
time
of
louis
xiv
the
theater
of
a
war
may
thus
be
undefined
and
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
theater
of
operations
of
one
or
the
other
army
the
theater
of
a
continental
war
between
france
and
austria
may
be
confined
to
italy
or
may
in
addition
comprise
germany
if
the
german
states
take
part
therein
armies
may
act
in
concert
or
separately
in
the
first
case
the
whole
theater
of
operations
may
be
considered
as
a
single
field
upon
which
strategy
directs
the
armies
for
the
attainment
of
a
definite
end
in
the
second
case
each
army
will
have
its
own
independent
theater
of
operations
the
of
of
an
army
embraces
all
the
territory
it
may
desire
to
invade
and
all
that
it
may
be
necessary
to
defend
if
the
army
operates
independently
it
should
not
attempt
any
maneuver
beyond
its
own
theater
though
it
should
leave
it
if
it
be
in
danger
of
being
surrounded
since
the
supposition
is
that
no
concert
of
action
has
been
arranged
with
the
armies
operating
on
the
other
fields
if
on
the
contrary
there
be
concert
of
action
the
theater
of
operations
of
each
army
taken
singly
is
but
a
zone
of
operations
of
the
general
field
occupied
by
the
masses
for
the
attainment
of
a
common
object
independently
of
its
topographical
features
each
theater
upon
which
one
or
more
armies
operate
is
composed
for
both
parties
as
follows
of
a
fixed
base
of
operations
of
a
principal
objective
point
of
fronts
of
operations
strategic
fronts
and
lines
of
defense
of
zones
and
lines
of
operations
of
temporary
strategic
lines
and
lines
of
communications
of
natural
or
artificial
obstacles
to
be
overcome
or
to
oppose
to
the
enemy
of
geographical
strategic
points
whose
occupation
is
important
either
for
the
offensive
or
defensive
of
accidental
intermediate
bases
of
operations
between
the
objective
point
and
the
primary
base
of
points
of
refuge
in
case
of
reverse
for
illustration
let
us
suppose
the
case
of
france
invading
austria
with
two
or
three
armies
to
be
concentrated
under
one
commander
and
starting
from
mayence
from
the
upper
rhine
from
savoy
or
the
maritime
alps
respectively
the
section
of
country
which
each
of
these
armies
traverses
may
be
considered
as
a
zone
of
the
general
field
of
operations
but
if
the
army
of
italy
goes
but
to
the
adige
without
concerted
action
with
the
army
of
the
rhine
then
what
was
before
but
a
zone
becomes
for
that
army
a
theater
of
operations
in
every
case
each
theater
must
have
its
own
base
its
own
objective
point
its
zones
and
lines
of
operations
connecting
the
objective
point
with
the
base
either
in
the
offensive
or
the
defensive
it
has
been
taught
and
published
that
rivers
are
lines
of
operations
now
as
such
a
line
must
possess
two
or
three
roads
to
move
the
army
within
the
range
of
its
operations
and
at
least
one
line
of
retreat
rivers
have
been
called
lines
of
retreat
and
even
lines
of
maneuver
it
would
be
much
more
accurate
to
say
that
rivers
are
excellent
lines
of
supply
and
powerful
auxiliaries
in
the
establishment
of
a
good
line
of
operations
but
never
the
line
itself
it
has
also
been
maintained
that
could
one
create
a
country
expressly
to
be
a
good
theater
of
war
converging
roads
would
be
avoided
because
they
facilitate
invasion
every
country
has
its
capital
its
rich
cities
for
manufactures
or
trade
and
in
the
very
nature
of
things
these
points
must
be
the
centers
of
converging
routes
could
germany
be
made
a
desert
to
be
molded
into
a
theater
of
war
at
the
pleasure
of
an
individual
commercial
cities
and
centers
of
trade
would
spring
up
and
the
roads
would
again
necessarily
converge
to
these
points
moreover
was
not
the
archduke
charles
enabled
to
beat
jourdan
in
by
the
use
of
converging
routes
besides
these
routes
are
more
favorable
for
defense
than
attack
since
two
divisions
retreating
upon
these
radial
lines
can
effect
a
junction
more
quickly
than
two
armies
which
are
pursuing
and
they
may
thus
united
defeat
each
of
the
pursuing
masses
separately
some
authors
have
affirmed
that
mountainous
countries
abound
in
strategic
positions
others
have
maintained
that
on
the
contrary
these
points
are
more
rare
among
the
alps
than
in
the
plains
but
also
that
if
more
rare
they
are
more
important
and
more
decisive
some
authors
have
represented
that
high
ranges
of
mountains
are
in
war
inaccessible
barriers
napoleon
on
the
contrary
in
speaking
of
the
rhetian
alps
said
that
an
army
could
pass
wherever
a
man
could
put
his
foot
generals
no
less
experienced
than
himself
in
have
united
with
him
in
this
opinion
in
admitting
the
great
difficulty
of
carrying
on
a
defensive
war
in
such
localities
unless
the
advantages
of
partisan
and
regular
warfare
can
be
combined
the
first
to
guard
the
heights
and
to
harass
the
enemy
the
second
to
give
battle
at
the
decisive
points
the
junctions
of
the
large
valleys
these
differences
of
opinion
are
here
noticed
merely
to
show
the
reader
that
so
far
from
the
art
having
reached
perfection
there
are
many
points
that
admit
of
discussion
the
most
important
topographical
or
artificial
features
which
make
up
the
theater
of
a
war
will
in
succeeding
portions
of
this
chapter
be
examined
as
to
their
strategic
value
but
here
it
may
be
proper
to
remark
that
this
value
will
depend
much
upon
the
spirit
and
skill
of
the
general
the
great
leader
who
crossed
the
and
ordered
the
passage
of
the
splugen
was
far
from
believing
in
the
impregnability
of
these
chains
but
he
was
also
far
from
thinking
that
a
muddy
rivulet
and
a
walled
inclosure
could
change
his
destiny
at
waterloo
article
xviii
bases
of
operations
a
base
of
operations
is
the
portion
of
country
from
which
the
army
obtains
its
reinforcements
and
resources
from
which
it
starts
when
it
takes
the
offensive
to
which
it
retreats
when
necessary
and
by
which
it
is
supported
when
it
takes
position
to
cover
the
country
defensively
the
base
of
operations
is
most
generally
that
of
supply
though
not
necessarily
so
at
least
as
far
as
food
is
concerned
as
for
instance
a
french
army
upon
the
elbe
might
be
subsisted
from
westphalia
or
franconia
but
its
real
base
would
certainly
be
upon
the
rhine
when
a
frontier
possesses
good
natural
or
artificial
barriers
it
may
be
alternately
either
an
excellent
base
for
offensive
operations
or
a
line
of
defense
when
the
state
is
invaded
in
the
latter
case
it
will
always
be
prudent
to
have
a
second
base
in
rear
for
although
an
army
in
its
own
country
will
everywhere
find
a
point
of
support
there
is
still
a
vast
difference
between
those
parts
of
the
country
without
military
positions
and
means
as
forts
arsenals
and
fortified
depots
and
those
other
portions
where
these
military
resources
are
found
and
these
latter
alone
can
be
considered
as
safe
bases
of
operations
an
army
may
have
in
succession
a
number
of
bases
for
instance
a
french
army
in
germany
will
have
the
rhine
for
its
first
base
it
may
have
others
beyond
this
wherever
it
has
allies
or
permanent
lines
of
defense
but
if
it
is
driven
back
across
the
rhine
it
will
have
for
a
base
either
the
meuse
or
the
moselle
it
might
have
a
third
upon
the
seine
and
a
fourth
upon
the
loire
these
successive
bases
may
not
be
entirely
or
nearly
parallel
to
the
first
on
the
contrary
a
total
change
of
direction
may
become
necessary
a
french
army
repulsed
beyond
the
rhine
might
find
a
good
base
on
béfort
or
besançon
on
mézières
or
sedan
as
the
russian
army
after
the
evacuation
of
moscow
left
the
base
on
the
north
and
east
and
established
itself
upon
the
line
of
the
oka
and
the
southern
provinces
these
lateral
bases
perpendicular
to
the
front
of
defense
are
often
decisive
in
preventing
the
enemy
from
penetrating
to
the
heart
of
the
country
or
at
least
in
rendering
it
impossible
for
him
to
maintain
himself
there
a
base
upon
a
broad
and
rapid
river
both
banks
being
held
by
strong
works
would
be
as
favorable
as
could
be
desired
the
more
extended
the
base
the
more
difficulty
will
there
be
in
covering
it
but
it
will
also
be
more
difficult
to
cut
the
army
off
from
it
a
state
whose
capital
is
too
near
the
frontier
can
not
have
so
favorable
a
base
in
a
defensive
war
as
one
whose
capital
is
more
retired
a
base
to
be
perfect
should
have
two
or
three
fortified
points
of
sufficient
capacity
for
the
establishment
of
depots
of
supply
there
should
be
a
de
upon
each
of
its
unfordable
streams
all
are
now
agreed
upon
these
principles
but
upon
other
points
opinions
have
varied
some
have
asserted
that
a
perfect
base
is
one
parallel
to
that
of
the
enemy
my
opinion
is
that
bases
perpendicular
to
those
of
the
enemy
are
more
advantageous
particularly
such
as
have
two
sides
almost
perpendicular
to
each
other
and
forming
a
angle
thus
affording
a
double
base
if
required
and
which
by
giving
the
control
of
two
sides
of
the
strategic
field
assure
two
lines
of
retreat
widely
apart
and
facilitate
any
change
of
the
line
of
operations
which
an
unforeseen
turn
of
affairs
may
necessitate
the
quotations
which
follow
are
from
my
treatise
on
great
military
operations
the
general
configuration
of
the
theater
of
war
may
also
have
a
great
influence
upon
the
direction
of
the
lines
of
operations
and
consequently
upon
the
direction
of
the
bases
illustration

if
every
theater
of
war
forms
a
figure
presenting
four
faces
more
or

regular

of
the
armies
at
the
opening
of
the
campaign
may
hold

the

the
different

theater
will
lead
to
widely
different
combinations
to
illustrate
we
will
cite
the
theater
of
the
french
armies
in
westphalia
from
to
and
that
of
napoleon
in
both
of
which
are
represented

troops
the
french

the

hence
it
was
only
necessary
for
them
by
maneuvers
to
gain
the
side
b
d
to
be
masters
of
the
four
faces
including
the
base
and
the
communications
of
the
enemy
the
french
army
starting
from
its
base
c
d
and
gaining
the
front
of
operations
f
g
h
could
cut
off
the
allied
army

from
its

the
latter

be
thrown
upon
the
angle
a

by
the
lines
of
the
rhine
the

and
the
sea
while
the
army
e
could
communicate
with
its
bases
on
the
main
and
rhine
the
movement
of
napoleon
in
on
the
saale
was
similar
he
occupied
at
jena
and
naumburg
the
line
f
g
h
then
marched
by
halle
and
dessau
to
force
the
prussian
army
i
upon
the
sea
represented
by
the
side
a
b
the
result
is
well
known
the
art
then
of
selecting
lines
of
operations
is
to
give
them
such
directions
as
to
seize
the
communications
of
the
enemy
without
losing
one
own
the
line
f
g

by
its
extended
position
and
the
bend
on
the
flank
of
the
enemy
always
protects
the
communications
with
the
base
c
d
and
this
is
exactly
the
maneuvers
of
marengo
ulm
and
jena
when
the
theater
of
war
does
not
border
upon
the
sea
it
is
always
bounded
by
a
powerful
neutral
state
which
guards
its
frontiers
and
closes
one
side
of
the
square
this
may
not
be
an
obstacle
insurmountable
like
the
sea
but
generally
it
may
be
considered
as
an
obstacle
upon
which
it
would
be
dangerous
to
retreat
after
a
defeat
hence
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
force
the
enemy
upon
it
the
soil
of
a
power
which
can
bring
into
the
field
one
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
thousand
troops
can
not
be
violated
with
impunity
and
if
a
defeated
army
made
the
attempt
it
would
be
none
the
less
cut
off
from
its
base
if
the
boundary
of
the
theater
of
war
should
be
the
territory
of
a
weak
state
it
would
be
absorbed
in
this
theater
and
the
square
would
be
enlarged
till
it
reached
the
frontiers
of
a
powerful
state
or
the
sea
the
outline
of
the
frontiers
may
modify
the
shape
of
the
quadrilateral
so
as
to
make
it
approach
the
figure
of
a
parallelogram
or
trapezoid
as
in
figure
in
either
case
the
advantage
of
the
army
which
has
control
of
two
faces
of
the
figure
and
possesses
the
power
of
establishing
upon
them
a
double
base
will
be
still
more
decided
since
it
will
be
able
more
easily
to
cut
the
enemy
off
from
the
shortened
side
as
was
the
case
with
the
prussian
army
in
with
the
side
b
d
j
of
the
parallelogram
formed
by
the
lines
of
the
rhine
the
oder
the
north
sea
and
the
mountainous
frontier
of
franconia
illustration
fig
the
selection
of
bohemia
as
a
base
in
goes
to
prove
the
truth
of
my
opinion
for
it
was
the
perpendicularity
of
this
base
to
that
of
the
french
army
which
enabled
the
allies
to
neutralize
the
immense
advantages
which
the
line
of
the
elbe
would
otherwise
have
afforded
napoleon
and
turned
the
advantages
of
the
campaign
in
their
favor
likewise
in
by
establishing
their
base
perpendicularly
upon
the
oka
and
kalouga
the
russians
were
able
to
execute
their
flank
march
upon
wiazma
and
krasnoi
if
any
thing
further
be
required
to
establish
these
truths
it
will
only
be
necessary
to
consider
that
if
the
base
be
perpendicular
to
that
of
the
enemy
the
front
of
operations
will
be
parallel
to
his
line
of
operations
and
that
hence
it
will
be
easy
to
attack
his
communications
and
line
of
retreat
it
has
been
stated
that
perpendicular
bases
are
particularly
favorable
in
the
case
of
a
double
frontier
as
in
the
last
figures
critics
may
object
to
this
that
it
does
not
agree
with
what
is
elsewhere
said
in
favor
of
frontiers
which
are
salient
toward
the
enemy
and
against
double
lines
of
operations
with
equality
of
force
art
xxi
the
objection
is
not
well
founded
for
the
greatest
advantage
of
a
perpendicular
base
consists
in
the
fact
that
it
forms
such
a
salient
which
takes
in
reverse
a
portion
of
the
theater
of
operations
on
the
other
hand
a
base
with
two
faces
by
no
means
requires
that
both
should
be
occupied
in
force
on
the
contrary
upon
one
of
them
it
will
be
sufficient
to
have
some
fortified
points
garrisoned
by
small
bodies
while
the
great
bulk
of
the
force
rests
upon
the
other
face
as
was
done
in
the
campaigns
of
and
the
angle
of
nearly
ninety
degrees
formed
by
the
portion
of
the
rhine
from
constance
to
basel
and
thence
to
kehl
gave
general
moreau
one
base
parallel
and
another
perpendicular
to
that
of
his
antagonist
he
threw
two
divisions
by
his
left
toward
kehl
on
the
first
base
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
enemy
to
that
point
while
he
moved
with
nine
divisions
upon
the
extremity
of
the
perpendicular
face
toward
schaffhausen
which
carried
him
in
a
few
days
to
the
gates
of
augsburg
the
two
detached
divisions
having
already
rejoined
him
in
napoleon
had
also
the
double
base
of
the
rhine
and
main
forming
almost
a
right
angle
he
left
mortier
upon
the
first
and
parallel
one
while
with
the
mass
of
his
forces
he
gained
the
extremity
of
the
perpendicular
base
and
thus
intercepted
the
prussians
at
gera
and
naumburg
by
reaching
their
line
of
retreat
if
so
many
imposing
facts
prove
that
bases
with
two
faces
one
of
them
being
almost
perpendicular
to
that
of
the
enemy
are
the
best
it
is
well
to
recollect
that
in
default
of
such
a
base
its
advantages
may
be
partially
supplied
by
a
change
of
strategic
front
as
will
be
seen
in
article
xx
another
very
important
point
in
reference
to
the
proper
direction
of
bases
relates
to
those
established
on
the
these
bases
may
be
favorable
in
some
circumstances
but
are
equally
unfavorable
in
others
as
may
be
readily
seen
from
what
precedes
the
danger
which
must
always
exist
of
an
army
being
driven
to
the
sea
seems
so
clear
in
the
ease
of
the
establishment
of
the
base
upon
it
which
bases
can
only
be
favorable
to
naval
powers
that
it
is
astonishing
to
hear
in
our
day
praises
of
such
a
base
wellington
coming
with
a
fleet
to
the
relief
of
spain
and
portugal
could
not
have
secured
a
better
base
than
that
of
lisbon
or
rather
of
the
peninsula
of
which
covers
all
the
avenues
to
that
capital
on
the
land
side
the
sea
and
the
tagus
not
only
protected
both
flanks
but
secured
the
safety
of
his
only
possible
line
of
retreat
which
was
upon
the
fleet
blinded
by
the
advantages
which
the
intrenched
camp
of
secured
for
the
english
and
not
tracing
effects
to
their
real
causes
many
generals
in
other
respects
wise
contend
that
no
bases
are
good
except
such
as
rest
on
the
sea
and
thus
afford
the
army
facilities
of
supply
and
refuge
with
both
flanks
secured
fascinated
by
similar
notions
colonel
asserted
that
in
napoleon
ought
to
have
posted
half
of
his
army
in
bohemia
and
thrown
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
on
the
mouths
of
the
elbe
toward
hamburg
forgetting
that
the
first
precept
for
a
continental
army
is
to
establish
its
base
upon
the
front
farthest
the
sea
so
as
to
secure
the
benefit
of
all
its
elements
of
strength
from
which
it
might
find
itself
cut
off
if
the
base
were
established
upon
the
coast
an
insular
and
naval
power
acting
on
the
continent
would
pursue
a
diametrically
opposite
course
but
resulting
from
the
same
principle
viz
establish
the
base
upon
those
points
where
it
can
be
sustained
by
all
the
resources
of
the
country
and
at
the
same
time
insure
a
safe
a
state
powerful
both
on
land
and
sea
whose
squadrons
control
the
sea
adjacent
to
the
theater
of
operations
might
well
base
an
army
of
forty
or
fifty
thousand
men
upon
the
coast
as
its
retreat
by
sea
and
its
supplies
could
be
well
assured
but
to
establish
a
continental
army
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
upon
such
a
base
when
opposed
by
a
disciplined
and
nearly
equal
force
would
be
an
act
of
madness
however
as
every
maxim
has
its
exceptions
there
is
a
case
in
which
it
may
be
admissible
to
base
a
continental
army
upon
the
sea
it
is
when
your
adversary
is
not
formidable
upon
land
and
when
you
being
master
of
the
sea
can
supply
the
army
with
more
facility
than
in
the
interior
we
rarely
see
these
conditions
fulfilled
it
was
so
however
during
the
turkish
war
of
and
the
whole
attention
of
the
russians
was
given
to
varna
and
bourghas
while
shumla
was
merely
observed
a
plan
which
they
could
not
have
pursued
in
the
presence
of
a
european
army
even
with
the
control
of
the
sea
without
great
danger
of
ruin
despite
all
that
has
been
said
by
triflers
who
pretend
to
decide
upon
the
fate
of
empires
this
war
was
in
the
main
well
conducted
the
army
covered
itself
by
obtaining
the
fortresses
of
brailoff
varna
and
silistria
and
afterward
by
preparing
a
depot
at
sizeboli
as
soon
as
its
base
was
well
established
it
moved
upon
adrianople
which
previously
would
have
been
madness
had
the
season
been
a
couple
of
months
longer
or
had
the
army
not
come
so
great
a
distance
in
the
war
would
have
terminated
with
the
first
campaign
besides
permanent
bases
which
are
usually
established
upon
our
own
frontiers
or
in
the
territory
of
a
faithful
ally
there
are
eventual
or
temporary
bases
which
result
from
the
operations
in
the
country
but
as
these
are
rather
temporary
points
of
support
they
will
to
avoid
confusion
be
discussed
in

strategic
lines
and
points
decisive
points
of
the
theater
of
war
and
objective
points
of
operations
strategic
lines
and
points
are
of
different
kinds
some
receive
this
title
simply
from
their
position
which
gives
them
all
their
importance
these
are
permanent
geographical
strategic
points
others
have
a
value
from
the
relations
they
bear
to
the
positions
of
the
masses
of
the
hostile
troops
and
to
the
enterprises
likely
to
be
directed
against
them
such
are
strategic
points
of
maneuver
and
are
eventual
finally
there
are
points
which
have
only
a
secondary
importance
and
others
whose
importance
is
constant
and
immense
the
latter
are
called
decisive
strategic
points
every
point
of
the
theater
of
war
which
is
of
military
importance
whether
from
its
position
as
a
center
of
communication
or
from
the
presence
of
military
establishments
or
fortifications
is
a
geographical
strategic
point
a
distinguished
general
affirms
that
such
a
point
would
not
necessarily
be
a
strategic
point
unless
situated
favorably
for
a
contemplated
operation
i
think
differently
for
a
strategic
point
is
such
essentially
and
by
nature
and
no
matter
how
far
distant
it
may
be
from
the
scene
of
the
first
enterprises
it
may
be
included
in
the
field
by
some
unforeseen
turn
of
events
and
thus
acquire
its
full
importance
it
would
then
be
more
accurate
to
state
that
all
strategic
points
are
not
necessarily
decisive
points
lines
are
strategic
either
from
their
geographical
position
or
from
their
relation
to
temporary
maneuvers
the
first
class
may
be
subdivided
as
follows
viz
geographic
lines
which
by
their
permanent
importance
belong
to
the
decisive
points
of
the
theater
of
war
and
those
which
have
value
merely
because
they
connect
two
strategic
points
to
prevent
confusion
we
will
elsewhere
treat
of
strategic
lines
in
their
relations
to
maneuvers
confining
ourselves
here
to
what
relates
to
the
and
objective
of
the
zone
of
operations
upon
which
enterprises
occur
although
these
are
most
intimately
connected
since
every
objective
point
ought
necessarily
to
be
one
of
the
decisive
points
of
the
theater
of
war
there
is
nevertheless
a
distinction
between
them
for
all
decisive
points
can
not
be
at
the
same
time
the
objective
of
operations
we
will
then
define
the
first
in
order
to
be
more
easily
guided
in
our
selection
of
the
second
i
think
the
name
of
strategic
should
be
given
to
all
those
which
are
capable
of
exercising
a
marked
influence
either
upon
the
result
of
the
campaign
or
upon
a
single
enterprise
all
points
whose
geographical
position
and
whose
natural
or
artificial
advantages
favor
the
attack
or
defense
of
a
front
of
operations
or
of
a
line
of
defense
are
included
in
this
number
and
large
fortresses
occupy
in
importance
the
first
rank
among
them
the
decisive
points
of
a
theater
of
war
are
of
several
kinds
the
first
are
the
geographic
points
and
lines
whose
importance
is
permanent
and
a
consequence
of
the
configuration
of
the
country
for
example
take
the
case
of
the
french
in
belgium
whoever
is
master
of
the
line
of
the
meuse
will
have
the
greatest
advantages
in
taking
possession
of
the
country
for
his
adversary
being
outflanked
and
inclosed
between
the
meuse
and
the
north
sea
will
be
exposed
to
the
danger
of
total
ruin
if
he
give
battle
parallel
to
that
sea
similarly
the
valley
of
the
danube
presents
a
series
of
important
points
which
have
caused
it
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
key
of
southern
germany
those
points
the
possession
of
which
would
give
the
control
of
the
junction
of
several
valleys
and
of
the
center
of
the
chief
lines
of
communication
in
a
country
are
also
geographic
for
instance
lyons
is
an
important
strategic
point
because
it
controls
the
valleys
of
the
rhone
and
saône
and
is
at
the
center
of
communications
between
france
and
italy
and
between
the
south
and
east
but
it
would
not
be
a
point
unless
well
fortified
or
possessing
an
extended
camp
with
de
leipsic
is
most
certainly
a
strategic
point
inasmuch
as
it
is
at
the
junction
of
all
the
communications
of
northern
germany
were
it
fortified
and
did
it
occupy
both
banks
of
the
river
it
would
be
almost
the
key
of
the
country
if
a
country
has
a
key
or
if
this
expression
means
more
than
a
decisive
point
all
capitals
are
strategic
points
for
the
double
reason
that
they
are
not
only
centers
of
communications
but
also
the
seats
of
power
and
government
in
mountainous
countries
there
are
defiles
which
are
the
only
routes
of
exit
practicable
for
an
army
and
these
may
be
decisive
in
reference
to
any
enterprise
in
this
country
it
is
well
known
how
great
was
the
importance
of
the
defile
of
bard
protected
by
a
single
small
fort
in
the
second
kind
of
decisive
points
are
accidental
points
of
maneuver
which
result
from
the
positions
of
the
troops
on
both
sides
when
mack
was
at
ulm
in
awaiting
the
approach
of
the
russian
army
through
moravia
the
decisive
point
in
an
attack
upon
him
was
donauwerth
or
the
lower
lech
for
if
his
adversaries
gained
it
before
him
he
was
cut
off
from
his
line
of
retreat
and
also
from
the
army
intended
to
support
him
on
the
contrary
kray
who
in
was
in
the
same
position
expected
no
aid
from
bohemia
but
rather
from
the
tyrol
and
from
the
army
of
mélas
in
italy
hence
the
decisive
point
of
attack
upon
him
was
not
donauwerth
but
on
the
opposite
side
by
schaffhausen
since
this
would
take
in
reverse
his
front
of
operations
expose
his
line
of
retreat
cut
him
off
from
his
supporting
army
as
well
as
from
his
base
and
force
him
upon
the
main
in
the
same
campaign
the
first
objective
point
of
napoleon
was
to
fall
upon
the
right
of
mélas
by
the
and
to
seize
his
line
of
communications
hence
ivrea
and
piacenza
were
decisive
points
only
by
reason
of
the
march
of
mélas
upon
nice
it
may
be
laid
down
as
a
general
principle
that
the
decisive
points
of
maneuver
are
on
that
flank
of
the
enemy
upon
which
if
his
opponent
operates
he
can
more
easily
cut
him
off
from
his
base
and
supporting
forces
without
being
exposed
to
the
same
danger
the
flank
opposite
to
the
sea
is
always
to
be
preferred
because
it
gives
an
opportunity
of
forcing
the
enemy
upon
the
sea
the
only
exception
to
this
is
in
the
case
of
an
insular
and
inferior
army
where
the
attempt
although
dangerous
might
be
made
to
cut
it
off
from
the
fleet
if
the
enemy
forces
are
in
detachments
or
are
too
much
extended
the
decisive
point
is
his
center
for
by
piercing
that
his
forces
will
be
more
divided
their
weakness
increased
and
the
fractions
may
be
crushed
separately
the
decisive
point
of
a
will
be
determined
by
the
features
of
the
ground
the
relation
of
the
local
features
to
the
ultimate
strategic
aim
the
positions
occupied
by
the
respective
forces
these
considerations
will
be
discussed
in
the
chapter
on
battles
objective
points
there
are
two
classes
of
objective
points
objective
of
and
objective
a
geographical
objective
point
may
be
an
important
fortress
the
line
of
a
river
a
front
of
operations
which
affords
good
lines
of
defense
or
good
points
of
support
for
ulterior
enterprises
points
of
in
contradistinction
to
derive
their
importance
from
and
their
positions
depend
upon
the
situation
of
the
hostile
masses
in
strategy
the
object
of
the
campaign
determines
the
objective
point
if
this
aim
be
offensive
the
point
will
be
the
possession
of
the
hostile
capital
or
that
of
a
province
whose
loss
would
compel
the
enemy
to
make
peace
in
a
war
of
invasion
the
capital
is
ordinarily
the
objective
point
however
the
geographical
position
of
the
capital
the
political
relations
of
the
belligerents
with
their
neighbors
and
their
respective
resources
are
considerations
foreign
in
themselves
to
the
art
of
fighting
battles
but
intimately
connected
with
plans
of
operations
and
may
decide
whether
an
army
should
attempt
or
not
to
occupy
the
hostile
capital
if
it
be
concluded
not
to
seize
the
capital
the
objective
point
might
be
a
part
of
the
front
of
operations
or
line
of
defense
where
an
important
fort
is
situated
the
possession
of
which
would
render
safe
the
occupation
of
the
neighboring
territory
for
instance
if
france
were
to
invade
italy
in
a
war
against
austria
the
first
objective
point
would
be
the
line
of
the
ticino
and
po
the
second
mantua
and
the
line
of
the
adige
in
the
defensive
the
objective
point
instead
of
being
that
which
it
is
desirable
to
gain
possession
of
is
that
which
is
to
be
defended
the
capital
being
considered
the
seat
of
power
becomes
the
principal
objective
point
of
the
defense
but
there
may
be
other
points
as
the
defense
of
a
first
line
and
of
the
first
base
of
operations
thus
for
a
french
army
reduced
to
the
defensive
behind
the
rhine
the
first
objective
would
be
to
prevent
the
passage
of
the
river
it
would
endeavor
to
relieve
the
forts
in
alsace
if
the
enemy
succeeded
in
effecting
a
passage
of
the
river
and
in
besieging
them
the
second
objective
would
be
to
cover
the
first
base
of
operations
upon
the
meuse
or
moselle
which
might
be
attained
by
a
lateral
defense
as
well
as
one
in
front
as
to
the
objective
points
of
that
is
those
which
relate
particularly
to
the
destruction
or
decomposition
of
the
hostile
forces
their
importance
may
be
seen
by
what
has
already
been
said
the
greatest
talent
of
a
general
and
the
surest
hope
of
success
lie
in
some
degree
in
the
good
choice
of
these
points
this
was
the
most
conspicuous
merit
of
napoleon
rejecting
old
systems
which
were
satisfied
by
the
capture
of
one
or
two
points
or
with
the
occupation
of
an
adjoining
province
he
was
convinced
that
the
best
means
of
accomplishing
great
results
was
to
dislodge
and
destroy
the
hostile
army
since
states
and
provinces
fall
of
themselves
when
there
is
no
organized
force
to
protect
them
to
detect
at
a
glance
the
relative
advantages
presented
by
the
different
zones
of
operations
to
concentrate
the
mass
of
the
forces
upon
that
one
which
gave
the
best
promise
of
success
to
be
indefatigable
in
ascertaining
the
approximate
position
of
the
enemy
to
fall
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
upon
his
center
if
his
front
was
too
much
extended
or
upon
that
flank
by
which
he
could
more
readily
seize
his
communications
to
outflank
him
to
cut
his
line
to
pursue
him
to
the
last
to
disperse
and
destroy
his
forces
such
was
the
system
followed
by
napoleon
in
his
first
campaigns
these
campaigns
proved
this
system
to
be
one
of
the
very
best
when
these
maneuvers
were
applied
in
later
years
to
the
long
distances
and
the
inhospitable
regions
of
russia
they
were
not
so
successful
as
in
germany
however
it
must
be
remembered
that
if
this
kind
of
war
is
not
suitable
to
all
capacities
regions
or
circumstances
its
chances
of
success
are
still
very
great
and
it
is
based
upon
principle
napoleon
abused
the
system
but
this
does
not
disprove
its
real
advantages
when
a
proper
limit
is
assigned
to
its
enterprises
and
they
are
made
in
harmony
with
the
respective
conditions
of
the
armies
and
of
the
adjoining
states
the
maxims
to
be
given
on
these
important
strategic
operations
are
almost
entirely
included
in
what
has
been
said
upon
decisive
points
and
in
what
will
be
stated
in
article
xxi
in
discussing
the
choice
of
lines
of
operations
as
to
the
choice
of
objective
points
every
thing
will
generally
depend
upon
the
aim
of
the
war
and
the
character
which
political
or
other
circumstances
may
give
it
and
finally
upon
the
military
facilities
of
the
two
parties
in
cases
where
there
are
powerful
reasons
for
avoiding
all
risk
it
may
be
prudent
to
aim
only
at
the
acquisition
of
partial
advantages
such
as
the
capture
of
a
few
towns
or
the
possession
of
adjacent
territory
in
other
cases
where
a
party
has
the
means
of
achieving
a
great
success
by
incurring
great
dangers
he
may
attempt
the
destruction
of
the
hostile
army
as
did
napoleon
the
maneuvers
of
ulm
and
jena
can
not
be
recommended
to
an
army
whose
only
object
is
the
siege
of
antwerp
for
very
different
reasons
they
could
not
be
recommended
to
the
french
army
beyond
the
niemen
five
hundred
leagues
from
its
frontiers
because
there
would
be
much
more
to
be
lost
by
failure
than
a
general
could
reasonably
hope
to
gain
by
success
there
is
another
class
of
decisive
points
to
be
mentioned
which
are
determined
more
from
political
than
from
strategic
considerations
they
play
a
great
part
in
most
coalitions
and
influence
the
operations
and
plans
of
cabinets
they
may
be
called
objective
indeed
besides
the
intimate
connection
between
statesmanship
and
war
in
its
preliminaries
in
most
campaigns
some
military
enterprises
are
undertaken
to
carry
out
a
political
end
sometimes
quite
important
but
often
very
irrational
they
frequently
lead
to
the
commission
of
great
errors
in
strategy
we
cite
two
examples
first
the
expedition
of
the
duke
of
york
to
dunkirk
suggested
by
old
commercial
views
gave
to
the
operations
of
the
allies
a
divergent
direction
which
caused
their
failure
hence
this
objective
point
was
bad
in
a
military
view
the
expedition
of
the
same
prince
to
holland
in
likewise
due
to
the
views
of
the
english
cabinet
sustained
by
the
intentions
of
austria
on
belgium
was
not
less
fatal
for
it
led
to
the
march
of
the
archduke
charles
from
zurich
upon
manheim
a
step
quite
contrary
to
the
interests
of
the
allied
armies
at
the
time
it
was
undertaken
these
illustrations
prove
that
political
objective
points
should
be
subordinate
to
strategy
at
least
until
after
a
great
success
has
been
attained
this
subject
is
so
extensive
and
so
complicated
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
attempt
to
reduce
it
to
a
few
rules
the
only
one
which
can
be
given
has
just
been
alluded
to
and
is
that
either
the
political
objective
points
should
be
selected
according
to
the
principles
of
strategy
or
their
consideration
should
be
postponed
till
after
the
decisive
events
of
the
campaign
applying
this
rule
to
the
examples
just
given
it
will
be
seen
that
it
was
at
cambray
or
in
the
heart
of
france
that
dunkirk
should
have
been
conquered
in
and
holland
delivered
in
in
other
words
by
uniting
all
the
strength
of
the
allies
for
great
attempts
on
the
decisive
points
of
the
frontiers
expeditions
of
this
kind
are
generally
included
in
grand
diversions
to
be
treated
of
in
a
separate
article

footnote
i
may
be
reproached
with
inaccuracy
of
expression
since
a
line
can
not
be
a
and
yet
i
apply
to
lines
the
name
of
decisive
or
objective
points
it
seems
almost
useless
to
remark
that
points
are
not
geometric
points
but
that
the

is
a
form
of

used
to
designate
the
object
which
an
army
desires
to
attain

fronts
of
operations
strategic
fronts
lines
of
defense
and
strategic
positions
there
are
some
parts
of
the
military
science
that
so
closely
resemble
each
other
and
are
so
intimately
allied
that
they
are
frequently
confounded
although
they
are
decidedly
distinct
such
are
of
operations
strategic
fronts
lines
of
and
it
is
proposed
in
this
article
to
show
the
distinction
between
them
and
to
expose
their
relations
to
each
other
fronts
of
operations
and
strategic
fronts
when
the
masses
of
an
army
are
posted
in
a
zone
of
operations
they
generally
occupy
strategic
positions
the
extent
of
the
front
occupied
toward
the
enemy
is
called
the
the
portion
of
the
theater
of
war
from
which
an
enemy
can
probably
reach
this
front
in
two
or
three
marches
is
called
the
of
the
resemblance
between
these
two
fronts
has
caused
many
military
men
to
confound
them
sometimes
under
one
name
and
sometimes
under
the
other
rigorously
speaking
however
the
strategic
front
designates
that
formed
by
the
actual
positions
occupied
by
the
masses
of
the
army
while
the
other
embraces
the
space
separating
the
two
armies
and
extends
one
or
two
marches
beyond
each
extremity
of
the
strategic
front
and
includes
the
ground
upon
which
the
armies
will
probably
come
in
collision
when
the
operations
of
a
campaign
are
on
the
eve
of
commencing
one
of
the
armies
will
decide
to
await
the
attack
of
the
other
and
will
undertake
to
prepare
a
line
of
defense
which
may
be
either
that
of
the
strategic
front
or
more
to
the
rear
hence
the
strategic
front
and
line
of
defense
may
coincide
as
was
the
case
in
and
upon
the
rhine
which
was
then
a
line
of
defense
for
both
austrians
and
french
and
at
the
same
time
their
strategic
front
and
front
of
operations
this
occasional
coincidence
of
these
lines
doubtless
leads
persons
to
confound
them
while
they
are
really
very
different
an
army
has
not
necessarily
a
line
of
defense
as
for
example
when
it
invades
when
its
masses
are
concentrated
in
a
single
position
it
has
no
strategic
front
but
it
is
never
without
a
front
of
operations
the
two
following
examples
will
illustrate
the
difference
between
the
different
terms
at
the
resumption
of
hostilities
in
napoleon
front
of
operations
extended
at
first
from
hamburg
to
wittenberg
thence
it
ran
along
the
line
of
the
allies
toward
glogau
and
breslau
his
right
being
at
löwenberg
and
followed
along
the
frontier
of
bohemia
to
dresden
his
forces
were
stationed
on
this
grand
front
in
four
masses
whose
strategic
positions
were
interior
and
central
and
presented
three
different
faces
subsequently
he
retired
behind
the
elbe
his
real
line
of
defense
then
extended
only
from
wittenberg
to
dresden
with
a
bend
to
the
rear
toward
marienberg
for
hamburg
and
magdeburg
were
beyond
the
strategic
field
and
it
would
have
been
fatal
for
him
to
have
extended
his
operations
to
these
points
the
other
example
is
his
position
about
mantua
in
his
front
of
operations
here
really
extended
from
the
mountains
of
bergamo
to
the
adriatic
sea
while
his
real
line
of
defense
was
upon
the
adige
between
lake
garda
and
legnago
afterward
it
was
upon
the
mincio
between
peschiera
and
mantua
while
his
strategic
front
varied
according
to
his
positions
the
front
of
operations
being
the
space
which
separates
the
two
armies
and
upon
which
they
may
fight
is
ordinarily
parallel
to
the
base
of
operations
the
strategic
front
will
have
the
same
direction
and
ought
to
be
perpendicular
to
the
principal
line
of
operations
and
to
extend
far
enough
on
either
flank
to
cover
this
line
well
however
this
direction
may
vary
either
on
account
of
projects
that
are
formed
or
on
account
of
the
attacks
of
the
enemy
and
it
quite
frequently
happens
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
front
perpendicular
to
the
base
and
parallel
to
the
original
line
of
operations
such
a
change
of
strategic
front
is
one
of
the
most
important
of
all
grand
maneuvers
for
by
this
means
the
control
of
two
faces
of
the
strategic
field
may
be
obtained
thus
giving
the
army
a
position
almost
as
favorable
as
if
it
possessed
a
base
with
two
faces
see
art
xviii
the
strategic
front
of
napoleon
in
his
march
on
eylau
illustrates
these
points
his
pivots
of
operations
were
at
warsaw
and
thorn
which
made
the
vistula
a
temporary
base
the
front
became
parallel
to
the
narew
from
whence
he
set
out
supported
by
sierock
pultusk
and
ostrolenka
to
maneuver
by
his
right
and
throw
the
russians
on
elbing
and
the
baltic
in
such
cases
if
a
point
of
support
in
the
new
direction
can
be
obtained
the
strategic
front
gives
the
advantages
referred
to
above
it
ought
to
be
borne
in
mind
in
such
maneuvers
that
the
army
should
always
be
sure
of
regaining
its
temporary
base
if
necessary
in
other
words
that
this
base
should
be
prolonged
behind
the
strategic
front
and
should
be
covered
by
it
napoleon
marching
from
the
narew
by
allenstein
upon
eylau
had
behind
his
left
thorn
and
farther
from
the
front
of
the
army
the
de
of
praga
and
warsaw
so
that
his
communications
were
safe
while
benningsen
forced
to
face
him
and
to
make
his
line
parallel
to
the
baltic
might
be
cut
off
from
his
base
and
be
thrown
back
upon
the
mouths
of
the
vistula
napoleon
executed
another
very
remarkable
change
of
strategic
front
in
his
march
from
gera
upon
jena
and
naumburg
in
moreau
made
another
in
moving
by
his
right
upon
augsburg
and
dillingen
fronting
the
danube
and
france
and
thereby
forcing
kray
to
evacuate
the
intrenched
camp
at
ulm
the
change
of
the
strategic
front
to
a
position
perpendicular
to
the
base
may
be
a
temporary
movement
for
an
operation
of
a
few
duration
or
it
may
be
for
an
indefinite
time
in
order
to
profit
by
important
advantages
afforded
by
certain
localities
to
strike
decisive
blows
or
to
procure
for
the
army
a
good
line
of
defense
and
good
pivots
of
operations
which
would
be
almost
equivalent
to
a
real
base
it
often
happens
that
an
army
is
compelled
to
have
a
double
strategic
front
either
by
the
features
of
the
theater
of
war
or
because
every
line
of
offensive
operations
requires
protection
on
its
flanks
as
an
example
of
the
first
the
frontiers
of
turkey
and
spain
may
be
cited
in
order
to
cross
the
balkan
or
the
ebro
an
army
would
be
obliged
to
present
a
double
front
in
the
first
case
to
face
the
valley
of
the
danube
in
the
second
to
confront
forces
coming
from
saragossa
or
leon
all
extensive
countries
necessitate
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
the
same
precaution
a
french
army
in
the
valley
of
the
danube
will
require
a
double
front
as
soon
as
the
austrians
have
thrown
sufficient
troops
into
the
tyrol
or
bohemia
to
give
rise
to
any
anxiety
those
countries
which
present
a
narrow
frontier
to
the
enemy
are
the
only
exception
since
the
troops
left
on
the
frontier
to
harass
the
flanks
of
the
enemy
could
themselves
be
cut
off
and
captured
this
necessity
of
double
strategic
fronts
is
one
of
the
most
serious
inconveniences
of
an
offensive
war
since
it
requires
large
detachments
which
are
always
dangerous
see
article
xxxvi
of
course
all
that
precedes
relates
to
regular
warfare
in
a
national
or
intestine
war
the
whole
country
is
the
scene
of
hostilities
nevertheless
each
large
fraction
of
an
army
having
a
defined
aim
would
have
its
own
strategic
front
determined
by
the
features
of
the
country
and
the
positions
occupied
by
the
large
bodies
of
the
enemy
thus
suchet
in
catalonia
and
massena
in
portugal
each
had
a
strategic
front
while
the
front
of
some
other
corps
of
the
army
was
not
clearly
defined
lines
of
defense
lines
of
defense
are
classified
as
strategical
and
tactical
strategical
lines
of
defense
are
subdivided
into
two
classes
permanent
lines
of
defense
which
are
a
part
of
the
defensive
system
of
a
state
such
as
the
line
of
a
fortified
frontier
eventual
lines
of
defense
which
relate
only
to
the
temporary
position
of
an
army
the
frontier
is
a
permanent
line
of
defense
when
it
presents
a
system
of
obstacles
natural
and
artificial
such
as
ranges
of
mountains
broad
rivers
and
fortresses
thus
the
range
of
the
alps
between
france
and
piedmont
is
a
line
of
defense
since
the
practicable
passes
are
guarded
by
forts
which
would
prove
great
obstacles
in
the
way
of
an
army
and
since
the
outlets
of
the
gorges
in
the
valleys
of
piedmont
are
protected
by
large
fortresses
the
rhine
the
oder
and
the
elbe
may
also
be
considered
as
permanent
lines
of
defense
on
account
of
the
important
forts
found
upon
them
every
river
of
any
considerable
width
every
range
of
mountains
and
every
defile
having
their
weak
points
covered
by
temporary
fortifications
may
be
regarded
as
lines
of
both
strategic
and
tactical
since
they
may
arrest
for
some
time
the
progress
of
the
enemy
or
may
compel
him
to
deviate
to
the
right
or
left
in
search
of
a
weaker
point
in
which
case
the
advantage
is
evidently
strategic
if
the
enemy
attack
in
front
the
lines
present
an
evident
tactical
advantage
since
it
is
always
more
difficult
to
drive
an
army
from
its
position
behind
a
river
or
from
a
point
naturally
and
artificially
strong
than
to
attack
it
on
an
open
plain
on
the
other
hand
this
advantage
must
not
be
considered
unqualified
lest
we
should
fall
into
the
system
of
positions
which
has
been
the
ruin
of
so
many
armies
for
whatever
may
be
the
facilities
of
a
position
for
defense
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
party
which
remains
in
it
passive
and
receiving
all
the
attacks
of
his
adversary
will
finally
yield
in
addition
to
this
since
a
position
naturally
very
strong
is
difficult
of
access
it
will
be
as
difficult
of
egress
the
enemy
may
be
able
with
an
inferior
force
to
confine
the
army
by
guarding
all
the
outlets
this
happened
to
the
saxons
in
the
camp
of
pirna
and
to
wurmser
in
mantua
strategic
positions
there
is
a
disposition
of
armies
to
which
the
name
of
strategic
position
may
be
applied
to
distinguish
from
tactical
positions
or
positions
for
battle
strategic
positions
are
those
taken
for
some
time
and
which
are
intended
to
cover
a
much
greater
portion
of
the
front
of
operations
than
would
be
covered
in
an
actual
battle
all
positions
behind
a
river
or
upon
a
line
of
defense
the
divisions
of
the
army
being
separated
by
considerable
distances
are
of
this
class
such
as
those
of
napoleon
at
rivoli
verona
and
legnago
to
overlook
the
adige
his
positions
in
in
saxony
and
silesia
in
advance
of
his
line
of
defense
were
strategic
the
positions
of
the
armies
on
the
frontier
of
belgium
before
the
battle
of
ligny
and
that
of
massena
on
the
limmat
and
aar
in
were
also
strategic
even
winter
quarters
when
compact
and
in
face
of
the
enemy
and
not
protected
by
an
armistice
are
strategic
positions
for
instance
napoleon
on
the
passarge
in
the
daily
positions
taken
up
by
an
army
beyond
the
reach
of
the
enemy
which
are
sometimes
spread
out
either
to
deceive
him
or
to
facilitate
movements
are
of
this
class
this
class
also
includes
positions
occupied
by
an
army
to
cover
several
points
and
positions
held
by
the
masses
of
an
army
for
the
purposes
of
observation
the
different
positions
taken
up
on
a
line
of
defense
the
positions
of
detachments
on
a
double
front
of
operations
the
position
of
a
detachment
covering
a
siege
the
main
army
in
the
meanwhile
operating
on
another
point
are
all
strategic
indeed
all
large
detachments
or
fractions
of
an
army
may
be
considered
as
occupying
strategic
positions
the
maxims
to
be
given
on
the
preceding
points
are
few
since
fronts
lines
of
defense
and
strategic
positions
generally
depend
upon
a
multitude
of
circumstances
giving
rise
to
infinite
variety
in
every
case
the
first
general
rule
is
that
the
communications
with
the
different
points
of
the
line
of
operations
be
thoroughly
assured
in
the
defense
it
is
desirable
that
the
strategic
fronts
and
lines
of
defense
should
present
both
upon
the
flanks
and
front
formidable
natural
or
artificial
obstacles
to
serve
as
points
of
support
the
points
of
support
on
the
strategic
front
are
called
of
and
are
practical
temporary
bases
but
quite
different
from
pivots
of
maneuver
for
example
in
verona
was
an
excellent
pivot
of
operations
for
all
napoleon
enterprises
about
mantua
for
eight
months
in
dresden
was
his
pivot
pivots
of
maneuver
are
detachments
of
troops
left
to
guard
points
which
it
is
essential
to
hold
while
the
bulk
of
the
army
proceeds
to
the
fulfillment
of
some
important
end
and
when
this
is
accomplished
the
pivot
of
maneuver
ceases
to
exist
thus
ney
corps
was
the
pivot
of
napoleon
maneuver
by
donauwerth
and
augsburg
to
cut
mack
from
his
line
of
retreat
a
pivot
of
operations
on
the
contrary
is
a
material
point
of
both
strategical
and
tactical
importance
serves
as
a
point
of
support
and
endures
throughout
a
campaign
the
most
desirable
quality
of
a
line
of
defense
is
that
it
should
be
as
short
as
possible
in
order
to
be
covered
with
facility
by
the
army
if
it
is
compelled
to
take
the
defensive
it
is
also
important
that
the
extent
of
the
strategic
front
should
not
be
so
great
as
to
prevent
the
prompt
concentration
of
the
fractions
of
the
army
upon
an
advantageous
point
the
same
does
not
altogether
apply
to
the
front
of
operations
for
if
it
be
too
contracted
it
would
be
difficult
for
an
army
on
the
offensive
to
make
strategic
maneuvers
calculated
to
produce
great
results
since
a
short
front
could
be
easily
covered
by
the
defensive
army
neither
should
the
front
of
operations
be
too
extended
such
a
front
is
unsuitable
for
offensive
operations
as
it
would
give
the
enemy
if
not
a
good
line
of
defense
at
least
ample
space
to
escape
from
the
results
of
a
strategic
maneuver
even
if
well
planned
thus
the
beautiful
operations
of
marengo
ulm
and
jena
could
not
have
produced
the
same
results
upon
a
theater
of
the
magnitude
of
that
of
the
russian
war
in
since
the
enemy
even
if
cut
off
from
his
line
of
retreat
could
have
found
another
by
adopting
a
new
zone
of
operations
the
essential
conditions
for
every
strategic
position
are
that
it
should
be
more
compact
than
the
forces
opposed
that
all
fractions
of
the
army
should
have
sure
and
easy
means
of
concentrating
free
from
the
intervention
of
the
enemy
thus
for
forces
nearly
equal
all
central
or
interior
positions
would
be
preferable
to
exterior
ones
since
the
front
in
the
latter
case
would
necessarily
be
more
extended
and
would
lead
to
a
dangerous
division
of
force
great
mobility
and
activity
on
the
part
of
the
troops
occupying
these
positions
will
be
a
strong
element
of
security
or
of
superiority
over
the
enemy
since
it
renders
possible
rapid
concentration
at
different
and
successive
points
of
the
front
an
army
should
never
long
occupy
any
strategic
point
without
making
selection
of
one
or
two
tactical
positions
for
the
purpose
of
there
concentrating
all
the
disposable
force
and
giving
battle
to
the
enemy
when
he
shall
have
unveiled
his
designs
in
this
manner
napoleon
prepared
the
fields
of
rivoli
and
austerlitz
wellington
that
of
waterloo
and
the
archduke
charles
that
of
wagram
when
an
army
either
camps
or
goes
into
quarters
the
general
should
be
careful
that
the
front
be
not
too
extended
a
disposition
which
might
be
called
the
strategic
square
seems
best
presenting
three
faces
so
that
the
distance
to
be
passed
over
would
be
about
equal
for
all
the
divisions
in
concentrating
upon
the
common
center
to
receive
an
attack
every
strategic
line
of
defense
should
always
possess
a
tactical
point
upon
which
to
rally
for
defense
should
the
enemy
cross
the
strategic
front
for
instance
an
army
guarding
a
bank
of
a
river
not
being
able
to
occupy
in
force
the
whole
line
ought
always
to
have
a
position
in
rear
of
the
center
selected
upon
which
to
collect
all
his
divisions
so
as
to
oppose
them
united
to
the
enemy
when
he
has
succeeded
in
effecting
a
passage
for
an
army
entering
a
country
with
the
purpose
either
of
subjugation
or
of
temporary
occupation
it
would
always
be
prudent
however
brilliant
may
have
been
its
earlier
successes
to
prepare
a
line
of
defense
as
a
refuge
in
case
of
reverse
this
remark
is
made
to
complete
the
subject
the
lines
themselves
are
intimately
connected
with
temporary
bases
and
will
be
discussed
in

zones
and
lines
of
operations
a
zone
of
operations
is
a
certain
fraction
of
the
whole
theater
of
war
which
may
be
traversed
by
an
army
in
the
attainment
of
its
object
whether
it
act
singly
or
in
concert
with
other
and
secondary
armies
for
example
in
the
plan
of
campaign
of
italy
was
the
zone
of
the
right
bavaria
that
of
the
center
franconia
that
of
the
left
army
a
zone
of
operations
may
sometimes
present
but
a
single
of
either
on
account
of
the
configuration
of
the
country
or
of
the
small
number
of
practicable
routes
for
an
army
found
therein
generally
however
a
zone
presents
several
of
depending
partly
upon
the
plans
of
the
campaign
partly
upon
the
number
of
great
routes
of
communication
existing
in
the
theater
of
operations
it
is
not
to
be
understood
from
this
that
every
road
is
of
itself
a
of
though
doubtless
it
may
happen
that
any
good
road
in
a
certain
turn
of
affairs
may
become
for
the
such
a
line
but
as
long
as
it
is
only
traversed
by
detachments
and
lies
beyond
the
sphere
of
the
principal
enterprises
it
can
not
truly
be
called
the
real
line
of
operations
moreover
the
existence
of
several
routes
leading
to
the
same
front
of
operations
and
separated
by
one
or
two
marches
would
not
constitute
so
many
lines
of
operations
but
being
the
communications
of
the
different
divisions
of
the
same
army
the
whole
space
bounded
by
them
would
constitute
but
a
single
line
the
term
of
is
applied
to
a
large
fraction
of
the
general
theater
of
war
the
term
of
will
designate
the
part
of
this
fraction
embraced
by
the
enterprises
of
the
army
whether
it
follow
a
single
or
several
routes
the
term
will
apply
to
those
important
lines
which
connect
the
decisive
points
of
the
theater
of
operations
either
with
each
other
or
with
the
front
of
operations
and
for
the
same
reason
we
give
this
name
to
those
lines
which
the
army
would
follow
to
reach
one
of
these
decisive
points
or
to
accomplish
an
important
maneuver
which
requires
a
temporary
deviation
from
the
principal
line
of
operations
of
designate
the
practicable
routes
between
the
different
portions
of
the
army
occupying
different
positions
throughout
the
zone
of
operations
for
example
in
after
the
accession
of
austria
to
the
grand
coalition
three
allied
armies
were
to
invade
saxony
one
bavaria
and
another
italy
so
that
saxony
or
rather
the
country
between
dresden
magdeburg
and
breslau
formed
the
zone
of
operations
of
the
mass
of
the
forces
this
zone
had
three
of
leading
to
leipsic
as
an
objective
the
first
was
the
line
of
the
army
of
bohemia
leading
from
the
mountains
of
erzgebirge
by
dresden
and
chemnitz
upon
leipsic
the
second
was
the
line
of
the
army
of
silesia
going
from
breslau
by
dresden
or
by
wittenberg
upon
leipsic
the
third
was
that
of
bernadotte
from
berlin
by
dessau
to
the
same
objective
point
each
of
these
armies
marched
upon
two
or
more
adjacent
parallel
routes
but
it
could
not
be
said
that
there
were
as
many
lines
of
operations
as
roads
the
principal
line
of
operations
is
that
followed
by
the
bulk
of
the
army
and
upon
which
depots
of
provisions
munitions
and
other
supplies
are
echeloned
and
over
which
if
compelled
it
would
retreat
if
the
choice
of
a
zone
of
operations
involves
no
extensive
combinations
since
there
can
never
be
more
than
two
or
three
zones
on
each
theater
and
the
advantages
generally
result
from
the
localities
it
is
somewhat
different
with
lines
of
operations
as
they
are
divided
into
different
classes
according
to
their
relations
to
the
different
positions
of
the
enemy
to
the
communications
upon
the
strategic
field
and
to
the
enterprises
projected
by
the
commander
lines
of
are
those
of
an
army
acting
from
a
frontier
when
it
is
not
subdivided
into
large
independent
bodies
lines
of
are
those
of
two
independent
armies
proceeding
from
the
same
frontier
or
those
of
two
nearly
equal
armies
which
are
commanded
by
the
same
general
but
are
widely
separated
in
distance
and
for
long
intervals
of
time
lines
of
are
those
adopted
by
one
or
two
armies
to
oppose
several
hostile
bodies
and
having
such
a
direction
that
the
general
can
concentrate
the
masses
and
maneuver
with
his
whole
force
in
a
shorter
period
of
time
than
it
would
require
for
the
enemy
to
oppose
to
them
a
greater
force
lead
to
the
opposite
result
and
are
those
formed
by
an
army
which
operates
at
the
same
time
on
both
flanks
of
the
enemy
or
against
several
of
his
masses
lines
of
are
those
which
depart
from
points
and
meet
at
the
same
point
either
in
advance
of
or
behind
the
base
are
those
by
which
an
army
would
leave
a
given
point
to
move
upon
several
distinct
points
these
lines
of
course
necessitate
a
subdivision
of
the
army
there
are
also
which
are
simply
the
term
i
apply
to
momentary
strategic
lines
often
adopted
for
a
single
temporary
maneuver
and
which
are
by
no
means
to
be
confounded
with
the
real
of
are
those
of
two
armies
acting
so
as
to
afford
each
other
mutual
support
as
in
the
army
of
the
sambre
and
meuse
was
secondary
to
the
army
of
the
rhine
and
in
the
army
of
bagration
was
secondary
to
that
of
barclay
are
those
brought
about
by
events
which
change
the
original
plan
and
give
a
new
direction
to
operations
these
are
of
the
highest
importance
the
proper
occasions
for
their
use
are
fully
recognized
only
by
a
great
and
active
mind
there
may
be
in
addition
and
lines
of
the
first
designate
the
line
adopted
by
an
army
in
a
preliminary
decisive
enterprise
after
which
it
is
at
liberty
to
select
a
more
advantageous
or
direct
line
they
seem
to
belong
as
much
to
the
class
of
temporary
or
eventual
strategic
lines
as
to
the
class
of
lines
of
operations
these
definitions
show
how
i
differ
from
those
authors
who
have
preceded
me
lloyd
and
bulow
attribute
to
these
lines
no
other
importance
than
that
arising
from
their
relations
to
the
depots
of
the
army
the
latter
has
even
asserted
that
when
an
army
is
encamped
near
its
depots
it
has
no
lines
of
operations
the
following
example
will
disprove
this
paradox
let
us
suppose
two
armies
the
first
on
the
upper
rhine
the
second
in
advance
of
dusseldorf
or
any
other
point
of
this
frontier
and
that
their
large
depots
are
immediately
behind
the
river
certainly
the
safest
nearest
and
most
advantageous
position
for
them
which
could
possibly
be
adopted
these
armies
will
have
an
offensive
or
defensive
object
hence
they
will
certainly
have
lines
of
operations
arising
from
the
different
proposed
enterprises
their
defensive
territorial
line
starting
from
their
positions
will
extend
to
the
second
line
which
they
are
to
cover
and
they
would
both
be
cut
off
from
this
second
line
should
the
enemy
establish
himself
in
the
interval
which
separates
them
from
it
even
if
mélas
had
possessed
a
year
supplies
in
alessandria
he
would
none
the
less
have
been
cut
off
from
his
base
of
the
mincio
as
soon
as
the
victorious
enemy
occupied
the
line
of
the
po
their
line
would
be
double
and
the
enemy
single
if
he
concentrated
his
forces
to
defeat
these
armies
successively
it
would
be
a
double
exterior
line
and
the
enemy
a
double
interior
if
the
latter
divided
his
forces
into
two
masses
giving
them
such
directions
as
to
enable
him
to
concentrate
all
his
forces
before
the
two
armies
first
referred
to
could
unite
bulow
would
have
been
more
nearly
right
had
he
asserted
that
an
army
on
its
own
soil
is
less
dependent
on
its
primitive
line
of
operations
than
when
on
foreign
ground
for
it
finds
in
every
direction
points
of
support
and
some
of
the
advantages
which
are
sought
for
in
the
establishment
of
lines
of
operations
it
may
even
lose
its
line
of
operations
without
incurring
great
danger
but
that
is
no
reason
why
it
has
no
line
of
operations
observations
upon
the
lines
of
operations
in
the
wars
of
the
french
revolution
at
the
beginning
of
this
terrible
and
struggle
prussia
and
austria
were
the
only
avowed
enemies
of
france
and
italy
was
included
in
the
theater
of
war
only
for
purposes
of
reciprocal
observation
it
being
too
remote
for
decisive
enterprises
in
view
of
the
end
proposed
the
real
theater
extended
from
huningue
to
dunkirk
and
comprised
three
zones
of
operations
the
first
reaching
along
the
rhine
from
huningue
to
landau
and
thence
to
the
moselle
the
center
consisting
of
the
interval
between
the
meuse
and
moselle
the
third
and
left
was
the
frontier
from
givet
to
dunkirk
when
france
declared
war
in
april
her
intention
was
to
prevent
a
union
of
her
enemies
and
she
had
then
one
hundred
thousand
men
in
the
zones
just
described
while
austria
had
but
thousand
in
belgium
it
is
quite
impossible
to
understand
why
the
french
did
not
conquer
this
country
when
no
effectual
resistance
could
have
been
made
four
months
intervened
between
the
declaration
of
war
and
the
concentration
of
the
allied
troops
was
it
not
probable
that
an
invasion
of
belgium
would
have
prevented
that
of
champagne
and
have
given
the
king
of
prussia
a
conception
of
the
strength
of
france
and
induced
him
not
to
sacrifice
his
armies
for
the
secondary
object
of
imposing
upon
france
another
form
of
government
when
the
prussians
arrived
at
coblentz
toward
the
end
of
july
the
french
were
no
longer
able
to
invade
this
was
reserved
for
the
allies
and
it
is
well
known
how
they
acquitted
themselves
the
whole
force
of
the
french
was
now
about
one
hundred
and
fifteen
thousand
men
it
was
scattered
over
a
frontier
of
one
hundred
and
forty
leagues
and
divided
into
five
corps
and
could
not
make
a
good
defense
for
to
paralyze
them
and
prevent
their
concentration
it
was
only
necessary
to
attack
the
center
political
reasons
were
also
in
favor
of
this
plan
of
attack
the
end
proposed
was
political
and
could
only
be
attained
by
rapid
and
vigorous
measures
the
line
between
the
moselle
and
meuse
which
was
the
center
was
less
fortified
than
the
rest
of
the
frontier
and
besides
gave
the
allies
the
advantage
of
the
excellent
fortress
of
luxembourg
as
a
base
they
wisely
adopted
this
plan
of
attack
but
the
execution
was
not
equal
to
the
conception
the
court
of
vienna
had
the
greatest
interest
in
the
war
for
family
reasons
as
well
as
on
account
of
the
dangers
to
which
a
reverse
might
subject
her
provinces
for
some
reason
difficult
to
understand
austria
only
to
the
extent
of
thirty
battalions
thousand
men
remained
as
an
army
of
observation
in
brisgau
on
the
rhine
and
in
flanders
where
were
the
imposing
armies
she
afterward
displayed
and
what
more
useful
disposition
could
have
been
made
of
them
than
to
protect
the
flanks
of
the
invading
army
this
remarkable
conduct
on
the
part
of
austria
which
cost
her
so
much
may
account
for
the
resolution
of
prussia
to
retire
at
a
later
period
and
quit
the
field
as
she
did
at
the
very
moment
when
she
should
have
entered
it
during
the
campaign
the
prussians
did
not
exhibit
the
activity
necessary
for
success
they
spent
eight
days
uselessly
in
camp
at
kons
if
they
had
anticipated
dumouriez
at
the
little
islands
or
had
even
made
a
more
serious
effort
to
drive
him
from
them
they
would
still
have
had
all
the
advantage
of
a
concentrated
force
against
several
scattered
divisions
and
could
have
prevented
their
junction
and
overthrown
them
separately
frederick
the
great
would
have
justified
the
remark
of
dumouriez
at
grandpré
that
if
his
antagonist
had
been
the
great
king
he
dumouriez
would
already
have
been
driven
behind
châlons
the
austrians
in
this
campaign
proved
that
they
were
still
imbued
with
the
false
system
of
daun
and
lascy
of
covering
every
point
in
order
to
guard
every
point
the
fact
of
having
twenty
thousand
men
in
brisgau
while
the
moselle
and
sarre
were
uncovered
shows
the
fear
they
had
of
losing
a
village
and
how
their
system
led
to
large
detachments
which
are
frequently
the
ruin
of
armies
forgetting
that
the
surest
hope
of
victory
lies
in
presenting
the
strongest
force
they
thought
it
necessary
to
occupy
the
whole
length
of
a
frontier
to
prevent
invasion
which
was
exactly
the
means
of
rendering
invasion
upon
every
point
feasible
i
will
further
observe
that
in
thin
campaign
dumouriez
foolishly
abandoned
the
pursuit
of
the
allies
in
order
to
transfer
the
theater
from
the
center
to
the
extreme
left
of
the
general
field
moreover
he
was
unable
to
perceive
the
great
results
rendered
possible
by
this
movement
but
attacked
the
army
of
the
duke
of
in
front
while
by
descending
the
meuse
to
namur
he
might
have
thrown
it
back
upon
the
north
sea
toward
meuport
or
ostend
and
have
destroyed
it
entirely
in
a
more
successful
battle
than
that
of
jemmapes
the
campaign
of
affords
a
new
instance
of
the
effect
of
a
faulty
direction
of
operations
the
austrians
were
victorious
and
recovered
belgium
because
dumouriez
unskillfully
extended
his
front
of
operations
to
the
gates
of
rotterdam
thus
far
the
conduct
of
the
allies
deserves
praise
the
desire
of
reconquering
these
rich
provinces
justified
this
enterprise
which
moreover
was
judiciously
directed
against
the
extreme
right
of
the
long
front
of
dumouriez
but
after
the
french
had
been
driven
back
under
the
guns
of
valenciennes
and
were
disorganized
and
unable
to
resist
why
did
the
allies
remain
six
months
in
front
of
a
few
towns
and
permit
the
committee
of
public
safety
to
organize
new
armies
when
the
deplorable
condition
of
france
and
the
destitution
of
the
wreck
of
the
army
of
dampierre
are
considered
can
the
parades
of
the
allies
in
front
of
the
fortresses
in
flanders
be
understood
invasions
of
a
country
whose
strength
lies
mainly
in
the
capital
are
particularly
advantageous
under
the
government
of
a
powerful
prince
and
in
ordinary
wars
the
most
important
point
is
the
of
the
army
but
under
a
weak
prince
in
a
republic
and
still
more
in
wars
of
opinion
the
capital
is
generally
the
center
of
national
power
if
this
is
ever
doubtful
it
was
not
so
on
this
occasion
paris
was
france
and
this
to
such
an
extent
that
of
the
nation
had
risen
against
the
government
which
oppressed
them
if
after
having
beaten
the
french
army
at
famars
the
allies
had
left
the
dutch
and
hanoverians
to
observe
what
remained
of
it
while
the
english
and
the
austrians
directed
their
operations
upon
the
meuse
the
sarre
and
the
moselle
in
concert
with
the
prussians
and
a
part
of
the
useless
army
of
the
upper
rhine
a
force
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
with
its
flanks
protected
by
other
troops
could
have
been
pushed
forward
it
is
even
probable
that
without
changing
the
direction
of
the
war
or
running
great
risks
the
dutch
and
hanoverians
could
have
performed
the
duty
of
observing
maubeuge
and
valenciennes
while
the
bulk
of
the
army
pursued
the
remains
of
dampierre
forces
after
gaining
several
victories
however
two
hundred
thousand
men
were
engaged
in
carrying
on
a
few
sieges
and
were
not
gaining
a
foot
of
ground
while
they
threatened
france
with
invasion
they
placed
fifteen
or
sixteen
bodies
of
troops
defensively
to
cover
their
own
frontier
when
valenciennes
and
mayence
capitulated
instead
of
falling
with
all
their
forces
upon
the
camp
at
cambray
they
flew
off
excentrically
to
dunkirk
on
one
side
and
landau
on
the
other
it
is
not
less
astonishing
that
after
making
the
greatest
efforts
in
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
upon
the
right
of
the
general
field
they
should
have
shifted
them
afterward
to
the
extreme
left
so
that
while
the
allies
were
operating
in
flanders
they
were
in
no
manner
seconded
or
aided
by
the
imposing
army
upon
the
rhine
and
when
in
its
turn
this
army
took
up
the
offensive
the
allies
remained
inactive
upon
the
sambre
do
not
these
false
combinations
resemble
those
of
soubise
and
broglie
in
and
all
the
operations
of
the
seven
years
war
in
the
phase
of
affairs
is
wholly
changed
the
french
from
a
painful
defensive
pass
to
a
brilliant
offensive
the
combinations
of
this
campaign
were
doubtless
well
considered
but
it
is
wrong
to
represent
them
as
forming
a
new
system
of
war
to
be
convinced
of
this
it
is
only
necessary
to
observe
that
the
respective
positions
of
the
armies
in
this
campaign
and
in
that
of
were
almost
identical
and
the
direction
of
the
operations
is
quite
the
same
the
french
had
four
corps
which
constituted
two
armies
as
the
king
of
prussia
had
four
divisions
which
composed
two
armies
these
two
large
bodies
took
a
concentric
direction
leading
on
brussels
as
frederick
and
schwerin
had
adopted
in
on
prague
the
only
difference
between
the
two
plans
is
that
the
austrian
troops
in
flanders
were
not
so
much
scattered
as
those
of
brown
in
bohemia
but
this
difference
is
certainly
not
favorable
to
the
plan
of
the
position
of
the
north
sea
was
also
unfavorable
for
the
latter
plan
to
outflank
the
austrian
right
pichegru
was
thrown
between
the
sea
and
the
mass
of
the
enemy
a
direction
as
dangerous
and
faulty
as
could
be
given
to
great
operations
this
movement
was
the
same
as
that
of
benningsen
on
the
lower
vistula
which
almost
lost
the
russian
army
in
the
fate
of
the
prussian
army
cut
off
from
its
communications
and
forced
upon
the
baltic
is
another
proof
of
this
truth
if
the
prince
of
coburg
had
acted
with
ability
he
could
easily
have
made
pichegru
suffer
for
this
audacious
maneuver
which
was
performed
a
month
before
jourdan
was
prepared
to
follow
it
up
the
center
of
the
grand
austrian
army
intended
to
act
upon
the
offensive
was
before
landrecies
the
army
was
composed
of
one
hundred
and
six
battalions
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
squadrons
upon
its
right
flank
flanders
was
covered
by
the
corps
of
clairfayt
and
upon
the
left
charleroi
was
covered
by
that
of
the
prince
de
kaunitz
the
gain
of
a
battle
before
landrecies
opened
its
gates
and
upon
general
chapuis
was
found
a
plan
of
the
diversion
in
flanders
only
were
sent
to
clairfayt
a
long
time
afterward
and
after
the
french
were
known
to
have
been
successful
the
corps
of
the
duke
of
york
marched
to
clairfayt
relief
but
what
was
the
use
of
the
remainder
of
the
army
before
landrecies
after
it
was
obliged
by
a
loss
of
force
to
delay
invasion
the
prince
of
coburg
threw
away
all
the
advantages
of
his
central
position
by
allowing
the
french
to
concentrate
in
belgium
and
to
beat
all
his
large
detachments
in
detail
finally
the
army
moved
leaving
a
division
at
cateau
and
a
part
having
been
sent
to
the
prince
de
kaunitz
at
charleroi
if
instead
of
dividing
this
grand
army
it
had
been
directed
upon
turcoing
there
would
have
been
concentrated
there
one
hundred
battalions
and
one
hundred
and
forty
squadrons
and
what
must
then
have
been
the
result
of
this
famous
diversion
of
pichegru
cut
off
from
his
own
frontiers
and
shut
up
between
the
sea
and
two
fortresses
the
plan
of
invasion
adopted
by
the
french
had
not
only
the
radical
error
of
exterior
lines
it
also
failed
in
execution
the
diversion
on
courtray
took
place
on
april
and
jourdan
did
not
arrive
at
charleroi
till
the
of
june
more
than
a
month
afterward
here
was
a
splendid
opportunity
for
the
austrians
to
profit
by
their
central
position
if
the
prussian
army
had
maneuvered
by
its
right
and
the
austrian
army
by
its
left
that
is
both
upon
the
meuse
the
state
of
affairs
would
have
been
different
by
establishing
themselves
in
the
center
of
a
line
of
scattered
forces
they
could
have
prevented
the
junction
of
the
different
fractions
it
may
be
dangerous
in
a
battle
to
attack
the
center
of
a
close
line
of
troops
when
it
can
be
simultaneously
sustained
by
the
wings
and
the
reserves
but
it
is
quite
different
on
a
line
of
three
hundred
miles
in
extent
in
prussia
and
spain
retired
from
the
coalition
and
the
principal
theater
of
war
was
shifted
from
the
rhine
to
italy
which
opened
a
new
field
of
glory
for
the
french
arms
their
lines
of
operations
in
this
campaign
were
double
they
desired
to
operate
by
dusseldorf
and
manheim
clairfayt
wiser
than
his
predecessors
concentrated
his
forces
alternately
upon
these
points
and
gained
victories
at
manheim
and
in
the
lines
of
mayence
so
decisive
that
they
caused
the
army
of
the
sambre
and
meuse
to
recross
the
rhine
to
cover
the
moselle
and
brought
pichegru
back
to
landau
in
the
lines
of
operations
on
the
rhine
were
copied
from
those
of
and
those
in
flanders
in
but
with
different
results
the
armies
of
the
rhine
and
of
the
sambre
and
meuse
set
out
from
the
extremities
of
the
base
on
routes
converging
to
the
danube
as
in
they
were
exterior
lines
the
archduke
charles
more
skillful
than
the
prince
of
coburg
profited
by
his
interior
lines
by
concentrating
his
forces
at
a
point
nearer
than
that
expected
by
the
french
he
then
seized
the
instant
when
the
danube
covered
the
corps
of
latour
to
steal
several
marches
upon
moreau
and
attack

french
armies

upon
interior
lines

reciprocal
support
while
the
austrians
are
compelled
to
adopt
an
exterior
line
which
renders
it
impossible
for
them
to
communicate

a
skillful
arrangement

the

campaigns

be

that
the
lines

operations

have
led
to
success
have
been
established
in
conformity
to
the
fundamental
principle
already
alluded

that
and
interior
lines
enable
a

to
bring
into

by
strategic
movements
upon

point
a

force

the
the
student

also
satisfy
himself
that

contained
faults
opposed
to
this
principle
an
undue
number

lines

maxims
on
lines
of
operations
from
the
analysis
of
all
the
events
herein
referred
to
as
well
as
from
that
of
many
others
the
following
maxims
result
if
the
art
of
war
consists
in
bringing
into
action
upon
the
decisive
point
of
the
theater
of
operations
the
greatest
possible
force
the
choice
of
the
line
of
operations
being
the
primary
means
of
attaining
this
end
may
be
regarded
as
the
fundamental
idea
in
a
good
plan
of
a
campaign
napoleon
proved
this
by
the
direction
he
gave
his
armies
in
on
donauwerth
and
in
on
gera
maneuvers
that
can
not
be
too
much
studied
by
military
men
of
course
it
is
impossible
to
sketch
in
advance
the
whole
campaign
the
objective
point
will
be
determined
upon
in
advance
the
general
plan
to
be
followed
to
attain
it
and
the
first
enterprise
to
be
undertaken
for
this
end
what
is
to
follow
will
depend
upon
the
result
of
this
first
operation
and
the
new
phases
it
may
develop
the
direction
to
be
given
to
this
line
depends
upon
the
geographical
situation
of
the
theater
of
operations
but
still
more
upon
the
position
of
the
hostile
masses
upon
this
strategic
field
every
case
however
it
must
be
directed
upon
the
center
or
upon
one
of
the
extremities
only
when
the
assailing
forces
are
vastly
preponderating
would
it
be
otherwise
than
a
fatal
error
to
act
upon
the
center
and
the
two
extremities
at
the
same
it
may
be
laid
down
as
a
general
principle
that
if
the
enemy
divide
his
forces
on
an
extended
front
the
best
direction
of
the
will
be
upon
his
center
but
in
every
other
case
when
it
is
possible
the
best
direction
will
be
upon
one
of
the
flanks
and
then
upon
the
rear
of
his
line
of
defense
or
front
of
operations
the
advantage
of
this
maneuver
arises
more
from
the
opportunity
it
affords
of
taking
the
line
of
defense
in
reverse
than
from
the
fact
that
by
using
it
the
assailant
has
to
contend
with
but
a
part
of
the
force
thus
the
army
of
the
rhine
in
gaining
the
extreme
left
of
the
line
of
defense
of
the
black
forest
caused
it
to
yield
almost
without
an
effort
this
army
fought
two
battles
on
the
right
bank
of
the
danube
which
although
not
decisive
yet
from
the
judicious
direction
of
the
line
of
operations
brought
about
the
invasion
of
swabia
and
bavaria
the
results
of
the
march
of
the
army
of
the
reserve
by
the
and
milan
upon
the
extreme
right
of
mélas
were
still
more
brilliant
even
when
the
extremity
of
the
enemy
front
of
operations
is
gained
it
is
not
always
safe
to
act
upon
his
rear
since
by
so
doing
the
assailant
in
many
cases
will
lose
his
own
communications
to
avoid
this
danger
the
line
of
operations
should
have
a
geographic
and
strategic
direction
such
that
the
army
will
always
find
either
to
its
rear
or
to
the
right
or
left
a
safe
line
of
retreat
in
this
case
to
take
advantage
of
either
of
these
flank
lines
of
retreat
would
require
a
change
of
direction
of
the
line
of
operations
maxim
the
ability
to
decide
upon
such
a
direction
is
among
the
most
important
qualities
of
a
general
the
importance
of
a
direction
is
illustrated
by
these
examples
if
napoleon
in
after
passing
the
had
marched
upon
asti
or
alessandria
and
had
fought
at
marengo
without
having
previously
protected
himself
on
the
side
of
lombardy
and
of
the
left
bank
of
the
po
he
would
have
been
more
thoroughly
cut
off
from
his
line
of
retreat
than
mélas
from
his
but
having
in
his
possession
the
secondary
points
of
casale
and
pavia
on
the
side
of
the
and
savona
and
tenda
toward
the
apennines
in
case
of
reverse
he
had
every
means
of
regaining
the
var
or
the
valais
in
if
he
had
marched
from
gera
directly
upon
leipsic
and
had
there
awaited
the
prussian
army
returning
from
weimar
he
would
have
been
cut
off
from
the
rhine
as
much
as
the
duke
of
brunswick
from
the
elbe
while
by
falling
back
to
the
west
in
the
direction
of
weimar
he
placed
his
front
before
the
three
roads
of
saalfeld
schleiz
and
hof
which
thus
became
lines
of
communication
if
the
prussians
had
endeavored
to
cut
him
off
from
these
lines
by
moving
between
gera
and
baireuth
they
would
have
opened
to
him
his
most
natural
line
the
excellent
road
from
leipsic
to
frankfort
as
well
as
the
two
roads
which
lead
from
saxony
by
cassel
to
coblentz
cologne
and
even
wesel
two
independent
armies
should
not
be
formed
upon
the
same
frontier
such
an
arrangement
could
be
proper
only
in
the
case
of
large
coalitions
or
where
the
forces
at
disposal
are
too
numerous
to
act
upon
the
same
zone
of
operations
and
even
in
this
case
it
would
be
better
to
have
all
the
forces
under
the
same
commander
who
accompanies
the
principal
army
as
a
consequence
of
the
principle
with
equal
forces
on
the
same
frontier
a
single
line
of
operations
will
be
more
advantageous
than
a
double
one
it
may
happen
however
that
a
double
line
will
be
necessary
either
from
the
topography
of
the
seat
of
war
or
because
a
double
line
has
been
adopted
by
the
enemy
and
it
will
be
necessary
to
oppose
a
part
of
the
army
to
each
of
his
masses
in
this
case
interior
or
central
lines
will
be
preferable
to
exterior
lines
since
in
the
former
case
the
fractions
of
the
army
can
be
concentrated
before
those
of
the
enemy
and
may
thus
decide
the
fate
of
the
campaign
such
an
army
may
by
a
strategic
plan
unite
upon
and
overwhelm
successively
the
fractions
of
the
adversary
forces
to
be
assured
of
success
in
these
maneuvers
a
body
of
observation
is
left
in
front
of
the
army
to
be
held
in
check
with
instructions
to
avoid
a
serious
engagement
but
to
delay
the
enemy
as
much
as
possible
by
taking
advantage
of
the
ground
continually
falling
back
upon
the
principal
army
a
double
line
is
applicable
in
the
case
of
a
decided
superiority
of
force
when
each
army
will
be
a
match
for
any
force
the
enemy
can
bring
against
it
in
this
case
this
course
will
be
advantageous
since
a
single
line
would
crowd
the
forces
so
much
as
to
prevent
them
all
from
acting
to
advantage
however
it
will
always
be
prudent
to
support
well
the
army
which
by
reason
of
the
nature
of
its
theater
and
the
respective
positions
of
the
parties
has
the
most
important
duty
to
perform
the
principal
events
of
modern
wars
demonstrate
the
truth
of
two
other
maxims
the
first
is
that
two
armies
operating
on
interior
lines
and
sustaining
each
other
reciprocally
and
opposing
two
armies
superior
in
numbers
should
not
allow
themselves
to
be
crowded
into
a
too
contracted
space
where
the
whole
might
be
overwhelmed
at
once
this
happened
to
napoleon
at
leipsic
the
second
is
that
interior
lines
should
not
be
abused
by
extending
them
too
far
thus
giving
the
enemy
the
opportunity
of
overcoming
the
corps
of
observation
this
risk
however
may
be
incurred
if
the
end
pursued
by
the
main
forces
is
so
decisive
as
to
conclude
the
war
when
the
fate
of
these
secondary
bodies
would
be
viewed
with
comparative
indifference
for
the
same
reason
two
converging
lines
are
more
advantageous
than
two
divergent
the
first
conform
better
to
the
principles
of
strategy
and
possess
the
advantage
of
covering
the
lines
of
communication
and
supply
but
to
be
free
from
danger
they
should
be
so
arranged
that
the
armies
which
pass
over
them
shall
not
be
separately
exposed
to
the
combined
masses
of
the
enemy
before
being
able
to
effect
their
junction
divergent
lines
however
may
be
advantageous
when
the
center
of
the
enemy
has
been
broken
and
his
forces
separated
either
by
a
battle
or
by
a
strategic
movement
in
which
case
divergent
operations
would
add
to
the
dispersion
of
the
enemy
such
divergent
lines
would
be
interior
since
the
pursuers
could
concentrate
with
more
facility
than
the
pursued
it
sometimes
happens
that
an
army
is
obliged
to
change
its
line
of
operations
in
the
middle
of
a
campaign
this
is
a
very
delicate
and
important
step
which
may
lead
to
great
successes
or
to
equally
great
disasters
if
not
applied
with
sagacity
and
is
used
only
to
extricate
an
army
from
an
embarrassing
position
napoleon
projected
several
of
these
changes
for
in
his
bold
invasions
he
was
provided
with
new
plans
to
meet
unforeseen
events
at
the
battle
of
austerlitz
if
defeated
he
had
resolved
to
adopt
a
line
of
operations
through
bohemia
on
passau
or
ratisbon
which
would
have
opened
a
new
and
rich
country
to
him
instead
of
returning
by
vienna
which
route
lay
through
an
exhausted
country
and
from
which
the
archduke
charles
was
endeavoring
to
cut
him
off
frederick
executed
one
of
these
changes
of
the
line
of
operations
after
the
raising
of
the
siege
of
olmutz
in
napoleon
commenced
the
execution
of
a
bolder
maneuver
but
one
which
was
favored
by
the
localities
it
was
to
base
himself
upon
the
fortresses
of
alsace
and
lorraine
leaving
the
route
to
paris
open
to
the
allies
if
mortier
and
marmont
could
have
joined
him
and
had
he
possessed
fifty
thousand
more
men
this
plan
would
have
produced
the
most
decisive
results
and
have
put
the
seal
on
his
military
career
as
before
stated
the
outline
of
the
frontiers
and
the
geographical
character
of
the
theater
of
operations
exercise
a
great
influence
on
the
direction
to
be
given
to
these
lines
as
well
as
upon
the
advantages
to
be
obtained
central
positions
salient
toward
the
enemy
like
bohemia
and
switzerland
are
the
most
advantageous
because
they
naturally
lead
to
the
adoption
of
interior
lines
and
facilitate
the
project
of
taking
the
enemy
in
reverse
the
sides
of
this
salient
angle
become
so
important
that
every
means
should
be
taken
to
render
them
impregnable
in
default
of
such
central
positions
their
advantages
may
be
gained
by
the
relative
directions
of
as

the
general

also
to
influence
the
direction
to
be
given
to
the
lines
of
operations
these
latter
being
naturally
dependent
upon
the
former
it
has
already
been
shown
that
the
greatest
advantage
that
can
result
from
a
choice
of
bases
is
when
the
frontiers
allow
it
to
be
assumed
parallel
to
the
line
of
operations
of
the
enemy
thus
affording
the
opportunity
of
seizing
this
line
and
cutting
him
from
his
base
but
if
instead
of
directing
the
operations
upon
the
decisive
point
the
line
of
operations
be
badly
chosen
all
the
advantages
of
the
perpendicular
base
may
be
lost
as
will
be
seen
by

toward

instead
of
to
the
right
toward
g
h
would
lose
all
the
strategic
advantages
of
its
base
c
the
great
art
then
of
properly
directing
lines
of
operations
is
so
to
establish
them
in
reference
to
the
bases
and
to
the
marches
of
the
army
as
to
seize
the
communications
of
the
enemy
without
imperiling
own
and
is
the
most
important
and
most
difficult
problem
in
strategy
there
is
another
point
which
exercises
a
manifest
influence
over
the
direction
to
be
given
to
the
line
of
operations
it
is
when
the
principal
enterprise
of
the
campaign
is
to
cross
a
large
river
in
the
presence
of
a
numerous
and
enemy
in
this
case
the
choice
of
this
line
depends
neither
upon
the
will
of
the
general
nor
the
advantages
to
be
gained
by
an
attack
on
one
or
another
point
for
the
first
consideration
will
be
to
ascertain
where
the
passage
can
be
most
certainly
effected
and
where
are
to
be
found
the
means
for
this
purpose
the
passage
of
the
rhine
in
by
jourdan
was
near
dusseldorf
for
the
same
reason
that
the
vistula
in
was
crossed
by
marshal
paskevitch
near
ossiek
that
in
neither
case
was
there
the
necessary
for
the
purpose
and
both
were
obliged
to
procure
and
take
up
the
rivers
large
boats
bought
by
the
french
in
holland
and
by
the
russians
at
thorn
and
dantzic
the
neutrality
of
prussia
permitted
the
ascent
of
the
river
in
both
cases
and
the
enemy
was
not
able
to
prevent
it
this
apparently
incalculable
advantage
led
the
french
into
the
double
invasions
of
and
which
failed
because
the
double
line
of
operations
caused
the
defeat
of
the
armies
separately
paskevitch
was
wiser
and
passed
the
upper
vistula
with
only
a
small
detachment
and
after
the
principal
army
had
already
arrived
at
lowicz
when
an
army
is
sufficiently
provided
with
the
chances
of
failure
are
much
lessened
but
then
as
always
it
is
necessary
to
select
the
point
which
may
either
on
account
of
its
topography
or
the
position
of
the
enemy
be
most
advantageous
the
discussion
between
napoleon
and
moreau
on
the
passage
of
the
rhine
in
is
one
of
the
most
curious
examples
of
the
different
combinations
presented
by
this
question
which
is
both
strategic
and
tactical
since
it
is
necessary
to
protect
the
bridges
at
least
until
a
victory
is
gained
the
point
of
passage
will
exercise
an
influence
upon
the
directions
of
a
few
marches
immediately
subsequent
to
the
passage
the
point
selected
in
every
case
for
the
principal
passage
will
be
upon
the
center
or
one
of
the
flanks
of
the
enemy
a
united
army
which
has
forced
a
passage
upon
the
center
of
an
extended
line
might
afterward
adopt
two
divergent
lines
to
complete
the
dispersion
of
the
enemy
who
being
unable
to
concentrate
would
not
think
of
disturbing
the
bridges
if
the
line
of
the
river
is
so
short
that
the
hostile
army
is
more
concentrated
and
the
general
has
the
means
of
taking
up
after
the
passage
a
front
perpendicular
to
the
river
it
would
be
better
to
pass
it
upon
one
of
the
extremities
in
order
to
throw
off
the
enemy
from
the
bridges
this
will
be
referred
to
in
the
article
upon
the
passage
of
rivers
there
is
yet
another
combination
of
lines
of
operations
to
be
noticed
it
is
the
marked
difference
of
advantage
between
a
line
at
home
and
one
in
a
hostile
country
the
nature
of
the
enemy
country
will
also
influence
these
chances
let
us
suppose
an
army
crosses
the
alps
or
the
rhine
to
carry
on
war
in
italy
or
germany
it
encounters
states
of
the
second
rank
and
even
if
they
are
in
alliance
there
are
always
rivalries
or
collisions
of
interest
which
will
deprive
them
of
that
unity
and
strength
possessed
by
a
single
powerful
state
on
the
other
hand
a
german
army
invading
france
would
operate
upon
a
line
much
more
dangerous
than
that
of
the
french
in
italy
because
upon
the
first
could
be
thrown
the
consolidated
strength
of
franco
united
in
feeling
and
interest
an
army
on
the
defensive
with
its
line
of
operations
on
its
own
soil
has
resources
everywhere
and
in
every
thing
the
inhabitants
authorities
productions
towns
public
depots
and
arsenals
and
even
private
stores
are
all
in
its
favor
it
is
not
ordinarily
so
abroad
lines
of
operations
in
rich
fertile
manufacturing
regions
offer
to
the
assailants
much
greater
advantages
than
when
in
barren
or
desert
regions
particularly
when
the
people
are
not
united
against
the
invader
in
provinces
like
those
first
named
the
army
would
find
a
thousand
necessary
supplies
while
in
the
other
huts
and
straw
are
about
the
only
resources
horses
probably
may
obtain
pasturage
but
every
thing
else
must
be
carried
by
the
army
thus
infinitely
increasing
the
embarrassments
and
rendering
bold
operations
much
more
rare
and
dangerous
the
french
armies
so
long
accustomed
to
the
comforts
of
swabia
and
lombardy
almost
perished
in
in
the
bogs
of
pultusk
and
actually
did
perish
in
in
the
marshy
forests
of
lithuania
there
is
another
point
in
reference
to
these
lines
which
is
much
insisted
upon
by
some
but
which
is
more
specious
than
important
it
is
that
on
each
side
of
the
line
of
operations
the
country
should
be
cleared
of
all
enemies
for
a
distance
equal
to
the
depth
of
this
line
otherwise
the
enemy
might
threaten
the
line
of
retreat
this
rule
is
everywhere
belied
by
the
events
of
war
the
nature
of
the
country
the
rivers
and
mountains
the
morale
of
the
armies
the
spirit
of
the
people
the
ability
and
energy
of
the
commanders
can
not
be
estimated
by
diagrams
on
paper
it
is
true
that
no
considerable
bodies
of
the
enemy
could
be
permitted
on
the
flanks
of
the
line
of
retreat
but
a
compliance
with
this
demand
would
deprive
an
army
of
every
means
of
taking
a
step
in
a
hostile
country
and
there
is
not
a
campaign
in
recent
wars
or
in
those
of
marlborough
and
eugene
which
does
not
contradict
this
assertion
was
not
general
moreau
at
the
gates
of
vienna
when
fussen
scharnitz
and
all
the
tyrol
were
in
possession
of
the
austrians
was
not
napoleon
at
piacenza
when
turin
genoa
and
the
were
occupied
by
the
army
of
mélas
did
not
eugene
march
by
way
of
stradella
and
asti
to
the
aid
of
turin
leaving
the
french
upon
the
mincio
but
a
few
leagues
from
his
base
observations
upon
interior
lines
what
has
been
said
against
them
some
of
my
critics
have
disputed
as
to
the
meaning
of
words
and
upon
definitions
others
have
censured
where
they
but
imperfectly
understood
and
others
have
by
the
light
of
certain
important
events
taken
it
upon
themselves
to
deny
my
fundamental
principles
without
inquiring
whether
the
conditions
of
the
case
which
might
modify
the
application
of
these
principles
were
such
as
were
supposed
or
without
reflecting
that
even
admitting
what
they
claimed
to
be
true
a
single
exception
can
not
disprove
a
rule
based
upon
the
experience
of
ages
and
upon
natural
principles
in
opposition
to
my
maxims
upon
interior
lines
some
have
quoted
the
famous
and
successful
march
of
the
allies
upon
leipsic
this
remarkable
event
at
first
glance
seems
to
stagger
the
faith
of
those
who
believe
in
principles
at
best
however
it
is
but
one
of
those
exceptional
cases
from
which
nothing
can
be
inferred
in
the
face
of
thousands
of
opposed
instances
moreover
it
is
easy
to
show
that
far
from
overthrowing
the
maxims
it
has
been
brought
to
oppose
it
will
go
to
establish
their
soundness
indeed
the
critics
had
forgotten
that
in
case
of
a
considerable
numerical
superiority
i
recommended
double
lines
of
operations
as
most
advantageous
particularly
when
concentric
and
arranged
to
combine
an
effort
against
the
enemy
at
the
decisive
moment
now
in
the
allied
armies
of
schwarzenberg
blücher
bernadotte
and
benningsen
this
case
of
decided
superiority
is
found
the
inferior
army
to
conform
to
the
principles
of
this
chapter
should
have
directed
its
efforts
against
one
of
the
extremities
of
his
adversary
and
not
upon
the
center
as
it
did
so
that
the
events
quoted
against
me
are
doubly
in
my
favor
moreover
if
the
central
position
of
napoleon
between
dresden
and
the
oder
was
disastrous
it
must
be
attributed
to
the
misfortunes
of
culm
katzbach
and
dennewitz
in
a
word
to
faults
of
execution
entirely
foreign
to
the
principles
in
question
what
i
propose
is
to
act
offensively
upon
the
most
important
point
with
the
greater
part
of
the
forces
but
upon
the
secondary
points
to
remain
on
the
defensive
in
strong
positions
or
behind
a
river
until
the
decisive
blow
is
struck
and
the
operation
ended
by
the
total
defeat
of
an
essential
part
of
the
army
then
the
combined
efforts
of
the
whole
army
may
be
directed
upon
other
points
whenever
the
secondary
armies
are
exposed
to
a
decisive
shock
during
the
absence
of
the
mass
of
the
army
the
system
is
not
understood
and
this
was
what
happened
in
if
napoleon
after
his
victory
at
dresden
had
vigorously
pursued
the
allies
into
bohemia
he
would
have
escaped
the
disaster
at
culm
have
threatened
prague
and
perhaps
have
dissolved
the
coalition
to
this
error
may
be
added
a
fault
quite
as
great
that
of
fighting
decisive
battles
when
he
was
not
present
with
the
mass
of
his
forces
at
katzbach
his
instructions
were
not
obeyed
he
ordered
macdonald
to
wait
for
blücher
and
to
fall
upon
him
when
he
should
expose
himself
by
hold
movements
macdonald
on
the
contrary
crossed
his
detachments
over
torrents
which
were
hourly
becoming
more
swollen
and
advanced
to
meet
blücher
if
he
had
fulfilled
his
instructions
and
napoleon
had
followed
up
his
victory
there
is
no
doubt
that
his
plan
of
operations
based
upon
interior
strategic
lines
and
positions
and
upon
a
concentric
line
of
operations
would
have
met
with
the
most
brilliant
success
the
study
of
his
campaigns
in
italy
in
and
in
france
in
shows
that
he
knew
how
to
apply
this
system
there
is
another
circumstance
of
equal
importance
which
shows
the
injustice
of
judging
central
lines
by
the
fate
of
napoleon
in
saxony
viz
his
front
of
operations
was
outflanked
on
the
right
and
even
taken
in
reverse
by
the
geographical
position
of
the
frontiers
of
such
a
case
is
of
rare
occurrence
a
central
position
with
such
faults
is
not
to
be
compared
to
one
without
them
when
napoleon
made
the
application
of
these
principles
in
italy
poland
prussia
and
france
he
was
not
exposed
to
the
attack
of
a
hostile
enemy
on
his
flanks
and
rear
austria
could
have
threatened
him
in
but
she
was
then
at
peace
with
him
and
unarmed
to
judge
of
a
system
of
operations
it
must
be
supposed
that
accidents
and
chances
are
to
be
as
much
in
favor
of
as
against
it
which
was
by
no
means
the
case
in
either
in
the
geographic
positions
or
in
the
state
of
the
respective
forces
independently
of
this
it
is
absurd
to
quote
the
reverses
at
katzbach
and
dennewitz
suffered
by
his
lieutenants
as
proof
capable
of
destroying
a
principle
the
simplest
application
of
which
required
these
officers
not
to
allow
themselves
to
be
drawn
into
a
serious
engagement
instead
of
avoiding
they
sought
collisions
indeed
what
advantage
can
be
expected
from
the
system
of
central
lines
if
the
parts
of
the
army
which
have
been
weakened
in
order
to
strike
decisive
blows
elsewhere
shall
themselves
seek
a
disastrous
contest
instead
of
being
contented
with
being
bodies
of
observation
in
this
case
it
is
the
enemy
who
applies
the
principle
and
not
he
who
has
the
interior
lines
moreover
in
the
succeeding
campaign
the
defense
of
napoleon
in
champagne
from
the
battle
of
brienne
to
that
of
paris
demonstrates
fully
the
truth
of
these
maxims
the
analysis
of
these
two
celebrated
campaigns
raises
a
strategic
question
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
answer
by
simple
assertions
founded
upon
theories
it
is
whether
the
system
of
central
lines
loses
its
advantages
when
the
masses
are
very
large
agreeing
with
montesquieu
that
the
greatest
enterprises
fail
from
the
magnitude
of
the
arrangements
necessary
to
consummate
them
i
am
disposed
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
it
is
very
clear
to
me
that
an
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
occupying
a
central
zone
against
three
isolated
armies
of
thirty
or
thousand
men
would
be
more
sure
of
defeating
them
successively
than
if
the
central
mass
were
four
hundred
thousand
strong
against
three
armies
of
one
hundred
and
thousand
each
and
for
several
good
reasons
considering
the
difficulty
of
finding
ground
and
time
necessary
to
bring
a
very
large
force
into
action
on
the
day
of
battle
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
or
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
men
may
easily
resist
a
much
larger
force
if
driven
from
the
field
there
will
be
at
least
one
hundred
thousand
men
to
protect
and
insure
an
orderly
retreat
and
effect
a
junction
with
one
of
the
other
armies
the
central
army
of
four
hundred
thousand
men
requires
such
a
quantity
of
provisions
munitions
horses
and
of
every
kind
that
it
will
possess
less
mobility
and
facility
in
shifting
its
efforts
from
one
part
of
the
zone
to
another
to
say
nothing
of
the
impossibility
of
obtaining
provisions
from
a
region
too
restricted
to
support
such
numbers
the
bodies
of
observation
detached
from
the
central
mass
to
hold
in
check
two
armies
of
one
hundred
and
thousand
each
must
be
very
strong
from
eighty
to
ninety
thousand
each
and
being
of
such
magnitude
if
they
are
drawn
into
a
serious
engagement
they
will
probably
suffer
reverses
the
effects
of
which
might
outweigh
the
advantages
gained
by
the
principal
army
i
have
never
advocated
exclusively
either
a
concentric
or
eccentric
system
all
my
works
go
to
show
the
eternal
influence
of
principles
and
to
demonstrate
that
operations
to
be
successful
must
be
applications
of
principles
divergent
or
convergent
operations
may
be
either
very
good
or
very
bad
all
depends
on
the
situation
of
the
respective
forces
the
eccentric
lines
for
instance
are
good
when
applied
to
a
mass
starting
from
a
given
point
and
acting
in
divergent
directions
to
divide
and
separately
destroy
two
hostile
forces
acting
upon
exterior
lines
such
was
the
maneuver
of
frederick
which
brought
about
at
the
end
of
the
campaign
of
the
fine
battles
of
rossbach
and
leuthen
such
were
nearly
all
the
operations
of
napoleon
whose
favorite
maneuver
was
to
unite
by
marches
imposing
masses
on
the
center
and
having
pierced
the
enemy
center
or
turned
his
front
to
give
them
eccentric
directions
to
disperse
the
defeated
army
on
the
other
hand
concentric
operations
are
good
in
two
cases
when
they
tend
to
concentrate
a
scattered
army
upon
a
point
where
it
will
be
sure
to
arrive
before
the
enemy
when
they
direct
to
the
same
end
the
efforts
of
two
armies
which
are
in
no
danger
of
being
beaten
separately
by
a
stronger
enemy
concentric
operations
which
just
now
seem
to
be
so
advantageous
may
be
most
pernicious
which
should
teach
us
the
necessity
of
detecting
the
principles
upon
which
systems
are
based
and
not
to
confound
principles
and
systems
as
for
instance
if
two
armies
set
out
from
a
distant
base
to
march
convergently
upon
an
enemy
whose
forces
are
on
interior
lines
and
more
concentrated
it
follows
that
the
latter
could
effect
a
union
before
the
former
and
would
inevitably
defeat
them
as
was
the
case
with
moreau
and
jourdan
in
opposed
to
the
archduke
charles
in
starting
from
the
same
points
or
from
two
points
much
less
separated
than
dusseldorf
and
strasbourg
an
army
may
be
exposed
to
this
danger
what
was
the
fate
of
the
concentric
columns
of
wurmser
and
quasdanovitch
wishing
to
reach
the
mincio
by
the
two
banks
of
lake
garda
can
the
result
of
the
march
of
napoleon
and
grouchy
on
brussels
be
forgotten
leaving
sombref
they
were
to
march
concentrically
on
this
city
one
by
the
other
by
wavre
blücher
and
wellington
taking
an
interior
strategic
line
effected
a
junction
before
them
and
the
terrible
disaster
of
waterloo
proved
to
the
world
that
the
immutable
principles
of
war
can
not
be
violated
with
impunity
such
events
prove
better
than
any
arguments
that
a
system
which
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
war
can
not
be
good
i
lay
no
claim
to
the
creation
of
these
principles
for
they
have
always
existed
and
were
applied
by
cæsar
scipio
and
the
consul
nero
as
well
as
by
marlborough
and
eugene
but
i
claim
to
have
been
the
first
to
point
them
out
and
to
lay
down
the
principal
chances
in
their
various
applications
footnotes
footnote
this
definition
has
been
criticized
and
as
it
has
given
rise
to
misapprehension
it
becomes
necessary
to
explain
it
in
the
first
place
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
it
is
a
question
of
that
is
of
strategic
combinations
and
not
of
great
routes
it
must
also
be
admitted
that
an
army
marching
upon
two
or
three
routes
near
enough
to
each
other
to

was
composed
of
two

radii

the
operation
was
not

some
german
writers
have
said
that
i
confound
central
positions

army
may
occupy
a
central
position
in
the
presence
of
two
masses
of
the
enemy

not

the
reasoning
in

is
plausible
if
we
conceive
the

to
be
a
circle

as
every

is
after
all

simply
a

the
fate
of
napoleon

he
had
no

all
europe

the
french
people
had
in

separated
their
cause

the

strictly
speaking
had

a

armies
were

it
will
not
be
thought

that
i
sometimes
approve
of
concentric
and
at

divergent
maneuvers
when
we
reflect
that
among
the
finest
operations
of
napoleon
there
are

strategic
lines
mention
has
already
been
made
of
strategic
lines
of
maneuvers
which
differ
essentially
from
lines
of
operations
and
it
will
be
well
to
define
them
for
many
confound
them
we
will
not
consider
those
strategic
lines
which
have
a
great
and
permanent
importance
by
reason
of
their
position
and
their
relation
to
the
features
of
the
country
like
the
lines
of
the
danube
and
the
meuse
the
chains
of
the
alps
and
the
balkan
such
lines
can
best
be
studied
by
a
detailed
and
minute
examination
of
the
topography
of
europe
and
an
excellent
model
for
this
kind
of
study
is
found
in
the
archduke
charles
description
of
southern
germany
the
term
is
also
applied
to
all
communications
which
lead
by
the
most
direct
or
advantageous
route
from
one
important
point
to
another
as
well
as
from
the
strategic
front
of
the
army
to
all
of
its
objective
points
it
will
be
seen
then
that
a
theater
of
war
is
crossed
by
a
multitude
of
such
lines
but
that
at
any
given
time
those
only
which
are
concerned
in
the
projected
enterprise
have
any
real
importance
this
renders
plain
the
distinction
between
the
general
line
of
operations
of
a
whole
campaign
and
these
lines
which
are
temporary
and
change
with
the
operations
of
the
army
besides
territorial
strategic
lines
there
are
lines
of
an
army
having
germany
as
its
general
field
might
adopt
as
its
zone
of
operations
the
space
between
the
alps
and
the
danube
or
that
between
the
danube
and
the
main
or
that
between
the
mountains
of
franconia
and
the
sea
it
would
have
upon
its
zone
a
single
line
of
operations
or
at
most
a
double
concentric
line
upon
interior
or
perhaps
exterior
directions
while
it
would
have
successively
perhaps
twenty
strategic
lines
as
its
enterprises
were
developed
it
would
have
at
first
one
for
each
wing
which
would
join
the
general
line
of
operations
if
it
operated
in
the
zone
between
the
danube
and
the
alps
it
might
adopt
according
to
events
the
strategic
line
leading
from
ulm
on
donauwerth
and
ratisbon
or
that
from
ulm
to
the
tyrol
or
that
which
connects
ulm
with
nuremberg
or
mayence
it
may
then
be
assumed
that
the
definitions
applied
to
lines
of
operations
as
well
as
the
maxims
referring
to
them
are
necessarily
applicable
to
strategic
lines
these
may
be
to
inflict
a
decisive
blow
or
after
victory
they
are
rarely
since
an
army
does
not
confine
its
march
to
a
single
road
but
when
they
are
double
or
triple
or
even
quadruple
they
should
be
if
the
forces
be
equal
or
in
the
case
of
great
numerical
superiority
the
rigorous
application
of
this
rule
may
perhaps
sometimes
be
remitted
in
detaching
a
body
on
an
exterior
line
even
when
the
forces
are
equal
to
attain
an
important
result
without
running
much
risk
but
this
is
an
affair
of
detachments
and
does
not
refer
to
the
important
masses
strategic
lines
can
not
be
interior
when
our
efforts
are
directed
against
one
of
the
extremities
of
the
enemy
front
of
operations
the
maxims
above
given
in
reference
to
lines
of
operations
holding
good
for
strategic
lines
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
them
or
to
apply
them
to
particular
examples
but
there
is
one
however
which
deserves
mention
viz
that
it
is
important
generally
in
the
selection
of
these
temporary
strategic
lines
not
to
leave
the
line
of
operations
exposed
to
the
assaults
of
the
enemy
even
this
may
however
be
done
to
extricate
the
army
from
great
danger
or
to
attain
a
great
success
but
the
operation
must
be
of
short
duration
and
care
must
have
been
taken
to
prepare
a
plan
of
safe
retreat
by
a
sudden
change
of
the
line
of
operations
if
necessary
as
has
already
been
referred
to
we
will
illustrate
this
by
the
campaign
of
waterloo
the
prussian
army
was
based
upon
the
rhine
its
line
of
operations
extended
from
cologne
and
coblentz
on
luxembourg
and
namur
wellington
base
was
antwerp
and
his
line
of
operations
the
short
road
to
brussels
the
sudden
attack
by
napoleon
on
flanders
decided
blücher
to
receive
battle
parallel
to
the
english
base
and
not
to
his
own
about
which
he
seemed
to
have
no
uneasiness
this
was
pardonable
because
he
could
always
have
a
good
chance
of
regaining
wesel
or
nimeguen
and
even
might
seek
a
refuge
in
antwerp
in
the
last
extremity
but
if
the
army
had
not
had
its
powerful
maritime
allies
it
would
have
been
destroyed
beaten
at
ligny
and
seeking
refuge
at
gembloux
and
then
at
wavre
blücher
had
but
three
strategic
lines
to
choose
from
that
which
led
directly
to
maestricht
that
farther
north
on
venloo
or
the
one
leading
to
the
english
army
near
mont
jean
he
audaciously
took
the
last
and
triumphed
by
the
application
of
interior
strategic
lines
which
napoleon
here
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
neglected
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
the
line
followed
from
gembloux
by
wavre
to
mont
jean
was
neither
a
line
of
operations
of
the
prussian
army
nor
a
line
of
battle
but
a
line
of
and
was
interior
it
was
bold
because
he
exposed
fully
his
own
natural
line
of
operations
the
fact
that
he
sought
a
junction
with
the
english
made
his
movement
accord
with
the
principles
of
war
a
less
successful
example
was
that
of
ney
at
dennewitz
leaving
wittenberg
and
going
in
the
direction
of
berlin
he
moved
to
the
right
to
gain
the
extreme
left
of
the
allies
but
in
so
doing
he
left
his
primitive
line
of
retreat
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
an
enemy
superior
in
force
his
object
was
to
gain
communication
with
napoleon
whose
intention
was
to
join
him
by
herzberg
or
luckau
but
ney
should
from
the
beginning
have
taken
all
logistic
and
tactical
means
of
accomplishing
this
change
of
strategic
line
and
of
informing
his
army
of
it
he
did
nothing
of
this
kind
either
from
forgetfulness
or
on
account
of
the
feeling
of
aversion
he
had
to
any
thing
like
a
retreat
and
the
severe
losses
at
dennewitz
were
the
result
napoleon
in
gave
one
of
the
best
illustrations
of
these
different
combinations
of
strategic
lines
his
general
line
of
operations
extended
from
the
apennines
to
verona
when
he
had
driven
wurmser
upon
roveredo
and
determined
to
pursue
him
into
the
tyrol
he
pushed
on
in
the
valley
of
the
adige
to
trent
and
the
lavis
where
he
learned
that
wurmser
had
moved
by
the
brenta
on
the
frioul
doubtless
to
take
him
in
reverse
there
were
but
three
courses
open
to
him
to
remain
in
the
narrow
valley
of
the
adige
at
great
risk
to
retreat
by
verona
to
meet
wurmser
or
the
last
which
was
sublime
but
rash
to
follow
him
into
the
valley
of
the
brenta
which
was
encircled
by
rugged
mountains
whose
two
passages
might
be
held
by
the
austrians
napoleon
was
not
the
man
to
hesitate
between
three
such
alternatives
he
left
vaubois
on
the
lavis
to
cover
trent
and
marched
with
the
remainder
of
his
forces
on
bassano
the
brilliant
results
of
this
bold
step
are
well
known
the
route
from
trent
to
bassano
was
not
the
line
of
operations
of
the
army
but
a
line
of
still
bolder
than
that
of
blücher
on
wavre
however
it
was
an
operation
of
only
three
or
four
days
duration
at
the
end
of
which
time
napoleon
would
either
beat
or
be
beaten
at
bassano
in
the
first
case
he
would
open
direct
communication
with
verona
and
his
line
of
operations
in
the
second
he
could
regain
in
great
haste
trent
where
reinforced
by
vaubois
he
could
fall
back
either
upon
verona
or
peschiera
the
difficulties
of
the
country
which
made
this
march
audacious
in
one
respect
were
favorable
in
another
for
even
if
wurmser
had
been
victorious
at
bassano
he
could
not
have
interfered
with
the
return
to
trent
as
there
was
no
road
to
enable
him
to
anticipate
napoleon
if
davidovitch
on
the
lavis
had
driven
vaubois
from
trent
he
might
have
embarrassed
napoleon
but
this
austrian
general
previously
beaten
at
roveredo
and
ignorant
of
what
the
french
army
was
doing
for
several
days
and
thinking
it
was
all
upon
him
would
scarcely
have
thought
of
resuming
the
offensive
before
napoleon
beaten
at
bassano
would
have
been
on
his
retreat
indeed
if
davidovitch
had
advanced
as
far
as
roveredo
driving
vaubois
before
him
he
would
there
have
been
surrounded
by
two
french
armies
who
would
have
inflicted
upon
him
the
fate
of
vandamme
at
culm
i
have
dwelt
on
this
event
to
show
that
a
proper
calculation
of
time
and
distances
joined
to
great
activity
may
lead
to
the
success
of
many
adventures
which
may
seem
very
imprudent
i
conclude
from
this
that
it
may
be
well
sometimes
to
direct
an
army
upon
a
route
which
exposes
its
line
of
operations
but
that
every
measure
must
be
taken
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
profiting
by
it
both
by
great
rapidity
of
execution
and
by
demonstrations
which
will
deceive
him
and
leave
him
in
ignorance
of
what
is
taking
place
still
it
is
a
very
hazardous
maneuver
and
only
to
be
adopted
under
an
urgent
necessity

would
have
had

base
on
the
elbe
in
if
austria
had
remained
neutral
but
she
having
joined
his
enemies
this
line
was
taken
in
reverse
and
became
but
a
pivot
of
operations
favorable
indeed
for
the
execution
of
a
single
enterprise
but
dangerous
for
a
prolonged
occupation
particularly
in
case
of
a
serious
reverse
as
every
army
which
is

in
an
enemy
country
is
exposed
to
the
danger
of
being
cut
off
from
its
own

if
it
continues

we
can

the
deficiency
must
be
supplied
by

invention
its

every

a

on

nature
of
the
frontiers
and

gained
it

it
is
true
that
to
form
a

a
number

must
be

tone
a
reserve
may
be
formed
capable
of
important
service
napoleon
never
failed
to
organize
these
reserves
in
his
campaigns
even
in
in
his
bold
march
on
the
noric
alps
he
had
first
joubert
on
the
adige
afterward
victor
returning
from
the
roman
states
in
the
neighborhood
of
verona
in
ney
and
augereau
played
the
part
alternately
in
the
tyrol
and
bavaria
and
mortier
and
marmont
near
vienna
in
napoleon
formed
like
reserves
on
the
rhine
and
mortier
used
them
to
reduce
hesse
at
the
same
time
other
reserves
were
forming
at
mayence
under
kellermann
which
took
post
as
fast
as
organized
between
the
rhine
and
elbe
while
mortier
was
sent
into
pomerania
when
napoleon
decided
to
push
on
to
the
vistula
in
the
same
year
he
directed
with
much
ostentation
the
concentration
of
an
army
on
the
elbe
sixty
thousand
strong
its
object
being
to
protect
hamburg
against
the
english
and
to
influence
austria
whose
disposition
was
as
manifest
as
her
interests
the
prussians
established
a
similar
reserve
in
at
halle
but
it
was
badly
posted
if
it
had
been
established
upon
the
elbe
at
wittenberg
or
dessau
and
had
done
its
duty
it
might
have
saved
the
army
by
giving
prince
hohenlohe
and
blücher
time
to
reach
berlin
or
at
least
stettin
these
reserves
are
particularly
useful
when
the
configuration
of
the
country
leads
to
double
fronts
of
operations
they
then
fulfill
the
double
object
of
observing
the
second
front
and
in
case
of
necessity
of
aiding
the
operations
of
the
main
army
when
the
enemy
threatens
its
flanks
or
a
reverse
compels
it
to
fall
back
toward
this
reserve
of
course
care
must
be
taken
not
to
create
dangerous
detachments
and
whenever
these
reserves
can
be
dispensed
with
it
should
be
done
or
the
troops
in
the
depots
only
be
employed
as
reserves
it
is
only
in
distant
invasions
and
sometimes
on
our
own
soil
that
they
are
useful
if
the
scene
of
hostilities
be
but
five
or
six
marches
distant
from
the
frontier
they
are
quite
superfluous
at
home
they
may
generally
be
dispensed
with
it
is
only
in
the
case
of
a
serious
invasion
when
new
levies
are
organizing
that
such
a
reserve
in
an
intrenched
camp
under
the
protection
of
a
fortress
which
serves
as
a
great
depot
will
be
indispensable
the
general
talents
will
be
exercised
in
judging
of
the
use
of
these
reserves
according
to
the
state
of
the
country
the
length
of
the
line
of
operations
the
nature
of
the
fortified
points
and
the
proximity
of
a
hostile
state
he
also
decides
upon
their
position
and
endeavors
to
use
for
this
purpose
troops
which
will
not
weaken
his
main
army
so
much
as
the
withdrawal
of
his
good
troops
these
reserves
ought
to
hold
the
most
important
points
between
the
base
and
front
of
operations
occupy
the
fortified
places
if
any
have
been
reduced
observe
or
invest
those
which
are
held
by
the
enemy
and
if
there
be
no
fortress
as
a
point
of
support
they
should
throw
up
intrenched
camps
or
de
to
protect
the
depots
and
to
increase
the
strength
of
their
positions
all
that
has
been
said
upon
pivots
of
operations
is
applicable
to
temporary
bases
and
to
strategic
reserves
which
will
be
doubly
valuable
if
they
possess
such
pivots
article
xxiv
the
old
system
of
wars
of
position
and
the
modern
system
of
marches
the
system
of
is
understood
the
old
manner
of
conducting
a
methodical
war
with
armies
in
tents
with
their
supplies
at
hand
engaged
in
watching
each
other
one
besieging
a
city
the
other
covering
it
one
perhaps
endeavoring
to
acquire
a
small
province
the
other
counteracting
its
efforts
by
occupying
strong
points
such
was
war
from
the
middle
ages
to
the
era
of
the
french
revolution
during
this
revolution
great
changes
transpired
and
many
systems
of
more
or
less
value
sprang
up
war
was
commenced
in
as
it
had
been
in
the
french
encamped
near
their
strong
places
and
the
allies
besieged
them
it
was
not
till
when
assailed
from
without
and
within
that
this
system
was
changed
thoroughly
aroused
france
threw
one
million
men
in
fourteen
armies
upon
her
enemies
these
armies
had
neither
tents
provisions
nor
money
on
their
marches
they
bivouacked
or
were
quartered
in
towns
their
mobility
was
increased
and
became
a
means
of
success
their
tactics
changed
also
the
troops
were
put
in
columns
which
were
more
easily
handled
than
deployed
lines
and
on
account
of
the
broken
character
of
the
country
of
flanders
and
the
vosges
they
threw
out
a
part
of
their
force
as
skirmishers
to
protect
and
cover
the
columns
this
system
which
was
thus
the
result
of
circumstances
at
first
met
with
a
success
beyond
all
expectation
it
disconcerted
the
methodical
austrian
and
prussian
troops
as
well
as
their
generals
mack
to
whom
was
attributed
the
success
of
the
prince
of
coburg
increased
his
reputation
by
directing
the
troops
to
extend
their
lines
to
oppose
an
open
order
to
the
fire
of
skirmishers
it
had
never
occurred
to
the
poor
man
that
while
the
skirmishers
made
the
noise
the
columns
carried
the
positions
the
first
generals
of
the
republic
were
and
nothing
more
the
principal
direction
of
affairs
was
in
the
hands
of
carnot
and
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
it
was
sometimes
judicious
but
often
bad
carnot
was
the
author
of
one
of
the
finest
strategic
movements
of
the
war
in
he
sent
a
reserve
of
fine
troops
successively
to
the
aid
of
dunkirk
maubeuge
and
landau
so
that
this
small
force
moving
rapidly
from
point
to
point
and
aided
by
the
troops
already
collected
at
these
different
points
compelled
the
enemy
to
evacuate
france
the
campaign
of
opened
badly
it
was
the
force
of
circumstances
and
not
a
premeditated
plan
which
brought
about
the
strategic
movement
of
the
army
of
the
moselle
on
the
sambre
and
it
was
this
which
led
to
the
success
of
fleurus
and
the
conquest
of
belgium
in
the
mistakes
of
the
french
were
so
great
that
they
were
imputed
to
treachery
the
austrians
on
the
contrary
were
better
commanded
by
clairfayt
chateler
and
schmidt
than
they
had
been
by
mack
and
the
prince
of
coburg
the
archduke
charles
applying
the
principle
of
interior
lines
triumphed
over
moreau
and
jourdan
in
by
a
single
march
up
to
this
time
the
fronts
of
the
french
armies
had
been
large
either
to
procure
subsistence
more
easily
or
because
the
generals
thought
it
better
to
put
all
the
divisions
in
line
leaving
it
to
their
commanders
to
arrange
them
for
battle
the
reserves
were
small
detachments
incapable
of
redeeming
the
day
even
if
the
enemy
succeeded
in
overwhelming
but
a
single
division
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
napoleon
made
his
in
italy
his
activity
from
the
beginning
worsted
the
austrians
and
piedmontese
free
from
useless
incumbrances
his
troops
surpassed
in
mobility
all
modern
armies
he
conquered
the
italian
peninsula
by
a
series
of
marches
and
strategic
combats
his
march
on
vienna
in
was
rash
but
justified
by
the
necessity
of
overcoming
the
archduke
charles
before
he
could
receive
reinforcements
from
the
rhine
the
campaign
of
still
more
characteristic
of
the
man
marked
a
new
era
in
the
conception
of
plans
of
campaign
and
lines
of
operations
he
adopted
bold
objective
points
which
looked
to
nothing
less
than
the
capture
or
destruction
of
whole
armies
the
orders
of
battle
were
less
extended
and
the
more
rational
organization
of
armies
in
large
bodies
of
two
or
three
divisions
was
adopted
the
system
of
modern
strategy
was
here
fully
developed
and
the
campaigns
of
and
were
merely
corollaries
to
the
great
problem
solved
in
tactically
the
system
of
columns
and
skirmishers
was
too
well
adapted
to
the
features
of
italy
not
to
meet
with
his
approval
it
may
now
be
a
question
whether
the
system
of
napoleon
is
adapted
to
all
capacities
epochs
and
armies
or
whether
on
the
contrary
there
can
be
any
return
in
the
light
of
the
events
of
and
to
the
old
system
of
wars
of
position
after
a
comparison
of
the
marches
and
camps
of
the
seven
years
war
with
those
of
the
war
as
napoleon
called
the
campaign
of
or
with
those
of
the
three
months
which
elapsed
from
the
departure
of
the
army
from
boulogne
in
till
its
arrival
in
the
plains
of
moravia
the
reader
may
easily
decide
as
to
the
relative
merits
of
the
two
systems
the
system
of
napoleon
was
march
miles
a
day
to
fight
and
then
to
camp
in
he
told
me
that
he
knew
no
other
method
of
conducting
a
war
than
this
it
may
be
said
that
the
adventurous
character
of
this
great
man
his
personal
situation
and
the
tone
of
the
french
mind
all
concurred
in
urging
him
to
undertakings
which
no
other
person
whether
born
upon
a
throne
or
a
general
under
the
orders
of
his
government
would
ever
dare
to
adopt
this
is
probably
true
but
between
the
extremes
of
very
distant
invasions
and
wars
of
position
there
is
a
proper
mean
and
without
imitating
his
impetuous
audacity
we
may
pursue
the
line
he
has
marked
out
it
is
probable
that
the
old
system
of
wars
of
positions
will
for
a
long
time
be
proscribed
or
that
if
adopted
it
will
be
much
modified
and
improved
if
the
art
of
war
is
enlarged
by
the
adoption
of
the
system
of
marches
humanity
on
the
contrary
loses
by
it
for
these
rapid
incursions
and
bivouacs
of
considerable
masses
feeding
upon
the
regions
they
overrun
are
not
materially
different
from
the
devastations
of
the
barbarian
hordes
between
the
fourth
and
thirteenth
centuries
still
it
is
not
likely
that
the
system
will
be
speedily
renounced
for
a
great
truth
has
been
demonstrated
by
napoleon
wars
viz
that
remoteness
is
not
a
certain
safeguard
against
invasion
that
a
state
to
be
secure
must
have
a
good
system
of
fortresses
and
lines
of
defense
of
reserves
and
military
institutions
and
finally
a
good
system
of
government
then
the
people
may
everywhere
be
organized
as
militia
and
may
serve
as
reserves
to
the
active
armies
which
will
render
the
latter
more
formidable
and
the
greater
the
strength
of
the
armies
the
more
necessary
is
the
system
of
rapid
operations
and
prompt
results
if
in
time
social
order
assumes
a
calmer
state
if
nations
instead
of
fighting
for
their
existence
fight
only
for
their
interests
to
acquire
a
natural
frontier
or
to
maintain
the
political
equilibrium
then
a
new
right
of
nations
may
be
agreed
upon
and
perhaps
it
will
be
possible
to
have
armies
on
a
less
extensive
scale
then
also
we
may
see
armies
of
from
eighty
to
one
hundred
thousand
men
return
to
a
mixed
system
of
war
a
mean
between
the
rapid
incursions
of
napoleon
and
the
slow
system
of
positions
of
the
last
century
until
then
we
must
expect
to
retain
this
system
of
marches
which
has
produced
so
great
results
for
the
first
to
renounce
it
in
the
presence
of
an
active
and
capable
enemy
would
probably
be
a
victim
to
his
indiscretion
the
science
of
marches
now
includes
more
than
details
like
the
following
viz
the
order
of
the
different
arms
in
column
the
time
of
departure
and
arrival
the
precautions
to
be
observed
in
the
march
and
the
means
of
communication
between
the
columns
all
of
which
is
a
part
of
the
duties
of
the
staff
of
an
army
outside
and
beyond
these
very
important
details
there
is
a
science
of
marches
in
the
great
operations
of
strategy
for
instance
the
march
of
napoleon
by
the
to
fall
upon
the
communications
of
mélas
those
made
in
by
donauwerth
to
cut
off
mack
and
in
by
gera
to
turn
the
prussians
the
march
of
suwaroff
from
turin
to
the
trebbia
to
meet
macdonald
that
of
the
russian
army
on
taroutin
then
upon
krasnoi
were
decisive
operations
not
because
of
their
relation
to
logistics
but
on
account
of
their
strategic
relations
indeed
these
skillful
marches
are
but
applications
of
the
great
principle
of
throwing
the
mass
of
the
forces
upon
the
decisive
point
and
this
point
is
to
be
determined
from
the
considerations
given
in
article
xix
what
was
the
passage
of
the
but
a
line
of
operations
directed
against
an
extremity
of
the
strategic
front
of
the
enemy
and
thence
upon
his
line
of
retreat
the
marches
of
ulm
and
jena
were
the
same
maneuvers
and
what
was
blücher
march
at
waterloo
but
an
application
of
interior
strategic
lines
from
this
it
may
be
concluded
that
all
strategic
movements
which
tend
to
throw
the
mass
of
the
army
successively
upon
the
different
points
of
the
front
of
operations
of
the
enemy
will
be
skillful
as
they
apply
the
principle
of
overwhelming
a
smaller
force
by
a
superior
one
the
operations
of
the
french
in
from
dunkirk
to
landau
and
those
of
napoleon
in
and
are
models
of
this
kind
one
of
the
most
essential
points
in
the
science
of
modern
marches
is
to
so
combine
the
movements
of
the
columns
as
to
cover
the
greatest
strategic
front
when
beyond
the
reach
of
the
enemy
for
the
triple
object
of
deceiving
him
as
to
the
objective
in
view
of
moving
with
ease
and
rapidity
and
of
procuring
supplies
with
more
facility
however
it
is
necessary
in
this
case
to
have
previously
arranged
the
means
of
concentration
of
the
columns
in
order
to
inflict
a
decisive
blow
this
alternate
application
of
extended
and
concentric
movements
is
the
true
test
of
a
great
general
there
is
another
kind
of
marches
designated
as
which
deserves
notice
they
have
always
been
held
up
as
very
dangerous
but
nothing
satisfactory
has
ever
been
written
about
them
if
by
the
term
are
understood
tactical
maneuvers
made
upon
the
field
of
battle
in
view
of
the
enemy
it
is
certain
that
they
are
very
delicate
operations
though
sometimes
successful
but
if
reference
is
made
to
ordinary
strategic
marches
i
see
nothing
particularly
dangerous
in
them
unless
the
most
common
precautions
of
logistics
be
neglected
in
a
strategic
movement
the
two
hostile
armies
ought
to
be
separated
by
about
two
marches
counting
the
distance
which
separates
the
advanced
guards
from
the
enemy
and
from
their
own
columns
in
such
a
case
there
could
be
no
danger
in
a
strategic
march
from
one
point
to
another
there
are
however
two
cases
where
such
a
march
would
be
altogether
inadmissible
the
first
is
where
the
system
of
the
line
of
operations
of
the
strategic
lines
and
of
the
front
of
operations
is
so
chosen
as
to
present
the
flank
to
the
enemy
during
a
whole
operation
this
was
the
famous
project
of
marching
upon
leipsic
leaving
napoleon
and
dresden
on
the
flank
which
would
if
carried
out
have
proved
fatal
to
the
allies
it
was
modified
by
the
emperor
alexander
upon
the
solicitations
of
the
author
the
second
case
is
where
the
line
of
operations
is
very
long
as
was
the
case
with
napoleon
at
borodino
and
particularly
if
this
line
affords
but
a
single
suitable
route
for
retreat
then
every
flank
movement
exposing
this
line
would
be
a
great
fault
in
countries
abounding
in
secondary
communications
flank
movements
are
still
less
dangerous
since
if
repulsed
safety
may
be
found
in
a
change
of
the
line
of
operations
the
physical
and
moral
condition
of
the
troops
and
the
more
or
less
energetic
characters
of
the
commanders
will
of
course
be
elements
in
the
determination
of
such
movements
the
marches
of
jena
and
ulm
were
actual
flank
maneuvers
so
was
that
upon
milan
after
the
passage
of
the
chiusella
and
that
of
marshal
paskevitch
to
cross
the
vistula
at
ossiek
and
their
successful
issue
is
well
known
a
tactical
maneuver
by
the
flank
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
is
quite
a
different
affair
ney
suffered
for
a
movement
of
this
kind
at
dennewitz
and
so
did
marmont
at
salamanca
and
frederick
at
kolin
nevertheless
the
celebrated
maneuver
of
frederick
at
leuthen
was
a
true
flank
movement
but
it
was
covered
by
a
mass
of
cavalry
concealed
by
the
heights
and
applied
against
an
army
which
lay
motionless
in
its
camp
and
it
was
so
successful
because
at
the
time
of
the
decisive
shock
daun
was
taken
in
flank
and
not
frederick
in
the
old
system
of
marching
in
column
at
platoon
distance
where
line
of
battle
could
be
formed
to
the
right
or
left
without
deployment
by
a
right
or
left
into
line
movements
parallel
to
the
enemy
line
were
not
because
the
flank
of
the
column
was
the
real
front
of
the
line
of
battle
the
famous
march
of
eugene
within
view
of
the
french
army
to
turn
the
lines
of
turin
was
still
more
extraordinary
than
that
of
leuthen
and
no
less
successful
in
these
different
battles
the
maneuvers
were
tactical
and
not
strategic
the
march
of
eugene
from
mantua
to
turin
was
one
of
the
greatest
strategic
operations
of
the
age
but
the
case
above
referred
to
was
a
movement
made
to

article
xxv
depots
of
supplies
and
their
relation
to
marches
the
subject
most
nearly
connected
with
the
system
of
marches
is
the
commissariat
for
to
march
quickly
and
for
a
long
distance
food
must
be
supplied
and
the
problem
of
supporting
a
numerous
army
in
an
country
is
a
very
difficult
one
it
is
proposed
to
discuss
the
relation
between
the
commissariat
and
strategy
it
will
always
be
difficult
to
imagine
how
darius
and
xerxes
subsisted
their
immense
armies
in
thrace
where
now
it
would
be
a
hard
task
to
supply
thirty
thousand
men
during
the
middle
ages
the
greeks
barbarians
and
more
lately
the
crusaders
maintained
considerable
bodies
of
men
in
that
country
cæsar
said
that
war
should
support
war
and
he
is
generally
believed
to
have
lived
at
the
expense
of
the
countries
he
overran
the
middle
ages
were
remarkable
for
the
great
migrations
of
all
kinds
and
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
the
numbers
of
the
huns
vandals
goths
and
mongols
who
successively
traversed
europe
and
how
they
lived
during
their
marches
the
commissariat
arrangements
of
the
crusaders
would
also
be
an
interesting
subject
of
research
in
the
early
periods
of
modern
history
it
is
probable
that
the
armies
of
francis
in
crossing
the
alps
into
italy
did
not
carry
with
them
large
stores
of
provisions
for
armies
of
their
magnitude
of
forty
or
fifty
thousand
men
could
easily
find
provisions
in
the
rich
valleys
of
the
ticino
and
po
under
louis
xiv
and
frederick
ii
the
armies
were
larger
they
fought
on
their
own
frontiers
and
lived
from
their
storehouses
which
were
established
as
they
moved
this
interfered
greatly
with
operations
restricting
the
troops
within
a
distance
from
the
depots
dependent
upon
the
means
of
transportation
the
rations
they
could
carry
and
the
number
of
days
necessary
for
wagons
to
go
to
the
depots
and
return
to
camp
during
the
revolution
depots
of
supply
were
abandoned
from
necessity
the
large
armies
which
invaded
belgium
and
germany
lived
sometimes
in
the
houses
of
the
people
sometimes
by
requisitions
laid
upon
the
country
and
often
by
plunder
and
pillage
to
subsist
an
army
on
the
granaries
of
belgium
italy
swabia
and
the
rich
banks
of
the
rhine
and
danube
is
easy
particularly
if
it
marches
in
a
number
of
columns
and
does
not
exceed
one
hundred
or
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
but
this
would
be
very
difficult
in
some
other
countries
and
quite
impossible
in
russia
sweden
poland
and
turkey
it
may
readily
be
conceived
how
great
may
be
the
rapidity
and
impetuosity
of
an
army
where
every
thing
depends
only
on
the
strength
of
the
soldiers
legs
this
system
gave
napoleon
great
advantages
but
he
abused
it
by
applying
it
on
too
large
a
scale
and
to
countries
where
it
was
impracticable
a
general
should
be
capable
of
making
all
the
resources
of
the
invaded
country
contribute
to
the
success
of
his
enterprises
he
should
use
the
local
authorities
if
they
remain
to
regulate
the
assessments
so
as
to
make
them
uniform
and
legal
while
he
himself
should
see
to
their
fulfillment
if
the
authorities
do
not
remain
he
should
create
provisional
ones
of
the
leading
men
and
endow
them
with
extraordinary
powers
the
provisions
thus
acquired
should
be
collected
at
the
points
most
convenient
for
the
operations
of
the
army
in
order
to
husband
them
the
troops
may
be
quartered
in
the
towns
and
villages
taking
care
to
reimburse
the
inhabitants
for
the
extra
charge
thus
laid
upon
them
the
inhabitants
should
also
be
required
to
furnish
wagons
to
convey
the
supplies
to
the
points
occupied
by
the
troops
it
is
impossible
to
designate
precisely
what
it
will
be
prudent
to
undertake
without
having
previously
established
these
depots
as
much
depends
upon
the
season
country
strength
of
the
armies
and
spirit
of
the
people
but
the
following
may
be
considered
as
general
maxims
that
in
fertile
and
populous
regions
not
hostile
an
army
of
one
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
when
so
far
distant
from
the
enemy
as
to
be
able
safely
to
recover
a
considerable
extent
of
country
may
draw
its
resources
from
it
during
the
time
occupied
by
any
single
operation
as
the
first
operation
never
requires
more
than
a
month
during
which
time
the
great
body
of
the
troops
will
be
in
motion
it
will
be
sufficient
to
provide
by
depots
of
provisions
for
the
eventual
wants
of
the
army
and
particularly
for
those
of
the
troops
obliged
to
remain
at
a
particular
point
thus
the
army
of
napoleon
while
half
of
it
was
besieging
ulm
would
need
bread
until
the
surrender
of
the
city
and
if
there
had
been
a
scarcity
the
operation
might
have
failed
during
this
time
every
effort
should
be
made
to
collect
the
supplies
obtained
in
the
country
and
to
form
depots
in
order
to
subserve
the
wants
of
the
army
after
the
success
of
the
operation
whether
it
take
a
position
to
recruit
or
whether
it
undertake
a
new
enterprise
the
depots
formed
either
by
purchase
or
forced
requisitions
should
be
echeloned
as
much
as
possible
upon
three
different
lines
of
communication
in
order
to
supply
with
more
facility
the
wings
of
the
army
and
to
extend
as
much
as
possible
the
area
from
which
successive
supplies
are
to
be
drawn
and
lastly
in
order
that
the
depots
should
be
as
well
covered
as
possible
to
this
end
it
would
be
well
to
have
the
depots
on
lines
converging
toward
the
principal
line
of
operations
which
will
be
generally
found
in
the
center
this
arrangement
has
two
real
advantages
first
the
depots
are
less
exposed
to
the
attempts
of
the
enemy
as
his
distance
from
them
is
thereby
increased
secondly
it
facilitates
the
movements
of
the
army
in
concentrating
upon
a
single
point
of
the
line
of
operations
to
the
rear
with
a
view
of
retaking
the
initiative
from
the
enemy
who
may
have
temporarily
assumed
the
offensive
and
gained
some
advantage
in
and
unproductive
regions
the
army
will
lack
its
most
necessary
supplies
it
will
be
prudent
in
this
case
not
to
advance
too
far
from
its
depots
and
to
carry
with
it
sufficient
provisions
to
enable
it
if
compelled
to
do
so
to
fall
back
upon
its
lines
of
depots
in
national
wars
where
the
inhabitants
fly
and
destroy
every
thing
in
their
path
as
was
the
case
in
spain
portugal
russia
and
turkey
it
is
impossible
to
advance
unless
attended
by
trains
of
provisions
and
without
having
a
sure
base
of
supply
near
the
front
of
operations
under
these
circumstances
a
war
of
invasion
becomes
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
it
is
not
only
necessary
to
collect
large
quantities
of
supplies
but
it
is
indispensable
to
have
the
means
of
conveying
them
with
or
after
the
army
and
this
is
the
greatest
difficulty
particularly
on
rapid
expeditions
to
facilitate
their
transportation
the
rations
should
consist
of
the
most
portable
articles
as
biscuit
rice
the
wagons
should
be
both
light
and
strong
so
as
to
pass
over
all
kinds
of
roads
it
will
be
necessary
to
collect
all
the
vehicles
of
the
country
and
to
insure
good
treatment
to
their
owners
or
drivers
and
these
vehicles
should
be
arranged
in
parks
at
different
points
so
as
not
to
take
the
drivers
too
far
from
their
homes
and
in
order
to
husband
the
successive
resources
lastly
the
soldier
must
he
habituated
to
carry
with
him
several
days
rations
of
bread
rice
or
even
of
flour
the
vicinity
of
the
sea
is
invaluable
for
the
transportation
of
supplies
and
the
party
which
is
master
on
this
element
can
supply
himself
at
will
this
advantage
however
is
not
absolute
in
the
case
of
a
large
continental
army
for
in
the
desire
to
maintain
communications
with
its
depots
it
may
be
drawn
into
operations
on
the
coast
thus
exposing
itself
to
the
greatest
risks
if
the
enemy
maneuver
with
the
mass
of
his
forces
upon
the
extremity
opposite
the
sea
if
the
army
advance
too
far
from
the
coast
there
will
be
danger
of
its
communications
being
intercepted
and
this
danger
increases
with
the
progress
of
the
army
a
continental
army
using
the
sea
for
transportation
should
base
itself
on
the
land
and
have
a
reserve
of
provisions
independent
of
its
ships
and
a
line
of
retreat
prepared
on
the
extremity
of
its
strategic
front
opposed
to
the
sea
navigable
streams
and
canals
when
parallel
to
the
line
of
operations
of
the
army
render
the
transportation
of
supplies
much
easier
and
also
free
the
roads
from
the
incumbrances
of
the
numerous
vehicles
otherwise
necessary
for
this
reason
lines
of
operations
thus
situated
are
the
most
favorable
the
themselves
are
not
in
this
case
the
lines
of
operations
as
has
been
asserted
on
the
contrary
it
is
essential
that
the
troops
should
be
able
to
move
at
some
distance
from
the
river
in
order
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
throwing
back
the
exterior
flank
upon
the
river
which
might
be
as
dangerous
as
if
it
were
the
sea
in
the
enemy
country
the
rivers
can
scarcely
ever
be
used
for
transportation
since
the
boats
will
probably
be
destroyed
and
since
a
small
body
of
men
may
easily
embarrass
the
navigation
to
render
it
sure
it
is
necessary
to
occupy
both
banks
which
is
hazardous
as
mortier
experienced
at
dirnstein
in
a
friendly
country
the
advantages
of
rivers
are
more
substantial
in
default
of
bread
or
biscuit
the
pressing
wants
of
an
army
may
be
fed
by
cattle
on
the
hoof
and
these
can
generally
be
found
in
populous
countries
in
numbers
to
last
for
some
little
time
this
source
of
supply
will
however
be
soon
exhausted
and
in
addition
this
plan
leads
to
plunder
the
requisitions
for
cattle
should
be
well
regulated
and
the
best
plan
of
all
is
to
supply
the
army
with
cattle
purchased
elsewhere
i
will
end
this
article
by
recording
a
remark
of
napoleon
which
may
appear
whimsical
but
which
is
still
not
without
reason
he
said
that
in
his
first
campaigns
the
enemy
was
so
well
provided
that
when
his
troops
were
in
want
of
supplies
he
had
only
to
fall
upon
the
rear
of
the
enemy
to
procure
every
thing
in
abundance
this
is
a
remark
upon
which
it
would
be
absurd
to
found
a
system
but
which
perhaps
explains
the
success
of
many
a
rash
enterprise
and
proves
how
much
actual
war
differs
from
narrow
theory
article
xxvi
the
defense
of
frontiers
by
forts
and
intrenched
wars
of
sieges
forts
serve
two
principal
purposes
first
to
cover
the
frontiers
secondly
to
aid
the
operations
of
the
campaign
the
defense
of
frontiers
is
a
problem
generally
somewhat
indeterminate
it
is
not
so
for
those
countries
whose
borders
are
covered
with
great
natural
obstacles
and
which
present
but
few
accessible
points
and
these
admitting
of
defense
by
the
art
of
the
engineer
the
problem
here
is
simple
but
in
open
countries
it
is
more
difficult
the
alps
and
the
pyrenees
and
the
lesser
ranges
of
the
crapacks
of
riesengebirge
of
erzgebirge
of
the
böhmerwald
of
the
black
forest
of
the
vosges
and
of
the
jura
are
not
so
formidable
that
they
can
not
be
made
more
so
by
a
good
system
of
fortresses
of
all
these
frontiers
that
separating
france
and
piedmont
was
best
covered
the
valleys
of
the
stura
and
suza
the
passes
of
argentine
of
and
of
the
only
ones
considered
practicable
were
covered
by
masonry
forts
and
in
addition
works
of
considerable
magnitude
guarded
the
issues
of
the
valleys
in
the
plains
of
piedmont
it
was
certainly
no
easy
matter
to
surmount
these
difficulties
these
excellent
artificial
defenses
will
not
always
prevent
the
passage
of
an
army
because
the
small
works
which
are
found
in
the
gorges
may
be
carried
or
the
enemy
if
he
be
bold
may
find
a
passage
over
some
other
route
hitherto
deemed
impracticable
the
passage
of
the
alps
by
francis
which
is
so
well
described
by
gaillard
napoleon
passage
of
the
and
the
splugen
expedition
prove
that
there
is
truth
in
the
remark
of
napoleon
an
army
can
pass
wherever
a
titan
can
set
his
a
maxim
not
strictly
true
but
characteristic
of
the
man
and
applied
by
him
with
great
success
other
countries
are
covered
by
large
rivers
either
as
a
first
line
or
as
a
second
it
is
however
remarkable
that
such
lines
apparently
so
well
calculated
to
separate
nations
without
interfering
with
trade
and
communication
are
generally
not
part
of
the
real
frontier
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
danube
divides
bessarabia
from
the
ottoman
empire
as
long
as
the
turks
have
a
foothold
in
moldavia
the
rhine
was
never
the
real
frontier
of
france
and
germany
for
the
french
for
long
periods
held
points
upon
the
right
bank
while
the
germans
were
in
possession
of
mayence
luxembourg
and
the
de
of
manheim
and
wesel
on
the
left
bank
if
however
the
danube
the
rhine
rhone
elbe
oder
vistula
po
and
adige
be
not
exterior
lines
of
the
frontier
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
fortified
as
lines
of
permanent
defense
wherever
they
permit
the
use
of
a
system
suitable
for
covering
a
front
of
operations
an
example
of
this
kind
is
the
inn
which
separates
bavaria
from
austria
flanked
on
the
south
by
the
tyrolese
alps
on
the
north
by
bohemia
and
the
danube
its
narrow
front
is
covered
by
the
three
fortified
places
of
passau
braunau
and
salzburg
lloyd
with
some
poetic
license
compares
this
frontier
to
two
impregnable
bastions
whose
curtain
is
formed
of
three
fine
forts
and
whose
ditch
is
one
of
the
most
rapid
of
rivers
he
has
exaggerated
these
advantages
for
his
epithet
of
impregnable
was
decidedly
disproved
by
the
bloody
events
of
and
the
majority
of
the
european
states
have
frontiers
by
no
means
so
formidable
as
that
of
the
alps
and
the
inn
being
generally
open
or
consisting
of
mountains
with
practicable
passes
at
a
considerable
number
of
points
we
propose
to
give
a
set
of
general
maxims
equally
applicable
to
all
cases
when
the
topography
of
a
frontier
is
open
there
should
be
no
attempt
to
make
a
complete
line
of
defense
by
building
too
many
fortresses
requiring
armies
to
garrison
them
and
which
after
all
might
not
prevent
an
enemy
from
penetrating
the
country
it
is
much
wiser
to
build
fewer
works
and
to
have
them
properly
located
not
with
the
expectation
of
absolutely
preventing
the
ingress
of
the
enemy
but
to
multiply
the
impediments
to
his
progress
and
at
the
same
time
to
support
the
movements
of
the
army
which
is
to
repel
him
if
it
be
rare
that
a
fortified
place
of
itself
absolutely
prevents
the
progress
of
an
army
it
is
nevertheless
an
embarrassment
and
compels
the
army
to
detach
a
part
of
its
force
or
to
make
in
its
march
while
on
the
other
hand
it
imparts
corresponding
advantages
to
the
army
which
holds
it
covers
his
depots
flanks
and
movements
and
finally
is
a
place
of
refuge
in
case
of
need
fortresses
thus
exercise
a
manifest
influence
over
military
operations
and
we
now
propose
to
examine
their
relations
to
strategy
the
first
point
to
be
considered
is
their
location
the
second
lies
in
the
distinction
between
the
cases
where
an
army
can
afford
to
pass
the
forts
without
a
siege
and
those
where
it
will
be
necessary
to
besiege
the
third
point
is
in
reference
to
the
relations
of
an
army
to
a
siege
which
it
proposes
to
cover
as
fortresses
properly
located
favor
military
operations
in
the
same
degree
those
which
are
unfortunately
placed
are
disadvantageous
they
are
an
incubus
upon
the
army
which
is
compelled
to
garrison
them
and
the
state
whose
men
and
money
are
wasted
upon
them
there
are
many
in
europe
in
this
category
it
is
bad
policy
to
cover
a
frontier
with
fortresses
very
close
together
this
system
has
been
wrongly
imputed
to
vauban
who
on
the
contrary
had
a
controversy
with
louvois
about
the
great
number
of
points
the
latter
desired
to
fortify
the
maxims
on
this
point
are
as
follow
the
fortified
places
should
be
in
echelon
on
three
lines
and
should
extend
from
the
frontiers
toward
the
capital
there
should
be
three
in
the
first
line
as
many
in
the
second
and
a
large
place
in
the
third
near
the
center
of
the
state
if
there
be
four
fronts
this
would
require
for
a
complete
system
from
to
thirty
places
it
will
be
objected
that
this
number
is
large
and
that
even
austria
has
not
so
many
it
must
be
recollected
that
france
has
more
than
forty
upon
only
a
third
of
its
frontiers
from
besançon
to
dunkirk
and
still
has
not
enough
on
the
third
line
in
the
center
of
the
country
a
board
convened
for
the
purpose
of
considering
the
system
of
fortresses
has
decided
quite
recently
that
more
were
required
this
does
not
prove
that
there
were
not
already
too
many
but
that
certain
points
in
addition
should
be
fortified
while
those
on
the
first
line
although
too
much
crowded
may
be
maintained
since
they
are
already
in
existence
admitting
that
france
has
two
fronts
from
dunkirk
to
basel
one
from
basel
to
savoy
one
from
savoy
to
nice
in
addition
to
the
totally
distinct
line
of
the
pyrenees
and
the
there
are
six
fronts
requiring
forty
to
fifty
places
every
military
man
will
admit
that
this
is
enough
since
the
swiss
and
coast
fronts
require
fewer
than
the
northeast
the
system
of
arrangement
of
these
fortresses
is
an
important
element
of
their
usefulness
austria
has
a
less
number
because
she
is
bordered
by
the
small
german
states
which
instead
of
being
hostile
place
their
own
forts
at
her
disposal
moreover
the
number
above
given
is
what
was
considered
necessary
for
a
state
having
four
fronts
of
nearly
equal
development
prussia
being
long
and
narrow
and
extending
from
königsberg
almost
to
the
gates
of
metz
should
not
be
fortified
upon
the
same
system
as
france
spain
or
austria
thus
the
geographical
position
and
extent
of
states
may
either
diminish
or
increase
the
number
of
fortresses
particularly
when
maritime
forts
are
to
be
included
fortresses
should
always
occupy
the
important
strategic
points
already
designated
in
article
xix
as
to
their
tactical
qualities
their
sites
should
not
be
commanded
and
egress
from
them
should
be
easy
in
order
to
increase
the
difficulty
of
blockading
them
those
which
possess
the
greatest
advantages
either
as
to
their
own
defense
or
for
seconding
the
operations
of
an
army
are
certainly
those
situated
on
great
rivers
and
commanding
both
banks
mayence
coblentz
and
strasbourg
including
kehl
are
true
illustrations
and
models
of
this
kind
places
situated
at
the
confluence
of
two
great
rivers
command
three
different
fronts
and
hence
are
of
increased
importance
take
for
instance
modlin
mayence
when
it
had
on
the
left
bank
of
the
main
the
fort
of
gustavusburg
and
cassel
on
the
right
was
the
most
formidable
place
in
europe
but
it
required
a
garrison
of
thousand
men
so
that
works
of
this
extent
must
be
few
in
number
large
forts
when
encompassing
populous
and
commercial
cities
are
preferable
to
small
ones
particularly
when
the
assistance
of
the
citizens
can
be
relied
on
for
their
defense
metz
arrested
the
whole
power
of
charles
v
and
lille
for
a
whole
year
delayed
eugene
and
marlborough
strasbourg
has
many
times
proved
the
security
of
french
armies
during
the
last
wars
these
places
were
passed
without
being
besieged
by
the
invading
forces
because
all
europe
was
in
arms
against
france
but
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
germans
having
in
their
front
one
hundred
thousand
french
could
not
penetrate
to
the
seine
with
impunity
leaving
behind
them
these
points
formerly
the
operations
of
war
were
directed
against
towns
camps
and
positions
recently
they
have
been
directed
only
against
organized
armies
leaving
out
of
consideration
all
natural
or
artificial
obstacles
the
exclusive
use
of
either
of
these
systems
is
faulty
the
true
course
is
a
mean
between
these
extremes
doubtless
it
will
always
be
of
the
first
importance
to
destroy
and
disorganize
all
the
armies
of
the
enemy
in
the
field
and
to
attain
this
end
it
may
be
allowable
to
pass
the
fortresses
but
if
the
success
be
only
partial
it
will
be
unwise
to
push
the
invasion
too
far
here
also
very
much
depends
upon
the
situation
and
respective
strength
of
the
armies
and
the
spirit
of
the
nations
if
austria
were
the
sole
antagonist
of
france
she
could
not
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
the
allies
in
neither
is
it
probable
that
fifty
thousand
french
will
very
soon
risk
themselves
beyond
the
noric
alps
in
the
very
heart
of
austria
as
napoleon
did
in
such
events
only
occur
under
exceptional
circumstances
it
may
be
concluded
from
what
precedes
that
while
fortified
places
are
essential
supports
abuse
in
their
application
may
by
dividing
an
army
weaken
it
instead
of
adding
to
its
efficiency
that
an
army
may
with
the
view
of
destroying
the
enemy
pass
the
line
of
these
forts
always
however
leaving
a
force
to
observe
them
that
an
army
can
not
pass
a
large
river
like
the
danube
or
the
rhine
without
reducing
at
least
one
of
the
fortresses
on
the
river
in
order
to
secure
a
good
line
of
retreat
once
master
of
this
place
the
army
may
advance
on
the
offensive
leaving
detachments
to
besiege
other
places
and
the
chances
of
the
reduction
of
those
places
increase
as
the
army
advances
since
the
enemy
opportunities
of
hindering
the
siege
are
correspondingly
diminished
while
large
places
are
much
the
most
advantageous
among
a
friendly
people
smaller
works
are
not
without
importance
not
to
arrest
an
enemy
who
might
mask
them
but
as
they
may
materially
aid
the
operations
of
an
army
in
the
field
the
fort
of
königstein
in
was
as
useful
to
the
french
as
the
fortress
of
dresden
because
it
procured
a
de
on
the
elbe
in
a
mountainous
country
small
forts
are
equal
in
value
to
fortified
places
because
their
province
is
to
close
the
passes
and
not
to
afford
refuge
to
armies
the
little
fort
of
bard
in
the
valley
of
aosta
almost
arrested
napoleon
army
in
it
follows
that
each
frontier
should
have
one
or
two
large
fortresses
as
places
of
refuge
besides
secondary
forts
and
small
posts
to
facilitate
military
operations
walled
cities
with
a
shallow
ditch
may
be
very
useful
in
the
interior
of
a
country
to
contain
depots
hospitals
c
when
they
are
strong
enough
to
resist
the
attacks
of
any
small
bodies
that
may
traverse
the
vicinity
they
will
be
particularly
serviceable
if
they
can
be
defended
by
the
militia
so
as
not
to
weaken
the
active
army
large
fortified
places
which
are
not
in
proper
strategic
positions
are
a
positive
misfortune
for
both
the
army
and
state
those
on
the
are
of
importance
only
in
a
maritime
war
except
for
depots
they
may
even
prove
disastrous
for
a
continental
army
by
holding
out
to
it
a
delusive
promise
of
support
benningsen
almost
lost
the
russian
armies
by
basing
them
in
on
königsberg
which
he
did
because
it
was
convenient
for
supply
if
the
russian
army
in
instead
of
concentrating
on
smolensk
had
supported
itself
on
dunaburg
and
riga
it
would
have
been
in
danger
of
being
forced
into
the
sea
and
of
being
cut
off
from
all
its
bases
the
relations
between
sieges
and
the
operations
of
active
armies
are
of
two
kinds
an
invading
army
may
pass
by
fortified
places
without
attacking
them
but
it
must
leave
a
force
to
invest
them
or
at
least
to
watch
them
and
when
there
are
a
number
of
them
adjacent
to
each
other
it
will
be
necessary
to
leave
an
entire
corps
under
a
single
commander
to
invest
or
watch
them
as
circumstances
may
require
when
the
invading
army
decides
to
attack
a
place
a
sufficient
force
to
carry
on
the
siege
will
be
assigned
to
this
duty
the
remainder
may
either
continue
its
march
or
take
a
position
to
cover
the
siege
formerly
the
false
system
prevailed
of
encircling
a
city
by
a
whole
army
which
buried
itself
in
lines
of
circumvallation
and
contravallation
these
lines
cost
as
much
in
labor
and
expense
as
the
siege
itself
the
famous
case
of
the
lines
of
turin
which
were
fifteen
miles
in
length
and
though
guarded
by
thousand
french
were
forced
by
prince
eugene
with
forty
thousand
men
in
is
enough
to
condemn
this
ridiculous
system
much
as
the
recital
of
the
immense
labors
of
cæsar
in
the
investment
of
alise
may
excite
our
admiration
it
is
not
probable
that
any
general
in
our
times
will
imitate
his
example
nevertheless
it
is
very
necessary
for
the
investing
force
to
strengthen
its
position
by
detached
works
commanding
the
routes
by
which
the
garrison
might
issue
or
by
which
the
siege
might
be
disturbed
from
without
this
was
done
by
napoleon
at
mantua
and
by
the
russians
at
varna
experience
has
proved
that
the
best
way
to
cover
a
siege
is
to
beat
and
pursue
as
far
as
possible
the
enemy
forces
which
could
interfere
if
the
besieging
force
is
numerically
inferior
it
should
take
up
a
strategic
position
covering
all
the
avenues
by
which
succor
might
arrive
and
when
it
approaches
as
much
of
the
besieging
force
as
can
be
spared
should
unite
with
the
covering
force
to
fall
upon
the
approaching
army
and
decide
whether
the
siege
shall
continue
or
not
bonaparte
in
at
mantua
was
a
model
of
wisdom
and
skill
for
the
operations
of
an
army
of
observation
intrenched
lines
besides
the
lines
of
circumvallation
and
contravallation
referred
to
above
there
is
another
kind
which
is
more
extended
than
they
are
and
is
in
a
measure
allied
to
permanent
fortifications
because
it
is
intended
to
protect
a
part
of
the
frontiers
as
a
fortress
or
an
intrenched
camp
may
as
a
temporary
refuge
for
an
army
be
highly
advantageous
so
to
the
same
degree
is
the
system
of
intrenched
lines
absurd
i
do
not
now
refer
to
lines
of
small
extent
closing
a
narrow
gorge
like
fussen
and
scharnitz
for
they
may
be
regarded
as
forts
but
i
speak
of
extended
lines
many
leagues
in
length
and
intended
to
wholly
close
a
part
of
the
frontiers
for
instance
those
of
wissembourg
which
covered
by
the
lauter
flowing
in
front
supported
by
the
rhine
on
the
right
and
the
vosges
on
the
left
seemed
to
fulfill
all
the
conditions
of
safety
and
yet
they
were
forced
on
every
occasion
when
they
were
assailed
the
lines
of
stollhofen
which
on
the
right
of
the
rhine
played
the
same
part
as
those
of
wissembourg
on
the
left
were
equally
unfortunate
and
those
of
the
queich
and
the
kinzig
had
the
same
fate
the
lines
of
turin
and
those
of
mayence
although
intended
as
lines
of
circumvallation
were
analogous
to
the
lines
in
question
in
their
extent
and
in
the
fate
which
befell
them
however
well
they
may
be
supported
by
natural
obstacles
their
great
extent
paralyzes
their
defenders
and
they
are
almost
always
susceptible
of
being
turned
to
bury
an
army
in
intrenchments
where
it
may
be
outflanked
and
surrounded
or
forced
in
front
even
if
secure
from
a
flank
attack
is
manifest
folly
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
we
shall
never
see
another
instance
of
it
nevertheless
in
our
chapter
on
tactics
we
will
treat
of
their
attack
and
defense
it
may
be
well
to
remark
that
while
it
is
absurd
to
use
these
extended
lines
it
would
be
equally
foolish
to
neglect
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
detached
works
in
increasing
the
strength
of
a
besieging
force
the
safety
of
a
position
or
the
defense
of
a
defile

the
memorable
campaign

evidence
of
the
value

such
a
system
if

had
possessed

in
the

the
russians

simple
footnote
still
napoleon
was
right
in
taking
the
offensive
in
the
frioul
since
the
austrians
were
expecting
a
reinforcement
from
the
rhine
of
twenty
thousand
men
and
of
course
it
was
highly
important
to
beat
the
archduke
charles
before
this
force
joined
him
in

of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
napoleon
conduct
was
in

with
the
principles
of

the
connection
of
intrenched
camps
and
têtes
de
ponts
with
strategy
it
would
be
out
of
place
here
to
go
into
details
as
to
the
sites
of
ordinary
camps
and
upon
the
means
of
covering
them
by
advanced
guards
or
upon
the
advantages
of
in
the
defense
of
posts
only
fortified
camps
enter
into
the
combinations
of
grand
tactics
and
even
of
strategy
and
this
they
do
by
the
temporary
support
they
afford
an
army
it
may
be
seen
by
the
example
of
the
camp
of
buntzelwitz
which
saved
frederick
in
and
by
those
of
kehl
and
dusseldorf
in
that
such
a
refuge
may
prove
of
the
greatest
importance
the
camp
of
ulm
in
enabled
kray
to
arrest
for
a
whole
month
the
army
of
moreau
on
the
danube
and
wellington
derived
great
advantages
from
his
camp
of
the
turks
were
greatly
assisted
in
defending
the
country
between
the
danube
and
the
balkan
mountains
by
the
camp
of
shumla
the
principal
rule
in
this
connection
is
that
camps
should
be
established
on
strategic
points
which
should
also
possess
tactical
advantages
if
the
camp
of
drissa
was
useless
to
the
russians
in
it
was
because
it
was
not
in
a
proper
position
in
reference
to
their
defensive
system
which
should
have
rested
upon
smolensk
and
moscow
hence
the
russians
were
compelled
to
abandon
it
after
a
few
days
the
maxims
which
have
been
given
for
the
determination
of
the
great
decisive
strategic
points
will
apply
to
all
intrenched
camps
because
they
ought
only
to
be
placed
on
such
points
the
influence
of
these
camps
is
variable
they
may
answer
equally
well
as
points
of
departure
for
an
offensive
operation
as
de
to
assure
the
crossing
of
a
large
river
as
protection
for
winter
quarters
or
as
a
refuge
for
a
defeated
army
however
good
may
be
the
site
of
such
a
camp
it
will
always
be
difficult
to
locate
it
so
that
it
may
not
be
turned
unless
like
the
camp
of
it
be
upon
a
peninsula
backed
by
the
sea
whenever
it
can
be
passed
either
by
the
right
or
the
left
the
army
will
be
compelled
to
abandon
it
or
run
the
risk
of
being
invested
in
it
the
camp
of
dresden
was
an
important
support
to
napoleon
for
two
months
but
as
soon
as
it
was
outflanked
by
the
allies
it
had
not
the
advantages
even
of
an
ordinary
fortress
for
its
extent
led
to
the
sacrifice
of
two
corps
within
a
few
days
for
want
of
provisions
despite
all
this
these
camps
when
only
intended
to
afford
temporary
support
to
an
army
on
the
defensive
may
still
fulfill
this
end
even
when
the
enemy
passes
by
them
provided
they
can
not
be
taken
in
reverse
that
is
provided
all
their
faces
are
equally
safe
from
a
de
it
is
also
important
that
they
be
established
close
to
a
fortress
where
the
depots
may
be
safe
or
which
may
cover
the
front
of
the
camp
nearest
to
the
line
of
retreat
in
general
terms
such
a
camp
on
a
river
with
a
large
de
on
the
other
side
to
command
both
banks
and
near
a
large
fortified
city
like
mayence
or
strasbourg
is
of
undoubted
advantage
but
it
will
never
be
more
than
a
temporary
refuge
a
means
of
gaining
time
and
of
collecting
reinforcements
when
the
object
is
to
drive
away
the
enemy
it
will
be
necessary
to
leave
the
camp
and
carry
on
operations
in
the
open
country
the
second
maxim
as
to
these
camps
is
that
they
are
particularly
advantageous
to
an
army
at
home
or
near
its
base
of
operations
if
a
french
army
occupied
an
intrenched
camp
on
the
elbe
it
would
be
lost
when
the
space
between
the
rhine
and
elbe
was
held
by
the
enemy
but
if
it
were
invested
in
an
intrenched
camp
near
strasbourg
it
might
with
a
little
assistance
resume
its
superiority
and
take
the
field
while
the
enemy
in
the
interior
of
france
and
between
the
relieving
force
and
the
intrenched
army
would
have
great
difficulty
in
recrossing
the
rhine
we
have
heretofore
considered
these
camps
in
a
strategic
light
but
several
german
generals
have
maintained
that
they
are
suitable
to
cover
places
or
to
prevent
sieges
which
appears
to
me
to
be
a
little
sophistical
doubtless
it
will
be
more
difficult
to
besiege
a
place
when
an
army
is
encamped
on
its
glacis
and
it
maybe
said
that
the
forts
and
camps
are
a
mutual
support
but
according
to
my
view
the
real
and
principal
use
of
intrenched
camps
is
always
to
afford
if
necessary
a
temporary
refuge
for
an
army
or
the
means
of
debouching
offensively
upon
a
decisive
point
or
beyond
a
large
river
to
bury
an
army
in
such
a
camp
to
expose
it
to
the
danger
of
being
outflanked
and
cut
off
simply
to
retard
a
siege
would
be
folly
the
example
of
wurmser
who
prolonged
the
defense
of
mantua
will
be
cited
in
opposition
to
this
but
did
not
his
army
perish
and
was
this
sacrifice
really
useful
i
do
not
think
so
for
the
place
having
been
once
relieved
and
revictualed
and
the
having
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
austrians
the
siege
was
necessarily
changed
into
a
blockade
and
the
town
could
only
be
taken
by
reason
of
famine
and
this
being
the
case
wurmser
presence
ought
rather
to
have
hastened
than
retarded
its
surrender
the
intrenched
camp
of
the
austrians
before
mayence
in
would
indeed
have
prevented
the
siege
of
the
place
if
the
french
had
possessed
the
means
of
carrying
on
a
siege
as
long
as
the
rhine
had
not
been
crossed
but
as
soon
as
jourdan
appeared
on
the
lahn
and
moreau
in
the
black
forest
it
became
necessary
to
abandon
the
camp
and
leave
the
place
to
its
own
means
of
defense
it
would
only
be
in
the
event
of
a
fortress
occupying
a
point
such
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
an
army
to
pass
it
without
taking
it
that
an
intrenched
camp
with
the
object
of
preventing
an
attack
upon
it
would
be
established
and
what
place
in
europe
is
upon
such
a
site
so
far
from
agreeing
with
these
german
authors
on
the
contrary
it
seems
to
me
that
a
very
important
question
in
the
establishment
of
these
camps
near
fortified
places
on
a
river
is
whether
they
should
be
on
the
same
bank
as
the
place
or
upon
the
other
when
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
choice
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
place
can
not
be
located
to
cover
both
banks
i
should
decidedly
prefer
the
latter
to
serve
as
a
refuge
or
to
favor
a
debouch
the
camp
should
be
on
the
bank
of
the
river
toward
the
enemy
and
in
this
case
the
principal
danger
to
be
feared
is
that
the
enemy
might
take
the
camp
in
reverse
by
passing
the
river
at
some
other
point
and
if
the
fortress
were
upon
the
same
bank
us
the
camp
it
would
be
of
little
service
while
if
upon
the
other
bank
opposite
to
the
camp
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
take
the
latter
in
reverse
for
instance
the
russians
who
could
not
hold
for
hours
their
camp
of
drissa
would
have
defied
the
enemy
for
a
long
time
if
there
had
been
a
fortification
on
the
right
bank
of
the
dwina
covering
the
rear
of
the
camp
so
moreau
for
three
months
at
kehl
withstood
all
the
efforts
of
the
archduke
charles
while
if
strasbourg
had
not
been
there
upon
the
opposite
bank
his
camp
would
easily
have
been
turned
by
a
passage
of
the
rhine
indeed
it
would
be
desirable
to
have
the
protection
of
the
fortified
place
upon
the
other
bank
too
and
a
place
holding
both
banks
would
fulfill
this
condition
the
fortification
of
coblentz
recently
constructed
seems
to
introduce
a
new
epoch
this
system
of
the
prussians
combining
the
advantages
of
intrenched
camps
and
permanent
works
deserves
attentive
consideration
but
whatever
may
be
its
defects
it
is
nevertheless
certain
that
it
would
afford
immense
advantages
to
an
army
intended
to
operate
on
the
rhine
indeed
the
inconvenience
of
intrenched
camps
on
large
rivers
is
that
they
are
only
very
useful
when
beyond
the
river
and
in
this
case
they
are
exposed
to
the
dangers
arising
from
destruction
of
bridges
as
happened
to
napoleon
at
essling
to
say
nothing
of
the
danger
of
losing
their
provisions
and
munitions
or
even
of
a
front
attack
against
which
the
works
might
not
avail
the
system
of
detached
permanent
works
of
coblentz
has
the
advantage
of
avoiding
these
dangers
by
protecting
the
depots
on
the
same
bank
as
the
army
and
in
guaranteeing
to
the
army
freedom
from
attack
at
least
until
the
bridges
be
if
the
city
were
upon
the
right
bank
of
the
rhine
and
there
were
only
an
intrenched
camp
of
on
the
left
bank
there
would
be
no
certainty
of
security
either
for
the
depots
or
the
army
so
if
coblentz
were
a
good
ordinary
fortress
without
detached
forts
a
large
army
could
not
so
readily
make
it
a
place
of
refuge
nor
would
there
be
such
facilities
for
debouching
from
it
in
the
presence
of
an
enemy
the
fortress
of
ehrenbreitstein
which
is
intended
to
protect
coblentz
on
the
right
bank
is
so
difficult
of
access
that
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
blockade
it
and
the
egress
of
a
force
of
any
magnitude
might
be
vigorously
disputed
much
has
been
recently
said
of
a
new
system
used
by
the
archduke
maximilian
to
fortify
the
intrenched
camp
of
linz
by
masonry
towers
as
i
only
know
of
it
by
hearsay
and
the
description
by
captain
allard
in
the
i
can
not
discuss
it
thoroughly
i
only
know
that
the
system
of
towers
used
at
genoa
by
the
skillful
colonel
andreis
appeared
to
me
to
be
useful
but
still
susceptible
of
improvements
which
the
archduke
seems
to
have
added
we
are
told
that
the
towers
of
linz
situated
in
ditches
and
covered
by
the
glacis
have
the
advantage
of
giving
a
concentrated
horizontal
fire
and
of
being
sheltered
from
the
direct
shot
of
the
enemy
such
towers
if
well
flanked
and
connected
by
a
parapet
may
make
a
very
advantageous
camp
always
however
with
some
of
the
inconveniences
of
closed
lines
if
the
towers
are
isolated
and
the
intervals
carefully
covered
by
to
be
thrown
up
when
required
they
will
make
a
camp
preferable
to
one
covered
by
ordinary
redoubts
but
not
so
advantageous
as
afforded
by
the
large
detached
forts
of
coblentz
these
towers
number
eight
of
which
are
on
the
left
bank
with
a
square
fort
commanding
the
perlingsberg
of
these
on
the
right
bank
some
seven
or
eight
are
only
the
circumference
of
this
line
is
about
twelve
miles
the
towers
are
between
five
hundred
and
six
hundred
yards
apart
and
will
be
connected
in
case
of
war
by
a
palisaded
covered
way
they
are
of
masonry
of
three
tiers
of
guns
with
a
barbette
battery
which
is
the
principal
defense
mounting
eleven
pounders
two
howitzers
are
placed
in
the
upper
tier
those
towers
are
placed
in
a
wide
and
deep
ditch
the
of
which
forms
a
high
glacis
which
protects
the
tower
from
direct
shot
but
i
should
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
protect
the
artillery
from
direct
fire
some
say
that
this
has
cost
about
of
what
a
complete
bastioned
enceinte
necessary
to
make
linz
a
fortress
of
the
first
rank
would
have
cost
others
maintain
that
it
has
not
cost
more
than
a
quarter
as
much
as
a
bastioned
work
and
that
it
subserves
besides
an
entirely
different
object
if
these
works
are
to
resist
a
regular
siege
they
are
certainly
very
defective
but
regarded
as
an
intrenched
camp
to
give
refuge
and
an
outlet
upon
both
banks
of
the
danube
for
a
large
army
they
are
appropriate
and
would
be
of
great
importance
in
a
war
like
that
of
and
if
existing
then
would
probably
have
saved
the
capital
to
complete
a
grand
system
it
would
perhaps
have
been
better
to
encircle
linz
with
a
regular
bastioned
line
and
then
to
have
built
seven
or
eight
towers
between
the
eastern
salient
and
the
mouth
of
the
traun
within
a
direct
distance
of
about
two
and
a
half
miles
so
as
to
have
included
for
the
camp
only
the
curved
space
between
linz
the
traun
and
the
danube
then
the
double
advantage
of
a
fortress
of
the
first
rank
and
a
camp
under
its
guns
would
have
been
united
and
even
if
not
quite
so
large
would
have
answered
for
a
large
army
particularly
if
the
eight
towers
on
the
left
bank
and
the
fort
of
perlingsberg
had
been
preserved
têtes
de
ponts

are
the
most
important
of
all
the
difficulties
of
crossing
a
river
particularly
a
large
one
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
demonstrate
abundantly
the
immense
utility
of
such
works
which
can
be
less
easily
dispensed
with
than
intrenched
camps
since
if
the
bridges
are
safe
an
army
is
insured
from
the
disastrous
events
which
may
attend
a
rapid
retreat
across
a
large
river
de
are
doubly
advantageous
when
they
are
as
it
were
for
a
large
intrenched
camp
and
will
be
triply
so
if
they
also
cover
the
bank
opposite
to
the
location
of
the
camp
since
then
they
will
mutually
support
each
other
it
is
needless
to
state
that
these
works
are
particularly
important
in
an
enemy
country
and
upon
all
fronts
where
there
are
no
permanent
works
it
may
be
observed
that
the
principal
difference
between
the
system
of
intrenched
camps
and
that
of
de
is
that
the
best
intrenched
camps
are
composed
of
detached
and
closed
works
while
de
usually
consist
of
contiguous
works
not
closed
an
intrenched
line
to
admit
of
defense
must
be
occupied
in
force
throughout
its
whole
extent
which
would
generally
require
a
large
army
if
on
the
contrary
the
intrenchments
are
detached
closed
works
a
comparatively
small
force
can
defend
them

attack

defense
of
these
works

be
discussed

strategic
operations
in
mountains
a
mountainous
country
presents
itself
in
the
combinations
of
war
under
four
different
aspects
it
may
be
the
whole
theater
of
the
war
or
it
may
be
but
a
zone
it
may
be
mountainous
throughout
its
whole
extent
or
there
may
be
a
line
of
mountains
upon
emerging
from
which
the
army
may
debouch
into
large
and
rich
plains
if
switzerland
the
tyrol
the
noric
provinces
some
parts
of
turkey
and
hungary
catalonia
and
portugal
be
excepted
in
the
european
countries
the
mountains
are
in
single
ranges
in
these
cases
there
is
but
a
difficult
defile
to
cross
a
temporary
obstacle
which
once
overcome
is
an
advantage
rather
than
an
objection
in
fact
the
range
once
crossed
and
the
war
carried
into
the
plains
the
chain
of
mountains
may
be
regarded
as
an
eventual
base
upon
which
the
army
may
fall
back
and
find
a
temporary
refuge
the
only
essential
precaution
to
be
observed
is
not
to
allow
the
enemy
to
anticipate
the
army
on
this
line
of
retreat
the
part
of
the
alps
between
france
and
italy
and
the
pyrenees
which
are
not
so
high
though
equally
broad
are
of
this
nature
the
mountains
of
bohemia
and
of
the
black
forest
and
the
vosges
belong
to
this
class
in
catalonia
the
mountains
cover
the
whole
country
as
far
as
the
ebro
if
the
war
were
limited
to
this
province
the
combinations
would
not
be
the
same
as
if
there
were
but
a
line
of
mountains
hungary
in
this
respect
differs
little
from
lombardy
and
castile
for
if
the
crapacks
in
the
eastern
and
northern
part
are
as
marked
a
feature
as
the
pyrenees
they
are
still
but
a
temporary
obstacle
and
an
army
overcoming
it
whether
debouching
in
the
basin
of
the
waag
of
the
neytra
or
of
the
theiss
or
in
the
fields
of
mongatsch
would
have
the
vast
plains
between
the
danube
and
the
theiss
for
a
field
of
operations
the
only
difference
would
be
in
the
roads
which
in
the
alps
though
few
in
number
are
excellent
while
in
hungary
there
are
none
of
much
value
in
its
northern
part
this
chain
though
not
so
high
becomes
broader
and
would
seem
to
belong
to
that
class
of
fields
of
operations
which
are
wholly
mountainous
but
as
its
evacuation
may
be
compelled
by
decisive
operations
in
the
valleys
of
the
waag
or
the
theiss
it
must
be
regarded
as
a
temporary
barrier
the
attack
and
defense
of
this
country
however
would
be
a
strategic
study
of
the
most
interesting
character
when
an
extremely
mountainous
country
such
as
the
tyrol
or
switzerland
is
but
a
zone
of
operations
the
importance
of
these
mountains
is
secondary
and
they
must
be
observed
like
a
fortress
the
armies
deciding
the
great
contests
in
the
valleys
it
will
of
course
be
otherwise
if
this
be
the
whole
field
it
has
long
been
a
question
whether
possession
of
the
mountains
gave
control
of
the
valleys
or
whether
possession
of
the
valleys
gave
control
of
the
mountains
the
archduke
charles
a
very
intelligent
and
competent
judge
has
declared
for
the
latter
and
has
demonstrated
that
the
valley
of
the
danube
is
the
key
of
southern
germany
however
in
this
kind
of
questions
much
depends
upon
the
relative
forces
and
their
arrangement
in
the
country
if
sixty
thousand
french
were
advancing
on
bavaria
in
presence
of
an
equal
force
of
austrians
and
the
latter
should
throw
thirty
thousand
men
into
the
tyrol
intending
to
replace
them
by
reinforcements
on
its
arrival
on
the
inn
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
french
to
push
on
as
far
as
this
line
leaving
so
large
a
force
on
its
flanks
masters
of
the
outlets
of
scharnitz
fussen
kufstein
and
lofers
but
if
the
french
force
were
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
and
had
gained
such
successes
as
to
establish
its
superiority
over
the
army
in
its
front
then
it
might
leave
a
sufficient
detachment
to
mask
the
passes
of
the
tyrol
and
extend
its
progress
as
far
as
linz
as
moreau
did
in
thus
far
we
have
considered
these
mountainous
districts
as
only
accessory
zones
if
we
regard
them
as
the
principal
fields
of
operations
the
strategic
problem
seems
to
be
more
complicated
the
campaigns
of
and
are
equally
rich
in
instruction
on
this
branch
of
the
art
in
my
account
of
them
i
have
endeavored
to
bring
out
their
teachings
by
a
historical
exposition
of
the
events
and
i
can
not
do
better
than
refer
my
readers
to
it
when
we
consider
the
results
of
the
imprudent
invasion
of
switzerland
by
the
french
directory
and
its
fatal
influence
in
doubling
the
extent
of
the
theater
of
operations
and
making
it
reach
from
the
texel
to
naples
we
can
not
too
much
applaud
the
wisdom
of
france
and
austria
in
the
transactions
which
had
for
three
centuries
guaranteed
the
neutrality
of
switzerland
every
one
will
be
convinced
of
this
by
carefully
studying
the
interesting
campaigns
of
the
archduke
charles
suwaroff
and
massena
in
and
those
of
napoleon
and
moreau
in
the
first
is
a
model
for
operations
upon
an
entirely
mountainous
field
the
second
is
a
model
for
wars
in
which
the
fate
of
mountainous
countries
is
decided
on
the
plains
i
will
here
state
some
of
the
deductions
which
seem
to
follow
from
this
study
when
a
country
whose
whole
extent
is
mountainous
is
the
principal
theater
of
operations
the
strategic
combinations
can
not
be
entirely
based
upon
maxims
applicable
in
an
open
country
transversal
maneuvers
to
gain
the
extremity
of
the
front
of
operations
of
the
enemy
here
become
always
very
difficult
and
often
impossible
in
such
a
country
a
considerable
army
can
be
maneuvered
only
in
a
small
number
of
valleys
where
the
enemy
will
take
care
to
post
advanced
guards
of
sufficient
strength
to
delay
the
army
long
enough
to
provide
means
for
defeating
the
enterprise
and
as
the
ridges
which
separate
these
valleys
will
be
generally
crossed
only
by
paths
impracticable
for
the
passage
of
an
army
transversal
marches
can
only
be
made
by
small
bodies
of
light
troops
the
important
natural
strategic
points
will
be
at
the
junction
of
the
larger
valleys
or
of
the
streams
in
those
valleys
and
will
be
few
in
number
and
if
the
defensive
army
occupy
them
with
the
mass
of
its
forces
the
invader
will
generally
be
compelled
to
resort
to
direct
attacks
to
dislodge
it
however
if
great
strategic
maneuvers
in
these
cases
be
more
rare
and
difficult
it
by
no
means
follows
that
they
are
less
important
on
the
contrary
if
the
assailant
succeed
in
gaining
possession
of
one
of
these
centers
of
communication
between
the
large
valleys
upon
the
line
of
retreat
of
the
enemy
it
will
be
more
serious
for
the
latter
than
it
would
be
in
an
open
country
since
the
occupation
of
one
or
two
difficult
defiles
will
often
be
sufficient
to
cause
the
ruin
of
the
whole
army
if
the
attacking
party
have
difficulties
to
overcome
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
defense
has
quite
as
many
on
account
of
the
necessity
of
covering
all
the
outlets
by
which
an
attack
in
force
may
be
made
upon
the
decisive
points
and
of
the
difficulties
of
the
transversal
marches
which
it
would
be
compelled
to
make
to
cover
the
menaced
points
in
order
to
complete
what
i
have
said
upon
this
kind
of
marches
and
the
difficulties
of
directing
them
i
will
refer
to
what
napoleon
did
in
to
cut
off
mack
from
ulm
if
this
operation
was
facilitated
by
the
hundred
roads
which
cross
swabia
in
all
directions
and
if
it
would
have
been
impracticable
in
a
mountainous
country
for
want
of
transversal
routes
to
make
the
long
circuit
from
donauwerth
by
augsburg
to
memmingen
it
is
also
true
that
mack
could
by
these
same
hundred
roads
have
effected
his
retreat
with
much
greater
facility
than
if
he
had
been
entrapped
in
one
of
the
valleys
of
switzerland
or
of
the
tyrol
from
which
there
was
but
a
single
outlet
on
the
other
hand
the
general
on
the
defensive
may
in
a
level
country
concentrate
a
large
part
of
his
forces
for
if
the
enemy
scatter
to
occupy
all
the
roads
by
which
the
defensive
army
may
retire
it
will
be
easy
for
the
latter
to
crush
these
isolated
bodies
but
in
a
very
mountainous
country
where
there
are
ordinarily
but
one
or
two
principal
routes
into
which
other
valleys
open
even
from
the
direction
of
the
enemy
the
concentration
of
forces
becomes
more
difficult
since
serious
inconveniences
may
result
if
even
one
of
these
important
valleys
be
not
observed
nothing
can
better
demonstrate
the
difficulty
of
strategic
defense
in
mountainous
regions
than
the
perplexity
in
which
we
are
involved
when
we
attempt
simply
to
give
advice
in
such
cases
to
say
nothing
of
laying
down
maxims
for
them
if
it
were
but
a
question
of
the
defense
of
a
single
definite
front
of
small
extent
consisting
of
four
or
five
converging
valleys
the
common
junction
of
which
is
at
a
distance
of
two
or
three
short
marches
from
the
summits
of
the
ranges
it
would
be
easier
of
solution
it
would
then
be
sufficient
to
recommend
the
construction
of
a
good
fort
at
the
narrowest
and
turned
point
of
each
of
these
valleys
protected
by
these
forts
a
few
brigades
of
infantry
should
be
stationed
to
dispute
the
passage
while
half
the
army
should
be
held
in
reserve
at
the
junction
where
it
would
be
in
position
either
to
sustain
the
advanced
guards
most
seriously
threatened
or
to
fall
upon
the
assailant
with
the
whole
force
when
he
debouches
if
to
this
be
added
good
instructions
to
the
commanders
of
the
advanced
guards
whether
in
assigning
them
the
best
point
for
rendezvous
when
their
line
of
forts
is
pierced
or
in
directing
them
to
continue
to
act
in
the
mountains
upon
the
flank
of
the
enemy
the
general
on
the
defensive
may
regard
himself
as
invincible
thanks
to
the
many
difficulties
which
the
country
offers
to
the
assailant
but
if
there
be
other
fronts
like
this
upon
the
right
and
left
all
of
which
are
to
be
defended
the
problem
is
changed
the
difficulties
of
the
defense
increase
with
the
extent
of
the
fronts
and
this
system
of
a
cordon
of
forts
becomes
dangerous
while
it
is
not
easy
to
adopt
a
better
one
we
can
not
be
better
convinced
of
these
truths
than
by
the
consideration
of
the
position
of
massena
in
switzerland
in
after
defeat
at
stockach
he
occupied
the
line
from
basel
by
schaffhausen
and
rheineck
to
and
thence
by
la
furca
to
he
had
enemies
in
front
of
basel
at
waldshut
at
schaffhausen
at
feldkirch
and
at
chur
bellegarde
threatened
the
and
the
italian
army
menaced
the
simplon
and
the
how
was
he
to
defend
such
a
circumference
and
how
could
he
leave
open
one
of
these
great
valleys
thus
risking
every
thing
from
rheinfelden
to
the
jura
toward
soleure
it
was
but
two
short
marches
and
there
was
the
mouth
of
the
trap
in
which
the
french
army
was
placed
this
was
then
the
pivot
of
the
defense
but
how
could
he
leave
schaffhausen
unprotected
how
abandon
rheineck
and
the
how
open
the
valais
and
the
approach
by
berne
without
surrendering
the
whole
of
switzerland
to
the
coalition
and
if
he
covered
each
point
even
by
a
brigade
where
would
be
his
army
when
he
would
need
it
to
give
battle
to
an
approaching
force
it
is
a
natural
system
on
a
level
theater
to
concentrate
the
masses
of
an
army
but
in
the
mountains
such
a
course
would
surrender
the
keys
of
the
country
and
besides
it
is
not
easy
to
say
where
an
inferior
army
could
be
concentrated
without
compromising
it
after
the
forced
evacuation
of
the
line
of
the
rhine
and
zurich
it
seemed
that
the
only
strategic
point
for
massena
to
defend
was
the
line
of
the
jura
he
was
rash
enough
to
stand
upon
the
albis
a
line
shorter
than
that
of
the
rhine
it
is
true
but
exposed
for
an
immense
distance
to
the
attacks
of
the
austrians
if
bellegarde
instead
of
going
into
lombardy
by
the
valtellina
had
marched
to
berne
or
made
a
junction
with
the
archduke
massena
would
have
been
ruined
these
events
seem
to
prove
that
if
a
country
covered
with
high
mountains
be
favorable
for
defense
in
a
tactical
point
of
view
it
is
different
in
a
strategic
sense
because
it
necessitates
a
division
of
the
troops
this
can
only
be
remedied
by
giving
them
greater
mobility
and
by
passing
often
to
the
offensive
general
clausewitz
whose
logic
is
frequently
defective
maintains
on
the
contrary
that
movements
being
the
most
difficult
part
in
this
kind
of
war
the
defensive
party
should
avoid
them
since
by
such
a
course
he
might
lose
the
advantages
of
the
local
defenses
he
however
ends
by
demonstrating
that
a
passive
defense
must
yield
under
an
active
attack
which
goes
to
show
that
the
initiative
is
no
less
favorable
in
mountains
than
in
plains
if
there
could
be
any
doubt
on
this
point
it
ought
to
be
dispelled
by
massena
campaign
in
switzerland
where
he
sustained
himself
only
by
attacking
the
enemy
at
every
opportunity
even
when
he
was
obliged
to
seek
him
on
the
grimsel
and
the
napoleon
course
was
similar
in
in
the
tyrol
when
he
was
opposed
to
wurmser
and
alvinzi
as
for
detailed
strategic
maneuvers
they
may
be
comprehended
by
reading
the
events
of
suwaroff
expedition
by
the
upon
the
muttenthal
while
we
must
approve
his
maneuvers
in
endeavoring
to
capture
lecourbe
in
the
valley
of
the
reuss
we
must
also
admire
the
presence
of
mind
activity
and
unyielding
firmness
which
saved
that
general
and
his
division
afterward
in
the
schachenthal
and
the
muttenthal
suwaroff
was
placed
in
the
same
position
as
lecourbe
had
been
and
extricated
himself
with
equal
ability
not
less
extraordinary
was
the
ten
days
campaign
of
general
molitor
who
with
four
thousand
men
was
surrounded
in
the
canton
of
glaris
by
more
than
thirty
thousand
allies
and
yet
succeeded
in
maintaining
himself
behind
the
linth
after
four
admirable
fights
these
events
teach
us
the
vanity
of
all
theory
and
also
that
in
such
a
country
a
strong
and
heroic
will
is
worth
more
than
all
the
precepts
in
the
world
after
such
lessons
need
i
say
that
one
of
the
principal
rules
of
this
kind
of
war
is
not
to
risk
one
self
in
the
valleys
without
securing
the
heights
shall
i
say
also
that
in
this
kind
of
war
more
than
in
any
other
operations
should
be
directed
upon
the
communications
of
the
enemy
and
finally
that
good
temporary
bases
or
lines
of
defense
at
the
confluence
of
the
great
valleys
covered
by
strategic
reserves
combined
with
great
mobility
and
frequent
offensive
movements
will
be
the
best
means
of
defending
the
country
i
can
not
terminate
this
article
without
remarking
that
mountainous
countries
are
particularly
favorable
for
defense
when
the
war
is
a
national
one
in
which
the
whole
people
rise
up
to
defend
their
homes
with
the
obstinacy
which
enthusiasm
for
a
holy
cause
imparts
every
advance
is
then
dearly
bought
but
to
be
successful
it
is
always
necessary
that
the
people
be
sustained
by
a
disciplined
force
more
or
less
numerous
without
this
they
must
finally
yield
like
the
heroes
of
stanz
and
of
the
tyrol
the
offensive
against
a
mountainous
country
also
presents
a
double
case
it
may
either
be
directed
upon
a
belt
of
mountains
beyond
which
are
extensive
plains
or
the
whole
theater
may
be
mountainous
in
the
first
case
there
is
little
more
to
be
done
than
this
viz
make
demonstrations
upon
the
whole
line
of
the
frontier
in
order
to
lead
the
enemy
to
extend
his
defense
and
then
force
a
passage
at
the
point
which
promises
the
greatest
results
the
problem
in
such
a
case
is
to
break
through
a
cordon
which
is
strong
less
on
account
of
the
numbers
of
the
defenders
than
from
their
position
and
if
broken
at
one
point
the
whole
line
is
forced
the
history
of
bard
in
and
the
capture
of
leutasch
and
scharnitz
in
by
ney
who
threw
fourteen
thousand
men
on
innspruck
in
the
midst
of
thirty
thousand
austrians
and
by
seizing
this
central
point
compelled
them
to
retreat
in
all
directions
show
that
with
brave
infantry
and
bold
commanders
these
famous
can
generally
be
forced
the
history
of
the
passage
of
the
alps
where
francis
turned
the
army
which
was
awaiting
him
at
suza
by
passing
the
steep
mountains
between
and
the
valley
of
queyras
is
an
example
of
those
obstacles
which
can
always
be
surmounted
to
oppose
him
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
adopt
a
system
of
cordon
and
we
have
already
seen
what
is
to
be
expected
of
it
the
position
of
the
swiss
and
italians
at
suza
was
even
less
wise
than
the
because
it
inclosed
them
in
a
contracted
valley
without
protecting
the
lateral
issues
their
strategic
plan
ought
to
have
been
to
throw
troops
into
these
valleys
to
defend
the
defiles
and
to
post
the
bulk
of
the
army
toward
turin
or
carignano
when
we
consider
the
difficulties
of
this
kind
of
war
and
the
immense
advantages
it
affords
the
defense
we
may
be
inclined
to
regard
the
concentration
of
a
considerable
force
to
penetrate
by
a
single
valley
as
an
extremely
rash
maneuver
and
to
think
that
it
ought
to
be
divided
into
as
many
columns
as
there
are
practicable
passes
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
of
all
illusions
and
to
confirm
what
i
say
it
is
only
necessary
to
refer
to
the
fate
of
the
columns
of
championnet
at
the
battle
of
fossano
if
there
be
five
or
six
roads
on
the
menaced
front
they
should
all
of
course
be
threatened
but
the
army
should
cross
the
chain
in
not
more
than
two
masses
and
the
routes
which
these
follow
should
not
be
divergent
for
if
they
were
the
enemy
might
be
able
to
defeat
them

to

and

the

are
those
which
are

or
hostile
the
third
are
of
the
same
nature
but
made
partly
on
land
partly
by
sea
by
means
of
numerous
fleets
the
fourth
class
comprises
those
beyond
the
seas
to
found
defend
or
attack
distant
colonies
the
fifth
includes
the
great
descents
where
the
distance
passed
over
is
not
very
great
but
where
a
powerful
state
is
attacked
as
to
the
first
in
a
strategic
point
of
view
a
russian
army
on
the
rhine
or
in
italy
in
alliance
with
the
german
states
would
certainly
be
stronger
and
more
favorably
situated
than
if
it
had
reached
either
of
these
points
by
passing
over
hostile
or
even
neutral
territory
for
its
base
lines
of
operations
and
eventual
points
of
support
will
be
the
same
as
those
of
its
allies
it
may
find
refuge
behind
their
lines
of
defense
provisions
in
their
depots
and
munitions
in
their
arsenals
while
in
the
other
case
its
resources
would
be
upon
the
vistula
or
the
niemen
and
it
might
afford
another
example
of
the
sad
fate
of
many
of
these
great
invasions
in
spite
of
the
important
difference
between
a
war
in
which
a
state
is
merely
an
auxiliary
and
a
distant
invasion
undertaken
for
its
own
interest
and
with
its
own
resources
there
are
nevertheless
dangers
in
the
way
of
these
auxiliary
armies
and
perplexity
for
the
commander
of
all
the
armies
particularly
if
he
belong
to
the
state
which
is
not
a
principal
party
as
may
be
learned
from
the
campaign
of
general
koutousoff
advanced
on
the
inn
to
the
boundaries
of
bavaria
with
thirty
thousand
russians
to
effect
a
junction
with
mack
whose
army
in
the
mean
time
had
been
destroyed
with
the
exception
of
eighteen
thousand
men
brought
back
from
donauwerth
by
kienmayer
the
russian
general
thus
found
himself
with
fifty
thousand
men
exposed
to
the
impetuous
activity
of
napoleon
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
and
to
complete
his
misfortune
he
was
separated
from
his
own
frontiers
by
a
distance
of
about
seven
hundred
and
fifty
miles
his
position
would
have
been
hopeless
if
fifty
thousand
men
had
not
arrived
to
reinforce
him
the
battle
of
austerlitz
due
to
a
fault
of
weyrother
endangered
the
russian
army
anew
since
it
was
so
far
from
its
base
it
almost
became
the
victim
of
a
distant
alliance
and
it
was
only
peace
that
gave
it
the
opportunity
of
regaining
its
own
country
the
fate
of
suwaroff
after
the
victory
of
novi
especially
in
the
expedition
to
switzerland
and
that
of
hermann
corps
at
bergen
in
holland
are
examples
which
should
be
well
studied
by
every
commander
under
such
circumstances
general
benningsen
position
in
was
less
disadvantageous
because
being
between
the
vistula
and
the
niemen
his
communications
with
his
base
were
preserved
and
his
operations
were
in
no
respect
dependent
upon
his
allies
we
may
also
refer
to
the
fate
of
the
french
in
bohemia
and
bavaria
in
when
frederick
the
great
abandoned
them
and
made
a
separate
peace
in
this
case
the
parties
were
allies
rather
than
auxiliaries
but
in
the
latter
relation
the
political
ties
are
never
woven
so
closely
as
to
remove
all
points
of
dissension
which
may
compromise
military
operations
examples
of
this
kind
have
been
cited
in
article
on
political
objective
points
history
alone
furnishes
us
instruction
in
reference
to
distant
invasions
across
extensive
territories
when
half
of
europe
was
covered
with
forests
pasturages
and
flocks
and
when
only
horses
and
iron
were
necessary
to
transplant
whole
nations
from
one
end
of
the
continent
to
the
other
the
goths
huns
vandals
normans
arabs
and
tartars
overran
empires
in
succession
but
since
the
invention
of
powder
and
artillery
and
the
organization
of
formidable
standing
armies
and
particularly
since
civilization
and
statesmanship
have
brought
nations
closer
together
and
have
taught
them
the
necessity
of
reciprocally
sustaining
each
other
no
such
events
have
taken
place
besides
these
migrations
of
nations
there
were
other
expeditions
in
the
middle
ages
which
were
of
a
more
military
character
as
those
of
charlemagne
and
others
since
the
invention
of
powder
there
have
been
scarcely
any
except
the
advance
of
charles
viii
to
naples
and
of
charles
xii
into
the
ukraine
which
can
be
called
distant
invasions
for
the
campaigns
of
the
spaniards
in
flanders
and
of
the
swedes
in
germany
were
of
a
particular
kind
the
first
was
a
civil
war
and
the
swedes
were
only
auxiliaries
to
the
protestants
of
germany
and
besides
the
forces
concerned
in
both
were
not
large
in
modern
times
no
one
but
napoleon
has
dared
to
transport
the
armies
of
half
of
europe
from
the
rhine
to
the
volga
and
there
is
little
danger
that
he
will
be
imitated
apart
from
the
modifications
which
result
from
great
distances
all
invasions
after
the
armies
arrive
upon
the
actual
theater
present
the
same
operations
as
all
other
wars
as
the
chief
difficulty
arises
from
these
great
distances
we
should
recall
our
maxims
on
deep
lines
of
operations
strategic
reserves
and
eventual
bases
as
the
only
ones
applicable
and
here
it
is
that
their
application
is
indispensable
although
even
that
will
not
avert
all
danger
the
campaign
of
although
so
ruinous
to
napoleon
was
a
model
for
a
distant
invasion
his
care
in
leaving
prince
schwarzenberg
and
reynier
on
the
bug
while
macdonald
oudinot
and
wrede
guarded
the
dwina
victor
covered
smolensk
and
augereau
was
between
the
oder
and
vistula
proves
that
he
had
neglected
no
humanly
possible
precaution
in
order
to
base
himself
safely
but
it
also
proves
that
the
greatest
enterprises
may
fail
simply
on
account
of
the
magnitude
of
the
preparations
for
their
success
if
napoleon
erred
in
this
contest
it
was
in
neglecting
diplomatic
precautions
in
not
uniting
under
one
commander
the
different
bodies
of
troops
on
the
dwina
and
dnieper
in
remaining
ten
days
too
long
at
wilna
in
giving
the
command
of
his
right
to
his
brother
who
was
unequal
to
it
and
in
confiding
to
prince
schwarzenberg
a
duty
which
that
general
could
not
perform
with
the
devotedness
of
a
frenchman
i
do
not
speak
now
of
his
error
in
remaining
in
moscow
after
the
conflagration
since
then
there
was
no
remedy
for
the
misfortune
although
it
would
not
have
been
so
great
if
the
retreat
had
taken
place
immediately
he
has
also
been
accused
of
having
too
much
despised
distances
difficulties
and
men
in
pushing
on
as
far
as
the
kremlin
before
passing
judgment
upon
him
in
this
matter
however
we
ought
to
know
the
real
motives
which
induced
him
to
pass
smolensk
instead
of
wintering
there
as
he
had
intended
and
whether
it
would
have
been
possible
for
him
to
remain
between
that
city
and
vitebsk
without
having
previously
defeated
the
russian
army
it
is
doubtless
true
that
napoleon
neglected
too
much
the
resentment
of
austria
prussia
and
sweden
and
counted
too
surely
upon
a
between
wilna
and
the
dwina
although
he
fully
appreciated
the
bravery
of
the
russian
armies
he
did
not
realize
the
spirit
and
energy
of
the
people
finally
and
chiefly
instead
of
procuring
the
hearty
and
sincere
concurrence
of
a
military
state
whose
territories
would
have
given
him
a
sure
base
for
his
attack
upon
the
colossal
power
of
russia
he
founded
his
enterprise
upon
the
of
a
brave
and
enthusiastic
but
fickle
people
and
besides
he
neglected
to
turn
to
the
greatest
advantage
this
ephemeral
enthusiasm
the
fate
of
all
such
enterprises
makes
it
evident
that
the
capital
point
for
their
success
and
in
fact
the
only
maxim
to
be
given
is
never
to
attempt
them
without
having
secured
the
hearty
and
constant
alliance
of
a
respectable
power
near
enough
the
field
of
operations
to
afford
a
proper
base
where
supplies
of
every
kind
may
be
accumulated
and
which
may
also
in
case
of
reverse
serve
as
a
refuge
and
afford
new
means
of
resuming
the
offensive
as
to
the
precautions
to
be
observed
in
these
operations
the
reader
is
referred
to
articles
xxi
and
on
the
safety
of
deep
lines
of
operations
and
the
establishment
of
eventual
bases
as
giving
all
the
military
means
of
lessening
the
danger
to
these
should
be
added
a
just
appreciation
of
distances
obstacles
seasons
and
countries
in
short
accuracy
in
calculation
and
moderation
in
success
in
order
that
the
enterprise
may
not
be
carried
too
far
we
are
far
from
thinking
that
any
purely
military
maxims
can
insure
the
success
of
remote
invasions
in
four
thousand
years
only
five
or
six
have
been
successful
and
in
a
hundred
instances
they
have
nearly
ruined
nations
and
armies
expeditions
of
the
third
class
partly
on
land
partly
by
sea
have
been
rare
since
the
invention
of
artillery
the
crusades
being
the
last
in
date
of
occurrence
and
probably
the
cause
is
that
the
control
of
the
sea
after
having
been
held
in
succession
by
several
secondary
powers
has
passed
into
the
hands
of
england
an
insular
power
rich
in
ships
but
without
the
necessary
for
such
expeditions
it
is
evident
that
from
both
of
these
causes
the
condition
of
things
now
is
very
different
from
that
existing
when
xerxes
marched
to
the
conquest
of
greece
followed
by
four
thousand
vessels
of
all
dimensions
or
when
alexander
marched
from
macedonia
over
asia
minor
to
tyre
while
his
fleet
coasted
the
shore
nevertheless
if
we
no
longer
see
such
invasions
it
is
very
true
that
the
assistance
of
a
fleet
of
and
transports
will
always
be
of
immense
value
to
any
army
on
shore
when
the
two
can
act
in
concert
still
are
an
uncertain
resource
for
their
progress
depends
upon
the
winds
which
may
be
unfavorable
in
addition
any
kind
of
fleet
is
exposed
to
great
dangers
in
storms
which
are
not
of
rare
occurrence
the
more
or
less
hostile
tone
of
the
people
the
length
of
the
line
of
operations
and
the
great
distance
of
the
principal
objective
point
are
the
only
points
which
require
any
deviation
from
the
ordinary
operations
of
war
invasions
of
neighboring
states
if
less
dangerous
than
distant
ones
are
still
not
without
great
danger
of
failure
a
french
army
attacking
cadiz
might
find
a
tomb
on
the
guadalquivir
although
well
based
upon
the
pyrenees
and
possessing
intermediate
bases
upon
the
ebro
and
the
tagus
likewise
the
army
which
in
besieged
komorn
in
the
heart
of
hungary
might
have
been
destroyed
on
the
plains
of
wagram
without
going
as
far
as
the
beresina
the
antecedents
the
number
of
disposable
troops
the
successes
already
gained
the
state
of
the
country
will
all
be
elements
in
determining
the
extent
of
the
enterprises
to
be
undertaken
and
to
be
able
to
proportion
them
well
to
his
resources
in
view
of
the
attendant
circumstances
is
a
great
talent
in
a
general
although
diplomacy
does
not
play
so
important
a
part
in
these
invasions
as
in
those
more
distant
it
is
still
of
importance
since
as
stated
in
article
there
is
no
enemy
however
insignificant
whom
it
would
not
be
useful
to
convert
into
an
ally
the
influence
which
the
change
of
policy
of
the
duke
of
savoy
in
exercised
over
the
events
of
that
day
and
the
effects
of
the
stand
taken
by
maurice
of
saxony
in
and
of
bavaria
in
prove
clearly
the
importance
of
securing
the
strict
neutrality
of
all
states
adjoining
the
theater
of
war
when
their
can
not
be
obtained
epitome
of
strategy
the
task
which
i
undertook
seems
to
me
to
have
been
passably
fulfilled
by
what
has
been
stated
in
reference
to
the
strategic
combinations
which
enter
ordinarily
into
a
plan
of
campaign
we
have
seen
from
the
definition
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
that
in
the
most
important
operations
in
war
fixes
the
direction
of
movements
and
that
we
depend
upon
for
their
execution
therefore
before
treating
of
these
mixed
operations
it
will
be
well
to
give
here
the
combinations
of
grand
tactics
and
of
battles
as
well
as
the
maxims
by
the
aid
of
which
the
application
of
the
fundamental
principle
of
war
may
be
made
by
this
method
these
operations
half
strategic
and
half
tactical
will
be
better
comprehended
as
a
whole
but
in
the
first
place
i
will
give
a
synopsis
of
the
contents
of
the
preceding
chapter
from
the
different
articles
which
compose
it
we
may
conclude
that
the
manner
of
applying
the
general
principle
of
war
to
all
possible
theaters
of
operations
is
found
in
what
follows
in
knowing
how
to
make
the
best
use
of
the
advantages
which
the
reciprocal
directions
of
the
two
bases
of
operations
may
afford
in
accordance
with
article
xviii
in
choosing
from
the
three
zones
ordinarily
found
in
the
strategic
field
that
one
upon
which
the
greatest
injury
can
be
done
to
the
enemy
with
the
least
risk
to
one
self
in
establishing
well
and
giving
a
good
direction
to
the
lines
of
operations
adopting
for
defense
the
concentric
system
of
the
archduke
charles
in
and
of
napoleon
in
or
that
of
soult
in
for
retreats
parallel
to
the
frontiers
on
the
offensive
we
should
follow
the
system
which
led
to
the
success
of
napoleon
in
and
when
he
directed
his
line
upon
the
extremity
of
the
strategic
front
or
we
might
adopt
his
plan
which
was
successful
in
and
of
directing
the
line
of
operations
upon
the
center
of
the
strategic
front
all
of
which
is
to
be
determined
by
the
respective
positions
of
the
armies
and
according
to
the
maxims
presented
in
article
xxi
in
selecting
judicious
eventual
lines
of
maneuver
by
giving
them
such
directions
as
always
to
be
able
to
act
with
the
greater
mass
of
the
forces
and
to
prevent
the
parts
of
the
enemy
from
concentrating
or
from
affording
each
other
mutual
support
in
combining
in
the
same
spirit
of
centralization
all
strategic
positions
and
all
large
detachments
made
to
cover
the
most
important
strategic
points
of
the
theater
of
war
in
imparting
to
the
troops
the
greatest
possible
mobility
and
activity
so
as
by
their
successive
employment
upon
points
where
it
may
be
important
to
act
to
bring
superior
force
to
bear
upon
fractions
of
the
hostile
army
the
system
of
rapid
and
continuous
marches
multiplies
the
effect
of
an
army
and
at
the
same
time
neutralizes
a
great
part
of
that
of
the
enemy
and
is
often
sufficient
to
insure
success
but
its
effect
will
be
quintupled
if
the
marches
be
skillfully
directed
upon
the
decisive
strategic
points
of
the
zone
of
operations
where
the
severest
blows
to
the
enemy
can
be
given
however
as
a
general
may
not
always
be
prepared
to
adopt
this
decisive
course
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
he
must
then
be
content
with
attaining
a
part
of
the
object
of
every
enterprise
by
rapid
and
successive
employment
of
his
forces
upon
isolated
bodies
of
the
enemy
thus
insuring
their
defeat
a
general
who
moves
his
masses
rapidly
and
continually
and
gives
them
proper
directions
may
be
confident
both
of
gaining
victories
and
of
securing
great
results
therefrom
the
operations
of
and
prove
these
truths
most
satisfactorily
as
also
does
that
ordered
by
carnot
in
already
mentioned
in
article
and
the
details
of
which
may
be
found
in
volume
iv
of
my
history
of
the
wars
of
the
revolution
forty
battalions
carried
successively
from
dunkirk
to
menin
maubeuge
and
landau
by
reinforcing
the
armies
already
at
those
points
gained
four
victories
and
saved
france
the
whole
science
of
marches
would
have
been
found
in
this
wise
operation
had
it
been
directed
upon
the
decisive
strategic
point
the
austrian
was
then
the
principal
army
of
the
coalition
and
its
line
of
retreat
was
upon
cologne
hence
it
was
upon
the
meuse
that
a
general
effort
of
the
french
would
have
inflicted
the
most
severe
blow
the
committee
of
public
safety
provided
for
the
most
pressing
danger
and
the
maneuver
contains
half
of
the
strategic
principle
the
other
half
consists
in
giving
to
such
efforts
the
most
decisive
direction
as
napoleon
did
at
ulm
at
jena
and
at
ratisbon
the
whole
of
strategy
is
contained
in
these
four
examples
it
is
superfluous
to
add
that
one
of
the
great
ends
of
strategy
is
to
be
able
to
assure
real
advantages
to
the
army
by
preparing
the
theater
of
war
most
favorable
for
its
operations
if
they
take
place
in
its
own
country
by
the
location
of
fortified
places
of
intrenched
camps
and
of
de
and
by
the
opening
of
communications
in
the
great
decisive
directions
these
constitute
not
the
least
interesting
part
of
the
science
we
have
already
seen
how
we
are
to
recognize
these
lines
and
these
decisive
points

permanent
or
temporary

afforded
instruction
on
this
point

battles
are
the
actual
conflicts
of
armies
contending
about
great
questions
of

of

victories
grand
tactics
is
the
art
of
making
good
combinations
preliminary
to
battles
as
well
as
during
their
progress
the
guiding
principle
in
tactical
combinations
as
in
those
of
strategy
is
to
bring
the
mass
of
the
force
in
hand
against
a
part
of
the
opposing
army
and
upon
that
point
the
possession
of
which
promises
the
most
important
results
battles
have
been
stated
by
some
writers
to
be
the
chief
and
deciding
features
of
war
this
assertion
is
not
strictly
true
as
armies
have
been
destroyed
by
strategic
operations
without
the
occurrence
of
pitched
battles
by
a
succession
of
inconsiderable
affairs
it
is
also
true
that
a
complete
and
decided
victory
may
give
rise
to
results
of
the
same
character
when
there
may
have
been
no
grand
strategic
combinations
the
results
of
a
battle
generally
depend
upon
a
union
of
causes
which
are
not
always
within
the
scope
of
the
military
art
the
nature
of
the
order
of
battle
adopted
the
greater
or
less
wisdom
displayed
in
the
plan
of
the
battle
as
well
as
the
manner
of
carrying
out
its
details
the
more
or
less
loyal
and
enlightened
of
the
officers
subordinate
to
the
the
cause
of
the
contest
the
proportions
and
quality
of
the
troops
their
greater
or
less
enthusiasm
superiority
on
the
one
side
or
the
other
in
artillery
or
cavalry
and
the
manner
of
handling
these
arms
but
it
is
the
of
armies
as
well
as
of
nations
more
than
any
thing
else
which
makes
victories
and
their
results
decisive
clausewitz
commits
a
grave
error
in
asserting
that
a
battle
not
characterized
by
a
maneuver
to
turn
the
enemy
can
not
result
in
a
complete
victory
at
the
battle
of
zama
hannibal
in
a
few
brief
hours
saw
the
fruits
of
twenty
years
of
glory
and
success
vanish
before
his
eyes
although
scipio
never
had
a
thought
of
turning
his
position
at
rivoli
the
was
completely
beaten
nor
was
the
maneuver
more
successful
at
stockach
in
or
at
austerlitz
in
as
is
evident
from
article
i
by
no
means
intend
to
discourage
the
use
of
that
maneuver
being
on
the
contrary
a
constant
advocate
of
it
but
it
is
very
important
to
know
how
to
use
it
skillfully
and
opportunely
and
i
am
moreover
of
opinion
that
if
it
be
a
design
to
make
himself
master
of
his
enemy
communications
while
at
the
same
time
holding
his
own
he
would
do
better
to
employ
strategic
than
tactical
combinations
to
accomplish
it
there
are
three
kinds
of
battles
defensive
battles
or
those
fought
by
armies
in
favorable
positions
taken
up
to
await
the
attack
offensive
battles
where
one
army
attacks
another
in
position
battles
fought
unexpectedly
and
resulting
from
the
collision
of
two
armies
meeting
on
the
march
we
will
examine
in
succession
the
different
combinations
they
present

positions
and
defensive
battles
when
an
army
awaits
an
attack
it
takes
up
a
position
and
forms
its
line
of
battle
from
the
general
definitions
given
at
the
beginning
of
this
work
it
will
appear
that
i
make
a
distinction
between
of
and
of
things
which
have
been
constantly
confounded
i
will
designate
as
a
of
the
position
occupied
by
battalions
either
deployed
or
in
columns
of
attack
which
an
army
will
take
up
to
hold
a
camp
and
a
certain
portion
of
ground
where
it
will
await
attack
having
no
particular
project
in
view
for
the
future
it
is
the
right
name
to
give
to
a
body
of
troops
formed
with
proper
tactical
intervals
and
distances
upon
one
or
more
lines
as
will
be
more
fully
explained
in
article
xliii
on
the
contrary
i
will
designate
as
an
of
an
arrangement
of
troops
indicating
an
intention
to
execute
a
certain
maneuver
as
for
example
the
parallel
order
the
oblique
order
the
perpendicular
order
this
nomenclature
although
new
seems
necessary
to
keeping
up
a
proper
distinction
between
two
things
which
should
by
no
means
be
confounded
from
the
nature
of
the
two
things
it
is
evident
that
the
of
belongs
especially
to
defensive
arrangements
because
an
army
awaiting
an
attack
without
knowing
what
or
where
it
will
be
must
necessarily
form
a
rather
indefinite
and
objectless
line
of
battle
of
on
the
contrary
indicating
an
arrangement
of
troops
formed
with
an
intention
of
fighting
while
executing
some
maneuver
previously
determined
upon
belongs
more
particularly
to
offensive
dispositions
however
it
is
by
no
means
pretended
that
the
line
of
battle
is
exclusively
a
defensive
arrangement
for
a
body
of
troops
may
in
this
formation
very
well
proceed
to
the
attack
of
a
position
while
an
army
on
the
defensive
may
use
the
oblique
order
or
any
other
i
refer
above
only
to
ordinary
cases
without
adhering
strictly
to
what
is
called
the
system
of
a
war
of
positions
an
army
may
often
find
it
proper
to
await
the
enemy
at
a
favorable
point
strong
by
nature
and
selected
beforehand
for
the
purpose
of
there
fighting
a
defensive
battle
such
a
position
may
be
taken
up
when
the
object
is
to
cover
an
important
objective
point
such
as
a
capital
large
depots
or
a
decisive
strategic
point
which
controls
the
surrounding
country
or
finally
to
cover
a
siege
there
are
two
kinds
of
positions
the
which
has
been
discussed
in
article
and
the
the
latter
again
are
subdivided
in
the
first
place
there
are
intrenched
positions
occupied
to
await
the
enemy
under
cover
of
works
more
or
less
connected
in
a
word
intrenched
camps
their
relations
to
strategic
operations
have
been
treated
in
article
and
their
attack
and
defense
are
discussed
in
article
xxxv
secondly
we
have
positions
naturally
strong
where
armies
encamp
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
a
few
days
time
third
and
last
are
open
positions
chosen
in
advance
to
fight
on
the
defensive
the
characteristics
to
be
sought
in
these
positions
vary
according
to
the
object
in
view
it
is
however
a
matter
of
importance
not
to
be
carried
away
by
the
mistaken
idea
which
prevails
too
extensively
of
giving
the
preference
to
positions
that
are
very
steep
and
difficult
of
access
quite
suitable
places
probably
for
temporary
camps
but
not
always
the
best
for
a
position
of
this
kind
to
be
really
strong
must
be
not
only
steep
and
difficult
of
access
but
should
be
adapted
to
the
end
had
in
view
in
occupying
it
should
offer
as
many
advantages
as
possible
for
the
kind
of
troops
forming
the
principal
strength
of
the
army
and
finally
the
obstacles
presented
by
its
features
should
be
more
disadvantageous
for
the
enemy
than
for
the
assailed
for
example
it
is
certain
that
massena
in
taking
the
strong
position
of
the
albis
would
have
made
a
great
error
if
his
chief
strength
had
been
in
cavalry
and
artillery
whilst
it
was
exactly
what
was
wanted
for
his
excellent
infantry
for
the
same
reason
wellington
whose
whole
dependence
was
in
the
fire
of
his
troops
made
a
good
choice
of
position
at
waterloo
where
all
the
avenues
of
approach
were
well
swept
by
his
guns
the
position
of
the
albis
was
moreover
rather
a
strategic
position
that
of
waterloo
being
simply
a
the
rules
to
be
generally
observed
in
selecting
tactical
positions
are
the
following
to
have
the
communications
to
the
front
such
as
to
make
it
easier
to
fall
upon
the
enemy
at
a
favorable
moment
than
for
him
to
approach
the
line
of
battle
to
give
the
artillery
all
its
effect
in
the
defense
to
have
the
ground
suitable
for
concealing
the
movements
of
troops
between
the
wings
that
they
may
be
massed
upon
any
point
deemed
the
proper
one
to
be
able
to
have
a
good
view
of
the
enemy
movements
to
have
an
unobstructed
line
of
retreat
to
have
the
flanks
well
protected
either
by
natural
or
artificial
obstacles
so
as
to
render
impossible
an
attack
upon
their
extremities
and
to
oblige
the
enemy
to
attack
the
center
or
at
least
some
point
of
the
front
this
is
a
difficult
condition
to
fulfill
for
if
an
army
rests
on
a
river
or
a
mountain
or
an
impenetrable
forest
and
the
smallest
reverse
happens
to
it
a
great
disaster
may
be
the
result
of
the
broken
line
being
forced
back
upon
the
very
obstacles
which
seemed
to
afford
perfect
protection
this
danger
about
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
gives
rise
to
the
thought
that
points
admitting
an
easy
defense
are
better
on
a
than
insurmountable
obstacles
sometimes
a
want
of
proper
support
for
the
flanks
is
remedied
by
throwing
a
crotchet
to
the
rear
this
is
dangerous
because
a
crotchet
stuck
on
a
line
hinders
its
movements
and
the
enemy
may
cause
great
loss
of
life
by
placing
his
artillery
in
the
angle
of
the
two
lines
prolonged
a
strong
reserve
in
close
column
behind
the
wing
to
be
guarded
from
assault
seems
better
to
fulfill
the
required
condition
than
the
crotchet
but
the
nature
of
the
ground
must
always
decide
in
the
choice
between
the
two
methods
full
details
on
this
point
are
given
in
the
description
of
the
battle
of
prague
chapter
ii
of
the
seven
years
war
we
must
endeavor
in
a
defensive
position
not
only
to
cover
the
flanks
but
it
often
happens
that
there
are
obstacles
on
other
points
of
the
front
of
such
a
character
as
to
compel
an
attack
upon
the
center
such
a
position
will
always
be
one
of
the
most
advantageous
for
defense
as
was
shown
at
malplaquet
and
waterloo
great
obstacles
are
not
essential
for
this
purpose
as
the
smallest
accident
of
the
ground
is
sometimes
sufficient
thus
the
insignificant
rivulet
of
papelotte
forced
ney
to
attack
wellington
center
instead
of
the
left
as
he
had
been
ordered
when
a
defense
is
made
of
such
a
position
care
must
be
taken
to
hold
ready
for
movement
portions
of
the
wings
thus
covered
in
order
that
they
may
take
part
in
the
action
instead
of
remaining
idle
spectators
of
it
the
fact
can
not
be
concealed
however
that
all
these
means
are
but
palliatives
and
the
best
thing
for
an
army
standing
on
the
defensive
is
to
how
to
take
the
offensive
at
a
proper
time
and
take
among
the
conditions
to
be
satisfied
by
a
defensive
position
has
been
mentioned
that
of
enabling
an
easy
and
safe
retreat
and
this
brings
us
to
an
examination
of
a
question
presented
by
the
battle
of
waterloo
would
an
army
with
its
rear
resting
upon
a
forest
and
with
a
good
road
behind
the
center
and
each
wing
have
its
retreat
compromised
as
napoleon
imagined
if
it
should
lose
the
battle
my
own
opinion
is
that
such
a
position
would
be
more
favorable
for
a
retreat
than
an
entirely
open
field
for
a
beaten
army
could
not
cross
a
plain
without
exposure
to
very
great
danger
undoubtedly
if
the
retreat
becomes
a
rout
a
portion
of
the
artillery
left
in
battery
in
front
of
the
forest
would
in
all
probability
be
lost
but
the
infantry
and
cavalry
and
a
great
part
of
the
artillery
could
retire
just
as
readily
as
across
a
plain
there
is
indeed
no
better
cover
for
an
orderly
retreat
than
a
forest
this
statement
being
made
upon
the
supposition
that
there
are
at
least
two
good
roads
behind
the
line
that
proper
measures
for
retreat
have
been
taken
before
the
enemy
has
had
an
opportunity
to
press
too
closely
and
finally
that
the
enemy
is
not
permitted
by
a
flank
movement
to
be
before
the
retreating
army
at
the
outlet
of
the
forest
as
was
the
case
at
hohenlinden
the
retreat
would
be
the
more
secure
if
as
at
waterloo
the
forest
formed
a
concave
line
behind
the
center
for
this
would
become
a
place
of
arms
to
receive
the
troops
and
give
them
time
to
pass
off
in
succession
on
the
main
roads
when
discussing
strategic
operations
mention
was
made
of
the
varying
chances
which
the
two
systems
the
and
the
give
rise
to
and
it
was
seen
that
especially
in
strategy
the
army
taking
the
initiative
has
the
great
advantage
of
bringing
up
its
troops
and
striking
a
blow
where
it
may
deem
best
whilst
the
army
which
acts
upon
the
defensive
and
awaits
an
attack
is
anticipated
in
every
direction
is
often
taken
unawares
and
is
always
obliged
to
regulate
its
movements
by
those
of
the
enemy
we
have
also
seen
that
in
tactics
these
advantages
are
not
so
marked
because
in
this
case
the
operations
occupy
a
smaller
extent
of
ground
and
the
party
taking
the
initiative
can
not
conceal
his
movements
from
the
enemy
who
instantly
observing
may
at
once
counteract
them
by
the
aid
of
a
good
reserve
moreover
the
party
advancing
upon
the
enemy
has
against
him
all
the
disadvantages
arising
from
accidents
of
ground
that
he
must
pass
before
reaching
the
hostile
line
and
however
flat
a
country
it
may
be
there
are
always
inequalities
of
the
surface
such
as
small
ravines
thickets
hedges
villages
which
must
either
be
taken
possession
of
or
be
passed
by
to
these
natural
obstacles
may
also
be
added
the
batteries
to
be
carried
and
the
disorder
which
always
prevails
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
in
a
body
of
men
exposed
to
a
continued
fire
either
of
musketry
or
artillery
viewing
the
matter
in
the
light
of
these
facts
all
must
agree
that
in
tactical
operations
the
advantages
resulting
from
taking
the
initiative
are
balanced
by
the
disadvantages
however
undoubted
these
truths
may
be
there
is
another
still
more
manifest
which
has
been
demonstrated
by
the
greatest
events
of
history
every
army
which
maintains
a
strictly
defensive
attitude
must
if
attacked
be
at
last
driven
from
its
position
whilst
by
profiting
by
all
the
advantages
of
the
defensive
system
and
holding
itself
ready
to
take
the
offensive
when
occasion
offers
it
may
hope
for
the
greatest
success
a
general
who
stands
motionless
to
receive
his
enemy
keeping
strictly
on
the
defensive
may
fight
ever
so
bravely
but
he
must
give
way
when
properly
attacked
it
is
not
so
however
with
a
general
who
indeed
waits
to
receive
his
enemy
but
with
the
determination
to
fall
upon
him
offensively
at
the
proper
moment
to
wrest
from
him
and
transfer
to
his
own
troops
the
moral
effect
always
produced
by
an
onward
movement
when
coupled
with
the
certainty
of
throwing
the
main
strength
into
the
action
at
the
most
important
point
a
thing
altogether
impossible
when
keeping
strictly
on
the
defensive
in
fact
a
general
who
occupies
a
position
where
his
movements
are
free
has
the
advantage
of
observing
the
enemy
approach
his
forces
previously
arranged
in
a
suitable
manner
upon
the
position
aided
by
batteries
placed
so
as
to
produce
the
greatest
effect
may
make
the
enemy
pay
very
dearly
for
his
advance
over
the
space
separating
the
two
armies
and
when
the
assailant
after
suffering
severely
finds
himself
strongly
assailed
at
the
moment
when
the
victory
seemed
to
be
in
his
hands
the
advantage
will
in
all
probability
be
his
no
longer
for
the
moral
effect
of
such
a
upon
the
part
of
an
adversary
supposed
to
be
beaten
is
certainly
enough
to
stagger
the
boldest
troops
a
general
may
therefore
employ
in
his
battles
with
equal
success
either
the
offensive
or
defensive
system
but
it
is
indispensable
that
so
far
from
limiting
himself
to
a
passive
defense
he
should
know
how
to
take
the
offensive
at
favorable
moments
that
his
be
certain
and
his
coolness
undoubted
that
he
be
able
to
rely
surely
upon
his
troops
that
in
retaking
the
offensive
he
should
by
no
means
neglect
to
apply
the
general
principle
which
would
have
regulated
his
order
of
battle
had
he
done
so
in
the
beginning
that
he
strike
his
blows
upon
decisive
points

truths
are
demonstrated
by

at

offensive
battles
and
different
orders
of
battle
we
understand
by
offensive
battles
those
which
an
army
fights
when
assaulting
another
in
position
an
army
reduced
to
the
strategic
defensive
often
takes
the
offensive
by
making
an
attack
and
an
army
receiving
an
attack
may
during
the
progress
of
the
battle
take
the
offensive
and
obtain
the
advantages
incident
to
it
history
furnishes
numerous
examples
of
battles
of
each
of
these
kinds
as
defensive
battles
have
been
discussed
in
the
preceding
article
and
the
advantages
of
the
defensive
been
pointed
out
we
will
now
proceed
to
the
consideration
of
offensive
movements
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
assailant
generally
has
a
moral
advantage
over
the
assailed
and
almost
always
acts
more
understandingly
than
the
latter
who
must
be
more
or
less
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
as
soon
as
it
is
determined
to
attack
the
enemy
some
order
of
attack
must
be
adopted
and
that
is
what
i
have
thought
ought
to
be
called
of
it
happens
also
quite
frequently
that
a
battle
must
be
commenced
without
a
detailed
plan
because
the
position
of
the
enemy
is
not
entirely
known
in
either
case
it
should
be
well
understood
that
there
is
in
every
a
decisive
point
the
possession
of
which
more
than
of
any
other
helps
to
secure
the
victory
by
enabling
its
holder
to
make
a
proper
application
of
the
principles
of
war
arrangements
should
therefore
be
made
for
striking
the
decisive
blow
upon
this
point
the
decisive
point
of
a
is
determined
as
has
been
already
stated
by
the
character
of
the
position
the
bearing
of
different
localities
upon
the
strategic
object
in
view
and
finally
by
the
arrangement
of
the
contending
forces
for
example
suppose
an
flank
to
rest
upon
high
ground
from
which
his
whole
line
might
be
attained
the
occupation
of
this
height
seems
most
important
tactically
considered
but
it
may
happen
that
the
height
in
question
is
very
difficult
of
access
and
situated
exactly
so
as
to
be
of
the
least
importance
strategically
considered
at
the
battle
of
bautzen
the
left
of
the
allies
rested
upon
the
steep
mountains
of
bohemia
which
province
was
at
that
time
rather
neutral
than
hostile
it
seemed
that
tactically
considered
the
slope
of
these
mountains
was
the
decisive
point
to
be
held
when
it
was
just
the
reverse
because
the
allies
had
but
one
line
of
retreat
upon
reichenbach
and
gorlitz
and
the
french
by
forcing
the
right
which
was
in
the
plain
would
occupy
this
line
of
retreat
and
throw
the
allies
into
the
mountains
where
they
might
have
lost
all
their
and
a
great
part
of
the
personnel
of
their
army
this
course
was
also
easier
for
them
on
account
of
the
difference
in
the
features
of
the
ground
led
to
more
important
results
and
would
have
diminished
the
obstacles
in
the
future
the
following
truths
may
i
think
be
deduced
from
what
has
been
stated
the
topographical
key
of
a
is
not
always
the
tactical
key
the
decisive
point
of
a
is
certainly
that
which
combines
strategic
with
topographical
advantages
when
the
difficulties
of
the
ground
are
not
too
formidable
upon
the
strategic
point
of
the
this
is
generally
the
most
important
point
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
the
determination
of
this
point
depends
very
much
upon
the
arrangement
of
the
contending
forces
thus
in
lines
of
battle
too
much
extended
and
divided
the
center
will
always
be
the
proper
point
of
attack
in
lines
well
closed
and
connected
the
center
is
the
strongest
point
since
independently
of
the
reserves
posted
there
it
is
easy
to
support
it
from
the
flanks
the
decisive
point
in
this
case
is
therefore
one
of
the
extremities
of
the
line
when
the
numerical
superiority
is
considerable
an
attack
may
be
made
simultaneously
upon
both
extremities
but
not
when
the
attacking
force
is
equal
or
inferior
numerically
to
the
enemy
it
appears
therefore
that
all
the
combinations
of
a
battle
consist
in
so
employing
the
force
in
hand
as
to
obtain
the
most
effective
action
upon
that
one
of
the
three
points
mentioned
which
offers
the
greatest
number
of
chances
of
success
a
point
very
easily
determined
by
applying
the
analysis
just
mentioned
the
object
of
an
offensive
battle
can
only
be
to
dislodge
the
enemy
or
to
cut
his
line
unless
it
is
intended
by
strategic
maneuvers
to
ruin
his
army
completely
an
enemy
is
dislodged
either
by
overthrowing
him
at
some
point
of
his
line
or
by
outflanking
him
so
as
to
take
him
in
flank
and
rear
or
by
using
both
these
methods
at
once
that
is
attacking
him
in
front
while
at
the
same
time
one
wing
is
enveloped
and
his
line
turned
to
accomplish
these
different
objects
it
becomes
necessary
to
make
choice
of
the
most
suitable
order
of
battle
for
the
method
to
be
used
at
least
twelve
orders
of
battle
may
be
enumerated
viz
the
simple
parallel
order
the
parallel
order
with
a
defensive
or
offensive
crotchet
the
order
reinforced
upon
one
or
both
wings
the
order
reinforced
in
the
center
the
simple
oblique
order
or
the
oblique
reinforced
on
the
attacking
wing
and
the
perpendicular
order
on
one
or
both
wings
the
concave
order
the
convex
order
the
order
by
echelon
on
one
or
both
wings
the
order
by
echelon
on
the
center
the
order
resulting
from
a
strong
combined
attack
upon
the
center
and
one
extremity
simultaneously
see
figs
to
illustration
fig
a
ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
b
each
of
these
orders
may
be
used
either
by
itself
or
as
has
been
stated
in
connection
with
the
maneuver
of
a
strong
column
intended
to
turn
the
enemy
line
in
order
to
a
proper
appreciation
of
the
merits
of
each
it
becomes
necessary
to
test
each
by
the
application
of
the
general
principles
which
have
been
laid
down
for
example
it
is
manifest
that
the
parallel
order
fig
is
worst
of
all
for
it
requires
no
skill
to
fight
one
line
against
another
battalion
against
battalion
with
equal
chances
of
success
on
either
side
no
tactical
skill
is
needed
in
such
a
battle
there
is
however
one
important
case
where
this
is
a
suitable
order
which
occurs
when
an
army
having
taken
the
initiative
in
great
strategic
operations
shall
have
succeeded
in
falling
upon
the
communications
and
cutting
off
his
line
of
retreat
while
covering
its
own
when
the
battle
takes
place
between
them
that
army
which
has
reached
the
rear
of
the
other
may
use
the
parallel
order
for
having
effected
the
decisive
maneuver
previous
to
the
battle
all
its
efforts
should
now
be
directed
toward
the
frustration
of
the
enemy
endeavor
to
open
a
way
through
for
himself
except
for
this
single
case
the
parallel
order
is
the
worst
of
all
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
a
battle
can
not
be
gained
while
using
this
order
for
one
side
or
the
other
must
gain
the
victory
if
the
contest
is
continued
and
the
advantage
will
then
be
upon
his
side
who
has
the
best
troops
who
best
knows
when
to
engage
them
who
best
manages
his
reserve

is
most
favored

the
parallel
order
with
a
crotchet
upon
the
flank
fig
is
most
usually
adopted
in
a
defensive
position
it
may
be
also
the
result
of
an
offensive
combination
but
then
the
crotchet
is
to
the
front
whilst
in
the
case
of
defense
it
is
to
the
rear
the
battle
of
prague
is
a
very
remarkable
example
of
the
danger

which
such
a
crotchet
is
exposed

attacked

more
favorable
than
the
two
preceding
ones
and

also
much
more
in
accordance
with
the
general
principles
which
have
been
laid
down
although
when
the
contending
forces
are
about
equal
the
part
of
the
line
which
has
been
weakened
to
reinforce
the
other
may
have
its
own
safety
compromised

placed

the
oblique
order

is
the
best
for
an
inferior
force
attacking
a
superior
for
in
addition
to
the
advantage
of
bringing
the
main
strength
of
the
forces
against
a
single
point
of
the
enemy
line
it
has
two
others
equally
important
since
the
weakened
wing
is
not
only
kept
back
from
the
attack
of
the
enemy
but
performs
also
the
double
duty
of
holding
in
position
the
part
of
his
line
not
attacked
and
of
being
at
hand
as
a
reserve
for
the
support
if
necessary
of
the
engaged
wing
this
order
was
used
by
the
celebrated
epaminondas
at
the
battles
of
leuctra

the
most
brilliant
example
of
its
use
in

only
be
considered
an
arrangement
to
indicate
the
direction
along
which
the
primary
tactical
movements
might
be
made
in
a
battle
two
armies
will
never
long
occupy
the
relative
perpendicular
positions
indicated
in
these
figures
for
if
the
army

were
to
take
its
first
position
on
a
line
perpendicular
to
one
or
both
extremities
of
the
army
a
the
latter
would
at
once
change
the
front
of
a
portion
of
its
line
and
even
the
army
b
as
soon
as
it
extended
itself
to
or
beyond
the
extremity
of
a
must
of
necessity
turn
its
columns
either
to
the
right
or
the
left
in
order
to
bring
them
near
the
enemy
line
and
so
take
him
in
reverse
as
at
c
the
result
being
two
oblique
lines
as
shown
in
fig
the
inference
is
that
one
division
of
the
assailing
army
would
take
a
position
perpendicular
to
the
enemy
wing
whilst
the
remainder
of
the
army
would
approach
in
front
for
the
purpose
of
annoying
him
and
this
would
always
bring
us
back
to
one
of
the
oblique
orders
shown
in
figures
and
the
attack
on
both
wings
whatever
be
the
form
of
attack
adopted
may
be
very
advantageous
but
it
is
only
admissible
when
the
assailant
is
very
decidedly
superior
in
numbers
for
if
the
fundamental
principle
is
to
bring
the
main
strength
of
the
forces
upon
the
decisive
point
a
weaker
army
would
violate
it
in
directing
a
divided
attack
against
a
superior
force
this
truth
will
be
clearly
demonstrated
farther
on
illustration
fig
the
order
concave
in
the
center
fig
has
found
advocates
since
the
day
when
hannibal
by
its
use
gained
the
battle
of
cannæ
this
order
may
indeed
be
very
good
when
the
progress
of
the
battle
itself
gives
rise
to
it
that
is
when
the
enemy
attacks
the
center
this
retires
before
him
and
he
suffers
himself
to
be
enveloped
by
the
wings
but
if
this
order
is
adopted
before
the
battle
begins
the
enemy
instead
of
falling
on
the
center
has
only
to
attack
the
wings
which
present
their
extremities
and
are
in
precisely
the
same
relative
situation
as
if
they
had
been
assailed
in
flank
this
order
would
therefore
be
scarcely
ever
used
except
against
an
enemy
who
had
taken
the
convex
order
to
fight
a
battle
as
will
be
seen
farther
on
illustration
fig
an
army
will
rarely
form
a
semicircle
preferring
rather
a
broken
line
with
the
center
retired
fig
if
several
writers
may
be
believed
such
an
arrangement
gave
the
victory
to
the
english
on
the
famous
days
of
crécy
and
agincourt
this
order
is
certainly
better
than
a
semicircle
since
it
does
not
so
much
present
the
flank
to
attack
whilst
allowing
forward
movement
by
echelon
and
preserving
all
the
advantages
of
concentration
of
fire
these
advantages
vanish
if
the
enemy
instead
of
foolishly
throwing
himself
upon
the
retired
center
is
content
to
watch
it
from
a
distance
and
makes
his
greatest
effort
upon
one
wing
essling
in
is
an
example
of
the
advantageous
use
of
a
concave
line
but
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
napoleon
committed
an
error
in
attacking
the
center
for
an
army
fighting
with
the
danube
behind
it
and
with
no
way
of
moving
without
uncovering
its
bridges
of
communication
must
not
be
judged
as
if
it
had
been
free
to
maneuver
at
pleasure
illustration

the
convex
order

answers
for
an
engagement
immediately
upon
the
passage
of
a
river

the
wings
must
be
retired
and
rested
on
the
river

to
be
fought
with
a
river
in
rear
which
is
to
be
passed

the
defile
covered

at
leipsic
and
finally
it
may
become
a
natural
formation
to
resist
an
enemy
forming
a
concave
line
if
an
enemy
directs
his
efforts
against
the
center
or
against
a
single
wing
this
order
might
cause
the
ruin
of
the
whole
army
the
french
tried
it
at
fleurus
in
and
were
successful
because
the
prince
of
coburg
in
place
of
making
a
strong
attack
upon
the
center

upon
a
single
extremity
divided
his
attack
upon
five

six
diverging
lines

upon

may
be
used
with
special
success
against
an
army
occupying
a
position
too
much
cut
up
and
too
extended
because
its
center
being
then
somewhat
isolated
from
the
wings
and
liable
to
overthrow
the
army
thus
cut
in
two
would
be
probably
destroyed
but
applying
the
test
of
the
same
fundamental
principle
this
order
of
attack
would
appear
to
be
less
certain
of
success
against
an
army
having
a
connected
and
closed
line
for
the
reserve
being
generally
near
the

the
wings
being
able
to
act
either
by
concentrating
their
fire
or
by
moving
against
the
foremost
echelons
might
readily
repulse
them
if
this
formation
to
some
extent
resembles
the
famous
triangular
wedge
or
of
the
ancients
and
the
column
of
winkelried
it
also
differs
from
them
essentially
for
instead
of
forming
one
solid
mass
an
impracticable
thing
in
our
day
on
account
of
the
use
of
artillery
it
would
have
a
large
open
space
in
the
middle
which
would
render
movements
more
easy
this
formation
is
suitable
as
has
been
said
for
penetrating
the
center
of
a
line
too
much
extended
and
might
be
equally
successful
against
a
line
unavoidably
immovable
but
if
the
wings
of
the
attacked
line
are
brought
at
a
proper
time
against
the
flanks
of
the
foremost
echelons
disagreeable
consequences
might
result
a
parallel
order
considerably
reinforced
on
the
center
might
perhaps
be
a
much
better
arrangement
figs
and
for
the
parallel
line
in
this
case
would
have
at
least
the
advantage
of
deceiving
the
enemy
as
to
the
point
of
attack
and
would
hinder
the
wings
from
taking
the
echelons
of
the
center
by
the
flank
this
order
by
echelons
was
adopted
by
laudon
for
the
attack
of
the
intrenched
camp
of
buntzelwitz

on
grand
operations
chapter
xxviii
in
such
a
case
it
is
quite
suitable
for
it
is
then
certain
that
the
defensive
army
being
forced
to
remain
within
its
intrenchments
there
is
no
danger
of
its
attacking
the
echelons
in
flank
but
this
formation
having
the
inconvenience
of
indicating
to
the
enemy
the
point
of
his
line
which
it
is
desired
to
attack
false
attacks
should
be
made
upon
the
wings
to
mislead
him
as
to
the
true
point
of

the

and

is
better
than
the
preceding
especially
in
an
attack
upon
an
enemy
line
strongly
arranged
and
well
connected
it
may
even
be
called
the
most
reasonable
of
all
the
orders
of
battle
the
attack
upon
the
center
aided
by
a
wing
outflanking
the
enemy
prevents
the
assailed
party
falling
upon
the
assailant
and
taking
him
in
flank
as
was
done
by
hannibal
and
marshal
saxe
the
enemy
wing
which
is
hemmed
in
between
the
attacks
on
the
center
and
at
the
extremity
having
to
contend
with
nearly
the
entire
opposing
force
will
be
defeated
and
probably
destroyed
it
was
this
maneuver
which
gave
napoleon
his
victories
of
wagram
and
ligny
this
was
what
he
wished
to
attempt
at
borodino
where
he
obtained
only
a
partial
success
on
account
of
the
heroic
conduct
of
the
russian
left
and
the
division
of
paskevitch
in
the
famous
central
redoubt
and
on
account
of
the
arrival
of
corps
on
the
wing
he
hoped
to
outflank
he
used
it
also
at
bautzen
where
an
unprecedented
success
would
have
been
the
result
but
for
an
accident
which
interfered
with
the
maneuver
of
the
left
wing
intended
to
cut
off
the
allies
from
the
road
to
wurschen
every
arrangement
having
been
made
with
that
view
it
should
be
observed
that
these
different
orders
are
not
to
be
understood
precisely
as
the
geometrical
figures
indicate
them
a
general
who
would
expect
to
arrange
his
line
of
battle
as
regularly
as
upon
paper
or
on
a
would
be
greatly
mistaken
and
would
be
likely
to
suffer
defeat
this
is
particularly
true
as
battles
are
now
fought
in
the
time
of
louis
xiv
or
of
frederick
it
was
possible
to
form
lines
of
battle
almost
as
regular
as
the
geometrical
figures
because
armies
camped
under
tents
almost
always
closely
collected
together
and
were
in
presence
of
each
other
several
days
thus
giving
ample
time
for
opening
roads
and
clearing
spaces
to
enable
the
columns
to
be
at
regular
distances
from
each
other
but
in
our
day
when
armies
bivouac
when
their
division
into
several
corps
gives
greater
mobility
when
they
take
position
near
each
other
in
obedience
to
orders
given
them
while
out
of
reach
of
the
general
eye
and
often
when
there
has
been
no
time
for
thorough
examination
of
the
enemy
position
finally
when
the
different
arms
of
the
service
are
intermingled
in
the
line
of
battle
under
these
circumstances
all
orders
of
battle
which
must
be
laid
out
with
great
accuracy
of
detail
are
impracticable
these
figures
have
never
been
of
any
other
use
than
to
indicate
approximate
arrangements
if
every
army
were
a
solid
mass
capable
of
motion
as
a
unit
under
the
influence
of
one
man
will
and
as
rapidly
as
thought
the
art
of
winning
battles
would
be
reduced
to
choosing
the
most
favorable
order
of
battle
and
a
general
could
reckon
with
certainty
upon
the
success
of
maneuvers
arranged
beforehand
but
the
facts
are
altogether
different
for
the
great
difficulty
of
the
tactics
of
battles
will
always
be
to
render
certain
the
simultaneous
entering
into
action
of
the
numerous
fractions
whose
efforts
must
combine
to
make
such
an
attack
as
will
give
good
ground
to
hope
for
victory
in
other
words
the
chief
difficulty
is
to
cause
these
fractions
to
unite
in
the
execution
of
the
decisive
maneuver
which
in
accordance
with
the
original
plan
of
the
battle
is
to
result
in
victory
inaccurate
transmission
of
orders
the
manner
in
which
they
will
be
understood
and
executed
by
the
subordinates
of
the
excess
of
activity
in
some
lack
of
it
in
others
a
defective
every
thing
of
this
kind
may
interfere
with
the
simultaneous
entering
into
action
of
the
different
parts
without
speaking
of
the
accidental
circumstances
which
may
delay
or
prevent
the
arrival
of
a
corps
at
the
appointed
place
hence
result
two
undoubted
truths
the
more
simple
a
decisive
maneuver
is
the
more
sure
of
success
will
it
be
sudden
maneuvers
seasonably
executed
during
an
engagement
are
more
likely
to
succeed
than
those
determined
upon
in
advance
unless
the
latter
relating
to
previous
strategic
movements
will
bring
up
the
columns
which
are
to
decide
the
day
upon
those
points
where
their
presence
will
secure
the
expected
result
waterloo
and
bautzen
are
proofs
of
the
last
from
the
moment
when
blücher
and
bulow
had
reached
the
heights
of
frichermont
nothing
could
have
prevented
the
loss
of
the
battle
by
the
french
and
they
could
then
only
fight
to
make
the
defeat
less
complete
in
like
manner
at
bautzen
as
soon
as
ney
had
reached
klix
the
retreat
of
the
allies
during
the
night
of
the
of
may
could
alone
have
saved
them
for
on
the
it
was
too
late
and
if
ney
had
executed
better
what
he
was
advised
to
do
the
victory
would
have
been
a
very
great
one
as
to
maneuvers
for
breaking
through
a
line
and
calculations
upon
the
of
columns
proceeding
from
the
general
front
of
the
army
with
the
intention
of
effecting
large
detours
around
an
enemy
flank
it
may
be
stated
that
their
result
is
always
doubtful
since
it
depends
upon
such
an
accurate
execution
of
plans
as
is
rarely
seen
this
subject
will
be
considered
in
art
xxxii
besides
the
difficulty
of
depending
upon
the
exact
application
of
an
order
of
battle
arranged
in
advance
it
often
happens
that
battles
begin
without
even
the
assailant
having
a
object
although
the
collision
may
have
been
expected
this
uncertainty
results
either
from
circumstances
prior
to
the
battle
from
ignorance
of
the
position
and
plans
or
from
the
fact
that
a
portion
of
the
army
may
be
still
expected
to
arrive
on
the
field
from
these
things
many
people
have
concluded
that
it
is
impossible
to
reduce
to
different
systems
the
formations
of
orders
of
battle
or
that
the
adoption
of
either
of
them
can
at
all
influence
the
result
of
an
engagement
an
erroneous
conclusion
in
my
opinion
even
in
the
cases
cited
above
indeed
in
battles
begun
without
any
predetermined
plan
it
is
probable
that
at
the
opening
of
the
engagement
the
armies
will
occupy
lines
nearly
parallel
and
more
or
less
strengthened
upon
some
point
the
party
acting
upon
the
defensive
not
knowing
in
what
quarter
the
storm
will
burst
upon
him
will
hold
a
large
part
of
his
forces
in
reserve
to
be
used
as
occasion
may
require
the
assailant
must
make
similar
efforts
to
have
his
forces
well
in
hand
but
as
soon
as
the
point
of
attack
shall
have
been
determined
the
mass
of
his
troops
will
be
directed
against
the
center
or
upon
one
wing
of
the
enemy
or
upon
both
at
once
whatever
may
be
the
resulting
formation
it
will
always
bear
a
resemblance
to
one
of
the
figures
previously
exhibited
even
in
unexpected
engagements
the
same
thing
would
happen
which
will
it
is
hoped
be
a
sufficient
proof
of
the
fact
that
this
classification
of
the
different
systems
or
orders
of
battle
is
neither
fanciful
nor
useless
there
is
nothing
even
in
napoleon
battles
which
disproves
my
assertion
although
they
are
less
susceptible
than
any
others
of
being
represented
by
lines
accurately
laid
down
we
see
him
however
at
rivoli
at
austerlitz
and
at
ratisbon
concentrating
his
forces
toward
the
center
to
be
ready
at
the
favorable
moment
to
fall
upon
the
enemy
at
the
pyramids
he
formed
an
oblique
line
of
squares
in
echelon
at
leipsic
essling
and
brienne
he
used
a
kind
of
convex
order
very
like
fig
at
wagram
his
order
was
altogether
like
fig
bringing
up
two
masses
upon
the
center
and
right
while
keeping
back
the
left
wing
and
this
he
wished
to
repeat
at
borodino
and
at
waterloo
before
the
prussians
came
up
at
eylau
although
the
collision
was
almost
entirely
unforeseen
on
account
of
the
very
unexpected
return
and
offensive
movement
of
the
russians
he
outflanked
their
left
almost
perpendicularly
whilst
in
another
direction
he
was
endeavoring
to
break
through
the
center
but
these
attacks
were
not
simultaneous
that
on
the
center
being
repulsed
at
eleven
whilst
davoust
did
not
attack
vigorously
upon
the
left
until
toward
one
at
dresden
he
attacked
by
the
two
wings
for
the
first
time
probably
in
his
life
because
his
center
was
covered
by
a
fortification
and
an
intrenched
camp
and
in
addition
the
attack
of
his
left
was
combined
with
that
of
vandamme
upon
the
enemy
line
of
retreat
at
marengo
if
we
may
credit
napoleon
himself
the
oblique
order
he
assumed
resting
his
right
at
castel
ceriole
saved
him
from
almost
inevitable
defeat
ulm
and
jena
were
battles
won
by
strategy
before
they
were
fought
tactics
having
but
little
to
do
with
them
at
ulm
there
was
not
even
a
regular
battle
i
think
we
may
hence
conclude
that
if
it
seems
absurd
to
desire
to
mark
out
upon
the
ground
orders
of
battle
in
such
regular
lines
as
would
be
used
in
tracing
them
on
a
sketch
a
skillful
general
may
nevertheless
bear
in
mind
the
orders
which
have
been
indicated
above
and
may
so
combine
his
troops
on
the
that
the
arrangement
shall
be
similar
to
one
of
them
he
should
endeavor
in
all
his
combinations
whether
deliberately
arranged
or
adopted
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
form
a
sound
conclusion
as
to
the
important
point
of
the
and
this
he
can
only
do
by
observing
well
the
direction
of
the
line
of
battle
and
not
forgetting
the
direction
in
which
strategy
requires
him
to
operate
he
will
then
give
his
attention
and
efforts
to
this
point
using
a
third
of
his
force
to
keep
the
enemy
in
check
or
watch
his
movements
while
throwing
the
other
upon
the
point
the
possession
of
which
will
insure
him
the
victory
acting
thus
he
will
have
satisfied
all
the
conditions
the
science
of
grand
tactics
can
impose
upon
him
and
will
have
applied
the
principles
of
the
art
in
the
most
perfect
manner
the
manner
of
determining
the
decisive
point
of
a
has
been
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
art
xix
having
now
explained
the
twelve
orders
of
battle
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
this
would
be
a
proper
place
to
reply
to
several
statements
made
in
the
memoirs
of
napoleon
published
by
general
montholon
the
great
captain
seems
to
consider
the
oblique
order
a
modern
invention
a
theorist
fancy
an
opinion
i
can
by
no
means
share
for
the
oblique
order
is
as
old
as
thebes
and
sparta
and
i
have
seen
it
used
with
my
own
eyes
this
assertion
of
napoleon
seems
the
more
remarkable
because
napoleon
himself
boasted
of
having
used
at
marengo
the
very
order
of
which
he
thus
denies
the
existence
if
we
understand
that
the
oblique
order
is
to
be
applied
in
the
rigid
and
precise
manner
inculcated
by
general
ruchel
at
the
berlin
school
napoleon
was
certainly
right
in
regarding
it
as
an
absurdity
but
i
repeat
that
a
line
of
battle
never
was
a
regular
geometrical
figure
and
when
such
figures
are
used
in
discussing
the
combinations
of
tactics
it
can
only
be
for
the
purpose
of
giving
definite
expression
to
an
idea
by
the
use
of
a
known
symbol
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
every
line
of
battle
which
is
neither
parallel
nor
perpendicular
to
the
enemy
must
be
oblique
of
necessity
if
one
army
attacks
the
extremity
of
another
army
the
attacking
wing
being
reinforced
by
massing
troops
upon
it
while
the
weakened
wing
is
kept
retired
from
attack
the
direction
of
the
line
must
of
necessity
be
a
little
oblique
since
one
end
of
it
will
be
nearer
the
enemy
than
the
other
the
oblique
order
is
so
far
from
being
a
mere
fancy
that
we
see
it
used
when
the
order
is
that
by
echelons
on
one
wing
fig
as
to
the
other
orders
of
battle
explained
above
it
can
not
be
denied
that
at
essling
and
fleurus
the
general
arrangement
of
the
austrians
was
a
concave
line
and
that
of
the
french
a
convex
in
these
orders
parallel
lines
may
be
used
as
in
the
case
of
straight
lines
and
they
would
be
classified
as
belonging
to
the
parallel
system
when
no
part
of
the
line
was
more
strongly
occupied
or
drawn
up
nearer
to
the
enemy
than
another
laying
aside
for
the
present
further
consideration
of
these
geometrical
figures
it
is
to
be
observed
that
for
the
purpose
of
fighting
battles
in
a
truly
scientific
manner
the
following
points
must
be
attended
to
an
offensive
order
of
battle
should
have
for
its
object
to
force
the
enemy
from
his
position
by
all
reasonable
means
the
maneuvers
indicated
by
art
are
those
intended
to
overwhelm
one
wing
only
or
the
center
and
one
wing
at
the
same
time
an
enemy
may
also
be
dislodged
by
maneuvers
for
outflanking
and
turning
his
position
these
attempts
have
a
much
greater
probability
of
success
if
concealed
from
the
enemy
until
the
very
moment
of
the
assault
to
attack
the
center
and
both
wings
at
the
same
time
without
having
very
superior
forces
would
be
entirely
in
opposition
to
the
rules
of
the
art
unless
one
of
these
attacks
can
be
made
very
strongly
without
weakening
the
line
too
much
at
the
other
points
the
oblique
order
has
no
other
object
than
to
unite
at
least
half
the
force
of
the
army
in
an
overwhelming
attack
upon
one
wing
while
the
remainder
is
retired
to
the
rear
out
of
danger
of
attack
being
arranged
either
in
echelon
or
in
a
single

otherwise
may

throughout
or
by

at

point
the
object
of

being
to
defeat
the
plans
of
the
attacking
party
the
arrangements
of
a
defensive
order
should
be
such
as
to
multiply
the
difficulties
of
approaching
the
position
and
to
keep
in
hand
a
strong
reserve
well
concealed
and
ready
to
fall
at
the
decisive
moment
upon
a
point
where
the
enemy
least
expect
to
meet
it
it
is
difficult
to
state
with
precision
what
is
the
best
method
to
use
in
forcing
a
hostile
army
to
abandon
its
position
an
order
of
battle
would
be
perfect
which
united
the
double
advantages
of
the
fire
of
the
arms
and
of
the
moral
effect
produced
by
an
onset
a
skillful
mixture
of
deployed
lines
and
columns
acting
alternately
as
circumstances
require
will
always
be
a
good
combination
in
the
practical
use
of
this
system
many
variations
must
arise
from
differences
in
the
of
commanders
the
of
officers
and
soldiers
their
familiarity
with
maneuvers
and
firings
of
all
sorts
from
varying
localities
as
it
is
essential
in
an
offensive
battle
to
drive
the
enemy
from
his
position
and
to
cut
him
up
as
much
as
possible
the
best
means
of
accomplishing
this
is
to
use
as
much
material
force
as
can
be
accumulated
against
him
it
sometimes
happens
however
that
the
direct
application
of
main
force
is
of
doubtful
utility
and
better
results
may
follow
from
maneuvers
to
outflank
and
turn
that
wing
which
is
nearest
the
enemy
line
of
retreat
he
may
when
thus
threatened
retire
when
he
would
fight
strongly
and
successfully
if
attacked
by
main
force
history
is
full
of
examples
of
the
success
of
such
maneuvers
especially
when
used
against
generals
of
weak
character
and
although
victories
thus
obtained
are
generally
less
decisive
and
the
hostile
army
is
but
little
demoralized
such
incomplete
successes
are
of
sufficient
importance
not
to
be
neglected
and
a
skillful
general
should
know
how
to
employ
the
means
to
gain
them
when
opportunity
offers
and
especially
should
he
combine
these
turning
movements
with
attacks
by
main
force
the
combination
of
these
two
methods
that
is
to
say
the
attack
in
front
by
main
force
and
the
turning
maneuver
will
render
the
victory
more
certain
than
the
use
of
either
separately
but
in
all
cases
too
extended
movements
must
be
avoided
even
in
presence
of
a
contemptible
enemy
the
manner
of
driving
an
enemy
from
his
position
by
main
force
is
the
following
throw
his
troops
into
confusion
by
a
heavy
and
fire
of
artillery
increase
this
confusion
by
vigorous
charges
of
cavalry
and
follow
up
the
advantages
thus
gained
by
pushing
forward
masses
of
infantry
well
covered
in
front
by
skirmishers
and
flanked
by
cavalry
but
while
we
may
expect
success
to
follow
such
an
attack
upon
the
first
line
the
second
is
still
to
be
overcome
and
after
that
the
reserve
and
at
this
period
of
the
engagement
the
attacking
party
would
usually
be
seriously
embarrassed
did
not
the
moral
effect
of
the
defeat
of
the
first
line
often
occasion
the
retreat
of
the
second
and
cause
the
general
in
command
to
lose
his
presence
of
mind
in
fact
the
attacking
troops
will
usually
be
somewhat
disordered
even
in
victory
and
it
will
often
be
very
difficult
to
replace
them
by
those
of
the
second
line
because
they
generally
follow
the
first
line
at
such
a
distance
as
not
to
come
within
of
the
enemy
and
it
is
always
embarrassing
to
substitute
one
division
for
another
in
the
heat
of
battle
at
the
moment
when
the
enemy
is
putting
forth
all
his
strength
in
repelling
the
attack
these
considerations
lead
to
the
belief
that
if
the
general
and
the
troops
of
the
defensive
army
are
equally
active
in
the
performance
of
their
duty
and
preserve
their
presence
of
mind
if
their
flanks
and
line
of
retreat
are
not
threatened
the
advantage
will
usually
be
on
their
side
at
the
second
collision
of
the
battle
but
to
insure
that
result
their
second
line
and
the
cavalry
must
be
launched
against
the
victorious
battalions
of
the
adversary
at
the
proper
instant
for
the
loss
of
a
few
minutes
may
be
irreparable
and
the
second
line
may
be
drawn
into
the
confusion
of
the
first
from
the
preceding
facts
may
be
deduced
the
following
truth
that
the
most
difficult
as
well
as
the
most
certain
of
all
the
means
the
assailant
may
use
to
gain
the
victory
consists
in
strongly
supporting
the
first
line
with
the
troops
of
the
second
line
and
these
with
the
reserve
and
in
a
proper
employment
of
masses
of
cavalry
and
of
batteries
to
assist
in
striking
the
decisive
blow
at
the
second
line
of
the
enemy
for
here
is
presented
the
greatest
of
all
the
problems
of
the
tactics
of
battles
in
this
important
crisis
of
battles
theory
becomes
an
uncertain
guide
for
it
is
then
unequal
to
the
emergency
and
can
never
compare
in
value
with
a
natural
talent
for
war
nor
be
a
sufficient
substitute
for
that
intuitive
imparted
by
experience
in
battles
to
a
general
of
tried
bravery
and
coolness
the
simultaneous
employment
of
the
largest
number
of
troops
of
all
arms
combined
except
a
small
reserve
of
each
which
should
be
always
held
in
hand
will
therefore
at
the
critical
moment
of
the
battle
be
the
problem
which
every
skillful
general
will
attempt
to
solve
and
to
which
he
should
give
his
whole
attention
this
critical
moment
is
usually
when
the
first
line
of
the
parties
is
broken
and
all
the
efforts
of
both
contestants
are
put
forth
on
the
one
side
to
complete
the
victory
on
the
other
to
wrest
it
from
the
enemy
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
to
make
this
decisive
blow
more
certain
and
effectual
a
simultaneous
attack
upon
the
enemy
flank
would
be
very
advantageous
in
the
defensive
the
fire
of
musketry
can
be
much
more
effectively
used
than
in
the
offensive
since
when
a
position
is
to
be
carried
it
can
be
accomplished
only
by
moving
upon
it
and
marching
and
firing
at
the
same
time
can
be
done
only
by
troops
as
skirmishers
being
an
impossibility
for
the
principal
masses
the
object
of
the
defense
being
to
break
and
throw
into
confusion
the
troops
advancing
to
the
attack
the
fire
of
artillery
and
musketry
will
be
the
natural
defensive
means
of
the
first
line
and
when
the
enemy
presses
too
closely
the
columns
of
the
second
line
and
part
of
the
cavalry
must
be
launched
against
him
there
will
then
be
a
strong
probability
of
his
repulse

turning
maneuvers
and
too
extended
movement
in
battles
we
have
spoken
in
the
preceding
article
of
maneuvers
undertaken
to
turn
an
enemy
line
upon
the
and
of
the
advantages
which
may
be
expected
from
them
a
few
words
remain
to
be
said
as
to
the
wide
détours
which
these
maneuvers
sometimes
occasion
causing
the
failure
of
so
many
plans
seemingly
well
arranged
it
may
be
laid
down
as
a
principle
that
any
movement
is
dangerous
which
is
so
extended
as
to
give
the
enemy
an
opportunity
while
it
is
taking
place
of
beating
the
remainder
of
the
army
in
position
nevertheless
as
the
danger
depends
very
much
upon
the
rapid
and
certain
of
the
opposing
general
as
well
as
upon
the
style
of
warfare
to
which
he
is
accustomed
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
why
so
many
maneuvers
of
this
kind
have
failed
against
some
commanders
and
succeeded
against
others
and
why
such
a
movement
which
would
have
been
hazardous
in
presence
of
frederick
napoleon
or
wellington
might
have
entire
success
against
a
general
of
limited
capacity
who
had
not
the
tact
to
take
the
offensive
himself
at
the
proper
moment
or
who
might
himself
have
been
in
the
habit
of
moving
in
this
manner
it
seems
therefore
difficult
to
lay
down
a
fixed
rule
on
the
subject
the
following
directions
are
all
that
can
be
given
keep
the
mass
of
the
force
well
in
hand
and
ready
to
act
at
the
proper
moment
being
careful
however
to
avoid
the
danger
of
accumulating
troops
in
too
large
bodies
a
commander
observing
these
precautions
will
be
always
prepared
for
any
thing
that
may
happen
if
the
opposing
general
shows
little
skill
and
seems
inclined
to
indulge
in
extended
movements
his
adversary
may
be
more
daring
a
few
examples
drawn
from
history
will
serve
to
convince
the
reader
of
the
truth
of
my
statements
and
to
show
him
how
the
results
of
these
extended
movements
depend
upon
the
characters
of
the
generals
and
the
armies
concerned
in
them
in
the
seven
years
war
frederick
gained
the
battle
of
prague
because
the
austrians
had
left
a
interval
of
one
thousand
yards
between
their
right
and
the
remainder
of
their
army
the
latter
part
remaining
motionless
while
the
right
was
overwhelmed
this
inaction
was
the
more
extraordinary
as
the
left
of
the
austrians
had
a
much
shorter
distance
to
pass
over
in
order
to
support
their
right
than
frederick
had
to
attack
it
for
the
right
was
in
the
form
of
a
crotchet
and
frederick
was
obliged
to
move
on
the
arc
of
a
large
semicircle
to
reach
it
on
the
other
hand
frederick
came
near
losing
the
battle
of
torgau
because
he
made
with
his
left
a
movement
entirely
too
extended
and
disconnected
nearly
six
miles
with
a
view
of
turning
the
right
of
marshal
daun
mollendorf
brought
up
the
right
by
a
concentric
movement
to
the
heights
of
siptitz
where
he
rejoined
the
king
whose
line
was
thus
reformed
the
battle
of
rivoli
is
a
noted
instance
in
point
all
who
are
familiar
with
that
battle
know
that
alvinzi
and
his
chief
of
staff
weyrother
wished
to
surround
napoleon
little
army
which
was
concentrated
on
the
plateau
of
rivoli
their
center
was
beaten
while
their
left
was
piled
up
in
the
ravine
of
the
adige
and
lusignan
with
their
right
was
making
a
wide
to
get
upon
the
rear
of
the
french
army
where
he
was
speedily
surrounded
and
captured
no
one
can
forget
the
day
of
stockach
where
jourdan
conceived
the
unfortunate
idea
of
causing
an
attack
to
be
made
upon
a
united
army
of
sixty
thousand
men
by
three
small
divisions
of
seven
thousand
or
eight
thousand
men
separated
by
distances
of
several
leagues
whilst
with
the
third
of
the
army
thirteen
thousand
men
was
to
pass
twelve
miles
beyond
the
right
flank
and
get
in
rear
of
this
army
of
sixty
thousand
men
which
could
not
help
being
victorious
over
these
divided
fractions
and
should
certainly
have
captured
the
part
in
their
rear
escape
was
indeed
little
less
than
a
miracle
we
may
call
to
mind
how
this
same
general
weyrother
who
had
desired
to
surround
napoleon
at
rivoli
attempted
the
same
maneuver
at
austerlitz
in
spite
of
the
severe
lesson
he
had
formerly
received
the
left
wing
of
the
allied
army
wishing
to
outflank
napoleon
right
to
cut
him
off
from
vienna
where
he
did
not
desire
to
return
by
a
circular
movement
of
nearly
six
miles
opened
an
interval
of
a
mile
and
a
half
in
their
line
napoleon
took
advantage
of
this
mistake
fell
upon
the
center
and
surrounded
their
left
which
was
completely
shut
up
between
lakes
tellnitz
and
melnitz
wellington
gained
the
battle
of
salamanca
by
a
maneuver
very
similar
to
napoleon
because
marmont
who
wished
to
cut
off
his
retreat
to
portugal
left
an
opening
of
a
mile
and
a
half
in
his
line
seeing
which
the
english
general
entirely
defeated
his
left
wing
that
had
no
support
if
weyrother
had
been
opposed
to
jourdan
at
rivoli
or
at
austerlitz
he
might
have
destroyed
the
french
army
instead
of
suffering
in
each
case
a
total
defeat
for
the
general
who
at
stockach
attacked
a
mass
of
sixty
thousand
men
with
four
small
bodies
of
troops
so
much
separated
as
to
be
unable
to
give
mutual
aid
would
not
have
known
how
to
take
proper
advantage
of
a
wide
detour
effected
in
his
presence
in
the
same
way
marmont
was
unfortunate
in
having
at
salamanca
an
adversary
whose
chief
merit
was
a
rapid
and
practiced
tactical
with
the
duke
of
york
or
moore
for
an
antagonist
marmont
would
probably
have
been
successful
among
the
turning
maneuvers
which
have
succeeded
in
our
day
waterloo
and
hohenlinden
had
the
most
brilliant
results
of
these
the
first
was
almost
altogether
a
strategic
operation
and
was
attended
with
a
rare
concurrence
of
fortunate
circumstances
as
to
hohenlinden
we
will
search
in
vain
in
military
history
for
another
example
of
a
single
brigade
venturing
into
a
forest
in
the
midst
of
fifty
thousand
enemies
and
there
performing
such
astonishing
feats
as
richepanse
effected
in
the
defile
of
matenpoet
where
he
might
have
expected
in
all
probability
to
lay
down
his
arms
at
wagram
the
turning
wing
under
davoust
contributed
greatly
to
the
successful
issue
of
the
day
but
if
the
vigorous
attack
upon
the
center
under
macdonald
oudinot
and
bernadotte
had
not
rendered
opportune
assistance
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
a
like
success
would
have
been
the
result
so
many
examples
of
conflicting
results
might
induce
the
conclusion
that
no
rule
on
this
subject
can
be
given
but
this
would
be
erroneous
for
it
seems
on
the
contrary
quite
evident
that
by
adopting
as
a
rule
an
order
of
battle
well
closed
and
well
connected
a
general
will
find
himself
prepared
for
any
emergency
and
little
will
be
left
to
chance
but
it
is
specially
important
for
him
to
have
a
correct
estimate
of
his
enemy
character
and
his
usual
style
of
warfare
to
enable
him
to
regulate
his
own
actions
accordingly
in
case
of
superiority
in
numbers
or
discipline
maneuvers
may
be
attempted
which
would
be
imprudent
were
the
forces
equal
or
the
commanders
of
the
same
capacity
a
maneuver
to
outflank
and
turn
a
wing
should
be
connected
with
other
attacks
and
opportunely
supported
by
an
attempt
of
the
remainder
of
the
army
on
the
enemy
front
either
against
the
wing
turned
or
against
the
center
finally
strategic
operations
to
cut
an
enemy
line
of
communications
before
giving
battle
and
attack
him
in
rear
the
assailing
army
preserving
its
own
line
of
retreat
are
much
more
likely
to
be
successful
and
effectual
and
moreover
they
require
no
disconnected
maneuver
during
the
battle

in
war
in
the
greater
number
of
battles
one
party
awaits
his
enemy
in
a
position
chosen
in
advance
which
is
attacked
after
a
reconnoissance
as
close
and
accurate
as
possible
it
often
happens
however
especially
as
war
is
now
carried
on
that
two
armies
approach
each
other
each
intending
to
make
an
unexpected
attack
upon
the
other
a
collision
ensues
unexpected
by
both
armies
since
each
finds
the
other
where
it
does
not
anticipate
a
meeting
one
army
may
also
be
attacked
by
another
which
has
prepared
a
surprise
for
it
as
happened
to
the
french
at
rossbach
a
great
occasion
of
this
kind
calls
into
play
all
the
genius
of
a
skillful
general
and
of
the
warrior
able
to
control
events
it
is
always
possible
to
gain
a
battle
with
brave
troops
even
where
the
commander
may
not
have
great
capacity
but
victories
like
those
of
lutzen
luzzara
eylau
abensberg
can
only
be
gained
by
a
brilliant
genius
endowed
with
great
coolness
and
using
the
wisest
combinations
there
is
so
much
chance
in
these
accidental
battles
that
it
is
by
no
means
easy
to
lay
down
precise
rules
concerning
them
but
these
are
the
very
cases
in
which
it
is
necessary
to
keep
clearly
before
the
mind
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
art
and
the
different
methods
of
applying
them
in
order
to
a
proper
arrangement
of
maneuvers
that
must
be
decided
upon
at
the
instant
and
in
the
midst
of
the
crash
of
resounding
arms
two
armies
marching
as
they
formerly
did
with
all
their
and
meeting
unexpectedly
could
do
nothing
better
at
first
than
cause
their
advanced
guard
to
deploy
to
the
right
or
left
of
the
roads
they
are
traversing
in
each
army
the
forces
should
at
the
same
time
be
concentrated
so
that
they
may
be
thrown
in
a
proper
direction
considering
the
object
of
the
march
a
grave
error
would
be
committed
in
deploying
the
whole
army
behind
the
advanced
guard
because
even
if
the
deployment
were
accomplished
the
result
would
be
nothing
more
than
a
parallel
order
and
if
the
enemy
pressed
the
advanced
guard
with
considerable
vigor
the
consequence
might
be
the
rout
of
the
troops
which
were
forming
see
the
account
of
the
battle
of
rossbach
treatise
on
grand
operations
in
the
modern
system
when
armies
are
more
easily
moved
marching
upon
several
roads
and
divided
into
masses
which
may
act
independently
these
routs
are
not
so
much
to
be
feared
but
the
principles
are
unchanged
the
advanced
guard
must
always
be
halted
and
formed
and
then
the
mass
of
the
troops
concentrated
in
that
direction
which
is
best
suited
for
carrying
out
the
object
of
the
march
whatever
maneuvers
the
enemy
may
then
attempt
every
thing
will
be
in
readiness
to
meet
him
article
xxxiv
of
surprises
of
armies
i
shall
not
speak
here
of
surprises
of
small
detachments
the
chief
features
in
the
wars
of
partisan
or
light
troops
for
which
the
light
russian
and
turkish
cavalry
are
so
well
adapted
i
shall
confine
myself
to
an
examination
of
the
surprise
of
whole
armies
before
the
invention
of
surprises
were
more
easily
effected
than
at
present
for
the
reports
of
artillery
and
musketry
firing
are
heard
to
so
great
a
distance
that
the
surprise
of
an
army
is
now
next
to
an
impossibility
unless
the
first
duties
of
are
forgotten
and
the
enemy
is
in
the
midst
of
the
army
before
his
presence
is
known
because
there
are
no
outposts
to
give
the
alarm
the
seven
years
war
presents
a
memorable
example
in
the
surprise
of
hochkirch
it
shows
that
a
surprise
does
not
consist
simply
in
falling
upon
troops
that
are
sleeping
or
keeping
a
poor
but
that
it
may
result
from
the
combination
of
a
sudden
attack
upon
and
a
surrounding
of
one
extremity
of
the
army
in
fact
to
surprise
an
army
it
is
not
necessary
to
take
it
so
entirely
unawares
that
the
troops
will
not
even
have
emerged
from
their
tents
but
it
is
sufficient
to
attack
it
in
force
at
the
point
intended
before
preparations
can
be
made
to
meet
the
attack
as
armies
at
the
present
day
seldom
camp
in
tents
when
on
a
march
prearranged
surprises
are
rare
and
difficult
because
in
order
to
plan
one
it
becomes
necessary
to
have
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
camp
at
marengo
at
lutzen
and
at
eylau
there
was
something
like
a
surprise
but
this
term
should
only
be
applied
to
an
entirely
unexpected
attack
the
only
great
surprise
to
be
cited
is
the
case
of
taroutin
in
where
murat
was
attacked
and
beaten
by
benningsen
to
excuse
his
imprudence
murat
pretended
that
a
secret
armistice
was
in
force
but
there
was
really
nothing
of
the
kind
and
he
was
surprised
through
his
own
negligence
it
is
evident
that
the
most
favorable
manner
of
attacking
an
army
is
to
fall
upon
its
camp
just
before
daybreak
at
the
moment
when
nothing
of
the
sort
is
expected
confusion
in
the
camp
will
certainly
take
place
and
if
the
assailant
has
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
locality
and
can
give
a
suitable
tactical
and
strategic
direction
to
the
mass
of
his
forces
he
may
expect
a
complete
success
unless
unforeseen
events
occur
this
is
an
operation
by
no
means
to
be
despised
in
war
although
it
is
rare
and
less
brilliant
than
a
great
strategic
combination
which
renders
the
victory
certain
even
before
the
battle
is
fought
for
the
same
reason
that
advantage
should
be
taken
of
all
opportunities
for
surprising
an
adversary
the
necessary
precautions
should
be
used
to
prevent
such
attacks
the
regulations
for
the
government
of
any
army
should
point
out
the
means
for
doing
the
last
article
xxxv
of
the
attack
by
main
force
of
fortified
places
intrenched
camps
or
of
coups
de
main
in
general
there
are
many
fortified
places
which
although
not
regular
fortresses
are
regarded
as
secure
against
de
but
may
nevertheless
be
carried
by
escalade
or
assault
or
through
breaches
not
altogether
practicable
but
so
steep
as
to
require
the
use
of
ladders
or
some
other
means
of
getting
to
the
parapet
the
attack
of
a
place
of
this
kind
presents
nearly
the
same
combinations
as
that
of
an
intrenched
camp
for
both
belong
to
the
class
of
de
this
kind
of
attack
will
vary
with
circumstances
with
the
strength
of
the
works
with
the
character
of
the
ground
on
which
they
are
built
with
the
fact
of
their
being
isolated
or
connected
with
the
morale
of
the
respective
parties
history
gives
us
examples
of
all
of
these
varieties
for
examples
take
the
intrenched
camps
of
kehl
dresden
and
warsaw
the
lines
of
turin
and
mayence
the
intrenchments
of
feldkirch
scharnitz
and
assiette
here
i
have
mentioned
several
cases
each
with
varying
circumstances
and
results
at
kehl
the
intrenchments
were
better
connected
and
better
constructed
than
at
warsaw
there
was
in
fact
a
de
nearly
equal
to
a
permanent
fortification
for
the
archduke
thought
himself
obliged
to
besiege
it
in
form
and
it
would
have
been
extremely
hazardous
for
him
to
make
an
open
attack
upon
it
at
warsaw
the
works
were
isolated
but
of
considerable
relief
and
they
had
as
a
keep
a
large
city
surrounded
by
loopholed
walls
armed
and
defended
by
a
number
of
desperate
men
dresden
in
had
for
a
keep
a
bastioned
enceinte
one
front
of
which
however
was
dismantled
and
had
no
other
parapet
than
such
as
was
suited
to
a
the
camp
proper
was
protected
by
simple
redoubts
at
considerable
distances
apart
very
poorly
built
the
keep
giving
it
its
sole
strength
at
mayence
and
at
turin
there
were
continuous
lines
of
circumvallation
but
if
in
the
first
case
they
were
strong
they
were
certainly
not
so
at
turin
where
upon
one
of
the
important
points
there
was
an
insignificant
parapet
with
a
command
of
three
feet
and
a
ditch
proportionally
deep
in
the
latter
case
also
the
lines
were
between
two
fires
as
they
were
attacked
in
rear
by
a
strong
garrison
at
the
moment
when
prince
eugene
assailed
them
from
without
at
mayence
the
lines
were
attacked
in
front
only
a
small
detachment
having
succeeded
in
passing
around
the
right
flank
the
tactical
measures
to
be
taken
in
the
attack
of
are
few
in
number
if
it
seems
probable
that
a
work
may
be
surprised
if
attacked
a
little
before
day
it
is
altogether
proper
to
make
the
attempt
but
if
this
operation
may
be
recommended
in
case
of
an
isolated
work
it
is
by
no
means
to
be
expected
that
a
large
army
occupying
an
intrenched
camp
will
permit
itself
to
be
surprised
especially
as
the
regulations
of
all
services
require
armies
to
stand
to
their
arms
at
dawn
as
an
attack
by
main
force
seems
likely
to
be
the
method
followed
in
this
case
the
following
simple
and
reasonable
directions
are
laid
down
silence
the
guns
of
the
work
by
a
powerful
which
at
the
same
time
has
the
effect
of
discouraging
the
defenders
provide
for
the
troops
all
the
materials
necessary
such
as
fascines
and
short
ladders
to
enable
them
to
pass
the
ditch
and
mount
the
parapet
direct
three
small
columns
upon
the
work
to
be
taken
skirmishers
preceding
them
and
reserves
being
at
hand
for
their
support
take
advantage
of
every
irregularity
of
the
ground
to
get
cover
for
the
troops
and
keep
them
sheltered
as
long
as
possible
give
detailed
instructions
to
the
principal
columns
as
to
their
duties
when
a
work
shall
have
been
carried
and
as
to
the
manner
of
attacking
the
troops
occupying
the
camp
designate
the
bodies
of
cavalry
which
are
to
assist
in
attacking
those
troops
if
the
ground
permits
when
all
these
arrangements
are
made
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
but
to
bring
up
the
troops
to
the
attack
as
actively
as
possible
while
a
detachment
makes
an
attempt
at
the
gorge
hesitancy
and
delay
in
such
a
case
are
worse
than
the
most
daring
rashness
those
gymnastic
exercises
are
very
useful
which
prepare
soldiers
for
escalades
and
passing
obstacles
and
the
engineers
may
with
great
advantage
give
their
attention
to
providing
means
for
facilitating
the
passage
of
the
ditches
of
and
climbing
their
parapets
among
all
the
arrangements
in
cases
of
this
kind
of
which
i
have
read
none
are
better
than
those
for
the
assault
of
warsaw
and
the
intrenched
camp
of
mayence
thielke
gives
a
description
of
laudon
dispositions
for
attacking
the
camp
of
buntzelwitz
which
although
not
executed
is
an
excellent
example
for
instruction
the
attack
of
warsaw
may
be
cited
as
one
of
the
finest
operations
of
this
sort
and
does
honor
to
marshal
paskevitch
and
the
troops
who
executed
it
as
an
example
not
to
be
followed
no
better
can
be
given
than
the
arrangements
made
for
attacking
dresden
in
among
attacks
of
this
class
may
be
mentioned
the
memorable
assaults
or
escalades
of
port
mahon
in
and
of
in
both
preceded
by
sieges
but
still
brilliant
de
since
in
neither
case
was
the
breach
sufficiently
large
for
a
regular
assault
continuous
intrenched
lines
although
seeming
to
have
a
better
interconnection
than
lines
of
detached
works
are
more
easily
carried
because
they
may
be
several
leagues
in
extent
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
prevent
an
enemy
from
breaking
through
them
at
some
point
the
capture
of
the
lines
of
mayence
and
wissembourg
which
are
described
in
the
history
of
the
wars
of
the
revolution
chapters
xxi
and
and
that
of
the
lines
of
turin
by
eugene
of
savoy
in
are
excellent
lessons
for
study
this
famous
event
at
turin
which
has
been
so
often
referred
to
is
so
familiar
to
all
readers
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
recall
the
details
of
it
but
i
can
not
pass
it
by
without
remarking
how
easily
the
victory
was
bought
and
how
little
it
should
have
been
expected
the
strategic
plan
was
certainly
admirable
and
the
march
from
the
adige
through
piacenza
to
asti
by
the
right
bank
of
the
po
leaving
the
french
on
the
mincio
was
beautifully
arranged
but
its
execution
was
exceedingly
slow
when
we
examine
the
operations
near
turin
we
must
confess
that
the
victors
owed
more
to
their
good
fortune
than
to
their
wisdom
it
required
no
great
effort
of
genius
upon
the
part
of
prince
eugene
to
prepare
the
order
he
issued
to
his
army
and
he
must
have
felt
a
profound
contempt
for
his
opponents
to
execute
a
march
with
thousand
allied
troops
of
ten
different
nations
between
eighty
thousand
frenchmen
on
the
one
side
and
the
alps
on
the
other
and
to
pass
around
their
camp
for
hours
by
the
most
remarkable
flank
march
that
was
ever
attempted
the
order
for
the
attack
was
so
brief
and
so
devoid
of
instruction
that
any
staff
officer
of
the
present
day
ought
to
write
a
better
directing
the
formation
of
eight
columns
of
infantry
by
brigade
in
two
lines
giving
them
orders
to
carry
the
intrenchments
and
to
make
openings
through
them
for
the
passage
of
the
cavalry
into
the
camp
make
up
the
sum
total
of
all
the
science
exhibited
by
eugene
in
order
to
carry
out
his
rash
undertaking
it
is
true
he
selected
the
weak
point
of
the
intrenchment
for
it
was
there
so
low
that
it
covered
only
half
the
bodies
of
its
defenders
but
i
am
wandering
from
my
subject
and
must
return
to
the
explanation
of
the
measures
most
suitable
for
adoption
in
an
attack
on
lines
if
they
have
a
sufficient
relief
to
make
it
difficult
to
carry
them
by
assault
and
if
on
the
other
hand
they
may
be
outflanked
or
turned
by
strategic
maneuvers
it
is
far
better
to
pursue
the
course
last
indicated
than
to
attempt
a
hazardous
assault
if
however
there
is
any
reason
for
preferring
the
attack
by
assault
it
should
be
made
upon
one
of
the
wings
because
the
center
is
the
point
most
easily
succored
there
have
been
cases
where
an
attack
on
the
wing
was
expected
by
the
defenders
and
they
have
been
deceived
by
a
false
attack
made
at
that
point
while
the
real
attack
took
place
at
the
center
and
succeeded
simply
because
unexpected
in
these
operations
the
locality
and
the
character
of
the
generals
engaged
must
decide
as
to
the
proper
course
to
be
pursued
the
attack
may
be
executed
in
the
manner
described
for
intrenched
camps
it
has
sometimes
happened
however
that
these
lines
have
had
the
relief
and
proportions
of
permanent
works
and
in
this
case
escalade
would
be
quite
difficult
except
of
old
earthen
works
whose
slopes
were
worn
away
from
the
lapse
of
time
and
had
become
accessible
for
infantry
of
moderate
activity
the
ramparts
of
ismail
and
praga
were
of
this
character
so
also
was
the
citadel
of
smolensk
which
paskevitch
so
gloriously
defended
against
ney
because
he
preferred
making
his
stand
at
the
ravines
in
front
rather
than
take
shelter
behind
a
parapet
with
an
inclination
of
scarcely
thirty
degrees
if
one
extremity
of
a
line
rests
upon
a
river
it
seems
absurd
to
think
of
penetrating
upon
that
wing
because
the
enemy
collecting
his
forces
the
mass
of
which
would
be
near
the
center
might
defeat
the
columns
advancing
between
the
center
and
the
river
and
completely
destroy
them
this
absurdity
however
has
sometimes
been
successful
because
the
enemy
driven
behind
his
lines
rarely
thinks
of
making
an
offensive
return
upon
the
assailant
no
matter
how
advantageous
it
might
seem
a
general
and
soldiers
who
seek
refuge
behind
lines
are
already
half
conquered
and
the
idea
of
taking
the
offensive
does
not
occur
to
them
when
their
intrenchments
are
attacked
notwithstanding
these
facts
i
can
not
advise
such
a
course
and
the
general
who
would
run
such
a
risk
and
meet
the
fate
of
tallard
at
blenheim
could
have
no
just
cause
of
complaint
very
few
directions
can
be
given
for
the
defense
of
intrenched
camps
and
lines
the
first
is
to
be
sure
of
having
strong
reserves
placed
between
the
center
and
each
wing
or
to
speak
more
accurately
on
the
right
of
the
left
wing
and
on
the
left
of
the
right
wing
with
this
arrangement
succor
can
be
easily
and
rapidly
carried
to
a
threatened
point
which
could
not
be
done
were
there
but
one
central
reserve
it
has
been
suggested
that
three
reserves
would
not
be
too
many
if
the
intrenchment
is
very
extensive
but
i
decidedly
incline
to
the
opinion
that
two
are
quite
enough
another
recommendation
may
be
given
and
it
is
of
great
importance
that
the
troops
be
made
to
understand
they
must
by
no
means
despair
of
finally
defending
a
line
which
may
be
forced
at
one
point
because
if
a
good
reserve
is
at
hand
it
may
take
the
offensive
attack
the
assailant
and
succeed
in
driving
him
out
of
the
work
he
may
have
supposed
in
his
power
coups
de
main
these
are
bold
enterprises
undertaken
by
a
detachment
of
an
army
for
the
capture
of
posts
of
different
strength
or
importance
they
partake
of
the
nature
both
of
surprises
and
attacks
by
main
force
for
both
these
methods
may
be
employed
in
carrying
an
attempt
of
this
sort
to
a
successful
issue
although
de
seem
to
be
entirely
tactical
operations
their
importance
certainly
depends
on
the
relations
of
the
captured
posts
to
the
strategic
combinations
in
hand
it
will
become
necessary
therefore
to
say
a
few
words
with
reference
to
coups
de
main
in
article
when
speaking
of
detachments
however
tiresome
these
repetitions
may
seem
i
am
obliged
to
state
here
the
manner
of
executing
such
operations
as
it
is
evidently
a
part
of
the
subject
of
the
attack
of
intrenchments
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
the
rules
of
tactics
apply
to
these
operations
for
their
name
de
implies
that
ordinary
rules
are
not
applicable
to
them
i
desire
only
to
call
attention
to
them
and
refer
my
readers
to
the
different
works
either
historical
or
didactic
where
they
are
mentioned
i
have
previously
stated
that
important
results
may
often
follow
from
these
enterprises
the
capture
of
sizeboli
in
the
unsuccessful
attack
of
general
petrasch
upon
kehl
in
the
remarkable
surprises
of
cremona
in
of
gibraltar
in
and
of
in
as
well
as
the
escalades
of
port
mahon
and
badajos
give
an
idea
of
the
different
kinds
of
de
some
are
effected
by
surprise
others
by
open
force
skill
stratagems
boldness
on
the
part
of
the
assailant
and
fear
excited
among
the
assailed
are
some
of
the
things
which
have
an
influence
upon
the
successful
issue
of
de
as
war
is
now
waged
the
capture
of
a
post
however
strong
is
no
longer
of
the
same
importance
as
formerly
unless
it
has
a
direct
influence
upon
the
results
of
a
great
strategic
operation
the
capture
or
destruction
of
a
bridge
defended
by
intrenchments
that
of
a
large
convoy
of
a
small
fort
closing
important
passes
like
the
two
attacks
which
were
made
in
upon
the
fort
of
lucisteig
in
the
grisons
the
capture
of
leutasch
and
scharnitz
by
ney
in
finally
the
capture
of
a
post
not
even
fortified
but
used
as
a
great
depot
of
provisions
and
munitions
much
needed
by
the
enemy
such
are
the
enterprises
which
will
justify
the
risks
to
which
a
detachment
engaging
in
them
may
be
exposed

been
captured

filling
up
the
ditches

with
fascines
sometimes
with

article

of
diversions
and
great
detachments
the
operations
of
the
detachments
an
army
may
send
out
have
so
important
a
bearing
on
the
success
of
a
campaign
that
the
duty
of
determining
their
strength
and
the
proper
occasions
for
them
is
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
delicate
responsibilities
imposed
upon
a
commander
if
nothing
is
more
useful
in
war
than
a
strong
detachment
opportunely
sent
out
and
having
a
good
of
operations
with
the
main
body
it
is
equally
certain
that
no
expedient
is
more
dangerous
when
inconsiderately
adopted
frederick
the
great
regarded
it
as
one
of
the
essential
qualities
of
a
general
to
know
how
to
make
his
adversary
send
out
many
detachments
either
with
the
view
of
destroying
them
in
detail
or
of
attacking
the
main
body
during
their
absence
the
division
of
armies
into
numerous
detachments
has
sometimes
been
carried
to
so
great
an
extent
and
with
such
poor
results
that
many
persons
now
believe
it
better
to
have
none
of
them
it
is
undoubtedly
much
safer
and
more
agreeable
for
an
army
to
be
kept
in
a
single
mass
but
it
is
a
thing
at
times
impossible
or
incompatible
with
gaining
a
complete
or
even
considerable
success
the
essential
point
in
this
matter
is
to
send
out
as
few
detachments
as
possible
there
are
several
kinds
of
detachments
there
are
large
corps
dispatched
to
a
distance
from
the
zone
of
operations
of
the
main
army
in
order
to
make
diversions
of
greater
or
less
importance
there
are
large
detachments
made
in
the
zone
of
operations
to
cover
important
points
of
this
zone
to
carry
on
a
siege
to
guard
a
secondary
base
or
to
protect
the
line
of
operations
if
threatened
there
are
large
detachments
made
upon
the
front
of
operations
in
face
of
the
enemy
to
act
in
concert
with
the
main
body
in
some
combined
operation
there
are
small
detachments
sent
to
a
distance
to
try
the
effect
of
surprise
upon
isolated
points
whose
capture
may
have
an
important
bearing
upon
the
general
operations
of
the
campaign
i
understand
by
diversions
those
secondary
operations
carried
out
at
a
distance
from
the
principal
zone
of
operations
at
the
extremities
of
a
theater
of
war
upon
the
success
of
which
it
is
sometimes
foolishly
supposed
the
whole
campaign
depends
such
diversions
are
useful
in
but
two
cases
the
first
of
which
arises
when
the
troops
thus
employed
can
not
conveniently
act
elsewhere
on
account
of
their
distance
from
the
real
theater
of
operations
and
the
second
is
that
where
such
a
detachment
would
receive
strong
support
from
the
population
among
which
it
was
sent
the
latter
case
belonging
rather
to
political
than
military
combinations
a
few
illustrative
examples
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
the
unfortunate
results
for
the
allied
powers
of
the
expedition
to
holland
and
of
that
of
the
archduke
charles
toward
the
end
of
the
last
century
which
have
been
referred
to
in
article
are
well
known
in
napoleon
was
occupying
naples
and
hanover
the
allies
intended
an
army
to
drive
him
out
of
italy
while
the
combined
forces
of
england
russia
and
sweden
should
drive
him
from
hanover
nearly
sixty
thousand
men
being
designed
for
these
two
points
but
while
their
troops
were
collecting
at
the
two
extremities
of
europe
napoleon
ordered
the
evacuation
of
naples
and
hanover
hastened
to
effect
a
junction
with
massena
in
the
frioul
and
bernadotte
leaving
hanover
moved
up
to
take
part
in
the
operations
of
ulm
and
austerlitz
after
these
astonishing
successes
napoleon
had
no
difficulty
in
retaking
naples
and
hanover
this
is
an
example
of
the
failure
of
diversions
i
will
give
an
instance
where
such
an
operation
would
have
been
proper
in
the
civil
wars
of
if
the
allies
had
sent
twenty
thousand
men
to
la
vendée
they
would
have
accomplished
much
more
than
by
increasing
the
numbers
of
those
who
were
fighting
fruitlessly
at
toulon
upon
the
rhine
and
in
belgium
here
is
a
case
where
a
diversion
would
have
been
not
only
very
useful
but
decisive
it
has
already
been
stated
that
besides
diversions
to
a
distance
and
of
small
bodies
large
corps
are
often
detached
in
the
zone
of
operations
of
the
main
army
if
the
employment
of
these
large
corps
thus
detached
for
secondary
objects
is
more
dangerous
than
the
diversions
above
referred
to
it
is
no
less
true
that
they
are
often
highly
proper
and
it
may
be
indispensable
these
great
detachments
are
chiefly
of
two
kinds
the
first
are
permanent
corps
which
must
be
sometimes
thrown
out
in
a
direction
opposite
to
the
main
line
of
operations
and
are
to
remain
throughout
a
campaign
the
second
are
corps
temporarily
detached
for
the
purpose
of
assisting
in
carrying
out
some
special
enterprise
among
the
first
should
be
especially
enumerated
those
fractions
of
an
army
that
are
detached
either
to
form
the
strategic
reserve
of
which
mention
has
been
made
or
to
cover
lines
of
operation
and
retreat
when
the
configuration
of
the
theater
of
the
war
exposes
them
to
attack
for
example
a
russian
army
that
wishes
to
cross
the
balkan
is
obliged
to
leave
a
portion
of
its
forces
to
observe
shumla
routchouk
and
the
valley
of
the
danube
whose
direction
is
perpendicular
to
its
line
of
operations
however
successful
it
may
be
a
respectable
force
must
always
be
left
toward
giurgevo
or
krajova
and
even
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
toward
routchouk
this
single
example
shows
that
it
is
sometimes
necessary
to
have
a
double
strategic
front
and
then
the
detachment
of
a
considerable
corps
must
be
made
to
offer
front
to
a
part
of
the
enemy
army
in
rear
of
the
main
army
other
localities
and
other
circumstances
might
be
mentioned
where
this
measure
would
be
equally
essential
to
safety
one
case
is
the
double
strategic
front
of
the
tyrol
and
the
frioul
for
a
french
army
passing
the
adige
on
whichever
side
it
may
wish
to
direct
its
main
column
a
detachment
must
be
left
on
the
other
front
sufficiently
strong
to
hold
in
check
the
enemy
threatening
to
cut
the
line
of
communications
the
third
example
is
the
frontier
of
spain
which
enables
the
spaniards
to
establish
a
double
front
one
covering
the
road
to
madrid
the
other
having
saragossa
or
galicia
as
a
base
to
whichever
side
the
invading
army
turns
a
detachment
must
be
left
on
the
other
proportioned
in
magnitude
to
the
enemy
force
in
that
direction
all
that
can
be
said
on
this
point
is
that
it
is
advantageous
to
enlarge
as
much
as
possible
the
field
of
operations
of
such
detachments
and
to
give
them
as
much
power
of
mobility
as
possible
in
order
to
enable
them
by
opportune
movements
to
strike
important
blows
a
most
remarkable
illustration
of
this
truth
was
given
by
napoleon
in
the
campaign
of
obliged
as
he
was
to
leave
a
corps
of
fifteen
thousand
men
in
the
valley
of
the
adige
to
observe
the
tyrol
while
he
was
operating
toward
the
noric
alps
he
preferred
to
draw
this
corps
to
his
aid
at
the
risk
of
losing
temporarily
his
line
of
retreat
rather
than
leave
the
parts
of
his
army
disconnected
and
exposed
to
defeat
in
detail
persuaded
that
he
could
be
victorious
with
his
army
united
he
apprehended
no
particular
danger
from
the
presence
of
a
few
hostile
detachments
upon
his
communications
great
movable
and
temporary
detachments
are
made
for
the
following
reasons
to
compel
your
enemy
to
retreat
to
cover
his
line
of
operations
or
else
to
cover
your
own
to
intercept
a
corps
and
prevent
its
junction
with
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
or
to
facilitate
the
approach
of
your
own
reinforcements
to
observe
and
hold
in
position
a
large
portion
of
the
opposing
army
while
a
blow
is
struck
at
the
remainder
to
carry
off
a
considerable
convoy
of
provisions
or
munitions
on
receiving
which
depended
the
continuance
of
a
siege
or
the
success
of
any
strategic
enterprise
or
to
protect
the
march
of
a
convoy
of
your
own
to
make
a
demonstration
to
draw
the
enemy
in
a
direction
where
you
wish
him
to
go
in
order
to
facilitate
the
execution
of
an
enterprise
in
another
direction
to
mask
or
even
to
invest
one
or
more
fortified
places
for
a
certain
time
with
a
view
either
to
attack
or
to
keep
the
garrison
shut
up
within
the
ramparts
to
take
possession
of
an
important
point
upon
the
communications
of
an
enemy
already
retreating
however
great
may
be
the
temptation
to
undertake
such
operations
as
those
enumerated
it
must
be
constantly
borne
in
mind
that
they
are
always
secondary
in
importance
and
that
the
essential
thing
is
to
be
successful
at
the
decisive
points
a
multiplication
of
detachments
must
therefore
be
avoided
armies
have
been
destroyed
for
no
other
reason
than
that
they
were
not
kept
together
we
will
here
refer
to
several
of
these
enterprises
to
show
that
their
success
depends
sometimes
upon
good
fortune
and
sometimes
upon
the
skill
of
their
designer
and
that
they
often
fail
from
faulty
execution
peter
the
great
took
the
first
step
toward
the
destruction
of
charles
xii
by
causing
the
seizure
by
a
strong
detachment
of
the
famous
convoy
lowenhaupt
was
bringing
up
villars
entirely
defeated
at
denain
the
large
detachment
prince
eugene
sent
out
in
under
the
destruction
of
the
great
convoy
laudon
took
from
frederick
during
the
siege
of
olmutz
compelled
the
king
to
evacuate
moravia
the
fate
of
the
two
detachments
of
fouquet
at
landshut
in
and
of
fink
at
maxen
in
demonstrates
how
difficult
it
is
at
times
to
avoid
making
detachments
and
how
dangerous
they
may
be
to
come
nearer
our
own
times
the
disaster
of
vandamme
at
culm
was
a
bloody
lesson
teaching
that
a
corps
must
not
be
thrust
forward
too
boldly
however
we
must
admit
that
in
this
case
the
operation
was
well
planned
and
the
fault
was
not
so
much
in
sending
out
the
detachment
as
in
not
supporting
it
properly
as
might
easily
have
been
done
that
of
fink
was
destroyed
at
maxen
nearly
on
the
same
spot
and
for
the
same
reason
diversions
or
demonstrations
in
the
zone
of
operations
of
the
army
are
decidedly
advantageous
when
arranged
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
the
enemy
attention
in
one
direction
while
the
mass
of
the
forces
is
collected
upon
another
point
where
the
important
blow
is
to
be
struck
in
such
a
case
care
must
be
taken
not
only
to
avoid
engaging
the
corps
making
the
demonstration
but
to
recall
it
promptly
toward
the
main
body
we
will
mention
two
examples
as
illustrations
of
these
facts
in
moreau
wishing
to
deceive
kray
as
to
the
true
direction
of
his
march
carried
his
left
wing
toward
rastadt
from
kehl
whilst
he
was
really
filing
off
his
army
toward
stockach
his
left
having
simply
shown
itself
returned
toward
the
center
by
fribourg
in
brisgau
in
napoleon
while
master
of
vienna
detached
the
corps
of
bernadotte
to
iglau
to
overawe
bohemia
and
paralyze
the
archduke
ferdinand
who
was
assembling
an
army
in
that
territory
in
another
direction
he
sent
davoust
to
presburg
to
show
himself
in
hungary
but
he
withdrew
them
to
brunn
to
take
part
in
the
event
which
was
to
decide
the
issue
of
the
campaign
and
a
great
and
decisive
victory
was
the
result
of
his
wise
maneuvers
operations
of
this
kind
so
far
from
being
in
opposition
to
the
principles
of
the
art
of
war
are
necessary
to
facilitate
their
application
it
readily
appears
from
what
goes
before
that
precise
rules
can
not
be
laid
down
for
these
operations
so
varied
in
character
the
success
of
which
depends
on
so
many
minute
details
generals
should
run
the
risk
of
making
detachments
only
after
careful
consideration
and
observation
of
all
the
surrounding
circumstances
the
only
reasonable
rules
on
the
subject
are
these
send
out
as
few
detachments
as
possible
and
recall
thorn
immediately
when
their
duty
is
performed
the
inconveniences
necessarily
attending
them
may
be
made
as
few
as
practicable
by
giving
judicious
and
instructions
to
their
commanders
herein
lies
the
great
talent
of
a
good
chief
of
staff
one
of
the
means
of
avoiding
the
disastrous
results
to
which
detachments
sometimes
lead
is
to
neglect
none
of
the
precautions
prescribed
by
tactics
for
increasing
the
strength
of
any
force
by
posting
it
in
good
positions
but
it
is
generally
imprudent
to
engage
in
a
serious
conflict
with
too
large
a
body
of
troops
in
such
cases
ease
and
rapidity
of
motion
will
be
most
likely
to
insure
safety
it
seldom
happens
that
it
is
right
for
a
detachment
to
resolve
to
conquer
or
die
in
the
position
it
has
taken
whether
voluntarily
or
by
order
it
is
certain
that
in
all
possible
cases
the
rules
of
tactics
and
of
must
be
applied
by
detachments
as
well
as
by
the
army
itself
since
we
have
included
in
the
number
of
useful
cases
of
detachments
those
intended
for
de
it
is
proper
to
mention
a
few
examples
of
this
kind
to
enable
the
reader
to
judge
for
himself
we
may
call
to
mind
that
one
which
was
executed
by
the
russians
toward
the
end
of
with
the
view
of
taking
possession
of
sizeboli
in
the
gulf
of
bourghas
the
capture
of
this
gulf
which
the
russians
rapidly
strengthened
procured
for
them
in
case
of
success
an
essential
beyond
the
balkan
where
depots
could
be
established
in
advance
for
the
army
intending
to
cross
those
mountains
in
case
of
failure
no
one
was
compromised
not
even
the
small
corps
which
had
been
debarked
since
it
had
a
safe
and
certain
retreat
to
the
shipping
in
like
manner
in
the
campaign
of
the
de
attempted
by
the
austrians
for
the
purpose
of
taking
possession
of
kehl
and
destroying
the
bridge
whilst
moreau
was
returning
from
bavaria
would
have
had
very
important
consequences
if
it
had
not
failed
in
attempts
of
this
kind
a
little
is
risked
to
gain
a
great
deal
and
as
they
can
in
no
wise
compromise
the
safety
of
the
main
army
they
may
be
freely
recommended
small
bodies
of
troops
thrown
forward
into
the
zone
of
the
operations
belong
to
the
class
of
detachments
that
are
judicious
a
few
hundred
horsemen
thus
risked
will
be
no
great
loss
if
captured
and
they
may
be
the
means
of
causing
the
enemy
great
injury
the
small
detachments
sent
out
by
the
russians
in
and
were
a
great
hinderance
to
napoleon
operations
and
several
times
caused
his
plans
to
fail
by
intercepting
his
couriers
for
such
expeditions
officers
should
be
selected
who
are
bold
and
full
of
stratagems
they
ought
to
inflict
upon
the
enemy
all
the
injury
they
can
without
compromising
themselves
when
an
opportunity
of
striking
a
telling
blow
presents
itself
they
should
not
think
for
a
moment
of
any
dangers
or
difficulties
in
their
path
generally
however
address
and
presence
of
mind
which
will
lead
them
to
avoid
useless
danger
are
qualities
more
necessary
for
a
partisan
than
cool
calculating
boldness
for
further
information
on
this
subject
i
refer
my
readers
to

passage
of
rivers
and
other
streams
the
passage
of
a
small
stream
over
which
a
bridge
is
already
in
place
or
might
be
easily
constructed
presents
none
of
the
combinations
belonging
to
grand
tactics
or
strategy
but
the
passage
of
a
large
river
such
as
the
danube
the
rhine
the
po
the
elbe
the
oder
the
vistula
the
inn
the
ticino
c
is
an
operation
worthy
the
closest
study
the
art
of
building
military
bridges
is
a
special
branch
of
military
science
which
is
committed
to
pontoniers
or
sappers
it
is
not
from
this
point
of
view
that
i
propose
to
consider
the
passage
of
a
stream
but
as
the
attack
of
a
military
position
and
as
a
maneuver
the
passage
itself
is
a
tactical
operation
but
the
determination
of
the
point
of
passage
may
have
an
important
connection
with
all
the
operations
taking
place
within
the
entire
theater
of
the
war
the
passage
of
the
rhine
by
general
moreau
in
is
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
truth
of
this
remark
napoleon
a
more
skillful
strategist
than
moreau
desired
him
to
cross
at
schaffhausen
in
order
to
take
kray
whole
army
in
reverse
to
reach
ulm
before
him
to
cut
him
off
from
austria
and
hurl
him
back
upon
the
main
moreau
who
had
already
a
bridge
at
basel
preferred
passing
with
greater
convenience
to
his
army
in
front
of
the
enemy
to
turning
his
extreme
left
the
tactical
advantages
seemed
to
his
mind
much
more
sure
than
the
strategical
he
preferred
the
certainty
of
a
partial
success
to
the
risk
attending
a
victory
which
would
have
been
a
decisive
one
in
the
same
campaign
napoleon
passage
of
the
po
is
another
example
of
the
high
strategic
importance
of
the
choice
of
the
point
of
crossing
the
army
of
the
reserve
after
the
engagement
of
the
chiusella
could
either
march
by
the
left
bank
of
the
po
to
turin
or
cross
the
river
at
crescentino
and
march
directly
to
genoa
napoleon
preferred
to
cross
the
ticino
enter
milan
effect
a
junction
with
moncey
who
was
approaching
with
twenty
thousand
men
by
the
pass
then
to
cross
the
po
at
piacenza
expecting
to
get
before
mélas
more
certainly
in
that
direction
than
if
he
came
down
too
soon
upon
his
line
of
retreat
the
passage
of
the
danube
at
donauwerth
and
ingolstadt
in
was
a
very
similar
operation
the
direction
chosen
for
the
passage
was
the
prime
cause
of
the
destruction
of
mack
army
the
proper
strategic
point
of
passage
is
easily
determined
by
recollecting
the
principles
laid
down
in
article
xix
and
it
is
here
only
necessary
to
remind
the
reader
that
in
crossing
a
river
as
in
every
other
operation
there
are
permanent
or
geographical
decisive
points
and
others
which
are
relative
or
eventual
depending
on
the
distribution
of
the
hostile
forces
if
the
point
selected
combines
strategic
advantages
with
the
tactical
no
other
point
can
be
better
but
if
the
locality
presents
obstacles
exceedingly
difficult
to
pass
another
must
be
chosen
and
in
making
the
new
selection
care
should
be
taken
to
have
the
direction
of
the
movement
as
nearly
as
possible
coincident
with
the
true
strategic
direction
independently
of
the
general
combinations
which
exercise
a
great
influence
in
fixing
the
point
of
passage
there
is
still
another
consideration
connected
with
the
locality
itself
the
best
position
is
that
where
the
army
after
crossing
can
take
its
front
of
operations
and
line
of
battle
perpendicular
to
the
river
at
least
for
the
first
marches
without
being
forced
to
separate
into
several
corps
moving
upon
different
lines
this
advantage
will
also
save
it
the
danger
of
fighting
a
battle
with
a
river
in
rear
as
happened
to
napoleon
at
essling
enough
has
been
said
with
reference
to
the
strategical
considerations
influencing
the
selection
of
the
point
of
crossing
a
river
we
will
now
proceed
to
speak
of
the
passage
itself
history
is
the
best
school
in
which
to
study
the
measures
likely
to
insure
the
success
of
such
operations
the
ancients
deemed
the
passage
of
the
granicus
which
is
a
small
stream
a
wonderful
exploit
so
far
as
this
point
is
concerned
the
people
of
modern
days
can
cite
much
greater
the
passage
of
the
rhine
at
tholhuys
by
louis
xiv
has
been
greatly
lauded
and
it
was
really
remarkable
in
our
own
time
general
dedon
has
made
famous
the
two
passages
of
the
rhine
at
kehl
and
of
the
danube
at
hochstadt
in
his
work
is
a
model
as
far
as
concerns
the
details
and
in
these
operations
minute
attention
to
details
is
every
thing
more
recently
three
other
passages
of
the
danube
and
the
passage
of
the
beresina
have
exceeded
every
thing
of
the
kind
previously
seen
the
two
first
were
executed
by
napoleon
at
essling
and
at
wagram
in
presence
of
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
provided
with
four
hundred
pieces
of
cannon
and
at
a
point
where
the
bed
of
the
stream
is
broadest
general
pelet
interesting
account
of
them
should
be
carefully
read
the
third
was
executed
by
the
russian
army
at
satounovo
in
which
although
not
to
be
compared
with
the
two
just
mentioned
was
very
remarkable
on
account
of
the
great
local
difficulties
and
the
vigorous
exertions
made
to
surmount
them
the
passage
of
the
beresina
was
truly
wonderful
my
object
not
being
to
give
historical
details
on
this
subject
i
direct
my
readers
to
the
special
narratives
of
these
events
i
will
give
several
general
rules
to
be
observed
it
is
essential
to
deceive
the
enemy
as
to
the
point
of
passage
that
he
may
not
accumulate
an
opposing
force
there
in
addition
to
the
strategic
demonstrations
false
attacks
must
be
made
near
the
real
one
to
divide
the
attention
and
means
of
the
enemy
for
this
purpose
half
of
the
artillery
should
be
employed
to
make
a
great
deal
of
noise
at
the
points
where
the
passage
is
not
to
be
made
whilst
perfect
silence
should
be
preserved
where
the
real
attempt
is
to
be
made
the
construction
of
the
bridge
should
be
covered
as
much
as
possible
by
troops
sent
over
in
boats
for
the
purpose
of
dislodging
the
enemy
who
might
interfere
with
the
progress
of
the
work
and
these
troops
should
take
possession
at
once
of
any
villages
woods
or
other
obstacles
in
the
vicinity
it
is
of
importance
also
to
arrange
large
batteries
of
heavy
caliber
not
only
to
sweep
the
opposite
bank
but
to
silence
any
artillery
the
enemy
might
bring
up
to
batter
the
bridge
while
building
for
this
purpose
it
is
convenient
to
have
the
bank
from
which
the
passage
is
made
somewhat
higher
than
the
other
the
proximity
of
a
large
island
near
the
enemy
bank
gives
great
facilities
for
passing
over
troops
in
boats
and
for
constructing
the
bridge
in
like
manner
a
smaller
stream
emptying
into
the
larger
near
the
point
of
passage
is
a
favorable
place
for
collecting
and
concealing
boats
and
materials
for
the
bridge
it
is
well
to
choose
a
position
where
the
river
makes
a
bend
as
the
batteries
on
the
assailant
side
can
cross
their
fire
in
front
of
the
point
where
the
troops
are
to
land
from
the
boats
and
where
the
end
of
the
bridge
is
to
rest
thus
taking
the
enemy
in
front
and
flank
when
he
attempts
to
oppose
the
passage
the
locality
selected
should
be
near
good
roads
on
both
banks
that
the
army
may
have
good
communications
to
the
front
and
rear
on
both
banks
of
the
river
for
this
reason
those
points
where
the
banks
are
high
and
steep
should
be
usually
avoided
the
rules
for
preventing
a
passage
follow
as
a
matter
of
course
from
those
for
effecting
it
as
the
duty
of
the
defenders
is
to
counteract
the
efforts
of
the
assailants
the
important
thing
is
to
have
the
course
of
the
river
watched
by
bodies
of
light
troops
without
attempting
to
make
a
defense
at
every
point
concentrate
rapidly
at
the
threatened
point
in
order
to
overwhelm
the
enemy
while
a
part
only
of
his
army
shall
have
passed
imitate
the
duke
of
vendôme
at
cassano
and
the
archduke
charles
at
essling
in
the
last
example
being
particularly
worthy
of
praise
although
the
operation
was
not
so
decidedly
successful
as
might
have
been
expected
in
article
xxi
attention
was
called
to
the
influence
that
the
passage
of
a
river
in
the
opening
of
a
campaign
may
have
in
giving
direction
to
the
lines
of
operations
we
will
now
see
what
connection
it
may
have
with
subsequent
strategic
movements
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
to
be
encountered
after
a
passage
is
to
cover
the
bridge
against
the
enemy
efforts
to
destroy
it
without
interfering
too
much
with
the
free
movement
of
the
army
when
the
army
is
numerically
very
superior
to
the
enemy
or
when
the
river
is
passed
just
after
a
great
victory
gained
the
difficulty
mentioned
is
trifling
but
when
the
campaign
is
just
opening
and
the
two
opposing
armies
are
about
equal
the
case
is
very
different
if
one
hundred
thousand
frenchmen
pass
the
rhine
at
strasbourg
or
at
manheim
in
presence
of
one
hundred
thousand
austrians
the
first
thing
to
be
done
will
be
to
drive
the
enemy
in
three
directions
first
before
them
as
far
as
the
black
forest
secondly
by
the
right
in
order
to
cover
the
bridges
on
the
upper
rhine
and
thirdly
by
the
left
to
cover
the
bridges
of
mayence
and
the
lower
rhine
this
necessity
is
the
cause
of
an
unfortunate
division
of
the
forces
but
to
make
the
inconveniences
of
this
subdivision
as
few
as
possible
the
idea
must
be
insisted
on
that
it
is
by
no
means
essential
for
the
army
to
be
separated
into
three
equal
parts
nor
need
these
detachments
remain
absent
longer
than
the
few
days
required
for
taking
possession
of
the
natural
point
of
concentration
of
the
enemy
forces
the
fact
can
not
be
concealed
however
that
the
case
supposed
is
one
in
which
the
general
finds
his
position
a
most
trying
one
for
if
he
divides
his
army
to
protect
his
bridges
he
may
be
obliged
to
contend
with
one
of
his
subdivisions
against
the
whole
of
the
enemy
force
and
have
it
overwhelmed
and
if
he
moves
his
army
upon
a
single
line
the
enemy
may
divide
his
army
and
reassemble
it
at
some
unexpected
point
the
bridges
may
be
captured
or
destroyed
and
the
general
may
find
himself
compromised
before
he
has
had
time
or
opportunity
to
gain
a
victory
the
best
course
to
be
pursued
is
to
place
the
bridges
near
a
city
which
will
afford
a
strong
defensive
point
for
their
protection
to
infuse
all
possible
vigor
and
activity
into
the
first
operations
after
the
passage
to
fall
upon
the
subdivisions
of
the
enemy
army
in
succession
and
to
beat
them
in
such
a
way
that
they
will
have
no
further
desire
of
touching
the
bridges
in
some
cases
eccentric
lines
of
operations
may
be
used
if
the
enemy
has
divided
his
one
hundred
thousand
men
into
several
corps
occupying
posts
of
observation
a
passage
may
be
effected
with
one
hundred
thousand
men
at
a
single
point
near
the
center
of
the
line
of
posts
the
isolated
defensive
corps
at
this
position
may
be
overwhelmed
and
two
masses
of
fifty
thousand
men
each
may
then
be
formed
which
by
taking
diverging
lines
of
operations
can
certainly
drive
off
the
successive
portions
of
the
opposing
army
prevent
them
from
reuniting
and
remove
them
farther
and
farther
from
the
bridges
but
if
on
the
contrary
the
passage
be
effected
at
one
extremity
of
the
enemy
strategic
front
by
moving
rapidly
along
this
front
the
enemy
may
be
beaten
throughout
its
whole
extent
in
the
same
manner
that
frederick
tactically
beat
the
austrian
line
at
leuthen
throughout
its
length
the
bridges
will
be
secure
in
rear
of
the
army
and
remain
protected
during
all
the
forward
movements
it
was
in
this
manner
that
jourdan
having
passed
the
rhine
at
dusseldorf
in
on
the
extreme
right
of
the
austrians
could
have
advanced
in
perfect
safety
toward
the
main
he
was
driven
away
because
the
french
having
a
double
and
exterior
line
of
operations
left
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
inactive
between
mayence
and
basel
while
clairfayt
repulsed
jourdan
upon
the
lahn
but
this
can
not
diminish
the
importance
of
the
advantages
gained
by
passing
a
river
upon
one
extremity
of
the
enemy
strategic
front
a
should
either
adopt
this

not
appear
out
of

here
since
their

with
the

been
the

point
under

it
sometimes
happens

for

reasons
a

is
attempted

a
single

of
operations

was
the

the
advantage
is
gained
of
having
in

a

is
the

in
thus
operating
on

always
lead

know

take
advantage
of

in

the
inconveniences
of

may
be
diminished
by
passing
over
the

then
becomes
the
decisive
one

by
concentrating
the

interior
lines
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
prevent
the

from
destroying
them

observed
this
rule
and
made
a
junction
of
their
forces
in

retreats
and
pursuits
retreats
are
certainly
the
most
difficult
operations
in
war
this
remark
is
so
true
that
the
celebrated
prince
de
ligne
said
in
his
usual
piquant
style
that
he
could
not
conceive
how
an
army
ever
succeeded
in
retreating
when
we
think
of
the
physical
and
moral
condition
of
an
army
in
full
retreat
after
a
lost
battle
of
the
difficulty
of
preserving
order
and
of
the
disasters
to
which
disorder
may
lead
it
is
not
hard
to
understand
why
the
most
experienced
generals
have
hesitated
to
attempt
such
an
operation
what
method
of
retreat
shall
be
recommended
shall
the
fight
be
continued
at
all
hazards
until
nightfall
and
the
retreat
executed
under
cover
of
the
darkness
or
is
it
better
not
to
wait
for
this
last
chance
but
to
abandon
the
field
of
battle
while
it
can
be
done
and
a
strong
opposition
still
made
to
the
pursuing
army
should
a
forced
march
be
made
in
the
night
in
order
to
get
as
much
start
of
the
enemy
as
possible
or
is
it
better
to
halt
after
a
and
make
a
show
of
fighting
again
each
of
these
methods
although
entirely
proper
in
certain
cases
might
in
others
prove
ruinous
to
the
whole
army
if
the
theory
of
war
leaves
any
points
unprovided
for
that
of
retreats
is
certainly
one
of
them
if
you
determine
to
fight
vigorously
until
night
you
may
expose
yourself
to
a
complete
defeat
before
that
time
arrives
and
if
a
forced
retreat
must
begin
when
the
shades
of
night
are
shrouding
every
thing
in
darkness
and
obscurity
how
can
you
prevent
the
disintegration
of
your
army
which
does
not
know
what
to
do
and
can
not
see
to
do
any
thing
properly
if
on
the
other
hand
the
field
of
battle
is
abandoned
in
broad
daylight
and
before
all
possible
efforts
have
been
made
to
hold
it
you
may
give
up
the
contest
at
the
very
moment
when
the
enemy
is
about
to
do
the
same
thing
and
this
fact
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
the
troops
you
may
lose
their
confidence
as
they
are
always
inclined
to
blame
a
prudent
general
who
retreats
before
the
necessity
for
so
doing
may
be
evident
to
themselves
moreover
who
can
say
that
a
retreat
commenced
in
the
daylight
in
presence
of
an
enterprising
enemy
may
not
become
a
rout
when
the
retreat
is
actually
begun
it
is
no
less
difficult
to
decide
whether
a
forced
march
shall
be
made
to
get
as
much
the
start
of
the
enemy
as
possible
since
this
hurried
movement
might
sometimes
cause
the
destruction
of
the
army
and
might
in
other
circumstances
be
its
salvation
all
that
can
be
positively
asserted
on
this
subject
is
that
in
general
with
an
army
of
considerable
magnitude
it
is
best
to
retreat
slowly
by
short
marches
with
a
of
sufficient
strength
to
hold
the
heads
of
the
enemy
columns
in
check
for
several
hours
retreats
are
of
different
kinds
depending
upon
the
cause
from
which
they
result
a
general
may
retire
of
his
own
accord
before
fighting
in
order
to
draw
his
adversary
to
a
position
which
he
prefers
to
his
present
one
this
is
rather
a
prudent
maneuver
than
a
retreat
it
was
thus
that
napoleon
retired
in
from
wischau
toward
brunn
to
draw
the
allies
to
a
point
which
suited
him
as
a
it
was
thus
that
wellington
retired
from
to
waterloo
this
is
what
i
proposed
to
do
before
the
attack
at
dresden
when
the
arrival
of
napoleon
was
known
i
represented
the
necessity
of
moving
toward
dippoldiswalde
to
choose
a
favorable
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
retreat
that
i
was
proposing
and
a
mistaken
idea
of
honor
prevented
a
retrograde
movement
without
fighting
which
would
have
been
the
means
of
avoiding
the
catastrophe
of
the
next
day
august
a
general
may
retire
in
order
to
hasten
to
the
defense
of
a
point
threatened
by
the
enemy
either
upon
the
flanks
or
upon
the
line
of
retreat
when
an
army
is
marching
at
a
distance
from
its
depots
in
an
exhausted
country
it
may
be
obliged
to
retire
in
order
to
get
nearer
its
supplies
finally
an
army
retires
involuntarily
after
a
lost
battle
or
after
an
unsuccessful
enterprise
these
are
not
the
only
causes
having
an
influence
in
retreats
their
character
will
vary
with
that
of
the
country
with
the
distances
to
be
passed
over
and
the
obstacles
to
be
surmounted
they
are
specially
dangerous
in
an
enemy
country
and
when
the
points
at
which
the
retreats
begin
are
distant
from
the
friendly
country
and
the
base
of
operations
they
become
painful
and
difficult
from
the
time
of
the
famous
retreat
of
the
ten
thousand
so
justly
celebrated
until
the
terrible
catastrophe
which
befell
the
french
army
in
history
does
not
make
mention
of
many
remarkable
retreats
that
of
antony
driven
out
of
media
was
more
painful
than
glorious
that
of
the
emperor
julian
harassed
by
the
same
parthians
was
a
disaster
in
more
recent
days
the
retreat
of
charles
viii
to
naples
when
he
passed
by
a
corps
of
the
italian
army
at
fornovo
was
an
admirable
one
the
retreat
of
de
bellisle
from
prague
does
not
deserve
the
praises
it
has
received
those
executed
by
the
king
of
prussia
after
raising
the
siege
of
olmutz
and
after
the
surprise
at
hochkirch
were
very
well
arranged
but
they
were
for
short
distances
that
of
moreau
in
which
was
magnified
in
importance
by
party
spirit
was
creditable
but
not
at
all
extraordinary
the
retreat
of
lecourbe
from
engadin
to
altorf
and
that
of
macdonald
by
pontremoli
after
the
defeat
of
the
trebbia
as
also
that
of
suwaroff
from
the
muttenthal
to
chur
were
glorious
feats
of
arms
but
partial
in
character
and
of
short
duration
the
retreat
of
the
russian
army
from
the
niemen
to
moscow
a
space
of
two
hundred
and
forty
leagues
in
presence
of
such
an
enemy
as
napoleon
and
such
cavalry
as
the
active
and
daring
murat
commanded
was
certainly
admirable
it
was
undoubtedly
attended
by
many
favorable
circumstances
but
was
highly
deserving
of
praise
not
only
for
the
talent
displayed
by
the
generals
who
directed
its
first
stages
but
also
for
the
admirable
fortitude
and
soldierly
bearing
of
the
troops
who
performed
it
although
the
retreat
from
moscow
was
a
bloody
catastrophe
for
napoleon
it
was
also
glorious
for
him
and
the
troops
who
were
at
krasnoi
and
the
beresina
because
the
skeleton
of
the
army
was
saved
when
not
a
single
man
should
have
returned
in
this
event
both
parties
covered
themselves
with
glory
the
magnitude
of
the
distances
and
the
nature
of
the
country
to
be
traversed
the
resources
it
offers
the
obstacles
to
be
encountered
the
attacks
to
be
apprehended
either
in
rear
or
in
flank
superiority
or
inferiority
in
cavalry
the
spirit
of
the
troops
are
circumstances
which
have
a
great
effect
in
deciding
the
fate
of
retreats
leaving
out
of
consideration
the
skillful
arrangements
which
the
generals
may
make
for
their
execution
a
general
falling
back
toward
his
native
land
along
his
line
of
magazines
and
supplies
may
keep
his
troops
together
and
in
good
order
and
may
effect
a
retreat
with
more
safety
than
one
compelled
to
subsist
his
army
in
cantonments
finding
it
necessary
to
occupy
an
extended
position
it
would
be
absurd
to
pretend
that
a
french
army
retiring
from
moscow
to
the
niemen
without
supplies
of
provisions
in
want
of
cavalry
and
draft
horses
could
effect
the
movement
in
the
same
good
order
and
with
the
same
steadiness
as
a
russian
army
well
provided
with
every
thing
necessary
marching
in
its
own
country
and
covered
by
an
immense
number
of
light
cavalry
there
are
five
methods
of
arranging
a
retreat
the
first
is
to
march
in
a
single
mass
and
upon
one
road
the
second
consists
in
dividing
the
army
into
two
or
three
corps
marching
at
the
distance
of
a
day
march
from
each
other
in
order
to
avoid
confusion
especially
in
the
the
third
consists
in
marching
upon
a
single
front
by
several
roads
nearly
parallel
and
having
a
common
point
of
arrival
the
fourth
consists
in
moving
by
constantly
converging
roads
the
fifth
on
the
contrary
consists
in
moving
along
diverging
roads
i
have
nothing
to
say
as
to
the
formation
of
but
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
a
good
one
should
always
be
prepared
and
well
sustained
by
a
portion
of
the
cavalry
reserves
this
arrangement
is
common
to
all
kinds
of
retreats
but
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
strategic
relations
of
these
operations
an
army
falling
back
in
good
order
with
the
intention
of
fighting
as
soon
as
it
shall
have
received
expected
reinforcements
or
as
soon
as
it
shall
have
reached
a
certain
strategic
position
should
prefer
the
first
method
as
this
particularly
insures
the
compactness
of
the
army
and
enables
it
to
be
in
readiness
for
battle
almost
at
any
moment
since
it
is
simply
necessary
to
halt
the
heads
of
columns
and
form
the
remainder
of
the
troops
under
their
protection
as
they
successively
arrive
an
army
employing
this
method
must
not
however
confine
itself
to
the
single
main
road
if
there
are
sufficiently
near
to
be
occupied
which
may
render
its
movements
more
rapid
and
secure
when
napoleon
retired
from
smolensk
he
used
the
second
method
having
the
portions
of
his
army
separated
by
an
entire
march
he
made
therein
a
great
mistake
because
the
enemy
was
not
following
upon
his
rear
but
moving
along
a
lateral
road
which
brought
him
in
a
nearly
perpendicular
direction
into
the
midst
of
the
separated
french
corps
the
three
fatal
days
of
krasnoi
were
the
result
the
employment
of
this
method
being
chiefly
to
avoid
incumbering
the
road
the
interval
between
the
departure
of
the
several
corps
is
sufficiently
great
when
the
artillery
may
readily
file
off
instead
of
separating
the
corps
by
a
whole
march
the
army
would
be
better
divided
into
two
masses
and
a
a
from
each
other
these
masses
moving
off
in
succession
with
an
interval
of
two
hours
between
the
departure
of
their
several
may
file
off
without
incumbering
the
road
at
least
in
ordinary
countries
in
crossing
the
or
the
balkan
other
calculations
would
doubtless
be
necessary
i
apply
this
idea
to
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
or
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
having
a
of
twenty
thousand
or
thousand
men
distant
about
a
in
rear
the
army
may
be
divided
into
two
masses
of
about
sixty
thousand
men
each
encamped
at
a
distance
of
three
or
four
leagues
from
each
other
each
of
these
masses
will
be
subdivided
into
two
or
three
corps
which
may
either
move
successively
along
the
road
or
form
in
two
lines
across
the
road
in
either
case
if
one
corps
of
thirty
thousand
men
moves
at
five
and
the
other
at
seven
there
will
be
no
danger
of
interference
with
each
other
unless
something
unusual
should
happen
for
the
second
mass
being
at
the
same
hours
of
the
day
about
four
leagues
behind
the
first
they
can
never
be
occupying
the
same
part
of
the
road
at
the
same
time
when
there
are
practicable
roads
in
the
neighborhood
suitable
at
least
for
infantry
and
cavalry
the
intervals
may
be
diminished
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
such
an
order
of
march
can
only
be
used
when
provisions
are
plentiful
and
the
third
method
is
usually
the
best
because
the
army
is
then
marching
in
in
long
days
and
in
hot
countries
the
best
times
for
marching
are
the
night
and
the
early
part
of
the
day
it
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
problems
of
logistics
to
make
suitable
arrangements
of
hours
of
departures
and
halts
for
armies
and
this
is
particularly
the
case
in
retreats
many
generals
neglect
to
arrange
the
manner
and
times
of
halts
and
great
disorder
on
the
march
is
the
consequence
as
each
brigade
or
division
takes
the
responsibility
of
halting
whenever
the
soldiers
are
a
little
tired
and
find
it
agreeable
to
bivouac
the
larger
the
army
and
the
more
compactly
it
marches
the
more
important
does
it
become
to
arrange
well
the
hours
of
departures
and
halts
especially
if
the
army
is
to
move
at
night
an
halt
of
part
of
a
column
may
cause
as
much
mischief
as
a
rout
if
the
is
closely
pressed
the
army
should
halt
in
order
to
relieve
it
by
a
fresh
corps
taken
from
the
second
mass
which
will
halt
with
this
object
in
view
the
enemy
seeing
eighty
thousand
men
in
will
think
it
necessary
to
halt
and
collect
his
columns
and
then
the
retreat
should
recommence
at
nightfall
to
regain
the
space
which
has
been
lost
the
third
method
of
retreating
along
several
parallel
roads
is
excellent
when
the
roads
are
sufficiently
near
each
other
but
if
they
are
quite
distant
one
wing
separated
from
the
center
and
from
the
other
wing
may
be
compromised
if
the
enemy
attacks
it
in
force
and
compels
it
to
stand
on
the
defensive
the
prussian
army
moving
from
magdeburg
toward
the
oder
in
gives
an
example
of
this
kind
the
fourth
method
which
consists
in
following
concentric
roads
is
undoubtedly
the
best
if
the
troops
are
distant
from
each
other
when
the
retreat
is
ordered
nothing
can
be
better
in
such
a
case
than
to
unite
the
forces
and
the
concentric
retreat
is
the
only
method
of
effecting
this
the
fifth
method
indicated
is
nothing
else
than
the
famous
system
of
eccentric
lines
which
i
have
attributed
to
bulow
and
have
opposed
so
warmly
in
the
earlier
editions
of
my
works
because
i
thought
i
could
not
be
mistaken
either
as
to
the
sense
of
his
remarks
on
the
subject
or
as
to
the
object
of
his
system
i
gathered
from
his
definition
that
he
recommended
to
a
retreating
army
moving
from
any
given
position
to
separate
into
parts
and
pursue
diverging
roads
with
the
double
object
of
withdrawing
more
readily
from
the
enemy
in
pursuit
and
of
arresting
his
march
by
threatening
his
flanks
and
his
line
of
communications
i
found
great
fault
with
the
system
for
the
simple
reason
that
a
beaten
army
is
already
weak
enough
without
absurdly
still
further
dividing
its
forces
and
strength
in
presence
of
a
victorious
enemy
bulow
has
found
defenders
who
declare
that
i
mistake
his
meaning
and
that
by
the
term
he
did
not
understand
a
retreat
made
on
several
diverging
roads
but
one
which
instead
of
being
directed
toward
the
center
of
the
base
of
operations
or
the
center
of
the
country
should
be
eccentric
to
that
focus
of
operations
and
along
the
line
of
the
frontier
of
the
country
i
may
possibly
have
taken
an
incorrect
impression
from
his
language
and
in
this
case
my
criticism
falls
to
the
ground
for
i
have
strongly
recommended
that
kind
of
a
retreat
to
which
i
have
given
the
name
of
the
parallel
retreat
it
is
my
opinion
that
an
army
leaving
the
line
which
leads
from
the
frontiers
to
the
center
of
the
state
with
a
view
of
moving
to
the
right
or
the
left
may
very
well
pursue
a
course
nearly
parallel
to
the
line
of
the
frontiers
or
to
its
front
of
operations
and
its
base
it
seems
to
me
more
rational
to
give
the
name
of
parallel
retreat
to
such
a
movement
as
that
described
designating
as
eccentric
retreat
that
where
diverging
roads
are
followed
all
leading
from
the
strategic
front
however
this
dispute
about
words
may
result
the
sole
cause
of
which
was
the
obscurity
of
bulow
text
i
find
fault
only
with
those
retreats
made
along
several
diverging
roads
under
pretense
of
covering
a
greater
extent
of
frontier
and
of
threatening
the
enemy
on
both
flanks
by
using
these
words
an
air
of
importance
may
be
given
to
systems
entirely
at
variance
with
the
principles
of
the
art
an
army
in
retreat
is
always
in
a
bad
state
either
physically
or
morally
because
a
retreat
can
only
be
the
result
of
reverses
or
of
numerical
inferiority
shall
such
an
army
be
still
more
weakened
by
dividing
it
i
find
no
fault
with
retreats
executed
in
several
columns
to
increase
the
ease
of
moving
when
these
columns
can
support
each
other
but
i
am
speaking
of
those
made
along
diverging
lines
of
operations
suppose
an
army
of
forty
thousand
men
retreating
before
another
of
sixty
thousand
if
the
first
forms
four
isolated
divisions
of
about
ten
thousand
men
the
enemy
may
maneuver
with
two
masses
of
thirty
thousand
men
each
can
he
not
turn
his
adversary
surround
disperse
and
ruin
in
succession
all
his
divisions
how
can
they
escape
such
a
fate
this
being
in
direct
opposition
to
a
divergent
system
the
latter
falls
of
itself
i
invoke
to
my
support
the
great
lessons
of
experience
when
the
leading
divisions
of
the
army
of
italy
were
repulsed
by
wurmser
bonaparte
collected
them
all
together
at
roverbella
and
although
he
had
only
forty
thousand
men
he
fought
and
beat
sixty
thousand
because
he
had
only
to
contend
against
isolated
columns
if
he
had
made
a
divergent
retreat
what
would
have
become
of
his
army
and
his
victories
wurmser
after
his
first
check
made
an
eccentric
retreat
directing
his
two
wings
toward
the
extremities
of
the
line
of
defense
what
was
the
result
his
right
although
supported
by
the
mountains
of
the
tyrol
was
beaten
at
trent
bonaparte
then
fell
upon
the
rear
of
his
left
and
destroyed
that
at
bassano
and
mantua
when
the
archduke
charles
gave
way
before
the
first
efforts
of
the
french
armies
in
would
he
have
saved
germany
by
an
eccentric
movement
was
not
the
salvation
of
germany
due
to
his
concentric
retreat
at
last
moreau
who
had
moved
with
a
very
extended
line
of
isolated
divisions
perceived
that
this
was
an
excellent
system
for
his
own
destruction
if
he
stood
his
ground
and
fought
or
adopted
the
alternative
of
retreating
he
concentrated
his
scattered
troops
and
all
the
efforts
of
the
enemy
were
fruitless
in
presence
of
a
mass
which
it
was
necessary
to
watch
throughout
the
whole
length
of
a
line
of
two
hundred
miles
such
examples
must
put
an
end
to
further
discussion
there
are
two
cases
in
which
divergent
retreats
are
admissible
and
then
only
as
a
last
resource
first
when
an
army
has
experienced
a
great
defeat
in
its
own
country
and
the
scattered
fragments
seek
protection
within
the
walls
of
fortified
places
secondly
in
a
war
where
the
sympathies
of
the
whole
population
are
enlisted
each
fraction
of
the
army
thus
divided
may
serve
as
a
nucleus
of
assembly
in
each
province
but
in
a
purely
methodical
war
with
regular
armies
carried
on
according
to
the
principles
of
the
art
divergent
retreats
are
simply
absurd
there
is
still
another
strategical
consideration
as
to
the
direction
of
a
retreat
to
decide
when
it
should
be
made
perpendicularly
to
the
frontier
and
toward
the
interior
of
the
country
or
when
it
should
be
parallel
to
the
frontier
for
example
when
marshal
soult
gave
up
the
line
of
the
pyrenees
in
he
had
to
choose
one
of
two
directions
for
his
retreat
either
by
way
of
bordeaux
toward
the
interior
of
france
or
by
way
of
toulouse
parallel
to
the
frontier
formed
by
the
pyrenees
in
the
same
way
when
frederick
retired
from
moravia
he
marched
toward
bohemia
instead
of
returning
to
silesia
these
parallel
retreats
are
often
to
be
preferred
for
the
reason
that
they
divert
the
enemy
from
a
march
upon
the
capital
of
the
state
and
the
center
of
its
power
the
propriety
of
giving
such
a
direction
to
a
retreat
must
be
determined
by
the
configuration
of
the
frontiers
the
positions
of
the
fortresses
the
greater
or
less
space
the
army
may
have
for
its
marches
and
the
facilities
for
recovering
its
direct
communications
with
the
central
portions
of
the
state
spain
is
admirably
suited
to
the
use
of
this
system
if
a
french
army
penetrates
by
way
of
bayonne
the
spaniards
may
base
themselves
upon
pampeluna
and
saragossa
or
upon
leon
and
the
asturias
and
in
either
case
the
french
can
not
move
directly
to
madrid
because
their
line
of
operations
would
be
at
the
mercy
of
their
adversary
the
frontier
of
the
turkish
empire
on
the
danube
presents
the
same
advantages
if
the
turks
knew
how
to
profit
by
them
in
france
also
the
parallel
retreat
may
be
used
especially
when
the
nation
itself
is
not
divided
into
two
political
parties
each
of
which
is
striving
for
the
possession
of
the
capital
if
the
hostile
army
penetrates
through
the
alps
the
french
can
act
on
the
rhone
and
the
saône
passing
around
the
frontier
as
far
as
the
moselle
on
one
side
or
as
far
as
provence
on
the
other
if
the
enemy
enters
the
country
by
way
of
strasbourg
mayence
or
valenciennes
the
same
thing
can
be
done
the
occupation
of
paris
by
the
enemy
would
be
impossible
or
at
least
very
hazardous
so
long
as
a
french
army
remained
in
good
condition
and
based
upon
its
circle
of
fortified
towns
the
same
is
the
case
for
all
countries
having
double
fronts
of
operations
austria
is
perhaps
not
so
fortunately
situated
on
account
of
the
directions
of
the
rhetian
and
tyrolean
alps
and
of
the
river
danube
lloyd
however
considers
bohemia
and
the
tyrol
as
two
bastions
connected
by
the
strong
curtain
of
the
river
inn
and
regards
this
frontier
as
exceedingly
well
suited
for
parallel
movements
this
assertion
was
not
well
sustained
by
the
events
of
the
campaigns
of
and
but
as
the
parallel
method
has
not
yet
had
a
fair
trial
on
that
ground
the
question
is
still
an
open
one
it
seems
to
me
that
the
propriety
of
applying
the
parallel
method
depends
mainly
upon
the
existing
and
the
antecedent
circumstances
of
each
case
if
a
french
army
should
approach
from
the
rhine
by
way
of
bavaria
and
should
find
allies
in
force
upon
the
lech
and
the
iser
it
would
be
a
very
delicate
operation
to
throw
the
whole
austrian
army
into
the
tyrol
and
into
bohemia
with
the
expectation
of
arresting
in
this
way
the
forward
movement
to
vienna
if
half
the
austrian
army
is
left
upon
the
inn
to
cover
the
approaches
to
the
capital
an
unfortunate
division
of
force
is
the
consequence
and
if
it
is
decided
to
throw
the
whole
army
into
the
tyrol
leaving
the
way
to
vienna
open
there
would
be
great
danger
incurred
if
the
enemy
is
at
all
enterprising
in
italy
beyond
the
mincio
the
parallel
method
would
be
of
difficult
application
on
the
side
of
the
tyrol
as
well
as
in
bohemia
against
an
enemy
approaching
from
saxony
for
the
reason
that
the
theater
of
operations
would
be
too
contracted
in
prussia
the
parallel
retreat
may
be
used
with
great
advantage
against
an
army
debouching
from
bohemia
upon
the
elbe
or
the
oder
whilst
its
employment
would
be
impossible
against
a
french
army
moving
from
the
rhine
or
a
russian
army
from
the
vistula
unless
prussia
and
austria
were
allies
this
is
a
result
of
the
geographical
configuration
of
the
country
which
allows
and
even
favors
lateral
movements
in
the
direction
of
its
greatest
dimension
from
memel
to
mayence
but
such
a
movement
would
be
disastrous
if
made
from
dresden
to
stettin
when
an
army
retreats
whatever
may
be
the
motive
of
the
operation
a
pursuit
always
follows
a
retreat
even
when
executed
in
the
most
skillful
manner
and
by
an
army
in
good
condition
always
gives
an
advantage
to
the
pursuing
army
and
this
is
particularly
the
case
after
a
defeat
and
when
the
source
of
supplies
and
reinforcements
is
at
a
great
distance
for
a
retreat
then
becomes
more
difficult
than
any
other
operation
in
war
and
its
difficulties
increase
in
proportion
to
the
skill
exhibited
by
the
enemy
in
conducting
the
pursuit
the
boldness
and
activity
of
the
pursuit
will
depend
of
course
upon
the
character
of
the
commanders
and
upon
the
and
of
the
two
armies
it
is
difficult
to
prescribe
fixed
rules
for
all
cases
of
pursuits
but
the
following
points
must
be
recollected
it
is
generally
better
to
direct
the
pursuit
upon
the
flank
of
the
retreating
columns
especially
when
it
is
made
in
one
own
country
and
where
no
danger
is
incurred
in
moving
perpendicularly
or
diagonally
upon
the
enemy
line
of
operations
care
must
however
be
taken
not
to
make
too
large
a
circuit
for
there
might
then
be
danger
of
losing
the
retreating
enemy
entirely
a
pursuit
should
generally
be
as
boldly
and
actively
executed
as
possible
especially
when
it
is
subsequent
to
a
battle
gained
because
the
demoralized
army
may
be
wholly
dispersed
if
vigorously
followed
up
there
are
very
few
cases
where
it
is
wise
to
make
a
bridge
of
gold
for
the
enemy
no
matter
what
the
old
roman
proverb
may
say
for
it
can
scarcely
ever
be
desirable
to
pay
an
enemy
to
leave
a
country
unless
in
the
case
when
an
unexpected
success
shall
have
been
gained
over
him
by
an
army
much
inferior
to
his
in
numbers
nothing
further
of
importance
can
be
added
to
what
has
been
said
on
the
subject
of
retreats
as
far
as
they
are
connected
with
grand
combinations
of
strategy
we
may
profitably
indicate
several
tactical
measures
which
may
render
them
more
easy
of
execution
one
of
the
surest
means
of
making
a
retreat
successfully
is
to
familiarize
the
officers
and
soldiers
with
the
idea
that
an
enemy
may
be
resisted
quite
as
well
when
coming
on
the
rear
as
on
the
front
and
that
the
preservation
of
order
is
the
only
means
of
saving
a
body
of
troops
harassed
by
the
enemy
during
a
retrograde
movement
rigid
discipline
is
at
all
times
the
best
preservative
of
good
order
but
it
is
of
special
importance
during
a
retreat
to
enforce
discipline
subsistence
must
be
furnished
that
the
troops
may
not
be
obliged
to
straggle
off
for
the
purpose
of
getting
supplies
by
marauding
it
is
a
good
plan
to
give
the
command
of
the
to
an
officer
of
great
coolness
and
to
attach
to
it
staff
officers
who
may
in
advance
of
its
movements
examine
and
select
points
suitable
for
occupation
to
hold
the
enemy
temporarily
in
check
cavalry
can
rally
so
rapidly
on
the
main
body
that
it
is
evidently
desirable
to
have
considerable
bodies
of
such
troops
as
they
greatly
facilitate
the
execution
of
a
slow
and
methodical
retreat
and
furnish
the
means
of
thoroughly
examining
the
road
itself
and
the
neighborhood
so
as
to
prevent
an
unexpected
onset
of
the
enemy
upon
the
flanks
of
the
retreating
columns
it
is
generally
sufficient
if
the
keep
the
enemy
at
the
distance
of
half
a
day
march
from
the
main
body
the
would
run
great
risk
of
being
itself
cut
off
if
farther
distant
when
however
there
are
defiles
in
its
rear
which
are
held
by
friends
it
may
increase
the
sphere
of
its
operations
and
remain
a
full
day
march
to
the
rear
for
a
defile
when
held
facilitates
a
retreat
in
the
same
degree
that
it
renders
it
more
difficult
if
in
the
power
of
the
enemy
if
the
army
is
very
numerous
and
the
proportionally
large
it
may
remain
a
day
march
in
rear
this
will
depend
however
upon
its
strength
the
nature
of
the
country
and
the
character
and
strength
of
the
pursuing
force
if
the
enemy
presses
up
closely
it
is
of
importance
not
to
permit
him
to
do
so
with
impunity
especially
if
the
retreat
is
made
in
good
order
in
such
a
case
it
is
a
good
plan
to
halt
from
time
to
time
and
fall
unexpectedly
upon
the
enemy
advanced
guard
as
the
archduke
charles
did
in
at
neresheim
moreau
at
biberach
and
kleber
at
ukerath
such
a
maneuver
almost
always
succeeds
on
account
of
the
surprise
occasioned
by
an
unexpected
offensive
return
upon
a
body
of
troops
which
is
thinking
of
little
else
than
collecting
trophies
and
spoils
passages
of
rivers
in
retreat
are
also
operations
by
no
means
devoid
of
interest
if
the
stream
is
narrow
and
there
are
permanent
bridges
over
it
the
operation
is
nothing
more
than
the
passage
of
a
defile
but
when
the
river
is
wide
and
is
to
be
crossed
upon
a
temporary
military
bridge
it
is
a
maneuver
of
extreme
delicacy
among
the
precautions
to
be
taken
a
very
important
one
is
to
get
the
parks
well
advanced
so
that
they
may
be
out
of
the
way
of
the
army
for
this
purpose
it
is
well
for
the
army
to
halt
a
march
from
the
river
the
should
also
keep
at
more
than
the
usual
distance
from
the
main
body
as
far
in
fact
as
the
locality
and
the
respective
forces
opposed
will
permit
the
army
may
thus
file
across
the
bridge
without
being
too
much
hurried
the
march
of
the
should
be
so
arranged
that
it
shall
have
reached
a
position
in
front
of
the
bridge
just
as
the
last
of
the
main
body
has
passed
this
will
be
a
suitable
moment
for
relieving
the
by
fresh
troops
strongly
posted
the
will
pass
through
the
intervals
of
the
fresh
troops
in
position
and
will
cross
the
river
the
enemy
coming
up
and
finding
fresh
troops
drawn
up
to
give
him
battle
will
make
no
attempt
to
press
them
too
closely
the
new
will
hold
its
position
until
night
and
will
then
cross
the
river
breaking
the
bridges
after
it
it
is
of
course
understood
that
as
fast
as
the
troops
pass
they
form
on
the
opposite
bank
and
plant
batteries
so
as
to
protect
the
corps
left
to
hold
the
enemy
in
check
the
dangers
of
such
a
passage
in
retreat
and
the
nature
of
the
precautions
which
facilitate
it
indicate
that
measures
should
always
be
taken
to
throw
up
intrenchments
at
the
point
where
the
bridge
is
to
be
constructed
and
the
passage
made
where
time
is
not
allowed
for
the
construction
of
a
regular
de
a
few
redoubts
will
be
found
of
great
value
in
covering
the
retreat
of
the
last
troops
if
the
passage
of
a
large
river
is
so
difficult
when
the
enemy
is
only
pressing
on
the
rear
of
the
column
it
is
far
more
so
when
the
army
is
threatened
both
in
front
and
rear
and
the

treat
it
very

to
maintain
an

in

actively

difficult

may

abound

for

and
in

to
put

into

formerly
it
was
usual
for
each
party
to
go
into
winter
quarters
at
the
end
of
october
and
all
the
fighting
after
that
time
was
of
a
partisan
character

on
by
the

the
best
method
of
conducting
such
an
enterprise
and
the
precautions
to
be
taken
on
the
other
side
to
prevent
its
success
the
best
rules
to
be
laid
down
on
this
subject
seem
to
me
to
be
the
following
establish
the
cantonments
very
compactly
and
connectedly
and
occupying
a
space
as
broad
as
long
in
order
to
avoid
having
a
too
extended
line
of
troops
which
is
always
easily
broken
through
and
can
not
be
concentrated
in
time
cover
them
by
a
river
or
by
an
outer
line
of
troops
in
huts
and
with
their
position
strengthened
by
fix
upon
points
of
assembly
which
may
be
reached
by
all
the
troops
before
the
enemy
can
penetrate
so
far
keep
all
the
avenues
by
which
an
enemy
may
approach
constantly
patrolled
by
bodies
of
cavalry
finally
establish
signals
to
give
warning
if
an
attack
is
made
at
any
point
in
the
winter
of
napoleon
established
his
army
in
cantonments
behind
the
passarge
in
face
of
the
enemy
the
advanced
guard
alone
being
hutted
near
the
cities
of
gutstadt
osterode
the
army
numbered
more
than
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
and
much
skill
was
requisite
in
feeding
it
and
keeping
it
otherwise
comfortable
in
this
position
until
june
the
country
was
of
a
favorable
character
but
this
can
not
be
expected
to
be
the
case
everywhere
an
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
may
find
it
not
very
difficult
to
have
a
compact
and
system
of
winter
quarters
in
countries
where
large
towns
are
numerous
the
difficulty
increases
with
the
size
of
the
army
it
must
be
observed
however
that
if
the
extent
of
country
occupied
increases
in
proportion
to
the
numbers
in
the
army
the
means
of
opposing
an
irruption
of
the
enemy
increase
in
the
same
proportion
the
important
point
is
to
be
able
to
assemble
fifty
thousand
or
sixty
thousand
men
in
hours
with
such
an
army
in
hand
and
with
the
certainty
of
having
it
rapidly
increased
the
enemy
may
be
held
in
check
no
matter
how
strong
he
may
be
until
the
whole
army
is
assembled
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
there
will
always
be
a
risk
in
going
into
winter
quarters
if
the
enemy
keeps
his
army
in
a
body
and
seems
inclined
to
make
offensive
movements
and
the
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
this
fact
is
that
the
only
method
of
giving
secure
repose
to
an
army
in
winter
or
in
the
midst
of
a
campaign
is
to
establish
it
in
quarters
protected
by
a
river
or
to
arrange
an
armistice
in
the
strategic
positions
taken
up
by
an
army
in
the
course
of
a
campaign
whether
marching
or
acting
as
an
army
of
observation
or
waiting
for
a
favorable
opportunity
of
taking
the
offensive
it
will
probably
occupy
quite
compact
cantonments
the
selection
of
such
positions
requires
great
experience
upon
the
part
of
a
general
in
order
that
he
may
form
correct
conclusions
as
to
what
he
may
expect
the
enemy
to
do
an
army
should
occupy
space
enough
to
enable
it
to
subsist
readily
and
it
should
also
keep
as
much
concentrated
as
possible
to
be
ready
for
the
enemy
should
he
show
himself
and
these
two
conditions
are
by
no
means
easily
reconciled
there
is
no
better
arrangement
than
to
place
the
divisions
of
the
army
in
a
space
nearly
a
square
so
that
in
case
of
need
the
whole
may
be
assembled
at
any
point
where
the
enemy
may
present
himself
nine
divisions
placed
in
this
way
a
march
from
each
other
may
in
twelve
hours
assemble

be
observed

descents
these
are
operations
of
rare
occurrence
and
may
be
classed
as
among
the
most
difficult
in
war
when
effected
in
presence
of
a
enemy
since
the
invention
of
gunpowder
and
the
changes
effected
by
it
in
navies
transports
are
so
helpless
in
presence
of
the
monstrous
of
the
present
day
armed
as
they
are
with
a
hundred
cannon
that
an
army
can
make
a
descent
only
with
the
assistance
of
a
numerous
fleet
of
ships
of
war
which
can
command
the
sea
at
least
until
the
debarkation
of
the
army
takes
place
before
the
invention
of
gunpowder
the
transports
were
also
the
ships
of
war
they
were
moved
along
at
pleasure
by
using
oars
were
light
and
could
skirt
along
the
coasts
their
number
was
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
troops
to
be
embarked
and
aside
from
the
danger
of
tempests
the
operations
of
a
fleet
could
be
arranged
with
almost
as
much
certainty
as
those
of
an
army
on

ancient
history
for
these
reasons
gives
us
examples
of
more
extensive
debarkations
than
modern
times

does
not
recall
to

the
immense
forces
transported
by
the

innumerable

the

by

prevent
descents
with
thirty

forty

it

extremely
difficult
to
find
transportation
for
one
hundred
or
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
with
their
immense
trains
of
artillery

cavalry
we
were
however
on
the
point
of
seeing
the
solution
of
the
vast
problem
of
the
practicability
of
descents
in
great
force
if
it
is
true
that
napoleon
seriously
contemplated
the
transportation
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
veterans
from
boulogne
to
the
british
isles
unfortunately
his
failure
to
execute
this
gigantic
undertaking
has
left
us
entirely
in
the
dark
as
to
this
grave
question
it
is
not
impossible
to
collect
fifty
french
in
the
channel
by
misleading
the
english
this
was
in
fact
upon
the
point
of
being
done
it
is
then
no
longer
impossible
with
a
favorable
wind
to
pass
over
the
flotilla
in
two
days
and
effect
a
landing
but
what
would
become
of
the
army
if
a
storm
should
disperse
the
fleet
of
ships
of
war
and
the
english
should
return
in
force
to
the
channel
and
defeat
the
fleet
or
oblige
it
to
regain
its
ports
posterity
will
regret
as
the
loss
of
an
example
to
all
future
generations
that
this
immense
undertaking
was
not
carried
through
or
at

attempted
doubtless
many
brave
men
would
have
met
their
deaths
but
were
not
those
men
mowed
down
more
uselessly
on
the
plains
of

and
of

in
the

and
the

of

what
man
would
not
glory
in
assisting
to
bring
to
a
conclusion
the
greatest
trial
of
skill
and
strength
ever
seen
between
two
great
nations
at
any
rate
posterity
will
find
in
the
preparations
made
for
this
descent
one
of
the
most
valuable
lessons
the
present
century
has
furnished
for
the
study
of
soldiers
and
of
statesmen
the
labors
of
every
kind
performed
on
the
coasts
of
france
from
to
will
be
among
the
most
remarkable
monuments
of
the
activity
foresight
and
skill
of
napoleon
it
is
recommended
to
the
careful
attention
of
young
officers
but
while
admitting
the
possibility
of
success
for
a
great
descent
upon
a
coast
so
near
as
the
english
to
boulogne
what
results
should
be
expected
if
this
armada
had
had
a
long
to
make
how
could
so
many
small
vessels
be
kept
moving
even
for
two
days
and
nights
to
what
chances
of
ruin
would
not
so
many
frail
boats
be
exposed
in
navigating
the
open
seas
moreover
the
artillery
munitions
of
war
equipments
provisions
and
fresh
water
that
must
be
carried
with
this
multitude
of
men
require
immense
labor
in
preparation
and
vast
means
of
transportation
experience
has
shown
clearly
the
difficulties
attending
such
an
expedition
even
for
thirty
thousand
men
from
known
facts
it
is
evident
that
a
descent
can
be
made
with
this
number
of
men
in
four
cases
against
colonies
or
isolated
possessions
against
powers
which
can
not
be
immediately
supported
from
abroad
for
the
purpose
of
effecting
a
temporary
diversion
or
to
capture
a
position
which
it
is
important
to
hold
for
a
time
to
make
a
diversion
at
once
political
and
military
against
a
state
already
engaged
in
a
great
war
whose
troops
are
occupied
at
a
distance
from
the
point
of
the
descent
it
is
difficult
to
lay
down
rules
for
operations
of
this
character
about
the
only
recommendations
i
can
make
are
the
following
deceive
the
enemy
as
to
the
point
of
landing
choose
a
spot
where
the
vessels
may
anchor
in
safety
and
the
troops
be
landed
together
infuse
as
much
activity
as
possible
into
the
operation
and
take
possession
of
some
strong
point
to
cover
the
development
of
the
troops
as
they
land
put
on
shore
at
once
a
part
of
the
artillery
to
give
confidence
and
protection
to
the
troops
that
have
landed
a
great
difficulty
in
such
an
operation
is
found
in
the
fact
that
the
transports
can
never
get
near
the
beach
and
the
troops
must
be
landed
in
boats
and
rafts
which
takes
time
and
gives
the
enemy
great
advantages
if
the
sea
is
rough
the
men
to
be
landed
are
exposed
to
great
risks
for
what
can
a
body
of
infantry
do
crowded
in
boats
tossed
about
by
the
waves
and
ordinarily
rendered
unfit
by
for
the
proper
use
of
their
arms
i
can
only
advise
the
party
on
the
defensive
not
to
divide
his
forces
too
much
by
attempting
to
cover
every
point
it
is
an
impossibility
to
line
the
entire
coast
with
batteries
and
battalions
for
its
defense
but
the
approaches
to
those
places
where
large
establishments
are
to
be
protected
must
be
closed
signals
should
be
arranged
for
giving
prompt
notice
of
the
point
where
the
enemy
is
landing
and
all
the
disposable
force
should
be
rapidly
concentrated
there
to
prevent
his
gaining
a
firm
foothold
the
configuration
of
coasts
has
a
great
influence
upon
descents
and
their
prosecution
there
are
countries
where
the
coasts
are
steep
and
present
few
points
of
easy
access
for
the
ships
and
the
troops
to
be
landed
these
few
places
may
be
more
readily
watched
and
the
descent
becomes
more
difficult
finally
there
is
a
strategical
consideration
connected
with
descents
which
may
be
usefully
pointed
out
the
same
principle
which
forbids
a
continental
army
from
interposing
the
mass
of
its
forces
between
the
enemy
and
the
sea
requires
on
the
contrary
that
an
army
landing
upon
a
coast
should
always
keep
its
principal
mass
in
communication
with
the
shore
which
is
at
once
its
line
of
retreat
and
its
base
of
supplies
for
the
same
reason
its
first
care
should
be
to
make
sure
of
the
possession
of
one
fortified
or
at
least
of
a
tongue

logistics
or
the
practical
art
of
moving
armies
article
xli
a
few
remarks
on
logistics
in
general
is
logistics
simply
a
science
of
detail
or
on
the
contrary
is
it
a
general
science
forming
one
of
the
most
essential
parts
of
the
art
of
war
or
is
it
but
a
term
consecrated
by
long
use
intended
to
designate
collectively
the
different
branches
of
staff
duty
that
is
to
say
the
different
means
of
carrying
out
in
practice
the
theoretical
combinations
of
the
art
these
questions
will
seem
singular
to
those
persons
who
are
firmly
convinced
that
nothing
more
remains
to
be
said
about
the
art
of
war
and
believe
it
wrong
to
search
out
new
definitions
where
every
thing
seems
already
accurately
classified
for
my
own
part
i
am
persuaded
that
good
definitions
lead
to
clear
ideas
and
i
acknowledge
some
embarrassment
in
answering
these
questions
which
seem
so
simple
in
the
earlier
editions
of
this
work
i
followed
the
example
of
other
military
writers
and
called
by
the
name
of
the
details
of
staff
duties
which
are
the
subject
of
regulations
for
and
of
special
instructions
relating
to
the
corps
of
quartermasters
this
was
the
result
of
prejudices
consecrated
by
time
the
word
is
derived
as
we
know
from
the
title
of
the
général
des
translated
in
german
by
an
officer
whose
duty
it
formerly
was
to
lodge
and
camp
the
troops
to
give
direction
to
the
marches
of
columns
and
to
locate
them
upon
the
ground
logistics
was
then
quite
limited
but
when
war
began
to
be
waged
without
camps
movements
became
more
complicated
and
the
staff
officers
had
more
extended
functions
the
chief
of
staff
began
to
perform
the
duty
of
transmitting
the
conceptions
of
the
general
to
the
most
distant
points
of
the
theater
of
war
and
of
procuring
for
him
the
necessary
documents
for
arranging
plans
of
operations
the
chief
of
staff
was
called
to
the
assistance
of
the
general
in
arranging
his
plans
to
give
information
of
them
to
subordinates
in
orders
and
instructions
to
explain
them
and
to
supervise
their
execution
both
in
their
and
in
their
minute
details
his
duties
were
therefore
evidently
connected
with
all
the
operations
of
a
campaign
to
be
a
good
chief
of
staff
it
became
in
this
way
necessary
that
a
man
should
be
acquainted
with
all
the
various
branches
of
the
art
of
war
if
the
term
includes
all
this
the
two
works
of
the
archduke
charles
the
voluminous
treatises
of
guibert
bousmard
and
ternay
all
taken
together
would
hardly
give
even
an
incomplete
sketch
of
what
logistics
is
for
it
would
be
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
science
of
applying
all
possible
military
knowledge
it
appears
from
what
has
been
said
that
the
old
term
is
insufficient
to
designate
the
duties
of
staff
officers
and
that
the
real
duties
of
a
corps
of
such
officers
if
an
attempt
be
made
to
instruct
them
in
a
proper
manner
for
their
performance
should
be
accurately
prescribed
by
special
regulations
in
accordance
with
the
general
principles
of
the
art
governments
should
take
the
precaution
to
publish
regulations
which
should
define
all
the
duties
of
staff
officers
and
should
give
clear
and
accurate
instructions
as
to
the
best
methods
of
performing
these
duties
the
austrian
staff
formerly
had
such
a
code
of
regulations
for
their
government
but
it
was
somewhat
behind
the
times
and
was
better
adapted
to
the
old
methods
of
carrying
on
war
than
the
present
this
is
the
only
work
of
the
kind
i
have
seen
there
are
no
doubt
others
both
public
and
secret
but
i
have
no
knowledge
of
their
existence
several
generals
as
for
instance
grimoard
and
thiebaut
have
prepared
manuals
for
staff
officers
and
the
new
royal
corps
of
france
has
issued
several
partial
sets
of
instructions
but
there
is
nowhere
to
be
found
a
complete
manual
on
the
subject
if
it
is
agreed
that
the
old
had
reference
only
to
details
of
marches
and
camps
and
moreover
that
the
functions
of
staff
officers
at
the
present
day
are
intimately
connected
with
the
most
important
strategical
combinations
it
must
be
admitted
that
logistics
includes
but
a
small
part
of
the
duties
of
staff
officers
and
if
we
retain
the
term
we
must
understand
it
to
be
greatly
extended
and
developed
in
signification
so
as
to
embrace
not
only
the
duties
of
ordinary
staff
officers
but
of
to
convince
my
readers
of
this
fact
i
will
mention
the
principal
points
that
must
be
included
if
we
wish
to
embrace
in
one
view
every
duty
and
detail
relating
to
the
movements
of
armies
and
the
undertakings
resulting
from
such
movements
the
preparation
of
all
the
material
necessary
for
setting
the
army
in
motion
or
in
other
words
for
opening
the
campaign
drawing
up
orders
instructions
and
itineraries
for
the
assemblage
of
the
army
and
its
subsequent
launching
upon
its
theater
of
operations
drawing
up
in
a
proper
manner
the
orders
of
the
for
different
enterprises
as
well
as
plans
of
attack
in
expected
battles
arranging
with
the
chiefs
of
engineers
and
artillery
the
measures
to
be
taken
for
the
security
of

are
to
be

as

to
be
fortified
in

to
facilitate
the
operations
of
the
army

and
directing
reconnoissances
of
every
kind
and

in
this
way
and
by
using
spies
as
exact
information
as
possible
of
the
positions
and

of
the
enemy
taking
every
precaution
for
the
proper
execution

of
the
different

so
that

their
staff
officers
relative
to
the
different
methods
of
drawing
up
the
troops
in
columns
when
the
enemy
is
at
hand
as
well
as
their
formation
in
the
most
appropriate
manner
when
the
army
is
to
engage
in
battle
according
to
the
nature
of
the
ground
and
the
character
of

they
will
not

with

will
still
be

taking
precautionary
measures
for
preserving

posting
fresh

to

intelligent

to
examine
and
select
positions
where
the
may
advantageously
halt
engage
the

check
his
pursuit
and
thus
gain
time
making
provision
in

for

of

that
nothing
shall

and
that
they
shall
proceed
in
the
most
perfect
order

all
proper
precautions
to
insure
safety
in
cantonments
assigning
positions
to
the
different
corps
indicating
to
each
principal
division
of
the
army
a
place
of
assembly
in
case
of
alarm
taking
measures
to
see
that
all
orders
instructions
and
regulations
are
implicitly
observed
an
examination
of
this
long
list
which
might
easily
be
made
much
longer
by
entering
into
greater
detail
will
lead
every
reader
to
remark
that
these
are
the
duties
rather
of
the
than
of
staff
officers
this
truth
i
announced
some
time
ago
and
it
is
for
the
very
purpose
of
permitting
the
to
give
his
whole
attention
to
the
supreme
direction
of
the
operations
that
he
ought
to
be
provided
with
staff
officers
competent
to
relieve
him
of
details
of
execution
their
functions
are
therefore
necessarily
very
intimately
connected
and
woe
to
an
army
where
these
authorities
cease
to
act
in
concert
this
want
of
harmony
is
often
seen
first
because
generals
are
men
and
have
faults
and
secondly
because
in
every
army
there
are
found
individual
interests
and
pretensions
producing
rivalry
of
the
chiefs
of
staff
and
hindering
them
in
performing
their
duties
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
this
treatise
shall
contain
rules
for
the
guidance
of
staff
officers
in
all
the
details
of
their
multifarious
duties
for
in
the
first
place
every
different
nation
has
staff
officers
with
different
names
and
rounds
of
duties
so
that
i
should
be
obliged
to
write
new
rules
for
each
army
in
the
second
place
these
details
are
fully
entered
into
in
special
books
pertaining
to
these
subjects
i
will
therefore
content
myself
with
enlarging
a
little
upon
some
of
the
first
articles
enumerated
above
the
measures
to
be
taken
by
the
staff
officers
for
preparing
the
army
to
enter
upon
active
operations
in
the
field
include
all
those
which
are
likely
to
facilitate
the
success
of
the
first
plan
of
operations
they
should
as
a
matter
of
course
make
sure
by
frequent
inspections
that
the
of
all
the
arms
of
the
service
is
in
good
order
horses
carriages
caissons
teams
harness
shoes
should
be
carefully
examined
and
any
deficiencies
supplied
trains
of
artillery
if
they
are
to
move
ambulances
in
a
word
every
thing
which
conies
under
the
head
of
should
be
carefully
examined
and
placed
in
good
order
if
the
campaign
is
to
be
opened
in
the
neighborhood
of
great
rivers
and
flying
bridges
should
be
prepared
and
all
the
small
craft
should
be
collected
at
the
points
and
at
the
bank
where
they
will
probably
be
used
intelligent
officers
should
examine
the
most
favorable
points
both
for
embarkations
and
for
landings
preferring
those
localities
which
present
the
greatest
chances
of
success
for
a
primary
establishment
on
the
opposite
bank
the
staff
officers
will
prepare
all
the
itineraries
that
will
be
necessary
for
the
movement
of
the
several
corps
of
the
army
to
the
proper
points
of
assemblage
making
every
effort
to
give
such
direction
to
the
marches
that
the
enemy
shall
be
unable
to
learn
from
them
any
thing
relative
to
the
projected
enterprise
if
the
war
is
to
be
offensive
the
staff
officers
arrange
with
the
chief
engineer
officers
what
fortifications
shall
be
erected
near
the
base
of
operations
when
de
or
intrenched
camps
are
to
be
constructed
there
if
the
war
is
defensive
these
works
will
be
built
between
the
first
line
of
defense
and
the
second
base
an
essential
branch
of
logistics
is
certainly
that
which
relates
to
making
arrangements
of
marches
and
attacks
which
are
fixed
by
the
general
and
notice
of
them
given
to
the
proper
persons
by
the
chiefs
of
staff
the
next
most
important
qualification
of
a
general
after
that
of
knowing
how
to
form
good
plans
is
unquestionably
that
of
facilitating
the
execution
of
his
orders
by
their
clearness
of
style
whatever
may
be
the
real
business
of
a
chief
of
staff
the
greatness
of
a
will
be
always
manifested
in
his
plans
but
if
the
general
lacks
ability
the
chief
of
staff
should
supply
it
as
far
as
he
can
having
a
proper
understanding
with
the
responsible
chief
i
have
seen
two
very
different
methods
employed
in
this
branch
of
the
service
the
first
which
may
be
styled
the
old
school
consists
in
issuing
daily
for
the
regulation
of
the
movements
of
the
army
general
instructions
filled
with
minute
and
somewhat
pedantic
details
so
much
the
more
out
of
place
as
they
are
usually
addressed
to
chiefs
of
corps
who
are
supposed
to
be
of
sufficient
experience
not
to
require
the
same
sort
of
instruction
as
would
be
given
to
junior
subalterns
just
out
of
school
the
other
method
is
that
of
the
detached
orders
given
by
napoleon
to
his
marshals
prescribing
for
each
one
simply
what
concerned
himself
and
only
informing
him
what
corps
were
to
operate
with
him
either
on
the
right
or
the
left
but
never
pointing
out
the
connection
of
the
operations
of
the
whole
army
i
have
good
reasons
for
knowing
that
he
did
this
designedly
either
to
surround
his
operations
with
an
air
of
mystery
or
for
fear
that
more
specific
orders
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
assist
him
in
thwarting
his
plans
it
is
certainly
of
great
importance
for
a
general
to
keep
his
plans
secret
and
frederick
the
great
was
right
when
he
said
that
if
his
knew
what
was
in
his
head
he
would
throw
it
into
the
fire
that
kind
of
secrecy
was
practicable
in
frederick
time
when
his
whole
army
was
kept
closely
about
him
but
when
maneuvers
of
the
vastness
of
napoleon
are
executed
and
war
is
waged
as
in
our
day
what
concert
of
action
can
be
expected
from
generals
who
are
utterly
ignorant
of
what
is
going
on
around
them
of
the
two
systems
the
last
seems
to
me
preferable
a
judicious
mean
may
be
adopted
between
the
eccentric
conciseness
of
napoleon
and
the
minute
verbosity
which
laid
down
for
experienced
generals
like
barclay
kleist
and
wittgenstein
precise
directions
for
breaking
into
companies
and
reforming
again
in
line
of
battle
a
piece
of
nonsense
all
the
more
ridiculous
because
the
execution
of
such
an
order
in
presence
of
the
enemy
is
impracticable
it
would
be
sufficient
i
think
in
such
cases
to
give
the
generals
special
orders
relative
to
their
own
corps
and
to
add
a
few
lines
in
cipher
informing
them
briefly
as
to
the
whole
plan
of
the
operations
and
the
part
they
are
to
take
individually
in
executing
it
when
a
proper
cipher
is
wanting
the
order
may
be
transmitted
verbally
by
an
officer
capable
of
understanding
it
and
repeating
it
accurately
indiscreet
revelations
need
then
be
no
longer
feared
and
concert
of
action
would
be
secured
the
army
being
assembled
and
being
in
readiness
to
undertake
some
enterprise
the
important
thing
will
be
to
secure
as
much
concert
and
precision
of
action
as
possible
whilst
taking
all
the
usual
precaution
to
gain
accurate
information
of
the
route
it
is
to
pursue
and
to
cover
its
movements
thoroughly
there
are
two
kinds
of
marches
those
which
are
made
out
of
sight
of
the
enemy
and
those
which
are
made
in
his
presence
either
advancing
or
retiring
these
marches
particularly
have
undergone
great
changes
in
late
years
formerly
armies
seldom
came
in
collision
until
they
had
been
several
days
in
presence
of
each
other
and
the
attacking
party
had
roads
opened
by
pioneers
for
the
columns
to
move
up
parallel
to
each
other
at
present
the
attack
is
made
more
promptly
and
the
existing
roads
usually
answer
all
purposes
it
is
however
of
importance
when
an
army
is
moving
that
pioneers
and
sappers
accompany
the
advanced
guard
to
increase
the
number
of
practicable
roads
to
remove
obstructions
throw
small
bridges
over
creeks
if
necessary
and
secure
the
means
of
easy
communication
between
the
different
corps
of
the
army
in
the
present
manner
of
marching
the
calculation
of
times
and
distances
becomes
more
complicated
the
columns
having
each
a
different
distance
to
pass
over
in
determining
the
hour
of
their
departure
and
giving
them
instructions
the
following
particulars
must
be
considered
the
distances
to
be
passed
over
the
amount
of
in
each
train
the
nature
of
the
country
the
obstacles
placed
in
the
way
by
the
enemy
the
fact
whether
or
not
it
is
important
for
the
march
to
be
concealed
or
open
under
present
circumstances
the
surest
and
simplest
method
of
arranging
the
movements
of
the
great
corps
forming
the
wings
of
an
army
or
of
all
those
corps
not
marching
with
the
column
attached
to
the
general
will
be
to
trust
the
details
to
the
experience
of
the
generals
commanding
those
corps
being
careful
however
to
let
them
understand
that
the
most
exact
punctuality
is
expected
of
them
it
will
then
be
enough
to
indicate
to
them
the
point
to
be
reached
and
the
object
to
be
attained
the
route
to
be
pursued
and
the
hour
at
which
they
will
be
expected
to
be
in
position
they
should
be
informed
what
corps
are
marching
either
on
the
same
roads
with
them
or
on
to
the
right
or
left
in
order
that
they
may
govern
themselves
accordingly
they
should
receive
whatever
news
there
may
be
of
the
enemy
and
have
a
line
of
retreat
indicated
to
them
all
those
details
whose
object
it
is
to
prescribe
each
day
for
the
chiefs
of
corps
the
method
of
forming
their
columns
and
placing
them
in
position
are
mere
pedantry
more
hurtful
than
useful
to
see
that
they
march
habitually
according
to
regulation
or
custom
is
necessary
but
they
should
be
free
to
arrange
their
movements
so
as
to
arrive
at
the
appointed
place
and
time
at
the
risk
of
being
removed
from
their
command
if
they
fail
to
do
so
without
sufficient
reason
in
retreats
however
which
are
made
along
a
single
road
by
an
army
separated
into
divisions
the
hours
of
departure
and
halts
must
be
carefully
regulated
each
column
should
have
its
own
advanced
guard
and
flankers
that
its
march
may
be
conducted
with
the
usual
precautions
it
is
convenient
also
even
when
they
form
part
of
a
second
line
for
the
head
of
each
column
to
be
preceded
by
a
few
pioneers
and
sappers
provided
with
tools
for
removing
obstacles
or
making
repairs
in
case
of
accidents
a
few
of
these
workmen
should
also
accompany
each
train
in
like
manner
a
light
train
will
be
found
very
useful
the
army
on
the
march
is
often
preceded
by
a
general
advanced
guard
or
as
is
more
frequent
in
the
modern
system
the
center
and
each
wing
may
have
its
special
advanced
guard
it
is
customary
for
the
reserves
and
the
center
to
accompany
the
and
the
general
advanced
guard
when
there
is
one
will
usually
follow
the
same
road
so
that
half
the
army
is
thus
assembled
on
the
central
route
under
these
circumstances
the
greatest
care
is
requisite
to
prevent
obstructing
the
road
it
happens
sometimes
however
when
the
important
stroke
is
to
be
made
in
the
direction
of
one
of
the
wings
that
the
reserves
the
general
and
even
the
general
advanced
guard
may
be
moved
in
that
direction
in
this
case
all
the
rules
usually
regulating
the
march
of
the
center
must
be
applied
to
that
wing
advanced
guards
should
be
accompanied
by
good
staff
officers
capable
of
forming
correct
ideas
as
to
the
enemy
movements
and
of
giving
an
accurate
account
of
them
to
the
general
thus
enabling
him
to
make
his
plans
understandingly
the
commander
of
the
advanced
guard
should
assist
the
general
in
the
same
way
a
general
advanced
guard
should
be
composed
of
light
troops
of
all
arms
containing
some
of
the
troops
of
the
army
as
a
main
body
a
few
dragoons
prepared
to
fight
on
foot
some
pontoniers
sappers
with
light
trestles
and
pontoons
for
passing
small
streams
a
few
good
marksmen
will
not
be
out
of
place
a
topographical
officer
should
accompany
it
to
make
a
sketch
of
the
country
a
mile
or
two
on
each
side
of
the
road
a
body
of
irregular
cavalry
should
always
be
attached
to
spare
the
regular
cavalry
and
to
serve
as
scouts
because
they
are
best
suited
to
such
service
as
the
army
advances
and
removes
farther
from
its
base
it
becomes
the
more
necessary
to
have
a
good
line
of
operations
and
of
depots
which
may
keep
up
the
connection
of
the
army
with
its
base
the
staff
officers
will
divide
the
depots
into
departments
the
principal
depot
being
established
in
the
town
which
can
lodge
and
supply
the
greatest
number
of
men
if
there
is
a
fortress
suitably
situated
it
should
be
selected
as
the
site
of
the
principal
depot
the
secondary
depots
may
be
separated
by
distances
of
from
fifteen
to
thirty
miles
usually
in
the
towns
of
the
country
the
mean
distance
apart
will
be
about
twenty
to
miles
this
will
give
fifteen
depots
upon
a
line
of
three
hundred
miles
which
should
be
divided
into
three
or
four
brigades
of
depots
each
of
these
will
have
a
commander
and
a
detachment
of
troops
or
of
convalescent
soldiers
who
regulate
the
arrangements
for
accommodating
troops
and
give
protection
to
the
authorities
of
the
country
if
they
remain
they
furnish
facilities
for
transmitting
the
mails
and
the
necessary
escorts
the
commander
sees
that
the
roads
and
bridges
are
kept
in
good
order
if
possible
there
should
be
a
park
of
several
carriages
at
each
depot
certainly
at
the
principal
one
in
each
brigade
the
command
of
all
the
depots
embraced
within
certain
geographical
limits
should
be
intrusted
to
prudent
and
able
general
officers
for
the
security
of
the
communications
of
the
army
often
depends
on
their
operations
these
commands
may
sometimes
become
strategic
reserves
as
was
explained
in
art
xxiii
a
few
good
battalions
with
the
assistance
of
movable
detachments
passing
continually
between
the
army
and
the
base
will
generally
be
able
to
keep
open
the
communications
the
study
of
the
measures
partly
logistical
and
partly
tactical
to
be
taken
by
the
staff
officers
in
bringing
the
troops
from
the
order
of
march
to
the
different
orders
of
battle
is
very
important
but
requires
going
into
such
minute
detail
that
i
must
pass
it
over
nearly
in
silence
contenting
myself
with
referring
my
readers
to
the
numerous
works
specially
devoted
to
this
branch
of
the
art
of
war
before
leaving
this
interesting
subject
i
think
a
few
examples
should
be
given
as
illustrations
of
the
great
importance
of
a
good
system
of
logistics
one
of
these
examples
is
the
wonderful
concentration
of
the
french
army
in
the
plains
of
gera
in
another
is
the
entrance
of
the
army
upon
the
campaign
of
in
each
of
these
cases
napoleon
possessed
the
ability
to
make
such
arrangements
that
his
columns
starting
from
points
widely
separated
were
concentrated
with
wonderful
precision
upon
the
decisive
point
of
the
zone
of
operations
and
in
this
way
he
insured
the
successful
issue
of
the
campaign
the
choice
of
the
decisive
point
was
the
result
of
a
skillful
application
of
the
principles
of
strategy
and
the
arrangements
for
moving
the
troops
give
us
an
example
of
logistics
which
originated
in
his
own
closet
it
has
been
long
claimed
that
berthier
framed
those
instructions
which
were
conceived
with
so
much
precision
and
usually
transmitted
with
so
much
clearness
but
i
have
had
frequent
opportunities
of
knowing
that
such
was
not
the
truth
the
emperor
was
his
own
chief
staff
officer
provided
with
a
pair
of
dividers
opened
to
a
distance
by
the
scale
of
from
seventeen
to
twenty
miles
in
a
straight
line
which
made
from
to
miles
taking
into
account
the
windings
of
the
roads
bending
over
and
sometimes
stretched
at
full
length
upon
his
map
where
the
positions
of
his
corps
and
the
supposed
positions
of
the
enemy
were
marked
by
pins
of
different
colors
he
was
able
to
give
orders
for
extensive
movements
with
a
certainty
and
precision
which
were
astonishing
turning
his
dividers
about
from
point
to
point
on
the
map
he
decided
in
a
moment
the
number
of
marches
necessary
for
each
of
his
columns
to
arrive
at
the
desired
point
by
a
certain
day
then
placing
pins
in
the
new
positions
and
bearing
in
mind
the
rate
of
marching
that
he
must
assign
to
each
column
and
the
hour
of
its
setting
out
he
dictated
those
instructions
which
are
alone
enough
to
make
any
man
famous
ney
coming
from
the
shores
of
lake
constance
lannes
from
upper
swabia
soult
and
davoust
from
bavaria
and
the
palatinate
bernadotte
and
augereau
from
franconia
and
the
imperial
guard
from
paris
were
all
thus
arranged
in
line
on
three
parallel
roads
to
debouch
simultaneously
between
saalfeld
gera
and
plauen
few
persons
in
the
army
or
in
germany
having
any
conception
of
the
object
of
these
movements
which
seemed
so
very
complicated
in
the
same
manner
in
when
blücher
had
his
army
quietly
in
cantonments
between
the
sambre
and
the
rhine
and
wellington
was
attending
in
brussels
both
waiting
a
signal
for
the
invasion
of
france
napoleon
who
was
supposed
to
be
at
paris
entirely
engrossed
with
diplomatic
ceremonies
at
the
head
of
his
guard
which
had
been
but
recently
reformed
in
the
capital
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
upon
charleroi
and
blücher
quarters
his
columns
arriving
from
all
points
of
the
compass
with
rare
punctuality
on
the
of
june
in
the
plains
of
beaumont
and
upon
the
banks
of
the
sambre
napoleon
did
not
leave
paris
until
the
the
combinations
described
above
were
the
results
of
wise
strategic
calculations
but
their
execution
was
undoubtedly
a
masterpiece
of
logistics
in
order
to
exhibit
more
clearly
the
merit
of
these
measures
i
will
mention
by
way
of
contrast
two
cases
where
faults
in
logistics
came
very
near
leading
to
fatal
consequences
napoleon
having
been
recalled
from
spain
in
by
the
fact
of
austria
taking
up
arms
and
being
certain
that
this
power
intended
war
he
sent
berthier
into
bavaria
upon
the
delicate
duty
of
concentrating
the
army
which
was
extended
from
braunau
as
far
as
strasbourg
and
erfurt
davoust
was
returning
from
the
latter
city
oudinot
from
frankfort
massena
who
had
been
on
his
way
to
spain
was
retiring
toward
ulm
by
the
strasbourg
route
the
saxons
bavarians
and
wurtembergers
were
moving
from
their
respective
countries
the
corps
were
thus
separated
by
great
distances
and
the
austrians
who
had
been
long
concentrated
might
easily
break
through
this
spider
web
or
brush
away
its
threads
napoleon
was
justly
uneasy
and
ordered
berthier
to
assemble
the
army
at
ratisbon
if
the
war
had
not
actually
begun
on
his
arrival
but
if
it
had
to
concentrate
it
in
a
more
retired
position
toward
ulm
the
reason
for
this
alternative
order
was
obvious
if
the
war
had
begun
ratisbon
was
too
near
the
austrian
frontier
for
a
point
of
assembly
as
the
corps
might
thus
be
thrown
separately
into
the
midst
of
two
hundred
thousand
enemies
but
by
fixing
upon
ulm
as
the
point
of
rendezvous
the
army
would
be
concentrated
sooner
or
at
any
rate
the
enemy
would
have
five
or
six
marches
more
to
make
before
which
was
a
consideration
as
the
parties
were
then
situated
no
great
talent
was
needed
to
understand
this
hostilities
having
commenced
however
but
a
few
days
after
berthier
arrival
at
munich
this
too
celebrated
chief
of
staff
was
so
foolish
as
to
adhere
to
a
literal
obedience
of
the
order
he
had
received
without
conceiving
its
obvious
intention
he
not
only
desired
the
army
to
assemble
at
ratisbon
but
even
obliged
davoust
to
return
toward
that
city
when
that
marshal
had
had
the
good
sense
to
fall
back
from
amberg
toward
ingolstadt
napoleon
having
by
good
fortune
been
informed
by
telegraph
of
the
passage
of
the
inn
hours
after
its
occurrence
came
with
the
speed
of
lightning
to
abensberg
just
as
davoust
was
on
the
point
of
being
surrounded
and
his
army
cut
in
two
or
scattered
by
a
mass
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
enemies
we
know
how
wonderfully
napoleon
succeeded
in
rallying
his
army
and
what
victories
he
gained
on
the
glorious
days
of
abensberg
siegberg
landshut
eckmühl
and
ratisbon
that
repaired
the
faults
committed
by
his
chief
of
staff
with
his
contemptible
logistics
we
shall
finish
these
illustrations
with
a
notice
of
the
events
which
preceded
and
were
simultaneous
with
the
passage
of
the
danube
before
the
battle
of
wagram
the
measures
taken
to
bring
to
a
specified
point
of
the
island
of
lobau
the
corps
of
the
viceroy
of
italy
from
hungary
that
of
marmont
from
styria
that
of
bernadotte
from
linz
are
less
wonderful
than
the
famous
imperial
decree
of
articles
which
regulated
the
details
of
the
passage
and
the
formation
of
the
troops
in
the
plains
of
enzersdorf
in
presence
of
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
austrians
and
five
hundred
cannon
as
if
the
operation
had
been
a
military
these
masses
were
all
assembled
upon
the
island
on
the
evening
of
the
of
july
three
bridges
were
immediately
thrown
over
an
arm
of
the
danube
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
wide
on
a
very
dark
night
and
amidst
torrents
of
rain
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
passed
over
the
bridges
in
presence
of
a
formidable
enemy
and
were
drawn
up
before
in
the
plain
three
miles
in
advance
of
the
bridges
which
they
covered
by
a
change
of
front
the
whole
being
accomplished
in
less
time
than
might
have
been
supposed
necessary
had
it
been
a
simple
maneuver
for
instruction
and
after
being
several
times
repeated
the
enemy
had
it
is
true
determined
to
offer
no
serious
opposition
to
the
passage
but
napoleon
did
not
know
that
fact
and
the
merit
of
his
dispositions
is
not
at
all
diminished
by
it
singularly
enough
however
the
chief
of
staff
although
he
made
ten
copies
of
the
famous
decree
did
not
observe
that
by
mistake
the
bridge
of
the
center
had
been
assigned
to
davoust
who
had
the
right
wing
whilst
the
bridge
on
the
right
was
assigned
to
oudinot
who
was
in
the
center
these
two
corps
passed
each
other
in
the
night
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
good
sense
of
the
men
and
their
officers
a
dreadful
scene
of
confusion
might
have
been
the
result
thanks
to
the
supineness
of
the
enemy
the
army
escaped
all
disorder
except
that
arising
from
a
few
detachments
following
corps
to
which
they
did
not
belong
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
the
whole
transaction
is
found
in
the
fact
that
after
such
a
blunder
berthier
should
have
received
the
title
of
prince
of
wagram
the
error
doubtless
originated
with
napoleon
while
dictating
his
decree
but
should
it
not
have
been
detected
by
a
chief
of
staff
who
made
ten
copies
of
the
order
and
whose
duty
it
was
to
supervise
the
formation
of
the
troops
another
no
less
extraordinary
example
of
the
importance
of
good
logistics
was
afforded
at
the
battle
of
leipsic
in
fighting
this
battle
with
a
defile
in
rear
of
the
army
as
at
leipsic
and
in
the
midst
of
low
ground
wooded
and
cut
up
by
small
streams
and
gardens
it
was
highly
important
to
have
a
number
of
small
bridges
to
prepare
the
banks
for
approaching
them
with
ease
and
to
stake
out
the
roads
these
precautions
would
not
have
prevented
the
loss
of
a
decisive
battle
but
they
would
have
saved
the
lives
of
a
considerable
number
of
men
as
well
as
the
guns
and
carriages
that
were
abandoned
on
account
of
the
disorder
and
of
there
being
no
roads
of
escape
the
unaccountable
blowing
up
of
the
bridge
of
lindenau
was
also
the
result
of
unpardonable
carelessness
upon
the
part
of
the
staff
corps
which
indeed
existed
only
in
name
owing
to
the
manner
of
berthier
management
of
it
we
must
also
agree
that
napoleon
who
was
perfectly
conversant
with
the
logistical
measures
of
an
offensive
campaign
had
then
never
seriously
thought
what
would
be
proper
precautions
in
the
event
of
defeat
and
when
the
emperor
was
present
himself
no
one
thought
of
making
any
arrangement
for
the
future
unless
by
his
direction
to
complete
what
i
proposed
when
i
commenced
this
article
it
becomes
necessary
for
me
to
add
some
remarks
with
reference
to
reconnoissances
they
are
of
two
kinds
the
first
are
entirely
topographical
and
statistical
and
their
object
is
to
gain
a
knowledge
of
a
country
its
accidents
of
ground
its
roads
defiles
bridges
and
to
learn
its
resources
and
means
of
every
kind
at
the
present
day
when
the
sciences
of
geography
topography
and
statistics
are
in
such
an
advanced
state
these
reconnoissances
are
less
necessary
than
formerly
but
they
are
still
very
useful
and
it
is
not
probable
that
the
statistics
of
any
country
will
ever
be
so
accurate
that
they
may
be
entirely
dispensed
with
there
are
many
excellent
books
of
instruction
as
to
the
art
of
making
these
reconnoissances
and
i
must
direct
the
attention
of
my
readers
to
them
reconnoissances
of
the
other
kind
are
ordered
when
it
is
necessary
to
gain
information
of
the
movements
of
the
enemy
they
are
made
by
detachments
of
greater
or
less
strength
if
the
enemy
is
drawn
up
in
the
or
the
chiefs
of
staff
make
the
reconnoissance
if
he
is
on
the
march
whole
divisions
of
cavalry
may
be
thrown
out
to
break
through
his
screen
of
posts
footnotes
footnote
i
refer
here
to
general
instructions
and
forms
which
are
not
to
be
repeated
every
day
such
repetition
would
be
impracticable
footnote
the
chiefs
of
artillery
of
engineers
and
of
the
administrative
departments
all
claim
to
have
direct
connection
with
the
and
not
with
the
chief
of
staff
there
should
of
course
be
no
hinderance
to
the
freest
intercourse
between
these
high
officers
and
the
commander
but
he
should
work
with
them
in
presence
of
the
chief
of
staff
and
send
him
all
their
correspondence
otherwise
confusion
is
inevitable
footnote
i
believe
that
at
the
passage
of
the
danube
before
wagram
and
at
the
opening
of
the
second
campaign
of
napoleon
deviated
from
his
usual
custom
by
issuing
a
general
order
footnote
napoleon
never
did
this
because
he
maintained
that
no
general
should
ever
think
seriously
of
the
possibility
of
being
beaten
in
many
marches
it
is
certainly
a
useless
precaution
but
it
is
often
indispensable
footnote
it
may
be
objected
that
in
some
wars
as
where
the
population
is
hostile
it
may
be
very
difficult
or
impracticable
to
organize
lines
of
depots
in
such
cases
they
will
certainly
be
exposed
to
great
dangers
but
these
are
the
very
cases
where
they
are
most
necessary
and
should
be
most
numerous
the
line
from
bayonne
to
madrid
was
such
a
line
which
resisted
for
four
years
the
attacks
of
the
guerrillas
although
convoys
were
sometimes
seized
at
one
time
the
line
extended
as
far
as
cadiz
article
xlii
of
reconnoissances
and
other
means
of
gaining
correct
information
of
the
movements
of
the
enemy
one
of
the
surest
ways
of
forming
good
combinations
in
war
would
be
to
order
movements
only
after
obtaining
perfect
information
of
the
proceedings
in
fact
how
can
any
man
say
what
he
should
do
himself
if
he
is
ignorant
what
his
adversary
is
about
as
it
is
unquestionably
of
the
highest
importance
to
gain
this
information
so
it
is
a
thing
of
the
utmost
difficulty
not
to
say
impossibility
and
this
is
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
the
great
difference
between
the
theory
and
the
practice
of
war
from
this
cause
arise
the
mistakes
of
those
generals
who
are
simply
learned
men
without
a
natural
talent
for
war
and
who
have
not
acquired
that
practical
which
is
imparted
by
long
experience
in
the
direction
of
military
operations
it
is
a
very
easy
matter
for
a
to
make
a
plan
for
outflanking
a
wing
or
threatening
a
line
of
communications
upon
a
map
where
he
can
regulate
the
positions
of
both
parties
to
suit
himself
but
when
he
has
opposed
to
him
a
skillful
active
and
enterprising
adversary
whose
movements
are
a
perfect
riddle
then
his
difficulties
begin
and
we
see
an
exhibition
of
the
incapacity
of
an
ordinary
general
with
none
of
the
resources
of
genius
i
have
seen
so
many
proofs
of
this
truth
in
my
long
life
that
if
i
had
to
put
a
general
to
the
test
i
should
have
a
much
higher
regard
for
the
man
who
could
form
sound
conclusions
as
to
the
movements
of
the
enemy
than
for
him
who
could
make
a
grand
display
of
theories
things
so
difficult
to
put
in
practice
but
so
easily
understood
when
once
exemplified
there
are
four
means
of
obtaining
information
of
the
enemy
operations
the
first
is
a
system
of
espionage
the
second
consists
in
reconnoissances
made
by
skillful
officers
and
light
troops
the
third
in
questioning
prisoners
of
war
the
fourth
in
forming
hypotheses
of
probabilities
this
last
idea
i
will
enlarge
upon
farther
on
there
is
also
a
fifth
method
that
of
signals
although
this
is
used
rather
for
indicating
the
presence
of
the
enemy
than
for
forming
conclusions
as
to
his
designs
it
may
be
classed
with
the
others
spies
will
enable
a
general
to
learn
more
surely
than
by
any
other
agency
what
is
going
on
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
camps
for
reconnoissances
however
well
made
can
give
no
information
of
any
thing
beyond
the
line
of
the
advanced
guard
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
they
should
not
be
resorted
to
for
we
must
use
every
means
of
gaining
information
but
i
do
say
that
their
results
are
small
and
not
to
be
depended
upon
reports
of
prisoners
are
often
useful
but
it
is
generally
dangerous
to
credit
them
a
skillful
chief
of
staff
will
always
be
able
to
select
intelligent
officers
who
can
so
frame
their
questions
as
to
elicit
important
information
from
prisoners
and
deserters
the
partisans
who
are
sent
to
hang
around
the
enemy
lines
of
operations
may
doubtless
learn
something
of
his
movements
but
it
is
almost
impossible
to
communicate
with
them
and
receive
the
information
they
possess
an
extensive
system
of
espionage
will
generally
be
successful
it
is
however
difficult
for
a
spy
to
penetrate
to
the
general
closet
and
learn
the
secret
plans
he
may
form
it
is
best
for
him
therefore
to
limit
himself
to
information
of
what
he
sees
with
his
own
eyes
or
hears
from
reliable
persons
even
when
the
general
receives
from
his
spies
information
of
movements
he
still
knows
nothing
of
those
which
may
since
have
taken
place
nor
of
what
the
enemy
is
going
finally
to
attempt
suppose
for
example
he
learns
that
such
a
corps
has
passed
through
jena
toward
weimar
and
that
another
has
passed
through
gera
toward
naumburg
he
must
still
ask
himself
the
questions
where
are
they
going
and
what
enterprise
are
they
engaged
in
these
things
the
most
skillful
spy
can
not
learn
when
armies
camped
in
tents
and
in
a
single
mass
information
of
the
enemy
operations
was
certain
because
could
be
thrown
forward
in
sight
of
the
camps
and
the
spies
could
report
accurately
their
movements
but
with
the
existing
organization
into
corps
which
either
canton
or
bivouac
it
is
very
difficult
to
learn
any
thing
about
them
spies
may
however
be
very
useful
when
the
hostile
army
is
commanded
by
a
great
captain
or
a
great
sovereign
who
always
moves
with
the
mass
of
his
troops
or
with
the
reserves
such
for
example
were
the
emperors
alexander
and
napoleon
if
it
was
known
when
they
moved
and
what
route
they
followed
it
was
not
difficult
to
conclude
what
project
was
in
view
and
the
details
of
the
movements
of
smaller
bodies
needed
not
to
be
attended
to
particularly
a
skillful
general
may
supply
the
defects
of
the
other
methods
by
making
reasonable
and
hypotheses
i
can
with
great
satisfaction
say
that
this
means
hardly
ever
failed
me
though
fortune
never
placed
me
at
the
head
of
an
army
i
have
been
chief
of
staff
to
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
men
and
have
been
many
times
called
into
the
councils
of
the
greatest
sovereigns
of
the
day
when
the
question
under
consideration
was
the
proper
direction
to
give
to
the
combined
armies
of
europe
and
i
was
never
more
than
two
or
three
times
mistaken
in
my
hypotheses
and
in
my
manner
of
solving
the
difficulties
they
offered
as
i
have
said
before
i
have
constantly
noticed
that
as
an
army
can
operate
only
upon
the
center
or
one
extremity
of
its
front
of
operations
there
are
seldom
more
than
three
or
four
suppositions
that
can
possibly
be
made
a
mind
fully
convinced
of
these
truths
and
conversant
with
the
principles
of
war
will
always
be
able
to
form
a
plan
which
will
provide
in
advance
for
the
probable
contingencies
of
the
future
i
will
cite
a
few
examples
which
have
come
under
my
own
observation
in
when
people
in
france
were
still
uncertain
as
to
the
war
with
prussia
i
wrote
a
memoir
upon
the
probabilities
of
the
war
and
the
operations
which
would
take
place
i
made
the
three
following
hypotheses
the
prussians
will
await
napoleon
attack
behind
the
elbe
and
will
fight
on
the
defensive
as
far
as
the
oder
in
expectation
of
aid
from
russia
and
austria
or
they
will
advance
upon
the
saale
resting
their
left
upon
the
frontier
of
bohemia
and
defending
the
passes
of
the
mountains
of
franconia
or
else
expecting
the
french
by
the
great
mayence
road
they
will
advance
imprudently
to
erfurt
i
do
not
believe
any
other
suppositions
could
be
made
unless
the
prussians
were
thought
to
be
so
foolish
as
to
divide
their
forces
already
inferior
to
the
french
upon
the
two
directions
of
wesel
and
mayence
a
useless
mistake
since
there
had
not
been
a
french
soldier
on
the
first
of
these
roads
since
the
seven
years
war
these
hypotheses
having
been
made
as
above
stated
if
any
one
should
ask
what
course
napoleon
ought
to
pursue
it
was
easy
to
reply
that
the
mass
of
the
french
army
being
already
assembled
in
bavaria
it
should
be
thrown
upon
the
left
of
the
prussians
by
way
of
grera
and
hof
for
the
gordian
knot
of
the
campaign
was
in
that
direction
no
matter
what
plan
they
should
adopt
if
they
advanced
to
erfurt
he
could
move
to
gera
cut
their
line
of
retreat
and
press
them
back
along
the
lower
elbe
to
the
north
sea
if
they
rested
upon
the
saale
he
could
attack
their
left
by
way
of
hof
and
gera
defeat
them
partially
and
reach
berlin
before
them
by
way
of
leipsic
if
they
stood
fast
behind
the
elbe
he
must
still
attack
them
by
way
of
gera
and
hof
since
napoleon
direction
of
operations
was
so
clearly
fixed
what
mattered
it
to
him
to
know
the
details
of
their
movements
being
certain
of
the
correctness
of
these
principles
i
did
not
hesitate
to
announce
month
before
the
that
napoleon
would
attempt
just
what
he
did
and
that
if
the
prussians
passed
the
saale
battles
would
take
place
at
jena
and
naumburg
i
relate
this
circumstance
not
from
a
feeling
of
vanity
for
if
that
were
my
motive
i
might
mention
many
more
of
a
similar
character
i
have
only
been
anxious
to
show
that
in
war
a
plan
of
operations
may
be
often
arranged
simply
based
upon
the
general
principles
of
the
art
without
much
attention
being
of
necessity
given
to
the
details
of
the
movements
returning
to
our
subject
i
must
state
that
the
use
of
spies
has
been
neglected
to
a
remarkable
degree
in
many
modern
armies
in
the
staff
of
prince
schwarzenberg
had
not
a
single
sou
for
expenditure
for
such
services
and
the
emperor
alexander
was
obliged
to
furnish
the
staff
officers
with
funds
from
his
own
private
purse
to
enable
them
to
send
agents
into
lusatia
for
the
purpose
of
finding
out
whereabouts
general
mack
at
ulm
and
the
duke
of
brunswick
in
were
no
better
informed
and
the
french
generals
in
spain
often
suffered
severely
because
it
was
impossible
to
obtain
spies
and
to
get
information
as
to
what
was
going
on
around
them
the
russian
army
is
better
provided
than
any
other
for
gathering
information
by
the
use
of
roving
bodies
of
cossacks
and
history
confirms
my
assertion
the
expedition
of
prince
koudacheff
who
was
sent
after
the
battle
of
dresden
to
the
prince
of
sweden
and
who
crossed
the
elbe
by
swimming
and
marched
in
the
midst
of
the
french
columns
as
far
nearly
as
wittenberg
is
a
remarkable
instance
of
this
class
the
information
furnished
by
the
partisan
troops
of
generals
czernicheff
benkendorf
davidoff
and
seslawin
was
exceedingly
valuable
we
may
recollect
it
was
through
a
dispatch
from
napoleon
to
the
empress
maria
louisa
intercepted
near
châlons
by
the
cossacks
that
the
allies
were
informed
of
the
plan
he
had
formed
of
falling
upon
their
communications
with
his
whole
disposable
force
basing
his
operations
upon
the
fortified
towns
of
lorraine
and
alsace
this
piece
of
information
decided
blücher
and
schwarzenberg
to
effect
a
junction
of
their
armies
which
the
plainest
principles
of
strategy
had
never
previously
brought
to
act
in
concert
except
at
leipsic
and
brienne
we
know
also
that
the
warning
given
by
seslawin
to
general
doctoroff
saved
him
from
being
crushed
at
borovsk
by
napoleon
who
had
just
left
moscow
in
retreat
with
his
whole
army
doctoroff
did
not
at
first
credit
this
news
which
so
irritated
seslawin
that
he
effected
the
capture
of
a
french
officer
and
several
soldiers
of
the
guard
from
the
french
bivouacs
and
sent
them
as
proofs
of
its
correctness
this
warning
which
decided
the
march
of
koutousoff
to
prevented
napoleon
from
taking
the
way
by
kalouga
where
he
would
have
found
greater
facilities
for
refitting
his
army
and
would
have
escaped
the
disastrous
days
of
krasnoi
and
the
beresina
the
catastrophe
which
befell
him
would
thus
have
been
lessened
though
not
entirely
prevented
such
examples
rare
as
they
are
give
us
an
excellent
idea
of
what
good
partisan
troops
can
accomplish
when
led
by
good
officers
i
will
conclude
this
article
with
the
following
summary
a
general
should
neglect
no
means
of
gaining
information
of
the
enemy
movements
and
for
this
purpose
should
make
use
of
reconnoissances
spies
bodies
of
light
troops
commanded
by
capable
officers
signals
and
questioning
deserters
and
prisoners
by
multiplying
the
means
of
obtaining
information
for
no
matter
how
imperfect
and
contradictory
they
may
be
the
truth
may
often
be
sifted
from
them
perfect
reliance
should
be
placed
on
none
of
these
means
as
it
is
impossible
to
obtain
exact
information
by
the
methods
mentioned
a
general
should
never
move
without
arranging
several
courses
of
action
for
himself
based
upon
probable
hypotheses
that
the
relative
situation
of
the
armies
enables
him
to
make
and
never
losing
sight
of
the
principles
of
the
art
i
can
assure
a
general
that
with
such
precautions
nothing
very
unexpected
can
befall
him
and
cause
his
ruin
as
has
so
often
happened
to
others
for
unless
he
is
totally
unfit
to
command
an
army
he
should
at
least
be
able
to
form
reasonable
suppositions
as
to
what
the
enemy
is
going
to
do
and
fix
for
himself
a
certain
line
of
conduct
to
suit
each
of
these
hypotheses
it
can
not
be
too
much
insisted
upon
that
the
real
secret
of
military
genius
consists
in
the
ability
to
make
these
reasonable
suppositions
in
any
case
and
although
their
number
is
always
small
it
is
wonderful
how
much
this
means
of
regulating
one
conduct
is
neglected
in
order
to
make
this
article
complete
i
must
state
what
is
to
be
gained
by
using
a
system
of
signals
of
these
there
are
several
kinds
telegraphic
signals
may
be
mentioned
as
the
most
important
of
all
napoleon
owes
his
astonishing
success
at
ratisbon
in
to
the
fact
of
his
having
established
a
telegraphic
communication
between
the
of
the
army
and
france
he
was
still
at
paris
when
the
austrian
army
crossed
the
inn
at
braunau
with
the
intention
of
invading
bavaria
and
breaking
through
his
line
of
cantonments
informed
in
hours
of
what
was
passing
at
a
distance
of
seven
hundred
miles
he
threw
himself
into
his
and
a
week
later
he
had
gained
two
victories
under
the
walls
of
ratisbon
without
the
telegraph
the
campaign
would
have
been
lost
this
single
fact
is
sufficient
to
impress
us
with
an
idea
of
its
value
it
has
been
proposed
to
use
portable
telegraphs
such
a
telegraphic
arrangement
operated
by
men
on
horseback
posted
on
high
ground
could
communicate
the
orders
of
the
center
to
the
extremities
of
a
line
of
battle
as
well
as
the
reports
of
the
wings
to
the
repeated
trials
of
it
were
made
in
russia
but
the
project
was
given
up
for
what
reason
however
i
have
not
been
able
to
learn
these
communications
could
only
be
very
brief
and
in
misty
weather
the
method
could
not
be
depended
upon
a
vocabulary
for
such
purposes
could
be
reduced
to
a
few
short
phrases
which
might
easily
be
represented
by
signs
i
think
it
a
method
by
no
means
useless
even
if
it
should
be
necessary
to
send
duplicates
of
the
orders
by
officers
capable
of
transmitting
them
with
accuracy
there
would
certainly
be
a
gain
of
rapidity
attempt
of
another
kind
was
made
in
at
the
battle
of
fleurus
where
general
jourdan
made
use
of
the
services
of
a
balloonist
to
observe
and
give
notice
of
the
movements
of
the
austrians
i
am
not
aware
that
he
found
the
method
a
very
useful
one
as
it
was
not
again
used
but
it
was
claimed
at
the
time
that
it
assisted
in
gaining
him
the
victory
of
this
however
i
have
great
doubts
it
is
probable
that
the
difficulty
of
having
a
balloonist
in
readiness
to
make
an
ascension
at
the
proper
moment
and
of
his
making
careful
observations
upon
what
is
going
on
below
whilst
floating
at
the
mercy
of
the
winds
above
has
led
to
the
abandonment
of
this
method
of
gaining
information
by
giving
the
balloon
no
great
elevation
sending
up
with
it
an
officer
capable
of
forming
correct
opinions
as
to
the
movements
and
perfecting
a
system
of
signals
to
be
used
in
connection
with
the
balloon
considerable
advantages
might
be
expected
from
its
use
sometimes
the
smoke
of
the
battle
and
the
difficulty
of
distinguishing
the
columns
that
look
like
liliputians
so
as
to
know
to
which
party
they
belong
will
make
the
reports
of
the
balloonists
very
unreliable
for
example
a
balloonist
would
have
been
greatly
embarrassed
in
deciding
at
the
battle
of
waterloo
whether
it
was
grouchy
or
blücher
who
was
seen
coming
up
by
the
road
but
this
uncertainty
need
not
exist
where
the
armies
are
not
so
much
mixed
i
had
ocular
proof
of
the
advantage
to
be
derived
from
such
observations
when
i
was
stationed
in
the
spire
of
gautsch
at
the
battle
of
leipsic
and
prince
schwarzenberg
whom
i
had
conducted
to
the
same
point
could
not
deny
that
it
was
at
my
solicitation
the
prince
was
prevailed
upon
to
emerge
from
the
marsh
between
the
pleisse
and
the
elster
an
observer
is
doubtless
more
at
his
ease
in
a
than
in
a
frail
basket
floating
in
but
steeples
are
not
always
at
hand
in
the
vicinity
of
and
they
can
not
be
transported
at
pleasure
there
is
still
another
method
of
signaling
by
the
use
of
large
fires
kindled
upon
elevated
points
of
the
country
before
the
invention
of
the
telegraph
they
afforded
the
means
of
transmitting
the
news
of
an
invasion
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
the
swiss
have
made
use
of
them
to
call
the
militia
to
arms
they
have
been
also
used
to
give
the
alarm
to
winter
quarters
and
to
assemble
the
troops
more
rapidly
the
may
be
made
still
more
useful
if
arranged
so
as
to
indicate
to
the
corps
of
the
army
the
direction
of
the
threatening
movements
and
the
point
where
they
should
concentrate
to
meet
him
these
signals
may
also
serve
on
to
give
notice
of
descents
finally
there
is
a
kind
of
signals
given
to
troops
during
an
action
by
means
of
military
instruments
this
method
of
signals
has
been
brought
to
greater
perfection
in
the
russian
army
than
in
any
other
i
know
of
while
i
am
aware
of
the
great
importance
of
discovering
a
sure
method
of
setting
in
motion
simultaneously
a
large
mass
of
troops
at
the
will
of
the
commander
i
am
convinced
that
it
must
be
a
long
time
before
the
problem
is
solved
signals
with
instruments
are
of
little
use
except
for
skirmishers
a
movement
of
a
long
line
of
troops
may
be
made
nearly
simultaneous
by
means
of
a
shout
begun
at
one
point
and
passed
rapidly
from
man
to
man
but
these
shouts
seem
generally
to
be
a
sort
of
inspiration
and
are
seldom
the
result
of
an
order
i
have
seen
but
two
cases
of
it
in
thirteen
campaigns

what
is
to
be
understood
by
the
term
of
it
is
proper
to
add
in
what
manner
it
is
to
be
formed
and
how
the
different
troops
are
to
be
distributed
in
it
before
the
french
revolution
all
the
infantry
formed
in
regiments
and
brigades
was
collected
in
a
single
drawn
up
in
two
lines
each
of
which
had
a
right
and
a
left
wing
the
cavalry
was
usually
placed
upon
the
wings
and
the
artillery
which
at
this
period
was
very
unwieldy
was
distributed
along
the
front
of
each
line
the
army
camped
together
marching
by
lines
or
by
wings
and
as
there
were
two
cavalry
wings
and
two
infantry
wings
if
the
march
was
by
wings
four
columns
were
thus
formed
when
they
marched
by
lines
which
was
specially
applicable
to
flank
movements
two
columns
were
formed
unless
on
account
of
local
circumstances
the
cavalry
or
a
part
of
the
infantry
had
camped
in
a
third
line
which
was
rare
this
method
simplified
logistics
very
much
since
it
was
only
necessary
to
give
such
orders
as
the
following
the
army
will
move
in
such
direction
by
lines
or
by
wings
by
the
right
or
by
the
left
this
monotonous
but
simple
formation
was
seldom
deviated
from
and
no
better
could
have
been
devised
as
war
was
carried
on
in
those
days
the
french
attempted
something
new
at
minden
by
forming
as
many
columns
as
brigades
and
opening
roads
to
bring
them
to
the
front
in
line
a
simple
impossibility
if
the
labor
of
staff
officers
was
diminished
by
this
method
of
camping
and
marching
by
lines
it
must
be
evident
that
if
such
a
system
were
applied
to
an
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
or
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
there
would
be
no
end
to
the
columns
and
the
result
would
be
the
frequent
occurrence
of
routs
like
that
of
rossbach
the
french
revolution
introduced
the
system
of
divisions
which
broke
up
the
excessive
compactness
of
the
old
formation
and
brought
upon
the
field
fractions
capable
of
independent
movement
on
any
kind
of
ground
this
change
was
a
real
improvement
although
they
went
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
by
returning
nearly
to
the
legionary
formation
of
the
romans
these
divisions
composed
usually
of
infantry
artillery
and
cavalry
maneuvered
and
fought
separately
they
were
very
much
extended
either
to
enable
them
to
subsist
without
the
use
of
depots
or
with
an
absurd
expectation
of
prolonging
the
line
in
order
to
outflank
that
of
the
enemy
the
seven
or
eight
divisions
of
an
army
were
sometimes
seen
marching
on
the
same
number
of
roads
ten
or
twelve
miles
distant
from
each
other
the
was
at
the
center
with
no
other
support
than
five
or
six
small
regiments
of
cavalry
of
three
hundred
or
four
hundred
men
each
so
that
if
the
enemy
concentrated
the
mass
of
his
forces
against
one
of
these
divisions
and
beat
it
the
line
was
pierced
and
the
having
no
disposable
infantry
reserve
could
do
nothing
but
order
a
retreat
to
rally
his
scattered
columns
bonaparte
in
his
first
italian
campaign
remedied
this
difficulty
partly
by
the
mobility
of
his
army
and
the
rapidity
of
his
maneuvers
and
partly
by
concentrating
the
mass
of
his
divisions
upon
the
point
where
the
decisive
blow
was
to
fall
when
he
became
the
head
of
the
government
and
saw
the
sphere
of
his
means
and
his
plans
constantly
increasing
in
magnitude
he
readily
perceived
that
a
stronger
organization
was
necessary
he
avoided
the
extremes
of
the
old
system
and
the
new
while
still
retaining
the
advantages
of
the
divisional
system
beginning
with
the
campaign
of
he
organized
corps
of
two
or
three
divisions
which
he
placed
under
the
command
of
and
formed
of
them
the
wings
the
center
and
the
reserve
of
his
army
this
system
was
finally
developed
fully
at
the
camp
of
boulogne
where
he
organized
permanent
army
corps
under
the
command
of
marshals
who
had
under
their
orders
three
divisions
of
infantry
one
of
light
cavalry
from
to
forty
pieces
of
cannon
and
a
number
of
sappers
each
corps
was
thus
a
small
army
able
at
need
to
act
independently
as
an
army
the
heavy
cavalry
was
collected
in
a
single
strong
reserve
composed
of
two
divisions
of
cuirassiers
four
of
dragoons
and
one
of
light
cavalry
the
grenadiers
and
the
guard
formed
an
admirable
infantry
reserve
at
a
later
period
the
cavalry
was
also
organized
into
corps
of
three
divisions
to
give
greater
unity
of
action
to
the
masses
of
this
arm
this
organization
was
as
near
perfection
as
possible
and
the
grand
army
that
brought
about
such
great
results
was
the
model
which
all
the
armies
of
europe
soon
imitated
some
military
men
in
their
attempts
to
perfect
the
art
have
recommended
that
the
infantry
division
which
sometimes
has
to
act
independently
should
contain
three
instead
of
two
brigades
because
this
number
will
allow
one
for
the
center
and
each
wing
this
would
certainly
be
an
improvement
for
if
the
division
contains
but
two
brigades
there
is
an
open
space
left
in
the
center
between
the
brigades
on
the
wings
these
brigades
having
no
common
central
support
can
not
with
safety
act
independently
of
each
other
besides
this
with
three
brigades
in
a
division
two
may
be
engaged
while
the
third
is
held
in
reserve
a
manifest
advantage
but
if
thirty
brigades
formed
in
ten
divisions
of
three
brigades
are
better
than
when
formed
in
fifteen
divisions
of
two
brigades
it
becomes
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
this
perfect
divisional
organization
to
increase
the
numbers
of
the
infantry
by
or
to
reduce
the
divisions
of
the
from
three
to
two
which
last
would
be
a
serious
disadvantage
because
the
is
much
more
frequently
called
upon
to
act
independently
than
a
division
and
the
subdivision
into
three
parts
is
specially
best
for
that
what
is
the
best
organization
to
be
given
an
army
just
setting
out
upon
a
campaign
will
for
a
long
time
to
come
be
a
problem
in
logistics
because
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
maintain
the
original
organization
in
the
midst
of
the
operations
of
war
and
detachments
must
be
sent
out
continually
the
history
of
the
grand
army
of
boulogne
whose
organization
seemed
to
leave
nothing
farther
to
be
desired
proves
the
assertion
just
made
the
center
under
soult
the
right
under
davoust
the
left
under
ney
and
the
reserve
under
lannes
formed
together
a
regular
and
formidable
of
thirteen
divisions
of
infantry
without
counting
those
of
the
guard
and
the
grenadiers
besides
these
the
corps
of
bernadotte
and
marmont
detached
to
the
right
and
that
of
augereau
to
the
left
were
ready
for
action
on
the
flanks
but
after
the
passage
of
the
danube
at
donauwerth
every
thing
was
changed
ney
at
first
reinforced
to
five
divisions
was
reduced
to
two
the
was
divided
partly
to
the
right
and
partly
to
the
left
so
that
this
fine
arrangement
was
destroyed
it
will
always
be
difficult
to
fix
upon
a
stable
organization
events
are
however
seldom
so
complicated
as
those
of
and
campaign
of
proves
that
the
original
organization
may
sometimes
be
maintained
at
least
for
the
mass
of
the
army
with
this
view
it
would
seem
prudent
to
organize
an
army
in
four
parts
two
wings
a
center
and
a
reserve
the
composition
of
these
parts
may
vary
with
the
strength
of
the
army
but
in
order
to
retain
this
organization
it
becomes
necessary
to
have
a
certain
number
of
divisions
out
of
the
general
line
in
order
to
furnish
the
necessary
detachments
while
these
divisions
are
with
the
army
they
may
be
attached
to
that
part
which
is
to
receive
or
give
the
heaviest
blows
or
they
may
be
employed
on
the
flanks
of
the
main
body
or
to
increase
the
strength
of
the
reserve
bach
of
the
four
great
parts
of
the
army
may
be
a
single
corps
of
three
or
four
divisions
or
two
corps
of
two
divisions
each
in
this
last
case
there
would
be
seven
corps
allowing
one
for
the
reserve
but
this
last
corps
should
contain
three
divisions
to
give
a
reserve
to
each
wing
and
to
the
center
with
seven
corps
unless
several
more
are
kept
out
of
the
general
line
in
order
to
furnish
detachments
it
may
happen
that
the
extreme
corps
may
be
detached
so
that
each
wing
might
contain
but
two
divisions
and
from
these
a
brigade
might
be
occasionally
detached
to
flank
the
march
of
the
army
leaving
but
three
brigades
to
a
wing
this
would
be
a
weak
order
of
battle
these
facts
lead
me
to
conclude
that
an
organization
of
the
line
of
battle
in
four
corps
of
three
divisions
of
infantry
and
one
of
light
cavalry
with
three
or
four
divisions
for
detachments
would
be
more
stable
than
one
of
seven
corps
each
of
two
divisions
but
as
every
thing
depends
upon
the
strength
of
the
army
and
of
the
units
of
which
it
is
composed
as
well
as
upon
the
character
of
the
operations
in
which
it
may
be
engaged
the
arrangement
may
be
greatly
varied
i
can
not
go
into
these
details
and
shall
simply
exhibit
the
principal
combinations
that
may
result
from
forming
the
divisions
in
two
or
three
brigades
and
the
corps
in
two
or
three
divisions
i

corps

might
be
so
drawn
up
as
to
have
one

in

and

in

the
question
here
presents
itself
whether
it
is
ever
proper
to
place
two
corps
one
behind
the
other
as
napoleon
often
did
particularly
at
wagram
i
think
that
except
for
the
reserves
this
arrangement
may
be
used
only
in
a
position
of
expectation
and
never
as
an
order
of
battle
for
it
is
much
better
for
each
corps
to
have
its
own
second
line
and
its
reserve
than
to
pile
up
several
corps
one
behind
the
other
under
different
commanders
however
much
one
general
may
be
disposed
to
support
a
colleague
he
will
always
object
to
dividing
up
his
troops
for
that
purpose
and
when
in
the
general
of
the
first
line
he
sees
not
a
colleague
but
a
hated
rival
as
too
frequently
happens
it
is
probable
he
will
be
very
slow
in
furnishing
the
assistance
which
may
be
greatly
needed
moreover
a
commander
whose
troops
are
spread
out
in
a
long
line
can
not
execute
his
maneuvers
with
near
so
much
facility
as
if
his
front
was
only
half
as
great
and
was
supported
by
the
remainder
of
his
own
troops
drawn
up
in
rear
the
table
below
will
show
that
the
number
of
men
in
an
army
will
have
great
influence
in
determining
the
best
formation
for
it
and
that
the
subject
is
a
complicated
one
in
making
our
calculations
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
provide
for
the
case
of
such
immense
masses
being
in
the
field
as
were
seen
from
to
when
a
single
army
contained
fourteen
corps
varying
in
strength
from
two
to
five
divisions
with
such
large
numbers
nothing
better
can
be
proposed
than
a
subdivision
into
corps
of
three
divisions
each
of
these
corps
eight
would
form
the
main
body
and
there
would
remain
six
for
detachments
and
for
strengthening
any
point
of
the
main
line
that
might
require
support
if
this
system
be
applied
to
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
it
would
be
hardly
practicable
to
employ
divisions
of
two
brigades
each
where
napoleon
and
the
allies
used
corps
if
nine
divisions
form
the
main
body
that
is
the
wings
and
the
center
and
six
others
form
the
reserve
and
detachments
fifteen
divisions
would
be
required
or
thirty
brigades
which
would
make
one
hundred
and
eighty
battalions
if
each
regiment
contains
three
battalions
this
supposition
brings
our
army
up
to
one
hundred
and
thousand
and
two
hundred
thousand
in
all
with
regiments
of
two
battalions
there
would
be
required
one
hundred
and
twenty
battalions
or
thousand
infantry
but
if
each
regiment
contains
but
two
battalions
each
battalion
should
be
one
thousand
men
strong
and
this
would
increase
the
infantry
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
and
the
entire
army
to
one
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
men
these
calculations
show
that
the
strength
of
the
minor
subdivisions
must
be
carefully
considered
in
arranging
into
corps
and
divisions
if
an
army
does
not
contain
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
men
the
formation
by
divisions
is
perhaps
better
than
by
corps
an
example
of
this
was
napoleon
army
of
having
now
endeavored
to
explain
the
best
method
of
giving
a
somewhat
permanent
organization
to
the
main
body
of
an
army
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
for
me
to
inquire
whether
this
permanency
is
desirable
and
if
it
is
not
advantageous
to
deceive
the
enemy
by
frequently
changing
the
composition
of
corps
and
their
positions
i
admit
the
advantage
of
thus
deceiving
the
enemy
but
it
may
be
gained
while
still
retaining
a
quite
constant
organization
of
the
main
body
if
the
divisions
intended
for
detachments
are
joined
to
the
wings
and
the
center
that
is
if
those
parts
contain
each
four
divisions
instead
of
three
and
if
one
or
two
divisions
be
occasionally
added
to
the
wing
which
is
likely
to
bear
the
brunt
of
an
engagement
each
wing
will
be
a
corps
properly
of
four
divisions
but
detachments
will
generally
reduce
it
to
three
and
sometimes
two
while
it
might
again
be
reinforced
by
a
portion
of
the
reserve
until
it
reached
five
divisions
the
enemy
would
thus
never
know
exactly
the
strength
of
the
different
parts
of
the
line
but
i
have
dwelt
sufficiently
on
these
details
it
is
probable
that
whatever
be
the
strength
and
number
of
the
subdivisions
of
an
army
the
organization
into
corps
will
long
be
retained
by
all
the
great
powers
of
europe
and
calculations
for
the
arrangement
of
the
line
of
battle
must
be
made
upon
that
basis
the
distribution
of
the
troops
in
the
line
of
battle
has
changed
in
recent
times
as
well
as
the
manner
of
arranging
the
line
formerly
it
was
usually
composed
of
two
lines
but
now
of
two
lines
and
one
or
more
reserves
in
recent
conflicts
in
europe
when
the
masses
brought
into
collision
were
very
large
the
corps
were
not
only
formed
in
two
lines
but
one
corps
was
placed
behind
another
thus
making
four
lines
and
the
reserve
being
drawn
up
in
the
same
manner
six
lines
of
infantry
were
often
the
result
and
several
of
cavalry
such
a
formation
may
answer
well
enough
as
a
preparatory
one
but
is
by
no
means
the
best
for
battle
as
it
is
entirely
too
deep
the
classical
formation
if
i
may
employ
that
term
is
still
two
lines
for
the
infantry
the
greater
or
less
extent
of
the
and
the
strength
of
an
army
may
necessarily
produce
greater
depth
at
times
but
these
cases
are
the
exceptions
because
the
formation
of
two
lines
and
the
reserves
gives
sufficient
solidity
and
enables
a
greater
number
of
men
to
be
simultaneously
engaged
when
an
army
has
a
permanent
advanced
guard
it
may
be
either
formed
in
front
of
the
line
of
battle
or
be
carried
to
the
rear
to
strengthen
the
reserve
but
as
has
been
previously
stated
this
will
not
often
happen
with
the
present
method
of
forming
and
moving
armies
each
wing
has
usually
its
own
advanced
guard
and
the
advanced
guard
of
the
main
or
central
portion
of
the
army
is
naturally
furnished
by
the
leading
corps
upon
coming
into
view
of
the
enemy
these
advanced
bodies
return
to
their
proper
positions
in
line
of
battle
often
the
cavalry
reserve
is
almost
entirely
with
the
advanced
guard
but
this
does
not
prevent
its
taking
when
necessary
the
place
fixed
for
it
in
the
line
of
battle
by
the
character
of
the
position
or
by
the
wishes
of
the
commanding
general
from
what
has
been
stated
above
my
readers
will
gather
that
very
great
changes
of
army
organization
took
place
from
the
time
of
the
revival
of
the
art
of
war
and
the
invention
of
gunpowder
to
the
french
revolution
and
that
to
have
a
proper
appreciation
of
the
wars
of
louis
of
peter
the
great
and
of
frederick
they
should
consider
them
from
the
of
those
days
one
portion
of
the
old
method
may
still
be
employed
and
if
by
way
of
example
it
may
not
be
regarded
as
a
fundamental
rule
to
post
the
cavalry
on
the
wings
it
may
still
be
a
very
good
arrangement
for
an
army
of
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
men
especially
when
the
ground
in
the
center
is
not
so
suitable
for
the
evolutions
of
cavalry
as
that
near
the
extremities
it
is
usual
to
attach
one
or
two
brigades
of
light
cavalry
to
each
infantry
corps
those
of
the
center
being
placed
in
preference
to
the
rear
whilst
those
of
the
wings
are
placed
upon
the
flanks
if
the
reserves
of
cavalry
are
sufficiently
numerous
to
permit
the
organization
of
three
corps
of
this
arm
giving
one
as
reserve
to
the
center
and
one
to
each
wing
the
arrangement
is
certainly
a
good
one
if
that
is
impossible
this
reserve
may
be
formed
in
two
columns
one
on
the
right
of
the
left
wing
and
the
other
on
the
left
of
the
right
wing
these
columns
may
thus
readily
move
to
any
point
of
the
line
that
may
be
threatened
the
artillery
of
the
present
day
has
greater
mobility
and
may
as
formerly
be
distributed
along
the
front
that
of
each
division
remaining
near
it
it
may
be
observed
moreover
that
the
organization
of
the
artillery
having
been
greatly
improved
an
advantageous
distribution
of
it
may
be
more
readily
made
but
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
scatter
it
too
much
few
precise
rules
can
be
laid
down
for
the
proper
distribution
of
artillery
who
for
example
would
dare
to
advise
as
a
rule
the
filling
up
of
a
large
gap
in
a
line
of
battle
with
one
hundred
pieces
of
cannon
in
a
single
battery
without
adequate
support
as
napoleon
did
successfully
at
wagram
i
do
not
desire
to
go
here
into
much
detail
with
reference
to
the
use
of
this
arm
but
i
will
give
the
following
rules
the
should
be
placed
on
such
ground
that
it
can
move
freely
in
every
direction
on
the
contrary
and
especially
that
of
heavy
caliber
will
be
best
posted
where
protected
by
ditches
or
hedges
from
sudden
charges
of
cavalry
it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
add
what
every
young
officer
should
know
already
that
too
elevated
positions
are
not
those
to
give
artillery
its
greatest
effect
flat
or
ground
is
better
the
usually
maneuvers
with
the
cavalry
but
it
is
well
for
each
to
have
its
own
to
be
readily
thrown
into
any
desired
position
it
is
moreover
proper
to
have
in
reserve
which
may
be
carried
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
any
threatened
point
general
benningsen
had
great
cause
for
at
eylau
because
he
had
fifty
light
guns
in
reserve
for
they
had
a
powerful
influence
in
enabling
him
to
recover
himself
when
his
line
had
been
broken
through
between
the
center
and
the
left
on
the
defensive
it
is
well
to
place
some
of
the
heavy
batteries
in
front
instead
of
holding
them
in
reserve
since
it
is
desirable
to
attack
the
enemy
at
the
greatest
possible
distance
with
a
view
of
checking
his
forward
movement
and
causing
disorder
in
his
columns
on
the
defensive
it
seems
also
advisable
to
have
the
artillery
not
in
reserve
distributed
at
equal
intervals
in
batteries
along
the
whole
line
since
it
is
important
to
repel
the
enemy
at
all
points
this
must
not
however
be
regarded
as
an
invariable
rule
for
the
character
of
the
position
and
the
designs
of
the
enemy
may
oblige
the
mass
of
the
artillery
to
move
to
a
wing
or
to
the
center
in
the
offensive
it
is
equally
advantageous
to
concentrate
a
very
powerful
upon
a
single
point
where
it
is
desired
to
make
a
decisive
stroke
with
a
view
of
shattering
the
enemy
line
to
such
a
degree
that
he
will
be
unable
to
withstand
an
attack
upon
which
the
fate
of
the
battle
is
to
turn
i
shall
at
another
place
have
more
to
say
as
to
the
employment
of
artillery

formation

of

infantry
is
undoubtedly
the
most
important
arm
of
the
service
since
it
forms
of
an
army
and
is
used
both
in
the
attack
and
defense
of
positions
if
we
must
admit
that
next
to
the
genius
of
the
general
the
infantry
arm
is
the
most
valuable
instrument
in
gaining
a
victory
it
is
no

true
that
most
important
aid
is
given
by
the
cavalry
and
artillery
and
that
without
their
assistance
the
infantry
might
at
times
be
very
seriously
compromised

at
others
could
achieve
only
partial
success
we
shall
not
here
introduce
those
old
discussions
about
the
shallow
and
the
deep
formations
although
the
question
which
was
supposed
decided
is
far
from
being
settled
absolutely
the
war
in

the
battle
of
waterloo
have
again
given
rise

disputes
as

the
relative
advantages

the
shallow

the

will
give
my
own
opinion
farther
on
there
must
however
be
no
misconception
on
this
subject
the
question
now
is
not
whether
lloyd
was
right
in
wishing
to
add
a
fourth
rank
armed
with
pikes
to
the

the
expectation
of
producing
more
effect
by
the
shock
when
attacking

opposing
a
greater
resistance

officer
of
experience
knows
the
difficulty
of
moving

manner
several
deployed

three
ranks
at
close
order

that
a
fourth
rank
would
increase
the
disorder
without
adding
any
advantage
it
is
astonishing
that
lloyd
who
had
seen
service
should
have
insisted
so
much
upon
the
material
advantage
to
be
gained
by
thus
increasing
the
mass
of
a
battalion
for
it
very
rarely
happens
that
such
a
collision
between
opposing
troops
takes
place
that
mere
weight
decides
the
contest
if
three
ranks
turn
their
backs
to
the
enemy
the
fourth
will
not
check
them
this
increase
in
the
number
of
ranks
diminishes
the
front
and
the
number
of
men
firing
upon
the
defensive
whilst
in
the
offensive
there
is
not
near
so
much
mobility
as
in
the
ordinary
column
of
attack
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
move
eight
hundred
men
in
line
of
battle
in
four
ranks
than
in
three
although
in
the
former
case
the
extent
of
front
is
less
the
ranks
can
not
be
kept
properly
closed
lloyd
proposal
for
remedying
this
diminution
of
front
is
so
absurd
that
it
is
wonderful
how
a
man
of
talents
could
have
imagined
it
he
wishes
to
deploy
twenty
battalions
and
leave
between
them
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
or
an
interval
equal
to
their
front
we
may
well
ask
what
would
befall
those
battalions
thus
separated
the
cavalry
may
penetrate
the
intervals
and
scatter
them
like
dust
before
the
whirlwind
but
the
real
question
now
is
shall
the
line
of
battle
consist
of
deployed
battalions
depending
chiefly
upon
their
fire
or
of
columns
of
attack
each
battalion
being
formed
in
column
on
the
central
division
and
depending
on
its
force
and
impetuosity
i
will
now
proceed
to
sum
up
the
particulars
bearing
upon
a
decision
of
the
question
in
hand
there
are
in
fact
only
five
methods
of
forming
troops
to
attack
an
enemy
l
as
skirmishers
in
deployed
lines
either
continuous
or
checkerwise
in
lines
of
battalions
formed
in
column
on
the
central
divisions
in
deep
masses
in
small
squares
the
is
an
accessory
for
the
duties
of
skirmishers
are
not
to
form
the
line
of
battle
but
to
cover
it
by
taking
advantage
of
the
ground
to
protect
the
movements
of
columns
to
fill
up
intervals
and
to
defend
the
skirts
of
a
position
these
different
manners
of
formation
are
therefore
reducible
to
four
the
shallow
order
where
the
line
is
deployed
in
three
ranks
the
order
formed
of
a
line
of
battalions
in
columns
doubled
on
the
center
or
in
battalion
squares
the
mixed
order
where
regiments
are
partly
in
line
and
partly
in
column
finally
the
deep
order
composed
of
heavy
columns
of
battalions
deployed
one
behind
the
other
illustration
fig
deployed
order
in
two
lines
the
formation
into
two
deployed
lines
with
a
reserve
was
formerly
used
to
a
great
extent
it
is
particularly
suitable
on
the
defensive
these
deployed
lines
may
either
be
continuous
fig
or
checkerwise
or
in
echelons
illustration
fig
twelve
battalions
in
columns
of
attack
in
two
lines
with
skirmishers
in
the
intervals
a
more
compact
order
is
shown
in
fig
where
each
battalion
is
formed
into
a
column
of
attack
being
by
divisions
upon
the
central
division
it
is
really
a
line
of
small
columns
in
the
formation
a
battalion
with
four
divisions
will
have
twelve
ranks
in
such
a
column
as
shown
above
there
are
in
this
way
too
many
and
the
column
presents
too
good
a
mark
for
the
artillery
to
remedy
in
part
these
inconveniences
it
has
been
proposed
whenever
infantry
is
employed
in
columns
of
attack
to
form
it
in
two
ranks
to
place
only
three
divisions
of
a
battalion
one
behind
the
other
and
to
spread
out
the
fourth
as
skirmishers
in
the
intervals
of
the
battalions
and
upon
the
flanks
when
the
cavalry
charges
these
skirmishers
may
rally
behind
the
other
three
divisions
see
fig
each
battalion
would
thus
have
two
hundred
more
men
to
fire
besides
those
thrown
into
the
two
front
ranks
from
the
third
there
would
be
also
an
increase
of
the
whole
front
by
this
arrangement
while
having
really
a
depth
of
but
six
men
there
would
be
a
front
of
one
hundred
men
and
four
hundred
men
who
could
discharge
their
for
each
battalion
force
and
mobility
would
both
be
obtained
a
battalion
of
eight
hundred
men
formed
in
the
ordinary
manner
in
a
column
of
four
divisions
has
about
sixty
files
in
each
division
of
which
the
first
alone
and
only
two
ranks
of
that
discharge
their
pieces
bach
battalion
would
deliver
therefore
one
hundred
and
twenty
shots
at
a
volley
whilst
formed
in
the
manner
shown
in
fig
it
would
deliver
four
hundred
illustration
fig
while
searching
after
methods
of
obtaining
more
fire
when
necessary
we
must
not
forget
that
a
column
of
attack
is
not
intended
to
fire
and
that
its
fire
should
be
reserved
until
the
last
for
if
it
begins
to
fire
while
marching
the
whole
impulsive
effect
of
its
forward
movement
is
lost
moreover
this
shallower
order
would
only
be
advantageous
against
infantry
as
the
column
of
four
divisions
in
three
ranks
forming
a
kind
of
solid
square
would
be
better
against
cavalry
the
archduke
charles
found
it
advantageous
at
essling
and
particularly
at
wagram
to
adopt
this
last
order
which
was
proposed
by
myself
in
my
chapter
on
the
general
principles
of
war
published
in
the
brave
cavalry
of
bessières
could
make
no
impression
upon
these
small
masses
to
give
more
solidity
to
the
column
proposed
the
skirmishers
might
it
is
true
be
recalled
and
the
fourth
division
reformed
but
this
would
be
a
formation
and
would
offer
much
less
resistance
to
a
charge
than
the
formation
particularly
on
the
flanks
if
to
remedy
this
inconvenience
it
is
proposed
to
form
squares
many
military
men
believe
that
when
in
two
ranks
squares
would
not
resist
so
well
as
columns
the
english
squares
at
waterloo
were
however
only
in
two
ranks
and
notwithstanding
the
heroic
efforts
of
the
french
cavalry
only
one
battalion
was
broken
i
will
observe
in
conclusion
that
if
the
formation
be
used
for
the
columns
of
attack
it
will
be
difficult
to
preserve
that
in
three
ranks
for
deployed
lines
as
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
have
two
methods
of
formation
or
at
any
rate
to
employ
them
alternately
in
the
same
engagement
it
is
not
probable
that
any
european
army
except
the
english
will
undertake
to
use
deployed
lines
in
two
ranks
if
they
do
they
should
never
move
except
in
columns
of
attack
i
conclude
that
the
system
employed
by
the
russians
and
prussians
of
forming
columns
of
four
divisions
in
three
ranks
of
which
one
may
be
employed
as
skirmishers
when
necessary
is
more
generally
applicable
than
any
other
whilst
the
other
of
which
mention
has
been
made
would
be
suitable
only
in
certain
cases
and
would
require
a
double
formation
illustration
fig
there
is
a
mixed
order
which
was
used
by
napoleon
at
the
tagliamento
and
by
the
russians
at
eylau
where
in
regiments
of
three
battalions
one
was
deployed
to
form
the
first
line
and
two
others
to
the
rear
in
columns
see
fig
this
arrangement
which
belongs
also
to
the
order
is
suitable
for
the
because
the
first
line
pours
a
powerful
fire
upon
the
enemy
which
must
throw
him
into
more
or
less
confusion
and
the
troops
formed
in
columns
may
debouch
through
the
intervals
and
fall
with
advantage
upon
him
while
in
disorder
this
arrangement
would
probably
be
improved
by
placing
the
leading
divisions
of
the
two
battalions
of
the
wings
upon
the
same
line
with
the
central
deployed
battalion
there
would
thus
be
a
more
to
each
regiment
in
the
first
line
a
by
no
means
unimportant
thing
for
the
delivery
of
fire
there
may
be
reason
to
fear
that
these
divisions
becoming
actively
engaged
in
firing
their
battalions
which
are
formed
in
column
to
be
readily
launched
against
the
enemy
may
not
be
easily
disengaged
for
that
purpose
the
order
may
be
useful
in
many
cases
i
have
therefore
indicated
it
illustration

fig
the
order
in
very
deep
masses
see
figs
and
is
certainly
the
most
injudicious
in
the
later
wars
of
napoleon
twelve
battalions
were
sometimes
deployed
and
closed
one
upon
the
other
forming
ranks
closely
packed
together
such
masses
are
greatly
exposed
to
the
destructive
effects
of
artillery
their
mobility
and
impulsion
are
diminished
while
their
strength
is
not
increased
the
use
of
such
masses
at
waterloo
was
one
cause
of
the
french
being
defeated
macdonald
column
was
more
fortunate
at
wagram
but
at
a
great
sacrifice
of
life
and
it
is
not
probable
that
this
column
would
have
been
victorious
had
it
not
been
for
the
successes
of
davoust
and
oudinot
on
the
left
of
the
archduke
line
when
it
is
decided
to
risk
such
a
mass
the
precaution
should
certainly
be
taken
of
placing
on
each
flank
a
battalion
marching
in
file
so
that
if
the
enemy
should
charge
the
mass
in
flank
it
need
not
be
arrested
in
its
progress
see
fig
under
the
protection
of
these
battalions
which
may
face
toward
the
enemy
the
column
may
continue
its
march
to
the
point
it
is
expected
to
reach
otherwise
this
large
mass
exposed
to
a
powerful
converging
fire
which
it
has
no
means
of
returning
will
be
thrown
into
confusion
like
the
column
at
fontenoy
or
broken
as
was
the
macedonian
phalanx
by
paulus
emilius
squares
are
good
in
plains
and
to
oppose
an
enemy
who
has
a
superiority
in
cavalry
it
is
agreed
that
the
regimental
square
is
best
for
the
defensive
and
the
battalion
square
for
the
offensive

squared
of
regiments
of

the
figures
may
be
perfect
squares
or
elongated
to
give
a
large
front
and
pour
a
heavier
column
of
fire
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
a
regiment
of
three
battalions
will
thus
form
a
long
square
by
wheeling
the
center
battalion
half
to
the
right
and
half
to
the
left
in
the
turkish
wars
squares
were
almost
exclusively
used
because
hostilities
were
carried
on
in
the
vast
plains
of
bessarabia
moldavia
or
wallachia
and
the
turks
had
an
immense
force
of
cavalry
but
if
the
seat
of
war
be
the
balkan
mountains
or
beyond
them
and
their
irregular
cavalry
be
replaced
by
an
army
organized
according
to
the
proportions
usual
in
europe
the
importance
of
the
square
will
disappear
and
the
russian
infantry
will
show
its
superiority
in
rumelia
however
this
may
be
the
order
in
squares
by
regiments
or
battalions
seems
suitable
for
every
kind
of
attack
when
the
assailant
has
not
the
superiority
in
cavalry
and
maneuvers
on
level
ground
advantageous
for
the
enemy
charges
the
elongated
square
especially
when
applied
to
a
battalion
of
eight
companies
three
of
which
would
march
in
front
and
one
on
each
side
would
be
much
better
to
make
an
attack
than
a
deployed
battalion
it
would
not
be
so
good
as
the
column
proposed
above
but
there
would
be
less
unsteadiness
and
more
impulsion
than
if
the
battalion
marched
in
a
deployed
line
it
would
have
the
advantage
also
of
being
prepared
to
resist
cavalry
squares
may
also
be
drawn
up
in
echelons
so
as
entirely
to
unmask
each
other
all
the
orders
of
battle
may
be
formed
of
squares
as
well
as
with
deployed
lines
it
can
not
be
stated
with
truth
that
any
one
of
the
formations
described
is
always
good
or
always
bad
but
there
is
one
rule
to
the
correctness
of
which
every
one
will
assent
that
a
formation
suitable
for
the
offensive
must
possess
the
characteristics
of
and
whilst
for
the
defensive
is
requisite
and
also
the
power
of
delivering
much
fire
as
this
truth
being
admitted
it
remains
yet
to
be
decided
whether
the
bravest
troops
formed
in
columns
but
unable
to
fire
can
stand
long
in
presence
of
a
deployed
line
firing
twenty
thousand
in
one
round
and
able
to
fire
two
hundred
thousand
or
three
hundred
thousand
in
five
minutes
in
the
later
wars
in
europe
positions
have
often
been
carried
by
russian
french
and
prussian
columns
with
their
arms
at
a
shoulder
and
without
firing
a
shot
this
was
a
triumph
of
and
the
moral
effect
it
produces
but
under
the
cool
and
deadly
fire
of
the
english
infantry
the
french
columns
did
not
succeed
so
well
at
talavera
busaco
albuera
and
waterloo
we
must
not
however
necessarily
conclude
from
these
facts
that
the
advantage
is
entirely
in
favor
of
the
shallow
formation
and
firing
for
when
the
french
formed
their
infantry
in
those
dense
masses
it
is
not
at
all
wonderful
that
the
deployed
and
marching
battalions
of
which
they
were
composed
assailed
on
all
sides
by
a
deadly
fire
should
have
been
repulsed
would
the
same
result
have
been
witnessed
if
they
had
used
columns
of
attack
formed
each
of
a
single
battalion
doubled
on
the
center
i
think
not
before
deciding
finally
as
to
the
superiority
of
the
shallow
order
with
its
facility
for
firing
over
the
order
and
its
momentum
there
should
be
several
trials
to
see
how
a
deployed
line
would
stand
an
assault
from
a
formation
like
fig
page
these
small
columns
have
always
succeeded
wherever
i
have
seen
them
tried
is
it
indeed
an
easy
matter
to
adopt
any
other
order
when
marching
to
attack
a
position
can
an
immense
deployed
line
be
moved
up
into
action
while
firing
i
think
no
one
will
answer
affirmatively
suppose
the
attempt
made
to
bring
up
twenty
or
thirty
battalions
in
line
while
firing
either
by
file
or
by
company
to
the
assault
of
a
position
it
is
not
very
probable
they
would
ever
reach
the
desired
point
or
if
they
did
it
would
be
in
about
as
good
order
as
a
flock
of
sheep
what
conclusions
shall
be
drawn
from
all
that
has
been
said
if
the
deep
order
is
dangerous
the
is
excellent
for
the
offensive
the
column
of
attack
of
single
battalions
is
the
best
formation
for
carrying
a
position
by
assault
but
its
depth
should
be
diminished
as
much
as
possible
that
it
may
when
necessary
be
able
to
deliver
as
heavy
a
column
of
fire
as
possible
and
to
diminish
the
effect
of
the
fire
it
ought
also
to
be
well
covered
by
skirmishers
and
supported
by
cavalry
the
formation
having
the
first
line
deployed
and
the
second
in
columns
is
the
to
the
defensive
either
of
them
may
be
successful
in
the
hands
of
a
general
of
talent
who
knows
how
to
use
his
troops
properly
in
the
manner
indicated
in
articles
xvi
and
xxx
since
this
chapter
was
first
written
numerous
improvements
have
been
made
in
the
arms
both
of
infantry
and
artillery
making
them
much
more
destructive
the
effect
of
this
is
to
incline
men
to
prefer
the
shallower
formations
even
in
the
attack
we
can
not
however
forget
the
lessons
of
experience
and
notwithstanding
the
use
of
and
the
perkins
musket
i
can
not
imagine
a
better
method
of
forming
infantry
for
the
attack
than
in
columns
of
battalions
some
persons
may
perhaps
desire
to
restore
to
infantry
the
helmets
and
breastplates
of
the
fifteenth
century
before
leading
them
to
the
attack
in
deployed
lines
but
if
there
is
a
general
return
to
the
deployed
system
some
better
arrangement
must
be
devised
for
marching
to
the
attack
than
long
continuous
lines
and
either
columns
must
be
used
with
proper
distances
for
deployment
upon
arriving
near
the
enemy
position
or
lines
drawn
up
checkerwise
or
the
march
must
be
by
the
flanks
of
companies
all
of
which
maneuvers
are
hazardous
in
presence
of
an
enemy
who
is
capable
of
profiting
by
the
advantages
on
his
side
a
skillful
commander
will
use
either
or
a
combination
of
all
of
these
arrangements
according
to
circumstances
experience
long
ago
taught
me
that
one
of
the
most
difficult
tactical
problems
is
that
of
determining
the
best
formation
of
troops
for
battle
but
i
have
also
learned
that
to
solve
this
problem
by
the
use
of
a
single
method
is
an
impossibility
in
the
first
place
the
topography
of
different
countries
is
very
various
in
some
as
champagne
two
hundred
thousand
men
might
be
maneuvered
in
deployed
lines
in
others
as
italy
switzerland
the
valley
of
the
rhine
half
of
hungary
it
is
barely
possible
to
deploy
a
division
of
ten
battalions
the
degree
of
instruction
of
the
troops
and
their
national
characteristics
may
also
have
an
influence
upon
the
system
of
formation
owing
to
the
thorough
discipline
of
the
russian
army
and
its
instruction
in
maneuvers
of
every
kind
it
may
maintain
in
movements
in
long
lines
so
much
order
and
steadiness
as
to
enable
it
to
adopt
a
system
which
would
be
entirely
out
of
the
question
for
the
french
or
prussian
armies
of
the
present
day
my
long
experience
has
taught
me
to
believe
that
nothing
is
impossible
and
i
do
not
belong
to
the
class
of
men
who
think
that
there
can
be
but
one
type
and
one
system
for
all
armies
and
all
countries
to
approximate
as
nearly
as
we
can
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
we
ought
to
find
out
the
best
method
of
moving
when
in
sight
of
the
enemy
but
beyond
his
reach
the
best
method
of
coming
to
close
quarters
with
him
the
best
defensive
order
in
whatever
manner
we
may
settle
these
points
it
seems
desirable
in
all
cases
to
exercise
the
troops
in
marching
in
columns
of
battalions
doubled
on
the
center
with
a
view
to
deployment
if
necessary
when
coming
into
or
even
to
attack
in
column
in
marching
in
continuous
deployed
lines
of
eight
or
ten
battalions
in
marching
in
deployed
battalions
arranged
checkerwise
as
these
broken
lines
are
more
easily
moved
than
continuous
lines
in
moving
to
the
front
by
the
flanks
of
companies
in
marching
to
the
front
in
small
squares
either
in
line
or
checkerwise
in
changing
front
while
using
these
different
methods
of
marching
in
changes
of
front
executed
by
columns
of
companies
at
full
distance
without
deployment
a
more
expeditious
method
than
the
others
of
changing
front
and
the
one
best
suited
to
all
kinds
of
ground
of
all
the
methods
of
moving
to
the
front
that
by
the
flanks
of
companies
would
be
the
best
if
it
was
not
somewhat
dangerous
in
a
plain
it
succeeds
admirably
and
in
broken
ground
is
very
convenient
it
breaks
up
a
line
very
much
but
by
accustoming
the
officers
and
privates
to
it
and
by
keeping
the
guides
and
well
aligned
all
confusion
can
be
avoided
the
only
objection
to
it
is
the
danger
to
which
the
separated
companies
are
exposed
of
being
ridden
down
by
cavalry
this
danger
may
be
avoided
by
having
good
cavalry
scouts
and
not
using
this
formation
too
near
the
enemy
but
only
in
getting
over
the
first
part
of
the
large
interval
separating
the
two
armies
at
the
least
sign
of
the
enemy
proximity
the
line
could
be
reformed
instantly
since
the
companies
can
come
into
line
at
a
run
whatever
precautions
may
be
taken
this
maneuver
should
only
be
practiced
with
troops
never
with
militia
or
raw
troops
i
have
never
seen
it
tried
in
presence
of
an
enemy
but
frequently
at
drills
where
it
has
been
found
to
succeed
well
especially
in
changing
front
i
have
also
seen
attempts
made
to
march
deployed
battalions
in
checkerwise
order
they
succeeded
well
whilst
marches
of
the
same
battalions
in
continuous
lines
did
not
the
french
particularly
have
never
been
able
to
march
steadily
in
deployed
lines
this
checkered
order
would
be
dangerous
in
case
of
an
unexpected
charge
of
cavalry
it
may
be
employed
in
the
first
stages
of
the
movement
forward
to
make
it
more
easy
and
the
rear
battalions
would
then
come
into
line
with
the
leading
ones
before
reaching
the
enemy
moreover
it
is
easy
to
form
line
at
the
moment
of
the
charge
by
leaving
a
small
distance
only
between
the
leading
and
following
battalions
for
we
must
not
forget
that
in
the
checkered
order
there
are
not
two
lines
but
a
single
one
which
is
broken
to
avoid
the
wavering
and
disorder
observed
in
the
marches
of
continuous
lines
it
is
very
difficult
to
determine
positively
the
best
formation
for
making
a
serious
and
close
attack
upon
an
enemy
of
all
the
methods
i
have
seen
tried
the
following
seemed
to
succeed
best
form
battalions
in
two
lines
of
battalions
in
columns
doubled
on
the
center
ready
for
deployment
the
first
line
will
advance
at
toward
the
enemy
line
to
within
twice
and
will
then
deploy
at
a
run
the
of
each
battalion
will
spread
out
in
the
remaining
companies
forming
line
and
pouring
in
a
continued
fire
by
file
the
second
line
of
columns
follows
the
first
and
the
battalions
composing
it
pass
at
through
the
intervals
of
the
first
line
this
maneuver
was
executed
when
no
enemy
was
present
but
it
seems
to
me
an
irresistible
combination
of
the
advantages
of
firing
and
of
the
column
besides
these
lines
of
columns
there
are
three
other
methods
of
attacking
in
the
order
the
first
is
that
of
lines
composed
of
deployed
battalions
with
others
in
column
on
the
wings
of
those
deployed
fig
page
the
deployed
battalions
and
the
leading
divisions
of
those
in
column
would
open
fire
at
half
and
the
assault
would
then
be
made
the
second
is
that
of
advancing
a
deployed
line
and
firing
until
reaching
half
then
throwing
forward
the
columns
of
the
second
line
through
the
intervals
of
the
first
the
third
is
the
order
in
echelons
mentioned
on
page
and
shown
in
fig
on
that
page
finally
a
last
method
is
that
of
advancing
altogether
in
deployed
lines
depending
on
the
superiority
of
fire
alone
until
one
or
the
other
party
takes
to
its
heels
a
case
not
likely
to
happen
i
can
not
affirm
positively
which
of
these
methods
is
the
best
for
i
have
not
seen
them
used
in
actual
service
in
fact
in
real
combats
of
infantry
i
have
never
seen
any
thing
but
battalions
deployed
commencing
to
fire
by
company
and
finally
by
file
or
else
columns
marching
firmly
against
the
enemy
who
either
retired
without
awaiting
the
columns
or
repulsed
them
before
an
actual
collision
took
place
or
themselves
moved
out
to
meet
the
advance
i
have
seen
of
infantry
in
defiles
and
in
villages
where
the
heads
of
columns
came
in
actual
bodily
collision
and
thrust
each
other
with
the
bayonet
but
i
never
saw
such
a
thing
on
a
regular
field
of
battle
in
whatever
manner
these
discussions
terminate
they
are
useful
and
should
be
continued
it
would
be
absurd
to
discard
as
useless
the
fire
of
infantry
as
it
would
be
to
give
up
entirely
the
formation
and
an
army
is
ruined
if
forced
to
adhere
to
precisely
the
same
style
of
tactical
maneuvers
in
every
country
it
may
enter
and
against
every
different
nation
it
is
not
so
much
the
mode
of
formation
as
the
proper
combined
use
of
the
different
arms
which
will
insure
victory
i
must
however
except
very
deep
masses
as
they
should
be
entirely
abandoned
i
will
conclude
this
subject
by
stating
that
a
most
vital
point
to
be
attended
to
in
leading
infantry
to
the
combat
is
to
protect
the
troops
as
much
as
possible
from
the
fire
of
the
enemy
artillery
not
by
withdrawing
them
at
inopportune
moments
but
by
taking
advantage
of
all
inequalities
and
accidents
of
the
ground
to
hide
them
from
the
view
of
the
enemy
when
the
assaulting
troops
have
arrived
within
it
is
useless
to
calculate
upon
sheltering
them
longer
the
assault
is
then
to
be
made
in
such
cases
covers
are
only
suitable
for
skirmishers
and
troops
on
the
defensive
it
is
generally
quite
important
to
defend
villages
on
the
front
of
a
position
or
to
endeavor
to
take
them
when
held
by
an
enemy
who
is
assailed
but
their
importance
should
not
be
overestimated
for
we
must
never
forget
the
noted
battle
of
blenheim
where
marlborough
and
eugene
seeing
the
mass
of
the
french
infantry
shut
up
in
the
villages
broke
through
the
center
and
captured
battalions
which
were
sacrificed
in
defending
these
posts
for
like
reasons
it
is
useful
to
occupy
clumps
of
trees
or
brushwood
which
may
afford
cover
to
the
party
holding
them
they
shelter
the
troops
conceal
their
movements
cover
those
of
cavalry
and
prevent
the
enemy
from
maneuvering
in
their
neighborhood
the
case
of
the
park
of
hougoumont
at
the
battle
of
waterloo
is
a
fine
example
of
the
influence
the
possession
of
such
a
position
well
chosen
and
strongly
defended
may
have
in
deciding
the
fate
of
a
battle
at
hochkirch
and
kolin
the
possession
of
the
woods
was
very
important

in
this
and
subsequent
figures

suppose
a
division

twelve
battalions

used
to
designate
four
or
five
regiments

well
as
two

confusion

its

footnote
in

the

are
taken
from
the
third
rank

makes
the

eight

of
twelve

gives
more

columns
it
would
be
perhaps
better
to
take
the
whole
fourth

giving
nine

the
use
a
general
should
make
of
his
cavalry
depends
of
course
somewhat
upon
its
numerical
strength
as
compared
with
that
of
the
whole
army
and
upon
its
quality
even
cavalry
of
an
inferior
character
may
be
so
handled
as
to
produce
very
great
results
if
set
in
action
at
proper
moments
the
numerical
proportion
of
cavalry
to
infantry
in
armies
has
varied
greatly
it
depends
on
the
natural
tastes
of
nations
making
their
people
more
or
less
fit
for
good
troopers
the
number
and
quality
of
horses
also
have
something
to
do
with
it
in
the
wars
of
the
revolution
the
french
cavalry
although
badly
organized
and
greatly
inferior
to
the
austrian
performed
wonders
in
i
saw
what
was
pompously
called
the
cavalry
reserve
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
a
weak
brigade
of
barely
fifteen
hundred
horses
ten
years
later
i
saw
the
same
reserve
consisting
of
fifteen
thousand
or
twenty
thousand
horses
so
much
had
ideas
and
means
changed
as
a
general
rule
it
may
be
stated
that
an
army
in
an
open
country
should
contain
cavalry
to
the
amount
of
its
whole
strength
in
mountainous
countries
will
suffice
the
principal
value
of
cavalry
is
derived
from
its
rapidity
and
ease
of
motion
to
these
characteristics
may
be
added
its
impetuosity
but
we
must
be
careful
lest
a
false
application
be
made
of
this
last
whatever
may
be
its
importance
in
the
of
the
operations
of
war
cavalry
can
never
defend
a
position
without
the
support
of
infantry
its
chief
duty
is
to
open
the
way
for
gaining
a
victory
or
to
render
it
complete
by
carrying
off
prisoners
and
trophies
pursuing
the
enemy
rapidly
succoring
a
threatened
point
overthrowing
disordered
infantry
covering
retreats
of
infantry
and
artillery
an
army
deficient
in
cavalry
rarely
obtains
a
great
victory
and
finds
its
retreats
extremely
difficult
the
proper
time
and
manner
of
bringing
cavalry
into
action
depend
upon
the
ideas
of
the
the
plan
of
the
battle
the
movements
and
a
thousand
other
circumstances
which
can
not
be
mentioned
here
i
can
only
touch
upon
the
principal
things
to
be
considered
in
its
use
all
are
agreed
that
a
general
attack
of
cavalry
against
a
line
in
good
order
can
not
be
attempted
with
much
hope
of
success
unless
it
be
supported
by
infantry
and
artillery
at
waterloo
the
french
paid
dearly
for
having
violated
this
rule
and
the
cavalry
of
frederick
the
great
fared
no
better
at
kunnersdorf
a
commander
may
sometimes
feel
obliged
to
push
his
cavalry
forward
alone
but
generally
the
best
time
for
charging
a
line
of
infantry
is
when
it
is
already
engaged
with
opposing
infantry
the
battles
of
marengo
eylau
borodino
and
several
others
prove
this
there
is
one
case
in
which
cavalry
has
a
very
decided
superiority
over
infantry
when
rain
or
snow
dampens
the
arms
of
the
latter
and
they
can
not
fire
augereau
corps
found
this
out
to
their
sorrow
at
eylau
and
so
did
the
austrian
left
at
dresden
infantry
that
has
been
shaken
by
a
fire
of
artillery
or
in
any
other
way
may
be
charged
with
success
a
very
remarkable
charge
of
this
kind
was
made
by
the
prussian
cavalry
at
hohenfriedberg
in
a
charge
against
squares
of
good
infantry
in
good
order
can
not
succeed
a
general
cavalry
charge
is
made
to
carry
batteries
of
artillery
and
enable
the
infantry
to
take
the
position
more
easily
but
the
infantry
must
then
be
at
hand
to
sustain
the
cavalry
for
a
charge
of
this
character
has
only
a
momentary
effect
which
must
be
taken
advantage
of
before
the
enemy
can
return
offensively
upon
the
broken
cavalry
the
beautiful
charge
of
the
french
upon
gosa
at
the
battle
of
leipsic
october
is
a
fine
example
of
this
kind
those
executed
at
waterloo
with
the
same
object
in
view
were
admirable
but
failed
because
unsupported
the
daring
charge
of
ney
weak
cavalry
upon
prince
hohenlohe
artillery
at
jena
is
an
example
of
what
may
be
done
under
such
circumstances
general
charges
are
also
made
against
the
enemy
cavalry
to
drive
it
from
the
field
of
battle
and
return
more
free
to
act
against
his
infantry
cavalry
may
be
successfully
thrown
against
the
flank
or
rear
of
an
enemy
line
at
the
moment
of
its
being
attacked
in
front
by
the
infantry
if
repulsed
it
may
rally
upon
the
army
at
a
gallop
and
if
successful
it
may
cause
the
loss
of
the
enemy
army
this
operation
is
rarely
attempted
but
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
very
good
for
a
body
of
cavalry
well
handled
can
not
be
cut
off
even
if
it
gets
in
rear
of
the
enemy
this
is
a
duty
for
which
light
cavalry
is
particularly
fitted
in
the
defensive
cavalry
may
also
produce
very
valuable
results
by
opportune
dashes
at
a
body
of
the
enemy
which
has
engaged
the
opposing
line
and
either
broken
it
through
or
been
on
the
point
of
doing
so
it
may
regain
the
advantages
lost
change
the
face
of
affairs
and
cause
the
destruction
of
an
enemy
flushed
and
disordered
by
his
own
success
this
was
proved
at
eylau
where
the
russians
made
a
fine
charge
and
at
waterloo
by
the
english
cavalry
the
special
cavalry
of
a
corps
may
charge
at
opportune
moments
either
to
in
a
combined
attack
or
to
take
advantage
of
a
false
movement
of
the
enemy
or
to
finish
his
defeat
by
pressing
him
while
in
retreat
it
is
not
an
easy
matter
to
determine
the
best
mode
of
attacking
as
it
depends
upon
the
object
in
view
and
other
circumstances
there
are
but
four
methods
of
charging
in
columns
in
lines
at
a
trot
in
lines
at
a
gallop
and
in
open
order
all
of
which
may
be
successfully
used
in
charges
in
line
the
lance
is
very
useful
in
the
saber
is
much
better
hence
comes
the
idea
of
giving
the
lance
to
the
front
rank
which
makes
the
first
onslaught
and
the
saber
to
the
second
rank
which
finishes
the
encounter
usually
in
individual
combats
is
of
very
little
use
except
for
in
a
charge
as
foragers
or
when
light
cavalry
desires
to
annoy
infantry
and
draw
its
fire
previous
to
a
charge
i
do
not
know
what
the
carbine
is
good
for
since
a
body
of
cavalry
armed
with
it
must
halt
if
they
wish
to
fire
with
any
accuracy
and
they
are
then
in
a
favorable
condition
for
the
enemy
to
attack
there
are
few
marksmen
who
can
with
any
accuracy
fire
a
musket
while
on
horseback
and
in
rapid
motion
i
have
just
said
that
all
the
methods
of
charging
may
be
equally
good
it
must
not
be
understood
however
that
impetuosity
always
gives
the
advantage
in
a
shock
of
cavalry
against
cavalry
the
fast
trot
on
the
contrary
seems
to
me
the
best
gait
for
charges
in
line
because
every
thing
depends
in
such
a
case
upon
the
and
good
order
of
the
movement
things
which
can
not
be
obtained
in
charges
at
a
fast
gallop
galloping
is
proper
against
artillery
when
it
is
important
to
get
over
the
ground
as
rapidly
as
possible
in
like
manner
if
the
cavalry
is
armed
with
sabers
it
may
take
the
gallop
at
two
hundred
yards
from
the
enemy
line
if
it
stands
firmly
to
receive
the
attack
but
if
the
cavalry
is
armed
with
the
lance
the
fast
trot
is
the
proper
gait
since
the
advantageous
use
of
that
weapon
depends
upon
the
preservation
of
good
order
in
a
the
lance
is
almost
useless
if
the
enemy
advances
at
a
fast
trot
it
does
not
seem
prudent
to
gallop
to
meet
him
for
the
galloping
party
will
be
much
disordered
while
the
trotting
party
will
not
the
only
advantage
of
the
gallop
is
its
apparent
boldness
and
the
moral
effect
it
produces
but
if
this
is
estimated
at
its
true
value
by
the
enemy
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
his
firm
and
compact
mass
to
be
victorious
over
a
body
of
horsemen
galloping
in
confusion
in
their
charges
against
infantry
the
turks
and
mamelukes
showed
the
small
advantage
of
mere
impetuosity
no
cavalry
will
penetrate
where
lancers
or
cuirassiers
at
a
trot
can
not
it
is
only
when
infantry
is
much
disordered
or
their
fire
poorly
maintained
that
there
is
any
advantage
in
the
impetuous
gallop
over
the
steady
trot
to
break
good
squares
cannon
and
lancers
are
required
or
better
still
cuirassiers
armed
with
lances
for
charges
in
open
order
there
are
no
better
models
for
imitation
than
the
turks
and
the
cossacks
whatever
method
be
adopted
in
charging
one
of
the
best
ways
of
using
cavalry
is
to
throw
several
squadrons
opportunely
upon
the
flanks
of
an
enemy
line
which
is
also
attacked
in
front
that
this
maneuver
may
be
completely
successful
especially
in
charges
of
cavalry
against
cavalry
it
should
be
performed
at
the
very
moment
when
the
lines
come
in
collision
for
a
minute
too
soon
or
too
late
its
effect
may
be
lost
it
is
highly
important
therefore
that
a
cavalry
commander
should
have
a
quick
eye
sound
judgment
and
a
cool
head
much
discussion
has
taken
place
about
the
proper
manner
of
arming
and
organizing
cavalry
the
lance
is
the
best
arm
for
offensive
purposes
when
a
body
of
horsemen
charge
in
line
for
it
enables
them
to
strike
an
enemy
who
can
not
reach
them
but
it
is
a
very
good
plan
to
have
a
second
rank
or
a
reserve
armed
with
sabers
which
are
more
easily
handled
than
the
lance
in
fighting
when
the
ranks
become
broken
it
would
be
perhaps
better
still
to
support
a
charge
of
lancers
by
a
detachment
of
hussars
who
can
follow
up
the
charge
penetrate
the
enemy
line
and
complete
the
victory
the
cuirass
is
the
best
defensive
armor
the
lance
and
the
cuirass
of
strong
leather
doubled
seem
to
me
the
best
armament
for
light
cavalry
the
saber
and
iron
cuirass
the
best
for
heavy
cavalry
some
military
men
of
experience
are
inclined
even
to
arm
the
cuirassiers
with
lances
believing
that
such
cavalry
resembling
very
much
the
of
former
days
would
bear
down
every
thing
before
them
a
lance
would
certainly
suit
them
better
than
the
musketoon
and
i
do
not
see
why
they
should
not
have
lances
like
those
of
the
light
cavalry
opinions
will
be
always
divided
as
to
those
amphibious
animals
called
dragoons
it
is
certainly
an
advantage
to
have
several
battalions
of
mounted
infantry
who
can
anticipate
an
enemy
at
a
defile
defend
it
in
retreat
or
scour
a
wood
but
to
make
cavalry
out
of
or
a
soldier
who
is
equally
good
on
horse
or
on
foot
is
very
difficult
this
might
have
been
supposed
settled
by
the
fate
of
the
french
dragoons
when
fighting
on
foot
had
it
not
been
seen
that
the
turkish
cavalry
fought
quite
as
well
dismounted
as
mounted
it
has
been
said
that
the
greatest
inconvenience
resulting
from
the
use
of
dragoons
consists
in
the
fact
of
being
obliged
at
one
moment
to
make
them
believe
infantry
squares
can
not
resist
their
charges
and
the
next
moment
that
a
armed
with
his
musket
is
superior
to
any
horseman
in
the
world
this
argument
has
more
plausibility
than
real
force
for
instead
of
attempting
to
make
men
believe
such
contradictory
statements
it
would
be
much
more
reasonable
to
tell
them
that
if
brave
cavalry
may
break
a
square
brave
may
resist
such
a
charge
that
victory
does
not
always
depend
upon
the
superiority
of
the
arm
but
upon
a
thousand
other
things
that
the
courage
of
the
troops
the
presence
of
mind
of
the
commanders
the
opportuneness
of
maneuvers
the
effect
of
artillery
and
musketry
fire
rain
mud
even
have
been
the
causes
of
repulses
or
of
victories
and
finally
that
a
brave
man
whether
on
foot
or
mounted
will
always
be
more
than
a
match
for
a
coward
by
impressing
these
truths
upon
dragoons
they
will
believe
themselves
superior
to
their
adversaries
whether
they
fight
on
foot
or
on
horseback
this
is
the
case
with
the
turks
and
the
circassians
whose
cavalry
often
dismount
to
fight
on
foot
in
a
wood
or
behind
a
cover
musket
in
hand
like
it
requires
however
fine
material
and
fine
commanders
to
bring
soldiers
to
such
perfection
in
knowledge
of
their
duties
the
conviction
of
what
brave
men
can
accomplish
whether
on
foot
or
mounted
doubtless
induced
the
emperor
nicholas
to
collect
the
large
number
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
thousand
dragoons
in
a
single
corps
while
he
did
not
consider
napoleon
unfortunate
experiment
with
french
dragoons
and
was
not
restrained
by
the
fear
of
often
wanting
a
regiment
of
these
troops
at
some
particular
point
it
is
probable
that
this
concentration
was
ordered
for
the
purpose
of
giving
uniformity
to
the
instruction
of
the
men
in
their
duties
as
foot
and
mounted
soldiers
and
that
in
war
they
were
to
be
distributed
to
the
different
grand
divisions
of
the
army
it
can
not
be
denied
however
that
great
advantages
might
result
to
the
general
who
could
rapidly
move
up
ten
thousand
men
on
horseback
to
a
decisive
point
and
bring
them
into
action
as
infantry
it
thus
appears
that
the
methods
of
concentration
and
of
distribution
have
their
respective
advantages
and
disadvantages
a
judicious
mean
between
the
extremes
would
be
to
attach
a
strong
regiment
to
each
wing
of
the
army
and
to
the
advanced
guard
or
the
in
a
retreat
and
then
to
unite
the
remaining
troops
of
this
arm
in
divisions
or
corps
every
thing
that
was
said
with
reference
to
the
formation
of
infantry
is
applicable
to
cavalry
with
the
following
modifications
lines
deployed
checkerwise
or
in
echelons
are
much
better
for
cavalry
than
full
lines
whilst
for
infantry
lines
drawn
up
checkerwise
are
too
much
disconnected
and
would
be
in
danger
if
the
cavalry
should
succeed
in
penetrating
and
taking
the
battalions
in
flank
the
checkerwise
formation
is
only
advantageous
for
infantry
in
preparatory
movements
before
reaching
the
enemy
or
else
for
lines
of
columns
which
can
defend
themselves
in
every
direction
against
cavalry
whether
checkered
or
full
lines
be
used
the
distance
between
them
ought
to
be
such
that
if
one
is
checked
and
thrown
into
confusion
the
others
may
not
share
it
it
is
well
to
observe
that
in
the
checkered
lines
the
distance
may
be
less
than
for
full
lines
in
every
case
the
second
line
should
not
be
full
it
should
be
formed
in
columns
by
divisions
or
at
least
there
should
be
left
the
spaces
if
in
line
of
two
squadrons
that
may
be
in
column
upon
the
flank
of
each
regiment
to
facilitate
the
passage
through
of
the
troops
which
have
been
brought
up
when
the
order
of
columns
of
attack
doubled
on
the
center
is
used
cavalry
should
be
formed
in
regiments
and
infantry
only
in
battalions
the
regiments
should
contain
six
squadrons
in
order
that
by
doubling
on
the
center
into
divisions
three
may
be
formed
if
there
are
only
four
squadrons
there
can
be
but
two
lines
the
cavalry
column
of
attack
should
never
be
formed
like
that
of
infantry
but
there
should
always
be
full
or
half
squadron
distance
that
each
may
have
room
to
disengage
itself
and
charge
separately
this
distance
will
be
so
great
only
for
those
troops
engaged
when
they
are
at
rest
behind
the
line
of
battle
they
may
be
closed
up
in
order
to
cover
less
ground
and
diminish
the
space
to
be
passed
over
when
brought
into
action
the
masses
should
of
course
be
kept
beyond
a
flank
attack
being
much
more
to
be
apprehended
by
cavalry
than
in
a
combat
of
infantry
with
infantry
several
squadrons
should
be
formed
in
echelons
by
platoons
on
the
flanks
of
a
line
of
cavalry
which
may
form
to
the
right
or
left
to
meet
an
enemy
coming
in
that
direction
for
the
same
reason
it
is
important
to
throw
several
squadrons
against
the
flanks
of
a
line
of
cavalry
which
is
attacked
in
front
irregular
cavalry
is
quite
as
good
as
the
regular
for
this
purpose
and
it
may
be
better
it
is
also
of
importance
especially
in
cavalry
that
the
increase
the
depth
rather
than
the
extent
of
the
formation
for
example
in
a
deployed
division
of
two
brigades
it
would
not
be
a
good
plan
for
one
brigade
to
form
in
a
single
line
behind
the
other
but
each
brigade
should
have
one
regiment
in
the
first
line
and
one
in
the
second
each
unit
of
the
line
will
thus
have
its
own
proper
reserve
behind
it
an
advantage
not
to
be
regarded
as
trifling
for
in
a
charge
events
succeed
each
other
so
rapidly
that
it
is
impossible
for
a
general
to
control
the
deployed
regiments
by
adopting
this
arrangement
each
general
of
brigade
will
be
able
to
dispose
of
his
own
reserve
and
it
would
be
well
also
to
have
a
general
reserve
for
the
whole
division
this
consideration
leads
me
to
think
that
five
regiments
would
make
a
good
division
the
charge
may
then
be
made
in
line
by
brigades
of
two
regiments
the
fifth
serving
as
a
general
reserve
behind
the
center
or
three
regiments
may
form
the
line
and
two
may
be
in
column
one
behind
each
wing
or
it
may
be
preferable
to
use
a
mixed
order
deploying
two
regiments
and
keeping
the
others
in
column
this
is
a
good
arrangement
because
the
three
regiments
formed
in
columns
by
divisions
behind
the
center
and
flanks
of
the
line
cover
those
points
and
can
readily
pass
the
line
if
it
is
beaten
back
see
fig
illustration
fig
cavalry
division
of
five
regiments
cavalry
deployed
should
be
in
checkered
order
rather
than
in
full
lines
two
essential
points
are
regarded
as
generally
settled
for
all
encounters
of
cavalry
against
cavalry
one
is
that
the
first
line
must
sooner
or
later
be
checked
for
even
upon
the
supposition
of
the
first
charge
being
entirely
successful
it
is
always
probable
that
the
enemy
will
bring
fresh
squadrons
to
the
contest
and
the
first
line
must
at
length
be
forced
to
rally
behind
the
second
the
other
point
is
that
with
troops
and
commanders
on
both
sides
equally
good
the
victory
will
remain
with
the
party
having
the
last
squadrons
in
reserve
in
readiness
to
be
thrown
upon
the
flank
of
the
enemy
line
while
his
front
is
also
engaged
attention
to
these
truths
will
bring
us
to
a
just
conclusion
as
to
the
proper
method
of
forming
a
large
mass
of
cavalry
for
battle
whatever
order
be
adopted
care
must
be
taken
to
avoid
deploying
large
cavalry
corps
in
full
lines
for
a
mass
thus
drawn
up
is
very
unmanageable
and
if
the
first
line
is
checked
suddenly
in
its
career
the
second
is
also
and
that
without
having
an
opportunity
to
strike
a
blow
this
has
been
demonstrated
many
times
take
as
an
example
the
attack
made
by
nansouty
in
columns
of
regiments
upon
the
prussian
cavalry
deployed
in
front
of
in
opposing
the
formation
of
cavalry
in
more
than
two
lines
i
never
intended
to
exclude
the
use
of
several
lines
checkerwise
or
in
echelons
or
of
reserves
formed
in
columns
i
only
meant
to
say
that
when
cavalry
expecting
to
make
a
charge
is
drawn
up
in
lines
one
behind
the
other
the
whole
mass
will
be
thrown
into
confusion
as
soon
as
the
first
line
breaks
and
turns
with
cavalry
still
more
than
with
infantry
the
is
very
important
the
quickness
of
eye
and
the
coolness
of
the
commander
and
the
intelligence
and
bravery
of
the
soldier
whether
in
the
or
in
the
rally
will
oftener
be
the
means
of
assuring
a
victory
than
the
adoption
of
this
or
that
formation
when
however
a
good
formation
is
adopted
and
the
advantages
mentioned
above
are
also
present
the
victory
is
more
certain
and
nothing
can
excuse
the
use
of
a
vicious
formation
the
history
of
the
wars
between
and
has
renewed
the
old
disputes
upon
the
question
whether
regular
cavalry
will
in
the
end
get
the
better
over
an
irregular
cavalry
which
will
avoid
all
serious
encounters
will
retreat
with
the
speed
of
the
parthians
and
return
to
the
combat
with
the
same
rapidity
wearing
out
the
strength
of
its
enemy
by
continual
skirmishing
lloyd
has
decided
in
the
negative
and
several
exploits
of
the
cossacks
when
engaged
with
the
excellent
french
cavalry
seem
to
confirm
his
opinion
when
i
speak
of
excellent
french
cavalry
i
refer
to
its
impetuous
bravery
and
not
to
its
perfection
for
it
does
not
compare
with
the
russian
or
german
cavalry
either
in
horsemanship
organization
or
in
care
of
the
animals
we
must
by
no
means
conclude
it
possible
for
a
body
of
light
cavalry
deployed
as
skirmishers
to
accomplish
as
much
as
the
cossacks
or
other
irregular
cavalry
they
acquire
a
habit
of
moving
in
an
apparently
disorderly
manner
whilst
they
are
all
the
time
directing
their
individual
efforts
toward
a
common
object
the
most
practiced
hussars
can
never
perform
such
service
as
the
cossacks
tscherkesses
and
turks
do
instinctively
experience
has
shown
that
irregular
charges
may
cause
the
defeat
of
the
best
cavalry
in
partial
skirmishes
but
it
has
also
demonstrated
that
they
are
not
to
be
depended
upon
in
regular
battles
upon
which
the
fate
of
a
war
may
depend
such
charges
are
valuable
accessories
to
an
attack
in
line
but
alone
they
can
lead
to
no
decisive
results
from
the
preceding
facts
we
learn
that
it
is
always
best
to
give
cavalry
a
regular
organization
and
furnish
them
long
weapons
not
omitting
however
to
provide
for
skirmishing
an
irregular
cavalry
armed
with
pistols
lances
and
sabers
whatever
system
of
organization
be
adopted
it
is
certain
that
a
numerous
cavalry
whether
regular
or
irregular
must
have
a
great
influence
in
giving
a
turn
to
the
events
of
a
war
it
may
excite
a
feeling
of
apprehension
at
distant
parts
of
the
enemy
country
it
can
carry
off
his
convoys
it
can
encircle
his
army
make
his
communications
very
perilous
and
destroy
the
of
his
operations
in
a
word
it
produces
nearly
the
same
results
as
a
rising
of
a
population
causing
trouble
on
the
front
flanks
and
rear
of
an
army
and
reducing
a
general
to
a
state
of
entire
uncertainty
in
his
calculations
any
system
of
organization
therefore
will
be
a
good
one
which
provides
for
great
enlargement
of
the
cavalry
in
time
of
war
by
the
incorporation
of
militia
for
they
may
with
the
aid
of
a
few
good
regular
squadrons
be
made
excellent
partisan
soldiers
these
militia
would
certainly
not
possess
all
the
qualities
of
those
warlike
wandering
tribes
who
live
on
horseback
and
seem
born
but
they
could
in
a
measure
supply
the
places
of
such
in
this
respect
russia
is
much
better
off
than
any
of
her
neighbors
both
on
account
of
the
number
and
quality
of
her
horsemen
of
the
don
and
the
character
of
the
irregular
militia
she
can
bring
into
the
field
at
very
short
notice
twenty
years
ago
i
made
the
following
statements
in
chapter
xxxv
of
the
treatise
on
grand
military
operations
when
writing
on
this
subject
the
immense
advantages
of
the
cossacks
to
the
russian
army
are
not
to
be
estimated
these
light
troops
which
are
insignificant
in
the
shock
of
a
great
battle
except
for
falling
upon
the
flanks
are
terrible
in
pursuits
and
in
a
war
of
posts
they
are
a
most
formidable
obstacle
to
the
execution
of
a
general
designs
because
he
can
never
be
sure
of
the
arrival
and
carrying
out
of
his
orders
his
convoys
are
always
in
danger
and
his
operations
uncertain
if
an
army
has
had
only
a
few
regiments
of
these
their
real
value
has
not
been
known
but
when
their
number
increases
to
fifteen
thousand
or
twenty
thousand
their
usefulness
is
fully
recognized
especially
in
a
country
where
the
population
is
not
hostile
to
them
when
they
are
in
the
vicinity
every
convoy
must
be
provided
with
a
strong
escort
and
no
movement
can
be
expected
to
be
undisturbed
much
unusual
labor
is
thus
made
necessary
upon
the
part
of
the
regular
cavalry
which
is
soon
broken
down
by
the
unaccustomed
fatigue
volunteer
hussars
or
lancers
raised
at
the
time
of
war
breaking
out
may
be
nearly
as
valuable
as
the
cossacks
if
they
are
well
officered
and
move
freely
about
from
point
to
point
in
the
hungarians
transylvanians
and
croats
austria
has
resources
possessed
by
few
other
states
the
services
rendered
by
mounted
militia
have
proved
however
that
this
kind
of
cavalry
may
be
very
useful
if
for
no
other
purpose
than
relieving
the
regular
cavalry
of
those
occasional
and
extra
duties
to
be
performed
in
all
armies
such
as
forming
escorts
acting
as
orderlies
protecting
convoys
serving
on
outposts
mixed
corps
of
regular
and
irregular
cavalry
may
often
be
more
really
useful
than
if
they
were
entirely
composed
of
cavalry
of
the
line
because
the
fear
of
compromising
a
body
of
these
last
often
restrains
a
general
from
pushing
them
forward
in
daring
operations
where
he
would
not
hesitate
to
risk
his
irregulars
and
he
may
thus
lose
excellent
opportunities
of
accomplishing
great
results

to

my
statement
wagner
cites
the
case
of
the
battle
of
ramillies
where
marlborough
by
a
general
charge
of
cavalry
in
fall
lines
succeeded
in
beating
the
french
drawn
up
checkerwise
unless
my
memory
deceives
me
the
allied
cavalry
was
at
first
formed
checkered
in
two
lines
but
the
real
cause
of
marlborough
success
was
his
seeing
that
villeroi
had
paralyzed
half
his
army
behind
anderkirch
and
gette
and
his
having
the
good
sense
to
withdraw
squadrons
from
this
wing
to
reinforce
his
left
which
in
this
way
had
twice
as
many
cavalry
as
the
french
and
outflanked
them
but
i
cheerfully
admit
that
there
may
be
many
exceptions
to
a
rule
which
i
have
not
laid
down

employment
of
artillery
artillery
is
an
arm
equally
formidable
both
in
the
offensive
and
defensive
as
an
offensive
means
a
great
battery
well
managed
may
break
an
enemy
line
throw
it
into
confusion
and
prepare
the
way
for
the
troops
that
are
to
make
an
assault
as
a
defensive
means
it
doubles
the
strength
of
a
position
not
only
on
account
of
the
material
injury
it
inflicts
upon
the
enemy
while
at
a
distance
and
the
consequent
moral
effect
upon
his
troops
but
also
by
greatly
increasing
the
peril
of
approaching
near
and
specially
within
the
range
of
grape
it
is
no
less
important
in
the
attack
and
defense
of
fortified
places
or
intrenched
camps
for
it
is
one
of
the
main
reliances
in
modern
systems
of
fortification
i
have
already
in
a
former
portion
of
this
book
given
some
directions
as
to
the
distribution
of
artillery
in
a
line
of
battle
but
it
is
difficult
to
explain
definitely
the
proper
method
of
using
it
in
the
battle
itself
it
will
not
be
right
to
say
that
artillery
can
act
independently
of
the
other
arms
for
it
is
rather
an
accessory
at
wagram
however
napoleon
threw
a
battery
of
one
hundred
pieces
into
the
gap
left
by
the
withdrawal
of
massena
corps
and
thus
held
in
check
the
austrian
center
notwithstanding
their
vigorous
efforts
to
advance
this
was
a
special
case
and
should
not
be
often
imitated
i
will
content
myself
with
laying
down
a
few
fundamental
rules
observing
that
they
refer
to
the
present
state
of
artillery
service
the
recent
discoveries
not
yet
being
fully
tested
i
shall
say
little
with
reference
to
them
in
the
offensive
a
certain
portion
of
the
artillery
should
concentrate
its
fire
upon
the
point
where
a
decisive
blow
is
to
be
struck
its
first
use
is
to
shatter
the
enemy
line
and
then
it
assists
with
its
fire
the
attack
of
the
infantry
and
cavalry
several
batteries
of
should
follow
the
offensive
movements
of
the
columns
of
attack
besides
the
intended
for
the
same
purpose
too
much
should
not
move
with
an
offensive
column
it
may
be
posted
so
as
to
with
the
column
without
accompanying
it
when
the
cannoneers
can
mount
the
boxes
it
may
have
greater
mobility
and
be
advanced
farther
to
the
front
it
has
already
been
stated
that
half
of
the
should
be
held
in
reserve
that
it
may
be
rapidly
moved
to
any
required
point
for
this
purpose
it
should
be
placed
upon
the
most
open
ground
whence
it
can
move
readily
in
every
direction
i
have
already
indicated
the
best
positions
for
the
heavy
calibers
the
batteries
whatever
may
be
their
general
distribution
along
the
defensive
line
should
give
their
attention
particularly
to
those
points
where
the
enemy
would
be
most
likely
to
approach
either
on
account
of
the
facility
or
the
advantage
of
so
doing
the
general
of
artillery
should
therefore
know
the
decisive
strategic
and
tactical
points
of
the
as
well
as
the
topography
of
the
whole
space
occupied
the
distribution
of
the
reserves
of
artillery
will
be
regulated
by
these
artillery
placed
on
level
ground
or
ground
sloping
gently
to
the
front
is
most
favorably
situated
either
for
or
ricochet
firing
a
converging
fire
is
the
best
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
chief
office
of
all
artillery
in
battles
is
to
overwhelm
the
enemy
troops
and
not
to
reply
to
their
batteries
it
is
nevertheless
often
useful
to
fire
at
the
batteries
in
order
to
attract
their
fire
a
third
of
the
disposable
artillery
may
be
assigned
this
duty
but
at
least
should
be
directed
against
the
infantry
and
cavalry
of
the
enemy
if
the
enemy
advance
in
deployed
lines
the
batteries
should
endeavor
to
cross
their
fire
in
order
to
strike
the
lines
obliquely
if
guns
can
be
so
placed
as
to
enfilade
a
line
of
troops
a
most
powerful
effect
is
produced
when
the
enemy
advance
in
columns
they
may
be
battered
in
front
it
is
advantageous
also
to
attack
them
obliquely
and
especially
in
flank
and
reverse
the
moral
effect
of
a
reverse
fire
upon
a
body
of
troops
is
inconceivable
and
the
best
soldiers
are
generally
put
to
flight
by
it
the
fine
movement
of
ney
on
preititz
at
bautzen
was
neutralized
by
a
few
pieces
of
kleist
artillery
which
took
his
columns
in
flank
checked
them
and
decided
the
marshal
to
deviate
from
the
excellent
direction
he
was
pursuing
a
few
pieces
of
light
artillery
thrown
at
all
hazards
upon
the
enemy
flank
may
produce
most
important
results
far
overbalancing
the
risks
run
batteries
should
always
have
supports
of
infantry
or
cavalry
and
especially
on
their
flanks
cases
may
occur
where
the
rule
may
be
deviated
from
wagram
is
a
very
remarkable
example
of
this
it
is
very
important
that
artillerists
when
threatened
by
cavalry
preserve
their
coolness
they
should
fire
first
solid
shot
next
shells
and
then
grape
as
long
as
possible
the
infantry
supports
should
in
such
a
case
form
squares
in
the
vicinity
to
shelter
the
horses
and
when
necessary
the
cannoneers
when
the
infantry
is
drawn
up
behind
the
pieces
large
squares
of
sufficient
size
to
contain
whatever
they
should
cover
are
best
but
when
the
infantry
is
on
the
flanks
smaller
squares
are
better
may
also
be
very
efficient
in
frightening
the
horses
when
infantry
threatens
artillery
the
latter
should
continue
its
fire
to
the
last
moment
being
careful
not
to
commence
firing
too
soon
the
cannoneers
can
always
be
sheltered
from
an
infantry
attack
if
the
battery
is
properly
supported
this
is
a
case
for
the
of
the
three
arms
for
if
the
enemy
infantry
is
thrown
into
confusion
by
the
artillery
a
combined
attack
upon
it
by
cavalry
and
infantry
will
cause
its
destruction
the
proportions
of
artillery
have
varied
in
different
wars
napoleon
conquered
italy
in
with
forty
or
fifty
pieces
whilst
in
he
invaded
russia
with
one
thousand
pieces
thoroughly
equipped
and
failed
these
facts
show
that
any
fixed
rule
on
the
subject
is
inadmissible
usually
three
pieces
to
a
thousand
combatants
are
allowed
but
this
allowance
will
depend
on
circumstances
the
relative
proportions
of
heavy
and
light
artillery
vary
also
between
wide
limits
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
have
too
much
heavy
artillery
whose
mobility
must
be
much
less
than
that
of
the
lighter
calibers
a
remarkable
proof
of
the
great
importance
of
having
a
strong
was
given
by
napoleon
after
the
battle
of
eylau
the
great
havoc
occasioned
among
his
troops
by
the
numerous
guns
of
the
russians
opened
his
eyes
to
the
necessity
of
increasing
his
own
with
wonderful
vigor
he
set
all
the
prussian
arsenals
to
work
those
along
the
rhine
and
even
at
metz
to
increase
the
number
of
his
pieces
and
to
cast
new
ones
in
order
to
enable
him
to
use
the
munitions
previously
captured
in
three
months
he
doubled
the
and
of
his
artillery
at
a
distance
of
one
thousand
miles
from
his
own
frontiers
a
feat
without
a
parallel
in
the
annals
of
war
one
of
the
surest
means
of
using
the
artillery
to
the
best
advantage
is
to
place
in
command
of
it
a
general
who
is
at
once
a
good
strategist
and
tactician
this
chief
should
be
authorized
to
dispose
not
only
of
the
reserve
artillery
but
also
of
half
the
pieces
attached
to
the
different
corps
or
divisions
of
the
army
he
should
also
consult
with
the
commanding
general
as
to
the
moment
and
place
of
concentration
of
the
mass
of
his
artillery
in
order
to
contribute
most
to
a
successful
issue
of
the
day
and
he
should
never
take
the
responsibility
of
thus
massing
his
artillery
without
previous
orders
from
the

i

to

of
the

use
of
the

i
am
restrained
from
so
doing
by
considering
the
great
variety
of
points
necessary
to
be
touched
upon
if
i
should
attempt
to
go
into
an
examination
of
all
the
detailed
operations
that
would
arise
in
the
application
of
the
general
rules
laid
down
for
each
of
the
arms
several
authors
chiefly
german
have
treated
this
subject
very
extensively
and
their
labors
are
valuable
principally
because
they
consist
mainly
of
citations
of
numerous
examples
taken
from
the
actual
minor
engagements
of
the
later
wars
these
examples
must
indeed
take
the
place
of
rules
since
experience
has
shown
that
fixed
rules
on
the
subject
can
not
be
laid
down
it
seems
a
waste
of
breath
to
say
that
the
commander
of
a
body
of
troops
composed
of
the
three
arms
should
employ
them
so
that
they
will
give
mutual
support
and
assistance
but
after
all
this
is
the
only
fundamental
rule
that
can
be
established
for
the
attempt
to
prescribe
for
such
a
commander
a
special
course
of
conduct
in
every
case
that
may
arise
when
these
cases
may
be
infinitely
varied

him

the

of
such
details
i
can
only
refer
my
readers
to
the
best
works
which
do
treat
of
them
i
have
said
all
i
can
properly

when
i
advise
that
the

arms
be
posted
in
conformity
with
the
character
of
the

to
the
object

a
careful

on

points
and
the
ability
to
use
at

right
time
and
place
his
knowledge

of
the

either
single
or
combined
conclusion
i
am
constrained
to
recapitulate
the
principal
facts
which
may
be
regarded
as
fundamental
in
war
war
in
its
is
not
a
science
but
an
art
strategy
particularly
may
indeed
be
regulated
by
fixed
laws
resembling
those
of
the
positive
sciences
but
this
is
not
true
of
war
viewed
as
a
whole
among
other
things
combats
may
be
mentioned
as
often
being
quite
independent
of
scientific
combinations
and
they
may
become
essentially
dramatic
personal
qualities
and
inspirations
and
a
thousand
other
things
frequently
being
the
controlling
elements
the
passions
which
agitate
the
masses
that
are
brought
into
collision
the
warlike
qualities
of
these
masses
the
energy
and
talent
of
their
commanders
the
spirit
more
or
less
martial
of
nations
and
epochs
in
a
word
every
thing
that
can
be
called
the
poetry
and
metaphysics
of
war
will
have
a
permanent
influence
on
its
results
shall
i
be
understood
as
saying
that
there
are
no
such
things
as
tactical
rules
and
that
no
theory
of
tactics
can
be
useful
what
military
man
of
intelligence
would
be
guilty
of
such
an
absurdity
are
we
to
imagine
that
eugene
and
marlborough
triumphed
simply
by
inspiration
or
by
the
superior
courage
and
discipline
of
their
battalions
or
do
we
find
in
the
events
of
turin
blenheim
and
ramillies
maneuvers
resembling
those
seen
at
talavera
waterloo
jena
or
austerlitz
which
were
the
causes
of
the
victory
in
each
case
when
the
application
of
a
rule
and
the
consequent
maneuver
have
procured
victory
a
hundred
times
for
skillful
generals
and
always
have
in
their
favor
the
great
probability
of
leading
to
success
shall
their
occasional
failure
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
entirely
denying
their
value
and
for
distrusting
the
effect
of
the
study
of
the
art
shall
a
theory
be
pronounced
absurd
because
it
has
only
of
the
whole
number
of
chances
of
success
in
its
favor
the
of
an
army
and
its
chief
officers
has
an
influence
upon
the
fate
of
a
war
and
this
seems
to
be
due
to
a
certain
physical
effect
produced
by
the
moral
cause
for
example
the
impetuous
attack
upon
a
hostile
line
of
twenty
thousand
brave
men
whose
feelings
are
thoroughly
enlisted
in
their
cause
will
produce
a
much
more
powerful
effect
than
the
attack
of
forty
thousand
demoralized
or
apathetic
men
upon
the
same
point
strategy
as
has
already
been
explained
is
the
art
of
bringing
the
greatest
part
of
the
forces
of
an
army
upon
the
important
point
of
the
theater
of
war
or
of
the
zone
of
operations
tactics
is
the
art
of
using
these
masses
at
the
points
to
which
they
shall
have
been
conducted
by
marches
that
is
to
say
the
art
of
making
them
act
at
the
decisive
moment
and
at
the
decisive
point
of
the
field
of
battle
when
troops
are
thinking
more
of
flight
than
of
fight
they
can
no
longer
be
termed
active
masses
in
the
sense
in
which
i
use
the
term
a
general
thoroughly
instructed
in
the
theory
of
war
but
not
possessed
of
military
coolness
and
skill
may
make
an
excellent
strategic
plan
and
be
entirely
unable
to
apply
the
rules
of
tactics
in
presence
of
an
enemy
his
projects
will
not
be
successfully
carried
out
and
his
defeat
will
be
probable
if
he
be
a
man
of
character
he
will
be
able
to
diminish
the
evil
results
of
his
failure
but
if
he
lose
his
wits
he
will
lose
his
army
the
same
general
may
on
the
other
hand
be
at
once
a
good
tactician
and
strategist
and
have
made
all
the
arrangements
for
gaining
a
victory
that
his
means
will
permit
in
this
case
if
he
be
only
moderately
seconded
by
his
troops
and
subordinate
officers
he
will
probably
gain
a
decided
victory
if
however
his
troops
have
neither
discipline
nor
courage
and
his
subordinate
officers
envy
and
deceive
him
he
will
undoubtedly
see
his
fine
hopes
fade
away
and
his
admirable
combinations
can
only
have
the
effect
of
diminishing
the
disasters
of
an
almost
unavoidable
defeat
no
system
of
tactics
can
lead
to
victory
when
the
of
an
army
is
bad
and
even
when
it
may
be
excellent
the
victory
may
depend
upon
some
occurrence
like
the
rupture
of
the
bridges
over
the
danube
at
essling
neither
will
victories
be
necessarily
gained
or
lost
by
rigid
adherence
to
or
rejection
of
this
or
that
manner
of
forming
troops
for
battle
these
truths
need
not
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
there
can
be
no
sound
rules
in
war
the
observance
of
which
the
chances
being
equal
will
lead
to
success
it
is
true
that
theories
can
not
teach
men
with
mathematical
precision
what
they
should
do
in
every
possible
case
but
it
is
also
certain
that
they
will
always
point
out
the
errors
which
should
be
avoided
and
this
is
a
consideration
for
these
rules
thus
become
in
the
hands
of
skillful
generals
commanding
brave
troops
means
of
almost
certain
success
the
correctness
of
this
statement
can
not
be
denied
and
it
only
remains
to
be
able
to
discriminate
between
good
rules
and
bad
in
this
ability
consists
the
whole
of
a
man
genius
for
war
there
are
however
leading
principles
which
assist
in
obtaining
this
ability
every
maxim
relating
to
war
will
be
good
if
it
indicates
the
employment
of
the
greatest
portion
of
the
means
of
action
at
the
decisive
moment
and
place
in
chapter
iii
i
have
specified
all
the
strategic
combinations
which
lead
to
such
a
result
as
regards
tactics
the
principal
thing
to
be
attended
to
is
the
choice
of
the
most
suitable
order
of
battle
for
the
object
in
view
when
we
come
to
consider
the
action
of
masses
on
the
field
the
means
to
be
used
may
be
an
opportune
charge
of
cavalry
a
strong
battery
put
in
position
and
unmasked
at
the
proper
moment
a
column
of
infantry
making
a
headlong
charge
or
a
deployed
division
coolly
and
steadily
pouring
upon
the
enemy
a
fire
or
they
may
consist
of
tactical
maneuvers
intended
to
threaten
the
enemy
flanks
or
rear
or
any
other
maneuver
calculated
to
diminish
the
confidence
of
the
adversary
each
of
these
things
may
in
a
particular
case
be
the
cause
of
victory
to
define
the
cases
in
which
each
should
be
preferred
is
simply
impossible
if
a
general
desires
to
be
a
successful
actor
in
the
great
drama
of
war
his
first
duty
is
to
study
carefully
the
theater
of
operations
that
he
may
see
clearly
the
relative
advantages
and
disadvantages
it
presents
for
himself
and
his
enemies
this
being
done
he
can
understandingly
proceed
to
prepare
his
base
of
operations
then
to
choose
the
most
suitable
zone
of
operations
for
his
main
efforts
and
in
doing
so
keep
constantly
before
his
mind
the
principles
of
the
art
of
war
relative
to
lines
and
fronts
of
operations
the
offensive
army
should
particularly
endeavor
to
cut
up
the
opposing
army
by
skillfully
selecting
objective
points
of
maneuver
it
will
then
assume
as
the
objects
of
its
subsequent
undertakings
geographical
points
of
more
or
less
importance
depending
upon
its
first
successes
the
defensive
army
on
the
contrary
should
endeavor
by
all
means
to
neutralize
the
first
forward
movement
of
its
adversary
protracting
operations
as
long
as
possible
while
not
compromising
the
fate
of
the
war
and
deferring
a
decisive
battle
until
the
time
when
a
portion
of
the
enemy
forces
are
either
exhausted
by
labors
or
scattered
for
the
purpose
of
occupying
invaded
provinces
masking
fortified
places
covering
sieges
protecting
the
line
of
operations
depots
up
to
this
point
every
thing
relates
to
a
first
plan
of
operations
but
no
plan
can
provide
with
certainty
for
that
which
is
uncertain
always
the
character
and
the
issue
of
the
first
conflict
if
your
lines
of
operations
have
been
skillfully
chosen
and
your
movements
well
concealed
and
if
on
the
other
hand
your
enemy
makes
false
movements
which
permit
you
to
fall
on
fractions
of
his
army
you
maybe
successful
in
your
campaign
without
fighting
general
battles
by
the
simple
use
of
your
strategic
advantages
but
if
the
two
parties
seem
about
equally
matched
at
the
time
of
conflict
there
will
result
one
of
those
stupendous
tragedies
like
borodino
wagram
waterloo
bautzen
and
dresden
where
the
precepts
of
grand
tactics
as
indicated
in
the
chapter
on
that
subject
must
have
a
powerful
influence
if
a
few
prejudiced
military
men
after
reading
this
book
and
carefully
studying
the
detailed
and
correct
history
of
the
campaigns
of
the
great
masters
of
the
art
of
war
still
contend
that
it
has
neither
principles
nor
rules
i
can
only
pity
them
and
reply
in
the
famous
words
of
frederick
that
a
mule
which
had
made
twenty
campaigns
under
prince
eugene
would
not
be
a
better
tactician
than
at
the
beginning
correct
theories
founded
upon
right
principles
sustained
by
actual
events
of
wars
and
added
to
accurate
military
history
will
form
a
true
school
of
instruction
for
generals
if
these
means
do
not
produce
great
men
they
will
at
least
produce
generals
of
sufficient
skill
to
take
rank
next
after
the
natural
masters
of
the
art
of
war

supplement
to
the
summary
of
the
art
of
war
my
summary
of
the
art
of
war
published
in
to
assist
in
the
military
instruction
of
the
hereditary
grand
duke
of
russia
contained
a
concluding
article
that
was
never
printed
i
deem
it
expedient
to
give
it
now
in
the
form
of
a
supplement
and
add
a
special
article
upon
the
means
of
acquiring
a
certain
and
ready
strategic
it
is
essential
for
the
reader
of
my
summary
to
understand
clearly
that
in
the
military
science
as
in
every
other
the
study
of
details
is
easy
for
the
man
who
has
learned
how
to
seize
the
fundamental
features
to
which
all
others
are
secondary
i
am
about
to
attempt
a
development
of
these
elements
of
the
art
and
my
readers
should
endeavor
to
apprehend
them
clearly
and
to
apply
them
properly
i
can
not
too
often
repeat
that
the
theory
of
the
great
combinations
of
war
is
in
itself
very
simple
and
requires
nothing
more
than
ordinary
intelligence
and
careful
consideration
notwithstanding
its
simplicity
many
learned
military
men
have
difficulty
in
grasping
it
thoroughly
their
minds
wander
off
to
accessory
details
in
place
of
fixing
themselves
on
first
causes
and
they
go
a
long
way
in
search
of
what
is
just
within
their
reach
if
they
only
would
think
so
two
very
different
things
must
exist
in
a
man
to
make
him
a
general
must
know
how
to
arrange
a
good
plan
of
operations
and
how
to
carry
it
to
a
successful
the
first
of
these
talents
may
be
a
natural
gift
but
it
may
also
be
acquired
and
developed
by
study
the
second
depends
more
on
individual
character
is
rather
a
personal
attribute
and
can
not
be
created
by
study
although
it
may
be
improved
it
is
particularly
necessary
for
a
monarch
or
the
head
of
a
government
to
possess
the
first
of
these
talents
because
in
such
case
although
he
may
not
have
the
ability
to
execute
he
can
arrange
plans
of
operations
and
decide
correctly
as
to
the
excellence
or
defects
of
those
submitted
to
him
by
others
he
is
thus
enabled
to
estimate
properly
the
capacity
of
his
generals
and
when
he
finds
a
general
producing
a
good
plan
and
having
firmness
and
coolness
such
a
man
may
be
safely
trusted
with
the
command
of
an
army
if
on
the
other
hand
the
head
of
a
state
is
a
man
of
executive
ability
but
not
possessing
the
faculty
of
arranging
wise
military
combinations
he
will
be
likely
to
commit
all
the
faults
that
have
characterized
the
campaigns
of
many
celebrated
warriors
who
were
only
brave
soldiers
without
being
at
all
improved
by
study
from
the
principles
which
i
have
laid
down
and
their
application
to
several
famous
campaigns
my
readers
will
perceive
that
the
theory
of
the
great
combinations
of
war
may
be
summed
up
in
the
following
truths
the
science
of
strategy
consists
in
the
first
place
in
knowing
how
to
choose
well
a
theater
of
war
and
to
estimate
correctly
that
of
the
enemy
to
do
this
a
general
must
accustom
himself
to
decide
as
to
the
importance
of
decisive
points
which
is
not
a
difficult
matter
when
he
is
aided
by
the
hints
i
have
given
on
the
subject
particularly
in
articles
from
xviii
to
xxii
the
art
consists
next
in
a
proper
employment
of
the
troops
upon
the
theater
of
operations
whether
offensive
or
defensive
see
article
xvii
this
employment
of
the
forces
should
be
regulated
by
two
fundamental
principles
the
first
being
obtain
by
free
and
rapid
movements
the
advantage
of
bringing
the
mass
of
the
troops
against
fractions
of
the
enemy
the
second
to
strike
in
the
most
decisive
that
is
to
say
in
that
direction
where
the
consequences
of
his
defeat
may
be
most
disastrous
to
the
enemy
while
at
the
same
time
his
success
would
yield
him
no
great
advantages
the
whole
science
of
great
military
combination
is
comprised
in
these
two
fundamental
truths
therefore
all
movements
that
are
disconnected
or
more
extended
than
those
of
the
enemy
would
be
grave
faults
so
also
would
the
occupation
of
a
position
that
was
too
much
cut
up
or
sending
out
a
large
detachment
unnecessarily
on
the
contrary
every
compact
system
of
operations
would
be
wise
so
also
with
central
strategic
lines
and
every
strategic
position
less
extended
than
the
enemy
the
application
of
these
fundamental
principles
is
also
very
simple
if
you
have
one
hundred
battalions
against
an
equal
number
of
the
enemy
you
may
by
their
mobility
and
by
taking
the
initiative
bring
eighty
of
them
to
the
decisive
point
while
employing
the
remaining
twenty
to
observe
and
deceive
half
of
the
opposing
army
you
will
thus
have
eighty
battalions
against
fifty
at
the
point
where
the
important
contest
is
to
take
place
you
will
reach
this
point
by
rapid
marches
by
interior
lines
or
by
a
general
movement
toward
one
extremity
of
the
hostile
line
i
have
indicated
the
cases
in
which
one
or
the
other
of
these
means
is
to
be
preferred
see
pages
and
following
in
arranging
a
plan
of
operations
it
is
important
to
remember
that
a
strategic
theater
as
well
as
every
position
occupied
by
an
army
has
a
center
and
two
extremities
a
theater
has
usually
three
zones
a
right
a
left
and
a
central
in
choosing
a
zone
of
operations
select
one
that
will
furnish
a
safe
and
advantageous
base
in
which
the
least
risk
will
be
run
by
yourself
while
the
enemy
will
be
most
exposed
to
injury
bearing
in
mind
the
antecedent
situations
of
the
two
parties
and
the
dispositions
and
inclinations
of
the
powers
whose
territories
are
near
the
theater
of
war
one
of
the
zones
will
always
be
decidedly
bad
or
dangerous
while
the
other
two
will
be
more
or
less
suitable
according
to
circumstances
the
zone
and
base
being
fixed
upon
the
object
of
the
first
attempts
must
be
selected
this
is
choosing
an
objective
of
operations
there
are
two
very
different
kinds
some
that
are
called
or
geographical
refer
simply
to
an
enemy
line
of
defense
which
it
is
desired
to
get
possession
of
or
a
fortress
or
intrenched
camp
to
be
captured
others
on
the
contrary
consist
entirely
in
the
destruction
or
disorganization
of
the
enemy
forces
without
giving
attention
to
geographical
points
of
any
this
was
the
favorite
objective
of
napoleon
i
can
profitably
add
nothing
to
what
i
have
already
written
on
this
point
page
as
the
choice
of
the
objective
is
by
far
the
most
important
thing
in
a
plan
of
i
recommend
the
whole
of
article
pages
and
following
the
objective
being
determined
upon
the
army
will
move
toward
it
by
one
or
two
lines
of
operations
care
being
taken
to
conform
to
the
fundamental
principle
laid
down
and
to
avoid
double
lines
unless
the
character
of
the
theater
of
war
makes
it
necessary
to
use
them
or
the
enemy
is
very
inferior
either
in
the
number
or
the
quality
of
his
troops
article
xxi
treats
this
subject
fully
if
two
geographical
lines
are
used
it
is
essential
to
move
the
great
mass
of
the
forces
along
the
most
important
of
them
and
to
occupy
the
secondary
line
by
detachments
having
a
concentric
direction
if
possible
with
the
main
body
the
army
being
on
its
way
toward
the
objective
before
arriving
in
presence
of
the
enemy
and
giving
battle
occupies
daily
or
temporary
strategic
positions
the
front
it
embraces
or
that
upon
which
the
enemy
may
attack
is
its
front
of
operations
there
is
an
important
consideration
with
reference
to
the
direction
of
the
front
of
operations
and
to
changes
it
may
receive
which
i
have
dwelt
upon
in
article
page
the
fundamental
principle
requires
even
when
the
forces
are
equal
that
the
front
be
less
extensive
than
the
enemy
especially
if
the
front
remains
unchanged
for
some
time
if
your
strategic
positions
are
more
closely
connected
than
the
enemy
you
can
concentrate
more
rapidly
and
more
easily
than
he
can
and
in
this
way
the
fundamental
principle
will
be
applied
if
your
positions
are
interior
and
central
the
enemy
can
not
concentrate
except
by
passing
by
the
mass
of
your
divisions
or
by
moving
in
a
circle
around
them
he
is
then
exactly
in
a
condition
not
to
be
able
to
apply
the
fundamental
principle
while
it
is
your
most
obvious
measure
but
if
you
are
very
weak
and
the
enemy
very
strong
a
central
position
that
may
be
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
forces
superior
at
every
point
is
untenable
unless
the
enemy
corps
are
very
far
separated
from
each
other
as
was
the
case
with
the
allied
armies
in
the
seven
years
war
or
unless
the
central
zone
has
a
natural
barrier
on
one
or
two
of
its
sides
like
the
rhine
the
danube
or
the
alps
which
would
prevent
the
enemy
from
using
his
forces
simultaneously
in
case
of
great
numerical
inferiority
it
is
nevertheless
wiser
to
maneuver
upon
one
of
the
extremities
than
upon
the
center
of
the
enemy
line
especially
if
his
masses
are
sufficiently
near
to
be
dangerous
to
you
it
was
stated
above
that
strategy
besides
indicating
the
decisive
points
of
a
theater
of
war
requires
two
things
that
the
principal
mass
of
the
force
be
moved
against
fractions
of
the
enemy
to
attack
them
in
succession
that
the
best
direction
of
movement
be
adopted
that
is
to
say
one
leading
straight
to
the
decisive
points
already
known
and
afterward
upon
secondary
points
to
illustrate
these
immutable
principles
of
strategy
i
will
give
a
sketch
of
the
operations
of
the
french
at
the
close
of
see
plate
iii
it
will
be
recollected
that
the
allies
had
ten
principal
corps
on
the
frontier
of
france
from
the
rhine
to
the
north
sea
the
duke
of
york
was
attacking
dunkirk
no
marshal
freytag
was
covering
the
siege
no
the
prince
of
orange
was
occupying
an
intermediate
position
at
menin
no
the
prince
of
coburg
with
the
main
army
was
attacking
maubeuge
and
was
guarding
the
space
between
that
place
and
the
scheldt
by
strong
detachments
no
clairfayt
was
covering
the
siege
no
benjouski
was
covering
charleroi
and
the
meuse
toward
thuin
and
charleroi
the
fortifications
of
which
were
being
rebuilt
no
another
corps
was
covering
the
ardennes
and
luxembourg
no
the
prussians
were
besieging
landau
no
the
duke
of
brunswick
was
covering
the
siege
in
the
vosges
no
general
wurmser
was
observing
strasbourg
and
the
army
of
the
rhine
no
the
french
besides
the
detachments
in
front
of
each
of
the
hostile
corps
had
five
principal
masses
in
the
camps
of
lille
douai
guise
sarre
louis
and
strasbourg
a
b
c
d
a
strong
reserve
g
composed
of
the
best
troops
drawn
from
the
camps
of
the
northern
frontier
was
intended
to
be
thrown
upon
all
the
points
of
the
line
in
succession
assisted
by
the
troops
already
in
the
neighborhood
i
k
l
this
reserve
assisted
by
the
divisions
of
the
camp
of
cassel
near
dunkirk
commenced
its
operations
by
beating
corps
and
under
the
duke
of
york
then
that
of
the
dutch
no
at
menin
next
that
of
clairfayt
before
maubeuge
finally
joining
the
army
of
the
moselle
toward
sarre
louis
it
beat
the
duke
of
brunswick
in
the
vosges
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
army
of
the
rhine
f
drove
wurmser
from
the
lines
of
wissembourg
the
general
principle
was
certainly
well
applied
and
every
similar
operation
will
be
praiseworthy
but
as
the
austrians
composed
half
the
allied
forces
and
they
had
their
lines
of
retreat
from
the
points
and
upon
the
rhine
it
is
evident
that
if
the
french
had
collected
three
of
their
large
corps
in
order
to
move
them
against
benjouski
at
thuin
no
and
then
fallen
upon
the
prince
of
coburg
left
by
the
charleroi
road
they
would
have
thrown
the
imperial
army
upon
the
north
sea
and
would
have
obtained
immense
results
the
committee
of
public
safety
deemed
it
a
matter
of
great
importance
that
dunkirk
should
not
be
permitted
to
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
english
besides
this
york
corps
encamped
on
the
downs
might
be
cut
off
and
thrown
upon
the
sea
and
the
disposable
french
masses
for
this
object
were
at
douai
lille
and
cassel
so
that
there
were
good
reasons
for
commencing
operations
by
attacking
the
english
the
principal
undertaking
failed
because
houchard
did
not
appreciate
the
strategic
advantage
he
had
and
did
not
know
how
to
act
on
the
line
of
retreat
of
the
army
he
was
guillotined
by
way
of
punishment
although
he
saved
dunkirk
yet
he
failed
to
cut
off
the
english
as
he
might
have
done
it
will
be
observed
that
this
movement
of
the
french
reserve
along
the
whole
front
was
the
cause
of
five
victories
neither
of
which
had
decisive
results
the
attacks
were
made
in
and
because
when
the
cities
were
relieved
the
allied
armies
not
being
cut
through
and
the
french
reserve
moving
on
to
the
different
points
in
succession
none
of
the
victories
was
pushed
to
its
legitimate
consequences
if
the
french
had
based
themselves
upon
the
five
fortified
towns
on
the
meuse
had
collected
one
hundred
thousand
men
by
bold
and
rapid
marches
had
fallen
upon
the
center
of
those
separated
corps
had
crushed
benjouski
assailed
the
prince
of
coburg
in
his
rear
beaten
him
and
pursued
him
vigorously
as
napoleon
pursued
at
ratisbon
and
as
he
wished
to
do
at
ligny
in
the
result
would
have
been
very
different
i
have
mentioned
this
example
as
it
illustrates
very
well
the
two
important
points
to
be
attended
to
in
the
strategic
management
of
masses
of
troops
that
is
their
employment
at
different
points
in
succession
and
at
decisive
points
every
educated
military
man
will
be
impressed
by
the
truths
educed
and
will
be
convinced
that
the
excellence
of
maneuvers
will
depend
upon
their
conforming
to
the
principle
already
insisted
upon
that
is
to
say
the
great
part
of
the
force
must
be
moved
against
one
wing
or
the
center
according
to
the
position
of
the
enemy
masses
it
is
of
importance
in
battles
to
calculate
distances
with
still
greater
accuracy
for
the
results
of
movements
on
the
following
them
more
rapidly
than
in
the
case
of
strategic
maneuvers
every
precaution
must
be
taken
to
avoid
exposing
any
part
of
the
line
to
a
dangerous
attack
from
the
enemy
especially
if
he
is
compactly
drawn
up
add
to
these
things
calmness
during
the
action
the
ability
to
choose
positions
for
fighting
battles
in
the
manner
styled
the
defensive
with
art
xxx
the
simultaneous
employment
of
the
forces
in
striking
the
decisive
blow
see
pages
from
to
the
faculty
of
arousing
the
soldiers
and
moving
them
forward
at
opportune
moments
and
we
have
mentioned
every
thing
which
can
assist
as
far
as
the
general
is
concerned
in
assuring
victories
and
every
thing
which
will
constitute
him
a
skillful
tactician
it
is
almost
always
easy
to
determine
the
decisive
point
of
a
field
of
battle
but
not
so
with
the
decisive
moment
and
it
is
precisely
here
that
genius
and
experience
are
every
thing
and
mere
theory
of
little
value
it
is
important
also
to
consider
attentively
article
which
explains
how
a
general
may
make
a
small
number
of
suppositions
as
to
what
the
enemy
may
or
can
do
and
as
to
what
course
of
conduct
he
shall
himself
pursue
upon
those
hypotheses
he
may
thus
accustom
himself
to
be
prepared
for
any
eventuality
i
must
also
call
attention
to
article
upon
great
detachments
these
are
necessary
evils
and
if
not
managed
with
great
care
may
prove
ruinous
to
the
best
armies
the
essential
rules
on
this
point
are
to
make
as
few
detachments
as
possible
have
them
readily
to
draw
them
back
to
the
main
body
as
soon
as
practicable
and
to
give
them
good
instructions
for
avoiding
disasters
i
have
nothing
to
say
relative
to
the
first
two
chapters
on
military
policy
for
they
are
themselves
nothing
more
than
a
brief
summary
of
this
part
of
the
art
of
war
which
chiefly
concerns
statesmen
but
should
be
thoroughly
understood
by
military
men
i
will
however
invite
special
attention
to
article
relating
to
the
command
of
armies
or
to
the
choice
of
a
subject
worthy
the
most
anxious
care
upon
the
part
of
a
wise
government
for
upon
it
often
depends
the
safety
of
the
nation
we
may
be
confident
that
a
good
strategist
will
make
a
good
chief
of
staff
for
an
army
but
for
the
command
in
chief
is
required
a
man
of
tried
qualities
of
high
character
and
known
energy
the
united
action
of
two
such
men
as
and
chief
of
staff
when
a
great
captain
of
the
first
order
can
not
be
had
may
produce
the
most
brilliant
results
footnotes
footnote
the
objective
may
be
in
some
degree
especially
in
cases
of
wars
of
intervention
in
the
affairs
of
another
country
but
it
then
really
becomes
geographical
footnote
the
operations
mentioned
show
the
advantage
of
employing
masses
at
the
decisive
point
not
because
it
was
done
in
but
because
it
was
not
done
if
napoleon
had
been
in
carnot
place
he
would
have
fallen
with
all
his
force
upon
charleroi
whence
be
would
have
attacked
the
left
of
the
prince
of
coburg
and
cut
his
line
of
retreat
let
any
one
compare
the
results
of
carnot
operations
with
the
wise
maneuvers
of
and
jena
and
be
convinced
note
upon
the
means
of
acquiring
a
good
strategic
the
study
of
the
principles
of
strategy
can
produce
no
valuable
practical
results
if
we
do
nothing
more
than
keep
them
in
remembrance
never
trying
to
apply
them
with
map
in
hand
to
hypothetical
wars
or
to
the
brilliant
operations
of
great
captains
by
such
exercises
may
be
procured
a
rapid
and
certain
strategic
the
most
valuable
characteristic
of
a
good
general
without
which
he
can
never
put
in
practice
the
finest
theories
in
the
world
when
a
military
man
who
is
a
student
of
his
art
has
become
fully
impressed
by
the
advantages
procured
by
moving
a
strong
mass
against
successive
fractions
of
the
enemy
force
and
particularly
when
he
recognizes
the
importance
of
constantly
directing
the
main
efforts
upon
decisive
points
of
the
theater
of
operations
he
will
naturally
desire
to
be
able
to
perceive
at
a
glance
what
are
these
decisive
points
i
have
already
in
chapter
page
of
the
preceding
summary
indicated
the
simple
means
by
which
this
knowledge
may
be
obtained
there
is
in
fact
one
truth
of
remarkable
simplicity
which
obtains
in
all
the
combinations
of
a
methodical
war
it
is
this
every
position
a
general
may
occupy
he
has
only
to
decide
whether
to
operate
by
the
right
by
the
left
or
by
the
to
be
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
this
assertion
let
us
first
take
this
general
in
his
private
office
at
the
opening
of
the
war
his
first
care
will
be
to
choose
that
zone
of
operations
which
will
give
him
the
greatest
number
of
chances
of
success
and
be
the
least
dangerous
for
him
in
case
of
reverse
as
no
theater
of
operations
can
have
more
than
three
zones
that
of
the
right
that
of
the
center
and
that
of
the
left
and
as
i
have
in
articles
from
xvii
to
xxii
pointed
out
the
manner
of
perceiving
the
advantages
and
dangers
of
these
zones
the
choice
of
a
zone
of
operations
will
be
a
matter
of
no
difficulty
when
the
general
has
finally
chosen
a
zone
within
which
to
operate
with
the
principal
portion
of
his
forces
and
when
these
forces
shall
be
established
in
that
zone
the
army
will
have
a
front
of
operations
toward
the
hostile
army
which
will
also
have
one
now
these
fronts
of
operations
will
each
have
its
right
left
and
center
it
only
remains
then
for
the
general
to
decide
upon
which
of
these
directions
he
can
injure
the
enemy
most
for
this
will
always
be
the
best
especially
if
he
can
move
upon
it
without
endangering
his
own
communications
i
have
dwelt
upon
this
point
also
in
the
preceding
summary
finally
when
the
two
armies
are
in
presence
of
each
other
upon
the
field
of
battle
where
the
decisive
collision
is
to
ensue
and
are
upon
the
point
of
coming
to
blows
they
will
each
have
a
right
left
and
center
and
it
remains
for
the
general
to
decide
still
between
these
three
directions
of
striking
let
us
take
as
an
illustration
of
the
truths
i
have
mentioned
the
theater
of
operations
already
referred
to
between
the
rhine
and
the
north
sea
see
fig
although
this
theater
presents
in
one
point
of
view
four
geographical
sections
viz
the
space
between
the
rhine
and
the
moselle
that
between
the
moselle
and
the
meuse
that
between
the
meuse
and
the
scheldt
and
that
between
the
last
river
and
the
sea
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
an
army
of
which
a
a
is
the
base
and
b
b
the
front
of
operations
will
have
only
three
general
directions
to
choose
from
for
the
two
spaces
in
the
center
will
form
a
single
central
zone
as
it
will
always
have
one
on
the
right
and
another
on
the
left
illustration
fig
the
army
b
b
wishing
to
take
the
offensive
against
the
army
cc
whose
base
was
the
rhine
would
have
three
directions
in
which
to
operate
if
it
maneuvered
by
the
extreme
right
descending
the
moselle
toward
d
it
would
evidently
threaten
the
enemy
line
of
retreat
toward
the
rhine
but
he
concentrating
the
mass
of
his
forces
toward
luxembourg
might
fall
upon
the
left
of
the
army
d
and
compel
it
to
change
front
and
fight
a
battle
with
its
rear
toward
the
rhine
causing
its
ruin
if
seriously
defeated
if
on
the
contrary
the
army
b
wished
to
make
its
greatest
effort
upon
the
left
toward
e
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
towns
of
lille
and
valenciennes
it
would
be
exposed
to
inconveniences
still
more
serious
than
before
for
the
army
cc
concentrating
in
force
toward
audenarde
might
fall
on
the
right
of
b
and
outflanking
this
wing
in
the
battle
might
throw
it
upon
the
impassable
country
toward
antwerp
between
the
scheldt
and
the
sea
where
there
would
remain
but
two
things
for
it
to
do
either
to
surrender
at
discretion
or
cut
its
way
through
the
enemy
at
the
sacrifice
of
half
its
numbers
it
appears
evident
therefore
that
the
left
zone
would
be
the
most
disadvantageous
for
army
b
and
the
right
zone
would
be
inconvenient
although
somewhat
favorable
in
a
certain
point
of
view
the
central
zone
remains
to
be
examined
this
is
found
to
possess
all
desirable
advantages
because
the
army
b
might
move
the
mass
of
its
force
toward
charleroi
with
a
view
of
cutting
through
the
immense
front
of
operations
of
the
enemy
might
overwhelm
his
center
and
drive
the
right
back
upon
antwerp
and
the
lower
scheldt
without
seriously
exposing
its
own
communications
when
the
forces
are
chiefly
concentrated
upon
the
most
favorable
zone
they
should
of
course
have
that
direction
of
movement
toward
the
enemy
front
of
operations
which
is
in
harmony
with
the
chief
object
in
view
for
example
if
you
shall
have
operated
by
your
right
against
the
enemy
left
with
the
intention
of
cutting
off
the
greater
portion
of
his
army
from
its
base
of
the
rhine
you
should
certainly
continue
to
operate
in
the
same
direction
for
if
you
should
make
your
greatest
effort
against
the
right
of
the
enemy
front
while
your
plan
was
to
gain
an
advantage
over
his
left
your
operations
could
not
result
as
you
anticipated
no
matter
how
well
they
might
be
executed
if
on
the
contrary
you
had
decided
to
take
the
left
zone
with
the
intention
of
crowding
the
enemy
back
upon
the
sea
you
ought
constantly
to
maneuver
by
your
right
in
order
to
accomplish
your
object
for
if
you
maneuvered
by
the
left
yourself
and
not
the
enemy
would
be
the
party
thrown
back
upon
the
sea
in
case
of
a
reverse
applying
these
ideas
to
the
theaters
of
the
campaigns
of
marengo
ulm
and
jena
we
find
the
same
three
zones
with
this
difference
that
in
those
campaigns
the
central
direction
was
not
the
best
in
the
direction
of
the
left
led
straight
to
the
left
bank
of
the
po
on
the
line
of
retreat
of
mélas
in
the
left
zone
was
the
one
which
led
by
the
way
of
donauwerth
to
the
extreme
right
and
the
line
of
retreat
of
mack
in
however
napoleon
could
reach
the
prussian
line
of
retreat
by
the
right
zone
filing
off
from
bamberg
toward
gera
in
napoleon
had
to
choose
between
a
line
of
operations
on
the
right
leading
to
the
toward
nice
and
savona
that
of
the
center
leading
by
toward
turin
and
that
of
the
left
leading
to
the
line
of
communications
of
mélas
by
way
of
or
the
simplon
the
first
two
directions
had
nothing
in
their
favor
and
the
right
might
have
been
very
dangerous
as
in
fact
it
proved
to
massena
who
was
forced
back
to
genoa
and
there
besieged
the
decisive
direction
was
evidently
that
by
the
left
i
have
said
enough
to
explain
my
ideas
on
this
point
the
subject
of
battles
is
somewhat
more
complicated
for
in
the
arrangements
for
these
there
are
both
strategical
and
tactical
considerations
to
be
taken
into
account
and
harmonized
a
position
for
battle
being
necessarily
connected
with
the
line
of
retreat
and
the
base
of
operations
must
have
a
strategic
direction
but
this
direction
must
also
depend
somewhat
upon
the
character
of
the
ground
and
the
stations
of
the
troops
of
both
parties
to
the
engagement
these
are
tactical
considerations
although
an
army
usually
takes
such
a
position
for
a
battle
as
will
keep
its
line
of
retreat
behind
it
sometimes
it
is
obliged
to
assume
a
position
parallel
to
this
line
in
such
a
case
it
is
evident
that
if
you
fall
with
overwhelming
force
upon
the
wing
nearest
the
line
of
retreat
the
enemy
may
be
cut
off
or
destroyed
or
at
least
have
no
other
chance
of
escape
than
in
forcing
his
way
through
your
line
i
will
here
mention
as
illustrations
the
celebrated
battle
of
leuthen
in
of
which
i
have
given
an
account
in
the
history
of
wars
and
the
famous
days
of
krasnoi
in
the
retreat
from
moscow
in
illustration
fig
the
annexed
figure
explains
the
combination
at
krasnoi
the
line
a
a
is
napoleon
line
of
retreat
toward
he
took
the
position
b
b
to
cover
his
line
it
is
evident
that
the
principal
mass
of
army
d
d
should
have
moved
to
e
e
in
order
to
fall
on
the
right
of
the
french
whose
army
would
have
been
certainly
destroyed
if
it
had
been
anticipated
at
c
for
everybody
knows
in
what
a
state
it
was
while
thus
fifteen
hundred
miles
from
its
true
base
there
was
the
same
combination
at
jemmapes
where
dumouriez
by
outflanking
the
austrian
left
instead
of
attacking
their
right
would
have
entirely
cut
them
off
from
the
rhine
at
the
battle
of
leuthen
frederick
overwhelmed
the
austrian
left
which
was
in
the
direction
of
their
line
of
retreat
and
for
this
reason
the
right
wing
was
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
breslau
where
it
capitulated
a
few
days
later
in
such
cases
there
is
no
cause
for
hesitation
the
decisive
point
is
that
wing
of
the
enemy
which
is
nearest
his
line
of
retreat
and
this
line
you
must
seize
while
protecting
your
own
when
an
enemy
has
one
or
two
lines
of
retreat
perpendicular
to
and
behind
his
position
of
battle
it
will
generally
be
best
to
attack
the
center
or
that
wing
where
the
obstacles
of
the
ground
shall
be
the
least
favorable
for
the
defense
for
in
such
a
case
the
first
consideration
is
to
gain
the
battle
without
having
in
view
the
total
destruction
of
the
enemy
that
depends
upon
the
relative
numerical
strength
the
of
the
two
armies
and
other
circumstances
with
reference
to
which
no
fixed
rules
can
be
laid
down
finally
it
happens
sometimes
that
an
army
succeeds
in
seizing
the
enemy
line
of
retreat
before
fighting
a
battle
as
napoleon
did
at
marengo
ulm
and
jena
the
decisive
point
having
in
such
case
been
secured
by
skillful
marches
before
fighting
it
only
remains
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
forcing
his
way
through
your
line
you
can
do
nothing
better
than
fight
a
parallel
battle
as
there
is
no
reason
for
maneuvering
against
one
wing
more
than
the
other
but
for
the
enemy
who
is
thus
cut
off
the
case
is
very
different
he
should
certainly
strike
most
heavily
in
the
direction
of
that
wing
where
he
can
hope
most
speedily
to
regain
his
proper
line
of
retreat
and
if
he
throws
the
mass
of
his
forces
there
he
may
save
at
least
a
large
portion
of
them
all
that
he
has
to
do
is
to
determine
whether
this
decisive
effort
shall
be
toward
the
right
or
the
left
it
is
proper
for
me
to
remark
that
the
passage
of
a
great
river
in
the
presence
of
a
hostile
army
is
sometimes
an
exceptional
case
to
which
the
general
rules
will
not
apply
in
these
operations
which
are
of
an
exceedingly
delicate
character
the
essential
thing
is
to
keep
the
bridges
safe
if
after
effecting
the
passage
a
general
should
throw
the
mass
of
his
forces
toward
the
right
or
the
left
with
a
view
of
taking
possession
of
some
decisive
point
or
of
driving
his
enemy
back
upon
the
river
whilst
the
latter
was
collecting
all
his
forces
in
another
direction
to
seize
the
bridges
the
former
army
might
be
in
a
very
critical
condition
in
case
of
a
reverse
befalling
it
the
battle
of
wagram
is
an
excellent
example
in
point
as
good
indeed
as
could
be
desired
i
have
treated
this
subject
in
article
pages
and
following
a
military
man
who
clearly
perceives
the
importance
of
the
truths
that
have
been
stated
will
succeed
in
acquiring
a
rapid
and
accurate
it
will
be
admitted
moreover
that
a
general
who
estimates
them
at
their
true
value
and
accustoms
himself
to
their
use
either
in
reading
military
history
or
in
hypothetical
cases
on
maps
will
seldom
be
in
doubt
in
real
campaigns
what
he
ought
to
do
and
even
when
his
enemy
attempts
sudden
and
unexpected
movements
he
will
always
be
ready
with
suitable
measures
for
counteracting
them
by
constantly
bearing
in
mind
the
few
simple
fundamental
principles
which
should
regulate
all
the
operations
of
war
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
pretend
to
lessen
the
dignity
of
the
sublime
art
of
war
by
reducing
it
to
such
simple
elements
i
appreciate
thoroughly
the
difference
between
the
directing
principles
of
combinations
arranged
in
the
quiet
of
the
closet
and
that
special
talent
which
is
indispensable
to
the
individual
who
has
amidst
the
noise
and
confusion
of
battle
to
keep
a
hundred
thousand
men
toward
the
attainment
of
one
single
object
i
know
well
what
should
be
the
character
and
talents
of
the
general
who
has
to
make
such
masses
move
as
one
man
to
engage
them
at
the
proper
point
simultaneously
and
at
the
proper
moment
to
keep
them
supplied
with
arms
provisions
clothing
and
munitions
still
although
this
special
talent
to
which
i
have
referred
is
indispensable
it
must
be
granted
that
the
ability
to
give
wise
direction
to
masses
upon
the
best
strategic
points
of
a
theater
of
operations
is
the
most
sublime
characteristic
of
a
great
captain
how
many
brave
armies
under
the
command
of
leaders
who
were
also
brave
and
possessed
executive
ability
have
lost
not
only
battles
but
even
empires
because
they
were
moved
imprudently
in
one
direction
when
they
should
have
gone
in
the
other
numerous
examples
might
be
mentioned
but
i
will
refer
only
to
ligny
waterloo
bautzen
dennewitz
leuthen
i
will
say
no
more
for
i
could
only
repeat
what
has
already
been
said
to
relieve
myself
in
advance
of
the
blame
which
will
be
ascribed
to
me
for
attaching
too
much
importance
to
the
application
of
the
few
maxims
laid
down
in
my
writings
i
will
repeat
what
i
was
the
first
to
announce
war
is
not
an
exact
science
but
a
drama
full
of
that
the
moral
qualities
the
talents
the
executive
foresight
and
ability
the
greatness
of
character
of
the
leaders
and
the
impulses
sympathies
and
passions
of
the
masses
have
a
great
influence
upon
it
i
may
be
permitted
also
after
having
written
the
detailed
history
of
thirty
campaigns
and
assisted
in
person
in
twelve
of
the
most
celebrated
of
them
to
declare
that
i
have
not
found
a
single
case
where
these
principles
correctly
applied
did
not
lead
to
success
as
to
the
special
executive
ability
and
the
penetrating
mind
which
distinguish
the
practical
man
from
the
one
who
knows
only
what
others
teach
him
i
confess
that
no
book
can
introduce
those
things
into
a
head
where
the
germ
does
not
previously
exist
by
nature
i
have
seen
many
generals
marshals
even
attain
a
certain
degree
of
reputation
by
talking
largely
of
principles
which
they
conceived
incorrectly
in
theory
and
could
not
apply
at
all
i
have
seen
these
men
intrusted
with
the
supreme
command
of
armies
and
make
the
most
extravagant
plans
because
they
were
totally
deficient
in
good
judgment
and
were
filled
with
inordinate
my
works
are
not
intended
for
such
misguided
persons
as
these
but
my
desire
has
been
to
facilitate
the
study
of
the
art
of
war
for
careful
inquiring
minds
by
pointing
out
directing
principles
taking
this
view
i
claim
credit
for
having
rendered
valuable
service
to
those
officers
who
are
really
desirous
of
gaining
distinction
in
the
profession
of
arms
finally
i
will
conclude
this
short
summary
with
one
last
truth
the
first
of
all
the
requisites
for
a
man
success
as
a
leader
is
that
he
be
perfectly
brave
when
a
general
is
animated
by
a
truly
martial
spirit
and
can
communicate
it
to
his
soldiers
he
may
commit
faults
but
he
will
gain
victories
and
secure
deserved
laurels

appendix

of
the
art
of
war
on
the
formation
of
troops
for
battle
happening
to
be
in
paris
near
the
end
of
a
distinguished
person
did
me
the
honor
to
ask
my
opinion
as
to
whether
recent
improvements
in
would
cause
any
great
modifications
in
the
manner
of
making
war
i
replied
that
they
would
probably
have
an
influence
upon
the
details
of
tactics
but
that
in
great
strategic
operations
and
the
grand
combinations
of
battles
victory
would
now
as
ever
result
from
the
application
of
the
principles
which
had
led
to
the
success
of
great
generals
in
all
ages
of
alexander
and
cæsar
as
well
as
of
frederick
and
napoleon
my
illustrious
interlocutor
seemed
to
be
completely
of
my
opinion
the
heroic
events
which
have
recently
occurred
near
sebastopol
have
not
produced
the
slightest
change
in
my
opinion
this
gigantic
contest
between
two
vast
intrenched
camps
occupied
by
entire
armies
and
mounting
two
thousand
guns
of
the
largest
caliber
is
an
event
without
precedent
which
will
have
no
equal
in
the
future
for
the
circumstances
which
produced
it
can
not
occur
again
moreover
this
contest
of
cannon
with
ramparts
bearing
no
resemblance
to
regular
pitched
battles
fought
in
the
center
of
a
continent
can
not
influence
in
any
respect
the
great
combinations
of
war
nor
even
the
tactics
of
battles
the
bloody
battles
of
the
alma
and
inkermann
by
giving
evidence
of
the
murderous
effect
of
the
new
naturally
led
me
to
investigate
the
changes
which
it
might
be
necessary
to
make
on
this
account
in
the
tactics
for
infantry
i
shall
endeavor
to
fulfill
this
task
in
a
few
words
in
order
to
complete
what
was
published
on
this
point
twenty
years
ago
in
the
summary
of
the
art
of
war
the
important
question
of
the
influence
of
in
battles
is
not
new
it
dates
from
the
reign
of
frederick
the
great
and
particularly
from
the
battle
of
mollwitz
which
he
gained
it
was
said
because
his
by
the
use
of
cylindrical
rammers
in
loading
their
muskets
were
able
to
fire
three
shots
per
minute
more
than
their
enemies
the
discussion
which
arose
at
this
epoch
between
the
partisans
of
the
shallow
and
deep
orders
of
formation
for
troops
is
known
to
all
military
students
the
system
of
deployed
lines
in
three
ranks
was
adopted
for
the
infantry
the
cavalry
formed
in
two
ranks
and
in
the
order
of
battle
was
deployed
upon
the
wings
or
a
part
was
held
in
reserve
the
celebrated
regulation
for
maneuvers
of
fixed
the
deployed
as
the
only
order
for
battle
it
seemed
to
admit
the
use
of
doubled
on
the
center
only
in
partial
combats
such
as
an
attack
upon
an
isolated
post
a
village
a
forest
or
small
intrenchments
the
insufficient
instruction
in
maneuvers
of
the
troops
of
the
republic
forced
the
generals
who
were
poor
tacticians
to
employ
in
battle
the
system
of
columns
supported
by
numerous
skirmishers
besides
this
the
nature
of
the
countries
which
formed
the
theaters
of
operations
the
vosges
alps
pyrenees
and
the
difficult
country
of
la
vendée
rendered
this
the
only
appropriate
system
how
would
it
have
been
possible
to
attack
the
camps
of
saorgio
figueras
and
with
deployed
regiments
in
napoleon
time
the
french
generally
used
the
system
of
columns
as
they
were
nearly
always
the
assailants
in
i
published
at
glogau
in
silesia
a
small
pamphlet
with
the
title
of
summary
of
the
general
principles
of
the
art
of
war
in
which
i
proposed
to
admit
for
the
attack
the
system
of
lines
formed
of
columns
of
battalions
by
divisions
of
two
companies
in
other
words
to
march
to
the
attack
in
lines
of
battalions
closed
in
mass
or
at
preceded
by
numerous
skirmishers
and
the
columns
being
separated
by
intervals
that
may
vary
between
that
necessary
for
the
deployment
of
a
battalion
and
the
minimum
of
the
front
of
one
column
what
i
had
recently
seen
in
the
campaigns
of
ulm
austerlitz
jena
and
eylau
had
convinced
me
of
the
difficulty
if
not
the
impossibility
of
marching
an
army
in
deployed
lines
in
either
two
or
three
ranks
to
attack
an
enemy
in
position
it
was
this
conviction
which
led
me
to
publish
the
pamphlet
above
referred
to
this
work
attracted
some
attention
not
only
on
account
of
the
treatise
on
strategy
but
also
on
account
of
what
was
said
on
tactics
the
successes
gained
by
wellington
in
spain
and
at
waterloo
with
troops
deployed
in
lines
of
two
ranks
were
generally
attributed
to
the
murderous
effect
of
the
and
created
doubt
in
some
minds
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
use
of
small
columns
but
it
was
not
till
after
that
the
controversies
on
the
best
formation
for
battle
wore
renewed
by
the
appearance
of
a
pamphlet
by
the
marquis
of
chambray
in
these
discussions
i
remarked
the
fatal
tendency
of
the
clearest
minds
to
reduce
every
system
of
war
to
absolute
forms
and
to
cast
in
the
same
mold
all
the
tactical
combinations
a
general
may
arrange
without
taking
into
consideration
localities
moral
circumstances
national
characteristics
or
the
abilities
of
the
commanders
i
had
proposed
to
use
lines
of
small
columns
especially
in
the
attack
i
never
intended
to
make
it
an
exclusive
system
particularly
for
the
defense
i
had
two
opportunities
of
being
convinced
that
this
formation
was
approved
of
by
the
greatest
generals
of
our
times
the
first
was
at
the
congress
of
vienna
in
the
latter
part
of
the
archduke
charles
observed
that
he
was
under
great
obligations
for
the
summary
i
had
published
in
which
general
walmoden
had
brought
to
him
in
from
silesia
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
of
the
prince
had
not
thought
it
possible
to
apply
the
formation
which
i
had
proposed
but
at
the
battle
of
essling
the
contracted
space
of
the
field
induced
him
to
form
a
part
of
his
army
in
columns
by
battalions
the
landwehr
particularly
and
they
resisted
admirably
the
furious
charges
of
the
cuirassiers
of
general
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
archduke
they
could
not
have
done
if
they
had
been
deployed
at
the
battle
of
wagram
the
greater
part
of
the
austrian
line
was
formed
in
the
same
way
as
at
essling
and
after
two
days
of
terrible
fighting
the
archduke
abandoned
the
field
of
battle
not
because
his
army
was
badly
beaten
but
because
his
left
was
outflanked
and
thrown
back
so
as
to
endanger
his
line
of
retreat
on
hungary
the
prince
was
satisfied
that
the
firm
bearing
of
his
troops
was
in
part
due
to
this
mixture
of
small
columns
with
deployed
battalions
the
second
witness
is
wellington
although
his
evidence
is
apparently
not
so
conclusive
having
been
presented
to
him
at
the
congress
of
verona
in
i
had
occasion
to
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
of
the
controversies
to
which
his
system
of
formation
for
battle
a
system
to
which
a
great
part
of
his
success
had
been
attributed
had
given
rise
he
remarked
that
he
was
convinced
the
manner
of
the
attack
of
the
french
upon
him
in
columns
more
or
less
deep
was
very
dangerous
against
a
solid
infantry
having
confidence
in
its
fire
and
well
supported
by
artillery
and
cavalry
i
observed
to
the
duke
that
these
deep
columns
were
very
different
from
the
small
columns
which
i
proposed
a
formation
which
insures
in
the
attack
steadiness
force
and
mobility
while
deep
masses
afford
no
greater
mobility
and
force
than
a
deployed
line
and
are
very
much
more
exposed
to
the
ravages
of
artillery
i
asked
the
illustrious
general
if
at
waterloo
he
had
not
formed
the
hanoverian
brunswick
and
belgian
troops
in
columns
by
battalions
he
answered
yes
because
i
could
not
depend
upon
them
so
well
as
upon
the
english
i
replied
that
this
admission
proved
that
he
thought
a
line
formed
of
columns
by
battalions
was
more
firm
than
long
deployed
lines
he
replied
they
are
certainly
good
also
but
their
use
always
depends
upon
the
localities
and
the
spirit
of
the
troops
a
general
can
not
act
in
the
same
manner
under
all
circumstances
to
this
illustrious
evidence
i
might
add
that
napoleon
himself
in
the
campaign
of
prescribed
for
the
attack
the
formation
of
the
infantry
in
columns
by
divisions
of
two
companies
in
two
ranks
as
the
most
suitable
which
was
identically
what
i
had
proposed
in
the
duke
of
wellington
also
admitted
that
the
french
columns
at
waterloo
particularly
those
of
their
right
wing
were
not
small
columns
of
battalions
but
enormous
masses
much
more
unwieldy
and
much
deeper
if
we
can
believe
the
prussian
accounts
and
plans
of
the
battle
it
would
seem
that
ney
four
divisions
were
formed
in
but
four
columns
at
least
in
their
march
to
the
attack
of
la
haye
sainte
and
the
line
extending
from
this
farm
to
the
papelotte
i
was
not
present
but
several
officers
have
assured
me
that
at
one
time
the
troops
were
formed
in
columns
by
divisions
of
two
brigades
each
the
battalions
being
deployed
behind
each
other
at
six
paces
interval
this
circumstance
demonstrates
how
much
is
wanting
in
the
military
terms
of
the
french
we
give
the
same
name
of
to
masses
of
four
regiments
and
to
fractions
of
a
battalion
of
two
companies
each
which
is
absurd
let
us
suppose
for
example
that
napoleon
had
directed
on
the
of
june
the
formation
of
the
line
in
columns
by
divisions
and
by
battalions
intending
that
the
regulation
of
should
be
followed
his
lieutenants
might
naturally
have
understood
it
very
differently
and
according
to
their
interpretation
of
the
order
would
have
executed
one
of
the
following
formations
either
the
four
divisions
of
the
right
wing
would
have
been
formed
in
four
large
masses
each
one
of
eight
or
twelve
battalions
according
to
the
strength
of
the
regiments
as
is
indicated
in
this
figure
for
eight
battalions
or
each
division
would
have
been
formed
in
eight
or
twelve
columns
of
battalions
by
divisions
of
two
platoons
or
companies
according
to
the
system
i
have
proposed
as
in
this
figure
viz
i
do
not
mean
to
assert
positively
that
this
confusion
of
words
led
to
the
deep
masses
at
waterloo
but
it
might
have
done
so
and
it
is
important
that
in
every
language
there
should
be
two
different
terms
to
express
two
such
different
things
as
a
of
twelve
battalions
and
a
of
a
quarter
of
a
battalion
struck
with
what
precedes
i
thought
it
proper
to
modify
my
summary
already
referred
to
which
was
too
concise
and
in
my
revision
of
it
i
devoted
a
chapter
to
the
discussion
of
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
different
formations
for
battle
i
also
added
some
considerations
relative
to
a
mixed
system
used
at
eylau
by
general
benningsen
which
consisted
in
forming
a
regiment
of
three
battalions
by
deploying
the
central
one
the
other
two
being
in
column
on
the
wings
after
these
discussions
i
drew
the
conclusions
that
wellington
system
was
certainly
good
for
the
defensive
that
the
system
of
benningsen
might
according
to
circumstances
be
as
good
for
the
offensive
as
for
the
defensive
since
it
was
successfully
used
by
napoleon
at
the
passage
of
the
tagliamento
that
the
most
skillful
tactician
would
experience
great
difficulty
in
marching
forty
or
fifty
deployed
battalions
in
two
or
three
ranks
over
an
interval
of
twelve
or
fifteen
hundred
yards
preserving
sufficient
order
to
attack
an
enemy
in
position
with
any
chance
of
success
the
front
all
the
while
being
played
upon
by
artillery
and
musketry
i
have
never
seen
any
thing
of
the
kind
in
my
experience
i
regard
it
as
impossible
and
am
convinced
that
such
a
line
could
not
advance
to
the
attack
in
sufficiently
good
order
to
have
the
force
necessary
for
success
napoleon
was
in
the
habit
of
addressing
his
marshals
in
these
terms
take
your
troops
up
in
good
order
and
make
a
vigorous
assault
upon
the
enemy
i
ask
what
means
is
there
of
carrying
up
to
the
assault
of
an
enemy
forty
or
fifty
deployed
battalions
as
a
whole
in
good
order
they
will
reach
the
enemy
in
detachments
disconnected
from
each
other
and
the
commander
can
not
exercise
any
control
over
the
mass
as
a
whole
i
saw
nothing
of
this
kind
either
at
ulm
jena
eylau
bautzen
dresden
culm
or
leipsic
neither
did
it
occur
at
austerlitz
friedland
katzbach
or
dennewitz
i
am
not
aware
that
wellington
in
any
of
his
battles
ever
marched
in
deployed
lines
to
the
attack
of
an
enemy
in
position
he
generally
awaited
the
attack
at
vittoria
and
toulouse
he
gained
the
victory
by
maneuvers
against
the
flanks
and
at
toulouse
soult
right
wing
was
beaten
while
descending
the
heights
to
attack
even
at
waterloo
what
fate
would
have
befallen
the
english
army
if
leaving
the
plateau
of
mont
it
had
marched
in
deployed
order
to
attack
napoleon
in
position
on
the
heights
of
la
belle
alliance
i
will
be
pardoned
for
these
recapitulations
as
they
seem
to
be
necessary
to
the
solution
of
a
question
which
has
arisen
since
my
summary
of
the
art
of
war
was
written
some
german
generals
recognizing
fully
the
advantages
derived
in
from
the
system
of
columns
of
battalions
have
endeavored
to
add
to
its
value
by
dividing
up
the
columns
and
increasing
their
number
so
as
to
make
them
more
shallow
and
to
facilitate
their
deployment
with
this
view
they
propose
instead
of
forming
four
divisions
or
companies
one
behind
the
other
to
place
them
beside
each
other
not
deployed
but
in
small
columns
that
is
if
the
battalion
consists
of
four
companies
of
two
hundred
and
forty
men
each
each
company
is
to
be
divided
into
four
sections
of
sixty
each
one
of
these
sections
will
be
dispersed
as
skirmishers
and
the
other
three
in
two
ranks
will
form
a
small
column
so
that
the
battalion
instead
of
forming
one
column
will
form
four
and
the
regiment
of
three
battalions
will
form
twelve
small
columns
instead
of
three
illustration
battalion
battalion
battalion
it
is
certain
that
it
would
be
easier
to
march
such
a
line
against
the
enemy
than
if
deployed
but
these
diminutive
columns
of
sixty
skirmishers
and
one
hundred
and
eighty
men
in
the
ranks
would
never
present
the
same
order
and
solidity
as
a
single
column
of
a
battalion
still
as
the
system
has
some
advantages
it
deserves
a
trial
and
indeed
it
has
already
been
practiced
in
prussia
and
austria
the
same
formation
applies
equally
to
battalions
of
six
or
eight
companies
in
this
case
the
battalion
would
not
be
formed
by
companies
but
by
divisions
of
two
companies
that
is
in
three
or
four
columns
according
to
the
number
of
companies
two
serious
inconveniences
appear
to
me
to
attach
to
each
of
these
formations
if
vigorously
charged
by
cavalry
these
small
subdivisions
would
be
in
great
danger
and
even
in
attacking
the
enemy
line
if
driven
back
and
pursued
disorder
would
be
more
likely
to
occur
than
in
the
columns
of
battalions
still
either
of
them
may
be
employed
according
to
circumstances
localities
and
the
of
the
troops
experience
alone
can
assign
to
each
its
proper
value
i
am
not
aware
whether
the
austrians
applied
these
columns
of
companies
at
custozza
and
novara
or
whether
these
maneuvers
have
only
been
practiced
in
their
camps
of
instruction
be
that
as
it
may
there
is
another
not
less
important
question
to
be
considered
will
the
adoption
of
the
rifled
and
improved
balls
bring
about
any
important
changes
in
the
formation
for
battle
and
the
now
recognized
principles
of
tactics
if
these
arms
aided
the
allies
at
the
alma
and
inkermann
it
was
because
the
russians
were
not
provided
with
them
and
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
in
a
year
or
two
all
armies
will
alike
be
furnished
with
them
so
that
in
future
the
advantage
will
not
be
confined
to
one
side
what
change
will
it
make
in
tactics
will
whole
armies
be
deployed
as
skirmishers
or
will
it
not
still
be
necessary
to
preserve
either
the
formation
of
lines
deployed
in
two
or
three
ranks
or
lines
of
battalions
in
columns
will
battles
become
mere
duels
with
the
rifle
where
the
parties
will
fire
upon
each
other
without
maneuvering
until
one
or
the
other
shall
retreat
or
be
destroyed
what
military
man
will
reply
in
the
affirmative
it
follows
therefore
that
to
decide
battles
maneuvers
are
necessary
and
victory
will
fall
to
the
general
who
maneuvers
most
skillfully
and
he
can
not
maneuver
except
with
deployed
lines
or
lines
of
columns
of
battalions
either
whole
or
subdivided
into
columns
of
one
or
two
companies
to
attempt
to
prescribe
by
regulation
under
what
circumstances
either
of
these
systems
is
to
be
applied
would
be
absurd
if
a
general
and
an
army
can
be
found
such
that
he
can
march
upon
the
enemy
in
a
deployed
line
of
forty
or
fifty
battalions
then
let
the
shallow
order
be
adopted
and
the
formation
in
columns
be
confined
to
the
attack
of
isolated
posts
but
i
freely
confess
that
i
would
never
accept
the
command
of
an
army
under
this
condition
the
only
point
for
a
regulation
for
the
formation
for
battle
is
to
forbid
the
use
of
very
deep
columns
because
they
are
heavy
and
difficult
to
move
and
to
keep
in
order
besides
they
are
so
much
exposed
to
artillery
that
their
destruction
seems
inevitable
and
their
great
depth
does
not
increase
in
any
respect
their
chances
of
success
if
the
organization
of
an
army
were
left
to
me
i
would
adopt
for
infantry
the
formation
in
two
ranks
and
a
regimental
organization
according
with
the
formation
for
battle
i
would
then
make
each
regiment
of
infantry
to
consist
of
three
battalions
and
a
depot
each
battalion
should
consist
of
six
companies
so
that
when
in
column
by
division
the
depth
would
be
three
divisions
or
six
ranks
this
formation
seems
most
reasonable
whether
it
is
desired
to
form
the
battalion
in
columns
of
attack
by
divisions
on
the
center
of
each
battalion
or
on
any
other
division
the
columns
of
attack
since
the
depth
is
only
six
ranks
would
not
be
so
much
exposed
to
the
fire
of
artillery
but
would
still
have
the
mobility
necessary
to
take
the
troops
up
in
good
order
and
launch
them
upon
the
enemy
with
great
force
the
deployment
of
these
small
columns
could
be
executed
with
great
ease
and
promptitude
and
for
the
forming
of
a
square
a
column
of
three
divisions
in
depth
would
be
preferable
in
several
respects
to
one
of
four
or
six
divisions
in
the
russian
service
each
battalion
consists
of
four
companies
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
each
each
company
being
as
strong
as
a
division
in
the
french
organization
the
maneuver
of
double
column
on
the
center
is
not
practicable
since
the
center
is
here
merely
an
interval
separating
the
second
and
third
companies
hence
the
column
must
be
simple
not
on
the
center
but
on
one
of
the
four
companies
something
analogous
to
the
double
column
on
the
center
would
be
attained
by
forming
the
first
and
fourth
companies
behind
the
second
and
third
respectively
but
then
the
formation
would
be
in
two
lines
rather
than
in
column
and
this
is
the
reason
why
i
would
prefer
the
organization
of
the
battalion
in
six
companies
or
three
divisions
by
dividing
each
of
the
four
companies
into
two
platoons
making
eight
in
all
the
formation
of
column
on
the
might
be
made
on
the
fourth
and
fifth
platoons
as
the
leading
division
but
then
each
division
would
be
composed
of
two
platoons
belonging
to
different
companies
so
that
each
captain
would
have
half
of
the
men
of
his
company
under
the
command
of
another
officer
and
half
of
his
own
division
would
be
made
up
of
another
company
such
an
arrangement
in
the
attack
would
be
very
inconvenient
for
as
the
captain
is
the
real
commander
father
and
judge
of
the
men
of
his
own
company
he
can
always
obtain
more
from
them
in
the
way
of
duty
than
any
stranger
in
addition
if
the
double
column
should
meet
with
a
decided
repulse
and
it
should
be
necessary
to
reform
it
in
line
it
would
be
difficult
to
prevent
disorder
the
platoons
being
obliged
to
run
from
one
side
to
the
other
to
find
their
companies
in
the
french
system
where
each
battalion
consists
of
eight
companies
forming
as
many
platoons
at
drill
this
objection
does
not
exist
since
each
company
is
conducted
by
its
own
captain
it
is
true
that
there
will
be
two
captains
of
companies
in
each
division
but
this
will
be
rather
an
advantage
than
the
reverse
since
there
will
be
a
rivalry
and
emulation
between
the
two
captains
and
their
men
which
will
lead
to
greater
display
of
bravery
besides
if
necessary
the
senior
captain
is
there
to
command
the
division
as
a
whole
it
is
time
to
leave
these
secondary
details
and
return
to
the
important
question
at
issue
since
i
have
alluded
to
the
system
adopted
by
wellington
it
is
proper
to
explain
it
so
that
it
can
be
estimated
at
its
true
value
in
the
light
of
historical
events
in
spain
and
portugal
particularly
wellington
had
under
his
command
a
mass
of
troops
of
the
country
in
which
he
placed
but
little
confidence
in
regular
formation
in
a
pitched
battle
on
account
of
their
want
of
instruction
and
discipline
but
which
were
animated
by
a
lively
hatred
of
the
french
and
formed
bodies
of
skirmishers
useful
in
harassing
the
enemy
having
learned
by
experience
the
effects
of
the
fury
and
impetuosity
of
the
french
columns
when
led
by
such
men
as
massena
and
ney
wellington
decided
upon
wise
means
of
weakening
this
impetuosity
and
afterward
securing
a
triumph
over
it
he
chose
positions
difficult
to
approach
and
covered
all
their
avenues
by
swarms
of
spanish
and
portuguese
riflemen
who
were
skilled
in
taking
advantage
of
the
inequalities
of
the
ground
he
placed
a
part
of
his
artillery
on
the
tactical
crest
of
his
position
and
a
part
more
to
the
rear
and
riddled
the
advancing
columns
with
a
murderous
artillery
and
musketry
fire
while
his
excellent
english
infantry
sheltered
from
the
fire
were
posted
a
hundred
paces
in
rear
of
the
crest
to
await
the
arrival
of
these
columns
and
when
the
latter
appeared
on
the
summit
wearied
out
of
breath
decimated
in
numbers
they
were
received
with
a
general
discharge
of
artillery
and
musketry
and
immediately
charged
by
the
infantry
with
the
bayonet
this
system
which
was
perfectly
rational
and
particularly
applicable
to
spain
and
portugal
since
he
had
there
great
numbers
of
this
kind
of
troops
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
rough
ground
upon
which
they
could
be
useful
as
marksmen
needed
some
modifications
to
make
it
applicable
to
belgium
at
waterloo
the
duke
took
his
position
on
a
plateau
with
a
gentle
slope
like
a
glacis
where
his
artillery
had
a
magnificent
field
of
fire
and
where
it
produced
a
terrible
effect
both
flanks
of
this
plateau
were
well
protected
wellington
from
the
crest
of
the
plateau
could
discover
the
slightest
movement
in
the
french
army
while
his
own
were
hidden
but
nevertheless
his
system
would
not
have
prevented
his
losing
the
battle
if
a
number
of
other
circumstances
had
not
come
to
his
aid
every
one
knows
more
or
less
correctly
the
events
of
this
terrible
battle
which
i
have
elsewhere
impartially
described
i
demonstrated
that
its
result
was
due
neither
to
the
nor
to
the
use
of
deployed
lines
by
the
english
but
to
the
following
accidental
causes
viz
to
the
mud
which
rendered
the
progress
of
the
french
in
the
attack
painful
and
slow
and
caused
their
first
attacks
to
be
less
effective
and
prevented
their
being
properly
sustained
by
the
artillery
to
the
original
formation
of
very
deep
columns
on
the
part
of
the
french
principally
on
the
right
wing
to
the
want
of
unity
in
the
employment
of
the
three
arms
the
infantry
and
cavalry
made
a
number
of
charges
alternating
with
each
other
but
they
were
in
no
case
simultaneous
finally
and
chiefly
to
the
unexpected
arrival
of
the
whole
prussian
army
at
the
decisive
moment
on
the
right
flank
if
not
the
rear
of
the
french
every
experienced
military
man
will
agree
that
in
spite
of
the
mud
and
the
firmness
of
the
english
infantry
if
the
mass
of
the
french
infantry
had
been
thrown
on
the
english
in
columns
of
battalions
immediately
after
the
great
charge
of
cavalry
the
combined
army
would
have
been
broken
and
forced
back
on
antwerp
independently
of
this
if
the
prussians
had
not
arrived
the
english
would
have
been
compelled
to
retreat
and
i
maintain
that
this
battle
can
not
justly
be
cited
as
proof
of
the
superiority
of
over
attacks
in
columns
from
all
these
discussions
we
may
draw
the
following
conclusions
viz
that
the
improvements
in
will
not
introduce
any
important
change
in
the
manner
of
taking
troops
into
battle
but
that
it
would
be
useful
to
introduce
into
the
tactics
of
infantry
the
formation
of
columns
by
companies
and
to
have
a
numerous
body
of
good
riflemen
or
skirmishers
and
to
exercise
the
troops
considerably
in
firing
those
armies
which
have
whole
regiments
of
light
infantry
may
distribute
them
through
the
different
brigades
but
it
would
be
preferable
to
detail
alternately
in
each
company
as
they
are
needed
which
would
be
practicable
when
the
troops
are
accustomed
to
firing
by
this
plan
the
regiments
could
be
employed
in
the
line
with
the
others
and
should
the
number
of
taken
from
the
companies
be
at
any
time
insufficient
they
could
be
reinforced
by
a
battalion
of
light
infantry
to
each
division
that
if
wellington
system
of
deployed
lines
and
be
excellent
for
the
defense
it
would
be
difficult
ever
to
employ
it
in
an
attack
upon
an
enemy
in
position
that
in
spite
of
the
improvements
of
two
armies
in
a
battle
will
not
pass
the
day
in
firing
at
each
other
from
a
distance
it
will
always
be
necessary
for
one
of
them
to
advance
to
the
attack
of
the
other
that
as
this
advance
is
necessary
success
will
depend
as
formerly
upon
the
most
skillful
maneuvering
according
to
the
principles
of
grand
tactics
which
consist
in
this
viz
in
knowing
how
to
direct
the
great
mass
of
the
troops
at
the
proper
moment
upon
the
decisive
point
of
the
and
in
employing
for
this
purpose
the
simultaneous
action
of
the
three
arms
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
add
much
to
what
has
been
said
on
this
subject
in
chapters
iv
and
and
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
define
by
regulation
an
absolute
system
of
formation
for
battle
that
victory
may
with
much
certainty
be
expected
by
the
party
taking
the
offensive
when
the
general
in
command
possesses
the
talent
of
taking
his
troops
into
action
in
good
order
and
of
boldly
attacking
the
enemy
adopting
the
system
of
formation
best
adapted
to
the
ground
to
the
spirit
and
quality
of
his
troops
and
to
his
own
character
finally
i
will
terminate
this
article
with
the
following
remark
that
war
far
from
being
an
exact
science
is
a
terrible
and
impassioned
drama
regulated
it
is
true
by
three
or
four
general
principles
but
also
dependent
for
its
results
upon
a
number
of
moral
and
physical
complications

sketch
of
the
principal
maritime
expeditions
i
have
thought
it
proper
to
give
here
an
account
of
the
principal
maritime
expeditions
to
be
taken
in
connection
with
maxims
on
descents
the
naval
forces
of
egypt
phoenicia
and
rhodes
are
the
earliest
mentioned
in
history
and
of
them
the
account
is
confused
the
persians
conquered
these
nations
as
well
as
asia
minor
and
became
the
most
formidable
power
on
both
land
and
sea
about
the
same
time
the
carthaginians
who
were
masters
of
the
coast
of
mauritania
being
invited
by
the
inhabitants
of
cadiz
passed
the
straits
colonized
boetica
and
took
possession
of
the
balearic
isles
and
sardinia
and
finally
made
a
descent
on
sicily
the
greeks
contended
against
the
persians
with
a
success
that
could
not
have
been
expected
although
no
country
was
ever
more
favorably
situated
for
a
naval
power
than
greece
with
her
fifty
islands
and
her
great
extent
of
coast
the
merchant
marine
of
athens
produced
her
prosperity
and
gave
her
the
naval
power
to
which
greece
was
indebted
for
her
independence
her
fleets
united
with
those
of
the
islands
were
under
themistocles
the
terror
of
the
persians
and
the
rulers
of
the
east
they
never
made
grand
descents
because
their
were
not
in
proportion
to
their
naval
strength
had
greece
been
a
united
government
instead
of
a
confederation
of
republics
and
had
the
navies
of
athens
syracuse
corinth
and
sparta
been
combined
instead
of
fighting
among
each
other
it
is
probable
that
the
greeks
would
have
conquered
the
world
before
the
romans
if
we
can
believe
the
exaggerated
traditions
of
the
old
greek
historians
the
famous
army
of
xerxes
had
not
less
than
four
thousand
vessels
and
this
number
is
astonishing
even
when
we
read
the
account
of
them
by
herodotus
it
is
more
difficult
to
believe
that
at
the
same
time
and
by
a
concerted
movement
five
thousand
other
vessels
landed
three
hundred
thousand
carthaginians
in
sicily
where
they
were
totally
defeated
by
gelon
on
the
same
day
that
themistocles
destroyed
the
fleet
of
xerxes
at
salamis
three
other
expeditions
under
hannibal
imilcon
and
hamilcar
carried
into
sicily
from
one

this
was
two
hundred
and
eighty
years
before
the
christian
era
conqueror
of
the

long
time
profited

wars
between
carthage
and
rome
now
the
preponderating
power
in
italy
were
the
most
celebrated
in
the
maritime
annals
of
antiquity
the
romans
were
particularly
remarkable
for
the
rapidity
with
which
they
improved
and
increased
their
marine
in
the
year
their
boats
or
vessels
were
scarcely
fit
to
cross
to
sicily
and
eight
years
after
found
regulus
conqueror
at
ecnomos
with
three
hundred
and
forty
large
vessels
each
with
three
hundred
rowers
and
one
hundred
and
twenty
combatants
making
in
all
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
men
the
carthaginians
it
is
said
were
stronger
by
twelve
to
fifteen
thousand
men
and
fifty
vessels
the
victory
of
ecnomos
perhaps
more
extraordinary
than
that
of
actium
was
the
first
important
step
of
the
romans
toward
universal
empire
the
subsequent
descent
in
africa
consisted
of
forty
thousand
men
but
the
greater
part
of
this
force
being
recalled
to
sicily
the
remainder
was
overthrown
and
regulus
being
made
prisoner
became
as
celebrated
by
his
death
as
by
his
famous
victory
the
great
fleet
which
was
to
avenge
him
was
successful
at
clypea
but
was
destroyed
on
its
return
by
a
storm
and
its
successor
met
the
same
fate
at
cape
palinuro
in
the
year
the
romans
were
defeated
at
drepanum
and
lost
thousand
men
and
more
than
one
hundred
vessels
another
fleet
on
its
way
to
besiege
lilybæum
in
the
same
year
was
lost
off
cape
pactyrus
discouraged
by
this
succession
of
disasters
the
senate
at
first
resolved
to
renounce
the
sea
but
observing
that
the
power
of
sicily
and
spain
resulted
from
their
maritime
superiority
it
concluded
to
arm
its
fleets
again
and
in
the
year
lutatius
catullus
set
out
with
three
hundred
galleys
and
seven
hundred
transports
for
drepanum
and
gained
the
battle
in
the
ægates
islands
in
which
the
carthaginians
lost
one
hundred
and
twenty
vessels
this
victory
brought
to
a
close
the
first
punic
war
the
second
distinguished
by
hannibal
expedition
to
italy
was
less
maritime
in
its
character
scipio
however
bore
the
roman
eagles
to
cartagena
and
by
its
capture
destroyed
forever
the
empire
of
the
carthaginians
in
spain
finally
he
carried
the
war
into
africa
with
a
force
inferior
to
that
of
regulus
but
still
he
succeeded
in
gaining
the
battle
of
zama
imposing
a
shameful
peace
on
carthage
and
burning
five
hundred
of
her
ships
subsequently
scipio
brother
crossed
the
hellespont
with
thousand
men
and
at
magnesia
gained
the
celebrated
victory
which
surrendered
to
the
mercy
of
the
romans
the
kingdom
of
antiochus
and
all

this
expedition
was
aided
by

victory

by
the
combined
fleets
of

over
the
navy
of

decided
the
fate
of

the
important
port
of

having
been
given
up
to

romans
an
immense

was
employed
in

carthage
was
besieged
and
the
son
of

the
glory
of
completing
the
victory
which

scipio
had
begun
by
destroying
the
bitter
rival
of
his
country
after
this
triumph
the
power
of
rome
in
africa
as
well
as
in
europe
was
supreme
but
her
empire
in
asia
was
for
a
moment
shaken
by
mithridates
this
powerful
king
after
seizing
in
succession
the
small
adjacent
states
was
in
command
of
not
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
and
of
a
fleet
of
four
hundred
vessels
of
which
three
hundred
were
decked
he
defeated
the
three
roman
generals
who
commanded
in
cappadocia
invaded
asia
minor
and
massacred
there
at
least
eighty
thousand
roman
subjects
and
even
sent
a
large
army
into
greece
sylla
landed
in
greece
with
a
reinforcement
of
thousand
romans
and
retook
athens
but
mithridates
sent
in
succession
two
large
armies
by
the
bosporus
and
the
dardanelles
the
first
one
hundred
thousand
strong
was
destroyed
at
chæronea
and
the
second
of
eighty
thousand
men
met
a
similar
fate
at
orchomenus
at
the
same
time
lucullus
having
collected
all
the
maritime
resources
of
the
cities
of
asia
minor
the
islands
and
particularly
of
rhodes
was
prepared
to
transport
sylla
army
from

and
mithridates
from
fear
made
peace
in
the
second
and
third
wars
respectively
conducted
by

there
were
no
descents
effected
mithridates
driven
step
by
step
into
colchis
and
no
longer
able
to
keep
the
sea
conceived
the
project
of
turning
the
black
sea
by
the
caucasus
in
order
to
pass
through
thrace
to
assume
the
offensive
a
policy
which
it
is
difficult
to
understand
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
was
unable
to
defend
his
kingdom
against
fifty
thousand
romans
cæsar
in
his
second
descent
on
england
had
six
hundred
vessels
transporting
forty
thousand
men
during
the
civil
wars
he
transported
thousand
men
to
greece
antony
came
from
brundusium
to
join
him
with
twenty
thousand
men
and
passed
through
the
fleet
of
pompey
in
which
act
he
was
as
much
favored
by
the
lucky
star
of
cæsar
as
by
the
arrangements
of
his
lieutenants
afterward
cæsar
carried
an
army
of
sixty
thousand
men
to
africa
they
did
not
however
go
in
a
body
but
in
successive
detachments
the
greatest
armament
of
the
latter
days
of
the
roman
republic
was
that
of
augustus
who
transported
eighty
thousand
men
and
twelve
thousand
horses
into
greece
to
oppose
antony
for
besides
the
numerous
transports
required
for
such
an
army
there
were
two
hundred
and
sixty
vessels
of
war
to
protect
them
antony
was
superior
in
force
on
land
but
trusted
the
empire
of
the
world
to
a
naval
battle
he
had
one
hundred
and
seventy
in
addition
to
sixty
of
galleys
the
whole
manned
by
thousand
choice
troops
besides
the
necessary
rowers
later
germanicus
conducted
an
expedition
of
one
thousand
vessels
carrying
sixty
thousand
men
from
the
mouths
of
the
rhine
to
the
mouths
of
the
ems
half
of
this
fleet
was
destroyed
on
its
return
by
a
storm
and
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
germanicus
controlling
both
banks
of
the
rhine
should
have
exposed
his
army
to
the
chances
of
the
sea
when
he
could
have
reached
the
same
point
by
land
in
a
few
days
when
the
roman
authority
extended
from
the
rhine
to
the
euphrates
maritime
expeditions
were
rare
and
the
great
contest
with
the
races
of
the
north
of
europe
which
began
after
the
division
of
the
empire
gave
employment
to
the
roman
armies
on
the
sides
of
germany
and
thrace
the
eastern
fraction
of
the
empire
still
maintained
a
powerful
navy
which
the
possession
of
the
islands
of
the
archipelago
made
a
necessity
while
at
the
same
time
it
afforded
the
means
the
first
five
centuries
of
the
christian
era
afford
but
few
events
of
interest
in
maritime
warfare
the
vandals
having
acquired
spain
landed
in
africa
eighty
thousand
strong
under
genseric
they
were
defeated
by
belisarius
but
holding
the
balearic
isles
and
sicily
they
controlled
the
mediterranean
for
a
time
at
the
very
epoch
when
the
nations
of
the
east
invaded
europe
the
scandinavians
began
to
land
on
the
coast
of
england
their
operations
are
little
better
known
than
those
of
the
barbarians
they
are
hidden
in
the
mysteries
of
odin
the
scandinavian
bards
attribute
two
thousand
five
hundred
vessels
to
sweden
less
poetical
accounts
assign
nine
hundred
and
seventy
to
the
danes
and
three
hundred
to
norway
these
frequently
acted
in
concert
the
swedes
naturally
turned
their
attention
to
the
head
of
the
baltic
and
drove
the
varangians
into
russia
the
danes
more
favorably
situated
with
respect
to
the
north
sea
directed
their
course
toward
the
coasts
of
france
and
england
if
the
account
cited
by
depping
is
correct
the
greater
part
of
these
vessels
were
nothing
more
than
fishermen
boats
manned
by
a
score
of
rowers
there
were
also
with
twenty
banks
or
forty
rowers
the
largest
had
banks
of
rowers
the
incursions
of
the
danes
who
had
long
before
ascended
the
seine
and
loire
lead
us
to
infer
that
the
greater
part
of
these
vessels
were
very
small
however
hengist
invited
by
the
briton
vortigern
transported
five
thousand
saxons
to
england
in
eighteen
vessels
which
would
go
to
show
that
there
were
then
also
large
vessels
or
that
the
marine
of
the
elbe
was
superior
to
that
of
the
scandinavians
between
the
years
and
three
new
expeditions
under
ida
and
cridda
gained
england
for
the
saxons
who
divided
it
into
seven
kingdoms
and
it
was
not
until
three
centuries
had
elapsed
that
they
were
again
united
under
the
authority
of
egbert
the
african
races
in
their
turn
visited
the
south
of
europe
in
the
moors
crossed
the
straits
of
gibraltar
under
the
lead
of
tarik
they
came
five
thousand
strong
at
the
invitation
of
count
julian
and
far
from
meeting
great
resistance
they
were
welcomed
by
the
numerous
enemies
of
the
visigoths
this
was
the
happy
era
of
the
caliphs
and
the
arabs
might
well
pass
for
liberators
in
comparison
with
the
tyrants
of
the
north
tarik
army
soon
swelled
to
twenty
thousand
men
defeated
rodrigo
at
jerez
and
reduced
the
kingdom
to
submission
in
time
several
millions
of
the
inhabitants
of
mauritania
crossed
the
sea
and
settled
in
spain
and
if
their
numerous
migrations
can
not
be
regarded
as
descents
still
they
form
one
of
the
most
curious
and
interesting
scenes
in
history
occurring
between
the
incursions
of
the
vandals
in
africa
and
the
crusades
in
the
east
a
revolution
not
less
important
and
one
which
has
left
more
durable
traces
marked
in
the
north
the
establishment
of
the
vast
empire
now
known
as
russia
the
varangian
princes
invited
by
the
novgorodians
of
whom
rurik
was
the
chief
soon
signalized
themselves
by
great
expeditions
in
oleg
is
said
to
have
embarked
eighty
thousand
men
in
two
thousand
boats
on
the
dnieper
they
passed
the
falls
of
the
river
and
debouched
in
the
black
sea
while
their
cavalry
followed
the
banks
they
proceeded
to
constantinople
and
forced
leo
the
philosopher
to
pay
tribute
forty
years
subsequently
igor
took
the
same
route
with
a
fleet
said
to
have
consisted
of
ten
thousand
boats
near
constantinople
his
fleet
terrified
by
the
effects
of
the
greek
fire
was
driven
on
the
coast
of
asia
where
the
force
was
disembarked
it
was
defeated
and
the
expedition
returned
home
not
discouraged
igor
his
fleet
and
army
and
descended
to
the
mouths
of
the
danube
where
the
emperor
romanus
sent
to
renew
the
tribute
and
ask
for
peace
in
svatoslav
favored
by
the
quarrel
of
nicephorus
with
the
king
of
bulgaria
embarked
sixty
thousand
men
debouched
into
the
black
sea
ascended
the
danube
and
seized
bulgaria
recalled
by
the
petchenegs
who
were
menacing
kiew
he
entered
into
alliance
with
them
and
returned
into
bulgaria
broke
his
alliance
with
the
greeks
and
being
reinforced
by
the
hungarians
crossed
the
balkan
and
marched
to
attack
adrianople
the
throne
of
constantine
was
held
by
zimisces
who
was
worthy
of
his
position
instead
of
purchasing
safety
by
paying
tribute
as
his
predecessors
had
done
he
raised
one
hundred
thousand
men
armed
a
respectable
fleet
repulsed
svatoslav
at
adrianople
obliged
him
to
retreat
to
silistria
and
took
by
assault
the
capital
of
the
bulgarians
the
russian
prince
marched
to
meet
him
and
gave
battle
not
far
from
silistria
but
was
obliged
to
the
place
where
he
sustained
one
of
the
most
memorable
sieges
recorded
in
history
in
a
second
and
still
more
bloody
battle
the
russians
performed
prodigies
of
valor
but
were
again
compelled
to
yield
to
numbers
zimisces
honoring
courage
finally
concluded
an
advantageous
treaty
about
this
period
the
danes
were
attracted
to
england
by
the
hope
of
pillage
and
we
are
told
that
lothaire
called
their
king
ogier
to
france
to
be
avenged
of
his
brothers
the
first
success
of
these
pirates
increased
their
fondness
for
this
sort
of
adventure
and
for
five
or
six
years
their
bands
swarmed
on
the
coasts
of
france
and
britain
and
devastated
the
country
ogier
hastings
regner
and
sigefroi
conducted
them
sometimes
to
the
mouths
of
the
seine
sometimes
to
the
mouths
of
the
loire
and
finally
to
those
of
the
garonne
it
is
even
asserted
that
hastings
entered
the
mediterranean
and
ascended
the
rhone
to
avignon
but
this
is
to
say
the
least
doubtful
the
strength
of
their
fleets
is
not
known
the
largest
seems
to
have
been
of
three
hundred
sail
in
the
beginning
of
the
tenth
century
rollo
at
first
landed
in
england
but
finding
little
chance
of
success
against
alfred
he
entered
into
alliance
with
him
landed
in
neustria
in
and
advanced
from
rouen
on
paris
other
bodies
marched
from
nantes
on
chartres
repulsed
here
rollo
overran
and
ravaged
the
neighboring
provinces
charles
the
simple
saw
no
better
means
of
delivering
his
kingdom
of
this
scourge
than
to
offer
rollo
the
fine
province
of
neustria
on
condition
that
he
would
marry
his
daughter
and
turn
christian
an
offer
which
was
eagerly
accepted
thirty
years
later
rollo
annoyed
by
the
successors
of
charles
called
to
his
aid
the
king
of
denmark
the
latter
landed
in
considerable
force
defeated
the
french
took
the
king
prisoner
and
assured
rollo
son
in
the
possession
of
normandy
during
the
same
interval
to
the
danes
exhibited
even
greater
hostility
toward
england
than
to
france
although
they
were
much
more
assimilated
to
the
saxons
than
to
the
french
in
language
and
customs
ivar
after
pillaging
the
kingdom
established
his
family
in
northumberland
alfred
the
great
at
first
beaten
by
ivar
successors
succeeded
in
regaining
his
throne
and
in
compelling
the
submission
of
the
danes
the
aspect
of
affairs
changes
anew
sweyn
still
more
fortunate
than
ivar
after
conquering
and
devastating
england
granted
peace
on
condition
that
a
sum
of
money
should
be
paid
and
returned
to
denmark
leaving
a
part
of
his
army
behind
him
ethelred
who
had
weakly
disputed
with
sweyn
what
remained
of
the
saxon
power
thought
he
could
not
do
better
to
free
himself
from
his
importunate
guests
than
to
order
a
simultaneous
massacre
of
all
the
danes
in
the
kingdom
but
sweyn
reappeared
in
the
following
year
at
the
head
of
an
imposing
force
and
between
and
three
successive
fleets
effected
disembarkations
on
the
coast
and
unfortunate
england
was
ravaged
anew
in
sweyn
landed
at
the
mouth
of
the
humber
and
again
swept
over
the
land
like
a
torrent
and
the
english
tired
of
obedience
to
kings
who
could
not
defend
them
recognized
him
as
king
of
the
north
his
son
canute
the
great
had
to
contend
with
a
rival
more
worthy
of
him
edmund
ironside
returning
from
denmark
at
the
head
of
a
considerable
force
and
aided
by
the
perfidious
edric
canute
ravaged
the
southern
part
of
england
and
threatened
london
a
new
division
of
the
kingdom
resulted
but
edmund
having
been
assassinated
by
edric
canute
was
finally
recognized
as
king
of
all
england
afterward
he
sailed
to
conquer
norway
from
which
country
he
returned
to
attack
scotland
when
he
died
he
divided
the
kingdom
between
his
three
children
according
to
the
usage
of
the
times
five
years
after
canute
death
the
english
assigned
the
crown
to
their
princes
but
edward
to
whom
it
fell
was
better
fitted
to
be
a
monk
than
to
save
a
kingdom
a
prey
to
such
commotions
he
died
in
leaving
to
harold
a
crown
which
the
chief
of
the
normans
settled
in
france
contested
with
him
and
to
whom
it
is
said
edward
had
made
a
cession
of
the
kingdom
unfortunately
for
harold
this
chief
was
a
great
and
ambitious
man
the
year
was
marked
by
two
extraordinary
expeditions
while
william
the
conqueror
was
preparing
in
normandy
a
formidable
armament
against
harold
the
brother
of
the
latter
having
been
driven
from
northumberland
for
his
crimes
sought
support
in
norway
and
with
the
king
of
norway
set
out
with
thirty
thousand
men
on
five
hundred
vessels
and
landed
at
the
mouth
of
the
humber
harold
almost
entirely
destroyed
this
force
in
a
bloody
battle
fought
near
york
but
a
more
formidable
storm
was
about
to
burst
upon
his
head
william
took
advantage
of
the
time
when
the
king
was
fighting
the
norwegians
to
sail
from
valery
with
a
very
large
armament
hume
asserts
that
he
had
three
thousand
transports
while
other
authorities
reduce
the
number
to
twelve
hundred
carrying
from
sixty
to
seventy
thousand
men
harold
hastened
from
york
and
fought
a
decisive
battle
near
hastings
in
which
he
met
an
honorable
death
and
his
fortunate
rival
soon
reduced
the
country
to
submission
at
the
same
time
another
william
surnamed
robert
guiscard
and
his
brother
roger
conquered
calabria
and
sicily
with
a
handful
of
troops
to
scarcely
thirty
years
after
these
memorable
events
an
enthusiastic
priest
animated
europe
with
a
fanatical
frenzy
and
precipitated
large
forces
upon
asia
to
conquer
the
holy
land
at
first
followed
by
one
hundred
thousand
men
afterward
by
two
hundred
thousand
vagabonds
who
perished
in
great
part
under
the
attacks
of
the
hungarians
bulgarians
and
greeks
peter
the
hermit
succeeded
in
crossing
the
bosporus
and
arrived
before
nice
with
from
fifty
to
sixty
thousand
men
who
were
either
killed
or
captured
by
the
saracens
an
expedition
more
military
in
its
character
succeeded
this
campaign
of
religious
pilgrims
one
hundred
thousand
men
composed
of
french
burgundians
germans
and
inhabitants
of
lorraine
under
godfrey
of
bouillon
marched
through
austria
on
constantinople
an
equal
number
under
the
count
of
toulouse
marched
by
lyons
italy
dalmatia
and
macedonia
and
bohemond
prince
of
tarentum
embarked
with
a
force
of
normans
sicilians
and
italians
and
took
the
route
by
greece
on
gallipolis
this
extensive
migration
reminds
us
of
the
fabulous
expeditions
of
xerxes
the
genoese
venetian
and
greek
fleets
were
chartered
to
transport
these
swarms
of
crusaders
by
the
bosporus
or
dardanelles
to
asia
more
than
four
hundred
thousand
men
were
concentrated
on
the
plains
of
nice
where
they
avenged
the
defeat
of
their
predecessors
godfrey
afterward
led
them
across
asia
and
syria
as
far
as
jerusalem
where
he
founded
a
kingdom
all
the
maritime
resources
of
greece
and
the
flourishing
republics
of
italy
were
required
to
transport
these
masses
across
the
bosporus
and
in
provisioning
them
during
the
siege
of
nice
and
the
great
impulse
thus
given
to
the
coast
states
of
italy
was
perhaps
the
most
advantageous
result
of
the
crusades
this
temporary
success
of
the
crusaders
became
the
source
of
great
disasters
the
mussulmans
heretofore
divided
among
themselves
united
to
resist
the
infidel
and
divisions
began
to
appear
in
the
christian
camps
a
new
expedition
was
necessary
to
aid
the
kingdom
which
the
brave
noureddin
was
threatening
louis
vii
and
the
emperor
conrad
each
at
the
head
of
one
hundred
thousand
crusaders
marched
as
their
predecessors
had
done
by
the
route
of
constantinople
but
the
greeks
frightened
by
the
recurring
visits
of
these
menacing
guests
plotted
their
destruction
conrad
who
was
desirous
of
being
first
fell
into
the
traps
laid
for
him
by
the
turks
and
was
defeated
in
detachments
in
several
battles
by
the
sultan
of
iconium
louis
more
fortunate
defeated
the
turks
on
the
banks
of
the
mender
but
being
deprived
of
the
support
of
conrad
and
his
army
being
annoyed
and
partially
beaten
by
the
enemy
in
the
passage
of
defiles
and
being
in
want
of
supplies
he
was
confined
to
attalia
on
the
coast
of
pamphylia
where
he
endeavored
to
embark
his
army
the
means
furnished
by
the
greeks
were
insufficient
and
not
more
than
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
men
arrived
at
antioch
with
the
king
the
remainder
either
perished
or
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
saracens
this
feeble
reinforcement
soon
melted
away
under
the
attacks
of
the
climate
and
the
daily
contests
with
the
enemy
although
they
were
continually
aided
by
small
bodies
brought
over
from
europe
by
the
italian
ships
and
they
were
again
about
to
yield
under
the
attacks
of
saladin
when
the
court
of
rome
succeeded
in
effecting
an
alliance
between
the
emperor
frederick
barbarossa
and
the
kings
of
france
and
england
to
save
the
holy
land
the
emperor
was
the
first
to
set
out
at
the
head
of
one
hundred
thousand
germans
he
opened
a
passage
through
thrace
in

of
the
formal
resistance

immense
fleets
the

seized
cyprus
and
both
landed
in

where
they
would
probably
have
triumphed
but
for
the
rivalry
which
sprang
up
between
them
in

of
which
philip
returned
to

twelve
years
later
a

they
assailed
it

the

irritated
by

giving

to
the

this

proceeded
to

having
there
collected
a
still
larger
force
set
out
according
to
statement
with
more
than
eighteen
hundred

twenty

mounted
it
should
be
stated
that
the
count
of
poictiers
had
arrived
also
with
troops
from

the
sad
fortune
experienced
by
this
splendid
army
did
not
prevent
the
same
king
from
engaging
in
a
new
crusade
twenty
years
later
he
disembarked
upon
that
occasion
at
the
ruins
of

and
besieged

the
plague
swept
off
half
his
army
in
a
few
months
and
himself
was
one
of
its
victims
the

having
arrived
with
powerful
reinforcements
at
the
time
of
louis
death
and
desiring
to
carry
back
the
remains
of
the
army
to
his
island
of
sicily
encountered
a
tempest
which
caused
a
loss
of
four
thousand
men
and
twenty
large
ships
this
prince
was
not
deterred
by
this
misfortune
from
desiring
the
conquest
of
the
greek
empire
and
of
constantinople
which
seemed
a
prize
of
greater
value
and
more
readily
obtained
philip
the
son
and
successor
of
saint
louis
being
anxious
to
return
to
france
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
project
this
was
the
last
effort
the
christians
who
were
abandoned
in
syria
were
destroyed
in
the
noted
attacks
of
tripoli
and
ptolemais
some
of
the
remnants
of
the
religious
orders
took
refuge
at
cyprus
and
established
themselves
at

the

in
their
turn
crossed
the

at

in
and
took
possession
one
after
the
other
of
the
european
provinces
of
the
eastern
empire
to
which
the
latins
had
themselves
given
the
fatal
blow
mohammed
while

to
have
had
his
fleet
transported
by
land
with
a
view
to
placing
it
in

canal
and
closing
the

it
is
stated
to
have
been
large
enough
to
be
manned
by
twenty
thousand

after
the
capture
of
this
capital
mohammed
found
his
means
increased
by
all
those
of
the
greek
navy
and
in
a
short
time
his
empire
attained
the
first
rank
of
maritime
powers
he
ordered
an
attack
to
be
made
upon
rhodes
and
upon
otranto
on
the
italian
main
whilst
he
proceeded
to
hungary
in

of
a
more
worthy
opponent
hunniades
repulsed
and
wounded
at
belgrade
the
sultan
fell
upon
trebizond
with
a
numerous
fleet
brought
that
city
to
sue
for
terms
and
then
proceeded
with
a
fleet
of
four
hundred
sail
to
make
a
landing
upon
the
island
of
negropont
which
he
carried
by
assault
a

upon
rhodes
executed
it
is
stated
at
the
head
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
by
one
of
his
ablest
lieutenants
was
a
failure
with
loss
to
the
assailants
mohammed
was
preparing
to
go
to
that
point
himself
with
an
immense
army
assembled
on
the
shores
of
ionia
which
vertot
estimates
at
three
hundred
thousand
men
but
death
closed
his
career
and
the
project
was
not
carried
into
effect
about
the
same
period
england
began
to
be
formidable
to
her
neighbors
on
land
as
well
as
on
the
sea
the
dutch
also
reclaiming
their
country
from
the
inroads
of
the
sea
were
laying
the
foundations
of
a
power
more
extraordinary
even
than
that
of
venice
edward
iii
landed
in
france
and
besieged
calais
with
eight
hundred
ships
and
forty
thousand
men
henry
made
two
descents
in
and
he
had
it
is
stated
fifteen
hundred
vessels
and
only
thirty
thousand
men
of
whom
six
thousand
were
cavalry
all
the
events
we
have
described
as
taking
place
up
to
this
period
and
including
the
capture
of
constantinople
were
before
the
invention
of
gunpowder
for
if
henry
had
cannon
at
agincourt
as
is
claimed
by
some
writers
they
were
certainly
not
used
in
naval
warfare
from
that
time
all
the
combinations
of
naval
armaments
were
entirely
changed
and
this
revolution
took
place
if
i
may
use
that
expression
at
the
time
when
the
invention
of
the
mariner
compass
and
the
discovery
of
america
and
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
were
about
to
turn
the
maritime
commerce
of
the
world
into
new
channels
and
to
establish
an
entirely
new
system
of
colonial
dependencies
i
shall
not
mention
in
detail
the
expeditions
of
the
spaniards
to
america
or
those
of
the
portuguese
dutch
and
english
to
india
by
doubling
the
cape
of
good
hope
notwithstanding
their
great
influence
upon
the
commerce
of
the
world
notwithstanding
the
genius
of
gama
albuquerque
and
cortez
these
expeditions
undertaken
by
small
bodies
of
two
or
three
thousand
men
against
tribes
who
knew
nothing
of
are
of
no
interest
in
a
military
point
of
view
the
spanish
navy
whose
fame
had
been
greatly
increased
by
this
discovery
of
a
new
world
was
at
the
height
of
its
splendor
in
the
reign
of
charles
however
the
glory
of
the
expedition
to
tunis
which
was
conquered
by
this
prince
at
the
head
of
thirty
thousand
fine
soldiers
transported
in
five
hundred
genoese
or
spanish
vessels
was
balanced
by
the
disaster
which
befell
a
similar
expedition
against
algiers
undertaken
when
the
season
was
too
far
advanced
and
in
opposition
to
the
wise
counsels
of
admiral
doria
the
expedition
was
scarcely
under
way
when
the
emperor
saw
one
hundred
and
sixty
of
his
ships
and
eight
thousand
men
swallowed
up
by
the
waves
the
remainder
was
saved
by
the
skill
of
doria
and
assembled
at
cape
metafuz
where
charles
himself
arrived
after
encountering
great
difficulties
and
peril
while
these
events
were
transpiring
the
successors
of
mohammed
were
not
neglecting
the
advantages
given
them
by
the
possession
of
so
many
fine
maritime
provinces
which
taught
them
at
once
the
importance
of
the
control
of
the
sea
and
furnished
means
for
obtaining
it
at
this
period
the
turks
were
quite
as
well
informed
with
reference
to
artillery
and
the
military
art
in
general
as
the
europeans
they
reached
the
apex
of
their
greatness
under
solyman
who
besieged
and
captured
rhodes
with
an
army
stated
to
have
reached
the
number
of
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
men
which
was
still
formidable
even
upon
the
supposition
of
its
strength
being
exaggerated
by
in
mustapha
and
the
celebrated
dragut
made
a
descent
upon
malta
where
the
knights
of
rhodes
had
made
a
new
establishment
they
carried
over
thousand
janissaries
with
one
hundred
and
forty
ships
john
of
valetta
as
is
well
known
gained
an
enduring
fame
by
repulsing
them
a
more
formidable
expedition
consisting
of
two
hundred
vessels
and
thousand
men
was
sent
in
to
the
isle
of
cyprus
where
nicosia
was
taken
and
famagosta
besieged
the
horrible
cruelties
practiced
by
mustapha
increased
the
alarm
occasioned
by
his
progress
spain
venice
naples
and
malta
united
their
naval
forces
to
succor
cyprus
but
famagosta
had
already
surrendered
notwithstanding
the
heroic
defense
of
bragadino
who
was
perfidiously
flayed
alive
by
mustapha
order
to
avenge
the
death
of
forty
thousand
turks
that
had
perished
in
the
space
of
two
years
spent
on
the
island
the
allied
fleet
under
the
orders
of
two
heroes
don
john
of
austria
brother
of
philip
and
andrea
doria
attacked
the
turkish
fleet
at
the
entrance
of
the
gulf
of
lepanto
near
the
promontory
of
actium
where
antony
and
augustus
once
fought
for
the
empire
of
the
world
the
turkish
fleet
was
almost
entirely
destroyed
more
than
two
hundred
vessels
and
thirty
thousand
turks
were
captured
or
perished
this
victory
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
supremacy
of
the
turks
but
was
a
great
check
in
their
career
of
greatness
however
they
made
such
vigorous
efforts
that
as
large
a
fleet
as
the
former
one
was
sent
to
sea
during
the
next
year
peace
terminated
this
contest
in
which
such
enormous
losses
were
sustained
the
bad
fortune
of
charles
in
his
expedition
against
algiers
did
not
deter
sebastian
of
portugal
from
wishing
to
attempt
the
conquest
of
morocco
where
he
was
invited
by
a
moorish
prince
who
had
been
deprived
of
his
estates
having
disembarked
upon
the
shores
of
morocco
at
the
head
of
twenty
thousand
men
this
young
prince
was
killed
and
his
army
cut
to
pieces
at
the
battle
of
alcazar
by
muley
abdulmalek
in
philip
whose
pride
had
increased
since
the
naval
battle
of
lepanto
on
account
of
the
success
he
had
gained
in
france
by
his
diplomacy
and
by
the
folly
of
the
adherents
of
the
league
deemed
his
arms
irresistible
he
thought
to
bring
england
to
his
feet
the
invincible
armada
intended
to
produce
this
effect
which
has
been
so
famous
was
composed
of
an
expeditionary
force
proceeding
from
cadiz
including
according
to
hume
narrative
one
hundred
and
vessels
armed
with
two
thousand
six
hundred
and
thirty
bronze
cannon
and
carrying
twenty
thousand
soldiers
in
addition
to
eleven
thousand
sailors
to
these
forces
was
to
be
added
an
army
of
thousand
men
which
the
duke
of
parma
was
to
bring
up
from
the
netherlands
by
way
of
ostend
a
tempest
and
the
efforts
of
the
english
caused
the
failure
of
this
expedition
which
although
of
considerable
magnitude
for
the
period
when
it
appeared
was
by
no
means
entitled
to
the
name
it
received
it
lost
thirteen
thousand
men
and
half
the
vessels
before
it
even
came
near
the
english
coast
after
this
expedition
comes
in
chronological
order
that
of
gustavus
adolphus
to
germany
the
army
contained
only
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
thousand
men
the
fleet
was
quite
large
and
was
manned
by
nine
thousand
sailors
ancillon
must
however
be
mistaken
in
stating
that
it
carried
eight
thousand
cannon
the
debarkation
in
pomerania
received
little
opposition
from
the
imperial
troops
and
the
king
of
sweden
had
a
strong
party
among
the
german
people
his
successor
was
the
leader
of
a
very
extraordinary
expedition
which
is
resembled
by
only
one
other
example
mentioned
in
history
i
refer
to
the
march
of
charles
of
sweden
across
the
belt
upon
the
ice
with
a
view
of
moving
from
sleswick
upon
copenhagen
by
way
of
the
island
of
funen
he
had
thousand
men
of
whom
nine
thousand
were
cavalry
and
artillery
in
proportion
this
undertaking
was
so
much
the
more
rash
because
the
ice
was
unsafe
several
pieces
of
artillery
and
even
the
king
own
carriage
having
broken
through
and
been
lost
after
years
of
peace
the
war
between
venice
and
the
turks
recommenced
in
the
latter
transported
an
army
of
thousand
men
in
three
hundred
and
fifty
vessels
to
candia
and
gained
possession
of
the
important
post
of
canea
before
the
republic
thought
of
sending
succor
although
the
people
of
venice
began
to
lose
the
spirit
which
made
her
great
she
still
numbered
among
her
citizens
some
noble
souls
morosini
grimani
and
mocenigo
struggled
several
years
against
the
turks
who
derived
great
advantages
from
their
numerical
superiority
and
the
possession
of
canea
the
venetian
fleet
had
nevertheless
gained
a
marked
ascendency
under
the
orders
of
grimani
when
a
third
of
it
was
destroyed
by
a
frightful
tempest
in
which
the
admiral
himself
perished
in
the
siege
of
candia
began
jussuf
attacked
the
city
furiously
at
the
head
of
thirty
thousand
men
after
being
repulsed
in
two
assaults
he
was
encouraged
to
attempt
a
third
by
a
large
breach
being
made
the
turks
entered
the
place
mocenigo
rushed
to
meet
them
expecting
to
die
in
their
midst
a
brilliant
victory
was
the
reward
of
his
heroic
conduct
the
enemy
were
repulsed
and
the
ditches
filled
with
their
dead
bodies
venice
might
have
driven
off
the
turks
by
sending
twenty
thousand
men
to
candia
but
europe
rendered
her
but
feeble
support
and
she
had
already
called
into
active
service
all
the
men
fit
for
war
she
could
produce
the
siege
resumed
some
time
after
lasted
longer
than
that
of
troy
and
each
campaign
was
marked
by
fresh
attempts
on
the
part
of
the
turks
to
carry
succor
to
their
army
and
by
naval
victories
gained
by
the
venetians
the
latter
people
had
kept
up
with
the
advance
of
naval
tactics
in
europe
and
thus
were
plainly
superior
to
the
mussulmans
who
adhered
to
the
old
customs
and
were
made
to
pay
dearly
for
every
attempt
to
issue
from
the
dardanelles
three
persons
of
the
name
of
morosini
and
several
mocenigos
made
themselves
famous
in
this
protracted
struggle
finally
the
celebrated
coprougli
placed
by
his
merits
at
the
head
of
the
ottoman
ministry
resolved
to
take
the
personal
direction
of
this
war
which
had
lasted
so
long
he
accordingly
proceeded
to
the
island
where
transports
had
landed
fifty
thousand
men
at
whose
head
he
conducted
the
attack
in
a
vigorous
in
this
memorable
siege
the
turks
exhibited
more
skill
than
previously
their
artillery
of
very
heavy
caliber
was
well
served
and
for
the
first
time
they
made
use
of
trenches
which
were
the
invention
of
an
italian
engineer
the
venetians
on
their
side
greatly
improved
the
methods
of
defense
by
mines
never
had
there
been
seen
such
furious
zeal
exhibited
in
mutual
destruction
by
combats
mines
and
assaults
their
heroic
resistance
enabled
the
garrison
to
hold
out
during
winter
in
the
spring
venice
sent
reinforcements
and
the
duke
of
feuillade
brought
a
few
hundreds
of
french
volunteers
the
turks
had
also
received
strong
reinforcements
and
redoubled
their
efforts
the
siege
was
drawing
to
a
close
when
six
thousand
frenchmen
came
to
the
assistance
of
the
garrison
under
the
leadership
of
the
duke
of
beaufort
and
navailles
a
sortie
discouraged
these
presumptuous
young
men
and
navailles
disgusted
with
the
sufferings
endured
in
the
siege
assumed
the
responsibility
at
the
end
of
two
months
of
carrying
the
remnant
of
his
troops
back
to
france
morosini
having
then
but
three
thousand
exhausted
men
to
defend
a
place
which
was
open
on
all
sides
finally
consented
to
evacuate
it
and
a
truce
was
agreed
upon
which
led
to
a
formal
treaty
of
peace
candia
had
cost
the
turks
years
of
efforts
and
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
men
killed
in
eighteen
assaults
and
several
hundred
sorties
it
is
estimated
that
thousand
christians
of
different
nations
perished
in
the
glorious
defense
of
the
place
the
struggle
between
louis
holland
and
england
gives
examples
of
great
maritime
operations
but
no
remarkable
descents
that
of
james
ii
in
ireland
was
composed
of
only
six
thousand
frenchmen
although
de
tourville
fleet
contained
ships
of
the
line
carrying
five
thousand
eight
hundred
cannon
and
thousand
sailors
a
grave
fault
was
committed
in
not
throwing
at
least
twenty
thousand
men
into
ireland
with
such
means
as
were
disposable
two
years
later
de
tourville
had
been
conquered
in
the
famous
day
of

had
landed
were
enabled
to
return
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
treaty
which
required
their
evacuation
of
the
island
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
swedes
and
russians
undertook
two
expeditions
very
different
in
character
charles
wishing
to
aid
the
duke
of
holstein
made
a
descent
upon
denmark
at
the
head
of
twenty
thousand
men
transported
by
two
hundred
vessels
and
protected
by
a
strong
squadron
he
was
really
assisted
by
the
english
and
dutch
navies
but
the
expedition
was
not
for
that
reason
the
less
remarkable
in
the
details
of
the
disembarkation
the
same
prince
effected
a
descent
into
livonia
to
aid
narva
but
he
landed
his
troops
at
a
swedish
port
peter
the
great
having
some
cause
of
complaint
against
the
persians
and
wishing
to
take
advantage
of
their
dissensions
embarked
in
upon
the
volga
he
entered
the
caspian
sea
with
two
hundred
and
seventy
vessels
carrying
twenty
thousand
and
descended
to
agrakhan
at
the
mouths
of
the
koisou
where
he
expected
to
meet
his
cavalry
this
force
numbering
nine
thousand
dragoons
and
five
thousand
cossacks
joined
him
after
a
by
way
of
the
caucasus
the
czar
then
seized
derbent
besieged
bakou
and
finally
made
a
treaty
with
one
of
the
parties
whose
dissensions
at
that
time
filled
with
discord
the
empire
of
the
soofees
he
procured
the
cession
of
astrabad
the
key
of
the
caspian
sea
and
in
some
measure
of
the
whole
persian
empire
the
time
of
louis
xv
furnished
examples
of
none
but
secondary
expeditions
unless
we
except
that
of
richelieu
against
minorca
which
was
very
glorious
as
an
escalade
but
less
extraordinary
as
a
descent
in
an
english
fleet
sailed
from
portsmouth
this
was
joined
by
a
portion
of
the
squadron
from
martinico
the
whole
amounted
to
nineteen
ships
of
the
line
eighteen
smaller
vessels
of
war
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
transports
carrying
ten
thousand
men
the
expedition
besieged
and
captured
trs
the
spaniards
however
in
made
a
descent
with
fifteen
or
sixteen
thousand
men
upon
algiers
with
a
view
of
punishing
those
rovers
of
the
sea
for
their
bold
piracies
but
the
expedition
for
want
of
harmonious
action
between
the
squadron
and
the
was
unsuccessful
on
account
of
the
murderous
fire
which
the
troops
received
from
the
turkish
and
arab
musketeers
dispersed
among
the
undergrowth
surrounding
the
city
the
troops
returned
to
their
vessels
after
having
two
thousand
men
placed
de
the
american
war
was
the
epoch
of
the
greatest
maritime
efforts
upon
the
part
of
the
french
europe
was
astonished
to
see
this
power
send
count
to
america
with
ships
of
the
line
while
at
the
same
time
orvilliers
with
a
fleet
of
ships
of
the
line
was
to
cover
a
descent
to
be
effected
with
three
hundred
transports
and
forty
thousand
men
assembled
at
havre
and
malo
this
new
armada
moved
back
and
forth
for
several
months
but
accomplished
nothing
the
winds
finally
drove
it
back
to
port
was
more
fortunate
as
he
succeeded
in
getting
the
superiority
in
the
antilles
and
in
landing
in
the
united
states
six
thousand
frenchmen
under
rochambeau
who
were
followed
at
a
later
date
by
another
division
and
assisted
in
investing
the
english
army
under
cornwallis
at
yorktown
the
independence
of
america
was
thus
secured
france
would
perhaps
have
gained
a
triumph
over
her
implacable
rival
more
lasting
in
its
effects
had
she
in
addition
to
the
display
made
in
the
english
channel
sent
ten
ships
and
seven
or
eight
thousand
men
more
to
india
with
admiral
suffren
during
the
french
revolution
there
were
few
examples
of
descents
the
fire
at
toulon
emigration
and
the
battle
of
ushant
had
greatly
injured
the
french
navy
hoche
expedition
against
ireland
with
thousand
men
was
scattered
by
the
winds
and
no
further
attempts
in
that
quarter
were
made
at
a
later
date
bonaparte
expedition
to
egypt
consisting
of
thousand
men
thirteen
ships
seventeen
frigates
and
four
hundred
transports
obtained
great
successes
at
first
which
were
followed
by
sad
reverses
the
turks
in
hopes
of
expelling
him
landed
fifteen
thousand
men
at
aboukir
but
were
all
captured
or
driven
into
the
sea
notwithstanding
the
advantages
this
peninsula
gave
them
of
intrenching
themselves
and
waiting
for
reinforcements
this
is
an
excellent
example
for
imitation
by
the
party
on
the
defensive
under
similar
circumstances
the
expedition
of
considerable
magnitude
which
was
sent
out
in
to
domingo
was
remarkable
as
a
descent
but
failed
on
account
of
the
ravages
of
yellow
fever
since
their
success
against
louis
the
english
have
given
their
attention
more
to
the
destruction
of
rival
fleets
and
the
subjugation
of
colonies
than
to
great
descents
the
attempts
made
in
the
eighteenth
century
against
brest
and
cherbourg
with
bodies
of
ten
or
twelve
thousand
men
amounted
to
nothing
in
the
heart
of
a
powerful
state
like
france
the
remarkable
conquests
which
procured
them
their
indian
empire
occurred
in
succession
having
obtained
possession
of
calcutta
and
then
of
bengal
they
strengthened
themselves
gradually
by
the
arrival
of
troops
in
small
bodies
and
by
using
the
sepoys
whom
they
disciplined
to
the
number
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
the
expedition
to
holland
in
was
composed
of
forty
thousand
men
but
they
were
not
all
landed
at
once
the
study
of
the
details
of
the
operations
is
however
quite
interesting
in
abercrombie
after
threatening
ferrol
and
cadiz
effected
a
descent
into
egypt
with
twenty
thousand
englishmen
the
results
of
this
expedition
are
well
known
general
stuart
expedition
to
calabria
after
some
successes
at
maida
was
for
the
purpose
of
regaining
possession
of
sicily
that
against
buenos
ayres
was
more
unfortunate
in
its
results
and
was
terminated
by
a
capitulation
in
lord
cathcart
attacked
copenhagen
with
thousand
men
besieged
and
bombarded
the
city
and
gained
possession
of
the
danish
fleet
which
was
his
object
in
wellington
appeared
in
portugal
with
fifteen
thousand
men
after
gaining
the
victory
of
vimeira
and
assisted
by
the
general
rising
of
the
portuguese
he
forced
junot
to
evacuate
the
kingdom
the
same
army
increased
in
numbers
to
thousand
and
placed
under
moore
command
while
making
an
effort
to
penetrate
into
spain
with
a
view
of
relieving
madrid
was
forced
to
retreat
to
corunna
and
there
after
suffering
severe
losses
wellington
having
effected
another
landing
in
portugal
with
reinforcements
collected
an
army
of
thirty
thousand
englishmen
and
as
many
portuguese
with
which
he
avenged
moore
misfortunes
by
surprising
soult
at
oporto
may
and
then
beating
joseph
at
talavera
under
the
very
gates
of
his
capital
the
expedition
to
antwerp
in
the
same
year
was
one
of
the
largest
england
has
undertaken
since
the
time
of
henry
it
was
composed
of
not
less
than
seventy
thousand
men
in
all
forty
thousand
and
thirty
thousand
sailors
it
did
not
succeed
on
account
of
the
incapacity
of
the
leader
a
descent
entirely
similar
in
character
to
that
of
charles
of
sweden
was
effected
by
thirty
russian
battalions
passing
the
gulf
of
bothnia
on
the
ice
in
five
columns
with
their
artillery
their
object
was
to
take
possession
of
the
islands
of
aland
and
spread
a
feeling
of
apprehension
to
the
very
gates
of
stockholm
another
division
passed
the
gulf
to
umeå
march
general
murray
succeeded
in
effecting
a
descent
in
the
neighborhood
of
tarragona
in
with
the
intention
of
cutting
suchet
off
from
valencia
however
after
some
successful
operations
he
thought
best
to
the
expedition
set
on
foot
by
england
against
napoleon
after
his
return
from
elba
in
was
remarkable
on
account
of
the
great
mass
of
landed
at
ostend
and
antwerp
the
army
contained
sixty
thousand
men
but
some
came
by
land
and
others
were
disembarked
at
a
friendly
port
the
english
engaged
in
an
undertaking
in
the
same
year
which
may
be
regarded
as
very
extraordinary
i
refer
to
the
attack
on
the
capital
of
the
united
states
the
world
was
astonished
to
see
a
handful
of
seven
or
eight
thousand
englishmen
making
their
appearance
in
the
midst
of
a
state
embracing
ten
millions
of
people
taking
possession
of
its
capital
and
destroying
all
the
public
buildings
results
unparalleled
in
history
we
would
be
tempted
to
despise
the
republican
and
unmilitary
spirit
of
the
inhabitants
of
those
states
if
the
same
militia
had
not
risen
like
those
of
greece
rome
and
switzerland
to
defend
their
homes
against
still
more
powerful
attacks
and
if
in
the
same
year
an
english
expedition
more
extensive
than
the
other
had
not
been
entirely
defeated
by
the
militia
of
louisiana
and
other
states
under
the
orders
of
general
jackson
if
the
somewhat
fabulous
numbers
engaged
in
the
irruption
of
xerxes
and
the
crusades
be
excepted
no
undertaking
of
this
kind
which
has
been
actually
carried
out
especially
since
fleets
have
been
armed
with
powerful
artillery
can
at
all
be
compared
with
the
gigantic
project
and
proportionate
preparations
made
by
napoleon
for
throwing
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
veterans
upon
the
shores
of
england
by
the
use
of
three
thousand
launches
or
large
protected
by
sixty
ships
of
the
line
from
the
preceding
narrative
the
reader
will
perceive
what
a
difference
there
is
in
point
of
difficulty
and
probability
of
success
between
descents
attempted
across
a
narrow
arm
of
the
sea
a
few
miles
only
in
width
and
those
in
which
the
troops
and
are
to
be
transported
long
distances
over
the
open
sea
this
fact
gives
the
reason
why
so
many
operations
of
this
kind
have
been
executed
by
way
of
the
bosporus
the
following
paragraphs
have
been
compiled
from
authentic
data
in
the
french
government
sent
an

the
resistance
was
slight
in
the

to
be
made
upon

with
an
army
of
thirteen
thousand

and
the
castle
of

speedily
fell
into
the
possession
of
the

this
important
post
became
the
secondary
base
of

the
naval
commanders
wished
to
attack
the
defenses
of
bomarsund
on
one
of
the
aland
isles
but
after
a
reconnoissance
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
french

to
add
similar
facts
for
the
english

landed
on
the

whence
they
marched
to

this
expedition
is
remarkable
for
the
smallness
of
the
numbers
which
ventured
at
such
a
great
distance
from

and
succor
to

the
french

small
in
numbers
and
presented
no
remarkable
features
toward
the
close
of
the

spain
are
now
january
engaged
in
an
expedition
directed
against
mexico
the
first
operations
were
the
capture
by
the
spanish
forces
of
vera
cruz
and
its
defenses
the
mexicans
offered
no
resistance
at
that
point
the
future
will
develop
the
plans
of
the
allies
but
the
ultimate
result
of
a
struggle
if
indeed
one
be
attempted
by
the
mexicans
can
not
be
doubted
when
three
of
the
most
powerful
states
of
europe
are
arrayed
against
the
feeble
