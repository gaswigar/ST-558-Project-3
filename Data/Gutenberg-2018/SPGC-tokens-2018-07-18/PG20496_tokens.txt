o
the
pride
of
the
german
heart
is
this
noble
river
and
right
it
is
for
of
all
the
rivers
of
this
beautiful
earth
there
is
none
so
beautiful
as
this
longfellow
prefatory
note
last
year
i
made
the
journey
between
mainz
and
bonn
on
one
of
our
splendid
rhine
steamers
our
vessel
glided
along
like
a
great
on
the
shore
rose
mountains
castles
and
ruins
and
over
all
the
sun
shined
brightly
from
a
blue
august
sky
it
was
twelve
years
since
i
had
visited
the
scenes
of
my
youth
and
every
rhinelander
will
understand
with
what
pleasure
i
saw
again
those
smiling
landscapes
arrayed
in
their
summer
beauty
wandering
back
to
my
i
soon
became
absorbed
in
the
panorama
then
the
sound
of
a
melodious
female
voice
speaking
english
fell
on
my
ears
i
looked
around
a
girl
was
bending
over
a
book
and
entertaining
her
father
and
mother
by
reading
something
of
special
interest
and
beauty
i
listened
and
recognised
some
of
my
own
sentences
rendered
into
the
speech
of
shakespeare
these
three
were
learning
to
feel
the
charms
of
the
lorelei
legend
as
i
had
felt
it
i
confess
my
pulse
beat
quicker
as
i
heard
my
poor
endeavours
highly
praised
and
i
could
not
refrain
from
advancing
and
thanking
the
young
reader
for
her
kindly
appreciation
of
my
endeavours
she
seemed
delighted
when
she
discovered
that
i
was
the
author
and
rose
to
greet
me
in
the
most
amiable
manner
i
complimented
the
travellers
that
during
the
past
century
the
rhine
had
become
the
home
of
romance
for
the
english
speaking
nations
the
same
as
italy
for
the
germans
the
girl
smiled
and
remarked
that
i
must
pay
that
compliment
to
her
mother
in
particular
as
she
was
by
birth
an
englishwoman
but
the
head
of
the
family
hastened
to
add
that
among
americans
whom
he
might
speak
for
the
enthusiasm
for
the
beauties
of
the
rhine
was
not
less
than
among
their
cousins
these
two
nations
which
are
bound
by
so
many
ties
to
each
other
and
also
to
ourselves
were
thus
represented
before
me
the
people
undoubtedly
form
by
far
the
largest
contingent
of
our
rhine
travellers
and
it
was
pleasant
indeed
to
receive
so
fine
a
testimonial
to
the
beauties
of
my
birth
place
we
had
a
most
interesting
conversation
and
i
was
not
a
little
moved
as
i
observed
that
these
foreigners
who
had
travelled
over
half
the
world
and
had
seen
the
grandeur
of
switzerland
and
the
charms
of
italy
should
have
such
an
unaffected
admiration
for
our
grand
old
river
i
am
rather
sorry
for
those
who
neglect
the
rhine
lohengrin
and
siegfried
immortalised
by
the
great
master
of
bayreuth
also
heroic
figures
in
your
rhine
legends
remarked
the
young
enthusiastically
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seriously
thought
of
this
i
was
indeed
touched
and
my
thoughts
travelled
back
to
the
days
of
long
long
ago
when
as
a
little
chap
in
my
native
bonn
i
had
first
listened
with
interest
to
the
charming
voices
of
the
daughters
of
old
albion
who
came
in
large
numbers
to
reside
in
the
famous
as
i
separated
from
my
friends
at
the
foot
of
the
drachenfels
i
gave
them
a
small
present
to
keep
as
a

near
the

of
the
rhine
au
pays
du
rhin
in
the
region
where
the
rhine
has
its
source
there
towered
in
ancient
times
a
green
alp
this
alp
belonged
to
an
honest
peasant
and
along
with
a
neat
little
house
in
the
valley
below
formed
his
only
possession
the
man
died
suddenly
and
was
deeply
mourned
by
his
wife
and
child
some
days
after
an
unexpected
visitor
was
announced
to
the
widow
he
was
a
man
who
had
much
pastureland
up
in
that
region
but
for
a
long
time
his
one
desire
had
been
to
possess
the
alp
of
his
neighbour
now
deceased
as
by
it
his
property
would
be
rounded
off
to
his
satisfaction
quickly
making
his
resolution
he
declared
to
the
dismayed
woman
that
the
alp
belonged
to
him
her
husband
had
secretly
pledged
it
to
him
in
return
for
a
loan
after
the
bad
harvest
of
the
previous
year
when
the
widow
angrily
accused
him
of
being
a
liar
the
man
produced
a
promissory
note
spread
it
out
and
with
a
hard
laugh
showed
her
his
statement
was
confirmed
in
black
and
white
the
distressed
woman
burst
into
tears
and
declared
it
was
impossible
that
her
late
husband
should
have
made
a
secret
transaction
of
such
a
nature
the
alp
was
the
sole
inheritance
of
their
son
and
never
would
she
willingly
surrender
it
i
will
pay
you
compensation
for
the
renunciation
of
your
claim
although
nothing
obliges
me
to
do
so
declared
the
visitor
with
apparent
compassion
in
the
meantime
producing
his
purse
the
weeping
woman
motioned
to
him
to
put
back
his
gold
and
told
him
to
go
which
he
did
three
days
later
the
widow
was
summoned
before
the
judge
there
the
neighbour
produced
his
document
and
repeated
his
demand
for
the
possession
of
the
disputed
alp
the
judge
who
had
been
shamefully
bribed
declared
the
document
valid
and
awarded
the
alp
to
the
pursuer
the
widow
staggered
home
the
new
possessor
of
the
alp
on
the
other
hand
hastened
up
to
the
mountains
at
full
gallop
the
man
could
no
longer
master
his
impatience
to
see
for
the
first
time
as
his
legally
recognised
property
the
pastureland
he
had
acquired
by
deceit
there
for
three
days
a
storm
had
raged
uninterruptedly
as
quickly
as
the
soaked
ways
would
permit
he
ascended
to
the
high
country
having
arrived
he
stared
around
with
horrified
eyes
and
fell
in
a
swoon
to
the
earth
overcome
with
consternation
upon
the
soft
green
alp
an
unseen
hand
had
rolled
a
mountain
of
ice
of
the
possession
which
the
unjust
judge
had
assigned
to
him
nothing
was
now
to
be
seen
his
own
pastures
too
which
adjoined
were
covered
with
snow
and
ice
whilst
the
meadows
of
the
other
alpsmen
below
lay
spread
out
in
the
morning
light
like
a
velvet
carpet
towards
noon
a
broken
man
rode
home
into
the
valley
cursing
himself
and
the
wicked
magistrate
who
had
consented
to
such
an
evil
transaction
the
people
there
however
said
to
each
other
the
fronfasten

the
little
mother
of

passed
over
our
valley
last
night
with
her
train
of
maidens
over
the
house
of
that
greedy
rich
man
the
ghostly
company
stopped
and
by
that
it
is
fixed
which
one
must
die
in
the
course
of
the
year
and
so
it
happened
up
there
where
the
youthful
rhine
rushes
down
through
deep
rocky
chasms
the
petrified
alp
stands
to
this
day
a
silent
warning
from
days

the
last
hohenrätier
illustration
der
letzte
hohenrätier
nach
dem
gemälde
von
stückelberg
the
domleschg
valley
was
formerly
the
scene
of
bitter
feuds
and
is
mentioned
in
the
struggle
for
freedom
by
the
swiss
peasants
of
the
ancient
bund
some
five
hundred
years
ago
there
stood
the
castle
of
the
hohenrätier
the
last
descendant
of
the
degenerate
race
on
the
high
realt
was
rightly
feared
in
the
whole
district
he
was
the
terror
of
the
peaceful
inhabitants
of
the
district
and
harried
not
only
them
but
also
merchants
and
pilgrims
who
passed
along
the
highway
below
the
wrath
against
this
unchivalrous
wickedness
increased
mightily
one
day
this
man
perpetrated
a
daring
deed
of
violence
whilst
on
an
excursion
into
the
valley
he
had
discovered
a
charming
maid
who
sought
berries
in
a
lonely
wood
in
his
wicked
eagerness
he
dragged
the
maiden
on
to
his
horse
and
fled
amusing
himself
with
her
lamentations
he
carried
his
booty
up
the
steep
castle
hill
a
poacher
had
observed
the
occurrence
and
alarmed
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
they
carried
the
intelligence
without
delay
into
the
domleschg
the
oppressed
people
around
then
rose
and
joining
together
approached
the
castle
that
very
night
having
felled
giant
trees
they
threw
a
bridge
over
the
moat
cast
firebrands
into
the
interior
and
stormed
into
the
through
gaps
in
the
gates
and
walls
then
the
baron
appeared
mounted
on
his
driven
out
of
his
abode
by
tongues
of
flame
before
him
he
held
the
captured
maiden
and
in
the
light
of
the
conflagration
his
naked
sword
glittered
in
his
right
hand
dealing
mighty
blows
on
both
sides
he
forced
his
horse
forward
the
eyes
of
which
had
been
bound
intending
to
make
a
way
down
the
hill
but
the
living
wall
of
peasants
was
impenetrable
quickly
making
his
resolution
the
knight
rushed
to
the
side
where
the
wall
of
rock
fell
some
seven
hundred
feet
sheer
into
the
youthful
rhine
the
foaming
steed
stood
trembling
in
front
of
the
yawning
abyss
the
shout
of
the
multitude
echoed
into
the
night
thousands
of
arms
were
instantly
stretched
towards
the
river
and
one
of
them
at
the
last
moment
succeeded
in
snatching
his
prey
from
the
robber
just
as
the
steed
tortured
and
bleeding
from
sword
and
spur
hurled
itself
with
a
mighty
spring
into
the
depths
below
so
ended
the
last
of
the
hohenrätiers
in
the
dawn
only
the
smoking
ruins
of
the
proud
castle
remained
and
the
morning
bells
announced
to
the
peasants
that
their
long
desired
freedom
had
been
won
these
ruins
are
situated
on
the
hinter
rhine
above
thusis
and
it
is
said
that
the
last
hohenrätier
like
many
others
of
the
former
tyrants
of
the
rätigau
yearly
on
john
eve
when
this
event
occurred
may
be
seen
riding
round
the
fallen
walls
of
his
castle
clad
in
black
armour
which
emits
glowing
sparks
bodensee
the
island
of
mainau
for
many
hundreds
of
years
the
names
of
the
masters
of
bodmann
have
been
very
closely
connected
with
the
island
in
the
lake
of
boden
at
first
the
island
was
in
the
possession
of
this
noble
race
but
later
on
in
the
thirteenth
century
it
passed
into
the
hands
of
an
order
of
german
knights
a
legend
relates
the
story
to
us
of
how
this
change
came
to
pass
about
this
time
the
whole
of
this
magnificent
property
was
held
in
possession
by
a
youthful
maiden
who
had
inherited
this
beautiful
island
with
all
its
many
charms
as
may
be
supposed
the
wooers
for
the
lovely
maiden
hand
and
inheritance
became
very
numerous
she
however
had
made
her
own
choice
and
it
had
fallen
upon
a
nobleman
from
langenstein
every
evening
when
the
sun
was
sinking
down
into
the
golden
waters
this
maiden
walked
along
the
strand
watching
and
listening
for
some
sound
then
the
measured
splash
of
an
oar
would
be
heard
approaching
in
the
twilight
and
a
little
boat
would
be
drawn
up
on
the
shore
a
youthful
boatman
would
spring
joyfully
forth
and
lovingly
greet
the
maiden
there
this
pair
of
lovers
wove
dreams
about
the
time
from
which
only
a
short
period
now
separated
them
when
they
should
belong
openly
to
each
other
before
the
world
the
nobleman
landed
one
evening
as
usual
but
this
time
his
heart
was
depressed
and
sorrowful
he
informed
his
betrothed
mournfully
that
his
father
who
was
then
suffering
agony
from
gout
had
once
taken
a
vow
to
god
and
to
the
emperor
that
he
would
go
on
a
crusade
to
the
holy
land
but
being
unable
to
fulfil
his
oath
he
laid
it
to
his
charge
to
carry
it
out
as
he
meant
to
have
done
the
maiden
wept
bitterly
on
hearing
these
unexpected
tidings
trust
me
and
the
powers
on
high
i
shall
not
make
this
great
sacrifice
in
vain
said
her
lover
consolingly
i
shall
return
that
i
feel
confident
of
thus
with
bright
hopes
in
his
heart
the
youthful
crusader
bade
his
weeping
betrothed
and
every
evening
when
the
sun
was
sinking
into
the
golden
waters
the
maiden
walked
along
the
strand
looking
with
longing
eyes
out
into
the
misty
distance
spring
came
and
disappeared
summer
followed
and
the
swallows
fled
from
the
lake
to
warmer
climes
the
maiden
sending
many
a
warm
greeting
with
them
wintry
storms
blew
over
the
waters
whistling
round
the
lonely
island
and
the
maiden
had
become
as
pale
as
the
flakes
of
snow
which
fell
against
the
news
one
day
reached
the
castle
that
the
crusaders
had
returned
from
the
east
but
that
the
nobleman
from
langenstein
was
languishing
in
a
turkish
prison
in
a
remote
castle
belonging
to
the
sultan
the
maiden
was
by
these
tidings
and
now
spent
her
days
in
prayers
and
tears
within
the
mighty
walls
of
a
gloomy
castle
in
the
east
a
young
hero
was
sitting
pining
over
his
bitter
fate
he
prayed
and
groaned
aloud
in
his
grief
thinking
of
his
betrothed
from
whom
he
had
been
so
cruelly
separated
the
sultan
had
offered
the
youth
his
favourite
daughter
a
seductive
eastern
beauty
but
the
prisoner
had
turned
scornfully
away
her
dark
glancing
eyes
having
no
charm
for
him
that
night
the
youth
had
a
strange
dream
an
angel
was
soaring
over
his
couch
and
came
down
to
his
side
and
a
voice
whispered
promise
yourself
to
me
and
you
will
see
your
native
land
again
the
knight
started
up
and
said
reverently
that
was
the
voice
of
god
confused
thoughts
rushed
through
his
soul
he
must
renounce
his
love
but
at
least
he
would
see
her
again
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
he
promised
with
a
fervent
oath
that
he
would
dedicate
himself
to
the
lord
if
he
might
only
see
the
beloved
maiden
once
more
an
earthquake
shook
the
castle
to
its
very
foundations
unfastening
the
prison
doors
thus
setting
the
prisoner
at
liberty
in
a
marvellous
way
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
coast
without
being
caught
by
the
guards
of
the
sultan
and
a
vessel
sailing
to
venice
took
him
on
board
but
as
he
approached
his
native
land
the
struggle
in
his
soul
between
love
and
duty
was
very
great
at
one
moment
it
seemed
to
overcome
him
and
he
felt
he
could
no
longer
keep
his
vow
but
god
again
admonished
him
reaching
the
lake
he
steered
his
boat
towards
the
island
but
a
sudden
storm
arose
threatening
him
with
a
watery
grave
he
prayed
fervently
to
heaven
again
swearing
his
oath
the
storm
subsided
and
the
little
boat
having
missed
its
course
landed
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
where
the
grand
master
of
an
order
of
german
knights
had
his
seat
the
tired
approached
begging
to
be
received
a
boon
kindly
granted
to
him
then
starting
off
again
with
his
boat
the
youth
reached
the
island
he
there
imprinted
a
sorrowful
kiss
on
his
beloved
pure
white
forehead
bidding
her
and
the
world
for
ever
the
young
girl
resigned
herself
at
first
silently
to
her
fate
but
she
soon
resolved
on
another
plan
this
place
which
had
once
been
such
a
happy
home
had
no
longer
any
charms
to
offer
her
and
she
therefore
presented
the
island
of
mainau
to
the
german
order
of
knights
on
one
condition
that
the
nobleman
from
langenstein
should
be
the
successor
of
the
grand
master
this
request
was
willingly
granted
the
noble
maiden
gave
up
all
her
rich
possession
and
left
the
island
in
the
bodensee
it
is
said
that
she
retired
to
a
convent
but
no
one
ever
knew
where
the
chronicle
informs
us
that
hugh
of
langenstein
became
one
of
the
most
capable
grand
masters
of
this
order
of
knights
of

basle
one
hour
in
advance
basle
was
once
surrounded
by
enemies
and
very
hard
pressed
on
all
sides
a
troop
of
discontented
citizens
made
a
shameful
compact
with
the
besiegers
to
help
them
to
conquer
the
town
it
was
arranged
one
dark
night
that
exactly
as
the
clock
was
striking
twelve
the
attack
was
to
be
made
from
within
and
without
the
traitors
were
all
ready
waiting
for
midnight
in
great
excitement
having
no
evil
presentiments
of
what
was
about
to
happen
the
expected
hour
approached
accidentally
the
watchman
of
the
tower
heard
of
the
proposed
attack
and
no
time
being
left
to
warn
the
commander
of
the
garrison
or
the
guard
he
quickly
and
with
great
presence
of
mind
determined
upon
a
safe
expedient
he
put
forward
the
hand
of
the
great
clock
one
hour
so
that
instead
of
striking
midnight
the
clock
struck
one
the
traitors
in
the
town
looked
at
each
other
aghast
believing
the
enemies
outside
had
neglected
or
perhaps
betrayed
them
general
doubt
and
misunderstanding
reigned
in
both
camps
while
they
were
debating
what
plan
they
must
now
adopt
the
watchman
had
time
to
communicate
with
the
magistrate
and
with
the
governor
of
the
town
the
alarm
was
raised
the
citizens
warned
and
the
treacherous
plan
completely
wrecked
the
enemy
at
last
tired
of
the
useless
siege
retired
discouraged
the
magistrate
in
remembrance
of
this
remarkable
deed
ordered
that
the
should
remain
in
advance
as
the
courageous
watchman
had
set
it
that
eventful
night
this
singular
regulation
continued
till
the
year
and
although
the
honest
inhabitants
of
basle
were
as
talkative
tongues
asserted
a
century
in
everything
else
yet
with
regard
to

a
race
of
giants
is
said
to
have
lived
in

castle
niedeck
in
the
valley
of
the
breusch
was
their
residence
but
even
the
ruins
of
this
fortress
have
long
since
disappeared
the
legend
however
remains
to
tell
us
that
they
were
a
peaceable
people
well
disposed
to
mankind
the
daughter
of
the
master
of
the
castle
was
one
day
leisurely
walking
through
the
adjoining
wood
on
approaching
the
fields
and
meadows
of
the
valley
she
perceived
a
peasant
ploughing
the
young
giantess
looked
in
great
astonishment
at
the
tiny
man
who
seemed
to
be
so
busily
engaged
trudging
along
after
his
little
team
and
turning
up
the
ground
with
his
small
iron
instrument
she
had
never
before
seen
anything
so
wonderful
and
was
very
much
amused
at
the
sight
it
seemed
to
her
a
nice
little
toy
and
she
clapped
her
hands
in
childish
glee
so
that
the
echo
sounded
among
the
mountains
then
picking
up
man
horse
and
plough
she
placed
them
in
her
apron
and
hurried
back
gaily
to
the
castle
there
she
showed
her
father
the
nice
little
toy
greatly
pleased
at
what
she
had
found
the
giant
however
shook
his
enormous
head
gravely
and
said
in
a
displeased
tone
do
you
know
child
who
this
trembling
little
creature
with
his
struggling
tiny
animal
is
that
you
have
chosen
for
a
plaything

he
who
scoffs
at
or
maltreats
him
will
be
punished

take
the
little
labourer
therefore
back
to
the
place
he
came
from
the
young
giantess
greatly
ashamed
and
deeply
blushing
with
embarrassment
put
the
amusing
little
toy
back
into
her
apron
and
carried
it
obediently
down

the

clock
the
cathedral
was
finished
and
the
city
magistrates
resolved
to
place
an
ingenious
clock
on
the
upper
tower
for
a
long
time
they
searched
in
vain
but
at
last
a
master
was
found
who
offered
to
create
a
work
of
art
such
as
had
never
been
seen
in
any
land
the
members
of
the
council
were
highly
satisfied
with
this
proposal
and
the
master
began
his
work
weeks
and
months
passed
and
when
at
last
it
was
finished
there
was
general
astonishment
the
clock
was
indeed
so
wonderful
that
nothing
to
match
it
could
be
found
in
the
whole
country
it
marked
not
only
the
hours
but
the
days
and
months
as
well
a
globe
was
attached
to
it
which
also
marked
out
the
rising
and
the
setting
of
the
sun
and
the
eclipses
of
that
body
and
the
moon
could
be
seen
at
the
same
time
as
they
took
place
in
nature
every
change
was
pointed
out
by
wand
and
every
constellation
appeared
at
the
right
time
shortly
before
the
stroke
of
the
clock
a
figure
representing
death
emerged
from
the
centre
and
sounded
the
full
hour
while
at
the
quarter
and
half
hours
the
statue
of
christ
came
forth
repelling
the
destroyer
of
all
life
added
to
all
these
wonders
was
a
beautiful
chime
that
played
melodious
hymns
such
was
the
marvellous
clock
in
the
cathedral
of
strassburg
the
magistrates
however
proved
themselves
unworthy
of
their
new
possession
pride
and
presumption
got
the
better
of
them
making
them
commit
a
most
unjust
and
ungrateful
action
they
desired
their
town
to
be
the
only
one
in
the
land
which
possessed
such
a
work
of
art
and
in
order
to
prevent
the
maker
from
making
another
like
it
they
did
not
shrink
from
the
vilest
of
crimes
taking
advantage
of
the
rumour
that
such
a
wonderful
work
could
only
have
been
made
by
the
aid
of
witchcraft
they
accused
the
of
being
united
with
the
devil
threw
him
into
prison
and
cruelly
condemned
him
to
be
blinded
the
unhappy
artist
resigned
himself
to
his
bitter
fate
without
a
murmur
the
only
favour
he
asked
was
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
examine
the
clock
once
again
before
the
judgment
was
carried
out
he
said
he
wanted
to
arrange
something
in
the
works
which
no
one
else
could
understand
the
crafty
magistrates
being
anxious
to
have
the
clock
perfect
granted
him
this
request
the
artist
filed
sawed
regulated
here
and
there
and
then
was
led
away
and
in
the
same
hour
deprived
of
his
sight
the
cruel
deed
was
hardly
accomplished
when
it
was
found
that
the
clock
had
stopped
the
artist
had
destroyed
his
work
with
his
own
hands
his
righteous
determination
that
the
chimes
would
never
ring
again
had
become
a
melancholy
truth
up
to
the
present
no
one
has
been
able
again
to
set
the
dead
works
going
an
equally
splendid
clock
now
adorns
the
cathedral
but
the
remains
of
the
first
one
have
been
preserved
ever
since
the
little
man
at
the
angel
pillar
close
to
the
famous
clock
in
the
cathedral
of
strassburg
there
is
a
little
man
in
stone
gazing
up
at
the
angel
pillar
which
supports
the
south
wing
of
the
cathedral
long
ago
the
little
man
who
is
now
sculptured
in
stone
stood
there
in
flesh
and
blood
he
used
to
stare
up
at
the
pillar
with
a
criticising
eye
from
top
to
bottom
and
again
from
bottom
to
top
then
he
would
shake
his
head
doubtfully
each
time
it
happened
once
that
a
sculptor
passed
the
cathedral
and
saw
the
little
man
looking
up
evidently
comparing
the
proportions
of
the
pillar
it
seems
to
me
you
are
finding
fault
with
the
pillar
my
good
fellow
the
remarked
and
the
little
man
nodded
with
a
look
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
speak
out
my
man
said
the
master
tapping
the
fellow
shoulder
encouragingly
the
pillar
is
certainly
splendid
began
the
latter
slowly
the
apostles
the
angels
and
the
saviour
are
most
beautiful
too
but
there
is
one
thing
troubling
me
that
slender
pillar
can
not
support
that
heavy
vault
much
longer
it
will
soon
totter
and
fall
down
and
all
will
go
to
pieces
the
sculptor
looked
alternately
at
the
work
of
art
and
at
its
strange
a
contemptuous
smile
passed
over
his
features
you
are
quite
convinced
of
the
truth
of
your
statement
are
you
asked
he
enquiringly
the
bold
critic
repeated
his
doubts
with
an
important
air
well
cried
the
with
comical
earnestness
then
you
will
remain
there
always
gazing
at
the
pillar
until
it
sinks
down
crushed
by
the
vault
he
went
straight
off
into
his
workshop
seized
hammer
and
chisel
and
formed
the
little
man
into
stone
just
as
he
was
looking
upwards
with
a
knowing
face
and
an
important
air
this
little
figure
is
still
there
at
the
present
day
with
both
hands
leaning
on
the
balustrade
of
nicholas
chapel
awaiting
the
expected
fall
of
the
pillar
and
most
likely
he
will
remain
there
for
many
a
century

down
this
legend
in

thus
preserving

precious
relic

a
powerful
story
it

of

corresponding
to
the

just
as
the
primitive
mind
of
a
people
loves
to
represent
it
the
story
begins
as
a
lovely
idyll

ends
in

tragedy
the

seat

secretly
drawn
towards
the

and
in
brunhild
heart
the
bridal
happiness
of
chriemhild
awakens
such
envy
that
soon
no
friendly
word
passes
between
the
women
they
become
estranged
and
one
day
her
bad
feeling
leads
brunhild
to
harsh
words
then

chriemhild
gave
unbridled
licence
to
her
tongue
in

rash
insolence
she
represents
to

night

stabbed

from

was
to
spread

report
that

been
slain
by
robbers
whilst
hunting
alone
so
on
the
following
day
they
crossed
the

to
worms
in
the
night
hagen
caused
the
dead
body
of
siegfried
to
be
laid
in

chamber
in
the
early
morning
as
chriemhild
accompanied
by
her
attendants
was
preparing
to
go
to
mass
in
the
cathedral
she
noticed
the
corpse
of
her
hero
a
wail
of
sorrow
arose
chriemhild
threw
herself
weeping
on
the
body
of
her
murdered
husband
alas
she
cried
thy
shield
is
not
hewn
by
swords
thou
hast
been
foully
murdered
did
i
but
know
who
has
done
this
i
would
avenge
thy
death
chriemhild
ordered
a
magnificent
bier
for
her
royal
hero
and
demanded
that
an
ordeal
should
be
held
over
the
corpse
for
it
is
a
marvellous
thing
and
to
this
day
it
happens
that
when
the
bloodstained
murderer
approaches
wounds
bleed
anew
so
all
the
princes
and
nobles
of
burgundy
walked
past
the
dead
body
above
which
was
the
figure
of
the
crucified
redeemer
of
the
world
and
lo
when
the
grim
hagen
came
forward
the
wounds
of
the
dead
man
began
to
flow
in
the
presence
of
the
astounded
men
and
horrified
women
chriemhild
accused
hagen
of
the
assassination
of
her
husband
much
treachery
and
woe
accompanied
the
expiation
of
this
great
crime
the
nibelungen
hoard
the
cause
of
the
shameful
deed
was
sunk
in
the
middle
of
the
rhine
in
order
to
prevent
future
strife
arising
from
human
greed
but
chriemhild
undying
sorrow
was
not
mitigated
nor
her
unconquerable
thirst
for
revenge
appeased
after
the
burial
of
his
son
king
siegmund
begged
in
vain
that
chriemhild
should
come
to
the
royal
city
of
xanten
she
remained
at
worms
for
thirteen
years
constantly
near
her
beloved
dead
then
the
sorrowing
woman
removed
to
the
abbey
of
lorch
which
her
mother
frau
ute
had
founded
thither
also
she
transferred
siegfried
body
when
etzel
attila
the
ruler
of
the
huns
wooed
her
chriemhild
urged
not
by
love
but
by
very
different
feelings
gave
him
her
hand
and
accompanied
her
heathen
lord
to
the
ungarland
then
she
treacherously
invited
siegfried
murderers
to
visit
her
husband
and
prepared
for
them
a
destruction
which
fills
the
mind
with
horror
the
burgundian
king
and
his
followers
who
since
the
hoard
had
come
into
their
possession
were
called
the
nibelungen
fell
slaughtered
in
the
etzelburg
under
the
swords
of
the
huns
and
their
allies
thus
atoning
for
their
faithlessness
to
the
hero
siegfried

with
this
awful
holocaust

eldest
son
conrad
openly
rebelled
against
him
and
treated
his
father
most
scornfully
when
this
prince
died
suddenly
the
second
son
henry
attempted
the
deposition
of
his
father
and
made
intrigues
against
him
thus
forced
to
abdicate
his
throne
the
emperor
fled
to
liège
accompanied
by
one
faithful
servant
kurt
and
there
lay
down
to
his
last
rest
his
body
was
left
for
five
years
in
unconsecrated
ground
in
a
foreign
country
kurt
remained
faithful
and
prayed
incessantly
at
the
of
his
royal
master
at
last
the
pope
at
henry
request
consented
to
recall
the
ban
henry
ordered
his
father
remains
to
be
brought
to
speyer
and
solemnly
interred
with
the
royal
family
kurt
was
allowed
to
follow
the
procession
to
speyer
but
wearied
out
by
this
long
watching
the
old
man
died
a
few
days
afterwards
just
at
the
moment
of
his
death
the
bells
in
the
cathedral
at
speyer
tolled
without
any
human
hand
putting
them
in
motion
as
they
always
did
when
an
imperial
death
took
place
years
passed
the
german
emperor
henry
lay
dying
on
his
luxurious
couch
at
speyer
his
bodily
sufferings
were
intense
but
the
agony
of
his
mind
was
even
greater
he
had
obtained
the
crown
which
now
pressed
so
heavily
on
his
head
by
shameful
treacherous
means
the
apparition
of
his
father
dying
in
misery
appeared
to
him
and
no
words
of
the
flatterers
at
his
could
still
the
voice
of
his
conscience
at
last
death
freed
him
from
all
his
torments
and
at
the
same
hour
the
bells
which
were
always
rung
when
a
poor
sinner
was
led
to
execution
tolled
set
in
motion
by
no
human
hand
thus
were
the
bells
the
instrument
of
that
hand
which
wisely
and
warningly
wrote
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother

the
emperor
was
to
be
crowned
at
frankfort
and
great
festivities
were
to
be
given
in
the
town
in
his
honour
among
them
a
masquerade
at
which
knights
and
noble
ladies
rivalled
each
other
in
splendour
joy
was
depicted
on
every
face
at
this
great
assembly
only
one
knight
among
the
many
guests
being
noticeable
for
his
gravity
and
restraint
he
wore
black
armour
and
the
feather
waving
above
his
visor
was
black
too
no
one
knew
him
or
could
guess
who
he
was
he
approached
the
empress
with
a
noble
grace
bent
his
knee
and
asked
her
to
dance
with
him
which
she
graciously
consented
to
do
he
glided
gracefully
through
the
splendid
halls
with
the
queen
of
the
festival
and
soon
every
eye
was
turned
on
them
and
everyone
was
eager
to
know
who
he
was
the
empress
was
charmed
with
her
excellent
partner
and
the
grace
of
his
refined
conversation
pleased
her
so
much
that
she
granted
him
a
second
and
a
third
dance
everyone
became
more
and
more
curious
to
know
who
this
masked
knight
was
meanwhile
the
hour
struck
when
every
mask
had
to
be
raised
and
every
masked
guest
must
make
himself
known
more
than
all
the
others
the
empress
was
anxious
to
know
who
her
partner
was
but
he
hesitated
and
even
refused
to
take
off
his
mask
until
she
ordered
him
peremptorily
to
do
so
the
knight
obeyed
but
none
of
the
high
ladies
or
noble
knights
recognised
him
suddenly
two
stewards
pressed
through
the
crowd
crying
out
with
indignation
and
horror
it
is
the
headsman
from
bergen
then
the
emperor
in
great
wrath
ordered
the
shameful
offender
who
had
thus
degraded
the
empress
and
insulted
his
sovereign
to
be
led
to
execution
but
the
culprit
throwing
himself
at
the
emperor
feet
said
boldly
i
have
transgressed
my
lord
and
offended
you
and
your
noble
guests
but
most
heavily
have
i
sinned
against
my
queen
no
punishment
not
even
blood
will
be
able
to
wash
out
the
disgrace
you
have
suffered
through
me
therefore
oh
king
allow
me
to
propose
a
remedy
to
efface
the
shame
draw
your
sword
and
knight
me
and
i
will
throw
down
my
gauntlet
to
any
one
who
dares
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
my
sovereign
the
emperor
was
taken
by
surprise
at
this
bold
proposal
however
it
appeared
the
wisest
plan
to
adopt
you
are
a
knave
he
replied
after
a
moment
consideration
but
your
advice
is
good
and
displays
prudence
just
as
your
offence
shows
adventurous
courage
well
then
laying
his
sword
on
the
neck
rise
sir
knight
you
have
acted
like
a
knave
and
the
knave
of
bergen
you
shall
be
called
henceforth
a
joyful
shout
of
approbation
pealed
through
the
halls
and
the
new
knight
again
glided
gracefully
through
the
crowd
with
the
queen
of
the
festival

the
priest
or
as
some
say
canon
in
the
old
town
of
mayence
was
a
very
worthy
man
and
at
the
same
time
a
singer
besides
devoting
himself
to
science
he
composed
numerous
pious
verses
which
he
dedicated
to
the
holy
virgin
he
also
played
the
harp
and
wrote
many
beautiful
songs
in
honour
of
the
female
sex
in
contrast
to
many
contemporary
poets
he
considered
woman
a
higher
title
than
wife
which
only
signifies
a
married
woman
so
on
account
of
the
chivalry
displayed
in
his
numberless
poems
and
songs
posterity
gave
him
the
name
of
frauenlob
under
which
title
he
is
better
known
than
under
his
own
name
of
heinrich
of
meissen
the
love
and
veneration
which
thankful
women
paid
him
was
very
great
not
only
during
his
but
even
more
so
after
his
death
their
grief
was
intense
when
it
became
known
that
the
poet
voice
would
never
more
be
heard
in
this
world
it
was
agreed
to
honour
him
with
such
a
burial
as
no
poet
had
ever
before
received
the
funeral
procession
moved
slowly
and
sorrowfully
along
the
streets
the
greater
part
of
the
cortege
being
women
in
deep
mourning
who
prayed
for
the
repose
of
the
poet
soul
eight
of
the
most
beautiful
among
them
carried
the
coffin
which
was
covered
with
flowers
at
the
grave
songs
of
lamentation
were
heard
from
women
gentle
voices
precious
which
had
been
the
poet
favourite
drink
and
which
so
often
had
inspired
his
poetry
was
poured
by
hands
of
his
admirers
over
his
grave
so
profusely
the
legend
relates
that
the
entrance
of
the
church
was
flooded
by
the
libation
but
still
more
precious
than
all
these
gifts
were
the
tears
which
on
this
memorable
day
were
shed
by
many
a
gentle
lady
the
wanderer
can
still
see
the
monument
erected
to
this
great
benefactor
in
the
cathedral
at
mayence
which
represents
the
figure
of
a
beautiful
woman
in
marble
placing
a
wreath
on
the
coffin
of
the
great
singer
who
had
honoured
women
in
the
most
chivalrous
of
songs
bishop

in

in
the
year
there
was
a
very
pious
priest
in
mayence
called
bishop
willigis
he
was
only
the
son
of
a
poor
wheelwright
but
by
his
perseverance
and
his
own
merit
he
had
attained
to
the
dignity
of
first
priest
of
the
kingdom
the
honest
citizens
of
mayence
loved
and
honoured
the
worthy
divine
although
they
did
not
altogether
like
having
to
bow
down
to
one
who
had
been
brought
up
in
a
simple
cottage
like
themselves
the
bishop
once
reproved
them
in
gentle
tones
for
thinking
too
much
of
mere
descent
this
vexed
the
supercilious
citizens
and
one
night
they
determined
to
play
willigis
a
trick
they
took
some
chalk
and
drew
enormous
wheels
on
all
the
doors
of
his
house
early
next
morning
as
the
bishop
was
going
to
mass
he
noticed
the
scoffers
malicious
work
he
stood
silently
looking
at
the
wheels
the
chaplain
by
his
side
expecting
every
moment
that
the
reverend
prelate
would
burst
forth
in
a
terrible
rage
but
a
gay
smile
spread
over
the
bishop
features
and
ordering
a
painter
to
be
sent
to
him
he
told
him
to
paint
white
wheels
on
a
scarlet
visible
to
every
eye
just
where
the
chalk
wheels
had
been
drawn
and
underneath
to
paint
the
words
willigis
willigis
just
think
what
you
have
risen
from
but
he
did
not
stop
there
he
ordered
the
wheelwright
to
make
him
a
and
caused
it
to
be
placed
over
his
couch
in
memory
of
his
extraction
thereafter
the
scoffers
were
put
to
silence
and
the
people
of
mayence
began
to
honour
and
esteem
their
worthy
bishop
who
though
he
had
been
so
exalted
possessed
such
honest
white
wheels
on
a
red
ground
have
been
the
arms
of
the
bishops
of
mayence
ever
since
johannisberg
wherever
the
german
tongue
is
heard
and
even
further
still
the
king
of
all
rhine
wines
johannisberger
is
known
and
sought
after
every
friend
of
the
grape
which
grows
on
the
banks
of
this
river
is
well
acquainted
with
it
but
few
perhaps
know
of
its
princely
origin
it
is
princely
not
because
princes
hands
once
kept
the
key
to
johannisberg
but
rather
because
princely
hands
planted
the
vine
in
the
rhine
country
and
this
royal
giver
was
no
other
than
charlemagne
the
ruler
of
the
kingdom
of
the
franks
once
in
early
spring
charles
the
great
was
standing
on
the
balcony
of
his
castle
at
ingelheim
his
eyes
straying
over
the
beautiful
stretch
of
country
at
his
feet
snow
had
fallen
during
the
night
and
the
hills
of
rüdesheim
were
clothed
in
white
as
the
imperial
ruler
was
looking
thoughtfully
over
the
landscape
he
noticed
that
the
snow
on
one
side
of
johannisberg
melted
quicker
in
the
sun
rays
than
on
any
other
part
charles
who
was
a
great
and
deep
thinker
began
to
reflect
that
on
a
spot
where
the
rays
of
the
sun
shone
so
genially
something
better
than
grass
would
thrive
sending
for
kunrat
his
faithful
servant
he
bade
him
saddle
his
horse
the
next
day
at
dawn
and
ride
to
orleans
a
town
famous
for
its
good
wine
he
was
to
inform
the
citizens
that
the
emperor
had
not
forgotten
the
excellent
wine
they
had
given
him
there
and
that
he
would
like
to
grow
the
same
vines
on
the
rhine
he
desired
the
citizens
of
orleans
therefore
to
send
him
plants
from
their
country
the
messenger
set
off
to
do
the
king
bidding
and
ere
the
moon
had
again
gone
round
her
course
was
back
in
the
castle
at
ingelheim
great
satisfaction
prevailed
at
court
charles
mighty
ruler
as
he
was
even
went
so
far
as
to
cross
to
rüdesheim
where
he
planted
with
his
royal
hand
the
french
vine
in
german
soil
this
was
no
mere
passing
whim
on
the
part
of
the
emperor
he
sent
messengers
constantly
to
bring
word
how
the
vines
were
thriving
in
rüdesheim
and
on
the
flanks
of
johannisberg
and
when
the
third
autumn
had
come
round
the
emperor
charlemagne
set
out
from
his
favourite
resort
for
the
rhine
country
and
great
rejoicing
prevailed
among
the
from
rüdesheim
to
johannisberg
the
first
cup
of
wine
was
solemnly
offered
to
the
emperor
a
golden
wine
in
a
golden
goblet
a
wine
worthy
of
a
king
charles
took
a
long
deep
draught
and
with
brightened
eyes
praised
the
delicious
drink
it
became
his
favourite
wine
this
fiery
johannisberger
making
him
young
again
in
his
old
age
what
charlemagne
then
felt
when
he
drank
this
wine
every
one
who
raises
the
sparkling
grapejuice
to
his
lips
is
keenly
sensible
of
also
wherever
the
german
tongue
is
heard
and
even
further
still
the
king
of
all
rhine
wines
is
known
and
sought
after
johannisberger
wine
the
legend
weaves
another
wonderful
tale
about
the
great
emperor
blessing
his
grapes
a
poet
pen
has
fashioned
it
into
a
song
which
is
still
often
heard
among
the
grapegatherers
every
spring
when
the
vines
are
blossoming
on
the
hills
and
in
the
valleys
along
the
river
and
their
fragrance
scents
the
air
a
tall
shadow
wanders
about
the
vineyards
at
night
a
purple
mantle
hanging
from
his
stately
shoulders
and
a
crown
on
his
head
it
is
charlemagne
the
great
emperor
who
planted
the
grapes
long
years
before
the
luscious
scent
of
the
blossoms
wakens
him
up
from
his
tomb
in
and
he
comes
to
bless
the
grapes
when
the
full
moon
gently
casts
her
bright
beams
on
the
water
lighting
up
the
emperor
nightly
path
he
may
be
seen
crossing
the
golden
bridge
formed
by
her
rays
and
then
wandering
further
along
the
hills
blessing
the
vines
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
at
the
first
crow
of
the
cock
he
returns
to
his
grave
in
and
sleeps
till
the
scent
of
the
grapes
wakens
him
next
spring
when
he
again
wanders
through
the
countries
along
the
rhine
blessing
the
vineyards
let
us
now
relate
another
little
story
which
is
told
of
the
monks
who
lived
at
johannisberg
once
the
high
abbot
of
fulda
came
unexpectedly
to
visit
the
cloister
at
johannisberg
just
about
the
time
when
the
grapes
were
ripe
the
worthy
abbot
made
many
inquiries
about
his
people
showed
himself
highly
pleased
with
the
works
of
the
industrious
monks
and
as
a
mark
of
his
continued
favour
invited
all
the
inmates
of
the
cloister
to
a
wine
maketh
the
heart
glad
thus
quoting
king
david
significant
words
the
holy
man
began
his
speech
god
loving
hand
will
be
gracious
in
future
years
to
your
vines
let
us
profit
by
his
grace
brothers
and
drink
what
he
has
provided
for
us
in
moderation
and
reverence
but
before
we
refresh
ourselves
with
god
good
gifts
take
your
breviaries
and
let
us
begin
with
a
short
prayer
breviaries
was
whispered
along
the
rows
and
the
eyes
of
the
fat
genial
faces
blinked
in
helpless
embarrassment
yes
your
breviaries
and
the
abbot
looked
silently
but
sternly
at
the
brothers
they
searched
and
searched
gradually
the
frown
disappeared
from
the
abbot
face
and
a
smile
gradually
spread
over
his
withered
features
well
never
mind
let
us
drink
said
he
then
feeling
his
pockets
he
said
with
a
gleam
in
his
eye
that
too
bad
i
ought
to
have
brought
a
corkscrew
with
me
when
i
came
to
the
rhine
a
corkscrew
every
one
dives
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
as
many
corkscrews
were
produced
before
the
worthy
abbot
as
there
were
brothers
present
then
a
gleam
of
merriment
beamed
in
the
abbot
eyes
bravo
ye
pious
monks
what
a
plentiful
supply
of
corkscrews
do
not
all
look
so
embarrassed
we
shall
not
be
annoyed
about
it
but
now
we
shall
sing
with
king
david
maketh
the
heart
glad
and
the
uncorked
bottle
went
the
rounds
ingelheim
eginhard
and
emma
i
the
story
which
we
have
now
to
relate
is
a
very
touching
one
and
it
becomes
even
more
interesting
when
we
know
that
it
is
based
on
real
fact
in
the
little
town
of
ingelheim
there
was
a
beautiful
marble
castle
the
favourite
residence
of
charlemagne
he
often
retired
to
this
lonely
peaceful
spot
accompanied
only
by
a
few
of
his
faithful
vassals
and
the
members
of
his
own
family
eginhard
the
private
secretary
was
never
missing
from
this
little
circle
charlemagne
thought
highly
of
this
man
then
in
the
prime
of
youth
on
account
of
his
profound
knowledge
and
extraordinary
talents
the
young
scholar
so
different
from
the
wise
councillors
not
only
in
his
learning
but
in
his
cultivated
manners
was
a
great
favourite
among
the
ladies
of
the
court
eginhard
who
was
a
constant
companion
of
the
emperor
had
also
become
an
intimate
member
of
the
family
circle
and
charlemagne
entrusted
him
with
the
education
of
his
favourite
child
emma
daughter
of
his
wife
gismonda
this
maiden
was
considered
the
most
beautiful
of
her
age
and
the
young
scholar
could
not
long
remain
cold
and
indifferent
to
her
charms
the
undisturbed
hours
which
should
have
been
spent
in
learning
led
to
a
mutual
understanding
eginhard
struggled
to
remind
himself
of
his
duty
towards
his
sovereign
but
love
overcame
him
and
soon
an
oath
of
eternal
fidelity
united
these
young
hearts
ii
the
great
emperor
ought
to
have
known
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
allowing
the
young
scholar
to
enjoy
the
society
of
his
passionate
daughter
in
the
still
hours
of
the
night
when
all
the
inmates
of
the
castle
lay
wrapped
in
sleep
eginhard
sought
the
chamber
of
his
beloved
she
listened
enchanted
to
the
glowing
words
of
his
burning
heart
but
their
love
was
chaste
and
pure
no
gusts
of
passion
troubling
them
but
fate
was
against
these
lovers
one
night
they
were
sitting
in
emma
chamber
talking
confidentially
together
the
great
palace
was
veiled
in
darkness
no
ray
of
light
no
star
was
to
be
seen
in
the
heavens
as
eginhard
was
about
to
leave
the
chamber
he
perceived
that
the
courtyard
below
was
covered
with
snow
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
pass
across
it
without
leaving
a
trace
behind
him
but
at
all
risks
he
must
reach
his
room
what
was
to
be
done
love
is
ingenious
after
considering
for
some
time
together
they
both
concluded
that
there
was
but
one
way
to
prevent
their
being
betrayed
the
slender
maiden
took
her
lover
on
her
back
and
carried
him
across
the
courtyard
thus
leaving
behind
only
her
two
small
it
happened
that
charles
the
great
had
not
yet
sought
the
repose
he
needed
so
much
as
care
banished
sleep
from
his
eyes
he
sat
at
his
window
and
looked
out
into
the
silent
night
in
the
courtyard
below
he
perceived
a
shadow
crossing
the
pavement
and
looking
carefully
he
recognised
his
favourite
daughter
emma
carrying
a
man
on
her
yes
and
this
man
was
eginhard
his
great
favourite
pain
and
anger
struggled
in
his
heart
he
wanted
to
rush
down
and
kill
him
an
emperor
daughter
and
a
mere
secretary
but
with
a
great
effort
he
restrained
himself
mastered
the
violent
agitation
which
this
unexpected
sight
caused
him
and
went
back
to
his
chamber
to
wait
wearily
for
dawn
iii
the
next
day
charles
assembled
his
councillors
they
were
all
horrified
to
see
his
ghastly
look
his
brow
was
dark
and
sorrow
was
depicted
on
every
feature
eginhard
looked
at
his
master
apprehending
coming
evil
charlemagne
stood
up
and
spake
what
does
a
royal
princess
deserve
who
receives
the
visit
of
a
man
at
night
the
councillors
looked
at
each
other
speechless
countenance
became
white
as
death
the
councillors
soon
guessed
the
name
of
the
royal
princess
and
they
consulted
together
for
some
time
not
knowing
what
to
say
but
at
last
one
councillor
answered
your
majesty
we
think
that
a
weak
woman
must
not
be
punished
for
anything
done
out
of
love
and
what
does
a
favourite
of
the
emperor
deserve
who
creeps
into
a
royal
princess
chamber
at
night
charlemagne
cast
a
dark
look
at
his
secretary
who
trembled
and
became
even
paler
alas
all
is
lost
murmured
he
to
himself
then
raising
his
voice
he
said
death
my
master
and
emperor
charles
looked
at
the
young
man
full
of
astonishment
the
wrath
in
his
soul
melted
at
this
and
fervent
repentance
deep
silence
followed
this
answer
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
emperor
dismissed
his
councillors
making
a
sign
at
the
same
time
to
eginhard
to
follow
him
without
a
word
charles
led
him
into
his
private
chamber
where
in
answer
to
his
summons
emma
appeared
her
heart
misgave
her
as
she
saw
the
dark
look
on
her
father
face
and
the
troubled
features
of
her
beloved
she
understood
all
at
once
and
with
a
convulsive
cry
of
pain
threw
herself
at
her
father
feet
mercy
mercy
my
father
we
love
each
other
so
dearly
murmured
she
raising
her
large
eyes
imploringly
mercy
murmured
eginhard
too
bending
his
knees
the
emperor
remained
silent
after
a
time
he
began
to
speak
earnestly
and
coldly
at
first
but
his
voice
changed
to
a
milder
tone
on
hearing
the
sobs
of
his
favourite
child
i
shall
not
separate
you
who
are
bound
to
each
other
by
love
a
priest
shall
unite
you
and
at
dawn
you
must
both
be
gone
from
the
castle
never
to
return
he
left
them
shutting
the
door
behind
him
the
beautiful
maiden
sank
down
on
her
knees
only
half
conscious
in
her
grief
of
what
her
father
had
said
but
eginhard
soft
voice
soon
whispered
in
her
ear
do
not
weep
emma
by
thrusting
you
from
him
your
father
my
master
has
only
bound
us
together
for
ever
come
he
continued
in
a
trembling
voice
alarmed
at
her
passionate
tears
we
must
go
but
love
will
be
ever
with
us
the
next
day
two
pilgrims
left
the
castle
of
ingelheim
and
took
the
road
in
the
direction
of
mayence
iv
time
wore
on
charles
the
great
had
made
war
on
saxony
had
set
the
roman
crown
upon
his
own
head
and
had
become
famous
throughout
the
whole
world
but
all
his
fame
had
not
prevented
his
hair
from
becoming
grey
nor
his
heart
from
being
sad
a
mournful
picture
had
imprinted
itself
on
his
mind
despite
all
his
efforts
to
forget
the
past
in
the
evening
when
the
setting
sun
glittered
on
the
marble
pillars
of
the
royal
palace
casting
its
golden
rays
into
the
chamber
of
the
great
emperor
it
would
find
him
sitting
motionless
in
his
carved
his
grey
head
buried
in
his
hands
mournful
dreams
troubling
his
peace
he
was
thinking
of
the
days
which
were
past
of
the
young
man
whose
gentle
ways
made
him
so
different
from
the
rough
warriors
of
the
court
how
he
used
to
recite
poetry
and
sing
the
songs
of
the
old
bards
so
passionately
and
the
old
legends
which
the
emperor
prized
so
much
how
he
used
to
read
to
him
from
the
old
gray
parchment
which
he
eginhard
had
written
so
carefully
how
his
own
favourite
daughter
had
so
often
been
present
sitting
at
his
feet
listening
intently
to
the
reader
all
this
came
back
to
his
memory
saddening
his
heart
and
filling
his
eyes
with
tears
sounded
through
the
forest
charles
and
his
followers
were
at
the
chase
the
old
emperor
seeking
to
forget
his
grief
had
seized
his
spear
and
had
gone
out
to
hunt
in
his
eagerness
to
follow
a
magnificent
stag
he
had
become
separated
from
his
escort
the
sun
was
already
low
in
the
west
the
animal
now
seeing
no
way
of
escape
as
his
pursuer
was
close
behind
him
dashed
into
a
river
and
swam
to
the
other
side
the
emperor
in
hot
pursuit
and
much
exhausted
arrived
at
the
water
edge
and
for
the
first
time
noticed
that
he
was
alone
and
in
a
part
of
the
country
quite
unknown
to
him
the
river
lay
before
him
and
the
forest
behind
but
the
latter
seemed
to
be
quite
impenetrable
it
was
already
night
and
charles
sought
in
vain
to
find
some
path
or
track
as
he
was
looking
round
him
he
perceived
a
light
in
the
distance
greatly
pleased
he
started
off
in
that
direction
and
found
a
little
hut
close
to
the
river
but
on
looking
through
the
window
charlemagne
saw
the
room
was
a
very
poor
one
perhaps
this
is
the
hermitage
of
some
pious
man
thought
he
and
knocked
at
the
door
whereupon
a
man
appeared
on
the
threshold
without
mentioning
his
name
the
emperor
informed
him
of
what
had
happened
and
begged
shelter
for
the
night
at
the
sound
of
this
loved
voice
the
man
trembled
but
controlling
himself
he
invited
the
emperor
to
enter
a
young
woman
was
sitting
on
a
stool
rocking
a
baby
in
her
arms
she
started
became
very
pale
at
the
sight
of
the
emperor
and
then
hurried
into
the
next
room
to
hide
her
emotion
charles
sat
down
and
refusing
refreshment
from
his
host
leaned
his
head
wearily
on
his
hands
minutes
passed
and
still
he
sat
there
lost
in
thought
dreaming
of
those
happy
days
at
last
the
sweet
prattle
of
a
child
roused
him
and
looking
up
he
saw
a
little
girl
about
five
years
old
at
his
side
stretching
out
her
arms
to
him
bidding
him
charles
looked
closely
at
the
little
creature
his
heart
throbbing
within
him
what
is
your
name
little
one
asked
he
emma
answered
the
child
emma
repeated
charles
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
drawing
the
child
closer
to
him
he
pressed
a
kiss
on
its
forehead
in
a
moment
the
man
and
his
young
wife
were
at
the
emperor
feet
imploring
pardon
emma
eginhard
cried
he
with
great
emotion
embracing
them
both
blessed
be
the
place
where
i
have
found
you
again
emma
and
eginhard
returned
in
great
pomp
to
the
emperor
court
the
latter
gave
them
his
beautiful
palace
at
ingelheim
and
only
felt
himself
happy
when
he
was
with
them
he
caused
a
cloister
to
be
built
on
the
spot
where
he
had
found
them
again
which
to
the
present
day
is
called
seligenstadt
town
of
the
happy
in
the
church
belonging
to
this
little
town
the
tomb
of
eginhard
and
emma
is
still
shown
for
according
to
their
wishes
their
bones
were
interred
in
the
same
coffin
rüdesheim
the
brömserburg
in
the
lofty
cathedral
of
spires
stood
a
great
assemblage
of
knights
and
on
the
throne
near
the
altar
sat
conrad
der
staufe
with
his
hands
resting
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
all
were
listening
intently
to
the
burning
words
of
bernard
of
clairvaux
who
was
describing
the
ruthless
manner
in
which
the
holy
places
of
palestine
had
been
laid
waste
as
the
saintly
preacher
ended
with
a
thrilling
appeal
to
the
religious
feelings
of
his
audience
a
great
shout
on
to
jerusalem
rang
through
the
sacred
edifice
most
of
the
knights
offered
to
bring
as
many
followers
as
possible
to
aid
their
pious
emperor
among
those
present
was
hans
brömser
the
lord
of
the
niederburg
at
rüdesheim
this
noble
knight
the
last
of
his
race
was
not
detained
at
home
by
family
cares
his
wife
had
early
been
taken
from
him
by
death
and
mechtildis
the
only
offspring
of
their
marriage
was
left
under
the
protection
of
the
neighbouring
falkenstein
family
so
the
pious
warriors
marched
by
devious
and
dangerous
routes
to
that
land
where
our
lord
lived
and
suffered
in
fierce
battle
with
the
saracens
many
a
noble
knight
closed
his
eyes
forever
many
met
a
harder
fate
a
living
death
in
the
noisome
prisons
of
the
unbelievers
after
a
lost
battle
sir
brömser
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
turks
and
in
a
dungeon
had
to
suffer
shameful
imprisonment
sometimes
they
would
force
their
knightly
foe
to
turn
a
millstone
while
the
crowd
jeered
then
in
the
hour
of
deepest
misery
the
knight
made
a
vow
to
god
give
me
my
freedom
again
and
i
vow
that
my
child
mechtildis
shall
devote
her
life
to
the
church
and
he
repeated
the
solemn
words
again
and
yet
a
third
time
then
happened
what
none
of
his
had
ever
hoped
for
the
brave
crusaders
stormed
this
turkish
stronghold
in
the
syrian
desert
and
liberated
their
from
captivity
full
of
gratitude
to
god
hans
brömser
again
fought
valiantly
in
the
holy
cause
meanwhile
at
home
in
the
hospitable
keep
above
the
rhine
a
maiden
awaited
with
anxiety
the
return
of
her
father
often
in
the
silent
hours
with
sweetness
and
sunshine
around
her
without
and
within
she
stood
on
the
and
she
saw
in
reverie
that
blue
eastern
land
whilst
she
listened
to
the
wild
throbbing
of
her
young
heart
in
which
the
blossoms
of
first
love
were
bursting
then
one
night
her
father
returned
to
the
rhineland
in
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
mechtildis
embraced
her
father
long
and
silently
beside
the
maiden
now
in
her
seventeenth
year
stood
the
young
lord
of
falkenstein
the
youth
bowed
deeply
to
the
lord
of
the
brömserburg
and
greeted
him
kindly
with
the
words
welcome
home
father
then
the
vow
made
in
the
syrian
prison
rose
like
a
spectre
to
pall
the
joy
of
the
crusader
return
in
the
of
the
castle
a
large
company
had
assembled
to
celebrate
the
happy
return
of
hans
brömser
and
his
faithful
companions
the
praise
of
the
crusaders
resounded
and
many
stories
were
told
of
the
dangers
the
heroes
had
encountered
with
stirring
words
the
knight
related
to
his
listening
guests
how
he
himself
had
fought
in
the
sacred
cause
and
how
he
had
suffered
imprisonment
among
the
heathen
then
in
a
lower
tone
and
with
solemn
words
he
told
his
friends
of
the
vow
he
had
made
in
his
hour
of
deep
despair
in
the
syrian
dungeon
the
painful
silence
which
followed
was
broken
by
a
stifled
cry
and
the
knight
daughter
pale
as
the
covering
on
the
festive
board
sank
unconscious
to
the
floor
with
burning
cheek
and
flashing
eye
the
young
lord
of
falkenstein
rose
and
with
a
firm
voice
exclaimed
mechtildis
belongs
to
me
she
has
solemnly
given
herself
to
me
forever
the
murmur
soon
subsided
before
the
stern
countenance
of
the
lord
of
the
castle
mechtildis
has
been
dedicated
to
heaven
not
to
you
boy
the
last
of
the
brömser
race
has
sworn
it
and
abides
by
it
the
knight
said
this
with
suppressed
fury
and
soon
his
guests
departed
in
silence
mechtildis
lay
in
her
chamber
in
wild
grief
the
flickering
lamp
beside
the
crucifix
threw
an
unsteady
light
on
the
extended
form
of
the
maiden
who
was
measuring
the
tedious
night
hours
in
the
of
her
young
heart
to
the
distracted
maid
her
chamber
seemed
to
be
transformed
to
an
oppressive
dungeon
seizing
the
lamp
with
a
trembling
hand
she
hurried
up
the
narrow
winding
stair
on
to
the
roof
of
the
castle
and
there
committed
her
great
grief
to
the
listening
ear
of
night
leaning
on
the
wall
she
looked
away
towards
the
castle
where
lived
the
noble
young
lord
to
whom
she
had
dedicated
her
life
i
am
thine
my
beloved
she
sobbed
no
star
was
visible
in
the
sky
a
wild
autumn
wind
shrieked
and
swirled
round
the
keep
in
accompaniment
to
the
storm
in
the
maiden
breast
a
short
piercing
cry
echoed
in
the
darkness
was
it
the
bride
of
the
winds
or
a
human
cry
the
night
swallowed
it
from
the
parapet
of
the
brömserburg
a
female
form
had
been
hurled
down
into
the
dark
floods
of
the
rhine
below
a
bright
harvest
morning
followed
a
stormy
night
in
the
brömserburg
they
were
searching
everywhere
in
vain
for
their
lord
daughter
soon
however
a
mournful
procession
approached
bearing
the
mortal
remains
of
mechtildis
in
the
early
dawn
a
young
woman
had
rescued
the
body
from
the
waters
of
the
river
now
the
walls
of
the
brömserburg
echoed
with
sounds
of
woe
over
the
early
death
of
this
last
fair
young
flower
of
the
brömser
race
hans
brömser
threw
himself
on
the
body
and
buried
his
stern
features
in
the
snowy
linen
not
a
tear
bedewed
his
eyelids
as
a
propitiatory
offering
for
the
rest
of
the
soul
of
the
maiden
who
had
thus
avoided
the
monastic
life
the
knight
in
his
deep
sorrow
vowed
to
build
a
chapel
on
the
hill
opposite
his
castle
then
hans
brömser
shut
himself
up
in
his
chamber
and
passed
the
following
days
in
silent
grief
while
the
grave
closed
over
his
wretched
child
many
months
passed
but
still
not
a
stone
of
the
promised
chapel
had
been
set
up
in
the
bitterness
of
his
sorrow
the
father
had
separated
himself
more
and
more
from
the
world
and
now
brooded
in
gloomy
isolation
one
day
a
servant
came
before
him
with
a
likeness
of
the
mother
of
god
which
an
ox
had
scraped
up
while
ploughing
a
field
on
the
hill
opposite
the
castle
and
three
times
the
servant
declared
he
had
heard
the
not
gottes
suffering
of
god
called
out
then
hans
brömser
remembered
his
vow
and
the
chapel
for
the
peace
of

this
day
bingen
the
below
bingen
in
the
middle
of
the
rhine
there
is
a
lonely
island
on
which
a
stronghold
is
to
be
seen
this
tower
is
called
the
for
many
centuries
a
very
gloomy
tale
has
been
told
about
it
in
connection
with
hatto
archbishop
of
mayence
whose
evil
deeds
were
throughout
the
country
hatto
is
said
to
have
been
ambitious
heartless
and
perfidious
as
well
as
cruel
towards
the
poor
he
extorted
taxes
from
his
people
tolls
were
imposed
and
new
burdens
invented
only
to
gratify
his
haughty
pride
and
his
love
of
display
on
a
little
island
between
bingen
and
rüdesheim
he
caused
a
tower
to
be
built
so
that
all
passing
ships
could
be
stopped
in
the
narrow
passage
where
they
were
obliged
to
pay
toll
soon
after
the
building
of
this
there
was
a
very
bad
harvest
in
the
country
round
mayence
drought
had
parched
the
fields
and
the
little
seed
remaining
had
been
destroyed
by
hail
the
scarcity
was
felt
all
the
more
because
the
bishop
had
bought
up
all
the
stores
of
corn
that
were
left
from
the
year
before
and
had
stored
them
up
safely
in
his
granaries
a
terrible
famine
now
threatened
the
land
spreading
misery
among
the
poor
the
unhappy
people
implored
the
cruel
bishop
to
lower
the
price
of
the
corn
in
his
which
he
wished
to
sell
at
such
exorbitant
prices
that
his
subjects
could
not
buy
it
all
their
petitions
were
in
vain
his
advisers
besought
him
to
have
pity
on
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
poor
but
hatto
remained
unmoved
when
cries
of
distress
and
the
murmuring
voices
of
the
exasperated
folk
were
raised
against
their
master
the
bishop
gave
free
vent
to
the
wicked
thoughts
of
his
soul
one
day
a
troop
of
hungry
beggars
came
crowding
to
the
episcopal
palace
crying
for
food
hatto
and
his
guests
were
just
sitting
down
to
a
luxurious
banquet
the
bishop
had
been
talking
to
his
companions
of
these
wretched
people
and
had
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
do
away
with
them
altogether
in
some
drastic
way
as
the
ragged
mob
of
men
women
and
children
with
hollow
cheeks
and
pale
faces
threw
themselves
at
his
feet
crying
for
bread
a
still
more
fiendish
plan
suggested
itself
beckoning
to
them
with
hypocritical
kindness
he
promised
them
corn
and
caused
them
to
be
led
outside
the
town
to
a
barn
where
each
one
was
to
receive
as
much
corn
as
he
wished
the
unhappy
folk
hurried
forth
their
hearts
full
of
gratitude
but
when
they
were
all
in
the
barn
hatto
ordered
the
doors
to
be
locked
and
the
barn
to
be
set
on
fire
the
screams
of
the
poor
wretches
were
and
could
be
heard
even
in
the
bishop
palace
but
cruel
hatto
called
out
scornfully
to
his
advisers
listen
how
the
mice
are
squeaking
among
the
corn
this
eternal
begging
is
at
an
end
at
last
may
the
mice
bite
me
if
it
is
not
true
but
the
punishment
which
heaven
sent
him
was
terrible
thousands
of
mice
came
out
of
the
burning
barn
made
their
way
to
the
palace
filled
every
chamber
and
corner
and
at
last
attacked
the
bishop
himself
his
servants
killed
them
by
hundreds
but
their
numbers
seemed
only
to
increase
as
did
their
ferocity
also
the
bishop
was
seized
with
horror
and
anticipating
god
punishment
he
fled
from
the
town
and
went
on
board
a
boat
hoping
to
defend
himself
from
his
terrible
pursuers
but
the
innumerable
horde
swam
in
legions
after
him
and
when
he
reached
his
tower
on
the
island
thinking
at
least
he
would
be
safe
there
the
mice
followed
him
gnawing
the
tower
and
tearing
for
themselves
an
entrance
with
their
sharp
teeth
till
at
last
they
reached
him
whom
they
sought
the
cruel
man
was
devoured
by
the
mice
which
attacked
him
by
scores
in
his
despair
he
offered
his
soul
to
the
evil
one
if
he
would
release
his
body
from
such
awful
agony
the
evil
spirit
came
freed
his
body
but
took
his
soul
away
for
himself
thus
runs
the
legend
history
however
speaks
less
severely
of
hatto
the
imperious
prelate
his
great
ambition
was
his
desire
of
power
he
was
the
founder
of
the
temporal
power
which
the
seat
of
mayence
obtained
and
which
later
on
made
it
the
first
bishopric
of
the
kingdom
but
he
was
always
hated
by
the
citizens
who
suffered
much
owing
to
his
proud
despotic
character
it
is
true
that
he
was
the
founder
of
the
toll
which
ships
in
olden
times
were
obliged
to
pay
on
the
rhine
so
that
this
fact
and
many
other
cruel
exactions
of
his
have
helped
to
evolve
the
terrible
legend
of
the
the
valley
of
the
nahe
kreuznach
a
mighty
draught
once
upon
a
time
in
the
high
castle
called
rheingrafenstein
near
kreuznach
the
flower
of
the
knights
belonging
to
the
rhine
country
were
assembled
they
were
powerful
warriors
these
nobles
of
ancient
rank
but
the
most
prominent
among
them
was
the
host
himself
the
proud
rhine
count
many
a
cup
had
he
already
emptied
to
the
health
of
his
distinguished
guests
and
rising
up
once
more
from
his
richly
carved
chair
he
cast
a
look
over
the
brilliant
assembly
and
said
in
a
boastful
tone
i
have
got
a
knight
high
boot
here
my
noble
lords
a
courier
left
it
behind
him
once
now
i
promise
on
the
honour
of
my
house
that
whoever
will
drink
it
empty
at
one
draught
to
him
i
will
give
the
village
of
hüffelsheim
yonder
the
count
smiling
at
the
novelty
of
the
challenge
took
the
boot
from
his
attendant
hand
caused
it
to
be
filled
to
the
brim
and
held
up
this
novel
cup
to
his
guests
tis
a
fair
challenge
come
on
whoever
will
dare
said
he
among
the
illustrious
company
present
there
was
one
john
of
sponheim
a
knight
in
the
country
for
his
enormous
drinking
powers
but
he
remained
unmoved
at
these
defiant
words
only
looking
inquiringly
at
his
neighbour
knight
weinhart
of
dhaun
who
in
great
perplexity
was
striving
to
hide
his
head
behind
a
large
goblet
old
flörsheimer
another
knight
whose
thirst
usually
seemed
unquenchable
stroked
his
gray
beard
doubtfully
while
kunz
of
stromberg
a
tall
thin
man
shook
his
head
at
the
thought
of
the
which
such
a
draught
would
bring
even
the
chaplain
of
the
castle
who
attributed
his
effective
intoning
of
to
the
virtues
of
the
rhenish
wine
which
he
indulged
in
so
freely
looked
longingly
at
the
boot
but
had
not
the
courage
to
attempt
such
a
rash
act
suddenly
a
knight
boos
of
waldeck
by
name
rose
he
was
a
muscular
man
with
the
strength
of
a
bear
in
a
voice
of
thunder
he
banged
his
mighty
fist
upon
the
table
and
said
scornfully
bring
me
that
little
boot
the
distinguished
company
stared
at
him
in
great
astonishment
but
boos
of
waldeck
taking
the
boot
in
his
sturdy
fist
cried
out
your
health
my
lords
then
flourishing
it
in
the
air
he
emptied
the
boot
at
one
draught
when
this
act
was
accomplished
boos
threw
himself
heavily
into
his
chair
and
addressing
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
said
with
a
humorous
twinkle
in
his
eye
did
the
courier
not
leave
the
other
boot
too
i
might
possibly
win
a
second
bet
and
thus
acquire
the
village
of
roxheim
into
the
bargain
the
count
looked
much
abashed
but
the
noble
guests
only
laughed
heartily
at
the
joke
thus
stout
boos
of
waldeck
became
lord
of
the
village
of
hüffelsheim
the
foundation
of
castle
sponheim
the
following
legend
tells
us
about
the
origin
of
castle
sponheim
in
the
valley
of
the
nahe
once
a
knight
of
ravensberg
was
eagerly
wooing
the
beautiful
young
countess
of
heimburg
but
there
was
a
serious
obstacle
in
his
path
to
success
some
years
before
a
ravensberg
had
killed
a
heimburg
in
a
quarrel
and
since
that
time
a
bitter
feud
had
divided
the
two
houses
the
brave
knight
felt
this
bitterly
but
in
spite
of
it
he
did
not
leave
off
his
wooing
the
young
countess
was
much
touched
by
his
constancy
and
one
day
she
spoke
thus
to
her
impetuous
suitor
my
lord
if
you
will
dare
to
go
to
the
holy
land
there
to
expiate
the
sins
of
your
fathers
and
bring
me
back
a
relic
from
the
sepulchre
of
our
redeemer
in
that
same
hour
your
suit
will
be
heard
the
knight
in
great
joy
kissed
the
maiden
slender
hand
and
departed
carrying
the
memory
of
her
sweet
smile
away
in
his
heart
just
at
this
time
the
call
of
the
emperor
barbarossa
now
an
old
man
sounded
throughout
the
land
and
the
knight
of
ravensberg
did
not
neglect
the
opportunity
but
hastened
forth
to
join
the
imperial
army
the
expedition
was
a
long
and
terrible
one
and
the
troops
wearily
made
their
way
across
the
desert
plains
of
palestine
the
knight
though
a
brave
man
had
no
special
love
for
warlike
adventures
and
during
these
exhausting
marches
he
thought
sorrowfully
of
his
quiet
castle
on
the
nahe
of
how
he
used
to
lie
down
there
in
peace
and
safety
at
night
without
being
in
fear
of
the
saracens
who
under
cover
of
darkness
would
break
in
waving
their
scimitars
in
air
an
event
which
was
a
nightly
occurrence
on
this
expedition
ravensberg
however
fought
bravely
in
many
a
battle
and
after
the
deaths
of
barbarossa
and
his
son
he
joined
the
army
of
richard
the
through
all
this
anxious
time
he
never
forgot
his
dear
one
at
home
and
his
longing
for
her
became
stronger
every
day
till
it
seemed
to
get
beyond
endurance
king
richard
was
called
back
to
england
on
some
urgent
and
the
knight
of
ravensberg
was
among
the
few
who
embarked
with
him
the
brave
knight
was
very
happy
and
while
the
king
ship
was
sailing
along
the
coast
of
greece
and
up
the
blue
adriatic
sea
he
would
often
stand
on
deck
and
weave
bright
dreams
of
the
future
sometimes
when
no
one
was
near
he
would
pull
out
a
little
black
ebony
box
set
with
precious
stones
on
which
a
woman
name
was
written
in
golden
letters
the
interior
was
beautifully
lined
with
costly
silk
and
a
small
splinter
of
wood
lay
within
which
the
knight
would
kiss
most
reverently
he
had
paid
a
large
sum
of
money
for
it
in
the
holy
land
where
he
had
bought
it
from
a
jewish
merchant
this
man
had
sworn
to
him
that
this
fragment
was
from
the
cross
to
which
the
son
of
god
had
been
nailed
the
knight
was
very
happy
during
this
long
homeward
journey
but
a
great
misfortune
awaited
him
just
as
the
crusaders
came
in
sight
of
italy
their
vessel
was
wrecked
the
king
of
england
the
knight
of
ravensberg
and
a
few
others
were
saved
with
great
difficulty
and
brought
to
land
but
our
poor
knight
was
inconsolable
he
had
held
the
precious
little
box
high
above
him
in
the
water
but
a
mighty
wave
had
torn
it
from
him
and
on
opening
his
eyes
he
found
himself
on
shore
the
holy
relic
had
saved
him
but
he
had
lost
his
treasure
and
now
all
hope
of
his
promised
happiness
was
gone
one
day
a
weary
and
dispirited
crusader
returned
to
the
castle
of
heimburg
he
announced
his
arrival
to
the
young
countess
most
humbly
but
she
her
lovely
face
lighted
up
by
a
bright
smile
hurried
to
meet
the
knight
whose
sunburnt
countenance
betokened
great
hardships
she
listened
silently
to
his
mournful
story
then
raising
her
beautiful
head
she
asked
was
not
the
little
box
set
with
precious
stones
and
was
not
my
name
in
golden
letters
on
it
yes
noble
lady
said
the
knight
the
bitterness
of
his
disappointment
newly
awakened
and
now
it
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
in
spite
of
my
fervent
prayers
to
george
to
save
the
precious
fragment
of
our
saviour
cross
the
countess
beckoned
to
a
page
and
after
a
few
minutes
the
boy
brought
her
on
a
velvet
cushion
a
little
black
ebony
box
set
with
precious
stones
with
a
woman
name
written
on
it
the
knight
uttered
a
cry
of
joyful
surprise
for
he
recognised
the
jewel
at
once
entreat
the
holy
patron
of
knighthood
to
pardon
you
said
the
countess
with
a
smile
a
strange
knight
brought
this
to
the
steward
a
few
days
ago
and
before
i
had
time
to
send
for
him
he
had
disappeared
it
was
george
himself
whispered
the
knight
crossing
himself
piously
which
proves
that
the
fragment
really
belonged
to
the
holy
cross
then
he
bent
his
knee
before
his
charming
mistress
who
with
a
deep
blush
on
her
cheeks
gave
the
man
she
had
long
but
secretly
loved
love
first
kiss
a
happy
marriage
was
speedily
celebrated
in
heimburg
the
knight
of
ravensberg
then
called
his
castle
spanheim
span
being
the
german
word
for
chip
in
memory
of
the
precious
little
relic
this
name
was
later

on

now
hearing
that
they
still
continued
their

the

appeared
himself
in

to
annihilate
them
and
to
destroy

was
an
awful
sight
to

members
of
these
ancient
noble
races
met
the
death

to

place

silently
and
mournfully
taking
away
the
bodies

preserve

buried

in

wise
counsel
of
a
priest

the
bodies
had
been
hanged
were
cut
down

to
build

also
taken
from

rhine
near
assmannshausen
the
day
arrived
a
day
of
great
sorrow
and
weeping
when
all
was
ready
and
the
priest
was
to
read
prayers
from
the
altar
for
the
first
time
many
funeral
barges
were
to
be
seen
on
the
river
bringing
the
dead
who
were
buried
in
the
aisle
of
the
church
the
archbishop
of
mayence
absolved
the
bodies
from
their
sins
and
afterwards
they
were
all
interred
together
near
the
little
church
for
the
second
time
this
occurred
towards
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
for
long
years
afterwards
prayers
were
offered
up
in
this
church
in
assmannshausen
for
the
souls
of
the
dead
the
once
proud
and
mighty
races
gradually
died
out
and
their
strongholds
fell
into
ruins
and
time
which
had
demolished
the
castles
on
the
heights
above
began
her
work
of
destruction
on
the
little
church
below
its
roof
decayed
and
its
walls
crumbled
the
ancient
little
church
of
clement
has
since
that
time
been
raised
again
from
its
ruins
and
now
the
voice
of
god
priest
is
heard
chanting
in
it
again
as
it
was
heard
six
hundred
years
ago

in
castle
rheinstein
once
lived
a
knight
called
diethelm
who
devoted
himself
without
restraint
to
all
the
excesses
of
the
robber
barons
from
one
of
his
pillaging
expeditions
he
brought
back
a
charming
maiden
called
jutta
as
the
delicate
ivy
twines
itself
round
the
rough
oak
and
clothes
its
knotty
stem
with
shimmering
velvet
so
in
time
the
gentle
conduct
of
this
maiden
changed
the
coarse
baron
to
a
noble
knight
who
eschewed
pillaging
and
carousing
and
ultimately
made
the
fair
jutta
the
honoured
wife
of
her
captor
the
first
fruit
of
their
love
cost
the
tender
mother
her
life
gerda
however
who
much
resembled
her
mother
grew
to
such
a
noble
beauty
that
soon
wooers
from
far
and
near
came
to
sue
for
the
hand
of
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
aged
diethelm
but
the
aged
knight
made
a
most
careful
selection
and
many
gay
wooers
had
to
depart
in
sorrow
one
young
man
was
however
regarded
favourably
by
the
maid
and
not
unkindly
looked
upon
by
the
old
man
he
was
the
oldest
son
of
the
owner
of
the
sternburg
this
young
man
had
contrived
to
win
the
maiden
heart
and
one
day
while
gerda
presided
as
queen
of
love
and
beauty
at
a
tournament
held
in
the
courtyard
of
castle
rheinstein
helmbrecht
made
an
avowal
of
his
love
some
days
thereafter
the
young
lord
according
to
courtly
fashion
appointed
his
uncle
gunzelin
of
reichenstein
to
woo
his
chosen
bride
for
him
but
gunzelin
though
an
old
man
was
full
of
knavery
and
falsehood
and
so
instead
of
wooing
for
his
nephew
he
ingratiated
himself
with
gerda
father
moreover
as
the
old
knight
was
descended
from
an
ancient
family
and
possessed
of
much
wealth
diethelm
was
easily
induced
to
promise
him
the
hand
of
the
fair
gerda
to
the
astonishment
of
this
worthy
pair
gerda
would
not
listen
to
the
suit
of
her
rich
wooer
her
heart
belonged
to
the
nephew
not
to
the
uncle
now
count
diethelm
was
aroused
and
with
the
blind
fury
of
his
earlier
years
swore
to
his
rich
companion
that
gerda
belonged
to
him
and
should
never
wed
the
young
of
the
sternburg
in
her
quiet
chamber
the
unhappy
maid
wept
out
her
heart
grief
but
burning
tears
did
not
thaw
the
heart
of
the
father
in
vain
the
young
lover
tried
to
gain
the
old
knight
favour
but
diethelm
merely
referred
to
his
knightly
word
solemnly
pledged
to
the
lord
of
reichenstein
soon
the
day
approached
on
which
gunzelin
with
the
smiling
of
an
old
roué
and
decked
out
to
give
himself
all
the
appearance
of
young
manhood
was
to
lead
the
fairest
maiden
in
the
rhineland
to
his
stately
castle
gerda
who
possessed
the
mild
disposition
of
her
deceased
mother
had
submitted
to
the
inevitable
on
a
bright
summer
morning
the
bridal
procession
started
from
the
courtyard
of
castle
rheinstein
and
moved
towards
the
clement
chapel
situated
in
the
neighbourhood
horns
blew
and
trumpets
sounded
on
a
milkwhite
palfrey
sat
the
fair
young
bride
deadly
pale
she
was
thinking
of
her
absent
lover
who
in
this
hour
must
be
enduring
the
greatest
anguish
on
her
account
then
all
at
once
a
swarm
of
buzzing
gadflies
came
out
of
the
bush
and
fastened
fiercely
on
the
palfrey
which
bore
the
fair
gerda
the
animal
reared
and
broke
from
the
bridal
procession
boldly
the
bridegroom
on
his
grandly
caparisoned
steed
dashed
forward
to
check
the
frightened
animal
but
his
missing
its
footing
on
the
narrow
bridle
path
fell
over
a
precipice
carrying
its
master
with
it
the
dying
knight
was
carried
by
the
back
to
castle
rheinstein
the
aged
diethelm
was
also
unfortunate
in
his
attempt
to
stop
the
runaway
steed
the
maddened
animal
had
struck
him
on
the
shinbone
and
wounded
him
the
servants
were
thus
obliged
to
carry
the
moaning
greybeard
back
to
his
castle
as
speedily
and
carefully
as
possible
the
surgeon
had
a
sad
time
of
it
during
the
next
week
as
he
attended
to
the
enraged
old
knight
wounds
and
bruises
when
the
runaway
horse
had
disappeared
round
a
bend
of
the
path
a
man
threw
himself
upon
it
and
bringing
the
trembling
animal
to
a
standstill
clasped
the
unconscious
bride
in
his
arms
helmbrecht
concealed
in
the
brushwood
had
been
watching
the
bridal
procession
and
now
came
to
the
rescue
of
his
true
love
when
the
old
lord
heard
of
this
he
came
to
his
senses
and
gave
the
lovers
his
blessing
some
weeks
later
a
bridal
procession
advanced
from
the
clement
chapel
up
to
the
festively
decorated
castle
rheinstein
trumpets
were
blown
and
horns
resounded
much
more
joyfully
than
on
the
previous
occasion
the
musicians
marched
in
front
upon
a
milkwhite
palfrey
as
formerly
sat
a
noble
maiden
in
bridal
state
clothed
in
undulating
robes
bordered
with
fur
her
head
was
bent
in
maiden
modesty
as
she
listened
to
the
endearments
which
the
youthful
knight
whispered
in
her
ear
behind
rode
the
father
of
the
bride
sunk
in
thought
and
along
with
him
was
his
pious
sister

of
unalloyed

wanton

with
showy

in

arms
of
tipsy
cavaliers
the
music
blared
and
to
complete
their
carousal
wine
flowed
freely
the
lord
of
sooneck
flushed
with
drinking
and
leering
on
the
assembly
with
eyes
spoke
as
follows
noble
ladies
drunken
applause
from
his
worthy
associates
and
nobles
loudly
giggled
the
shameless
females
after
food
and

as
your
host
will
be
pleased
to
entertain
you
by
bringing
before
you
a
ferocious
animal
which
i
keep
confined
here
while
the
ladies
pretended
to
take
shelter
timidly
behind
their
lords
and
the
men
stared
at
their
host
expecting
some
further
explanation
the
doors
of
the
room
opened
and
led
by
two
servants
a
man
in
coarse
garments
and
with
unkempt
hair
and
beard
stood
before
them
a
suppressed
whisper
passed
round
the
festive
board
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
haggard
countenance
of
the
prisoner
when
for
a
moment
the
weary
eyelids
were
raised
two
ghastly
cavities
were
visible
again
with
the
same
tone
of
levity
the
lord
of
the
castle
spoke
lovely
ladies
and
knightly
companions
the
best
marksman
on
the

of

like
ourselves
he
was
dreaded
far
and
near
he
and
i
entered
on
a
feud
of
life
and
death
he
went
down
with
broken
brand
and
battered
shield
bleeding
from
numerous
wounds
i
lay
prostrate
before
you
awaiting
manfully
the
murmured
the
prisoner
and
his
voice
sounded
as
if
from
the
grave
it
pained
me
to
finish
him
off
said
siebold
flippantly
i
got
his
two
eyes
taken
out
and
thus
added
to
my
collection
of
rarities
the
best
archer
on
the
rhine
my
murdered
eyes
behold
your
scorn
said
the
prisoner
harshly
but
surely
chivalry
still
flourishes
on
sooneck
said
the
lord
of
the
castle
understand
then
that
my
servants
have
informed
me
that
even
blind
you
can
guided
only
by
sounds
hit
a
given
mark
with
a
bolt
if
you
come
out
of
this
ordeal
successful
freedom
shall
be
the
reward
stormy
applause
greeted
these
words
death
were
dearer
to
me
than
life
murmured
the
blind
archer
as
he
seized
the
crossbow
however
a
gleam
of
joy
went
over
his
countenance
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
over
a
sombre
landscape
crowded
together
in
a
corner
of
the
room
the
guests
watched
the
proceedings
the
lord
of
sooneck
seized
a
goblet
and
ordered
the
prisoner
to
draw
upon
it
after
hearing
the
sound
in
the
next
moment
the
silver
clang
resounded
as
the
goblet
fell
on
the
floor
shoot
now
said
siebold
of
sooneck
and
immediately
an
arrow
pierced
his
mouth
with
a
grunt
like
a
slaughtered
ox
siebold
sank
among
the
rushes
silent
and
motionless
with
the
two
gaping
stood
the
blind
man
then
his
shaggy
head
sank
on
his
heaving
breast
like
a
flock
of
frightened
crows
the
knights
and
their
paramours
fled
and
only
a
few
terrified
squires
and
servants
muttered
prayers
over
the
body
of
the
lord
of
sooneck
the
ruins
of
fürstenberg
the
mother
ghost
lambert
of
fürstenberg
was
a
hearty
jovial
knight
and
had
married
wiltrud
a
daughter
of
the
florsheim
family
he
was
attached
to
his
gentle
wife
who
had
just
presented
him
with
a
son
and
heir
but
an
evil
genius
entered
the
castle
in
the
person
of
a
noble
maiden
called
luckharde
this
maiden
who
had
suddenly
been
left
an
orphan
belonged
to
a
family
long
befriended
by
the
house
of
fürstenberg
she
was
only
eighteen
but
possessed
a
lascivious
beauty
very
dangerous
to
men
the
lady
of
the
castle
who
had
been
in
delicate
health
since
the
birth
of
her
child
gave
luckharde
a
welcome
into
the
bosom
of
her
family
trusting
that
the
young
woman
would
be
of
great
service
to
her
in
the
management
of
her
little
realm
and
would
repay
her
kindness
by
sisterly
love
and
sympathy
luckharde
however
was
of
a
vain
and
frivolous
disposition
and
had
little
love
for
household
affairs
or
womanly
duties
as
the
months
passed
luckharde
ripening
and
dangerous
beauty
gained
gradually
and
almost
imperceptibly
more
and
more
influence
over
the
susceptible
heart
of
the
lord
of
the
castle
and
soon
the
day
came
when
he
yielded
himself
entirely
to
the
charms
of
this
beautiful
woman
wiltrud
eyes
were
by
no
means
blind
to
the
shameful
ingratitude
of
the
adulteress
and
the
godless
conduct
of
her
husband
her
weakness
however
prevented
her
from
calling
down
the
judgment
of
heaven
on
the
sinners
luckharde
led
on
by
her
unbridled
passion
now
formed
a
devilish
design
which
would
enable
her
to
take
the
place
of
the
lawful
wife
of
lambert
one
night
she
slipped
into
the
chamber
of
the
lady
of
the
castle
approached
the
bed
of
the
sleeping
woman
with
a
step
and
smothered
her
with
the
pillows
the
poor
invalid
offering
but
a
feeble
and
ineffective
resistance
wiltrud
death
was
deeply
mourned
by
the
household
who
believed
that
she
had
died
of
a
broken
heart
lambert
too
might
be
grieved
but
in
the
arms
of
his
enchantress
he
soon
forgot
his
deceased
wife
and
in
a
few
weeks
luckharde
was
made
lady
of
fürstenberg
the
little
boy
whom
wiltrud
had
borne
to
her
unfaithful
husband
was
hateful
to
the
second
wife
who
fondled
her
lord
and
flattered
him
with
the
hope
of
the
children
she
would
bear
him
then
it
was
arranged
that
the
knight
should
be
handed
over
to
the
care
of
an
old
crone
who
lived
in
a
remote
tower
of
the
castle
one
night
this
old
woman
awoke
suddenly
and
was
terrified
to
see
a
female
form
dressed
in
a
flowing
white
robe
bending
over
the
cradle
of
the
little
boy
who
slept
near
the
woman
seemed
to
be
tending
the
child
and
after
blessing
him
she
vanished
the
old
woman
crossed
herself
and
in
terror
muttered
many
prayers
in
the
early
morning
she
hurried
to
her
new
mistress
in
great
agitation
and
with
white
lips
told
her
of
her
strange
visitor
luckharde
at
first
laughed
in
her
usual
frivolous
manner
at
this
ridiculous
ghost
story
but
soon
she
became
more
serious
and
alarmed
then
she
ordered
the
old
woman
to
arrange
her
bed
beside
the
other
servants
but
still
to
leave
the
child
in
the
a
dreadful
fear
had
taken
possession
of
luckharde
guilty
soul
perhaps
people
were
deceived
when
they
believed
wiltrud
to
be
dead
and
it
was
thus
that
she
returned
at
night
to
nurse
her
child
then
this
daring
and
sinful
woman
prepared
a
bed
for
herself
in
the
lonely
tower
beside
the
child
she
also
brought
with
her
a
formidable
dagger
and
thus
she
awaited
what
the
night
might
bring
forth
at
midnight
the
female
figure
dressed
in
the
flowing
white
robe
appeared
once
more
it
approached
the
cradle
of
the
child
tended
him
and
blessed
him
then
the
luckharde
stared
motionless
at
the
apparition
as
it
rose
and
approached
her
bed
towering
there
above
her
were
the
pallid
features
of
the
dead
wiltrud
and
the
lifeless
entreating
eyes
looked
steadily
at
this
sinful
woman
who
had
taken
the
place
of
her
benefactress
to
luckharde
it
seemed
as
if
a
great
precipice
was
slowly
bending
over
to
overwhelm
her
with
a
last
mad
effort
the
wretched
woman
seized
the
dagger
and
struck
at
the
apparition
but
she
might
as
well
have
struck
at
a
misty
cloud
now
luckharde
perceived
that
she
was
in
the
presence
of
the
murdered
lady
of
the
fürstenberg
and
harrowed
with
the
thought
of
her
guilt
she
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
as
if
from
another
world
saying
do
penance
for
thy
sins
next
morning
lambert
waited
in
vain
for
his
wife
to
appear
on
looking
around
however
he
noticed
a
piece
of
parchment
on
it
luckharde
had
confessed
with
deep
sorrow
how
she
had
murdered
his
first
wife
in
order
to
further
her
evil
designs
and
how
the
spirit
of
the
dead
had
appeared
to
her
in
the
night
and
warned
her
of
her
great
guilt
she
was
going
to
fly
to
a
cloister
to
do
penance
during
the
remainder
of
her
days
and
she
recommended
her
sinful
accomplice
to
do
the
same
lambert
of
fürstenberg
was
deeply
grieved
on
receiving
this
revelation
he
handed
over
his
castle
and
child
to
a
younger
brother
and
spent
the
rest
of
this
life
as
a
solitary
hermit
bacharach

stahleck
ancient
bacharach
was
once
a
famous
place
and
long
before
the
fiery
wine
that
grows
there
became
famous
throughout
the
world
it
was
in
the
good
old
times
as
our
grandmothers
say
it
was
the
delight
of
many
a
connoisseur
abroad
about
that
time
its
grateful
lovers
erected
an
altar
to
bacchus
who
provided
them
so
liberally
with
wine
the
place
of
sacrifice
was
on
a
huge
rock
projecting
out
of
the

between
an
island

the
right
bank
of

old
custom
but
now
more
as
an
amusement
they
dress
up
a

bacchus
place
him
on
the
altar
and
surround
him
singing
the
ruins
of
the
castle
of
stahleck
are
situated
on
the
rhine
above
the
wild
romantic
country
of
bacharach
about
the
time
of
conrad
the
first
emperor
of
the
house
of
hohenstaufen
a
young
ambitious
knight
palatinate
count
hermann
inhabited
this
castle
being
a
nephew
of
the
emperor
this
aspiring
knight
considered
his
high
and
mighty
relationship
as
a
sufficient
reason
for
enlarging
his
dominions
he
conceived
no
less
a
plan
than
that
of
taking
possession
of
part
of
the
property
which
bordered
on
his
land
belonging
to
the
archbishops
of
mayence
and
treves
supporting
his
claim
by
declaring
that
for
more
than
one
reason
he
had
a
right
of
possession
the
jealousy
which
at
that
time
existed
between
the
clerical
and
the
secular
powers
brought
a
number
of
neighbouring
knights
to
his
side
as
allies
and
the
count
began
his
unprovoked
quarrel
by
taking
a
castle
at
treves
on
the
moselle
by
storm
this
castle
belonged
to
the
diocese
of
that
town
adalbert
of
monstereil
a
man
of
an
undaunted
character
was
then
bishop
both
of
treves
and
metz
he
at
once
collected
his
warriors
to
drive
the
bold
robber
from
the
conquered
castle
the
temerity
of
the
count
and
his
superior
forces
dismayed
adalbert
giving
him
grounds
for
sober
reflections
but
the
good
bishop
was
a
clever
man
and
not
believing
himself
sufficiently
strong
to
resist
the
count
he
sought
refuge
in
spiritual
weapons
when
his
people
were
about
to
assault
the
stronghold
he
made
a
most
enthusiastic
speech
to
his
troops
holding
up
a
crucifix
in
his
right
hand
he
told
to
them
that
in
the
silent
hours
of
the
previous
night
the
archangel
michael
had
appeared
to
him
and
had
given
him
this
crucifix
at
the
same
time
promising
him
certain
victory
if
each
of
his
warriors
attacked
the
enemy
in
the
firm
belief
that
an
invincible
higher
power
was
near
to
help
them
the
bishop
words
inspired
his
men
with
a
great
courage
led
on
by
the
holy
man
carrying
the
crucifix
in
his
raised
hand
they
marched
on
to
the
assault
stormed
the
castle
and
made
hermann
troops
flee
in
great
confusion
the
ambitious
count
now
finding
himself
deserted
by
his
troops
was
forced
to
renounce
the
feud
which
he
had
hoped
to
carry
on
against
the
bishop
the
disgraceful
defeat
the
count
had
suffered
was
most
humiliating
to
him
but
it
had
not
killed
his
ambition
he
now
directed
his
thoughts
to
his
other
ecclesiastical
neighbour
having
searched
through
some
ancient
documents
he
thought
he
had
found
full
right
to
a
strip
of
land
which
arnold
of
solnhofen
bishop
of
mayence
then
held
in
possession
he
at
once
sent
in
his
claim
to
this
mighty
prince
of
the
church
who
received
it
with
a
scornful
laugh
oh
said
the
bishop
tearing
up
the
written
complaint
i
shall
be
able
to
manage
this
little
count
as
well
as
i
have
all
along
managed
the
stubborn
people
of
mayence
some
of
whom
have
bitterly
repented
of
having
rebelled
against
their
bishop
hermann
was
told
how
solnhofen
had
treated
his
claim
in
great
wrath
he
swore
to
take
vengeance
on
the
man
who
had
dared
to
tear
up
his
complaint
so
contumeliously
his
young
wife
implored
him
with
tears
in
her
eyes
not
to
raise
his
hand
against
a
servant
of
the
lord
again
but
he
turned
contemptuously
away
herman
was
well
aware
that
through
the
influence
of
the
he
was
now
hated
by
the
citizens
of
mayence
this
circumstance
made
him
determine
to
rob
arnold
of
land
and
dignity
as
he
ascribed
the
cause
of
this
deadly
dissension
to
the
power
the
bishop
exerted
over
the
people
of
his
diocese
the
count
now
joined
by
several
daring
knights
again
prepared
to
make
war
against
the
representative
of
the
church
and
marched
to
attack
the
bishop
in
his
stronghold
arnold
was
enraged
at
this
persistent
striving
against
the
dominions
of
the
church
and
his
dark
soul
conceived
a
dastardly
plan
to
rid
them
of
their
enemy
he
hired
two
villains
who
treacherously
put
the
count
to
death
soon
afterwards
the
rebellious
citizens
of
mayence
successfully
stormed
the
bishop
palace
and
turned
the
cruel
prelate
out
of
his
episcopal
seat
whereupon
he
was
obliged
to
flee
for
his
life
but
arnold
was
not
so
easily
subdued
and
he
soon
returned
breathing
vengeance
his
friends
warned
him
in
vain
and
even
the
famous
prophetess
hildegarde
of
rupertusberg
sent
a
messenger
to
him
with
the
words
turn
to
the
lord
whom
you
have
forsaken
your
hour
is
near
at
hand
but
he
heeded
not
this
admonition
and
at
last
he
was
killed
by
the
rebels
in
the
abbey
of
jacobsberg
some
distance
from
the
town
where
he
had
taken
up
his
residence

about
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
there
was
a
stately
castle
near
kaub
which
was
inhabited
by
count
philip
of
falkenstein
there
he
lived
very
happily
with
his
beautiful
sister
guta
who
was
as
good
as
she
was
fair
numerous
knights
had
sought
to
win
her
love
but
none
had
achieved
this
conquest
the
castle
maiden
having
no
desire
to
exchange
her
brother
hospitable
home
for
any
other
at
that
time
a
magnificent
tournament
was
held
at
cologne
to
which
knights
from
all
countries
of
the
kingdom
far
and
near
and
even
from
england
were
invited
a
great
multitude
of
spectators
were
assembled
to
see
the
stately
knights
contending
for
the
prize
which
a
fair
hand
would
bestow
on
them
among
the
nobles
present
at
the
tournament
was
a
knight
from
england
whose
graceful
figure
and
splendid
armour
were
particularly
striking
he
wore
a
veiled
visor
and
the
stewards
of
the
tournament
announced
him
under
the
name
of
the
lion
knight
a
golden
lion
ornamenting
his
shield
soon
the
majestic
knight
manner
of
fighting
created
a
great
sensation
and
when
he
succeeded
in
unhorsing
his
opponent
a
most
formidable
combatant
loud
rejoicings
rang
through
the
lists
count
philip
and
his
sister
were
among
the
guests
guta
had
been
watching
the
strange
knight
with
ever
increasing
interest
during
the
tournament
regretting
at
the
same
time
that
she
could
not
see
his
face
but
an
opportunity
soon
presented
itself
when
the
knight
was
declared
victor
when
she
was
selected
to
present
the
prize
a
golden
to
the
winner
she
became
much
embarrassed
and
a
feeling
such
as
she
had
never
before
experienced
seized
her
as
she
looked
at
the
briton
face
for
the
first
time
perhaps
the
knight
may
have
read
in
the
lovely
maiden
countenance
what
she
in
vain
tried
to
hide
from
him
perhaps
a
spark
from
that
passionate
fire
which
had
so
suddenly
fired
her
heart
may
have
flown
into
his
soul
as
he
knelt
before
her
to
receive
the
wreath
which
she
placed
on
his
head
with
a
trembling
hand
who
can
tell
afterwards
when
these
two
were
conversing
together
in
subdued
whispers
the
knight
silently
admiring
her
grace
and
the
maiden
scarcely
able
to
restrain
her
feelings
the
thoughts
which
he
longed
to
tell
her
flamed
in
his
heart
the
same
evening
in
the
banqueting
hall
when
the
music
was
sounding
within
its
walls
he
was
inseparable
companion
and
eloquent
words
flowed
from
his
lips
telling
her
of
the
love
which
his
eyes
betrayed
the
proud
stranger
begged
guta
for
her
love
and
swore
to
be
hers
he
told
her
he
must
at
once
return
to
his
country
where
urgent
duty
called
him
but
that
he
would
come
back
to
claim
her
in
three
time
then
he
would
publicly
sue
for
her
hand
and
declare
his
name
which
circumstances
compelled
him
to
keep
secret
for
the
time
being
love
will
make
any
sacrifice
guta
accepted
her
lover
pledge
willingly
and
thus
they
parted
under
the
assurance
that
they
would
soon
meet
again
five
months
had
passed
that
terrible
time
ensued
when
germany
became
the
of
the
over
the
election
of
the
emperor
conrad
the
last
of
the
house
of
hohenstaufen
had
died
in
italy
in
the
northern
countries
there
was
a
great
rising
against
william
of
holland
who
was
struggling
for
the
imperial
throne
alphonso
of
castile
was
chosen
king
in
one
part
of
the
country
while
richard
of
cornwall
son
of
john
king
of
england
was
elected
in
another
but
richard
having
received
most
influential
votes
was
crowned
at
and
from
thence
he
started
on
a
journey
through
the
rhine
provinces
to
the
favour
of
which
he
had
been
chiefly
indebted
for
his
election
spring
was
casting
her
bright
beams
over
waves
and
mountains
in
the
valley
of
the
rhine
but
in
falkenstein
castle
no
ray
of
sunshine
penetrated
the
gloom
guta
pale
and
unhappy
sat
within
its
walls
weaving
dreams
which
seemed
destined
never
to
be
fulfilled
sometimes
she
saw
her
lover
dying
on
a
terrible
with
her
name
on
his
lips
then
again
laughing
and
bright
with
a
maiden
from
that
island
in
his
arms
talking
derisively
of
his
sweetheart
on
the
rhine
she
became
more
and
more
conscious
that
she
had
given
him
her
first
love
and
that
he
had
cruelly
deceived
her
sorrow
and
grief
had
taken
possession
of
her
and
all
her
brother
efforts
to
amuse
her
and
to
distract
her
attention
were
in
vain
a
great
sound
of
trumpets
was
heard
one
day
on
the
highway
and
a
troop
of
knights
stopped
at
the
castle
guta
saw
the
train
of
warriors
from
her
window
where
she
had
been
sitting
weeping
the
count
with
chivalrous
hospitality
received
them
and
led
them
into
the
his
astonishment
was
great
when
he
recognised
the
bold
briton
the
victor
at
the
tournament
in
cologne
as
leader
of
this
brilliant
retinue
he
who
had
broken
his
secret
pledge
to
his
beloved
sister
a
dark
glance
took
the
place
of
the
friendly
expression
on
his
face
the
briton
seemed
to
notice
it
and
pressing
philip
hand
said
cordially
i
am
richard
of
cornwall
elected
emperor
of
germany
and
i
have
come
here
to
solicit
the
hand
of
your
sister
guta
who
promised
herself
to
me
five
months
ago
in
cologne
i
come
late
to
redeem
my
promise
but
my
love
is
unchanged
i
beg
you
to
announce
my
arrival
to
her
without
betraying
my
name
philip
bowed
deeply
before
the
illustrious
guest
and
the
retainers
respectfully
retired
to
a
distance
the
great
guest
strode
up
and
down
the
room
impatiently
then
the
doors
were
suddenly
thrown
open
and
a
beautiful
figure
appeared
on
the
threshold
her
face
glowing
with
emotion
with
a
low
cry
guta
threw
herself
into
her
lover
arms
and
the
first
moments
of
their
reunion
were
passed
in
silent
happiness
philip
now
entered
the
room
unperceived
and
revealed
the
secret
to
his
sister
the
maiden
in
great
confusion
and
shame
stole
a
look
at
her
lover
eyes
and
he
drawing
her
gently
to
him
asked
her
to
share
all
even
his
throne
with
him
shortly
afterwards
richard
celebrated
his
marriage
with
imperial
magnificence
at
the
castle
on
the
rhine
which
philip
thence
forward
called
gutenfels
in
honour
of
his
sister
oberwesel
the
seven
maidens
the
scattered
ruins
of
an
old
knight
tower
are
still
to
be
seen
on
one
of
the
heights
near
oberwesel
the
castle
was
called
schönberg
after
the
seven
virgins
who
once
lived
there
and
whose
beauty
was
renowned
throughout
all
the
rhine
countries
their
father
had
died
early
some
say
of
grief
because
heaven
had
denied
him
a
son
and
an
elderly
aunt
had
striven
in
vain
to
guide
the
seven
wild
sisters
but
her
influence
had
not
been
sufficiently
strong
to
lead
them
in
the
right
way
after
the
death
of
this
relative
the
seven
beautiful
maidens
were
left
to
themselves
and
now
their
longing
after
liberty
and
the
pleasures
of
the
world
broke
out
even
stronger
than
before
many
a
tale
was
told
about
them
how
they
used
to
ride
out
hunting
and
hawking
how
many
a
magnificent
banquet
was
given
by
them
and
how
their
beauty
their
riches
and
the
gay
and
joyous
life
led
by
them
attracted
many
knights
from
near
and
far
how
many
a
stately
noble
came
to
their
castle
to
woo
one
of
the
sisters
and
how
these
maidens
at
first
ensnared
and
enchanted
him
with
a
thousand
attractive
charms
only
in
the
end
to
reject
the
enamoured
suitor
with
scorn
and
mockery
ashamed
and
very
wrathful
many
a
great
knight
had
left
the
castle
and
with
indignation
and
disdain
had
blotted
out
of
his
memory
the
names
of
these
bewitching
sirens
who
at
first
had
listened
with
deceitful
modesty
to
his
honest
wooing
only
afterwards
to
declare
with
scornful
laughter
that
their
liberty
was
so
dear
to
them
that
they
would
not
give
it
up
for
the
sake
of
any
man
alas
there
were
always
youths
to
be
found
who
put
no
faith
in
such
speeches
and
trusting
to
their
great
names
and
peculiar
merits
sought
their
happiness
among
these
maidens
but
all
the
trials
ended
in
the
same
mournful
manner
no
suitor
succeeded
in
winning
the
heart
of
these
seductive
beings
thus
they
continued
their
dangerous
and
contemptible
life
for
some
years
once
again
there
was
a
great
banquet
and
feasting
in
the
halls
of
the
castle
a
circle
of
knightly
figures
sat
round
the
brilliant
board
among
the
seven
sisters
who
were
quite
conscious
of
their
charms
one
rivalling
the
other
in
gaiety
and
liveliness
the
joyous
scene
was
disturbed
for
a
short
time
by
two
knights
who
were
disputing
about
one
of
the
sisters
and
had
angered
each
other
by
their
growing
jealousy
the
scene
excited
general
attention
and
was
looked
on
at
first
as
a
most
amusing
one
but
when
the
youths
were
about
to
draw
their
swords
it
was
thought
necessary
to
separate
them
seizing
this
opportunity
one
of
the
other
knights
proposed
that
to
guard
against
further
discord
the
castle
maidens
should
be
urged
to
make
a
final
decision
so
that
each
suitor
they
all
recognised
one
another
as
such
might
know
what
he
had
to
expect
the
proposal
met
with
general
applause
only
the
sisters
showed
discontentment
declaring
they
could
not
agree
to
such
a
presumptuous
plan
however
the
wooers
tried
every
imaginable
means
of
persuading
them
and
at
last
one
of
the
sisters
wavered
a
second
followed
her
example
and
the
remaining
ones
after
whispering
to
each
other
for
some
time
declared
with
laughing
countenances
that
they
would
decide
the
fate
of
their
suitors
the
next
day
the
expected
hour
arrived
and
the
knights
in
great
suspense
assembled
in
the
large
hall
every
eye
was
riveted
on
the
door
through
which
these
graces
should
enter
bringing
a
sweet
surprise
to
some
or
a
bitter
disappointment
to
others
the
were
suddenly
thrown
open
and
an
attendant
announced
that
the
mistresses
of
the
castle
were
waiting
to
receive
the
knights
in
the
garden
near
the
river
the
numerous
suitors
all
hurried
out
to
their
great
astonishment
they
saw
the
fair
ones
all
seated
in
a
boat
on
the
rhine
with
a
peculiar
smile
they
beckoned
the
knights
to
approach
and
the
eldest
sister
standing
up
in
her
seat
made
the
following
speech
you
may
all
throw
your
hopes
to
the
winds
for
not
one
of
us
would
dream
of
falling
in
love
with
you
much
less
of
marrying
you
our
liberty
is
much
too
precious
to
us
and
we
shall
not
sacrifice
it
for
any
man
we
are
going
to
sail
down
to
cologne
to
the
property
of
a
relation
and
there
we
shall
disappoint
other
suitors
just
as
we
have
misled
you
my
noble
lords
the
scornful
speech
was
accompanied
by
a
scoffing
laugh
which
was
by
the
other
sisters
and
the
boat
set
sail
the
rejected
suitors
stood
speechless
with
shame
and
anger
suddenly
a
terrible
storm
arose
the
boat
was
agitated
violently
and
the
laughter
of
the
seven
sisters
was
turned
to
cries
for
help
but
the
roaring
of
the
waves
drowned
their
voices
and
the
billows
rushed
over
the
boat
burying
it
and
the
seven
sisters
in
the
depths
below
just
on
the
spot
where
these
maidens
met
their
deaths
seven
pointed
rocks
appeared
above
the
surface
of
the
water
which
up
to
the
present
day
are
still
to
be
seen
a
salutary
warning
to
all
the
young

where
the
rhine
flows
through
hills
covered
with
vineyards
there
is
a
steep
rock
round
which
many
a
legend
has
been
woven
the
lurlei
rock
the
boatman
gazes
up
at
its
gigantic
summit
with
awful
reverence
when
his
boat
glides
over
the
waters
at
twilight
like
chattering
children
the
restless
waves
whisper
round
the
rock
telling
wonderful
tales
of
its
doings
above
on
its
gray
head
the
legend
relates
that
a
beautiful
but
false
nymph
clothed
in
white
with
a
wreath
of
stars
in
her
flowing
hair
used
to
sit
and
sing
sweet
songs
until
a
sad
tragedy
drove
her
forever
away
long
long
ago
when
night
in
her
dark
garment
descended
from
the
hills
and
her
silent
comrade
the
pale
moon
cast
a
silver
bridge
over
the
deep
green
stream
the
soft
voice
of
a
woman
was
heard
from
the
rock
and
a
creature
of
divine
beauty
was
seen
on
its
summit
her
golden
locks
flowed
like
a
queenly
mantle
from
her
graceful
shoulders
covering
her
raiment
so
that
her
body
appeared
like
a
cloud
of
light
woe
to
the
boatsman
who
passed
the
rock
at
the
close
of
day
as
of
old
men
were
fascinated
by
the
heavenly
song
of
the
grecian
hero
so
was
the
unhappy
voyager
allured
by
this
being
to
sweet
forgetfulness
his
eyes
even
as
his
soul
would
be
dazzled
and
he
could
no
longer
steer
clear
of
reefs
and
cliffs
and
this
beautiful
siren
only
drew
him
to
an
early
grave
forgetting
all
else
he
would
steer
towards
her
already
dreaming
of
having
reached
her
but
the
jealous
waves
would
wash
round
his
boat
and
at
last
dash
him
treacherously
against
the
rocks
the
roaring
waters
of
the
rhine
would
drown
the
cries
of
agony
of
the
victim
who
would
never
be
seen
again
but
the
virgin
to
whom
no
one
had
ever
approached
continued
every
night
to
sing
soft
and
low
till
darkness
vanished
in
the
first
rays
of
light
and
the
great
star
of
day
drove
the
gray
mists
from

valley
ii
ronald
was
a
proud
youth
and
the
boldest
warrior
at
the
court
of
his
father
the
palatinate
count
he
heard
of
this
divine
enchanting
creature
and
his
heart
burned
with
the
desire
to
behold
her
before
having
seen
the
water
nymph
he
felt
drawn
to
her
by
an
irresistible
power
under
pretence
of
hunting
he
left
the
court
and
succeeded
in
getting
an
old
sailor
to
row
him
to
the
rock
twilight
was
brooding
over
the
valley
of
the
rhine
when
the
boat
approached
the
gigantic
cliff
the
departing
sun
had
long
sunk
below
the
mountains
and
now
night
was
creeping
on
in
silence
the
evening
star
was
twinkling
in
the
deep
blue
firmament
was
it
his
who
had
placed
it
there
as
a
warning
to
the
deluded
young
man
he
gazed
at
it
in
rapture
for
some
time
until
a
low
cry
from
the
old
man
at
his
side
interrupted
him
the
lorelei
whispered
he
startled
do
you
see
her
the
enchantress
the
only
answer
was
a
soft
murmur
which
escaped
from
the
youth
with
eyes
he
looked
up
and
lo
there
she
was
yes
this
was
she
this
wonderful
creature
a
glorious
picture
in
a
dark
frame
yes
that
was
her
golden
hair
and
those
were
her
flowing
white
garments
she
was
hovering
up
above
on
the
rocks
combing
her
beautiful
hair
rays
of
light
surrounded
her
graceful
head
revealing
her
charms
in
spite
of
the
night
and
the
distance
and
as
he
gazed
her
lips
opened
and
a
song
thrilled
through
the
silence
soft
and
plaintive
like
the
sweet
notes
of
a
nightingale
on
a
still
summer
evening
from
her
height
she
looked
down
into
the
hazy
distance
and
cast
at
the
youth
a
rapturous
look
which
sank
down
into
his
soul
thrilling
his
whole
frame
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
features
of
this
celestial
being
where
he
read
the
sweet
story
of
love
rocks
stream
glorious
night
all
melted
into
a
mist
before
his
eyes
he
saw
nothing
but
the
figure
above
nothing
but
her
radiant
eyes
the
boat
crept
along
too
slowly
for
him
he
could
no
longer
remain
in
it
and
if
his
ear
did
not
deceive
him
this
creature
seemed
to
whisper
his
name
with
unutterable
sweetness
and
calling
to
her
he
dashed
into
the
water
a
cry
echoed
from
the
rocks
and
the
waves
sighed
and
washed
over
the
unhappy
youth
corpse
the
old
boatman
moaned
and
crossed
himself
and
as
he
did
so
lightning
tore
the
clouds
asunder
and
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
was
heard
over
the
mountains
then
the
waves
whispered
gently
below
and
again
from
the
heights
above
sad
and
dying
away
sounded
the
song
iii
the
sad
news
was
soon
brought
to
the
palatinate
count
who
was
overpowered
with
grief
and
anger
he
ordered
the
false
enchantress
to
be
delivered
up
to
him
dead
or
alive
the
next
day
a
boat
sailed
down
the
rhine
manned
by
four
hardy
bold
warriors
the
leader
looked
up
sternly
at
the
great
rocks
which
seemed
to
be
smiling
silently
down
at
him
he
had
asked
permission
to
dash
the
diabolical
seducer
from
the
top
of
the
rocks
into
the
foaming
whirlpool
below
where
she
would
find
a
certain
death
and
the
count
had
readily
agreed
to
this
plan
of
revenge
iv
the
first
shades
of
twilight
were
gliding
softly
over
mountain
and
hill
the
rock
was
surrounded
by
armed
men
and
the
leader
followed
by
some
daring
comrades
was
climbing
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
the
top
of
which
was
veiled
in
a
golden
mist
which
the
men
thought
were
the
last
rays
of
sunset
it
was
a
bright
gleam
of
light
enshrouding
the
nymph
who
appeared
on
the
rocks
dreamingly
combing
her
golden
hair
she
then
took
a
string
of
pearls
from
her
bosom
and
with
her
slender
white
hand
bound
them
round
her
forehead
she
cast
a
mocking
glance
at
the
threatening
men
approaching
her
what
are
the
weak
sons
of
the
earth
seeking
up
here
on
the
heights
said
she
moving
her
rosy
lips
scornfully
you
sorceress
cried
the
leader
enraged
adding
with
a
contemptuous
smile
you
we
shall
dash
you
down
into
the
river
below
an
echoing
laugh
was
heard
over
the
mountain
oh
the
rhine
will
come
himself
to
fetch
me
cried
the
maiden
then
bending
her
slender
body
over
the
precipice
yawning
below
she
tore
the
jewels
from
her
forehead
hurling
them
triumphantly
into
the
waters
while
in
a
low
sweet
voice
she
sang
haste
thee
haste
thee
oh
father
dear
send
forth
thy
steeds
from
the
waters
clear
i
will
ride
with
the
waves
and
the
wind
then
a
storm
burst
forth
the
rhine
rose
covering
its
banks
with
foam
two
gigantic
billows
like
steeds
rose
out
of
the
depths
and
carried
the
nymph
down
into
the
rushing
current
the
terrified
messengers
returned
to
the
count
bringing
him
the
tidings
of
this
wonderful
event
ronald
whose
body
a
chance
wave
had
washed
up
on
the
banks
of
the
river
was
deeply
mourned
throughout
the
country
from
this
time
forth
the
lorelei
was
never
seen
again
only
when
night
sheds
her
dark
shadow
on
the
hills
and
the
pale
moon
weaves
a
silver
bridge
over
the
deep
green
stream
then
the
voice
of
a
woman
soft
and
low
is
heard
echoing
from
the
weird
heights
of
the
rocks
the
lorelei
has
vanished
but
her
charm
still
remains
thou
canst
find
it
o
wanderer
in
the
eyes
of
the
maidens
near
the
rhine
it
blooms
on
their
cheeks
it
lingers
on
their
rosy
lips
there
thou
wilt
find
its
traces
arm
thy
heart
steel
thy
will
blindfold
thine
eye
as
a
poet
of
the
rhine
once
wisely
and
warningly

rheinfels
george
linden
the
ruins
of
castle
rheinfels
which
stand
above
the
pretty
little
town
of
goar
are
the
most
extensive
of
their
kind
on
the
rhine
the
castle
was
erected
in
the
middle
of
the
century
by
count
dietherr
a
nobleman
belonging
to
the
famous
rhenish
family
of
katzenelnbogen
it
was
a
strongly
fortified
burg
and
within
ten
years
of
its
completion
the
mighty
ramparts
witnessed
several
bloody
encounters
rhenish
cities
once
combined
to
carry
the
invulnerable
fortress
but
though
some
lives
were
sacrificed
the
army
retreated
baffled
for
centuries
after
this
the
banner
of
the
hessian
landgraf
waved
from
its
battlements
none
daring
to
attack
it
then
the
fanatic
gallic
forces
of
the
revolution
entered
the
rhineland
and
laid
the
magnificent
castle
in
ruins
there
is
a
legend
associated
with
rheinfels
which
dates
from
that
age
of
chivalry
when
noble
knights
and
their
squires
trod
its
courts
and
this
legend
seems
touched
with
the
sadness
of
the
history
of
the
castle
itself
the
count
of
rheinfels
was
the
proud
father
of
a
lovely
daughter
and
among
her
numerous
wooers
it
was
george
brömser
of
rüdesheim
who
had
won
the
maiden
heart
no
one
was
more
incensed
at
this
than
the
knight
of
berg
this
knight
belonged
indeed
to
a
race
said
to
have
been
descended
from
an
archbishop
of
cologne
but
his
disposition
was
evil
and
his
covetousness
and
avarice
made
him
wish
to
increase
what
earthly
possessions
he
had
but
the
lord
of
rheinfels
was
shrewd
enough
and
hesitated
before
entrusting
his
pretty
daughter
and
her
large
dowry
to
such
a
man
as
already
remarked
this
entirely
agreed
with
the
maiden
desire
she
was
really
deeply
in
love
with
the
chivalrous
young
knight
of
rüdesheim
but
shrank
almost
with
aversion
from
the
impetuous
wooing
of
the
harsh
and
selfish
knight
of
berg
some
time
after
the
betrothal
of
the
lovers
the
date
of
the
marriage
was
fixed
before
the
marriage
had
been
celebrated
however
young
brömser
appeared
at
rüdesheim
in
the
early
dawn
on
his
steaming
having
ridden
during
the
night
from
rüdesheim
to
bring
the
following
sad
intelligence
to
his
beloved
the
emperor
albrecht
had
summoned
the
nobles
to
do
battle
against
the
swiss
confederates
who
had
renounced
their
allegiance
driven
the
imperial
representatives
from
their
land
and
finally
declared
war
against
their
overlord
the
knights
of
the
rhineland
were
called
upon
to
suppress
the
flames
of
rebellion
on
receiving
the
pressing
call
of
the
emperor
brömser
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
but
resolved
to
obey
his
feudal
superior
at
first
the
young
bride
wept
but
when
her
lover
comforted
her
with
words
of
endearment
and
her
father
praised
the
soldierly
resolution
of
the
young
man
the
maiden
calmly
submitted
to
the
will
of
god
before
the
young
knight
rode
off
he
took
a
young
which
he
had
pulled
up
in
a
grove
and
having
removed
the
soil
with
his
sword
he
planted
the
sapling
in
front
of
the
castle
then
he
spoke
as
follows
to
his
bride
tend
this
budding
linden
which
i
have
planted
here
to
the
honour
of
my
patron
saint
you
shall
keep
troth
with
me
so
long
as
it
flourishes
but
if
it
fade
and
may
george
in
his
grace
prevent
it
then
you
may
forget
me
for
i
shall
be
dead
the
weeping
bride
threw
herself
in
her
lover
arms
and
while
he
enfolded
her
gently
with
his
right
with
his
left
he
raised
his
sword
and
showed
her
engraved
upon
it
in
ancient
letters
for
daily
repetition
the
words
preserve
o
everlasting
god
the
body
here
the
soul
hereafter
help
knight
st
george
then
after
receiving
many
kind
wishes
from
his
sorrowing
friends
the
young
soldier
rode
in
the
morning
mist
down
through
the
woods
to
join
the
imperial
forces
several
months
passed
then
the
melancholy
news
got
abroad
in
the
german
land
that
something
disastrous
had
happened
in
the
campaign
against
the
swiss
peasants
at
last
came
a
trustworthy
report
to
the
effect
that
a
bloody
defeat
had
overtaken
the
proud
army
of
albrecht
it
was
at
morgarten
where
the
noble
hero
called
arnold
of
winkelried
had
opened
up
to
his
countrymen
a
pathway
to
freedom
over
his
spearpierced
body
many
counts
and
barons
found
on
that
day
a
grave
in
the
land
of
the
swiss
and
sounds
of
mourning
were
to
be
heard
in
many
a
german
castle
but
to
castle
rheinfels
no
traveller
brought
any
tidings
either
of
weal
or
woe
and
we
can
imagine
with
what
sickness
of
heart
the
maiden
waited
and
how
her
hope
faded
as
the
days
and
weeks
slipped
past
it
was
so
long
since
the
army
had
set
out
against
the
forest
cantons
and
now
the
thoughts
of
men
were
turned
in
other
directions
while
the
swiss
peasants
were
quietly
allowed
to
reap
the
fruits
of
their
bravery
the
most
sanguine
found
it
difficult
to
cheer
the
drooping
maiden
of
castle
rheinfels
then
one
day
her
former
wooer
the
mean
avaricious
dietrich
of
berg
presented
himself
it
was
certain
that
george
brömser
must
be
dead
and
he
was
come
again
to
sue
for
the
hand
of
so
desirable
a
young
lady
the
dejected
maiden
informed
her
eager
wooer
that
she
had
plighted
her
troth
to
her
absent
lover
beside
the
flourishing
in
front
of
the
castle
only
when
this
tree
consecrated
to
george
should
fade
would
she
be
released
from
her
promise
the
knight
of
berg
departed
in
anger
and
immediately
betook
himself
to
a
wood
and
there
selected
a
decayed
linden
as
similar
as
possible
to
the
green
one
growing
before
castle
rheinfels
in
the
night
he
cautiously
approached
the
castle
tore
up
the
linden
flung
it
with
a
curse
into
the
rhine
and
then
planted
in
its
place
the
withered
sapling
next
morning
a
morning
bright
with
the
promise
of
spring
the
fair
daughter
of
rheinfels
stepped
out
on
the
lawn
a
cry
of
pain
escaped
her
lips
when
she
perceived
the
faded
tree
the
days
and
weeks
that
followed
were
spent
in
deep
grief
after
a
suitable
time
had
elapsed
the
knight
of
berg
again
put
in
an
appearance
at
rheinfels
mightily
pleased
with
himself
again
he
sought
the
hand
of
the
maiden
now
released
from
her
solemn
promise
sadly
but
firmly
however
she
told
her
importunate
wooer
that
she
would
keep
troth
with
her
lover
in
death
as
in
life
then
the
wrath
of
the
despised
knight
drove
him
to
commit
a
horrible
deed
in
his
savage
anger
he
drew
his
sword
and
buried
it
in
the
maiden
breast
fleeing
from
the
scene
of
his
dreadful
crime
he
was
suddenly
seized
with
remorse
and
like
our
lord
avaricious
disciple
he
went
and
hanged
himself
deep
was
the
sorrow
in
castle
rheinfels
over
the
sacrifice
of
this
innocent
young
bride
who
had
kept
her
troth
so
nobly
but
grief
and
tears
could
not
replace
the
lost
one
in
the
midst
of
the
mourning
a
stranger
was
announced
he
came
from
the
swiss
land
after
the
battle
of
morgarten
a
brave
swiss
had
found
george
brömser
with
broken
limbs
and
many
bleeding
wounds
amongst
a
heap
of
slain
in
a
peasant
hut
the
wounded
man
lay
long
in
pain
and
weakness
his
broken
limbs
required
long
and
patient
attention
finally
after
much
suffering
george
brömser
the
last
of
all
the
campaigners
rode
back
to
the
rhineland
with
his
lover
name
on
his
lips
and
her
image
in
his
heart
with
uncovered
head
the
lord
of
rheinfels
showed
the
young
man
the
grave
of
his
beloved
and
there
the

and

george
brömser
did
not
a
second
time
fall
in
love
but
remained
true
to
his
chosen
bride
to
the
end
of
his
days
we
are
told
that
in
the
company
of
knightly
minstrels
he
sought
to
forget
his
great
sorrow
and
that
later
he
composed
many
pretty
songs
one
of
them
has
survived
the
centuries
and
was
recently
discovered
along
with
the
melody
in
an
old
manuscript
it
begins

in
yonder

ah
god
what

and

the
brothers
i
in
the
middle
ages
an
old
knight
belonging
to
the
court
of
the
emperor
conrad
ii
lived
in
a
castle
called
sternberg
near
boppard
the
old
warrior
had
two
sons
left
to
him
his
wife
had
died
many
years
before
and
since
her
death
merry
laughter
had
seldom
been
heard
in
the
halls
of
the
beautiful
castle
soon
a
ray
of
sunshine
seemed
to
break
into
these
solemn
rooms
a
distant
cousin
at
rüdesheim
had
died
leaving
his
only
child
a
beautiful
young
girl
to
the
care
of
his
relative
the
angela
became
the
pet
of
the
castle
and
won
the
affection
and
friendship
of
the
two
sons
by
her
engaging
ways
what
had
already
happened
hundred
of
times
now
happened
among
these
young
people
love
replaced
the
friendship
of
the
two
young
knights
and
both
tried
to
win
the
maiden
favour
the
old
master
of
the
castle
noticed
this
change
and
his
heart
forbode
trouble
both
sons
were
equally
dear
to
him
but
perhaps
his
who
had
inherited
his
mother
gentle
character
fulfilled
his
desire
more
than
the
fiery
spirit
of
conrad
the
younger
from
the
first
moment
when
the
orphan
appeared
at
his
family
seat
he
had
conceived
the
thought
that
his
favourite
son
henry
who
was
heir
to
his
name
and
estates
would
marry
the
maiden
henry
loved
angela
with
a
profound
sincere
feeling
which
he
seldom
expressed
his
brother
on
the
contrary
made
no
secret
of
his
ardent
love
and
soon
the
old
man
perceived
with
sorrow
that
the
beautiful
girl
returned
his
younger
son
passionate
love
henry
too
was
not
unaware
of
the
happiness
of
this
pair
and
in
generous
he
tried
to
bury
his
grief
and
to
rejoice
heartily
in
his
success
the
distress
of
the
elder
brother
did
not
escape
angela
she
was
much
moved
when
she
first
remarked
that
his
voice
trembled
on
pronouncing
her
name
but
soon
love
dazzled
her
eyes
so
that
the
clouds
on
his
troubled
countenance
passed
unnoticed
by
her
about
this
time
bernhard
of
clairvaux
came
from
france
to
the
rhine
preaching
a
second
crusade
against
the
infidels
the
fiery
words
of
the
saintly
monk
roused
many
thousands
to
action
his
appeal
likewise
reached
the
castle
of
sternberg
henry
though
not
envying
his
brother
happiness
felt
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
be
a
constant
witness
of
it
and
thus
he
was
glad
to
answer
this
call
and
to
take
up
the
cross
conrad
too
longing
for
action
and
dominated
by
the
impulse
of
the
moment
was
stirred
up
by
the
witching
charms
which
a
crusade
to
palestine
offered
his
adventurous
soul
cramped
up
in
this
castle
so
far
removed
from
the
world
thirsted
for
the
adventures
which
he
imagined
were
awaiting
the
crusaders
in
the
east
in
vain
the
tears
and
prayers
of
the
young
girl
were
shed
in
vain
was
the
sorrow
of
his
father
who
begged
him
not
to
desert
him
the
old
man
was
in
despair
about
the
unbending
resolutions
of
his
sons
who
will
remain
at
the
castle
of
my
forefathers
if
you
both
abandon
it
now
perhaps
never
to
return
cried
he
sorrowfully
i
implore
you
my
eldest
son
you
the
very
image
of
your
mother
to
have
pity
on
your
father
gray
hairs
and
you
conrad
have
pity
on
the
tears
of
your
betrothed
the
brothers
remained
silent
then
the
eldest
grasped
the
old
man
hand
saying
gently
i
shall
not
leave
you
my
father
and
you
angela
said
the
younger
to
the
weeping
maiden
you
will
try
and
bear
this
separation
and
will
plant
a
sprig
of
laurel
to
make
a
wreath
for
me
when
i
return
ii
the
next
day
the
young
knight
left
the
home
of
his
forefathers
at
first
the
maiden
seemed
inconsolable
in
her
grief
but
soon
her
love
began
to
slumber
like
a
tired
child
on
awakening
from
this
drowsiness
indignation
seized
her
whispering
complainingly
in
her
ear
and
disturbing
all
the
sweet
memories
in
which
the
picture
of
her
lover
gleamed
forth
he
who
had
parted
from
her
for
the
sake
of
empty
glory
now
left
to
herself
she
began
to
consider
the
proud
youth
who
was
forced
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
his
rejected
love
she
admired
his
good
qualities
which
all
seemed
to
have
escaped
her
before
his
great
daring
at
the
chase
his
skill
with
weapons
and
his
many
kind
acts
of
pure
friendship
to
her
with
the
view
of
sweetening
the
bitter
separation
from
which
she
was
suffering
he
seemed
afraid
of
rousing
the
love
which
was
still
sleeping
in
his
heart
in
the
meantime
angela
felt
herself
drawn
more
and
more
towards
the
knight
she
wished
to
try
and
make
him
understand
that
her
love
for
his
younger
brother
had
only
been
a
youthful
passion
which
seemed
to
have
flown
when
he
left
her
she
felt
unhappy
when
she
understood
that
henry
whom
she
now
began
really
to
love
seemed
to
feel
nothing
but
brotherly
affection
for
her
and
she
longed
in
her
inmost
soul
for
a
word
of
love
from
him
henry
was
not
unaware
of
this
change
in
her
affections
but
he
proudly
smothered
every
rising
thought
in
his
heart
for
his
betrothed
the
old
knight
was
greatly
pleased
when
one
day
angela
came
to
him
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
disclosed
to
him
the
secret
of
her
heart
he
prayed
god
fervently
to
bring
these
two
loving
hearts
together
whom
he
believed
were
destined
for
one
another
by
will
of
god
in
his
dreams
he
already
saw
angela
in
her
castle
like
his
dead
wife
and
his
son
rocking
her
little
baby
a
child
then
he
would
suddenly
recollect
his
impetuous
younger
son
fighting
in
the
crusades
and
his
dreams
would
be
hastily
interrupted
just
opposite
to
his
ancestral
hall
he
caused
a
proud
fort
to
be
built
and
called
it
liebenstein
intending
it
for
his
second
son
when
he
returned
from
the
holy
land
the
castle
was
hardly
finished
when
the
old
man
died
the
crusade
at
last
was
at
an
end
all
the
knights
from
the
rhine
country
brought
back
the
news
with
them
on
their
return
from
the
holy
land
that
conrad
had
married
a
beautiful
grecian
woman
in
the
east
and
was
now
on
his
way
home
with
her
henry
was
beside
himself
with
wrath
on
hearing
this
news
such
dishonourable
conduct
and
shameful
neglect
seemed
impossible
to
him
and
going
to
the
maiden
he
informed
her
of
his
brother
approaching
return
she
turned
very
pale
her
lips
moved
but
her
tongue
found
no
words
iii
a
large
ship
was
seen
one
day
sailing
along
the
rhine
with
strange
flags
waving
on
its
masts
angela
saw
it
from
her
tower
where
she
now
spent
many
a
long
day
reflecting
on
her
unfortunate
destiny
and
she
hastily
called
up
the
elder
brother
the
ship
approached
nearer
and
nearer
soon
the
cries
of
the
boatmen
could
be
heard
and
the
faces
of
the
crew
could
be
distinguished
suddenly
the
maiden
uttered
a
cry
and
threw
herself
weeping
into
the
arms
of
the
knight
the
latter
gazed
at
the
vessel
his
brows
contracted
yes
there
on
board
in
shining
armour
stood
his
brother
with
a
beautiful
strange
woman
clinging
to
his
arm
the
ship
touched
land
one
of
the
first
conrad
sprang
on
shore
the
two
watchers
in
the
tower
disappeared
a
man
approached
conrad
and
informed
him
that
the
new
castle
was
destined
for
him
the
same
day
the
impetuous
knight
sent
notice
of
his
arrival
to
sternberg
castle
but
his
brother
answered
him
that
he
would
wait
for
him
on
the
bridge
but
would
only
meet
sword
in
hand
the
faithless
lover
who
had
deserted
his
betrothed
twilight
was
creeping
over
the
two
castles
on
the
narrow
ground
separating
the
forts
the
brothers
strove
together
in
a
deadly
fight
they
were
equally
courageous
equally
strong
those
two
opponents
and
their
swords
crossed
swiftly
one
in
righteous
anger
the
other
in
wounded
pride
but
soon
the
elder
received
a
blow
and
the
blood
began
to
drop
on
his
breastplate
the
bushes
were
at
this
moment
suddenly
pushed
asunder
and
a
maiden
veiled
in
white
dashed
in
between
the
fighters
thrusting
them
from
each
other
it
was
angela
who
cried
out
in
a
despairing
voice
in
god
name
stop
and
for
your
father
sake
cease
ere
it
be
too
late
she
for
whom
you
have
drawn
your
swords
is
now
going
to
take
the
veil
and
will
beg
god
day
and
night
to
forgive
you
conrad
for
your
falseness
and
will
pray
him
to
bless
you
and
your
brother
for
ever
both
brothers
threw
down
their
arms
conrad
his
head
deeply
bowed
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
he
did
not
dare
to
look
at
the
maiden
who
stood
there
a
silent
reproach
to
him
henry
took
the
weeping
girl
hand
come
sister
said
he
such
faithlessness
does
not
deserve
your
tears
they
disappeared
among
the
trees
silently
conrad
stood
gazing
after
them
a
feeling
which
he
had
never
known
seemed
to
rise
up
in
his
heart
and
bending
his
head
he
wept
bitterly
iv
the
cloister
marienburg
lay
in
a
valley
at
some
distance
from
the
castles
and
there
angela
found
peace
a
wall
was
soon
built
up
between
the
two
forts
sternberg
and
liebenstein
a
silent
witness
of
the
enmity
between
the
two
brothers
banquet
followed
banquet
in
the
newly
built
castle
and
the
beautiful
grecian
won
great
triumphs
among
the
knights
of
the
rhine
but
sorrow
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
sternberg
castle
henry
had
not
wished
to
move
the
maiden
from
her
purpose
but
from
the
time
of
her
departure
his
strength
faded
away
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
he
caused
a
cloister
to
be
built
and
a
few
months
later
he
passed
away
from
this
world
just
on
the
same
day
that
the
bells
were
tolling
for
angela
death
the
lord
of
liebenstein
was
not
granted
a
lasting
happiness
with
his
beautiful
wife
she
fled
with
a
knight
who
had
long
enjoyed
the
lavish
hospitality
at
castle
liebenstein
conrad
overcome
by
sorrow
and
disgrace
threw
himself
from
a
pinnacle
of
the
castle
into
the
depths
below
the
strongholds
then
fell
into
the
hands
of
knight
brömser
of
rüdesheim
and
since
that
time
have
fallen
into
ruins
the
church
and
cloister
still
remain
in
the
valley
and
are
the
scene
of
many
a
pilgrimage
rhense
the
emperor
wenzel
in
the
middle
of
a
beautiful
meadow
at
rhense
near
coblenz
stands
the
famous
historical
king
chair
here
where
the
lands
of
the
three
great
prelates
of
cologne
mayence
and
treves
join
together
the
princely
seven
met
to
choose
the
new
ruler
who
was
to
direct
the
destiny
of
the
holy
roman
empire
here
charles
iv
was
chosen
by
the
free
will
of
the
electors
here
also
the
seven
elected
wenzeslaus
of
the
house
of
luxemburg
son
emperor
during
his
charles
had
exerted
himself
very
much
over
the
election
of
his
son
and
he
even
made
a
pilgrimage
with
him
to
rhense
on
the
rhine
where
at
the
renowned
königsstuhl
the
chancellor
of
the
kingdom
archbishop
of
mayence
often
held
important
conferences
with
their
graces
of
treves
and
cologne
and
the
count
palatine
this
wenzeslaus
of
bohemia
had
a
great
predilection
for
the
rhine
and
its
wines
and
later
on
when
less
by
his
own
merits
than
by
the
exertions
of
his
father
and
the
favour
of
the
electors
he
became
german
emperor
his
brother
inheriting
the
sandy
country
of
brandenburg
he
had
even
then
paid
more
honours
to
the
rhine
wine
than
any
other
of
its
lovers
it
afforded
him
a
greater
pleasure
than
the
enjoyment
of
wearing
a
crown
finding
that
a
good
drink
tasted
better
at
the
place
of
its
origin
he
often
visited
the
brave
count
palatine
of
the
rhine
who
dwelt
in
this
blissful
country
and
who
had
more
casks
in
his
cellar
than
there
are
saints
days
in
a
year
this
proof
of
imperial
confidence
was
by
no
means
disagreeable
to
the
very
noble
elector
ruprecht
of
the
palatinate
and
he
neglected
no
opportunity
of
striving
to
ingratiate
himself
more
and
more
in
the
emperor
favour
gallant
ruprecht
would
not
unwillingly
have
exchanged
his
little
palatinate
crown
for
an
imperial
one
sometimes
when
his
royal
guest
becoming
very
jovial
from
the
wine
he
had
taken
confessed
that
the
high
dignity
of
emperor
was
becoming
troublesome
to
him
the
count
agreed
with
him
frankly
and
never
failed
to
let
his
imperial
master
know
that
the
electors
were
discontented
at
his
careless
administration
and
would
be
well
pleased
if
he
retired
emperor
wenzel
listened
to
all
he
said
with
perfect
indifference
continuing
in
the
meantime
to
revel
in
his
wine
one
day
the
emperor
was
sitting
with
his
gay
companions
at
the
königsstuhl
in
rhense
they
were
all
very
merry
as
the
cup
of
assmannshäuser
wine
had
already
been
passed
round
many
times
this
delicious
vintage
was
very
pleasing
to
wenzel
and
the
other
drinkers
could
not
find
words
enough
to
praise
it
while
the
goblets
were
being
handed
round
and
sounds
of
joviality
filled
the
royal
hall
the
emperor
stood
up
suddenly
and
addressing
himself
to
the
count
said
in
a
very
tone
i
think
the
crown
which
was
set
on
my
head
would
not
be
very
unsuitable
to
you
well
i
offer
it
to
you
if
you
are
able
to
place
before
me
and
my
companions
here
a
wine
which
tastes
better
than
this
assmannshäuser
there
was
a
cunning
twinkle
in
the
count
eyes
as
he
beckoned
to
his
page
after
a
while
a
servant
rolled
in
a
great
cask
from
which
the
cups
were
at
once
filled
the
count
stood
up
and
presented
the
first
goblet
to
the
emperor
that
is
my
bacharacher
wine
noble
lords
taste
it
i
can
wait
for
your
judgment
without
fear
they
all
drank
and
every
face
beamed
with
pleasure
the
opinions
were
undivided
in
favour
of
the
fiery
bacharacher
the
emperor
rose
and
loudly
declared
he
preferred
it
to
the
assmannshäuser
he
could
not
praise
it
too
highly
nor
drink
enough
of
it
this
wine
is
worth
more
than
a
thousand
crowns
said
he
enthusiastically
wenzel
kept
his
word
and
ceded
his
crown
to
ruprecht
of
the
palatinate
who
in
his
turn
made
the
emperor
a
present
of
six
of
bacharacher
wine

the
opposite
side
of

somewhat
in
the

pentagon

to
the
hordes
of
louis
xiii
in
the
same
year
as
the
castle
of
heidelberg
was
destroyed
the
following
stirring
tale
is
associated
with
lahneck
it
was
the
templars
of
jerusalem
who
erected
this
fortress
whose
imposing
rises
nearly
feet
above
the
main
building
the
riches
of
the
templars
led
to
their
destruction
the
contemptible
french
king
philip
the
fair
by
making
grave
complaints
to
the
pope
obtained
an
order
for
the
abolition
of
this
order
and
dragged
the
grand
master
with
fifty
of
his
faithful
followers
to
the
stake
everywhere
a
cruel
policy
of
extermination
was
immediately
adopted
against
the
outlawed
knights
the
chief
motive
of
the
persecutors
being
rather
a
desire
to
confiscate
the
rich
possessions
of
the
templars
than
any
religious
zeal
against
heretics
and
sinners
peter
von
aspelt
archbishop
of
mainz
had
cast
envious
eyes
on
proud
lahneck
which
sheltered
twelve
and
their
retainers
alleging
some
faulty
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
soldiers
of
the
cross
he
gave
orders
that
the
castle
should
be
razed
and
that
the
knights
should
exchange
the
white
mantle
with
the
red
cross
for
the
cowl
but
to
this
the
twelve
as
knights
peur
et
sans
issued
a
stout
defiance
this
excited
the
greed
and
rage
of
the
archbishop
all
the
more
from
the
pontiff
whom
with
his
own
hands
he
had
successfully
nursed
on
his
at
avignon
peter
von
aspelt
procured
full
power
over
the
goods
and
lives
of
the
excommunicated
knights
of
lahneck
he
then
proceeded
down
the
rhine
with
many
vassals
and
mercenaries
and
presented
the
pope
letter
to
the
templars
at
the
same
time
commanding
them
to
yield
otherwise
their
castle
would
be
taken
by
storm
and
the
inmates
as
impenitent
sinners
would
die
a
shameful
death
on
the
gallows
the
oldest
of
the
twelve
a
man
with
silvery
hair
advanced
and
declared
in
the
name
of
his
brethren
that
they
were
resolved
to
fight
to
the
last
drop
of
their
blood
and
further
that
they
were
quite
prepared
to
suffer
like
their
brethren
in
france
and
so
the
fight
between
such
fearful
odds
began
many
soldiers
of
the
electorate
fell
under
the
swords
of
the
knights
and
their
faithful
servants
but
ever
the
furious
archbishop
ordered
forward
new
bands
to
fill
the
gaps
day
by
day
the
ranks
of
the
defenders
became
thinner
prominent
everywhere
in
this
hand
to
hand
struggle
were
the
heroic
forms
of
the
twelve
templars
in
white
mantle
with
cross
at
last
at
a
breach
which
had
been
defended
with
leonine
courage
one
of
the
noble
twelve
sank
beneath
his
shattered
shield
and
closed
his
eyes
in
death
a
second
shared
his
fate
then
a
third
the
others
bleeding
from
many
wounds
and
aided
by
the
sorely
diminished
remnant
of
their
retainers
redoubled
their
brave
efforts
but
still
death
made
havoc
in
their
ranks
when
on
the
evening
of
the
day
of
fiercest
onslaught
the
victorious
besiegers
planted
their
banner
on
the
captured
battlement
the
veteran
the
former
spokesman
stood
with
sword
among
the
bodies
of
his
fallen
comrades
the
last
survivor
touched
by
such
noble
heroism
the
archbishop
informed
him
that
he
would
be
allowed
to
surrender
but
calling
down
the
curse
of
heaven
on
worldly
churchmen
and
their
greed
of
land
he
raised
on
high
his
sword
and
rushed
upon
his
foes
pierced
with
many
wounds
the
last
of
the
twelve
sank
to
the
earth
and
over
the
corpse
of
this
noble
man
the
soldiers
of
mainz
pressed
into
the
fortress
itself
peter
von
aspelt
preserved
lahneck
as
a
place
of
defence
and
residence
for

the

remained
in
the
possession
of
the
electorate
of
mainz
for
years
but
the
sad
story
of
the
twelve
heroic
templars
is
remembered
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lahneck
to
this
day
coblenz
riza
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
century
when
the
pious
ludwig
son
of
charlemagne
was
struggling
with
his
misguided
children
for
the
imperial
crown
a
church
was
built
in
coblenz
to
castor
the
missionary
who
had
spread
christianity
in
the
valley
of
the
moselle
the
edifice
arose
on
a
branch
of
the
rhine
the
palace
of
the
frankish
king
stood
at
this
time
on
the
highest
point
of
coblenz
on
the
site
of
a
former
roman
fort
and
near
by
was
a
nunnery
dedicated
to
castor
in
this
building
lived
riza
a
daughter
of
ludwig
the
pious
who
had
early
dedicated
her
life
to
the
church
every
day
this
king
daughter
went
to
mass
in
the
castor
church
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
rhine
so
great
grace
had
riza
found
in
the
sight
of
our
lord
that
like
his
disciple
of
old
on
the
sea
of
genesareth
she
walked
over
the
rhine
to
the
holy
sacrament
in
castor
one
day
the
sacred
legend
goes
on
to
say
the
stream
was
agitated
by
a
storm
for
the
first
time
doubt
entered
the
maiden
heart
as
her
foot
touched
the
waves
prudently
tearing
a
prop
from
a
neighbouring
vineyard
she
took
it
with
her
for
a
staff
over
the
troubled
waters
but
after
a
few
timid
steps
she
sank
like
peter
on
the
galilean
lake
in
this
wretched
plight
she
became
full
of
remorse
for
her
want
of
faith
in
god
she
flung
the
stick
far
away
and
lifting
her
arms
towards
heaven
committed
herself
to
the
sole
protection
of
the
almighty
at
once
she
rose
up
from
the
waves
and
arrived
with
dry
feet
as
heretofore
on
the
other
side
more
than
ever
after
this
did
riza
this
saintly
daughter
of
a
saintly
king
strive
to
excel
in
those
works
which
are
pleasing
to
god
she
died
within
the
cloister
and
her
bones
were
laid
in
the
castor
church
near
the
of
the
saint
soon
the
popular
imagination
canonised
riza
and
her
marble
tomb
is
still
to
be
seen
in
the
north
transept
of
the
castor
church
at
coblenz
valley
of
the
moselle
the
doctor
wine
of
bernkastel
the
wine
of
bernkastel
is
called
doctor
wine
or
even
shorter
still
doctor
and
it
has
been
known
by
this
singular
name
for
more
than
five
hundred
years
about
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
bishop
bohemund
lay
ill
of
a
very
violent
fever
at
bernkastel
the
worthy
man
was
obliged
to
swallow
many
a
bitter
pill
and
many
a
sour
drink
but
all
without
avail
the
poor
divine
began
at
last
to
fear
the
worst
despite
his
high
calling
and
his
earnest
search
after
holy
things
his
bishopric
on
the
lovely
moselle
pleased
him
better
than
any
seat
in
heaven
he
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
his
diocese
that
whoever
should
be
able
to
cure
him
of
this
terrible
fever
be
he
layman
or
learned
doctor
should
receive
his
pastoral
blessing
and
a
rich
present
into
the
bargain
at
that
very
time
a
brave
old
warrior
lived
at
treves
who
heard
about
the
suffering
bishop
and
had
pity
on
him
in
his
great
need
moreover
this
veteran
whose
name
has
not
come
down
to
posterity
was
very
much
indebted
to
the
bishop
for
once
many
years
before
bohemund
had
saved
him
from
the
hands
of
the
enemy
in
a
skirmish
near
sponheim
the
noble
old
soldier
was
much
distressed
to
hear
that
the
holy
man
was
suffering
so
terribly
he
remembered
too
that
once
he
himself
had
been
attacked
by
violent
fever
and
had
fought
hard
with
death
and
that
his
friends
had
talked
about
pills
and
certain
bitter
drinks
but
he
had
sent
them
all
away
and
had
called
his
servant
desiring
him
to
bring
him
a
good
bowl
of
fiery
bernkastler
wine
when
he
had
taken
a
hearty
drink
no
small
matter
for
one
lying
ill
of
fever
he
awoke
out
of
a
deep
sleep
twelve
hours
later
the
fever
completely
gone
why
should
not
this
same
bernkastler
cure
thought
he
have
the
same
effect
on
the
worthy
prelate
after
considering
for
a
time
the
old
knight
set
out
quite
alone
from
his
castle
in
the
forest
of
soon
to
visit
his
spiritual
benefactor
taking
only
a
little
cask
with
him
bohemund
lying
on
his
sick
bed
is
said
to
have
cast
a
very
suspicious
look
at
the
good
man
who
stated
that
he
could
cure
him
but
who
carried
all
his
medicines
and
mixtures
in
a
little
cask
on
his
shoulder
the
knight
however
making
a
sign
to
the
officious
servants
and
attendants
to
leave
the
chamber
informed
the
reverend
gentleman
of
what
he
was
about
to
do
he
then
calmly
took
the
plug
out
of
the
cask
and
gave
the
sick
man
a
drink
of
the
sparkling
wine
which
he
had
brought
with
him
the
bishop
readily
swallowed
the
wine
at
one
draught
another
was
administered
to
him
soon
after
and
the
eminent
prelate
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
the
next
day
the
people
of
treves
heard
with
great
joy
that
the
fever
had
completely
disappeared
the
bishop
on
awaking
took
another
stout
draught
and
sang
out
of
the
depths
of
his
grateful
heart
this
famous
wine
restored
my
health

andernach
genovefa
i
in
all
the
rhine
provinces
the
virtuous
spouse
of
count
siegfried
of
the
palatinate
was
esteemed
and
venerated
the
people
called
her
genovefa
which
name
indeed
she
was
worthy
of
as
she
suffered
cruel
trials
and
sorrows
siegfried
castle
stood
near
the
old
town
of
andernach
just
at
the
time
when
charles
martel
was
reigning
over
the
franks
siegfried
and
his
young
wife
lived
in
peaceful
unity
till
a
cloud
came
over
their
happiness
the
arabs
from
spain
had
forced
their
way
into
gaul
and
were
now
marching
northwards
burning
and
destroying
all
on
their
course
the
enemies
of
the
cross
must
be
repulsed
unless
the
west
was
to
share
the
fate
of
africa
which
had
been
subdued
by
the
mohametans
the
reached
the
palatinate
and
siegfried
had
to
go
forth
to
the
fight
equipped
in
his
armour
and
having
kissed
his
weeping
wife
he
bade
farewell
to
the
castle
of
his
fathers
but
he
was
sad
at
heart
at
leaving
the
spot
where
the
happiest
days
of
his
life
had
been
spent
he
entrusted
the
administration
of
his
property
to
golo
his
steward
and
recommended
his
beloved
wife
very
earnestly
to
his
protection
begging
her
in
turn
to
trust
him
in
everything
the
poor
countess
was
at
this
bitter
separation
she
felt
the
loneliness
of
the
castle
deeply
she
longed
for
his
happy
presence
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
could
never
speak
to
golo
as
to
the
friend
to
whose
care
her
husband
had
recommended
her
her
pure
eyes
shrank
from
the
passionate
look
which
gleamed
in
his
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
followed
her
every
movement
with
a
look
which
her
childlike
soul
did
not
understand
she
missed
her
husband
presence
more
and
more
she
would
go
out
on
the
balcony
and
weave
golden
dreams
and
while
she
sat
there
looking
out
over
the
hazy
blue
distance
she
longed
for
the
moment
when
siegfried
would
return
when
she
could
lean
her
head
upon
his
breast
and
tell
him
of
the
great
happiness
in
store
for
them
perhaps
the
war
against
the
heathens
might
last
so
long
that
she
would
be
able
to
hold
the
pledge
of
their
love
joyfully
out
to
him
from
the
balcony
on
his
return
and
the
countess
lovely
face
would
be
lit
up
with
a
gleam
of
blissful
happiness
and
she
would
while
away
the
time
on
her
favourite
spot
dreaming
and
looking
out
into
the
hazy
blue
distance
the
secret
aversion
which
the
countess
felt
towards
the
steward
was
not
without
a
reason
her
beauty
had
awakened
lustful
passion
in
golo
breast
which
he
did
not
strive
to
hide
on
the
contrary
his
frequent
intercourse
with
her
who
was
as
gracious
to
him
as
to
all
her
other
inferiors
stirred
his
passion
still
more
and
one
day
losing
all
control
he
threw
himself
at
the
countess
feet
declaring
his
love
for
her
and
imploring
her
to
return
it
genovefa
was
horrified
at
this
confession
with
indignation
and
scorn
she
rejected
his
love
forbidding
him
to
appear
before
her
as
he
had
utterly
forgotten
his
duty
and
at
the
same
time
threatening
to
complain
of
him
to
her
husband
golo
eyes
flared
up
and
a
deadly
look
of
hatred
gleamed
from
them
he
could
hope
for
no
pardon
from
his
angry
mistress
besides
his
pride
would
not
allow
him
to
seek
it
and
now
his
one
desire
was
revenge
it
only
remained
for
him
to
follow
his
dastardly
plan
and
to
avoid
siegfried
wrath
hatred
raged
in
his
breast
he
dismissed
all
the
servants
of
the
castle
and
put
new
ones
of
his
own
creation
in
their
places
then
one
day
he
appeared
before
the
horrified
countess
and
openly
accused
her
of
being
unfaithful
to
her
husband
far
away
shame
and
wrath
robbed
genovefa
of
speech
golo
explained
to
the
servants
who
were
standing
around
in
silent
amazement
that
he
had
already
informed
the
count
of
his
wife
faithless
conduct
and
that
he
golo
as
present
administrator
of
the
castle
now
condemned
the
countess
to
be
imprisoned
in
the
dungeon
the
unhappy
genovefa
awakened
to
find
herself
in
an
underground
cell
of
the
castle
she
covered
her
face
in
deep
sorrow
imploring
him
who
had
sent
her
this
trial
to
help
her
in
her
present
affliction
there
after
some
time
a
son
was
born
to
her
she
baptized
him
with
her
tears
giving
him
the
name
of
tristan
which
means
full
of
sorrows
ii
siegfried
had
already
been
absent
six
months
he
had
fought
like
a
hero
in
many
a
desperate
battle
the
fanatical
followers
of
mohamet
having
crossed
the
pyrenees
struggled
with
wild
enthusiasm
hoping
to
subdue
the
rest
of
western
europe
to
the
doctrines
of
islam
by
fire
and
sword
in
several
encounters
the
franks
had
been
obliged
to
give
way
to
their
power
these
unbridled
hordes
had
already
penetrated
into
the
heart
of
gaul
when
charles
first
appeared
and
engaged
the
arabs
in
the
bloody
battle
of
tours
from
morning
till
evening
the
struggle
on
which
hung
the
fate
of
europe
raged
and
there
charles
proved
himself
worthy
of
the
name
of
martel
the
hammer
which
he
afterwards
received
siegfried
fought
at
the
leader
side
like
a
lion
but
towards
evening
a
saracen
lance
pierced
him
and
though
the
wound
was
not
mortal
yet
he
was
obliged
to
remain
inactive
for
several
months
on
a
where
he
thought
with
longing
in
his
heart
of
his
loving
wife
by
the
rhine
a
messenger
arrived
one
day
at
the
camp
bearing
a
parchment
from
golo
siegfried
steward
the
count
gazed
long
at
the
fateful
letter
trying
to
comprehend
its
meaning
what
he
had
read
ran
thus
your
wife
is
unfaithful
to
you
and
has
betrayed
you
for
the
sake
of
drago
a
servant
who
ran
away
the
hero
crushed
the
letter
furiously
in
his
hand
a
groan
escaping
from
his
white
lips
then
he
started
off
accompanied
by
a
few
followers
and
rode
towards
the
ardennes
never
stopping
till
he
reached
his
own
fort
a
man
stood
on
the
balcony
looking
searchingly
out
into
the
distance
and
seeing
a
cloud
of
dust
approaching
in
which
a
group
of
horsemen
soon
became
visible
his
eyes
gleamed
triumphantly
a
stately
knight
advanced
his
charger
stamping
threateningly
on
the
drawbridge
golo
with
hypocritical
emotion
stood
before
the
count
who
had
now
alighted
from
his
foaming
horse
and
informed
him
again
of
what
had
happened
where
is
the
who
has
stained
the
honour
of
my
house
where
is
he
that
i
may
crush
his
life
out
cried
siegfried
in
a
fury
my
lord
i
have
punished
the
wretch
deservedly
and
lashed
him
out
of
the
castle
answered
golo
in
a
stern
voice
sighing
deeply
the
count
made
a
sign
to
golo
whose
false
eyes
gleamed
with
devilish
joy
to
lead
the
way
siegfried
entered
the
dungeon
followed
by
his
servants
and
also
by
those
who
had
travelled
with
him
genovefa
listened
breathlessly
in
her
prison
with
a
loved
name
trembling
on
her
lips
and
a
prayer
to
god
in
her
heart
now
the
terrible
trial
would
come
to
an
end
now
she
would
leave
this
dungeon
of
disgrace
triumphantly
and
exchange
the
crown
of
thorns
for
the
victor
wreath
the
bolt
was
unfastened
firm
steps
and
men
voices
were
heard
the
iron
doors
were
dashed
open
she
snatched
her
slumbering
child
the
pledge
of
their
love
and
held
it
towards
her
dear
husband
his
name
was
on
her
lips
but
before
she
could
utter
it
a
cry
of
agony
escaped
her
he
had
cast
her
from
him
and
his
accusations
falling
like
blows
from
a
hammer
on
her
head
the
poor
innocent
countess
fell
senseless
to
the
ground
the
next
day
two
servants
led
mother
and
child
out
into
the
forest
where
with
their
own
hands
they
were
to
kill
her
who
had
been
so
unfaithful
to
her
husband
and
her
child
also
they
were
to
bring
back
two
tongues
to
the
count
as
a
proof
that
they
had
obeyed
his
orders
the
servants
drove
them
into
the
wildest
depths
of
the
forest
where
only
the
screams
of
birds
of
prey
broke
the
silence
they
drew
their
knives
but
the
poor
countess
fell
on
her
knees
and
holding
up
her
little
child
implored
them
to
spare
their
lives
if
not
for
her
sake
at
least
for
the
sake
of
the
helpless
child
pity
entered
the
two
men
hearts
and
withheld
their
hands
dragging
the
mother
and
child
still
deeper
into
the
forest
they
turned
away
hastily
leaving
their
victims
to
themselves
they
brought
two
harts
tongues
to
the
count
informing
him
that
they
had
fulfilled
his
orders
iii
genovefa
tired
feet
wandered
through
the
unknown
forest
her
child
crying
with
hunger
she
prayed
fervently
to
heaven
in
her
despair
and
tears
were
sent
to
relieve
the
dull
pain
in
her
heart
after
which
she
felt
more
composed
and
her
child
was
soon
sweetly
slumbering
to
her
great
astonishment
she
perceived
a
cavern
near
her
where
she
could
take
shelter
and
as
if
god
wished
to
show
that
he
had
heard
her
prayer
a
white
doe
came
towards
the
cavern
rubbing
herself
caressingly
against
the
abandoned
woman
willingly
the
gentle
animal
allowed
the
little
child
to
suckle
it
the
next
day
the
doe
came
back
again
and
genovefa
thanked
god
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
she
found
roots
berries
and
plants
to
support
herself
and
every
day
the
tame
doe
came
back
to
her
and
at
last
remained
always
with
her
days
weeks
and
months
passed
her
unfaltering
faith
had
rendered
her
agony
less
in
time
she
learned
to
forgive
her
husband
who
had
condemned
her
unjustly
and
she
even
pardoned
him
who
had
taken
such
bitter
revenge
on
her
her
lovely
cheeks
had
become
thinner
but
the
forest
winds
had
breathed
a
soft
red
into
them
and
the
child
who
had
no
cares
nor
gnawing
pain
in
its
heart
grew
into
a
beautiful
little
boy
iv
at
the
castle
on
the
rhine
sorrow
was
a
constant
guest
since
this
terrible
event
had
happened
siegfried
burning
anger
had
sunk
into
sorrow
and
often
when
he
was
wandering
restlessly
through
the
rooms
so
rich
in
sweet
memories
where
now
a
deserted
stillness
reigned
the
agony
awoke
again
in
his
heart
he
now
repented
of
his
hastiness
and
a
voice
whispered
in
his
ear
that
he
had
been
too
severe
in
his
cruel
punishment
that
he
had
condemned
too
quickly
and
that
he
should
have
considered
what
he
could
have
done
to
mitigate
her
punishment
when
these
haunting
voices
pursued
him
he
would
hurry
away
from
the
castle
and
its
loneliness
not
being
able
to
bear
the
torment
of
his
thoughts
then
to
forget
his
trouble
he
would
follow
the
chase
with
the
yelping
hounds
but
he
only
seldom
succeeded
in
dulling
his
misery
everywhere
he
seemed
to
see
the
pale
face
of
a
woman
looking
imploringly
at
him
the
state
of
his
master
soul
had
not
escaped
golo
and
this
crafty
man
cringed
the
more
to
the
sorrowful
count
feigning
to
care
for
his
welfare
a
starving
person
accepts
even
the
bread
which
a
offers
and
siegfried
supposing
his
steward
wished
to
compensate
him
for
his
loss
accepted
willingly
every
proof
of
devotion
and
recompensed
him
with
his
favour
at
the
same
time
hating
the
man
in
his
inmost
soul
who
had
rendered
him
such
a
terrible
service
one
day
the
count
rode
out
to
the
chase
accompanied
by
only
a
few
retainers
one
of
whom
was
golo
siegfried
pressed
deeper
than
was
his
custom
into
the
forest
a
milkwhite
doe
sprang
up
before
him
and
sportsmanlike
he
chased
this
singular
animal
through
the
bushes
hoping
to
shoot
it
his
spear
had
just
grazed
it
when
it
disappeared
suddenly
into
a
cavern
a
woman
whose
ragged
garments
scarcely
covered
her
nakedness
leading
a
little
boy
by
the
hand
suddenly
came
out
of
the
opening
in
the
rock
and
the
doe
seeking
protection
rubbed
herself
against
her
she
looked
at
the
hunter
but
her
limbs
trembled
so
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
only
her
large
sad
eyes
gazed
wistfully
at
him
a
stifled
cry
half
triumphant
half
a
groan
escaped
from
her
lips
and
she
threw
herself
at
the
count
feet
from
the
voice
which
for
long
months
had
only
moved
in
earnest
prayer
or
in
low
sweet
words
to
the
child
now
flowed
solemn
protestations
of
her
innocence
her
words
burned
like
fire
into
the
soul
of
the
count
and
drawing
her
to
his
breast
he
kissed
her
tears
and
then
sank
at
her
feet
imploring
her
pardon
he
pressed
his
little
boy
to
his
heart
overcome
with
gratitude
and
happiness
and
wept
with
joy
calling
him
by
a
thousand
affectionate
names
then
at
the
sound
of
his
his
retinue
hastened
towards
him
golo
among
them
do
you
know
these
two
thundered
out
the
count
to
the
latter
tearing
him
from
the
throng
and
conducting
him
to
genovefa
the
wretch
as
if
struck
by
a
club
broke
down
and
clasping
his
master
knees
he
confessed
his
wickedness
and
begged
for
mercy
siegfried
thrust
him
contemptuously
from
him
refusing
sternly
in
spite
of
the
countess
intercession
to
pardon
his
crime
golo
was
bound
and
led
away
and
a
disgraceful
death
was
his
reward
now
began
a
time
of
great
happiness
for
siegfried
and
his
wife
and
they
lived
in
undisturbed
peace
with
their
little
son
in
gratitude
to
heaven
siegfried
caused
a
church
to
be
built
on
the
spot
where
the
white
doe
had
appeared
to
him
first
the
countess
often
made
a
pilgrimage
to
this
house
of
god
to
thank
him
who
had
caused
her
tears
to
be
turned
into
joy
then
a
day
came
when
her
corpse
was
carried
into
the
forest
and
was
buried
in
the
church
even
now
in
laach
the
wanderer
is
shown
the
church
and
the
tombstone
also
the
cavern
where
she
suffered
so
much

the
name
of

last
to
all
time

fortress

for
a
thousand
years
the
storms

beat
on
those
desolate
walls
one
of
the
first
owners
was
wolf
von
hammerstein
a
faithful
vassal
of
the
emperor
it
was
henry
iv
who
then
ruled
and
partly
by
his
own
faults
partly
by
those
of
others
the
crown
had
indeed
become
to
this
sovereign
one
of
thorns
wolf
of
hammerstein
had
made
the
historic
pilgrimage
to
canossa
alone
with
his
master
now
on
account
of
the
infirmities
of
age
the
venerable
knight
seldom
descended
the
and
only
from
afar
the
loud
trumpet
call
of
the
world
fell
upon
his
ears
his
wife
now
for
several
years
deceased
had
born
him
six
daughters
all
attractive
maidens
and
tenderly
attached
to
their
surviving
parent
but
their
filial
affection
met
with
the
roughest
and
most
ungrateful
responses
from
the
sour
old
fellow
it
was
a
sore
grievance
to
wolf
of
hammerstein
that
he
had
no
son
he
would
willingly
have
exchanged
his
halfdozen
daughters
for
a
single
male
heir
the
girls
were
only
too
well
aware
of
this
fact
and
tried
all
the
more
by
constant
love
and
tender
care
to
reconcile
their
ungracious
parent
to
his
lot
one
evening
it
thus
befell
the
autumn
wind
grumbled
round
the
castle
like
a
croaking
raven
and
the
old
knight
wolf
of
hammerstein
sat
by
a
cheerful
fire
and
peevishly
nursed
his
gouty
limbs
in
spite
of
the
most
assiduous
attentions
of
his
daughters
he
remained
in
a
most
surly
mood
the
pretty
maidens
however
kept
hovering
round
the
old
fellow
like
so
many
tender
doves
then
the
porter
announced
two
strangers
both
were
wrapped
in
their
knightly
mantles
and
in
spite
of
his
troubles
the
hospitable
lord
of
the
castle
prepared
to
welcome
his
guests
into
the
comfortable
room
two
shivering
and
weary
travellers
advanced
and
as
outlaws
they
craved
shelter
and
protection
for
the
night
at
the
sound
of
one
of
the
voices
the
knight
started
up
listening
eagerly
and
when
the
stranger
raised
his
visor
and
threw
back
his
mantle
wolf
of
hammerstein
sank
on
his
knees
at
the
stranger
feet
and
seizing
his
hand
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
exclaiming
henry
my
lord
and
king
then
with
trembling
voice
the
emperor
told
his
old
that
he
was
a
fugitive
and
before
one
who
had
torn
from
him
the
imperial
crown
and
mantle
and
when
the
old
knight
trembling
with
excitement
demanded
who
this
impious
and
dishonourable
man
might
be
the
emperor
murmured
the
words
my
son
and
then
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
rigid
as
a
marble
statue
stood
the
old
knight
like
a
bolt
from
heaven
the
consciousness
of
his
past
ignoble
conduct
had
flashed
upon
him
suddenly
he
seemed
to
feel
how
tenderly
the
loving
arms
of
his
daughters
had
enfolded
him
he
spread
out
his
hands
towards
them
as
if
anxious
to
atone
by
the
tenderness
of
a
minute
for
the
harshness
of
years
then
the
emperor
deeply
touched
thus
addressed
the
old
man
dear
your
position
is
indeed
enviable
the
faithful
love
of
your
daughters
will
tend
you
in
your
declining
years
no
misguided
son
impatient
for
your
end
will
hunt
you
from
your
home
alas
for
me
accompanied
by
a
few
faithful
followers
i
must
go
down
to
battle
against
my
own
flesh
and
blood
towards
midnight
the
unhappy
monarch
was
conducted
to
a
room
prepared
with
care
for
his
reception
and
while
he
sank
into
a
troubled
sleep
the
old
knight
overwhelmed
his
daughters
with
caresses
in
his
heart
he
silently
entreated
for
pardon
for
the
deep
grudge
he
had
long
cherished
against
the
god
who
had
been
pleased
to
grant
him
no
son
three
months
had
passed
by
sad
news
came
to
the
rhine
from
the
netherlands
the
emperor
henry
was
dead
in
the
midst
of
fresh
warlike
preparations
death
claimed
him
his
faithful
partisans
were
therefore
greatly
grieved
and
more
especially
wolf
of
hammerstein
but
the
second
part
of
the
tidings
made
him
even
sadder
the
consecrated
earth
was
denied
to
the
unfortunate
dead
emperor
his
coffin
was
placed
in
a
cellar
in
liege
without
any
respect
whoever
wished
could
go
there
to
slander
or
to
pray
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
whenever
they
desired
when
the
knight
was
told
of
this
he
swore
vehemently
and
did
not
close
his
eyes
for
several
nights
then
his
mind
was
made
up
all
the
prayers
and
weeping
of
the
daughters
did
not
make
him
alter
his
decision
one
day
he
stood
before
the
archbishop
of
cologne
and
reminded
him
how
he
had
saved
his
life
more
than
twenty
years
ago
and
he
recalled
to
his
memory
that
he
had
promised
to
grant
any
wish
of
the
hammersteins
there
was
a
great
discussion
between
the
knight
and
the
bishop
but
the
fidelity
of
the
vassal
was
rewarded
the
strong
ecclesiastical
protection
of
the
church
at
cologne
facilitated
the
steps
to
the
priests
in
liege
surrounded
by
pious
women
and
earnest
men
he
knelt
a
week
later
before
the
sarcophagus
he
pressed
his
lips
to
it
and
murmured
henry
my
master
and
my
king
afterwards
he
had
the
body
transferred
to
speyer
where
it
was
placed
in
the
royal
tomb
when
the
mournful
vessel
went
up
the
rhine
from
cologne
by
order
of
the
knight
black
flags
fluttered
in
the
wind

faithful

only
a
few
mouldering
ruins
now
show
where
one
of
the
proudest
strongholds
of
the
rhine
country
castle
altenahr
once
stood
a
legend
relates
the
mournful
story
of
the
last
of
the
race
which
had
lived
there
for
centuries
this
man
was
a
very
stubborn
knight
and
he
would
not
bow
down
to
or
even
acknowledge
the
archbishop
whom
his
majesty
the
emperor
had
sent
into
the
rhine
country
as
protector
of
the
church
unfortunately
the
bishop
was
also
of
a
proud
and
unyielding
character
and
he
nursed
resentment
in
his
heart
against
this
spurner
of
his
authority
it
was
not
long
before
his
smouldering
rancour
blazed
into
an
open
feud
and
the
mighty
bishop
accompanied
by
a
large
band
of
followers
appeared
before
the
proud
castle
of
altenahr
a
ring
of
iron
was
formed
round
the
offending
vassal
hold
but
its
owner
was
not
disturbed
by
this
formidable
array
and
only
laughed
sneeringly
at
the
besiegers
useless
trouble
knowing
well
that
they
would
never
be
able
to
storm
his
rocky
stronghold
the
warlike
priest
saw
many
of
his
little
army
bleeding
to
death
in
vain
he
was
very
wrathful
but
nevertheless
undismayed
he
had
sworn
a
great
oath
that
he
would
enter
this
invincible
hold
as
a
conqueror
even
if
the
fight
were
to
last
till
the
judgment
day
the
lord
of
altenahr
had
sworn
a
similar
oath
and
these
two
powerful
foes
were
well
matched
thus
the
siege
continued
for
some
months
the
besieger
anger
grew
hotter
for
every
attack
cost
him
the
lives
of
numbers
of
his
followers
and
all
his
efforts
seemed
useless
already
there
was
an
outburst
of
discontent
in
his
camp
many
servants
and
vassals
deserted
from
such
a
dangerous
venture
revolt
and
disobedience
seemed
on
one
occasion
to
threaten
a
complete
dissolution
of
the
besieging
army
as
a
desperate
attack
had
been
again
repulsed
by
the
hidden
inhabitants
of
the
fort
the
bishop
allies
urged
the
unrelenting
man
to
desist
from
his
merciless
purpose
but
he
received
their
protests
with
a
sneer
when
you
leave
me
my
greater
ally
hunger
will
draw
near
it
will
come
that
i
am
sure
of
then
followed
an
uproar
of
confused
voices

now
become

the

they
had
taken

to
brawling
with
their
leader

away
wait
my
men
just
wait
for
one
more
attack
he
cried
in
a
powerful
voice
it
will
be
the
fiercest
and
the
last
and
with
a
dark
face
he
turned
and
strode
away
dawn
was
creeping
over
the
valley
of
the
ahr
there
was
a
great
stir
in
the
camp
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
up
above
in
the
castle
of
altenahr
silence
reigned
round
hazy
pinnacles
suddenly
a
flourish
of
trumpets
was
heard
and
the
drawbridge
having
been
let
down
the
lord
of
the
castle
galloped
forth
on
a
milkwhite
charger
his
tall
figure
towering
over
the
animal
the
feather
of
his
helmet
waving
above
his
grey
hair
and
the
first
rays
of
the
rising
sun
irradiating
his
steel
armour
holding
his
steed
with
a
firm
grip
he
raised
his
right
hand
to
the
shouting
besiegers
signifying
that
he
wished
to
speak
his
voice
sounded
far
and
wide
see
here
the
last
man
and
the
last
charger
of
all
those
who
lived
in
my
tower
hunger
has
snatched
them
all
from
me
wife
child
comrades
they
all
preferred
death
to
slavery
i
follow
them
unvanquished
and
free
to
the
last
the
noble
animal
reared
up
at
the
spur
of
its
rider
a
great
spring
followed
by
a
thundering
crash
then
the
ahr
closed
her
foaming
waters
over
man
and
steed
a
shudder
seized
those
who
were
looking
on
the
dark
countenance
of
their
leader
became
pale
as
death
and
he
rode
off
without
a
delay
followed
by
the
curses
of
his
mutinous
troops
since
that
time
the
castle
of
altenahr
has
remained
deserted
no
one
dared
to
enter
the
chambers
hallowed
by
the
memory
of
this
heroic
defence
thus
it
was
avoided
by
mankind
till
time
gnawed
at
its
walls
and
destroyed
its
battlements
the
minstrel
of
neuenahr
i
he
was
called
ronald
this
tall
handsome
man
with
blue
eyes
and
fair
hair
he
had
a
noble
bearing
and
was
a
master
of
song
the
knight
at
the
castle
of
neuenahr
had
made
a
great
feast
and
ronald
was
sitting
on
the
drawbridge
playing
his
harp
and
singing
the
guests
stopped
their
noisy
conversation
within
doors
and
knights
as
well
as
noble
ladies
listened
breathless
to
the
unseen
singer
the
proud
lord
of
the
castle
bade
his
page
bring
the
traveller
in
thus
the
tall
handsome
man
the
blue
eyed
stranger
with
the
noble
bearing
appeared
before
the
high
company
the
knights
looked
at
him
with
wonder
and
many
a
handsome
lady
regarded
him
with
admiration
covertly
among
the
high
company
there
was
a
beautiful
young
girl
the
daughter
of
the
knight
whose
birthday
was
being
celebrated
the
lord
of
the
castle
rose
from
his
richly
carved
stool
and
made
a
sign
to
the
singer
who
was
bowing
graciously
to
the
knights
and
ladies
and
lower
still
to
the
master
of
the
castle
give
us
a
song
musician
in
honour
of
our
child
who
is
seventeen
years
old
the
musician
fixed
his
glance
in
silent
admiration
on
the
maiden
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
a
lovely
blush
covered
her
cheeks
he
seized
his
harp
and
after
a
few
chords
began
to
sing
a
song
of
homage
sweetly
sounded
the
music
and
even
sweeter
the
flattering
words
the
maiden
flushed
a
deeper
crimson
and
cast
down
her
eyes
once
when
the
harper
in
his
song
compared
her
to
a
star
lighting
a
wanderer
path
she
glanced
up
and
their
eyes
met
but
hers
sank
quickly
again
she
seemed
to
waken
out
of
a
dream
when
the
song
ended
amid
loud
applause
she
saw
her
father
lifting
up
a
massive
goblet
and
handing
it
to
the
singer
saw
how
the
latter
raised
it
first
to
her
afterwards
to
her
father
and
his
guests
and
then
put
it
to
his
own
lips
the
maiden
felt
she
was
no
longer
mistress
of
her
heart
which
was
beating
as
it
had
never
done
before
ii
you
might
teach
my
rothtraut
to
play
the
harp
cried
the
proud
lord
of
the
castle
who
was
in
a
very
lively
humour
having
partaken
freely
of
wine
she
heard
it
as
in
a
dream
and
the
musician
bowed
murmuring
that
he
was
not
worthy
to
receive
so
signal
an
honour
he
remained
however
at
the
castle
lovely
rothtraut
felt
afraid
in
her
heart
like
a
trembling
child
crossing
a
bridge
leading
to
flowery
meadows
she
had
no
mother
in
whom
she
could
confide
those
fears
for
which
she
could
find
no
words
she
therefore
yielded
to
her
desire
wishing
to
amuse
him
during
the
long
lonely
evenings
by
playing
and
singing
singing
came
naturally
to
her
for
a
nightingale
seemed
to
slumber
in
her
bosom
but
she
found
more
difficulty
with
the
harp
her
slender
fingers
drew
many
a
discordant
sound
from
the
strings
and
often
her
father
comfortably
seated
in
his
armchair
laughed
heartily
at
her
which
made
the
maiden
blush
with
shame
her
large
eyes
would
wander
from
the
harp
to
the
musician
face
but
her
confusion
only
became
worse
when
her
eyes
timidly
met
his
he
was
very
patient
with
all
her
imperfect
efforts
never
blaming
her
but
on
the
contrary
praising
all
her
modest
attempts
beyond
their
merits
then
he
would
sing
a
song
of
his
own
and
play
some
deep
chords
which
seemed
to
thrill
the
air
the
knight
would
listen
entranced
and
the
maiden
felt
love
blissful
pain
in
her
heart
she
did
not
know
what
it
was
or
how
he
had
long
since
sung
himself
into
her
soul
and
her
tender
heart
trembled
at
love
first
revelation
the
passion
possessed
her
more
and
more
it
spread
its
power
over
these
two
hearts
and
soon
in
the
quiet
garden
of
the
castle
ronald
clasped
the
daughter
of
the
proud
knight
to
his
heart
iii
love
first
rapture
is
often
followed
by
sorrow
however
and
beautiful
rothtraut
had
yet
to
experience
it
it
once
happened
that
the
knight
surprised
his
child
in
the
arms
his
anger
knew
no
bounds
and
like
a
beast
of
prey
he
rushed
at
the
singer
when
his
daughter
suddenly
become
a
woman
placed
herself
bravely
between
her
father
and
her
lover
her
confession
went
to
his
heart
like
a
dagger
for
with
trembling
lips
and
glowing
cheeks
the
maiden
acknowledged
the
secret
of
her
love
pale
but
firm
the
singer
stood
before
the
knight
i
am
only
a
wanderer
but
not
a
dishonourable
one
do
not
destroy
with
a
rough
hand
the
flower
which
god
has
planted
in
our
hearts
but
give
me
time
i
will
set
out
on
my
journey
and
will
take
up
arms
for
my
beloved
and
when
i
come
back
as
a
nobleman
you
will
give
me
your
daughter
who
loves
me
either
i
shall
return
as
a
knight
or
you
will
never
see
me
again
the
lord
of
the
castle
looked
at
him
sternly
while
his
daughter
stood
weeping
holding
ronald
hand
maiden
do
not
forget
me
rothtraut
he
was
gone
and
a
wailing
cry
burst
from
the
lips
of
the
unhappy
girl
iv
to
atone
for
many
a
wrong
against
pope
and
church
and
also
to
fulfil
a
solemn
vow
the
emperor
barbarossa
started
on
a
crusade
in
his
old
age
many
knights
and
heroes
joined
him
and
his
great
army
marched
through
several
countries
until
they
came
to
the
levant
then
they
journeyed
on
to
syria
where
the
great
hero
career
ended
barbarossa
was
drowned
and
the
eyes
of
his
followers
turned
to
henry
his
son
as
their
leader
the
latter
who
became
emperor
under
the
name
of
henry
vi
was
a
very
capable
general
he
was
also
a
lover
of
music
and
is
said
to
have
composed
many
a
melody
which
remains
with
us
to
the
present
day
many
supposed
that
it
was
not
the
royal
minstrel
who
composed
the
songs
but
that
they
came
from
the
hand
of
ronald
who
was
now
as
skilled
with
his
sword
as
with
his
harp
and
who
had
become
a
great
favourite
of
the
emperor
he
was
a
powerful
warrior
and
had
already
overthrown
many
a
saracen
once
when
the
crusaders
had
gained
a
glorious
victory
he
composed
a
song
in
honour
of
it
and
sang
it
himself
on
his
harp
the
song
went
the
round
of
the
camp
and
the
singer
became
a
great
friend
of
the
emperor
but
even
such
favour
did
not
drive
the
shadow
from
ronald
soul
and
often
when
he
was
singing
one
of
his
most
beautiful
songs
to
henry
he
would
suddenly
break
off
and
rush
out
of
the
tent
in
great
grief
one
day
the
emperor
found
out
what
he
had
long
guessed
and
made
ronald
confess
his
story
to
him
some
days
afterwards
the
crusaders
began
the
storming
of
acre
the
impregnable
fortress
of
the
saracens
ronald
was
fighting
by
side
a
saracen
dashed
his
falchion
at
the
king
head
but
ronald
with
a
mighty
blow
clove
the
infidel
skull
in
two
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
henry
called
all
his
warriors
together
and
dubbed
the
brave
champion
knight
with
his
own
hand
ronald
of
harfenstein
was
to
be
his
name
and
a
lyre
lying
on
a
falchion
and
a
sword
were
to
be
his
arms
the
emperor
promised
to
build
him
a
castle
on
the
borders
of
the
rhine
which
was
to
be
called
harfeneck
plague
broke
out
in
the
camp
and
many
a
gallant
crusader
fell
victim
to
it
among
them
was
the
emperor
himself
whose
death
caused
unspeakable
grief
to
ronald
one
day
a
weary
crusader
was
seen
riding
along
the
banks
of
the
rhine
wherever
he
passed
the
people
asked
him
if
it
were
true
that
barbarossa
was
not
drowned
in
the
holy
land
but
was
living
in
the
kyffhäuser
mountain
and
would
soon
come
back
to
his
own
neglected
kingdom
the
crusader
barely
answered
their
questions
but
urged
on
his
tired
steed
along
the
rhine
at
last
the
silvery
waters
of
the
ahr
appeared
before
him
and
he
saw
the
gables
of
the
castle
the
rider
joyously
spurred
on
his
horse
and
rode
up
through
the
forest
to
the
fortress
where
once
he
had
sat
on
the
drawbridge
as
a
poor
traveller
the
late
guest
was
ushered
up
to
the
lord
of
the
castle
the
knight
now
a
bent
old
man
rose
from
a
melancholy
reverie
to
greet
the
unknown
stranger
i
am
ronald
and
have
become
a
knight
through
the
grace
of
the
emperor
henry
in
the
camp
at
acre
and
now
i
have
come
to
win
your
daughter
rothtraut
win
her
from
death
for
it
robbed
me
of
her
two
months
ago
said
the
proud
lord
of
the
castle
turning
his
head
aside
in
deep
grief
then
a
despairing
groan
thrilled
through
the
chamber
harsh
words
passed
between
those
two
one
a
man
in
his
disconsolate
sorrow
the
other
a
repentant
father
ronald
strode
off
to
the
lonely
corner
of
the
garden
and
the
newly
dug
up
earth
showed
him
the
place
where
rothtraut
lay
there
he
remained
late
into
the
night
till
darkness
had
surrounded
him
and
black
night
had
settled
on
his
soul
then
he
turned
and
went
away
never
to
come
back
again
in
the
east
whence
the
crusaders
had
now
returned
everyone
talked
of
the
heroic
deeds
accomplished
by
richard
the
the
saracens
well
knew
the
fearless
leader
and
the
german
knight
who
fought
at
his
side
richard
valued
his
bravery
even
though
he
was
still
a
young
knight
he
meant
to
make
him
one
of
his
vassals
when
he
returned
to
his
own
country
but
his
desire
was
never
fulfilled
for
the
thrust
of
a
hostile
lance
which
he
had
so
often
escaped
pierced
the
knight
heart
so
the
minstrel
of
neuenahr
found
a
grave
in
the
holy
land
the
race
of
harfenstein
became
extinct
with
the
first
of
the
line
and
the
castle
was
never
built
eifel
the
arrow

prüm
it
was
in
the
little
town
of
prüm
many
a
long
year
ago
that
lothaire
the
degenerate
son
of
louis
did
penance
for
his
sins
in
the
church
belonging
to
the
town
there
are
two
very
ancient
pictures
one
of
them
represents
a
knight
standing
on
a
huge
rock
shooting
an
arrow
while
his
wife
and
retinue
are
looking
devoutedly
towards
heaven
the
other
represents
a
priest
at
an
altar
to
whom
an
angel
is
bringing
an
arrow
who
is
the
knight
who
is
the
holy
man
the
knight
is
nithard
noble
lord
of
guise
who
lived
in
the
north
of
france
towards
the
end
of
the
ninth
century
no
children
having
been
born
to
his
excellent
wife
erkanfrida
the
knight
determined
to
leave
his
estate
for
some
pious
object
he
meant
to
endow
a
cloister
where
after
their
deaths
masses
would
be
read
for
him
and
his
spouse
but
it
was
a
difficult
matter
to
select
the
most
worthy
from
the
many
cloisters
in
the
neighbourhood
and
by
the
advice
of
a
pious
priest
he
resolved
to
leave
the
decision
to
heaven
he
fastened
the
document
bequeathing
his
possessions
to
an
arrow
and
then
set
out
for
a
great
rock
near
the
castle
accompanied
by
his
wife
and
numerous
followers
after
a
fervent
prayer
he
shot
the
arrow
skyward
and
so
the
pious
story
runs
it
was
borne
by
angel
hands
till
it
came
to
prüm
a
journey
of
several
days
ansbald
the
holy
abbot
of
the
cloister
was
standing
at
the
altar
when
the
arrow
fell
at
his
feet
he
read
the
document
with
astonishment
and
gratitude
and
in
a
moved
voice
announced
its
contents
to
the
assembled
congregation
knight
nithard
assigned
his
estate
to
the
cloister
and
from
that
time
forth
many
pilgrims
journeyed
to
prüm
to
see
the
arrow
which
had
been
carried
there
by
angel
hands
the
storms
of
many
centuries
have
blown
over
those
hallowed
walls
but
the
pictures
in
the
old

belonging
to

still
remain

as
charlemagne
the
mighty
ruler
of
the
franks
rode
one
day
from
his
stronghold
at
into
the
surrounding
forest
his
horse
is
said
to
have
suddenly
trodden
upon
a
spring
on
touching
the
water
the
animal
drew
its
foot
back
neighing
loudly
as
if
in
great
pain
the
rider
curiosity
was
aroused
he
alighted
and
dipping
his
hand
into
the
spring
found
to
his
surprise
that
the
water
was
very
hot
thus
charlemagne
as
the
legend
records
discovered
the
hot
spring
which
was
to
become
the
salvation
of
many
thousands
of
ill
and
infirm
people
the
pious
emperor
recognised
in
this
healthgiving
spring
the
kind
gift
of
providence
and
he
resolved
to
erect
near
the
spot
a
house
of
god
the
round
shape
of
which
should
remind
posterity
of
the
horse
hoof
the
building
was
soon
begun
and
charlemagne
saw
with
great
satisfaction
the
walls
of
the
new
minster
rising
high
into
the
air
he
was
not
however
destined
to
see
its
completion
when
he
died
he
had
to
leave
the
great
empire
of
the
west
to
a
feeble
son
lewis
the
pious
the
latter
was
compelled
to
draw
his
sword
against
his
own
children
in
order
to
assure
for
himself
the
crown
he
had
inherited
many
a
great
undertaking
that
charlemagne
had
begun
remained
unfinished
the
building
of
the
minster
too
was
interrupted
the
ground
was
left
desolate
and
the
walls
and
towers
were
threatened
with
decay
before
they
were
finished
it
was
quite
useless
for
the
honourable
magistrate
of
the
town
to
apply
for
money
to
the
charitable
christian
inhabitants
contributions
came
in
very
slowly
and
were
never
sufficient
to
finish
the
church
the
aldermen
of
would
very
often
seriously
debate
the
question
and
discuss
how
they
could
remedy
the
grievous
lack
of
money
and
successfully
effect
the
completion
of
the
minster
they
found
however
that
good
counsel
was
just
as
rare
as
building
material
once
when
they
were
met
thus
together
a
stranger
was
announced
who
said
he
had
most
important
news
to
communicate
he
was
allowed
to
enter
the
session
room
after
having
duly
saluted
the
council
he
said
modestly
but
without
any
shyness
gentlemen
my
business
in
a
word
is
to
offer
you
the
money
for
the
completion
of
the
church
the
worthy
aldermen
looked
in
wonder
first
at
the
speaker
then
at
each
other
they
silently
agreed
in
the
opinion
that
the
man
before
them
looked
very
suspicious
in
his
quaint
outlandish
clothes
and
his
sharp
pointed
beard
but
the
newcomer
was
not
at
all
abashed
by
their
suspicious
looks
on
the
contrary
he
repeated
politely
but
firmly
his
proposal
saying
honourable
sirs
i
should
like
to
help
you
out
of
your
difficulty
and
will
advance
you
the
necessary
thousands
without
even
wishing
to
be
paid
back
at
this
frank
offer
the
councillors
pricked
up
their
ears
and
opened
their
eyes
wide
in
astonishment
before
they
could
recover
from
their
amazement
the
stranger
continued
i
know
well
you
are
all
far
too
proud
to
accept
this
great
offer
of
mine
without
giving
me
a
reward
of
some
sort
therefore
i
require
a
small
compensation
i
demand
the
first
living
being
body
and
soul
that
enters
the
new
minster
on
the
inauguration
day
on
hearing
this
the
honourable
aldermen
rose
horrified
from
their
seats
many
of
them
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
or
uttered
a
short
prayer
because
nobody
but
the
devil
himself
could
require
anything
so
monstrous
the
eyes
of
the
chairman
shot
a
reproachful
glance
at
the
strange
speaker
and
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
be
off
your
words
are
giving
offence
but
master
satan
the
stranger
stood
calmly
in
his
place
sirs
said
he
let
me
answer
you
with
a
word
from
the
scriptures
why
are
you
so
fearful
oh
ye
of
little
faith
on
the
field
of
battle
the
sword
mows
down
thousands
of
brave
men
they
fall
often
as
victims
to
the
ravening
ambition
of
a
single
man
you
can
even
see
fathers
fighting
against
their
sons
brothers
against
their
brothers
and
nobody
thinks
it
unjust
now
you
cry
out
when
i
only
ask
for
one
single
living
soul
to
be
sacrificed
for
the
welfare
of
the
whole
community
the
eyes
of
the
stranger
looked
round
in
triumphant
joy
when
he
had
finished
for
he
read
a
favourable
reply
in
the
puzzled
faces
of
the
aldermen
many
of
them
at
once
gave
up
their
scruples
and
after
a
few
minutes
even
the
most
cautious
among
them
had
no
more
objections
to
urge
the
offer
was
closed
with
and
master
satan
left
the
town
hall
with
a
proud
smile
the
next
day
the
council
was
again
gathered
together
anxiously
waiting
for
the
promised
sum
it
arrived
promptly
rightly
weighed
and
in
good
honest
coin
the
joy
of
the
aldermen
was
boundless
once
more
the
workmen
began
the
work
of
building
the
minster
they
worked
very
busily
as
if
to
make
up
for
the
long
interruption
and
after
three
years
the
cathedral
was
finished
on
the
day
when
the
new
church
was
to
be
consecrated
a
great
festival
was
held
in
the
town
the
distinguished
company
secular
as
well
as
clerical
who
appeared
at
the
inauguration
ceremony
praised
the
magnificence
of
the
minster
the
great
liberality
of
the
citizens
and
more
than
all
the
wisdom
of
the
town
council
the
aldermen
listened
to
the
general
praise
with
pleasure
and
accepted
it
as
their
due
they
felt
however
bound
to
confess
to
each
other
that
they
did
not
feel
easy
when
they
thought
of
the
inauguration
day
none
of
them
had
spoken
to
anybody
of
master
condition
only
one
of
them
a
henpecked
fellow
as
malicious
people
said
confessed
the
whole
transaction
to
his
wife
it
is
needless
to
say
that
from
that
moment
the
whole
town
knew
about
the
affair
on
the
important
day
of
the
consecration
of
the
minster
many
venerable
prelates
abbots
and
monks
thousands
of
noble
knights
and
lords
who
had
come
as
guests
and
the
whole
population
of
looked
forward
to
the
fatal
hour
with
beating
hearts
it
was
a
grand
procession
indeed
that
marched
on
in
ceremonious
solemnity
through
the
streets
the
gaily
coloured
flags
waved
merrily
in
the
air
the
trumpets
and
clarions
sounded
cheerily
the
nobility
and
clergy
were
in
their
most
gorgeous
attire
on
every
side
were
the
signs
of
joy
and
thanksgiving
but
the
hearts
of
the
people
were
all
oppressed
and
many
a
sorrowful
eye
gazed
at
the
morning
sky
as
if
expecting
to
see
satan
flying
down
with
his
wings
when
the
aldermen
in
their
bright
robes
joined
the
procession
the
general
anxiety
rose
to
the
highest
pitch
before
the
worthy
councillors
a
bulky
cage
was
carried
by
four
stout
footmen
what
was
hidden
under
the
covering
nobody
knew
but
everybody
felt
sure
that
it
contained
the
victim
when
the
procession
reached
the
minster
it
stopped
the
cage
being
carried
foremost
at
a
sign
from
the
mayor
one
of
the
footmen
quickly
stripped
off
the
cover
and
exposed
to
view
a
howling
hideous
wolf
two
of
the
men
pushed
the
church
door
wide
open
with
their
long
halberds
and
the
fourth
pushed
the
wolf
skilfully
through
the
open
door
a
terrible
noise
arose
suddenly
within
the
devil
had
been
waiting
for
his
spoil
as
a
tiger
that
watches
for
his
prey
when
the
wolf
entered
the
devil
darted
towards
it
but
seeing
that
it
was
only
a
beast
he
burst
into
a
wild
howl
of
rage
he
wrung
the
poor
wolf
neck
with
the
quickness
of
lightning
and
disappeared
suddenly
leaving
nothing
behind
him
but
a
strong
smell
of
sulphur
a
few
minutes
later
the
bells
rang
and
the
whole
magnificent
procession
thronged
into
the
church
duly
to
celebrate
its
consecration
while
divine
service
was
being
held
in
the
new
minster
and
hymns
of
praise
and
thanksgiving
were
offered
at
god
altar
the
devil
flew
with
horrible
maledictions
over
the
country
he
swore
an
oath
to
punish
with
the
utmost
severity
the
population
of
who
had
so
cunningly
outwitted
him
in
his
flight
he
came
to
the
where
he
stopped
a
little
in
order
to
consider
how
he
could
best
destroy
the
town
as
he
looked
at
the
sandy
dunes
the
thought
struck
him
that
he
might
bury
the
whole
town
with
all
its
prelates
and
abbots
under
such
a
hill
with
a
mighty
pull
he
tore
one
of
the
dunes
from
the
shore
piled
it
on
his
shoulders
and
flew
rapidly
towards
the
doomed
city
but
the
way
was
much
longer
than
master
satan
had
thought
he
began
to
perspire
very
freely
under
his
unwonted
burden
and
when
from
time
to
time
the
wind
blew
a
rain
of
loose
sand
into
his
eyes
he
swore
most
horribly
in
the
valley
of
the
soers
not
far
from
he
was
obliged
to
rest
as
he
was
very
tired
after
his
exertions
while
he
was
thus
sitting
by
the
wayside
wiping
his
forehead
and
looking
hot
and
weary
an
old
wrinkled
woman
came
limping
along
who
looked
with
suspicion
at
the
man
and
his
strange
burden
she
wanted
to
pass
by
without
saying
a
word
but
the
stranger
stopped
her
and
said
how
far
is
it
from
here
to
the
woman
cast
a
sharp
look
at
the
speaker
as
she
had
reached
years
of
discretion
being
now
in
her
year
she
was
shrewd
enough
to
recognise
in
the
man
before
her
the
very
devil
in
person
she
was
also
quite
sure
that
he
must
have
some
wicked
plan
in
his
head
against
the
good
town
therefore
assuming
a
very
sad
expression
she
answered
in
a
complaining
voice
kind
sir
i
am
so
sorry
for
you
the
way
to
the
town
is
still
very
long
only
look
at
my
boots
they
are
quite
worn
from
the
long
way
and
yet
i
got
them
new
from
the
shoemaker
at
master
satan
uttered
something
that
sounded
like
a
bitter
curse
then
he
shook
off
the
sandy
dune
from
his
shoulders
and
flew
away
in
a
fury
the
old
woman
was
for
a
moment
but
when
she
saw
the
fatal
figure
of
the
stranger
disappearing
she
was
inexpressibly
glad
at
having
saved
the
town
and
outwitted
the
devil
himself
if
he
had
only
looked
a
little
more
carefully
he
could
have
seen
the
tower
of
the
new
minster
not
a
mile
off
the
sandy
dune
is
still
lying
in
the
very
same
place
where
the
devil
dropped
it
its
name
is
losberg
or
ridmountain
so
called
because
the
town
got
rid
of
a
great
danger
the
memory
of
the
poor
wolf
is
also
still
preserved
its
image
is
engraved
on
the
middle
of
the
minster
door
where
you
can
also
see
the
big
cracks
produced
by
the
devil
hammering
it
in
his
impotent
anger
the
ring
of
fastrada
this
story
too
leads
us
back
to
the
time
of
the
great
emperor
charles
whose
life
has
come
down
to
us
with
a
halo
of
glory
charlemagne
favourite
residence
was
but
he
also
held
court
in
helvetia
his
imperial
stronghold
stood
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
of
zürich
in
its
neighbourhood
there
was
a
high
pillar
which
the
emperor
had
erected
to
mark
the
place
where
felix
and
regula
had
died
as
martyrs
for
the
christian
faith
a
small
bell
was
attached
to
this
monument
which
everybody
in
distress
and
want
might
ring
if
they
wanted
relief
as
often
as
charles
held
his
court
in
zürich
he
himself
appeared
at
the
pillar
when
the
bell
was
rung
and
listened
to
the
complaints
and
petitions
of
his
subjects
one
day
the
sound
of
the
bell
was
heard
yet
nobody
could
be
perceived
near
the
pillar
on
the
following
day
about
the
same
thing
happened
the
bell
rang
yet
no
one
was
there
the
emperor
curious
to
know
what
this
meant
commanded
one
of
his
pages
to
hide
in
the
bushes
behind
the
pillar
when
approached
the
boy
noticed
that
a
serpent
crept
out
of
the
sand
wriggled
up
to
the
pillar
and
set
the
bell
this
astonishing
fact
was
at
once
communicated
to
the
emperor
who
came
without
delay
to
the
spot
he
was
very
much
surprised
at
seeing
such
an
unusual
applicant
but
he
said
with
great
earnestness
every
one
who
comes
to
me
shall
find
justice
be
it
man
or
beast
the
serpent
bent
low
before
the
monarch
and
then
crept
back
into
its
den
charlemagne
followed
anxious
to
learn
the
reason
of
its
strange
behaviour
he
was
surprised
when
on
looking
into
the
dark
hole
he
saw
an
ugly
toad
sitting
on
the
serpent
eggs
and
filling
nearly
the
whole
space
with
its
hideous
form
the
emperor
bade
his
attendants
kill
the
intruder
at
once
in
a
short
time
charlemagne
had
nearly
forgotten
the
strange
incident
but
one
day
when
he
was
sitting
at
dinner
the
serpent
unexpectedly
entered
the
hall
and
crept
up
to
the
emperor
seat
bowing
low
three
times
it
lifted
its
head
and
dropped
a
precious
stone
into
the
emperor
goblet
it
then
disappeared
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
charlemagne
took
the
stone
out
of
the
cup
and
saw
to
his
amazement
that
it
was
a
precious
diamond
he
ordered
it
to
be
mounted
in
a
golden
ring
which
he
presented
to
his
wife
fastrada
the
jewel
possessed
a
wonderful
quality
fastrada
had
always
been
loved
tenderly
by
her
imperial
husband
but
after
the
diamond
ring
adorned
her
slender
finger
a
sweet
charm
seemed
to
bind
her
still
more
strongly
to
him
to
many
people
this
great
love
of
the
emperor
for
his
wife
seemed
too
absorbing
almost
superhuman
and
when
death
ruthlessly
snatched
her
from
the
side
of
charlemagne
everybody
believed
that
it
was
a
judgment
from
heaven
the
monarch
was
inconsolable
at
this
great
bereavement
he
spent
days
and
nights
in
unspeakable
grief
by
her
corpse
the
rumour
was
that
his
sorrow
was
so
intense
that
he
refused
to
permit
the
remains
of
his
wife
to
be
duly
buried
the
charm
the
living
fastrada
had
exercised
over
him
seemed
to
linger
even
after
her
death
the
archbishop
of
rheims
the
pious
turpin
heard
of
the
sorrow
and
he
offered
fervent
prayers
to
god
for
help
soon
afterwards
he
had
a
strange
dream
he
saw
the
wonderful
ring
on
fastrada
finger
glittering
with
a
thousand
lovely
colours
and
surrounding
the
emperor
with
a
magic
light
the
bishop
was
now
sure
that
the
precious
stone
was
the
cause
of
the
superhuman
love
the
emperor
bore
to
his
wife
on
the
following
day
before
sunrise
turpin
the
venerable
old
bishop
got
up
and
went
into
the
room
where
charlemagne
had
again
spent
a
night
in
bitter
grief
by
the
remains
of
his
beloved
wife
he
was
kneeling
by
the
uncovered
bier
in
fervent
prayer
when
the
bishop
entered
turpin
went
straight
up
to
the
body
and
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
he
took
the
cold
waxen
hand
of
fastrada
for
a
moment
in
his
without
being
observed
by
the
mourning
emperor
he
slipped
the
enchanted
ring
gently
from
her
finger
as
he
had
guessed
the
emperor
at
once
rose
and
kneeling
down
before
the
bishop
kissed
his
hand
in
adoration
then
he
rose
and
bade
turpin
have
the
remains
of
his
wife
buried
that
same
day
so
it
happened
that
fastrada
remains
were
brought
to
their
last
resting
place
in
the
church
of
albans
at
mayence
from
that
time
the
emperor
was
attached
with
rare
devotion
to
the
old
archbishop
of
rheims
he
would
not
allow
him
to
leave
his
side
but
requested
that
turpin
should
always
live
near
him
the
pious
man
was
also
nominated
first
councillor
of
the
empire
turpin
used
his
high
position
only
for
the
welfare
of
the
empire
and
did
a
great
many
good
works
sometimes
however
he
felt
a
pang
of
regret
at
the
manner
in
which
he
had
acquired
the
high
favour
of
his
lord
and
it
seemed
to
him
very
unfair
once
when
he
accompanied
the
monarch
on
one
of
his
journeys
in
western
germany
he
threw
the
ring
into
a
spring
from
which
it
could
never
more
be
brought
up
again
from
that
moment
charlemagne
felt
himself
irresistibly
drawn
to
that
particular
part
of
his
extensive
dominions
he
erected
a
stronghold
there
and
a
flourishing
township
soon
surrounded
this
palace
later
on
it
was
called
and
became
the
favourite
residence
of
the
great
emperor
within
its
walls
he
liked
best
to
rest
from
the
burden
of
affairs
of
state
and
sometimes
the
old
ruler
could
be
seen
sitting
by
the
margin
of
the
spring
in
which
fastrada
ring
lay
buried
recalling
the
sweet
memories
of
past
days

i
the
emperor
charlemagne
was
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
proud
knights
the
flower
of
whom
was
count
roland
of
angers
nephew
of
the
king
of
the
franks
the
name
of
no
knight
was
so
famous
in
battle
and
in
tournaments
as
his
helpless
innocency
adored
him
his
friends
admired
and
his
enemies
esteemed
him
his
chivalrous
spirit
had
no
love
for
the
luxuries
of
life
and
scorning
to
remain
inactive
at
the
emperor
court
he
went
to
his
imperial
uncle
begging
leave
to
go
and
travel
in
those
countries
of
the
mighty
kingdom
of
the
franks
which
up
to
that
time
were
unknown
to
him
in
his
youthful
fervour
he
longed
for
adventures
and
dangers
the
emperor
was
much
grieved
to
part
with
the
brave
knight
however
he
willingly
complied
with
his
request
one
day
early
in
the
morning
the
gallant
hero
left
his
uncle
palace
near
the
seine
and
rode
towards
the
vosges
mountains
accompanied
by
his
faithful
squire
the
first
object
of
his
journey
was
castle
niedeck
near
haslach
and
from
there
he
visited
attic
duke
of
alsace
he
continued
his
travels
and
one
evening
as
he
was
riding
through
the
mountains
the
glittering
waters
of
the
rhine
washing
both
sides
of
the
plain
greeted
him
the
river
in
that
part
of
the
country
offered
him
few
charms
in
its
savage
wildness
but
he
knew
that
the
scenery
would
soon
change
he
moved
on
down
the
rhine
to
where
a
gigantic
mountain
shuts
the
rushing
current
into
a
narrow
space
its
foot
stands
chained
in
the
floods
which
only
in
places
retire
a
little
thus
leaving
the
poor
folk
a
narrow
stretch
of
land
on
the
heights
there
were
proud
castles
telling
the
wanderer
below
of
the
fame
of
their
illustrious
races
thus
roland
made
many
a
long
journey
on
his
adventurous
course
down
the
rhine
he
passed
many
a
place
rich
in
old
memories
the
lorelei
rock
where
the
water
nymph
sang
at
night
the
cheerful
little
spot
where
goar
lived
and
worked
at
the
time
of
childebert
the
merovingian
that
wonderful
saint
who
once
spread
a
fog
over
his
imperial
uncle
compelling
him
to
pass
the
night
in
the
open
air
because
his
majesty
while
journeying
from
ingelheim
to
coblenz
had
neglected
to
bend
his
knee
in
his
chapel
and
the
green
meadows
near
andernach
where
genovefa
wife
of
palatine
count
siegfried
lived
and
now
roland
neared
the
place
where
the
stream
reaches
the
end
of
the
rhine
valley
and
where
the
seven
giants
are
to
be
seen
the
summit
of
one
of
which
is
crowned
with
a
castle
there
they
stand
like
the
seven
knights
who
in
later
times
stood
weeping
round
the
holy
remains
of
the
german
emperor
a
wooded
island
lay
in
the
waters
the
setting
sun
threw
a
golden
light
over
the
hills
on
the
sides
of
the
mountains
there
were
numberless
vineyards
to
the
left
hedges
of
beeches
ascending
to
the
heights
of
the
rugged
summits
to
the
right
the
murmur
of
the
rippling
waters
and
above
visible
among
the
legendary
rocks
where
once
a
terrible
beast
lived
the
pinnacles
of
a
knight
castle
and
over
all
the
heavens
clothed
with
a
garment
of
silver
stars
the
knight
paused
in
silence
his
glance
rested
admiringly
on
the
beautiful
picture
his
steed
pawed
the
ground
uneasily
with
his
hoofs
and
his
faithful
squire
looked
anxiously
at
the
darkening
sky
he
reminded
his
master
modestly
that
it
was
time
to
seek
shelter
for
the
night
i
should
like
to
beg
for
it
up
there
said
roland
dreamingly
an
inexplicable
feeling
of
sweet
sadness
coming
over
him
for
the
first
time
he
bade
his
squire
ask
the
boatman
who
was
putting
out
his
little
bark
to
cross
the
river
what
was
the
name
of
the
castle
the
castle
was
the
drachenburg
where
count
heribert
sojourned
sometimes
thus
ran
the
answer
which
pleased
roland
very
much
he
had
been
charged
with
many
greetings
and
messages
to
the
old
count
at
the
drachenburg
from
his
friends
living
near
the
upper
rhine
roland
now
hesitated
no
longer
and
soon
a
boat
was
ploughing
the
dark
waves
ii
in
the
meantime
night
had
come
on
the
full
moon
soft
beams
showed
them
their
way
through
the
dark
forest
count
heribert
a
worthy
knight
in
the
flower
of
his
age
bade
the
nephew
of
his
imperial
master
heartily
welcome
to
his
castle
far
past
midnight
they
stayed
in
the
count
chambers
engaged
in
entertaining
conversation
the
next
day
count
heribert
presented
his
daughter
hildegunde
to
the
knight
roland
eyes
full
of
admiration
rested
on
the
blushing
young
maiden
never
before
had
the
charms
of
a
woman
awakened
any
deep
feeling
in
his
heart
he
had
only
thirsted
after
glory
and
deeds
of
daring
after
tournaments
and
feuds
now
the
bold
champion
was
struck
with
a
shaft
from
the
quiver
of
love
he
who
had
opposed
the
dreaded
adversary
so
often
now
bowed
his
fearless
head
in
almost
girlish
confusion
before
hildegunde
charms
she
too
stood
crimsoning
deeply
before
the
celebrated
hero
whose
name
was
famous
and
who
was
beloved
in
all
the
country
round
the
old
knight
broke
up
the
scene
of
embarrassing
silence
between
the
youthful
couple
with
gay
laughing
words
and
conducted
his
guest
through
the
high
halls
of
his
castle
roland
tarried
longer
at
the
friendly
castle
than
he
had
ever
done
before
in
any
other
place
in
the
country
he
seemed
bound
to
the
blissful
spot
by
love
indissoluble
chains
and
so
it
happened
that
one
day
these
two
found
themselves
hand
in
hand
the
deep
love
in
their
hearts
rushing
forth
in
ardent
words
count
heribert
bestowed
his
lovely
daughter
very
willingly
on
the
celebrated
knight
his
only
desire
being
to
complete
the
happiness
of
his
child
whom
he
loved
so
dearly
a
castle
should
be
erected
for
her
on
the
heights
of
the
rocks
on
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
opposite
the
drachenburg
and
this
proud
fort
on
the
rugged
rocky
corner
of
the
mountain
should
be
a
for
the
glorious
seven
mountains
and
their
castle
in
later
times
it
became
the
famous
rolandseck
soon
the
walls
could
be
seen
raising
themselves
up
and
every
day
the
lovers
stood
on
the
balcony
of
the
drachenburg
looking
across
where
industrious
workmen
and
masons
were
busily
toiling
hildegunde
began
to
weave
sweet
dreams
of
the
future
round
her
new
home
where
she
meant
to
chain
the
adventurous
hero
with
true
love
but
one
day
a
messenger
appeared
at
the
drachenburg
on
a
horse
white
with
foam
he
was
sent
by
charlemagne
and
brought
the
tidings
of
a
crusade
which
the
emperor
had
decreed
against
the
infidels
beyond
the
pyrenees
charlemagne
desired
to
have
the
famous
knight
among
the
leaders
of
his
army
roland
received
the
message
of
his
great
master
in
silence
he
looked
at
hildegunde
who
with
a
face
was
standing
beside
him
grief
stabbed
cruelly
at
his
heart
but
he
must
obey
the
call
of
honour
and
duty
and
informing
the
royal
messenger
that
he
would
arrive
at
the
imperial
camp
in
three
days
he
turned
sorrowfully
away
hildegunde
sobbing
at
his
side
iii
the
cross
and
the
were
fighting
furiously
for
the
upper
hand
in
spain
terrible
battles
were
fought
and
much
blood
flowed
from
both
christians
and
infidels
bloody
victories
were
gained
by
the
emperor
brave
knights
the
chief
of
whom
was
roland
his
sword
forced
a
triumphant
way
for
charlemagne
it
guarded
his
army
passing
victoriously
through
the
unknown
country
of
the
enemies
but
the
sad
day
of
ronceval
so
often
sung
by
german
and
other
poets
was
yet
to
come
separated
from
the
main
body
of
the
army
roland
brave
rearguard
was
making
its
way
through
the
dusky
forest
suddenly
wild
shouts
sounded
from
the
heights
and
the
cowardly
moor
pressed
down
on
the
little
band
threatening
them
with
destruction
but
the
noble
franks
fought
like
lions
roland
charger
brilliador
flew
now
here
now
there
and
many
a
saracen
was
hewn
down
by
its
noble
sword
durant
but
numbers
conquer
bravery
the
little
army
of
franks
became
less
and
less
and
at
last
roland
sank
struck
by
the
lance
of
a
gigantic
moor
the
combat
continued
furiously
round
him
when
night
spread
mournfully
over
the
the
infidels
had
already
done
their
terrible
work
the
franks
lay
dead
only
a
few
had
escaped
from
the
slaughter
where
is
roland
was
the
frightened
cry
from
pale
lips
he
was
not
among
the
saved
where
is
roland
asked
charlemagne
anxiously
of
the
messengers
through
the
whole
kingdom
their
answers
seemed
to
resound
roland
the
hero
had
fallen
in
battle
fighting
against
the
saracens
wherever
this
cry
was
heard
it
awakened
deep
sorrow
the
news
soon
spread
as
far
as
the
rhine
and
one
day
the
imperial
messengers
appeared
at
the
drachenburg
bringing
the
sad
tidings
and
the
deepest
sympathy
of
the
emperor
heribert
sighed
deeply
on
hearing
the
news
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
hildegunde
grief
was
before
the
altar
of
the
queen
of
sorrows
she
lay
sobbing
her
heart
out
imploring
for
comfort
in
her
great
need
for
days
on
end
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
little
bower
and
even
her
father
gentle
sympathy
could
not
assuage
her
bitter
grief
weeks
passed
then
one
day
the
pale
maiden
entered
the
chamber
her
grief
quite
transfigured
he
drew
her
softly
towards
him
and
then
she
revealed
the
resolution
which
was
in
her
heart
count
heribert
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
but
he
pressed
a
loving
kiss
on
her
pure
forehead
the
day
came
when
down
below
on
the
island
nonnenwert
the
convent
bells
rang
solemnly
a
new
novice
count
heribert
lovely
daughter
knelt
before
the
altar
in
the
holy
stillness
of
the
convent
she
sought
the
peace
which
she
could
not
find
in
the
castle
of
her
father
with
a
last
great
convulsive
sob
she
had
torn
her
lover
name
from
her
heart
had
quenched
the
flame
of
sorrowing
love
for
him
and
now
her
soul
was
to
be
filled
ever
with
the
holy
fire
of
the
love
of
god
in
vain
her
afflicted
father
hoped
that
the
unaccustomed
loneliness
of
the
convent
would
shake
her
resolution
and
that
when
the
first
year
trial
was
over
she
would
return
to
him
but
no
the
pious
young
maiden
fervently
begged
the
bishop
who
was
a
relation
of
her
father
to
release
her
from
the
year
trial
and
to
allow
her
after
a
short
time
to
take
her
final
vows
her
longing
desire
was
fulfilled
after
a
month
hildegunde
golden
locks
were
no
more
and
the
lovely
daughter
of
the
drachenburg
was
dedicated
to
the
lord
forever
iv
time
rolled
on
spring
had
vanished
and
the
sheaves
were
ripening
in
the
fields
where
the
river
reaches
the
end
of
the
rhine
valley
crowned
by
the
seven
giants
a
knight
with
his
horse
stopped
to
rest
far
away
in
the
south
where
the
valley
of
ronceval
lies
bathed
in
sunshine
he
had
lain
in
the
hut
of
a
poor
herd
there
the
faithful
squire
had
dragged
his
master
pierced
by
a
moorish
lance
the
bold
hero
and
leader
had
remained
for
weeks
and
months
on
his
struggling
with
death
till
the
force
of
his
iron
nature
had
at
last
conquered
roland
was
recovering
under
loving
care
while
they
were
mourning
him
as
dead
in
the
land
of
the
franks
then
having
recovered
he
hurried
back
to
the
rhine
urged
by
an
irresistible
longing
a
wooded
island
lay
in
the
waters
the
setting
sun
threw
a
golden
light
over
the
hills
numberless
vineyards
flanked
the
mountains
hedges
of
beeches
were
on
one
side
the
murmur
of
waters
on
the
other
and
above
the
pinnacles
of
a
knight
castle
among
the
legendary
rocks
where
once
a
terrible
beast
lived
over
all
the
heavens
clothed
with
a
garment
of
silver
stars
silently
the
knight
paused
his
glance
resting
admiringly
on
the
beautiful
picture
now
as
in
months
before
an
inexplicable
feeling
of
sweet
sadness
came
over
the
dreamer
hildegunde
murmured
roland
glancing
up
at
the
starry
heavens
again
as
formerly
a
boatman
rowed
across
the
stream
and
roland
soon
was
striding
through
the
forest
towards
the
drachenburg
accompanied
by
his
faithful
squire
the
old
watchman
at
the
castle
stared
at
the
late
guest
and
crossing
himself
he
rushed
up
to
the
chambers
of
his
master
a
man
figure
bent
with
age
and
sorrow
tottered
forward
roland
he
gasped
forth
the
knight
supported
the
old
man
in
his
arms
when
roland
had
departed
long
ago
his
grief
had
found
no
tears
now
they
flowed
abundantly
down
his
cheeks
the
knight
tore
himself
from
the
other
arms
where
is
she
he
asked
in
a
hoarse
voice
dead
count
heribert
looked
at
him
with
unspeakable
sorrow
hildegunde
bride
of
roland
whom
they
supposed
dead
is
now
a
bride
of
heaven
the
hero
groaned
aloud
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
in
spring
he
left
the
drachenburg
and
went
to
the
castle
on
the
rocky
corner
and
there
he
laid
down
his
arms
for
ever
his
thirst
for
action
was
quenched
day
by
day
he
sat
over
there
looking
silently
down
on
the
green
island
in
the
rhine
where
the
nun
hildegunde
wandered
about
among
the
flowers
in
the
convent
garden
every
morning
sometimes
indeed
it
seemed
that
she
bowed
kindly
to
him
then
the
knight
face
would
be
lighted
up
with
a
gleam
of
his
old
happiness
but
even
this
joy
was
taken
from
him
one
day
his
beloved
did
not
appear
and
soon
the
tolled
sorrowfully
over
the
island
he
saw
a
coffin
which
they
were
carrying
to
its
last
and
he
heard
the
nuns
chanting
the
service
for
the
dead
he
saw
them
all
only
one
was
wanting
then
he
covered
his
face
he
knew
whom
they
were
carrying
to
the
grave
autumn
came
withering
the
fresh
green
on
hildegunde
tomb
but
roland
still
kept
his
watch
gazing
motionlessly
at
the
little
churchyard
and
one
day
his
squire
found
him
there
cold
and
dead
his
eyes
turned
towards
the
place
where
his
loved
one
was
sleeping
for
many
a
century
the
proud
castle
which
they
called
rolandseck
crowned
the
mountain
then
it
fell
into
ruins
like
the
mighty
drachenburg
the
tower
of
which
is
still
standing
fifty
years
ago
the
last
arches
of
roland
castle
were
blown
down
one
stormy
night
but
later
on
they
were
built
up
again
in
memory
of
this
tale
of
true
and
faithful
love
in
the
olden
times

the

is
still
crowned
by
the
tower
and
walls
of
an
old
knight
castle
a
most
touching
legend
is
related
of
the
mountain
with
the
terrible
name
in
the
first
centuries
after
the
birth
of
the
world
redeemer
the
germans
on
the
left
side
of
the
rhine
accepted
willingly
the
doctrines
of
the
cross
maternus
a
disciple
of
the
great
apostle
had
brought
them
over
from
gaul
at
first
the
pious
messenger
of
christ
worked
among
the
heathen
tribes
in
vain
they
persisted
in
their
paganism
and
even
prevented
the
priests
from
coming
into
their
country
at
that
time
there
was
a
terrible
dragon
living
in
the
hollow
of
the
rock
which
even
now
is
called
the
dragon
hole
he
was
of
a
hideous
form
and
every
day
he
used
to
leave
his
den
and
rage
through
the
forests
and
valleys
threatening
men
and
animals
human
strength
was
powerless
against
this
monster
the
people
thought
that
an
angry
deity
had
his
abode
in
this
terrible
beast
so
they
bestowed
godlike
honours
on
him
sacrificing
criminals
and
prisoners
to
him
a
tribe
of
heathens
lived
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
these
men
desirous
of
war
often
made
raids
on
the
neighbouring
countries
carrying
fire
and
sword
among
their
christian
brothers
they
once
crossed
the
water
plundering
the
land
and
making
prisoners
of
the
people
among
the
latter
there
was
one
most
lovely
maiden
whose
beauty
and
grace
inflamed
two
of
the
leaders
so
much
that
each
of
them
desired
to
have
her
for
himself
one
was
called
horsrik
the
elder
a
famous
chieftain
known
to
have
the
strength
of
a
bear
and
the
wildness
of
a
tiger
the
other
rinbold
of
a
less
rough
nature
but
of
equal
bravery
the
beautiful
maiden
turned
aside
shuddering
when
she
saw
the
two
chiefs
glaring
eyes
contending
for
possession
of
her
all
round
were
their
men
intoxicated
with
victory
the
struggle
for
the
christian
maid
affected
the
two
leaders
more
than
the
division
of
the
booty
soon
the
angry
words
of
the
two
opponents
found
an
echo
in
the
hearts
of
the
men
standing
round
horsrik
the
fighter
claimed
her
and
was
received
with
cheers
rinbold
the
proud
young
chieftain
claimed
her
also
great
applause
greeted
him
the
former
glared
sternly
grasping
his
club
in
a
threatening
manner
the
an
old
man
with
hair
and
stern
features
stepped
in
between
the
two
combatants
and
in
a
voice
surging
with
anger
he
said
cursed
be
every
dissension
for
the
possession
of
this
stranger
a
christian
must
not
disunite
the
noblest
of
our
tribe
a
daughter
of
those
we
hate
she
shall
fall
to
nobody
share
she
the
author
of
so
much
strife
shall
be
sacrificed
to
the
dragon
and
shall
be
dedicated
to
woden
honour
at
the
next
rising
of
the
sun
the
men
murmured
applause
horsrik
more
than
the
rest
the
maiden
held
her
head
upright
rinbold
the
proud
young
chieftain
looked
sorrowfully
at
her
face
ii
early
the
following
day
before
the
sun
had
poured
his
bright
beams
on
the
earth
the
valley
showed
signs
of
life
through
the
dusk
of
the
forest
a
noisy
procession
moved
upwards
towards
the
highest
point
the
priest
in
the
middle
behind
him
the
prisoner
pale
but
resolute
silently
for
her
lord
sake
she
had
allowed
the
priest
to
bind
her
forehead
as
a
victim
and
to
place
consecrated
flowers
in
her
loose
flowing
hair
many
a
sympathetic
look
from
the
crowd
had
been
cast
at
the
steadfast
maiden
the
young
chieftain
was
stricken
with
pain
at
the
sight
of
her
countenance
there
stood
the
projecting
rock
which
had
often
been
dishonoured
by
human
blood
the
fanatical
priests
wound
ropes
round
the
body
and
then
tied
her
to
woden
tree
which
overhung
the
precipice
no
complaint
escaped
the
christian
white
lips
no
tears
glistened
in
her
eyes
which
were
glancing
up
at
the
morning
sky
the
throng
of
people
moved
off
waiting
silently
in
the
distance
to
see
what
would
happen
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
streamed
over
the
mountain
they
lighted
up
the
wreath
of
flowers
in
the
maiden
hair
playing
about
her
lovely
face
and
crowning
it
with
glory
the
christian
maid
was
awaiting
death
as
a
bride
awaits
her
bridegroom
her
lips
moving
slightly
as
in
prayer
a
gloomy
sound
came
up
from
the
depths
the
dragon
started
from
his
den
spitting
fire
on
his
path
he
cast
a
look
at
his
victim
there
on
the
spot
which
his
maw
knew
so
well
he
raised
his
scaly
body
thus
letting
his
sharp
claws
be
more
visible
moved
his
snaky
tail
in
a
circle
and
showed
his
gaping
mouth
snorting
the
monster
crawled
along
shooting
flames
out
of
his
bloodshot
eyes
a
shudder
of
death
crept
over
the
maiden
at
the
sight
of
this
awful
beast
tremblingly
she
tore
a
sparkling
golden
crucifix
from
her
breast
held
it
towards
the
monster
piteously
and
called
on
her
lord
in
a
voice
wonder
of
wonders
raising
himself
as
if
struck
by
lightning
the
monster
turned
dashing
himself
backwards
over
the
jagged
stones
into
the
waters
below
and
disappearing
in
the
river
among
the
falling
rocks
wondering
cries
arose
from
the
waiting
heathens
astonishment
and
wonder
were
depicted
on
every
face
in
quiet
submission
her
eyes
the
maiden
stood
praying
to
him
who
had
saved
her
the
cords
fell
from
her
sides
two
strong
arms
caught
her
and
carried
her
into
the
midst
of
the
astonished
crowd
she
raised
her
eyes
and
perceived
the
younger
of
the
two
chieftains
his
rough
warlike
hand
had
seized
hers
the
young
man
bent
his
knee
as
if
to
a
heavenly
being
and
touched
her
white
fingers
with
his
lips
loud
applause
greeted
him
on
all
sides
the
old
priest
came
forward
the
people
waiting
in
great
expectation
who
had
saved
her
from
certain
destruction
who
was
the
god
who
so
visibly
aided
his
own
asked
he
solemnly
of
the
christian
with
bright
eyes
the
maiden
answered
triumphantly
this
picture
of
christ
has
crushed
the
dragon
and
saved
me
the
salvation
of
the
world
and
the
welfare
of
man
lies
in
him
the
priest
glanced
at
the
crucifix
with
reverent
awe
may
it
soon
lighten
your
spirit
and
those
of
all
these
people
round
said
the
maiden
earnestly
it
will
reveal
greater
wonders
than
this
to
you
for
our
god
is
great
the
maiden
and
all
the
other
prisoners
were
conducted
back
to
their
own
country
but
the
former
soon
returned
again
accompanied
by
a
christian
priest
the
voice
of
truth
and
innocence
worked
wonders
in
the
hearts
of
the
heathens
thousands
were
converted
and
baptized
the
old
priest
and
rinbold
were
the
first
who
bowed
their
heads
in
submission
to
the
new
doctrine
great
rejoicings
were
held
among
the
tribe
when
the
maiden
gave
her
hand
to
the
young
chieftain
a
christian
temple
was
erected
in
the
valley
and
a
splendid
castle
was
built
on
the
summit
of
the
rocks
for
the
couple
for
about
ten
centuries
their
descendants
flourished
there
a
very
powerful
race
in
the
rhine
countries
the
monk
of
heisterbach
in
olden
times
in
a
lovely
valley
near
the
seven
mountains
stood
a
cloister
called
heisterbach
even
now
parts
of
the
walls
of
this
old
monastery
remain
and
it
was
not
by
the
hand
of
time
but
by
the
barbarism
of
foolish
warfare
that
its
halls
fell
into
ruins
the
monks
were
driven
away
the
abbey
was
pulled
down
and
the
stones
were
used
for
the
building
of
a
fortress
since
that
time
so
the
country
folk
relate
the
spirits
of
the
banished
monks
wander
nightly
among
the
ruins
raising
mute
accusations
against
their
persecutors
and
the
destroyers
of
their
cells
among
them
there
was
one
gebhard
the
last
prior
of
heisterbach
who
now
they
say
wanders
about
the
graves
of
the
monks
and
also
haunts
the
of
the
masters
of
löwenburg
and
drachenburg
in
the
middle
ages
the
monks
of
heisterbach
were
very
famous
many
a
rare
copy
of
the
holy
scriptures
many
a
highly
learned
piece
of
writing
was
sent
out
into
the
world
from
this
hermitage
telling
of
the
industry
and
learning
of
the
pious
monks
there
was
one
brother
still
young
in
years
who
distinguished
himself
by
his
learning
he
was
looked
up
to
by
all
the
other
brethren
and
even
the
father
prior
had
recourse
to
his
stores
of
knowledge
but
the
poisonous
worm
of
doubt
began
to
gnaw
at
his
soul
the
mirror
of
his
faith
was
blurred
by
his
deep
meditations
his
keen
eye
would
often
wander
over
the
faded
parchment
on
which
the
living
word
of
god
was
written
while
his
childlike
believing
heart
humbly
submitting
itself
would
lamentingly
cry
out
lord
i
believe
help
thou
mine
unbelief
like
a
ghost
his
restless
doubts
would
hover
about
him
making
his
soul
the
scene
of
tormenting
struggle
one
night
with
flushed
face
he
had
been
meditating
over
a
parchment
at
daybreak
he
still
remained
engrossed
in
his
thoughts
the
morning
sun
threw
his
bright
rays
over
the
heavens
casting
playful
beams
on
the
written
roll
in
the
monk
hands
but
he
saw
them
not
his
thoughts
were
wholly
taken
up
by
a
passage
which
for
months
past
had
ever
been
hidden
to
him
and
had
been
the
constant
subject
of
his
reflections
a
thousand
years
are
but
as
a
day
in
thy
sight
his
brain
had
already
long
tormented
itself
over
the
obscure
words
of
the
psalmist
and
with
a
great
effort
he
had
striven
to
blot
it
out
of
his
memory
and
now
the
words
danced
again
before
his
weary
eyes
growing
larger
and
larger
those
confusing
black
signs
seemed
to
become
a
sneering
doubt
hovering
round
him
a
thousand
years
are
but
as
a
day
in
thy
sight
he
tore
himself
away
from
the
silent
cell
seeking
the
cool
solitude
of
the
there
with
a
heavy
heart
he
paced
the
paths
torturing
himself
with
horrid
doubts
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
his
mind
was
far
away
from
the
peaceful
garden
and
without
being
aware
of
what
he
was
doing
he
left
the
and
wandered
out
into
the
neighbouring
forest
the
birds
in
the
trees
greeted
him
cordially
the
flowers
opened
their
eyes
at
his
approach
but
the
wretched
man
heard
and
saw
nothing
but
the
words
a
thousand
years
are
but
as
a
day
in
thy
sight
his
wandering
steps
grew
feeble
his
feverish
brain
weary
from
want
of
sleep
then
the
monk
sank
down
on
a
stone
and
laid
his
troubled
head
against
a
tree
a
sweet
peaceful
dream
stole
over
his
spirit
he
found
himself
in
spheres
glowing
with
light
the
waters
of
eternity
were
rushing
round
the
throne
of
the
most
high
creation
appeared
and
praised
his
works
and
heaven
extolled
their
glory
from
the
worm
in
the
dust
which
no
earthly
being
has
been
able
to
create
to
the
eagle
soaring
above
the
heights
of
the
earth
from
the
grain
of
sand
on
the
to
the
gigantic
crater
which
at
the
lord
command
vomits
fire
out
of
its
throat
which
has
been
closed
for
thousands
of
years
they
all
spoke
with
one
voice
which
is
not
heard
by
the
haughty
being
only
manifest
and
comprehensible
to
the
humble
these
were
the
words
of
him
who
created
them
be
it
in
six
days
or
in
six
thousand
years
a
thousand
years
are
but
as
a
day
in
thy
sight
with
a
slight
shudder
the
monk
opened
his
eyes
i
believe
lord
help
thou
my
unbelief
murmured
he
taking
heart
the
bell
sounded
in
the
distance
they
were
ringing
for
vespers
sunset
was
already
gleaming
through
the
forest
the
monk
hastily
turned
towards
the
cloister
the
chapel
was
lighted
up
and
through
the
door
he
could
see
the
brothers
in
their
stalls
he
hurried
noiselessly
to
his
place
but
to
his
astonishment
he
found
that
another
monk
was
there
he
touched
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
and
strange
to
tell
the
man
he
saw
was
unknown
to
him
the
brothers
now
one
now
another
raised
their
heads
and
looked
in
silent
questioning
at
the
new
comer
a
peculiar
feeling
seized
the
poor
monk
who
saw
only
strange
faces
round
him
growing
pale
he
waited
till
the
singing
was
over
confused
questions
seemed
to
pass
along
the
rows
the
prior
a
dignified
old
man
with
hair
approached
what
is
your
name
strange
brother
asked
he
in
a
gentle
kind
tone
the
monk
was
filled
with
dismay
maurus
murmured
he
in
a
trembling
voice
bernhard
was
the
abbot
who
received
my
vows
in
the
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
king
conrad
whom
they
called
the
frank
incredulous
astonishment
was
depicted
on
the
brothers
countenances
the
monk
raised
his
face
to
the
old
prior
and
confessed
to
him
how
he
had
wandered
out
in
the
early
morning
into
the
how
he
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
forest
and
had
not
wakened
till
the
bell
for
vespers
sounded
the
prior
made
a
sign
to
one
of
the
brothers
then
turning
to
the
monk
he
said
it
is
almost
three
hundred
years
since
the
death
of
bernhard
and
of
conrad
whom
they
called
the
frank
the
cloister
annals
were
brought
and
it
was
there
found
that
three
hundred
years
had
passed
since
the
days
of
bernhard
the
prior
also
read
the
following
note
a
doubter
disappeared
one
day
from
the
cloister
and
no
one
ever
knew
what
became
of
him
a
shudder
ran
through
the
monk
limbs
this
was
he
this
brother
maurus
who
had
now
come
back
to
the
cloister
after
three
hundred
years
what
the
prior
had
read
sounded
in
his
ears
as
if
it
were
the
trumpet
of
the
last
judgment
three
hundred
years
with
eyes
he
gazed
before
him
then
stretched
forth
his
hands
as
if
seeking
for
help
the
brothers
supported
him
observing
him
at
the
same
time
with
secret
dismay
his
face
had
become
ashy
pale
like
that
of
a
dying
person
the
narrow
circle
of
hair
on
his
head
had
become
my
brothers
murmured
he
in
a
dying
voice
value
the
imperishable
word
of
the
lord
at
all
times
and
never
try
to
fathom
what
he
in
his
wisdom
has
veiled
from
us
may
my
example
never
be
blotted
out
of
your
memory
only
the
words
of
the
psalmist
were
revealed
to
me
thousand
years
are
but
as
a
day
in
thy
sight
may
he
have
mercy
on
me
a
poor
sinner
he
sank
lifeless
to
the
ground
and
the
brothers
greatly
moved
repeated
the
prayers
for
the
dead
over
his
body
the
origin
of
the
seven
mountains
in
olden
times
the
rhine
flowed
into
a
deep
mighty
lake
above
the
town
of
königswinter
those
who
then
lived
near
the
eifel
mountains
or
on
the
heights
of
the
westerwald
were
in
constant
fear
of
these
swelling
waters
which
often
overflowed
causing
great
destruction
in
the
country
they
began
to
consider
that
some
great
saviour
was
necessary
and
sent
a
messenger
into
the
country
of
the
giants
begging
some
of
them
to
come
down
and
bore
through
the
mountain
which
prevented
the
waters
from
flowing
onward
they
would
receive
valuable
presents
as
a
recompense
so
one
day
seven
giants
arrived
in
their
country
bringing
enormous
spades
with
them
and
with
a
few
good
strokes
of
their
tools
they
made
a
gap
in
the
mountain
so
that
in
a
few
days
the
water
washed
through
the
gap
which
visibly
became
larger
at
last
the
river
streamed
through
in
torrents
the
lake
gradually
dried
up
and
completely
disappeared
and
the
liberated
rhine
flowed
majestically
towards
the
plain
the
giants
looked
at
their
work
with
satisfaction
the
grateful
folk
brought
them
rich
treasures
which
they
had
taken
out
of
the
mines
having
divided
them
fraternally
the
giants
shouldered
their
spades
and
went
their
way
these
heaps
of
rocky
ground
which
they
had
dug
out
were
so
great
that
ever
since
they
have
been
called
the
seven
mountains
and
will
remain
there
until
the
giants
come
again
and
sweep
them
away
the
nightingale
valley
at
honnef
honnef
is
one
of
the
most
lovely
little
spots
on
the
earth
nestling
sweetly
at
the
foot
of
the
old
drachenfels
the
mountain
protects
it
from
the
icy
winds
of
the
north
and
the
breezes
blow
gently
in
the
valley
which
may
be
called
the
german
nice
when
the
setting
sun
reminds
the
wanderer
on
the
drachenfels
of
coming
darkness
and
he
strolls
down
through
the
valley
of
honnef
the
songs
of
numerous
nightingales
sound
in
his
ears
this
has
been
the
of
these
songsters
for
many
a
long
year
and
there
is
an
old
legend
which
gives
us
the
reason
there
was
a
time
when
they
used
to
sing
in
the
forest
round
the
old
abbey
himmerode
as
they
now
do
in
the
valley
of
honnef
the
pious
monks
walking
about
in
the
cloister
gardens
in
holy
contemplation
heard
their
seductive
songs
the
penitents
in
their
cells
mortifying
the
flesh
heard
them
also
their
alluring
warble
mingled
itself
with
their
murmured
prayers
and
in
the
heart
of
many
a
monk
who
had
long
since
renounced
the
world
and
its
pleasures
the
remembrance
of
them
was
gently
awakened
and
sweet
sinful
things
were
whispered
into
the
holy
brother
ears
then
one
day
it
happened
that
bernhard
came
to
the
abbey
himmerode
to
examine
the
brother
hearts
he
was
greatly
distressed
to
find
that
many
a
holy
soul
had
turned
from
the
path
of
peace
and
the
cause
of
this
also
became
known
to
him
in
a
violent
passion
the
holy
man
strode
out
into
the
forest
surrounding
the
cloister
and
raising
his
hand
angrily
towards
the
seductive
singers
he
cried
go
from
here
ye
are
a
curse
to
us
bernhard
had
spoken
threateningly
and
lo
with
a
great
stir
in
the
branches
a
throng
of
numberless
nightingales
rose
from
the
bushes
filled
the
forest
once
more
with
their
glorious
song
and
fled
with
a
great
flapping
of
wings
they
settled
down
in
the
valley
of
honnef
and
no
excommunication
has
driven
them
from
there
those
who
wander
there
are
not
averse
to
the
pleasures
of
the
world
like
bernhard
and
every
one
after
his
own
manner
reads
a
different
meaning
in
their
song
godesberg
the
high
cross
at
godesberg
if
you
walk
on
the
high
road
between
bonn
and
godesberg
which
is
not
far
distant
you
perceive
on
the
left
side
shimmering
white
amid
the
green
woodland
a
high
pillar
crowned
with
a
cross
known
as
the
high
cross
it
is
a
pleasing
sight
to
him
who
passes
by
on
a
bright
day
but
in
the
twilight
its
glaring
white
contrasting
so
sharply
with
the
dark
back
ground
makes
a
dismal
impression
on
him
which
is
still
more
enhanced
by
the
legend
told
about
it
the
story
leads
us
back
to
the
time
when
instead
of
the
grey
ruins
a
proud
stronghold
near
godesberg
looked
down
into
the
wonderful
valley
of
the
rhine
an
old
knight
lived
there
who
was
well
known
far
and
near
for
his
bravery
and
generosity
his
beloved
wife
had
died
leaving
him
two
sons
the
elder
was
the
very
image
of
his
mother
in
body
and
mind
he
had
gentle
childlike
manners
and
it
was
therefore
natural
that
the
father
eye
rested
with
more
pleasure
on
him
than
on
the
younger
son
who
was
very
daring
and
in
spite
of
his
youth
had
already
gone
after
strange
and
not
always
honourable
adventures
yet
the
old
father
did
not
grieve
much
on
his
account
hoping
that
the
sooner
the
reckless
youth
emptied
his
cup
of
pleasure
the
sooner
he
would
come
to
the
bitter
dregs
then
like
others
he
would
surely
become
more
serious
and
would
yet
fulfil
the
longing
desire
of
his
late
mother
she
had
fervently
wished
to
see
him
when
a
man
adorned
with
ring
which
the
bishops
of
cologne
wore
while
erich
the
elder
should
become
lord
of
godesberg
castle
the
father
thoughts
lingered
with
pleasure
on
the
pleasant
prospects
of
his
sons
future
he
sent
up
many
a
fervent
prayer
to
heaven
for
the
fulfilment
of
his
desires
well
knowing
that
the
spirit
of
his
beloved
wife
supported
him
at
the
throne
of
the
almighty
with
her
own
supplications
the
old
knight
often
spoke
to
his
younger
son
about
his
vocation
in
life
but
always
observed
with
disappointment
that
his
son
avoided
any
allusion
to
the
subject
when
the
father
felt
his
death
approaching
he
imparted
once
more
his
wish
to
his
two
sons
that
the
elder
should
become
master
of
the
castle
and
the
younger
bishop
of
cologne
with
a
blessing
for
them
on
his
lips
he
closed
his
eyes
for
ever
his
death
was
sincerely
deplored
by
all
the
poor
people
of
the
neighbourhood
some
time
after
the
two
brothers
sat
as
usual
in
the
high
of
godesberg
it
was
a
very
dismal
meal
for
they
sat
opposite
to
each
other
the
elder
with
reproachful
looks
the
younger
with
knitted
brows
i
only
took
what
the
ancient
law
of
my
fathers
bestowed
upon
me
said
the
elder
mildly
but
firmly
in
answer
to
some
harsh
words
of
his
companion
i
am
not
master
but
only
manager
of
the
family
possessions
all
our
ancestors
whose
pictures
look
down
on
us
in
this
hall
would
curse
me
if
i
did
not
take
good
care
of
their
legacy
but
you
my
dear
brother
will
receive
a
higher
gift
than
a
castle
you
the
offspring
of
a
noble
race
shall
become
a
worthy
servant
of
our
saviour
never
burst
forth
the
younger
one
in
passionate
eloquence
never
will
i
bow
my
neck
to
an
unjust
law
that
compels
one
to
take
up
arms
and
another
meekly
to
accept
a
monk
cassock
if
they
offered
me
now
a
bishop
ring
or
a
cardinal
hat
i
would
not
become
a
priest
i
shall
remain
a
knight
the
elder
brother
listened
sorrowfully
to
this
headstrong
speech
may
god
whom
you
thus
blaspheme
enlighten
your
dark
heart
i
would
willingly
share
with
you
whatever
i
possess
but
our
father
will
forbids
it
therefore
bend
your
proud
neck
humbly
and
beware
of
the
judgment
that
will
fall
on
him
who
despises
the
will
of
his
dying
father
hunting
horns
and
trumpets
sounded
through
the
green
forest
which
extended
at
that
time
from
the
town
of
godesberg
to
the
gates
of
bonn
this
huge
wood
abounded
in
noble
game
the
two
brothers
were
indulging
together
in
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
as
they
had
done
so
often
in
their
father
count
erich
had
gladly
accepted
his
brother
invitation
to
accompany
him
he
was
only
too
glad
to
see
how
his
dark
mood
had
changed
in
the
last
few
days
and
given
way
to
greater
cheerfulness
it
appeared
to
lord
erich
as
if
his
brother
had
come
to
reason
and
after
all
had
made
up
his
mind
to
fulfil
their
parents
wish
he
believed
all
the
more
in
the
happy
change
when
he
heard
that
his
brother
intended
presenting
himself
to
the
archbishop
of
cologne
in
order
to
deliver
a
letter
of
great
importance
from
his
late
father
to
him
count
erich
heart
was
glad
he
roamed
joyfully
through
the
forest
and
his
gladness
seemed
to
increase
his
good
luck
in
the
sport
several
gigantic
boars
were
pierced
through
by
a
spear
sent
from
his
hand
a
deer
also
met
with
a
similar
doom
the
younger
brother
success
was
on
the
contrary
very
meagre
his
hand
was
unsteady
and
his
whole
bearing
betrayed
restlessness
a
strange
subdued
fire
gleamed
in
his
eyes
while
he
was
following
the
trail
of
a
mighty
boar
count
erich
met
him
and
offered
to
pursue
the
animal
in
his
company
they
hunted
through
thorns
and
thicket
accompanied
by
the
yelping
hounds
suddenly
the
foliage
rustled
and
the
boar
was
seen
to
break
wildly
through
the
bushes
a
spear
from
the
younger
brother
whirred
towards
the
beast
but
missed
its
aim
and
remained
sticking
in
the
bark
of
an
oak
your
hand
is
more
fit
to
bless
pious
christians
said
count
erich
with
a
smile
but
still
fit
enough
to
rid
me
of
an
inconvenient
brother
muttered
the
younger
brother
between
his
teeth
and
tearing
his
hunting
knife
rapidly
from
his
belt
he
plunged
the
steel
into
his
brother
breast
a
terrible
cry
at
the
same
time
rang
through
the
forest
and
the
murderer
fled
in
haste
two
attendants
of
the
count
who
were
hunting
close
by
hearing
the
cry
came
running
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
found
lord
erich
lying
in
his
blood
dying
they
bent
down
over
him
to
see
if
they
could
help
him
but
alas
it
was
too
late
the
man
mortally
wounded
was
beyond
the
reach
of
human
aid
with
a
last
effort
he
opened
his
lips
muttered
lowly
but
audibly
the
words
my
brother
then
sank
back
and
closed
his
eyes
for
ever
the
terrible
news
that
the
lord
of
godesberg
had
been
foully
murdered
by
his
own
brother
spread
swiftly
through
the
country
mourning
again
filled
the
castle
on
the
mountain
when
they
carried
the
body
of
the
poor
slain
man
to
his
untimely
grave
they
buried
him
in
the
family
vault
next
to
the
recent
grave
of
his
father
from
that
time
the
castle
stood
desolate
the
next
relative
of
the
noble
family
who
lived
in
a
lovely
part
of
the
rhine
valley
near
the
palatinate
avoided
a
place
where
such
an
unheard
of
crime
had
been
committed
only
an
old
man
kept
watch
in
the
empty
castle
but
even
he
was
soon
compelled
to
leave
it
one
night
the
high
tower
was
struck
by
lightning
and
the
whole
building
burnt
down
nothing
remained
but
blackened
ruins
looking
mournfully
on
the
gay
landscape
beneath
years
went
by
after
this
crime
nobody
heard
or
saw
anything
of
the
murderer
he
seemed
to
have
totally
disappeared
some
people
however
whispered
that
on
the
day
of
the
black
deed
a
man
was
seen
fleeing
from
the
forest
of
godesberg
he
was
pale
and
ghastly
looking
and
darted
off
not
caring
which
way
he
went
it
was
he
who
on
the
previous
day
had
fostered
in
his
burning
brain
the
longing
desire
to
take
possession
of
his
brother
heritage
and
now
he
was
a
murderer
and
bore
cain
mark
on
his
forehead
the
unfortunate
youth
had
rashly
contrived
this
hellish
plan
to
rid
himself
of
his
brother
and
to
become
lord
of
godesberg
his
plan
was
to
kill
him
while
hunting
and
then
make
the
people
believe
that
he
had
aimed
at
a
boar
and
hit
his
brother
accidentally
instead
but
when
his
victim
sank
down
in
agony
the
knife
dropped
from
his
murderous
hand
his
courage
failed
him
and
he
felt
himself
driven
from
the
wood
as
if
chased
by
a
demon
after
many
years
had
come
and
gone
a
tired
wanderer
once
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
cloister
of
heisterbach
which
had
been
erected
by
benedict
pious
disciples
in
a
remote
valley
of
the
seven
mountains
the
man
who
desired
admission
looked
more
like
a
beggar
than
a
pilgrim
his
garments
hung
torn
and
ragged
round
his
thin
body
and
his
face
was
deeply
furrowed
by
marks
of
long
and
cruel
suffering
have
pity
on
me
said
he
in
a
trembling
voice
i
come
from
the
holy
sepulchre
my
feet
will
bear
me
no
further
the
was
moved
and
retired
to
inform
the
abbot
of
the
poor
man
request
he
received
permission
to
bring
him
in
when
the
beggar
appeared
before
the
abbot
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
renewed
his
demand
for
food
and
rest
for
some
moments
the
monk
looked
penetratingly
at
the
man
before
him
then
a
sign
of
recognition
passed
over
his
face
and
he
cried
out
good
heavens
is
it
you
sir
knight
the
pilgrim
trembled
prostrated
himself
before
the
abbot
and
embraced
his
knees
in
overwhelming
grief
have
mercy
on
me
exclaimed
he
it
was
i
who
twenty
years
ago
slew
my
brother
in
the
forest
of
godesberg
during
twenty
long
years
i
tried
to
atone
for
my
cursed
deed
and
obtain
forgiveness
and
peace
as
a
pilgrim
i
cried
for
mercy
at
the
grave
of
him
whom
i
murdered
as
a
slave
of
the
infidels
under
the
weight
of
heavy
chains
i
prayed
incessantly
for
god
mercy
but
i
can
not
find
peace
three
months
ago
the
fetters
were
struck
from
my
hands
and
i
have
again
come
home
weary
unto
death
you
oh
worthy
abbot
have
known
me
from
a
child
let
me
rest
within
the
walls
of
this
cloister
that
i
may
daily
see
the
castle
where
i
was
an
innocent
child
i
will
pray
and
do
penance
until
death
releases
me
from
my
wretched
life
the
abbot
felt
intense
pity
for
the
unhappy
man
he
bent
down
laid
his
hands
on
him
and
blessed
him
for
many
years
the
poor
penitent
remained
in
the
cloister
trying
to
atone
for
his
crime
with
fervent
prayers
and
hard
penance
at
last
god
in
his
grace
called
him
away
and
the
repenting
sinner
died
hopeful
of
heaven
forgiveness
the
monks
buried
him
in
a
shady
place
in
their
cloister
garden
bonn
lord
erich
pledge
on
the
klochterhof
at
friesdorf
near
bonn
a
nobleman
once
lived
who
was
well
known
in
the
whole
rhine
valley
as
a
great
tippler
once
lord
erich
had
indulged
with
great
relish
in
the
noble
sport
of
the
chase
in
the
forest
that
surrounded
the
neighbouring
town
of
godesberg
the
day
was
hot
the
chase
unsuccessful
and
rather
tedious
for
him
as
he
was
more
than
usually
tormented
by
a
mighty
thirst
the
sun
had
set
and
his
last
golden
rays
were
glittering
on
the
waves
of
the
rhine
when
lord
erich
shouldered
his
blunderbuss
and
turned
homeward
with
a
small
bag
consisting
of
one
fat
hare
in
those
days
one
small
inn
now
they
can
be
counted
by
the
dozen
stood
on
the
margin
of
the
large
forest
of
godesberg
there
lord
erich
entered
to
rest
his
tired
limbs
but
principally
to
quench
his
great
thirst
he
gave
the
hare
to
the
landlady
that
she
might
prepare
it
with
skilful
hands
and
ordered
a
flowing
bumper
of
golden
rhine
wine
which
he
emptied
at
one
deep
draught
i
am
sure
that
the
juice
of
the
grapes
must
have
been
far
better
then
than
it
is
the
landlady
soon
prepared
the
game
and
placed
the
tempting
meal
before
the
hungry
hunter
who
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
but
he
appreciated
still
more
the
delicious
cool
wine
offered
to
him
one
glass
after
the
other
was
swallowed
by
the
thirsty
lord
of
klochterhof
and
the
landlord
marked
just
as
many
charcoal
strokes
on
the
when
night
approached
the
noble
hunter
began
to
think
of
returning
home
sitting
there
had
been
agreeable
and
comfortable
but
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
get
up
and
walk
the
landlord
perceiving
his
guest
preparations
to
take
his
leave
came
forward
and
said
in
rather
a
rough
tone
being
an
outspoken
fellow
twelve
bottles
my
lord
do
forget
to
pay
before
you
go
lord
erich
who
was
standing
very
unsteadily
on
his
legs
muttered
in
a
thick
voice
but
very
dear
landlord
i
could
pay
you
if
i
had
loaded
my
blunderbuss
with
money
but
i
did
not
with
this
cheerful
response
he
turned
to
go
the
landlord
was
exceedingly
aggravated
at
this
careless
answer
his
face
grew
quite
purple
with
anger
if
you
have
no
money
my
lord
i
shall
keep
your
trousers
till
you
are
able
to
pay
for
the
twelve
bottles
so
saying
he
took
hold
of
the
tipsy
man
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
lord
erich
was
obliged
to
leave
his
inexpressibles
with
the
inexorable
landlord
and
to
walk
home
without
them
the
firs
in
the
wood
shook
their
heads
in
disapproval
at
such
a
strange
attire
it
is
not
known
if
lord
erich
ever
came
back
to
the
inn
to
redeem
his
nether
garments
the
roman
ghosts
before
the
gates
of
the
old
roman
town
of
bonn
rises
a
mountain
of
moderate
height
called
kreuzberg
or
crossmountain
in
early
mediaeval
times
pious
pilgrims
went
to
this
sacred
place
in
order
to
kneel
on
the
holy
steps
of
the
old
convent
church
so
rich
in
memories
of
the
martyrs
or
to
pray
in
the
chapel
on
the
same
spot
at
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
century
the
great
saints
of
the
theban
legion
cassius
and
his
companions
florentius
and
melusius
died
for
the
christian
faith
these
martyrs
were
the
guardian
saints
of
the
country
round
bonn
many
a
prayer
sent
up
to
them
had
graciously
been
fulfilled
since
the
time
when
helena
the
pious
mother
of
constantine
erected
a
chapel
to
their
honour
on
kreuzberg
once
upon
a
time
a
simple
peasant
from
the
neighbouring
country
went
on
a
pilgrimage
to
cassius
burial
place
he
came
to
ask
the
kind
martyr
for
assistance
in
his
distress
dransdorf
was
his
village
formerly
called
trajan
village
because
the
general
who
later
on
became
emperor
trajan
is
said
to
have
had
a
villa
there
a
bad
harvest
had
brought
troubles
on
the
peasant
but
he
firmly
believed
that
through
the
intercession
of
cassius
he
would
receive
money
enough
in
one
way
or
another
to
enable
him
to
pay
his
many
debts
on
arriving
at
kreuzberg
he
began
his
religious
exercises
by
confessing
his
sins
to
one
of
the
monks
belonging
to
the
order
of
francis
then
according
to
custom
he
knelt
in
succession
on
one
sacred
step
after
the
other
till
he
reached
the
chapel
his
wife
had
carefully
put
a
candle
in
his
pocket
which
he
now
lighted
before
the
image
of
cassius
having
thus
fulfilled
all
the
duties
prescribed
by
the
church
he
turned
homewards
well
content
with
himself
when
he
crossed
the
principal
square
of
the
town
where
already
at
the
time
the
magnificent
minster
stood
he
entered
this
church
to
pray
once
more
and
to
put
another
coin
into
the
twilight
was
creeping
through
the
aisles
and
a
pilgrimage
being
not
at
all
an
easy
thing
our
peasant
soon
fell
asleep
over
his
he
only
awoke
when
somebody
pulled
him
by
his
sleeve
it
was
the
sexton
with
a
big
bunch
of
keys
at
first
the
peasant
gazed
drowsily
at
the
unwelcome
intruder
then
with
astonished
eyes
he
looked
round
about
him
until
at
last
it
dawned
upon
him
that
he
must
get
up
and
leave
the
church
rousing
himself
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
left
the
minster
with
tottering
steps
the
night
winds
rustled
in
the
old
limetrees
of
the
square
and
seemed
to
whisper
strange
tales
into
the
ears
of
the
late
wanderer
the
peasant
crossed
the
open
space
sulkily
and
steered
his
way
towards
the
sternthor
which
led
to
dransdorf
an
ancient
roman
tower
the
remains
of
the
high
fortifications
erected
by
the
soldiers
of
drusus
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
stands
in
the
narrow
lane
leading
from
the
to
the
sternthor
to
the
tired
wanderer
this
tower
seemed
a
splendid
shelter
all
the
more
so
as
it
would
not
cost
him
a
penny
he
entered
it
and
tired
out
with
the
weary
day
he
was
soon
fast
asleep
as
if
he
had
never
been
stirred
up
from
the
bench
in
the
minster
no
sexton
with
noisy
keys
was
to
be
feared
and
yet
in
his
sleep
the
countryman
had
the
sensation
of
somebody
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
he
sat
up
and
looked
round
to
his
amazement
he
beheld
a
magnificent
warrior
standing
before
him
clad
in
a
coat
of
mail
with
a
roman
helmet
on
his
head
two
companions
in
similar
array
stood
by
his
side
they
nodded
genially
down
to
him
and
it
struck
him
that
he
had
already
seen
them
somewhere
else
after
some
moments
he
remembered
the
pictures
of
cassius
and
his
friends
in
the
chapel
on
kreuzberg
there
was
no
doubt
the
three
holy
martyrs
stood
in
person
before
him
our
good
peasant
was
so
much
awed
at
this
discovery
that
he
could
not
utter
a
word
but
on
a
sign
from
his
mysterious
visitors
he
followed
them
at
a
respectful
distance
they
marched
towards
the
sternthor
straight
into
the
building
the
walls
of
which
were
as
thick
as
the
rooms
were
long
in
the
humble
little
cottage
in
the
middle
of
a
high
vault
there
was
a
table
covered
with
sparkling
gold
at
this
unusual
sight
the
peasant
opened
his
eyes
very
widely
indeed
but
his
astonishment
changed
into
keen
delight
when
one
of
his
ghostly
visitors
filled
his
left
pocket
and
another
his
right
with
the
glittering
metal
meanwhile
the
third
man
took
a
tumbler
from
the
middle
of
the
table
and
presented
it
to
him
with
an
encouraging
smile
he
thought
their
language
was
very
much
like
that
which
the
vicar
of
the
village
church
used
in
reading
the
service
though
the
simple
man
could
not
understand
a
word
of
their
conversation
he
interpreted
the
kind
invitation
quite
correctly
and
shouting
out
a
merry
vivat
as
a
salute
to
his
hosts
he
emptied
the
tumbler
at
one
big
draught
the
whole
building
resounded
with
the
echo
vivat
the
three
warriors
looked
pleased
and
answered
in
a
cheerful
voice
vivat
vivat
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
the
peasant
as
if
the
vault
was
filled
with
a
multitude
of
roman
soldiers
who
all
called
out
to
him
vivat
as
if
happy
to
hear
a
sound
of
their
native
language
in
the
country
of
the
north
the
man
from
dransdorf
became
quite
and
kept
on
shouting
vivat
vivat
suddenly
startled
by
the
noise
he
made
he
awoke
and
found
himself
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
roman
tower
in
the
sterngasse
the
events
of
the
night
only
seemed
to
him
like
a
strange
dream
but
when
he
felt
in
his
pockets
he
found
them
stuffed
with
real
golden
coins
of
a
strange
ancient
stamp
our
friend
joy
became
quite
uproarious
after
having
sent
up
a
heartfelt
thanksgiving
to
cassius
he
gave
vent
to
his
delight
by
shouting
through
the
quiet
streets
at
the
top
of
his
voice
vivat
vivat
a
watchman
stood
on
duty
by
the
sternthor
when
the
jocund
peasant
passed
by
he
made
a
step
forward
and
reaching
out
his
arm
he
gave
the
merry
man
a
rude
knock
with
his
lance
unmindful
of
this
rough
admonition
the
peasant
related
the
event
in
the
roman
tower
to
the
watchman
and
finished
his
story
by
inviting
the
stern
man
of
duty
to
an
early
draught
at
the
nearest
inn
rumours
of
the
wonderful
events
spread
far
and
wide
and
soon
every
town
and
village
knew
the
tale
the
small
lane
leading
from
the
minstersquare
to
the
sternthor
was
called
vivat
lane
and
bears
that
name
to
the
present
day
some
years
ago
a
heavy
winter
gale
destroyed
the
old
roman
tower
that
had
so
long
withstood
the
vicissitudes
of
time
the
people
of
bonn
however
did
not
wish
to
obliterate
the
memory
of
this
curious
story
and
therefore
named
the
street
running
parallel
with
vivat
lane
cassius
graben
cologne
richmodis
of
aducht
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
shadows
of
death
hovered
above
the
holy
city
of
cologne
a
strange
figure
in
dark
garments
hurried
with
quick
steps
through
the
streets
and
lanes
it
was
the
plague
its
poisonous
breath
penetrated
into
cottages
and
palaces
extinguishing
the
lives
of
many
thousands
the
marked
innumerable
houses
with
a
black
cross
to
warn
the
that
the
destroying
angel
had
entered
there
the
roll
of
the
dead
rose
to
such
numbers
that
it
was
impossible
to
bury
them
all
in
the
customary
manner
therefore
the
bodies
of
the
unfortunate
people
were
thrown
together
into
a
common
grave
covered
only
scantily
with
earth
and
marked
with
a
plain
wooden
cross
woe
and
sorrow
thus
filled
the
old
city
of
cologne
on
the
close
to
the
church
of
the
apostles
in
a
splendid
mansion
the
rich
magistrate
mengis
of
aducht
lived
wealth
could
not
save
his
house
from
the
dreadful
epidemic
his
youthful
and
lovely
wife
richmodis
was
seized
with
the
plague
and
died
the
grief
of
her
lord
was
boundless
he
passed
the
whole
night
by
the
remains
of
his
beloved
spouse
dressed
her
himself
in
the
white
wedding
gown
she
had
worn
as
a
happy
bride
a
few
years
before
decorated
the
coffin
with
sweet
white
flowers
and
covered
her
with
the
precious
jewels
and
costly
rings
she
had
loved
so
much
then
she
was
buried
night
approached
and
the
clear
starry
sky
looked
peacefully
down
on
the
afflicted
town
perfect
stillness
prevailed
in
god
suddenly
a
jarring
sound
like
the
opening
of
an
old
rusty
lock
was
heard
and
two
dark
shadows
glided
among
the
graves
on
and
on
till
they
stopped
before
the
fresh
mound
which
enclosed
the
body
of
richmodis
of
those
two
knew
the
spot
and
well
they
might
for
they
were
the
and
had
prepared
this
grave
themselves
on
the
previous
day
they
were
present
when
the
lid
of
the
coffin
was
screwed
down
and
had
with
hungry
looks
coveted
the
glittering
precious
stones
richmodis
was
to
be
buried
with
now
they
had
come
to
rob
the
dead
body
with
spade
and
shovel
the
wreaths
and
flowers
were
quickly
removed
from
the
mound
the
earth
dug
up
and
the
coffin
laid
bare
in
feverish
haste
spurred
on
by
their
greed
they
burst
the
lid
open
and
the
dim
light
of
their
lantern
fell
full
on
the
mild
pale
face
of
the
dead
woman
with
haste
the
bolder
of
the
two
wretches
loosened
the
white
waxen
hands
folded
together
as
in
prayer
and
tried
to
tear
off
the
rings
suddenly
the
body
quivered
and
the
white
hands
spread
out
aghast
the
robbers
dropped
their
tools
scrambled
in
utmost
terror
out
of
the
grave
and
fled
as
if
chased
by
the
furies
a
painful
long
sigh
rose
from
the
depth
of
the
grave
and
after
some
time
the
white
form
of
richmodis
who
had
been
buried
alive
emerged
from
the
tomb
with
wide
open
eyes
full
of
horror
she
looked
down
into
the
ghastly
bed
she
had
just
could
it
really
be
true
or
was
it
only
a
frightful
dream
god
acre
was
silent
but
for
the
rustling
of
the
autumn
leaves
of
the
weeping
willows
stillness
of
death
everywhere
no
answer
came
to
her
faint
cry
for
the
horror
of
her
situation
however
wakened
her
declining
strength
she
took
up
the
lantern
which
the
robbers
had
left
behind
them
and
with
feeble
steps
reached
the
entrance
of
the
churchyard
the
streets
were
desolate
the
stars
overhead
alone
perceived
the
slowly
moving
form
every
now
and
then
resting
against
the
walls
of
the
at
last
she
reached
the
and
stood
before
the
door
of
her
home
dark
and
quiet
it
seemed
but
from
the
window
in
the
magistrate
room
a
faint
light
shone
forth
a
quiver
ran
through
the
frame
of
the
poor
wife
and
a
wild
longing
desire
seized
her
to
be
sheltered
by
his
loving
arms
and
to
feel
in
his
embrace
that
she
had
really
returned
to
life
again
with
a
last
effort
she
seized
the
knocker
and
listened
with
newly
awakened
hope
to
the
tapping
sound
which
rang
clear
through
the
night
a
few
minutes
elapsed
then
an
old
servant
peeping
out
of
the
window
in
the
door
perceived
the
white
ghostly
figure
of
his
late
mistress
horror
seized
him
his
hair
stood
on
end
richmodis
called
him
by
his
name
and
begged
him
to
open
the
door
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
old
man
started
ran
upstairs
dashed
into
his
master
room
uttering
incoherent
sounds
and
stammering
o
lord
the
dead
rise
outside
stands
our
good
mistress
and
demands
entrance
but
the
magistrate
shook
his
head
in
deep
grief
richmodis
my
beloved
wife
is
dead
and
will
never
return
never
never
he
repeated
in
unspeakable
sorrow
i
will
rather
believe
that
my
two
white
horses
will
burst
from
their
halters
in
the
stable
and
mount
the
stairs
to
the
tower
a
terrible
sound
suddenly
filled
the
quiet
house
a
noise
like
thunder
was
heard
and
mengis
of
aducht
and
his
servant
saw
the
two
white
steeds
tearing
and
tramping
in
haste
upstairs
a
moment
later
two
horses
looked
out
of
the
tower
windows
into
the
night
and
shortly
afterwards
the
magistrate
laughing
and
crying
with
joy
at
the
same
time
held
in
his
arms
his
wife
who
had
returned
from
the
grave
for
many
years
richmodis
lived
happily
with
her
husband
surrounded
by
several
lovely
children
deep
piety
remained
the
motive
power
of
richmodis
being
and
nobody
ever
saw
her
smile
again
if
you
come
to
cologne
reader
you
will
still
see
the
old
house
of
the
aduchts
at
the
with
two
white
wooden
horses
heads
looking
out
of
the
top
window
the
goblins
this
story
goes
back
to
the
good
old
times
of
which
we
modern
people
always
speak
with
a
sigh
of
regret
it
was
then
when
goblins
appeared
to
mortal
eyes
and
tried
to
render
the
life
of
the
troubled
human
race
a
little
more
cheerful
in
groves
and
dens
they
had
magnificent
dwellings
and
watched
there
over
the
enormous
mineral
treasures
of
the
earth
often
these
beneficent
elves
were
busy
miners
or
sometimes
clever
artisans
we
all
know
that
they
manufactured
the
precious
trinkets
and
arms
of
the
nibelungen
treasure
deep
in
the
interior
of
the
earth
they
lived
happily
together
ruled
over
by
a
king
they
could
be
called
the
harmless
friends
of
darkness
because
they
were
not
allowed
to
come
into
broad
daylight
if
they
did
so
they
were
transformed
into
stones
the
goblins
did
not
always
remain
underground
on
the
contrary
they
often
came
to
the
earth
surface
through
certain
holes
called
but
they
always
avoided
meeting
man
alas
the
advance
of
civilisation
has
driven
these
friendly
spirits
gradually
from
the
places
where
they
used
to
do
so
much
good
none
of
us
i
am
sure
has
ever
had
the
good
luck
of
meeting
one
of
them
the
goblins
were
of
different
sizes
sometimes
they
were
as
small
as
one
thumb
sometimes
as
large
as
the
hand
of
a
child
of
four
years
old
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
these
tiny
figures
was
the
enormous
head
and
the
pointed
hump
that
so
often
adorned
their
backs
their
look
was
on
the
whole
more
comical
than
ugly
german
people
used
to
call
them
heinzchen
or
heinzelmännchen
a
long
time
ago
the
good
town
of
cologne
was
inhabited
by
a
host
of
dwarfs
and
the
honest
population
knew
a
great
many
stories
about
them
the
workmen
and
artisans
especially
had
through
the
assistance
of
the
little
wights
far
more
holidays
than
are
marked
in
the
calendar
when
the
carpenters
for
instance
were
lying
on
their
benches
in
sweet
repose
those
little
men
came
swiftly
and
stealthily
along
they
took
up
the
tools
and
chiselled
and
sawed
and
hammered
with
a
will
and
thus
records
the
poetical
chronicles
which
i
am
quoting
before
the
carpenters
woke
up
the
house
stood
there
finished
in
the
same
way
things
went
on
with
the
baker
while
his
lads
were
snoring
the
little
goblins
came
to
help
they
groaned
under
the
load
of
heavy
they
kneaded
and
weighed
the
flour
lifted
and
pushed
the
bread
into
the
oven
and
before
the
lazy
bakers
opened
their
eyes
the
morning
bread
brown
and
crisp
was
lying
in
rows
on
the
table
the
butchers
too
could
speak
of
similar
agreeable
experiences
the
good
little
men
chopped
mixed
and
stirred
with
all
their
might
and
when
the
drowsy
butcher
opened
his
eyes
at
last
he
found
the
fresh
steaming
sausages
adorning
the
walls
of
his
shop
the
cooper
enjoyed
also
the
help
of
the
busy
dwarfs
and
even
the
tailor
could
not
complain
of
the
goblins
having
neglected
him
once
cotton
a
clever
tailor
had
the
honour
of
making
a
sunday
coat
for
the
mayor
of
the
town
he
worked
diligently
at
it
but
you
can
easily
imagine
that
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
afternoon
the
needle
soon
dropped
from
his
hand
and
he
fell
fast
asleep
hush
look
there
one
little
goblin
after
the
other
crept
cautiously
from
his
hiding
place
they
climbed
on
the
table
and
began
the
tailor
work
and
stitched
and
sewed
and
fitted
and
pressed
as
if
they
had
been
masters
of
the
needle
all
their
lives
when
master
cotton
awoke
he
found
to
his
great
joy
the
mayor
sunday
coat
ready
made
and
so
neatly
and
well
done
that
he
could
present
the
magnificent
garment
with
pride
to
the
head
of
the
town
the
pretty
wife
of
cotton
looked
at
this
masterpiece
of
her
husband
art
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
her
eyes
in
the
night
when
her
husband
had
fallen
asleep
she
rose
from
her
bed
without
making
the
slightest
noise
and
scattered
pease
all
over
the
floor
of
the
workshop
she
then
put
a
suit
on
the
table
she
kept
a
small
lantern
hidden
under
her
apron
and
waited
behind
the
door
listening
soon
after
the
room
was
full
of
little
men
all
tumbling
falling
and
slipping
over
the
pease
yells
and
screams
rose
at
the
same
time
the
poor
little
men
were
indeed
much
bruised
and
hurt
without
stopping
they
ran
downstairs
and
disappeared
the
tailor
wife
heard
the
noise
and
thought
it
good
sport
when
the
yells
were
loudest
she
suddenly
opened
the
door
to
see
her
visitors
but
she
came
too
late
not
a
single
goblin
was
left
behind
since
that
time
the
friendly
dwarfs
have
never
more
been
seen
in
cologne
and
in
other
places
also
they
have
entirely
disappeared

there
lived
at

on
the
old
farm
of
kümpchenshof
a
peasant
who
had
a
maid
called
griet
and
a
called
thus
begins
the
old
rhenish
song
of
jan
van

the
celebrated
general
of
the
imperial
cavalry
at
the
time
when
the
swedes
and
french
were
taking
advantage
of
the
civil
war
in
germany
but
nobody
except
the
inhabitants
of
the
holy
city
of
cologne
knows
that
jan
van
werth
was
originally
a
simple
labourer
and
that
he
was
indebted
for
his
luck
in
life
to
his
bad
luck
in
love
jan
was
an
industrious
with
an
upright
character
and
a
handsome
face
many
a

would
not

him
as
a

but
tender
heart
had
long
been
captivated
by
the
good
looks
of
pretty
griet
the
comely
maid
of
the
kümpchenshof
his
love
could
not
long
remain
a
secret
one
day
he
confessed
to
her
with
sobs
that
he
loved
her
dearly
and
would
with
pleasure
work
and
toil
for
her
twice
as
much
as
he
then
did
for
his
master
he
spoke
long
and
earnestly
and
taking
courage
with
every
word
he
uttered
he
at
last
put
to
her
the
question
would
she
become
his
wife
laughingly
the
pretty
girl
put
her
round
arms
akimbo
tossed
her
head
back
and
looked
at
her
honest
suitor
with
a
mocking
twinkle
in
her
eyes
then
she
shook
her
head
energetically
and
said
you
are
only
a
farmer
labourer
my
dear
boy
and
will
remain
one
most
probably
all
your
life
true
it
is
not
your
fault
but
all
the

i
should
prefer
to
marry
a
rich
farmer
with
cows
and
oxen
and
horses
bitter
anger
rose
in
jan
breast
on
hearing
her
talk
so
heartlessly
but
he
controlled
himself
just
as
you
like
he
said
sadly
and
turned
away
from
the
haughty
maid
from
that
day
he
could
not
endure
any
longer
the
life
at
the
farm
and
pocketing
his
wages
he
said
for
ever
to
the
kümpchenshof
and
became
a
soldier
it
was
a
furious
war
in
which
the
german
emperor
was
engaged
against
the
enemies
of
his
country
and
brave
soldiers
were
rare
any
valiant
warrior
might
distinguish
himself
and
become
an
officer
at
that
time
the

won
by
his
bravery
and
intrepidity
the
esteem
of
his
superiors
and
was
promoted
to

he
showed
such
determination
and
courage
that
he
won

after
this
brilliant
act

french
in
a
skirmish
at
tüttlingen
in
another
way
also
his
good
luck
reconciled
him
to
the
first
bitter
disappointment
caused
for
by
griet
scornful
answer
he
married
a
lovely
and
noble
young
lady
who
was
very
proud
of
becoming
the
wife
of
such
a
celebrated
general
let
us
now
look
back
and
see
what
happened
in
the
meantime
to
griet
she
had
waited
month
after
month
and
year
after
year
for
the
rich
farmer
but
the
suitor
never
made
his
appearance
even
in
those
days
red
cheeks
and
bright
eyes
were
much
less
thought
of
than
ducats
and
glittering
gold
as
time
went
on
griet
grew
old
and
though
she
would
now
have
been
content
with
a
simple
man
for
her
sweetheart
not
even
such
a
one
condescended
to
ask
her
to
become
his
wife
little
by
little
griet
gave
up
all
hopes
of
ever
marrying
and
had
to
look
out
for
a
living
to
keep
her
in
her
old
age
from
starving
therefore
she
started
a
fruit
stall
at
one
of
the
large
gateways
of
cologne
one
day
the
good
inhabitants
of
this
town
were
in
great
excitement
and
crowded
in
their
best
round
the
gate
of
severin
where
griet
sat
at
her
they
had
come
to
meet
jan
van
werth
the
celebrated
general
who
was
returning
victorious
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
there
he
was
sitting
on
a
powerful
charger
which
was
gorgeously
covered
with
gilded
trappings
on
his
fine
head
jan
wore
a
hat
with
a
flowing
feather
behind
him
rode
his
splendid
soldiers
the
of
the
town
beat
the
drum
enthusiastically
and
the
cologne
people
called
out
long
live
our
jan
van
werth
when
the
celebrated
general
passed
the
gate
he
stopped
his
horse
just
in
front
of
griet
apple
baskets
and
looking
down
upon
the
old
wrinkled
woman
met
her
questioning
glance
with
an
odd
smile
ah
griet
said
he
slowly
whoever
would
have
thought
it
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
an
expression
of
sudden
recognition
passed
over
her
worn
features
and
she
muttered
sorrowfully
but
still
audibly
to
the
proud
rider
oh
jan
if
i
had
only
known
it
a
magnificent
monument
in
the
form
of
the
statue
of
jan
van
werth
now
stands
in
the
centre
of
the
old
market
of
cologne
it
was
erected
there
in
memory
not
only
of
the
heroic
deeds
of
the
brave
general
but
also
as
a
warning
to
all
cologne
maidens
not
to
reject
their
suitors
because
they
are
poor
for
one
day
like
jan
van
werth
they
may
become
famous
and
then
they
will
not
like
griet
have
to
sigh
over
things
that
might
have
been
the
of
cologne
it
was
at
cologne
in
the
year
on
the
eve
of
the
ascension
day
of
our
lord
before
the
mighty
archbishop
kunrad
of
hochstaden
stood
a
simple
architect
offering
the
plan
of
a
church
and
arrogantly
boasting
that
it
would
become
one
of
the
most
beautiful
cathedrals
in
christendom
that
man
was
master
gerhard
of
ryle
the
archbishop
was
greatly
astonished
at
the
grandeur
of
the
design
and
ordered
the
execution
of
the
bold
plan
without
delay
on
the
square
which
was
selected
for
the
erection
of
the
new
cathedral
another
church
had
once
been
standing
under
the
reign
of
the
first
king
of
the
franks
but
it
had
been
destroyed
by
the
normans
now
again
gigantic
masonry
slender
pillars
bold
vaults
and
arches
rose
to
unite
into
a
proud
dome
everybody
admired
the
humble
man
whose
creative
genius
now
employed
thousands
of
industrious
workmen
and
master
gerhard
name
was
mentioned
with
great
praise
at
home
and
abroad
when
the
choir
was
finished
crowds
of
pious
pilgrims
came
from
the
surrounding
suburbs
and
even
from
a
distance
to
pray
before
the
relics
of
the
three
holy
kings
which
where
enshrined
there
hymns
of
praise
through
the
unfinished
aisles
everybody
rejoiced
but
he
who
ought
to
have
been
the
most
glad
was
sad
and
dark
forebodings
damped
his
spirits
the
question
if
after
all
he
would
live
to
see
his
proud
building
finished
or
if
cruel
fate
would
tear
him
away
before
he
should
have
tasted
the
sweetness
of
triumph
tormented
him
day
and
night
his
young
wife
saw
with
grief
the
change
in
his
disposition
but
she
tried
in
vain
by
tender
words
and
caresses
to
smooth
his
sorrowful
brow
the
more
he
was
troubled
by
his
gloomy
thoughts
the
more
he
urged
his
workmen
four
years
had
elapsed
it
was
now
the
tower
on
the
north
side
rose
already
proudly
into
the
air
the
scaffolding
reached
higher
and
higher
every
day
one
day
master
gerhard
stood
beside
the
big
crane
watching
how
the
gigantic
blocks
of
stone
taken
from
the
quarries
at
the
drachenfels
were
lifted
up
he
thought
with
pride
and
satisfaction
that
his
work
was
going
on
well
and
that
he
surely
would
see
it
finished
while
thus
meditating
he
did
not
observe
that
a
stranger
stood
by
his
side
watching
him
with
an
ugly
sneer
a
burning
red
cloak
hung
round
his
tall
figure
a
gold
chain
glittered
on
his
breast
and
a
feather
nodded
from
a
quaint
velvet
cap
he
introduced
himself
to
the
somewhat
surprised
builder
as
a
you
are
building
a
lovely
church
he
then
said
but
i
created
a
far
more
magnificent
mansion
long
long
years
ago
its
stone
will
never
crumble
to
dust
and
it
will
resist
the
influence
of
time
and
weather
forever
in
saying
this
his
eyes
glittered
strangely
under
his
shaggy
brows
this
presumptuous
speech
did
not
please
master
gerhard
and
without
answering
he
measured
the
bold
speaker
scornfully
from
head
to
foot
your
church
continued
the
stranger
will
be
a
very
lovely
building
but
do
you
think
that
such
an
enterprise
is
far
too
audacious
for
mortal
man
you
master
gerhard
you
ought
to
have
known
at
the
time
when
you
laid
the
foundation
stone
of
your
church
that
you
never
would
see
your
work
finished
who
is
likely
to
prevent
it
angrily
burst
forth
the
builder
no
one
had
ever
dared
to
use
such
language
towards
him
nor
to
wound
his
pride
so
keenly
death
coolly
replied
the
stranger
never
cried
master
gerhard
in
a
great
fury
i
will
finish
what
i
began
and
would
even
bet
with
the
devil
himself
to
do
so
hallo
laughed
the
stranger
grimly
i
should
like
to
deal
with
such
an
audacious
man
as
you
and
make
bold
to
bet
with
you
that
i
will
in
a
shorter
space
of
time
finish
the
digging
of
a
canal
from
treves
to
cologne
fill
it
with
water
and
have
merry
ducks
swimming
on
it
than
you
will
take
to
complete
your
church
so
be
it
said
master
gerhard
very
much
startled
taking
the
outstretched
hand
of
the
strange
man
at
the
touch
of
his
cold
fingers
a
sensation
of
horror
crept
into
the
heart
of
master
gerhard
but
the
man
burst
into
a
yelling
laugh
and
cried
out
in
a
formidable
voice
remember
we
betted
for
your
soul
utmost
terror
seized
the
trembling
architect
cold
perspiration
stood
on
his
brow
and
he
tried
in
vain
to
utter
a
word
suddenly
a
storm
rose
the
stranger
unfolded
his
red
cloak
and
was
lifted
from
the
ground
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
vanished
from
that
day
the
mind
of
master
gerhard
grew
more
and
more
gloomy
he
kept
on
wandering
restlessly
on
the
scaffoldings
of
the
building
the
more
he
considered
the
huge
dimensions
of
the
cathedral
the
more
doubtful
he
felt
as
to
whether
he
would
be
able
to
finish
it
or
not
by
daybreak
he
could
be
seen
among
his
workmen
and
till
late
in
the
evening
he
wandered
about
on
the
praising
the
industrious
and
blaming
the
idle
he
looked
out
anxiously
sometimes
in
the
direction
of
treves
to
see
if
he
could
discern
anything
uncommon
there
but
he
never
saw
the
slightest
change
nor
any
sign
that
the
stranger
with
whom
he
had
betted
had
really
begun
his
canal
in
earnest
and
he
looked
more
hopefully
into
the
future
one
day
he
was
standing
as
usual
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
completed
towers
when
he
felt
a
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
turning
round
he
beheld
with
disagreeable
surprise
the
ghostly
stranger
was
he
a
master
of
the
black
art
or
was
he
the
devil
himself
well
master
gerhard
began
the
unwelcome
visitor
how
are
you
getting
on
with
your
work
i
see
it
is
making
good
progress
happily
i
shall
soon
have
finished
my
canal
else
i
should
run
the
risk
of
losing
my
bet
i
can
scarcely
believe
your
boasting
speech
answered
the
builder
scornfully
because
i
do
not
perceive
the
slightest
trace
of
your
having
begun
the
canal
know
my
dear
man
that
i
am
worth
more
than
a
hundred
workmen
together
and
as
i
told
you
my
work
is
nearly
ready
said
the
man
in
red
really
said
master
gerhard
a
little
startled
i
should
like
to
know
what
magic
power
could
enable
you
to
do
so
come
and
follow
me
replied
the
stranger
taking
the
builder
by
the
hand
off
they
flew
through
the
air
with
the
quickness
of
lightning
and
reached
the
earth
in
the
district
near
treves
in
a
few
seconds
at
the
place
where
they
descended
a
spring
arose
from
the
ground
and
sent
its
crystal
waters
into
an
opening
in
a
rock
come
with
me
said
the
magic
stranger
and
bending
down
he
disappeared
in
this
opening
master
gerhard
followed
him
and
came
into
a
high
glittering
grotto
where
he
perceived
that
the
water
gushed
tumultuously
into
the
mouth
of
a
black
underground
channel
you
see
said
the
stranger
how
well
i
have
used
my
time
if
you
have
the
heart
for
it
we
will
follow
the
waters
and
see
how
far
my
canal
reaches
already
scarcely
had
he
uttered
these
words
than
a
mysterious
power
seized
both
and
pushed
them
forward
with
tremendous
rapidity
master
gerhard
saw
now
with
terror
that
the
work
of
the
evil
one
was
indeed
not
far
from
its
completion
for
when
they
emerged
from
the
dark
canal
they
had
the
city
of
cologne
lying
close
before
them
the
could
no
longer
doubt
the
great
skill
of
his
rival
and
he
felt
sure
that
he
would
lose
his
bet
the
man
seemed
to
take
great
delight
in
the
builder
discomfiture
and
he
said
with
an
ugly
grin
well
master
gerhard
i
see
you
have
found
more
than
you
expected
i
am
sure
you
would
like
to
see
the
merry
ducks
which
shall
swim
on
my
brook
according
to
our
bet
he
clapped
his
hands
three
times
and
then
listened
some
minutes
passed
but
no
ducks
appeared
the
stranger
face
assumed
an
expression
of
rage
when
he
found
his
summons
unsuccessful
he
tried
again
but
in
vain
after
this
he
gave
a
frightful
yell
and
vanished
all
at
once
leaving
nothing
behind
him
but
a
smell
of
sulphur
the
had
looked
on
in
wonder
and
new
hope
began
to
fill
his
heart
that
after
all
he
could
win
the
bet
i
know
well
why
the
ducks
wo
appear
thought
he
but
i
shall
never
betray
my
secret
to
him
after
this
adventurous
journey
master
gerhard
was
a
prey
to
melancholy
he
was
seen
oftener
than
before
on
the
building
ground
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
doubt
any
longer
that
the
stranger
with
whom
he
had
made
the
fatal
bet
was
the
devil
himself
the
unfortunate
man
was
well
aware
that
not
only
was
his
life
at
stake
but
that
the
salvation
of
his
soul
was
likewise
in
danger
should
the
master
of
hell
carry
out
his
work
there
was
only
one
little
hope
left
for
him
namely
that
the
devil
would
be
unable
to
find
out
how
to
keep
the
ducks
alive
while
they
were
swimming
through
the
long
underground
channel
so
master
gerhard
took
courage
saying
to
himself
he
can
not
win
and
i
know
why
his
young
wife
was
strangely
moved
at
her
husband
silence
and
melancholy
she
tried
by
increased
tenderness
and
love
to
unstop
his
silent
lips
and
to
make
him
tell
what
was
lying
so
heavily
on
his
heart
he
appreciated
her
endeavours
to
cheer
him
very
much
but
could
not
be
brought
to
tell
of
his
dealings
with
the
evil
one
and
so
he
kept
his
secrets
to
himself
one
day
not
long
after
the
mysterious
journey
of
master
gerhard
a
stranger
apparently
a
scholar
entered
the
architect
house
while
he
was
as
usual
on
the
building
ground
a
scarlet
cloak
enveloped
his
tall
figure
and
a
cock
feather
sat
boldly
on
his
black
cap
his
manners
were
soft
and
in
general
those
of
a
gentleman
hearing
that
the
builder
was
not
at
home
he
asked
for
his
wife
she
came
and
soon
found
that
she
liked
talking
to
him
because
he
showed
not
only
great
eloquence
but
also
great
sympathy
for
her
husband
involuntarily
she
disclosed
to
the
kind
stranger
her
secret
grief
about
master
gerhard
sadness
the
scholar
listened
to
her
troubles
with
great
attention
and
seemed
to
feel
for
her
in
her
sorrow
my
dear
mistress
said
he
in
a
soft
voice
there
is
surely
some
secret
weighing
heavily
on
his
mind
and
this
and
nothing
else
is
the
cause
of
his
melancholy
unless
we
know
it
we
can
not
cure
him
you
are
nearest
to
his
heart
if
you
are
very
loving
and
tender
to
him
he
will
not
withhold
the
secret
for
long
from
you
be
extremely
kind
to
him
after
three
days
i
shall
come
back
to
see
if
you
have
been
successful
if
not
i
will
give
you
a
remedy
that
will
unfailingly
make
him
tell
you
his
inmost
thoughts
thus
speaking
he
took
his
leave
and
she
was
unable
to
find
words
to
express
her
gratitude
for
three
days
she
tried
the
scholar
advice
but
found
that
her
husband
in
spite
of
all
her
coaxing
and
caresses
would
not
tell
the
cause
of
his
melancholy
on
the
fourth
day
the
scholar
called
again
and
heard
with
apparent
grief
how
badly
her
endeavours
had
succeeded
i
pity
you
heartily
said
he
but
do
despair
here
is
a
wonderful
herb
prepare
a
beverage
with
it
for
your
husband
and
make
him
drink
it
before
he
goes
to
sleep
he
will
dream
after
the
draught
and
betray
his
secrets
in
his
sleep
she
accepted
the
gift
gratefully
and
prepared
the
potion
according
to
his
advice
her
husband
took
the
beverage
willingly
and
soon
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
after
some
time
dreams
seemed
to
trouble
him
he
tossed
restlessly
to
and
fro
in
his
bed
murmuring
incoherent
words
his
wife
listened
anxiously
and
heard
in
feverish
excitement
about
the
terrible
dealings
between
him
and
the
devil
after
a
pause
master
gerhard
muttered
he
will
never
win
because
i
hold
the
secret
what
may
that
be
whispered
she
in
the
dreamer
ear
he
may
do
what
he
will
unconsciously
answered
he
it
is
quite
impossible
that
ducks
should
swim
through
the
underground
channel
unless
he
makes
at
every
mile
of
course
this
idea
will
never
come
into
his
head
the
next
morning
the
scholar
called
upon
the
wife
and
heard
how
well
his
scheme
had
succeeded
she
told
him
every
thing
when
she
had
revealed
her
husband
secret
to
him
the
meek
features
of
her
strange
guest
suddenly
changed
he
gave
a
loud
shrill
scream
of
joy
and
disappeared
the
poor
wife
remained
on
the
same
spot
pale
and
master
gerhard
was
standing
the
next
day
by
the
high
crane
of
the
cathedral
as
usual
the
air
was
sultry
and
black
clouds
were
gathering
from
across
the
rhine
he
felt
very
restless
and
urged
his
workmen
even
more
than
before
to
hurry
on
the
builder
heart
was
strangely
filled
with
dark
forebodings
all
at
once
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
turning
round
he
beheld
with
terror
the
fatal
stranger
a
wondrous
gleam
of
flames
seemed
to
radiate
all
round
his
figure
the
cathedral
builder
grew
pale
as
death
and
trembled
from
head
to
foot
he
was
unable
to
utter
a
word
beaming
with
the
joy
of
triumph
the
evil
one
pointed
with
his
hand
downwards
and
forced
master
gerhard
to
look
in
the
same
direction
behold
at
the
foot
of
the
cathedral
a
silvery
brook
was
visible
running
from
the
direction
of
treves
merry
ducks
were
swimming
on
its
shining
surface
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
feelings
of
the
builder
at
the
sight
of
the
completed
work
of
his
rival
despair
and
agony
made
his
heart
sink
within
him
but
the
evil
one
looked
with
joy
on
his
victim
when
he
suddenly
tried
to
grasp
him
master
gerhard
darted
to
the
edge
of
the
scaffolding
with
a
scream
and
dashed
himself
down
into
the
depth
below
and
was
instantly
killed
a
roar
of
thunder
filled
the
air
at
that
moment
and
the
devil
vanished
in
a
blaze
of
lightning
the
thunderstorm
grew
more
and
more
violent
after
a
few
minutes
the
unhappy
cathedral
builder
house
was
struck
by
lightning
and
burnt
to
ashes
in
less
than
an
hour
unfortunately
the
admirable
plan
of
the
splendid
church
was
also
destroyed
this
was
the
sad
end
of
master
gerhard
and
his
ambition
the
cathedral
remained
untouched
for
more
than
six
centuries
after
its
unfinished
walls
and
towers
began
to
decay
as
if
they
mourned
the
terrible
death
of
their
builder
the
cologne
people
believed
for
a
long
time
that
the
spirit
of
master
gerhard
used
to
hover
about
midnight
round
the
high
towers
and
the
desolated
vaults
strange
sounds
like
the
sighs
of
somebody
in
anguish
were
often
heard
in
the
deserted
building
and
people
said
it
was
master
gerhard
ghost
complaining
that
his
proud
cathedral
remained
unfinished
generation
after
generation
passed
by
and
six
centuries
elapsed
before
busy
workmen
began
again
hammering
and
building
on
the
ground
which
had
lain
so
long
quiet
in
the
dome
was
finished
and
towers
now
in
all
its
majesty
high
above
the
dwellings
of
the
people
and
can
be
seen
miles
away
since
that
glorious
day
when
the
last
stone
was
added
to
the
cathedral
of
cologne
master
gerhard
ghost
has
never
been
heard
or
seen
again

glorious
name
the

at
us
with
shining
eyes
for

not
siegfried
the
perfect
embodiment
of
all
that
was
beautiful
and
good
for
centuries
stories
have
been
told
and
poems
have
been
sung
of
the
bold
adventures
of
the
young
hero
whose
energy
only
found
satisfaction
in
victorious
fights
the
original
name
of
the
small
town
on
the
lower
rhine
now
called
xanten
was
ad
santos
peace
for
the
saints
it
was
thus
named
on
account
of
the
pious
warriors
of
the
theban
legion
who
in
the
fourth
century
had
boldly
died
there
for
their
creed
under
their
leader
victor
at
the
time
to
which
our
story
refers
a
mighty
stronghold
formed
the
centre
of
the
little
town
xanten
a
king
called
siegmund
with
his
wife
siegelinde
and
their
son
siegfried
lived
there
while
a
mere
boy
siegfried
had
already
a
kingly
stature
and
an
almost
untamable
disposition
of
mind
when
he
was
only
thirteen
years
of
age
his
longing
for
grand
deeds
was
so
great
that
he
found
it
impossible
to
remain
inactive
at
home
from
old
songs
and
legends
which
the
minstrels
recited
in
his
father
castle
he
had
heard
so
much
of
bold
adventures
and
brilliant
exploits
performed
by
his
forefathers
that
he
was
most
anxious
to
follow
in
their
steps
he
felt
strong
and
valiant
enough
to
undertake
like
the
heroes
of
old
dangerous
journeys
therefore
young
siegfried
left
one
day
his
ancestral
halls
and
wandered
southwards
along
the
clear
blue
river
he
soon
found
an
opportunity
of
testing
his
courage
at
the
foot
of
the
seven
mountains
lived
a
celebrated
armourer
called
mimer
renowned
for
making
excellent
swords
our
hero
liked
this
warlike
trade
and
he
asked
the
master
to
receive
him
as
an
apprentice
that
he
might
learn
the
praiseworthy
art
of
forging
a
good
sword
for
himself
the
armourer
agreed
and
siegfried
remained
at
mimer
workshop
the
journeymen
with
whom
the
youth
had
to
work
soon
learned
the
enormous
strength
of
their
new
companion
the
boy
often
not
knowing
how
to
give
expression
to
his
desire
for
action
would
take
up
his
lift
them
high
into
the
air
and
drop
them
not
always
softly
to
the
ground
or
when
his
anger
was
roused
he
would
imprint
black
and
blue
marks
on
their
backs
with
his
strong
fists
once
he
even
smashed
with
one
stroke
of
his
hammer
all
the
iron
bars
in
the
armoury
and
knocked
the
anvil
into
the
ground
with
a
mighty
blow
mimer
looked
on
with
dismay
amazed
at
the
boy
almost
supernatural
strength
but
fearing
that
siegfried
wrath
might
some
time
turn
against
him
he
thought
to
rid
himself
of
his
dangerous
apprentice
and
conceived
a
cunning
plan
to
kill
him
a
horrible
dragon
lived
in
the
neighbouring
forest
which
tore
every
wanderer
to
pieces
who
chanced
to
cross
its
way
mimer
ordered
siegfried
to
fetch
a
sack
from
the
in
that
forest
well
knowing
that
the
boy
would
never
return
thence
the
youth
without
knowing
the
danger
he
was
about
to
meet
went
cheerfully
on
his
way
in
the
middle
of
the
thick
wood
he
kindled
a
and
amused
himself
by
putting
big
burning
branches
and
young
trees
into
the
fire
suddenly
the
monster
came
swiftly
creeping
on
its
huge
claws
curving
its
shimmering
body
the
ugly
beast
opened
wide
its
jaws
to
devour
the
young
siegfried
eyes
brightened
up
at
the
prospect
of
an
encounter
with
the
terrible
animal
before
him
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
tore
a
flaming
beam
out
of
the
kiln
and
pushed
its
burning
end
deep
into
the
open
mouth
of
the
dragon
roaring
with
pain
the
monster
turned
round
beating
violently
with
its
prickly
tail
trying
in
its
agony
to
crush
siegfried
but
he
jumping
skilfully
aside
rapidly
dealt
it
heavy
blows
and
succeeded
at
last
in
smashing
its
head
with
a
large
piece
of
rock
he
severed
the
head
from
the
body
and
threw
it
into
the
blazing
flames
to
his
astonishment
he
observed
how
a
stream
of
grease
gushed
from
the
burning
pile
and
collected
in
a
pool
at
his
feet
close
by
the
stood
an
old
limetree
a
little
bird
sang
merrily
in
its
branches
siegfried
involuntarily
listening
to
the
clear
strain
made
out
the
following
words
if
you
would
be
covered
with
horn
and
become
invulnerable
undress
yourself
and
plunge
into
the
pool
siegfried
quickly
threw
his
clothes
off
and
anointed
his
whole
body
with
the
dragon
grease
while
thus
occupied
a
leaf
from
the
old
limetree
above
dropped
between
his
shoulders
this
part
of
the
body
remained
without
horn
when
he
had
finished
he
took
up
the
monster
head
and
returned
to
mimer
workshop
the
nearer
he
got
to
the
smithy
the
more
his
rage
against
his
wicked
master
increased
mimer
had
seen
the
boy
from
afar
approaching
with
the
trophy
of
his
fight
and
had
hidden
in
great
fear
siegfried
however
soon
found
him
out
and
slew
him
on
the
spot
then
he
forged
a
good
sword
and
shining
armour
for
himself
and
having
saddled
the
best
horse
of
mimer
stable
he
left
the
smithy
to
look
for
new
adventures
for
a
long
time
he
travelled
aimlessly
about
saw
mountains
and
valleys
rivers
and
lakes
cities
and
hamlets
until
he
at
last
arrived
at
the
he
embarked
with
his
good
horse
and
was
cast
by
a
gale
on
the
rocky
coast
of
an
unknown
country
the
noble
animal
climbed
courageously
up
the
stony
beach
and
carried
its
rider
to
an
enchanted
castle
which
was
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
flames
for
a
moment
siegfried
stood
irresolute
suddenly
the
voice
of
the
little
bird
sounded
again
above
him
break
the
charm
straight
into
the
flames
with
a
bold
dash
a
most
lovely
maiden
will
be
thy
reward
the
youth
took
courage
spurred
his
steed
and
with
a
plunge
horse
and
rider
disappeared
in
the
flames
which
were
at
once
extinguished
the
charm
was
broken
before
him
lay
a
wonderful
castle
siegfried
penetrated
into
its
interior
and
was
amazed
to
find
every
living
creature
in
a
profound
sleep
within
the
horses
in
their
stalls
the
grooms
in
the
stables
the
cook
at
the
hearth
when
he
entered
the
high
hall
a
lovely
scene
presented
itself
to
his
view
on
a
couch
the
most
exquisite
form
of
a
woman
lay
sleeping
her
golden
hair
was
strewn
with
precious
stones
and
her
limbs
were
clothed
in
the
most
costly
garments
the
young
hero
looked
for
a
while
lost
in
admiration
then
bending
down
to
her
he
pressed
a
passionate
kiss
on
her
rosy
lips
brunhilde
the
fair
sleeper
opened
her
eyes
and
at
the
same
time
every
living
being
in
the
castle
awoke
the
old
legend
depicts
in
glowing
colours
the
sweet
hours
of
love
that
followed
for
siegfried
and
brunhilde
days
and
months
passed
by
without
the
lovers
being
aware
of
it
however
fond
of
adventures
siegfried
was
he
felt
himself
chained
to
the
spot
by
her
subtle
charms
while
thus
undecided
he
heard
one
day
the
bird
voice
leave
the
castle
and
give
up
a
life
of
ignoble
leisure
direct
your
steps
towards
the
country
of
the
nibelungen
take
possession
of
their
immense
treasures
and
of
the
precious
invisible
cap
at
the
prospect
of
new
adventures
siegfried
could
not
be
kept
back
any
longer
by
brunhilde
they
parted
with
the
solemn
promise
of
meeting
again
a
great
many
exploits
are
recorded
of
the
proud
hero
which
he
performed
in
the
country
of
the
nibelungen
after
a
long
and
hard
struggle
with
the
cunning
dwarfs
he
took
away
with
him
their
treasure
as
well
as
the
cap
which
had
the
gift
of
making
its
wearer
invisible
years
had
passed
by
and
siegfried
longed
to
see
the
place
of
his
childhood
again
so
he
turned
homewards
and
reached
xanten
after
many
adventures
the
joy
of
his
noble
parents
at
seeing
their
valiant
son
again
was
indescribable
the
legend
of
siegfried
youthful
exploits
and
his
is
full
of
romance
and
happiness
but
if
we
listen
to
the
continuation
of
his
story
we
shall
find
how
every
human
feeling
has
its
place
in
the
hero
biography
great
joy
deep
sorrow
passionate
love
glowing
hatred
heroism
and
perfidy
cowardice
and
high
courage
until
at

of
siegfried
ends

wail

grief

with

the
legend
of

long
centuries
ago
deep
sorrow
brooded
over
the
walls
of
the
castle
at
cleve
its
mistress
the
duchess
elsa
was
in
great
distress
her
beloved
husband
had
died
and
his
remains
had
been
brought
to
their
last
as
soon
as
the
tomb
had
closed
over
them
one
of
the
late
duke
vassals
telramund
rose
in
revolt
and
imperiously
claimed
the
right
to
reign
over
the
dukedom
the
audacious
man
went
so
far
as
to
ask
the
widowed
duchess
to
become
his
wife
declaring
that
this
was
the
only
means
of
saving
her
rank
which
the
death
of
her
husband
had
deprived
her
of
elsa
the
youthful
and
lovely
mistress
implored
the
knights
of
her
dominion
to
assist
her
in
her
trouble
and
to
take
up
arms
against
the
rebel
but
telramund
little
disconcerted
by
this
appeal
offered
to
fight
in
single
combat
with
anybody
who
dared
to
take
up
the
quarrel
with
him
well
knowing
that
on
account
of
his
immense
strength
nobody
would
dare
to
become
his
adversary
the
days
passed
in
deepest
sorrow
for
the
unfortunate
duchess
the
moment
was
approaching
when
the
rebel
would
make
bold
to
proclaim
openly
his
claims
before
the
whole
assembled
nobility
on
the
open
space
before
the
castle
the
fatal
hour
came
pale
her
face
covered
by
her
widow
veil
her
queenly
form
enveloped
in
mourning
garments
elsa
descended
from
her
castle
to
the
assembly
the
large
plain
was
crowded
with
a
throng
of
people
and
glittered
with
the
brilliant
armour
of
the
knights
the
unfaithful
vassal
covered
from
head
to
foot
in
shining
armour
came
forward
with
bold
steps
and
claimed
in
a
loud
voice
the
hand
and
dominion
of
the
duchess
the
knights
around
deluded
by
his
valiant
appearance
and
the
firmness
of
his
voice
broke
into
loud
applause
some
of
the
crowd
joined
them
in
their
cry
of
approbation
but
most
of
the
people
looked
on
full
of
pity
and
admiration
for
their
youthful
mistress
no
answer
to
his
first
challenge
having
come
telramund
repeated
his
audacious
demand
offering
again
to
fight
in
single
combat
anybody
who
dared
to
accept
it
his
eyes
glanced
defiantly
over
the
brilliant
multitude
of
knights
he
perceived
with
triumphant
joy
how
they
all
shrank
from
fighting
with
elsa
looked
still
paler
than
before
for
a
third
time
the
challenge
of
telramund
was
heard
it
sounded
clearly
over
the
whole
plain
but
none
of
the
bright
warriors
came
forward
to
take
up
the
combat
for
elsa
sake
on
the
contrary
deep
silence
followed
the
third
challenge
and
everybody
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
forsaken
princess
who
looked
in
her
abandoned
position
still
more
lovely
the
little
hope
that
had
till
that
moment
given
her
strength
to
bear
her
misfortune
had
now
entirely
vanished
in
her
utter
desolation
she
offered
a
fervent
prayer
to
heaven
on
her
rosary
so
the
legend
records
a
little
silver
bell
was
hanging
which
possessed
the
wonderful
gift
of
giving
forth
whenever
slightly
touched
a
clear
ringing
sound
audible
even
at
a
great
distance
in
praying
to
god
for
deliverance
from
her
great
trouble
she
pressed
the
cross
on
her
rosary
fervently
to
her
lips
the
silver
bell
tinkled
and
at
the
same
moment
a
little
barge
suddenly
appeared
on
the
blue
river
when
it
came
nearer
everybody
looked
with
astonishment
at
the
strange
vessel
its
form
was
light
and
graceful
but
what
astonished
the
people
most
was
that
it
was
not
moved
by
either
oar
or
rudder
but
was
gently
gliding
on
the
blue
waves
drawn
by
a
swan
in
the
middle
of
the
vessel
stood
a
knight
in
shining
silver
armour
long
golden
locks
emerged
from
under
his
glittering
helmet
his
bright
blue
eyes
looked
boldly
over
the
crowd
on
the
shore
and
his
hand
held
the
hilt
of
his
broad
sword
firmly
the
strange
boat
stopped
just
opposite
the
plain
where
the
people
stood
motionless
with
amazement
the
knight
landed
from
the
barge
giving
a
sign
with
his
hand
to
the
swan
which
swam
gently
down
the
rhine
in
silence
and
awe
the
multitude
made
room
for
the
stranger
who
approached
with
firm
steps
towards
the
middle
of
the
brilliant
circle
and
saluted
the
assembly
with
a
solemn
grace
then
he
bent
his
knees
before
the
duchess
and
rising
turned
towards
telramund
challenging
him
proudly
to
fight
with
him
for
the
hand
and
dominion
of
elsa
of
brabant
the
bold
rebel
temerity
seemed
to
fail
him
for
a
few
moments
but
gathering
fresh
courage
he
pulled
his
sword
from
its
sheath
with
a
loud
scornful
laugh
the
next
moment
the
two
knights
darted
at
each
other
their
blades
clashing
in
rapid
strokes
the
whole
crowd
looked
with
wonder
and
amazement
at
the
strange
knight
great
prowess
he
parried
the
blows
of
his
strong
adversary
skilfully
the
combat
lasted
for
some
time
and
neither
of
the
fighters
seemed
to
give
way
suddenly
a
subdued
cry
was
heard
and
at
the
same
time
the
presumptuous
vassal
sank
to
the
ground
pierced
by
the
sword
of
him
whom
god
had
sent
and
expired
a
tremendous
shout
of
joy
burst
from
the
gazing
crowd
which
rang
from
one
end
of
the
plain
to
the
other
and
was
echoed
by
the
glittering
waves
of
the
rhine
the
people
rejoiced
in
the
victory
and
thought
that
god
himself
had
decided
the
combat
in
favour
of
elsa
the
duchess
felt
greatly
moved
in
her
overflowing
gratitude
she
sank
down
before
her
deliverer
with
tears
in
her
eyes
but
he
bade
her
rise
and
bowing
low
before
her
asked
her
to
become
his
wife
she
consented
what
a
heaven
of
bliss
opened
for
the
duchess
of
brabant
all
her
former
troubles
were
forgotten
her
gratitude
towards
her
rescuer
was
transformed
into
passionate
love
to
which
lohengrin
the
virtuous
knight
responded
with
tender
adoration
yet
though
everything
seemed
now
so
serene
in
the
life
of
the
duchess
there
was
a
dim
cloud
which
threatened
to
darken
the
clear
prospect
of
her
happiness
on
their
elsa
had
to
promise
her
bridegroom
that
she
would
never
inquire
about
his
name
his
home
or
his
descent
trusting
her
deliverer
honour
and
chivalrous
bearing
she
took
the
strange
oath
without
a
moment
hesitation
many
years
of
bliss
and
happiness
passed
and
elsa
of
brabant
had
strictly
kept
the
promise
she
had
made
on
her
bridal
morning
their
happiness
was
still
more
enhanced
by
the
birth
of
three
hopeful
boys
they
were
their
parents
joy
and
promised
to
become
in
future
shining
ornaments
of
knighthood
it
happened
however
when
the
eyes
of
the
duchess
were
resting
with
pride
on
her
sons
that
her
mother
heart
thought
with
grief
of
the
solemn
oath
she
had
sworn
on
her
with
how
much
more
pride
would
she
have
looked
upon
her
sons
if
she
could
have
known
them
to
be
the
offspring
of
a
high
and
noble
race
she
did
not
doubt
however
that
her
beloved
husband
lineage
was
a
most
noble
one
yet
the
thought
that
his
sons
might
never
bear
their
father
name
nor
be
able
to
add
new
glories
to
it
was
lying
heavily
on
her
mind
and
darkened
the
radiant
image
of
her
husband
that
like
a
deity
filled
her
whole
soul
the
fatal
question
she
had
for
so
long
withheld
burst
one
day
forcibly
from
her
lips
when
she
had
pronounced
the
awful
words
the
proud
hero
grew
pale
and
freeing
himself
softly
from
her
tender
embrace
he
cried
out
in
bitter
grief
woe
to
thee
my
beloved
wife
and
woe
also
to
me
now
that
thou
hast
uttered
the
question
thou
didst
sware
solemnly
never
to
ask
our
happiness
is
gone
for
ever
i
must
part
from
thee
never
to
see
thee
again
a
cry
of
anguish
rose
from
her
lips
but
she
was
unable
to
keep
him
back
waving
his
hand
to
her
in
a
mute
farewell
her
noble
husband
left
the
castle
he
went
to
the
rhine
and
blew
his
silver
horn
its
sound
was
echoed
from
the
shore
like
a
long
sob
the
white
swan
with
the
boat
soon
appeared
gliding
gently
over
the
river
lohengrin
stepped
into
the
boat
and
soon
vanished
out
of
sight
and
was
seen
no
more
his
unhappy
wife
was
inconsolable
her
grief
was
so
intense
that
a
short
time
after
her
health
gave
way
and
she
sank
into
a
premature
grave
her
sons
became
the
ancestors
of
a
noble
and
distinguished
race
in
the
rhenish
country
their
badge
is
a
swan
the
traveller
who
visits
cleve
will
still
find
a
tombstone
in
its
church
with
a
knight
carved
on
it
and
a
swan
sitting
at
his
feet

a
strange
story
is
still
told
about
the
city
of
stavoren
on
the
zuydersea
it
was
a
wondrous
town
but
like
vineta
on
the
baltic
sea
it
vanished
from
the
earth
the
merchants
of
stavoren
were
the
rulers
of
the
ocean
and
the
treasures
of
all
known
countries
were
lying
in
their
port
the
houses
were
lovely
palaces
furnished
in
their
interior
like
the
marvellous
abodes
of
the
sultan
haroun
al
rachid
in
the
arabian
nights
of
all
the
wealthy
people
of
the
town
there
was
nobody
so
much
blessed
with
riches
as
richberta
a
proud
and
beautiful
lady
smiling
fortune
had
lavishly
poured
its
gifts
upon
her
and
threw
fresh
treasures
daily
at
her
feet
she
seemed
to
own
everything
beautiful
that
this
life
can
bestow
but
one
thing
she
did
not
possess
and
that
was
the
soft
fire
of
woman
kindness
which
lightens
and
warms
the
soul
and
throws
on
all
its
surroundings
a
mild
reflecting
gleam
richberta
was
cold
and
indifferent
to
either
the
pleasures
or
sorrows
of
her
when
night
casts
her
shades
upon
the
earth
all
the
sweet
bright
birds
and
butterflies
hide
and
make
room
for
a
host
of
ghastly
animals
like
owls
and
bats
so
in
richberta
soul
all
her
soft
qualities
had
gone
to
sleep
for
want
of
the
tender
gleam
of
love
and
only
dark
and
harsh
feelings
haunted
her
soul
immense
pride
in
her
own
wealth
a
bitter
envy
towards
those
who
possessed
more
than
she
did
were
her
ruling
passions
once
richberta
gave
a
grand
feast
while
the
luxurious
meal
was
being
served
a
stranger
entered
who
had
come
from
far
away
to
see
the
wonders
of
stavoren
with
his
own
eyes
i
have
seen
said
he
bowing
low
to
the
lovely
hostess
many
countries
and
many
a
princely
court
but
i
confess
that
stavoren
surpasses
them
all
in
splendour
highly
flattered
the
proud
lady
bade
him
welcome
to
her
table
according
to
the
customs
of
the
orient
whence
he
came
he
begged
for
some
bread
and
salt
richberta
ordered
her
servants
to
bring
both
but
it
was
useless
to
look
for
such
simple
fare
in
her
house
where
only
the
most
luxurious
food
was
to
be
had
without
making
any
remarks
however
the
stranger
sat
down
and
partook
of
the
costly
dishes
then
he
began
to
relate
his
journeys
his
success
and
his
failures
in
life
and
dwelt
with
great
eloquence
on
the
instability
of
earthly
fortunes
all
the
guests
listened
with
interest
to
what
he
said
only
richberta
sat
gloomily
at
the
head
of
her
table
she
felt
angry
that
the
stranger
dared
in
her
very
presence
to
find
fault
with
wealth
and
splendour
and
to
predict
its
probable
destruction
moreover
she
thought
it
rude
in
him
that
he
had
no
word
of
praise
for
her
own
brilliant
beauty
nor
a
glance
of
astonishment
for
her
gorgeous
palace
her
offended
vanity
induced
her
at
last
to
force
from
him
the
praise
he
so
obstinately
withheld
o
gracious
lady
said
he
rather
reluctantly
marvellous
indeed
is
your
home
and
fit
for
a
queen
if
you
travelled
far
and
near
you
could
not
find
its
equal
but
my
lady
among
your
treasures
i
miss
one
thing
and
that
is
the
noblest
that
the
earth
produces
richberta
was
very
anxious
to
learn
what
it
was
that
she
might
get
it
and
entreated
her
guest
to
name
the
precious
thing
but
he
avoided
any
direct
answer
to
her
impetuous
questions
and
soon
afterwards
took
his
leave
under
a
slight
pretext
on
the
open
sea
a
proud
fleet
was
sailing
its
commander
strange
to
say
did
not
himself
know
the
aim
of
his
journey
his
mistress
richberta
of
stavoren
had
directed
him
to
travel
to
all
parts
of
the
world
to
find
out
and
bring
home
the
most
costly
treasure
according
to
her
command
he
set
out
cruised
the
ocean
to
the
east
and
to
the
west
and
searched
everywhere
for
the
unknown
gift
in
doing
so
it
happened
one
day
that
seawater
spoiled
a
part
of
the
provisions
of
one
of
the
ships
it
was
the
flour
and
bread
the
want
of
which
was
keenly
felt
by
the
whole
crew
in
this
necessity
the
captain
saw
clearly
that
neither
gold
nor
pearls
could
outweigh
the
value
of
bread
and
the
meaning
of
the
mysterious
words
the
stranger
from
the
orient
had
spoken
to
richberta
dawned
upon
him
he
steered
to
the
coast
and
took
a
large
cargo
of
the
finest
wheat
aboard
his
ships
full
of
joy
at
having
at
last
found
what
he
deemed
the
most
costly
thing
on
earth
he
sailed
towards
stavoren
where
he
arrived
safely
when
richberta
learned
of
the
common
merchandise
her
captain
had
brought
home
she
summoned
him
before
her
and
asked
him
contemptuously
on
which
side
of
the
vessel
has
the
cargo
of
corn
been
taken
in
on
the
right
mistress
answered
the
faithful
servant
doubtful
of
what
she
meant
then
continued
she
coldly
throw
it
from
the
left
into
the
sea
again
the
day
after
the
return
of
the
fleet
an
animated
scene
was
witnessed
in
the
port
of
stavoren
the
numerous
poor
people
of
the
town
on
hearing
of
the
wicked
command
of
richberta
had
come
to
beg
of
her
not
to
spoil
the
precious
wheat
but
to
divide
it
among
those
who
were
so
much
in
want
of
it
the
proud
lady
appeared
herself
to
see
that
her
will
was
executed
it
was
a
touching
spectacle
to
see
how
the
crowd
of
miserable
women
and
children
surrounded
the
noble
lady
in
her
costly
garments
the
sight
of
so
much
misery
would
have
moved
many
a
cold
heart
but
richberta
showed
no
pity
she
moved
forward
impatiently
as
if
she
heard
not
the
supplications
but
the
crowd
of
women
stopped
her
they
fell
on
their
knees
and
entreated
her
with
uplifted
hands
and
tears
in
their
eyes
for
the
preservation
of
god
precious
gift
richberta
heard
but
remained
unrelenting
her
command
was
fulfilled
and
the
golden
wheat
was
thrown
into
the
sea
a
storm
of
reproaches
rose
from
the
poor
on
the
shore
and
many
a
mother
prayed
to
god
on
her
knees
to
revenge
this
wickedness
the
curses
of
the
hungry
people
were
fulfilled
far
sooner
than
they
expected
in
the
same
year
innumerable
earless
blades
of
wheat
rose
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
like
a
forest
catching
up
mud
mire
weed
and
remains
of
animals
so
that
by
and
by
a
dune
rose
under
water
which
stopped
the
ships
from
entering
the
port
of
stavoren
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
who
had
principally
lived
by
commerce
suddenly
found
the
source
of
their
wealth
stopped
want
and
poverty
took
possession
of
the
once
rich
city
richberta
in
whom
everybody
recognised
the
author
of
this
misfortune
lost
everything
in
the
general
impoverishment
and
was
driven
by
the
enraged
populace
from
the
town
the
once
proud
and
rich
lady
had
now
to
beg
for
her
bread
she
walked
wearily
from
village
to
village
curses
following
her
wherever
she
went
she
died
in
utter
destitution
the
sea
that
had
for
so
many
years
been
the
blessing
of
stavoren
was
now
the
destruction
of
the
voluptuous
city
one
night
it
rose
with
immense
power
against
the
dunes
burst
through
them
and
flooding
the
town
with
huge
waves
buried
it
forever
to
this
day
the
fishermen
on
the
zuydersea
relate
the
story
of
the
wonderful
sunken
city
that
once
towered
high
into
the
air
when
the
water
is
clear
they
imagine
they
can
see
the
high
steeples
of
stavoren
churches
and
the
towers
of
her
palaces
shimmering
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
