chapter
i
in
which
he
vows
a
vow
there
comes
the
green
how
can
you
tell
do
you
hear
red
coming
in
on
five
cylinders
for
all
he
can
get
out
of
anybody
else
would
stop
and
fix
up
he
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
as
the
green
imp
tore
past
the
porch
where
burns
neighbours
waved
arms
of
greeting
which
he
failed
to
see
for
he
did
not
turn
his
head
the
car
went
round
the
curve
of
the
driveway
at
perilous
speed
and
only
the
fact
that
from
road
to
old
red
barn
was
a
good
twenty
rods
made
it
seem
possible
that
the
green
imp
could
come
to
a
standstill
in
time
to
prevent
its
banging
into
the
rear
wall
of
the
barn
two
minutes
later
burns
ran
by
the
chesters
porch
on
his
way
to
his
own
chester
hailed
him
what
your
everlasting
hurry
red
come
up
and
sit
down
and
cool
not
now
called
back
a
voice
curtly
out
of
the
june
twilight
the
big
figure
ran
on
and
disappeared
into
the
small
house
the
door
slamming
shut
behind
it
red
in
a
temper
tell
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
is
he
ever
in
anything
except
a
temper
inquired
a
guest
of
the
chesters
arthur
chester
turned
on
her
show
you
do
know
him
much
pauline
he
the
owner
of
the
fiercest
good
disposition
ever
heard
of
he
the
pepperest
proposition
of
an
angel
this
earth
has
ever
seen
he
a
brute
of
a
saint
why
arthur
chester
he
a
pot
of
mustard
that
clear
balm
if
you
do
mind
getting
stung
when
it
well
of
all
the
i
going
over
to
get
something
for
this
abominable
headache
and
incidentally
to
find
out
what
the
row
he
probably
lost
a
patient
it
always
goes
to
his
brain
like
that
when
he
abuses
his
beloved
engine
that
way
it
because
some
other
machinery
has
stopped
if
he
lost
a
patient
you
better
let
him
alone
dear
advised
his
wife
winifred
no
he
needs
to
get
his
mind
off
it
on
me
i
can
fix
up
a
few
symptoms
for
he
see
through
you
called
chester
softly
after
him
no
doubt
of
that
but
it
may
divert
him
just
the
chester
made
his
way
across
the
lawn
and
in
at
the
side
door
which
led
to
the
dimly
lighted
village
offices
of
redfield
pepper
burns
physician
and
surgeon
not
that
the
sign
on
the
glass
of
the
office
door
read
that
way
r
burns
was
the
brief
inscription
above
the
table
of
office
hours
and
the
owner
of
the
name
invariably
so
curtailed
it
but
among
his
friends
the
full
name
had
inevitably
been
turned
into
the
nickname
for
the
big
fellow
was
red
pepper
burns
as
irresistibly
to
them
as
he
had
been
a
decade
earlier
to
his
classmates
in
college
as
chester
went
in
at
the
door
a
figure
arose
slowly
from
its
position
flung
full
length
face
downward
on
a
couch
in
the
shadowy
inner
office
and
came
into
view
toothache
dentist
down
the
street
said
a
blurred
voice
unsympathetically
chester
laughed
oh
come
red
said
he
give
me
some
of
that
headache
dope
i
all
glad
to
hear
it
you
do
get
any
more
from
why
not
i
got
a
headache
i
did
come
over
to
quiz
you
the
blamed
thing
whizzes
like
a
buzz
ca
help
it
go
soak
chester
advanced
i
get
the
powders
myself
then
i
know
the
a
substantial
barrier
interposed
no
you
do
you
taken
up
six
ounces
of
that
stuff
do
seven
days
you
quit
look
here
red
what
the
use
of
taking
it
out
on
me
like
that
if
you
are
mad
at
something
if
your
head
i
wish
it
did
ache
like
ten
thousand
furies
it
might
take
some
of
the
pressure
off
somewhere
else
growled
burns
he
shut
the
door
of
the
inner
office
hard
behind
him
i
thought
so
declared
arthur
chester
suddenly
forgetting
about
his
headache
in
his
anxiety
to
know
the
explanation
of
the
five
cylinders
it
was
a
small
suburban
town
in
which
they
lived
and
if
something
had
gone
wrong
it
was
a
matter
of
common
interest
can
you
tell
me
about
it
he
asked
a
little
diffidently
for
none
knew
better
than
he
that
things
could
not
always
be
told
and
that
no
lips
were
locked
tighter
than
red
pepper
when
the
secret
was
not
his
to
tell
engine
on
the
blink
got
to
go
out
and
fix
it
was
the
unpromising
reply
burns
picked
up
a
sparkplug
from
the
office
desk
as
he
spoke
had
your
dinner
do
want
shall
i
go
out
with
you
the
answer
was
an
unintelligible
grunt
as
chester
was
about
to
follow
his
friend
out
for
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
red
pepper
burns
was
his
friend
in
spite
of
this
somewhat
surly
though
by
no
means
unusual
treatment
another
door
opened
tentatively
and
a
head
was
cautiously
inserted
your
dinner
ready
doctor
burns
said
a
doubtful
voice
burns
turned
leave
a
pitcher
of
milk
on
the
table
for
me
cynthia
he
said
in
a
gentler
voice
than
chester
had
yet
heard
from
him
tonight
crisp
though
it
was
nothing
chester
catching
a
glimpse
of
a
brightly
lighted
and
a
table
lavishly
spread
undertook
to
remonstrate
he
had
seen
the
housekeeper
disappointed
face
also
but
burns
cut
him
short
come
along
if
you
must
said
he
and
stalked
out
into
the
night
for
an
hour
in
the
light
from
one
of
the
green
imp
lamps
chester
sat
on
an
overturned
box
and
watched
burns
work
he
worked
savagely
as
if
applying
surgical
measures
to
a
mood
as
well
as
to
a
machine
he
worked
like
a
skilled
mechanic
as
well
every
turn
of
a
nut
every
polish
of
a
thread
meaning
definite
means
to
an
end
the
night
was
hot
and
he
had
thrown
off
coat
and
collar
and
rolled
his
sleeves
high
so
a
brawny
arm
gleamed
in
the
bright
lamplight
and
the
open
shirt
exposed
a
powerful
neck
chester
who
was
of
slighter
build
and
not
as
tall
as
he
would
have
liked
to
be
watched
enviously
whatever
goes
wrong
with
your
affairs
red
he
observed
suddenly
breaking
a
long
interval
during
which
the
engine
had
been
made
to
throb
and
whirl
like
the
ten
thousand
furies
to
whom
its
engineer
had
lately
made
allusion
you
have
the
tremendous
asset
of
a
magnificent
body
to
fall
back
on
for
with
a
movement
of
the
hand
burns
stopped
his
engine
now
running
quietly
and
stood
up
straight
he
threw
out
one
bare
arm
grimy
and
oily
with
his
labours
two
hours
ago
said
he
in
a
voice
now
controlled
and
solemn
if
by
cutting
off
that
right
arm
at
the
shoulder
i
could
have
saved
a
human
life
i
have
done
and
now
retorted
chester
quickly
now
two
hours
after
would
you
cut
it
off
now
red
pepper
looked
at
him
the
arm
dropped
no
said
he
i
would
not
for
a
dozen
lives
like
that
i
not
heroic
after
all
only
hot
and
cold
by
jumps
like
a
thermometer
but
i
ache
all
over
just
the
same
she
runs
like
a
bird
now
jump
in
we
take
a
spin
and
try
her
out
on
the
road
i
may
need
her
before
nothing
loth
for
he
knew
the
green
imp
and
her
driver
and
had
had
many
a
swift
run
on
a
moonlight
night
before
in
the
same
company
chester
took
the
slim
roadster
other
seat
watching
the
long
green
hood
point
the
way
down
the
driveway
past
the
porch
where
the
women
in
white
gowns
showing
coolly
in
the
light
from
the
arc
lamp
at
the
corner
of
the
street
called
a
goodbye
back
some
time
replied
chester
voice
rising
above
the
low
purr
of
the
engine
with
a
note
of
satisfaction
in
it
the
figure
beside
him
still
in
open
white
shirt
with
bare
arms
and
uncovered
thick
thatch
of
red
hair
did
not
turn
its
head
arthur
never
so
happy
as
when
he
out
with
red
in
the
green
imp
winifred
said
to
her
guest
as
the
roadster
shot
away
under
the
elms
which
drooped
beneath
the
arc
light
doctor
burns
is
certainly
the
oddest
man
i
ever
saw
replied
the
guest
swinging
idly
in
the
hammock
and
watching
the
car
out
of
sight
down
the
long
vista
of
the
village
street
he
has
given
me
one
real
good
look
yet
i
suppose
if
i
were
a
patient
he
would
favour
me
with
an
gaze
out
of
those
barbarian
eyes
of
his
but
as
it
is
her
voice
was
slightly
petulant
i
believe
i
shall
have
to
do
as
arthur
has
make
up
some
symptoms
and
go
over
to
his
if
you
do
you
get
precisely
the
same
treatment
i
presume
arthur
chester
laughed
as
she
spoke
i
doubt
very
much
whether
he
comes
back
with
any
headache
but
he
got
a
moonlight
ride
in
that
beauty
of
a
car
the
guest
declared
enviously
that
treatment
would
suit
me
wonderfully
well
whatever
was
the
would
you
have
gone
with
him
in
his
he
plainly
in
a
mood
i
think
a
drive
in
the
moonlight
with
a
of
a
saint
in
with
arms
like
those
might
be
interesting
mused
the
guest
indicating
invisible
patterns
on
the
porch
with
the
toe
of
a
white
slipper
he
would
probably
talk
cars
and
engines
every
mile
in
the
most
way
winifred
chester
assured
her
no
woman
yet
has
ever
been
able
as
far
as
this
town
knows
to
strike
a
spark
of
romance
out
of
red
pepper
yet
he
has
red
hair
murmured
the
guest
to
herself
and
continued
to
look
thoughtfully
down
the
street
along
which
the
green
imp
had
shot
out
toward
the
open
country
beyond
out
in
that
open
country
miles
away
the
car
running
with
that
exquisite
precision
of
rotating
cylinder
explosions
which
is
music
to
the
trained
ear
of
the
mechanic
at
the
wheel
the
two
men
sat
silent
the
pace
of
the
green
imp
was
one
to
cut
off
speech
for
the
road
wets
straight
and
empty
stretching
like
a
white
ribbon
under
the
stars
with
now
and
then
a
band
of
midnight
shade
crossing
it
where
arching
met
the
course
which
invites
an
open
throttle
and
the
intent
eye
which
goes
with
it
suddenly
the
car
struck
aside
from
the
straightaway
and
with
open
roared
up
a
steep
hill
by
means
of
which
a
narrow
road
led
off
toward
a
part
of
the
country
not
often
selected
by
motorists
for
pleasure
spins
chester
recognized
that
his
companion
had
a
purpose
beyond
that
of
trying
out
his
engine
unless
indeed
the
tough
and
rocky
grade
were
a
test
but
burns
was
still
silent
and
the
other
man
applied
himself
to
holding
on
a
mile
up
the
road
the
car
came
to
an
abrupt
standstill
before
a
tiny
house
going
to
make
a
call
after
all
was
on
chester
lips
but
the
sight
of
something
showing
white
beside
the
door
in
the
lamplight
which
streamed
out
upon
a
small
decrepit
porch
drove
back
the
words
burns
left
a
silent
engine
and
strode
up
the
straggling
path
with
the
light
tread
of
the
heavy
man
whose
muscles
are
under
his
control
he
walked
in
at
the
open
door
without
knocking
and
chester
caught
the
sharp
sound
of
a
woman
voice
at
a
tension
saying
oh
doctor
it
seemed
to
him
an
hour
though
by
his
watch
it
was
but
nine
minutes
that
he
sat
watching
the
little
flimsy
streamer
of
white
flutter
to
and
fro
in
the
lamplight
his
heart
beating
heavily
as
a
father
will
at
sight
of
the
sign
of
some
other
man
loss
at
the
end
of
those
interminable
nine
minutes
burns
was
back
again
in
the
car
he
turned
the
green
imp
about
as
quietly
as
if
she
were
a
cat
stealing
out
of
the
yard
and
sent
her
down
the
rocky
road
at
her
slowest
speed
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
he
broke
the
long
silence
could
have
slept
an
hour
if
i
had
come
back
he
said
in
a
low
tone
back
and
apologized
for
being
a
brute
it
eased
me
up
a
bit
i
think
it
eased
her
too
poor
then
it
was
losing
the
case
chester
began
doubtfully
he
was
never
sure
just
when
it
was
safe
to
ask
red
pepper
questions
but
he
thought
it
seemed
safer
than
usual
now
no
it
was
losing
the
case
though
that
was
bad
enough
it
was
losing
my
infernal
of
a
temper
that
been
cutting
in
like
a
knife
i
had
the
boy
where
he
ought
to
get
well
if
they
followed
my
precautions
a
thousand
times
repeated
this
morning
his
heart
was
a
whole
lot
stronger
it
only
needed
time
tonight
his
mother
let
him
sit
up
in
spite
of
all
i
threatened
her
with
if
she
did
he
went
out
like
a
snuffed
candle
when
i
saw
it
i
was
so
angry
with
her
i
he
thrust
up
one
hand
and
ran
it
through
his
thick
locks
with
a
gesture
of
savagery
i
let
loose
on
her
poor
soul
with
her
heart
already
broken
he
was
the
only
boy
of
course
i
ought
to
have
been
shot
on
the
he
sent
the
car
flying
down
the
road
chester
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
he
could
imagine
the
sort
of
apology
red
had
given
the
mother
one
to
make
her
forgive
and
adore
him
no
doubt
it
had
eased
it
must
have
been
a
hard
thing
for
burns
to
do
suddenly
recalling
this
he
said
so
and
added
a
word
of
admiration
burns
turned
on
him
boy
he
said
i
the
toughest
case
on
my
list
i
a
chronic
patient
just
as
i
think
i
have
myself
in
hand
i
suffer
a
relapse
i
break
out
in
a
new
place
of
all
men
who
need
a
surgeon
needs
it
most
sometimes
i
in
too
much
of
a
temper
to
operate
just
because
a
nurse
has
failed
to
provide
the
right
sutures
every
red
hair
on
my
head
stands
up
like
a
porcupine
quills
my
hand
is
steady
i
ca
trust
my
own
judgment
till
i
cooled
down
there
only
one
hope
for
me
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
the
green
imp
accelerated
her
pace
as
they
came
to
the
long
straight
road
home
until
they
reached
the
turn
under
the
elms
which
led
to
the
town
he
left
the
sentence
unfinished
while
chester
waited
chester
felt
it
would
be
worth
waiting
for
that
which
red
pepper
might
say
next
when
it
came
it
surprised
him
it
even
gave
him
a
strange
thrill
coming
from
red
pepper
i
put
my
case
into
the
only
competent
hands
said
burns
slowly
and
quite
simply
i
promised
my
maker
i
never
insult
his
name
chapter
ii
in
which
he
creates
a
circus
doctor
burns
yes
miss
the
telephone
burns
excused
himself
to
the
last
patient
of
the
evening
series
and
shut
himself
in
with
the
when
he
came
out
he
was
looking
at
his
watch
from
its
face
he
turned
to
that
of
his
office
nurse
the
one
hardly
less
businesslike
in
expression
than
the
other
miss
mathewson
my
aunt
telephones
that
my
father
and
mother
are
both
sick
each
anxious
to
distraction
about
the
other
she
about
them
both
and
under
the
weather
herself
if
you
and
i
can
catch
the
we
can
be
there

in
the
morning

twenty
minutes
to
get
very
well
doctor
the
office
bell
rang
burns
fled
toward
the
inner
office
miss
mathewson
discovered
the
guest
of
the
chesters
on
the
doorstep
all
in
white
with
a
face
which
usually
stimulated
interest
wherever
it
was
seen
may
i
see
doctor
burns
just
a
minute
for
chester
the
caller
took
her
cue
cleverly
from
miss
mathewson
face
which
at
the
moment
expressed
schedules
and
engagements
thick
as
blackberries
in
august
burns
just
closing
the
inner
door
caught
chester
name
he
pulled
off
his
white
office
coat
slid
into
his
gray
tweed
one
and
opened
the
door
what
can
i
do
for
chester
in
three
minutes
he
inquired
coming
forward
miss
mathewson
aware
of
the
shortness
of
time
vanished
give
me
something
for
his
headache
please
replied
the
young
person
in
white
promptly
schedules
and
engagements
were
in
burns
eyes
also
they
looked
at
her
without
appearing
to
see
her
at
all
to
this
she
was
not
accustomed
and
it
displeased
her
was
it
too
severe
for
him
to
come
himself
much
too
severe
he
has
gone
to
bed
with
mrs
chester
closely
attending
him
certainly
or
i
should
be
the
eyes
of
the
chesters
guest
sparkled
something
about
the
cool
tone
of
this
question
displeased
her
still
more
tell
him
to
get
up
and
go
out
and
walk
a
mile
breathing
deep
all
the
no
medicine
not
a
grain
he
ought
to
know
better
than
to
he
does
i
think
he
suggested
that
possibly
if
i
asked
but
i
see
for
myself
how
that
would
make
the
slightest
i
glad
your
perceptions
are
so
acute
replied
burns
gravely
are
the
three
minutes
up
asked
the
caller
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
think
not
quite
is
there
anything
of
importance
to
fill
the
one
remaining
nothing
whatever
except
to
mention
your
the
guest
receded
gracefully
from
the
door
if
the
patient
will
follow
directions
i
ask
no
fee
if
he
i
exact
one
when
i
see
him
again
forgive
my
haste
miss
halstead
hempstead
corrected
the
caller
crisply
do
mention
it
doctor
brown
good
the
chesters
guest
lingered
on
the
porch
before
going
in
to
report
the
failure
of
her
mission
she
was
still
lingering
there
when
the
green
imp
carrying
no
mechanic
but
a
properly
clothed
professional
gentleman
and
a
severely
dressed
professional
lady
whirled
away
down
the
drive
he
really
was
going
somewhere
in
a
hurry
then
admitted
the
guest
in
which
case
i
ca
be
quite
so
offended
i
wonder
if
that
nurse
enjoys
her
trips
with
him
when
his
mouth
does
happen
to
be
shut
like
a
steel
if
she
could
have
seen
the
pair
on
the
train
which
presently
bore
them
flying
away
across
the
state
she
would
hardly
have
envied
either
of
them
between
abstraction
on
the
one
side
and
reserve
an
the
other
they
exchanged
less
conversation
than
two
strangers
might
have
done
when
miss
mathewson
eyes
drooped
with
weariness
her
companion
made
her
as
comfortable
as
he
could
and
bade
her
rest
his
own
eyes
were
untouched
by
slumber
he
stared
straight
before
him
or
out
into
the
night
seeing
nothing
but
a
white
farmhouse
far
ahead
where
his
anxious
thoughts
were
waiting
for
his
body
to
catch
up
are
they
much
sick
zeke
wal
i
dunno
hardly
you
goin
to
drive
they
pretty
lively

the
mornin

worryin
about

a
spell
and
now
that
she
took
down
so
severe
herself
he

to
pieces
some
miss
ellen
be
glad
to
see
the
blacks
covered
the
mile
from
the
station
as
they
had
never
covered
it
before
and
burns
was
in
the
house
five
minutes
before
they
had
expected
him
mother
here
your
big
dad
here
i
am
here
red
bless
your
hearts
you
wanted
me
did
you
they
could
hardly
tell
him
how
they
had
wanted
him
but
he
saw
it
in
their
faces
i
got
to
take
the
four
back

luck
for
some
operations
i
ca
postpone
but
between

and
then
i
going
to
look

set
you
straight
and
i

in
two
days
if
you
need
me
now
for
it
mother
first
come
here
aunt
ellen
and
tell
me
all
about
burns
had
never
been
quicker
nor
more
thorough
at
examination
of
a
pair
of
patients
than
with
these
he
went
straight
at
them
both
each
in
the
presence
of
the
other
miss
mathewson
capably
assisting
with
his
most
professional
air
he
asked
his
questions
applied
his
trained
senses
to
the
searching
tests
made
of
special
organs
and
gave
directions
for
future
treatment
then
he
sat
back
and
looked
at
them
do
i
appear
worried
about
her
dad
why
you
do
seem
to
miss
mathewson
should
you
gather
from
my
appearance
that
i
am
consumed
with
anxiety
i
think
you
seem
very
much
relieved
doctor
mother
as
you
look
at
dad
over
on
the
couch
there
does
he
strike
you
as
appearing
like
a
frightfully
sick
man
burns
smiled
faintly
in
the
direction
of
the
couch
but
her
eyes
came
immediately
back
to
her
son
he
seems
a
good
deal
better
since
you
came
there
not
a
thing
the
matter
with
either
of
you
except
what
can
be
fixed
up
in
a
week
you
got
scared
to
death
about
each
other
and
that
pulled
you
both
down
what
you
need
more
than
anything
else
is
to
go
to
a
circus
and
by
george
since
i
did
observe
any
tents
in
the
darkness
as
we
drove
along
you
shall
have
one
come
to
you
look
here
did
you
know
i
kept
up
my
old
athletic
stunts
these
nine
years
since
i
left
college
he
pulled
off
his
coat
waistcoat
collar
shoes
rolled
his
as
high
as
they
would
go
and
turned
a
series
of
handsprings
across
the
wide
room
then
he
stood
on
his
head
he
balanced
chairs
on
his
chin
he
seized
his
father
hickory
stick
and
went
through
a
set
of
military
evolutions
then
he
put
on
his
shoes
eyeing
his
patients
with
satisfaction
his
mother
had
lifted
her
head
to
watch
him
and
miss
mathewson
had
tucked
an
extra
pillow
under
it
his
father
had
drawn
himself
up
to
a
posture
and
was
regarding
his
son
with
pride
i
never
thought
so
well
of
those
doings
before
he
was
saying
if
they
kept
you
as
supple
as
a
willow
in
spite
of
your
weight
i
should
say
you
better
keep
you
bet
i
will
see
here
aunt
ellen

used
to
play
the
washerwoman

playing
it
now

mathewson
and
i
are
going
to
do
a
he
glanced
laughing
at
his
office
nurse
she
was
staring
at
him
he
threw
back
his
head
showing
a
splendid
array
of
white
teeth
as
he
roared
at
her
expression
forget
burns
please
said
he
in
answer
to
the
expression
he
discharged
this
case
as
not
serious
enough
for
him
and
left
it
to
red
pepper
to
administer
a
few
gentle
stimulants
on
the
quack
order
come
you
can
do
a
cake
walk
forget
you
a
graduate
of
any
training
school
but
the
vaudeville
show
he
caught
her
hand
flushing
so
that
her
plain
face
became
almost
pretty
she
yielded
for
the
hand
was
insistent
miss
ellen
leaned
bewildered
against
the
door
which
led
to
the
where
the
old
piano
stood
her
nephew
looked
at
her
again
with
the
eyes
which
the
chesters
guest
had
somewhat
incoherently
described
as
he
said
please
aunt
ellen
there
a
good
fellow
at
which
burns
senior
chuckled
under
his
breath
for
anything
less
like
that
of
a
good
fellow
was
never
seen
than
sister
ellen
prim
little
personality
miss
ellen
went
protestingly
to
the
piano
was
it
right
her
manner
said
to
be
performing
in
this
idiotic
manner
at
this
unholy
hour
of
three
in
the
morning
in
a
it
mattered
little
whether
miss
mathewson
could
or
could
not
dance
the
irish
washerwoman
or
any
other
antic
dance
improvised
to
that
live
air
she
had
only
to
yield
herself
to
red
pepper
burns
hands
and
steps
and
let
him
disport
himself
around
her
a
most
startlingly
hilarious
performance
was
immediately
and
effectively
produced
at
the
height
of
it
a
door
across
the
which
commanded
a
strip
of
the
bedroom
beyond
opened
cautiously
and
zeke
crandall
eye
glued
itself
to
the
aperture
an
eye
astonished
beyond
belief
if
that
there
red
ai
up
jest
exactly
as
he
used
to
when
he
was
a
boy
and
his
pa
and
ma
sick
if
was
anybody
but
red
say
he
was
then
he
caught
the
sound
of
a
laugh
from
lips
he
had
not
heard
laugh
like
that
for
a
year
a
chuckling
delighted
laugh
only
slightly
asthmatic
and
wholly
unrestrained
he
began
to
laugh
himself
if
folks
round
here
could
see
red
burns
now
they
never
believe
the
stories
about
his
gettin
to
be
such
a
darned
successful
man
at
his
business
he
reflected
of
all
the
goin
on
look
at
him
now
that
nurse
an
miss
ellen
for
oh
my
eye
songs
followed
college
songs
popular
airs
opera
bits
all
delivered
in
a
resounding
barytone
and
accompanied
by
thumping
chords
improvised
by
the
performer
out
through
the
open
windows
they
floated
and
one
astonished
villages
driving
by
to
take
the
early
train
caught
the
exultant
strains
oh

before
they
knew
it
the
early
morning
light
was
creeping
in
at
the
windows
burns
consulted
his
watch
if
you
give
us
a
cup
of
coffee
aunt
ellen
we
be
off
in
fifteen
minutes
miss
mathewson
his
glance
mirthfully
surveyed
her
aunt
ellen
will
take
you
upstairs
and
give
you
a
chance
to
put
that
magnificent
brown
hair
into
a
condition
where
it
will
not
shock
the
natives
at
the
station
as
for
mine
when
aunt
ellen
and
miss
mathewson
each
in
her
own
way
feeling
as
if
she
had
passed
through
an
extraordinary
experience
likely
never
to
occur
again
had
hurried
away
burns
applied
himself
to
a
process
of
reconstruction
when
every
rebellious
red
hair
had
been
reduced
to
its
usual
order
and
his
thick
locks
lay
with
the
little
wave
in
them
as
his
mother
had
begun
to
brush
them
years
ago
when
collar
and
cravat
rose
sedately
above
the
gray
tweed
coat
and
a
fresh
fine
handkerchief
had
replaced
the
dingy
one
which
had
been
through
every
manner
of
exercise
in
the
circus
burns
drew
up
a
chair
and
faced
his
patients
with
the
keen
professional
gaze
which
told
him
whether
or
not
his
night
work
had
been
good
therapeutics
when
i
gone
you
to
have
breakfast
and
i
think
you
both
eat
it
he
said
smiling
at
them
his
eyes
bright
with
affection
and
contentment
then
you
to
compose
yourselves
for
sleep
and
i
think
you
both
sleep
dad
to
be
out
on
the
porch
all
june
is
out
there
and
the
roses
are
in
full
bloom
day
after
mother
be
there
too
in
the
hammock
as
soon
as
these
cases
i
operate
on
this
morning
are
out
of
danger
i
be
down
again
for
a
whole
day
i
keep
the
time
i
afraid
said
his
father
looking
suddenly
anxious
for
a
new
cause
your
being
up
all
night
wo
make
your
hand
any
steadier
for
those
operations
on
the
contrary
as
a
matter
of
fact
dad
it
be
a
lot
steadier
just
because
of
my
being
up
all
night
assuring
myself
that
there
nothing
serious
the
matter
with
you
and
mother
except
the
need
of
a
bit
of
jollying
by
your
boy
which
you
certainly
had
right
off
the
reel
eh
aunt
ellen
thinks
yet
i
probably
killed
you
are
you
the
worse
for
it
mother
give
it
to
me
straight
now
he
bent
over
her
his
fingers
on
her
delicate
wrist
she
smiled
up
into
his
eyes
redfield
she
murmured
as
if
i
could
ever
be
the
worse
for
having
you
come
home
he
dropped
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
looking
at
her
with
the
eyes
of
the
boy
she
had
borne
bless
me
mother
he
said
unsteadily
all
the
fun
gone
out
of
his
face
i
need
it
to
keep
the
last
three
words
were
under
his
breath
but
she
heard
the
others
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
red
head
with
a
tremulous
soft
word
or
two
which
lie
could
barely
catch
in
a
minute
he
had
risen
his
cheek
flushed
high
and
was
gripping
his
father
hand
you
too
dad
he
begged
i
only
red
this
morning
going
back
into
the
his
father
hand
and
voice
shook
as
he
administered
the
little
ceremony
used
only
once
before
in
his
son
life
when
at
fourteen
he
first
went
away
to
school
few
grown
men
would
have
asked
for
it
again
he
felt
that
coming
from
red
he
was
sure
the
request
meant
more
than
they
could
know
then
the
professional
gentleman
whom
the
world
knew
the
world
which
was
not
acquainted
with
red
pepper
burns
and
the
professional
lady
who
was
his
assistant
went
decorously
away
into
the
early
june
morning
zeke
was
grinning
to
himself
as
he
saw
them
step
aboard
the
train
looks
mighty
fine
in
them
city
clothes
red
does
he
reflected
if
that
there
young
woman
chose
to
give
him
away
now
but
i
kind
of
guess
she

the
circumstances

laid
down
his
saw
with
which
in
the
late
june
twilight
he
had
been
doing
vigorous
work
at
a
small
woodpile
behind
the
house
he
stood
up
straight
throwing
back
his
shoulders
to
take
the
kink
out
of
them
all
right
said
he
i
think
i
fit

i
was
when
i
tackled
this

nothing

fifteen
minutes
of

for
this

of

not

of

in

and
brass
plainly
did
not

two
hours
later

trying

into
a
smooth
run
of
miles
at
not
anything
like
the
full
pace
of
which
the
motor
was
capable
best
not
to
overheat
her
at
first
run
your
first
three
hundred
miles
with
consideration
for
her
vital
organs
she
have
her
wind
by
that
next
morning
four
women
watched
the
brown
beauty
roll
invitingly
up
to
macauley
porch
steps
as
she
crossed
the
lawn
with
winifred
pauline
hempstead
the
guest
of
the
chesters
was
studying
not
only
the
car
but
the
undeniably
attractive
figure
of
the
younger
sister
of
macauley
will
red
look
at
her
any
more
than
he
does
at
me
she
murmured
in
winifred
chester
ear
i
doubt
it
my
dear
but
he
be
foolish
if
he
does
wo
he
i
do
care
for
widows
i
presume
winifred
laughed
comprehendingly
how
old
is
she
i
believe
though
she
does
look
does
look
it
she
looks
a
lot
winifred
laughed
still
quietly
although
pauline
undoubtedly
had
the
advantage
of
ellen
in
years
her
somewhat
sumptuous
beauty
was
not
of
so
youthful
a
type
as
the
darker
colouring
and
slenderer
outlines
of
martha
sister
the
man
at
the
wheel
of
the
brown
car
lifted
his
leather
cap
as
the
women
came
out
but
he
left
all
the
bestowal
of
them
to
the
other
men
miss
hempstead
asked
to
be
allowed
to
sit
beside
the
driver
but
macauley
vowed
that
on
the
first
long
run
of
his
new
machine
he
himself
should
occupy
that
post
of
honour
and
interest
coming
back
then
insisted
the
girl
and
macauley
agreed
reluctantly
burns
made
no
comment
but
applied
himself
to
his
task
not
only
then
but
also
for
every
minute
of
the
miles
to
their
destination
he
might
as
well
be
a
hired
chauffeur
complained
miss
hempstead
when
during
a
stop
of
ten
minutes
on
account
of
a
switching
freight
train
she
had
leaned
forward
and
attempted
in
vain
to
carry
on
a
conversation
with
burns
that
abstracted
mood
of
his
is
there
any
breaking
into
it
fall
out
and
break
your
he
be
all
attention
advised
chester
thank
you
i
almost
tempted
to
why
do
you
drive
awhile
macauley
and
give
him
a
rest
and
let
him
sit
here
in
the
middle
with
you
he
could
be
pried
loose
from
that
wheel
now
besides
i
have
driven
this
car
yet
and
too
different
in
her
steering
from
my
old
one
i
should
like
to
try
with
this
crowd
behind
they
reached
the
distant
city
drew
up
at
the
steps
of
the
most
attractive
hotel
went
in
to
lunch
that
is
to
say
all
did
this
except
burns
he
remained
in
the
garage
in
the
rear
where
he
had
taken
the
car
busying
himself
with
some
details
of
mechanism
whose
working
did
not
quite
suit
him
in
spite
of
summons
and
appeals
he
continued
to
work
until
the
rest
had
finished
then
he
bolted
in
to
wash
off
dust
and
engine
grease
ate
his
lunch
in
ten
minutes
macauley
sitting
by
and
expostulating
and
bolted
out
again
we
going
to
walk
about
a
bit
chester
announced
invading
the
garage
the
girls
insist
that
you
come
where
are
your
eyes
man
if
pauline
bores
you
i
admit
that
she
a
trifle
persistent
but
jolly
good
company
i
think
try
lessing
she
delightful
and
not
the
pursuing
style
at
all
she
learned
better
she
has
shown
the
slightest
interest
in
you
all
morning
that
ought
to
attract
i
going
to
try
a
bit
of
adjustment
on
this
timer
now
that
out
of
the
way
go
along
and
do
bother
burns
was
in
his
again
and
spoke
gruffly
his
cap
was
off
and
thick
locks
lay
damply
against
his
moist
brow
in
his
eyes
sparkled
enthusiasm
but
not
for
women
you
certainly
are
a
hopeless
case
and
chester
went
back
to
his
party
we
might
as
well
not
have
a
bachelor
along
mourned
pauline
four
women
with
only
two
old
married
men
to
look
after
them
it
a
but
we
both
of
us
much
handsomer
than
red
pepper
burns
asserted
james
macauley
junior
and
i
hardly
spoken
a
word
to
my
wife
since
i
started
that
sort
of
thing
ought
to
content
it
does
and
neither
of
you
is
half
as
as
doctor
burns
he
has
the
most
interesting
profile
i
ever
saw
and
i
ought
to
know
i
seldom
catch
sight
of
his
full
i
should
suppose
an
interesting
profile
whatever
that
is
would
offset
a
shock
of
hair
now
both
chester
hair
and
mine
his
hair
is
it
a
rather
strong
macauley
shouted
and
the
rest
laughed
with
him
rather
strong
i
should
say
it
was
i
been
worried
about
having
him
sit
near
the
gasoline
tank
it
brings
his
hair
so
close
to
a
high
combustible
but
it
has
one
advantage
if
we
do
get
home
before
dark
we
sha
need
to
light
up
red
torch
of
a
head
will
do
the
trick
we
can
come
in
by
the
refulgence
from
i
shall
be
sitting
in
its
light
going
back
anyhow
miss
hempstead
exulted
much
good
it
will
do
you
prophesied
chester
it
did
pauline
so
much
good
as
that
she
was
able
to
obtain
many
looks
at
the
profile
she
admired
for
she
saw
it
against
the
passing
landscape
for
the
sixty
miles
of
daylight
out
of
the
miles
home
while
she
sat
beside
its
owner
and
tried
many
times
to
draw
him
into
talk
his
taciturnity
on
this
particular
day
was
a
thing
beyond
any
experience
with
it
she
had
yet
had
she
had
heard
burns
talk
and
talk
well
on
many
different
subjects
the
while
he
sat
upon
the
porch
of
a
summer
evening
the
three
of
them
about
him
and
he
had
seemed
to
enjoy
talking
he
certainly
could
not
be
wholly
occupied
with
the
machine
for
at
no
time
did
he
let
the
engine
out
for
what
it
could
do
but
contented
himself
with
a
steady
moderate
pace
very
different
from
the
sort
of
furious
speed
in
which
he
and
the
green
imp
were
accustomed
to
indulge
when
occasion
offered
altogether
he
presented
to
the
girl
a
problem
which
she
could
not
solve
and
was
never
further
from
solving
than
during
the
miles
she
sat
beside
him
on
the
run
home
you
all
to
come
in
and
have
an
supper
with
us
macauley
declared
as
the
car
turned
in
at
the
home
driveway
hot
coffee
too
if
you
want
it
or
even
beefsteak
if
you
prefer
but
i
thought
since
it
was
so
hot
i
take
the
beefsteak
announced
burns
over
his
shoulder
if
i
find
nothing
urgent
for
me
to
do
if
there
a
call
if
there
is
make
it
and
you
shall
have
the
beefsteak
when
you
get
back
martha
promised
him
macauley
was
of
the
sort
of
young
married
woman
who
delights
to
make
her
friends
comfortable
and
none
better
than
red
pepper
who
was
her
husband
most
valued
friend
as
he
was
that
of
his
neighbour
on
the
other
side
arthur
chester
to
everybody
regret
the
call
was
waiting
and
as
the
party
went
in
to
supper
they
waved
their
hands
at
the
green
imp
flying
away
down
the
road
it
was
not
till
long
after
the
supper
was
ended
and
the
women
freshly
clad
were
sitting
on
the
porch
again
the
men
smoking
on
the
steps
below
them
that
tine
green
imp
came
back
ten
minutes
later
a
large
figure
crossed
the
lawn
at
a
pace
which
suggested
both
reluctance
and
fatigue
if
it
had
been
for
that
beefsteak
burns
began
you
would
have
come
finished
macauley
oh
we
know
that
go
in
and
get
it
red
and
perhaps
afterward
the
charms
of
human
society
will
have
their
whether
or
not
the
beefsteak
made
the
difference
a
change
had
taken
place
when
burns
at
length
returned
to
the
comforts
of
the
porch
he
threw
himself
upon
a
crimson
cushion
on
the
upper
step
precisely
at
the
feet
as
it
chanced
of
ellen
lessing
as
he
leaned
comfortably
back
against
the
porch
pillar
he
looked
directly
up
into
her
face
his
eyes
meeting
hers
with
an
odd
searching
expression
as
if
he
now
saw
her
for
the
first
time
pauline
gazing
enviously
across
saw
the
black
eyes
meet
the
hazel
ones
in
the
dim
light
and
noted
that
a
curiously
long
look
was
exchanged
the
sort
of
look
which
denotes
that
two
people
are
observing
each
other
closely
without
attempt
at
producing
an
impression
only
at
discovering
what
is
there
but
when
burns
began
to
talk
he
appeared
to
address
the
midsummer
night
air
staring
off
into
it
and
speaking
rather
low
so
that
they
all
leaned
forward
to
listen
for
at
last
he
seemed
to
have
something
other
than
motor
cars
upon
his
mind
he
a
mighty
taking
little
chap
he
said
musingly
curly
black
hair
eyes
like
coals
with
a
fringe
around
like
a
hedge
cheeks
none
too
round
but
milk
and
eggs
and
good
red
steaks
will
take
care
of
that
a
body
like
a
cherubs
when
it
filled
out
a
what
in
the
name
of
gibberish
are
you
giving
as
red
inquired
macauley
name
bob
went
on
red
pepper
by
all
the
odd
chances
that
what
decided
me
burns
it
was
the
last
straw
is
he
crazy
asked
chester
of
the
company
they
seemed
undecided
they
were
listening
closely
clothes
one
pair
of
patched
breeches
remember
breeches
ches
one
faded
flannel
shirt
mended
till
there
was
much
left
to
mend
a
straw
hat
with
a
fringe
around
it
uneven
fringe
inside
a
heartache
as
big
as
a
little
fellow
could
carry
and
stagger
under
it
think
of
having
the
heartache
at
five
and
for
your
grandmother
why
for
his
grandmother
asked
winifred
chester
because
there
was
anybody
else
to
have
it
for
rest
all
gone
grandmother
the
one
who
attended
the
breeches
and
patched
the
shirt
and
went
without
food
herself
lest
the
boy
cheeks
get
thinner
yet
that
was
what
fixed
her
at
last
she
had
enough
vitality
to
pull
her
so
that
was
the
matter
with
you
hazarded
chester
worried
about
your
patient
all
day
and
found
you
lost
her
when
you
got
back
burns
turned
upon
him
with
a
characteristic
flash
you
go
join
the
ranks
of
the
they
sometimes
miss
fire
no
i
did
lost
her
before
i
went
or
i
would
have
gone
not
for
you
or
any
other
it
was
the
kiddie
that
was
on
my
mind
as
i
seen
him
where
is
he
now
asked
martha
macauley
urgently
she
was
the
mother
of
two
small
sons
and
burns
sketch
had
interested
her
he
looked
up
at
her
want
to
see
him
of
course
i
do
did
you
take
him
to
somebody
in
town
are
you
going
to
send
him
to
the
asylum
in
the
city
do
you
want
to
see
him
burns
inquired
of
winifred
chester
he
rose
red
what
do
you
mean
have
you
got
a
child
here
come
along
all
of
you
if
you
like
he
wo
wake
up
he
sleeping
like
a
top
ca
help
it
with
all
that
bread
and
milk
inside
of
him
part
cream
it
was
too
i
saw
cynthia
chucking
it
in
he
got
her
good
and
plenty
in
the
first
five
minutes
bless
her
susceptible
heart
come
talk
of
susceptible
hearts
jeered
macauley
as
he
followed
the
softest
one
in
the
nobody
would
ever
guess
it
murmured
pauline
hempstead
they
tiptoed
into
the
house
across
the
offices
into
the
big
square
room
which
was
burns
own
he
switched
on
a
hooded
beside
the
bed
and
turned
it
so
that
its
rays
fell
on
the
small
occupant
he
lay
in
fashion
arms
and
legs
thrown
wide
the
black
curly
head
disdaining
the
pillow
one
fist
clutching
a
man
in
sleep
the
little
face
was
an
exquisite
one
the
onlookers
might
guess
what
it
would
be
awake
burns
pointed
at
the
crop
smiling
that
was
the
nearest
approach
to
a
plaything
i
could
muster
the
shops
will
help
me
i
send
over
plenty
in
the
morning
red
whispered
martha
macauley
her
eyes
were
suspiciously
shiny
did
you
bring
him
home
just
now
questioned
winifred
burns
nodded
i
had
meant
to
get
him
if
i
did
at
all
my
call
took
me
within
half
a
mile
i
went
over
and
saw
him
again
that
settled
the
small
sleeper
stirred
sighed
burns
turned
off
the
light
in
a
twinkling
he
not
used
to
electricity
point
blank
he
chuckled
going
down
the
steps
a
hand
touched
his
arm
he
looked
into
ellen
lessing
upturned
face
and
discovered
anew
that
it
was
a
face
to
hold
the
attention
of
a
man
but
there
was
no
coquetry
in
it
instead
he
saw
a
stirred
look
in
eyes
which
struck
him
suddenly
as
singularly
like
those
of
the
child
he
had
just
shown
her
black
with
a
fringe
around
doctor
burns
she
said
will
you
give
me
the
very
great
pleasure
of
dressing
the
boy
i
know
how
to
do
of
course
if
you
want
to
he
responded
gladly
i
hoped
you
ladies
would
look
after
let
me
do
it
alone
she
urged
they
have
their
children
it
would
only
be
a
task
to
them
to
me
i
ca
tell
you
what
a
delight
it
would
i
take
you
and
bob
to
the
city
in
the
morning
if
you
it
will
be
a
happy
morning
for
bob
and
me
then
she
answered
and
he
saw
it
in
her
face
that
it
would
be
but
he
felt
that
it
was
because
of
the
boy
not
for
any
other
reason
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
possibly
be
a
happy
morning
for
the
driver
of
the
green
imp
also
so
ellen
going
to
dress
the
macauley
was
strolling
over
the
lawn
with
chester
and
burns
as
having
the
women
on
the
macauley
porch
the
men
were
turning
bedward
reluctant
to
leave
the
cool
of
the
july
night
it
easy
to
see
why
she
wants
to
do
that
her
boy
would
have
been
just
about
this
bob
age
by
now
tough
luck
was
it
when
he
was
all
she
had
left
since
jack
got
out
of
the
game
burns
stared
at
him
oh
that
why
i
did
know
about
her
boy
or
i
forgotten
it
if
i
was
ever
told
she
will
enjoy
fitting
bob
out
if
i
can
keep
her
from
putting
him
into
white
clothes
to
make
him
resemble
an
angel
instead
of
a
small
boy
with
an
eye
for
you
find
ellen
no
fool
macauley
assured
him
warmly
but
if
she
takes
an
interest
in
the
boy
it
be
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
him
she
has
a
lot
of
money
she
may
get
a
notion
to
adopt
but
upon
this
red
pepper
burns
spoke
with
decision
confound
you
the
kiddie
belongs
to
me
did
i
tell
you
his
name
is
now
robert
burns
she
may
dress
him
if
she
likes
she
ca
have
him
not
by
a
long
shot
he
mine
oh
well
it
might
be
arranged
murmured
macauley
but
not
quite
low
enough
in
a
flash
he
was
laid
flat
on
his
back
on
the
lawn
a
menacing
figure
standing
over
him
none
of
that
growled
the
man
with
the
temper
not
now
or
any
other
then
he
laughed
and
let
his
victim
up
alcohol
will
take
out
grass
stains
jim
he
advised
tell
martha
chapter
iv
in
which
he
makes
a
concession
red
pepper
burns
opened
his
eyes
what
on
earth
was
that
a
small
voice
piping
at
him
from
within
close
range
but
how
could
that
be
something
bumped
against
him
he
turned
his
head
on
his
pillow
a
small
figure
at
his
side
had
raised
itself
upon
its
elbow
big
black
eyes
in
a
pale
little
face
were
staring
at
him
in
affright
burns
roused
himself
suddenly
very
wide
awake
indeed
it
all
right
little
man
said
he
pulling
the
child
gently
into
the
warmth
of
his
encircling
arm
you
came
home
with
me
last
night
you
remember
you
going
to
make
me
a
visit
and
this
morning
after
breakfast
we
going
to
drive
to
town
and
buy
a
train
of
cars
red
shiny
cars
and
an
engine
with
a
bell
on
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
it
did
not
take
long
to
change
bob
fright
into
the
happiest
anticipations
red
pepper
burns
was
at
his
best
with
children
he
had
what
their
mothers
called
a
way
with
a
knock
at
the
door
and
cynthia
voice
calling
here
some
things
for
the
little
boy
doctor
put
an
end
to
a
full
of
delightful
comradeship
during
which
the
sheets
of
the
bed
had
became
a
tent
and
the
two
were
soldiers
resting
after
a
day
march
burns
rose
and
took
in
the
parcel
martha
macauley
had
sent
it
her
boy
harold
was
the
nearest
in
size
to
bob
of
any
of
the
children
of
his
neighbours
and
the
parcel
held
everything
needed
from
undershirt
to
scarlet
windsor
scarf
to
tie
under
the
rolling
collar
of
the
blue
blouse
a
bath
first
bob
and
his
new
guardian
initiated
him
into
the
exciting
experience
of
a
splash
in
a
big
white
tub
in
water
decidedly
warmer
than
it
would
be
a
week
hence
when
he
should
have
become
used
to
the
invigorating
cool
plunge
then
burns
glowing
from
contact
with
water
as
cold
as
it
could
be
got
from
the
tap
clad
in
bathrobe
and
slippers
attempted
to
solve
the
mysteries
of
bob
toilet
roars
of
laughter
interspersed
with
high
pipings
of
glee
presently
brought
cynthia
to
the
door
ca
i
help
you
doctor
burns
she
called
anxiously
not
a
bit
of
it
cynthia
much
obliged
i
having
the
time
of
my
life
stand
still
son
let
try
it
this
way
round
came
back
to
the
housekeeper
ears
i
ai
never
wore
so
many
things
before
bob
declared
doubtfully
as
a
small
white
waist
with
dangling
elastic
was
finally
discovered
to
go
best
buttoned
in
the
back
i
know
but
you
see
how
fine
it
is
to
have
your
stockings
held
up
for
you
hi
here
are
some
sandals
bob
barefoot
sandals
only
wear
them
over
stockings
since
we
going
shopping
now
for
these
blue
garments
i
wonder
how
they
go
things
they
look
to
me
i
suppose
they
resolve
into
baggy
knickers
and
the
sort
of
long
shirt
with
a
belt
to
it
the
youngsters
of
your
age
all
wear
here
we
go
does
this
top
part
button
behind
bob
like
the
waist
no
i
think
not
it
sure
looks
odd
whichever
way
we
don
it
but
that
may
be
because
it
pretty
big
harold
several
sizes
bigger
than
you
though
he
ca
be
much
older
give
me
six
months
and
i
have
you
filling
out
any
other
my
hands
they
all
gone
remarked
the
child
holding
out
his
arms
the
blue
sleeves
did
indeed
cover
them
to
the
laughing
burns
rolled
the
cloth
back
making
an
awkward
bunch
at
the
wrist
but
allowing
the
small
hands
freedom
when
lessing
trains
her
eye
on
you
she
want
to
make
time
getting
to
the
shops
burns
observed
struggling
with
the
scarlet
scarf
and
finally
tying
it
like
a
but
you
clean
bob
and
hungry
i
hope
now
i
want
a
great
big
hug
to
pay
me
for
dressing
he
held
out
his
arms
and
his
new
charge
sprang
into
them
pressing
arms
like
sticks
around
the
strong
neck
of
the
man
who
seemed
to
him
already
the
best
friend
he
had
in
the
world
as
he
was
at
eleven
a
round
of
calls
made
the
green
imp
came
for
bob
and
lessing
they
met
him
hand
in
hand
the
little
figure
in
its
voluminous
misfit
clothes
looking
quaint
enough
beside
the
perfect
outlines
of
his
companion
attire
but
both
faces
were
very
happy
how
many
dollars
do
you
suppose
ellen
has
stowed
away
in
that
handsome
purse
of
hers
ready
to
spend
on
the
child
martha
macauley
queried
of
winifred
chester
as
they
watched
the
green
imp
out
of
sight
from
the
macauley
porch
chester
shook
her
head
i
no
idea
she
want
to
get
him
everything
a
child
could
have
but
red
wo
let
he
wo
know
he
drop
them
at
a
store
and
go
off
to
the
hospital
the
things
will
come
home
by
special
delivery
and
the
next
thing
he
sees
will
be
bob
in
silk
socks
and
white
i
do
believe
it
he
go
shopping
with
them
he
wild
over
the
boy
and
he
does
care
a
straw
what
people
might
think
who
saw
the
three
together
he
tyrannize
over
ellen
and
she
let
him
for
the
pleasure
of
being
ruled
by
a
man
once
more
it
was
a
shrewd
prophecy
and
goes
to
show
that
women
really
understand
each
other
pretty
well
women
of
the
same
sort
for
red
pepper
burns
did
go
shopping
with
the
pair
from
start
to
finish
it
was
an
experience
he
did
not
see
any
occasion
for
missing
you
wo
mind
my
coming
too
was
all
the
permission
he
asked
and
lessing
answered
simply
surely
not
if
you
care
to
we
shall
want
your
she
had
not
conducted
them
to
a
department
store
but
to
the
small
shop
of
a
decidedly
exclusive
children
outfitter
burns
knew
nothing
about
the
presumably
greater
cost
of
buying
a
wardrobe
in
a
place
like
this
but
he
soon
scented
danger
he
scrutinized
certain
glass
showcases
containing
wax
lay
figures
of
youngsters
attired
as
for
the
stage
and
boomed
his
first
caution
into
his
companion
ear
that
not
the
sort
of
puppet
we
want
to
make
out
of
bob
eh
he
suggested
she
turned
smiling
not
unless
you
intend
to
keep
him
in
a
glass
case
doctor
no
imitation
of
a
either
please
said
he
pointing
disfavour
in
his
eye
at
the
presentment
of
a
infant
of
five
in
a
outfit
of
white
flannel
topped
by
an
expensive
straw
hat
i
see
you
not
going
to
trust
me
murmured
lessing
as
a
saleswoman
approached
i
trust
you
but
i
intend
to
keep
my
eye
on
you
admitted
burns
frankly
he
observed
with
interest
the
wonderful
figure
of
the
saleswoman
quite
possibly
that
lady
thought
he
was
admiring
her
for
nothing
in
his
face
could
have
told
her
that
he
was
mapping
out
in
his
surgeon
mind
her
physical
anatomy
and
speculating
as
to
where
in
the
name
of
hygeia
she
could
have
disposed
of
her
digestive
organs
in
a
circumference
the
diminutive
size
of
that
underwear
first
lessing
went
straight
at
the
foundations
of
make
up
and
began
to
look
over
boxes
of
little
gossamer
shirts
and
tiny
union
suits
of
a
fabric
so
delicately
fine
that
burns
handled
a
fold
of
it
suspiciously
silk
he
questioned
she
shook
her
head
the
corners
of
her
mouth
curving
only
a
thread
now
and
then
mostly
lisle
for
very
hot
weather
these
others
have
some
wool
in
them
for
cooler
days
those
nearest
you
are
quite
warm
though
very
light
in
weight
for
really
cold
weather
you
not
planning
to
watch
the
thermometer
and
keep
him
changing
underwear
accordingly
not
at
all
doctor
burns
but
four
weights
for
the
year
are
too
many
are
they
are
you
buying
for
a
year
ahead
please
let
me
i
shall
not
be
here
when
he
needs
to
their
eyes
met
something
in
hers
made
him
desist
from
argument
stockings
came
next
lessing
bought
substantial
tan
ones
in
quantity
long
and
well
reenforced
then
she
took
up
socks
of
russet
and
of
white
shall
you
object
to
his
wearing
these
a
good
deal
she
asked
burns
he
took
up
one
small
sample
running
his
fingers
into
it
i
should
think
he
might
put
his
toes
through
one
of
those
in
an
hour
or
two
he
suggested
his
legs
are
pretty
thin
do
you
think
legs
in
short
socks
to
say
nothing
of
bruises
and
scratches
really
attractive
you
want
him
to
go
barefooted
a
good
deal
of
the
time
do
you
sure
but
legs
in
socks
are
neither
fish
flesh
nor
good
red
herring
to
my
in
spite
of
the
smile
on
his
lips
he
looked
obstinate
and
she
deliberated
drawing
a
white
sock
unmistakably
fine
and
expensive
over
her
hand
plainly
she
wanted
to
see
bob
in
socks
and
strap
slippers
of
the
sort
her
boy
would
have
worn
as
she
studied
the
sock
burns
studied
her
profile
get
him
a
pair
for
your
own
satisfaction
he
conceded
he
did
not
hear
the
order
she
gave
but
the
saleswoman
was
pleasantly
smiling
as
she
checked
it
the
next
thing
that
happened
bob
was
being
measured
then
he
was
trying
on
russian
blouse
suits
that
fitted
practical
little
garments
of
blue
galatea
of
linen
crash
even
of
brown
holland
burns
looked
on
approvingly
the
clothes
turned
bob
into
a
gentleman
son
no
doubt
of
that
but
it
was
the
sort
of
gentleman
son
who
can
have
the
very
best
of
romping
good
times
something
diverted
bums
attention
for
a
little
and
when
he
turned
back
to
bob
a
bright
scarlet
reefer
had
been
pulled
on
over
his
blouse
and
a
wide
sailor
hat
with
a
scarlet
ribbon
crowned
his
black
curls
the
result
was
engagingly
picturesque
but
the
critic
frowned
i
afraid
that
wo
do
lessing
he
objected
decidedly
you
do
like
the
colour
not
with
his
hair
and
eyes
it
wo
hurt
his
hair
but
it
will
his
eyes
the
sun
on
that
red
will
torture
will
it
i
should
have
thought
of
it
so
many
children
wear
and
shortly
come
to
spectacles
try
it
yourself
for
half
an
she
drew
off
the
reefer
bob
objected
i
like
the
red
jacky
dotter
burns
he
said
it
was
his
first
comment
hitherto
he
had
been
in
a
dazed
state
submitting
wonderingly
to
this
strange
experience
another
small
coat
of
cloth
with
a
gorgeous
emblem
on
the
sleeve
consoled
him
i
think
we
are
through
said
lessing
burns
looked
at
her
no
white
clothes
he
asked
did
you
want
him
to
have
some
no
but
i
thought
you
i
have
ordered
three
suits
to
be
made
for
him
she
admitted
flushing
a
little
they
will
be
very
plain
and
will
launder
beautifully
he
will
wear
them
only
on
special
occasions
do
you
mind
well
not
on
those
conditions
he
agreed
reluctantly
they
went
to
a
shoe
shop
and
bob
became
the
richer
for
leather
sandals
canvas
shoes
and
various
other
footwear
some
of
it
undeniably
fine
burns
took
one
little
black
slipper
into
his
hand
i
wonder
what
bob
grandmother
would
say
to
that
he
observed
in
a
whisper
ellen
lessing
regarded
its
mate
her
lashes
hid
her
eyes
but
her
lip
quivered
and
he
saw
it
the
salesman
was
busy
with
bob
burns
laid
his
hand
for
an
instant
on
hers
she
looked
up
and
a
smile
struggled
with
the
tears
a
toy
shop
came
last
here
bob
was
in
an
ecstasy
his
companions
walked
up
and
down
the
aisles
following
his
eager
steps
lessing
would
have
filled
his
arms
but
she
found
the
way
obstructed
he
may
have
the
train
of
cars
burns
consented
but
they
must
be
cars
he
have
to
pull
about
for
himself
no
not
the
trotting
horse
nor
the
trolley
on
the
track
nor
any
other
of
the
mechanical
stuff
get
him
that
dandy
little
and
that
box
of
building
blocks
but
that
the
mechanical
toys
are
of
the
best
sir
suggested
the
salesman
they
wo
break
except
with
pretty
rough
that
bad
burns
asserted
the
quicker
they
broke
the
less
objection
i
have
to
it
a
wonder
the
modern
child
has
a
trace
of
resource
or
inventiveness
left
in
him
teach
him
to
construct
not
to
destroy
then
you
done
something
for
is
he
rather
young
for
tools
lessing
was
turning
over
a
small
saw
in
her
hands
feeling
its
sharp
teeth
with
a
premonitory
finger
there
are
gauze
and
bandages
in
the
he
laughed
at
her
expression
as
she
laid
down
the
saw
you
wo
object
to
that
box
of
tin
soldiers
she
asked
decidedly
you
do
want
to
spoil
him
at
the
start
for
a
boy
who
never
had
a
toy
in
his
life
he
acquired
enough
now
to
turn
his
head
come
away
lessing
flee
temptation
come
bobby
and
burns
led
the
way
bob
astride
of
a
marvellous
taller
than
himself
was
like
to
weep
lessing
went
to
him
he
whispered
something
in
her
ear
she
came
back
to
burns
doctor
burns
said
she
every
boy
has
a
he
just
the
age
to
enjoy
it
surely
it
wo
hazard
his
inventiveness
it
will
develop
it
he
ride
all
over
the
country
as
you
do
in
the
green
what
the
price
it
not
costly
and
it
a
very
good
burns
inquired
the
price
again
this
time
he
asked
the
salesman
then
he
spoke
low
fifteen
dollars
seems
costly
to
you
i
suppose
think
of
bob
yesterday
with
not
a
toy
to
his
that
why
i
want
to
give
him
one
he
be
just
as
happy
riding
a
stick
as
soon
as
he
forgets
he
wo
forget
it
look
at
his
you
looking
at
his
eyes
all
the
time
that
what
undoes
he
had
to
look
away
from
her
eyes
then
himself
or
he
felt
quite
suddenly
that
he
too
would
have
been
undone
he
had
resisted
the
entreaty
in
women
eyes
many
times
but
not
always
despite
the
reputation
he
held
for
indifference
doctor
burns
wo
you
give
me
this
one
pleasure
you
really
been
quite
firm
all
the
she
was
smiling
but
he
had
himself
in
hand
again
and
he
was
blunt
with
her
bob
bachelor
child
now
he
said
he
must
be
trained
according
to
bachelors
ideas
come
you
know
it
out
of
reason
to
give
the
youngster
any
more
be
they
followed
him
out
of
the
store
bob
hand
held
fast
in
hers
somehow
they
both
looked
very
young
as
they
stood
outside
the
shop
window
gazing
back
at
the
marvellous
display
within
he
felt
as
if
he
were
being
rather
cruel
to
them
both
this
was
absurd
of
course
when
one
considered
the
box
of
blocks
the
train
of
cars
and
the
toolkit
the
child
had
enough
playthings
already
to
send
him
out
of
his
head
burns
drove
away
rapidly
to
get
out
of
range
of
other
windows
which
seemed
filled
with
he
looked
down
at
bob
happy
little
chap
he
asked
bob
nodded
his
arms
clasped
the
red
train
but
he
was
not
looking
at
it
like
the
cars
bob
nodded
his
wide
sailor
hat
obscured
his
face
burns
could
see
only
the
tip
of
the
small
nose
you
have
a
splendid
time
with
those
blocks
wo
you
again
the
nod
but
no
reply
the
hammer
pretty
nice
too
is
it
once
more
the
dumb
answer
but
the
silence
seemed
odd
for
bob
had
long
since
lost
his
fear
these
companions
look
up
here
reluctantly
the
child
obeyed
burns
caught
one
fleeting
glimpse
of
wet
black
lashes
one
big
tear
was
slowly
stealing
down
the
pale
little
cheek
what
the
matter
old
man
no
reply
burns
looked
at
ellen
lessing
behind
bob
back
she
did
not
meet
his
glance
she
was
looking
at
the
boy
it
struck
him
that
her
profile
made
the
most
enchanting
outline
he
had
ever
seen
he
tried
to
steel
his
heart
against
them
both
he
knew
his
theory
was
right
he
now
had
the
chance
to
put
it
into
practice
the
green
imp
turned
a
corner
to
the
right
they
were
not
yet
out
of
the
city
and
at
the
next
block
the
car
turned
another
corner
also
to
the
right
at
the
end
of
another
block
the
imp
swerved
once
more
to
the
right
this
brought
them
back
to
the
wide
street
which
led
to
the
shopping
district
they
had
lately
left
with
silent
passengers
the
imp
threaded
its
way
to
the
toy
shop
in
front
of
it
burns
stopped
the
car
he
got
out
and
went
in
and
came
out
the
big
in
the
arms
of
the
salesman
who
followed
him
he
looked
up
at
their
faces
bob
was
one
countenance
of
incredulous
joy
the
other
if
he
had
seen
there
satisfaction
at
having
brought
a
man
to
terms
he
felt

that

without

they
drove
off

bending
over
and
gently
stroking
the
splendid
black
mane
with
little
chuckles
and
gurgles
of
joy
once
more
burns
looked
at
ellen
lessing
behind
bob
back
you
happy
now
are
you
he
asked
in
tone
of
assurance
then
confound
it
i
must
own
i
paid
for
letting
my
wise
bachelor
notions
go
hang
just
for
this
time
thank
you
she
answered
very
gently
and
i
paid
for
trying
to

laughed
suddenly
content
between
them
the
little
lad
who
had
never
owned
a
toy
in
his
life
stowing
the
red
train
carefully
away
between

feet
gave
himself
wholly
to
the
well

was

macauley
greeting
to
her
sister
did
you
have
as
interesting
a
time
dressing
the
child
as
you
expected
i
had
a
charming
time
replied
lessing
she
shook
the
dust
out
of
her
long
gray
veils
smiling
at
her
memory
of
the
morning

prove
docile
does
seem
to
me
just
the
i
used
it
in
an
attempt
at
fine
irony
explained
macauley
well
was
he
tractable
then
he
was
very
polite
and
kind
and
jolly
until
the
real
business
of
shopping
began
then
he
became
suspicious
and
a
trifle
she
recalled
his
look
as
he
told
her
that
he
would
trust
her
but
that
he
meant
to
keep
an
eye
upon
her
did
you
get
your
own
way
about
anything
demanded
her
sister
with
eager
curiosity
ellen
looked
at
her
martha
noted
that
the
soft
black
eyes
were
glowing
and
that
she
had
not
seen
ellen
appear
more
alive
and
interested
since
the
days
before
trouble
came
to
her
do
you
imagine
we
fought
a
battle
over
our
shopping
she
asked
her
lips
curving
with
merriment
but
you
do
tell
me
i
anxious
to
know
whether
we
shall
see
the
boy
dressed
according
to
red
ideas
or
we
agreed
beautifully
on
nearly
all
points
of
his
dressing
where
we
differed
we
red
never
compromises
with
anybody
so
i
suppose
it
was
done
by
your
giving
in
he
never
compromises
you
do
him
injustice
he
can
compromise
royally
by
the
same
method
of
in
i
simply
ca
believe

shaking
her
head

are

redfield
pepper
burns
wheeled
around
in
his
revolving
chair
and
glanced
sharply
at
arthur
chester
what
he
saw
made
him
follow
the
inspection
with
a
direct
question
sit
down
what
have
you
been
doing
chester
sat
down
his
face
was
white
he
held
up
one
shaking
hand
red
what
the
matter
with
me
burns
continued
to
study
the
man
before
him
he
made
no
move
to
examine
into
his
condition
just
looked
steadily
into
the
other
face
with
a
gaze
before
which
his
patient
presently
shifted
uneasily
well
of
all
the
ways
to
treat
a
fellow
he
tried
to
laugh
is
that
the
way
you
do
with
the
rest
of
the
bunch
that
come
to
you
every
day
or
are
you
trying
to
hypnotize
me
look
me
in
the
eye
ches
what
have
you
been
doing
working
like
a
fiend
in
that
infernal
office
if
there
any
hotter
place
there
be
a
hotter
one
for
you
right
on
this
earth
if
you
keep
on
the
way
you
he
rose
suddenly
and
approaching
chester
closely
looked
intently
into
the
uplifted
eyes
he
sat
down
again
own
up
he
commanded
bluntly
red
begged
chester
quit
this
sort
of
thing
go
at
me
in
the
usual
way
i
i
think
i
a
bit
nervous
tonight
i
ca
stand
your
all
right
when
did
you
begin
five
weeks
ago
when
you
were
away
i
did
mean
to
get
into
it
red
on
my
word
i
did
after
all
you
warned
me
but
it
was
so
beastly
hot
and
there
was
a
lot
of
extra
work
at
the
office
my
head
got
to
going
it
night
and
day
i
say
he
leaned
suddenly
forward
has
head
on
his
hands
i
can
tell
you
better
if
you
give
me
some
kind
of
a
bracer
i
feel
so
burns
got
up
and
prepared
something
in
a
glass
something
not
particularly
palatable
but
when
it
had
taken
action
which
it
promptly
did
chester
white
face
had
acquired
a
tinge
of
colour
and
he
could
go
on
i
stopped
in
gardner
office
one
day
when
my
head
was
worse
than
usual
had
to
meet
a
man
in
ten
minutes
important
deal
on
for
the
house
had
to
be
at
my
best
told
gardner
so
he
fixed
he
did
blame
him
fixed
you
for
a
i
told
you
a
hundred
times
you
had
precisely
the
kind
of
temperament
that
must
avoid
that
sort
of
thing
like
the
burns
hit
the
desk
with
his
fist
as
he
spoke
with
a
thump
of
impatience
it
seems
to
set
me
up
for
a
while
i
can
do
anything
then
afterward
you
getting
the
afterward
all
right
how
much
do
you
take
chester
mentioned
the
amount
of
the
drug
stating
reluctantly
that
for
the
last
two
days
he
had
been
obliged
slightly
to
increase
it
in
order
to
get
the
full
effect
of
course
you
have
that
the
insidiousness
of
the
devil
stuff
how
soon
does
it
get
into
action
oh
right
away
almost
what
is
your
imagination
strong
enough
to
see
here
ches
burns
leaned
forward
you
taking
the
stuff
by
mouth
of
course
chester
eyes
went
down
why
i
tried
it
that
way
but
it
was
so
burns
ejaculated
something
under
his
breath
the
quick
colour
always
ready
to
flare
under
his
clear
skin
leaped
out
gardner
gave
you
a
hypo
i
suppose
so
you
went
and
bought
a
syringe
and
taught
yourself
the
trick
suppose
you
give
me
a
look
at
like
a
shamed
schoolboy
chester
unwillingly
drew
forth
the
small
case
from
his
pocket
burns
received
it
he
opened
it
and
took
out
the
tiny
instrument
it
looks
like
a
very
good
one
he
observed
with
a
sort
of
deadly
quietness
and
with
one
motion
of
his
big
fingers
snapped
the
glass
barrel
in
two
at
this
chester
took
fire
that
going
a
little
too
far
he
burst
out
in
wrath
is
it
thought
it
was
you
who
had
gone
too
far
it
up
to
me
to
bring
you
back
while
i
can
getting
this
little
fiend
out
of
the
way
is
the
first
step
keep
cool
ches
and
i
try
to
do
the
same
though
it
makes
my
blood
boil
to
think
how
little
you
cared
for
my
lectures
to
you
on
this
very
i
have
cared
but
i
had
no
well
you
have
one
now
it
taken
you
five
weeks
to
acquire
enough
of
a
habit
to
give
you
some
trouble
to
drop
it
you
that
sort
and
that
the
way
it
works
anyhow
i
wonder
you
came
to
me
found
yourself
out
of
the
stuff
and
did
like
to
try
to
get
it
here
where
folks
know
you
if
you
want
to
put
everything
in
the
most
disagreeable
way
you
can
yes
admitted
chester
testily
that
precisely
what
i
want
to
do
put
it
in
such
a
disagreeable
way
that
your
backbone
stiffen
up
a
bit
and
give
us
something
to
start
with
if
i
make
you
mad
all
the
better
so
long
as
you
do
go
back
to
fools
like
gardner
who
never
hesitate
to
give
a
fellow
like
you
a
sample
of
what
that
drug
do
for
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
sha
sleep
and
i
got
to
be
in
the
office
when
your
vacation
due
not
till
week
after
arrange
to
take
it
i
ca
stillinger
off
on
his
monday
could
you
have
yours
now
if
he
waited
yes
but
i
would
ask
i
burns
took
down
the
receiver
of
his
desk
telephone
red
stop
i
do
want
burns
paid
no
attention
to
him
in
five
minutes
he
had
the
city
connection
and
his
man
he
stated
the
case
chester
was
in
urgent
need
of
taking
his
vacation
without
delay
but
was
not
willing
to
ask
the
favour
of
his
office
associate
he
burns
his
friend
physician
did
not
scruple
to
ask
it
if
it
would
not
interfere
too
seriously
with
stillinger
plans
no
diplomat
could
re
quest
a
favour
more
courteously
than
burns
the
reply
was
the
one
to
be
expected
of
stillinger
bachelor
and
amiable
fellow
who
was
fond
of
chester
and
hoped
it
was
nothing
serious
tell
him
to
go
ahead
with
his
vacation
stillinger
said
and
not
to
worry
over
office
affairs
now
burns
wheeled
round
from
the
telephone
will
you
put
yourself
in
my
hands
do
you
honestly
think
i
such
an
abandoned
case
already
began
chester
unhappily
that
you
have
to
listen
to
me
ches
i
do
think
you
an
abandoned
case
nonsense
after
five
weeks
but
i
do
think
you
well
started
on
a
road
that
it
ruin
to
travel
you
began
it
way
back
last
winter
by
taking
that
headache
stuff
in
double
the
dose
i
gave
you
without
consulting
me
every
time
you
felt
a
trifle
below
par
that
why
i
took
it
away
from
you
you
felt
the
loss
of
it
and
you
were
an
easy
mark
for
gardner
dope
you
grown
so
dependent
on
that
already
that
going
to
have
a
fight
to
get
along
without
it
you
ca
fight
and
do
office
work
so
i
going
to
make
the
most
of
my
chance
during
this
fortnight
vacation
if
you
give
me
leave
if
you
wo
i
think
i
knock
you
down
and
get
you
where
i
want
you
that
he
smiled
a
smile
with
so
much
spirit
and
affection
in
it
that
chester
eyes
filled
to
his
own
astonishment
for
up
to
this
point
he
had
been
both
hurt
and
angry
after
a
moment
he
said
with
his
eyes
on
the
floor
but
in
a
different
tone
from
any
he
had
yet
used
go
ahead
red
i
try
to
prove
i
have
some
stuff
in
me
of
course
you
burns
hand
was
on
his
friend
shoulder
what
i
counting
on
prove
it
by
following
directions
to
the
letter
and
begin
by
coming
with
me
for
a
trip
into
the
country
i
have
to
see
a
case
before
i
go
to
bed
and
the
air
will
do
your
head
it
was
the
first
of
many
similar
trips
arthur
chester
may
fairly
have
been
said
to
spend
the
succeeding
fortnight
in
the
company
of
the
green
imp
and
its
driver
from
morning
till
night
and
often
in
the
night
itself
when
he
found
it
impossible
to
sleep
he
was
living
in
the
open
air
by
means
of
this
device
of
walking
also
he
did
an
increasing
amount
as
his
strength
grew
under
the
regimen
burns
insisted
upon
but
for
the
first
week
in
spite
of
all
the
help
his
physician
could
give
him
he
found
himself
indeed
involved
in
a
fierce
struggle
a
struggle
with
shaken
and
unmanageable
nerves
with
a
desperate
craving
for
the
soothing
uplifting
effect
of
the
drug
to
which
he
was
forced
to
admit
he
had
become
perilously
accustomed
with
a
black
depression
of
spirit
which
was
worse
than
anything
else
he
had
to
combat
it
was
at
the
worst
of
one
of
these
periods
of
darkness
that
alone
with
his
patient
upon
a
hilltop
where
the
two
had
climbed
leaving
the
green
imp
at
a
point
where
the
road
had
become
impossible
burns
said
suddenly
ches
i
believe
with
all
my
care
to
give
you
the
treatment
i
thought
you
needed
i
failed
to
point
out
the
most
potent
remedy
of
chester
shook
his
head
you
done
everything
red
all
the
with
me
i
so
pitiably
weak
so
much
weaker
than
i
ever
dreamed
i
could
be
i
ca
seem
to
care
whether
i
get
out
of
this
or
not
all
i
want
is
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
never
wake
the
last
words
came
under
his
breath
but
burns
heard
them
he
showed
no
sign
of
being
startled
though
this
mood
was
a
gloomier
one
than
he
had
yet
seen
his
patient
succumb
to
instead
he
went
on
talking
in
a
tone
of
confidence
i
ought
to
have
known
enough
to
apply
this
remedy
because
it
one
i
tried
myself
if
you
could
know
since
the
night
you
heard
me
make
a
certain
vow
what
a
time
i
had
with
myself
to
keep
it
understand
that
i
know
what
it
means
to
try
to
break
up
a
habit
mine
the
habit
of
years
with
my
temper
and
some
of
my
associations
intemperate
profanity
been
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
fall
into
when
things
went
wrong
out
would
come
the
oaths
like
water
out
of
a
spring
though
that
a
false
comparison
like
the
filth
out
of
a
sewer
i
better
we
all
swear
more
or
less
acknowledged
chester
his
head
in
his
hands
not
as
i
did
and
you
know
it
i
been
responsible
for
many
a
taking
it
up
though
i
did
realize
it
because
i
was
athletic
and
in
for
sports
with
them
they
thought
i
was
the
whole
thing
they
laughed
when
i
got
mad
and
ripped
out
a
lot
of
language
they
copied
it
but
i
never
heard
myself
as
others
hear
me
till
that
night
i
let
go
at
the
mother
who
ignorantly
murdered
her
boy
by
disobeying
orders
on
the
way
home
that
night
i
woke
up
came
to
myself
i
do
know
how
the
stars
were
unusually
bright
and
i
looked
up
at
them
and
thought
of
that
child
soul
going
back
to
its
maker
and
then
thought
of
my
curses
following
it
and
coming
to
his
a
silence
fell
when
burns
broke
it
it
was
in
a
voice
deep
with
feeling
the
next
words
i
sent
up
to
that
ear
were
in
a
different
shape
i
think
it
was
the
first
real
prayer
i
ever
said
since
the
little
parrot
prayers
my
mother
taught
me
that
was
the
first
it
has
been
the
last
i
do
suppose
i
say
much
that
would
sound
like
the
language
but
ches
what
i
do
believe
is
that
i
get
what
i
ask
for
that
help
to
fight
my
temptations
and
profanity
is
the
only
one
nor
the
toughest
one
to
chester
looked
up
for
a
moment
he
forgot
himself
and
his
wretchedness
it
hard
to
believe
it
you
red
talking
like
i
know
it
must
be
hard
but
it
ought
to
be
the
more
convincing
on
that
account
i
belong
to
a
profession
of
materialists
and
all
at
once
grown
to
seem
to
me
the
strangest
thing
in
life
that
a
man
who
studies
the
anatomy
of
this
body
of
ours
should
be
a
materialist
to
watch
its
workings
and
then
doubt
the
god
who
made
it
is
sheet
wilful
blindness
but
ches
i
got
my
eyes
open
at
last
the
god
who
made
me
is
up
there
and
he
knows
and
cares
how
i
go
on
with
the
job
as
for
answering
my
appeals
for
help
when
i
get
hard
pressed
the
biggest
sign
i
have
of
that
is
a
human
one
since
bobby
burns
came
to
sleep
in
that
little
bed
next
mine
it
been
a
whole
lot
easier
to
get
a
deep
sigh
was
chester
reply
to
this
he
had
a
small
boy
and
girl
of
his
own
for
their
sakes
and
winifred
he
knew
he
must
fight
this
fight
out
and
win
but
as
for
getting
tangible
help
from
the
creator
of
a
body
handicapped
by
nerves
like
his
he
began
to
say
this
but
burns
broke
in
upon
him
with
the
answer
he
would
least
have
expected
at
a
moment
like
this
a
great
ringing
laugh
the
sound
of
which
brought
the
slow
blood
to
chester
white
face
if
you
consider
wrecked
nerves
like
mine
a
laughing
matter
he
broke
out
but
burns
his
laugh
over
was
sober
again
and
his
voice
was
earnest

chester
do
make
him
responsible
for
your
nerves
they
were
wrecked
when
you
were
furnished
with
them
you
done
the
wrecking
yourself
by
breaking
pretty
nearly
every
law
that
governs
the
workings
of
the
human
machine
you
paying
the
penalty
but
going
to
get
the
upper
hand
from
now
on
in
spite
of
your
office
life
you
going
to
get
good
red
blood
in
your
veins
and
your
brains
the
worst
is
over
now
the
second
week
will
be
easier
but
what
i
trying
to
tell
you
is
that
you
get
that
upper
hand
a
lot
quicker
if
his
cheek
grew
hot
with
this
strange
unaccustomed
effort
at
putting
things
he
had
never
spoken
of
before
into
words
if
you
just
reach
up
and
take
hold
of
that
hand
that
according
to
my
new
belief
and
experience
is
ready
to
reach
down
to
you
it
stronger
than
yours
you
feel
the
upward
he
broke
off
and
got
to
his
feet
the
two
had
been
sitting
on
a
fallen
log
looking
off
over
the
hills
toward
a
distant
river
winding
its
blue
length
through
fields
of
living
green
i
was
exactly
cut
out
for
a
preacher
ches
he
added
after
a
minute
i
hope
my
talk
does
sound
to
you
like
i
a
pretty
poor
specimen
of
a
chap
to
be
setting
up
my
own
example
for
anybody
to
i
do
think
you
been
setting
up
your
own
example
chester
replied
he
pulled
himself
up
limply
from
the
log
yet
out
of
his
face
had
gone
the
black
look
which
had
been
there
when
he
came
up
the
hill
and
what
you
said
does
sound
like
to
me
red
it
sounds
more
like
red
pepper
burns
held
out
his
hand
his
big
warm
fingers
closed
hard
over
the
thin
cold
ones
which
met
them
then
the
two
men
without
more
words
went
away
down
the
hill
from
this
hour

the

of

end
of

himself
red
observed
james
macauley
junior
this
place
of
yours
looks
like
a
drunkard
he
glanced
around
him
as
he
spoke
the
criticism
certainly
found
justification
in
every
corner
no
more
neglected
office
could
have
been
discovered
belonging
to
any
practitioner
within
an
area
of
many
miles
i
suppose
it
does
rejoined
burns
from
the
depths
of
a
big
dusty
leather
chair
where
he
sat
stretched
in
an
attitude
expressing
extreme
fatigue
but
i
do
care
a
macauley
looked
at
him
his
eyes
were
closed
his
arms
lay
upon
the
chair
arms
relaxed
and
limp
for
the
first
time
his
friend
observed
what
might
have
been
noted
by
a
critical
eye
on
any
day
during
the
last
fortnight
the
lines
on
the
ordinarily
strong
face
were
deeper
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
the
cheeks
were
thinner
there
were
even
shadows
under
the
thick
eyelashes
which
outlined
the
lids
of
the
closed
eyes
look
here
old
man
macauley
cried
sudden
conviction
seizing
him
you
working
altogether
too
hard
this
miserable
city
epidemic
has
done
you
out
i
thought
all
the
time
you
were
trying
to
cover
too
much
ground
had
to
be
covered
replied
the
other
briefly
without
opening
his
eyes
have
the
other
fellows
worked
as
hard
as
you
i
do
believe
it
they
all
city
men
you
done
all
this
city
work
and
looked
after
your
own
patients
here
too
to
say
nothing
of
living
in
both
places
at
once
with
your
housekeeper
gone
home
to
her
sick
folks
and
miss
mathewson
off
on
one
of
your
cases
no
wonder
this
place
looks
the
way
it
it
does
matter
cut
it
out
about
the
place
i
going
back
in
ten
you
are
not
going
to
get
to
bed
do
know
i
might
snatch
a
nap
now
if
you
quit
macauley
closed
his
mouth
presently
he
got
up
and
stole
out
of
the
room
he
was
back
again
in
a
trice
a
flask
in
one
hand
a
soda
siphon
in
the
other
and
a
small
glass
balanced
on
his
thumb
when
burns
at
the
sound
of
a
clock
ticking
somewhere
rubbed
his
eyes
with
his
fists
striking
in
and
reluctantly
opened
them
macauley
spoke
briskly
see
here
i
going
to
give
you
a
bracer
i
know
your
confounded
notions
but
they
do
cut
any
figure
when
you
need
something
to
pull
you
together
the
way
you
do
he
started
to
measure
out
the
amber
liquid
into
the
glass
but
burns
put
up
a
hand
much
obliged
but
i
do
want
you
idiot
do
you
know
when
to
make
an
exception
to
your
rule
i
admit
you
won
out
over
the
other
fellows
just
by
keeping
a
steady
hand
but
you
dead
as
a
dog
for
rest
and
you
need
a
stiff
one
if
i
any
you
not
for
burns
sat
up
o
heavens
man
if
i
were
going
to
break
my
rule
at
all
it
would
be
for
a
drink
of
anything
it
would
be
for
a
stab
in
the
arm
with
something
that
beats
your
stuff
all
out
for
stimulating
the
fatigue
out
of
a
fellow
and
making
him
feel
like
working
till
he
why
do
you
have
it
then
asked
macauley
curiously
i
should
think
if
ever
a
chap
were
justified
in
do
give
me
that
talk
if
you
my
friend
it
hard
enough
to
hold
out
without
resorting
to
that
game
i
do
need
you
to
advise
it
seen
enough
of
that
sort
of
suicide
buller
and
fields
are
both
down
and
out
and
they
began
to
brace
early
in
the
epidemic
van
horn
a
wreck
though
he
keeps
going
and
i
tell
you
i
more
respect
for
that
man
than
i
ever
had
before
he
a
poseur
and
a
toadier
no
doubt
of
that
and
i
always
despised
him
for
it
but
he
has
real
ability
and
he
worked
like
a
fiend
through
this
muss
and
not
all
for
his
rich
patients
either
but
he
weakening
fast
and
it
drug
stimulation
that
done
it
no
sir
not
for
mine
but
i
make
myself
a
cup
of
coffee
for
i
got
to
keep
awake
and
i
shall
sleep
in
my
tracks
if
i
he
got
up
and
stumbled
out
into
his
deserted
kitchen
macauley
followed
helping
as
best
he
knew
how
and
watched
his
friend
gulp
down
two
cupfulls
of
a
muddy
liquid
with
feeling
of
admiration
such
as
a
small
act
of
large
significance
may
sometimes
stir
in
one
who
apprehends
two
days
later
burns
starting
toward
home
in
the
imp
at
a
late
hour
in
the
morning
passed
a
figure
on
a
corner
of
a
city
street
waiting
for
the
trolley
he
slowed
down
beside
it
may
i
take
you
home
he
asked
cap
in
hand
and
interest
showing
in
eyes
which
a
moment
before
had
been
heavy
with
fatigue
ellen
lessing
looked
up
i
shall
be
very
glad
she
answered
as
she
met
his
outstretched
hand
and
let
it
draw
her
upward
to
the
vacant
seat
the
car
is
always
so
full
at
this
hour
and
i
was
longing
for
the
feeling
of
the
wind
against
my
it
cool
for
late
august
and
you
get
a
breeze
on
the
road
home
that
will
refresh
you
you
have
touched
water
or
milk
in
this
district
i
hope
no
indeed
martha
warned
me
a
dozen
times
before
i
left
how
are
things
any
better
no
new
cases
in
hours
and
the
old
ones
well
in
hand
getting
home
earlier
than
i
done
for
a
month
and
hope
to
have
a
few
hours
off
duty
i
was
planning
what
to
do
with
them
as
i
came
upon
i
should
think
you
could
do
nothing
better
with
them
than
to
go
home
and
sleep
she
advised
looking
up
at
his
face
with
a
critical
friendly
survey
of
the
signs
of
weariness
written
plainly
there
you
are
worn
out
and
that
means
something
when
one
says
it
of
so
strong
a
man
as
i
could
sleep
a
week
but
i
not
sure
that
a
few
hours
would
more
than
aggravate
my
need
besides
i
should
be
at
home
an
hour
before
i
should
be
called
out
again
no
my
plans
were
forming
themselves
differently
and
now
that
i
met
you
they
taking
definite
shape
i
want
well
suppose
i
do
tell
you
would
you
trust
me
to
take
you
off
on
a
expedition
without
explaining
what
i
mean
to
do
on
a
expedition
she
repeated
doctor
burns
are
you
sure
you
had
better
go
on
that
alone
suppose
i
chatter
all
the
way
he
smiled
you
not
a
chatterer
and
i
do
want
to
go
alone
i
have
had
a
chance
for
an
hour
with
you
for
a
month
i
think
this
is
the
only
way
i
can
get
it
will
you
go
you
provoke
my
curiosity
yes
i
think
i
go
i
been
shopping
all
the
morning
and
i
deserve
a
reward
of
rest
if
you
sure
you
know
where
to
find
he
turned
the
imp
abruptly
aside
from
the
boulevard
leading
out
of
town
down
which
they
had
been
speeding
he
made
a
detour
of
certain
side
streets
which
brought
him
up
before
a
small
side
establishment
bearing
a
sign
which
set
forth
an
alluring
invitation
to
motoring
parties
in
need
of
food
he
disappeared
therein
and
was
absent
for
the
space
of
a
full
twenty
minutes
when
he
returned
he
was
followed
by
a
waiter
with
a
hamper
to
whose
bestowal
in
the
back
of
the
car
he
looked
carefully
as
they
sped
away
again
burns
turned
to
his
companion
a
smile
of
anticipation
on
his
face
to
meet
a
glance
of
some
apprehension
you
not
repenting
your
rash
trust
of
me
already
are
you
he
demanded
i
remembering
that
martha
has
four
guests
at
luncheon
and
expects
me
to
be
there
is
that
all
do
let
that
worry
you
we
simply
have
a
breakdown
somewhere
on
the
road
conveniently
near
to
a
spot
i
know
where
i
can
broil
the
beefsteak
i
have
in
that
hamper
and
make
the
coffee
detention
will
be
your
temptation
will
be
my
confession
she
admitted
not
good
at
subterfuge
and
i
so
hungry
that
the
mere
mention
of
beefsteak
if
it
weighs
against
the
plates
and
salads
of
a
woman
luncheon
i
shall
have
a
great
respect
for
you
come
on
let
run
away
you
from
social
duties
i
from
professional
ones
i
agree
to
stand
out
martha
in
your
defense
unless
of
course
the
opportunity
to
wear
a
pretty
frock
and
throw
all
the
other
women
in
the
shade
she
laughed
that
precisely
what
martha
wants
me
to
do
then
fail
her
and
let
the
other
women
win
it
too
late
to
repent
anyhow
for
here
where
we
turn
the
imp
itself
seemed
to
be
running
away
so
swiftly
and
silently
it
covered
the
new
road
leading
off
into
the
hills
presently
it
was
climbing
them
i
want
to
get
where
no
monotonously
repeating
can
get
hold
of
me
the
imp
driver
explained
i
suppose
you
not
dressed
nor
shod
for
a
rough
walk
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
where
the
car
ca
go
i
sacrifice
skirts
and
soles
she
promised
is
the
air
out
here
glorious
i
thought
i
was
tired
when
i
left
the
city
now
i
could
climb
that
hill
and
enjoy
that
precisely
what
we
do
then
there
a
view
from
the
top
worth
the
scramble
but
i
was
sure
you
be
game
for
it
perhaps
i
know
you
better
at
the
end
of
this
afternoon
than
i
do
now
is
there
a
jolly
athletic
girl
hidden
away
under
that
demure
manner
of
yours
i
seen
so
far
i
wonder
lead
the
way
up
that
hill
and
you
find
out
she
answered
with
a
challenging
flash
of
her
dark
eyes
he
lodged
the
imp
among
a
clump
of
pines
got
out
the
hamper
and
turned
to
his
companion
she
had
pulled
off
her
gloves
removed
hat
and
veil
and
folded
her
long
gray
coat
away
in
the
car
this
left
her
dressed
in
the
trim
gray
skirt
of
walking
length
and
the
gray
silk
blouse
she
had
worn
for
shopping
burns
looked
at
her
with
approval
transformed
by
magic
from
a
fashionable
lady
in
street
attire
to
a
girl
ready
for
the
woods
was
his
comment
i
glad
you
leave
off
the
hat
i
match
you
by
doffing
the
cap
now
are
we
a
pair
are
you
in
for
a
rush
up
that
first
slope
jove
i
not
half
so
tired
as
i
was
an
hour
ago
already
he
caught
her
hand
in
his
his
other
arm
through
the
hamper
handle
and
ran
with
her
up
the
slope
at
the
edge
of
the
steeper
climb
to
come
they
stopped
breathing
fast
this
is
the
way
to
begin
of
course
he
admitted
as
they
both
regained
their
breath
laughing
at
their
own
enthusiasm
but
i
could
resist
that
dash
a
sort
of
dash
for
freedom
now
we
take
it
more
they
worked
their
way
up
and
up
among
the
rocks
he
always
in
advance
reaching
down
a
muscular
right
arm
to
help
her
at
the
steeper
places
and
once
giving
her
a
knee
to
step
on
when
progress
could
be
made
only
up
the
straight
face
of
a
big
boulder
it
was
undoubtedly
a
stiff
climb
for
a
woman
but
she
showed
no
signs
of
flinching
and
though
her
cheeks
glowed
richly
and
her
wavy
black
locks
were
a
trifle
loosened
from
their
usual
order
when
at
last
she
set
foot
upon
the
plateau
at
the
top
she
showed
only
the
temporary
fatigue
to
be
expected
after
such
unusual
exertion
that
makes
the
blood
course
through
one
arteries
in
a
way
worth
while
was
his
comment
as
he
regarded
with
satisfaction
the
splendid
colour
in
her
checks
and
the
sparkle
in
her
eyes
talk
about
rest
that
the
way
to
get
it
burn
up
the
products
of
fatigue
replace
them
with
fresh
cells
full
of
oxygen
and
you
get
rejuvenation
look
at
that
stretch
of
country
before
us
is
that
worth
the
climb
it
glorious
i
often
looked
at
this
height
as
our
car
drove
by
on
the
road
over
there
and
wanted
to
climb
it
but
martha
and
jim
are
always
for
reeling
off
miles
and
so
i
thought
were
you
i
imagined
there
was
nobody
but
myself
to
care
for
and
i
thought
you
liked
the
porch
and
the
pretty
clothes
you
wear
there
better
than
anything
i
could
show
you
in
the
open
he
owned
with
a
laugh
not
that
i
have
enjoyed
that
porch
and
the
sight
of
the
clothes
they
do
seem
to
be
just
like
martha
and
somehow
though
i
ca
tell
why
i
wanted
to
ask
you
off
for
a
trip
like
this
but
never
was
sure
you
enjoy
it
i
glad
i
found
out
i
feel
as
if
i
wasted
the
he
fell
to
gathering
wood
for
his
fire
and
when
she
had
regained
her
breath
she
helped
him
in
spite
of
his
remonstrance
let
me
have
all
the
fun
too
she
begged
i
have
had
a
chance
like
this
for
four
years
i
used
to
camp
in
flannels
all
summer
long
in
the
roughest
sort
of
style
and
loved
it
dearly
i
could
stand
the
tension
of
a
long
social
winter
twice
as
well
as
the
other
women
on
account
of
he
understood
knowing
that
her
husband
had
occupied
a
prominent
official
position
which
called
upon
him
to
maintain
a
corresponding
place
in
the
society
of
the
city
in
which
they
had
lived
although
he
knew
her
to
be
still
under
thirty
he
realized
that
on
account
of
her
early
marriage
she
had
had
much
experience
in
the
world
of
affairs
it
was
this
aspect
of
her
he
had
always
borne
in
mind
as
he
had
seen
her
before
now
he
was
beginning
to
recognize
another
side
of
her
character
and
tastes
a
side
which
interested
him
even
more
than
the
other
had
done
like
a
pair
of
children
they
collected
their
firewood
racing
together
to
the
base
of
operations
with
armfuls
of
dry
sticks
when
there
was
a
big
pile
she
surprised
him
by
asking
to
be
allowed
to
make
the
fire
herself
i
prove
to
you
i
a
woodsman
she
asserted
and
when
she
had
performed
her
task
after
the
most
approved
fashion
of
the
skilled
camper
he
acknowledged
that
she
had
made
good
her
boast
as
the
smoke
cleared
away
in
the
direction
which
left
the
view
unobscured
and
the
spot
he
had
selected
for
the
free
from
smoke
he
grinned
approvingly
i
no
doubt
you
could
grill
the
steak
and
brew
the
coffee
with
equal
skill
he
admitted
but
i
not
going
to
let
you
that
my
job
i
want
to
prove
my
prowess
sit
down
on
that
log
please
and
oversee
she
watched
with
hungry
interest
while
he
also
gave
evidence
of
his
craft
it
could
hardly
be
the
first
time
that
a
hamper
had
been
packed
for
him
at
the
place
in
the
city
for
nothing
he
needed
had
been
left
out
even
to
a
big
bottle
of
spring
water
with
which
to
make
the
coffee
when
his
work
was
nearly
complete
she
spread
a
square
of
white
linen
upon
a
flat
rock
and
set
forth
the
other
contents
of
the
hamper
olives
and
bread
and
butter
crisp
and
cream
cheese
and
a
tin
of
biscuits
she
heated
the
plates
and
cups
before
the
fire
and
as
he
withdrew
his
steak
from
the
coals
she
set
a
smoking
hot
platter
before
him
and
offered
him
the
materials
for
seasoning
you
a
crack
camper
for
sure
he
declared
does
that
steak
look
fit
for
the
gods
or
not
how
the
coffee
clear
perfect
and
the
steak
looks
as
if
it
would
melt
in
one
mouth
oh
is
this
fun
how
glad
i
am
i
here
and
not
at
that
luncheon
she
consulted
a
tiny
watch
it
two
they
sitting
down
she
exulted
martha
has
waited
half
an
hour
for
me
and
given
me
up
and
she
perfectly
furious
i
wicked
enough
to
feel
that
that
fact
is
going
to
make
this
meal
taste
all
the
better
stolen
steak
and
bread
and
butter
eaten
in
secret
have
an
extra
relish
no
doubt
of
that
here
this
juicy
bit
is
for
you
to
begin
on
set
your
teeth
into
it
partner
how
that
for
food
i
ask
of
you
sitting
on
the
ground
opposite
each
other
with
the
flat
rock
between
they
consumed
this
arcadian
banquet
eating
with
the
zest
born
of
exertion
and
the
open
air
the
sunshine
and
the
comradeship
nothing
has
tasted
quite
so
good
to
me
in
a
year
said
she
when
the
steak
had
vanished
dipping
a
white
in
salt
and
biting
the
end
off
with
teeth
still
whiter
nothing
ever
tasted
so
good
to
me
said
he
leaning
on
his
elbow
and
spreading
a
crisp
biscuit
with
a
layer
of
cheese
i
always
think
that
of
each
meal
i
eat
in
a
place
like
this
but
this
one
seems
to
have
a
special
flavour
i
wonder
if
it
can
be
the
company
he
smiled
across
at
her
the
sunshine
among
the
pine
needles
of
the
tree
above
him
throwing
flecks
of
bright
copper
among
the
thick
locks
of
his
hair
i
think
the
company
is
usually
an
important
part
of
all
such
outings
she
admitted
frankly
i
never
took
one
before
in
the
society
of
a
wornout
doctor
who
began
to
look
like
a
boy
again
before
he
had
finished
his
coffee
i
really
should
know
you
were
the
same
person
who
invited
me
to
go
on
this
there
nothing
like
it
for
renewing
one
body
and
mind
actual
physical
repose
is
often
the
best
cure
for
weariness
it
change
of
thought
and
occupation
particularly
if
the
open
air
is
a
part
of
the
cure
i
forgotten
i
have
a
care
in
the
world
all
i
can
think
of
is
may
i
say
it
yourself
i
ca
get
over
the
wonder
of
seeing
you
turn
from
what
bob
calls
his
lady
into
the
girl
i
see
before
me
a
girl
who
looks
about
nineteen
with
a
capacity
for
good
sport
in
the
open
air
i
never
dreamed
the
open
air
would
renew
everybody
youth
i
think
if
everybody
would
go
to
living
we
through
are
we
there
is
a
crumb
left
now
please
go
off
and
let
me
clear
up
and
pack
away
that
always
the
woman
part
could
you
lie
down
on
that
inviting
carpet
of
needles
over
there
under
the
big
pine
and
get
a
bit
of
sleep
sleep
when
i
can
talk
to
you
she
nodded
yes
indeed
i
not
going
to
talk
just
now
anyhow
so
you
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
throw
yourself
down
with
your
hands
under
your
head
and
look
up
at
those
beautiful
boughs
please
rather
reluctantly
he
obeyed
and
she
could
see
that
weary
as
he
undoubtedly
still
was
in
spite
of
the
refreshing
meal
he
really
did
not
want
to
lose
any
of
her
society
lying
at
full
length
on
his
side
his
head
propped
on
his
hand
talking
in
the
lazy
tone
of
content
which
had
descended
upon
him
he
continued
to
watch
her
as
she
repacked
the
hamper
it
was
not
until
she
deliberately
forsook
him
that
he
gave
up
to
her
wishes
but
when
having
been
out
of
his
sight
for
ten
minutes
she
peered
cautiously
through
the
bushes
behind
which
she
had
screened
herself
she
saw
what
she
had
hoped
for
his
whole
weary
frame
was
stretched
upon
the
carpet
the
lines
of
his
face
were
relaxed
and
his
eyes
fast
shut
the
sun
was
far
down
the
hills
when
he
awoke
he
lay
blinking
at
the
boughs
above
him
for
a
little
without
realizing
where
he
was
then
as
the
midsummer
stillness
which
surrounded
him
took
hold
of
his
senses
he
turned
his
head
to
recall
to
himself
the
conditions
under
which
he
had
been
sleeping
only
the
hamper
under
a
tree
close
by
gave
evidence
that
he
was
here
by
his
own
volition
he
stared
about
remembering
that
he
had
had
a
companion
he
got
somewhat
stiffly
to
his
feet
discovering
as
he
did
so
that
he
had
lain
for
a
long
time
without
stirring
from
the
position
in
which
slumber
had
overtaken
him
mrs
lessing
he
called
from
some
distance
away
came
back
a
blithe
answer
here
doctor
burns
he
started
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
and
presently
came
upon
her
sitting
on
a
big
granite
boulder
busy
with
a
lapful
of
pine
cones
out
of
which
she
seemed
to
be
constructing
something
she
looked
up
smiling
why
in
the
world
did
you
let
me
sleep
all
the
afternoon
he
reproached
her
i
should
have
wakened
you
in
ten
minutes
more
have
i
made
you
late
for
your
work
i
understood
that
you
could
afford
a
few
hours
for
rest
you
only
slept
three
good
heavens
when
i
might
have
been
spending
them
with
you
he
looked
so
chagrined
that
her
smile
changed
into
outright
laughter
you
are
very
flattering
but
i
been
taking
much
more
satisfaction
in
your
repose
than
i
could
possibly
have
done
in
your
society
no
matter
how
brilliant
you
might
have
that
not
flattering
but
i
admit
it
has
its
practical
side
those
three
hours
sleep
in
the
open
air
have
put
me
on
my
feet
again
just
the
same
i
want
to
eat
my
cake
and
have
it
too
promise
me
three
consecutive
hours
of
your
company
when
i
awake
or
i
sha
get
over
regretting
what
i
missed
will
you
do
this
again
with
me
some
september
day
when
i
can
make
the
time
i
promise
with
pleasure
i
had
a
charming
afternoon
all
by
myself
and
wandered
all
over
the
hillside
dreaming
midsummer
we
must
go
must
we
she
stood
up
her
hands
full
of
her
work
tell
me
some
of
them
wo
you
while
we
climb
down
to
the
car
he
begged
my
happiest
one
she
said
as
they
descended
is
the
making
of
a
country
home
for
little
crippled
children
i
think
i
found
the
spot
the
old
fairmount
place
it
not
more
than
five
miles
from
here
if
i
can
only
buy
it
at
a
reasonable
figure
mrs
lessing
he
broke
in
so
that
the
sort
of
thing
that
makes
your
no
wonder
well
why
should
you
be
surprised
is
that
a
delightful
dream
if
i
can
only
make
it
come
true
you
can
do
you
want
a
visiting
surgeon
of
course
i
do
will
you
why
lessing
said
he
stopping
short
just
below
her
on
the
steep
path
and
looking
up
into
her
face
with
eyes
of
eager
pleasure
been
one
of
my
dreams
so
long
i
ca
remember
when
i
began
to
think
about
it
but
i
have
been
able
to
finance
it
yet
nor
to
find
time
to
get
anybody
else
to
do
it
if
you
provide
the
place
i
do
everything
i
can
to
make
it
a
success
there
are
no
less
than
four
children
this
minute
i
longing
to
get
into
such
a
home
we
go
into
partnership
if
you
take
me
i
why
you
see
i
ca
even
talk
straight
about
it
and
you
i
thought
you
were
a
society
woman
i
am
a
society
woman
i
suppose
she
answered
laughing
though
our
ideas
might
differ
as
to
what
that
term
stands
for
but
why
should
that
prevent
my
caring
for
this
lovely
plan
evidently
it
does
how
many
sides
have
you
anyhow
i
found
out
two
new
ones
girl
and
patron
saint
ah
do
make
fun
of
me
i
no
girl
and
very
far
from
any
kind
of
saint
please
help
me
down
this
drop
as
if
i
were
a
very
very
old
lady
for
my
head
is
dizzy
with
joy
that
i
found
somebody
to
care
for
my
he
leaped
down
and
held
up
his
arms
come
grandma
he
invited
his
face
full
of
mischief
and
enthusiasm
and
happiness
i
think
i
play
girl
after
all
she
refused
gaily
and
accepting
one
hand
only
swung
herself
lightly
down
to
his
side
and
it
the
fellows
think
they
need
to
put
the
heart
back
into
them
jeered
red
pepper
burns
to
himself
let
them
try
the
open
country
and
a
comrade
like
this
if
there
is
another
anywhere
on
earth
but
they
ca
have
her
chapter
vii
in
which
he
continues
to
saw
wood
here
you
are
at
last
red
you
sinner
and
i
the
loser
ches
and
i
had
a
bet
on
since
we
saw
the
green
imp
tear
off
just
as
the
first
guests
were
coming
i
vowed
it
was
a
fake
call
and
you
never
get
back
till
the
musicians
were
their
i
knew
he
would
do
us
a
trick
like
that
declared
arthur
chester
with
an
affectionate
hand
on
burns
arm
not
that
i
have
blamed
you
on
a
night
like
this
what
people
want
to
give
dances
for
in
august
with
the
thermometer
at
the
top
of
the
tree
i
do
go
along
in
old
man
and
see
the
ladies
take
out
pauline
lessing
is
dancing
make
a
engagement
with
the
lovely
widow
then
bolt
out
here
that
my
advice
urged
macauley
much
obliged
i
will
would
have
come
if
winifred
had
cornered
she
doing
her
duty
by
pauline
and
she
considers
her
duty
is
done
till
she
secured
the
men
pauline
wants
but
i
say
when
you
get
a
look
at
ellen
you
forget
the
rivulets
coursing
down
your
neck
it
the
first
time
she
worn
anything
not
suggestive
of
past
experiences
only
white
tonight
but
macauley
pause
was
eloquent
burns
pushed
on
into
the
house
through
whose
open
doors
and
windows
came
sounds
of
revelry
a
stringed
orchestra
was
playing
somewhere
out
of
sight
and
to
its
music
the
late
arrival
holding
his
head
well
up
that
he
might
keep
his
collar
intact
until
the
latest
possible
moment
set
his
course
toward
his
hostess
outside
in
the
bower
which
had
been
made
of
the
porch
chester
disgracefully
shuffling
off
the
duties
of
host
and
lounging
with
macauley
and
two
or
three
other
of
the
young
married
men
reported
through
the
window
the
progress
of
the
victim
led
to
the
sacrifice
he
shouldered
his
way
to
win
he
shaking
hands
and
trying
not
to
look
hot
hi
pauline
sighted
him
already
she
making
for
him
like
the
arrow
to
the
or
the
bullet
for
the
hippopotamus
suggested
macauley
under
his
breath
in
chester
ear
he
too
began
to
reconnoiter
he
asking
her
if
she
saved
the
first
one
for
him
and
she
telling
him
she
did
till
the
last
minute
her
card
is
full
now
but
he
shall
have
the
last
half
of
this
next
one
does
he
look
overjoyed
chester
chuckled
wickedly
where
ellen
why
is
she
on
deck
now
just
as
red
comes
macauley
began
to
fume
she
behaved
nobly
all
the
evening
so
far
she
might
have
a
rational
being
how
for
a
partner
as
her
reward
but
i
presume
she
sitting
out
somewhere
with
that
chump
of
a
wardlaw
he
follows
her
like
a
shadow
and
she
too
kindhearted
to
shake
him
she
a
voice
speaking
softly
from
the
lawn
below
the
porch
interrupted
him
is
doctor
burns
urns
here
it
asked
chester
went
over
to
the
rail
he
only
just
come
you
know
miss
mathewson
you
do
have
to
call
him
out
this
minute

tell
to
get
somebody

like
it
they
special
friends
of
oh
well
i
suppose
he
see
the
bright
side
of
getting
out
of
that
turkish
bath
in
there
but
i
must
say
i
wish
i
did
have
to
pull
through
this
whole
affair
without
his
support
grumbled
chester
as
he
went
in
to
find
burns
now
disappeared
into
the
inner
rooms
where
the
music
came
from
red
pepper
came
out
looking
the
name
more
than
usual
for
three
rounds
of
the
floor
had
brought
as
it
seemed
to
him
every
drop
of
blood
to
his
face
and
his
hair
clung
damply
to
his
brow
he
held
a
brief
colloquy
with
his
office
nurse
no
way
out
i
have
to
go
ches
said
he
with
joy
but
you
hustle
you
make
one
more
try
of
it
begged
chester
this
thing
wo
break
up
early
not
with
pauline
pushing
it

back
in
time
to
be
taken
out
and
fed
try
to
and
burns
disappeared
off
the
end
of
the
porch
lucky
dog
gloomed
macauley
the
call
five
miles
out
on
the
road
to
the
city
i
like
to
be
in
the
green
imp
for
the
spin
red
make
of
it
by
george
i
he
broke
off
suddenly
gave
a
hasty
look
around
and
bolted
off
the
end
of
the
porch
into
the
semidarkness
of
the
lawn
he
ran
across
behind
the
houses
to
his
own
back
porch
procured
a
dustcoat
from
within
and
dashed
back
regardless
of
the
bodily
heat
he
was
generating
as
the
green
imp
backed
out
of
the
barn
macauley
swung
himself
into
the
unoccupied
seat
burns
also
in
pulled
on
over
his
evening
clothes
grinned
cheerfully
deserter
he
queried
you
be
back
within
the
hour
wo
you
less
than
that
probably
the
imp
running
like
a
bird
show
you
her
paces
when
we
get
out
hi
there
who
that
chasing
us
well
of
all
the
you
too
ches
panting
chester
flung
himself
upon
the
just
as
the
car
turned
out
of
the
yard
had
a
hunt
for
my
coat
nearly
lost
you
he
gasped
burns
stopped
the
car
see
here
sonny
he
expostulated
you
happen
to
be
host
you
know
i
might
be
detained
out
there
though
i
expect
i
take
the
trolley
back
if
you
are
replied
chester
settling
himself
i
ca
stand
it
to
see
you
fellows
cut
away
out
of
the
and
not
go
too
i
take
my
so
be
it
and
laughing
with
a
glance
back
at
the
gaily
lighted
house
burns
sent
the
car
on
her
course
you
two
are
always
bragging
up
the
married
life
he
remarked
as
the
green
imp
gathered
speed
but
it
strikes
me
you
pretty
eager
to
get
away
from
the
glories
of
your
wives
it
one
curious
thing
admitted
macauley
thoughtfully
that
no
matter
how
harmonious
a
couple
may
be
they
bound
to
differ
on
what
does
and
does
not
constitute
of
course
a
girl
like
pauline
always
wants
to
dance
no
matter
how
torrid
the
night
explained
chester
win
and
i
have
to
consider
our
guest
wish
but
you
can
bet
pauline
is
getting
her
wish
not
with
burns
running
around
the
country
all
the
evening
and
only
making
stops
at
her
by
the
speed
with
which
the
green
imp
swallowed
the
ground
it
looked
as
if
burns
might
make
several
such
trips
and
still
interpolate
a
number
of
stops
before
the
affair
at
the
chester
house
should
be
over
before
his
passengers
were
well
aware
of
the
distance
they
had
covered
he
pulled
up
in
front
of
a
small
cottage
they
settled
themselves
comfortably
to
await
a
stay
but
in
five
he
was
out
again
both
dust
coat
and
clawhammer
were
off
his
sleeves
were
rolled
to
the
elbow
i
in
for
it
boys
he
said
ca
get
away
under
two
hours
at
the
shortest
sorry
but
they
did
let
me
know
what
they
wanted
me
for
and
i
caught
you
have
to
drive
home
call
up
johnny
caruthers
and
let
him
bring
back
the
imp
and
miss
mathewson
i
ca
be
spared
long
enough
to
go
myself
so
take
her
this
note
to
tell
her
what
to
bring
get
busy
he
handed
macauley
a
hasty
scrawl
on
a
prescription
blank
and
smiled
at
the
discomfited
faces
of
his
two
friends
showing
plainly
in
the
lights
which
streamed
from
the
house
you
look
blamed
pleased
over
your
job
growled
macauley
i
like
the
job
all
right
admitted
burns
particularly
when
contrasted
with
you
would
say
it
if
you
caught
one
glimpse
of
called
back
chester
as
the
imp
responded
somewhat
erratically
to
unaccustomed
touch
but
all
the
answer
they
got
was
an
emphatic
change
gears
as
if
you
were
running
a
thrashing
machine
it
was
two
hours
and
a
half
later
that
burns
came
out
of
the
small
cottage
again
wiping
a
damp
face
his
white
a
pathetic
ruin
his
hastily
reassumed
white
waistcoat
and
tie
decidedly
the
worse
for
having
been
carelessly
handled
but
his
face
when
he
turned
it
toward
the
stars
as
he
crossed
the
tiny
patch
of
a
yard
was
a
contented
one
it
pays
up
all
the
arrears
when
you
can
leave
a
chunk
of
happiness
behind
you
as
big
as
that
one
he
said
to
himself
johnny
caruthers
had
gone
home
by
trolley
long
ago
and
miss
mathewson
was
to
remain
for
the
night
and
return
with
the
doctor
when
he
came
for
his
morning
burns
sent
the
green
imp
off
at
a
moderate
pace
musing
as
he
drove
through
the
now
moderated
and
refreshing
air
of
two
in
the
morning
party
must
be
about
over
by
now
think
it
adjourn
without
seeing
any
more
of
red
pepper
and
his
misused
dress
clothes
he
reflected
i
suppose
those
dancing
puppets
think
they
had
a
good
time
but
it
is
in
it
with
mine
bless
the
little
woman
she
happy
over
her
first
boy
he
a
winner
too
as
for
tom
i
could
have
tipped
him
over
with
a
nod
of
the
head
when
he
was
thanking
me
for
leaving
the
to
stand
by
it
must
feel
pretty
good
to
be
the
father
of
a
promising
specimen
like
that
must
beat
the
adopting
business
several
leagues
and
that
not
saying
that
bobby
burns
is
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
philosophizing
thus
he
presently
sent
the
green
imp
at
her
quietest
pace
in
at
the
home
driveway
the
chester
house
was
still
brilliantly
illumined
his
own
dark
except
for
the
dim
light
in
the
office
and
he
discovered
it
as
he
rounded
the
turn
a
sort
of
coming
from
the
windows
of
his
own
room
where
bob
slept
in
the
small
bed
beside
his
own
burns
gazed
anxiously
at
this
for
it
showed
that
somebody
had
turned
on
the
hooded
electric
he
was
accustomed
to
leave
the
door
open
into
his
private
office
in
which
a
light
was
always
burning
and
with
this
bob
had
hitherto
been
satisfied
he
must
have
waked
up
and
called
for
cynthia
he
decided
housing
the
imp
he
quietly
crossed
the
lawn
to
the
window
avoiding
any
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
gravelled
paths
both
windows
screened
by
wire
and
awnings
were
wide
open
he
could
see
with
ease
into
the
room
for
the
house
was
an
old
one
and
stood
low
climbing
wistaria
vines
wreathed
the
windows
and
sheltered
by
these
he
found
himself
secure
from
observation
for
after
the
first
look
he
became
exceedingly
anxious
not
to
be
discovered
he
had
come
home
in
the
stirred
and
gentle
mood
often
brought
upon
him
by
his
part
in
such
a
scene
as
the
one
he
had
lately
left
behind
him
in
the
first
wave
of
joy
swept
by
a
birth
into
a
home
whether
humble
or
exalted
the
man
who
has
been
of
service
in
the
hour
of
trial
is
often
caught
and
lifted
into
a
sympathetic
pleasure
which
lasts
for
some
time
after
he
has
gone
on
to
less
satisfying
work
burns
had
often
jeered
gently
at
himself
for
being
as
he
considered
more
than
ordinarily
susceptible
to
a
sort
of
odd
tenderness
of
feeling
under
such
conditions
and
as
he
stared
in
at
the
scene
before
him
he
was
uneasily
conscious
that
he
could
not
have
come
upon
it
at
a
more
vulnerable
moment
bobby
burns
was
sitting
straight
up
in
bed
his
cheeks
flushed
his
eyelids
reddened
as
if
with
prolonged
crying
but
his
small
face
radiant
with
happiness
as
he
regarded
his
companion
his
plump
little
fist
thrust
tight
into
the
hand
which
held
his
in
a
chair
close
beside
him
sat
a
figure
in
silvery
white
bare
arms
from
which
the
gloves
had
been
pulled
and
flung
aside
upon
the
bed
gleaming
in
the
glow
from
the
hooded
light
black
head
was
close
to
black
head
her
black
lashes
and
his
disclosed
dark
eyes
curiously
alike
in
the
distracting
glance
of
them
even
the
colouring
of
the
faces
was
similar
for
both
showed
the
warm
and
peachy
hues
laid
there
by
the
summer
sun
they
might
easily
be
mother
and
son
was
the
thought
forced
upon
the
spectator
his
own
cheek
suddenly
burned
in
the
shadow
of
the
wistaria
vines
he
listened
abstractedly
to
the
conclusion
of
the
story
it
must
have
been
a
charming
tale
for
the
boy
cry
of
regret
when
it
ended
was
eloquent
but
the
eavesdropper
heard
with
full
appreciation
the
richness
of
the
low
voice
and
could
not
wonder
at
bob
delight
in
it
he
watched
with
absorbed
eyes
the
embrace
exchanged
between
the
two
and
forgetting
to
be
cautious
allowed
his
shifted
foot
to
crunch
the
gravel
under
the
window
quicker
than
thought
the
light
went
out
burns
made
for
the
office
door
consumed
with
eagerness
to
catch
her
before
she
could
get
away
but
when
he
set
foot
upon
the
threshold
of
his
room
only
the
little
figure
pulling
itself
again
erect
in
the
bed
met
his
eyes
in
the
dim
light
issuing
from
the
office
and
otherwise
the
room
was
empty
nobody
heard
me
cryin
but
her
explained
bob
to
his
questioning
guardian
cynthia
was
all
goned
away
and
i
heard
the
fiddles
and
they
made
me
cry
she
comed
in
and
told
me
stories
i
love
her
but
she
wented
awful
quick
out
that
he
pointed
toward
a
french
window
opening
like
a
door
upon
the
lawn
i
wish
she
did
go
so
quick
she
looked
awful
pretty
all
white
and
shiny
she
loves
me
i
think
you
of
course
old
man
that
your
particular
good
luck
eh
now
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
tell
me
all
about
it
in
the
are
you
going
back
to
the
party
queried
bob
anxiously
burns
glanced
humorously
down
at
his
attire
but
i
not
going
to
bed
just
yet
so
shut
your
eyes
i
not
be
far
the
child
obeyed
exchanging
the
for
his
office
coat
burns
went
out
by
way
of
the
french
window
to
the
rear
of
the
house
an
hour
afterward
arthur
chester
putting
out
lights
discovered
from
a
back
window
a
familiar
figure
at
a
familiar
occupation
but
at
this
hour
of
the
night
the
sight
struck
him
as
so
extraordinary
that
curiosity
afire
he
hurriedly
let
himself
out
of
the
side
door
he
had
just
locked
and
crossed
the
lawn
in
the
name
of
all
lunatics
red
why
sawing
wood
it
ca
be
ill
temper
at
missing
the
show
in
the
august
moonlight
the
figure
straightened
itself
and
laid
down
the
saw
go
to
bed
and
do
bother
your
addle
pate
about
your
neighbours
ca
a
man
cut
up
a
few
sticks
without
your
coming
to
investigate
saw
a
few
more
you
have
got
the
full
dose
necessary
yet
advised
chester
his
hands
in
his
pockets
want
me
to
sit
up
with
you
till
you
work
it
all
off
it
beginning
to
look
as
if
it
would
work
off
muttered
burns
must
be
a
worse
attack
than
usual
how
long
have
you
been
at
it
do
sawed
that
whole
heap
at
the
side
there
suppose
lost
a
patient
blow
out
a
tire
bad
news
of
any
sort
no
go
to
i
feel
i
ought
to
leave
you
persisted
chester
do
you
think
it
might
ease
your
mind
to
tell
me
about
it
burns
came
at
him
with
the
saw
and
chester
fled
burns
went
back
to
his
woodpile
marshalled
the
sawed
sticks
into
orderly
ranks
then
stood
still
once
more
and
once
more
looked
up
at
the
stars
if
an
hour
of
that
on
a
night
like
this
wo
take
the
nonsense
out
of
me
he
solemnly
explained
to
a
bright
particular
planet
now
low
in
the
heavens
i
must
be
past
help
but
i
be
drawn
and
quartered
if
give
in
have
i
had
knockouts
enough
to
be
able
to
keep
my
head
this
time
red
pepper
burns
the
maine
now
go
to
bed
yourself
chapter
viii
in
which
he
is
unreasonably
preoccupied
red
pepper
burns
put
down
that
stuff
and
come
over
it
nine
and
pauline
goes
tomorrow
as
you
very
well
know
and
not
only
paul
but
lessing
paul
persuaded
her
to
start
when
she
does
though
she
was
expecting
to
go
for
three
days
burns
looked
up
abstractedly
ca
come
now
i
busy
he
replied
and
immediately
became
reabsorbed
in
the
big
book
he
was
studying
chester
gazed
at
him
amazedly
he
sat
at
the
desk
in
the
inner
office
surrounded
by
books
medical
magazines
foreign
reviews
in
both
french
and
german
as
chester
discovered
on
approaching
more
closely
by
loose
anatomical
plates
by
sheets
of
paper
covered
with
rough
sketches
of
something
it
looked
more
like
a
snake
in
convulsions
than
anything
else
evidently
burns
was
deep
in
some
sort
of
professional
research
it
was
not
that
the
sight
was
an
unaccustomed
one
there
could
be
no
question
that
burns
was
a
close
student
this
was
not
the
first
nor
the
fortieth
time
that
his
friend
had
thus
discovered
him
the
view
to
be
had
from
the
point
where
chester
stood
of
the
small
laboratory
opening
from
this
office
was
also
a
familiar
one
he
could
see
steam
arising
from
the
sterilizer
he
knew
surgical
instruments
were
boiling
merrily
away
there
a
table
was
littered
with
objects
suggesting
careful
examination
a
fine
microscope
in
position
a
centrifuge
bunsen
burners
elsewhere
other
apparatus
of
a
description
to
make
the
uninitiated
actively
sympathetic
with
the
presumable
coming
victim
the
point
of
the
situation
to
chester
was
that
astonishing
fact
that
burns
could
hear
unmoved
of
the
immediate
departure
of
ellen
lessing
he
made
up
his
mind
that
this
scientific
enthusiast
could
not
have
assimilated
the
dreadful
news
he
would
try
again
red
do
you
hear
she
going
tomorrow
let
her
go
do
bother
i
do
mean
pauline
ellen
going
burns
put
up
one
sinewy
hand
and
thrust
it
through
his
hair
which
already
stood
on
end
his
collar
was
off
and
he
wore
a
laboratory
apron
his
appearance
was
not
prepossessing
he
pulled
a
piece
of
paper
toward
him
and
began
to
make
rapid
lines
it
was
the
snake
again
in
worse
convulsions
than
before
evidently
he
had
not
heard
chester
approached
the
desk
red
he
shouted
the
patient
is
on
the
table
yet
he
wo
die
if
you
listen
to
me
one
minute
i
want
you
to
take
this
thing
in
lessing
knocking
the
sketch
to
one
side
and
precipitating
three
books
and
a
mass
of
papers
to
the
floor
red
stood
up
he
towered
above
his
shrinking
fiend
wrath
in
his
eye
his
lips
moved
if
it
had
been
three
months
earlier
chester
would
have
expected
to
hear
language
of
a
lurid
description
as
it
was
the
first
syllable
or
two
did
slip
out
but
no
more
followed
only
speech
good
vigorous
saxon
not
to
be
misunderstood
will
you
try
to
get
it
into
your
brain
that
i
do
care
a
hang
who
goes
or
where
so
long
as
i
figure
out
a
way
to
do
this
trick
the
other
fellows
all
say
it
ca
be
done
not
one
of
do
it
not
even
van
horn
i
say
it
can
and
i
going
to
do
it
morning
at
nine
if
i
can
work
out
a
tool
to
do
it
with
and
make
it
and
i
can
do
that
if
idiots
like
you
will
get
out
and
keep
he
sat
down
and
was
instantly
lost
again
in
his
effort
at
invention
chester
looked
at
him
in
silence
for
a
minute
more
then
he
walked
quietly
out
offended
not
he
he
had
not
listened
to
invective
from
that
celtic
tongue
for
eight
years
not
to
know
that
high
tension
over
a
coming
critical
operation
almost
invariably
meant
brilliant
success
but
even
he
had
never
seen
red
pepper
keyed
up
quite
so
taut
as
this
it
must
be
a
tremendous
risk
he
meant
to
take
success
to
him
the
queer
fine
old
boy
he
may
be
over
later
when
he
gets
that
confounded
snake
of
an
instrument
figured
chester
offered
this
to
the
group
upon
his
porch
as
consolation
and
if
he
does
get
it
figured
out
before
we
break
up
he
be
over
prophesied
macauley
ten
to
one
he
forgets
to
come
and
say
before
he
starts
for
the
hospital
in
the
i
going
to
be
standing
beside
the
driveway
when
he
goes
vowed
pauline
and
if
he
does
notice
me
i
climb
on
the
ellen
do
go
whispered
martha
macauley
to
her
sister
do
let
it
end
this
way
when
he
comes
to
you
be
gone
and
such
a
pity
just
but
i
think
i
would
rather
be
gone
ellen
lessing
whispered
back
oh
why
when
red
excited
over
a
big
success
he
simply
off
his
head
there
no
knowing
what
he
wo
i
prefer
him
when
he
has
his
head
do
urge
martha
i
promised
to
go
in
the
morning
with
pauline
and
nothing
could
make
me
it
a
shame
for
him
to
be
so
absorbed
who
wants
a
man
who
can
forget
the
existence
of
a
woman
like
that
who
wants
one
who
ca
a
sorry
surgeon
he
be
his
hand
would
shake
do
talk
about
it
any
more
dear
i
going
to
enjoy
this
evening
with
you
all
and
i
hope
oh
how
i
hope
that
operation
will
be
a
success
if
it
were
not
to
be
a
success
it
would
not
be
the
fault
of
the
man
who
worked
till
one
two
three
it
the
morning
to
perfect
the
strangely
convoluted
tool
which
was
to
help
do
the
trick
if
it
could
be
done
part
of
the
work
was
done
in
the
laboratory
part
in
the
machine
shop
which
occupied
a
corner
of
the
old
red
barn
where
the
green
imp
lent
her
lamps
as
aids
to
the
task
in
hand
at
four
the
instrument
finished
sterilized
and
put
away
as
if
it
were
worth
its
weight
in
gold
which
it
might
easily
have
been
if
it
were
to
prove
fitted
to
the
peculiar
need
burns
went
to
bed
at
six
he
was
up
again
had
a
cold
plunge
and
a
hearty
breakfast
and
at
seven
was
sending
the
imp
out
of
the
gateway
his
office
nurse
beside
him
if
lessing
hoped
the
operation
would
be
a
success
miss
mathewson
hoped
and
feared
and
longed
with
all
her
soul
beneath
the
uniform
and
behind
the
quiet
plain
face
of
the
young
woman
who
had
been
burns
professional
assistant
for
eight
years
lived
a
person
than
whom
none
cared
more
how
things
went
with
him
but
nobody
knew
that
least
of
all
burns
himself
he
only
knew
that
he
could
not
get
on
without
her
that
never
a
suture
that
she
had
prepared
made
trouble
for
him
after
an
operation
and
that
none
other
of
the
hundred
nice
details
upon
which
the
astounding
results
of
modern
surgery
depend
was
likely
to
go
wrong
if
it
were
she
who
was
responsible
at
five
that
afternoon
the
green
inn
came
back
arthur
chester
had
just
returned
from
the
office
and
had
thrown
himself
into
a
hammock
on
the
porch
for
the
september
weather
was
like
that
of
june
catching
the
throbbing
purr
of
the
imp
as
the
car
swung
in
at
the
driveway
chester
jumped
up
burns
flung
out
a
triumphant
arm
miss
mathewson
was
smiling
by
george
the
old
boy
won
out
chester
said
to
himself
and
hurried
down
to
meet
the
imp
all
over
but
the
shouting
red
he
questioned
eagerly
all
burns
face
was
aflame
pull
up
and
tell
me
about
the
car
came
to
a
standstill
nothing
to
tell
the
curve
i
got
on
that
bit
of
steel
did
the
work
around
the
corner
and
inside
out
the
fellows
said
it
would
stood
around
and
croaked
for
an
hour
beforehand
lord
i
have
died
myself
before
i
have
failed
after
should
have
thought
they
have
unsettled
your
nerve
declared
chester
looking
as
if
he
would
like
personally
to
pitch
into
the
entire
medical
profession
did
just
made
me
mad
i
can
do
anything
when
i
mad
if
i
can
keep
my
mouth
burns
laughed
rather
shamefacedly
that
the
one
advantage
of
a
temper
i
say
ches
do
you
want
to
go
with
me
there
are
probably
half
a
dozen
calls
waiting
at
the
office
i
run
and
he
jumped
out
seized
his
surgical
handbags
and
hurried
away
miss
mathewson
descended
more
deliberately
chester
plying
her
with
eager
questions
as
he
assisted
her
how
was
it
pretty
big
feather
in
his
cap
miss
mathewson
indeed
it
was
chester
every
one
of
the
other
city
surgeons
said
it
could
be
done
without
killing
the
patient
they
all
admitted
that
if
she
survived
the
operation
she
would
have
every
chance
for
recovery
they
were
all
there
to
see
i
never
knew
them
all
there
at
once
it
would
be
ungenerous
to
imagine
they
wanted
him
to
fail
chuckled
chester
but
we
all
human
how
did
they
take
it
when
he
succeeded
they
remembered
they
were
gentlemen
and
scientists
declared
miss
mathewson
all
but
one
or
two
who
are
worth
mentioning
when
they
saw
he
had
done
it
they
began
to
clap
i
do
believe
there
was
ever
such
a
burst
of
applause
in
that
what
did
the
old
fellow
do
tried
to
look
modest
i
suppose
laughed
chester
glowing
with
pride
and
pleasure
he
was
white
all
through
the
operation
he
always
is
with
the
strain
but
he
turned
red
all
over
when
they
cheered
and
just
said
you
gentlemen
it
really
was
a
wonderful
thing
chester
even
in
these
days
only
one
man
has
done
it
a
german
and
he
has
done
it
only
twice
doctor
burns
will
be
distinguished
after
good
for
him
no
wonder
he
looks
the
way
he
does
as
if
he
like
to
turn
a
few
handsprings
chester
reflected
as
he
watched
the
trim
figure
walk
away
burns
came
back
jump
in
he
said
work
enough
to
keep
me
busy
till
bedtime
if
there
had
been
i
have
proposed
a
beefsteak
in
the
woods
by
way
of
a
celebration
and
a
let
down
i
beginning
to
get
a
bit
of
reaction
of
course
should
have
liked
an
hour
or
two
of
jollity
you
and
win
and
lessing
and
i
might
have
mrs
lessing
you
old
chump
do
you
remember
she
gone
why
mac
started
for
the
train
with
them
all
in
his
car
not
ten
minutes
before
you
came
they
have
been
gone
fifteen
i
begged
off
from
going
along
because
i
was
dusty
and
tired
just
got
home
burns
making
the
circuit
of
the
driveway
behind
the
houses
and
now
turning
the
imp
nose
toward
the
street
again
stared
at
his
friend
in
amazement
why
she
was
going
till
day
after
he
exclaimed
i
came
over
last
night
drawled
chester
in
a
longsuffering
tone
and
explained
to
you
and
shouted
at
you
and
tried
in
every
way
to
ram
the
idea
into
your
head
that
pauline
had
wheedled
lessing
to
start
when
she
did
because
their
routes
lay
together
as
far
as
washington
you
put
me
out
calling
me
names
and
generally
insulting
me
it
all
right
of
course
she
to
spend
the
winter
in
south
carolina
but
she
be
back
next
summer
you
can
say
to
her
then
it
do
just
as
burns
watch
was
in
his
hand
what
time
does
that
train
go
he
demanded
you
ca
make
chester
watch
was
also
out
what
do
you
care
send
her
a
picture
postcard
explaining
that
you
forgot
all
about
her
until
it
was
too
the
last
word
was
jerked
back
into
his
throat
by
the
jump
of
the
green
imp
she
shot
out
of
the
driveway
like
a
stone
out
of
a
catapult
and
was
off
down
the
mile
road
to
the
station
all
conveyances
going
to
that
train
had
passed
before
and
the
course
was
nearly
clear
there
the
train
smoke
at
the
tunnel
you
ca
do
it
asserted
chester
pointing
to
the
black
hole
a
few
rods
to
one
side
of
the
station
whence
a
gray
cloud
was
issuing
she
only
makes
a
two
minute
stop
you
wo
more
than
get
on
board
before
if
i
get
on
board
you
drive
into
the
city
and
meet
me
there
will
you
begged
burns
i
ca
drive
the
imp
red
you
know
i
then
johnny
caruthers
from
the
station
and
send
him
in
for
me
that
give
me
fifteen
minutes
on
the
what
the
use
pauline
be
at
your
elbow
every
minute
she
but
burns
was
paying
no
attention
he
was
taking
the
imp
past
a
lumbering
with
only
two
inches
to
spare
between
himself
and
the
ditch
then
the
car
was
at
the
station
burns
was
out
and
through
the
building
through
the
gate
and
upon
the
train
after
a
moment
hasty
argument
with
a
conductor
to
whom
he
could
show
no
ticket
on
the
platform
james
macauley
junior
and
martha
macauley
winifred
chester
and
four
small
children
of
assorted
ages
stared
after
the
big
figure
bolting
into
the
pullman
bobby
burns
gave
a
shriek
of
delight
followed
by
a
wail
of
disappointment
by
george
he
turned
up
after
all
exulted
macauley
and
the
two
women
looked
at
each
other
with
meaning
relieved
glances
in
the
car
the
passengers
observed
interestedly
the
spectacle
of
a
large
man
with
a
mop
of
fiery
red
hair
from
which
he
had
pulled
a
leather
cap
striding
into
the
car
and
up
to
the
two
prettiest
young
women
there
one
of
these
very
smartly
clad
in
blue
received
him
with
looks
half
gay
half
pouting
and
with
a
storm
of
talk
the
other
in
gray
with
a
face
upon
which
no
eye
could
rest
once
without
covertly
or
openly
returning
in
deference
to
its
charm
gave
him
a
quiet
hand
and
turned
away
again
to
wave
her
farewell
to
the
group
of
friends
on
the
platform
take
my
chair
and
i
perch
on
the
arm
of
ellen
commanded
pauline
while
you
explain
apologize
and
try
to
make
your
peace
with
us
you
find
it
hard
work
i
may
smile
for
the
sake
of
appearances
but
inside
i
really
awfully
angry
so
is
ellen
though
she
show
thus
pauline
indefinitely
prolonged
and
repeated
with
variations
interpolations
interruptions
it
did
matter
redfield
pepper
burns
heard
none
of
it
even
with
pauline
perching
on
the
arm
of
ellen
lessing
chair
her
face
within
eight
inches
of
the
other
face
she
was
not
within
the
field
of
his
vision
i
am
sure
the
operation
was
successful
said
lessing
one
can
see
it
in
his
eyes
declared
pauline
i
never
knew
hazel
eyes
could
be
so
it
went
through
admitted
burns
it
had
to
you
know
and
i
had
a
thing
to
make
last
arthur
told
us
about
it
chattered
pauline
it
was
like
a
sna
you
did
miss
my
not
coming
over
said
burns
he
was
leaning
forward
his
hands
on
his
knees
his
rumpled
head
near
enough
so
that
very
low
tones
could
reach
the
person
to
whom
he
spoke
he
did
not
once
look
at
pauline
one
would
have
thought
that
that
fact
alone
would
have
quieted
her
but
it
did
not
indeed
we
did
awfully
cried
pauline
neither
did
i
myself
then
lessing
i
miss
it
now
i
shall
miss
it
more
whenever
i
think
about
it
i
do
know
of
but
one
thing
that
can
possibly
make
it
up
to
name
it
you
do
deserve
it
but
our
hearts
are
rather
tender
and
we
might
grant
pauline
looked
arch
but
what
was
the
use
nobody
saw
even
the
passengers
were
watching
the
one
in
gray
spectators
always
watch
the
woman
at
whom
the
man
is
looking
and
in
this
case
it
seemed
well
worth
while
for
even
the
most
admirable
reserve
of
manner
could
not
control
the
colour
which
was
slowly
mounting
under
the
direct
and
continued
gaze
of
the
man
with
the
red
hair
the
man
himself
it
occurred
to
more
than
one
passenger
was
rather
well
worth
study
it
always
been
a
theory
of
mine
that
no
woman
can
know
a
man
until
she
exchanged
letters
with
him
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
say
a
winter
burns
went
on
pauline
made
some
sort
of
an
exclamation
but
he
failed
to
notice
it
neither
can
a
man
know
a
woman
it
a
stimulating
experience
suppose
we
try
it
how
often
do
you
propose
to
write
to
us
inquired
pauline
now
at
last
red
pepper
burns
looked
at
her
if
she
had
known
him
better
she
would
have
known
that
all
his
vows
to
keep
his
tongue
from
certain
words
were
at
that
moment
very
nearly
as
written
in
water
but
the
look
he
gave
her
stung
her
for
an
instant
into
silence
i
shall
want
to
hear
about
bob
ellen
replied
all
you
can
tell
me
i
have
promised
to
write
to
him
you
will
have
to
read
the
letters
aloud
to
him
which
will
give
you
a
very
fair
idea
of
what
i
am
doing
but
if
you
care
for
an
extra
sheet
for
yourself
now
and
then
an
extra
sheet
when
i
am
in
the
mood
i
am
likely
to
write
a
dozen
sheets
to
you
when
i
not
a
page
will
be
all
you
care
to
read
will
you
agree
to
the
most
erratic
correspondence
you
ever
had
with
the
most
erratic
fellow
it
sounds
very
promising
she
answered
smiling
the
train
drew
into
the
city
station
the
stop
was
a
short
one
for
the
limited
was
late
in
the
rush
of
outgoing
and
incoming
passengers
burns
managed
for
the
space
of
sixty
seconds
to
get
out
of
range
of
pauline
ears
i
shall
count
the
hours
till
i
get
that
first
letter
said
he
she
looked
up
you
surely
do
expect
a
letter
till
you
have
sent
one
he
laughed
i
going
home
to
begin
to
write
it
now
he
said
pauline
accompanied
him
to
the
vestibule
where
he
shook
hands
with
her
forgivingly
from
the
platform
he
secured
a
last
glimpse
of
the
other
face
which
gave
him
a
friendly
smile
as
he
saluted
with
his
dusty
leather
cap
held
out
toward
her
at
the
length
of
his
arm
when
he
could
no
longer
see
her
he
drew
a
gusty
sigh
and
turned
away
as
he
stood
at
the
street
entrance
of
the
big
station
waiting
for
johnny
caruthers
and
the
green
imp
this
is
what
he
was
saying
to
himself
red
you
made
more
than
one
woman
unhappy
to
say
nothing
of
yourself
by
making
love
to
her
because
she
was
a
beauty
and
your
head
swam
this
time
you
tried
rather
hard
to
do
her
the
justice
to
wait
till
you
know
only
time
and
absence
can
settle
that
remember
you
found
a
nest
of
gray
hairs
in
your
red
pate
this
morning
that
should
show
that
you
gaining
wisdom
at
last
the
salt
in
the
red
pepper
seasoning
of
time
eh
but
by
the
rate
of
my
pulse
at
this
present
moment
i
inclined
to
believe
it
going
to
be
a
bit
hard
to
write
an
absolutely
sane
letter
perhaps
it
would
be
safer
if
i
knew
pauline
pry
would
see
it
i
try
to
write
as
if
i
knew
she
would
but
by
the
spark
i
thought
i
saw
in
those
black
eyes
i
do
really
imagine
pauline
will
chapter
ix
in
which
he
suffers
a
defeat
the
hands
of
the
office
clock
were
pointing
to
half
after
two
on
a
certain
september
night
when
burns
came
into
his
office
alone
the
fire
in
the
office
fireplace
kept
bright
until
nearly
midnight
when
his
housekeeper
had
given
up
waiting
for
him
and
gone
to
bed
had
burned
to
a
few
smouldering
lumps
of
a
big
leather
its
arms
worn
with
much
use
had
been
pulled
into
an
inviting
position
before
the
fireplace
and
the
by
the
desk
was
burning
as
usual
all
that
could
be
expected
had
been
done
by
the
cynthia
who
comprehended
by
signs
she
knew
well
and
had
been
watching
for
several
days
that
affairs
were
going
wrong
with
her
employer
but
he
needed
more
than
could
be
given
him
by
things
inanimate
needed
it
woefully
he
came
in
as
a
man
comes
who
is
not
only
physically
weary
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
but
heart
sick
and
sore
besides
he
dropped
his
heavy
surgical
bags
upon
the
floor
by
the
desk
as
if
he
wanted
never
to
take
them
up
again
pulled
off
coat
and
cap
and
let
them
fall
where
they
would
then
stumbled
blindly
over
to
the
big
chair
and
sank
into
it
with
a
great
sigh
as
if
he
had
reached
the
end
of
all
endeavour
if
it
had
been
physical
fatigue
alone
which
had
brought
him
to
this
pass
he
might
have
dropped
asleep
where
he
sat
and
waked
after
an
hour
or
two
to
drag
himself
away
to
bed
like
one
who
had
been
drugged
for
a
short
space
indeed
he
lay
motionless
in
the
chair
in
the
attitude
of
one
so
spent
for
sleep
that
he
must
needs
find
it
in
the
first
place
his
body
touches
but
there
are
times
when
the
mind
will
not
let
the
body
rest
and
this
was
one
of
them
the
scene
he
had
left
lately
was
burning
before
his
tired
eyes
the
sounds
he
had
lately
heard
were
beating
in
his
brain
for
a
week
he
had
been
putting
every
power
he
possessed
into
the
attaining
of
an
end
for
which
it
had
more
than
once
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
be
willing
to
sacrifice
his
own
life
he
had
dared
everything
fought
every
one
had
his
own
way
in
spite
of
every
obstacle
believing
to
the
last
that
he
could
win
as
he
had
so
often
won
before
by
sheer
contempt
of
danger
but
this
time
he
had
failed
that
was
all
there
was
of
it
he
had
failed
failed
so
absolutely
so
humiliatingly
so
publicly
this
was
the
way
he
put
it
to
himself
that
he
was
in
disgrace
he
had
operated
when
others
advised
against
operation
and
had
seemed
to
succeed
brilliantly
and
incredibly
then
the
case
had
begun
to
go
wrong
he
had
operated
a
second
time
against
all
precedent
taking
tremendous
risks
and
had
lost
but
this
was
not
the
worst
he
had
lost
cases
before
and
had
suffered
keenly
over
them
but
not
as
he
was
suffering
now
in
a
world
of
death
some
cases
must
be
lost
even
by
the
most
successful
of
all
of
his
profession
but
this
was
an
unusual
case
this
was
o
god
how
could
he
bear
losing
this
one
he
had
known
her
from
a
little
girl
of
eight
till
now
when
at
sixteen
bright
beautiful
winsome
sixteen
he
had
what
had
he
done
she
might
have
had
a
chance
for
life
without
operation
he
had
taken
that
chance
away
and
she
had
trusted
him
how
she
had
trusted
him
ah
there
was
the
bitter
drop
in
the
cup
the
turn
of
the
knife
in
the
raw
wound
when
the
others
had
opposed
she
had
looked
up
at
him
with
that
smile
of
hers
how
could
she
smile
when
she
was
in
such
pain
and
whispered
please
do
whatever
you
want
to
doctor
and
he
had
answered
confidently
good
for
you
lucile
if
only
they
all
trust
me
like
that
i
show
them
what
i
could
do
vain
boast
wild
boast
he
had
been
a
fool
twice
a
fool
thrice
a
fool
he
was
a
fool
clear
through
that
was
the
matter
with
him
a
proud
fool
who
had
thought
that
with
a
thrust
of
his
tools
he
could
turn
death
himself
aside
and
when
he
had
tried
his
hand
a
second
time
in
the
last
futile
effort
to
avert
the
impending
disaster
she
had
trusted
him
just
the
same
when
he
had
said
to
her
speaking
close
to
her
dull
ear
dear
little
girl
i
going
to
ask
you
to
go
to
sleep
again
for
me
she
had
turned
her
head
upon
the
pillow
that
tortured
young
head
he
would
not
have
thought
she
could
move
it
at
all
and
had
smiled
at
him
again
for
the
last
time
he
would
remember
that
smile
while
he
lived
he
got
up
from
his
chair
as
the
intolerable
memory
smote
him
again
as
it
had
been
smiting
him
these
three
hours
since
the
end
had
come
he
began
to
pace
the
floor
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
there
were
those
who
said
that
burns
threw
off
his
cases
easily
did
not
worry
about
them
did
not
take
it
to
heart
when
they
went
wrong
it
is
a
thing
often
said
of
the
men
who
must
turn
from
one
patient
to
another
and
show
to
the
second
no
hint
of
how
the
first
may
be
faring
those
who
say
it
do
not
know
can
never
know
the
hours
wore
on
burns
could
not
sleep
could
not
even
relax
and
rest
to
the
first
agony
of
disappointment
succeeded
a
depression
so
profound
that
it
seemed
to
him
he
could
never
rise
above
it
and
take
up
his
work
again
a
hundred
times
he
went
painfully
over
the
details
of
the
case
from
first
to
last
why
had
he
done
as
he
had
why
had
he
not
listened
to
grayson
to
van
horn
to
fields
only
butler
had
backed
him
up
in
his
decisions
and
he
knew
well
enough
that
butler
had
done
it
only
because
of
his
faith
in
burns
himself
and
his
remembrance
of
some
of
his
extraordinary
successes
not
because
his
own
judgment
approved
five
six
he
had
thrown
himself
into
the
chair
again
and
had
at
last
dropped
into
an
uneasy
sort
of
half
slumber
when
the
office
door
quietly
opened
and
miss
mathewson
came
in
it
was
two
hours
before
she
was
due
burns
roused
and
regarded
her
wonderingly
with
eyes
heavy
and
she
stood
still
and
looked
down
at
him
sympathy
in
her
face
she
herself
was
pale
with
fatigue
and
loss
of
sleep
for
she
had
been
with
him
throughout
the
week
of
struggle
over
the
case
he
had
lost
and
she
knew
the
situation
as
no
one
else
even
his
professional
colleagues
knew
it
but
she
smiled
wanly
down
at
him
like
a
pitying
angel
you
did
go
to
bed
doctor
she
said
very
gently
i
was
afraid
you
would
wo
you
go
now
you
know
there
a
day
work
before
he
shook
his
head
no
i
rather
get
out
in
the
air
i
going
now
i
like
to
take
the
imp
and
drive
to
no
no
she
spoke
quickly
coming
closer
as
if
she
understood
and
would
not
let
him
use
the
reckless
common
phrase
which
sometimes
means
despair
i
thought
you
might
be
feeling
like
that
that
why
i
came
early
not
that
i
can
say
anything
to
cheer
you
doctor
burns
i
know
you
care
too
much
for
that
but
there
one
thing
you
must
realize
you
must
say
it
over
and
over
to
yourself
you
did
your
best
no
human
being
can
do
a
fool
best
he
muttered
cold
comfort
not
a
fool
best
a
skilful
surgeon
he
shook
his
head
again
got
slowly
up
from
his
chair
and
stood
staring
down
into
the
ashes
of
the
fire
the
usually
straight
shoulders
were
bent
the
naturally
head
always
carried
confidently
erect
was
sunk
upon
the
broad
chest
amy
mathewson
watched
him
for
a
minute
her
own
face
full
of
pain
then
laid
her
hand
rather
timidly
upon
his
arm
he
looked
round
at
her
and
tried
to
smile
but
the
effort
only
made
his
expression
the
more
pitiful
bless
your
heart
said
he
brokenly
i
believe
you
stand
by
me
to
the
last
ditch
of
a
her
eyes
suddenly
filled
i
let
you
operate
on
my
mother
said
she
in
a
low
voice
he
gazed
into
her
working
face
for
a
long
moment
seized
her
hand
and
wrung
it
hard
then
strode
away
into
the
inner
office
and
flung
the
door
shut
behind
him
a
later
he
came
out
he
had
himself
sternly
in
hand
again
his
shoulders
were
squared
his
head
up
in
his
face
was
written
a
peculiar
grim
defiance
which
those
who
did
not
comprehend
might
easily
mistake
for
the
stoicism
imputed
to
men
of
his
calling
under
defeat
miss
mathewson
knew
better
understood
that
it
was
taking
all
his
courage
to
face
his
work
again
and
realized
as
nobody
else
could
that
the
day
before
him
would
be
one
of
the
hardest
he
had
yet
had
to
live
but
she
was
hopeful
that
little
by
little
he
would
come
back
to
the
same
recognition
of
that
which
she
felt
was
really
true
that
in
spite
of
the
results
he
had
been
justified
in
the
risk
he
had
taken
and
that
he
could
not
be
blamed
that
conditions
which
only
a
superhuman
penetration
could
have
foreseen
would
arise
to
thwart
him
cynthia
has
your
breakfast
ready
for
you
doctor
miss
mathewson
said
quietly
as
he
came
out
she
did
not
look
up
from
the
desk
where
she
was
working
on
accounts
but
as
he
passed
her
on
his
way
to
the
he
laid
his
hand
for
an
instant
on
her
shoulder
and
when
she
looked
up
she
met
his
grateful
eyes
she
had
given
him
the
greatest
proof
of
confidence
in
her
power
and
it
had
been
the
one
ray
of
light
in
his
black
hour
wo
you
take
just
a
taste
o
the
chops
doctor
urged
his
housekeeper
anxiously
she
knew
nothing
of
the
situation
but
she
had
not
served
him
for
eight
years
not
to
have
learned
something
of
his
moods
and
it
was
clear
to
her
that
he
had
had
little
sleep
for
many
nights
but
he
put
aside
the
plate
i
know
they
fine
cynthia
said
he
in
his
gentlest
way
but
the
coffee
all
i
want
this
morning
another
cup
cynthia
hesitated
a
motherly
sort
of
solicitude
in
her
homely
face
doctor
do
you
know
you
had
four
and
it
awful
have
i
well
perhaps
that
enough
thank
you
his
housekeeper
looked
after
him
as
he
left
the
room
he
terrible
blue
to
be
so
polite
as
that
she
reflected
when
he
happy
he
in
such
a
hurry
he
do
have
time
to
thank
a
body
of
the
two
i
guess
rather
have
him
hustlin
rude
in
the
middle
of
the
day
burns
met
van
horn
sorry
the
case
went
wrong
doctor
said
his
colleague
there
was
a
peculiar
sparkle
in
his
eye
as
he
offered
this
customary
perfunctory
condolence
thank
you
replied
burns
shortly
i
did
wish
to
seem
skeptical
and
you
certainly
have
had
remarkable
success
in
somewhat
similar
cases
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
advising
as
i
did
i
was
holding
the
only
safe
ground
personally
i
not
in
favour
of
taking
chances
and
in
this
case
it
seemed
to
me
they
were
pretty
they
i
did
my
best
to
assure
the
family
that
you
were
within
your
much
i
do
blame
you
for
feeling
broken
up
about
it
declared
the
other
man
soothingly
but
we
all
have
to
learn
by
experience
and
conservatism
is
one
of
the
hardest
an
ugly
light
was
growing
in
red
pepper
eye
he
got
away
without
further
words
only
last
week
van
horn
had
been
helped
out
of
a
serious
and
baffling
complication
by
burns
himself
and
no
credit
given
to
the
rescuer
from
him
this
sort
of
high
and
mighty
sympathy
was
particularly
hard
to
bear
around
the
corner
he
encountered
grayson
this
as
it
was
so
little
to
be
desired
was
naturally
to
be
expected
too
bad
doctor
grayson
began
stopping
to
shake
hands
van
horn
had
not
even
shaken
hands
i
hoped
till
the
last
that
we
were
all
wrong
and
you
were
right
but
that
heart
seemed
dangerously
shaky
to
me
though
i
know
you
did
think
i
there
was
a
queer
factor
in
the
case
one
i
felt
from
the
first
though
i
could
put
my
finger
on
it
it
was
the
thing
that
made
me
advise
against
i
but
of
course
there
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
you
did
your
best
continued
grayson
cheerfully
pretty
little
girl
plucky
too
sorry
to
see
her
burns
nodded
and
bolted
these
job
comforters
were
they
trying
to
make
the
thing
seem
even
more
unbearable
than
it
already
was
certainly
they
were
succeeding
admirably
he
went
on
about
his
work
with
set
teeth
expecting
at
the
next
turn
to
run
into
fields
he
would
undoubtedly
find
him
at
the
hospital
ready
to
greet
him
with
some
croaking
sympathy
true
to
his
expectations
fields
met
him
at
the
door
he
himself
was
looking
particularly
prosperous
and
cheerful
as
people
have
a
way
of
appearing
to
us
when
our
trouble
is
root
theirs
good
morning
fields
shook
hands
evidently
trying
to
modify
his
own
demeanour
of
unusual
good
cheer
over
a
list
of
patients
all
safely
on
the
road
to
ultimate
recovery
i
want
to
express
my
regret
over
the
way
things
came
out
last
night
mighty
pretty
operation
if
it
had
succeeded
sorry
it
did
better
luck
next
much
burns
had
a
expression
now
not
the
most
discerning
observer
would
have
imagined
he
felt
a
twinge
of
regret
over
his
failure
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
made
you
so
confident
that
the
spleen
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
complication
fields
inquired
in
a
deprecatory
manner
which
made
burns
long
to
twist
his
neck
did
you
suggest
that
it
did
beforehand
i
believe
i
did
if
i
i
believe
you
did
nor
any
other
man
till
i
got
in
and
found
it
you
all
observed
it
then
and
so
did
i
excuse
me
i
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
stop
to
discuss
the
case
now
i
due
and
once
more
burns
made
good
his
escape
sore
was
field
verdict
looking
after
the
man
who
had
been
his
successful
rival
for
so
long
that
this
exception
could
hardly
fail
to
afford
a
decided
if
rather
satisfaction
to
a
brother
surgeon
not
above
that
quite
human
sentiment
but
in
the
course
of
the
day
burns
met
buller
he
had
dreaded
to
meet
him
but
not
for
the
same
reason
that
he
had
dreaded
the
others
meeting
buller
was
quite
another
story
old
boy
i
so
sorry
i
could
cry
if
it
would
do
you
any
good
said
buller
his
steady
honest
gaze
meeting
his
friend
miserable
eyes
for
the
defiance
had
melted
out
of
burns
aspect
and
left
it
frankly
wretched
before
the
hearty
friendship
in
this
man
whole
attitude
friendship
which
could
be
counted
upon
like
that
of
his
office
nurse
to
the
end
of
all
things
burns
swallowed
hard
making
no
reply
because
he
could
not
but
his
hand
returned
the
steady
pressure
of
butler
in
a
way
that
showed
he
was
grateful
i
knew
you
take
it
hard
much
harder
than
common
and
of
course
i
understand
why
any
man
would
but
i
wish
i
could
make
you
feel
the
way
i
do
about
it
there
not
one
particle
of
reason
for
you
to
blame
yourself
i
thought
the
case
over
and
over
from
start
to
finish
and
i
more
and
more
convinced
that
she
would
have
lived
without
the
operation
you
gave
her
her
only
chance
take
that
in
i
mean
it
i
went
around
there
this
morning
and
told
the
family
so
i
took
that
liberty
it
was
a
comfort
to
them
though
they
believed
anyway
they
have
lost
a
particle
of
faith
in
burns
bit
his
lip
till
he
had
it
under
control
and
could
get
out
a
word
or
two
of
gratitude
and
now
i
want
a
favour
of
you
the
other
went
on
hurriedly
a
case
i
want
you
to
see
with
me
possible
operation
within
a
day
or
burns
hesitated
an
instant
changing
colour
then
are
you
sure
better
have
me
he
asked
a
trifle
huskily
the
other
looked
him
in
the
eye
why
not
i
know
of
nobody
so
competent
come
man
put
that
satan
of
unreasonable
behind
you
when
man
becomes
omniscient
and
omnipotent
there
be
no
errors
in
his
judgment
or
his
performance
and
not
before
meanwhile
we
all
in
the
soup
of
fallibility
together
i
i
not
much
at
expressing
myself
elegantly
but
i
trust
i
sufficiently
forcible
smiled
buller
er
will
you
meet
me
at
four
at
my
office
we
go
to
the
together
and
i
give
you
the
history
of
the
case
on
the
way
it
a
corker
i
assure
you
and
it
keeping
me
awake
proceeding
on
his
way
alone
in
the
imp
he
had
not
wanted
even
johnny
caruthers
company
burns
found
the
heaviness
of
his
spirit
lifting
slightly
very
slightly
tenderness
toward
the
little
lost
patient
who
had
loved
and
trusted
him
so
well
began
gradually
to
usurp
the
place
of
the
black
hatred
of
what
he
felt
to
be
his
own
incompetency
passing
a
florist
shop
he
suddenly
felt
like
giving
that
which
as
it
had
occurred
to
him
before
had
seemed
to
him
would
be
only
a
mockery
from
his
hands
he
went
in
and
selected
flowers
dozens
and
dozens
of
white
rosebuds
fresh
and
sweet
and
sent
them
with
no
card
at
all
to
her
home
then
he
drove
on
to
his
next
patient
to
find
himself
surrounded
by
an
eager
group
of
happy
people
all
rejoicing
in
what
appeared
to
them
to
be
a
marvelous
deliverance
from
a
great
impending
danger
entirely
due
to
his
own
foresight
and
skill
he
knew
well
enough
that
it
way
nature
herself
who
had
come
to
the
rescue
and
frankly
told
them
so
but
they
continued
to
thrust
the
honour
upon
him
and
he
could
but
come
away
with
a
softened
heart
i
go
on
again
he
said
to
himself
i
got
to
go
on
last
night
i
thought
i
could
but
of
course
that
nonsense
the
best
i
can
god
knows
i
try
and
i
never
make
that
mistake
again
but

not

grant
a
rugged
sort
of
commonsense
chap
hates

and
fuss
he
gets
an
overpowering
lot
of
being
in
precisely
the
conventional
style
he
a
pretty
big
gun
now
and
he
ca
escape
when
i
told
him
i
was
going
to
have
him
out
for
a
plain
dinner
at

he
looked
as
relieved
as
if
i
offered
him
a
reprieve

some
undoubtedly
he
enjoy
the
relaxation
hut
you
have
a
caterer
out
from

your
life
cynthia
can
cook
well
enough
for
me
and
i
know
ronald
grant
tastes
like
a
book
but
what
i
want
to
ask
is
that
you
and
martha
macauley
will
come
over
and
see
that
the
table
looks
shipshape
cynthia
a
captain
of
the
kitchen
but
her
ideas
of
table
decoration
are
a
trifle
too
original
even
for
me
miss
mathewson
away
on
her
vacation
i
send
in
some
flowers
my
silver
and
china
are
nothing
remarkable
bur
as
long
as
the
food
right
that
i
shall
be
delighted
to
do
it
for
you
red
as
you
know
so
will
martha
we
thanks
immensely
i
want
ches
of
course
and
jim
macauley
coming
the
rest
are
m
i
must
be
he
would
have
been
off
without
doubt
in
an
instant
more
for
he
was
half
out
of
the
door
as
he
spoke
but
winifred
chester
flew
after
him
and
laid
an
insistent
hand
on
his
coat
sleeve
red
you
must
stop
long
enough
to
tell
me
something
about
it
how
can
i
help
you
unless
i
know
your
plans
what
hour
have
you
set
how
many
are
coming
and
who
how
many
courses
are
you
going
to
have
have
you
engaged
a
waitress
red
pepper
looked
bewildered
is
there
all
that
to
it
he
inquired
helplessly
how
in
thunder
i
beg
your
pardon
how
do
i
know
how
many
courses
there
be
ask
cynthia
that
the
hour
get
around
earlier
even
if
i
wanted
to
be
less
formal
there
van
horn
and
buller
and
fields
and
grayson
and
grant
and
ches
and
jim
and
and
myself
i
may
have
asked
somebody
else
seems
as
if
did
but
i
remember
you
better
put
on
an
extra
plate
in
case
i
he
was
starting
off
again
but
winifred
laughing
helplessly
again
detained
him
red
you
too
absurd
what
about
the
waitress
shall
i
find
one
for
you
i
supposed
cynthia
could
serve
us
she
always
does
she
ca
and
prepare
things
to
send
in
oh
well
see
to
it
if
you
be
so
kind
only
let
me
go
for
i
only
fifteen
minutes
now
to
meet
a
consultant
ten
miles
away
he
took
time
to
turn
and
smile
at
her
and
for
the
sake
of
the
smile
she
knew
of
none
other
just
like
it
she
forgave
him
for
involving
her
in
the
labours
she
already
clearly
foresaw
were
to
be
hers
how
precisely
like
red
pepper
burns
it
was
to
plan
for
a
stag
dinner
in
this
inconsequent
way
if
it
had
been
a
coming
operation
now
no
detail
of
preparation
would
have
been
too
insignificant
to
command
his
attention
but
in
the
present
instance
unquestionably
all
he
had
done
was
to
appear
at
the
door
of
the
kitchen
and
casually
inform
cynthia
that
eight
or
nine
men
were
coming
to
dinner
and
he
trust
her
to
see
that
they
should
have
something
good
to
eat
poor
cynthia
winifred
ran
over
to
consult
martha
macauley
and
together
they
braved
burns
housekeeper
in
her
kitchen
the
result
was
relief
as
far
as
the
dinner
itself
was
concerned
cynthia
was
a
superior
cook
and
long
experience
with
exclusively
masculine
tastes
had
taught
her
the
sort
of
thing
which
however
out
of
the
beaten
line
for
entertaining
was
likely
to
prove
successful
in
pleasing
eight
or
nine
men
wherever
they
might
hail
from
cynthia
planned
a
dinner
that
will
be
about
as
different
from
lazier
concoctions
as
could
be
imagined
winifred
said
to
martha
but
it
will
taste
what
ches
calls
good
now
for
the
table
i
afraid
red
china
and
linen
are
none
too
fine
we
have
to
help
him
out
they
helped
him
out
only
the
finest
of
martha
linen
and
silver
the
thinnest
of
winifred
plates
and
cups
and
the
most
precious
of
her
glass
would
content
them
when
the
table
was
set
in
the
old
where
red
pepper
was
accustomed
to
bolt
his
meals
alone
when
he
took
time
for
them
at
all
it
was
a
to
table
to
suggest
arrogantly
the
hand
of
woman
winifred
eyed
it
with
milled
satisfaction
and
concern
it
looks
lovely
martha
but
not
a
bit
do
you
suppose
he
mind
not
as
long
as
the
food
is
right
and
judging
by
the
heavenly
smells
from
the
kitchen
there
no
fear
for
that
but
it
five
and
the
flowers
he
promised
you
have
come
do
you
suppose
forgotten
of
course
he
has
if
he
remembers
the
dinner
itself
it
be
all
we
can
expect
of
him
it
does
matter
there
are
heaps
of
pink
and
crimson
asters
yet
in
the
garden
and
some
fall
anemones
we
arrange
them
and
then
if
his
flowers
do
come
we
change
but
they
they
did
but
the
pink
and
crimson
asters
furnished
a
centrepiece
decidedly
more
in
keeping
somehow
with
a
men
dinner
than
roses
would
have
been
and
the
decorators
were
content
with
them
dora
macauley
own
serving
maid
who
was
to
take
the
part
of
the
waitress
red
pepper
had
not
thought
necessary
said
they
looked
awful
tasty
it
after
seven
and
red
has
come
winifred
chester
rushed
at
arthur
dressing
placidly
jim
went
in
for
the
men
with
his
car
and
said
he
surely
have
them
here
by
you
have
to
go
over
and
do
the
honours
for
him
till
he
comes
he
have
to
dress
after
he
gets
he
wo
stop
to
dress
not
if
he
late
predicted
chester
obediently
hastening
he
rush
in
at
the
last
minute
smelling
horribly
of
antiseptics
and
set
everybody
laughing
with
some
story
they
wo
care
what
he
wears
it
always
a
case
of
macgregor
sits
there
the
head
of
the
table
you
know
with
red
i
certainly
hope
nothing
will
make
him
late
i
not
up
to
playing
host
to
a
lot
of
physicians
and
surgeons
i
should
feel
as
if
i
were
about
to
be
operated
nonsense
dear
there
no
jollier
company
when
they
off
duty
but
red
is
here
yet
and
i
sure
i
hear
jim
gabriel
down
the
road
do
hurry
chester
ran
across
the
back
lawn
and
in
through
burns
kitchen
startling
cynthia
so
that
she
nearly
dropped
the
into
a
sauce
she
was
making
for
the
beefsteak
he
reached
the
little
front
porch
just
in
time
to
welcome
the
batch
of
professional
gentlemen
who
came
talking
and
laughing
up
the
path
together
doctor
burns
has
been
detained
but
i
sure
he
be
here
soon
chester
explained
shaking
hands
and
discovering
for
himself
which
was
the
famous
scottish
surgeon
by
the
rugged
commonsense
look
of
the
man
quite
as
burns
had
characterized
him
no
red
pepper
eight
still
no
sign
of
him
harder
to
be
explained
no
sign
from
him
why
did
he
telephone
or
send
a
telegram
or
a
messenger
waiting
longer
would
not
do
cynthia
in
the
kitchen
was
becoming
unnervingly
agitated
the
dinner
was
served
chester
at
one
end
of
the
table
macauley
at
the
other
both
feeling
a
terrible
responsibility
upon
them
did
their
best
there
had
turned
out
to
be
two
extra
guests
instead
of
the
one
whom
burns
had
thought
he
might
have
asked
but
could
be
sure
and
winifred
had
had
a
bad
ten
minutes
looking
out
a
full
set
of
everything
with
which
to
set
his
place
for
red
pepper
place
must
certainly
be
left
unfilled
it
would
be
beyond
the
possibilities
that
the
dinner
should
end
without
him
i
believe
he
has
forgotten
whispered
martha
to
winifred
in
the
office
from
whose
dim
shadows
they
were
surreptitiously
peering
into
the
dining
room
to
make
sure
that
everything
was
going
properly
oh
he
could
not
with
the
edinburgh
man
here
he
often
told
us
about
doctor
grant
and
how
much
he
owes
him
he
does
look
splendid
and
capable
does
he
for
all
he
so
burly
and
homely
and
the
other
men
all
feel
honoured
to
be
here
with
him
even
doctor
van
horn
always
so
impressed
with
they
seem
to
be
having
a
good
time
and
they
eating
as
if
they
never
saw
food
before
it
a
success
as
much
as
it
can
be
without
the
host
himself
oh
why
does
red
come
he
would
desert
a
patient
in
a
crisis
for
a
dozen
no
but
he
send
look
at
arthur
he
hobnobbing
with
doctor
grant
as
if
he
always
known
jim
is
having
a
bad
time
with
doctor
van
horn
i
can
see
it
in
his
eye
mercy
one
of
them
looked
this
way
i
afraid
he
saw
me
come
the
next
time
they
reconnoitred
the
dinner
was
working
toward
its
end
it
was
time
for
it
was
nearly
ten
and
cynthia
courses
though
not
many
had
been
mighty
presently
the
table
had
been
cleared
and
the
men
were
drinking
coffee
and
lighting
the
excellent
cigars
which
had
been
macauley
thought
when
he
found
that
red
pepper
was
not
on
hand
to
provide
them
himself
under
the
influence
of
these
genial
stimulants
burns
never
offered
any
others
and
one
man
who
knew
it
had
declined
to
come
the
sociability
grew
more
positive
chester
relaxed
his
legs
under
the
table
feeling
that
at
last
red
guests
could
take
care
of
themselves
grayson
proved
an
accomplished
buller
had
lately
had
some
remarkable
adventures
even
ronald
grant
who
had
seemed
a
trifle
taciturn
related
an
extraordinary
experience
of
another
man
the
scottish
surgeon
had
the
reputation
of
never
talking
about
himself
the
smoke
grew
thick
macauley
cigars
were
of
a
strong
brand
the
air
was
blue
with
their
reek
still
the
guests
sat
about
the
table
and
still
the
talk
went
on
it
was
interrupted
quite
suddenly
by
the
advent
of
red
pepper
burns
himself
macauley
saw
him
first
standing
in
the
doorway
between
dining
room
and
office
but
for
an
instant
he
did
not
know
him
startled
look
caught
chester
attention
he
sprang
to
his
feet
at
the
same
moment
the
scottish
surgeon
following
chester
eyes
observed
the
figure
in
the
door
he
was
first
to
reach
it
what
happened
ye
lad
he
asked
and
acted
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
threw
a
powerful
arm
about
burns
shoulders
and
led
him
reeling
back
into
the
office
where
the
air
was
purer
they
crowded
round
doctors
though
they
were
and
had
many
times
sharply
ordered
other
people
not
to
crowd
they
could
see
at
a
glance
that
burns
was
very
faint
that
his
right
arm
hung
helpless
at
his
side
that
his
forehead
wore
a
blackening
bruise
and
that
his
clothes
were
torn
and
covered
with
dirt
for
the
rest
they
had
to
wait
grant
took
charge
of
his
friend
the
pupil
whom
he
had
never
forgotten
the
arm
was
badly
broken
too
badly
to
be
set
without
an
anaesthetic
in
the
inner
office
van
horn
his
dress
coat
off
gave
the
chloroform
while
the
scotchman
set
the
arm
and
the
american
surgeons
no
longer
crowding
but
standing
off
respectfully
as
if
at
a
clinic
looked
on
critically
it
was
rapid
and
deft
work
they
admitted
especially
since
the
surgeon
was
using
another
man
splints
and
the
patient
proved
to
be
one
of
the
subjects
who
fight
the
anesthetic
from
beginning
to
end
chester
but
plucky
stuck
it
out
but
macauley
fled
to
the
outer
air
seeing
a
familiar
long
dark
form
half
on
half
off
the
driveway
he
hurried
toward
it
a
minute
later
he
had
all
the
unoccupied
guests
around
him
on
the
lawn
and
one
of
the
green
imp
lamps
was
turned
upon
its
crippled
shape
by
george
he
had
a
bad
accident
one
and
another
of
them
said
as
they
examined
the
car
injuries
the
hood
was
jammed
until
they
wondered
why
the
engine
was
not
disabled
the
left
was
nearly
torn
off
and
the
fender
a
shapeless
wreck
the
green
paint
was
scraped
and
splintered
along
the
left
side
he
must
have
come
home
by
himself
how
far
do
you
suppose
not
far
driving
with
his
left
hand
and
he
probably
was
faint
till
he
struck
the
indoor
heat
and
the
tobacco
he
come
at
least
five
miles
look
at
that
red
clay
on
her
sides
there
no
red
clay
like
that
around
here
except
in
one
place
at
the
old
mill
on
the
red
bank
chester
demonstrated
his
theory
excitedly
i
ought
to
know
i
ridden
with
him
on
every
in
the
county
first
any
last
there
a
fright
of
a
hill
just
five
miles
with
that
arm
gee
this
was
buller
plucky
was
grayson
comment
and
there
was
a
general
agreement
among
the
men
standing
round
macauley
put
his
shoulder
to
the
imp
let
push
her
in
fellows
he
proposed
he
had
forgotten
that
they
were
medical
gentlemen
of
position
i
do
seem
to
want
to
drive
her
just
now
he
explained
they
pushed
the
imp
to
the
red
barn
and
shut
it
in
with
its
injuries
then
they
went
back
to
the
house
where
presently
burns
came
out
from
under
his
anaesthetic
and
lay
looking
at
his
guests
from
under
the
bandage
which
swathed
his
head
i
mighty
sorry
to
have
broken
up
the
fun
this
way
gentlemen
he
said
with
a
pale
sort
of
smile
grayson
was
telling
a
story
when
i
butted
in
i
think
finish
it
will
you
grayson
not
much
yours
is
the
story
we
want
now
if
you
up
to
telling
it
what
happened
out
there
on
the
red
bank
road
burns
scanned
him
how
do
you
know
what
road
your
friend
chester
detective
instincts
he
says
there
no
other
red
clay
like
that
that
plasters
your
car
by
the
way
that
a
fast
machine
of
yours
did
you
lose
control
on
the
hill
that
it
acknowledged
burns
simply
i
lost
chester
was
staring
at
him
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
reason
to
suppose
that
red
pepper
had
lost
control
of
that
car
unless
something
else
had
happened
first
the
steering
gear
of
the
imp
was
certainly
in
perfect
condition
macauley
had
said
so
he
wondered
if
red
meant
that
he
had
lost
his
temper
but
what
could
make
him
lose
his
temper
on
red
bank
hill
they
questioned
him
closely
all
of
them
in
turn
but
that
was
all
he
would
say
he
had
lost
control
of
the
car
one
or
two
of
the
men
who
knew
burns
least
looked
as
if
they
could
tell
what
was
the
probable
cause
of
such
loss
of
control
chester
wanted
to
knock
them
down
as
he
fancied
he
recognized
this
attitude
of
mind
and
at
last
they
went
away
which
was
certainly
the
best
thing
they
could
do
in
the
circumstances
all
but
ronald
grant
the
scottish
surgeon
accepted
without
hesitation
burns
suggestion
that
doctor
grant
should
stay
and
keep
him
company
for
an
hour
or
two
while
he
got
used
to
his
arm
and
should
then
sleep
under
his
roof
so
they
settled
down
burns
on
his
couch
grant
in
an
armchair
when
chester
left
he
was
thinking
that
except
for
the
outward
signs
of
his
adventure
burns
did
not
look
as
unfit
as
might
have
been
expected
for
a
happy
hour
with
an
old
friend
just
outside
the
house
chester
himself
had
an
adventure
he
was
quite
alone
and
he
almost
ran
into
a
slim
figure
on
the
walk
the
lights
from
the
office
shone
out
into
the
october
night
and
chester
could
see
at
a
glance
who
the
girl
was
even
if
the
gleam
of
golden
hair
which
all
the
town
knew
had
not
told
him
she
was
panting
and
her
hand
was
on
her
side
did
doctor
burns
get
home
all
right
she
cried
under
her
breath
what
do
you
know
about
doctor
burns
was
chester
quick
reply
he
was
startled
by
the
girl
appearance
here
at
this
hour
it
does
make
any
difference
what
i
know
tell
me
if
he
got
home
was
he
much
hurt
why
should
you
tell
me
that
chester
he
is
home
and
all
right
do
you
want
him
professionally
he
ca
go
out
i
know
he
ca
but
i
had
to
know
he
got
home
i
she
sank
down
on
the
doorstep
shaken
and
sobbing
chester
stood
looking
down
at
het
wondering
what
on
earth
he
was
to
say
what
had
rose
seeley
to
do
with
red
what
had
she
to
do
with
his
losing
control
on
the
red
bank
hill
a
quick
thought
crossed
his
mind
to
be
as
quickly
dismissed
no
whatever
red
private
affairs
were
they
could
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
rose
too
bruised
and
trampled
a
rose
to
take
the
fancy
of
a
man
like
him
even
in
his
most
evil
hour
suddenly
she
lifted
her
head
he
saved
my
life
and
lost
his
they
been
making
repairs
on
the
hill
and
some
way
the
lanterns
was
lit
it
an
awful
dark
night
he
saw
what
he
was
comin
to
and
turned
out
sudden
into
the
grass
he
had
to
go
into
the
ditch
then
not
to
run
over
me
and
somebody
else
he
ran
away
plainly
that
scornful
accent
did
not
mean
burns
i
did
i
helped
him
get
the
car
up
i
got
his
engine
goin
for
him
he
showed
me
how
his
arm
was
broke
there
ai
no
house
for
a
mile
out
there
i
hated
to
see
him
try
to
come
home
alone
i
walked
all
the
way
run
some
of
it
to
make
sure
he
got
he
got
here
murmured
chester
thinking
to
himself
that
this
was
the
queerest
story
he
over
heard
but
confident
he
would
never
have
any
better
version
of
it
and
pretty
sure
that
it
was
the
true
one
i
suppose
i
a
crazy
fool
to
tell
you
chester
said
the
girl
thickly
but
you
a
gentleman
you
wo
tell
no
more
will
he
he
did
tell
you
how
it
happened
did
he
she
did
not
ask
the
question
she
made
the
assertion
looking
to
him
for
confirmation
chester
gave
it
no
he
did
tell
he
said
gravely
when
she
had
gone
he
crossed
the
lawn
to
his
own
home
musing
for
a
quiet
dinner
said
he
quoting
a
phrase
of
burns
used
when
he
gave
chester
the
invitation
i
think
red
has
been
about
as
spectacular
as
they
make
bully
old
chapter
xi
in
which
he
gets
even
with
himself
burns
sat
at
his
desk
in
the
inner
office
laboriously
inscribing
a
letter
with
his
left
hand
it
did
not
get
on
well
the
handwriting
in
the
four
lines
he
had
succeeded
in
fixing
upon
paper
bore
not
the
slightest
resemblance
to
his
usual
style
instead
it
looked
like
the
chirography
of
a
attempting
for
the
first
time
to
copy
from
some
older
person
script
he
held
up
the
sheet
and
gazed
at
it
in
disgust
then
he
glanced
resentfully
at
his
right
arm
especially
at
the
fingers
which
protruded
from
the
bandages
in
unaccustomed
limp
whiteness
then
he
shook
his
left
fist
at
it
you
do
some
work
the
minute
you
come
out
of
those
splints
he
said
you
work
your
passage
back
to
fitness
quicker
than
an
arm
ever
did
before
you
shirk
then
he
applied
himself
to
his
task
painfully
forming
a
series
of
pothooks
until
one
more
sentence
was
completed
he
read
it
over
then
suddenly
crumpled
the
sheet
into
a
ball
and
dropped
it
into
the
waste
basket
lie
there
he
whimsically
commanded
it
you
not
fit
to
go
to
a
he
got
up
and
marched
into
the
outer
office
where
his
office
nurse
sat
at
a
typewriter
making
lout
bills
miss
mathewson
he
requested
gruffly
please
take
a
dictation
no
not
on
the
bill
letterheads
on
the
regular
office
sheets
i
speak
slowly
in
fact
i
probably
speak
very
i
sorry
i
do
know
shorthand
said
miss
mathewson
preparing
her
paper
i
not
instead
i
rather
you
be
as
slow
as
you
can
to
give
me
time
to
think
i
not
used
to
transmitting
mediums
the
battery
may
be
weak
in
fact
i
pretty
sure
it
is
all
ready
my
dear
lessing
his
cheek
reddened
suddenly
as
he
saw
the
nurse
waiting
hands
poised
over
the
keys
when
she
had
written
this
address
he
cleared
his
throat
and
plunged
in
this
has
been
a
typical
november
day
dull
and
cold
we
had
fine
october
weather
clear
into
the
second
week
of
this
month
but
all
at
once
it
turned
cold
and
dull
the
leaves
are
all
off
the
trees
hold
on
do
say
that
she
knows
the
leaves
are
all
off
the
trees
the
middle
of
i
have
it
partly
oh
well
go
on
then
i
fix
it
a
fact
it
may
be
necessary
to
remind
you
of
down
there
in
south
carolina
where
miss
mathewson
do
you
suppose
the
leaves
are
on
in
south
carolina
i
really
do
know
doctor
burns
i
have
always
lived
in
the
so
have
i
bother
it
well
leave
that
but
i
written
fact
it
may
be
necessary
well
finish
it
a
fact
at
may
be
necessary
to
remind
you
of
you
have
been
gone
so
long
oh
hang
it
that
sounds
flat
how
can
i
tell
how
a
sentence
is
coming
out
this
way
let
that
paragraph
stand
by
itself
we
hasten
on
to
something
that
will
take
the
reader
mind
off
our
unfortunate
beginning
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
bobby
burns
is
well
and
not
only
well
but
fat
and
hearty
he
had
a
wrestling
bout
with
harold
macauley
the
other
day
and
downed
him
he
got
a
black
eye
but
that
did
count
though
you
may
not
like
to
hear
of
it
he
is
heavier
than
when
you
saw
him
oh
i
said
that
miss
mathewson
when
you
see
i
repeating
myself
hold
me
i
ca
always
tell
when
you
going
to
repeat
yourself
miss
mathewson
objected
that
enough
about
bob
anyhow
macauley
writes
her
all
about
him
every
week
only
she
probably
did
mention
the
black
eye
well
start
a
new
paragraph
when
in
doubt
always
start
a
new
paragraph
it
may
turn
out
a
gold
mine
i
found
my
work
much
crippled
by
the
loss
of
my
arm
good
heavens
that
sounds
as
if
i
had
it
amputated
and
i
suppose
she
naturally
would
infer
that
a
man
ca
do
as
much
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
as
he
can
when
it
in
commission
well
let
it
stand
i
did
realize
how
much
surgery
i
was
doing
till
i
had
to
cut
it
all
out
it
out
that
certainly
has
a
surgical
ring
it
sounds
rather
bragging
too
afraid
never
mind
the
worst
of
it
is
to
feel
the
muscles
atrophying
from
disuse
and
the
tissues
wasting
so
that
when
it
comes
out
of
the
splints
it
will
still
have
to
be
cured
of
the
degeneration
the
splints
have
oh
hold
on
miss
mathewson
this
sounds
like
a
paper
for
a
surgical
journal
burns
who
had
been
walking
up
and
down
the
room
cast
himself
into
an
armchair
and
stared
despairingly
at
his
amanuensis
but
she
reassured
him
by
saying
quietly
that
it
was
always
difficult
to
dictate
when
one
was
not
used
to
it
and
that
the
letter
sounded
quite
right
well
if
you
think
so
we
try
another
paragraph
that
certainly
enough
about
me
let
me
see
he
ran
his
left
hand
through
his
hair
footsteps
sounded
upon
the
porch
arthur
chester
opened
the
door
oh
excuse
me
red
it
nothing
i
was
going
for
a
tramp
and
i
thought
i
with
burns
sprang
to
his
feet
looking
immensely
relieved
thank
you
miss
mathewson
we
finish
another
time
or
perhaps
i
can
scrawl
a
finish
with
my
left
hand
i
take
the
letter
i
look
in
at
bob
and
get
my
hat
in
a
jiffy
he
seized
the
letter
ran
into
the
inner
office
looked
in
at
the
room
where
the
boy
was
sleeping
took
up
a
soft
hat
and
out
of
sight
of
miss
mathewson
crammed
the
typewritten
sheet
into
his
pocket
in
a
crumpled
condition
pulling
the
soft
hat
well
down
over
his
eyes
he
followed
chester
out
into
the
fresh
november
night
drawing
a
long
breath
of
satisfaction
as
the
chill
wind
struck
him
you
were
just
in
time
to
save
me
from
an
awful
scrape
i
got
myself
into
he
remarked
as
they
tramped
away
i
thought
you
looked
hot
and
unhappy
were
you
proposing
to
miss
mathewson
by
letter
it
always
best
to
say
those
things
right
out
letters
are
liable
to
misinterpretation
jeered
chester
you
right
there
i
was
riding
for
a
fall
fast
enough
when
you
reined
up
alongside
but
what
a
fellow
to
do
when
he
ca
write
himself
except
in
flytracks
i
presume
the
lady
would
prefer
the
to
a
typewritten
document
executed
by
another
how
do
you
know
the
thing
was
to
a
lady
burns
demanded
that
easy
no
man
looks
as
upset
as
you
did
over
a
communication
to
another
man
what
do
you
write
to
her
for
anyhow
when
she
as
near
as
washington
what
does
she
keep
you
informed
winifred
says
martha
says
ellen
came
back
up
to
washington
yesterday
for
the
wedding
of
a
friend
hastily
arranged
to
an
army
officer
suddenly
ordered
somewhere
old
friend
of
ellen
former
bridesmaid
of
hers
i
believe
she
burns
had
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
hubbly
street
they
were
crossing
how
long
does
she
stay
in
washington
i
do
know
ask
win
probably
not
long
since
she
only
came
for
this
wedding
it
tonight
i
think
she
said
are
you
coming
burns
walked
on
at
a
rapid
stride
with
which
chester
and
found
it
difficult
to
keep
up
they
had
their
tramp
a
course
which
they
were
accustomed
to
cover
frequently
together
at
varying
paces
chester
thought
they
had
never
covered
it
quite
so
quickly
nor
so
silently
before
for
burns
from
the
moment
of
receiving
chester
news
appeared
to
fall
into
a
reverie
from
which
it
was
impossible
to
draw
him
and
the
subject
of
which
his
companion
found
it
not
difficult
to
guess
after
the
first
half
mile
chester
than
whom
few
men
were
more
adaptable
to
a
friend
mood
accepted
the
situation
and
paced
along
as
silently
as
burns
until
the
round
was
made
and
the
two
were
at
burns
door
good
night
afraid
i
been
dumb
as
an
oyster
was
burns
curt
farewell
and
chester
chuckled
as
he
walked
away
something
come
of
the
dumbness
he
prophesied
to
himself
something
did
it
was
a
telegram
telephoned
to
the
office
by
a
sender
who
rejoiced
that
having
one
left
arm
in
a
sling
did
not
obstruct
one
capacity
to
send
pregnant
messages
by
wire
he
had
obtained
the
address
from
martha
macauley
also
over
the
telephone
mrs
lessing
washington
am
leaving
washington
hope
to
have
drive
with
you
morning
in
place
of
letters
impossible
to
write
i
suppose
that
a
fool
telegram
he
admitted
to
himself
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
but
after
that
typing
mess
i
had
to
express
myself
somehow
except
by
signs
now
to
get
off
luckily
this
suit
do
no
time
to
change
he
telephoned
for
a
sleeper
berth
he
called
up
a
village
physician
and
the
house
surgeon
at
the
city
hospital
and
made
arrangements
with
each
for
seeing
his
patients
during
the
two
nights
and
a
day
of
his
absence
he
had
no
serious
case
on
hand
and
of
course
no
surgical
work
so
that
it
was
easier
to
get
away
than
it
might
be
again
for
a
year
after
his
arm
should
be
once
more
to
be
counted
on
then
he
interviewed
cynthia
on
the
subject
of
bob
after
which
he
packed
a
small
bag
speculating
with
some
amusement
as
he
did
so
on
the
succession
of
porters
waiters
and
hotel
valets
he
should
have
to
fee
during
the
next
hours
to
secure
their
necessary
assistance
from
the
fastening
of
his
shoes
to
the
tying
of
his
scarfs
the
cutting
up
of
his
food
and
the
rest
of
the
hundred
little
services
which
must
be
rendered
the
man
with
his
right
arm
in
a
sling
i
may
not
look
a
subject
for
travel
miss
mathewson
he
announced
with
a
brilliant
smile
appearing
once
more
in
the
outer
office
where
the
was
just
coming
to
a
finish
but
i
off
nevertheless
thank
you
for
your
struggle
with
my
schoolboy
composition
we
wo
need
to
finish
it
i
oh
thunder
it
was
the
office
bell
miss
mathewson
answered
it
burns
prepared
to
deny
himself
to
all
ordinary
petitioners
saw
the
man
face
and
stopped
to
listen
it
was
a
fellow
who
told
him
his
brief
story
but
the
hearer
listened
with
attention
and
his
face
became
grave
he
turned
to
miss
mathewson
call
johnny
caruthers
and
the
imp
please
he
directed
telephone
the
pullman
ticket
office
and
change
my
berth
reservation
from
the
to
the
one
he
went
out
with
the
man
and
miss
mathewson
heard
him
say
you
walked
in
joe
you
can
ride
back
with
us
on
the
ten
minutes
after
he
had
gone
chester
came
again
he
found
miss
mathewson
reading
by
the
office
droplight
on
the
desk
stood
a
travelling
bag
beside
it
lay
a
light
overcoat
not
the
sort
that
red
pepper
was
accustomed
to
wear
in
the
car
a
dress
overcoat
with
a
silk
lining
on
it
reposed
a
that
and
a
pair
of
gloves
rolled
into
a
ball
man
fashion
chester
regarded
with
interest
these
unmistakable
signs
of
intended
travel
doctor
burns
going
out
of
town
he
inquired
casually
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
had
scented
action
of
some
sort
on
the
wind
which
had
taken
his
friend
from
his
company
at
the
conclusion
of
the
walk
ordinarily
burns
would
have
gone
into
chester
den
and
settled
down
for
an
hour
of
talk
before
bedtime
i
believe
so
miss
mathewson
replied
in
the
noncommittal
manner
of
the
professional
man
confidential
assistant
but
he
has
gone
out
for
a
call
back
soon
i
do
know
did
he
go
in
the
imp
country
call
probably
they
the
ones
that
bother
a
man
at
night
as
long
as
he
does
country
work
i
often
told
doctor
burns
it
was
time
he
gave
up
this
rural
practice
well
do
you
know
what
time
his
train
goes
after
midnight
some
miss
mathewson
knew
that
chester
was
doctor
burns
close
friend
but
she
was
too
accustomed
to
keep
her
lips
closed
over
her
employers
affairs
to
give
information
even
to
chester
except
under
protest
hm
well
i
believe
i
sit
up
for
him
and
help
him
off
a
man
needs
an
attendant
do
stay
up
miss
mathewson
i
take
any
message
he
may
leave
for
i
afraid
i
ought
to
wait
replied
the
faithful
nurse
doubtfully
i
do
believe
it
go
home
and
go
to
bed
like
a
tired
girl
as
you
no
doubt
are
and
trust
me
if
he
wants
you
i
promise
to
telephone
you
i
see
him
off
and
like
to
do
it
come
there
being
no
real
reason
for
doing
otherwise
than
follow
this
most
sensible
advice
miss
mathewson
went
away
chester
settling
himself
by
the
in
the
chair
she
had
vacated
fancied
she
looked
a
trifle
disappointed
and
wondered
why
surely
he
reasoned
the
girl
must
get
enough
of
erratic
night
work
without
sitting
up
merely
to
hand
burns
his
overcoat
and
wish
him
a
pleasant
journey
it
was
a
long
wait
chester
enlivened
it
by
telephoning
winifred
that
he
would
be
home
till
morning
or
sooner
and
elicited
a
flurry
of
questioning
which
he
evaded
rather
clumsily
it
was
all
right
for
him
to
be
curious
concerning
red
affairs
he
considered
but
there
was
no
need
for
the
women
to
get
started
on
inquisitive
questions
he
read
himself
asleep
at
last
over
the
office
magazines
and
was
awakened
by
a
hurried
step
on
the
porch
and
a
gust
of
november
night
air
on
his
warm
face
what
are
you
doing
here
was
the
question
which
assaulted
him
sitting
up
for
you
was
chester
sleepy
reply
he
rubbed
his
eyes
thought
you
might
like
to
have
me
see
you
off
i
not
going
anywhere
except
back
to
the
case
i
just
left
go
home
and
go
to
chester
sat
up
he
looked
at
burns
with
awakening
interest
he
had
never
seen
his
friend
face
look
grimmer
than
it
did
now
under
the
gray
slouch
hat
which
he
had
worn
for
the
tramp
pulled
well
down
over
his
brows
and
which
during
all
his
preparations
and
his
hasty
departure
in
the
car
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
remove
or
to
exchange
for
the
leather
cap
he
usually
wore
on
such
trips
back
to
a
country
case
instead
of
to
washington
incredulity
was
written
large
on
chester
face
burns
nodded
growing
grimmer
than
before
if
that
were
possible
he
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
glancing
over
at
the
desk
where
his
belongings
lay
how
did
you
know
i
was
going
to
washington
inferred
you
mighty
quick
at
inference
maybe
i
was
but
i
was
now
not
that
all
there
is
to
but
why
not
ca
you
turn
the
case
over
i
bet
my
hat
it
a
case
at
that
burns
nodded
again
it
you
an
ass
you
do
expect
her
to
stay
in
washington
waiting
for
you
do
you
when
she
only
came
up
for
that
wedding
and
is
going
straight
back
to
keep
some
other
engagements
that
what
win
says
she
to
no
i
do
expect
her
to
burns
pulled
the
slouch
hat
lower
yet
chester
could
barely
see
his
eyes
he
could
only
hear
the
tone
of
his
denial
of
any
such
absurd
expectation
chester
rose
and
stood
looking
down
at
his
friend
who
had
folded
his
left
arm
over
his
right
in
its
sling
as
he
sat
on
the
chair
arm
and
looked
the
picture
of
dogged
resignation
i
suppose
there
some
reason
at
the
bottom
of
what
strikes
me
as
pure
foolishness
he
admitted
you
wo
do
me
the
honour
of
mentioning
it
case
of
infected
wound
in
the
foot
threatened
tetanus
nobody
competent
to
treat
the
case
but
you
burns
looked
up
chester
saw
his
eyes
now
gloomy
but
resolute
no
it
up
to
me
alone
i
owe
it
to
the
woman
it
the
only
child
she
has
left
a
girl
it
was
her
boy
i
sent
to
a
better
world
with
maledictions
on
his
mother
comprehension
dawned
at
last
on
chester
face
he
saw
that
taking
into
consideration
burns
feeling
in
that
matter
there
was
really
nothing
to
be
said
i
hope
you
win
out
he
evolved
at
length
from
the
confusion
of
ideas
in
his
mind
i
hope
i
burns
rose
i
must
send
a
telegram
he
said
and
went
to
the
telephone
in
the
inner
office
while
he
was
there
chester
heard
the
honk
of
the
imp
horn
outside
when
burns
came
back
he
opened
the
outer
door
and
called
to
johnny
caruthers
to
know
if
he
had
obtained
the
serum
for
which
he
had
been
sent
to
the
druggist
johnny
shouted
back
that
he
had
burns
turned
to
chester
good
night
he
said
much
obliged
for
waiting
up
for
then
with
a
certain
fighting
expression
on
his
lips
which
chester
had
learned
to
know
meant
that
his
whole
purpose
was
set
on
the
attainment
of
an
end
for
which
no
price
could
be
too
great
to
pay
burns
went
out
to
johnny
caruthers
and
the
green
imp
chapter
xii
in
which
he
has
his
own
way
doc
joe
tressler
followed
burns
down
the
path
leaving
his
wife
standing
in
the
doorway
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
retreating
figure
of
the
man
who
had
saved
to
her
her
one
remaining
child
doc
we
ai
to
forget
this
neither
am
i
joe
for
various
reasons
replied
burns
watching
johnny
caruthers
try
the
green
imp
spark
he
jumped
in
beside
johnny
and
looked
back
at
joe
remember
now
keep
things
going
just
as
i
leave
them
and
i
shall
expect
to
find
letty
nearly
as
well
as
ever
when
i
see
her
again
i
shall
be
back
in
five
days
i
be
around
when
you
get
back
with
some
burns
looked
the
man
in
the
eye
oh

joe

say
anything

do
i
mean
it
this
time
doe
i
sure

and
the
old
woman

the
fellow
choked
all
right
joe
i
as
glad
as

letty
safe
take
care
of
her
take
care
of
your
wife
do
a
stroke
of
good
work
once
in
a
while
it
help
that
tired
feeling
of
yours
that
getting
to
be
dangerously
chronic
you
no
idea
joe
what
a
satisfaction
it
is
now
and
then
to
feel
that
you
accomplished
something
try
it
he
waved
his
hand
at
the
woman
in
the
door
who
responded
with
a
flutter
of
her
dingy
apron
which
was
immediately
thereafter
applied
to
her
eyes
within
by
the
window
a
little
girl
hugged
a
remarkable
doll
with
yellow
hair
and
a
red
silk
frock
you
ought
to
be
pretty
proud
letty
tressler
said
the
woman
returning
to
the
small
convalescent
to
think
doc
kissed
you
when
he
left
he
been
awful
good
to
you
doc
has
and
him
with
that
arm
in
a
sling
him
all
the
time
but
i
did
think
he
do
maybe
it
i
so
clean
now
speculated
the
child
weakly
when
he
did
it
he
whispered
in
my
ear
that
he
liked
clean
letty
you
ai
goin
to
have
any
kind
o
face
but
a
clean
face
after
this
jest
on
account
o
doc
burns
vowed
her
mother
emotionally
and
the
child
her
doll
pressed
against
her
face
nodded
far
down
the
road
burns
was
bidding
johnny
caruthers
put
on
more
speed
we
have
to
make
time
johnny
he
explained
i
going
to
get
off
on
that
if
i
have
to
break
my
other
arm
to
do
it
i
do
know
that
i
be
much
more
helpless
than
i
am
now
if
i
did
curious
johnny
how
many
things
there
are
a
man
ca
do
with
one
i
should
say
you
could
do
more
with
that
left
hand
of
yours
than
most
folks
can
with
both
declared
young
caruthers
honest
admiration
in
his
eye
burns
laughed
a
hearty
laugh
he
was
in
wild
spirits
johnny
could
see
that
and
wondered
why
the
doctor
should
be
so
happy
over
pulling
a
family
out
of
their
troubles
everybody
knew
joe
tressler
and
johnny
understood
that
the
doctor
had
given
up
going
away
on
joe
account
ten
days
ago
when
he
took
the
case
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
johnny
had
seen
his
employer
in
all
stages
of
tension
since
that
day
as
he
had
driven
him
out
at
first
times
in
the
hours
to
this
same
little
old
wreck
of
a
house
johnny
had
driven
him
to
other
houses
also
to
one
especially
in
the
city
where
the
lad
had
sat
and
speculated
much
on
the
extremes
of
experience
in
the
life
of
a
busy
practitioner
it
was
to
this
same
house
that
johnny
took
burns
next
a
house
reached
by
a
long
drive
through
wonderful
grounds
to
a
palace
of
a
home
within
which
the
man
with
his
arm
in
the
sling
disappeared
with
precisely
the
same
rather
brusque
and
hurried
bearing
characteristic
of
him
everywhere
but
johnny
could
not
see
within
if
he
had
his
honest
eyes
might
have
opened
still
wider
on
his
way
upstairs
burns
was
intercepted
by
the
master
of
the
house
you
decided
to
go
with
us
doctor
burns
i
hope
the
question
was
put
in
the
fashion
of
a
person
who
expects
but
one
answer
but
the
answer
proved
to
be
not
that
one
expected
i
sorry
but
i
ca
do
it
burns
left
hand
in
the
cordial
grip
which
expresses
hearty
liking
was
retained
while
william
walworth
who
was
accustomed
to
be
able
to
arrange
all
things
to
his
pleasure
by
the
simple
expedient
of
paying
whatever
it
might
cost
stared
into
the
bright
hazel
eyes
which
met
his
with
their
usual
straightforward
glance
ca
but
you
must
my
dear
doctor
pardon
me
but
i
feel
that
no
ordinary
considerations
can
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
my
daughter
needs
your
care
on
this
journey
her
mother
and
i
have
agreed
that
her
wish
to
have
you
with
us
must
be
fulfilled
it
an
essential
factor
in
her
it
not
essential
at
all
walworth
miss
evelyn
is
well
started
on
the
road
to
full
health
she
has
only
to
keep
on
my
going
with
you
would
be
a
mere
matter
of
pleasing
her
and
that
not
in
the
least
his
smile
softened
the
words
which
struck
upon
the
ear
of
the
magnate
with
an
unaccustomed
sound
walworth
released
burns
hand
his
manner
stiffening
slightly
i
must
differ
with
you
doctor
i
feel
that
at
this
stage
pleasure
is
a
thing
to
be
planned
for
she
has
taken
this
fancy
to
have
you
with
us
on
the
mediterranean
cruise
we
agree
to
land
you
and
send
you
home
at
the
end
of
a
couple
of
months
if
you
positively
feel
that
you
ca
neglect
your
practice
longer
but
let
me
remind
you
doctor
that
your
fee
will
be
made
to
cover
all
possible
income
from
your
practice
during
that
time
and
i
shall
not
be
contented
to
measure
its
size
by
it
was
burns
turn
to
stiffen
within
if
he
did
not
let
it
show
outwardly
he
spoke
positively
and
finally
even
william
walworth
saw
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
urge
a
man
who
said
quite
quietly
i
thought
it
over
as
i
promised
you
and
decided
against
it
i
assure
you
i
appreciate
the
honour
you
would
do
me
and
i
should
immensely
like
the
experience
but
i
know
my
going
is
not
necessary
to
miss
evelyn
recovery
and
that
the
only
thing
that
could
make
me
hesitate
i
go
up
and
see
her
at
once
if
you
will
forgive
my
haste
i
have
a
busy
day
before
william
walworth
looked
after
him
as
he
ran
up
the
stately
staircase
and
his
thoughts
were
somewhat
as
johnny
caruthers
had
been
more
of
a
man
crippled
like
that
than
any
i
know
i
wonder
why
he
wo
go
i
wonder
but
he
wo
that
settled
now
to
appease
evelyn
he
not
find
that
so
burns
did
not
find
it
easy
he
sat
down
beside
the
convalescent
a
patient
who
had
everything
on
her
side
with
which
to
win
her
chosen
physician
consent
to
stay
by
her
till
she
should
be
in
the
possession
once
more
of
the
blooming
beauty
which
had
made
her
one
of
the
envied
of
the
earth
he
told
her
in
the
direct
manner
he
had
used
with
her
father
that
he
could
not
fall
in
with
their
plans
when
he
came
away
he
was
tingling
all
over
it
had
been
so
plain
she
had
tried
to
disguise
it
but
she
was
where
she
could
not
run
to
cover
and
he
had
seen
it
all
it
gave
him
no
pleasure
he
was
not
that
sort
he
was
sorry
for
the
girl
but
he
was
not
in
the
least
anxious
about
her
she
would
get
over
it
it
was
not
his
fault
he
was
on
that
if
ever
he
had
been
coolly
however
kindly
professional
in
his
bearing
it
had
been
in
this
home
of
great
wealth
where
it
would
have
gone
against
his
inmost
grain
to
have
seemed
to
court
liking
if
anything
his
orders
had
been
more
curt
his
concessions
fewer
his
whole
treatment
of
the
case
on
simpler
lines
than
it
might
have
been
in
almost
any
less
pretentious
home
with
which
he
was
familiar
he
ran
down
the
stone
steps
in
eager
haste
to
be
gone
his
vision
still
engaged
with
the
reproachful
look
evelyn
mother
had
given
him
when
she
heard
of
his
incredible
refusal
to
accompany
the
walworths
on
the
expedition
in
search
of
recuperation
and
enjoyment
for
the
idolized
only
daughter
this
settles
me
with
them
to
the
end
of
time
i
suppose
he
said
to
himself
as
the
car
ran
down
the
drive
he
straightened
his
shoulders
with
a
sense
of
thankfulness
that
his
practice
was
not
often
in
the
homes
of
the
comparatively
few
people
who
can
afford
to
buy
even
that
most
precious
of
commodities
the
time
of
others
when
that
time
has
been
consecrated
to
certain
uses
not
going
to
stop
for
lunch
doctor
inquired
young
caruthers
anxiously
as
the
round
of
calls
went
on
and
one
passed
with
the
imp
in
a
portion
of
the
city
remote
from
the
hotel
at
which
burns
was
accustomed
to
refresh
himself
and
johnny
when
home
was
out
of
the
question
we
go
to
the
hospital
next
and
i
shall
be
there
a
couple
of
hours
you
can
go
and
fill
up
then
i
must
be
back
at
the
office
by
four
for
so
the
day
went
the
busy
physician
who
goes
out
of
town
for
even
a
five
days
vacation
must
plan
for
it
and
do
much
arranging
in
various
ways
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
would
still
be
many
weeks
before
burns
could
attempt
surgery
again
he
was
having
plenty
to
do
only
the
determination
to
get
away
this
time
without
fail
made
it
possible
for
him
to
go
but
there
would
be
never
a
time
when
he
could
better
be
spared
and
he
meant
to
let
nothing
hinder
his
purpose
the
arm
coming
on
well
was
doctor
buller
verdict
late
that
afternoon
as
he
gave
the
healing
member
its
usual
manipulation
and
massage
it
takes
patience
to
wait
though
does
it
burns
never
tried
a
broken
arm
myself
but
i
should
say
that
hand
must
be
itching
to
be
at
work
in
the
itching
it
burning
blistering
scarifying
i
never
knew
how
i
liked
that
part
of
my
work
till
i
had
to
come
down
to
an
exclusive
practice
in
pills
and
plasters
grayson
doing
a
stunt
that
would
have
driven
me
mad
with
envy
if
i
could
have
stopped
to
look
on
doing
it
cleverly
too
by
the
report
i
had
from
van
horn
just
now
when
van
takes
the
trouble
to
praise
another
man
it
means
means
it
been
forced
from
him
commented
buller
besides
van
enjoys
praising
grayson
to
you
he
enjoyed
your
smashed
arm
too
the
old
fraud
was
he
ever
so
decent
to
you
before
burns
laughed
you
ca
strike
fire
that
way
today
he
declared
hold
on
you

going
to
put
that
arm

oh
i
say
for
with
his
good
left
arm
burns
was
threatening
his
professional
friend
in
a
way
that
looked
ominous
but
a
laugh
was
in
his
eye
now
that
he
had
got
his
way
and
the
altercation
ended
in
a
fire
of
jokes
then
burns
stood
up
you
a
jewel
buller
boy
said
he
you
brought
me
through
in
great
shape
it
was
a
nasty
fracture
and

me
an
arm

as
good
as
new
i
grateful

that

look

yours
griggs

my
village
practice

i
hope

your
trip

be
a
concentrated
pleasure
to
be
crammed
into
five
days
and
still
make
you
look
like
a
schoolboy
just
let
out
observed
buller
as
burns
turned
with
his
band
on
the
a
dose
does
have
to
be
big
to
be
powerful
rejoined
burns
opening
the
door
eh
buller
called
after
the
departing
bulk
of
his
friend
do
let
it
carry
you
too
far
up
you
might
come
down
with
a
thud
he
right
enough
there
was
what
burns
murmured
to
himself
as
he
caught
the
elevator
in
the
great
building
in
which
buller
office
was
a
crowded
corner
i
may
come
down
in
just
that
style
but
better
that
than
any
more
of
this
dead
level
of
suspense
i
do
think
i
could
stand
that
one
more
he
and
johnny
caruthers
whirled
home
in
the
imp
to
find
burns
village
office
as
crowded
as
buller
city
one
it
was
late
before
he
could
get
his
dinner
and
after
it
he
was
kept
busy
turning
calls
over
to
other
men
it
was
the
usual
experience
to
have
work
pile
up
during
the
last
hours
as
if
fate
were
against
his
breaking
his
chains
and
meant
to
tie
him
hand
and
foot
i
going
to
get
out
of
this
right
now
he
announced
suddenly
to
miss
mathewson
an
hour
before
train
time
as
he
turned
away
from
a
siege
over
the
telephone
with
one
hysterical
lady
who
felt
that
her
life
depended
upon
his
remaining
to
see
her
through
an
attack
of
indigestion
if
i
do
something
will
come
in
that
will
pull
hard
to
keep
me
home
and
i
not
going
to
be
kept
i
trust
you
not
to
look
me
up
for
the
next
hour
for
i
not
tell
you
where
i
going
and
you
ca
guess
you
know
be
a
good
he
wrung
her
hand
looking
at
her
with
that
warmth
of
friendliness
which
he
was
accustomed
when
in
the
mood
to
bestow
on
her
recognizing
how
invaluable
she
was
to
him
and
never
once
recking
what
it
meant
to
her
to
be
so
closely
associated
with
him
she
answered
in
her
usual
quiet
way
wishing
him
a
safe
journey
and
bidding
him
be
very
careful
of
the
arm
no
longer
protected
except
by
the
silken
sign
that
injury
had
been
done
in
a
crowd
you
know
they
wo
notice
the
sling
she
warned
him
wo
they
well
if
my
trusty
left
ca
protect
my
battered
right
i
forgotten
my
boxing
tricks
do
be
anxious
about
that
little
friend
see
that
amy
mathewson
has
a
good
time
in
my
absence
will
you
she
looking
just
a
bit
worn
to
she
smiled
but
her
eyes
did
not
meet
his
she
dared
not
let
them
with
all
his
kindness
to
her
he
did
not
often
speak
with
the
real
affection
which
was
in
his
voice
now
she
understood
that
he
was
for
some
reason
keyed
high
over
his
prospective
journey
even
higher
than
he
had
been
ten
days
before
when
on
the
point
of
leaving
and
she
knew
well
enough
where
he
was
going
though
he
had
not
told
her
it
would
have
taken
hours
to
go
to
washington
spend
a
brief
time
there
and
return
it
was
going
to
take
five
days
to
go
to
south
carolina
remain
long
enough
to
transact
his
business
was
it
business
and
come
back
and
there
had
been
no
more
attempts
to
write
letters
by
way
of
an
amanuensis
the
affection
for
his
assistant
in
his
manner
to
her
was
genuine
she
did
not
doubt
that
but
it
did
not
deceive
her
for
a
moment
so
she
did
not
let
her
eyes
meet
his
they
rested
instead
on
the
scarfpin
which
buller
had
termed
a
peach
but
they
did
not
see
it
she
could
not
remember
when
it
had
been
so
hard
to
maintain
that
quiet
control
of
herself
which
had
long
since
made
her
employer
cease
to
reckon
with
the
possibilities
of
fire
beneath
burns
stole
away
with
johnny
and
the
imp
without
so
much
as
letting
his
neighbours
know
of
his
intentions
he
had
made
sure
that
they
were
all
well
that
no
incipient
scarlet
fever
or
invading
measles
was
threatening
them
he
smiled
to
himself
as
the
car
went
past
the
chester
house
to
think
how
interested
they
would
be
to
know
where
he
was
going
but
he
got
safely
off
and
nobody
opened
a
door
at
sound
of
the
imp
to
call
to
him
to
come
in
a
minute
because
somebody
seemed
not
quite
well
and
then
after
all
he
ran
upon
arthur
chester
and
at
the
city
station
to
which
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
go
although
the
stopped
for
a
at
the
village
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
tried
to
dodge
his
best
friend
but
he
did
not
succeed
his
shoulders
were
too
conspicuous
he
could
not
get
away
going
to
see
an
patient
at
this
hour
of
night
queried
chester
coming
up
warmly
interested
as
best
friends
have
a
trick
of
being
in
spite
of
all
that
can
be
done
to
avert
their
curiosity
where
else
would
i
be
going
i
do
know
where
else
but
i
doubt
if
it
to
see
a
patient
an
air
about

not
professional

er
you
ca

going
to
washington

fairly
running
to
keep

with
burns

how

burns
turned
about
shook
his
fist
at
arthur

seized
his
bag
rushed
through
the
gateway
and
boarded
the
last
of
the
long
string
of
pullmans
on
the
platform
he
pulled
off
his
hat
and
waved
it
at
his
friend

could
forgive
anybody
for
anything

chapter
xiii
in
which
he
makes
no
evening
call
burns
opened
the
white
gate
it
was
sagging
a
little
on
its
hinges
and
walked
up
the
path
between
the
rows
of
liveoaks
to
the
portico
of
the
still
stately
if
somewhat
timeworn
and
decayed
mansion
among
the
shrubbery
it
was
just
at
dusk
and
far
away
somewhere
a
whippoorwill
was
calling
it
was
the
only
sound
on
the
quiet
air
the
door
was
opened
by
an
old
negro
servant
who
hesitated
over
his
answer
to
the
question
put
by
this
unknown
person
looming
up
before
him
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
elmore
was
in
but
she
was
not
well
and
could
not
see
any
visitors
this
evening
is
lessing
in
yas
sah
she
is
but
she
done
tole
me
she
could
see
nobody
she
tekkin
cah
ob
miss
burns
produced
his
card
and
made
a
persuasive
request
the
old
darky
led
the
way
to
a
long
nearly
dark
apartment
where
the
scent
of
roses
mingled
with
the
peculiar
odour
of
old
mahogany
and
ancient
rugs
and
hangings
the
servant
lit
a
tall
antique
lamp
with
crystal
pendants
hanging
from
its
shade
the
light
from
which
fell
upon
a
bowlful
of
crimson
roses
so
that
they
glowed
richly
he
left
burns
departing
with
a
shufing
step
and
an
air
of
grudging
the
strange
gentleman
the
occupancy
of
the
room
although
it
was
to
be
for
only
so
long
as
it
would
take
to
bring
back
word
that
neither
of
the
ladies
would
see
him
burns
sat
still
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
then
as
no
further
sound
could
be
heard
in
the
quiet
house
he
became
restless
his
pulses
beat
rather
heavily
and
to
quiet
them
or
the
sense
of
them
he
got
up
and
walked
about
pausing
at
one
of
the
long
french
windows
to
gaze
out
into
the
dusky
labyrinth
of
a
garden
where
he
could
just
make
out
paths
winding
about
among
the
bushes
the
night
was
mild
and
the
window
stood
ajar
as
if
some
one
had
lately
come
in
then
he
turned
and
saw
her
she
had
almost
reached
him
but
he
had
not
heard
her
her
footfall
upon
the
old
turkey
carpet
with
its
faded
roses
and
lilies
had
been
so
light
she
was
in
white
and
the
light
from
the
old
lamp
shone
on
her
arms
end
face
and
brought
out
the
shadows
of
her
hair
and
eyes
she
put
out
both
hands
then
quickly
drew
back
one
as
her
glance
fell
upon
the
sling
and
gave
him
her
left
smiling
but
he
drew
the
arm
that
had
been
broken
out
of
its
support
and
held
it
out
please
take
this
hand
too
he
said
it
will
be
its
first
experience
and
perhaps
it
will
put
new
life
into
it
it
pretty
limp
she
laid
hers
in
it
very
gently
looking
down
at
it
as
his
fingers
closed
slowly
over
hers
that
doing
very
well
i
should
think
she
said
it
barely
time
for
it
to
be
independent
yet
is
it
about
time
i
had
something
of
a
wrestle
with
doctor
buller
to
get
him
to
leave
the
splints
off
how
warm
and
soft
your
hand
is
this
one
of
mine
has
forgotten
how
the
touch
of
another
hand
i
sure
you
ought
not
to
use
it
yet
please
put
it
back
in
the
she
drew
her
own
hand
gently
away
it
occurred
to
him
that
while
he
had
been
absent
from
her
he
had
not
been
able
to
recall
half
her
charm
and
that
if
he
had
he
would
never
have
been
able
to
wait
half
so
long
before
pursuing
her
down
into
this
southern
haunt
of
hers
he
drew
a
full
contented
breath
at
last
he
said
i
am
face
to
face
with
you
it
worth
the
in
the
lamplight
it
seemed
to
him
the
rose
cast
a
reflection
on
her
face
which
he
had
not
observed
at
first
i
so
sorry
aunt
lucy
is
able
to
see
you
tonight
she
said
unless
she
would
consent
go
see
you
professionally
she
really
ought
he
held
up
his
hand
not
unless
she
is
in
serious
straits
please
he
begged
i
fled
from
patients
only
to
find
them
all
the
way
down
on
the
train
i
do
know
what
there
can
be
about
me
to
suggest
to
a
conductor
that
i
the
man
he
looking
for
to
attend
some
emergency
case
but
he
seems
to
spot
me
only
at
the
station
before
this
did
i
get
released
from
the
last
of
the
series
let
me
forget
my
profession
for
a
bit
if
i
can
just
now
i
only
a
man
who
come
a
long
way
to
see
you
is
it
really
you
he
leaned
forward
studying
her
intently
his
head
with
its
coppery
thatch
of
heavy
hair
showed
powerful
lines
in
the
lamplight
beneath
his
dark
throws
the
hazel
eyes
glowed
black
it
certainly
i
she
answered
lightly
and
being
i
with
the
mistress
of
the
house
prevented
from
showing
you
hospitality
i
must
offer
it
she
begged
me
to
make
you
comfortable
and
to
tell
you
she
would
see
you
in
the
morning
you
had
a
long
journey
you
must
want
the
comfort
of
a
room
and
hot
water
i
ring
for
old
she
crossed
the
room
and
pulled
an
upon
which
a
bell
was
heard
to
jangle
far
away
the
old
darky
reappeared
i
should
have
gone
to
a
hotel
burns
said
if
i
could
have
found
one
in
the
there
is
none
and
if
there
had
been
aunt
lucy
would
have
been
much
hurt
to
have
you
go
there
where
did
you
leave
your
bag
at
the
station
i
can
stay
only
for
a
night
and
a
day
so
it
a
small
i
send
young
sam
for
it
now
let
sam
take
you
to
your
room
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
give
you

bother
about
supper
at
this
hour
i
only
want
you
want
what
you
are
to
have
some
of
sue
delicious
southern
she
smiled
at
him
as
he
looked
back
at
her
following
the
old
servant
she
been
in
the
family
for
forty
years
and
she
loves
to
have
company
to
appreciate
her
dishes
sam
you
are
to
help
doctor
burns
he
has
had
a
broken
when
burns
came
down
fresh
from
a
bath
and
comfortable
with
clean
linen
he
smelled
odours
which
made
him
realize
that
eager
as
he
was
for
other
things
he
was
human
enough
to
be
intensely
hungry
with
a
healthy
man
appetite
so
he
surrendered
himself
to
the
fortunes
that
now
befell
him
old
sam
conducted
him
to
the
a
quaintly
attractive
apartment
where
illumined
the
bare
mahogany
of
the
round
table
laid
with
a
large
square
of
linen
at
his
place
and
set
with
delicate
ancient
china
and
silver
ellen
lessing
was
already
there
in
a
chair
opposite
the
one
set
for
him
a
figure
to
which
his
eyes
were
again
drawn
irresistibly
and
upon
which
they
continued
to
rest
as
he
took
his
seat
sam
disappeared
toward
the
kitchen
and
burns
spoke
in
a
low
voice
across
the
table
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
a
dream
said
he
hours
ago
i
was
rushing
about
hundreds
of
miles
from
here
trying
to
attend
to
the
wants
of
a
lot
of
people
who
seemed
determined
not
to
let
me
get
away
now
i
down
here
in
the
midst
of
all
this
quiet
and
peace
with
you
before
me
to
look
at
and
nobody
to
demand
anything
of
me
for
at
least
hours
it
all
too
good
to
be
it
seems
rather
odd
to
me
too
she
answered
letting
her
eyes
stray
from
his
and
rest
upon
the
bowl
of
japonicas
of
a
glowing
pink
which
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
table
the
made
little
starry
points
in
her
dark
eyes
as
she
looked
at
the
blooms
the
last
person
in
the
world
i
was
expecting
to
see
was
i
suppose
i
was
as
far
from
your
thoughts
as
your
expectation
he
suggested
how
should
i
be
thinking
of
a
person
who
had
not
written
to
me
for
so
long
i
thought
he
had
forgotten
me
she
asked
and
then
as
he
broke
out
into
a
delighted
laugh
at
her
expense
she
grew
as
pink
as
her
flowers
and
seemed
to
welcome
the
return
of
sam
bearing
a
trayful
of
sue
good
things
to
eat
fried
chicken
and
sweet
potatoes
beaten
biscuit
and
fragrant
coffee
had
a
flavour
all
their
own
to
burns
that
night
he
ate
as
a
hungry
man
should
yet
never
forgot
his
companion
for
a
moment
or
allowed
her
to
imagine
that
he
forgot
her
and
by
and
by
the
meal
was
over
and
the
two
rose
from
the
table
i
must
go
and
see
that
auntie
is
comfortable
for
the
night
if
you
will
excuse
me
for
half
an
hour
said
the
person
he
had
come
to
see
will
you
wait
in
the
i
will
have
sam
bring
you
some
late
i
wait
and
no
magazines
thank
you
i
can
fill
the
time
somehow
he
answered
but
do
let
it
be
more
than
the
will
you
he
watched
her
until
she
disappeared
from
his
sight
at
the
turn
of
the
staircase
landing
then
went
in
to
pace
up
and
down
the
long
room
his
left
arm
folded
over
his
right
after
the
fashion
he
had
acquired
since
the
right
arm
became
useless
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
interval
she
came
back
he
met
her
at
the
door
are
the
duties
all
done
he
inquired
all
done
for
the
present
i
must
look
in
on
auntie
by
and
by
but
i
think
she
is
going
to
may
she
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
just
and
there
nothing
more
you
feel
it
incumbent
upon
you
to
do
for
me
no
more
sending
me
to
my
room
no
more
waiting
upon
me
by
sam
no
more
feeding
me
till
my
capacity
is
reached
is
there
really
no
notion
in
your
mind
as
to
how
you
can
put
off
the
coming
hour
his
voice
had
its
old
whimsical
inflection
but
there
was
a
deeper
note
in
it
too
she
parried
him
gently
yet
not
quite
so
composedly
as
was
her
wont
why
should
i
want
to
put
if
off
are
we
going
to
sit
down
and
have
a
delightful
talk
i
want
to
hear
all
about
bob
and
martha
and
all
of
them
and
about
your
work
since
i
saw
you
want
to
hear
all
about
those
things
do
you
i
had
the
impression
that
we
discussed
them
quite
thoroughly
while
i
was
at
supper
still
i
can
go
over
them
all
again
if
you
insist
it
may
take
up
another
five
minutes
and
when
one
is
fencing
for
time
even
five
minutes
it
was
his
old
way
with
a
vengeance
there
was
a
saying
of
arthur
chester
current
among
his
and
burns
friends
that
it
never
was
of
any
use
to
try
to
evade
red
pepper
when
once
he
had
begun
to
fire
upon
your
defenses
with
his
eyes
searching
you
and
his
insolent
tongue
putting
point
blank
questions
to
you
you
might
as
well
capitulate
first
as
last
there
being
no
conceivable
answer
to
this
thrust
about
fencing
for
time
even
for
a
woman
experienced
in
replying
skilfully
to
men
under
all
sorts
of
conditions
ellen
lessing
was
forced
to
look
up
or
play
the
part
of
a
shy
girl
so
she
looked
up
lifting
her
head
bravely
there
really
was
nothing
else
to
do
it
was
all
in
his
face
he
had
not
come
all
those
hundreds
of
miles
to
pay
her
an
evening
call
nor
did
he
mean
to
be
put
off
longer
his
eyes
held
hers
she
could
not
withdraw
them
it
odd
he
said
speaking
slowly
how
like
a
magnet
drawing
a
steel
bar
you
drawn
me
down
here
an
irresistible
force
i
wonder
if
the
magnet
feels
the
attraction
too
could
it
pull
so
hard
if
it
did
there
was
a
long
minute
during
which
neither
stirred
it
might
have
been
the
counterpart
of
that
minute
months
back
when
they
had
first
observed
each
other
recognition
it
was
perhaps
at
the
very
first
there
could
be
no
question
about
the
recognition
now
it
went
deep
suddenly
he
slipped
his
right
arm
out
of
the
sling
before
she
could
draw
breath
she
was
in
the
circle
of
his
arms
but
he
had
not
touched
her
am
i
wrong
he
was
saying
has
it
pulled
both
ways
from
the
first
it
must
be
as
useless
for
the
magnet
to
resist
as
for
the
bar
and
when
they
have
come
within
a
certain
distance
of
each
other
if
red
pepper
left
arm
caught
her
in
the
stronger
grasp
the
right
did
all
and
more
than
all
that
could
have
been
expected
of
it
it
was
his
right
arm
which
slowly
drew
her
hands
up
one
after
the
other
and
indicated
to
them
that
their
place
was
locked
together
behind
his
neck
an
old
garden
in
south
carolina
is
a
place
to
lure
the
northerner
before
breakfast
next
morning
burns
was
walking
down
the
paths
feasting
his
gaze
and
his
sense
of
fragrance
on
the
clumps
of
blue
and
white
violets
the
clusters
of
gay
crocuses
the
splendid
spikes
of
roman
hyacinths
but
he
did
not
fail
to
keep
track
of
all
doorways
in
sight
and
when
she
appeared
at
the
open
french
window
of
the
he
was
there
in
a
trice
offering
her
a
bunch
of
purple
violets
and
feasting
his
eyes
upon
her
morning
freshness
i
still
dreaming
i
think
said
he
when
he
had
drawn
her
back
into
the
quiet
room
long
enough
to
satisfy
himself
with
the
active
demonstration
that
possession
means
privilege
and
had
himself
fastened
the
violets
in
the
front
of
her
crisp
white
morning
dress
dreaming
that
i
can
stay
down
here
in
this
wonderful
paradise
with
you
and
not
go
back
to
the
slave
life
i
you
would
never
be
happy
away
from
that
slave
life
long
you
know
she
reminded
him
the
rush
of
it
is
the
joy
of
it
to
how
will
it
be
to
you
i
shall
be
yours
you
remember
till
joe
tressler
or
any
other
wants
me
then
i
but
you
always
come
back
to
me
said
she
and
will
you
be
content
with
that
so
long
as
you
want
to
come
he
looked
steadily
into
her
eyes
and
his
own
took
fire
want
to
come
back
i
waited
a
long
time
to
find
the
woman
i
could
be
sure
i
should
always
want
to
come
back
to
i
thought
there
would
never
be
such
a
woman
not
for
an
erratic
fellow
like
me
but
now
i
wondering
how
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
stay
chapter
xiv
in
which
he
defies
superstition
hades
of
hymen
red
are
you
making
calls
this
morning
why
not
i
not
to
be
married
till
noon
am
i
i
say
take
me
with
you
will
you
i
want
to
go
along
with
a
man
who
has
the
nerve
to
see
patients
up
to
the
last
minute
before
his
wedding
takes
less
nerve
than
to
sit
around
and
wait
for
the
fateful
hour
i
should
say
come
on
if
you
think
you
have
time
to
dress
when
you
get
back
it
may
be
close
have
you
got
to
dress
yourself
demanded
arthur
chester
settling
himself
in
the
car
beside
its
driver
or
shall
you
go
to
the
altar
in
tweeds
with
april
mud
on
your
boots
rather
than
not
get
there
yes
but
i
can
dress
in
half
the
time
you
can
always
could
and
necessity
has
developed
the
art
look
here
there
is
any
april
mud
the
roads
are
oh
i
suppose
if
i
were
booked
for
a
wedding
journey
in
the
green
imp
before
the
leaves
were
fairly
out
i
should
be
able
to
see
any
mud
myself
as
it
is
well
i
do
know
the
colour
of
the
bride
motoring
clothes
but
i
presume
they
be
adapted
to
the
circumstances
i
never
saw
her
look
anything
but
ready
for
whatever
situation
she
happened
to
be
in
that
a
trick
that
serve
her
many
a
good
turn
as
the
wife
of
burns
eh
red
the
imp
whirled
about
the
country
all
the
morning
having
made
an
early
start
the
car
was
in
fine
fettle
like
a
horse
that
has
been
trained
for
a
race
although
it
was
beginning
its
second
season
it
had
never
been
in
better
trim
for
business
the
engine
having
been
cared
for
and
seldom
abused
was
running
more
smoothly
than
when
it
had
been
first
put
upon
the
road
the
imp
had
had
a
fresh
coat
of
the
which
gave
it
its
name
and
its
brasswork
was
shining
as
only
johnny
caruthers
by
long
and
untiring
labors
could
make
metal
shine
it
had
that
morning
acquired
a
attached
to
its
rear
which
was
soon
to
receive
a
motor
trunk
at
that
moment
receiving
its
final
consignments
in
the
macauley
house
and
there
were
several
other
new
fittings
about
the
machine
which
indicated
that
it
was
presently
to
be
put
to
uses
which
had
never
been
required
of
it
before
the
imp
drew
up
in
front
of
the
hospital
chester
looked
anxiously
at
his
watch
for
the
time
that
morning
for
heaven
sake
hurry
red
he
urged
women
are
the
dickens
about
having
a
wedding
late
and
it
ten
minutes
of
eleven
now
noon
comes
sure
and
soon
and
at
noon
allow
me
to
remind
you
burns
nodded
keep
cool
boy
he
recommended
no
use
getting
excited
before
a
critical
but
he
disappeared
at
a
pace
fast
enough
to
satisfy
chester
who
sat
back
and
said
to
himself
that
had
come
nearer
giving
the
crisis
before
him
its
appropriate
name
than
he
had
ever
heard
done
before
he
became
anxious
again
however
before
burns
returned
and
his
watch
was
in
his
hand
when
the
prospective
bridegroom
bolted
out
of
the
hospital
door
and
ran
for
his
car
as
if
he
had
not
a
moment
to
spare
glad
to
see
you
losing
your
head
a
trifle
at
last
commented
chester
as
the
imp
turned
a
dizzy
curve
and
shot
away
it
the
only
proper
thing
but
we
really
enough
time
if
you
do
stop
anywhere
else
what
the
matter
good
lord
man
you
get
nabbed
if
you
speed
up
like
this
within
limits
you
cut
it
and
do
talk
i
got
to
make
time
was
all
the
answer
or
explanation
he
received
and
chester
with
the
wisdom
of
long
association
with
red
pepper
at
his
pepperest
obeyed
as
they
approached
the
house
burns
spoke
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
left
the
city
go
in
and
tell
the
bunch
i
have
to
do
an
operation
at
the
hospital
as
quick
as
i
can
get
my
stuff
and
drive
back
there
i
be
back
at
great
christopher
man
but
i
can
be
back
by
two
ellen
will
the
deuce
she
will
do
ask
me
to
explain
to
i
wo
i
do
it
myself
you
tell
the
the
imp
shot
up
the
driveway
burns
jumped
out
and
ran
to
his
office
five
minutes
later
instrument
bag
in
hand
he
ran
out
again
miss
mathewson
following
he
bolted
in
at
the
macauleys
front
door
chester
had
already
broken
the
incredible
news
to
martha
macauley
and
was
standing
out
a
storm
of
expostulations
and
reproaches
as
if
by
any
chance
anybody
could
expect
arthur
chester
to
be
able
to
stop
burns
when
he
had
started
upon
any
course
of
action
whatsoever
but
when
burns
himself
appeared
at
the
doorway
the
situation
came
to
a
crisis
towering
beside
a
group
of
palms
which
decorated
the
foot
of
the
staircase
burns
demanded
to
see
ellen
why
red
you
ca
she
besides
how
can
you
ask
her
to
come
where
i
can
speak
to
her
then
quick
but
she
there
was
no
knowing
how
long
the
sparring
might
have
lasted
or
what
extreme
measures
might
have
been
taken
had
not
a
figure
in
a
floating
garment
with
two
long
braids
of
dark
hair
hanging
over
its
shoulders
appeared
upon
the
staircase
landing
burns
looked
up
saw
it
and
was
up
the
stairs
to
the
landing
before
chester
could
flick
an
eyelash
dear
to
save
a
life
i
want
to
delay
things
just
two
hours
nobody
else
to
do
it
van
horn
was
taken
ill
just
as
he
was
getting
ready
the
only
other
man
who
would
venture
under
the
conditions
grayson
is
out
of
his
arms
were
about
her
as
she
stood
a
step
above
him
so
her
eyes
were
level
with
his
do
it
of
course
she
whispered
and
take
my
love
with
for
one
minute
burns
stayed
to
tell
her
that
he
had
known
she
would
send
him
to
his
duty
then
he
was
off
the
door
slammed
behind
him
and
outside
the
imp
horn
sent
back
a
parting
salute
from
the
bottom
stair
martha
macauley
distressed
young
matron
and
hostess
gazed
up
at
her
sister
who
with
arms
leaning
on
the
rail
at
the
landing
was
smiling
down
at
her
ellen
was
ever
anything
so
crazy
i
did
suppose
red
would
take
time
enough
to
be
married
in
there
everybody
so
few
you
can
easily
telephone
them
all
to
and
the
breakfast
under
way
it
will
are
you
superstitious
enough
not
to
want
to
postpone
your
wedding
demanded
martha
urgently
the
dark
braids
of
hair
swung
violently
as
the
bride
head
was
emphatically
shaken
martha
take
it
back
let
somebody
die
because
i
was
afraid
to
wait
two
hours
i
do
believe
anybody
would
die
insisted
martha
somebody
could
be
found
it
just
red
ridiculous
craze
for
surgery
i
always
said
rather
operate
than
eat
now
it
seems
he
rather
operate
than
be
but
at
this
moment
a
large
determined
hand
came
over
her
mouth
from
behind
as
james
macauley
junior
arriving
upon
the
scene
asserted
his
authority
he
was
in
bathrobe
and
slippers
having
been
excitedly
interviewed
by
chester
through
the
bathroom
door
quit
fussing
marty
the
thing
ca
be
helped
and
if
ellen
mind
i
do
know
why
we
should
if
we
were
having
a
houseful
it
would
be
fierce
but
with
only
ourselves
and
the
chesters
and
the
family
and
red
people
i
go
telephone
harding
as
martha
freed
herself
from
the
silencing
hand
the
front
door
opened
again
this
time
it
was
richard
warburton
burns
young
sister
anne
also
in
somewhat
informal
attire
over
which
she
had
thrown
an
evening
coat
she
surveyed
the
group
with
laughing
eyes
she
herself
had
been
married
within
the
year
it
absurd
is
it
she
cried
but
it
just
like
red
ellen
knows
that
do
you
dear
ellen
not
only
take
him
for
better
and
for
worse
but
for
present
and
for
absent
mostly
absent
but
we
rather
proud
of
him
over
at
the
house
father
walking
up
and
down
and
saying
no
other
fellow
would
have
done
it
and
mother
all
tearful
and
smiling
dick
wanted
to
go
in
with
him
but
of
course
miss
mathewson
had
to
go
he
seldom
operates
without
it
so
uncertain
when
he
get
back
mourned
martha
still
unreconciled
i
made
miss
mathewson
promise
to
telephone
the
moment
she
should
know
it
lucky
the
wedding
guests
are
all
in
the
family
is
it
ellen
dear
pretty
anne
ran
up
the
stairs
to
the
landing
i
really
do
see
how
after
he
caught
sight
of
you
in
that
fascinating
garb
with
your
hair
down
he
could
ever
tear
himself
away
you
positively
the
loveliest
thing
i
ever
saw
in
all
my
life
and
i
almost
out
of
my
senses
with
joy
that
you
to
be
my
sister
even
though
i
never
saw
you
in
the
world
till
yesterday
i
always
said
when
red
did
care
for
anybody
for
keeps
she
be
a
jewel
red
pepper
came
back
at
precisely
twenty
minutes
of
three
his
patient
had
given
him
a
bad
hour
of
anxiety
immediately
after
leaving
the
table
and
he
could
not
desert
her
until
she
had
rallied
but
he
felt
easy
about
her
now
and
he
had
arranged
to
leave
her
in
hands
buller
who
did
not
do
major
surgery
himself
but
was
a
most
competent
man
when
it
came
to
the
care
of
surgical
patients
after
operation
burns
brought
amy
mathewson
back
with
him
though
she
had
begged
to
be
allowed
to
stay
with
the
case
and
not
be
at
my
wedding
cried
red
pepper
in
exuberant
spirits
why
i
could
be
properly
married
without
you
to
see
me
through
upon
which
she
had
smiled
and
obeyed
him
and
taken
a
tighter
grip
upon
herself
as
he
put
her
into
the
green
imp
for
the
last
ride
together
that
was
what
it
was
to
her
though
she
might
yet
go
with
him
a
thousand
times
to
help
him
in
his
work
to
him
it
was
a
quick
and
joyful
journey
back
to
his
marriage
all
right
mother
and
dad
he
exulted
coming
in
upon
them
in
their
festal
array
he
shook
hands
with
his
father
and
his
he
kissed
his
mother
then
he
ran
for
his
own
room
where
bobby
burns
just
being
finished
off
by
anne
herself
superbly
dressed
shrieked
with
rapture
at
the
sight
of
him
red
at
last
i
laid
everything
ready
you
only
to
jump
into
your
bath
i
turned
on
the
water
when
dick
saw
the
imp
down
the
road
you
dare
have
a
vestige
of
a
surgical
odour
about
you
when
you
come
out
in
precisely
seventeen
minutes
and
the
bridegroom
was
ready
to
the
last
coppery
affair
on
his
head
have
i
a
odour
anne
he
asked
as
he
came
up
to
her
she
buried
her
face
on
his
shoulder
both
arms
about
him
regardless
of
her
finery
you
the
dearest
sweetest
old
trump
of
a
brother
that
ever
lived
and
you
smell
like
sunshine
and
fresh
air
she
cried
whereat
he
shook
with
laughter
and
patted
her
back
as
she
clung
to
him
promise
me
red
she
begged
lifting
her
head
that
you
wo
let
anything
anything
keep
you
from
going
off
with
ellen
in
the
imp
been
so
lovely
about
this
horrid
delay
but
i
always
suspicious
of
you
promise
i
promise
you
this
agreed
her
brother
wherever
the
imp
and
i
go
after
the
minister
has
said
the
words
for
this
two
weeks
ellen
shall
go
with
chester
said
dick
warburton
as
he
stood
in
that
gentleman
company
looking
over
a
stupendous
assortment
of
wedding
gifts
which
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
nobody
outside
the
family
had
been
asked
to
see
redfield
pepper
burns
married
overflowed
two
large
rooms
into
the
upper
hall
and
almost
over
the
railing
will
you
tell
me
who
in
the
name
of
time
sent
that
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
display
of
gold
silver
and
tinware
that
i
ever
saw
and
i
at
the
end
of
my
astonishment
but
that
is
it
a
joke
no
joke
whatever
declared
chester
it
comes
from
one
of
r
red
devoted
friends
his
own
invention
and
the
point
of
the
thing
is
that
the
making
of
that
is
going
to
be
the
making
of
the
worst
of
a
patient
red
ever
stood
by
i
really
believe
joe
tressler
going
to
get
a
patent
on
it
which
also
will
be
red
doing
but
this
is
a
special
particular
made
of
extra
fine
materials
suitable
for
a
wedding
gift
well
well
mused
burns
and
what
millionaire
sent
the
diamond
pendant
by
jove
i
have
seen
finer
jewels
than
those
this
side
of
the
that
came
from
the
walworths
i
believe
take
it
all
together
it
a
great
collection
is
it
it
shows
up
the
odder
because
ellen
have
the
freak
gifts
put
to
one
side
or
even
thrown
into
a
sort
of
refining
shadow
fix
your
eye
on
that
rainbow
quilt
will
you
dicky
alongside
of
the
florentine
tapestry
that
quilt
would
put
out
your
eye
if
you
gazed
upon
it
steadily
so
let
up
on
it
by
regarding
this
would
that
that
came
from
johnny
caruthers
said
a
richly
modulated
low
voice
behind
him
please
set
it
down
carefully
arthur
the
two
men
wheeled
to
see
the
bride
come
to
the
defense
of
her
wedding
gifts
behind
her
loomed
her
husband
laughing
over
her
head
his
eyes
none
the
less
tender
like
hers
for
the
queer
presents
which
meant
no
less
of
love
and
gratitude
than
the
costlier
gifts
of
which
there
was
no
mean
array
i
see
you
married
him
patients
and
all
ellen
burns
declared
richard
warburton
on
the
whole
it
your
wisest
course
the
less
he
knows
you
mind
their
devotion
to
him
mind
it
she
gave
him
the
flash
of
which
the
soft
black
eyes
were
brilliantly
capable
dick
i
have
no
gift
i
like
so
well
as
that
you
do
know
the
story
but
i
do
and
it
means
to
me
fidelity
to
duty
and
if
there
one
great
big
thing
in
the
world
i
think
it
that
over
her
head
dick
warburton
nodded
at
his
i
glad
we
got
her
into
the
family
red
said
he
it
a
mighty
rare
thing
to
find
a
beautiful
woman
who
knows
how
to
dress
like
a
picture
with
that
ideal
at
the
back
of
her
head
her
red
if
you
do
come
around
and
knock
you
down
i
let
you
do
it
agreed
burns
soberly
all
his
marriage
vows
were
in
his
face
it
was
quite
dusk
when
the
green
imp
got
away
johnny
caruthers
had
the
satisfaction
of
lighting
up
the
car
lamps
always
a
joy
to
him
and
particularly
so
for
even
the
oil
taillight
bore
witness
to
his
trimming
and
polishing
till
its
red
eye
could
gleam
no
brighter
as
for
the
front
lamps
and
the
searchlight
the
imp
progress
would
be
as
down
an
avenue
of
brilliance
if
its
driver
allowed
them
all
full
play
upon
the
road
she
in
great
trim
johnny
said
burns
voice
in
his
ear
i
like
her
looks
immensely
i
shall
hate
to
get
a
speck
of
mud
on
meaning
the
lady
doc
asked
johnny
anxiously
there
a
wet
bit
there
under
the
elms
doc
remember
it
would
be
a
pity
to
splash
any
mud
on
her
he
glanced
toward
the
porch
his
freckled
face
eloquent
of
his
admiration
for
the
figure
which
was
the
centre
of
the
group
gathered
there
burns
eyes
followed
his
bob
a
picturesque
small
person
in
his
wedding
attire
of
white
linen
was
attempting
to
tie
ellen
for
her
as
she
stooped
smiling
to
the
level
of
his
eager
little
arms
it
occurred
to
both
master
and
man
as
they
watched
the
child
efforts
to
adjust
the
floating
chiffon
that
veils
however
useful
were
to
be
regretted
when
they
were
allowed
even
partially
to
obscure
faces
like
those
of
red
pepper
wife
i
meant
the
car
lad
explained
burns
laughing
you
done
a
great
piece
of
work
an
her
since
i
brought
her
home
this
afternoon
i
afraid
you
done
some
last
polishing
with
your
wedding
clothes
on
johnny
here
some
thing
to
take
the
spots
oh
doc
breathed
the
boy
not
let
me
do
it
for
you
and
the
money
went
back
into
burns
pocket
and
his
hand
met
johnny
in
a
hearty
grasp
that
better
yet
said
he
and
thank
you
john
if
anybody
but
you
were
sending
me
off
i
ask
if
everything
was
surely
in
the
car
but
i
not
even
ask
you
do
need
to
vowed
the
boy
proudly
and
there
some
things
in
you
do
need
to
know
about
just
extrys
in
case
of
now
that
said
his
employer
is
what
call
proving
one
self
a
the
imp
went
cautiously
through
the
wet
bit
for
it
lay
under
the
corner
and
johnny
caruthers
would
be
watching
but
once
on
the
open
road
outside
the
village
the
pace
quickened
for
late
april
the
roads
were
not
bad
and
if
they
had
been
sloughs
the
imp
could
have
pulled
through
them
she
had
a
great
power
hidden
away
in
those
six
cylinders
of
hers
had
the
imp
you
not
mind
if
i
stop
at
the
hospital
as
we
go
through
questioned
burns
then
we
be
off
out
the
old
west
road
out
of
reach
of
telephones
and
summonses
of
any
sort
but
i
shall
be
just
that
much
do
stop
please
i
sure
you
be
more
satisfied
and
so
shall
she
sat
quietly
in
the
car
while
he
was
gone
looking
up
at
the
lighted
windows
and
thinking
all
sorts
of
sympathetic
thoughts
concerning
those
inside
yet
with
a
tiny
fear
in
her
heart
that
he
would
find
some
new
and
unavoidable
duty
to
detain
him
if
he
should
but
he
was
back
and
as
the
imp
searchlight
fell
upon
his
face
returning
she
read
there
that
he
was
free
doing
well
everything
satisfactory
and
i
not
a
care
in
the
world
he
exulted
as
he
leaped
in
now
we
off
and
never
a
stop
till
put
a
wide
space
between
us
and
the
rest
of
the
green
imp
ran
at
its
quietest
along
the
city
streets
then
through
the
thinning
suburbs
and
finally
with
the
lights
all
behind
them
the
open
country
ahead
the
long
low
car
came
out
upon
the
straight
highway
which
leads
a
hundred
miles
before
it
comes
again
to
any
but
insignificant
hamlets
and
small
rustic
inns
burns
had
said
little
thus
far
but
as
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
now
distant
lights
of
the
city
he
suddenly
spoke
low
out
of
the
quiet
we
out
of
reach
of
everything
and
everybody
nobody
even
knows
the
road
we
taking
we
all
alone
in
the
world
together
you
think
what
that
means
to
me
i
lived
nine
years
at
the
call
of
every
soul
that
wanted
me
hardly
a
vacation
except
for
study
a
fortnight
seems
pretty
short
allowance
for
a
honeymoon
we
take
a
longer
one
when
we
go
to
germany
in
the
fall
but
for
two
weeks
he
looked
down
at
her
in
the
april
starlight
he
bent
to
finish
the
statement
whatever
it
might
have
been
upon
her
lips
for
speech
failed
him
then
with
a
happy
laugh
he
gave
the
green
imp
her
head
