preface
this
book
describes
the
life
of
the
feudal
ages
in
terms
of
the
concrete
the
discussions
center
around
a
certain
seigneury
of
aliquis
if
no
such
barony
is
easily
identifiable
at
least
there
were
several
hundred
fiefs
scattered
over
western
christendom
which
were
in
essential
particulars
extremely
like
it
and
its
baron
conon
and
his
associates
were
typical
of
many
similar
individuals
a
little
worse
or
a
little
better
who
abounded
in
the
days
of
philip
augustus
no
custom
is
described
which
does
not
seem
fairly
characteristic
of
the
general
period
to
focus
the
picture
a
specific
region
northern
france
and
a
specific
year
have
been
selected
not
many
matters
have
been
mentioned
however
which
were
not
more
or
less
common
to
contemporaneous
england
and
germany
nor
have
many
usages
been
explained
which
would
not
frequently
have
been
found
as
early
as
or
as
late
as
northern
france
was
the
homeland
of
feudalism
and
hardly
less
so
of
chivalry
while
by
general
consent
the
years
around
mark
one
of
the
great
turning
epochs
of
the
middle
ages
we
are
at
the
time
of
the
development
of
french
kingship
under
philip
augustus
of
the
climax
and
the
beginning
of
the
waning
of
the
crusading
spirit
of
the
highest
development
of
gothic
architecture
of
the
full
blossoming
of
the
popular
romance
literature
and
of
the
beginning
of
the
entirely
dissimilar
but
even
more
important
friar
movement
to
make
the
life
of
the
middle
ages
live
again
in
its
pageantry
and
its
squalor
its
superstition
and
its
triumph
of
christian
art
and
love
is
the
object
of
this
study
many
times
has
the
author
been
reminded
of
the
between
sublime
good
and
extreme
evil
everywhere
apparent
in
the
feudal
epoch
with
every
effort
at
impartiality
whether
praising
or
condemning
it
is
dangerously
easy
to
write
in
superlatives
although
the
preparation
of
this
book
was
not
undertaken
without
that
knowledge
and
investigation
of
those
mediæval
authors
ecclesiastics
and
laymen
upon
which
every
significant
study
of
this
kind
must
rest
every
scholar
will
recognize
the
author
debt
to
many
modern
specialists
to
th
wright
lacroix
luchaire
justin
smith
and
chéruel
the
acknowledgments
are
very
specific
to
leon
gautier
they
must
be
more
specific
still
it
is
a
great
misfortune
that
his
masterpiece
is
no
longer
current
in
a
good
english
translation
the
words
in
quotation
sprinkled
through
the
text
are
usually
from
pertinent
mediæval
writers
except
where
they
purport
to
be
direct
snatches
of
conversation
to
my
colleague
in
this
university
august
krey
who
has
read
and
criticized
the
manuscript
with
friendly
fidelity
and
professional
alertness

lay
in

later

of

perhaps
you
may
have
trouble
in
finding
any
such
places
upon
the
maps
of
mediæval
france
in
that
case
i
must
tell
you
that
they
did
not
lie
so
far
from
burgundy
champagne
and
blois
that
the
duke
and
his
vassal
the
baron
could
not
have
many
brave
feuds
with
the
seigneurs
of
those
principalities
nor
so
far
from
paris
that
peddlers
and
pilgrims
could
not
come
hence
or
go
thither
pretty
often
nor
the
baron
of
aliquis
sometimes
journey
to
the
king
court
to
do
his
loyal
devoir
to
his
high
suzerain
or
to
divert
himself
with
many
lordly
pleasures
about
when
king
philip
augustus
was
near
his
end
there
was
exceptional
peace
in
northern
france
and
conditions
around
aliquis
were
entirely
normal
we
purpose
therefore
with
the
help
of
our
lady
of
holy
aliquis
himself
and
perhaps
also
of
that
very
discreet
queen
morgue
the
wife
of
julius
cæsar
and
the
mother
of
king
oberon
to
visit
the
aforesaid
barony
as
it
existed
at
that
time
we
shall
look
around
us
unseen
by
the
inhabitants
but
able
to
ask
many
questions
and
to
get
pertinent
answers
thereby
shall
we
gather
much
knowledge
and
that
too
not
about
aliquis
only
for
this
little
world
by
itself
is
a
as
it
were
of
a
great
part
of
france
nay
of
all
feudal
europe
it
is
fortunate
that
we
are
suffered
when
we
make
this
return
journey
to
the
middle
ages
to
arrive
not
long
after
the
year
a
century
or
two
earlier
one
might
have
found
conditions
decidedly
more
crude
disgusting
one
would
have
indeed
been
tempted
to
doubt
whether
from
so
lawless
and
uncultivated
a
world
any
progressive
civilization
could
really
develop
on
the
other
hand
had
we
postponed
the
excursion
until
say
we
would
have
found
a
society
already
becoming
sophisticated
and
to
no
slight
extent
modernized
the
true
mediæval
flavor
would
have
been
partially
lost
but
represents
the
epoch
when
the
spirit
of
the
middle
ages
had
reached
its
full
development
the
world
was
still
full
of
ignorance
squalor
and
violence
yet
there
were
now
plenty
of
signs
of
a
nobler
day
france
was
still
scattered
with
feudal
castles
and
tales
of
baronial
ruthlessness
abounded
but
the
rise
of
the
royal
power
and
the
growth
of
the
chartered
communal
towns
were
promising
a
new
political
era
the
bulk
of
the
people
were
still
illiterate
peasants
and
many
of
the
nobility
even
felt
very
awkward
when
fumbling
over
books
but
the
monasteries
had
never
been
so
full
of
worthy
activities
and
of
very
genuine
learning
thousands
of
scholars
were
trudging
to
the
university
of
paris
and
meantime
even
in
the
more
starving
towns
were
rising
gothic
churches
and
cathedrals
combining
in
their
soaring
fabrics
not
merely
the
results
of
supreme
architectural
genius
but
a
wealth
of
masterpieces
of
sculpture
and
of
colored
glass
which
were
to
draw
visitors
of
later
days
from
the
very
ends
of
the
earth
the
crusading
fervor
had
somewhat
waned
but
around
the
castles
there
were
still
elderly
knights
who
had
once
followed
richard
the
lion
hearted
or
philip
augustus
upon
the
great
third
crusade
to
palestine
likewise
a
good
many
younger
cavaliers
who
had
shared
the
military
glory
and
moral
disgrace
of
the
fourth
crusade
which
had
ended
not
with
the
recovery
of
jerusalem
but
the
sack
and
seizure
of
christian
constantinople
at
rome
the
great
and
magnanimous
pope
innocent
iii
had
hardly
ceased
to
reign
while
the
founders
of
the
remarkable
friar
movement
that
new
style
of
monasticism
which
was
to
carry
the
message
of
the
church
closer
to
the
people
francis
the
apostle
of
love
and
dominic
the
apostle
of
learning
were
still
alive
and
active
the
world
therefore
was
looking
forward
the
middle
ages
were
close
to
apogee
sidenote
the
fief
of
aliquis
we
purpose
to
tell
what
may
be
found
on
the
barony
of
aliquis
first
at
the
castle
itself
and
in
the
household
of
messire
the
seigneur
then
in
the
villages
of
peasants
round
about
next
in
the
abbey
slightly
removed
and
lastly
in
the
chartered
town
and
cathedral
seat
of
the
bishop
a
few
miles
further
off
but
first
one
must
ask
about
the
origin
of
the
principality
and
how
there
came
to
be
any
such
barony
at
all
for
aliquis
would
have
been
an
exceptional
seigneury
if
it
had
not
had
considerable
history
behind
it
and
had
not
represented
the
growth
of
several
different
elements
the
castle
of
aliquis
lies
at
the
junction
of
two
rivers
the
smaller
of
these
the
rapide
tumbles
down
from
some
hills
cutting
a
gorge
through
the
dense
beech
forest
until
it
runs
under
a
precipitous
slope
then
dashes
into
the
greater
more
placid
current
of
the
claire
the
claire
is
an
affluent
perhaps
of
the
seine
perhaps
of
the
loire
it
is
navigable
for
flat
barges
a
good
many
miles
above
its
junction
with
the
rapide
and
the
tolls
upon
this
commerce
swell
the
revenue
at
the
triangle
formed
by
the
converging
streams
rises
an
abrupt
rocky
plateau
practically
inaccessible
from
the
banks
of
either
river
and
which
can
be
approached
only
from
the
third
side
where
the
land
slopes
gently
away
from
the
apex
of
the
triangle
here
rise
some
jagged
crags
marking
out
the
place
as
a
natural
fortress
most
castles
which
dot
feudal
europe
are
thus
located
in
the
most
advantageous
spot
in
their
respective
regions
possibly
human
habitations
have
existed
upon
this
promontory
ever
since
god
drove
adam
and
eve
out
of
eden
if
we
consult
brother
boniface
the
librarian
at
the
local
monastery
the
person
in
the
district
the
good
old
man
will
tell
us
that
long
before
the
romans
came
the
ancient
druids
now
in
hell
had
their
pagan
altars
here
and
sacrificed
human
victims
under
a
great
oak
some
chiseled
masonry
found
on
the
spot
also
indicates
an
extensive
settlement
in
roman
days
when
gaul
was
a
province
of
the
cæsars
of
course
all
the
pious
people
know
that
under
the
persecuting
emperor
diocletian
the
holy
aliquis
himself
a
centurion
in
the
legions
was
shot
to
death
with
burning
arrows
because
he
preferred
christ
to
jupiter
and
that
the
place
of
his
martyrdom
is
at
the
new
abbey
church
about
a
league
from
the
castle
sidenote
founding
of
the
castle
nevertheless
secular
history
is
not
precise
until
after
the
time
of
the
mighty
charlemagne
under
his
feeble
successor
charles
the
bald
tradition
affirms
that
the
vikings
scandinavian
barbarians
came
up
the
greater
river
ascended
the
claire
in
their
long
dragon
ships
then
on
the
site
of
the
present
castle
they
established
a
stockaded
camp
whence
they
issued
to
ravage
the
country
this
was
about
but
after
a
year
they
departed
leaving
desolation
behind
them
about
another
band
of
vikings
came
with
similar
foul
intent
but
they
met
a
different
reception
the
saints
had
raised
up
a
brave
protector
for
the
christian
folk
of
those
lands
very
uncertain
is
the
ancestry
of
the
redoubtable
warrior
heribert
who
about
seized
the
rocky
triangle
at
the
mouth
of
the
rapide
and
built
the
first
castle
of
aliquis
perhaps
he
was
descended
from
one
of
charlemagne
famous
frankish
counts
he
did
indeed
only
what
was
then
being
done
everywhere
to
check
the
scandinavian
hordes
he
built
a
castle
and
organized
the
levies
of
the
region
hitherto
footmen
into
an
effective
cavalry
force
this
castle
was
anything
save
the
later
majestic
fortress
it
was
merely
a
great
square
tower
of
rough
masonry
perched
on
the
crag
above
the
streams
around
it
was
a
palisade
of
heavy
timbers
strengthened
on
the
landward
side
by
a
ditch
inside
this
compound
were
huts
for
refugees
storehouses
for
fodder
and
rude
stalls
for
the
cattle
to
stop
passage
up
the
claire
a
heavy
chain
of
iron
was
stretched
across
the
river
and
stone
piers
were
sunk
at
shallow
places
thus
forcing
boats
to
pass
close
under
the
fortress
in
range
of
descending
missiles
where
the
chain
was
landed
there
was
built
another
smaller
stone
tower
all
the
crossing
then
had
to
be
by
skiffs
although
somewhat
later
an
unsteady
bridge
was
thrown
over
the
stream
the
second
expedition
of
vikings
found
that
these
precautions
had
ruined
their
adventure
they
lost
many
men
and
a
dragon
ship
when
they
tried
to
force
the
iron
chain
heribert
new
cavalry
cut
off
their
raiding
parties
finally
they
departed
with
thinned
numbers
and
scant
spoils
heribert
was
hailed
as
savior
of
the
region
just
as
other
champions
notably
the
great
count
odo
at
the
siege
of
paris
won
similar
successes
elsewhere
on
a
larger
scale
the
vikings
had
departed
but
heribert
tower
remained
so
began
the
castle
of
aliquis
heribert
had
taken
possession
ostensibly
as
the
king
man
claiming
some
royal
commission
but
as
the
power
of
charlemagne
feeble
rulers
dwindled
heribert
heirs
presently
forgot
almost
all
their
allegiance
to
their
distant
royal
master
this
was
merely
as
seemed
the
case
about
all
through
the
region
then
coming
to
be
called
france
castles
were
rising
everywhere
sometimes
to
repel
the
vikings
sometimes
merely
to
strengthen
the
power
of
some
local
chief
once
erected
the
lords
of
those
castles
were
really
little
princes
able
to
defy
the
very
weak
central
authority
to
capture
a
considerably
less
formidable
fortalice
than
aliquis
implied
a
tedious
siege
such
as
few
kings
would
undertake
save
in
an
emergency
the
result
was
that
ere
heribert
had
almost
ceased
to
trouble
about
the
king
the
person
they
genuinely
feared
was
the
local
duke
of
quelqueparte
another
feudal
seigneur
with
more
followers
and
more
castles
than
they
partly
from
prudence
partly
from
necessity
they
had
done
homage
to
him
become
his
men
and
as
his
vassals
rode
to
his
wars
the
dukes
in
turn
full
of
their
own
problems
and
realizing
the
strength
of
aliquis
seldom
interfered
in
the
fief
save
on
very
serious
occasions
the
barons
of
aliquis
therefore
acted
very
nearly
like
sovereign
princes
they
of
course
had
their
own
gallows
with
power
of
life
and
death
waged
their
own
personal
wars
made
treaties
of
peace
and
even
coined
a
little
money
with
their
own
superscription
barons
by
the
grace
of
god
they
boasted
themselves
which
meant
that
they
obeyed
the
duke
and
suzerain
the
king
very
little
and
we
fear
god
not
a
great
deal
sidenote
turbulent
barons
in
the
recent
centuries
however
the
barony
had
changed
hands
several
times
about
the
lord
had
the
folly
to
refuse
his
ordinary
feudal
duty
to
the
duke
of
quelqueparte
the
latter
roused
himself
enlisted
outside
aid
and
blockaded
and
starved
out
the
castle
of
aliquis
the
unfortunate
baron
duly
adjudged
traitor
and
felon
by
his
peers
his
fellow
vassals
was
beheaded
the
duke
then
bestowed
the
fief
with
the
hand
of
the
late
owner
niece
upon
sire
rainulf
a
younger
son
of
a
viscount
who
had
visited
the
court
bringing
with
him
an
effective
and
fifty
sturdy
followers
sire
rainulf
however
died
while
in
the
first
crusade
the
reigning
duke
next
tried
to
give
the
barony
to
another
favorite
warrior
but
the
son
of
the
late
baron
proved
himself
of
sturdy
stuff
he
fought
off
his
suzerain
and
enlisted
allies
from
burgundy
the
duke
was
forced
therefore
to
leave
him
in
peace
presently
about
another
baron
died
survived
only
by
a
daughter
her
uncles
and
cousins
did
their
best
to
expel
this
poor
lady
and
induced
the
suzerain
duke
to
close
his
eyes
to
their
deeds
but
fortunately
the
new
baroness
had
been
very
pious
the
influence
of
the
great
bernard
of
clairvaux
was
exerted
thereby
persuading
king
louis
vii
to
warn
the
duke
that
if
he
could
not
protect
his
vassals
the
king
would
do
justice
so
the
lady
bertrada
was
given
in
marriage
to
a
respectable
flemish
cavalier
gui
who
ruled
the
barony
with
only
the
usual
wars
he
left
two
sons
garnier
and
henri
sire
henri
the
younger
lived
at
the
inferior
castle
of
petitmur
went
on
the
fourth
crusade
and
perished
in
the
fighting
around
constantinople
ere
the
french
and
venetians
sacked
the
city
garnier
the
elder
received
of
course
the
great
castle
he
was
the
uncle
of
the
baron
conon
iii
the
son
of
henri
and
the
present
lord
of
aliquis
it
is
well
said
by
the
monks
that
the
blessed
feel
joys
in
paradise
all
the
keener
because
a
little
earlier
they
have
escaped
from
the
pangs
and
fires
of
purgatory
certes
for
all
laymen
and
clerics
on
the
aliquis
fiefs
there
was
purgatory
enough
in
baron
garnier
day
to
make
the
present
sage
rule
of
baron
conon
seem
tenfold
happy
the
late
seigneur
ruled
about
twenty
years
filled
up
with
one
round
of
local
wars
oppression
of
the
small
and
contentions
with
the
great
baron
garnier
was
assuredly
a
mighty
warrior
never
was
he
unhorsed
in
jousting
or
in
mêlée
his
face
was
one
mass
of
scars
and
he
had
lost
an
ear
plenty
of
landless
knights
and
wolfish
men
at
arms
rioted
around
his
donjon
his
provosts
and
foresters
knew
how
to
squeeze
the
poor
of
the
seigneury
and
by
this
income
and
by
the
ransoms
from
numerous
captives
he
was
able
to
rebuild
the
castle
of
aliquis
according
to
the
first
military
art
of
the
day
sidenote
crimes
of
baron
garnier
but
his
sins
were
more
than
the
hairs
of
his
grizzled
head
having
taken
dislike
to
his
wife
and
the
bishop
refusing
an
annulment
he
kept
the
poor
lady
ada
mewed
up
in
one
chamber
for
years
and
according
to
many
stories
loaded
her
with
chains
and
spared
not
tortures
until
in
mercy
she
died
however
he
had
plenty
of
less
regular
consorts
the
castle
courts
had
swarmed
with
loud
women
the
favorites
of
himself
and
his
familiars
and
with
their
coarse
unacknowledged
brats
no
pretty
peasant
girl
honor
was
safe
in
those
parts
as
for
the
prisoners
after
messire
conon
came
into
power
it
was
a
marvel
the
quantity
of
human
bones
gnawed
by
the
rats
which
they
took
out
of
the
lower
dungeons
as
well
as
how
they
released
four
wretches
who
had
been
incarcerated
in
the
dark
so
long
that
they
were
blinded
needless
to
say
the
compartments
of
the
gallows
never
lacked
their
swinging
skeletons
women
still
hush
their
squalling
children
with
be
silent
or
baron
garnier
will
get
you
yet
with
all
these
deeds
this
baron
affected
great
hospitality
he
kept
a
roaring
hall
with
ready
welcome
for
any
cavalier
who
enjoyed
deep
drinking
and
talking
of
horses
women
falcons
and
forays
and
a
good
many
seigneurs
found
his
alliance
useful
so
he
continued
his
evil
ways
until
praised
be
our
lady
of
mercies
he
came
to
a
fit
end
thrice
he
had
been
excommunicated
by
the
bishop
thrice
he
had
been
readmitted
to
ghostly
favor
thanks
to
large
gifts
toward
the
new
cathedral
at
pontdebois
then
he
let
his
men
murder
a
priest
who
was
traveling
with
a
precious
chalice
so
he
was
excommunicated
a
fourth
time
while
in
this
perilous
state
though
boasting
that
he
would
soon
make
his
new
terms
with
the
church
his
companion
in
sin
suger
of
the
iron
arm
quarreled
with
him
over
their
cups
and
ran
him
through
with
a
boar
spear
the
baron
lived
just
long
enough
to
see
suger
hewn
in
pieces
by
his
comrades
then
he
died
priestless
of
course
and
unabsolved
cursing
god
and
crying
piteously
for
help
from
the
devil
christians
cross
themselves
when
they
think
of
his
fate
hereafter
garnier
left
no
legitimate
children
he
was
on
very
cold
terms
with
his
brother
widow
the
lady
odelina
who
was
rearing
her
two
sons
and
daughter
at
petitmur
but
odelina
had
faced
her
down
and
clung
tightly
to
her
own
little
fief
she
had
given
her
children
a
courteous
and
pious
education
and
induced
a
neighboring
seigneur
to
take
her
eldest
son
conon
to
nourish
as
his
squire
and
rear
to
be
a
knight
at
length
came
her
reward
the
youth
was
knighted
by
the
count
of
champagne
three
weeks
before
his
evil
uncle
perished
then
the
suzerain
duke
was
glad
to
have
aliquis
pass
to
so
competent
a
vassal
as
young
sire
conon
this
is
a
bare
suggestion
of
the
contentions
feuds
and
downright
wars
of
which
the
barony
has
been
the
scene
and
yet
aliquis
has
probably
been
freer
from
such
troubles
than
most
of
its
neighbors
sidenote
baronial
fiefs
and
vassals
although
this
castle
is
the
center
of
baron
conon
power
it
is
by
no
means
his
only
strong
place
he
has
three
other
smaller
castles
besides
petitmur
which
will
go
to
his
brother
that
he
sometimes
inhabits
but
which
he
ordinarily
rules
through
castellans
in
the
villages
upon
the
fief
there
are
some
ten
thousand
peasants
whom
he
governs
through
his
provosts
also
there
depend
on
him
his
own
noble
vassals
about
twelve
sires
petty
nobles
each
with
his
own
small
castle
or
tower
hamlet
of
peasants
and
right
to
low
justice
these
vassals
follow
the
aliquis
banner
and
otherwise
contribute
to
the
baron
glory
that
seigneur
himself
is
likewise
advocate
secular
guardian
of
the
neighboring
abbey
of
aliquis
an
honorable
post
involving
delicate
dealings
with
the
lord
abbot
also
a
few
leagues
away
lies
the
good
town
of
pontdebois
the
baron
as
will
be
explained
has
very
important
relations
with
that
city
in
addition
he
holds
of
the
bishop
there
resident
some
farms
with
hunting
and
fishing
rights
for
this
inferior
fief
he
does
homage
of
course
not
to
the
duke
of
quelqueparte
but
to
the
bishop
of
pontdebois
some
years
previous
when
the
duke
and
bishop
were
at
war
the
baron
was
obligated
to
send
twenty
knights
to
fight
for
the
duke
but
also
six
to
fight
for
the
bishop
the
scriptures
warn
us
against
trying
to
serve
two
masters
but
the
baron
happily
made
shift
to
keep
the
two
contingents
of
his
little
array
from
engaging
with
one
another
until
his
two
overlords
had
made
peace
in
addition
to
all
the
above
conon
holds
still
another
small
castle
at
quite
a
distance
for
which
he
does
homage
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
a
fact
promising
more
complications
when
quelqueparte
and
burgundy
as
is
most
likely
go
to
war
finally
he
holds
a
large
farm
from
his
otherwise
equal
the
baron
of
harcourt
here
he
is
sure
to
cut
his
feudal
devoir
to
a
minimum
and
leave
the
lord
of
harcourt
to
consider
whether
to
pocket
his
pride
risk
a
private
war
or
attempt
a
lawsuit
before
their
mutual
suzerain
the
duke
of
quelqueparte
the
baron
conon
would
gladly
be
the
direct
vassal
of
the
king
the
higher
your
suzerain
the
higher
on
the
whole
your
own
glory
in
the
feudal
firmament
but
the
duke
would
resent
bitterly
any
attempt
to
get
his
vassals
away
and
all
the
other
nobles
would
support
him
baron
conon
must
wait
therefore
perhaps
until
the
present
elderly
duke
is
dead
and
the
duchy
falls
under
feeble
heirs
then
he
will
find
the
astute
king
if
philip
augustus
is
still
reigning
only
too
willing
and
able
to
meet
him
halfway
at
present
however
conon
is
on
good
terms
with
the
duke
although
he
is
just
as
jealous
himself
to
prevent
his
own
sires
from
holding
directly
from
the
duke
as
the
latter
is
to
check
the
baron
going
over
to
the
king
everywhere
there
is
this
friction
over
subinfeudation
the
vassal
of
my
vassal
is
my
vassal
that
is
the
angry
comment
daily
all
in
all
the
seigneury
of
aliquis
thus
covers
three
hundred
square
miles
whereof
about
is
controlled
by
the
baron
as
his
personal
domain
and
the
remainder
by
his
vassals
perhaps
there
are
two
hundred
similar
baronies
and
countships
dotting
france
some
larger
some
smaller
but
in
their
histories
feudal
relationships
and
general
problems
much
alike
this
fief
however
is
especially
fortunate
in
that
the
baron
possesses
an
old
charter
wrung
from
some
tottering
carolingian
king
giving
him
the
right
to
collect
a
sack
of
grain
a
large
truss
of
hay
or
a
similar
quota
in
kind
from
every
loaded
barge
traversing
down
the
navigable
claire
also
to
levy
a
copper
obol
for
every
christian
foot
passenger
and
three
obols
for
every
mounted
traveler
or
jew
mounted
or
walking
crossing
the
very
important
bridge
by
the
castle
these
tolls
give
messire
many
fine
suits
of
armor
buy
silk
gowns
for
the
baroness
and
make
all
the
local
seigneurs
anxious
to
marry
their
daughters
to
the
baron
sons
as
soon
as
the
boys
can
be
knighted
sidenote
a
superior
type
of
baron
aliquis
we
have
said
is
happy
in
its
present
seigneur
monks
villeins
and
petty
nobles
agree
in
praising
baron
conon
when
a
seigneur
is
practically
a
sovereign
everything
depends
upon
his
character
if
the
saints
desire
to
punish
certain
christians
for
their
sins
let
them
merely
send
them
an
evil
or
only
an
inefficient
quarrelsome
baron
like
the
unlamented
garnier
he
can
soon
make
their
lives
into
a
perfect
gehenna
conon
iii
has
now
ruled
for
more
than
ten
years
he
has
kept
out
of
all
private
wars
but
one
a
feat
almost
exceptional
but
in
that
one
war
he
struck
so
hard
and
so
skillfully
that
his
opponent
the
viscount
of
foretvert
swore
on
the
relics
to
a
peace
which
cost
him
a
village
of
peasants
and
the
transfer
of
two
petty
sires
to
the
aliquis
fealty
conon
fought
also
in
the
great
battle
of
beauvais
so
as
to
win
the
personal
praise
of
the
king
himself
he
compounded
with
the
abbey
over
the
division
of
the
income
of
a
farm
in
a
manner
which
left
him
and
the
abbot
firm
friends
a
singular
piece
of
diplomacy
better
still
he
held
to
his
point
about
some
hunting
rights
with
the
bishop
of
pontdebois
and
finally
won
most
of
his
claims
without
being
even
temporarily
subjected
to
excommunication
his
peasants
pay
their
imposts
loyally
for
the
baron
not
merely
protects
them
from
the
raids
of
brigands
and
rival
feudatories
he
also
represses
worse
pillagers
still
his
own
seigneurial
officers
who
were
ravaging
harpies
in
all
the
little
thatched
villages
through
baron
garnier
day
therefore
conon
is
called
a
very
gentle
seigneur
which
means
that
he
is
every
inch
a
lord
and
which
term
does
not
prevent
him
from
swinging
a
heavy
sword
and
from
knocking
down
a
villein
with
his
own
fist
when
there
is
need
of
teaching
a
lesson
sidenote
a
baronial
family
as
for
conon
family
his
good
mother
lady
odelina
is
now
resting
under
the
stones
of
the
abbey
church
but
she
lived
to
see
her
wedded
to
adela
the
daughter
of
a
rich
picard
sire
a
dame
of
many
virtues
the
marriage
has
been
blessed
with
two
healthy
sons
françois
and
anseau
the
pampered
tyrants
of
all
the
castle
folk
the
baron
household
also
includes
his
younger
brother
aimery
who
has
just
reached
the
age
for
knighthood
and
his
marriageable
sister
alienor
so
far
the
family
had
been
marvelously
harmonious
there
has
been
none
of
those
passages
at
arms
between
elder
and
younger
brothers
which
often
make
a
castle
the
antechamber
to
hell
adela
is
the
very
dame
beloved
of
husband
and
revered
by
vassals
and
villeins
but
whose
gentleness
like
her
husband
by
no
means
keeps
her
from
flogging
her
maids
when
their
sins
deserve
it
alienor
is
already
going
to
tourneys
and
has
presented
at
least
three
young
knights
with
her
stockings
to
tie
to
their
lances
but
she
knows
that
it
is
a
duty
to
find
a
husband
for
one
sister
and
conon
has
promised
that
whoever
he
selects
will
be
young
brave
and
kindly
therefore
alienor
is
not
borrowing
trouble
as
for
aimery
he
is
proud
of
being
almost
as
good
a
hawker
and
jouster
as
his
brother
he
will
soon
be
knighted
and
rule
over
petitmur
but
his
head
is
full
of
a
visit
to
the
court
of
winning
vast
favor
and
finally
of
being
given
the
only
daughter
and
heiress
of
a
great
count
in
short
of
possessing
a
fief
bigger
than
aliquis
there
then
is
the
little
world
ruled
by
persons
perhaps
a
little
more
honorable
and
kindly
than
the
run
of
north
french
barons

footnotes
long
before

some

the
castle
of
aliquis
the
castle
makes
the
feudal
ages
possible
it
is
because
western
europe
is
covered
with
thousands
of
strongholds
each
of
which
can
stand
off
a
considerable
army
that
we
have
the
secular
institutions
of
the
thirteenth
century
to
be
the
owner
and
lord
of
at
least
one
castle
is
the
dream
of
every
nobleman
and
in
fact
until
he
can
hoist
his
own
banner
from
his
own
donjon
he
hardly
has
a
defined
place
in
the
feudal
hierarchy
sidenote
the
castle
of
aliquis
as
we
have
seen
the
castle
of
aliquis
is
now
nearly
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
since
it
has
been
continuously
inhabited
by
enterprising
owners
its
structure
has
been
as
continuously
changing
however
if
we
had
come
to
the
barony
only
fifty
years
ago
we
would
have
found
a
decidedly
primitive
structure
the
general
plan
of
heribert
original
stronghold
was
then
still
retained
first
on
the
landward
side
of
the
triangle
above
the
two
converging
rivers
there
was
a
rather
deep
moat
next
a
parapet
whereof
the
lower
part
was
made
of
earth
taken
from
this
same
moat
and
upon
the
mound
rose
a
strong
palisade
of
tree
trunks
within
the
palisade
were
barns
outbuildings
and
barracks
for
such
of
the
baron
men
as
did
not
live
in
the
inner
stronghold
then
last
of
all
was
the
donjon
the
castle
proper
a
huge
square
tower
built
with
little
art
but
which
defied
attack
by
mere
solidity
the
entrance
to
this
grim
tower
was
by
a
steep
inclined
plane
leading
to
a
small
door
in
the
second
story
in
case
of
danger
if
the
palisade
were
forced
the
seigneur
and
his
men
retreated
into
the
tower
knocked
down
the
wooden
gangway
and
shouted
defiance
to
the
enemy
the
mass
and
height
of
the
donjon
baffled
any
ordinary
methods
of
attack
save
that
of
blockade
and
starvation
and
there
would
be
six
months
supply
of
wheat
salt
beef
and
ale
in
the
tower
vaults
illustration
typical
castle
of
the
middle
ages
without
large
barbican
court
nevertheless
this
seemingly
impenetrable
fortress
did
not
suffice
in
the
first
place
superior
methods
of
siege
warfare
were
developing
the
stoutest
fortifications
could
be
cracked
in
the
next
place
if
the
donjon
were
hard
to
enter
it
was
almost
equally
hard
to
sally
forth
from
it
no
rapid
sortie
could
be
made
from
the
door
in
the
second
story
the
defense
must
be
wholly
passive
finally
this
stark
masonry
tower
was
a
most
uncomfortable
place
with
its
cavernous
halls
barely
lighted
by
tiny
loopholes
frigid
in
winter
stifling
in
summer
unsanitary
in
short
almost
intolerable
for
habitation
by
a
large
body
of
men
after
the
first
crusade
numerous
cavaliers
came
home
with
great
tales
of
the
fortresses
of
the
byzantines
and
the
saracens
during
the
twelfth
century
consequently
castle
architecture
underwent
a
remarkable
transformation
richard
the
lion
hearted
built
château
gaillard
in
normandy
his
mighty
rival
philip
augustus
built
the
famous
louvre
to
dominate
paris
and
erected
other
castles
with
cylindrical
towers
at
montargis
poissy
dourges
and
elsewhere
already
by
the
plans
are
being
drawn
for
a
great
castle
at
coucy
built
between
and
which
is
to
be
almost
a
model
for
all
subsequent
fortress
builders
until
the
advent
of
gunpowder
sidenote
castle
rebuilt
scientifically
baron
garnier
whatever
his
crimes
had
certainly
understood
the
art
of
war
he
rebuilt
aliquis
in
a
thoroughly
scientific
manner
employing
a
learned
masterbuilder
and
sage
an
elderly
fleming
who
had
seen
the
best
fortifications
of
the
infidels
and
had
lived
long
in
those
famous
fortresses
like
krak
des
chevaliers
which
by
the
mere
excellence
of
construction
had
enabled
small
garrisons
of
western
franks
to
defy
the
full
power
of
saladin
instead
of
a
mere
ditch
palisade
and
then
a
single
vast
tower
aliquis
has
consequently
become
a
huge
complex
of
defenses
within
defenses
each
line
of
resistance
a
little
harder
to
penetrate
and
with
every
outwork
commanded
by
an
inner
fortification
if
at
last
you
come
to
the
central
donjon
it
still
looms
up
above
you
defiant
and
formidable
and
you
can
have
your
fill
of
desperate
fighting
only
perhaps
to
be
bloodily
repulsed
in
the
end
of
course
the
donjon
can
indeed
be
starved
out
but
it
is
not
very
often
that
any
enemy
of
aliquis
will
have
resources
and
persistence
enough
to
keep
his
troops
together
until
the
castle
supplies
are
exhausted
he
must
either
get
possession
pretty
quickly
or
not
at
all
and
garnier
fleming
certainly
took
pains
he
should
not
get
in
quickly
in
examining
aliquis
or
its
rivals
one
must
remember
that
they
are
the
creations
of
men
who
have
devoted
most
of
their
thought
to
the
problems
of
war
every
possible
contingency
has
been
anticipated
the
architect
and
his
employer
have
practically
spent
their
lives
studying
how
can
a
castle
be
made
to
hold
out
as
long
as
possible
being
despite
their
sins
highly
intelligent
men
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
produce
remarkable
results
we
are
approaching
the
castle
as
the
morning
mists
are
lifting
from
the
claire
and
the
rapide
ahead
of
us
out
of
the
dispersing
fog
is
rising
what
seems
a
bewildering
mass
of
towers
walls
battlements
gray
and
brown
with
here
and
there
a
bit
of
green
where
a
little
earth
has
been
allowed
to
lodge
and
a
few
weeds
shoot
forth
high
above
all
soars
the
mass
of
the
great
central
tower
the
donjon
from
the
summit
of
which
baron
conon
banner
is
now
idly
trailing
we
come
down
a
road
that
takes
us
over
the
toll
bridge
across
the
rapide
and
find
ourselves
in
a
kind
of
parade
ground
where
there
are
only
a
few
cattle
sheds
and
possibly
a
rude
cabin
or
two
for
such
of
the
baron
herdsmen
as
must
sleep
outside
overnight
this
open
ground
is
the
scene
for
martial
exercises
rallyings
of
the
vassals
and
even
for
tournaments
many
people
are
headed
toward
the
castle
mostly
from
the
village
of
peasants
just
westward
across
the
river
but
there
is
also
the
subprior
on
a
mule
riding
over
from
the
abbey
and
also
a
messenger
who
has
spurred
down
very
early
from
pontdebois
with
a
communication
from
the
bishop
as
we
near
the
castle
its
tower
and
inner
and
outer
wards
become
more
distinct
we
readily
believe
that
it
took
garnier
architect
three
years
to
carry
through
the
work
that
all
the
peasants
of
the
barony
had
been
put
to
grievous
forced
labor
digging
hewing
and
dragging
stone
or
working
the
great
derricks
and
that
ten
expert
stonecutters
and
fully
eighty
less
skilled
masons
had
been
hired
in
from
paris
rheims
and
orléans
besides
a
master
mason
who
demanded
rewards
that
seemed
outrageous
for
a
mere
villein
and
not
for
a
belted
knight
sidenote
the
barbican
and
lists
these
speculations
end
as
we
come
not
to
the
castle
but
to
a
semicircular
palisade
inclosing
the
regular
gate
on
the
landward
side
this
palisade
is
too
high
to
scramble
over
the
piles
are
too
sharply
pointed
and
stout
enough
to
stand
considerable
battering
this
outwork
is
the
barbican
the
first
of
the
long
series
of
obstacles
awaiting
the
foe
of
course
it
could
not
be
defended
in
a
regular
siege
but
its
purpose
is
to
stop
any
surprise
attack
long
enough
to
enable
the
garrison
to
rally
close
the
great
gate
and
man
the
walls
the
whole
crowd
of
folk
now
entering
make
for
the
heavy
wooden
barrier
which
is
just
being
thrown
open
by
a
rather
sleepy
porter
since
it
is
a
time
of
profound
peace
he
lets
them
all
stream
inside
merely
requiring
everyone
to
leave
his
weapons
in
his
custody
we
pass
unchallenged
thanks
to
the
kind
aforementioned
who
has
rendered
us
as
invisible
as
the
owner
of
gyges
ring
if
however
we
had
been
guests
of
noble
rank
we
would
have
proceeded
onward
to
the
inner
gate
and
rung
loudly
on
a
heavy
metal
gong
hanging
there
one
of
the
squires
would
then
have
greeted
us
if
we
had
been
the
baron
equal
or
superior
in
the
social
scale
conon
himself
would
next
have
come
down
to
lead
us
in
if
somewhat
inferior
we
would
have
been
conducted
by
the
squire
to
the
great
hall
where
we
would
have
removed
hood
and
gloves
before
the
magnate
presented
himself
but
we
have
much
to
examine
ere
we
penetrate
the
seigneurial
hall
once
inside
the
barbican
one
discovers
that
between
this
extreme
barrier
and
the
fortress
proper
there
is
another
open
space
with
a
road
and
another
place
for
equestrian
exercises
extending
from
the
claire
straight
over
to
the
abrupt
slopes
of
the
rapide
the
palisades
run
all
the
way
from
river
to
river
this
space
within
the
barbican
forms
the
lists
where
two
young
sergeants
are
breaking
in
a
balky
stallion
the
lists
are
a
great
convenience
in
peace
time
but
the
real
utility
is
in
war
and
they
are
even
more
important
in
the
castles
that
have
land
on
every
side
they
supply
a
good
road
by
which
men
can
be
hurried
round
the
castle
circuit
in
reasonable
safety
on
the
other
hand
if
the
enemy
suddenly
forces
the
barriers
he
finds
himself
most
awkwardly
in
a
limited
space
between
the
palisade
and
the
castle
moat
with
all
the
arbalists
crossbows
playing
on
him
from
the
walls
above
inside
the
lists
and
next
to
the
masonry
walls
runs
the
moat
it
is
some
twenty
feet
wide
partly
filled
now
with
rain
water
in
the
spring
the
varlets
have
great
joy
here
hunting
frogs
but
as
the
year
advances
it
assuredly
breeds
mosquitoes
it
constitutes
however
another
formidable
barrier
to
an
enemy
and
that
is
its
sole
object
after
crossing
these
lists
the
path
leads
straight
to
the
drawbridge
this
has
just
been
lowered
by
means
of
heavy
counterpoises
swung
on
a
kind
of
trestle
overhead
for
even
in
peace
times
no
seigneur
will
sleep
soundly
before
the
drawbridge
is
up
the
portcullis
the
frame
of
iron
bars
which
is
lowered
whenever
the
bridge
is
raised
has
also
been
hoisted
in
its
groove
by
the
gateway
the
heavy
oaken
gates
faced
with
metal
have
not
been
unbarred
however
a
smaller
door
just
big
enough
for
a
horse
has
been
opened
in
one
of
them
admitting
to
the
castle
proper
despite
the
earlier
scrutiny
at
the
barbican
one
now
catches
a
watchful
eye
at
the
small
window
in
the
turret
close
beside
the
portcullis
the
chief
porter
has
a
very
responsible
position
many
a
fortress
has
been
lost
because
he
has
been
careless
or
unfaithful
he
would
in
any
case
be
chargeable
if
he
admitted
unwelcome
guests
or
idle
rascals
porters
are
often
accused
of
being
gruff
insolent
fat
and
lazy
but
part
of
their
bad
name
comes
because
they
have
to
repel
bad
characters
sidenote
the
bailey
gates
and
towers
and
now
we
are
about
to
enter
the
outer
ward
or
bailey
of
the
castle
of
aliquis
the
walls
and
towers
of
these
outer
defenses
are
less
formidable
than
those
of
the
inner
ward
yet
they
seem
of
massive
thickness
and
imposing
altitude
there
is
a
solid
round
tower
covering
either
side
of
the
gate
to
about
fifteen
feet
these
twain
rise
above
the
moat
naked
and
sheer
then
are
pierced
with
narrow
slits
intended
not
to
let
in
light
but
to
permit
archers
to
cover
every
inch
of
the
way
from
the
barbican
to
the
drawbridge
even
if
the
foe
should
cross
the
moat
shatter
the
portcullis
and
split
open
the
heavy
doors
he
would
be
merely
at
the
beginning
of
terrible
hours
of
and
he
would
be
in
a
narrow
and
low
vaulted
passage
with
many
loopholes
on
either
side
for
archers
and
also
with
slits
in
the
ceiling
for
pouring
down
boiling
oil
seething
pitch
molten
lead
and
other
pleasantries
and
if
he
rushed
past
all
these
forms
of
death
into
the
courts
there
behind
him
capable
still
of
very
stout
defense
would
rise
the
two
strong
gate
towers
rendering
every
attempt
to
the
original
attacking
party
a
with
death
and
making
retreat
equally
dangerous
few
leaders
therefore
will
be
foolish
enough
to
try
to
storm
aliquis
simply
by
a
desperate
rush
against
the
gate
from
the
two
gate
towers
right
and
left
there
extends
a
considerable
stretch
of
sheer
wall
terminating
at
either
extremity
with
two
more
towers
which
mark
the
corners
on
the
landward
side
of
the
fortress
these
four
towers
of
course
by
projecting
far
beyond
this
curtain
wall
are
posted
so
as
to
permit
a
steady
fire
of
missiles
on
any
enemy
who
may
somehow
ensconce
himself
close
under
the
wall
the
two
sections
of
curtain
wall
themselves
are
some
dozen
feet
thick
with
a
firm
walk
along
their
summit
protected
by
a
stone
parapet
to
enable
the
defenders
however
to
drop
stones
and
other
forms
of
destruction
upon
attackers
who
may
be
under
the
very
base
of
the
wall
and
defying
the
bolts
from
the
towers
a
structure
of
heavy
timbers
can
be
built
out
all
along
the
wall
overhanging
the
moat
these
wooden
hordings
are
strong
enough
to
withstand
many
stones
from
the
casting
engines
but
they
can
sometimes
be
set
on
fire
in
a
siege
therefore
they
will
be
covered
with
raw
hides
the
same
will
also
be
put
over
the
conical
wooden
roofs
which
cap
the
towers
since
this
is
a
time
of
peace
however
the
hordings
stand
and
bare
to
cover
the
entire
woodwork
with
hides
will
be
one
of
the
first
tasks
of
the
garrison
in
case
of
a
serious
alarm
as
we
survey
the
outer
walls
of
the
castle
it
is
clear
that
no
enemy
will
try
to
batter
down
the
towers
even
if
he
could
penetrate
their
shells
he
would
merely
find
himself
in
a
dark
cavernous
vaulted
chamber
with
the
defenders
flinging
down
death
from
above
he
would
then
have
to
bore
through
the
inner
wall
nearest
the
court
under
every
disadvantage
the
towers
are
built
so
completely
of
masonry
that
it
is
impossible
to
burn
them
winding
stairs
leading
up
through
the
stonework
conduct
from
one
stage
to
another
and
these
staircases
are
so
narrow
and
tortuous
that
a
single
warrior
with
an
ordinarily
lively
ax
can
stop
a
hundred
men
ascending
the
attack
therefore
must
be
on
the
curtain
walls
but
even
here
supposing
one
has
scaled
the
battlements
more
troubles
are
awaiting
the
only
way
downward
from
the
curtain
walls
is
through
the
towers
at
the
end
of
the
parapets
to
leap
into
the
court
inside
means
broken
bones
the
gangways
along
the
parapet
are
intercepted
at
several
points
by
wooden
bridges
these
can
be
easily
knocked
away
leaving
yawning
gaps
defying
any
leaper
if
you
reach
the
towers
they
are
all
barred
and
the
arbalists
are
shooting
down
on
the
captured
gangways
from
a
dozen
loopholes
finally
be
it
said
each
tower
is
a
little
fortress
by
itself
it
has
its
own
cistern
fireplace
for
cooking
and
storeroom
even
if
isolated
its
garrison
can
hold
out
stoutly
so
much
for
the
task
of
attacking
merely
the
outer
ward
of
aliquis
illustration

of
the
court
and

sidenote
inner

and

the
problems
of
the
towers
and
the
curtain
wall
detain
one
long
for
they
sum
up
the
fundamental
principles
of
fortifications
but
now
before
us
opens
the
broad
court
of
the
bailey
itself
the
scene
of
much
of
the
homely
life
of
the
castle
in
fact
the
place
now
swarms
with
people
busy
with
all
kinds
of
activities
the
pavement
is
none
too
clean
there
are
large
muck
piles
and
one
sees
hens
and
a
few
pigs
and
dogs
foraging
everywhere
a
genuine
village
really
exists
inside
the
bailey
to
the
right
of
the
gate
is
a
rambling
stable
where
in
a
long
row
of
stalls
the
horses
of
the
seigneur
are
champing
their
morning
fodder
near
the
stables
stand
tall
ricks
of
hay
behind
these
are
a
second
line
of
inelegant
wooden
structures
they
are
the
barracks
for
the
less
favored
castle
servitors
and
for
a
part
of
the
men
at
arms
whom
baron
conon
keeps
for
instant
duty
sidenote
buildings
and
life
in
the
bailey
on
the
left
side
of
the
gate
are
several
more
buildings
to
be
noted
are
a
commodious
carpenter
shop
where
saw
and
hammer
are
already
plying
a
smithy
where
at
one
ringing
forge
the
baroness
white
palfrey
is
being
reshod
and
at
another
the
master
armorer
is
putting
a
new
link
into
a
mail
shirt
the
castle
position
is
no
sinecure
he
has
to
keep
a
great
quantity
of
weapons
and
armor
in
constant
order
he
has
to
do
all
the
recurring
small
jobs
around
the
great
establishment
and
in
emergency
to
manufacture
quantities
of
lance
heads
and
arbalist
bolts
as
well
as
perhaps
to
provide
the
metal
work
for
siege
engines
on
which
may
rest
the
fate
of
the
castle
conon
first
armorer
is
accordingly
one
of
the
most
important
and
best
rewarded
of
all
the
servitors
besides
these
workshops
there
is
a
long
storehouse
a
repository
for
not
merely
the
food
but
all
other
kinds
of
supplies
needful
in
a
siege
near
by
stands
a
smaller
shedlike
structure
puzzling
at
first
to
strangers
but
which
explains
itself
by
the
shrill
screams
and
cries
issuing
thence
it
is
the
baron
hawk
house
the
mews
where
the
chief
falconer
is
now
feeding
the
raw
meat
to
the
great
hawks
and
falcons
in
which
his
noble
masters
take
delight
close
to
these
secular
buildings
however
there
rises
somewhat
incongruously
an
elegant
gothic
chapel
with
soaring
pinnacles
a
rose
window
at
the
end
of
the
small
nave
sculptured
saints
flanking
the
portal
and
within
one
finds
glorious
stained
glass
more
saints
images
and
carvings
and
a
rich
altar
this
is
the
little
castle
church
to
which
very
many
dwellers
of
aliquis
including
messire
and
madame
had
repaired
piously
at
gray
dawn
and
where
now
good
father
grégoire
has
just
finished
a
rather
hasty
mass
the
bailey
in
short
is
overrunning
with
activities
horses
are
neighing
cows
are
being
milked
an
overladen
donkey
is
braying
yonder
in
one
corner
is
a
small
building
with
a
tall
chimney
here
is
the
seigneur
great
oven
whither
not
merely
the
castle
folk
but
a
great
number
of
the
peasants
resort
to
bake
their
bread
in
front
of
the
chapel
bubbles
a
little
fountain
and
chattering
women
scantily
attired
are
filling
their
water
pots
children
in
various
degrees
of
nakedness
and
dirtiness
play
everywhere
noises
of
every
kind
blend
in
a
hubbub
lastly
we
notice
close
to
the
inner
drawbridge
another
building
again
with
a
tall
chimney
this
is
the
castle
cookhouse
where
the
dinners
are
prepared
for
the
great
hall
within
a
glance
through
the
door
shows
the
vast
fireplace
where
one
can
roast
a
whole
sheep
or
a
small
beef
entire
the
cookhouse
is
located
here
because
of
the
danger
of
fire
in
the
inner
castle
and
because
the
position
is
convenient
for
the
great
number
of
the
servitors
who
must
eat
in
their
barracks
when
it
is
mealtime
however
this
arrangement
compels
a
prodigious
running
to
and
fro
all
through
the
dinner
hour
between
kitchen
and
hall
on
the
part
of
the
sergeants
and
squires
who
serve
baron
conon
guests
and
family
it
bothers
not
the
appetites
of
pious
christians
that
their
food
is
cooked
amid
contending
odors
and
that
many
of
the
doings
near
the
cookhouse
make
its
condition
extraordinarily
unsanitary
we
have
now
crossed
the
bailey
and
its
teeming
life
before
us
rises
the
inner
ward
of
the
castle
here
are
the
gate
and
the
walls
of
the
bailey
over
again
but
far
more
pretentious
and
formidable
there
is
another
moat
filled
with
muddy
water
another
drawbridge
larger
than
the
outer
one
the
two
gate
towers
are
higher
their
structures
are
thicker
more
solid
the
curtain
walls
are
so
lofty
that
arbalistiers
thereon
can
pick
off
the
enemy
who
may
have
gained
the
parapet
of
the
outer
defenses
finally
between
the
gate
towers
and
the
towers
at
the
end
of
the
curtains
both
to
right
and
left
there
is
interposed
an
extra
tower
making
the
flanking
fire
much
more
close
and
deadly
consequently
the
foe
who
could
force
his
way
into
the
bailey
would
thus
probably
find
it
merely
a
bloody
cockpit
the
retreating
garrison
would
set
fire
to
all
the
rude
wooden
buildings
and
rake
the
outer
court
with
their
bows
and
engines
if
it
would
cost
dearly
to
win
the
bailey
what
would
it
not
cost
to
storm
the
castle
proper
sidenote
inner
court
donjon
and
palais
the
gate
to
the
inner
ward
is
flung
wide
but
the
portcullis
still
slides
in
its
grooves
being
dropped
every
night
to
make
sure
that
low
fellows
from
the
barracks
do
not
prowl
around
the
seigneurial
residence
in
the
darkness
just
at
present
swarms
of
people
are
going
to
and
fro
between
the
two
great
sections
of
the
castle
and
jostling
and
laughing
in
the
narrow
passages
as
we
pass
through
to
the
inner
ward
we
realize
a
certain
touch
of
refinement
the
pavement
is
cleaner
most
of
the
servitors
are
better
dressed
and
better
mannered
before
us
opens
the
great
court
of
the
castle
set
with
stone
flags
and
reasonably
well
swept
here
the
baron
and
his
brother
will
practice
their
martial
exercises
when
the
weather
is
bad
and
they
must
avoid
the
tilting
grounds
here
the
horses
will
be
mounted
when
conon
adela
and
all
their
noble
friends
assemble
to
ride
out
for
hunting
or
hawking
on
either
side
the
stately
towers
set
into
the
walls
frown
downward
but
our
gaze
is
ahead
straight
before
one
rises
first
a
rather
elegant
stone
building
with
large
pointed
windows
and
a
high
sloping
roof
and
then
looming
before
that
an
enormous
round
citadel
one
that
dwarfs
all
the
other
towers
it
stands
at
the
apex
of
the
triangle
on
one
side
is
the
castle
court
but
to
right
and
left
the
crags
at
its
base
are
falling
precipitously
away
to
the
rapide
and
the
claire
the
stone
building
is
the
the
actual
residence
of
the
baron
the
giant
tower
is
the
donjon
the
great
keep
of
the
castle
built
on
the
site
of
heribert
old
stronghold
but
twenty
times
as
formidable
the
is
nearest
to
us
but
since
the
apartments
of
the
seigneur
are
there
and
we
wish
to
examine
these
later
it
is
best
to
pass
around
one
end
thereof
and
visit
the
donjon
first
baron
garnier
had
built
his
donjon
about
one
hundred
and
ten
feet
high
and
some
feet
in
diameter
with
walls
a
dozen
feet
thick
this
size
is
large
but
not
extraordinary
at
coucy
they
are
planning
a
tower
two
hundred
and
feet
high
and
feet
in
diameter
if
garnier
had
built
a
little
earlier
he
would
have
made
it
square
like
that
pitiless
tower
at
loches
which
is
only
one
hundred
feet
high
but
is
feet
on
its
longest
side
to
enter
the
donjon
we
go
over
still
another
drawbridge
although
the
ditch
below
is
dry
and
on
penetrating
a
small
door
in
the
masonry
we
wind
up
a
passageway
through
the
thick
wall
passing
from
the
bright
morning
light
of
the
court
one
seems
plunged
into
pitchy
darkness
strangers
stumble
up
steep
stairways
with
here
and
there
a
twinkle
of
light
from
loopholes
a
couple
of
feet
high
although
barely
wide
enough
at
their
openings
to
allow
the
free
flight
of
an
arrow
far
below
may
be
caught
glimpses
of
the
twinkling
rushing
rapide
and
of
the
bright
green
country
stretching
away
in
the
distance
sidenote
the
donjon
when
aliquis
was
rebuilt
by
baron
garnier
architect
although
the
donjon
was
greatly
improved
much
of
the
old
masonry
of
the
original
tower
was
retained
as
well
as
the
general
arrangement
of
the
staircases
loopholes
and
succession
of
chambers
and
lofts
we
see
what
the
castle
resembled
in
heribert
day
by
a
turn
or
two
in
the
gaunt
entrance
we
come
to
the
original
great
hall
of
the
castle
it
is
offensively
dark
the
windows
are
mere
loopholes
at
the
end
of
deep
passages
let
into
the
walls
even
on
this
balmy
june
morning
the
atmosphere
is
clammy
as
our
eyes
adjust
themselves
however
we
see
that
we
are
in
a
huge
vaulted
chamber
with
a
great
fireplace
and
with
a
kind
of
wooden
gallery
about
eight
feet
above
the
floor
around
the
entire
circuit
in
this
great
chamber
can
be
assembled
a
good
fraction
of
the
entire
garrison
the
seigneur
or
his
spokesmen
standing
in
the
center
or
near
the
fireplace
can
give
orders
which
every
man
present
can
understand
directions
can
thus
be
given
for
any
move
needful
for
the
defense
of
the
castle
illustration
upper
hall
of
the
donjon
as
we
shall
see
there
is
now
a
newer
and
better
hall
in
the
more
modern
and
airy
but
the
older
hall
is
still
used
at
great
feasts
for
the
overflow
of
guests
even
now
are
standing
long
oaken
tables
duly
hacked
by
the
trencher
knives
of
many
boisterous
diners
and
on
the
walls
blackened
by
the
smoke
from
the
great
fireplace
are
hanging
venerable
trophies
of
the
chase
antlers
the
head
of
a
bear
great
boar
tusks
as
well
as
an
array
of
all
kinds
of
hunting
weapons
used
by
departed
generations
if
we
were
to
follow
the
staircase
down
from
the
hall
we
would
come
to
an
even
darker
vaulted
apartment
used
sometimes
as
a
supplementary
dormitory
for
the
humbler
guests
but
also
to
the
astonishment
of
medical
usage
with
small
rooms
set
off
to
be
used
as
a
kind
of
sick
ward
because
every
physician
whether
schooled
at
salerno
cordova
or
montpellier
will
tell
you
that
darkness
is
the
friend
of
health
and
that
few
invalids
can
hope
to
get
better
unless
they
are
kept
as
shaded
and
sequestered
as
possible
sidenote
the
prison
and
the
watch
tower
if
we
wished
to
pursue
still
lower
descending
a
black
staircase
with
lanterns
the
rocks
would
begin
to
drip
dampness
we
could
hear
the
rushing
of
the
rapide
against
the
base
of
the
castle
the
journey
would
end
at
a
barred
iron
door
within
would
be
a
fetid
reeking
chamber
lit
only
by
two
or
three
tiny
chinks
in
the
masonry
and
with
the
bare
rock
for
the
floor
here
is
baron
conon
prison
he
is
counted
a
merciful
seigneur
yet
he
thinks
nothing
of
thrusting
genuine
offenders
therein
and
keeping
them
for
weeks
if
not
months
before
releasing
or
hanging
lucky
if
maître
denis
the
turnkey
remembers
to
bring
down
a
coarse
loaf
each
day
and
if
the
rats
do
not
devour
the
prisoners
toes
but
we
shall
consider
all
such
nice
matters
later
it
is
alleged
that
from
these
lower
vaults
there
is
an
underground
passage
leading
from
the
castle
to
a
secret
sallyport
at
the
foot
of
the
precipice
by
the
rapide
if
a
passage
exists
however
it
is
known
only
to
conon
and
a
very
few
trusted
retainers
but
not
all
such
stories
are
false
many
castles
have
such
secret
passages
and
at
coucy
they
are
quietly
planning
to
introduce
a
rather
elaborate
system
of
the
same
quite
possibly
aliquis
possesses
something
of
this
nature
far
pleasanter
is
it
now
to
ascend
from
the
main
hall
through
a
couple
of
stages
of
upper
and
airier
chambers
now
used
as
apartments
by
part
of
the
castle
folk
until
by
a
dizzy
ladder
we
reach
the
summit
of
the
donjon
itself
here
on
one
edge
of
the
broad
platform
is
a
little
round
turret
carrying
us
still
higher
from
the
turret
flutters
the
orange
banner
of
aliquis
with
some
kind
of
a
black
dragon
in
memory
possibly
of
the
viking
raid
broidered
upon
it
and
the
arrogant
legend
of
the
noble
family
rather
break
than
bend
to
lower
this
banner
were
a
horrid
disgrace
never
is
it
to
be
struck
unless
the
castle
surrenders
when
it
will
be
sadly
flung
into
the
moat
under
the
flagstaff
is
a
stout
projecting
beam
rigged
with
a
pulley
here
is
a
gibbet
in
case
the
baron
wishes
to
hang
offenders
as
a
warning
for
the
countryside
fortunately
however
adela
has
a
dislike
to
seeing
the
corpses
dangling
and
has
persuaded
conon
to
order
his
recent
hangings
at
the
ordinary
gallows
across
the
claire
by
the
village
on
the
flag
turret
is
always
a
watchman
day
or
night
some
peasant
must
take
his
turn
and
even
in
peace
he
has
no
sinecure
he
must
blow
on
his
great
horn
at
sunrise
at
cover
fire
at
night
when
the
baron
hunt
rides
out
and
returns
and
again
when
a
strange
retinue
approaches
the
gate
the
whole
wide
countryside
spreads
in
a
delightful
panorama
below
him
at
present
but
on
winter
nights
when
every
blast
is
howling
around
the
donjon
the
task
is
less
grateful
no
wonder
that
peasants
impressed
for
this
service
complain
that
watchmen
have
the
lot
of
the
damned
so
back
through
the
donjon
and
again
to
the
castle
court
the
donjon
is
purely
military
in
times
of
peace
it
is
a
mere
storehouse
prison
and
supplementary
barrack
for
the
seigneur
people
in
war
it
is
the
last
position
where
the
garrison
can
stand
desperately
at
bay
a
hundred
years
earlier
adela
and
her
alienor
would
have
lived
out
most
of
their
days
in
the
cheerless
dark
chambers
directly
above
the
main
hall
now
they
are
more
fortunate
they
dwell
in
the
elegant
gothic
arched
sidenote
great
hall
of
the
palais
the
consists
of
a
long
somewhat
narrow
building
thrusting
out
into
the
inner
court
and
of
other
structures
resting
against
the
western
curtain
wall
on
one
side
but
with
their
larger
inner
windows
looking
also
into
the
court
the
rooms
are
high
with
enormous
fireplaces
where
great
logs
can
warm
the
apartments
in
winter
the
ceilings
are
ribbed
and
vaulted
like
a
church
and
some
of
the
masonry
is
beautifully
carved
where
the
bare
walls
are
exposed
they
are
often
covered
with
a
stucco
on
which
are
sketched
fresco
scenes
somewhat
after
the
style
of
stiff
byzantine
paintings
or
the
famous
tapestry
of
queen
mathilde
at
bayeux
all
the
tints
are
flat
red
yellow
or
brown
without
perspective
or
fine
lines
and
in
a
kind
of
little
touches
of
green
violet
and
blue
relieve
the
bareness
and
despite
many
awkward
outlines
and
other
limitations
many
of
the
scenes
are
spirited
as
well
as
highly
decorative
some
of
the
pictures
are
religious
we
notice
christ
on
the
cross
between
the
synagogue
and
the
new
law
a
last
judgment
an
episode
in
the
life
of
aliquis
himself
also
many
secular
pictures
based
often
on
the
epics
thus
from
the
song
of
roland
there
is
the
tearing
by
wild
horses
of
the
traitor
ganelon
the
windows
in
this
betray
the
luxury
of
the
owner
they
are
not
closed
by
wooden
shutters
as
are
most
other
apertures
in
the
castle
they
are
of
glass
with
very
small
panes
set
in
lead
the
panes
in
the
smaller
rooms
are
uncolored
although
hardly
of
transparent
whiteness
but
in
the
huge
dining
hall
they
are
richly
colored
as
in
a
church
giving
a
galaxy
of
patron
saints
martin
the
warrior
saint
of
france
and
of
knights
and
paladins
from
charlemagne
and
king
artus
down
gazing
benignantly
upon
the
feasters
below
this
new
hall
is
of
course
the
finest
apartment
in
the
castle
here
amid
and
deeply
carved
the
baron
household
sits
down
to
dinner
it
is
however
more
than
a
mere
dining
room
great
feudal
ceremonies
such
as
the

nearly
all
the
castle
folk

resort

sit
on
the
dais
upon
his
canopied
chair
everybody
else
will
wedge
in
as
closely
as
possible
and
after
infinite
chatter
jesting
dice
playing
and
uproar
the
jongleurs
will
take
station
near
the
fireplace
do
their
tricks
sing
songs
or
recite
romances
the
hall
is
in
short
the
focus
of
the
peaceful
life
of
the
castle
there
are
other
rooms
in
the
but
considering
the
number
of
people
who
have
to
live
therein
they
seem
rather
few
there
is
little
real
privacy
in
aliquis
the
baron
has
a
special
closet
indeed
where
he
can
retire
and
hope
that
he
is
not
overheard
but
the
great
chamber
for
himself
and
the
baroness
is
ordinarily
full
of
servitors
next
to
the
chamber
is
a
second
room
where
the
baron
sons
sleep
while
they
are
little
and
where
honored
guests
can
be
lodged
conon
brother
and
sister
have
each
a
large
apartment
but
there
seems
a
singular
lack
of
anterooms
boudoirs
and
other
retiring
rooms
it
is
perfectly
good
manners
to
ask
noble
guests
to
share
the
same
rooms
with
the
family
and
a
couple
of
the
baroness
maids
will
sleep
on
pallets
within
her
chamber
with
the
baron
favorite
squire
just
outside
the
door
as
for
the
lesser
folk
at
night
they
often
stretch
unceremoniously
on
the
tables
or
even
on
the
floor
in
the
main
hall
the
possession
of
a
strictly
private
room
is
indeed
a
decided
luxury
even
a
great
noble
is
often
able
to
go
without

these

for

at

is
an
enormous
construction
thrusting
far
into
the
room

long
logs
on
high
andirons
can
heat
the
stonework
so
it
will
glow
furiously
for

their

into

roaming

can
not

the
central
object
of
the
chamber
is
the
bed
to
have
a
fine
bed
for
the

is
the
ambition
of
every
feudal
household
it

the

a

of

its
intricately
carved

into
the

the
whole
structure
is
set
upon
a
platform
when
the
baron
and

have
retired
their
attendants
will
pull
the
thick
curtains
and
practically
inclose
them
in
their

the
curtains
cut
off

but
that
is
no
disadvantage
because
every

a

tall
wax
candle
stands
near

is
allowed
to
burn
all
night
this
keeps
away
pixies
and
the

and
makes
things
generally
more
cheerful
for
christians
the

are
similarly
furnished

with
less
magnificence
of
course
in
the

are
so
poor
that
only
rarely
when
there
is
a
great
festival
or
imperative
work
to
be
performed
do
persons
remain
about
many
hours
after
sunset
in

the
castle
folks
possibly
spend
nearly
half
of
their
entire
time
in
bed
in
summer
thanks
to
the
long
evenings
they
would
hardly
get
sufficient
sleep
save
for
a

actually

mount
their
high

then
descend
to
order
the
washing

to
be
blown

hear
too
of
ladies
who
rise
at
dusk
have
chaplains
chant
matins
while
they
are
throwing
on
some
clothes
then
go
to
the
regular
chapel

next
complete
their
toilet
and
take
a
walk
in
their

there
are
indeed

in

backslidings
follow
only
a
deplorable

neither
indefatigable

nor
among
the
slothful

are
seldom

is
already

not

only
the
clothing

curiously
enough
he

age
is
one

great
contradictions
in
matters
of
cleanliness
baron
conon
washes
his
face

hands
carefully
and
frequently
he
also
takes
complete
baths
pretty
often
using
large
wooden
tubs
filled
with
hot
perfumed
water
personally
he
seems
an
extraordinarily
neat
man
and
so
are
all
the
people
but
the
age
has
never
heard
of
polluted
wells
and
other
breeding
spots
for
malignant
fevers
flies
are
harmless
annoyances

infamies
had
been

gross
irregularity
in

there

it

the

really
be
not
a
little

of
the
excitement

strenuous
preparation

come
with

the

this

hardly
practicable
in

not
commonly
reckoned
a
regular
sport
in

neither
can

hold

his

dispense
justice

at

ordinarily
reserve
themselves
for

secret
hankering
for

is
therefore
somewhat
explicable
if
this
is
a
fortunate
day
however
the
horn
on
the
turret
will
blow
and
then
the
gong
at
the

will
reverberate
a

arrived
nothing
can
ordinarily
be
more
welcome
in
castle
communities
little
isolated
fractions
of
humanity
as
they
are
with
the
remainder
of
the
world
seemingly
at
an
extreme
distance
the

a
chance
to
hear

of
the
chances
of

of

nay
possibly
of

of
another
brave

that
which

unknightly
indeed
is
the
seigneur
who
does
not
offer
profuse
hospitality
to
a
noble
visitor
and
any
priest
monk
or
merchant
will
be
given
a
decent
though
less
ceremonious
welcome
no
wonder
the
inns
everywhere
are
so
bad
when
the
lords
of
so
many
castles
grow
actually
angry
if
a
traveler
will
not
tarry

for
days
sidenote
hospitality
to
guests
there
are
stories
of
knights
who
have
deliberately
caused
the
roads
to
be
diverted
to
compel
travelers
to
come
close
to
their
castles
where
they
can
be
politely
waylaid
and
compelled
to
linger
conon
is
not
so
absurd
but
if
a
guest
of
noble
rank
approaches
the
castle
all
the
ordinary
routine
ceases
at
the
outer
gate
the
strangers
are
met
by
william
the
first
squire
if
he
reports
that
their
chief
is
a

the
visitors
have
the
gates
unbarred
before

they
ride
straight
over
both
drawbridges
to
the
inner
court
conon
himself
leads
in
the
horse
of
his
chief
guest
and
when
the
visiting
nobleman
dismounts
he
usually
kisses
him
upon
mouth
and
chin
although
if
the
strange
knight
is
an
elderly
man
or
of
very
exalted
rank
he
shows
his
respect
by
kissing
only
his
shoulders
adela
and
her
maidens
at
once
conduct
the
visitors
to
a
chamber
where
the
best
feather
beds
are
piled
high
in
their
honor
and
next
skillfully
take
off
their
armor
bathe
their
feet
and
even
assist
them
to
don
loose
clean
clothes
a
kind
of
wrapper
very
pleasant
for
indoor
wear
meantime
their
horses
are
being
stabled
and
given
every
attention
only
after
the
visitors
are
dressed
refreshed
bathed
and
perhaps
fed
will
conon
courteously
inquire
for
how
long
he
is
to
enjoy
their
company
and
whether
they
are
making
aliquis
merely
a
stopping
point
or
have
come
to
him
on
business
guests
do
not
receive
such
ceremony
unless
they
are
high
churchmen
bishops
abbots
and
their
direct
subordinates
but
even
a
poor
villein
if
he
appears
on
a
fit
errand
is
welcome
to
a
solid
meal
and
a
bed
on
the
rushes
in
one
of
the
halls
a
jongleur
is
always
received
heartily
and
entertained
with
the
best
the
payment
will
be
in
songs
and
tricks
after
supper
on
most
feast
days

of

will
say
to
everyone

please
there
will
be
simply
enormous
gorging
and
guzzling
at
the
baron
expense
yet
if
there
are
no
outside
guests
the
baron
is
far
from
being
an
idle
man
since
he
has
been
stirring
at
he
is
able
to
accomplish
a
great
deal
during
the
morning
all
the
stables
must
be
inspected
directions
are
given
about
a
brood
mare
the
noisy
falcon
house
is
surveyed
various
stewards
bailiffs
and
provosts
come
in
with
reports
about
the
peasants
the
baron
farms
and
especially
the
contention
with
a
neighboring
seigneur
woodcutters
about
the
right
to
take
timber
in
a
disputed
forest
land
a
case
calling
for
major
diplomacy
to
avoid
a
brisk
private
war
then
too
although
this
is
not
a
court
day
the
baron
as
the
dispenser
of
justice
has
to
order
two
brawling
peasants
to
be
clapped
in
the
stocks
until
sundown
and
to
direct
that
an
lad
who
had
been
caught
in
an
honest
villein
corn
bin
shall
have
his
ears
cropped
off
the
castle
is
in
fact
an
economic
unit
all
by
itself
if
the
baron
is
idle
or
preoccupied
he
leaves
its
management
to
deputies
but
a
good
seigneur
knows
about
everything
the
estate
has
its
own
corn
lands
and
pasture
its
stacks
of
hay
its
granaries
and
storehouses
its
mills
cattle
byres
slaughter
houses
and
salting
sheds
practically
every
scrap
of
food
actually
needed
in
the
castle
is
grown
locally
the
innumerable
women
and
varlets
wear
coarse
woolen
cloth
made
from
wool
raised
sheared
carded
spun
and
woven
on
the
seigneury
the
ordinary
weapons
and
tools
required
in
war
are
made
at
the
smithy
in
the
bailey
the
result
is
that
the
castle
people
do
very
little
buying
and
selling
conon
has
a
certain
income
in
silver
deniers
but
except
for
the
important
sums
he
is
laying
by
for
a
tournament
his
sister
marriage
perhaps
a
private
war
and
other
like
occasions
he
spends
it
almost
entirely
on
the
finer
articles
of
clothing
for
superior
weapons
for
cookery
spices
and
for
a
few
such
luxuries
as
foreign
wines
these
can
be
bought
from
visiting
packmen
or
by
a
visit
to
pontdebois
during
the
fair
seasons
aliquis
therefore
presents
what
is
to
us
a
curious
spectacle
a
sizable
community
wherein
many
of
its
members
seldom
handle
that
thing
called
money
from
one
month
to
another
sidenote
comradery
and
organization
of
castle
folk
conon
on
many
mornings
is
thus
kept
busy
adjusting
petty
matters
concerning
the
estate
the
seigneur
is
the
center
the
disposing
power
for
the
whole
seigneury
but
he
is
not
the
despot
the
castle
is
one
huge
family
and
shares
its
joys
and
troubles
together
the
upper
servitors
hold
their
position
by
a
kind
of
hereditary
right
guilbert
who
presides
over
the
smithy
is
son
of
the
smith
before
him
in
similar
case
are
the
chief
cook
the
master
huntsman
and
many
others
even
the
dubious
post
of
baronial
executioner
is
transmitted
by
a
kind
of
hereditary
prerogative
for
conon
to
dismiss
any
of
these
subordinates
save
for
very
obvious
reasons
would
be
resented
by
all
their
fellows
and
produce
a
passive
rebellion
unwelcome
to
the
most
arbitrary
seigneur
even
tyrannous
baron
garnier
had
to
wait
a
suitable
opportunity
ere
changing
an
unwelcome
servitor
every
person
has
his
own
little
sphere
of
influence
and
privilege
the
successful
baron
respects
all
these
rights
and
handles
each
inferior
tactfully
the
result
is
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
comradery
and
plain
speaking
the
baron
and
baroness
must
listen
to
flat
contradictions
every
day
you
are
absolutely
wrong
messire
says
herbert
the
cowherd
when
conon
directs
him
to
wean
certain
calves
i
shall
execute
no
such
order
and
the
baron
who
would
have
fought
a
mortal
duel
with
a
fellow
noble
ere
accepting
such
language
wisely
acquiesces
with
a
laugh
herbert
is
his
man
and
as
such
has
his
own
sphere
of
action
and
besides
herbert
and
all
his
fellows
will
fight
for
their
seigneur
to
the
last
drop
of
their
blood
and
obey
all
strictly
military
orders
with
touching
fidelity
indeed
the
aliquis
people
are
somewhat
like
children
they
are
often
angry
turbulent
obstinate
contentious
even
exchanging
cuffs
and
blows
the
women
are
almost
as
passionate
as
the
men
but
tempers
cool
with
equal
rapidity
two
varlets
who
almost
drew
knives
this
morning
will
be
communing
like
twin
brothers
this
afternoon
furthermore
despite
much
apparent
friction
the
people
who
sleep
behind
the
walls
of
aliquis
are
fairly
well
organized
first
of
all
the
baron
has
his
three
squires
youths
of
friendly
baronial
families
who
are
being
nourished
by
conon
preparatory
to
knighthood
and
whose
education
will
be
described
later
they
are
of
course
noble
and
are
looking
forward
to
ruling
their
own
castles
noble
too
is
sire
eustace
the
seneschal
the
baron
old
companion
in
arms
who
carries
the
great
gonfalon
of
aliquis
into
battle
and
who
in
peace
times
is
chief
factotum
and
superintendent
of
almost
everything
about
the
fief
the
marshal
who
has
charge
of
the
stables
is
also
the
son
of
a
good
house
and
the
chamberlain
who
has
oversight
over
all
that
interior
economy
which
does
not
pertain
to
food
drink
and
mealtimes
is
an
elderly
childless
knight
who
became
lamed
in
the
service
of
the
baron
father
and
who
really
holds
an
honorable
sinecure
there
are
besides
these
four
other
petty
nobles
whose
estates
are
so
small
that
they
find
it
pleasantest
to
live
at
aliquis
ride
in
the
baron
hunts
and
command
his
men
at
arms
the
remainder
of
the
castle
servants
are
indeed
but
there
is
nothing
dishonorable
in
personal
service
provided
you
serve
a
lord
higher
than
yourself
conon
would
feel
complimented
if
on
a
visit
to
paris
he
were
asked
to
carry
a
great
pasty
and
set
it
before
the
queen
the
importance
of
a
baron
is
somewhat
gauged
by
the
number
of
his
squires
and
noble
servitors
many
a
poor
sire
has
to
put
up
with
only
one
squire
and
perhaps
a
seneschal
as
for
conon
and
adela
they
have
a
cherished
ambition
that
in
their
sons
day
at
least
the
aliquis
butler
cellarer
dispenser
and
even
the
master
falconer
should
be
of
gentle
blood
also
but
that
would
be
putting
their
household
practically
on
an
equality
with
the
duke
sidenote
dinner
supper
and
nightfall
when
dinnertime
comes
there
will
be
a
great
rush
for
the
hall
but
the
ceremonies
of
the
table
will
be
told
later
of
course
on
common
days
one
will
not
expect
a
banquet
only
one
or
two
plates
of
meat
some
fish
a
few
vegetables
bread
and
common
wine
but
all
in
abundance
hunger
seldom
troubles
aliquis
if
the
weather
is
fine
very
likely
dinner
and
supper
will
be
served
in
the
garden
outside
the
barbican
under
pleasant
shade
trees
close
to
the
purling
rapide
there
will
be
long
tables
covered
with
linen
dyed
with
montpellier
scarlet
the
honored
guests
will
have
cushioned
benches
the
remainder
will
sit
on
almost
anything
supper
may
be
either
in
the
hall
or
in
the
garden
according
to
circumstances
it
is
a
long
time
between
dinner
and
supper
and
appetites
are
again
keen
after
supper
if
by
the
presence
of
jongleurs
there
are
excuses
for
torches
and
music
the
castle
folk
join
in
diversions
or
even
in
dancing
until
a
large
silver
cup
is
solemnly
handed
to
the
baron
he
drinks
deeply
all
his
guests
are
similarly
served
then
he
rises
and
the
company
goes
to
bed
if
there
are
honored
visitors
conon
will
escort
them
to
their
chambers
himself
and
take
another
sup
of
wine
with
them
ere
parting
for
the
night
the
seneschal
meantime
makes
a
careful
round
of
the
walls
to
satisfy
himself
that
the
outer
drawbridge
is
raised
the
sentries
posted
and
that
everything
is
safe
then
he
will
transmit
the
ponderous
keys
to
be
taken
to
the
baron
room
till
dawn
the
seigneur
is
undressed
by
his
squires
and
reposes
under
an
avalanche
of
feather
beds
thick
enough
to
provide
a
vapor
bath
soon
all
the
lights
are
extinguished
throughout
the
whole
black
mass
of
the
castle
save
only
the
tall
taper
in
the
master
apartment
so
the
castle
sleeps
through
the
darkness
unbroken
save
for
the
occasional
all
is
well
from
the
yawning
sentry
on
the
turret
until
the
thrushes
and
blackbirds
begin
their
noise
in
the
garden
and
in
the
trees
by
the
rivers
then
again
aliquis
resumes
its
daytime
business
footnotes
hospitality
sometimes
went
to
such
a
point
that
we
are
told
the
ladies
of
the
castle
assisted
a
visiting
knight
to
take
a
complete
bath
a
service
quite
innocently
rendered
and
accepted
similar
customs
of
course
obtained
among
the
greeks
of

see

even
when
sums
of

are

may

that
often

in

are
really
in

iv
games
and
diversions
falconry
and
hunting
the
garden
if
baron
conon
has
been
fortunate
enough
to
receive
a
noble
guest
almost
the
first
question
is
how
to
divert
the
stranger
the
inevitable
program
will
be
to
constrain
the
visitor
to
tarry
at
least
long
enough
to
cast
hawks
or
to
chase
down
a
deer
if
that
is
not
possible
at
least
he
will
be
courteously
urged
to
attempt
some
game
and
it
will
be
most
ungentle
of
him
to
refuse
indoor
games
are
in
great
demand
where
bad
weather
often
makes
open
sports
impossible
and
where
bookish
diversions
are
limited
the
baron
frequently
plays
with
his
own
family
when
there
are
no
outside
guests
and
all
the
household
are
more
or
less
expert
to
understand
them
is
part
of
a
gentle
education
for
both
sexes
indeed
there
is
no
better
way
for
a
noble
dame
and
a
cavalier
to
begin
a
romance
than
to
sit
through
a
long
afternoon
studying
one
another
faces
no
less
than
the
gaming
table
some
of
these
diversions
are
decidedly
like
those
of
a
later
age
for
example
if
all
present
are
reasonably
literate
they
can
play
roll
burlesque
verses
some
suitable
for
men
some
for
women
and
all
often
deplorably
coarse
are
written
on
slips
of
parchment
wound
in
a
roll
on
each
slip
is
a
string
with
some
sign
showing
for
which
sex
it
is
intended
everybody
has
to
draw
a
roll
then
open
and
read
it
aloud
to
the
mirthful
company
the
verses
are
supposed
to
show
the
character
of
the
person
drawing
the
same
also
even
folk
are
not
above
run
around
games
which
are
later
reserved
for
children
high
barons
play
buff
seigneurs
and
dames
sometimes
join
in
the
undignified
hot
cockles
a
blindfolded
player
kneels
with
his
face
on
the
knee
of
another
and
with
his
hands
held
out
behind
him
other
players
in
turn
strike
him
on
the
hand
and
he
tries
to
guess
who
has
hit
him
if
he
is
correct
the
person
last
striking
takes
his
place
of
course
a
large
part
of
the
sport
is
to
deliver
very
shrewd
blows
the
fact
that
such
a
game
can
be
in
vogue
shows
again
that
even
the
high
and
mighty
are
often
like
children
abounding
in
animal
spirits
these
games
conon
will
not
press
upon
his
guests
he
will
urge
on
them
backgammon
checkers
chess
or
if
they
seem
young
and
secular
perhaps
dice
backgammon
is
called
tables
it
is
a
combination
of
dice
playing
plus
the
motion
of
pieces
on
a
board
which
goes
back
to
roman
times
the
boards
and
methods
of
play
are
so
like
those
of
a
later
age
that
one
need
not
comment
thereon
backgammon
is
a
popular
diversion
but
hardly
more
so
than
checkers
anglice
draughts
known
in
france
as
dames
here
also
is
a
game
that
hardly
changes
essentially
from
age
to
age
the
checkermen
at
aliquis
are
square
not
round
otherwise
no
explanation
is
needed
sidenote
backgammon
checkers
and
dice
what
men
like
conon
really
enjoy
however
are
games
of
dice
nevertheless
since
the
church
has
often
censured
these
cubes
of
ivory
he
and
his
baroness
do
not
dare
to
use
them
too
often
besides
they
realize
the
havoc
often
wrought
among
the
young
by
dice
throwing
and
wish
to
keep
their
own
sons
from
temptation
in
parts
of
france
there
are
laws
reading
dice

not
be
made
in
this
dominion
and
those
using
them
shall
be
looked
upon
as
suspicious
characters
all
such
enactments
are
usually
dead
letters
and
a
high
justiciar
can
ordinarily
punish
merely
the
manufacture
and
use
of
loaded
dice
although
church
prelates
rail
vigorously
their
complaints
are
not
merely
that
games
of
chance
are
sinful
but
that
the
blasphemies
constantly
uttered
by
losing
dice
players
form
a
means
of
populating
hell
dice
playing
assuredly
is
extremely
common
it
is
even
impiously
called
the
game
of
god
because
the
regulation
of
chance
belongs
to
providence
did
not
the
holy

wicked

quiet

vainly
does

swearing

no

this
royal
game
has
doubtless
come
from
the
orient
caliphs
of

infidels
have
long
since
boasted
their
skill
in
taking
rooks
and
pawns
but
in
western
lands
about
the
first
record
comes
from
the
time
of
pope
alexander
ii
to
whom
complaint
was
made
that
a
bishop
of
florence
was
spending
his
evenings
in
the
vanity
of
chess
playing
the
bishop
enemies
alleged
that
this
was
forbidden
by
the
canons
prohibiting
dice
but
the
bishop
retorted
that
dice
and
chess
were
entirely
different
things
the
first
sinful
the
second
a
most
honorable
exercise
for
christians
the
pope
tactfully
refrained
from
pressing
the
matter
nevertheless
austere
churchmen
regarded
the
game
as
worldly
and
impetuous
religious
reformers
insisted
on
confounding
it
with
games
of
chance
it
was
only
in
that
a
council
of
paris
forbade
french
clerics
to
play
chess
just
as
it
for
about
the
thousandth
time
forbade
dice
despite
which
fact
the
bishop
of
pontdebois
spent
a
whole
afternoon
over
the
chessboard
the
last
time
he
visited
the
castle
and
could
test
his
skill
on
the
baron
as
for
the
nobility
no
one
thinks
of
refusing
to
play

naturally
it
is
the
older
knights
who
have
the
patience
for
long
contests
according
to
the
of
after
charlemagne
host
had
taken
cordova
the
emperor
and
all
his
knights
rested
themselves
in
a
shady
garden
the
more
sedate
leaders
immediately
played
chess
although
the
younger
champions
selected
the
more
exciting
backgammon
the
chessmen
are
often
made
of
whalebone

imported
from
scandinavia

are

since
moslems
despise
women

the
truth
is
that
both

are
carried
on

we

that

hunt
will
start
at
dawn
and
it
will
take
much
of
the
forenoon
to
reach
the
forest
where
the
boar
has
been
discovered
then
recites
a
jongleur
will
begin
the
baying
and
the
yelping
of
dogs
they
are
unleashed
they
bound
through
the
thicket
and
find
the
tracks
where
the
boar
has
dug
and
rooted
for
worms
one
of
the
keepers
then
unleashes
blanchart
the
baron
best
bloodhound
conon
pats
his
head
and
they
put
him
on
the
track
the
hound
soon
discovers
the
boar
lair
it
is
a
narrow
place
between
the
trunks
of
two
uprooted
oaks
near
a
spring
when
the
boar
hears
the
baying
of
the
hound
he
stands
erect
spreads
his
enormous
feet
and
disdaining
flight
wheels
around
until
judging
himself
within
reaching
distance
of
the
good
hound
he
seizes
it
and
fells
it
dead
by
his
side
the
baron
would
not
have
given
blanchart
for
one
hundred
deniers
not
hearing
his
barking
he
runs
up
sword
in
hand
but
he
is
too
late
the
boar
is
gone
after
that
there
is
nothing
for
it
except
to
keep
up
the
chase
relentlessly
until
evening
with
the
whole
company
gradually
scattering
through
the
forest
until
conon
at
last
overtakes
the
chase
but
the
baron
is
now
alone
save
for
a
few
dogs
the
boar
has
finally
come
to
bay
in
front
of
a
thicket
he
begins
by
refreshing
himself
in
a
pool
then
raising
his
brows
rolling
his
eyes
and
snorting
he
bares
his
tusks
and
dashes
upon
the
dogs
and
rips
them
open
or
tears
them
to
pieces
one
after
another
all
except
three
of
the
best
greyhounds
then
conon
arrives
and
first
of
all
he
sees
his
dogs
stretched
out
dead
son
of
a
sow
cries
he
is
you
that
have
disemboweled
my
dogs
have
separated
me
from
my
friends
and
have
brought
me
i
know
not
where
you
shall
die
he
leaps
from
his
steed
at
his
shout
the
boar
despite
bushes
and
ditches
leaps
upon
him
swift
as
an
arrow
conon
lets
him
come
straight
on
and
holding
the
boar
spear
straight
before
him
strikes
at
his
breast
the
point
pierces
the
heart
and
goes
out
at
the
shoulder
blade
mortally
wounded
the
boar
swerves
to
one
side
totters
and
falls
so
the
chase
ends
and
the
dogs
are
avenged
the
baron
has
to
blow
his
horn
many
times
ere
his
party
finds
him
luckily
the
boar
has
run
back
somewhat
toward
aliquis
they
are
therefore
able
to
get
home
in
noisy
triumph
that
night
and
all
the
castle
women
are
under
the
red
torches
outside
the
gate
to
oh
and
ah
at
the
boar

to
praise

while
a
young
prince
once
followed
a

was

one
important
part
of
the
aliquis
population
however
regards
all
hunting
parties
with
far
less
satisfaction
the
chase
often
goes
straight
across
the
peasants
fields
with
twenty
horses
beating
down
the
newly
seeded
ground
or
even
the
standing
crops
this
is
the
absolute
privilege
and
any
protest
is
treasonable
the
villeins
have
not
simply
to
submit
to
this
but
if
deer
nibble
or
boars
root
upon
their
fields
they
can
merely
try
to
scare
the
ravagers
off
their
lord

use

kept
conveniently
in

did
not

two
great

the

garden
adela
has
taken
great
pains
with
her
garden
which
fell
into
a
bad
condition
during

day
she
often
councils
with
brother
sebastian
at
the
abbey
a
real
botanist
with
a
true
love
of
plants
and
flowers
one
side
of
the
beds
is
adorned
with
roses
lilies
and
marigolds
on
the
other
grow
useful
herbs
such
as
lettuce
cresses
mint

hyssop
sage
coriander
and
fennel
with
these
too
are
also

daffodils
and
acanthus
plants
while
a
vegetable
garden
supplies
the
castle
with
cucumbers
beets
mustard
and
wormwood
the
fruit
trees
yield
a
sizable
crop
of
apples
quinces
peaches
and
pears
there
is
a
kind
of
in
which
the
baroness
has
tried
to
raise
figs
but
with
no
great
success
but
of
course
there
is
no
difficulty
in
maturing
grapes
and
cherries
indeed
cherry
festivals
are
among
the
most
familiar
and
delightful
holidays
in
all
this
part
of
france
life
say
monkish
writers
warning
the
thoughtless
though
perhaps
pleasant
is
transitory
as
is
a
cherry
fair
crooked
heman
the
hunchbacked
gardener
has
considerable
skill
even
without
the
teachings
of
brother
sebastian
he
practices
grafting
successfully
although
his
theories
on
the
subject
are
absurd
he
is
trying
to
develop
a
new
kind
of
plum
and
is
tenderly
raising
some
of
the
new
agony
pears
a
bitter
variety
for
pickling
true
he
believes
that
cherries
can
grow
without
stones
if
you
have
the
right
recipe
and
that
peach
trees
will
bear
pomegranates
if
only
you
can
sprinkle
them
with
enough
goats
milk
this
does
not
prevent
large
practical
results
his
tools
are
simple
an
ax
a
spade
a
grafting
knife
and
a
pruning
hook
but
thanks
to
the
unlimited
number
of
peasant
clowns
which
the
baroness
can
put
at
his
disposal
he
keeps
the
garden
and
orchard
in
admirable
order
heman
office
is
the
more
important
because
the
garden
does
not
exist
solely
as
a
pleasure
spot
or
for
its
fruits
and
vegetables
flowers
are
in
constant
demand
whenever
obtainable
for
garlands
and
chaplets
even
as
with
the
greeks
no
feast
is
complete
without
them
wild
flowers
are
in
favor
and
many
a
time
adela
maids
are
sent
out
to
gather
and
wreathe
woodbine
or
hawthorn
but
of
course
such
a
supply
is
irregular
on
every
social
occasion
from
early
spring
to
the
edge
of
winter
the
castle
garden
must
therefore
supply
its
garlands
it
is
accordingly

of
the
essential
working
units
of

they

a

exercise
in

both
a
complexion

adela
at

is
fortunate
she
is
not
troubled
by
worse
things
than
hortatory
friends
champions
of
equality
of
sexes
from
a
later
age
can
become
horrified
over
the
legal
status
of
women
in
the
feudal
centuries
females
can
never
bear
arms
they
must
remain
perpetually
as
minors
before
the
law
even
a
great
heiress
will
be
under
severe
pressure
to
take
a
husband
who
will
perform
the
military
duties
of
her
fief
as
soon
as
possible
if
a
baron
dies
leaving
only
a
young
daughter
the
suzerain
can
complain
that
he
has
been
injured
in
one
of
his
most
important
rights
his
claim
to
armed
service
from
the
fief
holder
where
now
is
the
vassal
to
follow
his
banner
perhaps
a
decent
suzerain
will
wait
until
the
heiress
is
twelve
then
he
will
give
her
to
some
battleworthy
follower
she
will
not
have
any
real
choice
even
if
the
bridegroom
is
old
ugly
and
brutal
on
the
other
hand
many
a
fatherless
girl
becomes
terribly
anxious
to
be
married
only
married
women
have
a
fixed
status
in
feudal
society
only
a
husband
can
keep
an
heiress
lands
from
shameless
plunder
there
is
the
familiar
story
of
a
young
noblewoman
who
went
straight
before
the
king
and
said
my
father
has
been
dead
two
months
i
demand
of
you
a
husband
she
never
dreamed
of
suggesting
any
particular
husband
was
the
suzerain
business
but
to
leave
her
in
unprotected
celibacy
was
an
outrage
which
no
lord
had
a
right
to
inflict
upon
an
orphan
sidenote
position
of
women
in
castles
legally
and
morally
husbands
have
the
right
to
treat
their
wives
harshly
if
the
latter
provoke
them
every
girl
around
aliquis
knows
the
story
of
the
silly
wife
who
often
contradicted
her
husband
in
public
and
how
after
he
had
vainly
remonstrated
one
day
raised
his
fist
knocked
her
down
and
kicked
her
in
the
face
while
she
was
prostrate
and
so
broke
her
nose
the
story
conveys
the
plain
lesson
that
she
was
directly
to
blame
for
it
is
only
right
that
words
of
authority
should
belong
to
her
lord
and
the
wife
duty
requires
that
she
should
listen
in
peace
and
obedience
it
is
indeed
repeated
as
something
rather
exceptional
that
adela
has
recently
boasted
to
certain
relatives
my
husband
since
our
marriage
has
never
once
laid
hands
on
me
not
that
all
castellans
are
brutal
but
after
all
men
will
be
men
lose
their
tempers
and
treat
their
wives
accordingly
everybody
knows
the
scene
from
an
epic
poem
where
a
certain
king
is
angered
at
a
tactless
remark
by
his
queen
and
therefore
shows
his
anger
in
his
face
and
strikes
her
in
the
nose
so
hard
that
he
draws
four
drops
of
blood
at
which
the
lady
meekly
says
thanks
when
it
pleases
you
you
may
do
it
again
such
submissiveness
is
the
best
way
to
disarm
a
husband
anger
conon
has
been
mildly
ridiculed
among
his
fellow
knights
because
he
takes
counsel
with
his
wife
minstrels
like
to
make
fun
of
such
cavaliers
and
to
commend
the
baron
who
told
his
officious
spouse
woman
go
within
and
eat
and
drink
with
your
maids
busy
yourself
dyeing
silks
such
is
business
it
is
to
strike
with
the
sword
of
steel
of
course
many
knights
do
worse
things
than
to
tell
their
wives
not
to
meddle
and
if
not
obeyed
occasionally
knock
them
down
it
has
been
told
how
baron
garnier
imprisoned
his
unhappy
consort
this
was
harsh
but
not
exceptional
philip
augustus
the
reigning
king
kept
his
unlucky
bride
ingebord
of
denmark
long
years
in
captivity
notwithstanding
the
menaces
of
the
church
holding
her
tight
in
the
gloomy
tower
of
éstampes
where
she
complained
she
had
not
enough
either
to
eat
or
to
wear
many
nobles
sometimes
imitate
their
lord
thus
over
in
burgundy
gautier
of
salins
recently
threw
his
wife
into
prison
whence
however
she
contrived
to
escape
to
her
parents
in
any
case
when
for
the
sake
of
her
fiefs
a
girl
of
twelve
to
eighteen
is
wedded
to
a
husband
of
forty
or
fifty
all
kinds
of
unhappy
things
can
happen
the
devil
can
fill
the
poor
damsel
mind
with
love
for
a
handsome
squire
her
lord
may
neglect
her
scandalously
until
suddenly
he
finds
himself
required
to
avenge
his
honor
by
some
deed
of
startling
cruelty
such
things
make
the
kind
saints
weep
not
without
reason
does
conon
make
discreet
inquiries
concerning
a
certain
widower
knight
who
has
sought
alienor
hand
does
he
horsewhip
his
servants
save
for
good
cause
did
he
leave
his
last
wife
to
mope
about
the
hall
while
he
spent
his
months
riotously
at
the
king
court
nevertheless
the
chatelaines
and
baronesses
of
these
parts
are
not
always
meek
doves
at
the
mercy
of
their
husbands
are
they
not
sprung
themselves
from
a
domineering
stock
are
they
not
reared
around
a
castle
which
is
a
great
barrack
and
where
the
talk
is
ever
of
feuds
and
forays
horses
lances
and
armor
many
a
noble
lady
can
answer
her
husband
fist
with
a
rousing
box
on
the
ear
and
if
he
is
not
a
courageous
man
make
him
quail
and
surrender
before
her
passions
her
habits
are
likely
to
seem
very
masculine
if
she
can
quarrel
like
a
virago
she
can
also
prove
a
in
times
of
danger
a
knight
will
ride
away
to
the
wars
leaving
his
castle
under
the
command
of
his
wife
and
feel
certain
that
it
will
be
defended
to
the
inner
donjon
the
rough
men
at
arms
will
obey
her
orders
as
implicitly
as
her
husband
in
short
the
feudal
noblewoman
is
as
might
be
expected
a
compound
of
mortal
weaknesses
and
excellencies
but
all
of
these
qualities
are
somewhat
naïve
and
elemental
in
any
case
the
castle
women
can
not
complain
of
being
shut
up
in
a
harem
they
have
perfect
freedom
to
meet
strange
men
if
we
accept
the
epic
poems
when
noble
maidens
believe
a
visiting
knight
to
be
very
handsome
they
do
not
hesitate
to
tell
him
so
to
his
face
in
many
love
stories
the
first
advances
come
from
the
lady
and
not
infrequently
these
advances
are
rather
coldly
received
by
the
knight
your
average
cavalier
is
a
man
of
strong
passions
but
he
is
often
more
interested
in
war
and
the
chase
than
in
fair
maidens
he
is
seldom
a
philanderer
sidenote
grossness
of
castle
life
if
we
visited
the
castles
around
aliquis
and
listened
to
typical
jongleurs
tales
we
should
gather
abundant
material
for
monkish
preachments
noble
ladies
are
said
to
make
few
difficulties
about
inviting
male
visitors
to
their
chambers
to
sit
on
their
beds
while
they
are
still
within
the
same
or
entering
the
room
of
a
male
guest
and
sitting
on
bed
while
conversing
very
familiarly
women
often
meet
strangers
in
scandalously
insufficient
garments
ladies
also
talk
with
the
uttermost
freedom
to
men
quite
as
openly
as
young
men
will
talk
on
ticklish
matters
among
themselves
many
a
story
jesting
question
or
gab
which
is
utterly
coarse
not
to
say
worse
will
be
exchanged
in
mixed
company
young
women
are
seldom
well
chaperoned
in
place
of
the
duenna
there
is
the
waiting
woman
herself
apt
to
have
her
own
lover
and
ready
to
help
her
mistress
push
matters
with
hers
if
there
is
a
sensual
intrigue
all
criticism
ceases
if
there
is
at
the
end
a
formal
marriage
but
many
romances
according
to
the
current
stories
in
no
wise
end
in
marriages
a
wedding
is
by
no
means
the
standard
climax
even
to
a
happy
love
affair
the
monks
of
course
are
scandalized
at
less
harmful
things
than
these
they
assert
that
the
fair
sex
besides
being
sinful
coquettes
are
spendthrifts
ruining
their
husbands
by
their
own
extravagance
women
as
a
sex
are
inordinately
fond
of
false
hair
rouging
and
other
forms
of
giving
a
lie
to
the
faces
which
god
has
vouchsafed
as
for
controlling
them
brother
guyot
of
provins
wrote
in
despair
thus
the
wisest
are
astray
when
they
wish
to
judge
or
correct
a
woman
she
has
never
found
her
master
and
who
can
flatter
himself
that
he
knows
her
when
her
eyes
weep
her
heart
laughs
there
are
men
who
teach
astronomy
necromancy
geometry
law
medicine
and
music
but
i
have
never
known
a
person
who
was
not
a
fool
to
take
for
a
subject
of
study
all
the
above
seems
true
yet
when
due
allowances
are
made
the
number
of
noblewomen
who
lead
happy
honorable
lives
is
great
and
if
many
barons
are
unkind
to
their
wives
many
others
reckon
them
as
their
greatest
treasures
if
reasonable
care
has
been
taken
not
to
force
the
mating
of
obviously
uncongenial
couples
a
decent
respect
is
likely
to
result
even
after
a
marriage
arranged
wholly
by
outsiders
if
in
many
of
the
epics
sundry
fair
ladies
seem
unprudish
very
many
others
are
superlatively
faithful
devoted
to
their
husbands
foes
to
all
evil
thoughts
and
seducers
and
know
how
to
draw
the
line
very
sharply
between
those
familiar
attentions
which
courtesy
demands
and
those
where
real
sinfulness
begins
even
a
baron
who
will
curse
his
wife
roundly
and
switch
her
shoulders
treats
her
also
as
his
the
holder
of
his
pledge
to
whom
he
can
trust
his
honor
and
leave
the
command
of
his
castle

he

a

adela

alienor
husbands
and
wives
are
shut
up
together
in
a
castle
often
for
weary
months
and
a
clever
wife
can
easily
make
herself
indispensable
to
her
husband
and
then
rule
the
whole
barony
in

in
treatment
of
women
as
in
all
things
else
the
feudal
age
is
a
jumble
of
contradictions

the
best

honor
woman

what
in

about
the

to
which
they
can
not
devote
themselves
sometimes
they
have
even
to
replace

adela
is
grateful
that
she
has
not
had
to
imitate
the
great
countess
blanche
of

who
while

of

recently
in
conducted

into

harmless
coquetry

a

asset
for
the

the
barony
her
greatest
task
however
is
to
direct
the
perpetual
weaving

embroidering
and
sewing
of
the
castle
women
even
if
some
of
the
finer
cloth
is
imported
nearly
all
the
garments
must
be
made
up
in

the

must
set
their

as
the

must
furnish
to
his

the

seem
given
over
to
incessant
cutting

you
watch
the

education
of

françois
is
now
being
taken
in
hand
by
his
father
and
taught
many
things
needful
for
a
baron
son
to
know
before
he
is
sent
away
to
be
nourished
by
some
friendly
seigneur
he
has
no
sisters
but
his
aunt
alienor
is
just
emerging
from
the
usual
education
of
a
girl
of
family
if
there
had
been
a
local
nunnery
she
might
have
been
sent
to
the
convent
school
as
it
was
conon
took
in
the
daughter
of
a
petty
noble
a
kind
of
sister
under
minor
vows
who
was
half
teacher
half
attendant
this
good
soul
has
given
alienor
rather
more
of
bookish
learning
than
françois
will
probably
obtain
the
young
lady
has
learned
to
read
and
write
romain
north
french
and
at
least
to
read
latin
the
result
is
that
she
devours
every
romance
manuscript
which
she
can
borrow
or
can
persuade
her
brother
to
buy
she
has
been
taught
arithmetic
fairly
well
she
has
learned
the
names
of
the
chief
stars
and
constellations
and
the
legend
about
the
way
of
jacques
the
milky
way
she
has
picked
up
a
knowledge
of
healing
herbs
and
is
not
afraid
of
the
sight
of
blood
nor
does
she
flinch
when
binding
up
a
wound
warfare
and
tourneys
require
that
young
girls
should
become
expert
nurses
and
even
make
shift
to
set

course
she
can
ride
and
at

or

upon
her
dear
roan

can
keep
up
with
the
best
and
like
every
fortunate
maiden
in
france
her
lips
are
perpetually
light
with
songs
pious
or
secular
from
quaint
little
chants

besides
the

ave
and
paternoster
which
every
christian
child
must
memorize
as
soon
as
possible
her
brother
one
easter
gave
her
a
finely
illustrated
psalter
and
she
has
most
of
the
chants
by
heart
by
constant
attendance
at
mass
she
knows
practically
the
entire
service
and
understands
its
symbolism
she
has
plenty
of
quaint
little
superstitions
but
no
degrading
ones
at
bedtime
she
repeats
a
prayer
which
is
popular
with
all
the

of

thou

my
life
her
dolls
of
course
have
been
much
finer
and
have
been
retained
much
longer
than
those
of
françois
in
her
chamber
her
pet
falcon
is
seldom
lacking
from
his
perch
a
fact
which
does
not
add
to
cleanliness
she
has
also
a
caged
magpie
which
she
is
laboriously
teaching
to
talk
at
the
last
fair
she
longed
vainly
for
a
rare
eastern
parrot
but
has
consoled
herself
with
a
very
small
lap
dog
presented
by
a
friendly
vassal
cats
abound
in
the
bailey
but
they
are
not
pets
for
noblewomen
there
is
something
plebeian
about
them
old
crones
always
possess
black
cats
which
possibly
partake
of
the
devil
the
church
however
does
not
support
this
last
belief
because
in
most
nunneries
the
sisters
are
forbidden
to
keep
any
animals
except
cats
which
evidently
belong
less
to
this
world
than
dogs
the
companions
of
secular
warriors
there
is
one
thing
which
alienor
really
loves
even
better
than
riding
and
hawking
long
hard
the
mania
young
people
have
for
dancing
is
sinful
the
church
vainly
tries
to
restrain
it
preferably
alienor
would
dance
with
a
handsome
knight
or
squire
yet
if
these
lack
the
most
indifferent
music
and
company
will
suffice
the
truth
is
that
her
robust
vigorous
body
demands
a
violent
outlet
it
is
vain
for
the
graver
adela
to
tell
her
of
the
count
who
allowed
so
much
dancing
in
his
castle
that
finally
at
a
on
christmas
day
so
many
joined
the
revel
and
all
danced
so
violently
that
the
floor
of
his
great
hall
suddenly
collapsed
the
whole
company
were
flung
to
the
cellar
and
the
foolish
count
own
daughter
was
the
first
body
to
be
taken
out
at
the
time
of
the
great
church
festivals
of
course
comes
the
delight
of
the
mystery
plays
and
alienor
herself
has
participated
therein
once
as
an
angel
and
once
also
as
queen
esther
at
the
easter
play
arranged
at
pontdebois
by
the
cathedral
clergy
she
has
hopes
now
that
next
easter
she
can
be
herodias
daughter
which
is
surely
the
best
part
open
to
women
except
that
of
the
holy
virgin
herself
sidenote
castle
servants
while
adela
is
on
her
part
graciously
assisting
her
family
she
is
also
more
explicitly
directing
her
servants
she
need
not
reckon
the
lack
of
domestic
help
among
her
troubles
hundreds
of
young
men
and
women
from
the
peasants
are
only
too
glad
to
enter
service
in
return
for
a
straw
pallet
a
suit
of
clothes
yearly
and
a
seat
in
the
great
hall
after
the
regular
diners
have
risen
money
wages
need
hardly
be
considered
although
everybody
expects
a
few
obols
at
christmas
and
easter
the
importance
of
a
baron
is
partly
indicated
by
the
number
of
his
dependents
wearing
his
insignia
eating
his
bread
and
attending
him
and
his
lady
everywhere
conon
is
hardly
less
vain
than
his
peers
the
result
is
that
aliquis
has
twice
as
many
servitors
as
are
really
required
the
courtyards
swarm
with
busy
idlers
although
there
is
a
certain
organization
and
hierarchy
of
service
and
all
but
the
least
responsible
lads
and
damsels
enjoy
the
honor
of
having
at
least
inferior
whom
they
can
afflict
with
cuffings
and
snappish
orders
adela
commands
some
twenty
young
women
one
or
two
of
these
are
daughters
of
petty
nobles
and
entitled
to
a
certain
consideration

the
matter
of
clothes
a
feudal
wedding
inasmuch
as
from
time
immemorial
a
wedding
has
seemed
primarily
a
matter
of
clothes
what
better
place
than
this
wherein
to
consider
the
costumes
of
the
good
folk
of
aliquis
assuredly
the
scripture
warns
us
take
no
thought
saying
shall
we
be
clothed
but
that
admonition
so
adela
tells
the
abbot
was
doubtless
intended
only
for
the
holy
apostles
not
for
a
christian
woman
who
must
make
a
fair
showing
for
her
husband
in
the
face
of
heaven
knows
how
many
critical
baronesses
and
countesses
already
western
folk
have
made
that
great
change
in
their
general
style
of
costume
which
is
to
last
for
many
generations
later
the
greeks
and
romans
their
garments
all
of
them
were
forms
of
slightly
elaborated
shawls
fastened
with
fibulæ
or
buckles
but
devoid
of
buttons
even
as
late
as
frankish
times
the
garments
of
contemporaries
seemed
fairly
loose
after
the
antique
model
but
with
the
feudal
age
has
come
elaborately
made
clothing
which
must
be
and
securely
fastened
we
have
reached
the
epoch
of
the
shirt
the
stocking
and
even
of
objects
later
to
be
styled
trousers
perhaps
the
life
constantly
spent
in
the
saddle
requires
this
also
the
demand
for
garments
easily
worn
under
the
hauberks
the
great
coats
of
mail
the
great
transition
has
been
made
the
men
of
aliquis
wear
garments
strange
enough
to
another
epoch
but
without
those
sartorial
differences
which
will
separate
the
twentieth
century
from
the
age
of
nero
sidenote
materials
for
clothing
another
thing
to
observe
is
that
nearly
all
garments
are
still
made
of
wool
save
indeed
the
leathern
leggings
and
gauntlets
of
the
hunters
and
crude
garments
of
skins
for
the
peasants
cotton
and
silk
if
not
quite
unknown
have
been
rare
with
linen
not
very
common
the
woolen
fabrics
have
usually
been
coarse
home
spun
literally
made
up
in
the
castles
or
farmhouses
such
garments
are
warm
and
durable
but
they
are
prone
to
collect
dirt
hard
to
wash
and
very
irritating
to
the
skin
probably
it
is
the
general
use
of
woolen
clothing
along
with
the
fact
that
much
of
the
population
possesses
no
other
raiment
than
what
it
is
wearing
incessantly
every
day
which
accounts
for
the
number
of
skin
diseases
from
leprosy
downward
which
are
direfully
prevalent
matters
are
improving
however
more
flax
is
being
spun
up
into

of

their

all
this

comes

to

trenched

excuse

other

of
their
bargain
although
here
again
is
a
practice
which
the
church
treats
with
just
anger
the
church
does
not
formally
permit
divorce
but
it
can
not
thwart
many
of
the
currents
of
the
age
nobles
frequently
repudiate
their
wives
for
trivial
reasons
mere
ill
health
for
instance
and
often
the
women
take
the
initiative
there
are
worldly
bishops
who
will
give
their
help
toward
an
annulment
on
grounds
of
lack
of
inward
consent
again
if
a
very
desirable
marriage
with
a
cousin
comes
in
question
often
a
dispensation
can
be
obtained
from
the
same
complaisant
authorities
it
is
easy
to
become
cynical
if
you
study
how
easily
the
holy
bonds
of
matrimony
can
be
put
on
and
off
by
the
powerful
although
sometimes
a
great
pope
like
innocent
iii
will
teach
even
a
mighty
king
a
lesson
as
philip
augustus
learned
when
he
tried
to
repudiate
poor
ingeborg
of
denmark
if
a
maiden
has
a
father
a
competent
brother
or
an
uncle
she
is
lucky
otherwise
the
bestowal
of
her
hand
belongs
to
her
suzerain
this
right
to
bestow
heiresses
or
the
widows
of
vassals
on
faithful
retainers
is
one
of
the
most
precious
privileges
of
a
great
seigneur
many
a
knight
is
kept
loyal
by
the
hope
that
presently
his
lord
will
say
one
of
my
barons
is
dead
without
sons
i
will
give
you
his
fiefs
and
his
daughter
or
take
the
widow
of
the
late
sire
x
you
may
have
the
land
along
with
the
lady
under
feudal
usage
it
is
impossible
to
deprive
an
heiress
of
her
estates
directly
but
her
marriage
practically
gives
her
husband
the
ownership
of
the
property
no
wonder
the
duke
of
quelqueparte
is
anxious
to
see
whether
the
sickly
count
of
greve
is
about
to
die
and
leave
only
a
daughter
so
that
he
can
secure
the
desirable
allegiance
of
the
baron
of
saturnin
who
has
been
a
widower
now
these
six
months
yet
has
remained
still
uncomforted
just
in
hope
of
this
particular
happening
sidenote
scandalous
relationships
what
wonder
if
under
these
conditions
strange
romances
occur
if
the
lady
gives
her
love
and
kiss
to
some
young
knight
not
her
husband
if
south
country
troubadours
assert
that
married
couples
can
not
truly
love
and
if
barons
sometimes
bring
irregular
consorts
straight
into
their
castles
while
perhaps
winking
at
their
wives
uncanny
doings
all
this
is
true
yet
as
stated
before
not
everything
is
bad
girls
are
taught
not
to
expect
too
much
of
their
spouses
they
usually
accept
the
situation
as
they
accept
stormy
or
sunny
weather
besides
if
some
fathers
or
guardians
are
scandalously
careless
in
disposing
of
their
charges
many
fathers
and
brothers
are
full
of
honest
affection
and
accept
the
duty
of
marrying
off
their
daughters
or
sisters
as
a
solemn
responsibility
and
if
they
are
wise
custodians
the
results
are
usually
happy
there
is
no
need
of
pitying
alienor
too
much
because
she
has
not
the
right
to
elope
conon
has
negotiated
a
most
satisfactory
marriage
he
will
give
his
sister
to
sire
olivier
the
eldest
son
of
the
count
of
perseigne
the
perseignes
are
a
great
burgundian
family
with
many
castles
and
counts
think
themselves
a
little
higher
in
the
social
scale
than
do
barons
but
aliquis
is
also
a
powerful
fief
and
its
alliance
will
be
useful
to
perseigne
when
he
has
his
expected
war
with
the
vidame
of
dijon
conon
will
give
the
young
couple
his
outlying
burgundian
castle
not
of
great
value
to
himself
and
the
alliance
will
enable
him
to
talk
roundly
to
his
uncivil
neighbors
a
most
excellent
match
another
sign
that
aliquis
has
an
extremely
sage
seigneur
alienor
is
now
nearly
seventeen
and
has
been
thinking
about
a
wedding
since
before
she
was
fifteen
her
nurses
have
long
since
reviewed
all
the
eligible
cavaliers
for
her
her
great
dread
has
been
lest
she
have
to
wed
some
old
and
very
stupid
man
as
befell
her
cousin
mabila
who
had
been
sent
away
tearful
and
pouting
to
picardy
the
bride
of
a
widower
who
can
measure
her
relief
when
conon
declared
he
would
not
give
her
to
old
saturnin
it
was
all
very
well
for
the
jongleurs
to
sing
an
old
man
who
loves
a
young
maiden
is
not
merely
old
but
a
fool
the
thing
has
happened
so
often
her
ideal
is
to
have
a
damoiseau
squire
or
young
knight
just
with
his
first
beard
one
who
is
brave
valiant
and
is
of
course
courteous
and
handsome
she
had
once
hoped
that
conon
would
give
a
great
tourney
and
award
her
to
the
conqueror
but
this
desire
faded
when
she
learned
that
the
victor
in
the
last
tourney
was
ugly
and
brutal
she
has
been
on
very
brotherly
terms
with
william
first
squire
but
william
is
still
too
young
and
it
is
not
always
honorable
for
a
squire
to
push
intrigues
in
the
house
of
his
lord
thus
she
is
in
a
very
open
state
of
mind
when
her
brother
says
to
her
one
day
fair
sister
i
have
arranged
your
marriage
with
olivier
of
perseigne
he
is
a
gallant
cavalier
any
maiden
might
rejoice
to
have
him
consider
well
what
i
say
because
here
he
adds
a
phrase
which
he
hopes
will
not
be
taken
too
literally
i
would
not
have
you
wed
him
against
your
wish
if
alienor
has
anything
against
olivier
if
her
antipathy
were
violent
and
based
on
reason
conon
as
a
genuinely
affectionate
brother
might
give
it
weight
but
in
fact
though
she
has
met
olivier
only
a
few
times
at
a
tourney
at
the
christmas
fête
at
the
duke
of
court
and
once
when
he
stopped
at
the
castle
she
has
not
the
least
objection
he
has
certainly
large
blue
eyes
blond
hair
a
large
nose
and
a
merry
laugh
he
is
reported
to
be
kind
to
his
servants
generous
to
a
fault
and
not
overgiven
to
drinking
or
brawling
at
the
tourney
he
broke
three
lances
fairly
against
a
more
experienced
knight
his
family
is
excellent
and
her
brother
desires
are
obvious
she
will
not
have
to
live
too
far
from
aliquis
what
more
could
be
said
after
a
few
hours
of
decent
reflection
she
informs
adela
that
she
will
comply
with
conon
wishes
after
that
the
castle
takes
on
a
joyous
activity
sidenote
betrothal
ceremonies
before
the
wedding
had
come
the
betrothal
it
was
a
solemn
ceremony
blessed
by
the
church
sire
olivier
visited
the
castle
with
a
great
following
of
relatives
and
met
the
shy
and
blushing
alienor
in
the
chapel
after
suitable
prayers
by
father
grégoire
the
pair
had
awkwardly
enough
exchanged
their
promises
i
will
take
you
for
my
wife
and
i
for
my
husband
after
this
there
would
have
been
great
scandal
had
either
side
turned
back
the
church
affirms
energetically
however
that
betrothal
is
marriage
otherwise
the
affianced
pair
might
have
considered
themselves
somewhat
wedded
on
trial
only
to
repudiate
their
obligations
later
also
not
merely
the
young
couple
but
their
parents
or
guardians
had
to
be
present
and
add
their
consent
and
of
course
all
the
pledges
were
sworn
to
over
the
holiest
relics
available
olivier
during
all
this
happy
time
has
lodged
at
the
castle
of
a
friendly
vassal
of
aliquis
and
he
rides
over
frequently
to
visit
his
betrothed
he
is
excellently
bred
and
knows
everything
expected
of
a
prospective
bridegroom
of
good
family
the
alliance
has
been
largely
negotiated
by
his
parents
but
he
has
been
consulted
understands
that
alienor
is
witty
and
beautiful
and
he
is
wholly
aware
of
the
worldly
advantages
of
being
conon
at
meals
he
and
his
beloved
are
allowed
to
sit
together
and
above
all
to
eat
out
of
the
same
porringer
when
he
delicately
leaves
to
his
intended
all
the
best
morsels
he
consults
a
competent
jongleur
and
with
his
aid
produces
suitable
verses
praising
his
fiancée
beauty
he
gives
her
a
gold
ring
with
both
his
own
name
and
hers
engraved
thereon
in
return
besides
a
sleeve
and
a
stocking
to
hang
on
his
lances
gifts
which
she
has
already
sent
in
mere
friendship
to
other
cavaliers
she
bestows
a
lock
of
her
hair
set
around
a
gold
ring
likewise
a
larger
lock
which
he
may
twine
around
his
helmet
the
happy
pair
are
permitted
to
take
long
walks
together
and
to
promenade
up
and
down
the
garden
with
olivier
holding
his
lady
in
the
politest
manner
by
one
finger
the
accepted
method
of
showing
intimacy
we
have
said
that
conon
is
resolved
to
knight
his
brother
at
the
same
time
he
gives
his
sister
in
marriage
this
involves
holding
a
tourney
and
many
other
proceedings
really
unnecessary
for
a
wedding
but
of
course
it
will
attract
a
much
greater
number
of
guests
and
advertise
the
prosperity
of
the
baron
of
aliquis
to
all
northwestern
france
the
knighting
and
tourney
will
come
after
the
bridal
however
and
it
is
easier
to
explain
the
two
things
separately
we
omit
the
gathering
of
the
wedding
guests
the
coming
of
distant
counts
barons
and
sires
the
erection
around
aliquis
of
a
real
village
of
brilliant
tents
and
pavilions
the
ceremonious
greetings
the
frenzied
efforts
of
the
castle
folk
to
make
all
ready
the
inevitable
despair
not
once
but
many
times
of
adela
who
directs
everything
at
last
it
is
the
morning
of
day
in
midsummer
no
rain
and
blessed
be
martin
not
too
much
heat
alienor
is
surrounded
by
a
dozen
women
old
and
young
arraying
her
for
her
wedding
sidenote
dressing
the
bride
there
is
no
regular
bridal
costume
alienor
does
not
dress
much
differently
from
what
she
does
on
easter
or
at
some
other
major
festival
her
two
great
braids
of
hair
are
weighted
down
over
her
breasts
with
an
extra
intertwining
with
gold
thread
her
chemise
is
of
very
fine
linen
her
pelisson
is
completely
fringed
with
magnificent
ermine
the
gift
of
the
countess
of
perseigne
and
the
garment
itself
is
made
of
two
cloths
sewed
together
the
inner
of
fine
wool
the
outer
of
beautiful
bendal
of
reddish
violet
the
whole
is
laced
tightly
until
alienor
can
hardly
breathe
above
this
garment
floats
the
elegant
bliaut
of
green
silk
with
long
sleeves
many
folds
and
a
long
train
there
is
more
silk
embroidery
and
elaborate
flouncing
fairest
of
all
is
the
girdle
made
of
many
pieces
of
gold
and
each
set
with
a
stone
agate
to
guard
against
fever
sardonyx
to
protect
against
malaria
and
many
similar
in
the
clasp
are
great
sapphires
which
baron
garnier
originally
acquired
from
a
town
merchant
shortly
before
he
hanged
him
finally
there
is
the
mantle
again
of
silk
intricately
embroidered
and
dyed
with
a
royal
purple
alienor
pointed
shoes
are
of
vermilion
leather
from
cordova
with
still
more
of
embroidery
while
one
female
minister
is
clasping
these
her
chief
pucelle
is
putting
on
a
small
veil
circular
and
held
down
by
a
golden
circlet
a
genuine
crown
beautifully
engraved
and
set
with
emeralds
inevitably
the
whole
process
of
dressing
is
prolonged
alienor
is
too
excited
to
feel
hot
or
pinched
but
her
attendants
find
her
very
exacting
they
bless
the
virgin
however
that
she
is
not
as
some
noble
brides
who
fly
into
a
passion
if
every
hair
in
their
eyebrows
is
not
separately
adjusted
meantime
in
a
secluded
part
of
the
castle
the
groom
has
been
wrestling
with
a
similar
problem
assisted
by
his
two
squires
although
requiring
less
of
time
and
agony
his
legs
are
covered
with
fine
brown
silk
stockings
from
bruges
but
it
is
effeminate
to
wear
a
silk
shirt
one
of
fine
white
linen
will
answer
his
pelisson
is
like
his
bride
although
less
tightly
laced
of
cloth
and
silk
trimmed
with
rich
fur
and
the
outer
color
is
pale
red
inevitably
with
much
gold
embroidery
around
the
neck
and
sleeves
his
bliaut
does
not
come
below
his
knees
but
it
is
of
blue
sendal
silk
his
mantle
is
also
edged
with
fur
and
of
the
same
color
as
his
pelisson
simple
as
it
is
it
must
hang
exactly
right
everybody
will
ask
did
the
groom
wear
his
mantle
like
a
great
baron
the
squires
take
a
long
time
adjusting
it
olivier
shoes
are
of
very
fine
leather
on
his
crisply
curled
hair
they
set
a
golden
chaplet
set
with
flashing
gems
very
much
like
that
worn
by
his
bride
hardly
are
the
happy
twain
ready
before
the
wedding
procession
forms
in
the
bailey
so
large
a
company
could
never
crowd
into
the
castle
chapel
it
will
go
across
the
bridge
over
the
claire
to
the
parish
church
by
the
village
a
gothic
structure
sufficiently
pretentious
to
suit
the
occasion
the
perseignes
reckon
a
bishop
among
their
cousins
and
he
is
on
hand
to
officiate
sidenote
marriage
procession
and
ceremony
so
the
procession
forms
ahead
go
a
whole
platoon
of
jongleurs
puffing
their
cheeks
for
their
flutes
twanging
their
harps
or
rasping
their
viols
the
feudal
age
delights
in
music
and
does
not
mind
if
sometimes
melody
is
exchanged
merely
for
a
joyous
noise
alienor
comes
next
she
is
on
a
black
mule
with
extra
long
ears
and
a
finely
curried
shining
coat
his
harness
is
of
gold
and
his
trappings
of
scarlet
samite
she
has
been
swung
into
the
saddle
by
her
eldest
brother
alas
that
her
father
who
should
do
this
is
dead
murmur
all
the
women
and
he
as
her
guardian
leads
the
mule
olivier
rides
a
tall
white
palfrey
with
a
saddle
of
blue
leather
his
mother
adela
and
all
the
aliquis
and
perseignes
female
relatives
follow
on
other
mules
led
by
gayly
dressed
squires
then
come
all
the
noble
guests
the
duke
of
quelqueparte
at
their
head
no
wonder
there
is
no
work
being
done
in
all
the
villages
for
miles
around
and
that
all
the
villeins
are
lining
the
road
doffing
caps
and
cheering
as
the
dazzling
cortége
sweeps
past
the
details
at
the
church
we
pass
over
among
other
features
to
be
noted
is
the
fact
that
the
bride
is
swung
down
from
her
mule
upon
a
great
truss
of
straw
that
the
bishop
meets
them
at
the
sacred
portal
and
that
outside
the
actual
building
olivier
and
alienor
exchange
those
vows
which
form
the
essential
part
of
the
marriage
ceremony
after
that
conon
chief
provost
recites
in
loud
voice
all
the
estates
horses
fine
garments
and
servitors
which
the
bride
brings
as
her
dowry
this
customary
publication
may
avert
bitter
disputes
later
next
the
happy
pair
scatter
newly
coined
silver
deniers
among
the
swarm
of
mendicants
permitted
to
elbow
and
scramble
among
the
more
pretentious
guests
finally
the
church
is
thrown
open
the
great
nave
opens
mysterious
and
dark
but
galaxies
of
candles
are
burning
and
the
lofty
windows
gleam
like
jewels
olivier
and
alienor
occupy
seats
of
honor
in
the
choir
while
the
bishop
says
the
very
solemn
mass
of
the
trinity
and
pronounces
a
special
blessing
over
them
let
this
woman
intones
the
prelate
be
amiable
as
rachel
wise
as
rebecca
faithful
as
sarah
let
her
be
sober
through
truth
venerable
through
modesty
and
wise
through
the
teaching
of
heaven
so
at
last
the
mass
ends
the
agnus
dei
is
chanted
the
bridegroom
advances
to
the
altar
and
receives
from
the
bishop
the
kiss
of
peace
then
he
turns
and
right
at
the
foot
of
the
great
crucifix
embraces
his
wife
and
transmits
the
kiss
to
her
this
act
completes
the
ceremony
away
the
whole
company
go
from
the
church
they
have
been
condemned
to
silence
for
nearly
two
hours
and
are
glad
now
to
chatter
like
magpies
when
back
at
aliquis
they
find
the
great
hall
has
been
swept
garnished
and
decorated
as
never
before
the
walls
of
the
hall
are
hung
with
the
pictured
tapestries
or
beautiful
pieces
of
red
and
green
silk
your
feet
crush
fresh
roses
and
lilies
scattered
on
the
floor
alienor
almost
bursts
with
delight
at
the
number
of
cavaliers
and
dames
who
press
up
to
kiss
and
congratulate
all
the
remainder
of
her
life
she
will
match
weddings
with
her
friends
i
had
so
many
counts
and
barons
at
my
marriage
but
i
had
so
many
all
these
guests
however
expect
to
receive
presents
bliauts
mantles
goblets
and
other
things
each
suitable
to
the
recipient
it
is
well
that
conon
has
saved
many
livres
in
his
strong
box
the
presenting
of
the
gifts
by
the
host
is
quite
a
ceremony
each
article
has
to
be
accompanied
by
a
speech
by
the
time
this
reception
to
the
bride
and
groom
is
over
the
trumpets
sound
furiously
they
tell
that
the
feast
is
ready
in
the
fragrant
garden
under
the
trees
there
is
a
fine
tent
of
blue
silk
for
the
bridal
party
and
the
more
exalted
guests
all
the
others
must
sit
on
long
tables
open
to
the
glad
sunshine
sidenote
the
marriage
feast
what
messire
conon
guests
have
to
eat
and
drink
is
so
serious
a
topic
that
we
must
tell
thereof
separately
we
speak
here
merely
concerning
the
festivities
of
the
wedding
olivier
and
alienor
are
served
by
two
barons
as
squires
of
state
the
groom
drinks
from
a
great
goblet
then
sends
it
to
his
wife
who
ceremoniously
finishes
the
draught
in
the
bridal
tent
there
is
a
reasonable
amount
of
decorum
but
elsewhere
blessed
martyrs
what
noise
and
tumult
all
the
villeins
appear
to
be
there
and
burghers
have
even
wandered
up
from
pontdebois
it
will
never
do
to
have
men
say
the
bride
was
charming
but
her
brother
stinted
his
hospitality
enough
food
and
drink
is
gorged
and
guzzled
to
stave
off
a
famine
next
winter
the
jongleurs
keep
quiet
during
the
first
part
of
the
feast
later
they
earn
their
dinner
by
singing
of
the
loves
of
jourdain
and
orabel
or
of
berte
who
was
the
faithful
wife
of
girard
of
roussillon
through
all
of
her
lord
adversity
at
many
of
the
tables
the
jesting
and
horseplay
become
unspeakably
ribald
after
the
wine
circulates
two
petty
nobles
quarrel
one
strikes
the
other
with
a
drinking
cup
but
the
sergeants
pull
them
apart
before
they
can
whip
out
swords
after
three
hours
of
this
some
guests
are
sleeping
stertorously
under
the
trees
but
those
nobles
who
have
kept
their
wits
go
to
another
large
tent
and
despite
their
heavy
meal
dance
with
vigor
the
bride
and
groom
are
expected
to
dance
together
and
everybody
is
prepared
to
admire
the
beauty
of
one
and
the
grace
and
strength
of
the
other
as
evening
advances
a
priest
appears
he
solemnly
blesses
the
nuptial
couch
strewn
with
roses
while
the
new
couple
piously
kneel
the
couch
is
then
censed
like
an
altar
and
the
women
guests
join
in
the
bizarre
usages
of
putting
the
bride
to
bed
the
morning
after
the
marriage
the
newly
wedded
pair
attend
mass
in
the
castle
chapel
here
they
are
expected
to
make
privately
all
kinds
of
vows
of
good
conduct
and
alienor
especially
promises
always
to
obey
her
husband
and
call
him
dutifully
mon
sire
and
mon
baron
the
festivities
will
last
two
weeks
longer
and
conclude
with
the
dubbing
of
knights
and
the
tournament
whereof
more
presently
after
that
olivier
and
his
wife
will
depart
for
their
burgundian
castle
without
anything
like
a
honeymoon
to
strange
parts
so
they
celebrate
the
wedding
at
aliquis
very
far
is
it
from
being
a
love
match
of
a
later
day
yet
there
is
a
decent
hope
of
happiness
for
the
two
most
deeply
interested
a
new
spirit
in
the
relations
of
men
and
women
has
been
creeping
into
the
world
since
greek
and
roman
days
and
if
this
spirit
too
often
manifests
itself
in
illicit
romances
it
is
something
if
romantic
love
can
exist
at
all
and
if
also
in
many
an
instance
as
the
jongleurs
already
like
to
tell
us
their
story
can
run
that
thus
the
twain
were
wedded
and
forevermore
lived
together
happily
it
was
as
early
as
about
that
the
south
country
troubador
bernart
de
ventadoun
sang
about
the
great
motive
which
was
coming
to
add
beauty
to
the
world
for
indeed
i
know
of
no
more
subtle
passion
under
heaven
than
is
the
maiden
passion
for
a
maid
not
only
to
keep
down
the
base
within
a
man
but
teach
high
thought
and
amiable
words
and
courtliness
and
the
desire
of
fame
and
love
of
truth
and
all
that
makes
a
man
footnotes
of
course
the
northern
climate
and
the
fact
that
the
germanic
tribes
wore
many
garments
of
skins
and
leather
were
contributing
factors
from
a
mediæval
of
instructions
to
a
young
troubadour
and
romance
love
stories
were
thus
likely
to
revolve
around
very
young
and
flighty
people
if
they
survived
this
critical
period
of
youth
they
were
likely
to
be
staid
and
sober
enough
the
rest
of
their
lives
how
serious
the
problem
of
the
forbidden
degrees
could
be
is
shown
by
the
case
of
the
pious
louis
vii
of
france
who
put
away
his
wife
the
great
heiress
eleanor
of
aquitaine
because
he
was
the
fifth
in
descent
from
hugh
capet
who
had
married
a
sister
of
the
of
eleanor
of
course
the
marriage
had
actually
proved
uncongenial
before
this
point
was
raised
friends
would
seldom
walk
arm
in
arm
two
persons
of
the
same
sex
or
of
different
sexes
would

that
if
one
desires
a
wedding
and
a

although
the
first

several
thousands

we
would
marvel
at
the
quantity
of
boiled
meat
served
at
aliquis
about
the
only
way
to
preserve
meat
is
to
salt
it
the
vats
of
the
castle
are
full
of
salted
meat
kept
against
winter
or
a
siege
and
this
flesh
must
ordinarily
be
boiled
the
result
is
that
a
great
copper
meat
pot
seems
always
in
action
with
a
boy
pumping
the
bellows
to
make
the
caldron
bubble
but
fowls
and
fresh
meat
are
often
boiled
as
well
butcher
meat
however
is
less
welcome
at
feasts
than
is
game
an
ideal
dish
is
a
stag
roasted
whole
in
the
great
fireplace
crisped
and
larded
then
cut
up
into
quarters
and
served
on
very
large
plates
upon
such
dishes
is
poured
a

a

will
be

folk
are
not
at
all
vegetarians
but
they
can
not

forever

before

of
the

that
all
his

make
a

of
loaves
huge

smaller

there
is
a
soft
bread
made
of
milk

butter
a
dog
bread
and
bread
of
alternate
layers
of
wheat

then
there
are
the
table
loaves
sizable
pieces
of

to
be
spread
around
the

courteous
cavaliers
will
cut
all
the
crust
with
their
knives
and
pass
the
remainder
to
the
ladies
their
companions
to
soak
up
in
their
soup
the
servants
have
less
select
common
bread
although
it
is
still
wheaten
finally
there
are
breads
or
crackers
these
are
often
used
in
monasteries
also
in
the
provisioning
of
castles
against
a
siege
sidenote
breads

fancy
jellies

sweet

are
coming

they
have
not
reached
the

be
attained

they
are
able
to
prepare

taste
which
developed

sent
up
from
provence
likewise
a
good
deal
of
olive
oil
but
the
oil
used
in
common
cooking
is
often
extracted
from
walnuts
or
even
from
poppies
another
favorite
flavoring
is
with
rose
water
all
through
june
you
can
see
great
basins
of
water
filled
with
rose
petals
steeping
in
the
sun
the
liquor
thus
obtained
will
add
zest
to
sauces
for
the
next
twelve
months
there
is
also
a
certain
whitish
substance
known
as
sugar
it
comes
from
the
levant
in
small
irregular
lumps
its
flavoring
qualities
are
delightful
but
it
is
too
expensive
to
use
in
cookery
a
small
quantity
is
passed
about
among
conon
higher
guests
to
be
eaten
as
a
confection
the
ordinary
sweetening
is
still
that
of
the
greeks
and
romans
honey
supplied
from
the
hives
of
the
bees
belonging
to
the
monastery
cheeses
hardly
figure
in
feasts
but
for
everyday
diet
they
are
important
on
feast
days
they
often
replace
meat
their
varieties
are
legion
white
green
large
small
etc
some
places
produce
famous
cheeses
exported
all
over
france
and
in
paris
one
can
hear
the
street
venders
shrilly
chanting
buy
my
cheese
from
champagne
or
my
cheese
from
brie
as
for
eggs
and
butter
they
are
gifts
of
the
kindly
saints
to
carry
men
through
lent
and
fast
days
theologians
have
said
that
hens
were
aquatic
creatures
like
other
birds
that
hence
good
christians
could
eat
their
eggs
freely
but
butter
by
some
unaccountable
notion
if
eaten
during
times
of
abstinence
must
be
freshly
churned
it
must
not
be
salted
nor
used
for
cooking
purposes
passing
next
to
beverages
be
it
said
that
the
aliquis
denizens
are
fairly
abstemious
folk
all
of
them
sometimes
get
tipsy
even
adela
and
alienor
but
only
seldom
conon
servants
help
him
to
bed
once
or
twice
per
year
down
in
the
villages
there
are
disgraceful
guzzlings
among
the
peasants
especially
on
saints
days
but
the
beverages
are
not
very
alcoholic
one
must
absorb
a
great
deal
to
be
really
upset
the
region
grows
its
own
wine
for
ordinary
consumption
and
a
little
thereof
is
shipped
to
paris
and
even
to
flanders
and
england
along
with
the
more
famous
vintages
of
gascony
saintonge
macon
rheims
the
marne
and
the
orleanais
the
most
desirable
french
wine
is
that
of
pourcain
in
auvergne
and
the
baron
has
a
carefully
cherished
tun
of
the
same
in
his
cellars
poems
indeed
exist
in
praise
of
this
pourcain
wine
which
you
drink
for
the
good
of
your
health
on
occasions
of
great
state
however
imported
wines
will
be
produced
mainly
because
they
are
unusual
and
expensive
the
aliquis
feasters
are
consequently
offered
heady
cyprian
and
lesbian
from
the
levant
also
aquilian
from
spain
and
not
a
little
rhenish

lands

distant
sidenote
wine
beer
and
other
drinks
in
the
autumn
when
the
apples
and
pears
are
falling
the
peasants
will
make
cider
and
perry
and
get
outrageously
drunk
when
these
beverages
grow
hard
but
outside
of
normandy
such
drink
seldom
appeals
to
castle
folk
there
are
also
in
common
use
many
substitute
wines
really
infusions
of
wormwood
hyssop
and
rosemary
and
taken
mostly
to
clear
the
system
although
nectar
made
of
spices
asiatic
aromatics
and
honey
is
really
in
request
the
great
competitor
of
wine
is
beer
in
northern
france
we
are
in
the
dividing
zone
between
the
land
of
the
winepress
and
the
land
of
the
brewhouse
everybody
drinks
beer
and
makes
beer
the
castle
has
a
great
brewhouse
likewise
the
monastery
beer
is
made
of
barley
and
only
late
in
the
middle
ages
will
hops
be
added
to
add
to
the
zest
really
fine
beer
is
from
the
german
good
and
ale
or
double
beer
common
beer
is
small
beer
since
the
crusaders
have
returned
from
the
east
spiced
beer
has
been
growing
in
favor
charged
with
juniper
resin
gentian
cinnamon
and
the
like
until
the
original
taste
has
been
wholly
destroyed
the
aliquis
folk
do
not
however
disdain
buttermilk
this
they
like
to
ferment
boil
up
with
onions
and
garlic
then
cool
in
a
closed
vessel
the
product
is
the
enjoyment
of
which
is
surely
difficult
for
a
stranger
another
form
of
beverage
is
not
quite
unknown
some
physicians
prescribe
water
of
gold
and
allege
it
prolongs
health
dissipates
superfluous
matters
revives
the
spirits
and
promotes
youth
also
it
greatly
assists
the
cure
of
colic
dropsy
paralysis
and
ague
of
a
surety
it
aids
the
patient
temporarily
to
forget
his
troubles
yet
this
is
hardly
more
than
a
costly
medicine
many
years
later
it
will
become
more
common
but
its
name
will
be
changed
to
brandy
the
usages
even
of
a
great
dinner
depend
largely
on
the
customs
of
everyday
life
one
can
not
understand
the
splendors
of
the
marriage
feast
of
sire
olivier
and
alienor
without
knowing
what
goes
on
regularly
in
the
hall
of
aliquis
when
the
day
is
started
we
have
seen
how
everybody
arises
to
a
very
light
breakfast
of
bread
and
wine
although
sometimes
as
in
the
epic
of
doon
of
mayence
when
the
work
promises
to
be
arduous
the
squire
may
bring
him
a
favorite
pasty
because
eating
early
in
the
morning
brings
health
and
gives
one
greater
courage
and
spirit
dinner
also
we
have
discovered
can
begin
as
early
as
nine
in
the
morning
and
a
good
part
of
the
day
business
comes
after
this
heavy
meal
sometimes
when
dinner
is
late
you
do
not
serve
your
guests
any
regular
supper
but
when
they
go
to
bed
have
the
attendants
bring
cakes
and
fruits
and
wine
if
you
entertain
guests
however
always
it
is
proper
to
try
to
make
them
eat
and
drink
as
much
as
possible
there
is
a
story
of
an
overhospitable
count
of
guines
who
not
merely
constrained
any
knight
passing
through
his
dominions
to
a
feast
but
kept
quantities
of
white
wine
always
on
hand
so
that
if
his
visitors
asked
to
have
their
red
wine
diluted
with
water
they
might
be
hoodwinked
by
seeing
a
white
liquid
mixed
in
their
goblets
in
this
way
he
once
rendered
the
whole
suite
of
a
bishop
gloriously
intoxicated
the
ingenious
bartolomes
of
granvilla
has
laid
down
the
following
requisites
for
an
ideal
banquet
a
suitable
hour
not
too
early
nor
too
late
a
pleasant
place
a
gracious
and
liberal
host
plenty
to
eat
so
one
may
choose
one

the
same
as
to
things
to
drink
willing
servants
agreeable
company
pleasant
music
plenty
of
light
good
cooking
a
seasonable
conclusion
quiet
and
repose
afterward
a
marriage
feast
and
a
tourney
can
hardly
provide
this
twelfth
desideratum
but
they
ought
with
proper
management
to
supply
everything
else

whole
process
is
under

orders

his
platoons
of
attendants
with
as
much
precision
as
he
might
command
the
men
at

to
wait

to
do
this
for

there
are
plenty
of

portable
wealth
of

be
laboriously
counted

the
jostling

is

live
close

are
always

you
entered

would

your
turn
at

would

would

delight

during

but
now
at
a
great
festival
when
you
enter
the
special
banqueting

you
are
met
by
two
handsome
varlets
the

a

jug
and
a

is
dexterously
poured
over
your
fingers

promptly

off

varlet

each
guest
patiently
waits
until
the
persons
ahead
have
enjoyed
this
courtesy
so
they
enter
the
tent
and
the
magnates
make
for
the
seats

honor
the
placing
of
the

has

bloody
feuds
have

it
is
a

for
supreme
diplomacy
so
far
as
possible

fails

idea
is
to
tempt
the
appetite
to
utter
satiety
by
forcing
first
one
dish
upon
the
feasters
and
then
another
there
is
not

a
good
sequence

most
of
the
dishes
are
heavy
and
inasmuch

seems
one

a
feast
of
ceremony
in
the
twelfth

it
was
the
custom
during
the
repast
to
bring
in
enormous
pâtés
which
held
little
live
birds

flew
about
the

an
elaborate

had
been
required
on
a
fast
day
the
cooks
could
still
have
met
the
occasion
and
yet
have
kept
within
the
commands
of
the
church
although
not
merely
would
there
have
been
much
fish
but
also
more
vegetables
the
guests
could
have
been
served
with
roast
apples
garnished
with
sorrel
and
rosemary
then
might
have
come
a
rich

would
have
been

these
can
be

this
dinner
might
seem
only
a
little
less
gorging
than
the
orthodox
feast
upon
meats
but
elaborate
as
is
this
wedding
banquet
at
last
everybody
has
had
his
fill
the
concluding
baked

the
peeled
walnuts

have
been
passed
the
noble

have
chewed
their

wine
is
handed
around
but
nobody
has
drunk
too
much
to
become
worse
than
merrily

before
rising
the
guests
have
all
very
properly
thought
of
the
poor
called
in
the
servitors
and
piled
all
the
loose
food
upon
great
platters
to
be
kept
for
the
needy
in

all
the
indigent
in
the
region
are
eating
voraciously
at
the
outer
tables
but
on
the
morrow
of
a
festival
day
you
will
see
a
great
collection
of
halt
sickly
and
shiftless
hanging
around
the
barbican
in
just
expectation
that
conon
and
adela
will
order
a
distribution
at
last
the
bishop
returns

basins
pitchers
and
towels
are
again
carried
around

the
guests
rise
some
to
mingle
with
the
less
exalted
visitors
outside
some
to
repose
under
the
shade
trees
some
to
listen
to
the
jongleurs
who
are
now
tuning
their

many
especially
the
younger
to
get
ready
for
the
thing
we
have
seen
they
liked
almost
the

the
service
has
naturally
been
less
ceremonious

has
been
welcome
to
wander
into

been
elbowing
up

bawling
to
the
servitors
to
refill
their
leather
flagons
and
throwing
bits
of
cheese
and
bread
around
in
an
outrageously
wasteful
manner
thousands
of
persons
apparently
many
of
whom
will
be
happy
if
they
can
have
black
bread
all
through
the
winter
are
trying
to
avenge
past
hunger
by

as
much
as

to
sing

thundering
out

give
some

what
threatens
to
become
a
disgracefully
confused

coarse
form
of
reveling

what

for

by

is
no
reason
for
believing

lavish

not
fairly
common

is

appeal
more
to

than

most
of

six
thousand

thousand
lines
in

besides
many
shorter

maître
edmond
knows
a
surprising
number
of
them
all
these
bald
figures
give
some
idea
of
the
richness
of
this
type
of
feudal
literature
of
course
the
famous
chanson
de
roland
constitutes
the
most
splendid
narrative
everybody
knows
the
story
of
how
roland
and
olivier
the
favorite
peers
of
charlemagne
were
betrayed
to
the
paynim
in
spain
by
the
foul
traitor
ganelon
how
they
sold
their
lives
right
dearly
after
innumerable
doughty
deeds
how
their
souls
ascended
to
heaven
and
how
later
charlemagne
took
terrific
vengeance
both
on
the
infidels
and
on
ganelon
it
is
an
epic
which
in
later
days
will
be
rated
equal
if
not
superior
to
its
german
rival
the
nibelungenlied
but
the
song
of
roland
is
now
nearly
two
centuries
old
and
is
very
familiar
besides
it
is
too
long
for
one
afternoon
and
it
is
hard
to
pick
out
episodes
maître
edmond
proposes
some
scenes
from
the
stories
of
troy
but
the
baron
thinks
they
are
not
sufficiently
sentimental
for
the
occasion
so
they
agree
on
the
story
of
tristan
and
ysolt
this
is
fairly
well
known
by
the
company
but
is
not
threadbare
it
gives
plenty
of
opportunity
for
the
women
to
weep
and
the
jongleur
says
that
he
has
a
new
version
not
overlengthy
maître
edmond
therefore
strides
out
into
the
bridal
tent
accompanied
by
a
handsome
youth
in
a
saffron
mantle
who
thrums
a
harp
with
silver
frets
the
high
jongleur
begins
his
story
in
an
easy
recitative
which
occasionally
breaks
into
melodious
arias
it
is
really
a
mingling
of
verse
and
prose
although
the
language
never
loses
a
certain
meter
and
rhythm

sidenote
story
of

the
narrative
runs
along
the
conventional
lines
king
mark
of
cornwall
was
a
good
man
and
wise
prince
the
beautiful
ysolt
was
his
wife
the

and
poetic
tristan
his
nephew
these
last
two
in
all
innocency
take
a
magic
potion
which
compels
them
to
fall
in
love
and
any
sinful
deeds
which
follow
are
excused
by
the
enchantment
king
mark
suffers
for
long
trying
to
forgive
but
at
last
catching
tristan
playing
the
lute
in
the
queen
bower
smites
him
with
a
poisoned
dart
the
unhappy
youth
mortally
wounded
takes
refuge
in
the
house
of
his
friend

while
he
is
still
alive
king
mark
magnanimously
says
he
is
sorry
for
his
act
while
poor
ysolt
announces
that
she
will
not
survive
her
lover
so
tristan
sends
for
his
uncle
and
tells
mark
that
he
bears
him
no
ill
will
while
the
king
realizing
his
nephew
is
not
morally
guilty
laments
alas
alas
woe
to
me
for
having
stabbed
my
nephew
the
best
cavalier
in
the
whole
world
after
that
mark
and
ysolt
visit
tristan
and
make
lamentation
over
his
dying
state
he
presently
causes
his
sword
to
be
drawn
that
he
may
see
it
for
the
last
time
alas
good
sword
what
will
become
of
you
henceforth
without
your
trusty
lord
i
now
take
leave
of
knighthood
which
i
have
honored
alas
my
friends
tristan
is
vanquished
then
with
tears
he
bequeathes
his
sword
to
his
comrade
in
arms
next
he
turns
to
the
queen
very
dear
lady
he
gasps
what
will
you
do
when
i
die
will
you
not
die
with
me
gentle
friend
says
ysolt
i
call
god
to
witness
that
nothing
would
afford
me
so
much
joy
as
to
bear
you
company
this
day
assuredly
if
ever
a
woman
could
die
of
anguish
or
sorrow
i
should
have
died
already
and
would
you
like
then
to
die
with
me
asks
tristan
god
knows
replied
the
queen
that
never
did
i
desire
anything
more
sincerely
approach
me
then
whispers
the
knight
for
i
feel
death
coming
upon
me
and
i
should
like
to
breathe
my
last
in
your
arms
ysolt
leans
over
tristan
who
embraces
her
and
presses
her
so
tightly
that
her
heart
bursts
and
he
expires
with
her
thus
mingling
their
last
sighs
needless
to
say
by
the
time
maître
edmond
after
much
skillful
prolongation
and
stirring
of
the
feelings
has
finished
all
the
noble
dames
are
indulging
in
sobs
and
indeed
many
of
the
barons
blink
hard
it
is
a
delightfully
tragic
story
although
the
minstrel
is
of
too
high
a
quality
to
cry
largesse
when
he
concludes
like
all
the
humbler
jongleurs
there
are
many
deniers
thrown
his
way
which
the
harpist
duly
gathers
the
duke
tells
him
come
to
my
court
at
christmas
and
recite
the
love
of
launcelot
and
guinevere

shall
be
worth

sidenote
a
literary
baron
maître
edmond
has
however
another
line
of
business
his
opportunity
opens
this
way
among
conon
guests
is
a
baron
of
harvengt
this
rich
seigneur
has
spent
much
time
in
the
south
country
he
has
learned
the
gay
science
of
the
troubadours
superior
minstrels
are
always
welcome
at
his
castle
in
fact
he
is
something
of
a
minstrel
himself
indeed
it
is
claimed
he
is
too
much
interested
in
matters
which
are
primarily
only
for
villeins
or
at
best
for
the
women
and
neglects
his
hawks
tourneys
and
even
his
proper
feuds
with
his
neighbors
nevertheless
orri
de
harvengt
is
an
extremely
gentle
man
he
possesses
a
considerable
number
of
books
in
latin
virgil
ovid
lucan
and
others
although
a
visiting
monk
has
grumbled
that
nearly
all
the
volumes
are
by
questionable
pagans
and
that
this
baron
has
almost
no
parchments
of
saints
lives
and
church
fathers
however
orri
spends
little
time
over
the
latin
he
holds
that
the
classical
language
is
best
for
religious
matters
but
that
for
telling
of
brave
deeds
and
affairs
of
the
heart
nothing
surpasses
romance
the
tongue
of
north
france
a
friend
of
orri
was
geoffroi
de
villehardouin
who
has
written
in
french
an
excellent
history
of
the
fourth
crusade
in
which
he
participated
and
although
the
churchmen
complain
that
his
abandonment
of
latin
means
the
ruin
of
all
learning
the
use
of
the
vulgar
tongue
for
all
kinds
of
books
is
undoubtedly
increasing
for
the
less
formal
kind
of
writings
there
is
already
a
considerable
french
literature
conon
himself
has
a
book
of
philosophers
proverbs
a
collection
of
wise
saws
and
maxims
that
are
often
attributed
to
such
ancient
worthies
as
homer
æsop
moses
and
solomon
but
which
have
a
flavor
extremely
french
here
you
can
find
many
a
saying
that
will
long
survive
the
thirteenth
century
although
it
is
doubtless
much
more
ancient
a
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
god
helps
those
who
help
themselves
a
friend
in
need
is
a
friend
indeed
still
waters
run
deep
all
are
threadbare
wisdom
around
aliquis
as
well
as
such
maxims
as
do
not
transmit
so
well
such
as
among
the
blind
the
man
is
king
and
famine
drives
the
wolf
out
of
the
woods
but
the
bulk
of
this
vulgar
literature
is
in
poetry
the
epics
have
been
growing
ever
since
a
certain
turould
is
said
to
have
composed
the
song
of
roland
not
very
long
after
we
have
just
seen
what
a
wealth
of
romances
maître
edmond
has
at
his
disposal
the
earlier
of
these
tales
are
mere
recitals
of
war
and
adventure
but
in
the
later
though
they
continue
in
the
north
french
dialect
the
south
french
troubadour
influence
appears
we
have
stories
turning
about
lawful
or
illicit
love
rather
than
about
lance
thrusts
the
troubadours
of
the
langeudoc
language
find
now
compeers
in
the
of
the
northern
languedoil
baron
orri
is
a
himself
he
has
tried
his
hand
at
making
a
on
the
adventures
of
the
hero
renaud
of
montauban
while
composers
of
less
exalted
rank
prepare
the
shorter
and
which
abound
with
comedy
and
sarcasm
striking
at
all
the
vices
and
follies
of
society
sidenote
north
french
epics
and
romances
baron
orri
however
who
is
not
an
original
genius
is
perhaps
to
be
classed
really
as
an
that
is
he
adapts
old
romances
and
puts
them
in
a
new
setting
he
changes
over
stories
from
the
languedoc
or
from
the
breton
to
his
north
french
dialect
at
a
quiet
interval
maître
edmond
takes
him
aside
fair
baron
you
know
that
we
master
jongleurs
seldom
wish
to
set
written
copies
of
the
poems
we
chant
before
strangers
but
how
can
i
deny
anything
to
so
liberal
a
seigneur
as
you
i
have
with
me
transcripts
of
a
new
song
concerning
charlemagne
paladin
william
of
orange
and
another
prepared
by
the
great
robert
of
borron
concerning
the
finding
of
the
holy
grail
by
king
artus
knight
sire
perceval
would
you
have
sight
of
them
baron
orri
is
only
too
pleased
before
he
quits
aliquis
he
will
have
possessed
himself
of
the
precious
parchments
and
maître
edmond
becomes
the
richer
by
several
paris
livres
a
fine
copy
of
a
great

worth
its
weight
in
silver
the
monks
complain
that
the
capital
letters
are
as
carefully
elaborated
in
gold
and
the
miniature
illustrations
are
as
delicately
executed
as
those
in
a
copy
of
the
gospel

of
embossed

the

nevertheless
neglecting
holier
things
seem
willing
to
stand

long
however
before
the
wedding
guests
end
their
happy
day
another
entertainer
than
maître
edmond
is
asked
to
perform
it
is
baron
orri
himself
he
has
lived
so
long
in
the
south
country
that
he
has
caught
the
troubadour
gallantries

run
that
he
has
left
three

loves
in
three
different
castles
that
he
has
had
a
most
romantic
duel
with
a
jealous
husband
which
ended
however
in
a
reconciliation
on
proof
that
the
friendship
had
been
only
platonic
and
that
he
is
a
past
master
in
all
the
different
methods
of
rhyming
and
the
different
kinds
of
stanzas
with
which
the
expert
bards
of

serve
up
their
sentimental
ditties
at
a
suitable
moment
just

are

could

that
a

were
worth
more
than
a

doubtless
you
would
think
me
rude
therefore
i
will
obey
though
many
of
you

the

eyes
are
fixed
mischievously
on
a
certain
countess
with
whom
he
had
talked
intimately
all
the
afternoon
her
husband
looks
somewhat
awkward
but
at
the
end
he
joins
in
the
warm
applause
so
the
entertainment
at
the
wedding
feast
ends
and
the
great
secular
literature
which
is
to
be
the
priceless
heritage
of
later
civilization
is
despite
much
crudeness
and
false
sentimentality
being
born
hitherto
we
have
seen
the
life
of
aliquis
at
peace
now
we
must
gradually
turn
toward
its
grimmer
aspects
and
the
direct
preparations
for
war

if
aliquis
had
been
a
slightly
larger
fief
its
lord
would
probably
have
allowed
himself
the
luxury
of
a
professional
minstrel
in

half
musician
and
half
jester
it
was
not
unknown
for
jongleurs
of
this
inferior
grade
to
stop
at
an
exciting
part
of
the
story
they
were
narrating
and
say
as
in
the
poem

of
burgundy
whoever
wants
to
hear
more
of
this
recital
must
haste
to
open
his
purse
for
now
it
is
high
time
to
give
me
something
the
company
would
thus
be
straightway
held
up
or
the
entertainer
would
announce
it
was
too
near
vespers
or
he
was
too
weary
to
finish
that
day
the
result
being
that
he
could
claim
hospitality
at
the
castle
of
his
hosts

he
could

a

held
by
a

of
noble

he
does
not
own
this

by

of

his

sidenote
duties
of
fief
holders
yet
there
are
some
pretty
definite
rules
about
fief
holding
generally
speaking
a
fief
includes
enough
land
to
maintain
at
least
one
knight
and
his
war
horse
this
warrior
is
obligated
usually
to
lead
out
a
number
of
armed
villeins
proportionate
to
the
number
of
knights
the
conditions
on
which
the
estate
can
be
held
vary
infinitely
the
great
obligation
is
military
service
the
average
vassal
is
bound
to
follow
his
suzerain
for
forty
days
per
year
on
summons
to
an
offensive
war
he
is
required
to
give
much
greater
assistance
in
a
strictly
defensive
war
and
especially
to
aid
in
the
defense
of
his
lord
castle
he
has
to
wait
on
the
suzerain
at
times
when
the
latter
may
desire
a
great
retinue
to
give
prestige
to
his
court
at
such
gatherings
he
must
likewise
assist
his
lord
in
dispensing
justice
a
matter
sometimes
involving
considerable
responsibility
for
the
judges
when
his
seigneur
marries
off
his
eldest
daughter
bestows
knighthood
on
his
eldest
son
or
needs
ransom
money
if
held
a
prisoner
the
vassals
must
contribute
and
the
aliquis
fief
holders
are
blessing
their
patron
saints
that
alienor
and
aimery
are
not
their
overlord
children
otherwise
they
would
pay
for
most
of
the
high
festivities
themselves
they
must
also
when
their
lord
visits
them
give
him
proper
hospitality
in
their
castles
of
course
they
must
never
betray
his
secrets
adhere
to
his
enemies
or
repudiate
the
pledges
made
to
him
to
do
so
were
treason
the
worst
of
all
feudal
crimes
we
have
seen
that
holding
a
fief
usually
implies
military
service
and
that
if
the
estate
falls
to
a
woman
the
suzerain
can
administer
the
property
until
the
maid
is
of
marriageable
age
and
then
give
her
to
some
competent
liegeman
it
is
about
the
same
if
the
heir
is
a
boy
the
overlord
can
exercise
guardianship
over
the
fief
until
the
lad
is
old
enough
to
lead
out
his
war
band
and
otherwise
to
prove
a
desirable
vassal
even
when
the
vassals
are
of
satisfactory
sex
and
age
the
suzerain
is
entitled
to
a
a
money
payment
whenever
an
old
knight
dies
and
his
son
takes
over
the
barony
this
is
always
a
fairly
heavy
lump
sum
and
is
still
heavier
if
the
fief
goes
not
to
the
son
but
to
a
collateral
heir
also
when
the
vassal
wants
to
sell
his
fief
to
some
stranger
not
merely
must
the
suzerain
approve
the
change
but
he
is
entitled
to
an
extra
large
fee
often
as
much
as
three
years
revenue
from
the
entire
holding
nevertheless
when
all
is
said
many
fief
holders
act
as
if
they
were
anything
but
humble
vassals
happy
is
many
a
suzerain
when
he
is
so
exempt
from
squabbles
with
his
feudal
equals
and
his
own
overlord
that
he
can
compel
his
loyal
lieges
to
execute
all
their
promises
and
when
he
can
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
dictating
to
them
the
manner
whereby
they
must
rule
their
lands
some
of
the
mottoes
of
the
great
baronial
houses
testify
how
little
the
feudal
hierarchy
counts
with
the
lord
of
a
few
strong
castles
boast
the
mighty
rohans
dukes
we
disdain
kings
we
ca
be
are
we
and
still
more
arrogant
is
that
of
a
seigneur
whose
magnificent
is
in
the
process
of
erection
no
king
am
i
no
prince
no
duke
i
just
the
sire
of
coucy
and
to
be
sire
of
coucy
means
to
dispose
of
such
power
that
when
the
canons
of
rheims
complain
to
king
philip
against
his
deeds
of
violence
the
king
can
merely
reply
i
can
do
no
more
for
you
than
the
sire
of
coucy
to
leave
you
unmolested
sometimes
in
addition
to
money
payments
or
personal
or
military
service
a
vassal
is
required
to
make
symbolic
gifts
in
token
of
loyal
intentions
thus
annually
conon
sends
to
the
duke
of
quelqueparte
three
black
horses
while
for
his
holdings
of
the
local
abbey
every
june
he
presents
the
abbot
with
a
basket
of
roses
and
a
bunch
of
lilies
and
many
other
estates
are
burdened
with
some
such
peculiar
duties
sidenote
barons
largely
independent
so
long
as
he
discharges
his
feudal
obligations
a
seigneur
can
run
his
barony
practically
to
suit
himself
if
he
treats
his
own
vassals
and
his
peasants
too
outrageously
they
may
cry
out
to
the
suzerain
for
justice
and
sometimes
the
overlord
will
delight
in
an
excuse
to
humble
an
arrogant
feudatory
but
the
limits
of
interference
are
well
marked
no
seigneur
should
undermine
a
faithful
vassal
hold
on
his
own
subjects
every
noble
will
feel
his
own
rights
threatened
if
a
suzerain
begins
to
meddle
with
a
dependent
even
if
the
reason
for
doing
so
is
manifest
many
a
baron
can
therefore
play
the
outrageous
tyrant
if
so
the
devil
inspires
him
he
has
as
we
have
seen
to
observe
the
vested
rights
of
his
subordinates
on
the
fief
otherwise
he
may
provoke
a
dangerous
mutiny
within
his
own
castle
baron
garnier
of
aliquis
however
has
been
typical
of
many
of
his
class
prisoners
travelers
peasants
are
subject
to
unspeakably
brutal
treatment
as
has
been
written
concerning
one
such
seigneur
he
was
a
very
pluto
megæra
cerberus
or
anything
you
can
conceive
still
more
horrible
he
preferred
the
slaughter
of
his
captives
to
their
ransom
he
tore
out
the
eyes
of
his
own
children
when
in
sport
they
hid
their
faces
under
his
cloak
he
impaled
persons
of
both
sexes
on
stakes
to
butcher
men
in
the
most
horrible
manner
was
to
him
an
agreeable
feast
of
another
such
baron
the
trembling
monks
record
when
anyone
by
force
or
fraud
fell
into
his
hands
the
captive
might
truly
say
pains
of
hell
have
compassed
me
about
homicide
was
his
passion
and
glory
he
treated
his
wife
in
an
unspeakably
brutal
manner
men
feared
him
bowed
down
to
him
and
worshiped
him
sidenote
types
of
evil
and
good
barons
evidently
such
outrageous
seigneurs
hold
their
lieges
in
a
kind
of
fascinated
obedience
just
as
do
the
emirs
and
atabegs
among
the
infidels
of
course
they
treat
merchants
as
merely
so
many
objects
for
plunder
if
they
do
not
watch
the
roads
themselves
they
make
bargains
with
professional
robbers
allowing
the
latter
to
infest
their
seigneuries
in
return
for
an
agreed
share
of
their
booty
even
noble
folk
are
liable
to
be
seized
imprisoned
and
perhaps
tortured
to
get
a
ransom
if
you
can
not
find
the
deniers
you
may
leave
your
bones
in
a
foul
dungeon
nevertheless
michael
and
all
angels
be
praised
this
evil
is
abating
in
the
direct
royal
dominions
such
men
of
sin
have
been
rooted
out
since
old
louis
vi
time
the
church
is
using
its
great
influence
against
evil
sires
the
communal
towns
are
waxing
strong

sending

to
besiege
their

and

are
gradually
asserting
themselves
after
the
heyday
of
petty
tyrannies
yet
there
are
still
queersome
happenings
on
every
seigneury
and
the
amount
of
arbitrary
power
possessed
by
the
average
baron
is
not
good
even
for
a
conscientious
and
man
it
is
not
the
theoretical
powers
of
a
seigneur
but
his
actual
mental
and
ofttimes
physical
ability
which
determines
the
real
extent
of
his
power
fiefs
are
anything
but
static
they
are
always
growing
or
diminishing
a
capable
seigneur
is
always
attracting
new
lands
to
himself
he
ejects
unfaithful
vassals
and
adds
their
estates
to
his
own
personal
domain
land
he
induces
his
vassal
vassals
to
transfer
their
allegiance
directly
to
him
he
wins
land
from
his
neighbors
by
direct
conquest
he
induces
his
neighbor
vassals
to
desert
to
the
better
protection
of
his
suzerainty
he
negotiates
advantageous
marriage
treaties
for
his
relatives
which
bring
new
baronies
into
his
dynasty
when
his
own
suzerain
needs
his
military
aid
beyond
the
orthodox
forty
days
he
sells
his
assistance
for
cash
lands
or
valuable
privileges
then
often
when
such
an
aggressive
seigneur
dies
his
whole
pretentious
fief
crumbles
rapidly
his
eldest
son
is
entitled
to
the
central
castle
and

of

barony
but
not
to
the
whole

and
the

can
not
be

portion

suzerain

all
kinds
of
demands
upon

weakened
heir
so
do

who

concessions
worst
of

nevertheless
commit

by
the
treacherous
way

execute
their
oaths
in
a
few
years
what
has
appeared
a
powerful
fief
under
a
young
or
incapable
baron
seems
on
the
very
edge
of
ruin
its
lord
reduced
to
a
single
castle
with
perhaps
some
question
whether
he
can
defend
even
that
sidenote
accession
to
a
barony
through
such
a
peril
conon
passed
inevitably
when
as
a
very
youthful
knight
he
took
over
the
estates
of
his
unblessed
uncle
only
the
saints
favor
his
mother
wise
counsels
and
his
own
high
looks
and
strong
arm
kept
the
fief
together
but
after
the
vassal
petty
nobles
had
been
duly
impressed
with
the
fact
that
even
if
the
new
baron
were
less
of
a
bloody
tyrant
than
his
predecessor
he
could
storm
a
defiant
fortalice
and
behead
its
rebellious
master
the
barony
settled
down
to
relative
peace
there
was
a
meeting
at
aliquis
of
all
the
vassals
conon
clothed
in
full
armor
then
presented
himself
in
the
great
hall
will
you
have
sire
conon
the
nephew
of
your
late
lord
as
your

undoubted

eustace
the
seneschal
fiat
so
be
it
shouted
all
the
knights
whereat
each
in
turn
did
homage
and
conon
was
now
their
liege
lord
by
every
christian
and
feudal
law
next
conon
himself
visited
the
duke
of
quelqueparte
paid
his
relief
in
turn
did
his
own
homage
and
henceforth
had
his
position
completely
recognized
from
that
time
conon
had
been
obeyed
by
his
vassals
with
reasonable
fidelity
they
had
never
refused
military
service
they
had
fought
round
his
standard
very
faithfully
at
the
great
battle
of
bouvines
they
had
given
him
no
reason
to
doubt
that
if
he
were
hard
bestead
they
would
discharge
the
other
feudal
duties
of
defending
his
person
at
the
hazard
of
their
lives
of
resigning
a
horse
to
him
that
he
might
save
himself
in
a
battle
or
even
of
going
prisoner
for
him
to
secure
his
release
if
he
were
captive
on
the
other
hand
conon
had
earned
their
love
by
proving
himself
a
very
honorable
seigneur
when
his
vassal
sire
leonard
had
died
leaving
only
a
minor
son
he
administered
the
lad
fief
very
wisely
and
gave
it
back
a
little
richer
if
anything
when
the
heir
came
of
age
when
another
vassal
had
fallen
into
a
feud
with
a
neighboring
sire
conon
had
afforded
military
help
although
it
was
not
his
direct
quarrel
he
had
respected
the
wives
and
daughters
of
his
petty
nobles
as
though
they
had
been
his
sisters
in
short
on
aliquis
had
been
almost
realized
that
happy
relation
mentioned
in
the
law
books
the
seigneur
owes
faith
and
loyalty
to
his
as
much
as
the
man
to
his
seigneur
nevertheless
conon
wise
as
a
serpent
but
harmless
as
a
dove
as
father
grégoire
says
pithily
takes
nothing
for
granted
twice
he
has
somewhat
formally
made
the
circuit
of
his
seigneury
stopping
at
each
castle
allowing
each
little
sire
to
show
hospitality
and
then
receiving
again
his
pledges
homage
can
be
done
many
times
the
more
often
it
is
repeated
the
more
likely
it
will
be
effective
your
vassal
who
swore
fealty
last
christmas
is
much
more
likely
to
obey
the
the
call
to
arms
than
he
who
took
his
oath
ten
years
ago
the
aliquis
vassals
have
all
performed
this

and
who
has
waited
for
the
present
fêtes
to
take
his
vows
and
receive
due
investiture
this
ceremony
therefore
takes
place
some
day
after
the
wedding
feast
there
is
nothing
humiliating
therein
for
sire
andré
on
the
contrary
he
is
glad
to

the
first

been
the

the

the

comes

sire
eustace

gives
to

symbolic
token
of

would

some

is
always
required
this

completes
the
ceremony
sire
andré
is
now
in
possession
of
le
chenevert
and
its
lands
and
can
not
be
ousted
thence
so
long
as
he
performs
his
feudal
duties
of
course
if
the
fief
had
been
granted
out
for
the
first
time
or
had
been
transferred
to
some
one
not
a
direct
heir
there
would
be
a
deed
of
conveyance
drafted
in
detail
and
sealed
by
many
ponderous
lumps
of
wax
attached
to
the
parchment
with
strips
of
leather
in
many
cases
however
no
new
document
is
needful
and
indeed
all
through
the
feudal
ages
even
important
bargains
are
likely
often
to
be
determined
merely
by
word
of
mouth
a
reason
for
requiring
many
witnesses
there
is
little
danger
however
of
a
quarrel
between
such
congenial
spirits
as
baron
conon
and
sire
andré
at
its
best
vassalship
is
not
a
state
of
unworthy
dependence
it
is
a
state
of
junior
comradeship
which
without
effacing
distances
created
a
close
relation
of
mutual
devotion
and
if
vassals
are
often
rebellious
vassals
again
and
again
in
history
and
in
story
have
proved
willing
to
lay
down
their
lives
for
their
lord
there
are
few
sentiments
the
jongleurs
can
repeat
in
the
average
castle
with
surer
hope
of
applause
than
when
they
recite
once
more
from
the
epic
of
garin
concerning
the
duke
of
belin
who
declared
that
there
was
something
more
precious
than
all
his
riches
and
power
for
wealth
consists
neither
in
rich
clothes
nor
in
money
nor
in
buildings
nor
in
horses
but
is
made
from
kinsmen
and
the
heart
of
one
man
is
worth
all
the
gold
in
a
country
footnotes
the
right
to
profit
from
certain
beehives
could
constitute
a
fief
or
to
a
fraction
say
of
the
tolls
collected
at
a
certain
bridge
the
emperor
of
the
holy
roman
empire
germany
and
italy
was
usually
acknowledged
as
the
social
and
titular
superior
of
the
king
of
france
but
he
was
never
conceded
any
practical
power
over
frenchmen
sometimes
the
relief
was
also
payable
when
a
new
suzerain
came
in
not
merely
when
the
fief
changed
vassals
in
a
south
country
castle
a
certain
seigneur
was
obligated
if
his
suzerain
the
duke
of
aquitaine
visited
him
to
wait
on
the
table
wearing
himself
scarlet
leggings
with
spurs
of
gold
he
had
to
serve
the
duke
and
ten
knights
with
a
meal
of
pork
beef
cabbage
roast
chickens
and
mustard
many
other
obligations
for
payments
or
rendering
of
hospitality
which
were
equally
curious
could
be
recorded
one
might
describe
the
situation
by
saying
that
many
a
baron
who
would
order
a
stranger
or
captive
to
be
executed
in
cold
blood
without
form
of
trial
would
hesitate
to
have
him
hanged
or
beheaded
save
by
the
hereditary
executioner
of
the
seigneury
who
had
a
vested
right
to
perform
such
nice
matters
what
could
go
on
in
feudal
families
earlier
in
the
eleventh
century
is
illustrated
by
the
tale
of
three
brothers
noblemen
of
angouleme
who
quarreled
two
of
them
treacherously
invited
the
third
to
their
joint
easter
festivities
they
seized
him
in
bed
put
out
his
eyes
and
cut
out
his
tongue
that
he
might
not
denounce
them
the
facts
however
leaked
out
their
suzerain
the
duke
of
aquitaine
ravaged
their
lands
with
fire
and
sword
thus
ruining
their
innocent
peasants
took
the
two
criminals
and
cut
out
their
own
tongues
and
put
out
their
eyes
in
retaliation
the
absence
of
a
strict
rule
of
primogeniture
in
france
and
other
continental
countries
added
much
to
the
complexities
of
the
whole
feudal
regime
homage
may
be
likened
somewhat
to
in
a
later
day
the
more
recently
performed
the
greater
its
effectiveness
chapter
x
justice
and
punishments
one
of
the
great
duties
of
a
high
seigneur
is
to
render
justice
it
is
for
that
say
learned
men
that
god
grants
to
him
power
over
thousands
of
villeins
and
the
right
to
obedience
from
nobles
of
the
lower
class
indeed
it
can
be
written
most
properly
that
a
good
baron
is
bound
to
hear
and
determine
the
cause
and
pleas
of
his
subjects
to
ordain
to
every
man
his
own
to
put
forth
his
shield
of
righteousness
to
defend
the
innocent
against
evildoers
and
deliver
small
children
and
such
as
be
orphans
and
widows
from
those
that
do
overset
them
he
pursues
robbers
raiders
thieves
and
other
evildoers

this

is
a
name
of
peace
and

and
reconciles

that
are
at
strife
and
so
under
a

and
peaceable
lord
men
of
the
country
are
safe
the
best
of
barons
only
measurably
live
up
to
this
high
standard
yet
conon
is
not
wholly
exceptional
in
telling
himself
that
a
reputation
for
enforcing
justice
is
in
the
end
a
surer
glory
than
all
the
fêtes
around
aliquis
justice
of
course
does
not
mean
equality
before
the
law
there
is
one
legal
measure
for
country
villeins
another
for
citizens
of
the
commune
another
for
petty
nobles
another
for
greater
nobles
of
conon
own
rank
the
monks
and
priests
can
always
plead
their
clergy
and
get
their
cases
transferred
to
a
special
church
tribunal
the
question
really
is
has
a
man
been
given
everything
due
to
others
of
his
own
class
if
not
there
is
denial
of
justice
the
laws
enforced
in
the
aliquis
region
are
the
old
customary
laws
in
use
ever
since
the
frankish
barbarians
invasions
many
of
these
laws
have
never
been
reduced
to
writing
at
least
for
local
purposes
but
sage
men
know
them
there
are
no
professional
jurists
in
the
barony
sire
eustace
the
seneschal
understands
the
regional
law
better
than
any
other
layman
around
the
castle
though
he
in
turn
is
surpassed
by
father
grégoire
the
latter
has
indeed
a
certain
knowledge
of
the
canon
law
of
the
church
far
more
elaborate
than
any
local
territorial
system
and
he
has
even
turned
over
voluminous
parchments
of
the
old
roman
law
codified
by
the
mighty
emperor
justinian
up
at
paris
round
the
king
there
are
now
trained
lawyers
splitters
of
fine
hairs
who
say
that
this
roman
law
is
far
more
desirable
than
any
local
customary
law
and
they
are
even
endeavoring
as
the
king
extends
his
power
to
make
the
code
of
justinian
the
basis
for
the
entire
law
of
france
but
conditions
on
most
baronies
are
still
pretty
simple
the
questions
to
be
settled
call
merely
for
common
sense
and
a
real
love
of
fair
play
on
the
part
of
the
judges
one
can
live
prosperously
and
die
piously
under
laws
administered
with
great
informality
sidenote
high
and
low
justice
conon
has
high
justice
over
his
vassals
and
peasants
this
means
absolute
power
of
life
and
death
over
any
on
the
seigneury
unless
indeed
the
baron
should
outrage
merchants
bound
to
a
privileged
free
city
or
some
other
wayfarers
under
the
specific
protection
of
the
king
or
the
duke
of
quelqueparte
if
strange
noblemen
get
into
trouble
it
will
depend
on
circumstances
whether
conon
undertakes
to
handle
their
cases
himself
or
refers
them
to
his
suzerain
the
duke
the
right
of
seigneurs
to
powers
of
justice
on
their
own
lands
even
over
high
nobles
is
however
tenaciously
affirmed
and
it
is
only
with
difficulty
the
duke
and
above
him
the
king
can
get
some
cases
remitted
to
their
tribunals
if
however
the
alleged
offender
is
a
monk
he
will
be
handed
over
to
the
local
abbot
or
if
a
priest
to
the
bishop
of
pontdebois
to
be
dealt
with
according
to
the
law
of
the
church
even
the
lesser
sires
have
low
justice
with
the
privilege
of
clapping
villeins
in
the
stocks
flogging
and
imprisoning
for
a
considerable
time
for
minor
offenses
and
robbers
caught
on
their
lands
in
the
act
of
crime
can
be
executed
summarily
but
serious
cases
have
to
go
to
the
court
of
the
baron
as
high
justiciar
as
well
as
all
the
petty
cases
which
have
arisen
on
that
lord
personal
dominions
if
the
litigants
are
peasants
the
wheels
of
justice
move
very
rapidly
there
is
a
decided
absence
of
formalities
a
great
many
disputes
go
before
the
provost
court
presided
over
by
sire
macaire
a
knight
of
the
least
exalted
class
who
is
conon
first
provost
we
shall
see
later
how
the
baron
provosts
practically
control
the
life
of
the
peasants
one
of
sire
main
duties
is
to
chase
down
offenders
acting
as
a
kind
of
sheriff
and
after
that
to
try
them
among
the
brawling
brutal
peasantry
there
is
always
a
deplorable
amount
of
crime
the
seigneury
has
been
blessed
with
a
comparative
absence
of
bandits
but
ever
and
anon
a
pontdebois
merchant
gets
stripped
a
girl
is
carried
off
into
the
woods
or
even
the
body
of
a
traveler
is
found
by
the
roadside
all
this
renders
sire
macaire
office
no
sinecure
small
penalties
are
handed
down
every
day
but
more
serious
matters
must
wait
for
those
intervals
when
messire
conon
calls
his
noble
vassals
to
his
plaids
or
assizes
every
fief
holder
is
expected
to
come
and
to
give
his
lord
good
counsel
as
to
what
ought
to
be
done
especially
if
any
of
the
litigants
are
noble
and
also
to
give
him
material
aid
if
needs
be
in
executing
the
decision
reached
this
last
is
very
important
for
if
a
fief
holder
is
dissatisfied
with
a
verdict
he
has
a
technical
right
to
declare
the
decision
unjust
and
demand
that
it
be
settled
by
ordeal
of
battle
the
duel
not
being
between
the
defeated
suitor
and
his
adversary
but
between
this
suitor
and
his
judge
all
men
know
of
what
happened
according
to
the
song
of
roland
in
the
case
of
the
traitor
ganelon
this
scoundrel
who
had
betrayed
his
suzerain
charlemagne
and
had
caused
the
brave
roland
death
was
seized
by
the
emperor
but
he
demanded
judgment
by
his
peers
charlemagne
could
not
deny
this
claim
he
convoked
the
high
barons
whereupon
lord
pinabel
ganelon
kinsman
announced
that
he
would
give
the
lie
with
the
sword
to
any
seigneur
who
voted
for
punishment
all
the
barons
were
afraid
pinabel
was
a
mighty
warrior
they
reported
an
acquittal
to
charlemagne
the
mighty
emperor
raged
but
felt
helpless
until
he
discovered
the
brave
knight
thierry
of
anjou
who
boldly
asserted
that
ganelon
deserves
death
sidenote
ordeal
by
battle
instantly
pinabel
strode
forward
and
cried
to
the
assize
of
nobles
i
say
that
thierry
has
lied
i
will
fight
and
at
once
charlemagne
took
pledges
from
both
champions
that
they
would
stand
the
ordeal
each
warrior
then
promptly
went
to
mass
partook
of
the
sacrament
and
bestowed
great
gifts
on
the
monasteries
next
they
met
in
mortal
combat
after
a
desperate
duel
thierry
smote
his
foe
through
the
nasal
of
the
helmet
and
therewith
the
brain
of
pinabel
went
gushing
from
his
head
there
was
no
appeal
from
that
verdict
well
content
charlemagne
immediately
caused
ganelon
to
be
pulled
asunder
by
four
fierce
stallions
however
these
noble
usages
are
falling
into
decadence
certes
it
is
an
unknightly
thing
when
both
litigants
are
young
cavaliers
evenly
matched
and
when
the
issue
concerns
honor
rather
than
legal
technicalities
for
them
to
insist
that
the
matter
be
settled
merely
by
a
peaceful
verdict
as
if
they
had
been
wrangling
merchants
but
the
church
the
men
of
books
and
the
higher
suzerains
discourage
this
practice
especially
when
the
cases
are
intricate
and
one
of
the
litigants
can
not
fight
efficiently
or
provide
a
champion
as
for
challenging
a
judge
after
a
disagreeable
verdict
the
thing
is
becoming
dangerous
for
all
the
other
judges
will
feel
bound
to
support
him
the
most
likely
happening
is
for
the
defeated
litigant
to
retire
to
his
castle
summon
his
followers
and
defy
the
court
to
enforce
its
verdict
this
happened
with
a
sire
of
the
court
of
trabey
a
neighbor
of
conon
said
sire
having
been
ordered
by
his
peers
to
give
up
a
manor
he
had
been
withholding
from
his
young
nephew
sent
a
pursuivant
before
their
tribunal
formally
declaring
war
the
entire
seigneury
had
to
arm
and
actually
storm
his
castle
before
he
would
submit
however
most
aliquis
cases
concern
not
the
nobles
but
only
villeins
and
with
these
thanks
be
to
heaven
short
shrifts
are
permitted
the
provost
can
handle
the
run
of
crimes
when
the
baron
is
busy
but
a
good
seigneur
acts
as
his
own
judge
if
possible
even
during
the
festival
period
it
is
needful
for
conon
to
put
aside
his
pleasures
one
morning
to
mount
the
seat
of
justice
in
wintertime
the
tribunal
is
of
course
in
the
great
hall
but
in
such
glorious
weather
a
big

in
the

is
far
preferable
here
the

a

an

the

that

really
covets

farm
if
the
court
decisions
are
not
so
wise
as
solomon
they
are
speedy
and
probably
represent
substantial
justice
but
there
is
more
serious
business
in
hand
the

have
discovered
their
chance
certain
discharged
mercenary
soldiers
have
actually
invaded
a
village
stolen
the
peasants
corn
pigs
and
chickens
insulted
their
women
and
crowned
their
deeds
by
firing
many
cottages
and
setting
upon
three
jongleurs
bound
for
the
tourney
they
were
in
the
very
act
of
robbing
them
to
their
skin
when
a
party
of
the
provost
men
coming
up
managed
to
seize
two
of
these
sturdy
rascals
sire
macaire
has
also
arrested
a
young
peasant
who
stabbed
an
older
farmer
painfully
while
they
wrangled
over
a
calf
this
second
case
is
settled
summarily
the
defendant
is
of
bad
reputation
he
must
stand
all
day
in
the
pillory
and
then
to
be
branded
on
his
forehead
with
a
iron
that
all
men
may
beware
of
him
as
for
the
alleged
bandits
the
case
is
not
so
simple
they
keep
a
sullen
silence
and
refuse
to
betray
the
lair
of
their
comrades
who
have
escaped
the
provost
intimates
that
they
may
be
and
outlaws
of
the
foulest
type
said
to
violate
tombs
and
devour
human
flesh
very
possibly
they
may
have
belonged
to
that
notorious
gang
of
brigands
many
of
which
king
philip
lured
inside
the
walls
of
bourges
then
closed
the
gates
and
slew
them
thus
capturing
all
their
plunder
such
fellows
are
of
course
food
for
the
crows
but
they
must
not
be
allowed
to
get
out
of
life
too
easily
let
the
baron
command
preparatory
torture
suggests
sire
macaire
with
a
sinister
smile
conon
nods
the
two
beastlike
wretches
groan
and
strain
at
their
fetters
preparatory
torture
they
know
well
is
inflicted
both
to
get
a
confession
of
guilt
and
also
to
extort
details
about
accomplices
it
is
no
pleasure
to
follow
the
provost
his
guards
and
his
prisoners
to
a
certain
tower
where
in
a
lower
vaulted
room
there
are
various
iron
and
wooden
instruments
we
are
given
to
understand
that
torture
is
a
pretty
usual
part
of
criminal
proceedings
unless
the
defendant
is
a
noble
whose
alleged
crime
does
not
touch
the
safety
of
the
state
it
is
true
that
wise
men
have
discouraged
the
practice
what
seems
clearer
than
that
which
pope
nicholas
i
wrote
a
confession
must
be
voluntary
and
not
forced
by
means
of
torture
an
innocent
man
may
suffer
to
the
uttermost
without
making
any
avowal
in
such
a
case
what
a
crime
for
the
judge
or
a
person
may
be
subdued
by
pain
and
acknowledge
himself
guilty
though
he
be
innocent
which
throws
an
equally
great
sin
upon
the
tribunal
nevertheless
the
church
is
said
now
to
be
allowing
torture
in
her
own
ecclesiastical
courts
and
sire
macaire
would
tell
us
cynically
that
torture
is
a
sovereign
means
wherewith
to
work
miracles
to
make
the
dumb
speak
torture
at
aliquis
is
administered
by
a
man
in
a
curious
yellow
dress
he
is
known
as
maître
denis
the
sworn
executioner
he
acts
as
torturer
chief
jailer
and
also
attends
to
beheadings
and
hangings
to
be
a
professional
hangman
implies
considerable
ostracism
hangmen
families
have
to
marry
among
themselves
between
fief
and
fief
hangmen
sons
follow
their
calling
on
the
other
hand
the
position
is
an
assured
one
with
good
perquisites
and
not
too
much
labor
maître
denis
is
a
quiet
and
pious
man
who
can
exhort
condemned
criminals
quite
as
sanctimoniously
as
a
priest
but
his
piety
never
compels
him
to
false
mercy
sidenote
varieties
of
tortures
there
are
assuredly
many
ways
of
helping
transgressors
to
make
a
complete
confession
forms
of
torture
vary
from
region
to
region
in
brittany
the
culprit
is
often
tied
in
an
iron
chair
and
gradually
brought
near
to
a
blazing
fire
but
in
normandy
the
effect
seems
best
when
one
thumb
is
squeezed
by
a
kind
of
screw
in
the
ordinary
and
both
thumbs
in
the
extraordinary
doubly
severe
torture
at
autun
they
have
an
ingenious
method
after
high
boots
of
spongy
leather
have
been
put
on
the
culprit
feet
he
is
tied
near
a
large
fire
and
boiling
water
is
poured
on
the
boots
which
penetrates
the
leather
eats
away
the
flesh
and
vouchsafes
a
foretaste
of
the
pangs
of
hell
at
orléans
they
have
another
method
the
accused
hands
are
tied
behind
his
back
and
a
ring
fastened
to
them
by
this
ring
the
unhappy
fellow
is
lifted
from
the
floor
and
hung
up
in
midair
if
they
then
desire
the
extraordinary
torture
weights
of
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
are
attached
to
his
feet
he
is
hoisted
to
the
ceiling
by
a
pulley
and
presently
allowed
to
fall
with
a
jerk
dislocating
his
limbs
there
are
indeed
many
simpler
more
convenient
methods
of
torture
you
can
inject
boiling
water
vinegar
or
oil
into
the
accused
apply
hot
pitch
place
hot
eggs
under
the
armpits
thrust
dice
between
the
skin
and
flesh
tie
lighted
candles
to
the
hands
so
that
they
can
be
consumed
simultaneously
with
the
wax
or
allow
water
to
drip
from
a
great
height
upon
the
stomach
this
curiously
enough
is
said
to
break
down
the
most
stubborn
criminals
as
will
watering
the
soles
of
the
feet
with
salted
water
and
allowing
goats
to
lick
the
same
however
the
ordinary
method
is
the
rack
then
the
offender
is
laid
on
a
wooden
trestle
cords
are
bound
to
his
limbs
and
then
steadily
tightened
with
winches
baron
garnier
in
his
day
took
great
interest
in
obtaining
a
rack
it
now
is
put
to
proper
use
in
stretching
the
two
brigands
happily
these
culprits
break
down
after
the
first
of
them
has
undergone
a
few
turns
before
his
limbs
are
dislocated
and
to
the
provost
satisfaction
they
howl
out
sundry
details
as
to
how
their
comrades
can
be
taken
the
prisoners
are
therefore
remanded
to
custody
until
their
statements
can
be
investigated
woe
to
them
if
they
have
lied
in
that
event
there
are
promised
them
much
keener
tortures
to
make
them
weary
of
life
while
sire
macaire
is
therefore
leading
his
band
after
the
remaining
brigands
maître
denis
conducts
the
two
captives
back
to
prison
really
it
is
only
a
few
feet
from
the
great
hall
of
state
in
the
to
the
cells
under
the
old
donjon
in
their
confinement
the
prisoners
can
hear
the
revelry
of
the
baron
guests
through
their
airholes
drifts
the
jongleur

they
can
almost
at
times
catch
the
swish
and
rustle
of
the
rich
dresses
of
the
noblewomen
conon

accounted
a
merciful
custodian
compared
with
his
uncle
but
he
does
not
let

their
sins
because
of
kindness
sidenote
prisoners
and
dungeons
noble
prisoners
are
entitled
to
relatively
comfortable
quarters
to
double
rations
of
decent
food
to
give
bail
if
their
alleged
offense
is
not
a
very
heavy
one
and
to
be
released
on
reasonable
ransom
if
they
are
captives
of
war
villeins
have
no
such
privileges
they
are
fortunate
if
first
they
are
not
stripped
naked
as
a
pair
of
tongs
before
the
lock
rattles
behind
them
they
are
usually
cast
into
filthy
holes
sometimes
with
water
running
across
the
floor
and
with
reptiles
breeding
in
the
mire
in
paris
where
the
king
is
considered
more
than
the
average
seigneur
we
hear
of
a
cell
of
only
eleven
by
seven
feet
in
which
ten
people
have
been
thrust
to
spend
the
night
of
course
these
were
not
great
criminals
the
latter
might
enjoy
the
d
where
a
man
had
his
feet
continually
in
water
or
the
a
round
chamber
let
into
the
bowels
of
the
rock
into
which
prisoners
must
be
lowered
by
a
pulley
from
the
ceiling
or
a
chamber
where
one
could
neither
sit
nor
stand
if
however
you
have
money
you
can
sometimes
bribe
the
turnkeys
into
letting
you
have
a
cell
more
private
and
less
noisome
with
the
luxury
of
bedding
and
a
chair
but
in
any
case
he
who
enters
a
feudal
prison
had
better
invoke
his
patron
saint
maître
denis
has
not
treated
the
two
brigands
quite
so
badly
as
lay
in
his
power
he
has
left
them
their
clothes
since
they
are
sure
to
be
executed
and
he
can
get
the
raiment
later
he
has
not
put
them
in
the
where
baron
garnier
had
sometimes
dropped
his
victims
because
of
the
trouble
later
of
hoisting
them
out
he
gives
them
coarse
bread
and
some
meat
not
unfit
for
dogs
at
the
same
time
advising
them
on
his
word
as
a
christian
to
confer
with
father
grégoire
the
miserable
pair
are
not
long
uncertain
about
their
fate
they
have
told
the
truth
about
the
lair
of
their
comrades
the
provost
band
surprises
the
spot
six
hardened
rogues
in
the
very
act
of
counting
their
plunder
are
overpowered
but
why
weary
messire
the
baron
with
the
empty
form
of
trying
these
robbers
when
there
is
no
mortal
doubt
of
their
guilt
and
no
new
information
is
to
be
extracted
from
them
their
throats
are
therefore
cut
as
unceremoniously
as
the
cook
boy
attends
to
pigeons
the
next
day
wholly
casually
sire
macaire
reports
his
good
success
to
his
lord
and
remarks
i
presume
fair
sire
that
denis
can
hang
the
two
he
has
in
the
dungeon
conon
just
arranging
a
hawking
party
rejoins
as
soon
as
the
chaplain
can
shrive
them
why
again
should
the
prisoners
complain
they
are
certainly
allowed
to
prepare
decently
for
the
next
world
a
favor
entirely
denied
their
comrades
if
there
had
been
any
real
doubt
as
to
the
guilt
of
the
two
bandits
they
might
in
desperation
have
tried
to
clear
themselves
by
if
they
could
have
picked
a
stone
out
of
a
caldron
of
boiling
water
lifted
and
carried
a
iron
or
even
partaken
of
the
holy
sacrament
first
calling
on
god
to
strike
them
dead
if
they
were
guilty
and
after
such
a
test
seemed
none
the
worse
they
might
have
had
some
claim
to
go
free
are
an
old
germanic
usage
they
seem
to
refer
the
decision
to
god
but
ever
since
charlemagne
day
they
have
been
falling
into
disfavor
great
churchmen
are
ordinarily
too
intelligent
to
encourage
them
men
learned
in
the
law
say
that
often
they
wrest
justice
brave
knights
declare
the
only
ordeal
worth
having
is
a
duel
between
two
champions
sidenote
ordeals
the
pillory
and
flogging
sometimes
instead
of
wrangling
clerics
have
undertaken
to
prove
themselves
right
by
passing
through
fire
walking
down
a
narrow
lane
between
two
great
piles
of
blazing
fagots
and
trusting
that
heaven
will
guard
them
even
as
it
did
the
three
hebrew
children
in
nebuchadnezzar
furnace
such
tests
seldom
are
satisfactory
men
still
dispute
about
the
ordeal
of
the
monk
peter
barthelmey
during
the
first
crusade
he
was
accused
of
a
pretended
miracle
and
tried
to
vindicate
himself
by
passing
through
fire
alive
all
agreed
that
he
emerged
from
the
flames
alive
yet
in
a
few
days
he
died
his
foes
said
because
he
was
sorely
burned
his
friends
because
although
unscathed
by
the
fire
he
was
merely
trampled
upon
by
the
crowd
that
rushed
up
to
discover
his
fate
the
only
time
one
can
ordinarily
rely
upon
ordeals
is
in
tests
for
witchcraft
if
an
old
woman
is
so
accused
she
must
be
tied
hand
and
foot
and
cast
into
the
river
if
she
floats
the
devil
is
aiding
draw
her
out
therefore
and
burn
her
at
the
stake
if
she
sinks
as
in
a
case
recently
at
pontdebois
she
is
innocent
unfortunately
in
this
instance
the
poor
wretch
went
to
the
bottom
before
they
could
determine
that
she
was
guiltless
but
the
saints
know
their
own
and
doubtless
they
have
given
recompense
and
rest
to
her
soul
naturally
many
petty
offenses
do
not
deserve
death
the
criminals
are
usually
too
poor
to
pay
fines
and
it
is
a
waste
of
honest
folk
bread
to
let
them
spend
set
terms
in
prison
for
small
misdemeanants
it
is
often
enough
to
drive
the
rascals
around
the
neighboring
villages
in
a
cart
calling
out
their
names
amid
hootings
and
showers
of
offal
but
in
the
village
beyond
the
claire
is
located
the
pillory
for
a
large
class
of
rogues
it
is
a
kind
of
high
scaffold
with
several
sets
of
chains
and
wooden
collars
through
which
the
offenders
arms
and
heads
are
thrust
while
they
stand
for
hours
in
hot
sun
or
winter
cold
exposed
to
the
jeerings
and
pebbles
of
the
assembled
idlers
gathered
beneath
the
next
stage
of
penalty
is
sometimes
a
public
flogging
the
prisoner
is
stripped
to
the
waist
and
driven
around
the
seigneury
at
each
crossroads
his
guards
give
so
many
blows
over
the
shoulders
with
a
knotted
rope
we
have
seen
how
branding
was
ordered
for
one
young
miscreant
to
put
on
him
an
ineffaceable
stigma
and
not
infrequently
one
can
meet
both
men
and
women
with
a
hand
lopped
off
or
even
an
eye
gouged
out
as
a
merciful
substitute
for
their
true
deserts
upon
the
gallows
old
baron
garnier
once
when
peculiarly
incensed
ordered
the
hot
bowl
namely
that
a
brazier
should
be
passed
before
the
eyes
of
his
victim
until
sight
was
destroyed
but
if
a
villein
has
committed
a
great
crime
he
were
best
dismissed
from
an
overtroubled
world
dead
men
never
bother
the
provost
twice
all
over
france
you
will
find
a
gallows
almost
as
common
a
sight
in
the
landscape
as
a
castle
an
abbey
or
a
village
many
a
fine
spreading
tree
by
the
roadway
has
a
skeleton
from
one
of
its
limbs
it
is
a
lucky
family
of
peasants
which
has
not
had
some
member
thereof
hanged
and
even
then
plenty
of
rogues
will
die
in
their
beds
considering
the
general
wickedness
abroad
it
seems
as
if
there
were
a
perpetual
race
between
the
criminals
and
the
hangmen
with
the
criminals
well
to
the
fore
sidenote
the
public
gallows
there
are
almost
as
many
forms
of
execution
as
there
are
of
torture
fearful
criminals
gross
blasphemers
and
the
like
might
be
killed
by
quartering
first
their
flesh
might
be
nipped
off
by
pinchers
and
hot
lead
poured
into
their
wounds
then
death
comes
as
a
release
by
attaching
a
strong
horse
to
each
arm
and
leg
and
tearing
the
victim
into
four
parts
witches
wizards
and
heretics
are
of
course
burned
because
they
thus
share
the
element
of
their
patron
the
devil
most
malefactors
however
find
beheading
or
hanging
the
ordinary
ending
beheading
is
honorable
it
is
the
nobleman
expiation
for
misdeeds
the
victim
is
not
degraded
and
leaves
no
stigma
upon
his
children
in
england
the
headsman
uses
the
ax
but
in
france
he
ordinarily
swings
a
great
sword
a
skillful
executioner
does
his
business
at
one
blow
a
most
merciful
form
of
mortal
exit
hanging
however
is
dishonorable
nobles
who
have
especially
exasperated
their
judges
are
sometimes
subjected
to
it
henceforth
people
will
cry
their
father
was
a
felon
to
their
disgraced
children
when
a
villein
is
ordered
to
die
he
is
ordinarily
hanged
unless
some
other
method
is
specified
in
the
village
near
aliquis
the
gallows
is
near
the
pillory
it
is
not
so
large
as
that
huge
gallows
at
montfaucon
near
paris
which
sees
the
end
of
so
many
of
the
city
offenders
and
where
there
is
a
great
series
of
stone
piers
with
wooden
crosspieces
arranged
in
two
stories
making
compartments
in
all
there
are
permanent
ladders
fixed
for
dragging
up
the
criminals
when
all
the
compartments
are
full
and
additional
room
is
needed
for
more
executions
some
of
the
skeletons
are
thrown
into
a
deep
hideous
pit
in
the
center
of
the
structure
the
less
pretentious
aliquis
gallows
has
only
four
compartments
the
structure
stands
close
to
the
road
that
all
may
learn
how
energetic
are
the
provosts
two
compartments
are
now
empty
however
and
sire
macaire
is
glad
of
a
chance
to
fill
them
because
the
two
bandits
made
prompt
confession
they
are
not
subjected
now
to
a
previous
torture
that
is
to
a
new
racking
as
an
extra
punishment
before
execution
they
are
compelled
however
to
perform
the
this
involves
being
haled
to

and
because
of
the
risks
of
acting

this
feudal
obligation
was
often
poorly
discharged
it
was
clearly
recognized
also
that
the

of

was
subject
to
abuses
and
successful
efforts
were
made
to
limit
it

this
method
of

seems
to
have
been
the
one
ordinarily
used
in
the
inquisition
which
began
its
unhappy
history
in
the
thirteenth
century
this
was
one
of
the
famous
chambers
of
forgetfulness

cells
where
the
prisoners
could
be
left
to
starve
in
pitch
darkness
or
perhaps
be
fed
by
a
few
scraps
flung
down
from
the
hole
in
the
vaulting
it
was
a
great
concession
in
the
paris
prisons
when
the
government
ordered
that
the
jailers
in
the
more
public
wards
should
keep
large
basins
on
the
pavement
so
that
the
prisoners
might
get

they
wished

the
terrible
severity
of
the
penalties
made
many
persons
who
were
guilty
of
relatively
small

feel
that
they
had

him
this

gave
him
a

just
as
aimery
was
about
to
demand
knighthood

latter
suddenly
died

therefore
returned

the
one

for
true
he
has
been

he
understands
it
is
well
that
god
has
created
priests
and
monks
who
may
by
their
ceremonies
and
prayers
enable
the
good
warriors
to
enter
into

has
never
had
the
slightest
desire
to
become
a

he
thanks
his
divine
patroness
génevieve
that
conon
has
not
treated
him
as
so

are

aimery
has
learned
to
attend
mass
devoutly

to
accept
implicitly
the

of
the
priests
but
his
moral
training
is
almost
entirely
based

secular

indeed
hence
he
acts
on
the
advice
given
him

very
young
honor
all
churchmen

look
well
to
your
money
another
warning
is
never
to
put
trust
in
villeins
he
can
not
indeed
refuse
to
deal
with
them
he
must
treat
them
ordinarily
with
decency
but
never
trust
them

aimery

training
in

it
is
true
that
many

can
not
read
a

on
the

which
their
scriveners
interpret
draw
up

that

could
delve

told
him
of

was
fencing
with
a
blunted

from

took

lessons
first
from

then
from

professional
master
a

hired
by

equally
early
he
had
his
horse
his
hawks
and
his
dogs
he
was
taught
how
to
care
for
them
entirely
himself
and
was
soon
allowed
to
go
on
long
rides
alone
into
the
dense
forest
in
order
to
develop
his
resourcefulness
sense
of
direction
and

over

of

aimery
in
the
de
bernon
castle
surely
received
his
full
share
of
discipline
not
merely
from
the
count
but
from
the
two
older
squires
who
took
pains
at
first
to
tyrannize
over
him
unmercifully
until
they
became
knighted
and
he
gained
two
new
companions
younger
than
himself
with
whom
he
played
the
despot
in
turn
in
his
master
service
aimery
became
expert
in
the
use
of
arms
first
he
was
allowed
to
carry
the
count
great
sword
lance
and
shield
and
to
learn
how
the
older
nobles
could
handle
them
next
he
was
given
weapons
and
mail
of
his
own
and
began
the
tedious
training
of
the
tilt
yard
discovering
that
a
large
part
of
his
happiness
in
life
would
consist
in
being
able
to
hold
his
lance
steady
while
his
horse
was
charging
to
strike
the
point
fairly
on
a
hostile
shield
until
either
the
tough
lance
snapped
or
his
foe
was
flung
from
the
saddle
and
at
the
same
time
to
pinch
his
own
saddle
tightly
with
his
knees
while
with
his
own
shield
covering
breast
and
head
against
a
mortal
blow

he
must
practice
it

meantime
he
was
attending
the

as
a
constant
companion
he
rose
at
gray
dawn
went
to
the
stables
and
curried
down
his
master

horse
then
back
to
the
castle
to

his
superior
to
dress

waited
on
his

at
table
he
was

for
receiving
noble
guests
preparing
their
chambers
and
generally
attending
to
their
comfort
on
expeditions
he
led
the
count
great

charger
when
the
seigneur
rode
his
less
fiery
palfrey
and
he
would
pass
his
lord
his
weapons
as
needed
at
tournaments
he
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
lists
ready
to
rush
in
and
rescue
the
count
from
under
the
stamping
horses
if
he
were
dismounted
he
was
expected
to
fight
only
in
emergencies
when
his
master
was
in
great
danger
but
bernon
was
a
gallant
knight
and
repeatedly
in
hot
forays
aimery
had
gained
the
chance
to
use
his
weapons
at
the
same
time
he
was
learning
courtesy
he
was
intrusted
with
the
escort
of
the
countess
and
her
daughters
he
entertained
with
games
jests
and
songs
noble
dames
visiting
the
castle
he
learned
all
the
details
of
his
master
affairs
the

was
supposed
to
treat
him
as
a
kind
of
younger

intrust
him
with
secrets
send
him
as
confidential
messenger
on
delicate
business
allow
him
to
carry
his
purse
when
he
journeyed
and
keep
the
keys
to
his
coffers
when
at
home
after
aimery
became
first
squire
he
was
expected
also
to
assist
the
seneschal
in
a
last
round
of
the
castle
at
night
to
make
sure
everything
was
locked
and
guarded
then
he
would
sleep
at
the
door
of
the
count
chamber
beyond
a
doubt
since
the
count
was
an
honorable
and
capable
man
aimery
received
thereby
a
training
of
enormous
value
while
still
a
lad
he
had
large
responsibilities
thrust
upon
him
and
learned
how
to
transmit
commands
and
to
handle
difficult
situations
he
was
versed
in
all
the
ordinary
occasions
of
a
nobleman
when
he
became
a
knight
himself
he
would

for

harder
after

could
strike

took

never

he
forget
the
grinding

of
the

splintering
upon

almost
irresistible

that
seemed
smiting
him

his

was
almost
unhorsed
when
they
tried

friendly
course
by

aimery
completed
his
education
if
he
has
failed
to
learn
humility
humanity
to
villeins
and
that
high
respect
for
women
which
treats
them
not
merely
as
creatures
to
be
praised
and
courted
but
as
one
moral
and
intellectual
equals
he
at
least
has
learned
a
high
standard
of
honor
in
dealing
with
his
fellow
nobles
the
confidences
his
master
has
reposed
in
him
have
made
it
a
fundamental
conviction
that
it
were
better
to
perish
a
dozen
times
than
to
betray
a
trust
he
believes
that
the
word
of
a
cavalier
should
be
better
than
the
oath
of
the
ignoble
as
for
courage
it
were
better
to
die
like
ganelon
torn
by
wild
horses
than
to
show
fear
in
the
face
of
physical
danger
he
has
been
trained
also
to
cultivate
the
virtue
of
generosity
to
an
almost
ruinous
extent
free
giving
is
one
of
the
marks
of
a
true
nobleman
largess
is
praised
by
the
minstrels
almost
as
much
as
bravery
he
is
not
a
true
knight
who
is
too
covetous
therefore
money
is
likely
to
flow
like
water
through
aimery
fingers
all
his
life
the
one
redeeming
fact
will
be
that
though
he
will
be
constantly
he
will
always
be
as
constantly
among
the
nobles
there
is
an
incessant
exchanging
of
gifts
horses

even

all

really
comes
from

yet
their
lords
dispose
carelessly
of

they
do
not

however
will
complain
if
their

do
not

may
be

even
if

of
nobility
can

knighthood
ordinarily
implies
having
a
minimum
of
landed
property
and
ability
to
live
in
aristocratic
idleness
many
poor
nobles
and
especially
the
younger
sons
of
poor
nobles
remain
bachelors
fretting
upon
their
starving
properties
or
serving
some
seigneur
as
mercenaries
and
hoping
for
a
stroke
of
fortune
so
that
they
can
demand
knighthood

they
are
likely
to
die
in

on

there
are

seigneurs
who
although
rich
and
dubbed
as
knights
nevertheless
give
the
lie
to
their
honors
by
their
effeminacy
and
luxury
they
are
worse
than

we
saw
as

such
unworthy
knights
unquestionably
can
be
found
but
they
have
not

whole
nobility
your
average
cavalier
has
spent
his
entire
life
training
for
combat
he
dreams
of
lance
thrusts
and
forays
and
the
least
of
his
sins
is
that
he
will
shun
deadly
blows

to
generalize
as
to
the

modern
students
would
probably
represent
them
as
being

better

sharp
distinction
between
the
young
attendants
known
as

and
the
older
squires
had
hardly
been
worked
out
by
such
young
persons
could
also
be
called
varlets
but
that
name
might
be
given
as
well
to
servitors
when
chivalry
was
at
its
height
the
theory
developed
that
a
nobleman
son
should
spend
his
first
to
his
seventh
year
at
home
with
his
mother
his
eighth
to
his
fifteenth
in
suitable
training
as
a
page
and
from
that
time
till
he
was
serving
as
a
squire
this
precise
demarcation
of
time
was
probably
seldom
adhered
to
many
ambitious
young
nobles
would
serve
much
less
than
seven
years
as
a
squire
on
the
other
hand
many
petty
nobles
might
remain
squires
all
their
lives
for
lack
of
means
to

made

after
all
his

is
material

how

that
gives
him
much
of
his

a

part
of
the

comes
from
his

him
often
to
go

they

the
order

get
ready
for

charge

after
a
knight
is
wounded
the
first
friendly
act
is
to
unlace
his
headpiece
by
the
early
thirteenth
century
helmets
are
beginning
to
have
closed
visors
to
keep
out
missiles
but
these
visors
are
immovable
without
taking
off
the
whole
helm
and
if
they
get
displaced
and
the
small
eyeholes
are
shifted
the
wearer
is
practically
blind
the
open
helm
will
therefore
continue
in
vogue

coming

been
improving

one
can
not
trust
solely
to

a
kind

the
average
weapon
is
about
three
inches
wide

the

should
be

candidates
back
in
the
castle
aimery
is
glad
of
an
unusually
hearty
breakfast
not
merely
has
the
long
vigil
of
standing
wearied
him
but
he
will
need
all
his
strength
for
the
ordeal
of
the
day
next
he
goes
to
his
chamber
where
the
stripling
who
is
to
be
his
squire
the
son
of
a
friendly
baron
puts
on
his
new
master
gala
dress
white
is
the
predominant
color
whiter
than
the
snow
of
the
april
flowers
friends
of
his
brother
come
in
to
witness
the
process
and
compliment
the
candidate
very
openly
upon
his
broad
shoulders
healthy
complexion
and
hardened
sinews
these
congratulations
become
more
pronounced
when
a
bustling
servitor
announces
that
all
is
ready
aimery
strides
into
the
courtyard
the
place
seems
crammed
with
knights
and
dames
old
and
young
all
in
their
best
everybody
partly
from
politeness
partly
from
genuine
enthusiasm
begins
to
call
out
how
fine
he
is
a
true
aliquis
right
worthy
of
his
brother
immediately
two
loud
trumpets
announce
the
ceremony
a
great
orchestra
of
jongleurs
raises
a
clamor
the
sight
is
magnificent
the
castle
court
seems
alive
with
color
the
women
are
in
striking
costumes
with
their
long
hair
hanging
braided
on
their
shoulders
the
knights
wear
either
bliauts
green
blue
or
red
or
hauberks
of
dazzling
brightness
the
numerous
priests
present
have
on
their
finest
robes
even
the
monks
seem
less
somber
in
their
habits
all
is
noise
music
and
animation
the
six
candidates
followed
by
the
whole
rejoicing
company
cross
the
bailey
and
the
lists
and
go
forth
to
the
exercise
ground
by
the
garden
here
there
is
a
platform
covered
with
fine
saracen
carpets
the
duke
of
quelqueparte
stands
thereon
a
majestic
elderly
warrior
in
gilded
armor
the
six
candidates
form
a
semicircle
at
the
foot
of
the
platform
then
aimery
as
the
brother
of
the
giver
of
the
fête
is
the
first
to
mount
immediately
his
first
sponsor
presents
himself
a
knight
a
maternal
uncle
deliberately
he
kisses
the
candidate
then
kneeling
puts
on
his
two
golden
spurs
as
the
uncle
steps
back
conon
and
olivier
present
themselves
they
are
the
second
and
third
sponsors
they
pull
a
dazzling
white
steel
hauberk
over
aimery
head
and
adjust
its
cape
upon
this
last
they
set
the
equally
brilliant
helmet
adorned
with
semiprecious
stones
then
the
fourth
sponsor
the
stately
count
of
perseigne
girds
on
the
candidate
sword
adding
a
few
words
of
admonition
how
the
younger
man
must
use
it
worthily
to
which
the
other
responds
by
lifting
the
weapon
and
piously
kissing
the
relics
set
in
the
hilt
sidenote
the
buffet
of
knighthood
the
four
sponsors
step
back
the
assembled
jongleurs
give
a
mighty
crash
of
music
the
duke
lifts
his
clenched
hand
bow
the
head
he
orders
i
will
give
you
the
blow
aimery
bows
himself
meekly
to
the
greater
lord
but
his
meekness
is
tested
by
the
terrific
stroke
of
his
suzerain
fist
which
sends
him
reeling
but
the
instant
he
recovers
the
duke
seizes
him
in
comradely
embrace
be
brave
sire
aimery
recall
that
you
are
of
a
lineage
famous
both
as
seigneurs
and
as
vassals
and
do
nothing
base
honor
all
knights
give
to
the
poor
love
god
go
the
happy
cavalier
replies
i
thank
you
fair
lord
and
may
god
hear
you
let
me
always
serve
and
love
him
then
he
descends
the
platform
and
each
of
the
other
candidates
mounts
in
turn
to
be
knighted
with
similar
ceremonies
although
the
sponsors
drawn
from
relatives
or
connections
will
be
different
the
crowd
standing
round
follows
the
proceedings
with
the
uttermost
interest
joining
in
a
mighty
shout
each
time
the
blow
of
honor
is
given
then
conon
as
master
of
ceremonies
waves
to
his
marshal
bring
in
the
horses
immediately
the
new
squires
to
the
new
knights
appear
leading
six
steeds
faultlessly
groomed
and
in
beautiful
harness
the
gift
of
the
baron
to
the
candidates
the
instant
the
horses
are
in
front
of
the
platform
the
new
cavaliers
break
from
their
statuesque
rigidity
clothed
as
they
are
now
in
heavy
hauberk
and
helmet
they
run
each
man
to
his
horse
and
try
to
leap
to
the
saddle
at
one
bound
without
touching
foot
to
the
stirrups
an
anxious
moment
for
them
an
equally
anxious
moment
for
parents
brothers
or
sisters
from
the
time
a
young
nobleman
is
in
his
cradle
his
mother
will
discuss
with
his
father
will
he
make
the
when
he
is
knighted
it
is
one
of
the
great
tests
of
a
martial
education
and
one
that
must
be
taken
with
the
uttermost
publicity
truth
to
tell
aimery
and
his
friends
have
been
practicing
the
feat
with
desperate
energy
for
the
last
month
done
all
six
have
mounted
fairly
salvos
of
applause
his
friends
are
congratulating
conon
such
a
brother
the
kinsfolk
of
the
other
young
knights
are
similarly
overwhelmed
sidenote
concluding
exercises
meantime
the
happy
new
cavaliers
hold
their
horses
motionless
for
an
instant
while
their
squires
run
to
them
with
their
lances
and
triangular
shields
the
lances
have
long
bright
pennons
with
three
tails
which
float
down
upon
their
riders
helmets
this
act
performed
the
riders
put
their
steeds
through
all
manner
of
gallops
and
caracoles
and
next
singing
high
with
clear
voice
away
they
go
flying
toward
a
place
on
the
exercise
ground
where
the
the
wooden
manikin
warrior
has
been
set
up
to
smash
its
shield
and
fling
it
to
the
ground
with
a
single
lance
thrust
is
another
unescapable
test
this
ordeal
also
is
met
by
aimery
and
his
peers
with
tolerable
glory
for
all
after
this
sport
the
new
knights
are
expected
to
that
is
to
indulge
in
mock
duels
with
blunted
weapons
these
were
not
counted
serious
contests
but
often
enough
if
blood
is
high
and
rivalry
keen
they
can
take
on
the
form
of
vigorous
combats
however
everybody
is
in
too
good
humor
for
violent
blows
besides
the
real
tournament
begins
and
it
is
best
to
keep
strength
and
weapons
until
then
the
morning
is
now
spent
seigneurial
appetites
have
been
nobly
whetted
the
pavilions
are
again
ready
in
the
garden
and
the
cooks
have
prepared
pasties
joints
of
meat
and
great
quantities
of
roast
poultry
even
as
for
the
wedding
feast
there
is
another
round
of
gorging
and
guzzling
only
this
time
the
six
new
knights
occupy
the
place
of
honor
and
the
master
jongleur
story
is
not
concerning
sad
tristan
but
about
how
brave
godfrey
of
bouillon
stormed
jerusalem
everybody
is
commenting
upon
the
admirable
grace
modesty
and
proficiency
in
arms
of
sire
aimery
a
count
has
approached
conon
already
before
dinner
fair
baron
you
have
a
brother
who
is
a
credit
to
your
name
is
it
true
he
is
to
receive
petitmur
i
have
a
daughter
in
her
fifteenth
year
her
dowry
will
be
but
conon
tactfully
shrugs
his
shoulders
fair
count
my
brother
will
indeed
receive
petitmur
but
he
is
knighted
and
can
speak
for
himself
make
your
marriage
proposals
to
him
i
have
no
longer
the
right
to
control
him
footnotes
lances
grew
longer
and
stouter
in
the
later
middle
ages
in
the
fourteenth
century
they
were
about
fifteen
feet
long
and
were
a
kind
of
battering
rams
designed
to
dash
one
opponent
out
of
the
saddle
even
if
his
armor
were
not
pierced
another
weapon
not
infrequently
used
was
the
mace
an
war
club
with
a
fairly
long
handle
in
powerful
hands
such
a
weapon
could
fell
the
sturdiest
opponent
however
good
his
armor
the
mace
was
somewhat
the
favorite
of
martial
bishops
abbots
and
other
churchmen
who
thus
evaded
the
letter
of
the
canon
forbidding
clerics
to
smite
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
or
to
shed
blood
the
mace
merely
smote
your
foe
senseless
or
dashed
out
his
brains
without
piercing
his
lungs
or
breast
another
weapon
especially
common
in
the
early
middle
ages
was
the
battle
ax
the
destrer
was
so
called
because
it
was
supposed
to
be
led
at
the
knight
right
hand
and
ready
for
instant
use
as
he
traveled
on
his
less
powerful
palfrey
as
chivalry
took
on
its
later
and
more
religious
cast
all
the
acts
of
an
adubbement
became
clothed
with
allegorical
meaning
besides
the
bath
the
candidate
must
lie
down
at
least
for
a
moment
upon
a
bed
because
it
was
an
emblem
of
the
rest
which
god
grants
to
his
followers
the
brave
knights
the
candidate
shirt
is
to
show
that
he
must
keep
his
flesh
from
every
stain
if
he
would
hope
to
reach
heaven
his
scarlet
robe
shows
that
he
must
be
ready
to
pour
out
his
blood
for
holy
church
his
trunk
hose
of
brown
silk
remind
him
by
their
somber
hue
he
must
die
his
white
girdle
warns
him
that
his
soul
should
be
stainless

the
tourney
when
conon
decided
to
give
a
tourney
as
a
climax
to
the
wedding
and
adubbement
festivities
he
sent
out
several
servitors
of
good
appearance
and
loud
voices
to
course
the
country
for
some
twenty
leagues
around

to

to

this
is
crying
the
tourney
as
soon
as
the
news
spreads
abroad
every
petty
sire
takes
council
with
his
wife
whether
he
can
afford
to
go
the
women
begin
to
hunt
up
their
best
bliauts
and
furs
the
men
to
furbish
their
armor
soon
various
cavaliers
arranging
with
their
friends
undertake
to
form
challenge
parties
they
write
on
a
scroll
at
the
castle
of
a
there
are
seven
knights
who
will
be
ready
to
joust
with
all
comers
to
st
aliquis
this
they
post
on
a
tree
by
the
wayside
in
order
that
other
lordlings
may
organize
similar
parties
to
confront
them
tourneys
are
to
be
reckoned
as
little
wars
themselves
and
the
apprenticeship
for
great
ones
they
have
an
inconceivably
prominent
place
in
feudal
life
vainly
the
church
objects
to
them
all
nobles
will
tell
you
that
without
tourneys
you
can
never
train
good
warriors
sidenote
early
tourneys
were
battles
tourneys
however
bring
profit
and
pleasure
to
all
manner
of
people
no
cause
for
unpopularity
the
joy
women
who
rush
to
ply
their
sinful
wiles
despite
every
attempt
to
restrict
them
the
common
villeins
who
drop
their
work
to
enjoy
one
grand
holiday
and
the
merchants
who
really
hold
a
small
fair
near
the
lists
all
are
delighted
as
for
men
of
gentle
blood
an
english
chronicler
can
state
the
case
alike
for
france
and
england
a
knight
can
not
shine
in
war
if
he
has
not
been
prepared
for
it
in
tourneys
he
must
have
seen
his
own
blood
flow
have
had
his
teeth
crackle
under
the
blow
of
his
adversary
have
been
dashed
to
the
earth
with
such
force
as
to
feel
the
weight
of
his
opponent
and
disarmed
twenty
times
he
must
twenty
times
have
retrieved
his
failures
more
than
ever
set
on
combat
he
will
be
ready
for
actual
war
and
can
hope
to
conquer
in
early
feudal
days
tourneys
differed
from
battles
merely
in
that
the
time
and
the
place
were
fixed
in
advance
and
fair
conditions
arranged
according
to
the
epics
at
charlemagne
court
the
nobles
often
got
tired
of
ordinary
sports
and
demanded
a
tourney
the
results
were
merely
pitched
battles
in
which
many
were
slain
and
many
more
wounded
there
was
no
luxury
pomp
or
patronage
by
fair
ladies
at
the
earliest
tourneys
they
were
exceedingly
violent
pastimes
in
which
iron
men
measured
their
strength
and
rejoiced
in
deadly
blows
since
then
tourneys
have
been
getting
less
brutal
an
important
spectacular
element
is
intruding
the
rules
of
combat
are
becoming
more
elaborate
fewer
knights
are
killed
and
there
is
an
appeal
to
something
better
than
mere
fighting
instinct
on
the
other
hand
in
the
thirteenth
century
jousts
and
mêlées
are
far
from
being
mere
displays
of
fine
armor
and
fine
manners
the
military
element
is
still
uppermost
furthermore
since
the
vanquished
cavaliers
are
the
prisoners
of
the
victors
and
are
subject
to
ransom
or
at
least
their
horses
and
armor
are
forfeit
certain
formidable
knights
go
from
tourney
to
tourney
deliberately
seeking
profit
by
taking
prisoners
in
short
so
dangerous
are
tourneys
even
yet
that
as
recently
as
when
prince
louis
heir
of
king
philip
was
knighted
his
father
made
him
swear
he
would
merely
watch
them
as
spectator
for
the
life
of
a
prince
royal
is
too
precious
to
risk
in
such
affairs
the
popes
have
long
since
denounced
tourneys
innocent
ii
eugenius
iii
alexander
iii
and
finally
the
great
and
wise
innocent
iii
have
prohibited
christians
from
participating
in
the
same
under
peril
of
their
souls
but
great
barons
who
shudder
at
the
thought
of
eating
beef
on
fridays
defy
the
church
absolutely
when
it
comes
to
a
matter
of
those
creations
of
the
devil
to
quote
bernard
of
clairvaux
in
which
immortal
souls
are
so
often
sped
when
conon
decides
to
add
a
tourney
as
a
climax
to
his
fête
a
score
of
carpenters
are
hired
down
from
pontdebois
to
help
out
the
levy
of
peasants
in
preparing
the
lists
and
lodges
some
of
the
guests
have
already
come
to
the
wedding
and
the
adubbement
but
many
more
arrive
merely
for
the
knightly
contests
for
these
of
course
the
baron
affords
only
limited
hospitality
a
good
place
to
pitch
their
tents
water
and
forage
with
perhaps
an
invitation
to
the
castle
hall
at
dinner
time
to
certain
leaders
many
visitors
can
get
accommodation
in
the
better
houses
in
the
village
or
at
the
monastery
but
the
weather
being
fine
the
majority
prefer
to
set
out
their
pavilions
by
the
claire
and
the
night
before
the
sports
begin
there
seem
to
be
tents
enough
for
an
army
sidenote
the
lists
and
the
lodges
the
visitors
come
in
their
best
bliauts
and
armor
certain
powerful
counts
collect
as
many
lesser
nobles
as
possible
even
making
up
bands
of
twenty
knights
twenty
squires
a
great
number
of
ladies
and
waiting
women
also
some
hundreds
of
ignoble
servitors
except
for
the
presence
of
the
women
and
the
omission
of
military
precautions
you
might
think
them
going
to
an
ordinary
muster
for
war
meantime
in
the
wide
exercise
ground
where
sire
aimery
had
been
dubbed
the
special
lists
are
made
ready
these
are
simple
affairs
something
like
a
race
course
of
other
days
two
pairs
of
strong
wooden
palisades
are
erected
the
outer
line
is
shoulder
high
the
inner
is
lower
and
has
many
openings
between
the
two
lines
is
the
space
for
spare
horses
squires
attendants
and
heralds
also
for
privileged
spectators
the
humbler
onlookers
will
peer
standing
over
the
outer
palisade
but
behind
and
above
this
rise
the
series
of
lodges
shaded
with
tentlike
canopies
floored
with
carpets
and
gay
with
pennons
in
them
will
be
stationed
the
ladies
and
the
older
less
martial
knights
the
space
within
the
lists
is
some
hundred
yards
long
by
fifty
wide
that
evening
conon
and

eustace
survey
the
decorations
the
forest
of
banners
waving
over
the
colored
pavilions
of
the
visitors
and
listen
complacently
to
the
glad
hum
of
voices
and
the
jongleur
chants
everywhere
arising
ah
fair
baron
says
the
seneschal
all
france
will
talk
of
this
spear
breaking
until
christmas
it
will
be
a
great
day
for

at
gray
dawn

heralds
from
the
castle
go
through
the
avenues
of
tents
calling
monotonously
let
the
jousters
make
ready
let
the
jousters
make
ready
soon
squires
half
dressed
are
seen
running
to
and
fro
there
is
a
great
saddling
and
girdling
neighing
and
stamping
a
few
pious
knights
and
dames
hurry
to
the
castle
chapel
for
a
mass
very
hastily
said
but
the
bulk
of
the
company
cross
themselves
and

by
the
time
the
sun
is
well
above
the
trees
everybody
is
bound
for
the
lists
the
ladies
if
possible
ride
white
mules
and
are
dressed
as
splendidly
as
for
their
own
weddings
not
in
many
a
day
will
aliquis
see
again
such
displays
of
marten
ermine
and
vair
of
sendal
and
samite
of
gold
thread
and
pearls
the
common
folk
point
and
applaud
loudly
when
an
unusually
handsomely
clad
dame
sweeps
by
what
right
have
grand
folk
to
claim
the
obedience
of
the
lesser
if
they
can
not
delight
the
public
gaze
by
their
splendors
as
for
the
jongleurs
their
name
is
legion
the
whole
affair
is
characterized
by
a
music
becoming
deafening
while
the
dames
and
other
noncombatants
take
seats
in
the
lodges
the
six
camp
marshals
distinguished
knights
in
charge
of
the
contests
appear
in
the
lists
they
advance
on
foot
wearing
very
brilliant
bliauts
conon
as
giver
of
the
festivities
is
naturally
at
their
head
behind
follow
the
humbler
born
heralds
and
pursuivants
who
will
assist
them
and
encourage
the
combatants
with
such
cries
as
remember
whose
son
you
are
be
worthy
of
your
ancestry
there
is
also
a
large
squad
of
varlets
and
sergeants
to
keep
order
bring
new
lances
clear
away
broken
weapons
and
rescue
fallen
knights
keen
eye
sweeps
the
tilt
yard
everything
is
ready
the
baron
bows
politely
to
his
suzerain
the
duke
and
duchess
in
the
central
lodge
then
he
raises
a
white
baton
bring
in
the
jousters
he
commands
sidenote
brilliant
procession
of
jousters
instantly
there
is
a
great
blare
of
trumpets
from
the
end
of
the
lists
farthest
from
the
castle
four
gorgeously
arrayed
heralds
lead
the
procession
on
foot
then
comes
a
jongleur
on
horseback
playing
with
his
sword
tossing
it
high
in
the
air
and
catching
as
it
whirls
downward
next
come
the
actual
contestants
some
eighty
knights
riding
two
by
two
they
go
down
one
side
of
the
lists
and
back
the
other
some
cavaliers
turn
deliberately
to
ogle
the
ladies
in
the
lodges
and
the
gentle
dames
old
and
young
are
not
backward
in
leaning
forward
and
waving
in
reply
it
is
a
sight
to
stir
the
blood
all
the
pageantry
of
war
without
as
yet
its
slaughter
the
presence
of
gorgeously
clad
women
in
graceful
attitudes
and
the
air
charged
with
the
excitement
of
brave
deeds
and
of
genuine
perils
to
come
suddenly
all
the
knights
begin
to
sing
the
women
catch
up
the
chorus
of
some
rousing
melody
which
makes
the
lists
shake
the
cavaliers
compel
their
horses
to
prance
and
curvet
as
they
go
by
some
lady
of
especial
favor
from
many
lances
are
hanging
bright
streamers
not
banners
but
sleeves
and
stockings
the
gifts
of
friendly
dames
the
younger
knights
are
rejoiced
by
seeing
damsels
whose
eye
they
have
taken
rise
in
the
lodges
and
then
and
there
before
the
cheering
hundreds
fling
them
gages
of
love
it
is
so
with
young
sire
aimery
as
he
modestly
rides
near
the
tail
of
the
procession
the
daughter
of
the
approving
count
stands
boldly
and
casts
him
a
long
red
ribbon
wherewith
she
had
braided
her
hair
the
other
new
knights
receive
similar
tokens
from
unabashed
admirers
this
process
will
keep
up
through
the
games
the
shrieking
excited
ladies
will
presently
cast
into
the
lists
gloves
girdles
and
ribbons
many
will
sit
at
the
end
with
only
their
flying
hair
and
their
pelissons
and
chemises
for
costume
some
combatants
are
intent
on
grim
business
these
are
the
professional
jousters
determined
to
get
as
many
ransoms
as
possible
and
to
maintain
their
own
proud
reputation
their
armor
is
beautifully
burnished
but
it
is
quite
plain
they
have
prepared
for
a
regular
battle
other
knights
have
painted
their
scabbards
lance
butts
and
shields
with
brilliant
white
red
or
black
on
the
crests
of
their
helmets
they
have
set
outlandish
figures
monsters
heads
of
birds
or
of
women
as
in
fancy
balls
of
other
days
their
aim
is
to
attract
attention
by
the
peculiarity
of
their
costumes
conon
does
not
desire
a
bloody
tourney
and
the
funeral
of
several
friendly
knights
as
a
climax
to
his
gayety
orders
have
therefore
been
given
that
all
lance
points
are
to
be
blunted
also
that
all
sword
edges
and
points
be
rounded
the
tournament
lances
too
are
lighter
than
the
battle
lances
and
made
of
brittle
wood
nevertheless
the
blows
struck
will
be
terrible
the
best
leach
from
pontdebois
is
already
in
the
duke
lodge
and
his
services
will
be
needed
strictly
speaking
a
tourney
falls
into
two
parts
the
jousting
always
comes
first
with
the
mêlée
which
is
the
real
tourney
proper
as
the
grand
climax
to
the
entire
occasion
what
follows
might
seem
to
men
of
other
days
somewhat
monotonous
after
the
novelty
has
worn
away
although
the
first
contests
are
exciting
enough
the
competing
knights
have
been
told
off
in
pairs
partly
by
mutual
consent
partly
by
the
tactful
arrangement
of
the
camp
marshals
after
the
procession
around
the
lists
the
contestants
take
their
stations
some
in
the
saddle
some
dismounted
in
the
spaces
between
the
barriers
there
is
an
awesome
hush
along
the
lodges
and
in
the
great
standing
throng
of
the
vulgar
a
herald
calls
in
loud
voice
let
him
come
to
joust
who
wishes
to
do
battle
instantly
two
keen
trumpets
answer
each
other
from
opposite
ends
of
the
lists
and
two
pursuivants
come
forward
these
worthies
are
really
only
jongleurs
on
less
exciting
days
they
have
now
taken
the
deniers
of
two
young
barons
who
are
anxious
to
make
a
brave
appearance
the
pursuivants
are
grotesquely
dressed
with
bright
mantles
and
bliauts
each
begins
bawling
shrilly
even
while
his
rival
is
calling
here
is
the
good
cavalier
and
baron
ferri
of
potentin
a
brave
knight
of
a
valorous
house
he
will
teach
a
lesson
to
his
enemies
here
is
the
good
cavalier
raoul
eldest
son
of
the
most
puissant
count
of
maurevay
watch
now
his
deeds
all
you
who
love
brave
actions
illustration
a
tournament
in
the
twelfth
century
at
the
back
are
the
galleries
where
the
ladies
sit
then
near
the
entrance
to
the
lists
some
cavaliers
wait
their
turn
to
take
part
in
the
contest
in
the
center
some
servants
and
others
of
the
contestants
pick
up
one
of
the
combatants
who
has
been
thrown
from
his
horse
by
his
adversary
then
each
of
the
twain
reviles
the
master
of
the
other
your
sire
raoul
is
the
son
of
a
crow
all
his
friends
will
this
day
be
ashamed
of
him
let
him
find
his
ransom
money
silence
all
boasts
you
pursuivant
of
a
caitiff
master
sire
ferri
if
he
outlives
the
shock
will
have
his
spurs
struck
from
his
heels
as
being
unworthy
of
knighthood
meantime
the
two
champions
rigid
as
statues
suffer
their
squires
to
lead
them
upon
their
tall
destrers
to
opposite
ends
of
the
lists
when
they
are
facing
and
their
squires
have
nodded
that
their
masters
are
ready
a
marshal
waves
his
white
baton
calling
loudly
in
the
name
of
god
and
michael
do
your
battle
sidenote
lance
breaking
in
the
lists
all
the
dames
nobles
and
rise
in
the
lodges
and
shout
together
when
suddenly
the
two
knights
and
their
mighty
horses
spring
to
life
the
ground
quakes
and
the
sod
flies
when
they
rush
down
the
lists
as
if
hurried
toward
each
other
by
irresistible
force
as
they
gallop
each
bends
low
in
the
saddle
swings
his
shield
to
cover
his
body
lowers
his
helmet
almost
to
the
top
of
his
shield
swerves
his
horse
so
as
to
pass
his
opponent
on
the
right
and
with
sure
grip
drops
his
lance
point
before
him
crash
the
splintering
of
wood
can
be
heard
through
the
din
from
the
lodges
both
horses
are
thrown
upon
their
haunches
and
are
casting
out
great
clods
of
earth
each
knight
is
flourishing
the
broken
butt
of
a
lance
and
across
the
shield
of
each
there
is
a
long
jagged
mark
fairly
broken
fairly
broken
a
noble
course
cries
everyone
the
two
contestants
wheel
gracefully
and
canter
back
to
their
stations
squires
run
up
with
fresh
lances
sire
raoul
takes
a
new
shield
the
earlier
one
showing
signs
of
splitting
as
well
as
being
battered
another
course
another
crash
and
two
more
broken
lances
but
at
the
third
shock
sire
ferri
meets
utter
humiliation
he
indeed
meets
lance
fairly
on
his
shield
and
again
the
tough
wood
is
splintered
but
excitement
overconfidence
or
the
intervention
of
the
devil
makes
his
wrist
a
little
unsteady
at
the
moment
of
collision
raoul
swerves
his
body
a
trifle
to
the
left
ferri
lance
misses
his
foe
shield
entirely
it
flies
off
in
the
air
and
in
the
confusion
escapes
from
his
hand
there
is
hooting
from
the
villeins
worse
still
there
is
shrill
derision
from
all
the
lodges
sire
ferri
rides
back
to
his
post
grinding
his
teeth
and
swearing
blasphemously
he
must
now
pay
a
ransom
to
raoul
for
his
horse
and
armor
despite
the
boastings
of
his
pursuivant
and
not
even
have
the
melancholy
consolation
of
knowing
that
he
was
unhorsed
in
a
fair
collision
sidenote
a
bloody
duel
but
the
next
duel
has
a
more
exciting
ending
two
cavaliers
who
now
engage
are
exceptionally
experienced
knights
at
the
first
charge
both
horses
sustain
such
a
shock
when
the
lances
shiver
that
their
masters
can
barely
force
them
to
their
feet
at
the
second
charge
the
more
skillful
rider
holds
his
lance
so
squarely
that
instead
of
its
breaking
the
opposing
knight
is
fairly
flung
out
of
the
saddle
dashed
from
his
horse
and
sprawled
headlong
with
a
great
clattering
of
armor
the
heralds
and
squires
run
to
him
and
find
that
thanks
to
his
hauberk
he
has
escaped
dangerous
wounds
though
he
coughs
away
several
teeth
great
is
the
excitement
in
the
lodges
several
duels
after
this
end
in
honorable
draws
the
knights
have
agreed
to
break
three
lances
fairly
for
the
love
of
the
ladies
and
gallantly
do
so
there
are
no
victors
or
vanquished
then
it
is
proclaimed
that
two
seigneurs
from
champagne
sire
emeri
and
sire
lourent
having
an
especial
desire
to
debate
together
their
original
quarrel
had
been
over
dice
are
resolved
to
fight
until
one
cries
mercy
and
will
continue
their
battle
on
foot
should
either
be
unhorsed
three
times
they
break
lances
unscathed
but
the
fourth
time
lourent
stirrup
parts
and
he
is
pitched
upon
the
sands
instantly
he
is
free
from
his
snorting
plunging
destrer
and
on
his
feet
flourishing
his
great
sword
emeri
now
might
lawfully
ride
against
him
but
it
is
no
chivalrous
thing
for
a
mounted
knight
to
attack
an
unmounted
one
down
he
leaps
also
making
his
blade
dance
above
his
head
like
a
stream
of
light
then
to
the
infinite
joy
of
the
lodges
the
two
cavaliers
hack
and
feud
with
each
other
for
a
good
ten
minutes
till
the
blood
streams
down
their
faces
the
bright
paint
on
their
shields
is
marred
and
the
crests
of
their
helmets
have
vanished
in
dentings
at
last
emeri
flings
his
strength
into
a
lucky
blow
his
sword
is
blunted
but
by
sheer
weight
of
the
stroke
the
blade
smashes
lourent
shield
asunder
descending
like
a
smith
sledge
upon
his
helmet
lourent
topples
like
a
log
a
great
shout
goes
through
the
lodges
dead
cry
many
but
to
the
relief
of
the
women
the
word
presently
spreads
that
he
is
only
soundly
stunned
though
the
leech
says
that
he
will
not
fight
again
till
christmas
the
duels
continue
all
through
the
morning
there
is
an
interval
while
cakes
and
wine
are
passed
through
the
lodges
and
loaves
are
thrown
among
the
plebeians
most
duels
seem
decidedly
similar
but
each
is
followed
with
undiminishing
delight
the
ladies
no
less
than
their
brothers
and
husbands
grasp
all
the
niceties
of
the
contests
the
methods
whereby
each
champion
holds
his
lance
and
shield
and
controls
his
horse
are
wisely
discussed
by
a
hundred
pairs
of
pretty
lips
between
each
tilt
the
heralds
besides
praising
the
valor
of
the
next
pair
of
combatants
keep
up
their
cries
largesse
gallant
knights
largesse
and
now
one
now
another
baron
rises
in
the
lodges
to
fling
coins
among
villeins
whose
rough
scrambling
causes
much
merriment
or
even
to
toss
money
to
the
heralds
themselves
which
they
never
hesitate
to
pick
up
sidenote
contest
at
the
barriers
many
knights
are
content
with
a
single
passage
at
arms
but
some
who
have
been
successful
once
tempt
fortune
a
second
time
these
are
likely
to
be
the
professional
champions
and
they
give
remarkable
exhibitions
of
perfect
horsemanship
and
lance
play
as
the
afternoon
advances
for
variation
there
is
a
fight
at
the
barriers
a
stout
wooden
bar
about
waist
high
is
set
across
the
middle
of
the
lists
and
seven
knights
from
one
seigneury
and
seven
from
another
undertake
to
cross
the
same
while
preventing
the
other
party
from
advancing
they
fight
on
foot
with
sword
and
mace
it
is
desperate
work
and
when
at
last
one
party
has
forced
its
way
across
four
of
the
defeated
side
have
broken
bones
despite
their
hauberks
and
heads
despite
their
helmets
illustration
knightly
combat
on
foot
from
an
old
print
then
a
very
arrogant
baron
who
has
already
won
three
ransoms
determines
to
increase
his
wealth
stationing
himself
at
the
head
of
the
lists
he
bids
his
pursuivant
challenge
all
comers
there
is
a
long
hush
sire
paul
has
made
such
a
trade
of
his
prowess
that
assuredly
there
seems
something
mercantile
about
his
valor
yet
assuredly
he
is
a
terrible
man
suddenly
the
lodges
begin
to
cry
a
st
aliquis
sire
aimery
himself
who
earlier
had
broken
three
lances
very
neatly
with
a
friend
is
sending
down
his
pursuivant
all
the
older
knights
mutter
a
fearful
risk
for
the
lad
let
him
pray
to
his
saints
conon
demands
angrily
of
olivier
could
not
you
keep
back
the
boy
from
this
folly
but
does
not
heaven
favor
the
young
and
brave
perhaps
it
is
because
sire
paul
has
let
himself
become
careless
perhaps
because
his
squire
has
forgotten
to
tighten
his
saddle
girths
perhaps
because
génevieve
can
not
allow
her
votary
to
undergo
disgrace
thus
early
in
his
knighthood
in
any
case
results
confound
the
wiseacres
the
pitcher
that
goes
too
often
to
the
well
is
broken
dryly
observes
father
grégoire
when
at
the
first
course
sire
paul
is
ignominiously
flung
from
the
saddle
sire
aimery
will
now
have
more
sleeves
girdles
and
stockings
than
can
ever
flutter
from
any
one
lance
and
his
kinsfolk
are
out
of
their
wits
for
joy
no
victory
could
ever
be
more
praised
and
popular
so
ends
the
jousting
and
that
night
round
aliquis
blaze
the
great
camp
fires
of
the
company
all
cooking
most
hearty
suppers
after
fasting
almost
all

visiting
from

the
day

over
again
condoling
with
the
defeated
and
praising
the
victors
alliances
both
military
and
matrimonial
are
negotiated
between
consequential
barons
the
jongleurs
produce
tricks
and
songs
there
is
a
great
deal
of
dancing
by
the
red
firelight
and
also
one
fears
much
hard
drinking
and
most
unseemly
revelry
sidenote
the
great
mêlée
the
next
day
there
is
the
climax
to
the
festival
the
mêlée
really
it
is
nothing
less
than
a
pitched
battle
on
a
small
scale
the
details
have
been
arranged
at
a
council
of
the
more
prominent
seigneurs
at
the
castle
about
forty
knights
on
a
side
are
to
fight
under
the
leadership
of
the
viscount
of
gemours
and
the
baron
of
dompierre
the
space
in
the
lists
is
insufficient
they
go
to
a
broad
convenient
meadow
across
the
claire
where
the
noncombatants
can
watch
from
a
safe
distance
the
marshals
array
the
two
companies
at
least
a
bowshot
apart
groups
of
friendly
knights
are
set
together
and
are
placed
opposite
to
groups
of
rivals
with

than
a
hundred
knights

how
costly

the

is
that

demoralized

it

the
earliest
recorded
tourney
is
alleged
to
have
been
about
in
germany
they
long
continued
to
be
excessively
brutal
as
late
as
one
was
held
near
cologne
at
which
more
than
sixty
persons
perished
often
sharp
weapons
were
used
in
tournaments
especially
between
combatants
who
fought
to
clear
up
some
desperate
personal
grudge
many
noblemen
were
thus
slain
in
a
tourney
in
the
french
fashion
at
london
the
earl
of
essex
was
killed
in
chapter
xiv
a
baronial
feud
the
siege
of
a
castle
we
have
visited
aliquis
in
days
of
peace
and
at
peace
the
seigneury
remains
while
we
tarry
but
peace
and
pageants
no
more
deadly
than
tourneys
are
seldom
the
continuous
state
of
things
rumors
of
wars
there
are
every
day
actual
wars
every
few
years
let
the
saints
be
praised
if
such
contests
are
largely
local
are
not
bitterly
fought
out
and
are
composed
before
they
have
caused
worse
things
than
the
harrying
of
certain
villages
of
helpless
innocent
peasants
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
clergy
and
of
kings
it
will
be
truthfully
written
of
feudal
france
that
war
was
practically
a
permanent
scourge
almost
everywhere
the
society
of
that
day
war
was
the
normal
when
these
wars
are
waged
by
mighty
kings
one
can
at
least
take
the
comfort
that
perhaps
they
are
settling
questions
concerning
many
people
and
however
dreadful
may
pave
the
way
for
lasting
peace
such
a
war
has
lately
found
its
climax
in
the
decisive
battle
of
bouvines
whereof
more
anon
but
most
of
the
wars
are
for
miserably
petty
stakes
time
was
when
every
insignificant
sire
holding
a
feeble
tower
considered
that
he
had
the
right
to
declare
war
on
any
neighbor
with
whom
he
argued
the
rights
to
a
trout
stream
yet
the
case
is
changing
suzerains
are
insisting
that
the
lower
class
of
vassals
arbitrate
their
quarrels
and
not
embroil
the
neighborhood
nevertheless
the
superior
type
of
barons
still
claim
war
as
their
noble
right
the
amount
of
local
fighting
can
hardly
be
computed
sidenote
varieties
of
baronial
wars
there
is
something
abnormal
about
a
powerful
seigneur
who
if
blessed
with
a
long
lifetime
does
not
have
at
least
war
with
each
of
his
several
suzerains
a
war
with
the
bishops
and
abbots
with
whom
he
has
contact
a
war
with
each
neighboring
noble
of
equal
rank
unless
their
houses
are
unwontedly
friendly
and
a
war
with
at
least
some
of
his
own
vassals
a
war
can
start
out
of
a
dispute
about
a
bit
of
land
an
boundary
or
the
exact
obligations
of
a
feudal
tenure
theoretically
the
suzerain
can
interfere
between
wrangling
vassals
practically
he
had
better
let
them
fight
it
out
at
least
till
there
seems
real
danger
that
their
fiefs
will
be
permanently
injured
then
he
can
sometimes
compel
a
truce
unfortunately
however
god
often
permits
the
bitterest
wars
to
be
fought
within
the
fief
itself
sons
fight
with
fathers
the
old
man
will
not
let
his
grown
boys
rule
the
seigneury
to
their
liking
younger
brothers
battle
with
elder
brothers
over
the
inheritance
nephews
attack
uncles
who
seem
prolonging
their
guardianship
sons
even
attack
a
widowed
mother
to
seize
her
dower
lands
these
are
only
some
of
the
things
which
make
the
devil
rub
his
taloned
fingers
nevertheless
certain
limitations
are
intruding
customs
that
have
nearly
the
force
of
law
for
example
if
a
vassal
attacks
his
suzerain
none
but
his
own
family
among
his
noble
followers
can
aid
him
also
in
any
case
at
least
a
week
notice
must
be
given
ere
the
war
is
commenced
after
the
war
does
begin
forty
days
respite
must
also
be
granted
your
foe
relatives
ere
attacking
them
in
the
interval
they
are
entitled
to
proclaim
their
neutrality
and
so
to
become
safe
again
one
is
supposed
to
respect
priests
and
women
and
minors
finally
if
a
truce
is
made
the
suzerain
is
bound
to
punish
the
violators
such
understandings
rob
warfare
of
part
of
its
horrors
but
do
not
prevent
infinite
blood
and
misery
as
for
that
motive
which
prevails
in
other
ages
for
waging
wars
often
it
does
not
seem
to
exist
so
vitally
certainly
frenchmen
ought
to
make
a
common
front
against
germans
italians
english
but
lapses
from
this
obligation
are
not
always
condemned
as
morally
outrageous
quite
recently
the
count
of
boulogne
being
at
odds
with
king
philip
took
money
from
both
the
king
of
england
and
the
emperor
of
germany
to
raise
up
enemies
against
the
king
of
france
and
the
count
evidently
felt
that
this
was
a
proper
measure
against
an
obnoxious
suzerain
the
great
significant
tie
is
that
of
it
is
horrible
to
betray
the
prince
to
whom
you
have
sworn
fealty
a
suzerain
will
call
out
his
host
by
a
summons
to
my
vassals
he
will
seldom
think
of
appealing
to
my
fellow
countrymen
sidenote
few
battles
and
little
strategy
we
have
said
that
wars
are
incessant
yet
there
is
one
strange
thing
about
them
battles
are
very
the
campaigns
abound
in
petty
skirmishes
valorous
duels
surprises
of
small
castles
occasional
clashes
of
cavalry
and
above
all
in
the
pitiless
ravaging
of
the
lands
farms
and
villages
of
the
helpless
peasantry
what
better
way
to
put
pressure
on
your
foe
than
to
reduce
his
villeins
to
such
misery
that
they
can
render
him
nothing
in
money
or
kind
and
that
he
thus
be
brought
to
poverty
if
you
have
the
weaker
force
you
will
not
think
of
meeting
an
invader
in
battle
you
will
shut
yourself
up
in
your
castles
when
you
see
the
burning
villages
stifle
your
pride
remain
passive
and
trust
that
after
the
forty
days
service
of
your
enemy
vassals
is
expired
they
will
weary
of
the
operations
and
not
venture
to
besiege
your
strongholds
then
when
the
foe
army
is
beginning
to
disperse
you
can
employ
some
neutral
baron
or
abbot
to
negotiate
peace
even
when
kings
are
in
the
field
with
really
large
armies
somehow
the
opposing
forces
seldom
risk
a
decisive
encounter
they
maneuver
skirmish
and
negotiate
underhandedly
with
the
uncertain
elements
in
the
hostile
camp
the
upshot
often
is
that
the
invading
army
having
devoured
all
the
provisions
in
the
open
country
and
not
daring
to
besiege
strong
cities
with
a
powerful
enemy
close
at
hand
retreats
homeward
of
course
sometimes
there
are
great
battles
with
great
results
such
in
the
eleventh
century
was
senlac
when
duke
william
the
norman
won
all
england
such
more
recently
was
the
famous
day
at
bouvines
such
marked
several
of
the
crusades
against
the
infidels
particularly
the
great
and
successful
first
crusade
and
the
third
crusade
when
richard
the
lion
hearted
seemed
to
come
nearer
than
any
other
feudal
general
to
being
a
really
able
tactician
if
not
a
great
strategist
these
battles
are
few
and
far
between
and
even
the
mighty
ideal
style
of
fighting
was
rather
that
of
a
headlong
cavalier
followed
by
only
fifteen
knights
and
with
his
ponderous
ax
hewing
a
bloody
lane
through
a
host
of
infidels
than
that
of
a
careful
commander
coolly
directing
a
mighty
army
besides
most
of
the
wars
between
barons
involve
very
small
forces
they
are
only
affairs
for
hundreds
if
matters
come
to
grips
the
best
captain
is
he
who
orders
advance
banner
bearer
follow
me
vassals
and
leads
the
headlong
charge
enormous
pains
have
been
taken
in
training
the
individual
warrior
for
personal
prowess
the
french
cavalier
is
as
formidable
an
individual
as
ever
shared
the
sins
of
mankind
but
he
is
trained
only
in
simple
evolutions
when
maneuvering
in
companies
he
dislikes
taking
orders
he
wearies
of
long
campaigns
his
camps
are
very
unhygienic
and
subject
to
pestilence
wars
in
short
are
to
him
superb
games
exciting
spiced
with
danger
and
played
for
large
stakes
which
give
the
zest
but
save
in
the
crusades
and
certain
other
rare
cases
the
higher
objects
which
supply
wars
with
their
sole
justification
escape
him
entirely
warfare
in
the
true
scientific
sense
of
the
word
is
something
whereof
your
baron
is
usually
in
complete
ignorance
earlier
in
this
recital
it
has
been
seen
that
baron
conon
soon
after
he
obtained
the
seigneury
engaged
in
a
brisk
feud
with
the
viscount
of
foretvert
this
was
so
like
many
other
feuds
in
the
region
that
it
is
well
to
obtain
an
authentic
history
thereof
from
father
grégoire
who
knows
all
the
circumstances
sidenote
beginning
of
a
feud
the
origin
of
the
quarrel
he
tells
us
was
commonplace
doubtless
the
viscount
had
a
contemptuous
opinion
of
his
then
young
and
untried
neighbor
there
was
a
wood
betwixt
the
two
seigneuries
which
had
been
haltingly
claimed
by
foretvert
but
all
through
terrible
baron
garnier
time
none
but
aliquis
peasants
had
been
suffered
to
cut
fagots
there
now
suddenly
huon
one
of
the
forester
helpers
appeared
before
conon
in
a
piteous
plight
his
thumbs
had
been
hewn
clean
off
he
had
been
chopping
timber
on
the
debatable
land
had
been
seized
by
the
viscount
men
haled
before
their
master
and
the
latter
had
ordered
this
treatment
adding
with
a
grin
this
is
the
drink
penny
for
touching
a
twig
in
my
forests
tell
your
young
lord
to
spread
these
tidings
among
his
villeins
when
conon
had
heard
this
taunt
his
squires
trembled
at
the
workings
of
his
face
then
and
there
he
pulled
out
his
sword
placed
his
hands
on
the
hilt
pressing
upon
the
reliquary
and
swore
by
eyes
that
he
would
make
the
viscount
and
all
the
spawn
of
foretvert
swallow
enough
of
their
own
blood
to
be
drunk
to
damnation
certes
says
father
grégoire
he
could
not
as
a
christian
baron
do
less
for
the
lord
who
lets
another
seigneur
oppress
his
villeins
is
no
lord
and
if
he
had
failed
to
resent
such
an
insult
none
of
his
vassals
would
have
obeyed
him
that
same
day
one
of
conon
squires
rode
to
foretvert
he
bore
a
cartel
a
bunch
of
fur
plucked
from
his
master
pelisson
he
was
only
a
young
squire
but
carried
his
head
high
there
was
some
danger
in
being
such
a
messenger
the
squire
had
to
be
as
insolent
as
possible
without
actually
provoking
foretvert
to
violate
the
protection
due
to
a
herald
into
the
great
hall
of
the
offending
seigneur
strode
said
squire
carrying
a
bough
of
pine
in
his
left
hand
the
bunch
of
fur
in
the
right
his
coming
had
been
anticipated
the
greetings
as
he
was
led
up
to
the
dais
where
the
viscount
presided
were
cold
and
ceremonious
then
the
squire
straightened
his
slim
form
and
shook
out
his
long
mantle
sire
viscount
my
master
the
baron
of
aliquis
demands
of
you
satisfaction
if
you
do
not
make
good
the
wrongs
you
have
done
to
him
and
his
i
loyally
defy
you
in
his
name
and
down
he
flung
the
cartel
it
is
fitting
returned
the
viscount
mockingly
a
mere
boy
should
be
a
squire
for
a
lad
tell
your
very
youthful
master
that
i
will
soon
teach
him
a
lesson
in
the
art
of
war
so
with
a
few
more
such
exchanges
the
squire
rode
homeward
meantime
at
aliquis
things
were
stirring
the
great
bell
on
the
donjon
was
ringing
zealous
hands
were
already
affixing
the
raw
hides
to
the
projecting
wooden
hoardings
upon
the
battlements
all
the
storehouses
for
weapons
in
the
bailey
were
being
opened
for
a
distribution
of
arms
from
the
armory
forge
came
a
mighty
clangor
of
tightening
rivets
the
destrers
must
have
caught
the
news
they
stamped
so
furiously
in
the
stables
in
the
great
hall
conon
sat
with
adela
a
wise
head
in
martial
matters
sire
eustace
and
the
other
knights
in
serious
debate
sidenote
mustering
the
vassals
simultaneously
messengers
were
pricking
away
to
all
the
little
villages
and
to
the
fortalices
of
the
vassals
to
the
villeins
they
cried
the
baron
proclaims
war
with
foretvert
bring
your
cattle
and
movables
near
to
the
castle
for
protection
to
the
vassals
they
announced
come
with
all
the
men
you
are
bound
in
duty
to
lead
seven
days
from
to
aliquis
armed
and
provisioned
for
service
and
hereof
fail
not
or
we
burn
you
this
right
to
burn
the
dwellings
of
vassals
who
failed
to
obey
the
summons
to
the
ban
was
one
of
long
standing
in
feudal
lands
other
messengers
proclaimed
the
ban
by
blowing
the
trumpet
at
every
crossroads
in
the
barony
to
have
disobeyed
this
call
would
have
been
the
depth
of
feudal
depravity
none
of
the
vassals
ventured
to
hesitate
on
the
contrary
most
of
them
like
good
liegemen
affected
to
show
joy
at
this
chance
to
follow
their
seigneur
crying
at
once
my
horse
my
horse
and
ordering
out
all
their
retainers
the
abbot
of
the
monastery
now
as
duty
bound
visited
both
leaders
and
vainly
tried
to
negotiate
peace
he
met
with
courteous
thanks
and
prompt
refusals
while
he
was
thus
squaring
with
his
conscience
conon
was
notifying
all
his
outlying
relatives
he
was
also
sending
to
several
powerful
barons
who
had
received
armed
assistance
from
aliquis
in
the
past
and
who
were
now
tactfully
reminded
of
this
fact
he
likewise
sent
an
especially
acceptable
messenger
to
his
suzerain
the
duke
to
convince
the
latter
that
foretvert
was
entirely
wrong
and
that
the
duke
had
better
not
interfere
thanks
to
this
energy
and
diplomacy
by
the
end
of
the
week
the
whole
countryside
had
been
roused
the
peasants
had
driven
most
of
their
cattle
so
close
to
aliquis
castle
that
they
could
be
protected
and
many
villeins
deserting
their
hovels
were
camping
in
the
open
it
being
fine
summer
weather
in
the
space
between
the
barbican
and
bailey
as
for
conon
with
pride
he
mustered
his
array
one
hundred
knights
or
battle
worthy
squires
two
hundred
sergeants
horsemen
of
non
noble
birth
and
some
seven
hundred
footmen
villeins
with
long
knives
pikes
arbalists
big
axes
of
no
great
value
in
open
battle
but
sure
to
have
their
place
in
other
work
ahead
from
foretvert
reports
came
in
of
similar
preparation
but
the
viscount
had
quarreled
with
some
of
his
relations
he
had
broken
a
promise
he
once
made
to
help
a
certain
sire
in
a
feud
his
immediate
vassals
responded
to
his
call
but
they
felt
that
their
lord
ought
to
have
consulted
them
ere
provoking
aliquis
so
grossly
in
a
word
their
zeal
was
not
of
the
greatest
nevertheless
the
viscount
an
impetuous
and
man
having
hastily
assembled
his
forces
the
very
day
the
week
of
intermission
ended
invaded
conon
territory
he
expected
to
find
his
peasants
still
in
the
fields
and
the
aliquis
retainers
in
the
process
of
mustering
to
his
amazement
he
discovered
that
the
villages
were
almost
empty
and
most
of
the
cattle
driven
away
nevertheless
he
foolishly
allowed
his
men
to
scatter
in
order
to
ravage
everything
left
at
their
mercy
soon
hayricks
were
burning
standing
crops
were
being
trampled
down
and
the
thatch
on
the
forsaken
huts
was
blazing
here
and
there
troopers
were
driving
before
their
spears
oafish
peasants
who
had
lingered
too
long
the
hands
of
these
wretches
were
tied
behind
their
backs
beside
them
trudged
their
weeping
wives
and
children
every
sheep
pig
and
chicken
discoverable
was
of
course
seized
the
ravagers
soon
had
enough
booty
to
load
their
horses
to
such
a
degree
that
one
of
foretvert
more
experienced
knights
warned
him
his
men
were
becoming
dangerously
encumbered
in
case
of
an
encounter
sidenote
a
passage
at
arms
the
viscount
laughed
at
these
fears
yet
was
about
to
sound
trumpets
to
recall
the
foraging
parties
when
lo
down
a
wood
road
through
a
forest
that
had
been
imperfectly
scouted
came
charging
the
whole
aliquis
levy
with
conon
great
banner
racing
on
ahead
half
of
the
viscount
men
were
dispersed
the
other
half
barely
got
into
a
kind
of
order
when
their
enemies
were
upon
them
thrusting
slashing
and
laying
about
like
fiends
such
being
the
case
foretvert
had
cause
to
bless
the
virgin
that
he
got
safely
from
the
field
he
only
did
so
because
his
squire
most
gallantly
stabbed
the
horse
of
sire
eustace
just
as
he
was
closing
with
the
viscount
the
squire
himself
was
brained
by
the
seneschal
mace
an
instant
later
five
of
the
foretvert
knights
were
slain
outright
despite
their
armor
four
more
were
pulled
from
their
horses
and
dragged
off
as
prisoners
for
ransom
of
the
foraging
parties
the
leaders
got
home
by
putting
their
horses
at
speed
but
the
miserable
footmen
were
intercepted
by
scores
many
of
these
were
slain
while
dropping
their
sinful
booty
about
forty
were
taken
prisoners
but
being
only
villeins
from
whom
no
ransom
was
to
be
expected
conon
promptly
hanged
ten
as
a
warning
against
further
ravaging
of
his
lands
and
took
the
other
thirty
back
to
his
castle
to
be
hanged
later
in
case
this
first
hint
should
not
prove
effective
this
unusually
decisive
engagement
ought
in
the
opinion
of
many
to
have
ended
the
war
conon
now
invaded
the
foretvert
domains
and
with
proper
precautions
sent
out
ravaging
parties
who
soon
taught
their
foes
a
lesson
as
to
how
to
devastate
a
countryside
but
the
viscount
although
sorely
shaken
and
deserted
now
by
many
arrogantly
refused
to
make
those
concessions
which
conon
declared
his
honor
required
ere
he
could
think
of
peace
the
war
thus
promised
not
to
terminate
until
by
incessant
raids
and
the
peasants
of
both
seigneuries
had
been
brought
to
the
edge
of
starvation
the
viscount
of
course
reckoned
that
at
the
end
of
their
ordinary
forty
days
service
conon
vassals
and
allies
would
leave
him
most
feudal
levies
were
wont
thus
to
melt
away
after
a
very
short
campaign
and
leave
their
leader
bereft
of
almost
all
save
his
immediate
retainers
foretvert
could
then
regather
his
men
and
resume
the
contest
but
the
saints
so
ordered
it
that
conon
had
been
a
thrifty
seigneur
as
well
as
a
popular
suzerain
and
neighbor
he
now
offered
his
allies
and
vassals
good
deniers
if
they
would
serve
until
the
autumn
rains
he
also
hired
the
services
of
some
fifty
horsemen
and
two
hundred
footmen
led
from
lorraine
by
an
soldier
of
fortune
ritter
rainulf
of
the
moselle
who
would
put
his
german
mercenaries
at
the
beck
of
about
any
baron
offering
good
silver
mercenaries
did
not
serve
for
forty
days
but
for
as
many
months
as
they
received
steady
wages
a
great
advantage
conon
likewise
hired
a
fellow
maître
jerôme
the
knights
complained
that
the
baron
gave
him
too
great
pay
and
confidence
but
maître
jerôme
had
been
one
of
the
king
best
engineers
in
the
siege
of
the
great
castle
château
gaillard
on
the
seine
when
philip
augustus
took
that
supposedly
impregnable
fortress
from
john
of
england
in
now
the
castle
of
foretvert
itself
was
almost
as
strong
as
aliquis
and
no
siege
thereof
was
worth
considering
but
the
viscount
had
a
smaller
fortalice
tourfière
which
lay
closer
to
conon
lands
and
was
not
so
formidable
sidenote
siege
of
a
castle
tourfière
consisted
merely
of
a
single
curtain
of
walls
around
the
courtyard
of
a
central
keep
with
of
course
a
palisaded
barbican
before
the
gate
there
was
a
moat
but
not
deep
and
flooded
only
in
wet
weather
and
the
foundations
of
this
stronghold
did
not
rest
apparently
on
solid
rock
a
matter
upon
which
maître
jerôme
laid
great
stress
after
a
discreet
reconnaissance
suddenly
to
the
amazement
of
many
conon
with
all
his
forces
appeared
before
tourfière
and
summoned
its
castellan
sire
gauthier
the
viscount
nephew
to
surrender
a
demand
refused
with
derision
sire
gauthier
commanded
some
twenty
knights
squires
or
sergeants
also
at
least
ninety
armed
villeins
a
sufficient
force
it
seemed
for
a
small
castle
especially
as
the
women
in
the
place
could
drop
stones
throw
down
burning
pitch
hoops
pour
boiling
water
and
help
twist
back
the
casting
engines
the
defenders
thus
prepared
to
resist
with
energy
confident
that
conon
could
not
keep
his
heterogeneous
levies
together
much
longer
and
that
the
siege
would
break
up
ignominiously
but
despite
his
villein
blood
maître
jerôme
ordered
the
siege
in
a
marvelously
skillful
manner
no
chess
player
could
have
moved
his
pieces
better
than
did
he
first
he
persuaded
the
baron
to
resist
his
impulse
to
attempt
the
walls
by
a
sudden
rush
with
scaling
ladders
pointing
out
that
gauthier
besides
his
arbalists
had
four
great
trenchbuts
worked
by
counterweights
and
also
two
catapults
giant
bows
mounted
on
standards
and
able
to
send
a
heavy
arrow
clean
through
a
man
in
full
armor
we
must
take
tourfière
by
the
crowbar
and
spade
and
not
by
the
sword
fair
seigneur
said
jerôme
smilingly
whereupon
a
great
levy
of
conon
serfs
began
cutting
timber
and
building
a
palisade
all
around
the
besieged
castle
to
stop
sorties
or
succoring
parties
meantime
jerôme
was
directing
the
making
of
trenchbuts
and
catapults
for
the
besiegers
with
these
they
soon
smashed
the
wooden
hoardings
which
had
protected
the
battlements
making
it
impossible
for
the
garrison
to
mount
the
walls
save
at
a
few
places
or
in
great
emergencies
lest
they
be
picked
off

attackers

these
terrible
fire
balls
could
not
be
quenched
by
water
but
only
by
sand
by
desperate
efforts
indeed
the
defenders
prevented
decisive
harm
but
some
of
the
buildings
in
the
courtyard
were
burned
and
sire
gauthier

became
wearied
in
their
efforts

fend
off

them

immediately
hanging
four

the
castle

causing
his
largest

to
fling
a

over
the

a
remarkable
energy
of
the
assailants
just
outside

was
observable

then
when
almost

a

to

a
host
of
assailants
swarmed
up
a
ladder
in
the
rear

the
defenders
then
needed
all

idea
that

ere
such
a

could
be
completed
they
said
that
the
baron
was
preparing
battering
rams
and
a
cat
the
battering
ram
was
simply
a
heavy
timber
with
a
metal
head
swung
by
chains
from
a
kind
of
wooden
trestle
set
up
close
under
a
wall
it
was
pulled
back
and
forth
by
ropes
and
by
repeated
blows

cat
was
a

narrow
structure
of
heavy
timbers
covered
with
hides

turn

one
end
of
this
was
built

until
it
came

walls
when
skillful
miners
under
its
protection
quarried
their
way
through
the
masonry
with
pickaxes
illustration

these
methods
were
easier
to
prepare

the
although
not
so
effective
the
defenders
felt
sure
they
would
be
used
when
the
attackers
were
seen
making
large
wooden
shields
mounted
on
small

to
protect

they
crept

one

by

conon
men
stormed
through
the
weak
palisade
of
the
barbican
and
forcing
their
way
near
to
the
walls
began
filling
up
the
moat
with
bundles
of
fagots
by
using
his
trenchbuts
and
catapults
to
best
advantage
sire
gauthier
felt
confident
however
that
he
had
prevented
them
from
leveling
the
moat
sufficiently
to
make
a
firm
foundation
for
siege

the
tourfière

therefore
shouted
arrogantly
take
your

your

gnaw

presently
after
a
couple
of
weeks
the
besiegers
were
seen
in
great
activity
as
if
arraying
themselves
for
an
assault
gauthier
was
convinced
they
were
about
in
desperation
to
try
to
scale
his
walls
with
ladders
then
of
a
sudden
a
sergeant
ran
up
to
his
watchtower
wafts
of
smoke
were
escaping

gauthier
instantly
realized
what
had
happened
but
it
was
too
late
under
an
elaborate
feint
with
other
preparations
maître
jerôme
had
taken
advantage
of
the
soft
ground
beneath
the
castle
and
had
driven
a
mine
beginning
at
a
safe
distance
in
the
rear
and
cunningly
concealing
the
entrance
and
the
earth
excavated
until
it
was
fairly
under
a
vital
section
of
the
wall
then
a
large
chamber
had
been
cleared
and
wooden
posts
soaked
with
tallow
had
been
put
under
the
masonry
to
keep
it
from
falling
on
the
miners

the
last
of
them
retreated

was
set
to
the

having
been
crammed

saw

the
defenders
met
them
bravely
in

there
was

but
the
thrust
of
numbers
was
irresistible
gauthier
and
part
of
his
men
fled
indeed
to
the
donjon
and
barred
the
entrance
but
they
were
utterly
demoralized
all
the
women
and
children
packed
into
the
tower
were
shrilly
lamenting
the
dead
and
were
otherwise
frantic

have

however
was
able
to
exact
very

obtained

oath
of
henry
ii
of
england
and
other
great
chieftains
later
custom
would
probably
have
sent
a
glove
such
plunderings
were
common
enough
though
the
best
knightly
sentiment
was
against
participating
directly
in
them
says
a
bard
geraud
de
borneil
o
fie
on
the
knight
who
drives
off
a
flock
of
bleating
sheep
and
then
appears
before
a
lady
these
prisoners
were
lucky
if
they
finally
escaped
without
at
least
mutilation
to
give
your
captives
of
villein
blood
the
empty
sleeve
or
the
wooden
leg
seems
to
have
been
direfully
common
in
feudal
wars
similar
taunts
were
delivered
at
the
siege
of
carcasonne
in
chapter
xv
a
great
feudal
battle
bouvines
so
ended
the
feud
between
aliquis
and
foretvert
a
less
exhausting
and
more
decisive
baronial
war
than
were
many
and
causing
correspondingly
less
misery
to
the
helpless
peasants
but
it
has
also
been
conon
fortune
to
fight
in
a
really
great
battle
one
that
will
hereafter
be
set
down
among
the
most
famous
engagements
in
the
annals
of
france
it
is
a
sunny
afternoon
young
françois
and
anseau
have
wearied
of
hunting
frogs
beside
the
outer
moat
under
the
garden
trees
sire
eustace
tough
old
warrior
is
meditating
over
a
pot
of
hippocras
they
demand
of
him
once
more
the
story
of
the
battle
for
them
there
is
only
one
battle
bouvines
the
seneschal
ever
the
slave
of
his
youthful
masters
after
suitable
urgings
begins
now
you
must
know
my
fair
damoisieux
that
all
this
took
place
six
years
since
in
the
year
upon
the
day
of
july
for
our
sins
it
was
extremely
hot
that
season
so
that
all
of
us
have
i
trust
obtained
some
remission
from
purgatory
god
grant
that
next
time
we
have
a
great
battle
it
be
in
the
pleasant
spring
or
autumn
though
otherwise
the
saints
showed
to
us
french
a
great
mercy
but
now
to
commence
that
year
king
john
of
england
having
by
his
evil
rule
and
folly
lost
nearly
all
his
anjou
and
norman
lands
to
our
good
king
philip
sent
large
money
and
skillful
ambassadors
into
flanders
and
germany
to
stir
up
trouble
the
great
counts
of
flanders
and
boulogne
nursed
grievances
against
their
liege
lord
our
king
and
to
them
joined
many
other
seigneurs
of
those
parts
notably
the
dukes
of
brabant
and
limburg
the
count
of
holland
and
chiefest
of
all
the
german
emperor
otto
iv
himself
who
came
with
a
huge
levy
of
saxons
with
those
rode
the
english
earl
of
salisbury
with
a
great
band
of
flemish
mercenaries
who
took
king
john
penny
never
since
duke
charles
martel
smote
back
the
paynym
had
so
terrible
a
host
menaced
our
gentle
france
and
when
at
last
in
july
the
whole
array
under
emperor
otto
came
together
at
valenciennes
to
take
the
road
to
paris
even
brave
knights
trembled
for
the
king
and
kingdom
never
had
the
call
for
the
royal
ban
and
rear
ban
gone
out
more
urgently
than
that
summer
the
king
messenger
came
to
aliquis
with
the
of
summons
bidding
messire
conon
ride
with
every
man
and
lad
that
could
stride
a
horse
or
trudge
with
a
spear
and
so
went
the
command
through
all
north
france
but
in
the
south
country
john
was
making
a
formidable
diversion
from
his
remaining
dominions
in
gascony
and
we
of
the
languedoil
lands
had
to
meet
the
northern
shock
alone
when
messire
your
father
received
the
summons
there
was
even
greater
furbishing
than
when
old
foretvert
defied
us
sire
conon
had
in
the
abbot
and
wrote
his
last
wishes
arranged
that
if
he
fell
he
should
be
buried
in
the
abbey
church
by
the
altar
where
bernard
had
once
said
mass
and
he
left
to
the
monks
five
hundred
livres
in
return
for
perpetual
masses
for
his
soul
the
remainder
of
us
made
vows
according
to
ability
i
say
nothing
of
the
parting
or
how
your
mother
bravely
promised
to
guard
the
castle
sidenote
mobilization
of
feudal
army
so
the
ban
was
answered
all
through
the
land
and
the
king
great
host
came
together
never
again
shall
i
see
so
fine
a
mustering
of
knights
as
gathered
at
peronne
it
far
surpassed
any
tournament
every
hour
the
banners
came
in
to
the
sound
of
tabors
horns
and
drums
there
was
an
enormous
baggage
train
so
that
i
believe
there
were
more
mules
than
horses
for
many
barons
brought
their
great
tents
with
many
coffers
of
extra
arms
and
fine
clothing
in
the
rear
were
gathered
a
second
array
of
jongleurs
peddlers
and
very
evil
women
whom
not
all
the
commands
of
the
king
somehow
could
disperse
verily
in
that
army
there
were
twice
as
many
mouths
to
fill
as
there
were
men
to
fight
likewise
short
as
was
the
campaign
there
was
much
sickness
thanks
to
bad
food
bad
water
and
so
certain
even
averred
to
overmuch
filth
the
comfort
was
that
in
otto
camp
matters
were
if
anything
much
worse
in
any
case
those
tumultuous
days
of
assemblage
were
soon
at
an
end
tidings
came
that
the
germans
and
flemings
were
advancing
and
on
the
of
july
we
marched
into
tournai
on
the
edge
of
flanders
messire
conon
who
was
at
the
royal
told
me
that
the
king
barons
debated
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
enemy
would
he
offer
fair
battle
in
the
plain
near
cambrai
as
we
much
desired
or
would
he
strive
to
slip
past
our
army
and
go
straight
toward
paris
i
have
been
told
of
books
concerning
the
ancient
roman
captains
julius
cæsar
and
his
peers
and
it
would
seem
as
if
to
them
the
moving
of
armies
had
been
a
business
of
deep
sagacity
advancing
your
columns
by
careful
rules
somewhat
as
you
move
your
men
on
a
gaming
board
no
one
however
is
so
sage
as
that
and
i
think
it
was
either
mere
fortune
or
speaking
as
a
christian
the
kind
denis
who
guards
our
beautiful
france
that
brought
the
hosts
together
when
and
where
they
presently
came
it
was
at
break
of
day
on
that
of
july
that
we
quitted
tournai
intending
to
pass
the
little
river
marque
to
get
to
the
town
of
bouvines
and
thereby
to
be
covered
by
certain
marshes
so
we
might
be
protected
from
surprise
and
yet
be
able
to
strike
the
foe
rear
if
he
should
take
the
road
to
paris
but
otto
and
his
lords
swollen
with
their
german
and
fleming
pride
and
confident
in
their
great
host
of
infantry
were
determined
to
attack
and
so
kept
hard
after
us
it
is
only
nine
miles
from
tournai
to
bouvines
but
our
long
trains
of
baggage
crawled
along
like
snails
therefore
it
was
almost
noon
when
the
sumpter
mules
and
the
infantry
had
crossed
the
bridge
we
of
the
cavalry
were
still
on
the
nearer
side
covering
the
march
when
our
scouts
came
racing
in
germans
the
germans
and
there
assuredly
over
the
rolling
slopes
of
the
cornfields
beyond
bouvines
we
saw
the
long
lines
of
horsemen
flying
in
a
great
dust
cloud
now
there
was
with
the
king
the
bishop
garin
of
senlis
he
was
an
old
knight
hospitaler
one
of
those
holy
brethren
who
despite
churchly
vows
rejoice
to
fight
in
just
causes
and
bishop
garin
at
once
clapped
spurs
to
his
destrer
to
reconnoiter
soon
he
dashed
back
having
discovered
quite
enough
he
found
our
lord
philip
sitting
under
an
ash
tree
close
to
the
bridge
eating
dinner
with
many
great
nobles
messire
conon
among
them
sitting
on
the
grass
fair
sire
cried
garin
germans
will
fight
their
knights
are
in
panoply
and
behind
them
march
the
infantry
sidenote
battle
array
at
bouvines
it
was
no
pleasant
moment
for
the
king
his
own
infantry
were
beyond
the
river
but
his
cavalry
were
on
this
side
he
could
not
get
his
horsemen
across
the
single
bridge
without
grievous
loss
but
there
was
perchance
still
time
to
bring
back
the
foot
therefore
with
what
speed
we
might
every
man
of
us
fell
into
the
array
and
some
brave
sergeants
of
champagne
made
such
charges
upon
otto
vanguard
that
though
outnumbered
and
pressed
back
they
delayed
the
foe
until
our
men
could
take
their
places
and
present
a
gallant
front
as
for
the
attackers
when
they
saw
that
we
were
ready
to
do
battle
like
prudent
men
they
halted
and
arrayed
their
own
lines
so
for
an
hour
both
sides
waited
just
out
of
bowshot
many
of
us
very
nervous
and
cursing
the
delay
the
more
as
the
sun
beat
down
pitilessly
although
the
more
pious
confessed
hastily
to
the
priests
who
were
always
moving
up
and
down
the
files
or
at
least
we
said
our
for
our
sins
presently
you
could
see
the
whole
array
of
the
enemy
spread
out
like
some
fair
picture
on
a
long
tapestry
on
their
right
facing
our
counts
of
ponthieu
and
dreux
were
the
mercenaries
under
salisbury
and
the
men
of
that
foul
traitor
boulogne
on
their
left
were
the
long
lines
of
flemish
horsemen
over
against
our
cavaliers
of
champagne
and
burgundy
but
we
from
quelqueparte
with
so
many
other
companies
were
in
the
center
battle
where
flew
king
philip
great
oriflamme
a
mighty
scarlet
banner
of
samite
surrounded
by
chosen
cavaliers
we
horsemen
were
in
the
rear
in
front
of
us
spread
the
french
footmen
the
burgher
levies
of
the
towns
who
answered
the
king
summons
that
burghers
should
stand
before
knights
cried
some
of
us
but
the
king
and
bishop
garin
who
seemed
to
know
everything
understood
their
business
as
you
will
see
it
is
told
that
just
before
the
hosts
charged
king
philip
prayed
aloud
before
his
bodyguard
i
am
but
a
man
but
i
am
also
a
king
thine
it
is
to
guard
the
king
thou
wilt
lose
nothing
thereby
wherever
thou
wouldst
go
i
will
follow
thee
also
i
heard
that
close
behind
the
king
there
stood
as
long
as
he
might
the
royal
chaplain
william
the
breton
who
all
through
the
battle
with
another
clerk
kept
singing
psalms
such
as
be
the
lord
my
strength
who
teacheth
my
hands
to
war
and
my
fingers
to
fight
but
bishop
garin
sang
no
psalms
up
and
down
the
lines
of
horsemen
he
rode
thundering
yourselves
lest
the
enemy
outflank
you
one
knight
should
not
make
another
his
shield
so
he
put
all
our
knights
in
the
first
line
of
the
cavalry
in
the
rear
lines
he
put
the
mounted
sergeants
we
had
perhaps
two
thousand
knights
and
five
thousand
sergeants
our
infantry
were
over
thousand
but
the
foe
had
even
more
footmen
than
we
though
their
horse
was
a
little
inferior
thus
the
battle
was
very
fair
two
lines
of
men
and
horses
a
mile
and
a
half
long
and
the
fields
smooth
and
open
enough
for
a
jousting
there
never
was
better
place
for
an
honorable
battle
after
we
had
sat
in
our
saddles
a
long
time
thinking
of
our
sins
and
admiring
in
a
fearsome
way
the
splendor
of
the
great
press
of
the
foe
opposite
a
party
of
our
sergeants
suddenly
charged
out
on
our
right
against
the
flemings
their
attack
was
too
weak
and
the
flemings
drove
them
back
and
charged
in
return
their
leaders
crying
on
your
ladies
as
if
in
a
courteous
mêlée
whereat
nothing
loath
our
burgundian
and
champagnois
knights
dashed
out
on
them
and
long
engaged
in
an
uncertain
battle
every
cavalier
selecting
a
foe
and
riding
against
him
here
one
side
prevailed
and
here
another
and
some
warriors
even
dropped
to
the
rear
to
recover
breath
and
tighten
harness
then
spurred
back
to
the
charge
for
a
little
while
we
of
the
center
watched
them
thus
then
nearer
things
engrossed
us
sidenote
defeat
of
the
french
infantry
i
have
told
you
that
king
philip
and
his
footmen
as
well
as
many
of
our
knights
held
the
center
battle
facing
them
was
the
dense
array
of
flemish
and
german
infantry
with
emperor
otto
himself
accompanied
by
chosen
horsemen
in
their
rear
and
we
could
see
in
the
middle
press
the
great
imperial
banner
a
silken
dragon
white
and
green
raised
upon
a
pole
capped
with
a
golden
eagle
it
was
not
borne
by
a
cavalier
but
flew
from
a
tall
car
drawn
by
four
horses
as
we
gazed
at
this
vast
hostile
array
lo
the
whole
mass
seemed
surging
forward
against
our
infantry
never
was
there
a
sight
like
it
spear
points
hauberks
and
helmets
all
flashing
in
the
sun
the
ground
shook
with
the
trample
of
thousands
of
feet
countless
war
horns
sounded
and
we
heard
the
deep
hoch
of
the
german
infantry
coming
down
on
us
like
thunder
then
the
emperor
great
masses
struck
our
footmen
from
the
communes
doubtless
our
poor
knaves
meant
bravely
and
always
had
plenty
of
courage
when
defending
their
walls
but
never
would
france
and
king
philip
have
been
saved
by
townsmen
soon
we
saw
all
those
infantry
breaking
toward
the
rear
and
for
a
moment
our
skies
looked
black
but
the
ranks
called
messire
conon
and
our
other
leaders
let
the
villeins
run
through
so
we
opened
the
lines
in
the
cavalry
and
let
these
timid
friends
escape
then
came
a
last
tightening
of
buckles
and
pushing
down
of
helms
right
before
us
thousands
upon
thousands
were
surging
the
emperor
infantry
all
together
we
raised
the
glad
denis
the
royal
battle
cry
of
france
whereupon
followed
such
a
coursing
as
never
in
all
my
life
i
can
hope
again
to
see
with
our
eyes
on
otto
great
banner
straight
into
that
press
of
germans
and
flemings
we
french
cavaliers
rode
like
mad
the
knights
in
front
and
all
the
squires
and
good
sergeants
raging
behind
us
the
horses
knew
their
hour
they
flew
at
speed
with
no
touch
of
spur
though
i
am
blessed
with
all
the
joys
of
paradise
never
after
ten
thousand
years
of
bliss
shall
i
forget
the
wondrous
rapture
i
felt
when
we
struck
that
hostile
line
sire
eustace
eyes
are
gleaming
now
like
sparks
of
fire
françois
and
anseau
are
hardly
breathing
as
he
speaks
sidenote
charge
of
the
french
knights
through
that
caitiff
infantry
we
went
as
a
hot
knife
cleaves
through
cheese
i
had
the
aliquis
banner
and
kept
close
behind
messire
conon
with
all
our
men
hallooing
and
smiting
behind
what
chance
had
those
villein
footmen
against
frenchmen
who
all
had
known
horses
and
lance
since
they
ceased
from
mother
milk
so
one
and
all
we
charged
and
like
castles
rising
out
of
the
plain
soon
you
could
see
here
there
and
yonder
the
banners
and
squadrons
of
our
cavaliers
on
their
tall
horses
looming
above
the
snarling
striking
footmen
who
closed
in
all
around
them
and
yet
could
not
keep
our
knights
from
charging
forward
always
forward
after
that
all
the
battle
was
broken
up
for
when
emperor
otto
and
his
knights
saw
their
infantry
being
cut
down
like
sheep
they
also
charged
giving
us
the
honest
joy
of
crossing
swords
with
men
of
nobility
so
for
a
long
time
it
was
horse
to
horse
and
man
to
man
you
have
heard
the
jongleurs
tell
of
the
great
deeds
done
but
as
for
us
of
aliquis
just
as
we
were
close
to
hewing
our
way
clear
through
the
whole
german
line
lo
a
great
shouting
rose
on
our
left
the
king
the
king
and
we
saw
the
royal
standard
being
tossed
up
and
down
as
in
distress
by
sire
wado
de
montigny
who
bore
it
then
back
we
charged
with
many
cavaliers
more
just
in
time
for
king
philip
while
attacking
gallantly
like
any
other
knight
had
been
separated
from
most
of
his
friends
and
a
swarm
of
knavish
flemish
pikemen
had
striven
to
drag
him
from
his
horse
his
good
armor
turned
their
pikes
yet
a
soldier
caught
the
hook
of
a
halberd
in
the
chain
mail
round
his
throat
and
pulled
him
to
the
ground
but
the
king
sprang
up
as
briskly
as
a
young
squire
and
all
the
french
knights
at
hand
spurred
to
his
aid
then
it
was
that
sire
peter
tristen
leaped
from
his
own
horse
and
mounted
his
lord
upon
it
and
messire
conon
being
among
the
very
first
to
ride
up
and
scatter
or
trample
the
flemings
later
received
no
small
praise
and
thanks
therefore
in
that
part
of
the
field
god
prospered
us
and
then
came
the
signal
mercy
when
emperor
otto
fled
the
field
for
as
our
knights
charged
and
his
cavaliers
gave
way
our
men
slew
otto
horse
and
when
he
fell
they
almost
seized
the
emperor
however
his
saxons
selling
their
lives
right
dearly
got
him
another
horse
but
herein
was
the
german
emperor
different
from
our
good
french
king
for
when
philip
was
remounted
again
he
raised
once
more
his
clear
denis
and
pressed
the
charge
but
otto
nigh
out
of
his
wits
perhaps
and
somewhat
wounded
fled
from
the
field
with
only
three
knights
leaving
his
great
banner
and
all
his
brave
vassals
to
their
fate
and
they
say
he
never
drew
rein
till
he
reached
valenciennes
sidenote
rout
of
the
germans
and
flemings
the
german
knights
though
deserted
still
fought
bravely
but
the
netherlanders
and
flemings
soon
were
fleeing
in
droves
besides
on
the
two
wings
of
the
conflict
we
frenchmen
were
already
proving
victorious
and
from
right
and
left
our
knights
were
charging
in
to
help
the
center
cutting
their
way
so
far
to
the
rear
that
when
at
last
the
german
cavaliers
knew
that
all
was
lost
and
now
began
to
flee
they
often
found
themselves
surrounded
and
were
pulled
from
their
horses
and
so
made
captive
thus
ended
the
day
work
save
on
the
right
wing
of
the
enemy
here
had
fought
the
great
rebel
reginald
of
boulogne
who
knew
there
was
naught
left
for
him
save
victory
or
ruin
he
formed
some
seven
hundred
brabantine
infantry
into
a
circle
with
their
pikes
and
axes
they
beat
off
for
long
the
charges
of
our
cavaliers
from
behind
this
living
wall
boulogne
with
a
few
brave
knights
time
and
again
charged
out
performing
high
deeds
of
valor
and
then
as
it
were
retreating
into
their
fortress
to
get
breath
but
now
that
the
remainder
of
the
field
was
cleared
king
philip
brought
up
his
whole
power
of
cavalry
he
formed
three
thousand
of
us
into
three
great
columns
of
mounted
men
and
charging
in
on
every
side
by
sheer
weight
we
broke
the
brabantine
circle
down
so
we
dragged
the
count
of
boulogne
from
his
horse
fighting
to
the
last
and
the
king
holds
him
close
prisoner
unto
this
day
this
was
the
last
mêlée
of
a
battle
the
like
whereof
has
not
been
in
france
these
many
years
of
course
the
slaughter
of
the
footmen
was
great
some
thousands
of
both
ours
and
theirs
the
field
was
a
sorry
sight
that
evening
and
the
groans
of
the
dying
rang
in
my
ears
for
all
that
we
were
so
happy
but
it
pleased
the
saints
that
thanks
to
good
armor
we
cavaliers
got
off
quite
safely
i
have
heard
that
three
french
knights
were
slain
although
i
am
sure
that
number
is
too
few
of
the
germans
and
flemings
they
say
one
hundred
and
seventy
knights
were
killed
outright
but
better
still
we
took
five
german
counts
barons
and
some
hundred
and
six
lesser
knights
as
prisoners
it
was
the
ransom
of
that
baron
of
imgerfels
whom
we
unhorsed
which
presently
went
far
to
pay
for
your
aunt
wedding
and
uncle
knighting
as
for
the
manner
in
which
we
all
returned
to
paris
joyous
as
the
angels
and
how
the
church
bells
rang
and
all
the
fat
burghers
hung
the
streets
with
tapestry
and
with
the
clergy
and
scholars
in
the
university
we
had
seven
days
of
illuminations
feastings
and
rejoicings
which
is
a
story
repeated
every
day
but
there
will
never
be
another
bouvines
so
spoke
the
seneschal
if
we
would
comment
on
his
narrative
we
would
say
that
philip
manifestly
conquered
because
his
very
unepiscopal
chief
of
staff
bishop
garin
drew
up
his
army
with
greater
skill
than
otto
leaders
arranged
the
host
and
also
because
when
at
last
the
hosts
engaged
in
a
series
of
innumerable
duels
the
french
knights
on
the
average
proved
superior
king
philip
after
the
fight
was
started
showed
himself
a
valiant
cavalier
personally
but
hardly
figured
as
a
commander
otto
contributed
to
shake
the
morale
of
his
men
by
premature
flight
but
his
great
host
of
footmen
were
almost
worthless
despite
their
pikes
and
halberds
against
the
terrific
shock
of
the
french
cavalry
charging
on
perfectly
smooth
ground
where
mailed
horsemen
could
fight
at
their
best
missile
weapons
played
no
part
when
the
english
yew
bow
shall
appear
the
situation
may
change
till
then
the
mounted
knight
in
all
his
ponderous
armor
charging
with
lance
at
rest
or
with
his
great
sword
dancing
in
his
hands
will
appear
as

the

seem

command

they

no

no

a

monotonous

seldom
detains
the

it
is

to

so
often
seen
spreading
beyond

to
the
west
of

the
aliquis
peasants
are
told
that
they
have
naught
whereof
to
complain
they
have
a
kindly
seigneur
who
renders
justice
since
the

about

had
divided
mankind
into

great

the

adding
that
to
furnish

with

is
the
obligation
of
the
servile
class
since
these
classes
are
clearly
ordained
of
heaven
to
rebel
against
one
status
is
manifestly
questioning
the
justice
of
providence
a
damnable
impiety
few
of
the
aliquis
peasants
ever
dream
of
being
anything
but
villeins
they
regard
gentlefolk
somewhat
as
good
christians
regard
angels
as
beings
of
another
sphere
all
they
hope
for
is
kindly
treatment
and
modest
prosperity
within
the
limits
providentially
assigned
them
therefore
they
are
not
too
unhappy
if
we
go
up
and
down
france
we
shall
find
the
rural
population
decidedly
dense
one
little
village
usually
follows
another
closely
and
every
collection

with
human
bipeds
there
are
indeed

which
might
with

management
be
put

the
extent

is
great

surely

it
has
been

not
for
many

have
matters
in
the

been
as

you
can
go
on
multiplying
stories
about

how
human
flesh
at
times
was
sold
in
markets
how
starving
children
were
lured
by
the
offers
of

the
serfs
of
the
barony
had
been
manumitted
about
a
hundred
years
earlier
by
a
baron
who
after
an
extremely
iniquitous
life
was
admonished
on
his
deathbed
by
his
confessor
that
he
must
do
something
extraordinary
for
the
salvation
of
his
soul
as
a
result
the
aliquis
peasants
were
no
longer
bound
to
the
soil
and
could
quit
the
seigneury
as
serfs
assuredly
could
not
do
they
could
also
marry
any
women
they
wished
without
asking
their
lord
consent
or
paying
him
a
fee
they
could
bequeath
their
goods
without
having
him
sequester
an
outrageous
part
all
this
of
course
improved
their
status
yet
they
were
still
subject
to
numerous
imposts
in
money
and
kind
and
to
various
forms
of
forced
labor
although
they
had
now
the
legal
right
to
quit
the
barony
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
could
they
sell
their
little
farms
and
chattels
thereon
so
they
could
take
a
decent
share
of
their
possessions
elsewhere
and
if
they
wandered
to
distant
parts
the
local
authorities
were
likely
to
call
them
masterless
men
and
assume
that
if
they
had
forsaken
their
old
lord
they
must
somehow
be
criminals
sidenote

it
is
much
better
to
be

lower
classes
are
now
becoming
free
although
in
other
christian
lands
notably
germany
serfage
will
prevail
for
a

hereafter
but
even
though
one
becomes

he
is
a

that

if

thereof
toward

who
would
accuse

then
take

for
condoning
their
alleged

and
he

was
deceived
by

even
a

has
his

scattered
in
several
tiny
holdings
possibly
at
the
four
quarters
of
the
neighborhood
when
a

divide

who
will
not
even
tell
a
traveler
the
way
there
is
the
malcontent
villein
who
mutters
enviously
whenever
he
sees
a
knight
riding
out
hawking
there
is
the
mad
fool
who
reviles
god
saints
church
and
nobility
there
is
the
talkative
villein
who
is
always
arguing
bad
causes
before
the
court
and
inciting
his
neighbors
to
senseless
litigation
there
is
the
honest
simpleton
who
wandered
up
to
pontdebois
and
got
his
pockets
picked
while
gaping
at
the
sculptures
on
the
portal
of
the
cathedral
finally
there
are
the
misers
the
petty
speculators
in
grain
who
pray
for
a
famine
and
all
the
tribe
of
poachers
certainly
there
are
also
a
great
number
of
honest
folk
who
bow
respectfully
when
messire
conon
rides
by
and
who
pay
their
taxes
without
grumbling
such
give
prosperity
to
the
seigneury
but
it
is
the
rascals
who
ever
thrust
themselves
into
prominence
the
aliquis
villeins
seem
doltish
and
dirty
enough
but
they
are
nothing
to
those
existing
in
flanders
some
monks
have
recently
returned
thence
after
doing
business
for
their
order
they
tell
with
horror
that
in
summertime
flemish
peasants
are
seen
around
their
villages
taking
their
ease
with
no
more
clothes
on
than
when
they
were
born
when
the
monks
remonstrated
the
rough
answer
was
how
is
this
your
business
you
make
no
laws
for
us
it
is
pitiful
say
the
monks
that
any
seigneur
should
tolerate
such
things
on
his
fief
for
the
peasants
are
such
sodden
creatures
they
can
not
of
themselves
be
expected
to
know
better
if
the
knights
exploit
the
peasants
the
clergy
do
so
hardly
less
it
is
notoriously
hard
for
the
bishop
tithe
collector
to
secure
the
quota
of
pigs
hens
eggs
wheat
vegetables
which
everybody
knows
that
the
villein
owes
to
the
church
after
or
upon
the
same
time
he
satisfies
the
collectors
for
the
baron
indeed
certain
impious
villeins
complain
the
tithe
is
worse
than
the
imposts
and
the
the
monkish
preachers
have
to
be
constantly
threatening
these
sinners
who
pay
their
tithes
slowly
the
church
tithe
is
the
property
of
god
it
is
the
tax
you
owe
to
god
a
sign
of
his
universal
dominion
those
who
withhold
it
not
merely
imperil
their
souls
but
god
will
send
them
drought
and
famine
punishing
them
alike
in
this
world
and
the
next
villeins
too
often
wickedly
insist
on
working
on
sundays
and
holy
days
the
peasants
complain
there
are
so
many
saints
days
that
it
is
hard
to
keep
track
of
them
but
if
only
they
would
go
to
church
on
sundays
when
the
priest
announces
the
next
holy
days
they
could
avoid
this
sin
worse
still
are
the
peasants
who
when
they
see
their
fellows
going
dutifully
to
mass
hide
under
the
hedges
then
slip
away
to
rob
the
unguarded
orchards
sidenote
gross
oppression
by
knights
it
seems
certain
therefore
that
god
has
no
such
love
for
villeins
as
he
has
for
gentle
knights
and
their
dames
the
knights
display
their
superiority
by
always
reminding
their
peasants
of
their
condition
with
some
barons
to
flog
their
villein
for
most
trifling
offenses
is
about
as
common
as
for
them
to
eat
their
dinners
even
conon
has
plenty
of
use
for
his
riding
whip
unless
the
blows
are
very
brutal
the
average
peasant
takes
this
as
all
in
the
day
work
he
merely
trades
out
his
own
blows
upon
his
wife
and
children
indeed
it
is
commonly
said
that
most
villeins
are
so
numb
mentally
they
never
can
comprehend
the
simplest
orders
unless
they
are
driven
home
with
stripes
in
time
of
war
the
fate
of
the
peasants
is
as
we
have
seen
far
worse
than
this
whatever
a
feud
means
to
the
contending
parties
to
their
villeins
it
means
houses
and
crops
burned
fruit
trees
girdled
young
girls
dragged
off
to
a
life
of
infamy
and
probably
the
massacre
of
many
peasants
in
cold
blood
one
of
the
reasons
the
nobles
delight
so
in
war
is
because
it
is
seldom
that
they
have
to
endure
its
real
anguish
and
horror
but
in
the
churches
the
pray
us
to
quite
as
fervently
as
they
beseech
save
us
from
famine
and
with
equal
justice
the
monkish
preachers
who
make
a
business
of
scolding
sometimes
denounce
oppressors
of
the
villeins
one
monk
thus
cries
out
all
that
the
peasant
amasses
in
one
year
of
stubborn
toil
the
noble
devours
in
an
hour
not
content
with
his
lawful
revenues
he
despoils
them
by
illicit
exactions
as
wolves
devour
carrion
while
the
crows
croak
overhead
awaiting
their
share
of
the
feast
so
when
knights
pillage
their
subjects
the
provosts
their
agents
and
others
of
the
hellish
crew
rejoice
at
the
prospect
of
devouring
the
remainder
or
again
ye
nobles
are
ravening
wolves
therefore
shall
ye
howl
in
hell
for
you
despoil
your
subjects
and
live
on
the
blood
and
sweat
of
the
poor
jacques
of
vitry
nevertheless
the
selfsame
preachers
accuse
the
peasants
of
the
cardinal
sins
of
avarice
and
of
shunning
labor
only
rarely
are
the
villeins
comforted
by
being
told
that
if
they
work
faithfully
and
bring
up
a
proper
family
they
are
morally
on
equality
with
a
cleric
who
chants
all
day
in
a
church
on
the
aliquis
fiefs
and
indeed
on
many
others
these
grosser
abuses
do
not
obtain
but
nowhere
are
the
villeins
exempt
from
one
evil
which
they
must
meet
with
dumb
resignation
the
seigneurial
hunts
conon
and
his
guests
never
hesitate
at
going
with
horses
and
hawks
or
hounds
straight
across
plowed
and
seeded
fields
or
even
over
standing
grain
this
is
the
lord
absolute
right
and
protest
is
impossible
the
hunters
too
are
entitled
if
far
from
home
to
stop
at
the
peasants
huts
and
demand
food
and
fodder
perhaps
for
a
large
party
if
payment
is
made
it
is
merely
out
of
charity
greater
evils
still
may
come
from
the
depredations
of
the
wild
game
if
the
fields
are
close
to
the
hunting
preserves
villeins
can
not
harm
any
deer
nibbling
the
young
sprouts
they
can
only
scare
them
away
and
the
cunning
creatures
soon
grow
daring
a
wild
boar
can
root
up
a
dozen
little
farm
plots
before
the
baron
can
find
leisure
to
chase
him
down
upon
some
fiefs
the
peasants
can
arrange
to
pay
an
extra
fee
to
their
lord
in
return
for
which
he
keeps
only
rabbits
near
their
fields
but
the
hunt
of
a
single
rabbit
if
the
flying
wretch
doubles
in
among
the
corn
may
ruin
a
family
on
the
other
hand
the
penalties
for
poaching
for
killing
game
are
terrible
it
is
probably
safer
on
aliquis
as
on
any
other
fief
to
risk
killing
a
traveler
than
killing
a
fawn
or
even
a
hare
the
law
is
pitilessly
enforced
by
the
foresters
maître
denis
will
tell
you
he
has
hanged
more
stout
fellows
for
poaching
than
for
any
other
two
crimes
put
together
sidenote
futile
peasant
revolts
do
the
villeins
ever
revolt
sometimes
when
they
are
driven
to
desperation
by
extreme
misery
when
they
find
a
clever
leader
when
circumstances
are
peculiarly
favorable
then
may
come
the
sudden
burning
of
manor
houses
and
small
fortalices
the
massacre
of
their
inmates
and
other
brutish
deeds
of
tardy
retaliation
the
rebels
are
likely
to
boast
as
did
some
insurgent
peasants
in
normandy
in
the
eleventh
century
we
have
been
weak
and
insane
to
bend
our
necks
for
so
long
for
we
are
men
and
solider
and
stouter
limbed
than
the
nobles
will
ever
be
for
everyone
of
them
there
are
a
hundred
of
us
such
revolts
always
have
a
single
end
the
ignorant
peasants
submit
to
no
discipline
they
can
not
use
the
knight
weapons
if
they
capture
them
they
can
not
organize
if
they
seize
a
castle
the
liquor
in
the
cellars
lays
them
out
helpless
through
a
week
of
orgy
the
seigneurs
instantly
rally
and
with
their
great
horses
hunt
down
the
rebels
as
creatures
worse
than
wolves
the
vengeance
then
taken
on
the
insurgents
is
such
that
every
ear
that
hears
thereof
must
tingle
perhaps
along
a
league
of
roadway
a
corpse
will
be
swinging
from
every
tree
such
measures
effectively
discourage
rebellion
save
under
most
exceptional
circumstances
even
with
atrocious
seigneurs
it
is
usually
best
to
bow
to
the
will
of
god
and
merely
to
pray
for
deliverance
georges
and
alard
mental
horizons
can
be
imagined
they
have
on
rare
occasions
been
as
far
as
pontdebois
although
some
of
their
neighbors
have
passed
a
lifetime
without
even
that
privilege
they
have
only
the
most
limited
one
might
say
only
the
most
animal
hopes
and
fears
their
ideas
of
such
things
as
the
king
court
paris
and
the
various
christian
and
infidel
lands
are
a
jumble
of
absurd
notions
religion
means
a
few
prayers
a
few
saints
stories
as
told
in
the
church
the
miracle
plays
at
christmas
and
a
fear
lest
by
failing
in
proper
respect
to
monks
and
priests
they
will
be
eternally
tormented
in
worse
torture
chambers
than
old
baron
garnier
the
villeins
of
course
have
their
own
rustic
holidays
full
of
rough
sports
wrestling
throwing
weights
archery
and
also
cockfighting
and
bull
baiting
the
best
of
entertainment
is
when
two
blindfolded
men
each
carrying
a
cudgel
try
to
kill
a
goose
or
pig
let
loose
in
an
inclosure
the
whole
village
roars
to
see
them
belabor
each
other
during
the
wedding
festivities
to
show
their
dutiful
esteem
for
alienor
and
olivier
the
peasants
had
arranged
a
special
ceremony
in
their
honor
four
blindfolded
men
were
led
about
the
neighborhood
preceded
by
two
men
one
playing
an
oboe
the
other
carrying
a
red
banner
whereon
a
pig
was
painted
after
this
noisy
merrymaking
a
real
pig
was
produced
and
before
an
august
company
of
most
of
the
castle
folk
the
four
champions
attacked
the
pig
they
hit
one
another
so
hard
that
one
was
picked
up
almost
dead
the
pig
became
the
property
of
the
villein
who
had
managed
to
pound
the
life
out
of
the
creature
just
as
in
mercy
alienor
was
about
to
beg
that
the
contest
end
despite
grievances
and
grumblings
the
average
peasants
are
loyal
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
dumb
dogs
to
their
seigneurs
conon
and
adela
command
the
real
affection
of
their
villeins
because
of
acts
of
charity
but
even
baron
garnier
had
been
treated
with
an
astonishing
faithfulness
many
a
knight
has
owed
his
life
or
honor
to
humble
dependents
whom
he
has
not
treated
so
well
as
his
horses
or
hounds
it
is
the
toiling
thousands
in
the
little
thatched
huts
that
make
possible
the
wedding
feasts
the
adubbements
the
tourneys
and
the
spectacular
battles
some
day
the
exploitation
will
cease
but
not
in
the
thirteenth
century
footnotes
this
cleric
jacques
of
vitry
may
have
written
a
few
years
later
than
the
presumable
date
of
this
narrative
but
it
represents
entirely
the
orthodox
viewpoint
of
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
rural
population
of
france
in
the
thirteenth
century
was
almost
as
great
as
in
the
twentieth
there
was
probably
a
decided
falling
off
in
the
fourteenth
century
thanks
to
the
black
death
and
the
ravages
of
the
hundred
years
war
by
these
wholesale
famines
were
really
becoming
matters
of
tradition
thanks
to
better
transportation
and
better
methods
of
agriculture
very
lean
years
almost
ruinous
to
the
peasantry
remained
however
as
extremely
grim
possibilities
in
brittany
and
somewhat
less
generally
in
normandy
most
of
the
peasants
at
this
time
were
free
in
champagne
and
central
france
there
were
still
so
many
serfs
that
very
possibly
the
peasants
of
aliquis
were
more
fortunate
than
the
majority
of
the
villeins
on
neighboring
baronies
the
advantages
of
the
free
peasants
over
the
serfs
have
however
been
somewhat
exaggerated
the
list
of
curious
required
of
peasants
on
various
seigneuries
is
a
long
one
on
one
fief
they
were
expected
to
beat
the
water
of
the
castle
moat
to
stop
the
noise
of
the
frogs
whenever
the
mistress
was
sick
or
on
certain
specified
occasions
they
had
to
perform
some
absurd
service
to
hop
on
one
leg
to
kiss
the
latch
of
the
castle
gate
go
through
some
drunken

displayed
by
the

for

in

to
fling
the

merely
to
satisfy
this
hungry
rabble
among
the
virtues
of
conon
and

the
fact
that
they
throw
the

with

this
somehow
adds
to
the

the
present

is
prosperous
at

furthermore
there
has
just
been
such
an
open
house
at
the
castle
that
one
would
expect
even
the
most
luckless
to
be
satiated
for
a
while
nevertheless
the

day
after

is
informed
that
there
are
more
than
thirty
people
before
the
drawbridge
chanting
their
alms
for
the
sake
of

the
baroness
suppressing
a
sigh
quits
her

is
just
assigning

immediately
recognizes

the
excitement
of

has
attracted

gensenius
scan
closely
this
melancholy
fellow
on

possibly
can
run
very
fast
if
he
sees
that

are
after
him
his
companion
who
seems
covered
with
sores
and
who
claims
to
be
on
a
pilgrimage
to
a
healing
shrine
is
clearly
a
scamp
and
malingerer
right
before
the
baroness
a
strange
woman
falls
down
foaming
at
the
mouth
as
if
she
had

gensenius
shakes
his

impostor
he
whispers
who
tried
her
trick
with
a
bit
of
soap
yesterday
in
the

so
the
sheep
gradually
are
separated
from
the
goats
some
of
the
charlatans
are
chased
away
some
of
those
who
receive
loaves
of
bread
and
broken
meat
are
perhaps
no
more
deserving
than
the
rejected
but
dare
one
really
be
too
critical
after
all
the
reason
why
great
folk
give
to
beggars
is
to
cancel
sins
if
the
beggars
are
undeserving
that
hardly
diminishes
the
credit
with
the
saints
for
conon
and
adela
it
would
be
calamitous
if
there
were
suddenly
to
be
no
poor
worthy
or
unworthy
for
how
then
by
parting
with
some
of
their
abundance
could
the
rich
buy
peace
for
their
souls
fortunately
however
there
is
no
such
danger
our
lord
has
directly
said
the
poor
ye
have
always
with
you
a
most
comforting
word
of
scripture
poverty
then
is
a
blessed
institution
even
for
the
fortunate
in
this
world
it
enables
them
to
procure
entrance
to
heaven
by
acts
of
charity
as
for
persons
who
are
needy
of
course
if
they
bear
their
lot
with
christian
resignation
they
accumulate
a
blessed
stock
of
indulgence
which
will
cut
short
their
durance
in
purgatory
sidenote
physical
severity
of

life
the
morning
dole
is
a
regular
feature
at
aliquis
as
at
every
other
castle
and
monastery
the
amount
of
food
given
away
is
really
very
great
but
there
is
next
to
no
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
average
seigneury
really
to
remedy
this
mendicancy
to
devise
honest
work
within
the
capacities
of
the

or
the
lame

give
systematic
relief
to

with

of

that
of

themselves
the

has
not
given
any
too
great
encouragement
to

the
mighty
ambrose
has
said
that
the
proper
healing
is
by
prayers
and
vigils
only
clerics
of
the
inferior
orders
are
allowed
to
study

the
dissection
of

discountenanced

the

take
place

he

has
considerable
skill
in
setting
fractures
and
cauterizing
and
salving

as
well
as

a
few
powerful

one
of
the

own

is
seriously
sick
it
is
usual
to
send
to
pontdebois
for
a
professional
physician
about
two
years
ago
conon
himself
fell
into
a
fever
they
brought
to
him
maître
payen
who
claimed
to
have
learned
his
art
as
by
travel
among
the
schools
of
medicine
at
salerno
in
sicily
at
montpellier
in
the
languedoc
country
and
even
at
cordova
among
the
infidels
although
the
baron
swore
angrily
after
he
was
gone
that
he
had
never
been
nearer
any
of
these
places
than
paris
illustration
a
doctor
restored
by
from
a
manuscript
in
the
bibliothèque
nationale
maître
payen
was
sprucely
dressed
half
as
a
priest
half
as
a
rich
burgher
he
wore
elegant
furs
he
talked
very
learnedly
of
febrifuges
and
humors
and
kept
repeating
thus
says
avincenna
the
prince
of
spanish
physicians
or
thus
says
albucasis
the
infallible
follower
of
avincenna
if
conon
had
suffered
from
some
easily
discoverable
malady
probably
maître
payen
could
have
suggested
a
fairly
efficient
means
of
cure
he
was
not
without
shrewdness
and
in
his
chest
was
a
whole
arsenal
of
herbs
and
drugs
he
had
also
efficient
salves
although
he
had
never
heard
the
word
antiseptic
but
the
baron
had
picked
up
one
of
those
maladies
which
baffled
easy
diagnosis
maître
payen
therefore
fussed
about
clearly
betraying
his
bewilderment
then
struck
a
professional
attitude
and
announced
oracularly
the
obstruction
to
health
is
in
the
liver
nay
groaned
the
baron
it
is
in
the
head
that
i
feel
so
wretched
that
is
foolish
retorted
the
crushingly
beware
of
that
word
because
you
do
not
understand
what
it
signifies
he
next
muttered
certain
cabalistic
words
said
that
the
baron
should
be
glad
that
his
liver
was
affected
because
that
was
the
seat
of
honor
and
that
upon
recovery
his
honor
would
be
enlarged
the
spleen
was
the
seat
of
laughter
while
the
lungs
fanned
the
heart
payen
then
talked
of
remedies
perhaps
the
urine
of
a
dog
would
be
best
or
the
blood
of
a
hegoat
but
these
were
only
villein
remedies
messire
the
patient
was
a
great
noble
and
needed
noble
remedies
suitable
for
his
rank
he
would
therefore
since
the
liver
was
affected
give
him
the
dried
and
pulverized
liver
of
a
toad
and
so
he
left
his
medicines
took
a
gold
piece
and
departed

night
conon
was
delirious
but
adela
who
like
every
mistress
of
a
castle
had
perforce
learned
much

applied
cold
cloths
to
his
body
while
father
grégoire
prayed
to
the
saints
the
next
morning
because
of
the
cloths
the
saints
or
toad
liver
the
fever
abated
perhaps
it
had
merely
run
its
natural
course
after
the
baron
recovered
he
would
curse
terribly
at
mention
of
maître
payen
he
would
be
ready
enough
to
cry
amen
to
the
saying
of
the
monk
guy
of
provins
they
the
physicians
kill
numbers
of
the
sick
and
exhaust
themselves
to
find
maladies
for
everybody
woe
to
him
who
falls
into
their
power
i
prefer
a
capon
to
all
their
mixtures
the
monk
concedes
indeed
that
certain
physicians
are
useful
but
that
it
is
because
of
the
confidence
which
they
inspire
rather
than
thanks
to
their
medicines
that
they
effect
cures
sidenote
healing
relics
and
processions
when
next
conon
falls
sick
he
vows
that
he
will
trust
simply
to
maître
louis
or
even
to
maître
denis
although
he
may
consent
to
send
for
a
lazarist
monk
a
member
of
the
great
monastic
order
which
makes
a
specialty
of
healing
the
sick
for
although
these
truly
noble
monks
who
combine
worldly
wisdom
with
an
equal
amount
of
piety
treat
especially
leprosy
they
are
gradually
turning
their
attention
to
diseases
in
general
if
he
can
not
get
a
lazarist
he
will
be
likely
to
hire
in
an
astrologer
to
discover
a
remedy
by
consulting
the
stars
or
father
grégoire
may
organize
a
healing
procession
of
all
the
monks

laymen

he
can
muster
with

will
carry
the
whole

them

upon

but
in
this
case
his
body
is
frequently
burned

idea
is
thus
to
mortify

followers
of
mahound
the
false
prophet
the
baron
frequently
denounces
the
arrogance
and
covetousness
of
the
clergy
and
resists
their
pretentions
but
he
nevertheless
trusts
them
to
supply
him
with
the
sacraments
and
bless
his
death
and
burial
so
that
his

may
pass
promptly
through

into
paradise
where
existence
presumably
is
one
grand
admixture
of
a
marriage
feast
in

fine
garden
and
of
a
magnificent
tournament
plenty
of
knights
are
lax
and
blasphemous
but
they
hardly
are

illustration
a
group
of
priests
thirteenth
century
the
one
who
is
near
the
altar
is
wearing
a
chasuble
and
the
second
and
third
are
clad
in
the
dalmatica
or
deacon
gown
the
second
carries
the
consecrated
wafer
and
the
third
a
sort
of
fan
from
a
manuscript
in
the
bibliothèque
nationale
when
conon
prays
in
the
morning
if
not
hurried
he
lies
down
with
his
head
turned
toward
the
east
and
his
arms
stretched
out
like
a
cross
he
recites
the
favors
which
god
has
shown
him
in
the
past
beseeches
heaven
to
continue
favorable
often
he
adds
a
credo
and
a
certain
paraphrase
of
the
lord
prayer
then
very
common
our
father
who
desirest
that
we
all
be
saved
grant
that
we
acquire
thy
love
even
as
have
the
angels
who
do
thy
pleasure
on
high
and
give
us
our
daily
bread
for
the
soul
the
holy
sacrament
and
for
the
body
its
needful
sustenance
yet
if
his
mood
is
not
unusually
humble
and
contrite
he
is
likely
to
conclude
patronizingly
and
i
confide
also
in
the
strength
of
my
heart
which
thou
hast
bestowed
in
my
good
sword
and
my
fleet
horse
yet
especially
in
thee
many
a
cavalier
breaks
into
blasphemies
when
things
go
wrong
such
men
are
like
william
rufus
of
england
who
cried
god
shall
never
see
me
a
good
man
i
have
suffered
too
much
at
his
hands
or
henry
ii
who
on
learning
that
his
son
henry
had
revolted
cried
aloud
since
thou
o
god
hast
taken
away
from
me
that
which
i
prized
the
most
thou
shalt
not
have
what
thou
prizest
most
in
me
my
soul
and
even
conon
once
when
hard
beset
had
exclaimed
like
a
certain
crusading
lord
what
king
o
lord
ever
deserted
thus
his
men
who
will
trust
in
or
fight
for
thee
nevertheless
one
should
deal
mercifully
with
such
sinful
words
for
after
all
is
not
the
world
very
evil
and
the
temptation
to
rail
at
god
extremely
great
it
is
true
that
things
are
not
as
they
were
in
the
year
when
even
the
wisest
felt
very
sure
the
last
day
was
at
hand
eclipses
comets
and
famines
had
then
seemed
foreshadowing
this
people
crowded
the
churches
in
agony
expecting
to
hear
the
seven
trumpets
announce
antichrist
repeatedly
since
then
when
the
years
have
been
calamitous
monks
and
old
wives
have
stirred
multitudes
by
vehement
predictions
that
the
plagues
of
the
apocalypse
and
the
other
preliminaries
to
the
millennium
are
not
to
be
delayed
as
late
as
the
monk
rigord
at
the
abbey
of
denis
wrote
the
world
is
ill
it
grows
so
old
that
it
relapses
into
infancy
common
report
has
it
that
antichrist
has
been
born
at
babylon
and
that
the
day
of
judgement
is
nigh
sidenote
a
fearful
excommunication
fears
like
this
restrain
even
reckless
seigneurs
and
sodden
peasants
from
proceeding
to
inconceivable
crimes
the
agonies
of
the
damned
will
be
so
dreadful
the
preachers
understand
very
well
that
it
is
of
little
use
to
try
to
restrain
the
wicked
by
talking
of
the
love
and
mercy
of
god
if
king
philip
had
only
used
love
and
mercy
upon
his
vassals
he
would
be
now
a
king
without
a
kingdom
it
is
the
dread
of
the
eternal
burning
which
apparently
keeps
a
large
part
of
all
christendom
tolerably
obedient
to
the
more
essential
mandates
of
morality
and
of
the
church
when
a
great
criminal
deliberately
defies
the
church
there
is
a
ceremony
which
makes
even
the
righteous
inquire
as
to
their
own
salvation
a
few
months
ago
a
certain
impious
baron
robbed
a
parish
church
of
a
chalice
instantly
at
pontdebois
the
bishop
took
action
the
great
bell
of
the
cathedral
tolled
as
for
a
funeral
and
such
it
was
though
of
the
soul
far
more
precious
than
merely
the
body
the
bishop
appeared
in
the
chancel
with
all
his
clergy
each
cleric
held
a
lighted
candle
the
building
was
hung
with
black
tapestry
amid
a
terrible
hush
the
bishop
announced
the
name
of
the
offending
knight
to
the
crowded
nave
then
proclaimed
in
loud
voice
let
him
be
cursed
in
the
city
and
cursed
in
the
field
cursed
in
his
granery
his
harvest
and
his
children
as
dathan
and
abiram
were
swallowed
up
by
the
gaping
earth
so
may
hell
swallow
him
and
even
as
we
quench
these
torches
in
our
hands
so
may
the
light
of
his
life
be
quenched
for
all
eternity
unless
he
do
repent
whereat
all
the
priests
dashed
their
torches
to
the
pavement
and
trampled
them
out
one
could
almost
see
that
sacrilegious
baron
writhing
in
the
flames
of
gehenna
after
a
scene
like
this
there
is
no
reinstatement
for
the
sinner
save
by
some
great
act
of
penance
and
mortification
an
excommunicated
person
is
next
door
to
an
outlaw
he
may
find
sundry
companions
in
crime
but
most
people
will
shun
him
as
they
would
a
leper
this
particular
baron
after
vain
boasts
and
defiance
at
last
was
so
and
forsaken
that
he
made
an
abject
peace
with
the
bishop
first
he
gave
ruinously
costly
gifts
to
the
cathedral
then
he
presented
himself
barefoot
and
in
the
robe
of
a
pilgrim
at
the
chancel
he
prostrated
himself
and
for
a
day
and
a
night
remained
in
prayer
before
the
high
altar
eating
and
drinking
nothing
after
that
he
knelt
again
while
some
clerics
and
monks
present
each
smote
him
with
a
rod
he
crying
aloud
just
are
thy
judgments
o
lord
after
every
blow
not
till
all
this
was
accomplished
did
the
bishop
raise
him
pronounce
the
absolution
and
give
him
the
kiss
of
peace
it
was
very
dreadful
for
lesser
offenses
against
the
church
there
are
lesser
but
effective
penalties
in
pontdebois
there
was
once
a
religious
procession
in
lent
a
certain
woman
marched
therein
with
pretended
devoutness
but
then
went
home
and
in
defiance
of
the
dined
upon
some
mutton
and
ham
the
odor
escaped
into
the
street
the
woman
was
seized
and
the
bishop
condemned
her
to
walk
through
the
town
with
her
quarter
of
mutton
on
the
spit
over
her
shoulder
the
ham
slung
round
her
neck
and
with
a
ribald
crowd
of
course
trailing
behind
after
that
penance
the
fasts
were
well
kept
in
pontdebois
sidenote
festive
side
of
popular
religion
yet
one
must
not
think
of
the
religion
of
this
feudal
age
as
in
general
sad
on
the
contrary
by
one
of
those
abrupt
contrasts
now
grown
familiar
clergy
and
people
get
vast
joy
not
to
say
amusement
even
out
of
the
sacred
ordinances
men
go
gayly
along
the
road
to
salvation
for
example
the
great
pilgrimages
pardons
are
often
festive
reunions
with
merchants
chaffering
and
jongleurs
playing
or
doing
their
tricks
while
the
whole
company
proceeds
to
some
shrine
even
in
the
church
building
solemnity
is
not
always
maintained
the
choir
indeed
belongs
pretty
strictly
to
worship
but
in
the
nave
all
sorts
of
secular
proceedings
can
go
on
even
the
meetings
of
malcontent
factions
and
of
rioters
the
church
bells
ring
for
markets
for
musters
or
for
peaceful
gatherings
almost
as
often
as
they
ring
for
the
holy
services
as
for
the
sacred
festivals
good
bishops
complain
that
they
are
so
numerous
that
the
secular
element
intrudes
utterly
and
disfigures
them
with
idleness
and
carousing
the
peasants
may
go
to
early
mass
after
that
they
will
drink
chatter
sing
dance
in
a
very
riotous
fashion
and
join
in
wrestlings
races
and
archery
contests
until
nightfall
besides
these
ordinary
abuses
of
holy
things
every
parish
seems
to
have
its
own
special
reign
of
folly
although
the
name
of
the
celebration
varies
from
place
to
place
even
the
younger
clergy
participate
in
such
mock
ceremonies
in
pontdebois
the
subdeacons
elect
a
pope
of
buffoons
give
him
a
silver
tiara
and
enthrone
him
with
much
dignity
electing
at
the
same
time
several
cardinals
to
help
direct
his
revels
there
are
noisy
processions
cavalcades
and
even
scandalous
parodies
of
some
of
the
most
sacred
services
of
the
church
the
mock
pope
issues
bulls
enjoining
all
kinds
of
horseplay
and
actually
strikes
a
kind
of
lead
money
with
such
legends
as
live
merrily
and
rejoice
or
fools
are
sometimes
wise
it
seems
next
to
impossible
to
confine
such
proceedings
to
the
streets
the
market
place
and
the
church
porch
although
decent
bishops
fight
against
intrusions
into
the
holy
building
the
canons
of
the
cathedral
have
finally
induced
the
junior
clergy
and
the
lay
rabble
to
refrain
from
the
more
extreme
parodies
and
from
such
pranks
as
stealing
the
church
bells
by
giving
the
pope
and
all
his
noisy
rout
a
grand
dinner
pious
churchmen
groan
on
such
days
but
they
comfort
themselves
by
saying
that
these
proceedings
make
religion
popular
and
give
an
outlet
for
the
flesh
which
if
restrained
too
much
will
succumb
before
even
worse
temptations
of
the
devil
in
aliquis
village
the
parish
priest
actually
participates
in
a
ceremony
equally
calculated
to
astonish
another
age
on
a
certain
sunday
the
folk
celebrate
the
virtues
of
the
ass
which
bore
our
lord
and
the
holy
virgin
when
joseph
fled
with
them
into
egypt
the
peasants
take
the
best
ass
in
the
neighborhood
caparison
it
gayly
and
lead
it
through
the
streets
to
the
church
all
the
children
running
along
waving
flower
wands
and
shouting
with
the
older
folk
almost
equally
demonstrative
at
the
holy
portal
the
priest
meets
them
and
announces
in
latin
this
is
a
day
of
mirth
let
all
sour
lookers
get
themselves
hence
away
with
envy
those
who
celebrate
the
festival
of
the
ass
desire
jollity
sidenote
mass
of
the
ass
then
the
ass
is
led
straight
up
into
the
chancel
and
tethered
to
the
altar
rail
a
solemn
prose
half
latin
half
french
is
chanted
setting
forth
the
virtues
of
the
faithful
stolid
beast
which
enabled
our
lord
to
escape
the
wicked
herod
ever
and
anon
the
cantor
stops
and
all
the
crowded
church
rings
with
the
refrain
haw
sire
ass
he
haw
everybody
trying
to
pull
down
his
nose
and
bray
as
lustily
as
possible
finally
when
the
ass
has
been
led
decorously
back
to
his
stall
the
choristers
with
many
friends
indulge
in
a
bountiful
repast
this
festival
of
the
ass
is
celebrated
in
very
many
french
cities
and
villages
one
must
also
comprehend
that
certain
saints
are
the
particular
patrons
of
given
regions
martin
is
a
potent
saint
through
all
france
but
denis
is
the
especial
guardian
of
the
royal
domains
nicholas
of
lorraine
andre
of
burgundy
and
of
course
george
of
england
michael
too
may
assist
french
knights
sooner
than
he
will
foreigners
there
are
also
many
local
saints
of
incalculable
sacredness
in
their
own
small
regions
yet
hardly
heard
of
elsewhere
thus
if
you
travel
very
far
you
are
likely
to
lose
all
trace
of
good
aliquis
and
indeed
peevish
visitors
have
suggested
that
he
has
never
been
canonized
at
rome
or
properly
accepted
by
the
catholic
church
for
all
that
he
is
venerated
locally
perhaps
with
greater
fervor
than
any
other
holy
one
saving
always
our
blessed
lady
herself
there
is
no
saint
with
whom
it
is
possible
to
compare
the
virgin
she
is
the
lady
of
heaven
the
queen
of
the
holy
city
the
god
the
father
and
god
the
son
seem
perhaps
to
be
inaccessible
celestial
emperors
but
the
holy
virgin
who
understands
the
needs
of
toiling
men
will
transmit
their
pleas
and
exert
her
vast
influence
in
their
behalf
therefore
on
her
statues
she
is
dressed
like
a
feudal
queen
with
rich
stuffs
a
crown
glittering
with
jewels
and
she
bears
a
royal
scepter
and
an
orb
of
the
world
all
the
saints
are
her
vassals
and
do
her
liege
homage
there
is
another
set
of
joyous
celebrations
legitimate
and
uplifting
at
christmas
time
on
eve
the
good
folk
will
install
a
heifer
an
ox
and
an
ass
in
the
parish
church
to
warm
the
holy
babe
with
their
breath
torches
are
lighted
everywhere
and
fires
are
lit
upon
the
hills
groups
of
people
march
about
dressed
like
shepherds
bound
for
the
christchild
manger
and
led
by
pipes
and
viols
while
all
sing
joyously
good
sirs
now
hark
ye
from
far
lands
come
we
for
it
is
noël
then
in
the
church
are
sung
long
responses
telling
the
story
of
christmas
in
the
vernacular
and
interspersed
with
comments
by
the
animals
in
latin
because
as
says
the
hymn
all
the
beasts
in
other
days
spoke
french
less
well
than
latin
so
the
cock
crows
out
his
satisfaction
the
goat
bleats
the
calf
bellows
the
ox
lows
the
ass
brays
it
is
all
done
simply
reverently
and
for
the
benefit
of
simple
loving
souls
in
pontdebois
however
they
have
a
more
elaborate
performance
twelve
clerks
representing
six
jews
and
six
pagans
present
themselves
in
the
cathedral
choir
declaring
they
wish
to
examine
the
evidence
that
the
babe
newly
born
is
truly
the
redeemer
whereat
appear
in
stately
sequence
all
the
prophets
who
have
forewarned
the
coming
of
christ
besides
moses
with
his
horn
balaam
with
his
ass
the
three
hebrew
children
of
the
fiery
furnace
the
pagan
sybils
and
the
twelve
apostles
each
responds
with
canticles
in
sonorous
latin
until
the
twelve
doubters
declare
themselves
satisfied
and
fall
down
to
worship
the
infant
king
sidenote
mystery
plays
at
easter
there
are
other
mystery
plays
telling
the
story
of
the
divine
passion
and
of
the
resurrection
and
still
others
come
at
intervals
through
the
year
some
of
the
participants
are
priests
but
many
others
laymen
both
men
and
women
all
the
more
important
episodes
in
the
bible
are
acted
out
with
considerable
detail
and
with
much
comedy
interspersed
the
crowds
howl
with
glee
when
ananias
like
a
shrewd
jew
chaffers
for
the
sale
of
his
field
or
when
hideous
devils
leap
up
from
hell
to
seize
herodias
daughter
the
instant
she
has
accomplished
her
wicked
will
with
john
the
baptist
there
is
no
attempt
to
represent
ancient
times
herod
is
dressed
like
a
feudal
duke
and
before
him
is
carried
a
crucifix
the
numerous
devils
are
always
black
the
angels
wear
blue
red
and
white
god
appears
wearing
a
papal
tiara
and
the
souls
of
the
dead
appear
covered
with
veils
white
for
the
saved
red
or
black
for
the
damned
it
is
a
source
of
great
delight
for
the
people
to
take
part
in
these
plays
and
even
the
great
folk
are
not
above
joining
in
them
one
need
not
comment
on
how
completely
such
proceedings
impress
the
imaginations
of
the
unlearned
with
the
stories
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
the
bible
can
be
only
by
the
few
but
an
essential
part
of
it
is
and
reasonably
comprehended
by
the
many
so
much
for
ordinary
religious
beliefs
and
occasions
but
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
find
their
sins
are
so
terrible
that
they
must
resort
to
some
great
penances
often
consuming
the
remainder
of
their
lives
in
order
to
propitiate
heaven
besides
the
monks
and
the
nuns
dwelling
in
convents
there
exist
a
great
many
hermits
and
religious
solitaries
who
abide
in
little
huts
in
the
woods
perhaps
maintaining
a
tiny
chapel
for
travelers
and
being
fed
on
the
offerings
of
forest
rangers
and
peasants
not
all
these
hermits
live
however
in
genuine
solitude
right
in
aliquis
village
there
is
something
everywhere
common
a
female
recluse
many
years
ago
a
certain
peasant
woman
elise
murdered
her
husband
she
was
promptly
condemned
to
the
gallows
but
baron
garnier
with
unusual
mercy
pardoned
her
on
condition
that
she
be
shut
up
within
a
small
house
in
the
cemetery
that
she
might
there
do
penance
and
so
end
her
days
a
stone
hut
was
accordingly
built
and
the
unhappy
woman
conducted
thither
with
a
regular
procession
two
priests
blessing
the
hut
and
giving
elise
a
kind
of
consecration
she
was
put
inside
every
aperture
was
then
built
up
except
a
narrow
chink
to
admit
air
a
little
light
and
a
small
dole
of
food
from
her
relatives
elise
has
been
vegetating
in
this
hut
for
now
twenty
years
living
in
filth
and
darkness
but
talking
most
piously
to
visitors
standing
outside
seemingly
she
does
little
except
to
mutter
almost
incessant
prayers
already
her
crime
is
forgotten
the
peasants
speak
of
her
as
that
holy
woman
and
even
wonder
whether
after
she
dies
in
her
cell
for
she
will
never
leave
it
she
can
not
be
enrolled
among
the
saints
there
are
many
other
much
more
innocent
recluses
male
and
female
who
have
been
walled
up
voluntarily
either
out
of
piety
or
of
sheer
love
of
idleness
possibly
because
of
both
sidenote
recluses
and
pilgrims
nevertheless
ordinarily
the
best
way
to
discharge
the
load
of
a
guilty
conscience
is
by
pilgrimage
confessors
often
impose
this
means
of
penance
upon
penitents
as
the
best
way
of
winning
the
divine
mercy
since
death
is
about
the
only
judicial
penalty
for
great
crimes
a
penance
of
pilgrimage
for
six
ten
or
twelve
years
going
from
shrine
to
shrine
all
over
christendom
is
really
a
substitute
for
a
term
of
imprisonment
pilgrims
of
this
pronounced
type
are
required
to
go
barefoot
with
head
shaved
to
quit
their
families
and
wives
and
to
fast
continually
that
is
never
to
touch
meat
more
than
once
a
day
even
exalted
nobles
thus
spend
the
remainder
of
a
lifetime
expiating
their
iniquities
everyone
has
heard
of
count
fulk
the
black
of
anjou
who
heaped
up
misdeeds
even
to
the
murdering
of
his
wife
then
at
last
he
realized
the
awful
peril
to
his
soul
three
times
he
made
the
long
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
the
third
time
letting
himself
be
dragged
upon
a
hurdle
through
the
streets
of
the
sacred
city
while
two
varlets
smote
him
with
whips
such
great
criminals
often
carry
passports
issued
by
bishops
certifying
that
they
are
expiating
by
pilgrimage
specified
evil
deeds
and
requesting
christian
folk
to
give
them
lodging
food
and
assistance
these
penitents
if
knights
are
likely
to
wear
chains
upon
their
wrists
and
neck
forged
of
their
own
armor
as
witnesses
at
once
of
their
social
position
and
their
genuine
repentance
most
pilgrims
however
have
no
such
fearful
things
weighing
down
their
souls
they
are
simply
ordinary
erring
men
who
are
moved
by
a
genuine
piety
possibly
admixed
with
a
willingness
to
find
excuse
for
seeing
the
world
every
day
they
appear
at
the
gate
of
aliquis
castle
to
ask
a
share
in
the
supper
and
a
bed
on
the
rushes
in
the
hall
and
they
are
respectfully
treated
although
conon
sometimes
complains
that
their
trailing
robes
of
brown
wool
heavy
staffs
and
sacks
slung
at
belt
are
merely
the
disguises
for
so
many
wandering
rogues
unwashed
and
unkempt
though
many
of
them
are
it
never
does
to
repulse
them
lest
you
lose
the
scriptural
blessing
for
those
who
received
strangers
and
so
have
entertained
angels
unawares
pilgrims
too
are
good
newsmongers
they
supply
you
with
tidings
from
italy
germany
spain
or
even
the
holy
land
they
will
carry
letters
also
to
foreign
parts
and
transmit
verbal
messages
to
kinsmen
they
do
not
always
travel
alone
but
by
twos
fives
or
even
tens
recently
at
dunkirk
where
the
peasants
revolted
the
bishop
laid
upon
of
their
leaders
the
penance
that
they
should
spend
a
year
going
about
in
a
body
to
different
holy
places
and
joining
in
religious
processions
in
churches
wearing
no
clothing
save
their
trousers
going
barefoot
and
carrying
the
rods
with
which
they
had
been
disciplined
innumerable
are
the
shrines
where
sinners
can
profit
their
souls
by
a
visit
every
important
abbey
claims
to
be
a
pilgrimage
resort
and
the
monks
will
tell
of
remarkable
miracles
wrought
by
all
the
saints
whose
relics
they
chance
to
treasure
probably
there
are
more
than
a
thousand
such
places
whose
claims
have
been
somewhat
recognized
by
the
church
many
of
these
shrines
have
some
famous
image
of
the
madonna
frequently
brought
from
the
east
by
crusaders
but
often
very
old
and

carnal

as
is
well

the
blessed
saints
both
in

life
and
after
death
wrought
many
miracles
through
their
relics
these
wonders
continue
although
the
iniquities
of
mankind
render
them
infrequent
every
now
and
then
heaven
still
permits
some
holy
man
to
work
undoubted
miracles
thus
only
recently
it
is
said
that
when
the
venerable
abbot
of
germer
preached
the
fourth
crusade
in

he
need
only
bless
a

related
in

only
the
other

when
this
abbot
reached
a
village
which
wanted
a
supply
of
water
he
gathered
all
the
folk
in
the
church
right
in
the
presence
of
the
people
he
smote
a
stone
with
his
staff
and
water
flowed
forth
not
merely
potable
but
healing
for
all
maladies
god
also
speaks
to
us
in

as
he
did
to
pharaoh

nebuchadnezzar
he
caused
thomas

to

warn
him
to
make

to

it
is
not
always
clear
whether
sent
from

or
the
devil
a
few
years
ago
the
wolves
in
the
forest
near
the
monastery
of
aliquis
howled
steadily
all
through
the
day
of
the
feast
of
honore
a
clear
sign
of
trouble
announced
the
prior
and
four
days
later
the
feud
began
betwixt
conon
and
foretvert
which
convulsed
the
whole
countryside
many
a
man
is
warned
to
prepare
for
death
by
seeing
a
in
the

a
shooting
star
or
a
vulture
hovering
above
his
house
if
thirteen
people
chance
to
sit
at

table
or
if
one
chances
to
dream
of
a
physician
it
is
proof
positive
some
one
in
the
house
is
about
to
die
the
same
is
true
if
a
man
inadvertently
puts
on
a
clean
white
shirt
on
friday
while
if
the
left
eye
of
a
dead
man
will
not
close
promptly
the

any

also

thoughtlessly

her

during
the

not
long
for
this

it
is
needless
to
explain
how
sinister
are
eclipses

was
a
great
comet
visible

people
wagged
their
heads
with
melancholy
satisfaction
when
richard
the
lion

died
very
soon
after
time
will
fail
to
list
all
the
strange
beings
neither
human
angel
nor
exactly
devil
that
providence
permits
to
infest
the
world
these
creatures
possess
no
souls
and
when
they
perish
are
gone
like
cattle
although
they
live
long
and
are
very
hard
to
kill
probably
they
are
more
numerous
in
wild
and
solitary
places
yet
towns
and
crowded
castles
are
not
free
from
them
thus
there
are
fairies
good
and
bad
creatures
relatively
like
human
beings
undines
in
the

who
by
their
perfidious
beauty
lure
unwary
knights

who
disinter

rise
every
night

suck
the

humans
turned
into
beasts
who
attack
lonely
travelers
dracs
who
carry
off
little
children
to
their
subterranean
realms
in
the
marshes
who
are
the
souls
of
unbaptized
dead
infants
also
many
rather
friendly
spirits
such
as
the
who
sometimes
overnight
do
a
weary
work
for
him
it
needs
much
knowledge
to
tell
the
good
spirits
from
the
bad
to
know
whether
you
are
dealing
with
a
goblin
who
will
only
display
harmless
antics
or
an
a
real
imp
of
darkness
who
may
hug
you
like
a
bear
to
suffocation
the
church
does
not
forbid
the
belief
in
these
creatures
nor
of
such
pagan
monsters
as
giants
pygmies
cyclops
satyrs
tritons
sirens
although
it
plainly
teaches
us
that
they
are
only
ministers
of
the
devil
the
existence
of
the
devil
is
as
certain
as
that
of
the
holy
trinity
as
has
been
said
already
the
fear
of
falling
into
his
clutches
has
often
a
more
excellent
effect
upon
the
sinner
than
the
love
of
god
countless
legends
and
sculptures
in

cathedrals
tell
all
about
the
the

the

for
all
his
brave
words
and
his
long
sword
the

his
castle
all
tremble
lest
they
meet
him
the
devil
produces
all
kinds
of
misery
and
he
can
actually
take
possession
of
the
living
bodies
of
men
it
is
affirmed
that
once
not
far
from
aliquis
a
knight
was
sitting
peaceably
at
table
when
suddenly
the
devil
entered
into
him
the
fiend
spoke
through
the
poor
man
mouth
he
raved
and
uttered
blasphemies
the
priest
brought
his
book
of
exorcisms
when
he
recited
them
the
devil
screamed
horribly
yet
for
some
days
he
resisted
the
holy
formulas
and
then
departed
leaving
his
victim

exhausted

it
is
much
worse
when
you
make
a
direct
pact
with
the
devil
some
time
ago
it
is
affirmed
there
was
a
young
scholar
at
paris
he
was
much
troubled
because
he
progressed
slowly
in
his
studies
then
satan
visited
him
saying
do
me
homage
i
will
make
you
excel
in
wisdom
he
gave
the
youth
a
stone
asserting
that
so
long
as
you
hold
this
stone
in
your
hand
you
will
know
everything
soon
the
lad
astonished
the
schools
by
his
erudition
but
on
falling
sick
confessed
his
crime
threw
away
his
stone
and
at
once
forgot
all
his
learning
speedily
he
died
at
once
the
devils
began
to
torture
his
soul
but
god
promptly
sent
an
angel
ordering
them
to
let
alone
this
soul
which
you
have
tormented
immediately
the
soul
flew
back
into
the
body
which
sprang
to
life
even
as
the
paris
students
were
celebrating
the
funeral
service
the
revived
scholar
however
at
once
entered
a
convent
and
took
no
more
chances
with
carnal
studies
very
many
people
however
have
compounded
with
the
devil
and
been
less
fortunate
the
fiend
apparently
will
not
come
unless
one
is
in
a
desperate
plight
and
willing
to
promise
everything
then
usually
the
unhappy
mortal
must
deny
the
christian
faith
repudiate
the
saints
utter
blasphemies
and
it
is
even
asserted
kiss
the
arch
fiend
upon
the
buttocks
next
a
horrid
oath
must
be
taken
standing
inside
of
three
magic
circles
and
burning
incense
after
that
the
devil
will
it
is
true
give
his
votary
great
worldly
prosperity
and
especially
riches
through
a
long
life
but
in
the
end
the
fiend
never
fails
to
claim
his
soul
for
an
eternal
possession
it
is
even
said
that
satan
made
such
a
bargain
with
the
great
ecclesiastic
gerbert
who
became
pope
sylvester
ii
he
was
very
wise
or
very
wicked
probably
both
and
in
the
opinion
of
many
he
rose
to
be
pope
by
the
aid
of
a
hierarchy
of
demons
and
a
brass
idol
which
uttered
oracles
but
on
the
day
of
his
death
satan
demanded
his
own
and
whenever
a
pope
lies
near
his
end
the
bones
of
sylvester
ii
rattle
in
the
tomb
the
church
discredits
this
scandalous
story
but
it
is
widely
believed
since
the
recent
trial
of
a
witch
and
a
wizard
before
the
bishop
at
pontdebois
the
folk
near
aliquis
have
gained
a
much
more
precise
knowledge
of
the
black
art
magicians
usually
begin
their
ceremonies
by
creating
a
magic
smoke
of
various
inflammables
and
spices
also
by
burning
such
ingredients
as
the
brain
of
an
eagle
the
blood
of
a
black
cat
and
plenty
of
hellebore
the
smoke
thus
created
is
so
dense
and
foul
that
uninitiated
customers
are
readily
convinced
there
are
demons
rising
in
the
vapor
and
talking
to
the
wizard
thanks
to
such
assistance
the
magician
and
his
even
more
sinful
wife
the
witch
were
able
to
instruct
how
to
find
a
pot
of
gold
and
how
to
rob
the
house
of
a
rich
jew
but
especially
they
could
prepare
philters
some
of
them
intended
to
inspire
love
and
others
hatred
wives
could
buy
fearful
compounds
made
of
substances
from
the
three
domains
of
nature
the
entrails
of
animals
scales
of
fishes
parings
of
nails
human
blood
pulverized
and
such
powerful
drugs
as
mandragora
which
if
duly
brewed
and
beaten
up
together
then
put
in

unfaithful
husband

would
win
back

such

these
dealers
in
the
black

at

could
also
sell

had

over

protecting
the

from

the
witch
and
wizard
also
possessed
undoubtedly
the
evil
eye
which
if
resolutely
fixed
on
an
ox
or
sheep
would
cause
it
to
perish
and
was
almost
as
dangerous
to
human
beings
however
the
twain
were
presently
ruined
thus
showing
how
fickle
a
protector
is
the
devil
because
a
certain
silly
nobleman
got
them
to
overcast
a
knightly
enemy
against
whom
he
lacked
the
courage
to
press
an
honorable
war
after
the
wizard
had
burned
much
incense
the
witch
had
proceeded
to
shape
a
puppet
of
virgin
wax
as
much
like
the
victim
as
possible
then
with
a
shameless
parody
of
the
baptismal
service
she
christened
the
doll
with
the
name
of
her
patron
enemy
next
the
wizard
placed
the
livers
of
swallows
under
the
armpits
and
upon
the
place
where
the
heart
of
the
puppet
ought
to
be
finally
he
and
his
wife
pierced
the
wax
image
with
needles
then
cast
it
into
a
blazing
fire
chanting
all
the
while
cabalistic
words
probably
beseeching
the
special
help
of
the
devil
inevitably
soon
after
this
the
knight
thus
assailed
would
have
sickened
and
died
had
not
by
the
mercy
of
god
the
whole
proceeding
been
discovered
the
knight
was
saved
by
the
powerful
exorcisms
of
the
bishop
the
wizard
after
proper
tortures
to
get
confession
was
buried

his

was
burned
the
foolish

had
plotted
murder
saved
his
life
for
he
had
powerful
relatives
but
was
condemned
to
go
on
a
pilgrimage
to

certain
fatuous
women
who
had
bought

philters
were
publicly
rebuked
in

and
spent

in

pillory
good
christians
hope
that
it
will
be
a
long
day
before
the
black
art
is
again
practiced
so
iniquitously
in
this
part
of
france
nevertheless
there
are
some
forms
of
divining
which
the
church
counts
as
innocent
any
time
you
desire
you
can
consult
the
holy
books
with
proper
prayer
and
circumspection
you
should
open
the
bible
at
random
and
note
the
tenor
of
the
first
passage
that
meets
your
eye
is
it
favorable
to
your
condition
or
unfavorable

pious

use

method
to
see
what
the
omens
are
concerning
a
candidate
for
a
bishopric
according
to
jongleurs
tales
even
popes
thus
seek
for
an
oracle
ere
taking
any
important
step
in
the
government
of
the
church
although
these
stories
are
wisely
doubted
a
more
precise
method
of
augury
is
the
sentences
expressing
sentiments
good
or
bad
are
written
on
parchment
a
string
is
attached
to
each
and
allowed
to
protrude
while

up
you

prayer
seize
a

at

then
follow
it
down
to
read
its
sentiment
in
this
way
the
saints
and
not
the
devil
will
reveal
the
future
to
you
undoubtedly

peasants
carry
their

universal
adoration
of
relics
there
is
one
pious
matter
shared
in
alike
by
great
and
humble
and
highly
approved
by
the
church
although
the
wiser
ecclesiastics
deprecate
some
of
its
excesses
the
worship
of
holy
relics
saints
relics
abound
where
is
the
monastery
church
or
even
castle
without
them
sometimes
they
rest
in
golden
caskets
in
the
very
place
where
the
holy
personages
departed
this
life
sometimes
they
have
been
brought
from
rome
or
palestine
by
pious
pilgrims
very
often
they
come
as
gifts
the
direct
purchase
of
relics
is
somewhat
sacrilegious
but
you
can
present
a
king
duke
or
great
ecclesiastic
with
a
good
relic
just
as
you
give
him
some
hawks
or
ermine
skins
as
a
reward
for
favors
past
or
expected
the
pope
is
always
sending
desirable
relics
to
bishops
and
abbots
whom
he
wishes
to
honor
and
as
all
know
after
the
latins
sacked
constantinople
in
there
was
hardly
a
shrine
in
all
france
which
did
not
get
the
skull
a
few
ribs
or
even
the
entire
body
of
some
eastern
saint
the
booty
in
relics
in
fact
was
almost
as
important
as
that
of
gold
and
jewels
possessing
relics
is
most
desirable
prayers
said
near
them
have
extra
efficacy
oaths
taken
upon
their
caskets
are
doubly
binding
but
sometimes
the
holy
objects
are
surreptitiously
removed
when
the
pledge
is
being
given
it
is
then
no
perjury
to
break
the
promise
in
dealing
with
slippery
individuals
one
must
therefore
beware
on
the
other
hand
who
is
ignorant
of
the
manner
in
which
william
the
norman
inveigled
harold
the
into
taking
a
great
oath
of
fealty
the
englishman
swore
to
the
pact
believing
the
casket
on
which
he
rested
his
hands
contained
relics
of
very
inferior
worthies
who
could
never
punish
him
if
he
perjured
himself
but
the
instant
the
words
were
said
the
priests
opened
the
sacred
box
showing
it
full
of
the
bones
of
the
most
powerful
saints
imaginable
harold
turned
pale
with
horror
realizing
how
he
had
been
trapped
when
later
he
broke
his
oath
beyond
a
doubt
it
was
these
angered
saints
who
wrought
his
death
at
hastings
good
relics
also
imply
a
source
of
income
provided
that
they
are
properly
advertised
so
as
to
make
the
church
or
abbey
possessing
them
a
pilgrimage
resort
sometimes
indeed
one
fears
lest
overzealous
monks
exaggerate
the
miracles
wrought
by
the
relics
at
their
abbey
church
the
tale
runs
that
when
the
abbey
of
vanne
was
deeply
in
debt
the
abbot
asserted
our
debts
will
all
be
paid
with
the
red
tunic
of
vanne
a
relic
i
never
doubt
it
the
monks
at
aliquis
are
proud
of
their
collection
although
by
no
means
the
largest
in
the
region
they
have
two
teeth
of
the
prophet
amos
hairs
of
martin
and
leonard
parings
of
the
martyrs
of
the
theban
legion
bits
of
the
robe
of

finger
bones
of
saints
saturnin
sebastian
and
of
the
patriarch
jacob
a
fifth
rib
of
amond
a
skull
of
one
of
the
holy
innocents
a
chip
of
the
stone
on
which
christ
stood
when
he
ascended
to
heaven
the
jaw
bone
of
sixtus
some
of
the
hay
from
the
manger
of
bethlehem
and
last
but
not
least
a
splinter
of
the
true
cross
the
mere
adoration
of
such
things
cancels
many
grievous
years
in
purgatory
it
is
advantageous
to
the
whole
region
to
have
such
a
collection
if
there
is
need
of
rain
the
relics
can
be
carried
in
procession
around
the
thirsty
country
and
relief
is
sure
to
follow
if
there
is
a
public
assembly
the
holy
relics
can
be
brought
in
before
the
contending
knights
or
burghers
wise
counsels
will
ensue
if
you
are
going
on
a
journey
a
visit
to
a
shrine
with
such
relics
almost
guarantees
a
safe
return
we
have
already
seen
how
conon
as
did
other
knights
kept
certain
relics
always
in
his
sword
hilt
to
confirm
his
oaths
and
to
lend
efficacy
to
his
actions
sidenote
contests
over
relics
the
enormous
value
of
such
sacred
things
often
makes
them
the
booty
of
thieves
thus
in
a
band
of
robbers
stole
the
remains
of
leocadia
from
the
abbey
of
vic
and
when
pursued
cast
the
holy
bones
into
the
aisne
whence
they
were
rescued
with
serious
difficulty
we
need
not
multiply
records
of
similar
crimes
profligate
noblemen
will
sometimes
seize
and
keep
very
sacred
relics
in
their
castles
as
talismans
against
justice
not
less
miraculous
is
the
manner
in
which
the
relics
have
been
preserved
when
less
sacred
objects
have
been
lost
this
is
indeed
a
divine
mystery
not
lightly
to
be
inquired
into
when
however
two
identical
relics
of
the
same
saint
are
displayed
in
france
how
are
worldly
questionings
to
be
silenced
for
surely
the
holy
men
of
old
had
only
one
head
and
two
arms
apiece
not
long
since
the
monks
of
étienne
exhibited
a
skull
of
denis
but
the
monks
of
denis
claimed
had
the
skull
of
their
own
patron
saint
already
what
lack
of
charity
ensued
the
backbiting
did
not
cease
till
the
great
pope
innocent
iii
tactfully
silenced
the
controversy
without
actually
deciding
which
relic
was
the
more
authentic
many
say
that
such
relics
can
miraculously
duplicate
themselves
so
that
are
equally
genuine
and
undoubtedly
god
has
worked
far
greater
wonders
than
this
nevertheless
such
is
the
sinfulness
of
men
that
spurious
relics
are
often
imposed
upon
the
faithful
good
churchmen
do
zealous
work
in
exposing
these
sacrilegious
frauds
not
long
since
father
grégoire
had
conon
give
a
terrific
flogging
to
a
pretended
pilgrim
who
was
trying
to
sell
the
credulous
peasants
a
bit
of
the
sail
of
peter
boat
and
a
feather
of
the
angel
gabriel
it
is
more
serious
when
a
spurious
shrine
is
set
up
near
lyons
recently
the
peasant
women
insisted
in
venerating
the
tomb
of
st
guinefort
it
was
discovered
to
be
only
the
spot
where
a
lady
had
buried
a
favorite
greyhound
in
another
case
many
years
ago
the
great
martin
found
near
tours
a
chapel
where
the
people
worshiped
a
supposed
martyr
the
saint
stood
on
the
sepulcher
and
prayed
reveal
unto
me
who
is
really
here
soon
a
dark
form
arose
and
the
specter
confessed
to
martin
i
am
a
robber
my
soul
is
in
hell
but
my
body
is
in
this
sepulcher
the
saint
therefore
destroyed
the
chapel
and
saved
many
from
wasting
their
prayers
and
substance
it
is
a
dangerous
business
however
to
be
concerning
popular
relics
even
great
churchmen
such
as
the
late
bishop
of
orléans
are
liable
to
be
mobbed
if
they
call
an
alleged
and
skull
of
génevieve
the
head
of
some
old
woman
as
once
did
that
astute
prelate
nevertheless
the
authorities
try
to
do
their
duty
pope
innocent
iii
has
issued
a
formal
warning
to
the
french
clergy
against
accepting
spurious
relics
and
the
monks
of
every
monastery
never
hesitate
to
dispute
the
authenticity
of
almost
every
kind
of
a
relic
provided
only
it
is
deposited
in
a
neighboring
and
rival
abbey
sidenote
translations
of
relics
if
however
relics
are
genuine
it
is
impossible
to
exaggerate
their
desirability
they
are
produced
on
numerous
holidays
and
often
a
special
holiday
is
proclaimed
when
they
are
translated
then
you
may
see
the
relics
of
some
saint
being
carried
through
the
streets
of
a
village
or
town
the
holy
objects
themselves
borne
in
their
golden
boxes
under
a
canopy
accompanied
by
all
the
local
clergy
with
perhaps
the
barons
and
the
duke
of
the
entire
region
being
allowed
to
assist
the
highest
prelates
in
carrying
or
at
least
in
escorting
the
sacred
casket
thus
has
been
explained
certain
features
of
the
religion
of
the
laity
humble
and
exalted
at
length
we
can
approach
one
of
those
great
institutions
which
have
built
up
the
strength
of
catholic
christianity
a

from
the

if
he

not

his

he
cares
not
to

for
there
go
those
aged
priests
and
those
old

and
the
maimed
who
all

and
there
go

two
or

this
was
blasphemous
enough
but
it
was
not
atheistical
this
was
very
much
like

then
they

then
there
are
cries

slurring

not

the

thrust

the

the
things
for

there

the
monastery
of
aliquis
has
existed
for
centuries
it
is
a
benedictine
monastery
that
is
to
say
its
rule
system
of
government
and
discipline
comes
from
the
famous
benedict
of
nursia
who
lived
in
italy
in
the
sixth
century
many
new
orders
of
monks
have
been
founded
since
then
but
none
more
holy
than
the
benedictines
when
they
really
live
up
to
the
ideals
of
their
founder
barons
of
aliquis
and
other
rich
people
have
endowed
the
monastery
from
time
to
time
with
ample
lands
it
is
a
passing
wealthy
institution
ignorant
folk
of
other
ages
may
think
of
a
monastery
as
a
collection
of
idlers
meditating
on
heaven
and
living
on
charity
such
groups
once
perhaps
existed
in
eastern
lands
but
never
in
a
benedictine
monastery
each
is
the
scene
of
a
very
busy
life
many
industries
are
carried
on
the
monks
are
almost
the
monastery
in
fact
contributes
more
to
the
economic
life
of
the
region
than
does
the
castle
and
abbot
victor
its
head
is
hardly
less
important
even
in
a
worldly
sense
than
messire
conon
with
whom
happily
he
is
now
on
cordial
terms
sidenote
the
abbey
buildings
the
monastery
however
is
an
establishment
distinctly
set
off
by
itself
it
is
in
the
world
but
not
of
it
as
you
travel
from
the
castle
you
presently
enter
fields
unusually
well
cultivated
these
are
part
of
the
abbey
lands
then
you
come
to
a
small
village
comparatively
clean
and
well
built
where
the
lay
servitors
of
the
monks
live
with
their
families
then
straight
ahead
there
rises
a
strong
battlemented
wall
of
wide
circuit
surrounded
by
a
moat
beyond
this
wall
appear
the
spires
and
pinnacles
of
pretentious
buildings
the
wall
is
needed
to
stand
off
attacks
of
bands
of
godless
men
who
dream
even
of
plundering
convents
there
are
a
drawbridge
portcullis
and
strong
gate
inside
you
are
within
a
little
world
the
center
is
not
the
donjon
but
the
new
monastery

an
elegant
structure
almost

fruit

skill
one
even
sees
a

convenient
corner
a
tannery
at

can
be
spun

anything

with

that

plus
the

is
enough
for

has
been
said
the
focus
for
its
entire

is
the

without
a

building
a
monastery
is
almost
impossible
the

is
constantly
needed
for
the
recitation
of
the
canonical
hours
many
altars
are
required
so
that
the
monks
who
are
in
holy
orders
may
celebrate
mass
frequently
while
the
great
processions
around
the
nave
are
part
of
the
routine
especially
on
sundays
abbot
victor
like
all
his
predecessors
is
straining
every
nerve
to
gather
funds
to
beautify
his
church
in
it
are
deposited
invaluable
saints
relics
it
is
hard
however
to
convince
the
laity
that
they
are
extremely
sacred
unless
they
are
lodged
in
a
splendid
edifice
the
monks
of
rival
monasteries
are
always
comparing
their
churches
enviously
victor
has
set
his
heart
upon
widening
the
transepts
and
putting
in

rose
window

only
a
certain
pious
heiress
in

would

the

would
declare

was
possessed
by
a
devil
although
these

are
now
becoming
more
common
it
has
a
dial
marking
the
twelve

by
an
ingenious
system
of

and
weights
indicates
when
it
is
noon
or
midnight
without
reference
to
the
shifting
of

or
movement
of

it
even
has
bells

ring
every

are
almost
as
proud
of

of
the
establishment
if
aliquis
had
been
a
cistercian
convent
following
the
rule
of
bernard
of
clairvaux
its
structures
would
have
been
extremely
plain
no
mosaics
stained
glass
silken
hangings
or
floral
carvings
in
the
church
nor
anything
else
calculated
to
distract
the
monks
from
thinking
upon
the
heavenly
mysteries
said
he
austerely
works
of
art
are
idols
which
lead
away
from
god
and
are
good
at
best
to
edify
feeble
souls
and
the
worldly
bernard
was
a
mighty
saint
but
all
do
not
follow
this
hard
doctrine
the
monks
of
aliquis
for
their
own
part
are
sure
that
the
heavenly
ones
are
rejoiced
every
time
they
add
a
new
stone
leaf
to
the
unfading
foliage
about

the
monks

are

if
they
had
been
cistercians
they
would
have
been

that

the
cowl
is
a
cumbersome
garment
enveloping
the
whole

it
is
worn
only
at
ceremonies
ordinarily
the
monks
wear
black

the

control
of

with
the
abbot
under
the
monastic
rule
and
vows
the
monks
owe
him
implicit
obedience
if
he
is
a
practical
efficient
man

whole
establishment
is
happy
and

if
the
reverse
it
is
soon
in

property
is
wasted
the
monks
live
evilly
or
desert
and
the
whole
place
often
is
ruined
abbeys
resemble
seigneuries
they
are
either
growing
or
dwindling
many
church
canons
forbid
abbots
to
abuse
their
office
to
live
luxuriously
to
waste
the
abbey
property
or
to
take
important
steps
without
consulting
the
older
monks
but
such
decrees
are
hard
to
enforce
fortunately
the
head
of
aliquis
abbot
victor
is
a
moderate
kindly
yet
withal
a
worldly
wise
man
he
was
the
younger
son
of
a
petty
noble
and
was
thrust
into
the
monastery
somewhat
because
his
worldly
heritage
would
have
been
very
small
the
monastic
life
however
agreed
with
him
he
became
popular
with
the
brethren
of
peasant
stock
yet
never
let
them
forget
that
his
parents
had
been
gentle
as
prior
he
knew
how
to
deal
with
conon
and
other
seigneurs
when
the
old
leader
died
there
had
been
one
cry
from
all
the
monks
assembled
in
the
chapter
house
let
victor
be
our
abbot
since
then
despite
inevitable
grumblings
he
has
ruled
acceptably
avoiding
alike
cistercian
severity
and
that
lax
rule
which
has
made
certain
monasteries
the
hatching
nests
of
scandal
victor
wears
on
ceremonial
occasions
a
miter
with
gold
fringe
although
it
can
not
be
adorned
with
pearls
like
a
bishop
he
has
also
handsome
gloves
especial
emblems
of
his
office
a
crozer
a
pastoral
staff
and

his
administration
is
aided
by
a
whole

of
officers
first
of

named
by
the
abbot
and

chief
lieutenant
who
is
his
superior
deputy
and

man
of

next
the
subprior
the
third
in

then
the
third
and
fourth
priors
known
as

they
have
to
make
frequent

of

while
below
them
come
the
in

of
the
singing
and

the
responsible
for
the
bells
lights
and

of
the
church
and
all
the
heads
of
the
kitchen

and
monastery
finances
there
is
also
the
garnerer
a
sagacious
monk
who
collects
the
grain
due
from
the
abbey
lands
and
either
sells
it
profitably
or
turns
it
over
to
the
storekeeper
sidenote
routine
of
the
monks
day
the
activities
of
the
monks
are
multifarious
but
everything
is
really
subordinate
to
the
duty
of
chanting
the
holy
offices
in
the
church
the
brethren
go
to
bed
even
in
wintertime
at
sunset
then
by
the
light
of
cressets
bowls
of
oil
with
floating
wicks
they
rise
at
midnight
put
on
their
clothes
sit
down
on
stone
seats
at
either
end
of
the
dormitory
and
next
file
in
silent
procession
to
the
great
dark
church
there
they
chant
a
long
service
with
the
organ
rumbling
under
the
gloomy
vaulting
a
service
made
still
longer
by
the
prayers
for
the
dead
as
solemnly
as
before
they
file
back
to
the
dormitory
and
sleep
until
daybreak
in
winter
until
actual
sunrise
in
summer
whereupon
they
all
rise
again
go
to
the
church
and
chant
prime
tierce
follows
about
sext
at
noon
nones
at
and
vespers
at
about
sundown
this
continues
every
day
through
a
long
life
no
wonder
the
monks
all
know
by
heart
their
offices
for
the
day
and
night
as
given
in
the
breviary
after
prime
a
meeting
is
held
in
the
chapter
house
a
section
is
read
from
the
rule
the
abbot
or
priors
call
off
the
work
for
each
monk
individual
complaints
can
be
uttered
and
corrections
and
public
reproofs
are
given
by
the
officers
at
the
tierce
service
mass
is
said
then
the
morning
work
goes
on
until
the
sext
after
which
the
first
regular
meal
is
eaten
although
some
bread
soaked
with
wine
is
allowed
earlier
to
the
weaker
brethren
talking
during
the
meal
is
discouraged
but
there
is
nevertheless
much
whispering
while
the
reader
allowed
to
eat
earlier
tries
to
center
attention
upon
the
pulpit
the
brethren
then
rise
and
sing
grace
ending
up
with
the
miserere
which
is
chanted
in
procession
marching
through
the
cloister
everybody
thereupon
retires
to
the
dormitory
and
enjoys
a
siesta
until
it
is
time
for
nones
work
is
next
resumed
until
vespers
just
before
supper
after
supper
there
is
another
meeting
in
the
chapter
house
with
more
reading
from
a
pious
book
then
once
more
to
the
church
to
chant
complines
after
that
since
aliquis
is
a
monastery
all
the
monks
are
compelled
to
go
straight
to
bed
and
do
not
sit
up
for
carnal
chatter
all
the
doors
of
the
establishment
are
securely
locked
the
officers
make
the
rounds
to
see
that
every
monk
is
safe
on
his
cot
and
so
the
whole
brotherhood
settles
for
the
night
life
in
the
monastery
thus
has
a
strict
routine
which
soon
becomes
a
perfect
habit
with
most
of
the
inmates
of
course
monks
working
in
the
fields
are
not
required
to
come
in
for
all
the
daytime
offices
they
can
drop
their
tools
when
the
great
bell
rings
and
pray
in
silence
reverently
standing
in
nunneries
about
the
same
divisions
of
time
are
applied
although
chaplains
have
to
come
in
to
say
mass
the
one
thing
impressing
every
visitor
to
a
monastery
is
the
intense
sense
of
order
as
compared
with
the
tumult
and
coarse
informality
characteristic
of
even
the
better
castle
to
a
certain
type
of
mind
this
regularity
is
indescribably
fascinating
apart
from
any
question
of
its
advantages
in
religion
to
ask
how
the
different
brethren
of
aliquis
come
to
enter
its
portals
is
to
ask
as
many
individual
questions
the
abbot
is
typical
of
many
companions
who
were
placed
there
because
worldly
prospects
were
small
and
because
they
were
decently
urged
by
their
relatives
sometimes
the
pressure
was
not
mild
there
are
a
few
brethren
who
seem
discontented
men
without
vocation
chafing
against
irrevocable
vows
taken
practically
under
compulsion
and
yearning
to
be
back
in
the
world
there
is
also
one
coarse
old
man
who
was
a
robber
knight
tonsure
or
the
scaffold
so
the
duke
had
put
the
question
to
such
a
person
the
monastery
is
nothing
but
an
honorable
prison
there
are
however
two
or
three
other
elderly
here
for
a
better
reason
they
have
been
overwhelmed
with
a
consciousness
of
their
crimes
and
are
genuinely
anxious
to
redeem
their
souls
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
monks
are
gentle
although
the
majority
are
if
of
the
latter
class
however
they
have
been
subjected
to
searching
scrutiny
before
entrance
to
make
sure
they
will
be
useful
members
of
the
community
if
they
are
mere
clownish
peasants
they
are
often
taken
only
as
lay
brethren
who
learn
a
few
prayers
but
spend
most
of
their
time
on
the
abbey
farms
and
who
do
not
sleep
in
the
dormitory
sidenote
reasons
for
becoming
monks
the
greater
number
of
the
monks
have
apparently
joined
voluntarily
in
early
manhood
because
they
are
repelled
by
the
confusion
and
grubbing
hardships
of
the
world
because
they
have
a
hankering
for
an
intellectual
life
and
because
they
are
genuinely
anxious
to
deliver
their
souls
after
a
round
of
fêtes
tournaments
and
forays
many
a
young
knight
has
suddenly
turned
from
them
all
announced
to
his
companions
what
profit
where
will
i
spend
eternity
said
farewell
to
his
beloved
destrer
and
knocked
at
the
convent
door
sometimes
he
has
sickened
too
late
of
his
choice
more
often
in
this
new
world
of
chants
solemn
offices
books
honest
toil
gently
spoken
words
and
quietness
he
has
discovered
a
satisfaction
not
possessed
by
his
brother
who
is
still
messire
the
seigneur
in
the
monastery
there
are
however
certain
very
young
boys
who
it
is
to
be
hoped
will
prove
contented
with
their
profession
their
parents
or
guardians
have
taken
them
to
the
abbot
and
in
their
ward
behalf
have
uttered
vows
that
bind
the
helpless
children
forever
i
offer
this
my
son
reads
the
formula
to
the
omnipotent
god
and
to
the
virgin
mary
for
the
salvation
of
my
soul
and
the
souls
of
my
parents
and
so
shall
he
remain
in
this
holy
life
all
his
days
until
his
final
breath
earnestly
do
the
wiser
brethren
pray
that
these
practically
orphaned
boys
do
not
become
a
source
of
sorrow
to
themselves
and
of
discord
to
the
community
in
future
years
aliquis
is
a
monastery
its
monks
however
point
with
some
pharisaical
satisfaction
at
certain
neighboring
establishments
it
is
well
said
that
ten
are
the
abuses
in
the
cloister
costly
living
choice
food
noise
in
the
cloister
strife
in
the
chapter
disorder
in
the
choir
a
neglectful
discipline
disobedient
youths
lazy
old
men
headstrong
monks
and
worldly
officers
it
is
alleged
that
all
these
evils
and
worse
ones
have
existed
in
the
monastery
of
ausonne
five
leagues
away
this
community
had
an
excellent
name
for
sanctity
until
twenty
years
ago
then
a
foolish
abbot
admitted
too
many
younger
sons
who
were
being
forced
in
by
their
relatives
the
duke
likewise
imprudently
pardoned
a
whole
gang
of
highwaymen
on
condition
that
they
should
turn
religious
also
several
cavaliers
deliberately
entered
the
order
in
sinful
expectation
that
family
influence
could
procure
their
election
as
abbots
or
bishops
posts
of
great
worldly
consequence
thus
it
was
that
our
old
enemy
satan
entered
into
ausonne
all
accounts
are
that
he
still
refuses
to
be
ejected
sidenote
a
disorderly
monastery
the
evil
tidings
of
this
convent
presently
spread
to
rome
and
the
holy
father
deeply
grieved
ordered
the
bishop
of
pontdebois
to
visit
the
establishment
and
restore
discipline
it
was
well
that
he
took
a
troop
of
armed
sergeants
with
him
or
he
would
have
been
stoned
by
the
furious
inmates
the
monks
of
aliquis
lift
their
hands
in
horror
at
the
least
of
the
stories
told
about
his
discoveries
part
of
the
bishop
report
reads
like
this
brother
regnaud
is
accused
of
great
uncleanness
of
life
bartholomée
a
cantor
assistant
often
gets
drunk
and
then
does
not
get
up
for
the
matins
service
roger
the
third
prior
frequents
taverns
jean
the
fourth
prior
is
an
habitual
tippler
morell
another
cantor
assistant
is
given
to
striking
and
evil
speaking
firmin
in
charge
of
the
abbey
lands
does
the
like
etc
these
charges
however
are
mere
details
the
real
sorrow
is
that
from
the
abbot
down
the
whole
organization
of
ausonne
has
fallen
utterly
away
from
the
monastic
ideal
of
a
school
for
the
lord
service
to
quote
benedict
the
abbot
has
been
not
merely
very
worldly
but
very
miserly
recently
a
jongleur
sought
hospitality
at
ausonne
the
monks
offered
him
merely
black
bread
and
water
although
their
own
supper
was
far
more
sumptuous
than
the
two
cooked
dishes
and
half
a
pint
of
wine
allowed
by
the
benedictine
rule
on
leaving
the
abbey
the
minstrel
met
the
abbot
returning
from
pushing
his
political
fortunes
at
paris
he
profusely
thanked
the
prelate
for
his
noble
hospitality
because
they
had
given
him
choice
wine
rich
dishes
and
finally
presented
him
with
good
shoes
and
a
belt
the
abbot
returned
home
in
a
rage
and
caused
his
guest
master
to
be
flogged
for
squandering
the
monastery
property
the
minstrel
of
course
spread
the
tale
of
his
revenge
and
so
indirectly
prompted
the
visitation
of
the
establishment
in
fine
the
bishop
reported
that
from
ausonne
many
monks
ranged
the
country
with
wandering
feet
as
mere
religious
vagabonds
levying
alms
upon
the
peasantry
and
sometimes
bearing
letters
from
their
abbot
allowing
them
to
quit
the
cloister
at
pleasure
the
abbot
himself
defying
the
canons
would
have
elaborate
hunting
parties
with
hawks
and
hounds
the
church
law
merely
permitted
monks
to
kill
rabbits
and
crows
dangerous
to
the
crops
but
the
bishop
actually
found
a
kennel
of
great
dogs
and
a
sheaf
of
boar
spears
within
the
holy
compound
the
dietary
at
ausonne
was
fit
for
a
castle
venison
was
served
on
friday
and
the
amount
of
wine
consumed
was
astounding
women
are
never
supposed
to
set
foot
within
the
inner
precincts
of
a
monastery
but
to
spare
the
church
further
scandal
one
conceals
what
the
bishop
discovered
to
be
the
practice
at
this
establishment
the
ausonne
monks
too
have
cast
reproaches
upon
their
more
honest
brethren
elsewhere
one
of
them
after
visiting
the
aliquis
convent
is
discovered
to
have
complained
one
can
not
talk
in
the
refectory
and
all
night
they
the
offices
in
the
church
the
meals
are
very
poor
they
give
us
beans
and
unshelled
eggs
the
wine
is
too
thin
and
too
mixed
with
cows
drink
water
no
never
will
i
get
drunk
on
wine
at
aliquis
it
is
better
to
die
than
to
live
another
brother
seems
to
have
drifted
round
the
duchy
visiting
the
more
disorderly
seigneurs
becoming
their
boon
companion
cozening
their
women
and
boasting
that
his
ideal
of
life
was
a
big
salmon
at
dinner
time
and
sitting
by
a
fountain
with
a
friendly
dame
with
such
monks
sheer
sacrilege
in
performing
the
sacred
offices
was
possible
the
story
goes
that
at
the
morning
office
they
were
all
very
drowsy
soon
their
heads
would
fall
on
the
service
books
at
the
close
of
every
line
the
choir
boys
were
expected
to
keep
up
the
chant
but
the
latter
impious
young
mortals
soon
learned
how
to
begin
quiet
games
the
moment
the
last
monk
had
fallen
asleep
then
when
the
proper
time
has
expired
the
boys
would
all
call
out
loudly
let
us
bless
the
lord
thanks
be
to
god
the
monks
would
respond
awakening
with
a
start
and
then
everybody
would
go
comfortably
away
sidenote
discipline
of
unruly
monks
the
report
of
the
bishop
will
probably
produce
one
of
two
orders
from
rome
either
the
holy
father
will
appoint
a
new
abbot
strictly
enjoined
to
rule
the
convent
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
to
restore
discipline
or
the
whole
establishment
will
be
broken
up
as
hopeless
and
its
inmates
distributed
around
among
other
and
stricter
monasteries
cases
as
bad
as
ausonne
are
rare
but
they
breed
infinite
scandal
and
provide
outrageous
tales
for
the
jongleurs
so
long
as
monasticism
exists
there
will
be
institutions
afflicted
with
idleness
and
luxury
the
lust
of
the
flesh
and
the
lust
of
the
eyes
and
the
pride
of
life
doubtless
no
monastery
is
exempt
from
evil
thoughts
and
evil
deeds
yet
it
is
pitiful
that
the
saints
allow
such
institutions
as
ausonne
to
exist
to
bring
into
contempt
the
tens
of
thousands
of
monks
who
are
trying
to
serve
god
with
sincerity
footnotes
in
these
chapters
the
terms
monastery
abbey
and
convent
are
used
synonymously
of
course
the
term
convent
from
conventus
or
meeting
might
also
be
used
for
nunnery
a
priory
was
usually
a
smaller
type
of
institution
ruled
by
a
prior
and
not
an
abbot
see
note
and
dependent
on
some
greater
abbey
clocks
run
wholly
by
weights
were
known
as
early
as

and
the
famous
magician

sylvester
ii
see
studied
their
mechanism
by
the
thirteenth
century
they
were
slowly
coming
into
general
use
of
course
at
first
they
had
only
one
hand
showing
merely
the
hours
by
its
very
nature
a
monastery
would
contain
a
disproportionately
large
number
of
doddering
old
men
or
sick
and
helpless
individuals
or
they
are
significantly
called
besides
a
monk
was
supposed
to
be
bled
for
his
health
four
or
five
times
a
year
while
recovering
from
this
operation
he
could
stay
in
the
infirmary
the
church
usually
rejected
candidates
for
regular
priesthood
who
labored
under
serious
physical
disabilities
the
monasteries
had
to
be
less
arbitrary
thus
they
probably
obtained
more
than
their
share
of
blind
purblind
halt
deaf
etc
in
at
an
abbey
near
boulogne
there
are
said
to
have
been
so
many
lame
or
monks
that
the
abbot
refused
to
admit
any
more
defectives
for
thirty
years
this
was
probably
an
extreme
case
for
similar
reasons
many
women
unmarriageable
through
physical
defects
seem
to
have
been
placed
in
nunneries
in
monasteries
affiliated
with
the
great
abbey
of
cluny
the
highest
officer
was
the
prior
the
only
abbot
for
the
entire
group
of
establishments
was
at
cluny
various
other
small
dependent
monasteries
had
merely
a
prior
supposedly
dependent
on
the
abbot
at
a
superior
monastery
while
such
children
would
be
sometimes
presented
out
of
motives
of
genuine
piety
to
save
their
own
souls
or
to
redeem
those
of
their
relatives
often
they
were
thrust
into
the
convent
merely
to
dispose
of
unwelcome
heirs
or
to
avoid
the
cost
of
rearing
them
wise
abbots
would
of
course
sift
out
such
cases
carefully
bishops
theoretically
had
themselves
the
right
of
inspection
unless
a
monastery
had
a
direct
papal
charter
but
in
any
case
the
monks
would
probably
resist
episcopal
interference
vigorously
unless
the
pope
gave
the
bishop
specific
orders
to
intervene
these
complaints
are
identical
with
those
actually
made
by
a
worldly
monk
who
visited

venerable
abbey
of
cluny
chapter
xx
the
monastery
of
aliquis
the
activities
of
its
inmates
monastic
learning
after
a
monk
has
taken
the
great
vow
renouncing
my
parents
my
brothers
my
friends
my
possessions
and
the
vain
and
empty
glory
of
this
world
and
renouncing
also
my
own
will
for
the
will
of
god
and
accepting
all
the
hardships
of
the
monastic
life
how
is
he
to
be
employed
for
as
benedict
with
great
sagacity
has
written
is
the
enemy
of
the
the
ancient
hermits
devoted
their
entire
time
to
contemplation
hoping
for
visions
of
angels
but
it
is
recorded
too
often
that
they
had
only
visions
of
the
devil
therefore
continues
the
holy
rule
at
fixed
times
the
brothers
ought
to
be
employed
with
manual
labor
and
again
at
fixed
times
in
sacred
reading
thus
in
general
the
monks
of
aliquis
are
busied
with
two
great
things
in
the
fields
and
with
the
copying
or
actual
writing
of
profitable
books
sidenote
bequests
to
monasteries
the
monastery
being
passing
rich
its
administration
constitutes
a
great
worldly
care
ever
since
the
institution
came
into
existence
about
the
time
that
heribert
rendered
the
region
fairly
safe
by
erecting
his
fortress
the
monks
have
been
adding
to
their
property
church
foundations
never
die
mortmain
prevents
them
from
crumbling
income
is
obtainable
from
many
sources
but
probably
the
best
lands
have
come
to
the
abbey
through
the
reception
of
new
members
few
novices
are
received
unless
they
make
a
grant
of
their
entire
possessions
to
the
institution
and
while
most
younger
sons
and
peasants
have
little
enough
to
give
every
now
and
then
the
abbey
receives
a
person
of
considerable
wealth
besides
such
acquisitions
there
is
no
better
way
for
laymen
to
cancel
arrears
with
the
recording
angel
than
by
gifts
of
land
or
money
to
an
abbey
some
of
these
gifts
come
during
lifetime
sometimes
on
one
deathbed
noblemen
complain
that
the
monks
thus
defraud
them
of
their
possessions
when
a
man
lies
down
to
die
bewails
the
epic
poem
hervis
de
metz
he
thinks
not
of
his
sons
he
summons
the
black
monks
of
benedict
and
gives
them
his
lands
his
revenues
his
ovens
and
his
mills
the
men
of
this
age
are
impoverished
and
the
clerics
daily
grow
richer
often
too
a
person
when
on
his
deathbed
will
actually
take
the
habit
and
be
enrolled
as
a
monk
thus
of
course
conveying
to
the
abbey
all
his
possessions
this
we
are
told
is
the
sweetest
way
for
a
human
conscience
to
settle
its
case
with
god
property
thus
comes
to
an
abbey
from
every
direction
no
gifts
are
refused
as
tainted
money
giving
to
heaven
is
invariably
a
pious
deed
and
ordinarily
justifies
whatever
oblique
means
were
used
to
get
the
donation
so
the
monks
of
aliquis
have
been
accumulating
tillage
lands
meadows
vineyards
and
often
the
rentals
for
lands
held
by
others
these
rentals
are
payable
in
wheat
barley
oats
cattle
and
also
in
pasture
rights
some
donations
are
given
unconditionally
some
strictly
on
condition
that
the
income
be
used
in
providing
alms
for
the
poor
lodgings
and
comforts
for
the
sick
or
saying
special
masses
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
the
benefactor
abbot
victor
has
therefore
to
supervise
many
farms
forests
mills
scattered
for
many
miles
about
he
also
receives
the
tithe
church
tax
for
five
or
six
parish
churches
in
the
region
on
condition
that
he
appoint
their
priests
and
support
them
out
of
part
of
this
income
for
these
lands
the
abbot
owes
feudal
service
and
over
them
he
exercises
feudal
suzerainty
possessing
therefore
an
overlord
and
also
vassals
just
as
did
the
nobles
who
held
these
same
fiefs
before
they
passed
to
the
abbey
he
is
accordingly
a
regular
seigneur
receiving
and
doing
homage
bound
to
do
justice
to
his
vassals
and
able
to
call
them
to
arms
whenever
the
secular
need
arises
by
church
law
he
can
not
of
course
lead
them
in
person
to
battle
but
has
to
accept
conon
as
his
advocate
and
it
is
as
advocate
or
as
called
elsewhere
of
the
abbey
of
aliquis
able
to
lead
its
numerous
retainers
into
the
field
and
act
in
military
matters
as
the
abbot
very
lieutenant
and
champion
that
the
baron
owes
much
of
his
own
importance
for
example
he
gets
one
third
of
all
the
fees
payable
to
the
abbey
for
enforcing
justice
among
its
dependents
and
when
he
is
himself
in
a
feud
he
will
sometimes
attempt
to
call
out
the
abbot
vassals
to
follow
his
personal
banner
even
if
the
quarrel
is
of
not
the
least
concern
to
the
monks
nevertheless
such
an
overpowerful
champion
is
usually
necessary
to
a
monastery
despite
the
fear
of
excommunication
unscrupulous
lords
frequently
seize
upon
abbey
lands
or
even
pillage
the
sacred
buildings
trusting
to
smooth
over
matters
later
by
a
gift
or
a
pilgrimage
the
temptation
presented
by
a
rich
helpless
monastery
is
sometimes
almost
irresistible
sidenote
monastic
industries
and
almsgiving
in
nonmilitary
matters
however
the
monks
control
everything
they
direct
the
agriculture
of
hundreds
of
peasants
they
maintain
real
industries
manufacturing
far
more
in
the
way
of
church
ornaments
vestments
elegant
woolen
tapestries
elaborate
book
covers
musical
instruments
enameled
reliquaries
as
well
as
carvings
in
wood
bronze
and
silver
than
they
can
possibly
use
for
their
own
church
all
this
surplus
is
sold
and
the
third
prior
has
just
returned
from
pontdebois
to
report
his
success
in
disposing
of
a
fine
bishop
throne
which
brother
octavian
who
has
great
skill
with
his
chisel
has
spent
three
whole
years
in
making
the
monks
also
maintain
a
school
primarily
for
lads
who
expect
to
become
clerics
but
which
is
open
also
to
the
sons
of
nobles
and
indeed
of
such
peasants
as
can
see
any
use
in
letting
hulking
boys
who
do
not
expect
to
enter
the
church
learn
latin
and
struggle
with
pothooks
and
hangers
the
monks
too
have
another
great
care
and
expense
the
distribution
of
alms
even
more
lavishly
than
at
the
castle
the
porter
is
bound
always
to
keep
small
loaves
of
bread
in
his
lodge
ready
to
give
to
the
itinerant
poor
every
night
swarms
of

to
be

by

night
when
questions
will
be
asked
in
bad
years
the
monasteries
are
somehow
expected
to
feed
the
wretched
by
thousands
all
this
means
a
great
drain
upon
the
income
even
if
the
monks
themselves
live
sparely
there
is
often
another
heavy
demand
made
on
the
abbot
revenues
having
so
many
and
such
varied
parcels
of
land
he
is
almost
always
involved
in
costly
lawsuits
with
rival
church
establishments
claiming
the
property
with
the
heirs
of
donors
who
refuse
to
give
up
their
expected
heritages
with
creditors
or
debtors
in
the
abbey
commercial
transactions
and
with
neighboring
seigneurs
he
who
has
land
has
trouble
is
an
old
proverb
to
which
victor
cheerfully
subscribes
he
is
not
so
litigious
as
many
abbots
but
his
time
seems
consumed
with
carnal
matters
which
profit
not
the
soul
the
activities
in
a
large
monastery
are
ample
enough
to
give
scope
to
the
individual
genius
of
about
all
the
brethren
although
every
abbey
is
likely
to
have
its
own
special
interests
some
south
french
monasteries
make
and
export
rare
cordials
and
healing
drugs
others
boast
of
their
horticulture
the
breeding
of
cattle
or
the
manufacture
of
various
kinds
of
elegant
articles
as
already
noted
however
the
mere
cultivation
of
the
fields
where
the
brethren
toil
side
by
side
with
the
lay
helpers
although
also
acting
as
overseers
consumes
the
energies
of
much
of
the
convent
the
remainder
of
the
time
of
most
monks
is
devoted
to
forms
of
learning
the
great
establishment
of
cluny
sets
the
proper
example
there
every
brother
at
least
while
he
is
young
must
practice
humility
by
digging
pulling
weeds
shelling
beans
and
making
bread
but
this
work
is
largely
for
discipline
if
he
has
the
least
inclination
he
will
soon
be
encouraged
to
devote
himself
to
copying
manuscripts
studying
books
perfecting
himself
in
latin
and
finally
in
actually
writing
original
latin
works
himself
sidenote
manuscript
copying
and
study
all
day
long
save
at
the
times
for
chanting
the
offices
the
older
brethren
and
many
of
the
younger
are
in
the
little
alcoves
round
the
cloister
conning
or
copying
huge
volumes
of
parchment
or
vellum
or
whispering
together
over
some
learned
problem
all
the
formal
literature
is
in
latin
it
was
until
recently
something
of
a
disgrace
to
prove
oneself
unclerkly
by
using
the
vulgar
tongue
romance
being
accounted
fit
only
for
worldly
noblemen
and
jongleurs

as
in
every
convent
monks
still
are
wont
to
argue
among
themselves
how
far
is
it
safe
to
study
pagan
rather
than
christian
writers
undoubtedly
horace
ovid
and
livy
are
a
delight
to
any
student
who
can
read
latin
what
wealth
of
new
ideas
what
marvelous
vigor
of
language
what
vistas
of
a
strange
wonderful
world
are
opened
to
the
imagination
unfortunately
however
all
these
authors
died
worshiping
demons
their
souls
are
in
hell
or
at
least
in
limbo

uppermost
and
least
painful
compartment
did
not
pope

write
to
a
bishop
who
was
fond
of
classical
studies
it
behooves
not
that
a
mouth
consecrated
to
the
praise
of
god
should
open
for
those
of
jupiter
did
not
odilon
abbot
of
cluny
renounce
his
beloved
virgil
the
most
favored
of
all
heathen
writers
after
a
warning
dream
beholding
therein
a
wondrous
antique
vase
which
as
he
reached
to
grasp
it
proved
full
of
writhing
serpents
nevertheless
the
pagan
authors
are
so
seductive
that
the
monks
persist
in
studying
them
although
always
with
a
guilty
feeling
that
stolen
waters
are
sweet
and
bread
eaten
in
secret
is
pleasant
in
the
monastery
school
advanced
instruction
is
given
to
the
younger
monks
as
well
as
to
the
very
few
laymen
who
have
been
through
the
primary
instruction
in
the
grammar
rhetoric
and
dialectics
the
art
of
reasoning
all
taught
of
course
in
latin
apt
pupils
are
then
encouraged
to
continue
under
one
or
two
monks
of
superior
learning
in
the
astronomy
arithmetic
geometry
and
music
systematic
instruction
is
hardly
ever
given
in
anything
else
although
odds
and
ends
of
certain
other
sciences
can
be
absorbed
around
aliquis
sidenote
books
of
learning
the
fundamental
textbooks
are
donatus
grammar
for
instruction
in
latin
and
then
for
almost
everything
savoring
of
real
learning
latin
translations
of
master
aristotle
for
a
long
time
the
monks
have
had
to
content
themselves
with
the
logical
works
of
the
famous
grecian
explaining
the
processes
of
argumentation
but
by
they
can
enjoy
the
enormous
advantage
of
using
latin
versions
of
the
physics
the
metaphysics
and
the
ethics
the
great
works
of
the
master
of
those
who
know
to
quote
dante
writing
eighty
years
later
some
of
these
books
have
come
directly
from
the
greek
but
others
have
been
distorted
by
passing
through
an
arabic
version
that
in
turn
has
been
made
over
into
latin
there
are
also
various
arabic
commentaries
of
considerable
value
curious
it
doubtless
is
that
heaven
who
has
denied
salvation
alike
to
greek
and
to
moslem
should
suffer
unbelievers
to
possess
a
worldly
wisdom
surpassing
that
of
good
christians
but
the
bible
truly
says
the
children
of
this
world
are
in
their
generation
wiser
than
the
children
of
light
on
all
secular
matters
indeed
aristotle
is
a
final
authority
thus
says
aristotle
is
the
best
way
to
silence
every
hostile
argument
only
very
rarely
can
a
man
hope
by
his
own
cogitations
to
overthrow
the
dicta
of
this
wonderful
sage
of
athens
a
great
deal
of
the
monkish
student
time
is
taken
up
with
abstract
problems
of
philology
and
logic
nevertheless
the
abbey
contains
many
parchments
widening
to
one
knowledge
of
the
world
for
example
you
can
read
in
vincent
de
beauvais
of
a
minute
account
of
the
universe
and
all
things
within
it
you
can
learn
the
astonishing
fact
that
the
world
is
a
kind
of
globe
suspended
at
the
center
of
the
cosmos
many
other
wonderful
things
are
described
as
for
example
lead
can
be
transmuted
into
gold
and
all
kinds
of
wonders
which
defy
ordinary
experience
but
which
are
not
to
be
doubted
since
god
can
of
course
do
anything
or
one
can
turn
to
hugues
de
treatise
beasts
and
other
and
learn
all
about
the
habits
of
animals
concerning
how
stags
can
live
nine
hundred
years
and
how
the
dove
with
her
right
eye
contemplates
herself
and
with
her
left
eye
god
there
are
books
also
on
medicine
parts
of
which
contain
sober
wisdom
worthy
of
attention
by
the
murderous
physicians
but
elsewhere
giving
such
directions
as
that
since
autumn
is
the
melancholy
season
people
should
then
eat
more
heartily
than
in
summer
and
should
refrain
from
love
affairs
as
for
the
more
abstract
sciences
in
music
the
monks
know
the
four
principal
and
the
four
secondary
sounds
the
of
the
scales
the
seven
modulations
and
the
five
strings
of
the
viol
in
geometry
they
can
with
the
aid
of
a
stick
lying
on
the
ground
find
the
height
of
walls
and
towers
in
arithmetic
they
can
multiply
and
divide
with
great
facility
and
keep
accounts
like
a
king
treasurer
in
astronomy
they
understand
the
motion
of
the
planets
and
their
qualities
saturn
which
is
proud
wise
and
ambitious
and
mars
malevolent
and
bad
provoking
strife
and
battles
and
how
the
sun
is
hung
in
the
midst
of
the
planets
three
above
and
three
below
and
much
more
similar
wisdom
although
one
must
proceed
carefully
in
astronomy
for
its
connection
with
astrology
is
close
and
from
astrology
to
the
black
art
is
not
a
long
journey
sidenote
scientific
studies
and
chronicle
writing
the
good
monks
have
perhaps
made
their
best
progress
in
botany
and
geology
some
of
the
brethren
have
gathered
collections
of
curious
minerals
of
herbs
and
also
of
dried
bird
and
animal
skins
although
the
interest
seems
to
be
in
the
healing
qualities
of
various
substances
rather
than
in
the
nature
of
the
things
themselves
thus
it
is
certain
that
figs
are
good
for
wounds
and
broken
bones
aloes
stops
hair
from
falling
the
root
of
mandrake
will
make
women
love
you
and
plenty
of
sage
in
a
garden
somehow
protects
the
owner
from
premature
death
as
for
geology
that
consists
of
the
collecting
and
arranging
of
curious
stones
it
is
of
course
settled
in
genesis
that
the
world
was
made
in
a
very
few
days
the
infidel
avincenna
has
indeed
advanced
the
theory
that
mountains
are
caused
by
the
upheaval
of
the
earth
crust
and
by
action
of
water
one
must
hesitate
however
about
believing
this
it
seems
hardly
compatible
with
holy
writ
on
the
other
hand
the
books
on
animals
unhesitatingly
tell
about
remarkable
creatures
which
are
mentioned
in
aristotle
or
in
pliny
or
by
the
arabs
unicorns
phoenixes
and
dragons
are
well
understood
likewise
sea
monsters
as
for
example
great
krakens
which
drag
down
ships
with
their
tentacles
sirens
or
mermaids
and
finally
sea
bishops
probably
a
kind
of
seal
which
piously
bless
their
human
victims
before
devouring
them
besides
the
study
of
these
older
books
the
monks
are
writing
certain
books
themselves
the
most
important
is
the
great
chronicle
begun
some
years
ago
by
the
learned
brother
emeri
it
commences
with
the
creation
of
the
world
and
adam
and
eve
tells
about
the
greeks
and
romans
and
charlemagne
and
his
heirs
and
then
in
much
greater
detail
gives
the
recent
history
of
the
duchy
of
quelqueparte
the
happenings
at
the
abbey
and
also
much
about
the
barons
of
aliquis
emeri
is
now
dead
but
the
chronicle
is
continued
from
year
to
year
it
is
really
a
compendium
of
varied
learning
from
it
for
example
you
learn
all
about
the
wars
of
julius
cæsar
the
crusades
the
great
lawsuit
of
ten
years
ago
over
some
of
the
abbey
lands
the
feud
between
conon
and
foretvert
and
how
in
a
calf
was
born
on
a
neighboring
barony
and
in
a
meteor
struck
near
pontdebois
the
latin
in
this
chronicle
is
on
the
whole
very
good
sometimes
almost
equal
to
livy
and
the
story
is
embellished
by
constant
citations
not
merely
of
virgil
and
horace
but
of
homer
and
plato
one
would
suppose
from
this
that
the
authors
were
familiar
with
greek
such
however
is
by
no
means
the
case
all
the
quotations
from
greek
authors
and
many
of
their
latin
ones
are
taken
from
commonplace
books
nevertheless
the
narrative
seems
the
more
elegant
for
this
borrowed
learning
the
monks
are
proud
of
their
chronicle
and
never
fail
to
boast
how
much
more
complete
accurate
and
erudite
it
is
than
similar
works
compiled
at
the
rival
institutions
when
the
monks
are
not
actually
studying
they
are
often
copying
aliquis
has
more
than
two
hundred
volumes
in
its
library
parchment
is
very
expensive
but
very
durable
when
the
abbot
sees
his
way
to
procure
material
for
another
volume
he
is
likely
to
send
to
some
friendly
convent
to
borrow
a
book
which
his
monks
do
not
yet
possess
then
some
of
the
most
skillful
brethren
are
put
to
work
making
a
copy
if
possible
more
beautiful
than
the
original
in
from
six
months
to
a
year
the
work
will
probably
be
finished
although
if
a
duplicate
is
to
be
made
of
a
work
already
on
hand
there
will
be
less
haste
and
the
process
may
extend
over
years
copying
is
an
excellent
means
of
propitiating
heaven
bernard
said
emphatically
every
word
which
you
write
is
a
blow
which
smites
the
devil
and
cassiodorus
much
earlier
asserted
by
the
exercise
of
the
mind
upon
the
holy
scriptures
you
convey
to
those
who
read
a
kind
of
moral
instruction
you
preach
with
the
hand
converting
the
hand
into
an
organ
of
speech
thus
as
it
were
fighting
the
with
pen
and
ink
parchment
we
have
said
is
a
costly
article
to
provide
a
single
book
scores
of
sheep
must
die
a
new
style
of
writing
material
however
is
just
coming
into
vogue
paper
a
substance
made
of
linen
cloth
now
is
being
produced
in
small
quantities
in
france
although
as
usual
it
seems
to
have
been
an
invention
of
the
arab
infidels
some
day
perhaps
paper
will
become
so
plentiful
and
cheap
that
books
can
be
multiplied
in
vast
numbers
but
as
yet
practically
everything
has
to
be
on
parchment
which
is
certainly
far
less
destructible
than
paper
whatever
the
cost
sidenote
elegant
manuscripts
and
binding
in
the
cloister
alcoves
a
dozen
copyists
are
pursuing
their
task
with
infinite
patience
their
question
is
not
how
fast
but
how
well
for
they
are
performing
a
work
unto
god
as
a
rule
they
write
their
sheets
in
two
columns
making
their
characters
either
in
roundish
minuscule
or
in
squarer
gothic
the
initials
are
in
bright
colors
some
with
a
background
of
gold
here
and
there
may
be
painted
in
a
brilliant
miniature
illustration
the
work
of
the
best
copyists
is
beautifully
legible
the
scribes
put
their
heart
and
soul
into
their
productions
they
expect
the
volumes
will
be
memorials
to
their
faithfulness
and
piety
scores
of
years
after
they
are
departed
when
the
sheets
are
completed
the
book
is
bound
in
leather
much
the
same
as
in
other
ages
although
sometimes
the
sides
are
of
wood
in
any
case
there
are
likely
to
be
metal
clasps
and
bosses
of
brass
upon
the
covers
a
few
of
the
most
precious
volumes
are
adorned
with
plates
of
silver
or
carved
ivory
so
year
by
year
the
library
grows
it
need
not
be
remarked
that
every
copy
is
and
with
devoted
thoroughness
what
the
learning
of
the
feudal
age
therefore
lacks
in
breadth
is
somewhat
compensated
for
by
intensity
the
older
and
more
studious
monks
know
almost
by
heart
the
facts
in
their
entire
collection
the
younger
brethren
revere
them
as
carrying
in
their
own
heads
practically
everything
significant
in
the
way
of
worldly
wisdom
thus
we
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
superficial
and
material
side
of
a
typical
monastic
establishment
into
its
spiritual
and
intellectual
atmosphere
we
can
not
find
time
to
penetrate
our
present
duty
is
to
return
to
the
world
and
to
examine
the
but
as
yet
unvisited

of
pontdebois
footnotes
abbots
and
their
advocates
were
continually
having
friction
over
their
respective
prerogatives
if
victor
and
conon
got
along
in
fair
harmony
they
were
somewhat
exceptional
both
as
prelate
and
as
seigneur
see
also
a
great
abbey
like
cluny
would
have
so
many
lay
servitors
that
it
could
dispense
with
manual
labor
by
the
monks
save
where
personal
aptitude
was
lacking
for
anything
else
the
result
was
that
french
was
able
to
develop
as
a
very
forceful
expressive
language
unspoiled
by
pedantry
before
many
serious
books
were
written
in
the
vernacular
the
same
was
somewhat
true
also
of
english
german
and
other
modern
tongues
this
would
be
especially
true
of
copies
of
the
bible
of
which
every
abbey
would
have
at
least
one
example
and
additional
specimens
would
be
prepared
very
deliberately
with
the
intention
of
making
the
new
work
just
as
beautiful
and
permanent
as
possible
the
introduction
of
paper
was
of
course
absolutely
necessary
if
the
invention
of
printing
were
to
have
any
real
value
it
is
perhaps
proper
to
say
that
dante
a
person
of
course
of
remarkable
intellect
was
able
to
master
the
of
learned
information
and
science
available
in
his

this
was
not
true
of
the
next
great
mediæval
scholar

his
period
the
supply
of

knowledge
had
become

that
are
urgently
needed
but
as
a
rule
the
baron
family
saves
up
all
its
important
purchases
until
the
fair
when
many
desirable
things
not
ordinarily
to
be
had
in
the
city
are
put
on
sale
this
present
season
the
fair
seems
the
more
important
because
on
account
of
the
expensive
fêtes
conon
can
not
afford
to
visit
paris
and
must
make
his
purchases
nearer
home
it
is
only
a
few
leagues
to
pontdebois
but
messire
travels
with
a
considerable
retinue
at
least
twenty
men
at
arms
well
equipped
besides
body
servants
for
himself
and
his
wife
and
a
long
string
of
sumpter
beasts
to
bring
back
the
desired
commodities
for
the
castle
must
really
stock
itself
for
the
year
the
baron
hardly
fears
an
attack
by
robbers
so
near
to
his
own
castle
and
to
a
friendly
town
but
he
takes
no
chances
the
best
of
seigneurs
disclaim
any
responsibility
for
the
fate
of
travelers
who
proceed
by
night
and
one
sire
who
controls
some
miles
of
the
way
has
possibly
a
quiet
understanding
with
certain
outlaws
that
they
may
lurk
in
his
forests
and
watch
the
roads
without
too
much
questioning
provided
they
refrain
from
outrages
upon
important
people
and
make
him
liberal
presents
at
christmas
and
easter
in
any
case
a
number
of
merchants
packmen
and
other
humble
travelers
who
had
gone
safely
as
far
as
aliquis
are
glad
to
complete
the
journey
in
the
baron
formidable
company
conon
in
turn
gladly
protects
them
it
adds
to
his
prestige
to
approach
pontdebois
with
a
great
following
the
roads
are
no
worse
than
elsewhere
yet
they
are
abominable
trails
and
muddy
ruts
they
seem
most
of
the
year
ordinarily
passable
only
for
horses
and
mules
although
in
the
summer
rude
carts
can
bump
along
them
to
cross
the
streams
you
must
in
some
places
depend
on
fords
very
dangerous
in
the
springtime
one
unfordable
river
entering
the
claire
is
indeed
crossed
by
a
rude
wooden
bridge
the
building
of
bridges
is
fostered
by
the
church
a
great
indulgence
was
proclaimed
by
the
bishop
some
years
ago
when
this
bridge
was
constructed
as
a
pious
work
especially
useful
for
pilgrims
unfortunately
no
one
is
responsible
for
its
upkeep
it
is
falling
into
disrepair
and
already
is
so
tottering
that
as
men
pass
over
it
they
repeat
those
formulas
commending
their
souls
to
god
which
the
church
provides
for
use
whenever
one
is
attempting
unstable
bridges
sidenote
travelers
and
inns
on
the
journey
you
meet
many
humble
travelers
obliged
to
trudge
weary
miles
there
is
a
poor
peasant
seeking
a
farm
now
on
a
distant
seigneury
he
has
a
donkey
to
carry
some
of
his
household
gear
and
one
of
the
children
his
wife
is
painfully
carrying
the
youngest
infant
the
poor
man
himself
staggers
under
a
great
sack
travelers
of
more
consequence
ride
horseback
with
a
large
mail
or
leathern
portmanteau
tied
on
their
beast
crupper
their
burdens
are
heavy
because
one
often
has
to
spend
the
night
in
abominable
quarters
and
consequently
must
if
possible
carry
flint
steel
and
tinder
for
making
a
fire
some
kind
of
bedding
and
very
often
a
tent
along
the
road
too
are
any
quantity
of
beggars
real
or
pretended
cripples
and
other
deformed
persons
wandering
about
and
living
on
charity
or
blind
men
with
staffs
and
dogs
the
beggars
disguise
is
a
favorite
one
for
robbers
the
wretches
too
who
whine
their
alms
messire
alms
and
hold
up
a
wrist
minus
the
hand
or
point
to
where
an
eye
has
been
gouged
out
probably
have
suffered
just
punishments
for
crimes
although
some
of
them
may
have
mutilated
themselves
merely
in
order
to
work
on
the
sympathies
of
the
gullible
as
the
party
approaches
pontdebois
the
houses
become
better
and
closer
together
and
just
outside
the
gate
is
a
group
of
taverns
available
for
those
who
prefer
to
carouse
or
lodge
without
rather
than
within
the
city
walls
conon
is
on
terms
of
hospitality
with
a
rich
burgher
who
has
found
the
baron
favor
profitable
and
he
leads
his
company
promptly
inside
the
gates
but
many
of
the
humbler
travelers
turn
off
to
these
taverns
adela
gives
an
aristocratic
sniff
of
disdain
as
they
ride
past
such
places
they
are
assuredly
very
dirty
and
from
them
proceeds
the
smell
of
stale
wine
and
poor
cooking
the
owners
smooth
smirking
men
stand
by
the
road
as
travelers
come
in
sight
and
begin
to
praise
their
hostelries
within
one
of
them
is
calling
out
are
all
manner
of
comforts
painted
chambers
and
soft
beds
packed
high
with
white
straw
under
soft
feather
mattresses
here
is
your
hostel
for
love
affairs
when
you
retire
you
will
fall
asleep
on
pillows
of
violets
after
you
have
washed
out
your
mouth
and
rinsed
your
hands
with
rose
water
his
victims
however
will
find
themselves
in
a
dirty
public
dining
room
where
men
and
women
alike
are
drinking
and
dicing
around
the
bare
oaken
tables
at
night
the
guests
will
sleep
in
the
few
chambers
bed
wedged
by
bed
or
perhaps
two
in
a
bed
upon
feathers
anything
but
in
the
rear
of
most
inns
too
there
is
a
garden
where
guests
are
urged
to
carouse
with
the
unsavory
females
who
haunt
the
establishments
the
visitors
will
be
lucky
if
they
can
get
safely
away
without
being
made
stupidly
drunken
and
then
robbed
or
having
the
innkeeper
seize
their
baggage
or
even
their
clothes
on
the
pretense
that
they
have
not
paid
their
reckoning
leaving
these
taverns
at
one
side
the
aliquis
company
rides
straight
onward
before
it
the
spires
and
walls
of
pontdebois
are
rising
the
circuit
of
gray
curtain
walls
and
turrets
reaches
down
to
the
claire
on
which
barges
are
swinging
and
across
which
stretches
the
solid
wooden
bridge
which
gives
the
good
town
its
name
above
the
walls
you
can
see
the
gabled
roofs
of
the
more
pretentious
houses
the
great
round
donjon
the
civic
watchtower
and
above
all
else
the
soaring
fabric
and
stately
mass
of
the
cathedral
with
the
scaffolding
still
around
its
unfinished
towers
several
smaller
parish
churches
are
also
visible
the
baron
company
is
obliged
to
halt
at
the
gate
such
is
the
influx
and
efflux
of
rickety
carts
sumpter
beasts
and
persons
thrusting
across
the
drawbridge
way
good
people
conon
squires
cry
way
for
messire
of
st
aliquis
and
at
last
not
without
a
cracking
of
whips
to
make
these
mechanic
crowds
know
their
betters
the
party
forces
a
path
down
the
narrow
streets
sidenote
entering
a
city
a
visit
to
pontdebois
is
no
real
novelty
to
the
castle
folk
yet
they
always
experience
a
sense
of
bustle
and
vastness
upon
entering
here
are
eight
thousand
indeed
some
assert
ten
thousand
people
all
living
together
in
a
single
community
how
confused
even
the
saints
must
be
when
they
peer
from
heaven
and
try
to
number
this
swarm
of
young
and
old
rich
and
poor
masters
and
apprentices
packed
in
behind
one
set
of
walls
to
tell
the
truth
the
circuit
of
pontdebois
is
not
very
great
to
render
the
walls
as
defensible
as
possible
and
to
save
expense
the
fortifications
have
been
made
to
inclose
the
smallest
circumference
that
will
answer
as
a
result
the
land
inside
is
precious
houses
are
wedged
closely
together
streets
are
extraordinarily
narrow
people
can
hardly
stir
without
colliding
with
others
and
about
the
only
real
breathing
spaces
are
the
market
place
and
some
open
ground
around
the
cathedral
behind
the
bishop
palace
also
there
is
a
small
garden
otherwise
it
appears
almost
as
if
not
one
green
thing
could
grow
in
pontdebois
the
contrast
with
the
open
country
whence
the
travelers
have
just
come
is
therefore
startling
even
the
best
of
the
streets
are
dark
tortuous
and
filthy
there
is
almost
no
paving
the
waste
water
of
the
houses
is
flung
from
the
windows
horrid
offal
is
thus
cast
out
as
well
as
the
blood
and
refuse
from
the
numerous
slaughterhouses
pigs
are
privileged
as
scavengers
even
in
the
market
place
the
streets
are
the
darker
because
the
second
stories
of
the
houses
project
considerably
over
the
first
the
third
over
the
second
and
also
the
fourth
and
fifth
which
often
exist
over
those
lower
consequently
there
is
almost
a
roof
formed
over
the
lanes
cutting
off
rain
light
and
air
in
the
upper
stories
neighbors
not
merely
can
gossip
but
can
actually
shake
hands
with
their
friends
across
the
street
all
the
thoroughfares
too
are
amazingly
crooked
as
if
everybody
had
once
built
his
house
where
it
pleased
him
and
afterward
some
kind
of
a
bypath
around
it
had
been
created
at
night
these
twisting
avenues
are
dark
as
pitch
no
one
can
get
about
without
a
lantern
and
even
with
one
it
were
better
if
possible
to
stay
at
home
to
prevent
the
easy
flight
of
thieves
it
is
common
to
stretch
many
heavy
chains
across
the
streets
at
night
notwithstanding
footpads
often
lurk
in
the
covert
of
black
corners
pontdebois
has
few
quiet
residence
sections
it
is
a
community
of
almost
nothing
but
little
shops
and
little
industries
the
two
being
often
combined
under
one
roof
the
shops
generally
open
directly
into
the
streets
with
their
stalls
intruding
on
the
public
way
like
oriental
bazaars
the
streets
in
fact
seem
to
be
almost
the
property
of
the
merchants
foot
passengers
can
barely
find
a
passage
carts
can
not
traverse
the
town
during
business
hours
and
conon
company
on
horseback
might
have
found
itself
absolutely
blocked
had
it
not
chanced
to
arrive
almost
precisely
at
noon
when
the
hum
and
bustle
very
suddenly
cease
and
the
worthy
folk
of
pontdebois
forsake
their
counters
and
benches
to
enjoy
hearty
dinners
sidenote
a
rich
burgher
house
as
it
is
they
reach
the
market
place
just
as
the
city
hangman
has
finished
a
necessary
ceremony
one
lambert
a
master
woolen
weaver
had
been
caught
selling
adulterated
and
dishonestly
woven
cloth
contrary
to
the
statutes
of
his
guild
the
hangman
has
solemnly
burned
the
offending
bolts
of
cloth
before
a
jeering
crowd
of
apprentices
while
lambert
offense
has
been
cried
out
with
loud
voice
the
man
is
disgraced
and
ruined
he
will
have
to
become
again
a
mere
wage
earner
or
quit
the
city
outright
his
misfortune
is
the
choice
news
of
the
hour
the
smell
of
the
burning
cloth
is
still
in
the
air
when
party
rides
by
the
pillory
and
halts
at
the
house
of
the
rich
othon
bouchaut
who
is
ready
to
receive
them
maître
othon
is
one
of
the
principal
burghers
he
has
grown
rich
by
importing
wares
from
venice
constantinople
and
the
lands
of
the
infidels
it
is
scandalous
say
some
nobles
how
he
villein
born
with
hands
only
accustomed
to
hold
a
purse
or
a
pen
is
able
to
talk
to
a
great
seigneur
without
groveling
as
every
good
peasant
ought
he
and
his
wife
even
wear
gold
lace
pearls
and
costly
stuffs
on
fête
days
as
if
they
were
nobles
and
they
are
said
actually
to
have
broken
the
law
forbidding
to
wear
furs
very
deplorable
but
what
can
be
done
othon
is
so
rich
that
he
can
stir
up
trouble
even
for
the
duke
nothing
remains
but
to
speak
him
fair
and
accept
his
hospitality
this
powerful
merchant
house
is
in
the
marketplace
it
rises
five
stories
high
and
is
built
of
beams
filled
in
with
laths
mortar
and
stucco
on
the
ground
floor
are
storerooms
for
costly
oriental
goods
and
desks
where
the
master
clerks
seem
forever
busy
with
complicated
accounts
on
the
next
are
the
rooms
for
the
family
and
although
without
the
spacious
magnificence
of
the
great
hall
at
aliquis
adela
remarks
a
little
enviously
that
her
host
wife
enjoys
many
comforts
and
luxuries
hardly
known
in
the
castle
the
upper
stories
are
full
of
small
chambers
for
othon
family
his
clerks
and
the
younger
apprentices
who
are
learning
his
business
before
the
front
door
swings
the
ensign
of
the
house
a
gilded
mortar
in
token
of
the
powdered
spices
which
the
owner
sells
the
houses
of
pontdebois
have
no
numbers
the
ensigns
serve
to
identify
them
one
of
othon
neighbors
lives
at
the
crouching
cat
another
at
the
tin
pot
another
at
the
silver
fish
and
so
on
all
through
the
town
the
house
of
othon
also
appears
to
be
quite
new
as
do
many
others
this
however
is
a
doubtful
sign
of
good
fortune
only
a
few
years
ago
much
of
pontdebois
was
burned
down
the
narrow
streets
the
thatched
roofs
the
absence
of
any
means
of
checking
a
blaze
save
a
line
of
buckets
hastily
organized
make
great
fires
a
standing
menace
to
every
city
othon
complains
that
at
any
moment
he
may
be
reduced
almost
to
beggary
by
the
carelessness
of
some
wretched
scullery
maid
or
tavern
apprentice
he
will
also
say
that
somehow
in
the
city
there
is
greater
danger
of
the
plague
than
in
the
country
castles
or
even
in
the
villages
with
their
dungheaps
a
dozen
years
ago
pontdebois
lost
a
quarter
of
its
population
by
an
outbreak
which
spared
neither
rich
nor
poor
before
which
physicians
and
religious
processions
seemed
alike
helpless
and
which
demoralized
the
community
before
the
saints
mercifully
halted
the
devastation
sidenote
the
communal
donjon
there
are
only
a
few
stone
houses
in
pontdebois
even
the
best
houses
of
the
citizens
are
usually
of
wood
and
mortar
not
yet
have
risen
those
magnificent
stone
city
halls
which
later
will
be
the
glory
of
north
france
and
flanders
but
on
one
side
of
the
market
place
rises
the
communal
donjon
the
good
town
is
like
a
seigneur
indeed
somewhat
it
a
seigneur
placed
in
commission
it
has
its
walls
and
therefore
its
strong
citadel
the
donjon
forms
a
high
solid
square
tower
dominating
the
public
square
at
its
summit
there
is
always
a
watchman
ready
at
first
danger
of
fire
or
attack
to
boom
the
alarm
bell
the
tower
itself
is
large
enough
to
have
rooms
in
its
base
nearest
the
ground
is
the
council
chamber
where
the
worshipful
echevins
can
deliberate
above
that
is
the
archive
room
where
the
elaborate
town
records
are
kept
directly
under
the
council
chamber
however
is
the
prison
where
general
offenders
are
mewed
up
no
more
comfortably
than
in
the
abysses
of
aliquis
the
soul
of
the
communal
donjon
however
hovers
around
its
bells
there
in
the
dark
tower
hang
shrill
jacqueline
loud
carolus
and
deepest
and
mightiest
of
all
holy
trinity
and
several
others
a
peal
of
powerful
bells
pertains
to
every
free
town
of
course
they
ring
lustily
and
merrily
on
holidays
indeed
strangers
to
the
city
think
they
are
rung
too
often
for
repose
but
if
they
all
begin
leaping
and
thundering
together
that
is
probably
a
sign
for
a
mass
meeting
of
the
citizens
in
the
open
plaza
before
the
donjon
the
magistrates
may
wish
to
harangue
the
populace
from
the
balcony
just
above
the
council
room
descanting
upon
some
public
danger
or
deliver
a
peaceful
explanation
of
some
new
municipal
ordinance
in
any
case
a
commune
without
its
donjon
and
bells
is
like
a
ship
without
its
rudder
and
if
ever
pontdebois
succumbs
to
superior
power
the
first
step
of
the
conqueror
will
probably
be
to
take
away
the
bells
that
will
be
the
same
thing
as
annulling
the
city
liberties
pontdebois
has
been
a
good
town
with
a
charter
of
privileges
for
about
a
hundred
years
as
early
as
charlemagne
day
a
village
existed
upon
the
site
the
location
proved
good
for
trade
but
the
inhabitants
despite
success
in
commerce
and
industry
and
increasing
numbers
were
for
a
long
time
mere
villeins
dependent
upon
the
lord
bishop
of
the
town
and
region
and
with
no
more
rights
than
the
peasants
of
the
fields
had
however
in
dealing
with
men
who
were
steadily
becoming
richer
and
who
were
picking
up
strange
ideas
by
foreign
intercourse
it
proved
much
harder
to
keep
them
content
with
their
station
than
it
did
the
run
of
villeins
besides
the
dukes
of
quelqueparte
although
very
loath
to
grant
privileges
to
their
own
villeins
were
not
averse
to
having
privileges
given
to
the
subjects
of
such
independent
and
unreliable
vassals
as
the
bishops
of
pontdebois
consequently
when
the
townspeople
about
began
raising
the
cry
commune
commune
in
the
episcopal
presence
the
bishop
could
not
look
to
his
suzerain
for
much
support
indeed
it
was
being
realized
by
intelligent
seigneurs
that
granting
a
charter
to
a
town
often
meant
a
great
increase
of
wealth
so
that
if
the
lord
fiscal
rights
were
carefully
safeguarded
he
was
actually
the
gainer
by
an
apparent
cession
of
part
of
his
authority
the
upshot
was
that
about
when
a
certain
bishop
needed
a
large
purse
to
cover
his
travel
to
the
holy
land
for
a
round
sum
the
townsfolk
bought
from
him
a
charter
a
precious
document
which
practically
raised
them
out
of
the
status
of
villeins
and
protected
them
against
those
executions
and
tyrannies
which
the
run
of
peasants
had
to
accept
resignedly
as
they
did
bad
winters
sidenote
charter
of
a
commune
this
charter
read
in
part
much
as
follows
i
henri
by
the
grace
of
god
bishop
of
pontdebois
make
known
to
all
present
and
to
come
that
i
have
established
the
undermentioned
rules
for
the
inhabitants
of
my
town
of
pontdebois
every
male
inhabitant
of
said
town
shall
pay
me
every
year
twelve
deniers
and
a
bushel
of
oats
as
the
price
of
his
dwelling
and
if
he
desires
to
hold
land
outside
the
walls
four
deniers
per
year
for
each
acre
the
houses
vines
and
fields
may
be
sold
and
alienated
at
the
pleasure
of
the
holder
the
dwellers
in
this
town
shall
go
neither
to
the
feudal
levy
nor
on
any
other
expedition
unless
i
lead
the
same
in
person
they
are
allowed
six
echevins
to
administer
the
ordinary
business
of
the
town
and
to
assist
my
provost
in
his
duties
i
especially
decree
that
no
seigneur
shall
withdraw
from
this
town
any
inhabitants
for
any
reason
unless
they
are
actually
men
or
owe
him
arrears
in
taxes
etc
after
securing
this
charter
the
men
of
pontdebois
began
to
hold
up
their
heads
in
a
manner
grievous
to
the
neighboring
nobles
and
even
more
grievous
to
the
wealthy
clergy
for
were
often
the
original
suzerains
of
the
towns
and
their
authority
was
the
most
seriously
curtailed
the
books
are
full
of
the
wrath
of
the
ecclesiastics
over
the
changed
situation
a
name
new
and
detestable
pungently
wrote
abbot
guibert
of
nogent
even
when
the
movement
was
young
while
bishop
ives
of
chartres
assured
everybody
that
compacts
with
city
folk
are
binding
on
no
one
they
are
contrary
to
the
canon
law
and
the
decision
of
the
holy
fathers
even
as
recently
as
a
synod
at
paris
has
denounced
communes
as
the
creations
of
usurers
and
exactors
who
have
set
up
diabolical
usages
tending
to
overthrow
the
jurisdiction
of
the
church
however
righteous
the
anger
of
these
holy
men
it
has
proved
vain
the
communes
ever
wax
stronger
and
annually
some
new
seigneur
is
compelled
to
sell
a
charter
or
even
to
grant
one
for
nothing
the
kings
watch
complacently
a
movement
which
weakens
their
unruly
feudatories
sometimes
the
townsfolk
have
grown
insolent
and
tried
to
defend
their
privileges
by
sheer
violence
once
there
was
a
very
tyrannous
bishop
of
laon
he
foolishly
tried
to
cancel
a
charter
granted
the
city
and
boasted
what
can
you
expect
these
people
to
do
by
their
commotions
if
my
negro
boy
john
were
to
seize
the
most
terrible
of
them
by
the
nose
the
fellow
would
not
even
growl
what
they
yesterday
called
a
i
have
forced
them
to
give
up
at
least
as
long
as
i
live
the
next
day
the
yell
commune
commune
rang
in
the
streets
a
mob
sacked
the
episcopal
palace
and
found
the
bishop
hiding
in
a
cask
at
the
bottom
of
the
cellar
the
howling
populace
dragged
him
into
the
street
and
killed
him
with
a
hatchet
then
to
add
to
this
sacrilege
upon
an
anointed
bishop
they
plundered
most
of
the
nobles
who
chanced
to
be
in
the
town
after
such
deeds
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
king
went
to
laon
and
order
with
a
strong
hand
nevertheless
some
years
later
a
new
charter
was
granted
the
town
and
the
succeeding
bishops
have
had
to
walk
warily
despite
inward
groanings
sidenote
rule
by
echevins
and
rich
merchants
fortunately
pontdebois
has
been
spared
these
convulsions
as
a
rule
the
local
prelates
have
been
reasonable
and
conciliatory
the
bishop
is
still
called
suzerain
he
receives
the
fixed
tax
provided
in
the
original
agreement
he
has
jurisdiction
over
the
citizens
in
spiritual
matters
which
include
heresy
blasphemy
insults
and
assaults
upon
priests
and
outrages
to
churches
likewise
much
of
what
might
be
called
probate
litigation
touching
the
validity
of
marriages
and
children
and
consequently
the
wills
and
property
rights
affected
thereby
however
in
most
secular
particulars
the
citizens
have
pretty
complete
control
they
levy
numerous
imposts
direct
taxes
tolls
and
market
dues
they
enroll
a
militia
to
defend
the
walls
and
to
take
the
field
under
their
own
officers
and
banner
when
the
general
levy
of
the
region
is
called
out
they
pass
many
local
ordinances
and
they
name
their
own
magistrates
who
administer
high
justice
they
can
even
wage
local
wars
if
they
have
a
grievance
against
neighboring
barons
being
themselves
a
kind
of
collective
seigneur
the
one
thing
they
do
is
to
coin
money
that
is
a
privilege
carefully
reserved
to
the
king
and
to
the
superior
nobility
practically
all
these
powers
are
exercised
by
the
six
echevins
with
a
higher
dignitary
the
mayor
at
their
head
there
is
little
real
democracy
however
in
pontdebois
the
richer
merchants
like
othon
and
the
more
prosperous
masters
form
practically
an
oligarchy
excluding
the
poor
artisans
and
apprentices
from
any
share
in
municipal
affairs
save
that
of
paying
taxes
and
listening
to
edicts
by
the
magistrates
the
same
officers
are
year
after
year
they
use
the
town
money
much
as
they
see
fit
refusing
public
reckoning
and
blandly
announcing
that
they
render
their
accounts
to
one
another
there
are
therefore
certain
discontented
fellows
who
even
murmur
we
burghers
are
worse
taxed
and
oppressed
than
are
baron
conon
villeins
at
st
aliquis
nevertheless
there
is
often
a
great
desire
to
become
even
a
passive
citizen
of
pontdebois
if
you
can
live
there
unmolested
for
a
year
and
a
day
you
escape
the
jurisdiction
of
the
lord
on
whose
estate
you
have
been
a
villein
you
are
protected
against
those
outrages
which
are
possible
on
even
the
best
seigneuries
most
of
all
you
gain
a
chance
to
become
something
more
than
a
clodhopping
plowman
perhaps
your
grandchildren
at
least
will
become
wealthy
and
powerful
enough
to
receive
a
baron
as
their
guest
even
as
does
the
rich
othon
so
one
may
wander
about
the
twisting
streets
of
pontdebois
until
nightfall
when
the
loud
horns
blow
curfew
cover
fires
after
that
the
streets
are
deserted
save
for
the
occasional
watchman
rattling
his
staff
and
calling
through
the
darkness
pray
for
the
dead
footnotes
another
abuse
would
be
to
levy
a
heavy
toll
on
all
travelers
passing
a
castle
irrespective
of
whether
there
was
any
legal
license
to
demand
the
same
if
pontdebois
really
had
as
many
as
eight
thousand
permanent
inhabitants
it
was
no
mean
community
in
feudal
times
many
a
city
would
have
only
two
or
three
thousand
or
even
less
a
place
of
ten
thousand
or
more
would
rank
as
the
most
important
center
for
a
wide
region
there
were
few
of
such
size
in
france
even
in
paris
at
this
time
the
only
paving
was
on
the
streets
leading
directly
to
the
city
gates
the
remainder
continued
to
be
a
mere
slough
a
choice
breeding
place
for
those
contagious
diseases
against
which
precautions
were
assumed
to
be
useless
and
to
which
men
were
bound
to
submit
as
to
the
will
of
god
supplications
to
some
healing
saint
like
firman
or
antoine
usually
seemed
more
efficacious
than
any
real
sanitary
precautions
rouen
had
six
severe
fires
between
and
and
yet
was
not
exceptionally
unfortunate
if
a
city
were
close
to
a
river
it
was
liable
also
to
very
serious
freshets
of
course
every
place
was
in
fairly
constant
danger
of
being
stormed
sacked
and
burned
down
in
war
modern
travelers
are
to
this
day
impressed
by
the
amount
of
bellringing
which
goes
on
in
such
unspoiled
flemish
towns
as
bruges
of
course
no
two
communal
charters
were
ever
alike
although
many
were
run
in
a
common
mold
many
towns
received
not
a
full
charter
but
rights
of
burgessy
guaranties
against
various
common
forms
of
oppression
although
the
laws
were
still
actually
administered
by
officers
named
by
the
seigneur
bishops
often
had
their
cathedral
and
episcopal
seat
at
the
largest
place
in
their
dioceses
the
very
places
most
likely
to
demand
charters
the
echevins
were
often
known
instead
as
jurés
and
their
numbers
were
frequently
much
greater
than
six
the
mayors
might
be
called
provosts

rewards

industry
and
trade
in
pontdebois
the
great
fair
the
aliquis
folk
have
come
to
pontdebois
largely
to
attend
the
great
fair
soon
to
open
but
the
more
ordinary
articles
they
will
purchase
can
be
found
on
sale
on
any
week
day
the
city
is
a
beehive
of
industry
notwithstanding
much
talk
about
commerce
in
the
feudal
ages
the
means
of
communication
and
transport
are
so
bad
that
it
is
only
the
luxuries
not
the
essentials
that
can
be
exported
very
far
it
takes
thirty
days
in
good
weather
to
travel
from
paris
to
marseilles
it
takes
sometimes
a
week
to
go
from
pontdebois
to
paris
and
there
is
no
larger
industrial
city
much
nearer
than
paris
the
result
is
that
almost
everything
ordinarily
needed
in
a
château
village
or
even
in
a
monastery
which
can
not
be
made
upon
the
spot
is
manufactured
and
sold
in
this
good
town
industrial
life
however
seems
to
exist
on
a
very
small
scale
there
are
no
real
factories
an
establishment
employing
more
than
four
or
five
persons
including
the
proprietor
is
rare
much
commoner
are
petty
workshops
conducted
by
the
owner
alone
or
aided
by
only
one
youthful
apprentice
this
multiplicity
of
extremely
small
plants
gives
pontdebois
a
show
of
bustle
and
activity
which
its
actual
population
does
not
warrant
when
you
do
business
in
a
town
simply
name
your
desires
and
you
can
be
directed
to
a
little
winding
street
containing
all
the
shops
of
a
given
industry
there
is
the
glass
workers
street
the
tanners

the

the

directly
upon

moment

of

begin
a
terrific
uproar

trying

down

and
almost
dragging

then
conclude
a
bargain
unmolested
by
outsiders
in
the

markets
the
scenes
can
be
even
more
riotous
while
the
phrases
used
by
the
hucksters
in
crying
their
wares
are
peculiar
and
picturesque
as
always
in
trade
it
is
well
that
the
buyer
should
beware
fixed
prices
are
really
unknown
and
inferior
goods
are
inordinately
praised
nevertheless
the
city
and
guild
authorities
try
hard
to
protect
purchasers
from
misrepresentation
the
officers
are
always
making
unannounced
rounds
of
inspection
to
see
how
the
guild
ordinances
are
being
obeyed
the
fate
of
the
rascally
woolen
maker
has
been
noted
heavy
fines
have
also
been
imposed
lately
upon
a
rope
maker
who
put
linen
in
a
hemp
cord
and
a
cutler
who
put
silver
ornaments
in
a
bone
knife
handle
this
however
was
not
to
protect
purchasers
but
because
they
had
gone
outside
the
line
of
work
permitted
to
members
of
their
guild
and
trenched
upon
another
set
of
craftsmen
indeed
a
very
short
residence
in
pontdebois
makes
one
aware
that
within
the
chartered
commune
the
question
is
not
as
in
strictly
feudal
dominions
whose
is
he
but
to
what
guild
does
he
belong
everything
apparently
revolves
around
the
trade
and
craft
guilds
some
of
these
guilds
like
that
of
the
butchers
are
alleged
to
be
much
older
than
the
granting
of
the
charter
but
it
is
undeniable
that
the
organizations
have
multiplied
and
grown
in
power
since
that
precious
document
was
obtained
each
special
industry
goes
to
the
seigneur
in
this
city
to
the
bishop
for
a
special
grant
of
privileges
and
for
a
fee
he
will
usually
satisfy
the
petitioners
especially
as
they
desire
the
privileges
mainly
to
protect
them
against
their
fellow
craftsmen
not
against
himself
in
paris
there
are
more
than
three
hundred
and
fifty
separate
professions
in
pontdebois
they
are
much
fewer
yet
the
number
seems
high
many
guilds
have
only
a
few
members
apiece
but
even
the
smallest
is
mortally
jealous
of
its
prerogatives
one
mystery
makes
men

women
another

time
ago
the
last
mentioned
sold
some
alleged

seemed

bitter

brought
by
the
women
shoemakers
christian
charity
among
the
guildsmen
has
not
been
restored
yet
in
paris
they
say
that
the
tailors
are
pushing
a
case
against
the
dealers
because
the
latter
repair
their
garments
so
completely
as
to
make
them

will
soon
be

sidenote
division
and
regulations
of
guilds
such
friction
arises
of
course
because
each
guild
is
granted
a
strict
monopoly
of
trade
within
certain
prescribed
limits
a
saddle
maker
from
a
strange
city
who
started
a
shop
without
being
admitted
to
the
proper
guild
would
soon
find
his
shop
closed
his
products
burned
and
his
own
feet
in
the
stocks
by
the
town
donjon
the
guilds
are
supposed
to
be
under
strict
regulations
however
in
return
for
these
privileges
their
conditions
of
labor
are
laid
down
as
are
the
hours
and
days
of
working
the
precise
quality
of
their
products
is
fixed
and
sometimes
even
the
size
of
the
articles
and
the
selling
price
night
work
as
a
rule
is
forbidden
because
one
can
not
then
see
to
produce
perfect
goods
although
carpenters
are
allowed
to
make
coffins
after
sunset
on
days
before
festivals
everyone
must
close
by
and
on
feast
days
only
pastry
shops
selling
cakes
and
sweetmeats
are
allowed
to
be
open
violaters
are
subject
to
a
fine
which
goes
partly
to
the
guild
corporation
partly
to
the
town
treasury
and
these
fines
form
a
good
part
of
the
municipal
revenue
the
guilds
are
not
labor
unions
the
controlling
members
are
all
masters
the
employers
of
labor
although
usually
doing
business
on
a
very
small
scale
a
guild
is
also
a
religious
and
benevolent
institution
every
corporation
has
its
patron
saint
with
a

the
road
to
full
guild
membership
is
a
fairly
difficult
one
yet
it
can
be
traversed
by
lads
of
good
morals
and
legitimate
birth
if
they
have
application
and
intelligence
a
master
can
have
from
one
to
three
apprentices
and
also
his
own
son
if
he
has
one
who
desires
to
learn

to
twelve

more
difficult
the

the
longer
the
service
thus
it
takes
a
apprenticeship
to
become
a
qualified
jeweler
the
lads
thus
bound
out
can
not
ordinarily
quit
their
master
under
any
circumstances
before
the
proper
time
if
they
run
away

cold

can

may

wages

the

he
is
bound

teach
them
his

to
protect
them

enough
of
course
matters
end
by
the
favorite
apprentice
marrying
his
master

and
practically
taking
over
the
establishment
at
the
end
of
the
apprenticeship
the
young
industrialist
becomes
a
hired
worker
perhaps
in
his
old
master
shop
perhaps
somewhere
else
he
is
engaged
and
paid
by
the
week
and
often
changes
employers
many
times
while
in
this
stage
of
his
career
the
guild
protects
him
against
gross
exploitation
but
his
hours
are
long
from
to
during
the
summer
months
finally
if
he
has
led
a
moral
life
proved
a
good
workman
and
accumulated
a
small
capital
he
may
apply
to
the
syndics
for
admission
as
a
full
master
himself
a
kind
of
examination
takes
place
if
for
example
he
has
been
a
weaver
he
must
produce
an
extremely
good
bolt
of
cloth
and
show
skill
in
actually
making
and
adjusting
the
parts
of
his
loom
this
ordeal
passed
he
pays
a
fee
divisible
between
the
city
and
the
guild
and
undergoes
an
initiation
full
of
horseplay
and
absurd
allegory

candidate
for
the
position
of
baker
must
solemnly
present
a

full
of
walnuts
and
wafers
to
the
chief
syndic
and
upon
the
latter
accepting
the
contents
the
candidate
deliberately
breaks
the
pot
against
the
wall
a
proclamation
that
he
is
now
a
full
member

the
last
act
is

the
expense
of
the
new

there
is
one
quarter
of
the
town

the
aliquis
visitors
hardly
dare
to
enter
thrust
away
in
miserable
hovels
wedged
against
one
angle
of
the
walls
live
the
accursed
race
the
jews
here
are
people
with
oriental
physiognomies
they
are
exceedingly
obsequious
to
christians
but
the
latter
do
not
trust
them
these
bearded
men
with
earrings
these
women
with
bright
kerchiefs
of
eastern
stuffs
all
seem
to
be
conducting
little
shops
where
can
be
bought
the
cheapest
furniture
household
utensils
and
particularly
old
clothes
in
pontdebois
in
this
quarter
too
is
a
small
stone
building
which
conon
and
his
followers
wonder
that
the
echevins
suffer
to
exist
a
very
ancient
synagogue
for
the
jewish
colony
is
as
old
as
the
town
the
few
christians
who
have
periled
their
souls
by
venturing
inside
say
the
windows
are
very
small
and
that
the
dark
grimy
interior
is
lighted
by
dim
lamps
here
also
are
strange
ancient
books
written
in
a
character
which
no
gentile
can
interpret
but
by
whispered
report
containing
fearful
blasphemies
against
the
catholic
faith
sidenote
the
jews
and
money
lending
why
are
such
folk
permitted
in
pontdebois
maître
othon
has
to
explain
that
if
god
has
consigned
these
jews
to
eternal
damnation
he
has
permitted
many
of
them
while
in
this
world
to
possess
inordinate
riches
some
of
the
most
of
these
persons
who
are
compelled
by
law
to
wear
a
saffron
circle
on
their
breasts
can
actually
find
moneys
sufficient
to
pay
the
costs
of
a
duke
campaign
every
great
seigneur
has
his
jew
and
the
king
has
the
royal
jew
who
will
loan
him
money
when
no
christian
will
do
so
in
order
to
wage
his
wars
or
to
push
more
peaceful
undertakings
the
jews
are
indeed
hard
to
do
without
because
the
church
strictly
forbids
the
loaning
of
money
on
usury
yet
somehow
it
seems
very
difficult
to
borrow
large
sums
simply
upon
the
prospect
of
the
bare
repayment
of
the
same
the
jews
with
no
fear
for
their
souls
do
not
hesitate
to
lend
on
interest
sometimes
graspingly
demanding
forty
fifty
and
even
sixty
per
cent
this
is
outrageous
but
ofttimes
money
must
be
had
and
what
if
no
christian
will
lend
there
are
certain
worthy
men
especially
lombards
of
north
italy
who
say
that
it
were
well
if
the
church
allowed
lending
at
reasonable
interest
and
they
are
beginning
to
make
loans
accordingly
this
suggestion
however
savors
of
heresy
in
the
meantime
the
jews
continue
despised
maltreated
and
mobbed
every
good
friday
but
nevertheless
almost
indispensable
illustration
chartres
the
great
object
which
brings
so
many
visitors
to
pontdebois
is
the
annual
fair
held
every
august
in
the
field
by
the
river
just
south
of
the
town
then
can
be
purchased
many
articles
so
unusual
that
they
are
not
regularly
on
sale
in
the
city
shops
or
even
at
the
more
general
market
which
is
held
in
the
square
before
the
donjon
upon
each
thursday
the
pontdebois
fair
can
not
indeed
compete
in
extensiveness
with
the
rouen
or
dijon
fairs
the
famous
lendit
fair
near
denis
and
paris
nor
above
all
with
the
great
champagne
fairs
at
troyes
and
elsewhere
for
these
are
the
best
places
for
buying
and
selling
in
all
france
nevertheless
one
must
not
despise
a
fair
which
attracts
nearly
all
the
good
folk
of
quelqueparte
who
are
intent
on
gains
or
purchases
in
some
respects
the
fair
has
many
features
like
the
tourney
at
aliquis
long
files
of
travelers
on
beasts
or
on
foot
are
approaching
innumerable
tents
are
flaunting
bright
pennons
and
the
same
jongleurs
who
swarmed
to
make
music
or
to
exhibit
tricks
at
conon
festival
are
coming
hither
also
but
the
travelers
are
not
as
a
rule
knights
in
bright
armor
but
soberly
clad
merchants
their
attendants
lead
not
destrers
but
heavily
laden
sumpter
mules
the
tents
are
not
given
over
to
gallant
feasting
and
gentle
intrigues
but
to
vigorous
chaffering
for
that
thing
which
all
knights
affect
to
despise
good
money
therefore
although
the
bustle
seems
the
same
the
results
are
very
different
there
is
a
special
complication
at
these
fairs
in
what
kind
of
money
shall
we
pay
the
royal
coinage
is
supposed
to
circulate
everywhere
and
to
represent
the
standard
but
the
king
power
can
not
suppress
a
whole
swarm
of
local
coinages
there
are
deniers
of
anjou
maine
rouen
touraine
toulouse
poitou
bordeaux
and
many
other
districts
besides
the
good
royal
coins
from
paris
also
a
plentiful
circulation
of
constantinople
bezants
venetian
zechins
german
groats
and
english
silver
shillings
in
addition
to
many
outlandish
infidel
coins
of
very
debatable
value
to
add
to
the
trouble
there
are
varying
standards
for
weights
and
measures
you
have
to
make
sure
as
to
which
one
is
used
in
every
purchase

one
needs
time
patience
and
a

head
to
trade
happily
at
this
fair
when
you
consider
the
number
of
tolls
levied
everywhere

a

on
about
every
load
that
crosses
a
bridge
traverses
a
stretch

wonder
grows
that
it
seems
worth

transport

merchants
have
to
travel
almost
with
one
hand
in
their
pockets
to
satisfy
the
collectors
of
the
local
seigneurs
the
result
is
that
almost
nothing
is
brought
from
a
distance
which
is
not
fairly
portable
and
for
which
there
is
a
demand
not
readily
met
by
the
local
workshops
nevertheless
a
good
fair
is
a
profitable
asset
to
an
intelligent
seigneur
the
present
fair
was
instituted
seventy
years
ago
by
an
unusually
enterprising
lord
bishop
he
induced
the
barons
of
the
region
to
agree
to
treat
visitors
to
the
fair
reasonably
and
to
give
them
protection
against
robbers
he
also
established
strict
regulations
to
secure
for
every
trader
fair
play
when
disposing
of
his
wares
commissioned
sergeants
to
patrol
the
grounds
and
set
up
a
competent
provost
court
right
among
the
tents
so
that
persons
falling
into
a
dispute
could
get
a
quick
decision
without
expensive
litigation
in
return
he
laid
a
small
tax
on
every
article
sold
the
arrangement
worked
well
succeeding
bishops
have
been
wise
enough
to
realize
that
contented
merchants
are
more
profitable
than
those

the
wares
at

are
almost
equally
extensive

may
be
a

resume

they
have
absorbed
many
new
ideas
as
to
how
they
can

to

advantage
yet
probably
most
of
them
are
grumbling
against

these
regulations
for
a
long
period
were
of
marked
value
for
insuring
a
high
grade
of
workmanship
according

traditional
methods
but
later
they
became
a
most
serious
impediment
to
any
improvements
in
industrial
processes
originality
new
designs
and
devices
were
practically
prohibited
and
some
industries
were
destined
to
remain
almost
stagnant
down
to
the
french
revolution
among
the
oldest
traceable
guilds
in
paris
were
the
master
chandlers
and
oilmen
who
received
royal
privileges
in
the
butchers
tanners
shoemakers
drapers
furriers
and
purse
makers
were
other
old
parisian
guilds
the
fullers
were
always
suing
the
weavers
could
the
latter
if
they
wished
dye
the
cloth
which
they
themselves
had
woven
bakers
were
always
at

with

who
baked
their

certain

would
naturally
be
the
patrons
of
certain
particular

joseph

peter

a
master
could
not
employ
more
than
one
or
two
paid
workers
lest
he
build
up
too
big
a
business
and
ruin
his
competitors
the
guild
system
seems
deliberately
contrived
to
perpetuate
the
existence
of
a
great
number
of
industries
the
extreme
difficulty
of
collecting
loans
made
to
powerful
seigneurs
went
far
to
explain
these
astonishing
rates
of
interest
the
chances
of
an
unfriended
jew
being
unable
to
collect
any
part
of
his
loan
were
extremely
great
as
a
rule
his
hopes
lay
in
becoming
the
indispensable
man
of
business
and
financier
of
a
king
or
other
great
lord
who
would
support
him
in
recovering
principal
and
interest
from
lesser
debtors
in
return
for
great
favors
to
himself
thus
richard
i
of
england
is
alleged
to
have
made
the
jews
settled
in
his
realm
furnish
nearly
of
his
entire
revenues
as
recompense
for
allowing
them
to
use
his
courts
to
collect
from
their
private
debtors
mediæval
coinages
varied
to
such
an
extreme
extent
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
make
correct
general
statements
about
their
modern
values
in
the
time
of
philip
augustus
probably
the
north
french
money
table
was
something
like
this

earlier
sous
deniers
obols
a
sou
merely
a
money
of
account
was
equal
to
about
modern
francs
gold
and
the
denier
a
regular
coin
to
about
one
franc
cents
gold
the
copper
obols
were
thus
worth
about
one
cent
but
money
in
the
feudal
age
had
a
purchasing
power
equal
to
at

ten
times
what
it
is
and
attempts
at
close
estimating
are
decidedly
futile
the

took
particular

to
assure

the

after

and
his

have
soiled
their
gentle
blood
by
discreet
trafficking
at
the

the

must
needs
pay
a
ceremonious
call
upon
the

he
might
indeed
have
accepted
lodgings
at
the

it
is
well
not
to
be
put
under
too
many
obligations
even
to
so
conciliatory
a
prelate
as
bishop

between
the
lay
and
ecclesiastical
lords
there
are
compliments
but
little
affection
both
unite
in
despising
the
villein
and
distrusting
the
monks
but
there
the
harmony
often
ends
the
lord
bishop
occupies
almost
the
apex
of
the
ecclesiastical
power
barring
only
the
pope
and
his
cardinals
and
all
the
lay
world
ought
to
honor
the
clergy
a
familiar
story
illustrates
the
recognition
due
even
to
the
humbler
churchmen
once
martin
was
asked
to
sup
with
the
emperor
he
was
offered
the
cup
before
it
was
passed
to
the
sovereign
this
was
a
great
honor
he
was
supposed
merely
to
touch
the
vessel
to
his
lips
then
hand
it
on
to
his
majesty
instead
to
the
surprise
yet
admiration
of
all
he
gave
it
to
a
poor
priest
standing
behind
him
thereby
teaching
the
plain
lesson
that
a
servant
of
god
even
of
the
lowest
rank
deserves
honor
above
the
highest
secular
potentate
the
clergy
is
divided
into
two
great
sections
the
religious
the
monks
and
the
secular
clergy
who
are
in
the
world
and
have
the
cure
of
souls
the
parish
priests
belong
of
course
to
this
second
class
they
celebrate
mass
and
administer
the
sacraments
and
consolations
of
religion
they
are
possibly
reckoned
by
the
laity
a
little
less
holy
than
the
monks
but
their
power
is
incalculable
at
their
head
in
each
diocese
ecclesiastical
province
is
the
bishop
since
the
wealth
of
the
church
embraces
at
least
one
fifth
of
all
the
real
estate
of
france
and
the
control
of
this
vast
property
is
largely
vested
in
the
bishops
it
is
easy
to
see
what
holding
such
an
office
implies
there
is
no
seigneur
in
quelqueparte
so
rich
as
bishop
nivelon
barring
only
the
duke
himself
and
the

would
justly
hesitate
quite

be
hard
for

to
realize
the
part
that
is
played
by
the
church
in
the
feudal
centuries
the
clergy
are
far
more
than
spiritual
guides
they
are
directors
of
education
and
maintain
about
all
there
is
of
intellectual
life

and

they

preserve

he
can
often

the
test
is
not
to
produce
a

the

thought
well
of
the
young

were
anxious
to

was
obtained
from

after

possibly
some

since
then
nivelon
has
ruled
his

he
has
been
neither
a
great
theologian
nor
a
man
of
letters
as
are
certain
contemporaneous
bishops
nor
a
politician
and
a
mitered

like

there
have
been
no
scandalous
luxuries
at

he
has
never

which
none
can
deny
are
numerous
there
is
plenty
of
excuse
for
nivelon
if
he
allows
religious
tasks
to
be
swamped
by
secular
ones
he
apparently
differs
largely
from
a
seigneur
in
that
his
interests
and
obligations
are
more
complex

his
direct
domains
are
parish

he

a

therefore
if
he
wishes
can
put
in
almost
his
whole

or
if
he

he
can
almost
always
find
the

enmeshed
in
financial

it
will
tax
his
best
energies
to
disentangle
all
these

supposed
to
do

get

what
wonder
considering
mortal
frailty
that
many
men
who
seek
the
episcopate
for
temporal
advantage
often
bring
their
great
office
into
contempt
it
is
true
that
sometimes
very
worldly
young
clerics
when
once
elected
are
sobered
by
their
responsibilities
and
become
admirable
prelates
there
is
a
story
of
a
college
of
canons
which
decided
to
elect
to
the
vacant
bishopric
a
fellow
member
who
was
excellent
in
mother
wit
but
who
when
they
sought
him
to
tell
of
his
honor
was
actually
dicing
in
a
tavern
forth
they
dragged
him
weeping
and
struggling
to
the
cathedral
and
thrust
him
into
the
episcopal
chair
once
enthroned
however
he
proved
sober
and
capable
thus
proving
how
despite
his
original
sins
the
free
gift
of
virtue
which
had
come
upon
him
by
consecration
shaped
the
possibilities
of
an
excellent
nature
sidenote
evil
and
luxurious
prelates
this
is
all
very
well
but
the
sacred
honor
does
not
always
work

the
monks
never
conceal
the
faults

they
bribe
and
flatter
in
order
to
extort
instead
of
being
protectors
of
the
church
they
are
its
ravishers
or
again
jesus
wore
hair
cloth
they
silken
vestments
they
care
not
for
souls
but
for
falcons
not
for
the
poor
but
for
hunting
dogs
the
churches
from
being
holy
places
have
become
market
places
and
haunts
for
brigands
most
of
this
is
mere
rhetoric
and
such
sweeping
generalizations
are
unjust
if
the
majority
of
bishops
are
not
ascetics
neither
are
they
rapacious
libertines
nevertheless
even
as
one
abbey
brings
contempt
on
many
austere
establishments
so
a
few
faithless
bishops
bring
scandal
on
the
whole
episcopate
some
years
ago
pope
innocent
iii
had
to
denounce
a
south
french
bishop
as
serving
no
other
god
but
money
and
having
a
purse
in
place
of
a
heart
this
wretch
was
charged
with
selling
church
offices
or
leaving
them
vacant
in
order
to
seize
their
incomes
while
the
monks
and
canons
under
him
says
the
pope
were
laying
aside
the
habit
taking
wives
living
by
usury
and
becoming
lawyers
jongleurs
or
doctors
acts
like
these
have
forced
the
council
of
paris
in
to
forbid
bishops
to
wear
laymen
garments
or
luxurious
furs
to
use
decorated
saddles
or
golden
horse
bits
to
play
games
of
chance
to
go
hunting
to
swear
or
let
their
servants
swear
to
hear
matins
while
still
in
bed
or
excommunicate
innocent
people
out
of
mere
petulance
bishops
too
are
not
supposed
to
bear
arms
but
we
have
seen
how
they
sometimes
compromise
on
bloodless
heavy
maces
nivelon
occasionally
lets
a
secular
advocate
or
vidame
lead
his
feudal
levy
but
at
times
he
will
ride
in
person
a
bishop
of
course
was
king
philip
chief
of
staff
at
bouvines
although
in
excuse
it
should
be
said
he
had
been
the
member
of
a
military
monastic
order
but
bishop
odo
of
bayeux
fought
at
hastings
before
any
such
authorized
champions
of
the
church
existed
one
need
not
multiply
examples
that
bishops
shall
genuinely
refrain
from
warfare
is
really
a
pious
wish
not
easily
in
this
sinful
world
to
be
granted
a
bishop
can
however
justify
this
assertion
of
the
church
militant
he
must
fight
to
maintain
the
rights
of
the
bishopric
against
the
encroaching
nobility
around
the
royal
domain
conditions
are
reasonably
secure
but
here
in
quelqueparte
as
elsewhere
in
the
average
feudal
principalities
it
is
useless
to
ask
the
suzerain
to
do
very
much
to
defend
his
local
bishop
the
two
are
so
likely
to
be
very
unfriendly
themselves
anathemas
can
not
check
the
more
reckless
seigneurs
in
the
bishop
of
verdun
was
killed
in
a
riot
by
a
lance
thrust
and
in
this
very
year
the
bishop
of
puy
in
the
south
of
france
has
been
slain
by
noblemen
whom
he
had
excommunicated
the
murderers
have
doubtless
lost
their
souls
but
this
fact
does
not
recall
the
dead
jongleurs
who
echo
baronial
prejudices
are
always
making
fun
of
bishops
in
their
epics
alleging
that
they
lead
scandalous
lives
and
are
extraordinarily
avaricious
even
when
summoned
to
contribute
for
a
war
against
the
infidels
the
truth
is
the
bishops
being
often
recruited
from
the
nobility
frequently
keep
all
their
old
fighting
spirit
the
bishop
opposes
a
neighboring
viscount
just
as
the
viscount
will
oppose
his
other
neighbor
a
baron
frequently
enough
the
war
between
a
bishop
and
a
lay
seigneur
differs
in
no
respect
from
a
normal
feud
between
two
seigneurs
who
have
never
been
touched
by
tonsure
and
chrism
sidenote
friction
with
abbots
and
barons
there
are
other
frictions
less
bloody
but
even
more
distressing
to
the
church
if
there
is
an
exempt
abbey
in
the
diocese
independent
of
the
bishop
and
taking
orders
from
only
the
pope
the
abbot
and
the
bishop
are
often
anything
but
brethren
each
is
continually
complaining
about
the
other
to
the
vatican
however
even
if
the
local
abbey
is
not
directly
under
the
pope
its
head
is
likely
to
defy
the
bishop
as
much
as
possible
abbots
are
always
trying
to
put
themselves
on
equality
with
bishops
and
intriguing
at
rome
for
the
right
to
wear
episcopal
sandals
a
miter
etc
so
the
strength
of
the
church
is
wasted
to
the
great
joy
of
the
devil
it
is
counted
a
sign
that
the
bishop
of
pontdebois
and
the
abbot
of
aliquis
are
both
superior
prelates
that
their
relations
are
reasonably
harmonious
however
it
is
with
the
nobles
that
nivelon
has
his
main
troubles
one
of
the
reasons
why
conon
wishes
to
see
the
bishop
is
to
complain
of
how
certain
aliquis
peasants
are
being
induced
to
settle
on
the
church
lands
villeins
somehow
feel
that
they
are
better
treated
by
a
bishop
or
abbot
than
by
the
most
benevolent
of
seigneurs
there
is
good
living
under
the
cross
runs
the
proverb
also
the
baron
wishes
to
urge
the
bishop
not
to
excommunicate
a
fellow
noble
who
is
at
issue
with
the
prelate
over
some
hunting
rights
it
is
all
very
well
for
the
bishop
to
devote
to
the
evil
one
and
the
eternal
fire
a
really
sacrilegious
criminal
the
fact
remains
that
many
nobles
allege
that
they
are
excommunicated
and
unless
reinstated
lose
their
very
hopes
of
heaven
merely
because
they
have
differed
from
great
churchmen
as
to
extremely
secular
property
questions
the
fearful
ceremony
of
excommunication
is
liable
to
fall
into
contempt
except
when
used
in
the
most
undoubted
cases
a
resolute
baron
sure
of
his
cause
can
defy
the
anathema
and
if
his
followers
stand
by
him
may
hold
out
until
he
forces
a
compromise
if
the
struggle
is
bitter
however
the
bishop
has
another
weapon
he
can
put
the
offending
seigneur
lands
and
castles
under
the
interdict
doubtless
it
is
a
harsh
thing
to
deny
all
religious
services
and
sacraments
save
the
last
unction
to
the
dying
to
thousands
of
innocent
persons
merely
because
their
lord
persists
in
some
worldly
policy
yet
this
is
done
frequently
and
is
of
course
of
great
efficacy
in
getting
pious
people
and
especially
the
womenfolk
to
put
pressure
upon
their
seigneur
to
come
to
terms
with
the
church
sometimes
an
intermittent
interdict
is
established
thus
for
a
long
time
the
count
and
the
bishop
of
auxerre
were
at
enmity
the
count
a
hardened
scoffer
was
no
wise
troubled
by
excommunication
then
the
bishop
ordained
that
as
soon
as
the
count
entered
the
city
of
auxerre
all
the
offices
of
religion
except
baptism
and
last
unction
should
be
suspended
the
moment
he
and
his
men
departed
the
church
bells
rang
and
religious
life
resumed
the
instant
he
returned
there
was
more
bell
ringing
whereat
the
churches
were
closed
the
count
did
not
dare
to
stay
very
long
in
the
city
because
of
popular
murmurs
yet
he
and
the
bishop
kept
up
this
unedifying
war
for
fifteen
years
until
the
pope
induced
the
king
to
induce
the
count
to
submit
to
the
church
by
a
humiliating
penance
excommunication
and
interdict
are
thus
weapons
which
a
lord
spiritual
can
use
against
a
lord
temporal
to
supplement
crossbows
and
lances
unfortunately
they
have
fewer
terrors
against
foes
which
all
bishops
including
nivelon
have
within
their
own
household
the
chapters
of
canons
at
the
cathedrals
sidenote
a
chapter
of
canons
to
be
a
canon
is
almost
equal
to
enjoying
the
perquisites
of
some
less
valuable
bishopric
without
the
grievous
cares
of
the
episcopal
office
the
chapter
of
canons
constitutes
the
privileged
body
of
ecclesiastics
who
maintain
the
worship
at
the
cathedral
as
you
go
through
pontdebois
you
see
the
great
gray
mass
of
the
new
episcopal
church
rising
ahead
of
you
presently
a
solid
wall
is
reached
protected
by
a
gate
and
towers
this
is
the
cathedral
close
a
separate
compound
next
to
the
majestic
church
and
communicating
with
it
by
a
special
entrance
within
this
close
one
passes
under
strictly
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
here
is
a
pretentious
residence
the
bishop
palace
and
a
pleasant
garden
and
here
is
also
a
group
of
smaller
houses
the
habitations
of
the
canons
these
last
form
the
chapter
of
canons
who
enjoy
as
a
corporate
body
a
quantity
of
lands
seigneurial
rights
officers
and
goodly
income
quite
separate
from
the
bishops
supposedly
they
are
controlled
by
a
rule
but
it
is
a
rule
far
less
severe
than
that
of
most
monks
the
chapter
here
as
elsewhere
is
largely
recruited
from
the
local
noble
houses
church
law
nominally
forbids
it
but
the
fact
remains
that
many
if
not
most
canons
are
practically
nominated
whenever
there
is
a
vacancy
in
the
chapter
by
this
or
that
powerful
seigneur
to
get
a
relative
a
prebend
income
from
endowment
as
canon
is
often
equivalent
to
providing
for
life
for
a
kinsman
to
whom
you
might
otherwise
have
to
cede
a
castle
it
is
well
understood
that
since
years
ago
a
baron
of
aliquis
endowed
with
large
gifts
a
certain
prebend
his
successors
have
the
naming
of
its
occupants
as
often
as
it
falls
vacant
after
conon
has
visited
the
bishop
he
will
pay
a
friendly
call
on
his
canon
not
without
a
certain
desire
to
verify
the
reports
that
this
elderly
cleric
is
in
poor
health
and
not
long
for
the
present
world
if
such
rumors
are
correct
the
baron
must
consider
whether
a
certain
remote
cousin
feels
summoned
to
endure
the
hardships
of
a
religious
life
and
what
substantial
favors
this
ambitious
cousin
and
his
father
could
give
conon
for
the
privilege
a
canon
who
performs
his
duties
is
hardly
idle
he
is
supposed
to
take
part
in
the
incessant
and
often
extraordinarily
elaborate
services
at
every
cathedral
he
should
possess
a
good
physical
presence
and
intone
the
offices
with
elegance
and
precision
every
week
day
he
has
to
chant
through
five
services
and
on
sunday
through
nine
on
certain
great
feasts
and
holidays
there
are
still
more
anthems
responses
psalms
prayers
hymns
also
public
processions
should
keep
him
turning
leaves
of
the
ponderous
ordinaries
and
manuals
until
he
knows
every
chant
therein
by
heart
sidenote
worldliness
of
canons
it
is
possible
however
to
find
substitutes
in
all
the
less
important
services
there
are
plenty
of
humbly
born
poor
priests
hovering
around
every
cathedral
glad
of
a
pittance
to
act
as
the
lordly
deputies
a
worldly
minded
canon
therefore
does
not
feel
this
duty
of
chanting
to
be
very
arduous
of
course
if
he
is
absent
too
often
or
from
very
important
ceremonies
there
is
comment
scandal
and
a
reprimand
from
the
bishop
but
a
wise
bishop
does
not
interfere
with
his
canons
except
on
grave
provocation
they
form
an
independent
corporation
with
privileges
their
head
the
dean
is
entirely
conscious
that
he
is
the
second
cleric
in
the
diocese
and
that
he
need
not
look
to
the
bishop
for
dignity
and
glory
the
bishop
himself
has
been
to
a
certain
extent
chosen
by
these
very
canons
it
will
depend
considerably
upon
their
attitude
toward
him
whether
his
dying
moments
are
not
embittered
by
the
knowledge
that
his
dearest
enemy
is
not
to
be
elected
his
successor
finally
a
chapter
of
canons
can
make
a
bishop
life
a
gehenna
by
filing
complaints
against
him
with
the
archbishop
always
glad
to
interfere
or
directly
at
rome
when
men
say
that
nivelon
has
got
along
tolerably
with
his
chapter
as
well
as
with
his
neighboring
abbot
and
seigneurs
they
prove
again
that
he
is
an
unusually
tactful
prelate
it
is
a
fine
thing
therefore
to
be
one
of
the
canons
young
or
old
who
inhabit
the
sacred
close
at
pontdebois
they
can
be
identified
by
their
special
costume
the
loose
surplice
of
linen
with
wide
sleeves
covering
the
cassock
and
by
the
amice
a
headdress
of
thick
black
stuff
with
a
flat
top
and
terminating
on
each
corner
in
a
kind
of
horn
baron
conon
points
out
to
his
sons
these
men
of
florid
complexion
contented
and
portly
moving
with
slow
dignity
about
the
cathedral
close
how
would
you
enjoy
being
a
canon
he
asks
of
small
anseau
his
youngest
boy
there
are
no
better
dinners
than
those
in
the
chapter
refectory
and
remember
that
your
brother
will
have
to
get
the
castle

shakes
his

and
scowls
i
might
be
a
monk
yes
he
rejoined
monks
save
their
souls
and
go
to
heaven
but
a
canon
ugh
they
must
weary
god
by
their
idleness
françois
may
have
aliquis
but
let
him
give
me
a
good
destrer
and
good
armor
i
will
seek
my
fortune
and
win
new
lands
the
saints
bless
your
words
cries
his
father
there
spoke
a
true
aliquis
and
remember
this
when
cavalier
or
jongleur
rails
hardest
against
worthless
churchmen
it
is
not
bishop
priest
or
monk
whom
half
the
time
they
have
in
their
pates
but
slothful
canons
yet
i
must
see
the
revered
father
flavien
and
learn
if
his
cough
really
as
bad
as
they
say
nivelon
secures
peace
by
letting
his
canons
largely
alone
to
their
great
content
fortunately
the
good
laymen
of
quelqueparte
do
not
depend
entirely
upon
their
spiritual
administrations
the
cure
of
souls
rests
with
the
parish
priests
these
are
scattered
all
through
the
diocese
their
management
takes
up
a
large
part
of
the
crowded
time
illustration
a
deacon
thirteenth
century
he
wears
an
albe
the
dalmatica
the
amice
the
stole
and
the
maniple
from
a
statue
in
the
cathedral
of
chartres
sidenote
appointment
of
parish
priests
every
church
requires
at
least
one
priest
in
residence
to
say
mass
and
afford
religious
comfort
to
the
laity
if
competent
bishops
could
always
have
appointed
this
clergy
much
sorrow
would
have
been
eliminated
unfortunately
the
bishop
can
only
name
a
fraction
practically
every
noncathedral
church
has
its
patron
the
heir
or
beneficiary
of
the
wealthy
personage
who
once
endowed
the
local
establishment
this
patron
may
be
the
bishop
himself
but
often
the
honor
may
be
enjoyed
by
an
abbey
or
a
chapter
of
canons
or
in
a
majority
of
cases
by
some
very
secular
seigneur
conon
will
say
i
hold
the
patronage
of
eight
churches
just
as
he
will
say
i
hold
aliquis
castle
the
patron
is
entitled
to
a
share
of
the
tithe
tax
for
religious
purposes
and
other
income
of
the
parish
before
turning
the
remainder
over
to
the
officiating
priest
he
can
in
addition
present
to
the
living
that
is
name
the
new
curé
for
the
parish
upon
every
vacancy
the
bishop
is
supposed
indeed
to
confirm
the
candidate
and
should
not
do
so
without
investigation
as
to
the
other
fitness
but
he
will
hesitate
to
offend
the
patron
by
refusal
to
proceed
with
the
ceremony
unless
the
impediment
is
gross
and
patent
the
candidate
is
asked
to
decline
a
latin
noun
to
conjugate
a
simple
verb
to
chant
a
few
familiar
psalms
with
fair
voice
that
is
probably
about
all
the
test
for
learning
to
make
matters
worse
if
the
candidate
fears
his
own
bishop
he
can
go
to
another
diocese
and
probably
get
a
licence
from
a
less
exacting
prelate
a
bishop
is
obliged
to
honor
the
certificate
issued
by
his
equal
he
can
seldom
then
refuse
after
that
to
invest
the
priest
with
the
parish
the
last
stage
of
scandal
comes
when
the
patron
actually
takes
money
for
presenting
a
candidate
this
is
of
course
a
terrible
crime
against
the
church
it
is
simony
after
the
fashion
of
the
accursed
simon
magnus
who
was
guilty
of
trying
to
purchase
the
gift
of
god
with
money
nivelon
has
just
had
to
induct
into
a
parish
an
worldly
fellow
the
son
of
a
rich
peasant
who
somehow
persuaded
the
viscount
of
foretvert
that
he
was
fit
to
have
the
spiritual
conduct
of
five
hundred
christians
the
bishop
has
heard
ugly
rumors
about
two
hundred
deniers
yet
for
lack
of
real
proof
is
helpless
it
is
feared
these
scandals
are
frequent
but
many
times
if
candidate
and
seigneur
are
willing
to
imperil
their
souls
what
can
be
done
as
a
rule
however
conscientious
patrons
name
lads
from
their
barony
the
sons
of
thrifty
peasants
or
of
petty
nobles
who
have
been
to
the
school

who
have
developed
an
aptitude
for
saying

rather
than
for

the
favor
is
bestowed
rather
as
a
reward
for

by
the
youth
family
or
to
insure
the
same
in
the
future
than
for
any
direct

consideration
to
be
a
parish
priest
is
not
a
very
high
honor
after
the
patron
has
taken
his
share
of
the
tithe
and
the
bishop
another
share
the
curé
is
likely
to
be
left
with
barely
enough
income
to
put
him
among
the
better
class
of
peasants
yet
after
all
he
is
now
caught
up
into
the
great
body
politic
of
the
church
the
latter
will
not
let
him
starve
it
will
give
him
a
decent
old
age
it
will
protect
him
against
those
gross
cruelties
which
seigneurs
may
inflict
on
any
peasant
it
will
make
him
the
most
important
individual
in
the
average
village
often
the
only
person
therein
understanding
the
mysteries
of
parchments
if
he
is
a
worthy
man
his
influence
as
counselor
friend
and
arbiter
will
be
almost
boundless
he
will
receive
a
personal
respect
almost
equal
to
that
due
to
a
cavalier
finally
there
is
always
the
chance
that
he
may
win

merit

father
grégoire
conon
chaplain
although
nominally
only
a
poor
priest
is
probably
more
influential
in
aliquis
than
sire
eustace
the
seneschal
conon
sometimes
complains
good
naturedly
that
he
is
more
powerful
than
conon
himself
so
then
apart
from
any
desire
for
strictly
religious
leadership
it
is
no
bad
thing
for
a
lad
of
humble
origin
to
be
appointed
parish
priest
sidenote
evil
and
faithful
priests
if
however
to
receive
a
parish
means
not
a
holy
trust
but
a
sordid
opportunity
what
a
chance
for
making
the
fiends
rejoice
every
jongleur
when
he
runs
out
of
more
legitimate
stories
chatters
about
godless
priests
charges
against
the
parish
clergy
are
the
small
coin
of
filthy
gossip
how
they
violate
their
vows
of
celibacy
in
a
shameless
manner
how
they
frequent
taverns
take
part
in
low
brawls
drink
up
to
their
throats
and
lie
torpid
in
the
fields
how
they
fight
with
their
parishioners
how
they
sell
strong
drink
like
tapsters
how
they
play
dice
gamble
and
often
cheat
their
opponents
etc
another
set
of
charges
is
that
if
their
means
admit
they
wear
armor
like
nobles
or
dress
like
foppish
laymen
and
ride
out
with
hawks
or
dogs
more
familiar
still
are
the
accusations
of
extreme
covetousness
of
the
outrageous
exaction
of
fees
for
administering
the
sacraments
even
to
the
dying
of
performing
shameless
marriages
for
money
of
refusing
burial
services
until
they
have
been
bribed
and
in
short
of
converting
themselves
into
financial
harpies
all
this
is
undeniable
yet
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
number
of
parish
clergy
is
very
great
and
the
proportion
of
evildoers
is
considering
their
manner
of
appointment
no
more
than
might
be
expected
many
of
the
parish
priests
are
true
ministers
of
god
who
counsel
the
simple
persuade
the
erring
comfort
the
sorrowing
and
leave
the
world
better
than
they
found
it
a
few
too
spend
their
leisure
in
genuine
pursuit
of
learning
like
that
father
lambert
of
ardes
in
flanders
who
is
deeply
read
in
old
latin
authors
and
christian
fathers
and
who
has
composed
an
excellent
local
chronicle
worthy
to
rank
with
the
best
produced
in
the
monasteries
taken
therefore
at
large
despite
much
dross
the
men
of
the
church
do
not
cast
away
their
great
opportunity
if
alms
and
charity
relieve
the
wretched
if
letters
and
science
have
a
genuine
power
if
the
world
retains
other
ideals
than
those
of
the
tourney
the
feud
and
the
foray
if
villeins
are
taught
that
they
too
are
men
with
immortal
souls
no
less
than
are
the
barons
the
glory
belongs
surely
not
to
the
castle
but
to
the
monastery
and
to
the
parish
and
when
a
good
churchman
dies
especially
of
course
if
he
has
been
an
effective
and
benignant
bishop
all
the
region
knows
its
loss
when
the
late
bishop
of
auxerre
departed
it
was
written
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
how
great
was
the
mourning
throughout
the
entire
city
and
with
what
groaning
and
lamentations
sorrow
was
shown
by
all
who
followed
his
funeral
while
of
the
great
and
good
bishop
maurice
of
paris
builder
of
notre
dame
it
was
recorded
when
he
passed
in
that
he
was
a
vessel
of
affluence
a
fertile
olive
tree
in
the
house
of
the
lord
he
shone
by
his
knowledge
his
preaching
his
many
alms
and
his
good
deeds
like
every
other
institution
the
church
of
the
feudal
age
is
entitled
to
be
judged
by
its
best
and
not
by
its
worst
footnotes
of
the
real
estate
of
germany
was
alleged
to
have
belonged
to
the
church
of
course
much
of
this
belonged
to
monasteries
to
the
endowments
of
canons
cathedral
clergy
or
of
the
parish
priests
but
the
bishops
assuredly
enjoyed
or
at
least
controlled
the
lion
share
in
the
case
of
heretics
the
church
did
not
execute
the
offenders
by
its
own
officers
it
merely
relaxed
them
to
secular
officials
who
at
once
put
the
old
civil
laws
against
misbelievers
in
force
of
course
the
church
could
not
secure
the
immunity
of
traitors
and
great
criminals
yet
even
those
were
usually
treated
more
tenderly
if
they
could
claim
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
one
could
go
on
multiplying
such
cases
for
example
maurice
of
sully
who
was
bishop
of
paris
under
philip
augustus
was
the
son
of
a
poor
peasant
he
managed
his
diocese
admirably
and
bequeathed
not
merely
considerable
wealth
to
his
relatives
but
large
properties
to
two
abbeys
and
also
funds
for
poor
relief
the
question
of
the
technical
relations
at
this
time
of
both
papacy
and
royalty
to
the
appointment
and
investiture
of
french
bishops
is
one
that
must
be
left
for
more
detailed
and
learned
volumes
some
abbeys
would
be
directly
under
the
bishop
and
liable
to
visitation
and
discipline
by
him
at
any
time
others
would
be
supposed
to
be
directly
under
the
authority
of
the
pope
see
but
the
vatican
would
often
send
orders
to
a
competent
bishop
to
investigate
and
act
on
charges
against
them
manasses
a
great
cleric
chancellor
of
the
chapter
of
amiens
caused
himself
to
be
represented
on
his
seal
not
holding
a
pious
book
as
was
usual
but
in
hunting
costume
on
horseback
a
bird
on
his
wrist
and
a
dog
following
he
was
evidently
a
worldly
noble
who
had
the
tastes
of
his
class
and
led
a
noble
life
see
chapter
xxiv
the
cathedral
and
its
builders
baron
conon
and
adela
had
still
another
duty
ere
they
returned
to
aliquis
they
were
fain
to
go
with
their
sons
and
each
burn
a
tall
candle
before
the
altar
of
our
lady
in
the
cathedral
all
dwellers
near
pontdebois
are
intensely
proud
of
their
great
church
it
has
been
building
now
these
forty
years
at
last
it
is
fairly
complete
although
the
left
tower
has
still
to
be
carried
up
to
the
belfry
and
very
many
niches
lack
the
sculptured
saints
presently
to
occupy
them
a
worthy
cathedral
like
a
worthy
character
is
growing
continually
probably
the
feudal
age
will
end
before
notre
dame
de
pontdebois
is
completed
as
its
pious
designers
have
intended
the
cathedral
is
the
center
for
a
large
group
of
buildings
whereof
most
are
in
the
noble
pointed
gothic
style
of
architecture
as
just
explained
in
the
sacred
close
there
is
the
bishop
palace
and
the
houses
of
the
canons
there
are
also
a
cloister
for
promenading
a
school
much
like
that
at
the
monastery
a
room
for
a
library
and
a
synodal
hall
for
meetings
of
the
canons
and
where
the
bishop
can
conduct
litigation
there
is
in
addition
a
hospital
for
sick
clerics
the
whole
forms
a
little
world
sequestered
from
the
uproar
and
sordid
bustle
of
the
marts
and
workshops
of
pontdebois
as
you
enter
the
cathedral
compound
exterior
cares
are
suddenly
left
behind
you
a
great
sense
of
peace
is
realized
one
hears
the
wind
softly
whistling
through
the
soaring
tracery
of
the
massive
right
tower
there
is
a
whirring
flutter
of
doves
from
their
homes
under
the
flying
buttresses
through
a
section
opened
in
the
floral
tracery
of
a
great
window
comes
the
rumbling
of
an
organ
and
the
deep
gregorian
chant
of
some
hymn
from
the
psalter
utter
contrast
it
all
is
either
to
the
hammering
and
chaffering
of
the
city
or
the
equally
worldly
clatter
of
the
castle
court
the
vast
tower
pointing
upward
speaks
even
to
the
thoughtless
fortress
and
city
trade
and
tourney
endure
only
for
the
instant
the
things
of
the
spirit
abide
forever
the
cathedral
by
its
vast
and
soaring
bulk
completely
dwarfs
the
comparatively
small
and
mean
houses
of
the
town
they
are
of
thatch
and
wood
it
is
of
stone
they
lack
even
a
tawdry
magnificence
the
cathedral
could
gaze
with
contempt
on
royal
palaces
this
fact
teaches
even
more
clearly
than
words
the
enormous
place
occupied
by
the
church
in
the
feudal
age
it
is
not
by
its
literature
and
learning
though
these
are
not
to
be
despised
but
its
sacred
architecture
and
that
the
spirit
of
this
era
displays
its
power
and
originality
in
contemplating
so
magnificent
a
fabric
it
is
best
to
remember
that
it
is
the
work
of
men
of
ardent
faith
profoundly
convinced
that
in
the
church
building
there
dwells
continually
upon
the
high
altar
god
himself
invisible
but
ever
present
squalid
dwellings
may
suffice
for
man
but
not
for
the
creator
and
since
god
actually
takes
his
abode
in
such
an
edifice
every
art
must
contribute
to
its
splendor
architects
sculptors
painters
jewelers
all
perform
their
best
each
rendering
his
homage
to
the
eternal
the
cathedral
therefore
sums
up
all
that
is
noblest
in
the
art
of
the
time
when
it
is
erected
illustration
notre
dame
and
the
bishop
palace
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
from
the
restoration
of
hoffbauer
at
the
left
the
and
the
buildings
of
the
archbishop
palace
destroyed
in
the
cathedral
of
which
the
choir
and
the
south
transept
were
finished
only
at
this
date
behind
the
cathedral
on
the
ground
occupied
by
a
public
garden
was
the
church
of
du
pas
built
previous
to
the
cathedral
and
destroyed
in
since
the
nave
of
such
a
church
often
can
be
used
for
secular
mass
meetings
without
fear
of
impiety
and
since
a
whole
countryside
will
claim
the
right
to
throng
the
edifice
on
great
festival
days
a
cathedral
has
to
be
far
larger
than
an
ancient
pagan
temple
it
must
possess
an
interior
meet
for
elaborate
processions
stopping
often
at
each
of
altars
lining
its
walls
to
erect
a
building
like
this
is
an
undertaking
in
which
a
whole
countryside
can
be
asked
to
join
about
forty
years
ago
the
old
cathedral
built
in
the
ancient
romanesque
style
with
a
wooden
roof
was
falling
into
disrepair
and
the
new
pointed
architecture
was
developing
through
all
france
people
from
regions
round
made
remarks
about
the
impiety
of
the
clergy
and
folk
near
pontdebois
in
dishonoring
heaven
various
prelates
taunted
the
ruling
bishop
thibaut
with
his
mean
cathedral
this
thibaut
however
had
been
an
energetic
as
well
as
a
devout
man
by
prudent
administration
of
the
diocese
he
had
saved
considerable
money
he
next
persuaded
his
canons
to
curtail
their
luxuries
and
to
contribute
generously
means
too
were
taken
to
lure
money
from
the
faithful
the
holy
relics
were
exhibited
indulgence
from
purgatory
was
promised
to
donors
barons
were
urged
to
atone
for
their
crimes
by
liberal
gifts
to
the
new
enterprise
civic
pride
and
excited
piety
won
the
deniers
from
the
pontdebois
trade
and
industrial
masters
a
rich
countess
left
a
notable
legacy
on
condition
that
the
canons
should
always
pray
for
her
soul
on
the
anniversary
of
her
death
so
between
coaxing
and
religious
feeling
a
goodly
fund
was
collected
and
as
was
wisely
said
the
new
cathedral
has
saved
many
souls
meaning
that
many
sinful
people
were
happily
moved
to
redeeming
acts
of
generosity
there
were
even
gifts
it
is
said
from
brigands
and
evil
women
likewise
a
good
many
less
debatable
presents
in
kind
as
when
a
baron
gave
both
the
necessary
oak
and
the
pay
of
the
carvers
for
making
the
magnificent
choir
stalls
besides
presenting
the
great
rose
window
whatever
the
source
no
donation
was
denied
the
bishop
counting
it
fortunate
if
even
the
booty
of
thieves
could
be
turned
to
the
glory
of
god
sidenote
building
the
cathedral
bishop
thibaut
found
a
skillful
architect
a
norman
half
cleric
half
layman
who
had
assisted
on
one
of
the
great
churches
at
rouen
the
plans
this
man
drew
up
were
very
elaborate
but
he
did
not
live
to
see
them
more
than
half
executed
even
if
workmen
and
money
failed
not
it
was
dangerous
to
rush
the
erection
of
the
great
piers
buttresses
and
vaulted
ceilings
at
auxerre
where
they
tried
to
hasten
the
work
much
of
the
choir
suddenly
collapsed
like
a
crash
of
thunder
though
heaven
mercifully
prevented
the
loss
of
life
at
noyon
they
began
to
build
in
their
cathedral
was
nearly
finished
by
notre
dame
de
paris
was
begun
in
and
the
choir
was
fairly
completed
by
but
the
great
towers
and
façade
certainly
can
not
be
finished
before
rheims
was
begun
in
but
undoubtedly
even
the
work
on
the
choir
can
not
be
ended
under
thirty
years
from
that
date
if
pontdebois
is
reasonably
complete
after
forty
years
of
effort
it
is
therefore
being
built
more
expeditiously
than
the
average
cathedral
indeed
many
wiseacres
shake
their
heads
too
much
haste
they
mutter
when
one
builds
for
god
and
in
order
to
last
till
his
judgment
day
it
is
very
sinful
to
hurry
first
the
choir
was
finished
with
all
energy
possible
for
here
the
canons
must
constantly
chant
their
offices
the
nave
which
was
more
for
popular
gatherings
waited
till
later
there
was
great
rejoicing
when
at
last
the
main
portal
was
so
far
completed
that
a
very
fine
and
tenderly
carved
statue
of
christ
could
be
set
above
the
same
beautiful
god
the
people
lovingly
call
the
image
and
from
that
time
year
by
year
the
work
went
forward
every
member
or
ornament
that
was
added
seeming
to
suggest
something
additional
as
if
the
achieving
of
perfection
were
to
be
a
work
for
eternity
sidenote
cathedral
a
natural
growth
to
erect
the
main
structure
of
his
cathedral
thibaut
had
called
in
a
traveling
fraternity
of
workmen
the
keepers
of
the
good
god
who
obeyed
the
master
of
the
work
an
architect
they
would
stay
for
years
in
one
place
recruiting
new
members
as
old
ones
died
then
moving
elsewhere
when
no
longer
needed
this
fraternity
erected
the
main
structure
of
the
building
then
thibaut
passed
away
money
failed
and
enthusiasm
somewhat
lapsed
however
twenty
years
later
a
new
fraternity
were
put
to
work
on
the
façade
and
towers
this
was
more
delicate
work
involving
a
great
deal
of
skillful
carving
they
were
obliged
to
stop
again
before
completion
had
been
attained
probably
a
score
of
years
hence
still
another
such
fraternity
will
raise
the
second
tower
meantime
every
year
a
few
skillful
craftsmen
sustained
by
donations
add
a
statue
here
and
a
gargoyle
yonder
put
richly
painted
glass
into
another
window
or
complete
the
intricate
carving
around
the
railing
to
the
pulpit
stairs
now
and
then
there
is
a
special
exhibition
of
relics
to
attract
worshipers
and
their
alms
one
of
the
results
is
that
the
style
of
the
different
parts
of
the
cathedral
differs
subtly
according
to
the
respective
periods
of
their
construction
there
is
not
a
contradiction
but
only
a
pleasing
variety
one
feels
that
cathedral
is
something
it
has
come
into
being
not
by
arbitrary
creation
but
by
a
natural
growth
like
a
mighty
tree

its
vaulted
roof
which
hangs
its
massive
weight
of
stone
so
safely
above
our
heads
all
attempts
at
detailed
description
become
futile
let
them
be
left
for
other
books
and
other
moods
later
generations
doubtless
will
record
at
great
length
that
about
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
a
great
activity
in
church
building
as
a
surpassing
work
of
christian
piety
began
to
manifest
itself
especially
in
northern
france
this
activity
was
not
to
spend
itself
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
it
absorbed
much
of
the
best
thought
and
energy
of
the
time
in
addition
it
developed
a
genuinely
new
type
of
architecture
a
real
innovation
upon
those
models
traceable
back
to
the
pagan
greek
we
come
to
the
reign
of
the
pointed
arch
which
adapts
itself
to
endless
curves
and
varieties
we
have
too
the
grouped
columns
which
uphold
the
groins
of
the
lofty
vaulting
their
members
radiating
outward
like
the
boughs
of
a
stately
forest
these
columns
and
piers
can
be
made
amazingly
light
thanks
to
the
daring
use
of
flying
buttresses
an
invention
not
merely
of
great
utility
but
of
great
beauty
thanks
also
to
these
grouped
pillars
groins
and
buttresses
the
walls
between
the
bays
intervals
between
the
columns
are
in
no
wise
needed
to
uphold
the
roof
of
stone
and
as
a
result
these
bays
can
be
filled
up
with
thin
curtain
walls
crowned
above
with
enormous
windows
which
are
filled
with
a
delicate
tracery
and
a
stained
glass
that
throws
down
upon
the
pavement
of
the
church
all
the
rainbow
tints
of
heaven
each
bay
is
likely
to
contain
a
separate
chapel
or
at
least
an
altar
to
some
particular
saint
over
the
portal
where
the
main
entrance
gives
access
to
the
long
nave
radiates
the
mighty
rose
window
the
final
triumph
of
the
glass
and
tracery
and
so
through
all
the
vast
structure
huge
in
proportions
yet
as
it
were
a
harmonious
mass
of
fair
carving
and
jewel
work
until
even
as
says
holy
writ
the
whole
body
fitly
joined
together
and
compacted
by
that
which
every
joint
supplyeth
according
to
the
effectual
working
in
every
part
maketh
increase
of
the
body
unto
the
edifying
of
itself
in
love
sidenote
magnificent
dimensions
of
cathedrals
so
the
apostle
of
the
making
of
a
christian
man
so
too
of
the
making
of
the
august
church
and
after
saying
this
what
profit
to
add
that
this
cathedral
has
a
length
of
about
four
hundred
feet
that
the
ceiling
of
the
nave
rises
at
least
one
hundred
feet
above
the
pavement
that
the
rose
window
is
nearly
forty
feet
in
diameter
that
the
higher
tower
is
much
more
than
two
hundred
numbers
are
for
sordid
traffic
they
are
not
for
a
work
wrought
out
of
a
passionate
love
of
man
toward
god
we
can
not
stay
to
linger
over
the
symbolism
which
they
tell
us
is
in
every
part
of
the
church
how
the
communion
of
saints
is
proclaimed
by
the
chapels
clustering
around
the
choir
and
nave
how
the
delicate
spire
which
rises
at
the
center
of
the
transepts
teaches
that
vanquishing
earthly
desire
we
should
also
ascend
in
heart
and
mind
how
the
triple
breadth
of
the
nave
and
two
aisles
likewise
the
triple
stretch
of
the
choir
transepts
and
nave
proclaim
the
holy
trinity
and
how
the
serried
armies
of
piers
and
columns
announce
the
prophets
and
apostles
who
uphold
the
fabric
of
the
church
while
font
altar
crucifix
and
crosses
innumerable
attest
the
earthly
pilgrimage
and
redeeming
passion
of
jesus
christ
but
the
cathedral
is
more
than
a
great
collection
of
allegories
everywhere
in
stained
glass
and
still
more
in
the
multitudinous
images
is
told
the
bible
story
the
characters
are
not
clothed
in
hebraic
fashion
baron
abraham
and
sire
david
appear
in
ring
mail
like
doughty
cavaliers
the
history
of
the
good
warrior
judas
maccabæus
perhaps
is
told
in
greater
detail
than
that
of
prophets
like
isaiah
and
jeremiah
but
very
few
important
stories
are
omitted
and
above
all
the
great
pageant
of
the
life
of
jesus
is
worked
out
in
loving
detail
the
child
who
is
brought
time
and
again
to
visit
the
cathedral
knows
almost
every
essential
bible
narrative
albeit
he
may
never
learn
to
read
even
french
much
less
to
con
the
latin
of
the
vulgate
likewise
in
the
cathedral
rest
the
tombs
of
brave
seigneurs
and
worthy
bishops
each
covered
either
with
an
effigy
showing
his
armor
and
his
beloved
hunting
dogs
couched
at
his
feet
or
in
his
pontificals
and
the
tombs
also
of
noble
women
sculptured
as
richly
clad
who
have
made
life
beautiful
by
their
worthy
living
and
who
now
rest
securely
until
great
judgment
so
the
cathedral
is
both
a
temple
for
the
hopes
of
the
present
and
an
inspiration
from
the
remote
and
nearer
past
sidenote
stained

and

after
he
had
prayed
beside
his
father
and
mother
little
anseau
stole
away
from
the
altar
and
wandered
timidly
about
the
church
in
a
corner
of
a
transept
he
found
a
stone
craftsman
completing
a
small
image
of
elizabeth
to
adorn
some
niche
the
sculptor
was
polishing
the
back
of
the
statue
no
less
carefully
than
the
front
why
such
trouble
asked
the
boy
curiously
no
one
can

my

smiling
no

money

the
mechanic
bustle
of
pontdebois
baron
conon
and
his
company
rode
back
to
aliquis
after
they
had
traveled
for
miles
the
great
mass
of
the
cathedral
was
still
visible
behind
them
the
feudal
age
has
produced
very
much
that
is
evil
it
has
also
produced
the
gothic
church
and
its
builders
by
which
ought
the
epoch
be
judged
seven
hundred
years
afterward
the
donjon
of
aliquis
is
an
ruin
vanished
is

vanished

footnotes
few
or
no
cathedrals
were
completed
at
any
time
in
the
sense
that
all
the
details
of
their
design
were
brought
to
perfection
for
example
notre
dame
de
paris
covered
four
times
the
floor
area
of
the
parthenon
at
athens
a
decidedly
large
greek
temple
with
its
nave
thrice
as
high
as
the
older
building
of
course
a
greek
temple
was
primarily
for
housing
a
holy
image
the
great
sacrifices
and
the
throng
of
worshippers
would
be
outside
the
edifice
in
the
open
unlike
a
christian
church
one
device
was
to
take
an
relic
and
intrust
it
to
monks
who
would
place
it
in
a
cart
and
drive
through
a
wide
region
haranguing
the
faithful
and
holding
out
a
purse
for
them
to
fill
at
rouen
one
of
the
cathedral
towers
was
known
as
the
butter
tower
because
it
was
largely
built
with
money
given
for
permission
to
eat
butter
in
lent
at
rheims
prior
to
the
german
bombardment
of
there
were
more
than
two
thousand
statues
during
this
period
there
were
built
in
france
some
eighty
cathedrals
and
more
than
five
hundred
large
and
superior
churches
in
this
gothic
style
such
figures
would
indicate
that
pontdebois
cathedral
was
somewhat
smaller
than
notre
dame
de
paris
it
could
rank
up
well
among
the
great
churches
of
france
yet
not
at
all
in
the
first
class
john
of
damascus
writing
in
the
orient
in

eighth
century
gave
what
amounted
to
the
standard
justification

i

i

the
