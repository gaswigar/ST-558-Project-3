something
for
humanity
may
be
fine
for
humanity
but
rough
on
the
individual
he
had
quite
a
on
him
for
a
kid
i
thought
at
first
but
when
he
moved
closer
to
the
light
by
the
cash
register
to
ask
the
bartender
for
a
match
or
something
i
saw
it
was
that
not
just
the
nose
broken
veins
on
his
cheeks
too
and
the
funny
eyes
he
must
have
seen
me
look
because
he
slid
back
away
from
the
light
the
bartender
shook
my
bottle
of
ale
in
front
of
me
like
a
swiss
so
it
foamed
inside
the
green
glass
you
ready
for
another
sir
he
asked
i
shook
my
head
down
the
bar
he
tried
it
on
the
kid
he
was
drinking
scotch
and
water
or
something
like
that
and
found
out
he
could
push
him
around
he
sold
him
three
scotch
and
waters
in
ten
minutes
when
he
tried
for
number
four
the
kid
had
his
courage
up
and
said
i
tell
when
i
ready
for
another
jack
but
there
was
any
trouble
it
was
almost
nine
and
the
place
began
to
fill
up
the
manager
a
real
hood
type
stationed
himself
by
the
door
to
screen
out
the
kids
and
give
the
big
hello
to
conventioneers
the
girls
came
hurrying
in
too
with
their
little
makeup
cases
and
their
fancy
hair
piled
up
and
their
frozen
faces
with
the
perfect
mouths
drawn
on
them
one
of
them
stopped
to
say
something
to
the
manager
some
excuse
about
something
and
he
said
that
aw
ri
get
inna
dressing
room
a
band
behind
the
drapes
at
the
back
of
the
stage
began
to
make
noises
and
there
were
two
bartenders
keeping
busy
mostly
it
was
beer
a
midweek
crowd
i
finished
my
ale
and
had
to
wait
a
couple
of
minutes
before
i
could
get
another
bottle
the
bar
filled
up
from
the
end
near
the
stage
because
all
the
customers
wanted
a
good
close
look
at
the
strippers
for
their
bottles
of
beer
but
i
noticed
that
nobody
sat
down
next
to
the
kid
or
if
anybody
did
he
did
stay
long
you
go
out
for
some
fun
and
the
bartender
pushes
you
around
and
nobody
wants
to
sit
next
to
you
i
picked
up
my
bottle
and
glass
and
went
down
on
the
stool
to
his
left
he
turned
to
me
right
away
and
said
what
kind
of
a
place
is
this
anyway
the
broken
veins
were
all
over
his
face
little
ones
but
so
many
so
close
that
they
made
his
face
look
something
like
marbled
rubber
the
funny
look
in
his
eyes
was
it
the
trick
contact
lenses
but
i
tried
not
to
stare
and
not
to
look
away
it
okay
i
said
it
a
good
show
if
you
do
mind
a
lot
of
noise
from
he
stuck
a
cigarette
into
his
mouth
and
poked
the
pack
at
me
i
a
spacer
he
said
interrupting
i
took
one
of
his
cigarettes
and
said
oh
he
snapped
a
lighter
for
the
cigarettes
and
said
venus
i
was
noticing
that
his
pack
of
cigarettes
on
the
bar
had
some
kind
of
yellow
sticker
instead
of
the
blue
tax
stamp
ai
that
a
crock
he
asked
you
ca
smoke
and
they
give
you
lighters
for
a
souvenir
but
it
a
good
lighter
on
mars
last
week
they
gave
us
all
some
cheap
sets
you
get
something
every
trip
hah
i
took
a
good
long
drink
of
ale
and
he
finished
his
scotch
and
water
shoot
you
call
a
trip
a
one
of
the
girls
was
working
her
way
down
the
bar
she
was
going
to
slide
onto
the
empty
stool
at
his
right
and
give
him
the
business
but
she
looked
at
him
first
and
decided
not
to
she
curled
around
me
and
asked
if
i
buy
her
a
ole
drink
i
said
no
and
she
moved
on
to
the
next
i
could
kind
of
feel
the
young
fellow
quivering
when
i
looked
at
him
he
stood
up
i
followed
him
out
of
the
dump
the
manager
grinned
without
thinking
and
said
boys
to
us
the
kid
stopped
in
the
street
and
said
to
me
you
do
have
to
follow
me
around
pappy
he
sounded
like
one
wrong
word
and
i
would
get
socked
in
the
teeth
take
it
easy
i
know
a
place
where
they
wo
spit
in
your
eye
he
pulled
himself
together
and
made
a
joke
of
it
this
i
have
to
see
he
said
near
here
a
few
blocks
we
started
walking
it
was
a
nice
night
i
do
know
this
city
at
all
he
said
i
from
covington
kentucky
you
do
your
drinking
at
home
there
we
do
have
places
like
this
he
meant
the
whole
skid
row
area
it
not
so
bad
i
said
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
here
is
that
a
fact
i
mean
down
home
a
man
your
age
would
likely
have
a
wife
and
children
i
do
the
hell
with
them
he
laughed
like
a
real
youngster
and
i
figured
he
could
even
be
he
did
have
any
trouble
with
the
broken
curbstones
in
spite
of
his
scotch
and
waters
i
asked
him
about
it
sense
of
balance
he
said
you
have
to
be
tops
for
balance
to
be
a
spacer
you
spend
so
much
time
outside
in
a
suit
people
do
know
how
much
punctures
and
you
are
worth
a
damn
if
you
lose
your
point
what
that
mean
oh
well
it
hard
to
describe
when
you
outside
and
you
lose
your
point
it
means
you
all
mixed
up
you
do
know
which
way
the
can
that
the
ship
which
way
the
can
is
it
having
all
that
room
around
you
but
if
you
have
a
good
balance
you
feel
a
little
tugging
to
the
ship
or
maybe
you
just
which
way
the
ship
is
without
feeling
it
then
you
have
your
point
and
you
can
get
the
work
done
there
must
be
a
lot
that
hard
to
describe
he
thought
that
might
be
a
crack
and
he
clammed
up
on
me
you
call
this
gandytown
i
said
after
a
while
it
where
the
old
railroad
men
hang
out
this
is
the
place
it
was
the
second
week
of
the
month
before

oswiak

jumping
the
grandsons
of
the
pioneers
were
on
the
juke
singing
the
from
mars
and
old
paddy
shea
was
jigging
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
had
a
full
seidel
of
beer
in
his
right
hand
and
his
empty
left
sleeve
was
flapping
the
kid
balked
at
the
screen
door
too
damn
bright
he
said
i
shrugged
and
went
on
in
and
he
followed
we
sat
down
at
a
table
at
oswiak
you
can
drink
at
the
bar
if
you
want
to
but
none
of
the
regulars
do
paddy
jigged
over
and
said

home
doc
he
a
liverpool
irishman
they
talk
like

but
they
sound
almost
like

to
me
hello

i
brought
somebody
uglier
than
you
now
what
do
you
say
paddy
jigged
around
the
kid
in
a
with
his
sleeve
flapping
and
then
flopped
into
a
chair
when
the
record
stopped
he
took
a
big
drink
from
the
seidel
and
said
can
he
do
this
paddy
stretched
his
face
into
an
awful
grin
that
showed
his
teeth
he
has
three
of
them
the
kid
laughed
and
asked
me
what
the
hell
did
you
drag
me
into
here

house
the
day

oswiak
wife
waddled
over
for
the
order
and
the
kid
asked
us
what
have
i
figured
i
could
start
drinking
so
it
was
three
double
scotches
after
the
second
round
paddy
started
blowing
about
how
they
took
his
arm
off
without
any
anesthetics
except
a
bottle
of
gin
because
the
freight
he
was
tangled
up
in
could
wait
that
brought
some
of
the
other
old
gimps
over
to
the
table
with
their
stories
blackie
bauer
had
been
sitting
in
a
boxcar
with
his
legs
sticking
through
the
door
when
the
train
started
with
a
jerk
wham
the
door
closed
everybody
laughed
at
blackie
for
being
that
dumb
in
the
first
place
and
he
got
mad
sam
fireman
has
palsy
this
week
he
was
claiming
he
used
to
be
a
watchmaker
before
he
began
to
shake
the
week
before
he
said
he
was
a
brain
surgeon
a
woman
i
did
know
a
real
old
boxcar
bertha
dragged
herself
over
and
began
some
kind
of
story
about
how
her
sister
married
a
greek
but
she
passed
out
before
we
found
out
what
happened
somebody
wanted
to
know
what
was
wrong
with
the
kid
face
bauer
i
think
it
was
after
he
came
back
to
the
table
compression
and
decompression
the
kid
said

but
i
kicked
him
under
the
table
we
sang
for
a
while
and
then
we
told
gags
and
recited
limericks
for
a
while
and
i
noticed
that
the
kid
and
maggie
had
wandered
into
the
back
room
the
one
with
the
latch
on
the
door
oswiak

hell
they

it
serves
right
i

double
scotch
and
added
twenty
years
of
it
and
they
found
out
a
few
things
they
did
know
redlines
are
only
one
of
them
twenty
years
more
maybe
they
find
out
a
few
more
things
they
did
know
maybe
by
the
time
there
a
bathtub
in
every
american
home
and
an
alcoholism
clinic
in
every
american
town
they
find
out
a
whole
of

a
wreck
like
our
friend
here
from
riding
the
bowman
drive
it
the
damn
govermint
sam
fireman
repeated
and
what
the
hell
did
you
mean
by
that
remark
about
alcoholism
paddy
said
real
sore
personally
i
can
take
it
or
leave
it
alone
so
we
got
to
talking
about
that
and
everybody
there
turned
out
to
be
people
who
could
take
it
or
leave
it
alone
it
was
maybe
midnight
when
the
kid
showed
at
the
table
again
looking
kind
of
dazed
i
was
drunker
than
i
ought
to
be
by
midnight
so
i
said
i
was
going
for
a
walk
he
tagged
along
and
we
wound
up
on
a
bench
at
screwball
square
the
were
still
going
strong
like
i
said
it
was
a
nice
night
after
a
while
a
old
auntie
who
give
a
damn
about
the
face
sat
down
and
tried
to
talk
the
kid
into
going
to
see
some
etchings
the
kid
did
get
it
and
i
led
him
over
to
hear
the
before
there
was
trouble
one
of
the
orators
was
a
evangelist
and
oh
my
friends
he
said
when
i
looked
through
the
porthole
of
the
spaceship
and
beheld
the
wonder
of
the
firmament
you
a
stinkin
yankee
liar
the
kid
yelled
at
him
you
say
one
damn
more
word
about
and
i
ram
your
spaceship
down
your
lyin
throat
wheah
your
redlines
if
you
such
a
hot
spacer
the
crowd
did
know
what
he
was
talking
about
but
wheah
your
redlines
sounded
good
to
them
so
they
heckled
off
his
box
with
it
i
got
the
kid
to
a
bench
the
liquor
was
working
in
him
all
of
a
sudden
he
simmered
down
after
a
while
and
asked
doc

given
miz
rorty
some
money
i
asked
her
afterward
and
she
said
she
admire
to
have
something
to
remember
me
by
so
i
gave
her
my
lighter
she
seem
to
be
real
pleased
with
it
but
i
was
wondering
if
maybe
i
embarrassed
her
by
asking
her
right
out
like

covington
kentucky

i
walked
him
to
the
avenue
and
waited
for
a
fleet
cab
it

almost
five
minutes
the
independents
that
roll
drunks

in
the
y
hotel
i
told

him
in
when

when
i
walked
through
screwball
square
again
some
college
kids
were
yelling
wheah

old
charlie
the
last
of
the
wobblies
old
charlie

hell
with
your
breadlines
i
talking
about
atomic
bombs
up
there
and
he
pointed
at
the
moon
it
was
a
nice
night
but
the
liquor
was
dying
in
me
there
was
a
joint
around
the
corner
so
i
went
in
and
had
a
drink

me
to
the
club

had
a
bottle
there
i
got
into
the
first

he
gave
me
a
big
personality
smile
i
did
say
anything
and
he
started
the
car
he
was
right
of
course
i
was
in
everybody
doghouse
some
day
scare
hell
out
