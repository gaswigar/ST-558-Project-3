teetered
on

before

a

mannerism
unchanged
by
eleven
years
in
the
wilderness
of

he
pinched
and
pulled
the
skin
on
his
adam
apple
his
head
jutting
forward
with
an
awkwardness
not
aggressive
but
intent
paul

thought

never

bracketed

corners
on

now
paul

was
troubled
by

familiar
thought
jensen
should
not
have
it
has
to
be
the

somewhat

out
nearly
the

as
on

no

some
pretty
high

unlimited
forest
prairie
desert
he
closed
bloodshot
eyes
pressing
the
lids
paul
mason
thought
should
never
try
to
paint
ed
the
portrait
would
always
come
out
as
hercules
frustrated
and
he
would
care
for
it
spearman
said
even
most
of
the
tallest
mountains
look
smooth
old
if
there
were
glaciers
it
was
a
long
time
ago
geologically
a
quiet
phase
sears
oliphant
remarked
as
earth
looked
in
the
jurassic
and
may
look
again
born
fifty
years
ago
in
tel
aviv
brought
up
in
london
rio
and
new
york
because
his
parents
were
medical
trouble
shooters
for
the
federation
and
possessed
of
a
doctorate
in
biology
more
exactly
taxonomy
from
johns
hopkins
sears
oliphant
claimed
that
his
original
polish
name
could
not
have
been
spelled
with
the
aid
of
two
dictionaries
and
a
crowbar
his
fat
face
blinked
at
dorothy
with
little
kind
eyes
i
forget
sugar
you
were
around
in
the
jurassic
were
you
maybe
her
slow
smile
was
for
paul
as
a
very
early
mammal
wright
said
no
artifacts
at
first
it
looked
like
venus
his
crinkled
asymmetrical
face
probed
at
them
with
a
wistful
half
smile
like
a
child
may
we
call
this
planet
lucifer
son
of
the
morning
and
if
we
land
and
found
a
city
or
am
i
being
ridiculous
let
it
be
jensen
city
in
honor
of
a
myth
shading
closed
lids
spearman
said
with
harshness
myth
why
ed
yes
like
all
remembered
heroes
who
continue
in
the
love
of
others
a
love
that
magnifies
how
else
would
you
have
it
but
ann
bryan
was
troubled
lucifer
my
dear
lucifer
was
an
angel
devils
and
angels
have
a
way
of
turning
out
to
be
the
same
organism
i
noticed
that
first
when
i
was
a
damned
interne
i
noticed
it
again
when
i
switched
to
anthropology
i
even
noticed
it
on
a
space
ship
with
the
five
persons
i
love
best
no
artifacts
huh
dorothy
said
you
have
seen
these
latest
pictures
doc
something
wright
hurried
over
gray
eyes
wide
and
sparkling
quit
hoping
ann
joined
him
in
her
slimness
too
taut
wright
slipped
an
elderly
arm
around
her
parallel
lines
in
jungle
ah
now
why
none
in
the
open
ground
spearman
suggested
we
could
take
more
shots
but
paul
mason
broke
the
darkening
silence
but
what
ed
we
falling
some
i
could
move
us
out
into
a
orbit
by
using
more
of
the
reaction
mass
we
have
none
to
waste
death
eleven
years
ago
spearman
shook
his
gaunt
but
heavy
head
thirty
accelerations
and
the
rest
periods
they
allowed
us
were
insufficient
i
think
you
remember
what
wrecks
we
were
when
it
was
finished
that
why
i
tried
to
allow
more
time
in
deceleration
his
brassy
voice
slowed
fetching
out
words
with
care
the
last
acceleration
as
you
know
was
not
jensen
was
already
dead
must
have
been
heart
when
his
hand
took
us
out
of
automatic
made
another
acceleration
that
damn
near
flattened
us
still
here
though
sears
oliphant
chuckled
and
patted
his
middle
we
made
it
did
we
boy
it
sounded
a
little
forced
in
deceleration
i
had
to
allow
for
the
big
step
jensen
never
meant
more
of
the
mass
was
used
to
correct
a
deflection
same
allowance
must
be
made
in
returning
not
to
mention
the
biggest
drain
of
all
getting
out
of
gravity
here
a
problem
not
present
at
the
spaceport
oh
planned
for
she
built
to
do
it
even
from
a
heavier
planet
than
this
but
after
she
done
it
the
margin
for
return
will
be
narrower
than
i
care
to
think
dorothy
small
and
soft
leaned
back
in
paul
arms
her
even
voice
was
for
everyone
in
the
control
room
nevertheless
we
go
down
spearman
gazed
across
at
her
without
apparent
comprehension
he
went
on
deliberate
harassed
here
a
thing
i
never
told
you
in
that
accidental
acceleration
the
ship
did
not
respond
normally
the
deflection
happened
then
and
it
may
have
been
due
to
a
defect
in
the
building
of
a
fault
in
the
tail
jets
at
the
time
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
reach
jensen
before
i
blacked
out
i
still
do
know
how
i
ever
managed
it
later
i
tried
to
think
there
could
be
no
defect
the
forward
jets
took
care
of
us
nicely
in
deceleration
until
we
start
braking
we
ca
know
indicators
everything
all
right
down
there
instruments
can
lie
lord
they
sweated
out
atomic
motors
since
before
almost
a
century
now
and
we
still
kids
playing
with
toys
sears
smiled
into
plump
hands
so
i
must
be
sure
to
pack
my
microscope
in
one
of
the
lifeboats
hey
you
for
landing
then
sears
nodded
ann
bryan
thrust
thin
ivory
fingers
into
her
loose
black
hair
could
take
another
eleven
years
she
attempted
a
smile
tell
me
somebody
tell
me
there
be
music
on
lucifer
a
way
to
make
new
strings
for
my
violin
before
i
forget
everything
dorothy
said
land
gently
as
one
might
say
time
for
lunch
and
she
added
we
find
strings
nan
land
of
course
said
christopher
wright
preoccupied
his
long
finger
tapped
on
the
photograph
his
lips
went
on
moving
silently
carrying
through
some
private
meditation

paul
mason
said
anyone
suppose
the
first
interstellar
would
just
turn
around
and
go
home
we
here
are
we
through
hours
when
spoken
words
were
few
inner
words
riotous
lucifer
turned
an
evening
face
a
morning
descent
might
have
been
pleasanter
in
human
terms
but
the
calculator
churning
its
mathematical
brew
said
the
time
was
now
paul
mason
squirmed
into
his
pilot
seat
it
was
good
he
thought
that
they
could
at
least
meet
the
challenge
of
the
unexplored
with
adequate
bodies
wright
was
dryly
indestructible
ed
spearman
a
gaunt
monolith
the
plumpness
of
sears
oliphant
had
nothing
flabby
the
women
were
in
the
warm
vigor
of
a
youth
that
had
never
known
illness
as
for
his
own
body
paul
felt
for
it
now
a
twinge
of
amused
admiration
as
if
he
were
seeing
an
animated
statue
by
an
artist
better
than
himself
slender
tough
nothing
too
much
built
for
endurance
and
speed
it
would
serve
spearman
was
already
talking
in
the
earphones
close

paul
responded
from
ingrained
training
beyond
the
window
that
would
give
him
forward
vision
in
the
impossible
event
he
had
to
fly
the
lifeboat
the
heavens
opened
withdrawal
of
the
shield
into
the
belly
of
the
mother
ship
was
a
dream
motion
within
a
wider
dream
dorothy
and

were
strapped
in
the
two
seats
behind

paul
considered
he
had
had
a
thousand
hours
of
atmospheric

two
years
drill
on
these
boats

could
worry
less

beautiful

lying
eleven
years
secret
but
alert
in
the
streamlined
blisters
powered
by
charlesite
to
avoid
the
ponderous
shielding
still
necessary
for
atomic
motors
and
charlesite
perfected
only
thirty
years
ago
in
was
obedient
stuff
in
space
the
boats
were
small
rocket
ships
in
atmosphere
gliders
or
jet
planes
while
had
been
in
the
long
ordeal
of
building
paul
had
been
shot
from
gleaming
tubes
like
this
into
the
atmosphere
of
earth
the
blind
depth
at
the
spaceport
the
desolate
thin
air
of
mars
spearman
said
turning
in
five
minutes
in
the
port
lifeboat
ann
and
sears
would
be
waiting
but
that
lock
would
be
open
for

must
be
in
the

room
if
they
had
to
abandon

ridiculous
ed

be
many
moments
behind

moved
paul
check
straps
over
paul
glanced
behind
him
all
set
over
the
forward
jets
spoke
once
and
softly
spearman
said
out
of
orbit
we
start
braking
sooner
than
you
think
then
we
know
the
depth
of
quiet
was
a
depth
of
eternity
time
to
reflect
to
marvel
if
you
wished
one
hundred
and
eleven
years
since
hiroshima
which
the
inveterate
insanity
of
history
textbooks
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
great
experiment
years
since
the
spaceport
seventy
since
the
founding
of
stations
on
luna
and
mars
but
to
paul
mason
a
greater
marvel
was
the
responding
warmth
of
the
woman
the
brooding
charity
of
the
old
man
whose
lives
were
upheld
with
him
in
this
silent
nothing
dependent
on
the
magic
bundle
of
muscle
and
nerve
that
was
himself
is
love
the
greater
spaceport
had
been
twelve
years
in
building
then
more
than
a
century
from
early
rocket
experiments
to
the
factories
turning
out
charlesite
in
that
century
man
had
even
added
to
his
morsels
of
a
trifle
more
than
he
possessed
in
the
days
of
flint
ax
and
reeking
cave
we
are
in
atmosphere
said
the
earphones
a
cerebral
invention
how
long
is
a
may
life
to
a
may
fly
braking
starts
in
seconds
warn
the
others
paul
shoved
down
the
mouthpiece
echoing
the
message
wright
said
six
people
the
arrogance
of
man
doing
fine
paul
pressure
not
too
bad
a
long
roaring
but
then
the
stars
the
stars
went
mad
a
glare
a
cruel
second
of
the
light
of
the
star
that
was
now
the
sun
and
a
flicker
of
not
real
the
roaring
paused
stopped
the
earphones
screamed
release
off
releasing
the
amused
voice
was
paul
own
good
luck
ed
no
answer
there
was
still
such
a
thing
as
time
look
the
federation
was
a
grand
thing
potentially
if
only
as
doc
insists
it
were
for
the
damned
cultural
lag
of
the
humanistic
sciences
but
there
is
unfortunately
no
time
to
turn
around
and
see
if
that
little
brown
cowlick
is
over
her
forehead
the
way
meantime
he
said
aloud
doc
dorothy
get
ready
for
a
big
one
and
his
hand
pulled
for
release
nicely
as
you
might
steer
a
road
car
for
a
turn
the
pressure
torment
finished
he
looked
at
a
friendly
green
eye
so
the
retractile
wings
were
as
good
as
eleven
years
ago
you
hoped
atmosphere
thin
said
the
gauge
never
mind
thicker
soon
down
you
steep
level
off
if
there
stuff
to
bite
on
there
is
thank
you
machine
age
man
for
a
sweet
boat
that
thing
gibbering
in
the
autonomic
and
voluntary
nervous
systems
merely
fear
overlook
it
the
ship
was
alien
far
away
turning
bright
and
deliberate
like
a
mirror
dropped
in
a
well
the
other
lifeboat
but
ed
would
have
to
reach
it
close
lock
strap
in
open
shield
while
the
ship
went
down
lately
an
artificiality
now
the
plainest
word
in
the
language
a
gleaming
disturbance
in
the
air
down
yonder
something
streaking
away
from
the
dot
that
was
a
dying
ship
ed
can
you
hear
me
over
yes
said
the
voice
in
the
earphones
paul
noticed
himself
weeping
they
made
it
they
made
it
the
voice
said
coldly
quiet
your
altitude
over
thousand
all
under
control
over
jerk
i
going
to
head
for
can
you
see
the
ship
it
was
possible
to
find
the
silver
dot
of
above
an
expanse
of
blue
the
blue
paul
understood
was
not
becoming
larger
simply
nearer
the
dot
changed
to
a
white
flower
which
swelled
and
hung
tranquilly
over
the
blue
a
brief
memorial
the
radio
carried
a
groan
and
then
better
maybe
the
lake
may
be
shallow
enough
for
salvage
if
it
hit
ground
there
be
nothing
at
all
get
nearer
paul
keep
me
in
sight
not
too
damn
near
time
delicately
paul
asked
the
boat
for
a
steeper
glide
the
response
was
even
was
it
some
peevish
sound
he
flattened
the
glide
a
thousand
feet
above
ed
boat
the
below
anything
real
about
it
yes
if
time
was
real
but
one
had
to
think
that
over
mild
hills
of
dark
in
the
west
yes
because
now
there
was
a
birth
of
sunset
beyond
them
lighter
green
below
alongside
the
lake
that
would
be
meadow
not
one
of
the
great
lakes
no
larger
than
lake
champlain
its
outlet
in
the
south
blurred
by
marsh
only
a
portion
of
its
northwest
shore
adjoined
the
meadow
except
in
that
region
the
lake
was
a
blue
s
written
on
dark
of
jungle
a
winged
brown
thing
slipped
by
teasing
the
edge
of
vision
bird
or
something
in
the
earphones
was
a
dazed
note
like
shame
power
was
out
of
control
paul
port
motor
had
to
be
a
defect
in
the
building
something
that
could
take
the
strain
of
what
happened
eleven
years
ago
all
the
way
god
and
then
to
be
loused
up
by
a
builder
error
to
spearman
paul
knew
a
mechanical
defect
was
the
gravest
of
indecencies
beyond
any
forgiveness
true
sunset
here
a
world
and
you
do
climb
out
of
gravity
on
charlesite
paul
said
doc
parallel
lines
i
think
but
the
speed
of
the
glide
allowed
no
certainty
only
a
glimpse
of
three
dark
bars
perhaps
half
a
mile
long
in
the
jungle
area
northwest
of
the
meadow
and
a
hint
of
other
groups
further
north
they
be
there
according
to
a
map
spearman
had
made
in
orbit
from
the
final
photographs
and
some
fifty
miles
south
of
here
was
a
great
network
of
them
thirty
miles
long
the
glide
brought
them
out
over
meadow
once
more
a
thing
was
riding
with
them
a
grumbling
moan
paul
told
himself
model
it
can
not
happen
it
can
not
dorothy
dorothy
cried
specks
in
the
open
ground
moving
hundreds
of
oh
look
paul
campfires
how
high
are
we
under
seven
thousand
check
your
compass
by
the
sunset
doc
see
if
we
have
a
magnetic
north
we
do
spearman
voice
said
life
all
right
i
ca
make
out
paul
cut
in
with
hurried
precision
ed
vibration
port
wing
bad
i
going
to
make
one
more
circle
over
the
woods
if
i
can
and
try
for
the
north
end
of
this
meadow
a
startled
croak
i
jet
off
give
you
room
paul
saw
the
squirt
of
green
flame
ed
boat
darted
westward
like
a
squeezed
apple
seed
paul
dipped
and
leveled
off
as
much
as
he
dared
we
all
right
he
lived
with
it
a
timeless
time
knowing
it
would
happen
they
were
circling
over
jungle
pointed
into
sunset
the
jet
would
only
make
matters
worse
rip
the
heart
out
soon
the
meadow
would
come
around
again
but
the
moment
was
now
an
end
of
the
moaning
vibration
a
lurch
paul
hand
leaped
stupidly
for
the
charlesite
ignition
and
checked
itself
calm
but
for
the
reeling
of
sunset
must
tell
dorothy
not
to
fight
the
straps
is
solid
is
solid
then
the
smash
the
tearing
and
grinding
somehow
no
death
sky
in
the
window
changed
to
a
gloom
of
purple
and
green
no
death
elastic
branches
metal
whimpered
and
shrieked
that
us
they
built
them
solid
there
was
settling
into
silence
the
pressure
on
paul
cheek
he
knew
was
the
wonderfully
living
pressure
of
dorothy
hand
because
it
moved
it
pinched
his
ear
it
groped
for
his
mouth
a
hiss
through
the
wrenched
seams
the
old
air
of
earth
yielded
to
the
stronger
weight
of
lucifer
the
starboard
wing
parted
with
a
squeal
like
amusement
letting
the
boat
body
rest
evenly
on
the
ground
and
christopher
wright
said
amen
the
earphones
were
squawking
speak
up
can
you
hear
me
can
you
not
hurt
seams
open
and
there
goes
sears
test
for
bacteria
down
and
safe
ed
listen
in
relief
ed
spearman
was
heavily
didactic
again
you
are
three
quarters
of
a
mile
inside
the
jungle
i
will
land
near
the
woods
it
will
be
dark
in
about
an
hour
wait
there
until
we
one
minute
paul
said
in
sudden
exhaustion
we
can
find
you
easier
sears
test
is
important
we
already
exposed
to
the
air
but
what
ca
hear
damn
it
the
voice
dimmed
and
crackled
stay
sealed
up
nothing
can
you
hear
nothing
oh
well
good
said
paul
discarding
the
headset
adding
foolishly
i
tired
dorothy
unfastened
his
straps
her
kiss
was
warm
and
quick
radio
kaput
huh
wright
flexed
lean
cautious
legs
pity
i
did
want
to
tell
sears
one
i
just
remembered
after
eleven
years
about
poor
lackadaisical
lou
who
painted
her
torso
bright
blue
not
for
love
not
for
money
not
because
it
looked
funny
but
simply
for
something
to
do
you
not
hurt
doc
dorothy
said
not
where
it
counts
ca
kill
an
anthropologist
ask
my
student
paul
mason
leather
hides
pickled
in
a
solution
ten
parts
curiosity
to
one
of
statistics
doctors
are
mighty
viable
too
ask
my
student
dorothy
leeds
paul
forehead
was
wet
dark
in
an
hour
he
reminded
me
how
close
are
we
to
the
nearest
of
those
parallel
lines
three
or
four
miles
doc
at
a
loose
guess
remember
that
great
mess
of
fifty
or
sixty
miles
south
of
here
shows
on
ed
map
we
must
be
mm
seventy
miles
from
the
smallest
of
the
two
oceans
oh
let
call
it
the
atlantic
huh
and
the
other
one
the
east
atlantic
anyway
the
ocean
beyond
that
range
of
hills
we
saw
on
the
way
down
i
saw
campfires
in
the
meadow
dorothy
said
things
running
i
thought
so
too
paul
i
wonder
if
sears
can
do
any
testing
of
the
air
from
the
lifeboat
some
of
the
equipment
could
be
transferred
from
and
how
could
they
communicate
with
us
they
have
to
breathe
it
soon
in
any
case
paul
checked
a
shuddering
yawn
i
must
have
been
thinking
in
terms
of
which
is
history
you
know
i
believe
the
artificial
gravity
was
stronger
than
we
thought
i
feel
light
not
heavy
high
oxygen
dorothy
suggested
hot
too
crash
suits
ca
do
us
any
more
good
they
struggled
out
of
them
in
the
cramped
space
down
to
faded
jackets
and
shorts
wright
brooded
on
it
pinching
his
throat
only
advantage
in
the
others
staying
sealed
up
a
while
is
that
if
we
get
sick
they
get
sick
a
bit
later
could
be
some
advantage
paul
think
we
should
try
to
reach
them
this
evening
three
quarters
of
a
mile
dark
coming
on
no
but
so
far
as
concerned
doc
you
boss
of
this
expedition
in
the
ship
ed
had
to
be
matter
of
engineering
knowledge
no
longer
applies
i
wanted
to
say
that
wright
turned
away
dorothy
she
said
warmly
yes
you
i
oh
my
dear
i
do
know
that
it
best
fretfully
he
added
should
need
a
leader
only
six
of
us
agreement
dorothy
held
her
voice
to
lightness
i
can
even
disagree
with
myself
sears
will
want
you
to
take
over
ann
too
probably
his
gray
head
sank
in
his
hands
as
for
that
he
said
inside
of
me
i
apt
to
be
a
committee
of
fifteen
paul
thought
he
not
old
when
did
he
turn
gray
and
we
never
noticing
it
for
now
wright
said
let
not
be
official
about
it
huh
what
if
my
dreams
for
lucifer
are
not
shared
dreams
are
never
quite
shared
dorothy
said
i
want
you
to
lead
us
wright
whispered
with
difficulty
i
will
try
dorothy
continued
ed
may
want
things
black
and
white
not
ann
i
think
she
hates
discussions
being
obliged
to
make
up
her
mind
you
elected
soldier
can
you
open
the
door
paul
it
jammed
in
the
spoiled
frame
after
opening
enough
for
a
tight
exit
wright
stared
into
evening
not
the
leader
kind
academic
his
white
hands
moved
in
doubtful
protest
hate
snap
decisions
we
be
forced
to
make
a
lot
of
them
paul
said
they
best
made
by
one
who
hates
making
them
the
lean
face
became
gentle
taught
you
that
myself
did
i
son
well
inventory
what
we
got
right
here
thirty
days
rations
for
three
packed
eleven
years
ago
two
automatic
rifles
one
shotgun
three
automatic
pistols
three
hundred
rounds
for
each
weapon
should
have
transferred
more
from
the
ship
but
we
did
three
hunting
knives
very
good
they
at
least
wo
give
out
with
care
right
two
sealed
cases
of
garden
seeds
anybody
guess
about
them
six
sets
of
overalls
shorts
and
jackets
three
pairs
of
shoes
apiece
the
federation
allowed
that
you
and
ann
might
grow
a
little
dot
plasta
soles
and
uppers
should
last
several
years
carpentry
tools
ed
boat
has
the
garden
tools
instead
sears
did
pack
his
microscope
did
he
oh
my
yes
said
dorothy
in
affectionate
mimicry
of
the
fat
turn
of
speech
each
crash
suit
has
kit
radion
flashlight
good
for
two
years
maybe
compass
field
glasses
plus
whatever
else
we
had
sense
enough
to
stuff
in
set
of
technical
manuals
mostly
useless
without
the
ship
but
i
think
there
one
on
woodcraft
primitive
tools
and
weapons
survival
stuff
oh
the
books
wright
clutched
his
hair
groaning
the
books
just
that
woodcraft
no
no
no
the
books
on
everything
the
library
i
only
just
understood
that
it
gone
the
whole
flowering
of
human
thought
man
best
uncorrupted
ann
music
the
art
volumes
you
selected
paul
and
your
own
sketches
and
paintings
no
loss
there
do
talk
like
a
damn
fool
shakespeare
dorothy
twisted
in
the
narrowness
to
put
both
arms
around
him
doc
quiet
dear
please
i
can
remember
pages
of
few
dorothy
was
wiping
his
face
with
a
loose
comer
of
her
jacket
doc
subside
please
now
make
it
stop
hurting
inside
yourself
oh
quiet
after
a
time
he
said
lifelessly
go
on
with
the
inventory
paul
well
there
a
duplicate
of
that
map
ed
made
yesterday
from
orbit
photographs
of
this
area
about
a
hundred
miles
square
we
near
the
eastern
edge
of
that
square
there
the
other
map
he
made
of
the
whole
globe
we
did
duplicate
that
one
i
guess
that
about
it
knives
wright
muttered
knives
and
a
few
tools
the
firearms
may
make
a
difference
while
they
last
yes
perhaps
but
thirty
years
from
now
thirty
years
from
now
said
dorothy
still
sheltering
his
head
thirty
years
from
now
our
children
will
be
grown
oh
wright
groped
for
her
fingers
you
almost
wanted
it
like
this
did
you
i
mean
to
land
and
not
return
i
do
know
doc
maybe
i
not
sure
i
ever
quite
believed
in
the
possibility
of
return
state
orphanage
children
like
ann
and
me
growing
up
in
a
tiny
world
within
a
big
one
we
were
quite
human
ever
were
we
not
that
the
big
world
did
seep
in
plenty
she
smiled
off
at
private
shadows
of
memory
we
did
learn
things
not
in
the
directors
curriculum
when
they
started
grooming
ann
and
me
for
this
youth
volunteers
stuffing
our
little
heads
with
the
best
they
had
oh
it
was
fun
too
by
that
time
i
think
i
had
a
fair
idea
of
the
big
world
the
orphanage
was
pleasant
you
know
clean
humanitarian
good
teachers
all
of
them
kind
and
more
than
a
bit
hurried
they
did
try
so
hard
never
to
let
me
hear
the
word
ignorance
is
poor
insulating
material
do
you
think
and
why
doc
after
all
been
known
and
thought
and
argued
for
the
last
hundred
years
they
select
at
least
one
oriental
for
our
little
trip
would
have
had
to
come
from
jenga
empire
our
own
states
in
the
federation
had
plenty
of
scholars
technicians
anything
you
care
to
name
wright
had
calmed
he
said
i
argued
for
it
and
got
told
they
even
said
that
the
spaceport
rights
and
privileges
recently
given
to
jenga
empire
would
allow
the
asiatics
to
build
their
own
ship
tacitly
implying
that
humanity
should
stay
in
two
camps
world
without
end
ach
you
can
shove
the
political
mind
just
so
far
then
it
stalls
in
its
own
dirt
even
jensen
was
able
to
budge
them
it
history
said
dorothy
and
paul
wondered
does
she
do
it
speaking
hands
and
voice
enough
to
shove
away
the
black
sorrow
even
before
it
fairly
had
hold
of
him
and
she
try
to
do
it
for
anyone
loved
or
not
she
was
the
first
and
only
one
who
said
to
me
there
are
some
things
more
important
than
she
herself
would
be
bothered
to
explain
that
in
well
dorothy
reflected
i
believe
the
orphanage
slapped
too
much
destiny
of
man
on
the
backs
of
our
little
necks
they
just
necks
paul
why
do
you
sleep
awhile
you
too
doc
let
me
keep
watch
i
wake
you
both
if
anything
stirs
out
there
doze
off
boys
paul
tried
to
his
mind
restless
in
weary
flesh
no
permissible
margin
of
error
said
the
century
but
lay
at
the
bottom
of
a
lake
because
of
an
error
not
an
error
like
the
gross
errors
century
man
still
made
in
dealing
with
his
own
kind
and
still
noisily
disregarded
but
an
engineering
error
something
man
viewed
with
a
horror
once
reserved
in
not
so
ancient
times
for
moral
evil
the
cardinal
sin
was
to
drop
a
decimal
if
like
wright
or
paul
himself
you
were
concerned
with
the
agony
and
growing
pains
of
human
nature
disturbed
by
the
paralytic
sterility
of
state
socialism
and
the
worse
paralysis
of
open
tyranny
you
kept
your
mouth
shut
or
even
yielded
almost
unknowingly
to
the
pressures
that
reduced
ethical
realities
to
a
piddling
checker
game
perverting
the
uses
of
semantics
they
said
there
wo
be
any
war
if
there
is
look
what
we
got
if
you
were
like
the
majority
of
earth
three
billion
you
hoped
to
get
by
with
as
much
as
the
traffic
would
bear
and
never
stuck
your
neck
out
they
celebrated
the
turn
of
the
third
millennium
with
a
jolly
new
song
snuggle
up
baby
uncle
pays
the
bill
but
for
all
that
you
must
use
the
wrong
bolt
unreasonably
quiet
here
a
jungle
evening
on
earth
would
have
been
riotous
with
bird
and
insect
noises
he
slept
it
was
dark
when
wright
finger
prodded
him
a
visitor
the
darkness
was
not
with
sunset
there
were
two
moons
paul
remembered
one
white
and
large
and
far
away
one
red
and
near
should
the
red
moon
be
shining
now
he
gazed
through
the
doorway
wondering
why
he
was
not
afraid
seeing
something
pale
and
vast
washed
in
yes
surely
in
reddish
a
thing
swaying
on
the
pillars
of
its
legs
perhaps
listening
tasting
the
air
for
strangeness
and
scattered
through
the
night
sapphires
on
black
velvet
were
tiny
dots
of
blue
moving
vanishing
reappearing
blue
fireflies
dorothy
whispered
blue
fireflies
that
all
they
are
he
felt
her
controlled
breathing
forced
down
a
foolish
laugh
could
have
done
without
a
white
nine
or
ten
feet
tall
at
the
shoulder
a
snout
black
tusks
bending
more
nearly
downward
than
an
elephant
from
flesh
the
ears
were
mobile
waving
to
study
the
night
there
was
an
oval
hump
near
the
base
of
the
neck
the
beast
had
been
facing
them
it
turned
to
pull
down
a
branch
munch
the
leaves
casually
drop
the
stalk
in
silence
it
drifted
away
pausing
to
meditate
grumbling
juicily
but
with
no
alarm
wright
whispered
the
planet
lucifer
did
not
ask
for
us
paul
i
stepped
out
for
a
minute
while
you
were
both
asleep
firm
ground
a
smell
flowers
i
think
made
me
remember
frangipani
i
try
it
oh
but
not
with
that
thing
he
did
seem
to
mind
us
i
stay
near
the
door
he
knew
dorothy
would
come
with
him
feeling
earth
under
legs
that
had
nearly
forgotten
it
he
turned
to
help
her
down
her
dark
eyes
played
diamond
games
with
the
it
could
have
been
a
night
anywhere
in
the
galaxy
up
there
beyond
torn
branches
stars
and
red
moon
in
a
vagueness
of
cloud
blue
fireflies
but
there
was
a
child
wailing
somewhere
and
weak
a
dim
rise
and
fall
of
sound
grief
and
remoteness
a
waterfall
wind
in
upper
branches
but
they
were
still
and
the
sound
carried
the
timbre
of
animal
life
dorothy
murmured
it
been
crying
that
way
ever
since
she
came
closely
into
his
arms
i
can
read
one
thing
inside
of
you
you
not
scared
i
not
paul
no
but
do
ever
leave
me
adam
this
was
dawn
vision
out
of
the
dark
ripples
of
music
coalescent
in
one
forest
voice
moving
toward
a
crescendo
of
daytime
paul
watched
a
spreading
of
color
in
the
leaves
a
shift
from
black
to
gray
to
a
loveliness
more
green
than
red
the
trees
were
massively
old
with
varied
bark
of
green
or
phantoms
in
the
more
distant
shadows
could
be
understood
now
that
light
was
advancing
they
were
thick
trees
with
a
white
bark
like
that
of
the
birches
of
new
hampshire
underfoot
paul
felt
a
humus
that
might
have
been
a
thousand
years
in
growing
he
prodded
it
with
his
knife
a
white
worm
curled
in
mimic
death
everywhere
vines
vastly
proliferating
climbed
in
a
riot
of
greed
for
the
sunlight
of
the
forest
ceiling
paul
sensed
a
mute
cruelty
in
them
a
shoving
lust
of
growth
it
might
have
been
these
elastically
yielding
that
had
saved
the
lifeboat
from
total
ruin
overnight
the
gravity
of
lucifer
had
become
natural
his
body
accepted
and
relished
it
finding
a
new
pleasure
in
strength
years
old
and
very
young
one
tiny
voice
was
near
persistent
paul
walked
around
the
boat
where
dorothy
and
wright
still
slept
the
starboard
wing
parting
from
the
lifeboat
had
gashed
a
tree
trunk
littering
the
ground
with
branches
the
source
of
the
voice
was
a
brown
lump
twenty
feet
up
clinging
head
downward
a
body
small
as
a
sparrow
wings
folded
like
a
bat
as
he
watched
they
spread
quivered
and
relaxed
head
and
ears
were
mousy
the
neck
long
with
a
hump
at
its
base
the
throat
pulsed
at
each
cry
near
paul
foot
lay
a
fabric
like
an
nest
fastened
to
a
twig
that
had
been
torn
from
the
tree
three
young
had
tumbled
out
one
was
not
mangled
but
all
were
dead
hairless
poignantly
ugly
sorry
baby
our
first
act
on
lucifer
the
parent
creature
made
another
abortive
motion
as
paul
took
up
the
young
its
high
lament
was
not
what
he
and
dorothy
had
heard
in
the
night
that
had
been
continuing
when
he
slipped
out
to
watch
for
dawn
and
it
had
ended
at
some
unnoticed
moment
profoundly
different
surely
far
off
he
tried
to
study
the
dead
things
as
sears
oliphant
would
want
to
do
two
were
hopelessly
torn
he
dug
a
hole
in
the
humus
and
dropped
those
in
smoothing
the
surface
wondering
at
his
need
for
an
act
which
could
mean
nothing
to
the
unhappy
morsel
of
perception
on
the
tree
trunk
the
third
and
the
nest
he
carried
around
the
boat
where
the
light
was
better
all
seven
digits
of
the
forelimb
spread
into
a
membranous
wing
the
hind
leg
divided
at
the
ankle
three
toes
anchoring
the
wing
the
other
four
fused
into
a
slim
foot
which
had
suction
pads
he
cradled
the
bit
of
mortality
in
his
palm
recalling
a
thing
wright
had
said
when
they
entered
the
lifeboat
captain
jensen
waiting
for
at
the
spaceport
trying
as
he
drank
sherry
with
christopher
wright
to
look
at
the
venture
under
the
aspect
of
eternity
had
said
he
liked
the
philosophical
implications
of
converter
into
which
his
own
body
was
strangely
soon
to
pass
what
was
wright
comment
eleven
years
later
all
life
is
cannibalism
benign
or
not
we
are
still
eating
the
dinosaurs
there
had
been
more
which
paul
could
not
remember
so
man
drove
eleven
years
through
space
and
killed
three
babies
there
was
no
element
of
perhaps
there
was
none
in
most
of
man
actions
over
the
millennia
wright
crawled
out
and
unrested
doc
let
me
introduce
wo
do
wright
peered
down
everything
is
including
the
posterity
dot
mentioned
well
now
what
a
nestling
our
crash
broke
the
nest
and
killed
the
young
wright
fingered
the
fabric
beautiful
leaves
gummed
together
with
some
secretion
with
a
doctor
intentness
he
added
how
feel
good
a
shadow
circled
paul
settled
on
his
arm
hobbling
toward
his
palm
and
what
it
held
he
felt
the
suction
cups
with
a
careful
mouth
the
creature
took
up
its
dead
and
flew
away
i
been
remembering
something
you
said
life
eating
life
without
too
much
concern
for
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
forgive
us
our
trespasses
good
morning
lady
what
did
i
miss
dorothy
had
glimpsed
the
departure
lucifer
idea
of
a
bat
i
think
that
big
flying
thing
i
saw
from
the
lifeboat
was
shaped
like
this
midget
have
seen
any
birds
dorothy
hugged
his
arm
not
even
one
measly
robin
sorry
whifflepuff
fresh
out
of
robins
wright
blinked
at
his
compass
meadow
that
way
paul
was
inattentive
needing
the
warm
quiet
of
the
woman
beside
him
wright
added
first
breakfast
he
broke
the
seal
of
a
ration
package
and
snarled
thirty
days
i
you
said
antique
garbage
dehydrated
hay
dorothy
said
you
nicest
when
you
mad
doc
we
soon
have
to
try
the
local
stuff
i
suppose
but
no
work
for
you
or
ann
she
was
startled
why
not
i
can
digest
boilerplate
two
women
on
lucifer
valuable
livestock
wright
smiled
with
his
mouth
full
i
boss
remember
for
work
the
men
draw
lots
she
was
grave
i
wo
argue
it
so
happens
she
peeked
into
the
nest
poor
little
fuzzies
lined
it
with
fur
their
own
i
bet
it
so
happens
what
dear
ah
this
gookum
claims
to
be
coffee
can
we
make
a
fire
looks
like
dead
wood
over
there
the
branches
burned
aromatically
the
morning
was
growing
into
deep
warmth
but
still
with
freshness
wright
said
coffee
my
shirt
dorothy
tasted
it
brr
i
was
about
to
say
when
i
interrupted
myself
it
so
happens
i
six
or
seven
weeks
pregnant
i
think
six
wright
set
his
aluminum
cup
carefully
upside
down
paul
mumbled
that
what
been
on
your
mind
behind
her
eyes
he
glimpsed
the
primitive
thing
deeper
than
thought
not
like
a
part
of
her
but
a
force
that
sustained
her
himself
all
others
the
three
billion
of
earth
the
small
grieving
spirit
now
flown
away
into
the
trees
yes
adam
i
would
have
told
you
sooner
but
we
all
had
a
lot
on
our
minds
even
before
we
got
in
orbit
you
saw
us
settling
staying
dorothy
grinned
then
paul
i
just
wanted
the
baby
could
have
been
born
on
the
ship
the
federation
said
no
but
gradually
paul
began
to
realize
it
but
you
said
yes
she
leaned
to
him
no
longer
smiling
i
said
yes
the
forest
floor
hushed
footsteps
some
coolness
lingered
paul
walked
in
front
then
dorothy
and
wright
marked
blazes
on
the
tree
trunks
paul
glanced
backward
often
to
capture
the
receding
patterns
at
the
third
such
pause
the
lifeboat
was
no
longer
visible
only
a
sameness
of
trees
and
sparse
young
life
groping
through
shadow
for
the
food
of
the
sun
in
this
depth
of
forest
there
was
no
brush
the
going
was
easy
except
for
the
nuisance
of
purple
vines
that
sometimes
looped
from
tree
to
tree
paul
searched
for
any
change
of
light
ahead
the
boat
held
all
but
what
they
wore
the
two
rifles
the
three
pistols
holstered
at
their
hips
the
three
knives
three
sealed
ration
packages
damage
had
prevented
locking
the
door
of
the
boat
to
rob
an
inhabitant
of
lucifer
would
need
only
intelligence
enough
to
solve
the
sliding
mechanism
they
had
seen
no
life
but
that
huge
nocturnal
leaf
eater
the
small
fliers
a
white
worm
and
now
a
few
timid
scuttlers
on
the
warm
ground
and
specks
dancing
in
shafts
of
sunlight
too
quietly
wright
said
stop
paul
raised
his
rifle
as
he
turned
only
untroubled
forest
warning
hand
lowered
almost
saw
it
heard
nothing
just
felt
a
watching
might
be
in
my
head
let
go
on
and
do
hurry
it
would
have
been
possible
to
hurry
even
with
an
eye
on
the
compass
it
would
have
been
possible
paul
thought
to
run
in
panic
fall
whimpering
and
waiting
but
you
would
do
it
no
shape
in
this
dim
region
could
be
right
or
wrong
the
trees
themselves
were
no
sweetly
familiar
beech
or
pine
they
halted
at
sight
of
a
new
sprawling
type
of
vine
uprooted
where
a
break
in
the
forest
ceiling
admitted
more
sunshine
the
earth
displayed
like
a
pig
some
scattered
tuberous
roots
were
marked
by
teeth
dorothy
sniffed
one
spud
with
garlic
for
a
papa
paul
pocketed
a
sample
she
said
not
that
lucifer
cares
doc
but
what
time
is
it
my
watch
says
we
been
walking
fifteen
minutes
take
it
slow
wright
presently
added
i
had
another
glimpse
not
a
good
one
furry
gray
and
white
white
face
splashes
of
white
on
a
gray
body
seven
or
eight
feet
tall
human
shape
we
may
be
all
right
if
we
bother
him
or
blunder
into
territory
where
he
does
want
us
there
is
that
paul
human
shape
said
dorothy
evenly
how
human
very
upright
head
ah
hear
that
it
was
voice
calling
from
someplace
where
there
should
be
sunlight
answer
just
yet
no
sudden
noises
close
to
paul
dorothy
whispered
the
baby
i
do
want
to
tell
the
others
quite
yet
that
made
it
real
so
real
that
in
spite
of
a
patch
of
beckoning
blue
paul
had
to
turn
to
her
behind
wright
he
saw
it
among
the
pillars
of
the
trees
retreating
in
fluid
slowness
till
it
was
only
a
black
ear
part
of
a
cheek
an
iridescent
green
eye
showing
like
a
cat
no
white
but
the
blue
was
also
real
the
edge
of
the
forest
was
a
mass
of
young
growth
fighting
for
the
gold
coin
of
sunlight
shield
your
faces
wright
was
panting
could
be
poisonous
leaves
they
broke
through
to
a
field
the
slim
silver
of
the
undamaged
boat
the
certainty
of
friends
an
expanse
of
lake
no
longer
blue
but
sickly
white
the
boat
nose
was
thrust
under
an
overhang
of
branches
ann
bryan
was
unsteady
and
wan
but
there
was
welcome
in
her
gray
eyes
for
dorothy
who
joined
her
at
once
and
whispered
with
her
sears
fat
affectionate
face
carried
a
determined
smile
ed
spearman
came
forward
alert
and
commanding
wright
asked
how
long
have
you
been
out
in
the
air
an
hour
ed
was
impatient
sealed
overnight
nothing
in
the
boat
for
a
test
of
the
air
no
point
in
waiting
you
okay
wright
watched
brown
wings
over
the
lake
what
are
those
birds
or
some
damn
thing
the
white
on
the
lake
is
dead
fish
i
suppose
the
ship
blew
under
water
or
the
impact
killed
them
our
geiger
says
the
water
is
radioactive
we
have
gone
into
the
meadow
been
waiting
for
you
in
the
south
the
meadow
reached
the
horizon
twenty
miles
of
it
paul
remembered
from
the
air
view
before
jungle
again
took
over
near
by
threads
of
smoke
were
rising
straight
from
the
grass
abandoned
fires
we
scared
off
maybe
spearman
said
seen
no
life
except
those
birds
bat
wings
sears
oliphant
remarked
mammalian
i
think
oh
my
yes
ca
have
furry
birds
you
know
with
a
taxonomist
in
the
family
hey
spearman
shrugged
must
get
organized
how
much
damage
paul
the
boat
itself
both
wings
off
radio
dead
could
lock
the
door
it
was
like
an
earth
landscape
tall
grass
carried
oatlike
ruddy
seed
clusters
on
green
stems
the
lake
was
bordered
by
white
sand
except
close
by
where
jungle
reached
into
water
there
was
casual
buzzing
traffic
above
the
grass
reminiscent
of
bees
wasps
flies
far
up
something
drifted
on
motionless
wings
circling
and
ten
or
fifteen
miles
to
the
west
there
was
the
calm
of
hills
rounded
old
more
green
than
blue
in
a
sleepy
haze
but
to
paint
them
paul
thought
you
would
shade
off
into
the
purple
paul
went
on
absently
we
have
the
charlesite
of
the
wrecked
boat
of
course
that
gives
this
one
a
theoretical
twenty
hours
of
jet
we
have
ammunition
for
long
enough
to
learn
how
to
use
bow
and
arrow
i
think
ann
muttered
paul
do
what
spearman
was
disgusted
oh
you
could
be
right
at
that
paul
hard
to
realize
well
we
must
make
some
kind
of
camp
wright
began
some
knowledge
of
the
life
around
us
oh
my
yes
we
have
to
make
a
camp
before
we
can
do
any
exploring
doc
here
out
in
the
open
see
anything
in
the
woods
something
followed
more
or
less
human
so
we
know
the
camp
has
to
be
in
the
open
do
we
ed
wright
watched
the
distant
bat
wings
spearman
stared
ca
chance
a
forest
we
do
know
still
i
mean
to
look
things
over
a
bit
feel
not
so
good
ann
all
right
she
said
glancing
from
wright
to
spearman
silently
begging
to
know
is
leader
slightly
doc
mm
sure
wright
hitched
his
rifle
going
to
look
at
that
nearest
smoke
you
come
paul
or
you
ed
one
of
you
should
stay
here
spearman
leaned
against
the
lifeboat
paul
can
go
if
he
wants
to
i
think
it
a
risk
and
a
waste
of
time
paul
watched
him
a
moment
frightened
not
by
a
man
whom
he
had
never
quite
been
able
to
like
but
by
the
withdrawal
itself
the
sense
of
a
barrier
to
communication
start
with
a
division
on
this
first
morning
of
the
world
paul
hugged
his
own
rifle
and
followed
wright
into
the
long
whisper
of
the
grass
moist
heat
pressed
down
but
the
air
of
the
meadow
was
sweet
there
were
marks
of
trampling
as
well
as
the
swath
the
boat
had
cut
trails
places
where
something
might
have
crouched
under
his
breath
wright
asked
feel
all
right
paul
truth
was
more
needed
than
a
show
of
courage
not
perfect
doc
am
i
flushed
you
are
a
little
yes
trace
of
fever
may
wear
off
here
something
they
had
not
come
far
two
red
bodies
barely
three
feet
tall
sprawled
near
each
other
face
down
in
the
grass
paul
noticed
oval
bulges
between
shoulder
blades
modified
to
accommodate
them
the
pathos
of
fingers
hands
holding
earth
in
a
final
grasp
the
male
wore
a
loincloth
of
black
fabric
and
a
quiver
almost
full
of
arrows
the
female
had
a
grass
skirt
and
her
hand
was
tight
on
a
spear
longer
than
herself
a
bow
of
carved
wood
lay
some
distance
away
one
could
see
how
the
little
man
had
crawled
in
his
agony
after
the
bow
was
lost
wright
turned
them
over
gently
bald
skulls
no
trace
of
body
hair
on
skin
of
a
rich
copper
color
exciting
to
a
painter
vision
green
eyes
with
no
visible
whites
in
human
faces
heavily
tattooed
eyes
accusing
no
one
the
bodies
were
in
rigor
a
shaft
in
the
man
neck
the
woman
pierced
by
an
arrow
in
the
side
blood
colored
the
grass
dry
but
eloquent
war
too
said
wright
and
pulled
out
the
arrows
showing
paul
the
stone
heads
the
intricate
carving
of
the
wood
wooden
vanes
taking
the
place
of
feathers
stone
age
war
the
male
pygmy
was
the
smaller
of
the
two
and
softer
his
shape
not
feminine
but
rounded
and
smooth
both
seemed
mature
so
far
as
age
could
be
guessed
at
all
the
woman
was
rugged
with
a
coarser
skin
and
the
scar
tissue
of
old
wounds
her
two
pairs
of
breasts
were
scarcely
more
prominent
than
the
ridged
muscles
of
her
midget
chest
wright
mulled
it
over
kneading
his
wrinkled
throat
physical
refinements
of
evolution
as
far
along
as
our
own
straight
thigh
and
neck
perfect
upright
posture
there
was
no
slouch
or
belly
sag
when
they
were
on
their
feet
human
jaw
big
brain
case
that
furry
giant
i
saw
in
the
woods
had
complete
upright
posture
too
oh
it
natural
paul
you
stick
fins
on
an
ocean
vertebrate
turn
him
into
a
land
animal
give
him
a
few
hundred
million
years
almost
bound
to
free
his
front
limbs
if
they
stayed
unspecialized
in
the
gaunt
face
sadness
and
pity
struggled
with
a
bitter
sort
of
mirth
the
brain
gets
large
boy
and
away
you
go
to
ach
to
the
federation
versus
the
asian
empire
lincoln
rembrandt
the
state
papers
of
abraham
brown
and
to
you
and
dorothy
and
the
baby
wright
stood
erect
brushing
bony
knees
calm
again
i
almost
pleased
to
find
it
this
primitive
i
do
think
it
can
have
gone
further
anywhere
on
the
planet
or
we
have
seen
cities
farms
roads
in
the
photographs
unless
unless
what
doctor
oh
unless
there
might
be
forms
with
no
earth
parallel
in
the
forests
perhaps
even
underground
thought
of
that
but
speculations
and
our
little
soldiers
here
are
fact
they
have
a
civilization
arrows
say
so
tattooing
garments
rigid
or
maybe
not
depending
on
how
much
language
developed
to
tie
in
knots
with
bow
and
arrow
why
suh
almost
as
advanced
as
not
being
afraid
to
end
a
sentence
with
a
preposition
hell
with
you
twenty
thousand
years
ago
or
whenever
it
was
we
reached
our
present
physique
if
there
been
anything
external
to
teach
men
how
to
behave
like
well
we
had
to
sweat
it
out
tribal
wars
bigger
wars
venerated
fears
errors
and
stupidities
but
maybe
here
are
big
enough
wright
shut
his
eyes
his
thin
cheeks
were
too
bright
there
was
a
tremor
in
the
rifle
tip
wish
i
knew
paul
we
have
to
try
ed
spearman
yelled
look
out
a
rifle
banged
and
a
pistol
a
brown
darkness
had
come
swooping
from
the
lake
others
followed
squealing
they
had
banked
at
the
noise
of
the
shots
to
circle
overhead
paul
fired
a
near
one
tumbled
screeching
thrashing
a
narrow
wolfish
head
on
a
long
neck
black
teeth
snapping
in
the
death
throes
but
even
now
it
was
trying
to
hobble
forward
and
get
at
them
the
others
wheeled
lower
until
wright
rifle
spoke
and
spearman
there
was
the
dry
slap
of
dorothy
automatic
pistol
back
to
the
trees
the
wounded
thing
on
the
ground
set
up
a
bubbling
howl
more
were
coming
with
weaving
of
pointed
heads
on
mobile
necks
paul
ran
wright
loping
beside
him
hearing
the
crash
of
their
friends
weapons
something
slammed
paul
shoulder
flopped
against
his
leg
tripping
him
he
tumbled
over
a
shape
furry
and
violent
that
smelled
of
fish
and
carrion
he
fought
clear
of
it
sobbing
in
animal
wrath
and
reached
the
shelter
of
the
trees
and
dorothy
embrace
sweat
blinded
him
wright
was
clutching
him
too
getting
his
jacket
off
flesh
wound
the
hind
foot
got
you
i
saw
it
ann
bryan
choked
saw
it
happen
filthy
claws
wright
had
a
bottle
of
antiseptic
son
you
ai
going
to
like
this
hang
on
to
the
lady
but
the
pain
was
a
welcome
flare
paul
eyes
cleared
as
wright
made
him
a
bandage
of
gauze
with
dorothy
help
he
could
look
from
the
shelter
of
overhanging
branches
at
a
confusion
of
wings
the
creatures
had
not
followed
as
far
as
the
lifeboat
perhaps
its
shining
mass
disturbed
them
spearman
groaned
you
go
out
wright
snapped
at
him
camp
in
the
open
some
disadvantages
granted
but
you
sure
learned
it
the
hard
way
eating
ann
pointed
nauseated
their
own
wounded
wright
stepped
between
her
and
the
loud
orgy
in
the
meadow
wing
spread
fifteen
feet
well
sky
bad
woods
maybe
what
do
you
suggest
clear
underbrush
spearman
said
so
we
can
see
into
the
woods
pile
it
just
beyond
this
overhang
of
branches
for
a
barrier
leave
a
space
so
we
can
reach
the
lifeboat
we
can
get
to
the
lake
for
water
without
going
much
in
the
open
good
said
wright
a
peace
offering
spearman
smiled
neutrally
if
the
water
safe
said
sears
oliphant
wright
grinned
at
the
fat
man
pal
it
better
be
miracles
sears
shoulders
shot
up
amiably
we
can
hope
it
is
with
boiling
got
ta
have
it
canteens
wo
last
the
day
in
this
heat
paul
helped
ed
unpack
tools
from
the
lifeboat
one
sickle
spearman
noted
no
scythe
garden
gadgets
pruning
shears
one
ax
one
damned
hatchet
no
scythe
no
scythe
there
were
two
or
three
on
the
ship
maybe
the
lake
not
so
deep
maybe
we
play
hell
trying
to
find
out
too
those
things
much
scared
by
the
shooting
hot
tedious
work
created
a
circle
of
clear
shaded
ground
which
must
be
called
home
a
fire
was
boiling
lake
water
in
the
few
aluminum
vessels
it
had
a
fishy
taste
and
could
not
be
cooled
but
it
eased
thirst
paul
had
glimpsed
ann
in
the
lifeboat
opening
her
violin
case
closing
it
he
had
marveled
again
at
the
mystery
of
a
federation
governing
of
a
world
which
had
genially
allowed
a
musician
to
carry
her
violin
on
man
greatest
venture
with
enough
strings
to
last
two
or
three
years
and
no
means
of
restringing
the
bow
later
ann
threw
herself
into
the
labor
of
clearing
brush
but
tired
quickly
from
her
own
violence
sears
microscope
occupied
a
camp
table
paul
and
dorothy
joined
him
in
a
pause
for
rest
got
anything
for
the
local
unboiled
lake
wrigglers
sears
mopped
his
cheeks
was
never
meant
my
name
should
be
linnaeus
have
a
look
the
world
on
the
slide
seemed
not
unlike
what
sears
had
once
shown
him
in
water
from
the
hydroponics
room
of
protoplasmic
abundance
no
mind
could
grasp
so
far
nothing
basically
different
from
what
you
find
in
lake
water
on
earth
except
for
the
trifle
that
every
species
is
unknown
hey
i
suppose
that
why
they
heaved
a
taxonomist
into
space
to
see
what
the
poor
cluck
would
do
hey
now
those
red
dots
are
something
like
algae
notice
a
big
ciliated
schlemihl
blundering
around
he
could
almost
be
old
man
paramecium
oh
my
yes
your
sickle
muscle
man
hot
work
jocko
take
it
slow
and
easy
believe
me
mistuh
mason
i
will
what
in
undergrowth
beyond
the
clearing
there
was
fury
a
crashing
of
branches
a
gray
and
white
man
shape
staggered
out
of
concealment
wrenching
at
what
looked
like
swollen
black
rope
but
the
rope
had
a
head
gripping
the
giant
forearm
a
black
loop
circled
the
giant
loins
and
his
free
arm
tearing
and
pounding
could
not
loosen
it
a
saurian
hind
leg
groped
hooking
for
purchase
into
gray
fur
paul
hunting
knife
was
out
there
was
time
only
for
recognition
the
gray
and
white
being
was
everything
human
caught
in
a
coil
paul
forced
himself
through
a
barrier
of
fear
hearing
wright
yell
shoot
ed
put
that
away
there
was
no
shot
paul
knew
he
was
between
spearman
and
the
confusion
of
combat
someone
was
blundering
behind
him
a
black
reptilian
tail
stretched
into
bushes
grasping
something
for
anchorage
paul
slashed
at
that
the
mass
of
heaving
life
rolled
on
the
ground
as
the
giant
lost
his
footing
serpent
teeth
still
buried
in
his
forearm
green
eyes
were
pleading
in
a
universal
language
wright
was
clutching
a
black
neck
with
no
strength
to
move
it
and
paul
stabbed
at
scaled
hide
behind
a
triangular
head
but
the
skin
was
like
metal
the
forelimbs
were
degenerate
vestiges
the
hind
legs
cruelly
functional
at
last
the
steel
penetrated
paul
twisted
it
probing
for
a
brain
the
giant
had
ceased
struggling
the
furred
face
was
close
paul
could
feel
the
difficult
breath
sense
a
rigid
waiting
the
teeth
let
go
the
giant
leaped
free
returning
at
once
with
a
stone
the
size
of
paul
chest
to
fling
it
down
on
the
body
repeating
the
action
till
his
enemy
was
a
smear
of
black
and
red
now
in
returning
quiet
a
furred
man
eight
feet
tall
watched
them
openly
wright
said
ed
put
away
that
gun
this
man
is
a
friend
man
spearman
holstered
his
automatic
ready
for
a
draw
your
daydreams
will
kill
us
all
yet
smile
all
of
you
maybe
his
mouth
does
the
same
thing
wright
stepped
to
the
trembling
monster
hands
open
ann
was
sobbing
in
reaction
smothering
the
sound
wright
pointed
at
himself
man
he
touched
the
gray
fur
man
the
giant
drew
back
not
with
violence
paul
felt
dorothy
small
fingers
shivering
on
his
arm
the
giant
sucked
his
wound
and
spat
turning
his
head
away
from
wright
to
do
it
man
man
hand
small
and
pale
as
an
oyster
shell
spread
beside
the
huge
palm
six
fingers
long
thumb
paul
your
kit
i
want
just
the
gauze
spearman
said
are
you
crazy
it
a
chance
sears
oliphant
said
in
a
level
careful
voice
doc
knows
what
he
doing
ed
you
should
know
you
ca
stop
him
wright
was
pointing
to
paul
bandaged
shoulder
and
to
the
wound
the
high
furred
forehead
puckered
in
obvious
effort
dorothy
was
choking
on
a
word
or
two
doc
must
you
he
knows
we
friends
he
been
watching
a
long
time
he
saw
paul
get
hurt
and
then
bandaged
the
giant
trembling
was
only
a
spasmodic
shuddering
man
man
wright
snipped
off
gauze
and
he
knows
that
thing
is
a
weapon
ed
will
you
put
it
away
he
could
break
you
in
two
you
know
that
do
you
but
he
wo
give
protoplasm
a
chance
now
wright
was
winding
gauze
lightly
firmly
hiding
the
already
clotting
blood
and
the
giant
made
no
move
of
rejection
man
man
man
the
giant
murmured
it
cautiously
prolonging
the
vowel
he
touched
his
chest
a
finger
ran
exploringly
over
the
gauze
essa
kana
man
said
wright
and
swayed
on
his
feet
the
giant
pointed
at
the
bloody
mess
on
the
ground
and
rumbled
he
shuddered
and
his
arm
swept
in
a
loose
gesture
that
appeared
to
indicate
the
curving
quarter
mile
where
lake
and
jungle
met
each
other
in
a
marsh
then
he
was
staring
out
muttering
at
the
wings
in
the
meadow
and
presently
he
touched
bandage
with
fantastic
lightness
he
said
pointing
at
the
flying
beasts
he
indicated
the
rifle
wobbling
in
sears
arm
and
held
up
two
fingers
omasha
yes
we
killed
two
omasha
the
giant
rumpled
his
chest
fur
mijok
mijok
why
did
i
have
you
in
anthropology
ia
fifteen
years
ago
cleaned
up
the
joint
mijok
knew
laughter
his
booming
in
response
to
wright
tone
and
smile
could
mean
nothing
else
but
wright
staggered
and
was
breathing
hard
dorothy
whispered
paul
it
could
not
be
pushed
aside
any
more
the
pain
separate
from
the
smart
of
his
shoulder
tightness
in
the
eyeballs
chill
nausea
the
air
wright
knees
buckled
sears
had
dropped
the
rifle
and
was
helping
him
to
the
lifeboat
paul
watching
the
action
in
a
daze
of
stupidity
wright
eyes
had
gone
empty
paul
was
uncertain
how
he
himself
came
to
be
sitting
on
the
ground
dorothy
face
was
somewhere
he
touched
it
her
brown
cheek
was
and
she
was
trying
to
speak
paul
take
care
of
you
always
the
face
of
mijok
was
there
too
red
vapor
turning
black
paul
mason
stared
into
blue
calm
airy
motion
of
branches
against
the
sky
a
mystery
remembered
from
long
ago
in
a
place
called
new
hampshire
those
years
were
not
dead
secretly
the
mind
had
brought
them
here
a
small
journey
less
than
five
on
a
star
map
you
could
hardly
represent
it
with
the
shortest
of
lines
he
was
without
pain
and
cool
time
why
that
amiable
thud
of
a
heart
in
a
firm
familiar
body
his
own
surely
that
was
indicating
time
the
boy
in
new
hampshire
after
sprawling
on
his
lazy
back
and
discovering
the
miracle
of
sky
had
he
tried
to
paint
it
even
then
messed
about
with
his
uncle
palette
creating
a
daub
that
had
oh
something
a
little
something
well
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
painter
named
paul
dorothy
you
back
oh
darling
no
paul
do
sit
up
fast
or
your
hurt
mine
did
now
she
was
curling
into
the
hollow
of
his
arm
laughing
and
weeping
you
back
a
thin
old
man
sat
on
gray
moss
paul
asked
him
how
long
christopher
wright
smiled
twisting
and
teasing
the
skin
of
his
gaunt
throat
gray
with
a
thick
beard
stubble
a
day
and
a
night
the
nurse
says
you
know
the
nurse
you
were
kissing
her
a
moment
ago
early
morning
again
paul
she
was
never
quite
unconscious
she
claims
i
recovered
an
hour
ago
no
ill
effects
it
knocked
out
the
others
at
nightfall
predictable
they
were
exposed
to
lucifer
air
thirteen
hours
later
than
we
were
paul
saw
them
now
lying
on
beds
of
the
gray
moss
and
where
he
and
dorothy
clung
to
each
other
was
the
same
pleasant
stuff
dry
spongy
with
an
odor
like
clover
hay
beds
by
courtesy
of
mijok
wright
nodded
toward
the
gray
giant
who
had
also
brought
moss
for
himself
and
now
sprawled
belly
down
breathing
silently
the
bulge
between
his
shoulder
blades
lightly
rising
and
falling
mijok
face
was
on
his
arm
turned
away
toward
the
purple
shadow
of
forest
dorothy
whispered
he
watched
over
us
all
night
so
you
were
conscious
all
the
time
tell
me
dorothy
kept
her
voice
low
paul
noticed
the
towering
slimness
of
the
lifeboat
beyond
the
barrier
of
branches
reversed
ed
spearman
work
he
supposed
it
pointed
toward
the
west
turned
so
the
jet
would
blast
toward
the
lake
harming
nothing
its
shadow
held
away
the
heat
of
the
sun
a
gleaming
artifact
of
century
man
the
one
alien
thing
in
this
wilderness
morning
the
sickness
dorothy
said
had
taken
her
with
a
sudden
paralysis
she
could
see
hear
be
aware
of
boiling
fever
but
could
not
move
then
even
the
sense
of
heat
left
her
she
was
only
observing
eyes
ears
and
a
brain
she
had
had
a
fantasy
that
she
was
dead
no
longer
breathing
but
i
breathed
her
small
brown
face
crinkled
with
a
laughter
rich
in
more
than
amusement
it
a
habit
i
do
mean
to
abandon
neurotoxin
said
wright
and
a
damn
funny
one
back
on
earth
when
i
believed
myself
to
be
a
doctor
i
never
heard
of
anything
like
it
the
condition
had
lasted
all
day
she
said
at
nightfall
her
sense
of
touch
had
gradually
returned
she
could
move
her
hands
later
her
feet
and
head
at
length
she
had
sat
up
briefly
blinded
by
pain
in
the
forehead
then
she
had
given
way
to
an
overwhelming
need
for
sleep
i
got
a
glimpse
of
you
paul
and
tumbled
off
into
a
set
of
dreams
that
were
not
so
bad
not
so
bad
i
woke
before
sunrise
different
ask
me
how
never
felt
healthier
not
even
weak
as
you
should
be
after
a
fever
but
doc
what
if
the
illness
wright
looked
away
from
the
terror
that
had
crossed
her
face
if
you
go
on
feeling
all
right
we
can
assume
nothing
wrong
with
the
baby
do
borrow
trouble
sugarpuss
we
got
enough
maybe
paul
suggested
the
illness
was
just
oh
some
of
our
earth
metabolism
getting
burned
out
of
us
a
stiff
acclimation
course
wright
grunted
pinching
his
long
nose
paul
said
wish
it
had
burned
out
the
yen
for
a
cigarette
that
i
had
for
eleven
years
sears
oliphant
the
only
other
with
some
medical
knowledge
had
taken
charge
immediately
after
their
collapse
he
is
scared
paul
dorothy
murmured
of
lucifer
i
mean
i
could
feel
it
when
i
was
just
a
pair
of
eyes
and
ears
more
physical
shrinking
in
him
than
in
the
rest
of
us
and
he
fighting
it
back
with
all
he
got
he
a
very
big
man
paul
sears
looked
peaceful
enough
now
in
the
dark
sleep
of
the
sickness
his
moon
face
bristling
with
black
beard
growth
but
relaxed
and
bland
on
another
couch
of
moss
spearman
was
more
restless
powerful
arms
twitching
as
if
he
needed
to
fight
the
disaster
even
in
sleep
ann
bryan
was
deeply
flushed
and
moaned
a
little
now
and
then
ed
was
all
right
too
considerate
took
all
sears
orders
without
any
fuss
or
question
i
do
think
he
much
scared
he
feels
he
can
bull
his
way
through
anything
and
maybe
right
dorothy
helpless
eyes
had
also
seen
mijok
bringing
moss
in
great
armfuls
this
she
thought
had
helped
ed
spearman
to
accept
the
giant
as
a
man
and
perhaps
as
a
friend
she
remembered
mijok
raising
paul
and
herself
in
one
careful
swing
of
his
arms
to
set
them
down
beside
each
other
on
the
moss
later
she
had
watched
him
turning
the
lifeboat
under
direction
of
spearman
blunt
gestures
its
length
was
feet
its
weight
over
three
tons
earth
gravity
more
here
one
arm
had
lifted
the
tail
and
swung
the
boat
on
its
landing
gear
as
a
man
might
push
a
light
automobile
i
was
afraid
after
dark
when
i
knew
the
sickness
had
got
the
others
i
still
was
afraid
believe
me
i
could
see
mijok
moving
around
once
i
heard
him
growl
i
think
he
was
driving
something
off
and
then
while
the
red
moon
was
coming
up
he
sat
by
us
his
eyes
are
red
in
the
dark
paul
not
green
he
smells
musky
at
close
range
but
clean
i
was
afraid
now
and
then
he
look
us
over
and
smile
with
his
funny
black
lips
and
touch
the
furry
back
of
his
finger
to
our
foreheads
i
could
see
the
blue
fireflies
paul
someday
you
make
up
stories
about
them
for
the
baby
i
heard
that
crying
again
much
nearer
than
when
we
heard
it
that
first
night
by
the
other
lifeboat
like
a
group
of
children
crying
if
you
can
imagine
that
synchronized
almost
musical
mijok
growled
and
fretted
when
it
began
but
it
came
no
nearer
it
had
stopped
when
i
woke
some
of
earth
critters
sounded
human
panthers
owls
frogs
just
possibly
something
like
tree
frogs
wright
said
mijok
brought
us
raw
meat
this
morning
before
he
went
to
sleep
something
like
a
deer
haunch
the
fire
bothers
him
he
evidently
did
go
near
it
last
night
after
the
others
collapsed
ed
tried
to
show
him
about
fire
dorothy
said
i
remember
mijok
was
scared
and
sears
told
ed
to
let
it
wait
meat
was
good
too
wright
smirked
we
got
the
fire
going
and
mijok
did
try
some
cooked
and
liked
it
you
and
dorothy
can
have
some
tomorrow
if
i
do
turn
purple
not
said
dorothy
just
pig
hungry
wright
tossed
paul
a
ration
package
gah
but
he
opened
it
learned
any
more
of
mijok
words
no
he
wo
have
many
nouns
simple
descriptives
must
have
some
continuing
association
with
his
own
breed
or
he
have
no
words
at
all
a
hunter
with
only
nature
weapons
i
think
that
haunch
was
torn
not
cut
some
hoofed
animal
smaller
than
a
pony
and
well
bled
he
must
have
got
it
while
dorothy
slept
it
may
have
strayed
into
the
camp
during
the
night
i
think
mijok
lives
in
the
woods
maybe
not
even
a
shelter
or
a
permanent
mate
anthropology
ia
said
wright
and
bowed
in
mimic
apology
to
the
sleeping
giant
those
pygmies
will
be
something
else
again
neolithic
wish
i
understood
that
bulge
between
the
shoulder
blades
all
the
creatures
we
seen
have
it
even
that
damn
black
reptile
i
believe
though
things
were
too
mixed
up
to
be
sure
mijok
woke
all
at
once
like
a
cat
he
stretched
extending
his
arms
twelve
feet
from
wrist
to
wrist
he
smiled
down
at
paul
he
studied
the
helpless
ones
peering
longest
at
ann
bryan
the
girl
was
breathing
harshly
fidgeting
now
and
then
her
eyes
flickered
open
and
perhaps
they
saw
softly
as
smoke
mijok
stepped
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
listened
wright
remarked
speaking
of
that
reptile
we
should
set
up
a
monument
to
it
nothing
luckier
could
have
happened
than
that
chance
to
lend
mijok
a
hand
his
gray
eyes
fixed
on
paul
lids
lowered
in
a
speculative
smile
i
not
the
only
one
who
remembers
paul
that
you
were
the
first
to
go
to
his
help
he
forgotten
dot
you
sure
ed
understood
that
we
have
a
friend
there
he
seemed
to
doc
i
watched
them
they
got
along
practically
buddies
paul
saw
the
bandage
was
still
on
mijok
arm
and
with
fragments
of
gray
moss
but
not
disarranged
the
bandage
on
his
own
shoulder
had
been
removed
the
flying
beast
attack
had
left
only
a
heavy
scratch
which
looked
clean
there
was
no
pain
only
an
itching
the
meadow
was
empty
of
brown
wings
the
dead
fish
were
gone
from
the
lake
perhaps
other
scavengers
had
been
busy
in
the
night
the
water
was
an
innocent
blue
a
luminous
stillness
under
the
sun
mijok
stole
out
into
the
grass
gazing
westward
along
the
line
where
meadow
met
jungle
returning
he
squatted
by
wright
and
muttered
he
spread
a
hand
three
feet
above
the
ground
two
fingers
drooped
and
indicated
the
motion
of
walking
legs
paul
suggested
pygmies
could
be
mijok
stared
eloquently
at
wright
rifle
then
crouched
at
the
barrier
of
branches
complaining
in
his
throat
taking
up
his
own
rifle
paul
joined
him
dorothy
hurried
to
the
lifeboat
and
came
back
with
field
glasses
for
him
and
wright
and
herself
in
spite
of
the
great
planet
heavy
pull
her
body
moved
with
even
more
light
easiness
than
it
had
shown
in
the
unreal
years
of
with
the
glasses
vague
motion
a
quarter
mile
away
in
the
meadow
leaped
shockingly
into
precision
the
pygmies
were
not
approaching
but
heading
out
from
the
edge
of
the
forest
a
group
of
nine
barely
taller
than
the
grass
bald
red
heads
and
shoulders
in
single
file
the
rearmost
had
a
burden
seven
others
carried
bows
with
quivers
on
the
right
hip
paul
observed
aloud
the
leader
was
the
tallest
a
woman
with
a
long
spear
all
were
sending
anxious
glances
at
the
sky
and
toward
the
human
shelter
their
motions
suggested
a
fear
so
deep
it
must
be
pain
yet
something
drew
them
out
there
in
spite
of
it
the
pygmy
with
the
burden
a
hide
was
also
a
woman
the
leader
was
bald
as
the
others
slender
muscular
her
head
round
with
prominent
forehead
and
thin
nose
tattooed
cheeks
the
bowmen
had
only
simple
loincloths
and
belts
for
their
arrow
quivers
the
women
grass
skirts
were
like
the
melanesian
but
the
leader
was
dyed
a
brilliant
blue
her
two
little
pairs
of
breasts
were
youthfully
firm
and
pointed
dorothy
murmured
american
civilization
would
have
gone
mad
about
those
people
what
a
girl
wright
sighed
i
mean
dorothy
the
dope
even
a
dope
can
be
jealous
do
you
mijok
has
oh
oh
poor
darling
not
funny
after
all
gentlemen
the
pygmy
leader
had
turned
full
face
as
the
nine
paused
at
trampled
grass
she
wore
a
necklace
of
shell
these
had
no
glitter
but
their
yellow
and
blue
made
handsome
splashes
against
the
red
of
her
skin
reason
told
paul
that
she
could
see
at
most
only
dazzling
spots
where
sunlight
might
be
touching
the
glasses
he
had
thrust
through
wilted
leaves
it
made
no
difference
she
was
staring
directly
into
him
making
her
grief
a
part
of
his
life
a
grief
too
profound
for
any
tears
if
she
knew
of
tears
the
green
cat
eyes
lowered
she
stabbed
her
spear
into
the
ground
and
lifted
her
arms
a
giving
yielding
motion
her
lips
moved
in
prayer
surely
since
all
but
one
of
the
men
were
bowed
performing
ritual
gestures
toward
whatever
lay
on
the
ground
the
one
who
did
not
bow
never
ceased
to
watch
the
sky
the
prayer
was
brief
the
woman
left
hand
dropped
meaningly
the
hide
was
unrolled
and
its
bearer
raised
what
the
grass
had
hidden
no
more
than
a
skull
and
a
few
bones
a
broken
spear
a
muddy
scrap
that
might
have
been
a
grass
skirt
the
hide
was
folded
gently
over
these
the
group
went
on
dorothy
those
things
you
saw
running
when
we
were
circling
down
i
missed
wright
said
poor
eyesight
and
seems
to
me
the
air
was
still
misty
from
crash
in
the
lake
they
were
going
south
away
from
here
and
they
could
have
been
people
like
these
yes
hundreds
or
thousands
of
them
i
suppose
the
crash
of
must
have
seemed
like
the
heavens
falling
the
lifeboats
too
i
think
we
interrupted
a
war
these
would
be
survivors
live
in
this
part
of
the
jungle
maybe
looking
for
what
left
after
those
those
flying
beasts
it
makes
sense
wright
said
they
more
afraid
of
the
sky
than
of
our
setup
over
here
maybe
we
gods
who
came
down
to
help
them
if
we
did
help
them
look
they
found
another
yes
now
the
prayer
wish
mijok
was
so
afraid
of
them
inevitable
to
them
i
suppose
he
an
ugly
wild
animal
different
species
similar
enough
to
be
shocked
at
the
similarity
good
do
we
try
for
a
foot
in
both
camps
paul
i
think
i
take
a
rain
check
on
answering
that
ach
if
i
could
go
out
there
now
communicate
no
dorothy
gasped
not
while
the
others
are
still
sick
you
right
of
course
wright
fretted
at
his
beard
stubble
i
get
sillier
all
the
time
as
ed
would
tell
me
if
he
were
up
and
around
it
the
high
oxygen
there
were
brown
splashes
in
the
sky
the
pygmies
saw
the
peril
first
and
darted
for
the
woods
an
orderly
flight
however
the
woman
with
the
hide
in
front
the
woman
next
then
the
bowmen
three
of
the
latter
turned
bravely
and
shot
arrows
that
glittered
and
whined
the
brown
beasts
wheeled
and
flapped
angrily
upward
though
the
buzzing
arrows
dropped
far
short
of
them
the
pygmies
gained
the
trees
the
omasha
scouted
the
edge
of
the
woods
squawking
three
of
them
drifting
toward
the
lifeboat
weaving
heads
surveying
the
ground
paul
gave
way
to
unfamiliar
savage
enjoyment
do
we
doc
yes
said
wright
and
took
aim
himself
all
three
were
brought
down
at
a
cost
of
four
irreplaceable
rifle
bullets
and
two
shots
from
dorothy
automatic
mijok
bellowed
with
satisfaction
but
recoiled
as
wright
dragged
a
dirty
brown
carcass
into
the
clearing
a
dissection
is
in
order
mijok
grumbled
and
fidgeted
do
fret
mijok
wright
pegged
down
the
wings
of
the
dead
animal
with
sharp
sticks
and
drew
an
incision
on
the
leathery
belly
with
his
hunting
knife
good
head
shot
paul
this
one
yours
we
do
a
brain
job
from
one
of
the
others
but
i
think
we
let
that
wait
for
sears
oh
my
yes
does
weigh
over
thirty
pounds
hollow
bones
like
a
bird
very
likely
hope
they
keep
you
hope
dorothy
sniffed
what
do
you
do
when
i
turn
housewife
and
instruct
you
to
get
that
awful
mess
the
hell
off
my
nice
clean
floor
dope
and
you
my
best
and
only
medical
student
he
worked
at
the
cutting
dubiously
inexpertly
conventional
mammalian
setup
more
or
less
small
lungs
big
stomach
hah
two
pairs
of
kidneys
he
spread
the
viscera
out
on
the
wing
short
intestine
also
like
a
bird
and
she
was
preparing
a
blessed
event
multiplied
by
count
six
too
many
said
paul
altogether
too
industrious
what
i
really
want
to
know
oh
with
the
lungs
removed
it
could
be
seen
that
the
hump
on
the
back
was
caused
by
a
great
enlargement
of
four
thoracic
vertebrae
which
swelled
into
the
chest
cavity
as
well
as
outward
wright
cut
away
spinal
cartilage
damn
i
sears
was
doing
this
well
it
neural
tissue
nothing
else
a
big
swelling
of
the
spinal
cord
he
sliced
at
the
ugly
head
but
the
hermorrhage
from
a
bullet
confused
the
picture
the
brain
looks
too
simple
could
that
lump
in
the
cord
be
the
hind
brain
i
hereby
leave
the
theories
to
sears
but
son
you
might
slit
the
stomach
and
see
what
the
old
lady
had
for
breakfast
paul
clumsy
cut
on
the
slippery
stomach
bag
made
it
plain
what
the
omasha
had
eaten
among
other
things
an
almost
complete
hand
dorothy
choked
and
walked
away
saying
i
am
going
to
be
cheer
up
paul
held
her
forehead
never
mind
the
clean
floor
go
away
i
mean
stay
very
close
sorry
to
be
so
physiological
me
a
medic
student
even
blood
bothers
me
never
mind
sugar
sugar
yourself
and
wash
your
paws
we
smell
mijok
was
muttering
in
alarm
wright
had
abandoned
the
dissection
and
gone
out
in
the
meadow
cautious
but
swift
to
the
spot
where
yesterday
they
had
found
the
pygmy
soldiers
he
took
up
a
small
skull
and
arm
bone
pathetically
clean
perhaps
there
were
insect
scavengers
that
followed
after
the
omasha
and
the
discarded
bow
but
instead
of
bringing
back
these
relics
wright
held
them
high
over
his
head
facing
westward
tall
and
gray
in
the
heavy
sun
he
stepped
twenty
paces
further
toward
the
region
where
the
pygmies
had
entered
the
jungle
then
he
set
the
bones
down
in
the
grass
and
strode
back
to
the
shelter
fingers
twitching
lips
moving
in
his
old
habit
of
talking
half
to
himself
half
to
the
world
the
omasha
he
said
cracked
the
enlarged
vertebrae
favorite
morsel
maybe
mijok
moaned
blinking
and
sighing
he
stared
long
at
the
silent
grace
of
the
lifeboat
then
at
christopher
wright
he
too
was
talking
to
himself
abruptly
something
gave
way
in
him
he
was
kneeling
before
wright
bending
forward
taking
wright
hands
and
pressing
them
against
the
fur
of
his
face
and
his
closed
eyes
oh
now
wright
said
now
friend
paul
remarked
you
elected
i
will
not
be
a
god
mijok
released
the
hands
of
his
deity
and
sat
back
on
his
haunches
wright
stroked
the
great
furry
head
troubled
and
amazed
it
wo
do
wright
said
we
have
no
gods
on
this
planet
unless
human
nature
can
make
itself
a
little
godlike
and
no
final
armageddon
for
that
within
too
and
always
was
well
he
learn
language
fast
as
he
does
the
first
thing
he
must
discover
is
that
we
all
one
flesh
but
mijok
was
gazing
up
in
adoration
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
trembling
not
in
fear
smiling
when
he
saw
wright
smile
i
believe
he
never
had
a
god
before
had
reached
the
stage
of
personalizing
the
forces
of
nature
they
just
forces
and
himself
a
bundle
of
perception
not
even
realizing
that
he
more
knowing
and
sensitive
than
other
animals
not
arrogant
yet
not
sophisticated
enough
to
be
cruel
or
mean
or
even
ambitious
dorothy
pushed
her
fists
into
her
cheeks
brown
eyes
upturned
to
study
the
old
man
a
way
she
had
carrying
paul
back
eleven
years
to
the
day
he
had
come
aboard
the
ship
and
seen
her
for
the
first
time
and
loved
the
woman
who
was
even
then
manifest
in
the
leggy
awkward
child
doc
why
did
you
do
that
out
there
in
the
meadow
why
dorothy
we
must
make
contact
with
those
pygmies
too
they
are
advanced
it
be
more
difficult
they
have
traditions
maybe
some
very
ancient
ones
but
we
must
make
contact
mijok
hates
them
though
if
they
come
here
wright
grinned
temporary
advantage
of
being
little
tin
deities
i
think
mijok
will
do
whatever
we
indicate
until
we
able
to
teach
him
independence
paul
said
do
think
for
a
minute
i
not
with
you
but
doc
with
the
others
helpless
we
only
three
four
yes
four
there
our
own
survival
to
think
of
it
a
big
planet
seems
to
me
you
taking
it
on
all
at
once
wright
slouched
at
the
barrier
where
he
could
watch
the
meadow
and
mijok
stayed
close
to
him
i
think
we
must
paul
if
we
start
right
perhaps
we
can
go
on
right
a
mistake
at
this
point
could
go
on
burning
for
a
thousand
years
why
do
you
think
he
broke
out
into
worship
when
he
did
our
superior
achievements
lifeboat
guns
the
rescue
from
that
reptile
the
fact
that
i
was
afraid
of
a
poor
pygmy
bones
all
that
sure
but
something
else
ed
would
say
i
was
daydreaming
but
i
think
mijok
heart
knows
what
his
brain
yet
interpret
sears
would
agree
i
think
his
own
heart
bigger
than
lucifer
mijok
has
the
least
conscious
idea
why
i
invited
those
pygmies
to
come
and
get
their
dead
down
deeper
in
the
part
of
him
that
made
him
bring
the
moss
and
the
meat
and
take
care
of
us
i
think
he
knows
very
well
you
proposing
dorothy
said
to
take
a
chance
on
love
wright
was
tranquil
watching
the
meadow
whenever
men
put
their
chips
on
the
other
thing
they
always
lost
did
they
repeatedly
for
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
years
did
they
ever
create
anything
good
except
in
a
milieu
of
friendship
forbearance
one
of
the
oldest
of
commonplaces
the
teachers
all
knew
it
buddha
or
stated
negatively
who
lives
by
the
sword
and
so
on
good
is
not
the
mere
absence
of
evil
but
the
most
positive
of
human
forces
the
instruments
of
good
are
charity
patience
courage
effort
and
each
unavailing
without
the
others
remember
that
and
that
all
the
basic
ethics
i
know
the
rest
is
detail
solution
of
immediate
problems
as
they
arise
even
on
earth
the
good
tended
to
win
out
in
the
long
run
at
least
it
did
until
the
mechanical
toys
got
out
of
hand
then
there
was
a
century
of
living
under
a
question
mark
there
was
also
the
collectivist
party
yes
as
a
prime
example
of
a
part
of
my
own
philosophy
totally
perverted
i
give
you
the
collectivist
party
wright
was
talking
to
himself
again
the
bitterness
of
earth
history
goading
him
into
monotone
drawling
and
dark
on
a
planet
nearly
five
distant
from
the
ancient
confusions
the
collectivist
party
which
turns
into
the
same
sort
of
word
fetish
that
was
less
than
a
hundred
years
ago
charity
without
patience
without
courage
and
always
always
without
dorothy
still
watched
him
with
sober
upturned
eyes
ed
told
me
once
his
father
was
a
pilot
in
the
collectivist
army
during
the
civil
war
i
know
wright
smiled
at
her
in
bashful
half
apology
some
of
the
old
wounds
still
bleed
too
i
guess
i
generally
manage
to
keep
my
political
mouth
shut
when
he
listening
if
i
can
not
that
ed
could
be
accused
of
still
fighting
the
war
that
ended
before
he
was
born
relax
i
think
they
coming
paul
joined
wright
and
the
giant
at
the
barrier
but
dorothy
stayed
a
moment
with
the
sick
feeling
their
wrists
murmuring
something
close
to
ann
ear
although
the
girl
could
not
respond
past
the
fever
stage
i
believe
she
said
they
all
breathing
well
no
chance
they
be
out
of
it
before
night
i
suppose
the
pygmies
were
still
some
distance
away
slipping
along
the
edge
of
the
woods
in
plain
sight
there
were
only
three
the
two
women
and
one
bowman
perhaps
the
others
were
paralleling
their
course
inside
the
forest
perhaps
a
hundred
others
were
wright
whispered
have
we
anything
that
would
make
a
respectable
gift
mijok
was
rumbling
in
misery
and
fright
dorothy
came
over
holding
a
locket
this
you
remember
doc
a
matron
at
the
orphanage
gave
it
to
me
i
used
to
imagine
it
could
be
a
portrait
of
my
mother
but
my
dear
the
brown
girl
shook
her
head
this
wedding
ring
paul
hammered
out
for
me
that
the
only
earth
jewelry
i
want
to
keep
this
face
that
might
be
like
my
mother
oh
doc
i
getting
to
be
a
big
girl
now
besides
lucifer
will
have
plenty
of
pretties
for
us
later
on
and
doc
let
me
do
this
will
you
they
got
a
woman
leading
so
would
she
be
less
afraid
of
another
woman
uncover
so
she
dorothy
shrugged
out
of
her
jacket
please
doc
i
scared
but
wright
glanced
helplessly
at
paul
we
dorothy
said
quickly
decision
holding
the
locket
up
for
the
sun
to
gleam
on
it
she
walked
into
the
meadow
and
waited
in
the
brightness
paul
hand
sweated
on
the
rifle
stock
he
saw
wright
patting
mijok
arm
heard
his
restraining
murmur
quiet
mijok
keep
your
shirt
on
mijok
old
man
man
mijok
searched
the
face
of
his
god
with
a
mute
desperation
and
remained
as
he
was
the
pygmy
woman
halted
fifty
feet
away
in
musing
as
paul
had
seen
through
the
binoculars
she
was
elaborately
tattooed
and
young
the
pause
was
long
dorothy
stepped
nearer
to
the
place
where
wright
had
left
the
bones
displaying
the
locket
her
open
left
hand
waving
down
at
her
body
to
demonstrate
that
she
carried
no
weapons
for
the
first
time
paul
realized
she
had
left
her
holster
belt
behind
the
woman
shrilled
a
word
her
two
followers
fell
back
she
thrust
the
blunt
end
of
her
spear
in
the
ground
and
came
forward
steadily
until
she
was
only
a
few
feet
from
the
woman
of
the
century
she
met
dorothy
smile
with
a
long
scrutiny
now
and
then
the
green
eyes
shifted
to
study
the
clearing
the
lifeboat
the
quiet
shapes
of
paul
and
wright
and
mijok
perhaps
she
stared
longest
at
mijok
but
by
some
heavy
discipline
her
face
refused
to
tell
of
anything
but
dignity
and
caution
she
spoke
at
last
it
was
complex
in
a
tone
like
the
piping
of
a
tree
frog
there
were
pauses
studied
inflections
no
gestures
her
hands
hung
limp
against
the
blue
grass
skirt
the
closing
words
seemed
to
have
a
note
of
questioning
and
of
sternness
she
waited
dorothy
contralto
was
startlingly
deep
in
contrast
darling
i
would
like
to
know
where
you
picked
up
that
perfectly
adorable
only
i
do
think
it
would
suit
me
i
to
put
it
frankly
a
shade
too
hippy
for
such
in
case
you
wondering
i
a
female
sample
of
man
she
touched
herself
and
pointed
to
the
pygmy
lady
man
oh
wright
whispered
good
girl
good
and
it
does
seem
to
me
us
girls
ought
to
stick
together
because
she
held
out
the
locket
well
just
because
and
anyway
look
i
have
only
ten
toes
fastened
on
to
the
ends
of
my
feet
and
if
i
had
more
heaven
knows
just
count
and
how
each
grows
i
have
trouble
in
keeping
them
neat
pome
there
now
sweetie
pie
please
take
it
huh
and
she
opened
the
locket
paul
remembering
in
lessening
panic
how
much
the
unknown
portrait
did
resemble
her
and
held
it
face
out
to
the
woman
of
lucifer
a
tiny
palm
came
up
dubiously
dorothy
placed
the
locket
in
it
it
wo
bite
baby
the
pygmy
woman
turned
it
about
puzzling
at
the
hinge
dorothy
stooped
to
demonstrate
the
mechanism
a
few
times
i
dorothy
by
the
way
more
widely
known
as
the
dope
which
is
a
title
of
uncommon
distinction
among
my
people
achieved
only
after
long
study
of
the
art
of
saying
the
right
thing
at
the
wrong
time
burning
the
bacon
and
preserving
at
all
times
an
air
of
sweet
and
addled
dignity
dorothy
she
indicated
herself
plainly
and
pointed
with
questioning
eyebrows
the
voice
with
no
sternness
but
a
hint
of
friendliness
she
imitated
dorothy
motions
abro
pakriaa
pakriaa
abro
pakriaa
there
was
sternness
again
in
that
correction
abro
pakriaa
wright
muttered
royalty
i
believe
do
dare
do
any
coaching
trust
dot
instinct
ah
here
we
go
the
pygmy
woman
had
taken
off
her
shell
necklace
she
crushed
the
dainty
blue
and
yellow
against
her
upper
right
breast
she
set
it
for
a
moment
on
her
shining
hairless
skull
and
then
offered
it
wright
sighed
shaken
it
to
work
exchange
of
gifts
a
universal
when
dorothy
dropped
on
one
knee
to
take
it
the
mask
relaxed
for
the
first
time
in
a
wintry
smile
over
the
proud
bald
head
went
the
chain
of
the
locket
and
abro
pakriaa
watched
dorothy
put
the
necklace
on
fortunately
it
was
long
even
drooping
a
little
below
throat
a
flutter
of
red
hands
seemed
to
mean
that
dorothy
was
to
stand
back
another
motion
brought
forward
the
woman
who
carried
the
hide
her
face
a
chip
of
red
stone
the
hide
was
unrolled
and
the
bones
placed
on
it
there
was
more
intricate
speech
with
touching
of
the
locket
and
graceful
apparently
kindly
waving
of
thin
arms
dorothy
responded
four
score
and
seven
years
ago
she
went
on
to
the
end
without
mirth
or
hesitation
fondling
the
shell
necklace
giving
the
words
the
power
of
music
that
belongs
to
them
even
apart
from
knowledge
of
their
meaning
when
she
was
silent
abro
pakriaa
motioned
the
woman
with
the
hide
to
go
and
held
up
her
two
hands
clasped
together
the
chinese
salutation
she
waited
till
dorothy
had
done
the
same
and
strode
away
recovering
her
spear
without
a
backward
look
vanishing
under
the
trees
dorothy
collapsed
in
the
shadow
of
the
barrier
tentatively
she
groaned
how
i
doing
wright
snarled
suppose
you
know
that
damn
bowman
had
an
arrow
trained
on
you
the
whole
time
she
glanced
at
him
lips
quivering
i
was
kind
of
aware
of
it
can
i
said
paul
touch
the
hand
that
touched
the
hand
oh
no
i
ain
gon
na
with
no
common
scum
no
mo
mijok
stared
in
wonder
at
their
sudden
paroxysms
of
hysterical
laughter
he
rumbled
in
doubt
then
the
contagion
caught
him
whatever
his
own
interpretation
might
be
he
was
bellowing
hammering
his
chest
rolling
over
on
the
moss
and
scattering
handfuls
of
it
while
he
roared
he
did
not
sober
until
he
saw
wright
drawing
pictures
on
the
earth
three
stylized
but
obvious
human
figures
one
small
one
one
large
only
the
middle
one
had
five
fingers
wright
gouged
a
circle
around
all
three
he
said
mijok
language
lesson
the
trail
was
obvious
only
to
the
pygmies
through
a
border
region
of
meadow
and
forest
that
was
full
of
dappled
light
a
warm
hurry
of
life
feeding
struggling
wandering
aware
of
his
own
power
and
readiness
able
now
to
enjoy
the
shifting
scents
and
noises
of
this
new
trail
paul
watched
ann
quick
slenderness
and
the
swing
of
spearman
solid
shoulders
they
and
sears
oliphant
had
emerged
unharmed
from
the
illness
during
a
week
unmeasurably
long
in
retrospect
all
six
of
the
party
had
found
the
ease
and
sureness
of
physical
acclimation
their
bodies
rejoiced
in
the
hot
clean
air
of
day
and
the
moist
moderate
nights
the
only
rebel
was
the
brain
grudging
frightened
trailing
making
endless
reservations
and
timid
of
shadows
in
sears
oliphant
it
was
an
almost
open
battle
between
a
brave
and
curious
mind
and
flesh
that
could
not
hide
its
wincing
from
pain
and
danger
his
oh
my
yes
had
a
tremor
which
angered
himself
and
oppressed
his
natural
garrulity
when
ann
bryan
had
drifted
out
of
the
sleep
of
illness
ed
spearman
was
petting
her
hands
sponging
her
forehead
paul
had
seen
something
happen
in
ann
at
that
moment
like
an
innocent
putting
forth
of
leaves
when
winter
is
not
surely
gone
ann
had
never
taken
a
lover
on
the
ship
not
so
much
unawakened
as
unwilling
she
had
rejected
all
that
spearman
making
no
secret
of
wanting
her
had
not
been
insistent
nor
had
he
seemed
outwardly
much
distressed
but
at
a
time
when
youth
of
his
nature
would
have
been
in
their
liveliest
and
most
demanding
prime
he
had
buried
himself
in
technical
library
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
a
desperation
of
unceasing
study
in
the
technologies
that
captain
jensen
would
have
helped
him
explore
if
jensen
had
lived
ann
had
read
other
matters
after
the
violin
strings
were
gone
read
and
daydreamed
if
she
wept
and
paul
thought
she
had
she
had
done
it
alone
in
that
pocket
of
a
room
sacred
to
herself
to
the
others
she
was
a
passionately
silent
adolescent
turning
into
a
tiredly
silent
woman
who
made
too
much
point
of
doing
her
own
work
and
asking
for
nothing
yes
ann
was
different
now
the
thin
beauty
of
her
face
vivid
white
under
heavy
black
hair
was
still
too
quiet
but
with
a
troubled
radiance
during
this
long
week
she
had
talked
much
with
dorothy
talk
superficially
inconsequential
but
paul
assumed
it
had
a
meaning
below
words
as
if
ann
had
only
just
realized
probably
without
envy
that
the
brown
girl
was
a
thousand
years
older
in
heart
and
mind
beyond
ann
and
spearman
were
the
six
bowmen
of
the
escort
bodies
bright
with
a
oil
grouped
around
abro
pakriaa
at
a
deferential
distance
the
princess
wore
dorothy
locket
abro
paul
had
learned
was
best
translated
as
princess
or
queen
a
flower
behind
her
ear
caught
sunlight
from
the
early
afternoon
five
others
were
following
paul
women
with
skirts
of
every
tint
but
pakriaa
blue
taller
than
the
men
carrying
spears
with
blades
of
a
white
stone
resembling
quartz
the
men
were
unvaryingly
soft
rounded
in
contour
lacking
the
women
vigor
it
was
plain
merely
from
the
manner
of
abro
pakriaa
and
her
spear
bearers
that
among
this
people
to
be
a
woman
was
to
be
a
leader
and
soldier
no
doubt
a
hunter
and
head
of
the
household
by
virtue
of
size
and
strength
in
muscular
power
a
male
pygmy
was
to
a
female
as
the
weakest
of
earth
women
was
to
the
toughest
male
athlete
these
of
the
bodyguard
were
soldiers
of
a
sort
the
bows
were
small
the
arrows
only
big
darts
the
bowmen
never
spoke
except
meekly
in
response
to
some
patronizing
word
of
the
princess
pakriaa
height
topped
forty
inches
none
of
the
bowmen
was
quite
three
feet
tall
paul
fingers
itched
for
brush
and
palette
they
were
available
in
the
lifeboat
the
fact
that
he
had
not
even
unpacked
them
he
blamed
on
a
preoccupation
with
the
daily
work
needed
for
mere
survival
but
there
was
a
deeper
reason
perhaps
a
fear
of
finding
his
moderate
ability
vanished
if
he
should
once
try
to
hint
with
oil
at
the
welling
profusion
of
color
and
line
that
was
lucifer
now
he
found
himself
trying
to
measure
the
quality
of
pakriaa
rich
copper
against
the
softness
of
leaves
that
were
burnt
umber
malachite
green
saffron
purple
and
he
thought
must
be
recovering
wake
up
ego
and
look
spearman
was
carrying
rifle
and
automatic
paul
had
preferred
to
leave
his
rifle
behind
ann
hating
firearms
had
only
her
knife
abro
pakriaa
had
entered
the
camp
at
noon
her
fourth
visit
in
the
week
her
gloomy
majesty
unchanging
she
had
indicated
that
she
wished
them
to
come
to
her
village
but
dorothy
had
turned
her
ankle
the
evening
before
and
it
still
pained
her
wright
no
doubt
hungering
more
than
any
of
the
others
for
a
sight
of
pakriaa
way
of
living
had
fretted
and
bumbled
and
elected
to
remain
with
dorothy
and
sears
urging
paul
needlessly
to
remember
his
anthropology
sears
sweating
out
a
microsection
of
a
water
insect
from
lake
argo
had
flapped
a
fat
hand
and
boomed
you
be
sure
telephone
damn
it
if
staying
for
dinner
hey
remaining
uneasily
close
to
wright
as
he
did
whenever
the
pygmies
appeared
mijok
had
said
carefully
telephone
word
without
meaning
said
wright
gently
patting
the
huge
arm
noise
word
for
fun
the
attitude
of
pakriaa
people
to
mijok
suggested
the
studious
ignoring
of
an
indecency
they
would
not
harm
the
ugly
animal
their
manner
said
so
long
as
he
was
the
property
of
the
important
sky
people
life
was
generously
abundant
in
this
thinner
forest
things
buzzed
and
flew
paul
noticed
a
few
webs
cunningly
extended
before
burrows
in
the
humus
ann
eyes
glanced
back
brave
and
uncertain
those
girls
are
too
quiet
paul
how
much
they
know
of
our
language
not
much
he
moved
up
to
walk
on
her
other
side
doc
and
i
have
made
only
those
two
efforts
to
swap
languages
a
lot
of
that
time
had
to
be
wasted
on
theirs
a
dead
end
for
us
spearman
grunted
why
they
got
a
civilization
as
doc
says
our
voices
are
wrong
pitch
effects
meaning
for
them
you
noticed
there
no
pitch
difference
between
their
male
and
female
voices
their
language
is
tied
to
one
section
of
the
scale
a
full
octave
of
it
is
above
the
range
of
even
ann
voice
they
can
shape
our
words
though
if
they
willing
basic
english
may
appeal
to
the
princess
when
she
condescends
to
take
it
seriously
they
could
have
picked
up
more
than
we
suspect
they
could
have
been
eavesdropping
outside
the
camp
no
ed
mijok
would
have
known
and
told
us
yeah
fido
can
hardly
speak
freely
in
front
of
him
now
do
think
anything
you
would
want
him
to
hear
paul
i
swear
sometimes
you
worse
than
doc
but
spearman
wanted
to
cancel
the
ill
temper
of
the
remark
and
added
you
know
i
thought
knew
something
about
basic
english
we
all
had
drill
enough
in
it
beats
me
the
things
doc
can
do
with
it
the
man
a
wizard
paul
was
silent
with
unappeased
annoyance
it
was
true
mijok
appeared
to
be
a
natural
student
too
already
far
beyond
basic
english
in
a
week
of
keen
listening
nan
paul
said
how
did
you
like
humming
when
you
were
singing
for
us
yesterday
evening
good
she
flashed
him
an
almost
cheerful
smile
but
when
ann
spoke
of
her
singing
and
in
the
singing
itself
there
was
in
spite
of
her
an
aching
wordless
reminder
of
the
violin
gone
silent
her
voice
was
sweet
but
without
strength
or
resonance
and
she
took
no
ardent
pleasure
in
using
it
her
love
was
the
violin
covered
as
well
as
might
be
in
the
comparative
safety
of
the
lifeboat
waiting
for
a
distant
day
if
the
day
ever
came
sears
had
already
dissected
out
dried
and
oiled
some
long
fibers
of
a
deerlike
animal
in
a
humble
experiment
aimed
chiefly
at
ann
morale
if
the
day
came
there
would
still
be
no
piano
no
answering
of
other
strings
no
splendid
cry
of
brass
crude
wood
winds
perhaps
sometime
yes
he
was
good
said
ann
smiling
organ
point
in
the
tonic
and
right
in
our
own
scale
once
he
even
upped
to
the
dominant
instinct
huh
sounded
good
paul
even
with
you
trying
to
fill
in
the
middle
hell
i
did
think
you
heard
me
spearman
snorted
you
kind
of
stood
out
she
said
because
mijok
was
much
better
on
pitch
my
good
man
it
did
sound
hollow
without
something
to
fill
in
he
was
on
below
the
bass
clef
and
no
fooling
we
seen
other
giants
we
got
something
on
that
this
morning
i
guess
it
was
while
you
were
in
swimming
each
giant
male
has
an
inviolate
hunting
territory
and
they
do
trespass
definite
breeding
season
the
month
before
the
rains
that
was
five
or
maybe
six
changes
ago
mijok
too
clear
on
the
count
does
like
mathematics
much
better
than
i
do
the
women
go
where
they
please
in
small
groups
with
the
children
who
still
need
care
but
i
gather
the
males
are
expected
to
stay
in
their
own
private
grounds
until
the
spearman
wondered
will
the
pygmies
have
a
season
too
doubt
it
probably
like
us
except
that
women
are
the
bosses
the
clothes
suggest
a
continuing
sex
consciousness
the
pygmy
leaders
halted
a
murmuring
explained
itself
as
the
music
of
a
stream
paul
consulted
his
memory
of
the
map
made
from
orbit
photographs
and
of
his
one
solo
exploration
flight
in
the
lifeboat
there
could
be
few
such
flights
the
charlesite
even
with
the
surplus
salvaged
from
the
wrecked
boat
must
be
hoarded
ann
and
ed
had
flown
over
the
lake
on
the
day
after
their
recovery
searching
for
any
sign
of
returning
ed
face
had
been
a
leather
mask
of
grief
and
neither
had
wanted
to
talk
of
it
later
they
explained
the
lake
was
a
profundity
of
secret
blue
a
shelf
of
sand
or
possibly
white
stone
ran
out
some
yards
offshore
under
water
marvelously
clear
and
ended
abruptly
beyond
it
where
must
have
fallen
no
bottom
could
even
be
guessed
at
the
lifeboat
camera
confirmed
the
presence
of
an
abyss
that
would
have
thwarted
the
most
complex
machinery
this
stream
paul
knew
came
from
the
western
hills
flowing
east
and
slightly
north
until
it
entered
the
lake
northeast
of
the
clearing
called
home
another
creek
joined
it
east
of
the
spot
where
they
now
stood
and
pakriaa
village
if
the
parallel
lines
did
represent
its
location
was
not
far
upstream
from
that
junction
worn
boulders
rose
above
noisy
water
the
stream
was
twenty
yards
wide
sluggish
even
here
in
the
shallows
a
steppingstone
crossing
nearly
all
the
rivers
on
the
map
passed
through
jungle
for
most
of
their
length
numberless
smaller
streams
would
be
hidden
from
the
sky
there
was
grassland
for
fifteen
to
twenty
miles
on
the
eastern
side
of
every
range
of
hills
the
prevailing
winds
were
from
the
west
perhaps
a
dryness
in
the
lee
of
the
hills
favored
the
grass
the
broadest
stretch
of
such
open
land
lay
east
of
a
rugged
coastal
range
seventy
miles
to
the
southwest
some
of
the
mountains
in
that
seacoast
formation
were
mighty
enough
to
hold
a
blur
of
snow
at
their
summits
the
base
of
the
coastal
range
was
narrow
hardly
more
than
twenty
miles
from
this
the
peaks
shot
up
with
incredible
sheerness
to
great
heights
of
bare
rock
that
glittered
in
morning
sun
like
black
and
red
glass
this
grandeur
like
nothing
known
on
earth
was
clearly
visible
from
the
camp
above
the
near
hills
especially
at
midday
when
the
mists
were
gone
and
ten
miles
offshore
from
that
dizzy
range
paul
remembered
a
mountainous
island
on
his
solo
exploration
two
days
ago
with
the
lifeboat
panoramic
camera
and
a
head
full
of
puzzled
dreams
he
had
soared
above
it
noting
a
peninsular
strip
of
red
sand
at
its
southern
end
sheltered
mountain
valleys
one
framing
a
jewel
of
lake
in
the
north
was
a
white
beach
where
landing
should
be
easy
and
this
was
protected
by
a
low
headland
of
red
cliffs
running
out
to
the
very
tip
of
the
island
surely
a
place
to
carry
in
the
mind
it
seemed
to
invite
human
living
as
did
no
other
near
region
in
this
continent
of
lucifer
wright
thought
so
he
listened
to
paul
description
and
named
the
island
adelphi
north
of
the
camp
the
range
of
low
western
hills
dwindled
to
rolling
land
and
was
lost
in
a
tremendous
expanse
of
unbroken
jungle
which
ended
only
at
the
shore
of
one
of
the
great
lakes
four
hundred
miles
away
an
inland
sea
fourteen
hundred
miles
long
miles
to
the
south
there
was
that
large
cluster
of
parallel
lines
in
jungle
and
beyond
it
the
forest
gave
way
to
more
open
ground
prairie
red
desert
and
bare
mountains
abro
pakriaa
dipped
her
spear
in
the
water
she
lifted
a
handful
letting
it
trickle
away
while
she
spoke
a
rippling
invocation
then
she
was
lithely
crossing
on
the
stones
after
the
bowmen
the
bottom
was
pale
sand
with
varicolored
pebbles
beyond
the
stream
pakriaa
followed
a
path
a
short
way
and
pressed
into
undergrowth
spearman
grumbled
good
path
for
once
and
we
have
to
path
probably
she
expects
us
to
know
that
hell
it
was
difficult
passage
stooping
on
a
trail
meant
for
little
folk
it
ended
at
a
ditch
six
feet
wide
and
five
deep
the
ditch
made
a
right
angle
both
lines
stretching
away
straightly
as
far
as
the
eye
could
go
the
inner
side
of
the
ditch
was
heaped
with
dry
sticks
and
bundles
of
grass
pakriaa
trilled
orders
to
an
old
woman
with
a
whip
in
charge
of
a
gang
of
four
women
and
three
men
all
totally
naked
they
were
struggling
to
shove
a
movable
bridge
into
place
across
the
ditch
two
logs
bearing
a
mat
of
vines
and
bark
it
was
grunting
work
for
them
and
when
the
end
of
the
bridge
was
in
reach
pakriaa
escort
made
no
motion
to
help
spearman
started
to
paul
interfered
we
lose
face
those
are
slaves
women
tied
together
at
the
ankles
one
of
the
men
a
eunuch
look
at
the
brands
on
their
cheeks
nan
you
the
dominant
sex
try
to
look
more
like
the
president
of
a
women
club
her
finely
modeled
face
had
dignity
enough
he
thought
if
she
could
keep
the
worry
out
of
it
the
old
woman
in
the
black
skirt
bowed
arrogantly
to
pakriaa
the
slaves
cringed
with
the
hating
stare
of
the
trapped
all
were
scarred
and
young
except
for
the
eunuch
who
was
wrinkled
and
flabby
one
female
had
a
recent
chest
wound
the
effort
at
the
bridge
had
made
it
bleed
but
she
ignored
it
paul
saw
spearman
face
settle
into
lines
of
poker
blankness
and
thought
if
to
patience
and
courage
he
could
add
i
hear
you
doc
charity
and
oh
be
quiet
critic
be
trees
had
been
felled
some
time
ago
for
the
stumps
were
rotted
and
the
spacing
was
such
that
the
tops
of
the
trees
left
standing
provided
a
gap
twenty
feet
wide
the
entire
length
of
the
village
there
would
be
two
other
such
gaps
visible
from
the
sky
as
parallel
lines
admitting
full
midday
sunlight
but
shutting
out
the
omasha
nan
let
try
to
learn
something
about
that
big
settlement
in
the
south
the
other
parallel
lines
it
was
surprisingly
easy
to
convey
the
question
to
pakriaa
with
the
help
of
signs
but
her
response
when
she
understood
it
was
a
shrill
snarl
and
shaking
of
her
spear
a
repetition
of
a
name
vestoia
which
seemed
to
be
the
place
and
of
another
name
lantis
a
name
that
caught
in
her
throat
and
made
her
spit
paul
said
we
make
faces
at
the
south
too
and
do
it
fast
it
seemed
to
appease
the
princess
she
even
smiled
the
area
bordering
the
ditch
had
been
left
wild
a
barrier
of
vines
brush
untended
trees
inside
were
orderly
rows
of
plants
some
resembling
beets
some
bushy
another
type
was
rangy
with
blooms
of
startling
emerald
green
near
the
row
of
trees
was
a
path
which
pakriaa
followed
under
the
trees
stood
structures
paul
counted
thirty
well
separated
before
the
princess
left
the
path
and
no
sound
came
from
them
the
trees
were
mostly
of
the
same
species
towers
with
dark
serrated
leaves
blazing
with
scarlet
blossoms
like
the
one
pakriaa
wore
they
were
the
source
of
an
odor
like
frangipani
which
filled
the
village
heady
and
sweet
but
clean
it
was
no
primitive
agriculture
in
this
corridor
rich
darkness
of
earth
was
drawn
up
about
the
plants
there
was
not
a
weed
in
sight
and
there
was
no
trace
of
the
strangling
purple
vines
pakriaa
male
attendants
had
slipped
away
her
spearwomen
accompanied
her
through
an
opening
into
the
next
corridor
where
her
people
were
waiting
for
her
the
soldier
women
in
three
formal
ranks
there
were
about
fifty
in
each
rank
and
here
again
were
dyed
skirts
of
every
color
but
the
regal
blue
that
was
abro
pakriaa
small
faces
maintained
the
flat
indifference
of
the
unliving
copper
they
resembled
pakriaa
intricate
oratory
flowed
over
them
more
than
two
thirds
of
the
stiff
soldiers
were
gashed
with
recent
wounds
ranging
from
scratches
to
lost
hands
or
breasts
or
eyes
some
had
deep
body
wounds
so
ugly
it
was
amazing
that
they
could
stand
upright
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
evidence
of
infection
and
there
was
no
wavering
in
the
lines
while
pakriaa
declaimed
her
right
hand
soared
with
spread
fingers
the
lifeboat
the
name
torothee
occurred
when
it
was
repeated
the
women
swayed
with
unchanging
faces
murmuring
it
in
unison
like
a
breath
of
wind
pakriaa
faced
her
guests
tears
were
not
unknown
to
her
laughter
might
be
she
clenched
and
relaxed
her
hands
the
fourteen
fingers
rising
and
falling
until
paul
lost
count
of
the
motions
more
than
twenty
she
pointed
to
the
soldiers
repeating
the
display
more
slowly
and
only
ten
times
then
one
hand
rose
alone
with
the
thumb
curled
under
paul
muttered
i
think
she
saying
only
are
left
after
the
war
from
maybe
three
hundred
pakriaa
laid
her
spear
at
ann
feet
paul
advised
give
her
your
knife
same
way
pakriaa
took
it
and
placed
it
across
the
spear
and
stood
back
motioning
to
ann
to
do
the
same
when
the
three
had
withdrawn
pakriaa
still
made
impatient
gestures
paul
whispered
ed
you
and
i
are
trifling
males
we
stand
further
back
we
do
like
hell
said
spearman
in
his
throat
we
do
just
the
same
it
nothing
but
ceremony
safety
off
on
my
we
can
handle
anything
stand
back
ed
spearman
stood
back
muttering
at
a
shrill
summons
from
pakriaa
a
shuffling
procession
swung
out
from
the
tree
shadows
these
were
all
men
decrepit
ancient
dirty
some
limped
and
two
had
empty
eye
sockets
and
one
from
a
pathological
fatness
could
barely
waddle
they
were
striped
and
splotched
with
paint
in
elaborate
designs
mostly
of
white
and
yellow
and
their
skins
either
with
dirt
or
age
had
darkened
to
dull
mahogany
they
formed
a
hobbling
circle
around
the
crossed
knife
and
spear
each
grotesque
as
he
passed
the
weapons
spat
on
them
and
scattered
on
them
a
handful
of
earth
until
the
place
became
a
low
mound
as
they
did
this
they
muttered
and
howled
and
squeaked
performing
precise
evolutions
with
twiddling
fingers
they
carried
white
like
clubs
and
shell
ornaments
jangled
on
their
raddled
throats
and
ankles
it
was
on
the
surface
a
simple
ceremony
of
peace
and
friendship
but
the
casual
contempt
of
these
male
witches
cast
a
foulness
over
it
their
sidelong
glances
at
the
strangers
were
poisonous
with
furtive
malignancy
medicine
men
said
paul
under
his
breath
distant
equivalent
of
the
wise
women
in
some
patriarchal
groups
ed
we
stay
on
the
good
side
of
those
loopy
scarecrows
or
it
just
too
bad
and
with
a
certain
hunger
he
studied
the
mask
of
the
man
who
had
never
offered
the
relaxation
of
friendship
wondering
how
far
it
was
physically
possible
for
spearman
to
accept
a
world
in
which
engineering
science
was
the
dream
and
crude
survival
the
reality
the
ceremony
ended
in
a
dribble
of
anticlimax
the
hideous
old
men
merely
shambled
away
from
the
mound
toward
the
shadows
after
a
ceremonial
whoop
that
caused
the
soldiers
to
relax
but
they
did
not
quite
go
they
huddled
and
squatted
under
the
trees
they
stared
they
spat
and
scratched
and
consulted
together
some
of
the
green
eyes
were
veiled
others
were
wide
making
no
effort
to
conceal
a
hatred
compounded
of
jealousy
and
fear
the
fat
monster
nursed
his
obscene
belly
between
scrawny
knees
and
whispered
a
stream
of
information
into
the
close
ear
of
a
witch
with
empty
eye
sockets
and
the
whispering
dark
lips
wore
a
destroying
smile
abro
pakriaa
motioned
her
guests
to
be
seated
before
a
large
building
the
fibers
of
this
structure
were
dyed
the
blue
of
her
skirt
the
soldiers
stalked
about
in
a
show
of
nonchalance
young
men
and
naked
children
had
come
timidly
from
the
houses
the
youngest
children
were
disproportionately
tiny
but
no
bigger
than
house
cats
perhaps
childbirth
for
this
race
was
no
more
than
a
passing
inconvenience
there
were
many
pairs
of
obviously
identical
twins
the
children
stayed
near
the
protective
men
all
but
the
older
girls
who
ventured
somewhat
closer
it
was
a
village
without
laughter
no
scampering
no
horseplay
no
evidence
of
any
tenderness
except
between
the
men
and
the
smallest
children
curiosity
burned
in
all
of
them
but
its
overt
expression
was
limited
to
the
stare
pakriaa
entered
her
blue
building
alone
greeted
by
a
flutter
of
voices
from
within
and
she
was
gone
several
minutes
when
pakriaa
had
seated
her
guests
most
of
the
ancient
painted
males
had
shuffled
across
the
clearing
even
the
fat
horror
whose
walking
must
have
been
pain
to
settle
in
the
shadows
on
the
other
side
and
continue
their
baleful
watching
paul
noticed
that
even
the
women
skipped
clear
to
give
them
and
never
looked
directly
at
them
the
fat
witch
found
a
place
to
squat
that
gave
him
a
clear
view
of
all
three
visitors
as
he
gazed
he
sucked
toothlessly
at
the
knob
of
his
thighbone
club
the
houses
were
lightly
framed
of
wood
with
walls
of
interwoven
fiber
two
thirds
of
the
way
to
the
eaves
joints
bound
and
roofs
thatched
with
the
same
material
a
design
similar
to
what
paul
remembered
from
a
year
spent
in
the
republic
of
oceania
the
modern
citizens
of
that
republic
paul
recollected
still
preferred
the
ancestral
savage
building
pattern
to
stone
or
plastic
it
suited
the
climate
and
the
friendly
unpretentious
way
of
life
but
none
of
the
buildings
here
was
raised
on
supports
snakes
and
vicious
insects
were
evidently
no
problem
there
were
no
domestic
animals
apparently
no
parasites
nor
diseases
except
for
wounds
and
the
dirt
of
the
old
men
the
pygmy
skins
looked
clear
and
healthy
there
were
not
even
any
bad
smells
except
the
mildly
disagreeable
oil
the
males
used
to
anoint
their
bodies
pakriaa
returned
with
her
on
she
had
flowers
behind
both
ears
and
one
tied
by
its
stem
to
dorothy
locket
heavy
white
circles
were
drawn
about
the
lady
eyes
and
breasts
and
navel
blue
bracelets
dangled
at
her
wrists
her
skirt
had
been
replaced
by
an
innocently
unconcealing
fringe
of
shells
similar
to
snail
shells
paul
thought
pakriaa
anklets
of
wooden
beads
were
orange
the
top
of
her
bald
head
was
blue
two
males
with
the
brand
marks
that
must
mean
slavery
followed
her
with
a
seat
a
block
of
wood
cleverly
carved
with
stylized
animal
figures
it
brought
her
face
on
a
level
with
ann
ann
said
politely
why
the
hell
ca
i
be
handsome
too
and
pakriaa
inclined
her
head
a
boy
without
the
slave
brand
came
with
a
wooden
bowl
pakriaa
sipped
the
greenish
liquid
and
offered
the
bowl
to
ann
spearman
rumbled
paul
said
protocol
you
got
ta
nan
but
do
offer
us
any
we
meek
males
ann
swallowed
some
her
eyes
watered
she
repressed
choking
alcoholic
i
do
mean
feasting
followed
a
laborious
hour
of
it
as
food
arrived
without
pause
in
the
hands
of
branded
men
from
the
other
side
of
the
sheltering
trees
wood
smoke
drifted
from
that
direction
and
a
hum
of
voices
all
the
dishes
included
meat
cut
in
tiny
cubes
stewed
fried
boiled
or
smothered
in
unknown
vegetables
only
one
course
was
aggressively
horrid
carrion
swimming
in
peppery
sauce
clearly
a
favorite
of
pakriaa
for
she
belched
wonderfully
and
patted
her
stomach
in
ann
remarked
another
go
at
that
and
i
start
looking
for
another
planet
in
time
even
pakriaa
had
had
enough
she
clapped
her
broad
hands
and
bulging
the
soldiers
formed
a
swaying
stamping
line
spearman
burped
helplessly
all
that
inside
and
they
can
dance
ann
suggested
maybe
it
helps
it
was
an
narrative
dance
vastly
monotonous
a
picture
of
war
some
of
those
most
cruelly
wounded
pranced
into
solo
pantomimes
bragging
of
how
the
injuries
had
been
received
in
climax
a
straw
figure
of
a
woman
was
dragged
to
the
center
of
the
clearing
an
image
carefully
made
brightly
painted
the
face
hideous
the
sexual
features
grossly
exaggerated
shrilling
what
seemed
to
be
a
name
lantis
lantis
the
soldiers
swarmed
on
this
effigy
squealing
stabbing
defiling
tearing
it
into
shreds
which
they
carried
away
as
treasures
or
mementos
when
the
soldier
women
had
finished
in
yawning
exhaustion
a
crowd
of
dainty
men
performed
another
sort
of
dance
purely
an
erotic
show
indicating
that
the
role
of
the
male
was
seductive
half
infantile
submissive
all
the
way
occasionally
a
soldier
pulled
a
dancer
out
of
the
line
slapping
his
face
until
he
stopped
the
squealing
that
was
evidently
required
of
him
and
wandered
away
with
him
but
most
of
the
soldiers
were
too
tired
gorged
or
wounded
to
be
interested
later
some
twenty
soldiers
formed
a
group
and
men
brought
them
babies
to
be
nursed
morsels
of
humanity
quite
silent
far
smaller
in
proportion
than
earth
newborn
the
mothers
arms
were
careful
and
competent
without
tenderness
they
held
the
infants
two
at
a
time
examining
them
shrewdly
often
exchanging
them
with
other
soldiers
there
were
a
few
cooing
demonstrations
of
affection
by
the
men
toward
these
infants
demonstrations
which
the
soldiers
ignored
ann
whispered
i
could
spend
a
lot
of
time
hating
these
little
devils
try
not
to
i
know
paul
but
at
least
they
have
a
civilization
spearman
was
arguing
with
himself
a
potential
technology
that
good
gardening
good
tools
weapons
nan
see
if
you
can
ask
president
to
show
us
the
town
pakriaa
caught
on
swiftly
and
was
delighted
the
first
of
the
areas
contained
all
the
dwelling
houses
dulled
by
the
splendor
of
pakriaa
ann
was
invited
to
enter
this
blue
palace
pakriaa
making
it
clear
that
the
men
must
not
follow
ann
emerged
later
when
it
would
not
be
so
patent
that
she
was
talking
of
pakriaa
house
ann
said
could
make
out
much
detail
dim
and
no
lamps
burning
though
i
think
i
saw
some
clay
things
like
old
roman
lamps
clean
funny
perfume
smells
i
met
her
mother
maybe
incredibly
old
anyway
and
almost
black
their
skin
must
change
color
with
age
dirt
more
likely
spearman
said
not
a
bit
of
it
very
clean
just
a
dry
little
ghost
in
a
fancy
room
of
her
own
with
a
a
male
slave
manicuring
her
toenails
we
seen
any
old
women
out
in
the
open
sheltered
and
reverenced
maybe
paul
said
natural
her
highness
has
a
i
suppose
you
have
to
call
it
a
harem
ten
little
husbands
or
maybe
eleven
what
a
girl
said
spearman
ann
was
amused
though
her
cheeks
were
flaming
i
was
offered
one
hope
you
explained
the
rejection
implied
no
lack
of
merit
tried
to
paul
i
think
i
got
over
the
idea
that
there
was
a
taboo
involved
something
like
that
her
majesty
did
insist
the
ditch
enclosed
the
village
one
side
of
its
square
paralleled
the
river
not
more
than
thirty
feet
from
it
but
making
no
connection
it
would
have
been
easy
to
flood
the
ditch
but
that
was
evidently
not
the
intention
when
ann
conveyed
curiosity
pakriaa
was
astonished
that
anyone
could
be
ignorant
of
its
function
she
said
and
pointed
west
kaksma
convinced
at
last
that
ann
puzzlement
was
genuine
she
drew
a
picture
on
the
earth
with
such
vigorous
art
that
she
herself
feared
the
image
and
drew
back
it
was
a
profile
view
of
an
animal
larger
than
a
rat
with
a
hump
on
the
back
she
had
given
it
a
tiny
eye
and
a
tooth
nothing
like
a
rodent
the
forefoot
was
broad
and
flattened
a
digger
foot
giving
ann
only
a
brief
time
to
study
it
pakriaa
spat
on
the
image
and
wiped
it
out
with
a
violent
heel
she
muttered
an
angry
incantation
and
pointed
to
the
dry
wood
heaped
by
the
ditch
while
her
dancing
fingers
told
of
flames
that
would
defend
the
village
in
the
second
area
were
the
industries
men
not
slaves
glanced
up
from
the
shaping
of
earthenware
vessels
they
had
no
potter
wheel
only
their
hands
but
there
was
a
kiln
of
baked
earth
pakriaa
called
a
favorite
over
hugged
him
and
sent
him
back
with
a
pat
on
the
rump
he
was
quite
old
toothless
and
giggling
they
passed
a
row
of
dye
pots
three
women
braiding
fiber
into
flat
sheets
a
square
of
ground
with
spearheads
arrow
points
other
devices
a
rack
where
deerlike
hides
were
stretched
in
some
curing
process
they
sleep
on
those
ann
said
and
use
for
rugs
the
palace
was
full
of
in
the
rear
of
the
village
was
a
stockade
of
stripped
logs
guarded
by
two
soldier
women
in
the
space
before
it
but
facing
away
from
it
so
that
the
painted
eyes
brooded
over
the
village
stood
a
monstrous
wooden
idol
eight
feet
tall
raised
on
a
low
platform
pakriaa
led
her
guests
before
the
image
and
knelt
it
was
necessary
to
do
the
same
and
ann
imitated
her
gracefully
enough
as
he
knelt
himself
paul
saw
in
a
backward
glance
that
three
gangling
male
witches
had
followed
and
were
observing
every
motion
with
a
rigid
malevolence
it
was
difficult
to
kneel
with
his
back
to
them
spearman
he
hoped
had
not
seen
them
the
idol
was
exaggeratedly
female
with
huge
carnivorous
teeth
indicated
in
white
paint
a
slot
representing
the
left
hand
carried
a
spear
upright
the
right
arm
a
natural
branch
of
the
log
reached
forward
and
spread
into
a
rugged
table
more
wood
had
been
neatly
joined
to
make
the
table
five
feet
long
but
the
whole
gave
the
effect
of
a
swollen
accepting
hand
and
it
was
foul
with
bloodstains
old
and
new
pakriaa
long
murmured
prayer
repeated
the
name
ismar
many
times
at
the
end
she
seemed
satisfied
her
glance
at
ann
was
almost
a
smile
paul
saw
that
the
witches
had
drifted
away
but
the
pressure
of
their
watching
remained
pakriaa
now
took
them
into
the
stockade
it
seemed
to
paul
that
the
guards
were
scarcely
needed
these
naked
men
women
and
children
had
no
danger
in
them
no
life
they
moved
and
functioned
as
if
in
life
walked
spat
scratched
yawned
a
woman
nursed
a
baby
mechanically
a
man
strolled
to
a
trough
in
the
center
of
the
compound
and
ate
a
handful
of
damp
stuff
like
poultry
mash
then
rubbed
his
side
against
the
wooden
edge
as
a
pig
might
beyond
such
elemental
motions
there
was
no
life
a
woman
followed
a
man
for
several
paces
both
flight
and
pursuit
were
dull
unfinished
a
fumbling
response
to
a
sluggish
stimulus
they
paid
no
attention
to
pakriaa
and
the
strangers
the
slack
emptiness
of
their
faces
denied
the
possibility
of
any
thought
more
than
a
flurry
in
response
to
physical
need
they
were
all
some
of
the
females
were
scarred
but
the
wounds
were
old
and
healed
paul
could
see
no
anatomical
differences
between
them
and
their
lively
free
kindred
a
drug
pakriaa
walked
among
them
like
a
farmer
in
a
flock
of
chickens
she
lifted
a
young
girl
who
made
no
effort
to
escape
and
showed
her
to
ann
with
contented
pride
pinching
a
fat
thigh
and
middle
the
child
was
limp
unexcited
mumbling
a
mouthful
of
the
mash
fighting
back
a
retching
ann
muttered
paul
when
can
we
get
out
of
here
abro
pakriaa
caught
the
tone
she
tossed
the
little
girl
away
and
led
them
out
of
the
stockade
she
seemed
hurt
rather
than
angry
disappointed
that
her
important
friends
had
shown
no
admiration
at
this
thriving
industry
the
soldiers
had
gathered
again
in
the
clearing
but
now
there
was
a
waiting
a
tension
with
the
descent
of
twilight
and
a
gloom
a
long
fire
had
been
built
pakriaa
wave
at
her
guests
appeared
to
mean
that
they
should
sit
where
they
pleased
ann
had
not
been
able
to
convey
the
wish
for
an
escort
home
and
pakriaa
mind
was
plainly
filled
with
some
other
graver
concern
having
no
more
time
for
hospitality
pakriaa
entered
her
blue
house
while
she
was
gone
the
soldiers
seated
beyond
the
fire
scattered
handfuls
of
earth
in
synchronized
motions
and
the
witches
grouped
behind
them
set
up
a
monotone
of
chanting
pakriaa
returned
wearing
a
white
skirt
bare
of
all
her
paint
and
jewelry
she
walked
back
and
forth
along
the
line
of
the
fire
praying
until
daylight
was
wholly
gone
at
her
call
old
men
neither
painted
nor
grotesque
carried
out
burdened
hides
and
laid
them
open
beside
the
fire
white
bones
broken
weapons
skirts
loincloths
necklaces
arrows
little
earthen
pots
and
wooden
bowls
many
images
of
clay
the
soldiers
threw
themselves
face
down
their
foreheads
on
their
arms
and
wailed
spearman
voice
was
tortured
with
perplexity
eat
some
mourn
for
others
murder
them
and
love
them
yes
they
human
oh
shut
up
paul
what
do
you
mean
human
these
animals
human
mourning
is
it
listen
to
it
ann
spoke
with
fury
at
least
we
not
cannibals
there
may
still
be
war
back
on
earth
but
after
all
better
to
murder
in
groups
of
a
thousand
at
long
distance
just
listen
to
it
ann
it
was
music
becoming
after
a
time
the
only
thing
existing
under
the
red
moon
and
the
delicate
unceasing
dance
of
blue
fireflies
it
was
the
music
they
had
heard
on
the
first
night
in
the
jungle
a
pouring
forth
of
lamentation
wonder
supplication
whatever
the
spirit
may
feel
in
the
contemplation
of
death
and
its
troubling
counterpart
a
music
that
was
meant
to
go
on
unchanging
as
the
song
of
tree
frogs
for
the
thirteen
hours
of
a
night
of
lucifer
pakriaa
took
no
vocal
part
in
the
ritual
but
sat
alone
guarding
the
relics
of
the
fallen
from
time
to
time
small
man
shapes
carried
new
fuel
to
the
fire
and
there
were
stern
sidelong
glances
from
the
princess
she
had
not
forgotten
her
guests
once
or
twice
paul
caught
himself
dozing
off
dragged
into
a
partial
hypnosis
by
the
endless
lamentation
paul
yes
nan
i
awake
he
saw
spearman
head
jerk
upright
doc
asked
me
yesterday
if
i
would
bear
him
a
child
spearman
arm
sought
for
her
gently
why
bring
that
up
now
think
with
all
this
damn
caterwauling
i
did
get
to
thinking
everything
we
used
to
live
by
it
so
far
away
paul
you
close
to
doc
you
understand
him
i
guess
two
troubled
faces
were
turned
to
paul
in
the
mystery
of
firelight
a
glance
from
pakriaa
conveyed
annoyance
at
the
sound
of
voices
dorothy
told
me
she
wants
sears
to
be
the
father
of
her
second
it
wo
take
her
away
from
me
not
natural
perhaps
but
right
under
the
circumstances
some
of
the
most
important
laws
and
customs
ca
be
started
by
us
they
be
established
by
our
grandchildren
if
we
can
have
them
i
know
but
her
upward
look
at
spearman
worried
face
said
that
her
decision
would
be
made
by
him
no
other
he
must
talk
the
queen
no
like
it
might
have
been
an
hour
later
that
paul
saw
spearman
head
sag
down
on
his
chest
ann
leaned
against
him
but
his
arm
around
her
had
gone
slack
paul
searched
for
the
cause
of
a
sense
of
danger
that
prickled
his
skin
not
the
witches
they
were
grouped
as
before
chanting
a
faint
counterpoint
to
the
soldiers
wailing
no
it
was
ed
spearman
himself
and
paul
came
broad
awake
in
a
certainty
of
what
would
happen
too
late
spearman
head
twitched
and
his
unconscious
throat
let
loose
a
resonant
uncompromising
snore
a
snore
that
had
been
famous
on
the
great
ship
sears
oliphant
had
always
claimed
that
if
only
ed
could
be
harnessed
in
sleep
to
the
reaction
chamber
but
this
was
not
going
to
be
funny
pakriaa
leaped
up
and
shrieked
a
raging
order
the
wailing
ceased
the
soldiers
were
staggering
upright
grabbing
spears
forming
a
circle
of
violence
around
the
guests
before
spearman
could
even
rise
he
gasped
wha
matter
and
ten
pygmy
women
were
hauling
him
away
by
wrists
and
ankles
clear
of
the
ground
paul
shouted
do
fight
ed
keep
quiet
two
soldiers
were
clinging
to
each
of
his
own
arms
there
was
a
ring
of
shivering
spears
around
him
and
others
had
dragged
ann
out
of
sight
but
she
was
screaming
as
if
they
could
understand
do
hurt
him
he
did
do
anything
let
him
go
without
twitching
his
hampered
arms
paul
moved
slowly
against
the
circle
of
spears
they
had
no
quarrel
with
him
he
sensed
but
only
meant
to
restrain
him
it
was
at
least
the
only
action
worth
a
gamble
the
spearwomen
stepped
backward
away
from
him
the
whole
circle
moved
in
slow
motion
following
where
spearman
had
been
carried
through
the
tree
shelter
on
across
the
next
clearing
and
into
the
space
before
the
looming
god
ed
had
not
been
able
to
snatch
his
rifle
he
still
had
his
holstered
automatic
paul
could
not
see
ann
nor
pakriaa
he
could
see
spearman
face
a
concentration
of
craft
and
fighting
fury
the
pygmy
women
lifted
him
and
flung
him
on
the
table
before
the
idol
he
was
ready
he
bounced
like
a
great
cat
gained
his
feet
and
twitched
out
the
pistol
which
banged
once
at
the
huge
blade
of
the
idol
spear
the
stone
blade
crumbled
the
crash
of
the
little
gun
made
his
captors
wince
back
in
shocked
reaction
then
ed
spearman
stooped
grasped
the
reaching
wrist
of
the
idol
and
heaved
upward
with
the
whole
of
his
strength
the
god
swayed
groaned
like
a
thing
of
life
and
toppled
over
squashing
one
of
the
howling
witches
a
blind
one
like
a
red
bug
the
village
dropped
into
total
silence
paul
could
see
ann
now
the
pygmies
had
let
her
go
the
whiteness
of
her
face
had
more
than
terror
in
it
it
had
exultation
a
glory
of
excitement
and
wrath
paul
own
captors
had
lurched
away
his
automatic
had
slipped
into
his
hand
without
conscious
effort
he
searched
in
desperation
for
something
that
might
restore
his
friends
to
steadier
sanity
walk
he
said
walk
do
run
to
the
nearest
exit
the
pygmies
allowed
it
the
god
had
fallen
they
even
stood
back
too
profoundly
dazed
for
any
thought
or
protest
at
the
edge
of
the
village
spearman
jumped
in
the
ditch
reached
for
ann
swung
her
up
on
the
other
side
did
anyone
bring
a
flashlight
oh
i
i
did
said
ann
and
began
to
cry
brought
flashlight
of
gun
paul
stayed
in
the
rear
they
wo
follow
i
think
not
for
a
while
the
stooping
passageway
was
hard
to
find
but
when
they
won
clear
of
it
there
was
the
guiding
sound
of
the
stream
paul
held
the
flashlight
on
the
line
of
stepping
stones
until
the
others
had
crossed
ann
was
still
weeping
in
reaction
we
never
win
it
all
madness
the
ship
everything
all
human
beings
are
crazy
crazy
hush
dear
spearman
said
we
got
out
did
we
now
where
was
the
trail
a
madness
of
groping
blundering
where
there
was
no
path
no
guidance
and
even
their
little
thread
of
light
a
mockery
and
confusion
abruptly
ahead
of
them
there
were
other
lights
then
voices
soft
rumbling
wright
clear
outcry
there
they
are
all
three
mijok
paul
ran
to
him
the
others
dorothy
sears
right
as
rain
son
wright
mumbled
except
dot
been
frantic
about
you
since
we
heard
the
shot
we
left
sears
practically
sitting
on
her
well
figuratively
women
are
odd
you
know
they
do
like
shots
in
the
night
when
the
best
boy
friend
is
out
on
the
tiles
had
a
little
trouble
they
may
come
after
us
do
know
ann
was
quiet
paul
saw
her
white
hands
starfished
on
the
gray
of
mijok
chest
she
said
mijok
i
tired
and
sick
will
you
carry
me
spearman
groaned
ann
what
use
your
head
but
mijok
knelt
at
once
to
make
a
cradle
of
his
arms
and
christopher
wright
said
why
not
why
should
we
need
each
other
mijok
went
ahead
with
her
on
the
blind
trail
paul
heard
spearman
choke
i
would
have
carried
her
it
was
not
meant
to
be
heard
paul
looked
away
hearing
also
the
deep
precision
of
the
giant
voice
exploring
the
mystery
of
words
you
are
my
people
i
will
not
ever
be
much
time
far
from
you
part
two
the
year
one
this
island
is
eden
sears
oliphant
spoke
drowsily
toy
bat
wings
flickered
from
the
woods
crowning
the
hillside
hovered
over
a
pond
in
a
scant
year
of
lucifer
time
seventeen
months
of
the
calendar
of
earth
native
names
had
become
natural
mostly
names
two
changes
ago
in
the
final
jading
month
of
the
rains
the
pygmy
word
kaksma
had
been
only
a
symbol
now
it
woke
the
image
of
a
village
desolate
bones
scraped
and
scarred
the
mind
eye
winced
in
pity
a
sentry
careless
a
bridge
left
in
place
after
dark
thousands
of
ratty
bodies
rustling
down
from
the
wet
hills
over
open
ground
swimming
swollen
streams
finding
the
bridge
before
oil
on
the
rain
water
in
the
ditch
could
be
ignited
small
bodies
not
swift
leaping
or
humping
along
like
furry
worms
sniffing
squeaking
their
stabbing
teeth
dark
with
the
blood
of
any
flesh
that
moved
the
northernmost
of
the
villages
allied
with
pakriaa
had
already
returned
to
jungle
but
here
ten
miles
offshore
from
the
coastal
range
no
kaksmas
lived
sears
and
paul
in
two
days
of
study
on
this
second
visit
had
established
that
no
wide
wings
lurked
in
the
sky
the
hilly
island
had
no
large
meadows
where
omasha
could
hunt
three
giants
had
been
flown
to
the
island
a
month
ago
the
girl
arek
her
mother
muson
and
old
rak
they
said
it
was
a
place
of
calm
their
soft
talk
could
be
heard
up
the
slope
where
a
log
building
was
growing
paul
stretched
lean
and
comfortable
on
the
grass
glad
to
be
alone
for
a
while
with
this
least
demanding
of
his
friends
sears
was
fatter
but
hardened
a
round
block
of
man
with
a
coarse
black
beard
kindness
of
brown
eyes
unaltered
christopher
wright
waiting
at
the
fortress
by
lake
argo
and
no
doubt
frantic
for
word
of
this
exploration
had
let
his
beard
grow
too
sandy
gray
spearman
and
paul
had
stayed
with
soap
made
from
fat
and
wood
ashes
the
others
must
come
here
paul
i
suppose
chris
wo
consent
till
pakriaa
agrees
damn
you
think
she
could
see
it
she
knows
her
enemies
fear
the
ocean
as
she
does
lantis
army
would
never
chase
after
us
in
their
lake
boats
wait
a
minute
jocko
lantis
is
no
proposition
damn
napoleon
with
four
teats
and
a
grass
skirt
lookee
that
settlement
south
of
lake
argo
is
thirty
miles
long
equivalent
of
two
hundred
villages
to
pakriaa
six
say
twenty
thousand
warriors
who
got
their
pride
hurt
a
year
ago
when
the
crash
of
swamped
their
fleet
and
scared
the
pants
off
have
replaced
the
fleet
they
come
overland
too
lantis
queen
of
the
world
if
they
do
sears
heavy
voice
had
the
tremor
that
he
himself
hated
the
firearms
should
be
at
least
one
ace
in
the
hole
ye
es
ed
pistol
helped
in
our
one
bad
scrape
with
pakriaa
herself
but
it
was
his
smashing
the
idol
that
stalled
not
the
gun
poor
little
abro
pakriaa
sears
spoke
with
tenderness
if
ever
a
lady
was
pulled
seven
ways
from
sunday
wants
our
way
of
life
want
it
wants
to
grasp
chris
ethics
does
want
to
afraid
of
strength
and
aggressiveness
admires
too
oh
my
yes
tries
to
believe
the
god
ismar
died
or
never
lived
but
ca
quite
and
ca
understand
why
our
women
are
gentle
dorothy
anyway
nan
toughening
up
is
conscious
effort
paul
superficial
made
herself
hunt
shoot
well
act
hard
because
her
brain
tells
her
she
should
if
we
could
only
find
something
to
restring
her
violin
i
think
she
given
up
hope
of
it
nothing
i
found
so
far
has
been
any
good
she
does
see
that
dorothy
does
more
for
us
by
remaining
the
person
she
always
was
you
know
when
i
go
alone
to
village
i
just
set
even
the
witches
have
got
used
to
me
not
that
they
would
gut
me
if
they
could
jocko
paul
looked
away
you
told
me
once
you
were
scared
all
the
time
when
you
go
there
alone
or
when
you
tame
the
olifants
for
that
matter
are
you
sort
of
grasping
the
nettle
and
does
it
work
do
ask
me
friend
because
i
do
exactly
know
i
was
never
a
brave
man
brown
eyes
misted
in
what
was
partly
laughter
oy
the
witches
there
the
big
enemy
in
the
battle
for
pakriaa
mind
chris
may
claim
they
are
real
witch
doctors
just
advisers
magicians
i
not
so
sure
priests
of
ismar
and
when
ed
clobbered
the
idol
pakriaa
did
consider
having
all
burned
alive
point
is
she
did
do
it
they
gnaw
away
in
the
dark
at
all
we
try
to
teach
her
that
proposed
bonfire
by
the
way
is
gossip
passed
on
to
me
in
confidence
by
abara
there
a
dear
little
man
ai
he
though
smiling
into
late
sky
paul
envisaged
the
wizened
red
midget
riding
the
white
monsters
that
sears
had
tamed
and
insisted
on
naming
a
painting
might
grow
out
of
that
he
thought
squat
coppery
lump
astride
of
massive
white
it
might
if
the
desire
to
paint
should
ever
wake
again
and
be
as
strong
as
it
once
was
on
when
his
mind
eye
could
remember
earth
without
distortion
abara
popeyed
and
potbellied
a
favorite
in
harem
had
been
commissioned
by
her
as
a
student
and
at
the
lakeside
camp
sears
had
not
only
adopted
him
as
an
olifant
trainer
but
suspected
him
of
furtively
possessing
a
sense
of
humor
well
the
giants
lantis
will
always
have
thought
of
them
as
wild
animals
sears
paul
rolled
over
and
pressed
his
face
in
the
grass
can
we
ask
or
even
permit
the
giants
to
tangle
in
a
pygmy
war
ah
it
tormenting
chris
too
ever
since
lantis
sent
that
ultimatum
he
snarled
in
his
beard
thirty
fat
meat
slaves
every
two
months
there
politics
for
you
dirtiest
way
she
could
answer
challenge
to
personal
combat
and
the
automatic
refusal
makes
an
excuse
to
come
and
clean
up
sounds
like
home
mijok
wants
to
help
fight
says
he
does
it
still
our
responsibility
paul
sat
up
his
eyes
kept
returning
to
the
towering
courage
of
the
trees
brave
as
any
cathedral
spire
scarcely
one
was
free
from
the
clutch
of
the
vine
as
for
moving
here
to
the
island
pak
sees
it
but
the
idea
too
new
you
just
do
pull
up
stakes
venture
on
the
big
water
crossing
forbidden
kaksma
country
sears
chewed
a
grass
blade
anyway
we
got
to
bring
dorothy
and
the
baby
here
and
ann
dorothy
wo
fuss
will
she
son
since
there
helen
no
she
wo
i
still
dream
sometimes
as
i
did
during
her
first
pregnancy
things
shapes
trying
to
pull
her
away
or
she
where
i
ca
find
her
ca
push
through
the
leaves
she
told
me
it
something
else
that
made
you
blue
lately
no
sears
watched
him
yes
want
to
start
back
tomorrow
might
as
well
we
learned
all
we
need
mm
second
thoughts
about
the
daddy
of
dorothy
second
no
no
we
settled
that
she
proud
to
be
carrying
it
good
genetics
could
be
damn
bad
psychology
no
jocko
do
think
that
she
close
to
me
as
ever
sears
waited
and
spoke
softly
new
york
late
on
a
rainy
night
a
few
car
lights
moving
reflections
like
golden
fish
orange
paintbrush
in
new
hampshire
meadows
we
better
stop
we
better
i
want
boat
whistles
floating
city
coming
out
of
the
fog
call
it
a
wound
and
look
across
the
channel
paul
saw
it
presently
a
cliff
formation
in
the
coastal
range
made
a
brow
nose
and
chin
below
this
rounded
rock
could
be
a
shoulder
straining
in
heroic
effort
then
tumbled
reality
of
must
supply
whatever
held
the
figure
in
bondage
yes
he
looks
west
past
us
at
the
sun
why
no
paul
i
think
he
looks
west
of
the
sun
a
girl
wandered
down
from
the
woods
i
got
tired
arek
had
lived
years
she
was
seven
feet
tall
not
yet
adolescent
but
near
it
in
the
next
ten
months
away
she
might
take
adult
part
in
the
frenzy
of
love
if
her
body
demanded
it
if
not
she
would
go
apart
with
the
other
children
whose
play
also
became
innocently
erotic
at
that
time
and
help
care
for
the
youngest
sears
grinned
as
she
sat
down
with
them
tired
or
lazy
both
you
charins
are
never
lazy
enough
the
name
charin
paul
thought
was
almost
natural
now
a
pygmy
word
for
halfway
intended
by
pakriaa
merely
to
convey
that
wright
and
his
breed
were
halfway
in
size
between
her
people
and
the
giants
but
wright
took
sardonic
satisfaction
in
it
as
a
generic
name
work
and
loafing
are
both
good
why
can
ed
spearman
never
sit
still
in
the
sun
or
maybe
i
like
to
talk
too
much
never
sears
chuckled
well
his
best
pleasure
is
in
action
maybe
it
the
technician
in
him
he
must
always
be
doing
something
like
always
waking
never
sleeping
she
sprawled
in
comfort
her
broad
hands
plucked
grass
scattered
it
over
the
furry
softness
of
her
four
breasts
green
rain
i
want
to
stay
on
this
island
will
they
come
we
hope
so
mijok
will
as
soon
as
doc
does
she
sighed
mijok
is
a
beautiful
male
i
think
i
take
him
for
my
first
when
i
ready
and
soon
the
pretty
boat
will
be
no
more
good
it
sad
we
ca
make
another
tell
me
again
about
captain
jensen
he
was
as
tall
as
me
he
had
hair
on
his
head
red
like
my
fur
he
spoke
like
storm
wind
said
paul
supplying
the
wanted
note
in
a
favorite
fairy
tale
remembering
a
brother
on
earth
who
was
perhaps
not
dead
hear
the
ocean
arek
whispered
paul
could
hardly
separate
the
sound
from
the
mutter
of
the
pond
outlet
this
ridge
of
high
ground
ended
short
of
the
island
northern
limit
a
white
beach
where
the
lifeboat
was
shaded
from
late
sun
faced
the
mainland
west
of
the
beach
a
red
stone
cliff
ran
to
the
tip
of
the
island
shouldering
away
the
sea
wind
out
of
the
west
allowed
no
soil
to
gather
on
it
now
and
then
a
rainbow
flashed
and
died
above
the
rock
when
a
wave
of
uncommon
grandeur
spent
itself
in
a
tower
of
foam
hear
what
it
says
will
try
why
must
the
others
wait
to
come
here
pakriaa
people
are
not
ready
oh
sears
arek
laughed
unhappily
and
sat
up
i
think
of
how
my
mother
taught
me
the
three
terrors
she
took
me
to
the
hills
beat
two
stones
before
a
burrow
till
one
blundered
out
maddened
afraid
of
nothing
but
the
light
she
crushed
it
made
me
smell
it
i
was
sick
then
we
fled
i
think
of
how
she
flung
an
carcass
into
meadow
grass
so
the
omasha
came
she
wounded
one
with
a
stone
made
me
watch
while
the
others
tore
it
apart
later
still
when
i
could
run
fast
ah
through
night
to
a
village
of
the
red
bald
please
dear
pygmies
that
a
name
they
accept
i
sorry
sears
yes
we
hid
in
the
dark
waited
until
a
sentry
moved
careless
it
was
wrong
you
shown
us
how
such
things
are
wrong
and
memory
someone
talking
behind
you
out
of
the
big
dark
the
laws
we
agreed
on
i
do
honor
them
she
said
gently
the
law
against
murder
was
my
first
writing
lesson
but
what
if
pakriaa
tribe
they
slower
sears
said
in
distress
and
the
distress
would
be
as
much
a
message
to
arek
as
any
words
there
was
no
hiding
the
heart
from
these
people
green
eyes
and
black
ears
missed
no
smallest
nuance
when
will
they
know
they
must
not
dig
pits
with
poisoned
stakes
but
pakriaa
tribe
do
do
that
now
do
they
arek
admitted
i
suppose
not
but
the
six
other
villages
five
dear
the
kaksmas
and
only
two
months
ago
arek
she
stared
at
paul
with
shock
i
almost
forgotten
but
they
do
still
hate
us
the
day
before
you
flew
us
here
paul
i
met
pakriaa
and
two
of
her
soldiers
in
the
woods
i
gave
them
the
greeting
oh
if
one
of
you
had
been
there
she
would
have
answered
it
would
the
island
be
better
without
them
some
of
like
them
even
dorothy
only
tries
to
like
them
since
the
baby
was
born
paul
she
shrinks
when
they
come
to
the
fortress
they
know
it
but
i
do
dimly
paul
had
known
it
known
also
that
it
was
a
thing
dorothy
would
consciously
reject
time
arek
you
live
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
or
better
more
than
three
pygmy
lifetimes
you
see
them
change
speaking
almost
like
a
charin
arek
said
they
better
they
strolled
up
the
hill
the
other
giants
labor
had
ceased
the
building
was
a
sturdy
oblong
intended
as
storehouse
and
temporary
communal
dwelling
for
them
all
including
wright
hoped
some
of
pakriaa
people
rafters
were
not
yet
in
place
for
that
rak
needed
the
strength
of
another
like
himself
chubby
muson
tired
easily
someday
a
road
would
climb
from
the
beach
traversing
the
ridge
which
was
the
backbone
of
the
northern
half
of
the
island
here
where
spring
water
filled
the
pond
and
rushed
on
down
to
carve
a
small
harbor
below
the
beach
would
be
jensen
city
and
the
three
races
of
lucifer
would
learn
to
live
there
in
good
will
and
pleasure
under
a
government
of
laws
so
wright
said
peering
at
photographs
teasing
his
gray
beard
tapping
thin
fingers
on
the
map
drawn
on
the
paper
of
earth
on
the
new
maps
of
whitebark
paul
could
see
it
too
sometimes
glimpse
the
houses
gardens
open
places
south
of
the
pond
a
wheat
field
for
on
lucifer
the
wheat
of
earth
grew
to
four
feet
and
bore
richly
near
the
field
perhaps
the
house
for
dorothy
and
himself
with
no
doorway
lower
than
ten
feet
at
other
times
he
could
see
only
defeat
the
arrogance
and
blind
drive
of
genus
species
beating
against
the
indifference
of
nature
the
resentment
of
other
life
he
could
see
his
people
destroyed
by
accident
or
anger
the
giant
friends
adrift
with
only
hints
of
the
new
life
and
spoiled
for
the
old
then
he
would
stop
trying
to
foresee
and
would
make
his
mind
ear
listen

the
the
walls
were
eleven
feet
in
height
rak
and
muson
rested
on
the
coolness
of
bare
ground
within
rak
pointed
at
the
top
of
the
walls
where
rafters
would
rest
slow
he
said
and
good
rak
could
not
be
sure
how
old
he
was
when
mijok
had
first
persuaded
him
to
the
camp
ten
months
ago
rak
had
won
his
english
with
the
grave
precision
of
a
mason
selecting
fieldstone
his
language
had
none
of
the
flexibility
and
scope
that
mijok
and
others
had
achieved
but
it
served
him
after
absorbing
basic
arithmetic
rak
had
deliberated
on
the
problem
of
his
age
squatting
at
the
gate
of
the
stone
fortress
by
lake
argo
spreading
out
rows
of
colored
pebbles
to
indicate
years
rainy
seasons
episodes
of
hunting
or
fear
or
passion
too
keen
to
forget
at
last
he
had
come
up
with
the
figure
of
years
but
he
said
there
are
two
times
in
here
he
patted
an
ancient
scar
on
his
belly
and
there
he
pointed
at
the
red
crescent
moon

arek
said
muson
bubbled
and
shadowboxed
with
her
daughter
muson
would
laugh
at
anything
the
flutter
of
a
leaf
a
breath
of
breeze
on
her
fur
paul
followed
to
help
arek
trim
the
carcass
of
an
asonis
killed
the
night
before
hornless
fat
the
bovine
animal
was
abundant
on
the
island
its
one
enemy
here
was
what
arek
called
a
catlike
carnivore
the
size
of
a
lynx
which
could
tackle
only
the
young
asonis
or
feeble
stragglers
rak
hunted
in
the
old
way
bow
club
spear
even
rifle
had
been
explained
to
him
but
the
stalk
the
single
rush
and
leap
the
grasp
of
a
muzzle
and
backward
jerk
that
snapped
the
neck
before
the
prey
could
even
struggle
these
were
rak
way
still
in
the
old
life
rak
age
would
have
led
him
eventually
to
a
few
dim
years
with
a
band
of
women
who
would
have
fed
him
until
he
chose
to
wander
into
deep
jungle
preventing
any
from
following
when
far
away
he
would
have
sat
in
the
shadows
to
wait
for
starvation
or
the
black
marsh
reptiles
or
a
great
mainland
cat
which
never
attacked
a
giant
in
the
prime
of
strength
rak
would
have
taken
no
harm
from
the
young
men
in
this
weakness
his
own
territory
would
have
been
inviolate
and
he
would
have
joined
the
women
in
a
taciturn
farewell
to
life
only
when
teeth
and
arms
had
failed
we
gentle
people
mijok
said
puzzled
at
it
himself
in
the
we
only
play
at
fighting
it
not
like
what
we
see
the
other
creatures
do
at
that
time
how
could
one
a
woman
do
i
possess
the
wind
because
i
like
to
run
against
the
touch
of
it
the
meat
hung
from
a
makeshift
tripod
arek
jumped
back
startled
as
a
furry
thing
scampered
down
it
was
like
a
kinkajou
except
for
the
hump
on
the
back
a
true
hindbrain
in
the
spine
sears
had
long
ago
verified
that
guess
of
wright
little
rascal
paul
said
tame
it
what
arek
was
bewildered
do
what
do
these
live
on
the
mainland
i
never
saw
one
till
i
came
here
too
small
to
eat
tame
it
watch
paul
tossed
a
bit
of
meat
the
visitor
chatter
changed
to
a
whistling
whine
it
elongated
itself
grabbed
sat
back
on
stubby
hind
legs
to
eat
in
clever
paws
it
washed
itself
with
a
pertness
arek
chuckled
examining
the
idea
and
went
on
with
her
work
she
had
become
a
hypercritical
cook
under
dorothy
guidance
jocko
biologist
stand
by
i
propose
to
name
an
animile
genus
species
genus
kink
did
not
retreat
at
quiet
approach
but
wriggled
a
black
nose
rak
asked
in
solemn
curiosity
for
what
is
it
good
to
make
us
laugh
paul
said
so
long
as
we
kind
to
it
ah
rak
moved
his
fingers
to
aid
the
patient
mill
of
his
mind
said
muson
who
already
understood
she
shook
all
over
come
it
would
not
yet
but
muson
could
be
patient
too
sears
whispered
in
his
beard
less
homesick
yes
after
the
meal
arek
wanted
paul
to
come
out
on
the
cliffs
though
there
seemed
no
danger
from
the
omasha
she
carried
a
long
stick
and
paul
took
his
pistol
the
slope
leveled
out
to
the
bare
rock
of
the
headland
the
ocean
voice
was
the
humming
of
a
thousand
giants
the
way
was
easy
with
no
crevasses
no
peril
while
the
wind
was
mild
arek
had
often
been
out
here
alone
yesterday
paul
had
seen
her
standing
for
an
hour
watching
the
west
where
unbroken
water
met
a
horizon
in
her
earlier
years
there
might
have
been
dim
mention
of
the
sea
by
her
almost
wordless
people
but
no
true
knowledge
the
mainland
coast
was
steaming
jungle
or
tidal
marsh
and
shut
away
by
the
kaksma
hills
paul
wondered
what
member
of
his
race
could
stand
for
an
hour
in
contemplation
like
a
thinking
tree
not
shifting
a
foot
nor
raising
an
arm
paul
why
did
you
leave
earth
arek
patted
the
rock
beside
her
below
the
troubled
water
laughed
endlessly
defeated
and
returning
cloud
fantasies
gathered
below
a
lucid
green
and
the
wind
was
a
friend
i
have
doubted
sometimes
whether
we
ought
to
have
done
so
that
was
my
meaning
we
love
you
did
you
know
but
wondered
what
sent
you
away
from
such
a
place
ann
says
it
was
beautiful
a
drive
of
restlessness
we
took
boundaries
as
a
challenge
i
used
to
think
that
a
great
virtue
now
i
call
it
neither
good
nor
evil
i
think
it
is
good
everywhere
we
carry
good
evil
what
you
do
here
is
good
you
teach
us
you
do
kind
things
we
can
be
bad
but
for
doc
wright
and
his
dreams
that
ed
spearman
finds
so
impractical
we
have
done
you
harm
helpless
at
her
innocence
paul
saw
she
did
not
believe
him
on
earth
we
fought
each
other
we
hunted
for
lies
to
make
ourselves
feel
big
we
created
great
institutions
built
on
vanity
tickling
lies
imperialism
communism
most
of
the
isms
you
find
so
puzzling
when
we
talk
of
earth
history
the
anger
of
charins
rarely
focused
itself
on
the
actual
causes
of
unhappiness
or
injustice
instead
we
hunted
for
scapegoats
easy
solutions
we
would
study
ourselves
always
we
itched
for
something
external
to
take
the
blame
for
our
own
follies
and
crimes
i
do
understand
as
if
you
stumbled
on
a
root
arek
and
then
banged
your
fist
on
the
tree
that
grew
it
to
blame
it
for
your
own
clumsiness
but
paul
only
a
very
small
child
would
act
like
that
darling
let
watch
the
sunset
she
felt
his
pain
touched
his
knee
and
was
silent
until
he
said
a
poor
naughty
child
there
was
a
thing
ed
spearman
said
to
me
what
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
i
never
gone
to
pakriaa
village
you
know
even
mijok
wo
go
there
except
with
one
of
you
i
asked
ed
if
pakriaa
still
kept
that
stockade
for
drugging
and
fattening
prisoners
in
spite
of
her
agreeing
to
the
laws
he
said
yes
she
did
i
said
it
was
not
right
i
said
we
made
a
law
against
slavery
too
he
said
it
baby
one
thing
at
a
time
i
am
not
a
baby
how
can
the
laws
govern
us
unless
all
obey
them
ed
meant
no
harm
arek
he
only
meant
it
does
take
time
the
pygmies
have
more
to
unlearn
you
started
clean
and
well
with
the
army
of
lantis
likely
to
come
back
at
any
time
we
ca
afford
yet
it
seemed
natural
that
this
giant
child
who
had
herself
done
murder
in
the
old
days
should
answer
his
troubled
evasions
not
only
with
reproach
but
with
command
if
the
laws
are
to
govern
us
they
must
be
respected
by
everyone
i
wish
i
had
gone
to
that
village
and
torn
down
the
stockade
with
my
hands
and
they
would
have
killed
you
with
a
hundred
spears
and
people
would
hate
us
forever
learning
nothing
but
more
hatred
arek
cried
a
little
rubbing
at
the
unfamiliar
wetness
maybe
i
begin
to
see
how
difficult
the
sun
going
but
they
sat
quietly
in
the
warm
and
undemanding
wind
until
the
first
sapphire
glint
of
fireflies
dotted
the
slope
where
jensen
city
might
one
day
shine
arek
stood
reaching
down
an
affectionate
hand
paul
glanced
down
at
snow
on
the
highest
peak
of
the
coastal
range
thirteen
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
prairie
spread
for
thirty
miles
east
of
its
base
then
came
a
region
of
forest
and
small
lakes
fed
by
the
outlet
of
lake
argo
which
was
the
core
of
the
empire
of
lantis
queen
of
the
world
pakriaa
information
on
lantis
was
a
murky
blend
of
truth
and
fantasy
lantis
claimed
birth
from
pakriaa
had
different
theories
originally
ruler
of
a
single
village
lantis
consolidated
by
conquest
instead
of
annihilating
defeated
villages
she
took
their
populations
captive
sorting
out
three
categories
potential
followers
slave
laborers
and
meat
many
in
the
first
class
became
fanatically
converted
those
in
the
second
provided
a
year
or
so
of
work
before
dying
of
whippings
and
other
abuse
captives
of
the
third
class
were
forced
to
eat
the
weed
that
numbed
the
brain
and
were
bled
out
at
the
right
stage
of
fatness
in
fifteen
years
one
riverside
village
had
swollen
to
a
city
of
sixty
thousand
fed
by
expeditions
far
to
the
east
and
lantis
named
her
city
vestoia
country
of
freedom
and
joy
got
anything
new
in
the
sears
groaned
there
more
boats
above
the
falls
the
boats
they
knew
were
broad
canoes
roofed
like
sampans
against
the
omasha
but
with
no
sail
not
moving
are
they
no
anchored
maybe
sears
mopped
his
round
face
without
the
telescope
paul
could
see
brownness
on
the
water
of
lake
argo
southern
end
near
the
spot
where
the
outlet
tumbled
over
a
high
falls
to
a
smaller
lake
it
meant
that
hundreds
more
must
have
been
portaged
past
the
falls
from
vestoia
during
his
two
days
on
the
island
the
fifty
flowing
miles
became
a
pain
of
delay
sears
too
would
be
aching
for
the
gray
square
of
their
fortress
to
claim
the
eye
in
the
north
touched
by
early
sunlight
a
brave
structure
twelve
feet
high
fifty
square
built
of
split
stone
by
the
labor
of
giant
friends
outside
it
ran
a
moat
twenty
feet
wide
ten
deep
with
a
drawbridge
of
logs
bark
matting
ropes
the
bottom
flooded
with
lake
water
there
was
room
within
for
living
quarters
a
supply
of
smoked
meat
dried
vegetables
lantis
understood
scaling
ladders
pakriaa
said
lantis
had
patience
for
a
siege
there
was
no
defense
pakriaa
said
in
these
measures
the
only
defense
was
to
attack
to
retreat
and
attack
again
it
had
always
been
so
in
the
old
wars
it
was
still
so
with
this
lantis
and
her
this
bastard
begotten
of
a
red
worm
and
inkar
goddess
of
kaksmas
it
would
always
be
so
at
least
until
paul
remembered
dorothy
cherishing
helen
at
her
brown
breast
asking
neutrally
until
what
abro
pakriaa
pakriaa
had
studied
the
giants
walls
with
contempt
until
i
shame
this
worm
spawn
lantis
into
meeting
me
alone
she
must
respect
custom
her
first
answer
is
a
what
word
rejection
because
she
has
fear
i
have
sent
a
second
challenge
she
will
meet
me
or
her
own
people
will
condemn
her
i
will
pin
her
belly
to
the
ground
her
government
will
be
mine
there
had
been
no
mistaking
it
for
the
first
time
in
the
year
since
the
idol
of
ismar
fell
and
was
not
restored
pakriaa
was
making
vast
decisions
wholly
her
own
with
only
perfunctory
interest
in
what
the
charins
might
think
in
her
wrath
against
the
mighty
soldier
ruler
in
the
south
there
was
natural
grief
at
the
outrages
of
past
years
but
something
else
too
her
red
face
glaring
southward
said
has
what
i
desire
she
is
doing
what
i
would
pakriaa
had
finished
her
answer
quietly
it
is
who
will
be
queen
of
the
world
three
days
ago
it
could
have
been
a
mistake
to
leave
the
camp
at
all
now
a
streak
of
sunshine
on
gray
at
the
end
of
familiar
meadow
with
fuel
for
only
a
few
more
flights
paul
knew
he
had
never
made
a
better
landing
the
drawbridge
was
down
dorothy
ran
to
meet
him
sears
was
shouting
chris
it
perfect
no
kaksmas
everything
paul
said
it
was
paul
stammered
you
look
like
a
million
dollars
dollars
what
those
i
forget
what
news
your
funny
mouth
is
tickling
my
ear
that
is
news
dope
helen
full
of
the
best
gurgles
come
and
see
he
thought
do
i
tell
her
of
the
boats
the
hive
of
savage
but
sears
was
already
talking
of
it
wright
had
no
smile
for
paul
only
a
warm
stare
and
pressure
of
the
hand
paul
asked
where
ed
mijok
and
the
boys
ann
looked
up
from
cutting
a
square
of
hide
she
had
not
come
to
meet
them
ann
way
nowadays
one
mind
insisted
does
mean
ed
hunting
should
have
been
back
last
night
dorothy
added
mijok
off
missionarying
with
elis
and
surok
they
took
blondie
lisson
i
mean
moral
support
wright
was
sears
if
it
were
only
tribe
but
not
fuel
enough
to
fly
all
the
giants
over
we
can
not
abandon
then
let
get
the
women
there
and
the
rest
of
us
go
overland
ann
said
i
going
overland
wright
muttered
damn
it
nancy
sears
patted
her
shoulder
and
ignored
her
speech
as
she
ignored
the
touch
chris
i
labored
myself
over
that
damn
knotty
little
brain
of
pakriaa
she
ca
see
things
our
way
we
need
a
hundred
years
the
conference
lengthened
into
the
morning
sometimes
it
seemed
to
paul
that
his
teacher
stubbornness
degenerated
into
the
obsession
of
a
man
who
wo
leave
a
blazing
house
until
the
rugs
are
saved
wright
longed
for
the
island
which
he
had
seen
only
in
photographs
there
had
always
been
some
compelling
reason
why
he
must
stay
by
the
fortress
if
only
to
hoe
voracious
weeds
out
of
the
gardens
yet
to
wright
it
was
unthinkable
that
the
island
community
should
start
without
the
pygmies
he
returned
to
it
with
haggard
insistence
i
know
i
ca
actually
like
pakriaa
she
got
a
mind
like
a
greased
eel
but
we
made
a
beginning
they
speak
our
tongue
well
a
people
intelligent
as
they
are
paul
thought
not
lucifer
that
aged
him
it
us
we
are
not
big
aloud
he
suggested
doc
ca
we
make
a
start
without
them
and
just
keep
the
door
open
bring
them
in
when
we
stronger
ourselves
oh
son
if
we
desert
pak
now
she
finished
lantis
will
go
over
her
like
a
tide
we
might
just
turn
that
tide
if
not
we
be
ready
to
help
her
escape
with
whatever
left
well
at
least
we
agree
on
this
helen
and
the
women
must
go
to
the
island
at
once
tomorrow
dorothy
choked
if
the
boats
have
started
yet
all
right
dear
tomorrow
and
one
man
should
go
with
them
you
paul
said
you
wright
said
inexorably
no
his
stare
groped
at
sears
oliphant
sears
was
nakedly
desperate
chris
i
beg
of
you
you
must
not
ask
me
to
go
away
from
this
battle
he
was
sweating
white
i
am
in
a
sense
a
religious
man
the
armageddon
within
your
own
phrase
please
understand
without
my
saying
any
more
do
ask
me
to
go
ed
wo
go
paul
him
with
sears
inner
torments
and
ed
arrogance
no
doc
ann
bryan
said
i
staying
for
the
show
dorothy
lowered
her
cheek
to
the
brown
fuzz
of
helen
head
the
baby
absurd
square
of
palm
found
paul
finger
helen
was
almost
eight
months
old
lucifer
months
the
new
life
in
dorothy
had
been
conceived
in
the
last
month
of
the
rains
dorothy
said
i
going
nancy
with
helen
as
a
valuable
brood
mare
i
ca
afford
heroism
neither
can
you
the
giant
women
crossed
the
bridge
they
had
lingered
outside
knowing
the
charins
needed
to
talk
alone
ann
said
i
heard
the
argument
i
not
pregnant
yet
i
learned
to
shoot
damn
well
wright
asked
will
you
abide
by
a
vote
when
ed
gets
back
ann
pushed
her
fingers
into
black
hair
cut
short
as
a
man
i
suppose
i
must
if
no
men
get
to
the
island
how
do
two
women
and
a
girl
child
increase
and
multiply
or
should
i
ask
wright
mumbled
inadequately
we
reach
the
island
ann
said
then
you
already
see
it
as
a
retreat
wright
was
silent
he
tried
to
smile
with
confidence
at
the
giant
women
and
children
who
were
sober
with
reflected
unhappiness
all
but
dunin
who
trotted
to
paul
and
hugged
him
with
her
large
arms
and
announced
i
learned
six
words
while
you
were
gone
hi
listen
that
here
and
here
that
happens
in
the
brain
when
it
quiet
that
these
and
that
ooph
like
that
that
a
breath
with
nobody
blowing
it
i
forgotten
six
dorothy
murmured
tem
tem
dunin
hopped
up
and
down
big
breeze
that
perfect
said
paul
perfect
before
the
rainy
season
had
made
travel
on
the
sodden
gasping
ground
too
miserable
mijok
had
explored
a
half
circle
of
territory
forty
miles
in
radius
east
of
the
hills
for
others
who
might
be
willing
to
learn
new
ways
it
was
slow
work
often
discouraging
he
had
located
two
bands
of
women
and
children
twenty
in
all
and
stirred
their
curiosity
and
friendliness
but
he
had
been
able
to
recruit
only
three
other
males
there
was
rak
blackfurred
elis
and
tawny
surok
were
in
vigorous
middle
years
hard
to
convince
but
quick
to
learn
once
the
barrier
was
down
kamon
was
accepted
leader
of
the
women
white
with
age
gaunt
stooped
but
quick
on
her
feet
kamon
rarely
smiled
but
her
good
nature
was
profound
ann
she
said
you
ought
to
go
we
if
we
can
not
fight
off
these
southern
pygmies
we
can
escape
but
you
one
of
us
would
have
to
carry
you
and
as
mashana
dorothy
says
your
womb
is
needed
mashana
sweetheart
mother
hunting
companion
friend
wright
said
you
dorothy
helen
and
the
giant
children
that
brought
murmuring
kamon
checked
it
only
four
children
still
need
milk
you
samis
your
breasts
are
big
you
will
go
kamon
turned
with
gentle
deference
to
one
authority
she
felt
to
be
stronger
than
her
own
under
the
laws
doc
paul
found
it
comfortable
no
longer
even
amusing
that
wright
should
be
known
to
the
giants
by
his
inevitable
nickname
the
pygmies
disliked
the
short
sound
and
initial
always
bothered
them
to
them
he
was
tocwright
or
more
often
yes
kamon
samis
too
paul
how
many
trips
will
that
take
three
leaving
fuel
for
about
three
more
of
the
same
length
wright
nodded
ed
has
a
notion
of
using
the
lifeboat
for
a
weapon
hedgehop
scare
to
hell
but
with
fuel
so
low
there
was
shadow
at
the
drawbridge
ed
spearman
flung
aside
the
carcass
he
had
brought
ann
white
face
was
still
though
she
clung
to
him
briefly
when
he
kissed
her
it
had
occurred
to
paul
that
image
of
love
would
not
be
given
reality
anywhere
in
the
galaxies
she
wished
moments
to
be
eternities
and
a
human
self
to
be
a
mirror
of
desire
dorothy
and
i
somehow
we
learned
to
let
each
other
live
more
news
spearman
said
i
stopped
at
the
village
a
spy
of
pakriaa
came
home
last
night
must
be
a
sharp
article
did
the
miles
up
the
lake
shore
in
nothing
flat
with
facts
and
figures
lantis
is
moving
wright
dropped
his
hands
to
his
bony
knees
no
doc
but
will
in
a
day
or
so
spearman
sat
down
holding
fingers
till
she
pulled
them
away
he
nodded
to
sears
and
paul
good
trip
he
had
grown
even
more
rugged
in
a
year
of
lucifer
he
wore
only
shorts
and
shoes
months
of
handling
a
heavy
bow
had
made
his
upper
arms
almost
as
thick
as
the
narrow
part
of
forearm
his
face
had
deepened
its
lines
he
had
never
smiled
easily
very
good
sears
said
the
island
is
he
was
silent
spearman
grunted
you
sold
too
well
here
the
news
one
you
remember
pakriaa
second
challenge
sent
by
two
warriors
correct
and
formal
trust
pak
for
that
one
of
those
messengers
is
returning
the
spy
ran
on
ahead
with
part
of
the
body
of
the
other
ambassador
he
studied
the
sickened
faces
two
the
spy
says
lantis
plans
to
send
four
thousand
on
the
lake
boats
another
six
thousand
overland
pakriaa
who
is
in
a
state
of
mind
i
do
know
how
to
describe
not
jitters
exactly
pakriaa
thinks
we
may
feel
the
drums
tomorrow
she
does
know
what
they
are
by
the
way
invention
of
lantis
i
guess
from
her
description
they
must
be
drums
maybe
hollow
logs
mounted
on
boats
she
heard
them
last
year
in
the
war
we
interrupted
you
feel
them
before
you
hear
them
she
says
she
thinks
it
was
a
lake
devil
consulting
with
the
queen
of
the
world
three
the
spy
was
sure
but
thinks
lantis
has
already
sent
six
hundred
east
of
the
lake
to
make
a
big
circle
come
down
on
the
settlement
from
the
northeast
smart
paul
said
to
drive
us
into
the
kaksma
hills
the
kaksma
hills
spearman
gray
eyes
squinted
in
a
sort
of
laughter
they
not
so
bad
the
critters
may
be
all
they
say
after
dark
but
i
better
own
up
i
gone
that
way
on
my
last
three
solo
trips
safe
enough
in
daylight
when
they
half
blind
i
killed
a
few
today
sears
asked
quickly
bring
back
specimens
spearman
teased
the
fat
man
with
waiting
and
chuckled
and
nodded
at
the
asonis
carcass
tied
to
one
of
the
hoofs
do
look
so
worried
doc
i
waded
plenty
of
streams
on
the
way
back
he
rose
with
heavy
grace
and
strolled
out
on
the
bridge
come
a
minute
some
of
you
paul
joined
him
wright
stayed
as
he
was
sears
was
examining
the
kaksma
gray
body
holding
back
its
pinkish
lip
paul
caught
a
repellent
glimpse
of
the
jutting
upper
canines
the
molars
were
shearing
tools
like
a
cat
he
saw
the
spade
claws
of
the
forefeet
the
jet
eyes
were
like
a
mole
look
spearman
said
the
hills
notice
that
hogback
at
the
southern
end
it
five
miles
long
riddled
with
burrows
they
must
live
on
small
game
on
the
meadow
below
and
hunt
the
other
side
of
the
hills
too
where
it
jungle
his
fingers
dug
at
paul
shoulder
he
spoke
loudly
enough
to
be
heard
by
all
listen
the
earth
at
the
burrows
is
red
ocher
understand
hematite
wright
let
out
his
breath
sharply
so
yeah
just
a
mountain
of
iron
ore
merely
what
i
been
looking
for
ever
since
we
crashed
for
a
start
from
iron
to
steel
to
ah
and
just
when
we
it
god
with
organized
pygmy
labor
he
strode
back
into
the
fortress
glancing
obliquely
at
the
silent
giant
women
the
pygmies
do
understand
work
you
know
well
never
mind
it
now
of
course
we
must
get
the
baby
and
the
women
to
your
island
right
away
as
a
temporary
refuge
we
must
use
it
he
watched
wright
with
unqualified
sadness
apart
from
that
you
know
what
i
think
of
your
island
of
that
not
just
ed
adelphi
then
well
the
women
and
helen
and
the
giant
children
with
samis
to
nurse
the
youngest
spearman
asked
evenly
paul
how
the
charlesite
after
the
trips
doc
mentioned
enough
for
three
more
ann
keen
ears
caught
a
sound
mijok
coming
back
the
music
grew
slowly
manifest
mijok
in
an
earth
song
more
than
two
hundred
years
old
chanteys
and
slower
spirituals
suited
him
he
had
teased
ann
to
teach
him
all
she
knew
even
after
she
lost
interest
swift
melodies
and
rapid
syllables
were
beyond
him
the
depth
of
his
tone
rendered
them
grotesque
more
than
a
mile
away
he
was
wallowing
in
shenandoah
mijok
to
whom
the
ocean
was
only
a
word
and
a
river
steamboat
the
cloudiest
of
legends
other
voices
true
on
pitch
followed
his
solo
we
bound
away
paul
asked
how
many
nan
ann
shut
her
eyes
four
besides
mijok
and
yes
lisson
singing
at
least
two
new
recruits
ah
they
can
sing
before
they
talk
she
hurried
into
that
thatched
which
was
her
comer
of
privacy
on
lucifer
the
giant
women
were
smiling
though
kamon
eyes
followed
ann
with
trouble
and
pity
they
hummed
in
counterpoint
their
voices
had
the
range
of
a
charin
baritone
paul
missed
muson
who
could
approach
the
tenor
sears
bass
moved
in
a
trombone
teasing
a
crowd
of
bassoons
dorothy
alto
added
a
warm
thread
of
sound
the
tall
children
and
women
poured
out
over
the
bridge
when
mijok
and
his
companions
were
still
distant
musical
thunder
in
the
woods
pulsed
along
the
ground
spearman
smiled
indulgently
just
like
a
bunch
of
kids
yes
wright
said
the
pygmies
are
more
serious
they
have
wars
sears
stopped
humming
and
mumbled
do
chris
mijok
brought
in
his
triumph
beaming
and
warm
and
my
smallest
woman
dorothy
placed
the
naked
morsel
that
was
helen
in
his
waiting
hands
mijok
was
bemused
how
can
anything
be
so
small
dorothy
claimed
seven
pounds
at
birth
that
ai
hay
mijok
growing
too
elis
said
the
girl
lisson
tickled
helen
chest
with
the
tip
of
a
forefinger
and
mijok
introduced
the
newcomers
one
was
timid
just
a
boy
mijok
explained
knows
some
words
already
though
danik
the
giant
boy
whispered
good
day
the
other
was
older
black
like
elis
trying
to
display
stern
indifference
but
surok
eased
him
into
relaxation
with
a
few
words
in
the
old
language
for
mijok
speech
had
still
the
brilliance
of
newness
but
was
wholly
flexible
he
reveled
in
colloquialisms
acquired
mainly
from
sears
and
dorothy
while
the
boys
and
i
were
out
having
a
hell
of
a
time
what
with
local
industries
the
island
gentlemen
good
sears
said
better
than
i
dared
dream
and
those
tough
babies
in
the
south
anything
new
sears
winced
that
part
ai
good
mijok
fondled
the
fat
man
arm
with
a
hand
mild
as
silk
now
jock
now
we
give
hell
that
what
we
do
hey
paul
abara
trotted
between
sears
and
paul
in
the
forest
aisle
a
silent
ugly
man
with
popeyes
bulging
underlip
jutting
ears
thirty
inches
tall
he
was
his
potbellied
softness
had
the
beginning
sag
of
middle
age
there
was
politics
paul
guessed
in
his
presence
at
the
camp
it
was
not
because
the
queen
had
tired
of
him
that
he
was
temporarily
detached
from
the
harem
his
body
was
agile
for
all
its
pokiness
his
mind
even
more
nimble
his
english
when
he
stooped
to
use
it
was
good
after
the
noon
meal
abara
had
appeared
crossing
the
drawbridge
like
a
wisp
of
red
smoke
ignoring
the
giants
reminding
sears
obliquely
that
it
was
three
days
since
he
had
visited
the
clearing
near
the
camp
where
the
white
olifants
had
learned
to
come
sears
love
for
the
great
leaf
eaters
had
deepened
with
familiarity
he
had
easily
persuaded
the
others
to
guarantee
their
permanent
protection
in
the
laws
he
had
taught
the
pygmies
to
call
them
olifants
a
shrewd
stroke
conveying
to
the
neolithic
mind
that
the
animals
were
of
sears
totem
even
during
the
long
ordeal
of
the
rains
he
had
gone
alone
for
whole
days
and
nights
following
olifant
trails
sitting
in
patience
where
a
tree
they
enjoyed
was
abundant
deep
forest
was
no
place
for
a
man
who
moved
slowly
and
shrank
from
discomfort
and
danger
yet
sears
held
to
this
undertaking
as
stubbornly
as
wright
to
his
dreams
of
a
community
of
good
will
under
a
government
of
laws
and
before
all
except
paul
and
wright
sears
was
able
to
preserve
a
manner
like
the
face
of
lake
argo
on
a
still
morning
that
calm
gave
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
pygmies
more
puzzling
divinity
than
they
found
in
the
others
abara
worshiped
from
behind
a
mask
of
cynical
blankness
pakriaa
seemed
almost
to
love
him
openly
she
was
not
arrogant
with
him
when
he
spoke
she
listened
she
assigned
soldiers
to
collect
the
insects
fish
small
animals
he
wanted
for
study
she
brought
him
gifts
an
earthenware
vessel
with
ritual
painting
odd
flowers
ornaments
of
wood
and
bone
and
clay
she
liked
to
sit
by
him
when
he
was
at
the
microscope
and
peek
mystified
into
the
country
of
the
lens
sears
had
let
the
olifants
grow
used
to
him
he
talked
to
them
he
learned
they
like
to
be
rubbed
above
the
tip
of
the
trunk
and
on
the
vast
flat
tops
of
their
heads
for
this
luxury
they
would
kneel
rumbling
and
sighing
eventually
he
dared
climb
into
the
natural
saddle
between
hump
and
skull
they
allowed
it
they
were
never
excited
nor
in
a
hurry
the
kaksmas
they
probably
avoided
by
keen
scent
and
flight
in
times
of
danger
they
kept
clear
of
the
omasha
by
going
into
open
ground
only
at
night
the
clearing
was
silent
except
for
muted
trilling
of
illuama
the
ground
was
trodden
vines
hung
dead
and
brown
ripped
out
by
trunks
and
tusks
sears
said
that
once
with
no
notion
of
conveying
the
idea
he
had
tugged
peevishly
at
a
vine
under
the
nose
of
his
favorite
cow
so
she
came
and
fetched
it
loose
tired
of
watching
me
act
like
a
damn
fool
abara
said
i
will
whistle
me
two
came
spectrally
calm
susie
sears
called
been
a
good
girl
hey
the
old
cow
let
down
her
many
tons
to
have
her
head
scratched
another
arrived
on
feet
then
two
bulls
together
munching
leaves
the
five
were
placid
enjoying
the
hot
stillness
and
sears
purring
talk
the
largest
bull
stood
ten
feet
at
the
shoulder
paul
estimated
as
abara
approached
him
seized
a
lowered
ear
and
climbed
up
abara
piped
we
walk
now
mister
johnson
mister
johnson
pale
eyes
noted
paul
bulging
jacket
the
boneless
finger
of
his
trunk
groped
suggestively
till
paul
produced
a
fruit
abara
crowed
we
thank
you
they
vanished
in
the
shadows
susie
want
to
dig
some
vines
but
sears
halted
in
the
act
of
climbing
her
neck
spearman
had
joined
them
with
a
good
quiet
you
really
have
something
there
spearman
was
cordial
and
flushed
pygmies
still
make
the
best
wine
ours
is
no
damn
good
yet
meant
to
ask
how
the
last
turned
out
needs
ripening
like
everything
else
in
fact
said
paul
you
slightly
plastered
but
slightly
ed
grinned
how
if
i
climb
on
one
of
those
sears
was
doubtful
have
to
get
acquainted
first
mister
smith
over
there
he
shook
me
off
the
first
time
not
rough
just
was
ready
they
pull
vines
at
command
you
can
steer
sure
if
they
like
you
knee
pressure
abara
good
they
prefer
him
to
me
arek
is
better
still
i
miss
her
mijok
rides
does
he
mijok
and
elis
surok
a
bit
skittish
i
guess
pak
thinks
undignified
or
else
the
damned
witches
disapprove
hm
we
have
maybe
three
days
before
lantis
hits
us
lantis
i
succeeded
in
forgetting
her
for
three
minutes
sears
drooped
his
head
against
the
column
of
mister
smith
foreleg
eyes
closed
he
cursed
without
humor
he
dredged
up
almost
forgotten
words
from
the
old
years
of
earth
from
bars
docks
dissecting
rooms
at
least
four
major
religions
he
cursed
lantis
root
and
branch
ancestry
and
posterity
heart
body
and
brain
regaining
a
trace
of
mirth
he
outlined
a
program
of
correction
that
would
have
kept
hell
under
forced
draft
for
a
thousand
years
still
with
closed
eyes
he
asked
what
the
point
ed
what
the
damned
point
how
many
of
these
critters
have
you
tamed
five
there
another
smelling
around
not
ready
yet
and
five
riders
you
ride
do
you
paul
paul
nodded
abara
and
mister
johnson
returned
in
silence
under
the
trees
behind
spearman
who
was
unaware
of
them
sears
said
paul
good
good
balance
so
you
have
a
rider
for
each
mount
well
i
talked
it
over
with
doc
he
says
it
your
department
what
if
a
bunch
of
those
animals
with
armed
riders
no
said
sears
quite
impractical
why
well
they
wo
go
in
the
open
omasha
they
will
at
night
you
told
me
they
are
not
fighters
if
they
go
where
you
order
sears
said
no
if
paul
and
i
and
the
two
strongest
giants
were
trying
that
what
left
you
doc
surok
and
the
giant
women
spearman
snapped
then
use
only
three
abara
mijok
elis
mijok
will
fight
beside
chris
you
know
that
so
will
i
spearman
turned
away
noticing
abara
and
mister
johnson
for
the
first
time
and
ignoring
them
popeyes
watched
him
from
a
mountain
of
white
flesh
all
right
oh
i
almost
forgot
doc
wants
you
back
at
the
camp
for
another
conference
it
has
just
occurred
to
him
that
since
about
to
be
wiped
off
the
planet
we
ought
to
have
a
military
commander
for
the
look
of
the
thing
you
reckon
you
know
i
dreamed
of
space
travel
from
the
time
i
was
five
never
imagined
i
do
it
with
a
sunday
school
do
hurry
of
course
just
come
when
it
damn
well
suits
you
paul
caught
up
with
him
on
the
trail
look
ed
i
recite
it
for
you
must
lose
my
temper
we
must
divide
must
quarrel
doc
word
is
holy
at
all
times
no
one
says
that
spearman
was
listening
goddamn
it
why
do
you
think
i
gone
away
alone
so
often
to
explore
sure
to
find
things
we
need
by
god
i
found
too
have
i
also
to
get
away
from
the
sunday
school
beating
my
brains
out
to
win
a
little
advance
you
people
ca
see
what
do
think
we
should
do
i
mean
right
now
lantis
spearman
fretted
in
silence
striding
as
if
speed
and
heavy
steps
could
ease
his
distress
why
we
ought
to
have
gone
to
live
at
pakriaa
village
a
year
ago
after
the
reconciliation
while
they
were
still
dizzy
from
the
fall
of
the
idol
you
remember
pak
was
almost
humble
ready
for
big
changes
we
could
have
done
anything
with
her
then
eliminated
the
witches
taught
and
trained
the
best
of
her
followers
we
have
ironworking
now
we
have
a
competent
army
why
we
could
take
the
initiative
drive
south
break
up
anything
lantis
may
have
while
she
on
the
march
yeah
a
year
ago
sure
mijok
would
approach
the
village
so
must
move
there
every
day
is
an
opportunity
thrown
away
wasted
you
think
we
should
have
abandoned
the
giants
what
they
spearman
cried
do
even
understand
work
throw
things
around
at
a
great
rate
and
then
somebody
sees
a
new
bug
or
has
a
funny
idea
or
starts
singing
or
asks
doc
to
explain
a
point
in
philosophy
or
they
decide
to
just
sit
and
look
at
nothing
for
two
hours
fight
mijok
talks
a
good
fight
you
could
make
fight
with
a
kick
in
the
rear
never
tried
it
spearman
smiled
miserably
one
does
with
a
critter
eight
feet
tall
all
right
they
people
they
intelligent
if
we
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
and
nothing
threatening
i
like
to
study
myself
but
look
at
the
numbers
three
on
the
island
six
grown
women
here
twelve
flutterbrained
children
elis
surok
mijok
and
the
two
tenderfeet
they
brought
in
today
is
that
an
army
as
for
right
now
hell
i
given
up
making
suggestions
he
tensed
and
stopped
short
paul
glanced
behind
sears
and
abara
were
catching
up
thought
i
heard
something
what
drums
guess
i
imagined
it
lantis
must
have
a
terrific
organization
bound
to
paul
in
a
community
of
sixty
thousand
you
thought
of
that
at
all
communications
laws
disciplined
army
a
forest
agriculture
at
least
as
good
as
pakriaa
why
from
something
pak
said
i
think
they
even
have
a
monetary
system
anyway
something
more
elaborate
than
the
barter
that
good
enough
for
pak
little
cluster
of
villages
stone
age
but
that
partly
an
accident
of
ecology
is
it
i
mean
they
have
to
avoid
the
hills
and
open
ground
would
be
easy
to
get
a
start
in
metalworking
when
you
have
to
stay
in
the
woods
i
believe
they
a
people
under
strong
internal
pressure
toward
the
next
stage
of
civilization
with
labor
organization
a
few
modern
ideas
there
would
be
ways
to
clean
the
kaksmas
out
of
the
hills
then
metals
we
know
the
omasha
breed
on
rock
ledges
wherever
the
kaksmas
ca
climb
they
could
be
exterminated
too
there
a
whole
world
for
the
taking
doc
is
right
that
the
new
culture
has
to
be
a
blend
of
ours
and
theirs
oh
the
giants
too
maybe
sometime
but
it
wo
be
done
by
piddling
around
with
the
kind
of
pretty
idealism
that
never
worked
even
on
earth
paul
groped
for
the
unspoken
thing
you
have
us
join
forces
with
lantis
spearman
halted
to
stare
at
him
there
was
a
flush
of
blood
around
his
eyes
the
visible
pain
of
frustration
that
never
gave
him
rest
he
waited
till
sears
and
abara
had
come
up
i
a
minority
i
suggested
a
damned
thing
he
was
silent
until
they
reached
the
camp
abro
pakriaa
was
there
with
seven
of
her
soldiers
all
seven
wore
purple
skirts
insignia
of
leadership
captains
was
the
nearest
word
with
makeshift
pigments
and
brittle
whitebark
paul
had
recently
painted
such
a
group
the
effort
was
for
pakriaa
she
had
been
gravely
delighted
with
it
seeing
how
prominent
in
it
were
her
own
vivid
blue
skirt
and
taller
stature
to
paul
eyes
the
colors
had
sworn
horribly
and
he
had
been
glad
when
the
princess
carried
the
daub
away
balanced
joyfully
on
her
bald
head
pak
seven
captains
made
it
a
visit
of
state
wright
was
soberly
intent
and
ann
stood
by
him
regally
silent
for
pakriaa
benefit
but
ann
sardonically
enjoyed
the
pose
pakriaa
had
gradually
accepted
the
fact
of
tocwright
leadership
but
her
view
of
the
status
of
charin
women
remained
addled
by
contradictions
the
idea
of
social
and
mental
equality
between
the
sexes
eluded
her
completely
dorothy
sat
watchful
at
the
opening
of
the
home
room
helen
would
be
sleeping
inside
dorothy
fists
were
pushed
into
her
cheeks
dark
eyes
upturned
to
pakriaa
explanatory
monologue
abara
effaced
himself
mijok
loomed
with
folded
arms
on
wright
other
side
the
rest
of
the
giants
kept
to
the
background
abro
samiraa
abro
kamisiaa
abro
brodaa
pakriaa
was
naming
the
heads
of
the
five
northern
villages
a
loose
alliance
but
those
villages
had
fought
powerfully
against
lantis
a
year
ago
and
each
could
provide
a
hundred
and
fifty
soldiers
and
fifty
of
the
skittish
male
bowmen
they
are
with
me
my
sisters
pakriaa
said
with
sad
gravity
and
not
much
of
her
natural
swagger
the
wormseed
lantis
has
broken
custom
her
own
people
must
spit
on
her
for
the
death
of
my
messenger
i
spit
on
her
heart
and
loins
i
spit
on
her
footprints
the
arithmetic
was
simple
paul
thought
a
scant
twelve
hundred
fighters
against
a
attack
from
over
ten
thousand
four
charin
men
with
rifles
automatics
scanty
ammunition
heavy
bows
a
handful
of
giants
who
knew
nothing
of
war
but
theory
and
whose
basic
nature
would
revolt
at
the
reality
spitting
would
help
he
forced
himself
to
attend
to
what
wright
was
saying
there
must
be
one
commander
i
give
no
orders
to
abro
samiraa
and
her
sisters
my
equals
would
you
and
she
and
the
others
accept
direction
from
one
of
us
pakriaa
murmured
i
have
never
seen
you
fight
spearman
laughed
wright
said
you
will
abro
pakriaa
if
you
will
accept
one
of
us
as
commander
the
army
can
strike
as
one
soldier
there
would
be
less
confusion
and
lantis
will
not
expect
it
that
brought
shrewdness
to
the
little
red
face
but
you
can
do
nothing
hiding
behind
this
pile
of
stones
a
temporary
shelter
while
we
shoot
you
know
our
fire
sticks
this
building
commands
the
upper
part
of
the
lake
and
this
end
of
the
meadow
we
will
not
be
trapped
here
there
will
be
no
siege
if
it
is
necessary
to
retreat
we
know
the
right
moment
to
do
it
the
oldest
captain
nisana
a
wiry
quiet
woman
said
abro
kamisiaa
herself
spoke
of
a
thing
like
this
pakriaa
murmured
absently
did
i
give
you
leave
to
speak
but
she
was
not
angry
she
was
considering
it
this
is
better
tocwright
what
you
say
now
i
will
send
learn
if
my
sisters
agree
but
who
will
be
the
leader
that
should
be
decided
now
wright
said
and
paul
thought
it
comes
ed
you
get
what
you
want
at
and
he
remembered
that
obscure
thing
which
might
not
have
been
in
spearman
mind
at
all
the
thing
was
a
dirty
word
and
the
mind
would
not
speak
it
but
wright
was
staring
at
him
at
him
not
at
spearman
only
one
of
us
wright
said
who
ought
to
lead
in
this
trouble
that
is
feeling
abro
pakriaa
but
i
alone
can
not
decide
it
all
of
us
here
should
vote
on
it
pakriaa
understood
the
nature
of
a
vote
under
her
iron
monarchy
minor
village
matters
were
often
decided
by
that
method
if
her
own
attitude
happened
to
be
neutral
once
made
and
approved
by
herself
a
pygmy
vote
was
binding
as
magic
her
gaze
touched
the
giants
with
a
sour
smile
she
was
visibly
counting
then
she
was
studying
paul
with
new
curiosity
of
the
giants
only
the
two
new
recruits
were
not
in
evidence
paul
glimpsed
the
boy
peering
from
the
doorway
of
private
room
surok
went
in
to
soothe
him
pakriaa
said
i
will
consent
after
the
vote
i
will
inform
my
sisters
as
quickly
as
i
can
wright
fingers
were
frozen
in
his
gray
beard
then
i
ask
that
paul
mason
take
command
his
orders
to
be
followed
without
question
paul
could
not
speak
did
this
happen
how
can
i
he
heard
ann
imitating
the
formality
of
wright
words
but
with
an
undertone
of
passionate
protest
i
ask
for
the
leadership
of
edmund
spearman
spearman
frowned
at
her
flushed
proud
perhaps
amazed
he
said
doubtfully
other
nominations
voice
vote
voice
vote
as
you
wish
wright
said
it
voice
vote
dorothy
whispered
and
her
face
was
begging
it
too
much
can
you
stand
it
is
it
what
i
ought
to
do
satisfactory
spearman
said
paul
nodded
helplessly
dorothy
said
paul
mason
wright
glanced
at
pakriaa
when
spearman
was
nominated
she
had
abandoned
her
patronizing
air
she
said
with
enthusiasm
spearman
mijok
voice
rumbled
in
the
depths
paul
mason
the
voting
went
quickly
after
that
abara
slipped
into
shadow
and
shook
his
head
before
wright
could
call
his
name
sears
voted
for
paul
with
a
wry
attempt
at
a
grin
surok
hesitated
his
tawny
face
smiled
at
paul
with
apology
and
he
said
spearman
golden
lisson
voted
the
same
way
the
other
giant
women
and
elis
voted
for
paul
the
children
were
quiet
not
needing
to
be
told
that
this
was
business
when
one
of
the
smallest
boys
started
to
hum
little
dunin
squatted
behind
him
and
covered
his
mouth
all
the
pygmy
captains
but
one
had
followed
pakriaa
lead
after
a
pantomime
of
meditation
probably
for
the
record
now
with
a
vote
of
this
one
captain
was
full
of
trouble
she
understood
that
she
would
be
the
last
to
vote
and
must
break
the
tie
this
was
nisana
taciturn
with
the
white
scar
of
a
wound
that
had
destroyed
her
lower
left
breast
and
run
jaggedly
down
her
side
paul
had
seen
her
often
but
knew
little
of
her
she
was
studying
the
candidates
with
a
manifestly
honest
tormenting
effort
to
decide
and
she
avoided
pakriaa
astounded
glare
the
green
eyes
fixed
themselves
at
last
on
one
candidate
with
a
blinding
innocence
paul
mason
pakriaa
started
as
if
slapped
but
recovered
quickly
she
said
tocwright
is
abara
not
to
vote
abara
shuffled
a
step
backward
two
steps
forward
it
brought
him
nearer
the
bulk
of
sears
oliphant
his
bulging
eyes
tried
to
escape
wright
look
and
pakriaa
his
ugly
lips
wobbled
he
squeaked
paul
mason
wright
said
abro
pakriaa
i
am
grateful
pakriaa
ignored
him
she
was
saying
with
acid
sweetness
abroshin
nisana
perhaps
you
wish
to
remain
here
it
seemed
to
paul
that
a
mechanical
force
within
him
was
taking
over
unsought
at
a
moment
of
greatest
need
that
would
be
excellent
abro
pakriaa
if
i
am
commander
i
need
one
of
you
here
i
am
glad
to
select
abroshin
nisana
the
princess
faced
him
her
eyelids
flickered
usually
a
sign
of
pygmy
amusement
more
revealing
than
laughter
but
one
never
knew
exactly
the
machine
labored
weighing
dangers
and
advantages
a
direct
order
now
might
win
over
pakriaa
or
lose
her
completely
and
all
the
twelve
hundred
she
understood
and
admired
aggressiveness
she
was
also
a
bundle
of
touchy
personal
pride
and
the
slim
spear
in
her
hand
could
strike
like
a
cobra
paul
said
abro
pakriaa
you
will
tell
the
other
leaders
our
decision
and
if
they
agree
have
them
come
here
at
once
there
was
a
shadow
at
his
left
the
balance
swinging
delicately
was
visible
in
pakriaa
almost
sleepy
eyes
he
thought
thing
quicker
than
a
pygmy
arm
a
at
least
he
would
not
be
pierced
with
while
mijok
stood
there
pakriaa
arm
swung
the
harmless
right
arm
a
harmless
beckoning
gesture
to
six
of
her
captains
who
followed
her
out
of
the
fortress
leaving
abroshin
nisana
staring
at
the
ground
and
very
much
alone
spearman
came
alive
he
spoke
plainly
cheerfully
paul
count
on
me
for
anything
do
whatever
i
can
his
voice
had
full
sincerity
if
his
eyes
were
a
little
too
steady
too
candid
never
mind
it
it
was
a
pleasure
to
take
his
hand
thank
him
turn
to
immediate
needs
two
lifeboat
trips
right
away
ed
in
what
left
of
daylight
ann
samis
and
the
four
smallest
giant
children
on
the
first
all
the
carpentry
and
garden
tools
third
trip
in
the
morning
sudden
relaxation
was
praise
ann
left
with
no
more
protest
than
a
backward
look
but
at
the
last
moment
she
ran
back
to
kiss
wright
on
the
mouth
and
when
ed
was
returning
from
the
second
flight
which
had
carried
dunin
and
four
other
giant
children
to
the
island
when
it
was
night
and
the
red
eye
of
the
lifeboat
was
slipping
down
from
above
the
hills
then
the
drums
began
paul
heard
the
drums
from
within
the
room
that
was
his
and
dorothy
merely
a
section
of
the
thatched
inside
the
fortress
wall
but
dorothy
had
given
it
the
reality
of
a
living
place
there
were
no
chairs
one
sat
on
a
rug
which
was
a
cured
uskaran
pelt
a
gift
from
abro
brodaa
whose
people
had
hunted
down
the
tigerish
beast
after
it
raided
her
village
the
bed
was
only
a
clumsy
framework
with
an
asonis
hide
stretched
across
it
but
the
shelter
had
become
dear
with
use
and
dorothy
had
hung
a
few
of
paul
paintings
on
the
walls
a
portrait
of
mijok
one
of
christopher
wright
which
had
caught
something
of
the
old
man
brooding
alertness
the
red
jungle
flowers
were
too
cloyingly
rich
to
be
kept
here
but
dorothy
had
found
a
blue
meadow
shrub
and
a
white
bloom
that
hid
in
shady
ground
and
recalled
the
scent
of
jonquils
it
was
too
dark
to
see
her
plainly
paul
knew
her
eyes
were
open
on
him
barely
audible
against
his
shoulder
she
said
i
thought
i
be
insatiable
i
only
want
to
be
near
and
not
think
nevertheless
thought
goaded
her
ten
thousand
ten
thousand
what
can
you
all
he
could
say
was
rehearsed
mechanical
and
she
had
heard
it
before
frontal
attack
first
because
the
pygmies
could
be
led
into
anything
else
but
i
shall
turn
it
into
an
ordered
retreat
to
the
island
drive
south
skirt
the
southern
end
of
the
hills
then
straight
for
the
coast
we
be
at
the
island
in
oh
soon
but
the
range
the
coastal
mountains
opposite
the
island
you
cross
them
they
rise
so
sheer
remember
the
river
that
flows
almost
due
west
from
these
little
hills
it
comes
to
the
sea
north
of
the
range
we
make
rafts
to
get
down
that
i
think
there
are
any
falls
at
the
coast
contrive
something
dugouts
with
outriggers
i
already
shown
old
rak
how
to
make
one
he
may
be
working
on
it
now
dorothy
pressed
a
hand
over
his
mouth
she
stammered
make
this
moment
last
but
even
during
the
fine
sharp
agony
there
were
words
i
shall
keep
a
bonfire
on
that
beach
night
and
day
and
when
his
hand
was
slack
in
her
hair
and
she
seemed
to
be
hardly
breathing
paul
heard
the
drums
they
were
far
off
and
everywhere
only
the
remembering
brain
insisted
they
were
on
the
lake
they
were
not
sound
at
all
at
first
a
pressure
pain
in
the
back
of
the
skull
a
rasping
of
nerve
endings
nothing
but
drums
hollow
logs
with
a
hide
membrane
rubbed
and
pounded
by
tiny
painted
savages
you
must
go
tonight
after
all
dorothy
could
not
speak
he
put
helen
in
her
fumbling
arms
he
hurried
out
to
the
open
space
saw
the
eye
of
the
lifeboat
returning
the
drums
took
on
a
rhythm
a
throbbing
in
time
rapid
venomous
but
far
away
still
not
quite
sound
growing
no
nearer
no
louder
but
gaining
in
vicious
urgency
relentless
as
a
waterfall
a
runaway
machine
paul
hoped
that
wright
and
sears
might
be
sleeping
it
would
be
an
hour
yet
before
pakriaa
could
return
with
the
other
leaders
if
indeed
she
ever
did
elis
and
abara
were
on
sentry
duty
the
three
giant
children
still
at
the
camp
would
they
be
sleepless
keyed
up
to
vivid
fantasies
of
the
island
like
charin
children
before
a
great
journey
kamon
sat
alone
by
the
gate
a
small
figure
drooped
at
the
other
end
of
the
enclosure
since
there
was
no
immediate
task
for
her
paul
had
told
abroshin
nisana
to
rest
but
he
knew
her
little
bald
head
turned
to
follow
him
kamon
i
going
to
have
the
third
flight
made
tonight
there
would
be
room
for
you
too
in
the
boat
will
you
go
black
lips
and
ancient
white
face
smiled
up
at
him
if
you
wish
i
do
stay
close
to
dorothy
that
will
leave
four
of
you
giant
women
here
i
wish
they
could
all
go
tejron
sober
and
wise
she
keep
them
together
you
more
needed
on
the
island
do
let
dorothy
be
much
alone
the
old
woman
mused
this
charin
love
is
a
strange
thing
it
our
natures
for
two
persons
to
come
so
close
but
i
see
something
good
in
it
i
think
paul
struggled
to
hear
her
over
the
almost
subsonic
yammer
of
the
drums
it
seemed
not
to
trouble
kamon
much
though
she
would
be
hearing
it
even
more
plainly
i
will
stay
with
her
paul
she
said
and
watched
the
long
glide
as
spearman
brought
the
boat
in
on
the
drawbridge
spearman
cocked
his
head
at
the
drums
that
it
he
read
paul
thought
the
rest
tonight
huh
better
i
think
yes
get
something
to
eat
why
do
you
kamon
is
going
too
spearman
nodded
unsurprised
not
hungry
wonder
how
long
they
keep
it
up
wright
came
from
his
room
with
sleepless
eyes
till
they
attack
probably
all
night
maybe
all
tomorrow
to
soften
us
up
damn
them
somehow
paul
was
walking
to
the
boat
carrying
the
baby
for
dorothy
he
climbed
in
with
her
adjusted
the
straps
helen
waked
and
was
fretful
till
she
found
the
breast
you
bore
her
alone
without
any
alone
dorothy
was
astonished
i
had
you
doc
a
fine
medical
man
whatever
he
says
do
you
remember
how
mijok
held
out
his
arm
for
me
to
grab
when
it
got
tough
he
said
am
a
tree
now
she
was
holding
his
look
with
an
indestructible
smile
until
the
rest
came
and
paul
had
to
back
out
of
the
cramped
cabin
to
give
them
room
then
had
to
stand
aside
while
the
bright
relic
of
man
spat
its
green
flame
and
hot
gases
at
the
lake
and
leaped
to
soaring
and
slid
into
moonless
darkness
above
the
hills
the
drums
wept
raved
obscenely
whispered
paul
did
not
know
sears
oliphant
was
with
him
till
he
heard
the
voice
i
think
paul
the
drums
defeat
their
purpose
they
make
me
sore
instead
of
scared
i
think
you
wo
need
to
worry
about
me
paul
i
never
have
he
glanced
at
the
fat
man
holstered
automatic
remembered
the
cleanness
of
the
rifle
hanging
in
sears
room
my
father
used
to
say
most
men
are
good
watchdogs
who
know
scared
but
stand
guard
in
spite
of
it
only
a
few
are
rabbits
and
possums
paul
turned
his
back
on
the
hills
nothing
was
there
to
see
nothing
at
all
i
wish
you
known
my
father
he
was
a
tall
man
nuts
about
animals
always
brought
into
the
talk
illustration
example
could
stand
to
see
even
a
wasp
beating
against
the
glass
you
never
knew
when
a
deer
mouse
would
climb
out
of
his
pocket
and
run
down
his
pants
leg
paul
laughed
the
drums
fretted
in
passionate
soft
cruel
sears
watched
blue
fireflies
over
a
lake
so
peacefully
still
that
the
sapphire
reflections
were
as
real
as
their
cause
a
teacher
he
for
a
while
till
he
settled
in
new
hampshire
they
would
let
him
teach
nineteenth
and
history
as
he
saw
it
he
saw
it
in
terms
of
ethical
conflict
the
man
versus
the
state
versus
the
various
dreary
socialisms
enlightened
altruism
versus
and
he
did
give
a
good
whether
the
first
atomic
submersible
was
built
in
or
doc
would
have
loved
him
too
he
knew
what
was
meant
by
a
government
of
laws
he
made
his
students
search
out
not
only
theory
but
the
actual
dismal
consequences
of
the
doctrine
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
alexander
augustus
napoleon
lenin
hitler
that
was
regarded
as
minimizing
the
significance
of
technological
advance
he
did
minimize
it
he
just
recognized
that
other
matters
were
vastly
more
important
and
he
did
care
to
see
the
machine
built
up
into
one
more
mumbo
jumbo
so
he
sent
me
through
college
by
breeding
children
riding
ponies
and
selling
hatching
eggs
not
a
bad
life
or
so
he
said
jocko
will
pakriaa
come
back
i
believe
so
ah
chris
nice
evening
for
the
month
of
charin
wright
was
a
paleness
in
the
dark
stern
weary
tall
watching
the
lake
talking
to
himself
the
month
we
named
for
ourselves
end
of
year
one
oh
i
do
call
that
a
pardonable
vanity
paul
i
was
wholly
selfish
in
choosing
you
i
given
you
a
burden
no
one
should
have
to
carry
we
all
carrying
it
thank
you
son
wright
moved
away
to
stand
alone
at
the
rim
of
the
lake
listening
to
the
crawling
thunder
of
the
drums
twice
paul
heard
him
speak
with
an
intensity
beyond
pain
no
one
is
expendable
no
one
is
expendable
sears
exclaimed
look
there
were
five
white
shapes
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
oh
they
never
done
this
before
susie
what
the
matter
there
now
girl
come
tell
the
old
man
paul
followed
him
it
the
drums
do
you
think
the
five
had
been
complaining
softly
but
that
ceased
as
sears
moved
among
them
patting
their
legs
soothing
them
but
paul
their
grounds
are
mostly
north
of
here
there
now
mister
smith
you
old
bastard
so
why
did
they
travel
away
from
the
sound
take
it
easy
millie
miss
ponsonby
the
wild
ones
probably
did
but
these
had
to
come
to
you
oh
that
detachment
of
lantis
the
one
in
the
northeast
do
think
so
jocko
pakriaa
spies
are
all
around
up
there
have
warning
elis
is
posted
half
a
mile
north
of
us
he
know
smell
if
he
did
hear
however
i
go
talk
with
him
the
depth
of
forest
muted
the
drums
a
little
they
were
still
a
cumulative
torture
of
anger
in
the
inner
darkness
of
the
mind
paul
saved
the
fading
power
of
his
radion
flashlight
by
following
his
sense
of
the
trail
he
had
learned
to
move
as
softly
in
the
jungle
as
any
charin
could
hope
to
do
more
softly
than
spearman
softly
enough
to
steal
within
spear
range
of
the
asonis
there
was
not
much
danger
here
unless
it
might
be
from
the
uskaran
a
beast
paul
had
glimpsed
alive
only
once
and
then
dimly
a
striped
thing
slipping
snakily
out
of
his
vision
in
a
afternoon
the
rug
in
his
and
dorothy
room
could
almost
have
been
a
tiger
pelt
the
black
reptiles
were
lovers
of
hot
sun
and
shallow
water
never
going
inland
the
squeak
and
rustle
of
a
kaksma
horde
it
was
said
could
be
heard
far
off
except
during
the
rains
when
all
noises
were
smothered
in
the
long
rush
and
whispering
of
waters
for
all
his
silence
black
elis
was
aware
of
him
before
paul
knew
he
had
reached
the
sentry
post
paul
is
it
the
night
vision
of
the
giants
was
better
than
the
charins
but
not
like
a
cat
they
hunted
at
night
only
if
the
moon
was
strong
yes
everything
quiet
quieter
than
my
heart
paul
still
could
not
see
him
saving
my
flashlight
where
are
you
elis
chuckled
and
slipped
an
invisible
hand
around
paul
the
olifants
came
to
the
meadow
we
wondered
what
disturbed
them
drums
nothing
in
the
northeast
yet
but
a
great
many
of
the
pygmies
are
moving
from
the
upper
villages
i
heard
and
smelled
the
red
flowers
the
people
of
lantis
pakriaa
said
never
wore
those
flowers
and
it
would
not
be
the
nature
of
elis
to
exaggerate
his
powers
of
smell
and
hearing
i
think
the
animals
wanted
sears
could
that
be
elis
alojna
elis
murmured
the
old
word
for
them
it
meant
white
cloud
two
things
nobody
knows
the
thoughts
of
alojna
and
the
journeys
of
the
red
moon
and
the
white
moon
when
we
can
not
see
them
so
we
used
to
say
you
give
us
a
hint
of
knowledge
of
both
things
and
more
than
a
hint
of
much
greater
mysteries
elis
had
always
been
tireless
in
questioning
wright
more
than
mijok
he
was
haunted
by
a
need
to
grope
after
intangibles
push
outward
the
uneasy
border
between
known
and
unknown
so
there
never
an
end
of
mystery
never
the
hand
was
warm
what
is
the
nature
of
courage
the
giant
breathing
was
too
quiet
to
be
heard
to
go
out
away
from
a
world
in
a
little
shell
that
must
have
needed
courage
perhaps
only
a
response
to
a
drive
of
uncomprehended
forces
but
i
think
courage
is
a
known
thing
elis
an
achievement
of
flesh
and
blood
to
hear
the
drums
in
the
dark
and
stay
at
the
post
as
you
are
doing
as
i
hope
i
can
do
myself
i
must
go
back
lisson
will
come
and
relieve
you
soon
pakriaa
had
returned
with
her
five
equals
wright
had
lit
one
of
the
clay
lamps
it
burned
pleasantly
with
an
oil
from
the
carcasses
of
the
same
reptile
that
had
once
nearly
destroyed
mijok
a
thing
which
pleased
mijok
for
he
liked
to
think
that
a
creeping
danger
could
also
be
a
source
of
light
and
the
use
of
this
oil
had
been
taught
them
by
the
pygmies
who
made
almost
monthly
expeditions
to
marshy
regions
and
butchered
the
beasts
by
the
dozens
for
the
oil
alone
pakriaa
was
almost
meek
her
smile
for
paul
could
have
been
a
charin
smile
there
was
a
tremor
in
her
hands
and
once
they
flew
up
to
cover
her
ears
the
drums
he
thought
might
be
a
worse
pain
for
her
than
for
his
own
breed
there
was
unconscious
pathos
in
the
precision
of
her
english
i
did
not
make
clear
that
i
will
obey
you
i
may
have
been
angry
for
that
i
am
sorry
it
is
past
my
sisters
have
agreed
squat
abro
samiraa
lame
thin
abro
kamisiaa
sober
abro
brodaa
these
three
paul
had
met
before
abro
duriaa
and
abro
tamisraa
were
from
the
farthest
villages
and
shy
duriaa
was
fat
with
a
foolish
giggle
tamisraa
had
a
feral
furtiveness
the
painted
bones
of
her
necklace
looked
like
human
vertebrae
in
abro
samiraa
paul
saw
competence
as
well
as
smoldering
violence
the
green
of
her
eyes
was
dark
jade
she
was
a
flat
pillar
of
muscle
from
shoulder
to
hip
paul
guessed
her
to
be
a
devil
of
bravery
good
in
the
front
line
and
intelligent
lame
kamisiaa
bravery
would
be
shrewd
vicious
and
careful
in
fat
duriaa
he
thought
he
saw
a
politician
not
a
fighter
in
abro
brodaa
there
might
be
a
thinker
even
a
dreamer
in
abro
brodaa
the
princesses
had
brought
news
a
scout
from
brodaa
village
had
succeeded
in
locating
the
northeastern
detachment
of
lantis
army
it
was
camped
twelve
miles
to
the
northeast
on
the
far
side
of
a
deep
but
narrow
stream
the
scout
had
shown
the
kind
of
nerve
the
pygmies
took
for
granted
she
had
crossed
the
creek
to
listen
in
the
reeds
and
had
drifted
downstream
the
entire
length
of
the
encampment
the
vestoians
were
careless
overconfident
their
dialect
enough
like
her
own
so
that
she
could
grasp
the
essentials
their
unit
was
six
hundred
strong
with
no
bowmen
the
scout
had
heard
discontented
talk
the
spearwomen
missed
their
subject
males
who
were
camp
followers
as
well
as
fighters
returning
the
scout
had
located
and
stalked
a
vestoian
sentry
stunned
and
gagged
her
and
brought
her
to
brodaa
camp
where
she
was
made
to
talk
brodaa
had
been
about
to
describe
this
when
pakriaa
glanced
at
sears
and
interrupted
they
plan
to
cross
the
stream
before
daylight
move
straight
west
and
try
to
push
us
down
into
the
open
ground
where
the
rest
of
the
army
will
roll
over
us
sentry
is
probably
dead
i
do
want
to
know
not
now
the
machine
in
paul
took
charge
of
the
council
of
war
rejecting
compassion
rejecting
everything
beyond
immediate
need
abro
samiraa
take
the
soldiers
of
your
village
and
of
abro
duriaa
abro
duriaa
you
will
be
in
command
of
your
own
people
but
accept
abro
samiraa
orders
as
if
they
were
mine
pakriaa
intervened
to
translate
for
the
fat
woman
who
showed
no
hostility
but
rather
relief
and
placed
her
hands
formally
under
the
spread
fingers
of
abro
samiraa
in
token
of
subordination
abro
samiraa
take
those
three
hundred
and
the
bowmen
to
the
stream
as
quickly
as
you
can
with
silence
and
attack
the
important
thing
is
to
scatter
them
before
they
are
ready
to
move
if
they
retreat
follow
them
only
enough
to
confuse
them
and
then
return
here
at
once
if
you
can
take
prisoners
bring
them
here
unharmed
but
do
not
be
drawn
into
any
long
pursuit
there
are
still
eleven
hours
of
darkness
i
hope
to
see
you
return
long
before
sunrise
good
pakriaa
exclaimed
and
samiraa
grunted
with
pleasure
brodaa
said
take
my
scout
sister
i
have
given
her
the
purple
skirt
she
is
abroshin
now
and
my
friend
duriaa
waddled
behind
and
paul
sent
abroshin
nisana
to
relieve
abara
from
sentry
duty
nisana
was
glad
to
go
for
pakriaa
still
sent
her
sour
glances
remembering
the
election
sears
was
fretting
my
pets
damn
it
paul
i
dunno
they
huddled
out
there
in
the
meadow
just
get
in
the
way
get
hurt
would
they
follow
abara
i
think
so
abara
slipped
in
and
puffed
with
pride
when
he
learned
what
was
wanted
certainly
they
will
follow
mister
johnson
and
mister
johnson
will
follow
me
pakriaa
laughed
she
caught
him
by
a
prominent
ear
and
hugged
him
to
her
leanness
grinning
at
brodaa
over
his
head
so
ugly
pakriaa
nibbled
his
neck
and
he
leads
olifants
do
be
afraid
little
husband
i
was
never
angry
with
you
look
at
him
she
spun
him
around
for
the
lewd
admiration
of
the
other
royalty
i
could
do
without
him
when
the
war
is
over
i
have
him
back
in
my
bed
but
now
he
leads
olifants
hurry
abara
and
do
hurt
yourself
and
she
sent
him
off
with
a
pinch
keep
them
in
the
woods
paul
told
him
and
stay
with
them
good
pakriaa
sobered
he
could
do
nothing
he
never
learned
the
bow
ah
look
the
red
dot
of
the
lifeboat
had
caught
her
eye
look
abro
tamisraa
you
never
saw
it
fly
at
night
it
moved
with
apparent
slowness
like
a
mad
star
not
toward
them
but
toward
the
lake
perhaps
ten
miles
away
it
was
still
high
when
the
searchlight
beam
stabbed
down
probing
from
northeast
to
southwest
and
vanished
it
all
right
paul
said
i
suggested
he
scout
the
lake
on
the
way
back
the
red
eye
silently
tumbled
wright
gasped
still
all
right
said
paul
a
dive
he
can
make
it
talk
but
the
moment
dragged
out
into
an
ugliness
of
waiting
then
orange
fury
glared
against
the
underside
of
clouds
and
the
clamor
of
drums
abruptly
ceased
paul
said
loudly
mechanically
i
think
he
gave
the
jet
set
a
few
boats
afire
i
did
order
it
doc
and
would
try
it
myself
now
the
red
dot
was
shooting
upward
disappearing
as
the
boat
circled
once
then
growing
larger
briefly
the
searchlight
illuminated
the
meadow
and
spearman
came
in
overshooting
slightly
driving
almost
to
the
moat
before
he
checked
he
swaggered
in
satisfied
see
it
what
did
you
learn
those
were
drum
boats
why
my
god
they
opened
out
like
little
orange
flowers
well
the
main
fleet
is
behind
them
say
thirty
miles
down
the
lake
coming
slow
could
spot
the
land
army
no
campfires
all
right
sit
in
on
this
ed
and
the
plan
was
drawn
up
so
far
as
there
could
be
a
plan
when
the
odds
were
ten
to
one
in
a
world
that
never
asked
for
them
paul
with
mijok
and
pakriaa
would
lead
three
hundred
spearwomen
and
a
hundred
bowmen
south
before
daylight
in
the
hope
of
disorganizing
the
advance
with
surprise
and
gunfire
but
unless
the
vestoians
were
demoralized
beyond
expectation
this
could
be
only
a
skirmish
they
would
fall
back
try
to
avoid
losses
the
remainder
of
the
army
would
stay
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
until
lantis
was
in
sight
wright
at
the
fortress
with
the
giant
women
now
only
four
who
could
handle
rifles
abro
kamisiaa
and
abro
brodaa
in
the
center
sears
and
abro
tamisraa
on
the
right
flank
in
the
west
with
elis
and
surok
spearman
in
the
lifeboat
would
follow
the
advance
party
at
paul
said
nothing
of
the
second
drive
to
the
southeast
the
retreat
that
would
seem
like
attack
when
the
time
came
for
that
he
must
have
in
one
unit
all
that
remained
after
the
first
wrath
had
spent
itself
and
even
then
the
pygmies
would
have
to
believe
that
they
were
attacking
or
they
could
not
reach
the
southern
end
of
the
range
but
would
probably
be
driven
into
the
trap
of
the
kaksma
hills
the
drums
began
again
they
began
after
the
council
was
ended
and
sears
had
gone
to
take
charge
of
his
command
on
the
right
flank
with
elis
and
surok
and
shifty
tamisraa
the
other
small
red
sovereigns
had
gone
too
and
wright
had
stalked
into
his
room
to
sleep
he
said
and
paul
had
followed
spearman
out
to
the
boat
where
spearman
would
sleep
until
it
was
time
to
go
spearman
tapped
his
elbow
you
surprising
me
boy
better
than
i
could
have
done
i
think
we
knock
over
and
the
drums
began
spearman
stared
off
at
the
lake
after
a
while
he
grinned
and
the
lamp
burning
in
the
fortress
caught
the
grimace
yeah
he
sighed
well
i
knew
i
only
singed
he
climbed
into
the
boat
and
glanced
down
with
a
half
salute
which
paul
answered
mechanically
but
as
paul
walked
away
the
thought
stirred
was
like
goodbye
paul
went
along
the
path
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
it
was
wide
and
easy
broadened
during
the
year
one
by
much
travel
between
the
camp
and
pakriaa
village
there
were
occasional
greetings
from
the
woods
these
were
kamisiaa
and
brodaa
people
who
knew
him
brodaa
cherished
a
painting
he
had
made
of
the
singing
waterfall
above
her
village
in
return
for
that
uskaran
pelt
many
of
these
soldiers
would
be
chosen
by
pakriaa
to
bring
up
the
number
of
the
advance
party
to
four
hundred
there
was
no
red
moon
tonight
the
white
moon
was
half
the
size
of
the
planet
earth
so
far
away
that
its
glow
was
scarcely
more
than
that
of
a
star
but
paul
knew
that
by
what
light
it
gave
the
pygmies
could
see
him
smile
in
response
to
their
greetings
they
would
be
studying
him
trying
to
weigh
the
tone
of
his
answer
of
them
might
save
my
life
tomorrow
certainly
i
shall
have
to
see
some
of
them
die
they
are
there
were
two
visible
planets
to
follow
the
wandering
of
the
no
longer
alien
star
that
was
the
sun
one
was
hidden
tonight
the
other
red
like
mars
hung
over
the
eastern
jungle
in
tranquillity
a
little
shape
detached
itself
from
the
trees
to
meet
him
abro
pakriaa
will
you
not
sleep
tonight
paul
before
we
go
it
was
a
human
question
sweetly
spoken
and
meant
kindly
later
i
think
he
stood
by
her
awhile
in
the
blackness
from
which
she
had
come
there
was
a
steady
mumbling
and
paul
knew
what
it
was
the
witches
also
had
their
part
to
play
in
these
heavy
hours
although
long
before
battle
was
joined
they
would
be
cowering
in
the
villages
somewhere
in
the
tree
shadows
they
were
squatting
muttering
the
antique
prayers
he
wondered
whether
to
go
on
and
visit
with
sears
awhile
elis
is
a
rock
better
company
than
i
would
be
at
the
moment
there
was
much
he
thought
that
would
be
good
to
talk
about
with
pakriaa
tonight
there
ought
to
be
words
that
would
reach
her
perhaps
on
this
night
a
glimpse
of
wright
vision
would
meet
with
something
better
than
amusement
and
distrust
but
in
the
end
he
only
said
we
always
be
good
friends
you
and
i
he
thought
she
might
take
hold
of
his
hand
in
the
charin
gesture
she
did
not
undignified
perhaps
but
she
said
tocwright
says
we
are
all
one
flesh
she
said
it
thoughtfully
without
contempt
yes
we
are
all
one
flesh
and
lest
he
become
a
true
charin
and
spoil
a
moment
of
truth
with
unnecessary
words
paul
turned
back
to
the
camp
seeing
that
she
remained
there
in
the
open
looking
south
the
grumbling
witches
behind
her
before
her
the
long
night
of
drums
and
no
red
moon
mijok
was
not
asleep
he
sat
by
the
lamp
i
wanted
to
thank
you
doc
gone
to
sleep
at
last
and
before
i
could
find
the
words
i
wanted
it
will
be
difficult
to
talk
in
the
morning
paul
sat
by
him
puzzled
to
thank
me
because
i
learned
so
much
and
had
so
much
pleasure
in
the
learning
mijok
yawned
amiably
stretching
his
arms
to
thank
you
for
that
in
case
you
or
i
should
be
dead
tomorrow
it
would
have
been
easy
to
say
oh
we
be
all
right
something
like
that
paul
buried
the
words
unspoken
knowing
their
triviality
would
be
a
discourtesy
a
dismissal
of
the
insight
and
patience
which
made
it
possible
for
mijok
to
speak
so
casually
mijok
loved
to
be
alive
there
was
no
moment
of
day
or
night
that
he
did
not
relish
if
only
for
its
newness
and
from
his
sense
that
every
gift
of
time
is
a
true
gift
i
thank
you
for
being
with
us
mijok
accepted
the
words
without
embarrassment
or
second
thought
why
you
know
he
said
in
the
old
days
i
never
even
knew
that
plants
were
alive
but
look
at
this
he
lifted
one
of
white
flowers
from
his
knee
it
was
in
your
room
paul
she
put
it
beside
that
painting
you
made
of
me
before
she
left
he
peered
into
the
white
mouth
of
the
flower
touched
the
fat
stamens
and
stroked
the
slim
stalk
everything
it
needs
like
ourselves
but
i
never
knew
that
we
are
all
one
flesh
paul
glanced
over
his
shoulder
the
red
planet
like
mars
was
still
high
over
the
jungle
he
thought
that
is
hidden
it
will
be
time
to
all
night
paul
heard
the
distant
barbarous
thunder
of
the
drums
in
the
hour
before
his
advance
company
formed
a
furious
serpent
it
stole
two
miles
south
through
grassland
following
the
pallor
of
the
beach
near
paul
knew
they
would
see
a
thread
of
new
moon
in
this
present
darkness
the
vestoians
might
be
slipping
north
on
the
lake
there
would
be
no
betraying
sound
above
the
passion
of
the
drums
as
for
the
land
army
that
could
be
miles
to
the
south
or
over
the
next
rise
of
ground
his
mind
fought
a
pressure
of
alternatives
better
to
have
kept
the
army
in
one
unit
to
wait
in
the
forest
for
news
of
abro
thrust
in
the
northeast
mind
no
time
at
least
his
body
was
meeting
the
challenge
without
rebellion
his
wiry
legs
carried
him
in
silence
his
senses
were
whetted
to
fineness
rifle
pistol
field
glasses
hunting
knife
made
a
light
load
ahead
of
him
mijok
loomed
against
a
division
of
two
shadows
sky
and
earth
not
only
a
sign
that
five
thousand
miles
away
on
the
eastern
shore
of
this
continent
there
might
be
the
shining
of
a
star
now
called
the
sun
mijok
carried
a
shield
of
doubled
asonis
hide
his
only
weapon
was
a
club
since
his
smallest
finger
was
too
large
to
pass
the
trigger
guard
of
a
rifle
though
keeping
watch
with
paul
mijok
had
spoken
little
during
the
night
brooding
perhaps
trying
paul
imagined
to
see
a
new
world
in
the
matrix
of
the
old
but
there
was
no
guessing
a
giant
thoughts
lacking
the
stale
burden
of
human
guilt
and
compromise
they
had
the
strength
as
well
as
the
weakness
of
innocence
the
country
of
their
minds
must
wait
on
the
explorations
of
centuries
abro
pakriaa
close
to
paul
right
moved
like
a
breeze
in
the
grass
she
and
her
small
soldiers
despised
the
use
of
shields
despised
the
arrows
of
their
own
bowmen
as
fit
only
for
timid
males
they
never
threw
their
spears
but
kept
them
for
close
quarters
their
only
other
weapon
was
a
dagger
the
army
groped
through
the
meadow
in
three
ranks
widely
spaced
at
paul
order
beyond
the
right
flank
the
archers
were
concentrated
four
hundred
fighters
altogether
against
six
thousand
a
wooded
knoll
grew
into
silhouette
fifty
yards
from
the
beach
ten
feet
above
the
level
of
the
meadow
we
meet
them
here
paul
said
by
prearrangement
pakriaa
halted
a
hundred
of
her
spearwomen
between
the
knoll
and
the
beach
the
other
two
hundred
on
the
west
side
the
hundred
bowmen
out
beyond
paul
and
mijok
penetrated
the
blackness
of
the
knoll
pushing
through
to
its
southern
side
where
pakriaa
joined
them
even
in
that
short
passage
the
heaviness
of
dark
had
altered
with
a
promise
there
were
few
clouds
the
day
if
it
ever
came
would
be
hot
windless
and
beautiful
no
more
blue
fireflies
were
wandering
the
planet
lucifer
had
become
three
gray
enigmas
of
lake
and
meadow
and
sky
but
in
this
blind
hush
when
morning
was
still
the
supposition
of
a
dream
the
shapes
of
the
trees
were
attaining
a
separate
reality
in
the
west
paul
could
find
a
hint
of
the
low
hills
standing
between
him
and
the
west
atlantic
seventy
or
eighty
miles
over
yonder
dorothy
brown
eyes
would
be
watching
for
on
the
sea
watching
for
it
not
on
the
great
sea
he
knew
but
on
the
channel
that
shut
her
away
from
the
mainland
from
himself
with
his
child
at
her
breast
another
unknown
life
in
the
womb
ann
bryan
too
her
troubled
secret
mind
still
full
of
protest
at
the
contradictions
and
unfulfilled
promises
which
made
up
the
climate
of
life
on
lucifer
as
well
as
elsewhere
and
the
ancient
giantess
kamon
and
rak
and
muson
samis
arek
and
those
giant
children
perennially
puzzling
and
lovable
mijok
was
peering
out
on
the
west
side
of
the
knoll
nicely
hidden
your
soldiers
are
very
good
abro
pakriaa
said
the
giant
whose
knowledge
of
war
was
almost
as
dim
a
product
of
theory
as
his
knowledge
of
the
planet
earth
where
his
charin
friends
had
been
born
the
pygmy
princess
did
not
answer
paul
thought
with
anger
she
understand
even
now
that
mijok
is
one
of
us
the
best
of
us
but
pakriaa
was
staring
south
she
might
not
have
heard
she
pointed
thus
after
a
year
of
waiting
wonder
rumor
a
year
when
lantis
of
vestoia
queen
of
the
world
had
been
a
terror
symbol
of
tyranny
and
danger
but
not
a
person
a
year
that
ed
spearman
spoke
of
as
lost
to
the
piddlings
of
philosophy
paul
saw
them
at
last
saw
rather
a
waving
of
the
grass
a
cluster
of
dots
shifting
bobbing
advancing
pakriaa
voice
was
calm
they
come
fast
they
want
to
reach
our
forest
before
the
light
makes
the
omasha
fly
your
plan
is
good
paul
we
hold
them
in
the
open
the
omasha
have
good
meat
a
man
could
dourly
accept
it
somehow
bred
to
gentleness
undestructive
labor
study
contemplation
paul
could
tell
himself
that
a
certain
spot
even
as
it
bloomed
like
a
nodding
flower
in
the
telescopic
sights
was
not
flesh
and
blood
and
nerve
only
a
target
it
be
so
if
i
were
fighting
only
for
myself
he
held
the
spot
in
focus
he
said
your
soldiers
are
prepared
for
the
fire
stick
they
know
they
must
not
charge
till
they
have
the
order
from
you
her
voice
had
warmth
and
they
know
you
are
my
commander
paul
squeezed
the
trigger
soon
and
too
damned
the
clever
makers
of
firearms
on
earth
had
cut
down
the
shout
of
a
caliber
to
a
trivial
snap
the
savage
eyes
out
there
might
not
even
have
caught
the
flash
at
the
muzzle
there
ought
to
have
been
the
glare
and
circumstance
of
a
rocket
how
could
they
be
panicked
by
a
silly
pop
and
a
spark
even
though
well
one
of
the
dots
had
vanished
true
enough
maybe
he
had
killed
his
first
human
being
he
glanced
westward
wondering
how
soon
the
gray
must
change
to
saffron
and
crimson
the
new
red
moon
there
it
was
a
bloody
sliver
of
a
sword
above
the
far
shore
of
the
lake
and
he
saw
the
boats
they
were
half
a
mile
out
no
others
were
visible
north
of
them
but
that
meant
nothing
these
might
or
might
not
be
the
lead
canoes
of
the
fleet
the
noise
of
drum
boats
in
the
south
was
constant
those
would
stay
anchored
in
hiding
letting
their
wrath
appear
to
come
from
all
parts
of
the
world
the
leading
boat
jumped
to
clarity
in
the
sights
forward
the
bark
roofing
reached
the
gunwale
aft
the
sides
were
open
to
leave
space
for
two
paddlers
paul
saw
the
tight
mouth
of
the
one
on
the
port
side
she
could
have
been
pakriaa
blood
sister
now
it
was
necessary
to
think
of
abro
pakriaa
ambassador
torn
in
quarters
head
and
arms
sent
back
as
a
message
from
the
queen
of
the
world
until
the
mind
of
the
student
of
christopher
wright
rebelled
was
one
of
the
ape
first
it
became
more
necessary
to
think
it
a
good
head
shot
she
wo
feel
it
it
was
not
a
very
good
shot
the
scream
came
weakly
across
the
water
the
paddler
tumbled
an
arm
dangling
the
starboard
paddler
seemed
not
to
understand
and
labored
stupidly
making
the
canoe
lurch
to
port
the
prow
of
a
following
boat
rammed
it
tore
away
the
matting
revealed
the
huddled
soldiers
who
became
splashing
legs
and
arms
in
a
sudden
foam
while
the
land
army
came
on
dots
that
were
bald
red
heads
white
specks
that
were
spear
blades
a
simple
arithmetic
less
than
a
hundred
rounds
for
the
rifle
four
hundred
soldiers
a
heart
divided
but
angry
and
the
devotion
of
an
giant
with
a
big
stick
against
six
thousand
in
the
land
army
alone
pakriaa
it
a
single
column
the
fools
send
your
bowmen
out
west
catch
them
on
the
flank
pakriaa
ran
down
the
knoll
paul
shot
twice
at
the
head
of
the
column
a
flurry
no
halt
some
of
the
boats
were
no
longer
sliding
north
but
driving
down
on
the
beach
forty
or
fifty
like
hornets
from
a
torn
nest
mistake
no
not
if
it
diverts
them
from
the
pakriaa
hundred
on
this
side
of
the
knoll
were
holding
firm
for
an
order
paul
wave
was
enough
they
spread
out
in
the
grass
at
the
edge
of
the
beach
quivering
like
waiting
cats
the
light
was
changing
their
bodies
from
vagueness
to
familiar
copper
black
skirts
white
body
paint
mijok
tore
a
rock
from
the
ground
and
hurled
it
out
to
splinter
the
nearest
boat
but
the
soldiers
would
merely
swim
ashore
mijok
stay
with
me
the
head
of
that
column
was
less
than
two
hundred
yards
away
paul
fired
mechanically
seeing
life
tumble
backward
and
lie
still
let
them
see
us
now
pakriaa
mijok
they
strode
down
the
south
slope
of
the
knoll
in
plain
sight
under
the
beginning
of
morning
as
the
bowmen
in
the
meadow
released
a
harsh
flight
the
beach
on
the
left
became
a
seething
of
yells
snarling
trampling
clash
of
white
stone
and
where
in
damnation
is
ed
spearman
with
the
lifeboat
the
column
was
confused
by
the
many
pressing
up
from
behind
a
few
dozen
spearwomen
streamed
out
toward
pakriaa
archers
a
second
and
third
flight
downed
most
of
them
the
little
men
had
skill
no
vestoian
bowmen
had
appeared
now
pakriaa
her
one
cry
brought
the
spearwomen
out
of
the
grass
west
of
the
knoll
skimming
forward
like
red
bullets
spears
low
in
the
left
hand
until
they
crashed
into
the
column
then
weapons
rose
and
plunged
and
rose
the
vestoians
wore
no
white
paint
their
leaders
had
caps
of
green
their
grass
skirts
were
mere
fringes
they
died
easily
they
killed
easily
some
distance
down
the
column
for
it
was
still
a
column
still
a
rolling
machine
that
could
not
halt
a
tall
structure
was
swaying
hard
to
assess
in
this
tortured
twilight
a
litter
lantis
of
vestoia
the
queen
of
the
world
herself
paul
checked
his
own
running
advance
to
send
two
shots
at
it
then
he
and
mijok
were
surrounded
by
a
writhing
of
arms
and
blood
mijok
raging
but
bewildered
paul
saw
pakriaa
spear
drive
down
below
naked
ribs
and
withdraw
from
what
sprawled
on
the
ground
she
was
untouched
her
lean
little
body
dripped
with
sweat
her
teeth
gleamed
in
a
devil
grin
two
captains
joined
her
the
three
smashed
into
a
cluster
of
shrieking
souls
who
only
began
to
understand
what
was
happening
arithmetic
still
ruled
this
column
might
be
only
one
of
many
pushing
up
between
lake
and
hills
bent
on
reaching
pakriaa
forest
before
the
omasha
soared
in
from
those
hills
to
feed
on
living
and
dead
mijok
brushed
through
the
fighters
with
his
shield
and
down
the
line
till
he
was
clear
of
pakriaa
demons
his
stick
swung
destroying
everything
in
a
half
circle
before
him
he
was
not
confused
now
not
even
shouting
but
saving
breath
he
worked
stolidly
like
a
man
beating
at
a
swarm
of
rats
pakriaa
jumped
on
a
fallen
thing
to
point
at
that
clumsy
framework
down
the
line
lantis
that
is
lantis
the
litter
wobbled
toward
the
center
of
confusion
on
the
shoulders
of
six
women
paul
fired
twice
again
at
it
he
had
a
glimpse
of
a
scrawny
figure
with
a
high
green
headdress
leaping
down
snatching
a
spear
vanishing
in
an
improvised
protective
phalanx
he
shot
into
that
dropping
one
of
the
outer
soldiers
mijok
saw
he
changed
the
course
of
his
attack
a
bulldozer
aiming
at
a
new
clump
of
brush
pakriaa
screamed
in
frenzy
without
meaning
her
spear
was
still
a
part
of
her
she
was
bleeding
from
a
thigh
wound
her
bright
blue
skirt
had
been
torn
away
she
glittered
with
sweat
and
paint
and
blood
a
dancing
devil
mindlessly
happy
then
she
was
down
once
more
in
the
press
squirming
toward
the
phalanx
and
paul
could
not
shoot
but
it
was
the
toiling
giant
paul
thought
who
made
lantis
break
again
he
saw
the
snarling
face
of
the
queen
of
the
world
and
heard
her
squeal
an
order
before
mijok
could
cut
his
way
to
her
the
phalanx
was
running
sheltered
by
the
mere
mass
of
soldiers
it
was
necessary
to
call
mijok
back
the
whole
vestoian
army
was
running
pakriaa
paul
plunged
after
her
caught
her
shoulder
no
pursuit
her
eyes
glazed
in
mad
rejection
he
thought
she
would
bite
his
wrist
turn
your
soldiers
bring
them
down
on
the
vestoians
from
the
boats
she
could
understand
that
her
order
was
the
shriek
of
a
rusty
nail
on
glass
and
it
turned
them
it
brought
them
howling
down
to
the
beach
to
aid
what
was
left
of
the
first
hundred
the
water
was
a
jumble
of
abandoned
boats
even
the
paddlers
had
struggled
ashore
to
kill
and
die
mijok
ploughed
in
a
second
time
that
ended
it
some
of
the
vestoians
might
have
glimpsed
what
he
did
to
the
land
soldiers
a
few
forgot
all
custom
and
threw
their
spears
which
mijok
shield
carelessly
turned
then
they
stared
with
sickness
at
their
empty
hands
and
waited
for
the
club
meanwhile
the
strengthened
crowd
of
pygmies
worked
on
till
the
sand
was
redder
than
the
sky
and
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
back
pakriaa
screamed
no
and
pointed
south
paul
stumbled
on
something
slippery
he
stooped
to
her
yelling
omasha
the
sky
will
be
full
of
them
let
them
fight
lantis
we
lost
a
hundred
already
her
face
became
sane
and
blank
in
agony
my
people
my
people
yes
and
other
boats
are
still
going
north
your
soldiers
must
pick
up
the
hurt
and
run
for
it
there
were
not
many
living
wounded
in
this
sudden
quiet
a
spear
has
scant
mercy
and
the
lifeboat
had
not
come
mijok
was
holding
out
his
shield
on
both
arms
he
had
tossed
his
stick
aside
put
them
on
this
i
can
carry
six
seven
when
the
shield
could
hold
no
more
he
lifted
it
his
face
contorted
and
changed
paul
i
told
myself
i
was
back
in
the
old
life
when
we
always
killed
them
if
we
could
but
the
new
laws
oh
paul
war
perverts
all
laws
but
the
laws
are
true
it
is
climbing
a
mountain
mijok
we
slip
fall
back
try
again
nothing
good
in
war
only
necessity
choice
of
evils
now
make
the
best
speed
you
can
friend
do
wait
for
us
mijok
ran
with
his
vast
strides
holding
the
shield
out
in
front
so
that
the
motion
of
his
body
would
not
jounce
it
pakriaa
would
not
move
till
the
last
of
the
survivors
had
stumbled
past
her
they
were
disciplined
already
some
of
the
soft
bowmen
had
taken
out
arrows
of
the
whining
glittering
type
that
sometimes
frightened
off
the
omasha
they
were
ready
paul
tried
to
count
gave
it
up
less
than
three
hundred
the
archers
had
not
suffered
much
paul
said
your
leg
is
hurt
abro
pakriaa
i
carry
you
she
was
indifferent
i
thank
you
he
slung
his
rifle
and
caught
her
up
naked
and
slippery
with
blood
and
paint
her
weight
was
less
than
forty
pounds
her
head
lolled
back
she
whispered
to
the
sky
no
one
should
call
me
abro
i
am
pakriaa
the
child
weak
as
a
male
a
fool
i
could
have
followed
i
could
have
brought
her
to
the
ground
i
let
her
go
i
am
a
red
worm
i
blame
you
for
it
you
and
your
friends
all
of
you
except
sears
who
is
a
god
with
a
window
on
another
world
hush
the
world
sears
shows
you
in
the
microscope
is
this
world
pakriaa
he
tells
you
so
himself
and
i
tell
you
there
be
a
new
way
she
was
not
listening
still
he
saw
no
threat
of
brown
wings
and
no
lifeboat
but
time
was
a
deception
dawn
on
lucifer
was
abrupt
on
cloudless
mornings
the
battle
which
had
seemed
long
as
had
been
a
skirmish
a
brush
of
advance
parties
lasting
perhaps
ten
minutes
from
his
first
shot
to
the
retreat
pakriaa
head
twitched
from
side
to
side
her
eyes
were
dry
i
have
betrayed
ismar
pakriaa
my
people
are
to
burn
me
in
the
pit
for
the
kaksmas
with
lamp
oil
i
will
order
it
i
would
have
been
queen
of
the
world
making
no
effort
to
escape
from
his
arms
she
burst
into
rage
at
him
a
rage
pitiable
not
dangerous
why
have
you
come
you
sky
people
you
speakers
of
new
words
we
had
our
life
no
need
of
you
we
were
brave
you
weaken
us
with
words
with
words
your
friendship
is
the
weed
that
kills
the
self
you
make
children
of
us
you
break
our
beautiful
image
of
the
god
and
tell
us
she
never
lived
you
say
that
now
she
slashed
her
fingers
down
her
side
drawing
blood
firing
firing
at
the
camp
she
clung
to
him
wailing
and
now
you
carry
me
i
can
not
even
hate
you
you
steal
our
strength
the
priests
were
right
the
priests
ismar
help
me
paul
forced
himself
into
a
run
it
was
firing
rapid
and
sharp
pistols
and
rifles
the
ammunition
would
melt
fast
at
that
rate
he
could
hear
yelling
catching
up
with
the
running
soldiers
leaving
them
behind
he
could
see
mijok
far
ahead
swerve
to
the
left
and
the
lifeboat
was
in
action
it
curved
grandly
from
near
the
surface
of
the
lake
which
was
dim
with
smoke
it
circled
over
jungle
descended
in
another
swoop
at
the
canoes
red
bodies
tumbled
overside
the
silver
nose
tilted
as
if
in
disdain
the
jet
spoke
for
one
second
blasting
the
near
canoes
into
nothing
sending
up
the
further
ones
in
yellow
fire
driving
the
lifeboat
into
its
leap
but
there
was
still
firing
from
the
gray
stone
fortress
a
human
tangle
on
the
beach
before
it
a
high
long
screaming
forward
detachments
of
the
lake
fleet
must
have
passed
in
the
dark
paul
ran
on
only
his
arms
remembering
pakriaa
she
slipped
down
grabbed
a
spear
as
her
soldiers
caught
up
with
her
and
ran
straight
for
the
beach
that
part
of
the
agony
was
almost
done
no
more
boats
were
coming
in
ed
spearman
sky
weapon
had
seen
to
that
there
were
more
canoes
many
more
but
they
were
holding
off
grouping
clumsily
at
a
distance
paul
waited
for
the
lifeboat
to
slip
over
him
and
waved
to
the
south
spearman
altered
the
course
of
the
glide
dropping
after
one
more
group
of
panicked
boats
but
heading
south
a
longer
burst
of
the
jet
and
spearman
weapon
lifted
straightened
shot
out
of
sight
across
the
meadow
paul
could
picture
the
big
man
intent
and
mirthless
grin
the
cold
gray
eye
alert
on
the
fuel
gauge
and
when
this
fuel
was
gone
no
more
it
might
stand
for
a
while
somewhere
a
decaying
artifact
those
left
alive
on
the
beach
were
bringing
in
casualties
the
boats
were
still
withdrawing
christopher
wright
was
in
the
fortress
with
the
wounded
his
narrow
face
tight
in
the
misery
of
a
doctor
who
can
do
almost
nothing
doc
how
many
have
we
lost
here
you
i
had
almost
oh
mijok
what
you
got
there
paul
they
jumped
us
at
no
time
even
to
remind
ed
to
go
after
you
no
he
did
right
more
needed
here
we
stalled
the
land
army
but
they
come
on
they
have
to
in
the
sky
the
brown
dots
had
appeared
at
last
pouring
from
their
foul
rock
ledges
in
the
hills
all
of
them
were
flying
south
pakriaa
look
lantis
has
two
wars
now
she
stood
naked
and
stiff
watching
her
underlip
thrust
out
despair
giving
way
to
a
glare
of
satisfaction
at
the
wings
the
beasts
who
ate
everything
feared
nothing
the
southwestern
sky
was
heavy
with
them
paul
had
been
right
he
sickened
at
his
own
cleverness
how
many
doc
forty
or
worse
this
defense
on
the
beach
was
by
kamisiaa
people
and
our
giant
girls
who
can
shoot
paul
saw
the
girl
lisson
smile
uneasily
at
him
there
was
a
sober
stare
from
brown
tejron
the
other
two
giant
women
old
karison
and
young
elron
seemed
more
deeply
disturbed
elron
studying
her
rifle
as
if
it
were
a
living
thing
wright
said
with
abro
brodaa
help
i
made
the
others
stay
in
the
woods
where
you
posted
surok
ran
over
from
the
right
flank
i
had
him
run
back
and
tell
sears
and
the
rest
to
sit
tight
pakriaa
wright
strode
out
to
her
let
me
bind
that
up
bleeding
she
permitted
it
the
boats
were
clustering
a
quarter
mile
away
paul
fumbled
for
his
field
glasses
they
were
lost
little
abroshin
nisana
whom
he
had
ordered
to
remain
at
the
fortress
spoke
beside
him
slowly
and
carefully
because
her
english
was
not
good
commander
abro
samiraa
is
return
the
plan
good
she
crossed
the
stream
catch
them
in
blackness
a
few
escape
we
lose
twenty
one
was
abro
duriaa
i
am
not
know
how
she
is
killed
she
scuffed
her
little
foot
in
the
dust
there
was
nothing
alien
in
her
smile
those
who
return
tocwright
is
send
west
she
was
puzzled
not
disapproving
why
are
we
most
strong
in
the
west
the
vestoians
follow
lake
shore
he
said
not
quite
honestly
their
straightest
approach
to
abro
pakriaa
village
your
village
is
in
the
west
were
there
prisoners
abro
samiraa
is
not
like
to
take
prisoners
we
took
not
any
on
the
beach
wrong
he
smothered
a
sigh
of
exhaustion
it
may
not
matter
with
mijok
the
stout
giantess
tejron
was
moving
among
the
wounded
paul
noticed
a
heap
of
torn
cloth
all
that
remained
of
shorts
and
jackets
and
overalls
ripped
for
bandages
wright
idea
no
doubt
and
good
the
pygmies
fabric
was
a
poor
second
best
the
war
we
can
go
naked
fair
enough
he
saw
a
pygmy
woman
shrink
from
tejron
approach
she
might
be
from
one
of
the
northern
villages
her
stoicism
unequal
to
accepting
the
touch
of
the
huge
beings
she
would
always
have
regarded
as
wild
animals
paul
knelt
hoping
to
reassure
her
as
tejron
eased
a
bandage
around
a
pierced
abdomen
there
would
be
internal
bleeding
you
are
from
the
north
she
looked
hurt
that
he
did
not
know
her
face
i
am
of
abro
village
then
in
spite
of
her
shrinking
her
question
was
directed
at
tejron
abro
brodaa
has
say
to
us
we
are
all
one
flesh
that
that
tejron
was
able
to
say
that
is
true
and
while
paul
searched
for
other
words
that
might
affirm
comfort
explain
the
soldier
died
the
only
omasha
now
visible
were
soaring
stragglers
the
swarm
would
have
found
the
army
of
lantis
which
must
and
would
continue
to
advance
there
was
a
limit
to
the
gorging
of
the
beasts
they
too
could
die
on
the
spears
meantime
the
lifeboat
was
gone
the
boats
were
landing
in
a
moment
of
darkly
sweet
quiet
which
was
the
eye
of
the
storm
paul
checked
the
giant
girl
lisson
from
firing
at
the
landing
party
save
ammunition
he
indicated
a
tall
shrub
a
hundred
yards
out
in
the
meadow
we
wait
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
until
they
pass
that
bush
then
charge
them
if
they
break
us
down
here
everyone
is
to
fight
west
away
from
the
lake
now
run
down
the
line
pass
on
these
two
orders
lisson
sped
away
her
golden
fur
bright
and
unstained
doc
get
the
wounded
together
have
the
other
women
and
mijok
take
them
west
beyond
sears
group
well
back
in
the
woods
try
to
find
out
where
abara
got
to
with
the
olifants
but
send
a
runner
back
if
there
time
do
come
back
yourself
and
keep
mijok
with
you
i
do
want
him
to
do
any
more
fighting
if
we
can
help
it
tearing
him
up
inside
i
wright
checked
himself
nodded
hurried
back
into
the
fortress
pakriaa
abro
kamisiaa
get
your
soldiers
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
they
vanished
the
meadow
was
empty
of
life
the
many
open
eyes
on
the
beach
would
not
see
what
was
to
come
wright
party
left
the
enclosure
mijok
carrying
the
shield
wright
could
not
look
back
nor
wave
for
his
own
arms
were
full
his
head
bent
in
some
consoling
speech
paul
was
striding
for
the
woods
when
pakriaa
met
him
and
murmured
in
contempt
we
hide
too
commander
he
answered
out
of
a
moment
of
black
indifference
we
all
die
and
everything
i
have
done
is
a
pakriaa
they
may
break
easier
if
they
do
see
us
till
we
charge
she
shrugged
following
him
into
the
obscurity
pointedly
ignoring
nisana
who
came
to
his
other
side
perhaps
still
hating
the
little
captain
for
her
independence
of
yesterday
when
paul
was
chosen
commander
of
this
grotesque
army
the
vestoians
from
the
boats
were
rising
out
of
the
grass
and
coming
forward
steadily
now
with
no
more
apparent
haste
than
the
first
breakers
leading
a
destroying
wave
it
was
possible
to
think
with
amazing
leisure
of
the
high
meadows
and
wooded
roads
of
new
hampshire
paul
brother
had
always
been
a
little
too
fat
and
fond
of
ice
cream
there
was
a
bookstore
in
brattleboro
and
the
waves
of
the
south
china
sea
were
moving
mountains
with
snowcaps
of
foam
as
they
came
in
on
lingayen
why
there
was
a
war
there
once
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
when
the
republic
of
oceania
was
hardly
even
a
thought
yes
they
called
it
a
second
world
war
the
vestoians
passed
the
blue
shrub
the
breaker
was
red
with
a
foam
of
spears
paul
was
swept
into
the
open
not
only
by
the
howling
drive
of
his
own
pygmy
army
but
by
the
machine
within
relentless
again
briefly
free
from
the
compromise
of
thought
he
was
firing
with
precision
in
the
scant
time
available
before
the
bodies
crashed
into
the
unpainted
and
churned
up
a
froth
of
battle
he
had
time
to
wonder
why
nisana
was
here
with
him
a
few
yards
back
of
the
frenzy
she
was
not
afraid
her
spear
was
balanced
a
break
in
the
line
of
fighters
let
through
a
vestoian
soldier
dark
mouth
squared
in
a
yell
nisana
spear
widened
the
mouth
to
a
death
mask
and
withdrew
paul
stepped
into
the
breach
and
sent
a
few
shots
toward
a
trio
of
leaders
something
slapped
and
gouged
at
his
chest
but
his
own
fighters
to
the
left
of
him
were
going
down
outnumbered
he
shouted
at
a
brief
gleam
of
face
west
fight
golden
lisson
was
running
back
from
her
errand
her
rifle
waving
her
lips
straining
in
wild
laughter
she
passed
him
trying
to
bring
her
rifle
into
use
as
she
ran
it
did
not
fire
a
vestoian
was
forcing
nisana
away
from
paul
and
beating
down
her
spear
why
damn
you
the
vestoian
face
dissolved
in
pulp
and
strangeness
under
his
rifle
butt
and
paul
reeled
back
believing
for
an
unbounded
second
that
ghosts
from
a
place
only
a
few
away
had
swirled
across
this
stinking
battlefield
to
shriek
at
him
your
people
always
fought
that
way
the
ape
picked
up
a
stone
but
nisana
was
alive
nisana
was
unhurt
and
alive
he
could
look
up
again
and
see
the
girl
lisson
also
using
her
rifle
as
a
flail
she
was
between
him
and
the
beach
three
pygmies
had
caught
the
butt
and
now
she
swung
them
absurdly
high
she
had
almost
shaken
them
off
when
a
spear
pierced
her
arm
and
hung
there
the
rifle
dropped
she
was
down
under
the
leaping
spears
and
red
bodies
she
did
not
even
cry
out
again
the
golden
fur
was
reddened
and
defiled
paul
beat
his
way
toward
her
scarcely
seeing
what
his
swinging
rifle
hit
knowing
it
was
too
late
forgetting
his
own
order
to
drive
west
aware
too
of
another
tawny
shape
flashing
toward
him
surok
who
had
loved
lisson
who
would
have
been
her
playmate
in
the
next
rains
paul
tried
to
stop
him
but
if
any
sound
came
out
of
his
own
throat
it
would
have
been
lost
against
surok
mindless
crying
the
giant
tore
into
the
press
around
body
and
fell
almost
at
once
crushing
a
few
as
he
rolled
stay
behind
my
rifle
nisana
it
had
become
a
methodical
insanity
like
mijok
a
cutting
of
red
hay
that
spouted
blood
he
noticed
blood
on
his
right
hand
too
nothing
front
sights
of
the
rifle
gouging
him
the
vestoians
in
this
direction
were
thinning
out
and
giving
way
he
caught
up
with
a
back
and
bandaged
thigh
pakriaa
ploughing
her
way
west
abro
samiraa
drove
across
his
path
in
the
wrong
direction
chasing
an
isolated
group
of
three
squat
and
she
looked
happy
and
more
than
in
the
moment
of
her
death
as
she
took
a
spear
thrust
over
her
heart
and
lay
down
with
the
enemy
to
grin
at
the
sky
and
cease
hating
a
rifle
barked
ahead
of
him
that
could
only
be
sears
oliphant
wright
would
surely
follow
orders
and
keep
mijok
and
the
giant
women
with
him
to
protect
the
wounded
abro
brodaa
was
fighting
through
to
aid
pakriaa
not
yelling
not
excited
keeping
somehow
an
air
of
dreamy
contemplation
as
if
the
arms
driving
her
spear
and
dagger
were
not
quite
hers
nisana
cried
out
they
are
not
following
they
go
back
it
was
true
partly
true
here
in
this
patch
of
bloody
meadow
there
was
not
much
left
to
fight
the
defenders
had
functioned
like
a
single
organism
forming
a
new
semicircular
line
behind
it
was
a
quiet
where
pakriaa
was
gasping
pounding
her
foot
into
a
body
that
felt
nothing
and
this
dear
monster
this
fat
naked
grotesque
panting
and
smeared
with
red
this
must
be
sears
oliphant
late
of
john

with

they

back

my

why
they
standing

yourself
jocko
and
fast
that
oh
that
that
mere
nobody

fat
man
the
vestoians
would
not
quit
because
of
what
was
coming
half
a
mile
away
in
the
south
under
a
cloud
of
brown
wings
coming
fast
the
horde
would
be
ignoring
the
omasha
striking
them
aside
spearing
them
when
there
was
time
granting
them
the
necessary
toll
for
passage
and
coming
fast
oh
they
would
be
less
than
six
thousand
now
somewhat
less
meanwhile
the
remnant
from
the
boats
was
waiting
regrouping
drawing
breath
readying
itself
for
the
climax
of
massacre
maybe
deliberately
postponing
it
until
lantis
of
vestoia
queen
of
the
world
could
arrive
to
enjoy
it
paul
tried
again
to
count
his
people
in
the
sturdy
half
circle
black
elis
was
striding
among
them
a
great
stick
in
each
hand
rumbling
comfort
and
encouragement
and
none
of
them
shrank
away
from
him
it
looked
like
less
than
seven
hundred
a
hundred
lost
at
the
knoll
forty
wright
said
in
the
first
skirmish
at
the
camp
twenty
in

night
expedition
perhaps
three
hundred
in
this
last
wave
of
the

and
samiraa
herself
duriaa
tamisraa
wounded
pakriaa
insane
with
grief
lisson
and
surok
dead
lame
kamisiaa
paul
could
not
find
her
abro
brodaa
still
calm
unhurt
competent
very
well
seven
hundred
against
somewhat
less
than
six
thousand
of
the
land
army
somewhat
less
than
four
thousand
from
the
boats
i
dreamed
there
would
be
no
southward
drive
to
the
island
the
omasha
alone
made
it
an
absurdity
he
had
been
idiotic
to
imagine
it
pakriaa
broke
her
spear
across
her
knee
she
walked
out
into
the
meadow
toward
the
advancing
swarm
she
looked
back
stupidly
at
shout
and
nisana
ran
to
her
crying
out
in
the
old
language
pakriaa
with
no
change
of
expression
lunged
at
the
captain
striking
across
her
face
forcing
her
back
until
paul
reached
them
to
interfere
and
sears
caught
pakriaa
wrist
mumbling
come
now
come
with
me
princess
i
am
no
princess
i
call
you
so
sears
said
clearly
and
speaking
with
sternness
for
possibly
the
first
time
in
his
life
now
come
with
me
paul
stammered
have
doc
get
that
damned
arrow
out
of
you
then
to
start
north
with
the
wounded
at
once
north
sears
nodded
there
are
no
gods
said
pakriaa
yes
north
we
catch
up
with
you
i
thought
of
you
as
a
god
think
of
me
as
a
friend
who
loves
you
it
is
better
she
went
with
him
stumbling
as
paul
had
never
seen
her
do
and
when
the
leaves
closed
behind
them
it
seemed
to
paul
that
there
was
surely
the
cloud
of
another
world
she
might
have
been
a
small
girl
going
for
a
walk
in
the
woods
with
her
grandfather
there
was
no
lifeboat
above
that
rolling
swarm
ed
spearman
must
have
time
to
think
about
but
he
had
to
a
little
spearman
was
forced
down
by
lack
of
fuel
and
killed
or
forced
down
isolated
somewhere
miles
away
or
he
had
kept
good
watch
of
the
fuel
gauge
until
there
was
just
enough
for
another
trip
to
the
island
and
had
gone
right
reasonable
what
he
ought
to
have
done
what
paul
would
have
ordered
him
to
do
if
he
could
have
paul
turned
to
brodaa
your
sister
kamisiaa
i
do
see
her
my
lame
sister
is
dead
her
eyes
were
shrewd
counting
we
have
more
than
seven
hundred
two
hundred
of
them
bowmen
bring
them
all
to
the
woods
spread
the
bowmen
at
the
edge
they
will
meet
the
first
charge
with
arrows
nothing
else
and
then
join
our
retreat
send
a
hundred
spearwomen
to
guard
and
help
group
they
will
go
straight
north
send
another
hundred
through
the
villages
to
save
what
they
can
the
children
the
old
and
take
them
west
and
north
to
join
the
others
all
the
rest
will
stay
with
you
and
me
and
elis
to
fight
in
the
rear
delay
and
confuse
fighting
retreat
brodaa
i
see
nothing
else
nothing
else
she
said
evenly
as
you
say
elis
was
with
him
waiting
under
the
trees
and
nisana
who
said
no
gods
there
must
be
other
gods
not
ismar
elis
watched
the
meadow
over
the
crouching
bowmen
within
you
captain
the
god
within
you
made
you
save
the
life
of
my
friend
i
saw
that
i
even
think
i
begin
to
understand
but
that
might
be
vanity
a
sorry
day
moved
into
evening
and
when
evening
became
an
approach
to
moonless
dark
this
day
of
retreat
was
in
paul
mind
a
passage
of
distorted
images
true
or
false
true
that
he
was
now
limping
through
forest
stillness
between
nisana
and
a
skinny
ghost
who
was
christopher
wright
and
wright
carried
pakriaa
who
moaned
at
times
like
a
child
with
a
nightmare
and
up
ahead
were
five
white
drifting
mountains
one
of
them
ridden
by
a
man
who
was
silent
in
pain
sears
oliphant
it
might
or
might
not
be
true
that
at
some
time
during
the
day
paul
had
thrashed
on
the
ground
with
a
broken
head
in
front
of
some
squalling
danger
until
black
arms
swept
him
up
away
from
whatever
it
was
tejron
and
the
two
other
giant
women
karison
and
elron
and
mijok
still
lived
elis
was
walking
behind
paul
unhurt
therefore
the
mind
of
elis
would
still
be
probing
at
the
borderland
of
known
and
unknown
searching
and
incorruptible
all
true
apparently
true
that
the
gash
in
paul
side
had
stiffened
his
right
leg
was
knotting
itself
in
some
unimportant
distress
and
his
bandaged
forehead
no
longer
throbbed
the
first
contact
with
the
vestoian
land
army
had
been
a
swift
skirmish
and
ordered
withdrawal
abro
brodaa
archers
had
crumpled
the
first
enemy
charge
after
that
the
vestoians
had
crashed
into
the
woods
with
no
caution
driven
by
the
horror
of
brown
wings
that
still
pursued
them
paul
had
had
a
final
glimpse
of
the
green
headdress
of
lantis
queen
of
the
world
his
two
shots
before
the
rifle
jammed
had
not
touched
her
once
under
cover
of
the
trees
the
vestoians
had
paused
to
reorganize
giving
paul
retreating
force
a
little
time
and
distance
and
the
help
of
forest
obscurity
the
spearwomen
sent
ahead
to
clear
the
villages
had
poured
through
pakriaa
settlement
and
brodaa
rounding
up
old
people
children
and
the
chattering
pack
of
male
witches
sending
them
west
to
join
wright
group
of
wounded
if
they
could
find
it
but
at
the
third
village
upstream
it
had
been
abro
samiraa
there
was
delay
perhaps
the
people
had
refused
to
go
where
there
were
giants
paul
rear
guard
had
halted
south
of
the
village
to
protect
the
evacuation
here
the
vestoians
caught
up
with
them
they
had
fought
it
out
for
two
hours
in
the
misery
of
bush
and
brier
and
purple
vine
outside
the
village
ditch
while
the
jungle
world
steamed
in
the
growth
of
paul
horizon
had
narrowed
to
the
knot
of
fighters
who
stayed
with
him
nisana
brodaa
elis
an
unknown
soldier
who
fell
at
his
feet
with
a
bleeding
mouth
somewhere
in
that
hell
he
had
lost
his
rifle
it
was
brodaa
this
must
be
true
for
it
was
elis
who
told
him
of
it
brodaa
who
had
guided
them
out
of
the
trap
regrouped
the
remnant
of
the
rear
guard
north
of
samiraa
village
while
the
vestoians
paused
to
set
that
village
afire
and
rejoice
over
its
dying
paul
could
remember
that
regrouping
black
elis
had
set
him
on
his
feet
supporting
him
till
he
could
walk
there
were
many
twittering
bowmen
among
the
survivors
brodaa
had
sent
runners
to
give
the
other
three
villages
a
final
warning
she
herself
decided
against
trying
to
reach
them
with
this
fragment
of
an
army
numbering
less
than
three
hundred
the
only
way
to
save
anything
at
all
was
to
flee
north
join
wright
group
hope
that
the
remaining
villages
would
delay
the
conquerors
and
that
at
least
some
of
their
could
scatter
before
lantis
queen
of
the
world
took
them
for
slaves
meat
and
sacrifice
the
rest
of
the
day
had
been
a
running
a
harsh
drive
into
country
unknown
even
to
elis
there
had
been
for
paul
and
elis
at
least
a
breath
of
second
wind
when
they
found
the
tracks
of
the
olifants
they
had
caught
up
with
wright
refugees
in
the
early
afternoon
but
there
could
be
no
pause
even
though
it
was
quiet
here
at
the
edge
of
forest
and
western
meadow
and
the
sound
of
screaming
in
the
villages
was
an
hour
behind
them
paul
noticed
that
he
was
naked
except
for
ammunition
belt
and
an
empty
holster
perhaps
his
present
clarity
of
mind
was
the
true
madness
the
earlier
fog
of
pain
and
anger
the
mind
more
natural
climate
but
one
might
as
well
reason
and
take
stock
he
remembered
the
map
was
it
saved
no
matter
a
copy
had
been
flown
to
the
island
with
dorothy
and
the
baby
have
a
woman
who
loves
me
i
have
a
daughter
i
have
my
on
his
left
just
visible
in
twilight
beyond
a
meadow
turning
brilliant
with
blue
fireflies
there
were
the
low
western
hills
the
hills
rotten
with
the
burrows
of
kaksmas
and
they
were
nearer
much
nearer
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
except
from
the
lifeboat
ed
spearman
went
there
he
walked
in
the
hills
alone
and
found
iron
ore
and
now
he
is
never
mind
where
he
is
if
the
charlesite
was
giving
out
he
did
right
to
fly
to
the
island
and
abandon
us
what
else
could
he
do
well
it
was
right
too
that
the
hills
should
be
nearer
the
edge
of
the
forest
slanted
northwest
narrowing
the
meadow
and
this
far
north
the
hills
were
smaller
more
broken
up
yet
it
would
not
do
to
approach
them
closely
even
the
least
of
the
hills
so
pygmy
and
giant
tradition
said
could
be
the
dwelling
place
of
ratlike
killers
numerous
enough
to
destroy
this
entire
party
and
still
be
hungry
the
retreat
must
struggle
north
until
the
hills
were
well
behind
shut
away
by
level
jungle
where
the
kaksmas
still
might
come
to
be
sure
but
only
to
the
distance
of
half
a
night
journey
from
their
burrows
doc
can
you
estimate
what
distance
we
made
since
we
caught
up
with
you
maybe
twenty
miles
the
old
man
said
in
more
time
than
once
needed
to
travel
twenty
million
miles
what
is
man
man
a
mathematical
absurdity
are
you
tired
i
could
carry
pakriaa
a
while
no
i
not
tired
son
i
like
to
have
her
rifles
in
the
beginning
there
had
been
only
five
and
one
shotgun
the
shotgun
had
been
taken
to
the
island
dorothy
and
ann
had
their
pistols
there
too
paul
rifle
was
lost
lisson
had
been
lost
when
she
died
that
should
leave
three
wright
had
one
slung
at
his
back
peering
up
ahead
paul
saw
another
in
the
hand
of
the
young
giantess
elron
sears
must
have
lost
his
so
two
at
least
remained
and
one
automatic
wright
those
two
new
recruits
mijok
brought
i
in
a
fog
i
only
just
remembered
lost
said
wright
staring
ahead
the
boy
did
understand
he
ran
into
the
mess
on
the
beach
like
a
horse
running
into
a
fire
that
was
before
you
got
back
from
the
south
the
other
had
more
sense
saw
the
pygmies
spilling
out
of
the
boats
and
ran
for
the
woods
naturally
we
did
try
to
hold
him
perhaps
he
reached
his
home
territory
i
hope
so
behind
him
elis
spoke
softly
it
was
not
very
far
doc
when
we
reach
the
island
and
start
the
new
settlement
oh
elis
when
that
has
been
done
i
come
back
and
find
him
give
him
the
words
him
and
many
others
i
promise
you
that
let
me
believe
it
believe
it
elis
but
the
boy
danik
is
dead
he
was
bright
curious
he
should
have
lived
years
we
overtake
mystery
elis
said
and
leave
it
behind
men
have
never
overtaken
the
mystery
of
untimely
death
there
is
chaos
said
elis
chance
mystery
is
great
jungle
around
a
small
clearing
i
accept
that
we
make
a
wider
clearing
paul
felt
nisana
finger
hook
over
his
pakriaa
groaned
perhaps
in
sleep
the
darkness
had
blotted
away
the
hills
even
the
small
shape
of
nisana
was
growing
too
dim
elis
said
you
limping
paul
abroshin
nisana
is
tired
there
are
still
three
of
the
animals
without
riders
you
and
doc
yes
wright
said
we
might
make
better
time
nisana
trilled
an
order
to
abara
who
rode
the
colossal
bulk
of
mister
johnson
at
the
head
of
the
line
the
animals
halted
without
sound
we
must
go
on
all
night
paul
right
what
became
of
your
prisoner
my
the
mental
clarity
must
be
a
fraud
paul
thought
if
new
memories
could
flash
into
it
so
abruptly
at
some
time
it
must
have
been
after
elis
had
carried
him
clear
of
the
nightmare
at
village
he
had
stumbled
on
a
vestoian
soldier
unconscious
from
a
head
wound
and
loss
of
blood
but
not
dead
he
had
still
been
carrying
her
when
they
caught
up
with
wright
with
this
the
memory
of
that
reunion
became
whole
the
wordless
suffering
on
the
shield
that
mijok
carried
the
improvised
stretchers
the
bewilderment
and
exhaustion
in
the
red
faces
the
very
smell
of
defeat
with
this
also
a
picture
of
the
horribly
fat
witch
from
pakriaa
village
carried
on
a
litter
by
two
spearwomen
and
one
other
witch
a
lank
skeleton
with
white
and
purple
lines
emphasizing
the
prominence
of
his
ribs
striding
beside
his
colleague
and
shooting
glances
of
wrath
from
left
to
right
and
back
someone
had
gently
taken
the
unconscious
soldier
she
safe
doc
tejron
took
her
still
has
her
i
sure
good
wright
added
with
a
harshness
canceling
humor
now
if
only
friend
lantis
will
initial
a
copy
of
the
geneva
convention
he
was
fumbling
in
the
twilight
before
one
of
the
white
beasts
uncertain
what
to
do
the
old
cow
olifant
susie
carrying
sears
fretted
at
the
delay
sampling
the
air
and
rumbling
paul
petted
her
trunk
to
soothe
her
sears
voice
came
down
to
him
paul
take
this
will
you
he
was
reaching
down
the
case
that
held
his
microscope
safe
somehow
out
of
the
inferno
of
the
day
my
grip
not
too
good
got
nothing
to
tie
it
to
bare
a
baby
bottom
like
you
we
look
like
the
last
days
of
a
turkish
bath
hey
how
feel
nisana
tore
shreds
from
what
remained
of
her
purple
skirt
she
looped
them
about
the
case
fastened
it
to
ammunition
belt
feel
good
sears
said
each
word
was
a
thick
struggle
for
normal
speech
arrowhead
came
off
chris
got
it
out
manicure
scissors
for
forceps
you
may
slice
me
and
call
me
ham
and
eggs
if
it
ai
so
right
chris
you
there
i
here
jocko
wright
said
and
under
his
breath
to
paul
medical
kit
lost
i
do
think
the
spleen
is
injured
but
aloud
he
said
of
course
with
your
gut
what
i
needed
was
a
hook
and
line
paul
how
do
you
make
one
of
these
roller
coasters
kneel
down
let
me
that
miss
ponsonby
she
knows
me
at
paul
order
tons
of
gentleness
knelt
on
the
earth
paul
held
pakriaa
while
wright
struggled
into
the
hollow
between
hump
and
head
and
pakriaa
was
either
asleep
or
not
caring
abro
brodaa
here
commander
form
your
people
in
three
lines
with
linked
hands
the
giant
women
karison
and
elron
and
elis
will
guide
them
at
the
head
because
their
night
vision
is
better
than
yours
and
mine
mijok
and
tejron
will
walk
beside
us
we
must
travel
all
night
i
think
the
vestoians
will
not
they
will
not
the
princess
brodaa
said
he
wished
he
could
see
truly
what
was
happening
in
her
little
face
they
will
not
because
they
have
no
giants
or
charins
to
help
them
it
carried
no
hint
of
the
obsequious
thank
you
abro
brodaa
wait
here
a
moment
he
patted
trunk
she
was
a
young
beast
nervous
but
fond
of
him
and
made
her
kneel
help
nisana
climb
up
to
me
abro
brodaa
the
people
of
your
village
most
of
them
lost
it
might
have
been
the
oncoming
night
itself
speaking
temperately
these
remaining
are
a
few
from
all
the
villages
i
think
they
will
follow
me
and
i
will
go
with
you
in
the
rest
of
the
night
a
silence
and
a
drifting
on
the
surge
and
thrust
of
the
great
animal
under
him
it
was
possible
to
reach
a
kind
of
sleep
knowing
his
body
would
not
relax
enough
to
fall
or
to
weaken
his
hold
on
nisana
who
trusted
him
she
was
deeply
asleep
in
the
first
part
of
the
night
occasionally
snoring
a
comic
noise
like
a
puppy
whine
all
day
she
had
never
been
out
of
his
sight
she
had
fought
like
a
hellcat
but
singlemindedly
saving
her
strength
to
deal
with
those
who
threatened
him
it
would
have
been
possible
to
abandon
these
people
at
one
time
paul
remembered
he
had
almost
favored
it
himself
and
ed
spearman
had
very
nearly
hinted
that
it
might
be
better
to
join
forces
with
the
tyranny
in
the
south
life
seemed
cheap
to
pakriaa
tribe
others
life
cannibals
capable
of
every
cruelty
committed
for
thousands
of
years
to
all
the
superstitions
that
ever
crippled
intelligence
you
had
to
look
beyond
that
said
christopher
wright
the
theorist
the
doctor
the
anthropologist
the
impractical
daydreamer
i
saved
a
vestoian
if
she
lives
one
balanced
against
how
many
that
i
destroyed
no
answer
unless
you
can
see
a
world
where
the
ways
of
destruction
become
obsolete
under
a
government
of
laws
with
the
devils
of
human
nature
the
vanities
the
greeds
the
follies
and
needless
resentments
the
fear
of
dread
of
the
unfamiliar
the
power
lust
of
the
morally
blind
the
passion
for
easy
solutions
scapegoats
panaceas
how
do
you
see
such
a
world
you
say
christopher
wright
that
no
one
is
expendable
i
believe
you
but
when
i
must
choose
between
the
life
of
myself
or
my
friends
and
the
life
of
the
one
whom
the
stream
of
history
has
tossed
against
me
as
my
enemy
i
do
that
i
only
discover
once
more
that
i
am
caught
in
the
same
net
with
the
rest
of
my
kind
and
can
not
escape
until
all
of
them
escape
escape
into
a
region
of
living
where
men
do
not
set
traps
for
each
other
and
the
blind
do
not
are
you
awake
nisana
her
even
breathing
quickened
it
seemed
to
paul
that
there
was
faint
color
in
his
glimpses
of
sky
he
remembered
the
silver
moon
that
had
appeared
over
the
jungle
with
so
long
ago
yesterday
morning
the
passage
of
the
red
moon
around
lucifer
was
swift
tonight
it
would
be
rising
two
hours
before
and
would
be
something
broader
than
the
gory
scimitar
he
had
seen
from
the
knoll
i
am
awake
i
think
the
red
moon
has
come
back
yes
she
pointed
over
his
shoulder
he
glimpsed
it
through
a
gap
in
the
leaves
a
good
moon
begins
the
moon
of
little
rains
the
small
rains
make
no
harm
make
the
ground
sweet
is
better
than
the
moon
past
that
we
call
the
moon
of
beginnings
she
moved
restlessly
against
him
this
country
all
forest
how
long
have
i
sleep
most
of
the
night
we
past
the
open
land
she
whispered
no
one
has
ever
come
here
we
have
think
always
there
are
bad
what
word
tev
tevils
in
the
north
tomorrow
rather
today
we
turn
west
and
then
south
on
the
other
side
of
the
hills
to
the
island
ah
the
island
i
can
not
see
this
island
you
like
it
nisana
you
be
happy
there
happy
and
he
remembered
that
the
old
pygmy
language
had
no
word
for
happiness
wright
voice
came
thinly
in
the
dark
abara
stop
them
sears
millie
halted
and
knelt
without
an
order
nisana
jumped
down
paul
saw
the
shapes
of
elis
and
sears
suddenly
bright
under
flashlight
the
only
radion
light
left
easy
elis
said
i
have
you
and
he
lowered
the
man
bulk
to
the
ground
as
susie
moaned
and
shifted
her
feet
sears
had
said
nothing
but
he
was
smiling
his
face
red
and
vague
above
the
disorder
of
the
black
beard
paul
hold
the
light
for
me
wright
removed
the
stained
bandage
there
was
a
wide
area
of
inflammation
the
lips
of
the
arrow
wound
were
purple
pakriaa
you
said
once
you
never
heard
of
poison
on
the
arrows
pakriaa
gaped
rubbing
her
eyes
it
was
brodaa
who
answered
our
people
never
had
it
on
the
arrows
but
in
the
war
with
lantis
last
year
some
of
our
soldiers
had
wounds
like
this
and
what
happened
ismar
pakriaa
stumbled
forward
ismar
took
my
sister
said
brodaa
be
quiet
my
sister
elis
paul
whispered
have
tejron
and
the
other
women
keep
watch
we
must
stay
here
a
while
where
is
mijok
here
mijok
spoke
behind
him
i
have
put
my
shield
over
there
his
voice
became
a
whisper
for
paul
there
are
only
three
on
it
now
one
little
man
two
women
they
might
live
paul
is
it
happening
paul
i
ca
say
it
i
do
know
sears
was
talking
ramblingly
very
far
from
this
patch
of
earth
one
could
only
listen
till
he
was
silent
then
paul
said
i
think
so
mijok
he
needs
to
speak
we
need
to
remember
what
is
this
tel
aviv
the
place
on
the
other
planet
where
he
was
born
and
there
were
the
vineyards
oh
my
yes
the
little
white
and
tan
goats
sears
could
see
it
paul
thought
that
small
country
a
quiet
corner
of
the
federation
where
every
grain
of
sand
might
remember
blood
spilled
in
the
follies
of
hatred
where
a
teacher
of
mercy
had
been
crucified
but
now
for
sears
it
was
not
a
place
of
history
he
saw
gardens
defying
wasteland
the
homes
and
farms
centers
of
music
and
learning
where
he
moved
thoroughly
at
home
discovering
the
country
of
his
own
science
himself
a
citizen
of
no
one
place
except
the
universe
later
he
was
recalling
the
hot
white
streets
of
rio
the
genial
clutter
of
london
baltimore
the
majestic
contradictions
of
new
york
why
yes
doctor
he
said
and
he
did
not
mean
christopher
wright
but
some
friend
or
instructor
whose
image
might
be
standing
in
front
of
the
shadows
of
lucifer
yes
doctor
you
could
say
i
traveled
a
great
deal
in
my
sort
of
blundering
fashion
and
i
would
not
exactly
say
that
people
are
the
same
everywhere
but
you
have
noticed
yourself
the
many
common
denominators
are
much
more
interesting
than
the
differences
are
they
hey
what
sorry
doctor
i
got
no
damned
use
for
your
abstraction
man
and
why
because
he
does
exist
except
as
a
device
in
a
brain
that
wants
to
prove
something
which
may
or
may
not
be
useful
in
any
case
it
not
my
dish
there
are
only
men
and
women
they
get
born
and
love
and
suffer
and
work
and
grow
old
and
die
or
sometimes
doctor
they
die
young
men
and
women
i
can
love
and
touch
sometimes
i
can
even
teach
them
the
few
things
i
know
you
may
take
man
to
the
library
feed
him
back
into
your
electronic
brain
and
do
bother
me
with
the
results
so
long
as
i
alive
to
see
a
child
discovering
his
own
body
or
for
that
matter
a
bird
coming
out
of
the
egg
a
minnow
in
a
spot
of
sunlight
a
blade
of
grass
pakriaa
wailed
what
is
he
saying
he
is
not
here
she
squirmed
past
wright
dropped
to
the
ground
her
cheek
pressed
on
sears
tangled
hair
her
free
arm
wandering
over
his
face
and
shoulder
as
if
she
wanted
to
cover
him
like
a
shield
he
talked
to
me
once
sears
you
said
you
said
he
was
back
among
them
gazing
around
in
sane
bewilderment
i
should
be
riding
pakriaa
why
pak
i
all
right
paul
moved
the
torch
here
and
there
to
pick
out
his
own
face
wright
mijok
the
white
bulk
of
susie
looming
close
by
the
pouting
ugly
mask
of
abara
who
had
stolen
up
close
his
underlip
wobbling
in
an
effort
to
speak
i
fell
asleep
took
a
tumble
almost
wright
muttered
just
lucky
chance
i
saw
you
tottering
you
need
to
rest
a
bit
oh
no
sears
frowned
ca
stop
he
smiled
at
pakriaa
who
had
lifted
herself
to
watch
him
pleadingly
what
the
matter
pakriaa
what
the
time
before
long
paul
said
we
made
good
distance
jocko
the
vestoians
wo
have
traveled
in
the
dark
plenty
of
time
and
we
all
need
rest
take
it
easy
a
while
but
pakriaa
could
not
hide
her
knowledge
that
he
was
dying
sears
touched
her
cheek
with
a
curious
wandering
finger
you
liked
looking
in
the
microscope
did
you
she
nodded
remember
must
be
sure
you
got
the
best
focus
you
can
before
you
make
up
your
mind
about
anything
but
this
is
more
serious
pak
because
i
think
you
love
me
and
you
have
trouble
i
tell
you
again
you
must
go
to
the
island
with
the
others
you
must
live
now
i
expect
to
go
there
too
but
abara
moved
away
paul
glimpsed
him
striding
back
and
forth
striking
the
air
with
little
fists
when
he
returned
paul
made
way
for
for
a
teaching
is
a
gift
pakriaa
not
to
be
thrown
away
abara
stammered
you
have
talk
to
me
too
sears
why
to
all
of
you
certainly
to
you
abara
what
the
profit
of
any
effort
if
the
result
is
thrown
away
in
a
time
of
weakness
you
discard
only
if
what
you
have
is
proven
false
we
have
much
we
never
have
much
some
things
appear
to
be
empirically
certain
not
many
you
know
i
believe
i
given
a
few
people
call
it
a
wakening
of
curiosity
i
think
that
good
curiosity
and
patience
good
as
far
as
it
goes
i
not
ashamed
he
was
trying
to
see
wright
gaunt
face
you
picked
a
tougher
subject
did
you
chris
do
worry
give
you
an
a
for
something
more
than
effort
now
look
this
hanging
around
here
wo
do
he
caught
paul
hand
and
heaved
himself
upright
i
remember
map
damn
it
need
another
whole
day
before
we
pass
the
hills
susie
down
susie
but
susie
fumbling
at
him
with
her
trunk
would
not
kneel
paul
heard
mijok
agonized
whisper
she
knows
sears
laughed
all
right
make
the
old
man
climb
and
before
anyone
could
stop
him
he
had
tottered
a
few
steps
and
burned
out
the
last
of
his
strength
in
a
heaving
jump
toward
her
neck
which
barely
lifted
him
from
the
ground
and
dropped
him
at
paul
feet
groping
for
him
paul
saw
that
he
was
dead
saw
also
above
the
arching
of
the
trees
a
lucid
cruelty
of
morning
twice
that
day
elis
dropped
far
behind
to
listen
and
reported
there
was
no
pursuit
it
was
hard
to
judge
their
distance
from
the
foothills
of
the
western
range
for
now
there
was
no
open
ground
only
compass
the
memory
of
the
map
and
treetop
surveys
that
mijok
made
from
time
to
time
abara
rode
mister
johnson
in
the
lead
making
the
beasts
travel
slowly
since
the
pygmies
were
faint
with
weariness
susie
trailed
forlornly
she
had
not
been
willing
to
abandon
the
grave
till
the
others
went
on
without
her
the
pygmies
carried
only
half
a
dozen
makeshift
stretchers
the
number
of
unwounded
had
diminished
too
they
slip
away
brodaa
said
to
paul
he
saw
three
men
carrying
children
too
small
to
walk
no
old
women
the
fat
witch
rode
his
litter
unconcerned
at
the
fatigue
of
its
bearers
the
other
old
man
smeared
with
white
and
purple
paint
stalked
beside
him
brodaa
said
my
sister
tamisraa
ended
life
with
the
dagger
while
elis
and
mijok
made
the
what
word
grave
we
left
her
body
looking
north
to
help
the
spirit
journey
there
are
many
lost
who
will
have
no
prayers
bad
they
may
follow
us
what
is
this
burial
a
charin
custom
most
of
us
believe
the
spirit
dies
with
the
body
different
parts
of
the
same
thing
ah
she
did
not
seem
shocked
maybe
true
for
your
people
we
live
in
others
paul
said
sears
lives
so
long
as
we
remember
him
that
will
be
always
it
seemed
to
paul
there
were
scarcely
a
hundred
in
this
worn
line
we
must
try
to
hold
them
if
they
want
to
go
if
you
brodaa
or
any
others
want
to
leave
us
you
know
you
are
free
her
answer
was
firm
and
considered
i
will
not
leave
you
wright
had
not
spoken
since
the
burial
nor
had
pakriaa
they
kept
together
paul
was
with
them
sometimes
behind
them
mijok
carried
his
shield
it
was
elis
who
heard
the
bleat
of
asonis
and
stole
off
to
bring
back
meat
for
an
afternoon
meal
it
was
elis
before
that
who
said
we
have
done
what
we
could
paul
we
could
not
have
made
these
people
retreat
in
time
to
save
themselves
if
we
had
abandoned
them
lantis
would
have
left
no
more
than
a
fire
leaves
in
the
pakriaa
is
too
sick
to
understand
that
yet
she
carries
a
grief
like
a
little
one
swelling
in
the
womb
it
must
grow
greater
before
she
is
delivered
of
it
in
the
afternoon
halt
it
was
elis
who
tried
to
make
wright
eat
something
and
sleep
but
wright
could
do
neither
the
giant
women
elron
and
karison
also
refused
the
meat
they
sat
apart
with
stout
brown
tejron
she
was
eating
keeping
close
to
her
the
still
unconscious
vestoian
whom
the
pygmies
had
given
no
more
than
disgusted
glares
tejron
might
be
listening
to
undertone
it
was
in
the
monosyllables
of
the
old
language
the
girl
elron
held
her
eyes
downcast
fondling
the
rifle
she
and
karison
had
been
much
together
in
a
peculiar
loneliness
since
the
children
were
flown
to
the
island
karison
was
old
her
children
grown
and
gone
away
before
the
charins
came
elron
was
too
young
to
have
given
birth
three
of
the
children
at
the
island
were
tejron
the
others
were
children
of
muson
and
samis
and
of
a
mother
who
had
died
in
the
old
life
tejron
wiped
her
lips
and
grunted
impatiently
she
took
up
her
charge
in
careful
arms
and
left
the
two
paul
sensed
what
was
to
come
when
elron
set
her
cherished
rifle
at
his
feet
karison
approached
wright
humble
but
determined
we
must
leave
you
before
wright
could
speak
mijok
answered
her
with
a
sullen
anger
paul
had
never
heard
from
him
i
brought
you
from
the
jungle
with
empty
heads
we
gave
you
the
words
the
beginning
of
the
laws
we
must
make
together
you
lived
like
the
uskaran
furtive
and
cruel
no
wright
said
mijok
no
karison
had
winced
but
she
repeated
we
must
go
the
old
way
we
need
it
then
you
must
go
wright
said
his
spread
fingers
on
the
ground
and
remember
always
that
you
go
with
our
good
will
that
is
so
she
was
torn
two
ways
but
the
old
life
elis
rumbled
elron
come
here
the
girl
would
not
i
hoped
that
in
the
next
she
muttered
when
the
change
comes
you
will
return
to
us
elis
laughed
roaring
at
her
you
a
fool
a
child
the
harshness
paul
knew
was
calculated
in
the
hope
of
changing
her
mind
by
shaming
her
you
think
the
old
life
was
a
freedom
freedom
to
live
like
an
animal
without
an
animal
peace
elron
because
of
the
thing
in
you
that
struggles
for
knowledge
oh
yes
in
spite
of
yourself
and
always
freedom
to
hunt
all
day
or
else
sleep
on
an
empty
stomach
jump
with
fear
at
every
creaking
branch
freedom
to
cram
yourself
with
moss
root
and
slugs
from
the
streams
never
enough
in
the
bad
moons
when
the
asonis
go
north
freedom
to
kill
the
pygmies
and
be
hunted
by
them
never
an
end
to
it
that
your
freedom
without
the
laws
without
the
words
no
so
long
as
you
a
fool
i
do
want
you
she
turned
away
speechless
he
shouted
after
her
in
a
different
voice
he
said
you
go
with
our
good
will
that
is
true
you
ca
forget
us
elron
you
not
the
wild
thing
mijok
brought
out
of
the
woods
you
feel
us
pulling
you
back
you
feel
it
now
and
you
will
come
back
but
she
was
gone
in
the
shadows
karison
following
her
and
elis
rubbed
his
broad
forehead
on
his
arms
wright
whispered
if
they
wanted
it
it
had
to
be
so
elis
waited
for
his
angry
breathing
to
calm
mijok
do
you
remember
in
the
old
days
i
could
even
have
been
your
friend
remember
how
angry
was
only
a
year
ago
you
stepping
over
the
border
of
my
territory
telling
me
i
wondered
how
you
did
it
with
our
few
stumbling
words
telling
me
every
being
should
be
free
to
go
as
he
pleased
anywhere
in
the
world
you
were
in
danger
mijok
i
am
older
bigger
heavier
i
nearly
went
for
your
throat
long
ago
so
do
be
angry
with
these
two
tejron
sat
by
wright
holding
the
vestoian
like
a
nursing
baby
maybe
she
said
maybe
they
will
take
some
of
what
you
teach
us
to
others
maybe
it
will
be
like
the
thing
you
showed
us
how
a
little
seed
no
bigger
than
the
eye
of
illuama
can
become
a
tree
pakriaa
had
watched
indifferently
paul
hoped
he
was
right
that
her
face
was
not
quite
so
tightly
set
in
lines
of
rejection
and
despair
wright
came
stiffly
to
his
feet
a
hand
on
tejron
shoulder
the
other
wandering
into
his
gray
beard
abro
brodaa
interpret
for
me
some
of
them
have
no
english
tell
them
we
turn
west
soon
then
south
through
bad
country
swamp
heat
uskaran
marsh
reptiles
maybe
maybe
the
kaksmas
swarm
on
the
west
side
of
the
hills
tell
them
we
go
through
that
when
we
reach
a
river
we
have
seen
from
the
air
it
has
no
falls
and
flows
southwest
we
shall
make
boats
brodaa
put
it
into
the
high
music
of
the
pygmy
tongue
paul
could
see
no
change
in
the
saddened
faces
by
rumor
most
of
them
would
already
know
this
much
but
the
thin
witch
was
muttering
to
his
gross
colleague
and
some
soldier
faces
turned
to
overhear
that
instead
of
attending
to
brodaa
tell
them
brodaa
this
river
will
take
us
to
we
go
south
along
the
coast
to
the
island
where
our
friends
are
where
we
believe
spearman
has
gone
in
the
winged
boat
tell
them
on
this
island
there
are
no
kaksmas
the
omasha
never
come
nor
the
lake
boats
of
lantis
there
is
game
good
ground
room
for
all
tell
them
no
wait
oh
brodaa
tell
them
in
your
own
way
that
we
hope
to
live
there
in
peace
the
lean
witch
interrupted
brodaa
translation
with
a
wailing
diatribe
twitching
his
twigs
of
arms
lashing
the
battered
soldiers
with
his
oratory
brodaa
turned
to
wright
in
misery
he
says
he
saw
ismar
change
spearman
back
to
a
marsh
lizard
and
the
boat
to
an
omasha
mijok
laughed
savagely
when
did
he
see
that
ask
him
brodaa
did
on
a
thin
shout
the
scarecrow
flashed
her
a
glare
of
resentment
and
a
snapping
answer
he
says
he
saw
it
in
sleep
picture
paul
snarled
yes
a
dream
as
near
as
he
came
to
a
battlefield
brodaa
was
shocked
but
nisana
laughed
the
fat
witch
on
the
litter
was
fuming
coming
from
pakriaa
village
he
probably
had
enough
english
to
understand
it
he
leaned
forward
embracing
his
hideous
belly
croaking
at
the
soldiers
nisana
translated
in
swift
whispers
says
you
charins
all
marsh
lizards
changed
by
says
we
lose
to
vestoians
because
image
was
broke
ismar
punishes
will
i
kill
him
brodaa
choked
you
can
not
touch
amisura
your
spear
will
turn
my
spear
is
lost
said
nisana
loudly
enough
for
all
to
hear
but
aksona
amana
two
other
men
of
magic
those
i
saw
killed
at
abro
samiraa
village
vestoian
spears
was
not
turn
in
the
hand
i
saw
she
stepped
forward
fingering
her
knife
and
the
fat
amisura
cringed
squeaking
wright
cried
i
forbid
it
nisana
let
them
go
brodaa
brodaa
said
quickly
he
asks
sacrifice
you
paul
pakriaa
nisana
laughed
again
she
dropped
her
dagger
on
the
ground
and
slapped
the
thin
witch
in
the
face
the
crowd
gasped
and
shrank
back
such
a
man
paul
knew
was
altogether
holy
never
to
be
touched
one
must
not
even
look
him
in
the
eye
but
nisana
slapped
him
again
and
shoved
him
sprawling
she
caught
a
pole
of
amisura
litter
heaved
at
it
and
he
tumbled
like
a
red
melon
let
them
choose
she
came
back
to
paul
with
grin
and
swagger
patting
her
scarred
chest
i
am
little
spearman
i
break
images
too
and
the
pygmies
were
choosing
not
as
she
or
the
witches
had
hoped
choosing
headlong
retreat
from
this
sacrilege
dissolving
away
into
the
forest
with
backward
looks
paul
saw
amisura
weeping
humping
pitiably
back
to
his
litter
on
all
fours
and
heard
pakriaa
laugh
the
two
soldiers
who
had
carried
amisura
brought
the
litter
nearer
not
daring
to
touch
him
when
he
flopped
on
it
they
bore
him
away
the
other
witch
had
run
blindly
covering
his
insulted
face
and
wright
said
like
a
machine
let
them
go
let
them
sardonically
pakriaa
had
watched
the
whole
incident
without
rising
now
she
seemed
to
want
to
catch
wright
eye
lifting
a
skinny
shoulder
as
if
to
say
what
can
you
do
with
fools
when
the
panic
was
over
thirty
followers
remained
in
the
early
evening
mijok
reported
after
another
treetop
survey
that
the
last
of
the
kaksma
hills
was
about
three
miles
southwest
west
of
them
the
jungle
was
level
it
was
time
to
turn
elis
had
slipped
away
and
returned
with
two
heavy
carcasses
like
wild
boars
sears
had
named
these
stodgy
animals
pigmors
the
suffix
he
had
insisted
was
an
intensely
scientific
shorthand
for
more
or
less
damn
it
the
meat
was
and
coarse
but
safe
hearing
mijok
news
brodaa
sighed
thinking
perhaps
of
the
long
history
of
her
people
the
groping
for
a
narrow
path
of
survival
among
endless
perils
we
say
the
great
uskaran
hears
a
leaf
fall
to
earth
from
a
thousand
paces
away
but
the
kaksma
hears
the
leaf
divide
the
air
as
it
falls
oh
three
of
your
charin
miles
that
is
great
length
maybe
enough
the
tremendous
sheer
spires
of
the
coastal
range
mijok
said
were
visible
in
the
southwest
though
nearly
a
hundred
miles
off
it
would
be
a
clear
sweet
night
he
thought
with
no
clouds
and
many
stars
they
should
go
at
least
fifteen
miles
due
west
then
the
course
would
be
southwest
rather
than
south
to
miss
the
hills
in
the
crowding
darkness
mister
johnson
leading
was
again
a
thing
of
wisdom
his
lifted
trunk
and
sensitive
eyes
avoided
dense
growth
and
drooping
vines
that
could
endanger
the
riders
from
each
necessary
detour
he
came
back
willingly
to
the
course
under
guidance
of
sense
of
compass
direction
and
the
other
four
followed
him
as
the
arm
follows
the
hand
tonight
paul
rode
old
susie
she
seemed
to
feel
happier
for
it
carrying
nisana
again
wright
was
on
miss
ponsonby
with
pakriaa
tejron
unfamiliar
with
the
beasts
but
ready
to
learn
had
climbed
on
millie
back
and
kept
her
balance
without
trouble
holding
the
wounded
vestoian
who
stirred
and
whimpered
but
was
not
truly
conscious
behind
paul
was
the
more
nervous
bull
mister
smith
without
a
rider
and
elis
and
mijok
walked
beside
him
mijok
with
his
shield
elis
holding
brodaa
hand
the
thirty
who
had
dared
to
choose
the
forbidden
unknown
trailed
behind
brodaa
with
linked
fingers
nine
bowmen
among
them
there
were
few
weapons
no
wounded
except
on
mijok
shield
and
this
held
only
two
for
one
of
the
women
had
died
the
wounded
archer
was
with
loss
of
blood
from
a
hip
injury
but
that
was
clean
and
closed
he
was
free
from
the
signs
of
fear
almost
cheerful
the
woman
was
a
sturdy
soldier
of
the
ranks
gashed
in
the
face
and
with
a
leg
torn
from
knee
to
ankle
another
night
of
silence
and
of
drifting
for
a
while
wright
voice
floated
back
i
am
thinking
of
dorothy
and
ann
and
your
daughter
and
not
of
ed
spearman
oh
the
fuel
must
have
been
getting
low
paul
nothing
the
boat
could
do
for
us
after
we
were
back
in
the
woods
he
must
be
at
the
island
paul
could
only
say
i
hope
so
the
thing
spearman
had
almost
said
when
his
anger
and
disappointment
were
high
the
hint
at
joining
forces
with
lantis
in
abandonment
of
everything
thus
far
achieved
nothing
could
be
gained
by
speaking
of
that
now
but
some
of
spearman
words
murmured
on
in
darkness
terrific
organization
monetary
system
whole
world
for
the
taking
pretty
idealism
that
never
worked
even
on
earth
there
had
always
been
strain
and
mutual
exasperation
in
argument
with
ed
spearman
long
ago
on
the
ship
the
collectivist
party
surviving
as
an
innocuous
political
group
after
the
horrors
of
the
civil
war
of
lived
strongly
in
spearman
mind
not
only
because
his
father
had
fought
for
it
lacking
the
frenzied
dogmatism
of
the
antique
communism
it
resembled
it
was
nevertheless
natural
heir
a
party
of
iron
doctrines
simplified
for
minds
that
resented
analysis
and
magnified
man
out
of
a
dislike
for
men
like
communism
it
needed
to
imagine
a
class
war
and
felt
that
it
had
a
tight
vested
monopoly
of
the
underdog
the
said
one
of
its
late
prophets
as
humorless
as
his
predecessors
believed
in
man
you
could
always
fluster
a
collectivist
by
asking
for
a
logical
breakdown
of
that
and
make
an
enemy
they
were
usually
good
haters
and
made
a
virtue
of
it
the
years
following
the
civil
war
had
been
troubled
though
materially
prosperous
darkened
by
the
of
yet
another
monolithic
state
under
jenga
the
mongol
who
had
inherited
the
desolation
of
the
war
of
in
those
years
the
collectivist
party
in
the
federation
unsupported
by
any
conveniently
foreign
deity
had
become
not
much
more
than
a
decayed
socialism
with
a
dash
of
bitters
but
it
was
alive
at
the
time
left
the
spaceport
it
had
had
ten
senators
and
a
larger
handful
of
delegates
in
the
federation
congress
it
was
respectable
no
longer
subversive
and
owned
a
small
hard
core
of
the
aggressively
sincere
not
wright
nor
sears
nor
anyone
had
ever
been
able
to
convince
edmund
spearman
that
evil
means
breed
a
further
evil
which
swallows
up
any
good
that
may
have
been
imagined
in
the
beginning
spearman
could
admit
that
himself
in
no
way
an
evil
man
he
would
not
do
evil
if
he
could
help
it
but
in
the
region
of
theory
spearman
held
quite
simply
that
you
ca
make
an
omelette
without
breaking
eggs
and
that
settled
it
they
should
be
safe
wright
said
you
and
jocko
saw
the
island
it
beautiful
i
know
they
all
right
yes
would
you
say
it
was
a
place
where
ann
might
oh
how
shall
i
say
it
might
attain
tranquillity
not
cry
too
much
for
the
moon
if
there
is
any
such
place
in
the
galaxy
time
elis
said
little
needs
time
she
is
like
grass
i
have
seen
growing
in
too
much
shade
she
is
not
like
our
mashana
dorothy
who
will
make
sunshine
if
the
other
sun
is
clouded
listen
brodaa
voice
listen
paul
heard
nothing
at
first
up
ahead
abara
sputtered
mister
johnson
be
quiet
is
nothing
be
quiet
nisana
came
broad
awake
in
paul
arms
wright
mount
halted
as
did
susie
but
susie
was
trembling
raising
and
swinging
her
head
in
a
way
to
make
balance
difficult
paul
saw
the
white
writhing
of
her
trunk
lifted
to
explore
for
a
scent
he
heard
it
then
a
long
rustling
like
a
repeated
tearing
of
paper
behind
a
closed
door
nothing
else
a
wet
howl
from
mister
johnson
sent
a
spasm
through
mass
her
muscles
bunched
abara
voice
wailed
back
mister
joh
i
can
not
hold
him
transition
from
realization
to
stampede
was
a
flash
like
the
pain
of
a
blow
paul
heard
mijok
my
shield
it
will
hold
more
elis
cried
something
to
brodaa
then
susie
had
plunged
ahead
uncontrollable
paul
could
only
bend
low
above
the
clinging
of
nisana
hold
on
with
hands
and
knees
hope
that
no
trailing
vine
or
branch
would
sweep
them
off
into
death
mister
johnson
could
make
no
careful
choice
of
a
trail
now
he
would
be
parting
the
jungle
like
a
bullet
do
be
afraid
nisana
we
can
outrun
them
my
people
elis
and
mijok
can
outrun
them
too
they
carry
all
they
can
in
spite
of
the
agony
of
mere
hanging
on
mere
straining
to
stay
alive
he
had
to
think
were
loyal
and
we
got
them
into
this
branches
slashed
across
his
back
stinging
and
scraping
once
susie
stumbled
and
recovered
as
the
group
went
splattering
across
some
invisible
mud
and
paul
wondered
if
mister
johnson
in
his
terror
would
run
them
into
quicksand
or
marsh
that
ended
there
was
more
thick
jungle
whipping
his
back
for
five
minutes
an
hour
this
too
ended
crazed
or
purposeful
the
beasts
charged
out
into
open
land
through
a
soft
roaring
of
torn
grass
paul
could
twist
his
head
to
glance
upward
at
a
field
of
stars
he
could
not
win
a
backward
look
for
elis
and
mijok
his
neck
and
arm
muscles
were
stiffened
in
his
grasp
of
ears
and
he
dared
not
risk
disturbing
nisana
clutch
of
him
but
to
left
and
right
he
could
make
out
other
shapes
under
starlight
and
hear
a
frantic
thudding
of
hoofs
fleeing
asonis
other
innocent
woodland
cattle
with
a
hunger
to
live
once
he
glimpsed
a
thing
pass
off
to
the
left
in
wild
leaps
lifting
it
above
the
grass
tops
uskaran
he
thought
the
huge
tiger
cat
no
enemy
but
a
brother
in
panic
the
open
ground
ended
at
water
here
at
last
the
olifants
slowed
to
a
halt
unlike
the
lesser
desperate
brutes
for
mister
johnson
was
still
wise
considering
the
stream
aware
of
his
leadership
paul
could
shout
to
the
others
now
and
they
all
answered
but
his
backward
staring
found
only
the
stars
the
white
mass
of
mister
smith
the
disturbed
darkness
that
must
be
meadow
elis
mijok
no
answer
could
have
reached
him
above
the
bleating
and
thunder
of
terrorized
harmless
things
crossing
the
field
and
hurtling
blindly
into
the
river
mister
johnson
was
wading
in
deliberately
there
was
splashing
at
first
then
silence
as
cool
water
came
up
around
knees
and
susie
motion
changed
to
a
smooth
throbbing
and
heaving
he
saw
small
foam
where
the
curve
of
her
lifted
trunk
cut
the
water
he
whispered
to
nisana
we
safe
dear
big
river
kaksmas
wo
cross
it
mister
johnson
was
leading
them
in
an
upstream
slant
bearing
well
to
the
right
while
the
bobbing
frantic
heads
of
other
creatures
let
the
moderate
current
press
them
away
to
the
left
this
way
whether
by
mister
johnson
wisdom
or
abara
guidance
they
might
be
able
to
come
ashore
clear
of
the
dangerous
passage
of
the
stampede
my
people
can
not
go
through
the
water
we
never
elis
and
mijok
can
swim
they
get
them
across
somehow
maybe
the
shield
will
float
nisana
the
madness
behind
them
dwindled
into
the
faraway
in
growing
quiet
wright
voice
came
back
not
loudly
i
am
a
murderer
paul
wondered
what
insight
made
him
call
out
words
not
his
own
the
profit
of
any
effort
if
the
result
is
thrown
away
in
a
time
of
weakness
the
even
motion
became
a
clumsiness
of
wading
in
mud
then
there
was
solid
ground
paul
said
halt
them
here
if
you
can
abara
mister
johnson
must
have
shared
the
sense
of
safety
they
all
calmed
heads
drooping
shaken
breathing
slowing
to
sighs
down
susie
all
but
abara
descended
this
was
still
open
grassland
but
there
was
a
black
velvet
curtain
of
jungle
not
far
off
doc
still
got
your
flashlight
eh
no
lost
somewhere
the
old
man
spoke
vacantly
he
stumbled
to
the
edge
of
the
water
sat
with
his
head
on
his
knees
tejron
still
had
her
vestoian
but
now
the
pygmy
woman
was
panting
fully
conscious
in
tejron
arms
and
witless
with
fear
tejron
said
she
trying
to
break
away
ca
someone
talk
to
her
pakriaa
paul
searched
for
the
princess
here
please
nisana
whispered
i
will
talk
to
the
vestoian
yes
not
yet
if
pakriaa
pakriaa
said
thickly
i
am
here
what
to
say
she
is
nothing
she
is
nothing
to
you
pakriaa
then
sears
chose
a
poor
student
brodaa
would
have
spoken
to
her
i
ask
you
to
tell
her
the
war
is
over
and
she
is
among
friends
friends
she
is
vestoian
pakriaa
approached
wright
who
did
not
look
up
tocwright
i
must
speak
to
the
vestoian
kaksma
i
owe
you
my
life
will
obey
you
he
groaned
i
do
not
want
you
to
obey
me
if
there
is
nothing
inside
to
tell
you
what
you
should
do
then
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
pakriaa
flung
up
her
arm
across
her
eyes
as
if
struck
tejron
muttered
i
ca
restrain
her
much
longer
without
hurting
her
it
was
nisana
who
gave
the
vestoian
the
message
in
the
pygmy
tongue
a
ripple
of
sound
that
must
have
conveyed
some
reassurance
for
the
struggling
ceased
look
paul
dug
his
fingers
in
wright
shoulder
over
there
the
dark
spot
under
starlight
was
surely
the
floating
shield
behind
it
another
purposeful
splashing
rise
and
fall
of
a
driving
arm
mijok
wright
was
on
his
feet
this
way
a
little
upstream
both
giants
were
bleeding
from
small
double
stab
wounds
of
the
kaksma
teeth
there
were
four
pygmies
on
mijok
shield
elis
had
carried
brodaa
and
another
in
his
arms
and
one
on
his
back
they
had
clung
to
his
fur
as
he
swam
the
river
mijok
plucked
a
sodden
thing
from
his
thigh
its
jaws
had
clenched
in
flesh
when
he
smashed
its
body
he
flipped
the
ratty
thing
into
the
water
and
remarked
like
a
charin
damned
if
i
could
ever
care
for
the
others
we
tried
to
help
them
into
the
trees
said
elis
could
be
some
safety
in
that
if
the
swarm
passes
by
but
most
of
them
ran
blindly
so
beyond
that
doc
do
ever
ask
us
we
must
forget
some
things
we
all
done
what
we
could
so
let
rest
a
while
and
go
on
oh
we
go
on
wright
said
chaos
or
maybe
a
little
bit
of
light
from
time
to
time
what
sixteen
of
us
now
which
way
was
the
swarm
going
north
our
flight
was
west
i
think
this
place
is
safe
abara
called
down
mister
johnson
says
it
is
safe
paul
said
no
more
travel
tonight
wait
here
for
daylight
this
is
not
the
river
we
wanted
but
we
know
it
reaches
the
sea
somehow
think
about
that
in
the
morning
and
if
you
will
doc
i
like
to
make
that
my
last
order
let
elis
be
our
commander
till
we
reach
the
island
i
elis
was
shocked
but
paul
i
am
a
big
baby
i
wonder
and
wonder
and
never
find
the
answer
to
anything
wright
laughed
it
sounded
like
laughter
at
any
rate
when
his
voice
found
words
it
was
warm
relieved
more
like
his
own
than
it
had
been
at
any
time
since
the
drums
sounded
on
lake
argo
that
matter
elis
paul
has
done
all
anyone
could
done
it
well
and
leadership
a
wearing
thing
but
you
can
carry
it
paul
wished
he
could
see
the
black
face
in
the
dark
he
might
learn
from
it
he
thought
so
far
as
a
charin
was
capable
of
learning
elis
said
dazedly
if
you
all
wish
it
i
wish
it
said
abro
brodaa
yes
mijok
said
let
not
trouble
to
vote
we
know
you
elis
i
do
my
best
most
of
the
pygmies
collapsed
in
sleep
the
bites
the
giants
had
received
were
not
numerous
enough
to
be
a
danger
but
both
were
in
some
pain
and
wakeful
abara
also
said
he
would
prefer
to
watch
out
the
night
and
not
sleep
paul
stretched
on
the
damp
grass
aware
of
nisana
sitting
near
him
he
tried
to
make
a
mental
refuge
of
dorothy
and
the
island
for
a
time
it
was
possible
but
twice
as
he
thought
he
was
drifting
into
true
healing
sleep
the
present
pulled
at
him
and
the
thought
was
not
of
dorothy
but
of
pakriaa
throwing
up
her
arm
across
her
eyes
as
if
wright
words
had
been
a
deeper
wound
than
any
she
had
received
in
these
days
of
calamity
and
defeat
he
woke
while
it
was
still
night
the
red
moon
had
risen
changing
the
river
to
deep
purple
the
stampede
was
all
ended
and
stillness
was
everywhere
underlying
the
low
voices
of
wright
and
elis
he
saw
the
small
silhouette
of
nisana
beside
him
he
could
make
out
none
of
the
others
but
he
heard
the
soft
breathing
of
the
olifants
and
at
least
some
of
them
must
have
gone
to
the
jungle
and
returned
for
there
was
a
steady
munching
of
coarse
leaves
he
thought
pets
one
of
his
ten
thousand
gifts
we
can
never
live
long
enough
to
assess
his
laughter
was
another
wright
was
talking
placidly
we
suppose
it
must
have
been
a
similar
story
on
this
planet
elis
the
major
patterns
are
the
same
the
small
and
simple
forms
must
have
grown
to
greater
complexity
through
their
millions
of
years
undoubtedly
in
the
seas
the
good
saline
medium
for
our
kind
then
other
millions
of
years
while
the
first
creatures
to
try
the
land
were
clumsy
amphibians
still
needing
the
sea
but
developing
ways
to
carry
it
with
them
venture
a
little
further
there
no
hurry
in
history
and
before
the
beginning
of
life
difficult
elis
we
think
there
are
other
theories
that
each
star
with
planets
was
once

binary
our
astronomers

and

near
to

delicately
in
an
extremity
of
pain
and
not
to
him

nisana
was
looking
up
a
little
afraid
uncertain
princess
only
pakriaa
nisana
i
saw
how
you
spoke
to
the
vestoian
how
she
was
quiet
if
you
will
bring
her
and
tejron
too
and
we
go
and
listen
tocwright
is
talking
about
the
stars
the
world
i
think
maybe
we
tell
her
what
he
says

her
bow
an
earthen
flask
of
wine
brought
to
maturity
by
nisana
and
had
slipped
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
whitebeach
river
for
a
maiden
voyage
a
circuit
of
the
island
including
the
passage
of
a
strait
where
a
current
from
open
ocean
ran
formidably
between
adelphi
and
a
small
nameless
island
in
the
south
since
then
she
had
journeyed
short
distances
up
and
down
the
coast
learning
her
own
fussy
ways
and
teaching
them
to
her
makers
had
been
a
clumsy
oared
raft
of
heroic
history
nine
lucifer
years
ago
roughly
the
equivalent
of
twelve
earth
years
had
not
only
brought
fifteen
survivors
of
a
war
to
the
island
she
had
also
broadened
and
repaired
returned
to
the
mainland
over
the
channel
to
pick
up
a
sixteenth
survivor
abara
and
the
gentle
white
beasts
he
had
refused
to
abandon
he
had
guided
them
south
through
seventy
miles
of
unknown
terrors
and
ten
miles
further
along
the
beach
until
it
came
to
an
end
at
sheer
cliffs
here
found
him
one
by
one
probably
no
one
but
abara
could
have
coaxed
them
aboard
had
ferried
all
five
of
the
olifants
across
during
the
rains
that
came
for
a
dark
ending
of
year
two
the
swollen
whitebeach
river
had
torn
from
her
moorings
and
she
had
been
swept
away
down
the
channel
now
she
would
be
driftwood
scattered
over
the
infinity
of
the
unexplored
she
was
remembered
still
in
existence
and
more
often
called
betsy
was
only
a
boxed
platform
with
outriggers
and
two
pairs
of
oars
with
four
giants
at
the
oars
and
a
favorable
current
she
could
approximate
three
miles
an
hour
and
carry
several
tons
she
had
been
built
in
the
year
four
and
was
still
busily
bringing
slabs
of
building
stone
from
the
base
of
the
coastal
range
the
stone
was
red
and
black
or
sometimes
purple
heavy
already
smoother
than
marble
without
polishing
unlike
any
common
stone
of
earth
it
was
so
hard
that
wind
and
sun
and
water
over
the
centuries
had
done
little
with
it
wright
believed
that
was
why
the
coastal
range
could
rise
to
such
heights
from
a
narrow
base
while
the
years
in
their
millions
had
turned
other
mountains
to
level
ground
the
glassy
rock
remained
it
could
be
broken
for
use
but
defied
erosion
like
a
diamond
was
unequivocally
a
ship
after
her
trial
paul
had
carved
for
her
bow
a
figurehead
with
the
dreaming
face
of
pakriaa
maybe
dunin
said
with
a
few
more
like
this
the
first
explorations
could
be
around
the
coast
instead
of
overland
if
we
had
two
or
three
more
ships
when
is
old
enough
to
go
paul
knew
dorothy
had
winced
though
her
face
was
turned
to
the
field
of
water
if
he
still
wants
it
when
he
old
enough
to
go
wright
her
child
and
only
son
had
been
born
in
the
year
three
in
earth
years
he
was
only
nine
his
hunger
for
the
long
journeying
might
be
mainly
a
reflection
of
his
devotion
to
dunin
herself
full
of
visions
and
not
yet
a
woman
a
tentative
half
joke
a
means
of
channeling
a
child
fantasy
into
patience
had
somehow
become
a
sober
adult
plan
that
the
first
major
explorations
would
begin
when
would
have
a
man
strength
to
take
part
in
them
we
might
have
such
ships
by
then
paul
tried
to
sound
judicial
say
the
year
eighteen
or
nineteen
yes
a
coastal
exploration
might
be
better
than
trying
to
cross
the
continent
not
a
circumnavigation
though
at
first
dunin
big
face
blossomed
in
a
grin
only
about
thousand
miles
by
the
old
map
made
from
the
air
open
water
at
north
and
south
poles
plenty
of
it
could
do
it
in
less
than
a
year
more
like
fifty
thousand
allowing
for
deflections
tacking
pull
of
currents
we
do
know
storms
flat
calms
contrary
winds
repairs
expeditions
ashore
for
provisions
you
pull
your
horns
in
just
a
bit
my
girl
do
you
remember
a
desert
plateau
the
map
shows
in
the
southern
hemisphere
solid
cliff
rising
out
of
the
sea
for
over
seven
hundred
miles
and
on
top
of
it
roasting
sand
all
the
way
across
the
continent
and
that
plateau
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
coastal
desolation
down
there
from
the
equator
to
the
parallel
i
think
you
have
a
chance
to
go
ashore
and
nothing
to
help
you
if
you
did
dunin
still
grinned
just
sail
past
it
yes
well
out
to
sea
with
the
equatorial
sun
at
work
on
you
very
few
islands
in
that
region
some
of
them
bare
rock
and
he
thought
i
might
go
myself
i
am
fifty
now
in
earth
years
a
young
fifty
he
knew
also
that
dorothy
would
not
prevent
him
she
would
not
go
herself
she
would
remain
at
adelphi
faithful
to
the
daily
things
undramatic
labors
and
loyalties
that
make
civilization
something
more
than
a
vision
she
was
a
young
though
she
had
already
borne
five
children
if
he
went
away
she
would
mind
the
watch
fires
on
the
beaches
as
she
had
done
nine
years
ago
she
would
work
in
the
school
the
house
the
gardens
stand
by
christopher
wright
during
the
depressions
that
sometimes
overcame
him
she
would
grow
old
waiting
therefore
paul
knew
he
would
never
leave
her
the
explorations
will
come
in
good
time
dunin
he
said
you
have
years
to
watch
and
take
part
i
think
you
live
to
see
the
other
continent
too
and
the
great
islands
in
the
southwest
in
the
meantime
there
so
much
exploring
to
be
done
right
here
he
watched
the
water
too
aware
of
dorothy
face
turned
to
him
sober
and
appraising
you
know
dunin
that
island
we
visited
today
that
could
hold
a
community
of
a
thousand
between
its
two
little
hills
and
i
remembering
the
one
forty
miles
north
of
us
was
swept
ashore
there
get
doc
to
tell
you
that
story
sometime
i
was
sick
for
a
week
and
laid
up
in
one
of
the
limestone
caves
while
the
others
repaired
the
raft
a
round
island
less
than
five
miles
across
we
might
sail
there
next
trip
the
other
continent
dunin
murmured
and
she
watched
the
rising
mound
of
adelphi
in
the
south
the
islands
of
the
southwest
dorothy
leaned
against
the
rail
looking
northeast
saying
lightly
there
he
is
the
stone
figure
in
the
coastal
range
grew
visible
as
the
channel
current
pressed
them
a
little
too
far
eastward
the
vast
features
were
not
clear
one
could
find
the
line
of
shoulder
and
sears
said
looks
west
of
the
sun
was
it
long
ago
you
told
me
that
paul
in
a
way
it
was
penny
for
dorothy
oh
her
brown
face
crinkled
in
the
way
he
hoped
for
i
was
climbing
down
off
philosophy
with
my
usual
bump
wondering
what
hell
the
twins
have
been
raising
while
we
away
brodaa
patience
with
them
passes
belief
with
her
own
three
sets
of
twins
she
had
practice
i
wish
pak
could
have
had
children
late
middle
age
for
her
people
helen
going
to
make
a
better
med
student
than
ever
i
was
do
you
think
paul
seems
like
more
than
just
a
enthusiasm
i
think
so
and
sears
plump
daughter
teddy
would
no
doubt
find
herself
too
sometime
there
was
no
hurry
even
christopher
wright
no
longer
seemed
to
feel
that
time
was
hounding
him
though
his
years
by
the
earth
calendar
were
his
hair
and
beard
were
white
his
wiry
thinness
moved
deliberately
to
save
the
strength
he
had
once
been
able
to
spend
like
unconsidered
gold
look
dorothy
said
carefully
but
that
is
impossible
a
column
of
smoke
on
the
flank
of
the
coastal
range
above
one
of
the
beaches
where
building
stone
was
found
against
the
red
and
black
it
rose
straight
in
untroubled
air
they
were
taking
betsy
out
till
we
got
back
too
high
anyway
dunin
said
no
need
to
climb
so
high
for
the
stone
dorothy
whispered
i
have
quite
believed
that
ed
and
ann
oh
dorothy
well
we
yes
i
saw
the
lifeboat
go
down
on
the
channel
it
did
sink
she
shut
her
eyes
it
was
a
misty
evening
lover
more
ways
than
one
remember
dunin
i
always
remember
paul
i
know
that
when
the
current
below
the
island
took
the
lifeboat
it
must
have
been
smashed
against
the
cliffs
oh
of
course
and
for
nine
years
the
sea
spiders
will
have
used
the
pieces
of
it
for
their
little
castles
and
hideaways
all
the
same
ed
and
ann
could
have
managed
to
swim
ashore
cross
the
range
somehow
or
go
around
it
nothing
to
eat
barren
rock
straight
up
from
the
beaches
where
there
are
any
beaches
for
ninety
miles
south
of
the
only
place
where
they
could
have
landed
and
for
twenty
miles
north
of
it
but
no
kaksmas
in
the
coast
range
either
no
omasha
this
side
there
beaches
here
and
there
they
might
have
found
shellfish
blue
seaweed
nine
years
it
smoke
our
people
would
be
up
there
you
never
wanted
to
talk
much
about
that
day
no
i
have
i
did
behave
too
well
myself
yes
there
are
things
i
never
told
paul
ed
spearman
was
like
somebody
i
did
know
he
did
say
in
so
many
words
that
he
planned
to
go
to
vestoia
not
to
to
throw
himself
on
the
mercy
of
lantis
but
to
her
civilization
he
said
we
tried
ann
and
i
tried
to
reason
with
him
against
that
i
think
he
had
some
alternative
plan
maybe
flying
south
of
vestoia
as
far
as
the
fuel
would
take
him
and
starting
a
community
of
his
own
with
ann
and
me
you
know
and
himself
the
old
man
of
the
tribe
and
without
us
said
dunin
mildly
yes
dear
i
recall
that
he
put
that
in
words
in
a
way
paul
did
not
want
her
to
go
on
living
it
over
again
but
she
had
a
need
to
speak
of
it
i
suppose
his
plans
made
a
kind
of
sense
if
you
accepted
the
premise
as
i
could
of
course
when
he
said
you
were
all
lost
i
believed
i
had
to
believe
that
he
was
not
lying
perhaps
but
telling
something
he
had
truly
seen
i
know
that
was
where
i
let
go
i
raged
and
screamed
and
when
he
grabbed
my
arm
probably
just
wanting
to
quiet
me
down
well
if
he
living
he
have
two
or
three
white
scars
down
his
cheek
the
dope
comes
clean
i
ever
think
i
was
trying
to
get
hold
of
my
pistol
when
arek
took
it
away
and
took
his
away
too
after
that
she
forced
him
to
give
a
precise
account
of
everything
that
had
happened
every
detail
she
made
him
tell
it
five
or
six
times
watching
for
contradictions
she
was
justice
embodied
i
was
afraid
of
her
myself
even
while
i
loved
her
for
it
i
knew
what
he
told
us
then
was
the
truth
the
fuel
was
low
he
come
direct
to
the
island
with
no
real
knowledge
of
what
had
happened
to
you
he
was
saner
after
the
telling
he
lost
a
a
certain
look
of
exalted
listening
as
if
somebody
behind
arek
shoulder
were
telling
him
what
to
do
arek
never
gave
back
his
pistol
we
were
on
the
beach
the
giants
had
been
bringing
wood
all
day
for
a
beacon
fire
i
remember
the
exact
shape
of
a
big
shell
at
my
feet
the
look
of
a
bit
of
driftwood
tossed
in
by
the
channel
breakers
and
ann
oh
ann
tom
two
or
three
ways
as
usual
she
was
very
much
in
love
with
him
you
know
from
our
first
days
on
lucifer
but
her
mind
was
a
battleground
with
no
armistice
i
think
ed
always
knew
that
when
he
pleaded
with
her
reasonably
too
she
could
think
she
could
only
cry
and
say
wo
go
with
you
i
wo
go
he
stopped
trying
suddenly
as
if
he
knowingly
turned
off
a
light
inside
himself
unsteady
light
and
the
only
one
he
had
i
reckon
he
said
much
for
the
human
race
but
i
see
what
one
man
can
do
here
before
i
dead
without
issue
and
he
walked
off
to
the
lifeboat
while
arek
let
his
pistol
dangle
from
her
finger
and
paul
i
shall
always
think
he
knew
ann
would
run
after
him
i
saw
her
tugging
trying
to
pull
him
out
of
the
boat
but
she
was
pulled
in
and
it
was
gone
and
i
remember
said
dunin
what
you
did
after
we
lost
sight
of
it
what
i
did
what
was
that
dunin
i
blank
there
you
went
to
the
beacon
fire
and
put
on
more
wood
well
she
said
vaguely
of
course
we
all
did
that
smoke
paul
lantis
pygmies
or
the
wild
giants
could
be
there
on
the
cliffs
dunin
said
oh
there
are
no
giants
in
that
country
dorothy
those
low
hills
i
remember
west
of
the
first
camp
those
kaksma
hills
were
an
impassable
boundary
in
the
old
days
the
country
west
of
them
nobody
went
there
ever
and
south
of
them
vestoia
my
wild
kindred
are
all
very
far
north
of
here
eased
up
to
the
wharf
where
elis
and
arek
handled
her
like
a
toy
making
her
fast
with
ropes
of
a
fabric
as
good
as
linen
wright
was
there
with
them
and
tejron
and
pakriaa
and
nisana
who
were
inseparable
too
far
said
wright
and
handed
paul
the
field
glasses
just
smoke
elis
grumbled
what
up
there
to
burn
no
vegetation
rock
the
smoke
seemed
to
be
thinning
how
long
since
our
last
trip
over
eight
days
paul
tejron
recalled
my
impatient
eldest
wanted
to
see
if
he
could
handle
betsy
oars
remember
he
could
too
paul
remembered
pulled
his
weight
my
lady
yes
that
was
the
last
time
and
we
saw
nothing
unusual
only
nisana
thought
to
ask
good
voyage
today
paul
fine
darling
you
should
have
come
wright
was
carefully
calm
i
go
over
with
paul
elis
and
and
me
said
dorothy
not
smiling
well
okay
dope
pakriaa
thin
wrinkled
face
turned
to
him
nisana
and
i
miniaan
she
would
remember
the
vestoian
dialect
but
she
is
at
the
city
it
would
need
an
hour
to
send
for
her
and
then
it
would
be
getting
dark
yes
come
with
us
the
site
of
jensen
city
was
not
where
wright
and
paul
had
originally
dreamed
of
it
but
two
miles
south
where
the
radiance
of
sears
lake
hung
in
the
hills
a
gap
in
the
west
admitted
ocean
winds
the
outlet
of
the
lake
ran
for
a
mile
to
the
edge
of
a
red
stone
cliff
and
tumbled
over
in
a
waterfall
five
hundred
feet
high
there
would
one
day
be
houses
along
that
mile
of
river
already
near
the
waterfall
there
was
a
temple
of
red
and
black
stone
devoted
to
quiet
without
ritual
thought
of
sometimes
as
a
memorial
to
sears
and
to
the
other
dead
more
often
simply
as
a
place
to
go
for
the
satisfactions
of
silence
it
had
no
name
paul
hoped
it
would
never
have
one
miniaan
of
vestoia
was
an
eager
citizen
the
old
wound
had
left
one
side
of
her
head
cruelly
scarred
from
the
other
side
she
was
beautiful
by
charin
as
well
as
pygmy
standards
younger
than
pakriaa
she
was
the
mother
of
four
by
kajana
the
archer
whom
mijok
had
once
carried
on
his
shield
who
would
never
walk
again
nor
live
a
day
without
pain
and
who
was
more
cheerful
as
a
permanent
habit
of
mind
than
any
of
the
other
pygmy
survivors
of
that
war
the
pygmy
children
of
jensen
city
were
all
fathered
by
abara
and
kajana
a
fact
which
caused
old
abara
to
draw
comparisons
between
himself
and
mister
johnson
and
to
grow
darkly
desperate
when
kajana
wistfully
asked
him
to
explain
why
it
was
a
joke
elis
shipped
the
oars
paul
let
down
the
anchor
a
heavy
block
of
stone
in
two
fathoms
of
blackening
water
elis
lifted
the
dugout
over
the
side
and
held
it
for
them
he
himself
swam
the
short
distance
to
the
beach
and
eased
the
canoe
through
the
shallows
even
now
at
low
tide
there
was
barely
a
quarter
mile
of
gray
sand
between
water
and
cliffs
chipping
away
of
building
stone
had
created
a
fair
path
a
hundred
feet
up
beyond
natural
irregularities
made
it
possible
to
climb
another
two
hundred
to
the
first
setback
of
the
great
sea
wall
a
ledge
which
ran
only
as
far
as
the
next
patch
of
beach
five
miles
south
sunset
had
been
ending
when
came
home
here
there
was
a
depth
of
evening
quiet
no
sign
of
smoke
or
life
no
sound
but
the
long
hiss
and
moaning
of
small
waves
we
might
make
a
fire
here
wright
said
but
there
enough
light
they
they
must
have
seen
there
dorothy
said
and
ran
up
the
sand
the
others
watched
in
frozen
helplessness
as
the
woman
came
down
the
crude
cliff
path
gaunt
seeming
tall
only
because
of
the
gauntness
flaring
ribs
thighs
fallen
in
every
arm
bone
visible
her
hair
was
black
disorder
to
her
waist
her
body
a
battleground
of
bruises
dirt
scars
old
and
new
and
she
winced
away
from
dorothy
with
protesting
hands
you
must
touch
me
because
i
very
dirty
but
i
know
who
you
are
besides
i
had
to
burn
the
last
of
my
clothes
my
baby
died
i
know
who
you
are
you
see
my
milk
stopped
dorothy
leeds
i
left
him
on
the
cliff
matron
would
not
approve
you
see
ann
ann
i
have
two
other
sons
but
this
one
died
on
the
cliff
i
used
to
know
a
man
who
called
me
miss
sarasate
but
that
was
just
his
way
of
talking
i
do
happen
to
be
in
practice
still
trying
to
fend
off
dorothy
arms
ann
fell
on
her
face
pakriaa
was
speaking
softly
in
the
room
where
ann
was
sleeping
wright
room
she
will
be
healed
pakriaa
said
i
can
remember
and
you
remember
it
too
paul
how
my
own
mind
refused
to
be
my
servant
for
a
while
since
ann
had
been
brought
to
jensen
city
pakriaa
and
nisana
had
never
left
her
the
little
women
both
now
far
from
youth
took
on
the
duties
of
nursing
with
a
fierce
protectiveness
so
that
there
was
little
for
even
dorothy
to
do
ann
had
slept
heavily
all
night
and
morning
at
noon
the
house
remained
cool
mild
air
entered
at
the
screenless
window
openings
stirring
the
wall
map
of
adelphi
and
the
three
of
paintings
which
were
the
only
decorations
wright
allowed
in
this
ascetic
shelter
there
was
now
but
in
such
a
climate
with
no
serious
insect
pests
it
seemed
a
waste
of
effort
to
make
windows
a
long
overhang
of
the
eaves
was
sufficient
against
the
rains
the
house
was
large
around
a
garden
courtyard
open
toward
sears
lake
the
walls
were
of
black
stone
the
roof
of
a
material
indistinguishable
from
slate
carried
by
hardwood
timbers
wright
shared
this
house
with
mijok
and
arek
pakriaa
nisana
miniaan
and
their
children
and
arek
there
were
five
other
such
communal
houses
overlooking
the
lake
a
seventh
was
building
the
children
were
everywhere
it
was
and
would
be
for
many
years
a
city
of
the
young
rak
had
died
in
the
year
four
a
matter
of
falling
asleep
without
waking
but
kamon
lived
sharing
a
house
with
tejron
paul
and
dorothy
brodaa
and
kajana
lately
sears
daughter
had
taken
over
the
task
of
caring
for
kajana
in
his
helplessness
lifting
him
to
and
from
a
wheel
chair
that
paul
and
mijok
had
contrived
or
carrying
him
to
a
hammock
slung
near
the
waterfall
where
he
could
watch
the
ocean
and
its
changes
in
middle
age
kajana
had
taught
himself
to
write
and
kept
a
journal
of
the
colony
with
a
sober
passion
for
detail
ann
had
not
waked
when
dorothy
and
nisana
washed
her
and
clipped
the
dreadful
tangle
of
her
hair
she
will
be
healed
pakriaa
insisted
maybe
in
the
next
waking
and
when
ann
gray
eyes
came
open
an
hour
later
they
did
show
a
measuring
sanity
recognizing
dorothy
and
paul
but
wincing
away
when
nisana
smiled
and
touched
her
do
not
be
afraid
of
us
pakriaa
whispered
we
are
still
proud
but
our
pride
now
is
that
no
one
is
afraid
of
us
you
came
to
my
house
in
the
old
old
days
remember
my
blue
house
and
i
thinking
i
would
be
queen
of
the
world
i
laugh
at
that
now
do
not
look
at
what
i
was
ann
pakriaa
paul
you
have
changed
much
one
of
our
other
friends
is
about
to
bring
a
meal
why
paul
you
must
be
fifty
earth
calendar
dorothy
said
we
measure
it
in
lucifer
years
pretty
please
nicer
paul
admitted
that
way
i
around
ann
you
let
see
one
earth
year
one
point
three
eight
damn
mental
arithmetic
let
call
you
half
past
imagine
that
ann
achieved
a
smile
and
pakriaa
see
already
i
am
an
old
woman
and
ugly
do
be
absurd
pak
dorothy
said
and
this
lady
you
would
not
remember
me
said
nisana
oh
but
i
do
i
do
you
voted
for
paul
pakriaa
chuckled
with
unforced
gaiety
politics
nisana
chirped
i
got
the
job
paul
pinched
her
tiny
ear
lobe
and
stepped
out
to
the
kitchen
where
he
found
wright
with
arek
the
children
were
at
school
with
brodaa
mijok
and
miniaan
ordinarily
wright
would
have
been
there
too
when
the
youngest
of
this
house
were
through
with
lessons
they
would
go
wandering
in
the
hills
with
mijok
and
muson
so
that
ann
might
have
quiet
with
only
distant
sounds
of
the
laughter
and
playing
in
sunlight
she
awake
paul
said
and
wright
hurried
to
the
bedroom
but
arek
lingered
filling
a
tray
arek
had
grown
almost
to
mijok
height
filling
out
a
red
mother
goddess
still
bemused
by
inner
discoveries
her
fine
fingers
fussed
at
the
earthen
dishes
on
the
wooden
tray
no
ambition
no
achievement
nothing
i
think
could
be
worth
the
price
of
happened
to
her
whether
she
recovers
completely
or
not
there
human
right
and
wrong
i
think
sometimes
paul
it
not
necessary
to
do
much
wondering
you
can
look
straight
at
a
thing
and
say
ought
not
to
be
granted
paul
said
watching
the
garden
through
the
broad
kitchen
window
his
eldest
helen
must
have
elected
to
do
a
little
work
after
school
instead
of
strolling
away
with
the
others
she
was
weeding
her
brown
head
sheltered
from
the
sun
by
an
improvised
hat
of
leaves
but
for
that
she
was
prettily
naked
as
the
day
she
was
born
and
though
she
was
humming
to
herself
she
restrained
the
sound
so
that
paul
could
hardly
hear
it
she
saw
him
in
the
window
and
grinned
and
waved
she
had
most
of
dorothy
warm
coloring
with
paul
slimness
arek
saw
her
too
and
smiled
what
ann
should
have
had
too
paul
i
told
you
once
we
love
you
all
the
good
new
things
we
have
your
work
all
the
same
there
a
devil
in
some
of
you
as
in
us
too
of
course
need
of
the
laws
is
obvious
if
spearman
is
responsible
the
vestoians
too
maybe
then
i
think
we
live
in
too
much
seclusion
here
she
took
up
the
tray
too
easy
to
live
all
the
time
in
paradise
and
leave
things
undone
yes
vestoia
is
big
arek
or
was
when
it
almost
destroyed
us
true
but
you
tell
me
that
over
there
on
the
beach
she
said
have
two
other
sons
living
did
she
mean
we
must
find
them
and
spearman
too
i
believe
she
can
tell
us
about
it
soon
understood
that
i
go
with
you
when
you
find
them
yes
yes
arek
in
the
bedroom
arek
manner
was
altogether
changed
observe
this
is
asonis
à
la
mode
whatever
that
means
all
i
did
was
roast
it
these
are
paul
says
lima
beans
munchausen
and
here
we
have
asparagus
and
by
the
way
the
cheese
tastes
it
smells
cheese
asonis
milk
said
wright
they
moo
too
oh
you
tamed
them
pain
fought
with
interest
in
the
haggard
face
yes
ed
wanted
to
do
that
but
we
somehow
we
never
if
you
good
arek
said
and
eat
all
that
there
cake
you
found
something
for
sugar
ca
tell
it
from
terrestrial
dorothy
chattered
only
it
pink
from
a
tree
fruit
sort
of
like
a
plum
we
have
a
plantation
of
across
the
lake
you
boil
it
down
to
nothing
and
the
sugar
crystallizes
out
we
make
another
kind
from
sap
not
as
good
as
maple
flour
that
from
the
same
old
wheat
that
came
from
earth
miniaan
oh
you
do
know
her
yet
miniaan
and
paul
have
experimented
around
with
the
local
grass
grains
nothing
yet
that
measures
up
to
wheat
ann
picked
at
the
food
crying
weakly
at
the
first
mouthful
ah
do
do
that
said
dorothy
looking
away
you
came
home
that
all
later
she
ate
ravenously
i
want
to
tell
you
it
took
a
long
time
in
telling
once
she
fell
asleep
but
woke
an
hour
later
obsessed
with
a
need
to
continue
the
lifeboat
drifted
south
its
last
remnant
of
fuel
gone
in
a
mad
effort
to
leap
the
coastal
range
water
sneaked
in
at
the
seal
of
the
floor
window
damaged
in
an
earlier
landing
and
ed
spearman
talked
to
himself
fugitives
from
a
sunday
school
we
live
like
a
hurt
boy
he
said
we
show
when
the
current
beyond
the
island
swept
them
toward
the
cliffs
he
opened
the
door
and
pulled
ann
into
the
water
dragging
her
forgetting
that
she
was
herself
a
strong
swimmer
later
on
the
beach
he
was
tender
trying
to
comfort
and
reassure
her
with
a
vision
of
the
future
abundantly
real
to
him
they
had
no
food
no
way
to
light
a
fire
of
driftwood
they
would
go
to
vestoia
he
said
convince
lantis
that
they
were
friends
with
something
to
offer
her
empire
they
would
bring
her
civilization
from
this
beach
there
seemed
to
be
no
passage
north
they
could
have
found
one
by
climbing
high
into
the
range
ann
did
so
nine
years
later
but
spearman
found
a
ledge
of
sorts
running
south
it
might
take
them
the
miles
to
the
lower
end
of
the
range
or
give
out
at
any
point
trapping
them
it
did
give
out
twice
both
times
rather
than
clamber
higher
on
the
cliffs
spearman
hurled
his
famished
body
through
the
breakers
and
swam
south
aided
by
the
current
until
it
was
possible
to
continue
along
the
rocks
ann
followed
not
quite
wishing
for
the
death
the
ocean
could
have
given
easily
they
kept
alive
with
shellfish
and
seaweed
washed
ashore
and
small
crustaceans
that
hid
in
the
tide
lines
and
in
crannies
of
wet
rock
there
were
pools
of
rain
water
and
violent
small
streams
plunging
down
the
range
it
took
them
fifty
days
to
cover
the
eighty
miles
i
think
i
spent
a
hundred
coming
back
ann
said
could
swim
with
the
baby
it
would
have
been
against
the
current
anyway
climbed
sometimes
went
back
miles
from
a
dead
end
to
try
again
in
the
afternoons
the
sun
pressed
on
them
with
total
fury
then
they
could
only
crawl
into
what
shadow
the
rocks
gave
and
wait
for
the
torture
to
cease
but
at
last
there
were
trees
level
ground
in
a
few
miles
a
rapid
friendly
river
are
there
rivers
here
i
forgotten
nothing
prettier
in
the
world
i
let
that
one
close
over
me
ed
pulled
me
out
we
had
to
go
on
there
were
five
more
of
those
bright
leaping
coastal
streams
in
a
journey
of
another
fifty
miles
southeast
through
good
country
where
the
great
range
thinned
out
into
rolling
jungle
and
meadowland
there
were
asonis
and
small
game
spearman
made
himself
weapons
ann
could
remember
these
days
almost
with
pleasure
they
had
she
said
something
the
flavor
of
a
delayed
childhood
a
glimpse
of
eden
spearman
was
for
a
time
simply
a
strong
and
intelligent
man
measuring
himself
against
nature
for
survival
master
of
a
simple
environment
with
none
to
question
his
decisions
and
no
social
complexities
to
warp
them
i
wished
we
could
settle
in
that
country
the
two
of
us
i
even
begged
for
it
he
had
to
go
on
from
the
remembered
map
spearman
knew
there
was
an
obscure
pygmy
settlement
south
of
the
end
of
the
range
some
fifty
miles
below
vestoia
merely
a
cluster
of
parallel
lines
that
had
appeared
in
the
photographs
it
might
or
might
not
be
a
part
of
the
empire
of
lantis
it
was
near
the
headwaters
of
a
seventh
river
which
flowed
not
to
the
coast
but
eastward
into
the
deep
wide
violent
outlet
of
lake
argo
he
never
told
me
why
he
was
following
that
river
so
cautiously
until
we
reached
the
villages
and
history
repeated
itself
the
villages
were
a
furtive
chronically
frightened
community
they
knew
of
vestoia
but
believed
correctly
that
the
groping
tentacles
of
empire
had
not
yet
found
them
lantis
drive
was
mainly
to
the
east
where
the
country
was
easier
and
pygmy
settlements
were
numerous
even
her
war
against
pakriaa
people
had
been
a
diversion
more
a
matter
of
hurt
pride
than
gainful
conquest
between
these
hidden
villages
and
vestoia
there
were
meadows
dangerous
with
omasha
and
some
swampland
below
the
two
small
vestoian
lakes
the
current
of
the
river
argo
was
too
fierce
for
the
flimsy
boats
of
lantis
so
the
villages
of
the
seventh
river
under
a
sly
but
feeble
queen
waited
like
a
rabbit
in
a
hedge
with
sharply
calculated
drama
but
smiling
this
time
ann
said
like
a
pleased
teacher
at
a
blackboard
ed
spearman
overturned
another
idol
and
became
a
god
at
the
end
of
two
years
when
spearman
goddess
had
borne
him
twin
sons
there
was
industry
in
the
villages
there
was
an
army
of
a
thousand
spears
bladed
with
iron
from
certain
small
hills
in
the
north
between
vestoia
and
spearman
city
these
hills
were
dangerous
with
burrows
but
workers
of
a
particular
kind
could
be
made
to
go
there
the
soldiers
overcame
their
distaste
for
the
bow
when
they
had
watched
the
course
of
arrows
properly
vaned
and
tipped
with
iron
or
bronze
they
did
not
need
to
be
taught
how
to
hate
vestoia
nevertheless
they
relished
it
when
spearman
decided
that
political
realities
demanded
he
should
tell
them
an
epic
tale
the
tale
of
a
war
he
and
companion
gods
had
waged
against
that
place
vengeance
divine
or
human
was
a
thing
the
pygmies
had
understood
from
the
first
biting
and
scratching
of
infancy
ann
had
been
bewildered
by
that
first
gust
of
oratory
against
vestoia
spearman
had
neglected
to
prepare
her
for
it
during
the
long
two
years
spent
in
teaching
the
pygmies
a
limited
english
and
the
beginnings
of
industry
it
might
not
have
been
clear
to
himself
that
such
a
move
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
hold
his
people
enthusiasm
and
devotion
ann
wondered
you
had
thought
once
of
going
to
vestoia
spearman
turned
on
her
with
an
anger
partly
cynical
humor
they
hurt
us
did
they
oh
i
might
have
toyed
with
the
idea
as
a
choice
of
evils
before
we
found
our
real
friends
they
killed
doc
did
they
and
paul
and
sears
and
those
milky
giant
friends
of
ours
but
you
did
see
spearman
believed
now
that
he
had
seen
the
full
end
of
that
war
ann
got
it
through
her
head
after
a
while
when
he
said
that
vestoia
must
be
punished
for
past
wrongs
there
was
a
smiling
half
admission
of
disingenuous
policy
it
work
he
said
we
can
get
away
with
it
but
the
death
of
all
the
others
except
dorothy
had
become
for
him
something
like
an
article
of
faith
not
to
be
examined
at
this
moment
ann
said
she
had
begun
to
think
of
a
northward
journey
but
the
odds
were
darkly
against
it
the
twins
were
still
nursing
and
sickly
the
demands
of
mere
daily
living
are
heavy
on
a
goddess
who
must
also
supervise
housekeeping
there
was
for
instance
the
endless
squabbling
treachery
of
the
household
slaves
at
that
time
also
ann
hoped
to
soften
or
divert
some
changes
that
seemed
to
be
taking
place
in
spearman
himself
i
wonder
if
they
were
really
changes
spearman
detested
slavery
he
said
but
in
a
primitive
economy
how
else
could
you
get
the
work
done
even
in
daylight
when
the
kaksmas
were
half
helpless
only
the
bravest
soldiers
would
go
into
those
hills
not
to
work
but
only
as
guards
for
the
chained
lines
of
laborers
guards
who
could
run
fast
if
the
kaksmas
came
out
for
a
attack
and
leave
the
slaves
to
be
consumed
bad
spearman
was
sorry
such
things
had
to
be
still
the
slaves
were
poor
or
sometimes
dangerous
material
at
best
besides
that
they
hated
responsibility
and
were
therefore
really
happier
in
slavery
and
received
better
care
than
they
could
otherwise
have
had
so
you
had
to
see
it
as
almost
a
eugenic
even
a
humanitarian
measure
as
well
as
an
unavoidable
transitional
phase
and
in
any
case
you
ca
make
an
omelette
without
breaking
eggs
at
the
use
of
meat
slaves
for
the
palace
household
spearman
had
to
draw
the
line
and
he
instituted
laws
against
the
custom
for
the
rest
of
his
little
kingdom
but
they
were
difficult
to
enforce
without
compromising
matters
of
greater
political
importance
transitional
became
a
somewhat
sacred
word
for
spearman
over
the
years
a
sustaining
conception
when
things
went
badly
and
when
his
ingrained
sensitivities
brought
from
earth
were
violated
by
the
brisk
of
a
neolithic
culture
even
the
first
war
against
vestoia
in
the
third
year
of
deification
was
part
of
a
transitional
phase
although
spearman
did
not
feel
that
his
pygmies
were
advanced
enough
to
be
troubled
with
fine
distinctions
it
is
better
for
a
god
to
resist
pressures
for
explanation
that
first
war
was
well
planned
with
limited
objective
six
hundred
spearwomen
and
archers
crossed
the
argo
below
vestoia
and
fell
on
the
city
from
the
east
so
that
there
was
no
clue
to
their
southern
origin
they
set
afire
a
mile
of
the
lake
settlement
took
three
hundred
captives
and
vanished
again
eastward
leaving
a
few
crippled
defenders
to
convey
the
message
that
they
would
come
again
it
had
the
desired
effect
the
armies
of
lantis
foamed
eastward
like
crazed
hornets
while
spearman
force
slipped
home
across
the
argo
without
a
trace
in
the
following
year
they
struck
again
again
from
the
east
but
with
a
larger
force
laying
waste
nearly
a
third
of
that
part
of
the
city
on
the
eastern
shores
of
the
vestoian
lakes
the
palace
of
lantis
nerve
center
of
empire
was
on
the
west
shore
probably
the
queen
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
until
she
saw
the
far
shore
buried
in
smoke
and
by
the
time
she
crossed
over
she
would
have
learned
only
that
spearman
army
had
promised
to
come
a
third
time
and
take
lantis
herself
and
assume
command
of
the
empire
they
did
just
six
years
after
that
lonely
journey
along
the
rocks
ann
twin
sons
were
five
years
old
five
lucifer
years
in
the
first
two
campaigns
spearman
had
not
shown
himself
in
person
to
the
vestoians
in
this
third
battle
he
was
at
the
head
of
his
army
massive
and
tall
with
a
cold
unhappy
precision
he
was
using
a
long
hardwood
stick
with
a
semicircular
blade
and
this
time
his
legion
had
driven
in
out
of
the
west
directly
against
the
palace
and
the
temples
and
sacred
places
of
the
queen
of
the
world
lantis
was
aging
then
and
sick
and
bewildered
she
probably
never
understood
that
it
was
merely
a
question
of
her
own
methods
being
used
against
her
even
when
her
city
was
in
flames
around
her
and
her
people
were
scattering
into
forest
and
swamp
and
lake
she
could
neither
yield
nor
destroy
herself
thus
it
was
her
misfortune
to
be
taken
alive
a
week
later
ann
and
the
children
were
brought
by
litter
from
spearman
city
spearman
recognized
the
political
advantage
almost
necessity
of
their
presence
at
the
triumph
lantis
was
ceremonially
dragged
through
the
and
stinking
streets
and
forced
to
drink
an
infusion
of
the
weed
that
destroyed
the
self
this
was
pygmy
custom
which
spearman
watched
in
regretful
disgust
anxious
that
his
small
sons
should
preserve
the
impassive
dignity
proper
to
gods
they
far
from
human
you
know
they
do
feel
things
as
we
do
the
boys
were
puzzled
and
curious
so
far
as
ann
knew
however
lantis
was
not
eaten
at
the
festival
he
told
me
she
was
mercifully
put
away
after
the
excitement
died
down
and
another
meat
slave
was
sacrificed
made
up
to
look
like
lantis
not
deception
but
ritual
substitution
ed
felt
he
achieved
quite
a
step
in
progress
there
it
showed
he
said
they
were
beginning
to
accept
ritual
for
reality
under
the
influence
of
oh
the
devil
with
it
he
moved
his
capital
to
vestoia
the
palace
was
restored
modernized
i
lived
there
two
and
a
half
years
where
i
bore
him
another
son
i
never
know
how
i
came
to
allow
it
a
kind
of
madness
hate
close
to
love
something
he
want
me
any
more
you
know
he
had
some
ideas
about
ascetic
discipline
purity
i
do
know
what
exactly
and
he
did
try
to
explain
it
to
me
i
hated
him
with
all
my
mind
for
years
before
the
vestoian
wars
but
i
not
a
good
hater
i
even
still
imagined
i
could
influence
him
a
little
until
the
baby
was
born
and
he
was
in
black
despair
because
it
was
a
daughter
i
had
to
escape
i
could
feel
my
mind
my
self
rotting
away
dissolving
as
the
vestoian
empire
was
dissolving
for
that
matter
he
could
hold
them
it
began
to
fall
apart
right
away
they
were
terrified
of
him
and
of
his
spearman
city
bodyguards
weasels
they
simply
drifted
away
into
the
woods
and
did
come
back
i
doubt
if
they
organized
anywhere
else
lantis
must
have
had
a
rare
sort
of
skill
the
city
was
all
hers
she
built
it
out
of
stone
age
villagers
and
it
died
with
her
ed
tried
everything
to
keep
them
bribes
threats
endless
spying
and
public
executions
by
his
guard
bread
and
circuses
meaningless
offices
for
favorites
with
fancy
clothes
and
no
duties
it
work
at
the
time
i
escaped
the
population
was
down
to
he
never
tell
me
but
my
guess
is
under
ten
thousand
for
the
whole
city
there
was
an
epidemic
rather
like
flu
i
used
that
as
a
reason
to
take
the
baby
back
to
spearman
city
knowing
ed
would
need
to
stay
and
go
on
trying
to
hold
things
together
i
thought
he
would
let
me
take
the
twins
john
david
rest
awhile
said
arek
we
going
to
bring
them
home
too
ann
could
not
speak
how
would
you
like
to
bathe
again
in
our
lake
hold
you
up
water
warm
with
the
sun
best
part
of
the
day
i
like
it
it
so
pretty
what
do
you
call
it
sears
lake
sears
what
am
i
made
of
i
have
thought
or
asked
it
was
a
vestoian
arrow
wright
said
at
the
end
he
enjoyed
remembering
earth
the
city
is
a
desolation
miniaan
slipped
out
of
shadow
into
the
clearing
where
the
others
waited
for
her
without
a
fire
she
was
shaken
short
of
breath
no
longer
young
she
had
hurried
on
the
return
journey
from
vestoia
through
heat
of
jungle
i
could
not
even
find
the
house
where
i
was
born
oh
pakriaa
paul
of
every
ten
houses
seven
are
empty
the
streets
are
dirt
and
rubbish
no
one
knew
me
well
that
not
strange
those
i
met
supposed
i
was
a
stranger
probably
from
the
east
but
the
ones
who
were
suspicious
did
not
challenge
me
they
slipped
into
their
sorry
houses
and
stared
at
me
through
the
cracks
she
sat
down
in
weariness
wiping
sweat
from
her
scarred
head
and
shoulder
word
of
what
i
said
will
travel
quickly
but
not
one
followed
me
here
i
made
sure
of
that
arek
asked
have
you
had
anything
to
eat
no
i
only
walked
through
the
streets
doc
some
had
english
words
a
few
badly
spoken
no
one
could
pronounce
at
the
beginning
of
a
word
and
they
had
absurd
turns
of
speech
i
understand
one
woman
said
to
me
fella
goddamn
skirt
belong
you
what
name
i
thought
she
was
asking
about
this
skirt
i
made
in
the
old
fashion
but
then
we
spoke
in
the
old
tongue
i
found
she
only
wanted
to
know
who
i
was
and
where
i
came
from
it
seems
that
now
under
they
indicate
what
word
do
i
want
social
social
levels
castes
castes
that
is
it
paul
they
indicate
castes
by
the
color
of
a
skirt
in
the
old
days
there
were
only
two
castes
soldiers
and
voluntary
laborers
not
considering
the
family
of
lantis
or
the
slaves
at
the
bottom
now
there
are
oh
ten
twenty
i
do
know
those
who
work
at
the
dye
pots
must
never
do
anything
else
and
they
can
look
down
on
the
workers
in
hides
this
woman
was
a
maker
of
arrowheads
and
despised
both
i
told
her
and
some
others
that
i
was
a
stranger
from
a
distant
village
and
i
said
i
had
heard
by
rumor
of
other
gods
and
giants
who
would
come
one
day
soon
to
talk
with
yes
they
call
him
that
it
frightened
her
she
made
excuses
and
ran
away
i
told
it
to
another
an
old
woman
who
broke
out
cursing
and
weeping
she
said
oh
no
more
of
them
no
more
and
sat
down
in
the
street
and
scattered
dust
on
her
head
did
you
see
him
no
paul
i
saw
the
palace
changed
with
new
tall
doors
there
were
soldiers
at
the
entrance
so
i
did
not
dare
go
near
they
wore
a
headdress
it
was
the
old
bark
fabric
i
think
but
a
shape
i
never
saw
i
saw
the
great
stockade
always
the
biggest
thing
on
the
shore
of
north
lake
still
in
repair
there
was
the
same
sluice
to
wash
away
the
blood
of
the
meat
slaves
there
is
still
a
ferry
near
it
where
the
crossing
is
narrow
at
the
lake
inlet
i
could
see
across
streets
and
houses
and
outside
the
city
i
saw
a
mound
very
foul
once
the
city
was
clean
there
was
a
boy
playing
near
it
ran
when
he
saw
me
but
i
caught
him
and
asked
him
about
that
mound
i
could
hardly
understand
his
gabble
it
seems
that
nowadays
in
vestoia
children
have
reason
to
be
afraid
of
grown
women
when
we
could
talk
he
told
me
the
mound
was
the
grave
of
the
false
empress
the
wicked
one
everyone
who
passes
is
required
to
defile
it
a
law
pakriaa
laced
her
wrinkled
hands
at
her
throat
smiling
at
christopher
wright
quoting
a
few
of
his
own
words
laws
are
living
things
let
men
guard
them
against
crippling
and
disease
nisana
asked
what
is
next
to
do
we
sleep
on
it
wright
said
long
journey
we
tired
we
go
there
in
the
morning
with
our
weapons
of
course
but
mijok
said
softly
is
a
good
time
i
think
there
wo
be
any
fighting
miniaan
said
and
she
relaxed
and
leaned
happily
against
muson
plump
knee
and
ate
the
meal
arek
had
ready
for
her
in
fastidious
birdlike
bites
if
they
troubled
by
the
rumors
i
scattered
they
slip
away
and
hide
not
fight
they
weary
bewildered
disillusioned
people
at
least
that
is
the
temper
of
the
city
as
i
felt
it
nisana
murmured
with
spearman
bodyguard
it
could
be
different
why
said
wright
he
never
turn
them
against
us
not
if
he
the
man
i
used
to
know
or
anything
like
that
man
he
came
a
long
way
with
us
once
but
paul
had
to
wonder
he
ever
with
us
there
were
six
giants
in
the
party
mijok
arek
muson
elis
dunin
elis
was
the
year
governor
at
adelphi
but
dorothy
had
held
that
position
the
year
before
and
would
assume
its
simple
duties
in
his
absence
nisana
eldest
twin
daughters
had
wanted
to
come
but
nisana
had
not
allowed
it
requiring
them
to
stay
in
school
under
brodaa
temperate
discipline
the
only
pygmies
here
were
herself
pakriaa
and
miniaan
the
group
had
come
miles
overland
after
set
them
on
a
beach
north
of
the
coastal
range
this
had
seemed
better
than
taking
the
sloop
south
where
harbor
would
be
uncertain
and
the
winds
and
currents
unknown
the
first
twenty
miles
ashore
had
been
a
retracing
of
abara
journey
with
the
olifants
through
swampy
and
treacherous
jungle
after
rounding
the
range
they
could
follow
the
eastern
edge
of
the
grassland
that
spread
on
its
lee
side
traveling
in
the
open
only
at
night
to
avoid
omasha
for
all
of
one
day
they
were
bedeviled
by
a
swarm
of
biting
flies
and
since
there
were
brown
wings
circling
they
could
not
escape
into
full
sunlight
where
the
flies
would
not
follow
eventually
pakriaa
found
an
plant
and
remembered
its
use
from
old
times
the
juice
of
the
root
was
a
protection
the
smell
was
almost
as
distressing
as
the
bites
but
less
dangerous
miniaan
of
vestoia
had
never
heard
of
the
plant
use
perhaps
that
explained
why
vestoia
had
never
exploited
the
otherwise
pleasant
region
due
west
of
lake
argo
there
was
fitful
sleep
in
the
daylight
following
miniaan
return
and
then
an
evening
meal
arek
and
muson
and
the
two
young
giants
seemed
untroubled
by
tomorrow
full
of
speculative
curiosity
mijok
was
uneasy
though
he
would
not
put
it
in
words
elis
too
would
be
remembering
wright
said
again
he
came
a
long
way
with
us
jensen
chose
him
remember
that
chose
him
from
among
seven
hundred
other
physically
fine
youths
who
had
the
same
training
the
same
kind
of
courage
who
wanted
the
privilege
as
he
did
i
can
always
wonder
what
jensen
himself
would
have
made
of
lucifer
wright
said
almost
with
reproach
jensen
was
a
great
engineer
paul
but
he
was
also
a
student
of
history
compared
with
what
his
leadership
would
have
been
mine
has
been
weak
vacillating
academic
it
was
bound
to
be
i
take
credit
for
some
achievements
i
said
give
protoplasm
a
chance
we
have
done
that
established
the
climate
of
liberty
under
law
for
our
very
small
group
and
proved
that
a
human
mind
can
twenty
thousand
years
of
blundering
with
no
other
help
than
a
flexible
language
and
the
few
basic
rules
of
civilized
action
as
the
savages
of
earth
always
proved
it
whenever
they
had
a
chance
to
secure
a
genuine
education
and
fair
treatment
but
in
our
material
development
there
must
have
been
a
thousand
lost
opportunities
things
jensen
and
probably
ed
spearman
would
have
seen
at
once
paul
laughed
ed
could
have
designed
a
better
sloop
wright
dismissed
that
with
a
chuckle
ach
she
floats
boy
she
sails
when
i
get
angry
or
impatient
or
discouraged
when
i
stick
too
tight
to
a
plan
of
my
own
and
fail
to
hear
the
opposing
argument
then
i
remember
that
jensen
had
a
charity
a
patience
a
kindliness
almost
as
great
as
sears
had
tocwright
said
pakriaa
half
amused
why
do
you
search
yourself
must
you
always
be
sitting
in
judgment
on
your
own
mind
why
yes
dear
i
must
his
fingers
played
in
his
white
beard
origin
remember
my
fussy
little
of
the
the
first
book
dorothy
and
nisana
copied
out
for
me
when
we
found
how
to
make
good
paper
from
the
marsh
grass
but
is
a
not
limited
to
the
charin
tribe
pakriaa
ask
yourself
and
ask
elis
the
black
giant
smiled
so
i
go
on
with
it
just
a
little
paul
is
it
weakness
in
me
to
ask
that
when
we
find
ed
spearman
you
do
most
of
the
talking
i
want
to
be
merely
friendly
if
i
can
not
say
much
at
least
until
we
know
what
sort
of
man
he
become
nine
years
ago
i
do
think
he
ever
had
much
resentment
against
you
you
hear
both
sides
usually
the
surest
way
to
make
an
extremist
hate
you
bitterly
but
somehow
people
do
you
a
kindly
listener
i
only
try
to
be
pushing
down
a
big
part
of
my
natural
temperament
to
do
it
why
i
think
i
never
even
appreciated
the
full
nastiness
of
sarcasm
until
one
time
it
not
such
a
small
matter
one
time
on
the
space
ship
when
sears
reproached
me
for
it
something
that
went
against
his
own
nature
by
the
way
because
he
was
always
too
afraid
of
finding
fault
with
others
i
talk
with
him
first
doc
if
you
want
me
to
but
i
wonder
what
i
can
say
i
keep
seeing
ann
the
things
she
told
us
he
things
miniaan
has
told
us
today
a
city
that
never
was
said
miniaan
sleepily
never
was
even
in
the
old
times
maybe
i
dreamed
it
if
you
are
quiet
maybe
i
will
allow
us
to
wake
up
in
a
moment
on
the
island
of
adelphi
ann
is
not
changed
muson
reflected
even
though
the
baby
died
mijok
said
i
not
sure
i
think
she
is
in
what
way
i
ca
define
but
she
not
the
same
sad
little
thing
i
watched
when
she
was
sleeping
in
that
fever
well
now
that
was
truly
long
ago
she
puzzled
me
more
than
the
rest
of
you
and
you
were
all
a
great
mystery
and
i
with
a
dozen
words
and
the
old
terrors
crawling
on
my
skin
like
lice
maybe
it
was
her
seeming
weakness
her
secret
look
of
listening
which
i
thought
i
began
to
understand
when
she
taught
me
the
earth
music
but
i
do
suppose
i
ever
did
understand
it
mijok
laughed
and
looked
away
doc
it
was
very
difficult
for
me
to
grasp
that
you
were
not
begotten
out
of
the
west
wind
by
a
thunderbolt
you
never
know
how
difficult
because
you
were
never
a
savage
you
were
born
to
be
articulate
those
twenty
thousand
years
of
blundering
bad
i
doubt
they
were
but
they
gave
you
something
i
am
as
if
the
forest
had
generated
me
with
no
past
miniaan
murmured
and
rolled
over
on
her
back
to
look
up
into
the
leaves
i
too
i
was
never
born
someone
with
no
father
nor
mother
looked
at
that
filthy
mound
they
say
is
the
grave
of
the
queen
of
the
world
the
mind
of
a
charin
is
my
father
and
my
mother
elis
suggested
ann
has
come
neater
to
the
immediate
present
why
elis
pakriaa
was
surprised
she
said
something
like
that
to
me
herself
a
short
while
before
we
came
away
she
said
yesterdays
became
tomorrows
before
i
lived
them
i
want
to
find
today
pakriaa
where
is
today
miniann
pursued
the
dark
stream
of
her
own
thought
which
now
seemed
to
be
giving
her
pleasure
and
not
pain
this
morning
i
found
how
yesterday
can
bury
itself
with
only
the
smallest
scattering
of
years
there
will
be
other
cities
never
again
vestoia
wright
asked
gently
but
you
can
remember
good
and
pleasant
things
of
the
old
city
the
way
it
was
when
you
were
young
there
oh
i
can
i
can
but
i
have
today
too
i
think
i
found
it
first
when
i
bore
my
little
sons
at
adelphi
she
sat
up
leaning
on
pakriaa
shoulder
i
had
good
todays
at
adelphi
i
understand
how
it
could
have
been
abandoned
by
this
spearman
never
seen
in
a
way
paul
said
you
did
see
him
you
were
one
of
those
who
came
on
the
canoes
up
lake
argo
you
saw
the
boat
set
your
fleet
afire
yes
that
was
war
and
before
i
was
wounded
i
killed
i
think
seven
of
your
people
pakriaa
one
with
a
blue
skirt
i
wounded
her
in
the
throat
and
i
have
heard
she
died
in
the
forest
looking
north
yes
tamisraa
my
sister
tamisraa
was
a
bitter
woman
pakriaa
said
and
quite
brave
miniaan
all
that
was
over
long
ago
in
a
forgotten
country
now
we
pull
weeds
in
the
same
garden
night
came
tranquilly
elis
who
kept
the
last
quarter
of
the
watch
waked
them
before
there
was
the
help
of
a
full
red
moon
and
they
followed
the
sound
of
a
swift
river
which
flowed
into
north
lake
through
the
palace
district
of
vestoia
for
more
than
a
mile
outside
the
city
the
jungle
was
like
a
park
undergrowth
removed
vines
cut
away
but
the
vines
were
coming
back
greedy
purple
fingers
curled
to
recapture
and
reclaim
in
the
outskirts
no
one
halted
or
questioned
them
they
saw
no
armed
women
here
and
there
a
man
crouched
in
a
weedy
doorway
with
staring
children
half
hidden
behind
him
mijok
elis
and
arek
walked
on
the
outside
with
shields
upheld
against
a
possible
arrow
or
thrown
spear
rifles
and
pistols
were
now
history
all
ammunition
spent
they
lay
in
a
closet
off
wright
room
at
adelphi
which
he
called
the
terrestrial
museum
paul
wright
and
elis
had
hunting
knives
still
keen
miniaan
leading
them
held
a
spear
but
there
was
a
garland
below
its
blade
symbol
of
peace
pakriaa
and
nisana
preferred
to
carry
no
weapons
muson
and
young
dunin
had
never
handled
one
in
their
lives
miniaan
said
over
her
shoulder
there
is
the
old
stockade
here
we
turn
right
toward
the
palace
there
was
scurrying
and
disturbance
now
beyond
mijok
shield
paul
saw
a
few
lean
women
running
one
of
them
halted
at
miniaan
call
and
approached
uneasily
there
were
questions
dubious
replies
at
the
far
end
of
the
shaded
avenue
was
a
growing
cluster
of
red
bodies
before
a
thatched
building
with
one
tall
doorway
miniaan
explained
i
told
her
that
we
come
peacefully
and
want
to
talk
with
and
she
says
she
thinks
he
would
be
asleep
at
this
hour
so
wright
frowned
and
fretted
but
the
word
you
left
yesterday
would
certainly
have
reached
him
the
vestoian
twittered
a
last
word
or
two
and
ran
away
down
the
street
paul
saw
her
elbowing
through
the
crowd
in
front
of
the
palace
we
might
go
forward
a
little
most
of
the
group
melted
away
some
forty
armed
women
remained
in
a
ragged
formation
blocking
the
entrance
they
made
no
threatening
or
even
warning
gestures
but
their
staring
was
heavy
and
cold
the
volunteer
messenger
returned
pushing
through
them
to
speak
again
with
miniaan
once
or
twice
a
halting
gabble
of
something
like
pidgin
english
made
miniaan
wave
her
hand
impatiently
she
turned
to
paul
it
seems
spearman
told
her
to
say
that
he
is
under
the
the
climate
the
weather
is
this
meaningful
wright
said
tell
him
his
son
is
dead
and
the
doorway
of
his
palace
is
too
narrow
for
our
friends
wait
he
asked
nothing
about
ann
she
does
not
say
so
i
can
send
him
no
message
you
see
what
i
meant
paul
paul
you
send
whatever
word
you
think
best
well
miniaan
ask
her
to
tell
him
that
ann
could
not
come
with
us
that
we
want
to
talk
with
him
and
as
doc
said
that
his
door
is
too
narrow
for
some
of
us
the
soldiers
seemed
to
catch
a
glimmering
of
it
they
made
way
for
the
messenger
and
it
might
be
there
was
less
suspicion
in
them
more
curiosity
tejron
dreamy
eldest
boy
whispered
to
paul
i
am
trying
to
remember
him
not
much
hair
on
his
head
it
was
brown
i
was
only
seven
when
he
flew
us
to
adelphi
his
voice
heavy
yes
his
hair
may
be
gray
now
danny
as
mine
is
his
face
will
look
older
it
never
had
a
young
look
his
body
will
not
have
changed
much
dunin
asked
he
is
older
than
you
no
dear
a
little
younger
but
spearman
seemed
older
by
far
appearing
abruptly
in
the
doorway
arms
spread
against
its
frame
face
thrust
intently
forward
and
eyes
squinting
as
if
they
troubled
him
he
wore
a
black
loincloth
of
bark
fabric
nothing
else
his
sparse
hair
was
wholly
gray
with
streaks
of
white
at
the
temples
his
cheeks
leathery
deeply
grooved
and
flushed
i
did
believe
her
he
said
seeing
him
the
guards
held
their
spears
as
if
they
were
soldiers
presenting
arms
then
grounded
the
butts
they
remained
rigidly
at
attention
when
spearman
paid
them
no
heed
i
did
suppose
spearman
hiccuped
he
rubbed
both
hands
across
his
face
seeing
tormented
uncertainty
in
christopher
wright
paul
stepped
forward
sears
died
long
ago
doc
and
i
got
through
with
some
of
our
friends
he
paused
short
of
the
guards
and
held
out
his
hand
and
spearman
stared
at
it
communing
somehow
with
himself
approaching
at
last
clumsily
to
take
hold
of
it
in
the
old
earth
gesture
there
was
alcohol
on
his
breath
his
bloodshot
eyes
fought
an
open
struggle
with
bewilderment
his
handclasp
was
damp
unsteady
quickly
withdrawn
sorry
he
said
not
well
hard
to
get
it
through
my
head
well
christ
i
a
bit
drunk
not
strange
is
it
mijok
his
glance
traveled
over
pakriaa
and
nisana
without
recognition
it
lingered
at
arek
but
he
did
not
speak
her
name
there
was
the
beginning
of
a
stiff
smile
unreadable
as
his
eyes
fixed
on
christopher
wright
ann
reached
us
wright
said
hardly
audible
she
why
do
you
speak
up
man
she
came
along
the
coast
wright
said
not
much
more
clearly
the
baby
died
a
little
while
before
she
reached
us
spearman
blinked
glanced
at
his
hands
let
them
drop
he
noticed
the
tight
soldiers
in
the
antique
military
manner
of
earth
he
said
at
ease
the
spearwomen
relaxed
part
way
eyes
front
maybe
spearman
said
maybe
you
came
too
soon
what
do
you
mean
paul
asked
we
had
to
come
as
soon
as
we
knew
you
were
alive
are
your
other
children
well
ed
are
they
here
oh
yes
i
see
you
came
too
soon
i
still
have
a
little
town
of
seven
or
eight
thousand
and
some
very
loyal
followers
wright
struck
his
fist
into
his
palm
we
are
not
your
enemies
we
never
were
there
was
a
place
for
you
at
adelphi
there
is
now
oh
i
can
imagine
it
so
ann
ann
came
back
to
us
it
took
her
a
hundred
days
she
says
she
was
is
skin
and
bone
paul
said
she
recover
ed
only
needs
rest
and
food
she
wants
john
and
david
naturally
they
her
children
too
ed
spearman
said
almost
absently
are
they
what
i
do
exactly
believe
your
story
you
know
you
must
have
been
watching
for
a
long
time
behind
him
paul
heard
nisana
miserable
whisper
what
is
it
what
is
it
and
wright
muffled
answer
a
sickness
there
no
truth
in
that
ed
paul
said
five
days
ago
we
still
supposed
that
you
and
ann
were
lost
when
the
lifeboat
went
down
in
the
channel
spearman
shrugged
yes
i
think
you
come
too
soon
you
should
have
worked
longer
in
the
dark
we
had
an
epidemic
here
many
died
and
another
trouble
mental
well
you
kept
track
of
that
of
course
the
way
they
fallen
away
from
me
gone
back
to
the
forest
and
the
old
life
when
i
could
have
given
them
a
golden
age
a
prophet
without
honor
he
coughed
and
straightened
heavy
shoulders
my
god
i
ca
blame
the
poor
fools
now
that
i
know
how
it
was
done
his
voice
did
not
rise
without
the
conspiracy
and
interference
i
could
soon
have
started
them
in
building
a
ship
that
never
mind
that
now
i
have
the
designs
of
course
that
what
you
came
for
mijok
broke
in
utterly
bewildered
what
are
you
saying
spearman
dismissed
the
giant
with
a
stare
and
a
voice
of
cold
politeness
i
do
blame
you
either
i
remember
you
well
i
suppose
you
had
to
do
whatever
your
god
ordered
without
question
the
twin
boys
had
appeared
in
the
doorway
dressed
like
their
father
in
bark
fabric
slim
children
like
ann
nine
earth
years
old
they
halted
uncertainly
perhaps
driven
by
curiosity
to
violate
an
order
of
their
father
paul
tried
to
smile
at
them
and
one
responded
but
then
blushed
and
looked
worriedly
away
with
a
hand
over
his
mouth
the
other
stared
like
a
pygmy
without
expression
spearman
did
not
appear
to
notice
them
though
paul
smile
must
have
told
him
of
their
presence
elis
broke
the
silence
mijok
and
the
others
of
my
people
do
not
create
gods
we
live
by
our
own
light
so
far
as
it
reaches
without
fear
of
the
mysteries
beyond
it
his
voice
so
seldom
loud
in
anything
but
laughter
boomed
and
echoed
back
from
the
thatched
walls
at
adelphi
orders
derive
from
the
laws
which
are
made
by
all
of
us
and
understood
by
all
of
us
yes
spearman
nodded
upper
lip
drawn
in
as
one
who
saw
his
saddest
predictions
verified
yes
he
would
teach
you
to
say
that
arek
said
disgustedly
there
no
conversation
here
he
listens
to
his
own
mind
no
other
as
it
was
on
the
beach
years
ago
i
remember
spearman
said
sharply
wright
be
careful
you
brought
your
bullies
here
but
i
ought
to
warn
you
this
is
the
country
where
i
still
rule
there
are
some
left
who
love
me
and
understand
me
dunin
muttered
to
paul
bullies
what
word
is
that
paul
squeezed
her
wrist
a
warning
to
be
silent
speaking
with
care
and
difficulty
wright
said
ed
your
boys
are
about
nine
earth
time
would
you
say
that
is
old
enough
to
make
certain
decisions
would
you
be
willing
ed
to
ask
them
whether
they
want
to
go
to
adelphi
and
see
their
mother
again
spearman
glanced
back
at
them
he
would
be
seeing
paul
knew
how
the
boy
who
had
smiled
was
staring
at
wright
with
his
mouth
fallen
open
how
the
other
blank
look
had
crumpled
into
a
grimace
foretelling
tears
now
i
really
understand
it
spearman
said
softly
so
it
was
a
kidnaping
a
real
kidnaping
i
simply
would
not
believe
it
when
my
messengers
came
from
spearman
city
but
i
should
have
known
i
should
have
known
you
stole
ann
in
order
to
get
my
children
too
for
your
there
was
a
murmuring
among
the
guard
and
in
the
crowd
of
pygmy
spectators
who
had
gathered
at
a
safe
distance
uncomprehendingly
paul
saw
a
few
wildly
pointing
arms
saw
one
of
the
guards
throw
away
her
spear
and
run
blindly
down
the
street
others
were
doing
the
same
the
swelling
murmur
was
broken
by
thin
screams
those
of
the
guard
who
remained
were
staring
into
the
northeast
quarter
of
the
sky
where
a
break
in
the
trees
permitted
a
view
of
it
and
they
were
transfixed
the
guard
and
spearman
boys
and
now
spearman
himself
glaring
at
that
blue
patch
of
morning
heaven
with
total
unbelief
but
then
spearman
did
believe
it
was
perhaps
the
first
to
believe
it
tears
starting
from
his
gray
eyes
and
running
unregarded
down
the
hard
channels
of
his
face
from
home
home
oh
my
god
so
long
a
time
the
spot
seemed
small
and
slow
in
its
descent
riding
on
a
cushion
of
flame
brighter
than
sunlight
the
vestoian
pygmies
were
all
running
now
not
into
their
houses
nor
the
palace
but
away
down
the
streets
a
mindless
stampede
weapons
tossed
away
with
an
agonized
crying
of
tiny
voices
paul
eyes
found
it
held
it
saw
the
white
flame
change
to
a
vast
outpouring
of
brilliant
green
like
the
burning
of
copper
charlesite
spearman
cried
they
found
how
to
use
charlesite
for
braking
no
radioactivity
the
ship
must
be
aiming
for
the
open
ground
twenty
miles
away
they
could
hear
the
roaring
now
almost
gentle
with
distance
arek
red
arm
became
a
warmth
over
paul
shoulders
she
said
afraid
the
gap
in
the
leaves
was
blank
the
green
flame
gone
edmund
spearman
gazed
at
the
spot
where
the
descending
ship
had
been
unaware
of
his
sons
unaware
that
his
pygmy
followers
had
been
scattered
by
fear
as
swallows
are
scattered
by
a
storm
unaware
paul
guessed
of
the
two
men
who
had
been
friends
and
now
were
strangers
but
these
he
presently
saw
again
his
gray
eyes
measured
paul
and
wright
the
unspeaking
giants
the
small
shaken
figures
of
pakriaa
and
nisana
and
miniaan
as
if
they
were
rocks
or
tree
stumps
and
his
only
problem
how
to
step
around
them
addressing
wright
and
arek
whose
big
arm
was
still
warm
around
his
shoulders
paul
said
carefully
it
will
come
down
on
the
meadow
ground
about
twenty
miles
from
here
they
must
have
seen
vestoia
from
the
air
they
probably
made
sure
there
was
no
settlement
in
the
open
land
wright
whispered
it
may
not
even
have
been
from
earth
oh
mijok
black
lips
smiled
it
is
doc
i
forget
our
eyes
are
better
at
distance
you
did
see
the
letters
black
on
silver
reaching
halfway
up
the
body
of
the
ship
so
in
wright
face
was
a
sudden
blaze
of
belief
spearman
stared
he
said
quite
an
imagination
glad
it
was
you
who
made
it
up
and
not
one
of
the
men
who
knew
the
real
jensen
a
name
that
ought
not
to
be
taken
in
vain
i
have
good
eyes
said
mijok
gently
i
made
up
nothing
spearman
eyebrows
lifted
a
fury
of
mimic
politeness
he
stepped
around
the
group
as
if
they
were
not
rocks
but
dangerous
animals
he
passed
down
the
street
in
long
strides
not
looking
back
even
for
his
sons
paul
stupidly
watched
him
go
saw
him
reach
the
turning
by
the
stockade
and
break
into
a
loping
run
stout
muson
muttered
so
changed
what
sickness
could
make
such
a
change
wright
said
it
is
not
likely
to
pass
in
the
old
days
of
earth
they
sometimes
ruled
nations
or
they
were
put
away
in
institutions
usually
after
others
had
been
injured
or
they
were
fanatics
of
one
sort
and
another
ridden
by
the
devil
of
one
idea
my
profession
learned
a
little
about
them
never
enough
the
law
met
them
more
often
and
learned
less
he
watched
paul
perhaps
needing
contact
with
a
charin
mind
since
the
innocence
of
the
others
gave
them
no
frame
of
reference
i
dare
say
ed
is
paranoid
only
on
the
one
point
technically
all
his
troubles
are
caused
by
me
and
my
what
did
he
say
conspiracy
a
means
to
help
him
believe
that
only
he
is
right
and
virtuous
and
the
universe
wrong
it
is
not
so
much
a
sickness
muson
as
the
sum
of
years
of
mental
bad
habits
vanity
and
dislike
of
one
own
kind
make
most
of
the
seed
and
this
is
the
fruit
elis
said
we
can
overtake
him
six
of
us
giants
we
can
carry
you
overtake
him
in
a
walk
if
you
think
best
yes
wright
watched
the
empty
street
and
spearman
palace
that
already
seemed
haunted
and
forlorn
i
believe
there
no
need
for
haste
twenty
miles
the
vestoian
pygmies
were
not
returning
the
street
was
a
desolation
of
rubbish
and
loneliness
with
the
dull
smell
of
neglect
one
of
spearman
boys
was
whimpering
the
other
watched
the
place
where
his
father
had
disappeared
a
tension
in
his
small
face
without
forgiveness
wright
said
who
john
and
who
david
the
crying
one
muttered
i
john
david
spoke
as
if
the
words
had
been
shaken
out
he
said
she
ever
come
back
where
is
she
at
our
island
paul
told
him
she
all
right
david
and
going
to
take
you
to
her
you
want
that
do
you
is
going
there
we
do
know
david
you
want
to
go
with
us
do
you
he
hit
her
face
when
she
said
it
was
his
fault
that
they
were
all
giving
up
the
city
he
always
had
the
guards
six
sat
around
his
bed
every
night
john
and
me
we
tried
we
made
a
grass
picture
like
the
priest
kona
told
us
to
do
and
did
things
with
it
and
burned
it
it
was
no
good
arek
said
let
forget
that
for
now
we
going
to
the
new
ship
and
then
the
island
shall
i
carry
you
i
got
two
boys
your
age
who
you
i
never
saw
anybody
like
you
she
dropped
on
one
knee
not
too
close
to
him
i
like
you
david
just
big
and
furry
that
all
your
mother
david
said
wright
and
swallowed
your
mother
is
living
in
my
house
now
she
was
our
friend
long
before
you
were
born
you
know
she
came
from
earth
with
us
you
with
us
are
you
the
boy
scuffed
his
bare
feet
in
the
dust
john
was
still
crying
david
slapped
him
savagely
you
stop
yakking
of
a
bitch
the
words
could
have
no
meaning
for
him
paul
thought
beyond
the
generalized
stink
of
profanity
john
stopped
and
rubbed
his
cheek
without
apparent
anger
gulping
and
then
nodding
when
arek
reached
david
let
her
pick
him
up
and
he
relaxed
and
buried
his
face
in
her
fur
the
giants
made
little
of
the
miles
mijok
had
pakriaa
and
nisana
in
his
arms
and
miniaan
perched
on
his
shoulder
they
had
traveled
often
that
way
on
the
troublesome
journey
to
vestoia
elis
carried
trifling
pounds
and
muson
had
john
her
slow
voice
establishing
cautious
friendship
paul
preferred
to
walk
on
his
own
feet
but
before
long
stole
up
behind
and
swept
him
into
a
living
cradle
slow
legs
do
mind
do
you
pop
pop
huh
no
i
do
mind
danny
i
was
getting
cramps
and
too
dumb
to
admit
it
dunin
chuckled
that
danny
knows
all
sees
all
says
live
with
him
awhile
when
he
grows
up
if
only
he
was
so
lazy
what
wrong
with
being
lazy
not
a
thing
rockhead
only
if
you
going
to
explore
the
way
i
am
you
ca
be
lazy
the
way
you
are
she
twisted
a
branch
into
a
leaf
crown
and
walked
backward
before
them
trying
the
crown
on
the
head
at
different
angles
ah
wonderful
charging
asonis
whuff
whuff
and
now
you
look
just
like
the
kink
that
chewed
up
my
diary
to
make
a
nest
which
was
your
fault
for
leaving
it
on
a
shelf
and
not
writing
in
it
explorers
have
to
keep
diaries
doc
said
so
did
he
paul
i
strictly
neutral
to
avoid
bouncing
so
anyway
dunin
when
you
trip
over
a
root
and
smack
your
fanny
going
to
laugh
she
did
he
did
it
was
an
hour
before
they
overtook
spearman
who
glanced
back
without
expression
without
halting
his
powerful
strides
his
tanned
body
gleaming
with
sweat
and
effort
dunin
sobered
she
caught
paul
eyes
she
said
may
i
carry
you
spearman
then
we
can
all
reach
the
ship
at
the
same
time
spearman
gave
no
sign
of
hearing
her
he
drew
up
at
the
side
of
the
trail
staring
at
the
ground
arms
folded
david
face
was
hidden
again
at
arek
breast
john
seemed
to
be
asleep
dunin
said
please
why
should
we
leave
you
behind
remote
and
desolate
spearman
watched
the
ground
dunin
moved
on
reluctantly
no
more
laughter
in
her
what
he
thinking
wright
said
at
this
moment
he
probably
thinking
it
brutally
unfair
that
we
should
go
on
ahead
of
him
but
i
asked
you
did
what
more
he
has
anything
against
you
all
the
same
that
about
what
he
be
thinking
do
try
too
hard
to
understand
it
dunin
i
not
sure
it
worth
it
let
think
about
the
ship
paul
is
it
possible
what
he
said
about
charlesite
i
reckon
so
doc
the
flame
certainly
did
change
to
green
i
think
i
remember
long
ago
hearing
some
engineers
discuss
the
possibility
of
stepping
up
charlesite
enough
so
it
could
be
used
in
braking
a
big
ship
for
descent
instead
of
keeping
the
atomics
on
all
the
way
down
it
would
char
everything
over
a
wide
area
but
at
least
it
make
radioactive
desert
i
ca
feel
it
wright
mumbled
mirage
it
was
no
mirage
the
ship
stood
high
above
blackened
ground
half
a
mile
away
even
here
at
the
edge
of
forest
there
was
a
lingering
smell
anciently
familiar
paul
felt
himself
grinning
stupidly
plain
carbon
tet
or
something
like
it
must
have
shot
it
out
to
kill
any
grass
fires
no
mirage
towering
above
a
tripod
it
flaunted
the
letters
of
a
great
name
and
david
spearman
rubbed
his
eyes
at
it
leaning
against
arek
knee
accepting
the
protective
touch
of
her
hand
arek
said
what
oh
paul
what
will
they
be
like
wright
shook
his
head
plainly
feeling
it
now
the
thought
the
memories
the
pleasure
and
something
far
from
pleasure
paul
answered
they
will
look
like
us
arek
pakriaa
pointed
up
there
that
we
remember
oh
the
beautiful
a
boat
out
already
paul
searched
and
found
the
silver
flight
wright
chattered
have
we
anything
anything
white
no
you
and
i
out
in
the
open
paul
rest
of
you
keep
back
they
need
to
recognize
what
we
are
he
was
shaking
and
paul
embraced
his
shoulders
to
steady
him
as
they
moved
into
the
open
ground
wright
giggled
hysterically
damn
white
flag
myself
my
whiskers
the
boat
swooped
swelling
from
a
dot
to
keen
familiar
lines
it
circled
above
them
twice
and
came
to
earth
in
a
perfect
landing
a
hundred
feet
away
a
blank
pallor
in
the
pilot
window
would
be
a
human
face
there
would
be
a
human
brain
shocked
into
new
wonder
it
was
still
necessary
for
paul
to
help
his
teacher
through
the
grass
for
wright
was
swaying
and
stumbling
paul
reminded
him
they
be
sealed
up
afraid
of
the
air
ah
yes
i
say
they
need
be
we
have
good
air
on
lucifer
paul
was
aware
of
his
own
struggle
for
sanity
for
clarity
in
the
beginning
of
this
impossible
joy
which
was
not
pure
joy
he
heard
himself
shout
at
the
top
of
his
strong
lungs
the
no
they
wo
hear
it
yes
they
did
they
did
the
door
slid
open
for
a
meeting
of
two
worlds
a
square
little
bald
man
a
tall
woman
who
fussed
at
her
ears
troubled
by
the
change
in
atmospheric
pressure
faded
overalls
the
human
look
incredulous
stares
changing
to
belief
the
bald
man
gulped
and
stumbled
he
grinned
and
held
out
his
hand
christopher
wright
i
presume
wright
could
neither
speak
nor
let
go
the
hand
the
woman
said
you
must
be
well
who
could
forget
the
photographs
you
paul
mason
yes
we
never
for
years
we
have
even
thought
mark
slade
said
the
bald
man
captain
slade
this
is
nora
stern
sir
i
you
are
well
you
look
well
we
are
well
said
wright
i
afraid
to
ask
the
others
oliphant
captain
jensen
the
the
little
girls
and
there
was
a
young
engineer
edmund
spearman
paul
managed
to
say
both
little
girls
are
mothers
oliphant
and
captain
jensen
died
jensen
on
the
ship
in
the
last
acceleration
spearman
is
will
be
here
before
long
i
think
you
may
find
him
somewhat
changed
wright
said
we
must
let
ed
speak
for
himself
paul
in
spite
of
the
shock
the
newness
stern
was
sensitive
to
nuances
she
said
too
loudly
beautiful
country
she
pressed
both
hands
to
her
ears
and
took
them
away
and
spoke
in
a
normal
voice
there
oh
what
strange
steep
hills
like
any
rock
of
earth
paul
stammered
defies
erosion
i
am
speaking
with
the
pride
of
a
home
lover
the
open
ground
is
a
little
dangerous
flying
carnivores
come
and
meet
our
friends
captain
slade
had
already
seen
the
giants
and
pygmies
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
his
small
monkey
face
was
ablaze
with
friendly
curiosity
and
the
startled
amusement
that
will
wake
at
anything
new
but
he
said
in
just
a
moment
let
me
take
this
in
if
i
can
we
done
it
nora
he
filled
his
lungs
deeply
blinking
at
a
few
tears
of
pleasure
a
world
like
ours
a
new
world
oh
nora
it
be
a
long
time
before
we
can
believe
this
you
and
i
high
oxygen
we
noticed
feels
like
it
sir
your
ship
lost
said
wright
tranquilly
now
no
longer
shaking
from
head
to
foot
out
of
control
in
descent
fell
in
a
lake
he
motioned
over
his
shoulder
a
few
miles
over
there
we
call
it
lake
argo
too
deep
even
to
think
of
salvage
one
of
the
lifeboats
cracked
up
we
used
the
other
for
about
a
year
our
friends
captain
you
like
our
friends
slade
murmured
speculation
on
parallel
evolution
seems
to
have
been
sound
here
anyway
humanoid
i
see
two
species
human
said
wright
their
english
by
the
way
is
better
than
mine
they
are
close
to
us
captain
very
dear
to
us
i
see
said
captain
slade
kindly
paul
thought
ca
see
too
new
but
maybe
he
will
try
to
how
many
in
your
party
captain
slade
grinned
only
four
mr
mason
mister
that
a
smaller
crew
bigger
ship
federation
thought
best
we
left
thirteen
years
after
you
twelve
years
on
the
journey
of
course
had
to
double
in
brass
considerably
the
other
two
are
a
young
couple
jimmy
mukerji
he
from
calcutta
oh
and
by
the
way
wright
his
mother
was
sigrid
hoch
anthropologist
one
of
your
students
sigrid
wright
groped
in
the
past
of
course
i
remember
but
paul
guessed
that
he
did
not
jimmy
a
botanist
engineer
oh
general
technician
good
anywhere
sally
marino
another
good
technician
frankly
i
did
want
specialists
wanted
kids
who
could
turn
a
hand
to
anything
and
i
got
slade
friendly
face
saddened
he
and
stern
were
walking
clumsily
to
the
woods
feeling
the
change
in
gravity
ours
was
to
be
the
last
interstellar
ship
wright
until
either
you
or
we
came
home
there
be
no
building
going
on
now
a
federation
decision
matter
of
public
opinion
as
well
as
economics
well
the
old
lady
over
there
did
cost
twice
as
much
as
your
upped
the
federation
poll
tax
three
per
cent
just
to
pay
for
her
on
paper
could
have
got
around
that
maybe
but
there
was
a
beginning
of
public
hysteria
protest
resentment
at
the
idea
of
throwing
lives
and
billions
into
space
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
for
many
years
fanatics
on
both
sides
and
both
noisy
plus
the
war
scare
of
course
thinking
human
you
ca
blame
them
said
nora
stern
i
do
blame
them
nora
now
that
we
know
it
can
be
done
elis
had
tried
to
be
ready
with
a
little
speech
of
welcome
but
shyness
made
him
stiff
with
dignity
and
it
was
evident
that
dunin
would
break
loose
in
nervous
giggling
elis
said
only
you
very
welcome
we
hope
you
enjoy
it
here
pakriaa
might
have
been
back
in
the
days
of
tribal
grandeur
but
her
control
too
was
only
a
result
of
shyness
and
wonder
as
she
echoed
the
governor
words
it
was
unfairly
difficult
for
the
newcomers
paul
could
see
the
furry
nakedness
and
majesty
the
pygmies
tininess
and
wrinkled
baldness
even
the
beauty
of
miniaan
features
might
be
invisible
to
new
charin
eyes
but
slade
and
stern
behaved
well
with
a
natural
friendliness
why
said
slade
these
boys
john
and
david
spearman
paul
explained
ann
boys
spearman
we
think
he
be
here
shortly
arek
asked
evenly
you
come
to
stay
i
hope
to
stay
slade
shot
a
startled
glance
at
wright
who
avoided
it
giving
him
no
help
paul
said
quickly
captain
we
ought
to
have
warned
you
but
neither
doc
nor
i
could
get
our
wits
together
until
you
opened
the
door
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
hours
from
now
you
have
a
fever
and
a
period
of
unconsciousness
not
too
much
discomfort
and
so
far
as
we
know
no
danger
anyhow
all
of
us
recovered
in
fine
shape
and
had
excellent
health
ever
since
we
decided
it
just
a
part
of
acclimation
to
we
call
this
planet
lucifer
but
if
you
think
the
two
others
should
stay
in
the
ship
till
you
recover
stern
was
measuring
him
shrewdly
you
look
very
healthy
both
of
you
and
i
know
we
can
take
your
word
for
anything
jimmy
and
sally
are
pretty
rugged
they
be
wild
to
join
us
sally
will
be
at
the
intercom
right
now
tearing
her
pretty
hair
out
in
handfuls
they
might
as
well
chance
it
with
us
where
do
you
people
live
we
saw
a
settlement
over
there
south
of
the
lake
wright
glanced
at
paul
with
vague
entreaty
it
was
miniaan
who
spoke
the
small
silver
of
her
voice
a
music
in
the
shadow
the
settlement
below
the
lake
is
a
thing
of
the
past
an
empire
that
died
we
live
on
a
warm
island
over
yonder
the
other
side
of
those
mountains
the
island
adelphi
we
are
returning
there
now
after
a
journey
with
some
trouble
in
it
adelphi
said
stern
savoring
the
name
mark
our
two
boats
could
fly
them
all
there
with
us
could
they
take
out
the
emergency
stuff
to
make
room
it
would
be
wise
said
paul
we
could
take
better
care
of
you
during
the
illness
at
adelphi
we
have
houses
there
here
it
not
very
safe
biting
flies
and
some
dangerous
animals
slade
was
doubtful
anything
here
that
could
interfere
with
the
ship
if
we
leave
it
unguarded
miniaan
laughed
certainly
the
people
of
vestoia
will
not
go
near
it
nothing
could
harm
it
said
wright
too
big
how
in
hell
do
you
get
down
out
of
it
slade
chuckled
and
made
up
his
mind
electronic
lock
can
work
it
from
a
transmitter
in
the
lifeboat
only
other
way
from
inside
lets
down
a
ladder
automatic
derricks
in
the
side
blisters
to
hoist
the
lifeboats
if
as
and
when
they
thought
of
everything
he
hugged
the
woman
even
briefing
on
how
to
get
along
with
each
other
for
years
learning
love
can
be
difficult
said
pakriaa
stern
stared
at
the
tiny
woman
with
new
intentness
pakriaa
seamed
face
had
taken
on
its
dreamy
look
you
must
see
our
island
last
year
mashana
dorothy
was
governor
of
our
island
this
year
it
is
this
man
she
touched
elis
knee
a
sinecure
elis
chuckled
a
sinecure
gentlemen
captain
slade
laughed
standing
five
feet
five
peering
up
at
the
governor
eight
feet
seven
half
a
head
more
than
mijok
height
paul
thought
he
saw
there
the
raw
materials
of
friendship
stern
said
and
you
call
this
planet
lucifer
said
nisana
there
was
grief
in
her
face
not
evident
in
any
of
the
others
son
of
the
morning
paul
moved
toward
her
wondering
slade
had
missed
the
overtone
and
cocked
a
dark
eyebrow
industries
wright
shrugged
a
few
sir
all
we
seem
to
need
at
present
in
such
a
small
community
oh
slade
touched
the
old
man
jacket
this
is
fine
fabric
i
could
tell
it
from
linen
is
it
very
similar
wright
took
nisana
hand
on
his
palm
this
lady
is
our
best
weaver
because
her
hands
are
so
small
and
sure
our
loom
is
clumsy
because
of
course
our
metalworking
is
not
far
advanced
but
it
does
good
work
for
nisana
i
like
to
weave
nisana
whispered
looking
here
and
there
and
not
at
paul
i
like
to
make
new
things
paul
glimpsed
the
twitch
of
mijok
ears
the
beckoning
curve
of
a
gray
finger
mijok
whispered
he
coming
paul
a
few
hundred
yards
away
in
the
woods
breathing
hard
and
limping
is
there
nothing
we
can
do
for
him
i
do
know
mijok
i
afraid
whatever
is
done
he
must
do
for
himself
and
it
late
for
that
very
late
he
saw
that
mijok
was
trying
to
understand
and
could
not
his
mind
is
living
in
another
country
but
outwardly
at
least
edmund
spearman
was
changed
he
even
searched
out
dunin
worried
face
and
apologized
should
have
accepted
your
offer
stupid
of
me
he
smiled
wanted
to
show
what
a
walker
i
was
i
guess
john
and
david
slipped
behind
muson
back
tense
and
cold
spearman
shook
slade
hand
and
stern
my
god
it
does
seem
possible
i
ca
take
it
in
slade
you
said
and
stern
wondered
dreamed
prayed
for
it
i
ca
tell
you
i
do
know
what
to
say
good
trip
excellent
slade
hugged
himself
excellent
beyond
description
ah
all
the
federation
needed
was
proof
they
got
it
now
rather
they
will
have
it
in
twelve
years
lordy
i
be
he
pounded
paul
on
the
back
and
spearman
giving
way
to
a
bubbling
overflow
of
good
nature
there
be
a
new
president
whole
new
council
i
guess
and
they
wo
be
looking
for
us
either
man
he
danced
a
few
steps
and
jabbed
paul
in
the
ribs
think
of
it
why
it
a
tom
sawyer
job
you
know
you
remember
when
you
and
i
walk
up
the
middle
aisle
in
the
federation
hall
oh
man
man
paul
had
to
find
nisana
face
again
and
the
devastation
of
sorrow
in
it
before
he
understood
he
stooped
quickly
to
whisper
i
am
not
going
back
to
earth
the
radiance
in
the
aging
red
face
was
like
a
charin
girl
and
he
heard
stern
remark
dryly
mark
i
believe
we
got
some
nearer
bridges
to
cross
one
of
the
soft
lamps
gleamed
in
kajana
room
though
it
was
late
and
the
house
was
hushed
paul
had
not
been
able
to
find
sleep
dorothy
would
be
watching
at
the
bedsides
of
the
four
unconscious
newcomers
from
earth
for
another
hour
until
tejron
relieved
her
paul
tapped
at
kajana
doorway
may
i
come
in
yes
please
do
the
little
man
smiled
up
from
his
pillows
they
were
filled
with
a
stuff
like
dandelion
down
almost
as
good
as
feathers
will
you
lift
me
a
little
paul
fussed
over
him
glad
of
something
to
do
i
was
not
sleepy
i
finished
transcribing
from
the
shorthand
but
my
thought
remains
with
it
shorthand
the
talk
of
this
afternoon
you
did
know
i
was
recording
it
you
were
all
speaking
somewhat
beyond
yourselves
in
a
way
i
wanted
to
preserve
i
wish
we
had
better
pencils
these
last
are
not
bad
blue
clay
mixed
with
the
graphite
but
they
still
crumble
too
easily
and
the
wood
is
big
for
my
hand
i
used
the
brown
ink
for
the
transcription
he
shuffled
the
gray
pages
together
you
might
like
to
look
at
it
yes
tonight
i
think
doc
did
say
some
things
worth
remembering
kajana
smiled
so
did
you
did
i
pencils
are
one
thing
they
must
have
had
on
the
ship
in
abundance
the
library
too
poor
doc
he
have
given
anything
for
the
books
so
would
i
kajana
patted
his
hand
maybe
it
does
matter
too
much
paul
we
have
our
own
books
to
make
besides
do
you
think
spearman
may
have
unloaded
some
things
for
us
before
he
took
off
not
a
chance
his
mind
would
work
that
way
no
well
you
knew
him
better
still
he
had
time
paul
he
knew
we
could
go
after
him
you
told
me
he
drained
the
fuel
out
of
one
lifeboat
before
he
stole
the
other
and
it
was
three
hours
after
you
found
he
was
gone
before
you
saw
the
big
ship
go
up
over
the
range
and
down
paul
said
still
physically
shaken
with
the
memory
the
sound
the
sight
of
it
down
into
the
sea
forever
what
happened
do
you
think
we
never
know
it
was
a
new
type
of
ship
his
knowledge
of
such
things
was
ten
years
old
lucifer
years
likely
the
was
too
complex
for
one
man
to
handle
it
after
we
saw
it
climb
past
the
range
we
stayed
there
doc
and
dorothy
and
miniaan
and
i
near
the
temple
just
stayed
there
and
wondering
we
saw
it
reappear
a
dot
then
a
flame
he
never
quit
trying
he
had
the
atomics
blazing
all
the
way
down
sometimes
they
lift
the
ship
a
little
and
we
i
suppose
we
were
breathing
we
think
yes
no
yes
no
i
even
thought
is
he
going
to
crash
it
but
he
was
really
many
miles
to
the
west
only
seemed
near
so
bright
in
that
darkness
a
meteor
yes
call
him
a
meteor
burned
out
and
lost
up
to
the
very
end
until
we
saw
it
strike
the
water
near
the
western
horizon
he
was
still
trying
a
mad
insect
heaving
against
the
web
of
gravity
and
we
never
know
what
he
really
wanted
either
i
have
an
idea
he
may
not
have
meant
to
go
back
to
earth
i
think
perhaps
he
wanted
another
star
one
that
never
was
and
paul
wondered
i
tell
kajana
what
doc
said
when
it
was
all
over
no
not
now
not
till
i
understand
it
i
consider
myself
to
blame
what
do
you
mean
remember
when
arek
noticed
he
was
gone
i
saw
him
slip
away
ten
minutes
before
she
spoke
he
looked
at
me
too
i
think
i
may
have
known
what
he
meant
to
do
i
said
nothing
earth
is
a
very
distant
place
paul
the
federation
is
building
no
more
interstellar
ships
for
a
while
for
a
while
but
you
i
may
therefore
be
to
blame
i
look
within
and
am
confused
as
so
often
but
all
the
same
here
in
our
world
i
have
helped
to
establish
a
few
practical
certainties
during
that
murmured
interchange
by
the
temple
dorothy
had
been
quite
silent
as
if
she
needed
no
question
and
answer
and
miniaan
had
ended
it
saying
let
go
back
and
tell
the
others
that
something
has
ended
kajana
old
mind
was
roving
after
other
matters
to
him
more
important
than
spearman
or
the
beautiful
lost
ship
from
earth
teddy
he
said
do
you
know
paul
when
the
two
silver
boats
came
slipping
down
out
of
the
sky
teddy
only
glanced
at
them
once
and
came
running
to
carry
me
outdoors
so
that
i
could
see
them
too
it
was
her
first
thought
her
father
and
mother
in
her
and
what
a
new
self
too
kajana
was
having
pain
from
the
old
injury
that
would
never
heal
that
transcription
paul
it
quite
verbatim
even
to
a
little
hemming
and
hawing
good
paul
studied
the
wizened
red
face
regretful
that
his
painter
power
could
never
record
what
was
really
kajana
too
much
that
must
escape
even
if
the
portrait
were
faithful
to
the
small
patient
hands
the
groove
in
the
left
fingers
caused
by
years
of
effort
with
makeshift
writing
materials
sears
and
paul
could
think
it
now
without
too
much
distress
sears
could
have
understood
kajana
better
can
i
get
you
anything
no
thank
you
paul
i
very
well
tonight
but
some
other
thought
stirred
in
him
and
paul
lingered
knowing
what
it
was
a
need
for
a
particular
reassurance
kajana
only
outward
concession
to
his
frailty
paul
what
do
you
really
think
when
the
time
comes
will
it
be
something
like
a
sleep
i
believe
so
kajana
but
not
soon
we
need
you
the
mild
face
showed
gratitude
then
calm
it
glanced
beyond
him
why
abara
you
should
be
snoring
abara
followed
his
comfortable
potbelly
into
the
room
his
fluty
voice
was
indignant
i
never
snore
he
sank
by
the
bed
rocking
lightly
with
a
foot
in
each
hand
i
heard
you
old
man
said
abara
hear
yourself
snoring
of
course
paul
stretched
you
gentlemen
settle
down
to
a
good
soothing
quarrel
i
take
off
abara
left
eyelid
lowered
and
lifted
gravely
good
night
good
night
said
the
little
voices
leaving
the
room
paul
heard
abara
murmur
do
you
remember
paul
carried
a
taper
from
the
permanent
fire
in
the
common
room
to
relight
the
lamp
in
his
and
dorothy
bedroom
it
was
late
indeed
near
to
the
time
of
the
rising
of
the
red
moon
seen
only
the
night
before
from
the
jungle
west
of
vestoia
what
had
been
vestoia
here
in
the
long
room
there
was
still
a
friendly
disorder
from
the
impromptu
banquet
of
the
evening
because
of
the
disturbance
when
flight
was
discovered
and
preoccupation
with
the
illness
of
the
newcomers
the
common
room
had
received
only
a
few
housekeeping
flurries
mats
were
still
scattered
in
the
center
of
the
floor
earthen
wine
cups
stood
about
carrying
the
taper
paul
saw
by
his
foot
a
graded
series
of
round
faces
drawn
on
the
earth
with
a
twig
helen
was
apt
to
do
that
when
most
of
her
mind
was
elsewhere
the
faces
were
made
of
neat
circles
even
nose
and
mouth
subject
to
a
pinch
on
the
bottom
from
her
helen
called
them
teddies
paul
smiled
sleepily
and
stepped
around
kajana
took
pride
in
the
sharp
printlike
quality
of
his
writing
under
lamplight
the
brown
ink
shifted
into
gold
kajana
had
not
recorded
the
casual
beginning
of
the
banquet
the
idea
had
evidently
come
to
him
after
some
remark
of
kamon
paul
could
not
remember
it
clearly
but
the
old
giantess
had
been
roused
to
it
by
a
thing
the
rather
girl
sally
marino
had
mentioned
the
prospect
of
war
on
the
planet
earth
kajana
had
taken
down
what
followed
as
direct
dialogue
riffling
through
the
gray
pages
paul
noticed
that
kajana
had
inserted
no
comment
of
his
own
at
all
the
phonetic
shorthand
paul
knew
was
kajana
invention
ideal
for
his
own
use
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
teach
it
even
to
nisana
too
intricate
she
said
needing
the
hyperacute
ear
which
was
a
gift
kajana
could
not
share
slade
there
seems
never
to
be
a
single
cause
of
war
only
a
group
of
causes
coming
to
a
particular
focus
in
time
our
world
madam
wright
just
kamon
somehow
we
never
formed
the
habit
of
courtesy
titles
captain
names
nicknames
and
a
few
titles
of
function
as
for
instance
if
elis
were
conducting
one
of
our
meetings
we
address
him
as
governor
slade
oh
pleasant
i
should
think
our
world
kamon
is
still
divided
in
two
parts
an
ideological
division
there
is
the
asian
empire
of
jenga
let
me
show
you
the
map
dunin
here
i
grabbed
it
and
what
a
map
if
only
we
could
make
such
things
dorothy
in
time
sugar
takes
mighty
complex
machinery
to
make
such
a
map
slade
one
of
the
things
that
must
come
on
the
next
trip
from
earth
well
here
is
the
asian
empire
you
can
see
the
vastness
of
it
one
land
mass
almost
all
of
a
continent
mukerji
except
my
country
nora
stern
well
naturally
jimmy
mukerji
i
tend
to
be
sensitive
on
the
point
since
we
joined
the
federation
somewhat
belatedly
slade
that
the
asian
empire
and
there
they
believe
and
have
long
believed
that
individual
man
is
nothing
an
ant
in
a
colony
the
state
is
everything
a
sole
reason
for
existence
the
state
wright
which
exists
only
in
the
minds
of
individual
men
slade
for
them
the
state
takes
the
place
of
god
of
reason
of
ethics
of
oh
it
and
so
far
as
an
individualist
like
myself
can
understand
their
doctrine
a
hundred
years
ago
this
empire
was
two
great
states
they
had
the
same
doctrine
then
but
called
it
by
a
less
honest
name
communism
derived
from
certain
naïve
social
theories
of
about
a
hundred
years
earlier
spearman
naïve
slade
before
i
went
in
for
engineering
sir
i
majored
in
history
at
mcgill
with
the
help
of
a
great
deal
of
coffee
i
even
read
it
is
not
logical
even
from
its
own
dogmatic
premises
incidentally
i
think
it
can
still
be
found
in
secondhand
bookstores
spearman
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
i
left
earth
it
was
quite
readily
available
in
editions
from
the
collectivist
press
slade
oh
yes
i
dare
say
it
was
well
kamon
about
a
hundred
years
ago
those
two
asian
states
still
paying
lip
service
to
the
debatable
doctrine
of
communism
satisfactory
mr
spearman
attacked
each
other
in
a
long
war
making
use
of
recently
discovered
atomic
weapons
as
well
as
pestilence
and
other
devices
it
was
not
actually
a
doctrinal
war
but
simply
a
power
struggle
between
two
tyrannies
it
was
hideous
incredibly
destructive
and
the
only
saving
thing
about
it
was
that
it
prevented
them
from
visiting
the
same
disaster
on
the
rest
of
the
world
neither
side
won
of
course
a
few
decades
later
a
new
dictator
a
little
zealot
from
mongolia
inherited
the
desolation
and
built
on
the
ruins
a
new
monolithic
state
which
still
exists
arek
but
what
actually
was
this
theory
this
communism
slade
oh
the
theory
originally
an
appeal
to
the
dispossessed
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
earlier
there
were
masses
of
poor
widespread
suffering
and
injustice
too
much
economic
and
political
power
in
the
hands
of
a
few
who
abused
their
power
with
stupidity
and
cruelty
marx
and
other
theorists
imagined
or
said
they
imagined
that
the
situation
could
be
remedied
by
reversal
give
power
to
the
dispossessed
the
proletariat
as
they
called
them
and
injustice
would
right
itself
why
they
imagined
that
the
proletariat
was
any
more
fitted
to
rule
than
its
oppressors
why
they
supposed
it
would
not
abuse
power
quite
as
viciously
they
never
bothered
to
explain
naturally
the
realists
among
them
were
concerned
with
any
utopian
outcome
they
simply
saw
the
doctrine
as
a
means
to
personal
power
for
themselves
and
used
it
accordingly
the
first
important
one
of
these
was
a
furious
little
man
named
lenin
he
may
have
believed
his
own
theories
for
a
while
there
seems
to
have
been
some
experimentation
with
the
contradictions
of
actual
communism
when
he
first
won
power
in
russia
but
absolute
power
corrupts
absolutely
as
somebody
said
the
foundations
of
an
despotism
were
well
established
before
he
died
and
was
unofficially
deified
and
kept
in
a
glass
case
for
the
consolation
of
the
atheist
faithful
matter
of
fact
arek
a
good
many
things
in
earth
history
would
make
a
cat
laugh
the
actual
cure
for
the
ugly
situation
that
existed
turned
out
to
be
a
gradual
economic
leveling
combined
with
the
very
slow
and
difficult
growth
of
representative
government
so
that
there
would
be
no
swollen
fortunes
no
severe
poverty
and
no
heavy
concentrations
of
unchecked
political
power
but
that
was
most
undramatic
procedure
it
needed
the
work
of
centuries
no
bloody
revolution
could
ever
achieve
such
an
end
nor
could
any
other
evil
means
ever
bring
it
any
nearer
in
the
federation
we
begin
to
have
an
approximation
of
it
the
asian
empire
is
merely
despotism
old
and
stale
old
as
the
pharaohs
committed
to
the
policy
of
violence
and
carrying
the
burden
of
slavery
under
modern
names
the
natural
product
of
fanatic
doctrine
after
the
have
taken
it
over
and
made
use
of
it
spearman
jenga
empire
is
not
collectivism
it
is
a
perversion
of
it
ann
if
you
excuse
me
dorothy
honey
of
course
i
think
you
got
up
too
soon
the
boys
are
in
bed
come
on
let
me
tuck
you
in
and
fuss
at
you
stern
she
been
ill
wright
yes
for
a
long
time
but
now
i
think
she
spearman
what
arek
captain
tell
us
about
the
other
part
of
earth
the
part
you
come
from
slade
canada
oh
you
mean
the
federation
itself
it
very
great
miss
i
mean
arek
let
have
the
map
again
my
dear
all
of
north
america
here
parts
of
south
america
the
united
states
of
europe
union
of
islam
japan
india
parts
of
africa
outside
of
islam
then
over
here
australia
and
new
zealand
and
here
the
republic
of
oceania
almost
all
the
rest
of
the
world
you
see
federal
city
find
it
follow
my
finger
east
of
winnipeg
lake
country
and
very
lovely
i
was
born
near
there
the
city
was
planned
and
built
new
in
seems
long
ago
is
really
and
then
arek
there
are
some
small
countries
which
have
preferred
to
keep
their
national
unity
outside
of
the
federation
instead
of
inside
it
although
they
affiliated
with
us
and
there
are
any
barriers
to
travel
and
other
intercourse
a
somewhat
technical
distinction
since
local
sovereignties
are
well
enough
preserved
within
the
federation
wright
not
entirely
a
technicality
at
the
time
we
left
earth
there
were
some
tendencies
in
the
federation
that
could
lead
to
overcentralization
even
with
the
recognition
of
limited
powers
and
too
much
emphasis
on
the
admitted
glories
of
machine
civilization
i
think
it
an
excellent
thing
that
some
parts
of
the
world
should
be
a
little
insulated
from
the
enthusiasms
of
material
progress
the
federation
itself
will
be
the
better
for
it
slade
perhaps
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
doctor
i
was
always
a
man
myself
still
under
the
threat
of
jenga
stern
i
ca
see
it
as
much
of
a
threat
sally
marino
i
do
know
stern
the
empire
will
break
down
sooner
or
later
of
its
own
rigidity
slade
but
while
we
wait
for
that
the
federation
has
to
be
strong
in
the
military
as
well
as
other
senses
mukerji
if
we
do
just
wait
for
it
stern
preventive
war
is
an
absurdity
jimmy
mukerji
yes
but
stern
gradualist
methods
the
federation
can
afford
to
wait
the
same
gradualist
methods
that
made
the
union
of
islam
possible
so
long
ago
paul
i
do
think
the
leadership
of
turkey
was
gradualist
exactly
dr
stem
it
took
thirty
years
after
but
considering
the
problem
that
was
great
speed
only
a
people
with
immense
moral
courage
and
good
sense
would
have
dared
to
undertake
it
at
all
they
were
fanatics
they
ridden
by
the
devil
of
one
idea
they
had
to
work
with
intelligent
compromise
temperate
adjustments
yielding
here
and
sternness
there
and
patience
all
the
time
but
once
they
took
up
the
task
they
did
rest
or
let
go
and
by
there
was
a
healthy
union
ready
for
full
membership
in
the
federation
slade
yes
that
was
speed
i
expect
you
given
your
friends
here
a
pretty
good
account
of
earth
history
paul
we
tried
i
do
know
if
we
can
allow
ourselves
more
than
a
the
subject
is
too
enormous
and
all
we
had
were
imperfect
memories
in
the
midst
of
our
own
work
for
lucifer
which
is
paramount
wright
not
even
books
captain
when
you
showed
us
over
the
ship
it
was
very
difficult
for
my
fingers
not
to
steal
a
lens
and
a
pocketful
of
those
microtexts
slade
my
dear
friend
why
did
you
say
so
all
you
want
that
for
your
friends
here
entirely
no
need
to
take
any
of
our
library
back
to
earth
if
they
can
use
it
wright
i
excuse
me
i
do
know
what
to
say
slade
and
by
the
way
doctor
before
i
forget
again
to
mention
it
after
you
left
i
think
it
was
in
they
perfected
a
new
drug
which
actually
makes
the
accelerations
quite
bearable
i
do
know
too
much
about
it
muscular
relaxation
is
a
factor
and
nora
can
tell
you
more
about
it
but
i
understand
that
even
for
persons
past
the
optimum
age
wright
a
moment
please
i
can
not
go
back
to
earth
captain
slade
you
mean
it
with
the
greatest
kindness
but
it
is
impossible
slade
why
forgive
me
i
supposed
i
took
it
for
granted
wright
my
place
is
here
this
is
my
work
these
are
my
people
tejron
i
knew
i
knew
wright
what
my
dear
i
do
understand
tejron
oh
i
should
keep
silent
this
is
for
you
to
decide
but
you
said
it
you
wo
leave
us
wright
no
no
i
wo
ever
leave
you
this
is
my
home
slade
but
spearman
ca
argue
with
the
passion
of
an
expatriate
the
grass
is
always
greener
paul
it
could
be
no
other
way
captain
at
least
for
wright
and
me
and
i
certain
my
wife
will
say
the
same
when
she
comes
back
wright
in
some
ways
captain
the
distance
between
earth
and
lucifer
is
greater
than
the
simple
light
years
between
our
two
stars
slade
i
sorry
was
expecting
it
that
all
let
me
get
used
to
the
idea
a
little
spearman
you
can
consider
me
neutral
captain
slade
i
have
no
place
on
lucifer
one
more
utopia
idealism
running
contrary
to
obvious
facts
it
will
break
up
intellectual
quarrels
no
central
control
paul
until
sometime
a
strong
man
takes
over
and
makes
an
empire
out
of
it
wright
please
spearman
no
comment
stern
if
i
might
differ
with
you
spearman
it
seems
to
me
after
being
shown
over
this
lovely
island
the
domesticated
cattle
and
those
wonderful
white
beasts
the
plantations
and
the
houses
the
perfect
english
and
adult
thinking
of
our
new
friends
above
all
the
school
it
seems
to
me
that
wright
and
his
colleagues
are
realists
of
the
first
water
of
course
i
strongly
prejudiced
in
their
favor
because
well
during
the
twelve
years
of
our
journey
i
dreamed
constantly
of
some
such
achievement
as
this
myself
so
it
like
coming
home
i
a
doctor
spearman
before
i
was
chosen
for
the
journey
i
ran
a
clinic
as
an
intern
i
had
a
lot
of
ambulance
and
emergency
service
at
one
of
the
big
hospitals
in
melbourne
i
saw
a
superabundance
of
let
call
them
obvious
facts
now
i
think
the
sunny
quiet
here
the
good
health
and
intelligence
of
the
children
the
gardens
the
devotion
of
these
people
to
each
other
and
to
their
work
the
searching
thought
they
given
to
their
laws
and
their
future
i
fancy
those
are
obvious
facts
too
wright
man
is
neither
good
nor
bad
but
both
but
he
can
swing
the
balance
stern
too
right
i
think
i
understand
you
doctor
why
you
want
to
stay
here
i
think
i
understand
it
very
well
slade
i
would
urge
you
it
only
that
i
took
something
else
for
granted
foolishly
let
me
be
just
a
listener
elis
and
let
me
fill
your
cup
you
behind
us
captain
miniaan
the
big
jug
is
empty
happen
muson
portrait
of
a
fat
woman
going
away
with
another
big
jug
paul
bless
you
lady
muson
it
was
you
that
finished
emptying
it
i
think
nisana
could
have
been
me
stern
are
there
any
important
physiological
differences
wright
nothing
of
first
importance
minor
differences
in
blood
chemistry
shape
of
hands
and
feet
our
friends
have
the
hind
brain
in
the
spinal
column
which
may
be
the
reason
for
their
better
muscular
and
you
know
doctor
i
have
often
wished
that
the
human
race
of
earth
which
we
call
charin
had
more
room
in
its
head
for
the
expansion
of
the
frontal
lobes
elis
i
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
your
frontal
lobes
christopher
wright
i
have
noticed
that
sometimes
a
large
skull
merely
rattles
stern
just
the
same
the
point
is
well
taken
paul
might
call
it
the
miracle
of
the
lobes
and
wishes
pakriaa
why
do
you
wait
till
muson
comes
back
sally
marino
do
you
now
maybe
this
is
a
foolish
question
do
you
have
to
work
awfully
hard
i
mean
with
so
few
technical
aids
the
oh
oil
lamps
the
necessarily
primitive
of
course
you
done
miracles
to
have
as
much
as
you
do
have
starting
from
almost
nothing
what
trying
to
say
does
mere
survival
take
up
so
much
time
and
effort
that
it
well
wears
you
down
paul
we
have
shelter
clothing
enough
to
eat
miniaan
and
drink
paul
what
we
call
a
family
sally
is
made
up
of
members
of
all
three
races
such
a
unit
may
have
seven
or
eight
adults
or
more
shelter
food
the
basic
needs
are
supplied
by
each
family
working
for
itself
the
large
family
unit
distributes
the
labor
pretty
well
and
if
any
family
was
stricken
with
misfortune
none
has
been
so
far
the
others
would
all
help
as
a
matter
of
course
now
we
do
have
the
germs
of
beginning
industries
in
textiles
sugar
miniaan
wine
making
abara
the
lady
is
pied
miniaan
the
lady
is
not
pied
only
very
happy
and
vestoia
is
a
dead
city
and
the
little
illuama
will
be
making
their
nests
where
oh
abara
you
venerable
ruin
i
love
you
i
love
you
abara
well
not
right
here
in
front
of
all
these
nice
people
mukerji
beautiful
way
of
life
oh
here
muson
have
we
drunk
to
everybody
seems
as
though
we
must
have
overlooked
somebody
earlier
nisana
i
do
think
so
yes
we
have
let
drink
to
the
olifants
wright
and
their
seven
calves
paul
in
textiles
for
instance
nisana
does
no
housework
because
her
worktime
is
at
the
loom
each
household
sends
somebody
over
to
work
in
the
fiber
and
sugar
plantations
across
the
lake
the
system
works
sally
in
this
very
tiny
community
where
everyone
knows
and
respects
everyone
else
where
all
the
laws
and
customs
encourage
the
ironing
out
of
differences
before
they
become
serious
and
so
far
work
has
never
become
oppressive
most
of
it
we
enjoy
the
boring
unpleasing
jobs
are
shared
because
we
know
they
have
to
be
done
and
we
do
want
anyone
to
have
to
carry
too
much
of
their
weight
and
so
far
we
do
hunger
for
the
complex
and
fascinating
possessions
we
knew
on
earth
such
hungers
will
come
communities
will
grow
the
best
laws
will
fail
sometimes
there
will
be
disputes
mistakes
injustices
but
we
are
forewarned
by
memories
of
earth
doc
i
trying
to
say
things
you
could
say
better
wright
no
go
on
paul
well
we
plan
tentatively
a
hundred
family
units
here
at
jensen
city
a
population
of
maybe
a
thousand
adults
no
larger
when
that
point
is
reached
several
years
away
then
we
must
plan
and
build
another
town
probably
here
on
the
island
at
that
point
we
add
new
problems
and
perplexities
we
may
not
need
a
monetary
system
until
there
are
several
towns
when
we
do
it
will
not
develop
haphazardly
but
with
the
aid
of
all
past
knowledge
we
possess
for
safeguard
and
guidance
slade
and
when
there
are
fifteen
or
twenty
such
communities
paul
they
will
want
an
government
a
miniature
of
a
federal
system
we
suppose
a
republic
with
fully
functional
representative
procedures
checked
and
safeguarded
against
every
abuse
of
power
because
in
all
our
study
and
memories
of
history
we
found
no
other
type
of
government
that
can
operate
with
fairness
to
majorities
and
minorities
alike
and
leave
men
as
free
as
any
social
animal
can
ever
be
free
for
that
matter
captain
we
sometimes
glance
ahead
to
a
time
when
there
will
be
hundreds
or
thousands
of
towns
a
time
when
our
of
all
three
races
may
want
to
experiment
with
large
cities
elaborate
industries
such
things
will
bring
their
own
heavy
difficulties
but
we
have
reason
to
hope
that
our
will
have
the
patience
and
courage
to
solve
them
as
they
arise
brodaa
tell
them
about
the
school
brodaa
i
am
not
good
in
exposition
paul
we
are
strict
captain
that
the
children
should
learn
all
the
tested
factual
knowledge
we
can
give
them
they
must
read
speak
write
clearly
precisely
honestly
we
do
not
allow
them
to
leave
a
method
half
learned
a
task
half
done
if
there
is
a
question
they
must
search
for
an
answer
if
there
is
no
sufficient
answer
known
they
must
learn
to
test
the
insufficient
answers
and
wait
judgment
my
own
language
has
flaws
i
am
an
old
woman
i
still
go
to
school
to
paul
mashana
dorothy
wright
to
learn
more
for
my
own
sake
and
for
the
little
ones
i
teach
they
must
learn
the
fundamental
methods
and
facts
as
soon
as
they
can
start
to
think
at
all
we
are
never
afraid
of
teaching
any
child
too
much
or
too
soon
we
respect
them
oh
mashana
i
was
wishing
you
would
return
dorothy
need
has
arisen
for
the
dope
what
goes
on
more
or
less
elis
education
paul
how
is
spearman
how
is
she
dorothy
she
is
asleep
ed
nothing
to
worry
about
pakriaa
she
will
be
healed
mijok
education
on
lucifer
pakriaa
and
i
have
the
pleasantest
part
of
the
teaching
i
think
we
show
them
the
ways
of
the
forest
and
the
open
ground
the
plants
and
other
living
things
how
to
hunt
without
cruelty
or
waste
how
to
be
safe
and
happy
alone
in
the
woods
at
night
when
to
fear
and
not
to
fear
as
samis
shows
them
the
care
of
the
tame
beasts
and
the
work
in
the
plantations

dorothy
such
comment
from
a
lady
allowed
to
sit
up

such
i
might
add
perfectly
accurate
comment
sleepy
baby
helen
not
a
bit
dorothy
you
are
too
you
snuggle
like
a
kitten
half
full
of
milk
half
an
hour
huh
helen
mm
wright
we
see
to
it
captain
that
our
children
are
not
stuffed
with
inflated
words
equivocal
words
when
you
talk
with
them
they
wo
be
chattering
to
you
about
freedom
democracy
truth
justice
they
learn
these
words
closely
we
see
to
it
that
they
learn
them
with
caution
when
they
use
them
we
say
define
define
democracy
by
what
means
within
what
limits
toward
what
end
freedom
from
what
for
what
for
what
the
profit
if
i
rattle
on
about
freedom
in
a
semantic
vacuum
i
am
free
to
speak
not
free
to
kill
and
wound
i
must
be
free
from
slavery
to
the
whims
of
others
i
can
never
be
free
from
the
bonds
of
a
hundred
duties
responsibilities
loyalties
to
persons
i
love
and
principles
i
cherish
words
without
definition
are
sheer
noise
and
noise
never
drummed
any
race
into
paradise
oh
the
obvious
as
a
child
building
blocks
but
i
recall
how
on
earth
men
tended
to
forget
it
hours
a
day
and
here
on
lucifer
we
forget
it
often
enough
myself
included
but
we
do
not
forget
it
when
we
teach
our
children
one
other
thing
before
this
wine
takes
me
back
to
second
childhood
as
soon
captain
as
their
minds
are
old
enough
arek
where
did
spearman
go
wright
oh
he
he
just
stepped
out
i
think
stretch
his
legs
or
something
as
soon
as
their
minds
are
old
enough
to
think
with
some
independence
and
explore
we
insist
that
they
start
the
lifetime
struggle
with
man
primary
dilemma
elis
i
hoped
you
would
speak
of
that
my
brother
wright
that
he
is
an
individual
his
precious
and
inviolate
yet
he
must
live
in
harmony
with
other
individuals
whose
right
to
life
and
welfare
is
as
certain
as
his
own
approach
the
study
of
society
from
any
direction
you
will
that
problem
is
at
the
heart
of
it
and
must
be
a
thousand
generations
from
now
because
it
must
be
met
anew
with
every
infant
born
we
think
here
that
the
most
rewarding
answer
is
in
the
old
virtues
of
charity
honesty
forbearance
patience
now
those
are
all
words
that
demand
definition
and
multiple
definition
on
that
basis
we
have
our
children
study
them
search
the
depth
and
height
of
them
in
the
not
so
simple
problems
of
childhood
through
the
tougher
ones
of
adolescence
and
maturity
we
make
them
understand
that
lip
service
will
not
do
if
one
is
to
make
himself
honest
he
must
eat
honesty
with
breakfast
sweat
with
it
in
the
sun
laugh
and
play
and
suffer
with
it
and
lie
down
with
it
at
night
until
it
near
as
the
oxygen
in
his
blood
yes
we
aim
high
cruelly
high
would
you
say
we
do
think
so
perfection
is
a
cold
spot
on
top
of
a
mountain
and
nobody
ever
climbed
there
we
have
trouble
and
fun
and
arguments
sometimes
the
garden
weeds
grow
until
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
but
we
sleep
well
dorothy
speaking
of
perfection
and
goodness
and
things
and
stuff
i
know
it
was
paul
who
put
those
violin
strings
by
nan
bed
but
which
one
of
you
supplied
them
slade
well
he
told
me
dorothy
will
it
be
all
right
if
i
reach
over
this
daughter
of
mine
and
kiss
you
slade
they
did
brief
us
back
on
earth
that
we
must
respect
local
customs
mijok
and
perhaps
even
another
drink
could
do
him
no
harm
pakriaa
he
pied
elis
i
would
not
say
that
speaking
as
governor
i
say
that
the
local
wine
industry
deserves
every
encouragement
it
can
get
and
has
ever
since
samis
favorite
kink

kittens
in
the
bottom
of

happy

give
you
the
wine
itself
and
the
earth
that
made
it
i
give
you
birth
and
death
and
the
journey
of
our
days
and
nights
between
them
the
shining
of
green
fields
the
patience
of
the
forest
the
little
stars
the
great
stars
the
love
and
the
thought
the
labor
and
the
laughter
the
good
morning
sky
