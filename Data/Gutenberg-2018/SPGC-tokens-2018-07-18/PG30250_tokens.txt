five
stages
of
greek
religion
by
gilbert
murray
boston
the
beacon
press
preface
to
the
third
edition
anyone
who
has
been
in
greece
at
easter
time
especially
among
the
more
remote
peasants
must
have
been
struck
by
the
emotion
of
suspense
and
excitement
with
which
they
wait
for
the
announcement
christ
is
risen
and
the
response
he
has
really
risen
i
have
referred
elsewhere
to
lawson
old
peasant
woman
who
explained
her
anxiety
if
christ
does
not
rise
tomorrow
we
shall
have
no
harvest
this
year
greek
we
are
evidently
in
the
presence
of
an
emotion
and
a
fear
which
beneath
its
christian
colouring
and
so
to
speak
transfiguration
is
in
its
essence
like
most
of
man
deepest
emotions
a
relic
from
a
very
remote
past
every
spring
was
to
primitive
man
a
time
of
terrible
anxiety
his
store
of
food
was
near
its
end
would
the
dead
world
revive
or
would
it
not
the
old
year
was
dead
would
the
new
year
the
young
king
born
afresh
of
sky
and
earth
come
in
the
old
king
place
and
bring
with
him
the
new
growth
and
the
hope
of
life
i
hardly
realized
when
writing
the
earlier
editions
of
this
book
how
central
how
omnipresent
this
complex
of
ideas
was
in
ancient
greek
religion
attis
adonis
osiris
dionysus
and
the
rest
of
the
year
gods
were
not
eccentric
divagations
in
a
religion
whose
proper
worship
was
given
to
the
immortal
olympians
they
are
different
names
given
in
different
circumstances
to
this
one
being
who
dies
and
is
born
again
each
year
dies
old
and
polluted
with
past
deaths
and
sins
and
is
reborn
young
and
purified
i
have
tried
to
trace
this
line
of
tradition
in
an
article
for
the
of
hellenic
for
june
and
to
show
incidentally
how
many
of
the
elements
in
the
christian
tradition
it
has
provided
especially
those
elements
which
are
utterly
alien
from
hebrew
monotheism
and
must
indeed
have
shocked
every
orthodox
jew
the
best
starting
point
is
the
conception
of
the
series
of
old
kings
each
when
the
due
time
comes
dethroned
and
replaced
by
his
son
the
young
king
with
the
help
of
the
queen
mother
for
gaia
or
earth
the
eternal
wife
and
mother
of
each
in
turn
is
always
ready
to
renew
herself
the
new
vegetation
god
each
year
is
born
from
the
union
of
the
and
the
or
as
in
myth
and
legend
the
figures
become
personified
he
is
the
son
of
a
god
and
a
mortal
princess
we
all
know
the
sequence
of
kings
in
hesiod
first
uranus
sky
king
of
the
world
and
his
wife
gaia
earth
uranus
reigns
till
he
is
dethroned
by
his
son
cronos
with
the
help
of
gaia
then
cronos
and
rhea
earth
reign
till
cronos
is
dethroned
by
his
son
zeus
with
the
help
of
rhea
then
zeus
reigns
till
but
here
the
series
stops
since
according
to
the
orthodox
olympian
system
zeus
is
the
eternal
king
but
there
was
another
system
underlying
the
olympian
and
it
is
to
that
other
system
that
the
belong
the
olympians
are
definite
persons
they
are
immortal
they
do
not
die
and
revive
they
are
not
beings
who
come
and
go
in
succession
to
one
another
in
the
other
series
are
the
type
of
gods
and
especially
dionysus
whose
name
has
been
shown
by
kretschmer
to
be
simply
the
thracian
or
or
and
in
the
orphic
tradition
it
is
laid
down
that
zeus
yields
up
his
power
to
dionysus
and
bids
all
the
gods
of
the
cosmos
obey
him
the
mother
of
dionysus
was
semelÃª
a
name
which
like
gaia
and
rhea
means
earth
the
series
is
not
only
continuous
but
infinite
for
on
one
side
uranus
sky
was
himself
the
son
of
gaia
the
eternal
and
on
the
other
every
year
a
zeus
was
succeeded
by
a
young
zeus
the
young
king
bearer
of
spring
and
the
new
summer
is
the
saviour
of
the
earth
made
cold
and
lifeless
by
winter
and
doomed
to
barrenness
by
all
the
pollutions
of
the
past
the
saviour
also
of
mankind
from
all
kinds
of
evils
and
bringer
of
a
new
or
age
to
the
world
innumerable
different
figures
in
greek
mythology
are
personifications
of
him
from
dionysus
and
heracles
to
the
dioscuri
and
many
heroes
of
myth
he
bears
certain
distinguishing
marks
he
is
always
the
son
of
a
god
and
a
mortal
princess
the
mother
is
always
persecuted
a
and
rescued
by
her
son
the
son
is
always
a
saviour
very
often
a
champion
who
saves
his
people
from
enemies
or
monsters
but
sometimes
a
healer
of
the
sick
like
asclepius
sometimes
like
dionysus
a
priest
or
hierophant
with
a
or
band
of
worshippers
sometimes
a
king
son
who
is
sacrificed
to
save
his
people
and
mystically
identified
with
some
sacrificial
animal
a
lamb
a
young
bull
a
horse
or
a
fawn
whose
blood
has
supernatural
power
sometimes
again
he
is
a
divine
or
miraculous
babe
for
whose
birth
the
whole
world
has
been
waiting
who
will
bring
his
own
age
or
kingdom
and
make
all
things
new
his
life
is
almost
always
threatened
by
a
cruel
king
like
herod
but
he
always
escapes
the
popularity
of
the
divine
babe
is
probably
due
to
the
very
widespread
worship
of
the
egyptian
harpocrates
egyptian
also
is
the
impregnated
by
the
holy
or
of
the
god
or
sometimes
by
the
laying
on
of
his
hand
besides
the
ordinary
death
and
rebirth
of
the
vegetation
year
god
the
general
conclusion
to
which
these
considerations
point
has
many
parallels
elsewhere
our
own
religious
ideas
are
subject
to
the
same
tendencies
as
those
of
other
civilizations
men
and
women
when
converted
to
a
new
religion
or
instructed
in
some
new
and
unaccustomed
knowledge
are
extremely
unwilling
and
sometimes
absolutely
unable
to
give
up
their
old
magical
or
religious
practices
and
habits
of
thought
when
african
negroes
are
converted
to
christianity
and
forbidden
to
practise
their
tribal
magic
they
are
apt
to
steal
away
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
and
do
secretly
what
they
have
always
considered
necessary
to
ensure
a
good
harvest
not
to
do
so
would
be
too
great
a
risk
when
goths
were
converted
by
battalions
the
change
must
have
been
more
in
names
than
in
substance
when
greeks
of
the
mediterranean
were
forbidden
to
say
prayers
to
a
figure
of
helios
the
sun
it
was
not
difficult
to
call
him
the
prophet
elias
and
go
on
with
the
same
prayers
and
hopes
not
difficult
to
continue
your
prayers
to
the
mother
goddess
of
all
mediterranean
peoples
while
calling
her
mary
the
mother
of
christ
eusebius
studied
the
subject
somewhat
superficially
in
his
in
which
he
argued
that
much
old
pagan
belief
was
to
be
explained
as
an
imperfect
preparation
for
the
full
light
of
the
gospel
and
it
is
certainly
striking
how
the
anatolian
peoples
among
whom
the
seed
of
the
early
church
was
chiefly
sown
could
never
in
spite
of
jewish
monotheism
give
up
the
beloved
mother
goddess
for
whom
mankind
craves
or
the
divine
faithful
son
who
will
by
his
own
sacrifice
save
his
people
where
scientific
knowledge
fails
man
can
not
but
be
guided
by
his
felt
needs
and
longings
and
aspirations
the
elements
in
christianity
which
derive
from
what
jews
called
or
nations
beyond
the
pale
seem
to
be
far
deeper
and
more
numerous
than
those
which
come
unchanged
from
judaism
even
the
sabbath
had
to
be
changed
and
the
birthday
of
jesus
conformed
to
that
of
the
sun
judaism
contributed
a
strong
though
not
quite
successful
resistance
to
polytheism
and
a
purification
of
sexual
morality
it
provided
perhaps
a
general
antiseptic
which
was
often
needed
by
the
passionate
gropings
of
hellenistic
religion
in
the
stage
which
i
call
the
failure
of
nerve
preface
to
the
second
edition
in
revising
the
stages
of
greek
i
have
found
myself
obliged
to
change
its
name
i
felt
there
was
a
gap
in
the
story
the
mark
of
greek
religious
thought
seems
to
me
to
have
come
just
between
the
olympian
religion
and
the
failure
of
nerve
and
the
decline
if
that
is
the
right
word
which
is
observable
in
the
later
ages
of
antiquity
is
a
decline
not
from
olympianism
but
from
the
great
spiritual
and
intellectual
effort
of
the
fourth
century
which
culminated
in
the
and
the
and
the
foundation
of
the
stoa
and
the
garden
consequently
i
have
added
a
new
chapter
at
this
point
and
raised
the
number
of
stages
to
five
my
friend
genner
has
kindly
enabled
me
to
correct
two
or
three
errors
in
the
first
edition
and
i
owe
special
thanks
to
my
old
pupil
professor
dodds
for
several
interesting
observations
and
criticisms
on
points
connected
with
plotinus
and
sallustius
otherwise
i
have
altered
little
i
am
only
sorry
to
have
left
the
book
so
long
out
of
print
preface
to
the
first
edition
this
small
book
has
taken
a
long
time
in
growing
though
the
first
two
essays
were
only
put
in
writing
this
year
for
a
course
of
lectures
which
i
had
the
honour
of
delivering
at
columbia
university
in
the
third
which
was
also
used
at
columbia
had
in
its
main
features
appeared
in
the
in
the
fourth
in
part
in
the
in
the
translation
of
sallustius
was
made
in
for
use
with
a
small
class
at
oxford
much
of
the
material
is
much
older
in
conception
and
all
has
been
reconsidered
i
must
thank
the
editors
of
both
the
periodicals
for
their
kind
permission
to
reprint
i
think
it
was
the
writings
of
my
friend
andrew
lang
that
first
awoke
me
in
my
undergraduate
days
to
the
importance
of
anthropology
and
primitive
religion
to
a
greek
scholar
certainly
i
began
then
to
feel
that
the
great
works
of
the
ancient
greek
imagination
are
penetrated
habitually
by
religious
conceptions
and
postulates
which
literary
scholars
like
myself
had
not
observed
or
understood
in
the
meantime
the
situation
has
changed
greek
religion
is
being
studied
right
and
left
and
has
revealed
itself
as
a
surprisingly
rich
and
attractive
though
somewhat
controversial
subject
it
used
to
be
a
deserted
territory
now
it
is
at
least
a
if
ever
the
present
differences
resolved
themselves
into
a
simple
fight
with
shillelaghs
between
the
scholars
and
the
anthropologists
i
should
without
doubt
wield
my
reluctant
weapon
on
the
side
of
the
scholars
scholarship
is
the
rarer
harder
less
popular
and
perhaps
the
more
permanently
valuable
work
and
it
certainly
stands
more
in
need
of
defence
at
the
moment
but
in
the
meantime
i
can
hardly
understand
how
the
purest
of
scholars
can
fail
to
feel
his
knowledge
enriched
by
the
savants
who
have
compelled
us
to
dig
below
the
surface
of
our
classical
tradition
and
to
realize
the
imaginative
and
historical
problems
which
so
often
lie
concealed
beneath
the
smooth
security
of
a
verbal
my
own
essays
do
not
for
a
moment
claim
to
speak
with
authority
on
a
subject
which
is
still
changing
and
showing
new
facets
year
by
year
they
only
claim
to
represent
the
way
of
regarding
certain
large
issues
of
greek
religion
which
has
gradually
taken
shape
and
has
proved
practically
helpful
and
consistent
with
facts
in
the
mind
of
a
very
constant
though
unsystematic
reader
of
many
various
periods
of
greek
literature
in
the
first
essay
my
debt
to
miss
harrison
is
great
and
obvious
my
statement
of
one
or
two
points
is
probably
different
from
hers
but
in
the
main
i
follow
her
lead
and
in
either
case
i
can
not
adequately
describe
the
advantage
i
have
derived
from
many
years
of
frequent
discussion
and
comparison
of
results
with
a
hellenist
whose
learning
and
originality
of
mind
are
only
equalled
by
her
vivid
generosity
towards
her
the
second
may
also
be
said
to
have
grown
out
of
miss
writings
she
has
by
now
made
the
title
of
almost
a
term
of
reproach
and
thrown
down
so
many
a
scornful
challenge
to
the
canonical
gods
of
greece
that
i
have
ventured
on
this
attempt
to
explain
their
historical
origin
and
plead
for
their
religious
value
when
the
essay
was
already
written
i
read
chadwick
impressive
book
on
heroic
cambridge
and
was
delighted
to
find
in
an
author
whose
standpoint
and
equipment
are
so
different
from
mine
so
much
that
confirmed
or
clarified
my
own
view
the
title
of
the
third
essay
i
owe
to
a
conversation
with
professor
j
b
bury
we
were
discussing
the
change
that
took
place
in
greek
thought
between
say
plato
and
the
or
even
between
aristotle
and
posidonius
and
which
is
seen
at
its
highest
power
in
the
gnostics
i
had
been
calling
it
a
rise
of
asceticism
or
mysticism
or
religious
passion
or
the
like
when
my
friend
corrected
me
is
not
a
rise
it
is
a
fall
or
failure
of
something
a
sort
of
failure
of
nerve
we
are
treading
here
upon
somewhat
firmer
ground
than
in
the
first
two
essays
the
field
for
mere
conjecture
is
less
we
are
supported
more
continuously
by
explicit
documents
yet
the
subject
is
a
very
difficult
one
owing
to
the
scattered
and
chaotic
nature
of
the
sources
and
even
where
we
get
away
from
fragments
and
reconstructions
and
reach
definite
treatises
with
or
without
authors
names
i
can
not
pretend
to
feel
anything
like
the
same
clearness
about
the
true
meaning
of
a
passage
in
philo
or
the
corpus
hermeticum
that
one
normally
feels
in
a
writer
of
the
classical
period
consequently
in
this
essay
i
think
i
have
hugged
my
modern
authorities
rather
close
and
seldom
expressed
an
opinion
for
which
i
could
not
find
some
fairly
authoritative
backing
my
debt
being
particularly
great
to
reitzenstein
bousset
and
the
brilliant
of
wendland
i
must
also
thank
my
old
pupil
edwyn
bevan
who
was
kind
enough
to
read
this
book
in
proof
for
some
valuable
criticisms
the
subject
is
one
of
such
extraordinary
interest
that
i
offer
no
apology
for
calling
further
attention
to
it
a
word
or
two
about
the
last
brief
revival
of
the
ancient
religion
under
the
apostate
forms
the
natural
close
to
this
series
of
studies
but
here
our
material
both
historical
and
literary
is
so
abundant
that
i
have
followed
a
different
method
after
a
short
historical
introduction
i
have
translated
in
full
a
very
curious
and
ancient
text
which
may
be
said
to
constitute
something
like
an
authoritative
pagan
creed
some
readers
may
regret
that
i
do
not
give
the
greek
as
well
as
the
english
i
am
reluctant
however
to
publish
a
text
which
i
have
not
examined
in
the
and
i
feel
also
that
while
an
edition
of
sallustius
is
rather
urgently
needed
it
ought
to
be
an
edition
with
a
full
commentary
i
was
first
led
to
these
studies
by
the
wish
to
fill
up
certain
puzzling
blanks
of
ignorance
in
my
own
mind
and
doubtless
the
little
book
bears
marks
of
this
origin
it
aims
largely
at
the
filling
of
interstices
it
avoids
the
great
illuminated
places
and
gives
its
mind
to
the
stretches
of
intervening
twilight
it
deals
little
with
the
harvest
of
flowers
or
fruit
but
watches
the
inconspicuous
seasons
when
the
soil
is
beginning
to
stir
the
seeds
are
falling
or
ripening

many
persons
who
are
quite
prepared
to
admit
the
importance
to
the
world
of
greek
poetry
greek
art
and
greek
philosophy
may
still
feel
it
rather
a
paradox
to
be
told
that
greek
religion
specially
repays
our
study
at
the
present
day
greek
religion
associated
with
a
romantic
trivial
and
not
very
edifying
mythology
has
generally
seemed
one
of
the
weakest
spots
in
the
armour
of
those
giants
of
the
old
world
yet
i
will
venture
to
make
for
greek
religion
almost
as
great
a
claim
as
for
the
thought
and
the
literature
not
only
because
the
whole
mass
of
it
is
shot
through
by
those
strange
lights
of
feeling
and
imagination
and
the
details
of
it
constantly
wrought
into
beauty
by
that
instinctive
sense
of
artistic
form
which
we
specially
associate
with
classical
greece
but
also
for
two
definite
historical
reasons
in
the
first
place
the
student
of
that
dark
and
fascinating
department
of
the
human
mind
which
we
may
call
religious
origins
will
find
in
greece
an
extraordinary
mass
of
material
belonging
to
a
very
early
date
for
detail
and
variety
the
primitive
greek
evidence
has
no
equal
and
secondly
in
this
department
as
in
others
ancient
greece
has
the
triumphant
if
tragic
distinction
of
beginning
at
the
very
bottom
and
struggling
however
precariously
to
the
very
summits
there
is
hardly
any
horror
of
primitive
superstition
of
which
we
can
not
find
some
distant
traces
in
our
greek
record
there
is
hardly
any
height
of
spiritual
thought
attained
in
the
world
that
has
not
its
archetype
or
its
echo
in
the
stretch
of
greek
literature
that
lies
between
thales
and
plotinus
embracing
much
of
the
and
of
paul
the
progress
of
greek
religion
falls
naturally
into
three
stages
all
of
them
historically
important
first
there
is
the
primitive
or
age
of
ignorance
before
zeus
came
to
trouble
men
minds
a
stage
to
which
our
anthropologists
and
explorers
have
found
parallels
in
every
part
of
the
world
preuss
applies
to
it
the
charming
word
or
stupidity
in
some
ways
characteristically
greek
in
others
it
is
so
typical
of
similar
stages
of
thought
elsewhere
that
one
is
tempted
to
regard
it
as
the
normal
beginning
of
all
religion
or
almost
as
the
normal
raw
material
out
of
which
religion
is
made
there
is
certainly
some
repulsiveness
but
i
confess
that
to
me
there
is
also
an
element
of
fascination
in
the
study
of
these
devices
of
the
heathen
at
any
rate
as
they
appear
in
early
greece
where
each
single
device
as
it
passes
is
somehow
touched
with
beauty
and
transformed
by
some
spirit
of
upward
striving
secondly
there
is
the
olympian
or
classical
stage
a
stage
in
which
for
good
or
ill
blunderingly
or
successfully
this
primitive
vagueness
was
reduced
to
a
kind
of
order
this
is
the
stage
of
the
great
olympian
gods
who
dominated
art
and
poetry
ruled
the
imagination
of
rome
and
extended
a
kind
of
romantic
dominion
even
over
the
middle
ages
it
is
the
stage
that
we
learn
or
from
the
statues
and
the
handbooks
of
mythology
critics
have
said
that
this
olympian
stage
has
value
only
as
art
and
not
as
religion
that
is
just
one
of
the
points
into
which
we
shall
inquire
thirdly
there
is
the
hellenistic
period
reaching
roughly
from
plato
to
paul
and
the
earlier
gnostics
the
first
edition
of
this
book
treated
the
whole
period
as
one
but
i
have
now
divided
it
by
writing
a
new
chapter
on
the
movements
of
the
fourth
century
and
making
that
my
third
stage
this
was
the
time
when
the
greek
mind
still
in
its
full
creative
vigour
made
its
first
response
to
the
twofold
failure
of
the
world
in
which
it
had
put
its
faith
the
open
bankruptcy
of
the
olympian
religion
and
the
collapse
of
the
both
had
failed
and
each
tried
vainly
to
supply
the
place
of
the
other
greece
responded
by
the
creation
of
two
great
permanent
types
of
philosophy
which
have
influenced
human
ethics
ever
since
the
cynic
and
stoic
schools
on
the
one
hand
and
the
epicurean
on
the
other
these
schools
belong
properly
i
think
to
the
history
of
religion
the
successors
of
aristotle
produced
rather
a
school
of
progressive
science
those
of
plato
a
school
of
refined
scepticism
the
religious
side
of
plato
thought
was
not
revealed
in
its
full
power
till
the
time
of
plotinus
in
the
third
century
that
of
aristotle
one
might
say
without
undue
paradox
not
till
its
exposition
by
aquinas
in
the
thirteenth
the
old
third
stage
therefore
becomes
now
a
fourth
comprising
the
later
and
more
popular
movements
of
the
hellenistic
age
a
period
based
on
the
consciousness
of
manifold
failure
and
consequently
touched
both
with
morbidity
and
with
that
spiritual
exaltation
which
is
so
often
the
companion
of
morbidity
it
not
only
had
behind
it
the
failure
of
the
olympian
theology
and
of
the
free
now
crushed
by
military
monarchies
it
lived
through
the
gradual
realization
of
two
other
failures
the
failure
of
human
government
even
when
backed
by
the
power
of
rome
or
the
wealth
of
egypt
to
achieve
a
good
life
for
man
and
lastly
the
failure
of
the
great
propaganda
of
hellenism
in
which
the
effort
of
greece
to
educate
a
corrupt
and
barbaric
world
seemed
only
to
lead
to
the
corruption
or
barbarization
of
the
very
ideals
which
it
sought
to
spread
this
sense
of
failure
this
progressive
loss
of
hope
in
the
world
in
sober
calculation
and
in
organized
human
effort
threw
the
later
greek
back
upon
his
own
soul
upon
the
pursuit
of
personal
holiness
upon
emotions
mysteries
and
revelations
upon
the
comparative
neglect
of
this
transitory
and
imperfect
world
for
the
sake
of
some
far
off
which
shall
subsist
without
sin
or
corruption
the
same
yesterday
and
for
ever
these
four
are
the
really
significant
and
formative
periods
of
greek
religious
thought
but
we
may
well
cast
our
eyes
also
on
a
fifth
stage
not
historically
influential
perhaps
but
at
least
romantic
and
interesting
and
worthy
of
considerable
respect
when
the
old
religion
in
the
time
of
julian
roused
itself
for
a
last
spiritual
protest
against
the
of
the
christians
i
omit
plotinus
as
in
earlier
chapters
i
have
omitted
plato
and
aristotle
and
for
the
same
reason
as
a
rule
in
the
writings
of
julian
circle
and
still
more
in
the
remains
of
popular
belief
the
tendencies
of
our
fourth
stage
are
accentuated
by
an
increased
demand
for
definite
dogma
and
a
still
deeper
consciousness
of
worldly
defeat
i
shall
not
start
with
any
definition
of
religion
religion
like
poetry
and
most
other
living
things
can
not
be
defined
but
one
may
perhaps
give
some
description
of
it
or
at
least
some
characteristic
marks
in
the
first
place
religion
essentially
deals
with
the
uncharted
region
of
human
experience
a
large
part
of
human
life
has
been
thoroughly
surveyed
and
explored
we
understand
the
causes
at
work
and
we
are
not
bewildered
by
the
problems
that
is
the
domain
of
positive
knowledge
but
all
round
us
on
every
side
there
is
an
uncharted
region
just
fragments
of
the
fringe
of
it
explored
and
those
imperfectly
it
is
with
this
that
religion
deals
and
secondly
we
may
note
that
religion
deals
with
its
own
province
not
tentatively
by
the
normal
methods
of
patient
intellectual
research
but
directly
and
by
methods
of
emotion
or
apprehension
agriculture
for
instance
used
to
be
entirely
a
question
of
religion
now
it
is
almost
entirely
a
question
of
science
in
antiquity
if
a
field
was
barren
the
owner
of
it
would
probably
assume
that
the
barrenness
was
due
to
or
offence
somewhere
he
would
run
through
all
his
own
possible
offences
or
at
any
rate
those
of
his
neighbours
and
ancestors
and
when
he
eventually
decided
the
cause
of
the
trouble
the
steps
that
he
would
take
would
all
be
of
a
kind
calculated
not
to
affect
the
chemical
constitution
of
the
soil
but
to
satisfy
his
own
emotions
of
guilt
and
terror
or
the
imaginary
emotions
of
the
imaginary
being
he
had
offended
a
modern
man
in
the
same
predicament
would
probably
not
think
of
religion
at
all
at
any
rate
in
the
earlier
stages
he
would
say
it
was
a
case
for
deeper
ploughing
or
for
basic
slag
later
on
if
disaster
followed
disaster
till
he
began
to
feel
himself
a
marked
man
even
the
average
modern
would
i
think
begin
instinctively
to
reflect
upon
his
sins
a
third
characteristic
flows
from
the
first
the
uncharted
region
surrounds
us
on
every
side
and
is
apparently
infinite
consequently
when
once
the
things
of
the
uncharted
region
are
admitted
as
factors
in
our
ordinary
conduct
of
life
they
are
apt
to
be
infinite
factors
overruling
and
swamping
all
others
the
thing
that
religion
forbids
is
a
thing
never
to
be
done
not
all
the
inducements
that
this
life
can
offer
weigh
at
all
in
the
balance
indeed
there
is
no
balance
the
man
who
makes
terms
with
his
conscience
is
essentially
the
religious
man
knows
that
it
will
profit
him
nothing
if
he
gain
all
this
finite
world
and
lose
his
stake
in
the
infinite
and
eternal
am
i
going
to
draw
no
distinction
then
between
religion
and
mere
superstition
not
at
present
later
on
we
may
perhaps
see
some
way
to
it
superstition
is
the
name
given
to
a
low
or
bad
form
of
religion
to
the
kind
of
religion
we
disapprove
the
line
of
division
if
we
made
one
would
be
only
an
arbitrary
bar
thrust
across
a
highly
complex
and
continuous
process
does
this
amount
to
an
implication
that
all
the
religions
that
have
existed
in
the
world
are
false
not
so
it
is
obvious
indeed
that
most
if
analysed
into
intellectual
beliefs
are
false
and
i
suppose
that
a
thoroughly
orthodox
member
of
any
one
of
the
million
religious
bodies
that
exist
in
the
world
must
be
clear
in
his
mind
that
the
other
million
minus
one
are
wrong
if
not
wickedly
wrong
that
i
think
we
must
be
clear
about
yet
the
fact
remains
that
man
must
have
some
relation
towards
the
uncharted
the
mysterious
tracts
of
life
which
surround
him
on
every
side
and
for
my
own
part
i
am
content
to
say
that
his
method
must
be
to
a
large
extent
very
much
what
paul
calls
Ïá½·ÏÏÎ¹Ï
or
faith
that
is
some
attitude
not
of
the
conscious
intellect
but
of
the
whole
being
using
all
its
powers
of
sensitiveness
all
its
feeblest
and
most
inarticulate
feelers
and
tentacles
in
the
effort
somehow
to
touch
by
these
that
which
can
not
be
grasped
by
the
definite
senses
or
analysed
by
the
conscious
reason
what
we
gain
thus
is
an
insecure
but
a
precious
possession
we
gain
no
dogma
at
least
no
safe
dogma
but
we
gain
much
more
we
gain
something
hard
to
define
which
lies
at
the
heart
not
only
of
religion
but
of
art
and
poetry
and
all
the
higher
strivings
of
human
emotion
i
believe
that
at
times
we
actually
gain
practical
guidance
in
some
questions
where
experience
and
argument
fail
that
is
a
great
work
left
for
religion
but
we
must
always
remember
two
things
about
it
first
that
the
liability
to
error
is
enormous
indeed
almost
infinite
and
second
that
the
results
of
confident
error
are
very
terrible
probably
throughout
history
the
worst
things
ever
done
in
the
world
on
a
large
scale
by
decent
people
have
been
done
in
the
name
of
religion
and
i
do
not
think
that
has
entirely
ceased
to
be
true
at
the
present
day
all
the
middle
ages
held
the
strange
and
to
our
judgement
the
obviously
insane
belief
that
the
normal
result
of
religious
error
was
eternal
punishment
and
yet
by
the
crimes
to
which
that
false
belief
led
them
they
almost
proved
the
truth
of
something
very
like
it
the
record
of
early
christian
and
medieval
persecutions
which
were
the
direct
result
of
that
one
confident
religious
error
comes
curiously
near
to
one
conception
of
the
wickedness
of
the
damned
to
turn
to
our
immediate
subject
i
wish
to
put
forward
here
what
is
still
a
rather
new
and
unauthorized
view
of
the
development
of
greek
religion
readers
will
forgive
me
if
in
treating
so
vast
a
subject
i
draw
my
outline
very
broadly
leaving
out
many
qualifications
and
quoting
only
a
fragment
of
the
evidence
the
things
that
have
misled
us
moderns
in
our
efforts
towards
understanding
the
primitive
stage
in
greek
religion
have
been
first
the
widespread
and
almost
ineradicable
error
of
treating
homer
as
primitive
and
more
generally
our
unconscious
insistence
on
starting
with
the
notion
of
hartland
in
his
address
as
president
of
one
of
the
sections
of
the
international
congress
of
religions
at
oxford
dwelt
on
the
significant
fact
about
savage
religions
that
wherever
the
word
is
used
our
trustiest
witnesses
tend
to
contradict
one
another
among
the
best
observers
of
the
arunta
tribes
for
instance
some
hold
that
they
have
no
conception
of
god
others
that
they
are
constantly
thinking
about
god
the
truth
is
that
this
idea
of
a
god
far
away
in
the
sky
i
do
not
say
merely
a
first
cause
who
is
body
parts
or
passions
but
almost
any
being
that
we
should
naturally
call
a
is
an
idea
not
easy
for
primitive
man
to
grasp
it
is
a
subtle
and
rarefied
idea
saturated
with
ages
of
philosophy
and
speculation
and
we
must
always
remember
that
one
of
the
chief
religions
of
the
world
buddhism
has
risen
to
great
moral
and
intellectual
heights
without
using
the
conception
of
god
at
all
in
his
stead
it
has
dharma
the
eternal
law
apart
from
some
few
philosophers
both
christian
and
moslem
the
gods
of
the
ordinary
man
have
as
a
rule
been
as
a
matter
of
course
anthropomorphic
men
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
try
to
conceive
them
otherwise
in
many
cases
they
have
had
the
actual
bodily
shape
of
man
in
almost
all
they
have
possessed
of
course
in
their
highest
development
his
mind
and
reason
and
his
mental
attributes
it
causes
most
of
us
even
now
something
of
a
shock
to
be
told
by
a
medieval
arab
philosopher
that
to
call
god
benevolent
or
righteous
or
to
predicate
of
him
any
other
human
quality
is
just
as
pagan
and
degraded
as
to
say
that
he
has
a
beard
now
the
greek
gods
seem
at
first
sight
quite
particularly
solid
and
anthropomorphic
the
statues
and
vases
speak
clearly
and
they
are
mostly
borne
out
by
the
literature
of
course
we
must
discount
the
kind
of
evidence
that
misled
winckelmann
the
mere
roman
and
alexandrian
art
and
mythology
but
even
if
we
go
back
to
the
fifth
century
we
shall
find
the
ruling
conceptions
far
nobler
indeed
but
still
anthropomorphic
we
find
firmly
established
the
olympian
patriarchal
family
zeus
the
father
of
gods
and
men
his
wife
hera
his
son
apollo
his
daughter
athena
his
brothers
poseidon
and
hades
and
the
rest
we
probably
think
of
each
figure
more
or
less
as
like
a
statue
a
habit
of
mind
obviously
wrong
and
indeed
absurd
as
if
one
thought
of
and
as
statues
because
rodin
or
gaudens
has
so
represented
them
and
yet
it
was
a
habit
into
which
the
late
greeks
themselves
sometimes
fell
their
arts
of
sculpture
and
painting
as
applied
to
religion
had
been
so
dangerously
successful
they
sharpened
and
made
vivid
an
anthropomorphism
which
in
its
origin
had
been
mostly
the
result
of
normal
human
laziness
the
process
of
making
winds
and
rivers
into
anthropomorphic
gods
is
for
the
most
part
not
the
result
of
using
the
imagination
with
special
vigour
it
is
the
result
of
not
doing
so
the
wind
is
obviously
alive
any
fool
can
see
that
being
alive
it
blows
how
why
naturally
just
as
you
and
i
blow
it
knocks
things
down
it
shouts
and
dances
it
whispers
and
talks
and
unless
we
are
going
to
make
a
great
effort
of
the
imagination
and
try
to
realize
like
a
scientific
man
just
what
really
happens
we
naturally
assume
that
it
does
these
things
in
the
normal
way
in
the
only
way
we
know
even
when
you
worship
a
beast
or
a
stone
you
practically
anthropomorphize
it
it
happens
indeed
to
have
a
perfectly
clear
shape
so
you
accept
that
but
it
talks
acts
and
fights
just
like
a
man
as
you
can
see
from
the
folk
published
by
langloh
parker
because
you
do
not
take
the
trouble
to
think
out
any
other
way
of
behaving
this
kind
of
anthropomorphism
or
as
gladstone
used
to
call
it
of
is
primitive
and
inevitable
the
statue
type
of
god
is
different
and
is
due
in
greece
directly
to
the
work
of
the
artists
we
must
get
back
behind
these
gods
of
the
artist
workshop
and
the
imagination
and
see
if
the
religious
thinkers
of
the
great
period
use
or
imply
the
same
highly
human
conceptions
we
shall
find
parmenides
telling
us
that
god
coincides
with
the
universe
which
is
a
sphere
and
immovable
heraclitus
that
god
is
night
summer
winter
war
peace
satiety
hunger
xenophanes
that
god
is
and
all
mind
and
as
for
his
supposed
human
shape
why
if
bulls
and
lions
were
to
speak
about
god
they
would
doubtless
tell
us
that
he
was
a
bull
or
a
lion
we
must
notice
the
instinctive
language
of
the
poets
using
the
word
Î¸Îµá½¹Ï
in
many
subtle
senses
for
which
our
word
is
too

too
anthropomorphic

thrill
of
recognizing
a
after
long

is
a

is
a
whose

is
poured
out
in
libation
to
gods
and
in
the
unwritten
law
of
the
human
conscience
great
god
liveth
and
groweth
not
old
you
will
say
that
is
mere
poetry
or
philosophy
it
represents
a
particular
theory
or
a
particular
metaphor
i
think
not
language
of
this
sort
is
used
widely
and
without
any
explanation
or
apology
it
was
evidently
understood
and
felt
to
be
natural
by
the
audience
if
it
is
metaphorical
all
metaphors
have
grown
from
the
soil
of
current
thought
and
normal
experience
and
without
going
into
the
point
at
length
i
think
we
may
safely
conclude
that
the
soil
from
which
such
language
as
this
grew
was
not
any
system
of
personal
anthropomorphic
theology
no
doubt
any
of
these
poets
if
he
had
to
make
a
picture
of
one
of
these
utterly
formless
gods
would
have
given
him
a
human
form
that
was
the
recognized
symbol
as
a
veiled
woman
is
gaudens
symbol
for
but
we
have
other
evidence
too
which
shows
abundantly
that
these
olympian
gods
are
not
primary
but
are
imposed
upon
a
background
strangely
unlike
themselves
for
a
long
time
their
luminous
figures
dazzled
our
eyes
we
were
not
able
to
see
the
regions
behind
them
the
dark
primeval
tangle
of
desires
and
fears
and
dreams
from
which
they
drew
their
vitality
the
surest
test
to
apply
in
this
question
is
the
evidence
of
actual
cult
miss
harrison
has
here
shown
us
the
right
method
and
following
her
we
will
begin
with
the
three
great
festivals
of
athens
the
diasia
the
thesmophoria
and
the
anthesteria
the
diasia
was
said
to
be
the
chief
festival
of
zeus
the
central
figure
of
the
olympians
though
our
authorities
generally
add
an
epithet
to
him
and
call
him
zeus
meilichios
zeus
of
placation
a
god
with
an
is
always
suspicious
like
a
human
being
with
an
miss
harrison
examination
pp
ff
shows
that
in
the
rites
zeus
has
no
place
at
all
meilichios
from
the
beginning
has
a
fairly
secure
one
on
some
of
the
reliefs
meilichios
appears
not
as
a
god
but
as
an
enormous
bearded
snake
a
representation
of
underworld
powers
or
dead
ancestors
sometimes
the
great
snake
is
alone
sometimes
he
rises
gigantic
above
the
small
human
worshippers
approaching
him
and
then
in
certain
reliefs
his
old
barbaric
presence
vanishes
and
we
have
instead
a
benevolent
and
human
father
of
gods
and
men
trying
as
miss
harrison
somewhere
expresses
it
to
look
as
if
he
had
been
there
all
the
time
there
was
a
sacrifice
at
the
diasia
but
it
was
not
a
sacrifice
given
to
zeus
to
zeus
and
all
the
heavenly
gods
men
gave
sacrifice
in
the
form
of
a
feast
in
which
the
god
had
his
portion
and
the
worshippers
theirs
the
two
parties
cemented
their
friendship
and
feasted
happily
together
but
the
sacrifice
at
the
diasia
was
a
holocaust
every
shred
of
the
victim
was
burnt
to
ashes
that
no
man
might
partake
of
it
we
know
quite
well
the
meaning
of
that
form
of
sacrifice
it
is
a
sacrifice
to
placate
or
appease
the
powers
below
the
chthonioi
the
dead
and
the
lords
of
death
it
was
performed
as
our
authorities
tell
us
Î¼ÎµÏá½°
ÏÏÏÎ³Î½á½¹ÏÎ·ÏÎ¿Ï
with
shuddering
or
repulsion
the
diasia
was
a
ritual
of
placation
that
is
of
casting
away
various
elements
of
pollution
or
danger
and
appeasing
the
unknown
wraths
of
the
surrounding
darkness
the
nearest
approach
to
a
god
contained
in
this
festival
is
meilichios
and
meilichios
as
we
shall
see
later
belongs
to
a
particular
class
of
shadowy
beings
who
are
built
up
out
of
ritual
services
his
name
means
of
and
he
is
nothing
else
he
is
merely
the
personified
shadow
or
dream
generated
by
the
emotion
of
the
ritual
very
much
to
take
a
familiar
instance
as
father
christmas
is
a
of
our
christmas
customs
the
thesmophoria
formed
the
great
festival
of
demeter
and
her
daughter
korÃª
though
here
again
demeter
appears
with
a
clinging
epithet
thesmophoros
we
know
pretty
clearly
the
whole
course
of
the
ritual
there
is
the
carrying
by
women
of
certain
magic
charms
and
snakes
and
unnameable
objects
made
of
paste
to
ensure
fertility
there
is
a
sacrifice
of
pigs
who
were
thrown
into
a
deep
cleft
of
the
earth
and
their
remains
afterwards
collected
and
scattered
as
a
charm
over
the
fields
there
is
more
magic
ritual
more
carrying
of
sacred
objects
a
fast
followed
by
a
rejoicing
a
disappearance
of
life
below
the
earth
and
a
rising
again
of
life
above
it
but
it
is
hard
to
find
definite
traces
of
any
personal
goddess
the
olympian
demeter
and
persephone
dwindle
away
as
we
look
closer
and
we
are
left
with
the
shadow
thesmophoros
who
carries
not
a
substantive
personal
goddess
but
merely
a
personification
of
the
ritual
itself
an
imaginary
generated
by
so
much
just
as
meilichios
in
the
diasia
was
generated
from
the
ritual
of
appeasement
now
the
diasia
were
dominated
by
a
sacred
snake
is
there
any
similar
divine
animal
in
the
thesmophoria
alas
yes
both
here
and
still
more
markedly
in
the
mysteries
of
demeter
and
persephone
at
eleusis
we
regularly
find
the
most
lovely
of
all
goddesses
demeter
and
persephone
habitually
i
will
not
say
represented
by
but
dangerously
associated
with
a
sacred
sow
a
pig
is
the
one
animal
in
greek
religion
that
actually
had
sacrifice
made
to
it
the
third
feast
the
anthesteria
belongs
in
classical
times
to
the
olympian
dionysus
and
is
said
to
be
the
oldest
of
his
feasts
on
the
surface
there
is
a
touch
of
the
and
he
is
given
due
official
prominence
but
as
soon
as
we
penetrate
anywhere
near
the
heart
of
the
festival
dionysus
and
his
brother
gods
are
quite
forgotten
and
all
that
remains
is
a
great
ritual
for
appeasing
the
dead
all
the
days
of
the
feast
were
of
ill
omen
the
first
day
especially
was
á¼Ï
Ïá½¸
Ïá¾¶Î½
á¼ÏÎ¿ÏÏá½±Ï
on
it
the
wine
jars
which
were
also
seed
and
funeral
jars
were
opened
and
the
spirits
of
the
dead
let
loose
in
the
world
nameless
and
innumerable
the
ghosts
are
summoned
out
of
their
tombs
and
are
duly
feasted
each
man
summoning
his
own
ghosts
to
his
own
house
and
carefully
abstaining
from
any
act
that
would
affect
his
neighbours
and
then
when
they
are
properly
appeased
and
made
gentle
they
are
swept
back
again
out
of
this
world
to
the
place
where
they
properly
belong
and
the
streets
and
houses
cleaned
from
the
presence
of
death
there
is
one
central
stage
indeed
in
which
dionysus
does
seem
to
appear
and
he
appears
in
a
very
significant
way
to
conduct
a
sacred
marriage
for
why
do
you
suppose
the
dead
are
summoned
at
all
what
use
to
the
tribe
is
the
presence
of
all
these
dead
ancestors
they
have
come
i
suspect
to
be
born
again
to
begin
a
new
life
at
the
great
spring
festival
for
the
new
births
of
the
tribe
the
new
crops
the
new
kids
the
new
human
beings
are
of
course
really
only
the
old
ones
returned
to
earth
the
important
thing
is
to
get
them
properly
placated
and
purified
free
from
the
contagion
of
ancient
sin
or
underworld
anger
for
nothing
is
so
dangerous
as
the
presence
of
what
i
may
call
raw
ghosts
the
anthesteria
contained
like
other
feasts
of
the
kind
a
á¼±ÎµÏá½¸Ï
Î³á½±Î¼Î¿Ï
or
holy
marriage
between
the
wife
of
the
basileus
or
sacred
king
and
the
imaginary
god
whatever
reality
there
ever
was
in
the
ceremony
has
apparently
by
classical
times
faded
away
but
the
place
where
the
god
received
his
bride
is
curious
it
was
called
the
boukolion
or
bull
shed
it
was
not
originally
the
home
of
an
anthropomorphic
god
but
of
a
divine
animal
thus
in
each
of
these
great
festivals
we
find
that
the
olympian
gods
vanish
away
and
we
are
left
with
three
things
only
first
with
an
atmosphere
of
religious
dread
second
with
a
whole
sequence
of
magical
ceremonies
which
in
two
at
least
of
the
three
cases
produce
a
kind
of
strange
personal
emanation
of
themselves
the
appeasements
producing
meilichios
the
thesmophoros
and
thirdly
with
a
divine
or
sacred
animal
in
the
diasia
we
find
the
old
superhuman
snake
who
reappears
so
ubiquitously
throughout
greece
the
regular
symbol
of
the
underworld
powers
especially
the
hero
or
dead
ancestor
why
the
snake
was
so
chosen
we
can
only
surmise
he
obviously
lived
underground
his
home
was
among
the
chthonioi
the
also
says
the
scholiast
to
aristophanes
he
was
a
type
of
new
birth
because
he
throws
off
his
old
skin
and
renews
himself
and
if
that
in
itself
is
not
enough
to
show
his
supernatural
power
what
normal
earthly
being
could
send
his
enemies
to
death
by
one
little
as
some
snakes
can
in
the
thesmophoria
we
found
sacred
swine
and
the
reason
given
by
the
ancients
is
no
doubt
the
right
one
the
sow
is
sacred
because
of
its
fertility
and
possibly
as
practical
people
we
should
add
because
of
its
cheapness
swine
are
always
prominent
in
greek
agricultural
rites
and
the
bull
well
we
modern
have
almost
forgotten
what
a
real
bull
is
like
for
so
many
centuries
we
have
tamed
him
and
penned
him
in
and
utterly
deposed
him
from
his
place
as
lord
of
the
forest
the
bull
was
the
chief
of
magic
or
sacred
animals
in
greece
chief
because
of
his
enormous
strength
his
size
his
rage
in
fine
as
anthropologists
call
it
his
that
primitive
word
which
comprises
force
vitality
prestige
holiness
and
power
of
magic
and
which
may
belong
equally
to
a
lion
a
chief
a
or
a
now
in
the
art
and
the
handbooks
these
sacred
animals
have
all
been
adopted
into
the
olympian
system
they
appear
regularly
as
the
of
particular
gods
zeus
is
merely
accompanied
by
a
snake
an
eagle
a
bull
or
at
worst
assumes
for
his
private
purposes
the
forms
of
those
animals
the
cow
and
the
cuckoo
are
sacred
to
hera
the
owl
and
the
snake
to
athena
the
dolphin
the
crow
the
lizard
the
bull
to
apollo
dionysus
always
like
a
wilder
and
less
zeus
appears
freely
as
a
snake
bull
and
lion
allowing
for
some
isolated
exceptions
the
safest
rule
in
all
these
cases
is
that
the
attribute
is
original
and
the
god
is
added
it
comes
out
very
clearly
in
the
case
of
the
snake
and
the
bull
the
tremendous
of
the
wild
bull
indeed
occupies
almost
half
the
stage
of
ritual
the
religion
unearthed
by
evans
in
crete
is
permeated
by
the
bull
of
minos
the
heads
and
horns
are
in
almost
every
sacred
room
and
on
every
altar
the
great
religious
scene
depicted
on
the
sarcophagus
of
hagia
triada
centres
in
the
holy
blood
that
flows
from
the
neck
of
a
captive
and
dying
bull
down
into
classical
times
bull
blood
was
a
sacred
thing
which
it
was
dangerous
to
touch
and
death
to
taste
to
drink
a
cup
of
it
was
the
most
heroic
form
of
suicide
the
sacrificial
bull
at
delphi
was
called
he
was
not
merely
holy
he
was
the
sanctifier
he
who
maketh
holy
it
was
by
contact
with
him
that
holiness
was
spread
to
others
on
a
coin
and
a
vase
cited
by
miss
harrison
we
have
a
bull
entering
a
holy
cave
and
a
bull
standing
in
a
shrine
we
have
holy
pillars
whose
holiness
consists
in
the
fact
that
they
have
been
touched
with
the
blood
of
a
bull
we
have
a
long
record
of
a
at
magnesia
in
which
zeus
though
he
makes
a
kind
of
external
claim
to
be
lord
of
the
feast
dare
not
claim
that
the
bull
is
sacrificed
to
him
zeus
has
a
ram
to
himself
and
stands
apart
showing
but
a
weak
and
shadowy
figure
beside
the
original
holy
one
we
have
immense
masses
of
evidence
about
the
religion
of
mithras
at
one
time
the
most
serious
rival
of
christianity
which
sought
its
hope
and
its
salvation
in
the
blood
of
a
divine
bull
now
what
is
the
origin
of
this
conception
of
the
sacred
animal
it
was
first
discovered
and
explained
with
almost
prophetic
insight
by
robertson
smith
the
origin
is
what
he
calls
a
sacramental
feast
you
eat
the
flesh
and
drink
the
blood
of
the
divine
animal
in
order
here
i
diverge
from
robertson
smith
language
to
get
into
you
his
his
vital
power
the
classical
instance
is
the
sacramental
eating
of
a
camel
by
an
arab
tribe
recorded
in
the
works
of
st
nilus
the
camel
was
devoured
on
a
particular
day
at
the
rising
of
the
morning
star
he
was
cut
to
pieces
alive
and
every
fragment
of
him
had
to
be
consumed
before
the
sun
rose
if
the
life
had
once
gone
out
of
the
flesh
and
blood
the
sacrifice
would
have
been
spoilt
it
was
the
spirit
the
vitality
of
the
camel
that
his
tribesmen
wanted
the
only
serious
error
that
later
students
have
found
in
robertson
statement
is
that
he
spoke
too
definitely
of
the
sacrifice
as
affording
communion
with
the
tribal
god
there
was
no
god
there
only
the
raw
material
out
of
which
gods
are
made
you
devoured
the
holy
animal
to
get
its
its
swiftness
its
strength
its
great
endurance
just
as
the
savage
now
will
eat
his
enemy
brain
or
heart
or
hands
to
get
some
particular
quality
residing
there
the
imagination
of
the
tribes
was
evidently
dominated
above
all
things
by
the
bull
though
there
were
other
sacramental
feasts
too
combined
with
sundry
horrible
rendings
and
drinkings
of
raw
blood
it
is
strange
to
think
that
even
small
things
like
kids
and
fawns
and
hares
should
have
struck
primitive
man
as
having
some
uncanny
vitality
which
he
longed
for
or
at
least
some
uncanny
power
over
the
weather
or
the
crops
yet
to
him
it
no
doubt
appeared
obvious
frogs
for
instance
could
always
bring
rain
by
croaking
for
it
and
who
can
limit
the
powers
and
the
knowledge
of
birds
here
comes
a
difficulty
if
the
olympian
god
was
not
there
to
start
with
how
did
he
originate
we
can
understand
at
least
after
a
course
of
anthropology
this
desire
of
primitive
man
to
acquire
for
himself
the
superhuman
forces
of
the
bull
but
how
does
he
make
the
transition
from
the
real
animal
to
the
imaginary
human
god
first
let
us
remember
the
innate
tendency
of
primitive
man
everywhere
and
not
especially
in
greece
to
imagine
a
personal
cause
like
himself
in
all
points
not
otherwise
specified
for
every
striking
phenomenon
if
the
wind
blows
it
is
because
some
being
more
or
less
human
though
of
course
superhuman
is
blowing
with
his
cheeks
if
a
tree
is
struck
by
lightning
it
is
because
some
one
has
thrown
his
at
it
in
some
australian
tribes
there
is
no
belief
in
natural
death
if
a
man
dies
it
is
because
man
kill
that
fellow
paul
we
may
remember
passionately
summoned
the
heathen
to
refrain
from
worshipping
Ïá½´Î½
ÎºÏá½·ÏÎ¹Î½
the
creation
and
go
back
to
Ïá½¸Î½
ÎºÏá½·ÏÎ±Î½ÏÎ±
the
creator
human
and
masculine
it
was
as
a
rule
a
road
that
they
were
only
too
ready
to
travel
but
this
tendency
was
helped
by
a
second
factor
research
has
shown
us
the
existence
in
early
mediterranean
religion
of
a
peculiar
transitional
step
a
man
wearing
the
head
or
skin
of
a
holy
beast
the
egyptian
gods
are
depicted
as
men
with
beasts
heads
that
is
the
best
authorities
tell
us
their
shapes
are
derived
from
the
kings
and
priests
who
on
great
occasions
of
sacrifice
covered
their
heads
with
a
minos
with
his
projection
the
minotaur
was
a
and
wore
a
from
early
island
gems
from
a
fresco
at
mycenae
from
assyrian
reliefs
a
cook
has
collected
many
examples
of
this
mixed
figure
a
man
wearing
the
or
mask
and
mane
of
a
beast
sometimes
we
can
actually
see
him
offering
libations
sometimes
the
worshipper
has
become
so
closely
identified
with
his
divine
beast
that
he
is
represented
not
as
a
mere
man
wearing
the
of
a
lion
or
bull
but
actually
as
a
lion
or
bull
wearing
the
of
another
hera
Î²Î¿á¿¶ÏÎ¹Ï
with
a
cow
head
athena

and
covering
his

Î´ÎµÎ¹Î½á¿·
Ïá½±ÏÎ¼Î±ÏÎ¹
Î¸Î·Ïá½¹Ï
the
awful
spread
jaws
of
the
wild
beast
belong
to
the
same
class
so
does
the
dadouchos
at
eleusis
and
other
initiators
who
let
candidates
for
purification
set
one
foot
one
only
and
that

the
skin
of
a

ram

called

the
fleece
not
of
a
ram
but
of
zeus
the
of
the
slain
beast
is
in
the
hide
and
head
and
blood
and
fur
and
the
man
who
wants
to
be
in
thorough
contact
with
the
divinity
gets
inside
the
skin
and
wraps
himself
deep
in
it
he
begins
by
being
a
man
wearing
a
lion
skin
he
ends
as
we
have
seen
by
feeling
himself
to
be
a
lion
wearing
a
lion
skin
and
who
is
this
man
he
may
on
particular
occasions
be
only
a
candidate
for
purification
or
initiation
but
he
who
has
the
right
is
the
priest
the
the
divine
king
if
an
old
suggestion
of
my
own
is
right
he
is
the
original
Î¸Îµá½¹Ï
or
Î¸ÎµÏá½¹Ï
the
incarnate
medicine
or
spell
or
magic
power
he
at
first
i
suspect
is
the
only
Î¸Îµá½¹Ï
or
that
his
society
knows
we
commonly
speak
of
ancient
kings
being
we
regard
the
process
as
due
to
an
outburst
of
superstition
or
insane
flattery
and
so
no
doubt
it
sometimes
was
especially
in
later
times
when
man
and
god
were
felt
as
two
utterly
distinct
things
but
is
an
unintelligent
and
misleading
word
what
we
call
is
only
the
survival
of
this
undifferentiated
human
Î¸Îµá½¹Ï
with
his
his
ÎºÏá½±ÏÎ¿Ï
and
Î²á½·Î±
his
control
of
the
weather
the
rain
and
the
thunder
the
spring
crops
and
the
autumn
floods
his
knowledge
of
what
was
lawful
and
what
was
not
and
his
innate
power
to
curse
or
to
dead
recent
researches
have
shown
us
in
abundance
the
early
greek
making
thunder
and
lightning
and
rain
we
have
long
known
the
king
as
possessor
of
dike
and
themis
of
justice
and
tribal
custom
we
have
known
his
effect
on
the
fertility
of
the
fields
and
the
tribes
and
the
terrible
results
of
a
king
sin
or
a
king
sickness
what
is
the
subsequent
history
of
this
or
Î¸Îµá½¹Ï
he
is
differentiated
as
it
were
the
visible
part
of
him
becomes
merely
human
the
supposed
supernatural
part
grows
into
what
we
should
call
a
god
the
process
is
simple
any
particular
is
bound
to
have
his
failures
as
frazer
gently
reminds
us
every
single
pretension
which
he
puts
forth
on
every
day
of
his
life
is
a
lie
and
liable
sooner
or
later
to
be
found
out
doubtless
men
are
tender
to
their
own
delusions
they
do
not
at
once
condemn
the
as
a
fraudulent
institution
but
they
tend
gradually
to
say
that
he
is
not
the
real
Î¸Îµá½¹Ï
he
is
only
his
representative
the
real
Î¸Îµá½¹Ï
tremendous
infallible
is
somewhere
far
away
hidden
in
clouds
perhaps
on
the
summit
of
some
inaccessible
mountain
if
the
mountain
is
once
climbed
the
god
will
move
to
the
upper
sky
the
meanwhile
stays
on
earth
still
influential
he
has
some
connexion
with
the
great
god
more
intimate
than
that
of
other
men
at
worst
he
possesses
the
god
sacred
instruments
his
á¼±ÎµÏá½±
or
á½ÏÎ³Î¹Î±
he
knows
the
rules
for
approaching
him
and
making
prayers
to
him
there
is
therefore
a
path
open
from
the
divine
beast
to
the
anthropomorphic
god
from
beings
like
thesmophoros
and
meilichios
the
road
is
of
course
much
easier
they
are
already
more
than
half
anthropomorphic
they
only
lack
the
concreteness
the
lucid
shape
and
the
detailed
personal
history
of
the
olympians
in
this
connexion
we
must
not
forget
the
power
of
hallucination
still
fairly
strong
as
the
history
of
religious
revivals
in
america
will
bear
witness
but
far
stronger

among
the
impressionable
hordes
of
early

collective
desire
projected
as
it
were
or
personified
think
of
the
gods
who
have
appeared
in
great
crises
of
battle
created
sometimes
by
the
desperate
desire
of
men
who
have
for
years
prayed
to
them
and
who
are
now
at
the
last
extremity
for
lack
of
their
aid
sometimes
by
the
confused
and
excited
remembrances
of
the
survivors
after
the
victory
the
gods
who
led

figures
that
were

fighting
before

greeks
at

even
the
celestial
signs
that
promised
constantine
victory
for
the
cross
these
are
the
effects
of
great
emotion
we
can
all
understand
them
but
even
in
daily
life
primitive
men
seem
to
have
dealt
more
freely
than
we
generally
do
with
apparitions
and
voices
and
daemons
of
every
kind
one
of
the
most
remarkable
and
noteworthy
sources
for
this
kind
of
hallucinatory
god
in
early
societies
is
a
social
custom
that
we
have
almost
forgotten
the
religious
dance
when
the
initiated
young
men
of
crete
or
elsewhere
danced
at
night
over
the
mountains
in
the
oreibasia
or
mountain
walk
they
not
only
did
things
that
seemed
beyond
their
ordinary
workaday
strength
they
also
felt
themselves
led
on
and
on
by
some
power
which
guided
and
sustained
them
this
daemon
has
no
necessary
name
a
man
may
be
named
after
him
to
the
mountain
dancer
just
as
others
may
be
named
or
the
god
is
only
the
spirit
of
the
mountain
dance
oreibates
though
of
course
he
is
absorbed
at
different
times
in
various
olympians
there
is
one
god
called
aphiktor
the
suppliant
he
who
prays
for
mercy
he
is
just
the
projection
as
douttÃ©
would
say
of
the
intense
emotion
of
one
of
those
strange
processions
well
known
in
the
ancient
world
bands
of
despairing
men
or
women
who
have
thrown
away
all
means
of
and
join
together
at
some
holy
place
in
one
passionate
prayer
for
pity
the
highest
of
all
gods
zeus
was
the
special
patron
of
the
suppliant
and
it
is
strange
and
instructive
to
find
that
zeus
the
is
actually
identified
with
this
aphiktor

the
assembled

the
united
cry
that
rises
from
the
oppressed
of
the
world
is
itself
grown
to
be
a
god
and
the
greatest
god
a
similar
projection
arose
from
the
dance
of
the
or
initiate
youths
in
the
dithyramb
the
magic
dance
which
was
to
celebrate
or
more
properly
to
hasten
and
strengthen
the
coming
on
of
spring
that
dance
projected
the
megistos
kouros
the
greatest
of
youths
who
is
the
incarnation
of
spring
or
the
return
of
life
and
lies
at
the
back
of
so
many
of
the
most
gracious
shapes
of
the
classical
pantheon
the
kouros
appears
as
dionysus
as
apollo
as
hermes
as
ares
in
our
clearest
and
most
detailed
piece
of
evidence
he
actually
appears
with
the
characteristic
history
and
attributes
of
zeus
this
spirit
of
the
dance
who
leads
it
or
personifies
its
emotion
stands
more
clearly
perhaps
than
any
other
daemon
between
earth
and
heaven
a
number
of
difficult
passages
in
euripides
and
other
dionysiac
literature
find
their
explanations
when
we
realize
how
the
god
is
in
part
merely
identified
with
the
inspired
chief
dancer
in
part
he
is
the
intangible
projected
incarnation
of
the
emotion
of
the
dance
collective
desire
personified
on
what
does
the
collective
desire
or
collective
dread
of
the
primitive
community
chiefly
concentrate
on
two
things
the
and
the
the
desire
not
to
die
of
famine
and
not
to
be
harried
or
conquered
by
the
neighbouring
tribe
the
fertility
of
the
earth
and
the
fertility
of
the
tribe
these
two
are
felt
in
early
religion
as
one
the
earth
is
a
mother
the
human
mother
is
an
á¼ÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ±
or
ploughed
field
this
is
the
characteristic
and
central
feature
of
the
early
aegean
religions
the
introduction
of
agriculture
made
her
a
mother
of
fruits
and
corn
and
it
is
in
that
form
that
we
best
know
her
but
in
earlier
days
she
had
been
a
mother
of
the
spontaneous
growth
of
the
soil
of
wild
beasts
and
trees
and
all
the
life
of
the
mountain
in
early
crete
she
stands
with
lions
erect
on
either
side
of
her
or
with
snakes
held
in
her
hands
and
coiled
about
her
body
and
as
the
earth
is
mother
when
the
harvest
comes
so
in
spring
she
is
maiden
or
korÃª
but
a
maiden
fated
each
year
to
be
wedded
and
made
fruitful
and
earlier
still
there
has
been
the
terrible
time
when
fields
are
bare
and
lifeless
the
korÃª
has
been
snatched
away
underground
among
the
dead
peoples
and
men
must
wait
expectant
till
the
first
buds
begin
to
show
and
they
call
her
to
rise
again
with
the
flowers
meantime
earth
as
she
brings
forth
vegetation
in
spring
is
kourotrophos
rearer
of
kouroi
or
the
young
men
of
the
tribe
the
nymphs
and
rivers
are
all
kourotrophoi
the
moon
is
kourotrophos
she
quickens
the

in
their

womb
at
one
terrible
hour
especially
she
is
lion
to
women
who
have
offended
against
her
holiness
she
also
marks
the
seasons
of
sowing
and
ploughing
and
the
due
time
for
the
ripening
of
crops
when
men
learn
to
calculate
in
longer
units
the
sun
appears
they
turn
to
the
sun
for
their
calendar
and
at
all
times
of
course
the
sun
has
been
a
power
in
agriculture
he
is
not
called
kourotrophos
but
the
young
sun
returning
after
winter
is
himself
a
kouros
and
all
the
kouroi
have
some
touch

simply

the

gifts

is
best
shown
by
the
rites

tribal
initiation
which
seem
normally
to
have
formed
part

performances
the

we

are

á¼Î½Î´ÏÎµÏ
men
the
actual
name
kouros
is
possibly
connected
with
ÎºÎµá½·ÏÎµÎ¹Î½
to
shave
and
may
mean
that
after
this
ceremony
they
first
cut
their
long

then
the
ÎºÎ¿á¿¦ÏÎ¿Ï
is
á¼ÎºÎµÏÏÎµÎºá½¹Î¼Î·Ï

they

belong

á¼Î½Î´ÏÎµÏ
alone
they
have
the
work
of
begetting
children
for
the
tribe
and
the
work
of
killing
the
tribe
enemies
in
battle
the
classification
of
people
according
to
their
age
is
apt
to
be
sharp
and
vivid
in
primitive
communities
we
for
example
think
of
an
old
man
as
a
kind
of
man
and
an
old
woman
as
a
kind
of
woman
but
in
primitive
peoples
as
soon
as
a
man
and
woman
cease
to
be
able
to
perform
his
and
her
due
tribal
functions
they
cease
to
be
men

women

in

the
divisions
are
still
sharper

more
numerous
centring
in
the
great
initiation
ceremonies
of
the
iranes
or
youths
to
the
goddess
called
orthia
or
bortheia
these
initiation
ceremonies
are
called
teletai
they
mark
the
great
of
transition
from
the
immature
charming
but
half
useless
thing
which
we
call
boy
or
girl
to
the
Ïá½³Î»ÎµÎ¹Î¿Ï
á¼Î½á½µÏ
the
full

of

as
fighter
or
counsellor
or
to
the
ÏÎµÎ»Îµá½·Î±
Î³ÏÎ½á½µ
the
full

this
whole
subject
of
greek
initiation
ceremonies
calls
pressingly
for
more
investigation
it
is
only
in
the
last
few
years
that
we
have
obtained
the
material
for
understanding
them
and
the
whole
mass
of
the
evidence
needs
for
one
instance
it
is
clear
that
a
great
number
of
rites
which
were
formerly
explained
as
remnants
of
human
sacrifice
are
simply
ceremonies
of
initiation
at
the
great
spring
drÃ´menon
the
tribe
and
the
growing
earth
were
renovated
together
the
earth
arises
afresh
from
her
dead
seeds
the
tribe
from
its
dead
ancestors
and
the
whole
process
charged
as
it
is
with
the
emotion
of
pressing
human
desire
projects
its
anthropomorphic
god
or
daemon
a
we
call
him
very
inadequately
he
is
a
divine
kouros
a
a
spirit
that
in

old

we
observed
that
in
all
the
three
festivals
there
was
a
pervasive
element
of
vague
fear
hitherto
we
have
been
dealing
with
early
greek
religion
chiefly
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
positive
power
or
force
that
man
tries
to
acquire
from
his
or
his
god
but
there
is
also
a
negative
side
to
be
considered
there
is
not
only
the
but
the
the
forbidden
the
thing
feared
we
must
cast
away
the
old

we
must
put
our
sins
on
to
a

or
scapegoat
and
drive
it
out
when
the
ghosts
have
returned
and
feasted
with
us
at
the
anthesteria
we
must
with
tar
and
branches
of
buckthorn
purge
them
out
of
every
corner
of
the
rooms
till
the
air
is
pure
from
the
infection
of
death
we
must
avoid
speaking
dangerous
words
in
great
moments
we
must
avoid
speaking
any
words
at
all
lest
there
should
be
even
in
the
most
innocent
of
them
some
unknown
danger
for
we
are
surrounded
above
and
below
by
kÃªres
or
spirits
winged
influences
shapeless
or
of
unknown
shape
sometimes
the
spirits
of
death
sometimes
of
disease
madness
calamity
thousands
and
thousands
of
them
as
sarpedon
says
from
whom
man
can
never
escape
nor
hide
the
air
so
crowded
with
them
says
an
unknown
ancient
poet
there
is
not
one
empty
chink
into
which
you
could
push
the
spike
of
a
blade
of
corn
the
extraordinary
security
of
our
modern
life
in
times
of
peace
makes
it
hard
for
us
to
realize
except
by
a
definite
effort
of
the
imagination
the
constant
precariousness
the
frightful
proximity
of
death
that
was
usual
in
these
weak
ancient
communities
they
were
in
fear
of
wild
beasts
they
were
helpless
against
floods
helpless
against
pestilences
their
food
depended
on
the
crops
of
one
tiny
plot
of
ground
and
if
the
saviour
was
not
reborn
with
the
spring
they
slowly
and
miserably
died
and
all
the
while
they
knew
almost
nothing
of
the
real
causes
that
made
crops
succeed
or
fail
they
only
felt
sure
it
was
somehow
a
matter
of
pollution
of
unexpiated
defilement
it
is
this
state
of
things
that
explains
the
curious
cruelty
of
early
agricultural
doings
the
human
sacrifices
the
scapegoats
the
tearing
in
pieces
of
living
animals
and
perhaps
of
living
men
the
steeping
of
the
fields
in
blood
like
most
cruelty
it
has
its
roots
in
terror
terror
of
the
breach
of
the
forbidden
thing
i
will
not
dwell
on
this
side
of
the
picture
it
is
well
enough
known
but
we
have
to
remember
that
like
so
many
morbid
growths
of
the
human
mind
it
has
its
sublime
side
we
must
not
forget
that
the
human
victims
were
often
volunteers
the
records
of
carthage
and
jerusalem
the
long
list
in
greek
legend
of
princes
and
princesses
who
died
for
their
country
tell
the
same
story
in
most
human
societies
savage
as
well
as
civilized
it
is
not
hard
to
find
men
who
are
ready
to
endure
death
for
their
we
need
not
suppose
that
the
martyrs
were
always
the
noblest
of
the
human
race
they
were
sometimes
mad
hysterical
or
megalomaniac
sometimes
reckless
and
desperate
sometimes
as
in
the
curious
case
attested
of
the
roman
armies
on
the
danube
they
were
men
of
strong
desires
and
weak
imagination
ready
to
die
at
the
end
of
a
short
period
if
in
the
meantime
they
might
glut
all
their
senses
with
unlimited
indulgence
still
when
all
is
said
there
is
nothing
that
stirs
men
imagination
like
the
contemplation
of
martyrdom
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
more
emotional
cults
of
antiquity
vibrate
with
the
worship
of
this
dying
saviour
the
sÃ´sipolis
the
sÃ´tÃªr
who
in
so
many
forms
dies
with
his
world
or
for
his
world
and
rises
again
as
the
world
rises
triumphant
through
suffering
over
death
and
the
broken
is
at
first
sight
a
far
more
prominent
element
in
the
primitive
religions
than
just
as
misfortune
and
crime
are
more
highly
coloured
and
striking
than
prosperity
and
decent
behaviour
to
an
early
greek
tribe
the
world
of
possible
action
was
sharply
divided
between
what
was
themis
and
what
was
not
themis
between
lawful
and
holy
and
unholy
correct
and
forbidden
to
do
a
thing
that
was
not
themis
was
a
sure
source
of
public
disaster
consequently
it
was
of
the
first
necessity
in
a
life
full
of
such
perils
to
find
out
the
exact
rules
about
them
how
is
that
to
be
managed
themis
is
ancient
law
it
is

that
has
always
been
done
and
is
therefore
divinely
right

course

is
clear
every
one
knows
it

from
time
to
time
new
emergencies
arise

which
we

never

and
they
frighten
us
we
must
go

of
the

will
perhaps

by

may

he

come
to
a
famous

peculiar
greek

i

quoted
any

any

explanation
if
the

we

our

means
both
lend

and
give

two
ways
of
helping
people
in
an
emergency
sometimes
a
tribe
might
happen
to
have
a
real
ancestor
buried
in
the
neighbourhood
if
so
his
tomb
would
be
an
oracle
more
often
perhaps
for
the
memories
of
savage
tribes
are
very
precarious
there
would
be
no
personal
tomb
the
oracle
would
be
at
some
place
sacred
to
the
chthonian
people
in
general
or
to
some
particular
personification
of
them
a
delphi
or
a
cave
of
trophÃ´nius
a
place
of
snakes
and
earth
you
go
to
the
chthonian
folk
for
guidance
because
they
are
themselves
the
oldest
of
the
old
ones
and
they
know
the
real
custom
they
know
what
is
presbiston
what
is
themis
and
by
an
easy
extension
of
this
knowledge
they
are
also
supposed
to
know
what
is
he
who
knows
the
law
fully
to
the
uttermost
also
knows
what
will
happen
if
the
law
is
broken
it
is
i
think
important
to
realize
that
the
normal
reason
for
consulting
an
oracle
was
not
to
ask
questions
of
fact
it
was
that
some
emergency
had
arisen
in
which
men
simply
wanted
to
know
how
they
ought
to
behave
the
advice
they
received
in
this
way
varied
from
the
virtuous
to
the
abominable
as
the
religion
itself
varied
a
great
mass
of
oracles
can
be
quoted
enjoining
the
rules
of
customary
morality
justice
honesty
piety
duty
to
a
man
parents
to
the
old
and
to
the
weak
but
of
necessity
the
oracles
hated
change
and
strangled
the
progress
of
knowledge
also
like
most
manifestations
of
early
religion
they
throve
upon
human
terror
the
more
blind
the
terror
the
stronger
became
their
hold
in
such
an
atmosphere
the
lowest
and
most
beastlike
elements
of
humanity
tended
to
come
to
the
front
and
religion
no
doubt
as
a
rule
joined
with
them
in
drowning
the
voice
of
criticism
and
of
civilization
that
is
of
reason
and
of
mercy
when
really
frightened
the
oracle
generally
fell
back
on
some
remedy
full
of
pain
and
blood
the
medieval
plan
of
burning
heretics
alive
had
not
yet
been
invented
but
the
history
of
uncivilized
man
if
it
were
written
would
provide
a
vast
list
of
victims
all
of
them
innocent
who
died
or
suffered
to
expiate
some
portent
or
some
reported
Ïá½³ÏÎ±Ï
with
which
they
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
which
was
in
no
way
altered
by
their
suffering
which
probably
never
really
happened
at
all
and
if
it
did
was
of
no
consequence
the
sins
of
the
modern
world
in
dealing
with
heretics
and
witches
have
perhaps
been
more
gigantic
than
those
of
primitive
men
but
one
can
hardy
rise
from
the
record
of
these
ancient
observances
without
being
haunted
by
the
judgement
of
the
roman
poet
tantum

potuit
suadere
malorum
and
feeling
with
him
that
the
lightening
of
this
cloud
the
taming
of

blind
dragon
must
rank
among
the
very
greatest
services
that
hellenism
wrought
for
mankind
footnotes
professor
Ã©mile
durkheim
in
his
famous
analysis
of
the
religious
emotions
argues
that
when
a
man
feels
the
belief
and
the
command
as
something
coming
from
without
superior
authoritative
of
infinite
import
it
is
because
religion
is
the
work
of
the
tribe
and
as
such
superior
to
the
individual
the
voice
of
god
is
the
imagined
voice
of
the
whole
tribe
heard
or
imagined
by
him
who
is
going
to
break
its
laws
i
have
some
difficulty
about
the
psychology
implied
in
this
doctrine
surely
the
apparent
externality
of
the
religious
command
seems
to
belong
to
a
fairly
common
type
of
experience
in
which
the
personality
is
divided
so
that
first
one
part
of
it
and
then
another
emerges
into
consciousness
if
you
forget
an
engagement
sometimes
your
peace
is
disturbed
for
quite
a
long
time
by
a
vague
external
annoyance
or
condemnation
which
at
last
grows
to
be
a
distinct
judgement
i
ought
to
be
at
the
committee
on
but
apart
from
this
criticism
there
is
obviously
much
historical
truth
in

durkheim
theory
and
it
is
not
so
different
as
it
seems
at
first
sight
from
the
ordinary
beliefs
of
religious
men
the
tribe
to
primitive
man
is
not
a
mere
group
of
human
beings
it
is
his
whole
world
the
savage
who
is
breaking
the
laws
of
his
tribe
has
all
his
world
totems
tabus
earth
sky
and
all
against
him
he
can
not
be
at
peace

the
position
of
the
hero
or
martyr
who
defies
his
tribe
for
the
sake
of
what
he
thinks
the
truth
or
the
right
can
easily
be
thought
out
on
these
lines
he
defies

and
i
suspect
that
most
reforms
pass
through
this
stage
a
man
somehow
feels
clear
that
some
new
course
is
for
him
right
though
he
can
not
marshal
the
arguments
convincingly
in
favour
of
it
and
may
even
admit
that
the
weight
of
obvious
evidence
is
on
the
other
side
we
read
of
judges
in
the
seventeenth
century
who
believed
that
witches
ought
to
be
burned
and
that
the
persons
before
them
were
witches
and
yet
would
not
burn
them
evidently
under
the
influence
of
vague
feelings
i
know
a
vegetarian
who
thinks
that
as
far
as
he
can
see
carnivorous
habits
are
not
bad
for
human
health
and
actually
tend
to
increase
the
happiness
of
the
species
of
animals
eaten
as
the
adoption
of
swift
would
doubtless
relieve
the
economic
troubles
of
the
human
race

yet
feels
clear
that
for
him
the
ordinary
flesh
meal
or
on
corpses
would
of
the
nature
of
sin

path
of
progress

paved

inconsistencies

be
an
error

of
the
the
historian
of
early
greece
must
find
himself
often
on
the
watch
for
a
particular
cardinal
moment
generally
impossible
to
date
in
time
and
sometimes
hard
even
to
define
in
terms
of
development
when
the
clear
outline
that
we
call
classical
greece
begins
to
take
shape
out
of
the
mist
it
is
the
moment
when
as
herodotus
puts
it
hellenic
race
was
marked
off
from
the
barbarian
as
more
intelligent
and
more
emancipated
from
silly
nonsense
in
the
eighth
century
for
instance
so
far
as
our
remains
indicate
there
can
not
have
been
much
to
show
that
the
inhabitants
of
attica
and
boeotia
and
the
peloponnese
were
markedly
superior
to
those
of
say
lycia
or
phrygia
or
even
epirus
by
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
the
difference
is
enormous
on
the
one
side
is
hellas
on
the
other
the
motley
tribes
of
when
the
change
does
come
and
is
consciously
felt
we
may
notice
a
significant
fact
about
it
it
does
not
announce
itself
as
what
it
was
a
new
thing
in
the
world
it
professes
to
be
a
revival
or
rather
an
emphatic
realization
of
something
very
old
the
new
spirit
of
classical
greece
with
all
its
humanity
its
intellectual
life
its
genius
for
poetry
and
art
describes
itself
merely
as
being
like
the
hellenes
and
the
hellenes
were
simply
as
far
as
we
can
make
out
much
the
same
as
the
achaioi
one
of
the
many
tribes
of
predatory
northmen
who
had
swept
down
on
the
aegean
kingdoms
in
the
dawn
of
greek
history
this
claim
of
a
new
thing
to
be
old
is
in
varying
degrees
a
common
characteristic
of
great
movements
the
reformation
professed
to
be
a
return
to
the
bible
the
evangelical
movement
in
england
a
return
to
the
gospels
the
high
church
movement
a
return
to
the
early
church
a
large
element
even
in
the
french
revolution
the
greatest
of
all
breaches
with
the
past
had
for
its
ideal
a
return
to
roman
republican
virtue
or
to
the
simplicity
of
the
natural
man
i
noticed
quite
lately
a
speech
of
an
american
progressive
leader
claiming
that
his
principles
were
simply
those
of
abraham
lincoln
the
tendency
is
due
in
part
to
the
almost
insuperable
difficulty
of
really
inventing
a
new
word
to
denote
a
new
thing
it
is
so
much
easier
to
take
an
existing
word
especially
a
famous
word
with
fine
associations
and
twist
it
into
a
new
sense
in
part
no
doubt
it
comes
from
mankind
natural
love
for
these
old
associations
and
the
fact
that
nearly
all
people
who
are
worth
much
have
in
them
some
instinctive
spirit
of
reverence
even
when
striking
out
a
new
path
they
like
to
feel
that
they
are
following
at
least
the
spirit
of
one
greater
than
themselves
the
hellenism
of
the
sixth
and
fifth
centuries
was
to
a
great
extent
what
the
hellenism
of
later
ages
was
almost
entirely
an
ideal
and
a
standard
of
culture
the
classical
greeks
were
not
strictly
speaking
pure
hellenes
by
blood
herodotus
and
thucydides
are
quite
clear
about
that
the
original
hellenes
were
a
particular
conquering
tribe
of
great
prestige
which
attracted
the
surrounding
tribes
to
follow
it
imitate
it
and
call
themselves
by
its
name
the
spartans
were
to
herodotus
hellenic
the
athenians
on
the
other
hand
were
not
they
were
pelasgian
but
by
a
certain
time
into
hellenes
and
learnt
the
language
in
historical
times
we
can
not
really
find
any
tribe
of
pure
hellenes
in
existence
though
the
name
clings
faintly
to
a
particular
district
not
otherwise
important
in
south
thessaly
had
there
been
any
undoubted
hellenes
with
incontrovertible
pedigrees
still
going
very
likely
the
ideal
would
have
taken
quite
a
different
name
but
where
no
one
ancestry
would
bear
much
inspection
the
only
way
to
show
you
were
a
true
hellene
was
to
behave
as
such
that
is
to
approximate
to
some
constantly
rising
ideal
of
what
the
true
hellene
should
be
in
all
probability
if
a
greek
of
the
fifth
century
like
aeschylus
or
even
pindar
had
met
a
group
of
the
real
hellenes
or
achaioi
of
the
migrations
he
would
have
set
them
down
as
so
many
obvious
and
flaming
barbarians
we
do
not
know
whether
the
old
hellenes
had
any
general
word
to
denote
the
surrounding
peoples
and
divers
other
barbarous
tribes
whom
they
conquered
or
accepted
as
allies
in
any
case
by
the
time
of
the
persian
wars
say
all
these
tribes
together
considered
themselves
hellenized
bore
the
name
of
and
formed
a
kind
of
unity
against
hordes
of
surrounding
them
on
every
side
and
threatening
them
especially
from
the
east
let
us
consider
for
a
moment
the
dates
in
political
history
this
of
the
greek
tribes
as
hellenes
against
barbarians
seems
to
have
been
first
felt
in
the
ionian
settlements
on
the
coast
of
asia
minor
where
the
of
javan
yawan
á¼°á½±ÏÎ½
clashed
as
invaders
against
the
native
hittite
and
semite
it
was
emphasized
by
a
similar
clash
in
the
further
colonies
in
pontus
and
in
the
west
if
we
wish
for
a
central
moment
as
representing
this
of
greece
i
should
be
inclined
to
find
it
in
the
reign
of
pisistratus
when
that
monarch
made
as
it
were
the
first
sketch
of
an
athenian
empire
based
on
alliances
and
took
over
to
athens
the
leadership
of
the
ionian
race
in
literature
the
decisive
moment
is
clear
it
came
when
in
mackail
phrase
came
to
hellas
the
date
is
apparently
the
same
and
the
influences
at
work
are
the
same
it
seems
to
have
been
under
pisistratus
that
the
homeric
poems
in
some
form
or
other
came
from
ionia
to
be
recited
in
a
fixed
order
at
the
panathenaic
festival
and
to
find
a
canonical
form
and
a
central
home
in
athens
till
the
end
of
the
classical
period
athens
is
the
centre
from
which
homeric
influence
radiates
over
the
mainland
of
greece
its
effect
upon
literature
was
of
course
enormous
it
can
be
traced
in
various
ways
by
the
content
of
the
literature
which
now
begins
to
be
filled
with
the
heroic
saga
by
a
change
of
style
which
emerges
in
say
pindar
and
aeschylus
when
compared
with
what
we
know
of
corinna
or
thespis
more
objectively
and
definitely
it
can
be
traced
in
a
remarkable
change
of
dialect
the
old
attic
poets
like
solon
were
comparatively
little
affected
by
the
epic
influence
the
later
elegists
like
ion
euenus
and
plato
were
steeped
in
it
in
religion
the
cardinal
moment
is
the
same
it
consists
in
the
coming
of
homer
gods
and
that
is
to
be
the
subject
of
the
present
essay
i
am
not
of
course
going
to
describe
the
cults
and
characters
of
the
various
olympians
for
that
inquiry
the
reader
will
naturally
go
to
the
five
learned
volumes
of
my
colleague
farnell
i
wish
merely
to
face
certain
difficult
and
i
think
hitherto
unsolved
problems
affecting
the
meaning
and
origin
and
history
of
the
olympians
as
a
whole
herodotus
in
a
famous
passage
tells
us
that
homer
and
hesiod
the
generations
of
the
gods
for
the
greeks
and
gave
them
their
names
and
distinguished
their
offices
and
crafts
and
portrayed
their
shapes
the
date
of
this
wholesale
proceeding
was
he
thinks
perhaps
as
much
as
four
hundred
years
before
his
own
day
but
not
more
before
that
time
the
pelasgians
the
primitive
inhabitants
of
greece
as
opposed
to
the
hellenes
were
worshipping
gods
in
indefinite
numbers
with
no
particular
names
many
of
them
appear
as
figures
carved
emblematically
with
to
represent
the
powers
of
fertility
and
generation
like
the
athenian
the
whole
account
bristles
with
points
for
discussion
but
in
general
it
suits
very
well
with
the
picture
drawn
in
the
first
of
these
essays
with
its
earth
maidens
and
mothers
and
its
projected
kouroi
the
background
is
the
the
new
shape
impressed
upon
it
is
the
great
anthropomorphic
olympian
family
as
defined
in
the
homeric
epos
and
more
timidly
in
hesiod
but
of
hesiod
we
must
speak
later
now
who
are
these
olympian
gods
and
where
do
they
come
from
homer
did
not
them
out
of
nothing
but
the
understanding
of
them
is
beset
with
problems
in
the
first
place
why
are
they
called
are
they
the
gods
of
mount
olympus
the
old
sacred
mountain
of
homer
achaioi
or
do
they
belong
to
the
great
sanctuary
of
olympia
in
which
zeus
the
lord
of
the
olympians
had
his
greatest
festival
the
two
are
at
opposite
ends
of
greece
olympus
in
north
thessaly
in
the
olympia
in
elis
in
the
from
which
do
the
olympians
come
on
the
one
hand
it
is
clear
in
homer
that
they
dwell
on
mount
olympus
they
have
houses
beyond
human
sight
on
the
top
of
the
sacred
mountain
which
in
the
is
identified
with
heaven
on
the
other
hand
when
pisistratus
introduced
the
worship
of
olympian
zeus
on
a
great
scale
into
athens
and
built
the
olympieum
he
seems
to
have
brought
him
straight
from
olympia
in
elis
for
he
introduced
the
special
elean
complex
of
gods
zeus
rhea
kronos
and
gÃª
olympia
fortunately
this
puzzle
can
be
solved
the
olympians
belong
to
both
places
it
is
merely
a
case
of
tribal
migration
history
confirmed
by
the
study
of
the
greek
dialects
seems
to
show
that
these
northern
achaioi
came
down
across
central
greece
and
the
gulf
of
corinth
and
settled
in
elis
they
brought
with
them
their
zeus
who
was
already
called
and
established
him
as
superior
to
the
existing
god
kronos
the
games
became
olympian
and
the
sanctuary
by
which
they
were
performed
as
soon
as
this
point
is
clear
we
understand
also
why
there
is
more
than
one
mount
olympus
we
can
all
think
of
two
one
in
thessaly
and
one
across
the
aegean
in
mysia
but
there
are
many
more
some
if
i
mistake
not
in
the
whole
greek
region
it
is
a
word
applied
to
mountains
and
it
seems
clear
that
the
gods
wherever
their
worshippers
moved
tended
to
dwell
in
the
highest
mountain
in
the
neighbourhood
and
the
mountain
thereby
became
olympus
the
name
then
explains
itself
the
olympians
are
the
mountain
gods
of
the
old
invading
northmen
the
chieftains
and
princes
each
with
his
or
loose
following
of
retainers
and
minor
chieftains
who
broke
in
upon
the
ordered
splendours
of
the
aegean
palaces
and
still
more
important
on
the
ordered
simplicity
of
tribal
life
in
the
villages
of
the
mainland
now
it
is
a
canon
of
religious
study
that
all
gods
reflect
the
social
state
past
or
present
of
their
worshippers
from
this
point
of
view
what
appearance
do
the
olympians
of
homer
make
what
are
they
there
for
what
do
they
do
and
what
are
their
relations
one
to
another
the
gods
of
most
nations
claim
to
have
created
the
world
the
olympians
make
no
such
claim
the
most
they
ever
did
was
to
conquer
it
zeus
and
his
conquered
cronos
and
his
conquered
and
expelled
them
sent
them
migrating
beyond
the
horizon
heaven
knows
where
zeus
took
the
chief
dominion
and
remained
a
permanent
overlord
but
he
apportioned
large
kingdoms
to
his
brothers
hades
and
poseidon
and
confirmed
various
of
his
children
and
followers
in
lesser
fiefs
apollo
went
off
on
his
own
adventure
and
conquered
delphi
athena
conquered
the
giants
she
gained
athens
by
a
conquest
over
poseidon
a
point
of
which
we
will
speak
later
and
when
they
have
conquered
their
kingdoms
what
do
they
do
do
they
attend
to
the
government
do
they
promote
agriculture
do
they
practise
trades
and
industries
not
a
bit
of
it
why
should
they
do
any
honest
work
they
find
it
easier
to
live
on
the
revenues
and
blast
with
thunderbolts
the
people
who
do
not
pay
they
are
conquering
chieftains
royal
buccaneers
they
fight
and
feast
and
play
and
make
music
they
drink
deep
and
roar
with
laughter
at
the
lame
smith
who
waits
on
them
they
are
never
afraid
except
of
their
own
king
they
never
tell
lies
except
in
love
and
war
a
few
deductions
may
be
from
this
statement
but
they
do
not
affect
its
main
significance
one
god
you
may
say
hephaistos
is
definitely
a
craftsman
yes
a
smith
a
maker
of
weapons
the
one
craftsman
that
a
gang
of
warriors
needed
to
have
by
them
and
they
preferred
him
lame
so
that
he
should
not
run
away
again
apollo
herded
for
hire
the
cattle
of
admetus
apollo
and
poseidon
built
the
walls
of
troy
for
laomedon
certainly
in
such
stories
we
have
an
intrusion
of
other
elements
but
in
any
case
the
work
done
is
not
habitual
work
it
is
a
special
punishment
again
it
is
not
denied
that
the
olympians
have
some
effect
on
agriculture
and
on
justice
they
destroy
the
harvests
of
those
who
offend
them
they
punish
and
the
like
even
in
the
heroic
age
itself
if
we
may
adopt
chadwick
convenient
title
for
the
age
of
the
migrations
chieftains
and
gods
probably
retained
some
vestiges
of
the
functions
they
had
exercised
in
more
normal
and
settled
times
and
besides
we
must
always
realize
that
in
these
inquiries
we
never
meet
a
simple
and
uniform
figure
we
must
further
remember
that
these
gods
are
not
real
people
with
a
real
character
they
never
existed
they
are
only
concepts
exceedingly
confused
cloudy
and
changing
concepts
in
the
minds
of
thousands
of
diverse
worshippers
and
they
change
every
time
they
are
thought
of
as
a
word
changes
every
time
it
is
pronounced
even
in
the
height
of
the
achaean
wars
the
concept
of
any
one
god
would
be
mixed
up
with
traditions
and
associations
drawn
from
the
surrounding
populations
and
their
gods
and
by
the
time
they
come
down
to
us
in
homer
and
our
other
early
literature
they
have
passed
through
the
minds
of
many
different
ages
and
places
especially
ionia
and
athens
the
olympians
as
described
in
our
text
of
homer
or
as
described
in
the
athenian
recitations
of
the
sixth
century
are
related
to
the
olympians
of
the
heroic
age
much
as
the
hellenes
of
the
sixth
century
are
to
the
hellenes
of
the
heroic
age
i
say
because
the
historical
development
of
a
group
of
imaginary
concepts
shrined
in
tradition
and
romance
can
never
be
quite
the
same
as
that
of
the
people
who
conceive
them
the
realm
of
fiction
is
apt
both
to
leap
in
front
and
to
lag
in
the
rear
of
the
march
of
real
life
romance
will
hug
picturesque
darknesses
as
well
as
invent
perfections
but
the
gods
of
homer
as
we
have
them
certainly
seem
to
show
traces
of
the
process
through
which
they
have
passed
of
an
origin
among
the
old
conquering
achaioi
a
development
in
the
ionian
epic
schools
and
a
final
home
in
athens
for
example
what
gods
are
chiefly
prominent
in
homer
in
the
certainly
three
zeus
apollo
and
athena
and
much
the
same
would
hold
for
the
next
to
them
in
importance
will
be
poseidon
hera
and
hermes
zeus
stands
somewhat
apart
he
is
one
of
the
very
few
gods
with
recognizable
and
undoubted
names
djÃ«us
the
and
of
the
aryan
race
he
is
achaian
he
is
the
god
worshipped
by
all
hellenes
he
is
also
curiously
enough
pelasgian
and
a
cook
can
explain
to
us
the
seeming
contradiction
but
the
northern
elements
in
the
conception
of
zeus
have
on
the
whole
triumphed
over
any
pelasgian
or
aegean
with
which
they
may
have
mingled
and
zeus
in
spite
of
his
dark
hair
may
be
mainly
treated
as
the
patriarchal
god
of
the
invading
northmen
passing
from
the
upper
danube
down
by
his
three
great
sanctuaries
dodona
olympus
and
olympia
he
had
an
extraordinary
power
of
ousting
or
absorbing
the
various
objects
of
aboriginal
worship
which
he
found
in
his
path
the
story
of
meilichios
above
is
a
common
one
of
course
we
must
not
suppose
that
the
zeus
of
the
actual
achaioi
was
a
figure
quite
like
the
zeus
of
pheidias
or
of
homer
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
expurgation
in
the
homeric
zeus
as
cook
clearly
shows
the
counsellor
and
of
classical
athens
was
the
wizard
and
rainmaker
of
earlier
times
and
the
surprises
us
in
thera
and
crete
by
appearing
both
as
a
babe
and
as
a
kouros
in
spring
dances
and
initiation
rituals
it
is
a
long
way
from
these
conceptions
to
the
zeus
of
aeschylus
a
figure
as
sublime
as
the
jehovah
of
job
but
the
lineage
seems
clear
zeus
is
the
achaean
his
son
phoebus
apollo
is
of
more
complex
make
on
one
side
he
is
clearly
a
northman
he
has
connexions
with
the
hyperboreans
he
has
a
road
leading
far
into
the
north
along
which
offerings
are
sent
back
from
shrine
to
shrine
beyond
the
bounds
of
greek
knowledge
such
roads
are
normally
the
roads
by
which
the
god
himself
has
travelled
the
offerings
are
sent
back
from
the
new
sanctuary
to
the
old
on
the
other
side
apollo
reaches
back
to
an
aegean
matriarchal
kouros
his
home
is
delos
where
he
has
a
mother
leto
but
no
very
visible
father
he
leads
the
ships
of
his
islanders
sometimes
in
the
form
of
a
dolphin
he
is
no
in
the
fighting
at
troy
he
is
against
the
achaioi
he
destroys
the
greek
host
he
champions
hector
he
even
slays
achilles
in
the
homeric
hymn
to
apollo
we
read
that
when
the
great
archer
draws
near
to
olympus
all
the
gods
tremble
and
start
from
their
seats
leto
alone
and
of
course
zeus
hold
their
ground
what
this
god
original
name
was
at
delos
we
can
not
be
sure
he
has
very
many
names
and
but
he
early
became
identified
with
a
similar
god
at
delphi
and
adopted
his
name
or
in
the
delphic
and
dorian
form
presumably
the
kouros
projected
from
the
dorian
gatherings
called
as
phoibos
he
is
a
and
from
classical
times
onward
we
often
find
him
definitely
identified
with
the
sun
a
distinction
which
came
easily
to
a
kouros
in
any
case
and
this
is
the
important
point
he
is
at
delos
the
chief
god
of
the
ionians
the
ionians
are
defined
by
herodotus
as
those
tribes
and
cities
who
were
sprung
from
athens
and
kept
the
apaturia
they
recognized
delos
as
their
holy
place
and
worshipped
apollo
patrÃ´os
as
their
ancestor
the
ionian
homer
has
naturally
brought
us
the
ionian
god
and
significantly
enough
though
the
tradition
makes
him
an
enemy
of
the
greeks
and
the
poets
have
to
accept
the
tradition
there
is
no
tendency
to
crab
or
belittle
him
he
is
the
most
splendid
and
awful
of
homer
olympians
the
case
of
pallas
athena
is
even
simpler
though
it
leads
to
a
somewhat
surprising
result
what
apollo
is
to
ionia
that
and
more
athena
is
to
athens
there
are
doubtless
foreign
elements
in
athena
some
cretan
and
ionian
some
northern
but
her
whole
appearance
in
history
and
literature
tells
the
same
story
as
her
name
athens
is
her
city
and
she
is
the
goddess
of
athens
the
athena
or
athenaia
korÃª
in
athens
she
can
be
simply
the
maiden
elsewhere
she
is
the
or
maiden
as
glaucopis
she
is
identified
or
associated
with
the
owl
that
was
the
sacred
bird
of
athens
as
pallas
she
seems
to
be
a
a
sort
of
keraunia
or
bride
of
keraunos
a
palladion
consists
of
two
set
one
above
the
other
like
a
figure
and
we
can
trace
in
the
development
of
this
into
a
human
figure
it
seems
clear
that
the
old
achaioi
can
not
have
called
their
daughter
of
zeus
by
the
name
athena
or
athenaia
the
athenian
goddess
must
have
come
in
from
athenian
influence
and
it
is
strange
to
find
how
deep
into
the
heart
of
the
poems
that
influence
must
have
reached
if
we
try
to
conjecture
whose
place
it
is
that
athena
has
taken
it
is
worth
remarking
that
her
regular
epithet
of
zeus
belongs
in
sanskrit
to
the
eÃ´s
the
transition
might
be
helped
by
some
touches
of
the
that
seem
to
linger
about
athena
in
myth
the
rising
sun
stayed
his
horses
while
athena
was
born
from
the
head
of
zeus
also
she
was
born
amid
a
snowstorm
of
gold
and
eÃ´s
on
the
other
hand
is
like
athena
sometimes
the
daughter
of
the
giant
pallas
our
three
chief
olympians
then
explain
themselves
very
easily
a
body
of
poetry
and
tradition
in
its
origin
dating
from
the
achaioi
of
the
migrations
growing
for
centuries
in
the
hands
of
ionian
bards
and
reaching
its
culminating
form
at
athens
has
prominent
in
it
the
achaian
zeus
the
ionian
apollo
the
athenian
korÃª
the
same
korÃª
who
descended
in
person
to
restore
the
exiled
pisistratus
to
his
throne
we
need
only
throw
a
glance
in
passing
at
a
few
of
the
other
olympians
why
for
instance
should
poseidon
be
so
prominent
in
origin
he
is
a
puzzling
figure
besides
the
achaean
brother
of
zeus
in
thessaly
there
seems
to
be
some
pelasgian
or
aegean
god
present
in
him
he
is
closely
connected
with
libya
he
brings
the
horse
from
there
at
times
he
exists
in
order
to
be
defeated
defeated
in
athens
by
athena
in
naxos
by
dionysus
in
aegina
by
zeus
in
argos
by
hera
in
acrocorinth
by
helios
though
he
continues
to
hold
the
isthmus
in
trozen
he
shares
a
temple
on
more
or
less
equal
terms
with
athena
even
in
troy
he
is
defeated
and
cast
out
from
the
walls
his
own
hands
had
built
these
problems
we
need
not
for
the
present
face
by
the
time
that
concerns
us
most
the
is
a
specially
important
to
the
of
athens
and
ionia
he
is
the
father
of
neleus
the
ancestor
of
the
ionian
kings
his
temple
at
cape
mykale
is
the
scene
of
the
panionia
and
second
only
to
delos
as
a
religious
centre
of
the
ionian
tribes
he
has
intimate
relations
with
attica
too
besides
the
ancient
contest
with
athena
for
the
possession
of
the
land
he
appears
as
the
father
of
theseus
the
chief
athenian
hero
he
is
merged
in
other
attic
heroes
like
aigeus
and
erechtheus
he
is
the
special
patron
of
the
athenian
knights
thus
his
prominence
in
homer
is
very
natural
what
of
hermes
his
history
deserves
a
long
monograph
to
itself
it
is
so
exceptionally
instructive
originally
outside
homer
hermes
was
simply
an
old
upright
stone
a
pillar
furnished
with
the
regular
pelasgian
of
procreation
set
up
over
a
tomb
he
is
the
power
that
generates
new
lives
or
in
the
ancient
conception
brings
the
souls
back
to
be
born
again
he
is
the
guide
of
the
dead
the
psychopompos
the
divine
herald
between
the
two
worlds
if
you
have
a
message
for
the
dead
you
speak
it
to
the
herm
at
the
grave
this
notion
of
hermes
as
herald
may
have
been
helped
by
his
use
as
a
the
latin
your
is
your
representative
the
deliverer
of
your
message
to
the
hostile
neighbour
or
alien
if
you
wish
to
parley
with
him
you
advance
up
to
your
if
you
go
as
a
herald
peacefully
into
his
territory
you
place
yourself
under
the
protection
of
the
same
sacred
stone
the
last
sign
that
remains
of
your
own
safe
country
if
you
are
killed
or
wronged
it
is
he
the
immovable
watcher
who
will
avenge
you
now
this
phallic
stone
post
was
quite
unsuitable
to
homer
it
was
not
decent
it
was
not
quite
human
and
every
personage
in
homer
has
to
be
both
in
the
hermes
is
simply
removed
and
a
beautiful
creation
or
tradition
iris
the
takes
his
place
as
the
messenger
from
heaven
to
earth
in
the
he
is
admitted
but
so
changed
and
castigated
that
no
one
would
recognize
the
old
herm
in
the
beautiful
and
gracious
youth
who
performs
the
gods
messages
i
can
only
detect
in
his
language
one
possible
trace
of
his
old
pelasgian
character
pausanias
knew
who
worked
the
transformation
in
speaking
of
hermes
among
the
other
who
were
in
square
form
he
says
to
hermes
the
poems
of
homer
have
given
currency
to
the
report
that
he
is
a
servant
of
zeus
and
leads
down
the
spirits
of
the
departed
to
hades
in
the
magic
papyri
hermes
returns
to
something
of
his
old
functions
he
is
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
the
agathos
daimon
but
thanks
to
homer
he
is
purified
of
his
old
phallicism
hera
too
the
wife
of
zeus
seems
to
have
a
curious
past
behind
her
she
has
certainly
ousted
the
original
wife
dione
whose
worship
continued
unchallenged
in
far
dodona
from
times
before
zeus
descended
upon
greek
lands
when
he
invaded
thessaly
he
seems
to
have
left
dione
behind
and
wedded
the
queen
of
the
conquered
territory
hera
permanent
epithet
is
she
is
the
argive
korÃª
or
as
athena
is
the
attic
cypris
the
cyprian
but
argos
in
homer
denotes
two
different
places
a
watered
plain
in
the
peloponnese
and
a
watered
plain
in
thessaly
hera
was
certainly
the
chief
goddess
of
peloponnesian
argos
in
historic
times
and
had
brought
her
consort
herakles
along
with
her
but
at
one
time
she
seems
to
have
belonged
to
the
thessalian
argos
she
helped
thessalian
jason
to
launch
the
ship
and
they
launched
it
from
thessalian
pagasae
in
the
argonautica
she
is
a
beautiful
figure
gracious
and
strong
the
lovely
patroness
of
the
young
hero
no
element
of
strife
is
haunting
her
but
in
the
for
some
reason
she
is
unpopular
she
is
a
shrew
a
scold
and
a
jealous
wife
why
miss
harrison
suggests
that
the
quarrel
with
zeus
dates
from
the
time
of
the
invasion
when
he
was
the
conquering
alien
and
she
the
native
queen
of
the
land
it
may
be
too
that
the
ionian
poets
who
respected
their
own
apollo
and
athena
and
poseidon
regarded
hera
as
representing
some
race
or
tribe
that
they
disliked
a
goddess
of
dorian
argos
might
be
as
disagreeable
as
a
dorian
it
seems
to
be
for
some
reason
like
this
that
aphrodite
identified
with
cyprus
or
some
centre
among
oriental
barbarians
is
handled
with
so
much
disrespect
that
ares
the
thracian
kouros
a
and
is
treated
as
a
mere
bully
and
coward
and
general
pest
there
is
not
much
faith
in
these
gods
as
they
appear
to
us
in
the
homeric
poems
and
not
much
respect
except
perhaps
for
apollo
and
athena
and
poseidon
the
buccaneer
kings
of
the
heroic
age
cut
loose
from
all
local
and
tribal
pieties
intent
only
on
personal
gain
and
glory
were
not
the
people
to
build
up
a
powerful
religious
faith
they
left
that
as
they
left
agriculture
and
handiwork
to
the
nameless
common
folk
and
it
was
not
likely
that
the
bards
of
cultivated
and
scientific
ionia
should
waste
much
religious
emotion
on
a
system
which
was
clearly
meant
more
for
romance
than
for
the
guiding
of
life
yet
the
power
of
romance
is
great
in
the
memory
of
greece
the
kings
and
gods
of
the
heroic
age
were
transfigured
what
had
been
really
an
age
of
buccaneering
violence
became
in
memory
an
age
of
chivalry
and
splendid
adventure
the
traits
that
were
at
all
tolerable
were
idealized
those
that
were
intolerable
were
either
expurgated
or
if
that
was
impossible
were
mysticized
and
explained
away
and
the
savage
old
olympians
became
to
athens
and
the
mainland
of
greece
from
the
sixth
century
onward
emblems
of
high
humanity
and
religious
reform
ii
religious
value
of
the
now
to
some
people
this
statement
may
seem
a
wilful
paradox
yet
i
believe
it
to
be
true
the
olympian
religion
radiating
from
homer
at
the
panathenaea
produced
what
i
will
venture
to
call
exactly
a
religious
reformation
let
us
consider
how
with
all
its
flaws
and
falsehoods
it
was
fitted
to
attempt
such
a
work
in
the
first
place
the
poems
represent
an
achaian
tradition
the
tradition
of
a
northern
conquering
race
organized
on
a
patriarchal
monogamous
system
vehemently
distinct
from
the
matrilinear
customs
of
the
aegean
or
hittite
races
with
their
polygamy
and
polyandry
their
agricultural
rites
their
and
fertility
goddesses
contrast
for
a
moment
the
sort
of
sexless
valkyrie
who
appears
in
the
under
the
name
of
athena
with
the
korÃª
of
ephesus
strangely
called
artemis
a
shapeless
fertility
figure
covered
with
innumerable
breasts
that
suggests
the
contrast
that
i
mean
secondly
the
poems
are
by
tradition
aristocratic
they
are
the
literature
of
chieftains
alien
to
low
popular
superstition
true
the
poems
as
we
have
them
are
not
court
poems
that
error
ought
not
to
be
so
often
repeated
as
we
have
them
they
are
poems
recited
at
a
panegyris
or
public
festival
but
they
go
back
in
ultimate
origin
to
something
like
lays
sung
in
a
royal
hall
and
the
contrast
between
the
homeric
gods
and
the
gods
found
outside
homer
is
well
compared
by
chadwick
to
the
difference
between
the
gods
of
the
edda
and
the
historical
traces
of
religion
outside
the
edda
the
gods
who
feast
with
odin
in
asgard
forming
an
organized
community
or
seem
to
be
the
gods
of
the
kings
distinct
from
the
gods
of
the
peasants
cleaner
and
more
warlike
and
lordlier
though
in
actual
religious
quality
much
less
vital
thirdly
the
poems
in
their
main
stages
are
ionian
and
ionia
was
for
many
reasons
calculated
to
lead
the
forward
movement
against
the
for
one
thing
ionia
reinforced
the
old
heroic
tradition
in
having
much
the
same
inward
freedom
the
ionians
are
the
descendants
of
those
who
fled
from
the
invaders
across
the
sea
leaving
their
homes
tribes
and
tribal
traditions
wilamowitz
has
well
remarked
how
the
imagination
of
the
greek
mainland
is
dominated
by
the
gigantic
sepulchres
of
unknown
kings
which
the
fugitives
to
asia
had
left
behind
them
and
half
forgotten
again
when
the
ionians
settled
on
the
asiatic
coasts
they
were
no
doubt
to
some
extent
influenced
but
they
were
far
more
repelled
by
the
barbaric
tribes
of
the
interior
they
became
conscious
as
we
have
said
of
something
that
was
hellenic
as
distinct
from
something
else
that
was
barbaric
and
the
hellenic
part
of
them
vehemently
rejected
what
struck
them
as
superstitious
cruel
or
unclean
and
lastly
we
must
remember
that
ionia
was
before
the
rise
of
athens
not
only
the
most
imaginative
and
intellectual
part
of
greece
but
by
far
the
most
advanced
in
knowledge
and
culture
the
homeric
religion
is
a
step
in
the
of
greece
and
such
naturally
took
its
rise
in
ionia
granted
then
that
homer
was
calculated
to
produce
a
kind
of
religious
reformation
in
greece
what
kind
of
reformation
was
it
we
are
again
reminded
of
paul
it
was
a
move
away
from
the
towards
some
imagined
person
behind
them
the
world
was
conceived
as
neither
quite
without
external
governance
nor
as
merely
subject
to
the
incursions
of
snakes
and
bulls
and
and
monsters
but
as
governed
by
an
organized
body
of
personal
and
reasoning
rulers
wise
and
bountiful
fathers
like
man
in
mind
and
shape
only
unspeakably
higher
for
a
type
of
this
olympian
spirit
we
may
take
a
phenomenon
that
has
perhaps
sometimes
wearied
us
the
reiterated
insistence
in
the
reliefs
of
the
best
period
on
the
strife
of
men
against
centaurs
or
of
gods
against
giants
our
modern
sympathies
are
apt
to
side
with
the
giants
and
centaurs
an
age
of
order
likes
romantic
violence
as
landsmen
safe
in
their
houses
like
storms
at
sea
but
to
the
greek
this
battle
was
full
of
symbolical
meaning
it
is
the
strife
the
ultimate
victory
of
human
intelligence
reason
and
gentleness
against
what
seems
at
first
the
overwhelming
power
of
passion
and
unguided
strength
it
is
hellas
against
the
brute
world
the
victory
of
hellenism
over
barbarism
of
man
over
beast
that
was
the
aim
but
was
it
ever
accomplished
the
olympian
gods
as
we
see
them
in
art
appear
so
calm
so
perfect
so
far
removed
from
the
atmosphere
of
acknowledged
imperfection
and
spiritual
striving
that
what
i
am
now
about
to
say
may
again
seem
a
deliberate
paradox
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
the
olympian
religion
is
only
to
the
full
intelligible
and
admirable
if
we
realize
it
as
a
superb
and
baffled
endeavour
not
a
or
completion
but
a
movement
and
effort
of
life
we
may
analyse
the
movement
into
three
main
elements
a
moral
expurgation
of
the
old
rites
an
attempt
to
bring
order
into
the
old
chaos
and
lastly
an
adaptation
to
new
social
needs
we
will
take
the
three
in
order
in
the
first
place
it
gradually
swept
out
of
religion
or
at
least
covered
with
a
decent
veil
that
great
mass
of
rites
which
was
concerned
with
the
and
the
and
aimed
at
direct
stimulation
of
generative
processes
it
left
only
a
few
reverent
and
mystic
rituals
a
few
licensed
outbursts
of
riotous
indecency
in
comedy
and
the
agricultural
festivals
it
swept
away
what
seems
to
us
a
thing
less
dangerous
a
large
part
of
the
worship
of
the
dead
such
worship
our
evidence
shows
us
gave
a
loose
rein
to
superstition
to
the
olympian
movement
it
was
vulgar
it
was
it
was
often
bloody
we
find
that
it
has
almost
disappeared
from
homeric
athens
at
a
time
when
the
monuments
show
it
still
flourishing
in
sparta
the
olympian
movement
swept
away
also
at
least
for
two
splendid
centuries
the
worship
of
the
with
its
diseased
atmosphere
of
megalomania
and
these
things
return
with
the
fall
of
hellenism
but
the
great
period
as
it
urges
man
to
use
all
his
powers
of
thought
of
daring
and
endurance
of
social
organization
so
it
bids
him
remember
that
he
is
a
man
like
other
men
subject
to
the
same
laws
and
bound
to
reckon
with
the
same
death
so
much
for
the
moral
expurgation
next
for
the
bringing
of
intellectual
order
to
parody
the
words
of
anaxagoras
the
early
religion
all
things
were
together
till
the
homeric
system
came
and
arranged
them
we
constantly
find
in
the
greek
pantheon
beings
who
can
be
described
as
ÏÎ¿Î»Î»á¿¶Î½
á½Î½Î¿Î¼á½±ÏÏÎ½
Î¼Î¿ÏÏá½´
Î¼á¼´Î±
form
of
many
names
each
tribe
each
little
community
sometimes
one
may
almost
say
each
caste
the
children
of
the
bards
the
children
of
the
potters
had
its
own
special
gods
now
as
soon
as
there
was
any
general
or
any
effective
surmounting
of
the
narrowest
local
barriers
these
innumerable
gods
tended
to
melt
into
one
another
under
different
historical
circumstances
this
process
might
have
been
carried
resolutely
through
and
produced
an
intelligible
pantheon
in
which
each
god
had
his
proper
function
and
there
was
no
overlapping
one
korÃª
one
kouros
one
and
so
on
but
in
greece
that
was
impossible
imaginations
had
been
too
vivid
and
local
types
had
too
often
become
clearly
personified
and
differentiated
the
maiden
of
athens
athena
did
no
doubt
absorb
some
other
korai
but
she
could
not
possibly
combine
with
her
of
cythÃªra
or
cyprus
or
ephesus
nor
with
the
argive
korÃª
or
the
delian
or
the
brauronian
what
happened
was
that
the
infinite
cloud
of
maidens
was
greatly
reduced
and
fell
into
four
or
five
main
types
the
korai
of
cyprus
cythÃªra
corinth
eryx
and
some
other
places
were
felt
to
be
one
and
became
absorbed
in
the
great
figure
of
aphrodite
artemis
absorbed
a
quantity
more
including
those
of
delos
and
brauron
of
various
parts
of
arcadia
and
sparta
and
even
as
we
saw
the
fertility
korÃª
of
ephesus
doubtless
she
and
the
delian
were
originally
much
closer
together
but
the
delian
differentiated
towards
ideal
virginity
the
ephesian
towards
ideal
fruitfulness
the
kouroi
or
youths
in
the
same
way
were
absorbed
into
some
great
mythological
shapes
apollo
ares
hermes
dionysus
and
the
like
as
so
often
in
greek
development
we
are
brought
up
against
the
immense
formative
power
of
fiction
or
romance
the
simple
korÃª
or
kouros
was
a
figure
of
indistinct
outline
with
no
history
or
personality
like
the
roman
functional
gods
such
beings
were
hardly
persons
they
melted
easily
one
into
another
but
when
the
greek
imagination
had
once
done
its
work
upon
them
a
figure
like
athena
or
aphrodite
had
become
for
all
practical
purposes
a
definite
person
almost
as
definite
as
achilles
or
odysseus
as
macbeth
or
falstaff
they
crystallize
hard
they
will
no
longer
melt
or
blend
at
least
not
at
an
ordinary
temperature
in
the
fourth
and
third
centuries
we
hear
a
great
deal
about
the
gods
all
being
one
the
same
as
hades
hades
as
helios
helios
the
same
as
dionysus
but
the
amalgamation
only
takes
place
in
the
white
heat
of
ecstatic
philosophy
or
the
rites
of
religious
mysticism
the
best
document
preserved
to
us
of
this
attempt
to
bring
order
into
chaos
is
the
poetry
of
hesiod
there
are
three
poems
all
devoted
to
this
object
composed
perhaps
under
the
influence
of
delphi
and
certainly
under
that
of
homer
and
trying
in
a
dialect
and
under
a
system
to
bring
together
vast
masses
of
ancient
theology
and
and
scattered
tradition
the
attempts
to
make
a
pedigree
and
hierarchy
of
the
gods
catalogue
of
and
the
preserved
only
in
scanty
fragments
attempt
to
fix
in
canonical
form
the
cloudy
mixture
of
dreams
and
boasts
and
legends
and
hypotheses
by
which
most
royal
families
in
central
greece
recorded
their
descent
from
a
traditional
ancestress
and
a
conjectural
god
the
and
form
an
attempt
to
collect
and
arrange
the
rules
and
tabus
relating
to
agriculture
the
work
of
hesiod
as
a
whole
is
one
of
the
most
valiant
failures
in
literature
the
confusion
and
absurdity
of
it
are
only
equalled
by
its
strange
helpless
beauty
and
its
extraordinary
historical
interest
the
hesiodic
system
when
compared
with
that
of
homer
is
much
more
explicit
much
less
expurgated
infinitely
less
accomplished
and
tactful
at
the
back
of
homer
lay
the
lordly
of
the
heroic
age
at
the
back
of
hesiod
the
crude
and
tangled
superstitions
of
the
peasantry
of
the
mainland
also
the
hesiodic
poets
worked
in
a
comparatively
backward
and
unenlightened
atmosphere
the
homeric
were
exposed
to
the
full
light
of
athens
the
third
element
in
this
homeric
reformation
is
an
attempt
to
make
religion
satisfy
the
needs
of
a
new
social
order
the
earliest
greek
religion
was
clearly
based
on
the
tribe
a
band
of
people
all
in
some
sense
kindred
and
normally
living
together
people
with
the
same
customs
ancestors
initiations
flocks
and
herds
and
fields
this
tribal
and
agricultural
religion
can
hardly
have
maintained
itself
unchanged
at
the
great
aegean
centres
like
cnossus
and
mycenae
it
certainly
did
not
maintain
itself
among
the
marauding
chiefs
of
the
heroic
age
it
bowed
its
head
beneath
the
sceptre
of
its
own
divine
kings
and
the
armed
heel
of
its
northern
invaders
only
to
appear
again
almost
undamaged
and
unimproved
when
the
kings
were
fallen
and
the
invaders
sunk
into
the
soil
like
storms
of
destructive
rain
but
it
no
longer
suited
its
environment
in
the
age
of
the
migrations
the
tribes
had
been
broken
scattered
they
had
almost
ceased
to
exist
as
important
social
entities
the
social
unit
which
had
taken
their
place
was
the
political
community
of
men
of
whatever
tribe
or
tribes
who
were
held
together
in
times
of
danger
and
constant
war
by
means
of
a
common
a
polis
the
idea
of
the
tribe
remained
in
the
earliest
classical
period
we
find
every
greek
city
still
nominally
composed
of
tribes
but
the
tribes
are
fictitious
the
early
could
still
only
conceive
of
society
on
a
tribal
basis
every
local
or
accidental
congregation
of
people
who
wish
to
act
together
have
to
invent
an
imaginary
common
ancestor
the
clash
between
the
old
tribal
traditions
that
have
lost
their
meaning
though
not
their
sanctity
and
the
new
duties
imposed
by
the
actual
needs
of
the
polis
leads
to
many
strange
and
interesting
compromises
the
famous
constitution
of
cleisthenes
shows
several
an
old
proverb
expresses
well
the
ordinary
feeling
on
the
subject

the
city
may
do
but
the
old
custom
is
the
best
now
in
the
contest
between
city
and
tribe
the
olympian
gods
had
one
great
negative
advantage
they
were
not
tribal
or
local
and
all
other
gods
were
they
were
by
this
time
international
with
no
strong
roots
anywhere
except
where
one
of
them
could
be
identified
with
some
native
god
they
were
full
of
fame
and
beauty
and
prestige
they
were
ready
to
be
made
of
any
particular
city
still
more
ready
to
be
patrons
of
all
hellas
in
the
working
out
of
these
three
aims
the
olympian
religion
achieved
much
in
all
three
it
failed
the
moral
expurgation
failed
owing
to
the
mere
force
of
inertia
possessed
by
old
religious
traditions
and
local
cults
we
must
remember
how
weak
any
central
government
was
in
ancient
civilization
the
power
and
influence
of
a
highly
civilized
society
were
apt
to
end
a
few
miles
outside
its
city
wall
all
through
the
backward
parts
of
greece
obscene
and
cruel
rites
lingered
on
the
darker
and
worse
the
further
they
were
removed
from
the
full
light
of
hellenism
but
in
this
respect
the
olympian
religion
did
not
merely
fail
it
did
worse
to
make
the
elements
of
a
human
is
inevitably
to
make
them
vicious
there
is
no
great
moral
harm
in
worshipping
a
even
though
the
lightning
strikes
the
good
and
evil
quite
recklessly
there
is
no
need
to
pretend
that
the
lightning
is
exercising
a
wise
and
righteous
choice
but
when
once
you
worship
an
imaginary
being
who
throws
the
lightning
you
are
in
a
dilemma
either
you
have
to
admit
that
you
are
worshipping
and
flattering
a
being
with
no
moral
sense
because
he
happens
to
be
dangerous
or
else
you
have
to
invent
reasons
for
his
wrath
against
the
people
who
happen
to
be
struck
and
they
are
pretty
sure
to
be
bad
reasons
the
god
if
personal
becomes
capricious
and
cruel
when
the
ark
of
israel
was
being
brought
back
from
the
philistines
the
cattle
slipped
by
the
threshing
floor
of
nachon
and
the
holy
object
was
in
danger
of
falling
a
certain
uzzah
as
we
all
know
sprang
forward
to
save
it
and
was
struck
dead
for
his
pains
now
if
he
was
struck
dead
by
the
sheer
holiness
of
the
tabu
object
the
holiness
stored
inside
it
like
so
much
electricity
his
death
was
a
misfortune
an
interesting
accident
and
no
more
but
when
it
is
made
into
the
deliberate
act
of
an
anthropomorphic
god
who
strikes
a
man
dead
in
explosive
rage
for
a
very
pardonable
mistake
a
dangerous
element
has
been
introduced
into
the
ethics
of
that
religion
a
being
who
is
the
moral
equal
of
man
must
not
behave
like
a
charge
of
dynamite
again
to
worship
emblems
of
fertility
and
generation
as
was
done
in
agricultural
rites
all
through
the
aegean
area
is
in
itself
an
intelligible
and
not
necessarily
a
degrading
practice
but
when
those
emblems
are
somehow
humanized
and
the
result
is
an
anthropomorphic
god
of
enormous
procreative
power
and
innumerable
amours
a
religion
so
modified
has
received
a
the
step
that
was
meant
to
soften
its
grossness
has
resulted
in
its
moral
degradation
this
result
was
intensified
by
another
effort
at
elevation
the
leading
tribes
of
central
greece
were
as
we
have
mentioned
apt
to
count
their
descent
from
some
her
consort
was
sometimes
unknown
and
in
a
matrilinear
society
unimportant
sometimes
he
was
a
local
god
or
river
when
the
olympians
came
to
introduce
some
order
and
unity
among
these
innumerable
local
gods
the
original
tribal
ancestor
tended
naturally
enough
to
be
identified
with
zeus
apollo
or
poseidon
the
unfortunate
olympians
whose
system
really
aimed
at
purer
morals
and
condemned
polygamy
and
polyandry
are
left
with
a
crowd
of
consorts
that
would
put
solomon
to
shame
thus
a
failure
in
the
moral
expurgation
was
deepened
by
a
failure
in
the
attempt
to
bring
intellectual
order
into
the
welter
of
primitive
gods
the
only
satisfactory
end
of
that
effort
would
have
been
monotheism
if
zeus
had
only
gone
further
and
become
completely
once
and
for
all
the
father
of
all
life
the
scandalous
stories
would
have
lost
their
point
and
meaning
it
is
curious
how
near
to
monotheism
and
to
monotheism
of
a
very
profound
and
impersonal
type
the
real
religion
of
greece
came
in
the
sixth
and
fifth
centuries
many
of
the
philosophers
xenophanes
parmenides
and
others
asserted
it
clearly
or
assumed
it
without
hesitation
aeschylus
euripides
plato
in
their
deeper
moments
point
the
same
road
indeed
a
metaphysician
might
hold
that
their
theology
is
far
deeper
than
that
to
which
we
are
accustomed
since
they
seem
not
to
make
any
particular
difference
between
Î¿á¼±
Î¸ÎµÎ¿á½·
and
á½
Î¸Îµá½¹Ï
or
Ïá½¸
Î¸Îµá¿Î¿Î½
they
do
not
instinctively
suppose
that
the
human
distinctions
between
and
or
between
and
apply
to
the
divine
certainly
greek
monotheism
had
it
really
carried
the
day
would
have
been
a
far
more
philosophic
thing
than
the
tribal
and
personal
monotheism
of
the
hebrews
but
unfortunately
too
many
superstitions
too
many
tender
and
sensitive
associations
were
linked
with
particular
figures
in
the
pantheon
or
particular
rites
which
had
brought
the
worshippers
religious
peace
if
there
had
been
some
hebrew
prophets
about
and
a
tyrant
or
two
progressive
and
to
agree
with
them
polytheism
might
perhaps
actually
have
been
stamped
out
in
greece
at
one
time
but
greek
thought
always
sincere
and
daring
was
seldom
brutal
seldom
ruthless
or
cruel
the
thinkers
of
the
great
period
felt
their
own
way
gently
to
the
holy
of
holies
and
did
not
try
to
compel
others
to
take
the
same
way
greek
theology
whether
popular
or
philosophical
seldom
denied
any
god
seldom
forbade
any
worship
what
it
tried
to
do
was
to
identify
every
new
god
with
some
aspect
of
one
of
the
old
ones
and
the
result
was
naturally
confusion
apart
from
the
epicurean
school
which
though
powerful
was
always
unpopular
the
religious
thought
of
later
antiquity
for
the
most
part
took
refuge
in
a
sort
of
apotheosis
of
good
taste
in
which
the
great
care
was
not
to
hurt
other
people
feelings
or
else
it
collapsed
into
helpless
mysticism
the
attempt
to
make
olympianism
a
religion
of
the
polis
failed
also
the
olympians
did
not
belong
to
any
particular
city
they
were
too
universal
and
no
particular
city
had
a
very
positive
faith
in
them
the
actual
polis
was
real
and
tangible
the
homeric
gods
a
little
alien
and
literary
the
city
herself
was
a
most
real
power
and
the
true
gods
of
the
city
who
had
grown
out
of
the
soil
and
the
wall
were
simply
the
city
herself
in
her
eternal
and
personal
aspect
as
mother
and
guide
and
lawgiver
the
worshipped
and
beloved
being
whom
each
citizen
must
defend
even
to
the
death

the

the

by
siding

it

in

appeal

what
then
amid
all
this
failure
did
the
olympian
religion
really
achieve
first
it
debarbarized
the
worship
of
the
leading
states
of
greece
not
of
all
greece
since
antiquity
had
no
means
of
spreading
knowledge
comparable
to
ours
it
reduced
the
horrors
of
the
for
the
most
part
to
a
romantic
memory
and
made
religion
no
longer
a
mortal
danger
to
humanity
unlike
many
religious
systems
it
generally
permitted
progress
it
encouraged
not
only
the
obedient
virtues
but
the
daring
virtues
as
well
it
had
in
it
the
spirit
that
saves
from
disaster
that
knows
itself
fallible
and
thinks
twice
before
it
hates
and
curses
and
persecutes
it
wrapped
religion
in
sophrosynÃª
again
it
worked
for
concord
and
throughout
the
greek
communities
it
is
after
all
a
good
deal
to
say
that
in
greek
history
we
find
almost
no
warring
of
sects
no
mutual
tortures
or
even
blasphemies
with
many
ragged
edges
with
many
weaknesses
it
built
up
something
like
a
united
hellenic
religion
to
stand
against
the
devices
of
the
heathen
and
after
all
if
we
are
inclined
on
the
purely
religious
side
to
judge
the
olympian
system
harshly
we
must
not
forget
its
sheer
beauty
truth
no
doubt
is
greater
than
beauty
but
in
many
matters
beauty
can
be
attained
and
truth
can
not
all
we
know
is
that
when
the
best
minds
seek
for
truth
the
result
is
apt
to
be
beautiful
it
was
a
great
thing
that
men
should
envisage
the
world
as
governed
not
by
giants
and
gorgons
and
dealers
in
eternal
torture
but
by
some
human
and
more
than
human
understanding
Î¾á½»Î½ÎµÏÎ¹Ï
by
beings
of
quiet
splendour
like
many
a
classical
zeus
and
hermes
and
demeter
if
olympianism
was
not
a
religious
faith
it
was
at
least
a
vital
force
in
the
shaping
of
cities
and
societies
which
remain
after
two
thousand
years
a
type
to
the
world
of
beauty
and
freedom
and
high
endeavour
even
the
stirring
of
its
ashes
when
they
seemed
long
cold
had
power
to
produce
something
of
the
same
result
for
the
classicism
of
the
italian
renaissance
is
a
child
however
fallen
of
the
olympian
spirit
of
course
i
recognize
that
beauty
is
not
the
same
as
faith
there
is
in
one
sense
far
more
faith
in
some
hideous
icon
which
sends
out
starving
peasants
to
massacre
jews
than
in
the
athena
of
phidias
yet
once
we
have
rid
our
minds
of
trivial
mythology
there
is
religion
in
athena
also
athena
is
an
ideal
an
ideal
and
a
mystery
the
ideal
of
wisdom
of
incessant
labour
of
almost
terrifying
purity
seen
through
the
light
of
some
mystic
and
spiritual
devotion
like
but
transcending
the
love
of
man
for
woman
or
if
the
way
of
athena
is
too
hard
for
us
common
men
it
is
not
hard
to
find
a
true
religious
ideal
in
such
a
figure
as
persephone
in
persephone
there
is
more
of
pathos
and
of
mystery
she
has
more
recently
entered
the
calm
ranks
of
olympus
the
old
liturgy
of
the
dying
and
still
clings
to
her
if
religion
is
that
which
brings
us
into
relation
with
the
great
there
is
the
very
heart
of
life
in
this
bride
of
the
underworld
life
with
its
broken
hopes
its
disaster
its
spiritual
joy
life
seen
as
mother
and
daughter
not
a
thing
continuous
and
unchanging
but
shot
through
with
parting
and
death
life
as
a
great
love
or
desire
ever
torn
asunder
and
ever
renewed
stay
a
reader
may
object
not
this
the
persephone
the
athena
of
modern
sentiment
are
these
figures
really
the
goddesses
of
the
and
of
sophocles
the
truth
is
i
think
that
they
are
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
they
are
the
goddesses
of
ancient
reflection
and
allegory
the
goddesses
that
is
of
the
best
and
most
characteristic
worship
that
these
idealized
creations
awakened
what
we
have
treated
hitherto
as
the
mortal
weakness
of
the
olympians
the
fact
that
they
have
no
roots
in
any
particular
soil
little
hold
on
any
definite
primeval
cult
has
turned
out
to
be
their
peculiar
strength
we
must
not
think
of
allegory
as
a
late
phenomenon
in
greece
it
begins
at
least
as
early
as
pythagoras
and
heraclitus
perhaps
as
early
as
hesiod
for
hesiod
seems
sometimes
to
be
turning
allegory
back
into
myth
the
olympians
cut
loose
from
the
soil
enthroned
only
in
men
free
imagination
have
two
special
regions
which
they
have
made
their
own
mythology
and
allegory
the
mythology
drops
for
the
most
part
very
early
out
of
practical
religion
even
in
homer
we
find
it
expurgated
in
pindar
aeschylus
and
xenophanes
it
is
expurgated
denied
and
allegorized
the
myths
survive
chiefly
as
material
for
literature
the
shapes
of
the
gods
themselves
chiefly
as
material
for
art
they
are
both
of
them
objects
not
of
belief
but
of
imagination
yet
when
the
religious
imagination
of
greece
deepens
it
twines
itself
still
around
these
gracious
and
shapes
the
zeus
of
aeschylus
moves
on
into
the
zeus
of
plato
or
of
cleanthes
or
of
marcus
aurelius
hermes
athena
apollo
all
have
their
long
spiritual
history
they
are
but
little
impeded
by
the
echoes
of
the
old
frivolous
mythology
still
less
by
any
local
roots
or
sectional
prejudices
or
compulsory
details
of
ritual
as
the
more
highly
educated
mind
of
greece
emerged
from
a
particular
local
tribal
conception
of
religion
the
old
denationalized
olympians
were
ready
to
receive
her
the
real
religion
of
the
fifth
century
was
as
we
have
said
a
devotion
to
the
city
itself
it
is
expressed
often
in
aeschylus
and
sophocles
again
and
again
with
more
discord
and
more
criticism
in
euripides
and
plato
for
the
indignant
blasphemies
of
the
gorgias
and
the
troades
bear
the
same
message
as
the
ideal
patriotism
of
the
republic
it
is
expressed
best
perhaps
and
that
without
mention
of
the
name
of
a
single
god
in
the
great
funeral
speech
of
pericles
it
is
higher
than
most
modern
patriotism
because
it
is
set
upon
higher
ideals
it
is
more
fervid
because
the
men
practising
it
lived
habitually
nearer
to
the
and
when
they
spoke
of
dying
for
the
city
spoke
of
a
thing
they
had
faced
last
week
and
might
face
again
it
was
more
religious
because
of
the
unconscious
mysticism
in
which
it
is
clothed
even
by
such
hard
heads
as
pericles
and
thucydides
the
mysticism
of
men
in
the
presence
of
some
fact
for
which
they
have
no
words
great
enough
yet
for
all
its
intensity
it
was
condemned
by
its
mere
narrowness
by
the
fourth
century
the
average
athenian
must
have
recognized
what
philosophers
had
recognized
long
before
that
a
religion
to
be
true
must
be
universal
and
not
the
privilege
of
a
particular
people
as
soon
as
the
stoics
had
proclaimed
the
world
to
be
great
city
of
gods
and
men
the
only
gods
with
which
greece
could
satisfactorily
people
that
city
were
the
idealized
band
of
the
old
olympians
they
are
artists
dreams
ideals
allegories
they
are
symbols
of
something
beyond
themselves
they
are
gods
of
tradition
of
unconscious
of
aspiration
they
are
gods
to
whom
doubtful
philosophers
can
pray
with
all
a
philosopher
due
caution
as
to
so
many
radiant
and
hypotheses
they
are
not
gods
in
whom
any
one
believes
as
a
hard
fact
does
this
condemn
them
or
is
it
just
the
other
way
is
it
perhaps
that
one
difference
between
religion
and
superstition
lies
exactly
in
this
that
superstition
degrades
its
worship
by
turning
its
beliefs
into
so
many
statements
of
brute
fact
on
which
it
must
needs
act
without
question
without
striving
without
any
respect
for
others
or
any
desire
for
higher
or
fuller
truth
it
is
only
an
accident
though
perhaps
an
invariable
accident
that
all
the
supposed
facts
are
false
in
religion
however
precious
you
may
consider
the
truth
you
draw
from
it
you
know
that
it
is
a
truth
seen
dimly
and
possibly
seen
by
others
better
than
by
you
you
know
that
all
your
creeds
and
definitions
are
merely
metaphors
attempts
to
use
human
language
for
a
purpose
for
which
it
was
never
made
your
concepts
are
by
the
nature
of
things
inadequate
the
truth
is
not
in
you
but
beyond
you
a
thing
not
conquered
but
still
to
be
pursued
something
like
this
i
take
it
was
the
character
of
the
olympian
religion
in
the
higher
minds
of
later
greece
its
gods
could
awaken
man
worship
and
strengthen
his
higher
aspirations
but
at
heart
they
knew
themselves
to
be
only
metaphors
as
the
most
beautiful
image
carved
by
man
was
not
the
god
but
only
a
symbol
to
help
towards
conceiving
the
god
so
the
god
himself
when
conceived
was
not
the
reality
but
only
a
symbol
to
help
towards
conceiving
the
reality
that
was
the
work
set
before
them
meantime
they
issued
no
creeds
that
contradicted
knowledge
no
commands
that
made
man
sin
against
his

the
great
schools
of
the
fourth
century
there
is
a
passage
in
xenophon
describing
how
one
summer
night
in
people
in
athens
heard
a
cry
of
wailing
an
making
its
way
up
between
the
long
walls
from
the
piraeus
and
coming
nearer
and
nearer
as
they
listened
it
was
the
news
of
the
final
disaster
of
kynoskephalai
brought
at
midnight
to
the
piraeus
by
the
galley
paralos
that
night
no
one
slept
they
wept
for
the
dead
but
far
more
bitterly
for
themselves
when
they
reflected
what
things
they
had
done
to
the
people
of
mÃªlos
when
taken
by
siege
to
the
people
of
histiaea
and
skÃ®onÃª
and
torÃ´nÃª
and
aegÃ®na
and
many
more
of
the
hellenes
the
echo
of
that
lamentation
seems
to
ring
behind
most
of
the
literature
of
the
fourth
century

not
the
athenian
literature

defeat
can
on
occasion

men
their

even
their
pride

it
did

in

after
the
chremonidean
war
in
not
to
speak
of

but
the
defeat
of
not
only
left
athens
at
the
mercy
of
her
enemies
it
stripped
her
of
those
things
of
which
she
had
been
inwardly
most
proud
her
her
high
civilization
her
leadership
of
all
that
was
most
hellenic
in
hellas
the
of
pericles
had
become
a
tyrant
her
nature
poisoned
by
war
her
government
a
in
greece
for
brutality
and
greece
as
a
whole
felt
the
tragedy
of
it
it
is
curious
how
this
defeat
of
athens
by
sparta
seems
to
have
been
felt
abroad
as
a
defeat
for
greece
itself
and
for
the
hopes
of
the
greek
city
state
the
fall
of
athens
mattered
more
than
the
victory
of
lysander
neither
sparta
nor
any
other
city
ever
attempted
to
take
her
place
and
no
writer
after
the
year
speaks
of
any
other
city
as
pericles
used
to
speak
of
athens
not
even
polybius
years
later
when
he
stands
amazed
before
the
solidity
and
the
of
rome
the
city

the
polis
had
concentrated

itself
almost
all
the
loyalty

the
aspirations
of
the
greek
mind
it
gave
security
to
life
it
gave
meaning
to
religion
and
in
the
fall
of
athens
it
had
failed
in
the
third
century
when
things
begin
to
recover
we
find
on
the
one
hand
the
great
military
monarchies
of
alexander
successors
and
on
the
other
a
number
of
federations
of
tribes
which
were
generally
strongest
in
the
backward
regions
where
the
city
state
had
been
least
developed

had
become
more
important
than
athens
or
corinth
and
sparta
was
only
strong
by
means
of
a
league
by
that
time
the
polis
was
recognized
as
a
comparatively
weak
social
organism
capable
of
very
high
culture
but
not
quite
able
as
the

of
the

of

expresses
it

its
own
under
the
strenuous
conditions
of
modern
life
besides
it
was
not
now
ruled
by
the
best
citizens
the
best
had
turned
away
from
politics
this
great
discouragement
did
not
take
place
at
a
blow
among
the
practical
statesmen
probably
most
did
not
form
any
theory
about
the
cause
of
the
failure
but
went
on
as
practical
statesmen
must
doing
as
best
they
could
from
difficulty
to
difficulty
but
many
saw
that
the
fatal
danger
to
greece
was
disunion
as
many
see
it
in
europe
now
when
macedon
proved
indisputably
stronger
than
athens
isocrates
urged
philip
to
accept
the
leadership
of
greece
against
the
barbarian
and
against
barbarism
he
might
thus
both
unite
the
greek
cities
and
also
evangelize
the
world
lysias
the
democratic
and
orator
had
been
groping
for
a
similar
solution
as
early
as
and
was
prepared
to
make
an
even
sharper
sacrifice
for
it
he
appealed
at
olympia
for
a
crusade
of
all
the
free
greek
cities
against
dionysius
of
syracuse
and
begged
sparta
herself
to
lead
it
the
spartans
are
right
the
leaders
of
hellas
by
their
natural
nobleness
and
their
skill
in
war
they
alone
live
still
in
a
city
unsacked
unwalled
unconquered
uncorrupted
by
faction
and
have
followed
always
the
same
modes
of
life
they
have
been
the
saviours
of
hellas
in
the
past
and
one
may
hope
that
their
freedom
will
be
everlasting
a
great
and
generous
change
in
one
who
had
by
suffering
in
the
peloponnesian
war
others
no
doubt
merely
gave
their
submission
to
the
stronger
powers
that
were
now
rising
there
were
openings
for
counsellors
for
mercenary
soldiers
for
court
savants
and
philosophers
and
poets
and
of
course
for
agents
in
every
free
city
who
were
prepared
for
one
motive
or
another
not
to
kick
against
the
pricks
and
there
were
always
also
those
who
had
neither
learned
nor
forgotten
the
unrepentant
idealists
too
passionate
or
too
heroic
or
as
some
will
say
too
blind
to
abandon
their
devotion
to
or
to
because
the
world
considered
such
ideals
out
of
date
they
could
look
the
ruined
athenians
in
the
face
after
the
lost
battle
and
say
with
demosthenes

it
can
not
be
that
you
did
wrong
it
can
not
be
but
in
practical
politics
the
currents
of
thought
are
inevitably
limited
it
is
in
philosophy
and
speculation
that
we
find
the
richest
and
most
varied
reaction
to
the
great
failure
it
takes
different
shapes
in
those
writers
like
plato
and
xenophon
who
were
educated
in
the
fifth
century
and
had
once
believed
in
the
great
city
and
those
whose
whole
thinking
life
belonged
to
the
time
of
disillusion
plato
was
disgusted
with
democracy
and
with
athens
but
he
retained
his
faith
in
the
city
if
only
the
city
could
be
set
on
the
right
road
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
he
attributes
to
the
bad
government
of
the
demos
many
evils
which
were
really
due
to
extraneous
causes
or
to
the
mere
fallibility
of
human
nature
still
his
analysis
of
democracy
is
one
of
the
most
brilliant
things
in
the
history
of
political
theory
it
is
so
acute
so
humorous
so
affectionate
and
at
many
different
ages
of
the
world
has
seemed
like
a
portrait
of
the
actual
contemporary
society
like
a
modern
popular
newspaper
plato
democracy
makes
it
its
business
to
satisfy
existing
desires
and
give
people
a
time
it
does
not
distinguish
between
higher
and
lower
any
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
and
so
is
any
impulse
or
any
idea
consequently
the
commoner
have
the
pull
even
the
great
democratic
statesmen
of
the
past
he
now
sees
have
been
ministers
to
mob
desires
they
have
the
city
with
harbours
and
docks
and
walls
and
revenues
and
trash
without
sophrosynÃª
and
righteousness
the
sage
or
saint
has
no
place
in
practical
politics
he
would
be
like
a
man
in
a
den
of
wild
beasts
let
him
and
his
like
seek
shelter
as
best
they
can
standing
up
behind
some
wall
while
the
storm
of
dust
and
sleet
rages
past
the
world
does
not
want
truth
which
is
all
that
he
could
give
it
it
goes
by
appearances
and
judges
its
great
men
with
their
clothes
on
and
their
rich
relations
round
them
after
death
the
judges
will
judge
them
naked
and
alone
and
then
we
shall
see
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
the
child
of
the
fifth
century
can
not
keep
his
mind
from
politics
the
speculations
which
would
be
scouted
by
the
mass
in
the
marketplace
can
still
be
discussed
with
intimate
friends
and
disciples
or
written
in
books
for
the
wise
to
read
plato
two
longest
works
are
attempts
to
construct
an
ideal
society
first
what
may
be
called
a
city
of
righteousness
in
the
and
afterwards
in
his
old
age
in
the
something
more
like
a
city
of
refuge
uncontaminated
by
the
world
a
little
city
on
a
away
in
crete
remote
from
commerce
and
riches
and
the
and
corrupting
which
carries
them
a
city
where
life
shall
move
in
music
and
discipline
and
reverence
for
the
things
that
are
greater
than
man
and
the
songs
men
sing
shall
be
not
common
songs
but
the
preambles
of
the
city
laws
showing
their
purpose
and
their
principle
where
no
wall
will
be
needed
to
keep
out
the
possible
enemy
because
the
courage
and
temperance
of
the
citizens
will
be
wall
enough
and
if
war
comes
the
women
equally
with
the
men
fight
for
their
young
as
birds
do
this
hope
is
very
like
despair
but
such
as
it
is
plato
thought
is
always
directed
towards
the
city
no
other
form
of
social
life
ever
tempts
him
away
and
he
anticipates
no
insuperable
difficulty
in
keeping
the
city
in
the
right
path
if
once
he
can
get
it
started
right
the
first
step
the
necessary
revolution
is
what
makes
the
difficulty
and
he
sees
only
one
way
in
real
life
he
had
supported
the
conspiracy
of
the
extreme
oligarchs
in
which
led
to
the
rule
of
the
tyrants
but
the
experience
sickened
him
of
such
methods
there
was
no
hope
unless
by
some
lucky
combination
a
philosopher
should
become
a
king
or
some
young
king
turn
philosopher
me
a
city
governed
by
a
tyrant
he
says
in
the
let
the
tyrant
be
young
with
a
good
memory
quick
at
learning
of
high
courage
and
a
generous
nature
and
besides
let
him
have
a
wise
counsellor
ironical
fortune
granted
him
an
opportunity
to
try
the
experiment
himself
at
the
court
of
syracuse
first
with
the
elder
and
then
twenty
years
later
with
the
younger
dionysius
and
it
is
a
story
of
disappointment
of
course
bitter
humiliating
and
ludicrous
disappointment
but
with
a
touch
of
that
sublimity
which
seems
so
often
to
hang
about
the
errors
of
the
wise
one
can
study
them
in
seneca
at
the
court
of
nero
or
in
turgot
with
louis
not
so
well
perhaps
in
voltaire
with
frederick
plato
failed
in
his
enterprise
but
he
did
keep
faith
with
the
city
another
of
the
socratic
circle
turned
in
a
different
direction
xenophon
an
exile
from
his
country
a
brilliant
soldier
and
adventurer
as
well
as
a
man
of
letters
is
perhaps
the
first
greek
on
record
who
openly
lost
interest
in
the
city
he
thought
less
about
cities
and
constitutions
than
about
great
men
and
nations
or
generals
and
armies
to
him
it
was
idle
to
spin
cobweb
formations
of
ideal
laws
and
communities
society
is
right
enough
if
you
have
a
really
fine
man
to
lead
it
it
may
be
that
his
ideal
was
formed
in
childhood
by
stories
of
pericles
and
the
great
age
when
athens
was
name
a
democracy
but
in
truth
an
empire
of
one
leading
man
he
gave
form
to
his
dream
in
the
of
an
imaginary
account
of
the
training
which
formed
cyrus
the
great
into
an
ideal
king
and
soldier
the
is
said
to
have
been
intended
as
a
counterblast
to
plato
and
it
may
have
provoked
plato
casual
remark
in
the
that
never
so
much
as
touched
education
no
doubt
the
book
suffered
in
persuasiveness
from
being
so
obviously
fictitious
for
example
the
cyrus
of
xenophon
dies
peacefully
in
his
bed
after
much
affectionate
and
edifying
advice
to
his
family
whereas
all
athens
knew
from
herodotus
how
the
real
cyrus
had
been
killed
in
a
war
against
the
massagetae
and
his
head
to
slake
its
thirst
for
that
liquid
plunged
into
a
wineskin
full
of
human
blood
perhaps
also
the
monarchical
rule
of
cyrus
was
too
absolute
for
greek
taste
at
any
rate
later
on
xenophon
adopted
a
more
real
hero
whom
he
had
personally
known
and
admired
agesilaus
king
of
sparta
had
been
taken
as
a
type
of
even
by
the
bitter
historian
theopompus
agesilaus
was
not
only
a
great
general
he
knew
how
to
the
gods
do
his
duty
in
the
field
and
to
practise
obedience
he
was
true
to
friend
and
foe
on
one
memorable
occasion
he
kept
his
word
even
to
an
enemy
who
had
broken
his
he
enjoined
kindness
to
enemy
captives
when
he
found
small
children
left
behind
by
the
barbarians
in
some
town
that
he
occupied
because
either
their
parents
or
the
had
no
room
for
them
he
always
took
care
of
them
or
gave
them
to
guardians
of
their
own
race
never
let
the
dogs
and
wolves
get
them
on
the
other
hand
when
he
sold
his
barbarian
prisoners
he
sent
them
to
market
naked
regardless
of
their
modesty
because
it
cheered
his
own
soldiers
to
see
how
white
and
fat
they
were
he
wept
when
he
won
a
victory
over
greeks
he
loved
all
greeks
and
only
hated
barbarians
when
he
returned
home
after
his
successful
campaigns
he
obeyed
the
orders
of
the
ephors
without
question
his
house
and
furniture
were
as
simple
as
those
of
a
common
man
and
his
daughter
the
princess
when
she
went
to
and
fro
to
amyclae
went
simply
in
the
public
omnibus
he
reared
chargers
and
hunting
dogs
the
rearing
of
chariot
horses
he
thought
effeminate
but
he
advised
his
sister
cynisca
about
hers
and
she
won
the
chariot
race
at
olympia
a
king
like
that
says
xenophon
all
will
be
well
he
will
govern
right
he
will
beat
your
enemies
and
he
will
set
an
example
of
good
life
if
you
want
virtue
in
the
state
look
for
it
in
a
good
man
not
in
a
speculative
tangle
of
laws
the
spartan
constitution
as
it
stands
is
good
enough
for
any
one
but
it
was
another
of
the
great
socratics
who
uttered
first
the
characteristic
message
of
the
fourth
century
and
met
the
blows
of
fortune
with
a
direct
challenge
antisthenes
was
a
man
twenty
years
older
than
plato
he
had
fought
at
tanagra
in
he
had
been
friends
with
gorgias
and
prodicus
the
great
sophists
of
the
periclean
age
he
seems
to
have
been
at
any
rate
till
younger
and
more
brilliant
men
cut
him
out
the
recognized
philosophic
heir
of
socrates
and
late
in
life
after
the
fall
of
athens
and
the
condemnation
and
death
of
his
master
the
man
underwent
a
curious
change
of
heart
he
is
taunted
more
than
once
with
the
lateness
of
his
discovery
of
truth
and
with
his
childish
subservience
to
the
old
of
the
sceptics
which
professed
to
prove
the
impossibility
of
knowledge
it
seems
that
he
had
lost
faith
in
speculation
and
dialectic
and
the
elaborate
superstructures
which
plato
and
others
had
built
upon
them
and
he
felt
like
many
moralists
after
him
a
sort
of
hostility
to
all
knowledge
that
was
not
immediately
convertible
into
conduct
but
this
scepticism
was
only
part
of
a
general
disbelief
in
the
world
greek
philosophy
had
from
the
first
been
concerned
with
a
fundamental
question
which
we
moderns
seldom
put
clearly
to
ourselves
it
asked
is
the
good
meaning
thereby
is
the
element
of
value
in
life
or
should
be
our
chief
aim
in
living
a
medieval
christian
would
have
answered
without
hesitation
go
to
heaven
and
not
be
damned
and
would
have
been
prepared
with
the
necessary
prescriptions
for
attaining
that
end
but
the
modern
world
is
not
intensely
enough
convinced
of
the
reality
of
sin
and
judgement
hell
and
heaven
to
accept
this
answer
as
an
authoritative
guide
in
life
and
has
not
clearly
thought
out
any
other
the
ancient
greek
spent
a
great
part
of
his
philosophical
activity
in
trying
without
propounding
supernatural
rewards
and
punishments
or
at
least
without
laying
stress
on
them
to
think
out
what
the
good
of
man
really
was
the
answers
given
by
mankind
to
this
question
seem
to
fall
under
two
main
heads
before
a
battle
if
both
parties
were
asked
what
aim
they
were
pursuing
both
would
say
without
hesitation
after
the
battle
the
conqueror
would
probably
say
that
his
purpose
was
in
some
way
to
consolidate
or
extend
his
victory
but
the
beaten
party
as
soon
as
he
had
time
to
think
would
perhaps
explain
that
after
all
victory
was
not
everything
it
was
better
to
have
fought
for
the
right
to
have
done
your
best
and
to
have
failed
than
to
revel
in
the
prosperity
of
the
unjust
and
since
it
is
difficult
to
maintain
in
the
midst
of
the
triumph
of
the
enemy
and
your
own
obvious
misery
and
humiliation
that
all
is
well
and
you
yourself
thoroughly
contented
this
second
answer
easily
develops
a
third
a
little
till
god
judgement
asserts
itself
and
see
who
has
the
best
of
it
then
there
will
be
a
rich
reward
hereafter
for
the
suffering
virtuous
the
typical
athenian
of
the
periclean
age
would
have
been
in
the
first
state
of
mind
his
would
be
in
the
nature
of
success
to
spread
justice
and
freedom
to
make
athens
happy
and
strong
and
her
laws
wise
and
equal
for
rich
and
poor
antisthenes
had
fallen
violently
into
the
second
he
was
defeated
together
with
all
that
he
most
cared
for
and
he
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
that
nothing
matters
except
to
have
done
your
best
as
he
phrased
it
is
the
aretÃª
meaning
or
the
quality
of
a
good
citizen
a
good
father
a
good
dog
a
good
sword
the
things
of
the
world
are
vanity
and
philosophy
as
vain
as
the
rest
nothing
but
goodness
is
good
and
the
first
step
towards
attaining
it
is
to
repent
there
was
in
athens
a
gymnasium
built
for
those
who
were
and
could
not
attend
the
gymnasia
of
true
citizens
it
was
called
kynosarges
and
was
dedicated
to
the
great
bastard
heracles
antisthenes
though
he
had
moved
hitherto
in
the
somewhat
patrician
circle
of
the
socratics
remembered
how
that
his
mother
was
a
thracian
slave
and
set
up
his
school
in
kynosarges
among
the
disinherited
of
the
earth
he
made
friends
with
the
who
needed
befriending
he
dressed
like
the
poorest
workman
he
would
accept
no
disciples
except
those
who
could
bear
hardship
and
was
apt
to
drive
away
with
his
stick
yet
he
also
preached
in
the
streets
both
in
athens
and
corinth
he
preached
rhetorically
with
parables
and
vivid
emotional
phrases
compelling
the
attention
of
the
crowd
his
eloquence
was
held
to
be
bad
style
and
it
started
the
form
of
literature
known
to
the
cynics
as
ÏÏÎµá½·Î±
help
or
Î´Î¹Î±ÏÏÎ¹Î²á½µ
study
and
by
the
christians
as
á½Î¼Î¹Î»á½·Î±
a
or
sermon
this
passionate
and
ascetic
old
man
would
have
attracted
the
interest
of
the
world
even
more
had
it
not
been
for
one
of
his
disciples
this
was
a
young
man
from
sinope
on
the
euxine
whom
he
did
not
take
to
at
first
sight
the
son
of
a
disreputable
who
had
been
sent
to
prison
for
defacing
the
coinage
antisthenes
ordered
the
lad
away
but
he
paid
no
attention
he
beat
him
with
his
stick
but
he
never
moved
he
wanted
and
saw
that
antisthenes
had
it
to
give
his
aim
in
life
was
to
do
as
his
father
had
done
to
the
coinage
but
on
a
much
larger
scale
he
would
deface
all
the
coinage
current
in
the
world
every
conventional
stamp
was
false
the
men
stamped
as
generals
and
kings
the
things
stamped
as
honour
and
wisdom
and
happiness
and
riches
all
were
base
metal
with
lying
superscriptions
all
must
have
the
stamp
defaced
this
young
man
was
diogenes
afterwards
the
most
famous
of
all
the
cynics
he
started
by
rejecting
all
stamps
and
superscriptions
and
holding
that
nothing
but
or
was
good
he
rejected
tradition
he
rejected
the
current
religion
and
the
rules
and
customs
of
temple
worship
true
religion
was
a
thing
of
the
spirit
and
needed
no
forms
he
despised
divination
he
rejected
civil
life
and
marriage
he
mocked
at
the
general
interest
in
the
public
games
and
the
respect
paid
to
birth
wealth
or
reputation
let
man
put
aside
these
delusions
and
know
himself
and
for
his
defences
let
him
arm
himself
fortune
with
courage
against
convention
with
nature
against
passion
with
reason
for
reason
is
god
within
us
the
salvation
for
man
was
to
return
to
nature
and
diogenes
interpreted
this
return
in
the
simplest
and
crudest
way
he
should
live
like
the
beasts
like
primeval
men
like
barbarians
were
not
the
beasts
blessed
á¿¥Îµá¿Î±
Î¶á½½Î¿Î½ÏÎµÏ
like
the
gods
in
homer
and
so
though
in
less
perfection
were
primitive
men
not
vexing
their
hearts
with
imaginary
sins
and
conventions
travellers
told
of
savages
who
married
their
sisters
or
ate
human
flesh
or
left
their
dead
unburied
why
should
they
not
if
they
wished
to
no
wonder
zeus
punished
prometheus
the
who
had
brought
all
this
progress
upon
us
and
left
man
civilized
and
more
unhappy
than
any
beast
he
deserved
his
crag
and
his
vulture
diogenes
took
his
mission
with
great
earnestness
he
was
leader
in
a
battle
against
pleasures
and
desires
he
was
servant
the
sent
by
zeus
of
mankind
and
the
of
passions
the
life
that
he
personally
meant
to
live
and
which
he
recommended
to
the
wise
was
what
he
called
Ïá½¸Î½
ÎºÏÎ½Î¹Îºá½¸Î½
Î²á½·Î¿Î½
dog
life
and
he
himself
wished
to
be
a
or
a
dog
was
brave
and
faithful
it
had
no
bodily
shame
no
false
theories
and
few
wants
a
dog
needed
no
clothes
no
house
no
city
no
possessions
no
titles
what
he
did
need
was
aretÃª
to
catch
his
prey
to
fight
wild
beasts
and
to
defend
his
master
and
that
he
could
provide
for
himself
diogenes
found
of
course
that
he
needed
a
little
more
than
an
ordinary
dog
a
blanket
a
wallet
or
bowl
to
hold
his
food
and
a
staff
a
beat
off
dogs
and
bad
men
it
was
the
regular
uniform
of
a
beggar
he
asked
for
no
house
there
was
a
huge
earthen
pitcher
not
a
tub
outside
the
temple
of
the
great
mother
the
sort
of
vessel
that
was
used
for
burial
in
primitive
greece
and
which
still
had
about
it
the
associations
of
a
coffin
diogenes
slept
there
when
he
wanted
shelter
and
it
became
the
nearest
approach
to
a
home
that
he
had
like
a
dog
he
performed
any
bodily
act
without
shame
when
and
where
he
chose
he
obeyed
no
human
laws
because
he
recognized
no
city
he
was
citizen
of
the
universe
all
men
and
all
beasts
too
were
his
brothers
he
lived
preaching
in
the
streets
and
begging
his
bread
except
that
he
did
not
he
other
folk
obeyed
his
commands
because
they
were
still
slaves
while
he
never
been
a
slave
again
since
antisthenes
set
him
free
he
had
no
fear
because
there
was
nothing
to
take
from
him
only
slaves
are
afraid
greece
rang
with
stories
of
his
mordant
wit
and
every
bitter
saying
became
fathered
on
diogenes
every
one
knew
how
alexander
the
great
had
come
to
see
the
famous
beggar
and
standing
before
him
where
he
sat
in
the
open
air
had
asked
if
there
was
any
boon
he
could
confer
on
him
move
from
between
me
and
the
sun
they
knew
the
king
saying
i
were
not
alexander
i
would
be
diogenes
and
the
polite
answer
i
were
not
diogenes
i
would
be
alexander
the
master
of
the
world
and
the
rejector
of
the
world
met
on
an
equality
people
told
too
how
the
cynic
walked
about
with
a
lamp
in
the
daytime
searching
so
he
said
a
man
they
knew
his
scorn
of
the
mysteries
with
their
doctrine
of
exclusive
salvation
was
a
thief
to
be
in
bliss
because
he
was
initiated
while
agesilaus
and
epaminondas
were
in
outer
darkness
a
few
of
the
stories
are
more
whimsical
a
workman
carrying
a
pole
accidentally
hit
diogenes
and
cried
out
said
he
you
going
to
hit
me
again
he
had
rejected
patriotism
as
he
rejected
culture
yet
he
suffered
as
he
saw
greece
under
the
macedonians
and
greek
liberties
disappearing
when
his
death
was
approaching
some
disciple
asked
his
wishes
about
his
burial
the
dogs
and
wolves
have
me
he
said
should
like
to
be
of
some
use
to
my
brothers
when
i
die
when
this
request
was
refused
his
thoughts
turned
again
to
the
macedonian
wars
me
face
downwards
everything
is
soon
going
to
be
turned
the
other
way
up
he
remains
the
permanent
and
unsurpassed
type
of
one
way
of
grappling
with
the
horror
of
life
fear
nothing
desire
nothing
possess
nothing
and
then
life
with
all
its
ingenuity
of
malice
can
not
disappoint
you
if
man
can
not
enter
into
life
nor
yet
depart
from
it
save
through
agony
and
filth
let
him
learn
to
endure
the
one
and
be
indifferent
to
the
other
the
watchdog
of
zeus
on
earth
has
to
fulfil
his
special
duty
to
warn
mankind
of
the
truth
and
to
set
slaves
free
nothing
else
matters
the
criticism
of
this
solution
is
not
that
it
is
selfish
it
is
not
the
cynic
lives
for
the
salvation
of
his
fellow
creatures
and
it
is
worth
remembering
that
before
the
roman
gladiatorial
games
were
eventually
stopped
by
the
of
the
monk
telemachus
two
cynic
philosophers
had
thrown
themselves
into
the
arena
in
the
same
spirit
its
weakness
lies
in
a
false
psychology
common
to
all
the
world
at
that
time
which
imagined
that
salvation
or
freedom
consists
in
living
utterly
without
desire
or
fear
that
such
a
life
is
biologically
possible
and
that
diogenes
lived
it
to
a
subtler
critic
it
is
obvious
that
diogenes
was
a
man
of
very
strong
and
successful
ambitions
though
his
ambitions
were
different
from
those
of
most
men
he
solved
the
problem
of
his
own
life
by
following
with
all
the
force
and
courage
of
his
genius
a
line
of
conduct
which
made
him
next
to
alexander
the
most
famous
man
in
greece
to
be
really
without
fear
or
desire
would
mean
death
and
to
die
is
not
to
solve
the
riddle
of
living
the
difference
between
the
cynic
view
of
life
and
that
of
is
interesting
plato
also
rejected
the
most
fundamental
conventions
of
existing
society
the
accepted
methods
of
government
the
laws
of
property
and
of
marriage
the
traditional
religion
and
even
the
poetry
which
was
a
second
religion
to
the
greeks
but
he
rejected
the
existing
culture
only
because
he
wanted
it
to
be
better
he
condemned
the
concrete
existing
city
in
order
to
build
a
more
perfect
city
to
proceed
in
infinite
searching
and
longing
towards
the
idea
of
good
the
sun
of
the
spiritual
universe
diogenes
rejected
the
civilization
which
he
saw
and
admitted
the
reality
of
no
other
his
crude
realistic
attitude
of
mind
had
no
use
for
plato
can
see
a
table
he
said
can
not
see
tabularity

know
athens
and
corinth
and
other
cities
and
can
see
that
they
are
all
bad
as
for
the
ideal
society
show
it
me
and
i
will
say
what
i
think
in
spite
of
its
false
psychology
the
cynic
conception
of
life
had
a
great
effect
in
greece
it
came
almost
as
a
revelation
to
both
men
and
women
and
profoundly
influenced
all
the
schools
here
indeed
it
seemed
was
a
way
to
baffle
fortune
and
to
make
one
own
soul
unafraid
what
men
wanted
was
Ïá½¸
Î¸Î±ÏÏÎµá¿Î½
be
of
good
cheer
as
we
say
now
to
regain
their
after
bewildering
defeats
the
cynic
answer
afterwards
corrected
and
humanized
by
the
stoics
was
to
look
at
life
as
a
long
and
arduous
campaign
the
loyal
soldier
does
not
trouble
about
his
comfort
or
his
rewards
or
his
pleasures
he
obeys
his
orders
without
fear
or
failing
whether
they
lead
to
easy
victories
or
merely
to
wounds
captivity
or
death
only
goodness
is
good
and
for
the
soldier
goodness
á¼ÏÎµÏá½µ
is
the
doing
of
duty
that
is
his
true
prize
which
no
external
power
can
take
away
from
him
but
after
all
what
is
duty
diogenes
preached
and
assumed
that
his
way
of
life
was
but
was
it
really
so
and
if
so
on
what
evidence
to
live
like
a
beast
to
be
indifferent
to
art
beauty
letters
science
philosophy
to
the
amenities
of
civic
life
to
all
that
raised
hellenic
man
above
the
beast
or
the
savage
how
could
this
be
the
true
end
of
man
the
stoic
school
whose
founder
zeno
was
a
disciple
of
old
antisthenes
gradually
built
up
a
theory
of
moral
life
which
has
on
the
whole
weathered
the
storms
of
time
with
great
success
it
largely
dominated
later
antiquity
by
its
imaginative
and
emotional
power
it
gave
form
to
the
aspirations
of
early
christianity
it
lasts
now
as
the
nearest
approach
to
an
acceptable
system
of
conduct
for
those
who
do
not
accept
revelation
but
still
keep
some
faith
in
the
purpose
of
things
the
problem
is
to
combine
the
absolute
value
of
that
goodness
which
as
we
say
the
soul
with
the
relative
values
of
the
various
good
things
that
soothe
or
beautify
life
for
if
there
is
any
value
at
all
i
will
not
say
in
health
and
happiness
but
in
art
poetry
knowledge
refinement
public
esteem
or
human
affection
and
if
their
claims
do
clash
as
in
common
opinion
they
sometimes
do
with
the
demands
of
absolute
sanctity
how
is
the
balance
to
be
struck
are
we
to
be
content
with
the
principle
of
accepting
a
little
moral
wrong
for
the
sake
of
much
material
or
artistic
or
intellectual
advantage
that
is
the
rule
which
the
practical
world
follows
though
without
talking
about
it
but
the
stoics
would
have
none
of
any
such
compromise
zeno
first
like
antisthenes
denied
any
value
whatever
to
these
earthly
things
that
are
not
virtue
to
health
or
sickness
riches
or
poverty
beauty
or
ugliness
pain
or
pleasure
who
would
ever
mention
them
when
the
soul
stood
naked
before
god
all
that
would
then
matter
and
consequently
all
that
can
ever
matter
is
the
goodness
of
the
self
that
is
of
his
free
and
living
will
the
stoics
improved
on
the
military
metaphor
for
to
the
soldier
after
all
it
does
matter
whether
in
his
part
of
the
field
he
wins
or
loses
life
is
not
like
a
battle
but
like
a
play
in
which
god
has
handed
each
man
his
part
unread
and
the
good
man
proceeds
to
act
it
to
the
best
of
his
power
not
knowing
what
may
happen
in
the
last
scene
he
may
become
a
crowned
king
he
may
be
a
slave
dying
in
torment
what
matters
it
the
good
actor
can
play
either
part
all
that
matters
is
that
he
shall
act
his
best
accept
the
order
of
the
cosmos
and
obey
the
purpose
of
the
great
dramaturge
the
answer
seems
absolute
and
unyielding
with
no
concession
to
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
yet
in
truth
it
contains
in
itself
the
germ
of
a
sublime
practical
compromise
which
makes
stoicism
human
it
accepts
the
cosmos
and
it
obeys
the
purpose
therefore
there
is
a
cosmos
and
there
is
a
purpose
in
the
world
stoicism
like
much
of
ancient
thought
at
this
period
was
permeated
by
the
new
discoveries
of
astronomy
and
their
formation
into
a
coherent
scientific
system
which
remained
unshaken
till
the
days
of
copernicus
the
stars
which
had
always
moved
men
wonder
and
even
worship
were
now
seen
and
proved
to
be
no
wandering
fires
but
parts
of
an
immense
and
apparently
eternal
order
one
star
might
differ
from
another
star
in
glory
but
they
were
all
alike
in
their
obedience
to
law
they
had
their
fixed
courses
divine
though
they
were
which
had
been
laid
down
for
them
by
a
being
greater
than
they
the
order
or
cosmos
was
a
proven
fact
therefore
the
purpose
was
a
proven
fact
and
though
in
its
completeness
inscrutable
it
could
at
least
in
part
be
divined
from
the
fact
that
all
these
varied
and
eternal
splendours
had
for
their
centre
our
earth
and
its
ephemeral
master
the
purpose
though
it
is
not
our
purpose
is
especially
concerned
with
us
and
circles
round
us
it
is
the
purpose
of
a
god
who
loves
man
let
us
forget
that
this
system
of
astronomy
has
been
overthrown
and
that
we
now
know
that
man
is
not
the
centre
of
the
universe
let
us
forget
that
the
majestic
order
which
reigns
or
seems
to
reign
among
the
stars
is
matched
by
a
brutal
conflict
and
a
chaos
of
jarring
purposes
in
the
realms
of
those
sciences
which
deal
with
life
if
we
can
recover
the
imaginative
outlook
of
the
generations
which
stretched
from
say
meton
in
the
fifth
century
before
christ
to
copernicus
in
the
sixteenth
after
we
shall
be
able
to
understand
the
spiritual
exaltation
with
which
men
like
zeno
or
poseidonius
regarded
the
world
we
are
part
of
an
order
a
cosmos
which
we
see
to
be
infinitely
above
our
comprehension
but
which
we
know
to
be
an
expression
of
love
for
man
what
can
we
do
but
accept
it
not
with
resignation
but
with
enthusiasm
and
offer
to
it
with
pride
any
sacrifice
which
it
may
demand
of
us
it
is
a
glory
to
suffer
for
such
an
end
and
there
is
more
for
the
stars
show
only
what
may
be
called
a
stationary
purpose
an
order
which
is
and
remains
for
ever
but
in
the
rest
of
the
world
we
can
see
a
moving
purpose
it
is
phusis
the
word
which
the
romans
unfortunately
translated
but
which
means
or
way
things
grow
almost
what
we
call
evolution
but
to
the
stoic
it
is
a
living
and
conscious
evolution
a
forethought
or
ÏÏá½¹Î½Î¿Î¹Î±
in
the
mind
of
god
what
the
romans
called
guiding
all
things
that
grow
in
a
direction
which
accords
with
the
divine
will
and
the
direction
the
stoic
pointed
out
was
not
towards
mere
happiness
but
towards
or
the
perfection
of
each
thing
or
each
species
after
its
kind
shapes
the
acorn
to
grow
into
the
perfect
oak
the
blind
puppy
into

to

it

if

a

it
is

true
the
things
that
he
produces
are
but
shadows
and
in
themselves
utterly
valueless
it
matters
not
one
straw
whether
the

goes
at
ten
miles
an

or
twenty
whether
the
population
of
a
city
die
this

of
famine
and
sickness
or
twenty
years
hence
of
old
age
but
it
belongs
to
the
good
governor
to
avert
famine
and
to
produce
healthy
conditions
as
it
belongs
to
the
deer
to
run
its
best
so
it
is
the
part
of
a
friend
if
need
arise
to
give
his
comfort
or
his
life
for
a
friend
of
a
mother
to
love
and
defend
her
children
though
it
is
true
that
in
the
light
of
eternity
these
affections
shrivel
into
their
native
worthlessness
if
the
will
of
god
is
done
and
done
willingly
all
is

you
may
if
it

you
great

you
may

i
will
say
no
more
of
this
great
body
of
teaching
as
i
have
dealt
with
it
in
a
separate
publication
but
i
would
point
out
two
special
advantages
of
a
psychological
kind
which
distinguish
stoicism
from
many
systems
of
philosophy
first
though
it
never
consciously
faced
the
psychological
problem
of
instinct
it
did
see
clearly
that
man
does
not
necessarily
pursue
what
pleases
him
most
or
what
is
most
profitable
to
him
or
even
his
it
saw
that
man
can
determine
his
end
and
may
well
choose
pain
in
preference
to
pleasure
this
saved
the
school
from
a
great
deal
of
that
false
schematization
which
besets
most
forms
of
rationalistic
psychology
secondly
it
did
build
up
a
system
of
thought
on
which
both
in
good
days
and
evil
a
life
can
be
lived
which
is
not
only
saintly
but
practically
wise
and
human
and
beneficent
it
did
for
practical
purposes
solve
the
problem
of
living
without
despair
and
without
grave
or
at
least
without
gross
illusion
the
other
great
school
of
the
fourth
century
a
school
which
in
the
matter
of
ethics
may
be
called
the
only
true
rival
of
stoicism
was
also
rooted
in
defeat
but
it
met
defeat
in
a
different
spirit
epicurus
son
of
neocles
of
the
old
athenian
clan
of
the
philaÃ¯dae
was
born
on
a
colony
in
samos
in
his
father
was
evidently
poor
else
he
would
hardly
have
left
athens
to
live
on
a
colonial
farm
nor
have
had
to
eke
out
his
farming
by
teaching
an
elementary
school
we
do
not
know
how
much
the
small
boy
learned
from
his
father
but
for
older
students
there
was
a
famous
school
on
the
neighbouring
island
of
teos
where
a
certain
nausiphanes
taught
the
ionian
tradition
of
mathematics
and
physics
as
well
as
rhetoric
and
literary
subjects
epicurus
went
to
this
school
when
he
was
fourteen
and
seems
among
other
things
to
have
imbibed
the
atomic
theory
of
democritus
without
realizing
that
it
was
anything
peculiar
he
felt
afterwards
as
if
his
had
been
merely
a
waste
of
time
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
went
to
athens
the
centre
of
the
philosophic
world
but
he
only
went
as
athenian
citizens
were
in
duty
bound
to
perform
his
year
of
military
service
as
study
was
to
come
later
the
next
year
however
perdiccas
of
thrace
made
an
attack
on
samos
and
drove
out
the
athenian
colonists
neocles
had
by
then
lived
on
his
bit
of
land
for
thirty
years
and
was
old
to
begin
life
again
the
ruined
family
took
refuge
in
colophon
and
there
epicurus
joined
them
they
were
now
too
poor
for
the
boy
to
go
abroad
to
study
philosophy
he
could
only
make
the
best
of
a
hard
time
and
puzzle
alone
over
the
problems
of
life
recent
years
have
taught
us
that
there
are
few
forms
of
misery
harder
than
that
endured
by
a
family
of
refugees
and
it
is
not
likely
to
have
been
easier
in
ancient
conditions
epicurus
built
up
his
philosophy
it
would
seem
while
helping
his
parents
and
brothers
through
this
bad
time
the
problem
was
how
to
make
the
life
of
their
little
colony
tolerable
and
he
somehow
solved
it
it
was
not
the
kind
of
problem
which
stoicism
and
the
great
religions
specially
set
themselves
it
was
at
once
too
unpretending
and
too
practical
one
can
easily
imagine
the
condition
for
which
he
had
to
prescribe
for
one
thing
the
unfortunate
refugees
all
about
him
would
torment
themselves
with
unnecessary
terrors
the
thracians
were
pursuing
them
the
gods
hated
them
they
must
obviously
have
committed
some
offence
or
impiety
it
is
always
easy
for
disheartened
men
to
discover
in
themselves
some
sin
that
deserves
punishment
it
would
surely
be
better
to
die
at
once
except
that
with
that
sin
upon
them
they
would
only
suffer
more
dreadfully
beyond
the
grave
in
their
distress
they
jarred
doubtless
on
one
another
nerves
and
mutual
bitterness
doubled
their
miseries
epicurus
is
said
to
have
had
poor
health
and
the
situation
was
one
where
even
the
best
health
would
be
sorely
tried
but
he
had
superhuman
courage
and
what
does
not
always
go
with
such
courage
a
very
affectionate
and
gentle
nature
in
later
life
all
his
three
brothers
were
his
devoted
disciples
a
testimonial
accorded
to
few
prophets
or
founders
of
religions
and
he
is
the
first
man
in
the
record
of
european
history
whose
mother
was
an
important
element
in
his
life
some
of
his
letters
to
her
have
been
preserved
and
show
a
touch
of
intimate
affection
which
of
course
must
have
existed
between
human
beings
from
the
remotest
times
but
of
which
we
possess
no
earlier
record
and
fragments
of
his
letters
to
his
friends
strike
the
same
note
his
first
discovery
was
that
men
torture
themselves
with
unnecessary
fears
he
must
teach
them
courage

to

no

from
either
man
or
god
god
is
a
blessed

and
no
blessed
being
either
suffers
evil
or
inflicts
evil
on
others
and
as
for
men
most
of
the
evils
you
fear
from
them
can
be
avoided
by
justice
and
if
they
do
come
they
can
be
borne
death
is
like
sleep
an
unconscious
state

be

pain
when
it
comes
can
be

it
is
the
anticipation
that
makes
men
miserable
and
saps
their
courage
the
refugees
were
forgotten
by
the
world
and
had
no
hope
of
any
great
change
in
their
condition
well
he
argued
so
much
the
better
let
them
till
the
earth
and
love
one
another
and
they
would
find
that
they
had
already
in
them
that
natural
happiness
which
is
man
possession
until
he
throws
it
away
and
of
all
things
that
contribute
to
happiness
the
greatest
is
affection
ÏÎ¹Î»á½·Î±
like
the
cynics
and
stoics
he
rejected
the
world
and
all
its
conventions
and
prizes
its
desires
and
passions
and
futility
but
where
the
stoic
and
cynic
proclaimed
that
in
spite
of
all
the
pain
and
suffering
of
a
wicked
world
man
can
by
the
force
of
his
own
will
be
virtuous
epicurus
brought
the
more
surprising
good
news
that
man
can
after
all
be
happy
but
to
make
this
good
news
credible
he
had
to
construct
a
system
of
thought
he
had
to
answer
the
temple
authorities
and
their
adherents
among
the
vulgar
who
threatened
his
followers
with
the
torments
of
hades
for
their
impiety
he
had
to
answer
the
stoics
and
cynics
preaching
that
all
is
worthless
except
aretÃª
and
the
sceptics
who
dwelt
on
the
fallibility
of
the
senses
and
the
logical
impossibility
of
knowledge
he
met
the
last
of
these
by
the
traditional
ionian
doctrine
of
ingeniously
developed
we
can
he
argued
know
the
outer
world
because
our
sense
impressions
are
literally
or
stamps
made
by
external
objects
upon
our
organs
to
see
for
instance
is
to
be
struck
by
an
infinitely
tenuous
stream
of
images
flowing
from
the
object
and
directly
impinging
upon
the
retina
such
streams
are
flowing
from
all
objects
in
every
direction
an
idea
which
seemed
incredible
until
the
modern
discoveries
about
light
sound
and
radiation
thus
there
is
direct
contact
with
reality
and
consequently
knowledge
besides
direct
vision
however
we
have
or
ÏÏÎ¿Î»á½µÏÎµÎ¹Ï
sometimes
called
conceptions
the
general
conception
which
we
have
of
a
horse
when
we
are
not
seeing
one
these
are
merely
the
result
of
repeated
acts
of
vision
a
curious
result
of
this
doctrine
was
that
all
our
or
ideas
are
true
mistakes
occur
through
some
interpretation
of
our
own
which
we
add
to
the
simple
sensation
we
can
know
the
world
how
then
are
we
to
understand
it
here
again
epicurus
found
refuge
in
the
old
ionian
theory
of
atoms
and
the
void
which
is
supposed
to
have
originated
with
democritus
and
leucippus
a
century
before
but
epicurus
seems
to
have
worked
out
the
atomic
theory
more
in
detail
as
we
have
it
expounded
in
lucretius
magnificent
poem
in
particular
it
was
possibly
he
who
first
combined
the
atomic
theory
with
hylozoism
he
conceived
of
the
atoms
as
possessing
some
rudimentary
power
of
movement
and
therefore
able
to
swerve
slightly
in
their
regular
downward
course
that
explains
how
they
have
become
infinitely
tangled
and
mingled
how
plants
and
animals
are
alive
and
how
men
have
free
will
it
also
enables
epicurus
to
build
up
a
world
without
the
assistance
of
a
god
he
set
man
free
as
lucretius
says
from
the
of
religion
though
his
doctrine
of
the
being
which
neither
has
pain
nor
gives
pain
enables
him
to
elude
the
dangerous
accusation
of
atheism
he
can
leave
people
believing
in
all
their
traditional
gods
including
even
if
so
they
wish
bearded
zeus
and
the
helmed
athena
which
they
see
in
dreams
and
in
their
ideas
while
at
the
same
time
having
no
fear
of
them
there
remains
the
foolish
fancy
of
the
cynics
and
stoics
that
is
the
only
good
of
course
he
answers
aretÃª
is
good
but
that
is
because
it
produces
happy
life
or
blessedness
or
pleasure
or
whatever
you
call
it
he
used
normally
the
word
á¼¡Î´Î¿Î½á½µ
and
counted
the
good
as
that
which
makes
life
sweet
he
seems
never
to
have
entered
into
small
disputes
as
to
the
difference
between
or
and
and
á¼¡Î´Î¿Î½á½µ
Îµá½Î´Î±Î¹Î¼Î¿Î½á½·Î±
Îµá½ÎµÏÏá½½
ÎºÏÎ»
though
sometimes
instead
of
he
spoke
of
Î¼Î±ÎºÎ±ÏÎ¹á½¹ÏÎ·Ï
ultimately
the
dispute
between
him
and
the
stoics
seems
to
resolve
itself
into
a
question
whether
the
good
lies
in
Ïá½±ÏÏÎµÎ¹Î½
or
ÏÎ¿Î¹Îµá¿Î½
in
experience
or
in
action
and
average
human
beings
seem
generally
to
think
that
the
good
for
a
conscious
being
must
be
something
of
which
he
is
conscious
thus
the
great
system
is
built
simple
intelligible
dogmatic
and
as
such
systems
go
remarkably
it
enables
man
to
be
unafraid
and
it
helps
him
to
be
happy
the
strange
thing
is
that
although
on
more
than
one
point
it
seems
to
anticipate
most
surprisingly
the
discoveries
of
modern
science
it
was
accepted
in
a
spirit
more
religious
than
scientific
as
we
can
see
from
lucretius
it
was
taken
almost
as
a
revelation
from
one
who
had
saved
mankind
whose
intellect
had
pierced
beyond
the
walls
of
heaven
and
brought
back
to
man
the
gospel
of
an
intelligible
universe
in
when
epicurus
was
things
had
so
far
improved
that
he
left
colophon
and
set
up
a
school
of
philosophy
in
mytilene
but
soon
moved
to
lampsacus
on
the
sea
of
marmora
where
he
had
friends
disciples
gathered
about
him
among
them
were
some
of
the
leading
men
of
the
city
like
leonteus
and
idomeneus
the
doctrine
thrilled
them
and
seemed
to
bring
freedom
with
it
they
felt
that
such
a
teacher
must
be
set
up
in
athens
the
home
of
the
great
philosophers
they
bought
by
subscription
a
house
and
garden
in
athens
for
minae
about
and
presented
it
to
the
master
he
crossed
to
athens
in
and
though
he
four
times
revisited
lampsacus
and
has
left
letters
addressed
friends
in
he
lived
in
the
famous
garden
for
the
rest
of
his
life
friends
from
lampsacus
and
elsewhere
came
and
lived
with
him
or
near
him
the
garden
was
not
only
a
philosophical
school
it
was
also
a
sort
of
retreat
or
religious
community
there
lived
there
not
only
philosophers
like
mÃªtrodÃ´rus
colÃ´tes
hermarchus
and
others
there
were
slaves
like
mys
and
free
women
like
themista
the
wife
of
leonteus
to
both
of
whom
the
master
as
the
extant
fragments
testify
wrote
letters
of
intimate
friendship
and
not
only
free
women
but
women
with
names
that
show
that
they
were
slaves
leontion
nikidion
mammarion
they
were
perhaps
victims
of
war
like
many
of
the
unfortunate
heroines
in
the
new
comedy
free
women
from
conquered
cities
who
had
been
sold
in
the
slave
market
or
reduced
to
misery
as
refugees
and
to
whom
now
the
garden
afforded
a
true
and
spiritual
refuge
for
almost
as
much
as
diogenes
epicurus
had
obliterated
the
stamp
on
the
conventional
currency
the
values
of
the
world
no
longer
held
good
after
you
had
passed
the
wicket
gate
of
the
garden
and
spoken
with
the
deliverer
the
epicureans
lived
simply
they
took
neither
flesh
nor
wine
and
there
is
a
letter
extant
asking
some
one
to
send
them
a
present
of
cheese
as
a
special
luxury
their
enemies
who
were
numerous
and
lively
make
the
obvious
accusations
about
the
hetairae
and
cite
an
alleged
letter
of
the
master
to
leontion
paean
my
dear
little
leontion
your
note
fills
me
with
such
a
bubble
of
excitement
the
problem
of
this
letter
well
illustrates
the
difficulty
of
forming
clear
judgements
about
the
details
of
ancient
life
probably
the
letter
is
a
forgery
we
are
definitely
informed
that
there
was
a
collection
of
such
forgeries
made
in
order
to
damage
epicurus
but
if
genuine
would
it
have
seemed
to
a
contemporary
a
permissible
or
an
impermissible
letter
for
a
philosopher
to
write
by
modern
standards
it
would
be
about
the
and
again
suppose
it
is
a
definite
what
means
have
we
of
deciding
whether
epicurus
or
for
that
matter
zeno
or
plato
or
any
unconventional
philosopher
of
this
period
would
have
thought
it
blameworthy
or
would
merely
have
called
our
attention
to
the
legal
difficulties
of
contracting
marriage
with
one
who
had
been
a
hetaira
and
asked
us
how
we
expect
men
and
women
to
live
curiously
enough
we
happen
to
have
the
recorded
sayings
of
epicurus
himself
wise
man
will
not
fall
in
love
and
union
of
the
sexes
never
did
good
it
is
much
if
it
does
not
do
harm
this
philosophy
is
often
unjustly
criticized
it
is
called
selfish
but
that
it
is
certainly
not
it
is
always
aiming
at
the
deliverance
of
mankind
and
it
bases
its
happiness
on
ÏÎ¹Î»á½·Î±
friendship
or
affection
just
as
the
early
christians
based
it
on
á¼Î³á½±ÏÎ·
a
word
no

stronger
than
ÏÎ¹Î»á½·Î±
though
it
is
conventionally
translated
by
this
conception
it
becomes
at

more
human
than
the
stoa
to
which
as
to
a
christian
monk
human
affection
was
merely
a
weakness
of
the
flesh
which
might
often
conflict
with
the
soul
duty
towards
god
epicurus
passionately
protested
against
this
unnatural
it
was
also
human
in
that
it
recognized
degrees
of
good
or
bad
of
virtue
or
error
to
the
stoic
that
which
was
not
right
was
wrong
a
calculator
who
says
that
seven
sevens
make
is
just
as
wrong
as
one
who
says
they
make
a
thousand
and
a
sailor
one
inch
below
the
surface
of
the
water
drowns
just
as
surely
as
one
who
is
a
furlong
deep
just
so
in
human
life
wrong
is
wrong
falsehood
is
falsehood
and
to
talk
of
degrees
is
childish
epicureanism
had
an
easy
and
natural
answer
to
these
arguments
since
pleasure
and
pain
obviously
admit
of
degrees
the
school
is
blamed
also
for
pursuing
pleasure
on
the
ground
that
the
direct
pursuit
of
pleasure
is
but
epicurus
never
makes
that
mistake
he
says
that
pleasure
or
of
life
is
the
good
but
he
never
counsels
the
direct
pursuit
of
it
quite
the
reverse
he
says
that
if
you
conquer
your
desires
and
fears
and
live
simply
and
love
those
about
you
the
natural
sweetness
of
life
will
reveal
itself
a
truer
criticism
is
one
which
appears
dimly
in
plutarch
and
cicero
there
is
a
strange
shadow
of
sadness
hanging
over
this
wise
and
kindly
faith
which
proceeds
from
the
essential
distrust
of
life
that
lies
at
its
heart
the
best
that
epicurus
has
really
to
say
of
the
world
is
that
if
you
are
very
wise
and
do
not
attract
its
notice
Î»á½±Î¸Îµ
Î²Î¹á½½ÏÎ±Ï
it
will
not
hurt
you
it
is
a
philosophy
not
of
conquest
but
of
escape
this
was
a
weakness
from
which
few
of
the
thinkers
completely
escaped
to
aim
at
what
we
should
call
positive
happiness
was
to
the
epicureans
only
to
court
disappointment
better
make
it
your
aim
to
live
without
strong
passion
or
desire
without
high
hopes
or
ambitions
their
professed
ideals

removal
of
all
active
suffering
smooth
flow
seem
to
result
in
rather
a
low
tension
in
a
life
that
is
only
half
alive
we
know
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
was
not
so
the
epicureans
felt
their
doctrine
to
bring
not
mere
comfort
but
inspiration
and
blessedness
the
young
colotes
on
first
hearing
the
master
speak
fell
on
his
knees
with
tears
and
hailed
him
as
a
god
we
may
compare
the
rapturous
phrases
of
lucretius
what
can
be
the
explanation
of
this
perhaps
it
is
that
a
deep
distrust
of
the
world
produces
its
own
inward
reaction
as
starving
men
dream
of
rich
banquets
and
persecuted
sects
have
apocalyptic
visions
of
paradise
the
hopes
and
desires
that
are
starved
of
their
natural
sustenance
project
themselves
on
to
some
plane
of
the
imagination
the
martyr
even
the
most
heretical
martyr
sees
the
vision
of
his
crown
in
the
skies
the
lover
sees
in
obvious
defects
only
rare
and
esoteric
beauties
epicurus
avoided
sedulously
the
transcendental
optimism
of
the
stoics
he
avoided
mysticism
avoided
allegory
avoided
faith
he
tried
to
set
the
feet
of
his
philosophy
on
solid
ground
he
can
make
a
strong
case
for
the
probable
happiness
of
a
man
of
kindly
affections
and
few
desires
who
asks
little
from
the
outside
world
but
after
all
it
is
only
probable
misfortunes
and
miseries
may
come
to
any
man
of
the
evils
you
fear
are
false
he
answers
still
reasonably
does
not
hurt
poverty
need
never
make
a
man
less
happy
and
actual
pain
pain
may
come
but
you
can
endure
it
intense
pains
are
brief
pains
are
not
excruciating
or
seldom
so
is
that
comfort
not
enough
the
doctrine
becomes
more
intense
both
in
its
promises
and
its
demands
if
intense
suffering
comes
he
enjoins
turn
away
your
mind
and
conquer
the
pain
by
the
of
memory
there
are
in
every
wise
life
moments
of
intense
beauty
and
delight
if
he
has
strength
of
mind
he
will
call
them
back
to
him
at
will
and
live
in
the
blessedness
of
the
past
not
in
the
mere
dull
agony
of
the
moment
nay
can
he
not
actually
enjoy
the
intellectual
interest
of
this
or
that
pang
has
he
not
that
within
him
which
can
make
the
quality
of
its
own
life
on
hearing
of
the
death
of
a
friend
he
will
call
back
the
sweetness
of
that
converse
in
the
burning
bull
of
phalaris
he
will
think
his
thoughts
and
be
glad
illusion
the
old
siren
with
whom
man
can
not
live
in
peace
nor
yet
without
her
has
crept
back
unseen
to
the
centre
of
the
citadel
it
was
epicurus
and
not
a
stoic
or
cynic
who
asserts
that
a
wise
man
will
be
happy
on
the
rack
strangely
obliging
ironic
fortune
gave
to
him
also
a
chance
of
testing
of
his
own
doctrine
there
is
extant
a
letter
written
on
his
write
to
you
on
this
blissful
day
which
is
the
last
of
my
life
the
obstruction
of
my
bladder
and
internal
pains
have
reached
the
extreme
point
but
there
is
marshalled
against
them
the
delight
of
my
mind
in
thinking
over
our
talks
together
take
care
of
the
children
of
metrodorus
in
a
way
worthy
of
your
devotion
to
me
and
to
philosophy
at
least
his
courage
and
his
kindness
did
not
fail
epicureanism
had
certainly
its
sublime
side
and
from
this
very
sublimity
perhaps
arose
the
greatest
flaw
in
the
system
regarded
as
a
rational
philosophy
it
was
accepted
too
much
as
a
revelation
too
little
as
a
mere
step
in
the
search
for
truth
it
was
based
no
doubt
on
careful
and
even
profound
scientific
studies
and
was
expounded
by
the
master
in
a
vast
array
of
volumes
but
the
result
so
attained
was
considered
sufficient
further
research
was
not
encouraged
heterodoxy
was
condemned
as
something
almost
approaching
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
was
deliberately
frowned
upon
when
other
philosophers
were
working
out
calculations
about
the
size
of
the
sun
and
the
commensurability
of
the
and
the
epicurus
contemptuously
remarked
that
the
sun
was
probably
about
as
big
as
it
looked
or
perhaps
smaller
since
fires
at
a
distance
generally
look
bigger
than
they
are
the
various
theories
of
learned
men
were
all
possible
but
none
certain
and
as
for
the
cycles
how
did
any
one
know
that
there
was
not
a
new
sun
shot
off
and
extinguished
every
day
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
that
none
of
the
great
discoveries
of
the
hellenistic
age
were
due
to
the
epicurean
school
lucretius
writing
years
later
appears
to
vary
hardly
in
any
detail
from
the
doctrines
of
the
master
and
diogenes
of
oenoanda
years
later
actually
repeats
his
letters
and
sayings
word
for
word
it
is
sad
this
it
is
it
is
a
clear
symptom
of
decadence
from
the
free
intellectual
movement
and
the
high
hopes
which
had
made
the
fifth
century
glorious
only
in
one
great
school
does
the
true
hellenic
continue
flourishing
a
school
whose
modesty
of
pretension
and
quietness
of
language
form
a
curious
contrast
with
the
rapt
ecstasies
of
stoic
and
cynic
and
even
as
we
have
seen
of
epicurean
just
as
its
immense
richness
of
scientific
achievement
contrasts
with
their
comparative
sterility
the
porch
and
the
garden
offered
new
religions
to
raise
from
the
dust
men
and
women
whose
spirits
were
broken
aristotle
in
his
open
walk
or
brought
philosophy
and
science
and
literature
to
guide
the
feet
and
interest
the
minds
of
those
who
still
saw
life
steadily
and
tried
their
best
to
see
it
whole
aristotle
was
not
lacking
in
religious
insight
and
imagination
as
he
certainly
was
not
without
profound
influence
on
the
future
history
of
religion
his
complete
rejection
of
mythology
and
of
anthropomorphism
his
resolute
attempt
to
combine
religion
and
science
not
by
sacrificing
one
to
the
other
but
by
building
the
highest
spiritual
aspirations
on
ascertained
truth
and
the
probable
conclusions
to
which
it
pointed
his
splendid
imaginative
conception
of
the
divine
being
or
first
cause
as
unmoved
itself
while
moving
all
the
universe
the
beloved
moves
the
lover
all
these
are
high
services
to
religious
speculation
and
justify
the
position
he
held
even
when
known
only
through
a
distorting
arabic
translation
in
medieval
christianity
if
he
had
not
written
his
other
books
he
might
well
be
famous
now
as
a
great
religious
teacher
but
his
theology
is
dwarfed
by
the
magnificence
and
mass
of
his
other
work
and
as
a
philosopher
and
man
of
science
he
does
not
belong
to
our
present
subject
he
is
only
mentioned
here
as
a
standard
of
that
characteristic
quality
in
hellenism
from
which
the
rest
of
this
book
records
a
downfall
one
variant
of
a
story
tells
how
a
certain
philosopher
after
frequenting
the
peripatetic
school
went
to
hear
chrysippus
the
stoic
and
was
transfixed
was
like
turning
from
men
to
gods
it
was
really
turning
from
greeks
to
semites
from
philosophy
to
religion
from
a
school
of
very
sober
professions
and
high
performance
to
one
whose
professions
dazzled
the
reason
unto
me
cried
the
stoic
ye
who
are
in
storm
or
delusion
i
will
show
you
the
truth
and
the
world
will
never
grieve
you
more
aristotle
made
no
such
profession
he
merely
thought
and
worked
and
taught
better
than
other
men
aristotle
is
always
surprising
us
not
merely
by
the
immense
volume
of
clear
thinking
and
knowledge
of
which
he
was
master
but
by
the
steady
of
his
temper
son
of
the
court
physician
of
philip
tutor
for
some
years
to
alexander
the
great
he
never
throughout
his
extant
writings
utters
one
syllable
of
flattery
to
his
royal
and
employers
nor
yet
one
syllable
which
suggests
a
grievance
he
saw
at
close
quarters
and
from
the
winning
side
the
conquest
of
the
greek
city
states
by
the
macedonian
or
nation
but
he
judges
dispassionately
that
the
city
is
the
higher
social
form
it
seems
characteristic
that
in
his
will
which
is
extant
after
providing
a
dowry
for
his
widow
herpyllis
to
facilitate
her
getting
a
second
husband
and
thanking
her
for
her
goodness
to
him
he
directs
that
his
bones
are
to
be
laid
in
the
same
grave
with
those
of
his
first
wife
pythias
whom
he
had
rescued
from
robbers
more
than
twenty
years
before
other
philosophers
disliked
him
because
he
wore
no
long
beard
dressed
neatly
and
had
good
normal
manners
and
they
despised
his
philosophy
for
very
similar
reasons
it
was
a
school
which
took
the
existing
world
and
tried
to
understand
it
instead
of
inventing
some
intense
ecstatic
doctrine
which
should
transform
it
or
reduce
it
to
nothingness
it
possessed
no
open
sesame
to
unlock
the
prison
of
mankind
yet
it
is
not
haunted
by
that
of
kynoskephalai
while
armies
sweep
greece
this
way
and
that
while
the
old
gods
are
vanquished
and
the
cities
lose
their
freedom
and
their
meaning
the
peripatetics
instead
of
passionately
saving
souls
diligently
pursued
knowledge
and
in
generation
after
generation
produced
scientific
results
which
put
all
their
rivals
into
the
shade
in
mathematics
astronomy
physics
botany
zoology
and
biology
as
well
as
the
human
sciences
of
literature
and
history
the
hellenistic
age
was
one
of
the
most
creative
known
to
our
record
and
it
is
not
only
that
among
the
savants
responsible
for
these
advances
the
proportion
of
peripatetics
is
overwhelming
one
may
also
notice
that
in
this
school
alone
it
is
assumed
as
natural
that
further
research
will
take
place
and
will
probably
correct
as
well
as
increase
our
knowledge
and
that
when
such
corrections
or
differences
of
opinion
do
take
place
there
is
no
cry
raised
of
heresy
it
is
the
old
difference
between
philosophy
and
religion
between
the
search
of
the
intellect
for
truth
and
the
cry
of
the
heart
for
salvation
as
the
interest
in
truth
for
its
own
sake
gradually
abated
in
the
ancient
world
the
works
of
aristotle
might
still
find
commentators
but
his
example
was
forgotten
and
his
influence
confined
to
a
small
circle
the
porch
and
the
garden
for
the
most
part
divided
between
them
the
allegiance
of
thoughtful
men
both
systems
had
begun
in
days
of
discomfiture
and
aimed
originally
more
at
providing
a
refuge
for
the
soul
than
at
ordering
the
course
of
society
but
after
the
turmoil
of
the
fourth
century
had
subsided
when
governments
began
again
to
approach
more
nearly
to
peace
and
consequently
to
justice
and
public
life
once
more
to
be
attractive
to
decent
men
both
philosophies
showed
themselves
adaptable
to
the
needs
of
prosperity
as
well
as
adversity
many
kings
and
great
roman
governors
professed
stoicism
it
held
before
them
the
ideal
of
universal
brotherhood
and
of
duty
to
the
society
of
gods
and
men
it
enabled
them
to
work
indifferent
to
mere
pain
and
pleasure
as
servants
of
the
divine
purpose
and
with
god
in
building
up
a
human
cosmos
within
the
eternal
cosmos
it
is
perhaps
at
first
sight
strange
that
many
kings
and
governors
also
followed
epicurus
yet
after
all
the
work
of
a
public
man
is
not
hindered
by
a
slight
irony
as
to
the
value
of
worldly
greatness
and
a
conviction
that
a
dinner
of
bread
and
water
with
love
to
season
it
better
than
all
the
crowns
of
the
greeks
to
hate
cruelty
and
superstition
to
avoid
passion
and
luxury
to
regard
human
or
of
life
as
the
goal
to
be
aimed
at
and
or
as
the
principal
element
in
that
pleasure
are
by
no
means
doctrines
incompatible
with
wise
and
effective
administration
both
systems
were
good
and
both
in
a
way
complementary
one
to
another
they
still
divide
between
them
the
practical
philosophy
of
western
mankind
at
times
to
most
of
us
it
seems
as
though
nothing
in
life
had
value
except
to
do
right
and
to
fear
not
at
others
that
the
only
true
aim
is
to
make
mankind
happy
at
times
man
best
hope
seems
to
lie
in
that
part
of
him
which
is
prepared
to
defy
or
condemn
the
world
of
fact
if
it
diverges
from
the
ideal
in
that
intensity
of
reverence
which
will
accept
many
impossibilities
rather
than
ever
reject
a
holy
thing
above
all
in
that
uncompromising
moral
sensitiveness
to
which
not
merely
the
corruptions
of
society
but
the
fundamental
and
necessary
facts
of
animal
existence
seem
both
nauseous
and
wicked
links
and
chains
in
a
system
which
can
never
be
the
true
home
of
the
human
spirit
at
other
times
men
feel
the
need
to
adapt
their
beliefs
and
actions
to
the
world
as
it
is
to
brush
themselves
free
from
cobwebs
to
face
plain
facts
with
common
sense
and
as
much
kindliness
as
life
permits
meeting
the
ordinary
needs
of
a
perishable
and
imperfect
species
without
illusion
and
without
at
one
time
we
are
stoics
at
another
epicureans
but
amid
their
differences
there
is
one
faith
which
was
held
by
both
schools
in
common
it
is
the
great
characteristic
faith
of
the
ancient
world
revealing
itself
in
many
divergent
guises
and
seldom
fully
intelligible
to
modern
men
faith
in
the
absolute
supremacy
of
the
inward
life
over
things
external
these
men
really
believed
that
wisdom
is
more
precious
than
jewels
that
poverty
and
ill
health
are
things
of
no
import
that
the
good
man
is
happy
whatever
befall
him
and
all
the
rest
and
in
generation
after
generation
many
of
the
ablest
men
and
women
also
acted
upon
the
belief
they
lived
by
free
choice
lives
whose
simplicity
and
privation
would
horrify
a
modern
labourer
and
the
world
about
them
seems
to
have
respected
rather
than
despised
their
poverty
to
the
middle
age
with
its
monks
and
mendicants
expectant
of
reward
in
heaven
such
an
attitude
except
for
its
disinterestedness
would
be
easily
understood
to
some
eastern
nations
with
their
cults
of
asceticism
and
contemplation
the
same
doctrines
have
appealed
almost
like
a
physical
passion
or
a
dangerous
drug
running
riot
in
their
veins
but
modern
western
man
can
not
believe
them
nor
believe
seriously
that
others
believe
them
on
us
the
power
of
the
material
world
has
through
our
very
mastery
of
it
and
the
dependence
which
results
from
that
mastery
both
inwardly
and
outwardly
increased
its
hold
ferum
victorem
we
have
taken
possession
of
it
and
now
we
can
not
move
without
it
the
material
element
in
modern
life
is
far
greater
than
in
ancient
but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
spiritual
element
is
correspondingly
less
no
doubt
it
is
true
that
a
naval
officer
in
a
in
a
modern
battle
does
not
need
less
courage
and
character
than
a
naked
savage
who
meets
his
enemy
with
a
stick
and
a
spear
yet
probably
in
the
first
case
the
battle
is
mainly
decided
by
the
weight
and
accuracy
of
the
guns
in
the
second
by
the
qualities
of
the
fighter
consequently
the
modern
world
thinks
more
incessantly
and
anxiously
about
the
guns
that
is
about
money
and
mechanism
the
ancient
devotes
its
thought
more
to
human
character
and
duty
and
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
in
general
each
tries
to
remedy
what
is
wrong
with
the
world
by
the
method
that
is
habitually
in
its
thoughts
speaking
broadly
apart
from
certain
religious
movements
the
enlightened
modern
reformer
if
confronted
with
some
ordinary
complex
of
misery
and
wickedness
instinctively
proposes
to
cure
it
by
higher
wages
better
food
more
comfort
and
leisure
to
make
people
comfortable
and
trust
to
their
becoming
good
the
typical
ancient
reformer
would
appeal
to
us
to
care
for
none
of
those
things
since
riches
notoriously
do
not
make
men
virtuous
but
with
all
our
powers
to
pursue
wisdom
or
righteousness
and
the
life
of
the
spirit
to
be
good
men
as
we
can
be
if
we
will
and
to
know
that
all
else
will
follow
this
is
one
of
the
regions
in
which
the
ancients
might
have
learned
much
from
us
and
in
which
we
still
have
much
to
learn
from
them
if
once
we
can
shake
off
our
temporal
obsessions
and
listen

as
an
example
it
is
worth
noticing

we
hear
more
about
his
work
on
the
history
of
literature
though
his
generation
was
almost
the
first
to
realize
that
such
a
subject
had
any
existence
he
wrote
of
a
subject
hitherto
not
considered
worth
recording
giving
the
biographical
facts
followed
by
philosophic
and
aesthetic
criticism
we
hear
for
example
of
his
life
of
plato
of
pythagoras
in
which
he
laid
emphasis
on
the
practical
work
of
xenophanes
and
of
the
seven
wise
men
he
also
wrote
of
we
hear
of
books
on
alcaeus

on

in
which
latter
he
is
said
to
have
made
the
startling
remark
that
the

be
pronounced
in
the
aeolic
dialect
whatever
this
remark
exactly
meant
and
we
can
not
tell
without
the
context
it
seems
an
extraordinary
anticipation

modern
philological

also
seems

have
devised
the
method

the

means
of

the
method
soon
after
developed
by
eratosthenes
into
latitude

attempted
calculations

the
measurements

large

distances
for
which
of

both
his

his

were
inadequate
nevertheless
his
measurements
remained
a
standard

find
them
quoted

criticized
by
strabo

polybius
and
lastly
he
published

of
of
hope
in
this
life
and
of
faith
in
normal
human
effort
a
despair
of
patient
inquiry
a
cry
for
infallible
revelation
an
indifference
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
a
conversion
of
the
soul
to
god
it
is
an
atmosphere
in
which
the
aim
of
the
good
man
is
not
so
much
to
live
justly
to
help
the
society
to
which
he
belongs
and
enjoy
the
esteem
of
his
fellow
creatures
but
rather
by
means
of
a
burning
faith
by
contempt
for
the
world
and
its
standards
by
ecstasy
suffering
and
martyrdom
to
be
granted
pardon
for
his
unspeakable
unworthiness
his
immeasurable
sins
there
is
an
intensifying
of
certain
spiritual
emotions
an
increase
of
sensitiveness
a
failure
of
nerve
now
this
antithesis
is
often
exaggerated
by
the
admirers
of
one
side
or
the
other
a
hundred
people
write
as
if
sophocles
had
no
mysticism
and
practically
speaking
no
conscience
half
a
dozen
retort
as
if
paul
had
no
public
spirit
and
no
common
sense
i
have
protested
often
against
this
exaggeration
but
stated
reasonably
as
a
change
of
proportion
and
not
a
creation
of
new
hearts
the
antithesis
is
certainly
based
on
fact
the
historical
reasons
for
it
are
suggested
above
in
the
first
of
these
essays
my
description
of
this
complicated
change
is
of
course
inadequate
but
not
i
hope
i
do
not
depreciate
the
religions
that
followed
on
this
movement
by
describing
the
movement
itself
as
a
of
nerve
mankind
has
not
yet
decided
which
of
two
opposite
methods
leads
to
the
fuller
and
deeper
knowledge
of
the
world
the
patient
and
sympathetic
study
of
the
good
citizen
who
lives
in
it
or
the
ecstatic
vision
of
the
saint
who
rejects
it
but
probably
most
christians
are
inclined
to
believe
that
without
some
failure
and
sense
of
failure
without
a
contrite
heart
and
conviction
of
sin
man
can
hardly
attain
the
religious
life
i
can
imagine
an
historian
of
this
temper
believing
that
the
period
we
are
about
to
discuss
was
a
necessary
softening
of
human
pride
a
i
am
concerned
in
this
paper
with
the
lower
country
lying
between
two
great
ranges
the
one
range
is
greek
philosophy
culminating
in
plato
aristotle
the
porch
and
the
garden
the
other
is
christianity
culminating
in
paul
and
his
successors
the
one
is
the
work
of
hellas
using
some
few
foreign
elements
the
second
is
the
work
of
hellenistic
culture
on
a
hebrew
stock
the
books
of
christianity
are
greek
the
philosophical
background
is
hellenistic
the
result
of
the
interplay
in
the
free
atmosphere
of
greek
philosophy
of
religious
ideas
derived
from
egypt
anatolia
syria
and
babylon
the
preaching
is
carried
on
in
greek
among
the
workmen
of
the
great
manufacturing
and
commercial
cities
the
first
preachers
are
jews
the
central
scene
is
set
in
jerusalem
i
wish
in
this
essay
to
indicate
how
a
period
of
religious
history
which
seems
broken
is
really
continuous
and
to
trace
the
lie
of
the
main
valleys
which
lead
from
the
one
range
to
the
other
through
a
large
and
imperfectly
explored
territory
the
territory
in
question
is
the
hellenistic
age
the
period
during
which
the
schools
of
greece
were
the
world
it
is
a
time
of
great
enlightenment
of
vigorous
propaganda
of
high
importance
to
history
it
is
a
time
full
of
great
names
in
one
school
of
philosophy
alone
we
have
zeno
cleanthes
chrysippus
panaetius
posidonius
yet
curiously
enough
it
is
represented
in
our
tradition
by
something
very
like
a
mere
void
there
are
practically
no
complete
books
preserved
only
fragments
and
indirect
quotations
consequently
in
the
search
for
information
about
this
age
we
must
throw
our
nets
wide
beside
books
and
inscriptions
of
the
hellenistic
period
proper
i
have
drawn
on
cicero
pliny
seneca
and
the
like
for
evidence
about
their
teachers
and
masters
i
have
used
many
christian
and
gnostic
documents
and
works
like
the
corpus
of
hermetic
writings
and
the
mithras
liturgy
among
modern
writers
i
must
acknowledge
a
special
debt
to
the
researches
of
dieterich
cumont
bousset
wendland
and
reitzenstein
the
hellenistic
age
seems
at
first
sight
to
have
entered
on
an
inheritance
such
as
our
speculative
anarchists
sometimes
long
for
a
on
which
a
new
and
highly
gifted
generation
of
thinkers
might
write
clean
and
certain
the
book
of
their
discoveries
about
life
what
herodotus
would
call
their
for
as
we
have
seen
in
the
last
essay
it
is
clear
that
by
the
time
of
plato
the
traditional
religion
of
the
greek
states
was
if
taken
at
its
face
value
a
bankrupt
concern
there
was
hardly
one
aspect
in
which
it
could
bear
criticism
and
in
the
kind
of
test
that
chiefly
matters
the
satisfaction
of
ethical
requirements
and
aspirations
it
was
if
anything
weaker
than
elsewhere
now
a
religious
belief
that
is
scientifically
preposterous
may
still
have
a
long
and
comfortable
life
before
it
any
worshipper
can
suspend
the
scientific
part
of
his
mind
while
worshipping
but
a
religious
belief
that
is
morally
contemptible
is
in
serious
danger
because
when
the
religious
emotions
surge
up
the
moral
emotions
are
not
far
away
and
the
clash
can
not
be
hidden
this
collapse
of
the
traditional
religion
of
greece
might
not
have
mattered
so
much
if
the
form
of
greek
social
life
had
remained
if
a
good
greek
had
his
polis
he
had
an
adequate
substitute
in
most
respects
for
any
mythological
gods
but
the
polis
too
as
we
have
seen
in
the
last
essay
fell
with
the
rise
of
macedon
it
fell
perhaps
not
from
any
special
spiritual
fault
of
its
own
it
had
few
faults
except
its
fatal
narrowness
but
simply
because
there
now
existed
another
social
whole
which
whether
higher
or
lower
in
civilization
was
at
any
rate
utterly
superior
in
brute
force
and
in
money
devotion
to
the
polis
lost
its
reality
when
the
polis
with
all
that
it
represented
of
rights
and
laws
and
ideals
of
life
lay
at
the
mercy
of
a
military
despot
who
might
of
course
be
a
hero
but
might
equally
well
be
a
vulgar
sot
or
a
corrupt
adventurer
what
the
succeeding
ages
built
upon
the
ruins
of
the
polis
is
not
our
immediate
concern
in
the
realm
of
thought
on
the
whole
the
polis
triumphed
aristotle
based
his
social
theory
on
the
polis
not
the
nation
dicaearchus
didymus
and
posidonius
followed
him
and
we
still
use
his
language
rome
herself
was
a
polis
as
well
as
an
empire
and
professor
haverfield
has
pointed
out
that
a
city
has
more
chance
of
taking
in
the
whole
world
to
its
freedoms
and
privileges
than
a
nation
has
of
making
men
of
alien
birth
its
compatriots
a
jew
of
tarsus
could
easily
be
granted
the
civic
rights
of
rome
he
could
never
have
been
made
an
italian
or
a
frenchman
the
stoic
ideal
of
the
world
as
great
city
of
gods
and
men
has
not
been
surpassed
by
any
ideal
based
on
the
nation
what
we
have
to
consider
is
the
general
trend
of
religious
thought
from
say
the
peripatetics
to
the
gnostics
it
is
a
fairly
clear
history
a
soil
once
teeming
with
wild
weeds
was
to
all
appearance
swept
bare
and
made
ready
for
new
sowing
skilled
gardeners
chose
carefully
the
best
of
herbs
and
plants
and
tended
the
garden
sedulously
but
the
bounds
of
the
garden
kept
spreading
all
the
while
into
strange
untended
ground
and
even
within
the
original
walls
the
weeding
had
been
hasty
and
incomplete
at
the
end
of
a
few
generations
all
was
a
wilderness
of
weeds
again
weeds
rank
and
luxuriant
and
sometimes
extremely
beautiful
with
a
garden
flower
or
two
gleaming
here
and
there
in
the
tangle
of
them
does
that
comparison
seem
disrespectful
to
religion
is
philosophy
all
flowers
and
traditional
belief
all
weeds
well
think
what
a
weed
is
it
is
only
a
name
for
all
the
natural
wild
vegetation
which
the
earth
sends
up
of
herself
which
lives
and
will
live
without
the
conscious
labour
of
man
the
flowers
are
what
we
keep
alive
with
difficulty
the
weeds
are
what
conquer
us
it
has
been
well
observed
by
zeller
that
the
great
weakness
of
all
ancient
thought
not
excepting
socratic
thought
was
that
instead
of
appealing
to
objective
experiment
it
appealed
to
some
subjective
sense
of
fitness
there
were
exceptions
of
course
democritus
eratosthenes
hippocrates
and
to
a
great
extent
aristotle
but
in
general
there
was
a
strong
tendency
to
follow
plato
in
supposing
that
people
could
really
solve
questions
by
an
appeal
to
their
inner
consciousness
one
result
of
this
no
doubt
was
a
tendency
to
lay
too
much
stress
on
mere
agreement
it
is
obvious
when
one
thinks
about
it
that
quite
often
a
large
number
of
people
who
know
nothing
about
a
subject
will
all
agree
and
all
be
wrong
yet
we
find
the
most
radical
of
ancient
philosophers
unconsciously
dominated
by
the
argument
consensu
it
is
hard
to
find
two
more
uncompromising
thinkers
than
zeno
and
epicurus
yet
both
of
them
when
they
are
almost
free
from
the
popular
superstitions
when
they
have
constructed
complete
systems
which
if
not
absolutely
are
calculated
at
least
to
keep
out
the
weather
for
a
century
or
so
open
curious
at
the
last
moment
and
let
in
all
the
gods
of
mythology
true
they
are
admitted
as
suspicious
characters
and
under
promise
of
good
behaviour
epicurus
explains
that
they
do
not
and
can
not
do
anything
whatever
to
anybody
zeno
explains
that
they
are
not
anthropomorphic
and
are
only
symbols
or
emanations
or
subordinates
of
the
unity
both
parties
get
rid
of
the
myths
but
the
two
great
reformers
have
admitted
a
dangerous
principle
the
general
consensus
of
humanity
they
say
shows
that
there
are
gods
and
gods
which
in
mind
if
not
also
in
visual
appearance
resemble
man
epicurus
succeeded
in
barring
the
door
and
admitted
nothing
more
but
the
stoics
presently
found
themselves
admitting
or
insisting
that
the
same
consensus
proved
the
existence
of
daemons
of
witchcraft
of
divination
and
when
they
combined
with
the
platonic
school
of
more
dangerous
elements
still
i
take
the
stoics
and
epicureans
as
the
two
most
radical
schools
on
the
whole
both
of
them
fought
steadily
and
strongly
against
the
growth
of
superstition
or
if
you
like
to
put
it
in
other
language
against
the
dumb
demands
of
man
nature
the
glory
of
the
stoics
is
to
have
built
up
a
religion
of
extraordinary
nobleness
the
glory
of
the
epicureans
is
to
have
upheld
an
ideal
of
sanity
and
humanity
stark
upright
amid
a
reeling
world
and
like
the
old
spartans
never
to
have
yielded
one
inch
of
ground
to
the
common
foe
the
great
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
mind
of
man
can
not
be
enlightened
permanently
by
merely
teaching
him
to
reject
some
particular
set
of
superstitions
there
is
an
infinite
supply
of
other
superstitions
always
at
hand
and
the
mind
that
desires
such
things
that
is
the
mind
that
has
not
trained
itself
to
the
hard
discipline
of
reasonableness
and
honesty
will
as
soon
as
its
devils
are
cast
out
proceed
to
fill
itself
with
their
relations
let
us
first
consider
the
result
of
the
mere
denial
of
the
olympian
religion
the
essential
postulate
of
that
religion
was
that
the
world
is
governed
by
a
number
of
definite
personal
gods
possessed
of
a
human
sense
of
justice
and
fairness
and
capable
of
being
influenced
by
normal
human
motives
in
general
they
helped
the
good
and
punished
the
bad
though
doubtless
they
tended
too
much
to
regard
as
good
those
who
paid
them
proper
attention
and
as
bad
those
who
did
not
speaking
broadly
what
was
left
when
this
conception
proved
inadequate
if
it
was
not
these
personal
gods
who
made
things
happen
what
was
it
if
the
tower
of
siloam
was
not
deliberately
thrown
down
by
the
gods
so
as
to
kill
and
hurt
a
carefully
collected
number
of
wicked
people
while
letting
the
good
escape
what
was
the
explanation
of
its
falling
the
answer
is
obvious
but
it
can
be
put
in
two
ways
you
can
either
say
was
just
chance
that
the
tower
fell
at
that
particular
moment
when
was
under
it
or
you
can
say
with
rather
more
reflection
but
not
any
more
common
sense
fell
because
of
a
definite
chain
of
causes
a
certain
degree
of
progressive
decay
in
the
building
a
certain
definite
pressure
it
was
bound
to
fall
there
is
no
real
difference
in
these
statements
at
least
in
the
meaning
of
those
who
ordinarily
utter
them
both
are
compatible
with
a
reasonable
and
scientific
view
of
the
world
but
in
the
hellenistic
age
when
greek
thought
was
spreading
rapidly
and
superficially
over
vast
populations
whose
minds
were
not
ripe
for
it
both
views
turned
back
instinctively
into
a
theology
as
personal
as
that
of
the
olympians
it
was
not
of
course
zeus
or
apollo
who
willed
this
every
one
knew
so
much
it
happened
by
chance
that
is
chance
or
fortune
willed
it
and
Ïá½»ÏÎ·
became
a
goddess
like
the
rest
the
great
catastrophes
the
great
transformations
of
the
mediterranean
world
which
marked
the
hellenistic
period
had
a
strong
influence
here
if
alexander
and
his
generals
had
practised
some
severely
orthodox
macedonian
religion
it
would
have
been
easy
to
see
that
the
gods
of
macedon
were
the
real
rulers
of
the
world
but
they
most
markedly
did
not
they
accepted
hospitably
all
the
religions
that
crossed
their
path
some
power
or
other
was
disturbing
the
world
that
was
clear
it
was
not
exactly
the
work
of
man
because
sometimes
the
good
were
exalted
sometimes
the
bad
there
was
no
consistent
purpose
in
the
story
it
was
just
fortune
happy
is
the
man
who
knows
how
to
placate
fortune
and
make
her
smile
upon
him
it
is
worth
remembering
that
the
best
for
superstition
is
a
society
in
which
the
fortunes
of
men
seem
to
bear
practically
no
relation
to
their
merits
and
efforts
a
stable
and
society
does
tend
speaking
roughly
to
ensure
that
the
virtuous
and
industrious
apprentice
shall
succeed
in
life
while
the
wicked
and
idle
apprentice
fails
and
in
such
a
society
people
tend
to
lay
stress
on
the
reasonable
or
visible
chains
of
causation
but
in
a
country
suffering
from
earthquakes
or
pestilences
in
a
court
governed
by
the
whim
of
a
despot
in
a
district
which
is
habitually
the
seat
of
a
war
between
alien
armies
the
ordinary
virtues
of
diligence
honesty
and
kindliness
seem
to
be
of
little
avail
the
only
way
to
escape
destruction
is
to
win
the
favour
of
the
prevailing
powers
take
the
side
of
the
strongest
invader
flatter
the
despot
placate
the
fate
or
fortune
or
angry
god
that
is
sending
the
earthquake
or
the
pestilence
the
hellenistic
period
pretty
certainly
falls
in
some
degree
under
all
of
these
categories
and
one
result
is
the
sudden
and
enormous
spread
of
the
worship
of
fortune
of
course
there
was
always
a
protest
there
is
the
famous
numen
habes
si
sit
prudentia
nos
te
nos
facimus
fortuna
taken
by
juvenal
from
the
greek
there
are
many
unguarded
phrases
and
at
least
three
corrections
in
polybius
most
interesting
of
all
perhaps
there
is
the
first
oration
of
plutarch
on
the
fortune
of
alexander
a
sentence
in
pliny
ii
seems
to
go
back
to
hellenistic
sources
the
whole
world
at
every
place
and
hour
by
every
voice
fortune
alone
is
invoked
and
her
name
spoken
she
is
the
one
defendant
the
one
culprit
the
one
thought
in
men
minds
the
one
object
of
praise
the
one
cause
she
is
worshipped
with
insults
counted
as
fickle
and
often
as
blind
wandering
inconsistent
elusive
changeful
and
friend
of
the
unworthy
we
are
so
much
at
the
mercy
of
chance
that
chance
is
our
god
the
word
used
is
first
and
then
this
shows
how
little
real
difference
there
is
between
the
two
apparently
contradictory
would
have
it
so
was
fated
to
be
the
sting
of
both
phrases
their
pleasant
bitterness
when
played
with
their
quality
of
poison
when
believed
lies
in

denial
of
the
value
of
human
endeavour
yet
on
the
whole
as
one
might
expect
the
believers
in
destiny
are
a
more
respectable
congregation
than
the
worshippers
of
chance
it
requires
a
certain
amount
of
thoughtfulness
to
rise
to
the
conception
that
nothing
really
happens
without
a
cause
it
is
the
beginning
perhaps
of
science
ionic
philosophers
of
the
fifth
century
had
laid
stress
on
the

we
should
call
the
chain

related

through
the

we
must
remember
was
to
the

in

the

or
the

rather
difficult
to
distinguish
from
the
pronoia
or

which
is
the
work
of
god
and
indeed
the
very
essence
of
god
thus
it
is
not
really
an
external
and
alien

for
the
human
soul
itself
is
a
fragment
or

of
the
divine

this

also
the
law

are
you
dragged
perforce
behind
the
the
doctrine
is
implied
in
cleanthes
celebrated
hymn
to
destiny
and
is
explained
clearly
by
plotinus
that
is
a
noble
conception
but
the
vulgar
of
course
can
turn
kismet
into
a
stupid
idol
as
easily
as
they
can
fortune
and
epicurus
may
have
had
some
excuse
for
exclaiming
that
he
would
sooner
be
a
slave
to
the
old
gods
of
the
vulgar
than
to
the
destiny
of
the
philosophers
so
much
for
the
result
in
superstitious
minds
of
the
denial
or
rather
the
removal
of
the
olympian
gods
it
landed
men
in
the
worship
of
fortune
or
of
fate
next
let
us
consider
what
happened
when
instead
of
merely
rejecting
the
gods
people
tried
carefully
to
collect
what
remained
of
religion
after
the
olympian
system
fell
aristotle
himself
gives
us
a
fairly
clear
answer
he
held
that
the
origins
of
man
idea
á¼Î½Î½Î¿Î¹Î±
of
the
divine
were
twofold
the
phenomena
of
the
sky
and
the
phenomena
of
the
human
soul
it
is
very
much
what
kant
found
two
thousand
years
later
the
spectacle
of
the
vast
and
ordered
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
are
compared
by
him
in
a
famous
fragment
with
the
marching
forth
of
homer
armies
before
troy
behind
such
various
order
and
strength
there
must
surely
be
a
conscious
mind
capable

á¼ÏÏÎ¹Î´Î¹á½½ÏÎ±Ï
to
order
steeds
of
war
and
mailÃ¨d
men
it
is
only
a
step
from
this
to
regarding
the
sun
moon
and
stars
as
themselves
divine
and
it
is
a
step
which
both
plato
and
aristotle
following
pythagoras
and
followed
by
the
stoics
take
with
confidence
chrysippus
gives
practically
the
same
list
of
gods
sun
moon
and
stars
and
law
and
men
who
have
become
gods
both
the
wandering
stars
and
the
fixed
stars
are
beings
divine
and
eternal
subordinate
gods
as
to
the
divinity
of
the
soul
or
the
mind
of
man
the
earlier
generations
are
shy
about
it
but
in
the
later
stoics
it
is
itself
a
portion
of
the
divine
life
it
shows
this
ordinarily
by
its
power
of
reason
and
more
conspicuously
by
becoming
á¼Î½Î¸ÎµÎ¿Ï
or
with
god
in
its
exalted
moments
of
prevision
ecstasy
and
prophetic
dreams
if
reason
itself
is
divine
there
is
something
else
in
the
soul
which
is
even
higher
than
reason
or
at
least
more
surprisingly
divine
let
us
follow
the
history
of
both
these
remaining
substitutes
for
the
olympian
gods
first
for
the
heavenly
bodies
if
they
are
to
be
made
divine
we
can
hardly
stop
there
the
earth
is
also
a
divine
being
old
tradition
has
always
said
so
and
plato
has
repeated
it
and
if
earth
is
divine
so
surely
are
the
other
elements
the
water
air
and
above
all
fire
for
the
gods
themselves
are
said
by
plato
to
be
made
of
fire
and
the
stars
visibly
are
so
though
perhaps
the
heavenly
fire
is
really
not
our
fire
at
all
but
a
Ïá½³Î¼ÏÏÎ¿Î½
Ïá¿¶Î¼Î±
a
body
seeing
that
it
seems
not
to
burn
nor
the
stars
to
be
consumed
this
is
persuasive
enough
and
philosophic
but
whither
has
it
led
us
back
to
the
olympians
or
rather
behind
the
olympians
as
paul
puts
it
gal
iv
to
beggarly
elements
the
old
korÃª
or
earth
maiden
and
mother
seems
to
have
held
her
own
unshaken
by
the
changes
of
time
all
over
the
aegean
area
she
is
there
in
prehistoric
crete
with
her
two
lions
with
the
same
lions
orientalized
in
olympia
and
ephesus
in
sparta
with
her
great
marsh
birds
in
boeotia
with
her
horse
she
runs
riot
in
a
number
of
the
gnostic
systems
both
and
she
forms
a
divine
triad
with
the
father
and
the
son
that
is
ancient
and
natural
but
she
also
becomes
the
divine
wisdom
sophia
the
divine
truth
aletheia
the
holy
breath
or
spirit
the
pneuma
since
the
word
for
is
neuter
in
greek
and
masculine
in
latin
this
last
is
rather
a
surprise
it
is
explained
when
we
remember
that
in
hebrew
the
word
for
spirit
is
mostly
feminine
in
the
meantime
let
us
notice
one
curious
development
in
the
life
of
this
goddess
in
the
old
religion
of
greece
and
western
asia
she
begins
as
a
maiden
then
in
fullness
of
time
becomes
a
mother
there
is
evidence
also
for
a
third
stage
the
widowhood
of
withering
autumn
to
the
classical
greek
this
motherhood
was
quite
as
it
should
be
a
due
fulfilment
of
normal
functions
but
to
the
gnostic
and
his
kind
it
connoted
a
a
passage
from
the
glory
of
virginity
to
a
state
of
sin
the
korÃª
becomes
a
fallen
virgin
sometimes
a
temptress
or
even
a
female
devil
sometimes
she
has
to
be
saved
by
her
son
the
redeemer
as
far
as
i
have
observed
she
loses
most
of
her
earthly
agricultural
quality
though
as
selene
or
even
helen
she
keeps
up
her
affinity
with
the
moon
almost
all
the
writers
of
the
hellenistic
age
agree
in
regarding
the
sun
moon
and
stars
as
gods
the
rationalists
hecataeus
and
euhemerus
before
going
on
to
their
deified
men
always
start
with
the
heavenly
bodies
when
plutarch
explains
in
his
beautiful
and
kindly
way
that
all
religions
are
really
attempts
towards
the
same
goal
he
clinches
his
argument
by
observing
that
we
all
see
the
same
sun
and
moon
though
we
call
them
by
different
names
in
all
languages
but
the
belief
does
not
seem
to
have
had
much
religious
intensity
in
it
until
it
was
reinforced
by
two
alien
influences
first
we
have
the
ancient
worship
of
the
sun
implicit
if
not
explicit
in
a
great
part
of
the
oldest
greek
rituals
and
then
idealized
by
plato
in
the
where
the
sun
is
the
author
of
all
light
and
life
in
the
material
world
as
the
idea
of
good
is
in
the
ideal
world
this
worship
came
gradually
into
contact
with
the
traditional
and
definite
of
persia
the
final
combination
took
place
curiously
late
it
was
the
roman
conquests
of
cilicia
cappadocia
commagene
and
armenia
that
gave
the
decisive
moment
to
men
who
had
wearied
of
the
myths
of
the
poets
who
could
draw
no
more
inspiration
from
their
apollo
and
hyperion
but
still
had
the
habits
and
the
craving
left
by
their
old
gods
a
fresh
breath
of
reality
came
with
the
entrance
of
á¼¥Î»Î¹Î¿Ï
á¼Î½á½·ÎºÎ·ÏÎ¿Ï
Î¼á½·Î¸ÏÎ±Ï
the
unconquered
sun
but
long
before
the
triumph
of
mithraism
as
the
military
religion
of
the
roman
frontier
greek
literature
is
permeated
with
a
kind
of
intense
language
about
the
sun
which
seems
derived
from
plato
in
later
times
in
the
fourth
century
for
instance
it
has
absorbed
some
more
and
less
critical
element
as
well
secondly
all
the
seven
planets
these
had
a
curious
history
the
planets
were
of
course
divine
and
living
bodies
so
much
plato
gave
us
then
come
arguments
and
questions
scattered
through
the
stoic
and
eclectic
literature
is
it
the
planet
itself
that
is
divine
or
is
the
planet
under
the
guidance
of
a
divine
spirit
the
latter
seems
to
win
the
day
anthropomorphism
has
stolen
back
upon
us
we
can
use
the
old
language
and
speak
simply
of
the
planet
mercury
as
á¼ÏÎ¼Î¿á¿¦
á¼ÏÏá½µÏ
it
is
the
star
of
hermes
and
hermes
is
the
spirit
who
guides
it
even
plato
in
his
old
age
had
much
to
say
about
the
souls
of
the
seven
planets
further
each
planet
has
its
sphere
the
earth
is
in
the
centre
then
comes
the
sphere
of
the
moon
then
that
of
the
sun
and
so
on
through
a
range
of
seven
spheres
if
all
things
are
full
of
gods
as
the
wise
ancients
have
said
what
about
those
parts
of
the
sphere
in
which
the
shining
planet
for
the
moment
is
not
are
they
without
god
obviously
not
the
whole
sphere
is
filled
with
innumerable
spirits
everywhere
it
is
all
hermes
all
aphrodite
we
are
more
familiar
with
the
latin
names
mercury
and
venus
but
one
part
only
is
visible
the
voice
of
one
school
as
usual
is
raised
in
opposition
one
veteran
had
seen
clearly
from
the
beginning
whither
all
this
sort
of
thing
was
sure
to
lead
approves
none
of
these
things
it
was
no
good
his
having
destroyed
the
old
traditional
superstition
if
people
by
deifying
the
stars
were
to
fill
the
sky
with
seven
times
seven
as
many
objects
of
worship
as
had
been
there
before
he
allows
no
about
the
stars
they
are
divine
animate
beings
or
guided
by
gods
why
can
not
the
astrologers
leave
god
in
peace
when
their
orbits
are
irregular
it
is
because
they
are
looking
for
food
they
are
just
conglomerations
of
ordinary
atoms
of
air
or
fire
it
does
not
matter
which
they
are
not
even
very
large
only
about
as
large
as
they
look
or
perhaps
smaller
since
most
fires
tend
to
look
bigger
at
a
distance
they
are
not
at
all
certainly
everlasting
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
sun
comes
to
an
end
every
day
and
a
new
one
rises
in
the
morning
all
kinds
of
explanations
are
possible
and
none
certain

in
any
case
as
you
value
your
life
and
your
reason
do
not
begin
making
myths
about
them
on
other
lines
came
what
might
have
been
the
effective
protest
of
real
science
when
aristarchus
of
samos
argued
that
the
earth
was
not
really
the
centre
of
the
universe
but
revolved
round
the
sun
but
his
hypothesis
did
not
account
for
the
phenomena
as
completely
as
the
current
theory
with
its
his
fellow
astronomers
were
against
him
cleanthes
the
stoic
denounced
him
for
the
hearth
of
the
universe
and
his
heresy
made
little
headway
the
planets
in
their
seven
spheres
surrounding
the
earth
continued
to
be
objects
of
adoration
they
had
their
special
gods
or
guiding
spirits
assigned
them
their
ordered
movements
through
space
it
was
held
produce
a
vast
and
eternal
harmony
it
is
beautiful
beyond
all
earthly
music
this
music
of
the
spheres
beyond
all
human
dreams
of
what
music
might
be
the
only
pity
is
that
except
for
a
few
individuals
in
trances
nobody
has
ever
heard
it
circumstances
seem
always
to
be
unfavourable
it
may
be
that
we
are
too
far
off
though
considering
the
vastness
of
the
orchestra
this
seems
improbable
more
likely
we
are
merely
deaf
to
it
because
it
never
stops
and
we
have
been
in
the
middle
of
it
since
we
first
drew
breath
the
planets
also
become
elements
in
the
kosmos
it
is
significant
that
in
hellenistic
theology
the
word
stoicheion
element
gets
to
mean
a
daemon
as
megathos
greatness
means
an
angel
but
behold

long
been
used
for
the
greek

in

for
the
seven

that
is
no
chance
no
mere
coincidence
the
vowels
are
the
mystic
signs
of
the
planets
they
have
control
over
the
planets
hence
strange
prayers
and
magic
formulae
innumerable
even
the
way
of
reckoning
time
changed
under
the
influence
of
the
planets
instead
of
the
old
division
of
the

into
three
periods
of
nine
days
we
find
gradually
establishing
itself
the
week
of
seven
days
with
each

named
after
its

the
history
of

is
given
by

cassius
xxxvii
in
his
account
of
the
jewish
campaign
of
pompeius
but
it
was
not
the
jewish
week
the
jews
scorned
such
idolatrous
and
polytheistic
proceedings
it
was
the
old
week
of
babylon
the
original
home
of
astronomy
and
for
here
again
a
great
foreign
religion
came
like
water
in
the
desert
to
minds
reluctantly
and
superficially
enlightened
but
secretly
longing
for
the
old
terrors
and
raptures
from
which
they
had
been
set
free
even
in
the
old
days
aeschylus
had
called
the
planets
potentates
shining
in
the
fire
of
heaven
and
euripides
had
spoken
of
the
hurled
from
a
star
but
we
are
told
that
the
first
teaching
of
astrology
in
hellenic
lands
was
in
the
time
of
alexander
when
bÃªrÃ´ssos
the
chaldaean
set
up
a
school
in
cos
and
according
to
seneca
interpretatus
this
must
mean
that
he
translated
into
greek
the
of
a
treatise
in
seventy
tablets
found
in
the
library
of
but
composed
for
sargon
i
in
the
third
millennium
even
the
philosopher
theophrastus
is
reported
by
proclus
as
saying
that
most
extraordinary
thing
of
his
age
was
the
lore
of
the
chaldaeans
who
foretold
not
only
events
of
public
interest
but
even
the
lives
and
deaths
of
individuals
one
wonders
slightly
whether
theophrastus
spoke
with
as
much
implicit
faith
as
proclus
suggests
but
the
chief
account
is
given
by
diodorus
ii
perhaps
from
hecataeus
nations
despise
the
philosophy
of
greece
it
is
so
recent
and
so
constantly
changing
they
have
traditions
which
come
from
vast
antiquity
and
never
change
notably
the
chaldaeans
have
collected
observations
of
the
stars
through
long
ages
and
teach
how
every
event
in
the
heavens
has
its
meaning
as
part
of
the
eternal
scheme
of
divine
forethought
especially
the
seven

and
to
ordinary
men
and
women
beneath
the
seven
are
thirty
gods
of
counsel
half
below
and
half
above
the
earth
every
ten
days
a
messenger
or
angel
star
passes
from
above
below
and
another
from

these
gods
are
twelve
masters
who
are
the
twelve
signs
of
the
zodiac
and
the
planets
pass
through
all
the
houses
of
these
twelve
in
turn
the
chaldaeans
have
made
prophecies
for
various
kings
such
as
alexander
who
conquered
darius
and
antigonus
and
seleucus
nikator
and
have
always
been
right
and
private
persons
who
have
consulted
them
consider
their
wisdom
as
marvellous
and
above
human
power
astrology
fell
upon
the
hellenistic
mind
as
a
new
disease
falls
upon
some
remote
island
people
the
tomb
of
ozymandias
as
described
by
diodorus
i
was
covered
with
astrological
symbols
and
that
of
antiochus
i
which
has
been
discovered
in
commagene
is
of
the
same
character
it
was
natural
for
monarchs
to
believe
that
the
stars
watched
over
them
but
every
one
was
ready
to
receive
the
germ
the
epicureans
of
course
held
out
and
so
did
panaetius
the
coolest
head
among
the
stoics
but
the
stoics
as
a
whole
gave
way
they
formed
with
good
reason
the
leading
school
of
philosophy
and
it
would
have
been
a
service
to
mankind
if
they
had
resisted
but
they
were
already
committed
to
a
belief
in
the
deity
of
the
stars
and
to
the
doctrine
of
heimarmenÃª
or
destiny
they
believed
in
the
pervading
pronoia
or
forethought
of
the
divine
mind
and
in
the
ÏÏÎ¼Ïá½±Î¸ÎµÎ¹Î±
Ïá¿¶Î½
á½Î»ÏÎ½
the
sympathy
of
all
creation
whereby
whatever
happens
to
any
one
part
however
remote
or
insignificant
affects
all
the
rest
it
seemed
only
a
natural
and
beautiful
illustration
of
this
sympathy
that
the
movements
of
the
stars
should
be
bound
up
with
the
sufferings
of
man
they
also
appealed
to
the
general
belief
in
prophecy
and
divination
if
a
prophet
can
foretell
that
such
and
such
an
event
will
happen
then
it
is
obviously
fated
to
happen
foreknowledge
implies
predestination
this
belief
in
prophecy
was
in
reality
a
sort
of
appeal
to
fact
and
to
common
sense
people
could
produce
then
as
they
can
now
a
large
number
of
striking
cases
of
second
sight
presentiment
clairvoyance
actual
prophecy
and
the
like
and
it
was
more
difficult
then
to
test
them
the
argument
involved
stoicism
with
some
questionable
allies
epicureans
and
sceptics
of
the
academy
might
well
mock
at
the
sight
of
a
great
man
like
chrysippus
or
posidonius
resting
an
important
part
of
his
religion
on
the
undetected
frauds
of
a
shady
levantine
still
the
stoics
could
not
but
welcome
the
arrival
of
a
system
of
prophecy
and
predestination
which
however
the
incredulous
might
rail
at
it
possessed
at
least
great
antiquity
and
great
stores
of
learning
which
was
respectable
recondite
and
in
a
way
sublime
in
all
the
religious
systems
of
later
antiquity
if
i
mistake
not
the
seven
planets
play
some
lordly
or
terrifying
part
the
great
mithras
liturgy
unearthed
by
dieterich
from
a
magical
papyrus
in
paris
repeatedly
confronts
the
worshipper
with
the
seven
vowels
as
names
of
seven
deathless
kosmokratores
or
lords
of
the
universe
and
seems
under
their
influence
to
go
off
into
its
maidens
with
heads
of
serpents
in
white
raiment
and
its
divers
other
sevens
the
various
hermetic
and
mithraic
communities
the
naassenes
described
by
hippolytus
and
other
gnostic
bodies
authors
like
macrobius
and
even
cicero
in
his
are
full
of
the
influence
of
the
seven
planets
and
of
the
longing
to
escape
beyond
them
for
by
some
simple
psychological
law
the
stars
which
have
inexorably
pronounced
our
fate
and
decreed
or
at
least
registered
the
decree
that
in
spite
of
all
striving
we
must
needs
tread
their
prescribed
path
still
more
perhaps
the
stars
who
know
in
the
midst
of
our
laughter
how
that
laughter
will
end
become
inevitably
powers
of
evil
rather
than
good
beings
malignant
as
well
as
pitiless
making
life
a
vain
thing
and
saturn
the
chief
of
them
becomes
the
most
malignant
to
some
of
the
gnostics
he
becomes
jaldabaoth
the
god
the
evil
jehovah
the
religion
of
later
antiquity
is
overpoweringly
absorbed
in
plans
of
escape
from
the
prison
of
the
seven
planets
in
author
after
author
in
one
community
after
another
the
subject
recurs
and
on
the
whole
there
is
the
same
answer
here
on
the
earth
we
are
the
sport
of
fate
nay
on
the
earth
itself
we
are
worse
off
still
we
are
beneath
the
moon
and
beneath
the
moon
there
is
not
only
fate
but
something
more
unworthy
and
equally
malignant
chance
to
say
nothing
of
damp
and
the
ills
of
earth
and
bad
daemons
above
the
moon
there
is
no
chance
only
necessity
there
is
the
will
of
the
other
six
kosmokratores
rulers
of
the
universe
but
above
them
all
there
is
an
eighth
region

call
it
simply
the

home
of
the
ultimate
god
whatever

is
named
whose

in

is
true

more
than

there
is
the

us
after

in

in
the

there
are
initiations
sacraments
mystic
ways
of

with

the

death
but
to
see
him
after
due
purification
to
be

to
him
along
the
true
way
by
an
initiating
priest
is
the
ultimate
blessing
of
human
life
it
is
to
die
and
be
born
again
there
were
regular
official
initiations
we
have
one
in
the
more
than
one
in
the
corpus
hermeticum
apuleius
tells
us
at
some
length
though
in
guarded
language
how
he
was
initiated
to
isis
and
became
image
after
much
fasting
clad
in
holy
garments
and
led
by
the
high
priest
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
death
and
passed
through
all
the
elements
the
sun
shone
upon
him
at
midnight
and
he
saw
the
gods
of
heaven
and
of
hades
in
the
morning
he
was
clad
in
the
robe
of
heaven
set
up
on
a
pedestal
in
front
of
the
goddess
and
worshipped
by
the
congregation
as
a
god
he
had
been
made
one
with
osiris
or
horus
or
whatever
name
it
pleased
that
to
be
called
apuleius
does
not
reveal
it
there
were
also
of
course
the
irregular
personal
initiations
and
visions
of
god
vouchsafed
to
persons
of
special
prophetic
powers
paul
we
may
remember
knew
personally
a
man
who
had
actually
been
snatched
up
into
the
third
heaven
and
another
who
was
similarly
rapt
into
paradise
where
he
heard
unspeakable
words
whether
in
the
body
or
not
the
apostle
leaves
undecided
he
himself
on
the
road
to
damascus
had
seen
the
christ
in
glory
not
after
the
flesh
the
philosopher
plotinus
so
his
disciple
tells
us
was
united
with
god
in
trance
four
times
in
five
years
we
seem
to
have
travelled
far
from
the
simplicity
of
early
greek
religion
yet
apart
always
from
plotinus
who
is
singularly
aloof
most
of
the
movement
has
been
a
reaction
under
oriental
and
barbarous
influences
towards
the
most
primitive
cults
the
union
of
man
with
god
came
regularly
through
the
soul
must
get
clear
of
its
body
and
the
god
must
enter
and
dwell
inside
the
worshipper
but
the
means
to
this
union
while
sometimes
allegorized
and
spiritualized
to
the
last
degree
are
sometimes
of
the
most
primitive
sort
the
vagaries
of
religious
emotion
are
apt
to
reach
very
low
as
well
as
very
high
in
the
scale
of
human
nature
certainly
the
primitive
thracian
savages
who
drank
themselves
mad
with
the
hot
blood
of
their
would
have
been
quite
at
home
in
some
of
these
rituals
though
in
others
they
would
have
been
put
off
with
some
substitute
for
the
actual
blood
the
primitive
priestesses
who
waited
in
a
bridal
chamber
for
the
divine
bridegroom
even
the
cretan
kourÃªtes
with
their
zeus
kourÃªs
and
those
strange
hierophants
of
the
house
whose
initiations
are
written
on
the
rocks
of
thera
would
have
found
rites
very
like
their
own
reblossoming
on
earth
after
the
fall
of
hellenism
thyself
as
a
bride
to
receive
her
bridegroom
says
markos
the
gnostic
thou
mayst
be
what
i
am
and
i
what
thou
art
in
thee
and
thou
in
me
is
the
ecstatic
cry
of
one
of
the
hermes
liturgies
before
that
the
prayer
has
been
into
me
as
a
babe
into
the
womb
of
a
woman
in
almost
all
the
liturgies
that
i
have
read
need
is
felt
for
a
mediator
between
the
seeker
after
god
and
his
goal
mithras
himself
saw
a
mesÃ®tÃªs
a
mediator
between
ormuzd
and
ahriman
but
the
ordinary
mediator
is
more
like
an
interpreter
or
an
adept
with
inner
knowledge
which
he
reveals
to
the
outsider
the
circumstances
out
of
which
these
systems
grew
have
left
their
mark
on
the
new
gods
themselves
as
usual
the
social
structure
of
the
worshippers
is
reflected
in
their
objects
of
worship
when
the
chaldaeans
came
to
cos
when
the
thracians
in
the
piraeus
set
up
their
national
worship
of
bendis
when
the
egyptians
in
the
same
port
founded
their
society
for
the
egyptian
ritual
of
isis
when
the
jews
at
assuan
in
the
fifth
century
established
their
own
temple
in
each
case
there
would
come
proselytes
to
whom
the
truth
must
be
explained
and
interpreted
sometimes
perhaps
softened
and
in
each
case
there
is
behind
the
particular
priest
or
initiator
there
present
some
greater
authority
in
the
land
he
comes
from
behind
any
explanation
that
can
be
made
in
the
piraeus
there
is
a
deeper
and
higher
explanation
known
only
to
the
great
master
in
jerusalem
in
egypt
in
babylon
or
perhaps
in
some
unexplored
and
region
of
the
east
this
series
of
revelations
one
behind
the
other
is
a
characteristic
of
all
these
mixed
religions
most
of
the
hermetic
treatises
are
put
in
the
form
of
initiations
or
lessons
revealed
by
a
to
a
by
ptah
to
hermes
by
hermes
to
thoth
or
asclepios
and
by
one
of
them
to
us
it
was
an
ancient
formula
a
natural
vehicle
for
traditional
wisdom
in
egypt
where
the
young
priest
became
regularly
the
of
the
old
priest
it
is
a
form
that
we
find
in
greece
itself
as
early
as
euripides
whose
melanippe
says
of
her
cosmological
doctrines
is
not
my
word
but
my
mother
word
it
was
doubtless
the
language
of
the
old
to
his
disciple
in
one
fine
liturgy
thoth
wrestles
with
hermes
in
agony
of
spirit
till
hermes
is
forced
to
reveal
to
him
the
path
to
union
with
god
which
he
himself
has
trodden
before
at
the
end
of
the
mithras
liturgy
the
devotee
who
has
passed
through
the
mystic
ordeals
and
seen
his
god
face
to
face
is
told
this
you
can
show
the
way
to
others
but
this
leads
us
to
the
second
great
division
of
our
subject
we
turn
from
the
phenomena
of
the
sky
to
those
of
the
soul
if
what
i
have
written
elsewhere
is
right
one
of
the
greatest
works
of
the
hellenic
spirit
and
especially
of
athens
was
to
insist
on
what
seems
to
us
such
a
commonplace
truism
the
difference
between
man
and
god
sophrosynÃª
in
religion
was
the
message
of
the
classical
age
but
the
ages
before
and
after
had
no
belief
in
such
a
lesson
the
old
was
perhaps
himself
the
first
at
any
rate
the
primeval
kings
and
queens
were
treated
as
divine
just
for
a
few
great
generations
it
would
seem
humanity
rose
to
a
sufficient
height
of
and
to
reject
these
dreams
of
or
megalomania
but
the
effort
was
too
great
for
the
average
world
and
in
a
later
age
nearly
all
the
kings
and
rulers
all
people
in
fact
who
can
command
an
adequate
number
of
flatterers
become
divine
beings
again
let
us
consider
how
it
came
about
first
there
was
the
explicit
recognition
by
the
soberest
philosophers
of
the
divine
element
in
man
soul
aristotle
himself
built
an
altar
to
plato
he
did
nothing
superstitious
he
did
not
call
plato
a
god
but
we
can
see
from
his
beautiful
elegy
to
eudemus
that
he
naturally
and
easily
used
language
of
worship
which
would
seem
a
little
strange
to
us
it
is
the
same
emotion
a
noble
and
just
emotion
on
the
whole
which
led
the
philosophic
schools
to
treat
their
founders
as
and
which
has
peopled
most
of
europe
and
asia
with
the
memories
and
the
worship
of
saints
but
we
should
remember
that
only
a
rare
mind
will
make
its
divine
man
of
such
material
as
plato
the
common
way
to
dazzle
men
eyes
is
a
more
brutal
and
obvious
one
to
people
who
were
at
all
accustomed
to
the
conception
of
a
it
was
difficult
not
to
feel
that
the
conception
was
realized
in
alexander
his
tremendous
power
his
brilliant
personality
his
achievements
beggaring
the
fables
of
the
poets
put
people
in
the
right
mind
for
worship
then
came
the
fact
that
the
kings
whom
he
conquered
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
mostly
regarded
by
their
subjects
as
divine
beings
it
was
easy
it
was
almost
inevitable
for
those
who
worshipped
the
darius
to
feel
that
it
was
no
man
but
a
greater
god
who
had
overthrown
darius
the
incense
which
had
been
burned
before
those
conquered
gods
was
naturally
offered
to
their
conqueror
he
did
not
refuse
it
it
was
not
good
policy
to
do
so
and
is
not
apt
to
be
one
of
the
weaknesses
of
the
born
ruler
but
besides
all
this
if
you
are
to
judge
a
god
by
his
fruits
what
god
could
produce
better
credentials
men
had
often
seen
zeus
defied
with
impunity
they
had
seen
faithful
servants
of
apollo
come
to
bad
ends
but
those
who
defied
alexander
however
great
they
might
be
always
rued
their
defiance
and
those
who
were
faithful
to
him
always
received
their
reward
with
his
successors
the
worship
became
more
official
seleucus
ptolemaeus
antigonus
demetrius
all
in
different
degrees
and
different
styles
are
deified
by
the
acclamations
of
adoring
subjects
ptolemy
philadelphus
seems
to
have
been
the
first
to
claim
definite
divine
honours
during
his
own
life
on
the
death
of
his
wife
in
he
proclaimed
her
deity
and
his
own
as
well
in
the
worship
of
the
theoi
adelphoi
the
brethren
of
course
there
was
flattery
in
all
this
ordinary
lying
flattery
and
its
inevitable
accompaniment
megalomania
any
reading
of
the
personal
history
of
the
ptolemies
the
seleucidae
or
the
caesars
shows
it
but
that
is
not
the
whole
explanation
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
period

the
accumulation
of
capital
and
military
force
in
the
hands
of
individuals
the
ptolemies
and
seleucidae
had
at
any
moment
at
their
disposal
powers
very
much
greater
than
any
pericles
or
nicias
or
lysander
the
folk
of
the
small
cities
of
the
aegean
hinterlands
must
have
felt
towards
these
great
strangers
almost
as
poor
indian
peasants
in
time
of
flood
and
famine
feel
towards
an
english
official
there
were
men
now
on
earth
who
could
do
the
things
that
had
hitherto
been
beyond
the
power
of
man
were
several
cities
thrown
down
by
earthquake
here
was
one
who
by
his
nod
could
build
them
again
famines
had
always
occurred
and
been
mostly
incurable
here
was
one
who
could
without
effort
allay
a
famine
provinces
were
harried
and
wasted
by
habitual
wars
the
eventual
conqueror
had
destroyed
whole
provinces
in
making
the
wars
now
as
he
had
destroyed
he
could
also
save
do
you
mean
by
a
god
the
simple
man
might
say
these
men
are
not
gods
the
only
difference
is
that
these
gods
are
visible
and
the
old
gods
no
man
has
seen

assumed

is
by

the
most
prominent
characteristic
of
the
god
upon

was
it
that
people
really
felt
that
to
save
or
benefit
mankind
was
a
more
godlike
thing
than
to
blast
and

philosophers
have
generally
said
that
and
the
vulgar
pretended
to
believe
them
it
was
at
least
politic
when
ministering
to
the
pride
of
one
of
these
princes
to
remind
him
of
his
mercy
rather
than
of
his
wrath
wendland
in
his
brilliant

calls
attention
to

of
the

who
was
made

in

those
beneath

rule

from
the
beginning
god
born
of
god
and
goddess
like
horus
son
of
isis
and
osiris
who
came
to
the
help
of
his
father
osiris
and
in
his
benevolent
disposition
towards
the
gods
has
consecrated
to
the
temples
revenues
of
silver
and
of
corn
and
has
undergone
many
expenses
in
order
to
lead
egypt
into
the
sunlight
and
give
peace
to
the
temples
and
has
with
all
his
powers
shown
love
of
mankind
when
the
people
of
lycopolis
revolted
we
hear
a
short
time
he
took
the
city
by
storm
and
slew
all
the
impious
who
dwelt
in
it
even
as
hermes
and
horus
son
of
isis
and
osiris
conquered
those
who
of
old
revolted
in
the
same
regions
in
return
for
which
the
gods
have
granted
him
health
victory
power
and
all
other
good
things
the
kingdom
remaining
to
him
and
his
sons
for
time
everlasting
the
conclusion
which
the
priests
draw
from
these
facts
is
that
the
young
king
titles
and
honours
are
insufficient
and
should
be
increased
it
is
a
typical
and
terribly
document
of
the
hellenistic
in
his
appearance
as
king
now
the
early
successors
of
alexander
mostly
professed
themselves
members
of
the
stoic
school
and
in
the
mouth
of
a
stoic
this
doctrine
of
the
potential
divinity
of
man
was
an
inspiring
one
to
them
virtue
was
the
really
divine
thing
in
man
and
the
most
divine
kind
of
virtue
was
that
of
helping
humanity
to
love
and
help
humanity
is
according
to
stoic
doctrine
the
work
and
the
very
essence
of
god
if
you
take
away
pronoia
from
god
says
chrysippus
it
is
like
taking
away
light
and
heat
from
fire
this
doctrine
is
magnificently
expressed
by
pliny
in
a
phrase
that
is
probably
translated
from
posidonius
is
the
helping
of
man
by
man
and
that
is
the
way
to
eternal
glory
the
conception
took
root
in
the
minds
of
many
romans
a
great
roman
governor
often
had
the
chance
of
thus
helping
humanity
on
a
vast
scale
and
liked
to
think
that
such
a
life
opened
the
way
to
heaven
should
conceive
says
cicero
i
gods
as
like
men
who
feel
themselves
born
for
the
work
of
helping
defending
and
saving
humanity
hercules
has
passed
into
the
number
of
the
gods
he
would
never
have
so
passed
if
he
had
not
built
up
that
road
for
himself
while
he
was
among
mankind
i
have
been
using
some
rather
late
authors
though
the
ideas
seem
largely
to
come
from
posidonius
but
before
posidonius
the
sort
of
fact
on
which
we
have
been
dwelling
had
had
its
influence
on
religious
speculation
when
alexander
made
his
conquering
journey
to
india
and
afterwards
was
created
a
god
it
was
impossible
not
to
reflect
that
almost
exactly
the
same
story
was
related
in
myth
about
dionysus
dionysus
had
started
from
india
and
travelled
in
the
other
direction
that
was
the
only
difference
a
flood
of
light
seemed
to
be
thrown
on
all
the
traditional
mythology
which
of
course
had
always
been
a
puzzle
to
thoughtful
men
it
was
impossible
to
believe
it
as
it
stood
and
yet
hard
in
an
age
which
had
not
the
conception
of
any
science
of
mythology
to
think
it
was
all
a
mass
of
falsehood
and
the
great
homer
and
hesiod
no
better
than
liars
but
the
generation
which
witnessed
the
official
deification
of
the
various
seleucidae
and
ptolemies
seemed
suddenly
to
see
light
the
traditional
gods
from
heracles
and
dionysus
up
to
zeus
and
cronos
and
even
ouranos
were
simply
rulers
and
benefactors
of
mankind
who
had
by
their
own
insistence
or
the
gratitude
of
their
subjects
been
transferred
to
the
ranks
of
heaven
for
that
is
the
exact
meaning
of
making
them
divine
they
are
classed
among
the
true
immortals
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
and
corn
and
wine
and
the
everlasting
elements
the
philosophic
romance
of
euhemerus
published
early
in
the
third
century
had
instantaneous
success
and
enormous
influence
it
was
one
of
the
first
greek
books
translated
into
latin
and
became
long
afterwards
a
favourite
weapon
of
the
christian
fathers
in
their
polemics
against
polytheism
was
on
the
face
of
it
a
very
brilliant
theory
and
it
had
as
we
have
noticed
a
special
appeal
for
the
romans
yet
if
such
a
conception
might
please
the
leisure
of
a
statesman
it
could
hardly
satisfy
the
serious
thought
of
a
philosopher
or
a
religious
man
if
man
soul
really
holds
a
fragment
of
god
and
is
itself
a
divine
being
its
godhead
can
not
depend
on
the
possession
of
great
riches
and
armies
and
organized
subordinates
if
helping
of
man
by
man
is
god
the
help
in
question
can
not
be
material
help
the
religion
which
ends
in
deifying
only
kings
and
millionaires
may
be
vulgarly
popular
but
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
whole
tendency
of
greek
philosophy
after
plato
with
some
illustrious
exceptions
especially
among
the
romanizing
stoics
was
away
from
the
outer
world
towards
the
world
of
the
soul
we
find
in
the
religious
writings
of
this
period
that
the
real
saviour
of
men
is
not
he
who
protects
them
against
earthquake
and
famine
but
he
who
in
some
sense
saves
their
souls
he
reveals
to
them
the
the
knowledge
of
god
the
in
question
is
not
a
mere
intellectual
knowledge
it
is
a
complete
union
a
merging
of
beings
and
as
we
have
always
to
keep
reminding
our
cold
modern
intelligence
he
who
has
god
is
himself
thereby
deified
he
is
the
image
of
god
the
son
of
god
in
a
sense
he
god
the
stratum
of
ideas
described
in
the
first
of
the
studies
will
explain
the
ease
with
which
transition
took
place
the
worshipper
of
bacchos
became
bacchos
simply
enough
because
in
reality
the
god
bacchos
was
originally
only
the
projection
of
the
human
bacchoi
and
in
the
hellenistic
age
the
notion
of
these
secondary
mediating
gods
was
made
easier
by
the
analogy
of
the
human
interpreters
of
course
we
have
abundant
instances
of
actual
preachers
and
who
on
their
own
authority
posed
and
were
accepted
as
gods
the
adventure
of
paul
and
barnabas
at
lystra
shows
how
easily
such
things
could
happen
but
as
a
rule
i
suspect
the
most
zealous
priest
or
preacher
preferred
to
have
his
god
in
the
background
he
preaches
he
heals
the
sick
and
casts
out
devils
not
in
his
own
name
but
in
the
name
of
one
who
sent
him
this
actual
present
priest
who
initiates
you
or
me
is
himself
already
an
image
of
god
but
above
him
there
are
greater
and
wiser
priests
above
them
others
and
above
all
there
is
the
one
eternal
divine
mediator
who
being
in
perfection
both
man
and
god
can
alone
fully
reveal
god
to
man
and
lead
man
soul
up
the
heavenly
path
beyond
change
and
fate
and
the
houses
of
the
seven
rulers
to
its
ultimate
peace
i
have
seen
somewhere
a
gnostic
or
early
christian
emblem
which
indicates
this
doctrine
some
shepherd
or
saviour
stands
his
feet
on
the
earth
his
head
towering
above
the
planets
lifting
his
follower
in
his
outstretched
arms
the
gnostics
are
still
commonly
thought
of
as
a
body
of
christian
heretics
in
reality
there
were
gnostic
sects
scattered
over
the
hellenistic
world
before
christianity
as
well
as
after
they
must
have
been
established
in
antioch
and
probably
in
tarsus
well
before
the
days
of
paul
or
apollos
their
saviour
like
the
jewish
messiah
was
established
in
men
minds
before
the
saviour
of
the
christians
we
look
close
says
professor
bousset
result
emerges
with
great
clearness
that
the
figure
of
the
redeemer
as
such
did
not
wait
for
christianity
to
force
its
way
into
the
religion
of
gnÃ´sis
but
was
already
present
there
under
various
forms
he
occurs
notably
in
two
documents
discovered
by
the
keen
analysis
and
profound
learning
of
reitzenstein
the
poimandres
revelation
printed
in
the
and
the
sermon
of
the
naassenes
in
hippolytus
omnium
which
is
combined
with
the
violent
bias
of
most
of
the
sects
they
speak
of
accursed
god
of
the
jews
and
identify
him
with
saturn
and
the
devil
points
on
the
whole
to
conditions
and
a
completely
standpoint
is
still
visible
in
the
mandaean
and
manichean
systems
their
redeemer
is
descended
by
a
fairly
clear
genealogy
from
the
sÃ´tÃªr
of
early
greece
contaminated
with
similar
figures
like
attis
and
adonis
from
asia
minor
osiris
from
egypt
and
the
special
jewish
conception
of
the
messiah
of
the
chosen
people
he
has
various
names
which
the
name
of
jesus
or
anointed
tends
gradually
to
supersede
above
all
he
is
in
some
sense
man
or
second
or
son
of
man
the
origin
of
this
phrase
needs
a
word
of
explanation
since
the
ultimate
unseen
god
spirit
though
he
is
made
man
in
his
image
since
holy
men
and
divine
kings
are
images
of
god
it
follows
that
he
is
himself
man
he
is
the
real
the
ultimate
the
perfect
and
eternal
man
of
whom
all
bodily
men
are
feeble
copies
he
is
also
the
father
the
saviour
is
his
son
image
of
the
father
second
man
son
of
man
the
method
in
which
he
performs
his
mystery
of
redemption
varies
it
is
haunted
by
the
memory
of
the
old
suffering
and
dying
god
of
whom
we
spoke
in
the
first
of
these
studies
it
is
vividly
affected
by
the
ideal
man
of
plato
who
be
scourged
tortured
bound
his
eyes
burnt
out
and
at
last
after
suffering
every
evil
shall
be
impaled
or
crucified
but
in
the
main
he
descends
of
his
free
will
or
by
the
eternal
purpose
of
the
father
from
heaven
through
the
spheres
of
all
the
archontes
or
kosmokratores
the
planets
to
save
mankind
or
sometimes
to
save
the
fallen
virgin
the
soul
wisdom
or
pearl
the
archontes
let
him
pass
because
he
is
disguised
they
do
not
know
him
cf
cor
ii
when
his
work
is
done
he
ascends
to
heaven
to
sit
by
the
side
of
the
father
in
glory
he
conquers
the
archontes
leads
them
captive
in
his
triumph
strips
them
of
their
armour
ii
cf
the
previous
verse
sometimes
even
crucifies
them
for
ever
in
their
places
in
the
sky
the
epistles
to
the
colossians
and
the
ephesians
are
much
influenced
by
these
doctrines
paul
himself
constantly
uses
the
language
of
them
but
in
the
main
we
find
him
discouraging
the
excesses
of
superstition
reforming
ignoring
rejecting
his
jewish
blood
was
perhaps
enough
to
keep
him
to
strict
monotheism
though
he
admits
angels
and
archontes
principalities
and
powers
he
scorns
the
elements
and
he
seems
deliberately
to
reverse
the
doctrine
of
the
first
and
second
man
he
says
nothing
about
the
trinity
of
divine
beings
that
was
usual
in
gnosticism
nothing
about
the
divine
mother
his
mind
for
all
its
vehement
mysticism
has
something
of
that
clean
antiseptic
quality
that
makes
such
early
christian
works
as
the
octavius
of
minucius
felix
and
the
epistle
to
diognetus
so
infinitely
refreshing
he
is
certainly
one
of
the
great
figures
in
greek
literature
but
his
system
lies
outside
the
subject
of
this
essay
we
are
concerned
only
with
those
last
manifestations
of
hellenistic
religion
which
probably
formed
the
background
of
his
philosophy
it
is
a
strange
experience
and
it
shows
what
queer
stuff
we
humans
are
made
of
to
study
these
obscure
congregations
drawn
from
the
proletariate
of
the
levant
superstitious
and
helplessly
ignorant
who
still
believed
in
gods
begetting
children
of
mortal
mothers
who
took
the
the
and
the
wisdom
to
be
persons
called
by
those
names
and
turned
the
immortality
of
the
soul
into
standing
up
of
the
corpses
and
to
reflect
that
it
was
these
who
held
the
main
road
of
advance
towards
the
greatest
religion
of
the
western
world
i
have
tried
to
sketch
in
outline
the
main
forms
of
belief
to
which
hellenistic
philosophy
moved
or
drifted
let
me
dwell
for
a
few
pages
more
upon
the
characteristic
method
by
which
it
reached
them
it
may
be
summed
up
in
one
word
allegory
all
hellenistic
philosophy
from
the
first
stoics
onward
is
permeated
by
allegory
it
is
applied
to
homer
to
the
religious
traditions
to
the
ancient
rituals
to
the
whole
world
to
sallustius
after
the
end
of
our
period
the
whole
material
world
is
only
a
great
myth
a
thing
whose
value
lies
not
in
itself
but
in
the
spiritual
meaning
which
it
hides
and
reveals
to
cleanthes
at
the
beginning
of
it
the

was
a
mystic
pageant

which
the
immortal
stars
were

principles

applied
allegory
in
detail
to
his
interpretation

complete
treatises

well
the
results
of
this

a
brilliant
little
work
of
the
first
century
i
will
not
dwell
upon
details
they
are
abundantly
accessible
and
individually
often
ridiculous
a
of
the
same
activity
is
the
mystic
treatment
of
language
a

and
or

and
is
this
totally
absurd
i
think
not
if
all
human
language
is
as
most
of
these
thinkers
believed
a
divine
institution
a
cap
filled
to
the
brim
with
divine
meaning
so
that
by
reflecting
deeply
upon
a
word
a
pious
philosopher
can
reach
the
secret
that
it
holds
then
there
is
no
difficulty
whatever
in
supposing
that
the
special
secret
held
by
an
egyptian
word
may
be
found
in
greek
or
the
secret
of
a
greek
word
in
babylonian
language
is
one
the
gods
who
made
all
these
languages
equally
could
use
them
all
and
wind
them
all
intricately
in
and
out
for
the
building
up
of
their
divine
enigma
we
must
make
a
certain
effort
of
imagination
to
understand
this
method
of
allegory
it
is
not
the
frigid
thing
that
it
seems
to
us
in
the
first
place
we
should
remember
that
as
applied
to
the
ancient
literature
and
religious
ritual
allegory
was
at
least
a
it
was
a
phenomenon
which
actually
existed
heraclitus
of
ephesus
is
an
obvious
instance
he
deliberately
expressed
himself
in
language
which
should
not
be
understood
of
the
vulgar
and
which
bore
a
hidden
meaning
to
his
disciples
pythagoras
did
the
same
the
prophets
and
religious
writers
must
have
done
so
to
an
even
greater
extent
and
we
know
enough
of
the
history
of
ritual
to
be
sure
that
a
great
deal
of
it
is
definitely
allegorical
the
hellenistic
age
did
not
wantonly
invent
the
theory
of
allegory
and
secondly
we
must
remember
what
states
of
mind
tend
especially
to
produce
this
kind
of
belief
they
are
not
contemptible
states
of
mind
it
needs
only
a
strong
idealism
with
which
the
facts
of
experience
clash
and
allegory
follows
almost
of
necessity
the
facts
can
not
be
accepted
as
they
are
they
must
needs
be
explained
as
meaning
something
different
take
an
earnest
stoic
or
platonist
a
man
of
fervid
mind
who
is
possessed
by
the
ideals
of
his
philosophy
and
at
the
same
time
feels
his
heart
thrilled
by
the
beauty
of
the
old
poetry
what
is
he
to
do
on
one
side
he
can
find
zoilus
or
plato
himself
or
the
cynic
preachers
condemning
homer
and
the
poets
without
remorse
as
teachers
of
foolishness
he
can
treat
poetry
as
the
english
puritans
treated
the
stage
but
is
that
a
satisfactory
solution
remember
that
these
generations
were
trained
habitually
to
give
great
weight
to
the
voice
of
their
inner
consciousness
and
the
inner
consciousness
of
a
sensitive
man
cries
out
that
any
such
solution
is
false
that
homer
is
not
a
liar
but
noble
and
great
as
our
fathers
have
always
taught
us
on
the
other
side
comes
heraclitus
the
allegorist
homer
used
no
allegories
he
committed
all
impieties
on
this
theory
the
words
can
be
allowed
to
possess
all
their
old
beauty
and
magic
but
an
inner
meaning
is
added
quite
different
from
that
which
they
bear
on
the
surface
it
may
very
likely
be
a
duller
and
less
poetic
meaning
but
i
am
not
sure
that
the
verses
will
not
gain
by
the
mere
process
of
brooding
study
fully
as
much
as
they
lose
by
the
ultimate
badness
of
the
interpretation
anyhow
that
was
the
road
followed
the
men
of
whom
i
speak
were
not
likely
to
give
up
any
experience
that
seemed
to
make
the
world
more
godlike
or
to
feed
their
spiritual
and
emotional
cravings
they
left
that
to
the
barefooted
cynics
they
craved
poetry
and
they
craved
philosophy
if
the
two
spoke
like
enemies
their
words
must
needs
be
explained
away
by
one
who
loved
both
the
same
process
was
applied
to
the
world
itself
something
like
it
is
habitually
applied
by
the
religious
idealists
of
all
ages
a
fundamental
doctrine
of
stoicism
and
most
of
the
idealist
creeds
was
the
perfection
and
utter
blessedness
of
the
world
and
the
absolute
fulfilment
of
the
purpose
of
god
now
obviously
this
belief
was
not
based
on
experience
the
poor
world
to
do
it
justice
amid
all
its
misdoings
has
never
lent
itself
to
any
such
barefaced
deception
as
that
no
doubt
it
shrieked
against
the
doctrine
then
as
loud
as
it
has
always
shrieked
so
that
even
a
posidonian
or
a
pythagorean
his
ears
straining
for
the
music
of
the
spheres
was
sometimes
forced
to
listen
and
what
was
his
answer
it
is
repeated
in
all
the
literature
of
these
sects
human
experience
is
so
small
the
things
of
the
earth
may
be
bad
and
more
than
bad
but
ah
if
you
only
went
beyond
the
moon
that
is
where
the
true
kosmos
begins
and
of
course
if
we
did
ever
go
there
we
all
know
they
would
say
it
began
beyond
the
sun
idealism
of
a
certain
type
will
have
its
way
if
hard
life
produces
an
ounce
or
a
pound
or
a
million
tons
of
fact
in
the
scale
against
it
it
merely
dreams
of
infinite
millions
in
its
own
scale
and
the
enemy
is
outweighed
and
smothered
i
do
not
wish
to
mock
at
these
posidonian
stoics
and
hermetics
and
gnostics
and
they
loved
goodness
and
their
faith
is
strong
and
even
terrible
one
feels
rather
inclined
to
bow
down
before
their
altars
and
cry
est
delusio
et
yet
on
the
whole
one
rises
from
these
books
with
the
impression
that
all
this
allegory
and
mysticism
is
bad
for
men
it
may
make
the
emotions
sensitive
it
certainly
weakens
the
understanding
and
of
course
in
this
paper
i
have
left
out
of
account
many
of
the
grosser
forms
of
superstition
in
any
consideration
of
the
balance
they
should
not
be
forgotten
if
a
reader
of
proclus
and
the
wants
relief
he
will
find
it
perhaps
best
in
the
writings
of
a
gentle
old
epicurean
who
lived
at
oenoanda
in
cappadocia
about
his
name
was
diogenes
his
works
are
preserved
in
a
fragmentary
state
not
on
papyrus
or
parchment
but
on
the
wall
of
a
large
portico
where
he
engraved
them
for
to
read
he
lived
in
a
world
of
superstition
and
foolish
terror
and
he
wrote
up
the
great
doctrines
of
epicurus
for
the
saving
of
mankind
brought
by
age
to
the
sunset
of
my
life
and
expecting
at
any
moment
to
take
my
departure
from
the
world
with
a
glad
song
for
the
fullness
of
my
happiness
i
have
resolved
lest
i
be
taken
too
soon
to
give
help
to
those
of
good
temperament
if
one
person
or
two
or
three
or
four
or
any
small
number
you
choose
were
in
distress
and
i
were
summoned
out
to
help
one
after
another
i
would
do
all
in
my
power
to
give
the
best
counsel
to
each
but
now
as
i
have
said
the
most
of
men
lie
sick
as
it
were
of
a
pestilence
in
their
false
beliefs
about
the
world
and
the
tale
of
them
increases
for
by
imitation
they
take
the
disease
from
one
another
like
sheep
and
further
it
is
only
just
to
bring
help
to
those
who
shall
come
after
us
for
they
too
are
ours
though
they
be
yet
unborn
and
love
for
man
commands
us
also
to
help
strangers
who
may
pass
by
since
therefore
the
good
message
of
the
book
has
this
wall
and
to
set
forth
in
public
the
medicine
of
the
healing
of
mankind
the
people
of
his
time
and
neighbourhood
seem
to
have
fancied
that
the
old
man
must
have
some
bad
motive
they
understood
mysteries
and
redemptions
and
revelations
they
understood
magic
and
curses
but
they
were
puzzled
apparently
by
this
simple
message
which
only
told
them
to
use
their
reason
their
courage
and
their
sympathy
and
not
to
be
afraid
of
death
or
of
angry
gods
the
doctrine
was
condensed
into
four
sentences
of
a
concentrated
eloquence
that
make
a
translator
despair
to
fear
in
god
nothing
to
feel
in
death
good
can
be
attained
evil
can
be
endured
of
course
the
doctrines
of
this
good
old
man
do
not
represent
the
whole
truth
to
be
guided
by
one
aversions
is
always
a
sign
of
weakness
or
defeat
and
it
is
as
much
a
failure
of
nerve
to
reject
blindly
for
fear
of
being
a
fool
as
to
believe
blindly
for
fear
of
missing
some
emotional
stimulus
there
is
no
royal
road
in
these
matters
i
confess
it
seems
strange
to
me
as
i
write
here
to
reflect
that
at
this
moment
many
of
my
friends
and
most
of
my
fellow
creatures
are
as
far
as
one
can
judge
quite
confident
that
they
possess
supernatural
knowledge
as
a
rule
each
individual
belongs
to
some
body
which
has
received
in
writing
the
results
of
a
divine
revelation
i
can
not
share
in
any
such
feeling
the
uncharted
surrounds
us
on
every
side
and
we
must
needs
have
some
relation
towards
it
a
relation
which
will
depend
on
the
general
discipline
of
a
man
mind
and
the
bias
of
his
whole
character
as
far
as
knowledge
and
conscious
reason
will
go
we
should
follow
resolutely
their
austere
guidance
when
they
cease
as
cease
they
must
we
must
use
as
best
we
can
those
fainter
powers
of
apprehension
and
surmise
and
sensitiveness
by
which
after
all
most
high
truth
has
been
reached
as
well
as
most
high
art
and
poetry
careful
always
really
to
seek
for
truth
and
not
for
our
own
emotional
satisfaction
careful
not
to
neglect
the
real
needs
of
men
and
women
through
basing
our
life
on
dreams
and
remembering
above
all
to
walk
gently
in
a
world
where
the
lights
are
dim
and
the
very
stars
wander

that
this
conception
has
its
roots
deep
in
primitive
human
nature
birth
of

would
perhaps
be
fanciful
to
say
that
man
tends
to
run
away
from
the
sacred
as
uncanny
to
cower
before
it
as
secret
and
to
prostrate
himself
before
it
as
tabu
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
plain
that
to
these
three
negative
qualities
of
the
sacred
taken
together
there
corresponds
on
the
part
of
man
a
certain
negative
attitude
of
mind
psychologists
class
the
feelings
bound
up
with
flight
cowering
and
prostration
under
the
common
head
of
asthenic
emotion
in
plain
english
they
are
all
forms
of
of
feeling
unstrung
this
general
type
of
innate
disposition
would
seem
to
be
the
psychological
basis
of
humility
taken
in
its
social
setting
the
emotion
will
of
course
show
endless
shades
of
complexity
for
it
will
be
excited
and
again
will
find
practical
expression
in
all
sorts
of
ways
under
these
varying
conditions
however
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
what
mcdougall
would
call
the
central
part
of
the
experience
remains
very
much
the
same
in
face
of
the
sacred
the
normal
man
is
visited
by
a
a
wave
of
asthenic
emotion
marett
continues
that
were
all
however
religion
would
be
a
matter
of
pure
fear
but
it
is
not
all
there
is
yet
the
positive
side
of
the
sacred
to
be
taken
into
account
it
is
worth
remarking
also
that
schleiermacher
placed
the
essence
of
religion
in
the
feeling
of
absolute
dependence
without
attempting
to
define
the
object

which
it

i
regret
to
say
that
i
can
not
track
this
epicurean
to
its
source
v
the
last
protest
in
the
last
essay
we
have
followed
greek
popular
religion
to
the
very
threshold
of
christianity
till
we
found
not
only
a
soil
ready
for
the
seed
of
christian
metaphysic
but
a
large
number
of
the
plants
already
in
full
and
exuberant
growth
a
complete
history
of
greek
religion
ought
without
doubt
to
include
at
least
the
rise
of
christianity
and
the
growth
of
the
orthodox
church
but
of
course
the
present
series
of
studies
does
not
aim
at
completeness
we
will
take
the
christian
theology
for
granted
as
we
took
the
classical
greek
philosophy
and
will
finish
with
a
brief
glance
at
the
pagan
reaction
of
the
fourth
century
when
the
old
religion
already
full
of
allegory
mysticism
asceticism
and
oriental
influences
raised
itself
for
a
last
indignant
stand
against
the
deniers
of
the
gods
this
period
however
admits
a
rather
simpler
treatment
than
the
others
it
so
happens
that
for
the
last
period
of
paganism
we
actually
possess
an
authoritative
statement
of
doctrine
something
between
a
creed
and
a
catechism
it
seems
to
me
a
document
so
singularly
important
and
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
so
little
known
that
i
shall
venture
to
print
it
entire
a
creed
or
catechism
is
of
course
not
at
all
the
same
thing
as
the
real
religion
of
those
who
subscribe
to
it
the
rules
of
metre
are
not
the
same
thing
as
poetry
the
rules
of
cricket
if
the
analogy
may
be
excused
are
not
the
same
thing
as
good
play
nay
more
a
man
states
in
his
creed
only
the
articles
which
he
thinks
it
right
to
assert
positively
against
those
who
think
otherwise
his
deepest
and
most
practical
beliefs
are
those
on
which
he
acts
without
question
which
have
never
occurred
to
him
as
being
open
to
doubt
if
you
take
on
the
one
hand
a
number
of
persons
who
have
accepted
the
same
creed
but
lived
in
markedly
different
ages
and
societies
with
markedly
different
standards
of
thought
and
conduct
and
on
the
other
an
equal
number
who
profess
different
creeds
but
live
in
the
same
general
environment
i
think
there
will
probably
be
more
real
identity
of
religion
in
the
latter
group
take
three
orthodox
christians
enlightened
according
to
the
standards
of
their
time
in
the
fourth
the
sixteenth
and
the
twentieth
centuries
respectively
i
think
you
will
find
more
profound
differences
of
religion
between
them
than
between
a
methodist
a
catholic
a
freethinker
and
even
perhaps
a
buddhist
or
brahmin
at
the
present
day
provided
you
take
the
most
generally
enlightened
representatives
of
each
class
still
when
a
student
is
trying
to
understand
the
inner
religion
of
the
ancients
he
realizes
how
immensely
valuable
a
creed
or
even
a
regular
liturgy
would
be
literature
enables
us
sometimes
to
approach
pretty
close
in
various
ways
to
the
minds
of
certain
of
the
great
men
of
antiquity
and
understand
how
they
thought
and
felt
about
a
good
many
subjects
at
times
one
of
these
subjects
is
the
accepted
religion
of
their
society
we
can
see
how
they
criticized
it
or
rejected
it
but
it
is
very
hard
to
know
from
their
reaction
against
it
what
that
accepted
religion
really
was
who
for
instance
knows
herodotus
religion
he
talks
in
his
penetrating
and
garrulous
way
for
children
and
sometimes
for
philosophers
as
gibbon
puts
it
about
everything
in
the
world
but
at
the
end
of
his
book
you
find
that
he
has
not
opened
his
heart
on
this
subject
no
doubt
his
profession
as
a
reciter
and
prevented
him
we
can
see
that
thucydides
was
sceptical
but
can
we
fully
see
what
his
scepticism
was
directed
against
or
where
for
instance
nikias
would
have
disagreed
with
him
and
where
he
and
nikias
both
agreed
against
us
we
have
of
course
the
systems
of
the
great
philosophers
especially
of
plato
and
aristotle
better
than
either
perhaps
we
can
make
out
the
religion
of
aurelius
amid
all
the
harshness
and
plainness
of
his
literary
style
marcus
possessed
a
gift
which
has
been
granted
to
few
the
power
of
writing
down
what
was
in
his
heart
just
as
it
was
not
obscured
by
any
consciousness
of
the
presence
of
witnesses
or
any
striving
after
effect
he
does
not
seem
to
have
tried
deliberately
to
reveal
himself
yet
he
has
revealed
himself
in
that
short
personal
almost
as
much
as
the
great
inspired
egotists
rousseau
and
augustine
true
there
are
some
passages
in
the
book
which
are
unintelligible
to
us
that
is
natural
in
a
work
which
was
not
meant
to
be
read
by
the
public
broken
flames
of
the
white
passion
that
consumed
him
bursting
through
the
armour
of
his
habitual
accuracy
and
people
fail
to
understand
marcus
not
because
of
his
lack
of
but
because
it
is
hard
for
most
men
to
breathe
at
that
intense
height
of
spiritual
life
or
at
least
to
breathe
soberly
they
can
do
it
if
they
are
allowed
to
abandon
themselves
to
floods
of
emotion
and
to
lose
and
i
am
often
rather
surprised
at
good
critics
speaking
of
marcus
as
there
is
as
much
intensity
of
feeling
in
Ïá½°
Îµá¼°Ï
á¼Î±ÏÏá½¹Î½
as
in
most
of
the
nobler
modern
books
of
religion
only
there
is
a
sterner
power
controlling
it
the
feeling
never
amounts
to
complete
guiding
never
trembles
upon
its
throne
and
the
emotion
is
severely
purged
of
earthly
dross
that
being
so
we
children
of
earth
respond
to
it
less
readily
still
whether
or
no
we
can
share
marcus
religion
we
can
at
any
rate
understand
most
of
it
but
even
then
we
reach
only
the
personal
religion
of
a
very
extraordinary
man
we
are
not
much
nearer
to
the
religion
of
the
average
educated
person
the
background
against
which
marcus
like
plato
ought
to
stand
out
i

that
our
conceptions

it

and
various
our
who
read
and
were
better
informed
than
we
but
there
are
many
large
and
apparently
simple
questions
about
which
even
after
reading
cicero
philosophical
translations
scholars
probably
feel
quite
uncertain
were
the
morals
of
epictetus
or
the
morals
of
part
v
of
the
anthology
most
near
to
those
of
real
life
among
respectable
persons
are
there
not
subjects
on
which
plato
himself
sometimes
makes
our
flesh
creep
what
are
we
to
feel
about
slavery
about
the
exposing
of
children
true
slavery
was
not
peculiar
to
antiquity
it
flourished
in
a
civilized
and
peculiarly
humane
people
of
english
blood
till
a
generation
ago
and
the
history
of
infanticide
among
the
finest
modern
nations
is
such
as
to
make
one
reluctant
to
throw
stones
and
even
doubtful
in
which
direction
to
throw
them
still
these
great
facts
and
others
like
them
have
to
be
understood
and
are
rather
hard
to
understand
in
their
bearing
on
the
religious
life
of
the
ancients
points
of
minor
morals
again
are
apt
to
surprise
a
reader
of
ancient
literature
we
must
remember
of
course
that
they
always
do
surprise
one
in
every
age
of
history
as
soon
as
its
manners
are
studied
in
detail
one
need
not
go
beyond
salimbene
chronicle
one
need
hardly
go
beyond
macaulay
history
or
any
of
the
famous
french
memoirs
to
realize
that
was
it
really
an
ordinary
thing
in
the
first
century
as
philo
seems
to
say
for
gentlemen
at
to
black
one
another
eyes
or
bite
one
another
ears
off
or
were
such
practices
confined
to
some
smart
set
or
was
philo
for
his
own
purposes
using
some
particular
scandalous
occurrence
as
if
it
was
typical
augustine
mentions
among
the
virtues
of
his
mother
her
unusual
meekness
and
tact
although
her
husband
had
a
fiery
temper
she
never
had
bruises
on
her
face
which
made
her
a
among
the
matrons
of
her
circle
her
circle
presumably
included
christians
as
well
as
pagans
and
manicheans
and
philo
circle
can
scarcely
be
considered
pagan
indeed
as
for
the
difference
of
religion
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
just
at
the
time
we
are
about
to
consider
the
middle
of
the
fourth
century
the
conduct
of
the
christians
either
to
the
rest
of
the
world
or
to
one
another
was
very
far
from
evangelical
ammianus
says
that
no
savage
beasts
could
equal
its
cruelty
ammianus
was
a
pagan
but
gregory
himself
says
it
was
like
hell
i
have
expressed
elsewhere
my
own
general
answer
to
this
puzzle
not
only
in
early
greek
times
but
throughout
the
whole
of
antiquity
the
possibility
of
all
sorts
of
absurd
and
atrocious
things
lay
much
nearer
the
protective
forces
of
society
were
much
weaker
the
strain
on
personal
character
the
need
for
real
and
virtue
was
much
greater
than
it
is
at
the
present
day
that
is
one
of
the
causes
that
make
antiquity
so
interesting
of
course
different
periods
of
antiquity
varied
greatly
both
in
the
conventional
standard
demanded
and
in
the
spiritual
force
which
answered
or
surpassed
the
demand
but
in
general
the
strong
governments
and
orderly
societies
of
modern
europe
have
made
it
infinitely
easier
for
men
of
no
particular
virtue
to
live
a
decent
life
infinitely
easier
also
for
men
of
no
particular
reasoning
power
or
scientific
knowledge
to
have
a
more
or
less
scientific
or
sane
view
of
the
world
that
however
does
not
carry
us
far
towards
solving
the
main
problem
it
brings
us
no
nearer
to
knowledge
of
anything
that
we
may
call
typically
a
religious
creed
or
an
authorized
code
of
morals
in
any
age
from
hesiod
to
aurelius
the
book
which
i
have
ventured
to
call
a
creed
or
catechism
is
the
work
of
sallustius
the
gods
and
the
a
book
i
should
say
about
the
length
of
the
scottish
shorter
catechism
it
is
printed
in
the
third
volume
of
mullach
apart
from
that
the
only
edition
generally
accessible
and
that
is
rare
is
a
duodecimo
published
by
allatius
in
orelli
brochure
of
seems
to
be
unprocurable
the
author
was
in
all
probability
that
sallustius
who
is
known
to
us
as
a
close
friend
of
julian
before
his
accession
and
a
backer
or
inspirer
of
the
emperor
efforts
to
restore
the
old
religion
he
was
concerned
in
an
educational
edition
of
sophocles
the
seven
selected
plays
now
extant
with
a
commentary
he
was
given
the
rank
of
prefect
in
that
of
consul
in
one
must
remember
of
course
that
in
that
rigorous
and
ascetic
court
high
rank
connoted
no
pomp
or
luxury
julian
had
dismissed
the
thousand
hairdressers
the
innumerable
cooks
and
eunuchs
of
his
christian
predecessor
it
probably
brought
with
it
only
an
increased
obligation
to
live
on
pulse
and
to
do
without
such
pamperings
of
the
body
as
fine

his

a

upon
the
departure
of

he
had
been
with
julian
in
the
wars
in
gaul
and
was
recalled
by
the
jealousy
of
the
emperor
constantius
it
is
a
touching
and
even
a
noble
treatise
the
nervous
which
was
habitual
in
julian
makes
him
write
always
with
a
certain
affectation
but
no
one
could
mistake
the
real
feeling
of
loss
and
loneliness
that
runs
through
the
consolation
he
has
lost
his
in
the
ranks
and
now
is
left
alone
so
he
writes
quoting
the

malignant
men
were
always
aiming
at
you
or
rather
at
me
trying
to
wound
me
through
you
and
believing
that
the
only
way
to
beat
me
down
was
by
depriving
me
of
the
fellowship
of
my
true
friend
and
the
comrade
who
never
flinched
from
sharing
my
dangers
one
note
recurs
four
times
he
has
lost
the
one
man
to
whom
he
could
talk
as
a
brother
the
man
of
and
clean
who
was
honest
and
unafraid
and
able
to
contradict
the
emperor
freely
because
of
their
mutual
trust
if
one
thinks
of
it
julian
for
all
his
gentleness
must
have
been
an
alarming
emperor
to
converse
with
his
standard
of
conduct
was
not
only
uncomfortably
high
it
was
also
a
little
unaccountable
the
most
correct
and
blameless
court
officials
must
often
have
suspected
that
their
master
looked
upon
them
as
simply
wallowing
in
sin
and
that
feeling
does
not
promote
ease
or
truthfulness
julian
compares
his
friendship
with
sallustius
to
that
of
scipio
and

people
said
of

it
little
matters
who
suggested
and
who
agreed
to
the
suggestion
his
thoughts
and
any
credit
that
came
from
the
thoughts
are
his
friend
as
much
as
his
own
we
happen
to
hear
from
the
christian
theodoret
iii
that
on
one
occasion
when
julian
was
nearly
goaded
into
persecution
of
the
christians
it
was
sallustius
who
recalled
him
to
their
fixed
policy
of
toleration
sallustius
then
may
be
taken
to
represent
in
the
most
authoritative
way
the
pagan
reaction
of
julian
time
in
its
final
struggle
against
christianity
he
was
roughly
speaking
a
but
it
is
not
as
a
professed
philosopher
that
he
writes
it
is
only
that
had
permeated
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
age
the
strife
of
the
philosophical
sects
had
almost
ceased
just
as
julian
mysticism
made
all
gods
and
almost
all
forms
of
worship
into
one
so
his
enthusiasm
for
hellenism
revered
nay
idolized
almost
all
the
great
philosophers
of
the
past
they
were
all
trying
to
say
the
same
ineffable
thing
all
lifting
mankind
towards
the
knowledge
of
god
i
say
in
both
cases
for
the
christians
are
outside
the
pale
in
one
domain
and
the
epicureans
and
a
few
cynics
in
the
other
both
had
committed
the
cardinal
sin
they
had
denied
the
gods
they
are
sometimes
lumped
together
as
voilÃ 
this
may
surprise
us
at
first
sight
but
the
explanation
is
easy
to
julian
the
one
great
truth
that
matters
is
the
presence
and
glory
of
the
gods
no
doubt
they
are
all
ultimately
one
they
are
Î´ÏÎ½á½±Î¼ÎµÎ¹Ï
not
persons
but
for
reasons
above
our
comprehension
they
are
manifest
only
under
conditions
of
form
time
and
personality
and
have
so
been
revealed
and
worshipped
and
partly
known
by
the
great
minds
of
the
past
in
julian
mind
the
religious
emotion
itself
becomes
the
thing
to
live
for
every
object
that
has
been
touched
by
that
emotion
is
thereby
glorified
and
made
sacred
every
shrine
where
men
have
worshipped
in
truth
of
heart
is
thereby
a
house
of
god
the
worship
may
be
mixed
up
with
all
sorts
of
folly
all
sorts
of
unedifying
practice
such
things
must
be
purged
away
or
still
better
must
be
properly
understood
for
to
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
and
the
myths
that
shock
the
vulgar
are
noble
allegories
to
the
wise
and
reverent
purge
religion
from
dross
if
you
like
but
remember
that
you
do
so
at
your
peril
one
false
step
one
rejection
of
a
thing
which
is
merely
too
high
for
you
to
grasp
and
you
are
darkening
the
sun
casting
god
out
of
the
world
and
that
was
just
what
the
christians
deliberately
did
in
many
of
the
early
christian
writings
denial
is
a
much
greater
element
than
assertion
the
beautiful
of
minucius
felix
about
is
an
example
such
denial
was
of
course
to
our
judgement
eminently
needed
and
rendered
a
great
service
to
the
world
but
to
julian
it
seemed
impiety
in
other
christian
writings
the
misrepresentation
of
pagan
rites
and
beliefs
is
decidedly
and
malicious
quite
apart
from
his
personal
wrongs
and
his
contempt
for
the
character
of
constantius
julian
could
have
no
sympathy
for
men
who
overturned
altars
and
heaped
blasphemy
on
old
deserted
shrines
defilers
of
every
sacred
object
that
was
not
protected
by
popularity
the
most
that
such
people
could
expect
from
him
was
that
they
should
not
be
proscribed
by
law
but
meantime
what
were
the
multitudes
of
the
to
believe
the
arm
of
the
state
was
not
very
strong
or
effective
labour
as
he
might
to
supply
good
teaching
to
all
provincial
towns
julian
could
not
hope
to
educate
the
poor
and
ignorant
to
understand
plato
and
aurelius
for
them
he
seems
to
say
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
they
should
be
pious
and
in
their
own
way
but
for
more
or
less
educated
people
not
blankly
ignorant
and
yet
not
professed
students
of
philosophy
there
might
be
some
simple
and
authoritative
treatise
issued
a
sort
of
reasoned
creed
to
lay
down
in
a
convincing
manner
the
outlines
of
the
old
hellenic
religion
before
the
christians
and
atheists
should
have
swept
all
fear
of
the
gods
from
off
the
earth
the
treatise
is
this
work
of
sallustius
the
christian
fathers
from
minucius
felix
onward
have
shown
us
what
was
the
most
vulnerable
point
of
paganism
the
traditional
mythology
sallustius
deals
with
it
at
once
the
or
pupil
he
says
in
section
needs
some
preliminary
training
he
should
have
been
well
brought
up
should
not
be
incurably
stupid
and
should
not
have
been
familiarized
with
foolish
fables
evidently
the
mythology
was
not
to
be
taught
to
children
he
enunciates
certain
postulates
of
religious
thought
viz
that
god
is
always
good
and
not
subject
to
passion
or
to
change
and
then
proceeds
straight
to
the
traditional
myths
in
the
first
place
he
insists
that
they
are
what
he
calls
that
is
they
are
inspired
or
have
some
touch
of
divine
truth
in
them
this
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
they
have
been
uttered
and
sometimes
invented
by
the
most
inspired
poets
and
philosophers
and
by
the
gods
themselves
in
oracles
a
very
characteristic
argument
the
myths
are
all
expressions
of
god
and
of
the
goodness
of
god
but
they
follow
the
usual
method
of
divine
revelation
to
wit
mystery
and
allegory
the
myths
state
clearly
the
one
tremendous
fact
that
the
gods
that
is
what
julian
cared
about
and
the
christians
denied
they
are
the
myths
reveal
only
to
those
who
have
understanding
world
itself
is
a
great
myth
in
which
bodies
and
inanimate
things
are
visible
souls
and
minds
invisible
admitting
all
this
how
comes
it
that
the
myths
are
so
often
absurd
and
even
immoral
for
the
usual
purpose
of
mystery
and
allegory
in
order
to
make
people
think
the
soul
that
wishes
to
know
god
must
make
its
own
effort
it
can
not
expect
simply
to
lie
still
and
be
told
the
myths
by
their
obvious
falsity
and
absurdity
on
the
surface
stimulate
the
mind
capable
of
religion
to
probe
deeper
he
proceeds
to
give
instances
and
chooses
at
once
myths
that
had
been
for
generations
the
mock
of
the
sceptic
and
in
his
own
day
furnished
abundant
ammunition
for
the
artillery
of
christian
polemic
he
takes
first
hesiod
story
of
kronos
swallowing
his
children
then
the
judgement
of
paris
then
comes
a
long
and
earnest
explanation
of
the
myth
of
attis
and
the
mother
of
the
gods
it
is
on
the
face
of
it
a
story
highly
discreditable
both
to
the
heart
and
the
head
of
those
august
beings
and
though
the
rites
themselves
do
not
seem
to
have
been
in
any
way
improper
the
christians
naturally
attacked
the
pagans
and
julian
personally
for
countenancing
the
worship
explanation
is
taken
directly
from
julian
fifth
oration
in
praise
of
the
great
mother
and
reduces
the
myth
and
the
ritual
to
an
expression
of
the
adventures
of
the
soul
seeking
god
so
much
for
the
whole
traditional
mythology
it
has
been
explained
completely
away
and
made
subservient
to
philosophy
and
edification
while
it
can
still
be
used
as
a
great
of
religious
emotion
for
the
explanations
given
by
sallustius
and
julian
are
never
rationalistic
they
never
stimulate
a
spirit
of
scepticism
always
a
spirit
of
mysticism
and
reverence
and
lest
by
chance
even
this
reverent
theorizing
should
have
been
somehow
lacking
in
insight
or
true
piety
sallustius
ends
with
the
prayer
i
say
these
things
concerning
the
myths
may
the
gods
themselves
and
the
spirits
of
those
who
wrote
the
myths
be
gracious
to
me
he
now
leaves
mythology
and
turns
to
the
first
cause
it
must
be
one
and
it
must
be
present
in
all
things
thus
it
can
not
be
life
for
if
it
were
all
things
would
be
alive
by
a
platonic
argument
in
which
he
will
still
find
some
philosophers
to
follow
him
he
proves
that
everything
which
exists
exists
because
of
some
goodness
in
it
and
thus
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
the
first
cause
is
Ïá½¸
á¼Î³Î±Î¸á½¹Î½
the

the

are

the

are

above

next
comes

that

of

next
that
the

next
a
definition
of

a
fairly
skilful
piece
of
dialectic
dealing
with
a
hopeless
difficulty
next
come

and
in
a
dead
and
perfunctory
echo
of

an
enumeration
of
the
good
and
bad
forms
of
human
society
the
questions
which
vibrated
with

in

athens
had
become
meaningless
to
a

then
follows
more
adventurous
matter
first
a
chapter
headed
evil

come
and
that
there
is
no
evil
is
not
a
real
thing
is
perhaps
best
he
says
observe
at
once
that
since
the
gods
are
good
and
make
everything
there
is
no
positive
evil
there
is
only
absence
of
good
just
as
there
is
no
positive
darkness
only
absence
of

what
we
call
arise
only
in
the
activities
of
men
and
even
here
no
one
ever
does
evil
for
the
sake
of
evil
who
indulges
in
some
pleasant
vice
thinks
the
vice
bad
but
his
pleasure
good
a
murderer
thinks
the
murder
bad
but
the
money
he
will
get
by
it

one
who
injures
an
enemy
thinks
the
injury
bad
but
the
being
quits
with
his
enemy
good
and
so
on
the
evil
acts
are
all
done
for
the
sake
of
some
good
but
human
souls
being
very
far
removed
from
the
original
flawless
divine
nature
make
mistakes
or
sins
one
of
the
great
objects
of
the
world
he
goes
on
to
explain
of
gods
men
and
spirits
of
religious
institutions
and
human
laws
alike
is
to
keep
the
souls
from
these
errors
and
to
purge
them
again
when
they
have
fallen
next
comes
a
speculative
difficulty
sallustius
has
called
the
world
in
the
fullest
sense
that
is
it
always
has
been
and
always
will
be
and
yet
it
is
by
the
gods
how
are
these
statements
compatible
if
it
was
made
there
must
have
been
a
time
before
it
was
made
the
answer
is
ingenious
it
is
not
made
by
handicraft
as
a
table
is
it
is
not
begotten
as
a
son
by
a
father
it
is
the
result
of
a
quality
of
god
just
as
light
is
the
result
of
a
quality
of
the
sun
the
sun
causes
light
but
the
light
is
there
as
soon
as
the
sun
is
there
the
world
is
simply
the
other
side
as
it
were
of
the
goodness
of
god
and
has
existed
as
long
as
that
goodness
has
existed
next
come
some
simpler
questions
about
man
relation
to
the
gods
in
what
sense
do
we
say
that
the
gods
are
angry
with
the
wicked
or
are
appeased
by
repentance
sallustius
is
quite
firm
the
gods
can
not
ever
be
glad
for
that
which
is
glad
is
also
sorry
can
not
be
angry
for
anger
is
a
passion
and
obviously
they
can
not
be
appeased
by
gifts
or
prayers
even
men
if
they
are
honest
require
higher
motives
than
that
god
is
unchangeable
always
good
always
doing
good
if
we
are
good
we
are
nearer
to
the
gods
and
we
feel
it
if
we
are
evil
we
are
separated
further
from
them
it
is
not
they
that
are
angry
it
is
our
sins
that
hide
them
from
us
and
prevent
the
goodness
of
god
from
shining
into
us
if
we
repent
again
we
do
not
make
any
change
in
god
we
only
by
the
conversion
of
our
soul
towards
the
divine
heal
our
own
badness
and
enjoy
again
the
goodness
of
the
gods
to
say
that
the
gods
turn
away
from
the
wicked
would
be
like
saying
that
the
sun
turns
away
from
a
blind
man
why
then
do
we
make
offerings
and
sacrifices
to
the
gods
when
the
gods
need
nothing
and
can
have
nothing
added
to
them
we
do
so
in
order
to
have
more
communion
with
the
gods
the
whole
temple
service
in
fact
is
an
elaborate
allegory
a
representation
of
the
divine
government
of
the
world
the
custom
of
sacrificing
animals
had
died
out
some
time
before
this
the
jews
of
the
dispersion
had
given
it
up
long
since
because
the
law
forbade
any
such
sacrifice
outside
the
temple
when
jerusalem
was
destroyed
jewish
sacrifice
ceased
altogether
the
christians
seem
from
the
beginning
to
have
generally
followed
the
jewish
practice
but
sacrifice
was
in
itself
not
likely
to
continue
in
a
society
of
large
towns
it
meant
turning
your
temples
into
very
and
was
also
associated
with
a
great
deal
of
muddled
and
indiscriminate
charity
one
might
have
hoped
that
men
so
and
spiritual
as
julian
and
sallustius
would
have
considered
this
practice
unnecessary
or
even
have
reformed
it
away
but
no
it
was
part
of
the
genuine
hellenic
tradition
and
no
jot
or
tittle
of
that
tradition
should
if
they
could
help
it
be
allowed
to
die
sacrifice
is
desirable
argues
sallustius
because
it
is
a
gift
of
life
god
has
given
us
life
as
he
has
given
us
all
else
we
must
therefore
pay
to
him
some
emblematic
tithe
of
life
again
prayers
in
themselves
are
merely
words
but
with
sacrifice
they
are
words
plus
life
living
words
lastly
we
are
life
of
a
sort
and
god
is
life
of
an
infinitely
higher
sort
to
approach
him
we
need
always
a
medium
or
a
mediator
the
medium
between
life
and
life
must
needs
be
life
we
find
that
life
in
the
sacrificed
animal
the
argument
shows
what
ingenuity
these
religious
men
had
at
their
command
and
what
trouble
they
would
take
to
avoid
having
to
face
a
fact
and
reform
a
bad
system
there
follows
a
long
and
rather
difficult
argument
to
show
that
the
world
is
in
itself
eternal
the
former
discussion
on
this
point
had
only
shown
that
the
gods
would
not
destroy
it
this
shows
that
its
own
nature
is
indestructible
the
arguments
are
very
inconclusive
though
clever
and
one
wonders
why
the
author
is
at
so
much
pains
indeed
he
is
so
earnest
that
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
he
finds
it
necessary
to
apologize
to
the
kosmos
in
case
his
language
should
have
been
indiscreet
the
reason
i
think
is
that
the
christians
were
still
as
in
apostolic
times
pinning
their
faith
to
the
approaching
end
of
the
world
by
fire
they
announced
the
end
of
the
world
as
near
and
they
rejoiced
in
the
prospect
of
its
destruction
history
has
shown
more
than
once
what
terrible
results
can
be
produced
by
such
beliefs
as
these
in
the
minds
of
excitable
and
suffering
populations
especially
those
of
eastern
blood
it
was
widely
believed
that
christian
fanatics
had
from
time
to
time
actually
tried
to
light
fires
which
should
consume
the
accursed
world
and
thus
hasten
the
coming
of
the
kingdom
which
should
bring
such
incalculable
rewards
to
their
own
organization
and
plunge
the
rest
of
mankind
in
everlasting
torment
to
any
respectable
pagan
such
action
was
an
insane
crime
made
worse
by
a
diabolical
motive
the
destruction
of
the
world
therefore
seems
to
have
become
a
subject
of
profound
irritation
if
not
actually
of
terror
at
any
rate
the
doctrine
lay
at
the
very
heart
of
the
and
sallustius
uses
his
best
dialectic
against
it
the
title
of
chapter
xviii
has
a
somewhat
pathetic
ring
are
atheisms
or
rejections
of
god
and
that
god
is
not
injured
thereby
Î¸Îµá½¸Ï
Î¿á½
Î²Î»á½±ÏÏÎµÏÎ±Î¹
over
certain
parts
of
the
world
there
have
occurred
and
will
occur
more
hereafter
rejections
of
the
gods
a
wise
man
need
not
be
disturbed
at
that
we
have
always
known
that
the
human
soul
was
prone
to
error
god
providence
is
there
but
we
can
not
expect
all
men
at
all
times
and
places
to
enjoy
it
equally
in
the
human
body
it
is
only
the
eye
that
sees
the
light
the
rest
of
the
body
is
ignorant
of
the
light
so
are
many
parts
of
the
earth
ignorant
of
god
very
likely
also
this
rejection
of
god
is
a
punishment
persons
who
in
a
previous
life
have
known
the
gods
but
disregarded
them
are
perhaps
now
born
as
it
were
blind
unable
to
see
god
persons
who
have
committed
the
blasphemy
of
worshipping
their
own
kings
as
gods
may
perhaps
now
be
cast
out
from
the
knowledge
of
god
philosophy
had
always
rejected
the
especially
in
the
form
of
but
opposition
to
christianity
no
doubt
intensifies
the
protest
the
last
chapter
is
very
short
that
have
lived
in
virtue
being
otherwise
blessed
and
especially
separated
from
their
irrational
part
and
purged
of
all
body
are
joined
with
the
gods
and
sway
the
whole
world
together
with
them
so
far
triumphant
faith
then
the
of
the
brave
man
who
means
to
live
his
best
life
even
if
faith
fail
him
even
if
none
of
these
rewards
came
to
them
still
virtue
itself
and
the
joy
and
glory
of
virtue
and
the
life
that
is
subject
to
no
grief
and
no
master
would
be
enough
to
make
blessed
those
who
have
set
themselves
to
live
in
virtue
and
have
succeeded
there
the
book
ends
it
ends
upon
that
paradox
which
from
the
second
book
of
the
onwards
seems
to
have
brought
so
much
comfort
to
the
nobler
spirits
of
the
ancient
world
strange
how
we
moderns
can
not
rise
to
it
we
seem
simply
to
lack
the
intensity
of
moral
enthusiasm
when
we
speak
of
martyrs
being
happy
on
the
rack
in
the
first
place
we
rarely
believe
it
and
in
the
second
we
are
usually
supposing
that
the
rack
will
soon
be
over
and
that
harps
and
golden
crowns
will
presently
follow
the
ancient
moralist
believed
that
the
good
man
was
happy
then
and
there
because
the
joy
being
in
his
soul
was
not
affected
by
the
torture
of
his
body
not
being
able
fully
to
feel
this
conviction
we
naturally
incline
to
think
it
affected
or
unreal
but
taking
the
conditions
of
the
ancient
world
into
account
we
must
admit
that
the
men
who
uttered
this
belief
at
least
understood
better
than
most
of
us
what
suffering
was
many
of
them
were
slaves
many
had
been
captives
of
war
they
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
i
think
on
a
careful
study
of
aurelius
epictetus
and
some
of
these
philosophers
that
we
shall
be
forced
to
realize
that
these
men
could
rise
to
much
the
same
heights
of
religious
heroism
as
the
catholic
saints
of
the
middle
age
and
that
they
often
did
so
if
i
may
use
such
a
phrase
on
a
purer
and
thinner
diet
of
sensuous
emotion
with
less
wallowing
in
the
dust
and
less
delirium
be
that
as
it
may
we
have
now
seen
in
outline
the
kind
of
religion
which
ancient
paganism
had
become
at
the
time
of
its
final
reaction
against
christianity
it
is
a
more
or
less
intelligible
whole
and
succeeds
better
than
most
religions
in
combining
two
great
appeals
it
appeals
to
the
philosopher
and
the
thoughtful
man
as
a
fairly
complete
and
rational
system
of
thought
which
speculative
and
enlightened
minds
in
any
age
might
believe
without
disgrace
i
do
not
mean
that
it
is
probably
true
to
me
all
these
overpowering
optimisms
which
by
means
of
a
few
untested
postulates
affect
triumphantly
to
disprove
the
most
obvious
facts
of
life
seem
very
soon
to
become
meaningless
i
conceive
it
to
be
no
comfort
at
all
to
a
man
suffering
agonies
of
frostbite
to
be
told
by
science
that
cold
is
merely
negative
and
does
not
exist
so
far
as
the
statement
is
true
it
is
irrelevant
so
far
as
it
pretends
to
be
relevant
it
is
false
i
only
mean
that
a
system
like
that
of
sallustius
is
judged
by
any
standard
high
civilized
and
enlightened
at
the
same
time
this
religion
appeals
to
the
ignorant
and
the
it
takes
from
the
pious
villager
no
single
object
of
worship
that
has
turned
his
thoughts
heavenwards
it
may
explain
and
purge
it
never
condemns
or
ridicules
in
its
own
eyes
that
was
its
great
glory
in
the
eyes
of
history
perhaps
its
most
fatal
weakness
christianity
apart
from
its
positive
doctrines
had
inherited
from
judaism
the
noble
courage
of
its
disbeliefs
to
compare
this
paganism
in
detail
with
its
great
rival
would
be
even
if
i
possessed
the
necessary
learning
a
laborious
and
unsatisfactory
task
but
if
a
student
with
very
imperfect
knowledge
may
venture
a
personal
opinion
on
this
obscure
subject
it
seems
to
me
that
we
often
look
at
such
problems
from
a
wrong
angle
harnack
somewhere
in
discussing
the
comparative
success
or
failure
of
various
early
christian
sects
makes
the
illuminating
remark
that
the
main
determining
cause
in
each
case
was
not
their
comparative
reasonableness
of
doctrine
or
skill
in
controversy
for
they
practically
never
converted
one
another
but
simply
the
comparative
increase
or
decrease
of
the
in
the
respective
populations
on
somewhat
similar
lines
it
always
appears
to
me
that
historically
speaking
the
character
of
christianity
in
these
early
centuries
is
to
be
sought
not
so
much
in
the
doctrines
which
it
professed
nearly
all
of
which
had
their
roots
and
their
close
parallels
in
older
hellenistic
or
hebrew
thought
but
in
the
organization
on
which
it
rested
for
my
own
part
when
i
try
to
understand
christianity
as
a
mass
of
doctrines
gnostic
trinitarian
monophysite
arian
and
the
rest
i
get
no
further
when
i
try
to
realize
it
as
a
sort
of
society
for
mutual
help
with
a
mystical
religious
basis
resting
first
on
the
proletariates
of
antioch
and
the
great
commercial
and
manufacturing
towns
of
the
levant
then
spreading
by
instinctive
sympathy
to
similar
classes
in
rome
and
the
west
and
rising
in
influence
like
certain
other
mystical
cults
by
the
special
appeal
it
made
to
women
the
various
historical
puzzles
begin
to
fall
into
place
among
other
things
this
explains
the
strange
subterranean
power
by
which
the
emperor
diocletian
was
baffled
and
to
which
the
pretender
constantine
had
to
capitulate
it
explains
its
humanity
its
intense
feeling
of
brotherhood
within
its
own
bounds
its
incessant
care
for
the
poor
and
also
its
comparative
indifference
to
the
virtues
which
are
specially
incumbent
on
a
governing
class
such
as
statesmanship
moderation
truthfulness
active
courage
learning
culture
and
public
spirit
of
course
such
indifference
was
only
comparative
after
the
time
of
constantine
the
governing
classes
come
into
the
fold
bringing
with
them
their
normal
qualities
and
thereafter
it
is
paganism
not
christianity
that
must
uphold
the
flag
of
a
desperate
fidelity
in
the
face
of
a
hostile
world
a
task
to
which
naturally
enough
paganism
was
not
equal
but
i
never
wished
to
pit
the
two
systems
against
one
another
the
battle
is
over
and
it
is
poor
work
to
jeer
at
the
wounded
and
the
dead
if
we
read
the
literature
of
the
time
especially
some
records
of
the
martyrs
under
diocletian
we
shall
at
first
perhaps
imagine
that
apart
from
some
startling
exceptions
the
conquered
party
were
all
vicious
and
hateful
the
conquerors
all
wise
and
saintly
then
looking
a
little
deeper
we
shall
see
that
this
great
controversy
does
not
stand
altogether
by
itself
as
in
other
wars
each
side
had
its
wise
men
and
its
foolish
its
good
men
and
its
evil
like
other
conquerors
these
conquerors
were
often
treacherous
and
brutal
like
other
vanquished
these
vanquished
have
been
tried
at
the
bar
of
history
without
benefit
of
counsel
have
been
condemned
in
their
absence
and
died
with
their
lips
sealed
the
polemic
literature
of
christianity
is
loud
and
triumphant
the
books
of
the
pagans
have
been
destroyed
only
an
ignorant
man
will
pronounce
a
violent
or
bitter
judgement
here
the
minds
that
are
now
tender
timid
and
reverent
in
their
orthodoxy
would
probably
in
the
third
or
fourth
century
have
sided
with
the
old
gods
those
of
more
daring
and
puritan
temper
with
the
christians
the
historian
will
only
try
to
have
sympathy
and
understanding
for
both
they
are
all
dead
now
diocletian
and
ignatius
cyril
and
hypatia
julian
and
basil
athanasius
and
arÃ®us
every
party
has
yielded
up
its
persecutors
and
its
martyrs
its
hates
and
slanders
and
aspirations
and
heroisms
to
the
arms
of
that
great
silence
whose
secrets
they
all
claimed
so
loudly
to
have
read
even
the
dogmas
for
which
they
fought
might
seem
to
be
dead
too
for
if
julian
and
sallustius
gregory
and
john
chrysostom
were
to
rise
again
and
see
the
world
as
it
now
is
they
would
probably
feel
their
personal
differences
melt
away
in
comparison
with
the
vast
difference
between
their
world
and
this
they
fought
to
the
death
about
this
credo
and
that
but
the
same
spirit
was
in
all
of
them
in
the
words
of
one
who
speaks
with
greater
knowledge
than
mine
most
inward
man
in
these
four
contemporaries
is
the
same
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
fourth
century

the

asceticism
all
through
antiquity
the
fight
against
luxury
was
a
fiercer
and
stronger
fight
than
comes
into
our
modern
experience
there
was
not
more
objective
luxury
in
any
period
of
ancient
history
than
there
is
now
there
was
never
anything
like
so
much
but
there
does
seem
to
have
been
more
subjective
abandonment
to
physical
pleasure
and
concomitantly
a
stronger
protest
against
it
from
some
time
before
the
christian
era
it
seems
as
if
the
subconscious
instinct
of
humanity
was
slowly
rousing
itself
for
a
great
revolt
against
the
long
intolerable
tyranny
of
the
senses
over
the
soul
and
by
the
fourth
century
the
revolt
threatened
to
become
the
emperor
julian
was
probably
as
proud
of
his
fireless
cell
and
the
crowding
lice
in
his
beard
and
cassock
as
an
average
egyptian
monk
the
ascetic
movement
grew
as
we
all
know
to
be
measureless
and
insane
it
seemed
to
be
almost
another
form
of
lust
and
to
have
the
same
affinities
with
cruelty
but
it
has
probably
rendered
priceless
help
to
us
who
come
afterwards
the
insane
ages
have
often
done
service
for
the
sane
the
harsh
and
suffering
ages
for
the
gentle
and
however
we
try
to
translate
it
temperance
gentleness
the
spirit
that
in
any
trouble
thinks
and
is
patient
that
saves
and
not
destroys
is
the
right
spirit
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
none
of
these
leaders
neither
the
fierce
bishops
with
their
homilies
on
charity
nor
julian
and
sallustius
with
their
worship
of
hellenism
came
very
near
to
that
classic
ideal
to
bring
back
that
note
of
sophrosynÃª
i
will
venture
before
proceeding
to
the
pagan
creed
to
give
some
sentences
from
an
earlier
pagan
prayer
it
is
cited
by
stobaeus
from
a
certain
eusebius
a
late
ionic
platonist
of
whom
almost
nothing
is
known
not
even
the
date
at
which
he
lived
but
the
voice
sounds
like
that
of
a
stronger
and
more
sober
age
i
be
no
man
enemy
it
begins
may
i
be
the
friend
of
that
which
is
eternal
and
abides
may
i
never
quarrel
with
those
nearest
to
me
and
if
i
do
may
i
be
reconciled
quickly
may
i
never
devise
evil
against
any
man
if
any
devise
evil
against
me
may
i
escape
uninjured
and
without
the
need
of
hurting
him
may
i
love
seek
and
attain
only
that
which
is
good
may
i
wish
for
all
men
happiness
and
envy
none
may
i
never
rejoice
in
the
of
one
who
has
wronged
me
when
i
have
done
or
said
what
is
wrong
may
i
never
wait
for
the
rebuke
of
others
but
always
rebuke
myself
until
i
make
amends
may
i
win
no
victory
that
harms
either
me
or
my
opponent
may
i
reconcile
friends
who
are
wroth
with
one
another
may
i
to
the
extent
of
my
power
give
all
needful
help
to
my
friends
and
to
all
who
are
in
want
may
i
never
fail
a
friend
in
danger
when
visiting
those
in
grief
may
i
be
able
by
gentle
and
healing
words
to
soften
their
pain
may
i
respect
myself
may
i
always
keep
tame
that
which
rages
within
me
may
i
accustom
myself
to
be
gentle
and
never
be
angry
with
people
because
of
circumstances
may
i
never
discuss
who
is
wicked
and
what
wicked
things
he
has
done
but
know
good
men
and
follow
in
their
footsteps
there
is
more
of
it
how
unpretending
it
is
and
yet
how
searching
and
in
the
whole
there
is
no
petition
for
any
material
blessing
and
most
striking
of
all
it
is
addressed
to
no
personal
god
it
is
pure
prayer
of
course
to
some
it
will
feel
thin
and
cold
most
men
demand
of
their
religion
more
outward
and
personal
help
more
physical
ecstasy
a
more
heady
atmosphere
of
illusion
no
one
man
attitude
towards
the
uncharted
can
be
quite
the
same
as
his
neighbour
in
part
instinctively
in
part
superficially
and
each
generation
of
mankind
reacts
against
the
last
the
grown
man
turns
from
the
lights
that
were
thrust
upon
his
eyes
in
childhood
the
son
shrugs
his
shoulders
at
the
watchwords
that
thrilled
his
father
and
with
varying
degrees
of
sensitiveness
or
dullness
of
fuller
or
more
fragmentary
experience
writes
out
for
himself
the
manuscript
of
his
creed
yet
even
for
the
wildest
or
bravest
rebel
that
manuscript
is
only
a
palimpsest
on
the
surface
all
is
new
writing
clean
and
underneath
dim
but
indelible
in
the
very
fibres
of
the
parchment
lie
the
characters
of
many
ancient
aspirations
and
raptures
and
battles
which
his
conscious
mind
has
rejected

utterly
forgotten

forgotten

there

life
in

will
sometimes
return
out

vivid

still

humanity
a

the
disciple
should
be
and
concerning
common
those
who
wish
to
hear
about
the
gods
should
have
been
well
guided
from
childhood
and
not
habituated
to
foolish
beliefs
they
should
also
be
in
disposition
good
and
sensible
that
they
may
properly
attend
to
the
teaching
they
ought
also
to
know
the
common
conceptions
common
conceptions
are
those
to
which
all
men
agree
as
soon
as
they
are
asked
for
instance
that
all
god
is
good
free
from
passion
free
from
change
for
whatever
suffers
change
does
so
for

or

god
is
unchanging
unbegotten
eternal
incorporeal
and
not
in
let
the
disciple
be
thus
let
the
teachings
be
of
the
following
sort
the
essences
of
the
gods
never
came
into
existence
for
that
which
always
is
never
comes
into
existence
and
that
exists
for
ever
which
possesses
primary
force
and
by
nature
suffers
nothing
neither
do
they
consist
of
bodies
for
even
in
bodies
the
powers
are
incorporeal
neither
are
they
contained
by
space
for
that
is
a
property
of
bodies
neither
are
they
separate
from
the
first
cause
nor
from
one
another
just
as
thoughts
are
not
separate
from

nor
acts

from

soul
iii
myths
that
they
are
divine
and
we
may
well
inquire
then
why
the
ancients
forsook
these
doctrines
and
made
use
of
myths
there
is
this
first
benefit
from
myths
that
we
have
to
search
and
do
not
have
our
minds
idle
the
myths
are
divine
can
be
seen
from
those
who
have
used
them
myths
have
been
used
by
inspired
poets
by
the
best
of
philosophers
by
those
who
established
the
mysteries
and
by
the
gods
themselves
in
oracles
but
the
myths
are
divine
it
is
the
duty
of
philosophy
to
inquire
since
all
existing
things
rejoice
in
that
which
is
like
them
and
reject
that
which
is
unlike
the
stories
about
the
gods
ought
to
be
like
the
gods
so
that
they
may
both
be
worthy
of
the
divine
essence
and
make
the
gods
well
disposed
to
those
who
speak
of
them
which
could
only
be
done
by
means
of
myths
now
the
myths
represent
the
gods
themselves
and
the
goodness
of
the
gods
subject
always
to
the
distinction
of
the
speakable
and
the
unspeakable
the
revealed
and
the
unrevealed
that
which
is
clear
and
that
which
is
hidden
since
just
as
the
gods
have
made
the
goods
of
sense
common
to
all
but
those
of
intellect
only
to
the
wise
so
the
myths
state
the
existence
of
gods
to
all
but
who
and
what
they
are
only
to
those
who
can
understand
they
also
represent
the
activities
of
the
gods
for
one
may
call
the
world
a
myth
in
which
bodies
and
things
are
visible
but
souls
and
minds
hidden
besides
to
wish
to
teach
the
whole
truth
about
the
gods
to
all
produces
contempt
in
the
foolish
because
they
can
not
understand
and
lack
of
zeal
in
the
good
whereas
to
conceal
the
truth
by
myths
prevents
the
contempt
of
the
foolish
and
compels
the
good
to
practise
philosophy
but
why
have
they
put
in
the
myths
stories
of
adultery
robbery
and
all
the
other
absurdity
is
not
that
perhaps
a
thing
worthy
of
admiration
done
so
that
by
means
of
the
visible
absurdity
the
soul
may
immediately
feel
that
the
words
are
veils
and
believe
the
truth
to
be
a
mystery
iv
the
species
of
myth
are
five
with
examples
of
of
myths
some
are
theological
some
physical
some
psychic
and
again
some
material
and
some
mixed
from
these
last
two
the
theological
are
those
myths
which
use
no
bodily
form
but
contemplate
the
very
essences
of
the
gods
kronos
swallowing
his
children
since
god
is
intellectual
and
all
intellect
returns
into
itself
this
myth
expresses
in
allegory
the
essence
of
god
myths
may
be
regarded
physically
when
they
express
the
activities
of
the
gods
in
the
world
people
before
now
have
regarded
kronos
as
time
and
calling
the
divisions
of
time
his
sons
say
that
the
sons
are
swallowed
by
the
father
the
psychic
way
is
to
regard
the
activities
of
the
soul
itself
the
soul
acts
of
thought
though
they
pass
on
to
other
objects
nevertheless
remain
inside
their
begetters
the
material
and
last
is
that
which
the
egyptians
have
mostly
used
owing
to
their
ignorance
believing
material
objects
actually
to
be
gods
and
so
calling
them
they
call
the
earth
isis
moisture
osiris
heat
typhon
or
again
water
kronos
the
fruits
of
the
earth
adonis
and
wine
dionysus
to
say
that
these
objects
are
sacred
to
the
gods
like
various
herbs
and
stones
and
animals
is
possible
to
sensible
men
but
to
say
that
they
are
gods
is
the
notion
of
madmen
except
perhaps
in
the
sense
in
which
both
the
orb
of
the
sun
and
the
ray
which
comes
from
the
orb
are
colloquially
called
sun
the
mixed
kind
of
myth
may
be
seen
in
many
instances
for
example
they
say
that
in
a
banquet
of
the
gods
discord
threw
down
a
golden
apple
the
goddesses
contended
for
it
and
were
sent
by
zeus
to
paris
to
be
judged
paris
saw
aphrodite
to
be
beautiful
and
gave
her
the
apple
here
the
banquet
signifies
the
powers
of
the
gods
that
is
why
they
are
all
together
the
golden
apple
is
the
world
which
being
formed
out
of
opposites
is
naturally
said
to
be
by
discord
the
different
gods
bestow
different
gifts
upon
the
world
and
are
thus
said
to
for
the
apple
and
the
soul
which
lives
according
to
sense
for
that
is
what
paris
is
not
seeing
the
other
powers
in
the
world
but
only
beauty
declares
that
the
apple
belongs
to
aphrodite
theological
myths
suit
philosophers
physical
and
psychic
suit
poets
mixed
suit
religious
initiations
since
every
initiation
aims
at
uniting
us
with
the
world
and
the
gods
to
take
another
myth
they
say
that
the
mother
of
the
gods
seeing
attis
lying
by
the
river
gallus
fell
in
love
with
him
took
him
crowned
him
with
her
cap
of
stars
and
thereafter
kept
him
with
her
he
fell
in
love
with
a
nymph
and
left
the
mother
to
live
with
her
for
this
the
mother
of
the
gods
made
attis
go
mad
and
cut
off
his
genital
organs
and
leave
them
with
the
nymph
and
then
return
and
dwell
with
her
now
the
mother
of
the
gods
is
the
principle
that
generates
life
that
is
why
she
is
called
mother
attis
is
the
creator
of
all
things
which
are
born
and
die
that
is
why
he
is
said
to
have
been
found
by
the
river
gallus
for
gallus
signifies
the
galaxy
or
milky
way
the
point
at
which
body
subject
to
passion
begins
now
as
the
primary
gods
make
perfect
the
secondary
the
mother
loves
attis
and
gives
him
celestial
powers
that
is
what
the
cap
means
attis
loves
a
nymph
the
nymphs
preside
over
generation
since
all
that
is
generated
is
fluid
but
since
the
process
of
generation
must
be
stopped
somewhere
and
not
allowed
to
generate
something
worse
than
the
worst
the
creator
who
makes
these
things
casts
away
his
generative
powers
into
the
creation
and
is
joined
to
the
gods
again
now
these
things
never
happened
but
always
are
and
mind
sees
all
things
at
once
but
reason
or
speech
expresses
some
first
and
others
after
thus
as
the
myth
is
in
accord
with
the
cosmos
we
for
that
reason
keep
a
festival
imitating
the
cosmos
for
how
could
we
attain
higher
order
and
at
first
we
ourselves
having
fallen
from
heaven
and
living
with
the
nymph
are
in
despondency
and
abstain
from
corn
and
all
rich
and
unclean
food
for
both
are
hostile
to
the
soul
then
comes
the
cutting
of
the
tree
and
the
fast
as
though
we
also
were
cutting
off
the
further
process
of
generation
after
that
the
feeding
on
milk
as
though
we
were
being
born
again
after
which
come
rejoicings
and
garlands
and
as
it
were
a
return
up
to
the
gods
the
season
of
the
ritual
is
evidence
to
the
truth
of
these
explanations
the
rites
are
performed
about
the
vernal
equinox
when
the
fruits
of
the
earth
are
ceasing
to
be
produced
and
day
is
becoming
longer
than
night
which
applies
well
to
spirits
rising
higher
at
least
the
other
equinox
is
in
mythology
the
time
of
the
rape
of
korÃª
which
is
the
descent
of
the
souls
may
these
explanations
of
the
myths
find
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
gods
themselves
and
the
souls
of
those
who
wrote
the
myths
the
first
next
in
order
comes
knowledge
of
the
first
cause
and
the
subsequent
orders
of
the
gods
then
the
nature
of
the
world
the
essence
of
intellect
and
of
soul
then
providence
fate
and
fortune
then
to
see
virtue
and
vice
and
the
various
forms
of
social
constitution
good
and
bad
that
are
formed
from
them
and
from
what
possible
source
evil
came
into
the
world
each
of
these
subjects
needs
many
long
discussions
but
there
is
perhaps
no
harm
in
stating
them
briefly
so
that
a
disciple
may
not
be
completely
ignorant
about
them
it
is
proper
to
the
first
cause
to
be
one
for
unity
precedes
multitude
and
to
surpass
all
things
in
power
and
goodness
consequently
all
things
must
partake
of
it
for
owing
to
its
power
nothing
else
can
hinder
it
and
owing
to
its
goodness
it
will
not
hold
itself
apart
if
the
first
cause
were
soul
all
things
would
possess
soul
if
it
were
mind
all
things
would
possess
mind
if
it
were
being
all
things
would
partake
of
being
and
seeing
this
quality
being
in
all
things
some
men
have
thought
that
it
was
being
now
if
things
simply
without
being
good
this
argument
would
be
true
but
if
things
that
are
because
of
their
goodness
and
partake
in
the
good
the
first
thing
must
needs
be
both
and
good
it
is
strong
evidence
of
this
that
noble
souls
despise
being
for
the
sake
of
the
good
when
they
face
death
for
their
country
or
friends
or
for
the
sake
of
after
this
inexpressible
power
come
the
orders
of
the
gods
vi
gods
cosmic
and
of
the
gods
some
are
of
the
world
cosmic
and
some
above
the
world
hypercosmic
by
the
cosmic
i
mean
those
who
make
the
cosmos
of
the
hypercosmic
gods
some
create
essence
some
mind
and
some
soul
thus
they
have
three
orders
all
of
which
may
be
found
in
treatises
on
the
subject
of
the
cosmic
gods
some
make
the
world
others
animate
it
others
harmonize
it
consisting
as
it
does
of
different
elements
the
fourth
class
keep
it
when
harmonized
these
are
four
actions
each
of
which
has
a
beginning
middle
and
end
consequently
there
must
be
twelve
gods
governing
the
world
those
who
make
the
world
are
zeus
poseidon
and
hephaistos
those
who
animate
it
are
demeter
hera
and
artemis
those
who
harmonize
it
are
apollo
aphrodite
and
hermes
those
who
watch
over
it
are
hestia
athena
and
ares
one
can
see
secret
suggestions
of
this
in
their
images
apollo
tunes
a
lyre
athena
is
armed
aphrodite
is
naked
because
harmony
creates
beauty
and
beauty
in
things
seen
is
not
covered
while
these
twelve
in
the
primary
sense
possess
the
world
we
should
consider
that
the
other
gods
are
contained
in
these
dionysus
in
zeus
for
instance
asklepios
in
apollo
the
charites
in
aphrodite
we
can
also
discern
their
various
spheres
to
hestia
belongs
the
earth
to
poseidon
water
to
hera
air
to
hephaistos
fire
and
the
six
superior
spheres
to
the
gods
to
whom
they
are
usually
attributed
for
apollo
and
artemis
are
to
be
taken
for
the
sun
and
moon
the
sphere
of
kronos
should
be
attributed
to
demeter
the
ether
to
athena
while
the
heaven
is
common
to
all
thus
the
orders
powers
and
spheres
of
the
twelve
gods
have
been
explained
and
celebrated
in
hymns
vii
the
nature
of
the
world
and
its
the
cosmos
itself
must
of
necessity
be
indestructible
and
uncreated
indestructible
because
suppose
it
destroyed
the
only
possibility
is
to
make
one
better
than
this
or
worse
or
the
same
or
a
chaos
if
worse
the
power
which
out
of
the
better
makes
the
worse
must
be
bad
if
better
the
maker
who
did
not
make
the
better
at
first
must
be
imperfect
in
power
if
the
same
there
will
be
no
use
in
making
it
if
a
chaos
it
is
impious
even
to
hear
such
a
thing
suggested
these
reasons
would
suffice
to
show
that
the
world
is
also
uncreated
for
if
not
destroyed
neither
is
it
created
everything
that
is
created
is
subject
to
destruction
and
further
since
the
cosmos
exists
by
the
goodness
of
god
it
follows
that
god
must
always
be
good
and
the
world
exist
just
as
light
coexists
with
the
sun
and
with
fire
and
shadow
coexists
with
a
body
of
the
bodies
in
the
cosmos
some
imitate
mind
and
move
in
orbits
some
imitate
soul
and
move
in
a
straight
line
fire
and
air
upward
earth
and
water
downward
of
those
that
move
in
orbits
the
fixed
sphere
goes
from
the
east
the
seven
from
the
west
this
is
so
for
various
causes
especially
lest
the
creation
should
be
imperfect
owing
to
the
rapid
circuit
of
the
spheres
the
movement
being
different
the
nature
of
the
bodies
must
also
be
different
hence
the
celestial
body
does
not
burn
or
freeze
what
it
touches
or
do
anything
else
that
pertains
to
the
four
elements
and
since
the
cosmos
is
a
sphere
the
zodiac
proves
that
and
in
every
sphere
means
the
centre
for
the
centre
is
farthest
distant
from
every
point
and
heavy
things
fall
and
fall
to
the
earth
it
follows
that
the
earth
is
in
the
centre
of
the
cosmos
all
these
things
are
made
by
the
gods
ordered
by
mind
moved
by
soul
about
the
gods
we
have
spoken
already
viii
mind
and
soul
and
that
the
latter
is
there
is
a
certain
force
less
primary
than
being
but
more
primary
than
the
soul
which
draws
its
existence
from
being
and
completes
the
soul
as
the
sun
completes
the
eyes
of
souls
some
are
rational
and
immortal
some
irrational
and
mortal
the
former
are
derived
from
the
first
gods
the
latter
from
the
secondary
first
we
must
consider
what
soul
is
it
is
then
that
by
which
the
animate
differs
from
the
inanimate
the
difference
lies
in
motion
sensation
imagination
intelligence
soul
therefore
when
irrational
is
the
life
of
sense
and
imagination
when
rational
it
is
the
life
which
controls
sense
and
imagination
and
uses
reason
the
irrational
soul
depends
on
the
affections
of
the
body
it
feels
desire
and
anger
irrationally
the
rational
soul
both
with
the
help
of
reason
despises
the
body
and
fighting
against
the
irrational
soul
produces
either
virtue
or
vice
according
as
it
is
victorious
or
defeated
it
must
be
immortal
both
because
it
knows
the
gods
and
nothing
mortal
knows
what
is
immortal
it
looks
down
upon
human
affairs
as
though
it
stood
outside
them
and
like
an
unbodied
thing
it
is
affected
in
the
opposite
way
to
the
body
for
while
the
body
is
young
and
fine
the
soul
blunders
but
as
the
body
grows
old
it
attains
its
highest
power
again
every
good
soul
uses
mind
but
no
body
can
produce
mind
for
how
should
that
which
is
without
mind
produce
mind
again
while
soul
uses
the
body
as
an
instrument
it
is
not
in
it
just
as
the
engineer
is
not
in
his
engines
although
many
engines
move
without
being
touched
by
any
one
and
if
the
soul
is
often
made
to
err
by
the
body
that
is
not
surprising
for
the
arts
can
not
perform
their
work
when
their
instruments
are
spoilt
ix
providence
fate
and
this
is
enough
to
show
the
providence
of
the
gods
for
whence
comes
the
ordering
of
the
world
if
there
is
no
ordering
power
and
whence
comes
the
fact
that
all
things
are
for
a
purpose
irrational
soul
that
there
may
be
sensation
and
rational
that
the
earth
may
be
set
in
order
but
one
can
deduce
the
same
result
from
the
evidences
of
providence
in
nature
the
eyes
have
been
made
transparent
with
a
view
to
seeing
the
nostrils
are
above
the
mouth
to
distinguish
foods
the
front
teeth
are
sharp
to
cut
food
the
back
teeth
broad
to
grind
it
and
we
find
every
part
of
every
object
arranged
on
a
similar
principle
it
is
impossible
that
there
should
be
so
much
providence
in
the
last
details
and
none
in
the
first
principles
then
the
arts
of
prophecy
and
of
healing
which
are
part
of
the
cosmos
come
of
the
good
providence
of
the
gods
all
this
care
for
the
world
we
must
believe
is
taken
by
the
gods
without
any
act
of
will
or
labour
as
bodies
which
possess
some
power
produce
their
effects
by
merely
existing
the
sun
gives
light
and
heat
by
merely
existing
so
and
far
more
so
the
providence
of
the
gods
acts
without
effort
to
itself
and
for
the
good
of
the
objects
of
its
forethought
this
solves
the
problems
of
the
epicureans
who
argue
that
what
is
divine
neither
has
trouble
itself
nor
gives
trouble
to
others
the
incorporeal
providence
of
the
gods
both
for
bodies
and
for
souls
is
of
this
sort
but
that
which
is
of
bodies
and
in
bodies
is
different
from
this
and
is
called
fate
heimarmenÃª
because
the
chain
of
causes
heirmos
is
more
visible
in
the
case
of
bodies
and
it
is
for
dealing
with
this
fate
that
the
science
of
has
been
discovered
therefore
to
believe
that
human
things
especially
their
material
constitution
are
ordered
not
only
by
celestial
beings
but
by
the
celestial
bodies
is
a
reasonable
and
true
belief
reason
shows
that
health
and
sickness
good
fortune
and
bad
fortune
arise
according
to
our
deserts
from
that
source
but
to
attribute
men
acts
of
injustice
and
lust
to
fate
is
to
make
ourselves
good
and
the
gods
bad
unless
by
chance
a
man
meant
by
such
a
statement
that
in
general
all
things
are
for
the
good
of
the
world
and
for
those
who
are
in
a
natural
state
but
that
bad
education
or
weakness
of
nature
changes
the
goods
of
fate
for
the
worse
just
as
it
happens
that
the
sun
which
is
good
for
all
may
be
injurious
to
persons
with
ophthalmia
or
fever
else
why
do
the
massagetae
eat
their
fathers
the
hebrews
practise
circumcision
and
the
persians
preserve
rules
of
rank
why
do
astrologers
while
calling
saturn
and
mars
proceed
to
make
them
good
attributing
to
them
philosophy
and
royalty
generalships
and
treasures
and
if
they
are
going
to
talk
of
triangles
and
squares
it
is
absurd
that
gods
should
change
their
natures
according
to
their
position
in
space
while
human
virtue
remains
the
same
everywhere
also
the
fact
that
the
stars
predict
high
or
low
rank
for
the
father
of
the
person
whose
horoscope
is
taken
teaches
that
they
do
not
always
make
things
happen
but
sometimes
only
indicate
things
for
how
could
things
which
preceded
the
birth
depend
upon
the
birth
further
as
there
is
providence
and
fate
concerned
with
nations
and
cities
and
also
concerned
with
each
individual
so
there
is
also
fortune
which
should
next
be
treated
that
power
of
the
gods
which
orders
for
the
good
things
which
are
not
uniform
and
which
happen
contrary
to
expectation
is
commonly
called
fortune
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
goddess
is
especially
worshipped
in
public
by
cities
for
every
city
consists
of
elements
which
are
not
uniform
fortune
has
power
beneath
the
moon
since
above
the
moon
no
single
thing
can
happen
by
fortune
if
fortune
makes
a
wicked
man
prosperous
and
a
good
man
poor
there
is
no
need
to
wonder
for
the
wicked
regard
wealth
as
everything
the
good
as
nothing
and
the
good
fortune
of
the
bad
can
not
take
away
their
badness
while
virtue
alone
will
be
enough
for
the
good
x
virtue
and
the
doctrine
of
virtue
and
vice
depends
on
that
of
the
soul
when
the
irrational
soul
enters
into
the
body
and
immediately
produces
fight
and
desire
the
rational
soul
put
in
authority
over
all
these
makes
the
soul
tripartite
composed
of
reason
fight
and
desire
virtue
in
the
region
of
reason
is
wisdom
in
the
region
of
fight
is
courage
in
the
region
of
desire
it
is
temperance
the
virtue
of
the
whole
soul
is
righteousness
it
is
for
reason
to
judge
what
is
right
for
fight
in
obedience
to
reason
to
despise
things
that
appear
terrible
for
desire
to
pursue
not
the
apparently
desirable
but
that
which
is
with
reason
desirable
when
these
things
are
so
we
have
a
righteous
life
for
righteousness
in
matters
of
property
is
but
a
small
part
of
virtue
and
thus
we
shall
find
all
four
virtues
in
properly
trained
men
but
among
the
untrained
one
may
be
brave
and
unjust
another
temperate
and
stupid
another
prudent
and
unprincipled
indeed
these
qualities
should
not
be
called
virtues
when
they
are
devoid
of
reason
and
imperfect
and
found
in
irrational
beings
vice
should
be
regarded
as
consisting
of
the
opposite
elements
in
reason
it
is
folly
in
fight
cowardice
in
desire
intemperance
in
the
whole
soul
unrighteousness
the
virtues
are
produced
by
the
right
social
organization
and
by
good
rearing
and
education
the
vices
by
the
opposite
xi
right
and
wrong
social
constitutions
also
depend
on
the
tripartite
nature
of
the
soul
the
rulers
are
analogous
to
reason
the
soldiers
to
fight
the
common
folk
to
desires
where
all
things
are
done
according
to
reason
and
the
best
man
in
the
nation
rules
it
is
a
kingdom
where
more
than
one
rule
according
to
reason
and
fight
it
is
an
aristocracy
where
the
government
is
according
to
desire
and
offices
depend
on
money
that
constitution
is
called
a
timocracy
the
contraries
are
to
kingdom
tyranny
for
kingdom
does
all
things
with
the
guidance
of
reason
and
tyranny
nothing
to
aristocracy
oligarchy
when
not
the

people
but
a
few
of

worst
are

when

xii
origin
of
evil
things
and
that
there
is
no
positive
the
gods
being
good
and
making
all
things
how
do
evils
exist
in
the
world
or
perhaps
it
is
better
first
to
state
the
fact
that
the
gods
being
good
and
making
all
things
there
is
no
positive
evil
it
only
comes
by
absence
of
good
just
as
darkness
itself
does
not
exist
but
only
comes
about
by
absence
of
light
if
evil
exists
it
must
exist
either
in
gods
or
minds
or
souls
or
bodies
it
does
not
exist
in
any
god
for
all
god
is
good
if
any
one
speaks
of
a
mind
he
means
a
mind
without
mind
if
of
a
bad
soul
he
will
make
soul
inferior
to
body
for
no
body
in
itself
is
evil
if
he
says
that
evil
is
made
up
of
soul
and
body
together
it
is
absurd
that
separately
they
should
not
be
evil
but
joined
should
create
evil
suppose
it
is
said
that
there
are
evil
spirits
if
they
have
their
power
from
the
gods
they
can
not
be
evil
if
from
elsewhere
the
gods
do
not
make
all
things
if
they
do
not
make
all
things
then
either
they
wish
to
and
can
not
or
they
can
and
do
not
wish
neither
of
which
is
consistent
with
the
idea
of
god
we
may
see
therefore
from
these
arguments
that
there
is
no
positive
evil
in
the
world
it
is
in
the
activities
of
men
that
the
evils
appear
and
that
not
of
all
men
nor
always
and
as
to
these
if
men
sinned
for
the
sake
of
evil
nature
itself
would
be
evil
but
if
the
adulterer
thinks
his
adultery
bad
but
his
pleasure
good
and
the
murderer
thinks
the
murder
bad
but
the
money
he
gets
by
it
good
and
the
man
who
does
evil
to
an
enemy
thinks
that
to
do
evil
is
bad
but
to
punish
his
enemy
good
and
if
the
soul
commits
all
its
sins
in
that
way
then
the
evils
are
done
for
the
sake
of
goodness
in
the
same
way
because
in
a
given
place
light
does
not
exist
there
comes
darkness
which
has
no
positive
existence
the
soul
sins
therefore
because
while
aiming
at
good
it
makes
mistakes
about
the
good
because
it
is
not
primary
essence
and
we
see
many
things
done
by
the
gods
to
prevent
it
from
making
mistakes
and
to
heal
it
when
it
has
made
them
arts
and
sciences
curses
and
prayers
sacrifices
and
initiations
laws
and
constitutions
judgements
and
punishments
all
came
into
existence
for
the
sake
of
preventing
souls
from
sinning
and
when
they
are
gone
forth
from
the
body
gods
and
spirits
of
purification
cleanse
them
of
their
sins

of
philosophy
but
yet
have
not
souls
beyond
help
it
remains
to
explain
how
these
objects
were
never
made
and
are
never
separated
one
from
another
since
we
ourselves
have
said
above
that
the
secondary
substances
were
by
the
first
everything
made
is
made
either
by
art
or
by
a
physical
process
or
according
to
some
power
now
in
art
or
nature
the
maker
must
needs
be
prior
to
the
made
but
the
maker
according
to
power
constitutes
the
made
absolutely
together
with
itself
since
its
power
is
inseparable
from
it
as
the
sun
makes
light
fire
makes
heat
snow
makes
cold
now
if
the
gods
make
the
world
by
art
they
do
not
make
it
they
make
it
such
as
it
for
all
art
makes
the
form
of
the
object
what
therefore
makes
it
to
be
if
by
a
physical
process
how
in
that
case
can
the
maker
help
giving
part
of
himself
to
the
made
as
the
gods
are
incorporeal
the
world
ought
to
be
incorporeal
too
if
it
were
argued
that
the
gods
were
bodies
then
where
would
the
power
of
incorporeal
things
come
from
and
if
we
were
to
admit
it
it
would
follow
that
when
the
world
decays
its
maker
must
be
decaying
too
if
he
is
a
maker
by
physical
process
if
the
gods
make
the
world
neither
by
art
nor
by
physical
process
it
only
remains
that
they
make
it
by
power
everything
so
made
subsists
together
with
that
which
possesses
the
power
neither
can
things
so
made
be
destroyed
except
the
power
of
the
maker
be
taken
away
so
that
those
who
believe
in
the
destruction
of
the
world
either
deny
the
existence
of
the
gods
or
while
admitting
it
deny
god
power
therefore
he
who
makes
all
things
by
his
own
power
makes
all
things
subsist
together
with
himself
and
since
his
power
is
the
greatest
power
he
must
needs
be
the
maker
not
only
of
men
and
animals
but
of
gods
men
and
spirits
and
the
further
removed
the
first
god
is
from
our
nature
the
more
powers
there
must
be
between
us
and
him
for
all
things
that
are
very
far
apart
have
many
intermediate
points
between
them
xiv
what
sense
though
the
gods
never
change
they
are
said
to
be
made
angry
and
if
any
one
thinks
the
doctrine
of
the
unchangeableness
of
the
gods
is
reasonable
and
true
and
then
wonders
how
it
is
that
they
rejoice
in
the
good
and
reject
the
bad
are
angry
with
sinners
and
become
propitious
when
appeased
the
answer
is
as
follows
god
does
not
rejoice
for
that
which
rejoices
also
grieves
nor
is
he
angered
for
to
be
angered
is
a
passion
nor
is
he
appeased
by
gifts
if
he
were
he
would
be
conquered
by
pleasure
it
is
impious
to
suppose
that
the
divine
is
affected
for
good
or
ill
by
human
things
the
gods
are
always
good
and
always
do
good
and
never
harm
being
always
in
the
same
state
and
like
themselves
the
truth
simply
is
that
when
we
are
good
we
are
joined
to
the
gods
by
our
likeness
to
them
when
bad
we
are
separated
from
them
by
our
unlikeness
and
when
we
live
according
to
virtue
we
cling
to
the
gods
and
when
we
become
evil
we
make
the
gods
our
enemies
not
because
they
are
angered
against
us
but
because
our
sins
prevent
the
light
of
the
gods
from
shining
upon
us
and
put
us
in
communion
with
spirits
of
punishment
and
if
by
prayers
and
sacrifices
we
find
forgiveness
of
sins
we
do
not
appease
or
change
the
gods
but
by
what
we
do
and
by
our
turning
towards
the
divine
we
heal
our
own
badness
and
so
enjoy
again
the
goodness
of
the
gods
to
say
that
god
turns
away
from
the
evil
is
like
saying
that
the
sun
hides
himself
from
the
blind
xv
we
give
worship
to
the
gods
when
they
need
this
solves
the
question
about
sacrifices
and
other
rites
performed
to
the
gods
the
divine
itself
is
without
needs
and
the
worship
is
paid
for
our
own
benefit
the
providence
of
the
gods
reaches
everywhere
and
needs
only
some
congruity
for
its
reception
all
congruity
comes
about
by
representation
and
likeness
for
which
reason
the
temples
are
made
in
representation
of
heaven
the
altar
of
earth
the
images
of
life
that
is
why
they
are
made
like
living
things
the
prayers
of
the
element
of
thought
the
mystic
letters
of
the
unspeakable
celestial
forces
the
herbs
and
stones
of
matter
and
the
sacrificial
animals
of
the
irrational
life
in
us
from
all
these
things
the
gods
gain
nothing
what
gain
could
there
be
to
god
it
is
we
who
gain
some
communion
with
them
xvi
sacrifices
and
other
worships
that
we
benefit
man
by
them
but
not
the
i
think
it
well
to
add
some
remarks
about
sacrifices
in
the
first
place
since
we
have
received
everything
from
the
gods
and
it
is
right
to
pay
the
giver
some
tithe
of
his
gifts
we
pay
such
a
tithe
of
possessions
in
votive
offerings
of
bodies
in
gifts
of
hair
and
adornment
and
of
life
in
sacrifices
then
secondly
prayers
without
sacrifices
are
only
words
with
sacrifices
they
are
live
words
the
word
gives
meaning
to
the
life
while
the
life
animates
the
word
thirdly
the
happiness
of
every
object
is
its
own
perfection
and
perfection
for
each
is
communion
with
its
own
cause
for
this
reason
we
pray
for
communion
with
the
gods
since
therefore
the
first
life
is
the
life
of
the
gods
but
human
life
is
also
life
of
a
kind
and
human
life
wishes
for
communion
with
divine
life
a
mean
term
is
needed
for
things
very
far
apart
can
not
have
communion
without
a
mean
term
and
the
mean
term
must
be
like
the
things
joined
therefore
the
mean
term
between
life
and
life
must
be
life
that
is
why
men
sacrifice
animals
only
the
rich
do
so
now
but
in
old
days
everybody
did
and
that
not
indiscriminately
but
giving
the
suitable
offerings
to
each
god
together
with
a
great
deal
of
other
worship
enough
of
this
subject
xvii
the
world
is
by
nature
we
have
shown
above
that
the
gods
will
not
destroy
the
world
it
remains
to
show
that
its
nature
is
indestructible
everything
that
is
destroyed
is
either
destroyed
by
itself
or
by
something
else
if
the
world
is
destroyed
by
itself
fire
must
needs
burn
itself
and
water
dry
itself
if
by
something
else
it
must
be
either
by
a
body
or
by
something
incorporeal
by
something
incorporeal
is
impossible
for
incorporeal
things
preserve
bodies
nature
for
instance
and
soul
and
nothing
is
destroyed
by
a
cause
whose
nature
is
to
preserve
it
if
it
is
destroyed
by
some
body
it
must
be
either
by
those
which
exist
or
by
others
if
by
those
which
exist
then
either
those
moving
in
a
straight
line
must
be
destroyed
by
those
that
revolve
or
vice
versa
but
those
that
revolve
have
no
destructive
nature
else
why
do
we
never
see
anything
destroyed
from
that
cause
nor
yet
can
those
which
are
moving
straight
touch
the
others
else
why
have
they
never
been
able
to
do
so
yet
but
neither
can
those
moving
straight
be
destroyed
by
one
another
for
the
destruction
of
one
is
the
creation
of
another
and
that
is
not
to
be
destroyed
but
to
change
but
if
the
world
is
to
be
destroyed
by
other
bodies
than
these
it
is
impossible
to
say
where
such
bodies
are
or
whence
they
are
to
arise
again
everything
destroyed
is
destroyed
either
in
form
or
matter
form
is
the
shape
of
a
thing
matter
the
body
now
if
the
form
is
destroyed
and
the
matter
remains
we
see
other
things
come
into
being
if
matter
is
destroyed
how
is
it
that
the
supply
has
not
failed
in
all
these
years
if
when
matter
is
destroyed
other
matter
takes
its
place
the
new
matter
must
come
either
from
something
that
is
or
from
something
that
is
not
if
from
as
long
as
always
remains
matter
always
remains
but
if
is
destroyed
such
a
theory
means
that
not
the
world
only
but
everything
in
the
universe
is
destroyed
if
again
matter
comes
from
in
the
first
place
it
is
impossible
for
anything
to
come
from
that
which
is
not
but
suppose
it
to
happen
and
that
matter
did
arise
from
that
which
is
not
then
as
long
as
there
are
things
which
are
not
matter
will
exist
for
i
presume
there
can
never
be
an
end
of
things
which
are
not
if
they
say
that
matter
will
become
formless
in
the
first
place
why
does
this
happen
to
the
world
as
a
whole
when
it
does
not
happen
to
any
part
secondly
by
this
hypothesis
they
do
not
destroy
the
being
of
bodies
but
only
their
beauty
further
everything
destroyed
is
either
resolved
into
the
elements
from
which
it
came
or
else
vanishes
into
if
things
are
resolved
into
the
elements
from
which
they
came
then
there
will
be
others
else
how
did
they
come
into
being
at
all
if
is
to
depart
into
what
prevents
that
happening
to
god
himself
which
is
absurd
or
if
god
power
prevents
that
it
is
not
a
mark
of
power
to
be
able
to
save
nothing
but
oneself
and
it
is
equally
impossible
for
to
come
out
of
nothing
and
to
depart
into
nothing
again
if
the
world
is
destroyed
it
must
needs
either
be
destroyed
according
to
nature
or
against
nature
against
nature
is
impossible
for
that
which
is
against
nature
is
not
stronger
than
nature
if
according
to
nature
there
must
be
another
nature
which
changes
the
nature
of
the
world
which
does
not
appear
again
anything
that
is
naturally
destructible
we
can
ourselves
destroy
but
no
one
has
ever
destroyed
or
altered
the
round
body
of
the
world
and
the
elements
though
they
can
be
changed
can
not
be
destroyed
again
everything
destructible
is
changed
by
time
and
grows
old
but
the
world
through
all
these
years
has
remained
utterly
unchanged
having
said
so
much
for
the
help
of
those
who
feel
the
need
of
very
strong
demonstrations
i
pray
the
world
himself
to
be
gracious
to
me
xviii
there
are
rejections
of
god
and
that
god
is
not
nor
need
the
fact
that
rejections
of
god
have
taken
place
in
certain
parts
of
the
earth
and
will
often
take
place
hereafter
disturb
the
mind
of
the
wise
both
because
these
things
do
not
affect
the
gods
just
as
we
saw
that
worship
did
not
benefit
them
and
because
the
soul
being
of
middle
essence
can
not
be
always
right
and
because
the
whole
world
can
not
enjoy
the
providence
of
the
gods
equally
but
some
parts
may
partake
of
it
eternally
some
at
certain
times
some
in
the
primal
manner
some
in
the
secondary
just
as
the
head
enjoys
all
the
senses
but
the
rest
of
the
body
only
one
for
this
reason
it
seems
those
who
ordained
festivals
ordained
also
forbidden
days
in
which
some
temples
lay
idle
some
were
shut
some
had
their
adornment
removed
in
expiation
of
the
weakness
of
our
nature
it
is
not
unlikely
too
that
the
rejection
of
god
is
a
kind
of
punishment
we
may
well
believe
that
those
who
knew
the
gods
and
neglected
them
in
one
life
may
in
another
life
be
deprived
of
the
knowledge
of
them
altogether
also
those
who
have
worshipped
their
own
kings
as
gods
have
deserved
as
their
punishment
to
lose
all
knowledge
of
god
xix
sinners
are
not
punished
at
there
is
no
need
to
be
surprised
if
neither
these
sins
nor
yet
others
bring
immediate
punishment
upon
sinners
for
it
is
not
only
spirits
who
punish
the
soul
the
soul
brings
itself
to
judgement
and
also
it
is
not
right
for
those
who
endure
for
ever
to
attain
everything
in
a
short
time
and
also
there
is
need
of
human
virtue
if
punishment
followed
instantly
upon
sin
men
would
act
justly
from
fear
and
have
no
virtue
souls
are
punished
when
they
have
gone
forth
from
the
body
some
wandering
among
us
some
going
to
hot
or
cold
places
of
the
earth
some
harassed
by
spirits
under
all
circumstances
they
suffer
with
the
irrational
part
of
their
nature
with
which
they
also
sinned
for
its
sake
there
subsist
that
shadowy
body
which
is
seen
about
graves
especially
the
graves
of
evil
livers
xx
transmigration
of
souls
and
how
souls
are
said
to
migrate
into
brute
if
the
transmigration
of
a
soul
takes
place
into
a
rational
being
it
simply
becomes
the
soul
of
that
body
but
if
the
soul
migrates
into
a
brute
beast
it
follows
the
body
outside
as
a
guardian
spirit
follows
a
man
for
there
could
never
be
a
rational
soul
in
an
irrational
being
the
transmigration
of
souls
can
be
proved
from
the
congenital
afflictions
of
persons
for
why
are
some
born
blind
others
paralytic
others
with
some
sickness
in
the
soul
itself
again
it
is
the
natural
duty
of
souls
to
do
their
work
in
the
body
are
we
to
suppose
that
when
once
they
leave
the
body
they
spend
all
eternity
in
idleness
again
if
the
souls
did
not
again
enter
into
bodies
they
must
either
be
infinite
in
number
or
god
must
constantly
be
making
new
ones
but
there
is
nothing
infinite
in
the
world
for
in
a
finite
whole
there
can
not
be
an
infinite
part
neither
can
others
be
made
for
everything
in
which
something
new
goes
on
being
created
must
be
imperfect
and
the
world
being
made
by
a
perfect
author
ought
naturally
to
be
perfect
xxi
the
good
are
happy
both
living
and
souls
that
have
lived
in
virtue
are
in
general
happy
and
when
separated
from
the
irrational
part
of
their
nature
and
made
clean
from
all
matter
have
communion
with
the
gods
and
join
them
in
the
governing
of
the
whole
world
yet
even
if
none
of
this
happiness
fell
to
their
lot
virtue
itself
and
the
joy
and
glory
of
virtue
and
the
life
that
is
subject
to
no
grief
and
no
master
are
enough
to
make
happy
those
who
have
set
themselves
to

according
to
virtue

have
achieved
