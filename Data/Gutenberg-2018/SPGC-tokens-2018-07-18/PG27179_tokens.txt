kochanowski
was
a
learned
poet
of
the
renaissance
drawing
his
inspiration
from
the
literatures
of
greece
and
rome
he
was
also
a
man
of
sincere
piety
famous
for
his
translation
of
the

into
his
native
language
in
his
written
in

of
his
little
daughter
ursula
who
died
in
at
the
age
of
thirty
months
he
expresses
the
deepest
personal
emotion
through
the
medium
of
a
literary
style
that
had
been
developed
by
long
years

study

be
sure

not
based
on
any
classic
model
and
they
contain
few
direct
imitations
of
the
classical
poets

it
may
be
noted
that
the
concluding
couplet
of
is
translated
from
the
on
the
other
hand
they
are
interspersed
with
continual
references
to
classic
story
and
more
important
are
filled
with
the
atmosphere
of
the
stoic
philosophy
derived
from
cicero
and
seneca
and
along
with
this
austere
teaching
there
runs
through
them
a
warmer
tone
of
christian
hope
and
trust

a
psalm
to
us
of
today
however
these
poems
appeal
less
by
their
formal
perfection
by
their
learning
or
by
their
religious
tone
than
by
their
exquisite
humanity

if
i

ever
thought
to
write
in
praise

little

their

rather

such
trifling

sad
misfortune
this
day
asks
to
weep
thy
deaf
grave
dear
maiden
mine

wail
the
harshness
of
grim

now
i
have
no
choice
of
subject

i
shunned
a
theme
scarce
fitting

now
disaster
drives
me
on
by

to
songs
unheeded
by
the
great
concourse
of

thou

hardly
knewest
that
the
sun
was

thou
didst
vanish
to
the
halls
of
night
i
would
thou
hadst
not
lived
that
little
breath
what
didst
thou
know
but
only
birth
then
death
and
all
the
joy
a
loving
child
should
bring
her
parents
is
become
their
bitterest
sting
lament
iii
so
thou
hast
scorned
me
my
delight
and
heir
thy
father
halls
then
were
not
broad
and
fair
enough
for
thee
to
dwell
here
longer
sweet
true
there
was
nothing
nothing
in
them
meet
for
thy
reason
that
foretold
virtues
the
future
years
would
yet
unfold
thy
words
thy
archness
every
turn
and
bow
how
sick
at
heart
without
them
am
i
now
nay
little
comfort
never
more
shall
i
behold
thee
and
thy
darling
drollery
what
may
i
do
but
only
follow
on
along
the
path
where
earlier
thou
hast
gone
and
at
its
end
do
thou
with
all
thy
charms
cast
round
thy
father
neck
thy
tender
arms
lament
iv
thou
hast
constrained
mine
eyes
unholy
death
to
watch
my
dear
child
breathe
her
dying
breath
to
watch
thee
shake
the
fruit
unripe
and
clinging
while
fear
and
grief
her
parents
hearts
were
wringing
ah
never
never
could
my
child
have
died
and
left
her
father
reconciled
never
but
with
a
heart
like
heavy
lead
could
i
have
watched
her
go
abandoned
and
yet
at
no
time
could
her
death
have
brought
more
cruel
ache
than
now
nor
bitterer
thought
for
had
god
granted
to
her
ample
days
i
might
have
walked
with
her
down
flowered
ways
and
left
this
life
at
last
content
descending
to
realms
of
dark
persephone
the
without
such
grievous
sorrow
in
my
heart
of
which
earth
holdeth
not
the
counterpart
i
marvel
not
that
niobe
alone
amid
her
dear
dead
children
turned
to
stone
lament
v
just
as
a
little
olive
offshoot
grows
beneath
its
orchard
elders
shady
rows
no
budding
leaf
as
yet
no
branching
limb
only
a
rod
uprising
then
if
the
busy
gardener
weeding
out
sharp
thorns
and
nettles
cuts
the
little
sprout
it
fades
and
losing
all
its
living
hue
drops
by
the
mother
from
whose
roots
it
grew
so
was
it
with
my
ursula
my
dear
a
little
space
she
grew
beside
us
here
then
death
came
breathing
pestilence
and
she
fell
stricken
lifeless
by
her
parent
tree
persephone
persephone
this
flow
of
barren
tears
how
couldst
thou
will
it
so
lament
vi
dear
little
slavic
sappho
we
had
thought
hearing
thy
songs
so
sweetly
deftly
wrought
that
thou
shouldst
have
an
heritage
one
day
beyond
thy
father
lands
his
lute
to
play
for
not
an
hour
of
daylight
joyous
round
but
thou
didst
fill
it
full
of
lovely
sound
just
as
the
nightingale
doth
scatter
pleasure
upon
the
dark
in
glad
unstinted
measure
then
death
came
stalking
near
thee
timid
thing
and
thou
in
sudden
terror
tookest
wing
ah
that
delight
it
was
not
overlong
and
i
pay
dear
with
sorrow
for
brief
song
thou
still
wert
singing
when
thou
to
die
kissing
thy
mother
thus
thou
saidst
my
mother
i
shall
serve
thee
now
no
more
nor
sit
about
thy
table
charming
store
i
must
lay
down
my
keys
to
go
from
here
to
leave
the
mansion
of
my
parents
dear
this
and
what
sorrow
now
will
let
me
tell
no
longer
were
my
darling
last
farewell
ah
strong
her
mother
heart
to
feel
the
pain
of
those
last
words
and
not
to
burst
in
twain
lament
vii
sad
trinkets
of
my
little
daughter
dresses
that
touched
her
like
caresses
why
do
you
draw
my
mournful
eyes
to
borrow
a
newer
weight
of
sorrow
no
longer
will
you
clothe
her
form
to
fold
her
around
and
wrap
her
hold
her
a
hard
unwaking
sleep
has
overpowered
her
limbs
and
now
the
flowered
cool
muslin
and
the
ribbon
snoods
are
bootless
the
gilded
girdles
fruitless
my
little
girl
was
to
a
bed
far
other
that
one
day
thy
poor
mother
had
thought
to
lead
thee
and
this
simple
dower
suits
not
the
bridal
hour
a
tiny
shroud
and
gown
of
her
own
sewing
she
gives
thee
at
thy
going
thy
rather
brings
a
clod
of
earth
a
somber
pillow
for
thy
last
slumber
and
so
a
single
casket
scant
of
measure
locks
thee
and
all
thy
treasure
lament
viii
thou
hast
made
all
the
house
an
empty
thing
dear
ursula
by
this
thy
vanishing
though
we
are
here
is
yet
a
vacant
place
one
little
soul
had
filled
so
great
a
space
for
thou
didst
sing
thy
joyousness
to
all
running
through
every
nook
of
house
and
hall
thou
wouldst
not
have
thy
mother
grieve
nor
let
thy
father
with
too
solemn
thinking
fret
his
head
but
thou
must
kiss
them
daughter
mine
and
all
with
that
entrancing
laugh
of
thine
now
on
the
house
has
fallen
a
dumb
blight
thou
wilt
not
come
with
archness
and
delight
but
every
corner
lodges
lurking
grief
and
all
in
vain
the
heart
would
seek
relief
lament
ix
thou
shouldst
be
purchased
wisdom
for
much
gold
if
all
they
say
of
thee
is
truly
told
that
thou
canst
root
out
from
the
mind
the
host
of
longings
and
canst
change
a
man
almost
into
an
angel
whom
no
grief
can
sap
who
is
not
prone
to
fear
nor
evil
hap
thou
seest
all
things
human
as
they
are
trifles
thou
bearest
in
thy
breast
a
star
fixed
and
tranquil
and
dost
contemplate
death
unafraid
still
calm
inviolate
of
riches
one
thing
thou
dost
hold
the
measure

to
man
needs
not
gold
nor
treasure
thy
searching
eyes
have
power
to
behold
the
beggar
housed
beneath
the
roof
of
gold
nor
dost
thou
grudge
the
poor
man

as
blest
if
he
but
hearken
him
to
thy
behest
oh
hapless
hapless
man
am

might
gain
thy
thresholds

gloomy
water

thee
onward

daughter

having
drunken
of
forgetfulness
art
thou
unwitting

my
sore
distress

casting
off
thy
human
maiden

thou
enfeathered
in
some
nightingale

in
grim
purgatory

thou
stay

stain
be
washed
away

returned

hold
grief
to
be

death

stifle

when

scants
her

no

didst

why
dost
mourn
thy
daughter
so
when
thou
hast
said
the
only
woe
that
man
need
dread
is
base
dishonor
why
sorrow
on

death
thou
hast
said
can
terrify
the

so

my

far

evil
hap

jealousy
had
no

of
harming

the

who
doth
disdain
flimsy
safeguards
raised

struck
a

more

its

all
such

we

who
giveth

we
heed
not
him
from

delights

us
in

not

cause
thee
dear
god
to

the
glory
of
thy
beauty
chasten
us
till
we
shall
recall
our
duty
yet
punish
us
as
with
a

hand
we
mites
can
not
withstand
thine
anger
we
are

thy
wrath
the
sun
that
melts
us
in

glow
make
us

thus
eternal

from
thy
too
heavy
rod

thy

alone
doth
give
thy
children

pain

i
do
know
thy
mercy
doth
abound
while
yet
the
spheres
turn
round
and
thou
wilt
never
cast

humbles
him

the
dream
long
through
the
night
hours
sorrow
was
my
guest
and
would
not
let
my
fainting
body
rest
till
just
ere
dawn
from
out
its
slow
dominions
flew
sleep
to
wrap
me
in
its
dear
dusk
pinions
and
then
it
was
my
mother
did
appear
before
mine
eyes
in
vision
doubly
dear
for
in
her
arms
she
held
my
darling
one
my
ursula
just
as
she
used
to
run
to
me
at
dawn
to
say
her
morning
prayer
in
her
white
nightgown
with
her
curling
hair
framing
her
rosy
face
her
eyes
about
to
laugh
like
flowers
only
halfway
out
art
thou
still
sorrowing
my
son
thus
spoke
my
mother
sighing
bitterly
i
woke
or
seemed
to
wake
and
heard
her
say
once
more
it
is
thy
weeping
brings
me
to
this
shore
thy
lamentations
long
uncomforted
have
reached
the
hidden
chambers
of
the
dead
till
i
have
come
to
grant
thee
some
small
grace
and
let
thee
gaze
upon
thy
daughter
face
that
it
may
calm
thy
heart
in
some
degree
and
check
the
grief
that
imperceptibly
doth
gnaw
away
thy
health
and
leave
thee
sick
like
fire
that
turns
to
ashes
a
dry
wick
dost
thou
believe
the
dead
have
perished
quite
their
sun
gone
down
in
an
eternal
night
ah
no
we
have
a
being
far
more
splendid
now
that
our
bodies
coarser
claims
are
ended
though
dust
returns
to
dust
the
spirit
given
a
life
eternal
must
go
back
to
heaven
and
little
ursula
hath
not
gone
out
forever
like
a
torch
nay
cease
thy
doubt
for
i
have
brought
her
hither
in
the
guise
she
used
to
wear
before
thy
mortal
eyes
though
mid
the
deathless
angels
brighter
far
she
shineth
as
the
lovely
morning
star
and
still
she
offers
up
her
prayers
for
you
as
here
on
earth
when
yet
no
words
she
knew
if
herefrom
springs
thy
sorrow
that
her
years
were
broken
off
before
all
that
endears
a
life
on
earth
to
mortals
she
might
prove
yet
think
how
empty
the
delights
that
move
the
minds
of
men
delights
that
must
give
place
at
last
to
sorrow
as
in
thine
own
case
did
then
thy
little
girl
such
joy
confer
that
all
the
comfort
thou
didst
find
in
her
could
parallel
thine
anguish
of
today
thou
canst
not
answer
otherwise
than
nay
then
fret
not
that
so
early
death
has
come
to
what
was
dearest
thee
in
christendom
she
did
not
leave
a
land
of
much
delight
but
one
of
toil
and
grief
and
evil
blight
so
plenteous
that
all
which
men
can
hold
of
their
so
transitory
blessings
gold
must
lose
its
value
through
this
base
alloy
this
knowledge
of
the
grief
that
follows
joy
why
do
we
weep
great
god
that
with
her
dower
she
bought
herself
no
lord
that
she
might
cower
before
upbraidings
from
her
husband
kin
that
she
knew
not
the
pangs
that
usher
in
the
newborn
child
and
that
she
could
not
know
like
her
poor
mother
if
more
racking
woe
it
were
to
bear
or
bury
them
ah
meet
are
such
delights
to
make
the
world
more
sweet
but
heaven
hath
purer
surer
happiness
free
from
all
intermingling
of
distress
care
rules
not
here
and
here
we
know
not
toil
misfortune
and
disaster
do
not
spoil
here
sickness
can
not
enter
nor
old
age
and
death
hath
no
pasturage
we
live
a
life
of
endless
joy
that
brings
good
thoughts
we
know
the
causes
of
all
things
the
sun
shines
on
forever
here
its
light
unconquered
by
impenetrable
night
and
the
creator
in
his
majesty
invisible
to
mortals
we
may
see
then
turn
thy
meditations
hither
towards
this
changeless
gladness
and
these
rich
rewards
thou
the
world
what
love
of
it
can
do
found
thou
thine
efforts
on
a
base
more
true
thy
little
girl
hath
chosen
well
her
part
thou
believe
as
one
about
to
start
for
the
first
time
upon
the
stormy
sea
beholding
there
great
flux
and
jeopardy
returneth
to
the
shore
while
those
that
raise
their
sails
the
wind
or
some
blind
crag
betrays
and
this
one
dies
from
hunger
that
from
cold
scarce
one
escapes
the
perils
manifold
so
she
who
though
her
years
should
have
surpassed
that
ancient
sybil
must
have
died
at
last
preferred
that
ending
to
anticipate
before
she
knew
the
ills
of
man
estate
for
some
are
left
without
their
parents
care
to
know
how
sore
an
orphan
lot
to
bear
one
girl
must
marry
headlong
and
then
rue
her
dower
given
up
to
god
knows
who
some
maids
are
seized
by
their
own
countrymen
others
made
captive
by
the
tatar
clan
and
held
thus
in
a
pagan
shameful
thrall
must
drink
their
tears
till
death
comes
ending
all
but
this
thy
little
child
need
fear
no
more
who
taken
early
up
to
heaven
door
could
walk
all
glad
and
within
her
soul
still
innocent
of
earthly
sin
doubt
not
my
son
that
all
is
well
with
her
and
let
not
sorrow
be
thy
conqueror
reason
and
are
precious
still
and
yielding
all
to
blighted
hope
is
be
in
this
matter
thine
own

although
thy
happiness
thou
must
forego
for
man

born
exposed
to
circumstance
to
be
the
target
of
all
evil
chance
and
if
we
like
it
or
we
like

not
we
still
can
not
escape
our
destined
lot
nor
hath
misfortune
singled
thee
my
son
it
lays
its
burdens
upon
every
one
thy
little
child
was
mortal
as
thou
art
she
ran
her
given
course
and
did
depart
and
if
that
course
was
brief
yet
who
can
say
that
she
would
have
been
happier
to
stay
the
ways
of
god
are
past
our
finding
out
yet
what
he
holds
as
good
shall
we
misdoubt
and
when
the
spirit
leaves
us
it
is
vain
to
weep
so
long
it
will
not
come
again
and
herein
man
is
hardly
just
to
fate
to
bear
in
mind
what
is
unfortunate
in
life
and
to
forget
all
that
transpires
in
full
accordance
with
his
own
desires
and
such
is
fortune
power
dearest
son
that
we
should
not
lament
when
she
hath
done
a
bitter
turn
but
thank
her
in
that
she
hath
held
her
hand
from
greater
injury
so
yielding
to
the
common
order
bar
thy
heart
to
more
disasters
than
now
are
gaze
at
the
happiness
thou
dost
retain
what
is
not
loss
that
must
be
rated
gain
and
finally
what
profits
the
expense
of
thy
long
labor
and
the
years
gone
hence
while
thou
didst
spend
thyself
upon
thy
books
and
knewest
scarce
how
lightsome
pleasure
looks
now
from
thy
grafting
pluck
the
fruit
and
save
something
of
value
from
frail
nature
grave
to
other
men
in
sorrow
thou
hast
shown
the
comfort
left
them
hast
none
for
thine
own
now
master
heal
thyself
time
is
the
cure
for
all
but
he
whose
wisdom
doth
abjure
the
common
ways
he
should
anticipate
the
healing
for
which
other
men
must
wait
what
is
time
cunning
that
it
drives
away
our
former
haps
with
newer
ones
more
gay
or
like
the
old
so
man
by
taking
thought
perceives
them
ere
their
accidents
are
wrought
and
by
such
thinking
banishes
the
past
and
views
the
future
quiet
and
steadfast
then
bear
man
portion
like
a
man
my
son
the
lord
of
grief
and
comfort

but
one
then
i
awoke

to
deem
this
