advance
notice
by
the
author
one
afternoon
shortly
before
the
new
york
opening
of
this
comedy
a
most
estimable
lady
sat
down
to
make
me
a
cup
of
tea
now
do
tell
me
what
is
your
play
about
she
inquired
with
commendable
enthusiasm
for
being
a
true
woman
she
had
early
achieved
the
becoming
habit
of
letting
members
of
the
superior
sex
talk
about
themselves
marry
said
i
tells
the
truth
about
marriage
oh
why
she
expostulated
why
write
unpleasant
plays
but
it
is
not
then
it
is
true
she
exclaimed
that
is
i
mean
i
mean
did
you
say
cream
or
lemon
and
in
the
pause
which
accompanied
the
pouring
of
the
cream
i
detected
the
look
of
one
realizing
too
late
that
it
is
always
better
to
think
before
speaking
this
little
incident
it
seemed
to
me
epitomizes
charmingly
the
attitude
of
our
nicest
people
toward
our
fundamental
institution
the
truth
about
marriage
must
be
unpleasant
therefore
tell
us
something
we
know
is
true
it
will
be
so
much
nicer
for
our
young
people
it
is
to
be
feared
however
that
young
people
who
go
to
see
why
marry
in
the
hope
of
being
shocked
do
not
get
their
money
worth
i
have
heard
of
but
two
persons
who
have
been
scandalized
by
this
play
and
they
were
both
old
people
one
was
a
woman
in
the
country
who
had
not
seen
it
but
had
read
the
title
and
so
wrote
several
indignant
letters
about
it
the
other
was
an
elderly
bachelor
of
the
type
which
finds
useful
occupation
in
decorating
club
windows
like
geraniums
he
took
his
niece
to
see
it
and
deciding
at
the
end
of
act
ii
that
the
play
was
going
to
be
unpleasant
in
act
iii
took
her
home
at
once
the
next
afternoon
she
appeared
at
the
matin√©e
with
a
whole
bevy
of
her
own
generation
and
saw
the
rest
of
the
play
i
asked
her
later
if
it
had
shocked
any
of
them
oh
no
she
replied
we
are
too
young
to
be
shocked
that
little
incident
also
struck
me
as
socially
significant
there
never
were
two
generations
inhabiting
the
same
globe
simultaneously
with
such
widely
separated
points
of
view
for
several
years
after
this
play
was
first
published
no
theatrical
manager
on
broadway
would
produce
it
i
do
blame
them
i
want
to
thank
them
for
it
i
doubt
if
this
sort
of
thing
could
have
appealed
to
many
then
especially
as
my
young
lovers
are
trying
to
be
good
not
bad
and
the
right
to
happiness
do
not
enter
into
their
plans
the
causes
of
their
courageous
and
of
course
mistaken
decision
are
unselfish
and
social
motives
however
futile
and
antisocial
the
results
would
have
been
had
not
their
desperate
determination
been
thwarted
when
this
play
was
first
published
most
people
were
not
thinking
along
these
lines
such
ideas
were
considered
radical
then
they
will
soon
be
even
on
the
stage
kind
and
discriminating
as
the
critics
have
been
in
regard
to
this
comedy
a
discriminating
critic
being
of
course
one
who
praises
your
play
few
of
them
have
seen
the
point
which
i
thought
i
was
making
emphatically
clear
namely
that
we
ca
cure
social
defects
by
individual
treatment
not
only
the
lovers
but
all
the
characters
in
this
play
are
trying
to
do
right
according
to
their
lights
there
is
no
villain
in
this
piece
at
least
the
villain
remains
off
stage
perhaps
that
is
why
so
few
see
him
you
are
the
villain
you
and
i
and
the
rest
of
society
we
are
responsible
for
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
marriage
game
instead
of
having
fun
with
human
nature
i
tried
to
go
higher
up
and
have
fun
with
human
institutions
i
say
tried
because
apparently
i
did
not
succeed
the
joke
is
on
me
still
i
can
get
some
amusement
out
of
it
for
a
great
many
people
seem
to
like
this
play
who
would
be
indignant
if
they
knew
what
they
were
really
applauding
they
think
they
are
merely
enjoying
satire
on
human
nature
now
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
you
can
always
curse
human
nature
with
impunity
can
malign
it
revile
it
boot
it
up
and
down
the
decalogue
and
you
will
be
warmly
praised
how
true
to
life
you
are
told
i
know
some
one
just
like
that
it
is
always
some
one
else
of
course
but
dare
lay
hands
on
the
existing
order
and
you
find
you
laid
your
hands
on
a
hornet
nest
you
see
most
people
do
not
want
anything
changed
except
possibly
the
law
of
change
they
do
not
object
to
finding
fault
with
mankind
because
you
ca
change
human
nature
as
they
are
fond
of
telling
you
with
an
interesting
air
of
originality
but
laws
customs
and
ideals
can
be
changed
can
be
improved
therefore
they
cry
hands
off
how
dare
you
man
made
human
institutions
therefore
we
reverence
them
whereas
human
nature
was
merely
made
by
god
so
we
do
think
so
much
of
it
we
are
prejudiced
like
all
creators
in
favor
of
our
own
creations
after
all
there
is
excellent
precedent
for
such
complacency
even
god
we
are
informed
pronounced
his
work
all
very
good
and
rested
on
the
seventh
day
pretty
nearly
everything
in
the
play
as
acted
is
in
the
book
as
published
but
by
no
means
all
that
is
in
the
book
could
possibly
be
enacted
on
the
stage
in
two
hours
and
a
half
one
scene
a
breakfast
scene
between
john
and
his
wife
has
been
amplified
for
acting
but
all
the
other
scenes
as
printed
here
have
been
shortened
for
stage
purposes
and
one
or
two
cut
out
entirely
the
set
was
changed
to
represent
the
loggia
instead
of
the
terrace
of
john
little
farm
outdoor
scenes
are
not
supposed
to
be
good
for
comedy
walls
or
a
suggestion
of
them
produce
a
better
psychological
effect
for
the
purpose
besides
making
it
possible
to
speak
in
quieter
more
intimate
tones
than
when
the
voice
spills
out
into
the
wings
and
up
into
the
paint
loft
near
the
end
of
the
play
a
number
of
relatives
rich
and
poor
are
supposed
to
arrive
for
dinner
and
for
influencing
by
their
presence
the
recalcitrant
couple
that
is
the
way
it
is
printed
and
that
is
how
it
was
acted
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
the
chicago
run
but
though
the
family
may
have
its
place
in
the
book
it
proved
to
be
an
awful
nuisance
on
the
stage
no
matter
how
well
these
minor
parts
might
be
acted
or
dressed
their
sudden
irruption
during
the
last
and
most
important
moments
of
the
performance
distracted
the
audience
attention
from
the
principal
characters
and
the
main
issue
it
was
not
clear
who
was
who
programmes
fluttered
perplexity
was
observed
so
we
decided
that
the
family
must
be
destroyed
it
is
always
a
perplexing
problem
to
devise
a
substitute
for
the
family

sexless
freak
with
a
scientific
degree
jean

trotted
out
the
little
sister
why
not
be
honest
about
it
lucy

do
think
it
nice

sexless
freak
not
with
a
degree
either

tall
strong
glorious
plenty
of
charm
despite
her
ideas
she

i
had
seen

so
long
i
thought
from
helen
to
wait
i
get
the
car
hurries
lucy
why
could
she
have
stayed
abroad
jean
helen
do
talk
about
your
work
before
lucy
it
shocks
her
helen
oh
very
well
make
it
my
jean
around
sssh
that
worse
lucy
helen
dear
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
you
are
being
talked
about
helen
lucy
dear
do
you
always
find
your
true
happiness
in
duty
lucy
well
if
you
think
you
are
going
back
to
that
horrid
place
again
after
what
happened
that
night
john
wo
hear
of
it
helen
if
the
baker
institute
of
medical
experiment
is
not
a
respectable
place
you
should
make
john
resign
as
trustee
laughs
it
lucy
john
is
trustee
of
oh
nearly
everything
that
makes
it
all
the
worse
it
is
as
if
you
had
to
work
helen
oh
but
john
is
so
rich
now
his
credit
can
stand
it
and
you
to
mind
why
some
of
our
most
fashionable
families
now
contain
freaks
like
me
it
becoming
quite
smart
just
as
in
former
days
one
of
the
sons
would
go
into
the
church
or
the
navy
lucy
well
of
course
i
am
but
going
every
day
with
the
men
it
seems
so
unwomanly
helen
but
was
i
womanly
for
years
instead
of
going
and
working
with
highbrows
i
stayed
and
played
with
lowbrows
until
i
was
bored
to
death
lucy
yes
that
what
comes
of
going
to
college
leaving
the
home
getting
these
new
ideas
all
the
same
helen
the
men
really
nice
men
like
it
helen
well
you
see
i
do
like
really
nice
men
so
that
makes
it
agreeable
all
around
lucy
if
it
were
only
art
or
music
or
something
feminine
but
that
awful
laboratory
how
can
a
lady
poison
poor
innocent
little
monkeys
helen
if
i
were
a
lady
i
with
monkeys
do
you
know
what
the
word
means
lucy
in
times
lady
meant
one
who
gives
loaves
now
one
who
a
loaf
lucy
very
clever
my
dear
but
some
day
you
be
sorry
no
man
helen
likes
a
woman
to
have
independent
views
jean
helen
can
afford
to
have
independent
views
she
has
an
independent
income
she
earns
it
lucy
independent
income
her
salary
would
pay
for
your
hats
jean
all
the
same
i
wish
i
had
gone
to
college
i
wish
i
had
learned
a
profession
lucy
what
have
these
new
women
accomplished
just
one
thing
they
are
destroying
chivalry
helen
not
entirely
lucy
not
entirely
for
instance
i
am
the
best
assistant
ernest
hamilton
has
but
the
worst
paid
the
others
are
all
men
hurray
for
chivalry
lucy
well
i
just
an
wife
woman
sphere
is
the
home
my
husband
says
so
helen
but
suppose
you
have
any
husband
what
can
a
spinster
do
in
the
home
lucy
in
it
till
she
gets
one
that
what
the
spinster
used
to
do
helen
the
spinster
used
to
spin
lucy
at
any
rate
the
spinster
did
not
stay
out
of
her
home
all
night
and
get
herself
compromised
talked
about
sent
abroad
or
if
she
did
she
knew
enough
to
remain
abroad
until
the
gossip
blew
over
turns
to
helen
ah
that
wonderful
night
turns
back
the
night
we
discovered
the
hamilton
antitoxin
the
night
that
made
the
baker
institute
famous
and
just
think
i
had
a
hand
in
it
lucy
a
hand
in
the
unwomanly
work
of
saving
children
lives
but
of
course
an
spinster
would
have
blushed
and
said
excuse
me
doctor
hamilton
but
we
must
now
let
a
year
work
go
to
waste
because
you
are
a
man
and
i
am
a
woman
and
it
dark
outdoors
that
the
way
to
preserve
true
chivalry
lucy
you
think
we
ca
see
through
all
this
science
fiddlesticks
the
young
scientist
that
why
you
could
stay
abroad
we
see
it
john
sees
it
and
now
every
one
will
see
it
then
how
will
you
feel
helen
ernest
rather
is
he
lucy
do
you
think
your
brother
will
let
you
marry
a
mere
scientist
oh
well
doctor
hamilton
is
in
love
with
his
work
fortunately
besides
he
a
thoroughbred
he
would
even
look
at
a
girl
who
throws
herself
at
his
head
helen
so
i
need
try
any
longer
too
bad
lucy
her
temper
and
oh
you
new
women
are
quite
superior
are
you
thank
heavens
little
jean
did
elbow
way
into
men
affairs
she
had
no
unwomanly
ambitions
for
a
career
but
she
is
engaged
to
rex
baker
helen
jean
is
this
true
lucy
is
woman
only
true
career
helen
jean
you
ca
you
wo
you
must
marry
rex
lucy
she
who
will
not
when
she
may
my
dear
jean
helen
lucy
hears
john
coming
he
take
her
head
off
if
she
were
there
to
meet
him
only
looks
at
he
bullies
and
browbeats
her
worse
than
ever
i
ca
stand
it
here
much
longer
it
getting
on
my
nerves
helen
jean
you
care
for
rex
no
more
than
i
do
jean
john
bringing
out
uncle
everett
and
cousin
theodore
my
dear
the
whole
family
is
up
in
the
air
about

oh
i
can
take
care
of

but
you
jean

the
sort
to
marry
rex
or
any
other
man
unless
you
simply
ca
live
without
him
jean
a
little
well
how
can
i
live
without
him
without
some
man
you
can
support
yourself
i
ca
helen
but
you
would
live
on
a
man
you
did
really
love
jean
why
not
lucy
does
most
wives
live
on
men
they
do
really
love
to
stop
doing
so
and
get
divorced
is
wrong
you
know
helen
jean
jean
poor
little
jean
jean
well
i
rather
have
domestic
unhappiness
of
my
own
than
watch
other
people
all
my
life
helen
i
do
like
to
hurt
you
dear
but
jean
face
and
raises
how
about

low
bob

at
the
law
school
helen
helen
ca
you
wait
dear
jean
he
never
asked
me
to
helen
helen
he
would
if
you
let
him
jean
it
would
be
fair
it
takes
so
long
to
get
started
everything
costs
so
much
why
nowadays
men

professions
unless
they
have
private
means
ca
marry

nearly
when

be
forty

girl
really
cares
jean
helen
do
know

never
mind
about
me
you
jean

get
over
it
i
suppose

do
some
day
perhaps
he
smile
and
say
just
think
i
once
loved
fat
old
thing
changes
to
helen
when
rex
caught
me
and
kissed
me
i
shut
my
eyes
and
tried
to
think
it
was
bob
helen
jean
in
her
you
ca
keep
on
thinking
so
dear
jean
but
that
is
the
worst
when
he
held
me
fast
and
i
could
get
away
i
began
to
forget
bob
to
forget
everything
off
overcome
with
but
not
now
not
now
it
not
the
same
thing
at
all
face
in
helen
breast
and
sobs
it
oh
i
feel
like
the
devil
dear
and
all
this
time
he
does
really
want
me

wants
you

trapped
him
into
it
i

it
if

a
cynical
tolerance

rather
theodore
a
rector
who
though
he
buttons

character
enough
for
that
judge
we
been
making
sacrifices
for
years
a
quarter
of
a
century
character
enough

last
us
now
why
i
remember
the
first
dinner
we
had
together
after
we
were
pronounced
man
and
wife
with
a
full
choral
service
and
a
great
many
expensive
flowers
quite
a
smart
wedding
lucy
for
those
simple
days
darling
i
asked
my
blushing
bride
do
you
like
i
adore
it
dearest
she
murmured
i
hated
it
but
nobly
sacrificed
myself
and
gave
her
and
gained
character
every
evening
of
our
honeymoon
then
when
we
got
back
and
began
our
new
life
together
in
our
little
home
my
darling
gave
and
indigestion
a
until

did
you
tell
her
judge

did
i
did
got
chronic
dyspepsia
and
struck

this
stuff
i
said
but

i
dearest
says
she
then
why
in
thunder
have
you
had
it
all
these
years
for
your
sake
and
that
tells
the
whole
story
of
our
married
life
we
have
nothing
in
common
but
a
love
of
divorce
and
a
mutual
abhorrence
of
two
souls
with
but
a
single
thought
two
hearts
that
beat
as
one
it
has
been
the
dream
of
our
lives
to
get
apart
and
each
has
nobly
refrained
for
the
sake
and
all
in
vain
john
bah
all
a
cloak
to
hide
his
real
motive
and
he
knows
it
judge
a
painful
i
may
as
well
confess
around
to
see
if
overheard
for
over
twenty
years
i
i
have
broken
my
marriage
vow
drops
her
eyes
theodore
aghast
john
wags
so
has
your
aunt
julia
theodore
no
not
that
judge
well
we
solemnly
promised
to
love
each
other
until
death
did
us
part
we
have
broken
that
sacred
vow
i
do
love
she
does
love
not
in
the
least
john
rot
a
matured
man
a
distinguished
member
of
the
bar
break
up
his
home
for
that
damned
rot
judge
right
again
john
that
not
why
i
breaking
up
my
home
i
prefer
my
club
what
does
the
modern
home
amount
to
merely
a
place
to
leave
your
wife
lucy
of
course
it
does
matter
about
the
poor
little
wife
left
at
home
judge
wrong
lucy
it
does
matter
that
why
i
at
home
and
was
bored
to
death
with
her
prattle
about
clothes
and
the
opera
instead
of
dining
at
the
club
with
my
intellectual
equals
picking
up
business
there
getting
rich
like
john
supplying
her
with
clothes
and
a
whole
at
the
opera
like
yours
lucy
lucy
a
glance
at
her
oh
that
the
way
you
men
talk
it
never
occurs
to
you
that
business
business
is
as
much
of
a
bore
to
us
judge
wrong
again
it
did
occur
to
hence
the
divorce
she
could
stand
seeing
bored
i
could
stand
seeing
bored
once
we
could
deceive
each
other
but
now
too
well
acquainted
our
happy
home
a
hollow
mockery
theodore
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
i
love
my
home
john
so
do
i
glances
sternly
at
lucy
so
do
i
judge
all
right
stick
to
it
if
you
love
it
only
do
claim
credit
for
doing
what
you
enjoy
i
stuck
to
my
home
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
disliked
it
the
whole
time
at
last
i
free
to
say
so
just
think
of
it
lucy
free
to
utter
those
things
about
marriage
we
all
know
are
true
but
do
dare
say
free
to
be
honest
john
no
longer
a
hypocrite
no
longer
a
liar
a
soul
set
free
theodore
two
souls
in
fact
two
souls
with
but
a
single
thought
theodore
stop
you
have
to
consider
not
merely
your
own
selfish
happiness
lucy
yes
think
of
tom
and
little
julia

we
did
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
sacrificed
everything
to
them
even
our
but
now
what
the
use
we
are
childless
now
tom
and
julia
have
both
left
us
for
little
homes
of
their
own
to
love
theodore
ah
but
do
you
want
them
to
have
the
old
home
to
come
back
to
judge

place
like
home

too
much
of
it

very
pretty
parasol
but
it
was
made
in
heaven
you
see
god
made
poor
dear
julia
pale
but
on
that
fatal
day
years
ago
the
pink
parasol
not
god
made
her
rosy
and
irresistible
i
did
the
rest
with
the
aid
of
a
clergyman
whom
i
tipped
even
more
liberally
than
the
waiter
who
served
us
blame
for
it
blame
her
the
parasol
the
parson
but
do
not
my
dear
theodore
blame
the
deity
for
our
own
mistakes
it
so
blasphemous
pause
lucy
takes
place
at
the
to
serve
lucy
and
to
think
we
invited
of
all
people
here
of
all
days
we
must
let
rex
know
the
bakers
do
believe
in
divorce
john
what
this
you
do
mean
that
jean
lucy
yes
just
in
time
before
he
knew
helen
was
back
john
she
landed
him
she
landed
him
we
marrying
into
the
baker
family
the
baker
family
hands
right
and
why
have
more
money
than
any
of
us
well
well
we
all
have
to
stand
around
before
little
jean
now
my
my
lucy
you
a
wonder
those
pearls
i
buy
them
they
yours
hurray
for
lucy
lucy
lucy
her
now
if
i
could
only
get
out
of
this
awful
mess
and
safely
married
to
some
nice
man
judge
his
meaning
one
having
money
theodore
the
hamiltons
are
an
older
family
than
the
bakers
lucy
older
than
our
own
judge
meaning
they
had
money
john
pacing
to
and
waste
a
beauty
on
a
bacteriologist
a
crime
theodore
see
here
john
ernest
hamilton
is
the
biggest
thing
you
got
in
the
baker
institute
one
of
the
loveliest
fellows
in
the
world
too
and
if
you
expect
me
why
did
you
ask
us
here
anyway
judge
far
as
i
can
make
out
we
here
to
help
one
of
john
sisters
marry
a
man
she
does
love
and
prevent
the
other
from
marrying
the
man
she
does
john
oh
look
here
i
nothing
against
young
hamilton
i
him
proud
of
all
he
done
for
the
institute
why
baker
is
tickled
to
death
about
the
hamilton
antitoxin
but
theodore
this
is
a
practical
world
your
scientific
friend
gets
just
two
thousand
dollars
a
year
lucy
send
for
helen
goes
judge
well
why
not
give
the
young
man
a
raise
john
oh
that
not
a
bad
salary
for
scientists
college
professors
and
that
sort
of
thing
why
even
the
head
of
the
institute
himself
gets
less
than
the
superintendent
of
my
mills
no
future
in
science
judge
perfectly
practical
theodore
the
superintendent
of
john
mills
saves
the
company
thousands
of
dollars
these
bacteriologists
merely
save
the
nation
thousands
of
babies
all
our
laws
written
and
unwritten
value
private
property
above
human
life
i
a
distinguished
jurist
and
i
always
render
my
decisions
accordingly
i
be
reversed
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
if
i
did
we
all
rewarded
in
inverse
ratio
to
our
usefulness
to
society
theodore
that
why
practical
men
think
changes
are
dangerous
john
judge
it
all
on
a
sliding
scale
john
for
keeping
up
the
cost
of
living
you
and
old
man
baker
get
arms
out
full
heaven
only
knows
how
much
for
saving
the
constitution
i
get
a
good
deal
three
feet
for
saving
in
wages
and
operating
expenses
your
superintendent
gets
so
much
two
feet
for
saving
human
life
ernest
hamilton
gets
that
six
inches
for
saving
immortal
souls
theodore
gets
up
two
forefingers
an
inch
now
if
any
one
came
along
and
saved
the
world
theodore
they
crucified
him
john
lucy
tried
my
best
john
but
helen
says
she
prefers
to
talk
with
you
alone
some
time
john
she
prefers
see
here
am
i
master
in
my
own
house
or
not
judge
but
helen
is
a
guest
in
it
now
no
longer
under
your
control
john
she
the
new
woman
theodore
john
ca
stop
that
girl
marrying
ernest
if
she
wants
to
he
head
over
heels
in
love
with
her
lucy
what
we
thought
he
was
in
love
with
his
work
theodore
he
thinks
there
no
hope
for
him
poor
boy
lucy
and
she
is
mad
about
him
john
and
he
is
on
the
way
out
here
now
theodore
what
he
coming
to
see
her
john
no
no
thinks
she
still
in
paris
so
she
was
when
i
invited
him
damn
it
but
something
had
to
be
done
and
done
delicately
that
why
i
invited
you
two
judge
out
beautiful
these
lovers
have
met
for
a
month
and
there
a
moon
theodore
you
may
as
well
give
in
john
it
the
simplest
solution
lucy
yes
john
she
nearly
thirty
and
think
how
she
treats
all
the
men
john
who
doing
this
you
go
tell
helen
that
her
uncle
everett
wants
to
see
her
shrugs
starts
reluctantly
and
lingers
theodore
now
uncle
you
have
more
influence
over
her
than
any
of
us
do
let
her
know
about
aunt
julia
helen
thinks
the
world
of
you
judge
of
course
not
never
let
the
rising
generation
suspect
the
truth
about
marriage
if
you
want
to
marry
theodore
there
are
other
truths
than
unpleasant
truths
uncle
everett
other
marriages
than
unhappy
marriages
judge
want
me
to
tell
her
the
truth
about
your
marriage
lucy
the
why
uncle
even
must
admit
that
theodore
and
mary
are
happy
is
too
much
surprised
to
notice
lucy
judge
happy
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
marriage
is
a
social
institution
theodore
said
so
every
time
a
boy
kisses
a
girl
she
should
first
inquire
a
sacrifice
for
society
and
if
he
says
i
want
to
gain
character
sweetheart
then
darling
do
your
duty
and
he
do
it
lucy
well
theodore
has
certainly
done
duty
by
society
six
children
judge
then
society
has
done
its
duty
by
theodore
only
one
salary
john
the
more
credit
to
him
he
and
mary
have
sacrificed
everything
to
their
children
and
the
church
even
health
theodore
we
do
need
your
pity
we
do
want
your
praise
poverty
suffering
even
separation
have
only
drawn
us
closer
together
we
love
each
other
through
it
all
why
in
the
last
letter
the
doctor
let
her
write
she
said
she
said
overcome
with
emotion
turns
if
you
excuse
me
lucy
sanitarium
the
telephone
goes
into
the
judge
not
praise
or
pity
but
something
more
substantial
and
by
george
get
it
for
them
to
john
who
john
see
the
example
sets
to
society
i
honor
him
for
it
judge
fine
but
that
does
seem
to
restore
mary
radiant
health
brilliant
youth
lucy
ah
but
they
have
their
think
how
they
adore
those
beautiful
children
judge
no
do
think
how
they
adore
them
think
how
they
those
beautiful
children
in
the
streets
one
little
daughter
dead
from
contagion
one
son
going
to
the
devil
from
other
things
picked
up
in
the
street
if
marriage
is
a
social
institution
look
at
it
socially
why
a
marriage
like
mine
is
worth
a
dozen
like
theirs
to
society
look
at
my
children
look
at
my
useful
career
as
a
jackal
to
big
business
look
at
my
now
perfectly
contented
spouse
lucy
but
if
you
are
divorced
judge
is
the
object
of
marriage
merely
to
stay
married
lucy
but
character
think
of
the
character
they
have
gained
judge
oh
is
it
to
gain
character
at
the
expense
of
helpless
offspring
society
does
gain
by
that
it
loses
lucy
it
loses
but
simply
because
god
bless
they
love
each
other
through
it
all
you
sentimental
standpatters
believe
in
lying
about
it
do
you
john
whips
out
pocket
and
fountain
oh
talk
talk
talk
money
talks
for
but
they
both
so
confoundedly
proud
judge
go
on
write
that
check
they
must
sacrifice
their
pride
john
nothing
else
left
to
sacrifice
i
afraid
john
well
you
get
this
to
them
somehow
check
to
judge
aha
talk
did
it
five
thousand
generous
john
john
never
mind
about
me
problem
is
all
settled
now
about
helen
lucy
i
thought
i
told
you
in
a
guilty
hurry
escapes
into
the
judge
john
charity
never
settles
problems
it
perpetuates
them
you
cure
social
defects
by
individual
treatment
john
does
talk
settle
anything
judge
everything
we
may
even
settle
the
marriage
problem
if
we
talk
returns
from
telephoning
to
the
theodore
it
all
right
john
honestly
believes
in
setting
an
example
to
society
crazy
to
have
his
sisters
go
and
do
likewise
theodore
splendid
john
i
knew
you
see
it
an
ideal
match
judge
right
theodore
ideal
this
scientific
suitor
will
shower
everything
upon
her
john
honors
and
admires
a
host
of
servants
i
mean
sacrifices
carriages
and
motors
i
mean
character
and
morals
just
what
her
brother
advocates
in
for
others
an
ideal
marriage
john
in
you
think
you
awfully
funny
do
you
humph
i
do
more
for
the
church
for
education
art
science
than
all
the
rest
of
the
family
combined
incidentally
i
not
divorced
but
this
is
a
practical
world
theodore
i
got
to
protect
my
own
lucy
helen
will
be
here
in
a
minute
john
getting
an
ah
i
have
it
i
know
how
to
keep
them
apart
theodore
be
careful
john
these
two
love
each
other
judge
yes
young
people
still
fall
in
love
whether
we
make
it
hard
or
easy
for
them
they
do
it
but
mark
my
words
unless
we
there
is
going
to
be
a
sympathetic
against
it
as
there
is
already
against
having
children
instead
of
making
it
harder
to
get
apart
we
got
to
make
it
easier
to
stay
together
otherwise
the
ancient
bluff
will
soon
be
called
lucy
sssh
here
she
comes
theodore
do
talk
this
way
before
her
judge
all
right
i
not
divorced
yet
still
in
the
conspiracy
of
silence
appears
at
the
door
a
sudden
helen
theodore
and
judge
i
sorry
to
hear
about
dear
mary
but
why
aunt
julia
come
is
she
ill
too
panic
in
the
family
judge
she
gone
to
janeiro
i
mean
to
santa
barbara
wants
a
complete
change
the
rest
cure
theodore
lie
number
one
silence
lucy
makes
tea
for
helen
the
well
go
on
theodore
go
on
with
what
helen
your
discussion
of
marriage
lucy
how
did
you
know
helen
oh
it
in
the
air
everybody
talking
about
it
nowadays
sips
tea
and
the
others
look
theodore
my
dear
marriage
is
woman
only
true
career
helen
her
shield
of
so
lucy
tells
me
cousin
theodore
but
a
woman
can
not
pursue
her
career
she
must
be
pursued
by
it
otherwise
she
is
unwomanly
judge
ahem
as
we
passed
through
the
library
a
while
ago
i
think
i
saw
your
little
sister
being
pursued
by
her
career
helen
yes
uncle
but
jean
is
a
true
woman
i
only
a
new
woman
judge
all
the
same
you
be
an
old
woman
some
day
if
you
do
watch
out
helen
ah
yes
my
life
a
failure
i
have
trapped
a
man
into
a
contract
to
support
me
lucy
up
knitting
bag
and
does
her
best
to
look
like
just
an
wife
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
making
marriage
so
mercenary
helen
dear
have
you
new
women
any
sentiment
helen
enough
sentiment
not
to
make
a
mercenary
marriage
lucy
dear
judge
ahem
and
what
kind
of
a
marriage
do
you
expect
to
make
helen
not
any
thank
you
uncle
judge
what
you
do
believe
in
holy
matrimony
helen
only
as
a
last
extremity
uncle
like
unholy
divorce
judge
what
do
know
about
that
helen
i
know
all
about
it
i
have
been
reading
up
on
the
subject
relax
relieved
but
now
gather
about
the
young
theodore
come
now
simply
because
many
young
people
rush
into
marriage
without
thinking
lucy
simply
because
these
new
women
john
simply
because
one
marriage
in
a
thousand
ends
in
divorce
helen
wait
one
in
a
thousand
dear
me
what
an
idealist
you
are
john
in
america
one
marriage
in
every
eleven
now
ends
in
divorce
and
yet
you
wonder
why
i
hesitate
john
one
in
eleven
rot
all
this
should
be
suppressed
by
the
government
one
in
eleven
bah
helen
the
government
own
statistics
john
all
turn
to
the
judge
for
denial
but
he
nods
confirmation
with
a
complacent
smile
murmuring
two
souls
with
but
a
single
thought
lucy
well
i
may
be
but
it
seems
to
that
nice
girls
should
of
such
things
their
husbands
will
tell
them
all
they
ought
to
know
about
marriage
after
they
married
helen
ah
i
see
nice
girls
must
think
until
after
they
rush
in
but
they
must
rush
in
until
after
they
think
you
married
people
make
it
all
so
simple
for
us
judge
right
the
way
to
cure
all
evil
is
for
nice
people
to
close
their
minds
and
mouths
to
it
it
unpleasant
for
a
pure
mind
and
it
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
the
mouth
so
there
you
are
my
dear
john
in
oh
talk
talk
talk
i
had
enough
see
here
young
lady
i
offered
to
pay
all
your
expenses
abroad
for
a
year
you
did
seem
to
appreciate
it
well
the
trustees
of
the
institute
are
now
to
give
doctor
hamilton
a
year
abroad
how
do
you
like
that
turn
and
look
at
helen
splendid
just
what
he
needs
doctor
metchnikoff
told
me
in
paris
that
america
always
kills
its
big
men
with
routine
when
do
we
start
tries
to
look
very
john
to
his
we
do
you
think
are
going
helen
of
course
i
his
assistant
quite
indispensable
to
him
oh
well
if
you
do
believe
me
ask
him
john
to
and
what
next
paris
alone
with
a
man
here
where
i
call
a
halt
helen
but
if
my
work
calls
me
i
do
really
see
what
you
have
to
say
about
it
john
john
better
not
defy
me
helen
helen
better
not
bully
me
john
john
i
am
your
brother
helen
but
not
my
owner
instead
of
defiance
she
turns
with
animated
interest
to
the
you
know
all
women
used
to
be
owned
by
men
formerly
they
ruled
us
by
physical
force
now
by
financial
force
but
at
last
they
are
to
lose
even
hold
upon
us
poor
dears
john
shoulder
john
but
that
all
right
in
theory
but
this
is
a
practical
world
my
pull
got
you
into
the
institute
my
pull
can
get
you
out
you
give
up
this
wild
idea
or
give
up
your
job
helen
what
did
i
tell
you
financial
force
they
still
try
it
you
see
what
if
i
refused
to
give
up
either
john
john
then
as
a
trustee
of
the
institute
i
ask
for
your
resignation
right
here
and
now
i
guess
will
hold
her
at
home
a
while
helen
i
simply
go
to
paris
now
i
nothing
else
to
do
john
a
confident
you
will
eh
who
pay
your
expenses
this
time
helen
of
doctor
hamilton
lucy
helen
please
you
ought
to
say
such
things
even
in
joke
helen
he
take
me
along
as
his
private
secretary
if
i
ask
him
pause
the
others
look
at
one
another
judge
john
she
got
you
you
might
as
well
quit
john
nonsense
i
have
just
begun
you
see
theodore
if
you
so
independent
my
dear
why
do
you
marry
your
scientist
and
be
done
with
it
helen
the
intrusion
but
hides
her
can
you
keep
a
secret
all
seem
to
think
they
can
and
gather
he
has
never
asked
me
family
seems
lucy
no
wonder
dear
he
has
never
seen
you
except
in
that
awful
apron
but
those
stunning
dinner
gowns
john
bought
you
in
paris
my
dear
in
evening
dress
you
are
quite
irresistible
judge
to
irresistible
pink
parasols
what
a
system
helen
but
you
see
i
do
him
to
ask
me
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
keep
him
from
it
family
seems
john
she
got
sense
left
lucy
but
suppose
he
did
ask
you
dear
helen
why
i
simply
refer
the
matter
to
john
of
course
if
john
said
love
him
i
love
him
if
john
said
do
love
him
i
turn
it
off
like
electric
light
family
is
becoming
lucy
oh
you
ca
deceive
us
we
know
how
much
you
admire
him
helen
helen
oh
no
you
do
family
is
not
even
he
does
did
you
ever
hear
how
he

hamilton
discoverer

is
a
fellow
of
about
without
the
spectacles
or
somehow
expected
of
scientific
genius
he
talks
little
but
very
rapidly
and
sees
everything
it
does
not
occur
to
him
to
be
shy
or
embarrassed
in
these
surroundings
not
because
he
is
habituated
to
so
much
luxury
on
three
thousand
a
year
nor
because
he
despises
it
he
likes
it
but
he
likes
other
things
even
more
that
is
why
he
works
for
two
thousand
a
year
instead
of
working
for
fat
fashionable
fees
in
private
meets
his
distinguished
guest
at
the
door
effusively
yet
with
that
smiling
condescension

college
professors

of
thing

says
the
panama
canal
could
not
have
been
built
if
it
had
been
for
you
scientists
not
only
that
but
you
have
abolished
forever
from
the
united

a
scourge
which
for
more
than
a
century
had
through
periodic
outbreaks
spread
terror
devastation
and
death
ernest
but
trying
to
hide
the
ones
who
deserve
your
praise
are
the
four
who
died
to
prove
that

you
all
know
their

looks
at

who
looks
at

who
looks
at
lucy
who
looks
at
theodore
he
takes
up
his
delicious
tea
theodore
ah
but
they
did
do
it
for
fame
for
money
that
the
beauty
of
the
sacrifice
ernest
a
quite
so
that
what
congress
told
us
when
we
suggested
a
pension
for
the
widow
of
the
first
victim
all
what
did
congress
refuse
the
pension
ernest
his
they
finally
voted
the
sum
of
seventeen
dollars
a
month
for
the
widow
and
no
less
than
two
dollars
a
month
extra
for
each
of
his
children
lucy
is
that
all
ernest
no
we
pestered
congress
to
death
until
a
few
years
ago
they
replaced
the
pension
with
an
annuity
of
one
hundred
and
dollars
a
month
though
some
of
them
said
it
was
a
very
bad
precedent
to
establish
cup
to
no
more
thanks
delicious
turns
to
admire
the
view
of
the
farm
hands
in
john
a
well
i
think
our
scientists
might
well
be
called
philanthropists
ernest
hardly
you
see
every
one
the
names
of
philanthropists
better
let
it
go
at
scientists
judge
he
right
philanthropists
do
give
their
lives
they
give
their
names
have
carved
in
stone
over
their
institutes
and
libraries
approaches
and
joins
his
ernest
charming
little
farm
you
have
here
john
doctor
hamilton
america
kills
its
big
men
with
routine
you
are
too
valuable
to
the
nation
to
lose
the
trustees
think
you
need
a
year
abroad
ernest
that
strange
i
came
out
here
to
suggest
that
very
thing
somebody
has
been
saying
kind
things
about
me
in
paris
just
had
a
letter
from
the
great
metchnikoff
wants
me
to
come
over
and
work
in
the
pasteur
chance
of
a
lifetime
you
did
have
to
jolly
me
up
to
consent
to
that
john
terrace
with
his
guest
arm
in
by
the
by
my
sister
is
rather
keen
on
science
ernest
best
assistant
i
ever
had
you
can
pile
an
awful
lot
of
routine
on
a
woman
the
female
of
the
species
is
more
faithful
than
the
male
she
over
there
already
we
can
get
right
to
work
john
she
be
back
before
you
start
ernest
i
did
know
that
well
what
is
it
hesitates
turns
to
the
family
all
watching
with
breathless
theodore
do
you
see
old
chap
under
the
circumstances
it
would
hardly
do
for
her
to
go
back
to
paris
with
you
ernest
why
not
lucy
you
a
man
ernest
you
mean
i
dangerous
lucy
but
she
a
woman
judge
they
mean
dangerous
john
my
dear
fellow
we
are
going
to
ask
you
quite
frankly
to
decline
to
take
her
ernest
about
at
the
circle
of
anxious
faces
he
wont
let
them
read
so
that
it
eh
but
it
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
for
her
too
she
needs
it
more
than
i
do
she
had
so
little
chance
to
do
original
work
john
but
she
a
woman
ernest
just
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
john
everything
we
have
the
highest
respect
for
you
doctor
hamilton
but
also
one
must
respect
the
opinions
of
the
world
you
know
ernest
it
that
right
one
must
i
forgot
to
think
of
that
it
curious
but
when
working
with
women
of
ability
one
learns
to
respect
them
so
much
that
one
quite
loses
the
habit
of
insulting
them
too
bad
how
new
conditions
spoil
fine
old
customs
suppose
you
let
her
go
and
let
me
stay
i
can
find
plenty
to
do
here
i
fancy
john
i
fear
it
would
offend
our
generous
benefactor
baker
he
has
set
his
heart
on
your
going
abroad
meeting
other
big
men
getting
new
ideas
for
our
great
humanitarian
work
family
exchange
glances
while
john
lies
besides
my
sister
would
only
go
to
accommodate
you
she
particularly
desires
to
stay
here
this
winter
that
why
she
is
returning
so
soon
you
see
ernest
oh
i
see
i
sure
i
have
no
desire
to
her
over
with
me
at
i
rather
thought
the
opportunity
to
continue
our
experiments
together
but
that
all
right
john
then
it
all
settled
you
agree
to
go
alone
ernest
slight
yes
alone
it
quite
settled
john
how
soon
could
you
start
ernest
how
soon
why
just
as
soon
as
i
get
some
one
to
run
my
department
john
could
my
sister
run
it
ernest
could
she
run
it
it
ca
run
without
her
she
as
systematic
as
as
a
good
housekeeper
john
a
satisfied
look
at

her
that
you
want
her
to

you
arrange
to
start

i
could
john
a
triumphant
look
at
the
then
i
telephone
for
your
passage
i
have
a
pull
with
all
the
steamship
lines
of
course
i
hate
to
cut
short
your
but
i
do
want
to
spoil
any
scientific
careers
hurries
in
to
telephone
ernest
starts
too
as
if
to
stop
him
but
restrains
the
impulse
he
stands
alone
by
the
door
gazing
out
over
the
landscape
while
lucy
theodore
and
the
judge
discuss
him
in
low
tones
by
the
lucy

stupid
men

no
hope

when

right
one
comes
along

along
stealing
up
the
steps
from
the
garden
on
tiptoe
with
the
grave
absorbed
look
of
a
hunter
stalking
game
she
catches
sight
of
the
man
she
wants
and
stops
short
as
motionless
as
if
frozen
but
not
so
her
lovely
hands
were
poised
one
of
them
now
goes
to
her
bosom
and
presses
there
there
is
nothing
icy
about
this
new
woman
ernest
unconscious
of
danger
as
a
on
an
inaccessible
height
smiles
easily
at
his
sentimental
old
friend

the
right

sight
of

shakes
her
head
in

a
finger
on

in
a
panic
flees
noiselessly
across
toward
the
theodore

then
do
let
her
go
by

at
the
door
and
makes
a
face
at

theodore
all
the

i
bet
you
would
let

little
thing

really
cared
for
a

so
confoundedly
ambitious
to
do
original
work
why
is
it
women
can
stand
day
after
day
of
monotonous
detail
better
than
men
helen
because
men
always
made
them

like
a
good
love
scene
in
the
scientific
spirit
helen

said
about
you
and
your
future
judge
sst
and

the
scientific
spirit
judge
saunters
off
into
the
garden
ernest
how
did
you
ever
meet
metchnikoff
helen
i
had
worked
under
hamilton
they
wanted
to
meet
me
ernest
an
unmistakable
u
was
that
why
did
you
let
them
know
your
part
in
that
discovery
why
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
should
never
have
stumbled
upon
the
thing
at
all
helen
oh
i
know
my
place
too
well
for
that
talk
about
temperament
you
scientists
are
worse
than
prima
donnas
ernest
printers
proofs
out
of
pocket
hands
them
to
her
in
some
proofs
of
a
monograph
i
was
correcting
on
the
train
mind
hammering
those
loose
sentences
of
mine
into
decent
english
you
can
write
i
ca
helen
recent
experiments
in
anterior
poliomyelitis
by
ernest
hamilton
and
helen
what
why
you
put
name
with
yours
excited
and
ernest
well
if
you
object
like
a
prima
donna
out
pencil
to
mark
on
helen
proofs
object
why
this
makes
my
reputation
in
the
scientific
world
ernest
well
did
you
make
mine
helen
glowing
with
pride
but
touched
by
his
unexpected
you
ca
imagine
what
this
means
to
me
it
so
hard
for
a
woman
to
get
any
recognition
most
men
have
but
one
use
for
us
if
we
get
interested
in
anything
but
it
is
unwomanly
they
call
it
a
fad

with
ernest
hamilton
to
her
name
and
swaggers
back
and

very
exceptional
woman

have
a
mind
like
a

tempting
if

and

thank
god

for
while
we
worked
there
together
i
came
to
know
you
as
few
men
ever
know
the
women
they
desire
woman
can
be
more
than
sex
as
man
is
more
than
sex
and
all
this
makes
man
and
woman
not
less
but
more
desirable
and
necessary
to
each
other
and
makes
both
things
last
not
for
a
few
years
but
forever
of
voices
approaching
from
the
garden
the
lovers
separate

a
gasp
of
joy

rapturous
embrace

silence
with
the
moonlight
streaming
down
upon
them
the
music
has
dressed
for
dinner
strolls
out
upon
the
terrace
he
stops
abruptly
upon
discovering
them
the
lovers
are
too
absorbed
to
be
aware
of
his
act
ii
is
the
next
morning
appears
that
at
john
country
place
they
have
breakfast
at
small
tables

upon
the
broad
shaded
terrace
overlooking
the
glorious
view
of
his
little
and
theodore
the
scientist
and
the
clergyman
are
breakfasting
together
the
others
are
either
breakfasting
in
their
rooms
or
are
not
yet
down
it
being
man
of
god
is
enjoying
his
material
blessings
heartily
also
he
seems
to
be
enjoying
his
view
of
the
man
of
science
who
eats
little
and
says
theodore
what
the
matter
with
your
appetite
this
morning
ernest
gazing
up
at
one
of
the
windows
does
not
hear
the
door
opens
he
starts
then
seeing
it
only
a
servant
with
food
he
expecting
something
the
codfish
balls
well
here
they
are
refuses
the
proffered
codfish
balls
scowls
brings
out
cigar
case
lights
cigar
looks
at
watch
and
oh
i
know
crazy
to
go
with
me
to
church
does
hear
creates
a
cloud
of
their
regular
rector
is
ill
so
i
agreed
to
take
the
service
this
morning
always
the
way
when
off
for
a
rest
is
it
answer
theodore
gets
up
walks
around
the
table
and
shouts
in
is
it
ernest
i
beg
your
pardon
theodore
ernest
wondering
what
the
oh
you
hopeless
i
ca
stand
people
who
talk
so
much
at
breakfast
ernest
wakes
wait
a
minute
sit
down
have
a
cigar
let
talk
about
god
stops
but
i
mean
it
i
like
to
have
a
religion
myself
theodore
i
had
an
idea
you
took
no
stock
in
religion
the
cigar
ernest
holds
a
match
for
ernest
just
what
i
thought
until
well
i
made
a
discovery
a
great
discovery
theodore
a
scientific
discovery
ernest
a
wave
of
the
it
makes
all
science
look
like
a
mere
machine
theodore
well
if
you
feel
so
strongly
about
it
better
come
to
church
after
all
ernest
i
not
talking
about
the
church
i
talking
about
theodore
you
not
talking
about
religion
you
talking
about
love
ernest
certainly
the
same
thing
is
it
i
talking
about
the
divine
fire
that
glorifies
life
and
perpetuates
it
the
one
eternal
thing
we
mortals
share
with
god
if
is
religious
what
is
smiles
tell
me
theodore
you
know
i
was
allowed
to
go
to
church
when
young
and
since
then
i
always
worked
on
the
holy
sabbath
day
like
yourself
does
the
church
still
let
innocent
human
beings
think
there
something
inherently
wrong
about
sex
drops
his
eyes
ernest
disgusted
with
i
see
good
people
should
drop
their
eyes
even
at
the
mention
of
the
word
theodore
sex
is
a
necessary
evil
i
admit
but
ernest
evil
the
impulse
which
accounts
for
you
sitting
there
for
me
sitting
here
the
splendid
instinct
which
writes
our
poetry
builds
our
civilizations
founds
our
churches
the
very
heart
and
soul
of
life
is
evil
really
theodore
i
do
know
much
about
religion
but
that
strikes
me
as
blasphemy
against
the
creator
theodore
very
scientific
my
boy
very
modern
but
the
church
believed
in
marriage
before
science
was
born
ernest
as
a
compromise
with
evil
theodore
as
a
sacrament
of
religion
and
so
do
you
ernest
good
then
why
practise
and
preach
marriage
as
a
sacrament
of
property
who
giveth
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
women
are
still
goods
and
chattels
to
be
given
or
sold
are
they
theodore
oh
nonsense
ernest
then
why
keep
on
making
them
promise
to
serve
and
obey
why
marry
them
with
a
ring
the
link
of
the
ancient
chain
in
the
days
of
physical
force
it
was
made
of
iron
now
of
gold
but
it
still
a
chain
is
it
theodore
symbols
my
dear
fellow
not
to
be
taken
in
a
literal
sense
and
beautiful
symbols
ernest
but
why
insult
a
woman
you
respect
even
symbolically
theodore
a
oh
you
scientists
ernest
in
the
we
try
to
find
the
truth
and
you
try
to
hide
it
eh
well
there
one
thing
we
have
in
common
anyway
one
faith
i
never
doubt
again
i
believe
in
heaven
now
i
always
shall
theodore
do
you
mind
telling
me
why
my
boy
ernest
not
in

to

a
loud
laugh
turns
to
rather
impertinent
for
a
man
i
think

up
newspaper
lucy
says
nothing
attending
to
his
wants
bah
what
does
this
highbrow

about
the
power
men
of
my
sort
can
use
when
we
have
to
cringes
dutifully
in
silence
john
paper
in
one
hand
brusquely
passes
cup
to
lucy
with
helen
got
her
own
way
about
college
about
work
about
living
in
her
own
apartment
but
if
she
thinks
she
can
put
across
humph
these
modern
women
must
learn
their
place
smiling
timidly
returns
cup
john
takes
it
without
thanks
busied
in
newspapers
a
look
of
resentment
creeps
over
lucy
pretty
face
now
that
he
ca
see
ah
i
got
something
up
my
sleeve
for
that
young
woman
says

life
and
i

john
was
out
here
jean
i
call
him
runs
down
into
the
rex
i
call
him
runs
after
jean
helen
helplessly
watches
them
go
sighs
standing
by
the
garden
steps
until
john
ascends
he
looks
at
helen
a
moment
wondering
how
to
begin
she
looks
so
capable
and
unafraid
of
john
if
you
had
gone
to
college
you
could
have
done
what
jean
is
doing
helen
a
shrug
and
a
but
how
proud
you
must
be
john
to
have
a
sister
who
is
compelled
to
marry
one
man
while
in
love
with
another
are
you
glad
i
went
to
college
laughs
at
john
humph
if
you
think
i
let
a
sister
of
mine
marry
one
of
old
man
baker
employees
helen
why
john
did
ernest
tell
you
doctor
hawksbee
has
offered
him
a
partnership
just
think
of
that
john
what
going
back
into
private
practice
helen
but
it
such
a
fashionable
practice
hawksbee
made
a
million
at
it
john
but
the
institute
needs
hamilton
helen
ah
but
we
need
the
money
john
so
you
are
going
to
spoil
a
noble
career
are
you
that
selfish
i
did
think
it
of
you
there
are
thousands
of
successful
physicians
but
there
is
only
one
ernest
hamilton
helen
oh
do
worry
john
he
has
promised
me
to
keep
his
job
john
ah
i
glad
you
must
let
nothing
interfere
with
his
great
humanitarian
work
think
what
it
means
to
the
lives
of
little
children
think
what
it
means
to
the
future
of
the
race
why
every
one
says
his
greatest
usefulness
has
hardly
begun
helen
oh
i
know
all
that
i
thought
of
all
that
john
now
such
men
should
be
kept
free
from
cares
and
anxiety
what
was
it
you
said
yesterday
he
needs
every
cent
of
his
salary
for
books
travel
all
the
advantages
he
simply
must
have
for
efficiency
to
marry
a
poor
man
most
selfish
thing
a
girl
could
do
helen
yes
john
that
what
i
said
yesterday
john
but
that
was
before
he
asked
you
smiles
he
rather
pleased
with
yourself
now
are
you
just
a
woman
after
all
heroine
of
cheap
magazine
story
sacrifices
career
for
love
all
very
pretty
and
romantic
my
dear
but
how
about
the
man
you
love
want
to
sacrifice
his
career
too
helen
but
i
not
going
to
sacrifice
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
my
career
therefore
he
wo
have
to
sacrifice
his
john
what
going
to
keep
on
working
will
he
let
the
woman
he
loves
work
helen
well
you
see
he
says
i
too
good
to
loaf
john
humph
who
take
care
of
your
home
when
you
at
work
who
take
care
of
your
work
when
you
at
home
look
at
it
practically
to
maintain
such
a
home
as
he
needs
on
such
a
salary
as
he
has
why
it
would
take
all
your
time
all
your
energy
to
keep
him
in
his
class
you
have
to
drop
out
of
your
own
become
a
household
drudge
a
servant
helen
and
if
i
am
willing
john
then
where
your
intellectual
companionship
how
you
help
his
work
expense
for
him
disillusionment
for
both
if
you
the
woman
you
pretend
to
be
you
wo
marry
that
man
helen
the
world
needs
his
work
but
he
needs
mine
and
we
both
need
each
other
john
and
marriage
would
only
handicap
his
work
ruin
yours
and
put
you
apart
you
know
that
true
you
seen
it
happen
with
others
you
have
told
me
so
yourself
helen
then
that
settles
it
we
must
not
can
not
shall
not
marry
we
have
no
right
to
marry
i
agree
with
all
you
say
it
would
not
join
us
together
it
would
put
us
asunder
john
and
you
give
him
up
good
good
helen
give
him
up
never
the
right
to
work
the
right
to
love
those
rights
are
inalienable
no
we
give
up
marriage
but
not
each
other
john
but
but
i
do
understand
helen
in
his
we
need
each
other
in
our
work
and
in
our
life
and
we
to
have
each
other
until
life
is
ended
and
our
work
is
done
now
do
you
understand
john
are
you
in
your
right
mind
think
what
you
saying
helen
i
have
thought
all
night
john
you
have
shown
me
how
to
say
it
john
but
but
why
this
is
utterly
unbelievable
why
i
not
even
shocked
do
you
notice
i
not
even
shocked
because
everything
you
have
said
everything
you
have
done
it
all
proves
that
you
are
a
good
woman
helen
if
i
were
a
bad
woman
i
inveigle
him
into
marriage
john
john
inveigle
marriage
are
you
crazy
oh
this
is
all
one
of
your
highbrow
jokes
helen
john
were
you
serious
when
you
said
marriage
would
destroy
him
john
but
this
would
destroy
helen
well
even
if
that
were
so
which
is
more
important
to
the
world
which
is
more
important
to
your
great
humanitarian
work
john
ah
very
clever
a
bluff
to
gain
my
consent
to
marrying
him
a
trick
to
get
his
salary
raised
helen
john
nothing
you
can
do
nothing
you
can
say
will
ever
gain
my
consent
to
marrying
him
i
not
told
you
half
my
reasons
john
my
god
my
own
sister
and
did
you
for
one
moment
dream
that
i
would
consent
to
that

telling
you
john
scrutinizing
ridiculous
if

your
own
brother

you
suppose

telling
even
my
own
brother
john
at
her
a
moment
she
returns

and
poppycock

touches
i
soon
put
a
stop
to
this
nonsense
damnedest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
helen
john

of
all
when
the
others
come
out
i
going
to
ask

in
the
face
then
you
can
make
this
statement
to
them
if
you
wish
and
look
them
in
the
face
helen
quiet
if
i
were
being
forced
into
such
a
marriage
as
poor
little
jean
i
would
kill
myself
but
in
the
eyes
of
god
who
made
love
no
matter
how
i
may
appear
in
the
eyes
of
man
who
made
marriage

you
come
to
me
at
once
lucy
she
said
she
wanted
to
tell
you
herself
i
did
think
she
dare
all
turn
to
look
at
helen
theodore

back
from
church
helen
it
had
to
be
announced
of
course
theodore
announced

is
announced
turn
to
him
in
a
lucy
their
engagement
theodore
judge
yes
john
has
given
his
consent
at
last
example
to
society
john
overrides
of
course
one
of
the
finest
fellows
in
the
world
theodore
and
withal
he
has
a
deep
religious
nature
congratulations
my
dear
he
make
an
ideal
husband
both
helen
hands
about
to
kiss
helen
help
thank
you
cousin
but
i
do
want
a
husband
sudden
theodore
from
one
to
the
a
lover
quarrel
already
judge
no
theodore
these
lovers
are
in
perfect
accord
they
both
have
conscientious
scruples
against
marriage
john
conscientious
judge
so
they
are
simply
going
to
set
up
housekeeping
without
the
mere
formality
of
a
wedding
ceremony
drops
helen
helen
we
are
going
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
theodore
uncle
everett
her
hands
helen
we
are
not
going
to
set
up
housekeeping
at
all
he
will
keep
his
present
quarters
and
i
mine
john
but
they
are
going
to
belong
to
each
other
theodore
helen
hands
i
do
believe
it
judge
to
the
strike
against
marriage
it
was
bound
to
come
theodore
but
church
and
state
self
and
must
break
this
strike
helen
john
is
a
practical
man
he
will
prove
to
you
that
such
a
home
as
we
could
afford
would
only
be
a
to
ernest
usefulness
a
hollow
sphere
for
mine
you
ca
fill
it
with
mere
happiness
lucy
not
for
long
not
for
long
judge
theodore
about
to
oh
let
her
get
it
all
nicely
talked
out
then
she
take
a
nap
and
wake
up
feeling
better
we
driven
her
to
this
ourselves
but
she
really
does
mean
a
word
of
it
come
dear
child
tell
us
all
about
this
nightmare
helen
at
the
why
think
what
would
happen
to
an
eager
intellect
like
ernest
hamilton
if
he
had
to
come
back
to
a
apartment
or
a
dreary
suburb
every
evening
and
eat
morbid
meals
opposite
a
housewife
regaling
him
with
the
social
ambitions
of
the
other
commuters
ugh
it
has
ruined
enough
brilliant
men
already
restrains
theodore
and
others
who
want
to
now
at
the
university
club
he
dines
at
slight
expense
compared
with
keeping
up
a
home
upon
the
best
food
in
the
city
with
some
of
the
best
scientists
in
the
country
marriage
would
divorce
him
from
all
that
would
transplant
him
from
an
atmosphere
of
ideas
into
an
atmosphere
of
worries
we
should
be
forced
into
the
same
deadly
ruts
as
the
rest
of
you
uncle
do
you
want
me
to
destroy
a
great
career
theodore
theodore
do
you
want
to
be
a
blot
upon
that
career
helen
i
rather
be
a
blot
than
a
blight
and
that
what
i
be
if
i
became
his
bride
ask
john
lucy
do
you
want
to
be
disgraced
despised
ostracized
helen
at
a
choice
of
evils
dear
of
course
none
of
those
costly
wives
on
your
visiting
list
will
call
upon
me
but
instead
of
one
day
at
home
instead
of
making
a
tired
husband
work
for
me
i
have
all
my
days
free
to
work
with
him
like
the
woman
you
admire
instead
of
being
an
expense
i
be
a
help
to
him
instead
of
being
separated
by
marriage
and
divergent
interests
we
be
united
by
love
and
common
peril
is
that
the
orthodox
way
to
gain
character
theodore
john
oh
this
is
all
damned
nonsense
look
here
you
either
got
to
marry
this
fellow
now
or
else
go
away
and
never
see
him
again
never
never
helen
just
what
i
thought
john
i
intended
never
to
see
him
again
that
was
why
i
let
you
send
me
abroad
but
i
never
never
do
it
again
like
an
engaged
it
was
perfectly
dreadful
ernest
could
get
along
without
me
at
all
poor
old
thing
and
i
why
i
nearly
died
john
then
you
have
to
be
married
that
all
the
others
why
of
course
you
have
to
that
all
helen
oh
i
know
just
how
you
feel
about
it
i
thought
so
too
at
first
but
i
ca
marry
ernest
hamilton
i
love
him
theodore
but
if
you
love
him
truly
marriage
my
dear
brings
together
those
who
love
each
other
truly
helen
but
those
who
love
each
other
truly
do
need
anything
to
bring
them
together
the
difficulty
is
to
keep
apart
reminiscent
john
that
all
romantic
rot
every
one
feels
that
way
at
first
helen
at
first
then
the
practical
object
of
marriage
is
not
to
bring
together
those
who
love
each
other
but
to
keep
together
those
who
do
not
what
a
dreadful
thing
marriage
must
be
chokes
down
a
judge
ah
so
you
wish
to
be
free
to
separate
now
we
have
it
helen
to
separate
what
an
idea
on
the
contrary
we
wish
to
be
free
to
keep
together
in
the
old
days
when
they
had
interests
in
common
marriage
used
to
make
man
and
woman
one
but
now
it
puts
them
apart
ca
you
see
it
all
about
you
he
goes
and
works
she
stays
and
plays
he
belongs
to
the
laboring
class
she
belongs
to
the
leisure
class
at
best
they
seldom
work
at
the
same
or
similar
trades
legally
it
may
be
a
union
but
socially
it
a
m√©salliance
in
the
eyes
of
god
it
often
worse
no
wonder
that
one
in
eleven
ends
in
divorce
the
only
way
to
avoid
spiritual
separation
is
to
shun
legal
union
like
a
contagious
disease
modern
marriage
divorce
turns
to
go
i
found
my
work
i
found
my
mate
and
so
has
he
what
more
can
any
human
being
ask
butler
butler
doctor
hamilton
is
outside
in
a
taxicab
sir
john
show
him
here
at
once
butler
he
says
he
does
not
care
to
come
in
sir
unless
you
are
ready
to
talk
to
him
now
john
well
of
all
the
nerve
you
bet
i
ready
off
helen
starts
judge
them
wait
a
minute
wait
a
minute
ask
doctor
hamilton
kindly
to
wait
in
the
library
butler
now
we
all
a
bit
overwrought
helen
pats
her
hand
puts
arm
about
her
gradually
leads
her
i
still
believe
in
you
helen
i
still
believe
in
him
it
simply
that
he
so
deeply
absorbed
in
his
great
work
for
mankind
that
he
does
realize
what
he
is
asking
helen
to
do
helen
so
i
told
him
when
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
all
what
he
you
to
him
helen
of
course
me
to
marry
him
adds
so
absorbed
not
in
mankind
but
in
me
that
he
did
realize
what
he
was
asking
me
to
do
lucy
and
you
refused
him
the
man
who
loves
you
honorably
helen
of
course
you
do
suppose
i
take
advantage
of
the
poor
weakness
women
often
do
i
admit
even
when
not
in
love
sometimes
not
because
they
depraved
but
dependent
john
and
then
he
proposed
this
wicked
substitute
poisoned
her
innocent
mind
the
bounder
helen
but
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
john
oh
your
own
idea
was
it
helen
of
course
john
and
he
is
willing
to
take
advantage
of
the
poor
child
ignorance
the
cad
deep
religious
nature
eh
theodore
i
ca
believe
it
of
him
helen
he
knows
nothing
about
it
yet
i
have
even
seen
him
since
i
made
my
decision
exchange
bewildered
john
to
we
got
to
get
him
off
to
paris
it
our
only
hope
judge

her
following

on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
do
you
want
to
shove
her
over
you
are
dealing
with
big
people
here
and
a
big
passion
butler
butler
doctor
hamilton
asks
to
see
miss
helen
while
waiting
judge
to
tell
doctor
hamilton
that
miss
helen
will
see
him
here
butler
john
are
you
crazy
we
got
to
keep
apart
our
one
chance
to
save
her
judge
no
bring
them
together
is
our
one
chance
come
we
go
down
into
the
garden
and
they
have
a
nice
little
talk
nothing
like
talk
john
honest
talk
to
clear
these
marriage
problems
john
and
let
them
elope
in
that
taxicab
not
on
your
life

and
judge
come
john
girls
never
notify
the
family
in
advance
when
they
plan
elopements
it
not
done
theodore
uncle
everett
is
right
ernest
will
bring
her
to
her
senses
he
a
deep
religious
nature
leads
john
away
to
the
lucy
to
if
you
offer
yourself
on
such
terms
to
the
man
who
loves
you
honorably
he
never
look
at
you
again
theodore
lucy
off
to
do
worry
she
wo
rushes
out
to
helen
ernest
ernest
at
last
takes
her
in
his
arms
she
clings
to
him
and
gazes
into
his
eyes
a
long
tell
me
that
you
all
right
again
helen
with
love
and
except
that
you
deserted
me
dear
just
when
i
needed
you
most
ernest
ernest
never
leave
me
again
ernest
deserted
you
why
your
brother
said
you

mistaken
ernest
and
but

never
let
you
go

got
to
sail
with
me
together

together
helen
are
you

love
me
ernest
from
sheer
joy
of
her
am
i
sure
ten
million
times
more
than
yesterday
helen
even
so
it
is
not
and
can
never
be
as
i
love
you
ernest
her
hands
in
his
then
you
can
apologize
helen
apologize
ernest
for
saying
years
and
years
ago
in
other
words
last
night
that
you
did
think
you
marry
me
after
all
why
what
the
matter
you
trembling
like
a
leaf
you
ill
helen
no
oh
no
ernest
still
a
few
lingering
doubts
i
had
hoped
a
good
night
rest
would
put
those
little
prejudices
to
sleep
forever
helen
sleep
shakes
her
head
gazing
at
him
ernest
so
you
could
not
sleep
neither
could
i
i
was
too
happy
to
sleep
i
was
afraid
i
miss
some
wondrous
throbbing
thought
of
your
loveliness
her
passive
hand
puts
a
kiss
in
it
and
closes
it
reverently
while
she
looks
into
his
eyes
without
do
you
know
disappointed
in
love
i
always
thought
it
meant
soft
sighs
and
pretty
speeches
it
means
an
agony
of
longing
delicious
agony
but
oh
terrific
says
dear
dear
girl
it
may
be
easy
for
you
but
i
ca
stand
much
more
of
this
helen
nor
ernest
you
must
come
to
paris
with
me
or
i
stay
home
all
through
the
night
i
had
waking
visions
of
our
being
parted
just
when
we
had
found
each
other
at
last
some
terrible
impersonal
monster
stepped
in
between
us
and
said
no
now
that
you
have
had
your
glimpse
of
heaven
away
ye
twain
shall
not
enter
here
silly
was
it
but
i
could
get
the
horror
of
it
out
of
my
head
helen
do
you
know
why
ernest
because
it
was
in
mine
it
came
from
my
thought
to
yours
you
and
i
are
attuned
like
wireless
instruments
even
in
the
old
blind
days
there
in
the
laboratory
i
used
to
read
your
mind
shall
i
tell
you
the
name
of
the
monster
that
would
put
us
asunder
its
name
is
marriage
ernest
but
i
need
you
you
know
that
and
you
need
me
it
too
late
we
are
helpless
now
in
the
clutch
of
forces
more
potent
than
our
little
selves
forces
that
brought
us
into
the
world
forces
that
have
made
the
world
whether
you
will
or
no
this
beautiful
binding
power
is
sweeping
you
and
me
together
and
you
must
yield
helen
for
his
ah
my
dear
could
anything
make
it
more
beautiful
more
binding
than
it
is
now
ernest
it
is
perfect
the
one
divine
thing
we
share
with
god
the
church
is
right
in
that
respect
i
used
to
look
upon
marriage
as
a
mere
contract
it
a
religious
sacrament
helen
does
the
wedding
ceremony
make
it
sacred
ernest
that
medi√¶val
incantation
no
love
which
is
given
by
god
not
the
artificial
form
made
by
man
helen
i
knew
it
i
knew
you
see
it
the
mistake
of
all
the
ages
tried
to
make
love
fit
marriage
it
ca
be
done
marriage
must
be
changed
to
fit
love
yes
i
go
to
paris
with
you
ernest
to
take
her
in
his
you
darling
helen
but
not
as
your
wife
ernest
you
mean
without
marriage
helen
i
mean
without
marriage
look
into
each
other
ernest
a
moment
ago
i
thought
i
loved
you
as
much
as
man
could
love
woman
i
was
mistaken
in
you
i
was
mistaken
in
myself
for
now
i
love
you
as
man
never
loved
before
you
superb
you
wonderful
woman
helen
out
her
hand
to
be
shaken
not
then
you
agree
ernest
kisses
her
hand
and
of
course
not
you
blessed
girl
do
you
suppose
i
understand
all
for
my
sake
therefore
for
your
sake
no
helen
then
for
my
sake
for
the
sake
of
everything
our
love
stands
for
ernest
do
you
think
i
let
you
do
anything
for
anybody
sake
you
sure
later
to
regret
helen
then
do
ask
me
to
marry
you
ernest
we
both
regret
that
later
it
would
destroy
the
two
things
that
have
brought
us
together
love
and
work
ernest
nonsense
nothing
could
do
that
and
besides
think
of
our
poor
horrified
families
think
of
the
world
view
helen
are
we
sacrificing
enough
for
the
world
money
comforts
even
children
must
we
also
sacrifice
each
other
to
the
world
must
we
be
hypocrites
because
others
are
must
we
too
be
cowards
and
take
on
the
protective
coloring
of
our
species
ernest
our
ideas
may
be
higher
than
society
but
society
rewards
and
punishes
its
members
according
to
its
own
ideas
not
ours
helen
do
you
want
society
rewards
do
you
fear
society
punishment
ernest
enfolding
with
you
in
my
arms
i
want
nothing
from
heaven
i
fear
nothing
from
hell
but
my
dear
and
comes
down
to
earth
with
a
smile
and
releases
consider
the
price
consider
the
price
helen
are
you
willing
to
pay
the
price
ernest
i
yes
but
it
the
woman
always
the
woman
who
pays
helen
i
am
willing

by
playing
the
shameless
tricks
of
the

do
everything
in

you
about

jean
about
what
john
nothing
i
thought
i
tell
you
rex
has
reformed
jean
you
thought

saint
you
never

unfair
to
train

only
for
this
what
chance
what
choice
have
i
to
live
on
the
bounty
of
a
disapproving
brother

i
envy

determined
look
on
his

what
it
means
to
be
an
old
maid

alone
looking
very
pretty
in
girlish
distress
rex
gazes
at
her
a
moment
and
then
with
sudden
passion
he
silently
rushes
over
seizes
her
in
his
arms
kisses
her
jean
struggles
frees
herself
and
rubs
her
ugh
how
could
you

held
you
in
his
arms
he
has
kissed
your

i
ever
tried
to
find
out
rex
ah

do
deny
it
you
ca
jean
i
can
respects

do
deserve
it
but
he
does
rex
thank
heavens
oh
you
do
know
how
this
has
tormented
me
little
jean
the
thought
of
any
other
man
coming
near
you
why
i
have
felt
the
same
toward
you
again
i
just
could
jean
her
lips
then
well
then
other
men
have
come
near
me
other
men
have
kissed
me
rex
rex
wild
what
when
where
jean
oh
in
conservatories
in
town
john
camp
in
the
north
woods
motor
rides
in
the
country
once
or
twice
out
here
on
this
very
terrace
when
i
felt
sentimental
in
the
moonlight
rex
oh
jean
i
never
supposed
were
that
sort
jean
oh
i
do
make
a
habit
of
it
i
not
sort
but
well
this
is
all
i
could
tell
you
about
myself
rex
rex
do
oh
what
do
you
mean
quick
jean
oh
i
merely
been
handled
not
hurt
slightly
but
as
good
as
new
rex
a
pause
jean
what
makes
you
say
such
horribly
honest
things
to
me
jean
yesterday
i
did
you
a
great
unkindness
rex
i
deserve
to
suffer
for
it
you
do
suppose
i
enjoy
talking
this
way
about
myself
rex
i
never
heard
a
girl
a
nice
girl
talk
like
this
before
jean
naturally
not
usually
nice
girls
hide
it
it
an
instinct
in
women
to
keep
up
their
value
often
i
had
thoughts
and
feelings
which
nice
girls
of
your
artificial
ideal
are
supposed
never
to
have
at
all
perfectly
natural
too
especially
girls
of
my
sort
we
have
so
little
to
occupy
our
minds
except
men
to
have
a
useful
absorbing
occupation
it
rubs
off
the
bloom
lowers
our
price
in
the
market
you
see
rex
oh
stop
if
you
not
going
to
marry
me
say
so
but
jean
but
i
am
i
am
not
going
to
be
a
dependent
old
maid
bewildered
only
gazes
at
but
first
i
want
you
to
know
exactly
what
you
getting
for
your
money
that
seems
only
businesslike
rex
would
you
only
marry
me
for
that
jean
i
told
you
i
loved
another
man
do
you
want
me
rex
jealousy
do
i
want
you
he
sha
have
you
comes
jean
then
take
me
rex
her
i
make
you
love
her
i
bring
a
different
light
into
those
cold
eyes
of
yours
wait
until
married
wait
until
you
awakened
i
make
you
forget
that
man
all
other
men
you
are
to
be
mine
all
mine
all
mine
this
embrace
jean
is
quite
passive
holds
up
her
cheek
to
be
kissed
and
when
he
seeks
her
lips
she
shuts
her
eyes
and
gives
him
her
lips
he
suddenly
stops
chilled
holding
her
at
arms
but
i
do
care

be
a
sacrilege
john
you
dare
threaten
me
after
all
i
done
for
you
theodore
your
five
thousand
was
a
loan
not
a
bribe
every
cent
of
it
will
be
returned
john
you
ca

it
i
would
let
you
if
you
could
come
it
all
in
the
family
shakes
his
you
know
that
beautiful
gothic
chapel
old
man
baker
is
building
on
his
estate
he
likes
you
i
tell
him
you
just
the
man
he
looking
for
safe
and
sane
no
socialistic
tendencies
theodore
do
trouble
yourself
he
offered
me
the
place
this
morning
john
you
did
refuse
it
theodore
i
did
this
morning
but
since
my
last
talk
with
you
i
reconsidered
i
telephoned
my
acceptance
john
bully
great
why
now
you
fixed
for
life
only
one
kind
of
fitness
encouraged
eh
right
always
triumphs
in
the
end
never
lose
your
faith
again
theodore
theodore
right
that
whited
sepulchre
his
mill
hands
dying
like
flies
his
private
life
a
public
scandal
john
a
cynical
then
why
accept
his
tainted
money
theodore
his
to
keep
my
wife
alive
to
keep
my
children
out
of
the
streets
to
keep
myself
out
of
deeper
debt
to
you
that
why
i
accept
it
that
why
many
a
man
sells
his
soul
to
the
devil
if
i
had
only
myself
to
consider
why
to
me
a
little
thing
like
death
would
be
a
blessed
luxury
but
i
why
john
i
can
not
afford
even
to
die
i
must
compromise
and
live
live
for
those
dependent
on
me
your
five
thousand
will
be
returned
with
interest
but
your
little
sister
will
not
be
married
to
a
man
she
does
not
want
john
but
rex
wants
and
money
talks
in
this
world
louder
than
the
church
refuse
to
marry
baker
son
and
how
long
will
you
keep
chapel
think
it
over
theodore
think
it
over

the
house
a
man
of
judge
wait
you

done
your
best
to
destroy
your
sister
but
you
utterly
failed
they
have
done
nothing
wrong
why
they
are
the
finest
truest
noblest
pair
of
lovers
i
ever
met
now
they
theodore
theodore
i
ca
say
that
i
call
helen
ideas
of
marriage
noble
exactly
judge
she
is
willing
to
sacrifice
even
marriage
for
his
career
is
that
noble
and
he
willing
to
sacrifice
even
his
career
for
marriage
both
noble
if
you
ask
me
john
noble
a
pair
of
highbrow
fools
they
do
have
to
sacrifice
anything
for
anybody
ca
they
work
together
just
as
well
married
as
unmarried
judge
that
what
i
said
to
her
but
you
had
already
convinced
her
that
it
was
impractical
work
and
marriage
combine
the
two
and
you
fail
at
both
your
own
warning
john
john
you
think
you
very
funny
do
you
but
that
my
sister
in
there
planning
to
be
that
fellow
mistress
right
here
in
my
own
house
anything
funny
about
that
judge
all
right
go
put
a
stop
to
it
then
starts
toward
your
own
house
turn
her
out
again
stops
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
john
has
no
drive
little
jean
into
marriage
with
a
man
she
does
not
love
she
is
an
girl
but
your
other
sister
you
ca
make
her
marry
even
the
man
she
does
love
unless
she
sees
fit
she
is
the
new
woman
society
can
no
longer
force
females
into
wedlock
so
it
is
forcing
them
out
by
the
thousands
approve
of
it
of
course
not
but
what
good
will
our
disapproval
do
they
will
only
laugh
at
you
the
strike
is
on
few
of
the
strikers
will
let
you
see
it
few
of
the
strikers
have
courage
but
believe
it
or
not
the
strike
will
spread
it
can
not
be
crushed
by
law
or
force
unless
society
wakes
up
and
reforms
its
rules
and
regulations
of
marriage
marriage
is
doomed
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
thought
so
nothing
call
them
bad
women
and
let
it
go
at
that
blame
it
all
on
human
nature
made
by
god
and
leave
untouched
our
human
institutions
made
by
man
you
poor
little
pessimists
human
nature
is
better
than
it
ever
was
but
our
most
important
institution
is
worse
the
most
sacred
relationship
in
life
has
become
a
jest
in
the
you
funny
little
cowards
afraid
of
life
afraid
of
love
afraid
of
truth
you
worship
lies
and
call
it
god
john
all
right
all
right
but
we
ca
change
marriage
overnight
just
to
suit
helen
what
are
going
to
do
about
it
judge
there
just
one
thing
to
do
will
you
back
me
up
in
everything
i
say
john
his
own
anything
everything
judge
then
tell
helen
she
does
have
to
marry
that
with
the
best
intentions
the
church
has
made
a
muddle
of
monogamy
illustration
a
photograph
by
white
judge
you
poor
little
pessimists
human
nature
is
better
than
it
ever
was
but
our
most
important
institution
is
worse
the
most
sacred
relationship
in
life
has
become
a
jest
in
the
theodore
uncle
everett
i
protest
judge
that
we
all
admire
their
consecrated
courage
and
advise
their
trying
this
conscientious
experiment
john

if
i
have
anything
to
say
about
it
judge

numerous
drawbacks
and
they

its
advantages
deny
it

a
bad
way
but

less
of
two
evils

theodore
the
morality
of
marriage
what
next
ernest
that
what
i
said
the
morality
of
this
woman
is
not
on
trial
before
you
marriage
is
on
trial
before
her
and
thus
far
bound
to
say
you
not
made
out
a
good
case
for
it
but
simply
her
marrying
me
and
i
give
you
my
word
you
can
perform
the
ceremony
this
very
evening
no
license
is
required
in
this
state
you
know
creates
a
judge
now
what
could
be
fairer
than
that
do
you
agree
to
this
helen
we
agree
in
everything
judge
helen
i
never
said
i
did
not
believe
in
a
legal
wedding
for
those
who
can
afford
the
luxury
of
children
but
for
those
who
have
to
take
it
out
in
working
for
other
people
children
all
their
lives
a
ceremony
seems
like
a
subterfuge
without
children
i
do
see
how
any
marriage
is
ever
consummated
socially
theodore
ah
but
this
relationship
it
a
sacred
thing
in
itself
helen
i
know
it
i
want
to
do
right
theodore
please
believe
that
i
do
but
the
kind
of
marriage
preached
by
the
church
and
practised
by
the
world
does
that
cherish
the
real
sacredness
of
this
relationship
of
course
i
can
only
judge
from
appearances
but
so
often
marriage
seems
to
destroy
the
sacredness
yes
and
also
the
usefulness
of
this
relationship
ernest
but
my
dear
girl
helen
he
thinks
so
too
only
he
has
a
quaint
mannish
notion
that
he
must
protect
me
ernest
patting
his
have
you
dear
she
has
raised
the
shield
of
judge
what
did
i
tell
you
theodore
the
old
marriage
does
fit
the
new
woman
a
girl
like
helen
objects
to
obeying
a
mere
man
like
ernest
helen
the
judge
arm
affectionately
uncle
everett
you
know
nothing
about
it
you
think
you
understand
the
new
generation
the
only
generation
you
understand
is
the
one
which
clamored
for
woman
rights
i
obey
you
already
every
day
of
my
life
do
i
not
dear
up
into
his
you
my
boss
are
you
ernest
but
i
do
object
to
contracting
by
law
for
what
is
better
done
by
love
judge
but
suppose
the
promise
to
obey
were
left
out
helen
but
the
contract
to
love
that
so
much
worse
it
seems
to
me
obedience
is
a
mere
matter
of
will
is
it
not
but
when
a
man
promises
to
love
until
death
theodore
are
you
so
cold
so
scientific
so
that
you
can
not
trust
the
man
you
love
helen
why
theodore
if
i
did
trust
him
i
him
contracts
are
not
for
those
who
trust
they
for
those
who
do
lucy
helen
now
i
may
be
helen
but
i
a
married
woman
and
i
know
men
you
never
can
tell
my
dear
you
never
can
tell
helen
do
you
think
i
live
with
a
man
who
did
not
love
me
do
you
think
live
a
man
i
did
not
love
why
what
kind
of
a
woman
should
i
be
then
the
name
wife
would
that
change
it
calling
it
holy
would
that
hallow
it
every
woman
married
or
not
knows
the
truth
about
this
in
her
soul
woman
has
always
known
but
until
has
never
dared
to
tell
ernest
oh
come
now
those
vows
they
are
intended
in
a
literal
sense
ask
theodore
why
no
sane
person
means
half
of
that
gibberish
with
all
my
worldly
goods
i
thee
endow
millions
of
men
have
said
it
how
many
ever
did
it
how
many
clergymen
ever
expect
them
to
it
all
a
polite
fiction
in
beautiful
sonorous
english
helen
the
most
sacred
relationship
in
life
ernest
shall
you
and
i
enter
it
unadvisedly
lightly
and
with
lies
on
our
lips
simply
because
others
do
ernest
little
but
the
whole
world
stands
for
this
and
the
world
wo
stand
for
that
helen
is
that
reverently
soberly
and
in
the
fear
of
god
no
cynically
selfishly
and
in
the
fear
of
man
i
do
want
to
be
obstinate
i
like
to
set
myself
up
as
holier
than
thou
but
ernest
unless
we
begin
honestly
we
end
dishonestly
somehow
marriage
seems
wicked
to
me
judge
how
do
you
like
that
theodore
john
is
right
they
gone
mad
ernest
all
the
same
you
got
to
marry
me
you
simply
to
helen
you
are
mistaken
i
do
have
to
marry
i
can
support
myself
ernest
then
i
disappointed
in
you
helen
and
i
in
you
ernest
i
thought
you
were
sensible
helen
i
thought
you
were
honest
ernest
honest
you
accuse
me
of
dishonesty
helen
you
do
believe
in
half
of
that
gibberish
yet
you
are
willing
to
work
the
church
for
our
own
worldly
advantage
you
are
willing
to
prostitute
the
most
sacred
thing
in
life
if
that
is
not
dishonest
what
is
ernest
and
you
are
the
woman
i
love
and
want
to
marry
in
all
my
life
i
was
never
accused
of
dishonesty
before
helen
you
never
tried
to
marry
before
no
one
is
honest
about
marriage
ernest
i
never
shall
try
again
i
going
to
paris
and
i
going
alone
helen
then

never
come
back

the
last
time

of
all
that

sweetest
noblest
and
best

the
tense
silence
a
shudder
ripples
the
family
rex
to
gee
they
had
a
scrap
too
john
nervously
ernest
still
if
i
may
interrupt
he
has
financial
reasons
i
respect
him
for
it
but
this
very
day
the
baker
institute
in
recognition
of
doctor
hamilton
distinguished
services
to
humanity
has
doubled
his
salary
doubled
it
it

all
right
rex
to
four
thousand
eh
get
a
very
decent
touring
car
for

very
kind
but
that
is
not
the
point
true
our
mutual
needs
are
such
that
we
can
not
live
nor
work
apart
but
our
convictions
are
such
that
we
can
not
live
and
work
in
what
you
have
the
humor
to
call
holy
wedlock
now
helen
the
motor
is
waiting
gasps
of
amazement
and
horror
some
jump
up
from
table
a
chair
is
upset
ernest
holds

general
movement
and
john
you
leave
this
house
only

my
dead
body

him
among
you
who
has
a
purer
ideal
of
love
a
higher
conception
of
duty
cast
the
first
stone
stop
theodore
but
this
man
and
this
woman
would
destroy
marriage
judge
beside
no
such
as
they
will
not
destroy
marriage
they
will
save
it
they
restore
the
vital
substance
while
we
preserve
the
empty
shell
everything
they
have
said
everything
they
have
done
proves
it
the
promise
to
love
they
could
not
help
it
they
took
it
i
heard
them
the
instinct
for
secrecy
they
felt
it
we
all
do
but
straightway
they
told
the
next
of
kin
to
even
when
insulted
and
driven
forth
from
the
tribe
they
indignantly
refused
to
be
driven
into
each
arms
until
you
of
the
same
blood
could
hear
them
plight
their
troth
believe
in
marriage
why
there
never
was
there
never
will
be
a
more
perfect
tribute
to
true
marriage
than
from
this
fearless
pair
you
now
accuse
of
seeking
to
destroy
it
tries
to
interrupt
but
the
judge
waves
him
they
have
been
not
only
honorable
but
save
in
the
one
orthodox
detail
of
accepting
the
authority
constituted
by
society
for
its
protection
and
for
helen
and
but
now
i
sure
before
starting
on
their
wedding
journey
another
convention
they
believe
in
that
just
to
please
us
if
not
themselves
they
will
consent
to
be
united
in
the
bonds
of
holy
wedlock
