the
blind
spot
opens
with
the
words
perhaps
it
were
just
as
well
to
start
at
the
beginning
a
mere
matter
of
suppose
i
use
them
in
the
same
sense
a
mere
matter
of
news
the
first
instalment
of
this
fabulous
novel
was
featured
in
for
may
described
as
a
different
serial
it
was
introduced
by
a
cover
by
modest
stein
in
the
foreground
was
the
profile
of
a
girl
of
another
dimension
ethereal
sensuous
the
eternal
feminine
the
nervina
of
the
story
filmy
crystalline
earrings
swept
back
over
her
bare
shoulders
dominating
the
background
was
a
huge
flaming
yellow
ball
like
our
sun
as
seen
from
the
hypothetical
vulcan
splotched
with
murky
mysterious
globii
vitonae
there
was
an
ancient
quay
and
emerging
from
the
ultramarine
waters
about
it
a
silhouetted
metropolis
of
spires
domes
and
minarets
it
was
and
that
generation
thus
received
its
first
glimpse
of
the
alien
landscape
of
the
blind
spot
and
the
baroque
beauty
of
an
immortal
woman
of
fantasy
fiction
the
authors
homer
eon
flint
was
already
a
reigning
favourite
with
enthusiasts
of
imaginative
literature
who
had
eagerly
devoured
his
queen
of
life
and
lord
of
death
his
king
of
conserve
island
and
the
planeteer
austin
hall
was
well
known
and
popular
for
his
almost
immortal
rebel
soul
and
into
the
infinite
then
came
this
collaboration
when
mary
gnaedinger
launched
famous
fantastic
mysteries
magazine
she
early
presented
the
blind
spot
and
printed
it
again
in
that
magazine
companion
fantastic
novels
these
reprints
are
now
collectors
items
almost
unobtainable
and
otherwise
the
story
has
long
been
out
of
print
rumour
says
an
unauthorised
german
version
of
the
blind
spot
has
been
published
in
book
form
there
is
another
book
called
the
blind
spot
and
also
a
magazine
story
and
a
major
movie
studio
was
to
produce
a
film
of
the
same
title
however
here
is
presented
the
only
version
of
the
only
blind
spot
of
consequence
to
lovers
of
fantasy
who
wrote
the
story
when
i
first
looked
into
the
question
as
a
year
old
boy
homer
eon
flint
he
originally
spelled
his
name
with
a
d
was
already
dead
of
a
fall
into
a
canyon
in
his
widow
told
me
i
think
homer
father
contributed
that
middle
name
the
same
name
with
slightly
different
spelling
that
the
irish
poet
george
russell
took
as
his
which
became
known
by
its
abbreviation
ae
flindt
said
of
flint
father
he
was
a
very
deep
thinker
and
enjoyed
reading
heavy
like
father
like
son
homer
always
talked
over
his
ideas
with
me
and
although
i
could
always
follow
his
thoughts
it
seemed
to
help
him
to
express
them
to
another
it
made
some
things
come
more
clearly
to
flint
was
a
great
admirer
of
wells
this
little
told
me
and
had
probably
read
all
his
works
up
to
the
time
when
he
flint
died
in
he
had
read
doyle
and
haggard
but
wells
was
his
favourite
the
real
flint
found
a
in
austin
hall
whom
he
met
in
san
jose
california
while
working
at
a
shop
where
shoes
were
repaired
electrically
a
rather
new
concept
at
the
hall
learning
that
flint
lived
in
the
same
city
sought
him
out
and
they
became
fast
friends
each
stimulated
the
other
as
hall
told
me
twenty
years
ago
of
the
origin
of
the
blind
spot
one
day
after
we
had
lunched
together
i
held
my
finger
up
in
front
of
one
of
my
eyes
and
said
could
a
story
be
written
about
that
blind
spot
in
the
eye
not
much
was
said
about
it
at
the
time
but
four
days
later
again
at
lunch
i
outlined
the
whole
story
to
him
i
wrote
the
first
eighteen
chapters
homer
took
up
the
tale
as
and
wrote
the
chapters
about
the
house
of
miracles
the
living
death
the
rousing
of
aradna
mind
and
so
forth
up
to
man
from
space
where
once
again
i
took
to
the
blind
spot
hall
contributed
a
great
knowledge
of
history
and
anthropology
while
flint
fortes
were
physics
and
medicine
both
had
a
great
fund
of
philosophy
at
their
command
when
i
met
hall
about
four
years
older
than
flint
he
was
in
his
fifties
a
old
codger
old
to
a
that
is
full
of
good
humour
and
indulgence
for
a
youthful
admirer
who
had
journeyed
far
to
meet
him
he
casually
referred
to
his
published
stories
and
i
carried
away
the
impression
of
one
who
resembled
both
in
output
and
in
looks
that
other
of
the
time
edgar
wallace
finally
several
years
ago
before
i
knew
anything
about
the
present
volume
i
had
an
unusual
experience
at
that
time
i
had
no
reason
to
think
the
blind
spot
would
ever
become
available
as
a
book
for
the
location
of
the
heirs
proved
a
herculean
task
by
itself
publishers
had
long
wanted
to
present
this
amazing
novel
but
could
not
do
so
until
i
located
mae
hall
and
mabel
flindt
while
unfortunately
i
did
not
take
careful
notes
at
the
time
the
gist
of
the
occurrence
was
this
i
visited
a
friend
whose
hobby
besides
reading
fantasy
was
the
occult
who
volunteered
to
entertain
me
with
automatic
writing
and
the
now
i
share
lovecraft
scepticism
towards
the
supernatural
regarding
it
as
at
best
a
means
of
amusement
when
the
question
arose
of
what
spirits
we
should
try
to
lure
to
our
planchette
the
names
of
lovecraft
merritt
hall
and
flint
popped
into
my
pixilated
mind
so
i
set
my
fingers
on
the
wooden
heart
and
since
my
host
was
also
a
flint
admirer
we
asked
about
flint
fatal
accident
the
ouija
spelled
out
there
followed
something
about
being
held
up
by
a
then
hall
or
at
least
some
other
than
my
own
conscious
mind
came
through
too
and
when
i
asked
if
he
had
left
any
work
behind
he
replied
later
i
asked
his
son
about
this
without
revealing
the
title
and
javen
hall
told
me
of
the
story
his
father
had
been
plotting
when
he
died
the
hidden
empire
or
the
child
of
the
southwind
whatever
was
pushing
the
planchette
failed
to
inform
me
that
when
i
found
austin
hall
son
and
widow
they
would
put
into
my
hands
an
unknown
unpublished
fantasy
novel
by
hall
the
house
of
dawn
some
day
it
may
appear
in
print
meanwhile
you
are
getting
understandably
impatient
to
explore
that
unknown
realm
of
the
blind
spot

your
way

beverley

prologue
perhaps
it
were
just
as
well
to
start
at
the
beginning
a
mere
matter
of
news
all
the
world
at
the
time
knew
the
story
but
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
forgotten
i
shall
repeat
it
i
am
merely
giving
it
as
i
have
taken
it
from
the
papers
with
no
elaboration
and
no
opinion
a
mere
statement
of
facts
it
was
a
celebrated
case
at
the
time
and
stirred
the
world
to
wonder
indeed
it
still
is
celebrated
though
to
the
layman
it
is
forgotten
it
has
been
labelled
and
indexed
and
filed
away
in
the
archives
of
the
profession
to
those
who
wish
to
look
it
up
it
will
be
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
great
unsolved
mysteries
of
the
century
a
crime
that
leads
two
ways
one
into
murder
sordid
cold
and
calculating
and
the
other
into
the
nebulous
screen
that
thwarts
us
from
the
occult
perhaps
it
is
the
character
of
holcomb
that
gives
the
latter
he
was
a
great
man
and
a
splendid
thinker
that
he
should
have
been
led
into
a
maze
of
cheap
necromancy
is
on
the
face
improbable
he
had
a
wonderful
mind
for
years
he
had
been
battering
down
the
scepticism
that
had
bulwarked
itself
in
the
material
he
was
a
psychologist
and
up
to
the
day
the
greatest
perhaps
that
we
have
known
he
had
a
way
of
going
out
before
his
fellows
it
is
the
way
of
genius
and
he
had
gone
far
indeed
before
them
if
we
would
trust
holcomb
we
have
much
to
live
for
our
religion
is
not
all
hearsay
and
there
is
a
great
deal
in
science
still
unthought
of
it
is
an
unfortunate
case
but
there
is
much
to
be
learned
in
the
circumstance
that
led
the
great
doctor
into
the
blind
spot
i
rhamda
avec
on
a
certain
foggy
morning
in
september
a
tall
man
wearing
a
black
overcoat
and
bearing
in
one
hand
a
small
satchel
of
leather
descended
from
a
geary
street
tram
at
the
foot
of
market
street
san
francisco
it
was
a
damp
morning
a
mist
was
brooding
over
the
city
blurring
all
distinctness
the
man
glanced
about
him
a
tall
man
of
trim
lines
and
distinctness
and
a
quick
decided
step
and
bearing
in
the
shuffle
of
descending
passengers
he
was
outstanding
with
a
certain
inborn
grace
that
without
the
blood
will
never
come
from
training
men
noticed
and
women
out
of
instinct
cast
curious
furtive
glances
and
then
turned
away
which
was
natural
inasmuch
as
the
man
was
plainly
old
but
for
all
that
many
ventured
a
second
glance
and
wondered
an
old
man
with
the
poise
of
twenty
a
strange
face
of
remarkable
features
swarthy
of
an
eastern
cast
perhaps
indian
whatever
the
certainty
of
the
man
age
there
was
still
a
lingering
suggestion
of
splendid
youth
if
one
persisted
in
a
third
or
fourth
look
this
suggestion
took
an
almost
certain
tone
the
man
age
dwindled
years
dropped
from
him
and
the
quizzical
smile
that
played
on
the
lips
seemed
a
foreboding
of
boyish
laughter
we
say
foreboding
because
in
this
case
it
is
not
mistaken
diction
foreboding
suggests
coming
evil
the
laughter
of
boys
is
wholehearted
it
was
merely
that
things
were
not
exactly
as
they
should
be
it
was
not
natural
that
age
should
be
so
youthful
the
fates
were
playing
and
in
this
case
for
once
in
the
world
history
their
play
was
crosswise
it
is
a
remarkable
case
from
the
beginning
and
we
are
starting
from
facts
the
man
crossed
to
the
window
of
the
key
route
ferry
and
purchased
a
ticket
for
berkeley
after
which
with
the
throng
he
passed
the
turnstile
and
on
to
the
boat
that
was
waiting
he
took
the
lower
deck
not
from
choice
apparently
but
more
because
the
majority
of
his
fellow
passengers
being
men
were
bound
in
this
direction
the
same
chance
brought
him
to
the
the
men
about
him
purchased
cigars
and
cigarettes
and
as
is
the
habit
of
all
smokers
strolled
off
with
delighted
relish
the
man
watched
them
had
anyone
noticed
his
eyes
he
would
have
noted
a
peculiar
colour
and
a
light
of
surprise
with
the
prim
step
that
made
him
so
distinctive
he
advanced
to
the
pardon
me
but
i
would
like
to
purchase
one
of
though
he
spoke
perfect
english
it
was
in
a
strange
manner
after
the
fashion
of
one
who
has
found
something
that
he
has
just
learned
how
to
use
at
the
same
time
he
made
a
suggestion
with
his
tapered
fingers
indicating
the
tobacco
in
the
case
the
clerk
looked
up
a
cigar
sir
yes
sir
what
will
it
be
a
cigar
again
the
strange
articulation
ah
yes
that
is
it
now
i
remember
and
it
has
a
little
sister
the
cigarette
i
think
i
shall
take
a
cigarette
if
if
if
you
will
show
me
how
to
use
it
was
a
strange
request
the
clerk
was
accustomed
to
all
manner
of
men
and
their
brands
of
humour
he
was
about
to
answer
in
kind
when
he
looked
up
and
into
the
man
eyes
he
started
you
mean
he
asked
that
you
have
never
seen
a
cigar
or
cigarette
that
you
do
not
know
how
to
use
them
a
man
as
old
as
you
the
stranger
laughed
it
was
rather
resentful
but
for
all
that
of
a
hearty
taint
of
humour
so
old
would
you
say
that
i
am
as
old
as
that
if
you
will
look
again
the
young
man
did
and
what
he
beheld
is
something
that
he
could
not
quite
account
for
the
strange
conviction
of
this
remarkable
man
of
age
melting
into
youth
of
an
uncertain
freshness
the
smile
not
of
sixty
but
of
twenty
the
young
man
was
not
one
to
argue
whatever
his
wonder
he
was
first
of
all
a
lad
of
business
he
could
merely
acquiesce
the
first
time
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
ever
seen
a
cigar
or
cigarette
the
stranger
nodded
the
first
time
i
have
never
beheld
one
of
them
before
this
morning
if
you
will
allow
me
he
indicated
a
package
i
think
i
shall
take
one
of
the
clerk
took
up
the
package
opened
the
end
and
shook
out
a
single
cigarette
the
man
lit
it
and
as
the
smoke
poured
out
of
his
mouth
held
the
cigarette
tentatively
in
his
fingers
like
it
it
was
the
clerk
who
asked
the
other
did
not
answer
his
whole
face
was
the
expression
of
having
just
discovered
one
of
the
senses
he
was
a
splendid
man
and
if
the
word
may
be
employed
of
the
sterner
sex
one
of
beauty
his
features
were
even
that
is
to
be
noted
his
nose
chiselled
straight
and
to
perfection
the
eyes
of
a
peculiar
sombreness
and
lustre
almost
burning
of
a
black
of
such
intensity
as
to
verge
into
red
and
to
be
devoid
of
pupils
and
yet
for
all
of
that
of
a
glow
and
softness
after
a
moment
he
turned
to
the
clerk
you
are
young
my
you
are
fortunate
you
live
in
a
wonderful
age
it
is
as
wonderful
as
your
tobacco
and
you
still
have
many
great
things
before
yes
the
man
walked
on
to
the
forward
part
of
the
boat
leaving
the
youth
who
had
been
in
a
sort
of
daze
watching
but
it
was
not
for
long
the
whole
thing
had
been
strange
and
to
the
lad
almost
inexplicable
the
man
was
not
insane
he
was
certain
and
he
was
just
as
sure
that
he
had
not
been
joking
from
the
start
he
had
been
taken
by
the
man
refinement
intellect
and
education
he
was
positive
that
he
had
been
sincere
yet
the
ferry
detective
happened
at
that
moment
to
be
passing
the
clerk
made
an
indication
with
his
thumb
that
man
yonder
he
spoke
the
one
in
black
watch
then
he
told
his
story
the
detective
laughed
and
walked
forward
it
was
a
most
fortunate
incident
it
was
a
strange
case
that
mere
act
of
the
cigar
clerk
placed
the
police
on
the
track
and
gave
to
the
world
the
only
clue
that
it
holds
of
the
blind
spot
the
detective
had
laughed
at
the
lad
recital
almost
any
one
had
a
patent
for
being
queer
and
if
this
gentleman
had
a
whim
for
a
certain
brand
of
humour
that
was
his
business
nevertheless
he
would
stroll
forward
the
man
was
not
hard
to
distinguish
he
was
standing
on
the
forward
deck
facing
the
wind
and
peering
through
the
mist
at
the
grey
heavy
heave
of
the
water
alongside
of
them
the
dim
shadow
of
a
sister
ferry
screamed
its
way
through
the
fogbank
that
he
was
a
landsman
was
evidenced
by
his
way
of
standing
he
was
uncertain
at
every
heave
of
the
boat
he
would
shift
sidewise
an
unusually
heavy
roll
caught
him
slightly
and
jostled
him
against
the
detective
the
latter
held
up
his
hand
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
a
bad
morning
spoke
the
officer
did
you
notice
the
yerbe
buena
yonder
she
just
grazed
us
a
bad
the
stranger
turned
as
the
detective
caught
the
splendid
face
the
glowing
eyes
and
the
youthful
smile
he
started
much
as
had
done
the
cigar
clerk
the
same
effect
of
the
age
melting
into
youth
and
the
officer
being
much
more
accustomed
to
reading
men
a
queer
sense
of
latent
and
potent
vision
the
eyes
were
soft
and
receptive
but
for
all
that
of
the
delicate
strength
and
colour
that
comes
from
abnormal
intellect
he
noted
the
pupils
black
glowing
of
great
size
almost
filling
the
iris
and
the
whole
melting
into
intensity
that
verged
into
red
either
the
man
had
been
long
without
sleep
or
he
was
one
of
unusual
intelligence
and
vitality
a
nasty
morning
repeated
the
officer
ah
er
yes
did
you
say
it
was
a
nasty
morning
indeed
i
do
not
know
sir
however
it
is
very
stranger
in
san
francisco
well
yes
at
least
i
have
never
seen
the
detective
was
a
bit
nonplussed
by
the
man
evident
evasion
well
if
you
are
a
stranger
i
suppose
it
is
up
to
me
to
come
to
the
defence
of
my
city
this
is
one
of
frisco
fogs
we
have
them
occasionally
sometimes
they
last
for
days
this
one
is
a
low
one
it
will
lift
presently
then
you
will
see
the
sun
have
you
ever
seen
frisco
sun
my
dear
sir
this
same
slow
articulation
i
have
never
seen
your
sun
nor
any
hum
it
was
an
answer
altogether
unexpected
again
the
officer
found
himself
gazing
into
the
strange
refined
face
and
wonderful
eyes
the
man
was
not
blind
of
that
he
was
certain
neither
was
his
voice
harsh
or
testy
rather
was
it
soft
and
polite
of
one
merely
stating
a
fact
yet
how
could
it
be
he
remembered
the
cigar
clerk
neither
cigar
nor
sun
from
what
manner
of
land
could
the
man
come
a
detective
has
a
certain
gift
of
intuition
though
on
the
face
of
it
outside
of
the
personality
there
could
be
nothing
to
it
but
a
joke
he
chose
to
act
upon
the
impulse
he
pulled
back
the
door
which
had
been
closed
behind
them
and
the
boat
when
he
returned
the
boat
had
arrived
at
the
pier
you
are
going
to
oakland
it
was
a
chance
question
no
to
berkeley
i
take
a
train
here
i
understand
do
all
the
trains
go
to
berkeley
by
no
means
i
am
going
to
berkeley
myself
we
can
ride
together
my
name
is
jerome
albert
thanks
mine
is
avec
rhamda
avec
i
am
much
obliged
your
company
may
be
he
did
not
say
more
but
watched
with
unrestrained
interest
their
manoeuvre
into
the
slip
a
moment
later
they
were
marching
with
the
others
down
the
gangways
to
the
trains
waiting
just
as
they
were
seated
and
the
electric
train
was
pulling
out
of
the
pier
the
sun
breaking
through
the
mist
blazed
with
splendid
light
through
the
cloud
rifts
the
stranger
was
next
to
the
window
where
he
could
look
out
over
the
water
and
beyond
at
the
citied
shoreline
whose
sea
of
housetops
extended
and
rose
to
the
peaks
of
the
first
foothills
the
sun
was
just
coming
over
the
mountains
the
detective
watched
there
was
sincerity
in
the
man
actions
it
was
not
acting
when
the
light
first
broke
he
turned
his
eyes
full
into
the
radiance
it
was
the
act
of
a
child
and
so
it
struck
the
officer
of
the
same
trust
and
simplicity
and
likewise
the
same
effect
he
drew
away
quickly
for
the
moment
blinded
ah
he
said
it
is
so
this
is
the
sun
your
sun
is
wonderful
indeed
it
is
returned
the
other
but
rather
common
we
see
it
every
day
it
the
whole
works
but
we
get
used
to
it
for
myself
i
can
not
see
anything
strange
in
the
still
shining
you
have
been
blind
avec
pardon
the
question
but
i
must
naturally
infer
you
say
you
have
never
seen
the
sun
i
suppose
he
stopped
because
of
the
other
smile
somehow
it
seemed
a
very
superior
one
as
if
predicting
a
wealth
of
wisdom
my
dear
jerome
he
spoke
i
have
never
been
blind
in
my
life
i
say
it
is
wonderful
it
is
glorious
and
past
describing
so
is
it
all
your
water
your
boats
your
ocean
but
i
see
there
is
one
thing
even
stranger
still
it
is
yourselves
with
all
your
greatness
you
are
only
part
of
your
surroundings
do
you
know
what
is
your
sun
search
me
returned
the
officer
i
no
astronomer
i
understand
they
do
know
themselves
fire
i
suppose
and
a
hell
of
a
hot
one
but
there
is
one
thing
that
i
can
and
this
is
the
if
he
meant
it
for
insinuation
it
was
ineffective
the
other
smiled
kindly
in
the
fine
effect
of
the
delicate
features
and
most
of
all
in
the
eyes
was
sincerity
in
that
face
was
the
mark
of
genius
he
felt
it
and
of
a
potent
superior
intelligence
most
of
all
did
he
note
the
beauty
and
the
soft
silky
superlustre
of
the
eyes
we
have
the
whole
thing
from
jerome
at
least
this
part
of
it
and
our
interest
being
retrospect
is
multiplied
far
above
that
of
the
detective
the
stranger
had
a
certain
call
of
character
and
of
appearance
not
to
say
magnetism
the
officer
felt
himself
almost
believing
and
yet
restraining
himself
into
caution
of
unbelief
it
was
a
remark
preposterous
on
the
face
of
it
what
puzzled
jerome
was
the
purpose
he
could
think
of
nothing
that
would
necessitate
such
statements
and
acting
he
was
certain
that
the
man
was
sane
in
the
light
of
what
came
after
great
stress
has
been
laid
by
a
certain
class
upon
this
incident
we
may
say
that
we
lean
neither
way
we
have
merely
given
it
in
some
detail
because
of
that
importance
we
have
yet
no
proof
of
the
mystic
and
until
it
is
proved
we
must
lean
like
jerome
upon
the
cold
material
we
have
the
mystery
but
even
at
that
we
have
not
the
certainty
of
murder
understand
it
was
intuition
that
led
jerome
into
that
memorable
trip
to
berkeley
he
happened
to
be
going
off
duty
and
was
drawn
to
the
man
by
a
chance
incident
and
the
fact
of
his
personality
at
this
minute
however
he
thought
no
more
of
him
than
as
an
eccentric
as
some
refined
strange
wonderful
gentleman
with
a
whim
for
his
own
brand
of
humour
only
that
could
explain
it
the
man
had
an
evident
curiosity
for
everything
about
him
the
buildings
the
street
the
cars
and
the
people
frequently
he
would
mutter
wonderful
wonderful
and
all
the
time
we
have
never
known
it
wonderful
as
they
drew
into
lorin
the
officer
ventured
a
question
you
have
friends
in
berkeley
i
see
you
are
a
stranger
if
i
may
presume
perhaps
i
may
be
of
assistance
well
yes
if
if
do
you
know
of
a
holcomb
you
mean
the
professor
he
lives
on
dwight
way
at
this
time
of
the
day
you
would
be
more
apt
to
find
him
at
the
university
is
he
expecting
you
it
was
a
blunt
question
and
of
course
none
of
his
business
yet
just
what
another
does
not
want
him
to
know
is
ever
the
pursuit
of
a
detective
at
the
same
time
the
subconscious
flashing
and
wondering
at
the
name
rhamda
avec
surely
neither
teutonic
nor
sanskrit
nor
anything
between
expecting
me
ah
yes
pardon
me
if
i
speak
slowly
i
am
not
quite
used
to
speech
yet
i
see
you
are
interested
after
i
see
holcomb
i
may
tell
you
however
it
is
very
urgent
that
i
see
the
doctor
he
well
i
may
say
that
we
have
known
each
other
a
long
then
you
know
him
yes
in
a
way
though
we
have
never
met
he
must
be
a
great
man
we
have
much
in
common
your
doctor
and
i
and
we
have
a
great
deal
to
give
to
your
world
however
i
would
not
recognise
him
should
i
see
him
would
you
by
any
chance
you
mean
would
i
be
your
guide
with
pleasure
it
just
happens
that
i
am
on
friendly
terms
with
your
friend
ii
the
professor
of
philosophy
and
now
to
start
in
on
another
angle
there
is
hardly
any
necessity
for
introducing
holcomb
all
of
us
at
least
those
who
read
and
most
of
all
those
of
us
who
are
interested
in
any
manner
of
speculation
knew
him
quite
well
he
was
the
professor
of
philosophy
at
the
university
of
california
a
great
man
and
a
good
one
one
of
those
fine
academic
souls
who
not
only
by
their
wisdom
but
by
their
character
have
a
way
of
stamping
themselves
upon
generations
a
speaker
of
the
upstanding
class
walking
on
his
own
feet
and
utterly
fearless
when
it
came
to
dashing
out
on
some
startling
philosophy
that
had
not
been
borne
up
by
his
forebears
he
was
original
he
believed
that
the
philosophies
of
the
ages
are
but
stepping
stones
that
the
wisdom
of
the
earth
looked
but
to
the
future
and
that
the
study
of
the
classics
however
essential
is
but
the
ground
work
for
combining
and
working
out
the
problems
of
the
future
he
was
epigrammatic
terse
and
gifted
with
a
quaint
humour
with
which
he
was
apt
even
when
in
the
driest
philosophy
to
drive
in
and
clinch
his
argument
best
of
all
he
was
able
to
clothe
the
most
abstract
thoughts
in
language
so
simple
and
concrete
that
he
brought
the
deepest
of
all
subjects
down
to
the
scope
of
the
commonest
thinker
it
is
needless
to
say
that
he
was
the
papers
about
the
bay
were
ever
and
anon
running
some
startling
story
of
the
professor
had
they
stuck
to
the
text
it
would
all
have
been
well
but
a
reporter
is
a
reporter
in
spite
of
the
editors
there
were
numerous
little
elaborations
to
pervert
the
context
a
great
man
must
be
careful
of
his
speech
holcomb
was
often
busy
refuting
he
could
not
understand
the
need
of
these
little
twistings
of
wisdom
it
kept
him
in
controversy
the
brothers
of
his
profession
often
took
him
to
task
for
these
little
distorted
scraps
of
philosophy
he
did
not
like
journalism
he
had
a
way
of
consigning
all
writers
and
editors
to
the
devil
which
was
vastly
amusing
to
the
reporters
once
they
had
him
going
they
poised
their
pens
in
glee
and
began
splashing
their
venomous
ink
it
was
tragic
the
great
professor
standing
at
bay
to
his
tormentors
one
and
all
they
loved
him
and
one
and
all
they
took
delight
in
his
torture
it
was
a
hard
task
for
a
reporter
to
get
in
at
a
lecture
and
yet
it
was
often
the
lot
of
the
professor
to
find
himself
and
his
words
featured
in
his
breakfast
paper
on
the
very
day
before
this
the
doctor
had
come
out
with
one
of
his
terse
startling
statements
he
had
a
way
of
inserting
parenthetically
some
of
his
scraps
of
wisdom
it
was
in
an
ethics
class
we
quote
his
words
as
near
as
possible
man
let
me
tell
you
is
egotistic
all
our
philosophy
is
based
on
ego
we
live
threescore
years
and
we
balance
it
with
all
eternity
we
are
it
did
you
ever
stop
and
think
of
eternity
it
is
a
rather
long
time
what
right
have
we
to
say
that
life
which
we
assume
to
be
everlasting
immediately
becomes
restrospect
once
it
passes
out
of
the
conscious
individuality
which
is
allotted
upon
this
earth
the
trouble
is
ourselves
we
are
we
weigh
everything
we
so
measure
eternity
until
we
step
out
into
other
senses
which
undoubtedly
exist
we
shall
never
arrive
at
the
conception
of
infinity
now
i
am
going
to
make
a
rather
startling
announcement
the
past
few
years
have
promised
a
culmination
which
has
been
guessed
at
and
yearned
for
since
the
beginning
of
time
it
is
within
and
still
without
the
scope
of
metaphysics
those
of
you
who
have
attended
my
lectures
have
heard
me
call
myself
the
material
idealist
i
am
a
mystic
sensationalist
i
believe
that
we
can
derive
nothing
from
pure
contemplation
there
is
mystery
and
wonder
in
the
veil
of
the
occult
the
earth
our
life
is
merely
a
vestibule
of
the
universe
contemplation
alone
will
hold
us
all
as
inapt
and
as
impotent
as
the
old
monks
of
athos
we
have
mountains
of
literature
behind
us
all
contemplative
and
whatever
its
wisdom
it
has
given
us
not
one
thing
outside
the
abstract
from
plato
down
to
the
present
our
philosophy
has
given
us
not
one
tangible
proof
not
one
concrete
fact
which
we
can
place
our
hands
on
we
are
virtually
where
we
were
originally
and
we
can
talk
talk
talk
from
now
until
the
clap
of
doomsday
what
then
my
friends
philosophy
must
take
a
step
sidewise
in
this
modern
age
young
science
practical
science
has
grown
up
and
far
surpassed
us
we
must
go
back
to
the
beginning
forget
our
subjective
musings
and
enter
the
concrete
we
are
and
in
the
nature
of
things
we
must
bring
the
proof
down
into
the
concrete
where
we
can
understand
it
can
we
pierce
the
nebulous
screen
that
shuts
us
out
of
the
occult
we
have
doubted
laughed
at
ourselves
and
been
laughed
at
but
the
fact
remains
that
always
we
have
persisted
in
the
believing
i
have
said
that
we
shall
never
never
understand
infinity
while
within
the
limitations
of
our
five
senses
i
repeat
it
but
that
does
not
imply
that
we
shall
never
solve
some
of
the
mystery
of
life
the
occult
is
not
only
a
supposition
but
a
fact
we
have
peopled
it
with
terror
because
like
our
forebears
before
columbus
we
have
peopled
it
with
imagination
and
now
to
my
statement
i
have
called
myself
the
material
idealist
i
have
adopted
an
entirely
new
trend
of
philosophy
during
the
past
years
unknown
to
you
and
unknown
to
my
friends
i
have
allied
myself
with
practical
science
i
desired
something
concrete
while
my
colleagues
and
others
were
pounding
out
tomes
of
wonderful
sophistry
i
have
been
pounding
away
at
the
screen
of
the
occult
this
is
a
proud
moment
i
have
succeeded
tomorrow
i
shall
bring
to
you
the
fact
and
the
substance
i
have
lifted
up
the
curtain
and
flooded
it
with
the
light
of
day
you
shall
have
the
fact
for
your
senses
tomorrow
i
shall
explain
it
all
i
shall
deliver
my
greatest
lecture
in
which
my
whole
me
has
come
to
a
focus
it
is
not
spiritualism
nor
sophistry
it
is
concrete
fact
and
common
sense
the
subject
of
my
lecture
tomorrow
will
be
blind
spot
here
begins
the
second
part
of
the
mystery
we
know
now
that
the
great
lecture
was
never
delivered
immediately
the
news
was
scattered
out
of
the
it
became
common
property
it
was
spread
over
the
country
and
was
featured
in
all
the
great
metropolitan
dailies
in
the
next
morning
seats
were
at
a
premium
students
professors
instructors
and
all
the
prominent
people
who
could
gain
admission
crowded
into
the
hall
even
the
irrepressible
reporters
had
stolen
in
to
take
down
the
greatest
scoop
of
the
century
the
place
was
jammed
until
even
standing
room
was
unthought
of
the
crowd
dense
and
packed
and
physically
uncomfortable
waited
the
minutes
dragged
by
it
was
a
long
long
wait
but
at
last
the
bell
rang
that
ticked
the
hour
every
one
was
expectant
and
then
fifteen
minutes
passed
by
twenty
the
crowd
settled
down
to
waiting
at
length
one
of
the
colleagues
stepped
into
the
doctor
office
and
telephoned
to
his
home
his
daughter
answered
father
why
he
left
over
two
hours
about
what
time
why
it
was
about
you
know
he
was
to
deliver
his
lecture
today
on
the
blind
spot
i
wanted
to
hear
it
but
he
told
me
i
could
have
it
at
home
he
said
he
was
to
have
a
wonderful
guest
and
i
must
make
ready
to
receive
him
is
father
there
not
yet
who
was
this
guest
did
he
say
oh
yes
in
a
way
a
most
wonderful
man
and
he
gave
him
a
wonderful
name
rhamda
avec
i
remember
because
it
is
so
funny
i
asked
father
if
he
was
sanskrit
and
he
said
he
was
much
older
than
that
just
imagine
did
your
father
have
his
lecture
with
him
oh
yes
he
glanced
over
it
at
breakfast
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
startle
the
world
as
it
had
never
been
since
the
day
of
yes
and
he
was
terribly
impatient
he
said
he
had
to
be
at
the
college
before
eight
to
receive
the
great
man
he
was
to
deliver
his
lecture
at
ten
and
afterward
he
would
have
lunch
at
noon
and
he
would
give
me
the
whole
story
i
all
thank
then
he
came
back
and
made
the
announcement
that
there
was
a
little
delay
but
that
holcomb
would
be
there
shortly
but
he
was
not
at
twelve
there
were
still
some
people
waiting
at
one
the
last
man
had
slipped
out
of
the
room
and
wondered
in
all
the
country
there
was
but
one
person
who
knew
that
one
was
an
obscure
man
who
had
yielded
to
a
detective
intuition
and
had
fallen
inadvertently
upon
one
of
the
greatest
mysteries
of
modern
times
iii
now
there
are
two
the
rest
of
the
story
is
unfortunately
all
too
easily
told
we
go
back
to
jerome
and
his
strange
companion
at
centre
street
station
they
alighted
and
walked
up
to
the
university
under
the
le
conte
oaks
they
met
the
professor
he
was
trim
and
happy
his
short
figure
clothed
in
black
his
whiskers
trimmed
to
the
usual
square
crop
and
his
pink
skin
glowing
with
splendid
health
the
fog
had
by
this
time
lifted
and
the
sun
was
just
beginning
to
overcome
the
chilliness
of
the
air
there
was
no
necessity
for
an
introduction
the
two
men
apparently
recognised
each
other
at
once
so
we
have
it
from
the
detective
there
was
sincerity
in
the
delight
of
their
a
strange
pair
both
of
them
with
the
distinction
and
poise
that
come
from
refinement
and
intellectual
training
though
in
physique
they
were
almost
opposite
there
was
still
a
strange
almost
mutual
bond
between
them
holcomb
was
beaming
at
last
he
greeted
at
last
i
was
sure
we
could
not
fail
this
my
dear
avec
is
the
greatest
day
since
the
other
took
the
hand
so
this
is
the
great
holcomb
yes
indeed
it
is
a
great
day
though
i
know
nothing
about
your
columbus
so
far
it
has
been
simply
wonderful
i
can
scarcely
credit
my
senses
so
near
and
yet
so
far
how
can
it
be
a
dream
are
you
sure
holcomb
my
dear
rhamda
i
am
sure
that
i
am
the
happiest
man
that
ever
lived
it
is
the
culmination
i
was
certain
we
could
not
fail
though
of
course
to
me
also
it
is
an
almost
impossible
climax
of
fact
i
should
never
have
succeeded
without
your
the
other
smiled
that
was
of
small
account
my
dear
doctor
to
yourself
must
go
the
credit
to
me
the
pleasure
take
your
sun
for
instance
i
but
i
have
not
the
language
to
tell
but
the
doctor
had
gone
in
to
abstraction
a
great
day
he
was
beaming
a
great
day
what
will
the
world
say
it
is
then
suddenly
you
have
eaten
not
yet
you
must
allow
me
a
bit
of
time
i
thought
of
it
but
i
had
not
quite
the
courage
to
then
we
shall
eat
said
the
other
man
afterward
we
shall
go
up
to
the
today
i
shall
deliver
my
lecture
on
the
blind
spot
and
when
i
am
through
you
shall
deliver
the
words
that
will
astonish
the
but
here
it
seems
there
was
a
hitch
the
other
shook
his
head
kindly
it
was
evident
that
while
the
doctor
was
the
leader
the
other
was
a
who
must
be
considered
i
am
afraid
professor
that
you
have
promised
a
bit
too
much
i
am
not
entirely
free
yet
you
know
two
hours
is
the
most
that
i
can
give
you
and
not
entirely
that
there
are
some
details
that
may
not
be
neglected
it
is
a
far
venture
and
now
that
we
have
succeeded
this
far
there
is
surely
no
reason
why
we
can
not
go
on
however
it
is
necessary
that
i
return
to
the
house
on
chatterton
place
i
have
but
slightly
over
an
hour
the
doctor
was
plainly
disappointed
but
the
lecture
it
means
my
life
professor
and
the
subsequent
success
of
our
experiment
a
few
details
a
few
minutes
perhaps
if
we
hurry
we
can
get
back
in
the
doctor
glanced
at
his
watch
twenty
minutes
for
the
train
twenty
minutes
for
the
boat
ten
minutes
that
an
hour
two
hours
these
details
have
you
any
idea
how
long
rhamda
perhaps
not
more
than
fifteen
we
have
still
two
hours
fifteen
minutes
perhaps
a
little
bit
late
tell
you
what
i
shall
go
with
you
you
can
get
on
the
we
have
said
that
the
detective
had
intuition
he
had
it
still
yet
he
had
no
rational
reason
for
suspecting
either
the
professor
or
his
strange
companion
furthermore
he
had
never
heard
of
the
blind
spot
in
any
way
whatsoever
nor
did
he
know
a
single
thing
of
philosophy
or
anything
else
in
holcomb
teaching
he
knew
the
doctor
as
a
man
of
eminent
standing
and
respectability
it
was
hardly
natural
that
he
should
suspect
anything
sinister
to
grow
out
of
this
meeting
of
two
refined
scholars
he
attached
no
great
importance
to
the
trend
of
their
conversation
it
was
strange
to
be
sure
but
he
felt
no
doubt
that
living
in
their
own
world
they
had
a
way
and
a
language
of
their
own
he
was
no
scholar
still
he
could
think
the
man
rhamda
had
made
an
assertion
that
he
could
not
quite
uncover
it
puzzled
him
something
told
him
that
for
the
safety
of
his
old
friend
it
might
be
well
for
him
to
shadow
the
strange
pair
to
the
city
when
the
next
train
pulled
out
for
the
pier
the
two
scholars
were
seated
in
the
forward
part
of
the
car
in
the
last
seat
was
a
man
deeply
immersed
in
a
morning
paper
it
is
rather
unfortunate
in
the
natural
delicacy
of
the
situation
jerome
could
not
crowd
too
closely
he
had
no
certainty
of
trouble
no
proof
whatever
he
was
known
to
the
professor
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
keep
aloof
and
follow
their
movements
at
the
ferry
building
they
hailed
a
taxi
and
started
up
market
street
jerome
watched
them
in
another
moment
he
had
another
driver
and
was
winding
behind
in
their
wheel
tracks
the
cab
made
straight
for
chatterton
place
in
front
of
a
substantial
house
it
drew
up
the
two
men
alighted
taxi
passed
them
they
were
then
at
the
head
of
the
steps
a
woman
of
slender
beauty
with
a
wonderful
loose
fold
of
black
hair
was
talking
it
seemed
to
the
detective
that
her
voice
was
fearful
of
a
pregnant
warning
that
she
was
protesting
nevertheless
the
old
men
entered
and
the
door
slammed
behind
them
jerome
slipped
from
the
taxi
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
the
driver
a
moment
later
the
two
men
were
holding
the
house
under
surveillance
they
did
not
have
long
to
wait
the
man
called
rhamda
had
asked
for
fifteen
minutes
at
the
stroke
of
the
second
the
front
door
someone
was
laughing
a
melodious
enchanting
laugh
and
feminine
a
woman
was
speaking
and
then
there
were
two
forms
in
the
doorway
a
man
and
a
woman
the
man
was
rhamda
avec
tall
immaculate
black
clad
and
distinguished
the
woman
jerome
was
not
certain
that
she
was
the
same
who
opened
the
door
or
not
she
was
even
more
beautiful
she
was
laughing
like
her
companion
she
was
clad
in
black
a
beautiful
shimmering
material
which
sparkled
in
the
sun
like
the
rarest
silk
the
man
glanced
carelessly
up
and
down
the
street
for
a
moment
then
he
assisted
the
lady
down
the
steps
and
into
the
taxi
the
door
slammed
and
before
the
detective
could
gather
his
scattered
wits
they
were
lost
in
the
city
jerome
was
expecting
the
professor
naturally
when
the
door
opened
he
looked
for
the
old
gentleman
and
his
companion
it
was
the
doctor
he
was
watching
not
the
other
though
he
had
no
rational
reason
for
expecting
trouble
he
had
still
his
hunch
and
his
intuition
the
man
and
woman
aroused
suspicion
and
likewise
upset
his
calculation
he
could
not
follow
them
and
stay
with
the
professor
it
was
a
moment
for
quick
decision
he
wondered
where
was
holcomb
this
was
the
day
he
was
to
deliver
his
lecture
on
the
blind
spot
he
had
read
the
announcement
in
the
paper
on
the
way
back
together
with
certain
comments
by
the
editor
in
the
lecture
itself
there
was
mystery
this
strange
one
rhamda
was
mixed
in
the
blind
spot
undoubtedly
he
was
the
essential
fact
and
substance
until
now
he
had
not
scented
tragedy
why
had
rhamda
and
the
woman
come
out
together
where
was
the
professor
where
indeed
at
the
end
of
a
jerome
ventured
across
the
street
he
noted
the
number
then
he
ascended
the
steps
and
clanged
at
the
knocker
from
the
sounds
that
came
from
inside
the
place
was
but
partly
furnished
hollow
steps
sounded
down
the
hallway
shuffling
like
weary
bones
dragging
slippers
the
door
opened
and
an
old
woman
very
old
peered
out
of
the
crack
she
coughed
though
it
was
not
a
loud
cough
it
seemed
to
the
detective
that
it
would
be
her
last
one
there
was
so
little
of
her
pardon
me
but
is
holcomb
here
the
old
lady
looked
up
at
him
the
eyes
were
of
blank
expressionless
blue
she
was
in
her
dotage
you
mean
oh
yes
i
think
so
the
old
man
with
the
white
whiskers
he
was
here
a
few
minutes
ago
with
that
other
but
he
just
went
out
sir
he
just
went
no
i
do
think
so
there
was
a
man
went
out
and
a
woman
but
not
a
woman
there
was
no
oh
yes
there
was
a
woman
a
very
beautiful
the
old
lady
dropped
her
hand
it
was
trembling
oh
dear
she
was
saying
this
makes
two
this
morning
it
was
a
man
and
now
it
is
a
woman
that
makes
it
seemed
to
the
man
as
he
looked
down
in
her
eyes
that
he
was
looking
into
great
fear
she
was
so
slight
and
frail
and
helpless
and
so
old
such
a
fragile
thing
to
bear
burden
and
trouble
her
voice
was
cracked
and
just
above
a
shrill
whisper
almost
uncanny
she
kept
repeating
now
there
are
two
now
there
are
two
that
makes
two
this
morning
there
was
one
now
there
are
jerome
could
not
understand
he
pitied
the
old
lady
did
you
say
that
holcomb
is
here
again
she
looked
up
the
same
blank
expression
she
was
evidently
trying
to
gather
her
wits
two
a
woman
holcomb
oh
yes
holcomb
wo
you
come
in
she
opened
the
door
jerome
entered
and
took
off
his
hat
judicially
he
repeated
the
name
to
keep
it
in
her
mind
she
closed
the
door
carefully
and
touched
his
arm
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
terribly
weak
and
tottering
her
old
eyes
however
expressionless
were
full
of
pitiful
pleading
she
was
scarcely
more
than
a
shadow
you
are
his
son
jerome
lied
but
he
did
it
for
a
reason
then
she
took
him
by
the
sleeve
and
led
him
to
a
room
then
across
it
to
a
door
in
the
side
wall
her
step
was
slow
and
feeble
twice
she
stopped
to
sing
the
dirge
of
her
wonder
first
a
man
and
then
a
woman
now
there
is
one
you
are
his
and
twice
she
stopped
and
listened
do
you
hear
anything
a
bell
i
love
to
hear
it
and
then
afterward
i
am
afraid
did
you
ever
notice
a
bell
it
always
makes
you
think
of
church
and
the
things
that
are
holy
this
is
a
beautiful
bell
first
either
the
woman
was
without
her
reason
or
very
nearly
so
she
was
very
frail
come
mother
i
know
first
a
bell
but
holcomb
the
name
brought
her
back
again
for
a
moment
she
was
blank
trying
to
recall
her
senses
and
then
she
remembered
she
pointed
to
the
door
in
there
holcomb
that
where
they
come
that
where
they
go
holcomb
the
little
old
man
with
the
beautiful
whiskers
this
morning
it
was
a
man
now
it
is
a
woman
now
there
are
two
oh
dear
perhaps
we
shall
hear
the
jerome
began
to
scent
a
tragedy
certainly
the
old
lady
was
uncanny
the
house
was
bare
and
hollow
the
scant
furniture
was
threadbare
with
age
and
mildew
each
sound
was
exaggerated
and
fearful
even
their
breathing
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
knob
and
opened
the
door
now
there
are
two
now
there
are
the
room
was
empty
not
a
bit
of
furniture
a
blank
bare
apartment
with
an
high
ceiling
nothing
else
whatever
the
weirdness
and
adventure
jerome
was
getting
nowhere
the
old
lady
was
still
clinging
to
his
arm
and
still
droning
now
there
are
two
now
there
are
two
this
morning
a
man
now
a
woman
now
there
are
come
mother
come
this
will
not
do
perhaps
but
just
then
the
old
lady
lean
fingers
clinched
into
his
arm
her
eyes
grew
bright
her
mouth
opened
and
she
stopped
in
the
middle
of
her
drone
jerome
grew
rigid
and
no
wonder
from
the
middle
of
the
room
not
ten
feet
away
came
the
tone
of
a
bell
a
great
silvery
voluminous
sound
and
music
a
church
bell
just
one
stroke
full
toned
filling
all
the
air
till
the
whole
room
was
choked
with
music
then
as
suddenly
it
died
out
and
faded
into
nothing
at
the
same
time
he
felt
the
fingers
on
his
arm
relax
and
a
heap
was
at
his
feet
he
reached
over
the
life
and
intelligence
that
was
so
near
the
line
was
just
crossing
over
the
border
the
poor
old
lady
here
was
a
tragedy
he
could
not
understand
he
stooped
over
to
assist
her
he
was
trembling
as
he
did
so
he
heard
the
drone
of
her
soul
as
it
wafted
to
the
shadow
now
there
are
iv
gone
jerome
was
a
strong
man
of
iron
nerve
and
well
set
against
emotion
in
the
run
of
his
experience
he
had
been
plumped
into
many
startling
situations
but
none
like
this
the
croon
of
the
old
lady
thrummed
in
his
ears
with
endless
repetition
he
picked
her
up
tenderly
and
bore
her
to
another
room
and
placed
her
on
a
ragged
sofa
there
were
still
marks
on
her
face
of
former
beauty
he
wondered
who
she
was
and
what
had
been
her
life
to
come
to
such
an
ending
now
there
are
two
the
words
were
withering
with
oppression
subconsciously
he
felt
the
load
that
crushed
her
spirit
it
was
as
if
the
burden
had
been
shifted
he
sensed
the
weight
of
an
unaccountable
disaster
the
place
was
musty
and
he
looked
about
him
the
dank
close
air
was
unwashed
by
daylight
a
stray
ray
of
sunshine
filtering
through
the
broken
shutter
slanted
across
the
room
and
sought
vainly
to
dispel
the
shadow
he
thought
of
holcomb
and
the
old
lady
now
there
are
was
it
a
double
tragedy
first
of
all
he
must
investigate
the
place
was
of
eleven
rooms
six
downstairs
and
five
on
the
upper
story
with
the
exception
of
one
broken
chair
there
was
no
furniture
upstairs
four
of
the
rooms
on
the
lower
floor
were
partly
furnished
two
not
at
all
a
rear
room
had
evidently
been
to
the
old
lady
the
whole
of
her
habitation
serving
as
a
kitchen
bedroom
and
combined
except
in
this
room
there
were
no
carpets
his
steps
sounded
hollow
and
ghostly
the
boards
creaked
and
each
time
he
opened
a
door
he
was
oppressed
by
the
same
gloom
of
dankness
and
stagnation
there
was
no
trace
of
holcomb
he
remembered
the
bell
and
sought
vainly
on
both
floors
for
anything
that
would
give
him
a
clue
to
the
sound
there
was
nothing
the
only
thing
he
heard
was
the
echoing
of
his
own
creaking
footsteps
and
the
unceasing
tune
that
dinned
in
his
spirit
now
there
are
at
last
he
came
to
the
door
and
looked
out
into
the
street
the
sun
was
shining
and
the
life
and
pulse
was
rising
from
the
city
it
was
daylight
plain
healthy
day
it
was
good
to
look
at
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
he
felt
himself
standing
on
the
border
of
two
worlds
what
had
become
of
the
doctor
and
who
was
the
old
lady
and
lastly
and
just
as
important
who
was
the
rhamda
and
his
beautiful
companion
jerome
telephoned
to
headquarters
it
was
a
strange
case
at
the
precise
minute
when
his
auditors
were
beginning
to
fidget
over
his
absence
the
police
of
san
francisco
had
started
the
search
for
the
great
doctor
jerome
had
followed
his
intuition
it
had
led
him
into
a
tragedy
and
he
was
ready
to
swear
almost
on
his
soul
that
it
was
twofold
the
prominence
of
the
professor
together
with
his
startling
announcement
of
the
day
previous
and
the
comment
that
it
had
aroused
elevated
the
case
to
a
national
interest
what
was
the
blind
spot
the
world
conjectured
and
like
the
world
has
been
since
beginning
it
scoffed
and
derided
some
there
were
however
men
well
up
in
the
latest
discoveries
of
science
who
did
not
laugh
they
counselled
forbearance
they
would
wait
for
the
doctor
and
his
lecture
there
was
no
lecture
in
the
teeth
of
our
expectation
came
the
startling
word
that
the
doctor
had
disappeared
apparently
when
on
the
very
verge
of
announcing
his
discovery
he
had
been
swallowed
by
the
very
force
that
he
had
loosened
there
was
nothing
in
known
science
outside
of
optics
that
could
in
any
way
be
blended
with
the
blind
spot
there
were
but
two
solutions
either
the
professor
had
been
a
victim
of
a
clever
rogue
or
he
had
been
overcome
by
the
rashness
of
his
own
wisdom
at
any
rate
it
was
known
from
that
minute
on
as
the
blind
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
to
take
up
the
findings
of
the
police
the
police
of
course
never
entertained
any
suggestion
of
the
occult
they
are
material
and
were
convinced
from
the
start
that
the
case
had
its
origin
in
downright
villainy
man
is
complex
but
being
so
is
oft
overbalanced
by
evil
some
genius
had
made
a
fool
of
the
doctor
in
the
first
place
a
thorough
search
was
made
for
the
professor
the
house
at
no
chatterton
place
was
ransacked
from
cellar
to
attic
the
records
were
gone
over
and
it
was
found
that
the
property
had
for
some
time
been
vacant
that
the
real
ownership
was
vested
in
a
number
of
heirs
scattered
about
the
country
the
old
lady
had
apparently
been
living
on
the
place
simply
through
sufferance
no
one
could
find
out
who
she
was
a
few
tradesman
in
the
vicinity
had
sold
her
some
scant
supplies
and
that
was
all
the
stress
that
jerome
placed
upon
her
actions
and
words
was
given
its
due
account
there
were
undoubtedly
two
villains
but
there
were
two
victims
that
the
old
lady
was
such
as
well
as
the
professor
no
one
has
doubted
the
whole
secret
lay
in
the
gentleman
with
the
eastern
cast
and
complexion
who
was
rhamda
avec
and
now
comes
the
strangest
part
of
the
story
ever
when
we
the
tale
there
is
something
to
overturn
the
theories
of
the
police
it
has
become
a
sort
of
legend
in
san
francisco
one
to
be
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt
to
be
sure
but
for
all
that
one
at
which
we
may
well
wonder
here
the
supporters
of
the
professor
philosophy
hold
their
strongest
point
if
it
is
true
of
course
we
can
venture
no
private
opinion
never
having
been
a
witness
it
is
this
rhamda
avec
is
with
us
and
in
our
city
his
description
and
drawn
likeness
have
been
published
many
times
there
are
those
who
aver
that
they
have
seen
him
in
reality
of
the
flesh
walking
through
the
crowds
of
market
street
he
is
easily
distinguished
tall
and
distinctive
refined
to
a
high
degree
and
with
the
poise
and
alertness
of
a
gentleman
of
reliance
and
character
women
look
twice
and
wonder
he
is
neither
old
nor
young
when
he
smiles
it
is
like
youth
breaking
in
laughter
and
with
him
often
is
his
beautiful
companion
men
vouch
for
her
beauty
and
swear
that
it
is
of
the
kind
that
drives
to
distraction
she
is
fire
and
flesh
and
carnal
she
is
more
than
beauty
there
is
allurement
about
her
body
sinuous
the
olive
tint
of
her
complexion
the
wonderful
glory
of
her
hair
and
the
glowing
of
her
eyes
men
pause
she
is
of
the
superlative
kind
that
robs
the
reason
a
supreme
glory
of
passion
and
life
and
beauty
at
whose
feet
fools
and
wise
men
would
slavishly
frolic
and
folly
she
seldom
speaks
but
those
who
have
heard
her
say
that
it
is
like
rippling
water
of
gentleness
and
softness
and
of
the
mellow
flow
that
comes
from
love
and
passion
and
from
beauty
of
course
there
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
in
their
walking
down
the
streets
anybody
might
do
that
the
wonder
comes
in
the
manner
in
which
they
elude
the
police
they
come
and
go
in
the
broad
bright
daylight
hundreds
have
seen
them
they
make
no
effort
at
concealment
nor
disguise
and
yet
no
phantoms
were
ever
more
unreal
than
they
to
those
who
seek
them
who
are
they
the
officers
have
been
summoned
on
many
occasions
but
each
and
every
time
in
some
manner
or
way
they
had
contrived
to
elude
them
there
are
some
who
have
consigned
them
to
the
limbo
of
illusion
but
we
do
not
entirely
agree
in
a
case
like
this
it
is
well
to
take
into
consideration
the
respectability
and
character
of
those
who
have
witnessed
phantoms
are
not
corporeal
these
two
are
flesh
and
blood
there
is
mystery
about
them
but
they
are
substance
the
same
as
we
are
and
lastly
if
you
will
take
the
key
route
ferry
some
foggy
morning
you
may
see
something
to
convince
you
it
must
be
foggy
and
the
air
must
be
grey
and
drab
and
sombre
take
the
lower
deck
perhaps
you
will
see
nothing
if
not
try
again
for
they
say
you
shall
be
rewarded
watch
the
forward
part
of
the
boat
but
do
not
leave
the
inner
deck
the
great
rhamda
watching
the
grey
swirl
of
the
water
he
stands
alone
in
his
hands
the
case
of
reddish
leather
his
feet
slightly
apart
and
his
face
full
of
a
great
hungry
wonder
watch
his
features
they
are
strong
and
aglow
with
a
great
and
wondrous
wisdom
mark
if
you
see
evil
and
remember
though
he
is
like
you
he
is
something
vastly
different
he
is
flesh
and
blood
but
perhaps
the
master
of
one
of
the
greatest
laws
that
man
can
attain
to
he
is
the
fact
and
the
substance
that
was
promised
but
was
not
delivered
by
the
professor
this
account
has
been
largely
taken
from
one
of
the
sunday
editions
of
our
papers
i
do
not
agree
with
it
entirely
nevertheless
it
will
serve
as
an
excellent
foundation
for
my
own
adventures
and
what
is
best
of
all
save
labour
v
friends
my
name
is
harry
wendel
i
am
an
attorney
and
until
recently
boasted
of
a
splendid
practice
and
an
excellent
prospect
for
the
future
i
am
still
a
young
man
i
have
had
a
good
education
and
still
have
friends
and
admirers
such
being
the
case
you
no
doubt
wonder
why
i
give
a
past
reference
to
my
practice
and
what
the
future
might
have
held
for
me
listen
i
might
as
well
start
back
i
shall
do
it
completely
and
go
back
to
the
time
of
childhood
there
is
a
recollection
of
childish
disaster
i
had
been
making
strenuous
efforts
to
pull
the
tail
out
of
the
cat
that
i
might
use
it
for
a
feather
duster
my
desire
was
supreme
logic
i
could
not
understand
objection
the
cat
resisted
for
certain
utilitarian
reasons
of
its
own
and
my
mother
through
humane
sympathy
i
had
been
scratched
and
spanked
in
addition
it
was
the
first
storm
centre
that
i
remember
i
had
been
punished
but
not
subdued
at
the
first
opportunity
i
stole
out
of
the
house
and
onto
the
lawn
that
stretched
out
to
the
pavement
i
remember
the
day
the
sun
was
shining
the
sky
was
clear
and
everything
was
green
with
springtime
for
a
minute
i
stood
still
and
blinked
in
the
sunlight
it
was
beautiful
and
soft
and
balmy
the
world
at
full
exuberance
the
buds
upon
the
trees
the
flowers
and
the
songbirds
singing
i
could
not
understand
it
it
was
so
beautiful
and
soft
my
heart
was
still
beating
fiercely
still
black
with
perversity
and
stricken
rancour
the
world
had
no
right
to
be
so
i
hated
with
the
full
rush
of
childish
anger
and
then
i
saw
across
the
street
coming
over
to
meet
me
was
a
child
of
my
age
he
was
fat
and
chubby
a
mass
of
yellow
curls
and
laughter
when
he
walked
he
held
his
feet
out
at
angles
as
is
the
manner
of
fat
boys
and
his
arms
away
from
his
body
i
slid
off
the
porch
quietly
here
was
something
that
could
suffer
for
the
cat
and
my
mother
at
my
rush
he
stopped
in
wonder
i
remember
his
smiling
face
and
my
anger
in
an
instant
i
had
him
by
the
hair
and
was
biting
with
all
the
fury
of
vindictiveness
at
first
he
set
up
a
great
bawl
for
assistance
he
could
not
understand
he
screamed
and
held
his
hands
aloft
to
keep
them
out
of
my
reach
then
he
tried
to
run
away
but
i
had
learned
from
the
cat
that
had
scratched
me
i
clung
on
biting
tearing
the
shrill
of
his
scream
was
music
it
was
conflict
sweet
and
delicious
it
was
strife
swift
as
instinct
at
last
i
stopped
him
he
ceased
trying
to
get
away
and
began
to
struggle
it
was
better
still
it
was
resistance
but
he
was
stronger
than
i
though
i
was
quicker
he
managed
to
get
my
by
the
shoulders
to
force
me
back
and
finally
to
upset
me
then
in
the
stolid
way
and
after
the
manner
of
fat
boys
he
sat
upon
my
chest
when
our
startled
mothers
came
upon
the
scene
they
so
found
us
i
upon
my
back
clinching
my
teeth
and
threatening
all
the
dire
fates
of
childhood
and
he
waiting
either
for
assistance
or
until
my
ire
should
retire
sufficiently
to
allow
him
to
release
me
in
safety
who
did
it
who
started
it
that
i
remember
plainly
hobart
did
you
do
this
the
fat
boy
backed
off
quietly
and
clung
to
his
mother
but
he
did
not
answer
hobart
did
you
start
this
still
no
answer
harry
this
was
you
you
started
it
did
you
try
to
hurt
hobart
i
nodded
my
mother
took
me
by
the
hand
and
drew
me
away
he
is
a
rascal
fenton
and
has
a
temper
like
sin
but
he
will
tell
the
truth
thank
i
am
telling
this
not
for
the
mere
relation
but
by
way
of
introduction
it
was
my
first
meeting
with
hobart
fenton
it
is
necessary
that
you
know
us
both
and
our
characters
our
lives
are
so
entwined
and
so
related
that
without
it
you
could
not
get
the
gist
of
the
story
in
the
afternoon
i
came
across
the
street
to
play
with
hobart
he
met
me
smiling
it
was
not
in
his
healthy
little
soul
to
hold
resentment
i
was
either
all
smiles
or
anger
i
forgot
as
quickly
as
i
battled
that
night
there
were
two
happy
youngsters
tucked
into
the
bed
and
covers
so
we
grew
up
one
with
the
other
we
played
as
children
do
and
fought
as
boys
have
done
from
the
beginning
i
shall
say
right
now
that
the
fights
were
mostly
my
fault
i
started
them
one
and
all
and
if
every
battle
had
the
same
beginning
it
likewise
had
the
same
ending
the
first
fight
was
but
the
forerunner
of
all
the
others
please
do
not
think
hardly
of
hobart
he
is
the
kindest
soul
in
the
world
there
never
was
a
truer
lad
nor
a
kinder
heart
he
was
strong
healthy
fat
and
like
fat
boys
forever
laughing
he
followed
me
into
trouble
and
when
i
was
retreating
he
valiantly
defended
the
rear
stronger
sturdier
and
slower
he
has
been
a
sort
of
protector
from
the
beginning
i
have
called
him
the
rear
guard
and
he
does
not
resent
it
i
have
always
been
in
mischief
restless
and
eager
for
anything
that
would
bring
quick
action
and
when
i
got
into
deep
water
hobart
would
come
along
pluck
me
out
and
pull
me
to
shore
and
safety
did
you
ever
see
a
great
mastiff
and
a
fox
terrier
running
together
it
is
a
homely
illustration
but
an
apt
one
we
were
boys
together
with
our
delights
and
troubles
joys
and
sorrows
i
thought
so
much
of
hobart
that
i
did
not
shirk
stooping
to
help
him
take
care
of
his
baby
sister
that
is
about
the
supreme
sacrifice
of
a
boy
devotion
in
after
years
of
course
he
has
laughed
at
me
and
swears
i
did
it
on
purpose
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
i
think
a
whole
lot
of
that
sister
side
by
side
we
grew
up
and
into
manhood
we
went
to
school
and
into
college
even
as
we
were
at
odds
in
our
physical
builds
and
our
dispositions
so
were
we
in
our
studies
from
the
beginning
hobart
has
had
a
mania
for
screws
bolts
nuts
and
pistons
he
is
practical
he
likes
mathematics
he
can
talk
to
you
from
the
binomial
theorem
up
into
calculus
he
is
never
so
happy
as
when
the
air
is
buzzing
with
a
conversation
charged
with
induction
coils
alternating
currents
or
atomic
energy
the
whole
swing
and
force
of
popular
science
is
his
kingdom
i
will
say
for
hobart
that
he
is
just
about
in
line
to
be
king
of
it
all
today
he
is
in
south
america
one
of
our
greatest
engineers
he
is
bringing
the
water
down
from
the
andes
and
it
is
just
about
like
those
strong
shoulders
and
that
good
head
to
restore
the
land
of
the
incas
about
myself
i
went
into
the
law
i
enjoy
an
atmosphere
of
strife
and
contention
i
liked
books
and
discussion
and
i
thought
that
i
would
like
the
law
on
the
advice
of
my
elders
i
entered
law
college
and
in
due
time
was
admitted
to
practice
it
was
while
studying
to
qualify
that
i
first
ran
into
philosophy
i
was
a
lad
to
enjoy
quick
pithy
epigrammatic
statements
i
have
always
favoured
a
man
who
hits
from
the
shoulder
professor
holcomb
was
a
man
of
terse
heavy
thinking
he
spoke
what
he
thought
and
he
did
not
quibble
he
favoured
no
one
i
must
confess
that
the
old
professor
left
his
stamp
upon
me
i
loved
him
like
all
the
rest
though
i
was
not
above
playing
a
trick
on
the
old
fellow
occasionally
still
he
had
a
wit
of
his
own
and
seldom
came
out
second
best
and
when
he
lost
out
he
could
laugh
like
the
next
one
i
was
deeply
impressed
by
him
as
i
took
course
after
course
under
him
i
was
convinced
that
for
all
of
his
dry
philosophy
the
old
fellow
had
a
trick
up
his
sleeve
he
had
a
way
of
expounding
that
was
rather
startling
likewise
he
had
a
scarcely
concealed
contempt
for
some
of
the
demigods
of
our
old
philosophy
what
this
trick
was
i
could
never
uncover
i
hung
on
and
dug
into
great
tomes
of
wisdom
i
became
interested
and
gradually
took
up
with
his
speculation
for
all
my
love
of
action
i
found
that
i
had
a
strong
subcurrent
for
the
philosophical
now
i
roomed
with
hobart
when
i
would
come
home
with
some
dry
tome
and
would
lose
myself
in
it
by
the
hour
he
could
not
understand
it
i
was
preparing
for
the
law
he
could
see
no
advantage
to
be
derived
from
this
digging
into
speculation
he
was
practical
and
unless
he
could
drive
a
nail
into
a
thing
or
at
least
dig
into
its
chemical
elements
it
was
hard
to
get
him
interested
of
what
use
is
it
harry
why
waste
your
brains
these
old
fogies
have
been
pounding
on
the
question
for
three
thousand
years
what
have
they
got
you
could
read
all
their
literature
from
the
pyramids
down
to
the
present
and
you
would
get
enough
practical
wisdom
to
drive
a
that
just
it
i
answered
i
not
hankering
for
a
you
have
an
idea
that
all
the
wisdom
in
the
world
is
locked
up
in
the
concrete
unless
a
thing
has
wheels
pistons
some
sort
of
combustion
or
a
chemical
action
you
are
not
interested
what
gives
you
the
control
over
your
machinery
brains
but
what
makes
the
mind
go
hobart
blinked
fine
he
answered
go
well
i
answered
that
what
i
am
he
laughed
great
well
keep
at
it
it
your
funeral
harry
when
you
have
found
it
let
me
know
and
i
beat
you
to
the
with
that
he
turned
to
his
desk
and
dug
into
one
of
his
everlasting
formulas
just
the
same
next
day
when
i
entered
holcomb
i
was
in
for
a
surprise
my
husky
was
in
the
seat
beside
me
what
the
big
idea
i
asked
big
idea
is
right
harry
he
grinned
just
thought
i
would
beat
you
to
it
had
a
dickens
of
a
time
with
dan
clark
of
the
engineering
department
told
him
i
wanted
to
study
philosophy
the
old
boy
put
up
a
beautiful
holler
could
understand
what
an
engineer
would
want
with
psychology
or
ethics
neither
could
i
until
i
got
to
thinking
last
night
when
i
went
to
roost
because
a
thing
has
never
been
done
is
no
reason
why
it
never
will
be
is
it
harry
certainly
not
i
do
know
just
what
you
are
driving
at
perhaps
you
intend
to
take
your
notes
over
to
the
machine
shop
and
hammer
out
the
secret
of
the
he
grinned
pretty
wise
head
at
that
harry
what
did
you
call
it
the
secret
of
the
absolute
will
remember
that
i
not
much
on
phrases
but
i
sure
the
strong
boy
with
the
hammer
you
do
object
to
my
sitting
here
beside
you
so
that
i
too
may
drink
in
the
little
drops
of
wisdom
it
was
in
this
way
that
hobart
entered
into
the
study
of
philosophy
when
the
class
was
over
and
we
were
going
down
the
steps
he
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
that
not
so
bad
harry
not
so
bad
the
old
doctor
is
there
he
got
them
going
likewise
little
hobart
has
got
a
big
now
it
happened
that
this
was
just
about
six
weeks
before
holcomb
announced
his
great
lecture
on
the
blind
spot
it
was
not
more
than
a
week
after
registration
in
the
time
ensuing
fenton
became
just
as
great
an
enthusiast
as
myself
his
idea
of
course
was
chimerical
and
a
blind
his
main
purpose
was
to
get
in
with
me
where
he
could
argue
me
out
of
my
folly
he
wound
up
by
being
a
convert
of
the
professor
then
came
the
great
day
the
night
of
the
announcement
we
had
a
long
discussion
it
was
a
deep
question
for
all
of
my
faith
in
the
professor
i
was
hardly
prepared
for
a
thing
like
this
strange
to
say
i
was
the
sceptic
and
stranger
still
it
was
hobart
who
took
the
side
of
the
doctor
why
not
he
said
it
merely
comes
down
to
this
you
grant
that
a
thing
is
possible
and
then
you
deny
the
possibility
of
a
proof
outside
of
your
abstract
that
good
paradox
harry
but
almighty
poor
logic
if
it
is
so
it
certainly
can
be
proven
there
not
one
reason
in
the
world
why
we
ca
have
something
concrete
the
professor
is
right
i
am
with
him
he
the
only
professor
in
all
the
well
it
turned
out
as
it
did
it
was
a
terrible
blow
to
us
all
most
of
the
world
took
it
as
a
great
murder
or
an
equally
great
case
of
abduction
there
were
but
few
even
in
the
university
who
embraced
the
side
of
the
doctor
it
was
a
case
of
villainy
of
a
couple
of
remarkably
clever
rogues
and
a
trusting
scholar
but
there
was
one
whose
faith
was
not
diminished
he
had
been
one
of
the
last
to
come
under
the
influence
of
the
doctor
he
was
practical
and
concrete
and
not
at
all
attuned
to
philosophy
he
had
not
the
training
for
deep
dry
thinking
he
would
not
recede
one
whit
one
day
i
caught
him
sitting
down
with
his
head
between
his
hands
i
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
what
the
deep
study
i
asked
him
he
looked
up
by
his
eyes
i
could
see
that
his
thoughts
had
been
far
away
what
the
deep
study
i
repeated
i
was
just
thinking
harry
just
what
i
was
just
thinking
harry
that
i
would
like
to
have
about
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
about
ten
years
that
a
nice
thought
i
answered
i
could
think
that
myself
what
would
you
do
with
it
do
why
there
is
just
one
thing
that
i
would
do
if
i
had
that
much
money
i
would
solve
the
blind
this
happened
years
ago
while
we
were
still
in
college
many
things
have
occurred
since
then
i
am
writing
this
on
the
verge
of
disaster
how
little
do
we
know
what
was
the
idea
that
buzzed
in
the
head
of
hobart
fenton
he
is
concrete
physical
fearless
he
is
in
south
america
i
have
cabled
to
him
and
expect
him
as
fast
as
steam
can
bring
him
the
great
idea
and
discovery
of
the
professor
is
a
fact
not
fiction
what
is
it
that
i
can
not
answer
i
have
found
it
and
i
am
a
witness
to
its
potency
some
law
has
been
missed
through
the
ages
it
is
inexorable
and
insidious
it
is
concrete
out
of
the
unknown
comes
terror
through
the
love
for
the
great
professor
i
have
pitted
myself
against
it
from
the
beginning
it
has
been
almost
hopeless
i
remember
that
last
digression
in
ethics
the
mystery
of
the
occult
may
be
solved
we
are
when
we
bring
the
thing
down
to
the
concrete
we
may
sometimes
i
wonder
at
the
rhamda
is
he
a
man
or
a
phantom
does
he
control
the
blind
spot
is
he
the
substance
and
the
proof
that
was
promised
by
holcomb
through
what
process
and
what
laws
did
the
professor
acquire
even
his
partial
control
over
the
phenomena
where
did
the
rhamda
and
his
beautiful
companion
come
from
who
are
they
and
lastly
what
was
the
idea
that
buzzed
in
the
head
of
hobart
fenton
when
i
look
back
now
i
wonder
i
have
never
believed
in
fate
i
do
not
believe
in
it
now
man
is
the
master
of
his
own
destiny
we
are
cowards
else
whatever
is
to
be
known
we
should
know
it
one
duty
is
ever
to
one
fellows
heads
up
and
onward
i
am
not
a
brave
man
perhaps
under
close
analysis
but
once
i
have
given
my
word
i
shall
keep
it
i
have
done
my
bit
my
simple
duty
perhaps
i
have
failed
in
holding
myself
against
the
blind
spot
i
have
done
no
more
than
would
have
been
done
by
a
million
others
i
have
only
one
regret
failure
is
seldom
rewarded
i
had
hoped
that
my
life
would
be
the
last
i
have
a
dim
hope
still
if
i
fail
in
the
end
there
must
be
still
one
more
to
follow
understand
i
do
not
expect
to
die
it
is
the
unknown
that
i
am
afraid
of
i
who
thought
that
we
knew
so
much
have
found
it
still
so
little
there
are
so
many
laws
in
the
weave
of
cosmos
that
are
still
unguessed
what
is
this
death
that
we
are
afraid
of
what
is
life
can
we
solve
it
is
it
permissible
what
is
the
blind
spot
if
hobart
fenton
is
right
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
death
if
so
what
is
it
my
pen
is
weak
i
am
weary
i
am
waiting
for
hobart
perhaps
i
shall
not
last
when
he
comes
i
want
him
to
know
my
story
what
he
knows
already
will
not
hurt
repeating
it
is
well
that
man
shall
have
it
it
may
be
that
we
shall
both
is
no
telling
but
if
we
do
the
world
can
profit
by
our
blunders
and
guide
itself
perhaps
to
the
mastery
of
the
phenomenon
that
controls
the
blind
spot
i
ask
you
to
bear
with
me
if
i
make
a
few
mistakes
or
i
am
a
bit
loose
remember
the
stress
under
which
i
am
writing
i
shall
try
to
be
plain
so
that
all
may
follow
vi
chick
watson
now
to
go
back
in
due
time
we
were
both
of
us
graduated
from
college
i
went
into
the
law
and
hobart
into
engineering
we
were
both
successful
there
was
not
a
thing
to
foreshadow
that
either
of
us
was
to
be
jerked
from
his
profession
there
was
no
adventure
but
lots
of
work
and
reward
in
proportion
perhaps
i
was
a
bit
more
fortunate
i
was
in
love
and
hobart
was
still
a
confirmed
bachelor
it
was
a
subject
over
which
he
was
never
done
joking
it
was
not
my
fault
i
was
innocent
if
the
blame
ran
anywhere
it
would
have
to
be
placed
upon
that
baby
sister
of
his
it
happened
as
it
happened
since
god
first
made
the
maiden
one
autumn
hobart
and
i
started
off
for
college
we
left
charlotte
at
the
gate
a
girl
of
fifteen
years
and
ten
times
as
many
angles
i
pulled
one
of
her
pigtails
kissed
her
and
told
her
i
wanted
her
to
get
pretty
when
we
came
home
next
summer
i
went
over
to
pull
the
other
pigtail
i
did
not
pull
it
i
was
met
by
the
fairest
young
woman
i
had
ever
looked
on
and
i
could
not
kiss
her
seriously
was
i
to
blame
now
to
the
incident
it
was
a
night
in
september
hobart
had
completed
his
affairs
and
had
booked
passage
to
south
america
he
was
to
sail
next
morning
we
had
dinner
that
day
with
his
family
and
then
came
up
to
san
francisco
for
a
last
and
farewell
bachelor
night
we
could
take
in
the
opera
together
have
supper
at
our
favourite
cafe
and
then
turn
in
it
was
a
long
hark
back
to
our
childhood
but
for
all
that
we
were
still
boys
together
i
remember
that
night
it
was
our
favourite
opera
it
was
the
one
piece
that
we
could
agree
on
looking
back
since
i
have
wondered
at
the
coincidence
the
old
myth
of
age
to
youth
and
the
subcurrent
of
sin
with
its
stalking
laughing
subtle
mephistopheles
it
is
strange
that
we
should
have
gone
to
this
one
opera
on
this
one
evening
i
recall
our
coming
out
of
the
theatre
our
minds
thrilling
to
the
music
and
the
subtle
weirdness
of
the
theme
a
fog
had
fallen
one
of
those
thick
heavy
grey
mists
that
sometimes
come
upon
us
in
september
into
its
sombre
depths
the
crowd
disappeared
like
shadows
the
lights
upon
the
streets
blurred
yellow
at
the
cold
sheer
contact
we
hesitated
upon
the
pavement
i
had
on
a
light
overcoat
hobart
bound
for
the
tropics
had
no
such
protection
it
was
cold
and
miserable
a
chill
wind
stirring
from
the
north
was
unusually
cutting
hobart
raised
his
collar
and
dug
his
hands
into
his
pockets
brr
he
muttered
brr
some
coffee
or
some
wine
the
sidewalks
were
wet
and
slippery
the
mists
settling
under
the
lights
had
the
effect
of
drizzle
i
touched
hobart
arm
and
we
started
across
the
street
brr
is
right
i
answered
and
some
wine
notice
the
shadows
like
we
were
half
across
the
street
before
he
answered
then
he
stopped
ghosts
did
you
say
ghosts
harry
i
noted
a
strange
inflection
in
his
voice
he
stood
still
and
peered
into
the
fog
bank
his
stop
was
sudden
and
suggestive
just
then
a
passing
taxicab
almost
caught
us
and
we
were
compelled
to
dodge
quickly
hobart
ducked
out
of
the
way
and
i
in
another
direction
we
came
up
on
the
sidewalk
again
he
peered
into
the
shadow
confound
that
cab
he
was
saying
now
we
have
gone
and
missed
he
took
off
his
hat
and
then
put
it
back
on
his
head
his
favourite
trick
when
bewildered
i
looked
up
and
down
the
street
did
you
see
him
harry
did
you
see
him
it
was
rhamda
avec
i
had
seen
no
one
that
is
to
notice
i
did
not
know
the
rhamda
neither
did
he
the
rhamda
you
do
know
hobart
was
puzzled
no
he
said
i
do
not
but
it
was
he
just
as
sure
as
i
am
a
fat
i
whistled
i
recalled
the
tale
that
was
now
a
legend
the
man
had
an
affinity
for
the
fog
mist
to
come
out
of
faust
and
to
run
into
the
rhamda
what
was
the
connection
for
a
moment
we
both
stood
still
and
waited
i
wonder
said
hobart
i
was
just
thinking
about
that
fellow
tonight
strange
well
let
get
something
hot
some
but
it
had
given
us
something
for
discussion
certainly
it
was
unusual
during
the
past
few
days
i
had
been
thinking
of
holcomb
and
for
the
last
few
hours
the
tale
had
clung
with
reiterating
persistence
perhaps
it
was
the
weirdness
and
the
tremulous
intoxication
of
the
music
i
was
one
of
the
vast
majority
who
disbelieved
it
was
it
possible
that
it
was
after
all
other
than
the
film
of
fancy
there
are
times
when
we
are
receptive
at
that
moment
i
could
have
believed
it
we
entered
the
cafe
and
chose
a
table
slightly
to
the
rear
it
was
a
contrast
to
the
cold
outside
the
lights
so
bright
the
glasses
clinking
laughter
and
music
a
few
young
people
were
dancing
i
sat
down
in
a
moment
the
lightness
and
jollity
had
stirred
my
blood
hobart
took
a
chair
opposite
the
place
was
full
of
beauty
in
the
back
of
my
mind
blurred
the
image
of
rhamda
i
had
never
seen
him
but
i
had
read
the
description
i
wondered
absently
at
the
persistence
i
have
said
that
i
do
not
believe
in
fate
i
repeat
it
man
should
control
his
own
destiny
a
great
man
does
perhaps
that
is
it
i
am
not
great
certainly
it
was
circumstance
in
the
back
part
of
the
room
at
one
of
the
tables
was
a
young
man
sitting
alone
something
caught
my
attention
perhaps
it
was
his
listlessness
or
the
dreamy
unconcern
with
which
he
watched
the
dancers
or
it
may
have
been
the
utter
forlornness
of
his
expression
i
noted
his
unusual
pallor
and
his
cast
of
dissipation
also
the
continual
working
of
his
long
lean
fingers
there
are
certain
set
fixtures
in
the
night
life
of
any
city
but
this
was
not
one
he
was
not
an
habitue
there
was
a
certain
greatness
to
his
loneliness
and
his
isolation
i
wondered
just
then
he
looked
up
by
a
mere
coincidence
our
eyes
met
he
smiled
a
weak
smile
and
a
forlorn
one
and
it
seemed
to
me
rather
pitiful
then
as
suddenly
his
glance
wandered
to
the
door
behind
me
perhaps
there
was
something
in
my
expression
that
caught
hobart
attention
he
turned
about
say
harry
who
is
that
fellow
i
know
that
face
i
come
to
think
i
have
seen
him
myself
i
wonder
the
young
man
looked
up
again
the
same
weary
smile
he
nodded
and
again
he
glanced
over
my
shoulder
toward
the
door
his
face
suddenly
hardened
he
knows
us
at
any
rate
i
ventured
now
hobart
was
sitting
with
his
face
toward
the
entrance
he
could
see
anyone
coming
or
going
following
the
young
man
glance
he
looked
over
my
shoulder
he
suddenly
reached
over
and
took
me
by
the
forearm
do
look
round
he
warned
take
it
easy
as
i
said
on
my
honour
as
a
fat
the
very
words
foretold
i
could
not
but
risk
a
glance
across
the
room
a
man
was
coming
down
the
aisle
a
tall
man
dark
and
of
a
very
decided
manner
i
had
read
his
description
many
times
i
had
seen
his
likeness
drawn
by
certain
sketch
artists
of
the
city
they
did
not
do
him
justice
he
had
a
wonderful
way
and
presence
you
might
say
magnetism
i
noticed
the
furtive
wondering
glances
that
were
cast
especially
by
the
women
he
was
a
handsome
man
beyond
denying
about
the
handsomest
i
had
ever
seen
the
same
elusiveness
at
first
i
would
have
sworn
him
to
be
near
sixty
the
next
minute
i
was
just
as
certain
of
his
youth
there
was
something
about
him
that
could
not
be
put
to
paper
be
it
strength
force
or
vitality
he
was
subtle
his
step
was
prim
and
distinctive
light
as
shadow
in
one
hand
he
carried
the
red
case
that
was
so
often
mentioned
i
breathed
an
exclamation
hobart
nodded
am
i
a
fat
man
the
famous
rhamda
what
say
ah
ha
he
has
business
with
our
wan
friend
yonder
see
and
it
was
so
he
took
a
chair
opposite
the
wan
one
the
young
man
straightened
his
face
was
even
more
familiar
but
i
could
not
place
him
his
lips
were
set
in
their
grim
line
determination
whatever
his
exhaustion
there
was
still
a
will
somehow
one
had
a
respect
for
this
weak
one
he
was
not
a
mere
weakling
yet
i
was
not
so
sure
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
rhamda
he
spoke
to
the
waiter
the
rhamda
began
talking
i
noted
the
poise
in
his
manner
it
was
not
evil
rather
was
it
calm
and
calculating
he
made
an
indication
the
young
man
drew
back
he
smiled
it
was
feeble
and
weary
but
for
all
of
that
disdainful
though
one
had
a
pity
for
his
forlornness
there
was
still
an
admiration
the
waiter
brought
glasses
the
young
man
swallowed
his
drink
at
a
gulp
the
other
picked
his
up
and
sipped
it
again
he
made
the
indication
the
youth
dropped
his
hand
upon
the
table
a
pale
blue
light
followed
the
movement
of
his
fingers
the
older
man
pointed
so
that
was
their
contention
a
jewel
after
all
our
phantom
was
material
enough
to
desire
possession
his
solicitude
was
calmness
but
for
all
that
aggression
i
could
sense
a
battle
but
the
young
man
turned
the
jewel
to
the
palm
side
of
his
fingers
he
shook
his
head
the
rhamda
drew
up
for
a
moment
he
waited
was
it
for
surrender
once
he
started
to
speak
but
was
cut
short
by
the
other
for
all
of
his
weakness
there
was
spirit
to
the
young
man
he
even
laughed
the
rhamda
drew
out
a
watch
he
held
up
two
fingers
i
heard
hobart
mumble
two
minutes
well
i
betting
on
the
young
one
too
much
soul
not
dead
just
he
was
right
at
exactly
one
hundred
and
twenty
seconds
the
rhamda
closed
his
watch
he
spoke
something
again
the
young
man
laughed
he
lit
a
cigarette
from
the
flicker
and
jerk
of
the
flame
he
was
trembling
but
he
was
still
emphatic
the
other
rose
from
the
table
walked
down
the
aisle
and
out
of
the
building
the
youth
spread
out
both
arms
and
dropped
his
head
upon
the
table
it
was
a
little
drama
enacted
almost
in
silence
hobart
and
i
exchanged
glances
the
mere
glimpse
of
the
rhamda
had
brought
us
both
back
to
the
blind
spot
was
there
any
connection
who
was
the
young
man
with
the
life
sapped
out
i
had
a
recollection
of
a
face
strangely
familiar
hobart
interrupted
my
thoughts
i
give
just
about
one
leg
for
the
gist
of
that
conversation
that
was
the
rhamda
but
who
is
the
other
ghost
do
you
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
blind
spot
i
do
think
averred
hobart
i
know
wonder
what
the
he
glanced
at
his
watch
eleven
just
here
the
young
man
at
the
table
raised
up
his
head
the
cigarette
was
still
between
his
fingers
he
puffed
lamely
for
a
minute
taking
a
dull
note
of
his
surroundings
in
the
well
of
gaiety
and
laughter
coming
from
all
parts
of
the
room
his
actions
were
out
of
place
he
seemed
dazed
unable
to
pull
himself
together
suddenly
he
looked
at
us
he
started
he
certainly
knows
us
i
said
i
wonder
by
george
he
coming
even
his
step
was
feeble
there
was
exertion
about
every
move
of
his
body
the
wanness
and
effort
of
vanished
vitality
he
balanced
himself
carefully
slowly
slowly
line
by
line
his
features
became
familiar
the
underlines
of
another
the
ghost
of
one
departed
at
first
i
could
not
place
him
he
held
himself
up
for
breath
who
was
he
then
it
suddenly
came
to
me
back
to
the
old
days
at
college
an
athlete
one
of
the
best
of
fellows
one
of
the
sturdiest
of
men
he
had
come
to
this
hobart
was
before
me
by
all
the
things
that
are
holy
he
exclaimed
chick
watson
here
have
a
seat
in
the
name
of
heavens
chick
what
on
earth
the
other
dropped
feebly
into
the
chair
the
body
that
had
once
been
so
powerful
was
a
skeleton
his
coat
was
a
disguise
of
padding
hello
hobart
hello
harry
he
spoke
in
a
whisper
not
much
like
the
old
chick
am
i
first
thing
i
take
some
it
was
almost
tragic
i
glanced
at
hobart
and
nodded
to
the
waiter
could
it
be
chick
watson
i
had
seen
him
a
year
before
hale
healthy
prosperous
and
here
he
was
a
wreck
no
he
muttered
i
not
sick
not
sick
lord
boys
it
good
to
meet
you
i
just
thought
i
would
come
out
for
this
one
last
night
hear
some
music
see
a
pretty
face
perhaps
meet
a
friend
but
i
am
afraid
he
dropped
off
like
one
suddenly
drifting
into
slumber
hustle
that
waiter
i
said
to
hobart
hurry
that
the
stimulant
seemed
to
revive
him
he
lifted
up
suddenly
there
was
fear
in
his
eyes
then
on
seeing
himself
among
friends
relief
he
turned
to
me
think
i
sick
do
you
he
asked
you
certainly
are
i
answered
well
i
for
a
moment
silence
i
glanced
at
hobart
hobart
nodded
you
just
about
in
line
for
a
doctor
chick
old
boy
i
said
going
to
see
that
you
have
one
bed
for
you
and
the
care
of
mother
he
started
he
seemed
to
jerk
himself
together
that
it
harry
that
what
i
wanted
it
so
hard
for
me
to
think
mother
mother
that
why
i
came
downtown
i
wanted
a
friend
i
have
something
for
you
to
give
to
rats
i
said
i
take
you
to
her
what
are
you
talking
about
but
he
shook
his
head
i
wish
that
you
were
telling
the
truth
harry
but
it
no
use
not
after
tonight
all
the
doctors
in
the
world
could
not
save
me
i
not
sick
boys
far
from
hobart
spoke
up
what
is
it
chick
i
have
a
suspicion
am
i
right
chick
looked
up
he
closed
his
eyes
all
right
hobart
what
your
suspicion
fenton
leaned
over
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
peering
into
the
soul
he
touched
his
forearm
chick
old
boy
i
think
i
know
but
tell
me
am
i
right
it
the
blind
at
the
words
watson
opened
his
eyes
they
were
full
of
hope
and
wonder
for
a
moment
and
then
as
suddenly
of
a
great
despair
his
body
went
to
a
heap
his
voice
was
feeble
yes
he
answered
i
am
dying
of
the
blind
spot
vii
the
ring
it
was
a
terrible
thing
death
stalking
out
of
the
blind
spot
we
had
almost
forgotten
it
had
been
a
story
hitherto
a
wonderful
one
to
be
sure
and
one
to
arouse
conjecture
i
had
never
thought
that
we
were
to
be
brought
to
its
shivering
contact
it
was
out
of
the
occult
it
had
been
so
pronounced
by
the
professor
a
great
secret
of
life
holding
out
a
guerdon
of
death
to
its
votaries
witness
chick
watson
the
type
of
healthy
fighting
manhood
come
to
this
he
opened
his
eyes
feebly
one
could
see
the
light
the
old
spirit
was
there
fighting
for
life
what
was
this
struggle
of
soul
and
flesh
why
had
the
soul
hung
on
he
made
another
effort
more
drink
he
asked
more
drink
anything
to
hold
me
together
i
must
tell
you
you
must
take
my
place
and
and
fight
the
blind
spot
promise
that
order
the
drinks
i
told
hobart
i
see
hansen
over
there
even
if
we
can
not
save
him
we
must
hold
him
until
we
get
his
i
went
and
fetched
hansen
over
a
strange
case
he
murmured
pulse
normal
not
a
trace
of
fever
not
sick
you
say
hobart
pointed
to
his
head
ah
i
see
i
would
suggest
home
and
a
just
here
watson
opened
his
eyes
again
they
rested
first
upon
the
doctor
then
upon
myself
and
finally
upon
the
brandy
he
took
it
up
and
drank
it
with
eagerness
it
was
his
third
one
it
gave
him
a
bit
more
life
did
i
tell
you
boys
that
there
is
not
a
doctor
on
earth
that
can
save
me
excuse
me
doc
i
am
not
sick
i
told
them
i
am
far
past
physic
i
have
gone
beyond
medicine
all
i
ask
is
stimulant
and
life
enough
to
tell
my
my
boy
asked
the
doctor
kindly
what
ails
you
watson
smiled
he
touched
himself
on
the
forehead
up
here
doc
there
are
things
in
the
world
with
which
we
may
not
tamper
i
tried
it
somebody
had
to
do
it
and
somebody
has
to
do
it
yet
you
remember
holcomb
he
was
a
great
man
he
was
after
the
secret
of
life
he
began
hansen
started
lord
he
exclaimed
looking
at
us
all
you
do
mean
this
man
is
mixed
up
in
the
blind
spot
we
nodded
watson
smiled
again
he
dropped
back
into
inertia
the
speech
he
had
made
was
his
longest
yet
the
brandy
was
coming
into
effect
give
him
brandy
the
doctor
said
it
as
good
as
anything
it
will
hold
him
together
and
give
him
life
for
a
while
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
flicked
something
into
the
glass
that
will
help
him
gentlemen
do
you
know
what
it
means
i
had
always
thought
i
knew
holcomb
crossing
over
the
border
it
may
not
be
done
the
secret
of
life
is
impossible
yet
watson
opened
his
eyes
again
his
spirit
seemed
suddenly
to
flicker
into
defiance
who
said
it
was
impossible
who
said
it
gentlemen
it
is
possible
holcomb
pardon
me
i
do
not
wish
to
appear
a
sot
but
this
brandy
is
about
the
only
thing
to
hold
me
together
i
have
only
a
few
hours
he
took
the
glass
and
at
one
gulp
downed
the
contents
i
do
not
know
what
the
doctor
had
dropped
into
it
chick
revived
suddenly
and
a
strange
light
blazed
up
in
his
eyes
like
life
rekindled
ah
now
i
am
better
so
he
turned
to
us
all
then
to
the
doctor
so
you
say
the
secret
of
life
is
impossible
i
chick
smiled
wanly
may
i
ask
you
what
it
is
that
has
just
flared
up
within
me
i
am
weak
anaemic
fallen
to
pieces
my
muscles
have
lost
the
power
to
function
my
blood
runs
cold
i
have
been
more
than
two
feet
over
the
border
and
yet
a
few
drinks
of
brandy
of
stimulants
and
you
have
drawn
me
back
my
heart
beats
strongly
for
an
hour
by
means
of
drugs
you
have
infused
a
new
life
which
of
course
is
the
old
and
driven
the
material
components
of
my
body
into
correlation
you
are
successful
for
a
time
so
long
as
nature
is
with
you
but
all
the
while
you
are
held
aghast
by
the
knowledge
that
the
least
flaw
the
least
disarrangement
and
you
are
beaten
it
is
your
business
to
hold
this
life
or
what
you
may
when
it
has
gone
your
structures
your
anatomy
your
wonderful
human
machine
is
worthless
where
has
it
come
from
where
has
it
gone
i
have
drunk
four
glasses
of
brandy
i
have
a
lease
of
four
short
hours
ordinarily
it
would
bring
reaction
it
is
poison
to
be
sure
but
it
is
driving
back
my
spirit
giving
me
life
and
strength
enough
to
tell
my
story
in
the
morning
i
shall
be
no
more
by
sequence
i
am
a
dead
man
already
four
glasses
of
brandy
they
are
speaking
whence
comes
this
affinity
of
substance
and
of
shadow
we
all
of
us
listened
the
doctor
most
of
all
go
on
he
said
ca
you
see
repeated
watson
there
is
affinity
between
substance
and
shadow
and
therefore
your
spirit
or
shadow
or
what
you
will
is
concrete
is
in
itself
a
substance
it
is
material
just
as
much
as
you
are
because
you
do
not
see
it
is
no
proof
that
it
is
not
substance
that
pot
palm
yonder
does
not
see
you
it
is
not
blessed
with
the
doctor
looked
at
watson
he
spoke
gently
this
is
very
old
stuff
my
boy
out
of
your
abstract
philosophy
no
man
knows
the
secret
of
life
not
even
the
light
in
watson
eyes
grew
brighter
he
straightened
he
began
slipping
the
ring
from
his
finger
no
he
answered
i
do
i
have
tried
and
it
was
like
playing
with
lightning
i
sought
for
life
and
it
is
giving
me
death
but
there
is
one
man
living
who
has
found
and
this
man
is
holcomb
we
all
of
us
started
we
had
every
one
given
the
doctor
up
as
dead
the
very
presence
of
watson
was
tragedy
we
did
not
doubt
that
he
had
been
through
some
terrible
experience
there
are
things
in
the
world
that
may
not
be
unriddled
some
power
some
sinister
thing
was
reaching
for
his
vitality
what
did
he
know
about
the
professor
holcomb
had
been
a
long
time
dead
gentlemen
you
must
hear
my
story
i
have
long
to
tell
it
however
before
i
start
here
is
a
proof
for
a
he
tossed
the
ring
upon
the
table
it
was
hobart
who
picked
it
up
a
beautiful
stone
like
a
sapphire
blue
but
uncut
and
of
a
strange
pellucid
transparency
a
jewel
undoubtedly
but
of
a
kind
we
have
never
seen
we
all
of
us
examined
it
and
were
all
i
am
afraid
a
bit
disappointed
it
was
a
stone
and
nothing
else
watson
watched
us
the
waiter
had
brought
more
brandy
and
watson
was
sipping
it
not
because
he
liked
it
he
said
but
just
to
keep
himself
at
the
proper
lift
you
do
understand
it
eh
you
see
nothing
hobart
have
you
a
match
there
that
it
now
give
me
the
ring
see
he
struck
the
match
and
held
the
flame
against
the
jewel
gentlemen
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
speak
the
stone
will
give
you
a
volume
it
not
trickery
i
assure
you
but
fact
there
now
perfect
doctor
you
are
the
sceptic
take
a
look
at
the
the
doctor
picked
it
up
casually
and
held
it
up
before
his
eyes
at
first
he
frowned
then
came
a
look
of
incredulity
his
chin
dropped
and
he
rose
in
his
chair
my
god
he
exclaimed
the
man
living
it
he
but
hobart
and
i
had
crowded
over
the
doctor
held
the
ring
so
we
could
see
it
inside
the
stone
was
holcomb
it
was
a
strenuous
moment
and
the
most
incredible
we
all
of
us
knew
the
doctor
it
was
not
a
photograph
nor
a
likeness
but
the
man
himself
it
was
beyond
all
reason
that
he
could
be
in
the
jewel
indeed
there
was
only
the
head
visible
one
could
catch
the
expression
of
life
the
movements
of
the
eyelids
yet
how
could
it
be
what
was
it
it
was
hobart
who
spoke
first
chick
he
asked
what
the
meaning
were
it
not
for
my
own
eyes
i
would
call
it
impossible
it
absurd
on
the
face
the
doctor
yet
i
can
see
him
living
where
is
he
chick
nodded
that
the
whole
question
where
is
he
i
know
and
yet
i
know
nothing
you
are
now
looking
into
the
blind
spot
the
doctor
sought
the
secret
of
life
and
found
it
he
was
trapped
by
his
own
wisdom
viii
the
nervina
for
a
moment
we
were
silent
the
jewel
reposed
upon
the
table
what
was
the
secret
of
its
phenomena
i
could
think
of
nothing
in
science
that
would
explain
it
how
had
watson
come
into
its
possession
what
was
the
tale
he
had
to
tell
the
lean
long
finger
that
clutched
for
brandy
what
force
was
this
that
had
driven
him
to
such
a
verge
he
was
resigned
though
he
was
defiant
he
had
already
conceded
his
surrender
hansen
spoke
watson
he
asked
what
do
you
know
about
the
blind
spot
we
all
turned
to
chick
hobart
ordered
more
brandy
the
doctor
eyes
went
to
slits
i
could
not
but
wonder
chick
i
asked
who
is
rhamda
avec
watson
turned
you
saw
him
a
few
minutes
ago
you
saw
him
with
me
let
me
ask
yes
i
answered
i
saw
him
most
people
did
is
he
invisible
is
he
really
the
phantom
they
say
somehow
the
mention
of
the
name
made
him
nervous
he
looked
cautiously
about
the
room
that
i
do
know
harry
it
if
i
can
only
get
my
wits
together
is
he
a
phantom
yes
i
think
so
i
ca
understand
him
at
least
he
has
the
powers
we
attribute
to
an
apparition
he
is
strange
and
unaccountable
sometimes
you
see
him
sometimes
you
do
the
first
known
of
him
was
on
the
day
professor
holcomb
was
to
deliver
his
lecture
on
the
blind
spot
he
was
tracked
you
know
to
the
very
act
then
came
in
the
and
who
is
the
nervina
watson
looked
at
me
blankly
the
nervina
he
asked
the
nervina
what
do
you
know
about
the
nervina
nothing
you
mentioned
her
just
his
mind
seemed
to
ramble
he
looked
about
the
room
rather
fearfully
perhaps
he
was
afraid
did
i
mention
her
i
do
know
harry
my
wits
are
muddled
the
nervina
she
is
a
goddess
never
was
and
never
will
be
woman
she
loves
she
never
hates
and
still
again
she
does
not
love
she
is
beautiful
too
beautiful
for
man
i
quit
is
she
rhamda
wife
his
eyes
lit
fire
no
do
you
love
her
he
went
blank
again
but
at
last
he
spoke
slowly
no
i
do
love
her
what
the
use
she
not
for
me
i
did
but
i
learned
better
i
was
after
the
professor
and
the
blind
spot
she
again
that
look
of
haunted
pursuit
he
glanced
about
the
room
whatever
had
been
his
experience
it
was
plain
that
he
had
not
given
up
he
held
something
and
he
held
it
still
what
was
it
you
say
you
did
find
the
blind
spot
no
i
did
not
find
have
you
any
idea
my
dear
harry
he
answered
i
am
full
of
ideas
that
the
trouble
i
am
near
it
it
the
cause
of
my
present
condition
i
do
know
just
what
it
is
nor
where
a
condition
or
a
combination
of
phenomena
you
remember
the
lecture
that
was
never
delivered
had
the
doctor
spoken
that
morning
the
world
would
have
had
a
great
fact
he
had
made
a
great
discovery
it
is
a
terrible
he
turned
the
ring
so
we
could
all
see
it
beyond
all
doubt
it
was
the
doctor
there
he
is
the
professor
if
he
could
only
speak
the
secret
of
the
ages
just
think
what
it
means
where
is
he
i
have
taken
that
jewel
to
the
greatest
lapidaries
and
they
have
one
and
all
been
startled
then
they
all
come
to
the
same
conclusion
trickery
chinese
or
hindu
work
they
say
most
of
them
want
to
have
you
taken
it
to
the
police
why
i
would
simply
be
laughed
have
you
ever
reported
this
rhamda
a
score
of
times
they
have
come
and
sought
but
every
time
he
has
gone
out
like
a
shadow
it
got
to
be
an
old
story
now
if
you
call
them
up
and
tell
them
they
how
do
you
account
for
it
i
do
i
i
i
just
and
not
one
member
of
the
force
surely
oh
yes
there
one
you
have
heard
of
jerome
jerome
followed
the
professor
and
the
rhamda
to
the
house
of
the
blind
spot
as
he
calls
it
he
not
a
man
to
fool
he
had
eyes
and
he
saw
it
he
will
not
leave
it
till
he
but
he
did
not
see
the
blind
spot
did
he
how
about
trickery
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
the
professor
might
have
been
murdered
take
a
look
at
that
harry
does
that
look
like
murder
when
you
see
the
man
living
watson
reached
over
and
turned
up
the
jewel
here
hobart
came
in
just
a
minute
chick
my
wise
friend
here
is
an
attorney
he
always
the
first
into
everything
especially
conversation
it
been
my
job
pulling
harry
out
of
trouble
just
one
all
did
you
er
keep
company
as
they
say
with
bertha
holcomb
while
at
college
a
kind
look
came
into
the
man
eyes
he
nodded
his
whole
face
was
soft
and
saddened
i
see
that
naturally
brought
you
to
the
blind
spot
you
are
after
her
father
am
i
correct
all
right
perhaps
bertha
has
taken
you
into
some
of
her
secrets
he
undoubtedly
had
data
on
this
blind
spot
have
you
ever
been
able
to
locate
it
no
i
see
this
rhamda
has
he
ever
sought
that
data
many
many
does
he
know
you
have
got
it
so
i
understand
you
hold
the
whip
hand
through
your
ignorance
rhamda
is
your
villain
and
perhaps
this
nervina
who
is
she
a
hobart
smiled
oh
yes
he
laughed
a
goddess
naturally
they
all
are
there
are
about
forty
in
this
room
at
the
present
moment
my
dear
fellow
watch
them
dance
now
i
had
picked
up
the
ring
it
just
fitted
the
natural
finger
i
tried
it
on
and
looked
into
the
jewel
the
professor
was
growing
dimmer
the
marvellous
blue
was
returning
a
hue
of
fascination
not
the
hot
flash
of
the
diamond
but
the
frozen
light
of
the
iceberg
it
was
frigid
cold
terrible
blue
alluring
to
me
at
the
moment
it
seemed
alive
and
pulselike
i
could
not
account
for
it
i
felt
the
lust
for
possession
perhaps
there
was
something
in
my
face
watson
leaned
over
and
touched
me
on
the
arm
harry
he
asked
do
you
think
you
can
stand
up
under
the
burden
will
you
take
my
place
i
looked
into
his
eyes
in
their
black
depths
was
almost
entreaty
how
haunting
they
were
and
beseeching
will
you
take
my
place
he
begged
are
you
willing
to
give
up
all
that
god
gives
to
the
fortunate
will
you
give
up
your
practice
will
you
hold
out
to
the
end
never
surrender
will
you
mean
will
i
take
this
ring
he
nodded
exactly
but
you
must
know
beforehand
it
would
be
murder
to
give
it
to
you
without
the
warning
either
your
death
or
that
of
holcomb
it
is
not
a
simple
jewel
it
defies
description
it
takes
a
man
to
wear
it
it
is
subtle
and
of
destruction
it
eats
like
a
canker
it
destroys
the
body
it
frightens
the
soul
an
ominous
piece
of
finery
i
spoke
wherein
but
watson
interrupted
there
was
appeal
in
his
eyes
harry
he
went
on
i
am
asking
somebody
has
got
to
wear
this
ring
he
must
be
a
man
he
must
be
fearless
he
must
taunt
the
devil
it
is
hard
work
i
assure
you
i
can
not
last
much
longer
you
loved
the
old
doctor
if
we
get
at
this
law
we
have
done
more
for
mankind
than
either
of
us
may
do
with
his
profession
we
must
save
the
old
professor
he
is
living
and
he
is
waiting
there
are
perils
and
forces
that
we
do
not
know
of
the
doctor
went
at
it
alone
and
fearless
he
succumbed
to
his
own
wisdom
i
have
followed
after
and
i
have
been
crushed
down
perhaps
by
my
ignorance
i
am
not
afraid
but
i
do
want
my
work
to
die
somebody
has
got
to
take
it
on
and
you
are
the
they
were
all
of
them
looking
at
me
i
studied
the
wonderful
blue
and
its
light
the
image
of
the
great
professor
had
dimmed
almost
completely
it
was
a
sudden
task
and
a
great
one
here
was
a
law
one
of
the
great
secrets
of
cosmos
what
was
it
somehow
the
lure
caught
into
my
vitals
i
could
picture
myself
ever
coming
to
the
extremity
of
my
companion
besides
it
was
a
duty
i
owed
it
to
the
old
doctor
it
seemed
somehow
that
he
was
speaking
though
watson
did
the
talking
i
could
feel
him
calling
would
i
be
afraid
besides
there
was
the
jewel
it
was
calling
already
i
could
feel
it
burning
into
my
spirit
i
looked
up
do
you
take
it
harry
i
nodded
i
do
god
knows
i
am
worthless
enough
i
take
it
up
it
may
give
me
a
chance
to
engage
with
this
famous
be
careful
of
rhamda
harry
and
above
all
do
let
him
have
the
why
because
now
listen
i
not
laying
this
absolutely
understand
nevertheless
the
facts
all
point
in
one
direction
hold
the
ring
somewhere
in
that
lustre
lies
a
great
secret
it
controls
the
blind
spot
the
rhamda
himself
may
not
take
it
off
your
finger
you
are
immune
from
violence
only
the
ring
itself
may
kill
he
coughed
god
knows
he
spoke
it
has
killed
it
was
rather
ominous
the
mere
fact
of
that
cough
and
his
weakness
was
enough
one
would
come
to
this
he
had
warned
me
and
he
had
besought
me
with
the
same
voice
as
the
warning
but
what
is
the
blind
spot
then
you
take
the
ring
what
is
the
time
twelve
gentlemen
now
here
comes
in
one
of
the
strange
parts
of
my
story
one
that
i
can
not
account
for
over
the
shoulder
of
hansen
i
could
watch
the
door
whether
it
was
the
ring
or
not
i
do
not
know
at
the
time
i
did
not
reason
i
acted
upon
impulse
it
was
an
act
beyond
good
breeding
i
had
never
done
such
a
thing
before
i
had
never
even
seen
the
woman
the
woman
why
do
i
say
it
she
was
never
a
woman
she
was
a
girl
far
far
transcendent
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
her
standing
there
before
the
door
i
had
never
beheld
such
beauty
such
profile
poise
the
witching
laughing
of
her
eyes
the
perfectly
bridged
nose
and
the
red
red
lips
that
smiled
it
seemed
to
me
in
sadness
she
hesitated
and
as
if
puzzled
lifted
a
jewelled
hand
to
her
raven
mass
of
hair
to
this
minute
i
can
not
account
for
my
action
unless
perchance
it
was
the
ring
perhaps
it
was
anyway
i
had
risen
how
well
do
i
remember
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
known
her
a
long
long
time
there
was
something
about
her
that
was
not
seduction
but
far
far
above
it
somewhere
i
had
seen
her
had
known
her
she
was
looking
and
she
was
waiting
for
me
there
was
something
about
her
that
was
super
feminine
i
thought
it
then
and
i
say
it
now
just
then
her
glance
came
my
way
she
smiled
and
nodded
there
was
a
note
of
sadness
in
her
voice
harry
wendel
there
is
no
accounting
for
my
action
nor
my
wonder
she
knew
me
then
it
was
true
i
was
not
mistaken
somewhere
i
had
seen
her
i
felt
a
vague
and
dim
rush
of
dreamy
recollections
ah
that
was
the
answer
she
was
a
girl
of
dreams
and
phantoms
even
then
i
knew
it
she
was
not
a
woman
not
as
we
conceive
her
she
was
some
materialisation
out
of
heaven
why
do
i
talk
so
ah
this
strange
beauty
that
is
woman
from
the
very
first
she
held
me
in
the
thrall
that
has
no
explanation
do
we
dance
she
asked
simply
the
next
moment
i
had
her
in
my
arms
and
we
were
out
among
the
dancers
that
my
actions
were
queer
and
entirely
out
of
reason
never
occurred
to
me
there
was
a
call
about
her
beautiful
body
and
in
her
eyes
that
i
could
not
answer
there
was
a
fact
between
us
some
strange
bond
that
was
beyond
even
passion
i
danced
and
in
an
extreme
emotion
of
happiness
a
girl
out
of
the
dreams
and
the
ether
a
sprig
of
life
woven
out
of
the
moonbeams
do
you
know
me
she
asked
as
we
danced
yes
i
answered
and
no
i
have
seen
you
but
i
do
not
remember
you
come
from
the
she
laughed
prettily
do
you
always
talk
like
this
you
are
out
of
my
dreams
i
answered
it
is
sufficient
but
who
are
you
she
held
back
her
pretty
head
and
looked
at
me
her
lips
drooped
slightly
at
the
corners
a
sad
smile
and
tender
in
the
soft
wonderful
depths
of
her
eyes
a
pity
harry
she
asked
are
you
going
to
wear
this
ring
so
that
was
it
the
ring
and
the
maiden
what
was
the
bond
there
was
weirdness
in
its
colour
almost
cabalistic
a
call
out
of
the
occult
the
strange
beauty
of
the
girl
her
remarkable
presence
and
her
concern
whoever
and
whatever
she
was
her
anxiety
was
not
personal
in
some
way
she
was
woven
up
with
this
ring
and
poor
watson
i
think
i
shall
i
answered
again
the
strange
querulous
pity
and
hesitation
her
eyes
grew
darker
almost
pleading
you
wo
give
it
to
me
how
near
i
came
to
doing
it
i
shall
not
tell
it
would
be
hard
to
say
it
i
knew
vaguely
that
she
was
playing
that
i
was
the
plaything
it
is
hard
for
a
man
to
think
of
himself
as
being
toyed
with
she
was
certain
she
was
confident
of
my
weakness
it
was
resentment
perhaps
and
pride
of
self
that
gave
the
answer
i
think
i
shall
keep
do
you
know
the
danger
harry
it
is
death
to
wear
it
a
thousand
perils
then
i
shall
keep
it
i
like
peril
you
wish
for
the
ring
if
i
keep
it
i
may
have
you
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
danced
with
the
girl
out
of
the
her
eyes
snapped
and
she
stopped
dancing
i
do
think
my
words
displeased
her
she
was
still
a
woman
is
this
final
you
a
fine
young
man
wendel
i
know
you
i
stepped
in
to
save
you
you
are
playing
with
something
stranger
than
the
moonbeams
no
man
may
wear
that
ring
and
hold
to
life
again
harry
i
ask
you
for
your
own
at
this
moment
we
passed
watson
he
was
watching
as
our
eyes
glanced
he
shook
his
head
who
was
this
girl
she
was
as
beautiful
as
sin
and
as
tender
as
a
virgin
what
interest
had
she
in
myself
that
just
the
reason
i
laughed
you
are
too
interested
you
are
too
beautiful
to
wear
it
i
am
a
man
i
revel
in
trouble
you
are
a
girl
it
would
not
be
honourable
to
allow
you
to
take
it
i
shall
keep
she
had
overreached
herself
and
she
knew
it
she
bit
her
lip
but
she
took
it
gracefully
so
much
so
in
fact
that
i
thought
she
meant
it
i
sorry
she
answered
slowly
i
had
hopes
it
is
terrible
to
look
at
watson
and
then
to
think
of
you
it
is
really
a
faint
tremor
ran
through
her
body
her
hand
trembled
it
is
terrible
you
young
men
are
so
unafraid
it
too
just
then
the
door
was
opened
outside
i
could
see
the
bank
of
fog
someone
passed
she
turned
a
bit
pale
excuse
me
i
must
be
going
do
you
see
i
sorry
she
held
out
her
hand
the
same
sad
little
smile
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
unmindful
of
place
i
drew
it
to
my
lips
and
kissed
it
she
was
gone
i
returned
to
the
table
the
three
men
were
watching
me
watson
analytically
the
doctor
with
wonder
and
hobart
with
plain
disgust
hobart
spoke
first
nice
for
sister
charlotte
eh
harry
i
had
not
a
word
to
say
in
the
full
rush
of
the
moment
i
knew
that
he
was
right
it
was
all
out
of
reason
i
had
no
excuse
outside
of
sheer
insanity
and
dishonour
the
doctor
said
nothing
it
was
only
in
watson
face
that
there
was
a
bit
of
understanding
hobart
he
said
i
have
told
you
it
is
not
harry
fault
it
is
the
nervina
no
man
may
resist
her
she
is
beauty
incarnate
she
weaves
with
the
hearts
of
men
and
she
loves
no
one
it
is
the
ring
she
the
rhamda
the
blind
spot
and
the
ring
i
have
never
been
able
to
unravel
them
please
do
blame
harry
he
went
to
her
even
as
i
she
has
but
to
beckon
but
he
kept
the
ring
i
watched
them
this
is
but
the
but
hobart
muttered
she
a
beauty
all
right
a
beauty
that
the
rub
i
know
harry
i
know
him
as
a
brother
and
i
want
him
so
in
fact
but
i
hate
to
trust
that
watson
smiled
never
fear
hobart
your
sister
is
safe
enough
the
nervina
is
not
a
woman
she
is
not
of
the
brr
said
the
doctor
you
give
me
the
watson
reached
for
the
brandy
he
nodded
to
the
doctor
just
a
bit
more
of
that
stuff
if
you
please
whatever
it
is
on
the
last
night
one
has
no
fear
of
habit
there
now
gentlemen
if
you
will
come
with
me
i
shall
take
you
to
the
house
of
the
blind
ix
now
there
are
three
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
when
we
stepped
to
the
pavement
the
whole
world
was
shrouded
the
heavy
fog
clung
like
depression
life
was
gone
out
a
foreboding
of
gloom
and
disaster
it
was
cold
dank
miserable
one
shuddered
instinctively
and
battered
against
the
wall
with
steaming
columns
of
breath
just
outside
the
door
we
were
detained
dr
hansen
someone
stepped
beside
us
dr
hansen
yes
a
message
the
doctor
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
bother
he
spoke
bother
a
message
nothing
in
the
world
would
stop
me
i
can
not
nevertheless
he
stepped
back
into
the
light
just
a
minute
he
tore
open
the
envelope
then
he
looked
up
at
the
messenger
and
then
at
us
his
face
was
startled
almost
frightened
gentlemen
he
said
i
am
sorry
not
a
thing
in
the
world
would
detain
me
but
this
i
would
go
with
you
but
i
may
not
my
duty
as
a
physician
i
had
he
came
over
to
me
and
spoke
softly
i
am
going
to
send
you
one
of
the
greatest
specialists
in
the
city
in
my
stead
this
young
man
should
have
attention
have
you
the
address
chatterton
place
i
answered
very
well
i
am
sorry
very
much
disappointed
however
it
is
my
daughter
and
i
can
not
do
otherwise
continue
the
brandy
for
a
while
and
he
slipped
an
envelope
into
my
hand
by
that
time
higgins
will
be
with
you
think
there
is
hope
i
asked
there
always
hope
replied
the
doctor
i
returned
to
my
companions
they
were
walking
slowly
it
was
work
for
poor
watson
he
dragged
on
leaning
on
hobart
arm
but
at
last
he
gave
up
no
he
said
i
ca
make
it
i
too
far
gone
i
had
thought
oh
what
a
lapse
it
has
been
i
am
eighty
years
of
age
one
year
ago
i
was
a
boy
if
only
i
had
some
more
brandy
i
have
some
at
the
house
we
must
make
that
i
must
show
you
there
i
can
give
you
the
hail
a
cab
i
said
here
one
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
before
the
house
of
the
blind
spot
it
was
a
two
storey
drab
affair
much
like
a
thousand
others
and
might
have
been
built
in
the
early
nineties
it
had
been
outside
of
the
fire
limits
of
and
so
had
survived
the
great
disaster
chatterton
place
is
really
a
short
street
running
lengthwise
along
the
summit
of
the
hill
a
flight
of
stone
steps
descended
to
the
pavement
watson
straightened
up
with
an
effort
this
is
the
house
he
spoke
i
came
here
a
year
ago
i
go
away
tonight
i
had
hoped
to
find
it
i
promised
bertha
i
came
alone
i
had
reasons
to
believe
i
had
solved
it
i
found
the
rhamda
and
the
nervina
i
had
iron
will
and
courage
also
strength
the
rhamda
was
never
able
to
control
me
my
life
is
gone
but
not
my
will
now
i
have
left
him
another
do
not
surrender
harry
it
is
a
gruesome
task
but
hold
on
to
the
end
help
me
up
the
steps
there
now
just
wait
a
minute
till
i
fetch
a
he
did
not
ring
for
a
servant
that
i
noticed
instead
he
groped
about
for
a
key
unlocked
the
door
and
stumbled
into
a
room
he
fumbled
for
a
minute
among
some
glasses
will
you
switch
on
a
light
he
asked
hobart
struck
a
match
when
he
found
it
he
pressed
the
switch
the
room
in
which
we
were
standing
was
a
large
one
fairly
well
furnished
and
lined
on
two
sides
with
bookshelves
in
the
centre
was
an
oak
table
cluttered
with
papers
a
couple
of
chairs
and
on
one
of
them
a
heavy
pipe
which
somehow
i
did
not
think
of
as
watson
he
noticed
my
look
jerome
he
explained
we
live
here
jerome
the
detective
and
myself
he
has
been
here
since
the
day
of
the
doctor
disappearance
i
came
here
a
year
ago
he
is
in
nevada
at
present
that
leaves
me
alone
you
will
notice
the
books
mostly
occult
partly
mine
partly
the
detective
we
have
gone
at
it
systematically
from
the
beginning
we
have
learned
almost
everything
but
what
would
help
us
mostly
sophistry
and
guesswork
beats
all
how
much
ink
has
been
wasted
to
say
nothing
we
were
after
the
blind
but
what
is
it
is
it
in
this
house
i
can
answer
one
part
of
your
question
he
answered
but
not
the
other
it
is
here
somewhere
in
some
place
jerome
is
positive
of
that
you
remember
the
old
lady
the
one
who
died
her
actions
were
rather
positive
even
if
feeble
she
led
jerome
to
this
next
he
turned
and
pointed
the
door
was
open
i
could
see
a
sofa
and
a
few
chairs
that
was
all
it
was
in
here
the
bell
jerome
never
gets
tired
of
telling
a
church
bell
in
the
centre
of
the
room
at
first
i
did
believe
but
now
i
accept
it
all
i
know
but
what
i
know
is
by
sort
of
sixth
sense
yes
or
you
never
saw
this
bell
nor
found
it
never
were
able
to
arrive
at
an
explanation
how
about
the
rhamda
the
nervina
do
they
come
to
this
house
not
how
do
they
come
in
through
the
window
he
smiled
rather
sadly
i
do
know
at
least
they
come
you
shall
see
them
yourself
the
rhamda
still
has
something
to
do
with
holcomb
somehow
his
very
concern
tells
me
the
doctor
is
safe
undoubtedly
the
professor
made
a
great
discovery
but
he
was
not
alone
he
had
a
the
rhamda
for
reasons
of
his
own
the
rhamda
wishes
to
control
the
blind
then
the
professor
is
in
this
blind
spot
we
think
so
at
least
it
is
our
conjecture
we
do
not
then
you
do
think
it
trickery
no
hardly
harry
you
know
better
than
that
can
you
imagine
the
great
doctor
the
dupe
of
a
mere
trickster
the
professor
was
a
man
of
great
science
and
was
blessed
with
an
almighty
sound
head
but
he
had
one
hobart
spoke
up
what
is
it
chick
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
the
old
boy
was
honest
exactly
he
had
been
a
scholar
all
his
life
he
taught
ethics
he
believed
in
right
he
practised
his
creed
when
he
came
to
the
crucial
experiment
he
found
himself
dealing
with
a
rogue
the
rhamda
helped
him
just
so
far
but
once
he
had
the
professor
in
his
power
it
was
not
his
purpose
to
release
him
until
he
was
secure
of
the
blind
i
see
i
spoke
the
man
is
a
villain
i
think
we
can
handle
but
watson
shook
his
head
that
just
it
harry
the
man
if
he
were
a
man
i
could
have
handled
him
in
short
order
that
what
i
thought
at
first
do
make
any
mistake
do
try
violence
that
the
whole
crux
of
the
difficulty
if
he
were
only
a
man
unfortunately
he
is
not
a
man
i
exclaimed
what
do
you
mean
then
what
is
he
he
is
a
i
glanced
at
hobart
and
caught
his
eye
hobart
believed
him
the
poor
pallid
face
of
watson
the
athlete
there
was
nothing
left
to
him
but
his
soul
i
shall
not
forget
watson
as
he
sat
there
his
lean
long
fingers
grasping
the
brandy
glass
his
eyes
burning
and
his
life
holding
back
from
the
pit
through
sheer
will
and
courage
would
i
come
to
this
would
i
have
the
strength
to
measure
up
to
his
standard
hobart
broke
the
tension
chick
right
there
is
something
in
it
harry
not
all
the
secrets
of
the
universe
have
been
unlocked
by
any
means
now
chick
about
details
have
you
any
data
any
notes
watson
rose
i
could
see
he
was
grateful
you
believe
me
do
you
hobart
it
is
good
i
had
hoped
to
find
someone
and
i
found
you
two
harry
remember
what
i
have
told
you
hold
the
ring
you
take
my
place
whatever
happens
stick
out
to
the
end
you
have
hobart
here
to
help
you
now
just
a
minute
the
library
is
here
you
can
look
over
my
books
i
shall
return
in
a
he
stepped
out
into
the
hall
we
could
hear
his
weary
feet
dragging
down
the
hallway
a
hollow
sound
and
a
bit
uncanny
somehow
my
mind
rambled
back
to
that
account
i
had
read
in
the
newspaper
jerome
story
like
weary
bones
dragging
and
the
old
lady
who
was
she
why
was
everyone
in
this
house
pulled
down
to
exhaustion
the
words
of
the
old
lady
i
could
almost
hear
them
the
dank
air
murmuring
their
recollection
now
there
are
two
now
there
are
two
what
the
matter
harry
perhaps
i
was
frightened
i
do
not
know
i
looked
around
the
sound
of
watson
footsteps
had
died
away
there
was
a
light
in
the
back
of
the
building
coming
toward
us
nothing
only
damn
this
place
hobart
do
you
notice
it
enough
to
eat
your
heart
rather
interesting
said
hobart
it
was
too
interesting
for
me
i
stepped
over
to
the
shelves
and
looked
at
the
titles
sanskrit
and
greek
german
and
french
the
vedas
sir
oliver
lodge
besant
spinoza
a
conglomeration
of
all
ages
and
tongues
a
range
of
metaphysics
that
was
as
wide
as
babel
and
about
as
enlightening
as
babel
over
my
shoulders
came
the
strangest
sound
of
all
weak
piping
tremulous
fearful
now
there
are
two
now
there
are
my
heart
gave
a
fearful
leap
soon
there
will
be
three
soon
i
turned
suddenly
about
i
had
a
fearful
thought
i
looked
at
hobart
a
strange
insidious
fear
clutched
at
me
was
the
thought
intrinsic
if
not
where
had
it
come
from
three
i
strained
my
ears
to
hear
footsteps
he
was
in
the
back
part
of
the
building
i
must
have
some
air
i
going
to
open
the
door
hobart
i
spoke
the
front
door
and
look
out
into
the
do
blame
you
much
feel
a
bit
that
way
myself
about
time
for
higgins
here
comes
chick
again
take
a
look
outside
and
see
if
the
doc
is
i
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
into
the
dripping
fog
bank
what
a
pair
of
fools
we
were
we
both
knew
it
and
we
were
both
seeking
an
excuse
in
the
next
room
through
the
curtains
i
could
see
the
weak
form
of
watson
he
was
bearing
a
light
suddenly
the
light
went
out
i
was
at
high
tension
the
mere
fact
of
the
light
was
nothing
but
it
meant
a
world
at
that
moment
a
strange
sound
a
struggle
then
the
words
of
watson
chick
watson
harry
harry
hobart
harry
come
here
it
the
blind
spot
it
was
in
the
next
room
the
despair
of
that
call
is
unforgettable
like
that
of
one
suddenly
falling
into
space
then
the
light
dropped
to
the
floor
i
could
see
the
outlines
of
his
figure
and
a
weird
single
string
of
incandescence
hobart
turned
and
i
leaped
it
was
a
blur
the
form
of
a
man
melting
into
nothing
i
sprang
into
the
room
tearing
down
the
curtains
hobart
was
on
top
of
me
but
we
were
too
late
i
could
feel
the
vibrancy
of
something
uncanny
as
i
rushed
across
the
space
intervening
through
my
mind
darted
the
thrill
of
terror
it
had
come
suddenly
and
in
climax
it
was
over
before
it
had
commenced
the
light
had
gone
out
only
by
the
gleam
from
the
other
room
could
we
make
out
each
others
faces
the
air
was
vibrant
magnetic
there
was
no
watson
but
we
could
hear
his
voice
dim
and
fearful
coming
down
the
corridors
of
time
hold
that
ring
harry
hold
that
ring
then
the
faint
despair
out
of
the
weary
distance
faint
but
a
whole
volume
the
blind
spot
it
was
over
as
quickly
as
that
the
whole
thing
climaxed
into
an
instant
it
is
difficult
to
describe
one
can
not
always
analyse
sensations
mine
i
am
afraid
were
muddled
a
thousand
insistent
thoughts
clashed
through
my
brain
horror
wonder
doubt
i
have
only
one
persistent
and
predominating
recollection
the
old
lady
i
could
almost
feel
her
coming
out
of
the
shadows
there
was
sadness
and
pity
out
of
the
stillness
and
the
corners
what
had
been
the
dirge
of
her
sorrow
now
there
are
three
x
man
or
phantom
it
was
hobart
who
came
to
first
his
voice
was
good
to
hear
it
was
natural
it
was
sweet
and
human
but
it
was
pregnant
with
disappointment
we
are
fools
harry
we
are
fools
but
i
could
only
stare
i
remember
saying
the
blind
spot
yes
returned
hobart
the
blind
spot
but
what
is
it
we
saw
him
go
did
you
see
it
it
gets
me
i
answered
he
just
vanished
into
space
it
frankly
i
was
afraid
it
tallies
well
with
the
reports
the
old
lady
and
jerome
remember
and
the
bell
i
looked
about
the
room
exactly
phenomena
watson
was
right
i
just
wonder
but
the
bell
remember
the
doctor
greatest
day
since
columbus
no
do
cross
the
room
harry
i
a
bit
leery
a
great
discovery
i
should
say
it
was
how
do
you
account
for
it
fenton
shook
his
head
by
no
means
it
the
gateway
to
the
universe
into
his
eyes
sparkled
my
lord
harry
do
you
see
once
we
control
it
the
blind
spot
what
is
beyond
we
saw
chick
watson
go
before
our
eyes
where
did
he
go
to
it
beats
death
i
started
across
the
room
but
hobart
caught
me
with
both
arms
no
no
no
harry
my
lord
i
do
want
to
lose
you
no
you
foolhardly
little
cuss
stand
back
he
threw
me
violently
against
the
wall
the
impact
quite
took
my
breath
on
the
instant
the
old
rush
of
temper
surged
up
in
me
from
boyhood
we
had
these
moments
hobart
settled
himself
and
awaited
the
rush
that
he
knew
was
coming
in
his
great
calm
brute
strength
there
was
still
a
greatness
of
love
harry
he
was
saying
for
the
love
of
heaven
listen
to
reason
have
we
got
to
have
a
and
on
this
of
all
nights
have
i
got
to
lick
you
again
do
you
want
to
roll
into
the
blind
spot
why
did
god
curse
me
with
such
a
temper
on
such
moments
as
this
i
could
feel
something
within
me
snapping
it
was
fury
and
unreason
how
i
loved
him
and
yet
we
had
fought
a
thousand
times
over
just
such
provocation
over
his
shoulders
i
could
see
the
still
open
door
that
led
into
the
street
a
heavy
form
was
looming
through
the
opening
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
caught
the
lines
of
the
form
stepping
out
of
the
shadows
it
crossed
the
room
and
stood
beside
hobart
fenton
it
was
rhamda
avec
i
leaped
the
fury
of
a
thousand
conflicts
and
the
exultation
for
the
glory
of
such
moments
it
is
well
worth
dying
one
minute
flying
through
the
air
the
old
catapult
tackle
and
the
next
a
crashing
of
bone
and
sinew
we
rolled
over
head
on
and
across
the
floor
curses
and
execrations
the
deep
bass
voice
of
hobart
hold
him
harry
hold
him
that
the
way
hold
him
hold
him
we
went
crashing
about
the
room
he
was
the
slipperiest
thing
i
had
ever
laid
hold
of
but
he
was
bone
bone
and
sinew
he
was
a
man
i
remember
the
wild
thrill
of
exultation
at
the
discovery
it
was
battle
and
death
the
table
went
over
we
went
spinning
against
the
wall
a
crash
of
falling
bookcases
books
and
broken
glass
a
scurry
and
a
flying
heap
of
legs
and
arms
he
was
wonderfully
strong
and
active
like
a
panther
each
time
i
held
him
he
would
twist
out
like
a
cat
straighten
and
throw
me
out
of
hold
i
clung
on
fighting
striving
for
a
grip
working
for
the
throat
he
was
a
man
a
man
i
remembered
that
he
must
never
get
away
he
must
account
for
watson
in
the
first
rush
i
was
a
madman
the
mere
force
of
my
onslaught
had
borne
him
down
but
in
a
moment
he
had
recovered
and
was
fighting
systematically
as
much
as
he
could
he
kept
over
on
one
side
of
me
always
forcing
me
toward
the
inner
room
where
watson
had
disappeared
in
spite
of
my
fury
he
eluded
every
effort
that
i
made
for
a
vital
part
we
rolled
fought
struck
and
struggled
i
could
hear
hobart
bass
thundering
over
over
under
look
out
now
you
got
him
harry
harry
look
out
hold
him
for
the
love
of
heaven
i
see
his
trick
that
his
trick
the
blind
spot
we
were
rolled
clear
over
picked
heaved
shoved
against
the
front
wall
there
were
three
the
great
heaving
bulk
of
fenton
the
fighting
tiger
between
us
and
myself
surely
such
strength
was
not
human
we
could
not
pin
him
his
quickness
was
uncanny
he
would
uncoil
twist
himself
and
throw
us
loose
gradually
he
worked
us
away
from
the
front
wall
and
into
the
centre
of
the
room
could
any
mere
man
fight
so
hobart
was
as
good
as
a
ton
i
was
as
much
for
action
slowly
slowly
in
spite
of
our
efforts
he
was
working
us
towards
the
blind
spot
confident
of
success
he
was
over
around
and
in
and
under
in
a
spin
of
a
second
he
went
into
the
attack
he
fairly
bore
us
off
our
feet
we
were
on
the
last
inch
of
our
line
the
stake
was
what
was
it
we
all
went
down
a
great
volume
of
sound
we
were
inside
a
bell
my
whole
head
buzzed
to
music
and
a
roar
the
whir
of
a
thousand
vibrations
the
inside
of
sound
i
fell
face
downwards
the
room
went
black
what
was
it
how
long
i
lay
there
i
do
know
a
dim
light
was
burning
i
was
in
a
room
the
ceiling
overhead
was
worked
in
a
grotesque
pattern
i
could
not
make
it
out
my
clothes
were
in
tatters
and
my
hand
was
covered
with
blood
something
warm
was
trickling
down
my
face
what
was
it
the
air
was
still
and
sodden
who
was
this
man
beside
me
and
what
was
this
smell
of
roses
i
lay
still
for
a
minute
thinking
ah
yes
it
came
back
watson
chick
watson
the
blind
spot
the
rhamda
and
the
bell
surely
it
was
a
dream
how
could
all
this
be
in
one
short
night
it
was
like
a
nightmare
and
impossible
i
raised
up
on
my
elbow
and
looked
at
the
form
beside
me
it
was
hobart
fenton
he
was
unconscious
for
a
moment
my
mind
was
whirring
i
was
too
weak
and
unsteady
i
dropped
back
and
wondered
absently
at
the
roses
roses
meant
perfume
and
perfume
meant
a
woman
what
could
something
touched
my
face
something
soft
it
plucked
tenderly
at
my
tangled
hair
and
drew
it
away
from
my
forehead
it
was
the
hand
of
a
woman
you
poor
foolish
boy
you
foolish
boy
somewhere
i
had
heard
that
voice
it
held
a
touch
of
sadness
it
was
familiar
it
was
soft
and
silken
like
music
that
might
have
been
woven
out
of
the
moonbeams
who
was
it
that
always
made
me
think
of
moonbeams
i
lay
still
thinking
he
dared
he
dared
he
dared
she
was
saying
as
if
there
were
not
two
he
shall
pay
for
this
am
i
to
be
a
plaything
you
poor
boy
then
i
remembered
i
looked
up
it
was
the
nervina
she
was
stooping
over
with
my
head
against
her
how
beautiful
her
eyes
were
in
their
depths
was
a
pathos
and
a
tenderness
that
was
past
a
woman
the
same
slight
droop
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
and
the
wistfulness
her
features
were
relaxed
like
a
mother
a
wondrous
sweetness
and
pity
harry
she
asked
where
is
watson
did
he
go
i
nodded
into
the
blind
spot
yes
what
is
the
blind
spot
she
ignored
the
question
i
am
sorry
she
answered
so
sorry
i
would
have
saved
him
and
the
rhamda
was
he
here
too
i
nodded
her
eyes
flashed
wickedly
and
and
you
tell
me
did
you
fight
with
the
rhamda
you
it
was
watson
i
interrupted
this
rhamda
is
behind
it
all
he
is
the
villain
he
can
fight
like
a
tiger
whoever
he
is
he
can
she
frowned
slightly
she
shook
her
head
you
young
men
she
said
you
young
men
you
are
all
alike
why
must
it
be
i
am
so
sorry
and
you
fought
with
the
rhamda
you
could
not
overcome
him
of
course
but
tell
me
how
could
you
resist
him
what
did
you
do
what
did
she
mean
i
had
felt
his
flesh
and
muscle
he
was
a
man
why
could
he
not
be
conquered
not
be
resisted
i
do
understand
i
answered
he
is
a
man
i
fought
him
he
was
here
let
him
account
for
watson
we
fought
alone
at
first
until
he
tried
to
throw
me
into
this
thing
then
hobart
stepped
in
once
i
thought
we
had
him
but
he
was
too
slippery
he
came
near
putting
us
both
in
i
do
know
something
happened
a
her
hand
was
on
my
arm
she
clutched
it
tightly
she
swallowed
hard
in
her
eyes
flashed
the
fire
that
i
had
noticed
once
before
the
softness
died
out
and
their
glint
was
almost
terrible
he
the
bell
saved
you
he
would
dare
to
throw
you
into
the
blind
spot
i
lay
back
i
was
terribly
weak
and
uncertain
this
beautiful
woman
what
was
her
interest
in
myself
harry
she
spoke
let
me
ask
you
i
am
your
friend
if
you
only
knew
i
would
save
you
it
must
not
be
will
you
give
me
the
ring
if
i
could
only
tell
you
you
must
not
have
it
it
is
death
yes
worse
than
death
no
man
may
wear
so
that
was
it
again
and
so
soon
i
was
to
be
tempted
was
her
concern
feigned
or
real
why
did
she
call
me
harry
why
did
i
not
resent
it
she
was
wonderful
she
was
beautiful
she
was
pure
was
it
merely
a
subtle
act
for
the
rhamda
i
could
still
hear
watson
voice
ringing
out
of
the
blind
spot
hold
the
ring
hold
the
ring
i
could
not
be
false
to
my
friend
tell
me
first
i
asked
who
is
this
rhamda
what
is
he
is
he
a
man
not
a
man
i
remembered
watson
words
a
phantom
how
could
it
be
at
least
i
would
find
out
what
i
could
then
tell
me
what
is
he
she
smiled
faintly
again
the
elusive
tenderness
lingered
about
her
lips
the
wistful
droop
at
the
corners
that
i
may
not
tell
you
harry
you
could
understand
if
only
i
certainly
i
could
understand
her
evasion
i
studied
and
watched
her
her
wondrous
hair
the
perfection
of
her
throat
the
curve
of
her
bosom
then
he
is
no
not
that
harry
that
would
explain
everything
one
can
not
go
above
nature
he
is
living
just
as
you
i
studied
a
moment
are
you
a
woman
i
asked
suddenly
perhaps
i
should
not
have
asked
it
she
was
so
sad
and
beautiful
somehow
i
could
not
doubt
her
sincerity
there
was
a
burden
at
the
back
of
her
sadness
some
great
yearning
unsatisfied
unattainable
she
dropped
her
head
the
hand
upon
my
arm
quivered
and
clutched
spasmodically
i
caught
the
least
sound
of
a
sob
when
i
looked
up
her
eyes
were
wet
and
sparkling
oh
she
said
harry
why
do
you
ask
it
a
woman
harry
a
woman
to
live
and
love
and
to
be
loved
what
must
it
be
there
is
so
much
of
life
that
is
sweet
and
pure
i
love
it
i
love
it
i
can
have
everything
but
the
most
exalted
thing
of
all
i
can
live
see
enjoy
think
but
i
can
not
have
love
you
knew
it
from
the
first
how
did
you
know
it
you
said
ah
it
is
true
i
am
out
of
the
she
controlled
herself
suddenly
excuse
me
she
said
simply
but
you
can
never
understand
may
i
have
the
ring
it
was
like
a
dream
her
beauty
her
voice
everything
but
i
could
still
hear
watson
i
was
to
be
tempted
cajoled
flattered
what
was
this
story
out
of
the
moonbeams
certainly
she
was
the
most
beautiful
girl
i
had
ever
seen
why
had
i
asked
such
a
question
i
shall
keep
the
ring
i
answered
she
sighed
a
strange
weakness
came
over
me
i
was
drowsy
i
lapsed
again
into
unconsciousness
just
as
i
was
fading
away
i
heard
her
speaking
i
am
so
sorry
xi
baffled
was
it
a
dream
the
next
i
knew
somebody
was
dousing
water
down
my
neck
it
was
hobart
fenton
lord
he
was
saying
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
to
what
hit
us
you
are
pretty
well
cut
up
that
was
some
fight
this
rhamda
who
is
he
can
you
figure
him
out
did
you
hear
that
bell
what
was
it
i
sat
up
where
is
the
nervina
i
asked
the
who
he
was
bewildered
oh
down
at
the
cafe
i
suppose
thought
you
had
forgotten
her
her
mate
enough
it
might
be
healthy
to
forget
his
he
was
a
fine
sight
his
clothes
were
in
ribbons
his
plump
figure
was
breaking
out
at
the
seams
he
regarded
me
critically
what
think
of
the
blind
spot
he
asked
who
is
the
rhamda
he
put
us
out
pretty
but
the
girl
i
interrupted
the
girl
confound
it
the
girl
it
was
sometime
before
i
could
make
him
understand
even
then
he
refused
to
believe
me
it
was
all
a
dream
he
said
all
a
but
i
was
certain
fenton
began
prodding
about
the
room
i
do
not
believe
any
apartment
was
ever
so
thoroughly
ransacked
we
even
tore
up
the
carpet
when
we
were
through
he
sat
in
the
midst
of
the
debris
and
wiped
his
forehead
it
no
use
harry
no
use
we
might
have
known
better
it
ca
be
done
yet
you
say
you
saw
a
string
of
a
single
string
the
form
of
watson
a
blur
then
nothing
i
answered
he
thought
he
quoted
the
professor
of
the
occult
i
shall
bring
you
the
proof
and
the
substance
it
will
be
concrete
within
the
reach
of
your
senses
is
that
what
the
doctor
said
then
you
believe
professor
holcomb
why
not
did
we
see
it
i
know
a
deal
of
material
science
but
nothing
like
this
i
always
had
faith
in
holcomb
after
all
not
impossible
first
we
must
go
over
the
house
we
did
most
of
all
we
were
interested
in
that
bell
we
did
not
think
either
of
us
that
so
much
noise
could
come
out
of
nothing
it
was
too
material
the
other
we
could
credit
to
the
occult
but
not
the
sound
it
had
drowned
our
consciousness
perhaps
it
had
saved
us
from
the
rhamda
but
we
found
nothing
we
went
over
the
house
systematically
it
was
much
as
it
had
been
previously
described
only
now
a
bit
more
furnished
the
same
dank
musty
smell
and
the
same
suggestive
silence
we
returned
to
the
lower
floor
and
the
library
it
was
a
sorry
sight
we
straightened
up
the
shelves
and
returned
the
books
to
their
places
it
was
getting
along
toward
morning
hobart
sailed
at
nine
we
must
have
new
clothing
and
some
coffee
likewise
we
must
collect
our
wits
i
had
the
ring
and
had
given
my
pledge
to
watson
i
was
muddled
we
must
get
down
to
sane
action
first
of
all
we
must
return
to
our
rooms
the
fog
had
grown
thicker
one
could
almost
taste
it
i
suppress
a
shudder
it
was
cold
dank
repressive
neither
of
us
spoke
a
word
on
our
way
downtown
hobart
opened
the
door
to
our
apartment
he
turned
on
the
lights
in
a
few
moments
we
had
hot
steaming
cups
of
coffee
still
we
did
not
speak
hobart
sat
in
his
chair
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
head
between
his
hands
my
thoughts
ran
back
to
that
day
in
college
when
he
said
i
was
just
thinking
harry
if
i
had
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
would
solve
the
blind
that
was
long
ago
we
had
neither
of
us
thought
that
we
would
come
to
the
fact
well
i
spoke
have
you
got
that
hundred
thousand
dollars
you
had
an
idea
he
looked
up
i
got
it
yet
i
am
not
certain
it
is
merely
a
theory
but
it
not
well
what
is
it
he
took
another
drink
of
coffee
and
settled
back
in
his
chair
it
is
energy
harry
force
nothing
but
energy
and
then
it
not
occult
i
asked
certainly
it
is
i
did
say
that
it
is
what
the
professor
promised
something
concrete
for
our
senses
if
the
occult
is
it
can
certainly
be
proven
the
professor
was
right
it
is
energy
force
vibration
it
has
a
law
the
old
doctor
was
caught
somehow
we
must
watch
our
step
and
see
that
we
are
swallowed
up
also
perhaps
we
shall
go
the
way
of
i
shuddered
i
hope
not
but
explain
you
speak
in
volumes
come
back
to
that
easy
harry
i
can
give
you
my
theory
in
a
few
short
words
you
studied
physiology
have
you
well
that
where
you
can
get
your
proof
or
rather
let
me
say
my
theory
what
is
the
blind
spot
in
optics
we
forgo
that
he
answered
i
refer
to
this
i
thought
for
a
moment
well
i
said
i
do
know
it
was
something
i
could
see
watson
went
out
before
our
eyes
he
was
exactly
do
you
get
the
point
it
is
this
what
you
see
is
merely
energy
your
eye
is
merely
a
machine
it
catches
certain
colours
which
in
turn
are
merely
rates
of
vibration
there
is
nothing
to
matter
but
force
harry
if
we
could
get
down
deep
enough
and
know
a
few
laws
we
could
transmute
what
has
it
to
do
with
the
occult
merely
a
fact
the
eye
machine
catches
only
certain
vibration
speeds
of
energy
there
are
undoubtedly
any
number
of
speeds
the
eye
can
not
see
then
this
would
account
for
the
blind
spot
exactly
a
localised
spot
a
condition
a
combination
of
phenomena
anything
entering
it
becomes
where
does
it
go
to
that
it
where
it
one
of
the
things
that
man
has
been
guessing
at
down
the
ages
the
professor
is
the
first
philosopher
with
sound
sense
he
went
after
it
it
a
pity
he
was
by
the
rhamda
who
is
he
hobart
smiled
how
do
i
know
where
did
he
come
from
if
we
knew
that
we
would
know
everything
phantom
so
watson
says
if
so
it
only
strengthens
our
theory
it
would
make
a
man
and
matter
only
a
part
of
creation
certainly
it
would
clear
up
a
lot
of
and
the
ring
it
controls
the
blind
in
what
way
that
for
us
to
find
and
watson
he
is
in
this
land
of
doubt
at
least
he
is
in
the
blind
spot
let
me
try
the
he
struck
a
match
it
was
much
as
it
had
been
in
the
restaurant
only
a
bit
more
startling
then
the
blue
faded
the
colour
went
out
and
it
became
transparent
for
a
moment
there
was
an
effect
of
space
and
distance
that
i
had
not
noted
before
almost
marvellous
if
i
could
describe
it
at
all
i
would
say
a
crystal
corridor
of
a
vastness
that
can
scarcely
be
imagined
it
made
one
dizzy
even
in
that
bit
of
jewel
one
lost
proportion
it
was
height
distance
space
immeasurable
for
an
instant
then
the
whole
thing
blurred
and
clouded
something
passed
across
the
face
the
transparency
turned
to
opaqueness
and
then
two
men
it
was
as
sudden
as
a
flash
the
materialisation
there
was
no
question
they
were
alive
watson
was
with
the
professor
it
was
a
strange
moment
only
an
hour
before
one
of
them
had
been
with
us
it
was
watson
beyond
a
doubt
he
was
alive
one
could
almost
believe
him
in
the
jewel
we
had
heard
his
story
the
screen
of
the
occult
the
curtain
of
we
had
seen
him
go
there
was
an
element
of
horror
in
the
thing
and
of
fascination
the
great
professor
the
faithful
watson
where
had
they
gone
it
was
not
until
the
colour
had
come
back
and
the
blue
had
regained
its
lustre
that
either
of
us
looked
up
could
such
a
thing
be
unravelled
fenton
turned
the
stone
over
thoughtfully
he
shook
his
head
in
that
jewel
harry
lies
the
secret
i
wish
i
knew
a
bit
more
about
physics
light
force
energy
vibration
we
have
got
to
your
theory
it
still
holds
i
thought
let
me
get
it
clear
hobart
you
say
that
we
catch
only
certain
that
it
our
eyes
are
instruments
nothing
else
we
can
see
light
but
we
can
not
hear
it
we
hear
sound
but
we
can
not
see
it
of
course
they
are
not
exactly
parallel
but
it
serves
the
point
let
go
a
bit
further
the
eye
picks
up
certain
vibrations
light
is
nothing
but
energy
vibrating
at
a
tremendous
speed
it
has
to
be
just
so
high
for
the
eye
to
pick
it
up
a
great
deal
we
do
not
get
for
instance
we
can
only
catch
of
the
solar
spectrum
until
recently
we
have
believed
only
what
we
could
see
science
has
pulled
us
out
of
the
rut
it
may
pull
us
through
the
blind
and
hobart
held
up
his
hands
it
is
almost
too
much
to
believe
we
have
made
a
discovery
we
must
watch
our
step
we
must
not
lose
the
work
of
holcomb
shall
not
go
for
and
the
ring
he
consulted
his
watch
we
have
only
a
short
time
left
we
must
map
our
action
we
have
three
things
to
work
on
the
ring
the
house
bertha
holcomb
it
all
up
to
you
harry
find
out
all
that
is
possible
but
go
slow
trace
down
that
ring
find
out
everything
that
you
can
go
and
see
bertha
holcomb
perhaps
she
can
give
you
some
data
watson
said
no
but
perhaps
you
may
uncover
it
take
the
ring
to
a
lapidary
but
do
let
him
cut
it
last
of
all
and
most
important
buy
the
house
of
the
blind
spot
draw
on
me
let
me
pay
half
i
shall
move
into
it
i
answered
he
hesitated
a
bit
i
am
afraid
of
that
he
answered
well
if
you
wish
only
be
careful
remember
i
shall
return
just
as
soon
as
i
can
get
loose
if
you
feel
yourself
slipping
or
anything
happens
send
me
a
the
hours
passed
all
too
quickly
when
day
came
we
had
our
breakfast
and
hurried
down
to
the
pier
it
was
hard
to
have
him
go
his
last
words
were
like
hobart
fenton
he
repeated
the
warning
watch
your
step
harry
watch
your
step
take
things
easy
be
cautious
get
the
house
trace
down
the
ring
be
sure
of
yourself
keep
me
informed
if
you
need
me
cable
i
come
if
i
have
to
his
last
words
and
not
a
year
ago
it
seems
now
like
a
lifetime
as
i
stood
upon
the
pier
and
watched
the
ship
slipping
into
the
water
i
felt
it
coming
upon
me
it
had
grown
steadily
a
gloom
and
oppression
not
to
be
thwarted
it
is
silent
and
subtle
and
past
defining
like
shadow
the
grey
heavy
heave
of
the
water
the
great
hull
of
the
steamer
backing
into
the
bay
the
gloom
of
the
fog
bank
a
few
uncertain
lines
the
shrill
of
the
siren
the
mist
settling
i
was
alone
it
was
isolation
i
had
been
warned
by
watson
but
i
had
not
guessed
at
the
moment
i
sensed
it
it
was
the
beginning
out
of
my
heart
i
could
feel
it
solitude
in
the
great
and
populous
city
i
was
to
be
alone
in
all
its
teeming
life
i
was
to
be
a
stranger
it
has
been
almost
a
year
a
year
it
has
been
a
lifetime
a
breaking
down
of
life
i
have
waited
and
fought
and
sought
to
conquer
one
can
not
fight
against
shadow
it
is
merciless
and
inexorable
there
are
secrets
that
may
be
locked
forever
it
was
my
duty
my
pledge
to
watson
what
i
owed
to
the
professor
i
have
hung
on
grimly
what
the
end
will
be
i
do
not
know
i
have
cabled
for
fenton
xii
a
deal
in
property
but
to
return
there
was
work
that
i
should
do
much
work
if
i
was
going
after
the
solution
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
house
i
turned
my
back
to
the
waterfront
and
entered
the
city
the
streets
were
packed
the
commerce
of
man
jostled
and
threaded
along
the
highways
there
was
life
and
action
hope
ambition
it
was
what
i
had
loved
so
well
yet
now
it
was
different
i
realised
it
vaguely
and
wondered
this
feeling
of
aloofness
it
was
intrinsic
coming
from
within
like
the
withering
of
one
marrow
i
laughed
at
my
foreboding
it
was
not
natural
i
tried
to
shake
myself
together
i
had
no
difficulty
with
the
records
in
less
than
an
hour
i
traced
out
the
owners
an
estate
and
had
located
the
agent
it
just
so
happened
that
he
was
a
man
with
whom
i
had
some
acquaintance
we
were
not
long
in
coming
to
business
the
house
at
no
chatterton
place
i
noticed
that
he
was
startled
there
was
a
bit
of
wonder
in
his
look
a
quizzical
alertness
he
motioned
me
to
a
chair
and
closed
the
door
sit
down
wendel
sit
down
the
house
at
no
chatterton
place
did
i
hear
you
right
again
i
noted
the
wonder
his
manner
was
cautious
and
curious
i
nodded
want
to
buy
it
or
just
lease
it
pardon
me
but
you
are
sort
of
a
friend
i
would
not
like
to
lose
your
friendship
for
the
sake
of
a
mere
sale
what
is
your
just
for
a
residence
i
insisted
a
place
to
live
i
see
know
anything
about
this
place
do
you
he
fumbled
with
some
papers
for
an
agent
he
did
not
strike
me
as
being
very
solicitous
for
a
commission
well
he
said
in
a
way
yes
a
whole
lot
more
than
i
like
to
it
all
depends
one
gets
much
from
hearsay
what
i
know
is
mostly
he
began
marking
with
a
pencil
of
course
i
do
believe
it
nevertheless
i
would
hardly
recommend
it
to
a
friend
as
a
and
these
rumours
he
looked
up
for
a
moment
he
studied
then
ever
hear
of
the
blind
spot
perhaps
you
remember
holcomb
in
before
the
it
was
a
murder
the
papers
were
full
of
it
at
the
time
since
then
it
has
been
occasionally
featured
in
the
supplements
i
do
not
believe
in
the
story
but
i
can
trust
to
facts
the
last
seen
of
holcomb
was
in
this
house
it
is
called
the
blind
then
you
believe
in
the
story
i
asked
he
looked
at
me
oh
you
know
it
eh
no
i
do
not
it
all
bunkum
reporters
work
and
exaggeration
if
you
like
that
kind
of
stuff
it
weird
and
interesting
but
it
hurts
property
the
man
was
undoubtedly
murdered
the
tale
hangs
over
the
house
it
impossible
to
dispose
of
the
then
why
not
sell
it
to
me
he
dropped
his
pencil
he
was
a
bit
nervous
a
fair
question
wendel
a
very
fair
question
well
now
why
i
perhaps
i
shall
there
no
telling
but
i
rather
not
do
you
know
a
year
ago
i
would
have
jumped
at
an
offer
fact
is
i
did
lease
it
the
lease
ran
out
yesterday
to
a
man
named
watson
i
do
believe
a
thing
in
this
nonsense
but
what
i
have
seen
during
the
past
year
has
tested
my
nerve
what
about
watson
watson
a
year
ago
he
came
to
see
me
in
regard
to
this
chatterton
property
wanted
to
lease
it
was
interested
in
the
case
of
holcomb
asked
for
a
year
rental
and
the
privilege
of
renewal
i
do
know
i
gave
it
to
him
but
when
he
drops
in
again
i
am
going
to
fight
almighty
hard
against
letting
him
hold
it
why
why
why
because
i
do
believe
in
murder
a
year
ago
he
came
to
me
the
healthiest
and
happiest
man
i
ever
saw
today
he
is
a
shadow
i
watched
that
boy
go
down
understand
i
do
believe
a
damn
word
saying
but
i
have
seen
it
it
that
cursed
house
i
say
no
when
i
reason
but
it
keeps
on
my
nerves
it
on
my
conscience
it
is
insidious
every
month
when
he
came
here
i
could
see
disintegration
it
pitiful
to
see
a
young
man
stripped
of
life
like
that
forlorn
hopeless
gone
he
has
never
told
me
what
it
is
but
i
have
wondered
a
battle
some
conflict
with
there
i
go
again
it
on
my
nerves
i
tell
you
on
my
nerves
if
this
keeps
up
i
burn
it
was
a
bit
foreboding
already
i
could
feel
the
tugging
at
my
heart
that
had
done
for
watson
this
man
had
watched
my
friend
slipping
into
the
shadow
i
had
come
to
take
his
place
watson
has
gone
i
said
simply
and
that
why
i
am
he
straightened
up
you
know
him
then
he
was
not
he
went
last
night
he
has
left
the
country
he
was
in
very
poor
health
that
why
i
am
here
i
know
very
well
the
cloud
that
hangs
over
the
property
it
is
my
sole
reason
for
you
do
believe
in
this
nonsense
i
smiled
certainly
the
man
was
perverse
in
his
agnosticism
he
was
stubborn
in
disbelief
it
was
on
his
nerves
on
his
conscience
he
was
afraid
i
believe
nothing
i
answered
neither
do
i
disbelieve
i
know
all
the
story
that
has
been
told
or
written
i
am
a
friend
of
watson
you
need
not
scruple
in
making
me
out
a
bill
of
sale
it
my
own
funeral
i
abide
by
the
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
after
all
he
was
human
he
had
honour
but
it
was
after
the
brand
of
pontius
pilate
he
wished
nothing
on
his
conscience
armed
with
the
keys
and
the
legal
title
i
took
possession
in
the
daylight
it
was
much
as
it
had
been
the
night
before
once
across
its
threshold
one
was
in
dank
and
furtive
suppression
the
air
was
heavy
a
mould
of
age
had
streaked
the
walls
and
gloomed
the
shadows
i
put
up
all
the
curtains
to
let
in
the
rush
of
sunlight
likewise
i
opened
the
windows
if
there
is
anything
to
beat
down
sin
it
is
the
open
measure
of
broad
daylight
the
house
was
well
situated
from
the
front
windows
one
could
look
down
the
street
and
out
at
the
blue
bay
beyond
the
city
the
fog
had
lifted
and
the
sun
was
shining
upon
the
water
i
could
make
out
the
ferryboats
the
islands
and
the
long
piers
that
lead
to
oakland
and
still
farther
beyond
the
hills
of
berkeley
it
was
a
long
time
since
those
days
in
college
under
the
shadow
of
those
hills
i
had
first
met
the
old
doctor
i
was
only
a
boy
then
i
turned
into
the
building
even
the
sound
of
my
footsteps
was
foreign
the
whole
place
was
pregnant
with
stillness
and
shadow
life
was
gone
out
it
was
fearful
i
felt
the
terror
clutching
upon
me
a
grimness
that
may
not
be
spoken
there
was
something
breaking
within
me
i
had
pledged
myself
for
a
year
frankly
i
was
afraid
but
i
had
given
my
word
i
returned
to
my
apartments
and
began
that
very
day
the
closing
down
of
my
practice
in
a
fortnight
i
had
completed
everything
and
had
moved
my
things
to
the
room
of
chick
watson
xiii
albert
jerome
just
as
soon
as
possible
i
hurried
over
to
berkeley
i
went
straight
to
the
bungalow
on
dwight
way
i
inquired
for
miss
holcomb
she
was
a
woman
now
in
her
late
twenties
decidedly
pretty
a
blonde
and
of
intelligent
bearing
coming
on
such
an
errand
i
was
at
a
loss
just
how
to
approach
her
i
noted
the
little
lines
about
the
corners
of
her
eyes
the
sad
droop
of
her
pretty
mouth
plainly
she
was
worried
as
i
was
removing
my
hat
she
caught
sight
of
the
ring
upon
my
finger
oh
she
said
then
you
come
from
watson
how
is
chick
mr
watson
i
did
not
like
lying
but
i
could
not
but
feel
for
her
she
had
already
lost
her
father
mr
watson
has
gone
on
a
trip
with
jerome
he
was
not
feeling
well
he
has
left
this
ring
with
me
i
have
come
for
a
bit
of
she
bit
her
lips
her
mouth
quivered
could
you
get
this
from
watson
he
knows
about
the
stone
he
tell
you
how
did
it
come
into
your
possession
what
has
happened
her
voice
was
querulous
and
suspicious
i
had
endeavoured
to
deceive
her
for
her
own
sake
she
had
suffered
enough
already
i
could
not
but
wince
at
the
pain
in
her
eyes
she
stood
up
please
wendel
do
be
clumsy
do
regard
me
as
a
mere
baby
tell
me
what
has
happened
to
chick
please
she
stopped
in
a
flow
of
emotion
tears
came
to
her
eyes
but
she
held
control
she
sat
down
tell
me
all
wendel
it
is
what
i
she
blinked
to
hold
back
her
tears
it
is
my
fault
you
would
have
the
ring
had
nothing
happened
tell
me
i
can
be
and
brave
she
was
splendid
with
the
tug
at
my
own
heart
i
could
understand
her
what
uncertainty
and
dread
she
must
have
been
under
i
had
been
in
it
but
a
few
days
already
i
could
feel
the
weight
at
no
time
could
i
surmount
the
isolation
there
was
something
going
from
me
minute
by
minute
with
the
girl
there
could
be
no
evasion
it
were
better
that
she
have
the
truth
i
made
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
affair
and
he
told
you
no
more
about
the
ring
that
is
all
i
answered
he
would
have
told
us
much
more
undoubtedly
had
he
not
you
saw
him
go
you
saw
this
thing
that
is
just
it
miss
holcomb
we
saw
nothing
one
minute
we
were
looking
at
chick
and
the
next
at
nothing
hobart
understood
it
better
than
i
at
least
he
forbade
my
crossing
the
room
there
is
a
danger
point
a
spot
that
may
not
be
crossed
he
threw
me
back
it
was
then
that
the
rhamda
came
upon
the
she
frowned
slightly
tell
me
about
the
nervina
when
chick
spoke
of
her
i
could
always
feel
jealous
is
she
beautiful
most
beautiful
the
most
wonderful
girl
i
have
ever
seen
though
i
would
hardly
class
her
as
one
to
be
jealous
of
but
she
wants
the
ring
i
promised
watson
and
of
course
i
shall
keep
it
but
i
would
like
its
i
think
i
can
give
you
some
information
there
she
answered
the
ring
or
rather
the
jewel
was
given
to
father
about
twenty
years
ago
by
a
kennedy
he
had
been
a
pupil
of
father
when
father
taught
at
a
local
school
he
came
here
often
to
talk
over
old
times
father
had
the
jewel
set
in
a
ring
but
he
never
wore
why
i
do
not
how
did
watson
come
to
link
it
up
with
the
blind
spot
that
i
think
was
an
accident
he
was
in
college
you
know
at
the
time
of
father
disappearance
in
fact
he
was
in
the
ethics
class
he
came
here
often
and
during
one
of
his
visits
i
showed
him
the
ring
that
was
several
years
i
well
about
a
year
ago
he
was
here
again
and
asked
to
see
the
jewel
we
were
to
be
married
you
understand
but
i
had
always
put
it
off
because
of
father
somehow
i
felt
that
he
would
return
it
was
in
late
summer
about
september
it
was
in
the
evening
it
was
getting
dark
i
gave
chick
the
ring
and
stepped
into
the
garden
to
cut
some
flowers
i
remember
that
chick
struck
a
match
in
the
parlour
when
i
came
back
he
seemed
to
be
did
he
ask
you
for
the
ring
yes
he
wanted
to
wear
it
and
he
suddenly
began
to
talk
of
father
it
was
that
night
that
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
find
i
see
not
before
that
night
did
he
take
the
ring
then
yes
we
went
to
the
opera
i
remember
it
well
because
that
night
was
the
first
time
i
ever
knew
chick
to
be
ah
yes
you
know
how
jolly
he
always
was
when
we
returned
that
night
he
would
scarcely
say
a
word
i
thought
he
was
sick
but
he
said
he
was
not
said
he
just
felt
that
i
understand
and
he
kept
getting
glummer
did
you
suspect
the
jewel
did
he
ever
tell
you
anything
she
shook
her
head
no
he
told
me
nothing
except
that
he
would
find
father
of
course
i
became
excited
and
wanted
to
know
but
he
insisted
that
i
could
help
that
he
had
a
clue
and
that
it
might
take
time
from
that
night
i
saw
very
little
of
him
he
leased
the
house
on
chatterton
place
he
seemed
to
lose
interest
in
myself
when
he
did
come
over
he
would
act
queerly
he
talked
incoherently
and
would
often
make
rambling
mention
of
a
beautiful
girl
called
nervina
you
say
it
is
the
ring
tell
me
wendel
what
is
it
has
it
really
anything
to
do
with
father
i
nodded
i
think
it
has
miss
holcomb
and
i
can
understand
poor
chick
he
is
a
very
brave
man
it
a
strange
jewel
and
of
terrible
potency
that
much
i
know
it
devitalises
it
destroys
i
can
feel
it
already
it
covers
life
with
a
fog
of
decay
the
same
solitude
has
come
upon
myself
nevertheless
i
am
certain
it
has
much
to
do
with
the
blind
spot
it
is
a
key
of
some
sort
the
very
interest
of
the
rhamda
and
the
nervina
tells
us
that
i
think
it
was
through
this
stone
that
your
father
made
his
she
thought
a
moment
had
you
better
return
it
while
you
still
have
health
if
you
keep
it
it
will
be
only
one
you
forget
miss
holcomb
my
promise
to
chick
i
loved
your
father
and
i
was
fond
of
watson
it
a
great
secret
and
if
the
professor
is
right
one
which
man
has
sought
through
the
ages
i
be
a
coward
to
forgo
my
duty
if
i
fail
i
have
another
to
take
my
oh
she
said
it
horrible
first
father
then
chick
now
you
and
afterwards
it
will
be
it
is
our
duty
i
returned
one
by
one
though
we
may
fail
each
one
of
us
may
pass
a
bit
more
on
to
his
successor
in
the
end
we
win
it
is
the
way
of
i
had
my
way
she
turned
over
all
the
data
and
notes
that
had
been
left
by
the
professor
but
i
never
found
a
thing
in
them
that
could
be
construed
to
an
advantage
my
real
quest
was
to
trace
down
the
jewel
the
man
kennedy
full
name
was
i
learned
budge
kennedy
he
had
lived
in
oakland
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
i
parted
with
miss
holcomb
and
started
for
the
city
i
remember
it
well
because
of
a
little
incident
that
occurred
immediately
after
our
parting
i
was
just
going
down
the
steps
when
i
looked
up
one
of
the
side
streets
a
few
students
were
loitering
here
and
there
but
there
was
one
who
was
not
a
student
i
recognised
him
instantly
and
i
wondered
it
was
the
rhamda
this
was
enough
to
make
me
suspicious
but
there
was
one
thing
more
farther
up
the
street
was
another
figure
when
i
came
down
the
steps
the
rhamda
moved
and
his
move
was
somehow
duplicated
by
the
other
in
itself
this
was
enough
to
clear
up
some
of
my
doubts
concerning
the
phantom
his
actions
were
too
simple
for
an
apparition
only
a
man
would
act
like
that
and
a
crude
one
i
know
then
the
nerve
of
the
rhamda
there
was
no
doubt
that
i
was
being
shadowed
to
make
certain
i
took
the
and
meandered
by
a
devious
route
to
the
station
there
was
no
question
one
and
two
they
followed
i
knew
the
rhamda
but
who
was
the
other
at
the
station
we
purchased
tickets
and
when
the
train
pulled
in
i
boarded
a
smoker
the
other
two
took
another
coach
the
stranger
was
a
individual
with
a
stubby
grey
moustache
on
the
boat
i
see
them
but
at
the
ferry
building
i
made
a
test
to
see
that
i
was
followed
i
hailed
a
taxi
and
gave
specific
instructions
to
the
driver
drive
slowly
i
told
him
i
think
we
shall
be
and
i
was
right
in
a
few
minutes
there
were
two
cars
dogging
our
i
had
no
doubt
concerning
the
rhamda
but
i
understand
the
other
at
no
chatterton
place
we
stopped
and
i
alighted
the
rhamda
car
passed
then
the
other
neither
stopped
both
disappeared
round
the
corner
i
took
the
numbers
then
i
went
into
the
house
in
about
a
half
hour
a
car
drew
up
at
the
curb
i
stepped
to
the
window
it
was
the
car
that
had
tracked
the
rhamda
the
stubby
individual
stepped
out
without
ceremony
he
ran
up
the
steps
and
opened
the
door
it
was
a
bit
disconcerting
i
think
for
both
he
was
plain
and
blunt
and
honest
well
he
said
where
watson
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
that
i
answered
is
a
question
for
both
of
us
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
where
is
watson
just
then
his
eyes
dropped
and
his
glance
fell
and
eyes
widened
my
name
is
jerome
he
said
simply
has
something
happened
to
watson
who
are
you
we
were
standing
in
the
library
i
made
an
indication
towards
the
other
room
in
there
i
said
my
name
is
he
took
off
his
hat
and
ran
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
forehead
so
that
pair
got
him
too
i
was
afraid
of
them
all
the
while
and
i
had
to
be
away
do
you
know
how
they
did
it
what
the
working
of
their
game
it
devilish
and
certainly
clever
they
played
that
boy
for
a
year
they
knew
they
would
get
him
in
the
end
so
did
i
he
was
a
fine
lad
a
fine
lad
i
knew
this
morning
when
i
came
down
from
nevada
that
they
had
him
found
your
duds
a
stranger
house
looked
queer
but
i
had
hopes
he
might
have
gone
over
to
see
his
girl
just
thought
i
wander
over
to
berkeley
found
that
bird
rhamda
under
a
palm
tree
watching
the
holcomb
bungalow
it
was
the
first
time
i
seen
him
since
that
day
things
went
amiss
with
the
professor
in
about
ten
minutes
you
came
out
i
stayed
with
him
while
he
tracked
you
back
here
i
followed
him
back
down
town
and
lost
him
tell
me
about
he
sat
down
during
my
recital
he
spoke
not
a
word
he
consumed
one
cigar
after
another
when
i
stopped
for
a
moment
he
merely
nodded
his
head
and
waited
until
i
continued
he
was
sturdy
and
frank
of
an
iron
way
and
vast
common
sense
i
liked
him
when
i
had
finished
he
remained
silent
his
grief
was
of
a
solid
kind
he
had
liked
poor
watson
i
see
he
said
it
is
as
i
thought
he
told
you
more
than
he
ever
told
he
never
told
you
not
much
he
was
a
strange
lad
about
the
loneliest
one
i
ever
seen
there
was
something
about
him
from
the
very
first
that
was
not
natural
i
could
make
him
out
you
say
it
is
the
ring
he
always
wore
it
i
laid
it
to
this
rhamda
he
was
always
meeting
him
i
could
never
understand
it
try
as
i
would
i
could
not
get
a
trace
of
the
the
phantom
most
assuredly
would
you
call
him
human
his
grey
eyes
were
flecked
with
light
come
now
wendel
would
you
well
i
answered
i
do
know
not
after
what
i
have
seen
but
for
all
that
i
have
proof
of
his
sinews
i
am
inclined
to
blend
the
two
there
is
a
law
somewhere
a
very
natural
one
the
blind
spot
is
undoubtedly
a
combination
of
phenomena
it
has
a
control
we
do
not
know
what
it
is
or
where
it
leads
to
neither
do
we
know
the
motive
of
the
rhamda
who
is
he
if
we
knew
that
we
would
know
and
this
ring
i
shall
wear
then
god
help
you
i
watched
watson
it
plain
poison
you
have
a
year
but
you
had
better
count
on
half
a
year
the
first
six
months
are
so
bad
but
the
last
it
takes
a
man
wendel
it
takes
a
man
already
you
eating
your
heart
out
oh
i
know
you
have
opened
the
windows
you
want
sunshine
and
air
in
six
months
i
shall
have
to
fight
to
get
one
open
it
gets
into
the
soul
it
is
stagnation
you
die
by
inches
better
give
me
the
this
budge
kennedy
i
evaded
we
must
find
him
we
have
time
one
clue
may
lead
us
on
tell
me
what
you
know
of
the
blind
very
easy
he
answered
you
have
it
all
i
have
been
here
a
number
of
years
you
will
remember
i
fell
into
the
case
through
intuition
i
never
had
any
definite
proof
outside
the
professor
disappearance
the
old
lady
and
that
bell
unless
perhaps
it
is
the
rhamda
but
from
the
beginning
i
been
positive
taking
that
lecture
in
ethics
as
a
starter
i
built
up
my
theory
all
the
clues
lead
to
this
building
it
something
that
i
can
not
understand
it
out
of
the
occult
it
a
bit
too
much
for
me
i
moved
into
the
place
and
waited
i
never
forgotten
that
bell
nor
that
old
lady
you
and
fenton
are
the
only
ones
who
have
seen
the
blind
i
had
a
sudden
thought
the
rhamda
i
have
read
that
he
has
the
manner
of
inherent
goodness
is
it
true
you
have
conversed
with
him
i
he
has
he
did
strike
me
as
a
villain
he
intrinsic
noble
out
of
self
i
have
often
i
smiled
perhaps
we
are
thinking
the
same
thing
is
this
it
the
blind
spot
is
a
secret
that
man
may
not
attain
to
it
is
unknowable
and
akin
to
death
the
rhamda
knows
it
he
could
head
off
the
professor
he
simply
employed
holcomb
wisdom
to
trap
him
now
that
he
has
him
secure
he
intends
to
hold
him
it
is
for
our
own
exactly
yet
yet
he
was
very
anxious
to
put
you
and
fenton
into
this
very
that
is
so
but
may
it
not
be
that
we
too
knew
a
bit
too
much
he
could
answer
that
nevertheless
we
were
both
of
us
convinced
concerning
the
rhamda
it
was
merely
a
digression
of
thought
a
conjecture
he
might
be
good
but
we
were
both
positive
of
his
villainy
it
was
his
motive
of
course
that
weighed
up
his
character
could
we
find
that
we
would
uncover
everything
xiv
a
new
element
budge
kennedy
was
not
so
easily
found
there
were
many
kennedys
about
of
ireland
had
apparently
migrated
to
san
francisco
under
that
name
and
had
lodged
in
the
directory
we
went
through
the
lists
on
both
sides
of
the
bay
but
found
nothing
the
old
directories
had
mostly
been
destroyed
by
fire
or
had
been
thrown
away
as
worthless
but
at
last
we
unearthed
one
in
it
we
found
the
name
of
budge
kennedy
he
had
two
sons
patrick
and
henry
one
of
these
henry
we
ran
down
in
the
mission
he
was
a
great
irishman
he
was
just
eating
supper
when
we
called
there
were
splotches
of
white
plaster
on
his
trousers
i
came
right
to
the
point
do
you
know
anything
about
this
i
held
out
the
ring
he
took
it
in
his
fingers
his
eyes
popped
what
that
well
i
guess
i
do
where
you
get
it
he
called
out
to
the
kitchen
say
mollie
come
here
here
the
old
man
jool
he
looked
at
me
a
bit
fearfully
you
are
wearing
it
why
not
i
asked
why
well
i
do
know
exactly
i
would
wear
it
for
a
million
dollars
it
ai
a
jool
it
a
piece
of
the
divil
the
old
man
gave
it
to
holcomb
or
sold
it
i
do
know
which
he
carried
it
in
his
pocket
once
and
he
came
near
unlucky
i
asked
no
it
ai
unlucky
it
just
rips
your
heart
out
it
would
make
you
hate
your
grandmother
lonesome
lonesome
i
often
heard
the
old
man
he
sold
it
to
holcomb
do
you
know
why
well
yes
was
that
the
old
doc
had
some
scientific
work
dad
told
him
about
his
jool
one
day
he
took
it
over
to
berkeley
it
was
some
kind
of
thing
that
the
professor
just
wanted
he
kept
it
dad
made
him
promise
not
to
wear
i
see
did
your
father
ever
tell
you
where
he
got
it
oh
yes
he
often
spoke
about
that
the
old
man
was
a
plasterer
you
know
just
a
labourer
he
was
digging
a
basement
it
was
a
funny
basement
a
sort
of
blind
cellar
there
was
a
stone
wall
right
across
the
middle
and
then
there
was
a
door
of
wood
to
look
like
stone
you
can
go
down
into
the
back
cellar
but
not
into
the
front
if
you
know
about
the
door
you
never
find
it
dad
often
spoke
about
that
he
was
working
in
the
back
cellar
when
he
found
this
was
sticking
in
some
blue
where
was
this
place
do
you
remember
sure
was
in
chatterton
place
pat
and
i
was
kids
then
we
took
the
old
man
do
you
know
the
number
it
did
have
no
number
but
i
know
the
place
is
a
house
and
was
built
in
i
nodded
and
afterwards
you
moved
to
oakland
did
your
father
ever
speak
of
the
reason
for
this
partition
in
the
cellar
he
never
knew
of
one
it
was
none
of
his
business
he
was
merely
a
labourer
and
did
what
he
was
paid
do
you
know
who
built
it
some
old
guy
he
was
a
cranky
cuss
with
he
used
to
wear
a
hat
i
think
he
was
a
chemist
whenever
he
showed
up
he
would
run
us
kids
out
of
the
building
i
think
he
was
a
this
was
all
the
information
he
could
give
but
it
was
a
great
deal
certainly
it
was
more
than
i
had
hoped
for
the
house
had
been
built
by
a
chemist
even
in
the
construction
there
was
mystery
i
had
never
thought
of
a
second
cellar
when
i
had
explored
the
building
i
had
taken
the
stone
wall
for
granted
it
was
so
with
jerome
it
was
the
first
definite
clue
that
really
brought
us
down
to
earth
what
had
this
chemist
to
do
with
the
phenomena
after
all
behind
everything
was
lurking
the
mind
of
man
we
hastened
back
to
the
house
and
into
the
cellar
by
merely
sounding
along
the
wall
we
discovered
the
door
it
was
cleverly
constructed
and
for
a
time
defied
our
efforts
but
jerome
got
it
open
by
means
of
a
jemmy
and
a
pick
the
outside
was
a
clever
piece
of
sham
work
shaped
like
stone
and
smeared
over
with
cement
in
the
dim
light
we
had
missed
it
we
had
high
expectations
but
we
were
disappointed
the
space
contained
nothing
it
was
smeared
with
cobwebs
and
hairy
mould
but
outside
of
a
few
empty
bottles
and
the
gloomy
darkness
there
was
nothing
we
tapped
the
walls
and
floor
and
ceiling
beyond
all
doubt
the
place
once
held
a
secret
if
it
held
it
still
it
was
cleverly
hidden
after
an
hour
or
two
of
search
we
returned
to
the
upper
part
of
the
building
jerome
was
not
discouraged
we
on
the
right
track
wendel
if
we
can
only
get
started
i
have
an
idea
the
chemist
it
was
in
that
more
than
twenty
what
is
your
idea
the
rhamda
what
is
the
first
thing
that
strikes
you
his
age
with
everyone
that
sees
him
it
the
same
at
first
you
take
him
for
an
old
man
if
you
study
him
long
enough
you
are
positive
that
he
is
in
his
twenties
may
he
not
be
this
chemist
what
becomes
of
the
doctor
and
his
blind
spot
the
blind
spot
answered
jerome
is
merely
a
part
of
the
next
day
i
hunted
up
a
jeweller
i
was
careful
to
choose
one
with
whom
i
was
acquainted
i
asked
for
a
private
consultation
when
we
were
alone
i
took
the
ring
from
my
finger
just
an
opinion
i
asked
you
know
gems
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
this
one
he
picked
it
up
casually
and
turned
it
over
his
mouth
puckered
for
a
minute
he
studied
that
well
he
held
it
up
humph
wait
a
is
it
a
gem
i
think
it
is
at
first
i
thought
i
knew
it
right
off
but
now
wait
a
he
reached
in
the
drawer
for
his
glass
he
held
the
stone
up
for
some
minutes
his
face
was
a
study
queer
little
wrinkles
twisting
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
told
his
wonder
he
did
not
speak
merely
turned
the
stone
round
and
round
at
last
he
removed
his
glass
and
held
up
the
ring
he
was
quizzical
where
did
you
get
this
he
asked
that
is
something
i
do
not
care
to
answer
i
wish
to
know
what
it
is
is
it
a
gem
if
so
what
kind
he
thought
a
moment
and
shook
his
head
i
thought
i
knew
every
gem
on
earth
but
i
do
this
is
a
new
one
it
is
beautiful
just
a
he
stepped
to
the
door
in
a
moment
another
man
stepped
in
the
jeweller
motioned
towards
the
ring
the
man
picked
it
up
and
again
came
the
examination
at
last
he
laid
the
glass
and
ring
both
upon
the
table
what
do
you
make
of
it
henry
asked
the
jeweller
not
me
answered
the
second
one
i
never
saw
one
like
it
was
as
watson
had
said
no
man
had
ever
identified
the
jewel
the
two
men
were
puzzled
they
were
interested
the
jeweller
turned
to
me
would
you
care
to
leave
it
with
us
for
a
bit
you
have
no
objection
to
us
taking
it
out
of
the
ring
i
had
not
thought
of
that
i
had
business
down
the
street
i
consulted
my
watch
in
half
an
hour
i
shall
be
back
will
that
be
enough
time
i
think
it
was
an
hour
before
i
returned
the
assistant
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
office
he
spoke
something
to
the
one
inside
and
then
made
an
indication
to
myself
he
seemed
excited
when
i
came
closer
i
noted
that
his
face
was
full
of
wonder
we
been
waiting
said
he
we
did
examine
the
stone
it
necessary
it
is
truly
he
was
a
short
squat
man
with
a
massive
forehead
just
step
inside
the
office
the
jeweller
was
sitting
beside
a
table
he
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
had
his
hands
clasped
over
his
stomach
he
was
gazing
toward
the
ceiling
his
face
was
a
study
full
of
wonder
and
speculation
well
i
asked
for
an
answer
he
merely
raised
his
finger
pointed
towards
the
ceiling
up
there
he
spoke
your
jewel
or
whatever
it
is
a
good
thing
we
were
in
open
air
be
going
i
looked
up
sure
enough
against
the
ceiling
was
the
gem
it
was
a
bit
disconcerting
though
i
will
confess
that
in
the
first
moment
i
did
not
catch
the
full
significance
the
jeweller
closed
one
eye
and
studied
first
myself
and
then
the
beautiful
thing
against
the
ceiling
what
do
you
make
of
it
he
asked
really
i
had
not
made
anything
it
was
a
bit
of
a
shock
i
grasped
the
full
impossibility
i
did
answer
do
you
see
wendel
impossible
contrary
to
nature
lighter
than
air
we
took
it
out
of
the
ring
and
it
shot
out
like
a
bullet
thought
i
dropped
it
began
looking
on
the
floor
could
find
it
looked
up
and
saw
reynolds
here
with
his
eyes
popping
out
like
marbles
he
was
looking
at
the
i
thought
for
a
moment
then
it
is
not
a
gem
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
not
if
i
a
jeweller
whoever
heard
of
a
stone
without
weight
it
has
no
gravity
that
is
apparently
i
doubt
whether
it
is
a
substance
i
do
know
what
it
it
was
puzzling
i
would
have
given
a
good
deal
just
then
for
a
few
words
with
holcomb
the
man
kennedy
had
kept
it
in
his
pocket
how
had
he
held
it
a
prisoner
the
professor
had
use
for
it
in
some
scientific
work
no
wonder
certainly
it
was
not
a
jewel
what
could
it
be
it
was
solid
it
was
lighter
than
air
could
it
be
a
substance
if
not
what
is
it
what
would
you
advise
in
answer
the
jeweller
reached
for
the
telephone
he
gave
a
number
hello
say
is
ed
there
this
is
phil
tell
him
to
step
to
the
phone
hello
say
ed
i
want
you
to
come
over
on
the
jump
something
to
show
you
too
busy
no
you
not
not
for
this
i
going
to
teach
you
some
chemistry
no
this
is
serious
what
is
it
i
do
know
what
lighter
than
air
lots
of
things
oh
i
know
but
what
solid
that
why
asking
come
over
all
right
at
he
hung
up
the
receiver
my
brother
he
spoke
it
has
passed
beyond
my
province
and
into
his
he
is
a
chemist
as
an
expert
he
may
give
you
a
real
surely
we
needed
one
it
was
against
reason
it
had
taken
me
completely
off
my
balance
i
took
a
chair
and
joined
the
others
in
the
contemplation
of
the
blue
dot
on
the
ceiling
we
could
speculate
and
conjecture
but
there
was
not
one
of
us
deep
enough
even
to
start
a
theory
plainly
it
was
what
should
not
be
we
had
been
taught
physics
and
science
we
had
been
drilled
to
fundamentals
if
this
thing
could
be
then
the
foundations
upon
which
we
stood
were
shattered
but
one
little
law
back
in
my
mind
was
buzzing
the
enigma
of
the
blind
spot
they
were
woven
together
some
law
that
had
eluded
the
ken
of
mankind
the
chemist
was
a
tall
man
with
a
hook
nose
and
black
eyes
that
clinched
like
rivets
he
was
a
bit
impatient
he
looked
keenly
at
his
brother
well
phil
what
is
it
he
pulled
out
a
watch
i
have
much
there
was
a
contrast
between
them
the
jeweller
was
fat
and
complacent
he
merely
sat
in
his
chair
his
hand
on
his
waistband
and
a
stubby
finger
elevated
toward
the
jewel
he
seemed
to
enjoy
it
you
a
chemist
ed
here
a
test
for
your
wisdom
can
you
explain
that
no
over
here
above
your
head
that
jewel
the
other
looked
up
what
the
idea
new
notion
for
decoration
or
a
bit
testily
is
this
a
joke
he
was
a
serious
man
his
black
eyes
and
the
nose
spoke
his
character
the
jeweller
laughed
gently
listen
ed
then
he
went
into
explanation
when
he
was
through
the
chemist
was
twitching
with
excitement
get
me
a
ladder
here
let
me
get
on
the
table
perhaps
i
can
reach
it
sounds
impossible
but
if
it
so
it
so
it
must
have
an
without
ado
and
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
his
brother
he
stepped
upon
the
polished
surface
of
the
table
he
was
a
tall
man
he
could
just
barely
reach
it
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
he
could
move
it
but
each
time
it
clung
as
to
a
magnet
after
a
minute
of
effort
he
gave
it
up
when
he
looked
down
he
was
a
different
man
his
black
eyes
glowed
with
wonder
ca
make
it
he
said
get
a
strange
with
the
ladder
it
was
easy
he
plucked
it
off
the
ceiling
we
pressed
about
the
table
the
chemist
turned
it
about
with
his
fingers
i
wonder
he
was
saying
it
a
gem
apparently
you
say
it
has
no
gravity
it
ca
be
whoop
he
let
it
slip
out
of
his
fingers
again
it
popped
on
its
way
to
the
ceiling
he
caught
it
with
a
deft
movement
of
his
hand
the
devil
did
you
ever
see
and
a
solid
who
owns
this
that
brought
it
back
to
me
i
explained
what
i
could
of
the
manner
of
my
possession
i
see
very
interesting
something
i
never
seen
and
frankly
something
strictly
against
what
i
been
taught
nevertheless
it
not
impossible
we
are
witnesses
at
least
would
you
care
if
i
take
this
over
to
the
laboratory
it
was
a
new
complication
if
it
were
not
a
jewel
there
was
a
chance
of
its
being
damaged
i
was
as
anxious
as
he
but
i
had
been
warned
as
to
its
possession
i
sha
harm
it
i
see
to
that
i
have
suspicions
and
i
like
to
verify
them
a
chemist
does
blunder
across
such
a
thing
every
day
i
am
a
his
eyes
glistened
your
suspicions
i
asked
a
new
this
gem
a
new
element
perhaps
that
would
explain
the
blind
spot
it
was
not
exactly
of
earth
everything
had
confirmed
it
you
a
new
element
how
do
you
account
for
it
it
defies
your
laws
most
of
your
elements
are
evolved
through
tedious
process
this
is
picked
up
by
that
is
so
but
there
are
still
a
thousand
ways
a
meteor
perhaps
a
bit
of
cosmic
dust
there
are
many
shattered
comets
our
chemistry
is
earthly
there
are
undoubtedly
new
elements
that
we
do
know
of
perhaps
in
enormous
i
let
him
have
it
it
was
the
only
night
i
had
been
away
from
the
ring
i
may
say
that
it
is
the
only
time
i
have
been
free
from
its
isolation
when
i
called
at
his
office
next
day
i
found
he
had
merely
confirmed
his
suspicions
it
defied
analysis
there
was
no
reaction
under
all
tests
it
was
a
stranger
the
whole
science
that
had
been
built
up
to
explain
everything
had
here
explained
nothing
however
there
was
one
thing
that
he
had
uncovered
heat
perhaps
i
should
say
magnetism
it
was
cold
to
man
i
have
spoken
about
the
icy
blue
of
its
colour
it
was
cold
even
to
look
at
the
chemist
placed
it
in
my
hand
is
it
not
so
it
was
the
minute
it
touched
my
palm
i
could
sense
the
weird
horror
of
the
isolation
the
stone
was
cold
just
like
a
piece
of
ice
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
had
it
in
direct
contact
with
the
flesh
set
in
the
ring
its
impulse
had
always
been
secondary
you
notice
it
it
is
so
with
me
now
then
just
a
he
pressed
a
button
a
young
lady
answered
his
ring
she
glanced
first
at
myself
and
then
at
the
chemist
miss
mills
this
is
wendel
he
is
the
owner
of
the
gem
would
you
take
it
in
your
hand
and
please
tell
wendel
how
it
feels
she
laughed
she
was
a
bit
perplexed
i
do
understand
she
turned
to
me
we
had
the
same
dispute
yesterday
see
white
says
that
it
cold
but
it
is
not
it
is
warm
almost
burning
all
the
other
girls
think
just
as
i
and
all
the
men
as
i
do
averred
the
chemist
even
is
it
cold
to
you
she
asked
really
it
was
a
turn
i
had
looked
for
it
was
akin
to
life
this
relation
to
sex
could
it
account
for
the
strange
isolation
and
the
weariness
i
was
a
witness
to
its
potency
watson
i
could
feel
myself
dragging
under
i
had
just
one
question
tell
me
miss
mills
can
you
sense
anything
else
i
mean
beyond
its
temperature
she
smiled
a
bit
i
do
know
what
you
mean
exactly
it
is
a
beautiful
stone
i
would
like
to
have
you
think
its
possession
would
make
you
happy
her
eyes
sparkled
oh
she
exclaimed
i
know
it
would
i
can
feel
it
it
was
so
whatever
there
was
in
the
bit
of
sapphirine
blue
it
had
life
what
was
it
it
had
relation
to
sex
in
the
strict
line
of
fact
it
was
impossible
when
we
were
alone
again
i
turned
to
the
chemist
is
there
anything
more
you
uncovered
did
you
see
anything
in
the
stone
he
frowned
no
nothing
else
this
magnetism
is
the
only
thing
is
there
anything
more
now
i
had
said
anything
about
its
one
great
quality
he
stumbled
across
the
image
of
the
two
men
i
could
understand
it
i
did
tell
him
perhaps
i
was
wrong
down
inside
me
i
sensed
a
subtle
reason
for
secrecy
it
is
hard
to
explain
it
was
not
perverseness
it
was
a
finer
distinction
perhaps
it
was
the
influence
of
the
gem
i
took
it
back
to
the
jeweller
again
and
had
it
reset
xv
again
the
nervina
it
was
at
this
point
that
i
began
taking
notes
there
is
something
psychological
to
the
blind
spot
weird
and
touching
on
the
spirit
i
know
not
what
it
is
but
i
can
feel
it
it
impinges
on
to
life
i
can
sense
the
ecstasy
of
horror
i
am
not
afraid
whatever
it
is
that
is
dragging
me
down
it
is
not
evil
my
sensations
are
not
normal
for
the
benefit
of
my
successor
if
there
is
to
be
one
i
have
made
an
elaborate
detail
of
notes
and
comments
after
all
the
whole
thing
when
brought
down
to
the
end
must
fall
to
the
function
of
science
when
hobart
arrives
whatever
my
fate
he
will
find
a
complete
and
comprehensive
record
of
my
sensations
i
shall
keep
it
up
to
the
end
such
notes
being
dry
and
sometimes
confusing
i
have
purposely
omitted
them
from
this
narrative
but
there
are
some
things
that
must
be
given
to
the
world
i
shall
pick
out
the
salient
parts
and
give
them
chronologically
jerome
stayed
with
me
rather
i
should
say
he
spent
the
nights
with
me
most
of
the
time
he
was
on
the
elusive
trail
of
the
rhamda
from
the
minute
of
our
conversation
with
kennedy
he
held
to
one
conviction
he
was
positive
of
that
chemist
back
in
the
nineties
he
was
certain
of
the
rhamda
whatever
the
weirdness
of
his
theory
it
would
certainly
bear
investigation
when
he
was
not
on
the
trail
over
the
city
he
was
at
work
in
the
cellar
here
we
worked
together
we
dug
up
the
concrete
floor
and
did
a
bit
of
mining
i
was
interested
in
the
formation
from
the
words
of
budge
kennedy
the
bit
of
jewel
had
been
discovered
at
the
original
excavation
we
found
the
blue
clay
that
he
spoke
of
but
nothing
else
jerome
dissected
every
bit
of
earth
carefully
we
have
spent
many
hours
in
that
cellar
but
most
of
the
time
i
was
alone
when
not
too
worn
with
the
loneliness
and
weariness
i
worked
at
my
notes
it
has
been
a
hard
task
from
the
beginning
inertia
lack
of
energy
how
much
of
our
life
is
impulse
what
is
the
secret
that
backs
volition
it
has
been
will
from
the
beginning
i
must
thank
my
ancestors
without
the
strength
and
character
built
up
through
generations
i
would
have
succumbed
utterly
even
as
it
is
i
sometimes
think
i
am
wrong
in
following
the
dictates
of
watson
if
i
were
only
sure
i
have
pledged
my
word
and
my
honour
what
did
he
know
i
need
all
the
reserve
of
character
to
hold
up
against
the
nervina
from
the
beginning
she
has
been
my
opponent
what
is
her
interest
in
the
blind
spot
and
myself
who
is
she
i
can
not
think
of
her
as
evil
she
is
too
beautiful
too
tender
her
concern
is
so
real
sometimes
i
think
of
her
as
my
protector
that
it
is
she
and
she
alone
who
holds
back
the
power
which
would
engulf
me
once
she
made
a
personal
appeal
jerome
had
gone
i
was
alone
i
had
dragged
myself
to
the
desk
and
my
notes
and
data
it
was
along
toward
spring
and
in
the
first
shadows
of
the
early
evening
i
had
turned
on
the
lights
it
was
the
first
labour
i
had
done
for
several
days
i
had
a
great
deal
of
work
before
me
i
had
begun
sometime
before
to
take
down
my
temperature
i
was
careful
of
everything
now
as
much
as
i
could
be
under
the
depression
so
far
i
had
discerned
nothing
that
could
be
classed
as
pathological
there
is
something
subtle
about
the
nervina
she
is
much
like
the
rhamda
perhaps
they
are
the
same
i
hear
no
sound
i
have
no
notion
of
a
door
or
entrance
watson
had
said
of
the
rhamda
sometimes
you
see
him
sometimes
you
it
is
so
with
the
nervina
i
remember
only
my
working
at
the
data
and
the
sudden
movement
of
a
hand
upon
my
desk
a
girl
hand
it
was
bewildering
i
looked
up
i
had
not
seen
her
since
that
night
it
was
now
eight
months
did
i
not
know
i
would
have
recorded
them
as
years
her
expression
was
a
bit
more
sad
and
beautiful
the
same
wonderful
glow
of
her
eyes
and
tender
the
softness
that
comes
from
passion
and
love
and
virtue
the
same
wistful
droop
of
the
perfect
mouth
what
a
wondrous
mass
of
hair
she
had
i
dropped
my
pen
she
took
my
hand
i
could
sense
the
thrill
of
contact
cool
and
magnetic
harry
she
said
no
more
i
did
not
answer
i
was
too
taken
by
surprise
and
wonder
i
could
feel
her
concern
as
i
would
a
mother
what
was
her
interest
in
myself
the
contact
of
her
hand
sent
a
strange
pulse
through
my
vitals
she
was
so
beautiful
could
it
be
watson
said
he
loved
her
could
i
blame
him
harry
she
asked
how
long
is
it
to
continue
so
that
was
it
merely
an
envoy
to
accept
surrender
i
was
worn
utterly
weary
of
the
world
lonely
but
i
had
given
up
i
had
strength
still
and
will
enough
to
hold
out
to
the
end
perhaps
i
was
wrong
if
i
gave
her
the
ring
what
then
i
am
afraid
i
answered
that
i
must
go
on
i
have
given
my
word
it
has
been
much
harder
than
i
expected
this
jewel
what
has
it
to
do
with
the
blind
spot
it
controls
does
the
rhamda
desire
it
he
why
does
he
call
for
it
personally
why
does
he
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
it
would
be
much
easier
he
knows
and
you
know
that
i
am
after
holcomb
and
watson
i
might
even
forego
the
secret
would
he
release
the
doctor
no
harry
he
would
i
see
if
i
gave
up
the
ring
it
would
be
merely
for
my
personal
safety
i
am
a
coward
oh
she
said
do
say
that
you
must
give
the
ring
to
me
not
to
the
rhamda
he
must
not
control
the
blind
what
is
the
blind
spot
tell
harry
she
spoke
i
can
not
it
is
not
for
you
or
any
other
mortal
it
is
a
secret
that
should
never
have
been
uncovered
it
might
be
the
end
in
the
hands
of
the
rhamda
it
would
certainly
be
the
end
of
who
is
the
rhamda
who
are
you
you
are
too
beautiful
to
be
merely
woman
are
you
a
spirit
she
pressed
my
hand
ever
so
slightly
do
i
feel
like
a
spirit
i
am
material
as
much
as
you
are
we
live
see
but
you
are
not
of
this
world
her
eyes
grew
sadder
a
soft
longing
not
exactly
harry
not
exactly
it
is
a
long
story
and
a
very
strange
one
i
may
not
tell
you
it
is
for
your
own
good
i
am
your
friend
her
eyes
were
moist
i
do
you
see
oh
i
would
save
you
i
did
not
doubt
it
somehow
she
was
like
a
girl
of
dreams
pure
as
an
angel
her
wistfulness
only
deepened
her
beauty
it
came
like
a
shock
at
the
moment
i
could
love
this
woman
she
was
what
was
i
thinking
my
guilty
mind
ran
back
to
charlotte
i
had
loved
her
since
boyhood
i
would
be
a
coward
then
a
wild
fear
perhaps
of
jealousy
the
rhamda
is
he
your
husband
you
are
the
same
oh
she
answered
why
do
you
say
it
her
eyes
snapped
and
she
grew
rigid
the
rhamda
my
husband
if
you
only
knew
i
hate
him
we
are
enemies
it
was
he
who
opened
the
blind
spot
i
am
here
because
he
is
evil
to
watch
him
i
love
your
world
i
love
it
all
i
would
save
it
i
love
she
dropped
her
head
whatever
she
was
she
was
not
above
sobbing
i
touched
her
hair
it
was
of
the
softest
texture
i
have
ever
seen
the
lustre
was
like
all
the
beauty
of
night
woven
into
silk
she
loved
loved
i
could
love
i
was
on
the
point
of
surrender
tell
me
i
asked
just
one
thing
more
if
i
gave
you
this
ring
would
you
save
the
doctor
and
chick
watson
she
raised
her
head
her
eyes
glistened
but
she
did
not
answer
would
you
she
shook
her
head
i
can
not
she
answered
that
can
not
be
i
can
only
save
you
for
for
was
it
vanity
in
myself
i
do
know
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
hard
for
her
to
say
it
frankly
i
loved
her
i
knew
it
i
loved
charlotte
i
loved
them
both
but
i
held
to
my
purpose
are
the
professor
and
watson
living
they
are
they
conscious
she
nodded
harry
she
said
i
can
tell
you
that
they
are
living
and
conscious
you
have
seen
them
they
have
only
one
enemy
the
rhamda
but
they
must
never
come
out
of
the
blind
spot
i
am
their
friend
and
a
sudden
courage
came
upon
me
i
remembered
my
word
to
watson
i
had
loved
the
old
professor
i
would
save
them
if
necessary
i
would
follow
to
the
end
either
myself
or
fenton
one
of
us
would
solve
it
i
shall
keep
the
ring
i
said
i
shall
avenge
them
somehow
somewhere
i
feel
that
i
shall
do
it
even
if
i
must
follow
she
straightened
at
that
her
eyes
were
frightened
oh
she
said
why
do
you
say
it
it
must
not
be
you
would
perish
you
shall
not
do
it
i
must
save
you
you
must
not
go
alone
three
it
may
not
be
if
you
go
i
go
with
you
perhaps
oh
harry
she
dropped
her
head
again
her
body
shook
with
her
sobbing
plainly
she
was
a
girl
no
real
man
is
ever
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
tears
i
was
again
on
the
point
of
surrender
suddenly
she
looked
up
harry
she
spoke
sadly
i
have
just
one
thing
to
ask
you
must
see
charlotte
you
must
forget
me
we
can
never
you
love
charlotte
i
have
seen
her
she
a
beautiful
girl
you
have
written
she
is
worried
remember
what
you
mean
to
her
happiness
will
you
go
that
i
could
promise
yes
i
shall
see
she
rose
from
her
chair
i
held
her
hand
again
as
in
the
restaurant
i
lifted
it
to
my
lips
she
flushed
and
drew
it
away
she
bit
her
lip
her
beauty
was
a
kind
i
could
not
understand
you
must
see
charlotte
she
said
and
you
must
do
as
she
with
that
she
was
gone
there
was
a
car
waiting
the
last
i
saw
was
its
winking
dimming
into
the
darkness
xvi
charlotte
left
alone
i
began
thinking
of
charlotte
i
loved
her
of
that
i
was
certain
i
could
not
compare
her
with
the
nervina
she
was
like
myself
human
i
had
known
her
since
boyhood
the
other
was
out
of
the
ether
my
love
for
her
was
something
different
she
was
of
dreams
and
moonbeams
there
was
a
film
about
her
beauty
illusion
she
was
of
spirit
i
wrote
a
note
to
the
detective
and
left
it
upon
my
desk
after
that
i
packed
a
suitcase
and
hurried
to
the
station
if
i
was
going
i
would
do
it
at
once
i
could
not
trust
myself
too
far
this
visit
had
been
like
a
breath
of
air
for
the
moment
i
was
away
from
the
isolation
the
loneliness
and
the
weariness
how
i
dreaded
it
i
was
only
free
from
it
for
a
few
moments
on
the
train
it
came
back
upon
me
and
in
a
manner
that
was
startling
i
had
purchased
my
ticket
when
the
conductor
came
through
he
passed
me
he
gathered
tickets
all
about
me
but
he
did
not
notice
me
at
first
i
paid
no
attention
but
when
he
had
gone
through
the
car
several
times
i
held
up
my
ticket
he
did
not
stop
it
was
not
until
i
had
touched
him
that
he
gave
me
a
bit
of
attention
where
have
you
been
sitting
he
asked
i
pointed
to
the
seat
he
frowned
slightly
there
he
asked
did
you
say
you
were
sitting
in
that
seat
where
did
you
get
on
at
queer
he
answered
he
punched
the
ticket
queer
i
passed
that
seat
several
times
it
was
empty
empty
it
was
almost
a
shock
could
it
be
that
my
isolation
was
becoming
physical
as
well
as
mental
what
was
this
gulf
that
was
widening
between
myself
and
my
fellows
it
was
the
beginning
of
another
phase
i
have
noticed
it
many
times
on
the
street
in
public
places
everywhere
i
thread
in
and
out
among
men
sometimes
they
see
me
sometimes
they
do
it
is
strange
i
feel
at
times
as
though
i
might
be
vanishing
out
of
the
world
it
was
late
when
i
reached
my
old
home
but
the
lights
were
still
burning
my
favourite
dog
queen
was
on
the
veranda
as
i
came
up
the
steps
she
growled
slightly
but
on
recognition
went
into
a
series
of
circles
about
the
porch
my
father
opened
the
door
i
stepped
inside
he
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
his
jaw
dropped
harry
he
exclaimed
was
it
as
bad
as
that
how
much
meaning
may
be
placed
in
a
single
intonation
i
was
weary
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
the
ride
upon
the
train
had
been
too
much
my
mother
came
in
for
some
moments
i
was
busy
protesting
my
health
but
it
was
useless
it
was
until
i
had
partaken
of
a
few
of
the
old
nostrums
that
i
could
placate
her
work
work
work
my
boy
said
my
father
nothing
but
work
it
really
wo
do
you
a
shadow
you
must
take
a
vacation
go
to
the
mountains
forget
your
practice
for
a
short
i
did
tell
them
why
should
i
i
decided
right
then
it
was
my
own
battle
it
was
enough
for
me
without
casting
the
worry
upon
others
yet
i
could
not
see
charlotte
without
calling
on
my
parents
as
soon
as
possible
i
crossed
the
street
to
the
fentons
someone
had
seen
me
in
town
charlotte
was
waiting
she
was
the
same
beautiful
girl
i
had
known
so
long
the
blue
eyes
the
blonde
wavy
mass
of
hair
the
laughing
mouth
and
the
gladness
but
she
was
not
glad
now
it
was
almost
a
repetition
of
what
had
happened
at
home
only
here
a
bit
more
personal
she
clung
to
me
almost
in
terror
i
did
realise
i
had
gone
down
so
much
i
knew
my
weariness
but
i
had
thought
my
appearance
so
dejected
i
remembered
watson
he
had
been
wan
pale
forlorn
after
what
brief
explanation
i
could
give
i
proposed
a
stroll
in
the
moonlight
it
was
a
full
moon
a
wonderful
night
we
walked
down
the
avenue
under
the
elm
trees
charlotte
was
beautiful
and
worried
she
clung
to
my
arm
with
the
eagerness
of
possession
i
could
not
but
compare
her
with
nervina
there
was
a
contrast
charlotte
was
fresh
tender
affectionate
the
girl
of
my
boyhood
i
had
known
her
all
my
life
there
was
no
doubt
of
our
love
who
was
the
other
she
was
something
higher
out
of
mystery
out
of
life
almost
out
of
the
moonbeams
i
stopped
and
looked
up
the
great
full
orb
was
shining
i
did
know
that
i
spoke
harry
asked
charlotte
who
is
the
nervina
had
i
spoken
what
do
you
know
about
the
nervina
i
asked
she
has
been
to
see
me
she
told
me
she
said
you
would
be
here
tonight
i
was
waiting
she
is
very
beautiful
i
never
saw
anyone
like
her
she
is
wonderful
what
did
she
say
she
oh
harry
tell
me
i
have
waited
something
has
happened
tell
me
you
have
told
me
nothing
you
are
not
like
the
old
tell
me
about
the
nervina
what
did
she
say
charlotte
tell
me
everything
am
i
so
much
different
from
the
old
harry
she
clutched
at
my
arm
fearfully
she
looked
into
my
eyes
oh
she
said
how
can
you
say
it
you
have
laughed
once
you
are
melancholy
you
are
pale
drawn
haggard
you
keep
muttering
you
are
not
the
old
harry
is
it
this
nervina
at
first
i
thought
she
loved
you
but
she
does
not
she
wanted
to
know
all
about
you
and
about
our
love
she
was
so
interested
what
is
this
danger
i
did
answer
you
must
tell
me
this
ring
she
said
that
you
must
give
it
to
me
what
is
it
she
insisted
did
she
ask
that
she
told
you
to
take
the
ring
my
dear
i
asked
if
it
were
the
ring
and
it
were
so
sinister
would
i
be
a
man
to
give
it
to
my
loved
one
it
would
not
hurt
but
i
would
not
something
warned
me
it
was
a
ruse
to
get
it
out
of
my
possession
the
whole
thing
was
haunting
weird
ghostly
always
i
could
hear
watson
i
still
had
a
small
quota
of
courage
and
i
clung
steadfastly
to
my
purpose
it
was
a
sad
three
hours
poor
charlotte
i
shall
never
forget
it
it
is
the
hardest
task
on
earth
to
deny
one
loved
one
she
had
grown
into
my
heart
and
into
its
possession
she
clung
to
me
tenderly
tearfully
i
could
not
tell
her
her
feminine
instinct
sensed
disaster
in
spite
of
her
tears
i
insisted
when
i
kissed
her
goodnight
she
did
not
speak
but
she
looked
up
at
me
through
her
tears
it
was
the
hardest
thing
of
all
for
me
to
bear
xvii
the
shepherd
when
i
returned
to
the
city
next
morning
i
took
my
dog
it
was
a
strange
whim
but
one
which
was
to
lead
to
a
remarkable
development
i
have
always
been
a
lover
of
dogs
i
was
lonely
there
is
a
bond
between
a
dog
and
his
master
it
goes
beyond
definition
it
roots
down
into
nature
i
was
to
learn
much
she
was
an
australian
shepherd
she
was
of
a
tawny
black
and
from
birth
what
is
the
power
that
lies
behind
instinct
how
far
does
it
go
i
had
a
notion
that
the
dog
would
be
outside
the
sinister
clutch
that
was
dragging
me
under
happily
jerome
was
fond
of
dogs
he
was
reading
when
i
entered
with
queen
tugging
at
the
chain
he
looked
up
the
dog
recognised
the
heart
of
the
man
when
he
stooped
to
pet
her
she
moved
her
stub
tail
in
an
effusion
of
affectionate
acceptance
jerome
had
been
reading
le
theory
on
the
evolution
of
force
his
researches
after
the
mystery
had
led
him
into
the
depths
of
speculation
he
had
become
quite
a
scholar
after
our
first
greeting
i
unhooked
the
chain
and
let
queen
have
the
freedom
of
the
house
i
related
what
had
happened
the
detective
closed
the
book
and
sat
down
the
dog
waited
a
bit
for
further
petting
but
missing
that
she
began
sniffing
about
the
room
there
was
nothing
strange
about
it
of
course
i
myself
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
but
the
detective
was
watching
while
i
was
telling
my
story
he
was
following
every
movement
of
the
shepherd
suddenly
he
held
up
one
finger
i
turned
it
was
queen
a
low
growl
guttural
and
suspicious
she
was
standing
about
a
foot
from
the
portieres
that
separated
the
library
from
the
other
room
where
we
had
lost
watson
and
where
jerome
had
had
his
experience
with
the
old
lady
tense
and
rigid
one
forepaw
held
up
stealthily
her
stub
tail
erect
and
the
hair
along
her
back
bristled
again
the
low
growl
i
caught
jerome
eyes
it
was
queer
what
is
it
queen
i
spoke
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
she
wagged
her
tail
and
looked
round
then
stepped
between
the
curtains
just
her
head
she
drew
back
her
lips
drawn
from
her
teeth
snarling
she
was
rigid
alert
vitalised
somehow
it
made
me
cold
she
was
a
brave
dog
she
feared
nothing
the
detective
stepped
forward
and
pulled
the
curtains
apart
the
room
was
empty
we
looked
into
each
other
faces
what
is
there
to
instinct
what
is
its
range
we
could
see
nothing
but
not
to
the
dog
her
eyes
glowed
hate
fear
terror
her
whole
body
rigid
i
wonder
i
said
i
stepped
into
the
room
but
i
had
counted
on
the
dog
with
a
yelp
she
was
upon
me
had
me
by
the
calf
of
the
leg
and
was
drawing
me
back
she
stepped
in
front
of
me
a
low
guttural
growl
of
warning
but
there
was
nothing
in
that
room
of
that
we
were
certain
beats
me
said
the
detective
how
does
she
know
wonder
if
she
would
stop
me
he
stepped
forward
it
was
merely
a
repetition
she
caught
him
by
the
and
drew
him
back
she
crowded
us
away
from
the
curtain
it
was
almost
magnetic
we
could
see
nothing
neither
could
we
feel
was
it
possible
that
the
dog
could
see
beyond
us
the
detective
spoke
first
take
her
out
of
the
room
put
her
in
the
hall
tie
her
what
the
idea
merely
this
i
am
going
to
examine
the
room
no
i
am
not
afraid
be
mighty
glad
if
it
does
catch
me
anything
so
long
as
i
get
but
it
did
us
no
good
we
examined
the
room
many
times
that
night
both
of
us
in
the
end
there
was
nothing
only
the
weirdness
and
uncertainty
and
the
magnetic
undercurrent
which
we
could
feel
but
could
not
fathom
when
we
called
in
the
dog
she
stepped
to
the
portieres
and
commenced
her
vigil
she
crouched
slightly
behind
the
curtains
alert
ready
waiting
at
her
post
of
honour
from
that
moment
she
never
left
the
spot
except
under
compulsion
we
could
hear
her
at
all
times
of
the
night
the
low
growl
the
snarl
the
defiance
but
there
was
a
great
deal
more
that
we
were
to
learn
from
the
dog
it
was
jerome
who
first
called
my
attention
a
small
fact
at
the
beginning
but
of
a
strange
sequence
this
time
it
was
the
ring
queen
had
the
habit
that
is
common
to
most
dogs
she
would
lick
my
hand
to
show
her
affection
it
was
nothing
in
itself
but
for
one
fact
she
always
chose
the
left
hand
it
was
the
detective
who
first
noticed
it
always
and
every
opportunity
she
would
lick
the
jewel
we
made
a
little
test
to
try
her
i
would
remove
the
ring
from
one
hand
to
the
other
then
hold
it
behind
me
she
would
follow
it
was
a
strange
fact
but
of
course
not
inexplicable
a
scent
or
the
attraction
of
taste
might
account
for
it
however
these
little
tests
led
to
a
rather
remarkable
discovery
one
night
we
had
called
the
dog
from
her
vigil
as
usual
she
came
to
the
jewel
by
chance
i
pressed
the
gem
against
her
head
it
was
a
mere
trifle
yet
it
was
of
consequence
a
few
minutes
before
i
had
dropped
a
handkerchief
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
i
was
just
thinking
about
picking
it
up
it
was
only
a
small
thing
yet
it
put
us
on
the
track
of
the
gem
strangest
potency
the
dog
walked
to
the
handkerchief
she
brought
it
back
in
her
mouth
at
first
i
took
it
for
a
pure
coincidence
i
repeated
the
experiment
with
a
book
the
same
result
i
looked
up
at
jerome
what
the
matter
then
when
i
explained
the
dickens
try
it
over
and
over
again
we
repeated
it
using
different
articles
pieces
of
which
i
was
certain
she
did
know
the
name
there
was
a
strange
bond
between
the
gem
and
the
intelligence
some
strange
force
emanating
from
its
lustre
on
myself
it
was
depressing
on
the
dog
it
was
life
itself
at
last
jerome
had
an
inspiration
try
the
rhamda
he
said
think
of
him
perhaps
it
was
most
surprising
certainly
it
was
remarkable
it
was
too
much
like
intelligence
a
bit
too
uncanny
at
the
instant
of
the
thought
the
dog
leaped
backward
such
a
strange
transformation
she
was
naturally
gentle
in
one
instant
she
had
gone
mad
mad
not
in
the
literal
interpretation
but
figuratively
she
sprang
back
snapping
her
teeth
bared
her
hair
bristled
her
nostrils
drawn
with
one
bound
she
leaped
between
the
curtains
jerome
jumped
up
with
an
exclamation
he
drew
the
portieres
i
was
behind
him
the
dog
was
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
room
bristling
the
room
was
empty
what
did
she
see
what
one
thing
was
certain
though
we
were
sure
of
nothing
else
we
were
certain
of
the
rhamda
we
could
trust
the
canine
instinct
every
previous
experiment
we
had
essayed
had
been
crowned
with
success
we
had
here
a
fact
but
no
explanation
if
we
could
only
put
things
together
and
extract
the
law
it
was
late
when
we
retired
i
could
not
sleep
the
restlessness
of
the
dog
held
back
my
slumber
she
would
growl
sullenly
then
stir
about
for
a
new
position
she
was
never
quite
still
i
could
picture
her
there
in
the
library
behind
the
curtains
crouched
half
resting
half
slumbering
always
watching
i
would
awaken
in
the
night
and
listen
a
low
guttural
warning
a
sullen
whine
then
stillness
it
was
the
same
with
my
companion
we
could
never
quite
understand
it
perhaps
we
were
a
bit
afraid
but
one
can
become
accustomed
to
almost
anything
it
went
on
for
many
nights
without
anything
happening
until
one
night
it
was
dark
exceedingly
dark
with
neither
moon
nor
starlight
one
of
those
nights
of
inky
intenseness
i
can
not
say
just
exactly
what
woke
me
the
house
was
strangely
silent
and
still
the
air
seemed
stretched
and
laden
it
was
summer
perhaps
it
was
the
heat
i
only
knew
that
i
woke
suddenly
and
blinked
in
the
darkness
in
the
next
room
with
the
door
open
i
could
hear
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
detective
a
heavy
feeling
lay
against
my
heart
i
had
grown
accustomed
to
dread
and
isolation
but
this
was
different
perhaps
it
was
premonition
i
do
not
know
and
yet
i
was
terribly
sleepy
i
remember
that
i
struck
a
match
and
looked
at
my
watch
on
the
bureau
twelve
no
sound
not
even
queen
not
even
a
rumble
from
the
streets
i
lay
back
and
dropped
into
slumber
just
as
i
drifted
off
to
sleep
i
had
a
blurring
fancy
of
sound
guttural
whining
fearful
then
suddenly
drifting
into
incoherent
rumbling
phantasms
a
dream
i
awoke
suddenly
someone
was
speaking
it
was
jerome
harry
i
was
frightened
it
was
like
something
clutching
out
of
the
darkness
i
sat
up
i
did
answer
it
was
necessary
the
incoherence
of
my
dream
had
been
external
the
library
was
just
below
me
i
could
hear
the
dog
pacing
to
and
fro
and
her
snarling
snarling
it
was
just
that
it
was
something
to
arouse
terror
she
had
never
growled
like
that
i
was
positive
i
could
hear
her
suddenly
leap
back
from
the
curtains
she
barked
never
before
had
she
come
to
that
then
a
sudden
lunge
into
the
other
room
a
vicious
series
of
snapping
barks
yelps
pandemonium
i
could
picture
her
leaping
at
what
then
suddenly
i
leaped
out
of
bed
the
barks
grew
faint
faint
fainter
into
the
distance
in
the
darkness
i
could
find
the
switch
i
bumped
into
jerome
we
were
lost
in
our
confusion
it
was
a
moment
before
we
could
find
either
a
match
or
a
switch
to
turn
on
the
lights
but
at
last
i
shall
not
forget
that
moment
nor
jerome
he
was
rigid
one
arm
held
aloft
his
eyes
bulged
out
the
whole
house
was
full
of
sound
vibrant
magnetic
it
was
the
bell
i
jumped
for
the
stairway
but
not
so
quick
as
jerome
with
three
bounds
we
were
in
the
library
with
the
lights
on
the
sound
was
running
down
to
silence
we
tore
down
the
curtains
and
rushed
into
the
room
it
was
empty
there
was
not
even
the
dog
queen
had
gone
in
a
vain
rush
of
grief
i
began
calling
and
whistling
it
was
an
overwhelming
moment
the
poor
brave
shepherd
she
had
seen
it
and
rushed
into
its
face
it
was
the
last
night
i
was
to
have
jerome
we
sat
up
until
daylight
for
the
thousandth
time
we
went
over
the
house
in
detail
but
there
was
nothing
only
the
ring
at
the
suggestion
of
the
detective
i
touched
the
match
to
the
sapphire
it
was
the
same
the
colour
diminishing
and
the
translucent
corridors
deepening
into
the
distance
then
the
blur
and
the
coming
of
shadows
the
men
watson
and
the
professor
and
my
dog
of
the
men
only
the
heads
showed
but
the
dog
was
full
figure
she
was
sitting
apparently
on
a
pedestal
her
tongue
was
lolling
out
of
her
mouth
and
her
face
of
that
gentle
intelligence
which
only
the
australian
shepherd
is
heir
to
that
is
all
no
more
nothing
if
we
had
hoped
to
discover
anything
through
her
medium
we
were
disappointed
instead
of
clearing
up
the
whole
thing
had
grown
deeper
i
have
said
that
it
was
the
last
night
i
was
to
have
jerome
i
know
it
then
jerome
went
out
early
in
the
morning
i
went
to
bed
i
was
not
afraid
in
the
daylight
i
was
certain
now
that
the
danger
was
localised
as
long
as
i
kept
out
of
that
apartment
i
had
nothing
to
fear
nevertheless
the
thing
was
magnetic
a
subtle
weirdness
pervaded
the
building
i
did
not
sleep
soundly
i
was
lonely
the
isolation
was
crowding
on
me
in
the
afternoon
i
stepped
out
on
the
streets
i
have
spoken
of
my
experience
with
the
conductor
on
this
day
i
had
the
certainty
of
my
isolation
it
was
startling
in
the
face
of
what
i
was
and
what
i
had
seen
it
was
almost
terrifying
it
was
the
first
time
i
thought
of
sending
for
hobart
i
had
thought
i
could
hold
out
the
complete
suddenness
of
the
thing
set
me
to
thinking
i
thought
of
watson
it
was
the
last
phase
the
feebleness
the
wanness
the
inertia
he
had
been
a
far
stronger
man
than
i
in
the
beginning
i
must
cable
fenton
while
i
had
still
an
ego
in
the
presence
of
men
i
must
reach
out
for
help
it
was
a
strange
thing
and
inexplicable
i
was
not
invisible
do
think
that
i
simply
did
not
individualise
men
did
notice
me
till
i
spoke
as
if
i
was
imperceptibly
losing
the
essence
of
self
i
still
had
some
hold
on
the
world
while
it
remained
i
must
get
word
to
hobart
i
did
not
delay
straight
to
the
office
i
went
and
paid
for
the
cable
can
not
hold
out
much
longer
come
at
harry
i
was
a
bit
ashamed
i
had
hoped
i
had
counted
upon
myself
i
had
trusted
in
the
full
strength
of
my
individuality
i
had
been
healthy
strong
full
blooded
on
the
fullness
of
vitality
one
would
live
forever
there
is
no
tomorrow
it
was
not
a
year
ago
i
was
eighty
it
had
been
so
with
watson
what
was
this
subtle
thing
that
ate
into
one
marrow
i
had
read
of
banshees
lemures
and
leprechauns
they
were
the
ghosts
and
the
fairies
of
ignorance
but
they
were
not
like
this
it
was
impersonal
hidden
inexorable
it
was
mystery
and
i
believed
that
it
was
nature
i
know
it
now
even
as
i
write
i
can
sense
the
potency
of
the
force
about
me
some
law
some
principle
some
force
that
science
has
not
uncovered
what
is
that
law
that
shall
bridge
the
chaos
between
the
mystic
and
the
substantial
i
am
standing
on
the
bridge
and
i
can
not
see
it
what
is
the
great
law
that
was
discovered
by
holcomb
who
is
the
rhamda
who
is
the
nervina
jerome
has
not
returned
i
can
not
understand
it
it
has
been
a
week
i
am
living
on
brandy
not
much
of
anything
else
i
am
waiting
for
fenton
i
have
taken
all
my
elaborations
and
notes
and
put
them
together
perhaps
i
this
is
the
last
of
the
strange
document
left
by
harry
wendel
the
following
memorandum
is
written
by
charlotte
fenton
xviii
charlotte
story
i
do
not
know
it
is
hard
to
write
after
what
has
happened
hobart
says
that
it
is
why
i
am
to
write
it
it
is
to
be
a
plain
narrative
besides
he
is
very
busy
and
can
not
do
it
himself
there
must
be
some
record
i
shall
do
my
best
and
hold
out
of
my
writing
as
much
as
i
can
of
my
emotion
i
shall
start
with
the
nervina
it
was
the
first
i
knew
the
first
warning
looking
back
i
can
not
but
wonder
no
person
i
think
who
has
ever
seen
the
nervina
can
do
much
else
she
is
so
beautiful
beautiful
why
do
i
say
it
i
should
be
jealous
and
i
should
hate
her
yet
i
do
not
why
is
it
it
was
about
eight
months
after
hobart
had
left
for
south
america
i
remember
those
eight
months
as
the
longest
in
my
life
because
of
harry
i
am
a
girl
and
i
like
attention
all
girls
do
ordinarily
he
would
come
over
every
fortnight
at
least
after
hobart
had
gone
he
came
once
only
and
of
course
i
resented
the
inattention
it
seemed
to
me
that
no
business
could
be
of
enough
importance
if
he
really
loved
me
even
his
letters
were
few
and
far
between
what
he
wrote
were
slow
and
weary
and
of
an
undertone
that
i
could
not
fathom
i
loved
harry
i
could
not
understand
it
i
had
a
thousand
fearful
thoughts
and
jealousies
but
they
were
feminine
and
in
no
way
approximated
even
the
beginning
of
the
truth
inattention
was
not
like
harry
it
was
not
until
the
coming
of
the
nervina
that
i
was
afraid
afraid
i
will
not
say
that
exactly
it
was
rather
a
suspicion
a
queer
undercurrent
of
wonder
and
doubt
the
beauty
of
the
girl
her
interest
in
harry
and
myself
her
concern
over
this
ring
put
me
a
bit
on
guard
i
wondered
what
this
ring
had
to
do
with
harry
wendel
she
did
not
tell
me
in
exact
words
or
in
literal
explanation
but
she
managed
to
convey
all
too
well
a
lurking
impression
of
its
sinister
potency
it
was
something
baleful
something
the
very
essence
of
which
would
break
down
the
life
of
one
who
wore
it
harry
had
come
into
its
possession
by
accident
and
she
would
save
him
she
had
failed
through
direct
appeal
now
she
had
come
to
me
she
did
not
say
a
word
of
the
blind
spot
and
the
next
day
came
harry
it
was
really
a
shock
though
i
had
been
warned
by
the
girl
he
was
not
harry
at
all
but
another
his
eyes
were
dim
and
they
had
lost
their
lustre
when
they
did
show
light
at
all
it
was
a
kind
that
was
a
bit
fearful
he
was
wan
worn
and
shrunk
to
a
shadow
as
if
he
had
gone
through
a
long
illness
he
said
he
had
not
been
sick
he
maintained
that
he
was
quite
well
physically
and
on
his
finger
was
the
ring
of
which
the
girl
had
spoken
its
value
must
have
been
incalculable
wherever
he
moved
his
hand
its
blue
flame
cut
a
path
through
the
darkness
but
he
said
nothing
about
it
i
waited
and
wondered
and
was
afraid
it
was
not
until
our
walk
under
the
elm
trees
that
it
was
mentioned
it
was
a
full
moon
a
wonderful
mellow
moon
of
summer
he
stopped
suddenly
and
gazed
up
at
the
orb
above
us
it
seemed
to
me
that
his
mind
was
wandering
he
held
me
closely
tenderly
he
was
not
at
all
like
harry
there
was
a
missing
of
self
of
individuality
he
spoke
in
abstractions
the
maiden
of
the
moonbeams
he
said
what
can
it
mean
and
then
i
asked
him
he
has
already
told
of
our
conversation
it
was
the
ring
of
which
the
nervina
had
told
me
it
had
to
do
with
the
blind
spot
the
great
secret
that
had
taken
holcomb
he
would
not
give
it
to
me
i
worked
hard
for
even
then
i
was
not
afraid
of
it
something
told
me
i
must
do
it
to
save
him
it
was
weird
and
something
i
could
not
understand
but
i
must
do
it
for
harry
i
failed
though
he
was
broken
in
every
visible
way
there
was
one
thing
as
strong
as
ever
his
honour
he
was
not
afraid
he
had
been
the
same
in
his
boyhood
when
we
parted
that
night
he
kissed
me
i
shall
never
forget
how
long
he
looked
into
my
eyes
nor
his
sadness
that
is
all
the
next
morning
he
left
for
san
francisco
and
then
came
the
end
a
message
abrupt
and
sudden
it
was
some
time
after
and
put
a
period
to
my
increasing
stress
and
worry
it
read
city
of
peru
docks
tonight
at
eight
meet
me
at
the
pier
hobart
coming
harry
it
was
a
short
message
and
a
bit
twisted
in
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
have
motored
down
and
brought
me
back
to
greet
hobart
it
was
a
bit
strange
that
i
should
meet
him
at
the
pier
however
i
had
barely
time
to
get
to
the
city
if
i
hurried
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
it
was
dark
when
i
reached
san
francisco
i
was
a
full
twenty
minutes
early
at
the
pier
a
few
people
were
waiting
i
looked
about
for
harry
he
was
to
meet
me
and
i
was
certain
that
i
would
find
him
but
he
was
not
there
of
course
there
was
still
time
he
was
sure
to
be
on
hand
to
greet
hobart
nevertheless
i
had
a
vague
mistrust
since
that
strange
visit
i
had
not
been
sure
harry
was
well
there
was
something
to
this
mystery
that
he
had
not
told
me
why
had
he
asked
me
to
meet
him
at
the
pier
why
did
he
come
when
the
boat
docked
and
he
was
still
missing
i
was
doubly
worried
hobart
came
down
the
gangplank
he
was
great
strong
healthy
and
it
seemed
to
me
in
a
terrible
hurry
he
scanned
the
faces
hurriedly
and
ran
over
to
me
where
harry
he
kissed
me
and
in
the
same
breath
repeated
harry
oh
hobart
i
exclaimed
what
the
matter
with
harry
tell
me
something
terrible
he
was
afraid
plainly
i
could
see
that
there
were
lines
of
anxiety
about
his
eyes
he
clutched
me
by
the
arm
and
drew
me
away
he
was
to
meet
me
here
i
said
he
did
come
he
was
to
meet
me
here
oh
hobart
i
saw
him
some
time
ago
he
was
it
was
not
harry
at
all
do
you
know
anything
about
it
for
a
minute
he
stood
still
looking
at
me
i
had
never
seen
hobart
frightened
but
at
that
moment
there
was
that
in
his
eyes
which
i
could
not
understand
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
started
out
almost
at
a
run
there
were
many
people
and
we
dodged
in
and
out
among
them
hobart
carried
a
suitcase
he
hailed
a
taxi
i
do
know
how
i
got
into
the
car
it
was
a
blur
i
was
frightened
some
terrible
thing
had
occurred
and
hobart
knew
it
i
remember
a
few
words
spoken
to
the
driver
speed
speed
no
limit
never
mind
the
law
and
chatterton
place
after
that
the
convulsive
jerking
over
the
cobbled
streets
a
climbing
over
hills
and
twisted
corners
and
hobart
at
my
side
faster
faster
he
was
saying
faster
my
lord
was
there
ever
a
car
so
slow
harry
harry
i
could
hear
him
breathing
a
prayer
another
hill
the
car
turned
and
came
suddenly
to
a
stop
hobart
leaped
out
a
sombre
house
a
light
burning
in
one
of
the
windows
a
dim
light
almost
subdued
and
uncanny
i
had
never
seen
anything
so
lonely
as
that
light
it
was
grey
uncertain
scarcely
a
flicker
perhaps
it
was
my
nerves
i
had
scarcely
strength
to
climb
the
steps
hobart
grasped
the
knob
and
thrust
open
the
door
i
can
never
forget
it
it
is
hard
to
write
the
whole
thing
the
room
the
walls
lined
with
books
the
dim
pale
light
the
faded
green
carpet
and
the
man
pale
worn
almost
a
shadow
of
his
former
self
was
it
harry
wendel
he
had
aged
forty
years
he
was
stooped
withered
exhausted
a
bottle
of
brandy
on
the
desk
before
him
in
his
weak
thin
hand
an
empty
wineglass
the
gem
upon
his
finger
glowed
with
a
flame
that
was
almost
wicked
it
was
blue
burning
giving
out
sparkles
of
light
like
a
colour
out
of
hell
the
path
of
its
light
was
unholy
it
was
too
much
alive
we
both
sprang
forward
hobart
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
harry
old
boy
harry
do
you
know
us
it
hobart
and
it
was
terrible
he
did
seem
to
know
he
looked
right
at
us
but
he
spoke
in
abstractions
two
he
said
and
he
listened
two
do
you
hear
it
he
caught
hobart
by
the
arm
now
listen
two
no
it
three
did
i
say
three
ca
you
hear
it
the
old
lady
she
speaks
out
of
the
shadows
there
there
now
listen
she
has
been
counting
to
me
always
she
says
three
soon
it
will
be
what
did
he
mean
what
was
it
about
who
was
the
old
lady
i
looked
round
i
saw
no
one
hobart
stooped
over
harry
began
slowly
to
recognise
us
it
was
as
if
his
mind
had
wandered
and
was
coming
back
from
a
far
place
he
spoke
slowly
his
words
were
incoherent
and
rambling
hobart
he
said
you
know
her
she
is
the
maiden
out
of
the
moonbeams
the
rhamda
he
is
our
enemy
hobart
charlotte
i
know
so
much
i
can
not
tell
you
you
are
two
hours
late
it
a
strange
thing
i
have
found
it
and
i
think
i
know
it
came
suddenly
the
discovery
of
the
great
professor
why
did
you
come
two
hours
earlier
we
might
have
he
dropped
his
head
upon
his
arms
then
as
suddenly
he
looked
up
he
drew
the
ring
from
his
finger
give
it
to
charlotte
he
said
it
wo
hurt
her
do
touch
it
yourself
had
i
only
known
watson
did
know
he
straightened
he
was
tense
rigid
listening
do
you
hear
anything
listen
can
you
hear
it
the
old
lady
there
but
there
was
not
a
sound
only
the
rumble
of
the
streets
the
ticking
of
the
clock
and
our
again
he
went
through
the
counting
hobart
yes
and
charlotte
the
ring
ah
yet
it
was
there
keep
it
give
it
to
no
one
two
hours
ago
we
might
have
conquered
but
i
had
to
keep
the
ring
it
was
too
much
too
powerful
a
man
may
not
wear
it
charlotte
he
took
my
hand
and
ran
the
ring
upon
my
finger
poor
charlotte
here
is
the
ring
the
most
wonderful
again
he
dropped
over
he
was
weak
there
was
something
going
from
him
minute
by
minute
water
he
asked
hobart
some
it
was
too
pitiful
harry
our
harry
come
to
a
strait
like
this
hobart
rushed
to
another
room
with
the
tumbler
i
could
hear
him
fumbling
i
stooped
over
harry
but
he
held
up
his
hand
no
charlotte
no
you
must
not
if
he
stopped
again
the
strange
attention
as
if
he
was
listening
to
something
far
off
in
the
distance
the
pupils
of
his
hollow
worn
lustreless
eyes
were
he
stood
on
his
feet
rigid
quivering
then
he
held
up
his
hand
listen
but
there
was
nothing
it
was
just
as
before
merely
the
murmuring
of
the
city
night
and
the
clock
ticking
it
the
dog
hear
her
and
the
old
lady
now
listen
now
there
are
two
three
three
now
there
are
three
there
he
turned
to
me
can
you
hear
it
charlotte
no
how
strange
perhaps
he
pointed
to
the
corner
of
the
room
that
paper
will
you
i
shall
always
go
over
that
moment
i
have
thought
over
it
many
times
and
have
wondered
at
the
sequence
had
i
not
stepped
across
the
library
what
would
have
happened
what
was
it
i
had
stooped
to
pick
up
the
piece
of
paper
there
came
a
queer
cracking
snapping
sound
almost
audible
i
have
a
strange
recollection
of
harry
standing
up
by
the
side
of
the
desk
a
flitting
vision
an
intuition
of
some
terrible
force
it
was
out
of
nothing
nowhere
approaching
i
turned
about
and
i
saw
it
the
dot
of
blue
blue
that
is
what
it
was
at
first
blue
and
burning
like
the
flame
of
a
million
jewels
centred
into
a
needlepoint
on
the
ceiling
directly
above
harry
head
it
was
scintillating
coruscating
opalescent
but
it
was
blue
most
of
all
it
was
the
colour
of
life
and
of
death
it
was
burning
throbbing
concentrated
i
tried
to
scream
but
i
was
frozen
with
horror
the
dot
changed
colour
and
went
to
a
it
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
to
open
then
it
turned
to
white
and
dropped
like
a
string
of
incandescence
touching
harry
on
the
head
what
was
it
it
was
all
so
sudden
a
door
flung
open
and
a
swish
of
rushing
silk
a
woman
a
beautiful
girl
the
nervina
it
was
she
never
have
i
seen
anyone
like
her
she
was
so
beautiful
in
her
face
all
the
compassion
a
woman
is
heir
to
for
scarcely
a
second
she
stopped
charlotte
she
called
charlotte
oh
why
did
you
save
him
he
loves
you
then
she
turned
to
harry
it
shall
not
be
he
shall
not
go
alone
i
shall
save
him
even
beyond
with
that
she
rushed
upon
harry
it
was
all
done
in
an
instant
her
arms
were
outstretched
to
the
dimming
form
of
harry
and
the
incandescence
the
splendid
impassioned
girl
their
forms
intermingled
a
blur
of
her
beautiful
body
and
harry
wan
weary
face
a
flash
of
light
a
thread
of
incandescence
a
quiver
and
they
were
gone
the
next
i
knew
was
the
strong
arms
of
my
brother
hobart
he
gave
me
the
water
he
had
fetched
for
harry
he
was
terribly
upset
but
very
calm
he
held
the
glass
up
to
my
lips
he
was
speaking
do
worry
do
worry
i
know
now
i
think
i
know
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
them
go
i
heard
the
bell
harry
is
safe
it
is
the
nervina
i
shall
get
harry
we
solve
the
blind
xix
hobart
fenton
takes
up
the
tale
right
here
at
the
outset
i
had
better
make
a
clean
breast
of
something
which
the
reader
will
very
soon
suspect
anyhow
i
am
a
plain
unpoetic
man
trained
as
a
civil
engineer
and
in
most
respects
totally
dissimilar
from
the
man
who
wrote
the
first
account
of
the
blind
spot
harry
had
already
touched
upon
this
he
came
of
an
artistic
family
i
think
he
must
have
taken
up
law
in
the
hope
that
the
old
saying
would
prove
true
the
only
certain
thing
about
law
is
its
for
he
dearly
loved
the
mysterious
the
unknowable
he
liked
uncertainty
for
its
excitement
and
it
is
a
mighty
good
thing
that
he
was
honest
for
he
would
have
made
a
highly
dangerous
crook
observe
that
i
use
the
past
tense
in
referring
to
my
old
friend
i
do
this
in
the
interests
of
strict
scientific
accuracy
to
satisfy
those
who
would
contend
that
having
utterly
vanished
from
sight
and
sound
of
man
harry
wendel
is
no
more
but
in
my
own
heart
is
the
firm
conviction
that
he
is
still
very
much
alive
within
an
hour
of
his
astounding
disappearance
my
sister
charlotte
and
i
made
our
way
to
an
hotel
and
despite
the
terrible
nature
of
what
had
happened
we
managed
to
get
a
few
hours
rest
the
following
morning
charlotte
declared
herself
quite
strong
enough
to
discuss
the
situation
we
lost
no
time
it
will
be
remembered
that
i
had
spent
nearly
the
whole
of
the
preceding
year
in
south
america
putting
through
an
irrigation
scheme
thus
i
knew
little
of
what
had
occurred
in
that
interval
on
the
other
hand
harry
and
i
had
never
seen
fit
to
take
charlotte
into
our
confidence
as
i
now
see
we
should
have
done
so
we
fairly
pounced
upon
the
manuscript
which
harry
had
left
behind
and
by
the
time
we
had
finished
reading
it
i
for
one
had
reached
one
solid
conclusion
i
convinced
i
said
that
the
stranger
rhamda
avec
is
an
villain
despite
his
agreeable
ways
i
think
he
was
solely
and
deliberately
to
blame
for
professor
holcomb
disappearance
consequently
this
rhamda
is
in
himself
a
very
valuable
clue
as
to
harry
present
referring
to
harry
notes
i
pointed
out
the
fact
that
although
avec
had
often
been
seen
on
the
streets
of
san
francisco
yet
the
police
had
never
been
able
to
lay
hands
on
him
this
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
man
might
possess
the
power
of
actually
making
himself
visible
or
invisible
at
will
only
i
was
careful
to
add
understand
i
do
rank
him
as
a
magician
or
sorcerer
nothing
like
that
i
rather
think
that
merely
in
possession
of
a
scientific
secret
no
more
wonderful
in
itself
than
say
wireless
he
merely
got
hold
of
it
in
advance
of
the
others
that
then
you
think
that
the
woman
too
is
human
the
nervina
i
hesitated
perhaps
you
know
more
of
this
part
of
the
thing
than
i
i
only
know
slowly
that
she
came
and
told
me
that
harry
was
soon
to
call
and
somehow
i
never
felt
jealous
of
her
then
she
added
at
the
same
time
i
can
understand
that
harry
might
might
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
she
she
was
very
charlotte
is
a
brave
girl
she
kept
her
voice
as
steady
as
my
own
we
next
discussed
the
disappearance
of
chick
watson
these
details
are
already
familiar
to
the
reader
of
harry
story
likewise
what
happened
to
queen
his
australian
shepherd
like
the
other
vanishings
it
was
followed
by
a
single
stroke
on
that
prodigious
invisible
bell
what
harry
calls
the
bell
of
the
blind
and
he
has
already
mentioned
my
opinion
that
this
phenomenon
signifies
the
closing
of
the
portal
of
the
unknown
the
end
of
the
special
conditions
which
produce
the
bluish
spot
on
the
ceiling
the
incandescent
streak
of
light
and
the
vanishing
of
whoever
falls
into
the
affected
region
the
mere
fact
that
no
trace
of
the
bell
ever
was
found
has
not
shaken
my
opinion
and
thus
we
reached
the
final
disappearance
that
which
took
away
harry
charlotte
contrived
to
keep
her
voice
as
resolute
as
before
as
she
said
he
and
the
nervina
vanished
together
i
turned
round
just
as
she
rushed
in
crying
out
ca
let
you
go
alone
i
save
you
even
beyond
that
all
she
said
before
it
you
saw
nothing
of
the
rhamda
then
and
we
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
of
him
since
until
we
got
in
touch
with
him
one
important
clue
as
to
harry
fate
was
out
of
our
reach
there
remained
to
us
just
one
thread
of
hope
the
ring
which
charlotte
was
now
wearing
on
her
finger
i
lit
a
match
and
held
it
to
the
face
of
the
gem
as
happened
many
times
before
the
stone
exhibited
its
most
astounding
quality
as
soon
as
faintly
heated
the
surface
at
first
clouded
then
cleared
in
a
curious
fashion
revealing
a
startling
distinct
miniature
likeness
of
the
four
who
had
vanished
into
the
blind
spot
i
make
no
attempt
to
explain
this
somehow
or
other
that
stone
possesses
a
telescopic
quality
which
brings
to
a
focus
right
in
front
of
the
beholder
eyes
a
tiny
of
our
vanished
friends
also
the
gem
magnifies
what
it
reveals
so
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
holcomb
chick
watson
queen
and
harry
wendel
are
actually
reproduced
i
shall
not
say
contained
in
that
gem
neither
shall
i
say
that
they
are
reflected
they
are
simply
reproduced
there
also
it
should
be
understood
that
their
images
are
living
only
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
men
are
to
be
seen
but
there
is
animation
of
the
features
such
as
can
not
be
mistaken
granted
that
these
four
vanished
in
the
blind
spot
whatever
that
is
and
granted
that
this
ring
is
some
inexplicable
window
or
vestibule
between
that
locality
and
this
commonplace
world
of
ours
then
manifestly
it
would
seem
that
all
four
are
still
alive
i
am
sure
of
it
declared
charlotte
managing
to
smile
wistfully
at
the
living
reproduction
of
her
sweetheart
and
i
think
harry
did
perfectly
right
in
handing
it
to
me
to
why
well
if
for
no
other
reason
than
because
it
behaves
so
differently
with
me
than
it
did
with
him
hobart
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
this
fact
is
very
significant
if
chick
had
only
known
of
it
he
would
have
insisted
that
harry
should
wear
it
and
then
ca
be
helped
i
interrupted
quickly
chick
did
know
he
was
only
certain
that
someone
someone
must
wear
the
ring
that
it
pass
out
of
the
possession
of
humans
moreover
much
as
rhamda
avec
may
desire
it
and
the
nervina
too
neither
can
secure
it
through
the
use
of
force
nobody
knows
charlotte
shivered
i
afraid
there
something
spooky
about
it
after
nothing
of
the
sort
with
a
conviction
that
has
never
left
me
this
ring
is
a
perfectly
sound
fact
as
indisputable
as
the
submarine
there
nothing
supernatural
about
it
for
that
matter
i
personally
doubt
if
there
anything
supernatural
every
phenomenon
which
seems
at
first
so
wonderful
becomes
commonplace
enough
as
soon
as
explained
is
it
true
that
you
yourself
are
already
getting
used
to
that
ring
ye
es
reluctantly
that
is
partly
if
only
it
were
someone
other
than
harry
of
course
i
hurried
to
say
i
only
wanted
to
make
it
clear
that
we
have
any
witchcraft
to
deal
with
this
whole
mystery
will
become
plain
as
day
and
that
damned
soon
you
got
a
theory
hopefully
several
that
the
trouble
i
had
to
admit
i
do
know
which
is
best
to
follow
it
may
be
a
spiritualistic
thing
after
all
or
it
may
fall
under
the
head
of
psychology
nothing
but
hallucinations
in
other
oh
that
wo
do
evidently
distressed
i
know
what
i
saw
doubt
my
reason
if
i
thought
i
only
fancied
it
so
would
i
well
laying
aside
the
spiritualistic
theory
there
remains
the
possibility
of
some
hitherto
undiscovered
scientific
secret
and
if
the
rhamda
is
in
possession
of
it
then
the
matter
simmers
down
to
a
plain
case
of
but
how
does
he
do
it
that
the
whole
question
however
i
sure
of
this
i
was
fingering
the
ring
as
i
spoke
the
reproduction
of
our
friends
had
faded
now
leaving
that
dully
glowing
pale
blue
light
once
more
this
ring
is
absolutely
real
it
no
hallucination
it
performs
as
well
in
broad
daylight
as
in
the
night
no
special
conditions
needed
it
neither
a
fraud
nor
an
illusion
in
short
this
ring
is
merely
a
phenomenon
which
science
has
not
yet
explained
that
it
can
and
will
be
explained
is
strictly
up
to
us
once
we
understand
its
peculiar
properties
we
can
mighty
soon
rescue
harry
and
it
was
just
then
that
a
most
extraordinary
thing
occurred
it
happened
so
very
unexpectedly
so
utterly
without
warning
that
it
makes
me
shaky
to
this
day
whenever
i
recall
it
from
the
gem
on
charlotte
finger
or
rather
from
the
air
surrounding
the
ring
came
an
unmistakable
sound
we
saw
nothing
whatever
we
only
heard
and
it
was
clear
as
loud
and
as
startling
as
though
it
had
occurred
right
in
the
room
where
we
were
discussing
the
situation
it
was
the
sharp
joyous
bark
of
a
dog
xx
the
house
of
miracles
looking
back
over
what
has
just
been
written
i
am
sensible
of
a
profound
gratitude
i
am
grateful
both
because
i
have
been
given
the
privilege
of
relating
these
events
and
because
i
shall
not
have
to
leave
this
wilderness
of
facts
for
someone
else
to
explain
really
if
i
did
not
know
that
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
piecing
together
these
phenomena
and
of
setting
my
finger
upon
the
comparatively
simple
explanation
if
i
had
to
go
away
and
leave
this
account
unfinished
a
mere
collection
of
mysteries
i
should
not
speak
at
all
i
should
leave
the
whole
affair
for
another
to
finish
as
it
ought
to
be
finished
all
of
which
it
will
soon
appear
i
am
setting
forth
largely
in
order
to
brace
and
strengthen
myself
against
what
i
must
now
relate
before
resuming
however
i
should
mention
one
detail
which
harry
was
too
modest
to
mention
he
was
or
is
unusually
i
mean
to
claim
that
he
possessed
any
beauty
such
would
gibe
with
a
height
of
five
foot
seven
no
his
good
looks
were
due
to
the
simple
outward
expression
through
his
features
of
a
certain
noble
inward
quality
which
would
have
made
the
homeliest
face
attractive
selfishness
will
spoil
the
handsomest
features
unselfishness
will
glorify
moreover
simply
because
he
had
given
his
word
to
chick
watson
that
he
would
wear
the
ring
harry
took
upon
himself
the
most
dangerous
task
that
any
man
could
assume
and
he
had
lost
but
had
he
known
in
advance
exactly
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
he
would
have
stuck
to
his
word
anyhow
and
since
there
was
a
sporting
risk
attached
to
it
since
the
thing
was
not
perfectly
sure
to
end
tragically
he
probably
enjoyed
the
greater
part
of
his
experience
but
i
not
like
that
frankly
i
an
opportunist
essentially
a
practical
sort
of
fellow
i
have
a
great
admiration
for
idealists
but
a
much
greater
admiration
for
results
for
instance
i
have
seldom
given
my
word
even
though
the
matter
is
unimportant
for
i
will
cheerfully
break
my
word
if
later
on
it
should
develop
that
the
keeping
of
my
word
would
do
more
harm
than
good
i
realise
perfectly
well
that
it
is
dangerous
ground
to
tread
upon
yet
i
must
refer
the
reader
to
what
i
have
accomplished
in
this
world
as
proof
that
my
philosophy
is
not
as
bad
as
it
looks
i
beg
nobody
pardon
for
talking
about
myself
so
much
at
the
outset
this
account
will
be
utterly
incomprehensible
if
i
am
not
understood
my
method
of
solving
the
blind
spot
mystery
is
when
analysed
merely
the
expression
of
my
personality
my
sole
idea
has
been
to
get
results
as
harry
has
put
it
a
proposition
must
be
reduced
to
concrete
form
before
i
will
have
anything
to
do
with
it
if
the
blind
spot
had
been
a
totally
occult
affair
demanding
that
the
investigation
be
conducted
under
cover
of
darkness
surrounded
by
black
velvet
crystal
spheres
and
incense
demanding
the
aid
of
a
clairvoyant
or
other
medium
i
should
never
have
gone
near
it
but
as
soon
as
the
mystery
began
to
manifest
itself
in
terms
that
i
could
understand
appreciate
and
measure
then
i
took
interest
that
is
why
old
professor
holcomb
appealed
to
me
he
had
proposed
that
we
prove
the
occult
by
physical
means
reduce
it
to
the
scope
of
our
five
senses
he
had
said
in
effect
from
that
moment
on
i
was
his
disciple
i
have
told
of
hearing
that
sharp
welcoming
bark
emitted
either
from
the
gem
or
from
the
air
surrounding
it
this
event
took
place
on
the
front
porch
of
the
house
at
chatterton
place
as
charlotte
and
i
sat
there
talking
it
over
we
had
taken
a
suite
at
the
hotel
but
had
come
to
the
house
of
the
blind
spot
in
order
to
decide
upon
a
course
of
action
and
in
a
way
that
mysterious
barking
decided
it
for
us
we
returned
to
the
hotel
and
gave
notice
that
we
would
leave
the
next
day
next
we
began
to
make
preparations
for
moving
into
the
chatterton
place
dwelling
that
afternoon
while
in
the
midst
of
giving
orders
for
furnishings
and
the
like
there
at
the
hotel
i
was
called
to
the
telephone
it
was
from
a
point
outside
the
building
mr
fenton
in
a
man
voice
and
when
i
had
assured
him
you
have
no
reason
to
recognise
my
voice
i
am
rhamda
the
rhamda
what
do
you
want
to
speak
with
your
sister
odd
how
very
agreeable
the
man
tones
will
you
kindly
call
her
to
the
telephone
i
saw
no
objection
however
when
charlotte
came
to
my
side
i
whispered
for
her
to
keep
the
man
waiting
while
i
darted
out
into
the
corridor
and
slipped
downstairs
where
the
girl
at
the
switchboard
put
an
instrument
into
the
circuit
for
me
money
talks
however
my
dear
child
the
voice
of
avec
was
saying
you
do
me
an
injustice
i
have
nothing
but
your
welfare
at
heart
i
assure
you
that
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
and
your
brother
while
at
chatterton
place
it
will
be
through
no
fault
of
mine
at
the
same
time
i
can
positively
assure
you
that
if
you
stay
away
from
there
no
harm
will
come
to
either
of
you
absolutely
none
i
can
guarantee
that
do
ask
me
why
but
if
you
value
your
safety
stay
where
you
are
or
go
elsewhere
anywhere
other
than
to
the
house
in
chatterton
i
can
hardly
agree
with
you
plainly
charlotte
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
man
sincerity
and
earnestness
my
judgment
is
so
much
better
than
mine
that
i
and
she
paused
regretfully
i
only
wish
with
his
remarkable
gracefulness
that
your
intuition
were
as
strong
as
your
loyalty
to
your
brother
if
it
were
you
would
know
that
i
speak
the
truth
when
i
say
that
i
have
only
your
welfare
at
i
i
am
sorry
fortunately
there
is
one
alternative
even
more
agreeable
than
before
if
you
prefer
not
to
take
my
advice
but
cling
to
your
brother
decision
you
can
still
avoid
the
consequences
of
his
determination
to
live
in
that
house
as
i
say
i
can
not
prevent
harm
from
befalling
you
under
present
conditions
but
these
conditions
can
be
completely
altered
if
you
will
make
a
single
concession
miss
what
is
it
eagerly
that
you
give
me
the
ring
he
paused
for
a
very
tense
second
i
wished
i
could
see
his
peculiar
face
the
face
with
the
inscrutable
eyes
the
face
that
urged
rather
than
inspired
both
curiosity
and
confidence
then
he
added
i
know
why
you
wear
it
i
realise
that
the
trinket
carries
some
very
tender
associations
and
i
would
never
ask
such
a
concession
did
i
not
know
were
your
beloved
here
at
this
moment
he
would
endorse
every
word
that
i
say
and
harry
cried
charlotte
her
voice
shaking
he
would
tell
me
to
give
it
to
you
i
am
sure
of
it
it
is
as
though
he
through
me
were
urging
you
to
do
this
for
some
moments
there
was
silence
charlotte
must
have
been
tremendously
impressed
it
certainly
was
amazing
the
degree
of
confidence
that
avec
voice
induced
i
would
have
been
greatly
surprised
had
my
sister
mr
avec
came
charlotte
voice
hesitatingly
almost
sorrowfully
i
i
would
like
to
believe
you
but
but
harry
himself
gave
me
the
ring
and
i
feel
oh
i
sure
that
my
brother
would
never
agree
to
it
i
somehow
the
fellow
managed
to
conceal
any
disappointment
he
may
have
felt
he
contrived
to
show
only
a
deep
sympathy
for
charlotte
as
he
finished
if
i
find
it
possible
to
protect
you
i
shall
miss
after
it
was
all
over
and
i
returned
to
the
rooms
charlotte
and
i
concluded
that
it
might
have
been
better
had
we
made
some
sort
of
compromise
if
we
had
made
a
partial
concession
he
might
have
told
us
something
of
the
mystery
we
ought
to
have
bargained
we
decided
that
if
he
made
any
attempt
to
carry
out
what
i
felt
sure
were
merely
a
thinly
veiled
threat
to
punish
us
for
keeping
the
gem
we
must
not
only
be
ready
for
whatever
he
might
do
but
try
to
trap
and
keep
him
as
well
that
same
day
found
us
back
at
chatterton
place
inside
there
was
altogether
too
much
evidence
that
the
place
had
been
quarters
the
first
step
was
to
clean
up
we
hired
lots
of
help
and
made
a
quick
thorough
job
of
both
floors
the
basement
we
left
untouched
and
the
next
day
we
put
a
force
of
painters
and
decorators
to
work
whereby
hangs
the
tale
mr
fenton
called
the
head
painter
as
he
varnished
the
trim
in
the
parlour
i
wish
you
come
and
see
what
to
make
of
i
stepped
into
the
front
room
he
was
pointing
to
the
long
piece
of
finish
which
spanned
the
doorway
leading
into
the
and
he
indicated
a
spot
almost
in
the
exact
middle
a
spot
covering
a
space
about
five
inches
broad
and
as
high
as
the
width
of
the
wood
in
outline
it
was
roughly
octagonal
i
been
trying
my
best
stated
johnson
to
varnish
that
spot
for
the
past
five
minutes
but
i
be
darned
if
i
can
do
it
and
he
showed
what
he
meant
every
other
part
of
the
door
glistened
with
freshly
applied
varnish
but
the
octagonal
region
remained
dull
as
though
no
liquid
had
ever
touched
it
johnson
dipped
his
brush
into
the
can
and
applied
a
liberal
smear
of
the
fluid
to
the
place
instantly
the
stuff
disappeared
blamed
porous
piece
of
wood
eyeing
me
queerly
or
do
you
think
merely
porous
fenton
for
answer
i
took
a
brush
and
repeatedly
daubed
the
place
it
was
like
dropping
ink
on
a
blotter
the
wood
sucked
up
the
varnish
as
a
desert
might
suck
up
water
there
about
a
quart
of
varnish
in
the
wood
already
observed
johnson
as
i
stared
and
pondered
suppose
we
take
it
down
and
weigh
it
inside
of
a
minute
we
had
that
piece
of
trim
down
from
its
place
first
i
carefully
examined
the
timber
framework
behind
expecting
to
see
traces
of
the
varnish
where
presumably
it
had
seeped
through
there
was
no
sign
then
i
inspected
the
reverse
side
of
the
finish
just
behind
the
peculiar
spot
i
thought
i
might
see
a
region
of
wide
open
pores
in
the
grain
of
the
pine
but
the
back
looked
exactly
the
same
as
the
front
with
no
difference
in
the
grain
at
any
place
placing
the
finish
right
side
up
i
proceeded
to
daub
the
spot
some
more
there
was
no
change
in
the
results
at
last
i
took
the
can
and
without
stopping
poured
a
quart
and
a
half
of
the
fluid
into
that
paradoxical
little
area
well
i
be
darned
very
loudly
from
johnson
but
when
i
looked
up
i
saw
his
face
was
white
and
his
lips
shaking
his
nerves
were
all
to
give
his
mind
a
rest
i
sent
him
for
a
hatchet
when
he
came
back
his
face
had
regained
its
colour
i
directed
him
to
hold
the
pine
upright
while
i
with
a
single
stroke
sank
the
tool
into
the
end
of
the
wood
it
split
part
way
a
jerk
and
the
wood
fell
in
two
halves
well
from
johnson
blankly
perfectly
normal
wood
i
had
to
admit
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
the
material
which
constituted
the
peculiar
spot
from
that
which
surrounded
it
i
sent
johnson
after
more
varnish
also
i
secured
several
other
fluids
including
water
milk
ink
and
machine
oil
and
when
the
painter
returned
we
proceeded
with
a
very
thorough
test
indeed
presently
it
became
clear
that
we
were
dealing
with
a
phenomenon
of
the
blind
spot
all
told
we
poured
about
nine
pints
of
liquid
into
an
area
of
about
twenty
square
inches
all
on
the
outer
surface
for
the
split
side
would
absorb
nothing
and
to
all
appearances
we
might
have
continued
to
pour
indefinitely
ten
minutes
later
i
went
down
into
the
basement
to
dispose
of
some
rubbish
charlotte
did
know
of
this
defection
in
our
housekeeping
it
was
bright
sunlight
outside
thanks
to
the
basement
windows
i
needed
no
artificial
luminant
and
when
my
gaze
rested
upon
the
ground
directly
under
the
parlour
i
saw
something
there
that
i
most
certainly
had
never
noticed
before
the
fact
is
the
basement
at
chatterton
place
never
did
possess
anything
worthy
of
special
notice
except
for
the
partition
which
harry
wendel
and
jerome
the
detective
were
the
first
in
years
to
penetrate
except
for
that
secret
doorway
there
was
nothing
down
there
to
attract
attention
to
be
sure
there
was
a
quantity
of
earth
the
result
of
jerome
vigorous
efforts
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was
any
connection
between
the
blind
spot
phenomena
which
he
had
witnessed
and
the
cellar
he
had
secured
nothing
but
an
appetite
for
all
his
digging
however
it
was
still
too
dark
for
me
to
identify
what
i
saw
at
once
i
stood
for
a
few
moments
accustoming
my
eyes
to
the
light
except
that
the
thing
gleamed
oddly
like
a
piece
of
glass
and
that
it
possessed
a
nearly
circular
outline
about
two
feet
across
i
could
tell
much
about
it
then
i
stooped
and
examined
it
closely
at
once
i
became
conscious
of
a
smell
which
somehow
i
had
hitherto
not
noticed
small
wonder
it
was
as
indescribable
a
smell
as
one
could
imagine
it
seemed
to
be
a
combination
of
several
that
are
not
generally
combined
next
instant
it
flashed
upon
me
that
the
predominating
odour
was
a
familiar
one
i
had
been
smelling
it
in
fact
all
the
morning
but
this
did
not
prevent
me
from
feeling
very
queer
indeed
as
i
realised
what
lay
before
me
a
curious
chill
passed
around
my
shoulders
and
i
scarcely
breathed
at
my
feet
lay
a
pool
composed
of
all
the
various
liquids
that
had
been
poured
upstairs
into
that
baffling
spot
in
the
wood
xxi
out
of
thin
air
except
for
the
incident
just
related
when
several
pints
of
very
real
fluids
were
somehow
materialised
at
a
spot
ten
feet
below
where
they
had
vanished
nothing
worth
recording
occurred
during
the
first
seven
days
of
our
stay
at
chatterton
place
seemingly
nothing
was
to
come
of
the
rhamda
warning
on
the
other
hand
we
succeeded
during
that
week
in
working
a
complete
transformation
of
the
old
house
it
became
one
of
the
brightest
spots
in
san
francisco
it
cost
a
good
deal
of
money
all
told
but
i
could
well
afford
it
i
possessed
the
hundred
thousand
with
which
i
had
promised
myself
and
harry
i
should
solve
the
blind
spot
that
was
what
the
money
was
for
on
the
seventh
day
after
the
night
of
harry
going
our
household
was
increased
to
three
members
for
it
was
then
that
jerome
returned
from
nevada
whence
he
had
gone
two
weeks
before
on
a
case
not
at
all
surprised
he
commented
when
i
told
him
of
disappearance
sorry
i
was
here
that
crook
rhamda
avec
in
at
the
end
he
gnawed
stolidly
at
his
cigar
as
i
told
him
the
story
then
after
briefly
approving
what
i
had
done
to
brighten
the
house
he
announced
tell
you
what
i
got
a
little
money
out
of
that
nevada
case
going
to
take
another
vacation
and
see
this
thing
we
shook
hands
on
this
and
he
moved
right
into
his
old
room
i
felt
in
fact
mighty
glad
to
have
jerome
with
us
although
he
lacked
a
regular
academic
training
he
was
fifteen
years
my
senior
and
because
of
contact
with
a
wide
variety
of
people
in
his
work
both
and
reserved
in
his
judgment
he
could
not
be
stampeded
he
had
courage
and
above
everything
else
he
had
the
burning
curiosity
of
which
harry
has
written
i
was
upstairs
when
he
unpacked
and
i
noted
among
his
belongings
a
large
rather
heavy
automatic
pistol
he
nodded
when
i
asked
if
he
was
willing
to
use
it
in
this
case
although
unbuttoning
his
waistcoat
i
do
pin
as
much
faith
to
pistols
as
i
used
to
the
rhamda
is
i
convinced
the
very
cleverest
proposition
that
ever
lived
he
has
means
to
handle
practically
anything
in
the
way
of
jerome
knew
how
the
fellow
had
worsted
harry
and
me
i
should
wonder
if
he
can
read
the
mind
to
some
extent
he
might
be
able
to
foresee
that
i
was
going
to
draw
a
gun
and
beat
me
to
it
with
some
new
weapon
of
his
having
unbuttoned
his
waistcoat
jerome
then
displayed
a
curious
contrivance
mounted
upon
his
breast
it
consisted
of
a
broad
metal
plate
strapped
across
his
shirt
and
affixed
to
this
plate
was
a
arrangement
for
firing
simultaneously
the
contents
of
a
revolver
cylinder
to
show
how
it
worked
jerome
removed
the
five
cartridges
and
then
faced
me
tell
me
to
throw
up
my
hands
directed
he
i
did
so
his
palms
flew
into
the
air
and
with
a
steely
snap
the
mechanism
was
released
had
there
been
cartridges
in
it
i
should
have
been
riddled
for
i
stood
right
in
front
and
i
shuddered
as
i
noted
the
small
straps
around
jerome
wrists
running
up
his
sleeves
so
disposed
that
the
act
of
surrendering
meant
instant
death
to
him
who
might
demand
may
not
be
ethical
fenton
quietly
but
it
certainly
is
good
sense
to
shoot
first
and
explain
later
when
you
handling
a
chap
like
avec
better
make
preparations
i
objected
i
pointed
out
what
i
have
already
mentioned
that
together
with
the
ring
the
rhamda
offered
our
only
clues
to
the
blind
spot
destroy
the
man
and
we
would
destroy
one
of
our
two
hopes
of
rescuing
our
friends
from
the
unthinkable
fate
that
had
overtaken
them
no
decisively
we
do
want
to
kill
we
want
to
keep
him
bullets
wo
do
i
see
no
reason
however
why
you
should
load
that
thing
with
cartridges
containing
chemicals
which
would
have
an
effect
similar
to
that
of
a
gas
bomb
once
you
can
make
him
helpless
so
that
you
can
put
those
steel
bracelets
on
him
we
see
how
dangerous
he
is
with
his
hands
behind
him
i
get
you
thoughtfully
i
know
a
chemist
who
will
make
up
gas
for
me
in
the
form
of
gelatine
capsules
shoot
at
the
rhamda
burst
upon
striking
safe
enough
for
me
and
yet
put
him
out
of
business
long
enough
to
fit
him
with
the
that
the
but
i
had
other
notions
about
handling
the
rhamda
being
satisfied
that
mere
strength
and
agility
were
valueless
against
him
i
concluded
that
he
likewise
realising
this
would
be
on
the
lookout
for
any
possible
trap
consequently
if
i
hoped
to
keep
the
man
and
force
him
to
tell
us
what
we
wanted
to
know
then
i
must
make
use
of
something
other
than
physical
means
moreover
i
gave
him
credit
for
an
exceptional
amount
of
insight
call
it
or
what
you
will
the
fellow
intellect
was
transcendental
once
having
decided
that
it
must
be
a
battle
of
wits
i
took
a
step
which
may
seem
at
first
a
little
peculiar
i
called
upon
a
certain
lady
to
whom
i
shall
give
the
name
of
clarke
since
that
is
not
the
correct
one
i
took
her
fully
and
frankly
into
my
confidence
it
is
the
only
way
when
dealing
with
a
practitioner
and
since
like
most
of
my
fellow
citizens
she
had
heard
something
of
the
come
and
go
elusive
habits
of
our
men
together
with
the
holcomb
affair
it
was
easy
for
her
to
understand
just
what
i
wanted
i
see
she
mused
you
wish
to
be
surrounded
by
an
influence
that
will
not
so
much
protect
you
as
vitalise
and
strengthen
you
whenever
you
come
in
contact
with
avec
it
will
be
a
simple
matter
how
far
do
you
wish
to
go
and
thus
it
was
arranged
the
plan
calling
for
the
of
some
twenty
of
her
colleagues
my
fellow
engineers
may
sneer
if
they
like
i
know
the
usual
notion
that
the
power
of
mind
over
matter
is
all
in
the
brain
of
the
patient
that
the
efforts
of
the
practitioner
are
merely
inductive
and
so
on
but
i
think
that
the
most
sceptical
will
agree
that
i
did
quite
right
in
seeking
whatever
support
i
could
get
before
crossing
swords
with
a
man
as
keen
as
avec
nevertheless
before
an
opportunity
arrived
to
make
use
of
the
intellectual
machinery
which
my
money
had
started
into
operation
something
occurred
which
almost
threw
the
whole
thing
out
of
gear
it
was
the
evening
after
i
had
returned
from
miss
clarke
office
both
charlotte
and
i
had
a
premonition
after
supper
that
things
were
going
to
happen
we
all
went
into
the
parlour
sat
down
and
waited
presently
we
started
the
gramophone
jerome
sat
nearest
the
instrument
where
he
could
without
rising
lean
over
and
change
the
records
and
all
three
of
us
recall
that
the
selection
being
played
at
the
moment
was
i
am
climbing
mountains
a
sentimental
little
melody
sung
by
a
popular
tenor
certainly
the
piece
was
far
from
being
melancholy
mysterious
or
otherwise
likely
to
attract
the
occult
i
remember
that
we
played
it
twice
and
it
was
just
as
the
singer
reached
the
beginning
of
the
final
chorus
that
charlotte
who
sat
nearest
the
door
made
a
quick
move
and
shivered
as
though
with
cold
from
where
i
sat
near
the
door
i
could
see
through
into
the
hall
charlotte
action
made
me
think
that
the
door
might
have
become
unlatched
allowing
a
draught
to
come
through
afterwards
she
said
that
she
had
felt
something
rather
like
a
breeze
pass
her
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
long
massive
table
of
conventional
library
type
overhead
was
a
heavy
burnished
copper
fixture
from
which
a
cluster
of
electric
bulbs
threw
their
brilliance
upward
so
that
the
room
was
evenly
lighted
with
the
diffused
rays
as
reflected
from
the
ceiling
thus
there
were
no
shadows
to
confuse
the
problem
the
chorus
of
the
song
was
almost
through
when
i
heard
from
the
direction
of
the
table
a
faint
sound
as
though
someone
had
drawn
fingers
lightly
across
the
polished
oak
i
listened
the
sound
was
not
repeated
at
least
not
loud
enough
for
me
to
catch
it
above
the
music
next
moment
however
the
record
came
to
an
end
jerome
leaned
forward
to
put
on
another
and
charlotte
opened
her
mouth
as
though
to
suggest
what
the
new
selection
might
be
but
she
never
said
the
words
it
began
with
a
scintillating
iridescence
up
on
the
ceiling
not
eight
feet
from
where
i
sat
as
i
looked
the
spot
grew
and
spread
and
flared
out
it
was
blue
like
the
elusive
blue
of
the
gem
only
it
was
more
like
flame
the
flame
of
electrical
apparatus
then
down
from
that
blinding
radiance
there
crept
rather
than
dropped
a
single
thread
of
incandescence
vivid
with
a
tinge
of
the
colour
from
which
it
had
surged
down
it
crept
to
the
floor
it
was
like
an
irregular
streak
of
lightning
hanging
motionless
between
ceiling
and
floor
just
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
all
in
total
silence
and
then
the
radiance
vanished
disappeared
snuffed
out
as
one
might
snuff
out
a
candle
and
in
its
stead
there
appeared
a
fourth
person
in
the
room
xxii
the
rousing
of
a
mind
it
was
a
girl
not
the
nervina
no
this
girl
was
quite
another
person
even
now
i
find
it
curiously
hard
to
describe
her
for
me
to
say
that
she
was
the
picture
of
innocence
of
purity
and
of
youth
is
still
to
leave
unsaid
the
secret
of
her
loveliness
for
this
stranger
coming
out
of
the
thin
air
into
our
midst
held
me
with
a
glorious
fascination
from
the
first
i
felt
no
misgivings
such
as
harry
confesses
he
experienced
when
he
fell
under
the
charm
i
knew
as
i
watched
the
stranger
wondering
puzzled
features
that
i
had
never
before
seen
anyone
so
lovely
so
attractive
and
so
utterly
beyond
suspicion
it
was
only
later
that
i
noted
her
amazingly
delicate
complexion
fair
as
her
hair
was
golden
her
deep
blue
eyes
round
face
and
the
girlish
supple
figure
or
her
garments
of
very
soft
white
material
for
she
commenced
almost
instantly
to
talk
but
we
understood
only
with
the
greatest
of
difficulty
she
spoke
as
might
one
who
after
living
in
perfect
solitude
for
a
score
of
years
is
suddenly
called
upon
to
use
language
and
i
remembered
that
rhamda
avec
had
told
jerome
that
he
had
only
begun
the
use
of
language
who
are
you
was
her
first
remark
in
the
sweetest
voice
conceivable
but
there
was
both
fear
and
anxiety
in
her
manner
how
did
i
get
here
you
came
out
of
the
blind
spot
i
spoke
jerking
out
the
words
nervously
and
as
i
saw
too
rapidly
i
repeated
them
more
slowly
but
she
did
not
comprehend
the
blind
spot
she
pondered
what
is
that
next
instant
before
i
could
think
to
warn
her
the
room
trembled
with
the
terrific
clang
of
the
blind
spot
bell
just
one
overwhelming
peal
no
more
at
the
same
time
there
came
a
revival
of
the
luminous
spot
in
the
ceiling
but
with
the
last
tones
of
the
bell
the
spot
faded
to
nothing
the
girl
was
pitifully
frightened
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
steadied
her
with
one
hand
something
that
i
had
not
dared
to
do
as
long
as
the
spot
remained
open
the
touch
of
my
fingers
as
she
swayed
had
the
effect
of
bringing
her
to
herself
she
listened
intelligently
to
what
i
said
the
blind
spot
speaking
with
the
utmost
care
is
the
name
we
have
given
to
a
certain
mystery
it
is
always
marked
by
the
sound
you
have
just
heard
that
bell
always
rings
when
the
phenomenon
is
at
an
and
the
phenomenon
uttering
the
word
with
difficulty
what
is
that
you
i
returned
up
till
now
three
human
beings
have
disappeared
into
what
we
call
the
blind
spot
you
are
the
first
to
be
seen
coming
out
of
hobart
interrupted
charlotte
coming
to
my
side
let
i
stepped
back
and
charlotte
quietly
passed
an
arm
round
the
waist
together
they
stepped
over
to
charlotte
chair
i
noted
the
odd
way
in
which
the
newcomer
walked
unsteadily
uncertainly
like
a
child
taking
its
first
steps
i
glanced
at
jerome
wondering
if
this
tallied
with
what
he
recalled
of
the
rhamda
and
he
gave
a
short
nod
do
be
frightened
said
charlotte
softly
we
are
your
friends
in
a
way
we
have
been
expecting
you
and
we
shall
see
to
it
that
no
harm
comes
to
you
which
would
you
prefer
to
ask
questions
or
to
answer
them
i
the
girl
hesitated
i
hardly
know
perhaps
you
had
better
ask
something
good
do
you
remember
where
you
came
from
can
you
recall
the
events
just
prior
to
your
arrival
here
the
girl
looked
helplessly
from
the
one
to
the
other
of
us
she
seemed
to
be
searching
for
some
clue
finally
she
shook
her
head
in
a
hopeless
despairing
fashion
i
ca
remember
speaking
with
a
shade
less
difficulty
the
last
thing
i
recall
is
seeing
you
three
staring
at
this
was
a
poser
to
think
a
person
who
before
our
very
eyes
had
materialised
out
of
the
blind
spot
was
unable
to
tell
us
anything
about
it
still
this
lack
of
memory
might
be
only
a
temporary
condition
brought
on
by
the
special
conditions
under
which
she
had
emerged
an
as
it
were
of
the
phenomena
and
it
turned
out
that
i
was
right
then
suggested
charlotte
suppose
you
ask
us
the
girl
eyes
stopped
roving
and
rested
definitely
steadily
upon
my
own
and
she
spoke
still
a
little
hesitantly
who
are
you
what
is
your
name
name
taken
wholly
by
surprise
ah
it
is
hobart
fenton
and
automatically
this
is
my
sister
charlotte
the
gentleman
over
there
is
i
am
glad
to
know
you
hobart
with
perfect
simplicity
and
apparent
pleasure
and
you
charlotte
passing
an
arm
round
my
sister
neck
and
you
evidently
she
thought
the
title
of
mister
to
be
jerome
first
name
then
she
went
on
to
say
her
eyes
coming
back
to
mine
why
do
you
look
at
me
that
way
hobart
just
like
that
i
felt
my
cheeks
go
hot
and
cold
by
turns
for
a
moment
i
was
helpless
then
i
made
up
my
mind
to
be
just
as
frank
and
candid
as
she
because
you
so
good
to
look
at
i
blurted
out
i
never
appreciated
my
eyesight
as
i
do
right
now
i
am
glad
she
returned
simply
and
absolutely
without
a
trace
of
confusion
or
resentment
i
know
that
i
rather
like
to
look
at
you
another
stunned
silence
and
this
time
i
did
notice
any
change
in
the
temperature
of
my
face
i
was
too
busily
engaged
in
searching
the
depths
of
those
warm
blue
eyes
she
did
blush
or
even
drop
her
eyes
she
smiled
however
a
gentle
tremulous
smile
that
showed
some
deep
feeling
behind
her
unwavering
gaze
i
recovered
myself
with
a
start
drew
my
chair
up
in
front
of
her
and
took
both
her
hands
firmly
in
mine
whereupon
my
resolution
nearly
deserted
me
how
warm
and
soft
and
altogether
adorable
they
were
i
drew
a
long
breath
and
began
my
dear
by
the
way
what
is
your
name
i
regretfully
after
a
moment
thought
i
do
know
quite
so
as
though
the
fact
was
commonplace
we
will
have
to
provide
you
with
a
name
any
suggestions
charlotte
hesitated
only
a
second
let
call
her
ariadne
it
was
harry
mother
that
so
fine
do
you
like
the
name
ariadne
yes
both
pleased
and
relieved
at
the
same
time
she
looked
oddly
puzzled
and
i
could
see
her
lips
moving
silently
as
she
repeated
the
name
to
herself
not
for
an
instant
did
i
let
go
of
those
wonderful
fingers
what
i
want
you
to
know
ariadne
is
that
you
have
come
into
a
world
that
is
perhaps
more
or
less
like
the
one
that
you
have
just
left
for
all
i
know
it
is
one
and
the
same
world
only
in
some
fashion
not
yet
understood
you
may
have
transported
yourself
to
this
place
perhaps
not
now
we
call
this
a
room
a
part
of
the
house
outside
is
a
street
that
street
is
one
of
hundreds
in
a
vast
city
which
consists
of
a
multitude
of
such
houses
together
with
other
and
vastly
larger
structures
and
these
structures
all
rest
upon
a
solid
material
which
we
call
the
ground
or
earth
the
fact
that
you
understand
our
language
indicates
that
either
you
have
fallen
heir
to
a
body
and
a
brain
which
are
thoroughly
in
tune
with
ours
or
else
and
please
understand
that
we
know
very
little
of
this
mystery
or
else
your
own
body
has
somehow
become
translated
into
a
condition
which
answers
the
same
purpose
at
any
rate
you
ought
to
comprehend
what
i
mean
by
the
term
do
you
oh
yes
brightly
i
seem
to
understand
everything
you
say
then
there
is
a
corresponding
picture
in
your
mind
to
each
thought
i
have
given
you
i
think
so
not
so
positively
well
hoping
that
i
could
make
it
clear
this
earth
is
formed
in
a
huge
globe
part
of
which
is
covered
by
another
material
which
we
term
water
and
the
portions
which
are
not
so
covered
and
are
capable
of
supporting
the
structures
which
constitute
the
city
we
call
by
still
another
name
can
you
supply
that
name
continents
without
hesitation
fine
this
was
a
starter
anyhow
we
soon
have
your
memory
working
however
what
i
really
began
to
say
is
this
each
of
these
continents
and
they
are
several
in
number
is
inhabited
by
people
more
or
less
like
ourselves
there
is
a
vast
number
all
told
each
is
either
male
or
female
like
ourselves
you
seem
to
take
this
for
granted
however
and
you
will
find
them
all
exceedingly
interesting
now
in
all
fairness
letting
go
her
hands
at
last
you
must
understand
that
there
are
among
the
people
whom
you
have
yet
to
see
great
numbers
who
are
far
more
well
attractive
than
i
am
and
you
must
know
even
taking
my
gaze
away
that
not
all
persons
are
as
friendly
as
we
you
will
find
some
who
are
antagonistic
to
you
and
likely
to
take
advantage
of
well
your
unsophisticated
viewpoint
in
short
desperately
you
must
learn
right
away
not
to
accept
people
without
question
you
must
form
the
habit
of
reserving
judgment
of
waiting
until
you
have
more
facts
before
reaching
an
opinion
of
others
you
must
do
this
as
a
matter
of
and
in
the
interests
of
your
greatest
and
i
stopped
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
over
what
i
said
in
the
end
she
observed
this
seems
reasonable
i
feel
sure
that
wherever
i
came
from
such
advice
would
have
fitted
however
smiling
at
me
in
a
manner
to
which
i
can
give
no
description
other
than
affectionate
i
have
no
doubts
about
you
hobart
i
know
you
are
absolutely
all
and
before
i
could
recover
from
the
bliss
into
which
her
statement
threw
me
she
turned
to
charlotte
with
you
too
charlotte
i
know
i
can
trust
but
when
she
looked
at
jerome
she
commented
i
can
trust
you
mister
too
almost
as
much
but
not
quite
if
you
did
suspect
me
i
could
trust
you
jerome
went
white
he
spoke
for
the
first
time
since
the
girl
coming
how
how
did
you
know
that
i
suspected
you
i
ca
explain
i
do
know
then
wistfully
i
wish
you
would
stop
suspecting
me
mister
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
from
i
know
it
jerome
burst
out
excitedly
apologetically
i
know
it
now
you
all
right
i
satisfied
of
that
from
now
on
she
sighed
in
pure
pleasure
and
she
offered
one
hand
to
jerome
he
took
it
as
though
it
were
a
egg
and
turned
almost
purple
at
the
same
time
the
honest
fervid
manliness
which
backed
the
professional
nature
shone
through
for
the
first
time
in
my
knowledge
of
him
from
that
moment
his
devotion
to
the
girl
was
as
absolute
as
that
of
the
fondest
father
who
ever
lived
well
no
need
to
detail
all
that
was
said
during
the
next
hour
bit
by
bit
we
added
to
the
girl
knowledge
of
the
world
into
which
she
had
emerged
and
bit
by
bit
there
unfolded
in
her
mind
a
corresponding
image
of
the
world
from
which
she
had
come
and
when
for
an
experiment
we
took
her
out
on
the
front
porch
and
showed
her
the
stars
we
were
fairly
amazed
at
the
thoughts
they
aroused
oh
she
cried
in
sheer
rapture
i
know
what
those
are
by
now
she
was
speaking
fairly
well
they
are
stars
then
they
do
look
the
same
they
not
outlined
in
the
same
way
as
i
know
but
they
ca
be
anything
else
not
outlined
the
same
i
took
this
to
be
a
very
significant
fact
what
did
it
mean
look
showing
her
the
constellation
leo
on
the
ecliptic
and
therefore
visible
to
both
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
do
you
recognise
that
yes
decisively
that
is
the
arrangement
but
not
the
appearance
of
the
separate
and
we
found
this
to
be
true
of
the
entire
sky
nothing
was
entirely
familiar
to
her
yet
she
assured
us
the
stars
could
be
nothing
else
her
previous
knowledge
told
her
this
without
explaining
why
and
without
a
hint
as
to
the
reason
for
the
dissimilarity
is
it
possible
said
i
speaking
half
to
myself
that
she
has
come
from
another
planet
for
we
know
that
the
sky
as
seen
from
any
of
the
eight
planets
in
this
solar
system
would
present
practically
the
same
appearance
but
if
viewed
from
a
planet
belonging
to
any
other
the
constellations
would
be
more
or
less
altered
in
their
arrangement
because
of
the
vast
distance
involved
as
for
the
difference
in
the
appearance
of
the
individual
stars
that
might
be
accounted
for
by
a
dissimilarity
in
the
chemical
of
the
atmosphere
ariadne
it
may
be
you
come
from
another
world
no
seemingly
quite
conscious
that
she
was
contradicting
me
for
that
matter
there
was
anything
offensive
about
her
kind
of
frankness
no
hobart
i
feel
too
much
at
home
to
have
come
from
any
other
world
than
this
temporarily
i
was
floored
how
could
she
so
ignorant
of
other
matters
feel
so
sure
of
this
there
was
no
explaining
it
we
went
back
into
the
house
as
it
happened
my
eye
struck
first
the
gramophone
and
it
seemed
a
good
idea
to
test
her
knowledge
with
this
is
this
apparatus
familiar
to
you
no
what
is
it
for
do
you
understand
what
is
meant
by
the
term
yes
with
instant
pleasure
this
is
she
proceeded
without
the
slightest
to
sing
in
a
sweet
clear
soprano
and
treated
us
to
the
chorus
of
i
am
climbing
mountains
good
heavens
gasped
charlotte
what
can
it
mean
for
a
moment
the
explanation
evaded
me
then
i
reasoned
she
must
have
a
memory
of
what
was
being
played
just
before
she
and
to
prove
this
i
picked
out
an
instrumental
piece
which
we
had
not
played
all
the
evening
it
was
the
finale
of
the
overture
to
faust
a
selection
by
the
way
which
was
a
great
favourite
of
harry
and
is
one
of
mine
ariadne
listened
in
silence
to
the
end
i
seem
to
have
heard
something
like
it
before
she
decided
slowly
the
melody
not
the
the
instrumentation
but
it
reminds
me
of
something
that
i
like
very
whereupon
she
began
to
sing
for
us
but
this
time
her
voice
was
stronger
and
more
dramatic
and
as
for
the
composition
all
i
can
say
is
it
had
a
wild
fierce
ring
to
it
like
men
of
harlech
only
the
notes
did
not
correspond
to
the
chromatic
scale
she
sang
in
an
entirely
new
musical
system
by
george
when
she
had
done
now
we
have
got
something
for
the
first
time
we
heard
some
genuine
unadulterated
blind
spot
stuff
you
mean
from
charlotte
excitedly
that
she
has
finally
recovered
her
memory
it
was
the
girl
herself
who
answered
she
shot
to
her
feet
and
her
face
became
transfigured
with
a
wonderful
joy
at
the
same
time
she
blinked
hurriedly
as
though
to
shut
off
a
sight
that
staggered
her
oh
i
remember
she
almost
sobbed
in
her
delight
it
is
all
plain
to
me
now
i
know
who
i
am
xxiii
the
rhamda
again
i
could
have
yelled
for
joy
we
were
about
to
learn
something
of
the
blind
spot
something
that
might
help
us
to
save
harry
and
chick
and
the
professor
ariadne
seemed
to
know
that
a
great
deal
depended
upon
what
she
was
about
to
tell
us
she
deliberately
sat
down
and
rested
her
chin
upon
her
hand
as
though
determining
upon
the
best
way
of
telling
something
very
difficult
to
express
as
for
charlotte
jerry
and
myself
we
managed
somehow
to
restrain
our
curiosity
enough
to
keep
silence
but
we
could
not
help
glancing
more
or
less
wonderingly
at
our
visitor
presently
i
realised
this
and
got
up
and
walked
quietly
about
as
though
intent
upon
a
problem
of
my
own
which
was
true
enough
i
had
come
to
a
very
startling
conclusion
i
hobart
fenton
had
fallen
in
love
what
was
more
this
affection
of
the
heart
had
come
to
me
a
very
strong
man
just
as
an
affection
of
the
lungs
is
said
to
strike
such
men
all
of
a
sudden
and
hard
one
moment
i
had
been
a
sturdy
independent
soul
intent
upon
scientific
investigation
the
only
symptoms
of
sentimental
potentialities
being
my
perfectly
normal
love
for
my
sister
and
for
my
old
friend
then
before
my
very
eyes
i
had
been
smitten
thus
and
the
worst
part
of
it
was
i
found
myself
enjoying
the
sensation
it
made
not
the
slightest
difference
to
me
that
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
girl
who
was
only
a
step
removed
from
a
wraith
mysteriously
she
had
come
to
me
as
mysteriously
she
might
depart
i
had
yet
to
know
from
what
sort
of
country
she
had
come
but
that
made
no
difference
she
was
here
in
the
same
house
with
me
i
had
held
her
hands
and
i
knew
her
to
be
very
very
real
indeed
just
then
and
when
i
considered
the
possibility
of
her
disappearing
just
as
inexplicably
as
she
had
come
well
my
face
went
cold
i
admit
but
at
the
same
time
i
felt
sure
of
this
much
i
should
never
love
any
other
woman
the
thought
left
me
sober
i
paused
in
my
pacing
and
looked
at
her
as
though
in
answer
to
my
gaze
she
glanced
up
and
smiled
so
affectionately
that
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
leaping
forward
and
taking
her
right
into
my
arms
i
turned
hastily
and
to
cover
my
confusion
i
began
to
hum
a
strain
from
the
part
of
faust
to
which
i
have
referred
i
hummed
it
through
and
was
beginning
again
when
i
was
startled
to
hear
this
from
the
girl
oh
then
you
are
hobart
i
wheeled
to
see
her
face
filled
with
a
wonderful
light
hobart
she
repeated
as
one
might
repeat
the
name
of
a
very
dear
one
that
that
music
you
were
humming
why
i
heard
harry
wendel
humming
that
yesterday
i
suppose
we
looked
very
stupid
the
three
of
us
so
dumbfounded
that
we
could
do
nothing
but
gape
incredulously
at
that
extraordinary
creature
and
her
equally
extraordinary
utterance
she
immediately
did
her
best
to
atone
for
her
sensation
i
not
sure
that
i
can
make
it
clear
she
said
smiling
dubiously
but
if
you
will
use
your
imaginations
and
try
to
fill
in
the
gaps
in
what
i
say
you
may
get
a
fair
idea
of
the
place
i
have
come
from
and
where
harry
we
leaned
forward
intensely
alert
i
shall
never
forget
the
pitiful
eagerness
in
poor
charlotte
face
it
meant
more
to
her
perhaps
than
to
anyone
else
at
the
precise
instant
i
heard
a
sound
off
in
the
breakfast
room
it
seemed
to
be
a
subdued
knocking
or
rather
a
pounding
at
the
door
frowning
at
the
interruption
i
stepped
through
the
into
the
breakfast
room
where
the
sounds
came
from
and
i
was
not
a
little
puzzled
to
note
that
the
door
to
the
basement
was
receiving
the
blows
now
i
had
been
the
last
to
visit
the
basement
and
had
locked
the
door
from
force
of
habit
i
suppose
leaving
the
key
in
the
lock
it
was
still
there
and
there
is
but
one
way
to
enter
that
basement
through
this
one
door
and
no
other
who
is
it
i
called
out
peremptorily
no
answer
only
a
repetition
of
the
pounds
what
do
you
want
louder
open
this
door
quick
cane
a
muffled
reply
the
voice
was
unrecognisable
i
stood
and
thought
quickly
then
shouted
wait
a
minute
until
i
get
a
key
i
motioned
to
charlotte
she
to
my
side
i
whispered
something
in
her
ear
and
she
slipped
off
into
the
kitchen
there
to
phone
miss
clarke
and
warn
her
to
notify
her
colleagues
at
once
and
so
as
i
unlocked
the
door
i
was
fortified
by
the
knowledge
that
i
would
be
assisted
by
the
combined
of
a
score
of
highly
developed
intellects
i
was
little
surprised
a
second
later
to
see
that
the
intruder
was
rhamda
avec
what
reason
to
expect
anyone
else
how
did
you
get
down
there
i
demanded
do
you
realise
that
you
are
liable
to
arrest
for
trespass
i
said
it
merely
to
start
conversation
but
it
served
only
to
bring
a
slight
smile
to
the
face
of
this
professed
friend
of
ours
for
whom
we
felt
nothing
but
distrust
and
fear
let
us
not
waste
time
in
trivialities
fenton
he
rejoined
gently
he
brushed
a
fleck
of
cobweb
from
his
coat
by
this
time
you
ought
to
know
that
you
can
not
deal
with
me
in
any
ordinary
i
made
no
comment
as
without
asking
my
leave
or
awaiting
an
invitation
he
stepped
through
into
the
and
thence
into
the
parlour
i
followed
half
tempted
to
strike
him
down
from
behind
but
restrained
more
by
the
fact
that
i
must
spare
him
than
from
any
compunctions
seemingly
he
knew
this
as
well
as
i
he
was
serenely
at
ease
and
thus
he
stood
before
jerome
and
ariadne
the
detective
made
a
single
exclamation
and
furtively
shifted
his
coat
sleeves
he
was
getting
that
infernal
breast
gun
into
action
as
for
ariadne
she
stared
at
the
new
arrival
as
though
astonished
at
first
when
charlotte
returned
a
moment
later
she
showed
only
mild
surprise
she
quietly
took
her
chair
and
as
quietly
moved
her
hand
so
that
the
gem
shone
in
full
view
of
our
visitor
but
he
gave
her
and
the
stone
only
a
single
glance
and
then
rested
his
eyes
upon
our
new
friend
to
my
anxiety
ariadne
was
gazing
fixedly
at
him
now
her
expression
combining
both
agitation
and
a
vague
fear
it
could
not
have
been
due
entirely
to
his
unusual
appearance
for
there
was
no
denying
that
this
yet
man
with
the
distinguished
courteous
bearing
looked
even
younger
that
night
than
ever
before
no
the
girl
concern
was
deeper
more
acute
i
felt
an
unaccountable
alarm
from
ariadne
to
me
the
rhamda
glanced
then
back
again
and
a
quick
satisfied
smile
came
to
his
mouth
he
gave
an
almost
imperceptible
nod
and
keeping
his
gaze
fixed
upon
her
eyes
he
remarked
carelessly
which
of
these
chairs
shall
i
sit
in
fenton
this
one
i
replied
instantly
pointing
to
the
one
i
had
just
quit
smiling
he
selected
a
chair
a
few
feet
away
whereupon
i
congratulated
myself
the
man
feared
me
then
yet
he
ranked
my
mentality
no
higher
than
that
in
other
words
remarkably
clever
though
he
might
be
and
as
yet
unthwarted
he
could
by
no
means
be
called
omnipotent
for
your
benefit
jerome
let
me
say
that
i
phoned
miss
fenton
and
her
brother
a
few
days
ago
and
urged
them
to
give
up
their
notion
of
occupying
this
house
or
of
attempting
to
solve
the
mystery
that
you
are
already
acquainted
with
and
i
prophesied
jerome
that
their
refusal
to
accept
my
advice
would
be
followed
by
events
that
would
justify
me
they
refused
as
you
know
and
i
am
here
tonight
to
make
a
final
plea
so
that
they
may
escape
the
consequences
of
their
you
a
crook
and
the
more
i
see
of
you
avec
the
more
easily
i
can
understand
why
they
turned
you
down
so
you
too
are
prejudiced
against
me
i
can
not
understand
this
my
motives
are
quite
above
question
i
assure
really
i
observed
sarcastically
i
stole
a
glance
at
ariadne
her
eyes
were
still
riveted
in
a
rapt
yet
abstraction
upon
the
face
of
the
rhamda
it
was
time
i
took
her
attention
away
i
called
her
name
she
did
not
move
her
head
or
reply
i
said
it
louder
ariadne
what
is
it
hobart
very
softly
ariadne
this
gentleman
possesses
a
great
deal
of
knowledge
of
the
locality
from
which
you
came
we
are
interested
in
him
because
we
feel
sure
that
if
he
chose
to
he
could
tell
us
something
about
our
friends
who
about
harry
why
not
lay
the
cards
plainly
on
the
table
the
rhamda
must
be
aware
of
it
all
anyhow
and
as
this
man
has
said
he
has
tried
to
prevent
us
from
solving
the
mystery
it
occurs
to
me
ariadne
that
you
might
recognise
this
man
but
apparently
she
shook
her
head
just
perceptibly
i
proceeded
he
is
pleased
to
call
his
warning
a
prophecy
but
we
feel
that
a
threat
is
a
threat
what
he
really
wants
is
that
ariadne
had
already
earlier
in
the
hour
given
the
gem
several
curious
glances
now
she
stirred
and
sighed
and
was
about
to
turn
her
eyes
from
the
rhamda
to
the
ring
when
he
spoke
again
this
time
in
a
voice
as
sharp
as
a
steel
blade
i
do
not
enjoy
being
misunderstood
much
less
being
misrepresented
fenton
at
the
same
time
since
you
have
seen
fit
to
brand
me
in
such
uncomplimentary
terms
suppose
i
state
what
i
have
to
say
very
bluntly
so
that
there
may
be
no
mistake
about
it
if
you
do
not
either
quit
this
house
or
give
up
the
ring
now
you
will
surely
regret
it
the
rest
of
your
lives
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
jerome
moving
slowly
in
his
chair
so
that
he
could
face
directly
towards
the
rhamda
his
hands
were
ready
for
the
swift
upward
jerk
which
i
knew
would
stifle
our
caller
as
for
my
sister
she
merely
turned
the
ring
so
that
the
gem
no
longer
faced
the
rhamda
and
with
the
other
hand
she
reached
out
and
grasped
ariadne
firmly
avec
sat
with
his
two
hands
clasping
the
arms
of
his
chair
his
fingers
drummed
nervously
but
lightly
on
the
wood
and
then
suddenly
they
stopped
their
motion
your
answer
fenton
in
his
usual
gentle
voice
i
can
give
you
no
more
time
i
did
not
need
to
consult
charlotte
or
jerome
i
knew
what
they
would
have
said
you
are
welcome
to
my
answer
it
is
no
as
i
spoke
the
last
word
my
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
rhamda
eyes
he
on
the
other
hand
was
looking
towards
ariadne
and
at
the
very
instant
an
expression
as
of
alarm
and
sorrow
swept
into
the
man
face
my
glance
jumped
to
ariadne
her
eyes
were
closed
her
face
suffused
she
seemed
to
be
suffocating
she
gave
a
queer
little
sound
half
gasp
and
half
cry
simultaneously
jerome
hands
shot
into
the
air
the
room
shivered
with
the
stunning
report
of
his
breast
gun
and
every
pellet
struck
the
rhamda
and
burst
a
look
of
intense
astonishment
came
into
his
face
he
gave
jerome
a
fleeting
glance
almost
of
admiration
then
his
nostrils
contracted
with
pain
as
the
gas
attacked
his
lungs
another
second
and
each
of
us
were
reeling
with
the
fumes
jerome
started
toward
the
window
to
raise
it
then
sank
back
into
his
chair
and
when
he
turned
round
he
and
i
and
charlotte
saw
an
extraordinary
thing
instead
of
succumbing
to
the
gas
rhamda
avec
somehow
recovered
himself
and
while
the
rest
of
us
remained
still
too
numbed
to
move
or
speak
he
found
power
to
do
both
i
warned
you
plainly
fenton
as
though
nothing
in
particular
had
happened
and
now
see
what
you
have
brought
upon
the
poor
child
i
could
only
roll
my
head
stupidly
to
stare
at
ariadne
now
senseless
form
as
usual
fenton
you
will
blame
me
for
it
i
can
not
help
that
but
it
may
still
be
possible
for
you
to
repent
of
your
folly
and
escape
your
fate
you
are
playing
with
terrible
forces
if
you
do
repent
just
follow
these
instructions
laying
a
card
on
the
table
and
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
i
wish
you
all
good
and
with
that
pausing
only
to
make
a
courtly
bow
to
charlotte
rhamda
avec
turned
and
walked
deliberately
dignifiedly
from
the
room
while
the
two
men
and
a
woman
stared
helplessly
after
him
and
allowed
him
to
go
in
peace
xxiv
the
living
death
as
soon
as
the
fresh
air
had
revived
us
somewhat
we
first
of
all
examined
ariadne
she
still
lay
unconscious
very
pale
and
alarmingly
limp
i
picked
her
up
and
carried
her
into
the
next
room
where
there
was
a
sofa
while
jerome
went
for
water
and
charlotte
brought
neither
of
these
had
any
effect
ariadne
seemed
to
be
scarcely
breathing
her
heart
beat
only
faintly
and
there
was
no
response
to
such
other
methods
as
friction
slapping
or
pinching
of
fingernails
we
had
better
call
a
doctor
decided
charlotte
promptly
and
went
to
the
phone
i
picked
up
the
card
which
the
rhamda
had
left
it
contained
simply
his
name
together
with
one
other
word
the
name
of
a
morning
newspaper
evidently
he
meant
for
us
to
insert
an
advertisement
as
soon
as
we
were
ready
to
capitulate
not
yet
the
three
of
us
decided
after
talking
it
over
and
we
waited
as
patiently
as
we
could
during
the
fifteen
minutes
that
elapsed
before
the
telephoning
got
results
it
brought
hansen
who
it
may
be
remembered
was
closely
identified
with
the
chick
watson
disappearance
he
made
a
rapid
but
very
careful
examination
it
has
all
the
appearance
of
a
mild
electric
shock
what
caused
it
fenton
i
told
him
his
eyes
narrowed
when
i
mentioned
avec
then
widened
in
astonishment
and
incredulity
as
i
related
the
man
inexplicable
effect
upon
the
girl
and
his
strange
immunity
to
the
poison
gas
but
the
doctor
asked
nothing
further
about
our
situation
proceeding
at
once
to
apply
several
restoratives
all
were
without
result
as
a
final
resort
he
even
rigged
up
an
electrical
connection
making
use
of
some
coils
which
i
had
upstairs
and
endeavoured
to
arouse
the
girl
in
that
fashion
still
without
result
good
lord
hansen
i
finally
burst
out
when
he
stood
back
apparently
baffled
she
simply
got
to
be
revived
we
ca
allow
her
to
succumb
to
that
scoundrel
power
whatever
it
is
why
not
a
blood
transfusion
i
asked
eagerly
as
an
idea
came
to
me
i
in
perfect
condition
what
about
it
go
to
it
doc
he
slowly
shook
his
head
and
beyond
a
single
searching
glance
into
my
eyes
wherein
he
must
have
read
something
more
than
i
had
said
he
regretfully
replied
this
is
a
case
for
a
specialist
fenton
everything
considered
i
should
say
that
she
is
suffering
from
a
purely
mental
condition
but
whether
it
had
a
physical
or
a
psychic
origin
i
ca
in
short
he
did
not
feel
safe
about
going
ahead
with
any
really
heroic
measures
until
a
brain
specialist
was
called
in
i
had
a
good
deal
of
confidence
in
hansen
and
what
he
said
sounded
reasonable
so
we
agreed
to
his
calling
in
a
higgins
the
same
man
in
fact
who
was
too
late
in
reaching
the
house
to
save
chick
on
that
memorable
night
a
year
before
his
examination
was
swift
and
convincingly
competent
he
went
over
the
same
ground
that
hansen
had
covered
took
the
blood
pressure
and
other
instrumental
data
and
asked
us
several
questions
regarding
mentality
as
we
knew
it
scarcely
stopping
to
think
it
over
higgins
decided
the
young
woman
is
suffering
from
a
temporary
dissociation
of
brain
centres
her
cerebrum
does
not
with
her
cerebellum
in
other
words
her
conscious
mind
for
lack
of
means
to
express
itself
is
for
the
time
being
dormant
as
in
sleep
but
it
is
not
like
ordinary
sleep
such
is
induced
by
fatigue
of
the
nerve
channels
this
young
woman
condition
is
produced
by
shock
and
since
there
was
no
physical
violence
we
must
conclude
that
the
shock
was
psychic
in
that
case
the
condition
will
last
until
one
of
two
things
occurs
either
she
must
be
similarly
shocked
back
into
sensibility
and
i
see
how
this
can
happen
fenton
unless
you
can
secure
the
of
the
man
to
whom
you
attribute
the
matter
or
she
must
lie
that
way
indefinitely
i
exclaimed
sensing
something
ominous
you
mean
that
there
is
no
known
method
of
reviving
a
patient
in
such
a
condition
it
might
be
called
psychic
catalepsy
to
speak
plainly
fenton
unless
this
man
revives
her
she
will
remain
unconscious
until
her
i
shuddered
what
horrible
thing
had
come
into
our
lives
to
afflict
us
with
so
dreadful
a
prospect
is
is
there
no
hope
higgins
very
little
gently
but
decisively
all
i
can
assure
you
is
that
she
will
not
die
immediately
from
the
general
state
of
her
health
she
will
live
at
least
hours
after
that
you
must
be
prepared
for
the
worst
at
any
i
turned
away
quickly
so
that
he
could
not
see
my
face
what
an
awful
situation
unless
we
could
somehow
lay
hands
on
the
rhamda
i
hunted
up
jerome
i
said
jerry
the
thing
is
plainly
up
to
you
and
me
higgins
gives
us
three
days
day
after
tomorrow
morning
if
we
have
got
results
by
that
time
we
got
to
give
in
and
put
that
ad
in
the
paper
but
i
do
mean
to
give
in
jerry
not
until
i
exhausted
every
other
possibility
what
you
going
to
do
he
asked
thoughtfully
work
on
that
ring
i
was
a
fool
not
to
get
busy
sooner
as
for
the
rest
that
up
to
you
you
got
to
get
yourself
on
the
rhamda
trail
as
soon
as
you
can
and
camp
there
the
first
chance
you
get
ransack
his
room
and
belongings
and
bring
me
every
bit
of
data
you
find
between
him
and
the
ring
the
truth
ought
to
come
all
right
but
do
forget
that
pointing
to
the
unexplained
spot
on
the
wood
of
the
doorway
you
got
a
mighty
important
clue
there
waiting
for
you
to
analyse
and
he
went
and
got
his
hat
and
left
the
house
his
final
remark
was
that
we
would
see
him
back
until
he
had
something
to
report
about
our
man
five
the
next
morning
found
my
sister
and
me
out
of
our
beds
and
desperately
busy
she
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
of
course
in
caring
for
ariadne
the
poor
girl
showed
no
improvement
at
all
and
we
got
scant
encouragement
from
the
fact
that
she
looked
no
worse
not
a
sound
escaped
her
lips
her
eyes
remained
closed
she
gave
no
sign
of
life
save
her
barely
perceptible
breathing
it
made
me
sick
at
heart
just
to
look
at
her
so
near
and
yet
so
fearfully
far
away
but
when
charlotte
could
spare
any
time
she
gave
me
considerable
help
in
what
i
was
trying
to
do
one
great
service
she
was
rendering
has
already
been
made
clear
she
wore
the
ring
constantly
thus
relieving
me
of
the
anxiety
of
caring
for
it
i
was
very
cautious
not
to
have
it
in
my
possession
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
my
first
move
was
to
set
down
in
orderly
fashion
the
list
of
the
attributes
i
grouped
together
the
fluctuating
nature
of
its
pale
blue
colour
its
power
of
reproducing
those
who
had
gone
into
the
blind
spot
its
combination
of
perfect
solidity
with
extreme
lightness
its
quality
of
coldness
to
the
touch
of
a
male
and
warmth
to
that
of
a
female
and
finally
its
ability
to
induct
i
think
this
is
the
right
term
to
induct
sounds
out
of
the
unknown
this
last
quality
might
be
called
spasmodic
or
accidental
whereas
the
others
were
permanent
and
constant
now
to
this
list
i
presently
was
able
to
add
that
the
gem
possessed
no
radioactive
properties
that
i
could
detect
with
the
usual
means
it
was
only
when
i
began
dabbling
in
chemistry
that
i
learned
things
by
placing
the
gem
inside
a
glass
bell
and
exhausting
as
much
air
as
possible
from
around
it
the
way
was
cleared
for
introducing
other
forms
of
gases
whereupon
i
discovered
this
the
stone
will
absorb
any
given
quantity
of
hydrogen
gas
in
this
respect
it
behaves
analogously
to
that
curious
place
on
the
only
it
absorbs
gas
no
liquid
and
not
any
gas
either
none
but
hydrogen
now
obviously
this
gem
can
not
truly
absorb
so
much
material
in
the
sense
of
retaining
it
as
well
the
simple
test
of
weighing
it
afterwards
proves
this
for
its
weight
remains
the
same
in
any
circumstances
moreover
unlike
the
liquids
which
i
poured
into
the
wood
and
saw
afterwards
in
the
basement
the
gas
does
not
escape
back
into
the
air
i
kept
it
under
the
dell
long
enough
to
be
sure
of
that
no
that
hydrogen
is
manifestly
translated
into
the
blind
spot
learning
nothing
further
about
the
gem
at
that
time
i
proceeded
to
investigate
the
trim
of
the
door
i
began
by
trying
to
find
out
the
precise
thickness
of
that
layer
to
do
this
i
scraped
off
the
skin
of
the
wood
this
layer
was
of
an
inch
thick
and
that
was
the
total
amount
of
the
active
material
i
put
these
scrapings
through
a
long
list
of
experiments
they
told
me
nothing
valuable
i
learned
only
one
detail
worth
mentioning
if
a
fragment
of
the
scrapings
be
brought
near
to
the
holcomb
gem
say
to
within
two
inches
the
scrapings
will
burst
into
flame
it
is
merely
a
bright
pinkish
flare
like
that
made
by
smokeless
no
ashes
remain
after
that
we
took
care
not
to
bring
the
ring
near
the
remaining
material
on
the
board
all
this
occurred
on
the
first
day
after
ariadne
was
stricken
jerome
phoned
to
say
that
he
had
engaged
the
services
of
a
dozen
private
detectives
and
expected
to
get
wind
of
the
rhamda
any
hour
both
hansen
and
higgins
called
twice
without
being
able
to
detect
any
change
for
the
better
or
otherwise
in
their
patient
that
evening
charlotte
and
i
concluded
that
we
could
not
hold
out
any
longer
we
must
give
in
to
the
rhamda
i
phoned
for
a
messenger
and
sent
an
advertisement
to
the
newspaper
which
avec
had
indicated
the
thing
was
done
we
had
capitulated
the
next
development
would
be
another
and
triumphant
call
from
the
rhamda
and
this
time
we
would
have
to
give
up
the
gem
to
him
if
we
were
to
save
ariadne
the
game
was
up
but
instead
of
taking
the
matter
philosophically
i
worried
about
it
all
night
i
told
myself
again
and
again
that
i
was
foolish
to
think
about
something
that
could
be
helped
why
not
forget
it
and
go
to
sleep
but
somehow
i
could
i
lay
wide
awake
till
long
past
midnight
finding
myself
growing
more
and
more
nervous
at
last
such
was
the
tension
of
it
all
i
got
up
and
dressed
it
was
then
about
and
i
stepped
out
on
the
street
for
a
walk
half
an
hour
later
i
returned
my
lungs
full
of
fresh
air
hoping
that
i
could
now
sleep
it
was
only
a
hope
never
have
i
felt
wider
awake
than
i
did
then
once
more
about
three
i
took
another
stroll
outside
i
seemed
absolutely
tireless
each
time
that
i
had
turned
back
home
i
seemed
to
feel
stronger
than
ever
more
wakeful
finally
i
dropped
the
idea
altogether
went
to
the
house
and
left
a
note
for
charlotte
then
walked
down
to
the
waterfront
and
watched
some
ships
taking
advantage
of
the
tide
anything
to
pass
the
time
and
thus
it
happened
that
about
eight
breakfast
time
at
chatterton
place
i
returned
to
the
house
and
sat
down
at
the
table
with
charlotte
first
however
i
opened
the
morning
paper
to
read
our
little
ad
it
was
not
there
it
had
not
been
printed
xxv
at
the
eleventh
hour
i
dropped
the
paper
in
dismay
charlotte
looked
up
startled
gave
me
a
single
look
and
turned
pale
what
what
the
matter
she
stammered
fearfully
i
showed
her
then
i
ran
to
the
phone
in
a
few
seconds
i
was
talking
to
the
very
man
who
had
taken
the
note
from
the
messenger
the
day
before
yes
i
handed
it
in
along
with
the
rest
he
replied
to
my
excited
query
then
wait
a
minute
said
he
and
a
moment
later
added
say
fenton
i
made
a
mistake
here
the
darned
ad
on
the
counter
it
must
have
slipped
under
the
i
went
back
and
told
charlotte
we
stared
at
one
another
blankly
why
in
the
name
of
all
that
was
baffling
had
our
ad
slipped
under
that
blotter
and
what
were
we
to
do
this
was
the
second
day
well
we
did
what
we
could
we
arranged
for
the
insertion
of
the
same
notice
in
each
of
the
three
afternoon
papers
there
would
still
be
time
for
the
rhamda
to
act
if
he
saw
it
the
hours
dragged
by
never
did
time
pass
more
slowly
and
yet
i
begrudged
every
one
so
much
for
being
absolutely
helpless
about
ten
the
next
morning
that
is
to
say
today
i
am
writing
this
the
same
evening
the
front
door
bell
rang
charlotte
answered
and
in
a
moment
came
back
with
a
card
it
read
sir
henry
hodges
i
nearly
upset
the
table
in
my
excitement
i
ran
into
the
hall
who
would
sir
henry
hodges
the
english
scientist
about
whom
the
whole
world
was
talking
the
most
gifted
investigator
of
the
day
the
most
widely
informed
of
all
men
on
the
face
of
the
globe
the
best
equipped
mentally
to
explore
the
unknown
without
the
slightest
formality
i
grabbed
his
hand
and
shook
it
until
he
smiled
at
my
enthusiasm
my
dear
sir
henry
i
told
him
i
immensely
glad
to
see
you
the
truth
is
i
been
hoping
you
be
interested
in
our
case
but
i
have
the
nerve
to
bother
you
with
it
and
i
he
admitted
in
his
quiet
way
have
been
longing
to
take
a
hand
in
it
ever
since
i
first
heard
of
professor
holcomb
disappearance
did
like
to
offer
myself
understood
that
the
matter
had
been
hushed
up
and
for
the
very
simple
reason
i
explained
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
publicity
if
we
had
given
the
public
the
facts
we
would
have
been
swamped
with
volunteers
to
help
us
i
did
know
whom
to
confide
in
sir
henry
could
make
up
my
mind
i
only
knew
that
one
such
man
as
yourself
was
just
what
i
he
overlooked
the
compliment
and
pulled
out
the
newspaper
from
his
pocket
bought
this
a
few
minutes
ago
saw
your
ad
and
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
matters
had
reached
an
acute
stage
let
me
have
the
whole
story
my
boy
as
briefly
as
you
he
already
knew
the
published
details
also
he
seemed
to
be
acquainted
in
some
manner
which
puzzled
me
with
much
that
had
not
been
printed
i
sketched
the
affair
as
quickly
as
i
could
making
it
clear
that
we
were
face
to
face
with
a
crisis
when
i
wound
up
by
saying
that
it
was
higgins
who
gave
ariadne
three
days
ending
about
midnight
in
which
she
might
recover
if
we
could
secure
rhamda
avec
he
said
kindly
i
afraid
you
made
a
mistake
my
boy
in
not
seeking
some
help
the
game
has
reached
a
point
where
you
can
not
have
too
many
brains
on
your
side
time
is
short
for
reinforcements
he
heartily
approved
of
my
course
in
enlisting
the
aid
of
miss
clarke
and
her
colleagues
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
need
people
with
mentality
plenty
of
intellectual
force
and
he
went
on
to
make
suggestions
as
a
result
within
an
hour
and
a
half
our
house
was
sheltering
five
more
persons
miss
clarke
has
already
been
introduced
she
was
easily
one
of
the
ten
most
advanced
practitioners
in
her
line
and
she
had
the
advantage
of
a
curiosity
that
was
interested
in
everything
odd
even
though
she
labelled
it
she
said
it
helped
her
faith
in
the
real
truths
to
be
conversant
with
the
unreal
malloy
was
from
the
university
an
materialist
a
psychologist
who
made
life
interesting
for
those
who
agreed
with
william
james
his
investigations
of
abnormal
psychology
are
mme
le
fabre
we
afterwards
learned
had
come
from
versailles
especially
to
investigate
the
matter
that
was
bothering
us
she
possessed
no
mediumistic
properties
of
her
own
but
was
a
staunch
proponent
of
spiritualism
believing
firmly
in
immortality
and
the
omnipotence
of
translated
souls
professor
herold
is
most
widely
known
as
the
inventor
of
certain
apparatus
connected
with
wireless
but
he
is
also
considered
the
most
advanced
student
of
electrical
and
subjects
i
was
enormously
glad
to
have
this
man
expert
knowledge
right
on
tap
the
remaining
member
of
the
quintet
which
sir
henry
advised
me
to
summon
requires
a
little
explanation
also
i
am
obliged
to
give
him
a
name
not
his
own
for
it
is
not
often
that
of
the
united
states
army
can
openly
lend
their
names
to
anything
so
far
removed
apparently
from
militarism
as
the
searching
of
the
occult
yet
we
knew
that
this
man
possessed
a
power
that
few
scientists
have
developed
the
power
of
of
handling
and
balancing
great
facts
and
forces
and
of
deciding
promptly
how
best
to
meet
any
given
situation
not
that
we
looked
for
anything
militaristic
out
of
the
blind
spot
far
from
it
we
merely
knew
not
what
to
expect
which
was
exactly
why
we
wanted
to
have
him
with
us
his
type
of
mind
is
perhaps
the
most
solidly
comforting
sort
that
any
person
can
have
at
his
side
by
the
time
these
five
had
gathered
jerome
had
neither
returned
nor
telephoned
there
was
not
the
slightest
trace
of
rhamda
avec
no
guessing
as
to
whether
he
had
seen
the
ad
it
was
then
one
in
the
afternoon
only
six
hours
ago
it
does
seem
possible
so
there
were
eight
of
us
three
women
and
five
men
who
went
upstairs
and
quietly
inspected
the
all
but
lifeless
form
of
ariadne
and
afterwards
gathered
in
the
library
below
all
were
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
situation
miss
clarke
calmly
commented
to
the
effect
that
the
entire
blind
spot
affair
was
due
wholly
and
simply
to
the
cumulative
effects
of
so
many
many
subjects
the
result
in
other
words
of
error
malloy
was
equally
outspoken
in
his
announcement
that
he
proposed
to
deal
with
the
matter
from
the
standpoint
of
psychic
aberration
he
mentioned
dissociated
personalities
group
hypnosis
and
so
on
but
he
declared
that
he
was
open
to
conviction
and
anxious
to
get
any
and
all
facts
sir
henry
had
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
in
getting
mme
le
fabre
to
commit
herself
probably
she
felt
that
since
sir
henry
had
gone
on
record
as
being
doubtful
of
the
spiritistic
explanation
of
psychic
phenomena
she
might
get
into
a
controversy
with
him
but
in
the
end
she
stated
that
she
expected
to
find
our
little
mystery
simply
a
novel
variation
on
what
was
so
familiar
to
her
as
might
be
supposed
general
hume
had
no
opinion
he
merely
expressed
himself
as
being
prepared
to
accept
any
sound
theory
or
portions
of
such
theories
as
might
be
advanced
and
arrive
at
a
workable
conclusion
therefrom
which
was
exactly
what
we
wanted
of
him
of
them
all
professor
herold
showed
the
most
enthusiasm
perhaps
this
was
because
despite
his
attainments
he
is
still
young
at
any
rate
he
made
it
clear
that
he
was
fully
prepared
to
learn
something
entirely
new
in
science
and
he
was
almost
eager
to
adjust
his
previous
notions
and
facts
to
the
new
discoveries
when
all
these
various
viewpoints
had
been
cleared
up
and
we
felt
that
we
understood
each
other
it
was
inevitable
that
we
should
look
to
sir
henry
to
state
his
position
this
one
man
combined
a
large
amount
of
the
various
specialised
abilities
for
which
the
others
were
noted
and
they
all
knew
and
respected
him
accordingly
had
he
stood
and
theorised
half
the
afternoon
they
would
willingly
have
sat
and
listened
but
instead
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
observed
to
me
the
most
important
development
of
all
was
hearing
the
sound
of
a
dog
bark
coming
from
the
ring
as
i
recall
the
details
the
sound
was
emitted
just
after
the
gem
had
been
submitted
to
considerable
handling
from
miss
fenton
fingers
to
her
brother
and
back
again
in
other
words
it
was
subjected
to
a
mixture
of
opposing
animal
magnetisms
suppose
we
experiment
further
with
it
charlotte
slipped
the
gem
from
her
finger
and
passed
it
around
each
of
us
held
it
for
a
second
or
two
after
which
charlotte
clasped
the
ring
tightly
in
her
palm
while
we
all
joined
hands
it
was
as
i
have
said
broad
daylight
the
hour
shortly
after
one
scarcely
had
our
hands
completed
the
circuit
than
something
happened
from
out
of
charlotte
closed
hand
there
issued
an
entirely
new
sound
at
first
it
was
so
faint
and
fragmentary
that
only
two
of
us
heard
it
then
it
became
stronger
and
more
continuous
and
presently
we
were
all
gazing
at
each
other
in
wonderment
for
the
sound
was
that
of
footsteps
xxvi
direct
from
paradise
the
sound
was
not
like
that
of
the
walking
of
the
human
nor
was
it
such
as
an
animal
would
make
it
was
neither
a
thud
nor
a
pattering
but
more
like
a
scratching
shuffle
such
as
reminded
me
of
nothing
that
i
had
ever
heard
before
next
moment
however
there
came
another
sort
of
sound
plainly
audible
above
the
footsteps
this
was
a
thin
musical
chuckle
which
ended
in
a
deep
but
faint
throb
it
happened
only
once
immediately
it
was
followed
by
a
steady
clicking
such
as
might
be
made
by
gently
striking
a
stick
against
the
pavement
only
sharper
this
lasted
a
minute
during
which
the
other
sounds
ceased
once
more
the
footsteps
they
were
not
very
loud
but
in
the
stillness
of
that
room
they
all
but
resounded
presently
charlotte
could
stand
it
no
longer
she
placed
the
ring
on
the
table
where
it
continued
to
emit
those
unplaceable
sounds
well
do
do
you
people
stammered
malloy
do
you
people
all
hear
that
miss
clarke
face
was
rather
pale
but
her
mouth
was
firm
it
is
nothing
said
she
with
theosophical
positiveness
you
must
not
believe
it
it
is
not
the
truth
of
pardon
me
interrupted
sir
henry
but
this
is
something
to
argue
about
it
is
a
reality
and
the
sooner
we
all
admit
it
the
better
there
is
a
living
creature
of
some
kind
making
that
sound
it
is
the
spirit
of
some
creature
asserted
mme
le
fabre
plainly
at
her
ease
she
was
on
familiar
ground
now
if
only
we
had
a
medium
abruptly
the
sounds
left
the
vicinity
of
the
ring
at
first
we
could
not
locate
their
new
position
then
herold
declared
that
they
came
from
under
the
table
and
presently
we
were
all
gathered
on
the
floor
listening
to
those
odd
little
sounds
while
the
ring
remained
thirty
inches
above
on
the
top
of
the
table
it
may
be
that
the
thing
whatever
it
was
did
not
care
for
such
a
crowd
for
shortly
the
shuffling
ceased
and
for
a
while
we
stared
and
listened
scarcely
breathing
trying
to
locate
the
new
position
finally
we
went
back
to
our
chairs
we
had
heard
nothing
further
nevertheless
we
continued
to
keep
silence
with
our
ears
alert
for
anything
more
hush
whispered
charlotte
all
of
a
sudden
did
you
hear
that
and
she
looked
up
toward
the
ceiling
in
a
moment
i
caught
the
sound
it
was
exceedingly
faint
like
the
distant
thrumming
of
a
zither
only
it
was
a
single
note
which
did
not
rise
and
fall
although
there
seemed
a
continual
variation
in
its
volume
unexpectedly
the
other
sounds
came
again
down
under
the
table
this
time
we
remained
in
our
seats
and
simply
listened
and
presently
sir
henry
referring
to
the
ring
made
this
suggestion
suppose
we
seal
it
up
and
see
whether
it
inducts
the
sound
then
as
well
as
when
this
appealed
to
herold
very
strongly
the
others
were
agreeable
so
i
ran
upstairs
to
my
room
and
secured
a
small
metal
canister
which
i
knew
to
be
airtight
it
was
necessary
to
remove
the
stone
from
the
ring
in
order
to
get
it
into
the
opening
in
the
can
presently
this
was
done
and
while
our
invisible
visitor
continued
his
scratchy
little
walking
as
before
i
screwed
the
top
of
the
can
down
as
tightly
as
i
could
instantly
the
footsteps
halted
i
unscrewed
the
top
a
trifle
as
instantly
the
stepping
was
resumed
ah
cried
herold
it
a
question
of
radioactivity
then
remember
le
bon
experiments
sir
henry
but
miss
clarke
was
sorely
mystified
by
this
simple
matter
and
herself
repeated
the
experiments
equally
puzzled
was
mme
le
fabre
according
to
her
theory
a
spirit
would
mind
a
little
thing
like
a
metal
box
of
them
all
malloy
was
the
least
disturbed
so
decidedly
so
that
general
hume
eyed
him
quizzically
fine
bunch
of
hallucinations
almost
commonplace
retorted
malloy
presently
i
mentioned
that
the
rhamda
had
come
from
the
basement
on
the
night
that
ariadne
had
materialised
and
i
showed
that
the
only
possible
route
into
the
cellar
was
through
the
locked
door
in
the
breakfast
room
since
the
windows
were
all
too
small
and
there
was
no
other
door
query
how
had
the
rhamda
got
there
immediately
they
all
became
alert
as
herold
said
one
thing
or
the
other
is
true
either
there
is
something
downstairs
which
has
escaped
you
fenton
or
else
avec
is
able
to
materialise
in
any
place
he
chooses
let
look
we
all
went
down
except
charlotte
who
went
upstairs
to
stay
with
ariadne
by
turns
each
of
us
held
the
ring
and
as
we
unlocked
the
basement
door
we
noted
that
the
invisible
walking
creature
had
reached
there
before
us
down
the
steps
went
those
unseen
little
feet
jumping
from
one
step
to
the
next
just
ahead
of
us
all
the
way
when
within
three
or
four
steps
of
the
bottom
the
creature
made
one
leap
do
for
them
all
i
had
previously
run
an
extension
cord
down
into
the
basement
and
both
compartments
could
now
be
lighted
by
powerful
electric
lamps
we
gave
the
place
a
quick
examination
what
all
this
newly
turned
earth
mean
inquired
sir
henry
pointing
to
the
result
of
jerome
efforts
a
few
months
before
and
i
explained
how
he
and
harry
on
the
chance
the
basement
might
contain
some
clue
as
to
the
localisation
of
the
blind
spot
had
dug
without
result
in
the
bluish
clay
sir
henry
picked
up
the
spade
which
had
never
been
moved
from
where
jerome
had
dropped
it
and
while
i
went
on
to
tell
about
the
pool
of
liquids
which
for
some
unknown
reason
had
not
seeped
into
the
soil
since
forming
there
the
englishman
proceeded
to
dig
vigorously
into
the
heap
i
had
mentioned
the
rest
of
us
watched
him
thoughtfully
we
remembered
that
digging
had
been
done
after
queen
disappearance
and
the
dog
had
vanished
in
the
rear
room
the
one
in
which
chick
and
holcomb
had
last
been
seen
now
when
jerome
had
dug
the
clay
from
the
basement
under
this
the
he
had
thrown
it
through
the
once
concealed
opening
in
the
partition
had
thrown
the
clay
that
is
in
a
small
heap
under
the
library
and
after
jerome
had
done
this
the
phenomena
had
occurred
in
the
library
not
in
the
by
jove
ejaculated
general
hume
as
i
pointed
this
out
this
may
be
something
more
you
know
that
mere
coincidence
sir
henry
said
nothing
but
continued
his
spading
he
paid
attention
to
nothing
save
the
heap
that
jerome
had
formed
and
with
each
spadeful
he
bent
over
and
examined
the
clay
very
carefully
miss
clarke
and
mme
le
fabre
both
remained
very
calm
about
it
all
each
from
her
own
viewpoint
regarded
the
work
as
more
or
less
a
waste
of
time
but
i
noticed
that
they
did
not
take
their
eyes
from
the
spade
sir
henry
stopped
to
rest
let
me
offered
herold
and
went
on
as
the
englishman
had
done
holding
up
each
spadeful
for
inspection
and
it
was
thus
that
we
made
a
strange
discovery
we
all
saw
it
at
the
same
time
embedded
in
the
bluish
earth
was
a
small
piece
of
stone
and
protruding
from
its
upper
surface
was
a
tiny
pebble
no
bigger
than
a
shot
herold
thrust
the
point
of
his
spade
under
the
stone
to
lift
it
up
whereupon
he
gave
a
queer
exclamation
well
that
funny
holding
the
stone
up
in
front
of
us
that
little
thing
as
heavy
as
as
it
heavier
than
lead
sir
henry
picked
the
stone
off
the
spade
immediately
the
material
crumbled
in
his
hands
as
though
rotting
so
that
it
left
only
the
small
red
pebble
intact
sir
henry
weighed
this
thoughtfully
in
his
palm
then
without
a
word
handed
it
around
we
all
wondered
at
the
pebble
it
was
most
astonishingly
heavy
as
i
say
it
was
no
bigger
than
a
shot
yet
it
was
vastly
heavier
afterward
we
weighed
it
upstairs
and
found
that
the
trifle
weighed
over
half
a
pound
considering
its
very
small
bulk
this
worked
out
to
be
a
specific
gravity
of
or
almost
ten
times
as
heavy
as
the
same
bulk
of
pure
gold
and
gold
is
heavy
inevitably
we
saw
that
there
must
be
some
connection
between
this
unprecedentedly
heavy
speck
of
material
and
that
gem
of
mystery
for
the
time
being
we
were
careful
to
keep
the
two
apart
as
for
the
unexplained
footsteps
they
were
still
slightly
audible
as
the
invisible
creatures
moved
around
the
cellar
at
last
we
turned
to
go
i
let
the
others
lead
the
way
thus
i
was
the
last
to
approach
the
steps
and
it
was
at
that
moment
that
i
felt
something
brush
against
my
foot
i
stooped
down
my
hands
collided
with
the
thing
that
had
touched
me
and
i
found
myself
clutching
something
invisible
something
which
in
that
brilliant
light
showed
absolutely
nothing
to
my
eyes
but
my
hands
told
me
i
was
grasping
a
very
real
thing
as
real
as
my
fingers
themselves
i
made
some
sort
of
incoherent
exclamation
the
others
turned
and
peered
at
me
what
is
it
came
herold
excited
voice
i
do
know
i
gasped
come
but
sir
henry
was
the
first
to
reach
me
next
instant
he
too
was
fingering
the
tiny
unseen
object
and
such
was
his
iron
nerve
and
superior
he
identified
it
almost
at
once
by
the
lord
softly
why
it
a
small
bird
come
another
second
and
they
were
all
there
i
was
glad
enough
of
it
for
like
a
flash
with
an
unexpectedness
that
startles
me
even
now
as
i
think
of
it
the
thing
became
visible
right
in
my
grasp
a
little
fluttering
bird
came
to
life
xxvii
solved
it
was
a
tiny
thing
and
most
amazingly
beautiful
it
could
not
have
stood
as
high
as
a
canary
and
had
its
feathers
been
made
of
gleaming
silver
they
could
not
have
been
lovelier
and
its
head
and
long
tail
were
such
as
no
man
on
earth
ever
set
eyes
on
like
a
flash
it
was
gone
not
more
than
a
half
a
second
was
this
enchanting
apparition
visible
to
us
before
we
could
discern
any
more
than
i
have
mentioned
it
not
only
vanished
but
it
ceased
to
make
any
sounds
whatever
and
each
of
us
drew
a
long
breath
as
one
might
after
being
given
a
glimpse
of
an
angel
right
now
five
or
six
hours
after
the
events
i
have
just
described
it
is
very
easy
for
me
to
smile
at
my
emotions
of
the
time
how
startled
and
mystified
i
was
and
why
not
confess
it
just
a
trifle
afraid
why
because
i
did
understand
merely
that
at
this
moment
i
sit
in
my
laboratory
upstairs
in
that
house
rejoicing
in
having
reached
the
end
of
the
mystery
for
the
enigma
of
the
blind
spot
is
no
more
i
have
solved
it
now
twenty
feet
away
in
another
room
lies
ariadne
already
there
is
a
faint
trace
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
her
heart
is
beating
more
strongly
another
hour
says
higgins
and
she
will
be
restored
to
us
the
time
is
seven
i
did
sleep
at
all
last
night
i
have
slept
since
for
the
past
five
hours
we
have
been
working
steadily
on
the
mystery
ever
since
our
finding
that
little
red
pebble
in
the
basement
the
last
three
hours
of
the
time
i
have
been
treating
ariadne
using
means
which
our
discoveries
indicated
and
in
order
to
keep
awake
i
have
been
dictating
this
account
to
a
stenographer
this
young
lady
a
miss
dibble
is
downstairs
where
her
typewriter
will
not
bother
yes
put
that
down
too
miss
dibble
i
want
people
to
know
everything
she
has
a
telephone
clamped
to
her
ears
and
i
am
talking
into
a
microphone
which
is
fixed
to
a
stand
on
my
desk
on
that
desk
are
four
switches
all
are
of
the
type
and
from
them
run
several
wires
some
going
to
one
end
of
the
room
where
they
are
attached
to
the
holcomb
gem
others
running
to
the
opposite
end
making
contact
with
the
tiny
heavy
stone
we
found
in
the
basement
other
wires
run
from
the
switches
to
lead
bands
around
my
wrists
also
between
switches
are
several
connections
one
circuit
containing
an
amplifying
apparatus
by
throwing
these
switches
in
various
combinations
i
can
secure
any
given
alteration
of
forces
and
direct
them
where
i
choose
for
there
are
two
other
wires
these
run
from
my
own
lead
bracelets
to
another
room
a
pair
clamped
around
the
wrists
of
ariadne
for
i
hobart
fenton
am
now
a
living
human
transforming
station
i
am
converting
the
power
of
the
infinite
into
the
energy
of
life
and
i
am
transmitting
that
power
directly
out
of
the
ether
as
conduced
through
these
two
marvellous
stones
back
into
the
nervous
system
of
the
girl
i
love
another
hour
and
she
will
exist
it
was
all
so
very
simple
now
that
i
understand
it
and
yet
well
an
absolutely
new
thing
is
always
very
hard
to
put
into
words
to
begin
with
i
must
acknowledge
the
enormous
help
which
i
have
had
from
my
friends
miss
clarke
mme
le
fabre
general
hume
malloy
and
herold
these
people
are
still
in
the
house
with
me
i
think
they
are
eating
supper
i
already
had
mine
really
i
ca
take
much
credit
to
myself
for
what
i
have
found
out
the
others
supplied
most
of
the
facts
i
merely
happened
to
fit
them
together
and
because
of
my
relationship
to
the
problem
am
now
doing
the
heroic
end
of
the
work
as
for
harry
he
and
holcomb
chick
watson
and
even
the
dog
i
shall
have
them
out
of
the
blind
spot
inside
of
twelve
hours
all
i
need
is
a
little
rest
i
go
straight
to
bed
as
soon
as
i
finish
reviving
ariadne
and
when
i
wake
up
we
see
who
who
friend
rhamda
i
too
exuberant
to
hold
myself
down
to
the
job
of
telling
what
discovered
but
it
got
to
be
done
here
goes
i
practically
took
my
life
in
my
hands
when
i
first
made
connection
however
i
observed
the
precaution
of
rigging
up
a
primary
connection
direct
from
the
ring
to
the
pebble
running
the
wire
along
the
floor
some
distance
away
from
where
i
sat
no
ill
effects
when
i
ventured
into
the
line
of
force
so
i
began
to
experiment
with
the
switches
that
precautionary
circuit
was
herold
idea
his
also
the
amplifying
apparatus
the
mental
attitude
was
miss
clarke
modified
by
malloy
the
lead
bracelets
were
mme
le
fabre
suggestion
they
work
fine
sir
henry
was
the
one
who
pointed
out
the
advantage
of
the
microphone
i
am
using
if
my
hands
become
paralysed
i
can
easily
call
for
help
to
my
side
well
the
first
connection
i
tried
resulted
in
nothing
perfectly
blank
then
i
tried
another
and
another
meanwhile
continually
adjusting
the
amplifier
and
as
a
result
i
am
now
able
at
will
to
do
either
or
all
of
the
following
i
can
induct
sounds
from
the
blind
spot
i
can
induct
light
or
visibility
or
any
given
object
or
person
in
toto
and
now
to
tell
how
no
i
just
sleepy
not
weak
let
see
where
was
i
oh
yes
those
connections
they
got
to
be
done
just
right
with
the
proper
tension
in
the
coils
and
the
correct
mental
attitude
to
harmonise
i
wish
i
was
so
tired
one
moment
no
no
i
all
right
i
queer
by
jove
that
a
funny
thing
just
now
i
must
have
got
an
inducted
current
from
another
wire
mixed
with
these
and
i
got
a
glimpse
into
the
blind
spot
a
great
no
it
a
what
a
terrific
crowd
wonder
what
they
all
by
jove
it
good
lord
it
he
and
chick
no
i
not
wandering
having
the
experience
of
my
life
now
that
the
boy
do
let
bluff
you
good
good
tell
where
to
head
in
that
the
boy
rub
it
in
i
do
know
what
you
up
to
but
i
with
you
er
there
a
big
crowd
of
ugly
looking
chaps
there
and
i
ca
make
it
out
just
a
moment
a
moment
what
does
it
mean
anyway
just
i
danger
by
heaven
that
what
it
means
no
i
all
right
the
thing
came
to
an
end
abruptly
that
all
everything
normal
again
the
room
just
the
same
as
it
was
a
moment
ago
hello
i
seem
to
have
started
something
the
wire
down
on
the
floor
has
commenced
to
hum
oh
i
got
my
eye
on
it
and
if
anything
miss
dibble
tell
herold
to
come
on
the
run
quick
did
you
good
do
stop
writing
i
there
chick
chick
how
did
you
get
here
what
you
ca
see
me
why
chick
listen
listen
man
i
gone
into
the
blind
spot
write
this
down
the
connection
that
herold
herold
this
is
chick
watson
listen
now
you
two
the
the
i
can
hardly
it
from
no
to
to
to
the
ring
then
coil
both
switches
chick
ah
i
note
by
miss
l
just
as
fenton
made
the
concluding
remark
as
above
there
came
a
loud
crash
followed
by
the
voice
of
herold
then
there
came
a
very
loud
clang
from
a
bell
just
one
stroke
after
which
i
caught
fenton
voice
herold
chick
can
tell
you
what
it
wants
us
to
do
and
with
that
his
voice
trailed
off
into
nothing
and
died
away
as
for
fenton
himself
i
am
informed
that
he
has
utterly
disappeared
and
in
his
stead
there
now
exists
a
man
who
is
known
to
hansen
as
chick
watson
xxviii
the
man
from
space
before
starting
the
conclusion
of
the
blind
spot
mystery
it
may
be
just
as
well
for
the
two
publicists
who
are
bringing
it
to
the
press
to
follow
hobart
fenton
example
and
go
into
a
bit
of
explanation
the
two
men
who
wrote
the
first
two
parts
were
participants
and
necessarily
writing
almost
in
the
present
tense
while
they
could
give
an
accurate
and
vivid
account
of
their
feelings
and
experiences
they
could
only
guess
at
what
lay
in
the
future
at
the
events
that
would
unravel
it
all
but
the
present
writers
have
the
advantage
of
working
of
seeing
of
weighing
in
the
retrospect
they
know
just
where
they
are
going
the
coming
of
chick
watson
brought
new
perspective
hitherto
we
had
been
looking
into
the
darkness
whatever
had
been
caught
in
the
focus
of
the
spot
had
become
lost
to
our
five
senses
yet
facts
are
facts
it
was
no
mere
trickery
that
had
caught
holcomb
in
the
beginning
one
by
one
men
of
the
highest
standards
and
character
had
been
either
victims
or
witness
to
its
reality
and
power
so
the
coming
of
watson
may
well
be
set
down
as
one
of
the
deciding
moments
of
history
he
who
had
been
the
victim
a
year
before
was
returning
through
the
very
spot
that
had
engulfed
him
he
was
the
herald
of
the
great
unknown
an
ambassador
of
the
infinite
itself
it
will
be
remembered
that
of
all
the
inmates
of
the
house
hansen
was
the
only
one
who
had
a
personal
acquaintance
with
watson
one
year
before
the
doctor
had
seen
him
a
shadow
wasted
worn
exhausted
he
had
talked
with
him
on
that
memorable
night
in
the
cafe
well
he
remembered
the
incident
and
the
subject
of
that
strange
conversation
the
secret
of
life
that
had
been
discovered
by
the
missing
holcomb
and
hansen
had
pondered
it
often
since
what
was
the
force
that
was
pulsing
through
the
blind
spot
it
had
reached
out
on
the
earth
and
had
plucked
up
youth
as
well
as
wisdom
this
was
the
first
time
it
had
ever
given
up
that
which
it
had
taken
it
was
watson
sure
enough
but
it
was
not
the
man
he
had
known
one
year
before
except
for
the
basic
features
hansen
would
not
have
recognized
him
the
shadow
was
gone
the
pallor
the
touch
of
death
he
was
hale
and
radiant
his
skin
had
the
pink
glow
of
alert
fitness
except
for
being
dazed
he
appeared
perfectly
natural
in
the
tense
moment
of
his
arrival
the
little
group
waited
in
silence
what
had
he
to
tell
them
but
he
did
not
see
them
at
first
he
groped
about
blindly
moving
slowly
and
holding
his
hands
before
him
his
face
was
calm
and
settled
its
lines
told
decision
there
was
not
a
question
in
any
mind
present
but
that
the
man
had
come
for
a
purpose
why
could
he
not
see
perhaps
the
light
was
too
dim
some
one
thought
to
turn
on
the
extra
lights
it
brought
the
first
word
from
watson
he
threw
up
both
arms
before
his
face
like
one
shutting
out
the
lightning
do
he
begged
do
shut
off
the
lights
you
will
blind
me
please
please
darken
the
room
sir
henry
sprang
to
the
switch
instantly
the
place
went
to
shadow
there
was
just
enough
light
from
the
moon
to
distinguish
the
several
forms
grouped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
hansen
proffered
a
chair
thank
you
ah
hansen
you
are
here
i
had
thought
this
is
much
better
i
can
see
fairly
well
now
you
came
very
near
to
blinding
me
permanently
you
did
know
it
the
then
and
yet
of
course
it
the
moon
the
moon
he
stopped
there
was
a
strange
wistfulness
in
the
last
word
and
suddenly
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
turned
in
gladness
as
though
to
drink
in
the
mellow
flow
of
the
radiance
the
moon
gentlemen
doctor
who
are
these
people
this
is
the
house
of
the
blind
spot
and
it
is
the
moon
the
good
old
earth
and
san
francisco
he
stopped
again
there
was
a
bit
of
indecision
and
of
wonder
mixed
with
his
gladness
the
stillness
was
only
broken
by
the
scarcely
audible
voice
of
mme
le
fabre
now
we
know
it
is
proven
the
sceptics
have
always
asked
why
the
spirits
work
only
in
the
half
light
we
know
watson
looked
to
hansen
who
is
this
lady
who
are
these
others
can
you
see
them
perfectly
it
is
the
lady
in
the
corner
she
thinks
that
you
are
a
spirit
watson
laughed
i
a
spirit
try
me
and
see
certainly
asserted
mme
le
fabre
you
are
out
of
the
blind
spot
i
know
it
will
prove
everything
ah
yes
the
watson
hesitated
again
the
indecision
there
was
something
latent
that
he
could
not
recall
though
conscious
part
of
his
mind
was
still
in
the
apparent
fog
that
lingers
back
into
slumber
i
do
understand
he
spoke
who
are
you
it
was
sir
henry
this
time
mr
watson
we
are
a
sort
of
committee
this
is
the
house
at
chatterton
place
we
are
after
the
great
secret
that
was
discovered
by
holcomb
we
were
summoned
by
hobart
consciousness
is
an
enigma
hitherto
watson
had
been
almost
inert
his
actions
and
manner
of
speech
had
been
mechanical
that
it
was
the
natural
result
of
the
strange
force
that
had
thrown
him
out
no
one
doubted
the
mention
of
hobart
fenton
jerked
him
into
the
full
vigour
of
thinking
he
straightened
himself
hobart
hobart
fenton
where
is
he
that
we
do
not
know
answered
sir
henry
he
was
here
a
moment
ago
it
is
almost
too
impossible
for
belief
perhaps
you
can
tell
you
mean
exactly
into
the
blind
spot
one
and
the
other
your
coming
was
coincident
with
his
going
chick
raised
up
even
in
that
faint
light
they
could
appreciate
the
full
vigour
of
his
splendid
form
he
was
even
more
of
an
athlete
than
in
his
college
days
before
the
blind
spot
took
him
and
when
he
realised
what
sir
henry
had
said
he
held
up
one
magnificent
arm
almost
in
the
manner
of
benediction
hobart
has
gone
through
thank
heaven
for
that
it
was
a
puzzle
true
in
that
little
group
there
was
represented
the
accumulated
wisdom
of
human
effort
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
general
there
was
not
a
sceptic
among
them
they
were
ready
to
explain
almost
anything
but
this
in
the
natural
weakness
of
futility
they
had
come
to
associate
the
aspect
of
death
or
terror
with
the
blind
spot
yet
here
was
watson
watson
alive
and
strong
he
was
the
reverse
of
what
they
had
subconsciously
expected
what
is
this
blind
spot
inquired
sir
henry
evenly
and
what
do
you
mean
by
giving
thanks
that
fenton
has
gone
into
it
not
now
not
one
word
of
explanation
until
what
time
is
it
watson
broke
off
to
demand
they
told
him
he
began
to
talk
rapidly
with
amazing
force
and
decision
and
in
a
manner
whose
sincerity
left
no
chance
for
doubt
then
we
have
five
hours
not
one
second
to
lose
do
what
i
say
and
answer
my
questions
then
we
must
not
fail
one
slip
and
the
whole
world
will
be
engulfed
in
the
unknown
turn
on
the
there
was
that
in
the
personality
and
the
vehemence
of
the
man
that
precluded
opposition
out
of
the
blind
spot
had
come
a
dynamic
quality
along
with
the
man
a
quickening
influence
that
made
watson
swift
sure
and
positive
somehow
they
knew
it
was
a
moment
of
destiny
watson
went
on
first
did
hobart
fenton
open
the
spot
or
was
it
a
period
by
i
mean
did
it
open
by
chance
as
it
did
when
it
caught
harry
and
me
just
what
did
hobart
do
tell
me
it
was
a
singular
question
how
could
they
answer
it
however
malloy
related
as
much
as
he
knew
of
what
hobart
had
done
his
wires
and
apparatus
were
now
merely
a
tangled
mass
of
fused
metals
nothing
remained
intact
but
the
blue
gem
and
the
red
pebble
i
see
and
this
pebble
you
found
it
by
digging
in
the
cellar
i
how
did
he
know
that
hansen
brought
that
curiously
heavy
little
stone
and
laid
it
in
watson
hand
the
newcomer
touched
it
with
his
finger
and
for
a
brief
moment
he
studied
it
then
he
looked
up
it
the
small
one
he
stated
and
you
found
it
in
the
cellar
it
was
very
fortunate
the
opening
of
the
spot
was
perhaps
a
little
more
than
half
chance
but
it
was
wonderfully
lucky
it
let
me
out
and
with
the
help
of
god
and
our
own
courage
we
may
open
it
again
long
enough
to
rescue
hobart
harry
and
holcomb
then
we
must
break
the
chain
we
must
destroy
the
revelation
we
must
close
the
spot
forever
small
wonder
that
they
could
understand
what
he
meant
hansen
thought
to
cut
in
with
a
practical
question
my
dear
chick
what
inside
the
spot
we
want
to
know
but
it
was
not
watson
who
answered
it
was
mme
le
fabre
spirits
of
watson
gave
a
sudden
laugh
this
time
he
answered
my
dear
lady
if
you
know
what
i
know
and
what
holcomb
has
discovered
you
would
ask
yourself
a
question
or
so
possibly
you
yourself
are
a
spirit
what
she
gasped
i
a
spirit
exactly
but
there
is
no
time
for
questions
afterwards
not
now
five
hours
and
we
must
someone
came
to
the
door
it
was
jerome
at
the
sight
of
watson
he
stopped
clutching
the
stub
of
his
cigar
between
his
teeth
his
grey
eyes
took
in
the
other
form
from
head
to
shoe
leather
back
he
inquired
what
did
you
find
out
watson
they
must
have
fed
you
well
over
yonder
and
jerome
pointed
toward
the
ceiling
with
his
thumb
it
was
in
his
dour
nature
to
give
way
to
enthusiasm
this
was
merely
his
manner
of
welcome
watson
smiled
the
eats
were
all
right
jerome
but
not
all
the
company
you
just
the
man
i
want
we
have
little
time
none
to
spare
for
talk
are
you
in
touch
with
bertha
holcomb
the
detective
nodded
watson
took
the
chair
that
fenton
had
so
strangely
vacated
and
reached
for
paper
and
pencil
once
or
twice
he
stopped
to
draw
a
line
but
mostly
he
was
calculating
he
referred
constantly
to
a
paper
he
took
from
his
pocket
when
he
was
through
he
spread
his
palm
over
what
he
had
written
jerome
you
are
no
longer
connected
with
headquarters
i
presume
but
can
you
get
men
if
need
you
will
need
them
just
then
watson
noticed
the
uniform
of
general
hume
jerome
can
you
give
this
officer
a
bodyguard
it
was
both
unusual
and
nevertheless
there
was
something
in
watson
manner
that
called
for
no
challenge
something
that
would
have
brooked
no
refusal
and
the
general
although
a
sceptic
was
acting
solely
from
force
of
habit
when
he
objected
it
seems
to
me
watson
that
you
those
who
were
present
are
not
likely
to
forget
it
some
men
are
born
some
rise
to
the
occasion
but
watson
was
both
he
was
dominant
inexorable
he
levelled
his
pencil
at
the
general
it
seems
to
you
general
let
me
ask
you
if
your
country
safety
were
at
stake
would
you
hesitate
to
throw
reinforcements
into
the
breach
all
right
it
settled
take
care
of
your
red
tape
he
wheeled
to
the
detective
jerome
this
is
a
sketch
of
the
compartments
of
holcomb
safe
not
the
large
one
in
his
house
but
the
small
one
in
his
laboratory
go
straight
to
dwight
way
give
this
note
indicating
another
paper
to
bertha
holcomb
tell
her
that
her
father
is
safe
and
that
i
am
out
of
the
blind
spot
tell
her
you
have
come
to
open
the
laboratory
safe
i
written
down
the
combination
if
it
does
work
use
explosives
there
nothing
inside
which
force
can
harm
in
the
compartment
marked
you
will
find
a
small
particle
about
the
size
of
a
pea
wrapped
in
and
locked
in
a
small
metal
box
you
will
have
to
break
the
box
as
for
the
contents
once
you
see
the
stone
you
ca
mistake
it
it
will
weigh
about
six
pounds
get
it
and
guard
it
with
your
life
all
jerome
put
watson
instructions
in
his
wallet
at
the
same
time
glancing
about
the
room
where
is
fenton
he
asked
it
was
watson
who
answered
he
gave
us
the
first
news
that
had
ever
come
from
the
blind
spot
he
spoke
with
firm
deliberation
as
though
in
full
realisation
of
the
sensation
hobart
fenton
has
gone
through
the
blind
spot
just
now
he
is
right
here
in
this
sir
henry
jumped
in
this
room
is
that
what
you
said
watson
the
other
ignored
him
jerome
you
have
a
minute
to
lose
you
and
the
general
bring
that
stone
back
to
this
house
at
any
cost
hurry
in
another
moment
jerome
and
hume
were
gone
and
few
people
that
day
suspected
the
purport
of
that
body
of
silent
men
who
crossed
over
the
bay
of
san
francisco
they
were
grim
and
trusted
and
under
secret
orders
they
had
a
mission
did
they
but
know
it
as
important
as
any
in
history
but
they
knew
only
that
they
were
to
guard
jerome
and
the
general
at
all
hazards
one
peculiarly
heavy
stone
the
size
of
a
pea
how
are
we
ever
to
calculate
its
value
as
for
the
group
remaining
with
watson
not
one
of
them
ever
dreamed
that
any
danger
might
come
out
of
the
blind
spot
its
manifestations
had
been
local
and
mostly
negative
no
the
main
incentive
of
their
interest
had
been
simply
curiosity
but
apparently
watson
was
above
them
all
he
paid
no
further
attention
to
them
for
a
while
he
bent
at
fenton
desk
and
worked
swiftly
at
length
he
thrust
his
papers
aside
i
want
to
see
that
cellar
he
announced
that
is
the
point
where
you
found
that
red
pebble
down
in
the
basement
sir
henry
gave
the
details
when
he
came
to
mention
the
various
liquids
which
fenton
had
poured
into
the
woodwork
upstairs
watson
examined
the
pool
intently
quite
so
they
would
come
out
here
naturally
sir
henry
could
not
understand
his
perplexity
was
reflected
in
the
faces
of
herold
the
two
physicians
malloy
miss
clarke
and
mme
le
fabre
and
charlotte
spoke
for
them
all
ca
you
explain
watson
the
woodwork
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
cellar
there
was
the
floor
between
just
as
you
see
it
naturally
watson
repeated
it
could
be
no
other
place
it
was
on
its
way
to
the
other
side
but
it
could
go
only
simply
a
matter
of
focus
you
know
i
beg
pardon
you
must
hold
your
curiosity
a
little
he
began
measuring
first
he
located
the
line
across
the
floorjoists
overhead
where
rested
the
partition
separating
the
from
the
parlour
finding
the
middle
of
this
line
he
dropped
an
improvised
to
the
ground
and
from
this
spot
as
centre
using
a
string
about
ten
feet
long
he
described
a
circle
on
the
earth
then
referring
to
his
calculations
he
proceeded
to
locate
several
points
with
small
stakes
pressed
into
the
soil
then
he
checked
them
off
and
nodded
it
even
better
than
the
professor
thought
his
theory
is
all
but
proven
if
jerome
and
hume
can
deliver
the
other
stone
without
accident
we
can
save
those
now
inside
the
then
very
solemnly
but
we
face
a
heavy
task
it
will
be
another
thermopylae
we
must
hold
the
gate
against
an
occult
xerxes
together
with
all
his
the
hosts
of
the
dead
exclaimed
mme
le
fabre
no
the
living
just
give
me
time
madame
and
you
will
see
something
hitherto
undreamed
of
as
for
your
theory
tomorrow
you
may
doubt
whether
you
are
living
or
dead
in

holcomb
has
certainly
proved
the
occult
by
material
means
he
has
done
it
with
a
vengeance
in
so
doing
he
has
left
us
in
doubt
as
to
ourselves
and
unless
he
discovers
the
missing
factor
within
the
next
few
hours
we
are
going
to
be
in
the
anomalous
position
of
knowing
plenty
about
the
next
world
but
nothing
about
he
paused
he
must
have
known
that
their
curiosity
could
not
hold
out
much
longer
he
said
now
just
one
thing
more
friends
and
i
can
tell
you
everything
while
we
are
waiting
for
jerome
and
the
general
to
return
but
first
i
must
see
the
one
who
preceded
me
out
of
the
ariadne
from
charlotte
in
wonder
ariadne
exclaimed
watson
he
was
both
puzzled
and
amazed
did
you
call
her
ariadne
she
is
upstairs
cut
in
higgins
i
must
see
her
a
minute
or
two
later
they
stood
in
the
room
where
the
girl
lay
the
coverlet
was
thrown
back
somewhat
revealing
the
bare
left
arm
and
shoulder
and
the
delicately
beautiful
face
upon
the
pillow
her
golden
hair
was
spread
out
in
riotous
profusion
the
other
hand
was
just
protruding
from
the
coverlet
and
displayed
a
faint
red
mark
showing
where
hobart
bracelet
had
been
fastened
at
the
moment
he
disappeared
charlotte
stepped
over
and
laid
her
hand
against
the
girl
cheek
is
she
wonderful
she
murmured
but
higgins
looked
to
watson
do
you
know
her
the
other
nodded
he
stooped
over
and
listened
to
her
breathing
his
manner
was
that
of
reverence
and
admiration
he
touched
her
hand
i
see
how
it
must
have
happened
precisely
what
i
experienced
only
then
you
call
her
ariadne
we
had
to
call
her
something
replied
charlotte
and
the
name
it
just
came
i
perhaps
anyhow
it
was
a
remarkably
good
guess
her
true
name
is
the
the
aradna
who
what
is
she
just
that
the
aradna
she
is
one
of
the
factors
that
may
save
us
and
on
earth
we
would
call
her
then
without
waiting
for
the
inevitable
question
watson
said
your
professional
judgment
will
soon
come
to
the
supreme
test
higgins
she
is
simply
numbed
and
dazed
from
coming
through
the
charlotte
had
already
described
to
him
the
girl
arrival
the
mystery
is
that
she
was
permitted
an
hour
of
rationality
before
this
came
upon
her
i
wonder
if
hobart
vitality
had
anything
to
do
with
it
half
to
himself
as
for
the
rhamda
he
smiled
he
is
merely
interested
in
the
spot
that
is
all
he
would
never
harm
the
aradna
he
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
her
condition
we
were
mistaken
about
the
man
anyway
it
is
the
spot
of
life
that
interests
us
the
spot
of
life
repeated
sir
henry
is
that
yes
the
blind
spot
as
it
is
known
from
the
other
side
it
overtops
all
your
sciences
embraces
every
cult
and
lies
at
the
base
of
all
truth
it
is
it
is
explain
watson
turned
to
the
head
upon
the
pillow
he
ventured
to
touch
the
cheek
with
a
trace
of
tenderness
in
his
action
and
of
wistfulness
near
to
reverence
it
was
not
love
it
was
rather
as
one
might
touch
a
fairy
in
both
spirit
and
substance
she
was
truly
of
another
world
watson
gave
a
soft
sigh
and
looked
up
at
the
englishman
yes
i
can
explain
now
that
i
know
she
is
well
i
shall
tell
you
all
i
know
from
the
beginning
it
certainly
your
turn
to
ask
questions
i
may
not
be
able
to
tell
you
all
that
you
want
to
know
but
at
least
i
know
more
than
any
other
person
this
side
of
the
spot
let
us
go
down
to
the
he
glanced
at
a
clock
we
have
nearly
five
hours
remaining
our
test
will
come
when
we
open
the
spot
we
must
not
only
open
it
but
we
must
close
it
at
all
they
had
reached
the
lower
hall
at
the
front
door
watson
paused
and
turned
to
the
others
just
a
moment
we
may
fail
tonight
in
case
we
do
i
would
like
one
last
look
at
my
own
world
at
san
he
opened
the
door
the
rest
hung
back
though
they
could
not
understand
they
could
sense
vaguely
the
emotion
of
this
strange
man
of
brave
adventure
the
scene
the
setting
the
beauty
were
all
akin
to
the
moment
watson
stood
bareheaded
looking
down
at
the
blinking
lights
of
the
city
of
the
argonauts
the
moon
in
a
starlit
sky
was
drifting
through
a
ragged
lace
of
cloud
and
over
it
all
was
a
momentary
hush
as
though
the
man
emotion
had
called
for
it
no
one
spoke
at
last
watson
closed
the
door
and
there
was
just
the
trace
of
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
now
my
friends
and
led
the
way
into
the
parlour
xxix
the
occult
world
in
telling
what
i
know
began
watson
i
shall
use
a
bit
of
a
preface
it
necessary
in
a
way
if
you
are
to
understand
me
besides
it
will
give
you
the
advantage
of
looking
into
the
blind
spot
with
the
clear
eyes
of
reason
i
intend
to
tell
all
to
omit
nothing
my
purpose
in
doing
this
is
that
in
case
we
should
fail
tonight
you
will
be
able
to
give
my
account
to
the
it
was
a
strange
introduction
his
listeners
exchanged
thoughtful
glances
but
they
all
affirmed
and
sir
henry
hitched
his
chair
almost
impatiently
all
right
watson
please
to
begin
with
said
watson
i
assume
that
you
all
know
of
holcomb
announcement
concerning
the
blind
spot
you
remember
that
he
promised
to
solve
the
occult
how
he
foretold
that
he
would
prove
it
not
by
immaterial
but
by
the
very
material
means
that
he
would
produce
the
fact
and
the
substance
now
the
professor
had
promised
to
deliver
something
far
greater
than
he
had
thought
it
to
be
at
the
same
time
what
he
knew
of
the
blind
spot
was
part
conjecture
and
part
fact
like
his
forebears
and
contemporaries
he
looked
upon
man
as
the
real
being
but
it
a
question
now
as
to
which
is
reality
and
which
is
not
there
is
not
a
branch
of
philosophy
that
looks
upon
the
question
in
that
light
bishop
berkeley
came
near
and
he
has
been
followed
by
others
but
they
all
have
been
deceived
by
their
own
sophistry
however
except
for
the
grossest
materialists
all
thinkers
take
cognizance
of
a
hereafter
no
one
dreamed
of
a
blind
spot
and
what
it
may
lead
to
what
it
might
contain
we
are
we
interpret
the
universe
by
the
measure
of
five
yardsticks
yet
the
blind
spot
takes
even
those
away
the
more
we
know
it
seems
the
less
certain
we
are
of
ourselves
as
i
said
to
mme
le
fabre
it
is
a
difficult
question
to
determine
after
all
just
who
are
the
ghosts
at
any
rate
i
know
and
he
paused
for
effect
i
know
that
there
are
uncounted
millions
who
look
upon
us
and
our
workings
as
entirely
supernatural
remember
that
what
i
have
to
tell
you
is
just
as
real
as
your
own
lives
have
been
since
babyhood
it
was
slightly
over
a
year
ago
that
my
last
night
on
the
earth
arrived
i
had
gone
out
for
the
evening
in
the
forlorn
hope
of
meeting
a
friend
of
having
some
slight
taste
of
pleasure
before
the
end
came
for
several
days
i
had
been
labouring
under
a
sort
of
premonition
knowing
that
my
life
was
slowly
seeping
away
and
that
my
vitality
was
slipping
bit
by
bit
to
what
i
thought
must
be
death
had
i
then
known
what
i
know
now
i
could
have
saved
myself
but
if
i
had
done
it
if
i
had
saved
myself
we
would
never
have
found
holcomb
perhaps
it
was
the
same
fate
that
led
me
to
harry
that
night
i
know
nevertheless
if
there
is
any
truth
in
what
i
have
learned
on
the
other
side
of
the
blind
spot
it
would
seem
that
there
is
something
higher
than
mere
fate
i
had
never
believed
in
luck
but
when
everything
works
out
to
a
fraction
of
a
breath
one
ceases
to
be
sceptical
on
the
question
of
destiny
and
chance
say
everything
that
happened
that
night
was
forced
from
the
other
side
in
short
my
giving
that
ring
to
harry
was
simply
a
link
in
the
chain
of
circumstances
it
just
had
to
be
the
prophecy
would
not
have
had
it
without
stopping
to
explain
what
he
meant
by
the
word
prophecy
watson
went
on
that
what
makes
it
puzzling
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
how
every
bit
has
dovetailed
with
such
exactness
we
you
and
i
are
certainly
not
supernatural
and
yet
on
the
other
side
of
the
spot
the
proof
is
overwhelmingly
convincing
i
was
very
weak
that
night
so
weak
that
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
remember
the
last
i
recollect
was
my
going
to
the
back
of
the
house
to
the
kitchen
i
think
i
had
a
light
in
my
hands
the
boys
were
in
the
front
room
waiting
one
of
them
had
opened
a
door
some
yards
away
from
where
i
stood
coming
as
it
did
on
the
instant
it
is
difficult
to
describe
but
i
knew
it
instinctively
for
what
it
was
the
dot
of
blue
on
the
ceiling
and
the
string
of
light
then
a
sensation
of
falling
like
dropping
into
space
itself
it
is
hard
to
describe
the
horrifying
terror
of
plunging
head
on
from
an
immense
height
to
a
plain
at
a
vastly
lower
level
and
that
all
that
i
remember
from
this
footnote
in
justice
to
watson
the
present
writers
have
thought
it
best
at
this
stage
to
transpose
the
story
from
the
first
to
the
third
person
any
narrative
unless
it
is
negative
in
its
material
is
hard
to
give
in
the
first
person
for
where
the
narrator
has
played
an
active
positive
part
he
must
either
curb
himself
or
fall
under
the
slur
of
braggadocio
yet
the
world
wants
the
details
exactly
as
they
happened
hence
the
transposition
editors
watson
opened
his
eyes
the
first
thing
was
light
and
a
sense
of
great
pain
there
was
a
pressure
at
the
back
of
the
eyeballs
a
poignant
sensation
not
unlike
a
that
and
a
sudden
fear
of
madness
of
drivelling
helplessness
the
abrupt
return
of
consciousness
in
such
a
condition
is
not
easy
to
imagine
after
all
he
had
gone
through
this
strange
sequel
must
have
been
terribly
puzzling
to
him
he
was
a
man
of
good
education
well
versed
in
psychology
in
the
first
rush
of
consciousness
he
tried
as
best
he
could
to
weigh
himself
up
in
the
balance
of
aberration
and
it
was
this
very
fact
that
gave
him
his
reassurance
for
it
told
him
that
he
could
think
could
reason
could
count
on
a
mind
in
full
function
but
he
could
not
see
the
pain
in
his
eyeballs
was
blinding
there
was
nothing
he
could
distinguish
everything
was
woven
together
a
mere
blaze
of
wonderful
iridescent
blazing
coloration
but
if
he
could
not
see
he
could
feel
the
pain
was
excruciating
he
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
to
thinking
curiously
enough
that
the
experience
was
similar
to
what
he
had
gone
through
when
upon
learning
to
swim
he
had
first
opened
his
eyes
under
the
water
it
had
been
under
a
blazing
sun
the
pain
and
the
colour
it
was
much
the
same
only
intensified
then
he
knew
that
he
was
very
tired
the
mere
effort
of
that
one
thought
had
cost
him
vitality
he
dropped
back
into
unconsciousness
such
as
was
more
insensibility
than
slumber
he
had
strange
dreams
of
people
walking
of
women
and
of
many
voices
it
was
blurred
and
indistinct
yet
somehow
not
unreal
then
after
an
unguessable
length
of
time
he
awoke
he
was
much
stronger
the
lapse
may
have
been
very
long
he
could
not
know
but
the
pain
in
his
eyes
was
gone
and
he
ventured
to
open
the
lids
again
in
the
face
of
the
light
that
had
been
so
baffling
this
time
he
could
see
not
distinctly
but
still
enough
to
assure
him
of
reality
by
closing
his
eyes
at
intervals
he
was
able
to
rest
them
and
to
accustom
them
gradually
to
the
new
degree
of
light
and
after
a
bit
he
could
see
plainly
he
was
on
a
cot
and
in
a
room
almost
totally
different
from
any
that
he
had
ever
seen
before
the
colour
of
the
walls
even
was
dissimilar
likewise
the
ceiling
it
was
white
in
a
way
and
yet
unlike
it
neither
did
it
resemble
any
of
the
various
tints
to
give
it
a
name
that
he
afterward
learned
alna
implies
but
little
it
was
utterly
new
to
him
apparently
he
was
alone
the
room
was
not
large
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
bedroom
and
after
the
first
novelty
of
the
unplaceable
colour
had
worn
off
he
began
to
take
stock
of
his
own
person
first
he
was
covered
by
the
finest
of
bed
clothing
thick
but
exceedingly
light
there
was
no
counterpane
but
two
blankets
and
two
sheets
and
none
of
them
corresponded
to
any
colour
or
material
he
had
ever
known
he
only
knew
that
their
tints
were
light
rather
than
dark
next
he
moved
his
hands
out
from
under
the
coverings
and
held
them
up
before
his
eyes
he
was
immensely
puzzled
he
naturally
expected
to
see
the
worn
emaciated
hands
which
had
been
his
on
that
dramatic
night
but
the
ones
before
him
were
plump
normal
of
a
healthy
pink
the
wrists
likewise
were
in
perfect
condition
also
his
arms
he
could
not
account
for
this
sudden
return
to
health
of
the
vigour
he
had
known
before
he
began
to
wear
the
ring
he
lay
back
pondering
presently
he
fell
to
examining
his
clothes
there
were
two
garments
made
of
a
textile
rather
heavy
as
to
weight
but
exceedingly
soft
as
to
touch
they
were
slightly
darker
than
the
bed
clothing
in
a
way
they
were
much
like
pyjamas
except
that
both
were
designed
to
be
merely
slipped
into
place
without
buttons
or
that
is
they
were
tailored
to
fit
snugly
over
the
shoulders
and
waist
while
loose
enough
elsewhere
then
he
noticed
the
walls
of
the
room
they
were
after
a
simple
symmetrical
style
coved
to
use
an
architectural
expression
or
curved
where
the
corner
would
come
with
a
radius
much
larger
than
common
amounting
to
four
or
five
feet
so
that
a
person
of
ordinary
height
could
not
stand
close
to
the
wall
without
stooping
where
the
coved
portion
flowed
into
the
perpendicular
of
the
wall
there
was
a
broad
moulding
like
a
plate
rail
which
acted
as
a
support
for
the
hanging
pictures
watson
counted
four
of
these
pictures
instinctively
he
felt
that
they
might
give
him
a
valuable
clue
as
to
his
whereabouts
for
while
his
mind
had
cleared
enough
for
him
to
feel
sure
that
he
had
truly
come
through
the
spot
he
knew
nothing
more
where
was
he
what
would
the
pictures
tell
the
first
was
directly
before
his
eyes
in
size
perhaps
two
by
three
feet
with
its
greater
length
horizontal
it
was
more
of
a
landscape
than
a
portrait
and
watson
eagerness
for
the
subject
itself
made
him
forget
to
note
whether
the
work
was
mechanically
or
manually
executed
for
it
revealed
a
girl
about
ten
or
twelve
very
slightly
draped
enjoying
a
wild
romp
with
a
most
extraordinary
creature
it
was
this
animal
that
made
the
picture
amazing
there
was
no
subtle
significance
in
the
scene
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
technique
the
whole
interest
for
watson
was
in
the
animal
it
was
a
deer
perfect
and
beautiful
but
cast
in
a
lilliputian
mould
it
stood
barely
a
foot
high
the
most
delicate
thing
he
had
ever
looked
upon
mature
in
every
detail
of
its
proportion
the
dainty
hoofs
the
fragile
legs
body
and
small
head
a
miniature
made
such
a
vision
as
might
come
to
the
dreams
of
a
hunter
chick
rose
up
in
bed
in
order
to
examine
it
more
closely
immediately
he
fell
back
again
slightly
dizzy
he
closed
his
eyes
shortly
he
began
examining
the
other
pictures
two
of
these
were
simple
flower
studies
watson
scarcely
knew
which
puzzled
him
most
the
blossoms
or
their
containers
for
the
vases
were
like
loving
cups
broad
as
to
body
and
provided
with
a
handle
on
either
side
their
colours
were
unfamiliar
as
for
the
blossoms
in
one
study
the
blooms
were
a
in
number
and
more
like
shasta
daisies
than
anything
else
but
their
colour
was
totally
unlike
while
they
possessed
wide
striped
stamens
that
gave
the
flowers
an
identity
all
their
own
in
the
other
vase
were
several
varieties
and
every
one
absolutely
unrecognisable
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
was
something
fairly
familiar
at
first
glance
it
seemed
a
simple
basket
of
kittens
done
in
black
and
white
something
like
crayon
and
yet
resembling
sepia
alongside
the
basket
however
was
a
spoon
one
end
resting
on
the
edge
of
a
saucer
and
it
was
the
size
of
the
spoon
that
commanded
chick
attention
rather
the
size
of
the
kittens
any
one
of
which
could
have
curled
up
comfortably
in
the
bowl
of
the
spoon
judging
relatively
if
it
were
an
ordinary
tablespoon
then
the
kittens
were
smaller
than
the
smallest
of
mice
chick
gave
it
up
presently
he
began
speculating
about
the
time
he
decided
that
whatever
the
hour
might
be
it
was
still
daylight
in
one
wall
of
the
room
was
a
large
oval
window
of
a
material
which
may
as
well
be
called
glass
frosted
so
as
to
permit
no
view
of
what
might
lie
outside
but
it
allowed
plenty
of
light
to
enter
cut
in
the
opposite
wall
was
a
doorway
hung
with
a
curtain
instead
of
a
door
this
curtain
was
a
gauzy
material
but
its
maroonlike
shade
completely
hid
all
view
of
whatever
lay
beyond
chick
waited
and
listened
hitherto
he
had
not
heard
a
sound
there
was
not
even
that
subtle
mixed
hum
from
the
distance
that
we
are
accustomed
to
associate
with
silence
he
felt
certain
that
he
was
inside
the
blind
spot
but
as
to
just
where
that
locality
might
lie
he
knew
as
little
as
before
he
knew
only
that
he
in
a
building
of
some
sort
where
and
what
was
the
building
just
then
he
noticed
a
cord
dangling
from
the
ceiling
it
came
down
to
within
six
inches
of
his
head
he
gave
it
a
pull
whereupon
he
heard
a
faint
musical
jangling
in
the
distance
he
tried
to
analyse
the
sound
it
was
not
perhaps
the
word
tinkling
would
serve
better
provisionally
chick
placed
the
key
at
middle
a
moment
later
he
heard
steps
outside
the
curtain
they
were
very
soft
and
light
and
deliberate
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
delicate
white
hand
moved
the
curtain
aside
it
was
a
woman
chick
lay
back
and
wondered
although
not
beautiful
she
was
very
good
to
look
at
with
large
blue
eyes
of
a
deep
tenderness
and
sympathy
even
features
and
a
wonderful
fold
of
rich
brown
hair
held
in
place
by
a
satiny
net
she
started
when
she
saw
chick
wide
open
eyes
then
smiled
a
motherly
smile
and
compassionate
she
was
dressed
in
a
manner
at
once
becoming
and
odd
to
one
unaccustomed
in
a
gown
that
draped
the
entire
figure
yet
left
the
right
arm
and
shoulder
bare
chick
noticed
that
arm
especially
it
was
white
as
marble
moulded
full
and
laced
with
fine
blue
veins
he
had
never
seen
an
arm
like
that
nor
such
a
woman
she
might
have
been
forty
she
came
over
to
the
bed
and
placed
a
hand
on
chick
forehead
again
she
smiled
and
nodded
how
do
you
feel
she
asked
now
this
is
a
strange
thing
watson
could
not
account
for
it
for
although
she
did
not
speak
english
yet
he
could
understand
her
quite
well
at
the
moment
it
seemed
perfectly
obvious
afterward
the
fact
became
amazing
he
answered
in
the
same
way
his
thoughts
directing
his
lips
and
he
found
that
as
long
as
he
made
no
conscious
attempt
to
select
the
words
for
his
thought
he
could
speak
unhesitatingly
where
am
i
she
smiled
indulgently
but
did
not
answer
is
this
the
blind
spot
the
blind
spot
i
do
not
who
are
you
your
nurse
perhaps
soothingly
you
would
like
to
talk
to
the
the
rhamda
yes
the
rhamda
xxx
the
plunge
the
woman
left
him
for
a
while
chick
reflected
upon
what
she
had
said
in
full
rush
of
returning
vigour
his
mind
was
working
clearly
and
with
analytical
exactness
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
a
heaviness
in
the
air
overladen
pregnant
he
became
aware
of
a
strange
undercurrent
of
life
of
an
exceedingly
faint
insistent
sound
and
rhythmical
like
the
breathing
undertones
of
multitudes
he
was
a
city
man
and
accustomed
to
the
murmuring
throbs
of
a
metropolitan
heart
but
this
was
very
different
presently
amid
the
strangeness
he
could
distinguish
the
tinkle
of
elfin
bells
almost
imperceptible
but
musical
the
whole
air
was
laden
with
a
subdued
music
lined
as
it
were
with
a
golden
vibrancy
of
tintinnabulary
cadence
distant
subdued
hardly
more
than
a
whisper
yet
part
of
the
air
itself
it
gave
him
the
feeling
that
he
was
in
a
dream
in
the
realms
of
the
subconscious
he
had
heard
just
such
sounds
exotic
and
unearthly
fleeting
and
evanescent
the
notion
of
dreams
threw
his
mind
into
sudden
alertness
in
an
instant
he
was
thinking
systematically
and
in
the
definite
realisation
of
his
plight
the
woman
had
spoken
of
the
true
she
had
added
a
qualifying
geos
but
that
did
not
matter
whether
geos
or
avec
it
was
still
the
rhamda
by
this
time
watson
was
convinced
that
the
word
indicated
some
sort
of
title
whether
doctor
or
lord
or
professor
was
not
important
what
interested
chick
was
identity
if
he
could
solve
that
he
could
get
at
the
crux
of
the
blind
spot
he
thought
quickly
apparently
it
was
rhamda
avec
who
had
trapped
holcomb
why
what
had
been
the
man
motive
watson
could
not
say
he
only
knew
the
ethics
of
the
deed
was
shaded
with
the
subtleness
of
villainy
that
behind
it
all
was
a
purpose
a
directing
force
and
intelligence
that
was
inexorable
and
irresistible
one
other
thing
he
knew
the
rhamda
avec
came
out
of
the
region
in
which
he
watson
now
found
himself
rather
he
could
have
come
from
nowhere
else
and
watson
could
feel
certain
that
somewhere
somehow
he
would
find
holcomb
in
that
moment
watson
determined
upon
his
future
course
of
action
he
decided
to
state
nothing
intimate
nothing
either
by
word
or
deed
that
might
in
any
manner
incriminate
or
endanger
the
professor
it
was
for
him
to
learn
everything
possible
and
to
do
all
he
could
to
gain
his
points
without
giving
a
particle
of
information
in
return
he
must
play
a
lone
hand
and
a
cautious
one
until
he
found
holcomb
the
fact
of
his
position
did
appall
him
somehow
it
had
just
the
opposite
effect
perhaps
it
was
because
his
strength
had
come
back
and
had
brought
with
it
the
buoyancy
that
is
natural
to
health
he
could
sense
the
vitality
that
surrounded
him
poised
potential
waiting
only
the
proper
attitude
on
his
part
to
become
an
active
force
something
tremendous
had
happened
to
him
to
make
him
feel
like
that
he
was
ready
for
anything
five
minutes
passed
watson
was
alert
and
ready
when
the
woman
returned
together
with
a
companion
she
smiled
kindly
and
announced
the
rhamda
at
first
chick
was
startled
there
was
a
resemblance
to
rhamda
avec
that
ran
almost
to
counterpart
the
same
refinement
and
elegance
the
fleeting
suggestion
of
youth
the
evident
age
mingled
with
the
same
athletic
ease
and
grace
of
carriage
only
he
was
somewhat
shorter
the
eyes
were
almost
identical
with
the
peculiar
quality
of
the
iris
and
pupil
that
suggested
somehow
a
culture
inherited
out
of
the
centuries
he
was
dressed
in
a
black
robe
such
as
would
befit
a
scholar
he
smiled
and
held
out
a
hand
watson
noted
the
firm
clasp
and
the
cold
thrill
of
magnetism
you
wish
to
speak
with
me
the
voice
was
soft
and
modulated
resonant
of
a
tone
as
rich
as
bronze
yes
where
am
i
sir
you
do
not
know
it
seemed
to
watson
that
there
was
real
astonishment
in
the
man
eyes
as
yet
it
had
not
come
to
chick
that
he
himself
might
be
just
as
much
a
mystery
as
the
other
the
only
question
in
his
mind
at
the
moment
was
locality
is
this
the
blind
spot
the
blind
spot
with
the
same
lack
of
comprehension
that
the
woman
had
shown
i
do
not
understand
well
how
did
i
get
here
oh
as
to
that
you
were
found
in
the
temple
of
the
leaf
you
were
lying
unconscious
on
the
a
temple
how
did
i
get
there
sir
do
you
know
we
only
know
that
a
moment
before
there
was
nothing
next
instant
watson
thought
there
was
a
subconscious
sound
that
still
lingered
in
his
memory
a
sound
flooding
enveloping
was
there
any
connection
temple
of
the
leaf
you
call
it
sir
i
seem
to
remember
having
heard
a
bell
is
there
such
a
thing
in
that
temple
the
rhamda
geos
smiled
his
eyes
brightening
it
is
sometimes
called
the
temple
of
the
ah
a
pause
and
watson
asked
where
is
this
temple
and
is
this
room
a
part
of
the
building
no
you
are
in
the
hospital
an
institution
of
the
the
rhamdas
so
there
were
several
of
them
a
sort
of
society
perhaps
in
san
francisco
no
san
francisco
again
i
fail
to
understand
this
locality
is
known
as
the
the
mahovisal
watson
thought
in
silence
for
a
moment
he
noted
the
extremely
keen
interest
of
the
rhamda
the
flicker
of
the
eyes
the
light
of
query
and
critical
analysis
you
call
this
the
mahovisal
sir
what
is
it
town
world
or
institution
the
other
smiled
again
the
lines
about
his
sensitive
mouth
were
susceptible
of
various
interpretations
emotion
or
condescension
or
the
satisfying
feeling
that
comes
from
the
simple
vindication
of
some
inner
conviction
his
whole
manner
was
that
of
interest
and
respectful
wonder
you
have
never
heard
of
the
mahovisal
never
not
until
this
minute
answered
watson
you
have
no
knowledge
of
anything
before
do
you
know
who
you
are
i
watson
hesitated
wondering
whether
he
had
best
withhold
this
information
he
decided
to
chance
the
truth
my
name
is
chick
watson
i
am
an
an
american
the
rhamda
pronounced
the
word
with
a
roll
of
the
r
that
sounded
more
like
the
chinese
mellican
than
anything
else
it
was
evident
that
the
sounds
were
totally
unfamiliar
to
him
and
his
manner
was
a
bit
indefinite
doubtful
yet
weighted
with
care
as
he
slowly
repeated
the
question
an
american
once
more
i
do
understand
i
have
never
heard
the
word
my
dear
sir
you
are
neither
nor
kospian
although
there
are
some
materialists
for
the
most
part
who
contend
that
you
are
just
as
any
one
else
that
is
a
perhaps
i
am
returned
watson
utterly
confounded
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
had
never
heard
of
a
kospian
or
a
nor
of
the
mahovisal
it
made
things
difficult
he
could
get
started
most
of
all
he
wanted
information
and
instead
he
was
being
questioned
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
equivocate
as
for
the
rhamda
he
frowned
apparently
his
eager
interest
had
been
dashed
with
disappointment
but
only
slightly
as
watson
could
see
the
man
was
of
such
culture
and
intellect
as
to
have
perfect
control
over
his
emotions
in
his
balance
and
poise
he
was
very
like
avec
and
he
had
the
same
pleasing
manner
my
dear
sir
he
began
if
you
are
really
a
man
then
you
can
tell
me
something
of
great
i
chick
retorted
can
tell
you
nothing
until
you
first
let
me
know
just
where
i
stand
certainly
there
was
a
lack
of
common
ground
until
one
of
them
supplied
it
there
could
be
no
headway
watson
realised
that
his
whole
future
might
revolve
about
the
axis
of
his
next
words
the
rhamda
thought
a
moment
dubiously
like
one
who
has
had
a
pet
theory
damaged
though
not
shattered
suddenly
he
spoke
to
the
woman
open
the
portal
said
he
she
stepped
to
the
oval
window
touched
a
latch
and
swung
the
pane
horizontally
upon
two
pivots
immediately
the
room
was
flooded
with
a
strange
effulgence
soft
and
mellow
as
real
sunshine
but
it
was
not
real
sunshine
the
window
was
set
in
a
rather
thick
wall
beyond
which
watson
could
see
a
royal
sapphiric
sky
flecked
with
white
and
purple
and
clouds
poised
above
a
great
amber
sleeping
sun
it
was
the
sun
that
challenged
attention
it
was
so
mild
and
yet
so
utterly
beyond
what
might
be
expected
in
diameter
it
would
have
made
six
of
the
one
watson
had
known
in
the
blue
distance
touching
the
rim
of
the
horizon
it
looked
exactly
like
a
huge
golden
plate
set
edgewise
on
the
end
of
the
earth
and
he
could
look
straight
at
it
without
blinking
his
thoughts
ran
back
to
the
first
account
of
the
rhamda
the
man
had
looked
straight
at
the
sun
and
had
been
blinded
this
accounted
for
it
the
man
had
been
accustomed
to
this
huge
beauty
an
amberous
sun
deep
yellow
sleeping
could
it
be
after
all
dreamland
but
there
were
other
things
the
myriad
tintinnabulations
of
these
microscopic
bells
never
ceasing
musically
throbbing
and
now
the
exotic
delight
of
the
softest
of
perfumes
an
air
barely
tinted
with
violet
and
rose
and
the
breath
of
woodland
wild
flowers
he
could
not
comprehend
it
he
looked
at
the
purple
clouds
above
the
lotus
sun
hardly
believing
and
deeply
in
doubt
a
great
white
bird
dived
suddenly
out
of
the
heavens
and
flew
into
the
focus
of
his
vision
in
all
the
tales
of
his
boyhood
of
large
and
beautiful
rocs
and
other
birds
he
had
come
across
nothing
like
this
from
the
perspective
it
must
have
measured
a
full
three
hundred
feet
from
tip
to
tip
it
was
shaped
like
a
swan
and
flew
like
an
eagle
with
magnificent
lazy
sweeps
of
the
wings
while
its
plumage
was
as
white
as
the
snow
new
fallen
on
the
mountains
and
right
behind
it
in
pursuit
hurtled
a
huge
black
thing
fully
as
large
and
just
as
swift
a
tremendous
black
crow
so
black
that
its
sides
gave
off
a
greenish
shimmer
just
then
the
woman
closed
the
window
it
was
as
well
watson
was
only
human
and
he
could
hide
his
curiosity
just
so
long
and
no
longer
he
turned
to
the
rhamda
the
man
nodded
i
thought
so
said
he
with
satisfaction
as
one
might
who
has
proven
a
pet
and
previous
theory
watson
tried
from
another
angle
just
who
do
you
think
i
am
sir
the
other
smiled
as
before
it
is
not
what
i
may
think
he
replied
but
what
i
know
you
are
the
proof
that
was
promised
us
by
the
great
rhamda
avec
you
are
the
fact
and
the
substance
he
waited
for
watson
answer
stupefaction
delayed
it
after
a
moment
the
rhamda
continued
is
it
not
so
am
i
not
right
you
are
surely
out
of
the
occult
my
dear
sir
you
are
a
spirit
it
took
chick
wholly
by
surprise
he
had
been
ready
to
deal
with
anything
but
this
it
was
unreal
weird
impossible
and
yet
why
not
the
professor
had
set
out
to
remove
forever
the
screen
that
had
hitherto
shrouded
the
shadow
but
what
had
he
revealed
what
had
the
spot
disclosed
unreality
or
reality
which
is
which
in
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
chick
saw
that
he
had
reached
the
crossroads
of
the
occult
there
was
no
time
to
think
there
was
time
only
for
a
plunge
and
like
all
strong
men
watson
chose
the
deeper
water
he
turned
to
the
rhamda
geos
yes
said
he
quietly
i
am
a
xxxi
up
for
breath
rhamda
geos
instead
of
showing
the
concern
and
uneasiness
that
most
men
would
show
in
the
presence
of
an
avowed
ghost
evinced
nothing
but
a
deep
and
reverent
happiness
he
took
watson
hand
almost
shyly
and
while
his
manner
was
not
effusive
it
had
the
warmth
that
comes
from
the
heart
of
a
scholar
as
a
rhamda
he
declared
i
must
commend
myself
for
being
the
first
to
speak
to
you
and
i
must
congratulate
you
my
dear
sir
on
having
fallen
not
into
the
hands
of
bar
senestro
but
into
those
of
my
own
kind
it
is
a
proof
of
the
prophecy
and
a
vindication
of
the
wisdom
of
the
ten
thousand
i
bid
you
welcome
to
the
thomahlia
and
i
offer
you
my
services
as
guide
and
chick
did
not
reply
at
once
the
chance
he
had
taken
was
one
of
those
rare
decisions
that
come
to
genius
the
whole
balance
of
his
fate
might
swing
upon
his
sudden
impulse
not
that
he
had
any
compunction
but
he
felt
that
it
tied
him
down
it
restricted
him
certainly
almost
any
role
would
be
easier
than
that
of
a
spirit
he
did
feel
like
a
ghost
he
wondered
just
how
a
ghost
would
act
anyhow
what
was
more
he
could
not
understand
such
a
queer
assumption
on
the
rhamda
part
why
had
he
seemed
to
want
chick
a
ghost
watson
was
natural
human
embodied
just
like
the
rhamda
this
was
scarcely
his
idea
of
a
phantom
life
most
certainly
the
two
of
them
were
men
nothing
else
if
one
was
a
wraith
so
was
the
other
but
how
to
account
for
it
again
he
thought
of
rhamda
avec
the
words
of
geos
the
fact
and
the
substance
had
been
exactly
synonymous
with
what
had
been
said
of
avec
by
holcomb
the
proof
of
the
was
it
indeed
possible
that
these
two
great
ones
from
opposite
poles
had
actually
torn
away
the
veil
of
the
shadow
and
was
this
the
place
where
he
watson
must
pose
as
a
spirit
if
he
were
to
be
accepted
as
genuine
the
thought
was
a
shock
he
must
play
the
same
part
here
that
the
rhamda
had
played
on
the
other
side
of
the
spot
but
he
would
have
to
do
it
without
the
guiding
wisdom
of
avec
besides
there
was
something
sinister
in
the
unknown
force
that
had
engulfed
so
strong
a
mind
as
the
professor
for
while
watson
fate
had
been
of
his
own
seeking
that
of
the
doctor
smacked
too
much
of
treachery
he
turned
to
the
rhamda
geos
with
a
new
question
this
rhamda
avec
was
he
a
man
like
yourself
the
other
brightened
again
and
asked
in
return
then
you
have
seen
him
i
i
do
not
know
answered
watson
caught
off
his
guard
but
the
name
is
familiar
i
do
remember
well
my
mind
is
vague
and
confused
i
recall
a
world
a
wonderful
world
it
was
from
which
i
came
and
a
great
many
people
but
i
ca
place
myself
i
hardly
let
me
see
the
other
nodded
sympathetic
approval
i
understand
do
exert
yourself
it
is
hardly
to
be
expected
that
one
forced
out
of
the
occult
could
come
among
us
with
his
faculties
unimpaired
we
have
had
many
communications
with
your
world
and
have
always
been
frustrated
by
this
one
gulf
which
may
not
be
crossed
when
real
thought
gets
across
the
border
it
is
often
indefinite
sometimes
mere
drivel
such
answers
as
come
from
the
void
are
usually
disappointing
no
matter
how
expert
our
mediums
may
be
in
communicating
with
the
the
dead
did
you
say
the
dead
certainly
the
dead
are
you
not
of
the
dead
watson
shook
his
head
emphatically
absolutely
not
not
where
i
came
from
we
are
all
very
much
alive
the
other
watched
him
curiously
his
great
eyes
glowing
with
enthusiasm
the
enthusiasm
of
the
born
seeker
of
the
truth
you
do
mean
he
asked
that
you
have
the
same
passions
that
we
have
here
in
life
i
mean
said
watson
that
we
hate
love
swear
we
are
good
and
we
are
evil
and
we
play
games
and
go
geos
rubbed
his
hands
in
a
dignified
sort
of
glee
what
had
been
said
coincided
apparently
with
another
of
his
pet
theories
it
is
splendid
he
exulted
splendid
and
just
in
line
with
my
thesis
you
shall
tell
it
before
the
council
of
the
rhamdas
it
will
be
the
greatest
day
since
the
speaking
of
the
jarados
watson
wondered
just
who
this
jarados
might
be
but
for
the
moment
he
went
back
to
the
previous
question
this
rhamda
avec
you
were
about
to
tell
me
about
him
let
me
have
as
much
as
i
can
understand
ah
yes
the
great
rhamda
avec
perhaps
you
may
recall
him
when
your
mind
clears
a
little
more
my
dear
sir
he
is
or
was
the
chief
of
the
rhamdas
of
all
the
what
is
the
the
thomahlia
why
it
is
called
the
world
our
name
for
the
world
it
comprises
physically
land
water
and
air
politically
it
embraces
kospia
and
a
few
minor
who
are
the
rhamdas
they
are
the
heads
of
of
the
thomahlia
not
the
nominal
nor
political
nor
religious
heads
they
are
neither
judicial
executive
nor
legislative
but
the
real
heads
still
above
they
might
be
called
the
supreme
college
of
wisdom
of
science
and
of
research
also
they
are
the
keepers
of
the
bell
and
its
temple
and
the
interpreters
of
the
prophecy
of
the
i
see
you
are
a
sort
of
no
the
priesthood
is
below
us
the
priests
take
what
orders
we
choose
to
give
and
are
purely
superstitious
the
rhamda
eyes
snapped
just
a
trifle
not
at
all
my
dear
sir
they
are
good
sincere
men
only
not
being
intellectually
adept
enough
to
be
admitted
to
the
real
secrets
the
real
knowledge
they
give
to
all
things
a
provisional
explanation
based
upon
a
settled
policy
not
being
rhamdas
they
are
simply
not
aware
that
everything
has
an
exact
and
absolute
in
other
words
put
in
watson
they
are
scientists
they
have
not
lifted
themselves
up
to
the
plane
of
inquisitive
still
the
rhamda
shook
his
head
not
quite
that
either
my
dear
sir
those
below
us
are
not
ignorant
they
are
merely
nearer
to
the
level
of
the
masses
than
we
are
in
fact
they
are
the
people
rulers
these
priests
and
other
similar
classes
but
we
the
rhamdas
are
the
rulers
of
the
rulers
we
differ
from
them
in
that
we
have
no
material
ends
to
subserve
being
at
the
top
with
no
motive
save
justice
and
advancement
our
judgments
are
never
questioned
and
for
the
same
reason
seldom
passed
but
we
are
far
above
the
plane
of
doubt
that
you
speak
of
we
passed
out
of
it
long
ago
that
is
the
first
stage
of
true
science
afterwards
comes
the
higher
levels
where
all
things
have
a
reason
ethics
inspiration
thought
emotion
and
the
judgment
of
the
jarados
watson
could
not
have
told
why
he
said
it
it
was
impulse
and
the
impromptu
suggestion
of
a
but
the
effect
of
his
words
upon
the
rhamda
and
the
nurse
told
him
that
inadvertently
he
had
struck
a
keynote
both
started
especially
the
woman
watson
took
note
of
this
in
particular
because
of
the
ingrained
acceptance
of
the
feminine
in
matter
of
belief
what
do
you
know
was
her
eager
interruption
you
have
seen
the
jarados
as
for
the
rhamda
he
looked
at
watson
with
shrewd
calculating
eyes
but
they
were
still
filled
with
wonder
can
you
tell
us
he
asked
try
and
think
chick
knew
that
he
had
gained
a
point
he
had
been
dealt
a
trump
card
but
he
was
too
clever
to
play
it
at
once
he
was
on
his
own
responsibility
and
was
carrying
a
load
that
required
the
finest
equilibrium
i
really
do
not
know
he
said
i
i
must
have
time
to
think
coming
across
the
border
that
way
you
must
give
me
time
you
were
telling
me
about
the
rhamdas
in
general
now
tell
me
about
avec
in
geos
nodded
as
though
he
could
understand
the
fog
that
beclouded
watson
mind
the
rhamda
avec
is
or
was
the
wisest
of
them
all
the
head
and
the
chief
and
by
far
the
most
able
few
beside
his
own
fellows
knew
it
however
another
than
he
was
the
nominal
head
and
officiated
for
him
whenever
necessary
avec
had
little
social
intercourse
he
was
a
prodigious
student
we
are
a
body
of
learned
men
you
understand
and
we
stand
at
the
peak
of
all
that
has
been
discovered
through
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
centuries
so
that
at
the
present
day
we
are
the
culmination
of
the
combined
effort
and
thought
of
man
since
the
beginning
of
time
each
generation
of
rhamdas
must
be
greater
than
the
one
preceding
when
i
die
and
pass
on
to
your
world
i
must
leave
something
new
and
to
my
successor
some
thought
wisdom
or
deed
that
may
be
of
use
to
mankind
i
can
not
be
a
rhamda
else
we
are
a
set
of
supreme
priests
who
serve
man
at
the
shrine
of
intelligence
not
of
dogma
of
course
we
are
not
to
be
judged
too
highly
all
research
when
it
steps
forward
must
go
haltingly
there
are
many
paths
into
the
unknown
that
look
like
the
real
one
hence
we
have
among
us
various
schools
of
thought
and
each
following
a
different
trail
i
myself
am
a
spiritist
i
believe
that
we
can
and
often
have
communicated
with
your
world
at
various
times
there
are
others
who
do
not
grant
it
there
are
rhamdas
who
are
inclined
to
lean
more
to
the
materialist
side
of
things
who
rely
entirely
when
it
comes
to
questions
of
this
kind
upon
their
faith
in
the
teachings
of
the
jarados
there
are
some
too
who
believe
in
the
value
of
speculation
and
who
contend
that
only
through
contemplation
can
man
lift
himself
to
the
full
fruits
of
realisation
at
the
head
of
us
all
the
rhamda
avec
what
was
his
belief
let
us
say
he
believed
all
he
was
eclectic
he
held
that
we
were
all
of
us
a
bit
right
and
each
of
us
a
whole
lot
wrong
it
was
his
contention
however
that
there
was
not
one
thing
that
could
not
be
proven
that
the
secret
of
life
while
undoubtedly
a
secret
in
every
sense
of
the
word
is
still
very
concrete
it
could
be
proven
watson
nodded
he
remembered
hearing
another
man
make
just
such
a
statement
holcomb
for
years
he
worked
in
private
went
on
geos
we
never
knew
just
what
he
was
doing
until
one
day
he
called
us
together
and
delivered
his
his
lecture
rather
his
prophecy
for
it
was
all
that
not
that
he
spoke
at
great
length
it
was
but
a
talk
he
announced
that
he
believed
the
time
had
come
to
prove
the
occult
that
it
could
be
done
and
done
only
through
concrete
material
means
and
that
whatever
existed
certainly
could
be
demonstrated
he
was
going
to
pull
aside
the
curtain
that
had
hitherto
cut
off
the
shadow
am
going
to
prove
the
occult
he
said
three
days
i
shall
return
with
the
fact
and
the
substance
and
then
i
propose
to
deliver
my
greatest
lecture
my
final
thesis
in
which
my
whole
life
shall
come
to
a
focus
i
shall
bring
the
proof
for
your
eyes
and
ears
for
your
fingers
to
explore
and
be
satisfied
you
shall
behold
the
living
the
subject
of
my
lecture
the
subject
of
my
lecture
will
be
the
spot
of
life
xxxii
through
unknown
waters
the
spot
of
life
and
the
subject
of
holcomb
lecture
promised
but
never
delivered
had
been
announced
as
the
blind
spot
to
watson
it
was
fairly
astounding
to
discover
that
the
two
holcomb
and
avec
had
reached
simultaneously
for
the
curtain
of
the
shadow
the
professor
had
said
that
it
would
be
the
greatest
day
since
and
so
it
had
proven
did
the
world
but
know
it
and
the
rhamda
avec
never
returned
asked
chick
but
he
sent
back
something
within
three
days
watson
was
thinking
of
course
of
the
doctor
who
had
disappeared
on
the
day
which
jerome
overheard
the
rhamda
to
say
was
the
last
of
his
stay
but
geos
did
not
reply
why
chick
could
not
guess
he
thought
it
best
not
to
press
the
question
in
good
time
if
he
went
at
it
carefully
he
could
gain
his
end
with
safety
at
the
moment
he
must
not
arouse
suspicion
he
chose
another
query
did
avec
go
alone
no
the
nervina
went
with
him
rather
she
followed
within
a
few
ah
it
was
out
before
watson
could
think
the
rhamda
looked
up
suddenly
then
you
have
seen
the
nervina
you
know
her
chick
lied
it
was
not
his
intention
just
at
present
to
tie
himself
down
to
anything
that
might
prove
compromising
or
restraining
the
name
is
familiar
who
is
this
nervina
she
is
one
of
the
queens
i
thought
my
dear
sir
she
is
one
of
the
queens
of
thomahlia
half
kospian
half
of
the
first
royal
line
running
through
from
the
day
of
the
chick
cogitated
for
a
moment
then
taking
an
entirely
new
tack
you
say
the
rhamda
and
this
nervina
independently
solved
the
mystery
of
the
spot
of
life
i
believe
you
call
it
and
that
spot
leads
apparently
into
the
occult
apparently
if
not
positively
it
was
the
wisdom
of
avec
mostly
he
had
been
in
communication
with
your
world
by
means
of
his
own
discovery
and
application
it
was
all
in
line
with
the
prophecy
since
he
and
the
nervina
left
the
people
of
the
world
have
been
in
a
state
of
ferment
for
it
was
foretold
that
in
the
last
days
we
would
get
in
communication
with
the
other
side
that
some
would
come
and
some
would
go
for
example
your
own
coming
was
foretold
by
the
jarados
almost
to
the
hour
and
then
it
was
fortuitous
spoke
watson
it
was
not
the
wisdom
and
science
of
avec
in
my
quite
so
however
it
is
proof
that
the
rhamdas
have
fulfilled
their
duty
we
knew
of
the
spot
of
life
all
the
while
it
was
to
be
closed
until
we
through
the
effort
of
our
intellect
and
virtues
could
lift
ourselves
up
to
the
plane
of
the
world
beyond
us
your
world
it
could
not
be
opened
by
ourselves
alone
however
the
rhamda
avec
had
first
to
get
in
touch
with
your
side
before
he
could
apply
the
laws
he
had
somehow
chick
admired
this
rhamda
men
of
his
type
could
form
but
one
kind
of
priesthood
exalted
and
devoted
to
the
advance
of
intelligence
if
rhamda
avec
were
of
the
same
sort
then
he
was
a
man
to
be
looked
up
to
not
to
hate
as
for
the
jarados
watson
could
not
make
out
who
he
had
been
a
prophet
or
teacher
seemingly
looming
out
of
the
past
and
reverenced
from
antiquity
the
blind
spot
became
a
shade
less
sinister
already
watson
had
the
temple
of
the
leaf
or
bell
the
rhamdas
and
their
philosophy
the
great
amber
sun
the
huge
birds
the
musical
cadence
of
the
perfumed
air
and
the
of
rhamda
avec
to
weigh
against
the
work
and
words
of
holcomb
the
world
of
the
blind
spot
as
if
in
reaction
from
the
unaccustomed
train
of
thought
watson
suddenly
became
conscious
of
extreme
hunger
he
gave
an
uneasy
glance
round
a
glance
which
the
rhamda
geos
smilingly
interpreted
at
a
word
the
woman
left
the
room
and
returned
with
a
crimson
garment
like
a
when
chick
had
donned
it
and
a
pair
of
silken
slippers
geos
bade
him
follow
they
stepped
out
into
the
corridor
this
was
formed
and
coloured
much
as
the
room
they
had
quitted
and
it
led
to
another
apartment
much
larger
about
fifty
feet
across
coloured
a
deep
cool
green
its
ceiling
coved
like
the
other
seemed
made
of
some
substance
from
which
came
both
light
and
heat
four
or
five
tables
looking
like
ebony
work
were
arranged
along
the
side
walls
when
they
were
seated
at
one
of
these
the
rhamda
placed
his
fingers
on
some
round
buttons
ranged
along
the
edge
of
the
table
in
your
world
he
apologised
our
clumsy
service
would
doubtless
amuse
you
but
it
is
the
best
we
have
been
able
to
devise
so
he
pressed
the
button
instantly
without
the
slightest
sound
or
anything
else
to
betray
just
how
the
thing
had
been
accomplished
the
table
was
covered
with
golden
dishes
heaped
with
food
and
two
goblets
full
to
the
brim
with
a
dark
greenish
liquid
that
gave
off
an
aroma
almost
exhilarating
not
alcoholic
but
something
just
above
that
the
rhamda
disregarding
or
not
noticing
watson
gasp
of
wonder
lifted
his
goblet
in
the
manner
of
the
host
in
health
and
welcome
you
may
drink
it
he
offered
without
fear
it
is
not
liquor
if
i
may
use
a
word
which
i
believe
to
be
current
in
your
world
i
may
add
that
it
is
one
of
the
best
things
that
we
shall
be
able
to
offer
you
while
you
are
with
indeed
it
was
liquor
watson
took
a
sip
and
he
made
a
mental
note
that
if
all
things
in
the
thomahlia
were
on
a
par
with
this
then
he
certainly
was
in
a
world
far
above
his
own
for
the
one
sip
was
enough
to
send
a
thrill
through
his
veins
a
thrill
not
unlike
the
ecstasy
of
supreme
music
a
sparkling
exuberance
leaving
the
mind
clear
and
scintillating
glorified
to
the
quick
thinking
of
genius
later
watson
experienced
no
reaction
such
as
would
have
come
from
drinking
alcohol
or
any
other
drug
it
was
the
strangest
meal
ever
eaten
by
watson
the
food
was
very
savoury
and
perfectly
cooked
and
served
only
one
dish
reminded
him
of
meat
you
have
meats
he
asked
this
looks
like
geos
shook
his
head
no
do
you
have
flesh
to
eat
on
the
other
side
we
make
all
our
make
food
watson
thought
best
simply
to
answer
the
question
as
i
remember
it
rhamda
geos
we
had
a
sort
of
meat
called
beef
the
flesh
of
certain
the
rhamda
was
intensely
interested
are
they
large
some
interpret
the
jarados
to
that
effect
tell
me
are
they
like
this
and
he
pulled
a
silver
whistle
from
his
pocket
and
placing
it
to
his
lips
blew
two
short
shrill
notes
immediately
a
peculiar
patter
sounded
down
the
corridor
a
not
unlike
galloping
before
watson
could
do
any
surmising
a
little
bundle
of
shining
black
rounded
the
entrance
to
the
room
and
ran
up
to
them
geos
picked
it
up
it
was
a
horse
a
horse
beautifully
formed
perfect
as
an
arab
and
not
more
than
nine
inches
high
now
chick
had
been
in
the
blind
spot
conscious
but
a
short
while
he
knew
that
he
was
in
the
precise
position
that
rhamda
avec
had
occupied
that
morning
on
the
chick
recalled
the
pictures
of
the
lilliputian
deer
and
the
miniature
kittens
yet
he
was
immensely
surprised
the
little
fellow
began
to
neigh
a
tiny
ridiculous
sound
as
compared
with
the
blast
of
a
horse
and
began
to
paw
for
the
edge
of
the
table
what
does
he
want
a
drink
they
will
do
anything
for
geos
pressed
a
button
and
in
a
moment
he
had
another
goblet
this
he
held
before
the
little
stallion
who
thrust
his
head
in
above
his
nostrils
and
drank
as
greedily
as
a
percheron
weighing
a
ton
watson
stroked
his
sides
the
mane
was
like
spun
silk
he
felt
the
legs
symmetrical
perfectly
shaped
not
as
large
above
the
fetlocks
as
an
ordinary
pencil
are
they
all
of
this
size
yes
all
of
them
why
do
you
ask
because
seeing
no
harm
in
telling
this
as
i
remember
them
a
horse
on
the
other
side
would
make
a
thousand
of
this
one
people
ride
the
rhamda
nodded
so
it
is
told
in
the
books
of
jarados
we
had
such
beasts
once
ourselves
we
would
have
them
still
but
for
the
brutality
and
stupidity
of
our
ancestors
it
is
the
one
great
sin
of
the
thomahlia
once
we
had
animals
great
and
small
and
all
the
blessings
of
nature
we
had
horses
and
i
think
what
you
call
beef
a
thousand
other
creatures
that
were
food
and
help
and
companions
to
man
and
for
the
good
they
had
done
our
ancestors
destroyed
them
why
it
was
neglect
unthinking
and
selfish
a
time
came
when
our
civilisation
made
it
possible
to
live
without
other
creatures
when
machinery
came
into
vogue
we
put
aside
the
animals
as
useless
those
we
had
no
further
use
for
we
denied
the
right
to
reproduce
the
game
of
the
forest
was
hunted
down
with
powerful
weapons
of
destruction
all
went
in
a
century
or
two
everything
that
could
be
killed
and
with
them
went
the
age
of
our
highest
art
that
age
of
domesticated
animals
our
greatest
paintings
our
noblest
sculpture
came
from
that
age
all
the
priceless
relics
that
we
call
classic
and
in
its
stead
we
had
the
mechanical
age
man
likewise
became
a
mechanism
emotionless
with
no
taste
for
nature
meat
was
made
synthetically
and
so
was
you
do
mean
to
say
they
did
not
preserve
cows
for
the
sake
of
their
milk
no
that
kind
of
milk
became
men
regarded
it
as
unsanitary
fit
only
for
the
calves
what
they
wanted
was
something
chemically
pure
they
waged
war
on
bacteria
microbes
and
nature
in
general
a
cow
was
merely
a
relic
whose
product
was
always
an
uncertainty
with
no
reason
for
the
meat
and
no
use
for
the
milk
our
vegetarians
and
our
purists
gradually
eliminated
them
altogether
it
was
a
strange
age
utilitarian
scientific
selfish
it
was
then
headed
straight
for
and
he
went
on
to
relate
how
men
began
to
lose
the
power
of
emotion
there
were
no
dependent
beasts
to
leaven
his
nature
with
the
salt
of
kindness
he
thought
only
of
his
own
aggrandisement
he
became
like
his
machine
a
fine
thing
of
perfectly
correlated
parts
but
with
no
higher
nature
no
soul
no
feeling
he
was
less
than
a
brute
the
animals
disappeared
one
by
one
passing
through
the
channel
of
death
into
the
world
beyond
the
spot
of
life
leaving
behind
only
these
tiny
survivors
playthings
kept
in
existence
longer
than
all
others
because
of
a
mere
fad
does
your
spiritism
include
animals
as
well
as
men
naturally
everything
that
is
endowed
with
i
see
let
me
ask
you
why
did
the
rhamdas
interfere
and
put
a
stop
to
this
wanton
sacrilege
against
nature
the
rhamda
smiled
you
forget
replied
he
that
these
events
belong
far
in
the
past
at
that
time
the
rhamdas
were
not
it
was
even
before
the
coming
of
the
watson
asked
no
more
questions
for
a
while
he
wanted
to
think
how
could
this
man
rhamda
geos
if
indeed
he
were
a
man
accept
him
watson
as
a
spirit
solid
flesh
was
not
exactly
in
line
with
his
idea
of
the
unearthly
how
to
explain
it
he
had
to
go
back
to
holcomb
again
the
doctor
had
accepted
without
question
avec
naturalness
his
body
his
appetite
reasonably
enough
geos
with
some
smattering
of
his
superior
wisdom
should
accept
watson
in
the
same
way
and
then
the
jarados
at
every
moment
his
name
had
cropped
up
who
was
he
so
far
he
had
heard
no
word
that
might
be
construed
as
a
clue
the
great
point
just
now
was
that
the
rhamda
geos
accepted
him
as
a
spirit
as
the
fact
and
substance
promised
by
avec
but
where
was
the
doctor
chick
ventured
this
question
my
coming
was
foretold
by
the
rhamda
avec
i
understand
is
this
in
accord
with
the
words
of
the
jarados
the
rhamda
looked
up
expectantly
and
spoke
with
evident
anxiety
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
the
jarados
let
us
forgo
that
watson
possibly
i
can
tell
you
much
that
you
would
like
to
know
what
i
want
to
know
is
just
how
well
prepared
you
are
to
receive
me
then
you
come
from
the
jarados
what
do
you
know
about
him
this
someone
should
have
preceded
me
the
fact
and
the
were
to
have
it
inside
three
days
it
has
been
several
hundred
times
the
space
allotted
is
it
not
so
the
rhamda
eyes
were
with
eagerness
then
it
is
true
you
are
from
the
jarados
you
know
the
great
rhamda
avec
you
have
seen
him
i
have
declared
watson
in
the
other
world
you
can
remember
yes
again
committing
himself
i
have
seen
avec
in
another
world
but
tell
me
before
we
go
on
i
would
have
an
answer
to
my
question
did
anyone
precede
me
watson
was
nonplussed
but
he
concealed
the
fact
are
you
sure
quite
my
dear
sir
the
spot
of
life
was
watched
continually
from
the
moment
the
rhamda
left
you
mean
he
and
the
nervina
quite
so
she
followed
him
after
an
interval
of
a
few
i
know
but
you
say
that
no
one
came
out
ahead
of
me
who
was
it
that
guarded
this
this
spot
of
life
the
rhamdas
they
and
the
ah
and
who
are
the
bars
the
military
priesthood
they
are
the
mahovisal
and
of
the
temple
of
the
bell
they
are
led
by
the
great
bar
and
there
were
times
when
these
bars
led
by
this
senestro
held
guard
over
the
spot
of
life
to
this
geos
nodded
and
watson
went
on
and
who
is
this
great
senestro
he
is
the
chief
of
the
bars
and
a
prince
of
he
is
the
affianced
of
the
two
queens
the
aradna
and
the
the
two
of
them
whereupon
watson
learned
something
rather
peculiar
it
seemed
that
the
princes
of
had
always
married
the
queens
this
senestro
had
had
a
brother
but
he
died
and
in
such
an
event
it
was
the
iron
custom
that
the
surviving
brother
marry
both
queens
it
had
happened
only
once
before
in
all
history
but
the
precedent
was
unbreakable
then
there
is
nothing
against
it
nothing
except
perhaps
the
prophecy
of
the
jarados
we
now
know
the
whole
world
knows
that
we
are
fast
approaching
the
day
of
of
course
the
day
of
watson
decided
upon
another
chance
shot
it
has
to
do
with
the
marriage
of
the
two
queens
you
do
know
cried
the
rhamda
joyously
tell
me
no
it
is
i
who
am
asking
the
watson
mind
was
working
like
lightning
whether
it
was
the
influence
of
the
strange
drink
or
the
equally
strange
influence
of
ordinary
inspiration
he
was
never
more
in
his
life
it
seemed
a
day
for
taking
long
chances
tell
me
he
inquired
what
has
the
day
of
life
to
do
with
the
two
queens
and
their
betrothal
the
rhamda
throttled
his
eagerness
it
is
one
of
the
obscure
points
of
the
prophecy
there
are
some
scholars
who
hold
that
such
a
problem
as
this
presages
the
coming
of
the
end
and
the
advent
of
the
chosen
but
others
oppose
this
interpretation
for
reasons
purely
material
for
if
the
bar
senestro
should
marry
both
queens
it
would
make
him
the
sole
ruler
of
the
thomahlia
only
once
before
have
we
had
a
single
ruler
for
centuries
upon
centuries
we
have
had
two
queens
one
of
the
and
the
other
of
the
kospians
enthroned
here
in
the
watson
would
have
liked
to
learn
far
more
but
the
time
seemed
one
for
action
on
his
part
bold
action
and
positive
rhamda
geos
i
do
not
know
what
is
your
version
of
the
prophecy
but
you
are
positive
that
no
one
preceded
me
out
of
the
spot
i
am
why
do
you
persist
because
speaking
slowly
and
with
the
greatest
care
because
there
was
one
greater
than
i
who
came
before
me
the
rhamda
rose
excitedly
to
his
feet
and
then
sank
back
into
his
chair
again
in
his
eyes
was
nothing
save
eagerness
wonder
and
respect
he
leaned
forward
who
was
it
who
was
he
watson
voice
was
steady
as
stone
the
great
jarados
himself
xxxiii
a
long
way
from
shore
once
more
watson
had
taken
the
kind
of
chance
he
preferred
a
slender
one
he
took
the
chance
that
these
people
however
occult
and
advanced
they
might
be
were
still
human
enough
to
build
their
prophecy
out
of
an
old
foundation
if
he
were
right
then
the
person
of
the
jarados
would
be
inviolable
if
the
professor
were
prisoner
held
somewhere
in
secret
and
it
got
noised
about
that
he
was
the
true
prophet
returned
it
would
not
only
give
holcomb
immense
prestige
but
at
the
same
time
render
the
position
of
his
captors
untenable
chick
needed
no
great
discernment
to
see
that
he
had
touched
a
vital
spot
the
philosophy
of
the
rhamdas
was
firmly
bound
up
with
spiritism
they
had
gone
far
in
science
and
had
passed
out
of
mere
belief
into
the
deeper
finer
understanding
that
went
behind
the
shadow
for
proof
certainly
watson
inwardly
rejoiced
to
see
rhamda
geos
incredulous
his
keen
face
whitening
like
that
of
one
who
has
just
heard
sacrilege
uttered
to
see
geos
rise
in
his
place
grip
the
table
tightly
and
hear
him
exclaim
the
jarados
did
you
say
the
jarados
he
has
come
amongst
us
and
we
have
not
known
you
are
perfectly
sure
of
this
i
am
stated
watson
and
met
the
other
keen
scrutiny
without
flinching
would
the
game
work
at
least
it
promised
action
and
now
that
he
had
the
old
feeling
of
himself
he
was
anxious
to
get
under
way
any
feeling
of
fear
was
gone
now
he
calmly
nodded
his
head
yes
it
is
so
but
sit
down
i
have
still
a
bit
more
to
tell
the
rhamda
resumed
his
seat
clearly
his
reverence
had
been
greatly
augmented
in
the
past
few
seconds
from
that
time
on
there
was
a
marked
difference
in
his
manner
and
his
speech
when
he
addressed
chick
contained
the
expression
my
lord
an
expression
that
watson
found
it
easy
enough
to
become
accustomed
to
did
you
doubt
rhamda
geos
that
i
came
from
the
jarados
we
did
not
doubt
we
were
i
see
you
were
not
expecting
the
not
yet
my
lord
the
coming
of
the
jarados
shall
be
close
to
the
day
of
the
judgment
but
it
could
not
be
so
soon
there
were
to
be
signs
and
portents
we
were
to
solve
the
problem
first
we
were
to
know
the
reason
of
the
shadow
and
the
why
of
the
spirit
the
wisdom
of
the
rhamda
avec
told
that
the
day
approaches
he
had
opened
the
spot
of
life
and
gone
through
it
but
he
had
not
sent
the
fact
and
the
watson
smiled
there
was
just
enough
superstition
it
seemed
beneath
all
the
rhamda
wisdom
to
make
him
tractable
however
chick
asked
tell
me
as
a
learned
man
as
a
rhamda
do
you
believe
in
the
prophecy
implicitly
yes
my
lord
i
am
a
spiritist
and
if
spiritism
is
truth
then
the
jarados
was
genuine
and
his
prophecy
is
true
after
all
my
lord
it
is
not
a
case
of
legend
but
of
history
the
jarados
came
at
a
time
of
high
civilisation
when
men
would
see
and
understand
him
he
gave
us
his
teaching
in
records
and
imposed
his
laws
upon
the
thomahlia
then
he
departed
through
the
spot
of
and
the
rhamda
geos
went
on
to
say
that
the
teachings
of
the
jarados
had
been
moral
as
well
as
intellectual
moreover
after
he
had
formulated
his
laws
he
wrote
out
his
judgment
what
was
that
an
exhortation
my
lord
that
we
were
to
give
proof
of
our
appreciation
of
intelligence
we
were
to
use
it
and
to
prove
ourselves
worthy
of
it
by
lifting
ourselves
up
to
the
level
of
the
spot
of
life
in
other
words
the
spot
would
be
opened
when
and
only
when
we
had
learned
the
secrets
of
the
occult
and
had
opened
the
spot
ourselves
watson
thought
he
understood
partly
he
asked
and
that
is
why
you
doubt
me
you
my
lord
not
so
you
were
found
in
the
temple
of
the
bell
and
leaf
not
on
the
spot
itself
to
be
sure
but
on
the
floor
of
the
temple
you
were
both
in
your
person
and
in
your
dress
of
another
world
you
had
been
promised
by
the
rhamda
avec
and
in
a
sense
you
were
a
part
of
the
prophecy
we
accepted
you
but
i
speak
your
language
account
for
that
it
need
not
be
accounted
for
my
lord
we
accept
it
as
fact
the
affinity
of
spirit
would
not
be
bound
by
the
limitation
of
artificial
speech
that
you
should
talk
the
thomahlia
language
is
no
more
strange
than
that
rhamda
avec
when
he
passed
into
your
world
should
speak
your
we
call
our
language
english
supplied
watson
it
is
the
tongue
of
the
jarados
and
of
tell
me
of
the
jarados
my
lord
with
renewed
eagerness
in
the
other
world
what
is
he
it
was
chick
opportunity
by
telling
the
simple
truth
about
holcomb
he
would
enhance
himself
in
the
eyes
of
rhamda
geas
in
the
other
world
we
call
it
america
the
jaradas
is
a
rhamda
much
like
yourself
the
head
and
chief
of
many
rhamdas
sitting
in
a
great
institution
devoted
to
intelligence
it
is
called
the
university
of
and
this
california
what
is
it
my
lord
a
name
returned
chick
immediately
on
the
other
side
of
the
spot
is
a
region
called
the
promised
land
my
lord
the
promised
land
indeed
there
are
some
who
call
it
paradise
even
and
for
good
measure
he
proceeded
to
tell
much
of
his
own
land
of
the
woods
the
rivers
the
cities
animals
mountains
the
sky
the
moon
and
the
sun
when
he
came
to
the
sun
he
explained
that
no
man
dared
to
look
at
it
continuously
with
the
bare
eyes
its
great
heat
and
splendour
astounded
geos
concerning
himself
he
nonchalantly
stated
that
he
was
the
fiance
of
holcomb
daughter
that
is
of
the
prophet
jarados
that
he
was
sort
of
junior
rhamda
he
declared
that
he
had
come
from
the
occult
rhamdas
through
the
other
side
of
the
spot
in
search
of
the
jarados
who
had
gone
before
as
to
his
blankness
up
to
now
and
his
perplexity
he
was
but
a
junior
and
the
spot
had
naturally
benumbed
his
senses
even
now
he
apologised
it
was
difficult
to
know
and
to
recall
everything
clearly
through
it
all
the
rhamda
geos
listened
in
something
like
awe
he
was
hearing
of
wonders
never
before
guessed
in
the
thomahlia
as
the
prospective
of
the
jarados
watson
automatically
lifted
himself
to
a
supreme
height
so
great
that
could
he
only
hold
himself
up
to
it
he
would
have
a
prestige
second
only
to
that
of
the
prophet
himself
all
of
a
sudden
he
thought
of
a
question
it
gripped
him
with
dread
the
dread
of
the
unknown
the
question
was
one
of
time
how
long
have
i
been
here
rhamda
geos
over
eleven
months
by
our
system
of
reckoning
you
were
found
on
the
floor
of
the
temple
three
hundred
and
days
ago
you
were
in
a
lifeless
condition
you
must
have
been
there
some
hours
my
lord
before
we
discovered
eleven
months
it
had
seemed
but
that
many
minutes
and
i
was
unconscious
all
the
time
my
lord
had
we
caught
you
immediately
upon
your
coming
we
could
have
brought
you
around
within
three
days
but
in
the
circumstances
it
was
impossible
to
restore
you
before
we
did
you
have
been
under
the
care
of
the
greatest
specialists
in
all
geos
himself
had
been
one
of
these
the
council
of
rhamdas
went
into
special
session
my
lord
immediately
after
your
materialisation
and
has
been
sitting
almost
continually
since
and
now
that
you
are
revived
they
are
waiting
in
person
for
you
to
show
yourself
they
accept
you
they
do
not
know
who
you
are
my
lord
none
of
us
has
guessed
even
a
part
of
the
truth
the
entire
council
awaits
but
chick
wanted
more
besides
he
looked
at
his
clothing
i
would
have
my
own
garments
geos
also
whatever
else
was
found
on
my
for
watson
was
thinking
of
a
small
but
powerful
pistol
an
automatic
that
he
had
carried
on
the
night
when
he
fell
through
the
blind
spot
this
question
of
materiality
was
still
a
puzzle
if
he
himself
had
survived
there
was
a
chance
that
the
firearm
had
done
the
same
it
might
and
it
might
not
preclude
the
occult
anyway
he
treasured
the
thought
of
that
automatic
with
it
in
his
possession
he
would
not
be
in
case
of
emergency
they
returned
to
the
room
in
which
chick
had
awakened
the
rhamda
left
him
a
few
moments
later
he
came
back
with
a
squad
of
men
chick
noted
their
discipline
movement
and
uniforms
and
classed
them
as
soldiers
two
men
were
stationed
outside
the
door
one
a
stout
dark
individual
in
a
blue
uniform
and
the
other
a
lithe
athletic
chap
blond
and
wearing
a
bright
crimson
dress
chick
instinctively
preferred
both
man
and
garb
in
crimson
there
was
a
touch
of
honour
of
lightness
and
strength
that
just
suited
him
the
other
was
dark
heavy
and
sinister
both
wore
sandals
and
upon
their
heads
curious
shakos
made
of
the
finest
down
not
fur
both
displayed
a
heavy
silken
braid
looped
from
one
shoulder
each
carried
a
weapon
of
some
shining
black
material
to
a
but
no
other
arms
watson
pointed
to
the
two
uniforms
what
is
the
significance
geos
one
is
from
the
queen
my
lord
the
other
from
bar
senestro
the
blue
is
the
cloth
of
the
bars
the
red
that
of
the
queens
the
bar
and
the
queen
send
this
bodyguard
with
their
respective
chick
took
the
bundle
that
geos
had
brought
and
proceeded
to
don
his
own
clothes
finding
deep
satisfaction
in
the
fact
that
they
had
arrived
as
intact
as
he
he
felt
carefully
in
his
hip
pocket
the
automatic
was
still
there
likewise
the
extra
magazine
of
cartridges
that
he
had
carried
about
with
him
on
that
night
in
his
other
pockets
he
found
two
packets
of
cigarettes
a
pouch
of
tobacco
some
papers
a
few
coins
a
little
money
and
two
photographs
one
of
bertha
and
the
other
of
her
father
not
a
thing
had
been
disturbed
he
announced
himself
ready
the
rhamda
conducted
him
down
the
corridor
which
he
found
to
be
lined
with
guards
red
on
one
side
blue
on
the
other
these
men
fell
in
behind
in
two
parallel
files
one
of
the
one
colour
and
one
of
the
other
it
was
a
building
of
great
size
the
corridors
were
long
and
high
all
with
the
ceiling
and
of
colours
that
melted
from
one
shade
to
another
as
they
turned
not
corners
but
curves
apparently
each
colour
had
its
own
suggestive
reason
such
rooms
as
chick
could
look
into
were
uniformly
large
beautiful
and
distinctly
lighted
the
guard
moved
in
silent
rhythm
the
chief
sound
was
that
made
by
watson
shoes
drowning
out
for
once
the
everlasting
tinkling
undertone
of
those
unseen
that
running
cadence
never
ceasing
silver
liquid
like
the
soul
of
sound
though
watson
walked
with
head
erect
he
had
eyes
for
every
little
thing
he
passed
he
noted
the
material
of
the
structure
and
tried
to
name
it
neither
plaster
nor
stone
the
walls
were
highly
polished
and
somehow
or
other
capable
of
emitting
perfume
light
and
wholesome
not
heavy
and
oppressive
and
in
dark
passages
the
walls
glowed
the
corridor
widened
and
with
a
graceful
curve
opened
upon
a
wide
stairway
that
descended
or
rather
sank
to
use
watson
own
words
for
the
feeling
into
the
depths
of
the
building
to
the
right
of
one
landing
was
a
large
window
reaching
to
the
floor
its
panes
were
clear
and
not
frosted
as
had
been
the
others
chick
got
his
first
glimpse
here
of
what
lay
outside
an
iridescent
landscape
at
first
view
astonishingly
like
an
ocean
of
opals
for
it
was
of
many
hues
red
and
purple
and
milky
white
splashed
violantin
blue
and
fluorescence
a
maze
and
shimmer
of
dancing
joyful
colours
whirring
in
an
uncertainty
of
polychromatic
harmony
such
was
his
first
fleeting
impression
at
the
next
landing
he
looked
closer
it
was
not
unlike
a
monster
bowl
of
bubbles
the
same
illusion
of
movement
the
same
delicacy
and
witchery
of
colour
only
here
the
sensation
was
not
that
of
decomposition
but
of
life
of
flowers
delicate
as
the
rainbow
tenuous
sinuous
breathing
weaving
in
a
serpentine
maze
of
daedalian
hues
long
tendrils
of
orchidian
beauty
lifting
weaving
drooping
a
vast
sea
of
equatorial
bloom
but
no
trees
this
is
our
landscape
spoke
the
rhamda
according
to
the
jarados
it
is
not
like
that
of
the
next
world
your
world
my
lord
after
you
meet
the
rhamdas
i
shall
take
you
into
the
mahovisal
for
a
closer
view
of
it
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairway
chick
noted
the
architecture
in
the
at
this
point
the
seeming
solidness
of
structure
as
if
the
whole
had
been
chiselled
not
built
the
vestibule
was
really
a
hall
domed
and
high
large
enough
to
shelter
a
hundred
like
the
corridor
outside
chick
room
it
was
lined
with
a
row
each
of
red
and
blue
uniformed
guards
invariably
the
one
belonged
to
the
blond
lithe
type
the
others
heavy
sturdy
formidable
the
extremities
of
the
two
lines
converged
on
an
doorway
very
large
having
above
it
a
design
conventionalised
from
the
clover
one
leaf
was
scarlet
one
blue
the
other
green
the
door
opened
the
guards
halted
geos
stepped
aside
with
a
bow
and
watson
strode
forward
into
the
presence
of
the
council
of
the
rhamdas
xxxiv
the
bar
senestro
it
was
a
critical
moment
for
chick
out
of
the
impulse
of
his
inner
nature
he
had
chosen
the
odds
that
he
must
now
uphold
against
the
combined
wisdom
of
these
intellectuals
he
was
alone
with
no
one
to
guide
him
save
geos
who
undoubtedly
was
his
friend
but
who
as
undoubtedly
would
desert
him
upon
the
slightest
inkling
of
imposture
he
found
himself
in
a
great
round
room
or
rather
an
oval
one
domed
at
the
top
but
tinted
in
a
far
more
beautiful
colouring
lazuli
blue
the
walls
were
cut
by
long
narrow
windows
reaching
far
up
into
the
sweep
where
the
side
melted
into
the
ceiling
the
material
of
the
windows
was
of
the
same
translucent
substance
already
noted
but
slightly
tinged
with
green
so
that
they
shed
a
soft
light
cooled
and
quiet
over
the
whole
assembly
on
the
wall
opposite
the
doorway
was
a
large
replica
of
the
design
outside
even
more
in
brilliance
its
three
colours
woven
into
a
trinity
almost
of
flame
whether
the
light
was
artificial
or
intrinsic
chick
could
not
say
the
floor
of
the
place
accommodated
some
three
hundred
tables
of
the
library
type
and
the
same
number
of
men
bearing
the
distinguished
stamp
of
the
rhamda
all
were
comparatively
tall
and
possessing
the
same
aesthetic
manner
which
impressed
one
with
the
notion
of
inherited
inherent
culture
the
entire
hall
had
the
atmosphere
of
learning
justice
and
the
supreme
tribunal
for
a
moment
watson
felt
weak
and
uncertain
he
could
hold
up
against
geos
and
avec
but
in
the
face
of
such
an
array
he
was
so
sure
there
was
but
one
thing
to
encourage
him
the
faces
into
which
he
looked
all
were
full
of
wonder
and
reverence
then
he
looked
about
him
more
carefully
he
had
come
out
upon
a
wide
platform
or
rostrum
he
now
noticed
that
he
was
flanked
on
either
side
by
thrones
two
of
them
they
seemed
made
of
golden
amber
the
one
on
the
right
was
occupied
by
a
man
the
other
by
a
woman
in
the
pause
that
was
vouchsafed
him
chick
took
note
of
these
two
and
wondered
in
the
first
place
the
man
was
not
a
rhamda
the
jewelled
that
he
wore
was
more
significant
than
the
dignified
garb
of
the
intellectuals
at
the
same
time
his
accoutrements
cheapened
him
by
contrast
he
was
executive
princely
with
the
bearing
that
comes
of
worldly
ambitions
and
attainments
a
man
strangely
handsome
vital
athletic
curling
hair
dark
quick
eyes
and
even
features
except
only
for
the
mouth
he
might
have
been
taken
as
a
model
of
the
greek
alexander
the
clothes
he
wore
were
classic
as
was
everything
else
about
him
even
to
his
sandals
his
bare
arms
and
his
jewelled
breastplate
watson
had
studied
history
he
had
a
quick
impression
of
a
composite
of
genius
cruelty
and
sensuality
here
was
one
with
three
strong
natures
a
sort
of
nero
caligula
and
alexander
combined
the
sensuality
of
the
first
the
cruelty
of
the
second
and
the
instinctive
fire
and
greatness
of
the
immortal
macedonian
the
man
was
smiling
not
an
amused
smile
but
one
of
interest
humorous
tolerance
when
their
eyes
met
chick
caught
the
magnetic
current
of
personality
the
same
sense
of
illusiveness
that
he
and
harry
wendel
had
noted
in
the
nervina
only
here
it
was
negative
resisting
instead
of
aiding
a
number
of
the
blue
guard
surrounded
the
throne
their
faces
dark
strong
and
of
unconquerable
resolution
though
slow
to
think
on
the
other
throne
was
a
girl
chick
had
heard
enough
from
the
geos
to
guess
her
identity
one
of
the
queens
the
aradna
frail
delicate
a
maiden
with
a
waving
mass
of
hair
hanging
loosely
about
her
shoulders
she
too
was
classically
attired
although
there
were
touches
of
modernity
here
and
there
in
the
arrangement
of
ribbons
the
garment
matched
her
guards
crimson
and
was
draped
about
her
shoulders
so
as
to
leave
one
bare
together
with
that
arm
across
her
forehead
was
a
band
of
gems
and
she
wore
no
other
jewels
she
was
not
more
than
seventeen
or
eighteen
with
eyes
like
bluebells
lips
as
red
as
poppies
features
that
danced
with
delight
and
laughter
and
all
the
innocence
that
one
would
associate
with
elfin
royalty
instinctively
chick
compared
her
with
the
nervina
the
senior
queen
had
the
subtle
magnetism
the
uncountable
fascination
the
poise
and
decision
that
held
and
dictated
all
things
to
her
fancy
not
so
the
aradna
hers
was
the
strength
of
simplicity
the
frank
open
delight
of
the
maiden
and
at
the
same
time
all
the
charm
and
suggestion
of
coming
womanhood
when
she
caught
watson
eye
she
smiled
a
smile
free
and
unrestrained
out
of
an
open
happy
heart
she
made
a
remark
to
one
of
her
guards
who
nodded
a
reply
after
the
manner
of
a
friend
rather
than
a
courtier
watson
turned
to
the
geos
who
stood
somewhat
to
one
side
and
a
little
to
the
rear
the
aradna
yes
the
queen
of
the
man
on
the
other
side
is
the
bar
whatever
feeling
chick
entertained
for
the
one
was
offset
by
what
he
felt
for
the
other
he
was
between
two
forces
his
instinct
warned
him
of
the
bar
sceptical
powerful
ruthless
a
man
to
be
reckoned
with
but
his
better
nature
went
out
to
the
young
queen
at
a
motion
from
geos
the
whole
assembly
of
rhamdas
stood
up
the
action
was
both
dignified
and
reverent
though
chick
was
in
their
eyes
a
miracle
there
was
no
unseemly
staring
nor
jarring
of
curiosity
all
was
quietness
ease
poise
the
only
sound
was
that
of
the
constant
subtle
music
of
those
invisible
bells
rhamda
geos
began
speaking
at
the
same
time
he
placed
a
friendly
hand
on
watson
shoulder
a
signal
for
every
other
rhamda
to
resume
his
seat
the
fact
and
the
substance
my
geos
paused
as
he
made
use
of
the
phrase
and
then
in
a
few
rapid
sentences
he
ran
over
the
synopsis
of
that
affair
beginning
with
some
philosophy
and
other
details
that
watson
could
only
half
understand
making
frequent
allusions
to
the
jarados
and
other
writers
of
prophecy
then
he
made
some
mention
of
his
own
particular
brand
of
spiritism
and
its
stand
on
materialisation
this
he
followed
with
an
account
of
the
finding
of
watson
in
the
temple
his
long
sleep
and
ultimate
reviving
at
greater
length
he
repeated
the
gist
of
their
conversation
not
until
then
was
there
a
stir
among
the
rhamdas
chick
glanced
over
at
the
aradna
she
was
listening
eagerly
her
chin
cupped
in
her
hand
her
blue
eyes
full
of
interest
and
wonder
and
natural
unfeigned
delight
then
the
bar
caught
chick
glance
the
newcomer
felt
the
cold
chill
of
calculation
the
cynical
weight
of
the
sceptic
and
a
queer
foreboding
of
the
future
no
light
glance
but
one
like
fire
and
ice
and
iron
he
wondered
at
the
man
beauty
and
genius
and
at
his
emotional
preponderance
manifest
even
here
before
the
rhamdas
the
geos
went
on
his
words
now
were
simple
and
direct
watson
felt
himself
almost
deified
by
that
reverent
manner
the
rhamdas
listened
with
visibly
growing
interest
the
aradna
leaned
slightly
forward
even
the
bar
dropped
his
interest
in
watson
to
pay
closer
attention
to
the
speaker
for
geos
had
come
to
the
jarados
he
was
an
orator
as
well
as
a
mystic
and
he
was
advancing
chick
words
with
all
the
skill
of
a
master
of
language
ascending
effect
climax
the
jarados
had
come
among
them
and
they
had
missed
him
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
a
rustle
of
general
comment
chick
watched
the
rhamdas
leaning
over
to
whisper
to
each
other
could
he
stand
up
against
them
but
none
of
them
spoke
after
the
first
murmur
of
comment
they
lapsed
into
silence
again
it
was
the
bar
senestro
who
broke
the
tension
may
i
ask
rhamda
geos
why
you
make
such
an
assertion
what
proof
have
you
to
begin
with
that
this
man
indicating
watson
with
a
nod
is
not
merely
one
of
ourselves
a
or
a
kospian
the
geos
replied
instantly
you
know
the
manner
of
his
discovery
bar
senestro
have
you
not
eyes
geos
seemed
to
think
he
had
said
the
last
word
surely
rejoined
the
bar
i
have
very
good
eyes
rhamda
geos
likewise
i
have
a
mind
to
reason
with
but
my
imagination
i
fear
is
defective
what
i
behold
is
just
such
a
creature
as
myself
not
otherwise
how
hold
you
that
this
one
is
proof
out
of
the
occult
you
are
sceptical
returned
the
rhamda
evenly
even
as
you
behold
him
you
are
full
of
doubt
but
do
you
not
recall
the
words
of
the
great
avec
do
you
not
know
the
prophecy
of
the
jarados
truly
geos
i
remember
them
both
especially
the
writing
on
the
wall
of
the
temple
does
not
the
prophet
himself
say
behold
in
the
last
days
there
shall
come
among
ye
the
false
ones
them
ye
shall
slay
all
very
true
bar
senestro
but
you
well
know
we
all
know
that
the
true
prophecy
was
to
be
fulfilled
when
the
spot
was
opened
did
not
the
fulfilment
begin
when
the
avec
and
the
nervina
passed
through
to
the
other
side
the
fulfilment
geos
perhaps
it
was
the
sign
of
the
coming
of
impostors
the
end
may
not
be
until
all
the
conditions
are
complied
with
but
at
this
moment
aradna
saw
fit
to
speak
senestro
would
you
condemn
this
one
without
allowing
him
a
word
in
his
own
defence
is
it
fair
besides
he
does
not
look
like
an
impostor
to
me
i
like
his
face
perhaps
he
is
one
of
the
chosen
at
the
last
word
the
bar
frowned
his
glance
shifted
suddenly
to
watson
a
swift
look
of
calculation
very
very
true
o
aradna
i
too
would
have
him
speak
in
his
own
behalf
let
him
amuse
us
with
his
tongue
what
would
your
majesty
care
to
hear
o
aradna
from
this
phantom
the
words
were
of
biting
satire
chick
wheeled
upon
the
bar
their
eyes
clashed
an
encounter
not
altogether
to
watson
credit
he
was
a
bit
unsteady
a
trifle
uncertain
of
his
power
he
had
calculated
on
the
superstition
of
the
rhamdas
to
hold
him
up
until
he
caught
his
footing
and
this
unexpected
scepticism
was
disconcerting
however
he
was
no
coward
the
feeling
passed
away
almost
at
once
he
strode
straight
up
to
the
throne
of
the
bar
and
once
more
he
spoke
from
sheer
impulse
the
aradna
has
spoken
true
o
senestro
or
sinister
or
whatever
you
may
be
called
i
demand
fair
hearing
it
is
my
due
for
i
have
come
from
another
world
i
follow
the
jarados
if
watson
had
supposed
that
he
had
taken
the
bar
measure
he
was
mistaken
the
prince
eyes
suddenly
glinted
with
a
fierce
pleasure
like
a
flash
his
antagonism
shifted
to
something
astonishingly
like
admiration
well
spoken
incidentally
you
are
well
made
and
sound
looking
passably
replied
watson
i
do
not
care
to
discuss
my
appearance
however
i
am
certainly
no
more
than
some
and
impertinent
continued
the
other
quite
without
malice
do
you
know
anything
about
the
bar
to
whom
you
speak
so
saucily
i
know
that
you
have
intimated
that
i
may
be
an
impostor
you
have
done
this
after
hearing
what
the
learned
rhamda
geos
has
said
you
know
the
facts
you
know
that
i
have
come
from
the
jarados
i
but
it
was
watson
words
that
held
the
bar
attention
straight
form
his
actions
overbalanced
the
question
of
the
prophet
in
the
mind
of
the
man
on
the
throne
his
delight
was
truly
you
are
soundly
built
stranger
you
are
made
of
iron
and
whipcord
finely
formed
quick
and
he
threw
a
word
to
one
of
his
attendants
then
suddenly
stood
up
and
descended
from
his
throne
he
came
up
and
stood
beside
watson
chick
straightened
the
prince
was
an
inch
the
taller
his
bare
arms
lithe
powerful
under
the
pink
skin
chick
could
see
the
delicate
play
of
strength
and
vitality
he
sensed
the
strength
of
the
man
his
quick
eager
instinctive
glance
his
step
and
certainty
of
graceful
movement
stranger
spoke
the
bar
indeed
you
are
an
athlete
what
is
your
nationality
kospian
neither
kospian
nor
i
am
an
american
true
there
are
some
who
have
said
that
i
am
built
like
a
man
i
pride
myself
that
i
can
conduct
myself
like
and
speak
still
in
the
best
of
humour
the
prince
coolly
reached
out
and
felt
watson
biceps
his
eyes
became
still
brighter
if
not
an
admirer
of
decorum
he
could
appreciate
firm
flesh
sirra
you
are
strong
answer
me
do
you
know
anything
about
games
of
violence
several
anything
you
but
the
prince
shook
his
head
not
so
i
claim
no
unfair
advantage
you
are
well
met
and
opportune
let
it
be
a
contest
of
your
own
choosing
the
greater
honour
to
myself
the
victor
but
the
little
queen
saw
fit
to
interfere
senestro
is
this
the
code
of
the
bar
is
not
your
proposal
unseemly
to
so
great
a
guest
restrain
your
eagerness
for
strength
and
for
muscle
you
have
preferred
charges
against
this
man
now
you
would
hurl
your
body
as
well
remember
i
am
the
queen
i
can
command
it
of
the
senestro
bowed
your
wishes
are
my
law
o
then
turning
to
watson
i
am
stranger
you
are
the
man
i
have
seen
for
many
a
circle
but
i
shall
best
he
paced
to
his
throne
and
resumed
his
seat
let
him
tell
us
his
tale
i
repeat
geos
that
for
all
his
beauty
this
one
is
an
impostor
when
he
has
spoken
i
shall
confute
him
i
ask
only
that
in
the
end
he
be
turned
over
to
it
was
plain
that
the
thomahlia
was
blest
with
odd
rulers
if
the
bar
senestro
was
a
priest
he
was
clearly
still
more
of
a
soldier
the
fiery
challenge
of
the
man
struck
an
answering
chord
in
watson
he
knew
the
time
must
come
when
he
should
weigh
himself
up
against
this
alexander
and
it
was
anything
but
displeasing
to
him
what
must
i
say
and
do
he
asked
the
rhamda
geos
what
do
they
want
me
to
tell
them
just
what
you
have
told
me
tell
them
of
the
nervina
and
of
the
rhamda
avec
the
prince
is
a
man
of
the
world
but
from
the
rhamdas
you
will
have
whereat
chick
addressed
the
intellectuals
they
seemed
accustomed
to
the
outbursts
of
the
handsome
bar
and
were
now
waiting
complacently
in
a
few
words
watson
described
the
nervina
and
avec
their
appearance
manners
everything
fortunately
he
did
not
have
to
dissemble
when
he
had
finished
there
was
a
faint
murmur
of
approval
it
is
proven
declared
the
girl
queen
it
is
truly
my
cousin
the
nervina
i
knew
not
the
rhamda
but
from
your
faces
it
must
have
been
he
senestro
what
say
you
to
this
but
the
bar
was
totally
unconvinced
all
this
is
childish
did
i
not
say
he
is
of
our
world
or
kospian
or
some
other
does
not
all
thomahlia
know
of
the
nervina
few
have
seen
the
rhamda
avec
but
what
of
it
some
have
what
this
stranger
says
proves
nothing
at
all
i
say
give
him
a
the
test
from
geos
in
a
hushed
tone
just
that
there
is
none
who
knows
the
likeness
of
the
jarados
none
but
the
absent
avec
none
among
us
has
ever
seen
his
image
it
is
a
secret
to
all
save
the
high
rhamda
yet
in
cases
like
this
well
may
the
leaf
be
watson
wondering
what
was
meant
listened
closely
to
the
prince
as
he
continued
it
is
written
that
there
are
times
when
all
may
see
surely
this
is
such
a
time
now
let
this
stranger
describe
the
jarados
he
says
that
he
had
seen
him
that
he
is
the
prophet
prospective
good
let
him
describe
the
jarados
to
us
then
open
the
leaf
if
he
speaks
true
we
shall
know
him
to
be
from
the
jarados
if
he
fail
then
i
shall
claim
him
for
purposes
of
my
whatever
the
motives
of
the
senestro
he
surely
had
the
genius
of
quick
decision
watson
knew
that
the
moment
had
come
to
test
his
luck
to
the
uttermost
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
he
did
it
he
said
to
the
rhamda
geos
in
a
tone
of
the
utmost
indifference
i
am
geos
was
distinctively
relieved
it
is
good
my
lord
tell
us
in
simple
words
describe
the
jarados
just
as
you
have
seen
him
just
as
you
would
have
us
see
him
afterwards
we
shall
open
the
and
in
a
lower
tone
if
you
speak
accurately
i
shall
be
vindicated
my
lord
i
doubt
not
that
you
are
a
better
man
than
the
prince
but
place
your
reliance
in
the
truth
it
will
be
one
more
proof
of
the
occult
and
of
the
day
which
is
all
that
watson
told
but
first
he
breathed
a
prayer
to
one
who
is
above
all
things
occult
or
physical
he
did
not
understand
where
he
was
nor
how
he
had
got
there
he
only
knew
that
his
fate
was
hanging
on
a
toss
of
chance
he
faced
the
rhamdas
without
flinching
and
half
closing
his
eyes
and
speaking
very
clearly
he
searched
his
memory
for
what
he
recalled
of
the
old
professor
he
tried
to
describe
him
just
as
he
had
appeared
that
day
in
the
ethics
class
when
he
made
the
great
announcement
the
trim
stubby
figure
of
professor
holcomb
the
pink
healthy
skin
the
wise
grey
kindly
eyes
and
the
pure
white
beard
all
just
as
chick
had
known
him
one
chance
in
millions
he
took
it
that
is
the
jarados
as
i
have
seen
him
a
short
elderly
wise
bearded
there
was
not
a
breath
or
a
murmur
in
comment
all
hung
upon
his
words
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
room
as
he
ceased
speaking
only
the
throb
of
his
own
heart
and
the
subtle
pounding
of
caution
in
his
veins
he
had
spoken
if
only
there
might
be
a
resemblance
the
geos
stepped
forward
a
pace
it
is
well
said
if
the
truth
has
been
spoken
there
shall
be
room
for
no
dispute
it
shall
be
known
throughout
all
thomahlia
that
the
chosen
of
the
jarados
has
spoken
let
the
leaf
be
opened
chick
never
knew
just
what
happened
much
less
how
it
was
accomplished
he
knew
only
that
a
black
opaque
wave
ran
up
the
long
windows
shutting
off
the
light
so
that
instantly
the
darkness
of
night
enveloped
everything
blotting
out
all
that
maze
of
colour
it
was
the
blackness
of
the
void
then
came
a
tiny
light
a
mere
dot
of
flame
over
on
the
opposite
wall
a
of
light
it
was
seemingly
coming
out
of
a
vast
distance
like
an
approaching
star
growing
gradually
larger
spreading
out
into
a
screen
of
radiance
that
presently
was
flashing
with
intrinsic
life
the
corruscation
grew
brighter
little
tufts
of
brilliance
shot
out
with
all
the
stabbing
suddenness
of
shooting
stars
to
chick
it
was
exactly
as
though
some
god
were
pushing
his
way
through
and
out
of
fire
in
the
end
the
flame
burst
asunder
diminished
into
a
receding
circle
and
sputtered
out
and
in
the
place
of
the
strange
light
there
appeared
the
illuminated
figure
of
a
man
leaning
forward
chick
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
again
it
was
the
bust
of
professor
holcomb
xxxv
the
perfect
impostor
chick
gasped
of
all
that
assemblage
rhamdas
guards
the
occupants
of
the
two
thrones
he
himself
was
the
most
astounded
was
the
great
professor
in
actual
fact
the
true
jarados
if
not
how
explain
this
miracle
but
if
he
were
how
to
explain
the
duality
the
identity
surely
it
could
not
be
sheer
chance
fortunately
for
chick
it
was
dark
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
trim
figure
which
occupied
the
space
of
the
on
the
rear
wall
except
for
chick
strangled
gasp
there
was
only
the
hushed
silence
of
reverence
deep
and
impressive
then
another
dot
appeared
from
its
position
watson
took
it
to
come
from
another
leaf
of
the
clover
another
light
approaching
out
of
the
void
and
cutting
through
the
blackness
exactly
as
the
first
had
come
it
grew
and
spread
until
it
had
filled
the
whole
leaf
then
again
the
bursting
of
the
flare
the
diminishing
of
the
light
and
its
disappearance
in
a
thin
rim
at
the
edge
and
this
time
there
was
revealed
a
handsome
dog
watson
of
course
could
not
understand
the
silence
held
he
could
feel
the
rhamda
geos
at
his
side
and
hear
him
murmur
something
which
in
itself
was
quite
unintelligible
the
one
the
call
to
humility
sacrifice
and
unselfishness
the
one
that
was
all
it
was
a
shaggy
shepherd
dog
with
a
pointed
nose
and
one
ear
cocked
up
and
the
other
down
very
wisely
inquisitive
chick
had
seen
similar
dogs
many
times
but
he
could
not
account
for
this
one
certainly
not
in
such
a
place
what
had
it
to
do
with
the
jarados
still
the
darkness
it
gave
him
a
chance
to
think
he
wondered
rapidly
how
he
could
link
up
such
a
creature
with
his
description
of
the
jarados
what
could
be
the
purpose
of
a
canine
in
occult
philosophy
or
was
the
whole
thing
after
all
mere
blundering
chance
this
is
what
bothered
chick
he
did
not
know
how
to
adjust
himself
life
place
sequence
were
all
out
of
order
until
he
could
gather
exact
data
he
must
trust
to
intuition
as
before
the
two
pictures
vanished
simultaneously
down
came
the
black
waves
from
the
windows
gradually
and
in
a
moment
the
room
was
once
more
flooded
with
that
mellow
radiance
the
rhamda
geos
stepped
forward
as
a
murmur
of
awed
approval
arose
from
the
assembly
there
was
no
applause
one
does
not
applaud
the
miraculous
the
geos
took
his
hand
it
is
proven
he
declared
then
to
the
rhamdas
is
there
any
question
my
brothers
but
no
word
came
from
the
floor
seemingly
superstition
had
triumphed
over
all
else
the
men
of
learning
turned
none
but
reverent
faces
toward
watson
he
forebore
to
glance
at
the
bar
senestro
despite
the
triumph
he
was
apprehensive
of
the
princes
keen
genius
an
agnostic
is
seldom
converted
by
what
could
be
explained
away
as
mere
coincidence
moreover
as
it
ultimately
appeared
the
bar
now
had
more
than
one
reason
for
antagonising
the
man
who
claimed
to
be
the
professor
prospective
is
there
any
question
repeated
rhamda
geos
but
to
the
surprise
of
chick
it
came
from
the
queen
she
was
standing
before
her
throne
now
around
her
waist
a
girdle
of
satin
revealed
the
tender
frailty
of
her
figure
she
gave
watson
a
close
scrutiny
and
then
addressed
the
geos
i
want
to
put
one
question
rhamda
the
stranger
seems
to
be
a
goodly
young
man
he
has
come
from
the
jarados
tell
me
is
he
truly
of
the
chosen
but
a
clear
derisive
laugh
from
the
opposite
throne
interrupted
the
answer
the
bar
stood
up
his
black
eyes
dancing
with
mocking
laughter
the
chosen
o
aradna
the
chosen
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
tricked
by
a
little
thing
i
myself
have
been
chosen
by
the
inherited
law
of
the
thomahlia
then
to
chick
i
see
sir
phantom
that
our
futures
are
to
be
intertwined
with
interest
i
do
know
what
you
no
very
good
if
you
are
really
come
out
of
superstition
then
i
shall
teach
you
the
value
of
materiality
you
are
well
made
and
handsome
likewise
courageous
may
the
time
soon
come
when
you
can
put
your
mettle
to
the
test
in
a
fair
conflict
it
is
your
own
saying
o
senestro
warned
geos
you
must
abide
by
my
lord
true
and
i
shall
abide
i
know
nothing
of
black
magic
or
any
other
but
i
care
not
i
know
only
that
i
can
not
accept
this
stranger
as
a
spirit
i
have
felt
his
muscles
and
i
know
his
strength
they
are
a
man
and
a
then
you
do
not
abide
yes
i
do
that
is
i
do
not
claim
him
he
has
won
his
freedom
but
as
for
endorsing
him
no
not
until
he
has
given
further
proof
let
him
come
to
the
spot
of
life
let
him
take
the
ordeal
let
him
qualify
on
the
day
of
the
my
lord
do
you
accept
watson
had
no
idea
what
the
ordeal
might
be
nor
what
might
be
the
significance
of
the
day
but
he
could
not
very
well
refuse
he
spoke
as
lightly
as
he
could
of
course
i
accept
then
addressing
the
prince
one
word
o
speak
up
sir
phantom
bar
senestro
what
have
you
done
with
the
jarados
an
instant
stunned
silence
greeted
this
stab
it
was
broken
by
the
prince
the
jarados
his
voice
was
unruffled
what
know
i
of
the
jarados
take
care
you
have
seen
him
you
know
his
power
you
have
a
courageous
sort
of
impertinence
i
have
determination
and
knowledge
bar
senestro
i
have
come
for
the
jarados
chick
paused
for
effect
now
what
think
you
am
i
of
the
chosen
he
had
meant
it
as
a
deliberate
taunt
and
so
it
was
taken
the
bar
shot
to
his
feet
not
that
he
was
angered
his
straight
handsome
form
was
kingly
and
for
all
his
impulsiveness
there
was
a
certain
real
majesty
about
his
every
pose
you
are
of
the
chosen
it
is
well
you
have
given
spice
to
the
taunt
i
would
not
have
it
otherwise
forget
not
your
courage
on
the
day
of
the
prophet
with
that
he
stepped
gracefully
superbly
from
the
dais
beneath
his
throne
he
bowed
to
the
aradna
to
geos
to
chick
and
to
the
assembly
and
was
gone
the
blue
guard
followed
in
silence
the
rest
of
the
ordeal
was
soon
done
nothing
more
was
said
about
the
jarados
nor
of
what
the
bar
senestro
had
brought
up
there
were
a
few
questions
about
the
world
he
had
quit
questions
which
put
no
strain
upon
his
imagination
to
answer
he
was
out
of
the
deep
water
for
the
present
when
the
assembly
dissolved
chick
was
conducted
back
to
the
apartments
upstairs
not
to
his
old
room
however
but
to
an
adjoining
suite
a
magnificent
place
that
would
have
done
honour
to
a
prince
but
chick
scarcely
noted
the
beauty
of
the
place
his
attention
flew
at
once
to
something
for
which
he
longed
an
immense
globe
chick
spun
it
around
eagerly
upon
its
axis
the
first
thing
that
he
looked
for
was
san
francisco
or
rather
north
america
if
he
was
on
the
earth
he
wanted
to
know
it
surely
the
oceans
and
continents
would
not
change
but
he
was
doomed
to
disappointment
there
was
not
a
familiar
detail
outside
of
a
network
of
curved
lines
indicating
latitude
and
longitude
and
the
accustomed
tilt
of
the
polar
axis
the
globe
was
totally
strange
so
strange
that
chick
could
not
decide
which
was
water
and
which
land
after
a
bit
of
puzzling
chick
ran
across
a
yellow
patch
marked
with
some
strange
characters
which
upon
examination
were
translated
in
some
unknown
manner
within
his
subconscious
mind
to
another
was
lettered
assuming
that
these
were
land
and
there
were
a
few
other
smaller
ones
of
the
same
shade
then
the
land
area
covered
approximately
of
the
globe
inferentially
the
green
remainder
or
was
the
water
or
ocean
covered
area
such
a
proportion
was
nearly
the
precise
reverse
of
that
obtaining
on
the
earth
chick
puzzled
over
other
strange
names
mal
somnal
bloudou
san
and
the
like
not
one
name
or
outline
that
he
could
place
how
could
he
make
his
discovery
fit
with
the
words
of
holcomb
and
with
what
philosophy
he
knew
somehow
there
was
too
much
life
too
much
reality
to
fit
in
with
any
spiritistic
hypothesis
he
was
surrounded
by
real
matter
atomic
molecular
cellular
he
was
certain
that
if
he
were
put
to
it
he
could
prove
right
here
every
law
from
those
put
forth
by
newton
to
the
present
it
was
still
the
material
universe
that
was
certain
therefor
it
was
equally
certain
that
the
doctor
had
made
a
most
prodigious
discovery
but
what
was
it
what
was
the
law
that
had
fallen
out
of
the
blind
spot
he
gave
it
up
and
stepped
to
one
of
the
suite
numerous
windows
they
were
all
provided
with
clear
glass
now
was
his
opportunity
for
an
uninterrupted
leisurely
survey
of
the
world
about
him
as
before
he
noted
the
maze
of
splendid
dazzling
opalescence
all
the
colours
of
the
spectrum
blending
weaving
vibrant
like
a
vast
plain
of
smooth
gargantuan
jewels
then
he
made
out
innumerable
round
domes
spread
out
in
rows
and
in
curves
without
seeming
order
or
system
buildings
every
roof
a
perfect
gleaming
dome
its
surface
fairly
alive
with
the
reflected
light
of
that
amazing
sun
of
such
was
the
landscape
made
as
before
he
could
hear
the
incessant
undertone
of
vague
music
of
rhythmical
shimmering
and
whispering
sound
and
the
whole
air
was
laden
with
the
hint
of
sweet
scents
tinged
with
the
perfume
of
attar
and
myrrh
of
a
most
delicate
ambrosia
he
opened
the
window
for
a
moment
he
stood
still
the
air
bathing
his
face
the
unknown
fragrance
filling
his
nostrils
the
whole
world
seemed
thrumming
with
that
hitherto
faint
quiver
of
sound
now
it
was
resonant
and
strong
though
still
only
an
undertone
he
looked
below
him
as
he
did
so
something
dropped
from
the
side
of
the
window
opening
a
long
delicate
tendril
sinuous
and
alive
it
touched
his
face
and
then
it
drooped
drooped
like
a
wounded
thing
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
plucked
it
wondering
and
he
found
at
its
tip
a
floating
crimson
blossom
as
delicate
as
the
frailest
cobweb
so
inconceivably
delicate
that
it
wilted
and
crumbled
at
the
slightest
touch
chick
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
window
the
whole
building
from
ground
to
dome
was
covered
waving
moving
tenuous
a
maze
of
colour
with
orchids
he
had
never
dreamed
of
anything
so
beautiful
or
so
splendid
everywhere
these
orchids
to
give
them
the
name
nearest
to
the
unknown
one
as
far
as
he
could
see
living
beauty
and
then
he
noticed
something
stranger
still
from
the
petals
and
the
foliage
about
him
little
clouds
of
colour
wafted
up
like
mists
of
perfume
forever
rising
and
intermittently
settling
it
was
mysteriously
harmonious
continuous
like
life
itself
chick
looked
closer
and
listened
and
then
he
knew
these
mists
were
clouds
of
tiny
insects
he
looked
down
farther
into
the
streets
they
were
teeming
with
life
with
motion
he
was
in
a
city
whose
size
made
it
a
true
metropolis
all
the
buildings
were
large
and
although
of
unfamiliar
architecture
undeniably
of
a
refined
advanced
art
without
exception
their
roofs
were
domed
hence
the
effect
of
a
sea
of
bubbles
directly
below
straight
down
from
his
window
was
a
very
broad
street
from
it
at
varying
angles
ran
a
number
of
intersecting
avenues
the
height
of
his
window
was
great
he
looked
very
closely
and
made
out
two
lines
of
colour
lining
and
outlining
the
street
surrounding
the
apartments
on
the
one
side
the
line
was
blue
on
the
other
crimson
they
were
guards
and
where
the
various
avenues
intersected
cables
must
have
been
stretched
for
these
streets
were
packed
and
jammed
with
a
surging
multitude
which
the
guards
seemed
engaged
in
holding
back
as
far
up
the
avenues
as
chick
could
see
the
seething
mass
of
fellow
creatures
extended
a
gently
pulsing
potential
commotion
as
he
looked
one
of
the
packed
streets
broke
into
confusion
he
could
see
the
guards
wheeling
and
running
into
formation
from
behind
other
platoons
rushed
up
reinforcements
the
great
crowd
was
rolling
forward
breaking
on
the
edge
of
the
guards
like
the
surf
of
a
rolling
sea
chick
had
a
sudden
thought
were
they
not
looking
up
at
his
window
he
could
glimpse
arms
uplifted
and
hands
pointed
even
the
guards
those
held
in
reserve
looked
up
then
such
was
the
distance
the
rumble
of
the
mob
reached
his
ears
at
the
same
time
spreading
like
a
grass
fire
the
commotion
broke
out
in
another
street
to
another
and
another
until
the
air
was
filled
with
the
new
undertone
of
countless
human
tongues
chick
was
fascinated
the
thing
was
while
he
looked
and
listened
the
whole
scene
turned
to
conflict
the
voice
of
the
throng
became
ominous
the
guards
still
held
the
cables
still
beat
back
the
populace
could
they
hold
out
wondered
chick
idly
and
what
was
it
all
about
something
touched
his
shoulder
he
wheeled
one
of
the
tall
guards
was
standing
beside
him
watson
instinctively
drew
back
and
as
he
did
so
the
other
stepped
forward
touched
the
snap
and
closed
the
window
what
the
idea
i
was
just
getting
interested
the
soldier
nodded
pleasantly
respectfully
reverently
orders
from
below
my
lord
were
you
to
remain
at
that
window
it
would
take
all
the
guards
in
the
mahovisal
to
keep
back
the
why
chick
was
astonished
there
are
a
million
pilgrims
in
the
city
my
lord
who
have
waited
months
for
just
one
glimpse
of
watson
considered
this
was
a
new
and
a
dazing
aspect
of
the
affair
evidently
the
expression
on
his
face
told
the
soldier
that
some
explanation
would
not
be
amiss
the
pilgrims
are
almost
innumerable
my
lord
they
are
all
of
the
one
great
faith
they
are
my
lord
the
true
believers
the
believers
in
the
the
day
instantly
watson
recalled
senestro
use
of
the
expression
he
sensed
a
valuable
clue
he
caught
and
held
the
soldier
eye
tell
me
commanded
chick
what
is
this
day
of
which
you
speak
xxxvi
an
ally
and
solid
ground
the
soldier
replied
unhesitatingly
it
is
the
day
of
life
my
lord
others
call
it
the
of
the
sixteen
days
still
others
simply
the
day
of
the
prophet
or
when
will
it
be
soon
it
is
but
two
days
hence
and
with
the
going
down
of
the
sun
on
that
day
the
fulfilment
is
to
begin
and
the
life
is
to
come
hence
the
crowd
below
my
lord
yet
they
are
nothing
compared
with
the
crowds
that
today
are
pressing
their
way
from
all
and
kospia
towards
the
all
because
of
the
day
and
to
see
you
my
all
believers
in
the
jarados
all
truly
but
they
do
not
all
believe
in
your
lordship
there
are
many
sects
including
the
bars
that
consider
you
an
imposter
but
the
rest
perhaps
the
most
believe
you
the
herald
of
the
day
all
want
to
see
you
for
whatever
these
bars
who
are
they
the
military
priesthood
my
lord
as
priests
they
teach
a
literal
interpretation
of
the
prophecy
as
soldiers
they
maintain
their
own
aggrandisement
to
be
more
specific
my
lord
it
is
they
who
accuse
you
of
being
one
of
the
false
why
because
it
is
written
in
the
prophecy
my
lord
that
we
may
expect
impostors
and
that
we
are
to
slay
then
this
coming
contest
with
the
senestro
beginning
to
sense
the
drift
of
things
yes
my
lord
it
will
be
a
physical
contest
in
which
the
best
man
destroys
the
other
the
guard
was
a
tall
finely
made
and
truly
handsome
chap
of
perhaps
watson
liked
the
clear
blue
of
his
eyes
and
the
openness
of
his
manner
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
he
was
being
weighed
and
balanced
my
lord
is
not
afraid
not
at
all
i
was
just
thinking
when
does
this
kill
take
place
two
days
hence
my
lord
on
the
first
of
the
sixteen
sacred
and
thus
chick
found
a
staunch
friend
the
soldier
name
he
learned
was
the
jan
he
was
supreme
in
command
of
the
royal
guards
and
chick
soon
came
to
feel
that
the
man
would
as
cheerfully
lay
down
his
life
for
him
watson
as
for
the
queen
herself
all
told
chick
was
able
to
store
away
in
his
memory
a
few
very
important
facts
first
that
the
aradna
did
not
like
the
senestro
second
that
the
jan
lucar
hated
the
great
bar
because
of
the
ambition
to
wed
the
queen
and
her
cousin
the
nervina
also
because
of
his
selfish
autocratic
ways
next
that
were
the
nervina
on
hand
she
would
thwart
the
senestro
for
she
was
a
very
learned
woman
as
advanced
as
the
rhamda
avec
himself
but
that
she
was
a
queen
first
and
a
scholar
afterwards
her
motive
in
going
through
the
blind
spot
was
to
take
care
of
the
political
welfare
of
her
people
her
purposes
were
as
high
as
rhamda
avec
but
partook
of
statesmanship
rather
than
spirituality
finally
that
the
rhamdas
were
perfectly
willing
for
the
coming
contest
to
take
place
on
the
evening
of
the
day
of
the
prophet
in
the
temple
of
the
bell
and
leaf
jan
lucar
watson
felt
prompted
to
say
you
need
have
no
fear
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
ordeal
whatever
it
may
be
with
your
faith
in
me
i
can
not
fail
for
the
present
i
need
books
papers
scientific
data
moreover
i
want
to
see
the
outside
of
this
the
guardsman
bowed
the
data
is
possible
my
lord
but
as
to
leaving
the
building
i
must
consult
the
queen
and
the
rhamda
geos
but
i
said
must
watson
dared
to
say
i
must
go
out
into
your
world
see
your
cities
your
lands
rivers
mountains
before
i
do
aught
else
i
must
be
sure
the
other
bowed
again
he
was
visibly
impressed
what
you
ask
my
lord
is
full
of
danger
you
must
not
be
seen
in
the
streets
yet
untold
bloodshed
would
ensue
inevitably
to
half
the
thomahlians
you
are
sacred
and
to
the
other
half
an
impostor
i
repeat
my
lord
that
i
must
see
the
geos
and
the
another
bow
and
the
jan
disappeared
to
return
in
a
few
moments
with
the
geos
the
jan
has
told
me
my
lord
that
you
would
go
if
possible
i
want
to
see
your
i
think
it
can
be
arranged
is
your
lordship
ready
to
go
watson
laid
a
hand
on
the
big
globe
he
had
already
puzzled
over
this
represents
the
thomahlia
yes
my
how
long
is
your
day
geos
i
mean
how
many
revolutions
in
one
circuit
of
the
sun
in
one
as
he
uttered
the
question
chick
held
his
breath
it
had
suddenly
struck
him
that
he
had
touched
an
extremely
definite
point
the
answer
might
place
him
you
mean
my
lord
how
long
is
a
circle
in
term
of
days
yes
three
hundred
and
and
a
fraction
my
watson
was
dumbfounded
could
there
be
in
all
the
universe
another
world
with
precisely
the
same
revolution
period
but
he
could
not
afford
to
show
his
concern
he
said
tell
me
have
you
a
moon
yes
it
has
a
cycle
of
about
watson
drew
a
deep
breath
inconceivable
though
it
appeared
he
was
still
on
his
own
earth
for
a
moment
he
pondered
wondering
if
he
had
been
caught
up
in
tangle
of
could
it
be
that
instead
of
living
in
the
present
he
had
somehow
become
entangled
in
the
past
or
in
the
future
if
so
and
by
now
he
was
so
accustomed
to
the
unusual
that
he
considered
this
staggering
possibility
with
equanimity
if
the
time
coefficient
was
at
fault
then
how
to
account
for
the
picture
of
the
professor
in
that
leaf
had
they
both
been
the
victims
of
a
ghastly
cosmic
joke
there
was
but
one
way
to
find
out
come
lead
the
way
geos
let
us
take
a
look
at
your
world
xxxvii
looking
down
presently
the
three
men
were
standing
at
the
door
of
a
vast
room
one
entire
side
of
which
was
wide
open
to
the
outer
air
it
was
filled
by
a
number
of
queer
shining
objects
at
first
glance
chick
took
them
to
be
immense
beetles
the
jan
lucar
spoke
to
the
geos
we
had
best
take
the
june
bug
of
the
rhamda
watson
thought
it
best
to
say
nothing
show
nothing
the
jan
ran
up
to
one
of
the
glistening
affairs
and
without
the
slightest
noise
he
spun
it
gracefully
around
running
it
out
into
the
centre
of
the
mosaic
floor
i
presume
apologised
the
geos
that
you
have
much
finer
aircraft
in
your
aircraft
watson
was
all
eagerness
he
saw
that
the
june
bug
was
about
ten
feet
high
with
a
bunchy
buglike
body
on
closer
scrutiny
he
could
make
out
the
outlines
of
wings
folded
tight
against
the
sides
as
for
the
material
it
must
have
been
metal
to
use
a
term
which
does
not
explain
very
much
after
all
in
every
respect
the
machine
was
a
duplicate
of
some
great
insect
except
that
instead
of
legs
it
had
rollers
how
does
it
operate
watson
wanted
to
know
that
is
what
power
do
you
use
and
how
do
you
apply
it
the
jan
lucar
threw
back
a
plate
watson
looked
inside
and
saw
a
mass
of
fine
threads
softer
than
the
tips
of
rabbit
hair
all
radiating
from
a
central
grey
object
about
the
size
of
a
pea
chick
reached
out
to
touch
this
thing
with
his
finger
but
the
geos
like
a
flash
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
and
pulled
him
back
pardon
me
my
lord
he
exclaimed
but
you
must
not
touch
it
you
even
you
would
be
annihilated
then
to
the
lucar
very
whereupon
the
other
did
something
in
front
of
the
craft
touched
a
lever
perhaps
instantly
the
grey
spidery
hairs
turned
to
a
dull
red
now
you
may
touch
it
said
the
geos
but
chick
desire
had
vanished
instead
he
ventured
a
question
all
very
interesting
but
where
is
your
machinery
the
rhamda
was
slightly
amused
he
smiled
a
little
you
must
give
us
a
little
credit
my
lord
we
must
seem
backward
to
you
but
we
have
passed
beyond
reliance
upon
simple
machines
that
little
grey
pellet
is
of
course
our
motive
force
it
is
a
highly
refined
mineral
which
we
mine
in
vast
quantity
it
has
been
in
use
for
centuries
as
for
the
web
that
is
our
idea
of
a
watson
hoped
that
he
did
not
look
as
uncomprehending
as
he
felt
the
other
continued
in
aerial
locomotion
we
are
content
to
imitate
life
as
much
as
possible
we
long
ago
discarded
engines
and
propellers
and
instead
tried
to
duplicate
the
muscular
and
nervous
systems
of
the
birds
and
insects
we
fly
exactly
as
they
do
our
motive
force
is
intrinsic
in
some
respects
we
have
improved
upon
but
it
is
still
only
a
machine
to
be
sure
my
lord
only
a
machine
anything
without
the
life
principle
must
remain
the
jan
lucar
pressed
another
catch
allowing
another
plate
to
lower
and
thereby
disclose
a
glazed
door
which
opened
into
a
cosy
apartment
fitted
with
wicker
chairs
and
large
enough
for
four
persons
there
was
some
sort
of
control
gear
which
the
jan
lucar
explained
was
not
connected
directly
with
the
flying
and
steering
members
but
indirectly
through
the
membranes
of
the
system
it
was
uncannily
similar
to
the
nervous
connections
of
the
cerebellum
with
the
various
parts
of
the
anatomy
of
an
insect
does
it
travel
very
fast
we
think
so
my
lord
this
is
the
private
machine
of
the
rhamda
avec
it
is
rather
small
but
the
swiftest
machine
in
the
they
entered
the
compartment
watson
took
his
seat
beside
the
geos
while
the
soldier
sat
forward
next
to
the
control
elements
he
laid
his
hands
on
certain
levers
next
instant
the
machine
was
gliding
noiselessly
over
the
mosaic
on
to
a
short
incline
and
thence
with
ever
increasing
speed
toward
and
through
the
open
side
of
the
room
the
slides
had
all
been
thrown
back
the
compartment
was
enclosed
only
in
glass
watson
could
get
a
clear
view
and
he
was
amazed
at
the
speed
of
the
craft
before
he
could
think
they
were
out
in
and
ascending
skyward
travelling
on
a
steep
slant
there
was
no
vibration
no
mechanical
noise
scarcely
the
suggestion
of
movement
except
for
the
muffled
swish
of
the
air
were
it
not
for
the
receding
city
below
him
chick
could
have
imagined
himself
sitting
in
a
house
while
a
windstorm
tore
by
he
felt
no
change
in
temperature
or
any
other
ill
effects
the
cabin
was
fully
enclosed
and
heated
by
some
invisible
means
in
short
ideal
flight
for
instance
the
seats
were
swung
on
gimbals
so
that
no
matter
at
what
angle
the
craft
might
fly
the
passengers
would
maintain
level
positions
below
stretched
the
mahovisal
a
mighty
city
of
domes
and
plazas
and
widely
scattered
a
few
minarets
at
the
southern
end
there
was
a
vast
square
plaza
covering
thousands
of
acres
toward
it
on
two
sides
converged
scores
of
streets
they
stretched
away
from
it
like
the
ribs
of
a
giant
fan
on
the
remaining
two
sides
there
was
a
tremendously
large
building
with
a
front
opening
on
the
square
the
play
of
opal
light
on
its
roof
resembled
the
glimmer
from
a
vast
pearl
in
the
air
above
the
city
an
uncountable
number
of
very
small
objects
darted
hither
and
thither
like
sparkling
fireflies
it
was
difficult
to
realise
that
they
too
were
aircraft
to
the
west
lay
an
immense
expanse
of
silver
melting
smoothly
into
the
horizon
watson
took
it
to
be
the
thomahlian
ocean
then
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
directly
above
him
and
breathed
a
quick
exclamation
it
was
a
single
small
object
perfectly
white
dropping
out
of
the
amethyst
tiny
at
first
amost
instantly
it
assumed
a
proportion
nearly
colossal
a
great
bird
white
as
the
breast
of
the
snowdrift
swooping
with
the
grace
of
the
eagle
and
the
speed
of
the
wind
it
was
so
very
large
that
it
seemed
to
chick
that
if
all
the
other
birds
he
had
ever
known
were
gathered
together
into
one
they
would
still
be
as
the
swallow
down
down
it
came
in
a
tremendous
spiral
until
it
gracefully
alighted
in
a
splash
of
molten
colour
on
the
bosom
of
the
silver
sea
for
a
moment
it
was
lost
in
a
shower
of
water
jewels
and
then
lay
still
a
swan
upon
the
ocean
what
is
it
geos
the
kospian
limited
my
lord
one
of
our
great
airships
a
fast
one
we
consider
it
must
accommodate
a
good
many
people
about
nine
you
say
it
comes
from
kospia
how
far
away
is
that
about
six
thousand
miles
it
is
an
run
with
one
stop
just
now
the
service
is
every
fifteen
minutes
they
are
coming
of
course
for
the
day
of
the
watson
continued
to
watch
the
great
airship
noting
the
swarm
of
smaller
craft
that
came
out
from
the
mahovisal
to
greet
it
until
the
jan
lucar
suddenly
altered
the
course
they
stopped
climbing
and
struck
out
on
a
horizontal
level
it
left
the
mahovisal
behind
them
a
shimmering
spot
of
fire
beside
the
gleaming
sea
they
were
travelling
eastwards
the
landscape
below
was
level
and
unvaried
of
a
greenish
hue
and
much
like
that
of
chick
own
earth
in
the
early
a
vast
expanse
level
and
sometimes
dotted
with
opalescent
towns
and
cities
ribbons
of
silver
cut
through
the
plain
at
intervals
crookedly
lazy
and
winding
indicating
a
drainage
from
north
to
south
or
vice
versa
looking
back
to
the
west
he
could
see
the
great
golden
sun
poised
as
he
had
seen
it
that
morning
a
huge
amber
plate
on
the
rim
of
the
world
it
was
sunset
then
chick
looked
straight
ahead
far
in
the
distance
a
great
wall
loomed
skyward
to
a
terrific
height
so
vast
was
it
and
so
remote
at
first
it
had
escaped
the
eye
altogether
an
incredibly
high
range
of
mountains
glowing
with
a
faint
rose
blush
under
the
touch
of
the
setting
sun
against
the
sky
were
many
peaks
each
of
them
tipped
with
curious
and
sparkling
corruscations
as
chick
continued
to
gaze
the
rose
began
to
purple
the
jan
lucar
put
the
craft
to
another
upward
climb
so
high
were
they
now
that
the
thomahlia
below
was
totally
lost
from
view
it
was
but
a
maze
of
lurking
shadows
the
sun
was
only
a
gash
of
amber
it
was
twilight
down
on
the
ground
and
watson
watched
the
black
line
of
the
thomahlian
shadow
climb
the
purple
heights
before
him
until
only
the
highest
crests
and
the
jewelled
crags
flashed
in
the
sun
last
rays
then
one
by
one
they
flickered
out
and
all
was
darkness
still
they
ascended
watson
became
uneasy
sitting
there
in
the
night
where
are
we
going
to
the
carbon
regions
my
lord
it
is
one
of
the
sights
of
the
on
top
of
those
mountains
beyond
my
whereupon
to
chick
growing
amazement
the
geos
went
on
to
state
that
carbon
of
all
sorts
was
extremely
common
throughout
their
world
the
same
forces
that
had
formed
coal
so
generously
upon
the
earth
had
thrown
up
almost
as
lavishly
huge
quantities
of
pure
diamond
the
material
was
of
all
colours
as
diamonds
run
and
considered
of
small
value
for
every
day
purposes
they
preferred
substances
of
more
sombre
hues
they
used
it
it
seemed
to
build
houses
with
but
how
do
they
cut
it
very
easily
the
material
which
drives
this
craft
ilodium
will
cut
it
like
later
watson
understood
he
watched
as
the
craft
continued
to
climb
the
jan
lucar
was
steering
without
the
aid
of
any
outside
lights
whatever
there
being
only
a
small
light
illuminating
his
instruments
chick
presently
turned
his
gaze
outside
again
whereupon
he
got
another
jolt
he
saw
a
negative
sky
at
first
he
thought
his
eyes
the
victims
of
an
illusion
then
he
looked
closer
and
he
saw
that
it
was
true
instead
of
the
familiar
starry
points
of
light
against
a
velvet
background
the
arrangement
was
just
the
reverse
every
constellation
was
in
its
place
just
as
chick
remembered
it
from
the
earth
but
instead
of
stars
there
were
spots
upon
a
faint
grey
background
the
whole
sky
was
one
huge
milky
way
except
for
the
black
spots
and
from
it
all
there
shone
just
about
as
much
total
light
as
from
the
heavens
he
had
known
of
all
he
experienced
this
was
the
most
disturbing
it
seemed
totally
against
all
reason
for
he
knew
the
stars
to
be
great
incandescent
globes
in
space
how
explain
that
they
were
here
represented
in
reverse
their
brilliance
scattered
and
diffused
over
the
surrounding
sky
leaving
points
of
blackness
instead
afterward
he
learned
that
the
peculiar
chemical
constituency
of
the
atmosphere
was
solely
responsible
for
the
inversion
of
the
usual
order
of
things
all
of
a
sudden
the
jan
lucar
switched
the
craft
to
a
level
he
held
up
one
hand
and
pointed
look
my
lord
and
the
rhamda
look
both
men
rose
from
their
seats
the
better
to
stare
past
the
soldier
straight
ahead
where
had
been
one
of
the
corruscating
peaks
a
streak
of
blue
fire
shot
skyward
a
column
of
light
miles
high
differing
from
the
beams
of
a
searchlight
in
that
the
rays
were
wavy
serpentine
instead
of
straight
it
was
weirdly
beautiful
geos
caught
his
breath
he
leaned
forward
and
touched
the
jan
lucar
wait
he
said
in
an
awed
tone
wait
a
moment
it
has
never
come
before
but
we
can
expect
it
and
even
as
he
spoke
something
wonderful
happened
from
the
base
of
the
column
two
other
streaks
one
red
and
the
other
bright
green
cut
out
through
the
blackness
on
either
side
the
three
streams
started
from
the
same
point
they
made
a
sort
of
trident
red
green
and
blue
twisting
alive
strangely
impressive
suggestive
of
grandeur
and
omnipotence
holy
again
the
rhamda
spoke
wait
said
he
wait
they
were
barely
moving
now
watson
watched
and
wondered
the
three
streams
of
light
ran
up
and
up
as
though
they
would
pierce
the
heavens
the
eye
could
not
follow
their
ends
all
in
utter
silence
nothing
but
those
beams
of
glorified
light
their
reality
a
hint
of
power
of
life
and
wisdom
of
the
certainty
of
things
plainly
it
had
a
tremendous
significance
in
the
minds
of
the
geos
and
the
lucar
then
came
the
climax
slowly
but
somehow
inexorably
like
the
laws
of
life
itself
and
somewhere
at
a
prodigious
height
above
the
earth
the
three
outer
ends
of
the
red
and
the
green
and
the
blue
spread
out
and
flared
back
upon
themselves
and
one
another
until
their
combined
brilliance
bridged
a
great
rainbow
across
the
sky
blending
into
all
the
colours
of
the
prism
the
bow
became
for
a
moment
pregnant
with
an
overpowering
beauty
symbolical
portentous
of
something
stupendous
about
to
come
out
of
the
unknown
to
the
thomahlians
and
next
the
bow
began
to
move
to
swirl
and
to
change
in
shape
and
colour
the
three
great
rivers
of
light
billowed
and
expanded
and
rounded
into
a
new
form
then
they
burst
into
a
vast
clover
blue
and
red
and
green
and
watson
caught
the
startled
words
of
the
geos
the
sign
of
the
jarados
xxxviii
the
voice
from
the
void
even
while
that
inexplicable
heavenly
pageant
still
burned
against
the
heavens
something
else
took
place
a
thing
of
much
greater
importance
to
chick
and
it
happened
right
before
his
eyes
in
the
front
of
the
car
was
a
dial
slightly
raised
above
the
level
of
the
various
controlling
instruments
and
all
of
a
sudden
this
dial
a
small
affair
about
six
inches
across
broke
into
light
and
life
first
there
was
a
white
blaze
that
covered
the
whole
disc
then
the
whiteness
abruptly
gave
way
to
a
flood
of
colour
which
resolved
itself
into
a
perfect
miniature
of
the
cloverleaf
in
the
sky
ahead
chick
saw
however
that
the
positions
of
the
red
and
green
were
just
the
obverse
of
what
glowed
in
the
distance
and
then
he
heard
the
voice
strong
and
distinct
speaking
with
a
slight
metallic
twang
as
from
a
microphone
hidden
in
that
little
blazing
coloured
leaf
listen
ye
who
have
ears
to
listen
it
was
said
in
the
thomahlian
tongue
the
geos
breathed
the
voice
of
the
prophet
jarados
but
the
next
moment
the
unseen
speaker
began
in
another
language
clear
silver
musical
in
english
and
in
a
voice
that
chick
recognised
chick
you
have
done
well
my
boy
your
courage
and
your
intuition
may
lead
us
out
follow
the
prophecy
to
the
letter
chick
it
must
come
to
pass
exactly
as
it
is
written
do
fail
to
read
it
there
on
the
walls
of
the
temple
of
the
bell
when
you
encounter
the
bar
senestro
on
the
day
of
the
prophet
i
have
discovered
many
things
my
boy
but
i
am
not
omnipotent
your
coming
has
made
possible
my
last
hope
that
i
may
return
to
my
own
kind
and
take
with
me
the
secrets
of
life
you
have
done
right
to
trust
your
instinct
have
no
fear
yet
remember
that
if
you
if
we
make
one
false
step
we
are
lost
finally
if
you
should
succeed
in
your
contest
with
the
senestro
i
shall
send
for
you
but
if
you
fail
i
know
how
to
die
return
at
once
to
the
mahovisal
do
cross
into
the
region
of
carbon
take
care
how
you
go
back
the
bars
are
waiting
but
you
can
put
full
confidence
in
the
then
the
speaker
dropped
the
language
of
the
earth
and
used
the
thomahlian
tongue
again
it
is
i
who
speak
i
the
prophet
the
prophet
jarados
all
in
the
voice
of
holcomb
the
blazing
leaf
faded
into
blackness
and
the
talking
ceased
chick
was
glad
of
the
darkness
the
whole
thing
was
like
magic
and
too
good
to
believe
the
first
actual
words
from
the
missing
professor
each
syllable
was
frozen
into
watson
memory
the
geos
was
clutching
his
arm
did
you
understand
my
lord
we
heard
the
voice
of
the
prophet
what
did
he
say
yes
i
understand
he
used
his
own
language
my
language
and
he
said
taking
the
reins
firmly
into
his
hands
he
said
that
we
must
return
to
the
thomahlia
and
we
must
beware
of
the
there
was
no
thought
of
questioning
him
without
waiting
the
command
the
jan
lucar
began
putting
the
craft
about
watson
glanced
at
the
sky
the
great
spectacle
was
gone
and
he
demanded
of
the
soldier
how
can
we
get
back
how
do
we
find
our
way
for
there
was
no
visible
light
save
the
strange
fitful
glow
from
that
uncanny
sky
to
guide
them
no
lights
from
the
inky
carpet
of
the
thomahlia
lights
such
as
one
would
expect
for
the
benefit
of
fliers
but
the
soldier
touched
a
button
and
instantly
another
and
larger
dial
was
illumined
above
the
instruments
it
revealed
a
map
or
chart
of
a
vast
portion
of
the
thomahlia
on
the
farther
edge
there
appeared
an
area
coloured
to
represent
water
and
adjoining
this
area
was
a
square
spot
labeled
the
and
about
midway
from
this
point
to
the
near
edge
of
the
dial
a
red
dot
hung
moving
slowly
over
the
chart
the
red
dot
my
lord
indicates
our
position
explained
the
in
that
manner
we
know
at
all
times
where
we
are
located
and
which
way
we
are
flying
we
shall
arrive
in
the
mahovisal
as
he
spoke
the
craft
was
gaining
speed
and
soon
was
travelling
at
an
even
greater
rate
than
before
the
red
dot
began
to
crawl
at
an
astonishing
speed
of
course
they
had
the
benefit
of
the
pull
of
gravity
now
apparently
they
would
make
the
journey
in
a
few
minutes
but
incredible
though
the
speed
might
be
there
was
nothing
but
the
red
dot
to
show
it
the
geos
felt
like
talking
my
lord
the
sign
is
conclusive
it
is
a
marvel
such
as
only
the
prophet
could
possibly
have
produced
with
all
our
science
we
could
not
duplicate
such
splendour
only
once
before
has
the
thomahlia
seen
already
they
were
near
enough
to
the
surface
to
make
out
the
clustered
blinking
lights
of
the
towns
on
the
plain
below
ahead
of
them
queer
streamers
of
pale
rays
thrust
through
the
darkness
watson
recognised
them
as
the
beams
of
the
searchlights
and
then
and
there
he
gave
thanks
for
one
thing
at
least
in
which
the
thomahlians
had
seemingly
progressed
no
further
than
the
people
of
the
earth
coming
a
little
nearer
chick
made
out
a
number
of
bright
glittering
objects
revealed
by
these
searchlights
the
jan
lucar
said
the
bars
my
lord
they
are
waiting
and
they
will
head
us
off
if
they
the
work
of
senestro
i
suppose
i
thought
he
claimed
to
some
it
is
not
the
prince
work
my
lord
replied
the
soldier
his
and
kospian
followers
some
of
them
have
no
scruples
as
to
how
they
might
slay
the
one
as
they
think
suppose
hazarded
watson
suppose
i
were
the
false
one
both
the
geos
and
the
jan
smiled
but
the
rhamda
voice
was
very
sure
as
he
replied
if
you
were
false
my
lord
i
would
slay
you
they
were
very
near
the
mahovisal
now
below
was
the
unmistakable
opalescence
somehow
produced
by
powerful
illumination
as
intense
as
sunlight
itself
the
red
dot
was
almost
above
the
black
square
on
the
lighted
chart
and
directly
ahead
the
air
was
becoming
alive
with
the
aircraft
how
could
they
get
by
in
safety
but
chick
did
not
know
the
jan
lucar
the
soldier
said
my
lord
is
not
uneasy
of
course
not
with
unconcern
why
because
i
propose
something
daring
i
am
free
to
admit
my
lord
that
were
the
geos
and
i
alone
i
should
not
attempt
it
but
not
even
the
bars
with
magnificent
confidence
can
stand
before
us
now
we
have
had
the
proof
of
the
jarados
and
we
know
that
no
matter
what
the
odds
he
will
carry
us
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
propose
to
shoot
it
my
and
without
explaining
the
jan
asked
the
geos
are
you
agreeable
the
june
bug
will
hold
the
prophet
will
protect
surely
returned
the
rhamda
there
is
nothing
to
fear
now
for
those
who
are
in
the
company
of
the
watson
wondering
watched
the
jan
as
he
tilted
the
nose
of
the
june
bug
and
began
to
climb
at
an
all
but
perpendicular
angle
straight
into
the
heavens
mile
after
mile
in
less
than
as
many
minutes
they
hurtled
towards
the
zenith
so
that
the
lights
of
the
city
dimmed
until
only
the
searching
shafts
could
be
seen
chick
began
to
guess
what
they
were
going
to
do
that
the
jan
lucar
was
nearly
as
reckless
as
he
was
handsome
at
last
the
soldier
brought
the
craft
to
a
level
they
soared
along
horizontally
for
a
while
the
jan
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
the
red
dot
and
when
it
was
directly
above
the
black
square
he
stated
it
is
considered
a
perilous
feat
my
lord
we
are
going
to
drop
if
we
make
it
from
this
height
not
only
will
we
break
all
records
but
will
have
proved
the
june
bug
the
superior
in
this
respect
as
she
is
in
speed
it
is
our
only
chance
in
any
circumstances
but
with
the
jarados
at
our
side
we
need
not
fear
that
the
craft
will
stand
the
strain
we
shall
go
through
them
like
stone
before
they
know
it
we
shall
be
in
the
drome
in
less
than
a
from
this
height
chick
concealed
a
shudder
behind
a
fair
show
of
scepticism
a
minute
is
not
much
does
my
lord
fear
the
drop
why
should
i
i
have
in
mind
the
june
bug
she
might
be
set
afire
through
friction
in
dropping
so
quickly
through
the
watson
had
a
vivid
picture
of
a
blazing
meteorite
containing
the
charred
bodies
of
three
men
dropping
out
of
my
lord
need
not
be
concerned
with
that
the
jan
assured
him
the
shell
of
the
car
is
provided
with
a
number
of
tiny
pores
through
which
a
fluid
will
be
pumped
during
the
manoeuvre
the
temperature
may
be
raised
a
little
but
no
more
you
see
this
plug
touching
a
hitherto
unused
knob
among
the
instruments
by
pulling
that
out
the
mechanism
of
the
craft
is
automatically
adjusted
to
care
for
every
phase
of
the
descent
nothing
else
remains
to
be
done
after
removing
that
plug
save
to
watch
the
red
dot
and
prepare
to
step
out
upon
the
floor
of
our
has
the
thing
ever
been
done
before
watson
was
sparring
for
time
while
he
gathered
his
nerve
i
myself
have
seen
it
my
lord
the
june
bug
has
been
sent
up
many
times
weighted
with
ballast
the
plug
was
abstracted
by
clockwork
and
in
seconds
she
returned
through
the
open
end
of
the
drone
without
a
hitch
it
was
beautiful
i
have
always
envied
her
that
plunge
and
now
i
shall
have
the
chance
with
the
hand
of
the
jarados
as
my
guide
and
protector
chick
had
just
time
to
reflect
that
if
by
any
chance
he
got
through
with
this
he
ought
to
be
able
to
pass
any
test
conceivable
he
ought
to
be
able
to
get
away
with
anything
he
started
to
murmur
a
prayer
but
before
he
could
finish
the
jan
lucar
leaned
over
the
for
the
last
time
saw
that
the
red
dot
was
now
exactly
central
over
the
square
that
represented
the
city
and
unhesitatingly
jerked
out
the
plug
of
what
happened
next
watson
remembered
but
little
the
bottom
seemed
to
have
dropped
out
of
the
universe
he
was
conscious
of
a
crushing
blur
of
immensity
of
a
silent
thundering
within
him
then
mental
chaos
and
a
stunned
oblivion
xxxix
who
is
the
jarados
it
was
all
over
chick
opened
his
eyes
to
see
the
jan
throwing
open
the
plate
on
the
side
of
the
compartment
neither
the
soldier
nor
the
rhamda
seemed
to
have
noted
chick
daze
as
for
the
jan
his
blue
eyes
were
dancing
with
that
what
i
call
living
he
grinned
they
can
keep
on
looking
for
the
june
bug
all
night
chick
looked
out
they
were
inside
the
great
room
from
which
they
had
started
the
trip
was
over
the
plunge
had
been
made
in
safety
chick
took
a
long
breath
and
held
out
a
hand
a
man
after
my
own
heart
jan
lucar
i
foresee
that
we
may
have
great
sport
with
the
aye
my
lord
cheerfully
the
presumptuous
usurper
i
only
wish
i
could
kill
him
instead
of
you
are
not
the
only
one
commented
the
rhamda
half
of
the
rhamdas
would
cheerfully
act
as
the
chosen
one
and
so
ended
the
events
of
chick
watson
first
day
beyond
the
blind
spot
his
first
day
on
the
thomahlia
that
is
disregarding
the
previous
months
of
unconsciousness
he
had
good
reason
to
pass
a
sleepless
night
in
legitimate
worry
for
the
outcome
of
it
all
but
instead
he
slept
the
sound
sleep
of
exhaustion
awakening
the
next
morning
much
refreshed
he
reminded
himself
first
of
all
that
today
was
the
one
immediately
preceding
that
of
his
test
the
day
of
the
prophet
he
had
only
a
little
more
than
hours
to
prepare
what
was
the
best
and
wisest
proceeding
he
called
for
the
geos
he
told
him
what
data
he
wanted
the
rhamda
said
that
he
could
find
everything
in
a
library
in
that
building
and
inside
a
he
returned
with
a
pile
of
manuscripts
left
to
himself
chick
found
that
he
now
had
data
relating
to
all
the
sciences
to
religion
to
education
and
political
history
and
the
law
the
chronology
of
the
thomahlians
chick
found
dates
back
no
less
than
fifteen
thousand
years
an
abiding
civilisation
of
that
antiquity
it
need
not
be
said
presented
somewhat
different
aspects
from
what
is
known
on
the
earth
it
seemed
that
the
jarados
had
come
miraculously
that
is
he
had
come
out
of
the
unknown
through
a
channel
which
he
himself
later
termed
the
spot
of
life
he
had
taught
a
religion
of
enlightenment
embracing
intelligence
love
virtue
and
the
higher
ethics
such
as
are
inherent
in
all
great
philosophies
but
he
did
not
call
himself
a
religionist
that
was
the
queer
point
he
said
that
he
had
come
to
teach
an
advanced
philosophy
of
life
and
he
expressly
stated
that
his
teachings
were
absolute
only
to
a
limited
extent
man
must
seek
and
find
was
one
of
his
epigrams
and
if
he
find
no
more
truths
then
he
will
find
which
was
merely
a
negative
way
of
saying
that
some
of
his
philosophy
was
only
provisional
but
on
some
points
he
was
adamant
he
had
arrived
at
a
time
when
the
unthinking
thomahlians
had
all
but
exterminated
the
lower
orders
of
creation
the
jarados
sought
to
remove
the
handicap
which
the
people
had
set
upon
themselves
and
gave
them
in
the
place
of
kindness
which
they
had
forgotten
how
to
use
a
burning
desire
for
a
positive
knowledge
where
before
had
been
only
blind
faith
also
he
taught
as
a
means
to
this
end
he
taught
beauty
love
and
laughter
the
three
great
cleansers
of
humanity
and
yet
through
it
all
the
jarados
was
a
mystic
he
studied
life
after
a
manner
of
his
own
he
was
a
stickler
for
getting
down
to
the
very
heart
of
things
for
prodding
around
among
causes
until
he
found
the
cause
itself
and
thus
he
learned
the
secret
of
the
occult
for
so
he
taught
and
presently
the
jarados
was
recognized
as
an
authority
on
what
the
thomahlia
called
the
next
only
he
showed
that
death
instead
of
being
an
ushering
into
a
void
was
merely
a
translation
onto
another
plane
of
life
a
higher
plane
and
a
more
glorious
one
in
short
a
thing
to
be
desired
and
attained
not
to
be
avoided
this
put
the
spot
of
life
on
an
entirely
different
basis
no
longer
was
it
a
fearsome
thing
the
jarados
elevated
death
to
the
plane
of
motherhood
something
to
glory
in
and
chick
gathered
that
his
famous
prophecy
which
he
had
yet
to
read
where
it
hung
on
the
wall
of
the
temple
gave
every
detail
of
the
jarados
profound
convictions
and
teachings
regarding
the
mystery
of
the
next
life
and
now
comes
a
curious
thing
as
chick
read
these
details
he
became
more
and
more
conscious
of
what
shall
it
be
called
the
presence
of
someone
or
something
beside
him
above
and
all
about
him
watching
his
every
movement
he
could
not
get
away
from
the
feeling
although
it
was
broad
daylight
and
he
was
seemingly
quite
alone
in
the
room
chick
was
not
frightened
but
he
could
have
sworn
that
a
very
real
personality
was
enveloping
his
own
as
he
read
every
word
somehow
reminded
him
of
the
miraculous
sequence
of
facts
as
he
knew
them
the
unerring
accuracy
with
which
he
quite
unthinkingly
and
almost
without
volition
had
solved
problem
after
problem
although
the
chances
were
totally
against
him
he
became
more
and
more
convinced
that
he
himself
had
practically
no
control
over
his
affairs
that
he
was
in
the
hands
of
an
irresistible
fate
and
that
he
could
not
help
it
his
good
angel
was
none
other
than
the
prophet
who
almost
ninety
centuries
ago
had
lived
and
taught
upon
the
thomahlia
and
in
the
end
had
returned
to
the
unknown
but
how
could
such
a
thing
be
watson
did
not
even
know
where
he
was
small
wonder
that
again
and
again
he
felt
the
need
of
assurance
he
asked
for
the
jan
lucar
in
the
first
place
began
chick
without
preamble
you
accept
me
jan
lucar
do
you
not
absolutely
my
you
conceive
me
to
be
out
of
the
spiritual
world
and
yet
flesh
and
blood
like
yourself
of
course
with
flat
conviction
that
settled
it
watson
decided
to
find
out
something
he
had
not
had
time
to
locate
in
the
library
the
rhamda
may
have
told
you
jan
lucar
that
i
am
here
to
seek
the
jarados
now
i
suspect
the
senestro
can
you
imagine
what
he
has
done
to
the
prophet
my
lord
remonstrated
the
other
daring
as
the
bar
might
be
he
could
do
nothing
to
the
jarados
he
would
not
then
he
is
afraid
to
run
counter
to
the
prophecy
yes
my
lord
that
is
its
literal
interpretation
he
is
opposed
only
to
the
broader
version
as
held
by
such
liberals
as
the
rhamda
avec
the
bars
are
always
warning
the
people
against
the
false
and
the
senestro
is
at
their
head
mused
chick
aloud
this
brother
of
his
who
died
usually
there
are
two
such
princes
and
chiefs
yes
my
and
the
senestro
plans
to
marry
both
queens
according
to
the
custom
my
lord
and
the
jan
suddenly
snapped
erect
the
bar
will
do
exceedingly
well
if
he
succeeds
in
marrying
one
of
them
certainly
he
shall
never
have
the
aradna
not
while
i
live
and
can
fight
good
how
about
the
nervina
he
do
well
to
find
her
first
true
enough
what
would
you
say
was
his
code
of
honour
my
lord
the
senestro
actually
has
no
code
he
believes
in
nothing
he
is
so
constituted
mentally
and
morally
that
he
cares
for
and
trusts
in
none
but
himself
he
is
a
sceptic
pure
and
simple
he
cares
nothing
for
the
jarados
and
his
teachings
he
is
an
opportunist
seeking
for
power
wicked
lustful
cruel
but
a
good
sportsman
in
what
way
my
lord
did
he
allow
me
the
choice
of
combat
the
jan
laughed
but
his
handsome
face
could
not
hide
his
contempt
it
is
ever
so
with
a
champion
my
lord
he
has
never
been
defeated
in
a
matter
of
physical
prowess
it
would
be
far
more
to
his
glory
to
overcome
you
in
combat
of
your
own
selection
it
will
be
spectacular
he
knows
the
value
of
dramatic
climax
and
he
would
kill
you
in
a
moment
before
a
million
it
a
nice
way
to
die
said
watson
you
must
grant
that
i
do
know
of
any
nice
way
to
die
my
lord
but
it
is
a
good
way
of
living
to
kill
the
bar
senestro
i
would
that
i
could
have
the
how
does
it
come
that
the
rhamdas
superintellectual
as
they
are
can
consent
to
such
a
contest
is
it
not
degrading
to
their
way
of
thinking
it
smacks
of
they
do
not
look
upon
it
in
that
light
my
lord
our
civilisation
has
passed
beyond
snobbery
of
course
there
was
a
time
centuries
ago
when
we
were
taught
that
any
physical
contest
was
brutal
but
that
was
before
we
knew
you
do
believe
it
now
by
no
means
my
lord
the
most
wonderful
physical
thing
in
the
thomahlia
is
the
human
body
we
do
not
hide
it
we
admire
beauty
strength
prowess
the
live
body
is
above
all
art
it
is
the
work
of
god
himself
art
is
but
an
imitation
and
there
is
nothing
so
splendid
as
a
physical
contest
the
lightning
correlation
of
mind
and
body
it
is
a
picture
of
do
the
rhamdas
think
this
most
assuredly
a
rhamda
is
always
first
an
why
perfection
my
lord
a
perfect
mind
does
not
always
dwell
in
a
perfect
body
but
they
strive
for
it
as
much
as
possible
the
first
test
of
a
rhamda
is
his
body
after
he
passes
that
he
must
take
the
mental
mental
moral
first
the
most
rigid
perhaps
of
all
he
must
be
a
man
above
suspicion
the
honour
of
a
rhamda
must
never
be
questioned
he
must
be
upright
and
absolutely
unselfish
he
must
be
human
lovable
and
a
leader
of
men
after
that
my
lord
comes
the
intellectual
he
must
be
a
learned
man
not
exactly
your
lordship
there
are
many
very
learned
men
who
could
not
be
rhamdas
and
there
are
many
who
have
had
no
learning
at
all
who
eventually
were
admitted
the
qualifications
are
intellectual
not
educational
the
mind
is
put
to
a
rigid
test
it
is
examined
for
alertness
perception
memory
reason
emotion
and
control
there
is
no
greater
honour
in
all
the
and
they
are
all
athletes
every
one
my
lord
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
finer
body
of
men
i
myself
would
hesitate
before
entering
a
match
with
even
the
old
rhamda
how
about
the
rhamda
avec
nor
he
either
in
the
gymnasium
he
was
always
the
superior
just
as
he
topped
all
others
morally
and
did
this
explain
the
avec
physical
prowess
on
the
one
hand
and
the
fact
that
he
would
not
stoop
to
take
that
ring
by
force
on
the
other
just
one
more
thing
jan
lucar
you
have
absolutely
no
fear
that
i
may
fail
tomorrow
not
the
slightest
my
lord
you
can
not
fail
why
not
i
have
already
said
because
you
are
from
the
and
chick
facing
the
greatest
experience
of
his
life
submerged
in
a
sea
wherein
only
a
few
islands
of
fact
were
visible
had
to
be
content
with
this
his
only
friends
were
those
who
were
firmly
convinced
of
something
which
he
knew
only
too
well
was
a
flat
fraud
all
this
backing
was
based
upon
a
misled
faith
no
not
quite
was
there
not
that
strange
feeling
that
the
jarados
himself
was
at
his
back
and
had
he
not
found
that
the
prophet
had
been
real
did
he
not
feel
as
positively
as
he
felt
anything
that
the
jarados
was
still
a
reality
chick
went
to
bed
that
night
with
a
light
heart
xl
the
temple
of
the
bell
it
was
hard
for
chick
to
remember
all
the
details
of
that
great
day
throughout
all
the
morning
and
afternoon
he
remained
in
his
apartments
breakfast
over
the
rhamdas
told
him
his
part
in
certain
ceremonies
such
as
need
not
be
detailed
here
they
were
very
solicitous
as
to
his
food
and
comfort
and
as
to
his
feelings
and
anticipations
his
nonchalance
pleased
them
greatly
afterward
he
had
a
bath
and
a
combat
to
the
death
was
it
to
be
suits
me
thought
watson
he
was
never
in
finer
form
the
jan
lucar
was
particularly
interested
he
pinched
and
stroked
chick
muscles
with
the
caressing
pride
of
a
connoisseur
watson
stepped
out
of
the
fountain
bath
in
all
the
vigour
of
health
he
playfully
reached
out
for
the
lucar
and
tripped
him
up
he
sought
to
learn
just
what
the
thomahlians
knew
in
the
art
of
the
brief
struggle
that
ensued
taught
him
that
he
need
expect
no
easy
conquest
the
jan
was
quick
active
and
the
possessor
of
a
science
peculiarly
effective
the
thomahlians
did
not
box
in
the
manner
of
the
their
mode
was
peculiar
chick
foresaw
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
combine
the
methods
of
three
kinds
of
combat
boxing
and
the
good
old
wrestling
if
the
senestro
were
superior
to
the
jan
he
would
have
a
time
indeed
though
watson
conquered
he
could
not
but
concede
that
the
jan
was
not
only
clever
but
scientific
to
an
oily
bewildering
degree
the
lucar
paused
enough
my
lord
you
are
a
man
indeed
do
not
overdo
save
yourself
for
the
clothes
were
brought
and
chick
taken
back
to
his
apartment
the
time
passed
with
rhamdas
constantly
at
his
side
the
geos
was
not
present
nor
the
little
queen
chick
sought
permission
to
sit
by
the
window
permission
that
was
granted
after
the
guards
had
placed
screens
that
would
withhold
any
view
from
outside
yet
permit
chick
to
look
out
as
far
as
he
could
see
the
avenues
were
packed
with
people
only
this
time
the
centres
of
the
streets
were
clear
on
the
curbs
he
could
see
the
opposing
lines
of
the
blue
and
crimson
holding
back
the
waiting
thousands
in
the
distance
he
could
hear
chimes
faint
but
distinct
like
silver
bells
tinkling
over
water
at
intervals
rose
strange
choruses
of
weird
holy
music
the
full
sweep
of
the
city
domes
and
minarets
was
spread
out
before
him
from
eaves
to
basements
the
rolling
luxuriance
of
orchidian
beauty
banners
music
parade
a
day
of
pageant
pomp
and
fulfilment
he
could
catch
the
excitement
in
the
air
the
strange
laden
undercurrent
of
spiritual
esoteric
undefinable
the
ecstasy
of
a
million
souls
pulsing
to
the
throb
of
a
supreme
moment
he
drew
back
someone
had
touched
him
what
is
it
it
was
one
of
the
rhamdas
he
had
in
his
hand
a
small
metal
clover
of
the
design
of
the
jarados
what
do
i
do
asked
watson
this
said
the
rhamda
was
sent
to
you
by
one
of
the
by
a
bar
what
does
it
mean
the
other
shook
his
head
it
was
sent
to
you
by
one
who
wished
it
to
be
known
by
us
that
he
is
your
friend
even
though
a
just
then
watson
noted
something
sticking
out
of
the
edge
of
one
of
the
clover
leaves
he
pulled
it
out
it
was
a
piece
of
paper
on
it
were
scrawled
words
in
english
the
writing
was
pencil
script
done
in
a
poor
hand
and
but
still
english
chick
read
be
of
good
cheer
there
ai
a
one
in
this
world
that
can
top
a
lad
from
frisco
and
it
pat
macpherson
that
says
it
yer
the
finest
laddie
that
ever
got
beyond
the
old
witch
of
endor
you
and
me
if
we
hold
on
is
just
about
goin
to
play
hell
with
the
haythen
hold
on
and
fight
like
the
divil
remember
that
pat
is
with
ye
we
both
spooks
pat
macpherson
said
watson
who
gave
you
this
did
you
see
the
man
it
was
sent
up
my
lord
the
man
was
a
high
bar
in
the
watson
could
not
understand
this
was
it
possible
that
there
were
others
in
this
mysterious
region
besides
himself
at
any
rate
he
was
wholly
alone
he
felt
that
he
could
count
upon
the
irishman
or
was
this
fellow
scotch
anyhow
such
a
man
would
find
the
quick
means
of
wit
at
a
crucial
moment
suddenly
watson
noted
a
queer
feeling
of
emptiness
he
looked
out
of
the
window
the
music
had
ceased
and
the
incessant
hum
of
the
throngs
had
deadened
to
silence
it
was
suspended
awesome
threatening
at
the
same
time
the
jan
lucar
came
to
attention
at
the
opposite
door
stood
the
rhamda
geos
black
clad
surrounded
by
a
group
of
his
fellows
come
my
lord
he
said
the
crimson
guard
fell
in
behind
watson
the
took
their
places
ahead
and
the
jan
lucar
and
the
geos
walked
on
either
side
they
stepped
out
into
the
corridor
by
the
indicator
of
a
vertical
clock
chick
noted
that
it
was
nine
he
did
not
know
the
day
of
the
year
other
than
from
the
thomahlian
calendar
but
he
knew
that
it
was
close
to
sunset
he
did
not
ask
where
they
were
going
there
was
no
need
the
very
solemnity
of
his
companions
told
him
more
than
their
answers
would
have
in
a
moment
they
were
in
the
streets
watson
had
thought
that
they
would
be
taken
by
aircraft
or
that
they
would
pass
through
the
building
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
a
concession
to
the
bar
senestro
that
the
senestro
was
but
playing
a
bit
of
psychology
that
is
often
practised
by
lesser
champions
if
nerve
was
not
broken
it
was
simply
because
of
the
iron
indifference
of
confident
health
chick
had
never
been
defeated
he
had
no
fear
he
was
far
more
curious
as
to
the
scenes
and
events
about
him
than
he
was
of
the
outcome
he
was
hoping
for
some
incident
that
would
link
itself
up
into
explanation
at
the
door
a
curious
car
of
graceful
lines
was
waiting
an
odd
affair
that
might
be
classed
as
a
cross
between
a
bird
and
a
gondola
streaming
with
colours
and
of
magnificent
workmanship
and
design
on
the
deck
of
this
the
three
men
took
their
places
on
the
one
side
the
rhamda
geos
tall
sombre
immaculate
on
the
other
the
magnificent
jan
lucar
in
the
gorgeous
crimson
uniform
and
studded
with
jewels
on
his
head
he
wore
the
shako
of
purple
down
and
by
his
side
a
peculiar
black
weapon
which
he
wore
much
in
the
manner
of
a
sword
in
the
centre
watson
bareheaded
his
torso
bare
and
his
arms
naked
he
had
been
given
a
pair
of
soft
sandals
and
a
short
suit
whose
one
redeeming
feature
in
his
eyes
was
a
pocket
into
which
he
had
thrust
the
automatic
that
he
valued
so
much
it
was
more
like
a
picture
of
rome
than
anything
else
whatever
the
civilisation
of
the
thomahlians
their
ritual
in
watson
eyes
smacked
still
of
barbarism
but
he
was
intensely
interested
in
all
about
him
the
avenues
were
large
on
either
side
the
guards
were
drawn
up
eight
deep
holding
back
the
multitude
that
pressed
and
jostled
with
the
insistence
of
curiosity
he
looked
into
the
myriad
faces
about
him
splendid
features
of
intelligent
man
and
women
not
one
face
suggested
the
hideous
the
women
were
especially
beautiful
and
from
what
he
could
see
finely
formed
and
graceful
many
of
them
smiled
he
could
hear
the
curious
buzz
of
conjecturing
whispers
some
were
indifferent
while
others
from
the
expression
of
their
faces
were
openly
hostile
chick
was
in
the
middle
of
a
procession
the
rhamdas
marching
before
and
the
crimson
guard
bringing
up
the
rear
a
special
guard
the
inner
one
rhamdas
the
outer
one
of
crimson
surrounding
them
all
the
car
started
there
was
no
trace
of
friction
it
was
noiseless
automatic
chick
could
only
conjecture
as
to
its
mechanism
the
black
column
of
rhamdas
moved
ahead
rhythmically
with
the
swing
of
solemn
grandeur
for
some
minutes
they
marched
through
the
streets
of
the
mahovisal
there
was
no
cheering
it
was
a
holy
awesome
occasion
chick
could
sense
the
undercurrent
of
the
staring
thousands
the
reverence
and
the
piety
it
was
the
day
of
the
prophet
they
were
staring
at
a
miracle
the
column
turned
a
corner
for
the
first
time
watson
was
staggered
by
sheer
immensity
for
the
first
time
he
felt
what
it
might
be
to
see
with
the
eyes
of
an
insect
had
he
been
an
ant
looking
up
at
the
columns
of
karnak
he
would
still
have
been
out
of
proportion
it
was
immense
colossal
beyond
man
it
was
of
the
omnipotent
the
pillared
portal
of
the
temple
of
the
bell
such
a
building
a
genius
might
dream
of
in
a
moment
of
unhampered
inspired
imagination
it
was
stupendous
the
pillars
were
hexagonal
in
shape
and
in
diameter
each
of
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
house
dropping
from
an
immense
height
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
originally
poured
out
in
the
form
of
molten
metal
from
immense
flares
that
fell
from
the
vaulted
architrave
such
was
the
design
chick
got
the
impression
that
the
top
of
the
structure
somehow
was
not
supported
by
the
foundation
but
rather
the
reverse
the
floor
was
suspended
from
the
ceiling
it
was
the
work
of
the
titans
so
high
and
stupendous
that
at
the
first
instant
watson
felt
numb
with
insignificance
what
chance
had
he
against
men
of
such
colossal
conception
how
large
the
building
was
he
could
not
see
the
gargantuan
facade
itself
was
enough
to
smother
comprehension
it
was
laid
out
in
the
form
of
a
triangle
one
end
of
which
was
open
towards
the
city
the
two
sections
of
the
facade
met
under
a
huge
arched
opening
the
door
itself
watson
recognised
the
structure
as
the
one
he
had
seen
from
the
june
bug
on
the
outskirts
of
the
mahovisal
the
enormous
plaza
was
packed
with
people
leaving
only
a
narrow
lane
for
the
procession
and
as
far
back
as
chick
could
see
crowds
in
the
streets
converged
towards
this
vast
space
their
numbers
were
incalculable
the
car
stopped
the
guards
both
crimson
and
blue
formed
a
cordon
watson
could
feel
the
suspended
breath
of
the
waiting
multitude
the
three
men
stepped
out
the
geos
first
then
the
jan
lucar
and
watson
last
chick
caught
the
lucar
eye
it
was
confident
the
man
was
springing
with
vigour
jovial
in
spite
of
the
moment
they
passed
between
two
of
the
huge
pillars
and
under
the
giant
arch
for
a
few
minutes
they
walked
through
what
seemed
to
chick
a
perfect
maze
of
those
titanic
columns
and
every
foot
was
marked
by
the
lines
of
crimson
and
blue
flanking
either
side
an
immense
sea
of
people
rose
high
into
the
forest
of
pillars
as
far
as
his
eye
could
reach
he
had
never
been
in
such
a
concourse
of
humanity
they
passed
through
an
inner
arch
a
smaller
and
lower
one
into
what
chick
guessed
was
the
temple
proper
and
if
chick
had
thought
the
anteroom
stupendous
he
saw
that
a
new
word
one
which
went
beyond
all
previous
experience
was
needed
to
describe
what
he
now
saw
it
was
almost
too
immense
to
be
grasped
in
its
entirety
gone
was
the
maze
of
columns
instead
far
far
away
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
stood
single
rows
of
herculean
pillars
there
were
but
seven
on
a
side
separated
by
great
distances
and
between
them
stretched
a
space
so
immense
so
incredibly
vast
that
a
small
city
could
have
been
housed
within
it
and
over
it
all
was
not
the
open
sky
but
a
ceiling
of
such
terrific
grandeur
that
chick
almost
halted
the
procession
while
he
gazed
for
that
ceiling
was
the
under
side
of
a
cloud
a
forbidding
thundercloud
and
the
fourteen
pillars
seven
on
either
side
were
prodigious
waterspouts
monster
spirals
of
the
hue
of
storm
with
flaring
sweeps
at
top
and
bottom
that
welded
roof
and
floor
into
one
terrific
whole
sheer
from
side
to
side
stretched
that
portentous
level
cloud
it
was
a
span
of
an
epoch
and
on
either
side
it
was
rooted
in
those
awful
columns
seemingly
alive
as
though
ready
at
any
instant
to
suck
up
the
earth
into
the
infinite
by
downright
watson
tore
his
attention
away
and
directed
it
upon
the
other
features
of
that
unprecedented
interior
it
was
lighted
apparently
by
great
windows
behind
the
fourteen
pillars
windows
too
far
to
be
distinguishable
and
the
light
revealed
directly
ahead
something
that
chick
at
first
thought
to
be
a
cascade
of
black
water
it
leaped
out
of
the
rear
wall
of
the
temple
and
at
its
crest
it
was
bordered
with
walls
of
solid
silver
cut
across
and
designed
with
scrolls
of
gold
and
gem
work
walls
that
swooped
down
and
ended
with
two
huge
green
columns
at
the
base
of
that
fantastic
fall
as
they
approached
a
swarm
of
tiny
bronze
objects
silver
winged
fluttered
out
through
the
temple
tiny
birds
smaller
than
swallows
beautiful
and
elusive
they
were
without
number
in
a
moment
the
air
of
the
temple
was
alive
with
flitting
darting
spots
of
glinting
colour
then
chick
saw
that
there
were
two
people
sitting
high
on
the
crest
of
that
cascade
wondering
chick
and
the
rest
marched
on
through
the
silent
crowd
all
standing
with
bared
heads
and
bated
breaths
the
worshipping
thomahlians
filled
every
inch
of
that
enormous
place
only
a
narrow
lane
permitted
the
procession
to
pass
towards
that
puzzling
silent
black
waterfall
they
were
almost
at
its
base
when
chick
saw
the
vanguard
of
the
rhamdas
unhesitatingly
stride
straight
against
the
torrent
and
then
mount
upon
it
up
they
marched
and
chick
knew
that
the
black
water
was
black
jade
and
that
the
two
people
at
its
crest
were
seated
upon
a
landing
at
the
top
of
the
grandest
stairway
he
had
ever
seen
up
went
the
rhamdas
deploying
to
right
and
left
against
the
silver
walls
the
crimson
and
blue
uniformed
guards
remained
behind
lining
the
lane
through
the
throng
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
chick
stopped
and
looked
around
and
again
he
felt
numb
at
the
sheer
vastness
of
it
all
for
he
was
looking
back
now
at
the
portal
through
which
the
procession
had
marched
a
portal
now
closed
and
above
it
covering
a
great
expanse
of
that
wall
and
extending
up
almost
into
the
brooding
cloud
above
was
spread
a
mighty
replica
of
the
sign
of
the
jarados
for
the
first
time
chick
felt
the
full
significance
of
symbolism
whereas
before
it
had
been
but
an
incident
of
adventure
now
it
was
the
symbol
of
mystic
revelation
it
was
not
only
the
motif
for
all
other
decoration
upon
the
walls
and
minor
elements
of
the
temple
it
was
the
emblem
of
the
trinity
deep
holy
significant
of
the
mystery
of
the
universe
and
the
hereafter
there
was
something
deeper
than
mere
fatalism
behind
all
was
the
faith
of
a
civilisation
but
at
that
moment
as
chick
paused
with
one
foot
on
the
bottom
step
of
the
flight
something
happened
that
sent
quivers
of
joy
and
confidence
all
through
him
someone
was
talking
talking
in
english
chick
looked
the
speaker
was
a
man
in
the
blue
garb
of
the
guard
he
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
line
nearest
the
stair
and
slightly
in
front
of
his
fellows
like
the
rest
he
was
holding
his
weapon
a
black
sword
at
the
salute
chick
gave
him
only
a
glance
then
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
look
elsewhere
as
a
man
said
in
a
low
guarded
voice
y
air
right
me
lad
do
look
at
me
i
know
what
ye
thinkin
but
she
ai
as
bad
as
she
looks
keep
yer
heart
clear
never
fear
you
me
can
lick
all
thomahlia
go
straight
up
them
stairs
an
stand
that
blackguard
senestro
on
his
just
like
y
do
in
frisco
who
are
you
asked
watson
intent
upon
the
great
clover
he
used
the
same
low
cautious
tone
the
other
had
employed
who
are
you
friend
pat
macpherson
of
course
was
the
answer
an
oi
said
a
plenty
now
go
aboot
your
watson
did
not
quibble
there
was
no
time
to
learn
more
he
did
not
wish
it
to
be
noticed
yet
he
could
not
hide
it
from
the
jan
lucar
and
the
rhamda
geos
who
were
still
at
his
side
they
had
heard
that
tongue
before
the
looks
they
exchanged
told
however
that
they
were
gratified
rather
than
displeased
by
the
interruption
certainly
all
feelings
of
depression
left
chick
and
he
ascended
the
stairs
with
a
glad
heart
and
a
resilient
stride
that
could
not
but
be
noticed
he
was
ready
for
the
senestro
xli
the
prophecy
reaching
the
top
of
the
jade
steps
chick
found
the
landing
to
be
a
great
dais
nearly
a
hundred
feet
across
on
the
right
and
left
this
dais
was
hedged
in
by
the
silver
walls
on
each
of
which
was
hung
a
huge
golden
scrollwork
these
scrolls
bore
legends
which
for
the
moment
chick
ignored
at
the
rear
of
the
dais
was
a
large
object
like
a
bronze
bell
the
floor
was
of
the
usual
mosaic
except
in
the
centre
where
there
was
a
plain
circular
design
chick
took
careful
note
of
this
a
circle
about
twenty
feet
across
as
white
and
unbroken
as
a
bed
of
frozen
snow
whether
it
was
stone
or
not
he
could
not
determine
all
around
its
edge
was
a
gap
that
separated
it
from
the
dais
a
gap
several
inches
across
chick
turned
to
geos
the
spot
of
life
even
so
it
is
the
strangest
thing
in
all
the
thomahlia
my
lord
can
you
feel
it
for
watson
had
reached
out
with
his
toe
and
touched
the
white
surface
he
drew
it
back
suddenly
it
has
a
feeling
he
replied
that
i
can
not
describe
it
is
cold
and
yet
it
is
not
perhaps
it
is
my
own
ah
it
is
well
my
lord
what
the
rhamda
meant
by
that
chick
could
not
tell
he
was
interested
in
the
odd
white
substance
it
was
as
smooth
as
glass
although
at
intervals
there
were
faint
almost
imperceptible
dark
lines
like
the
finest
scratches
in
old
ivory
yet
the
whiteness
was
not
dazzling
again
watson
touched
it
with
his
foot
and
noted
the
inexplicable
feeling
of
exhilaration
in
the
moment
of
absorption
he
quite
forgot
the
concourse
about
him
he
knew
that
he
was
now
standing
on
the
crux
of
the
blind
spot
but
in
a
minute
he
turned
the
dais
was
a
sort
of
nave
with
one
end
open
to
the
stairway
seated
on
his
left
was
the
frail
aradna
occupying
a
small
chair
of
some
translucent
green
material
on
the
right
sat
the
bar
senestro
in
a
chair
differing
only
in
that
its
colour
was
a
bright
blue
in
the
centre
of
the
dais
stood
a
third
chair
a
crimson
one
empty
the
senestro
stood
up
he
was
royally
clad
his
breast
gleaming
with
jewels
he
was
certainly
handsome
he
had
the
carriage
of
confident
royalty
there
was
no
fear
in
this
man
no
uncertainty
no
weakness
if
confidence
were
a
thing
of
strength
the
senestro
was
already
the
victor
in
his
heart
chick
secretly
admired
him
but
just
then
the
aradna
stood
up
she
made
an
indication
to
watson
he
stepped
over
to
the
queen
she
sat
down
again
i
want
to
give
you
my
benediction
stranger
lord
are
you
sure
of
yourself
can
you
overcome
the
senestro
i
am
certain
spoke
watson
it
is
for
the
queen
o
aradna
i
know
nothing
of
the
prophecy
but
i
will
fight
for
you
she
blushed
and
cast
a
furtive
look
in
the
direction
of
the
senestro
it
is
well
she
spoke
the
outcome
will
have
a
double
interpretation
the
spiritual
one
of
the
prophecy
and
the
earthly
material
one
that
concerns
myself
if
you
conquer
my
lord
i
am
freed
i
would
not
marry
the
senestro
i
love
him
not
i
would
abide
by
the
prophet
and
await
the
she
hesitated
what
do
you
know
of
the
chosen
my
lord
nothing
o
has
not
the
rhamda
geos
told
you
partly
but
not
fully
there
is
something
that
he
is
very
likely
and
now
will
you
kneel
my
lord
watson
knelt
the
queen
held
out
her
hand
behind
him
chick
could
hear
a
deep
murmur
from
the
assembled
multitudes
just
what
was
the
significance
of
that
sound
he
did
not
know
nor
did
he
care
it
was
enough
for
him
that
he
was
to
fight
for
this
delicately
beautiful
maiden
he
would
let
the
prophecy
take
care
of
itself
besides
these
three
on
the
dais
there
were
only
the
rhamda
geos
and
the
jan
lucar
these
two
remained
on
the
edge
nearest
the
body
of
the
temple
the
edge
at
the
crest
of
the
stair
the
empty
chair
remained
so
suddenly
chick
remembered
the
warning
of
holcomb
read
the
words
of
the
and
he
took
advantage
of
the
to
peruse
the
legends
on
the
great
golden
scrolls
the
prophecy
of
the
jarados
behold
when
the
day
is
at
hand
prepare
ye
for
when
that
day
cometh
ye
shall
have
signs
and
portents
from
the
world
beyond
wisdom
cometh
out
of
life
and
life
walketh
out
of
wisdom
yea
in
the
manner
of
life
and
of
spirit
ye
shall
have
them
and
of
substance
even
like
unto
you
yourselves
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
days
that
we
shall
be
on
guard
by
these
signs
ye
shall
know
them
even
by
the
truths
i
have
taught
thee
the
way
of
life
is
an
open
door
wisdom
and
virtue
are
its
keys
and
when
the
intelligence
shall
be
lifted
to
the
plane
above
then
shalt
thou
know
mark
ye
well
the
spot
of
life
he
that
openeth
it
is
the
precursor
of
judgment
mark
him
well
and
thus
shall
the
last
days
come
to
pass
see
that
ye
are
worthy
o
wise
ones
for
behold
in
those
last
days
there
shall
come
among
ye
the
chosen
of
a
line
of
kings
first
there
shall
be
one
and
then
there
shall
be
two
and
the
two
shall
stay
but
the
one
shall
return
the
false
ones
them
ye
shall
slay
the
four
footed
the
call
to
humility
sacrifice
and
devotion
whom
ye
shall
hold
in
reverence
even
as
you
hold
me
the
jarados
and
on
the
last
day
of
all
i
the
jarados
beware
ye
of
sacrilege
lest
i
take
from
ye
all
that
i
have
given
ye
and
the
day
be
postponed
beware
ye
of
sacrilege
and
if
the
false
ones
cometh
not
ye
shall
know
that
i
have
held
them
know
ye
the
day
sixteen
days
from
the
day
of
the
prophet
shall
come
the
day
of
the
judgment
and
the
way
shall
be
opened
on
the
last
day
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
jarados
hearken
to
the
words
of
the
jarados
the
prophet
and
mouthpiece
of
the
infinite
intelligence
ruler
of
justice
peace
and
love
so
be
it
forever
chick
read
it
a
second
time
like
all
prophecies
it
was
somewhat
delphic
but
he
could
get
the
general
drift
in
that
golden
script
he
was
looking
into
the
heart
of
all
thomahlia
into
its
greatness
its
culture
its
civilisation
itself
it
was
the
soul
of
the
blind
spot
the
reason
and
the
wherefore
of
all
about
him
he
heard
someone
step
up
behind
him
and
he
turned
it
was
the
senestro
going
over
the
words
of
the
prophecy
can
you
read
it
sir
phantom
asked
the
handsome
bar
his
black
eyes
were
twinkling
with
delight
have
you
read
it
all
he
put
a
hand
on
chick
shoulder
it
was
a
careless
act
almost
friendly
either
he
had
the
heart
of
a
devil
or
the
chivalry
of
a
paladin
he
pointed
to
a
line
false
ones
them
ye
shall
slay
and
if
i
were
the
false
one
you
would
slay
me
asked
watson
aye
truly
answered
the
splendid
prince
you
are
well
made
and
good
to
look
upon
i
shall
hold
you
in
my
arms
i
shall
hear
your
bones
crack
it
shall
be
sweeter
music
than
that
of
the
temple
pheasants
who
never
sing
but
for
the
jarados
i
shall
slay
you
upon
the
spot
sir
phantom
watson
turned
on
his
heel
the
ethics
of
the
senestro
were
not
of
his
own
code
he
was
not
afraid
he
stood
beside
the
jan
lucar
and
gazed
out
into
the
body
of
the
temple
as
far
as
he
could
see
under
and
past
the
fourteen
great
pillars
and
right
up
to
the
far
wall
the
floor
was
a
vast
carpet
of
humanity
it
was
become
dark
presently
a
new
kind
of
light
began
to
glow
far
overhead
gradually
increasing
in
strength
until
the
whole
place
was
suffused
with
a
illumination
the
rhamda
geos
began
to
speak
in
the
last
day
in
the
day
of
life
we
have
the
substance
of
ourselves
and
the
words
of
the
prophet
the
jarados
has
written
his
prophecy
in
letters
of
gold
for
all
to
see
false
ones
them
ye
shall
slay
it
is
the
will
of
the
rhamdas
that
the
great
bar
senestro
shall
try
the
proof
of
the
occult
on
this
the
first
of
the
sixteen
days
the
test
shall
be
on
the
spot
of
life
he
turned
away
the
bar
senestro
stripped
off
his
jewels
his
and
stood
clad
in
the
manner
of
watson
they
advanced
and
met
in
the
centre
of
the
dais
two
athletes
lithe
strong
handsome
their
muscles
aquiver
with
vitality
and
their
skins
silken
with
health
champions
of
two
worlds
to
wrestle
for
truth
a
low
murmur
arose
increasing
until
it
filled
the
whole
coliseum
the
pheasants
flitted
above
the
heads
of
all
flashing
like
fragments
of
the
spirit
of
light
and
all
of
a
sudden
one
of
them
fluttered
down
and
lit
on
watson
shoulder
the
murmur
of
the
throng
dropped
to
a
dead
silence
next
moment
a
stranger
thing
happened
the
little
creature
broke
forth
in
song
watson
instantly
remembered
the
words
of
the
bar
senestro
they
sing
but
for
the
he
quietly
reached
up
and
caught
the
songster
in
his
hand
and
he
held
it
up
to
the
astonished
crowd
still
the
song
continued
chick
held
him
an
instant
longer
and
then
gave
him
a
toss
high
into
the
air
he
shot
across
the
temple
a
streak
of
melody
silver
dulcet
to
the
far
corner
of
the
giant
building
but
the
thing
did
not
jar
the
senestro
well
done
sir
phantom
anyhow
is
your
last
play
i
would
not
have
it
otherwise
i
hope
you
can
die
as
prettily
are
you
ready
ready
what
for
retorted
watson
why
should
i
trouble
myself
with
preparations
but
the
rhamda
geos
had
now
come
to
his
side
do
your
best
my
lord
i
regret
only
that
it
must
be
to
the
death
it
is
the
first
death
contest
in
the
thomahlia
for
a
thousand
circles
years
but
the
senestro
has
challenged
the
prophecy
prove
that
you
are
not
a
false
one
my
heart
is
with
it
was
a
good
word
at
a
needed
moment
watson
stepped
over
onto
the
circular
spot
of
life
they
were
both
barefooted
evidently
the
thomahlians
fought
in
the
old
classic
manner
the
stone
under
watson
feet
was
cool
and
invigorating
he
could
sense
anew
that
quiver
of
magnetism
and
strength
it
sent
a
thrill
through
his
whole
body
like
the
subtle
quickening
of
life
he
felt
vital
joyous
confident
the
senestro
was
smiling
his
eyes
flashing
with
anticipation
his
muscled
body
was
a
network
of
soft
movement
his
step
was
catlike
what
will
it
be
inquired
watson
name
your
choice
of
but
the
bar
shook
his
head
not
so
sir
phantom
you
shall
choose
the
manner
of
your
death
not
i
particular
i
am
not
nor
make
it
wrestling
then
in
his
most
manner
he
was
a
good
wrestler
and
scientific
good
are
you
ready
very
well
sir
phantom
i
shall
walk
to
the
edge
of
the
spot
and
turn
around
i
would
take
no
unfair
advantage
now
chick
turned
at
the
same
moment
and
strode
to
his
edge
he
turned
and
it
happened
just
what
chick
never
knew
he
remembered
seeing
his
opponent
turn
slowly
about
and
in
the
next
split
second
he
was
spinning
in
the
clutch
of
a
tiger
even
before
they
struck
the
stone
chick
could
feel
the
senestro
reaching
for
a
and
in
that
one
second
watson
knew
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
his
master
his
mind
functioned
like
lightning
his
legs
and
arms
flashed
for
the
counterhold
that
would
save
him
they
struck
the
spot
and
rolled
over
and
over
chick
caught
his
hold
but
the
senestro
broke
it
almost
instantly
yet
it
had
saved
him
for
a
minute
they
spun
around
like
a
pair
of
whirligigs
watson
kept
on
the
defensive
he
had
not
the
speed
and
skill
of
the
other
it
was
no
mere
test
to
touch
his
shoulders
it
was
a
fight
to
the
death
he
was
at
a
disadvantage
he
worked
desperately
when
a
man
fights
for
his
life
he
becomes
superhuman
watson
was
put
to
something
more
than
his
skill
the
sheer
spirit
of
the
bar
broke
hold
after
hold
he
was
like
lightning
subtle
vicious
time
after
time
he
spun
chick
out
of
his
defense
and
bore
him
down
into
a
hold
of
death
and
each
time
chick
somehow
wriggled
out
and
saved
himself
by
a
new
hold
the
struggle
became
a
blur
muscle
legs
the
lust
for
killing
and
hatred
twice
watson
essayed
the
offensive
first
he
got
a
hammer
lock
and
then
a
the
bar
broke
both
holds
immediately
whatever
chick
knew
of
wrestling
the
senestro
knew
just
a
bit
more
it
was
a
whirling
mass
of
legs
and
bodies
in
continuous
convulsion
silent
except
for
the
terrible
panting
of
the
men
and
the
low
stifled
exclamations
of
the
onlookers
and
then
watson
grew
weak
he
tried
once
more
they
spun
to
their
feet
but
before
he
could
act
the
senestro
had
caught
him
in
the
same
flying
rush
as
in
the
beginning
and
had
whirled
him
off
his
feet
and
when
he
came
down
the
bar
had
an
unbreakable
hold
chick
struggled
in
vain
the
bar
tightened
his
grip
a
spasm
of
pain
shot
through
chick
torso
he
could
feel
his
bones
giving
way
his
strength
was
gone
he
could
see
death
another
moment
would
have
been
the
end
but
something
happened
the
senestro
miraculously
let
go
his
hold
chick
felt
something
soft
brush
against
his
cheek
he
heard
a
queer
snapping
and
shouts
of
wonder
and
a
dreadful
choking
sound
from
the
bar
he
raised
dizzily
on
one
arm
his
eyes
cleared
a
bit
the
great
bar
was
on
his
back
and
at
his
throat
was
a
snarling
thing
the
creature
that
chick
had
seen
in
the
clover
leaf
of
the
jarados
it
was
a
living
dog
pat
macpherson
story
to
watson
it
was
all
a
blur
he
was
too
weak
and
too
broken
to
remember
distinctly
he
was
conscious
only
of
an
uproar
of
a
torrent
of
multitudinous
sound
and
then
the
deep
enveloping
tone
of
a
bell
some
time
somewhere
chick
had
heard
that
bell
before
in
his
present
condition
his
memory
refused
to
serve
him
he
was
covered
with
blood
he
tried
to
rise
to
crawl
to
this
snarling
animal
that
was
throttling
the
senestro
but
something
seemed
to
snap
within
him
and
all
went
black
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
all
had
changed
he
was
lying
on
a
couch
with
a
number
of
people
about
it
was
a
minute
before
he
recognized
the
jan
lucar
then
the
geos
and
lastly
the
nurse
whom
he
had
first
seen
when
he
awoke
in
the
blind
spot
evidently
he
was
in
the
hands
of
his
friends
although
there
was
a
new
one
a
man
clad
in
the
blue
uniform
of
a
high
bar
he
sat
up
the
nurse
held
a
goblet
of
the
green
liquid
to
his
lips
the
bar
in
blue
turned
aye
he
said
give
him
some
of
the
liquor
it
will
do
him
good
it
will
put
the
old
energy
back
in
his
the
voice
rang
oddly
familiar
in
watson
ears
the
words
were
thomahlian
not
until
chick
had
drained
his
glass
did
he
comprehend
their
significance
who
are
you
he
asked
the
bar
with
the
red
hair
grinned
whist
me
lad
using
chick
own
tongue
get
rid
of
these
thomahlians
is
a
square
game
we
playin
but
we
takin
no
chances
get
out
of
the
way
so
we
kin
watson
turned
to
the
others
he
made
the
request
in
his
adopted
tongue
they
bowed
reverently
and
withdrew
who
are
you
chick
asked
again
oi
pat
how
did
you
get

thoughts
just
like

oop
lumber
is
that
deep
he
is
wit

watson
tried
to
think
there
was
just
one
superlative
question
now
he
put
it
i
dinna
know
if
he
th
jarados
was
the
reply
but
if
so
be
not
then
he
his

the
senestro

home
av
th
jarados
was
held
always
holy
by
th
thomahlians
no
man
dared
go
within
miles
av
it
since
the
jarados
was
here
of
years
ago
no
one
at
all
has
been
inside
av
it
but
the
senestro
knew
that
th
doctor
was
th
real
jarados
at
least
he
so
an
he
wasna
afraid
o
him
he
na
coward
th
senestro
he
put
th
doctor
in
th
jarados
home
only
th
prophecy
worries
him
at
at
last
watson
was
touching
firm
ground
things
were
beginning
to
link
up
the
senestro
the
professor
the
prophecy
of
the
jarados
well
sor
we
bars
have
kept
th
ould
doctor
prisoner
there
iver
since
he
come
wit
none
save
me
to
give
him
a
wee
bit
word
av
comfort
but
it
dinna
hurt
th
old
gent
whin
he
finds
all
them
balls
an
rainbows
eddicated
secrets
he
forgets
iverything
else
he
contint
wit
discovery
is
th
wise
head
th
doctor
has
an
oi
make
no
doobt
th
real
the
man
went
on
to
say
that
the
professor
knew
of
coming
from
the
beginning
he
immediately
called
in
macpherson
and
gave
him
some
orders
or
rather
directions
which
the
irishman
could
not
understand
he
knew
only
that
he
was
to
go
to
the
temple
of
the
leaf
and
there
touch
certain
objects
in
a
certain
way
also
he
was
to
arrange
to
get
near
chick
and
give
him
a
word
of
cheer
but
it
dinna
work
as
he
said
it
sor
he
had
expected
to
catch
senestro
instead
was
th
dog
got
th
bar
a
foine
pup
sor
she
saved
yer
where
the
dog
now
she
on
th
spot
av
life
sor
she
willna
leave
it
tis
a
strange
thing
to
see
how
she
clings
to
it
th
rhamdas
only
come
near
enough
to
feed
thus
chick
learned
that
as
soon
as
he
got
well
he
and
macpherson
were
to
seek
the
doctor
and
help
him
to
get
away
with
the
secrets
he
had
found
the
truths
behind
the
mystery
of
the
spot
an
is
a
glorious
fight
there
be
lad
th
senestro
a
game
wan
he
not
give
up
an
he
not
let
go
th
doctor
till
he
has
this
was
not
unwelcome
news
to
chick
a
battle
was
to
his
liking
it
reminded
him
of
the
automatic
pistol
which
he
still
had
in
his
pocket
the
gun
he
had
not
thought
to
use
in
his
desperate
struggle
with
the
bar
senestro
pat
said
he
with
a
sudden
inspriation
when
you
came
through
did
you
have
a
firearm
macpherson
reached
into
his
pocket
and
silently
produced
a
calibre
pistol
of
another
make
than
chick
but
using
the
same
ammunition
from
another
pocket
he
drew
out
a
package
carefully
bound
with
thread
he
unrolled
the
contents
it
was
an
old
clay
pipe
oi
came
through
he
stated
plaintively
wit
two
guns
an
nary
a
bit
av
powder
for
ayther
chick
smiled
he
searched
his
own
pockets
first
he
handed
over
his
extra
magazine
full
of
cartridges
and
then
a
full
package
of
smoking
tobacco
wirra
wirra
shouted
macpherson
faith
an
there
powder
for
both
his
hands
shook
as
he
hurried
to
cram
the
old
pipe
full
of
tobacco
the
cartridges
could
wait
he
struck
a
light
and
gave
a
deep
sigh
of
content
as
he
began
to
puff
xliii
the
home
of
the
jarados
chick
had
been
grievously
hurt
in
the
contest
with
the
senestro
but
thanks
to
the
rhamdas
he
came
round
rapidly
it
was
a
matter
of
less
than
a
week
things
were
coming
to
a
climax
chick
needed
no
lynx
eye
to
see
that
the
die
had
been
cast
between
the
bars
and
the
rhamdas
soon
the
senestro
must
make
a
bold
move
or
else
release
the
professor
chick
had
not
long
to
wait
it
came
one
evening
once
again
he
found
himself
in
the
june
bug
accompanied
by
the
geos
the
jan
lucar
and
the
little
aradna
herself
their
departure
was
swift
and
secret
this
time
watson
was
not
worried
over
height
or
any
other
sensation
of
flight
the
doctor
safety
alone
was
of
moment
he
said
to
the
rhamda
are
we
alone
where
is
the
bar
macpherson
he
is
somewhere
near
we
are
not
alone
my
lord
several
other
machines
are
flying
nearby
also
they
carry
many
of
the
rhamdas
and
the
crimson
guard
of
the
queen
the
macpherson
will
arrive
first
we
are
going
straight
to
the
palace
of
light
my
are
we
to
storm
the
place
thinking
of
the
fight
macpherson
had
predicted
yes
my
lord
many
shall
die
but
it
can
not
be
helped
we
must
free
the
jarados
although
we
commit
but
the
senestro
that
depends
my
lord
we
know
not
just
what
may
be
he
gave
no
explanation
they
had
climbed
to
a
tremendous
height
the
indicator
showed
that
they
were
bearing
east
the
darkness
was
modified
only
by
the
faint
glow
from
that
sky
looking
down
chick
could
see
nothing
whatever
his
companions
kept
silence
only
the
aradna
sitting
forward
by
the
side
of
jan
lucar
showed
any
perturbation
they
climbed
higher
and
higher
still
until
it
seemed
that
they
must
leave
the
thomahlia
altogether
always
the
course
was
eastward
at
last
the
jan
said
to
the
geos
we
are
now
over
the
region
of
carbon
sir
shall
i
risk
the
light
his
lordship
might
like
to
follow
your
own
oh
exclaimed
the
aradna
do
it
by
all
means
there
is
nothing
so
wonderful
as
that
the
jan
touched
a
small
lever
instantly
a
shaft
of
light
cut
down
through
the
blackness
far
far
below
it
ended
in
a
patch
on
the
ground
watson
eagerly
followed
its
movements
as
it
searched
from
side
to
side
seeking
he
knew
not
what
and
then
there
was
a
flash
of
inverted
lightning
a
flame
of
white
fire
a
blinding
stabbing
scintillation
of
a
million
coruscations
watson
clapped
a
hand
to
his
eyes
to
cut
off
the
sight
it
was
stunning
what
is
it
he
cried
carbon
answered
the
geos
calmly
carbon
you
mean
diamond
yes
my
lord
so
it
interests
you
i
did
not
know
later
you
shall
see
it
under
more
favourable
then
to
the
jan
once
again
they
were
in
darkness
for
some
minutes
silence
was
again
the
rule
watson
watched
the
red
dot
moving
across
the
indicator
noting
its
approach
to
a
three
cornered
figure
on
one
edge
suddenly
there
appeared
another
dot
then
another
and
another
some
came
from
below
others
from
above
presently
there
were
a
score
moving
in
close
formation
they
are
all
here
said
the
jan
to
the
geos
the
other
nodded
and
explained
to
chick
it
the
rhamdas
and
the
crimson
guards
the
macpherson
is
just
ahead
we
shall
arrive
in
three
and
after
a
pause
he
stated
that
the
ensuing
combat
would
mark
the
first
spilling
of
blood
between
the
bars
and
the
rhamdas
at
a
pinch
the
senestro
might
even
kill
the
jarados
to
gain
his
ends
his
wish
is
his
only
law
my
the
red
dots
began
to
descend
toward
the
figure
one
minute
passed
and
another
then
one
more
and
the
june
bug
landed
with
scarcely
a
sound
the
lucar
brought
the
craft
to
a
full
stop
in
a
moment
he
was
assisting
the
aradna
to
alight
as
for
the
geos
he
took
from
the
machine
two
objects
which
he
held
out
to
the
aradna
and
to
chick
put
these
on
the
rest
of
us
fight
as
we
they
were
cloaks
made
of
a
soft
light
malleable
glass
or
something
like
it
watson
asked
what
they
were
for
for
a
purpose
known
only
to
the
jarados
my
lord
there
are
only
two
of
these
robes
with
them
he
left
directions
which
indicated
plainly
they
are
for
your
lordship
and
the
wondering
chick
helped
the
aradna
don
her
garment
and
then
slipped
into
his
own
nevertheless
he
pinned
more
faith
in
the
automatic
in
his
pocket
he
did
not
make
use
of
the
hood
which
was
intended
to
cover
his
head
pardon
me
spoke
the
queen
she
reached
over
and
extended
the
hood
till
it
protected
his
skull
please
wear
it
that
way
for
my
sake
nothing
must
happen
to
you
now
chick
obeyed
with
only
an
inward
demur
what
puzzled
him
most
was
the
isolation
seemingly
they
were
quite
alone
there
was
nothing
no
one
to
oppose
them
but
he
had
merely
taken
something
for
granted
he
being
from
the
earth
had
assumed
that
strife
meant
noise
it
was
only
when
the
aradna
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
whispered
for
him
to
listen
that
he
understood
it
was
like
a
breeze
that
sound
to
be
more
precise
it
was
like
the
heavy
passage
of
breath
almost
uninterrupted
coming
from
all
about
them
and
presently
chick
caught
a
queer
odour
what
is
it
he
breathed
in
the
aradna
ear
it
is
death
she
answered
can
not
you
hear
them
the
deherers
she
did
not
explain
but
watson
knew
that
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
battle
which
was
fought
with
noiseless
and
terribly
efficient
weapons
so
efficient
that
there
were
no
wounded
to
give
voice
to
pain
before
he
could
ask
a
question
a
familiar
voice
sounded
out
of
the
darkness
at
his
side
where
is
the
geos
here
bar
macpherson
answered
the
rhamda
good
it
is
well
you
came
sir
we
were
discovered
a
few
minutes
ago
already
we
have
lost
many
men
just
give
us
the
lights
so
that
we
can
get
at
them
it
is
a
waste
of
men
with
the
advantage
all
on
their
then
lapsing
into
english
for
chick
benefit
is
welcome
ye
are
ivery
mon
helps
what
are
these
sounds
you
say
they
are
fighting
is
the
deherers
ye
hear
lad
they
fight
with
silent
guns
do
let
hit
ye
or
ye
be
a
pink
pool
in
the
twinklin
of
yer
eyelid
is
no
joke
are
they
more
powerful
than
firearms
i
dinna
say
lad
but
they
th
devil
own
weapon
for
chick
did
not
answer
he
had
heard
a
low
command
from
the
geos
next
instant
the
space
before
them
was
illuminated
by
clear
white
light
in
the
form
of
a
circle
bright
as
day
in
the
centre
shimmered
an
object
like
a
mist
of
blue
flame
a
nimbus
of
dazzling
actinic
lightning
there
was
no
sign
of
man
or
life
no
suggestion
of
sound
nothing
but
the
nimbus
and
the
brilliant
space
about
it
the
whole
phenomenon
measured
perhaps
three
hundred
feet
across
they
were
in
darkness
chick
took
a
step
forward
but
he
was
held
back
by
macpherson
nay
lad
would
ye
be
dyin
so
soon
is
fearful
quick
see
he
did
not
finish
a
red
line
of
soldiers
had
rushed
straight
out
of
the
blackness
into
the
circle
of
light
it
seemed
that
they
were
charging
the
nimbus
they
were
stooping
now
discharging
their
queer
weapons
about
three
hundred
of
them
an
inspiring
sight
they
charged
in
determined
silence
then
watson
blinked
the
line
disappeared
the
thing
was
like
a
miracle
it
took
time
for
chick
to
realise
that
he
was
looking
upon
the
pink
death
macpherson
had
warned
him
against
the
work
of
the
deherers
whatever
the
word
meant
for
where
had
been
a
column
of
gallant
guards
there
was
now
only
a
broad
stream
of
pink
liquid
trickling
over
the
ground
it
was
annihilation
itself
too
quick
to
be
horrible
inexorable
and
instantaneous
chick
involuntarily
placed
himself
in
front
of
the
aradna
the
blue
thing
in
the
middle
observed
the
irishman
coolly
is
palace
av
light
is
held
by
th
senestro
jest
now
an
all
we
got
to
do
is
get
th
ould
doc
but
i
see
no
building
is
there
jest
the
same
ye
see
it
whin
th
doctor
gits
time
off
his
rainbows
is
he
gets
when
he
on
a
problem
which
same
is
mostly
always
sor
we
stay
roight
here
till
he
gets
ready
to
drop
on
th
watson
waited
he
knew
enough
now
to
cling
to
the
shadow
there
with
macpherson
the
geos
and
the
aradna
in
the
centre
of
the
great
the
nimbus
of
blue
stood
out
like
a
vibrating
haze
while
all
about
in
the
darkness
could
be
heard
the
weird
sound
made
by
the
passage
of
life
when
will
the
jarados
act
inquired
the
geos
of
the
irishman
but
he
got
no
reply
macpherson
spoke
to
watson
get
yer
gun
ready
lad
get
yer
gun
ready
look
is
th
ould
boy
himself
now
i
wonder
what
the
senestro
thinks
of
that
for
the
nimbus
had
suddenly
dissolved
and
in
its
place
there
appeared
one
of
the
quaintest
yet
most
beautiful
buildings
that
watson
had
ever
seen
it
was
a
structure
and
of
unspeakably
dazzling
magnificence
a
building
carved
and
chiselled
from
solid
carbon
chick
momentarily
forgot
the
doctor
in
front
of
it
stood
a
line
of
blue
guards
headed
by
the
senestro
their
confusion
showed
that
something
altogether
unexpected
had
happened
they
were
ducking
here
and
there
seemingly
bewildered
by
the
sudden
vanishing
of
that
protecting
blue
dazzle
the
senestro
was
trying
to
restore
order
and
in
a
moment
he
succeeded
he
led
the
way
toward
a
low
triangular
platform
at
the
entrance
a
single
white
door
to
the
palace
pat
macpherson
automatic
flashed
and
barked
next
instant
watson
was
in
action
the
bar
next
to
the
senestro
staggered
then
collapsed
against
his
chieftain
another
rolled
against
his
feet
causing
him
to
stumble
an
act
that
probably
saved
his
life
for
the
platform
in
a
second
was
covered
with
writhing
bleeding
dying
bars
the
senestro
managed
to
reach
the
doorway
macpherson
cursed
come
on
he
yelled
to
watson
well
git
him
alive
watson
remembered
little
of
that
rush
there
stood
the
great
bar
at
the
doorway
surrounded
by
his
dying
and
men
the
cloak
given
chick
by
the
geos
impeded
his
progress
with
a
quick
movement
he
threw
it
off
and
ran
unprotected
alongside
the
irishman
the
blue
guards
saw
them
coming
they
levelled
their
weapons
but
before
they
could
discharge
them
they
met
the
same
fate
as
had
the
reds
a
tremor
in
the
air
and
they
were
gone
leaving
only
a
pink
pool
on
the
ground
senestro
alone
remained
untouched
he
was
about
to
open
the
white
door
for
a
second
he
posed
defiant
and
handsome
then
the
great
bar
ducked
swiftly
and
almost
with
the
same
motion
dodged
into
the
building
chick
and
pat
were
right
after
him
inside
was
darkness
chick
ran
head
on
against
the
side
wall
turning
he
bumped
into
another
the
sudden
transition
from
brilliance
to
blackness
was
overwhelming
he
stopped
and
felt
about
carefully
momentarily
blind
what
if
the
senestro
found
him
now
he
called
macpherson
name
there
was
no
reply
he
tried
to
feel
his
way
along
finding
the
wall
irregular
jagged
sharp
cornered
but
the
way
must
lead
somewhere
he
reached
a
turn
in
the
passage
it
was
still
too
dark
for
him
to
see
anything
he
proceeded
more
cautiously
wondering
at
those
craggy
walls
and
then
chick
slapped
his
hands
to
his
eyes
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
shot
into
the
core
of
the
sun
the
obsidian
darkness
flashed
into
light
a
light
beyond
all
enduring
chick
staggered
and
cried
in
pain
and
yet
reason
told
him
just
what
it
was
just
what
had
happened
it
was
the
carbon
he
was
in
the
heart
of
the
diamond
the
senestro
had
led
him
on
and
on
and
then
had
flashed
some
intense
light
upon
the
vast
jewel
watson
knew
the
terrible
helplessness
of
the
blind
his
end
had
come
and
so
it
seemed
next
instant
someone
came
up
to
him
someone
he
could
hear
if
he
could
not
see
it
was
the
senestro
hail
sir
phantom
pardon
my
abrupt
manner
of
welcome
i
suppose
you
have
come
for
the
jarados
and
he
laughed
a
laugh
full
of
mockery
and
triumph
perhaps
you
think
i
intend
to
kill
you
watson
said
no
word
he
had
been
outwitted
he
awaited
the
end
but
the
senestro
saw
fit
to
say
with
an
irony
that
told
how
sure
he
was
however
i
am
opposed
to
killing
in
cold
blood
open
your
eyes
sir
phantom
i
will
give
you
time
a
fair
chance
what
do
you
say
shall
we
match
weapon
against
weapon
watson
slowly
opened
his
eyes
the
blinding
light
had
dimmed
to
a
soft
glow
they
were
in
a
sort
of
gallery
whose
length
was
uncertain
between
him
and
the
outlet
about
ten
feet
away
stood
the
confident
bar
you
or
i
said
he
jauntily
are
you
ready
to
try
it
i
have
given
you
a
fair
chance
he
raised
his
weapon
as
though
aiming
it
at
the
same
instant
chick
pulled
the
trigger
from
the
hip
snap
aim
the
gun
was
empty
another
second
and
watson
would
have
been
like
those
spots
of
colour
on
the
ground
outside
he
breathed
a
prayer
to
his
maker
the
weapon
was
in
line
with
his
throat
but
it
was
not
to
be
there
came
a
flash
and
a
stunning
report
the
deherer
clattered
against
the
wall
and
the
senestro
clutched
a
stinging
hand
he
was
staring
in
surprise
at
something
behind
chick
something
that
made
him
turn
and
dart
out
of
sight
chick
wheeled
right
behind
him
stood
the
familiar
form
of
the
jan
lucar
and
a
few
feet
beyond
a
figure
from
which
came
a
clear
cool
nonchalant
voice
i
would
have
killed
that
fellow
chick
but
he
too
damned
handsome
i
going
to
save
him
for
a
watson
peered
closer
he
gave
a
gasp
half
of
amazement
half
of
delight
for
the
words
were
in
english
and
the
voice
it
was
harry
wendel
xliv
holcomb
story
if
there
was
the
least
doubt
in
chick
mind
that
this
was
really
harry
it
was
dispelled
by
the
sight
of
the
person
who
the
next
moment
stepped
up
to
his
side
it
was
none
other
than
the
nervina
harry
wendel
gasped
watson
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
surest
thing
you
know
chick
it
me
alive
and
kicking
as
they
grabbed
one
another
how
did
you
get
here
search
me
ask
the
lady
i
just
a
creature
of
circumstance
i
merely
act
she
does
all
the
the
nervina
smiled
and
nodded
her
eyes
were
just
as
wonderful
as
chick
remembered
them
full
of
elusiveness
of
the
moonbeam
light
of
witchery
past
understanding
yes
she
affirmed
you
see
watson
it
is
the
will
of
the
prophet
harry
is
of
the
chosen
we
have
come
for
the
great
holcomb
for
the
jarados
and
she
led
the
way
watson
followed
in
silent
wonder
behind
him
came
the
geos
and
the
rest
quiet
and
reverent
the
soft
glow
still
held
so
that
they
seemed
to
be
walking
through
the
walls
of
cold
fire
at
the
end
of
the
passage
they
came
to
a
door
the
nervina
touched
three
unmarked
spots
on
the
walls
the
door
opened
the
queen
stood
aside
and
motioned
for
chick
and
harry
to
enter
it
was
a
long
room
and
fitted
up
like
the
most
elaborate
sort
of
laboratory
and
at
the
far
end
seated
in
the
midst
of
a
strange
array
of
crystals
retorts
and
unfamiliar
apparatus
was
a
man
whom
the
two
instantly
recognised
it
was
the
missing
professor
looking
just
as
they
remembered
him
from
the
days
when
they
sat
in
his
class
in
berkeley
there
was
the
same
trim
figure
the
same
healthy
cheeks
pleasant
eyes
and
white
beard
always
there
had
been
something
imperturbable
about
the
doctor
he
had
that
poise
and
equanimity
which
is
ever
the
balance
of
sound
judgment
neither
chick
nor
harry
expected
any
rush
of
emotion
and
they
were
not
disappointed
holcomb
rose
to
his
feet
revealing
on
the
table
before
him
a
queer
dancing
light
which
he
had
been
studying
he
touched
something
the
light
vanished
and
simultaneously
there
came
an
unnameable
change
in
the
appearance
of
certain
of
those
puzzling
crystals
the
doctor
stepped
forward
hand
extended
smiling
surely
he
did
not
look
or
act
like
a
prisoner
well
well
spoke
he
at
last
chick
watson
and
harry
wendel
very
welcome
was
it
a
long
journey
his
eyes
twinkled
in
the
old
way
he
did
wait
for
their
replies
he
went
on
have
we
solved
the
blind
spot
it
seems
that
my
pupils
never
desert
me
let
me
ask
have
you
solved
the
blind
spot
we
solved
nothing
professor
what
we
have
come
for
is
first
yourself
and
second
for
the
secrets
you
have
found
it
is
for
us
to
ask
what
is
the
blind
spot
the
professor
shook
his
head
you
were
always
a
poor
guesser
wendel
perhaps
chick
now
put
me
down
as
unprepared
answered
chick
i
like
harry
i
want
to
know
perhaps
there
are
a
lot
of
us
in
the
same
fix
laughed
holcomb
we
who
know
more
than
any
men
who
ever
lived
want
to
know
still
more
it
may
be
after
all
that
we
know
very
little
even
though
we
have
solved
the
his
eyes
twinkled
again
aggravatingly
tell
us
then
from
harry
on
impulse
as
always
what
is
the
blind
spot
but
holcomb
shook
his
head
not
just
now
harry
we
have
the
geos
and
the
jan
had
entered
besides
i
am
not
quite
ready
there
remain
several
tangles
to
be
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
geos
he
spoke
in
the
thomahlian
tongue
you
are
more
than
the
rhamda
bent
low
in
reverence
and
awe
his
voice
was
hushed
he
spoke
art
thou
the
jarados
my
lord
aye
stated
the
doctor
i
am
he
i
am
the
jarados
it
was
a
stagger
for
both
young
men
neither
could
reconcile
the
great
professor
of
his
schooldays
with
this
strange
philosophic
prophet
of
the
occult
thomahlians
what
was
the
connection
what
was
the
fate
that
was
leading
urging
compelling
it
all
professor
you
will
pardon
our
eagerness
both
harry
and
i
have
had
adventures
without
understanding
what
it
was
all
about
ca
you
explain
where
are
we
and
why
and
then
your
lecture
on
the
blind
spot
you
promised
it
to
us
can
you
deliver
it
now
the
professor
smiled
his
acknowledgement
part
of
it
he
said
enough
to
answer
your
questions
to
some
extent
had
i
stayed
in
berkeley
i
could
have
delivered
it
all
but
and
he
laughed
i
know
a
whole
lot
more
now
and
paradoxically
i
know
far
less
first
let
me
speak
to
the
he
learned
that
the
struggle
outside
had
terminated
successfully
for
the
rhamda
and
his
men
all
was
quiet
the
senestro
had
made
his
escape
in
safety
back
to
the
mahovisal
the
doctor
ordered
that
he
was
not
to
be
molested
the
geos
and
the
others
left
the
room
escorting
the
aradna
who
was
too
exhausted
for
further
experiences
there
remained
with
the
doctor
chick
harry
and
the
nervina
i
will
reduce
that
lecture
to
synopsis
form
began
the
professor
i
shall
tell
you
all
that
i
know
up
to
this
moment
first
however
let
me
show
you
he
indicated
the
table
from
which
he
had
risen
chief
among
the
objects
on
its
top
were
fragments
of
minerals
some
familiar
some
strange
above
and
on
all
sides
were
the
crystal
globes
or
at
least
what
chick
named
as
such
erected
upon
as
many
tripods
one
of
these
the
professor
moved
toward
the
table
simultaneously
a
tiny
dot
appeared
on
a
small
metal
plate
in
the
centre
of
the
table
at
first
almost
invisible
it
grew
after
a
minute
or
so
to
a
definite
bit
of
matter
the
professor
moved
the
tripod
away
nearby
crystals
inside
of
which
some
dull
lights
had
leaped
into
momentary
being
subsided
into
quiescence
and
the
three
observers
looked
again
and
again
at
the
solid
fragment
of
material
that
had
grown
before
their
eyes
on
that
table
something
had
been
made
out
of
nothing
the
doctor
picked
it
up
and
held
it
unconcernedly
in
his
fingers
can
anybody
tell
me
asked
he
what
this
is
there
was
no
answer
the
professor
tossed
the
thing
back
on
the
table
it
gave
forth
a
sharp
metallic
sound
you
are
looking
at
ether
spoke
he
it
is
the
ether
itself
nothing
else
you
call
it
matter
others
would
call
it
iron
but
those
are
merely
names
i
call
it
ether
in
motion
materialised
vibration
like
everything
else
in
the
universe
it
answers
to
a
law
it
has
its
reason
there
is
no
such
thing
as
chance
do
you
follow
that
fragment
is
simply
a
principle
allowed
to
manifest
itself
through
a
natural
law
try
to
follow
me
all
is
out
of
the
ether
all
variety
in
matter
is
simply
a
question
of
varying
degrees
of
electronic
activity
depending
upon
a
number
of
ratios
life
itself
as
well
as
materiality
and
force
comes
out
of
the
ether
this
object
here
touching
the
crystal
is
merely
a
conductor
it
picks
up
the
ether
and
sends
it
through
a
set
degree
of
vibrational
activity
result
it
makes
iron
if
you
wish
you
may
go
back
to
our
twentieth
century
for
a
parallel
by
which
i
mean
electricity
it
is
gathered
crudely
but
the
time
will
come
when
it
will
be
picked
up
out
of
the
air
in
precisely
the
same
manner
that
men
pick
hydrocarbons
out
of
petroleum
or
as
i
sift
the
desired
quality
of
ether
through
that
globe
this
i
am
convinced
is
one
of
the
fundamental
secrets
of
the
blind
spot
is
there
any
question
wendel
managed
to
put
one
you
said
in
the
twentieth
century
is
it
a
question
of
time
displacement
sir
suppose
we
forgo
that
point
at
present
you
will
note
however
that
the
thomahlian
world
is
certainly
far
in
advance
of
our
professor
asked
watson
is
it
the
occult
ah
brightening
now
we
are
getting
back
to
the
old
point
however
what
is
the
occult
he
paused
then
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
the
occult
might
prove
to
be
the
real
world
proving
that
life
we
have
known
to
be
merely
a
shadow
silence
greeted
this
the
professor
went
on
let
me
ask
you
are
you
living
in
a
real
world
now
or
an
unreal
one
there
was
no
response
it
is
of
course
a
reality
just
as
truly
as
if
you
were
in
san
francisco
so
very
distinctly
perhaps
it
is
merely
a
question
of
viewpoint
as
to
which
is
the
occult
just
what
we
want
to
know
from
harry
and
that
tossing
up
his
hands
is
exactly
what
i
can
not
tell
you
i
have
found
out
many
things
but
i
can
not
be
sure
i
left
certainty
in
berkeley
today
i
feel
that
there
is
some
great
fate
some
unknown
force
that
defies
analysis
defies
all
attempts
at
resolution
a
force
that
is
driving
me
through
the
role
of
the
jarados
we
are
all
a
part
of
the
prophecy
we
must
wait
for
the
last
day
for
our
answer
that
prophecy
must
and
will
be
fulfilled
and
on
that
day
we
shall
have
the
key
to
the
blind
spot
we
shall
know
the
where
of
the
he
took
a
sip
from
a
tumbler
of
the
familiar
green
fluid
now
that
i
have
told
you
this
much
i
am
going
back
to
the
beginning
i
too
have
had
adventures
how
did
i
come
to
discover
the
blind
spot
it
was
about
one
year
prior
to
my
last
lecture
at
the
university
at
the
time
i
had
been
doing
much
work
all
of
which
you
know
and
out
of
it
i
had
adduced
some
peculiar
theories
for
example
undoubtedly
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
spirit
world
if
all
the
mediums
but
one
were
dishonest
and
that
one
produced
the
results
that
be
explained
away
by
psychology
then
we
must
admit
the
existence
of
another
world
but
reason
tells
us
that
there
is
nothing
but
reality
that
if
there
were
a
spirit
world
it
must
be
just
as
real
just
as
substantial
as
our
own
moreover
somewhere
somehow
here
must
be
a
definite
point
of
contact
that
was
approximately
my
theory
of
course
i
had
no
idea
how
close
i
had
come
to
a
great
truth
to
some
extent
it
was
pure
guesswork
then
one
day
budge
kennedy
brought
me
the
blue
stone
he
told
me
its
history
and
he
maintained
that
it
was
lighter
than
air
which
of
course
i
disbelieved
until
i
took
it
out
of
the
ring
and
saw
for
myself
i
went
at
once
to
the
house
at
chatterton
place
there
i
found
an
old
lady
who
had
lived
in
the
house
for
some
time
i
asked
to
see
the
cellar
where
the
stone
had
been
unearthed
understand
i
had
no
idea
of
the
great
discovery
i
was
about
to
make
i
merely
wanted
to
see
and
i
found
something
almost
as
impossible
as
the
blue
stone
green
one
heavier
than
any
known
mineral
answering
to
no
known
classification
but
of
an
entirely
new
element
it
was
no
larger
than
a
pea
but
of
incredible
weight
coming
upstairs
i
found
the
old
lady
a
bit
perturbed
i
had
told
her
my
name
she
had
recognised
me
as
well
with
me
she
said
with
that
she
opened
a
door
she
was
very
old
and
very
uncertain
yet
she
was
scarcely
afraid
there
she
said
and
pointed
through
the
door
i
entered
an
ordinary
room
furnished
as
a
parlour
there
was
a
sofa
a
table
a
few
chairs
little
else
do
you
mean
i
asked
man
man
what
man
she
exclaimed
came
here
one
night
when
the
moon
was
shining
he
sat
down
on
the
doorstep
he
was
just
the
kind
of
a
lad
that
in
need
of
a
mother
so
i
asked
him
to
lie
on
the
sofa
he
was
tired
you
see
and
i
once
had
a
son
of
my
own
she
stopped
and
it
was
a
moment
before
she
continued
i
could
feel
the
pressure
of
her
hand
on
my
arm
pitiful
beseeching
i
took
him
in
there
in
there
see
on
that
sofa
i
saw
it
they
took
him
oh
sir
it
was
terrible
she
was
weird
uncanny
strangely
interesting
just
lay
down
there
i
was
standing
by
the
door
when
they
took
him
i
could
understand
sir
i
saw
the
blue
light
and
the
moon
it
was
gone
and
then
she
looked
up
at
me
again
and
whispered
then
i
heard
a
bell
a
very
beautiful
bell
a
church
bell
sir
but
you
know
do
you
you
are
the
great
holcomb
that
why
you
went
into
the
cellar
was
it
because
you
know
her
manner
as
much
as
her
story
impressed
me
i
said
must
give
this
room
a
careful
examination
would
you
be
good
enough
to
leave
me
to
myself
she
closed
the
door
after
her
i
had
the
green
stone
in
my
hand
it
was
very
heavy
and
i
placed
it
on
one
of
the
chairs
the
blue
stone
i
still
held
at
the
moment
i
had
the
least
notion
of
what
was
about
to
happen
it
was
all
accident
from
beginning
to
end
all
of
a
sudden
the
room
disappeared
that
is
the
side
wall
i
was
not
looking
at
the
dingy
old
wallpaper
but
out
through
and
into
an
immense
building
dim
vast
and
immeasurable
directly
in
front
of
me
was
a
white
substance
like
a
stone
of
snow
upon
this
substance
was
seated
a
man
about
my
own
age
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
he
looked
up
just
as
i
noted
him
our
recognition
was
mutual
immediately
he
made
a
sign
with
one
hand
and
at
once
i
took
a
step
forward
i
thought
he
had
motioned
it
was
all
so
real
and
natural
though
his
features
were
dim
he
could
not
have
been
more
than
ten
feet
distant
but
at
that
very
instant
when
i
made
that
one
step
the
whole
thing
vanished
i
was
still
in
the
room
at
chatterton
place
that
what
started
it
all
had
this
occurred
to
any
one
else
in
the
world
i
should
have
labelled
it
an
unaccountable
illusion
but
it
had
happened
to
me
i
had
my
theory
between
the
spiritual
and
the
material
there
must
be
a
point
of
contact
and
i
had
found
it
i
had
discovered
the
road
to
the
indies
to
the
occult
to
all
that
other
men
call
unknowable
and
i
called
it
the
blind
xlv
the
aradna
thus
had
the
professor
got
into
actual
touch
with
the
occult
by
sheer
accident
up
to
that
time
it
had
been
only
a
hypothesis
now
it
was
a
fact
next
step
was
to
open
up
direct
communication
that
was
difficult
to
begin
with
i
worked
to
repeat
the
phenomena
i
had
seen
getting
some
haphazard
results
from
the
start
my
purpose
throughout
was
to
exchange
intelligent
comment
with
the
individual
i
had
beheld
on
that
within
the
spot
and
in
the
end
i
succeeded
he
gave
me
fairly
explicit
warning
as
to
when
the
blind
spot
should
open
not
only
to
the
eye
but
in
its
entirety
as
it
had
done
for
the
young
man
of
whom
the
old
lady
had
told
me
we
agreed
through
signs
that
he
would
come
through
first
understand
up
to
the
instant
of
his
actual
arrival
i
did
know
just
what
he
was
like
i
had
to
be
content
with
his
by
which
he
assured
me
he
was
a
real
man
material
of
life
and
the
living
i
made
my
announcement
you
know
most
of
what
followed
the
rhamda
came
to
berkeley
together
we
returned
to
chatterton
place
for
it
was
imperative
that
we
hold
the
spot
open
or
at
least
maintain
the
phenomenon
at
such
a
point
that
we
could
reopen
it
at
will
both
of
us
were
guessing
neither
of
us
knew
at
the
time
just
how
long
the
rhamda
could
endure
our
atmosphere
he
had
risked
his
life
to
come
through
it
was
no
more
than
fair
that
i
should
accede
to
his
caution
and
insure
him
a
safe
return
to
his
own
world
but
things
went
wrong
it
was
ignorance
as
much
as
accident
at
chatterton
place
i
was
caught
in
the
blind
spot
and
without
a
particle
of
preparation
was
tossed
into
the
thomahlia
when
i
came
through
the
nervina
went
out
thus
i
found
myself
in
this
strange
place
with
no
one
to
guide
me
and
unfortunately
or
rather
fortunately
i
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
bar
senestro
now
for
all
that
he
is
a
sceptic
the
senestro
is
a
brave
man
and
like
many
another
unbeliever
he
has
a
sense
of
humour
my
coming
had
been
promised
by
avec
so
he
knew
that
somehow
i
was
a
part
of
the
prophecy
the
prophecy
which
for
reasons
of
his
own
he
did
not
want
fulfilled
so
he
isolated
me
here
in
the
house
of
the
jarados
a
bold
sort
of
humor
i
call
it
to
defy
the
prophecy
in
the
very
spot
where
it
was
written
but
it
was
fortunate
i
was
in
the
house
of
the
old
prophet
with
its
stores
of
wisdom
secrets
raw
elements
and
means
for
applying
the
laws
of
nature
all
that
i
hitherto
had
only
guessed
at
i
now
had
at
my
disposal
libraries
laboratories
everything
i
was
a
recluse
with
no
interruptions
and
perfect
facility
for
study
first
of
all
i
went
into
their
philosophy
then
into
their
science
and
afterwards
into
their
history
whereupon
i
made
a
rather
startling
discovery
apparently
i
am
the
jarados
for
my
coming
had
been
foretold
almost
to
the
hour
as
i
went
on
with
the
research
i
found
many
other
points
that
seemed
familiar
plainly
there
was
something
that
had
led
me
into
the
spot
and
most
certainly
it
was
not
mere
chance
i
became
convinced
that
not
merely
my
own
destiny
but
a
higher
a
transcendental
fate
was
at
stake
in
the
course
of
time
i
became
certain
of
this
meanwhile
i
mastered
most
of
the
secrets
of
this
palace
the
wisdom
of
the
ancient
jarados
though
a
prisoner
i
was
the
happiest
of
men
which
i
still
remain
the
bars
kept
close
watch
over
me
constantly
changing
their
guard
and
it
was
on
one
of
those
occasions
that
i
found
macpherson
well
after
macpherson
coming
i
was
pretty
much
my
own
master
i
induced
the
senestro
to
allow
macpherson
to
remain
as
a
constant
bodyguard
but
i
never
told
pat
what
was
what
except
that
some
day
we
should
extricate
ourselves
you
may
wonder
why
i
did
not
open
the
spot
there
were
several
reasons
first
in
the
nature
of
the
phenomenon
it
must
be
opened
only
on
the
earth
side
except
on
rare
occasions
when
certain
conditions
are
peculiarly
favourable
that
why
the
rhamda
avec
could
not
do
it
alone
i
know
now
that
i
should
have
imparted
to
him
certain
technicalities
i
possessed
two
of
the
keys
then
now
i
know
there
are
three
and
i
have
learned
that
each
of
these
is
a
sinister
thing
the
blue
stone
for
instance
is
life
and
it
is
male
rather
a
sweeping
and
ambiguous
statement
but
you
will
comprehend
it
in
the
end
were
a
man
to
wear
it
it
would
kill
him
in
time
but
a
woman
can
wear
it
with
impunity
perhaps
you
will
appreciate
that
statement
better
if
you
note
what
i
have
just
done
through
the
medium
of
that
crystal
the
blue
gem
is
an
inductor
of
the
ether
in
a
sense
it
is
one
of
the
anchors
of
the
spot
of
life
or
the
blind
spot
whatever
we
want
to
call
it
the
spot
of
contact
the
other
two
particles
the
red
and
the
green
one
are
respectively
the
soul
and
the
material
or
let
us
say
the
etheric
embryos
of
these
essentials
the
three
stones
constitute
an
eternal
trinity
as
for
the
substance
of
the
spot
itself
that
i
can
not
tell
just
yet
but
i
do
know
that
the
whole
truth
will
come
out
clear
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophecy
i
am
convinced
that
it
has
translated
watson
and
now
harry
wendel
and
the
can
you
control
it
asked
chick
to
a
limited
extent
i
have
been
able
to
watch
you
ever
since
your
coming
you
did
not
know
about
harry
but
i
saw
him
come
in
the
arms
of
the
the
nervina
nodded
it
is
so
i
knew
the
senestro
i
was
afraid
that
harry
would
fall
into
his
hands
i
had
previously
endeavoured
to
have
him
give
the
jewel
to
charlotte
fenton
i
did
trust
the
great
bar
harry
interrupted
only
because
of
her
distrust
of
the
senestro
did
she
decide
to
come
through
the
blind
spot
with
me
she
knew
what
to
do
as
soon
as
we
got
here
she
bundled
me
off
privately
nursed
me
back
to
health
if
not
strength
and
when
the
time
came
rushed
me
up
here
at
the
last
second
to
be
in
at
the
watson
thought
of
the
dog
queen
she
also
had
come
through
just
in
time
to
save
his
life
did
harry
know
anything
about
her
when
wendel
had
related
what
he
knew
chick
commented
it
almighty
strange
harry
everything
works
out
to
fit
in
exactly
with
that
confounded
prophecy
perhaps
that
accounts
for
your
affinity
for
the
nervina
it
is
something
beyond
your
control
or
hers
have
to
wait
and
there
was
not
long
to
wait
the
days
passed
the
palace
was
full
of
rhamdas
summoned
by
holcomb
who
as
the
jarados
himself
was
now
issuing
orders
concerning
the
great
day
the
last
of
the
sixteen
days
now
very
close
at
hand
the
day
which
the
rhamdas
constantly
alluded
to
as
the
day
of
the
senestro
went
unmolested
returning
to
the
mahovisal
he
worked
now
to
further
the
truths
of
the
prophecy
still
the
millions
continued
to
descend
upon
the
mahovisal
coming
from
the
furthermost
parts
of
the
thomahlia
the
pilgrims
aircraft
kept
the
air
above
the
city
constantly
alive
there
were
days
such
as
no
man
had
ever
known
even
the
rhamdas
trained
to
composure
gave
evidence
of
the
strain
the
atmosphere
was
tense
charged
with
expectancy
and
hope
a
whole
world
was
coming
to
what
it
conceived
as
its
judgment
and
its
end
and
the
spot
of
life
was
the
blind
spot
at
last
the
doctor
summoned
the
two
young
men
it
was
night
and
the
june
bug
was
waiting
this
time
the
geos
himself
was
at
the
controls
we
are
going
to
the
mahovisal
spoke
the
doctor
to
the
temple
of
the
bell
and
leaf
there
is
still
something
i
must
know
before
the
he
was
speaking
english
if
we
can
bring
the
prophecy
to
pass
just
so
far
and
no
farther
we
shall
be
able
to
extricate
ourselves
nicely
anyway
i
think
we
shall
not
return
to
the
palace
of
he
held
a
black
leather
case
in
his
hand
he
touched
it
with
a
finger
if
this
little
case
and
its
contents
get
through
the
blind
spot
it
will
advance
civilisation
our
civilisation
about
a
so
remember
whatever
happens
to
me
be
sure
and
remember
this
case
it
must
go
through
the
spot
he
said
no
more
but
took
his
seat
beside
the
geos
the
young
men
took
the
rear
seats
in
a
short
time
they
had
crossed
the
great
range
of
mountains
and
were
hovering
over
the
mahovisal
there
was
no
sound
though
the
city
was
packed
with
untold
millions
the
tension
was
such
that
scarcely
a
murmur
came
out
of
the
metropolis
the
air
was
magnetic
charged
strained
close
to
the
breaking
point
above
all
the
reverence
for
the
last
day
and
the
hope
rising
accumulating
to
the
final
supreme
moment
for
the
sixteenth
day
was
now
only
hours
removed
both
chick
and
harry
realised
that
their
lives
were
at
stake
the
doctor
had
made
that
clear
in
the
last
minute
in
the
final
crisis
they
must
crowd
their
way
through
the
blind
spot
only
the
professor
knew
how
it
was
to
be
done
at
the
temple
they
found
the
nervina
and
the
aradna
waiting
the
jan
lucar
was
with
them
the
geos
had
secured
entrance
by
a
side
door
from
it
they
could
look
out
themselves
unobserved
over
the
entire
building
and
upon
the
spot
of
life
the
place
was
packed
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people
standing
in
silent
awe
and
worship
one
and
all
gazing
toward
the
spot
there
was
no
sound
save
the
whisper
of
multitudinous
breathing
said
harry
to
chick
i
see
queen
up
there
harry
circled
the
group
and
bounded
up
the
great
stairs
in
a
moment
he
was
patting
his
dog
head
she
looked
up
and
wagged
her
tail
to
show
her
pleasure
but
she
was
not
effusive
somehow
she
was
just
like
his
old
shepherd
she
glanced
at
him
and
then
out
at
the
concourse
below
and
lolled
her
tongue
expectantly
then
she
settled
back
into
her
place
and
resumed
watch
exactly
as
any
of
her
kind
would
have
held
guard
over
a
band
of
sheep
the
dog
was
serious
afterward
wendel
said
he
had
a
dim
notion
that
she
was
no
longer
a
dog
at
all
but
a
mere
instrument
in
the
hand
of
fate
what
the
matter
old
girl
he
asked
do
you
like
for
answer
she
gave
a
low
whine
she
looked
up
again
and
out
into
the
throng
she
repeated
the
whine
with
a
little
whimper
at
the
end
harry
returned
to
the
others
nothing
was
said
of
what
he
had
done
at
once
the
geos
led
the
group
through
a
small
door
beyond
which
was
a
narrow
winding
stairway
of
stone
the
geos
halted
dost
wish
the
building
emptied
o
jarados
i
do
when
we
come
back
from
under
the
spot
of
life
we
should
have
the
place
to
accompanied
by
the
two
queens
the
rhamda
returned
to
the
main
body
of
the
temple
holcomb
harry
and
chick
were
left
to
themselves
the
professor
took
out
a
notebook
in
it
was
traced
a
map
or
chart
together
with
several
notations
the
three
of
us
said
he
are
going
to
take
a
look
at
the
under
side
of
the
blind
spot
this
stairway
leads
into
a
secret
chamber
inside
the
foundations
of
the
great
stair
and
according
to
this
data
i
found
in
the
palace
together
with
some
calculations
of
my
own
we
ought
to
find
some
of
the
secrets
of
the
he
led
the
way
up
the
steps
at
the
top
of
the
flight
they
came
to
a
blank
blue
wall
there
was
no
sign
of
a
door
but
in
the
front
of
the
wall
stood
a
low
platform
in
the
centre
of
which
was
set
a
strange
red
stone
the
professor
consulted
his
chart
then
opened
his
black
case
from
it
he
took
another
stone
red
like
the
other
but
not
so
intense
this
he
touched
to
the
first
and
waited
inside
a
minute
a
light
sprang
up
from
the
contact
immediately
harry
and
chick
beheld
something
they
had
not
seen
on
the
wall
a
knob
or
button
the
doctor
pulled
sharply
on
it
instantly
a
door
opened
in
the
wall
they
passed
into
another
room
it
was
not
a
large
place
about
thirty
feet
across
perhaps
and
with
a
low
ceiling
from
all
sides
a
soft
intrinsic
glow
was
given
off
there
were
no
furnishings
but
in
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
occupying
almost
all
the
space
overhead
a
substance
hung
as
if
suspended
were
it
not
for
its
colour
and
its
size
it
might
have
been
likened
to
an
immense
horizontal
grindstone
hung
in
with
apparently
nothing
to
hold
it
there
around
its
side
they
could
make
out
a
narrow
gap
between
it
and
the
ceiling
and
directly
along
its
lower
edge
was
a
series
of
small
fiery
jewels
inset
and
of
the
order
and
colour
of
the
sign
of
the
jarados
red
blue
and
green
alternating
the
professor
produced
an
electric
torch
and
held
it
up
to
show
that
the
gap
between
the
stone
and
the
ceiling
was
unbroken
at
any
point
then
he
counted
the
jewels
on
the
lower
edge
chick
made
out
three
were
missing
from
their
sockets
all
told
then
there
should
have
been
the
doctor
noted
the
positions
of
the
three
empty
sockets
and
drawing
a
tapeline
from
his
pocket
proceeded
to
measure
the
distances
from
each
of
the
three
they
were
widely
separated
round
the
circle
from
each
other
then
he
turned
to
chick
and
harry
do
you
know
where
we
are
under
the
spot
of
life
it
was
easy
to
answer
you
are
in
san
francisco
not
in
in
chick
hesitated
yes
exactly
this
is
chatterton
place
the
house
of
the
blind
he
paused
for
them
to
digest
this
then
harry
did
you
say
hobart
fenton
was
with
you
on
that
last
night
hobart
and
his
sister
charlotte
i
remember
their
coming
at
the
last
minute
they
were
too
late
the
professor
nodded
well
harry
the
chances
are
that
hobart
is
not
more
than
twenty
feet
away
at
the
present
moment
charlotte
may
be
sitting
right
there
pointing
to
a
spot
at
harry
side
this
very
instant
and
there
may
be
many
others
no
doubt
they
are
working
hard
to
solve
the
mystery
unfortunately
the
best
they
can
do
is
to
guess
we
hold
the
key
that
is
i
should
correct
that
statement
we
hold
the
knowledge
and
they
hold
the
the
keys
harry
wanted
to
know
more
the
professor
pointed
to
the
three
empty
sockets
in
the
great
white
stone
above
their
heads
these
three
missing
stones
are
the
keys
until
they
are
reset
we
can
not
control
the
spot
i
had
found
two
of
them
before
i
came
through
i
take
it
that
both
of
you
remember
the
blue
one
i
think
agreed
chick
that
neither
of
us
is
ever
likely
to
forget
it
eh
harry
the
professor
smiled
he
was
holding
the
light
up
to
the
at
a
spot
that
would
have
been
the
point
of
intersection
had
lines
been
drawn
from
the
three
missing
gems
and
the
resulting
triangle
centred
he
held
his
hand
up
to
the
substance
it
was
slightly
rough
at
that
point
as
though
it
had
been
frozen
then
he
ran
his
fingers
across
the
surrounding
surface
ah
he
exclaimed
i
thought
so
that
helps
considerably
chick
put
your
hand
up
here
what
do
you
feel
rough
said
chick
feeling
the
intersection
point
slightly
so
but
cold
and
and
now
feel
cool
and
magnetic
doctor
but
smooth
what
does
it
prove
let
see
do
you
understand
the
term
good
well
there
should
be
another
clue
not
similar
but
supplementary
or
rather
complementary
on
the
earth
side
perhaps
one
of
you
found
it
while
you
lived
in
that
the
professor
eyed
both
men
anxiously
did
either
of
you
find
a
stain
or
anything
of
that
sort
on
the
walls
ceiling
or
floor
of
any
room
there
both
shook
their
heads
well
there
ought
to
be
frowned
the
doctor
i
am
positive
that
should
we
return
now
we
could
locate
some
such
phenomenon
from
this
side
it
is
very
easy
to
account
for
it
simply
the
disintegrating
effect
of
the
current
constantly
impinging
at
the
point
of
contact
or
the
intersection
having
acted
on
this
side
it
must
have
left
some
mark
on
the
watson
was
still
running
his
hand
over
the
once
before
when
he
had
stood
barefooted
in
the
contest
with
the
senestro
he
had
noted
its
cold
magnetism
what
is
this
substance
professor
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
discover
i
would
call
it
neutral
element
for
want
of
a
more
exact
term
something
that
touches
both
aspects
of
the
both
aspects
of
the
spectrum
yes
as
nearly
as
the
limitations
of
my
vocabulary
will
permit
if
you
recall
i
showed
you
a
simple
experiment
the
other
day
in
the
palace
by
means
of
an
inductor
i
drew
out
the
iron
principle
from
the
ether
and
built
up
the
metal
only
it
was
not
precisely
iron
but
its
thomahlian
equivalent
had
you
been
on
the
earth
side
you
would
have
seen
nothing
at
all
not
even
myself
i
was
on
the
wrong
aspect
of
the
spectrum
also
you
see
here
the
jaradic
colours
the
crimson
green
and
blue
the
shades
between
the
iridescence
and
the
shadows
had
you
been
on
the
other
side
you
would
have
seen
one
of
them
they
are
not
precisely
our
own
colours
but
their
equivalents
on
this
side
of
the
spot
in
the
final
analysis
as
i
said
before
it
gets
down
to
ether
to
speed
and
vibration
and
still
at
last
to
the
perceptive
limitations
of
our
own
earthly
five
senses
just
stop
and
consider
how
limited
we
are
only
five
senses
why
even
insects
have
six
then
consider
that
all
matter
when
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
is
differentiated
and
condensed
ether
focused
into
various
mathematical
arrangements
as
numberless
as
the
particles
of
the
universe
of
these
our
five
senses
pick
out
a
very
small
proportion
indeed
this
is
one
way
to
account
for
the
blind
spot
it
may
be
merely
another
phase
of
the
spectrum
not
simply
the
unexplored
regions
of
the
or
the
but
a
region
with
what
we
normally
apprehend
and
making
itself
manifest
through
apertures
in
what
we
with
our
extremely
limited
think
to
be
a
continuous
spectrum
i
throw
out
the
idea
mainly
as
a
suggestion
it
is
not
necessarily
the
true
explanation
let
us
go
a
bit
farther
remember
we
are
still
upon
the
earth
and
that
we
are
still
in
san
francisco
although
all
the
while
we
are
also
in
the
mahovisal
this
is
chatterton
place
and
at
the
same
time
it
is
the
temple
of
the
bell
it
might
be
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
other
places
just
as
well
too
if
my
hypothesis
is
correct
which
we
shall
see
now
what
does
this
mean
simply
this
gentlemen
that
we
people
have
failed
to
grasp
the
true
meaning
of
the
word
we
look
out
toward
the
stars
fancying
that
only
in
unlimited
space
can
we
find
the
infinite
we
little
suspect
we
ourselves
are
infinity
it
is
only
our
five
senses
that
make
us
finite
as
soon
as
we
grasp
this
the
spiritual
realm
becomes
a
very
substantial
fact
we
begin
to
apprehend
the
occult
our
world
is
merely
a
highly
specialized
phase
of
infinity
material
or
spiritual
it
is
all
the
same
that
why
we
look
on
the
thomahlians
as
occult
and
why
they
consider
us
in
the
same
light
it
is
strictly
a
question
of
sense
perception
and
limitations
which
can
be
covered
by
the
word
viewpoint
that
is
all
it
amounts
to
there
is
no
such
thing
as
unreality
but
there
is
most
certainly
such
a
thing
as
relativity
and
all
life
is
real
of
course
i
knew
nothing
of
this
until
the
discovery
of
the
blind
spot
it
will
i
think
prove
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
events
in
history
it
will
silence
the
sceptics
and
form
a
bulwark
for
all
religion
and
it
will
make
us
all
appreciate
our
creator
the
the
professor
stopped
for
some
moments
there
was
silence
what
are
we
to
do
now
asked
harry
but
the
professor
chose
not
to
answer
with
his
tape
he
began
taking
a
fresh
series
of
measurements
with
reference
to
the
empty
sockets
and
one
particularly
brilliant
red
gem
which
seemed
to
be
number
one
in
the
circle
from
time
to
time
the
doctor
jotted
down
the
results
and
made
short
calculations
presently
he
said
that
ought
to
be
enough
now
suppose
we
at
that
instant
something
happened
harry
wendel
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
he
pointed
to
the
suspended
stone
it
was
moving
it
was
revolving
almost
imperceptibly
like
some
vast
wheel
turning
on
its
axis
so
slowly
did
it
rotate
the
motion
would
have
escaped
attention
were
it
not
for
the
gems
and
their
brilliance
suddenly
it
came
to
a
stop
short
and
quick
as
though
it
had
dropped
into
a
notch
and
from
above
they
heard
the
deep
solemn
clang
of
the
temple
bell
what
is
that
asked
harry
startled
who
moved
the
stone
can
it
be
flashed
chick
that
hobart
fenton
has
found
the
keys
that
remains
to
be
seen
from
the
doctor
come
we
must
find
out
what
has
happened
within
a
minute
they
knew
as
they
came
out
of
the
private
door
on
the
now
emptied
floor
of
the
great
temple
they
saw
the
senior
queen
the
nervina
coming
down
the
great
stairway
from
the
spot
of
life
what
is
it
called
harry
apprehensively
the
aradna
she
replied
her
voice
was
curiously
strained
something
happened
and
she
has
fallen
through
the
spot
xlvi
out
of
the
occult
how
did
it
happen
i
scarcely
know
we
went
up
to
play
with
the
dog
it
was
unwilling
to
leave
the
place
and
aradna
teasingly
tried
to
push
her
off
on
to
the
steps
she
succeeded
but
well
it
was
all
over
that
quick
the
aradna
was
gone
but
the
spot
had
by
this
time
lost
a
good
deal
of
its
terror
knowing
what
was
on
the
other
side
and
who
made
a
great
difference
as
the
doctor
said
later
in
a
private
consultation
with
chick
and
harry
it
not
so
bad
that
is
if
hobart
fenton
is
at
work
there
i
think
he
is
really
i
only
regret
that
we
did
know
of
this
beforehand
we
could
have
sent
a
message
through
to
and
the
professor
went
on
to
explain
what
he
meant
at
the
time
he
spoke
it
was
hours
after
the
aradna
going
another
hours
would
see
the
evening
of
the
last
day
the
sixteenth
of
the
sacred
days
of
life
what
the
rhamdas
alluded
to
as
the
day
of
and
the
mahovisal
was
a
seething
mass
of
humanity
all
bent
upon
seeing
the
fulfillment
of
their
highest
hopes
bear
in
mind
that
if
the
spot
should
not
open
at
the
last
moment
you
and
i
are
done
for
we
will
be
ones
our
lives
will
not
last
one
minute
after
midnight
tomorrow
night
if
we
fail
to
get
through
that
prophecy
means
everything
to
the
thomahlians
there
was
a
time
when
they
accepted
it
on
faith
now
it
is
an
intellectual
conviction
with
every
last
one
of
them
and
one
and
all
look
forward
to
a
new
and
glorious
life
beyond
the
spot
in
the
occult
world
our
world
now
the
ticklish
part
of
the
job
will
be
to
open
the
spot
just
long
enough
to
permit
us
to
get
through
yet
prevent
the
whole
prophecy
from
coming
to
pass
we
got
to
get
through
together
with
that
black
case
of
mine
and
then
shut
the
door
in
the
face
of
all
thomahlia
nothing
more
was
said
on
the
subject
until
late
the
following
afternoon
as
the
doctor
harry
and
chick
sat
down
to
a
light
meal
they
ate
much
as
if
nothing
whatever
was
in
the
wind
from
where
they
sat
in
one
part
of
a
wing
of
the
temple
they
could
look
out
into
the
crowded
streets
in
which
were
packed
untold
numbers
of
pilgrims
all
pressing
towards
the
great
square
plaza
in
front
of
the
temple
no
guards
were
to
be
seen
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
was
sufficient
to
keep
order
but
the
terrific
potentiality
of
that
host
did
not
cause
the
doctor
voice
to
change
one
iota
there
is
no
telling
what
may
happen
he
said
for
my
own
part
i
shall
not
venture
near
the
spot
of
life
until
just
at
the
end
i
shall
remain
in
the
chamber
underneath
but
you
two
ought
to
show
yourselves
immediately
after
sundown
certain
ancient
writings
indicate
it
you
and
the
nervina
will
have
to
mount
the
stair
to
the
spot
and
remain
in
sight
until
midnight
until
the
end
so
we
must
be
prepared
for
he
took
some
papers
from
his
pocket
and
selected
two
and
gave
one
to
each
of
his
pupils
here
are
the
details
of
what
must
be
done
in
case
only
one
of
us
gets
through
it
will
be
but
how
can
these
be
of
any
use
on
such
short
notice
harry
asked
cudgel
your
brains
a
bit
gentlemen
he
chided
you
will
soon
see
my
drift
this
is
one
of
those
occasions
when
the
psychic
elements
involved
are
such
that
without
doubt
it
were
best
if
you
reacted
naturally
to
whatever
may
happen
now
you
will
note
that
i
have
made
a
drawing
of
the
blind
spot
region
also
certain
calculations
which
will
explain
themselves
moreover
i
have
written
out
the
combination
to
my
laboratory
safe
in
my
house
in
berkeley
the
green
stone
is
there
bertha
will
help
as
soon
as
she
understands
that
it
is
my
wish
no
explanation
will
be
needed
you
may
leave
the
rest
to
me
young
gentlemen
act
as
through
you
had
no
notion
that
i
was
down
below
the
spot
i
shall
be
merely
experimenting
a
bit
with
that
circle
of
jewels
to
see
if
the
phenomena
which
affected
the
aradna
can
not
be
repeated
i
fancy
it
was
not
mere
accident
but
rather
the
working
of
a
he
said
no
more
about
this
except
to
comment
that
he
hoped
to
get
into
direct
communication
with
hobart
fenton
before
midnight
should
arrive
however
he
did
say
in
an
irrelevant
sort
of
manner
oh
by
the
way
do
either
of
you
happen
to
recall
which
direction
the
house
at
chatterton
place
faces
north
replied
harry
and
chick
almost
in
the
same
breath
ah
yes
well
the
temple
faces
south
can
you
remember
that
they
thought
they
could
the
rest
of
the
meal
was
eaten
without
any
discussion
just
as
they
arose
however
the
doctor
observed
it
may
be
that
hobart
fenton
has
got
to
come
through
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
his
mentality
it
largely
a
question
of
psychic
influence
the
combined
resultant
force
of
the
three
material
gems
and
the
three
degrees
of
psychic
vibration
as
put
forth
by
him
and
you
two
we
shall
see
something
happened
today
the
geos
told
me
about
it
which
may
link
up
hobart
very
definitely
it
was
about
one
when
one
of
the
temple
pheasants
began
to
behave
very
queerly
up
on
the
great
stair
it
had
been
walking
around
on
the
and
flying
a
bit
then
it
started
to
hop
down
the
steps
about
sixteen
steps
down
geos
says
the
pheasant
stopped
and
began
to
flutter
frantically
as
though
some
unseen
person
were
holding
it
suddenly
it
vanished
and
as
suddenly
reappeared
again
it
flew
off
unharmed
i
ca
quite
account
for
it
but
well
we
see
he
spoke
no
more
but
led
the
way
out
into
the
entrance
to
the
wing
there
they
waited
only
a
moment
or
two
before
the
nervina
and
her
retinue
arrived
without
delay
a
start
was
made
for
the
great
black
stairway
the
doctor
alone
remained
behind
there
was
a
lane
through
the
crowd
allowing
the
nervina
and
the
rest
access
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
reaching
that
point
she
paused
for
a
look
around
the
sun
had
just
gone
down
the
artificial
lights
of
the
temple
had
not
yet
been
turned
on
overhead
the
great
hung
portentously
even
more
ominous
than
in
the
brighter
light
the
huge
waterspout
columns
the
terrific
size
of
the
auditorium
were
none
the
less
impressive
for
the
incalculable
horde
that
filled
every
bit
of
floor
space
at
the
front
of
the
building
the
archway
gave
a
glimpse
of
the
vastly
greater
throng
waiting
outside
but
all
was
quiet
with
the
silence
of
reverence
and
supreme
expectation
the
long
flight
of
stairs
was
lined
on
either
side
from
bottom
to
top
with
the
rhamdas
on
the
landing
there
stood
only
two
of
the
three
chairs
that
chick
had
seen
on
the
previous
occasion
the
green
one
had
been
brought
down
and
placed
in
the
centre
of
an
open
spot
just
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
this
chair
sat
the
bar
senestro
deployed
about
him
at
a
respectful
distance
was
a
of
the
bars
many
hundreds
in
number
behind
the
bars
separating
them
from
the
crowds
at
their
backs
were
grouped
the
crimson
and
blue
guardsmen
among
them
no
doubt
were
the
jan
lucar
and
the
macpherson
but
chick
could
locate
neither
the
nervina
taking
harry
arm
ascended
the
steps
chick
followed
with
the
rhamda
geos
at
his
side
at
the
top
of
the
flight
the
nervina
was
escorted
to
one
of
the
chairs
while
chick
placed
the
geos
in
the
other
it
left
the
two
californians
on
their
feet
to
move
around
to
whatever
extent
seemed
commensurate
with
dignity
chick
drew
harry
aside
what
do
you
suppose
said
chick
indicating
the
handsome
confident
figure
in
the
chair
at
the
base
of
the
stairs
what
do
you
suppose
friend
senestro
is
thinking
about
harry
frowned
you
know
him
better
than
i
do
you
do
think
he
has
reformed
not
on
your
life
not
the
bar
he
merely
adjusted
his
plans
to
the
new
situation
he
sees
that
the
prophecy
is
likely
to
be
fulfilled
so
he
counts
on
being
the
first
to
get
through
after
the
nervina
then
whether
the
rest
of
the
thomahlia
follows
or
not
he
calls
himself
the
divinely
appointed
leader
now
i
understand
he
will
get
through
and
marry
the
two
queens
anyhow
perhaps
it
was
because
the
crowd
was
so
terrifically
large
or
there
may
have
been
something
in
the
destiny
of
things
that
would
not
permit
the
chief
actors
to
feel
nervous
certain
it
is
that
neither
of
the
two
men
experienced
the
least
stage
fright
had
they
been
on
display
before
a
crowd
the
size
anywhere
else
both
would
have
been
ill
at
ease
this
was
different
enormously
so
no
longer
was
there
any
circulation
in
the
crowd
people
remained
in
their
places
now
just
as
they
expected
the
end
to
find
them
chick
and
harry
marvelled
at
their
composure
strangely
in
contrast
with
the
ceaseless
activities
of
the
temple
pheasants
darting
everywhere
overhead
suddenly
harry
remarked
i
got
an
idea
chick
it
this
how
does
the
professor
expect
to
send
a
message
to
hobart
chick
could
not
guess
but
already
harry
had
taken
his
sheet
of
instructions
from
his
pocket
and
was
rolling
it
into
a
compact
pellet
then
he
went
to
queen
and
with
a
ribbon
borrowed
from
the
nervina
tied
the
message
tightly
to
the
dog
collar
hobart
will
be
certain
to
see
it
said
he
i
wonder
if
the
figured
it
out
yet
he
playing
with
a
tremendous
force
observed
chick
thoughtfully
he
reached
out
and
touched
the
with
his
foot
just
as
he
had
done
before
and
fancied
that
he
could
feel
that
electric
thrill
even
through
the
leather
of
his
shoes
still
it
worth
any
risk
he
may
be
taking
down
in
that
chamber
if
only
he
could
send
queen
through
hobart
he
never
finished
the
sentence
he
staggered
thrown
off
his
balance
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
resting
the
weight
of
one
foot
on
the
stone
and
it
moved
moved
shifted
about
its
axis
just
as
it
had
done
hours
previously
when
the
aradna
had
dropped
through
and
chick
had
only
a
flash
of
a
second
for
a
glimpse
of
the
startled
faces
of
harry
the
nervina
and
the
geos
the
huge
multitude
below
the
stair
queen
on
the
other
side
and
the
fateful
prophecy
on
the
walls
above
him
before
a
figure
came
into
existence
at
his
side
it
was
that
of
a
powerfully
built
man
on
whose
wrists
were
curious
red
circles
and
chick
shouted
in
a
great
voice
hobart
and
then
came
blackness
xlvii
the
last
leaf
watson
story
was
now
completed
during
the
entire
recital
his
auditors
had
spoken
scarcely
a
word
it
had
been
marvellous
almost
a
revelation
with
the
possible
exception
of
sir
henry
hodges
not
one
had
expected
that
it
would
measure
up
to
this
for
the
whole
thing
backed
up
holcomb
original
proposition
the
occult
is
certainly
if
what
watson
had
told
them
was
true
then
infinity
had
been
squared
by
itself
not
only
was
there
an
infinity
that
we
might
look
up
to
through
the
stars
but
there
was
another
just
as
great
here
upon
the
earth
the
occult
became
not
only
possible
but
unlimited
the
next
few
minutes
would
prove
whether
or
not
he
had
told
the
truth
it
was
now
close
to
midnight
jerome
and
general
hume
had
returned
from
berkeley
their
quest
had
been
successful
watson
now
had
the
missing
green
stone
a
number
of
soldiers
were
stationed
about
the
house
watson
noted
these
men
when
he
had
finished
his
account
and
said
good
we
may
need
them
although
i
hope
not
fortunately
the
spot
is
small
and
a
few
of
us
can
hold
it
against
a
good
many
what
we
must
do
is
to
extricate
our
friends
and
close
it
afterward
we
may
have
time
for
more
leisurely
investigation
but
we
must
remember
above
all
things
that
black
case
of
professor
holcomb
it
holds
the
secrets
now
i
must
ask
you
all
to
step
out
of
this
room
this
library
you
know
is
the
blind
he
directed
them
to
take
positions
along
the
balustrade
of
the
stairway
out
in
the
hall
through
the
wide
archway
where
they
could
have
a
clear
view
yet
be
safe
it
was
a
curious
test
with
nothing
but
his
mathematics
and
his
drawing
to
go
by
watson
was
about
to
set
the
three
stones
in
their
invisible
sockets
he
spread
the
map
out
carefully
likewise
his
calculations
they
gave
him
on
this
floor
the
precise
positions
that
he
charted
on
the
earth
of
the
cellar
a
glance
toward
the
front
of
the
house
north
then
a
little
measuring
three
on
the
carpet
and
he
was
ready
for
the
final
move
he
took
the
fateful
ring
and
with
a
penknife
pried
up
the
prongs
that
held
the
stone
as
it
popped
out
he
caught
it
with
one
hand
then
he
looked
at
the
row
of
wondering
faces
along
the
stair
i
think
it
will
work
he
said
but
remember
do
come
near
i
shall
get
out
as
best
i
can
myself
do
try
to
save
with
that
he
held
the
jewel
on
the
first
of
the
three
on
the
circumference
of
the
great
circle
he
held
it
tight
against
the
carpet
and
then
let
go
up
it
flashed
about
one
foot
and
disappeared
there
was
no
sound
next
watson
took
the
red
stone
with
it
the
process
was
inverted
instead
of
holding
it
to
the
floor
he
raised
it
as
high
as
he
could
reach
directly
above
the
second
mark
then
he
let
it
drop
it
did
not
reach
the
floor
it
fell
a
little
more
than
halfway
and
vanished
the
third
stone
the
green
one
was
still
remaining
watson
took
it
to
the
third
and
final
mark
on
the
circle
taking
care
to
keep
outside
the
circumference
that
marked
the
spot
this
mark
was
directly
in
front
of
the
archway
he
turned
to
them
watch
carefully
he
spoke
i
do
not
know
what
has
transpired
in
the
temple
during
the
past
few
hours
be
ready
for
anything
all
of
you
he
dropped
the
stone
with
the
same
motion
he
dodged
out
into
the
hall
though
there
was
no
sound
there
was
something
that
every
one
felt
a
sibilant
undertone
and
cold
vibration
a
tense
flash
of
magnetism
then
the
dot
of
blue
a
string
of
incandescence
just
as
had
been
spoken
the
blind
spot
was
opening
watson
silently
warned
the
others
to
remain
where
they
were
and
himself
crowded
back
against
the
stair
and
as
he
did
so
someone
came
noiselessly
down
the
steps
from
the
floor
above
passed
unnoticed
behind
the
watchers
and
thence
across
into
the
hall
it
was
a
slender
frail
figure
in
white
the
aradna
walking
like
one
in
the
grip
of
a
higher
will
before
they
could
make
a
move
she
had
stepped
into
the
blind
spot
under
the
dot
of
blue
and
into
a
string
of
light
and
then
she
was
gone
it
was
as
swift
as
a
guess
it
was
inexorable
and
unseen
and
being
unseen
close
akin
to
terror
the
group
watched
and
waited
scarcely
breathing
what
would
happen
next
there
came
a
sudden
jarring
click
like
the
tapping
of
iron
and
next
instant
the
spot
opened
to
human
sight
the
library
at
chatterton
place
was
gone
instead
the
people
on
the
stairs
were
gazing
down
from
the
spot
of
life
straight
into
the
colossal
temple
of
the
jarados
it
was
as
chick
had
described
it
immense
beyond
conception
through
the
great
doors
and
out
into
the
plaza
beyond
was
gathered
all
thomahlia
reverent
like
those
waiting
for
the
crack
of
doom
above
the
horde
high
on
the
opposite
wall
stood
out
the
monster
clover
leaf
of
the
jarados
blazing
like
liquid
fire
it
was
ominous
with
real
life
at
that
moment
the
whole
concourse
rippled
with
commotion
arms
were
uplifted
one
and
all
pointed
towards
the
dais
they
too
were
looking
through
the
spot
then
the
multitude
began
to
move
it
heaved
and
surged
and
rolled
toward
the
centre
the
guards
were
pressed
in
upon
the
bars
the
bars
upon
the
stair
there
was
no
resisting
that
flood
of
humanity
on
and
up
it
came
sweeping
everything
before
it
directly
in
the
foreground
lay
the
on
its
centre
stood
the
dog
queen
crouching
waiting
bristling
by
her
side
harry
wendel
crouched
on
one
knee
as
if
awaiting
the
signal
behind
him
the
nervina
supporting
the
awakening
aradna
and
in
front
of
all
the
powerful
bulk
of
hobart
fenton
standing
squarely
at
the
head
of
the
stair
ready
to
grapple
the
first
to
reach
the
landing
but
most
important
of
all
there
stood
the
doctor
himself
he
was
at
the
nervina
side
in
his
hand
the
case
of
priceless
data
he
was
gazing
through
the
spot
and
making
a
signal
of
some
kind
to
watson
whereupon
the
latter
leaped
to
the
edge
of
the
unseen
circle
something
had
gone
wrong
the
spot
was
not
fully
open
nothing
but
sight
could
get
through
yet
there
was
no
time
for
anything
up
the
stairs
came
the
bars
leading
and
being
pressed
forward
by
the
horde
at
their
head
dashed
the
bar
senestro
handsome
as
alexander
hobart
stepped
forward
to
meet
him
but
the
doctor
stopped
him
with
a
word
only
a
few
seconds
elapsed
between
death
and
salvation
again
holcomb
signed
to
watson
not
a
sound
came
through
watson
hesitated
the
dog
queen
shot
to
her
feet
then
the
senestro
all
the
rest
and
dodging
hobart
had
leaped
upon
the
dais
upon
the
wall
across
the
temple
the
great
leaf
of
the
jarados
stood
out
like
sinister
fire
it
pulsed
and
vibrated
alive
the
top
petal
the
blue
one
suddenly
broke
into
a
seething
wave
of
flame
still
watson
held
back
he
could
not
understand
what
holcomb
meant
queen
waited
only
until
the
senestro
set
foot
on
the
dais
she
crouched
then
leaped
it
was
done
with
a
lightning
shift
of
his
nimble
feet
the
bar
kicked
the
shepherd
in
the
side
caught
at
full
leap
she
was
knocked
completely
over
and
fell
upon
the
it
was
the
sacrilege
even
the
bars
beyond
the
senestro
stopped
in
horror
the
one
sacred
to
the
jarados
it
was
she
who
had
been
touched
had
the
senestro
undone
all
on
the
spot
of
judgment
what
would
be
the
end
fenton
acted
he
caught
the
senestro
before
he
could
get
his
balance
and
with
a
mighty
heave
hurled
him
over
the
side
of
the
stair
a
second
and
it
was
over
another
second
was
the
last
for
the
great
leaf
of
the
jarados
had
opened
the
green
and
red
stood
still
but
out
of
the
blue
came
a
dazzling
light
a
powerful
beam
so
brilliant
it
seemed
solid
it
shot
across
the
whole
sweep
of
the
temple
and
touched
the
prophecy
over
the
golden
scrolls
it
traced
its
marvellous
colour
until
it
came
to
the
lines
beware
ye
of
sacrilege
lest
i
take
from
ye
all
that
i
have
given
ye
and
the
day
be
postponed
beware
ye
of
sacrilege
for
a
moment
the
strange
light
stood
still
so
that
the
checked
millions
might
read
then
it
turned
upon
the
dais
there
it
spread
and
hovered
over
the
group
until
it
seemed
to
work
them
together
the
nervina
to
harry
the
aradna
to
hobart
not
one
of
them
knew
what
it
was
they
obeyed
by
impulse
it
was
their
destiny
the
chosen
and
the
queens
the
light
stopped
at
the
foot
of
holcomb
then
the
strangest
thing
happened
out
of
the
light
or
rather
from
where
it
bathed
the
snowstone
came
a
man
a
man
much
like
holcomb
bearded
and
short
and
kindly
he
was
the
real
jarados
unhesitatingly
the
professor
stepped
up
beside
him
then
followed
hobart
and
the
aradna
harry
and
the
nervina
and
lastly
from
the
crowd
of
bars
macpherson
the
whole
concourse
in
the
temple
stopped
in
awe
and
terror
only
for
a
second
then
the
jarados
and
all
at
his
side
were
gone
and
upon
the
there
stood
a
sword
of
living
flame
it
stood
there
for
just
a
breath
exactly
where
the
group
had
been
and
it
was
gone
that
was
all
no
not
quite
all
for
when
the
blind
spot
closed
that
night
at
chatterton
place
there
came
once
more
the
deep
solemn
peal
of
the
bell
of
the
jarados
xlviii
the
unaccountable
were
this
account
merely
a
work
of
fiction
it
would
harmonise
things
so
as
to
have
no
unaccountables
in
it
as
it
is
the
present
writers
will
have
to
make
this
quite
clear
it
is
not
known
why
the
rhamda
avec
failed
to
show
himself
at
the
crucial
moment
perhaps
he
could
have
changed
everything
we
can
only
surmise
he
has
not
been
seen
or
heard
from
since
which
also
is
true
of
chick
watson
he
disappeared
immediately
after
the
closing
of
the
spot
saying
that
he
was
going
to
bertha
home
no
trace
has
been
found
of
either
to
date
doubtless
the
reader
has
noted
advertisement
in
the
papers
appealing
to
the
authorities
to
report
any
one
of
watson
description
applying
for
a
marriage
licence
as
for
his
two
friends
wendel
and
fenton
together
with
the
aradna
and
the
nervina
they
and
macpherson
and
the
doctor
absolutely
vanished
from
all
the
knowledge
either
of
the
thomahlia
or
the
earth
the
jarados
alone
can
tell
of
them
mme
le
fabre
however
feels
that
she
can
explain
the
matter
satisfactorily
abridged
her
theory
runs
there
is
but
one
way
to
explore
the
occult
that
way
is
to
die
for
all
that
we
were
so
strongly
impressed
with
the
reality
of
watson
i
am
firmly
convinced
that
he
was
simply
a
spirit
that
everything
we
saw
was
spirit
manifestation
dr
holcomb
and
all
the
rest
have
simply
gone
on
to
another
plane
we
shall
never
see
them
again
they
are
dead
no
other
explanation
will
hold
they
are
giving
this
version
to
the
public
strictly
for
what
it
is
worth
the
present
writers
feel
it
only
right
to
submit
the
conclusions
reached
by
malloy
and
concurred
in
by
drs
higgins
and
hansen
also
with
reservations
by
professor
herold
and
by
miss
clarke
to
a
certain
extent
and
up
to
a
certain
point
it
is
possible
to
account
for
the
astonishing
case
of
the
blind
spot
by
means
of
psychological
principles
hallucinations
will
cover
a
great
deal
of
ground
but
we
feel
that
our
personal
experiences
in
witnessing
the
interior
of
the
thomahlia
can
not
be
thus
explained
away
our
accounts
tally
too
exactly
and
we
are
not
subject
to
group
hypnosis
to
explain
this
we
believe
a
new
hypothesis
is
called
for
we
submit
that
what
we
saw
was
not
unreal
assuming
that
a
thing
is
real
or
unreal
and
can
never
be
in
a
third
state
which
is
neither
one
nor
the
other
then
we
should
have
to
insist
that
what
we
saw
was
real
we
stand
ready
and
prepared
to
accept
any
theory
which
will
fit
all
facts
not
merely
a
again
refraining
from
any
comment
we
pass
on
to
the
more
exhaustive
opinion
of
sir
henry
hodges
inasmuch
as
this
seems
to
coincide
very
closely
with
the
hypothesis
of
professor
holcomb
and
as
the
reputation
of
sir
henry
is
a
thing
of
weight
we
are
quoting
him
almost
verbatim
there
is
a
experiment
in
chemistry
wherein
equal
quantities
of
water
and
alcohol
are
mixed
let
us
say
a
pint
of
each
now
the
resulting
mixture
ought
to
be
a
quart
but
it
is
not
it
is
somewhat
less
than
a
quart
strange
indeed
to
the
novice
but
a
commonplace
to
every
student
of
the
subject
it
is
strange
only
that
except
for
holcomb
and
this
man
avec
science
has
overlooked
the
stupendous
significance
and
suggestion
of
this
particular
fact
now
consider
another
fact
no
matter
how
you
try
you
can
not
prevent
gravity
from
acting
it
will
pull
every
object
down
regardless
of
how
you
try
to
screen
it
from
the
earth
why
because
gravity
penetrates
all
things
again
why
why
should
gravity
penetrate
all
things
the
answer
is
because
gravity
is
a
function
of
the
ether
and
the
ether
is
an
imponderable
substance
so
impalpable
that
it
passes
right
through
all
solids
as
though
they
were
not
there
these
are
two
highly
suggestive
points
they
show
us
first
that
two
substances
can
exist
within
the
space
formerly
thought
to
be
completely
filled
by
one
second
they
show
that
all
substances
are
porous
to
the
ether
very
well
bear
in
mind
that
we
know
nothing
whatever
directly
about
the
ether
our
knowledge
is
all
indirect
therefore
it
may
be
that
there
is
more
than
one
ether
conceive
what
this
means
if
there
were
another
ether
how
could
we
become
aware
of
it
only
through
the
medium
of
some
such
phenomenon
as
the
blind
spot
not
through
ordinary
channels
for
the
ordinary
channels
are
microscopes
and
every
one
of
which
when
traced
to
the
ultimate
is
simply
a
concrete
expression
of
the
one
ether
we
know
in
the
nature
of
the
case
our
five
senses
could
never
apprehend
a
second
ether
yet
knowing
what
we
do
about
the
structure
of
the
atom
of
electronic
activity
of
quantels
we
must
admit
that
there
is
a
huge
unoccupied
space
that
is
we
ca
see
that
it
is
occupied
in
and
between
the
interstices
of
the
atom
it
is
in
the
region
mingled
and
intertwined
with
the
electrons
which
make
up
the
world
we
know
so
well
that
in
my
opinion
the
thomahlian
world
exists
it
is
actually
coexistent
with
our
own
it
is
here
and
so
are
we
at
this
very
instant
at
any
given
spot
there
can
be
and
almost
certainly
is
more
than
one
solid
object
two
systems
of
materiality
two
systems
of

two
systems
of
death

if
two
why
then
perhaps
there
are
even
more

charlotte
fenton
does
not
indulge
in
speculation
she
seems
to
bear
up
wonderfully
well
in
the
face
of
harry
wendel
affinity
for
the
nervina
and
also
in
the
face
of
her
brother
disappearance
and
she
philosophically
states
when
columbus
returned
from
his
search
for
the
east
indies
he
triumphantly
announced
that
he
had
found
what
he
sought
he
was
mistaken
he
had
found
something
else
america
it
may
be
that
we
are
all
mistaken
it
may
be
that
something
entirely
different
from
what
any
one
has
suspected
has
been
found
time
will
tell
i
am
willing
to
to
make
it
complete
it
is
felt
that
the
following
statement
of
general
hume
is
not
only
essential
but
convincing
to
the
last
degree
my
view
regarding
this
mystery
is
simply
this
i
have
eyes
and
i
have
seen
i
do
know
whether
the
actors
were
living
or
dead
i
am
no
scientist
i
have
no
theory
i
only
know
and
i
will
swear
to
what
i
saw
i
am
a
soldier
the
two
men
who
are
bringing
this
to
press
have
shown
me
their
copy
it
is
correct
