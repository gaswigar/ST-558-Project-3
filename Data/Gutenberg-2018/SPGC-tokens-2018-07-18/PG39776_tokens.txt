the
days
of
the
stuarts
kings
of
scotland
were
the
days
of
chivalry
and
romance
the
long
and
bloody
contest
that
the
nation
maintained
against
the
whole
power
of
england
for
the
recovery
of
its
independence
of
those
rights
which
had
been
most
unwarrantably
wrested
from
our
fathers
by
the
greatest
and
most
treacherous
sovereign
of
that
age
with
the
successful
and
glorious
issue
of
the
war
laid
the
foundation
for
this
spirit
of
heroism
which
appears
to
have
been
at
its
zenith
about
the
time
that
the
stuarts
first
acquired
the
sovereignty
of
the
realm
the
deeds
of
the
douglasses
the
randolphs
and
other
border
barons
of
that
day
are
not
to
be
equalled
by
any
recorded
in
our
annals
while
the
reprisals
that
they
made
upon
the
english
in
retaliation
for
former
injuries
enriched
both
them
and
their
followers
and
rendered
their
appearance
splendid
and
imposing
to
a
degree
that
would
scarcely
now
gain
credit
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
a
scottish
earl
then
to
visit
the
court
at
the
head
of
a
thousand
horsemen
all
splendidly
mounted
in
their
military
accoutrements
and
many
of
these
gentlemen
of
rank
and
family
in
court
and
camp
feats
of
arms
were
the
topic
of
conversation
and
the
only
die
that
stamped
the
character
of
a
man
of
renown
either
with
the
fair
the
monarch
or
the
chiefs
of
the
land
no
gentleman
of
noble
blood
would
pay
his
addresses
to
his
mistress
until
he
had
broken
a
spear
with
the
knights
of
the
rival
nation
surprised
a
or
driven
a
prey
from
the
kinsmen
of
the
piercies
the
musgraves
or
the
howards
as
in
all
other
things
that
run
to
a
fashionable
extremity
the
fair
sex
took
the
lead
in
encouraging
these
deeds
of
chivalry
till
it
came
to
have
the
appearance
of
a
national
mania
there
were
tournaments
at
the
castle
of
every
feudal
baron
and
knight
the
ploughmen
and
drivers
were
often
discovered
on
returning
from
the
fields
hotly
engaged
in
a
tilting
bout
with
their
goads
and
and
even
the
little
boys
and
maidens
on
the
village
green
each
well
mounted
on
a
crooked
stick
were
daily
engaged
in
the
combat
and
riding
rank
and
file
against
each
other
breaking
their
tiny
weapons
in
the
furious
onset
while
the
mimic
fire
flashed
from
their
eyes
then
was
the
play
of
and
begun
a
favourite
one
on
the
school
green
to
this
day
such
was
the
spirit
of
the
age
not
only
in
scotland
but
over
all
the
countries
of
southern
europe
when
the
romantic
incidents
occurred
on
which
the
following
tale
is
founded
it
was
taken
down
from
the
manuscript
of
an
old
curate
who
had
spent
the
latter
part
of
his
life
in
the
village
of
mireton
and
was
given
to
the
present
editor
by
one
of
those
tenants
who
now
till
the
valley
where
stood
the
richest
city
of
this
realm
there
were
once
a
noble
king
and
queen
of
scotland
as
many
in
that
land
have
in
this
notable
manner
does
old
isaac
the
curate
begin
his
narrative
it
will
be
seen
in
the
sequel
that
this
king
and
queen
were
robert
the
second
and
his
they
were
beloved
by
all
their
subjects
continues
he
and
loved
and
favoured
them
in
return
and
the
country
enjoyed
happiness
and
peace
all
save
a
part
adjoining
to
the
borders
of
england
the
strong
castle
of
roxburgh
which
was
the
key
of
that
country
had
been
five
times
taken
by
the
english
and
three
times
by
the
scots
in
less
than
seventeen
months
and
was
then
held
by
the
gallant
lord
musgrave
for
richard
king
of
england
our
worthy
king
had
one
daughter
of
exquisite
beauty
and
accomplishments
the
flower
of
all
scotland
and
her
name
was
margaret
this
princess
was
courted
by
many
of
the
principal
nobility
of
the
land
who
all
eagerly
sought
an
alliance
with
the
royal
family
not
only
for
the
additional
honour
and
power
which
it
conferred
on
them
and
their
posterity
but
for
the
personal
charms
of
the
lady
which
were
of
that
high
eminence
that
no
man
could
look
on
her
without
admiration
this
emulation
of
the
lords
kept
the
court
of
king
robert
full
of
bustle
homage
and
splendour
all
were
anxious
to
frustrate
the
designs
of
their
opponents
and
to
forward
their
own
so
that
high
jealousies
were
often
apparent
in
the
sharp
retorts
stern
looks
and
nodding
plumes
of
the
rival
wooers
and
as
the
princess
had
never
disclosed
her
partiality
for
one
above
another
it
was
judged
that
robert
scarcely
dared
openly
to
give
the
preference
to
any
of
them
a
circumstance
however
soon
occurred
which
brought
the
matter
fairly
to
the
test
it
happened
on
a
lovely
summer
day
at
the
end
of
july
that
three
and
twenty
noble
rivals
for
the
hand
of
the
beauteous
princess
were
all
assembled
at
the
palace
of
linlithgow
but
the
usual
gaiety
mirth
and
repartee
did
not
prevail
for
the
king
had
received
bad
tidings
that
day
and
he
sat
gloomy
and
sad
musgrave
had
issued
from
the
castle
of
roxburgh
had
surprised
the
castle
of
jedburgh
and
taken
prisoner
william
brother
to
the
lord
of
galloway
slain
many
loyal
scottish
subjects
and
wasted
teviotdale
with
fire
and
sword
the
conversation
turned
wholly
on
the
state
of
affairs
on
the
border
and
the
misery
to
which
that
country
was
exposed
by
the
castle
of
roxburgh
remaining
in
the
hands
of
the
english
and
at
length
the
king
enquired
impatiently
how
it
came
that
sir
philip
musgrave
had
surprised
the
castle
this
last
time
when
his
subjects
were
so
well
aware
of
their
danger
the
earl
of
hume
made
answer
that
it
was
wholly
an
affair
of
chivalry
and
one
of
the
bravest
and
noblest
acts
that
ever
was
performed
musgrave
mistress
the
lady
jane
howard
of
the
blood
royal
and
the
greatest
heiress
of
the
north
of
england
had
refused
to
see
him
unless
he
gained
back
his
honour
by
the
retaking
of
that
perilous
castle
and
keeping
it
against
all
force
intercession
or
guile
till
the
end
of
the
christmas
holidays
that
he
had
accomplished
the
former
in
the
most
gallant
stile
and
from
the
measures
that
he
had
adopted
and
the
additional
fortifications
that
he
had
raised
there
was
every
possibility
that
he
would
achieve
the
latter
what
said
the
king
must
the
spirit
of
chivalry
then
be
confined
to
the
country
of
our
enemies
have
our
noble
dames
of
scotland
less
heroism
in
their
constitutions
than
those
of
the
south
have
they
fewer
of
the
charms
of
beauty
or
have
their
lovers
less
spirit
to
fulfil
their
commands
by
this
sceptre
in
my
right
hand
i
will
give
my
daughter
the
princess
margaret
to
the
knight
who
shall
take
that
castle
of
roxburgh
out
of
the
hands
of
the
english
before
the
expiry
of
the
christmas
holidays
every
lord
and
knight
was
instantly
on
his
feet
to
accept
the
proposal
and
every
one
had
his
hand
stretched
towards
the
royal
chair
for
audience
when
margaret
arose
herself
from
the
king
left
hand
where
she
was
seated
and
flinging
her
left
arm
backward
on
which
swung
a
scarf
of
gold
and
stretching
her
right
that
gleamed
with
bracelets
of
rubies
and
diamonds
along
the
festive
board
hold
my
noble
lords
said
she
i
am
too
deeply
interested
here
not
to
have
a
word
to
say
the
grandchild
of
the
great
bruce
must
not
be
given
away
to
every
adventurer
without
her
own
approval
who
among
you
will
venture
his
honour
and
his
life
for
me
every
knight
waved
his
right
hand
aloft
and
dashed
it
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
eyeing
the
graceful
attitude
and
dignified
form
of
the
princess
with
raptures
of
delight
it
is
well
continued
she
the
spirit
of
chivalry
deserted
the
scottish
nation
hear
me
then
my
father
vow
shall
stand
i
will
give
my
hand
in
marriage
to
the
knight
who
shall
take
that
castle
for
the
king
my
father
before
the
expiry
of
the
christmas
holidays
and
rid
our
border
of
that
nest
of
reavers
but
with
this
proviso
only
that
in
case
of
his
attempting
and
failing
in
the
undertaking
he
shall
forfeit
all
his
lands
castles
towns
and
towers
to
me
which
shall
form
a
part
of
my
to
his
rival
is
it
fit
that
the
daughter
of
a
king
should
be
given
up
or
won
as
circumstances
may
suit
or
that
the
risk
should
all
be
on
one
side
who
would
be
so
unreasonable
as
expect
it
this
then
with
the
concurrence
of
my
lord
and
father
is
my
determination
and
by
it
will
i
stand
the
conditions
were
grievously
hard
and
had
a
damping
and
dismal
effect
on
the
courtly
circle
the
light
of
every
eye
deadened
into
a
dim
and
sullen
scowl
it
was
a
deed
that
promised
glory
and
renown
to
adventure
their
blood
for
such
a
dame
to
win
such
a
lady
as
the
princess
of
scotland
but
to
give
up
their
broad
lands
and
castles
to
enrich
a
hated
rival
was
an
obnoxious
consideration
and
what
in
all
likelihood
was
to
be
the
issue
when
all
the
forces
of
the
land
had
been
unable
to
take
the
castle
by
storm
where
was
the
probability
that
any
of
them
was
now
to
succeed
none
accepted
the
conditions
some
remained
silent
some
shook
their
heads
and
muttered
incoherent
mumblings
others
strode
about
the
room
as
if
in
private
consultation
my
honoured
liege
said
lady
margaret
none
of
the
lords
or
knights
of
your
court
have
the
spirit
to
accept
of
my
conditions
be
pleased
then
to
grant
me
a
sufficient
force
i
shall
choose
the
officers
for
them
myself
and
i
engage
to
take
the
castle
of
roxburgh
before
christmas
i
will
disappoint
the
bloody
musgrave
of
his
bride
and
the
world
shall
see
whether
the
charms
of
lady
jane
howard
or
those
of
margaret
stuart
shall
rouse
their
admirers
to
deeds
of
the
most
desperate
valour
before
the
christmas
bells
have
tolled
that
shall
be
tried
on
the
rocks
in
the
rivers
in
the
air
and
the
bowels
of
the
earth
in
the
event
of
my
enterprise
proving
succesful
all
the
guerdon
that
i
ask
is
the
full
and
free
liberty
of
giving
my
hand
to
whom
i
will
it
shall
be
to
no
one
that
is
here
and
so
saying
she
struck
it
upon
the
table
and
again
took
her
seat
at
the
king
left
hand
every
foot
rung
on
the
floor
with
a
furious
tramp
in
unison
with
that
stroke
of
the
princess
hand
the
taunt
was
not
to
be
brooked
nor
was
it
the
haughty
blood
of
the
douglasses
could
bear
it
no
longer
james
the
gallant
earl
of
douglas
and
mar
stepped
forward
from
the
circle
my
honoured
liege
and
master
said
he
i
have
not
declined
the
princess
offer
beshrew
my
heart
if
ever
it
embraced
such
a
purpose
but
the
stake
is
deep
and
a
moment
consideration
excusable
i
have
considered
and
likewise
decided
i
accept
the
lady
proposals
with
my
own
vassals
alone
and
at
my
own
sole
charge
will
i
rescue
the
castle
from
the
hands
of
our
enemies
or
perish
in
the
attempt
the
odds
are
high
against
me
but
it
is
now
a
douglas
or
a
musgrave
god
prosper
the
bravest
spoken
like
yourself
noble
douglas
said
the
king
the
higher
the
stake
the
greater
the
honour
the
task
be
yours
and
may
the
issue
add
another
laurel
to
the
heroic
name
james
of
douglas
said
lady
margaret
dost
thou
indeed
accept
of
these
hard
conditions
for
my
sake
then
the
hand
of
thy
royal
mistress
shall
buckle
on
the
armour
in
which
thou
goest
to
the
field
but
never
shall
unloose
it
unless
from
a
victor
or
a
corse
and
with
that
she
stretched
forth
her
hand
which
douglas
as
he
kneeled
with
one
knee
on
the
ground
took
and
pressed
to
his
lips
every
one
of
the
nobles
shook
douglas
by
the
hand
and
wished
him
success
does
any
man
believe
that
there
was
one
among
them
that
indeed
wished
it
no
there
was
not
a
chief
present
that
would
not
have
rejoiced
to
have
seen
him
led
to
the
gallows
his
power
was
too
high
already
and
they
dreaded
that
now
it
might
be
higher
than
ever
and
moreover
they
saw
themselves
outdone
by
him
in
heroism
and
felt
degraded
by
the
contract
thus
concluded
the
standard
of
the
douglas
was
reared
and
the
bloody
heart
flew
far
over
many
a
lowland
dale
the
subordinate
gentlemen
rose
with
their
vassals
and
followed
the
banner
of
their
chief
but
the
more
powerful
kept
aloof
or
sent
ambiguous
answers
they
deemed
the
service
undertaken
little
better
than
the
frenzy
of
a
madman
there
was
at
that
time
a
powerful
border
baron
nicknamed
sir
ringan
redhough
by
which
name
alone
he
was
distinguished
all
the
rest
of
his
life
he
was
warden
of
the
middle
marches
and
head
of
the
most
warlike
and
adventurous
sept
in
all
that
country
the
answer
which
this
hero
gave
to
his
own
cousin
thomas
middlemas
who
came
to
expostulate
with
him
from
douglas
is
still
preserved
verbatim
what
man
are
a
my
brave
lads
to
lie
in
bloody
claes
that
the
douglas
may
lie
i
sheets
wi
a
bonny
bedfellow
will
that
keep
the
braid
border
for
the
king
my
master
tell
him
to
keep
their
hands
fu
an
their
haunches
toom
an
they
soon
be
blythe
to
leave
the
lass
an
loup
at
the
ladle
an
the
fient
ae
cloot
shall
cross
the
border
to
gar
their
pots
play
brown
atween
and
tell
him
this
an
tell
him
that
redhough
said
it
if
he
dinna
work
by
wiles
he
never
pouch
the
profit
but
if
he
canna
do
it
an
owns
that
he
canna
do
it
let
him
send
word
to
me
an
i
tak
it
for
him
with
these
words
he
turned
his
back
and
abruptly
left
his
cousin
who
returned
to
douglas
ill
satisfied
with
the
success
of
his
message
but
nevertheless
delivered
it
faithfully
that
curst
carle
said
the
douglas
is
a
thorn
in
my
thigh
as
well
as
a
buckler
on
my
arm
as
cunning
as
a
fox
as
stubborn
as
an
oak
and
as
fierce
as
a
lion
i
must
temporize
for
the
present
as
i
can
not
do
without
his
support
but
the
time
may
come
that
he
may
be
humbled
and
made
to
know
his
betters
since
one
endeavour
has
failed
we
must
try
another
and
if
that
do
not
succeed
another
still
the
day
after
that
as
sir
ringan
was
walking
out
at
his
own
gate
an
old
man
with
a
cowl
and
a
long
grey
beard
accosted
him
may
the
great
spirit
of
the
elements
shield
thee
and
be
thy
protector
knight
said
he
an
wha
may
he
be
carle
an
it
be
your
will
said
ringan
an
wha
may
ye
be
that
gie
me
sic
a
sachless
benediction
as
to
my
shield
and
protection
look
ye
here
and
with
that
he
touched
his
sword
and
a
sheaf
of
arrows
that
was
swung
at
his
shoulder
an
what
are
all
your
saints
and
lang
nebbit
spirits
to
me
it
was
a
random
salutation
knight
said
the
old
man
seeing
his
mood
and
temper
i
am
not
a
priest
but
a
prophet
i
come
not
to
load
you
with
blessings
curses
nor
homilies
all
equally
unavailing
but
to
tell
you
what
shall
be
in
the
times
that
are
to
come
i
have
had
visions
of
futurity
that
have
torn
up
the
tendrils
of
my
spirit
by
the
roots
would
you
like
to
know
what
is
to
befal
you
and
your
house
in
the
times
that
are
to
come
i
never
believe
a
word
that
you
warlocks
say
replied
the
knight
but
i
like
aye
to
hear
what
you
say
about
matters
though
it
is
merely
to
laugh
at
ye
for
i
dinna
gie
credit
to
ane
o
your
predictions
sin
the
rhymer
days
the
spirit
o
true
warlockry
is
gane
he
foretauld
muckle
that
has
turned
out
true
an
something
that
i
hope
turn
out
true
but
ye
a
bairns
to
him
knight
said
the
stranger
i
can
tell
you
more
than
ever
the
rhymer
conceived
or
thought
upon
and
moreover
i
can
explain
the
words
of
true
thomas
which
neither
you
nor
those
to
whom
they
relate
in
the
smallest
degree
comprehend
knowest
thou
the
prophecy
of
the
hart
and
the
deer
as
it
is
called
the
hearte
heavit
in
het
blude
over

quhane
the
heide
s
is
gone
i
hae
heard
the
reide
often
and
often
said
the
knight
but
the
unborn
that
can
understand
that
though
the
prophecies
and
the
legends
of
the
rhymer
take
the
lead
i
my
lear
i
hae
always
been
obliged
to
make
that
a
passover
there
is
not
one
of
all
his
sayings
that
relates
as
much
to
you
and
your
house
knight
it
foretels
that
the
arms
of
your
family
shall
supersede
those
of
douglas
which
you
know
are
the
bloody
heart
and
that
in
endeavouring
to
exalt
himself
to
the
stars
the
d
that
is
the
douglas
shall
fall
but
that
your
house
and
name
shall
remain
when
the
stuarts
are
no
more
by
the
horned
beasts
of
old
england
my
father
portion
and
my
undiminished
hope
exclaimed
the
knight
thou
art
a
cunning
man
i
now
see
the
bearing
o
the
prophecy
as
plainly
as
i
see
the
hill
of
mountcomyn
before
my
and
as
i
know
thomas
never
is
wrong
i
believe
it
now
is
the
time
auld
warlock
now
is
the
time
ettling
at
a
king
daughter
but
his
neck
lies
in
wad
and
the
forfeit
will
be
his
undoing
the
time
is
not
yet
come
valiant
knight
nevertheless
the
prophecy
is
true
has
thy
horse
hoof
ever
trode
or
thine

knight
this
night
is
a
night
among
many
to
me
and
wo
would
be
to
me
if
any
thing
canopied
my
head
save
the
cope
of
heaven
there
are
horoscopes
to
be
read
this
night
for
a
thousand
years
to
come
one
cake
of
your
bread
and
one
cup
of
your
wine
is
all
that
the
old
wizard
requests
of
you
and
that
he
must
have
the
knight
turned
back
and
led
the
seer
into
the
and
fed
him
with
bread
and
wine
and
every
good
thing
but
well
he
noted
that
he
asked
no
holy
benediction
on
them
like
the
palmers
and
priors
that
wandered
about
the
country
and
therefore
he
had
some
lurking
dread
of
the
old
man
he
did
not
thank
the
knight
for
his
courtesy
but
wiping
his
snowy
beard
he
turned
abruptly
away
and
strode
out
at
the
gate
of
the
castle
sir
ringan
kept
an
eye
on
him
privately
till
he
saw
him
reach
the
top
of
blake
law
a
small
dark
hill
immediately
above
the
castle
there
he
stopped
and
looked
around
him
and
taking
two
green
sods
he
placed
the
one
above
the
other
and
laid
himself
down
on
his
back
resting
his
head
upon
the
two
sods
his
body
half
raised
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
heaven
the
knight
was
almost
frightened
to
look
at
him
but
sliding
into
the
cleuch
he
ran
secretly
down
to
the
tower
to
bring
his
lady
to
see
this
wonderful
old
warlock
when
they
came
back
he
was
gone
and
no
trace
of
him
to
be
seen
nor
saw
they
him
any
more

that
time

whilst
the
knight
and
his
lady
were
looking
about
in
amazement
for
their
mysterious
guest
the
sounded
the
great
bugle
a
tremendous
horn
that
lay
on
a
shelf
in
the
balcony
where
he
kept
watch
one
two
three
said
the
knight
counting
the
three
distinct
notes
a
signal
of
which
he
well
knew
the
language
what
can
that
mean
i
am
wanted
it
would
appear
another
messenger
from
the
douglas
i
warrant
sir
ringan
keep
by
that
is
your
own
said
the
lady
i
say
mind
your
own
concerns
and
let
the
douglas
mind
his
dame
said
the
chief
i
hae
gotten
some
mair
insight
into
that
affair
than
you
an
we
maun
talk
about
it
by
an
by
in
the
meantime
let
us
haste
home
and
see
who
is
arrived
as
they
descended
from
the
hill
hand
in
hand
for
none
walked
arm
in
arm
in
those
days
they
saw
richard
dodds
a
landward
laird
coming
to
meet
them
oh
said
sir
ringan
this
is
my
officious
cousin
dickie
o
dryhope
what
business
can
he
be
come
upon
it
will
be
something
that
he
deems
of
great
importance
i
hate
that
old
fawning
flattering
sycophant
said
the
lady
and
can
not
divine
what
is
the
cause
of
your
partiality
for
him
it
is
his
attachment
to
our
house
that
i
admire
and
his
perfect
devotion
to
my
service
and
interests
said
the
knight
mere
sound
exclaimed
the
lady
bitterly
mere
waste
of
superfluous
breath
i
tell
you
sir
ringan
that
for
all
your
bravery
candour
and
kindness
you
are
a
mere
novice
in
the
affairs
of
life
and
know
less
of
men
and
of
things
than
ever
knight
did
it
is
a
great
fault
in
women
said
the
knight
making
his
observation
general
that
they
will
aye
be
meddling
wi
things
they
ken
nought
about
they
think
they
ken
every
thing
an
wad
gar
ane
trow
that
they
can
see
an
inch
into
a
fir
gude
help
them
it
is
just
as
unfeasible
to
hear
a
lady
discussing
the
merits
of
warriors
an
yeomen
as
it
wad
be
to
see
me
sitting
nursing
a
foh
what
an
uncourtly
term
said
the
lady
what
would
king
robert
think
if
he
heard
you
speaking
in
that
uncouth
stile
i
speak
muckle
better
than
him
wi
his
short
clippit
highland
tongue
said
the
chief
but
hush
here
comes
the
redoubted
dickie
o
dryhope
no
sooner
were
the
knight
and
his
lady
eyes
turned
so
as
to
meet
dickie
than
he
whipped
off
his
bonnet
with
a
graceful
swing
and
made
a
low
bow
his
thin
gray
locks
waving
as
he
bowed
dickie
was
a
tall
lean
toothless
old
bachelor
whose
whole
soul
and
body
were
devoted
to
the
fair
sex
and
the
house
of
his
chief
these
two
mighty
concerns
divided
his
attention
and
often
mingled
with
one
another
his
enthusiasm
for
the
one
by
any
sudden
change
of
subjects
or
concatenation
of
ideas
being
frequently
transferred
to
the
other
dickie
approached
with
his
bonnet
in
his
hand
bowing
every
time
the
knight
and
lady
lifted
their
eyes
when
they
met
sir
ringan
shook
him
heartily
by
the
hand
and
welcomed
him
to
the
castle
of
mountcomyn
oh
you
are
so
good
and
so
kind
sir
ringan
bless
you
bless
you
bless
you
noble
sir
how
do
you
thrive
sir
ringan
bless
you
bless
you
and
my
excellent
and
noble
lady
mountcomyn
how
is
my
noble
dame
thank
you
said
the
lady
coldly
dickie
looked
as
if
he
would
have
shaken
hands
with
her
or
embraced
her
as
the
custom
then
was
but
she
made
no
proffer
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
and
he
was
obliged
to
keep
his
distance
but
this
had
no
effect
in
checking
his
adulations
i
am
so
glad
that
my
excellent
lady
is
well
and
the
young
squires
and
maidens
all
brisk
and
whole
i
hope
all
well
cousin
said
the
chief
eh
all
well
reiterated
dickie
oh
the
dear
delightful
darling
souls
o
bless
them
if
they
be
but
as
well
as
i
wish
them
and
as
good
as
i
wish
if
the
squires
be
but
half
so
brave
as
their
father
and
the
noble
young
sweet
dames
half
so
beautiful
as
their
lady
mother
oh
bless
them
bless
them
and
half
so
independent
and
honest
as
their
cousin
said
the
lady
with
a
rebuking
sneer
very
pleasant
very
pleasant
indeed
simpered
dickie
without
daring
to
take
his
lips
far
asunder
lest
his
toothless
gums
should
be
seen
such
babyish
flummery
rejoined
the
lady
with
great
emphasis
dickie
was
somewhat
abashed
his
eyes
that
were
kindled
with
a
glow
of
filial
rapture
appeared
as
with
flattened
pupils
nevertheless
the
benignant
smile
did
not
altogether
desert
his
features
the
knight
gave
a
short
look
off
at
one
side
to
his
lady
it
is
a
great
fault
in
ladies
cousin
said
he
that
they
will
always
be
breaking
their
jokes
on
those
that
they
like
best
and
always
pretending
to
keep
at
a
distance
from
them
my
lady
thinks
to
blind
my
een
as
many
a
dame
has
done
to
her
husband
afore
this
time
but
i
ken
an
some
mae
ken
too
that
if
there
ane
o
a
my
kin
that
i
durstna
trust
my
lady
wi
when
my
turned
that
ane
dickie
o
dryhope
h
h
h
neighed
dickie
laughing
with
his
lips
shut
my
so
pleasant
and
so
kind
but
oh
no
no
you
wrong
her
knight
h
h
h
but
all
joking
and
gibing
aside
my
lady
very
pleasant
i
came
express
to
inform
you
sir
ringan
that
the
douglasses
are
up
i
knew
it
and
the
maxwells
and
the
gordons
and
the
hendersons
well
and
sir
christopher
seton
is
up
and
the
elliots
and
the
laird
of
tibbers
is
up
well
well
i
came
expressly
to
inform
you
came
with
piper
news
said
the
lady
which
the
fiddler
has
told
before
you
that
good
said
dickie
my
lady
is
so
delightfully
pleasant
i
thought
sir
ringan
would
be
going
to
rise
with
the
rest
and
came
for
directions
as
to
raising
my
men
how
many
men
can
the
powerful
laird
of
dryhope
muster
in
support
of
the
warden
said
lady
mountcomyn
mine
are
all
at
his
command
my
worthy
lady
knows
that
said
dickie
bowing
every
one
at
his
command
i
think
said
she
that
at
the
battle
of
blakehope
you
furnished
only
two
who
were
so
famished
with
hunger
that
they
could
not
bear
arms
far
less
fight
very
pleasant
in
sooth
h
h
i
declare
i
am
delighted
with
my
lady
good
humour
you
may
however
keep
your
couple
of
at
home
for
the
present
and
give
them
something
to
eat
continued
she
the
warden
has
other
matters
to
mind
than
wasting
his
vassals
that
the
douglas
may
wive
very
true
and
excellent
good
sense
said
dickie
we
talk
of
that
anon
said
sir
ringan
and
with
that
they
went
into
the
castle
and
sat
down
to
dinner
there
were
twelve
gentlemen
and
nine
maidens
present
exclusive
of
the
knight
own
family
and
they
took
their
places
on
each
side
as
the
lady
named
them
when
sir
ringan
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
saw
the
station
that
dickie
occupied
he
was
dissatisfied
but
instantly
found
a
remedy
davie
pate
said
he
to
the
lad
that
waited
behind
him
mak
that
bowiefu
o
cauld

instantly
before
meat
be
put
to
mouth
the
order
was
no
sooner
given
than
obeyed
and
the
new
arrangement
placed
dickie
fairly
above
the
salt
the
dining
apparatus
at
the
castle
of
mountcomyn
was
homely
but
the
fare
was
abundant
a
dozen
yeomen
stood
behind
with
long
knives
and
slashed
down
the
beef
and
venison
into
small
pieces
which
they
placed
before
the
guests
in
wooden
plates
so
that
there
was
no
knife
used
at
the
dining
board
all
ate
heartily
but
none
with
more
industry
than
dickie
who
took
not
even
time
all
the
while
to
make
the
complaisant
observation
that
my
lady
was
so
pleasant
dinner
being
over
the
younger
branches
of
the
family
retired
and
all
the
kinsmen
not
of
the
first
rank
pretending
some
business
that
called
them
away
likewise
disappeared
so
that
none
were
left
with
the
knight
and
his
lady
save
six
the
lady
tried
the
effect
of
several
broad
hints
on
dickie
but
he
took
them
all
in
good
part
and
declared
that
he
never
saw
his
lady
so
pleasant
in
his
life
and
now
a
serious
consultation
ensued
on
the
propriety
of
lending
assistance
to
the
douglas
sir
ringan
first
put
the
question
to
his
friends
without
any
observation
the
lady
took
up
the
argument
and
reasoned
strongly
against
the
measure
dickie
was
in
raptures
with
his
lady
good
sense
and
declared
her
arguments
unanswerable
most
of
the
gentlemen
seemed
to
acquiesce
in
the
same
measure
on
the
ground
that
as
matters
stood
they
could
not
rise
at
the
douglas
call
on
that
occasion
without
being
considered
as
a
subordinate
family
which
neither
the
king
nor
the
douglas
had
any
right
to
suppose
them
and
so
strongly
and
warmly
ran
the
argument
on
that
side
that
it
was
likely
to
be
decided
on
without
the
chief
having
said
a
word
on
the
subject
simon
of
gemelscleuch
alone
ventured
to
dissent
i
have
only
to
remark
my
gallant
kinsmen
said
he
that
our
decision
in
this
matter
is
likely
to
prove
highly
eventful
without
our
aid
the
force
of
the
douglas
is
incompetent
to
the
task
and
the
castle
will
then
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
english
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
grievously
against
our
interest
if
he
be
defeated
and
forfeit
his
lands
the
power
of
the
border
will
then
remain
with
us
but
should
he
succeed
without
our
assistance
and
become
the
king
it
will
be
a
hard
game
with
us
to
keep
the
footing
that
we
have
i
conceive
therefore
that
in
withdrawing
our
support
we
risk
every
thing
in
lending
it
we
risk
nothing
but
blows
all
the
kinsmen
were
silent
dickie
looked
at
my
lady
mountcomyn
it
is
well
known
that
there
is
an
old
prophecy
existing
said
she
that
a
scot
shall
sit
in
the
douglas
chair
and
be
lord
of
all
his
domains
well
would
it
be
for
the
country
if
that
were
so
but
to
support
the
overgrown
power
of
that
house
is
not
the
way
to
accomplish
so
desirable
an
object
that
is
true
said
dickie
i
defy
any
man
to
go
beyond
what
my
lady
says
or
indeed
whatever
she
says
have
we
not
had
instances
of
their
jealousy
already
continued
she
we
have
had
instances
of
their
jealousy
already
said
dickie
interrupting
her
and
should
we
raise
him
to
be
the
king
he
would
kick
us
for
our
pains
rejoined
she
ay
he
would
kick
us
for
our
pains
said
dickie
think
of
that
either
please
to
drop
your
responses
sir
said
she
sternly
or
leave
the
hall
i
would
rather
hear
a
raven
croak
on
my
turret
in
the
day
of
battle
than
the
tongue
of
a
flatterer
or
sycophant
that
is
very
good
indeed
said
dickie
my
lady
is
so
pleasant
h

excellent
h
h
h
sir
ringan
saw
his
lady
drawing
herself
up
in
high
indignation
and
dreading
that
his
poor
kinsman
would
bring
on
himself
such
a
rebuke
as
would
banish
him
the
hall
for
ever
he
interposed
cousin
said
he
it
a
great
fault
in
women
that
they
canna
bide
interruption
an
the
mair
they
stand
in
need
they
take
it
the
waur
but
i
have
not
told
you
all
yet
a
very
singular
circumstance
has
happened
to
me
this
day
who
do
you
think
i
found
waylaying
me
at
my
gate
but
our
kinsman
the
powerful
old
warlock
master
michael
scott
master
michael
scott
exclaimed
the
whole
circle
every
one
holding
up
his
hands
has
he
ventured
to
be
seen
by
man
once
more
then
there
is
something
uncommon
to
befal
or
perhaps
the
world
is
coming
to
an
end
god
forbid
said
redhough
it
is
true
that
for
seven
years
he
has
been
pent
up
in
his
enchanted
tower
at
aikwood
without
speaking
to
any
one
save
his
spirits
but
though
i
do
not
know
him
this
must
have
been
he
for
he
has
told
me
such
things
as
will
astonish
you
and
moreover
when
he
left
me
he
laid
himself
down
on
the
top
of
the
little
law
on
his
back
and
the
devils
carried
him
away
bodily
through
the
air
or
down
through
the
earth
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
all
agreed
that
it
had
been
the
great
magician
master
michael
scott
sir
ringan
then
rehearsed
the
conversation
that
had
passed
between
the
wizard
and
himself
all
the
circle
heard
this
with
astonishment
some
with
suspense
and
others
with
conviction
but
dickie
with
raptures
of
delight
he
assured
me
said
redhough
that
my
son
should
ride
on
his
own
land
from
roxburgh
to
the
from
roxburgh
to
the
cried
dickie
think
of
that
all
the
links
of
the
bonny
teviot
and
slitterick
ha
ha
lads
think
of
that
and
he
clapped
his
hands
aloud
without
daring
to
turn
his
eyes
to
the
head
of
the
table
and
from
the
to
the
tower
o
sark
rejoined
the
knight
to
the
tower
of
sark
exclaimed
dickie
h
have
a
care
of
us
think
of
that
all
the
dales
of
liddel
and
ewes
and
the
fertile
fields
of
cannobie
who
will
be
king
of
the
border
then
my
lads
who
will
be
king
of
the
border
then
ha
ha

and
from
the
fords
of
sark
to
the
added
sir
ringan
dickie
sprang
to
his
feet
and
seizing
a
huge
timber
trencher
he
waved
it
round
his
head
the
chief
beckoned
for
silence
but
dickie
eyes
were
glistening
with
raprures
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
he
repressed
his
vociferations
and
over
the
nine
glens
of
niddisdale
beside
said
sir
ringan
dickie
could
be
restrained
no
longer
he
brayed
out
hurrah
hurrah
and
waved
his
trencher
round
his
head
all
the
esk
and
the
braid
forest
and
the
nine
glens
o
niddisdale
hurrah
hurrah
mountcomyn
for
ever
the

hu
hu
hu
the
knight
and
his
friends
were
obliged
to
smile
at
dickie
outrageous
joy
but
the
lady
rose
and
went
out
in
high
dudgeon
dickie
then
gave
full
vent
to
his
rapture
without
any
mitigation
of
voice
adding
my
lady
for
ever
to
the
former
two
and
so
shouting
he
danced
around
waving
his
immense
wooden
plate
the
frolic
did
not
take
and
sir
ringan
was
obliged
to
call
him
to
order
you
do
not
consider
cousin
said
the
warden
that
what
a
woman
accounts
excellent
sport
at
one
time
is
at
another
high
offence
see
now
you
have
driven
my
lady
away
from
our
consultation
on
whose
advice
i
have
a
strong
reliance
and
i
am
afraid
we
will
scarcely
prevail
on
her
to
come
back
oh
there
no
fear
of
my
lady
and
me
said
dickie
we
understand
one
another
my
lady
is
a
kind
generous
noble
soul
and
so
pleasant
for
as
pleasant
and
kind
as
she
is
i
am
deceived
if
she
is
easily
reconciled
to
you
ye
dinna
ken
kate
dunbar
boy
tell
your
lady
that
we
lack
her
counsel
and
expect
that
she
will
lend
us
it
for
a
short
space
the
boy
did
as
he
was
ordered
but
returned
with
an
answer
that
unless
dickie
was
dismissed
she
did
not
choose
to
be
of
the
party
i
am
sorry
for
it
said
sir
ringan
but
you
may
tell
her
that
she
may
then
remain
where
she
is
for
i
ca
spare
my
cousin
dickie
now
nor
any
day
these
five
months
and
with
that
he
began
and
discussed
the
merits
of
the
case
and
with
his
kinsmen
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
in
the
end
it
was
resolved
that
with
a
thousand
horsemen
they
would
scour
the
east
border
to
intercept
all
the
supplies
that
should
be
sent
out
of
england
and
thus
enrich
themselves
while
at
at
the
same
time
they
would
appear
to
countenance
the
mad
undertaking
of
douglas
chapter

i

down
with
the
enemy
to
morrow
john
the
castle
of
roxburgh
was
beleaguered
by
seven
thousand
men
in
armour
but
never
before
had
it
been
so
well
manned
or
rendered
so
formidable
in
its
butresses
and
to
endeavour
to
scale
it
appeared
as
vain
an
attempt
as
that
of
scaling
the
moon
there
was
a
great
deal
of
parading
and
noise
went
on
as
that
of
beating
drums
and
sounding
of
trumpets
and
bugles
every
day
and
scarcely
did
there
one
pass
on
which
there
were
not
tilting
bouts
between
the
parties
and
in
these
the
english
generally
had
the
advantage
never
was
there
perhaps
a
more
chivalrous
host
than
that
which
musgrave
had
under
his
command
within
the
walls
of
roxburgh
the
enthusiasm
the
gallantry
and
the
fire
of
the
captain
were
communicated
to
all
the
train
their
horses
were
much
superior
to
those
of
the
scots
and
in
place
of
the
latter
being
able
to
make
any
impression
on
the
besieged
they
could
not
with
all
the
vigilance
they
were
able
to
use
prevent
their
posts
from
being
surprised
by
the
english
on
which
the
most
desperate
encounters
sometimes
took
place
at
first
the
english
generally
prevailed
but
the
scots
at
length
became
inured
to
it
and
stood
the
shocks
of
the
cavalry
more
firmly
they
took
care
always
at
the
first
onset
to
cut
the
bridle
reins
with
their
and
by
that
means
they
disordered
the
ranks
of
their
enemies
and
often
drove
them
in
confusion
back
to
their
thus
months
flew
on
in
this
dashing
sort
of
warfare
and
no
impression
was
made
on
the
fortress
nor
did
any
appear
practicable
and
every
one
at
court
began
to
calculate
on
the
failure
and
utter
ruin
of
the
douglas
piercy
of
northumberland
proffered
to
raise
the
country
and
lead
an
army
to
the
relief
of
the
castle
but
this
interference
musgrave
would
in
nowise
admit
it
being
an
infringement
of
the
task
imposed
on
him
by
his
mistress
moreover
he
said
he
cared
not
if
all
the
men
of
scotland
lay
around
the
castle
for
he
would
defy
them
to
win
it
he
farther
bade
the
messenger
charge
piercy
and
howard
to
have
an
army
ready
at
the
expiry
of
the
christmas
holidays
wherewith
to
relieve
him
and
clear
the
border
but
to
take
no
care
nor
concern
about
him
till
then
about
this
time
an
incident
right
common
in
that
day
brought
a
number
of
noble
young
adventurers
to
the
camp
of
douglas
it
chanced
in
an
encounter
between
two
small
rival
parties
at
the
back
of
the
convent
of
maisondieu
which
stood
on
the
south
side
of
the
teviot
that
sir
thomas
de
somerville
of
carnwath
engaged
hand
to
hand
with
an
english
knight
named
sir
comes
de
moubray
who
after
a
desperate
encounter
unhorsed
and
wounded
him
the
affair
was
seen
from
the
walls
of
roxburgh
as
well
as
by
a
part
of
the
scottish
army
which
was
encamped
on
a
rising
ground
to
the
south
that
overlooked
the
plain
and
of
course
like
all
other
chivalrous
feats
became
the
subject
of
general
conversation
somerville
was
greatly
mortified
and
not
finding
any
other
way
to
recover
his
honour
he
sent
a
challenge
to
moubray
to
fight
him
again
before
the
gate
of
roxburgh
in
sight
of
both
armies
moubray
was
too
gallant
to
refuse
there
was
not
a
knight
in
the
castle
who
would
have
declined
such
a
chance
of
earning
fame
and
recommending
himself
to
his
mistress
and
the
fair
in
general
the
challenge
was
joyfully
accepted
and
the
two
knights
met
in
the
midst
of
a
circle
of
gentlemen
appointed
by
both
armies
on
the
castle
green
that
lay
betwixt
the
moat
and
the
river
immediately
under
the
walls
of
the
castle
never
was
there
a
more
gallant
combat
seen
they
rode
nine
times
against
each
other
with
full
force
twice
with
lances
and
seven
times
with
swords
yet
always
managed
with
such
dexterity
that
neither
were
unhorsed
nor
yet
materially
wounded
but
at
the
tenth
charge
by
a
most
strenuous
exertion
sir
thomas
disarmed
and
threw
his
opponent
out
of
his
saddle
with
his
dislocated
somerville
gained
great
renown
and
his
fame
was
sounded
in
court
and
in
camp
other
challenges
were
soon
sent
from
both
sides
and
as
readily
accepted
and
some
of
the
best
blood
both
of
scotland
and
england
was
shed
in
these
mad
chivalrous
exploits
the
ambition
of
the
young
scottish
nobles
was
roused
and
many
of
them
flocked
as
volunteers
to
the
standard
of
douglas
among
these
were
some
of
the
retainers
of
redhough
who
could
not
resist
such
an
opportunity
of
trying
their
swords
with
some
rivals
with
whom
they
had
erst
exchanged
sharp
blows
on
the
marches
simon
of
gemelscleuch
his
cousin
john
of
howpasley
and
the
laird
of
all
arrived
in
the
camp
of
douglas
in
one
night
in
order
to
distinguish
themselves
in
these
tilting
bouts
earl
douglas
himself
challenged
musgrave
hoping
thereby
to
gain
his
end
and
the
prize
for
which
he
fought
but
the
knight
true
to
his
engagement
sent
him
for
answer
that
he
would
first
see
the
beginning
of
a
new
year
and
then
he
should
fight
either
him
or
any
of
his
name
but
that
till
then
he
had
undertaken
a
charge
to
which
all
others
must
be
subordinate
the
laird
of
yardbire
the
strongest
man
of
the
border
fought
three
combats
with
english
squires
of
the
same
degree
two
on
horseback
and
one
on
foot
and
in
all
proved
victorious
for
one
whole
month
the
siege
presented
nothing
new
save
these
tiltings
which
began
at
certain
hours
every
day
and
always
became
more
obstinate
often
proving
fatal
and
the
eagerness
of
the
young
gentry
of
both
parties
to
engage
in
them
grew
into
a
kind
of
mania
but
an
event
happened
which
put
an
end
to
them
at
once
there
was
a
combat
one
day
between
two
knights
of
the
first
degree
who
were
surrounded
as
usual
by
twenty
lancers
from
each
army
all
the
rest
of
both
parties
being
kept
at
a
distance
the
english
on
the
tops
of
their
walls
and
the
scots
on
the
heights
behind
both
to
the
east
and
west
for
there
was
one
division
of
the
army
stationed
on
the
hill
of
barns
and
at
the
head
of
the
path
and
another
on
the
rising
ground
between
the
city
and
castle
the
two
gentlemen
were
equally
matched
and
the
issue
was
doubtful
when
the
attendant
scottish
guards
perceived
or
thought
they
perceived
in
the
bearing
of
the
english
knight
some
breach
of
the
rules
of
chivalry
on
which
with
one
voice
they
called
out
foul
play
the
english
answered
no
no
none
the
two
judges
called
to
order
on
which
the
spearmen
stood
still
and
listened
and
hearing
that
the
judges
too
were
of
different
opinions
they
took
up
the
matter
themselves
the
scots
insisting
that
the
knight
should
be
disarmed
and
turned
from
the
lists
in
disgrace
and
the
english
refusing
to
acquiesce
the
judges
dreading
some
fatal
conclusion
gave
their
joint
orders
that
both
parties
should
retire
in
peace
and
let
the
matter
be
judged
of
afterwards
on
which
the
english
prepared
to
quit
the
ground
with
a
kind
of
exultation
for
it
appeared
that
they
were
not
certain
with
regard
to
the
propriety
of
their
conduct
unluckily
it
so
happened
that
the
redoubted
charlie
scott
of
headed
the
scottish
pikemen
on
the
lists
that
day
a
very
devil
for
blood
and
battery
and
of
strength
much
beyond
that
generally
allotted
to
man
when
he
saw
that
the
insidious
knight
was
going
to
be
conducted
off
in
a
sort
of
triumph
and
in
a
manner
so
different
from
what
he
deemed
to
suit
his
demerits
he
clenched
the
handle
of
his
sword
with
his
right
hand
and
screwed
down
his
eyebrows
till
they
almost
touched
the
top
of
his
nose
what
now
muckle
charlie
said
one
that
stood
by
him
what
now
repeated
charlie
growling
like
a
and
confining
the
words
almost
within
his
own
breast
the
deil
sal
bake
me
into
a
to
gust
his
gab
wi
afore
i
see
that
saucy
tike
off
in
sic
a
way
and
with
that
he
dropt
his
pike
drew
his
sword
and
rushing
through
the
group
he
seized
the
knight
horse
by
the
bridle
with
his
left
hand
thinking
to
lead
both
him
and
his
master
away
prisoners
the
knight
struck
at
him
with
all
his
might
but
for
this
charlie
was
prepared
he
warded
the
blow
most
dexterously
and
in
wrath
by
the
help
of
a
huge
he
threw
the
horse
backward
first
on
his
hams
and
then
on
his
back
with
his
rider
under
him
tak
ye
that
master
for
whistling
o
sundays
said
the
intrepid
borderer
and
began
to
lay
about
him
at
the
english
who
now
attacked
him
on
both
sides
charlie
first
break
at
the
english
knight
was
the
for
a
general
attack
the
scots
flew
to
the
combat
in
perfect
silence
and
determined
hatred
and
they
were
received
by
the
other
party
in
the
same
manner
not
so
the
onlookers
of
both
hosts
they
rent
the
air
with
loud
and
reiterated
shouts
the
english
poured
forth
in
a
small
narrow
column
from
the
east
gate
along
the
but
the
scottish
horsemen
who
were
all
ready
mounted
the
better
to
see
the
encounter
from
their
stations
scoured
down
from
the
heights
like
lightning
so
that
they
prevailed
at
first
before
the
english
could
issue
forth
in
numbers
sufficient
to
oppose
them
the
brave
sir
richard
musgrave
the
younger
brother
led
the
english
he
having
rushed
out
at
their
head
on
the
first
breaking
out
of
the
affray
but
notwithstanding
all
his
bravery
he
with
his
party
were
driven
with
their
backs
to
the
moat
and
hard
pressed
douglas
with
a
strong
body
of
horse
having
got
betwixt
them
and
the
the
english
were
so
anxious
to
relieve
their
young
hero
that
they
rushed
to
the
gate
in
crowds
douglas
suffered
a
part
to
issue
and
then
attacking
them
furiously
with
the
cavalry
he
drove
them
back
in
such
confusion
that
he
got
possession
of
the
for
several
minutes
and
would
in
all
likelihood
have
entered
with
the
crowd
had
it
not
been
for
the
portcullis
the
machinery
of
which
the
scots
did
not
understand
nor
had
they
the
means
of
counteracting
it
so
that
just
when
they
were
in
the
hottest
and
most
sanguine
part
of
their
enterprize
down
it
came
with
a
clattering
noise
louder
than
thunder
separating
a
few
of
the
most
forward
from
their
brethren
who
were
soon
every
one
cut
down
as
they
refused
to
yield
in
the
meantime
it
fared
hard
with
richard
who
was
overpowered
by
numbers
and
though
the
english
archers
galled
the
scottish
cavalry
grievously
from
the
walls
he
and
all
that
were
with
him
being
forced
backward
they
plunged
into
the
moat
and
were
every
one
of
them
either
slain
or
taken
prisoners
the
younger
musgrave
was
among
the
latter
which
grieved
his
brother
sir
philip
exceedingly
as
it
gave
douglas
an
undue
advantage
over
him
and
he
knew
that
in
the
desperate
state
of
his
undertaking
he
would
go
any
lengths
to
him
from
that
day
forth
all
challenges
or
accepting
of
challenges
was
prohibited
by
musgrave
under
pain
of
death
and
a
proclamation
was
issued
stating
that
all
who
entered
the
castle
should
be
stripped
naked
searched
and
examined
on
what
pretence
soever
they
came
and
if
any
suspicious
circumstances
appeared
against
them
they
were
to
be
hanged
upon
a
post
erected
for
the
purpose
on
the
top
of
the
wall
in
sight
of
both
armies
he
was
determined
to
spare
no
vigilance
and
constantly
said
he
would
hold
douglas
at
defiance
there
was
only
one
thing
that
the
besieged
had
to
dread
and
it
was
haply
too
the
only
thing
in
which
the
scots
placed
any
degree
of
hope
and
that
was
the
total
failure
of
provisions
within
the
castle
musgrave
plan
of
getting
small
supplies
at
a
time
from
england
by
night
was
discovered
by
sir
ringan
redhough
and
completely
cut
off
and
as
douglas
hanged
every
messenger
that
fell
into
his
hands
no
new
plan
could
be
established
and
so
closely
were
the
english
beleaguered
that
any
attempt
at
sending
additional
supplies
to
those
they
had
proved
of
no
avail
the
rival
armies
always
grew
more
and
more
inveterate
against
each
other
and
the
most
sharp
and
deadly
measures
were
exercised
by
both
matters
went
on
in
this
manner
till
near
the
end
of
october
when
the
nights
grew
cold
long
and
dark
there
was
nothing
but
the
perils
of
that
castle
on
the
border
talked
of
over
all
scotland
and
england
every
one
man
maid
and
child
became
interested
in
it
it
may
well
be
conceived
that
the
two
sovereign
beauties
the
lady
jane
howard
and
princess
margaret
of
scotland
were
not
the
least
so
and
both
of
them
prepared
at
the
same
time
in
the
true
spirit
of
the
age
to
take
some
active
part
in
the
matter
before
it
came
to
a
final
issue
one
of
them
seemed
destined
to
lose
her
hero
but
both
had
put
on
the
resolution
of
performing
something
worthy
of
the
knights
that
were
enduring
so
much
for
their
sakes

evening
at
the
beginning
of
november
patrick
chisholm
of
castleweary
an
old
yeoman
in
the
upper
part
of
teviotdale
sat
conversing
with
his
family
all
in
a
merry
and
cheerful
mood
they
were
placed
in
a
circle
round
a
blazing
hearth
fire
on
which
hung
a
huge
caldron
boiling
and
bubbling
like
the
pool
at
the
foot
of
a
cataract
the
lid
was
suspended
by
a
rope
to
the
iron
crook
on
which
this
lordly
machine
was
hung
to
intercept
somewhat
the
showers
of
soot
that
now
and
then
descended
from
the
rafters
these
appeared
as
if
they
had
been
covered
with
pitch
or
black
japanning
and
so
violently
was
the
kettle
boiling
that
it
made
the
roof
of
pate
chisholm
bigging
all
to
shiver
notwithstanding
these
showers
of
soot
pate
and
his
four
goodly
sons
eyed
the
boiling
caldron
with
looks
of
great
satisfaction
for
ever
and
anon
the
hough
of
an
immense
leg
of
beef
was
to
be
seen
cutting
its
capers
in
the
boil
or
coming
with
a
graceful
semicircular
sweep
from
one
lip
of
the
pot
to
the
other
is
it
true

said

that
howard
is

home
to
their

that
night
with
their
share
of
a
rich
prey
that
the
warden
had
kidnapped
while
just
collecting
to
send
to
roxburgh
under
a
guard
of
five
thousand
men
but
sir
ringan
getting
intelligence
of
it

to
the
castle
o
mountcomyn
the
strangers
were
soon
all
on
their
feet
and
ushered
into
the
family
circle
for
there
was
no
in
the
house
but
that
one
they
consisted
of
five
stout
troopers
well
armed
a
page
and
a
young
nobleman
having
the
appearance
of
a
youth
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
of
age
every
eye
was
instantly
turned
on
him
there
was
something
so
extraordinary
in
his
appearance
instead
of
a
steel
helmet
he
wore
a
velvet
cap
shaped
like
a
crown
striped
with
belts
bars
and
crosses
of
gold
wire
and
manifestly
more
for
ornament
than
use
his
fair
ringlets
were
peeping
in
curls
out
from
below
his
cap
and
his
face
and
bright
blue
eyes
were
lovely
as
the
dawn
of
a
summer
morning
they
were
not
well
seated
till
a
noise
of
the
tread
of
horses

he
was
stopped
in
his
regretful
soliloquy
by
a
rough
voice
at
the
door
ho
wha
bauds
the
house
the
same
answer
was
given
as
to
the
former
party
and
in
a
minute
the

the

paid
little
attention
to
this
address
of
the
old
man
they
saw
that
he
was
superannuated
and
had
all
the
narrow
selfishness
that
too
generally
clings
to
that
last
miserable
stage
of
human
exisence
but
drawing
nigh
they
began
to
eye
the
southron

with
looks
of
dark
suspicion
if

of

night
dan
whipped
off
his
bonnet
and
clapped
his
foot
upon
it
and
bowing
low
and
awkwardly
to
his
prince
he
expressed
his
humble
respect
as
well
as
he
could
and
then
presented
the
prince
to
his
father
the
title
sounded
high
in
the
old
man
ears
he
pulled
off
his
bonnet
and
looked
with
an
unsteady
gaze
as
if
uncertain
on
whom
to
fix
it
a
prince
eh

that
he
pulled

and

to
be
heard
over
all
the
house

say

in

tremulous
voice
o

a
piece
o
an
english
cow
the
beef
didna
cost
you
dear
an
there
mair
where
it
cam
frae
the
old
man
would
not
give
up
his
point
but
persisted
in
saying
it
was
a
dangerous
experiment
and
an
unprofitable
waste
however
in
spite
of
his
remonstrances
the
board
was
loaded
with
six
wooden
bickers
filled
with
beef
broth
plenty
of
bannocks
and
a
full
quarter
of
english
ox
beef
to
which
the
travellers
did
all
manner
of
justice
the
prince
as
he
called
himself
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
the
young
english
nobleman
by
his
side
their
eyes
were
scarcely
ever
turned
from
one
another
faces
unless
in
a
casual
hasty
glance
to
see
how
others
were
regarding
the
same
face
the
prince
had
dark
raven
hair
that
parted
on
a
brow
of
snow
a
black
liquid
eye
and
round
lips
purer
than
the
cherry
about
to
fall
from
the
tree
with
ripeness
he
was
also
a
degree
taller
than
the
english
lord
but
both
of
them
as
well
as
their
two
pages
were
lovelier
than
it
became
men
to
be
the
troopers
who
attended
them
seemed
disposed
to
contradict
every
thing
that
came
from
the
adverse
party
and
if
possible
to
broach
a
quarrel
had
it
not
been
for
the
two
knights
who
were
all
suavity
good
breeding
and
kindness
to
each
other
and
seemed
to
have
formed
an
attachment
at
first
sight
at
length
prince
alexander
inquired
of
his
new
associate
his
name
and
business
at
the
scottish
court
provided
he
said
that
it
did
not
require
strict
secrecy
the
other
said
he
would
tell
him
every
thing
truly
on
condition
that
he
would
do
the
same
which
being
agreed
to
the
young
english
nobleman
proceeded
as
follows
my
name
is
lord
jasper
tudor
second
son
to
the
earl
of
pembroke
i
am
nearly
related
to
the
throne
of
england
and
in
high
favour
with
the
king
the
wars
on
the
borders
have
greatly
harassed
the
english
dalesmen
for
these
many
years
and
matters
being
still
getting
worse
between
the
nations
the
king
my
cousin
has
proposed
to
me
to
marry
the
princess
margaret
of
scotland
and
obtain
as
her
dowry
a
confirmation
of
these
border
lands
and
castles
so
that
a
permanent
peace
may
be
established
between
the
nations
and
this
bloody
and
desperate
work
cease
i
am
on
my
way
to
the
scottish
court
to
see
the
princess
your
sister
and
if
i
find
her
to
be
as
lovely
and
accomplished
as
fame
speaks
her
i
intend
to
comply
with
the
request
and
marry
her
forthwith
this
speech
affected
the
prince
so
much
that
all
the
guests
wondered
he
started
to
his
feet
and
smiling
in
astonishment
said
what
you
you
marry
m
m
my
sister
margaret
she
is
very
much
beholden
to
you
and
on
my
word
she
will
see
a
becoming
youth
but
are
you
sure
that
she
will
accept
of
you
for
a
husband
i
have
little
to
fear
on
that
head
said
the
lord
jasper
tudor
jeeringly
maids
are
in
general
not
much
averse
to
marriage
and
if
i
am
well
informed
your
lovely
sister
is
as
little
averse
to
it
as
any
of
her
contemporaries
the
prince
blushed
deep
at
this
character
of
his
sister
but
had
not
a
word
to
say
pray
continued
tudor
is
she
like
you
if
she
is
i
think
i
shall
love
her
i
would
not
have
her
just
like
you
neither
i
believe
said
the
prince
there
is
a
strong
family
likeness
but
tell
me
in
what
features
you
would
wish
her
to
differ
from
me
and
i
will
describe
her
minutely
to
you
in
the
first
place
said
the
amorous
and
tudor
i
should
like
her
to
be
a
little
stouter
and
more
manly
of
frame
than
you
and
at
least
to
have
some
appearance
of
a
beard
all
the
circle
stared
the
devil
you
would
my
lord
said
dan
wad
ye
like
your
wife
to
hae
a
beard
in
earnest
gude
faith
an
your
ain
war
like
mine
ye
wad
think
ye
had
eneuch
foreby
your
wife
the
prince
held
up
his
hands
in
astonishment
and
the
young
english
lord
blushed
deeper
than
it
behoved
a
knight
to
do
but
at
length
he
tried
to
laugh
it
by
pretending
that
he
had
unwittingly
said
one
thing
when
he
meant
the
very
contrary
for
he
wished
her
to
be
more
feminine
and
have
less
beard
i
think
that
will
hardly
be
possible
said
dan
but
perhaps
there
may
be
a
hair
here
an
there
on
my
lord
the
prince
chin
when
ane
comes
near
it
i
wadna
disparage
ony
man
far
less
my
son
well
my
noble
lord
said
the
prince
your
tale
has
not
a
little
surprised
me
as
well
it
may
our
meeting
here
in
like
circumstances
is
the
most
curious
rencounter
i
ever
knew
for
to
tell
you
the
plain
truth
i
am
likewise
on
an
errand
of
the
same
import
being
thus
far
on
my
way
to
see
and
court
the
lady
jane
howard
in
order
that
all
her
wide
domains
may
be
attached
to
my
father
kingdom
and
peace
and
amity
thereby
established
on
the
border
gracious
heaven
said
young
lord
tudor
can
this
that
i
hear
be
true
you
are
you
on
your
way
to
my
cousin
the
lady
jane
howard
why
do
you
not
know
that
she
is
already
affianced
to
lord
musgrave
yes
it
is
certain
i
do
but
that
is
one
of
my
principal
inducements
to
gain
her
from
him
that
is
quite
in
the
true
spirit
of
gallantry
but
save
her
great
riches
i
am
told
she
has
little
else
to
recommend
her
said
the
prince
and
pray
how
does
fame
report
of
my
cousin
jane
said
tudor
as
of
a
shrew
and
a
coquette
answered
the
prince
a
wicked
minx
that
is
intemperate
in
all
her
passions
it
is
a
manifest
falsehood
said
tudor
his
face
glowing
with
resentment
i
never
knew
a
young
lady
so
moderate
and
chastened
in
every
passion
of
the
female
heart
her
most
private
thoughts
are
pure
as
purity
itself
and
her
but
begging
your
pardon
my
lord
how
can
you
possibly
know
all
this
said
the
prince
i
do
know
it
said
the
other
it
is
no
matter
how
i
can
not
hear
my
fair
cousin
wronged
and
i
know
that
she
will
remain
true
to
musgrave
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
i
will
bet
an
earldom
on
that
head
said
the
prince
if
i
chuse
to
lay
siege
to
her
done
said
the
other
and
they
joined
hands
on
the
bargain
but
they
had
no
sooner
laid
their
hands
into
one
another
than
they
hastily
withdrew
them
with
a
sort
of
trepidation
that
none
of
the
lookers
on
save
the
two
pages
who
kept
close
by
their
masters
appeared
to
comprehend
they
too
were
both
mistaken
in
the
real
cause
but
of
that
it
does
not
behove
to
speak
at
present
i
will
let
you
see
said
the
prince
recovering
himself
that
this
celebrated
cousin
of
yours
shall
not
be
so
ill
to
win
as
the
castle
of
roxburgh
and
i
let
musgrave
see
for
how
much
truth
and
virgin
fidelity
he
has
put
his
life
in
his
hand
and
when
i
have
her
i
cage
her
for
i
do
like
her
i
would
give
that
same
earldom
to
have
her
in
my
power
the
young
lord
tudor
looked
about
as
if
he
meditated
an
escape
to
another
part
of
the
table
but
after
a
touch
that
his
page
gave
him
on
the
sleeve
he
sat
still
and
mustered
up
courage
for
a
reply
and
pray
sir
prince
what
would
you
do
with
her
if
you
had
her
in
your
power
something
very
different
from
what
i
would
do
with
you
my
lord
but
please
describe
her
to
me
for
my
very
heart
is
yearning
to
behold
her
describe
every
point
of
her
form
and
lineament
of
her
features
she
is
esteemed
as
very
beautiful
for
my
part
i
think
her
but
so
so
said
tudor
she
has
fair
hair
light
full
blue
eyes
and
ruddy
cheeks
and
her
brow
i
believe
is
as
fine
and
as
white
as
any
brow
can
be
o
frightful
what
a
description
what
an
ugly
minx
it
must
be
fair
hair
red
i
suppose
or
dirty
dull
yellow
light
blue
eyes
mostly
white
i
fancy
ah
what
a
frightful
immodest
ape
it
must
be
i
could
spit
upon
the
huzzy
mary
shield
us
exclaimed
young
tudor
moving
farther
away
from
the
prince
and
striking
lightly
with
his
hand
on
his
doublet
as
if
something
unclean
had
been
squirted
on
it
mary
shield
us
what
does
the
saucy
scot
mean
every
one
of
the
troopers
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
and
watched
the
eye
of
his
master
the
prince
beckoned
to
the
scots
to
be
quiet
but
lord
tudor
did
no
such
thing
for
he
was
flustered
and
wroth
pardon
me
my
lord
said
the
prince
i
may
perhaps
suffer
enough
from
the
beauty
and
perfections
of
your
fair
cousin
after
i
see
her
you
may
surely
allow
me
to
deride
them
now
i
am
trying
to
depreciate
the
charms
i
dread
but
i
do
not
like
the
description
of
her
tell
me
seriously
do
you
not
think
her
very
intolerable
i
tell
you
prince
i
think
quite
otherwise
i
believe
jane
to
be
fifty
times
more
lovely
than
any
dame
in
scotland
and
a
hundred
times
more
beautiful
than
your
tawny
virago
of
a
sister
whom
i
shall
rejoice
to
tame
like
a
spaniel
the
haughty
vain
conceited
swart
venom
that
she
should
lay
her
commands
on
the
douglas
to
conquer
or
die
for
her
a
fine
presumption
forsooth
but
the
world
shall
see
whether
the
charms
of
my
cousin
lady
jane
howard
or
those
of
your
grim
and
tawdry
princess
have
most
power
yes
they
shall
my
lord
said
the
prince
in
the
mean
time
let
us
drop
the
subject
i
see
i
have
given
you
offence
not
knowing
that
you
were
in
love
with
lady
jane
which
now
i
clearly
see
to
be
the
case
nevertheless
go
on
with
the
description
for
i
am
anxious
to
hear
all
about
her
and
i
promise
to
approve
if
there
be
a
bare
possibility
of
it
her
manner
is
engaging
and
her
deportment
graceful
and
easy
her
waist
is
slim
and
her
limbs
slender
and
elegant
beyond
any
thing
you
ever
saw
said
lord
tudor
o
shocking
exclaimed
the
prince
quite
forgetting
himself
worst
of
all
i
declare
i
have
no
patience
with
the
creature
after
such
a
description
who
can
doubt
the
truth
of
the
reports
about
the
extreme
levity
of
her
conduct
confess
now
my
lord
that
she
is
very
free
of
her
favours
and
that
the
reason
why
so
many
young
gentlemen
visit
her
is
now
pretty
obvious
high
offence
was
now
manifest
in
lord
jasper
tudor
look
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
said
in
great
indignation
i
did
not
ween
i
should
be
insulted
in
this
guise
by
the
meanest
peasant
in
scotland
far
less
by
one
of
its
courtiers
and
least
of
all
by
a
prince
of
the
blood
royal
yeomen
i
will
not
i
can
not
suffer
this
degradation
these
ruffian
scots
are
intruders
on
us
here
i
desire
that
you
will
expel
them
the
house
the
prince
of
scotland
was
at
the
head
of
the
table
tudor
was
at
his
right
hand
the
rest
of
the
english
were
all
on
that
side
the
scots
on
the
other
their
numbers
were
equal
dan
and
his
three
brethren
sat
at
the
bottom
of
the
board
around
the
old
man
who
had
been
plying
at
the
beef
with
no
ordinary
degree
of
perseverance
nor
did
he
cease
when
the
fray
began
every
one
of
the
two
adverse
parties
was
instantly
on
his
feet
with
his
sword
gleaming
in
his
hand
but
finding
that
the
benches
from
which
they
had
arisen
hampered
them
they
with
one
accord
sprung
on
the
tops
of
these
and
crossed
their
swords
the
pages
screamed
like
women
the
two
noble
adventurers
seemed
scarcely
to
know
the
use
of
their
weapons
but
looked
on
with
astonishment
at
length
the
prince
somewhat
collecting
himself
drew
out
his
shabby
whanger
and
brandished
it
in
a
most
unwarlike
guise
on
which
the
tudor
retreated
behind
his
attendants
holding
up
his
hands
but
still
apparently
intent
on
revenge
for
the
vile
obloquy
thrown
on
the
character
of
lady
jane

these
were
all
said
with

and
before
the
englishmen
had
time
to
reply
clash
went
the
swords
across
the
table
and
the
third
scot
the
true
aberdonian
was
wounded
as
were
also
two
of
the
englishmen
at
the
very
first
pass
these
matters
are
much
sooner
done
than
described
all
this
was
the
work
of
a
few
seconds
and
done
before

interfered
with
all

interrupted
in

by
a

hysteric
scream
from
young
tudor
who
pulled
out

whinyard
and
ran
at

at

awkward

lifted
up
his
heavy
sword
in
high
choler
to
cleave
the
stripling
and
he
would
have
cloven
him
to
the
belt
but
curbing
his
wrath
he
only
struck
his
sword
which
he
made
fly
into
pieces
and
jingle
against
the
rafters
of
the
house
then
seizing
the
young
adventurer
by
the
shoulder
he
snatched
him
up
to
him
on
the
board
where
he
still
stood
and
taking
his
head
below
his
arm
he
held
him
fast
with
the
one
hand
making
signs
with
the
other
to
his
brethren
to
join
the
scots
and
disarm
the
english
who
were
the
aggressors
both
times
in
the
meantime
he
was
saying
to
tudor
hout
hout
young
master
ye

the
five
english
squires
now
seeing
themselves
set
upon
by
nine
yielded
and
suffered
themselves
to
be
disarmed
when
tudor
came
to
himself
he
appeared
to
be
exceedingly
grieved
at
his
imprudence
and
ready
to
make
any
acknowledgment
while
the
prince
treated
him
with
still
more
and
more
attention
yet
these
attentions
were
ever
and
anon
mixed
with
a
teazing
curiosity
and
a
great
many
inquiries
that
the
young
nobleman
could
not
bear
and
did
not
chuse
to
answer
it
now
became
necessary
to
make
some
arrangement
for
the
parties
passing
the
night
patrick
chisholm
house
had
but
one
in
an
apartment
which
served
for
kitchen
and
hall
but
it
had
a
kind
of
as
it
was
then
and
is
always
to
this
day
denominated
in
that
part
of
the
country
there
was
scarcely
room
to
move
a
foot
in
it
for
besides
two
oaken
beds
with
bars
it
contained
five
huge
chests
belonging
to
the
father
and
his
sons
that
held
their
clothes
and
warlike
accoutrements
the
daughters
of
yeomen
in
these
days
did
not
sit
at
table
with
the
men
they
were
the
household
servants
two
of
pate
daughters
who
had
been
bustling
about
all
the
evening
conducted
the
two
noble
youths
into
this
apartment
together
with
their
two
pages
the
one
bed
was
neatly
made
down
with
clean
clothes
and
the
other
in
a
more
common
way
now
said
one
of
the
landward
lasses
you
twa
masters
are
to
sleep
thegither
in
here
in
o
this
gude
bed
ye
see
an
the
twa
lads
in
o
this
ane
the
two
young
noblemen
were
standing
close
together
as
behoved
in
such
a
room
on
the
girl
addressing
them
thus
their
eyes
met
each
other
but
were
as
instantly
withdrawn
and
fixed
on
the
floor
while
a
blush
of
the
deepest
tint
suffused
the
cheeks
of
both
spreading
over
the
chin
and
neck
of
each
the
pages
contemplated
each
other
in
the
same
way
but
not
with
the
same
degree
of
timidity
the
english
stripling
seemed
rather
to
approve
of
the
arrangement
or
at
least
pretended
to
do
so
for
he
frankly
took
the
other
by
the
hand
and
said
in
a
sweet
voice
but
broad
dialect
weall
yuong
scuot
daghest
thou
lig
woth
mey
the
young
caledonian
withdrew
his
hand
and
held
down
his
head
i
always
lie
at
my
master
feet
said
he
and
so
shall
you
do
colin
said
the
prince
for
i
will
share
this
bed
with
you
and
let
my
lord
take
the
good
one
i
can
not
go
to
bed
said
tudor
i
will
rest
me
on
this
chest
i
am
resolved
i
go
to
bed
nor
throw
off
my
clothes
ye

said
may
chisholm
who
visibly
wanted
a
romp
with
the
young
blooming
chief
ye
winna

me
has
been
at
sic
pains
making
it
up

here
an
help

we
sal
soon
see
whether
he
gang
til
his
bed
or
no
an
that
no
wi
his
braw
claes
on
neither
so
saying
the
two
frolicsome
queans
seized
the
rosy
stripling
and
in
a
moment
had
him
stretched
on
the
bed
and
making
his
doublet
fly
open
all
at
one
rude
pull
they
were
proceeding
to
undress
him
giggling
and
laughing
all
the
while
prince
alexander
from
a
momentary
congenial
feeling
of
delicacy
put
his
hand
hastily
across
to
keep
the
lapels
of
tudor
vesture
together
without
the
motion
having
been
perceived
by
any
one
in
the
hurry
and
that
moment
the
page
flung
himself
across
his
master
breast
and
reproved
the
lasses
so
sharply
that
they
desisted
and
left
them
to
settle
the
matter
as
they
chose
the
prince
had
however
made
a
discovery
that
astonished
him
exceedingly
for
a
few
minutes
his
head
was
almost
turned
but
the
truth
soon
began
to
dawn
on
his
mind
and
every
reflection
every
coincidence
every
word
that
had
been
said
and
offence
that
had
been
taken
tended
to
confirm
it
so
he
determined
not
for
farther
trial
but
for
the
joke
sake
to
press
matters
a
little
further
when
quietness
was
again
restored
and
when
the
blush
and
the
frown
had
several
times
taken
alternate
sway
of
the
young
lord
face
the
prince
said
to
him
after
all
my
lord
i
believe
we
must
take
share
of
the
same
bed
together
for
this
one
night
it
is
more
proper
and
becoming
than
to
sleep
with
our
pages
besides
i
see
the
bed
is
good
and
clean
and
i
have
many
things
to
talk
to
you
about
our
two
countries
and
about
our
two
intended
brides
or
let
us
call
them
in
the
meantime
oh
no
no
prince
said
tudor
indeed
i
can
not
i
may
not
i
would
not
sleep
in
the
same
bed
with
another
gentleman
no
i
never
did
never
do
not
say
so
my
dear
lord
for
on
my
word
i
am
going
to
insist
on
it
said
the
prince
coming
close
up
to
him
his
eyes
beaming
with
joy
at
the
discovery
he
had
made
you
shall
sleep
by
my
side
nay
i
will
even
take
you
in
my
bosom
and
caress
you
as
if
you
were
my
own
sweet
dear
lady
jane
howard
tudor
was
now
totally
confounded
and
knew
neither
what
to
say
for
himself
nor
what
he
did
say
when
he
spoke
he
held
out
both
his
hands
and
cried
do
not
prince
do
not
i
beg
i
implore
do
not
for
i
can
not
can
not
consent
i
never
slept
even
in
the
same
apartment
with
a
man
in
all
my
life
what
have
you
always
slept
in
a
room
by
yourself
asked
the
teazing
prince
no
never
but
always
with
ladies
yes
always
was
the
passionate
and
sincere
reply
here
the
prince
held
up
his
hands
and
turned
up
his
eyes
what
a
young
profligate
exclaimed
he
mary
shield
us
have
you
no
conscience
with
regard
to
the
fair
sex
that
you
have
begun
so
wicked
a
course
and
that
so
early
little
did
i
know
why
you
took
a
joke
on
your
cousin
so
heinously
amiss
i
see
it
now
truth
will
out
ah
you
are
such
a
youth
i
will
not
go
a
foot
further
to
see
lady
jane
what
a
wicked
degraded
imp
she
must
be
do
not
kindle
into
a
passion
again
my
dear
lord
i
can
well
excuse
your
feigned
wrath
it
is
highly
honourable
i
hate
the
knight
that
blabs
the
favours
he
enjoys
from
the
fair
he
is
bound
to
defend
the
honour
that
has
stooped
to
him
even
though
as
in
the
present
instance
i
suppose
it
have
stooped
to
half
a
dozen
more
besides
a
great
deal
of
taunting
and
ill
humour
prevailed
between
these
capricious
and
inexperienced
striplings
and
sorely
was
tudor
pressed
to
take
share
of
a
bed
with
the
prince
but
in
vain
his
feelings
recoiled
from
it
and
the
other
being
in
possession
of
a
secret
of
which
the
english
lord
was
not
aware
took
that
advantage
of
teazing
and
tormenting
him
almost
beyond
sufferance
after
all
it
was
decided
that
each
should
sleep
with
his
own
page
a
decision
that
did
not
seem
to
go
well
down
at
all
with
the
yorkshire
boy
who
once
ventured
to
expostulate
with
his
lord
but
was
silenced
with
a
look
of
angry
disdain
chapter
he
set
her
on
his
steed
himself
lap
on
behind
her
and
they
are
the
highland
hills
her
friends
they
can
not
find
her
as
they
rode
over
hill
and
dale
this
lady
often
fainted
and
cried
wo
to
my
cursed
moneye
that
this
road
to
me
invented
of
rob
o
cam
ye
here
to
fight
young
man
or
cam
ye
here
to
flee
or
cam
ye
out
o
the
wally
west
our
bonnie
bride
to
see
called
foul
it
is
by
this
time
needless
to
inform
my
readers
that
these
two
young
adventurers
were
no
other
than
the
rival
beauties
of
the
two
nations
for
whose
charms
all
this
bloody
coil
was
carried
on
at
roxburgh
and
who
without
seeing
had
hated
each
other
as
cordially
as
any
woman
is
capable
of
hating
her
rival
in
beauty
or
favour
so
much
had
the
siege
and
the
perils
of
roxburgh
become
the
subject
of
conversation
that
the
ears
of
the
two
maidens
had
long
listened
to
nothing
else
and
each
of
them
deemed
her
honour
embarked
in
the
success
of
her
lover
each
of
them
had
set
out
with
the
intent
of
visiting
the
camp
in
disguise
and
having
enough
of
interest
to
secure
protections
for
feigned
names
each
determined
to
see
her
rival
in
the
first
place
the
journey
not
being
far
and
neither
of
them
it
is
supposed
went
with
any
kind
intent
each
of
them
had
a
maid
dressed
in
boy
clothes
with
her
and
five
stout
troopers
all
of
whom
were
utterly
ignorant
of
the
secret
the
princess
had
by
chance
found
out
her
rival
sex
but
the
scottish
lady
and
her
attendant
being
both
taller
and
of
darker
complexions
than
the
other
two
no
suspicions
were
entertained
against
them
detrimental
to
their
enterprise
the
princess
never
closed
an
eye
but
lay
meditating
on
the
course
she
should
take
she
was
convinced
that
she
had
her
rival
in
her
power
and
she
determined
not
over
generously
to
take
advantage
of
her
good
fortune
the
time
drew
nigh
that
roxburgh
must
be
lost
or
won
and
well
she
knew
that
whichever
side
succeeded
according
to
the
romantic
ideas
of
that
age
the
charms
of
the
lady
would
have
all
the
honour
while
she
whose
hero
lost
would
be
degraded
considerations
which
no
woman
laying
claim
to
superior
and
charms
could
withstand
next
morning
dan
was
aroused
at
an
early
hour
by
his
supposed
prince
who
said
to
him
brave
yeoman
from
a
long
conversation
that
i
have
had
last
night
with
these
english
strangers
i
am
convinced
that
they
are
despatched
on
some
traitorous
mission
and
as
the
warden

in
northumberland
i
propose
conveying
them
straight
to
douglas
camp
there
to
be
tried
for
their

to
take
charge
of
them
and
deliver
them
safely
to
the
captain
before

high
reward
but
if

and

of
them
to

neck

the
lady
margaret
and
her
page
then
mounted
their
palfreys
and
rode
off
without
delay
but
instead
of
taking
the
road
by
gorranberry
as
they
had
proposed
over
night
they
scoured
away
at
a
light
gallop
down
the
side
of
the
teviot
at
the
town
of
hawick
she
caused
her
page
who
was
her
chief
and
confidant
likewise
in
boy
clothes
to
cut
out
her
beautiful
fleece
of
black
hair
that
glittered
like
the
wing
of
the
raven
being
determined
to
attend
in
disguise
the
issue
of
the
contest
she
then
procured
a
red
curled
wig
and
dressing
herself
in
a
highland
garb
with
a
plumed
bonnet
tartan
jacket
and
trowsers
and
highland
hose
and
brogues
her
appearance
was
so
completely
altered
that
even
no
one
who
had
seen
her
the
day
before
in
the
character
of
the
prince
her
brother
could
possibly
have
known
her
to
be
the
same
person
and
leaving
her
page
near
the
camp
to
await
her
private
orders
she
rode
straight
up
to
by
herself
being
examined
as
she
passed
the
outposts
she
said
she
brought
a
message
to
douglas
of
the
greatest
importance
and
that
it
was
from
the
court
and
her
address
being
of
such
a
superior
cast
every
one
furthered
her
progress
till
she
came
to
the
captain
tent
scarcely
did
she
know
him
care
anxiety
and
watching
had
so
worn
him
down
and
her
heart
was
melted
when
she
saw
his
appearance
never
perhaps
could
she
have
been
said
to
have
loved
him
till
that
moment
but
seeing
what
he
had
suffered
for
her
sake
the
great
stake
he
had
ventured
and
the
almost
hopeless
uncertainty
that
appeared
in
every
line
of
his
face
raised
in
her
heart
a
feeling
unknown
to
her
before
and
highly
did
that
heart
exult
at
the
signal
advantage
that
her
good
fortune
had
given
him
over
his
rival
yet
she
determined
on
trying
the
state
of
his
affections
and
hopes
before
leaving
hawick
she
had
written
a
a
letter
to
him
inclosing
a
lock
of
her
hair
neatly
plaited
but
this
letter
she
kept
back
in
order
to
sound
her
lover
first
without
its
influence
he
asked
her
name
and
her
business
she
had
much
business
she
said
but
not
a
word
save
for
his
private
ear
douglas
was
struck
with
the
courtly
manner
and
looked
at
him
with
a
dark
searching
eye
i
have
no
secrets
said
he
with
these
my
kinsmen
i
desire
before
them
to
know
your
name
and
business
my
name
said
the
princess
pertly
is
colin
roy
i
care
not
who
knows
my
name
but
no
word
further
of
my
message
do
i
disclose
save
to
yourself
i
must
humour
this
pert
stripling
said
he
turning
to
his
friends
if
his
errand
turns
out
to
be
one
of
a
trivial
nature
and
that
does
not
require
all
this
ceremony
i
shall
have
him
with
that
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
went
away
and
left
the
two
by
themselves
colin
as
we
must
now
for
brevity
sake
term
the
princess
was
at
first
somewhat
abashed
before
the
dark
eye
of
douglas
but
soon
displayed
all
the
effrontery
that
his
assumed
character
warranted
if
not
three
times
more
well
now
my
saucy
little
master
colin
roy
please
condescend
so
far
as
to
tell
me
whence
you
are
and
what
is
your
business
here
this
secret
business
of
such
vast
importance
i
am
from
court
my
lor
from
the
scottish
court
a
please
you
my
lor
but
not
directly
as
a
body
may
say
my
lor
not
directly
here
there
south
west
precipitately
incontrovertibly
ascertaining
the
scope
and
bearing
of
the
progressive
advance
of
the
discomfiture
and
gradual
wreck
of
your
most
flagrant
and
preposterous
undertaking
the
devil
confound
the
impertinent
puppy
hold
hold
my
lor
i
mean
your
presumptuous
and
foolhardy
enterprise
first
in
presuming
to
the
hand
of
my
mistress
the
king
daughter
my
lovely
and
queenly
mistress
and
then
in
foolhardily
running
your
head
against
the
walls
of
roxburgh
to
attain
this
and
your
wit
and
manhood
against
the
superior
generalship
of
a
musgrave
by
the
of
st
peter
i
will
cause
every
bone
in
your
body
to
be
basted
to
powder
you
incorrigible
pedant
and
puppy
said
the
douglas
and
seizing
him
by
the
collar
of
the
coat
he
was
about
to
drag
him
to
the
and
throw
him
into
the
air
hold
my
lor
please
keep
off
your
rough
uncourtly
hands
till
i
deliver
the
credentials
of
my
mistress
did
you
say
that
you
were
page
to
the
princess
margaret
yes
surely
you
are
i
have
erst
seen
that
face
and
heard
that
same
flippant
tongue
pray
what
word
or
token
does
my
dear
and
sovereign
lady
send
me
she
bade
me
say
that
she
does
not
approve
of
you
at
all
my
lor
that
for
her
sake
you
ought
to
have
taken
this
castle
many
days
ago
and
she
bade
me
ask
you
why
you
do
enter
the
castle
by
the
gate
or
over
the
wall
or
under
the
hill
which
is
only
a
sand
one
and
hang
up
all
the
englishmen
by
the
necks
and
send
the
head
of
philip
musgrave
to
his
saucy
dame
she
bade
me
ask
you
why
you
do
my
lor
women
will
always
be
women
said
douglas
surlily
to
himself
i
thought
the
princess
superior
to
her
sex
but
but
but
what
my
lor
has
she
not
good
occasion
for
displeasure
she
bade
me
tell
you
that
you
do
like
her
that
you
do
like
her
half
so
well
as
musgrave
does
his
mistress
else
why
do
you
do
as
much
for
her
he
took
the
castle
for
the
sake
of
his
mistress
and
for
her
sake
he
keeps
it
in
spite
of
you
therefore
she
bade
me
tell
you
that
you
must
and
beat
the
english
and
take
the
castle
from
them
for
she
will
not
suffer
it
that
lady
jane
howard
shall
triumph
over
her
tell
her
in
return
said
douglas
that
i
will
do
what
man
can
do
and
when
that
is
done
she
shall
find
that
i
neither
will
be
slack
in
requiring
the
fulfilment
of
her
engagement
nor
in
performing
my
own
if
that
womanish
tattling
be
all
that
you
have
to
say
begone
the
rank
of
your
employer
protects
you
hold
my
lor
she
bade
me
look
well
and
tell
her
what
you
were
like
and
if
i
thought
you
changed
since
i
waited
on
you
at
court
on
my
conscience
you
look
very
ill
these
are
hard
ungainly
features
of
yours
i
tell
her
you
look
very
shabby
and
very
surly
and
that
you
have
lost
all
heart
but
oh
my
lor
i
forgot
she
bade
me
tell
you
that
if
you
found
you
were
clearly
beat
it
would
be
as
well
to
draw
off
your
men
and
abandon
the
siege
and
that
she
would
perhaps
in
pity
give
you
a
moiety
of
your
lands
again
i
have
no
patience
with
the
impertinence
of
a
puppy
even
though
the
messenger
of
her
i
love
and
esteem
above
all
the
world
get
you
hence
oh
my
lor
i
have
not
third
done
yet
but
stay
here
is
a
letter
i
had
almost
forgot
douglas
opened
the
letter
well
he
knew
the
hand
there
were
but
few
in
scotland
who
could
write
and
none
could
write
like
the
princess
it
contained
a
gold
ring
set
with
rubies
and
a
lock
of
her
hair
he
kissed
them
both
and
tried
the
ring
first
on
the
one
little
finger
and
then
on
the
other
but
it
would
scarcely
go
over
the
nail
so
he
kissed
them
again
and
put
them
in
his
bosom
he
then
read
to
himself
as
follows
my
good
lord
i
enclose
you
two
of
my
troth
let
them
be
as
beacons
to
your
heart
to
guide
it
to
deeds
of
glory
and
renown
for
my
sake
put
down
these
english
margaret
shall
ever
pray
for
your
success
retain
my
page
colin
near
your
person
he
is
and
his
flippancy
affected
whatever
you
communicate
to
him
will
be
safely
transmitted
to
margaret
it
may
well
be
supposed
how
colin
watched
the
emotions
of
douglas
while
reading
this
heroic
epistle
and
in
the
true
spirit
of
the
age
they
were
abundantly
extravagant
he
kissed
the
letter
hugged
it
in
his
bosom
and
vowed
to
six
or
seven
saints
to
do
such
deeds
for
his
adored
and
divine
princess
as
never
were
heard
or
read
of
now
my
good
lor
said
the
page
you
must
inform
me
punctually
what
hopes
you
have
of
success
and
if
there
is
any
thing
wanting
that
the
kingdom
can
afford
you
my
ranks
are
too
thin
replied
the
douglas
and
i
have
engaged
to
take
it
with
my
own
vassals
the
warden
is
too
proud
to
join
his
forces
to
mine
on
that
footing
but
keeps
scouring
the
borders
on
pretence
of
preventing
supplies
and
thus
assisting
me
but
in
truth
for
enriching
himself
and
his
followers
if
i
could
have
induced
him
and
his
whole
force
to
have
joined
the
camp
famine
would
have
compelled
the
enemy
to
yield
a
month
agone
but
i
have
now
the
captain
brother
prisoner
and
i
have
already
given
him
to
know
that
if
he
does
not
deliver
up
the
castle
to
me
in
four
days
i
will
hang
the
young
knight
up
before
his
eyes
i
have
sworn
to
do
it
and
i
swear
again
to
keep
my
oath
i
will
convey
all
this
to
my
mistress
said
colin
so
then
you
have
his
only
brother
in
your
hold
my
lor
the
victory
is
your
own
and
the
princess
my
mistress
beside
in
a
few
hours
will
be
placed
in
your
hands
the
primal
cause
and
fomentor
of
this
cruel
and
bloody
war
the
lady
jane
howard
the
douglas
started
like
one
aroused
from
slumber
or
a
state
of
lethargy
by
a
sudden
wound
what
did
you
say
boy
said
he
either
i
heard
amiss
or
you
are
dreaming
i
have
offered
estates
nay
i
have
offered
an
earldom
to
any
hardy
adventurer
who
would
bring
me
that
imperious
dame
but
the
project
has
been
abandoned
as
quite
impracticable
rest
content
said
colin
i
have
secured
her
and
she
will
be
delivered
into
your
hands
before
night
she
has
safe
passports
with
her
to
the
scottish
court
but
they
are
in
favour
of
jasper
tudor
son
to
the
earl
of
pembroke
so
that
the
discovery
of
her
sex
proves
her
an
impostor
and
subjects
her
to
martial
law
which
i
request
for
my
mistress
sake
you
will
execute
on
her
my
lady
the
princess
with
all
her
beauty
and
high
accomplishments
is
a
very
woman
and
i
know
there
is
nothing
on
earth
she
so
much
dreads
as
the
triumph
of
lady
jane
over
her
besides
it
is
evident
she
was
bound
to
the
scottish
court
either
to
poison
the
princess
or
inveigle
her
into
the
hands
of
her
enemies
all
her
attendants
are
ignorant
of
her
sex
save
her
page
who
is
said
to
be
a
blooming
english
country
maiden
the
prince
alexander
bade
me
charge
you
never
to
mention
by
what
means
she
came
into
your
hands
but
to
give
it
out
that
she
was
brought
to
you
by
a
miracle
by
witchcraft
or
by
the
power
of
a
mighty
magician
it
is
well
thought
of
boy
said
the
douglas
greatly
elevated
i
have
been
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
such
means
already
this
will
confirm
all
the
princess
your
mistress
desired
that
you
should
remain
with
me
you
shall
be
my
right
hand
page
i
will
love
and
favour
you
you
shall
be
fed
with
the
bread
and
wine
and
shall
sleep
in
my
tent
and
i
will
trust
you
with
all
my
secrets
for
the
welcome
tidings
you
have
brought
and
for
the
sake
of
the
angelic
dame
that
recommends
you
to
me
for
she
is
my
beloved
my
adored
mistress
and
for
her
will
i
either
conquer
or
die
my
sword
is
her
my
life
is
her
nay
my
very
soul
is
the
right
of
my
beloved
poor
colin
dropped
a
tear
on
hearing
this
passionate
nonsense
women
love
extravagance
in
such
matters
but
in
those
days
it
had
no
bounds
it
was
not
long
till
the
prisoners
arrived
under
the
care
of
muckle
charlie
scott
of
yardbire
and
dan
chisholm
with
their
troopers
guarded
in
a
very
original
manner
when
charlie
arrived
at
old
chisholm
house
and
learned
that
a
had
been
there
and
had
given
such
charges
about
the
prisoners
he
determined
to
make
sure
work
and
as
he
had
always
most
trust
to
put
in
himself
he
took
the
charge
of
the
young
english
nobleman
and
his
squire
as
he
supposed
them
to
be
the
page
he
took
on
his
huge
black
horse
behind
him
lashing
him
to
his
body
with
strong
belts
cut
from
a
cow
raw
hide
his
ancles
were
moreover
fastened
to
the
straps
at
the
tops
of
charlie
great
war
boots
so
that
the
english
maiden
must
have
had
a
very
uncomfortable
ride
but
the
other
he
held
on
before
him
keeping
her
all
the
way
in
his
arms
exactly
as
a
countryman
holds
up
a
child
in
the
church
to
be
christened
the
lady
jane
howard
had
plenty
of
the
spirit
of
romance
about
her
but
she
neither
had
the
frame
nor
the
energy
of
mind
requisite
for
carrying
her
wild
dreams
of
female
heroism
into
effect
she
was
an
only
child
a
spoiled
one
having
been
bred
up
without
perhaps
ever
being
controlled
till
she
fell
into
the
hands
of
these
border
mosstroopers
her
displeasure
was
she
complained
bitterly
of
her
detainment
and
much
more
of
being
sent
a
prisoner
to
the
camp
when
she
found
herself
in
muckle
charlie
scott
arms
borne
away
to
be
given
up
to
the
man
whom
of
all
the
world
she
had
most
reason
to
dread
she
even
forgot
herself
so
far
as
to
burst
into
tears
charlie
with
all
his
inordinate
strength
and
prowess
had
a
heart
so
soft
that
as
he
said
himself
a
laverock
might
hae
laired
i
and
he
farther
added
that
when
he
saw
the
bit
bonny
english
callan
that
was
comed
o
sic
grand
blude
grow
sae
desperately
wae
an
fa
a
blirting
and
greeting
the
deil
a
bit
but
his
heart
was
like
to
come
out
at
his
mouth
this
was
no
lie
for
his
comrades
beheld
him
two
or
three
times
come
across
his
eyes
with
his
mailed
sleeve
a
right
uncouth
handkerchief
and
then
he
tried
to
comfort
the
youth
with
the
following
speech
troth
man
but
i
unco
wae
for
ye
ye
sae
young
an
sae
bonny

said
lady
jane
passionately
said
charlie

that
nonsense
he
can
as
easily
hang

or
do

for
it

do
little
good
to
me
to
see
your
bit
neck
rackit
it
was
most
unfair
as
well
as
most
ungenerous
in
your
prince
to
detain
me
said
she
as
my
business
required
urgency
i
had
regular
signed
warrandice
and
went
on
the
kindest
intent
besides
i
have
a
great
aversion
to
be
put
into
the
hands
of
douglas
how
many
cows
and
ewes
would
you
take
to
set

at

first
place
i
will
give

five
hundred
head
of
good
english
nolt
said
lady
jane
eh
what
said
charlie
holding
his
horse
still
and
turning
his
ear
close
round
to
the
lady
face
that
he
might
hear
with
perfect
distinctness
the
extraordinary
proffer
it
was
repeated
charlie
was
almost
electrified
with
astonishment
five
hunder
head
o
nout
exclaimed
he
but
d
mean
their

he
with
a

inquired
lady
jane
anxious
to
keep
muckle
charlie
in
the
humour
of
taking
her
any
where
save
into
the
hands
of
douglas
that
rather
a
question
to
speer
at

than
me
said
charlie
but
i
think
if

breaking
our

the
an
sinking
out
o

i
that

to
hae
ye

edinborough
afore
twal
at
bad
things
for
you
corby
never
say
another
word
about
it
then
said
lady
jane
the
rest
are
quite
gone
before
us
and
out
of
sight
turn
to
the
left
and
ride
for
edinborough
think
of
the
five
hundred
cows
and
five
thousand
sheep
oh
that
last
beats
a
said
charlie
five
thousand
sheep
how
mony

i
sure
o
that
every

five
score
then
and
how
mony

said
the
page
who
was
forced
to
laugh
at
charlie
arithmetic
ten
repeated
charlie
then
ten
times
five
hunder
that
maks
but
ae
thousand
an
other
ten
times
five
hunder
d
n
me
if
i

what
does
it
signify
for
a

i
fancy
we

jogg
on
the
gate
we
gaun
corby
i
am
sure
friend
ye
never
had
such
a
chance
of
being
rich
said
lady
jane
and
may
never
in
all
likelihood
have
such
a
chance
again
that
is
a
true
ye
saying
my
lord
an
a
sair
heart
it
has
me
said
charlie
but
your
offer
ower
muckle
an
that
maks
me
dread
there
something
at
the
bottom
that
i
dinna
comprehend
gude
faith
an
the
warden
war
to
suffer
danger
or
disgrace
for
my
greed
o
siller
it
wad
be
a
bonny
story
corby
straight
on
ye
dog
ding
the
brains
out
o
the
gutters
clear
for
the
camp
ye
hellicat
of
an
english
hound
what
are
ye
snoring
an
cocking
your
lugs
at
od
an
ye
get
company
like
yoursel
ye
carena
what
mischief
ye
carry
your
master
into
get
on
i
say
an
dinna
gie
me
time
to
hear
another
word
or
think
about
this
business
again
the
young
lady
began
here
to
lose
heart
seeing
that
charlie
had
plucked
up
a
determination
but
her
companion
attacked
him
in
her
turn
with
all
the
flattery
and
fair
promises
she
could
think
of
till
charlie
found
his
heart
again
beginning
to
waver
and
calculate
so
that
he
had
no
other
shift
but
to
croon
a
border
that
he
might
not
hear
this
dangerous
conversation
still
the
page
persevered
till
charlie
losing
all
patience
cried
out
as
loud
and
as
bitterly
as
he
could
haud
your
tongue
ye
limb
o
the
auld
ane
d
n
ye
d
think
a
conscience
is
to
be
hadden
abreed
like
the
mou
of
a
sack
an
crammed
fu
o
beef
an
mutton
whether
he
will
or
no
corby
another
nicker
another
snore
lad
an
we
soon
see
you
aff
at
the
gallop
thus
ended
the
trying
colloquy
between
muckle
charlie
scott
o
yardbire
and
his
two
prisoners
the
rest
of
his
conversation
was
to
corby
whom
he
forthwith
pushed
on
by
spur
and
flattery
to
the
camp
when
the
truth
came
to
be
discovered
many
puzzled
themselves
endeavouring
to
guess
what
charlie
would
actually
have
done
had
he
known
by
the
way
what
a
treasure
he
had
in
his
arms
the
greatest
beauty
and
the
greatest
heiress
in
england
for
charlie
was
as
notable
for
kindness
and
generosity
as
he
was
for
bodily
strength
and
besides
he
was
poor
as
he
frankly
acknowledged
but
then
he
only
wished
for
riches
to
be
able
to
keep
more
men
for
the
service
of
his
chief
some
thought
he
would
have
turned
his
horse
round
without
further
ceremony
and
carried
her
straight
to
yardbire
on
purpose
to
keep
her
there
for
a
wife
others
thought
he
would
have
risked
his
neck
honour
and
every
thing
and
restored
her
again
to
her
friends
but
it
was
impossible
for
any
of
them
to
guess
what
he
would
have
done
as
it
was
proved
afterwards
that
charlie
could
not
guess
himself
when
the
truth
came
to
be
divulged
and
was
first
told
to
him
his
mouth
besides
becoming
amazingly
extended
in
its
dimensions
actually
grew
with
astonishment
and
when
asked
what
he
would
have
done
had
he
known
he
smacked
his
lips
and
wiped
them
with
the
back
of
his
hand
as
if
his
teeth
had
been
watering
and
laughing
to
himself
with
a
chuckling
sound
like
a
he
turned
about
his
back
to
conceal
his
looks
and
only
answered
with
these
emphatic
words
gude
faith
it
was
as
weel
i
didna

intill
ane
widdy
in
the
same
grotesque
guise
as
formerly
described
charlie
at
length
came
with
his
two
prisoners
to
the
outposts
of
the
scottish
army
the
rest
of
the
train
had
passed
by
before
him
and
warned
their
friends
who
was
coming
and
in
what
stile
for
no
one
thought
it
worth
his
while
to
tarry
with
charlie
and
his
overloaden
horse
when
he
came
near
the
soldiers
they
hurra
and
waved
their
bonnets
and
gathering
about
charlie
in
crowds
they
would
not
let
him
onward
besides
some
fell
a
loosing
the
prisoner
behind
him
and
others
holding
up
their
arms
to
release
him
of
the
one
he
carried
before
and
seeing
how
impatient
he
was
and
how
determined
to
keep
his
hold
they
grew
still
more
importunate
in
frolic
but
it
had
nearly
cost
some
of
them
dear
for
charlie
growing
wroth
squeezed
the
lady
jane
so
strait
with
the
left
arm
that
she
was
forced
to
cry
out
and
putting
his
right
over
his
shoulder
he
drew
out
his
tremendous
sword
now

charlie

a
scott
never
gies
up
his

as
lang
as
his
arm
can
dimple
at

elbow
the
soldiers
flew
away
from
around
him
like
a
flight
of
geese
and
with
the
same
kind
of
noise
too
every
one
being
giggling
and
laughing
and
up
rode
charlie
to
the
door
of
the
douglas
pavilion
where
he
shouted
aloud
for
the
captain
douglas
impatient
to
see
his
illustrious
prisoner
left
the
others
abruptly
and
hasted
out
at
charlie
call
gude
faith
my
lord
said
charlie
i
beg
your
pardon
for
garring
you
come
running
out
that
gate
but
here
a
bit
english
lord
for
ye
his
henchman
sic
master
sic
man
as
the
saying
is
there
war
terrible
charges
about
them
sae
i
thought
i
wad
secure
them
an
gie
them
into
your
ain
hands
i
am
much
beholden
to
you
gallant
yardbire
said
douglas
the
care
and
pains
you
have
taken
shall
not
be
forgotten
this
encouraging
charlie
he
spoke
to
the
earl
with
great
freedom
who
was
mightily
diverted
with
his
manner
as
well
as
with
his
mode
of
securing
the
prisoners
there
his
lordship
for
ye
said
charlie
holding
him
out
like
a
small
bale
of
goods
mind
ye
hae
gotten
him
safe
off
my
hand
here
another
chap
i
hae
fastened
to
my
back
an
a
the
english
nobles
war
like
thir
twa
i
hae
been
thinking
my
lord
that
they
might
our
lasses
frae
us
but
we
wadna
be
ill
pinched
to
tak
their
kye
frae
them
an
it
wad
be
nae
hard
bargain
for
us
neither
so
saying
he
cut
his
belts
and
thongs
of
raw
hide
and
let
the
attendant
lady
in
clothes
free
of
his
body
he
a
little
fine
soft
cozey
callan
this
added
charlie
he
has
made
my
hinderlands
as
warm
as
they
had
been
in
an
oon
douglas
took
lady
jane
off
from
before
the
gallant
yeoman
in
his
arms
he
observed
with
what
a
look
she
regarded
him
and
he
was
sure
from
the
first
view
he
got
of
her
features
that
the
page
colin
must
have
been
right
with
regard
to
the
sex
of
the
prisoner
he
likewise
noted
the
holes
in
her
ears
from
which
it
was
apparent
that
pendent
jewels
had
lately
been
taken
and
he
hoped
the
other
part
of
the
information
might
likewise
be
correct
though
how
to
account
for
such
an
extraordinary
piece
of
good
fortune
he
was
wholly
at
a
loss
he
led
her
into
the
inner
pavilion
and
there
in
presence
of
his
secretary
and
two
of
his
kinsmen
examined
her
papers
and
passports
they
were
found
all
correct
and
signed
by
the
public
functionaries
of
both
nations
in
favour
of
jasper
tudor
son
to
the
earl
of
pembroke
these
are
quite
sufficient
my
young
lord
said
douglas
i
see
no
cause
for
detaining
you
further
you
shall
have
a
sufficient
guard
till
you
are
out
of
the
range
of
my
army
and
safe
furtherance
to
the
scottish
court
the
prisoner
countenance
lighted
up
and
she
thanked
douglas
in
the
most
grateful
terms
blessing
herself
that
she
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
so
courteous
a
knight
and
urged
the
necessity
of
their
sudden
departure
douglas
assured
her
they
should
be
detained
no
longer
than
the
necessity
of
the
times
required
but
that
it
was
absolutely
requisite
for
his
own
safety
the
safety
of
the
realm
and
the
success
of
the
enterprise
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
so
deeply
concerned
that
they
should
submit
to
a
personal
search
from
head
to
foot
lest
some
traitorous
correspondence
might
be
secretly
conveyed
by
them
the
countenance
of
the
prisoner
again
altered
at
this
information
it
became
at
first
pale
as
a
lily
and
immediately
after
blushed
as
deeply
as
the
damask
rose
while
the
tears
started
to
her
eyes
it
was
no
wonder
considering
the
predicament
in
which
she
now
stood
her
delicate
lady
form
to
be
searched
by
the
hands
of
rude
warriors
her
sex
discovered
and
her
mission
to
the
scottish
court
found
out
to
be
a
wild
intrigue
she
fell
instantly
on
her
knees
before
douglas
and
besought
him
in
moving
accents
to
dispense
with
the
useless
formality
of
searching
her
and
her
young
kinsman
and
companion
assuring
him
at
the
same
time
that
neither
of
them
had
a
single
scrap
of
writing
that
he
had
not
seen
and
adjuring
him
on
his
honour
and
generosity
as
a
knight
to
hearken
to
this
request
the
thing
is
impossible
my
lord
said
douglas
and
moreover
the
anxiety
you
manifest
about
such
a
trifle
argues
a
consciousness
of
guilt
you
must
submit
to
be
searched
on
the
instant
chuse
of
us
whom
you
will
to
the
office
i
will
never
submit
to
it
said
she
passionately
there
is
not
a
knight
in
england
would
have
refused
such
a
request
to
you
i
would
never
have
asked
it
my
lord
said
he
and
it
is
your
utter
inexperience
in
the
customs
of
war
that
makes
you
once
think
of
objecting
to
it
i
am
sorry
we
must
use
force
bring
in
two
of
the
guards
hold
hold
my
lord
said
lady
jane
since
i
must
submit
to
such
a
degradation
i
will
submit
to
yourself
i
will
be
searched
by
your
own
hands
and
yours
alone
they
were
already
in
the
inner
tent
douglas
desired
his
friends
to
go
out
which
they
complied
with
and
he
himself
began
to
search
the
person
of
lady
jane
with
the
most
careful
minuteness
as
he
pretended
well
aware
what
was
to
be
the
issue
of
the
search
he
examined
all
her
courtly
coat
pockets
lining
and
sleeves
he
came
to
her
gaudy
doublet
stiff
with
gold
embroidery
and
began
to
unloose
it
but
she
laid
both
her
hands
upon
her
breast
and
looked
in
his
face
with
eyes
so
speaking
and
so
beseeching
that
it
was
impossible
for
man
to
mistake
the
import
douglas
did
not
mistake
it
but
was
bent
upon
having
proof
positive
what
said
he
do
you
still
resist
what
is
here
you
would
conceal
oh
my
lord
said
she
do
you
not
see
i
see
nothing
said
he
and
while
she
feebly
struggled
he
loosed
the
vest
when
the
fair
heaving
bosom
discovered
the
sex
of
his
prisoner
and
at
the
same
time
with
the
struggle
the
beautiful
light
locks
had
escaped
from
their
confinement
and
hung
over
her
breast
in
waving
ringlets
the
maid
stood
revealed
and
with
the
disclosure
all
the
tender
emotions
and
restrained
feelings
of
the
female
heart
burst
forth
like
a
river
that
has
been
dammed
up
from
running
in
its
natural
channel
and
has
just
got
vent
anew
she
wept
and
sobbed
till
her
fair
breast
was
like
to
rend
she
even
seized
on
douglas
hand
and
wet
it
with
her
tears
he
on
his
part
feigned
great
amazement
how
is
this
said
he
a
maid
yes
indeed
my
lord
you
see
before
you
and
in
your
power
a
hapless
maid
of
noble
blood
who
set
out
on
a
crazy
expedition
of
love
but
from
inexperience
has
fallen
into
your
hands
then
the
whole
pretended
mission
to
our
scottish
court
is
it
appears
a
fraud
a
deep
laid
imposition
of
some
most
dangerous
intent
as
the
interest
that
has
been
used
to
accomplish
it
fully
demonstrates
you
have
subjected
yourself
and
all
your
followers
to
military
execution
and
the
only
method
by
which
you
can
procure
a
respite
either
for
yourself
or
them
is
to
make
a
full
confession
of
the
whole
plot
alas
my
lord
i
have
no
plot
to
confess
mine
was
merely
a
romantic
expedition
of
youthful
love
and
as
you
are
a
knight
and
a
lover
yourself
i
beg
your
clemency
that
you
will
pardon
my
followers
and
me
they
are
innocent
and
save
my
page
who
is
likewise
a
lady
and
my
own
kinswoman
all
the
rest
are
as
ignorant
who
i
am
and
what
i
am
as
the
child
that
is
unborn
if
you
would
entertain
any
hopes
of
a
reprieve
i
say
madam
either
for
yourself
or
them
declare
here
to
me
instantly
your
name
lineage
and
the
whole
of
your
business
in
scotland
and
by
whose
powerful
interest
you
got
this
safe
conduct
made
out
for
one
who
it
seems
knows
nothing
of
it
or
who
perhaps
does
not
exist
surely
you
will
not
be
so
ungallant
as
to
insist
upon
a
lady
exposing
herself
and
all
her
relations
no
my
lord
whatever
become
of
me
you
must
never
attain
to
the
knowledge
of
my
name
rank
or
titles
i
entrust
myself
to
your
mercy
you
can
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
machinations
of
a
damsel
i
am
placed
in
peculiarly
hard
circumstances
madam
i
have
enemies
abroad
and
at
home
and
have
nothing
but
my
own
energies
to
rely
on
to
save
my
house
and
name
from
utter
oblivion
and
my
dearest
hopes
from
extinguishment
this
expedition
of
yours
folded
as
it
is
in
deceit
and
forgery
has
an
ominous
and
daring
appearance
the
house
of
douglas
must
not
fall
for
the
tears
of
a
deceitful
maiden
the
daughter
of
my
enemy
without
a
full
disclosure
of
all
that
i
request
every
one
of
you
shall
suffer
death
in
the
sight
of
both
armies
before
the
going
down
of
the
sun
i
will
begin
with
the
meanest
of
your
followers
in
hopes
for
the
sake
of
your
youth
and
your
sex
that
you
will
relent
and
make
a
full
disclosure
of
your
name
and
all
your
motives
for
such
an
extraordinary
adventure
lady
jane
continued
positive
and
peremptory
as
did
also
her
attendant
who
had
been
thoroughly
schooled
in
case
of
their
sex
being
discovered
never
on
any
account
to
acknowledge
who
she
was
lest
it
should
put
musgrave
wholly
in
douglas
power
the
latter
therefore
to
keep
up
the
same
system
of
terror
and
retribution
first
practised
by
his
opponent
caused
sound
the
death
knell
and
hung
out
the
flag
of
blood
to
apprise
those
within
the
fortress
that
some
of
their
friends
were
shortly
to
be
led
to
execution
the
first
that
was
brought
out
was
a
swarthy
yeoman
who
said
his
name
was
edmund
heaton
and
that
he
had
been
a
servant
to
belsay
whom
he
had
followed
in
the
border
wars
when
told
that
he
was
about
to
be
hanged
for
a
spy
and
a
traitor
he
got
very
angry
even
into
such
a
rage
that
they
could
not
know
what
he
said
for
he
had
a
deep
rough
burr
in
his
throat
and
spoke
a
coarse
english
dialect

of

in
which
his

were

that
it

found
he
had
been
accompanying
two
ladies
in
disguise
on
some
traitorous
mission
which
they
would
not

and
it
was
the
law
of

that

should

crime
in
which

was
he
turned
off
and
hanged
in
sight
of
both
hosts
the
walls
of
roxburgh
were
crowded
with
spectators
they
could
not
divine
who
it
was
that
was
suffering
for
all
kind
of
communication
was
forbid
by
musgrave
and
it
was
now
become
exceedingly
difficult
great
was
their
wonder
and
anxiety
when
they
beheld
one
trooper
after
another
of
their
countrymen
brought
out
and
hanged
like
dogs
but
it
was
evident
to
every
beholder
from
the
unsettled
and
perturbed
motions
of
those
on
the
wall
that
something
within
the
fortress
was
distressing
the
besieged
some
hurried
to
and
fro
others
stood
or
moved
about
in
listless
languor
and
there
were
a
few
that
gazed
without
moving
or
taking
their
eyes
from
the
spot
where
they
were
fixed
not
one
flight
of
arrows
came
to
disturb
the
execution
as
usual
and
it
was
suspected
that
their
whole
stock
of
arrows
was
exhausted
this
would
have
been
good
tidings
for
the
scots
could
they
have
been
sure
of
it
as
they
might
then
have
brought
their
files
closer
to
the
walls
and
more
effectually
ensured
a
strict
blockade
lady
jane
followers
were
all
executed
and
herself
and
companion
sore
threatened
in
vain
douglas
however
meant
to
reserve
them
for
another
purpose
than
execution
to
ensure
to
himself
the
surrender
of
the
fortress
namely
but
of
her
squires
he
was
glad
to
be
rid
for
fear
of
a
discovery
being
made
to
the
english
that
the
lady
was
in
his
hands
which
might
have
brought
the
whole
puissance
of
the
realm
upon
him
whereas
the
generality
of
the
nation
viewed
the
siege
merely
as
an
affair
of
border
chivalry
in
which
they
were
little
interested
and
deemed
musgrave
free
from
any
danger
it
was
on
st
leonard
day
that
these
five
englishmen
were
executed
and
as
a
retaliation
in
part
a
scots
fisherman
was
hanged
by
the
english
from
the
wall
of
the
castle
one
who
indeed
had
been
the
mean
of
doing
them
a
great
deal
of
mischief
and
thus
stood
matters
at
that
period
of
the
siege
namely
the
earl
of
douglas
and
mar
lay
before
roxburgh
with
eight
thousand
hardy
veterans
all
his
own
vassals
the
redhough
kept
a
flying
army
on
the
borders
of
northumberland
chiefly
about
the
mountains
of
cheviot
and
interrupting
all
supplies
and
communications
from
that
quarter
and
doing
excellent
service
to
himself
and
followers
and
more
to
the
douglas
than
the
latter
seemed
to
admit
of
whenever
he
found
the
english
gathering
to
any
head
he
did
not
go
and
attack
them
but
leaving
a
flying
party
of
horse
to
watch
their
motions
he
instantly
made
a
diversion
somewhere
else
which
drew
them
off
with
all
expedition
a
numerous
army
hastily
raised
entered
scotland
on
the
west
border
on
purpose
to
draw
off
the
warden
but
they
were
surprised
and
defeated
by
the
laird
of
johnston
who
raised
the
annandale
people
and
attacked
the
english
by
night
he
followed
them
into
cumberland
and
fought
two
sharp
battles
with
them
there
in
both
of
which
he
had
the
advantage
and
he
then
fell
a
spoiling
the
country
this
brought
the
northumberland
and
durham
men
into
these
parts
who
mustered
under
sir
william
fetherstone
to
the
amount
of
fifteen
thousand
men
johnston
retired
and
the
earl
of
galloway
to
back
him
raised
twenty
thousand
in
the
west
and
came
towards
the
sarke
so
that
the
siege
of
roxburgh
was
viewed
but
as
an
item
in
the
general
convulsion
though
high
was
the
stake
for
those
that
played
and
ruthless
the
game
while
it
lasted
douglas
now
looked
upon
the
die
as
turned
in
his
favour
as
he
held
pledges
that
would
render
the
keeping
of
it
of
no
avail
to
his
opponent
the
lady
was
in
his
power
at
whose
fiat
musgrave
had
taken
and
defended
the
perilous
castle
so
bravely
but
of
this
no
man
knew
save
the
douglas
himself
sir
richard
musgrave
was
likewise
in
his
hand
the
captain
youngest
most
beloved
and
only
surviving
brother
and
douglas
had
threatened
against
a
certain
day
if
the
keys
of
the
castle
were
not
surrendered
to
him
to
hang
the
young
hero
publicly
in
the
view
of
both
hosts
and
in
all
his
threats
he
had
never
once
broke
his
word
we
must
now
take
a
peep
within
the
walls
of
roxburgh
and
see
how
matters
are
going
on
there

so

on

side

notwithstanding
of
this
the
power
of
the
scots
predominated
so
much
in
the
open
field
during
that
reign
that
this
chain
of
forts
proved
finally
of
no
avail
to
lord
musgrave
or
sir
philip
musgrave
as
he
is
generally
denominated
though
he
had
depended
on
keeping
the
communication
open
else
in
victualling
roxburgh
he
had
calculated
basely
the
garrison
were
already
reduced
to
the
greatest
extremes
they
were
feeding
on
their
horses
and
on
salted
hides
and
two
or
three
days
previous
to
this
their
only
communication
with
their
countrymen
had
been
cut
off
they
could
not
tell
how
it
was
at
best
only
precarious
being
carried
on
in
the
following
singular
the
besieged
had
two
communications
with
the
river
by
secret
covered
ways
from
the
interior
of
the
fortress
in
each
of
these
they
had
a
small
windlass
that
winded
on
and
let
off
a
line
nearly
a
mile
in
length
the
lines
were
very
small
being
made
of
plaited
brass
wire
and
putting
a
buoy
on
a
hook
at
the
end
of
each
one
of
these
they
let
them
down
the
water
their
friends
knowing
the
very
spot
where
they
stopped
watched
and
put
dispatches
on
the
hooks
with
fish
beef
venison
and
every
kind
of
convenience
which
they
pulled
up
below
the
water
sometimes
for
a
whole
night
together
and
though
this
proved
but
a
scanty
supply
for
a
whole
garrison
it
was
for
a
long
time
quite
regular
and
they
depended
a
good
deal
on
it
but
one
night
it
so
chanced
that
an
old
fisherman
who
fished
for
the
monastery
had
gone
out
with
his
coble
by
night
to
spear
salmon
in
the
river
he
had
a
huge
blaze
flaming
in
a
grate
that
stood
exalted
over
the
prow
of
his
wherry
and
with
the
light
of
that
he
pricked
the
salmon
out
of
their
deep
recesses
with
great
acuteness
as
he
was
plying
his
task
he
perceived
a
fish
of
a
very
uncommon
size
and
form
scouring
up
the
river
with
no
ordinary
swiftness
at
first
he
started
thinking
he
had
seen
the
devil
but
a
fisher
generally
strikes
at
every
thing
he
sees
in
the
water
he
struck
it
with
his
barbed
spear
called
on
tweed
a
and
in
a
moment
had
it
into
his
boat
it
was
an
excellent
sirloin
of
beef
the
man
was
in
utter
amazement
for
it
was
dead
and
lay
without
moving
like
other
butcher
meat
yet
he
was
sure
he
saw
it
running
up
the
water
at
full
speed
he
never
observed
the
tiny
line
of
plaited
wire
nor
the
hook
which
indeed
was
buried
in
the
lire
and
we
may
judge
with
what
surprise
he
looked
on
this
wonderful
fish
this
phenomenon
of
all
aquatic
productions
however
as
it
seemed
to
lie
peaceably
enough
and
looked
very
well
as
a
piece
of
beef
he
resolved
to
let
it
remain
and
betake
himself
again
to
his
business
never
was
there
an
old
man
so
bewildered
as
he
was
when
he
again
looked
into
the
river
never
either
on
tweed
or
any
other
river
on
earth
instead
of
being
floating
the
river
peaceably
in
his
boat
as
one
naturally
expects
to
do
he
discovered
that
he
was
running
straight
against
the
stream
he
expected
to
have
missed
about
fifty
yards
of
the
river
by
his
adventure
with
the
beef
but
no
instead
of
that
he
was
about
the
same
distance
advanced
in
his
return
up
the
stream
the
windlass
at
the
castle
and
the
invisible
wire
line
of
which
he
had
no
conception
having
been
still
dragging
him
gradually
up
saint
mary
the
mother
of
god
protect
and
defend
poor
sandy
yellowlees
cried
he
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
is
the
world
turned
upside
down
aha
our
auld
friend
michael
scott
has
some
hand
i
this
he
no
to
cree
legs
wi
i
be
quits
wi
him
with
that
he
tumbled
his
beef
again
into
the
water
which
held
on
its
course
with
great
rapidity
straight
up
the
stream
while
he
and
his
boat
returned
quietly
in
the
contrary
and
natural
direction
aye
there
it
goes
cried
sandy
straight
on
for
aikwood
i
warrant
that
for
the
warlock
an
the
deil
dinner
the
morn
god
be
praised
i
free
or
i
should
soon
have
been
there
too
old
sandy
fished
down
the
river
but
he
could
kill
no
more
salmon
that
night
for
his
nerves
had
got
a
shock
with
this
new
species
of
fishing
that
he
could
not
overcome
he
missed
one
wounded
another
on
the
tail
and
struck
a
third
on
the
where
no
leister
can
pierce
a
fish
till
he
made
him
spring
above
water
sandy
grew
chagrined
at
himself
and
the
warlock
michael
scott
too
for
this
last
was
what
he
called
a
real
prime
fish
sandy
gripped
the
leister
a
little
firmer
clenched
his
teeth
and
drew
his
bonnet
over
his
eyes
to
shield
them
from
the
violence
of
his
blaze
he
then
banned
the
wizard
into
himself
and
determined
to
kill
the
next
fish
that
made
his
appearance
but
just
as
he
was
keeping
watch
in
this
guise
he
perceived
another
fish
something
like
the
former
but
differing
in
some
degree
coming
swagging
up
the
river
full
speed
my
heart
laup
to
my
teeth
said
sandy
when
i
saw
it
coming
and
i
heaved
the
leister
but
durstna
strike
but
i
lookit
weel
an
saw
plainly
that
it
was
either
a
side
o
mutton
or
venison
i
couldna
tell
whilk
but
i
loot
it
gang
an
shook
my
head
michael

i

beguiled
ye
but
ye
weel
expeckit
to
gie
him
a
canter
to
hell
the
night
i
rowed
my
boat
to
the
side
an
made
a
the
haste
hame
i
could
for
i
thought
auld
michael
had
taen
the
water
to
himsel
that
night
sandy
took
home
his
few
fish
and
went
to
sleep
for
all
was
quiet
about
the
abbey
and
the
cloisters
of
his
friends
the
monks
and
when
he
awoke
next
morning
he
could
scarcely
believe
the
evidence
of
his
own
senses
regarding
what
he
had
seen
during
the
night
he
arose
and
examined
his
fishes
and
could
see
nothing
about
them
that
was
not
about
other
salmon
still
he
strongly
suspected
they
too
might
be
some
connections
of
michael
something
illusory
if
not
worse
and
took
care
to
eat
none
of
them
himself
delivering
them
all
to
the
cook
of
the
monastery
the
monks
ate
them
and
throve
very
well
and
as
sandy
had
come
by
no
bodily
harm
he
determined
to
try
the
fishing
once
again
and
if
he
met
with
any
more
such
fish
of
passage
to
examine
them
a
little
better
he
went
out
with
his
boat
light
and
as
usual
and
scarcely
had
he
taken
his
station
when
he
perceived
one
of
a
very
uncommon
nature
approaching
he
did
not
strike
at
it
but
only
put
his
before
it
as
if
to
stop
its
course
when
he
found
the
pressure
against
the
leister
very
strong
on
pulling
the
leister
towards
him
one
of
the
barbs
laid
hold
of
the
line
by
which
the
phenomenon
was
led
and
not
being
able
to
get
rid
of
it
he
was
obliged
to
pull
it
into
the
boat
it
was
a
small
cask
of
malmsey
wine
and
at
once
owing
to
the
way
it
was
drawn
out
he
discovered
the
hook
and
line
fastened
to
the
end
of
it
these
he
disengaged
with
some
difficulty
the
pull
being
so
strong
and
constant
and
the
mystery
was
thus
found
out
in
a
few
minutes
afterwards
he
seized
a
large
sheaf
of
arrows
and
some
time
after
at
considerable
intervals
a
number
of
excellent
sides
of
beef
and
venison
sandy
yellowlees
saw
that
he
could
now
fish
to
some
purpose
and
formed
a
resolution
of
being
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
tell
his
countrymen
of
this
resource
that
the
enemy
had
the
thing
of
which
he
was
most
afraid
was
a
discovery
he
knew
that
the
articles
would
soon
be
missed
and
that
his
light
would
betray
him
and
then
a
flight
of
arrows
or
even
a
single
one
from
a
lurking
foe
at
the
side
of
the
river
would
put
an
end
to
his
fishing
for
ever
such
an
opportunity
was
not
to
be
given
up
notwithstanding
of
this
danger
so
after
much
prying
both
by
day
and
by
night
sanders
found
that
at
an
abrupt
crook
in
the
water
whatever
the
line
brought
up
came
close
to
the
side
and
when
the
water
was
low
it
even
trailed
them
over
a
point
of
level
quite
dry
this
was
a
joyous
discovery
for
sandy
he
had
nothing
ado
but
to
sail
down
in
his
boat
when
it
grew
dark
and
lie
lurking
at
this
crook
in
the
water
and
make
a
prey
of
whatever
came
within
his
reach
the
very
first
night
he
filled
his
boat
half
full
of
valuable
stuff
there
was
a
necessity
for
disposing
of
a
part
of
this
and
sandy
was
obliged
to
aver
that
he
had
discovered
a
hidden
store
belonging
to
the
english
and
moreover
he
hinted
that
he
could
supply
the
towns
of
kelso
and
roxburgh
the
abbey
of
the
one
and
the
priory
of
the
other
for
some
time
to
come
great
was
the
search
that
was
made
about
the
banks
of
the
river
but
no
one
could
find
the
store
yet
sanders
yellowlees
continued
to
supply
the
market
with
luxuries
tho
no
one
knew
how
intelligence
was
sent
down
the
stream
with
the
buoys
of
the
seizure
of
the
provisions
and
of
the
place
where
they
were
taken
off
which
they
knew
from
the
failure
of
the
weight
they
were
pulling
to
be
always
at
the
same
place
the
news
also
spread
of
sandy
stores
and
both
reached
the
secret
friends
of
the
english
from
whom
the
provisions
were
nightly
sent
to
their
besieged
friends
and
benefactors
with
all
the
caution
and
secrecy
possible
it
being
given
them
to
understand
that
on
that
supply
alone
depended
the
holding
out
of
the
fortress
many
schemes
were
now
tried
to
entrap
sandy
but
all
without
effect
for
the
scots
had
a
strong
post
surrounding
that
very
point
where
sandy
caught
all
his
spoil
it
was
impossible
to
reach
it
but
by
a
boat
and
no
boat
was
allowed
on
the
river
but
that
one
that
belonged
to
the
abbey
at
length
an
english
trooper
undertook
to
seize
this
old
depredator
accordingly
in
the
dead
of
the
night
when
the
lines
came
down
he
seized
them
both
twisted
them
into
one
and
walked
silently
up
the
side
of
the
river
until
he
came
nigh
to
the
spot
where
the
scots
lines
on
each
side
joined
the
stream
he
then
put
the
two
hooks
into
his
buff
belt
and
committing
himself
to
the
water
was
dragged
in
silence
and
perfect
safety
up
the
pool
between
the
outposts
the
first
turn
above
that
was
the
point
where
sandy
lay
watching
he
had
only
seized
one
prey
that
night
and
that
was
of
no
great
value
for
they
had
given
over
sending
up
victuals
to
enrich
an
old
scots
rascal
as
they
termed
honest
sanders
he
was
glad
when
he
saw
the
wake
of
a
heavy
burden
coming
slowly
towards
him
this
is
a
sack
o
said
he
to
himself
it
must
be
currans
an
raisins
an
sic
fine
things
as
are
na
injured
by
the
fresh
water
i
shall
get
a
swinging
price
from
the
for
them
to
help
wi
their
christmas
pies
no
sooner
did
this
huge
load
touch
the
land
than
sandy
seized
it
with
all
expedition
but
to
his
inexpressible
horror
the
sack
of
sweetmeats
seized
him
in
its
turn
and
that
with
such
potence
that
he
was
instantaneously
overpowered
he
uttered
one
piercing
cry
and
no
more
before
the
trooper
gagged
and
pinioned
him
the
scottish
lines
were
alarmed
and
all
in
motion
and
the
troops
on
both
sides
were
crowding
to
the
bank
of
the
stream
a
party
was
approaching
the
spot
where
the
twain
were
engaged
in
the
unequal
struggle
to
return
down
the
stream
with
his
prisoner
as
he
intended
was
impracticable
so
the
trooper
had
no
alternative
left
but
that
of
throwing
himself
into
sandy
boat
with
its
owner
in
his
arms
shoving
her
from
the
side
into
the
deep
and
trusting
himself
to
the
strength
of
the
as
the
windlasses
were
made
always
to
exert
the
same
force
and
no
more
by
resisting
that
they
could
be
stopped
so
by
pushing
the
boat
from
the
side
in
the
direction
of
the
castle
the
line
being
slackened
that
again
set
them
agoing
with
great
velocity
and
though
they
soon
slackened
in
swiftness
the
trooper
escaped
with
his
prisoner
undiscovered
and
by
degrees
was
dragged
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
covered
way
that
led
through
or
under
the
hill
on
which
the
castle
stood
and
there
was
poor
sanders
yellowlees
delivered
into
the
hands
of
his
incensed
and
enemies
it
was
he
that
was
hanged
over
the
wall
of
the
castle
on
the
day
that
the
five
english
yeomen
were
executed
as
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
authenticity
of
this
part
of
the
curate
tale
these
secret
passages
must
have
been
carried
under
ground
all
the
way
from
the
castle
to
the
junction
of
the
two
rivers
and
it
is
said
that
a
tradition
still
exists
on
the
spot
that
these
vaulted
paths
have
often
been
discovered
by
former
inhabitants
the
english
now
conceived
that
their
secret
was
undiscovered
and
that
their
sufferings
would
forthwith
be
mitigated
by
the
supply
drawn
by
their
lines
they
commenced
briskly
and
successfully
but
alas
their
success
was
of
short
duration
sanders
secret
became
known
to
the
scots
army
the
had
often
seen
the
old
man
boat
leaning
on
the
shore
at
that
point
at
all
hours
of
the
night
for
he
was
always
free
to
go
about
plodding
for
fish
when
he
pleased
his
cry
was
heard
at
that
spot
and
the
boat
was
now
missing
the
place
was
watched
and
in
two
days
the
englishmen
secret
on
which
they
so
much
relied
was
discovered
and
quite
cut
off
and
that
powerful
garrison
was
now
left
with
absolute
famine
staring
them
in
the
face
as
in
all
cases
of
utter
privation
the
men
grew
ungovernable
their
passions
were
chafed
and
foamed
like
the
ocean
before
the
commencement
of
a
tempest
foreboding
nothing
but
anarchy
and
commotion
parties
were
formed
of
the
most
desperate
opposition
to
one
another
and
every
one
grew
suspicious
of
his
neighbour
amid
all
this
tempest
of
passion
a
mutiny
broke
out
a
strong
party
set
themselves
to
deliver
up
the
fortress
to
the
scots
but
through
such
a
medley
of
jarring
opinions
what
project
could
succeed
the
plot
was
soon
discovered
the
secured
and
sir
stephen
vernon
musgrave
most
tried
and
intimate
friend
found
to
be
at
the
head
of
it
no
pen
can
do
justice
to
the
astonishment
manifested
by
musgrave
when
the
treachery
of
his
dear
friend
was
fully
proven
his
whole
frame
and
mind
received
a
shock
as
by
electricity
and
he
gazed
around
him
in
moody
madness
as
not
knowing
whom
to
trust
and
as
if
he
deemed
those
around
him
were
going
to
be
his
assassins
wretch
that
i
am
cried
he
what
is
there
more
to
afflict
and
rend
this
heart
do
i
breathe
the
same
air
do
i
live
among
the
same
men
do
i
partake
of
the
same
nature
and
feelings
as
i
was
wont
my
own
friend
and
brother
vernon
has
he
indeed
lifted
up
his
hand
against
me
and
become
one
with
my
enemies
whom
now
shall
i
trust
must
my
dearest
hopes
my
honour
and
the
honour
of
my
country
be
sacrificed
to
disaffection
and
treachery
oh
vernon
my
brother
vernon
how
art
thou
fallen
i
confess
my
crime
said
vernon
and
i
submit
to
my
fate
since
a
crime
it
must
be
deemed
but
it
was
out
of
love
and
affection
to
you
that
your
honour
might
not
stoop
to
our
haughty
enemies
to
hold
out
the
fortress
is
impossible
and
to
persevere
in
the
attempt
utter
depravity
suppose
you
feed
on
one
another
before
the
termination
of
the
christmas
holidays
the
remnant
that
will
be
left
will
not
be
able
to
guard
the
sallying
ports
even
though
the
ramparts
are
left
unmanned
in
a
few
days
i
shall
see
my
brave
young
friend
and
companion
in
arms
your
brother
disgracefully
put
down
and
ere
long
the
triumphant
scots
enter
treading
over
the
feeble
remains
of
this
yet
gallant
army
i
may
bide
a
traitor
blame
and
be
branded
with
a
traitor
name
but
it
was
to
save
my
friends
that
i
strove
for
i
tell
you
and
some
of
you
will
live
to
see
it
to
hold
out
the
castle
is
impossible
it
is
false
cried
musgrave
it
is
false
it
is
false
cried
every
voice
present
in
the
with
frantic
rage
and
all
the
people
great
and
small
flew
on
the
culprit
to
tear
him
to
pieces
for
their
inveteracy
against
the
scots
still
grew
with
their
distress
it
is
false
it
is
false
shouted
they
down
with
the
traitor
sooner
shall
we
eat
the
flesh
from
our
own
bones
than
deliver
up
the
fortress
to
the
scots
down
with
the
false
knave
down
with
the
traitor
and
in
the
midst
of
a
tumult
that
was
quite
irresistible
vernon
was
borne
up
on
their
shoulders
and
hurried
to
execution
smiling
with
derision
at
their
madness
and
repeating
their
frantic
cries
in
mockery
it
was
in
vain
that
the
commander
strove
to
save
his
friend
as
well
might
he
have
attempted
to
have
stemmed
the
river
in
its
irresistible
course
vernon
and
his
associates
were
hanged
like
dogs
amid
shouts
of
execration
and
their
bodies
flung
into
a
pit
when
this
was
accomplished
the
soldiers
waved
their
caps
and
cried
out
so
fare
it
with
all
who
take
part
with
our
hateful
enemies
musgrave
shed
tears
at
the
fate
of
his
brave
companion
and
thenceforward
was
seized
with
gloomy
despondency
for
he
saw
that
subordination
hung
by
a
thread
so
brittle
that
the
least
concussion
would
snap
it
asunder
and
involve
all
in
inextricable
confusion
his
countenance
and
manner
underwent
a
visible
change
and
he
often
started
on
the
approach
of
any
one
toward
him
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
sword
the
day
appointed
by
the
douglas
for
the
execution
of
sir
richard
provided
the
castle
was
not
delivered
up
before
that
period
was
fast
approaching
an
event
that
musgrave
could
not
look
forward
to
without
distraction
and
it
was
too
evident
to
his
associates
that
his
brave
mind
was
so
torn
by
conflicting
passions
that
it
stood
in
great
danger
of
being
rooted
up
for
ever
it
is
probable
that
at
this
time
he
would
willingly
have
complied
with
the
dictates
of
nature
and
saved
the
life
of
his
brother
but
to
have
talked
of
yielding
up
the
fortress
to
the
scots
at
that
period
would
only
have
been
the
prelude
to
his
being
torn
in
pieces
it
was
no
more
their
captain
affair
of
love
and
chivalry
that
influenced
them
but
desperate
animosity
against
their
besiegers
and
every
one
called
aloud
for
succours
communication
with
their
friends
was
impracticable
but
they
hoped
that
their
condition
was
known
and
that
succours
would
soon
alas
their
friends
in
northumberland
had
enough
ado
to
defend
themselves
nor
could
they
do
it
so
effectually
but
that
their
lands
were
sometimes
harried
to
their
very
doors
the
warden
with
his
hardy
mountaineers
was
indefatigable
and
the
english
garrison
were
now
so
closely
beleaguered
that
all
chance
of
driving
a
prey
from
the
country
faded
from
their
hopes
never
was
the
portcullis
drawn
up
nor
the
at
either
end
let
down
that
intelligence
was
not
communicated
by
blast
of
bugle
to
the
whole
scottish
army
who
were
instantly
on
the
alert
the
latter
fared
sumptuously
while
those
within
the
walls
were
famishing
and
at
length
the
day
appointed
for
the
execution
of
sir
richard
drew
so
near
that
three
days
only
were
to
run
it
had
been
customary
for
the
english
whenever
the
scots
sent
out
a
herald
bearing
the
flag
of
truce
to
make
any
proposal
whatsoever
to
salute
him
with
a
flight
of
arrows
all
communication
or
listening
to
proposals
being
strictly
forbidden
by
the
captain
on
pain
of
death
however
that
day
when
the
douglas
herald
appeared
on
the
rising
ground
called
the
hill
of
barns
musgrave
caused
answer
him
by
a
corresponding
flag
hoping
it
might
be
some
proposal
of
a
ransom
for
the
life
of
his
beloved
brother
on
which
the
heralds
had
an
interchange
of
words
at
the
the
scottish
herald
made
demand
of
the
castle
in
his
captain
name
and
added
that
the
douglas
requested
it
might
be
done
instantly
to
save
the
life
of
a
brave
and
noble
youth
whom
he
would
gladly
spare
but
could
not
break
his
word
and
his
oath
that
he
should
suffer
he
farther
assured
the
english
captain
that
it
was
in
vain
for
him
to
sacrifice
his
brother
for
that
he
had
the
means
in
his
power
to
bring
him
under
subjection
the
day
following
if
he
chose
a
council
of
the
gentlemen
in
the
castle
was
called
every
one
spoke
in
anger
and
treated
the
demand
with
derision
musgrave
spoke
not
a
word
but
with
a
look
of
unstable
attention
on
every
one
that
spoke
collected
their
verdicts
and
in
a
few
minutes
this
answer
was
returned
to
the
requisition
of
the
scots
if
sir
philip
musgrave
himself
and
every
english
knight
and
gentleman
in
the
castle
were
now
in
the
hands
of
the
douglas
and
doomed
to
the
same
fate
of
their
brave
young
friend
still
the
douglas
should
not
gain
his
point
the
castle
would
not
be
delivered
up
the
garrison
scorn
his
proposals
they
despise
his
threats
and
they
hold
his
power
at
defiance
such
tender
mercies
as
he
bestows
such
shall
he
experience
he
shall
only
take
the
castle
by
treading
over
the
breasts
of
the
last
six
men
that
remain
alive
in
it
this
was
the
general
answer
for
the
garrison
in
the
meantime
musgrave
requested
as
a
personal
favour
of
the
douglas
that
he
might
see
and
condole
with
his
brother
one
hour
before
his
fatal
exit
the
request
was
readily
complied
with
and
every
assurance
of
safe
conduct
and
protection
added
the
douglas
pavilion
stood
on
the
rising
ground
between
the
castle
and
the
then
splendid
city
of
roxburgh
a
position
from
which
he
had
a
view
of
both
rivers
and
all
that
passed
around
the
castle
and
in
the
town
but
since
the
commencement
of
winter
he
had
lodged
over
night
in
a
tower
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
called
the
king
house
that
had
prisons
underneath
and
was
strongly
guarded
but
during
the
day
he
continued
at
the
pavilion
in
order
to
keep
an
eye
over
the
siege
to
this
pavilion
therefore
musgrave
was
suffered
to
pass
with
only
one
knight
attendant
and
all
the
way
from
the
to
the
tent
they
passed
between
two
files
of
armed
soldiers
whose
features
forms
and
armour
exhibited
a
strange
contrast
the
one
rank
was
made
up
of
mar
highlanders
men
short
of
stature
with
red
locks
high
cheek
bones
and
looks
that
indicated
a
ferocity
of
nature
the
other
was
composed
of
lowlanders
from
the
dales
of
the
south
and
the
west
men
clothed
in
grey
with
sedate
looks
strong
athletic
frames
and
faces
of
blunt
and
honest
bravery
musgrave
weened
himself
passing
between
the
ranks
of
two
different
nations
instead
of
the
vassals
of
one
scottish
nobleman
at
the
pavilion
the
state
splendour
and
number
of
attendant
knights
and
squires
amazed
him
but
by
them
all
he
was
received
with
the
most
courteous
respect
sir
richard
was
brought
up
from
the
vaults
of
the
king
house
to
the
tent
as
the
most
convenient
place
for
the
meeting
with
his
brother
and
for
the
guards
to
be
stationed
around
them
and
there
being
placed
in
one
of
the
apartments
of
the
pavilion
his
brother
was
ushered
in
to
him
no
one
was
present
at
the
meeting
but
from
an
inner
apartment
all
that
passed
between
them
was
overheard
musgrave
clasped
his
younger
brother
in
his
arms
the
other
could
not
return
the
embrace
for
his
chains
were
not
taken
off
but
their
meeting
was
passionately
affecting
as
the
last
meeting
between
two
brothers
must
always
be
when
the
elder
retired
a
step
that
they
might
gaze
on
each
other
what
a
difference
in
appearance
what
a
contrast
they
exhibited
to
each
other
the
man
in
chains
doomed
to
instant
death
had
looks
of
blooming
health
and
manly
fortitude
the
free
man
the
renowned
lord
musgrave
governor
of
the
impregnable
but
perilous
castle
of
roxburgh
and
the
affianced
lord
and
husband
to
the
richest
and
most
beautiful
lady
in
england
was
the
picture
of
haggard
despair
and
misfortune
he
appeared
but
the
remnant
the
skeleton
of
the
hero
he
had
lately
been
and
a
sullen
instability
of
mind
flashed
loweringly
in
his
dark
eye
his
brother
was
almost
terrified
at
his
looks
for
he
regarded
him
sometimes
as
with
dark
suspicion
and
as
if
he
dreaded
him
to
be
an
incendiary
my
dear
brother
said
sir
richard
what
is
it
that
hangs
upon
your
mind
and
discomposes
you
so
much
you
are
indeed
an
altered
man
since
i
had
the
misfortune
to
be
taken
from
you
tell
me
how
fares
all
within
the
castle
oh
very
well
quite
well
brother
all
perfectly
secure
quite
well
within
the
castle
but
as
he
said
this
he
strode
rapidly
backward
and
forward
across
the
small
apartment
and
eyed
the
canvass
on
each
side
with
a
grin
of
rage
as
if
he
suspected
that
it
concealed
listeners
nor
was
he
wrong
in
his
conjecture
though
it
was
only
caused
by
the
frenzy
of
habitual
distrust
but
how
can
i
be
otherwise
than
discomposed
brother
continued
he
when
i
am
in
so
short
a
time
to
see
you
sacrificed
in
the
prime
of
youth
and
vigour
to
my
own
obstinacy
and
pride
perhaps
i
beg
that
you
will
not
think
of
it
or
take
it
at
all
to
heart
said
the
youth
i
have
made
up
my
mind
and
can
look
death
in
the
face
without
unbecoming
dismay
i
should
have
preferred
dying
on
the
field
of
honour
with
my
sword
in
my
hand
rather
than
being
hanged
up
between
the
hosts
like
a
spy
or
common
malefactor
but
let
the
tears
that
are
shed
for
richard
be
other
than
salt
brine
from
the
eyes
of
the
englishmen
let
them
be
the
drops
of
purple
blood
from
the
hearts
of
our
enemies
i
charge
you
by
the
spirits
of
our
fathers
whom
i
am
so
shortly
to
join
and
by
the
blessed
trinity
that
you
act
in
this
trying
dilemma
as
the
son
of
the
house
you
represent
shed
not
a
tear
for
me
but
revenge
my
death
on
the
haughty
house
of
douglas
there
is
my
hand
here
is
my
sword
but
the
vital
motion
or
the
light
of
reason
who
shall
ensure
to
me
till
these
things
are
fulfilled
nay
who
shall
ensure
them
to
this
wasted
frame
for
one
moment
i
am
not
the
man
i
have
been
brother
but
here
i
will
swear
to
you
by
all
the
host
of
heaven
to
revenge
your
death
or
die
in
the
fulfilment
of
my
vow
yes
fully
will
i
revenge
it
i
will
waste
waste
waste
and
the
fire
that
is
begun
within
shall
be
quenched
and
no
tongue
shall
utter
it
ha
ha
ha
shall
it
not
be
so
brother
this
is
mere
raving
brother
i
have
nothing
from
this
no
it
is
not
for
there
is
a
fire
that
you
wot
not
of
but
i
will
quench
it
though
with
my
own
blood
brother
there
is
one
thing
i
wish
to
know
and
for
that
purpose
did
i
come
hither
do
you
think
it
behoves
me
to
suffer
you
to
perish
in
this
affair
that
depends
entirely
upon
your
internal
means
of
defence
answered
richard
if
there
is
a
certainty
or
even
a
probability
that
the
castle
can
hold
until
relieved
by
our
friends
which
will
not
likely
be
previous
to
the
time
you
have
appointed
for
them
to
attempt
it
why
then
i
would
put
no
account
on
the
life
of
one
man
were
i
in
your
place
i
would
retain
my
integrity
in
opposition
to
the
views
of
douglas
but
if
it
is
apparent
to
you
who
know
all
your
own
resources
that
the
castle
must
yield
it
is
needless
to
throw
away
the
life
of
your
brother
sacrificing
it
to
the
pride
of
opposition
for
a
day
or
a
week
musgrave
seemed
to
be
paying
no
regard
to
this
heroic
and
disinterested
reasoning
for
he
was
still
pacing
to
and
fro
gnawing
his
lip
and
if
he
was
reasoning
or
thinking
at
all
was
following
out
the
train
of
his
own
unstable
because
if
i
were
sure
said
he
that
you
felt
that
i
was
acting
unkindly
or
unnaturally
by
you
by
the
rood
i
would
carve
the
man
into
fragments
that
would
oppose
my
submission
to
save
my
brother
i
would
teach
them
that
musgrave
was
not
to
be
thwarted
in
his
command
of
the
castle
that
was
taken
by
his
own
might
and
device
and
to
the
government
of
which
his
sovereign
appointed
him
if
a
dog
should
dare
to
bay
at
me
in
opposition
to
my
will
whatever
it
were
i
would
muzzle
the
hound
and
make
him
repent
his
audacity
my
noble
brother
said
richard
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
frenzy
no
one
is
opposing
your
will
and
i
well
believe
no
one
within
the
castle
will
attempt
it
because
they
dare
not
said
he
furiously
interrupting
his
brother
they
dare
not
i
tell
you
but
if
they
durst
what
do
you
think
i
would
do
ha
ha
ha
douglas
overheard
all
this
and
judging
it
a
fit
time
to
interfere
immediately
a
knight
opened
the
door
of
the
apartment
where
the
two
brothers
conversed
and
announced
the
lord
douglas
musgrave
composed
himself
with
wonderful
alacrity
and
the
greeting
between
the
two
great
chiefs
though
dignified
was
courteous
and
apparently
free
of
rancour
or
jealousy
douglas
first
addressed
his
rival
as
follows
i
crave
pardon
knights
for
thus
interrupting
you
i
will
again
leave
you
to
yourselves
but
i
judged
it
incumbent
on
me
as
a
warrior
and
a
knight
of
honour
to
come
before
you
settled
finally
on
your
mode
of
procedure
and
conjure
you
lord
philip
musgrave
to
save
the
life
of
your
brother
certainly
you
will
not
put
down
my
brave
brother
lord
douglas
said
musgrave
interrupting
him
as
certainly
returned
he
as
you
put
down
my
two
kinsmen
cleland
and
douglas
of
rowlaw
in
mere
spite
and
wanton
cruelty
because
they
were
beloved
and
respected
by
me
i
am
blameless
as
it
was
yourself
who
began
this
unwarrantable
system
and
my
word
is
passed
sir
richard
must
die
unless
the
keys
of
the
castle
are
delivered
to
me
before
friday
at
noon
but
i
shall
be
blameless
in
any
thing
further
i
conjure
you
to
save
him
and
as
an
inducement
assure
you
by
the
honour
of
knighthood
that
your
resistance
is
not
only
unnatural
but
totally
useless
for
i
have
the
means
of
commanding
your
submission
when
i
please
lord
douglas
i
defy
thee
answered
musgrave
you
hold
the
life
in
your
hand
that
i
hold
dearest
on
earth
save
one
for
these
two
would
i
live
or
die
but
since
thy
inveterate
enmity
will
not
be
satisfied
with
ought
short
of
the
life
of
my
only
brother
take
it
and
may
my
curse
and
the
curse
of
heaven
be
your
guerdon
it
shall
only
render
the
other
doubly
dear
to
me
and
for
her
sake
will
i
withstand
your
proud
pretensions
and
as
she
enjoined
me
hold
this
castle
with
all
its
perils
till
the
expiry
of
the
christmas
holidays
in
spite
of
you
i
defy
your
might
and
your
ire
let
your
cruel
nature
have
its
full
sway
let
it
be
gorged
with
the
blood
of
my
kinsfolk
it
shall
only
serve
to
make
my
opposition
the
stronger
and
more
determined
for
the
sake
of
her
whom
i
serve
the
mistress
of
my
heart
and
soul
i
will
hold
my
do
your
worst
so
be
it
said
douglas
remember
that
i
do
not
like
you
fight
only
in
the
enthusiasm
of
love
and
chivalry
but
for
the
very
being
of
my
house
i
will
stick
at
no
means
of
retaliating
the
injuries
you
have
done
to
me
and
mine
however
unjustifiable
these
may
appear
to
some
no
act
of
cruelty
to
attain
the
prize
for
which
i
contend
little
do
you
know
what
you
are
doomed
to
suffer
and
that
in
a
short
space
of
time
i
again
conjure
you
to
save
the
life
of
your
brother
by
yielding
up
to
me
your
right
and
your
conditions
shall
be
as
liberal
as
you
can
desire
i
will
yield
you
my
estate
to
save
my
brother
but
not
the
castle
of
roxburgh
name
any
other
ransom
but
that
and
i
will
treat
with
you
ask
what
i
can
grant
with
honour
and
command
it
would
you
give
up
the
life
of
a
brave
only
brother
to
gratify
the
vanity
and
whim
of
a
romantic
girl
who
if
present
herself
would
plead
for
the
life
of
sir
richard
maugre
all
other
considerations
else
she
has
not
the
feelings
of
woman
what
would
you
give
lord
musgrave
to
see
that
lady
and
hear
her
sentiments
on
the
subject
i
would
give
much
to
see
her
but
rather
than
see
her
in
this
place
i
would
give
all
the
world
and
my
life
blood
into
the
bargain
but
of
that
i
need
not
have
any
fear
you
have
conjurors
among
you
it
is
said
and
witches
that
can
raise
up
the
dead
but
their
power
extends
not
to
the
living
else
who
of
my
race
would
have
been
left
i
have
more
power
than
you
divine
and
i
will
here
give
you
a
simple
specimen
of
it
to
convince
you
how
vain
it
is
to
contend
with
me
you
are
waging
war
with
your
own
vain
imagination
and
suffer
all
this
wretchedness
for
a
thing
that
has
neither
being
nor
name
douglas
then
lifted
a
small
gilded
bugle
that
hung
always
at
his
sword
belt
the
language
of
which
was
well
known
to
all
the
army
and
on
that
he
gave
two
blasts
not
louder
than
a
common
whistle
when
instantly
the
door
of
the
apartment
opened
and
there
entered
lady
jane
howard
leaning
on
her
female
attendant
dressed
in
attire
of
princely
magnificence
lady
jane
howard
exclaimed
sir
richard
starting
up
and
struggling
with
his
fettered
arms
to
embrace
her
but
when
the
vision
met
the
eyes
of
lord
musgrave
he
uttered
a
shuddering
cry
of
horror
and
sprung
with
a
convulsive
leap
back
into
the
corner
of
the
tent
there
he
stood
like
the
statue
of
distraction
with
his
raised
hands
pressed
to
each
side
of
his
helmet
as
if
he
had
been
strenuously
holding
his
head
from
splitting
asunder
so
friend
and
foe
have
combined
against
me
cried
he
wildly
earth
and
hell
have
joined
their
forces
in
opposition
to
one
impotent
human
thing
and
what
his
crime
he
presumed
on
no
more
than
what
he
did
and
could
have
done
but
who
can
stand
against
the
powers
of
darkness
and
the
unjust
decrees
of
heaven
yes
unjust
i
say
unjust
down
with
all
decrees
to
the
centre
there
no
truth
in
heaven
i
weened
there
was
but
it
is
as
false
as
the
rest
i
say
as
false
falser
than
both
brave
all
the
three
ha
ha
ha
douglas
had
brought
lady
jane
the
apparel
and
commanded
her
to
dress
in
it
and
perceiving
the
stern
authoritative
nature
of
the
chief
she
judged
it
meet
to
comply
at
first
she
entered
with
a
languid
dejected
look
for
she
had
been
given
to
understand
something
of
the
rueful
nature
of
the
meeting
she
was
called
on
to
attend
but
when
she
heard
the
above
infuriated
rhapsody
and
turned
her
eyes
in
terror
to
look
on
the
speaker
whose
voice
she
well
knew
she
uttered
a
scream
and
fainted
douglas
supported
her
in
his
arms
and
sir
richard
whose
arms
were
in
fetters
stood
and
wept
over
her
but
musgrave
himself
only
strode
to
and
fro
over
the
floor
of
the
pavilion
and
uttered
now
and
then
a
frantic
laugh
that
is
well
that
is
well
exclaimed
he
just
as
it
should
be
i
hope
she
will
not
recover
surely
she
will
not
and
then
bending
himself
back
and
clasping
his
hands
together
he
cried
fervently
o
mother
of
god
take
her
to
thyself
while
she
is
yet
pure
and
uncontaminated
or
what
heart
of
flesh
can
endure
the
prospect
what
a
wreck
in
nature
that
lovely
form
will
soon
be
the
lady
swoon
was
temporary
she
soon
began
to
revive
and
cast
unsettled
looks
around
in
search
of
the
object
that
had
so
overpowered
her
and
at
the
request
of
sir
richard
who
perceived
his
intemperate
mood
she
was
removed
she
was
so
struck
with
the
altered
features
looks
and
deportment
of
the
knight
who
in
her
imagination
was
every
thing
that
was
courteous
comely
and
noble
and
whom
she
had
long
considered
as
destined
to
be
her
own
that
her
heart
was
unable
to
stand
the
shock
and
her
removal
from
his
presence
was
an
act
of
humanity
she
was
supported
out
of
the
tent
by
douglas
and
her
female
relation
but
when
musgrave
saw
them
leading
her
away
he
stepped
rapidly
in
before
them
and
interposed
and
with
a
twist
of
his
body
put
his
hand
two
or
three
times
to
the
place
where
the
handle
of
his
sword
should
have
been
the
lady
lifted
her
eyes
to
him
but
there
was
no
conception
in
that
look
and
her
lovely
face
was
as
pale
as
if
the
hand
of
death
had
passed
over
it
any
one
would
have
thought
that
such
a
look
from
the
lady
of
his
love
in
such
a
forlorn
situation
and
in
the
hands
of
his
mortal
enemy
would
have
totally
uprooted
the
last
fibres
of
his
distempered
mind
but
who
can
calculate
on
the
medicine
suited
to
a
diseased
spirit
the
cures
even
of
some
bodily
diseases
are
those
that
would
poison
a
healthy
frame
so
did
it
prove
in
this
mental
one
he
lifted
his
hand
from
his
left
side
where
he
had
thrust
it
convulsively
in
search
of
his
sword
and
clapping
it
on
his
forehead
he
seemed
to
resume
the
command
of
himself
at
once
and
looked
as
calm
and
serene
as
in
the
most
collected
moments
of
his
life
when
they
were
gone
he
said
to
sir
richard
in
the
hearing
of
the
guards
brother
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
what
english
traitor
has
betrayed
that
angelic
maid
into
the
hands
of
our
enemy
to
me
it
is
incomprehensible
said
sir
richard
i
was
told
of
it
by
my
keeper
last
night
but
paid
no
regard
to
the
information
judging
it
a
piece
of
wanton
barbarity
but
now
my
soul
shudders
at
the
rest
of
the
information
that
he
added
what
more
did
the
dog
say
said
musgrave
he
said
he
had
heard
that
it
was
resolved
by
the
douglasses
that
if
you
did
not
yield
up
the
fortress
and
citadel
freely
on
or
before
the
day
of
the
conception
of
the
blessed
virgin
on
that
day
at
noon
the
lady
of
your
heart
should
be
exhibited
in
a
state
not
to
be
named
on
a
stage
erected
on
the
top
of
the
that
faces
the
western
tower
and
is
divided
from
it
only
by
the
moat
and
there
before
your
eyes
and
in
sight
of
both
hosts
compelled
to
yield
to
that
disgrace
which
barbarians
only
could
have
conceived
and
then
to
have
her
nose
cut
off
her
eyes
put
out
and
her
beauteous
frame
otherwise
disfigured
he
dares
not
for
his
soul
salvation
do
such
a
deed
said
musgrave
no
there
not
a
bloodhound
that
ever
mouthed
the
air
of
his
cursed
country
durst
do
a
deed
like
that
and
though
every
douglas
is
a
hound
confest
where
is
the
mongrel
among
them
that
durst
but
howl
of
such
an
outrage
in
nature
why
the
most
absolute
fiend
would
shrink
from
it
hell
would
disown
it
and
do
you
think
the
earth
would
bear
it
brother
suspend
your
passion
and
listen
to
the
voice
of
reason
and
of
nature
your
cause
is
lost
but
not
your
honour
you
took
and
have
kept
that
fortress
to
the
astonishment
of
the
world
but
for
what
do
you
now
fight
or
what
can
your
opposition
avail
let
me
beseech
you
not
to
throw
away
the
lives
of
those
you
love
most
on
earth
thus
wantonly
but
capitulate
on
honourable
terms
and
rescue
your
betrothed
bride
and
your
only
brother
from
the
irritated
scots
trust
not
that
they
will
stick
at
any
outrage
to
accomplish
their
aim
loth
would
i
be
to
know
our
name
were
dishonoured
by
any
pusillanimity
on
the
part
of
my
brother
but
desperate
obstinacy
is
not
bravery
i
therefore
conjure
you
to
save
me
and
her
in
whom
all
your
hopes
of
future
felicity
are
bound
up
musgrave
was
deeply
affected
and
at
that
instant
before
he
had
time
to
reply
douglas
scots
lord
you
have
overcome
me
said
he
with
a
pathos
that
could
not
be
exceeded
yes
you
have
conquered
but
not
with
your
sword
not
on
the
field
nor
on
the
wall
have
ye
turned
the
glaive
of
musgrave
but
either
by
some
infernal
power
or
else
by
chicanery
and
guile
the
everlasting
resources
of
your
cursed
nation
it
boots
not
me
to
know
how
you
came
possessed
of
this
last
and
only
remaining
pledge
of
my
submission
it
is
sufficient
you
have
it
i
yield
myself
your
prisoner
let
me
live
or
die
with
those
two
already
in
your
power
no
knight
that
must
not
be
replied
douglas
you
are
here
on
safe
conduct
and
protection
my
honour
is
pledged
and
must
not
be
forfeited
you
shall
return
in
safety
to
your
kinsmen
and
soldiers
and
act
by
their
counsel
it
is
not
prisoners
i
want
but
the
castle
of
roxburgh
which
is
the
right
of
my
sovereign
and
my
nation
clandestinely
taken
and
wrongously
held
by
you
i
am
neither
cruel
nor
severe
beyond
the
small
range
that
points
to
that
attainment
but
that
fortress
i
will
have
else
wo
be
to
you
and
all
who
advise
withholding
it
as
well
as
all
their
connexions
to
whom
the
power
of
scotland
can
extend
if
the
castle
is
not
delivered
up
before
friday
at
noon
your
brother
shall
suffer
that
you
already
know
but
at
the
same
hour
on
the
day
of
the
conception
if
it
is
still
madly
and
wantonly
detained
there
shall
be
such
a
scene
transacted
before
your
eyes
as
shall
blur
the
annals
of
the
border
for
ever
if
you
allude
to
any
injury
intended
to
the
lady
who
is
your
prisoner
said
musgrave
the
cruellest
fiend
in
hell
could
not
have
the
heart
to
hurt
such
angelic
purity
and
loveliness
and
it
would
degrade
the
honour
of
knighthood
for
ever
to
suffer
it
cruel
as
you
are
you
dare
not
injure
a
hair
of
her
head
talk
not
of
cruelty
in
me
said
douglas
if
the
knight
who
is
her
lover
will
not
save
her
how
should
i
you
have
it
in
your
power
and
certainly
it
is
you
that
behove
to
do
it
even
granting
that
the
stakes
for
which
we
fought
were
equal
the
task
of
redemption
and
the
blame
would
rest
solely
with
you
and
how
wide
is
the
difference
between
the
prizes
for
which
we
contend
i
for
my
love
my
honour
and
the
very
existence
of
my
house
and
name
and
you
for
you
know
not
what
the
miserable
pride
of
opposition
take
your
measures
my
lord
i
will
not
be
mocked
douglas
left
the
apartment
musgrave
also
arose
and
embraced
his
brother
and
as
he
parted
from
him
he
spoke
these
ominous
words
farewell
my
dear
richard
may
the
angels
that
watch
over
honour
be
your
guardians
in
the
hour
of
trial
you
know
not
what
i
have
to
endure
from
tormentors
without
and
within
but
hence
we
meet
not
again
in
this
state
of
existence
the
ties
of
love
must
be
broken
and
the
bands
of
brotherly
love
burst
asunder
nevertheless
i
will
save
you
a
long
farewell
my
brother
musgrave
was
then
conducted
back
to
the
between
two
long
files
of
soldiers
as
before
while
all
the
musicians
that
belonged
either
to
the
army
or
the
city
were
ranked
up
in
a
line
behind
them
on
the
top
of
the
great
precipice
that
the
teviot
playing
on
all
manner
of
instruments
the
blue
bonnets
wha
can
wha
with
such
a
tremendous
din
that
one
would
have
thought
every
stone
in
the
walls
of
roxburgh
was
singing
out
the
bravado

that

of

and

musgrave
douglas
was
sitting
all
alone
musing
in
a
secret
apartment
of
the
pavilion
when
he
heard
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
who
there
inquired
he
surlily
it
is
i
my
lor
said
a
petulant
treble
voice
without
aha
my
excellent
nondescript
little
fellow
colin
roy
is
it
you
why
you
may
come
in
colin
entered
dressed
in
a
most
elegant
and
whimsical
livery
and
forgetting
himself
made
the
douglas
two
or
three
graceful
courtesies
instead
of
bows
aye
hem
said
he
that
very
well
for
the
page
of
a
princess
i
suppose
you
have
been
studying
the
graces
from
your
accomplished
mistress
but
where
have
you
been
all
this
while
i
have
felt
the
loss
of
you
from
my
hand
grievously
i
have
been
waiting
on
my
royal
mistress
my
lor
informing
her
of
all
that
is
going
on
at
the
siege
and
of
your
good
fortune
in
the
late
captures
you
have
made
wherein
she
rejoices
exceedingly
and
wishes
you
all
good
fortune
and
forward
success
and
in
token
of
kind
remembrance
she
sends
you
this
heart
of
ruby
set
in
gold
and
diamonds
a
gem
that
befits
your
lordship
well
to
wear
and
many
more
matters
she
has
given
me
in
charge
my
lor
douglas
kissed
the
locket
and
put
it
in
his
bosom
and
then
uttered
abundance
of
the
extravagant
bombast
peculiar
to
that
age
he
called
her
his
guardian
angel
his
altar
of
incense
and
the
saint
of
his
devotion
the
buckler
of
his
arm
the
sword
in
his
hand
and
the
jewel
of
his
heart
do
you
think
colin
added
he
that
ever
there
was
a
maiden
born
like
this
royal
lady
of
my
love
why
my
lor
i
am
not
much
skilled
in
these
matters
but
i
believe
the
wench
my
mistress
is
well
enough
that
is
she
is
well
formed
and
yet
she
is
but
so
so
how
dare
you
you
piece
of
unparalleled
impudence
talk
of
your
royal
mistress
in
that
strain
or
where
did
you
ever
see
a
form
or
features
so
elegant
and
so
bewitchingly
lovely
do
you
think
so
well
i
glad
of
it
i
think
she
is
coarse
and
masculine
where
did
i
ever
see
such
a
form
indeed
yes
i
have
seen
a
much
finer
limb
and
an
arm
and
a
hand
too
what
think
you
of
that
for
a
hand
my
lor
and
with
that
the
urchin
clapped
his
hand
on
the
green
table
first
turning
up
the
one
side
of
it
and
then
the
other
i
say
if
that
hand
were
as
well
kept
and
that
arm
as
well
loaden
with
bracelets
and
the
fingers
with
diamond
rings
it
would
be
as
handsome
as
your
princess
of
which
you
boast
so
much
aye
and
handsomer
too
you
are
a
privileged
boy
colin
otherwise
i
would
kick
you
heartily
and
moreover
cause
you
to
be
whipped
by
the
hand
of
the
common
executioner
however
you
are
a
confidant
all
is
well
from
you
and
to
say
the
truth
yours
is
a
very
handsome
hand
for
a
boy
hand
so
is
your
arm
but
what
are
they
to
those
of
my
lovely
and
royal
margaret
mere
deformity
the
husk
to
the
wheat
indeed
my
lor
you
have
an
excellent
taste
and
a
no
less
gifted
discernment
i
can
not
conceive
of
any
earthly
being
equalling
my
beauteous
princess
whether
in
the
qualifications
of
body
or
mind
i
rejoice
to
hear
it
how
blind
love
is
why
in
sober
reality
there
is
the
lady
jane
howard
is
there
any
comparison
between
the
princess
and
that
lady
in
beauty
she
is
i
confess
a
most
exquisite
creature
colin
even
though
rival
to
my
adorable
lady
in
justice
it
must
be
acknowledged
she
is
peerless
in
beauty
i
do
not
wonder
at
musgrave
valour
when
i
see
the
object
of
it
but
why
do
you
redden
as
with
anger
boy
to
hear
my
commendations
of
that
hapless
lady
i
my
lord
how
should
i
redden
with
anger
on
my
honour
craving
my
lord
douglas
pardon
i
am
highly
pleased
i
think
she
is
much
more
beautiful
than
you
have
said
and
that
you
should
have
spoken
of
her
in
a
more
superlative
degree
and
confessed
frankly
that
you
would
willingly
exchange
your
betrothed
lady
for
her
i
can
not
chuse
but
think
her
very
beautiful
too
beautiful
indeed
with
her
blue
eyes
white
teeth
and
ruddy
lips
i
dont
like
such
bright
blue
eyes
i
could
almost
find
in
my
heart
to
scratch
them
out
she
is
so
like
a
wanton
so
you
do
wonder
at
lord
musgrave
valour
after
having
seen
his
mistress
well
i
advise
your
lordship
your
captainship
and
your
besiegership
that
there
are
some
who
wonder
very
much
at
your
want
of
valour
i
tell
you
this
in
confidence
my
mistress
thinks
you
hold
her
charms
only
at
a
small
avail
that
you
have
not
that
castle
long
ago
and
turned
out
these
englishmen
or
hung
them
up
by
the
necks
if
they
refused
musgrave
went
in
and
took
it
at
once
for
the
favour
of
his
mistress
because
forsooth
he
deemed
her
worthy
of
the
honour
of
such
a
bold
emprize
why
then
do
not
you
do
the
same
my
mistress
to
be
sure
is
a
woman
a
very
woman
but
she
says
this
that
it
is
superabundantly
ungallant
of
you
not
to
have
and
taken
possession
of
the
castle
long
ago
do
you
know
that
poor
kind
creature
she
has
retired
to
a
convent
where
she
continues
in
a
state
of
sufferance
using
daily
invocations
at
the
shrines
of
saints
for
your
success
and
she
has
moreover
made
a
vow
not
to
braid
her
hair
nor
dress
herself
in
princely
apparel
until
the
day
of
your
final
success
surely
my
lor
you
ought
take
that
and
relieve
my
dear
mistress
from
this
durance
i
almost
weep
when
i
think
of
her
and
must
say
with
her
that
she
has
been
shabbily
used
and
that
she
has
reason
to
envy
lady
jane
howard
even
in
her
captivity
colin
you
are
abundantly
impertinent
but
there
is
no
stopping
of
your
tongue
once
it
is
set
as
to
the
taking
of
castles
these
things
come
not
under
the
cognizance
of
boys
or
women
but
indeed
i
knew
not
that
my
sovereign
lady
the
princess
had
absconded
from
the
courtly
circle
of
her
father
palace
and
betaken
herself
to
a
convent
on
my
account
every
thing
that
i
hear
of
that
jewel
endears
her
to
me
the
more
what
even
her
orders
for
you
go
into
the
and
put
out
the
english
i
assure
you
my
lor
she
insists
upon
it
whether
it
is
her
impatience
to
be
your
bride
i
know
not
but
she
positively
will
not
be
satisfied
unless
you
very
soon
into
that
and
put
the
englishmen
all
to
the
outside
of
it
where
you
are
now
or
hang
them
and
bury
them
out
of
sight
before
she
visits
the
place
to
congratulate
you
boy
i
have
no
patience
with
you
cease
your
prating
and
inform
me
where
my
beloved
mistress
is
that
i
may
instantly
visit
her
no
not
for
the
douglas
estate
which
is
now
in
the
fire
and
may
soon
be
brought
to
the
anvil
will
i
inform
you
of
that
but
my
lor
you
know
i
must
execute
my
commission
and
i
tell
you
again
unless
you
take
this
castle
very
soon
you
will
not
only
lose
the
favour
of
my
mistress
but
you
will
absolutely
break
her
heart
nothing
less
will
satisfy
her
i
told
her
there
was
a
great
moat
more
than
a
hundred
feet
deep
and
as
many
wide
that
surrounded
the
castle
and
flowed
up
to
the

there

hole
through

no

douglas
frowning
and
stamping
with
his
foot
peace
and
leave
the
pavilion
instantly
colin
went
away
visibly
repressing
a
laugh
which
irritated
douglas
still
the
more
and
as
the
urchin
went
he
muttered
in
a
crying
whine
my
mistress
is
very
shabbily
used
very
shabbily
to
have
promised
herself
to
a
knight
if
he
will
but
take
a
castle
for
her
and
to
have
fasted
and
prayed
and
vowed
vows
for
him
and
yet
he
dares
not
go
in
and
take
it
and
i
am
shabbily
used
too
and
that
i
tell
her
turned
out
before
i
get
half
her
message
delivered
but
i
must
inform
you
my
lor
before
i
go
that
since
you
are
making
no
better
use
of
the
advantage
given
you
i
demand
the
prisoners
back
that
i
lodged
in
your
hand
in
my
lady
mistress
name
and
by
her
orders
i
will
do
no
such
thing
to
the
whim
of
a
teasing
impertinent
stripling
without
my
lady
princess
hand
and
seal
for
it
said
douglas
you
shall
not
long
want
that
said
colin
and
pulling
a
letter
out
from
below
his
sash
he
gave
it
to
him
it
was
the
princess
hand
and
seal
it
being
an
easy
matter
for
colin
to
get
what
letters
he
listed
douglas
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
lord
douglas
in
token
of
my
best
wishes
for
your
success
i
send
you
these
with
greeting
i
hope
you
will
take
immediate
advantage
of
the
high
superiority
afforded
you
in
this
contest
by
putting
some
indelible
mark
or
public
stain
on
the
lusty
dame
i
put
into
your
hands
if
musgrave
be
a
knight
of
any
gallantry
he
will
never
permit
it
but
yield
as
i
can
not
attend
personally
i
request
that
the
mode
and
degree
of
punishment
you
inflict
may
be
left
to
my
page
colin
that
you
have
not
been
successful
by
such
means
already
hath
much
surprised
margaret
this
is
not
a
requisition
to
give
you
up
the
prisoners
said
douglas
but
merely
a
request
that
the
punishment
inflicted
may
be
left
to
you
a
request
which
must
not
be
denied
to
the
lady
of
my
heart
now
pray
master
colin
roy
macalpin
what
punishment
do
you
decree
for
the
lady
jane
howard
for
my
part
though
i
intended
to
threaten
the
most
obnoxious
treatment
to
induce
my
opponent
to
yield
i
could
not
for
my
dearest
interests
injure
the
person
of
that
exquisite
lady
you
could
not
in
good
troth
i
suppose
my
mistress
has
good
reason
to
be
jealous
of
you
two
but
since
the
power
is
left
with
me
i
shall
prevent
that
i
shall
see
her
punished
as
she
deserves
i
have
no
shameful
exposures
of
a
woman
even
were
she
the
meanest
plebeian
but
i
mar
her
beauty
that
she
thinks
so
much
of
and
that
think
so
much
of
i
have
have
her
nose
cut
off
and
two
of
her
fore
teeth
drawn
and
her
cheeks
and
brow
scolloped
i
spoil
the
indecent
brightness
of
her
gloss
she
shall
not
sparkle
with
such
brilliance
again
nor
shall
the
men
gloat
feasting
their
intolerable
eyes
on
her
as
they
do
at
present
saint

exclaimed
the
douglas
what
an
unnatural
tyger
cat
it
is
i
have
heard
that
such
feelings
were
sometimes
entertained
by
one
sovereign
beauty
toward
another
of
the
same
sex
but
that
a
sprightly
youth
of
an
amorous
complexion
with
bright
blushing
features
and
carroty
locks
should
so
depreciate
female
beauty
and
thirst
to
deface
it
surpasses
any
thing
i
have
witnessed
in
the
nature
of
man
go
to
you
are
a
perverse
boy

shall
be
humoured
as
far
as
my
honour
and
character
as
a

warrior
will
admit
colin

lightly
away
making
a
slight
and
graceful
courtesy
to
the
douglas
as
he
glided
out
what
an
extraordinary
wayward
and
accomplished
youth
that
is
said
the
chief
to
himself
is
it
not
strange
that
i
should
converse
so
long
with
a
page
as
if
he
were
my
equal
there
is
something
in
his
manner
and
voice
that
overcomes
me
and
though
he
teazes
me
beyond
endurance
there
is
a
sort
of
enchantment
about
him
that
i
can
not
give
him
the
check
ah
me
all
who
submit
themselves
to
women
to
be
swayed
by
them
or
their
delegates
will
find
themselves
crossed
in
every
action
of
importance
i
am
resolved

no

shall
sway
me
i
can
love
but

not

retired
to
his
little
apartment
in
the
pavilion
it
was
close
to
the
apartment
that
douglas
occupied
while
he
remained
there
and
not
much
longer
or
broader
than
the
beautiful
and
romantic
inhabitant
yet
there
he
constantly
abode
when
not
employed
about
his
lord
and
never
mixed
or
conversed
with
the
other
pages
douglas
retired
down
to
the
tower
or
king
house
as
it
was
called
from
king
edward
having
occupied
it
at
even
tide
but
colin
roy
remained
in
his
apartment
at
the
pavilion
alas
that
douglas
did
not
know
the
value
of
the
life
he
left
exposed
in
such
a
place
on
the
return
of
musgrave
into
the
castle
a
council
of
all
the
gentlemen
in
the
fortress
was
called
and
with
eager
readiness
they
attended
in
the
hall
of
the
great
western
tower
the
governor
related
to
them
the
intelligence
of
his
mistress
being
in
the
hands
of
their
enemies
and
of
the
horrid
fate
that
awaited
her
as
well
as
his
only
brother
provided
the
garrison
stood
out
every
one
present
perceived
that
musgrave
inclined
to
capitulate
and
as
they
all
admired
him
they
pitied
his
woeful
plight
but
no
one
ventured
a
remark
there
they
sat
a
silent
circle
in
bitter
and
obstinate
rumination
their
brows
were
plaited
down
so
as
almost
to
cover
their
eyes
their
under
lips
were
bent
upward
and
every
mouth
shaped
like
a
curve
and
their
arms
were
crossed
on
their
breasts
while
every
man
right
hand
instinctively
rested
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
musgrave
had
taken
his
measures
whichever
way
the
tide
should
run
in
consequence
of
this
he
appeared
more
calm
and
collected
at
this
meeting
than
he
had
done
for
many
a
day
i
do
not
my
friends
and
soldiers
propose
any
alternative
said
he
i
merely
state
to
you
the
circumstances
in
which
we
are
placed
and
according
to
your
sentiments
i
mean
to
conduct
myself
it
is
nobly
said
brave
captain
said
collingwood
our
case
is
indeed
a
hard
one
but
not
desperate
the
scots
can
not
take
the
castle
from
us
and
shall
any
one
life
or
any
fifty
lives
induce
us
to
yield
them
the
triumph
and
all
our
skill
our
bravery
and
our
sufferings
go
for
nought
we
have
nothing
to
eat
said
musgrave
i
eat
the
one
arm
and
defend
the
with
the
other
before
the
scots
shall
set
a
foot
in
the
castle
said
a
young
man
named
henry
clavering
so
will
i
said
another
so
will
i
so
will
we
all
echoed
through
the
hall
while
a
wild
gleam
of
ferocity
fired
every
haggard
countenance
it
was
evident
that
the
demon
of
animosity
and
revenge
was
now
conjured
up
which
to
lay
was
not
in
the
power
of
man
what
then
do
you
propose
as
our
mode
of
action
in
this
grievous
dilemma
said
musgrave
i
for
my
part
would
propose
decision
and
ample
retaliation
said
clavering
do
you
not
perceive
that
there
has
been
a
great
storm
in
the
uplands
last
night
and
this
morning
and
that
the
tweed
and
teviot
are
roaring
like
two
whirlpools
of
the
ocean
so
that
neither
man
nor
beast
can
cross
them
there
is
no
communication
between
the
two
great
divisions
of
the
scottish
army
to
night
save
by
that
narrow
passage
betwixt
the
moat
and
the
river
let
us
issue
forth
at
the
deepest
hour
of
midnight
secure
that
narrow
neck
of
land
by
a
strong
guard
while
the
rest
proceed
sword
in
hand
to
the
eastern
camp
surround
the
pavilion
of
douglas
and
take
him
and
all
his
associates
prisoners
and
then
see
who
is
most
forward
in
using
the
rope
it
is
gallantly
proposed
my
brave
young
friend
said
musgrave
i
will
lead
the
onset
myself
i
do
not
only
ween
the
scheme
practicable
but
highly
promising
and
if
we
can
make
good
that
narrow
neck
of
land
against
our
enemies
on
the
first
alarm
i
see
not
why
we
may
not
cut
off
every
man
in
the
eastern
division
of
their
army
and
haply
from
the
camp
and
city
secure
to
ourselves
a
good
supply
of
provisions
before
the
break
of
the
day
these
were
inducements
not
to
be
withstood
and
there
was
not
one
dissenting
voice
a
gloomy
satisfaction
rested
on
every
brow
and
pervaded
every
look
taking
place
of
dark
and
hideous
incertitude
like
a
winter
day
that
has
threatened
a
tempest
from
the
break
of
the
morning
but
becomes
at
last
no
longer
doubtful
as
the
storm
descends
on
the
mountain
tops
so
was
the
scene
at
the
breaking
up
of
that
meeting
and
all
was
activity
and
preparation
within
the
castle
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
the
evening
at
last
came
but
it
was
no
ordinary
evening
the
storm
had
increased
in
a
tenfold
degree
the
wind
roared
like
thunder
the
sleet
descended
in
torrents
and
was
driven
with
an
impetuosity
that
no
living
creature
could
withstand
the
rivers
foamed
from
bank
to
brae
and
the
darkness
was
such
as
if
the
heavens
had
been
sealed
up
the
sound
of
the
great
abbey
bell
that
rung
for
vespers
was
borne
away
on
the
tempest
so
that
nothing
was
heard
save
once
or
twice
a
solemn
melancholy
sound
apparently
at
a
great
distance
as
if
a
spirit
had
been
moaning
in
the
eastern
sky
animal
nature
cowered
beneath
the
blast
the
hind
left
not
her
den
in
the
wood
nor
broke
her
fast
until
the
dawning
the
flocks
crowded
together
for
shelter
in
the
small
hollows
of
the
mountains
and
the
cattle
lowed
and
bellowed
in
the
shade
the
scottish
soldiers
dozed
under
their
plaids
or
rested
on
their
arms
within
the
shelter
of
their
tents
and
trenches
even
the
outer
sentinels
on
whose
vigilance
all
depended
crept
into
some
retreat
or
other
that
was
next
to
hand
to
shield
them
from
the
violence
of
the
storm
the
army
was
quite
secure
for
they
had
the
garrison
so
entirely
cooped
up
within
their
walls
that
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
sally
forth
for
a
whole
month
indeed
ever
since
the
english
were
fairly
dislodged
from
the
city
the
and
all
the
other
outworks
the
attempt
was
no
more
dreaded
for
the
heaving
up
of
the
portcullis
and
the
letting
down
of
the
made
such
a
noise
as
at
once
alarmed
the
scottish
watchers
and
all
were
instantly
on
the
alert
besides
the
gates
and
for
there
were
two
gates
and
one
at
each
end
were
so
narrow
that
it
took
a
long
time
for
an
enemy
to
pass
in
any
force
and
thus
it
proved
an
easy
matter
to
prevent
them
but
that
night
the
storm
howling
in
such
majesty
and
the
constant
jangling
of
chains
and
pullies
swinging
to
its
force
with
the
roaring
of
the
two
rivers
over
the
dams
formed
altogether
such
a
hellish
concert
that
fifty
portcullises
might
have
been
raised
and
as
many
let
down
and
the
prostrate
shivering
sentinels
of
the
scottish
army
have
distinguished
no
additional
chord
or
octave
in
the
infernal
bravura
at
midnight
the
english
issued
forth
with
all
possible
silence
two
hundred
under
the
command
of
grey
and
collingwood
were
posted
on
the
that
is
the
narrow
valley
between
the
moat
and
the
river
tweed
to
prevent
the
junction
of
the
two
armies
on
the
first
alarm
being
given
the
rest
were
parted
into
two
divisions
and
under
the
command
of
musgrave
and
henry
clavering
went
down
the
side
of
each
river
so
as
to
avoid
the
strongest
part
of
the
scottish
lines
and
the
ramparts
raised
on
the
height
clavering
led
his
division
down
by
the
side
of
the
teviot
along
the
bottom
of
the
great
precipice
and
owing
to
the
mingled
din
of
the
flood
and
the
storm
was
never
perceived
till
fairly
in
the
rear
of
the
scottish
lines
musgrave
was
not
so
fortunate
as
the
main
trench
ran
close
to
the
tweed
he
was
obliged
to
force
it
with
his
first
column
which
he
did
with
a
rapidity
which
nothing
could
equal
the
englishmen
threw
themselves
over
the
mound
of
the
great
trench
hurling
in
above
their
enemies
sword
in
hand
and
overpowering
them
with
great
ease
then
over
one
breastwork
after
another
spreading
consternation
before
them
and
carnage
behind
clavering
heard
nothing
of
this
turmoil
so
intemperate
was
the
night
he
stood
with
impatience
his
men
drawn
up
in
order
within
half
a
of
douglas
pavilion
waiting
for
the
signal
agreed
on
for
their
whole
energy
was
to
be
bent
against
the
tent
of
the
commander
in
hopes
not
only
to
capture
the
douglas
himself
and
all
his
near
kinsmen
but
likewise
their
own
prisoners
at
length
among
other
sounds
that
began
to
swell
around
clavering
heard
the
welcome
cry
of
duddoe
away
which
was
as
readily
answered
with
duddoe
here
and
at
one
moment
the
main
camp
was
attacked
on
both
sides
the
flyers
from
the
lines
had
spread
the
alarm
the
captain
tent
was
surrounded
by
a
triple
circle
of
lesser
tents
all
full
of
armed
men
who
instantly
grasped
their
weapons
and
stood
on
the
defensive
many
rough
blows
were
exchanged
at
the
first
onset
and
many
of
the
first
ranks
of
the
assailants
met
their
death
but
though
those
within
fought
with
valour
they
fought
without
system
whereas
the
english
had
arranged
every
thing
previously
and
each
of
them
had
a
white
linen
belt
of
which
the
scots
knew
nothing
and
in
the
hurry
and
terror
that
ensued
some
parties
attacked
each
other
and
fell
by
the
hands
of
their
brethren
finding
soon
that
the
battle
raged
before
and
behind
them
they
fled
with
precipitation
toward
the
city
but
there
they
were
waylaid
by
a
strong
party
and
many
of
them
captured
and
slain
the
english
would
have
slain
every
man
that
fell
into
their
power
had
it
not
been
for
the
hopes
of
taking
douglas
or
some
of
his
near
kinsmen
and
by
that
means
redeeming
the
precious
pledges
that
the
scots
held
so
much
to
their
detriment
and
by
which
all
their
motions
were
paralyzed
clavering
with
a
part
of
the
troops
under
his
command
pursued
the
flyers
that
escaped
as
far
as
the
head
of
the
and
put
the
great
douglas
himself
into
no
little
dismay
for
he
found
it
next
to
impossible
to
rally
his
men
amid
the
storm
and
darkness
such
a
panic
had
seized
them
by
this
forthbreaking
of
their
enemies
clavering
would
doubtless
have
rifled
a
part
of
the
city
if
not
totally
ruined
that
division
of
the
scottish
army
had
he
not
been
suddenly
called
back
to
oppose
a
more
dangerous
inroad
behind
when
musgrave
first
broke
through
the
right
wing
of
the
scottish
lines
the
noise
and
uproar
spread
amain
as
may
well
be
conceived
the
warders
on
the
heights
then
sounded
the
alarm
incessantly
and
a
most
incongrous
thing
it
was
to
hear
them
sounding
the
alarm
with
such
vigour
at
their
posts
after
the
enemy
had
passed
quietly
by
them
and
at
that
time
were
working
havoc
in
the
middle
of
their
camp
they
knew
not
what
was
astir
but
they
made
plenty
of
din
with
their
leaving
those
that
they
alarmed
to
find
out
the
cause
the
best
way
they
could
the
scottish
army
that
beleaguered
the
castle
to
the
westward
caught
the
alarm
and
rushed
to
the
support
of
their
brethren
and
commander
the
infantry
being
first
in
readiness
were
first
put
in
motion
but
on
the
narrowest
part
of
the
castle
green
they
fell
in
with
the
firm
set
phalanx
of
the
english
who
received
them
on
the
point
of
their
lances
and
in
a
few
seconds
made
them
give
way
the
english
could
not
however
pursue
their
orders
being
to
keep
by
the
spot
where
they
were
and
stand
firm
so
that
the
scots
had
nothing
ado
but
to
rally
at
the
head
of
the
green
and
return
to
the
charge
still
it
was
with
no
better
success
than
before
the
english
stood
their
ground
and
again
made
them
reel
and
retreat
but
by
this
time
the
horsemen
were
got
ready
and
descended
to
the
charge
at
a
sharp
trot
they
were
clad
in
armour
and
had
heavy
swords
by
their
sides
and
long
spears
like
halberds
in
their
hands
the
english
lines
could
not
withstand
the
shock
given
by
these
for
the
men
were
famishing
with
hunger
and
benumbed
with
cold
the
wind
blowing
with
all
its
fury
straight
in
their
faces
they
gave
way
but
they
were
neither
broken
nor
dispersed
reduced
as
they
were
they
were
all
veterans
and
retreated
fighting
till
they
came
to
the
barriers
before
the
and
there
having
the
advantage
of
situation
they
stood
their
ground
the
horsemen
passed
on
to
the
scene
of
confusion
in
the
camp
and
came
upon
the
rear
of
the
english
host
encumbered
with
prisoners
and
spoil
when
clavering
was
called
back
douglas
who
had
now
rallied
about
one
hundred
and
forty
men
around
him
wheeled
about
and
followed
clavering
in
the
rear
so
that
the
english
found
themselves
in
the
same
predicament
that
the
scots
were
in
about
an
hour
before
beset
before
and
behind
and
that
principally
by
horsemen
which
placed
them
under
a
manifest
disadvantage
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
adequate
idea
of
the
uproar
and
desperate
affray
that
now
ensued
the
english
formed
on
both
sides
to
defend
themselves
but
the
prisoners
being
numerous
detained
a
great
part
of
the
men
from
the
combat
a
cry
arose
to
kill
the
prisoners
from
whom
it
first
issued
no
one
knew
but
it
no
sooner
past
than
the
men
began
to
put
it
into
execution
the
order
was
easier
to
give
than
perform
in
half
a
minute
every
one
of
the
guards
had
a
prisoner
at
his
throat
the
battle
became
general
every
one
being
particularly
engaged
through
all
the
interior
of
the
host
many
of
them
struggling
in
pairs
on
the
earth
who
to
get
uppermost
and
have
the
mastery
it
was
all
for
life
and
no
exertion
was
withheld
but
whenever
these
single
combats
ended
in
close
gripes
the
scots
had
the
mastery
their
bodies
being
in
so
much
better
condition
they
made
a
great
noise
both
individually
and
in
their
files
but
the
english
scarcely
opened
their
mouths
like
bred
mastiffs
when
desperately
engaged
they
only
aimed
at
the
vital
parts
of
their
opponents
without
letting
their
voices
be
heard
it
is
vain
at
this
period
to
attempt
giving
a
better
description
of
the
scenes
of
that
night
for
the
men
that
were
present
in
the
affray
could
give
no
account
of
it
next
day
but
after
a
hard
encounter
and
heavy
loss
the
english
fought
their
way
up
to
their
friends
before
the
ramparts
who
had
all
the
while
been
engaged
in
skirmishing
with
the
foot
of
the
western
division
whom
they
had
kept
at
bay
and
thus
preserved
the
entrance
clear
to
themselves
and
brethren
but
ere
the
rear
had
got
over
the
before
the
bridge
it
was
heaped
full
of
slain
there
were
more
of
the
scots
slain
during
the
conflict
of
that
hideous
night
than
of
the
english
but
by
far
the
greater
number
of
prisoners
remained
with
the
former
and
several
of
them
were
men
of
note
but
such
care
was
taken
to
conceal
rank
and
titles
after
falling
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
that
they
could
only
be
guessed
at
de
gray
was
slain
and
collingwood
was
wounded
and
taken
so
that
on
taking
a
muster
next
day
the
english
found
themselves
losers
by
their
heroic
sally
they
had
however
taken
one
prize
of
which
had
they
known
the
value
it
would
have
proved
a
counterbalance
for
all
their
losses
and
all
the
distinguished
prisoners
that
formerly
told
against
them
this
was
no
other
than
the
pretended
page
colin
roy
of
whose
sex
and
quality
the
reader
has
been
formerly
apprised
and
whom
they
found
concealed
among
some
baggage
in
the
douglas
tent
grievous
was
that
page
plight
when
he
found
himself
thrust
into
a
vault
below
the
castle
of
roxburgh
among
forty
rude
soldiers
many
of
them
wounded
and
others
and
nothing
given
them
to
subsist
on
concealment
of
his
true
sex
for
any
length
of
time
was
now
impossible
and
to
divulge
the
secret
certain
ruin
to
himself
and
the
cause
of
douglas
next
day
he
pleaded
hard
for
an
audience
of
musgrave
on
pretence
of
giving
him
some
information
that
deeply
concerned
himself
and
he
pleaded
with
such
eloquence
that
the
guards
listened
to
him
and
informed
the
commander
who
ordered
the
stripling
to
be
brought
before
him
the
next
day
following
was
that
appointed
for
the
execution
of
sir
richard
musgrave
colin
informed
the
governor
that
if
he
would
give
him
his
liberty
he
would
procure
a
reprieve
for
his
brother
at
least
until
the
day
of
the
conception
during
which
period
something
might
occur
that
would
save
the
life
of
so
brave
a
youth
that
he
was
the
only
man
on
earth
who
had
the
power
to
alter
the
purpose
of
douglas
in
that
instance
and
that
he
would
answer
with
his
head
for
the
success
only
the
charm
required
immediate
application
musgrave
said
it
was
a
coward
trick
to
preserve
his
own
life
for
how
could
he
answer
to
him
for
his
success
when
he
was
at
liberty
but
that
no
chance
might
be
lost
for
saving
his
brother
life
he
would
cause
him
to
be
conducted
to
douglas
under
a
strong
guard
allow
him
what
time
he
required
to
proffer
his
suit
and
have
him
brought
back
to
prison
till
the
day
of
the
conception
was
over
and
if
he
succeeded
he
should
then
have
his
liberty
this
was
not
exactly
what
colin
wanted
however
he
was
obliged
to
accept
of
the
terms
and
proceeded
to
the
gate
under
a
guard
of
ten
men
the
scots
officer
of
the
advanced
guard
refused
to
let
any
englishman
pass
but
answered
with
his
honour
to
conduct
the
stripling
in
safety
to
his
commander
and
in
two
hours
return
him
back
to
the
english
at
the
no
more
was
required
and
he
was
conducted
accordingly
to
the
door
of
douglas
tent
which
as
he
desired
he
was
suffered
to
enter
the
men
keeping
guard
at
the
door
in
the
confusion
of
that
morning
douglas
never
had
missed
the
page
nor
knew
he
that
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
when
the
boy
entered
from
his
own
little
apartment
he
judged
him
to
be
in
attendance
as
usual
he
had
a
bundle
below
his
arm
tied
up
in
a
lady
scarf
and
a
look
that
manifested
great
hurry
and
alarm
the
douglas
who
was
busily
engaged
with
two
knights
could
not
help
noting
his
appearance
at
which
he
smiled
my
lord
said
the
boy
i
have
an
engagement
of
great
importance
and
the
time
is
at
hand
i
can
not
get
out
at
the
door
by
reason
of
the
crowd
who
must
not
see
this
will
it
please
you
to
let
me
pass
by
your
own
private
door
into
the
city
douglas
cursed
him
for
a
troublesome
imp
and
forthwith
opened
the
door
into
the
concealed
way
and
as
all
who
came
from
that
door
passed
unquestioned
the
page
quickly
vanished
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
the
officer
and
his
guard
waited
and
waited
until
the
time
was
on
the
point
of
expiring
and
at
last
grew
quite
impatient
wondering
what
the
boy
could
be
doing
so
long
with
the
commander
but
at
length
to
their
mortal
astonishment
they
beheld
the
stripling
coming
swaggering
up
from
the
high
street
of
the
city
behind
them
putting
a
number
of
new
and
ridiculous
airs
in
practice
and
quite
unlike
one
going
to
be
delivered
up
to
enemies
to
be
thrown
into
a
dungeon
or
perhaps
hanged
like
a
dog
in
a
day
or
two
the
officer
knew
nothing
of
the
concealed
door
and
passage
and
was
lost
in
amazement
how
the
page
should
have
escaped
from
them
all
without
being
visible
but
he
wondered
still
more
how
the
elf
being
once
at
liberty
should
have
thought
of
coming
strutting
back
to
deliver
himself
up
again
where
the
devil
have
you
been
master
an
it
be
your
will
said
the
officer
eh
what
d
say
mun
said
the
unaccountable
puppy
what
do
i
say

replied
the
officer
quite
unable
to
account
either
for
the
behaviour
of
the
prisoner
or
his
address
i
say
i
trow

seen

your

and
some
more
to

i
fear
come
along
with
us
and
forthwith
one
of
their
number
waited
on
the
chief
with
the
letter
while
the
rest
hauled
off
the
unfortunate
page
and
delivered
him
back
to
the
english
chapter
ix
his
doublet
was
sae
trim
and
neat
wi
reid

chin
ye

hae
sworn
had
ye
been
there
that
a
maiden
stood
within
the
tears
they
trickled
to
his
chin
and
fell
down
on
his
knee
o
had
he
wist
before
he
kissed
that
the
boy
was
a
fair
ladye
of

who
she
this
dame
that
comes
in
such
a
guise
such
lace
of
import
and
unwonted
speech
tell
me
cornaro
for
methinks
i
see
some
traits
of
hell
about
her
of
the
in
this
perilous
situation
were
placed
the
two
most
beautiful
ladies
of
england
and
scotland
at
the
close
of
that
memorable
year
and
in
this
situation
stood
the
two
chiefs
with
relation
to
those
they
valued
dearest
in
life
the
one
quite
unconscious
of
the
misery
that
awaited
him
but
the
other
prepared
to
stand
the
severest
of
trials
success
had
for
some
time
past
made
a
show
of
favouring
the
scots
but
she
had
not
yet
declared
herself
and
matters
with
them
soon
began
to
look
worse
as
a
commencement
of
their
misfortunes
on
that
very
night
the
battle
took
place
the
english
received
a
supply
of
thirty
of
provisions
with
assurances
that
sir
thomas
musgrave
the
governor
of
berwick
was
setting
out
with
a
strong
army
to
their
succour
the
supply
was
received
in
this
way
there
was
a
bridge
over
the
teviot
which
communicated
only
with
the
castle
the
north
end
of
it
being
within
the
and
that
bridge
the
english
kept
possession
of
all
the
time
of
the
siege
it
being
of
no
avail
to
the
scots
they
contented
themselves
by
keeping
a
guard
at
the
convent
of
maisondieu
to
prevent
any
communication
between
the
fortress
and
the
border
but
the
english
barons
to
the
eastward
whose
castles
lay
contiguous
to
the
tweed
taking
advantage
of
the
great
flood
came
with
a
strong
body
of
men
and
attacking
this
post
by
surprise
they
beat
them
and
chasing
them
a
considerable
way
up
the
river
got
the
convoy
along
the
bridge
into
the
castle
this
temporary
relief
raised
the
spirits
of
the
english
or
rather
cheered
their
prospects
for
higher
in
inveterate
opposition
their
spirits
could
not
be
raised
on
the
day
following
likewise
a
flying
party
of
sir
thomas
musgrave
horse
made
their
appearance
on
the
height
above
hume
castle
and
blew
their
horns
and
tossed
their
banners
abroad
on
the
wind
that
the
besieged
might
see
them
and
understand
that
their
friends
were
astir
to
make
a
diversion
in
their
favour
on
the
same
day
a
new
gibbet
was
erected
on
the
top
of
the
with
a
shifting
wooden
battery
to
protect
the
executioners
and
all
within
the
castle
feared
that
the
stern
and
unyielding
douglas
was
going
to
put
his
threat
respecting
the
life
of
sir
richard
musgrave
into
execution
therefore
to
prevent
their
captain
from
seeing
the
scene
and
if
possible
his
mind
from
recurring
to
it
they
contrived
to
get
a
council
of
war
called
at
which
they
intentionally
argued
and
contended
about
matters
of
importance
in
order
to
detain
him
until
the
sufferings
of
his
brother
were
past
the
on
which
the
scots
had
a
strong
fortification
rises
abruptly
over
against
the
western
tower
of
the
castle
of
roxburgh
they
were
separated
only
by
the
moat
and
though
at
a
great
height
were
so
near
each
other
that
men
could
with
ease
converse
across
and
see
distinctly
what
was
done
on
the
top
of
this
battery
was
the
new
gibbet
erected
the
more
to
gall
the
english
by
witnessing
the
death
of
their
friends
at
noon
the
scots
to
the
number
of
two
hundred
came
in
procession
up
from
the
city
with
their
prisoner
dressed
in
his
knightly
robes
and
as
they
went
by
they
flouted
the
english
that
looked
on
from
the
walls
but
the
latter
answered
them
not
either
good
or
bad
by
a
circular
rout
to
the
westward
they
reached
the
height
where
they
exposed
the
prisoner
to
the
view
of
the
garrison
on
a
semicircular
platform
for
a
few
minutes
until
a
herald
made
proclamation
that
unless
the
keys
of
the
castle
were
instantly
delivered
at
the
the
life
of
the
noble
prisoner
was
forfeited
and
the
sentence
would
momently
be
put
in
execution
and
then
he
concluded
by
calling
in
a
louder
voice
answer
yes
or
no
once
twice
he
paused
for
the
space
of
twenty
seconds
and
then
repeated
slowly
and
apparently
with
reluctance
once
twice
and
the
platform
folding
down
the
victim
was
launched
into
eternity
the
english
returned
no
answer
to
the
herald
as
no
command
or
order
had
been
given
in
moody
silence
they
stood
till
they
witnessed
the
fatal
catastrophe
and
then
a
loud
groan
or
rather
growl
of
abhorrence
and
vengeance
burst
from
the
troops
on
the
wall
which
was
answered
by
the
exulting
shouts
of
the
scots
at
that
fatal
moment
musgrave
stepped
on
the
battlement
to
witness
the
last
dying
throes
of
his
loved
brother
by
some
casualty
the
day
of
the
week
and
month
happening
to
be
mentioned
in
the
council
hall
in
the
midst
of
his
confused
and
abstracted
ideas
that
brought
to
his
remembrance
the
fate
with
which
his
brother
had
been
threatened
still
he
had
hopes
that
it
would
have
been
postponed
for
as
a
drowning
man
will
catch
violently
at
floating
stubble
so
had
he
trusted
to
the
page
mediation
he
had
examined
the
stripling
on
his
return
to
the
dungeon
but
the
imp
proved
froward
and
incommunicative
attaching
to
himself
an
importance
of
which
the
captain
could
not
perceive
the
propriety
yet
though
he
had
nothing
to
depend
on
the
tender
mercies
of
douglas
as
indeed
he
had
no
right
he
nevertheless
trusted
to
his
policy
for
the
saving
of
his
brother
alive
knowing
that
in
his
life
he
held
a
bond
round
his
heart
which
it
was
not
his
interest
to
snap
as
he
left
the
hall
of
council
which
was
in
the
great
western
tower
and
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
scene
then
transacting
the
murmurs
of
the
one
host
and
the
shouts
of
the
other
drew
him
to
the
battlement
whence
his
eye
momently
embraced
the
cause
of
the
tumult
he
started
and
contracted
every
muscle
of
his
whole
frame
shrinking
downward
and
looking
madly
on
each
hand
of
him
he
seemed
in
act
to
make
a
spring
over
the
wall
and
the
soldiers
around
him
perceiving
this
and
haply
misjudging
the
intent
of
his
motion
seized
on
him
to
restrain
him
by
main
force
but
scarcely
did
he
seem
to
feel
that
he
was
held
he
stretched
out
his
hands
toward
his
brother
and
uttered
a
loud
cry
of
furious
despair
and
then
in
a
softer
tone
cried
oh
my
brother
my
brother
so
you
would
not
warn
me
you
dog
nor
you
nor
you
no
you
are
all
combined
against
me
that
was
a
sight
to
gratify
you
was
it
not
my
curse
on
you
and
all
that
have
combined
against
the
life
of
that
matchless
youth
and
with
that
he
struggled
to
shake
them
from
him
my
lord
my
lord
was
all
that
the
soldiers
uttered
as
they
restrained
him
at
that
instant
clavering
rushed
on
the
battlement
unhand
the
captain
cried
he
dare
you
for
the
lives
that
are
not
your
own
presume
to
lay
violent
restraint
on
him
and
that
in
the
full
view
of
your
enemies
i
will
have
vengeance
clavering
cried
musgrave
ample
and
uncontrolled
vengeance
where
is
the
deceitful
and
impertinent
stripling
that
promised
so
solemnly
to
gain
a
reprieve
for
my
brother
and
proffered
the
forfeit
of
his
life
if
he
failed
in
the
dungeon
my
lord
fast
and
secure
he
is
a
favourite
parasite
of
the
douglas
bring
him
forth
that
i
may
see
vengeance
executed
on
him
the
first
of
them
all
i
will
hang
every
scot
in
our
custody
but
go
and
bring
him
the
first
it
is
a
base
deceitful
cub
and
shall
dangle
opposite
to
that
noble
and
now
lifeless
form
it
is
a
poor
revenge
indeed
but
i
will
sacrifice
every
scot
of
them
why
do
you
go
and
bring
the
gilded
moth
you
kennel
knaves
know
you
to
whom
you
thus
scruple
obedience
clavering
was
silent
and
the
soldiers
durst
not
disobey
though
they
obeyed
with
reluctance
knowing
the
advantages
that
the
scots
possessed
over
them
both
in
the
numbers
and
rank
of
their
prisoners
they
went
into
the
vaults
and
without
ceremony
or
intimation
of
their
intent
lifted
the
gaudy
page
in
their
arms
and
carried
him
to
the
battlement
of
the
western
tower
from
whence
sans
farther
ceremony
he
was
suspended
from
a
beam
end
douglas
could
not
believe
the
testimony
of
his
own
senses
when
he
saw
what
had
occurred
till
that
moment
he
never
knew
that
his
page
was
a
prisoner
indeed
how
could
he
conceive
he
was
when
he
had
seen
him
in
his
tent
the
day
after
the
night
engagement
his
grief
was
of
a
cutting
and
sharp
kind
but
went
not
to
the
heart
for
though
the
boy
had
maintained
a
sort
of
influence
over
him
even
more
than
he
could
account
to
himself
for
yet
still
he
was
teasing
and
impertinent
and
it
was
not
the
sort
of
influence
he
desired
i
wish
it
been
our
blessed
lady
will
to
have
averted
this
said
he
to
himself
but
the
mischances
of
war
often
light
upon
those
least
concerned
in
the
event
poor
colin
thy
beauty
playfulness
and
flippancy
of
speech
deserved
a
better
guerdon
how
shall
i
account
to
my
royal
mistress
for
the
cruel
fate
of
her
favourite
with
all
this
partial
regret
douglas
felt
that
by
the
loss
of
this
officious
page
of
the
princess
he
would
be
freed
from
the
controul
of
he
perceived
that
the
princess
lived
in
concealment
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
kept
an
eye
over
all
his
actions
and
movements
and
by
this
her
agent
checked
or
upbraided
him
according
to
her
whimsical
inexperience
douglas
was
ambitious
of
having
the
beautiful
princess
for
his
spouse
of
being
to
his
sovereign
and
the
first
man
in
the
realm
but
he
liked
not
to
have
his
counsels
impeded
or
his
arms
checked
by
a
froward
and
romantic
girl
however
high
her
lineage
or
her
endowments
might
soar
so
that
upon
the
whole
though
he
regretted
the
death
of
colin
roy
macalpin
he
felt
like
one
released
from
a
slight
bondage
alas
noble
chief
little
didst
thou
know
of
the
pang
that
was
awaiting
thee
it
will
be
recollected
that
when
the
lady
margaret
first
arrived
in
the
campin
the
character
of
colin
her
own
page
she
lodged
her
maid
in
the
city
of
roxburgh
disguised
likewise
as
a
boy
with
her
she
communicated
every
day
and
contrived
to
forward
such
letters
to
the
court
as
satisfied
her
royal
mother
with
regard
to
the
motives
of
her
absence
though
these
letters
were
like
many
others
of
the
sex
any
thing
but
the
direct
truth
the
king
was
at
this
period
living
in
retirement
at
his
castle
of
logie
in
athol
on
pretence
of
ill
health
the
name
of
the
maiden
of
honour
thus
disguised
was
mary
kirkmichael
the
daughter
of
a
knight
in
the
shire
of
fife
she
was
a
lady
of
great
beauty
and
elegant
address
shrewd
sly
and
enterprising
two
days
after
the
rueful
catastrophe
above
related
word
was
brought
to
douglas
while
engaged
in
his
pavilion
that
a
lady
at
the
door
begged
earnestly
to
see
him
some
petitioner
for
the
life
of
a
prisoner
said
he
what
other
lady
can
have
business
with
me
tell
her
i
have
neither
leisure
nor
inclination
at
present
to
listen
to
the
complaints
and
petitions
of
women
i
have
told
her
so
already
said
the
knight
in
waiting
but
she
refuses
to
go
away
till
she
speak
with
you
in
private
and
says
that
she
has
something
to
communicate
that
deeply
concerns
your
welfare
she
is
veiled
but
seems
a
beautiful
accomplished
and
courtly
dame
at
these
words
the
douglas
started
to
his
feet
he
had
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
princess
emerged
from
her
concealment
in
the
priory
or
convent
and
come
to
make
inquiries
after
her
favourite
and
perhaps
establish
some
other
mode
of
communication
with
himself
he
laid
his
account
with
complaints
and
upbraidings
and
upon
the
whole
boded
no
great
good
from
this
domiciliary
visit
however
he
determined
to
receive
his
royal
mistress
with
some
appearance
of
form
and
in
a
few
seconds
at
a
given
word
squires
yeomen
and
grooms
to
the
amount
of
seventy
were
arranged
in
due
order
every
one
in
his
proper
place
and
up
a
lane
formed
of
these
was
the
lady
conducted
to
the
captain
who
received
her
standing
and
uncovered
but
after
exchanging
courtesies
with
her
and
perceiving
that
it
was
not
the
princess
jealous
of
his
dignity
he
put
on
his
plumed
bonnet
and
waited
with
stately
mien
the
developement
of
her
rank
and
errand
it
was
mary
kirkmichael
my
noble
lord
said
she
i
have
a
word
for
your
private
ear
and
deeply
doth
it
concern
you
and
all
this
realm
douglas
beckoned
to
his
friends
and
attendants
who
withdrew
and
left
him
alone
with
the
dame
who
began
thus
with
great
earnestness
of
manner
my
lord
of
douglas
i
have
but
one
question
to
ask
and
if
satisfied
with
the
answer
will
not
detain
you
a
moment
what
is
become
of
the
page
colin
that
attended
your
hand
of
late
douglas
hesitated
deeming
the
lady
to
be
some
agent
of
the
princess
margaret
where
is
he
continued
she
raising
her
voice
and
advancing
a
step
nearer
to
the
captain
tell
me
as
you
would
wish
your
soul
to
thrive
is
he
well
is
he
safe
he
is
sped
on
a
long
journey
lady
and
you
may
not
expect
to
meet
him
again
for
a
season
sped
on
a
long
journey
not
see
him
again
for
a
season
what
does
this
answer
mean
captain
on
that
youth
hang
the
safety
the
nobility
and
the
honour
of
your
house
say
but
to
me
he
is
well
and
not
exposed
to
any
danger
in
the
message
on
which
he
is
gone
of
his
i
have
no
doubt
and
the
message
on
which
he
is
gone
is
a
safe
one
he
is
under
protection
from
all
danger
commotion
or
strife
it
is
well
you
can
say
so
else
wo
would
have
fallen
to
your
lot
to
mine
and
to
that
of
our
nation
i
know
he
was
a
page
of
court
and
in
the
confidence
of
my
sovereign
and
adored
lady
margaret
but
how
could
any
misfortune
attending
a
page
prove
of
such
overwhelming
import
a
page
of
court
my
lord
what
do
you
infer
by
that
pray
what
is
he
now
i
entreat
of
you
to
be
more
explicit
the
plain
truth
of
the
matter
is
shortly
this
the
boy
fell
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies
that
night
of
the
late
fierce
engagement
at
this
the
lady
uttered
a
scream
and
douglas
dreading
she
would
fall
into
hysterics
stretched
out
his
arms
to
support
her
i
pity
you
gentle
maiden
said
he
for
i
perceive
you
two
have
been
lovers
she
withdrew
herself
shunning
his
profered
support
and
looking
him
wildly
in
the
face
said
in
a
passionate
voice
in
the
hands
of
the
english
o
douglas
haste
to
redeem
him
give
up
all
the
prisoners
you
have
for
that
page
ransom
and
if
these
will
not
suffice
give
up
all
the
lands
of
douglas
and
mar
and
if
all
these
are
still
judged
inadequate
give
up
yourself
but
by
your
fealty
your
honour
your
nobility
i
charge
you
and
in
the
name
of
the
blessed
virgin
i
conjure
you
to
lose
no
time
in
redeeming
that
youth
douglas
could
scarcely
contain
his
gravity
at
this
rhapsody
weening
it
the
frantic
remonstrance
of
a
maid
but
she
perceiving
the
bent
and
tenor
of
his
disposition
held
up
her
hand
as
a
check
to
his
levity
unhappy
chief
exclaimed
she
little
art
thou
aware
what
a
gulf
of
misery
and
despair
thou
art
suspended
over
and
that
by
a
single
thread
within
reach
of
the
flame
and
liable
every
moment
to
snap
and
hurl
thee
into
inevitable
ruin
know
and
to
thyself
alone
be
it
known
that
that
page
was
no
other
than
the
princess
of
scotland
herself
who
impelled
by
romantic
affection
came
in
that
disguise
to
attend
thee
in
all
thy
perils
undertaken
for
her
sake
it
was
she
herself
who
seized
her
rival
and
placed
her
in
your
hands
thus
giving
you
an
advantage
which
force
could
not
bestow
and
from
time
to
time
has
she
laid
such
injunctions
on
you
written
and
delivered
by
her
own
hand
as
she
judged
conducive
to
your
honour
or
advantage
if
you
suffer
that
inestimable
lady
to
lye
in
durance
or
one
hair
of
her
head
to
fall
to
the
ground
after
so
many
marks
of
affection
and
concern
for
you
you
are
unworthy
of
lady
esteem
of
the
titles
you
bear
or
the
honour
of
knighthood
when
the
lady
first
came
out
with
the
fatal
secret
and
mentioned
the
princess
name
douglas
strode
hastily
across
the
floor
of
the
pavilion
as
if
he
would
have
run
out
at
the
door
or
rather
fallen
against
it
but
the
motion
was
involuntary
he
stopped
short
and
again
turned
round
to
the
speaker
gazing
on
her
as
if
only
half
comprehending
what
she
said
the
truth
of
the
assertion
opened
to
him
by
degrees
and
it
may
well
be
supposed
the
intelligence
acted
upon
his
mind
and
frame
like
a
shock
of
electricity
he
would
fain
have
disbelieved
it
had
he
been
able
to
lay
hold
of
a
plausible
pretext
to
doubt
it
but
every
recollected
circumstance
coincided
in
the
establishment
of
the
unwelcome
fact
all
that
he
could
say
to
the
lady
as
he
stood
like
a
statue
gazing
her
in
the
face
was
who
art
thou
i
am
mary
kirkmichael
of
balmedie
said
she
and
i
came
with
the
princess
disguised
as
her
attendant
i
am
her
friend
and
confidant
and
we
held
communication
every
day
till
of
late
that
my
dear
mistress
discontinued
her
visits
o
captain
tell
me
if
it
is
in
your
power
to
save
her
douglas
flung
himself
on
a
form
in
the
corner
of
the
tent
and
hid
his
face
with
his
hand
and
at
the
same
time
groaned
as
if
every
throb
would
have
burst
his
heart
casement
he
had
seen
his
royal
his
affectionate
and
adored
mistress
swung
from
the
enemy
battlements
without
one
effort
to
save
her
and
without
a
tear
wetting
his
cheek
and
his
agony
of
mind
became
so
extreme
that
he
paid
no
more
regard
to
the
lady
who
was
still
standing
over
him
adding
the
bitterest
censure
to
lamentation
yet
he
told
her
not
of
her
mistress
melancholy
fate
he
could
not
tell
her
but
the
ejaculatory
words
that
he
uttered
from
time
to
time
too
plainly
informed
mary
kirkmichael
that
the
life
of
her
royal
mistress
was
either
in
jeopardy
or
irretrievably
lost
the
douglas
saw
the
lady
no
more
nor
regarded
her
he
rushed
from
the
tent
and
gave
such
orders
as
quite
confounded
his
warriors
one
part
being
quite
incompatible
with
another
and
in
the
confusion
mary
glided
quietly
away
from
the
scene
without
farther
notice
all
the
motions
of
douglas
for
two
days
subsequent
to
this
piece
of
information
were
like
those
of
a
drunken
man
he
was
enraged
without
cause
and
acted
without
consistency
but
the
only
point
towards
which
all
these
jarring
and
discordant
passions
constantly
turned
was
revenge
on
the
english
deadly
and
insatiable
revenge
when
he
looked
towards
the
ramparts
of
the
castle
his
dark
eye
would
change
its
colour
and
sink
deeper
under
his
brow
while
his
brown
cheeks
would
appear
as
if
furrowed
across
and
his
teeth
ground
and
jarred
against
one
another
his
counsels
however
were
not
at
this
time
of
a
nature
suited
to
accomplish
any
thing
material
against
his
rivals
he
meditated
the
most
deadly
retaliation
but
was
prevented
before
he
could
put
it
in
practice
on
the
following
evening
when
the
disturbance
of
his
mind
had
somewhat
subsided
and
appeared
to
be
settling
into
a
sullen
depression
of
spirit
or
rather
a
softened
melancholy
he
was
accosted
by
a
monk
who
had
craved
and
obtained
admittance
for
a
deference
to
all
that
these
people
said
or
did
was
a
leading
feature
of
that
age
douglas
scarcely
regarded
him
on
his
first
entrance
and
to
his
address
only
deigned
to
answer
by
a
slight
motion
of
his
head
for
the
monk
whole
appearance
augured
little
beyond
contempt
he
was
of
a
diminutive
stature
had
a
slight
starved
make
and
a
weak
treble
voice
his
conversation
nevertheless
proved
of
that
sort
that
soon
drew
the
attention
of
the
chief
may
the
blessed
virgin
the
mother
of
god
bless
and
shield
you
captain
humph
returned
the
douglas
noding
his
head
may
saint
withold
be
your
helmet
and
buckler
in
the
day
of
battle
amen
said
the
douglas
interrupting
him
and
taking
a
searching
look
of
the
tiny
being
that
spoke
as
if
there
were
something
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
that
struck
him
with
emotion
and
withhold
your
weapon
from
the
blood
of
the
good
added
the
monk
from
the
breast
of
the
professor
of
our
holy
religion
and
dispose
your
heart
to
peace
and
amity
that
the
land
may
have
rest
and
the
humble
servants
of
the
cross
protection
why
do
you
say
to
this
knight
is
your
profession
of
christianity
a
mere
form
and
are
the
blessed
tenets
which
it
enjoins
strangers
to
thy
turbulent
bosom
humph
said
douglas
with
reverence
be
it
spoken
monk
but
you
holy
brethren
have
got
a
way
of
chattering
about
things
that
you
do
not
understand
adhere
to
your
books
and
your
beads
i
am
a
soldier
and
must
stick
by
my
profession
bearing
arms
for
my
king
and
country
i
am
a
soldier
too
rejoined
the
monk
and
bear
arms
and
suffer
in
a
better
cause
but
enough
of
this
i
have
a
strange
message
for
you
captain
you
must
know
that
a
few
weeks
ago
a
beautiful
youth
came
to
our
monastery
seeking
supply
of
writing
materials
which
he
could
not
otherwise
procure
he
was
a
kind
and
ingenious
youth
i
supplied
him
for
i
loved
him
and
i
have
since
seen
him
sundry
times
in
my
cell
but
last
night
as
i
was
sitting
alone
a
little
before
midnight
i
am
afraid
you
will
not
believe
me
captain
for
the
matter
of
my
message
is
so
strange
i
had
gone
over
my
breviary
and
was
sitting
with
the
cross
pressed
to
my
lips
when
behold
the
youth
entered
i
arose
to
receive
him
but
he
beckoned
me
to
keep
away
from
his
person
and
glided
backward
i
then
recollected
that
he
must
be
a
spirit
else
he
could
not
have
got
in
and
though
i
do
not
recollect
all
that
he
said
the
purport
of
his
message
was
to
the
following
effect
said
he
and
go
to
the
captain
of
the
scottish
army
whom
you
will
find
in
great
perplexity
of
mind
and
meditating
schemes
of
cruelty
and
retaliation
which
would
be
disgraceful
to
himself
and
to
his
country
but
let
him
beware
for
there
be
some
at
his
hand
that
he
does
not
see
and
if
he
dare
in
the
slightest
instance
disobey
the
injunctions
which
you
shall
from
time
to
time
lay
on
him
his
sight
shall
be
withered
by
a
visitant
from
another
world
whose
face
he
shall
too
well
recognize
ever
again
to
find
rest
under
a
consciousness
of
her
presence
monk
benjamin
i
was
not
what
i
seemed
a
few
days
ago
i
was
a
lady
in
the
prime
of
youth
and
hope
i
loved
that
captain
and
was
betrothed
to
him
for
his
sake
i
ventured
my
life
and
lost
it
without
a
single
effort
on
his
part
to
save
me
but
his
fate
is
in
my
hand
and
i
will
use
the
power
it
is
given
to
me
to
control
or
further
his
efforts
as
i
see
meet
to
turn
his
sword
in
the
day
of
battle
or
to
redouble
the
strength
of
his
and
his
warriors
arms
my
behests
shall
be
made
known
to
him
and
if
he
would
avoid
distraction
of
mind
as
well
as
utter
ruin
let
him
tremble
to
disobey
in
the
first
place
then
you
will
find
him
pondering
on
a
scheme
for
the
recovery
of
my
lifeless
body
a
scheme
of
madness
which
can
not
and
may
not
succeed
therefore
charge
him
from
me
to
desist
you
will
find
him
farther
preparing
an
embassy
to
my
father
and
mother
to
inform
them
of
the
circumstances
of
my
death
and
that
not
in
the
words
of
truth
but
let
him
take
care
to
keep
that
a
secret
as
he
would
take
care
of
his
life
and
honour
for
on
that
depends
his
ultimate
success
tell
him
farther
from
me
to
revenge
my
death
but
not
on
the
helpless
beings
that
are
already
in
his
power
to
pursue
with
steady
aim
his
primary
object
and
his
reward
shall
be
greater
than
he
can
conceive
strange
as
this
story
may
appear
captain
it
is
strictly
according
to
truth
you
yourself
may
judge
whether
it
was
a
true
or
lying
spirit
that
spoke
to
me
are
you
not
some
demon
or
spirit
yourself
said
the
douglas
who
know
such
things
as
these
tell
me
are
you
a
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
that
you
can
thus
tell
me
the
thoughts
and
purposes
of
my
heart
i
am
a
being
such
as
yourself
said
the
monk
a
poor
brother
of
the
cistertian
order
and
of
the
cloister
adjoining
to
this
and
i
only
speak
what
i
was
enjoined
to
speak
without
knowing
whether
it
is
true
or
false
i
was
threatened
with
trouble
and
dismay
if
i
declined
the
commission
and
i
advise
you
captain
for
your
own
peace
of
mind
to
attend
to
this
warning
douglas
promised
that
he
would
at
least
for
a
time
and
the
monk
taking
his
leave
left
the
earl
in
the
utmost
consternation
the
tale
was
so
simple
and
unmasked
there
was
no
doubting
the
truth
of
it
for
without
such
a
communication
it
was
impossible
he
could
have
known
the
things
he
uttered
and
the
assurance
that
a
disembodied
being
should
have
such
a
power
over
him
though
it
somewhat
staggered
the
douglas
faith
created
an
unwonted
sensation
within
his
breast
a
sensation
of
wonder
and
awe
for
none
of
that
age
were
exempt
from
the
sway
of
an
overpowering
superstition
chapter
x
what
a
brave
group
we
have
that
fellow
there
he
with
the
cushion
would
outprate
the
cricket
the
babble
of
the
brook
is
not
more
constant
or
syllabled
with
such
monotony
than
the
eternal
tingle
of
his
tongue
i
bid
him
silence
master
or
do
him
so
which
likes
you
we
must
now
leave
the
two
commanders
in
plights
more
dismal
than
ever
commanders
were
before
and
return
to
our
warden
the
bold
baron
of
mountcomyn
whose
feats
form
a
more
pleasant
and
diverting
subject
his
warfare
all
this
while
was
of
a
predatory
nature
for
that
his
warriors
were
peculiarly
fitted
and
at
this
time
they
did
not
fail
to
avail
themselves
well
of
the
troubles
on
the
border
and
the
prevailing
power
of
the
scots
alongst
its
line
the
warden
pretended
still
to
be
acting
in
concert
with
douglas
but
his
operations
were
all
according
to
the
purposes
of
his
own
heart
he
cared
nothing
for
the
success
or
the
aggrandisement
of
douglas
but
he
had
a
particular
eye
to
the
advancement
of
his
own
house
and
the
honour
of
his
kinsmen
it
was
therefore
a
matter
of
daily
consultation
with
him
and
his
friends
how
they
should
act
in
conformity
with
this
ruling
principle
the
probability
was
against
douglas
that
he
would
ultimately
fail
in
his
undertaking
and
be
stripped
of
all
his
dominions
viewing
the
matter
in
that
light
it
was
high
time
for
the
redhough
to
be
providing
for
himself
on
the
other
hand
should
douglas
succeed
in
his
enterprize
and
become
the
king
there
was
no
other
way
by
which
the
warden
could
hold
his
own
save
by
a
certain
species
of
subordination
a
submission
in
effect
though
not
by
acknowledgment
such
matters
were
perfectly
understood
by
the
chiefs
in
these
times
and
all
who
proved
refractory
were
taught
in
silence
to
feel
the
grounds
on
which
they
stood
this
was
therefore
a
most
critical
period
for
sir
ringan
the
future
advancement
of
his
house
depended
on
every
turn
of
his
hand
during
all
the
former
part
of
the
siege
he
had
conducted
himself
with
an
eye
to
douglas
failure
to
which
he
was
partly
incited
by
the
prophecies
of
thomas
the
rhymer
and
those
of
his
kinsman
master
michael
scott
of
oakwood
whom
he
believed
the
most
powerful
wizard
and
the
greatest
prophet
that
ever
had
arisen
since
the
rhymer
days
but
on
the
return
of
charlie
of
yardbire
and
dan
chisholm
from
the
beleaguering
army
the
warden
got
the
extraordinary
intelligence
that
the
lady
jane
howard
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
douglas
as
well
as
musgrave
only
brother
these
things
changed
sir
ringan
prospects
of
the
future
in
a
very
material
degree
and
he
pondered
on
changing
his
mode
of
operations
before
doing
so
however
he
called
a
council
of
his
kinsmen
and
brought
the
matter
again
before
them
most
of
them
counselled
the
continuance
of
the
predatory
warfare
in
which
they
had
been
engaged
it
had
served
to
enrich
them
and
had
proved
as
they
reasoned
of
more
service
to
the
douglas
than
if
they
had
joined
his
host
that
it
proved
of
more
service
to
himself
and
his
kinsmen
than
if
they
had
joined
the
host
the
warden
was
well
aware
but
he
was
not
satisfied
that
the
douglas
viewed
their
mountain
warfare
as
of
great
consequence
to
him
and
he
farther
knew
that
services
were
always
repaid
not
according
to
the
toil
and
exertion
undergone
but
according
as
they
were
estimated
while
that
estimation
was
ever
and
anon
modelled
by
the
apparent
motives
of
the
performer
after
much
slow
and
inanimate
reasoning
on
the
matter
sir
ringan
chanced
after
a
minute
deep
thought
to
say
what
would
i
not
give
to
know
the
events
that
are
to
happen
at
roxburgh
between
this
time
and
the
end
of
the
christmas
holidays
auld
michael
scott
will
ken
brawly
said
charlie
of
yardbire
then
what
for
shoudna
we
ken
too
said
the
knight
aye
what
for
shoudna
we
ken
too
said
dickie
o

they
might
get
a
kittle
cast
that
meddled
wi
him
an
nae
the
wiser
after
a
said
robert
of
howpasley
when
he
was
at
pains
to
come
a
the
way
to
the
castle
of
mountcomyn
said
simon
longspeare
a
matter
o
five
scots
miles
ower
the
moor
to
warn
our
captain
the
warden
how
to
row
his
bowls
he
surely
winna
refuse
to
tell
him
what
to
be
the
final
issue
o
this
daft
contest
ane
wad
think
he
wadna
spare
a
cantrip
or
twa
said
sir
ringan
him
that
has
spirits
at
his
ca
an
canna
get

i
wark
it
wad
be
an
easy
matter
for
him
an

thicker
than

ay
that
a
true
tale
said
dickie
o
dryhope
it
wad
be
an
easy
matter
for
him
we
a
ken
that
an
blood
aye
thicker
than
water
if
i
were
to
gang
wi
a
gallant
retinue
said
sir
ringan
he
surely
wadna
refuse
to
gie
me
some
answer
he
wad
refuse
the
king
o
france
said
robert
of
howpasley
if
he
warna
i
the
key
for
human
conversation
an
maybe
gar
his
familiar
spirits
carry
you
away
and
thraw
ye
into
the
sea
or
set
you
down
some
faraway
land
for
a
piece
o
employment
to
them
and
amusement
to
himsel
he
has
served
mony
ane
that
gate
afore
now
od
i
defy
him
said
muckle
charlie
of
yardbire
if
my
master
the
warden
likes
to
tak
me
wi
him
for
his
elbowman
i
answer
for
him
against
a
the
monkey
spirits
that
auld
michael
has
spoke
like
yourself
honest
charlie
said
the
baron
and
if
it
is
judged
meet
by
my
friends
that
i
should
go
you
shall
be
one
that
shall
attend
me
certes
it
would
be
of
incalculable
benefit
to
me
for
all
your
sakes
to
know
even
by
a
small
hint
what
is
to
be
the
upshot
of
this
business
but
should
i
be
taken
away
or
detained
ay
should
he
be
taken
away
or
detained
gentlemen
think
of
that
gentlemen
said
dickie
o
dryhope
i
approve
highly
of
the
mission
said
simon
longspeare
for
i
believe
there
is
nothing
too
hard
for
that
old
wizard
to
do
and
no
event
so
closely
sealed
up
in
futurity
but
that
he
can
calculate
with
a
good
deal
of
certainty
on
the
issue
i
see
that
our
all
depends
on
our
knowledge
of
the
event
but
i
disapprove
of
our
chief
attending
on
the
wizard
in
person
for
in
his
absence
who
is
to
be
our
commander
and
should
any
sudden
rising
of
our
foes
take
place
of
which
we
are
every
hour
uncertain
we
may
lose
more
by
the
want
of
him
one
hour
than
we
could
ever
regain
ay
think
of
that
gentlemen
said
dickie
my
cousin
longspeare
speaks
good
sense
what
could
we
do
wanting
sir
ringan
we
all
children
to
him
and
little
better
without
him
and
old
children
are
the
worst
of
all
children
said
the
warden
i
would
rather
be
deaved
with
the
teething
yammer
than
the
toothless
chatter
prithee
peace
and
let
us
hear
out
our
cousin
proposal
the
circle
of
the
gallant
kinsmen
did
not
like
ill
to
hear
this
snub
on
old
dickie
they
could
not
account
for
the
chief
partiality
to
him
and
they
were
even
afraid
that
being
the
oldest
man
he
should
be
nominated
to
the
command
in
the
knight
absence
it
was
however
noted
by
all
that
dickie
was
not
half
so
great
a
man
in
field
or
foray
as
he
was
at
board
in
the
castle
of
mountcomyn
only
a
very
few
men
of
experience
discerned
the
bottom
of
this
the
truth
was
that
sir
ringan
did
not
care
a
doit
either
for
dickie
counsels
or
his
arm
but
he
saw
that
his
lady
abhorred
him
and
therefore
he
would
not
yield
to
cast
him
off
his
lady
was
of
a
high
spirit
and
proud
unyielding
temper
and
the
knight
could
not
stand
his
own
with
her
at
all
times
and
seasons
but
before
his
kinsmen
warriors
he
was
particularly
jealous
of
his
dignity
and
would
not
yield
to
the
encroachment
on
it
of
a
single
item
it
was
by
this
kind
of
elemental
opposition
if
it
may
be
so
termed
that
dickie
maintained
his
consequence
at
the
warden
castle
in
the
field
he
was
nothing
more
than
a
foolish
vain
old
kinsman
i
propose
said
longspeare
that
we
send
a
deputation
of
our
to
the
warlock
of
whom
we
have
some
of
the
first
that
perhaps
ever
the
world
produced
as
a
bard
or
minstrel
we
can
send
colley
carol
a
man
that
is
fit
to
charm
the
spirits
out
of
the
heart
of
the
earth
or
the
bowels
of
the
cloud
without
the
aid
of
old
michael
as
a
man
of
crabbed
wit
and
endless
absurdity
we
can
send
the
deil
tam
as
a
true
natural
and
moral
philosopher
the
laird
o
the
peatstacknowe
as
one
versed
in
all
the
mysteries
of
religion
and
many
mysteries
beside
or
some
tell
lies
we
can
send
the
gospel
friar
all
these
are
men
of
spirit
and
can
handle
the
sword
and
the
bow
either
less
or
more
and
as
a
man
of
unequalled
strength
and
courage
and
a
guard
and
captain
over
all
the
rest
we
can
send
charlie
o
yardbire
and
i
will
defy
all
the
kingdoms
of
europe
to
send
out
sic
another
quorum
either
to
emperor
turk
wizard
or
the
devil
himself
every
one
applauded
simon
longspeare
motion
and
declared
the
deputation
worthy
of
being
sent
out
if
it
were
for
nothing
but
its
own
unrivalled
excellence
never
they
said
since
the
mind
of
man
was
framed
was
there
such
a
combination
of
rare
talent
in
so
small
a
circle
there
was
none
of
those
nominated
for
the
mission
present
excepting
muckle
charlie
scott
charlie
scratched
his
head
and
said
gude
faith
callans
i
hae
a
queer
bike
to
gang
wi
i
fear
we
get
mae
to
laugh
at
us
than
gie
us
ought
the
tam
an
the
metre
poet
the
fat
gospel
friar
and
the
laird
o
the
peatstacknowe
i
never
gaed
out
on
sic
a
foray
as
this
afore
an
little
do
i
wot
how
we
come
on
a
wheen
queer
chaps
faith
the
jocund
kinsmen
then
shouted
to
gibby
jordan
of
the
peatstacknowe
to
come
into
the
circle
that
they
might
hear
what
he
had
to
say
about
going
on
this
celebrated
embassy
this
gentleman
name
had
erst
been
gordon
by
some
mistake
either
in
spelling
or
falling
into
some
foul
tub
by
night
for
some
grounded
it
both
ways
it
had
been
changed
on
him
to
jordan
and
as
he
had
no
resource
he
was
obliged
to
admit
it
as
legitimate
he
was
a
man
of
education
and
could
read
write
and
cast
up
accounts
but
his
figure
features
and
the
nasal
twine
with
which
he
pronounced
every
word
that
he
spoke
rendered
his
discourse
irresistibly
ludicrous
every
one
was
so
ready
to
give
jordan
the
information
that
he
was
chosen
as
one
to
go
on
a
deputation
to
master
michael
scott
the
warlock
that
the
laird
for
a
long
time
could
not
get
a
word
said
but
stood
and
looked
about
him
turning
always
round
his
long
nose
to
the
speaker
that
was
loudest
or
him
that
was
poking
him
most
forcibly
to
obtain
attention
gentlemen
said
gibby
jordan
you
mind
me
of
a
story
that
i
have
heard
about
a
paddock
that
was
lying
on
the
plowed
land
an
by
comes
the
harrows
an
they
gangs
out
ower
the
tap
o
the
poor
paddock
every
tooth
gae
her
a
tite
an
a
turn
ower
the
matter
wi
you
the
day
mrs
paddock
says
the
goodman
ava
but
rather
ower
mony
masters
this
morning
quo
the
paddock
wish
i
were
safe
i
my
hole
again
an
let
them
ring
on
sae
master
i
tak
the
hint
an
wish
ye
a
a
good
morning
there
was
no
such
escape
for
the
honest
laird
they
surrounded
him
and
insisted
on
hearing
his
sentiments
at
full
length
teasing
him
till
he
began
to
lose
his
temper
a
thing
in
which
they
delighted
for
the
more
mischief
the
better
sport
for
these
wild
border
but
muckle
charlie
perceiving
this
came
up
to
his
side
callants
appointit
gibby
guard
said
he
an
his
guard
i
be
what
the
deil
has
ony
o
you
to
say
to
him
only
to
hear
what
he
thinks
o
the
journey
was
repeated
on
all
sides
gentlemen
said
gibby
the
hale
affair
brings
me
of
a
story
that
i
hae
heard
about
a
wife
that
had
a
batch
o
chickens
but
then
ye
maun
mind
gentlemen
she
had
a
very
great
deal
o
chickens
i
daresay
nae
fewer
than
a
hunner
for
she
had
sax
great
cleckings
an
she
was
unco
feared
that
the
gled
wad
tak
them
away
sae
she
wales
out
a
wheen
o
the
fattest
an
the
best
an
she
sends
them
out
to
the
cock
that
he
might
herd
an
tak
care
o
them
cock
will
fleg
away
the
gleds
quo
she
gar
them
keep
their
distance
an
i
get
my
braw
birds
a
saved
but
by
comes
the
greedy
gled
an
when
the
cock
saw
him
he
croups
an
he
currs
an
blithe
to
keep
his
ain
skin
hale
he
staps
his
head
in
a
hole
an
the
gled
carried
off
the
hale
o
his
bit
charge
weel
the
gled
he
fand
them
sae
fat
an
sae
gusty
that
he
never
linned
till
he
had
taen
away
every
chicken
that
the
wife
had
where
is
the
moral
of
that
story
laird
cried
they
we
see
no
coincidence
because
ye
blind
said
jordan
dinna
ye
see
that
michael
the
cock
the
deil
the
gled
an
ye
the
birds
he
get
us
first
he
find
out
that
we
sic
a
wheen
rare
chaps
that
he
never
till
he
hae
ye
ilk
ane
an
that
will
be
the
end
o
your
daft
embassy
all
the
rest
of
the
nominated
members
being
sent
for
expressly
from
their
different
posts
they
soon
arrived
but
they
seemed
every
one
to
be
averse
to
the
mission
except
colley
the
minstrel
who
was
elevated
with
the
idea
of
being
introduced
to
the
celebrated
master
anticipating
something
highly
romantic
and
precisely
in
his
own
way
as
for
thomas
craik
better
known
by
the
singular
appellation
of
the
deil
tam
he
cared
not
much
about
any
thing
provided
he
got
plenty
of
drink
mischief
and
breaking
of
heads
they
got
all
that
day
to
prepare
themselves
while
sir
ringan
and
his
friends
were
considering
what
they
should
send
as
a
present
to
the
illustrious
necromancer
they
weened
he
despised
riches
believing
that
he
could
turn
small
slates
to
gold
by
touching
them
and
after
much
consultation
it
was
resolved
to
send
him
a
captive
maiden
and
boy
as
they
had
two
in
the
camp
of
exquisite
loveliness
the
maid
was
the
reputed
daughter
of
sir
anthony
hall
an
inveterate
enemy
to
the
baron
of
mountcomyn
who
had
burned
his
castles
and
plundered
his
lands
but
the
warden
at
length
engaging
with
him
hand
to
hand
at
the
battle
of
blaikhope
slew
him
and
having
discomfited
his
army
he
plundered
and
harried
all
that
pertained
to
him
at
which
time
he
took
this
beautiful
maiden
prisoner
whom
he
treated
kindly
and
kept
as
an
handmaiden
her
name
was
delany
and
so
lovely
was
she
become
in
person
and
so
amiable
in
her
manners
that
several
of
the
knight
kinsmen
had
asked
her
in
marriage
these
applications
he
had
uniformly
put
off
on
pretence
of
his
friends
degrading
themselves
by
marrying
a
captive
englishwoman
a
term
that
never
sounded
in
a
scot
ear
but
with
disgust
but
in
fact
the
warden
did
not
choose
that
any
of
them
should
be
so
closely
connected
with
an
old
respectable
northumberland
family
the
boy
was
called
elias
and
was
the
property
of
jock
o
gilmanscleuch
having
been
taken
by
him
in
a
night
foray
at
rothbury
when
the
warden
applied
to
jock
for
him
bidding
him
name
his
ransom
he
answered
that
if
he
wist
michael
wad
either
mak
a
warlock
o
him
or
tak
out
his
harigalds
to
be
a
sacrifice
to
the
deil
he
wadna
gie
him
up
for
a
the
lands
o
newburgh
an
birkendely
being
pacified
on
these
points
as
well
as
matters
would
bear
the
two
captives
were
dressed
in
elegant
robes
and
delivered
to
the
embassy
charlie
was
deputed
their
captain
and
leader
the
rest
were
all
to
be
equals
on
the
same
footing
and
to
choose
their
own
speakers
after
getting
every
direction
regarding
the
purport
of
their
mission
the
caution
and
respect
which
they
were
to
use
toward
the
master
and
the
questions
they
were
to
get
answered
they
departed
every
one
well
mounted
on
an
english
horse
the
friar
on
his
own
substantial
mule
and
such
provision
with
them
as
they
judged
necessary
carol
the
bard
had
a
lyre
and
a
flute
gibby
jordan
ycleped
of
the
peatstacknowe
had
nothing
beside
a
rusty
sword
the
friar
had
an
immense
wallet
below
him
judged
to
be
all
implements
of
enchantment
the
others
had
deer
or
goatskin
wallets
stuffed
with
such
things
as
they
deemed
necessary
and
all
of
them
wore
arms
in
case
of
meeting
with
any
unknown
interruption
several
of
the
gallant
kinsmen
shed
tears
on
taking
leave
of
delany
who
contrary
to
what
they
all
expected
seemed
full
of
gaiety
and
rather
fond
of
the
change
than
disheartened
at
it
well
away
they
rode
and
as
soon
as
they
were
fairly
out
of
sight
of
the
army
every
one
began
to
attach
himself
to
delany
more
closely
than
his
neighbour
the
friar
talked
to
her
of
penances
and
the
sins
of
youth
and
the
unlimited
confidence
due
to
the
professors
of
religion
the
bard
chanted
his
wildest
and
most
amorous
ditties
tam
punned
and
quibbled
on
the
words
of
the
rest
and
gibby
continued
to
narrate
his
parables
sometimes
to
one
sometimes
to
another
as
he
found
them
disposed
to
listen
and
sometimes
to
none
at
all
as
for
charlie
he
contented
himself
with
laughing
at
them
all
alternately
and
occasionally
exchanging
a
word
or
sentiment
with
a
valued
friend
of
his
corby

till
i
tell
you
a
queer
joke
that
come
into
my
mind
by
your
speaking
about
armour
ahint
last
year
when
the
dalesmen
were
cried
out
in
sic
a
hurry
for
the
durham
raide
there
was
ane
o
fairniehirst
troopers
got
strong
breastplates
steel
made
to
defend
his
heart
there
was
ane
brogg
paterson
in
hawick
a
wag
that
i
kenned
weel
was
employed
to
fit
the
harnessing
to
the
clothes
and
learning
that
the
raide
was
to
be
early
in
the
morning
nae
leisure
for
shifting
an
seeing
the
trooper
so
intent
on
protecting
his
heart
instead
o
putting
the
steel
plates
in
the
inside
o
his
doublet
paterson
fastened
them
in
the
seat
of
his
trews
after
passing
the
tine
the
scots
encamped
within
a
half
moon
of
an
impervious
brake
and
sent
out
a
party
of
foragers
among
whom
was
this
trooper
turnbull
the
party
were
pursued
by
a
body
of
english
horse
and
several
of
them
slain
but
turnbull
reaching
the
brake
plunged
into
it
horse
and
man
the
horse
stuck
fast
and
just
as
poor
turnbull
was
trying
to
extricate
himself
by
scrambling
over
the
horse
head
an
englishman
came
riding
fiercely
up
and
struck
him
such
a
blow
with
his
lance
behind
as
would
have
spitted
him
to
the
neck
but
hitting
right
on
the
steel
plate
he
made
him
fly
over
the
brake
and
into
a
place
of
safety
a
comrade
perceiving
came
to
assist
him
and
found
turnbull
lying
on
the
ground
repeating
to
himself
these
words
with
the
utmost
devotion
god
bless
brogg
paterson
in
hawick
god
bless
brogg
paterson
in
hawick
wherefore
that
said
the
other
because
said
turnbull
he
kend
better
where
my
heart
lay
than
i
did
charlie
laughed
so
heartily
at
this
jocular
tale
that
he
did
not
expose
gibby
jordan
of
the
peatstacknowe
to
his
associates
at
that
time
but
keeping
behind
with
him
he
held
him
in
conversation
though
he
saw
that
his
teeth
were
watering
to
be
near
the
fair
delany
they
came
that
night
to
a
place
called
trows
on
the
english
side
of
the
border
but
adjoining
to
the
very
ridge
of
the
fells
the
name
of
the
hind
who
sojourned
there
was
jock
robson
he
had
a
good
stock
both
of
cows
and
sheep
being
so
thoroughly
a
neutral
man
that
both
sides
spared
him
and
both
sides
trusted
him
he
gave
a
night
grass
to
the
driven
cattle
and
sheep
from
each
side
and
a
night
lodging
to
the
drivers
and
for
this
he
exacted
kane
sheep
or
a
small
cow
which
none
ever
grudged
him
because
they
found
themselves
so
much
at
home
in
his
house
he
would
assist
either
party
in
catching
a
prey
and
either
party
in
recovering
it
again
taking
rewards
from
both
and
though
both
the
english
and
the
scots
knew
of
this
they
never
trusted
him
the
less
for
they
knew
that
what
he
undertook
he
would
fulfil
but
no
farther
out
of
your
sight
out
of
your
pay
and
out
of
your
service
with
jock
robson
at
this
yeoman
habitation
our
notable

arrived
at
a
late
hour
for
though
scarcely
five
afternoon
it
was

dark
they
called
at
the

and
out

a

so
he
turned
hastily
about
and
the
friar
that
moment
clapping
the
spurs
to
his
mule
gallopped
round
the
corner
leaving
the
rest
to
make
good
their
quarters
in
the
best
way
they
could
the
mention
of
the

charlie
scott
and
in
the
name

cried
the
friar
returning
to
the
charge
on
hearing
charlie
voice
and
in
my
name
cried
tam
craik
an
gibby
jordan
o
the
peatstacknowe

here

a
brave
yeoman
look
if
this
be
nae
marion
hersel
and
with
that
he
led
delany
palfrey
up
to
the
light
robson
lifted
his
eyes
and
saw
her
and
was
so
much
struck
with
her
dazzling
beauty
that
he
had
not
power
to
address
even
his
beloved
friend
charlie
scott
far
less
any
other
of
his
guests
but
lifting
the
maiden
down
in
his
arms
he
led
her
in
to
his
dame
and
said
to
one
of
his
lads
rin
out
wi
a
light
callant
an
help
the
troopers
to
put
up
their
horses
the
horses
were
soon
put
up
for
every
one
seemed
more
anxious
than
another
to
get
first
in
to
the
cheek
of
jock
robson
ingle
and
have
his
seat
placed
next
to
that
of
delany
but
the
poet
being
the
most
agile
and
not
the
least
amorous
of
the
group
effected
this
greatly
to
his
satisfaction
chapter
xi
the
youngest
turned
him
in
a
path
and
drew
a
buirdly
brande
and
fifteen
of
the
foremost
slewe
till
back
the
lave
couthe
stande
then
he
spurred
the
grey
unto
the
path
till
baith
her
sides
they
bledde
now
grey
if
thou
carry
nae
me
away
my
life
it
lies
in
wedde
of
auld
we
must
pass
over
a
great
part
of
the
conversation
that
evening
in
order
to
get
forward
to
the
more
momentous
part
of
the
history
of
our
embassy
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
poet
was
in
high
glory
and
not
only
delivered
himself
in
pure
iambics
but
sung
several
love
ditties
and
one
song
of
a
foray
that
pleased
charlie
scott
mightily
but
isaac
the
curate
has
only
given
a
fragment
of
it
which
runs
thus
if
you
will
meet
me
on
the
dirdam
waste
merry
man
mint
to
follow
i
start
you
the
deer
and
lead
you
the
chace
with
a
whoop
and
a
whoo
and
a
hollo
the
deer
that
you
see
has
horns
enow
marked
wi
red
and
merled
wi
blue
and
that
deer
he
will
not
turn
his
tail
for
the
stoutest
hinds
that
range
the
dale
come
then
driver
in
gear
bedight
come
bold
yeoman
and
squire
and
knight
the
wind
soughs
loud
on
craig
and
heuch
and
the
linn
rowts
loud
in
the
crookside
cleuch
nor
tramp
of
steed
nor
jingle
of
spear
will
ever
be
heard
by
the
southern
deer
the
streamer
is
out
and
the
moon
away
and
the
morning
starn
will
rise
or
day
then
mount
to
the
stirrup
and
scour
the
fell
merry
man
mint
to
follow
and
over
the
muir
and
the
dean
and
the
dell
with
a
whoop
and
a
whoo
and
a
hollo
thy
words
and
thy
song
young
man
said
the
friar
are
like
sounding
brass
and
a
tinkling
cymbal
if
laid
in
the
balance
they
are
lighter
than
vanity
yours
will
not
prove
so
said
the
poet
provided
you
are
laid
in
with
them
for
as
the
old
song
says
wit
is
but
weak
father
his
gifts
they
are
but
sma
but
the
bouk
that
under
his
breast
bane
it
grieves
me
warst
of
a
if
thou
singest
this
nonsense
of
me
said
the
friar
lo
i
will
smite
thee
upon
the
mouth
yea
upon
the
will
i
smite
thee
till
thine
eyes
shall
gush
out
like
two
fountains
of
waters
and
so
saying
he
began
to
look
about
him
for
some
missile
weapon
to
throw
at
the
bard
face
his
breast
burning
with
indignation
for
he
loved
not
the
tenor
of
the
poet
conversation
to
the
maid
tam
and
jordan
encouraged
the
friar
to
make
the
assault
in
hopes
that
the
poet
might
be
dislodged
or
affronted
but
yardbire
restrained
the
warmth
of
the
friar
not
being
aware
of
his
real
sentiments
and
ordered
peace
and
good
fellowship
dame
robson
covered
the
hearth
with
a
huge
fire
and
her
husband
bringing
in
a
leg
of
beef
set
it
upon
the
table
and
bade
every
one
help
himself
the
words
of
thy
mouth
are
exceeding
good
and
sweet
unto
the
ear
said
the
friar
as
doubtless
thy
food
is
to
the
taste
with
that
he
rose
and
helped
himself
to
three
nice
and
extensive
slices
of
raw
beef
and
these
he
roasted
on
the
tongs
which
he
had
just
lifted
to
smite
the
poet
on
the
head
in
good
truth
though
every
one
cooked
his
own
supper
as
was
the
fashion
of
that
iron
time
there
was
none
did
it
half
so
nicely
as
the
friar
nor
so
bunglingly
as
jordan
whose
supper
though
long
behind
the
others
in
being
ready
was
so
unshapely
a
piece
and
so
raw
on
the
one
side
that
the
friar
observed
it
was
like
ephraim
of
old
as
a
cake
unturned
some
roasted
their
meat
on
old
swords
some
on
spindles
for
their
hosts
took
no
heed
how
they
were
fitted
or
in
what
manner
they
shifted
in
these
respects
seemingly
satisfied
that
they
had
plenty
for
the
cooking
and
leaving
them
to
cook
it
or
eat
it
raw
as
they
chose
the
poet
made
haste
and
first
of
all
cooked
two
or
three
nice
slices
for
the
maiden
giving
her
what
she
would
take
before
he
would
taste
a
morsel
himself
some
commended
him
for
this
and
others
jeered
him
but
the
friar
in
his
grave
moral
style
said
the
severest
things
of
all
from
the
very
commencement
of
the
journey
a
jealousy
or
misunderstanding
began
to
subsist
between
these
two
which
never
again
subsided
till
they
came
to
blows
the
poet
answered
him
again
with
a
song
keep
ye
to
your
books
and
your
beads
goodman
your
ave
marias
and
creeds
goodman
for
gin
ye
end
as
ye
begun
there
will
be
some
crack
of
your
deeds
goodman
at
length
the
party
retired
to
rest
all
save
jordan
and
their
worthy
host
the
latter
never
slept
in
the
night
he
had
always
some
watching
walking
or
work
in
hand
that
suited
that
season
best
and
as
for
gibby
he
determined
to
sit
up
all
night
to
watch
that
the
poet
made
no
encroachments
on
the
place
of
delany
repose
robson
encouraged
his
purpose
joined
him
heartily
in
conversation
listened
to
his
stories
with
apparent
delight
and
when
all
the
rest
were
asleep
wormed
the
whole
business
of
the
embassy
out
of
the
shallow
laird
who
unfortunately
testified
his
fears
that
they
were
carrying
the
lovely
maiden
and
boy
to
the
old
warlock
to
be
a
sacrifice
to
the
devil
robson
appeared
terribly
confounded
at
this
peace
of
intelligence
for
from
the
time
that
he
heard
it
he
conversed
no
more
with
jordan
about
one
in
the
morning
he
began
to
put
on
his
as
if
preparing
for
a
journey
where
are
ye
going
at
this
time
of
night
enquired
the
laird
i
maun
gang
out
an
see
how
the
night
wears
said
robson
i
hae
sax
score
o
scots
queys
that

if
i
let
the
king
ellwand
ower
the
hill
i
hae
them
to
seek
frae
the
kips
o
kale
gibby
accompanied
him
to
the
door
hoping
the
king
ellwand
would
not
be
over
the
hill
for
he
had
no
good
will
to
part
with
his
companion
but
as
soon
as
robson
turned
his
eye
to
the
sky
ha
gude
faith
i
maun
post
away
said
he
yonder
the
king
ellwand
already
begun
to
bore
the
hill

o

goud
knobs

o

gude
morrow
laird
i
ower
lang
here
gibby
returned
in
to
the
blazing
fire
and
hearing
so
many
persons
all
snoring
in
sleep
he
caught
the
infection
stretched
himself
upon
a
divot
seat
and
joined
the
chorus
with
as
much
zeal
as
any
of
them
morning
came
and
our
embassy
made
ready
for
proceeding
on
their
journey
but
robson
still
was
wanting
at
which
both
his
dame
and
household
lads
seemed
to
wonder
otherwise
the
rest
would
have
taken
no
notice
of
it
gibby
told
her
about
the
queys
that
were
outlyers
but
she
only
answered
him
with
a
hem
and
a
slight
shake
of
the
head
charlie
who
knew
his
man
well
began
to
smell
a
rat
and
calling
gibby
to
the
door
he
inquired
if
he
had
hinted
ought
of
their
business
to
their
host
the
laird
at
first
denied
but
charlie
questioned
him
till
he
confessed
the
whole
at
which
charlie
was
exceedingly
angry
and
hearing
that
he
had
informed
him
all
about
the
maiden
and
of
what
family
she
was
sprung
he
called
gibby
a
worthless
inconsiderate
being
and
said
he
had
ruined
their
expedition
for
that
he
knew
robson
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
the
halls
who
were
broken
men
and
many
of
them
skulking
about
the
border
that
delany
had
uncles
cousins
and
a
brother
living
if
she
was
the
man
daughter
she
was
supposed
to
be
and
that
these
would
without
fail
waylay
them
and
kill
them
every
man
for
the
sake
of
rescuing
her
robson
said
he
is
altogether
selfish
and
has
some
end
to
serve
perhaps
to
get
the
maid
into
his
own
hands
for
he
seemed
mightily
taken
with
her
beauty
and
i
calculate
widely
amiss
if
we
are
not
watched
from
this
house
and
whether
we
return
or
proceed
we
shall
be
attacked
in
the
first
strait
or
lonely
place
that
we
come
at
jordan
looked
exceedingly
out
of
countenance
and
every
feature
of
his
face
altered
what
had
i
ado
to
tell
the
rascal
exclaimed
he
or
wha
wad
hae
thought
o
him
playing
us
sic
a
trick
dog
that
he
is
it
wad
be
weel
done
to
let
his
liver
pree
the
taste
o
steel
charlie
made
him
promise
that
he
would
not
mention
the
circumstance
to
one
of
the
party
as
it
was
only
a
surmise
and
might
impede
their
progress
to
no
purpose
and
forthwith
they
mounted
armed
with
such
armour
as
they
had
and
all
save
gibby
jordan
as
cheerful
and
as
jealous
of
one
another
as
they
were
on
the
preceding
day
that
worthy
kept
close
by
the
side
of
muckle
charlie
and
looked
so
sharp
about
him
that
he
perceived
every
shepherd
traveller
and
cairn
that
appeared
on
the
border
fells
always
testifying
his
alarm
to
his
friend
that
perhaps
yon
was
one
of
the
halls
watching
charlie
had
resolved
to
go
by
jedburgh
straight
for
oakwood
castle
but
his
suspicions
of
robson
made
him
resolve
to
hold
more
to
the
eastward
in
order
to
keep
the
open
road
he
knew
that
if
they
were
watching
him
it
would
be
at
the
fords
of
kale
or
oxnam
on
the
jedburgh
road
and
by
taking
the
east
path
he
would
not
only
elude
them
but
in
case
of
a
pursuit
be
near
the
outposts
of
the
scottish
army
for
a
good
way
they
saw
nothing
and
began
to
think
themselves
in
safety
but
in
coming
down
a
little
from
the
point
of
the
debated
land
three
horsemen
appeared
to
the
westward
of
them
his
presence
be
about
us
said
gibby
yonder
the
halls
now
charlie
said
nothing
but
kept
watch
one
of
the
yeomen
vanished
in
a
twinkling
at
full
speed
the
other
two
came
at
a
brisk
canter
to
our
notable
embassy
what
do
they
mean
said
jordan
do
these
two
fellows
propose
to
conquer
us
all
it
wad
appear
that
they
do
said
charlie
for
they
come
on
us
without
halt
or
hesitation
i
hardly
think
they
succeed
added
gibby
although
they
twa
dangerous
looking
chaps
for
godsake
yardbire
tak
care
o
their
back
strokes
if
they
bring
you
down
our
chance
will
be
the
waur
charlie
then
called
to
the
rest
of
his
cavalcade
friends
here
are
some
strangers
come
to
join
us
tell
them
nothing
either
good
or
bad
but
keep
on
at
a
round
trot
see
we
are
not
far
from
the
towers
of
roxburgh
whatever
these
men
may
say
to
you
make
them
nothing
the
wiser
i
will
not
so
much
as
say
unto
them
whence
comest
thou
or
whither
art
thou
going
said
the
friar
i
sing
them
a
ditty
of
beauty
and
love
of
the
wing
of
the
raven
the
eye
of
the
dove
and
beings
all
purer
than
angels
above
said
the
poet
sic
a
rhame
o
nonsense
is
there
said
tam
craik
if
ony
o
the
dogs
say
an
impertinent
thing
to
me
i
gar
his
teeth
gang
down
his
throat
like
bristled
beans
it
was
not
long
before
the
two
joined
the
party
they
were
tall
athletic
men
armed
at
all
points
and
their
manner
had
a
dash
of
insulting
impertinence
in
it
a
good
morning
and
fair
grace
to
you
noble
and
worthy
gentlemen
said
the
foremost
may
we
presume
to
be
of
the
party
you
may
said
the
deil
tam
for
that
is
what
befits
you
if
you
are
willing
to
put
up
with
the
presumer
reward
you
are
witty
sir
i
suppose
said
the
trooper
and
pray
what
may
that
reward
be
yes
i
am
witty
said
tam
and
my
wit
is
sharp
when
it
is
not
in
its
sheath
do
you
understand
me
as
for
the
reward
of
presumption
it
is
in
scotland
to
be
crankit
before
and
kicked
behind
the
road
is
at
least
as
free
to
us
as
it
is
to
you
said
the
mosstrooper
and
of
that
we
intend
to
avail
ourselves
for
the
present
we
go
to
join
the
army
before
roxburgh
whither
are
you
bound
we
follow
our
noses
said
tam
but
they
guide
us
not
to
the
army
before
roxburgh
and
into
your
rearward
they
caution
us
not
to
enter
raw
hides
and
rank
bacon
keep
your
distance
while
tam
craik
and
the
trooper
were
thus
jangling
on
before
charlie
said
to
jordan
laird
what
do
think
o
yoursel
now
ye
hae
played
us
a
fine
pliskie
wi
your
ill
tackit
tongue
it
is
my
thought
that
ere
we
ride
a
mile
and
a
half
we
be
attacked
by
a
hale
troop
o
horse
that
chap
that
disna
speak
is
ane
o
the
wale
o
the
ha
i
ken
him
weel
for
a
his
half
visor
the
other
horseman
that
left
them
on
the
height
is
ower
to
the
fords
of
kale
and
if
i
guess
right
he
appear
at
yon
scroggy
bush
wi
sae
mony
at
his
back
that
we
wad
hardly
be
a
to
them
an
that
in
less
time
than
ane
wad
gang
a
mile
it
is
an
ill
business
this
said
gibby
it
brings
me
in
mind
o
mair
than
i
name
but
gudesake
yardbire
an
ye
be
sure
he
is
ane
the
halls
what
for
do
nae
ye
rin
your
sword
in
at
the
tae
side
o
him
an
out
at
the
tither
the
sooner
a
knave
like
that
is
put
down
the
better
fair
occasion
an
face
to
face
peatstacknowe
an
ye
sanna
see
charlie
scott
slack
but
ye
wadna
hae
me
stick
a
man
or
cleave
him
down
ahint
his
back
an
that
without
fair
warning
and
fair
arming
ay
honour
an
generosity
are
braw
things
but
life
a
brawer
thing
an
a
better
thing
than
ony
o
the
twa
for
my
part
i
wad
never
stop
my
very
heart
flighters
when
i
look
at
him
an
i
amaist
think
i
find
his
steel
quivering
at
my
midriff
i
wish
i
had
a
drive
at
him
wi
a
chance
o
a
hale
head
and
from
that
time
gibby
leaned
himself
forward
on
his
saddle
and
fixed
his
large
grey
eyes
on
the
mosstrooper
like
a
pointer
going
to
fly
on
his
game
and
in
that
attitude
he
rode
several
times
close
up
to
his
side
or
very
nearly
opposite
to
him
laying
his
hand
now
and
then
on
his
hilt
but
charlie
observed
that
he
never
looked
his
foe
in
the
face
with
threatening
aspect
and
perplexed
as
he
was
could
not
help
laughing
at
gibby
yardbire
now
putting
the
spurs
to
corby
galloped
aslant
the
brae
to
a
rising
ground
whence
he
could
see
if
any
enemy
was
approaching
by
the
swire
from
the
fords
of
kale
as
he
suspected
he
had
not
well
gained
the
height
before
he
saw
a
dozen
horsemen
coming
at
the
light
gallop
but
one
part
of
the
cavalcade
considerably
behind
the
others
owing
to
their
being
either
worse
mounted
or
worse
horsemen
by
this
time
charlie
own
friends
were
coming
round
the
bottom
of
the
hill
below
him
quarrelling
with
the
strangers
so
loudly
that
charlie
heard
their
voices
ascending
on
the
gale
in
most
discordant
notes
the
deil
tam
and
the
english
trooper
had
never
since
their
meeting
ceased
the
jibe
and
the
keen
retort
but
tam
words
were
so
provokingly
severe
that
the
was
driven
beyond
all
further
forbearance
just
when
they
were
at
the
hottest
the
helmets
of
the
front
men
of
the
northumberland
cavalcade
began
to
appear
in
the
swire
a
circumstance
that
was
well
noted
by
their
offended
kinsman
but
of
which
tam
was
perfectly
unconscious
well
now
thou
jaundiced
looking
thief
said
the
turning
his
horse
head
towards
tam
left
hand
and
making
him
amble
and
curvette
with
his
side
foremost
thou
lean
nerveless
and
jabberer
all
tongue
and
nothing
else
i
say
what
hast
thou
to
say
more
the
alteration
in
the
man
key
of
voice
somewhat
astounded
tam
but
his
perverse
nature
would
not
let
him
soften
his
reply
although
he
liked
as
well
to
see
others
fall
into
a
mischief
as
himself
eh
what
do
i
say
said
he
and
with
that
he
turned
his
horse
head
to
that
of
the
other
making
their
two
noses
to
meet
and
caricaturing
the
capers
he
laughed
sneeringly
and
triumphantly
in
his
face
what
do
i
say
eh
what
do
i
say
i
say
i
thought
i
heard
wind
and
smelled
it
a
wee
too
fox
that
thou
art
wild
tike
of
the
moors
dost
thou
think
tam
craik
fears
thy
prancing
and
thy
carrion
breath
or
ony
o
the
litter
of
which
thou
art
the
outwale
nay
an
capering
and
prancing
show
ought
of
a
spirit
i
can
caper
and
prance
as
well
as
thou
out
on
thee
thou
thou
what
do
say
or
what
you
say
tam
had
by
this
time
drawn
his
sword
completely
to
cow
the
englishman
and
put
him
to
silence
but
he
saw
what
tam
did
not
see
and
knew
more
than
he
i
dare
both
say
and
do
and
that
thou
shalt
find
said
the
trooper
and
forthwith
he
attacked
tam
with
all
his
prowess
who
not
quite
expecting
such
a
thing
gave
way
and
had
very
nearly
been
unhorsed
he
however
fought
stoutly
defending
himself
though
manifestly
at
the
disadvantage
the
brave
friar
at
the
first
clash
of
the
swords
wheeled
about
his
mule
and
drawing
out
a
good
sword
from
under
his
frock
for
he
wore
the
sword
on
the
one
side
and
the
cross
on
the
other
he
stretched
it
forth
pointing
it
as
if
to
thrust
it
between
them
but
addressing
himself
to
the
englishman
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
put
up
sword
again
into
its
place
or
verily
i
will
smite
thee
with
the
edge
of
sword
the
other
englishman
who
had
never
yet
opened
his
mouth
and
who
had
always
kept
apart
as
if
anxious
to
conceal
who
he
was
now
rode
briskly
up
to
the
fray
and
perceiving
the
quick
approach
of
his
friends
and
judging
his
party
quite
secure
of
victory
he
struck
up
the
friar
sword
in
apparent
derision
but
the
inveterate
laird
of
the
peatstacknowe
had
been
watching
him
all
this
time
as
one
colley
dog
watches
another
of
which
he
is
afraid
in
order
to
take
him
at
an
advantage
and
the
moment
that
his
arm
was
stretched
so
that
his
sword
came
in
contact
with
the
friar
gibby
struck
him
behind
and
that
with
such
violence
that
the
sword
ran
through
his
body
the
wounded
trooper
reined
up
his
steed
furiously
in
order
to
turn
on
his
adversary
gibby
reined
his
up
as
quickly
to
make
his
escape
but
the
convulsive
force
of
the
englishman
threw
his
horse
over
and
in
its
fall
it
tumbled
against
the
legs
of
gibby
horse
with
such
force
that
it
struck
them
all
four
from
under
him
and
both
he
and
his
rider
fell
in
a
reverse
direction
rolling
plump
over
the
wounded
warrior
and
his
forlorn
encumbered
steed
that
was
pawing
the
air
at
a
furious
rate
the
two
horses
falling
thus
on
different
sides
their
hoofs
were
and
clashing
and
rattling
away
in
a
tremendous
manner
tremendous
at
least
to
poor
gibby
whose
leg
and
thigh
being
below
his
charger
he
was
unable
to
extricate
himself
happ
davie
happ
cried
he
to
the
steed
up
you
stupid
awkward
floundering
thief
happ
davie
happ
davie
could
neither
happ
nor
weynd
but
there
he
lay
groaning
and
kicking
above
his
master
who
was
in
a
most
deplorable
plight
charlie
perceiving
the
commencement
of
the
fray
was
all
this
while
galloping
furiously
toward
the
combatants
but
the
battle
was
of
short
duration
for
the
english
trooper
seeing
his
comrade
fall
he
wist
not
how
and
the
friar
and
tam
having
both
their
swords
pointed
at
him
broke
furiously
through
between
them
and
fled
towards
his
companions
tam
being
only
enabled
to
inflict
a
deep
wound
on
the
hinder
part
of
the
horse
as
he
passed
by
i
have
made
him
to
pass
away
as
the
stubble
that
is
driven
by
the
whirlwind
said
the
friar
yea
as
the
chaff
before
the
great
wind
so
is
he
fled
from
the
arm
of
the
mighty
brother
i
say
unto
thee
that
thou
hadst
better
arise
continued
he
looking
upon
the
disconsolate
jordan
and
passing
by
on
the
other
side
with
great
he
rode
up
to
delany
the
boy
elias
and
the
poet
the
latter
of
whom
had
not
been
engaged
but
drawing
his
sword
manfully
had
stood
as
a
guard
to
the
other
two
tam
craik
pursued
his
enemy
although
apparently
not
with
a
fixed
design
of
overtaking
him
and
gibby
being
thus
left
all
alone
with
the
two
inverted
horses
and
the
incensed
extended
his
voice
to
an
amazing
pitch
for
he
knew
not
what
state
of
health
and
strength
his
opponent
retained
this
was
a
horrid
consideration
for
if
he
should
disengage
himself
and
get
up
first
there
was
an
end
of
him
of
the
peatstacknowe
his
nasal
twine
was
increased
by
his
dread
and
he
cried
so
vehemently
that
his
cries
grew
like
the
cries
of
a
peacock
charlie
scott
rode
up
to
the
main
group
who
continued
to
advance
at
a
quiet
pace
for
they
knew
nothing
as
yet
of
the
approaching
danger
he
also
called
and
made
signs
to
tam
craik
to
return
and
as
soon
as
he
came
up
to
them
he
pointed
out
their
pursuers
and
charged
them
to
ride
for
their
lives
we
are
betrayed
said
he
but
the
horses
of
our
enemies
are
jaded
ours
are
fresh
therefore
brave
lads
in
our
master
name
spare
neither
spur
nor
haud
on
your
way
an
never
look
ower
your
shoulders
you
will
find
corby
an
me
twa
gude
back
friends
the
friar
bent
himself
forward
over
the
mane
of
his
mule
and
opening
his
eyes
wide
abroad
he
put
the
spurs
to
his
steed
and
set
off
with
the
swiftness
of
the
or
the
hart
as
he
termed
it
the
boy
pursued
hard
after
him
and
the
bard
taking
hold
of
bridle
by
both
reins
below
the
neck
for
fear
her
steed
should
stumble
and
throw
his
lovely
rider
bade
her
whip
on
and
fear
nothing
and
in
this
friendly
guise
they
also
made
good
speed
charlie
then
galloped
back
to
see
if
any
life
remained
in
his
friend
gibby
for
he
only
saw
him
at
a
distance
go
down
in
the
encounter
without
being
exactly
versed
in
the
circumstances
of
his
overthrow
but
he
thought
he
heard
one
loud
squeak
arise
from
the
field
after
the
rest
had
left
it
something
like
that
sent
forth
by
the
small
drone
of
the
bagpipe
and
guessing
that
the
laird
was
yet
alive
he
galloped
back
to
see
by
the
way
he
met
the
deil
tam
who
returned
with
him
and
when
they
came
in
view
of
the
spot
where
the
two
prostrate
heroes
had
been
left
they
saw
a
very
curious
scene
the
more
curious
because
it
was
transacted
by
our
worthy
laird
in
the
presiding
belief
that
he
was
not
seen
for
he
was
too
much
concerned
in
his
own
affairs
to
perceive
the
approach

the

making
an
exertion
by
pressing
his
feet
against
the
ribs
of
the
laird

by
that
means
pushed
himself
forward
and
gibby
perceived
plainly
that
his
enemy
was
to

gibby

and
as
a

he
reared
up
his

and
struck
at
the
englishman

that
was
above
his
horse
crying
out
to
davie
to

in
bitterness
of

davie
was
not

for
the
next

after
the
englishman
horse
rose
he
got
up
also
his
feet
then
getting
to
the
ground
but
the
stirrup
that
had
been
under

was
crushed

and
the
englishman
keeping

was
released
by
the
loss
of
his
boot
he
was
not
long
in
making
a
bold
effort
to
rise
and
though
hall
hung
by
his
neck
a
little
it
had
been
in
the
last
agony
of
receding
life
that
he
had
seized
him
and
he
dropped
dead
on
the
green
having
both
fists
clenched
on
his
breast
in
the
act
of
still
holding
his
rival
when
gibby
saw
how
matters
stood
he
began
to
value
himself
on
his
courage
i

he
lifting
up

and
giving

several
desperate
gashes

always

stroke
repeating
h
i
gar
ye
his
two
friends
being
now
hard
beside
him
the
sound
of
their
horses
feet
made
him
start
but
lifting
his
eye
and
perceiving
who
they
were
he
again
repeated
his
blows
and
continued
his
threats

the

of
a
one
look
filled
gilbert
eye
he
mounted
davie
with
the
one
boot
off
and
the
other
on
and
there
was
little
occasion
to
bid
him
ride
before
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
hill
their
pursuers
came
so
close
on
them
that
they
looked
very
like
cutting
off
their
retreat
but
a
bog
around
which
the
english
were
forced
to
cast
a
wide
circuit
saved
our
three
heroes
and
gave
them
the
start
by
fully
a
half
mile
of
their
foes
who
still
came
in
a
straggling
way
as
their
horses
could
keep
up
after
a
hard
chace
of
two
scottish
miles
they
came
up
with
the
friar
whose
mule
being
too
heavy
loaden
had
begun
to
fag
when
he
saw
them
gaining
on
him
so
hard
he
judged
that
all
was
over
with
him
and
spurred
on
his
jaded
beast
in
vain
o
that
my
flesh
were
as
my
armour
or
my
clothing
cried
he
that
i
might
put
it
off
at
will
and
escape
from
the
face
of
mine
enemies
lo
i
shall
be
left
all
alone
and
surrounded
and
taken
and
slain
as
he
divined
so
it
fell
out
the
others
were
soon
by
him
and
he
was
left
the
hindermost
then
they
heard
him
lamenting
to
himself
in
his
own
sublime
eastern
stile
that
he
had
not
the
wings
of
the
eagle
or
the
dove
that
he
might
bear
away
to
the
mountains
and
the
cliffs
of
the
rocky
hills
to
elude
the
dreadful
weapons
of
death
so
often
reared
over
his
head
and
so
often
warded
by
the
arm
of
heaven

as
for

on
the
young
couple
that
are
committed
to
our
charge
may
escape
with
that
he
wheeled
corby
head
about
and
rode
back
to
meet
the
gospel
friar
when
he
met
him
the
foremost
of
the
riders
had
advanced
within
a
bow
shot
and
was
fast
gaining
ground
the
friar
still
continued
to
spur
on
and
though
his
mule
likewise
continued
the
motion
of
one
that
gallops
the
progress
that
he
made
was
hardly
discernible
he
had
a
sort
of
up
and
down
hobble
that
was
right
laughable
to
behold
in
one
riding
for
his
life
when
he
saw
the
dauntless
yardbire
return
to
meet
him
with
his
large
seven
feet
sword
drawn
and
heaved
over
his
right
shoulder
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
and
he
said
unto
him
blessed
be
thou
my
son
the
blessing
of
a
man
ready
to
perish
light
upon
thee
and
now
lo
i
will
draw
forth
my
sword
and
return
with
thee
to
the
charge
and
thou
shalt
see
what
a
poor
bedesman
can
do
it
is
brawly
said
good
friar
but
gin
ye
wad
save
yoursel
an
me

an
we
could
but
mak
the
end
o
the

if

an

father
you
an
i
shall
fight
flee
or
fa
thegither
but
see
we
are
already
overtaken
and
in
the
enemy
hands
the
foremost
of
the
riders
was
now
hard
behind
them
but
perceiving
charlie
he
reined
up
his
horse
and
looked
back
for
his
comrades
the
friar
gave
a
glance
back
and
he
said
lo
thou
art
a
mighty
man
of
valour
and
behold
there
is
but
one
do
thou
fall
upon
him
and
smite
him
why
should
one
pursue
two
i
hae
heard
waur
advices
frae
mair
warlike
men
said
charlie
ride
ye
on
father
an
lose
nae
time
gude
faith
i
sal
gie
this
ane
his
breakfast
charlie
as
he
said
this
put
the
spurs
to
corby
and
rode
full
speed
against
the
pursuer
the
trooper
set
himself
firm
in
his
stirrups
and
assumed
his
defence
for
he
saw
from
the
prowess
of
corby
that
it
was
vain
to
fly
just
as
charlie
mighty
sword
was
descending
on
his
casque
a
check
that
he
gave
his
horse
in
the
hurry
of
the
moment
made
him
rear
on
end
and
charlie
stroke
coming
down
between
his
ears
clove
his
head
almost
into
two
halves
the
horse
reeled
and
fell
but
how
it
fared
with
his
rider
charlie
never
knew
for
before
he
got
his
horse
turned
there
were
other
three
of
the
halls
close
at
hand
charlie
fled
amain
he
was
nothing
afraid
of
himself
for
he
knew
corby
could
outstrip
them
by
one
half
of
the
way
but
his
heart
bled
for
the
poor
friar
whom
he
saw
he
would
either
be
obliged
to
leave
or
fight
for
him
against
such
odds
as
it
would
be
madness
to
withstand
the
friar
had
however
gained
the
height
and
having
now
a
long
sloping
descent
all
the
way
to
the
he
was
posting
on
at
an
improved
pace
charlie
had
one
sole
hope
remaining
of
saving
the
friar
and
that
was
the
gaining
the
point
before
they
were
overtaken
the
warriors
carried
no
whips
in
those
days
depending
altogether
on
the
ample
spur
therefore
charlie
as
a
last
resource
pulled
down
a
large
branch
from
a
hazel
tree
and
attacked
the
hinder
parts
of
the
mule
with
such
a
torrent
of
strokes
that
the
animal
perhaps
more
sullen
than
exhausted
seemed
to
recover
new
life
and
vigour
and
fled
from
the
assault
like
a
deer
in
the
utmost
terror
and
dismay
little
wonder
was
it
he
heard
the
sound
of
every
descending
stroke
coming
on
like
the
gathering
tempest
and
clapping
his
tail
close
down
between
his
hips
pricking
up
his
long
ears
and
looking
back
first
with
the
one
eye
and
then
with
the
other
he
went
at
such
a
rate
that
corby
could
do
little
more
than
keep
up
with
him
my
swiftness
is
greater
than
i
can
bear
cried
the
friar
pronouncing
the
sentence
all
in
syllables
for
want
of
breath
verily
i
shall
fall
among
the
cliffs
of
the
rocks
by
the
side
of
the
highway
his
danger
increased
with
his
fears
for
the
mule
perceiving
that
exertion
availed
not
and
that
there
was
no
escaping
from
the
fierceness
of
his
pursuer
wrath
began
to
throw
up
his
heels
violently
at
every
stroke
nevertheless
continuing
to
exert
himself
between
these
evolutions
the
friar
began
to
get
into
disorder
and
with
great
difficulty
he
retained
his
seat
therefore
he
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
i
pray
of
thee
my
son
to
desist
for
it
is
better
for
me
to
perish
by
an
enemy
hand
than
thine
seest
thou
not
my
confusion
and
despair
verily
i
shall
be
dashed
in
pieces
against
the
stones
the
friar
saw
nought
of
charlie
intent
else
he
would
not
have
besought
him
so
earnestly
to
desist
the
was
now
hard
at
hand
it
is
still
well
known
as
a
long
narrow
path
alongst
the
verge
of
a
precipice
and
all
the
bank
above
it
was
then
a
thicket
of
brushwood
and
gorse
so
close
that
the
wild
beast
of
the
desart
could
not
pass
through
it
it
was
moreover
shagged
with
rocks
and
bedded
with
small
stones
and
the
path
itself
was
so
narrow
that
two
horsemen
could
scarcely
ride
abreast
by
such
a
strenuous
manoeuvre
on
the
parts
of
charlie
and
the
mule
the
two
flyers
got
into
this
path
without
having
lost
any
ground
of
their
pursuers
when
charlie
saw
this
he
began
to
breathe
more
freely
and
flinging
away
his
hazel
branch
he
again
seized
his
mighty
weapon
in
his
right
hand
let
the
chields
come
as
close
on
us
now
an
they
dare
said
he
the
mule
still
continued
to
eye
him
with
a
great
deal
of
jealousy
and
perceiving
the
brandish
that
he
gave
his
long
sword
when
he
said
this
he
set
off
again
full
speed
so
that
it
was
a
good
while
before
the
friar
got
time
to
reply
as
soon
as
he
got
leisure
to
speak
he
opened
his
mouth
and
said
my
son
wilt
thou
lift
up
thine
arm
against
a
multitude
or
canst
thou
contend
with
the
torrent
of
the
mighty
waters
well
well
they
may
perhaps
lead
that
winna
drive
said
charlie
and
he
went
by
the
friar
at
a
light
gallop
leaving
him
behind
who
prayed
to
the
other
not
to
leave
him
nor
forsake
him
but
it
was
a
device
of
yardbire
and
a
well
conceived
one
he
saw
that
as
long
as
he
kept
the
rear
guard
and
rode
behind
the
friar
the
men
that
pursued
them
would
not
separate
on
that
long
narrow
path
therefore
he
vanished
among
the
bushes
keeping
however
always
within
hearing
of
the
mule
feet
accordingly
at
the
first
turn
of
the
road
the
foremost
of
the
english
troopers
seeing
the
jolly
bedesman
posting
away
by
himself
put
the
spurs
to
his
steed
and
made
a
furious
dash
at
him
the
friar
cried
out
with
a
loud
voice
and
seeing
that
he
would
be
overtaken
he
turned
round
and
drew
his
sword
to
stand
on
the
defensive
and
actually
not
only
bore
the
first
charge
of
his
opponent
with
considerable
firmness
but
had
very
nigh
smitten
him
between
the
joints
of
the
harness
as
he
termed
it
it
happened
moreover
very
singularly
from
the
perversity
of
the
mule
that
in
the
charge
the
combatants
changed
sides
at
the
imminent
peril
of
the
englishman
for
the
mule
brushed
by
his
horse
with
such
violence
and
leaned
so
sore
to
the
one
side
that
both
the
horse
and
his
rider
were
within
an
inch
of
the
verge
of
the
precipice
the
friar
had
no
sooner
made
his
way
by
than
he
saw
another
rider
coming
like
lightning
to
meet
him
in
the
face
but
at
the
same
time
he
heard
the
voice
of
charlie
scott
behind
him
and
the
rending
crash
of
his
weapon
this
cheered
the
drooping
spirits
of
the
brave
friar
who
had
been
on
the
very
point
of
crying
for
quarter
they
beset
me
before
and
behind
cried
he
yet
shall
my
hand
be
avenged
come
on
thou
froward
and
perverse
one
so
saying
he
assumed
his
guard
and
met
his
foe
face
to
face
seeing
he
had
no
alternative
the
englishman
drew
a
stroke
but
got
not
time
to
lay
it
on
for
just
as
the
mule
and
his
tall
horse
met
the
former
in
the
bitterness
of
his
ire
rushed
between
his
opponent
and
the
upper
bank
and
pressed
against
his
fore
counters
with
such
energy
that
he
made
the
leg
next
him
to
slacken
and
the
horse
reared
from
the
other
the
intention
of
the
irritated
mule
was
to
crush
his
master
leg
or
if
possible
to
rub
him
from
off
his
back
and
therefore
in
spite
of
the
rein
he
closed
with
the
englishman
tall
steed
in
a
moment
and
almost
as
swift
as
lightning
the
english
had
raised
his
arm
to
strike
but
seeing
his
horse
shoved
and
rearing
in
that
perilous
place
he
seized
the
rein
with
his
sword
hand
the
mule
finding
the
substance
to
which
he
leaned
give
way
pressed
to
it
the
harder
it
was
all
one
to
him
whether
it
had
been
a
tree
a
horse
or
a
rock
he
shouldered
against
it
with
his
side
foremost
so
strenuously
that
in
spite
of
all
the
trooper
could
do
the
fore
feet
of
his
horse
on
rearing
alighted
within
the
verge
of
the
precipice
the
noble
animal
made
a
spring
from
his
hinder
legs
in
order
to
leap
by
the
obstreperous
mongrel
but
the
latter
still
coming
the
closer
instead
of
springing
by
he
leaped
into
the
open
void
aiming
at
the
branches
of
an
oak
that
grew
in
a
horizontal
direction
from
the
cliff
it
was
an
old
and
stubborn
tree
the
child
of
a
thousand
years
and
when
the
horse
and
his
rider
fell
upon
its
hoary
branches
it
yielded
far
to
the
weight
but
its
roots
being
entwined
in
the
rifted
rock
as
far
as
the
stomach
of
the
mountain
it
sprung
upward
again
with
a
prodigious
force
to
regain
its
primitive
position
and
tossed
the
intruding
weight
afar
into
the
unfathomed
deep
horse
and
rider
went
down
in
a
rolling
motion
till
they
lessened
to
the
eye
and
fell
on
the
rocks
and
water
below
with
such
a
shock
that
the
clash
sounded
among
the
echoes
of
the
linn
like
the
first
burst
of
the
artillery
of
heaven
or
the
roar
of
an
earthquake
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
charlie
scott
gazed
on
the
scene
with
horror
every
feature
of
his
countenance
was
changed
and
every
hair
on
his
great
burly
head
stood
on
end
he
gave
a
look
to
heaven
crossed
himself
and
said
a
short
prayer
if
a
prayer
it
may
be
called
that
consisted
only
of
four
syllables
it
consisted
merely
in
the
pronunciation
of
a
name
too
sacred
to
be
set
down
in
an
idle
tale
but
he
pronounced
it
with
an
emphasis
that
made
it
doubly
affecting
the
friar
on
the
contrary
astonished
at
his
own
prowess
or
rather
at
that
of
his
mule
beheld
the
scene
with
wonder
it
is
true
but
also
with
a
shade
of
ostentation
i
have
overthrown
the
horse
and
his
rider
said
he
and
they
are
sunk
down
as
a
stone
into
the
mighty
waters
corby
manifested
the
fright
that
he
was
in
by
loud
and
reiterated
snortings
the
mule
also
was
astonied
and
that
he
might
witness
the
horrific
scene
in
more
perfection
he
kept
his
tail
close
to
the
precipice
and
looked
back
now
by
my
honour
as
a
man
and
a
warrior
father
said
charlie
you
are
a
man
amang
ten
thousand
i
never
knew
of
a
bedesman
who
behaved
so
gallantly
nor
have
i
seen
a
knight
behave
better
how
durst
you
close
so
instantaneously
and
furiously
with
both
these
valiant
troopers
thou
hadst
better
put
that
question
to
my
mule
said
the
friar
for
it
is
a
truth
that
he
hath
that
in
him
that
is
the
ruin
of
many
people
viz
obstinacy
of
heart
when
he
smelleth
the
battle
he
disdaineth
all
parley
or
courtesy
as
thou
beholdest
but
rusheth
upon
his
adversary
like
one
of
the
bulls
of
bashan
at
that
moment
the
friar
eye
caught
a
glance
of
several
horsemen
close
upon
them
but
as
they
could
only
come
one
man
rank
they
paused
at
seeing
their
enemies
in
quiet
possession
of
the
way
and
standing
in
peaceful
colloquy
apparently
about
something
else
by
the
life
of
pharaoh
said
the
friar
gazing
all
around
i
had
forgot
the
man
whom
i
first
engaged
and
smote
as
he
passed
by
you
will
see
nae
mair
o
him
father
said
charlie
i
gae
him
a
deadly
wound
but
the
saddle
was
locked
to
the
horse
and
the
man
to
the
saddle
and
the
furious
animal
has
escaped
away
to
the
forest
with
the
dead
man
on
its
back
thou
art
indeed
a
man
of
valour
said
the
friar
and
here
will
we
keep
our
ground
i
will
do
more
in
our
defence
than
thou
hast
yet
witnessed
therefore
be
not
afraid
my
son
for
that
sword
of
thine
is
a
good
sword
it
is
a
good
sword
at
a
straik
returned
charlie
but
it
no
very
handy
at
making
a
defence
but
an
i
get
the
first
yerk
of
a
chield
no
unco
feared
for
his
return
however
father
this
sword
sic
as
it
is
shall
be
raised
in
your
defence
as
lang
as
my
arm
can
wag
it
i
like
the
man
that
will
stand
a
brush
when
a
pinch
comes
see
thae
chaps
darena
come
on
us
but
ill
luck
to
the
coward
gin
they
winna
come
to
us
we
gang
to
them
i
will
certainly
go
with
thee
said
the
friar
but
i
know
the
nature
of
the
beast
that
i
bestride
and
that
it
will
at
the
first
onset
bear
me
into
the
thickest
of
the
battle
therefore
be
not
thou
far
from
me
in
my
need
for
though
nothing
afraid
yet
i
know
it
will
carry
me
into
peril
come
let
us
go
and
smite
these
men
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
gallant
friar
said
charlie
the
is
lang
an
narrow
there
hardly
a
bit
that
they
can
come
on
us
twa
in
a
breast
stand
ye
still
or
be
chopping
on
your
way
an
i
let
you
see
yon
lads
get
a
surprise
for
aince
nay
i
will
certainly
stand
with
thee
in
battle
said
the
friar
thinkest
thou
i
will
stand
and
be
a
looker
on
when
my
preserver
is
in
jeopardy
lo
my
heart
is
as
thy
heart
my
arm
as
thy
arm
and
but
i
can
not
say
my
horse
is
as
thy
horse
for
the
beast
is
indeed
froward
in
his
ways
and
perverse
in
all
his
doings
charlie
hardly
smiled
at
the
phrase
of
the
worthy
friar
for
he
meditated
an
attack
on
their
pursuers
and
his
eye
kindled
with
his
heart
toward
the
battle
he
heaved
up
his
twice
at
its
full
stretch
to
feel
if
it
was
nowise
encumbered
in
the
armour
and
putting
corby
in
motion
he
rode
deliberately
up
to
the
face
of
his
enemies
the
foremost
man
spoke
to
him
demanding
what
he
wanted
but
he
only
answered
by
heaving
his
sword
a
little
higher
and
making
his
horse
mend
his
pace
in
one
second
after
that
he
was
engaged
with
the
first
man
and
in
two
seconds
the
horse
and
his
rider
had
fallen
in
the
middle
of
the
path
charlie
listed
not
coming
to
close
quarter
his
sword
was
so
long
and
heavy
that
it
was
quite
unhandy
in
warding
the
blows
of
a
short
and
light
weapon
his
aim
therefore
was
always
to
get
the
first
stroke
which
was
as
apt
to
light
on
the
horse
as
the
man
and
thus
down
both
of
them
went
springing
by
the
prostrate
warrior
he
attacked
the
second
and
the
third
in
the
same
manner
and
with
the
same
success
always
either
cutting
down
the
trooper
or
cleaving
the
head
of
his
horse
at
the
first
stroke
the
path
was
now
in
the
utmost
confusion
owing
to
the
pause
that
had
taken
place
all
the
riders
had
come
up
and
crowded
each
other
behind
some
crying
he
is
a
devil
and
others
at
a
greater
distance
shouting
out
down
with
the
scot
down
with
him
charlie
regarded
not
their
cries
but
laid
about
him
with
all
his
might
till
after
striking
down
three
of
the
foremost
and
one
horse
those
next
to
him
were
glad
to
turn
in
order
to
effect
their
escape
but
the
hindermost
on
the
path
refusing
for
a
while
to
give
way
many
of
their
friends
fell
a
sacrifice
to
charlie
wrath
he
pursued
them
for
a
space
and
might
have
cut
them
off
every
man
had
he
been
sure
that
all
was
safe
behind
but
he
had
rushed
by
some
wounded
men
and
wounded
horses
and
knew
not
how
matters
stood
with
the
friar
as
he
dreaded
so
it
fell
out
two
of
the
englishmen
who
had
fallen
perhaps
under
their
horses
had
scrambled
up
the
bosky
precipice
and
as
he
returned
assailed
him
with
large
stones
a
mode
of
attack
against
which
he
was
unable
to
make
the
least
resistance
therefore
it
was
at
the
utmost
peril
of
his
life
that
he
made
his
way
back
through
the
encumbered
path
to
his
friend
the
friar
this
latter
worthy
had
found
it
impossible
to
lend
his
friend
any
assistance
the
beast
that
he
bestrode
was
fonder
of
rubbing
shoulders
with
a
living
brute
than
a
mangled
or
dead
one
so
he
refused
to
come
nearer
the
first
that
fell
than
about
twice
his
own
length
where
he
stood
firm
turning
his
tail
to
the
scene
of
battle
and
looking
back
our
two
heroes
now
set
off
at
full
speed
after
the
rest
of
their
party
whom
they
expected
to
overtake
before
reaching
the
outposts
of
the
beleaguering
army
chapter
xii
i
saw
the
appearance
of
a
mounted
warrior
whence
did
it
come
or
whither
did
it
go
or
whom
did
it
seek
here
hush
thee
my
lord
the
apparition
spoke
not
but
passed
on
is
something
dreadful
and
i
fear
me
much
betokens
evil
to
this
fair
array
of
the
the
rest
of
our
cavalcade
continued
to
advance
at
a
quick
pace
not
without
anxiety
they
were
not
afraid
of
their
enemies
coming
behind
them
for
they
had
strong
faith
in
the
prowess
of
their
friend
as
well
as
his
horse
corby
but
when
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
narrow
path
called
the
there
were
two
roads
and
they
knew
not
which
of
these
to
follow
as
bad
luck
would
have
it
they
took
the
most
easterly
which
led
towards
yetholm
and
left
the
scottish
army
to
the
westward
in
that
path
they
continued
to
jog
on
turning
many
a
long
look
behind
them
for
the
approach
of
charlie
and
at
one
time
they
thought
they
got
a
view
of
him
coming
at
a
furious
pace
all
alone
but
the
rider
being
at
a
great
space
behind
them
he
was
shortly
hid
from
their
view
in
an
intervening
hollow
and
it
was
long
before
they
saw
him
any
more
they
judged
that
the
friar
was
taken
or
slain
and
began
to
talk
of
his
loss
in
a
very
indifferent
manner
alas
how
frigid
and
ungenial
must
be
the
hearts
of
you
men
in
scotland
said
delany
now
of
all
the
men
i
have
met
with
since
i
was
brought
from
my
own
country
there
is
only
one
whose
death
i
would
more
regret
than
that
of
the
worthy
and
kind
friar
he
may
have
his
whims
and
his
peculiarities
but
his
manner
is
pleasing
and
his
speech
has
a
strain
of
grandeur
which
i
love
where
did
he
acquire
that
speech
he
gets
it
frae
some
beuk
said
tam
that
he
has
pored
on
a
his
days
an
translatit
out
o
other
tongues
till
he
was
nearly
hanged
for
it
and
it
weel
kend
that
he
is
now
in
hiding
wi
our
warden
for
fear
o
his
life
and
has
been
these
half
dozen
o
years
and
though
he
pretends
to
be
only
a
friar
he
was
aince
a
monk
o
the
first
order
of
st
benedict
and
president
of
a
grand
college
in
france
i
would
like
to
converse
with
him
said
delany
for
i
have
always
thought
that
he
feigned
to
be
something
a
degree
lower
than
he
is
you
said
there
was
you
would
lament
the
loss
of
more
said
the
poet
pray
who
may
that
be
could
you
not
guess
returned
she
how
can
i
said
he
but
this
i
know
that
to
be
the
favoured
one
i
would
dive
into
the
depths
of
the
ocean
it
wad
be
for
fear
then
said
tam
or
traverse
the
regions
of
ice
continued
the
bard
or
wander
barefoot
over
burning
sands
or
o
alak
for
your
poor
feet
said
delany
interrupting
him
but
rest
satisfied
you
shall
not
be
put
to
the
test
it
is
not
you
with
such
kind
of
chat
did
they
beguile
the
way
till
elias
looking
back
exclaimed
mercy
see
what
a
guise
yardbire
is
coming
in
st
mary
protect
us
said
the
maid
he
must
be
grievously
wounded
see
how
he
rides
every
one
turned
round
his
horse
and
looked
at
the
approaching
warrior
but
it
was
wearing
late
and
they
could
not
see
with
distinctness
the
horse
was
coming
rapidly
and
with
apparent
impatience
but
charlie
appeared
as
if
he
were
riding
in
his
sleep
when
the
horse
came
down
hill
he
bent
forward
and
on
climbing
an
ascent
he
bent
back
riding
with
that
sort
of
motion
as
if
his
back
or
neck
were
out
of
joint
the
whole
group
showed
manifest
signs
of
fear
at
the
approach
of
such
a
hideous
apparition
and
quite
in
earnest
though
in
a
pretended
frolic
they
wheeled
about
again
and
gallopped
away
the
ground
being
uneven
and
the
coming
on
they
soon
lost
sight
of
him
and
continuing
their
career
as
fast
as
the
road
would
permit
they
seemed
inclined
to
escape
from
their
friend
altogether
the
maid
had
just
begun
to
remonstrate
on
their
unfriendly
procedure
when
they
beheld
the
same
unaccountable
figure
coming
at
the
full
gallop
close
behind
them
seeing
that
he
was
determined
to
be
of
the
party
they
suffered
him
to
overtake
them
quietly
he
came
driving
furiously
up
till
he
was
in
the
middle
of
them
and
then
paused
no
one
had
the
courage
to
speak
to
him
for
he
looked
not
up
nor
regarded
any
of
them
his
helmed
head
nodded
on
his
breast
and
his
arms
hung
loosely
down
by
his
side
the
steel
armlets
rattling
on
the
cuishes
at
one
time
his
horse
came
so
near
to
that
on
which
delany
rode
that
she
weened
she
saw
the
rider
all
covered
with
blood
and
screamed
out
yet
in
the
twilight
she
could
not
be
certain
the
poet
who
was
never
far
from
her
side
and
on
whom
her
voice
always
acted
like
electricity
immediately
demanded
the
cause
of
her
alarm
o
carol
said
she
in
an
agitated
whisper
we
are
haunted
that
is
a
dead
man
that
rides
in
our
company
if
the
maid
was
alarmed
the
poet
was
ten
times
more
so
if
she
had
said
that
a
lion
or
a
bear
was
in
the
company
it
could
not
have
struck
such
a
chillness
to
the
poor
bard
heart
and
after
all
it
was
no
wonder
for
there
is
something
exceedingly
appalling
in
the
idea
of
having
a
dead
man
riding
in
one
company
the
poet
felt
this
in
its
fullest
measure
he
held
in
his
horse
and
attempted
a
reply
but
a
dryness
pervaded
his
mouth
so
much
that
he
could
not
make
himself
intelligible
a
damp
had
fallen
on
the
whole
party
and
a
breathless
silence
prevailed
tam
put
the
question
so
natural
to
him
as
he
passed
charlie
is
this
you
but
none
answered
or
regarded
they
were
riding
up
a
slanting
hill
when
the
bard
was
first
apprised
of
the
nature
of
their
guest
and
shortly
after
the
figure
coming
between
him
and
the
evening
sky
its
motions
were
altogether
so
hideous
that
he
roared
out
in
perfect
terror
as
loud
as
he
could
bray
scarce
letting
one
bellow
await
another
this
was
still
worse
than
the
dumb
appalling
uncertainty
in
which
they
were
before
involved
till
at
last
tam
losing
all
patience
let
loose
his
rage
against
the
poet
calling
him
a
bellowing
beast
and
many
other
opprobrious
names
this
encouraging
gibbie
who
had
the
bard
at
no
good
will
on
account
of
the
damsel
he
said
he
brought
him
amind
of
a
story
that
the
o
annandale
tauld
about
andrew
jardine
bull
that
was
better
at
booing
than
breeding
the
boy
elias
now
coming
in
behind
them
and
having
heard
what
delany
said
cried
softly
hush
yeomen
hush
we
are
haunted
it
is
a
ghost
that
rides
in
our
company
they
all
turned
their
eyes
to
the
mysterious
figure
which
they
still
thought
resembled
their
champion
yardbire
as
well
as
the
horse
did
that
which
he
rode
the
redoubted
corby
the
horse
had
started
a
little
forward
at
the
cries
of
the
poet
but
when
the
rest
paused
the
figure
seemed
to
wheel
his
horse
around
and
made
a
dead
pause
also
standing
still
with
his
face
toward
them
and
straight
on
the
path
before
not
one
durst
proceed
the
figure
neither
moved
nor
threatened
but
stood
nodding
its
head
on
the
height
at
every
motion
of
the
steed
yet
our
party
were
arrested
on
their
way
nor
knew
they
exactly
in
what
place
they
were
but
from
the
length
of
the
way
they
had
come
they
were
sure
they
were
near
the
scottish
army
on
one
side
or
other
and
free
from
any
danger
of
the
foes
they
had
left
behind
them
on
the
border
none
of
them
were
good
guides
in
any
case
and
a
man
in
fear
is
neither
a
fit
guide
for
himself
nor
others
fear
had
the
sway
and
fear
gave
the
word
of
command
without
being
disputed
the
poet
was
the
first
to
strike
from
the
beaten
path
and
it
was
at
no
easy
pace
that
he
rode
he
turned
westward
and
the
rest
all
followed
with
main
speed
their
progress
was
soon
interrupted
by
a
strong
cattle
fence
made
of
stakes
and
the
branches
of
trees
interwoven
bespeaking
the
vicinity
of
some
village
or
place
of
human
habitation
they
soon
broke
through
the
fence
but
by
bad
luck
did
not
take
time
to
make
up
the
breach
which
they
left
open
and
posting
forward
came
to
a
large
house
amid
a
number
of
smaller
ones
the
poet
called
for
admittance
in
a
moving
and
earnest
stile
and
at
once
resolved
to
take
no
denial
before
ever
he
paused
he
told
them
he
and
his
party
had
lost
their
way
and
that
they
had
seen
a
ghost
then
you
must
be
some
murderers
said
the
men
of
the
house
and
here
you
remain
not
we
belong
to
the
warden
of
the
marches
the
brave
baron
of
mountcomyn
said
the
poet
and
go
on
an
errand
of
great
import
to
the
army
in
that
case
we
might
demand
what
we
only
ask
as
a
boon
namely
such
lodging
as
the
house
affords
you
had
better
keep
that
part
to
yourself
said
the
men
of
the
house
though
sir
ringan
is
supreme
in
the
middle
marches
he
is
no
favourite
here
our
master
name
is
ker
he
is
with
the
douglas
but
may
be
home
calm
sough
and
kitchen
fare
or
ride
on
it
brings
me
in
mind
o
an
auld
proverb
said
gibbie
that
beggars
should
nae
be
choisers
sae
honest
lads
bring
us
a
light
for
our
horses
are
sair
tired
an
maun
be
weel
put
up
the
party
it
will
be
remembered
consisted
only
of
five
exclusive
of
charlie
and
the
friar
they
had
draw
up
their
horses
close
to
the
hall
door
and
were
still
on
horseback
when
the
men
turned
into
the
house
for
a
light
the
poet
whose
eager
eyes
were
still
on
the
watch
chancing
to
look
at
the
heads
of
his
associates
between
him
and
the
sky
thought
he
discovered
one
too
many
surely
there
are
six
of
us
he
in
a
hurried
tremulous
voice
six
of
us
said
tam
as
doubting
the
statement
six
of
us
no
surely
said
delany
at
that
instant
a
lad
came
out
with
a
lanthorn
and
held
it
up
to
look
at
the
party
the
poet
was
nearest
the
door
and
the
light
shone
full
on
him
and
the
rider
that
was
next
him
he
cast
his
eyes
on
that
rider
but
one
glance
was
enough
to
bedim
his
if
not
to
scare
away
his
reason
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
warrior
sheathed
in
steel
but
all
encrusted
in
a
sheet
of
blood
his
mouth
was
wide
open
and
his
jaws
hanging
down
upon
his
breast
while
his
head
seemed
to
be
cleft
asunder
the
poet
uttered
a
loud
yell
of
horror
and
flinging
himself
from
his
horse
on
the
side
opposite
to
that
on
which
the
phantom
stood
he
fell
among
the
mud
and
stones
at
the
door
yet
ceased
not
to
reiterate
his
loud
cries
like
one
in
distraction
every
one
jumped
from
his
horse
and
hurried
in
at
the
door
the
man
with
the
lanthorn
also
fled
and
with
the
noise
and
uproar
the
horses
galloped
off
saddled
and
bridled
as
they
were
as
the
guests
ran
into
the
hall
every
one
asked
at
all
the
rest
what
it
was
what
is
it
was
all
that
could
be
heard
all
asking
the
question
but
none
answering
it
even
the
people
of
the
house
joined
in
the
query
and
came
all
round
the
strangers
crying
what
is
it
what
is
it
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
sir
i
do
not
know
upon
my
word
the
people
are
all
delirious
said
the
housekeeper
can
no
one
tell
us
what
it
was
that
affrighted
you
st
magdalene
be
with
us
whom
have
we
here
this
was
no
other
than
the
poor
bard
coming
toward
the
light
creeping
slowly
on
and
still
groaning
as
he
came
here
the
chap
that
began
the
fray
said
tam
you
may
speer
at
him
he
rather
looks
as
he
were
at
ane
mae
for
my
part
i
just
did
as
the
rest
did
ran
an
cried
as
loud
as
i
could
when
a
dust
is
fairly
begun
i
think
aye
the
mair
stour
that
is
raised
the
better
i
try
wha
will
cry
loudest
again
an
ye
like
or
rin
round
the
fire
wi
ony
o
you
or
out
through
the
mids
either
at
a
pinch
tam
turned
round
his
long
nose
to
see
if
his
jest
had
taken
for
he
always
fixed
his
eyes
stedfastly
on
one
object
when
he
spoke
but
he
found
that
his
jargon
had
been
for
no
one
laughed
at
it
but
himself
the
rest
were
gathered
round
the
bard
some
pitying
but
more
like
to
burst
with
laughter
at
his
forlorn
state
he
fetched
two
or
three
moans
and
then
raising
himself
up
on
his
knees
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
light
he
rolled
over
and
fainted
delany
first
stooped
to
support
his
head
and
was
soon
assisted
by
every
female
in
the
house
while
the
men
only
stood
and
looked
on
by
bathing
his
hands
and
temples
with
cold
water
they
soon
brought
him
out
of
his
faint
but
not
to
his
right
senses
his
looks
continued
wild
and
unstable
and
ever
and
anon
they
were
turned
to
the
door
as
if
he
expected
some
other
guest
to
enter
a
sober
conference
at
last
ensued
and
as
no
one
had
seen
or
heard
any
thing
at
this
last
encounter
save
the
man
that
was
taken
ill
who
a
few
moments
before
had
been
heard
to
say
were
six
of
all
began
to
agree
that
he
had
been
seized
with
some
sudden
frenzy
or
delirium
till
the
lad
who
had
carried
out
the
light
thrust
in
his
pale
face
among
the
rest
and
said
na
na
my
masters
it
is
nae
for
naething
that
the
honest
man
gane
away
in
a
kink
for
when
i
held
up
the
bouet
i
saw
a
dead
man
riding
on
a
horse
close
at
his
side
he
was
berkened
wi
blood
off
at
the
taes
and
his
mouth
was
open
and
i
saw
his
tongue
hinging
out
it
may
well
be
conceived
what
an
icy
chillness
these
words
distilled
round
the
heart
of
every
one
present
the
effect
on
our
travellers
was
particularly
appalling
from
the
idea
that
they
were
haunted
by
a
phantom
from
which
they
could
not
escape
the
whole
group
closed
around
the
fire
and
the
strangers
recounted
to
the
family
the
singular
occurrence
of
their
having
lost
two
of
their
number
by
the
way
and
been
pursued
and
overtaken
by
a
phantom
resembling
one
of
them
and
that
the
hideous
spectre
was
as
it
seemed
haunting
them
still
as
they
all
agreed
in
the
same
story
it
was
not
of
a
nature
to
be
disregarded
at
a
period
when
superstition
swayed
the
hearts
of
men
with
irresistible
power
the
stoutest
heart
among
them
was
daunted
and
no
one
durst
go
out
to
the
vaults
to
look
after
his
master
cattle
nor
to
take
in
our
travellers
horses
that
were
left
to
shift
for
themselves
during
the
long
winter
night
the
next
morning
between
and
the
the
men
began
to
peep
abroad
and
the
first
things
they
observed
were
some
of
the
horses
of
our
travellers
going
about
in
a
careless
easy
manner
this
they
looked
on
as
a
good
omen
knowing
that
horses
were
terrified
for
spirits
and
the
men
joining
in
a
body
they
sallied
out
to
reconnoitre
the
horses
had
fared
well
for
they
had
fed
at
the
laird
stacks
of
hay
and
corn
all
night
but
as
the
men
were
going
round
to
see
how
matters
stood
they
perceived
a
phenomenon
that
if
it
had
not
been
open
would
have
scared
them
from
the
habitation
this
was
the
identical
still
sitting
unmoved
on
his
horse
that
was
helping
itself
full
liberally
out
of
one
of
the
laird
the
eye
of
day
expels
the
films
of
superstition
from
the
human
eye
the
men
after
a
short
consultation
ventured
to
surround
the
phantom
to
seize
his
horse
who
had
given
full
proof
that
he
at
least
was
flesh
and
blood
and
after
a
good
deal
of
trembling
astonishment
they
found
that
he
was
actually
rode
by
a
dead
warrior
whose
head
was
cleft
asunder
and
his
whole
body
both
within
and
without
the
harness
encrusted
in
blood
the
mystery
was
soon
cleared
up
but
none
then
knew
who
he
was
it
had
become
customary
in
that
age
for
warriors
who
went
to
engage
others
on
horseback
to
lock
themselves
to
the
saddle
for
fear
of
being
borne
out
of
their
seats
by
the
spears
of
their
opponents
in
the
encounter
this
was
the
individual
trooper
who
had
come
foremost
in
the
pursuit
of
our
party
he
whom
the
friar
jostled
and
whom
charlie
encountering
the
moment
after
had
slain
but
his
suit
of
armour
having
kept
him
nearly
upright
in
his
saddle
his
horse
had
run
off
with
him
and
followed
after
those
of
our
travellers
as
every
horse
will
do
that
is
let
go
on
a
and
gets
his
will
glad
were
our
travellers
at
an
eclaircissement
so
fairly
within
the
bounds
of
their
comprehension
and
when
the
poet
saw
the
gash
made
in
the
helmet
he
shook
his
head
and
exclaimed
ha
well
i
wot
the
mighty
hand
of
charlie
has
been
here
gibbie
remarked
that
he
himself
had
killed
one
very
like
him
only
he
was
sure
his
wad
never
mount
horse
again
but
seeing
tam
eye
fixed
on
him
he
was
afraid
of
something
coming
out
relating
to
that
encounter
which
he
did
not
wish
to
hear
blabbed
so
he
changed
his
tone
and
looking
wise
said
the
hale
business
brings
me
of
a
very
good
story
that
happened
aince
at
allergrain
an
if
it
be
nae
true
it
is
behadden
to
the
maker
for
the
sin
o
the
lie
lyes
nae
at
my
door
the
story
you
see
is
there
was
a
man
an
he
had
a
wife
they
had
a
son
an
they
him
jock
now
d
n
your
particularity
said
tam
craik
think
you
we
have
nought
else
to
do
but
stand
beside
the
bloody
man
and
listen
to
a
tale
like
that
the
poet
muttered
over
some
old
rhyme
in
unison
with
what
he
heard
if
one
word
spoken
chanced
to
occur
in
any
old
rhyme
or
song
that
he
knew
he
went
over
the
sentence
to
himself
though
it
had
no
farther
connection
with
it
or
resemblance
to
it
than
merely
that
word
this
made
his
conversation
altogether
incomprehensible
to
those
not
acquainted
with
him
but
it
was
always
delightful
to
himself
a
chance
old
rhyme
brought
to
his
remembrance
would
have
pleased
him
almost
in
any
circumstances
while
his
words
chimed
naturally
into
measure
leaving
the
dead
warrior
at
the
house
where
they
lodged
for
the
people
to
bury
as
they
liked
they
proceeded
to
the
army
in
hopes
of
finding
charlie
and
the
friar
there
for
without
them
they
did
not
know
how
to
accomplish
their
mission
these
two
heroes
finding
on
asking
at
a
hamlet
that
their
friends
had
not
passed
on
the
road
to
roxburgh
suspected
what
way
they
had
gone
and
turning
to
the
they
followed
them
on
the
track
to
yetholm
but
misled
them
at
the
house
into
which
they
had
been
chased
by
the
dead
man
and
rode
searching
for
them
the
greater
part
of
the
night
next
morning
they
again
went
in
search
of
them
and
came
up
behind
them
at
the
convent
of
maisondieu
near
to
the
teviot
where
a
detachment
of
the
army
was
stationed
and
after
conversing
two
or
three
hours
on
the
state
of
the
army
and
garrison
they
proceeded
on
their
journey
and
reached
the
abbey
of
melrose
that
night
there
they
were
welcomed
by
the
brethren
and
lodged
comfortably
there
also
they
got
many
strange
stories
told
to
them
about
master
michael
scott
which
made
the
very
hairs
of
their
heads
stand
on
end
and
the
hearts
of
the
boldest
to
palpitate
when
the
friar
heard
them
he
seemed
wrapt
in
deep
thought
and
he
opened
his
mouth
and
said
if
the
things
that
thou
hast
spoken
be
according
to
the
light
that
is
in
thee
and
the
truth
that
is
told
among
men
then
this
man
is
not
as
other
men
for
the
spirit
of
the
immortals
is
in
him
and
he
communeth
with
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
nevertheless
i
will
go
unto
him
and
i
will
speak
to
him
face
to
face
as
a
man
speaketh
to
his
friend
peradventure
i
shall
tell
him
that
which
he
knoweth
not
when
it
was
told
to
the
abbot
lawrence
that
the
servants
of
the
warden
were
come
and
that
they
were
accompanied
by
his
chaplain
and
bedesman
a
learned
man
in
all
holy
things
the
father
came
to
bestow
upon
them
his
benediction
for
the
baron
of
mountcomyn
had
conferred
many
rich
benefices
on
the
abbey
at
the
first
sound
of
the
friar
voice
the
abbot
started
as
if
recollecting
him
but
on
looking
at
the
man
his
hope
seemed
to
die
away
every
time
however
that
he
spoke
in
his
eastern
style
the
abbot
fixed
a
look
on
him
as
if
he
would
fain
have
claimed
acquaintance
which
the
friar
perceiving
urged
their
departure
with
all
the
interest
he
had
and
accordingly
about
they
set
out
for
the
seat
of
the
renowned
magician
master
michael
scott
ever
since
the
stern
encounter
with
the
english
on
the
charlie
had
attached
himself
close
to
the
friar
imagining
that
he
saw
his
character
in
a
new
light
and
that
he
was
one
who
might
either
be
roused
to
desperate
courage
or
impressed
with
notorious
dread
and
when
he
heard
him
say
that
he
would
speak
to
the
enchanter
face
to
face
he
admired
him
still
the
more
for
the
business
of
addressing
the
master
was
that
which
stuck
sorest
on
the
stomach
of
the
doughty
yardbire
as
for
the
poet
he
scarcely
seemed
himself
all
that
day
he
looked
at
the
mountains
and
the
wild
romantic
rivers
branching
among
them
in
every
direction
with
looks
of
which
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
they
were
looks
of
vacancy
or
affection
for
he
looked
sometimes
as
at
objects
which
he
was
never
to
see
again
his
tongue
muttered
long
rhymes
in
which
his
heart
had
little
share
so
that
delany
was
obliged
to
detach
herself
from
his
society
and
make
up
to
the
friar
whom
she
now
addressed
with
much
affection
and
some
degree
of
coquetry
dearest
father
why
have
you
neglected
me
so
much
on
our
journey
ever
since
our
first
stage
was
got
over
you
have
not
deigned
to
take
any
notice
of
me
what
have
you
seen
in
my
conduct
that
you
have
thus
shunned
me
it
is
in
sincerity
that
i
assure
you
there
is
no
man
in
whose
conversation
i
so
much
delight
fairest
among
maidens
said
the
friar
putting
his
arm
gently
around
her
neck
as
her
palfrey
came
close
up
by
his
side
say
not
so
but
come
near
me
i
will
kiss
thee
with
the
kisses
of
my
mouth
for
thy
love
is
sweeter
to
me
than
the
vintage
behold
thou
art
even
like
a
tower
of
alabaster
shining
from
among
the
cedars
of
lebanon
thy
bosom
resembleth
two
young
roes
that
are
twins
and
feed
among
the
lilies
of
the
valley
hold
dear
father
said
she
and
do
not
let
your
gallantry
run
away
with
your
good
common
sense
yet
would
i
love
to
hear
that
language
spoken
to
another
for
though
it
be
nonsense
it
is
still
beautiful
tell
me
for
i
long
to
hear
where
or
in
what
country
you
learned
to
speak
in
that
stile
daughter
of
my
people
said
he
i
have
learned
that
language
at
home
and
in
a
far
country
in
youth
and
in
age
hath
it
been
my
delight
at
when
the
sun
shone
in
his
strength
and
in
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
hath
it
been
my
meditation
in
adversity
hath
it
been
my
comfort
and
in
prosperity
my
joy
so
that
now
it
hath
become
unto
me
as
my
mother
tongue
and
other
language
have
i
none
is
it
the
language
of
the
convent
and
the
priory
alone
said
the
maid
no
thou
rose
of
the
desart
said
the
friar
it
is
not
the
language
indeed
but
the
stile
of
language
over
one
half
of
the
habitable
world
it
is
the
language
of
all
the
kingdoms
and
countries
of
the
east
from
india
even
unto
ethiopia
and
all
the
way
as
thou
goest
down
towards
the
rising
of
the
sun
yea
from
the
river
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
it
prevaileth
but
o
thou
fairest
among
the
daughters
of
women
that
language
did
i
not
learn
in
the
lands
that
are
watered
by
the
great
river
even
the
river
euphrates
in
ur
of
the
chaldees
have
i
not
sojourned
nor
on
the
mountains
of
palestine
have
i
lifted
up
my
eyes
but
i
learned
it
from
one
little
book
a
book
that
is
of
more
value
to
the
children
of
men
than
all
the
gold
of
ophir
o
maiden
could
i
but
make
known
unto
thee
the
treasures
of
that
book
the
majesty
of
its
stile
and
the
excellency
of
its
precepts
it
would
make
thine
heart
to
sing
for
joy
if
all
the
writings
of
this
world
yea
if
the
world
itself
were
to
be
laid
in
the
balance
with
that
book
they
would
be
found
wanting
the
mountains
may
depart
and
the
seas
may
pass
away
the
stars
and
the
heavens
in
which
they
shine
may
be
removed
but
the
words
of
that
book
shall
remain
for
ever
and
ever
and
this
language
that
i
now
speak
to
thee
resembleth
the
words
written
therein
and
i
speak
them
unto
thee
that
thou
mayest
hear
and
love
them
dear
friar
teach
me
to
read
and
understand
that
book
for
my
breast
yearneth
to
know
more
about
it
i
am
it
is
true
not
my
own
at
present
to
give
but
i
have
some
forebodings
here
that
tell
me
i
soon
shall
and
father
i
will
serve
thee
and
be
thy
handmaid
if
thou
wilt
teach
me
the
words
and
the
mysteries
of
that
little
book
alas
and
wo
is
me
for
the
ignorance
of
my
people
said
he
with
the
tears
streaming
over
his
grim
cheek
they
are
troubled
about
that
which
availeth
them
nothing
while
the
way
of
life
is
hid
from
their
eyes
their
leaders
have
caused
them
to
err
and
i
even
i
have
been
a
dweller
in
the
tabernacles
of
sin
but
the
hath
shone
upon
my
soul
and
my
spirit
for
that
have
i
been
persecuted
and
hunted
as
a
partridge
upon
the
mountains
chased
from
the
habitations
of
my
brethren
and
forced
to
dwell
among
a
strange
and
savage
people
yet
there
are
among
them
whom
i
love
and
could
i
be
the
mean
of
opening
thine
eyes
and
turning
thee
from
darkness
unto
light
then
would
i
know
for
what
purpose
the
finger
of
heaven
had
pointed
out
my
way
to
this
barren
wilderness
thou
not
be
a
servant
or
a
handmaiden
unto
one
who
is
little
better
than
an
outcast
and
a
vagabond
on
the
earth
but
better
days
may
come
to
us
both
i
am
not
what
i
seem
but
maiden
thou
mayest
trust
me
my
love
for
thee
surpasseth
the
love
of
women
for
it
is
with
more
than
an
earthly
love
that
i
behold
and
delight
in
thee
come
unto
me
this
night
and
i
will
tell
thee
things
that
shall
make
thine
ears
tingle
the
book
of
wonders
is
here
with
me
and
thou
mayest
look
thereon
and
be
glad
the
poet
and
his
associates
listened
to
this
rhapsody
apart
what
book
does
he
mean
said
the
poet
if
it
is
not
true
book
or
the
book
of
sir
gawin
he
must
be
speaking
absolute
nonsense
i
could
recite
these
to
lovely
delany

this
clumsy
old
friar

like
marion
jock
when
he

jock
to
himself

and
swim
in

loch
like
sae
mony
drakes
but
me
i
am
fain
either
to
poutter
about
the
side
or
down
i
gang
i
can
neither
sink
nor
swim
for
when
i
try
to
get
to
the
bottom
to
creep
there
i
stick
like
a
woundit
paddock
wagging
my
arms
and
my
legs
and
can
neither
get
to
the
top
nor
the
bottom
just
half
way
there
stick
i
but
i
be
even
hands
wi
them
an
mair
an
then
laugh
at
the
leishest
o
them
for
i

and
wade
and

ower
the
waves
afore
them
a
aye
and
that
wi
my
head
boonmost
jock
after
this
grand
contrivance
coudna
rest
but
off
he
sets
to
hawick
and
gets
four
big
blawn
bladders
and
the
next
day
when
a
the
lave
went
to
bathe
jock
he
went
to
bathe
amang
the
rest
and
he
gangs
slyly
into
a
bush
by
himsel
and
ties
twa
o
the
bladders
to
every
foot
thinks
jock
let
them
see
a
trick
sae
he
slips
into
the
loch
and
wades
into
the
deep
but
the
bladders
they
aye
gart
him
hobble
and
bob
up
and
down
till
faith
he
loses
the
balance
and
ower
he
coups
nane
o
them
kend
o
jock
great
plan
and
they
were
a
like
to
burst
their
sides
wi
laughing
when
they
saw
jock
diving
but
when
they
saw
he
wasna
like
to
come
up
again
they
swattered
away
to
the
place
and
there
was
jock
swimming
wi
his
head
straight
to
the
bottom
and
his
feet
and
the
four
bladders
walking
a
minuay
aboon
now
let
me
tell
ye
an
ye
lippen
to
the
friar
warlockry
and
his
enchantments
and
divinations
ye
trust
to
as
mony
bladders
fu
o
wind
and
down
gae
your
heads
and
your
heels
uppermost
na
na
nane
maun
try
to
cope
auld
michael
i
hae
heard
indeed
that
he
coudna
brook
ony
rivalry
said
charlie
and
i
hae
heard
waur
instances
and
waur
stories
too
than
that
yours
laird
but
let
us
draw
slyly
near
to
the
twasome
and
make
lang
lugs
to
try
if
we
can
learn
ony
mair
about
that
same
beuk
if
the
friar
hae
ony
power
o
enchantment
it
is
my
opinion
the
first
glamour
thraw
will
be
ower
that
bonny
wench
we
ought
to
keep
them
asunder
by
force
said
the
poet
it
would
be
a
shame
and
a
disgrace
to
us
if
we
were
to
let
the
auld
rogue
seduce
either
her
person
or
her
morals
morals
said
charlie
i
dinna
ken
about
them
for
i
watna
weel
what
they
are
but
as
to
seducing
hersel
i
think
i
could
answer
for
auld
roger
the
friar
i
see
there
nae
man
can
help
liking
a
bonny
lass
but
the
better
a
good
man
likes
ane
he
be
the
mair
sweer
to
do
her
ony
skaith
aye
but
then
how
can
an
enchanter
be
a
good
man
said
the
poet
that
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
said
charlie
let
us
hear
what
they
are
on
about
sae
briskly
now
they
then
drew
near
and
heard
the
following
words
while
the
remarks
that
they
made
were
said
aside
among
themselves
my
fate
you
see
has
been
a
strange
one
father
i
was
separated
from
my
parents
so
young
that
i
scarcely
remember
them
but
the
scots
have
been
kind
to
me
and
i
have
loved
them
i
have
never
been
unhappy
except
when
long
confined
to
a
place
which
i
dislike
exceedingly
and
as
i
have
hopes
that
this
change
will
add
somewhat
to
my
freedom
i
rejoice
in
it
without
weighing
circumstances
if
those
fond
hopes
should
be
realised
i
promise
to
you
father
that
the
first
use
i
will
make
of
my
liberty
shall
be
to
sit
at
your
feet
and
learn
that
wonderful
and
mysterious
book
do
you
hear
that
said
the
poet
with
great
emphasis
but
in
a
half
whisper
he
has
gotten
her
broken
already
to
learn
the
book
of
the
black
art
then
the
deil
bargain
and
witchcraft
comes
next
then
the
harassing
of
the
whole
country
side
dancing
in
kirkyards
and
riding
on
the
wind
and
then
mayhap
the
stake
and
the
faggot
end
the
matter
that
is
but
just
beginning
alak
and
wo
is
me
i
say
in
the
king
name
and
in
the
warden
let
them
be
separated
gude
sauf
us
exclaimed
charlie
there
nae
man
sure
o
his
life
an
a
this
be
true
but
a
fair
play
nae
self
amang
us
hist
and
let
us
hear
what
he
is
saying
in
answer
daughter
said
the
friar
half
crying
with
joy
doth
not
my
heart
yearn
over
thee
even
as
a
mother
yearneth
over
the
child
of
her
bosom
lo
i
will
be
unto
thee
as
a
father
and
thou
shalt
be
unto
me
as
a
daughter
hear
what
the
old
rascal
is
saying
said
the
poet
and
behold
the
fruits
of
our
labours
shall
spring
up
into
life
oh
this
is
past
all
sufferance
said
the
poet
for
o
thou
fair
one
whose
beauty
is
as
the
beauty
of
the
morning
and
whose
innocence
surpasseth
that
of
the
kid
or
the
lamb
or
the
young
roe
when
they
are
playing
upon
the
mountains
gude
faith
mr
carol
said
charlie
aside
it
that
auld
chap
the
poet
an
no
you
humph
mere
fustian
said
the
poet
the
friar
still
went
on
that
beauty
will
decay
as
the
rose
fadeth
on
the
brows
of
shinar
or
hermon
and
that
innocence
shall
be
perverted
by
the
sinful
and
regardless
people
among
whom
thou
sojournest
and
shall
become
as
it
were
betrothed
to
sin
and
corruption
yea
and
that
eye
that
shineth
like
the
dews
of
the
morning
shall
be
darkened
but
o
beloved
maiden
there
is
that
in
this
little
book
yea
i
say
unto
thee
even
in
this
old
neglected
and
despised
book
that
unto
those
who
learn
it
shall
prove
the
savour
of
life
unto
life
and
if
thou
dost
learn
and
cherish
the
things
contained
in
this
book
thou
shalt
never
die
ay
billy
that
is
a
yanker
said
tam
aside
when
ane
is
gaun
to
tell
a
lie
there
naething
like
telling
a
plumper
at
aince
and
being
done
now
but
hear
to
the
deceitful
old
rogue
said
the
poet
all
the
books
of
black
art
in
the
world
can
not
accomplish
that
in
the
name
of
saint
barnabas
i
say
let
them
be
separated
it
wad
be
weel
done
said
tam
if
ane
durst
for
he
wanted
to
blow
up
the
poet
wrath
for
the
sake
of
a
little
sport
durst
said
the
poet
durst
if
none
other
dare
i
shall
in
spite
of
all
his
hellish
arts
durst
that
is
a
good
one
to
be
dursted
with
an
old
sackbut
they
did
not
hear
what
answer
delany
made
to
the
extraordinary
information
as
they
took
it
that
by
learning
the
little
black
book
she
was
to
be
redeemed
from
death
for
the
fierce
jealousy
of
the
enamoured
bard
prevented
them
but
when
they
listened
again
so
as
to
hear
distinctly
the
friar
was
still
increasing
in
fervency
all
that
he
said
was
in
raptures
of
divine
ecstacy
while
his
associates
who
knew
nothing
and
cared
as
little
about
these
things
understood
it
in
another
way
for
i
say
unto
thee
if
thou
wilt
suffer
me
to
instil
these
truths
into
thee
thou
shalt
both
blossom
and
bring
forth
fruit
abundantly
yea
thou
shalt
shine
as
the
stars
in
the
firmament
of
heaven
seest
thou
yon
sun
that
walketh
above
the
clouds
in
majesty
and
brightness
beyond
yon
sun
shall
thine
habitation
be
fixed
and
the
blue
arch
that
encircles
the
regions
of
the
air
which
thou
hast
so
often
seen
studded
over
with
diamonds
shall
be
unto
thee
a
pavement
whereon
thou
shalt
tread
all
this
and
more
shalt
thou
possess
if
thou
wilt
learn
and
obey
the
things
that
are
written
in
this
book
where
it
is
said
by
one
that
can
not
err
i
will
be
always
with
you
and
my
arms
shall
be
underneath
and
around
you
and
when
you
are
faint
and
weary
i
will
hide
you
in
my
bosom
for
the
blood
that
is
in
your
body
dare
to
attempt
such
a
thing
cried
the
enraged
poet
down
with
hypocrisy
and
sensuality
together
hurray
for
the
combat
and
god
defend
the
right
so
crying
as
loud
as
he
could
yell
he
pulled
out
his
sword
and
rode
furiously
up
between
delany
and
the
friar
shoving
the
latter
rudely
as
he
passed
the
maiden
palfrey
sprung
away
but
the
friar
mule
only
leaned
with
all
his
might
to
the
poet
steed
as
he
pressed
against
him
in
passing
and
feeling
his
prop
give
way
he
leaned
round
in
the
same
direction
till
his
tail
was
exactly
where
his
head
was
before
and
then
dreading
some
abhorred
exertion
he
set
his
feet
asunder
and
stood
immovable
the
poet
drew
up
and
wheeled
about
and
seeing
still
the
hinder
parts
of
the
friar
and
his
beast
he
cried
exultingly
ay
you
are
more
ready
to
seduce
an
innocent
and
lovely
maiden
than
to
answer
for
the
crime
vile
lump
of
sin
and
hypocrisy
turn
round
and
meet
me
face
to
face
that
i
may
chastise
thee
for
thy
graceless
attempt
the
friar
spurred
most
furiously
but
the
mule
only
dashed
his
head
downward
and
his
heels
in
a
contrary
direction
and
kept
his
position
all
the
rest
were
like
to
burst
with
laughter
which
still
increasing
the
bard
insolence
he
fumed
about
enchantments
and
the
black
art
and
dared
the
friar
to
turn
and
look
him
in
the
face
what
with
one
provocation
what
with
another
the
friar
angry
passions
were
roused
and
not
being
able
to
make
his
mule
turn
round
he
drew
out
his
sword
saying
at
the
same
time
in
a
voice
of
great
vehemence
god
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
i
make
not
he
got
no
farther
with
his
speech
for
the
mule
interrupted
him
obstinate
as
the
brute
was
the
sight
of
the
sword
and
the
sound
of
his
master
angry
voice
operated
on
him
like
magic
perhaps
he
understood
that
all
further
opposition
was
vain
for
in
one
moment
he
wheeled
around
his
eyes
gleaming
with
rage
and
pricking
up
his
ears
to
see
where
the
storm
of
his
and
his
master
wrath
was
to
alight
he
perceived
the
poet
on
his
tall
steed
brandishing
his
dazzling
sword
and
forthwith
darted
at
them
with
the
swiftness
of
an
arrow
and
a
fury
not
to
be
checked
there
were
no
more
words
nor
threatenings
passed
between
the
enraged
combatants
for
more
space
of
time
there
was
none
before
the
mule
had
his
shoulder
to
that
of
the
poet
steed
his
teeth
fixed
in
his
flank
and
was
pushing
with
the
fury
of
an
enraged
bull
on
the
closing
of
the
two
steeds
the
riders
likewise
engaged
the
poet
coming
on
with
a
downward
stroke
which
the
friar
received
with
great
indifference
on
his
sword
crossed
above
his
cowl
but
knowing
well
the
nature
of
his
beast
he
kept
up
the
poet
sword
and
arm
both
until
the
sides
of
the
two
animals
were
jammed
together
as
the
rider
of
the
mule
well
knew
they
would
be
by
that
time
the
poet
arm
was
pressed
up
straight
by
his
ear
and
his
sword
pointed
to
heaven
and
in
endeavouring
to
free
his
elbow
from
the
hilt
of
the
friar
sword
he
lost
his
balance
at
the
same
instant
their
feet
encountering
in
the
stirrups
and
the
friar
being
below
that
of
his
opponent
he
gave
him
such
a
ketch
with
his
right
foot
and
together
that
he
made
him
fly
from
his
horse
to
a
great
distance
in
a
sort
of
arching
direction
and
the
unfortunate
poet
falling
on
his
shoulder
and
head
was
wofully
bruised
and
utterly
discomfited
but
the
combat
ended
not
here
the
mule
still
struggled
with
his
adversary
which
not
only
kept
his
ground
but
rather
began
to
force
the
mule
to
give
way
but
the
inveterate
mongrel
was
not
to
be
vanquished
in
that
way
he
pressed
struggled
and
wrought
himself
round
till
he
got
his
tail
to
the
horse
shoulder
and
then
he
attacked
him
furiously
with
his
the
horse
being
a
horse
of
spirit
and
scorning
to
yield
to
his
adversary
applied
the
same
offensive
weapons
with
very
little
ceremony
wincing
and
screaming
all
the
while
and
sometimes
making
his
feet
to
fly
as
high
as
the
friar
elbows
the
mule
fought
with
desperate
energy
but
in
profound
silence
not
so
the
rider
he
spurred
struck
with
his
sword
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
soh
tproo
thou
beast
of
the
pit
sure
the
spirit
of
the
evil
one
is
in
thee
lo
i
shall
be
beaten
to
pieces
for
the
heels
of
the
horses
are
lifted
up
against
me
by
the
life
of
pharaoh
i
will
smite
thee
until
thy
blood
shall
be
poured
out
like
water
thou
perverse
and
abominable
beast
i
say
unto
thee
go
forward
the
voice
of
the
friar
during
this
passionate
declamation
had
arisen
gradually
until
the
last
sentence
which
was
pronounced
in
his
utmost
stile
of
vehemence
the
mule
heard
this
and
saw
the
uplifted
sword
and
not
awaiting
its
descent
he
sprang
forward
with
main
force
but
no
man
will
guess
the
issue
it
may
well
be
conceived
that
during
this
desperate
combat
between
the
horse
and
mule
the
onlookers
were
convulsed
with
laughter
charlie
scott
in
particular
laughed
with
a
so
loud
that
he
made
all
the
woods
around
to
ring
and
at
every
breath
exclaimed
gude
faith
i
never
saw
ought
half
so
grand
na
never
gibbie
was
advanced
a
little
before
the
rest
so
as
to
be
near
the
scene
of
action
which
without
doubt
was
bringing
him
in
mind
of
some
excellent
story
for
his
mouth
was
formed
like
a
seam
from
the
one
ear
to
the
other
but
it
is
dangerous
putting
one
self
too
forward
in
life
and
that
the
poor
laird
of
the
peatstacknowe
soon
found
it
is
well
known
that
between
parties
so
closely
connected
as
the
horse
and
his
rider
passion
begets
passion
the
mule
driven
altogether
furious
by
the
broil
and
the
rage
and
spurs
of
his
master
either
wished
to
rub
himself
rid
of
him
or
deemed
that
it
was
to
be
a
battle
general
for
he
no
sooner
rushed
from
one
fray
than
he
flew
to
another
quite
on
gibbie
and
seizing
him
by
the
thigh
he
separated
one
limb
of
his
buffskin
breeches
and
a
mouthful
of
the
laird
own
skin
from
their
places
in
one
moment
and
the
next
had
his
teeth
fixed
in
the
flank
of
the
laird
horse
gibbie
cried
out
against
the
friar
irritated
by
pain
as
well
as
the
awkward
and
dangerous
situation
in
which
he
was
thus
momently
placed
his
horse
flung
the
mule
returned
the
compliment
with
hearty
good
will
and
glad
was
gibbie
to
escape
which
he
did
with
great
celerity
as
soon
as
he
got
leisure
to
use
the
spurs
the
mule
ran
straight
at
the
next
horse
and
then
at
the
next
again
but
all
of
them
scampered
off
at
his
approach
and
left
him
master
of
the
field
on
which
he
turned
two
or
three
times
sullenly
round
throwing
himself
up
behind
and
down
before
the
friar
wrath
was
somewhat
diverted
by
the
shouts
of
laughter
from
his
scattered
compeers
and
he
only
smiled
grimly
as
he
said
to
his
contumacious
beast
thou
art
even
a
perverse
and
an
evil
one
nevertheless
thou
hast
been
to
me
a
beast
for
these
many
years
and
hast
borne
me
in
distant
pilgrimages
through
many
perils
and
dangers
and
i
will
not
act
the
part
of
the
son
of
bosor
peradventure
thou
mayest
amend
thy
ways
and
do
some
credit
to
old
age
the
laird
in
his
escape
gallopped
by
the
forlorn
poet
who
raising
up
his
head
and
perceiving
the
plight
of
the
dismayed
and
unoffensive
wight
scouring
off
with
the
one
thigh
naked
and
bleeding
burst
out
into
a
hysteric
giggle
between
laughing
and
crying
and
repeated
some
scraps
of
old
rhyme
no
way
connected
with
the
incident
the
attention
of
the
party
was
now
turned
to
him
and
the
friar
as
much
as
any
who
enquired
with
great
simplicity
my
brother
why
was
thine
arm
lifted
up
against
me
the
bard
was
dreadfully
abashed
and
out
of
countenance
and
he
only
answered
in
rhymes
of
which
none
of
them
could
make
any
thing
his
arm
was
strong
and
his
heart
was
stout
and
he
broke
the
tower
and
he
got
out
then
the
king
he
was
an
angry
man
and
an
angry
man
was
he
and
he
said
go
lock
him
in
prison
strong
and
hunger
him
till
he
dee
that
was
a
hard
weird
was
it
not
there
be
many
such
for
he
had
his
wale
of
seven
sisters
of
lith
and
lire
and
limb
so
fair
but
the
loathly
dame
of
the
hazelrig
she
ruined
his
peace
for
evermair
lo
my
son
answered
the
friar
thy
thoughts
are
wandering
in
a
wilderness
i
only
ask
thee
wherein
i
have
offended
thee
for
as
mine
hand
is
so
is
mine
heart
and
as
my
soul
liveth
i
know
not
in
what
respect
i
have
done
thee
wrong
i
have
not
done
thee
wrong
fair
may
i
have
not
done
thee
wrong
but
the
cup
of
death
has
passed
my
lips
and
my
life
will
not
be
long
no
no
dame
delany
you
need
not
bathe
my
temples
i
am
not
raving
i
am
not
even
hurt
the
mischievous
beast
made
my
horse
throw
me
but
i
am
nothing
the
worse
the
friar
not
being
able
to
make
any
thing
of
the
poet
himself
applied
to
the
rest
and
was
soon
informed
by
tam
that
he
was
overheard
trying
to
gar
the
lassie
learn
the
black
art
and
courting
her
to
nae
good
and
the
poet
grew
jealous
and
was
for
being
revenged
the
friar
uttered
a
loud
groan
for
the
ignorance
of
his
associates
but
hopeless
of
making
any
thing
of
them
at
such
a
period
he
only
began
to
moralise
in
a
general
manner
the
poet
was
again
gotten
to
mount
and
shortly
after
they
reached
the
ancient
town
of
selkirk
where
they
halted
and
refreshed
themselves
at
the
monastery
of
the
cistertians
there
the
laird
got
his
wound
dressed
and
his
dilapidated
robes
refitted
and
that
same
evening
the
party
reached
