the
glimpses
of
the
moon
by
edith
wharton
part
i
i
it
rose
for
them
their
over
the
waters
of
a
lake
so
famed
as
the
scene
of
romantic
raptures
that
they
were
rather
proud
of
not
having
been
afraid
to
choose
it
as
the
setting
of
their
own
it
required
a
total
lack
of
humour
or
as
great
a
gift
for
it
as
ours
to
risk
the
experiment
susy
lansing
opined
as
they
hung
over
the
inevitable
marble
balustrade
and
watched
their
tutelary
orb
roll
its
magic
carpet
across
the
waters
to
their
feet
yes
or
the
loan
of
strefford
s
villa
her
husband
emended
glancing
upward
through
the
branches
at
a
long
low
patch
of
paleness
to
which
the
moonlight
was
beginning
to
give
the
form
of
a
white
oh
come
when
we
d
five
to
choose
from
at
least
if
you
count
the
chicago
so
we
had
you
wonder
he
laid
his
hand
on
hers
and
his
touch
renewed
the
sense
of
marvelling
exultation
which
the
deliberate
survey
of
their
adventure
always
roused
in
her
it
was
characteristic
that
she
merely
added
in
her
steady
laughing
tone
or
not
counting
the
flat
for
i
hate
to
brag
just
consider
the
others
violet
melrose
s
place
at
versailles
your
aunt
s
villa
at
monte
carlo
and
a
moor
she
was
conscious
of
throwing
in
the
moor
tentatively
and
yet
with
a
somewhat
exaggerated
emphasis
as
if
to
make
sure
that
he
shouldn
t
accuse
her
of
slurring
it
over
but
he
seemed
to
have
no
desire
to
do
so
poor
old
fred
he
merely
remarked
and
she
breathed
out
carelessly
oh
well
his
hand
still
lay
on
hers
and
for
a
long
interval
while
they
stood
silent
in
the
enveloping
loveliness
of
the
night
she
was
aware
only
of
the
warm
current
running
from
palm
to
palm
as
the
moonlight
below
them
drew
its
line
of
magic
from
shore
to
shore
nick
lansing
spoke
at
last
versailles
in
may
would
have
been
impossible
all
our
paris
crowd
would
have
run
us
down
within
hours
and
monte
carlo
is
ruled
out
because
it
s
exactly
the
kind
of
place
everybody
expected
us
to
go
so
with
all
respect
to
you
it
wasn
t
much
of
a
mental
strain
to
decide
on
his
wife
instantly
challenged
this
belittling
of
her
capacity
it
took
a
good
deal
of
argument
to
convince
you
that
we
could
face
the
ridicule
of
como
well
i
should
have
preferred
something
in
a
lower
key
at
least
i
thought
i
should
till
we
got
here
now
i
see
that
this
place
is
idiotic
unless
one
is
perfectly
happy
and
that
then
it
s
as
good
as
any
she
sighed
out
a
blissful
assent
and
i
must
say
that
streffy
has
done
things
to
a
turn
even
the
cigars
who
do
you
suppose
gave
him
those
cigars
she
added
thoughtfully
you
ll
miss
them
when
we
have
to
oh
i
say
don
t
let
s
talk
about
going
aren
t
we
outside
of
time
and
space
smell
that
stuff
over
there
what
is
it
stephanotis
y
yes
i
suppose
so
or
gardenias
oh
the
look
there
against
that
splash
of
moonlight
on
the
water
apples
of
silver
in
a
of
gold
they
leaned
together
one
flesh
from
shoulder
to
their
eyes
held
by
the
snared
glitter
of
the
ripples
i
could
bear
lansing
remarked
even
a
nightingale
at
this
moment
a
faint
gurgle
shook
the
magnolias
behind
them
and
a
long
liquid
whisper
answered
it
from
the
thicket
of
laurel
above
their
heads
it
s
a
little
late
in
the
year
for
them
they
re
ending
just
as
we
susy
laughed
i
hope
when
our
turn
comes
we
shall
say
to
each
other
as
it
was
in
her
husband
s
mind
to
answer
they
re
not
saying
but
only
settling
down
to
family
but
as
this
did
not
happen
to
be
in
his
plan
or
in
susy
s
he
merely
echoed
her
laugh
and
pressed
her
closer
the
spring
night
drew
them
into
its
deepening
embrace
the
ripples
of
the
lake
had
gradually
widened
and
faded
into
a
silken
smoothness
and
high
above
the
mountains
the
moon
was
turning
from
gold
to
white
in
a
sky
powdered
with
vanishing
stars
across
the
lake
the
lights
of
a
little
town
went
out
one
after
another
and
the
distant
shore
became
a
floating
blackness
a
breeze
that
rose
and
sank
brushed
their
faces
with
the
scents
of
the
garden
once
it
blew
out
over
the
water
a
great
white
moth
like
a
drifting
magnolia
petal
the
nightingales
had
paused
and
the
trickle
of
the
fountain
behind
the
house
grew
suddenly
insistent
when
susy
spoke
it
was
in
a
voice
languid
with
visions
i
have
been
thinking
she
said
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
make
it
last
at
least
a
year
her
husband
received
the
remark
without
any
sign
of
surprise
or
disapprobation
his
answer
showed
that
he
not
only
understood
her
but
had
been
inwardly
following
the
same
train
of
thought
you
mean
he
enquired
after
a
pause
without
counting
your
grandmother
s
pearls
yes
without
the
he
pondered
a
while
and
then
rejoined
in
a
tender
whisper
tell
me
again
just
let
s
sit
down
then
no
i
like
the
cushions
he
stretched
himself
in
a
long
willow
chair
and
she
curled
up
on
a
heap
of
and
leaned
her
head
against
his
knee
just
above
her
when
she
lifted
her
lids
she
saw
bits
of
sky
incrusted
like
silver
in
a
sharp
black
patterning
of
all
about
them
breathed
of
peace
and
beauty
and
stability
and
her
happiness
was
so
acute
that
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
remember
the
stormy
background
of
bills
and
borrowing
against
which
its
frail
structure
had
been
reared
people
with
a
balance
can
t
be
as
happy
as
all
this
susy
mused
letting
the
moonlight
filter
through
her
lazy
lashes
people
with
a
balance
had
always
been
susy
branch
s
bugbear
they
were
still
and
more
dangerously
to
be
susy
lansing
s
she
detested
them
detested
them
doubly
as
the
natural
enemies
of
mankind
and
as
the
people
one
always
had
to
put
one
s
self
out
for
the
greater
part
of
her
life
having
been
passed
among
them
she
knew
nearly
all
that
there
was
to
know
about
them
and
judged
them
with
the
contemptuous
lucidity
of
nearly
twenty
years
of
dependence
but
at
the
present
moment
her
animosity
was
diminished
not
only
by
the
softening
effect
of
love
but
by
the
fact
that
she
had
got
out
of
those
very
people
more
yes
ever
so
much
more
than
she
and
nick
in
their
hours
of
most
reckless
planning
had
ever
dared
to
hope
for
after
all
we
owe
them
this
she
mused
her
husband
lost
in
the
drowsy
beatitude
of
the
hour
had
not
repeated
his
question
but
she
was
still
on
the
trail
of
the
thought
he
had
started
a
year
yes
she
was
sure
now
that
with
a
little
management
they
could
have
a
whole
year
of
it
it
was
their
marriage
their
being
together
and
away
from
bores
and
bothers
in
a
comradeship
of
which
both
of
them
had
long
ago
guessed
the
immediate
pleasure
but
she
at
least
had
never
imagined
the
deeper
harmony
it
was
at
one
of
their
earliest
meetings
at
one
of
the
heterogeneous
dinners
that
the
fred
gillows
tried
to
think
literary
that
the
young
man
who
chanced
to
sit
next
to
her
and
of
whom
it
was
vaguely
rumoured
that
he
had
written
had
presented
himself
to
her
imagination
as
the
sort
of
luxury
to
which
susy
branch
heiress
might
conceivably
have
treated
herself
as
a
crowning
folly
susy
branch
pauper
was
fond
of
picturing
how
this
fancied
double
would
employ
her
millions
it
was
one
of
her
chief
grievances
against
her
rich
friends
that
they
disposed
of
theirs
so
unimaginatively
i
d
rather
have
a
husband
like
that
than
a
she
had
thought
at
the
end
of
her
talk
with
the
young
man
who
had
written
and
as
to
whom
it
had
at
once
been
clear
to
her
that
nothing
his
pen
had
produced
or
might
hereafter
set
down
would
put
him
in
a
position
to
offer
his
wife
anything
more
costly
than
a
his
wife
as
if
he
could
ever
have
one
for
he
s
not
the
kind
to
marry
for
a
yacht
in
spite
of
her
past
susy
had
preserved
enough
inner
independence
to
detect
the
latent
signs
of
it
in
others
and
also
to
ascribe
it
impulsively
to
those
of
the
opposite
sex
who
happened
to
interest
her
she
had
a
natural
contempt
for
people
who
gloried
in
what
they
need
only
have
endured
she
herself
meant
eventually
to
marry
because
one
couldn
t
forever
hang
on
to
rich
people
but
she
was
going
to
wait
till
she
found
some
one
who
combined
the
maximum
of
wealth
with
at
least
a
minimum
of
companionableness
she
had
at
once
perceived
young
lansing
s
case
to
be
exactly
the
opposite
he
was
as
poor
as
he
could
be
and
as
companionable
as
it
was
possible
to
imagine
she
therefore
decided
to
see
as
much
of
him
as
her
hurried
and
entangled
life
permitted
and
this
thanks
to
a
series
of
adroit
adjustments
turned
out
to
be
a
good
deal
they
met
frequently
all
the
rest
of
that
winter
so
frequently
that
fred
gillow
one
day
abruptly
and
sharply
gave
susy
to
understand
that
she
was
making
herself
ah
said
susy
with
a
long
breath
looking
her
friend
and
patroness
straight
in
the
painted
eyes
yes
cried
ursula
gillow
in
a
sob
before
you
interfered
nick
liked
me
awfully
and
of
course
i
don
t
want
to
reproach
you
but
when
i
think
susy
made
no
answer
how
could
she
when
she
thought
the
dress
she
had
on
had
been
given
her
by
ursula
ursula
s
motor
had
carried
her
to
the
feast
from
which
they
were
both
returning
she
counted
on
spending
the
following
august
with
the
gillows
at
newport
and
the
only
alternative
was
to
go
to
california
with
the
bockheimers
whom
she
had
hitherto
refused
even
to
dine
with
of
course
what
you
fancy
is
perfect
nonsense
ursula
and
as
to
my
interfering
susy
hesitated
and
then
murmured
but
if
it
will
make
you
any
happier
i
ll
arrange
to
see
him
less
often
she
sounded
the
lowest
depths
of
subservience
in
returning
ursula
s
tearful
kiss
susy
branch
had
a
masculine
respect
for
her
word
and
the
next
day
she
put
on
her
most
becoming
hat
and
sought
out
young
lansing
in
his
lodgings
she
was
determined
to
keep
her
promise
to
ursula
but
she
meant
to
look
her
best
when
she
did
it
she
knew
at
what
time
the
young
man
was
likely
to
be
found
for
he
was
doing
a
dreary
job
on
a
popular
encyclopaedia
v
to
x
and
had
told
her
what
hours
were
dedicated
to
the
hateful
task
oh
if
only
it
were
a
novel
she
thought
as
she
mounted
his
dingy
stairs
but
immediately
reflected
that
if
it
were
the
kind
that
she
could
bear
to
read
it
probably
wouldn
t
bring
him
in
much
more
than
his
encyclopaedia
miss
branch
had
her
standards
in
literature
the
apartment
to
which
lansing
admitted
her
was
a
good
deal
cleaner
but
hardly
less
dingy
than
his
staircase
susy
knowing
him
to
be
addicted
to
oriental
archaeology
had
pictured
him
in
a
bare
room
adorned
by
a
single
chinese
bronze
of
flawless
shape
or
by
some
precious
fragment
of
asiatic
pottery
but
such
redeeming
features
were
conspicuously
absent
and
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
disguise
the
decent
indigence
of
the
lansing
welcomed
his
visitor
with
every
sign
of
pleasure
and
with
apparent
indifference
as
to
what
she
thought
of
his
furniture
he
seemed
to
be
conscious
only
of
his
luck
in
seeing
her
on
a
day
when
they
had
not
expected
to
meet
this
made
susy
all
the
sorrier
to
execute
her
promise
and
the
gladder
that
she
had
put
on
her
prettiest
hat
and
for
a
moment
or
two
she
looked
at
him
in
silence
from
under
its
conniving
brim
warm
as
their
mutual
liking
was
lansing
had
never
said
a
word
of
love
to
her
but
this
was
no
deterrent
to
his
visitor
whose
habit
it
was
to
speak
her
meaning
clearly
when
there
were
no
reasons
worldly
or
pecuniary
for
its
concealment
after
a
moment
therefore
she
told
him
why
she
had
come
it
was
a
nuisance
of
course
but
he
would
understand
ursula
gillow
was
jealous
and
they
would
have
to
give
up
seeing
each
other
the
young
man
s
burst
of
laughter
was
music
to
her
for
after
all
she
had
been
rather
afraid
that
being
devoted
to
ursula
might
be
as
much
in
his
day
s
work
as
doing
the
encyclopaedia
but
i
give
you
my
word
it
s
a
mistake
and
i
don
t
believe
she
ever
meant
me
to
begin
with
he
protested
but
susy
her
returning
with
her
reassurance
promptly
cut
short
his
denial
you
can
trust
ursula
to
make
herself
clear
on
such
occasions
and
it
doesn
t
make
any
difference
what
you
think
all
that
matters
is
what
she
oh
come
i
ve
got
a
word
to
say
about
that
too
haven
t
i
susy
looked
slowly
and
consideringly
about
the
room
there
was
nothing
in
it
absolutely
nothing
to
show
that
he
had
ever
possessed
a
spare
dollar
or
accepted
a
present
not
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
she
finally
pronounced
how
do
you
mean
if
i
m
as
free
as
air
i
m
he
grew
thoughtful
oh
then
of
course
it
only
seems
a
little
odd
he
added
drily
that
in
that
case
the
protest
should
have
come
from
instead
of
coming
from
my
millionaire
bridegroom
oh
i
haven
t
any
in
that
respect
i
m
as
free
as
well
then
haven
t
we
only
got
to
stay
free
susy
drew
her
brows
together
anxiously
it
was
going
to
be
rather
more
difficult
than
she
had
supposed
i
said
i
was
as
free
in
that
respect
i
m
not
going
to
marry
and
i
don
t
suppose
you
are
god
no
he
ejaculated
fervently
but
that
doesn
t
always
imply
complete
freedom
he
stood
just
above
her
leaning
his
elbow
against
the
hideous
black
marble
arch
that
framed
his
fireless
grate
as
she
glanced
up
she
saw
his
face
harden
and
the
colour
flew
to
hers
was
that
what
you
came
to
tell
me
he
asked
oh
you
don
t
understand
and
i
don
t
see
why
you
don
t
since
we
ve
knocked
about
so
long
among
exactly
the
same
kind
of
she
stood
up
impulsively
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
i
do
wish
you
d
help
me
he
remained
motionless
letting
the
hand
lie
untouched
help
you
to
tell
me
that
poor
ursula
was
a
pretext
but
that
there
is
someone
who
for
one
reason
or
another
really
has
a
right
to
object
to
your
seeing
me
too
often
susy
laughed
impatiently
you
talk
like
the
hero
of
a
novel
the
kind
my
governess
used
to
read
in
the
first
place
i
should
never
recognize
that
kind
of
right
as
you
call
it
never
then
what
kind
do
you
he
asked
with
a
clearing
brow
why
the
kind
i
suppose
you
recognize
on
the
part
of
your
this
evoked
a
hollow
laugh
from
him
a
business
claim
call
it
she
pursued
ursula
does
a
lot
for
me
i
live
on
her
for
half
the
year
this
dress
i
ve
got
on
now
is
one
she
gave
me
her
motor
is
going
to
take
me
to
a
dinner
i
m
going
to
spend
next
summer
with
her
at
newport
if
i
don
t
i
ve
got
to
go
to
california
with
the
bockheimers
so
suddenly
in
tears
she
was
out
of
the
door
and
down
his
steep
three
flights
before
he
could
stop
her
though
in
thinking
it
over
she
didn
t
even
remember
if
he
had
tried
to
she
only
recalled
having
stood
a
long
time
on
the
corner
of
fifth
avenue
in
the
harsh
winter
radiance
waiting
till
a
break
in
the
torrent
of
motors
laden
with
fashionable
women
should
let
her
cross
and
saying
to
herself
after
all
i
might
have
promised
ursula
and
kept
on
seeing
him
instead
of
which
when
lansing
wrote
the
next
day
entreating
a
word
with
her
she
had
sent
back
a
friendly
but
firm
refusal
and
had
managed
soon
afterward
to
get
taken
to
canada
for
a
fortnight
s
and
then
to
florida
for
six
weeks
in
a
as
she
reached
this
point
in
her
retrospect
the
remembrance
of
florida
called
up
a
vision
of
moonlit
waters
magnolia
fragrance
and
balmy
airs
merging
with
the
circumambient
sweetness
it
laid
a
drowsy
spell
upon
her
lids
yes
there
had
been
a
bad
moment
but
it
was
over
and
she
was
here
safe
and
blissful
and
with
nick
and
this
was
his
knee
her
head
rested
on
and
they
had
a
year
ahead
of
them
a
whole
year
not
counting
the
pearls
she
murmured
shutting
her
eyes
ii
lansing
threw
the
end
of
strefford
s
expensive
cigar
into
the
lake
and
bent
over
his
wife
poor
child
she
had
fallen
asleep
he
leaned
back
and
stared
up
again
at
the
sky
how
queer
how
inexpressibly
queer
it
was
to
think
that
that
light
was
shed
by
his
a
year
ago
if
anyone
had
predicted
his
risking
such
an
adventure
he
would
have
replied
by
asking
to
be
locked
up
at
the
first
symptoms
there
was
still
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
the
adventure
was
a
mad
one
it
was
all
very
well
for
susy
to
remind
him
twenty
times
a
day
that
they
had
pulled
it
off
and
so
why
should
he
worry
even
in
the
light
of
her
cleverness
and
of
his
own
present
bliss
he
knew
the
future
would
not
bear
the
examination
of
sober
thought
and
as
he
sat
there
in
the
summer
moonlight
with
her
head
on
his
knee
he
tried
to
recapitulate
the
successive
steps
that
had
landed
them
on
streffy
s
on
lansing
s
side
no
doubt
it
dated
back
to
his
leaving
harvard
with
the
large
resolve
not
to
miss
anything
there
stood
the
evergreen
tree
of
life
the
four
rivers
flowing
from
its
foot
and
on
every
one
of
the
four
currents
he
meant
to
launch
his
little
skiff
on
two
of
them
he
had
not
gone
very
far
on
the
third
he
had
nearly
stuck
in
the
mud
but
the
fourth
had
carried
him
to
the
very
heart
of
wonder
it
was
the
stream
of
his
lively
imagination
of
his
inexhaustible
interest
in
every
form
of
beauty
and
strangeness
and
folly
on
this
stream
sitting
in
the
stout
little
craft
of
his
poverty
his
insignificance
and
his
independence
he
had
made
some
notable
voyages
and
so
when
susy
branch
whom
he
had
sought
out
through
a
new
york
season
as
the
prettiest
and
most
amusing
girl
in
sight
had
surprised
him
with
the
contradictory
revelation
of
her
modern
sense
of
expediency
and
her
standard
of
good
faith
he
had
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
put
off
on
one
more
cruise
into
the
unknown
it
was
of
the
essence
of
the
adventure
that
after
her
one
brief
visit
to
his
lodgings
he
should
have
kept
his
promise
and
not
tried
to
see
her
again
even
if
her
straightforwardness
had
not
roused
his
emulation
his
understanding
of
her
difficulties
would
have
moved
his
pity
he
knew
on
how
frail
a
thread
the
popularity
of
the
penniless
hangs
and
how
miserably
a
girl
like
susy
was
the
sport
of
other
people
s
moods
and
whims
it
was
a
part
of
his
difficulty
and
of
hers
that
to
get
what
they
liked
they
so
often
had
to
do
what
they
disliked
but
the
keeping
of
his
promise
was
a
greater
bore
than
he
had
expected
susy
branch
had
become
a
delightful
habit
in
a
life
where
most
of
the
fixed
things
were
dull
and
her
disappearance
had
made
it
suddenly
clear
to
him
that
his
resources
were
growing
more
and
more
limited
much
that
had
once
amused
him
hugely
now
amused
him
less
or
not
at
all
a
good
part
of
his
world
of
wonder
had
shrunk
to
a
village
and
the
things
which
had
kept
their
stimulating
power
distant
journeys
the
enjoyment
of
art
the
contact
with
new
scenes
and
strange
societies
were
becoming
less
and
less
attainable
lansing
had
never
had
more
than
a
pittance
he
had
spent
rather
too
much
of
it
in
his
first
plunge
into
life
and
the
best
he
could
look
forward
to
was
a
of
mitigated
by
brief
and
frugal
holidays
he
knew
that
he
was
more
intelligent
than
the
average
but
he
had
long
since
concluded
that
his
talents
were
not
marketable
of
the
thin
volume
of
sonnets
which
a
friendly
publisher
had
launched
for
him
just
seventy
copies
had
been
sold
and
though
his
essay
on
chinese
influences
in
greek
art
had
created
a
passing
stir
it
had
resulted
in
controversial
correspondence
and
dinner
invitations
rather
than
in
more
substantial
benefits
there
seemed
in
short
no
prospect
of
his
ever
earning
money
and
his
restricted
future
made
him
attach
an
increasing
value
to
the
kind
of
friendship
that
susy
branch
had
given
him
apart
from
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
her
and
listening
to
her
of
enjoying
in
her
what
others
less
discriminatingly
but
as
liberally
appreciated
he
had
the
sense
between
himself
and
her
of
a
kind
of
of
precocious
tolerance
and
irony
they
had
both
in
early
youth
taken
the
measure
of
the
world
they
happened
to
live
in
they
knew
just
what
it
was
worth
to
them
and
for
what
reasons
and
the
community
of
these
reasons
lent
to
their
intimacy
its
last
exquisite
touch
and
now
because
of
some
jealous
whim
of
a
dissatisfied
fool
of
a
woman
as
to
whom
he
felt
himself
no
more
to
blame
than
any
young
man
who
has
paid
for
good
dinners
by
good
manners
he
was
to
be
deprived
of
the
one
complete
companionship
he
had
ever
known
his
thoughts
travelled
on
he
recalled
the
long
dull
spring
in
new
york
after
his
break
with
susy
the
weary
grind
on
his
last
articles
his
listless
speculations
as
to
the
cheapest
and
least
boring
way
of
disposing
of
the
summer
and
then
the
amazing
luck
of
going
reluctantly
and
at
the
last
minute
to
spend
a
sunday
with
the
poor
nat
fulmers
in
the
wilds
of
new
hampshire
and
of
finding
susy
there
susy
whom
he
had
never
even
suspected
of
knowing
anybody
in
the
fulmers
set
she
had
behaved
perfectly
and
so
had
he
but
they
were
obviously
much
too
glad
to
see
each
other
and
then
it
was
unsettling
to
be
with
her
in
such
a
house
as
the
fulmers
away
from
the
large
setting
of
luxury
they
were
both
used
to
in
the
cramped
cottage
where
their
host
had
his
studio
in
the
verandah
their
hostess
practiced
her
violin
in
the
and
five
ubiquitous
children
sprawled
and
shouted
and
blew
trumpets
and
put
tadpoles
in
the
and
the
dinner
was
two
hours
late
and
proportionately
bad
because
the
italian
cook
was
posing
for
fulmer
lansing
s
first
thought
had
been
that
meeting
susy
in
such
circumstances
would
be
the
quickest
way
to
cure
them
both
of
their
regrets
the
case
of
the
fulmers
was
an
awful
in
what
happened
to
young
people
who
lost
their
heads
poor
nat
whose
pictures
nobody
bought
had
gone
to
seed
so
terribly
and
grace
at
would
never
again
be
anything
but
the
woman
of
whom
people
say
i
can
remember
her
when
she
was
but
the
devil
of
it
was
that
nat
had
never
been
such
good
company
or
grace
so
free
from
care
and
so
full
of
music
and
that
in
spite
of
their
disorder
and
dishevelment
and
the
bad
food
and
general
crazy
discomfort
there
was
more
amusement
to
be
got
out
of
their
society
than
out
of
the
most
opulently
staged
through
which
susy
and
lansing
had
ever
yawned
their
way
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
the
young
man
when
on
the
second
afternoon
miss
branch
drew
him
into
the
narrow
hall
to
say
i
really
can
t
stand
the
combination
of
grace
s
violin
and
little
nat
s
any
longer
do
let
us
slip
out
till
the
duet
is
how
do
they
stand
it
i
wonder
he
basely
echoed
as
he
followed
her
up
the
wooded
path
behind
the
house
it
might
be
worth
finding
out
she
rejoined
with
a
musing
smile
but
he
remained
resolutely
skeptical
oh
give
them
a
year
or
two
more
and
they
ll
collapse
his
pictures
will
never
sell
you
know
he
ll
never
even
get
them
into
a
i
suppose
not
and
she
ll
never
have
time
to
do
anything
worth
while
with
her
they
had
reached
a
piny
knoll
high
above
the
ledge
on
which
the
house
was
perched
all
about
them
stretched
an
empty
landscape
of
endless
featureless
wooded
hills
think
of
sticking
here
all
the
year
round
lansing
groaned
i
know
but
then
think
of
wandering
over
the
world
with
some
people
oh
lord
yes
for
instance
my
trip
to
india
with
the
mortimer
hickses
but
it
was
my
only
chance
and
what
the
deuce
is
one
to
do
i
wish
i
knew
she
sighed
thinking
of
the
bockheimers
and
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
knew
what
the
answer
to
your
question
what
is
one
to
do
when
one
sees
both
sides
of
the
problem
or
every
possible
side
of
it
indeed
they
had
seated
themselves
on
a
commanding
rock
under
the
pines
but
lansing
could
not
see
the
view
at
their
feet
for
the
stir
of
the
brown
lashes
on
her
cheek
you
mean
nat
and
grace
may
after
all
be
having
the
best
of
it
how
can
i
say
when
i
ve
told
you
i
see
all
the
sides
of
course
susy
added
hastily
i
couldn
t
live
as
they
do
for
a
week
but
it
s
wonderful
how
little
it
s
dimmed
certainly
nat
was
never
more
coruscating
and
she
keeps
it
up
even
he
reflected
we
do
them
good
i
yes
or
they
us
i
wonder
which
after
that
he
seemed
to
remember
that
they
sat
a
long
time
silent
and
that
his
next
utterance
was
a
boyish
outburst
against
the
tyranny
of
the
existing
order
of
things
abruptly
followed
by
the
passionate
query
why
since
he
and
she
couldn
t
alter
it
and
since
they
both
had
the
habit
of
looking
at
facts
as
they
were
they
wouldn
t
be
utter
fools
not
to
take
their
chance
of
being
happy
in
the
only
way
that
was
open
to
them
to
this
challenge
he
did
not
recall
susy
s
making
any
definite
answer
but
after
another
interval
in
which
all
the
world
seemed
framed
in
a
sudden
kiss
he
heard
her
murmur
to
herself
in
a
brooding
tone
i
don
t
suppose
it
s
ever
been
tried
before
but
we
might
and
then
and
there
she
had
laid
before
him
the
very
experiment
they
had
since
hazarded
she
would
have
none
of
surreptitious
bliss
she
began
by
declaring
and
she
set
forth
her
reasons
with
her
usual
lucid
impartiality
in
the
first
place
she
should
have
to
marry
some
day
and
when
she
made
the
bargain
she
meant
it
to
be
an
honest
one
and
secondly
in
the
matter
of
love
she
would
never
give
herself
to
anyone
she
did
not
really
care
for
and
if
such
happiness
ever
came
to
her
she
did
not
want
it
shorn
of
half
its
brightness
by
the
need
of
fibbing
and
plotting
and
dodging
i
ve
seen
too
much
of
that
kind
of
thing
half
the
women
i
know
who
ve
had
lovers
have
had
them
for
the
fun
of
sneaking
and
lying
about
it
but
the
other
half
have
been
miserable
and
i
should
be
it
was
at
this
point
that
she
unfolded
her
plan
why
shouldn
t
they
marry
belong
to
each
other
openly
and
honourably
if
for
ever
so
short
a
time
and
with
the
definite
understanding
that
whenever
either
of
them
got
the
chance
to
do
better
he
or
she
should
be
immediately
released
the
law
of
their
country
facilitated
such
exchanges
and
society
was
beginning
to
view
them
as
indulgently
as
the
law
as
susy
talked
she
warmed
to
her
theme
and
began
to
develop
its
endless
possibilities
we
should
really
in
a
way
help
more
than
we
should
hamper
each
other
she
ardently
explained
we
both
know
the
ropes
so
well
what
one
of
us
didn
t
see
the
other
might
in
the
way
of
opportunities
i
mean
and
then
we
should
be
a
novelty
as
married
people
we
re
both
rather
unusually
popular
why
not
be
frank
and
it
s
such
a
blessing
for
to
be
able
to
count
on
a
couple
of
whom
neither
one
is
a
blank
yes
i
really
believe
we
should
be
more
than
twice
the
success
we
are
now
at
least
she
added
with
a
smile
if
there
s
that
amount
of
room
for
improvement
i
don
t
know
how
you
feel
a
man
s
popularity
is
so
much
less
precarious
than
a
girl
s
but
i
know
it
would
furbish
me
up
tremendously
to
reappear
as
a
married
she
glanced
away
from
him
down
the
long
valley
at
their
feet
and
added
in
a
lower
tone
and
i
should
like
just
for
a
little
while
to
feel
i
had
something
in
life
of
my
very
own
something
that
nobody
had
lent
me
like
a
or
a
motor
or
an
opera
the
suggestion
at
first
had
seemed
to
lansing
as
mad
as
it
was
enchanting
it
had
thoroughly
frightened
him
but
susy
s
arguments
were
irrefutable
her
ingenuities
inexhaustible
had
he
ever
thought
it
all
out
she
asked
no
well
she
had
and
would
he
kindly
not
interrupt
in
the
first
place
there
would
be
all
the
jewels
and
a
motor
and
a
silver
dinner
service
did
she
mean
not
a
bit
of
it
she
could
see
he
d
never
given
the
question
proper
thought
cheques
my
dear
nothing
but
cheques
she
undertook
to
manage
that
on
her
side
she
really
thought
she
could
count
on
about
fifty
and
she
supposed
he
could
rake
up
a
few
more
well
all
that
would
simply
represent
for
they
would
have
plenty
of
houses
to
live
in
he
d
see
people
were
always
glad
to
lend
their
house
to
a
couple
it
was
such
fun
to
pop
down
and
see
them
it
made
one
feel
romantic
and
jolly
all
they
need
do
was
to
accept
the
houses
in
turn
go
on
for
a
year
what
was
he
afraid
of
didn
t
he
think
they
d
be
happy
enough
to
want
to
keep
it
up
and
why
not
at
least
try
get
engaged
and
then
see
what
would
happen
even
if
she
was
all
wrong
and
her
plan
failed
wouldn
t
it
have
been
rather
nice
just
for
a
month
or
two
to
fancy
they
were
going
to
be
happy
i
ve
often
fancied
it
all
by
myself
she
concluded
but
fancying
it
with
you
would
somehow
be
so
awfully
different
that
was
how
it
began
and
this
lakeside
dream
was
what
it
had
led
up
to
fantastically
improbable
as
they
had
seemed
all
her
previsions
had
come
true
if
there
were
certain
links
in
the
chain
that
lansing
had
never
been
able
to
put
his
hand
on
certain
arrangements
and
contrivances
that
still
needed
further
elucidation
why
he
was
lazily
resolved
to
clear
them
up
with
her
some
day
and
meanwhile
it
was
worth
all
the
past
might
have
cost
and
every
penalty
the
future
might
exact
of
him
just
to
be
sitting
here
in
the
silence
and
sweetness
her
sleeping
head
on
his
knee
clasped
in
his
joy
as
the
hushed
world
was
clasped
in
moonlight
he
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
wake
up
he
whispered
it
s
iii
their
month
of
como
was
within
a
few
hours
of
ending
till
the
last
moment
they
had
hoped
for
a
reprieve
but
the
accommodating
streffy
had
been
unable
to
put
the
villa
at
their
disposal
for
a
longer
time
since
he
had
had
the
luck
to
let
it
for
a
thumping
price
to
some
beastly
bouncers
who
insisted
on
taking
possession
at
the
date
agreed
on
lansing
leaving
susy
s
side
at
dawn
had
gone
down
to
the
lake
for
a
last
plunge
and
swimming
homeward
through
the
crystal
light
he
looked
up
at
the
garden
brimming
with
flowers
the
long
low
house
with
the
cypress
wood
above
it
and
the
window
behind
which
his
wife
still
slept
the
month
had
been
exquisite
and
their
happiness
as
rare
as
fantastically
complete
as
the
scene
before
him
he
sank
his
chin
into
the
sunlit
ripples
and
sighed
for
sheer
content
it
was
a
bore
to
be
leaving
the
scene
of
such
complete
but
the
next
stage
in
their
progress
promised
to
be
hardly
less
delightful
susy
was
a
magician
everything
she
predicted
came
true
houses
were
being
showered
on
them
on
all
sides
he
seemed
to
see
beneficent
spirits
winging
toward
them
laden
with
everything
from
a
piano
nobile
in
venice
to
a
camp
in
the
adirondacks
for
the
present
they
had
decided
on
the
former
other
considerations
apart
they
dared
not
risk
the
expense
of
a
journey
across
the
atlantic
so
they
were
heading
instead
for
the
nelson
vanderlyns
palace
on
the
giudecca
they
were
agreed
that
for
reasons
of
expediency
it
might
be
wise
to
return
to
new
york
for
the
coming
winter
it
would
keep
them
in
view
and
probably
lead
to
fresh
opportunities
indeed
susy
already
had
in
mind
the
convenient
flat
that
she
was
sure
a
migratory
cousin
if
tactfully
handled
and
assured
that
they
would
not
overwork
her
cook
could
certainly
be
induced
to
lend
them
meanwhile
the
need
of
making
plans
was
still
remote
and
if
there
was
one
art
in
which
young
lansing
s
years
of
existence
had
perfected
him
it
was
that
of
living
completely
and
unconcernedly
in
the
present
if
of
late
he
had
tried
to
look
into
the
future
more
insistently
than
was
his
habit
it
was
only
because
of
susy
he
had
meant
when
they
married
to
be
as
philosophic
for
her
as
for
himself
and
he
knew
she
would
have
resented
above
everything
his
regarding
their
partnership
as
a
reason
for
anxious
thought
but
since
they
had
been
together
she
had
given
him
glimpses
of
her
past
that
made
him
angrily
long
to
shelter
and
defend
her
future
it
was
intolerable
that
a
spirit
as
fine
as
hers
should
be
ever
so
little
dulled
or
diminished
by
the
kind
of
compromises
out
of
which
their
wretched
lives
were
made
for
himself
he
didn
t
care
a
hang
he
had
composed
for
his
own
guidance
a
code
a
short
set
of
mays
and
mustn
ts
which
immensely
simplified
his
course
there
were
things
a
fellow
put
up
with
for
the
sake
of
certain
definite
and
otherwise
unattainable
advantages
there
were
other
things
he
wouldn
t
traffic
with
at
any
price
but
for
a
woman
he
began
to
see
it
might
be
different
the
temptations
might
be
greater
the
cost
considerably
higher
the
dividing
line
between
the
mays
and
mustn
ts
more
fluctuating
and
less
sharply
drawn
susy
thrown
on
the
world
at
seventeen
with
only
a
weak
wastrel
of
a
father
to
define
that
treacherous
line
for
her
and
with
every
circumstance
soliciting
her
to
overstep
it
seemed
to
have
been
preserved
chiefly
by
an
innate
scorn
of
most
of
the
objects
of
human
folly
such
trash
as
he
went
to
pieces
for
was
her
curt
comment
on
her
parent
s
premature
demise
as
though
she
accepted
in
advance
the
necessity
of
ruining
one
s
self
for
something
but
was
resolved
to
discriminate
firmly
between
what
was
worth
it
and
what
wasn
t
this
philosophy
had
at
first
enchanted
lansing
but
now
it
began
to
rouse
vague
fears
the
fine
armour
of
her
fastidiousness
had
preserved
her
from
the
kind
of
risks
she
had
hitherto
been
exposed
to
but
what
if
others
more
subtle
found
a
joint
in
it
was
there
among
her
delicate
discriminations
any
equivalent
to
his
own
rules
might
not
her
taste
for
the
best
and
rarest
be
the
very
instrument
of
her
undoing
and
if
something
that
wasn
t
trash
came
her
way
would
she
hesitate
a
second
to
go
to
pieces
for
it
he
was
determined
to
stick
to
the
compact
that
they
should
do
nothing
to
interfere
with
what
each
referred
to
as
the
other
s
chance
but
what
if
when
hers
came
he
couldn
t
agree
with
her
in
recognizing
it
he
wanted
for
her
oh
so
passionately
the
best
but
his
conception
of
that
best
had
so
insensibly
so
subtly
been
transformed
in
the
light
of
their
first
month
together
his
lazy
strokes
were
carrying
him
slowly
shoreward
but
the
hour
was
so
exquisite
that
a
few
yards
from
the
landing
he
laid
hold
of
the
mooring
rope
of
streffy
s
boat
and
floated
there
following
his
dream
it
was
a
bore
to
be
leaving
no
doubt
that
was
what
made
him
turn
things
so
uselessly
venice
would
be
delicious
of
course
but
nothing
would
ever
again
be
as
sweet
as
this
and
then
they
had
only
a
year
of
security
before
them
and
of
that
year
a
month
was
gone
reluctantly
he
swam
ashore
walked
up
to
the
house
and
pushed
open
a
window
of
the
cool
painted
signs
of
departure
were
already
visible
there
were
trunks
in
the
hall
tennis
rackets
on
the
stairs
on
the
landing
the
cook
giulietta
had
both
arms
around
a
slippery
that
refused
to
let
itself
be
strapped
it
all
gave
him
a
chill
sense
of
unreality
as
if
the
past
month
had
been
an
act
on
the
stage
and
its
setting
were
being
folded
away
and
rolled
into
the
wings
to
make
room
for
another
play
in
which
he
and
susy
had
no
part
by
the
time
he
came
down
again
dressed
and
hungry
to
the
terrace
where
coffee
awaited
him
he
had
recovered
his
usual
pleasant
sense
of
security
susy
was
there
fresh
and
gay
a
rose
in
her
breast
and
the
sun
in
her
hair
her
head
was
bowed
over
bradshaw
but
she
waved
a
fond
hand
across
the
breakfast
things
and
presently
looked
up
to
say
yes
i
believe
we
can
just
manage
manage
what
to
catch
the
train
at
milan
if
we
start
in
the
motor
at
ten
he
stared
the
motor
what
motor
why
the
new
people
s
streffy
s
tenants
he
s
never
told
me
their
name
and
the
chauffeur
says
he
can
t
pronounce
it
the
chauffeur
s
is
ottaviano
anyhow
i
ve
been
making
friends
with
him
he
arrived
last
night
and
he
says
they
re
not
due
at
como
till
this
evening
he
simply
jumped
at
the
idea
of
running
us
over
to
good
lord
said
lansing
when
she
stopped
she
sprang
up
from
the
table
with
a
laugh
it
will
be
a
scramble
but
i
ll
manage
it
if
you
ll
go
up
at
once
and
pitch
the
last
things
into
your
yes
but
look
here
have
you
any
idea
what
it
s
going
to
cost
she
raised
her
eyebrows
gaily
why
a
good
deal
less
than
our
railway
tickets
ottaviano
s
got
a
sweetheart
in
milan
and
hasn
t
seen
her
for
six
months
when
i
found
that
out
i
knew
he
d
be
going
there
it
was
clever
of
her
and
he
laughed
but
why
was
it
that
he
had
grown
to
shrink
from
even
such
harmless
evidence
of
her
always
knowing
how
to
manage
oh
well
he
said
to
himself
she
s
right
the
fellow
would
be
sure
to
be
going
to
upstairs
on
the
way
to
his
dressing
room
he
found
her
in
a
cloud
of
finery
which
her
skilful
hands
were
forcibly
compressing
into
a
last
portmanteau
he
had
never
seen
anyone
pack
as
cleverly
as
susy
the
way
she
coaxed
reluctant
things
into
a
trunk
was
a
symbol
of
the
way
she
fitted
discordant
facts
into
her
life
when
i
m
rich
she
often
said
the
thing
i
shall
hate
most
will
be
to
see
an
idiot
maid
at
my
as
he
passed
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
her
face
pink
with
the
struggle
and
drew
a
from
the
depths
dearest
do
put
a
couple
of
cigars
into
your
pocket
as
a
tip
for
lansing
stared
why
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
with
streffy
s
cigars
packing
them
of
course
you
don
t
suppose
he
meant
them
for
those
other
people
she
gave
him
a
look
of
honest
wonder
i
don
t
know
whom
he
meant
them
for
but
they
re
not
ours
she
continued
to
look
at
him
wonderingly
i
don
t
see
what
there
is
to
be
solemn
about
the
cigars
are
not
streffy
s
either
you
may
be
sure
he
got
them
out
of
some
bounder
and
there
s
nothing
he
d
hate
more
than
to
have
them
passed
on
to
nonsense
if
they
re
not
streffy
s
they
re
much
less
mine
hand
them
over
please
just
as
you
like
but
it
does
seem
a
waste
and
of
course
the
other
people
will
never
have
one
of
them
the
gardener
and
giulietta
s
lover
will
see
to
that
lansing
looked
away
from
her
at
the
waves
of
lace
and
muslin
from
which
she
emerged
like
a
rosy
nereid
how
many
boxes
of
them
are
left
only
unpack
them
before
she
moved
there
was
a
pause
so
full
of
challenge
that
lansing
had
time
for
an
exasperated
sense
of
the
disproportion
between
his
anger
and
its
cause
and
this
made
him
still
angrier
she
held
out
a
box
the
others
are
in
your
suitcase
downstairs
it
s
locked
and
give
me
the
key
we
might
send
them
back
from
venice
mightn
t
we
that
lock
is
so
nasty
it
will
take
you
half
an
give
me
the
key
she
gave
it
he
went
downstairs
and
battled
with
the
lock
for
the
allotted
under
the
puzzled
eyes
of
giulietta
and
the
sardonic
grin
of
the
chauffeur
who
now
and
then
from
the
threshold
politely
reminded
him
how
long
it
would
take
to
get
to
milan
finally
the
key
turned
and
lansing
and
perspiring
extracted
the
cigars
and
stalked
with
them
into
the
deserted
drawing
room
the
great
bunches
of
golden
roses
that
he
and
susy
had
gathered
the
day
before
were
dropping
their
petals
on
the
marble
embroidery
of
the
floor
pale
camellias
floated
in
the
alabaster
tazzas
between
the
windows
haunting
scents
of
the
garden
blew
in
on
him
with
the
breeze
from
the
lake
never
had
streffy
s
little
house
seemed
so
like
a
nest
of
pleasures
lansing
laid
the
cigar
boxes
on
a
console
and
ran
upstairs
to
collect
his
last
possessions
when
he
came
down
again
his
wife
her
eyes
brilliant
with
achievement
was
seated
in
their
borrowed
chariot
the
luggage
cleverly
stowed
away
and
giulietta
and
the
gardener
kissing
her
hand
and
weeping
out
inconsolable
farewells
i
wonder
what
she
s
given
them
he
thought
as
he
jumped
in
beside
her
and
the
motor
whirled
them
through
the
to
the
gate
iv
charlie
strefford
s
villa
was
like
a
nest
in
a
the
nelson
vanderlyns
palace
called
for
loftier
analogies
its
vastness
and
splendour
seemed
in
comparison
oppressive
to
susy
their
landing
after
dark
at
the
foot
of
the
great
shadowy
staircase
their
dinner
at
a
table
under
a
ceiling
weighed
down
with
olympians
their
chilly
evening
in
a
corner
of
a
drawing
room
where
minuets
should
have
been
danced
before
a
throne
contrasted
with
the
happy
intimacies
of
como
as
their
sudden
sense
of
disaccord
contrasted
with
the
mutual
confidence
of
the
day
before
the
journey
had
been
particularly
jolly
both
susy
and
lansing
had
had
too
long
a
discipline
in
the
art
of
smoothing
things
over
not
to
make
a
special
effort
to
hide
from
each
other
the
ravages
of
their
first
disagreement
but
deep
down
and
invisible
the
disagreement
remained
and
compunction
for
having
been
its
cause
gnawed
at
susy
s
bosom
as
she
sat
in
her
tapestried
and
vaulted
bedroom
brushing
her
hair
before
a
tarnished
mirror
i
thought
i
liked
grandeur
but
this
place
is
really
out
of
scale
she
mused
watching
the
reflection
of
a
pale
hand
move
back
and
forward
in
the
dim
recesses
of
the
mirror
and
yet
she
continued
ellie
vanderlyn
s
hardly
half
an
inch
taller
than
i
am
and
she
certainly
isn
t
a
bit
more
dignified
i
wonder
if
it
s
because
i
feel
so
horribly
small
that
the
place
seems
so
horribly
she
loved
luxury
splendid
things
always
made
her
feel
handsome
and
high
ceilings
arrogant
she
did
not
remember
having
ever
before
been
oppressed
by
the
evidences
of
wealth
she
laid
down
the
brush
and
leaned
her
chin
on
her
clasped
hands
even
now
she
could
not
understand
what
had
made
her
take
the
cigars
she
had
always
been
alive
to
the
value
of
her
inherited
scruples
her
reasoned
opinions
were
unusually
free
but
with
regard
to
the
things
one
couldn
t
reason
about
she
was
oddly
tenacious
and
yet
she
had
taken
streffy
s
cigars
she
had
taken
them
yes
that
was
the
point
she
had
taken
them
for
nick
because
the
desire
to
please
him
to
make
the
smallest
details
of
his
life
easy
and
agreeable
and
luxurious
had
become
her
absorbing
preoccupation
she
had
committed
for
him
precisely
the
kind
of
little
baseness
she
would
most
have
scorned
to
commit
for
herself
and
since
he
hadn
t
instantly
felt
the
difference
she
would
never
be
able
to
explain
it
to
him
she
stood
up
with
a
sigh
shook
out
her
loosened
hair
and
glanced
around
the
great
frescoed
room
the
had
said
something
about
the
signora
s
having
left
a
letter
for
her
and
there
it
lay
on
the
with
her
mail
and
nick
s
a
thick
envelope
addressed
in
ellie
s
childish
scrawl
with
a
glaring
private
dashed
across
the
corner
what
on
earth
can
she
have
to
say
when
she
hates
writing
so
susy
mused
she
broke
open
the
envelope
and
four
or
five
stamped
and
sealed
letters
fell
from
it
all
were
addressed
in
ellie
s
hand
to
nelson
vanderlyn
esqre
and
in
the
corner
of
each
was
faintly
pencilled
a
number
and
a
date
one
two
three
four
with
a
week
s
interval
between
the
dates
goodness
gasped
susy
understanding
she
had
dropped
into
an
armchair
near
the
table
and
for
a
long
time
she
sat
staring
at
the
numbered
letters
a
sheet
of
paper
covered
with
ellie
s
writing
had
fluttered
out
among
them
but
she
let
it
lie
she
knew
so
well
what
it
would
say
she
knew
all
about
her
friend
of
course
except
poor
old
nelson
who
didn
t
but
she
had
never
imagined
that
ellie
would
dare
to
use
her
in
this
way
it
was
unbelievable
she
had
never
pictured
anything
so
vile
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
and
she
sprang
up
angrily
half
minded
to
tear
the
letters
in
bits
and
throw
them
all
into
the
fire
she
heard
her
husband
s
knock
on
the
door
between
their
rooms
and
swept
the
dangerous
packet
under
the
oh
go
away
please
there
s
a
dear
she
called
out
i
haven
t
finished
unpacking
and
everything
s
in
such
a
gathering
up
nick
s
papers
and
letters
she
ran
across
the
room
and
thrust
them
through
the
door
here
s
something
to
keep
you
quiet
she
laughed
shining
in
on
him
an
instant
from
the
threshold
she
turned
back
feeling
weak
with
shame
ellie
s
letter
lay
on
the
floor
reluctantly
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
and
one
by
one
the
expected
phrases
sprang
out
at
her
one
good
turn
deserves
another
of
course
you
and
nick
are
welcome
to
stay
all
summer
there
won
t
be
a
particle
of
expense
for
you
the
servants
have
orders
if
you
ll
just
be
an
angel
and
post
these
letters
yourself
it
s
been
my
only
chance
for
such
an
age
when
we
meet
i
ll
explain
everything
and
in
a
month
at
latest
i
ll
be
back
to
fetch
clarissa
susy
lifted
the
letter
to
the
lamp
to
be
sure
she
had
read
aright
to
fetch
clarissa
then
ellie
s
child
was
here
here
under
the
roof
with
them
left
to
their
care
she
read
on
raging
she
s
so
delighted
poor
darling
to
know
you
re
coming
i
ve
had
to
sack
her
beastly
governess
for
impertinence
and
if
it
weren
t
for
you
she
d
be
all
alone
with
a
lot
of
servants
i
don
t
much
trust
so
for
pity
s
sake

good
to
my
child
and
forgive
me
for
leaving
her
she
thinks
i
ve
gone
to
take
a
cure
and
she
knows
she
s
not
to
tell
her
daddy
that
i
m
away
because
it
would
only
worry
him
if
he
thought
i
was
she
s
perfectly
to
be
trusted
you
ll
see
what
a
clever
angel
she
is
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
in
a
last
slanting
postscript
susy
darling
if
you
ve
ever
owed
me
anything
in
the
way
of
kindness
you
won
t
on
your
sacred
honour
say
a
word
of
this
to
any
one
even
to
nick
and
i
know
i
can
count
on
you
to
rub
out
the
susy
sprang
up
and
tossed
vanderlyn
s
letter
into
the
fire
then
she
came
slowly
back
to
the
chair
there
at
her
elbow
lay
the
four
fatal
envelopes
and
her
next
affair
was
to
make
up
her
mind
what
to
do
with
them
to
destroy
them
on
the
spot
had
seemed
at
first
thought
inevitable
it
might
be
saving
ellie
as
well
as
herself
but
such
a
step
seemed
to
susy
to
involve
departure
on
the
morrow
and
this
in
turn
involved
notifying
ellie
whose
letter
she
had
vainly
scanned
for
an
address
well
perhaps
clarissa
s
nurse
would
know
where
one
could
write
to
her
mother
it
was
unlikely
that
even
ellie
would
go
off
without
assuring
some
means
of
communication
with
her
child
at
any
rate
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
that
night
nothing
but
to
work
out
the
details
of
their
flight
on
the
morrow
and
rack
her
brains
to
find
a
substitute
for
the
hospitality
they
were
rejecting
susy
did
not
disguise
from
herself
how
much
she
had
counted
on
the
vanderlyn
apartment
for
the
summer
to
be
able
to
do
so
had
singularly
simplified
the
future
she
knew
ellie
s
largeness
of
hand
and
had
been
sure
in
advance
that
as
long
as
they
were
her
guests
their
only
expense
would
be
an
occasional
present
to
the
servants
and
what
would
the
alternative
be
she
and
lansing
in
their
endless
talks
had
so
lived
themselves
into
the
vision
of
indolent
summer
days
on
the
lagoon
of
flaming
hours
on
the
beach
of
the
lido
and
evenings
of
music
and
dreams
on
their
broad
balcony
above
the
giudecca
that
the
idea
of
having
to
renounce
these
joys
and
deprive
her
nick
of
them
filled
susy
with
a
wrath
intensified
by
his
having
confided
in
her
that
when
they
were
quietly
settled
in
venice
he
meant
to
already
nascent
in
her
breast
was
the
fierce
resolve
of
the
author
s
wife
to
defend
her
husband
s
privacy
and
facilitate
his
encounters
with
the
muse
it
was
abominable
simply
abominable
that
ellie
vanderlyn
should
have
drawn
her
into
such
a
trap
well
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
thing
to
nick
the
trivial
incident
of
the
cigars
how
trivial
it
now
seemed
showed
her
the
kind
of
stand
he
would
take
and
communicated
to
her
something
of
his
own
uncompromising
energy
she
would
tell
him
the
whole
story
in
the
morning
and
try
to
find
a
way
out
with
him
susy
s
faith
in
her
power
of
finding
a
way
out
was
inexhaustible
but
suddenly
she
remembered
the
adjuration
at
the
end
of
vanderlyn
s
letter
if
you
re
ever
owed
me
anything
in
the
way
of
kindness
you
won
t
on
your
sacred
honour
say
a
word
to
nick
it
was
of
course
exactly
what
no
one
had
the
right
to
ask
of
her
if
indeed
the
word
right
could
be
used
in
any
conceivable
relation
to
this
coil
of
wrongs
but
the
fact
remained
that
in
the
way
of
kindness
she
did
owe
much
to
ellie
and
that
this
was
the
first
payment
her
friend
had
ever
exacted
she
found
herself
in
fact
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
when
ursula
gillow
using
the
same
argument
had
appealed
to
her
to
give
up
nick
lansing
yes
susy
reflected
but
then
nelson
vanderlyn
had
been
kind
to
her
too
and
the
money
ellie
had
been
so
kind
with
was
nelson
s
the
queer
edifice
of
susy
s
standards
tottered
on
its
base
she
honestly
didn
t
know
where
fairness
lay
as
between
so
much
that
was
foul
the
very
depth
of
her
perplexity
puzzled
her
she
had
been
in
tight
places
before
had
indeed
been
in
so
few
that
were
not
in
one
way
or
another
constricting
as
she
looked
back
on
her
past
it
lay
before
her
as
a
very
network
of
perpetual
concessions
and
contrivings
but
never
before
had
she
had
such
a
sense
of
being
tripped
up
gagged
and
pinioned
the
little
misery
of
the
cigars
still
galled
her
and
now
this
big
humiliation
superposed
itself
on
the
raw
wound
decidedly
the
second
month
of
their
was
beginning
cloudily
she
glanced
at
the
enamel
led
on
her
dressing
table
one
of
the
few
she
had
consented
to
accept
in
kind
and
was
startled
at
the
lateness
of
the
hour
in
a
moment
nick
would
be
coming
and
an
uncomfortable
sensation
in
her
throat
warned
her
that
through
sheer
nervousness
and
exasperation
she
might
blurt
out
something
the
old
habit
of
being
always
on
her
guard
made
her
turn
once
more
to
the
her
face
was
pale
and
haggard
and
having
by
a
swift
and
skilful
application
of
cosmetics
increased
its
appearance
of
fatigue
she
crossed
the
room
and
softly
opened
her
husband
s
door
he
too
sat
by
a
lamp
reading
a
letter
which
he
put
aside
as
she
entered
his
face
was
grave
and
she
said
to
herself
that
he
was
certainly
still
thinking
about
the
cigars
i
m
very
tired
dearest
and
my
head
aches
so
horribly
that
i
ve
come
to
bid
you
bending
over
the
back
of
his
chair
she
laid
her
arms
on
his
shoulders
he
lifted
his
hands
to
clasp
hers
but
as
he
threw
his
head
back
to
smile
up
at
her
she
noticed
that
his
look
was
still
serious
almost
remote
it
was
as
if
for
the
first
time
a
faint
veil
hung
between
his
eyes
and
hers
i
m
so
sorry
it
s
been
a
long
day
for
you
he
said
absently
pressing
his
lips
to
her
hands
she
felt
the
dreaded
twitch
in
her
throat
nick
she
burst
out
tightening
her
embrace
before
i
go
you
ve
got
to
swear
to
me
on
your
honour
that
you
know
i
should
never
have
taken
those
cigars
for
myself
for
a
moment
he
stared
at
her
and
she
stared
back
at
him
with
equal
gravity
then
the
same
irresistible
mirth
welled
up
in
both
and
susy
s
compunctions
were
swept
away
on
a
gale
of
laughter
when
she
woke
the
next
morning
the
sun
was
pouring
in
between
her
curtains
of
old
brocade
and
its
refraction
from
the
ripples
of
the
canal
was
drawing
a
network
of
golden
scales
across
the
vaulted
ceiling
the
maid
had
just
placed
a
tray
on
a
slim
marquetry
table
near
the
bed
and
over
the
edge
of
the
tray
susy
discovered
the
small
serious
face
of
clarissa
vanderlyn
at
the
sight
of
the
little
girl
all
her
dormant
qualms
awoke
clarissa
was
just
eight
and
small
for
her
age
her
little
round
chin
was
barely
on
a
level
with
the
and
her
clear
brown
eyes
gazed
at
susy
between
the
ribs
of
the
and
the
single
in
an
old
murano
glass
susy
had
not
seen
her
for
two
years
and
she
seemed
in
the
interval
to
have
passed
from
a
thoughtful
infancy
to
complete
ripeness
of
feminine
experience
she
was
looking
with
approval
at
her
mother
s
guest
i
m
so
glad
you
ve
come
she
said
in
a
small
sweet
voice
i
like
you
so
very
much
i
know
i
m
not
to
be
often
with
you
but
at
least
you
ll
have
an
eye
on
me
won
t
you
an
eye
on
you
i
shall
never
want
to
have
it
off
you
if
you
say
such
nice
things
to
me
susy
laughed
leaning
from
her
pillows
to
draw
the
little
girl
up
to
her
side
clarissa
smiled
and
settled
herself
down
comfortably
on
the
silken
bedspread
oh
i
know
i
m
not
to
be
always
about
because
you
re
just
married
but
could
you
see
to
it
that
i
have
my
meals
regularly
why
you
poor
darling
don
t
you
always
not
when
mother
s
away
on
these
cures
the
servants
don
t
always
obey
me
you
see
i
m
so
little
for
my
age
in
a
few
years
of
course
they
ll
have
to
even
if
i
don
t
grow
much
she
added
judiciously
she
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
the
string
of
pearls
about
susy
s
throat
they
re
small
but
they
re
very
good
i
suppose
you
don
t
take
the
others
when
you
travel
the
others
bless
you
i
haven
t
any
others
and
never
shall
have
no
other
pearls
no
other
jewels
at
clarissa
stared
is
that
really
true
she
asked
as
if
in
the
presence
of
the
unprecedented
awfully
true
susy
confessed
but
i
think
i
can
make
the
servants
obey
me
all
the
this
point
seemed
to
have
lost
its
interest
for
clarissa
who
was
still
gravely
scrutinizing
her
companion
after
a
while
she
brought
forth
another
question
did
you
have
to
give
up
all
your
jewels
when
you
were
divorced
divorced
susy
threw
her
head
back
against
the
pillows
and
laughed
why
what
are
you
thinking
of
don
t
you
remember
that
i
wasn
t
even
married
the
last
time
you
saw
me
yes
i
do
but
that
was
two
years
the
little
girl
wound
her
arms
about
susy
s
neck
and
leaned
against
her
caressingly
are
you
going
to
be
soon
then
i
ll
promise
not
to
tell
if
you
don
t
want
me
going
to
be
divorced
of
course
not
what
in
the
world
made
you
think
so
because
you
look
so
awfully
happy
said
clarissa
vanderlyn
simply
it
was
a
trifling
enough
sign
but
it
had
remained
in
susy
s
mind
that
first
morning
in
venice
nick
had
gone
out
without
first
coming
in
to
see
her
she
had
stayed
in
bed
late
chatting
with
clarissa
and
expecting
to
see
the
door
open
and
her
husband
appear
and
when
the
child
left
and
she
had
jumped
up
and
looked
into
nick
s
room
she
found
it
empty
and
a
line
on
his
dressing
table
informed
her
that
he
had
gone
out
to
send
a
telegram
it
was
and
even
boyish
of
him
to
think
it
necessary
to
explain
his
absence
but
why
had
he
not
simply
come
in
and
told
her
she
instinctively
connected
the
little
fact
with
the
shade
of
preoccupation
she
had
noticed
on
his
face
the
night
before
when
she
had
gone
to
his
room
and
found
him
absorbed
in
letter
and
while
she
dressed
she
had
continued
to
wonder
what
was
in
the
letter
and
whether
the
telegram
he
had
hurried
out
to
send
was
an
answer
to
it
she
had
never
found
out
when
he
reappeared
handsome
and
happy
as
the
morning
he
proffered
no
explanation
and
it
was
part
of
her
policy
not
to
put
questions
it
was
not
only
that
her
jealous
regard
for
her
own
freedom
was
matched
by
an
equal
respect
for
that
of
others
she
had
steered
too
long
among
the
social
reefs
and
shoals
not
to
know
how
narrow
is
the
passage
that
leads
to
peace
of
mind
and
she
was
determined
to
keep
her
little
craft
in
but
the
incident
had
lodged
itself
in
her
memory
acquiring
a
sort
of
symbolic
significance
as
of
a
in
her
relations
with
her
husband
not
that
these
were
less
happy
but
that
she
now
beheld
them
as
she
had
always
formerly
beheld
such
joys
as
an
unstable
islet
in
a
sea
of
storms
her
present
bliss
was
as
complete
as
ever
but
it
was
ringed
by
the
perpetual
menace
of
all
she
knew
she
was
hiding
from
nick
and
of
all
she
suspected
him
of
hiding
from
her
she
was
thinking
of
these
things
one
afternoon
about
three
weeks
after
their
arrival
in
venice
it
was
near
sunset
and
she
sat
alone
on
the
balcony
watching
the
on
the
water
weave
their
pattern
above
the
flushed
reflection
of
old
she
was
almost
always
alone
at
that
hour
nick
had
taken
to
writing
in
the
afternoons
he
had
been
as
good
as
his
word
and
so
apparently
had
the
muse
and
it
was
his
habit
to
join
his
wife
only
at
sunset
for
a
late
row
on
the
lagoon
she
had
taken
clarissa
as
usual
to
the
giardino
pubblico
where
that
obliging
child
had
politely
but
indifferently
played
clarissa
joined
in
the
diversions
of
her
age
as
if
conforming
to
an
obsolete
tradition
and
had
brought
her
back
for
a
music
lesson
echoes
of
which
now
drifted
down
from
a
distant
window
susy
had
come
to
be
extremely
thankful
for
clarissa
but
for
the
little
girl
her
pride
in
her
husband
s
industry
might
have
been
tinged
with
a
faint
sense
of
being
at
times
left
out
and
forgotten
and
as
nick
s
industry
was
the
completest
justification
for
their
being
where
they
were
and
for
her
having
done
what
she
had
she
was
grateful
to
clarissa
for
helping
her
to
feel
less
alone
clarissa
indeed
represented
the
other
half
of
her
justification
it
was
as
much
on
the
child
s
account
as
on
nick
s
that
susy
had
held
her
tongue
remained
in
venice
and
slipped
out
once
a
week
to
post
one
of
ellie
s
numbered
letters
a
day
s
experience
of
the
palazzo
vanderlyn
had
convinced
susy
of
the
impossibility
of
deserting
clarissa
long
experience
had
shown
her
that
the
most
crowded
households
often
contain
the
loneliest
nurseries
and
that
the
rich
child
is
exposed
to
evils
unknown
to
less
pampered
infancy
but
hitherto
such
things
had
merely
been
to
her
one
of
the
uglier
bits
in
the
big
muddled
pattern
of
life
now
she
found
herself
feeling
where
before
she
had
only
judged
her
precarious
bliss
came
to
her
charged
with
a
new
weight
of
pity
she
was
thinking
of
these
things
and
of
the
approaching
date
of
ellie
vanderlyn
s
return
and
of
the
searching
truths
she
was
storing
up
for
that
lady
s
private
ear
when
she
noticed
a
gondola
turning
its
prow
toward
the
steps
below
the
balcony
she
leaned
over
and
a
tall
gentleman
in
shabby
clothes
glancing
up
at
her
as
he
jumped
out
waved
a
mouldy
panama
in
joyful
greeting
streffy
she
exclaimed
as
joyfully
and
she
was
down
the
stairs
when
he
ran
up
them
followed
by
his
boatman
it
s
all
right
i
suppose
ellie
said
i
might
come
he
explained
in
a
shrill
cheerful
voice
and
i
m
to
have
my
same
green
room
with
the
because
its
furniture
is
already
so
frightfully
stained
with
my
susy
was
beaming
on
him
with
the
deep
sense
of
satisfaction
which
his
presence
always
produced
in
his
friends
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
they
all
agreed
half
as
ugly
and
untidy
and
delightful
as
streffy
no
one
who
combined
such
outspoken
selfishness
with
such
imperturbable
good
humour
no
one
who
knew
so
well
how
to
make
you
believe
he
was
being
charming
to
you
when
it
was
you
who
were
being
charming
to
him
in
addition
to
these
seductions
of
which
none
estimated
the
value
more
accurately
than
their
possessor
strefford
had
for
susy
another
attraction
of
which
he
was
probably
unconscious
it
was
that
of
being
the
one
rooted
and
stable
being
among
the
fluid
and
shifting
figures
that
composed
her
world
susy
had
always
lived
among
people
so
denationalized
that
those
one
took
for
russians
generally
turned
out
to
be
american
and
those
one
was
inclined
to
ascribe
to
new
york
proved
to
have
originated
in
rome
or
bucharest
these
cosmopolitan
people
who
in
countries
not
their
own
lived
in
houses
as
big
as
hotels
or
in
hotels
where
the
guests
were
as
international
as
the
waiters
had
and
each
other
over
the
whole
face
of
europe
and
according
to
every
code
that
attempts
to
regulate
human
ties
strefford
too
had
his
home
in
this
world
but
only
one
of
his
homes
the
other
the
one
he
spoke
of
and
probably
thought
of
least
often
was
a
great
dull
english
in
a
northern
county
where
a
life
as
monotonous
and
as
his
own
was
chequered
and
dispersed
had
gone
on
for
generation
after
generation
and
it
was
the
sense
of
that
house
and
of
all
it
typified
even
to
his
vagrancy
and
irreverence
which
coming
out
now
and
then
in
his
talk
or
in
his
attitude
toward
something
or
somebody
gave
him
a
firmer
outline
and
a
steadier
footing
than
the
other
marionettes
in
the
dance
superficially
so
like
them
all
and
so
eager
to
outdo
them
in
detachment
and
adaptability
ridiculing
the
prejudices
he
had
shaken
off
and
the
people
to
whom
he
belonged
he
still
kept
under
his
easy
pliancy
the
skeleton
of
old
faiths
and
old
fashions
he
talks
every
language
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
susy
had
once
said
of
him
but
at
least
he
talks
one
language
better
than
the
others
and
strefford
told
of
the
remark
had
laughed
called
her
an
idiot
and
been
pleased
as
he
shambled
up
the
stairs
with
her
arm
in
arm
she
was
thinking
of
this
quality
with
a
new
appreciation
of
its
value
even
she
and
lansing
in
spite
of
their
unmixed
americanism
their
substantial
background
of
cousinships
in
new
york
and
philadelphia
were
as
mentally
detached
as
universally
at
home
as
touts
at
an
international
exhibition
if
they
were
usually
recognized
as
americans
it
was
only
because
they
spoke
french
so
well
and
because
nick
was
too
fair
to
be
foreign
and
too
to
be
english
but
charlie
strefford
was
english
with
all
the
strength
of
an
inveterate
habit
and
something
in
susy
was
slowly
waking
to
a
sense
of
the
beauty
of
habit
lounging
on
the
balcony
whither
he
had
followed
her
without
pausing
to
remove
the
stains
of
travel
strefford
showed
himself
immensely
interested
in
the
last
chapter
of
her
history
greatly
pleased
at
its
having
been
enacted
under
his
roof
and
hugely
and
flippantly
amused
at
the
firmness
with
which
she
refused
to
let
him
see
nick
till
the
latter
s
daily
task
was
over
writing
rot
what
s
he
writing
he
s
breaking
you
in
my
dear
that
s
what
he
s
doing
establishing
an
alibi
what
ll
you
bet
he
s
just
sitting
there
smoking
and
reading
le
rire
let
s
go
and
but
susy
was
firm
he
s
read
me
his
first
chapter
it
s
wonderful
it
s
a
philosophic
romance
rather
like
marius
you
oh
yes
i
do
said
strefford
with
a
laugh
that
she
thought
idiotic
she
flushed
up
like
a
child
you
re
stupid
streffy
you
forget
that
nick
and
i
don
t
need
alibis
we
ve
got
rid
of
all
that
hyprocrisy
by
agreeing
that
each
will
give
the
other
a
hand
up
when
either
of
us
wants
a
change
we
ve
not
married
to
spy
and
lie
and
nag
each
other
we
ve
formed
a
partnership
for
our
mutual
i
see
that
s
capital
but
how
can
you
be
sure
that
when
nick
wants
a
change
you
ll
consider
it
for
his
advantage
to
have
one
it
was
the
point
that
had
always
secretly
tormented
susy
she
often
wondered
if
it
equally
tormented
nick
i
hope
i
shall
have
enough
common
sense
she
began
oh
of
course
common
sense
is
what
you
re
both
bound
to
base
your
argument
on
whichever
way
you
this
flash
of
insight
disconcerted
her
and
she
said
a
little
irritably
what
should
you
do
then
if
you
married
hush
streffy
i
forbid
you
to
shout
like
that
all
the
gondolas
are
stopping
to
look
how
can
i
help
it
he
rocked
backward
and
forward
in
his
chair
if
you
marry
she
says
streffy
what
have
you
decided
to
do
if
you
suddenly
become
a
raving
maniac
i
said
no
such
thing
if
your
uncle
and
your
cousin
died
you
d
marry
you
know
you
oh
now
you
re
talking
he
folded
his
long
arms
and
leaned
over
the
balcony
looking
down
at
the
dusky
ripples
streaked
with
fire
in
that
case
i
should
say
susan
my
dear
susan
now
that
by
the
merciful
intervention
of
providence
you
have
become
countess
of
altringham
in
the
peerage
of
great
britain
and
baroness
dunsterville
and
d
amblay
in
the
peerages
of
ireland
and
scotland
i
ll
thank
you
to
remember
that
you
are
a
member
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
houses
in
the
united
kingdom
and
not
to
get
found
susy
laughed
we
know
what
those
warnings
mean
i
pity
my
he
swung
about
and
gave
her
a
quick
look
out
of
his
small
ugly
twinkling
eyes
is
there
any
other
woman
in
the
world
named
susan
i
hope
so
if
the
name
s
an
essential
even
if
nick
chucks
me
don
t
count
on
me
to
carry
out
that
programme
i
ve
seen
it
in
practice
too
oh
well
as
far
as
i
know
everybody
s
in
perfect
health
at
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
a
fountain
pen
a
handkerchief
over
which
it
had
leaked
and
a
packet
of
dishevelled
cigarettes
lighting
one
and
restoring
the
other
objects
to
his
pocket
he
continued
calmly
tell
me
how
did
you
manage
to
smooth
things
over
with
the
gillows
ursula
was
running
amuck
when
i
was
in
newport
last
summer
it
was
just
when
people
were
beginning
to
say
that
you
were
going
to
marry
nick
i
was
afraid
she
d
put
a
spoke
in
your
wheel
and
i
hear
she
put
a
big
cheque
in
your
hand
susy
was
silent
from
the
first
moment
of
strefford
s
appearance
she
had
known
that
in
the
course
of
time
he
would
put
that
question
he
was
as
inquisitive
as
a
monkey
and
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
find
out
anything
it
was
useless
to
try
to
divert
his
attention
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
she
said
i
flirted
with
fred
it
was
a
bore
but
he
was
very
he
would
be
poor
fred
and
you
got
ursula
thoroughly
frightened
well
enough
and
then
luckily
that
young
nerone
altineri
turned
up
from
rome
he
went
over
to
new
york
to
look
for
a
job
as
an
engineer
and
ursula
made
fred
put
him
in
their
iron
she
paused
again
and
then
added
abruptly
streffy
if
you
knew
how
i
hate
that
kind
of
thing
i
d
rather
have
nick
come
in
now
and
tell
me
frankly
as
i
know
he
would
that
he
s
going
off
with
with
coral
hicks
strefford
suggested
she
laughed
poor
coral
hicks
what
on
earth
made
you
think
of
the
hickses
because
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
them
the
other
day
at
capri
they
re
cruising
about
they
said
they
were
coming
in
what
a
nuisance
i
do
hope
they
won
t
find
us
out
they
were
awfully
kind
to
nick
when
he
went
to
india
with
them
and
they
re
so
that
they
would
expect
him
to
be
glad
to
see
strefford
aimed
his
at
a
tourist
on
a
puggaree
who
was
gazing
up
from
his
guidebook
at
the
palace
ah
he
murmured
with
satisfaction
seeing
the
shot
take
effect
then
he
added
coral
hicks
is
growing
up
rather
oh
streff
you
re
dreaming
that
lump
of
a
girl
with
spectacles
and
thick
ankles
poor
hicks
used
to
say
to
nick
when
hicks
and
i
had
coral
educated
we
presumed
culture
was
in
greater
demand
in
europe
than
it
appears
to
well
you
ll
see
that
girl
s
education
won
t
interfere
with
her
once
she
s
started
so
then
if
nick
came
in
and
told
you
he
was
going
off
i
should
be
so
thankful
if
it
was
with
a
fright
like
coral
but
you
know
she
added
with
a
smile
we
ve
agreed
that
it
s
not
to
happen
for
a
vi
susy
found
strefford
after
his
first
burst
of
nonsense
unusually
kind
and
responsive
the
interest
he
showed
in
her
future
and
nick
s
seemed
to
proceed
not
so
much
from
his
habitual
spirit
of
scientific
curiosity
as
from
simple
friendliness
he
was
privileged
to
see
nick
s
first
chapter
of
which
he
formed
so
favourable
an
impression
that
he
spoke
sternly
to
susy
on
the
importance
of
respecting
her
husband
s
working
hours
and
he
even
carried
his
general
benevolence
to
the
length
of
showing
a
fatherly
interest
in
clarissa
vanderlyn
he
was
always
charming
to
children
but
fitfully
and
warily
with
an
eye
on
his
independence
and
on
the
possibility
of
being
suddenly
bored
by
them
susy
had
never
seen
him
abandon
these
precautions
so
completely
as
he
did
with
clarissa
poor
little
devil
who
looks
after
her
when
you
and
nick
are
off
together
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
ellie
sacked
the
governess
and
went
away
without
having
anyone
to
take
her
place
i
think
she
expected
me
to
do
it
said
susy
with
a
touch
of
asperity
there
were
moments
when
her
duty
to
clarissa
weighed
on
her
somewhat
heavily
whenever
she
went
off
alone
with
nick
she
was
pursued
by
the
vision
of
a
little
figure
waving
wistful
farewells
from
the
balcony
ah
that
s
like
ellie
you
might
have
known
she
d
get
an
equivalent
when
she
lent
you
all
this
but
i
don
t
believe
she
thought
you
d
be
so
conscientious
about
susy
considered
i
don
t
suppose
she
did
and
perhaps
i
shouldn
t
have
been
a
year
ago
but
you
see
she
hesitated
nick
s
so
awfully
good
it
s
made
me
look
at
a
lot
of
things
differently
oh
hang
nick
s
goodness
it
s
happiness
that
s
done
it
my
dear
you
re
just
one
of
the
people
with
whom
it
happens
to
susy
leaning
back
scrutinized
between
her
lashes
his
crooked
ironic
face
what
is
it
that
s
agreeing
with
you
streffy
i
ve
never
seen
you
so
human
you
must
be
getting
an
outrageous
price
for
the
strefford
laughed
and
clapped
his
hand
on
his
i
should
be
an
ass
not
to
i
ve
got
a
wire
here
saying
they
must
have
it
for
another
month
at
any
what
luck
i
m
so
glad
who
are
they
by
the
way
he
drew
himself
up
out
of
the
long
chair
in
which
he
was
disjointedly
lounging
and
looked
down
at
her
with
a
smile
another
couple
of
idiots
like
you
and
nick
i
say
before
i
spend
it
all
let
s
go
out
and
buy
something
ripping
for
the
days
passed
so
quickly
and
radiantly
that
but
for
her
concern
for
clarissa
susy
would
hardly
have
been
conscious
of
her
hostess
s
protracted
absence
vanderlyn
had
said
four
weeks
at
the
latest
and
the
four
weeks
were
over
and
she
had
neither
arrived
nor
written
to
explain
her
she
had
in
fact
given
no
sign
of
life
since
her
departure
save
in
the
shape
of
a
which
had
reached
clarissa
the
day
after
the
lansings
arrival
and
in
which
vanderlyn
instructed
her
child
to
be
awfully
good
and
not
to
forget
to
feed
the
mongoose
susy
noticed
that
this
missive
had
been
posted
in
milan
she
communicated
her
apprehensions
to
strefford
i
don
t
trust
that
nurse
she
s
forever
with
the
younger
gondolier
and
clarissa
s
so
awfully
sharp
i
don
t
see
why
ellie
hasn
t
come
she
was
due
last
her
companion
laughed
and
something
in
the
sound
of
his
laugh
suggested
that
he
probably
knew
as
much
of
ellie
s
movements
as
she
did
if
not
more
the
sense
of
disgust
which
the
subject
always
roused
in
her
made
her
look
away
quickly
from
his
tolerant
smile
she
would
have
given
the
world
at
that
moment
to
have
been
free
to
tell
nick
what
she
had
learned
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
and
then
to
have
gone
away
with
him
no
matter
where
but
there
was
clarissa
to
fortify
herself
against
the
temptation
she
resolutely
fixed
her
thoughts
on
her
husband
of
nick
s
beatitude
there
could
be
no
doubt
he
adored
her
he
revelled
in
venice
he
rejoiced
in
his
work
and
concerning
the
quality
of
that
work
her
judgment
was
as
confident
as
her
heart
she
still
doubted
if
he
would
ever
earn
a
living
by
what
he
wrote
but
she
no
longer
doubted
that
he
would
write
something
remarkable
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
engaged
on
a
philosophic
romance
and
not
a
mere
novel
seemed
the
proof
of
an
intrinsic
superiority
and
if
she
had
mistrusted
her
impartiality
strefford
s
approval
would
have
reassured
her
among
their
friends
strefford
passed
as
an
authority
on
such
matters
in
summing
him
up
his
eulogists
always
added
and
you
know
he
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
paying
public
had
remained
cold
to
his
few
published
pages
but
he
lived
among
the
kind
of
people
who
confuse
taste
with
talent
and
are
impressed
by
the
most
artless
attempts
at
literary
expression
and
though
he
affected
to
disdain
their
judgment
and
his
own
efforts
susy
knew
he
was
not
sorry
to
have
it
said
of
him
oh
if
only
streffy
had
chosen
strefford
s
approval
of
the
philosophic
romance
convinced
her
that
it
had
been
worth
while
staying
in
venice
for
nick
s
sake
and
if
only
ellie
would
come
back
and
carry
off
clarissa
to
moritz
or
deauville
the
disagreeable
episode
on
which
their
happiness
was
based
would
vanish
like
a
cloud
and
leave
them
to
complete
enjoyment
ellie
did
not
come
but
the
mortimer
hickses
did
and
nick
lansing
was
assailed
by
the
scruples
his
wife
had
foreseen
strefford
coming
back
one
evening
from
the
lido
reported
having
recognized
the
huge
outline
of
the
ibis
among
the
pleasure
craft
of
the
outer
harbour
and
the
very
next
evening
as
the
guests
of
palazzo
vanderlyn
were
sipping
their
ices
at
florian
s
the
hickses
loomed
up
across
the
piazza
susy
pleaded
in
vain
with
her
husband
in
defence
of
his
privacy
remember
you
re
here
to
write
dearest
it
s
your
duty
not
to
let
any
one
interfere
with
that
why
shouldn
t
we
tell
them
we
re
just
leaving
because
it
s
no
use
we
re
sure
to
be
always
meeting
them
and
besides
i
ll
be
hanged
if
i
m
going
to
shirk
the
hickses
i
spent
five
whole
months
on
the
ibis
and
if
they
bored
me
occasionally
india
didn
we
ll
make
them
take
us
to
aquileia
anyhow
said
strefford
philosophically
and
the
next
moment
the
hickses
were
bearing
down
on
the
defenceless
trio
they
presented
a
formidable
front
not
only
because
of
their
mere
physical
bulk
and
hicks
were
equally
and
majestically
but
because
they
never
moved
abroad
without
the
escort
of
two
private
secretaries
one
for
the
foreign
languages
hicks
s
doctor
a
maiden
lady
known
as
eldoradder
tooker
who
was
hicks
s
cousin
and
stenographer
and
finally
their
daughter
coral
hicks
coral
hicks
when
susy
had
last
encountered
the
party
had
been
a
fat
spectacled
always
lagging
behind
her
parents
with
a
reluctant
poodle
in
her
wake
now
the
poodle
had
gone
and
his
mistress
led
the
procession
the
fat
had
changed
into
a
young
lady
of
compact
if
not
graceful
outline
a
eyeglass
had
replaced
the
spectacles
and
through
it
instead
of
a
sullen
glare
miss
coral
hicks
projected
on
the
world
a
glance
at
once
confident
and
critical
she
looked
so
strong
and
so
assured
that
susy
taking
her
measure
in
a
flash
saw
that
her
position
at
the
head
of
the
procession
was
not
fortuitous
and
murmured
inwardly
thank
goodness
she
s
not
pretty
too
if
she
was
not
pretty
she
was
and
if
she
was
overeducated
she
seemed
capable
as
strefford
had
suggested
of
carrying
off
even
this
crowning
disadvantage
at
any
rate
she
was
above
disguising
it
and
before
the
whole
party
had
been
seated
five
minutes
in
front
of
a
fresh
supply
of
ices
with
eldorada
and
the
secretaries
at
a
table
slightly
in
the
background
she
had
taken
up
with
nick
the
question
of
exploration
in
mesopotamia
queer
child
coral
he
said
to
susy
that
night
as
they
smoked
a
last
cigarette
on
their
balcony
she
told
me
this
afternoon
that
she
d
remembered
lots
of
things
she
heard
me
say
in
india
i
thought
at
the
time
that
she
cared
only
for
caramels
and
but
it
seems
she
was
listening
to
everything
and
reading
all
the
books
she
could
lay
her
hands
on
and
she
got
so
bitten
with
oriental
archaeology
that
she
took
a
course
last
year
at
bryn
mawr
she
means
to
go
to
bagdad
next
spring
and
back
by
the
persian
plateau
and
susy
laughed
luxuriously
she
was
sitting
with
her
hand
in
nick
s
while
the
late
moon
theirs
again
rounded
its
glory
above
the
belfry
of
san
giorgio
poor
coral
how
dreary
susy
murmured
dreary
why
a
trip
like
that
is
about
as
well
worth
doing
as
anything
i
oh
i
meant
dreary
to
do
it
without
you
or
me
she
laughed
getting
up
lazily
to
go
indoors
a
broad
band
of
moonlight
dividing
her
room
onto
two
shadowy
halves
lay
on
the
painted
venetian
bed
with
its
sheet
its
old
damask
coverlet
and
pillows
she
felt
the
warmth
of
nick
s
enfolding
arm
and
lifted
her
face
to
his
the
hickses
retained
the
most
tender
memory
of
nick
s
sojourn
on
the
ibis
and
susy
moved
by
their
artless
pleasure
in
meeting
him
again
was
glad
he
had
not
followed
her
advice
and
tried
to
elude
them
she
had
always
admired
strefford
s
ruthless
talent
for
using
and
discarding
the
human
material
in
his
path
but
now
she
began
to
hope
that
nick
would
not
remember
her
suggestion
that
he
should
mete
out
that
measure
to
the
hickses
even
if
it
had
been
less
pleasant
to
have
a
big
yacht
at
their
door
during
the
long
golden
days
and
the
nights
of
silver
fire
the
hickses
admiration
for
nick
would
have
made
susy
suffer
them
gladly
she
even
began
to
be
aware
of
a
growing
liking
for
them
a
liking
inspired
by
the
very
characteristics
that
would
once
have
provoked
her
disapproval
susy
had
had
plenty
of
training
in
liking
common
people
with
big
purses
in
such
cases
her
stock
of
allowances
and
extenuations
was
inexhaustible
but
they
had
to
be
successful
common
people
and
the
trouble
was
that
the
hickses
judged
by
her
standards
were
failures
it
was
not
only
that
they
were
ridiculous
so
heaven
knew
were
many
of
their
rivals
but
the
hickses
were
both
ridiculous
and
unsuccessful
they
had
consistently
resisted
the
efforts
of
the
experienced
advisers
who
had
first
descried
them
on
the
horizon
and
tried
to
help
them
upward
they
were
always
taking
up
the
wrong
people
giving
the
wrong
kind
of
party
and
spending
millions
on
things
that
nobody
who
mattered
cared
about
they
all
believed
passionately
in
movements
and
causes
and
ideals
and
were
always
attended
by
the
exponents
of
their
latest
beliefs
always
asking
you
to
hear
lectures
by
haggard
women
in
peplums
and
having
their
portraits
painted
by
wild
people
who
never
turned
out
to
be
the
fashion
all
this
would
formerly
have
increased
susy
s
contempt
now
she
found
herself
liking
the
hickses
most
for
their
failings
she
was
touched
by
their
simple
good
faith
their
isolation
in
the
midst
of
all
their
queer
apostles
and
parasites
their
way
of
drifting
about
an
alien
and
indifferent
world
in
a
compactly
clinging
group
of
which
eldorada
tooker
the
doctor
and
the
two
secretaries
formed
the
outer
fringe
and
by
their
view
of
themselves
as
a
kind
of
collective
of
some
past
state
of
princely
culture
symbolised
for
hicks
in
what
she
called
the
court
of
the
eldorada
of
course
was
their
chief
prophetess
but
even
the
intensely
bright
and
modern
young
secretaries
beck
and
buttles
showed
a
touching
tendency
to
share
her
view
and
spoke
of
hicks
as
promoting
art
in
the
spirit
of
pandolfino
celebrating
the
munificence
of
the
medicis
i
m
getting
really
fond
of
the
hickses
i
believe
i
should
be
nice
to
them
even
if
they
were
staying
at
danieli
s
susy
said
to
strefford
and
even
if
you
owned
the
yacht
he
answered
and
for
once
his
banter
struck
her
as
beside
the
point
the
ibis
carried
them
during
the
endless
june
days
far
and
wide
along
the
enchanted
shores
they
roamed
among
the
euganeans
they
saw
aquileia
and
pomposa
and
ravenna
their
hosts
would
gladly
have
taken
them
farther
across
the
adriatic
and
on
into
the
golden
network
of
the
ægean
but
susy
resisted
this
infraction
of
nick
s
rules
and
he
himself
preferred
to
stick
to
his
task
only
now
he
wrote
in
the
early
mornings
so
that
on
most
days
they
could
set
out
before
noon
and
steam
back
late
to
the
low
fringe
of
lights
on
the
lagoon
his
work
continued
to
progress
and
as
page
was
added
to
page
susy
obscurely
but
surely
perceived
that
each
one
corresponded
with
a
hidden
secretion
of
energy
the
gradual
forming
within
him
of
something
that
might
eventually
alter
both
their
lives
in
what
sense
she
could
not
conjecture
she
merely
felt
that
the
fact
of
his
having
chosen
a
job
and
stuck
to
it
if
only
through
a
few
rosy
summer
weeks
had
already
given
him
a
new
way
of
saying
yes
and
vii
of
some
new
ferment
at
work
in
him
nick
lansing
himself
was
equally
aware
he
was
a
better
judge
of
the
book
he
was
trying
to
write
than
either
susy
or
strefford
he
knew
its
weaknesses
its
treacheries
its
tendency
to
slip
through
his
fingers
just
as
he
thought
his
grasp
tightest
but
he
knew
also
that
at
the
very
moment
when
it
seemed
to
have
failed
him
it
would
suddenly
be
back
beating
its
loud
wings
in
his
face
he
had
no
delusions
as
to
its
commercial
value
and
had
winced
more
than
he
triumphed
when
susy
produced
her
allusion
to
marius
his
book
was
to
be
called
the
pageant
of
alexander
his
imagination
had
been
enchanted
by
the
idea
of
picturing
the
young
conqueror
s
advance
through
the
fabulous
landscapes
of
asia
he
liked
writing
descriptions
and
vaguely
felt
that
under
the
guise
of
fiction
he
could
develop
his
theory
of
oriental
influences
in
western
art
at
the
expense
of
less
learning
than
if
he
had
tried
to
put
his
ideas
into
an
essay
he
knew
enough
of
his
subject
to
know
that
he
did
not
know
enough
to
write
about
it
but
he
consoled
himself
by
remembering
that
wilhelm
meister
has
survived
many
weighty
volumes
on
aesthetics
and
between
his
moments
of
he
took
himself
at
susy
s
valuation
and
found
an
unmixed
joy
in
his
task
never
no
never
had
he
been
so
boundlessly
so
confidently
happy
his
had
given
him
the
habit
of
application
and
now
habit
wore
the
glow
of
inspiration
his
previous
literary
ventures
had
been
timid
and
tentative
if
this
one
was
growing
and
strengthening
on
his
hands
it
must
be
because
the
conditions
were
so
different
he
was
at
ease
he
was
secure
he
was
satisfied
and
he
had
also
for
the
first
time
since
his
early
youth
before
his
mother
s
death
the
sense
of
having
some
one
to
look
after
some
one
who
was
his
own
particular
care
and
to
whom
he
was
answerable
for
himself
and
his
actions
as
he
had
never
felt
himself
answerable
to
the
hurried
and
indifferent
people
among
whom
he
had
chosen
to
live
susy
had
the
same
standards
as
these
people
she
spoke
their
language
though
she
understood
others
she
required
their
pleasures
if
she
did
not
revere
their
gods
but
from
the
moment
that
she
had
become
his
property
he
had
built
up
in
himself
a
conception
of
her
answering
to
some
need
of
veneration
she
was
his
he
had
chosen
her
she
had
taken
her
place
in
the
long
line
of
lansing
women
who
had
been
loved
honoured
and
probably
deceived
by
bygone
lansing
men
he
didn
t
pretend
to
understand
the
logic
of
it
but
the
fact
that
she
was
his
wife
gave
purpose
and
continuity
to
his
scattered
impulses
and
a
mysterious
glow
of
consecration
to
his
task
once
or
twice
in
the
first
days
of
his
marriage
he
had
asked
himself
with
a
slight
shiver
what
would
happen
if
susy
should
begin
to
bore
him
the
thing
had
happened
to
him
with
other
women
as
to
whom
his
first
emotions
had
not
differed
in
intensity
from
those
she
inspired
the
part
he
had
played
in
his
previous
might
indeed
have
been
summed
up
in
the
memorable
line
i
am
the
hunter
and
the
prey
for
he
had
invariably
ceased
to
be
the
first
only
to
regard
himself
as
the
second
this
experience
had
never
ceased
to
cause
him
the
liveliest
pain
since
his
sympathy
for
his
pursuer
was
only
less
keen
than
his
commiseration
for
himself
but
as
he
was
always
a
little
sorrier
for
himself
he
had
always
ended
by
distancing
the
pursuer
all
these
experiences
now
seemed
utterly
inapplicable
to
the
new
man
he
had
become
he
could
not
imagine
being
bored
by
susy
or
trying
to
escape
from
her
if
he
were
he
could
not
think
of
her
as
an
enemy
or
even
as
an
accomplice
since
accomplices
are
potential
enemies
she
was
some
one
with
whom
by
some
miracle
joys
above
the
joys
of
friendship
were
to
be
tasted
but
who
even
through
these
fleeting
ecstasies
remained
simply
and
securely
his
friend
these
new
feelings
did
not
affect
his
general
attitude
toward
life
they
merely
confirmed
his
faith
in
its
ultimate
never
had
he
more
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
things
he
had
always
enjoyed
a
good
dinner
had
never
been
as
good
to
him
a
beautiful
sunset
as
beautiful
he
still
rejoiced
in
the
fact
that
he
appreciated
both
with
an
equal
acuity
he
was
as
proud
as
ever
of
susy
s
cleverness
and
freedom
from
prejudice
she
couldn
t
be
too
modern
for
him
now
that
she
was
his
he
shared
to
the
full
her
passionate
enjoyment
of
the
present
and
all
her
feverish
eagerness
to
make
it
last
he
knew
when
she
was
thinking
of
ways
of
extending
their
golden
opportunity
and
he
secretly
thought
with
her
wondering
what
new
means
they
could
devise
he
was
thankful
that
ellie
vanderlyn
was
still
absent
and
began
to
hope
they
might
have
the
palace
to
themselves
for
the
remainder
of
the
summer
if
they
did
he
would
have
time
to
finish
his
book
and
susy
to
lay
up
a
little
interest
on
their
wedding
cheques
and
thus
their
enchanted
year
might
conceivably
be
prolonged
to
two
late
as
the
season
was
their
presence
and
strefford
s
in
venice
had
already
drawn
thither
several
wandering
members
of
their
set
it
was
characteristic
of
these
indifferent
but
agglutinative
people
that
they
could
never
remain
long
parted
from
each
other
without
a
dim
sense
of
uneasiness
lansing
was
familiar
with
the
feeling
he
had
known
slight
twinges
of
it
himself
and
had
often
ministered
to
its
qualms
in
others
it
was
hardly
stronger
than
the
faint
gnawing
which
recalls
the
to
one
who
has
lunched
well
and
is
sure
of
dining
as
abundantly
but
it
gave
a
purpose
to
the
purposeless
and
helped
many
hesitating
spirits
over
the
annual
difficulty
of
deciding
between
deauville
and
moritz
biarritz
and
capri
nick
was
not
surprised
to
learn
that
it
was
becoming
the
fashion
that
summer
to
pop
down
to
venice
and
take
a
look
at
the
lansings
streffy
had
set
the
example
and
streffy
s
example
was
always
followed
and
then
susy
s
marriage
was
still
a
subject
of
sympathetic
speculation
people
knew
the
story
of
the
wedding
cheques
and
were
interested
in
seeing
how
long
they
could
be
made
to
last
it
was
going
to
be
the
thing
that
year
to
help
prolong
the
by
pressing
houses
on
the
adventurous
couple
before
june
was
over
a
band
of
friends
were
basking
with
the
lansings
on
the
lido
nick
found
himself
unexpectedly
disturbed
by
their
arrival
to
avoid
comment
and
banter
he
put
his
book
aside
and
forbade
susy
to
speak
of
it
explaining
to
her
that
he
needed
an
interval
of
rest
his
wife
instantly
and
exaggeratedly
adopted
this
view
guarding
him
from
the
temptation
to
work
as
jealously
as
she
had
discouraged
him
from
idling
and
he
was
careful
not
to
let
her
find
out
that
the
change
in
his
habits
coincided
with
his
having
reached
a
difficult
point
in
his
book
but
though
he
was
not
sorry
to
stop
writing
he
found
himself
unexpectedly
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
his
leisure
for
the
first
time
communal
dawdling
had
lost
its
charm
for
him
not
because
his
fellow
dawdlers
were
less
congenial
than
of
old
but
because
in
the
interval
he
had
known
something
so
immeasurably
better
he
had
always
felt
himself
to
be
the
superior
of
his
habitual
associates
but
now
the
advantage
was
too
great
really
in
a
sense
it
was
hardly
fair
to
them
he
had
flattered
himself
that
susy
would
share
this
feeling
but
he
perceived
with
annoyance
that
the
arrival
of
their
friends
heightened
her
animation
it
was
as
if
the
inward
glow
which
had
given
her
a
new
beauty
were
now
refracted
upon
her
by
the
presence
of
the
very
people
they
had
come
to
venice
to
avoid
lansing
was
vaguely
irritated
and
when
he
asked
her
how
she
liked
being
with
their
old
crowd
again
his
irritation
was
increased
by
her
answering
with
a
laugh
that
she
only
hoped
the
poor
dears
didn
t
see
too
plainly
how
they
bored
her
the
patent
insincerity
of
the
reply
was
a
shock
to
lansing
he
knew
that
susy
was
not
really
bored
and
he
understood
that
she
had
simply
guessed
his
feelings
and
instinctively
adopted
them
that
henceforth
she
was
always
going
to
think
as
he
thought
to
confirm
this
fear
he
said
carelessly
oh
all
the
same
it
s
rather
jolly
knocking
about
with
them
again
for
a
bit
and
she
answered
at
once
and
with
equal
conviction
yes
isn
t
it
the
old
darlings
all
the
same
a
fear
of
the
future
again
laid
its
cold
touch
on
lansing
susy
s
independence
and
had
been
among
her
chief
attractions
if
she
were
to
turn
into
an
echo
their
delicious
duet
ran
the
risk
of
becoming
the
dullest
of
monologues
he
forgot
that
five
minutes
earlier
he
had
resented
her
being
glad
to
see
their
friends
and
for
a
moment
he
found
himself
leaning
dizzily
over
that
insoluble
riddle
of
the
sentimental
life
that
to
be
differed
with
is
exasperating
and
to
be
agreed
with
monotonous
once
more
he
began
to
wonder
if
he
were
not
fundamentally
unfitted
for
the
married
state
and
was
saved
from
despair
only
by
remembering
that
susy
s
subjection
to
his
moods
was
not
likely
to
last
but
even
then
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
reflect
that
his
apprehensions
were
superfluous
since
their
tie
was
avowedly
a
temporary
one
of
the
special
understanding
on
which
their
marriage
had
been
based
not
a
trace
remained
in
his
thoughts
of
her
the
idea
that
he
or
she
might
ever
renounce
each
other
for
their
mutual
good
had
long
since
dwindled
to
the
ghost
of
an
old
joke
it
was
borne
in
on
him
after
a
week
or
two
of
unbroken
sociability
that
of
all
his
old
friends
it
was
the
mortimer
hickses
who
bored
him
the
least
the
hickses
had
left
the
ibis
for
an
apartment
in
a
vast
dilapidated
palace
near
the
canareggio
they
had
hired
the
apartment
from
a
painter
one
of
their
newest
discoveries
and
they
put
up
philosophically
with
the
absence
of
modern
conveniences
in
order
to
secure
the
inestimable
advantage
of
in
this
privileged
air
they
gathered
about
them
their
usual
mixed
company
of
quiet
studious
people
and
noisy
exponents
of
new
theories
themselves
totally
unconscious
of
the
disparity
between
their
different
guests
and
beamingly
convinced
that
at
last
they
were
seated
at
the
source
of
wisdom
in
old
days
lansing
would
have
got
half
an
hour
s
amusement
followed
by
a
long
evening
of
boredom
from
the
sight
of
hicks
vast
and
jewelled
seated
between
a
professor
of
archaeology
and
a
composer
or
the
high
priest
of
a
new
while
hicks
beaming
above
his
vast
white
waistcoat
saw
to
it
that
the
champagne
flowed
more
abundantly
than
the
talk
and
the
bright
young
secretaries
industriously
kept
up
with
the
dizzy
of
prophecy
and
erudition
but
a
change
had
come
over
lansing
hitherto
it
was
in
contrast
to
his
own
friends
that
the
hickses
had
seemed
most
insufferable
now
it
was
as
an
escape
from
these
same
friends
that
they
had
become
not
only
sympathetic
but
even
interesting
it
was
something
after
all
to
be
with
people
who
did
not
regard
venice
simply
as
affording
exceptional
opportunities
for
bathing
and
adultery
but
who
were
reverently
if
confusedly
aware
that
they
were
in
the
presence
of
something
unique
and
ineffable
and
determined
to
make
the
utmost
of
their
privilege
after
all
he
said
to
himself
one
evening
as
his
eyes
wandered
with
somewhat
of
a
convalescent
s
simple
joy
from
one
to
another
of
their
large
confiding
faces
after
all
they
ve
got
a
religion
the
phrase
struck
him
in
the
moment
of
using
it
as
indicating
a
new
element
in
his
own
state
of
mind
and
as
being
in
fact
the
key
to
his
new
feeling
about
the
hickses
their
muddled
ardour
for
great
things
was
related
to
his
own
new
view
of
the
universe
the
people
who
felt
however
dimly
the
wonder
and
weight
of
life
must
ever
after
be
nearer
to
him
than
those
to
whom
it
was
estimated
solely
by
one
s
balance
at
the
bank
he
supposed
on
reflexion
that
that
was
what
he
meant
when
he
thought
of
the
hickses
as
having
a
religion
a
few
days
later
his
was
unexpectedly
disturbed
by
the
arrival
of
fred
gillow
lansing
had
always
felt
a
tolerant
liking
for
gillow
a
large
smiling
silent
young
man
with
an
intense
and
serious
desire
to
miss
nothing
attainable
by
one
of
his
fortune
and
standing
what
use
he
made
of
his
experiences
lansing
who
had
always
gone
into
his
own
modest
adventures
rather
thoroughly
had
never
been
able
to
guess
but
he
had
always
suspected
the
prodigal
fred
of
being
no
more
than
a
now
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
view
him
with
another
eye
the
gillows
were
in
fact
the
one
uneasy
point
in
nick
s
conscience
he
and
susy
from
the
first
had
talked
of
them
less
than
of
any
other
members
of
their
group
they
had
tacitly
avoided
the
name
from
the
day
on
which
susy
had
come
to
lansing
s
lodgings
to
say
that
ursula
gillow
had
asked
her
to
renounce
him
till
that
other
day
just
before
their
marriage
when
she
had
met
him
with
the
rapturous
cry
here
s
our
first
wedding
present
such
a
thumping
big
cheque
from
fred
and
ursula
plenty
of
sympathizing
people
were
ready
lansing
knew
to
tell
him
just
what
had
happened
in
the
interval
between
those
two
dates
but
he
had
taken
care
not
to
ask
he
had
even
affected
an
initiation
so
complete
that
the
friends
who
burned
to
enlighten
him
were
discouraged
by
his
so
obviously
knowing
more
than
they
and
gradually
he
had
worked
himself
around
to
their
view
and
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
he
really
did
now
he
perceived
that
he
knew
nothing
at
all
and
that
the
hullo
old
fred
with
which
susy
hailed
gillow
s
arrival
might
be
either
the
usual
tribal
welcome
since
they
were
all
old
and
all
nicknamed
in
their
private
jargon
or
a
greeting
that
concealed
inscrutable
depths
of
complicity
susy
was
visibly
glad
to
see
gillow
but
she
was
glad
of
everything
just
then
and
so
glad
to
show
her
gladness
the
fact
disarmed
her
husband
and
made
him
ashamed
of
his
uneasiness
you
ought
to
have
thought
this
all
out
sooner
or
else
you
ought
to
chuck
thinking
of
it
at
all
was
the
sound
but
ineffectual
advice
he
gave
himself
on
the
day
after
gillow
s
arrival
and
immediately
set
to
work
to
rethink
the
whole
matter
fred
gillow
showed
no
consciousness
of
disturbing
any
one
s
peace
of
mind
day
after
day
he
sprawled
for
hours
on
the
lido
sands
his
arms
folded
under
his
head
listening
to
streffy
s
nonsense
and
watching
susy
between
sleepy
lids
but
he
betrayed
no
desire
to
see
her
alone
or
to
draw
her
into
talk
apart
from
the
others
more
than
ever
he
seemed
content
to
be
the
gratified
spectator
of
a
costly
show
got
up
for
his
private
entertainment
it
was
not
until
he
heard
her
one
morning
grumble
a
little
at
the
increasing
heat
and
the
menace
of
mosquitoes
that
he
said
quite
as
if
they
had
talked
the
matter
over
long
before
and
finally
settled
it
the
moor
will
be
ready
any
time
after
the
first
of
nick
fancied
that
susy
coloured
a
little
and
drew
herself
up
more
defiantly
than
usual
as
she
sent
a
pebble
skimming
across
the
dying
ripples
at
their
feet
you
ll
be
a
lot
cooler
in
scotland
fred
added
with
what
for
him
was
an
unusual
effort
at
explicitness
oh
shall
we
she
retorted
gaily
and
added
with
an
air
of
mystery
and
importance
pivoting
about
on
her
high
heels
nick
s
got
work
to
do
here
it
will
probably
keep
us
all
work
rot
you
ll
die
of
the
gillow
stared
perplexedly
skyward
from
under
his
tilted
and
then
brought
out
as
from
the
depth
of
a
rankling
grievance
i
thought
it
was
all
why
nick
asked
his
wife
that
night
as
they
ellie
s
cool
after
a
late
dinner
at
the
lido
did
gillow
think
it
was
understood
that
we
were
going
to
his
moor
in
august
he
was
conscious
of
the
oddness
of
speaking
of
their
friend
by
his
surname
and
reddened
at
his
blunder
susy
had
let
her
lace
cloak
slide
to
her
feet
and
stood
before
him
in
the
room
slim
and
through
black
transparencies
she
raised
her
eyebrows
carelessly
i
told
you
long
ago
he
d
asked
us
there
for
you
didn
t
tell
me
you
d
she
smiled
as
if
he
had
said
something
as
simple
as
fred
i
accepted
everything
from
everybody
what
could
he
answer
it
was
the
very
principle
on
which
their
bargain
had
been
struck
and
if
he
were
to
say
ah
but
this
is
different
because
i
m
jealous
of
gillow
what
light
would
such
an
answer
shed
on
his
past
the
time
for
being
jealous
if
so
antiquated
an
attitude
were
on
any
ground
defensible
would
have
been
before
his
marriage
and
before
the
acceptance
of
the
bounties
which
had
helped
to
make
it
possible
he
wondered
a
little
now
that
in
those
days
such
scruples
had
not
troubled
him
his
inconsistency
irritated
him
and
increased
his
irritation
against
gillow
i
suppose
he
thinks
he
owns
us
he
grumbled
inwardly
he
had
thrown
himself
into
an
armchair
and
susy
advancing
across
the
shining
arabesques
of
the
floor
slid
down
at
his
feet
pressed
her
slender
length
against
him
and
whispered
with
lifted
face
and
lips
close
to
his
we
needn
t
ever
go
anywhere
you
don
t
want
for
once
her
submission
was
sweet
and
folding
her
close
he
whispered
back
through
his
kiss
not
there
in
her
response
to
his
embrace
he
felt
the
acquiescence
of
her
whole
happy
self
in
whatever
future
he
decided
on
if
only
it
gave
them
enough
of
such
moments
as
this
and
as
they
held
each
other
fast
in
silence
his
doubts
and
distrust
began
to
seem
like
a
silly
injustice
let
us
stay
here
as
long
as
ever
ellie
will
let
us
he
said
as
if
the
shadowy
walls
and
shining
floors
were
a
magic
boundary
drawn
about
his
happiness
she
murmured
her
assent
and
stood
up
stretching
her
sleepy
arm
above
her
shoulders
how
dreadfully
late
it
is
will
you
unhook
me
oh
there
s
a
she
picked
it
up
from
the
table
and
tearing
it
open
stared
a
moment
at
the
message
it
s
from
ellie
she
s
coming
she
turned
to
the
window
and
strayed
out
onto
the
balcony
nick
followed
her
with
enlacing
arm
the
canal
below
them
lay
in
moonless
shadow
barred
with
a
few
lingering
lights
a
last
snatch
of
came
from
far
off
carried
upward
on
a
sultry
gust
dear
old
ellie
all
the
same
i
wish
all
this
belonged
to
you
and
susy
sighed
viii
it
was
not
vanderlyn
s
fault
if
after
her
arrival
her
palace
seemed
to
belong
any
less
to
the
lansings
she
arrived
in
a
mood
of
such
general
benevolence
that
it
was
impossible
for
susy
when
they
finally
found
themselves
alone
to
make
her
view
even
her
own
recent
conduct
in
any
but
the
most
benevolent
light
i
knew
you
d
be
the
veriest
angel
about
it
all
darling
because
i
knew
you
d
understand
me
especially
now
she
declared
her
slim
hands
in
susy
s
her
big
eyes
so
like
clarissa
s
resplendent
with
past
pleasures
and
future
plans
the
expression
of
her
confidence
was
unexpectedly
distasteful
to
susy
lansing
who
had
never
lent
so
cold
an
ear
to
such
warm
avowals
she
had
always
imagined
that
being
happy
one
s
self
made
one
as
vanderlyn
appeared
to
assume
more
tolerant
of
the
happiness
of
others
of
however
doubtful
elements
composed
and
she
was
almost
ashamed
of
responding
so
languidly
to
her
friend
s
outpourings
but
she
herself
had
no
desire
to
confide
her
bliss
to
ellie
and
why
should
not
ellie
observe
a
similar
reticence
it
was
all
so
perfect
you
see
dearest
i
was
meant
to
be
happy
that
lady
continued
as
if
the
possession
of
so
unusual
a
characteristic
singled
her
out
for
special
privileges
susy
with
a
certain
sharpness
responded
that
she
had
always
supposed
we
all
were
oh
no
dearest
not
governesses
and
and
companions
and
that
sort
of
people
they
wouldn
t
know
how
if
they
tried
but
you
and
i
darling
oh
i
don
t
consider
myself
in
any
way
exceptional
susy
intervened
she
longed
to
add
not
in
your
way
at
any
rate
but
a
few
minutes
earlier
vanderlyn
had
told
her
that
the
palace
was
at
her
disposal
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
and
that
she
herself
was
only
going
to
perch
there
if
they
d
let
her
long
enough
to
gather
up
her
things
and
start
for
moritz
the
memory
of
this
announcement
had
the
effect
of
curbing
susy
s
irony
and
of
making
her
shift
the
conversation
to
the
safer
if
scarcely
less
absorbing
topic
of
the
number
of
day
and
evening
dresses
required
for
a
season
at
moritz
as
she
listened
to
vanderlyn
no
less
eloquent
on
this
theme
than
on
the
other
susy
began
to
measure
the
gulf
between
her
past
and
present
this
is
the
life
i
used
to
lead
these
are
the
things
i
used
to
live
for
she
thought
as
she
stood
before
the
outspread
glories
of
vanderlyn
s
wardrobe
not
that
she
did
not
still
care
she
could
not
look
at
ellie
s
laces
and
silks
and
furs
without
picturing
herself
in
them
and
wondering
by
what
new
miracle
of
management
she
could
give
herself
the
air
of
being
dressed
by
the
same
consummate
artists
but
these
had
become
minor
interests
the
past
few
months
had
given
her
a
new
perspective
and
the
thing
that
most
puzzled
and
disconcerted
her
about
ellie
was
the
fact
that
love
and
finery
and
bridge
and
were
seemingly
all
on
the
same
plane
to
her
the
inspection
of
the
dresses
lasted
a
long
time
and
was
marked
by
many
fluctuations
of
mood
on
the
part
of
vanderlyn
who
passed
from
comparative
hopefulness
to
despair
at
the
total
inadequacy
of
her
wardrobe
it
wouldn
t
do
to
go
to
moritz
looking
like
a
frump
and
yet
there
was
no
time
to
get
anything
sent
from
paris
and
whatever
she
did
she
wasn
t
going
to
show
herself
in
any
dowdy
done
at
home
but
suddenly
light
broke
on
her
and
she
clasped
her
hands
for
joy
why
nelson
ll
bring
them
i
d
forgotten
all
about
nelson
there
ll
be
just
time
if
i
wire
to
him
at
is
nelson
going
to
join
you
at
moritz
susy
asked
surprised
heavens
no
he
s
coming
here
to
pick
up
clarissa
and
take
her
to
some
stuffy
cure
in
austria
with
his
mother
it
s
too
lucky
there
s
just
time
to
telegraph
him
to
bring
my
things
i
didn
t
mean
to
wait
for
him
but
it
won
t
delay
me
more
than
day
or
susy
s
heart
sank
she
was
not
much
afraid
of
ellie
alone
but
ellie
and
nelson
together
formed
an
incalculable
menace
no
one
could
tell
what
spark
of
truth
might
dash
from
their
collision
susy
felt
that
she
could
deal
with
the
two
dangers
separately
and
successively
but
not
together
and
simultaneously
but
ellie
why
should
you
wait
for
nelson
i
m
certain
to
find
someone
here
who
s
going
to
moritz
and
will
take
your
things
if
he
brings
them
it
s
a
pity
to
risk
losing
your
this
argument
appealed
for
a
moment
to
vanderlyn
that
s
true
they
say
all
the
hotels
are
jammed
you
dear
you
re
always
so
practical
she
clasped
susy
to
her
scented
bosom
and
you
know
darling
i
m
sure
you
ll
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
you
and
nick
oh
don
t
be
hypocritical
and
say
nonsense
you
see
i
understand
i
used
to
think
of
you
so
often
you
two
during
those
blessed
weeks
when
we
two
were
alone
the
sudden
tears
brimming
over
ellie
s
lovely
eyes
and
threatening
to
make
the
blue
circles
below
them
run
into
the
adjoining
carmine
filled
susy
with
compunction
poor
thing
oh
poor
thing
she
thought
and
hearing
herself
called
by
nick
who
was
waiting
to
take
her
out
for
their
usual
sunset
on
the
lagoon
she
felt
a
wave
of
pity
for
the
deluded
creature
who
would
never
taste
that
highest
of
imaginable
joys
but
all
the
same
susy
reflected
as
she
hurried
down
to
her
husband
i
m
glad
i
persuaded
her
not
to
wait
for
some
days
had
elapsed
since
susy
and
nick
had
had
a
sunset
to
themselves
and
in
the
interval
susy
had
once
again
learned
the
superior
quality
of
the
sympathy
that
held
them
together
she
now
viewed
all
the
rest
of
life
as
no
more
than
a
show
a
jolly
show
which
it
would
have
been
a
thousand
pities
to
miss
but
which
if
the
need
arose
they
could
get
up
and
leave
at
any
moment
provided
that
they
left
it
together
in
the
dusk
while
their
prow
slid
over
inverted
palaces
and
through
the
scent
of
hidden
gardens
she
leaned
against
him
and
murmured
her
mind
returning
to
the
recent
scene
with
ellie
nick
should
you
hate
me
dreadfully
if
i
had
no
clothes
her
husband
was
kindling
a
cigarette
and
the
match
lit
up
the
grin
with
which
he
answered
but
my
dear
have
i
ever
shown
the
slightest
symptom
oh
rubbish
when
a
woman
says
no
clothes
she
means
not
the
right
he
took
a
meditative
puff
ah
you
ve
been
going
over
ellie
s
finery
with
yes
all
those
trunks
and
trunks
full
and
she
finds
she
s
got
nothing
for
moritz
of
course
he
murmured
drowsy
with
content
and
manifesting
but
a
languid
interest
in
the
subject
of
vanderlyn
s
wardrobe
only
fancy
she
very
nearly
decided
to
stop
over
for
nelson
s
arrival
next
week
so
that
he
might
bring
her
two
or
three
more
trunkfuls
from
paris
but
mercifully
i
ve
managed
to
persuade
her
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
susy
felt
a
hardly
perceptible
shifting
of
her
husband
s
lounging
body
and
was
aware
through
all
her
watchful
tentacles
of
a
widening
of
his
lids
you
managed
she
fancied
he
paused
on
the
word
ironically
but
why
why
what
why
on
earth
should
you
try
to
prevent
ellie
s
waiting
for
nelson
if
for
once
in
her
life
she
wants
to
susy
conscious
of
reddening
suddenly
drew
back
as
though
the
leap
of
her
heart
might
have
penetrated
the
blue
flannel
shoulder
against
which
she
leaned
really
dearest
she
murmured
but
with
a
sudden
doggedness
he
renewed
his
why
because
she
s
in
such
a
fever
to
get
to
moritz
and
in
such
a
funk
lest
the
hotel
shouldn
t
keep
her
rooms
susy
somewhat
breathlessly
produced
ah
i
nick
paused
again
you
re
a
devoted
friend
aren
t
you
what
an
odd
question
there
s
hardly
anyone
i
ve
reason
to
be
more
devoted
to
than
ellie
his
wife
answered
and
she
felt
his
contrite
clasp
on
her
hand
darling
no
nor
i
or
more
grateful
to
for
leaving
us
alone
in
this
dimness
had
fallen
on
the
waters
and
her
lifted
lips
met
his
bending
ones
trailing
late
into
dinner
that
evening
ellie
announced
that
after
all
she
had
decided
it
was
safest
to
wait
for
nelson
i
should
simply
worry
myself
ill
if
i
weren
t
sure
of
getting
my
things
she
said
in
the
tone
of
tender
solicitude
with
which
she
always
discussed
her
own
difficulties
after
all
people
who
deny
themselves
everything
do
get
warped
and
bitter
don
t
they
she
argued
plaintively
her
lovely
eyes
wandering
from
one
to
the
other
of
her
assembled
friends
strefford
remarked
gravely
that
it
was
the
complaint
which
had
fatally
undermined
his
own
health
and
in
the
laugh
that
followed
the
party
drifted
into
the
great
vaulted
oh
i
don
t
mind
your
laughing
at
me
streffy
darling
his
hostess
retorted
pressing
his
arm
against
her
own
and
susy
receiving
the
shock
of
their
rapidly
exchanged
glance
said
to
herself
with
a
sharp
twinge
of
apprehension
of
course
streffy
knows
everything
he
showed
no
surprise
at
finding
ellie
away
when
he
arrived
and
if
he
knows
what
s
to
prevent
nelson
s
finding
out
for
strefford
in
a
mood
of
mischief
was
no
more
to
be
trusted
than
a
malicious
child
susy
instantly
resolved
to
risk
speaking
to
him
if
need
be
even
betraying
to
him
the
secret
of
the
letters
only
by
revealing
the
depth
of
her
own
danger
could
she
hope
to
secure
his
silence
on
the
balcony
late
in
the
evening
while
the
others
were
listening
indoors
to
the
low
modulations
of
a
young
composer
who
had
embroidered
his
fancies
on
browning
s
toccata
susy
found
her
chance
strefford
unsummoned
had
followed
her
out
and
stood
silently
smoking
at
her
side
you
see
streff
oh
why
should
you
and
i
make
mysteries
to
each
other
she
suddenly
began
why
indeed
but
do
we
susy
glanced
back
at
the
group
around
the
piano
about
ellie
i
mean
and
lord
ellie
and
nelson
you
call
that
a
mystery
i
should
as
soon
apply
the
term
to
one
of
the
million
advertisements
that
adorn
your
native
well
yes
but
she
stopped
again
had
she
not
tacitly
promised
ellie
not
to
speak
my
susan
what
s
wrong
strefford
asked
i
don
t
know
well
i
do
then
you
re
afraid
that
if
ellie
and
nelson
meet
here
she
ll
blurt
out
something
oh
she
won
t
susy
cried
with
conviction
well
then
who
will
i
trust
that
superhuman
child
not
to
and
you
and
i
and
nick
oh
she
gasped
interrupting
him
that
s
just
it
nick
doesn
t
know
doesn
t
even
suspect
and
if
he
did
strefford
flung
away
his
cigar
and
turned
to
scrutinize
her
i
don
t
see
hanged
if
i
do
what
business
is
it
of
any
of
us
after
all
that
of
course
was
the
old
view
that
cloaked
connivance
in
an
air
of
decency
but
to
susy
it
no
longer
carried
conviction
and
she
hesitated
if
nick
should
find
out
that
i
know
good
lord
doesn
t
he
know
that
you
know
after
all
i
suppose
it
s
not
the
first
time
she
remained
silent
the
first
time
you
ve
received
confidences
from
married
friends
does
nick
suppose
you
ve
lived
even
to
your
tender
age
without
hang
it
what
s
come
over
you
child
what
had
indeed
that
she
could
make
clear
to
him
and
yet
more
than
ever
she
felt
the
need
of
having
him
securely
on
her
side
once
his
word
was
pledged
he
was
safe
otherwise
there
was
no
limit
to
his
capacity
for
wilful
harmfulness
look
here
streff
you
and
i
know
that
ellie
hasn
t
been
away
for
a
cure
and
that
if
poor
clarissa
was
sworn
to
secrecy
it
was
not
because
it
worries
father
to
think
that
mother
needs
to
take
care
of
her
she
paused
hating
herself
for
the
ironic
note
she
had
tried
to
sound
well
he
questioned
from
the
depths
of
the
chair
into
which
he
had
sunk
well
nick
doesn
t
doesn
t
dream
of
it
if
he
knew
that
we
owed
our
summer
here
to
to
my
knowing
strefford
sat
silent
she
felt
his
astonished
stare
through
the
darkness
jove
he
said
at
last
with
a
low
whistle
susy
bent
over
the
balustrade
her
heart
thumping
against
the
stone
rail
what
was
left
of
soul
i
wonder
the
young
composer
s
voice
shrilled
through
the
open
windows
strefford
sank
into
another
silence
from
which
he
roused
himself
only
as
susy
turned
back
toward
the
lighted
threshold
well
my
dear
we
ll
see
it
through
between
us
you
and
i
and
clarissa
he
said
with
his
rasping
laugh
rising
to
follow
her
he
caught
her
hand
and
gave
it
a
short
pressure
as
they
the
where
ellie
was
saying
plaintively
to
fred
gillow
i
can
never
hear
that
thing
sung
without
wanting
to
cry
like
a
ix
nelson
vanderlyn
still
in
his
travelling
clothes
paused
on
the
threshold
of
his
own
and
surveyed
the
scene
with
pardonable
satisfaction
he
was
a
short
round
man
with
a
grizzled
head
small
facetious
eyes
and
a
large
and
credulous
smile
at
the
luncheon
table
sat
his
wife
between
charlie
strefford
and
nick
lansing
next
to
strefford
perched
on
her
high
chair
clarissa
throned
in
infant
beauty
while
susy
lansing
cut
up
a
peach
for
her
through
wide
orange
awnings
the
sun
slanted
in
upon
the
group
well
well
well
so
i
ve
caught
you
at
it
cried
the
happy
father
whose
inveterate
habit
it
was
to
address
his
wife
and
friends
as
if
he
had
surprised
them
at
an
inopportune
moment
stealing
up
from
behind
he
lifted
his
daughter
into
the
air
while
a
chorus
of
hello
old
nelson
hailed
his
appearance
it
was
two
or
three
years
since
nick
lansing
had
seen
vanderlyn
who
was
now
the
london
representative
of
the
big
new
york
bank
of
vanderlyn
and
had
exchanged
his
sumptuous
house
in
fifth
avenue
for
another
more
sumptuous
still
in
mayfair
and
the
young
man
looked
curiously
and
attentively
at
his
host
vanderlyn
had
grown
older
and
stouter
but
his
face
still
kept
its
look
of
somewhat
worn
optimism
he
embraced
his
wife
greeted
susy
affectionately
and
distributed
cordial
to
the
two
men
hullo
he
exclaimed
suddenly
noticing
a
pearl
and
coral
trinket
hanging
from
clarissa
s
neck
who
s
been
giving
my
daughter
jewellery
i
d
like
to
know
oh
streffy
did
just
think
father
because
i
said
i
d
rather
have
it
than
a
book
you
know
clarissa
lucidly
explained
her
arms
tight
about
her
father
s
neck
her
beaming
eyes
on
strefford
nelson
vanderlyn
s
own
eyes
took
on
the
look
of
shrewdness
which
came
into
them
whenever
there
was
a
question
of
material
values
what
streffy
caught
you
at
it
eh
upon
my
the
brat
like
that
you
d
no
business
to
my
dear
lovely
baroque
pearl
he
protested
with
the
tone
of
the
rich
man
embarrassed
by
too
costly
a
gift
from
an
impecunious
friend
oh
hadn
t
i
why
because
it
s
too
good
for
clarissa
or
too
expensive
for
me
of
course
you
daren
t
imply
the
first
and
as
for
me
i
ve
had
a
windfall
and
am
blowing
it
in
on
the
strefford
lansing
had
noticed
always
used
american
slang
when
he
was
slightly
at
a
loss
and
wished
to
divert
attention
from
the
main
point
but
why
was
he
embarrassed
whose
attention
did
he
wish
to
divert
it
was
plain
that
vanderlyn
s
protest
had
been
merely
formal
like
most
of
the
wealthy
he
had
only
the
dimmest
notion
of
what
money
represented
to
the
poor
but
it
was
unusual
for
strefford
to
give
any
one
a
present
and
especially
an
expensive
one
perhaps
that
was
what
had
fixed
vanderlyn
s
attention
a
windfall
he
gaily
repeated
oh
a
tiny
one
i
was
offered
a
thumping
rent
for
my
little
place
at
como
and
dashed
over
here
to
squander
my
millions
with
the
rest
of
you
said
strefford
imperturbably
vanderlyn
s
look
immediately
became
interested
and
sympathetic
what
the
scene
of
the
he
included
nick
and
susy
in
his
friendly
smile
just
so
the
reward
of
virtue
i
say
give
me
a
cigar
will
you
old
man
i
left
some
awfully
good
ones
at
como
worse
luck
and
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
that
ellie
s
no
judge
of
tobacco
and
that
nick
s
too
far
gone
in
bliss
to
care
what
he
smokes
strefford
grumbled
stretching
a
hand
toward
his
host
s
i
do
like
jewellery
best
clarissa
murmured
hugging
her
father
nelson
vanderlyn
s
first
word
to
his
wife
had
been
that
he
had
brought
her
all
her
toggery
and
she
had
welcomed
him
with
appropriate
enthusiasm
in
fact
to
the
her
joy
at
seeing
him
seemed
rather
too
patently
in
proportion
to
her
satisfaction
at
getting
her
clothes
but
no
such
suspicion
appeared
to
mar
vanderlyn
s
happiness
in
being
for
once
and
for
nearly
hours
under
the
same
roof
with
his
wife
and
child
he
did
not
conceal
his
regret
at
having
promised
his
mother
to
join
her
the
next
day
and
added
with
a
wistful
glance
at
ellie
if
only
i
d
known
you
meant
to
wait
for
me
but
being
a
man
of
duty
in
domestic
as
well
as
business
affairs
he
did
not
even
consider
the
possibility
of
disappointing
the
exacting
old
lady
to
whom
he
owed
his
being
mother
cares
for
so
few
people
he
used
to
say
not
without
a
touch
of
filial
pride
in
the
parental
exclusiveness
that
i
have
to
be
with
her
rather
more
than
if
she
were
more
sociable
and
with
smiling
resignation
he
gave
orders
that
clarissa
should
be
ready
to
start
the
next
evening
and
meanwhile
he
concluded
we
ll
have
all
the
good
time
that
s
the
ladies
of
the
party
seemed
united
in
the
desire
to
further
this
resolve
and
it
was
settled
that
as
soon
as
vanderlyn
had
despatched
a
hasty
luncheon
his
wife
clarissa
and
susy
should
carry
him
off
for
a
at
torcello
they
did
not
even
suggest
that
strefford
or
nick
should
be
of
the
party
or
that
any
of
the
other
young
men
of
the
group
should
be
summoned
as
susy
said
nelson
wanted
to
go
off
alone
with
his
harem
and
lansing
and
strefford
were
left
to
watch
the
departure
of
the
happy
pasha
ensconced
between
attentive
beauties
well
that
s
what
you
call
being
married
strefford
commented
waving
his
battered
panama
at
clarissa
oh
no
i
don
t
lansing
laughed
he
does
but
do
you
know
strefford
paused
and
swung
about
on
his
companion
do
you
know
when
the
rude
awakening
comes
i
don
t
care
to
be
there
i
believe
there
ll
be
some
crockery
shouldn
t
wonder
lansing
answered
indifferently
he
wandered
away
to
his
own
room
leaving
strefford
to
philosophize
to
his
pipe
lansing
had
always
known
about
poor
old
nelson
who
hadn
t
except
poor
old
nelson
the
case
had
once
seemed
amusing
because
so
typical
now
it
rather
irritated
nick
that
vanderlyn
should
be
so
complete
an
ass
but
he
would
be
off
the
next
day
and
so
would
ellie
and
then
for
many
enchanted
weeks
the
palace
would
once
more
be
the
property
of
nick
and
susy
of
all
the
people
who
came
and
went
in
it
they
were
the
only
ones
who
appreciated
it
or
knew
how
it
was
meant
to
be
lived
in
and
that
made
it
theirs
in
the
only
valid
sense
in
this
light
it
became
easy
to
regard
the
vanderlyns
as
mere
transient
intruders
having
relegated
them
to
this
convenient
distance
lansing
shut
himself
up
with
his
book
he
had
returned
to
it
with
fresh
energy
after
his
few
weeks
of
and
was
determined
to
finish
it
quickly
he
did
not
expect
that
it
would
bring
in
much
money
but
if
it
were
moderately
successful
it
might
give
him
an
opening
in
the
reviews
and
magazines
and
in
that
case
he
meant
to
abandon
archaeology
for
novels
since
it
was
only
as
a
purveyor
of
fiction
that
he
could
count
on
earning
a
living
for
himself
and
susy
late
in
the
afternoon
he
laid
down
his
pen
and
wandered
out
of
doors
he
loved
the
increasing
heat
of
the
venetian
summer
the
bruised
of
worn
the
enamelling
of
sunlight
on
dark
green
canals
the
smell
of
fruits
and
flowers
thickening
the
languid
air
what
visions
he
could
build
if
he
dared
of
being
tucked
away
with
susy
in
the
attic
of
some
palace
above
a
waterway
with
a
terrace
overhanging
a
scrap
of
neglected
garden
and
cheques
from
the
publishers
dropping
in
at
convenient
intervals
why
should
they
not
settle
in
venice
if
he
pulled
it
off
he
found
himself
before
the
church
of
the
scalzi
and
pushing
open
the
leathern
door
wandered
up
the
nave
under
the
whirl
of
angels
in
tiepolo
s
great
vault
it
was
not
a
church
in
which
one
was
likely
to
run
across
but
he
presently
remarked
a
young
lady
standing
alone
near
the
choir
and
assiduously
applying
her
to
the
celestial
vortex
from
which
she
occasionally
glanced
down
at
an
open
manual
as
lansing
s
step
sounded
on
the
pavement
the
young
lady
turning
revealed
herself
as
miss
hicks
ah
you
like
this
too
it
s
several
centuries
out
of
your
line
though
isn
t
it
nick
asked
as
they
shook
hands
she
gazed
at
him
gravely
why
shouldn
t
one
like
things
that
are
out
of
one
s
line
she
answered
and
he
agreed
with
a
laugh
that
it
was
often
an
incentive
she
continued
to
fix
her
grave
eyes
on
him
and
after
one
or
two
remarks
about
the
tiepolos
he
perceived
that
she
was
feeling
her
way
toward
a
subject
of
more
personal
interest
i
m
glad
to
see
you
alone
she
said
at
length
with
an
abruptness
that
might
have
seemed
awkward
had
it
not
been
so
completely
unconscious
she
turned
toward
a
cluster
of
straw
chairs
and
signed
to
nick
to
seat
himself
beside
her
i
seldom
do
she
added
with
the
serious
smile
that
made
her
heavy
face
almost
handsome
and
she
went
on
giving
him
no
time
to
protest
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
to
explain
about
father
s
invitation
to
go
with
us
to
persia
and
to
explain
yes
you
found
the
letter
when
you
arrived
here
just
after
your
marriage
didn
t
you
you
must
have
thought
it
odd
our
asking
you
just
then
but
we
hadn
t
heard
that
you
were
oh
i
guessed
as
much
it
happened
very
quietly
and
i
was
remiss
about
announcing
it
even
to
old
lansing
frowned
his
thoughts
had
wandered
away
to
the
evening
when
he
had
found
hicks
s
letter
in
the
mail
awaiting
him
at
venice
the
day
was
associated
in
his
mind
with
the
ridiculous
and
mortifying
episode
of
the
cigars
the
expensive
cigars
that
susy
had
wanted
to
carry
away
from
strefford
s
villa
their
brief
exchange
of
views
on
the
subject
had
left
the
first
blur
on
the
perfect
surface
of
his
happiness
and
he
still
felt
an
uncomfortable
heat
at
the
remembrance
for
a
few
hours
the
prospect
of
life
with
susy
had
seemed
unendurable
and
it
was
just
at
that
moment
that
he
had
found
the
letter
from
hicks
with
its
almost
irresistible
invitation
if
only
her
daughter
had
known
how
nearly
he
had
accepted
it
it
was
a
dreadful
temptation
he
said
smiling
to
go
with
us
then
why
oh
everything
s
different
now
i
ve
got
to
stick
to
my
miss
hicks
still
bent
on
him
the
same
unblinking
scrutiny
does
that
mean
that
you
re
going
to
give
up
your
real
work
my
real
work
archaeology
he
smiled
again
to
hide
a
twitch
of
regret
why
i
m
afraid
it
hardly
produces
a
living
wage
and
i
ve
got
to
think
of
he
coloured
suddenly
as
if
suspecting
that
miss
hicks
might
consider
the
avowal
an
opening
for
he
hardly
knew
what
ponderous
offer
of
aid
the
hicks
munificence
was
too
uncalculating
not
to
be
occasionally
oppressive
but
looking
at
her
again
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
i
thought
it
was
your
vocation
she
said
so
did
i
but
life
comes
along
and
upsets
oh
i
understand
there
may
be
things
worth
giving
up
all
other
things
there
are
cried
nick
with
beaming
emphasis
he
was
conscious
that
miss
hicks
s
eyes
demanded
of
him
even
more
than
this
sweeping
affirmation
but
your
novel
may
fail
she
said
with
her
odd
harshness
it
may
it
probably
will
he
agreed
but
if
one
stopped
to
consider
such
possibilities
don
t
you
have
to
with
a
wife
oh
my
dear
coral
how
old
are
you
not
twenty
he
questioned
laying
a
brotherly
hand
on
hers
she
stared
at
him
a
moment
and
sprang
up
clumsily
from
her
chair
i
was
never
young
if
that
s
what
you
mean
it
s
lucky
isn
t
it
that
my
parents
gave
me
such
a
grand
education
because
you
see
art
s
a
wonderful
she
pronounced
it
he
continued
to
look
at
her
kindly
you
won
t
need
it
or
any
other
when
you
grow
young
as
you
will
some
day
he
assured
her
do
you
mean
when
i
fall
in
love
but
i
am
in
love
oh
there
s
eldorada
and
beck
she
broke
off
with
a
jerk
signalling
with
her
to
the
pair
who
had
just
appeared
at
the
farther
end
of
the
nave
i
told
them
that
if
they
d
meet
me
here
i
d
try
to
make
them
understand
tiepolo
because
you
see
at
home
we
never
really
have
understood
tiepolo
and
beck
and
eldorada
are
the
only
ones
to
realize
it
buttles
simply
won
she
turned
to
lansing
and
held
out
her
hand
i
am
in
love
she
repeated
earnestly
and
that
s
the
reason
why
i
find
art
such
a
re
she
restored
her
opened
her
manual
and
strode
across
the
church
to
the
expectant
neophytes
lansing
looking
after
her
wondered
for
half
a
moment
whether
beck
were
the
object
of
this
apparently
unrequited
sentiment
then
with
a
queer
start
of
introspection
abruptly
decided
that
no
he
certainly
was
not
but
then
but
then
well
there
was
no
use
in
following
up
such
conjectures
he
turned
wondering
if
the
picnickers
had
already
reached
palazzo
vanderlyn
they
got
back
only
in
time
for
a
late
dinner
full
of
chaff
and
laughter
and
apparently
still
enchanted
with
each
other
s
society
nelson
vanderlyn
beamed
on
his
wife
sent
his
daughter
off
to
bed
with
a
kiss
and
leaning
back
in
his
armchair
before
the
table
declared
that
he
d
never
spent
a
jollier
day
in
his
life
susy
seemed
to
come
in
for
a
full
share
of
his
approbation
and
lansing
thought
that
ellie
was
unusually
demonstrative
to
her
friend
strefford
from
his
hostess
s
side
glanced
across
now
and
then
at
young
lansing
and
his
glance
seemed
to
lansing
a
confidential
comment
on
the
vanderlyn
raptures
but
then
strefford
was
always
having
private
jokes
with
people
or
about
them
and
lansing
was
irritated
with
himself
for
perpetually
suspecting
his
best
friends
of
vague
complicities
at
his
expense
if
i
m
going
to
be
jealous
of
streffy
now
he
concluded
with
a
grimace
of
certainly
susy
looked
lovely
enough
to
justify
the
most
irrational
pangs
as
a
girl
she
had
been
for
some
people
s
taste
a
trifle
and
now
to
her
old
lightness
of
line
was
added
a
shadowy
bloom
a
sort
of
depth
her
movements
were
slower
less
angular
her
mouth
had
a
needing
droop
her
lids
seemed
weighed
down
by
their
lashes
and
then
suddenly
the
old
spirit
would
reveal
itself
through
the
new
languor
like
the
tartness
at
the
core
of
a
sweet
fruit
as
her
husband
looked
at
her
across
the
flowers
and
lights
he
laughed
inwardly
at
the
nothingness
of
all
things
else
vanderlyn
and
clarissa
left
betimes
the
next
morning
and
vanderlyn
who
was
to
start
for
moritz
in
the
afternoon
devoted
her
last
hours
to
anxious
conferences
with
her
maid
and
susy
strefford
with
fred
gillow
and
the
others
had
gone
for
a
swim
at
the
lido
and
lansing
seized
the
opportunity
to
get
back
to
his
book
the
quietness
of
the
great
echoing
place
gave
him
a
foretaste
of
the
solitude
to
come
by
all
their
party
would
be
scattered
the
hickses
off
on
a
cruise
to
crete
and
the
aegean
fred
gillow
on
the
way
to
his
moor
strefford
to
stay
with
friends
in
capri
till
his
annual
visit
to
northumberland
in
september
one
by
one
the
others
would
follow
and
lansing
and
susy
be
left
alone
in
the
great
palace
alone
under
the
skies
alone
with
the
great
orange
moons
still
theirs
above
the
of
san
giorgio
the
novel
in
that
blessed
quiet
would
unfold
itself
as
harmoniously
as
his
dreams
he
wrote
on
forgetful
of
the
passing
hours
till
the
door
opened
and
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
the
next
moment
two
hands
were
clasped
over
his
eyes
and
the
air
was
full
of
vanderlyn
s
last
new
scent
you
dear
thing
i
m
just
off
you
know
she
said
susy
told
me
you
were
working
and
i
forbade
her
to
call
you
down
she
and
streffy
are
waiting
to
take
me
to
the
station
and
i
ve
run
up
to
say
ellie
dear
full
of
compunction
lansing
pushed
aside
his
writing
and
started
up
but
she
pressed
him
back
into
his
seat
no
no
i
should
never
forgive
myself
if
i
d
interrupted
you
i
oughtn
t
to
have
come
up
susy
didn
t
want
me
to
but
i
had
to
tell
you
you
dear
i
had
to
thank
you
in
her
dark
travelling
dress
and
hat
so
discreetly
conspicuous
so
negligent
and
so
studied
with
a
veil
masking
her
paint
and
gloves
hiding
her
rings
she
looked
younger
simpler
more
natural
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
poor
ellie
such
a
good
fellow
after
all
to
thank
me
for
what
for
being
so
happy
here
he
laughed
taking
her
hands
she
looked
at
him
laughed
back
and
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
for
helping
me
to
be
so
happy
elsewhere
you
and
susy
you
two
blessed
darlings
she
cried
with
a
kiss
on
his
cheek
their
eyes
met
for
a
second
then
her
arms
slipped
slowly
downward
dropping
to
her
sides
lansing
sat
before
her
like
a
stone
oh
she
gasped
why
do
you
stare
so
didn
t
you
know
they
heard
strefford
s
shrill
voice
on
the
stairs
ellie
where
the
deuce
are
you
susy
s
in
the
gondola
you
ll
miss
the
train
lansing
stood
up
and
caught
vanderlyn
by
the
wrist
what
do
you
mean
what
are
you
talking
about
oh
nothing
but
you
were
both
such
bricks
about
the
letters
and
when
nelson
was
here
too
nick
don
t
hurt
my
wrist
so
i
must
run
he
dropped
her
hand
and
stood
motionless
staring
after
her
and
listening
to
the
click
of
her
high
heels
as
she
fled
across
the
room
and
along
the
echoing
corridor
when
he
turned
back
to
the
table
he
noticed
that
a
small
morocco
case
had
fallen
among
his
papers
in
falling
it
had
opened
and
before
him
on
the
pale
velvet
lining
lay
a
set
with
a
perfect
pearl
he
picked
the
box
up
and
was
about
to
hasten
after
vanderlyn
it
was
so
like
her
to
shed
jewels
on
her
path
when
he
noticed
his
own
initials
on
the
cover
he
dropped
the
box
as
if
it
had
been
a
hot
coal
and
sat
for
a
long
while
gazing
at
the
gold
which
seemed
to
have
burnt
itself
into
his
flesh
at
last
he
roused
himself
and
stood
up
x
with
a
sigh
of
relief
susy
drew
the
pins
from
her
hat
and
threw
herself
down
on
the
lounge
the
ordeal
she
had
dreaded
was
over
and
and
vanderlyn
had
safely
gone
their
several
ways
poor
ellie
was
not
noted
for
prudence
and
when
life
smiled
on
her
she
was
given
to
betraying
her
gratitude
too
openly
but
thanks
to
susy
s
vigilance
and
no
doubt
to
strefford
s
tacit
the
dreaded
hours
were
happily
over
nelson
vanderlyn
had
departed
without
a
shadow
on
his
brow
and
though
ellie
s
when
she
came
down
from
bidding
nick
had
seemed
to
susy
less
serene
than
usual
she
became
her
normal
self
as
soon
as
it
was
discovered
that
the
red
morocco
bag
with
her
was
missing
before
it
had
been
discovered
in
the
depths
of
the
gondola
they
had
reached
the
station
and
there
was
just
time
to
thrust
her
into
her
sleeper
from
which
she
was
seen
to
wave
an
unperturbed
farewell
to
her
friends
well
my
dear
we
ve
been
it
through
strefford
remarked
with
a
deep
breath
as
the
moritz
express
rolled
away
oh
susy
sighed
in
mute
complicity
then
as
if
to
cover
her
poor
darling
she
does
so
like
what
she
likes
yes
even
if
it
s
a
rotten
bounder
strefford
agreed
a
rotten
bounder
why
i
thought
that
it
was
still
young
davenant
lord
no
not
for
the
last
six
months
didn
t
she
tell
you
susy
felt
herself
redden
i
didn
t
ask
her
ask
her
you
mean
you
didn
t
let
her
i
didn
t
let
her
and
i
don
t
let
you
susy
added
sharply
as
he
helped
her
into
the
gondola
oh
all
right
i
daresay
you
re
right
it
simplifies
things
strefford
placidly
acquiesced
she
made
no
answer
and
in
silence
they
glided
homeward
now
in
the
quiet
of
her
own
room
susy
lay
and
pondered
on
the
distance
she
had
travelled
during
the
last
year
strefford
had
read
her
mind
with
his
usual
penetration
it
was
true
that
there
had
been
a
time
when
she
would
have
thought
it
perfectly
natural
that
ellie
should
tell
her
everything
that
the
name
of
young
davenant
s
successor
should
be
confided
to
her
as
a
matter
of
course
apparently
even
ellie
had
been
obscurely
aware
of
the
change
for
after
a
first
attempt
to
force
her
confidences
on
susy
she
had
contented
herself
with
vague
expressions
of
gratitude
allusive
smiles
and
sighs
and
the
pretty
surprise
of
the
sapphire
bangle
slipped
onto
her
friend
s
wrist
in
the
act
of
their
farewell
embrace
the
bangle
was
extremely
handsome
susy
who
had
an
auctioneer
s
eye
for
values
knew
to
a
fraction
the
worth
of
those
deep
convex
stones
alternating
with
small
emeralds
and
brilliants
she
was
glad
to
own
the
bracelet
and
enchanted
with
the
effect
it
produced
on
her
slim
wrist
yet
even
while
admiring
it
and
rejoicing
that
it
was
hers
she
had
already
transmuted
it
into
specie
and
reckoned
just
how
far
it
would
go
toward
the
paying
of
domestic
necessities
for
whatever
came
to
her
now
interested
her
only
as
something
more
to
be
offered
up
to
nick
the
door
opened
and
nick
came
in
dusk
had
fallen
and
she
could
not
see
his
face
but
something
in
the
jerk
of
the
roused
her
apprehension
she
hurried
toward
him
with
outstretched
wrist
look
dearest
wasn
t
it
too
darling
of
ellie
she
pressed
the
button
of
the
lamp
that
lit
her
and
her
husband
s
face
started
unfamiliarly
out
of
the
twilight
she
slipped
off
the
bracelet
and
held
it
up
to
him
oh
i
can
go
you
one
better
he
said
with
a
laugh
and
pulling
a
morocco
case
from
his
pocket
he
flung
it
down
among
the
susy
opened
the
case
automatically
staring
at
the
pearl
because
she
was
afraid
to
look
again
at
nick
ellie
gave
you
this
she
asked
at
length
yes
she
gave
me
there
was
a
pause
would
you
mind
telling
me
lansing
continued
in
the
same
tone
exactly
for
what
services
we
ve
both
been
so
handsomely
paid
the
pearl
is
beautiful
susy
murmured
to
gain
time
while
her
head
spun
round
with
unimaginable
terrors
so
are
your
sapphires
though
on
closer
examination
my
services
would
appear
to
have
been
valued
rather
higher
than
yours
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
just
what
they
were
susy
threw
her
head
back
and
looked
at
him
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
nick
why
shouldn
t
ellie
have
given
us
these
things
do
you
forget
that
it
s
like
our
giving
her
a
or
a
what
is
it
you
are
trying
to
suggest
it
had
cost
her
a
considerable
effort
to
hold
his
eyes
while
she
put
the
questions
something
had
happened
between
him
and
ellie
that
was
evident
one
of
those
hideous
unforeseeable
blunders
that
may
cause
one
s
cleverest
plans
to
crumble
at
a
stroke
and
again
susy
shuddered
at
the
frailty
of
her
bliss
but
her
old
training
stood
her
in
good
stead
there
had
been
more
than
one
moment
in
her
past
when
everything
somebody
else
s
everything
had
depended
on
her
keeping
a
cool
head
and
a
clear
glance
it
would
have
been
a
wonder
if
now
when
she
felt
her
own
everything
at
stake
she
had
not
been
able
to
put
up
as
good
a
defence
what
is
it
she
repeated
impatiently
as
lansing
continued
to
remain
silent
that
s
what
i
m
here
to
ask
he
returned
keeping
his
eyes
as
steady
as
she
kept
hers
there
s
no
reason
on
earth
as
you
say
why
ellie
shouldn
t
give
us
presents
as
expensive
presents
as
she
likes
and
the
pearl
is
a
beauty
all
i
ask
is
for
what
specific
services
were
they
given
for
allowing
for
all
the
absence
of
scruple
that
marks
the
intercourse
of
truly
civilized
people
you
ll
probably
agree
that
there
are
limits
at
least
up
to
now
there
have
been
limits
i
really
don
t
know
what
you
mean
i
suppose
ellie
wanted
to
show
that
she
was
grateful
to
us
for
looking
after
but
she
gave
us
all
this
in
exchange
for
that
didn
t
she
he
suggested
with
a
sweep
of
the
hand
around
the
beautiful
shadowy
room
a
whole
summer
of
it
if
we
susy
smiled
apparently
she
didn
t
think
that
what
a
doting
mother
it
shows
the
store
she
sets
upon
her
well
don
t
you
set
store
upon
clarissa
clarissa
is
exquisite
but
her
mother
didn
t
mention
her
in
offering
me
this
susy
lifted
her
head
again
whom
did
she
mention
vanderlyn
said
lansing
vanderlyn
nelson
yes
and
some
letters
something
about
letters
what
is
it
my
dear
that
you
and
i
have
been
hired
to
hide
from
vanderlyn
because
i
should
like
to
know
nick
broke
out
savagely
if
we
ve
been
adequately
susy
was
silent
she
needed
time
to
reckon
up
her
forces
and
study
her
next
move
and
her
brain
was
in
such
a
whirl
of
fear
that
she
could
at
last
only
retort
what
is
it
that
ellie
said
to
you
lansing
laughed
again
that
s
just
what
you
d
like
to
find
out
isn
t
it
in
order
to
know
the
line
to
take
in
making
your
the
sneer
had
an
effect
that
he
could
not
have
foreseen
and
that
susy
herself
had
not
expected
oh
don
t
don
t
let
us
speak
to
each
other
like
that
she
cried
and
sinking
down
by
the
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
it
seemed
to
her
now
that
nothing
mattered
except
that
their
love
for
each
other
their
faith
in
each
other
should
be
saved
from
some
unhealable
hurt
she
was
willing
to
tell
nick
everything
she
wanted
to
tell
him
everything
if
only
she
could
be
sure
of
reaching
a
responsive
chord
in
him
but
the
scene
of
the
cigars
came
back
to
her
and
benumbed
her
if
only
she
could
make
him
see
that
nothing
was
of
any
account
as
long
as
they
continued
to
love
each
other
his
touch
fell
compassionately
on
her
shoulder
poor
child
don
t
he
said
their
eyes
met
but
his
expression
checked
the
smile
breaking
through
her
tears
don
t
you
see
he
continued
that
we
ve
got
to
have
this
thing
out
she
continued
to
stare
at
him
through
a
prism
of
tears
i
can
t
while
you
stand
up
like
that
she
stammered
childishly
she
had
cowered
down
again
into
a
corner
of
the
lounge
but
lansing
did
not
seat
himself
at
her
side
he
took
a
chair
facing
her
like
a
caller
on
the
farther
side
of
a
stately
will
that
do
he
asked
with
a
stiff
smile
as
if
to
humour
her
nothing
will
do
as
long
as
you
re
not
you
not
me
she
shook
her
head
wearily
what
s
the
use
you
accept
things
theoretically
and
then
when
they
happen
what
things
what
has
happened
a
sudden
impatience
mastered
her
what
did
he
suppose
after
all
but
you
know
all
about
ellie
we
used
to
talk
about
her
often
enough
in
old
times
she
said
ellie
and
young
davenant
young
davenant
or
the
others
or
the
others
but
what
business
was
it
of
ours
ah
that
s
just
what
i
think
she
cried
springing
up
with
an
explosion
of
relief
lansing
stood
up
also
but
there
was
no
answering
light
in
his
face
we
re
outside
of
all
that
we
ve
nothing
to
do
with
it
have
we
he
pursued
nothing
then
what
on
earth
is
the
meaning
of
ellie
s
gratitude
gratitude
for
what
we
ve
done
about
some
letters
and
about
vanderlyn
oh
not
you
susy
cried
involuntarily
not
i
then
you
he
came
close
and
took
her
by
the
wrist
answer
me
have
you
been
mixed
up
in
some
dirty
business
of
ellie
s
there
was
a
pause
she
found
it
impossible
to
speak
with
that
burning
grasp
on
the
wrist
where
the
bangle
had
been
at
length
he
let
her
go
and
moved
away
answer
he
repeated
i
ve
told
you
it
was
my
business
and
not
he
received
this
in
silence
then
he
questioned
you
ve
been
sending
letters
for
her
i
suppose
to
whom
oh
why
do
you
torment
me
nelson
was
not
supposed
to
know
that
she
d
been
away
she
left
me
the
letters
to
post
to
him
once
a
week
i
found
them
here
the
night
we
arrived
it
was
the
price
for
this
oh
nick
say
it
s
been
worth
it
say
at
least
that
it
s
been
worth
it
she
implored
him
he
stood
motionless
unresponding
one
hand
drummed
on
the
corner
of
her
making
the
jewelled
bangle
dance
how
many
letters
i
don
t
know
four
five
what
does
it
matter
and
once
a
week
for
six
weeks
and
you
took
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
no
i
hated
it
but
what
could
i
do
what
could
you
do
when
our
being
together
depended
on
it
oh
nick
how
could
you
think
i
d
give
you
up
give
me
up
he
echoed
well
doesn
t
our
being
together
depend
on
on
what
we
can
get
out
of
people
and
hasn
t
there
always
got
to
be
some
did
you
ever
in
your
life
get
anything
for
nothing
she
cried
with
sudden
exasperation
you
ve
lived
among
these
people
as
long
as
i
have
i
suppose
it
s
not
the
first
time
by
god
but
it
is
he
exclaimed
flushing
and
that
s
the
difference
the
fundamental
the
difference
between
you
and
me
i
ve
never
in
my
life
done
people
s
dirty
work
for
them
least
of
all
for
favours
in
return
i
suppose
you
guessed
it
or
you
wouldn
t
have
hidden
this
beastly
business
from
the
blood
rose
to
susy
s
temples
also
yes
she
had
guessed
it
instinctively
from
the
day
she
had
first
visited
him
in
his
bare
lodgings
she
had
been
aware
of
his
stricter
standard
but
how
could
she
tell
him
that
under
his
influence
her
standard
had
become
stricter
too
and
that
it
was
as
much
to
hide
her
humiliation
from
herself
as
to
escape
his
anger
that
she
had
held
her
tongue
you
knew
i
wouldn
t
have
stayed
here
another
day
if
i
d
known
he
continued
yes
and
then
where
in
the
world
should
we
have
gone
you
mean
that
in
one
way
or
another
what
you
call
is
the
price
of
our
remaining
together
well
isn
t
it
she
faltered
then
we
d
better
part
hadn
t
we
he
spoke
in
a
low
tone
thoughtfully
and
deliberately
as
if
this
had
been
the
inevitable
conclusion
to
which
their
passionate
argument
had
led
susy
made
no
answer
for
a
moment
she
ceased
to
be
conscious
of
the
causes
of
what
had
happened
the
thing
itself
seemed
to
have
smothered
her
under
its
ruins
nick
wandered
away
from
the
and
stood
gazing
out
of
the
window
at
the
darkening
canal
flecked
with
lights
she
looked
at
his
back
and
wondered
what
would
happen
if
she
were
to
go
up
to
him
and
fling
her
arms
about
him
but
even
if
her
touch
could
have
broken
the
spell
she
was
not
sure
she
would
have
chosen
that
way
of
breaking
it
beneath
her
speechless
anguish
there
burned
the
sense
of
having
been
unfairly
treated
when
they
had
entered
into
their
queer
compact
nick
had
known
as
well
as
she
on
what
compromises
and
concessions
the
life
they
were
to
live
together
must
be
based
that
he
should
have
forgotten
it
seemed
so
unbelievable
that
she
wondered
with
a
new
leap
of
fear
if
he
were
using
the
wretched
ellie
s
indiscretion
as
a
means
of
escape
from
a
tie
already
wearied
of
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
with
a
laugh
after
all
you
were
right
when
you
wanted
me
to
be
your
he
turned
on
her
with
an
astonished
stare
you
my
mistress
through
all
her
pain
she
thrilled
with
pride
at
the
discovery
that
such
a
possibility
had
long
since
become
unthinkable
to
him
but
she
insisted
that
day
at
the
fulmers
have
you
forgotten
when
you
said
it
would
be
sheer
madness
for
us
to
lansing
stood
leaning
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
mosaic
volutes
of
the
floor
i
was
right
enough
when
i
said
it
would
be
sheer
madness
for
us
to
marry
he
rejoined
at
length
she
sprang
up
trembling
well
that
s
easily
settled
our
compact
oh
that
compact
he
interrupted
her
with
an
impatient
laugh
aren
t
you
asking
me
to
carry
it
out
now
because
i
said
we
d
better
part
he
paused
but
the
compact
i
d
almost
forgotten
it
was
to
the
effect
wasn
t
it
that
we
were
to
give
each
other
a
helping
hand
if
either
of
us
had
a
better
chance
the
thing
was
absurd
of
course
a
mere
joke
from
my
point
of
view
at
least
i
shall
never
want
any
better
chance
any
other
chance
oh
nick
oh
nick
but
then
she
was
close
to
him
his
face
looming
down
through
her
tears
but
he
put
her
back
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
wouldn
t
it
he
rejoined
if
we
d
been
as
detachable
as
all
that
as
it
is
it
s
going
to
hurt
horribly
but
talking
it
over
won
t
help
you
were
right
just
now
when
you
asked
how
else
we
were
going
to
live
we
re
born
parasites
both
i
suppose
or
we
d
have
found
out
some
way
long
ago
but
i
find
there
are
things
i
might
put
up
with
for
myself
at
a
pinch
and
should
probably
in
time
that
i
can
t
let
you
put
up
with
for
me
ever
those
cigars
at
como
do
you
suppose
i
didn
t
know
it
was
for
me
and
this
too
well
it
won
t
do
it
won
t
do
he
stopped
as
if
his
courage
failed
him
and
she
moaned
out
but
your
writing
if
your
book
s
a
success
my
poor
susy
that
s
all
part
of
the
humbug
we
both
know
that
my
sort
of
writing
will
never
pay
and
what
s
the
alternative
except
more
of
the
same
kind
of
baseness
and
getting
more
and
more
blunted
to
it
at
least
till
now
i
ve
minded
certain
things
i
don
t
want
to
go
on
till
i
find
myself
taking
them
for
she
reached
out
a
timid
hand
but
you
needn
t
ever
dear
if
you
d
only
leave
it
to
me
he
drew
back
sharply
that
seems
simple
to
you
i
suppose
well
men
are
he
walked
toward
the
and
glanced
at
the
little
enamelled
clock
which
had
been
one
of
her
time
to
dress
isn
t
it
shall
you
mind
if
i
leave
you
to
dine
with
streffy
and
whoever
else
is
coming
i
d
rather
like
a
long
tramp
and
no
more
talking
just
at
present
except
with
he
passed
her
by
and
walked
rapidly
out
of
the
room
susy
stood
motionless
unable
to
lift
a
detaining
hand
or
to
find
a
final
word
of
appeal
on
her
disordered
vanderlyn
s
gifts
glittered
in
the
rosy
yes
men
were
different
as
he
said
xi
but
there
were
necessary
accommodations
there
always
had
been
nick
in
old
times
had
been
the
first
to
own
it
how
they
had
laughed
at
the
perpendicular
people
the
people
who
went
by
on
the
other
side
since
you
couldn
t
be
a
good
samaritan
without
stooping
over
and
poking
into
heaps
of
you
didn
t
know
what
and
now
nick
had
suddenly
become
perpendicular
susy
that
evening
at
the
head
of
the
dinner
table
saw
in
the
breaks
between
her
scudding
thoughts
the
nauseatingly
familiar
faces
of
the
people
she
called
her
friends
strefford
fred
gillow
a
giggling
fool
of
a
young
breckenridge
of
their
new
york
group
who
had
arrived
that
day
and
prince
nerone
altineri
ursula
s
prince
who
in
ursula
s
absence
at
a
tiresome
cure
had
quite
simply
and
naturally
preferred
to
join
her
husband
at
venice
susy
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
as
if
with
eyes
and
wondered
what
life
would
be
like
with
no
faces
but
such
as
theirs
to
furnish
it
ah
nick
had
become
perpendicular
after
all
most
people
went
through
life
making
a
given
set
of
gestures
like
learned
in
advance
if
your
dancing
manual
told
you
at
a
given
time
to
be
perpendicular
you
had
to
be
automatically
and
that
was
nick
but
what
on
earth
susy
gillow
s
puzzled
voice
suddenly
came
to
her
as
from
immeasurable
distances
are
you
going
to
do
in
this
beastly
stifling
hole
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
ask
nick
my
dear
fellow
strefford
answered
for
her
and
by
the
way
where
is
nick
if
one
may
ask
young
breckenridge
interposed
glancing
up
to
take
belated
note
of
his
host
s
absence
dining
out
said
susy
glibly
people
turned
up
blighting
bores
that
i
wouldn
t
have
dared
to
inflict
on
how
easily
the
old
familiar
fibbing
came
to
her
the
kind
to
whom
you
say
now
mind
you
look
me
up
and
then
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
our
good
hickses
strefford
amplified
the
hickses
but
of
course
nick
was
with
the
hickses
it
went
through
susy
like
a
knife
and
the
dinner
she
had
so
lightly
fibbed
became
a
hateful
truth
she
said
to
herself
feverishly
i
ll
call
him
up
there
after
dinner
and
then
he
will
feel
silly
but
only
to
remember
that
the
hickses
in
their
mediaeval
setting
had
of
course
sternly
denied
themselves
a
telephone
the
fact
of
nick
s
temporary
inaccessibility
since
she
was
now
convinced
that
he
was
really
at
the
hickses
turned
her
distress
to
a
mocking
irritation
ah
that
was
where
he
carried
his
principles
his
standards
or
whatever
he
called
the
new
set
of
rules
he
had
suddenly
begun
to
apply
to
the
old
game
it
was
stupid
of
her
not
to
have
guessed
it
at
once
oh
the
hickses
nick
adores
them
you
know
he
s
going
to
marry
coral
next
she
laughed
out
flashing
the
joke
around
the
table
with
all
her
practiced
flippancy
lord
grasped
gillow
inarticulate
while
the
prince
displayed
the
unsurprised
smile
which
susy
accused
him
of
practicing
every
morning
with
his
mueller
exercises
suddenly
susy
felt
strefford
s
eyes
upon
her
what
s
the
matter
with
me
too
much
rouge
she
asked
passing
her
arm
in
his
as
they
left
the
table
no
too
little
look
at
yourself
he
answered
in
a
low
tone
oh
in
these
cadaverous
old
looks
fished
up
from
the
canal
she
jerked
away
from
him
to
spin
down
the
long
floor
of
the
sala
hands
on
hips
whistling
a
tune
the
prince
and
young
breckenridge
caught
her
up
and
she
spun
back
with
the
latter
while
gillow
it
was
believed
to
be
his
sole
accomplishment
snapped
his
fingers
in
simulation
of
bones
and
shuffled
after
the
couple
on
stamping
feet
susy
sank
down
on
a
sofa
near
the
window
fanning
herself
with
a
floating
scarf
and
the
men
foraged
for
cigarettes
and
rang
for
the
gondoliers
who
came
in
with
trays
of
cooling
drinks
well
what
next
this
ain
t
all
is
it
gillow
presently
queried
from
the
divan
where
he
lolled
with
dripping
brow
fred
gillow
like
nature
abhorred
a
void
and
it
was
inconceivable
to
him
that
every
hour
of
man
s
rational
existence
should
not
furnish
a
motive
for
getting
up
and
going
somewhere
else
young
breckenridge
who
took
the
same
view
and
the
prince
who
earnestly
desired
to
reminded
the
company
that
somebody
they
knew
was
giving
a
dance
that
night
at
the
lido
strefford
vetoed
the
lido
on
the
ground
that
he
d
just
come
back
from
there
and
proposed
that
they
should
go
out
on
foot
for
a
change
why
not
what
fun
susy
was
up
in
an
instant
let
s
pay
somebody
a
surprise
visit
i
don
t
know
who
streffy
prince
can
t
you
think
of
somebody
who
d
be
particularly
annoyed
by
our
arrival
oh
the
list
s
too
long
let
s
start
and
choose
our
victim
on
the
way
strefford
suggested
susy
ran
to
her
room
for
a
light
cloak
and
without
changing
her
satin
slippers
went
out
with
the
four
men
there
was
no
moon
thank
heaven
there
was
no
moon
but
the
stars
hung
over
them
as
close
as
fruit
and
secret
fragrances
dropped
on
them
from
susy
s
heart
tightened
with
memories
of
como
they
wandered
on
laughing
and
dawdling
and
yielding
to
the
drifting
whims
of
aimless
people
presently
someone
proposed
taking
a
nearer
look
at
the
facade
of
san
giorgio
maggiore
and
they
hailed
a
gondola
and
were
rowed
out
through
the
bobbing
lanterns
and
twanging
when
they
landed
again
gillow
always
acutely
bored
by
scenery
and
particularly
resentful
of
midnight
aesthetics
suggested
a
night
club
near
at
hand
which
was
said
to
be
jolly
the
prince
warmly
supported
this
proposal
but
on
susy
s
curt
refusal
they
started
their
rambling
again
circuitously
threading
the
vague
dark
lanes
and
making
for
the
piazza
and
florian
s
ices
suddenly
at
a
unfamiliar
and
yet
somehow
known
to
her
susy
paused
to
stare
about
her
with
a
laugh
but
the
hickses
surely
that
s
their
palace
and
the
windows
all
lit
up
they
must
be
giving
a
party
oh
do
let
s
go
up
and
surprise
them
the
idea
struck
her
as
one
of
the
drollest
that
she
had
ever
originated
and
she
wondered
that
her
companions
should
respond
so
languidly
i
can
t
see
anything
very
thrilling
in
surprising
the
hickses
gillow
protested
defrauded
of
possible
excitements
and
strefford
added
it
would
surprise
me
more
than
them
if
i
but
susy
insisted
feverishly
you
don
t
know
it
may
be
awfully
exciting
i
have
an
idea
that
coral
s
announcing
her
engagement
her
engagement
to
nick
come
give
me
a
hand
streff
and
you
the
other
she
began
to
hum
the
first
bars
of
donna
anna
s
entrance
in
don
giovanni
pity
i
haven
t
got
a
black
cloak
and
a
mask
oh
your
face
will
do
said
strefford
laying
his
hand
on
her
arm
she
drew
back
flushing
crimson
breckenridge
and
the
prince
had
sprung
on
ahead
and
gillow
lumbering
after
them
was
already
halfway
up
the
stairs
my
face
my
face
what
s
the
matter
with
my
face
do
you
know
any
reason
why
i
shouldn
t
go
to
the
hickses
susy
broke
out
in
sudden
wrath
none
whatever
except
that
if
you
do
it
will
bore
me
to
death
strefford
returned
with
serenity
oh
in
that
case
no
come
on
i
hear
those
fools
banging
on
the
door
he
caught
her
by
the
hand
and
they
started
up
the
stairway
but
on
the
first
landing
she
paused
twisted
her
hand
out
of
his
and
without
a
word
without
a
conscious
thought
dashed
down
the
long
flight
across
the
great
resounding
vestibule
and
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
calle
strefford
caught
up
with
her
and
they
stood
a
moment
silent
in
the
night
susy
what
the
devil
s
the
matter
the
matter
can
t
you
see
that
i
m
tired
that
i
ve
got
a
splitting
headache
that
you
bore
me
to
death
one
and
all
of
you
she
turned
and
laid
a
deprecating
hand
on
his
arm
streffy
old
dear
don
t
mind
me
but
for
god
s
sake
find
a
gondola
and
send
me
alone
it
was
never
any
concern
of
streff
s
if
people
wanted
to
do
things
he
did
not
understand
and
she
knew
that
she
could
count
on
his
obedience
they
walked
on
in
silence
to
the
next
canal
and
he
picked
up
a
passing
gondola
and
put
her
in
it
now
go
and
amuse
yourself
she
called
after
him
as
the
boat
shot
under
the
nearest
bridge
anything
anything
to
be
alone
away
from
the
folly
and
futility
that
would
be
all
she
had
left
if
nick
were
to
drop
out
of
her
life
but
perhaps
he
has
dropped
already
dropped
for
good
she
thought
as
she
set
her
foot
on
the
vanderlyn
threshold
the
short
summer
night
was
already
growing
transparent
a
new
born
breeze
stirred
the
soiled
surface
of
the
water
and
sent
it
lapping
freshly
against
the
old
palace
doorways
nearly
two
o
clock
nick
had
no
doubt
come
back
long
ago
susy
hurried
up
the
stairs
reassured
by
the
mere
thought
of
his
nearness
she
knew
that
when
their
eyes
and
their
lips
met
it
would
be
impossible
for
anything
to
keep
them
apart
the
gondolier
dozing
on
the
landing
roused
himself
to
receive
her
and
to
proffer
two
envelopes
the
upper
one
was
a
telegram
for
strefford
she
threw
it
down
again
and
paused
under
the
lantern
hanging
from
the
painted
vault
the
other
envelope
in
her
hand
the
address
it
bore
was
in
nick
s
writing
when
did
the
signore
leave
this
for
me
has
he
gone
out
again
gone
out
again
but
the
signore
had
not
come
in
since
dinner
of
that
the
gondolier
was
positive
as
he
had
been
on
duty
all
the
evening
a
boy
had
brought
the
letter
an
unknown
boy
he
had
left
it
without
waiting
it
must
have
been
about
half
an
hour
after
the
signora
had
herself
gone
out
with
her
guests
susy
hardly
hearing
him
fled
on
to
her
own
room
and
there
beside
the
very
lamp
which
two
months
before
had
illuminated
ellie
vanderlyn
s
fatal
letter
she
opened
nick
s
don
t
think
me
hard
on
you
dear
but
i
ve
got
to
work
this
thing
out
by
myself
the
sooner
the
better
don
t
you
agree
so
i
m
taking
the
express
to
milan
presently
you
ll
get
a
proper
letter
in
a
day
or
two
i
wish
i
could
think
now
of
something
to
say
that
would
show
you
i
m
not
a
brute
but
i
can
t
there
was
not
much
of
the
night
left
in
which
to
sleep
even
had
a
semblance
of
sleep
been
achievable
the
letter
fell
from
susy
s
hands
and
she
crept
out
onto
the
balcony
and
cowered
there
her
forehead
pressed
against
the
balustrade
the
dawn
wind
stirring
in
her
thin
laces
through
her
closed
eyelids
and
the
fingers
pressed
against
them
she
felt
the
penetration
of
the
growing
light
the
relentless
advance
of
another
day
a
day
without
purpose
and
without
meaning
a
day
without
nick
at
length
she
dropped
her
hands
and
staring
from
dry
lids
saw
a
rim
of
fire
above
the
roofs
across
the
grand
canal
she
sprang
up
ran
back
into
her
room
and
dragging
the
heavy
curtains
shut
across
the
windows
stumbled
over
in
the
darkness
to
the
lounge
and
fell
among
its
downward
groping
delving
for
a
deeper
night
she
started
up
stiff
and
aching
to
see
a
golden
wedge
of
sun
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
she
had
slept
then
was
it
possible
it
must
be
eight
or
nine
o
clock
already
she
had
slept
slept
like
a
drunkard
with
that
letter
on
the
table
at
her
elbow
ah
now
she
remembered
she
had
dreamed
that
the
letter
was
a
dream
but
there
inexorably
it
lay
and
she
picked
it
up
and
slowly
painfully
it
then
she
tore
it
into
shreds
hunted
for
a
match
and
kneeling
before
the
empty
hearth
as
though
she
were
accomplishing
some
funeral
rite
she
burnt
every
shred
of
it
to
ashes
nick
would
thank
her
for
that
some
day
after
a
bath
and
a
hurried
toilet
she
began
to
be
aware
of
feeling
younger
and
more
hopeful
after
all
nick
had
merely
said
that
he
was
going
away
for
a
day
or
and
the
letter
was
not
cruel
there
were
tender
things
in
it
showing
through
the
curt
words
she
smiled
at
herself
a
little
stiffly
in
the
glass
put
a
dash
of
red
on
her
colourless
lips
and
rang
for
the
maid
coffee
giovanna
please
and
will
you
tell
strefford
that
i
should
like
to
see
him
if
nick
really
kept
to
his
intention
of
staying
away
for
a
few
days
she
must
trump
up
some
explanation
of
his
absence
but
her
mind
refused
to
work
and
the
only
thing
she
could
think
of
was
to
take
strefford
into
her
confidence
she
knew
that
he
could
be
trusted
in
a
real
difficulty
his
impish
malice
transformed
itself
into
a
resourceful
ingenuity
when
his
friends
required
it
the
maid
stood
looking
at
her
with
a
puzzled
gaze
and
susy
somewhat
sharply
repeated
her
order
but
don
t
wake
him
on
purpose
she
added
foreseeing
the
probable
effect
on
strefford
s
temper
but
signora
the
gentleman
is
already
already
out
strefford
who
could
hardly
be
routed
from
his
bed
before
is
it
so
late
susy
cried
incredulous
after
nine
and
the
gentleman
took
the
eight
o
clock
train
for
england
gervaso
said
he
had
received
a
telegram
he
left
word
that
he
would
write
to
the
the
door
closed
upon
the
maid
and
susy
continued
to
gaze
at
her
painted
image
in
the
glass
as
if
she
had
been
trying
to
outstare
an
importunate
stranger
there
was
no
one
left
for
her
to
take
counsel
of
then
no
one
but
poor
fred
gillow
she
made
a
grimace
at
the
idea
but
what
on
earth
could
have
summoned
strefford
back
to
england
xii
nick
lansing
in
the
milan
express
was
roused
by
the
same
bar
of
sunshine
lying
across
his
knees
he
yawned
looked
with
disgust
at
his
stolidly
sleeping
neighbours
and
wondered
why
he
had
decided
to
go
to
milan
and
what
on
earth
he
should
do
when
he
got
there
the
difficulty
about
trenchant
decisions
was
that
the
next
morning
they
generally
left
one
facing
a
void
when
the
train
drew
into
the
station
at
milan
he
scrambled
out
got
some
coffee
and
having
drunk
it
decided
to
continue
his
journey
to
genoa
the
state
of
being
carried
passively
onward
postponed
action
and
dulled
thought
and
after
twelve
hours
of
furious
mental
activity
that
was
exactly
what
he
wanted
he
fell
into
a
doze
again
waking
now
and
then
to
haggard
intervals
of
more
thinking
and
then
dropping
off
to
the
clank
and
rattle
of
the
train
inside
his
head
in
his
waking
intervals
the
same
clanking
and
grinding
of
wheels
and
chains
went
on
unremittingly
he
had
done
all
his
lucid
thinking
within
an
hour
of
leaving
the
palazzo
vanderlyn
the
night
before
since
then
his
brain
had
simply
continued
to
revolve
indefatigably
about
the
same
old
problem
his
cup
of
coffee
instead
of
clearing
his
thoughts
had
merely
accelerated
their
pace
at
genoa
he
wandered
about
in
the
hot
streets
bought
a
cheap
and
some
underclothes
and
then
went
down
to
the
port
in
search
of
a
little
hotel
he
remembered
there
an
hour
later
he
was
sitting
in
the
smoking
and
glancing
vacantly
over
the
papers
while
he
waited
for
dinner
when
he
became
aware
of
being
timidly
but
intently
examined
by
a
small
gentleman
with
eyeglasses
who
sat
alone
at
the
adjoining
table
hullo
buttles
lansing
exclaimed
recognising
with
surprise
the
recalcitrant
secretary
who
had
resisted
miss
hicks
s
endeavour
to
convert
him
to
tiepolo
buttles
blushing
to
the
roots
of
his
scant
hair
half
rose
and
bowed
ceremoniously
nick
lansing
s
first
feeling
was
of
annoyance
at
being
disturbed
in
his
solitary
broodings
his
next
of
relief
at
having
to
postpone
them
even
to
converse
with
buttles
no
idea
you
were
here
is
the
yacht
in
harbour
he
asked
remembering
that
the
ibis
must
be
just
about
to
spread
her
wings
buttles
at
salute
behind
his
chair
signed
a
mute
negation
for
the
moment
he
seemed
too
embarrassed
to
speak
ah
you
re
here
as
an
advance
guard
i
remember
now
i
saw
miss
hicks
in
venice
the
day
before
yesterday
lansing
continued
dazed
at
the
thought
that
hardly
hours
had
passed
since
his
encounter
with
coral
in
the
scalzi
buttles
instead
of
speaking
had
tentatively
approached
his
table
may
i
take
this
seat
for
a
moment
lansing
thank
you
no
i
am
not
here
as
an
advance
guard
though
i
believe
the
ibis
is
due
some
time
he
cleared
his
throat
wiped
his
eyeglasses
on
a
silk
handkerchief
replaced
them
on
his
nose
and
went
on
solemnly
perhaps
to
clear
up
any
possible
misunderstanding
i
ought
to
say
that
i
am
no
longer
in
the
employ
of
lansing
glanced
at
him
sympathetically
it
was
clear
that
he
suffered
horribly
in
imparting
this
information
though
his
compact
face
did
not
lend
itself
to
any
dramatic
display
of
emotion
really
nick
smiled
and
then
ventured
i
hope
it
s
not
owing
to
conscientious
objections
to
tiepolo
buttles
s
blush
became
a
smouldering
agony
ah
miss
hicks
mentioned
to
you
told
you
no
lansing
i
am
principled
against
the
effete
art
of
tiepolo
and
of
all
his
contemporaries
i
confess
but
if
miss
hicks
chooses
to
surrender
herself
momentarily
to
the
unwholesome
spell
of
the
italian
decadence
it
is
not
for
me
to
protest
or
to
criticize
her
intellectual
and
aesthetic
range
so
far
exceeds
my
humble
capacity
that
it
would
be
ridiculous
unbecoming
he
broke
off
and
once
more
wiped
a
faint
moisture
from
his
eyeglasses
it
was
evident
that
he
was
suffering
from
a
distress
which
he
longed
and
yet
dreaded
to
communicate
but
nick
made
no
farther
effort
to
bridge
the
gulf
of
his
own
preoccupations
and
buttles
after
an
expectant
pause
went
on
if
you
see
me
here
it
is
only
because
after
a
somewhat
abrupt
departure
i
find
myself
unable
to
take
leave
of
our
friends
without
a
last
look
at
the
ibis
the
scene
of
so
many
stimulating
hours
but
i
must
beg
you
he
added
earnestly
should
you
see
miss
hicks
or
any
other
member
of
the
party
to
make
no
allusion
to
my
presence
in
genoa
i
wish
said
buttles
with
simplicity
to
preserve
the
strictest
lansing
glanced
at
him
kindly
oh
but
isn
t
that
a
little
unfriendly
no
other
course
is
possible
lansing
said
the
and
i
commit
myself
to
your
discretion
the
truth
is
if
i
am
here
it
is
not
to
look
once
more
at
the
ibis
but
at
miss
hicks
once
only
you
will
understand
me
and
appreciate
what
i
am
he
bowed
again
and
trotted
away
on
his
small
feet
pausing
on
the
threshold
to
say
from
the
first
it
was
hopeless
before
he
disappeared
through
the
glass
doors
a
gleam
of
commiseration
flashed
through
nick
s
mind
there
was
something
quaintly
poignant
in
the
sight
of
the
brisk
and
efficient
buttles
reduced
to
a
limp
image
of
unrequited
passion
and
what
a
painful
surprise
to
the
hickses
to
be
thus
suddenly
deprived
of
the
secretary
who
possessed
the
foreign
languages
beck
kept
the
accounts
and
settled
with
the
but
it
was
buttles
s
loftier
task
to
entertain
in
their
own
tongues
the
unknown
geniuses
who
flocked
about
the
hickses
and
nick
could
imagine
how
disconcerting
his
departure
must
be
on
the
eve
of
their
grecian
cruise
which
hicks
would
certainly
call
an
odyssey
the
next
moment
the
vision
of
coral
s
hopeless
suitor
had
faded
and
nick
was
once
more
spinning
around
on
the
wheel
of
his
own
woes
the
night
before
when
he
had
sent
his
note
to
susy
from
a
little
restaurant
close
to
palazzo
vanderlyn
that
they
often
patronized
he
had
done
so
with
the
firm
intention
of
going
away
for
a
day
or
two
in
order
to
collect
his
wits
and
think
over
the
situation
but
after
his
letter
had
been
entrusted
to
the
landlord
s
little
son
who
was
a
particular
friend
of
susy
s
nick
had
decided
to
await
the
lad
s
return
the
messenger
had
not
been
bidden
to
ask
for
an
answer
but
nick
knowing
the
friendly
and
inquisitive
italian
mind
was
almost
sure
that
the
boy
in
the
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
susy
would
linger
about
while
the
letter
was
carried
up
and
he
pictured
the
maid
knocking
at
his
wife
s
darkened
room
and
susy
dashing
some
powder
on
her
face
before
she
turned
on
the
light
poor
foolish
child
the
boy
had
returned
rather
sooner
than
nick
expected
and
he
had
brought
no
answer
but
merely
the
statement
that
the
signora
was
out
that
everybody
was
out
everybody
the
signora
and
the
four
gentlemen
who
were
dining
at
the
palace
they
all
went
out
together
on
foot
soon
after
dinner
there
was
no
one
to
whom
i
could
give
the
note
but
the
gondolier
on
the
landing
for
the
signora
had
said
she
would
be
very
late
and
had
sent
the
maid
to
bed
and
the
maid
had
of
course
gone
out
immediately
with
her
ah
said
nick
slipping
his
reward
into
the
boy
s
hand
and
walking
out
of
the
restaurant
susy
had
gone
out
gone
out
with
their
usual
band
as
she
did
every
night
in
these
sultry
summer
weeks
gone
out
after
her
talk
with
nick
as
if
nothing
had
happened
as
if
his
whole
world
and
hers
had
not
crashed
in
ruins
at
their
feet
ah
poor
susy
after
all
she
had
merely
obeyed
the
instinct
of
self
preservation
the
old
hard
habit
of
keeping
up
going
ahead
and
hiding
her
troubles
unless
indeed
the
habit
had
already
engendered
indifference
and
it
had
become
as
easy
for
her
as
for
most
of
her
friends
to
pass
from
drama
to
dancing
from
sorrow
to
the
cinema
what
of
soul
was
left
he
wondered
his
train
did
not
start
till
midnight
and
after
leaving
the
restaurant
nick
tramped
the
sultry
till
his
tired
legs
brought
him
to
a
standstill
under
the
pergola
of
a
gondolier
s
at
a
landing
close
to
the
piazzetta
there
he
could
absorb
cooling
drinks
until
it
was
time
to
go
to
the
station
it
was
after
eleven
and
he
was
beginning
to
look
about
for
a
boat
when
a
black
prow
pushed
up
to
the
steps
and
with
much
chaff
and
laughter
a
party
of
young
people
in
evening
dress
jumped
out
nick
from
under
the
darkness
of
the
vine
saw
that
there
was
only
one
lady
among
them
and
it
did
not
need
the
lamp
above
the
landing
to
reveal
her
identity
susy
bareheaded
and
laughing
a
light
scarf
slipping
from
her
bare
shoulders
a
cigarette
between
her
fingers
took
strefford
s
arm
and
turned
in
the
direction
of
florian
s
with
gillow
the
prince
and
young
breckenridge
in
her
wake
nick
had
relived
this
rapid
scene
hundreds
of
times
during
his
hours
in
the
train
and
his
aimless
trampings
through
the
streets
of
genoa
in
that
of
a
world
of
his
and
susy
s
you
had
to
keep
going
or
drop
out
and
susy
it
was
evident
had
chosen
to
keep
going
under
the
on
the
landing
he
had
had
a
good
look
at
her
face
and
had
seen
that
the
mask
of
paint
and
powder
was
carefully
enough
adjusted
to
hide
any
ravages
the
scene
between
them
might
have
left
he
even
fancied
that
she
had
dropped
a
little
atropine
into
her
eyes
there
was
no
time
to
spare
if
he
meant
to
catch
the
midnight
train
and
no
gondola
in
sight
but
that
which
his
wife
had
just
left
he
sprang
into
it
and
bade
the
gondolier
carry
him
to
the
station
the
cushions
as
he
leaned
back
gave
out
a
breath
of
her
scent
and
in
the
glare
of
electric
light
at
the
station
he
saw
at
his
feet
a
rose
which
had
fallen
from
her
dress
he
ground
his
heel
into
it
as
he
got
out
there
it
was
then
that
was
the
last
picture
he
was
to
have
of
her
for
he
knew
now
that
he
was
not
going
back
at
least
not
to
take
up
their
life
together
he
supposed
he
should
have
to
see
her
once
to
talk
things
over
settle
something
for
their
future
he
had
been
sincere
in
saying
that
he
bore
her
no
only
he
could
never
go
back
into
that
slough
again
if
he
did
he
knew
he
would
inevitably
be
drawn
under
slipping
downward
from
concession
to
concession
the
noises
of
a
hot
summer
night
in
the
port
of
genoa
would
have
kept
the
most
from
slumber
but
though
nick
lay
awake
he
did
not
notice
them
for
the
tumult
in
his
brain
was
more
deafening
dawn
brought
a
negative
relief
and
out
of
sheer
weariness
he
dropped
into
a
heavy
sleep
when
he
woke
it
was
nearly
noon
and
from
his
window
he
saw
the
outline
of
the
ibis
standing
up
dark
against
the
glitter
of
the
harbour
he
had
no
fear
of
meeting
her
owners
who
had
doubtless
long
since
landed
and
betaken
themselves
to
cooler
and
more
fashionable
regions
oddly
enough
the
fact
seemed
to
accentuate
his
loneliness
his
sense
of
having
no
one
on
earth
to
turn
to
he
dressed
and
wandered
out
disconsolately
to
pick
up
a
cup
of
coffee
in
some
shady
corner
as
he
drank
his
coffee
his
thoughts
gradually
cleared
it
became
obvious
to
him
that
he
had
behaved
like
a
madman
or
a
petulant
child
he
preferred
to
think
it
was
like
a
madman
if
he
and
susy
were
to
separate
there
was
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
done
decently
and
quietly
as
such
transactions
were
habitually
managed
among
people
of
their
kind
it
seemed
grotesque
to
introduce
melodrama
into
their
little
world
of
unruffled
sybarites
and
he
felt
inclined
now
to
smile
at
the
incongruity
of
his
gesture
but
suddenly
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
the
future
without
susy
was
unbearable
inconceivable
why
after
all
should
they
separate
at
the
question
her
soft
face
seemed
close
to
his
and
that
slight
lift
of
the
upper
lip
that
made
her
smile
so
exquisite
well
he
would
go
back
but
not
with
any
presence
of
going
to
talk
things
over
come
to
an
agreement
wind
up
their
joint
life
like
a
business
association
no
if
he
went
back
he
would
go
without
conditions
for
good
forever
only
what
about
the
future
what
about
the
not
day
when
the
wedding
cheques
would
have
been
spent
and
granny
s
pearls
sold
and
nothing
left
except
unconcealed
and
unconditional
dependence
on
rich
friends
the
role
of
the
acknowledged
was
there
no
other
possible
solution
no
new
way
of
ordering
their
lives
no
there
was
none
he
could
not
picture
susy
out
of
her
setting
of
luxury
and
leisure
could
not
picture
either
of
them
living
such
a
life
as
the
nat
fulmers
for
instance
he
remembered
the
shabby
untidy
bungalow
in
new
hampshire
the
slatternly
servants
uneatable
food
and
ubiquitous
children
how
could
he
ask
susy
to
share
such
a
life
with
him
if
he
did
she
would
probably
have
the
sense
to
refuse
their
alliance
had
been
based
on
a
moment
s
midsummer
madness
now
the
score
must
be
paid
he
decided
to
write
if
they
were
to
part
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
see
her
he
called
a
waiter
asked
for
pen
and
paper
and
pushed
aside
a
pile
of
unread
newspapers
on
the
corner
of
the
table
where
his
coffee
had
been
served
as
he
did
so
his
eye
lit
on
a
daily
mail
of
two
days
before
as
a
pretext
for
postponing
his
letter
he
took
up
the
paper
and
glanced
down
the
first
page
he
read
tragic
yachting
accident
in
the
solent
the
earl
of
altringham
and
his
son
viscount
d
amblay
drowned
in
midnight
collision
both
bodies
he
read
on
he
grasped
the
fact
that
the
disaster
had
happened
the
night
before
he
had
left
venice
and
that
as
the
result
of
a
fog
in
the
solent
their
old
friend
strefford
was
now
earl
of
altringham
and
possessor
of
one
of
the
largest
private
fortunes
in
england
it
was
vertiginous
to
think
of
their
old
impecunious
streff
as
the
hero
of
such
an
adventure
and
what
irony
in
that
double
turn
of
the
wheel
which
in
one
day
had
plunged
him
nick
lansing
into
nethermost
misery
while
it
tossed
the
other
to
the
stars
with
an
intenser
precision
he
saw
again
susy
s
descent
from
the
gondola
at
the
calle
steps
the
sound
of
her
laughter
and
of
strefford
s
chaff
the
way
she
had
caught
his
arm
and
clung
to
it
sweeping
the
other
men
on
in
her
train
strefford
susy
and
strefford
more
than
once
nick
had
noticed
the
softer
inflections
of
his
friend
s
voice
when
he
spoke
to
susy
the
brooding
look
in
his
lazy
eyes
when
they
rested
on
her
in
the
security
of
his
wedded
bliss
nick
had
made
light
of
those
signs
the
only
real
jealousy
he
had
felt
had
been
of
fred
gillow
because
of
his
unlimited
power
to
satisfy
a
woman
s
whims
yet
nick
knew
that
such
material
advantages
would
never
again
suffice
for
susy
with
strefford
it
was
different
she
had
delighted
in
his
society
while
he
was
notoriously
ineligible
might
not
she
find
him
irresistible
now
the
forgotten
terms
of
their
bridal
compact
came
back
to
nick
the
absurd
agreement
on
which
he
and
susy
had
solemnly
pledged
their
faith
but
was
it
so
absurd
after
all
it
had
been
susy
s
suggestion
not
his
thank
god
and
perhaps
in
making
it
she
had
been
more
serious
than
he
imagined
perhaps
even
if
their
rupture
had
not
occurred
strefford
s
sudden
honours
might
have
caused
her
to
ask
for
her
freedom
money
luxury
fashion
pleasure
those
were
the
four
cornerstones
of
her
existence
he
had
always
known
it
she
herself
had
always
acknowledged
it
even
in
their
last
dreadful
talk
together
and
once
he
had
gloried
in
her
frankness
how
could
he
ever
have
imagined
that
to
have
her
fill
of
these
things
she
would
not
in
time
stoop
lower
than
she
had
yet
stooped
perhaps
in
giving
her
up
to
strefford
he
might
be
saving
her
at
any
rate
the
taste
of
the
past
was
now
so
bitter
to
him
that
he
was
moved
to
thank
whatever
gods
there
were
for
pushing
that
mortuary
paragraph
under
his
eye
susy
dear
he
wrote
the
fates
seem
to
have
taken
our
future
in
hand
and
spared
us
the
trouble
of
unravelling
it
if
i
have
sometimes
been
selfish
enough
to
forget
the
conditions
on
which
you
agreed
to
marry
me
they
have
come
back
to
me
during
these
two
days
of
solitude
you
ve
given
me
the
best
a
man
can
have
and
nothing
else
will
ever
be
worth
much
to
me
but
since
i
haven
t
the
ability
to
provide
you
with
what
you
want
i
recognize
that
i
ve
no
right
to
stand
in
your
way
we
must
owe
no
more
venetian
palaces
to
underhand
services
i
see
by
the
newspapers
that
streff
can
now
give
you
as
many
palaces
as
you
want
let
him
have
the
chance
i
fancy
he
ll
jump
at
it
and
he
s
the
best
man
in
sight
i
wish
i
were
in
his
shoes
i
ll
write
again
in
a
day
or
two
when
i
ve
collected
my
wits
and
can
give
you
an
address
he
added
a
line
on
the
subject
of
their
modest
funds
put
the
letter
into
an
envelope
and
addressed
it
to
nicholas
lansing
as
he
did
so
he
reflected
that
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
written
his
wife
s
married
name
well
by
god
no
other
woman
shall
have
it
after
her
he
vowed
as
he
groped
in
his
pocketbook
for
a
stamp
he
stood
up
with
a
stretch
of
weariness
the
heat
was
stifling
and
put
the
letter
in
his
pocket
i
ll
post
it
myself
it
s
safer
he
thought
and
then
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
shall
i
do
next
i
wonder
he
jammed
his
hat
down
on
his
head
and
walked
out
into
the
as
he
was
turning
away
from
the
square
by
the
general
post
office
a
white
parasol
waved
from
a
passing
cab
and
coral
hicks
leaned
forward
with
outstretched
hand
i
knew
i
d
find
you
she
triumphed
i
ve
been
driving
up
and
down
in
this
broiling
sun
for
hours
shopping
and
watching
for
you
at
the
same
he
stared
at
her
blankly
too
bewildered
even
to
wonder
how
she
knew
he
was
in
genoa
and
she
continued
with
the
kind
of
shy
imperiousness
that
always
made
him
feel
in
her
presence
like
a
member
of
an
orchestra
under
a
masterful
baton
now
please
get
right
into
this
carriage
and
don
t
keep
me
roasting
here
another
to
the
cabdriver
she
called
out
al
nick
lansing
sank
down
beside
her
as
he
did
so
he
noticed
a
heap
of
bundles
at
her
feet
and
felt
that
he
had
simply
added
one
more
to
the
number
he
supposed
that
she
was
taking
her
spoils
to
the
ibis
and
that
he
would
be
carried
up
to
the
to
be
displayed
with
the
others
well
it
would
all
help
to
pass
the
day
and
by
night
he
would
have
reached
some
kind
of
a
decision
about
his
future
on
the
third
day
after
nick
s
departure
the
post
brought
to
the
palazzo
vanderlyn
three
letters
for
lansing
the
first
to
arrive
was
a
word
from
strefford
scribbled
in
the
train
and
posted
at
turin
in
it
he
briefly
said
that
he
had
been
called
home
by
the
dreadful
accident
of
which
susy
had
probably
read
in
the
daily
papers
he
added
that
he
would
write
again
from
england
and
then
in
a
blotted
postscript
i
wanted
uncommonly
badly
to
see
you
for
but
the
hour
was
impossible
regards
to
nick
do
write
me
just
a
word
to
the
other
two
letters
which
came
together
in
the
afternoon
were
both
from
genoa
susy
scanned
the
addresses
and
fell
upon
the
one
in
her
husband
s
writing
her
hand
trembled
so
much
that
for
a
moment
she
could
not
open
the
envelope
when
she
had
done
so
she
devoured
the
letter
in
a
flash
and
then
sat
and
brooded
over
the
outspread
page
as
it
lay
on
her
knee
it
might
mean
so
many
things
she
could
read
into
it
so
many
harrowing
alternatives
of
indifference
and
despair
of
irony
and
tenderness
was
he
suffering
tortures
when
he
wrote
it
or
seeking
only
to
inflict
them
upon
her
or
did
the
words
represent
his
actual
feelings
no
more
and
no
less
and
did
he
really
intend
her
to
understand
that
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
abide
by
the
letter
of
their
preposterous
compact
he
had
left
her
in
wrath
and
indignation
yet
as
a
closer
scrutiny
revealed
there
was
not
a
word
of
reproach
in
his
brief
lines
perhaps
that
was
why
in
the
last
issue
they
seemed
so
cold
to
her
she
shivered
and
turned
to
the
other
envelope
the
large
stilted
characters
though
called
up
no
definite
image
she
opened
the
envelope
and
discovered
a
of
the
ibis
canvas
spread
bounding
over
a
rippled
sea
on
the
back
was
written
so
awfully
dear
of
you
to
lend
us
lansing
for
a
little
cruise
you
may
count
on
our
taking
the
best
of
care
of
him
coral
part
ii
xiii
when
violet
melrose
had
said
to
susy
branch
the
winter
before
in
new
york
but
why
on
earth
don
t
you
and
nick
go
to
my
little
place
at
versailles
for
the
honeymoon
i
m
off
to
china
and
you
could
have
it
to
yourselves
all
summer
the
offer
had
been
tempting
enough
to
make
the
lovers
waver
it
was
such
an
artless
ingenuous
little
house
so
full
of
the
demoralizing
simplicity
of
great
wealth
that
it
seemed
to
susy
just
the
kind
of
place
in
which
to
take
the
first
steps
in
renunciation
but
nick
had
objected
that
paris
at
that
time
of
year
would
be
swarming
with
acquaintances
who
would
hunt
them
down
at
all
hours
and
susy
s
own
experience
had
led
her
to
remark
that
there
was
nothing
the
very
rich
enjoyed
more
than
taking
with
the
very
poor
they
therefore
gave
strefford
s
villa
the
preference
with
an
inward
proviso
on
susy
s
part
that
violet
s
house
might
very
conveniently
serve
their
purpose
at
another
season
these
thoughts
were
in
her
mind
as
she
drove
up
to
melrose
s
door
on
a
rainy
afternoon
late
in
august
her
boxes
piled
high
on
the
roof
of
the
cab
she
had
taken
at
the
station
she
had
travelled
straight
through
from
venice
stopping
in
milan
just
long
enough
to
pick
up
a
reply
to
the
telegram
she
had
despatched
to
the
perfect
housekeeper
whose
permanent
presence
enabled
melrose
to
say
oh
when
i
m
sick
of
everything
i
just
rush
off
without
warning
to
my
little
shanty
at
versailles
and
live
there
all
alone
on
scrambled
the
perfect
had
replied
to
susy
s
enquiry
am
sure
melrose
most
happy
and
susy
without
further
thought
had
jumped
into
a
versailles
train
and
now
stood
in
the
thin
rain
before
the
threshold
of
the
pavilion
the
revolving
year
had
brought
around
the
season
at
which
melrose
s
house
might
be
convenient
no
visitors
were
to
be
feared
at
versailles
at
the
end
of
august
and
though
susy
s
reasons
for
seeking
solitude
were
so
remote
from
those
she
had
once
prefigured
they
were
none
the
less
cogent
to
be
alone
alone
after
those
first
exposed
days
when
in
the
persistent
presence
of
fred
gillow
and
his
satellites
and
in
the
mocking
radiance
of
late
summer
on
the
lagoons
she
had
fumed
and
turned
about
in
her
agony
like
a
trapped
animal
in
a
cramping
cage
to
be
alone
had
seemed
the
only
respite
the
one
craving
to
be
alone
somewhere
in
a
setting
as
unlike
as
possible
to
the
sensual
splendours
of
venice
under
skies
as
unlike
its
azure
roof
if
she
could
have
chosen
she
would
have
crawled
away
into
a
dingy
inn
in
a
rainy
northern
town
where
she
had
never
been
and
no
one
knew
her
failing
that
unobtainable
luxury
here
she
was
on
the
threshold
of
an
empty
house
in
a
deserted
place
under
lowering
skies
she
had
shaken
off
fred
gillow
sulkily
departing
for
his
moor
where
she
had
to
join
him
in
september
the
prince
young
breckenridge
and
the
few
remaining
survivors
of
the
venetian
group
had
dispersed
in
the
direction
of
the
engadine
or
biarritz
and
now
she
could
at
least
collect
her
wits
take
stock
of
herself
and
prepare
the
countenance
with
which
she
was
to
face
the
next
stage
in
her
career
thank
god
it
was
raining
at
versailles
the
door
opened
she
heard
voices
in
the
and
a
slender
languishing
figure
appeared
on
the
threshold
darling
violet
melrose
cried
in
an
embrace
drawing
her
into
the
dusky
perfumed
room
but
i
thought
you
were
in
china
susy
stammered
in
china
in
china
melrose
stared
with
dreamy
eyes
and
susy
remembered
her
drifting
disorganised
life
a
life
more
planless
more
inexplicable
than
that
of
any
of
the
other
ephemeral
beings
blown
about
upon
the
same
winds
of
pleasure
well
madam
i
thought
so
myself
till
i
got
a
wire
from
melrose
last
evening
remarked
the
perfect
following
with
susy
s
handbag
melrose
clutched
her
cavernous
temples
in
her
attenuated
hands
of
course
of
course
i
had
meant
to
go
to
china
no
india
but
i
ve
discovered
a
genius
and
genius
you
know
unable
to
complete
her
thought
she
sank
down
upon
a
pillowy
divan
stretched
out
an
arm
cried
fulmer
fulmer
and
while
susy
lansing
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
widening
eyes
a
man
emerged
from
the
more
deeply
cushioned
and
scented
twilight
of
some
inner
apartment
and
she
saw
with
surprise
nat
fulmer
the
good
nat
fulmer
of
the
new
hampshire
bungalow
and
the
ubiquitous
progeny
standing
before
her
in
lordly
ease
his
hands
in
his
pockets
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
his
feet
solidly
planted
in
the
insidious
depths
of
one
of
violet
melrose
s
white
leopard
skins
susy
he
shouted
with
open
arms
and
melrose
murmured
you
didn
t
know
then
you
hadn
t
heard
of
his
masterpieces
in
spite
of
herself
susy
burst
into
a
laugh
is
nat
your
genius
melrose
looked
at
her
reproachfully
fulmer
laughed
no
i
m
grace
s
but
melrose
has
been
our
providence
and
providence
his
hostess
interrupted
don
t
talk
as
if
you
were
at
a
he
had
an
exhibition
in
new
york
it
was
the
most
fabulous
success
he
s
come
abroad
to
make
studies
for
the
decoration
of
my
in
new
york
ursula
gillow
has
given
him
her
at
roslyn
to
do
and
bockheimer
s
oh
fulmer
where
are
the
cartoons
she
sprang
up
tossed
about
some
heaped
on
a
lacquer
table
and
sank
back
exhausted
by
the
effort
i
d
got
as
far
as
brindisi
i
ve
travelled
day
and
night
to
be
here
to
meet
him
she
declared
but
you
darling
and
she
held
out
a
caressing
hand
to
susy
i
m
forgetting
to
ask
if
you
ve
had
tea
an
hour
later
over
the
susy
already
felt
herself
mysteriously
reabsorbed
into
what
had
so
long
been
her
native
element
ellie
vanderlyn
had
brought
a
breath
of
it
to
venice
but
susy
was
then
nourished
on
another
air
the
air
of
nick
s
presence
and
personality
now
that
she
was
abandoned
left
again
to
her
own
devices
she
felt
herself
suddenly
at
the
mercy
of
the
influences
from
which
she
thought
she
had
escaped
in
the
queer
social
whirligig
from
which
she
had
so
lately
fled
it
seemed
natural
enough
that
a
shake
of
the
box
should
have
tossed
nat
fulmer
into
celebrity
and
sent
violet
melrose
chasing
back
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
bask
in
his
success
susy
knew
that
melrose
belonged
to
the
class
of
moral
parasites
for
in
that
strange
world
the
parts
were
sometimes
reversed
and
the
wealthy
preyed
upon
the
pauper
wherever
there
was
a
reputation
to
batten
on
there
poor
violet
appeared
a
harmless
vampire
in
pearls
who
sought
only
to
feed
on
the
notoriety
which
all
her
millions
could
not
create
for
her
any
one
less
versed
than
susy
in
the
shallow
mysteries
of
her
little
world
would
have
seen
in
violet
melrose
a
baleful
enchantress
in
nat
fulmer
her
helpless
victim
susy
knew
better
violet
poor
violet
was
not
even
that
the
insignificant
ellie
vanderlyn
with
her
brief
trivial
passions
her
artless
mixture
of
amorous
and
social
interests
was
a
woman
with
a
purpose
a
creature
who
fulfilled
herself
but
violet
was
only
a
drifting
interrogation
and
what
of
fulmer
mustering
with
new
eyes
his
short
figure
his
nondescript
bearded
face
and
the
eyes
that
dreamed
and
wandered
and
then
suddenly
sank
into
you
like
claws
susy
seemed
to
have
found
the
key
to
all
his
years
of
dogged
toil
his
indifference
to
neglect
indifference
to
poverty
indifference
to
the
needs
of
his
growing
family
yes
for
the
first
time
she
saw
that
he
looked
commonplace
enough
to
be
a
genius
was
a
genius
perhaps
even
though
it
was
violet
melrose
who
affirmed
it
susy
looked
steadily
at
fulmer
their
eyes
met
and
he
smiled
at
her
faintly
through
his
beard
yes
i
did
discover
him
i
did
melrose
was
insisting
from
the
depths
of
the
black
velvet
divan
in
which
she
lay
sunk
like
a
wan
nereid
in
a
midnight
sea
you
mustn
t
believe
a
word
that
ursula
gillow
tells
you
about
having
pounced
on
his
spring
snow
storm
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
american
artists
exhibition
skied
if
you
please
they
skied
him
less
than
a
year
ago
and
naturally
ursula
never
in
her
life
looked
higher
than
the
first
line
at
a
and
now
she
actually
pretends
oh
for
pity
s
sake
don
t
say
it
doesn
t
matter
fulmer
your
saying
that
just
encourages
her
and
makes
people
think
she
did
when
in
reality
any
one
who
saw
me
at
the
exhibition
on
who
well
eddy
breckenridge
for
instance
he
was
in
egypt
you
say
perhaps
he
was
as
if
one
could
remember
the
people
about
one
when
suddenly
one
comes
upon
a
great
work
of
art
as
paul
did
didn
t
he
and
the
scales
fell
from
his
eyes
well
that
s
exactly
what
happened
to
me
that
day
and
ursula
everybody
knows
was
down
at
roslyn
at
the
time
and
didn
t
come
up
for
the
opening
of
the
exhibition
at
all
and
fulmer
sits
there
and
laughs
and
says
it
doesn
t
matter
and
that
he
ll
paint
another
picture
any
day
for
me
to
discover
susy
had
rung
the
with
a
hand
trembling
with
eagerness
eagerness
to
be
alone
to
be
quiet
to
stare
her
situation
in
the
face
and
collect
herself
before
she
came
out
again
among
her
kind
she
had
stood
on
the
cowering
among
her
bags
counting
the
instants
till
a
step
sounded
and
the
turned
letting
her
in
from
the
searching
glare
of
the
outer
world
and
now
she
had
sat
for
an
hour
in
violet
s
in
the
very
house
where
her
might
have
been
spent
and
no
one
had
asked
her
where
she
had
come
from
or
why
she
was
alone
or
what
was
the
key
to
the
tragedy
written
on
her
shrinking
face
that
was
the
way
of
the
world
they
lived
in
nobody
questioned
nobody
wondered
any
more
because
nobody
had
time
to
remember
the
old
risk
of
prying
curiosity
of
malicious
gossip
was
virtually
over
one
was
left
with
one
s
drama
one
s
disaster
on
one
s
hands
because
there
was
nobody
to
stop
and
notice
the
little
shrouded
object
one
was
carrying
as
susy
watched
the
two
people
before
her
each
so
frankly
unaffected
by
her
presence
violet
melrose
so
engrossed
in
her
feverish
pursuit
of
notoriety
fulmer
so
plunged
in
the
golden
sea
of
his
success
she
felt
like
a
ghost
making
inaudible
and
imperceptible
appeals
to
the
grosser
senses
of
the
living
if
i
wanted
to
be
alone
she
thought
i
m
alone
enough
in
all
there
was
a
deathly
chill
in
such
security
she
turned
to
fulmer
and
grace
he
beamed
back
without
sign
of
embarrassment
oh
she
s
here
naturally
we
re
in
paris
kids
and
all
in
a
pension
where
we
can
polish
up
the
lingo
but
i
hardly
ever
lay
eyes
on
her
because
she
s
as
deep
in
music
as
i
am
in
paint
it
was
as
big
a
chance
for
her
as
for
me
you
see
and
she
s
making
the
most
of
it
fiddling
and
listening
to
the
fiddlers
well
it
s
a
considerable
change
from
new
he
looked
at
her
dreamily
as
if
making
an
intense
effort
to
detach
himself
from
his
dream
and
situate
her
in
the
fading
past
remember
the
bungalow
and
nick
ah
how
s
nick
he
brought
out
triumphantly
oh
yes
darling
nick
melrose
chimed
in
and
susy
her
head
erect
her
cheeks
aflame
declared
with
resonance
most
awfully
well
splendidly
he
s
not
here
though
from
fulmer
no
he
s
off
travelling
melrose
s
attention
was
faintly
roused
with
anybody
interesting
no
you
wouldn
t
know
them
people
we
met
she
did
not
have
to
continue
for
her
hostess
s
gaze
had
again
strayed
and
you
ve
come
for
your
clothes
i
suppose
darling
don
t
listen
to
people
who
say
that
skirts
are
to
be
wider
i
ve
discovered
a
new
woman
a
genius
and
she
absolutely
swathes
you
her
name
s
my
secret
but
we
ll
go
to
her
susy
rose
from
her
engulphing
armchair
do
you
mind
if
i
go
up
to
my
room
i
m
rather
tired
coming
straight
of
course
dear
i
think
there
are
some
people
coming
to
dinner
mrs
match
will
tell
you
she
has
such
a
memory
fulmer
where
on
earth
are
those
cartoons
of
the
their
voices
pursued
susy
upstairs
as
in
match
s
perpendicular
wake
she
mounted
to
the
room
with
its
gay
linen
hangings
and
the
low
bed
heaped
with
more
cushions
if
we
d
come
here
she
thought
everything
might
have
been
and
she
shuddered
at
the
sumptuous
memories
of
the
palazzo
vanderlyn
and
the
great
painted
bedroom
where
she
had
met
her
doom
mrs
match
hoping
she
would
find
everything
and
mentioning
that
dinner
was
not
till
nine
shut
her
softly
in
among
her
terrors
find
everything
susy
echoed
the
phrase
oh
yes
she
would
always
find
everything
every
time
the
door
shut
on
her
now
and
the
sound
of
voices
ceased
her
memories
would
be
there
waiting
for
her
every
one
of
them
waiting
quietly
patiently
obstinately
like
poor
people
in
a
doctor
s
office
the
people
who
are
always
last
to
be
attended
to
but
whom
nothing
will
discourage
or
drive
away
people
to
whom
time
is
nothing
fatigue
nothing
hunger
nothing
other
engagements
nothing
who
just
wait
thank
heaven
after
all
that
she
had
not
found
the
house
empty
if
whenever
she
returned
to
her
room
she
was
to
meet
her
memories
there
it
was
just
a
week
since
nick
had
left
her
during
that
week
crammed
with
people
questions
packing
explaining
evading
she
had
believed
that
in
solitude
lay
her
salvation
now
she
understood
that
there
was
nothing
she
was
so
unprepared
for
so
unfitted
for
when
in
all
her
life
had
she
ever
been
alone
and
how
was
she
to
bear
it
now
with
all
these
ravening
memories
besetting
her
dinner
not
till
nine
what
on
earth
was
she
to
do
till
nine
o
clock
she
knelt
before
her
boxes
and
feverishly
began
to
unpack
gradually
imperceptibly
the
subtle
influences
of
her
old
life
were
stealing
into
her
as
she
pulled
out
her
tossed
and
crumpled
dresses
she
remembered
violet
s
emphatic
warning
don
t
believe
the
people
who
tell
you
that
skirts
are
going
to
be
were
hers
perhaps
too
wide
as
it
was
she
looked
at
her
limp
raiment
piling
itself
up
on
bed
and
sofa
and
understood
that
according
to
violet
s
standards
and
that
of
all
her
set
those
dresses
which
nick
had
thought
so
original
and
exquisite
were
already
commonplace
and
dowdy
fit
only
to
be
passed
on
to
poor
relations
or
given
to
one
s
maid
and
susy
would
have
to
go
on
wearing
them
till
they
fell
to
bits
or
else
well
or
else
begin
the
old
life
again
in
some
new
form
she
laughed
aloud
at
the
turn
of
her
thoughts
dresses
how
little
they
had
mattered
a
few
short
weeks
ago
and
now
perhaps
they
would
again
be
one
of
the
foremost
considerations
in
her
life
how
could
it
be
otherwise
if
she
were
to
return
again
to
her
old
dependence
on
ellie
vanderlyn
ursula
gillow
violet
melrose
and
beyond
that
only
the
bockheimers
and
their
kind
awaited
her
a
knock
on
the
door
what
a
relief
it
was
mrs
match
again
with
a
telegram
to
whom
had
susy
given
her
new
address
with
a
throbbing
heart
she
tore
open
the
envelope
and
read
shall
be
in
paris
friday
for
hours
where
can
i
see
you
write
nouveau
ah
yes
she
remembered
now
she
had
written
to
strefford
and
this
was
his
answer
he
was
coming
she
dropped
into
a
chair
and
tried
to
think
what
on
earth
had
she
said
in
her
letter
it
had
been
mainly
of
course
one
of
condolence
but
now
she
remembered
having
added
in
a
precipitate
postscript
i
can
t
give
your
message
to
nick
for
he
s
gone
off
with
the
hickses
i
don
t
know
where
or
for
how
long
it
s
all
right
of
course
it
was
in
our
she
had
not
meant
to
put
in
that
last
phrase
but
as
she
sealed
her
letter
to
strefford
her
eye
had
fallen
on
nick
s
missive
which
lay
beside
it
nothing
in
her
husband
s
brief
lines
had
embittered
her
as
much
as
the
allusion
to
strefford
it
seemed
to
imply
that
nick
s
own
plans
were
made
that
his
own
future
was
secure
and
that
he
could
therefore
freely
and
handsomely
take
thought
for
hers
and
give
her
a
pointer
in
the
right
direction
sudden
rage
had
possessed
her
at
the
thought
where
she
had
at
first
read
jealousy
she
now
saw
only
a
cold
providence
and
in
a
blur
of
tears
she
had
scrawled
her
postscript
to
strefford
she
remembered
that
she
had
not
even
asked
him
to
keep
her
secret
well
after
all
what
would
it
matter
if
people
should
already
know
that
nick
had
left
her
their
parting
could
not
long
remain
a
mystery
and
the
fact
that
it
was
known
might
help
her
to
keep
up
a
presence
of
indifference
it
was
in
the
bargain
in
the
bargain
rang
through
her
brain
as
she
strefford
s
telegram
she
understood
that
he
had
snatched
the
time
for
this
hasty
trip
solely
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
and
her
eyes
filled
the
more
bitterly
she
thought
of
nick
the
more
this
proof
of
strefford
s
friendship
moved
her
the
clock
to
her
relief
reminded
her
that
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
she
would
go
down
presently
chat
with
violet
and
fulmer
and
with
violet
s
other
guests
who
would
probably
be
odd
and
amusing
and
too
much
out
of
her
world
to
embarrass
her
by
awkward
questions
she
would
sit
at
a
table
breathe
delicate
scents
eat
exquisite
food
trust
mrs
match
and
be
gradually
drawn
again
under
the
spell
of
her
old
associations
anything
anything
but
to
be
alone
she
dressed
with
even
more
than
her
habitual
care
reddened
her
lips
attentively
brushed
the
faintest
bloom
of
pink
over
her
drawn
cheeks
and
went
down
to
meet
mrs
match
coming
up
with
a
tray
oh
madam
i
thought
you
were
too
tired
i
was
bringing
it
up
to
you
myself
just
a
little
morsel
of
susy
glancing
past
her
saw
through
the
open
door
that
the
lamps
were
not
lit
in
the
oh
no
i
m
not
tired
thank
you
i
thought
melrose
expected
friends
at
dinner
friends
at
mrs
match
heaved
a
despairing
sigh
sometimes
the
sigh
seemed
to
say
her
mistress
put
too
great
a
strain
upon
her
why
melrose
and
fulmer
were
engaged
to
dine
in
paris
they
left
an
hour
ago
melrose
told
me
she
d
told
you
the
wailed
susy
kept
her
little
fixed
smile
i
must
have
misunderstood
in
that
case
well
yes
if
it
s
no
trouble
i
believe
i
will
have
my
tray
slowly
she
turned
and
followed
the
housekeeper
up
into
the
dread
solitude
she
had
just
left
xiv
the
next
day
a
lot
of
people
turned
up
unannounced
for
luncheon
they
were
not
of
the
and
the
exotic
in
whom
melrose
now
specialized
but
merely
commonplace
fashionable
people
belonging
to
susy
s
own
group
people
familiar
with
the
amusing
romance
of
her
penniless
marriage
and
to
whom
she
had
to
explain
though
none
of
them
really
listened
to
the
explanation
that
nick
was
not
with
her
just
now
but
had
gone
off
cruising
cruising
in
the
aegean
with
friends
getting
up
material
for
his
book
this
detail
had
occurred
to
her
in
the
night
it
was
the
kind
of
encounter
she
had
most
dreaded
but
it
proved
after
all
easy
enough
to
go
through
compared
with
those
endless
hours
of
turning
to
and
fro
the
night
before
in
the
cage
of
her
lonely
room
anything
anything
but
to
be
alone
gradually
from
the
force
of
habit
she
found
herself
actually
in
tune
with
the
talk
of
the
luncheon
table
interested
in
the
references
to
absent
friends
the
light
allusions
to
last
year
s
loves
and
quarrels
scandals
and
absurdities
the
women
in
their
pale
summer
dresses
were
so
graceful
indolent
and
sure
of
themselves
the
men
so
easy
and
perhaps
after
all
susy
reflected
it
was
the
world
she
was
meant
for
since
the
other
the
brief
paradise
of
her
dreams
had
already
shut
its
golden
doors
upon
her
and
then
as
they
sat
on
the
terrace
after
luncheon
looking
across
at
the
yellow
of
the
park
one
of
the
women
said
something
made
just
an
allusion
that
susy
would
have
let
pass
unnoticed
in
the
old
days
but
that
now
filled
her
with
a
sudden
deep
disgust
she
stood
up
and
wandered
away
away
from
them
all
through
the
fading
garden
two
days
later
susy
and
strefford
sat
on
the
terrace
of
the
tuileries
above
the
seine
she
had
asked
him
to
meet
her
there
with
the
desire
to
avoid
the
crowded
halls
and
of
the
nouveau
luxe
where
even
at
that
supposedly
dead
season
people
one
knew
were
always
drifting
to
and
fro
and
they
sat
on
a
bench
in
the
pale
sunlight
the
discoloured
leaves
heaped
at
their
feet
and
no
one
to
share
their
solitude
but
a
lame
and
a
haggard
woman
who
were
lunching
together
mournfully
at
the
other
end
of
the
majestic
vista
strefford
in
his
new
mourning
looked
unnaturally
prosperous
and
but
his
ugly
untidy
features
remained
as
undisciplined
his
smile
as
whimsical
as
of
old
he
had
been
on
cool
though
friendly
terms
with
the
pompous
uncle
and
the
poor
sickly
cousin
whose
joint
disappearance
had
so
abruptly
transformed
his
future
and
it
was
his
way
to
understate
his
feelings
rather
than
to
pretend
more
than
he
felt
nevertheless
beneath
his
habitual
bantering
tone
susy
discerned
a
change
the
disaster
had
shocked
him
profoundly
already
in
his
brief
sojourn
among
his
people
and
among
the
great
possessions
so
tragically
acquired
old
instincts
had
awakened
forgotten
associations
had
spoken
in
him
susy
listened
to
him
wistfully
silenced
by
her
imaginative
perception
of
the
distance
that
these
things
had
put
between
them
it
was
horrible
seeing
them
both
there
together
laid
out
in
that
hideous
pugin
chapel
at
altringham
the
poor
boy
especially
i
suppose
that
s
really
what
s
cutting
me
up
now
he
murmured
almost
apologetically
oh
it
s
more
than
that
more
than
you
know
she
insisted
but
he
jerked
back
now
my
dear
don
t
be
edifying
please
and
fumbled
for
a
cigarette
in
the
pocket
which
was
already
beginning
to
bulge
with
his
miscellaneous
properties
and
now
about
you
for
that
s
what
i
came
for
he
continued
turning
to
her
with
one
of
his
sudden
movements
i
couldn
t
make
head
or
tail
of
your
she
paused
a
moment
to
steady
her
voice
couldn
t
you
i
suppose
you
d
forgotten
my
bargain
with
nick
he
hadn
t
and
he
s
asked
me
to
fulfil
strefford
stared
what
that
nonsense
about
your
setting
each
other
free
if
either
of
you
had
the
chance
to
make
a
good
match
she
signed
and
he
s
actually
asked
you
well
practically
he
s
gone
off
with
the
hickses
before
going
he
wrote
me
that
we
d
better
both
consider
ourselves
free
and
coral
sent
me
a
postcard
to
say
that
she
would
take
the
best
of
care
of
strefford
mused
his
eyes
upon
his
cigarette
but
what
the
deuce
led
up
to
all
this
it
can
t
have
happened
like
that
out
of
a
clear
susy
flushed
hesitated
looked
away
she
had
meant
to
tell
strefford
the
whole
story
it
had
been
one
of
her
chief
reasons
for
wishing
to
see
him
again
and
perhaps
she
had
hoped
in
his
laxer
atmosphere
to
recover
something
of
her
shattered
but
now
she
suddenly
felt
the
impossibility
of
confessing
to
anyone
the
depths
to
which
nick
s
wife
had
stooped
she
fancied
that
her
companion
guessed
the
nature
of
her
hesitation
don
t
tell
me
anything
you
don
t
want
to
you
know
my
no
i
do
want
to
only
it
s
difficult
you
see
we
had
so
very
little
money
yes
and
nick
who
was
thinking
of
his
book
and
of
all
sorts
of
big
things
fine
things
didn
t
realise
left
it
all
to
me
to
manage
she
stumbled
over
the
word
remembering
how
nick
had
always
winced
at
it
but
strefford
did
not
seem
to
notice
her
and
she
hurried
on
unfolding
in
short
awkward
sentences
the
avowal
of
their
pecuniary
difficulties
and
of
nick
s
inability
to
understand
that
to
keep
on
with
the
kind
of
life
they
were
leading
one
had
to
put
up
with
things
accept
favours
borrow
money
you
mean
well
yes
and
all
the
no
decidedly
she
could
not
reveal
to
strefford
the
episode
of
ellie
s
letters
nick
suddenly
felt
i
suppose
that
he
couldn
t
stand
it
she
continued
and
instead
of
asking
me
to
try
to
try
to
live
differently
go
off
somewhere
with
him
and
live
like
in
two
rooms
without
a
servant
as
i
was
ready
to
do
well
instead
he
wrote
me
that
it
had
all
been
a
mistake
from
the
beginning
that
we
couldn
t
keep
it
up
and
had
better
recognize
the
fact
and
he
went
off
on
the
hickses
yacht
the
last
evening
that
you
were
in
venice
the
day
he
didn
t
come
back
to
dinner
he
had
gone
off
to
genoa
to
meet
them
i
suppose
he
intends
to
marry
strefford
received
this
in
silence
well
it
was
your
bargain
wasn
t
it
he
said
at
length
yes
but
exactly
i
always
told
you
so
you
weren
t
ready
to
have
him
go
yet
that
s
she
flushed
to
the
forehead
oh
streff
is
it
really
all
a
question
of
time
if
you
doubt
it
i
d
like
to
see
you
try
for
a
while
in
those
two
rooms
without
a
servant
and
then
let
me
hear
from
you
why
my
dear
it
s
only
a
question
of
time
in
a
palace
with
a
steam
yacht
lying
off
the
and
a
flock
of
motors
in
the
garage
look
around
you
and
see
and
did
you
ever
imagine
that
you
and
nick
of
all
people
were
going
to
escape
the
common
doom
and
survive
like
and
tithonus
while
all
about
you
the
eternal
passions
were
crumbling
to
pieces
and
your
native
piling
up
their
revenues
she
sat
with
bent
head
the
weight
of
the
long
years
to
come
pressing
like
a
leaden
load
on
her
shoulders
but
i
m
so
young
life
s
so
long
what
does
last
then
ah
you
re
too
young
to
believe
me
if
i
were
to
tell
you
though
you
re
intelligent
enough
to
what
does
then
why
the
hold
of
the
things
we
all
think
we
could
do
without
habits
they
outstand
the
pyramids
comforts
luxuries
the
atmosphere
of
ease
above
all
the
power
to
get
away
from
dulness
and
monotony
from
constraints
and
uglinesses
you
chose
that
power
instinctively
before
you
were
even
grown
up
and
so
did
nick
and
the
only
difference
between
you
is
that
he
s
had
the
sense
to
see
sooner
than
you
that
those
are
the
things
that
last
the
prime
i
don
t
believe
it
of
course
you
don
t
at
your
age
one
doesn
t
reason
one
s
materialism
and
besides
you
re
mortally
hurt
that
nick
has
found
out
sooner
than
you
and
hasn
t
disguised
his
discovery
under
any
hypocritical
but
surely
there
are
people
yes
saints
and
geniuses
and
heroes
all
the
fanatics
to
which
of
their
categories
do
you
suppose
we
soft
people
belong
and
the
heroes
and
the
geniuses
haven
t
they
their
enormous
frailties
and
their
giant
appetites
and
how
should
we
escape
being
the
victims
of
our
little
ones
she
sat
for
a
while
without
speaking
but
streff
how
can
you
say
such
things
when
i
know
you
care
care
for
me
for
instance
care
he
put
his
hand
on
hers
but
my
dear
it
s
just
the
fugitiveness
of
mortal
caring
that
makes
it
so
exquisite
it
s
because
we
know
we
can
t
hold
fast
to
it
or
to
each
other
or
to
anything
yes
yes
but
hush
please
oh
don
t
say
it
she
stood
up
the
tears
in
her
throat
and
he
rose
also
come
along
then
where
do
we
lunch
he
said
with
a
smile
slipping
his
hand
through
her
arm
oh
i
don
t
know
nowhere
i
think
i
m
going
back
to
because
i
ve
disgusted
you
so
deeply
just
my
luck
when
i
came
over
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
she
laughed
but
he
had
become
suddenly
grave
upon
my
soul
i
dear
streff
as
if
now
oh
not
now
i
know
i
m
aware
that
even
with
your
accelerated
divorce
methods
it
s
not
that
i
told
you
it
was
no
use
streff
i
told
you
long
ago
in
he
shrugged
ironically
it
s
not
streff
who
s
asking
you
now
streff
was
not
a
marrying
man
he
was
only
trifling
with
you
the
present
offer
comes
from
an
elderly
peer
of
independent
means
think
it
over
my
dear
as
many
days
out
as
you
like
and
five
footmen
kept
there
s
not
the
least
hurry
of
course
but
i
rather
think
nick
himself
would
advise
she
flushed
to
the
temples
remembering
that
nick
had
and
the
remembrance
made
strefford
s
sneering
philosophy
seem
less
unbearable
why
should
she
not
lunch
with
him
after
all
in
the
first
days
of
his
mourning
he
had
come
to
paris
expressly
to
see
her
and
to
offer
her
one
of
the
oldest
names
and
one
of
the
greatest
fortunes
in
england
she
thought
of
ursula
gillow
ellie
vanderlyn
violet
melrose
of
their
condescending
kindnesses
their
last
year
s
dresses
their
christmas
cheques
and
all
the
careless
bounties
that
were
so
easy
to
bestow
and
so
hard
to
accept
i
should
rather
enjoy
paying
them
back
something
in
her
maliciously
murmured
she
did
not
mean
to
marry
strefford
she
had
not
even
got
as
far
as
contemplating
the
possibility
of
a
divorce
but
it
was
undeniable
that
this
sudden
prospect
of
wealth
and
freedom
was
like
fresh
air
in
her
lungs
she
laughed
again
but
now
without
bitterness
very
good
then
we
ll
lunch
together
but
it
s
streff
i
want
to
lunch
with
ah
well
her
companion
agreed
i
rather
think
that
for
a
he
s
better
during
their
repast
in
a
little
restaurant
over
the
seine
where
she
insisted
on
the
cheapest
dishes
because
she
was
lunching
with
streff
he
became
again
his
old
whimsical
companionable
self
once
or
twice
she
tried
to
turn
the
talk
to
his
altered
future
and
the
obligations
and
interests
that
lay
before
him
but
he
shrugged
away
from
the
subject
questioning
her
instead
about
the
motley
company
at
violet
melrose
s
and
fitting
a
droll
or
malicious
anecdote
to
each
of
the
people
she
named
it
was
not
till
they
had
finished
their
coffee
and
she
was
glancing
at
her
watch
with
a
vague
notion
of
taking
the
next
train
that
he
asked
abruptly
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
you
can
t
stay
forever
at
violet
oh
no
she
cried
with
a
shiver
well
then
you
ve
got
some
plan
i
suppose
have
i
she
wondered
jerked
back
into
grim
reality
from
the
soothing
interlude
of
their
hour
together
you
can
t
drift
indefinitely
can
you
unless
you
mean
to
go
back
to
the
old
sort
of
life
once
for
she
reddened
and
her
eyes
filled
i
can
t
do
that
streff
i
know
i
can
t
then
what
she
hesitated
and
brought
out
with
lowered
head
nick
said
he
would
write
again
in
a
few
days
i
must
wait
oh
naturally
don
t
do
anything
in
a
strefford
also
glanced
at
his
watch
garcon
l
addition
i
m
taking
the
train
back
and
i
ve
a
lot
of
things
left
to
do
but
look
here
my
dear
when
you
come
to
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other
let
me
know
will
you
oh
i
don
t
mean
in
the
matter
i
ve
most
at
heart
we
ll
consider
that
closed
for
the
present
but
at
least
i
can
be
of
use
in
other
ways
hang
it
you
know
i
can
even
lend
you
money
there
s
a
new
sensation
for
our
jaded
palates
oh
streff
streff
she
could
only
falter
and
he
pressed
on
gaily
try
it
now
do
try
it
i
assure
you
there
ll
be
no
interest
to
pay
and
no
conditions
attached
and
promise
to
let
me
know
when
you
ve
decided
she
looked
into
his
humorously
puckered
eyes
answering
their
friendly
smile
with
hers
i
promise
she
said
xv
that
hour
with
strefford
had
altered
her
whole
perspective
instead
of
possible
dependence
an
enforced
return
to
the
old
life
of
connivances
and
concessions
she
saw
before
her
whenever
she
chose
to
take
them
freedom
power
and
dignity
dignity
it
was
odd
what
weight
that
word
had
come
to
have
for
her
she
had
dimly
felt
its
significance
felt
the
need
of
its
presence
in
her
inmost
soul
even
in
the
young
thoughtless
days
when
she
had
seemed
to
sacrifice
so
little
to
the
austere
divinities
and
since
she
had
been
nick
lansing
s
wife
she
had
consciously
acknowledged
it
had
suffered
and
agonized
when
she
fell
beneath
its
standard
yes
to
marry
strefford
would
give
her
that
sense
of
which
in
such
a
world
as
theirs
only
wealth
and
position
could
ensure
if
she
had
not
the
mental
or
moral
training
to
attain
independence
in
any
other
way
was
she
to
blame
for
seeking
it
on
such
terms
of
course
there
was
always
the
chance
that
nick
would
come
back
would
find
life
without
her
as
intolerable
as
she
was
finding
it
without
him
if
that
happened
ah
if
that
happened
then
she
would
cease
to
strain
her
eyes
into
the
future
would
seize
upon
the
present
moment
and
plunge
into
it
to
the
very
bottom
of
oblivion
nothing
on
earth
would
matter
then
money
or
freedom
or
pride
or
her
precious
moral
dignity
if
only
she
were
in
nick
s
arms
again
but
there
was
nick
s
icy
letter
there
was
coral
hicks
s
insolent
to
show
how
little
chance
there
was
of
such
a
solution
susy
understood
that
even
before
the
discovery
of
her
transaction
with
ellie
vanderlyn
nick
had
secretly
wearied
if
not
of
his
wife
at
least
of
the
life
that
their
marriage
compelled
him
to
lead
his
passion
was
not
strong
enough
had
never
been
strong
enough
to
outweigh
his
prejudices
scruples
principles
or
whatever
one
chose
to
call
them
susy
s
dignity
might
go
up
like
tinder
in
the
blaze
of
her
love
but
his
was
made
of
a
less
combustible
substance
she
had
felt
in
their
last
talk
together
that
she
had
forever
destroyed
the
inner
harmony
between
them
well
there
it
was
and
the
fault
was
doubtless
neither
hers
nor
his
but
that
of
the
world
they
had
grown
up
in
of
their
own
moral
contempt
for
it
and
physical
dependence
on
it
of
his
and
her
of
the
something
in
them
both
that
was
not
stout
enough
to
resist
nor
yet
pliant
enough
to
yield
she
stared
at
the
fact
on
the
journey
back
to
versailles
and
all
that
sleepless
night
in
her
room
and
the
next
morning
when
the
housemaid
came
in
with
her
breakfast
tray
she
felt
the
factitious
energy
that
comes
from
having
decided
however
on
a
definite
course
she
had
said
to
herself
if
there
s
no
letter
from
nick
this
time
next
week
i
ll
write
to
streff
and
the
week
had
passed
and
there
was
no
letter
it
was
now
three
weeks
since
he
had
left
her
and
she
had
had
no
word
but
his
note
from
genoa
she
had
concluded
that
foreseeing
the
probability
of
her
leaving
venice
he
would
write
to
her
in
care
of
their
paris
bank
but
though
she
had
immediately
notified
the
bank
of
her
change
of
address
no
communication
from
nick
had
reached
her
and
she
smiled
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
difficulty
he
was
doubtless
finding
in
the
composition
of
the
promised
letter
her
own
for
the
first
days
had
been
heaped
with
the
fragments
of
the
letters
she
had
begun
and
she
told
herself
that
since
they
both
found
it
so
hard
to
write
it
was
probably
because
they
had
nothing
left
to
say
to
each
other
meanwhile
the
days
at
melrose
s
drifted
by
as
they
had
been
wont
to
drift
when
under
the
roofs
of
the
rich
susy
branch
had
marked
time
between
one
episode
and
the
next
of
her
precarious
existence
her
experience
of
such
sojourns
was
varied
enough
to
make
her
acutely
conscious
of
their
effect
on
her
temporary
hosts
and
in
the
present
case
she
knew
that
violet
was
hardly
aware
of
her
presence
but
if
no
more
than
tolerated
she
was
at
least
not
felt
to
be
an
inconvenience
when
your
hostess
forgot
about
you
it
proved
that
at
least
you
were
not
in
her
way
violet
as
usual
was
perpetually
on
the
wing
for
her
profound
indolence
expressed
itself
in
a
disordered
activity
nat
fulmer
had
returned
to
paris
but
susy
guessed
that
his
benefactress
was
still
constantly
in
his
company
and
that
when
melrose
was
whirled
away
in
her
noiseless
motor
it
was
generally
toward
the
scene
of
some
new
encounter
between
fulmer
and
the
arts
on
these
occasions
she
sometimes
offered
to
carry
susy
to
paris
and
they
devoted
several
long
and
hectic
mornings
to
the
where
susy
felt
herself
gradually
succumbing
to
the
familiar
spell
of
finery
it
seemed
impossible
as
furs
and
laces
and
brocades
were
tossed
aside
brought
back
and
at
last
carelessly
selected
from
that
anything
but
the
whim
of
the
moment
need
count
in
deciding
whether
one
should
take
all
or
none
or
that
any
woman
could
be
worth
looking
at
who
did
not
possess
the
means
to
make
her
choice
regardless
of
cost
once
alone
and
in
the
street
again
the
evil
fumes
would
evaporate
and
daylight
susy
s
soul
yet
she
felt
that
the
old
poison
was
slowly
insinuating
itself
into
her
system
to
dispel
it
she
decided
one
day
to
look
up
grace
fulmer
she
was
curious
to
know
how
the
companion
of
fulmer
s
evil
days
was
bearing
the
weight
of
his
prosperity
and
she
vaguely
felt
that
it
would
be
refreshing
to
see
some
one
who
had
never
been
afraid
of
poverty
the
airless
pension
where
she
waited
while
a
reluctant
screamed
about
the
house
for
fulmer
did
not
have
the
effect
it
was
one
thing
for
grace
to
put
up
with
such
quarters
when
she
shared
them
with
fulmer
but
to
live
there
while
he
basked
in
the
lingering
radiance
of
versailles
or
rolled
from
chateau
to
picture
gallery
in
melrose
s
motor
showed
a
courage
that
susy
felt
unable
to
emulate
my
dear
i
knew
you
d
look
me
up
grace
s
joyous
voice
ran
down
the
stairway
and
in
another
moment
she
was
clasping
susy
to
her
tumbled
person
nat
couldn
t
remember
if
he
d
given
you
our
address
though
he
promised
me
he
would
the
last
time
he
was
she
held
susy
at
arms
length
beaming
upon
her
with
blinking
eyes
the
same
old
dishevelled
grace
so
careless
of
her
neglected
beauty
and
her
squandered
youth
so
amused
and
and
improvident
that
the
boisterous
air
of
the
new
hampshire
bungalow
seemed
to
enter
with
her
into
the
little
salon
while
she
poured
out
the
tale
of
nat
s
sudden
celebrity
and
its
unexpected
consequences
susy
marvelled
and
dreamed
was
the
secret
of
his
triumph
perhaps
due
to
those
long
hard
unrewarded
years
the
steadfast
scorn
of
popularity
the
indifference
to
every
kind
of
material
ease
in
which
his
wife
had
so
gaily
abetted
him
had
it
been
bought
at
the
cost
of
her
own
freshness
and
her
own
talent
of
the
children
s
advantages
of
everything
except
the
closeness
of
the
tie
between
husband
and
wife
well
it
was
worth
the
price
no
doubt
but
what
if
now
that
honours
and
prosperity
had
come
the
tie
were
snapped
and
grace
were
left
alone
among
the
ruins
there
was
nothing
in
her
tone
or
words
to
suggest
such
a
possibility
susy
noticed
that
her
raiment
was
costlier
in
quality
and
more
professional
in
cut
than
the
garments
which
had
draped
her
growing
bulk
at
the
bungalow
it
was
clear
that
she
was
trying
to
dress
up
to
nat
s
new
situation
but
above
all
she
was
rejoicing
in
it
filling
her
hungry
lungs
with
the
strong
air
of
his
success
it
had
evidently
not
occurred
to
her
as
yet
that
those
who
consent
to
share
the
bread
of
adversity
may
want
the
whole
cake
of
prosperity
for
themselves
my
dear
it
s
too
wonderful
he
s
told
me
to
take
as
many
concert
and
opera
tickets
as
i
like
he
lets
me
take
all
the
children
with
me
the
big
concerts
don
t
begin
till
later
but
of
course
the
opera
is
always
going
and
there
are
little
things
there
s
music
in
paris
at
all
seasons
and
later
it
s
just
possible
we
may
get
to
munich
for
a
week
oh
susy
her
hands
clasped
her
eyes
brimming
she
drank
the
new
wine
of
life
almost
sacramentally
do
you
remember
susy
when
you
and
nick
came
to
stay
at
the
bungalow
nat
said
you
d
be
horrified
by
our
primitiveness
but
i
knew
better
and
i
was
right
wasn
t
i
seeing
us
so
happy
made
you
and
nick
decide
to
follow
our
example
didn
t
it
she
glowed
with
the
remembrance
and
now
what
are
your
plans
is
nick
s
book
nearly
done
i
suppose
you
ll
have
to
live
very
economically
till
he
finds
a
publisher
and
the
baby
darling
when
is
that
to
be
if
you
re
coming
home
soon
i
could
let
you
have
a
lot
of
the
children
s
little
old
you
re
always
so
dear
grace
but
we
haven
t
any
special
plans
as
yet
not
even
for
a
baby
and
i
wish
you
d
tell
me
all
of
yours
fulmer
asked
nothing
better
susy
perceived
that
so
far
the
greater
part
of
her
european
experience
had
consisted
in
talking
about
what
it
was
to
be
well
you
see
nat
is
so
taken
up
all
day
with
and
galleries
and
meeting
important
people
that
he
hasn
t
had
time
to
go
about
with
us
and
as
so
few
theatres
are
open
and
there
s
so
little
music
i
ve
taken
the
opportunity
to
catch
up
with
my
mending
junie
helps
me
with
it
now
she
s
our
eldest
you
remember
she
s
grown
into
a
big
girl
since
you
saw
her
and
later
perhaps
we
re
to
travel
and
the
most
wonderful
thing
of
all
next
to
nat
s
recognition
i
mean
is
not
having
to
contrive
and
skimp
and
give
up
something
every
single
minute
just
think
nat
has
even
made
special
arrangements
here
in
the
pension
so
that
the
children
all
have
second
helpings
to
everything
and
when
i
go
up
to
bed
i
can
think
of
my
music
instead
of
lying
awake
calculating
and
wondering
how
i
can
make
things
come
out
at
the
end
of
the
month
oh
susy
that
s
simply
heaven
susy
s
heart
contracted
she
had
come
to
her
friend
to
be
taught
again
the
lesson
of
indifference
to
material
things
and
instead
she
was
hearing
from
grace
fulmer
s
lips
the
avowal
of
their
tyranny
after
all
that
battle
with
poverty
on
the
new
hampshire
hillside
had
not
been
the
easy
smiling
business
that
grace
and
nat
had
made
it
appear
and
yet
and
yet
susy
stood
up
abruptly
and
straightened
the
expensive
hat
which
hung
irresponsibly
over
grace
s
left
ear
what
s
wrong
with
it
junie
helped
me
choose
it
and
she
generally
knows
fulmer
wailed
with
helpless
hands
it
s
the
way
you
wear
it
dearest
and
the
bow
is
rather
let
me
have
it
a
minute
susy
lifted
the
hat
from
her
friend
s
head
and
began
to
manipulate
its
trimming
this
is
the
way
maria
guy
or
suzanne
would
do
it
and
now
go
on
about
nat
she
listened
musingly
while
grace
poured
forth
the
tale
of
her
husband
s
triumph
of
the
notices
in
the
papers
the
demand
for
his
work
the
fine
ladies
battles
over
their
priority
in
discovering
him
and
the
multiplied
orders
that
had
resulted
from
their
rivalry
of
course
they
re
simply
furious
with
each
other
melrose
and
gillow
especially
because
each
one
pretends
to
have
been
the
first
to
notice
his
spring
and
in
reality
it
wasn
t
either
of
them
but
only
poor
bill
haslett
an
we
ve
known
for
years
who
chanced
on
the
picture
and
rushed
off
to
tell
a
dealer
who
was
looking
for
a
new
painter
to
grace
suddenly
raised
her
soft
myopic
eyes
to
susy
s
face
but
do
you
know
the
funny
thing
is
that
i
believe
nat
is
beginning
to
forget
this
and
to
believe
that
it
was
melrose
who
stopped
short
in
front
of
his
picture
on
the
opening
day
and
screamed
out
this
is
genius
it
seems
funny
he
should
care
so
much
when
i
ve
always
known
he
had
genius
and
he
has
known
it
too
but
they
re
all
so
kind
to
him
and
melrose
especially
and
i
suppose
it
makes
a
thing
sound
new
to
hear
it
said
in
a
new
susy
looked
at
her
meditatively
and
how
should
you
feel
if
nat
liked
too
much
to
hear
melrose
say
it
too
much
i
mean
to
care
any
longer
what
you
felt
or
thought
her
friend
s
worn
face
flushed
quickly
and
then
paled
susy
almost
repented
the
question
but
fulmer
met
it
with
a
tranquil
dignity
you
haven
t
been
married
long
enough
dear
to
understand
how
people
like
nat
and
me
feel
about
such
things
or
how
trifling
they
seem
in
the
balance
the
balance
of
one
s
susy
stood
up
again
and
flung
her
arms
about
her
friend
oh
grace
she
laughed
with
wet
eyes
how
can
you
be
as
wise
as
that
and
yet
not
have
sense
enough
to
buy
a
decent
hat
she
gave
fulmer
a
quick
embrace
and
hurried
away
she
had
learned
her
lesson
after
all
but
it
was
not
exactly
the
one
she
had
come
to
seek
the
week
she
had
allowed
herself
had
passed
and
still
there
was
no
word
from
nick
she
allowed
herself
yet
another
day
and
that
too
went
by
without
a
letter
she
then
decided
on
a
step
from
which
her
pride
had
hitherto
recoiled
she
would
call
at
the
bank
and
ask
for
nick
s
address
she
called
embarrassed
and
hesitating
and
was
told
after
enquiries
in
the
department
that
nicholas
lansing
had
given
no
address
since
that
of
the
palazzo
vanderlyn
three
months
previously
she
went
back
to
versailles
that
afternoon
with
the
definite
intention
of
writing
to
strefford
unless
the
next
morning
s
post
brought
a
letter
the
next
morning
brought
nothing
from
nick
but
a
scribbled
message
from
melrose
would
susy
as
soon
as
possible
come
into
her
room
for
a
word
susy
jumped
up
hurried
through
her
bath
and
knocked
at
her
hostess
s
door
in
the
immense
low
bed
that
faced
the
rich
umbrage
of
the
park
melrose
lay
smoking
cigarettes
and
glancing
over
her
letters
she
looked
up
with
her
vague
smile
and
said
dreamily
susy
darling
have
you
any
particular
plans
for
the
next
few
months
i
mean
susy
coloured
she
knew
the
intonation
of
old
and
fancied
she
understood
what
it
implied
plans
dearest
any
number
i
m
tearing
myself
away
the
day
after
to
the
gillows
moor
very
probably
she
hastened
to
announce
instead
of
the
relief
she
had
expected
to
read
on
melrose
s
dramatic
countenance
she
discovered
there
the
blankest
disappointment
oh
really
that
s
too
bad
is
it
absolutely
settled
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
said
susy
crisply
the
other
sighed
i
m
too
sorry
you
see
dear
i
d
meant
to
ask
you
to
stay
on
here
quietly
and
look
after
the
fulmer
children
fulmer
and
i
are
going
to
spain
next
week
i
want
to
be
with
him
when
he
makes
his
studies
receives
his
first
impressions
such
a
marvellous
experience
to
be
there
when
he
and
velasquez
meet
she
broke
off
lost
in
prospective
ecstasy
and
you
see
as
grace
fulmer
insists
on
coming
with
us
ah
i
well
there
are
the
five
children
such
a
problem
sighed
the
benefactress
if
you
were
at
a
loose
end
you
know
dear
while
nick
s
away
with
his
friends
i
could
really
make
it
worth
your
while
so
awfully
good
of
you
violet
only
i
m
not
as
it
oh
the
relief
of
being
able
to
say
that
gaily
firmly
and
even
truthfully
take
charge
of
the
fulmer
children
indeed
susy
remembered
how
nick
and
she
had
fled
from
them
that
autumn
afternoon
in
new
hampshire
the
offer
gave
her
a
salutary
glimpse
of
the
way
in
which
as
the
years
passed
and
she
lost
her
freshness
and
novelty
she
would
more
and
more
be
used
as
a
convenience
a
writer
of
notes
runner
of
errands
nursery
governess
or
companion
she
called
to
mind
several
elderly
women
of
her
acquaintance
pensioners
of
her
own
group
who
still
wore
its
livery
struck
its
attitudes
and
chattered
its
jargon
but
had
long
since
been
ruthlessly
relegated
to
these
offices
never
in
the
world
would
she
join
their
numbers
melrose
s
face
fell
and
she
looked
at
susy
with
the
plaintive
bewilderment
of
the
wielder
of
millions
to
whom
everything
that
can
not
be
bought
is
imperceptible
but
i
can
t
see
why
you
can
t
change
your
plans
she
murmured
with
a
soft
persistency
ah
well
you
know
susy
paused
on
a
slow
inward
smile
they
re
not
mine
only
as
it
melrose
s
brow
clouded
the
unforeseen
complication
of
fulmer
s
presence
on
the
journey
had
evidently
tried
her
nerves
and
this
new
obstacle
to
her
arrangements
shook
her
faith
in
the
divine
order
of
things
your
plans
are
not
yours
only
but
surely
you
won
t
let
ursula
gillow
dictate
to
you
there
s
my
jade
pendant
the
one
you
said
you
liked
the
other
day
the
fulmers
won
t
go
with
me
you
understand
unless
they
re
satisfied
about
the
children
the
whole
plan
will
fall
through
susy
darling
you
were
always
too
unselfish
i
hate
to
see
you
sacrificed
to
susy
s
smile
lingered
time
was
when
she
might
have
been
glad
to
add
the
jade
pendant
to
the
collection
already
enriched
by
ellie
vanderlyn
s
sapphires
more
recently
she
would
have
resented
the
offer
as
an
insult
to
her
principles
but
already
the
mere
fact
that
she
might
henceforth
if
she
chose
be
utterly
out
of
reach
of
such
bribes
enabled
her
to
look
down
on
them
with
tolerance
oh
the
blessed
moral
freedom
that
wealth
conferred
she
recalled
fulmer
s
uncontrollable
cry
the
most
wonderful
thing
of
all
is
not
having
to
contrive
and
skimp
and
give
up
something
every
single
minute
yes
it
was
only
on
such
terms
that
one
could
call
one
s
soul
one
s
own
the
sense
of
it
gave
susy
the
grace
to
answer
amicably
if
i
could
possibly
help
you
out
violet
i
shouldn
t
want
a
present
to
persuade
me
and
as
you
say
there
s
no
reason
why
i
should
sacrifice
myself
to
ursula
or
to
anybody
else
only
as
it
happens
she
paused
and
took
the
plunge
i
m
going
to
england
because
i
ve
promised
to
see
a
that
night
she
wrote
to
strefford
xvi
stretched
out
under
an
awning
on
the
deck
of
the
ibis
nick
lansing
looked
up
for
a
moment
at
the
vanishing
cliffs
of
malta
and
then
plunged
again
into
his
book
he
had
had
nearly
three
weeks
of
on
the
ibis
the
drugs
he
had
absorbed
were
of
two
kinds
visions
of
fleeing
landscapes
looming
up
from
the
blue
sea
to
vanish
into
it
again
and
visions
of
study
absorbed
from
the
volumes
piled
up
day
and
night
at
his
elbow
for
the
first
time
in
months
he
was
in
reach
of
a
real
library
just
the
kind
of
scholarly
yet
miscellaneous
library
that
his
restless
and
impatient
spirit
craved
he
was
aware
that
the
books
he
read
like
the
fugitive
scenes
on
which
he
gazed
were
merely
a
form
of
anesthetic
he
swallowed
them
with
the
careless
greed
of
the
sufferer
who
seeks
only
to
still
pain
and
deaden
memory
but
they
were
beginning
to
produce
in
him
a
moral
languor
that
was
not
disagreeable
that
indeed
compared
with
the
fierce
pain
of
the
first
days
was
almost
pleasurable
it
was
exactly
the
kind
of
drug
that
he
needed
there
is
probably
no
point
on
which
the
average
man
has
more
definite
views
than
on
the
uselessness
of
writing
a
letter
that
is
hard
to
write
in
the
line
he
had
sent
to
susy
from
genoa
nick
had
told
her
that
she
would
hear
from
him
again
in
a
few
days
but
when
the
few
days
had
passed
and
he
began
to
consider
setting
himself
to
the
task
he
found
fifty
reasons
for
postponing
it
had
there
been
any
practical
questions
to
write
about
it
would
have
been
different
he
could
not
have
borne
for
hours
the
idea
that
she
was
in
uncertainty
as
to
money
but
that
had
all
been
settled
long
ago
from
the
first
she
had
had
the
administering
of
their
modest
fortune
on
their
marriage
nick
s
own
meagre
income
paid
in
none
too
regularly
by
the
agent
who
had
managed
for
years
the
dwindling
family
properties
had
been
transferred
to
her
it
was
the
only
wedding
present
he
could
make
and
the
wedding
cheques
had
of
course
all
been
deposited
in
her
name
there
were
therefore
no
business
reasons
for
communicating
with
her
and
when
it
came
to
reasons
of
another
order
the
mere
thought
of
them
benumbed
him
for
the
first
few
days
he
reproached
himself
for
his
inertia
then
he
began
to
seek
reasons
for
justifying
it
after
all
for
both
their
sakes
a
waiting
policy
might
be
the
wisest
he
could
pursue
he
had
left
susy
because
he
could
not
tolerate
the
conditions
on
which
he
had
discovered
their
life
together
to
be
based
and
he
had
told
her
so
what
more
was
there
to
say
nothing
was
changed
in
their
respective
situations
if
they
came
together
it
could
be
only
to
resume
the
same
life
and
that
as
the
days
went
by
seemed
to
him
more
and
more
impossible
he
had
not
yet
reached
the
point
of
facing
a
definite
separation
but
whenever
his
thoughts
travelled
back
over
their
past
life
he
recoiled
from
any
attempt
to
return
to
it
as
long
as
this
state
of
mind
continued
there
seemed
nothing
to
add
to
the
letter
he
had
already
written
except
indeed
the
statement
that
he
was
cruising
with
the
hickses
and
he
saw
no
pressing
reason
for
communicating
that
to
the
hickses
he
had
given
no
hint
of
his
situation
when
coral
hicks
a
fortnight
earlier
had
picked
him
up
in
the
broiling
streets
of
genoa
and
carried
him
off
to
the
ibis
he
had
thought
only
of
a
cool
dinner
and
perhaps
a
moonlight
sail
then
in
reply
to
their
friendly
urging
he
had
confessed
that
he
had
not
been
well
had
indeed
gone
off
hurriedly
for
a
few
days
change
of
air
and
that
left
him
without
defence
against
the
immediate
proposal
that
he
should
take
his
change
of
air
on
the
ibis
they
were
just
off
to
corsica
and
sardinia
and
from
there
to
sicily
he
could
rejoin
the
railway
at
naples
and
be
back
at
venice
in
ten
days
ten
days
of
respite
the
temptation
was
irresistible
and
he
really
liked
the
kind
uncomplicated
hickses
a
wholesome
honesty
and
simplicity
breathed
through
all
their
opulence
as
if
the
rich
trappings
of
their
present
life
still
exhaled
the
fragrance
of
their
native
prairies
the
mere
fact
of
being
with
such
people
was
like
a
purifying
bath
when
the
yacht
touched
at
naples
he
agreed
since
they
were
so
awfully
kind
to
go
on
to
sicily
and
when
the
chief
steward
going
ashore
at
naples
for
the
last
time
before
they
got
up
steam
said
any
letters
for
the
post
sir
he
answered
as
he
had
answered
at
each
previous
halt
no
thank
you
now
they
were
heading
for
rhodes
and
crete
crete
where
he
had
never
been
where
he
had
so
often
longed
to
go
in
spite
of
the
lateness
of
the
season
the
weather
was
still
miraculously
fine
the
short
waves
danced
ahead
under
a
sky
without
a
cloud
and
the
strong
bows
of
the
ibis
hardly
swayed
as
she
flew
forward
over
the
flying
crests
only
his
hosts
and
their
daughter
were
on
the
yacht
of
course
with
eldorada
tooker
and
beck
in
attendance
an
eminent
archaeologist
who
was
to
have
joined
them
at
naples
had
telegraphed
an
excuse
at
the
last
moment
and
nick
noticed
that
while
hicks
was
perpetually
apologizing
for
the
great
man
s
absence
coral
merely
smiled
and
said
nothing
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
hicks
were
never
as
pleasant
as
when
one
had
them
to
one
s
self
in
company
hicks
ran
the
risk
of
appearing
and
hicks
confused
dates
and
names
in
the
desire
to
embrace
all
culture
in
her
conversation
but
alone
with
nick
their
old
they
shone
out
in
their
native
simplicity
and
hicks
talked
soundly
of
investments
and
hicks
recalled
her
early
married
days
in
apex
city
when
on
being
brought
home
to
her
new
house
in
aeschylus
avenue
her
first
thought
had
been
how
on
earth
shall
i
get
all
those
windows
washed
the
loss
of
buttles
had
been
as
serious
to
them
as
nick
had
supposed
beck
could
never
hope
to
replace
him
apart
from
his
mysterious
gift
of
languages
and
his
almost
superhuman
faculty
for
knowing
how
to
address
letters
to
eminent
people
and
in
what
terms
to
conclude
them
he
had
a
smattering
of
archaeology
and
general
culture
on
which
hicks
had
learned
to
depend
her
own
memory
being
alas
so
inadequate
to
the
range
of
her
interests
her
daughter
might
perhaps
have
helped
her
but
it
was
not
miss
hicks
s
way
to
mother
her
parents
she
was
exceedingly
kind
to
them
but
left
them
as
it
were
to
bring
themselves
up
as
best
they
could
while
she
pursued
her
own
course
of
a
sombre
zeal
for
knowledge
filled
the
mind
of
this
strange
girl
she
appeared
interested
only
in
fresh
opportunities
of
adding
to
her
store
of
facts
they
were
illuminated
by
little
imagination
and
less
poetry
but
carefully
catalogued
and
neatly
sorted
in
her
large
cool
brain
they
were
always
as
accessible
as
the
volumes
in
an
public
library
to
nick
there
was
something
reposeful
in
this
lucid
intellectual
curiosity
he
wanted
above
all
things
to
get
away
from
sentiment
from
seduction
from
the
moods
and
impulses
and
flashing
contradictions
that
were
susy
susy
was
not
a
great
reader
her
store
of
facts
was
small
and
she
had
grown
up
among
people
who
dreaded
ideas
as
much
as
if
they
had
been
a
contagious
disease
but
in
the
early
days
especially
when
nick
had
put
a
book
in
her
hand
or
read
a
poem
to
her
her
swift
intelligence
had
instantly
shed
a
new
light
on
the
subject
and
penetrating
to
its
depths
had
extracted
from
them
whatever
belonged
to
her
what
a
pity
that
this
exquisite
insight
this
intuitive
discrimination
should
for
the
most
part
have
been
spent
upon
reading
the
thoughts
of
vulgar
people
and
extracting
a
profit
from
them
should
have
been
wasted
since
her
childhood
on
all
the
hideous
intricacies
of
managing
and
visible
beauty
how
she
cared
for
that
too
he
had
not
guessed
it
or
rather
he
had
not
been
sure
of
it
till
the
day
when
on
their
way
through
paris
he
had
taken
her
to
the
louvre
and
they
had
stood
before
the
little
crucifixion
of
mantegna
he
had
not
been
looking
at
the
picture
or
watching
to
see
what
impression
it
produced
on
susy
his
own
momentary
mood
was
for
correggio
and
fragonard
the
laughter
of
the
music
lesson
and
the
bold
pagan
joys
of
the
antiope
and
then
he
had
missed
her
from
his
side
and
when
he
came
to
where
she
stood
forgetting
him
forgetting
everything
had
seen
the
glare
of
that
tragic
sky
in
her
face
her
trembling
lip
the
tears
on
her
lashes
that
was
susy
closing
his
book
he
stole
a
glance
at
coral
hicks
s
profile
thrown
back
against
the
cushions
of
the
at
his
side
there
was
something
harsh
and
bracing
in
her
blunt
primitive
build
in
the
projection
of
the
black
eyebrows
that
nearly
met
over
her
thick
straight
nose
and
the
faint
barely
visible
black
down
on
her
upper
lip
some
miracle
of
combined
with
all
the
artifices
that
wealth
can
buy
had
turned
the
fat
sallow
girl
he
remembered
into
this
commanding
young
woman
almost
handsome
at
times
indisputably
handsome
in
her
big
authoritative
way
watching
the
arrogant
lines
of
her
profile
against
the
blue
sea
he
remembered
with
a
thrill
that
was
sweet
to
his
vanity
how
twice
under
the
dome
of
the
scalzi
and
in
the
streets
of
genoa
he
had
seen
those
same
lines
soften
at
his
approach
turn
womanly
pleading
and
almost
humble
that
was
coral
suddenly
she
said
without
turning
toward
him
you
ve
had
no
letters
since
you
ve
been
on
he
looked
at
her
surprised
no
thank
the
lord
he
laughed
and
you
haven
t
written
one
either
she
continued
in
her
hard
statistical
tone
no
he
again
agreed
with
the
same
laugh
that
means
that
you
really
are
free
free
he
saw
the
cheek
nearest
him
redden
really
off
on
a
holiday
i
mean
not
tied
after
a
pause
he
rejoined
no
i
m
not
particularly
tied
and
your
book
oh
my
book
he
stopped
and
considered
he
had
thrust
the
pageant
of
alexander
into
his
handbag
on
the
night
of
his
bight
from
venice
but
since
then
he
had
never
looked
at
it
too
many
memories
and
illusions
were
pressed
between
its
pages
and
he
knew
just
at
what
page
he
had
felt
ellie
vanderlyn
bending
over
him
from
behind
caught
a
whiff
of
her
scent
and
heard
her
breathless
i
had
to
thank
you
my
book
s
hung
up
he
said
impatiently
annoyed
with
miss
hicks
s
lack
of
tact
there
was
a
girl
who
never
put
out
feelers
yes
i
thought
it
was
she
went
on
quietly
and
he
gave
her
a
startled
glance
what
the
devil
else
did
she
think
he
wondered
he
had
never
supposed
her
capable
of
getting
far
enough
out
of
her
own
thick
carapace
of
to
penetrate
into
any
one
else
s
feelings
the
truth
is
he
continued
embarrassed
i
suppose
i
dug
away
at
it
rather
too
continuously
that
s
probably
why
i
felt
the
need
of
a
change
you
see
i
m
only
a
she
still
continued
her
relentless
questioning
but
later
you
ll
go
on
with
it
of
course
oh
i
don
t
he
paused
glanced
down
the
glittering
deck
and
then
out
across
the
glittering
water
i
ve
been
dreaming
dreams
you
see
i
rather
think
i
shall
have
to
drop
the
book
altogether
and
try
to
look
out
for
a
job
that
will
pay
to
indulge
in
my
kind
of
literature
one
must
first
have
an
assured
he
was
instantly
annoyed
with
himself
for
having
spoken
hitherto
in
his
relations
with
the
hickses
he
had
carefully
avoided
the
least
allusion
that
might
make
him
feel
the
heavy
hand
of
their
beneficence
but
the
idle
procrastinating
weeks
had
weakened
him
and
he
had
yielded
to
the
need
of
putting
into
words
his
vague
intentions
to
do
so
would
perhaps
help
to
make
them
more
definite
to
his
relief
miss
hicks
made
no
immediate
reply
and
when
she
spoke
it
was
in
a
softer
voice
and
with
an
unwonted
hesitation
it
seems
a
shame
that
with
gifts
like
yours
you
shouldn
t
find
some
kind
of
employment
that
would
leave
you
leisure
enough
to
do
your
real
work
he
shrugged
ironically
yes
there
are
a
goodish
number
of
us
hunting
for
that
particular
kind
of
her
tone
became
more
i
know
it
s
hard
to
find
almost
impossible
but
would
you
take
it
i
wonder
if
it
were
offered
to
you
she
turned
her
head
slightly
and
their
eyes
met
for
an
instant
blank
terror
loomed
upon
him
but
before
he
had
time
to
face
it
she
continued
in
the
same
untroubled
voice
mr
buttles
s
place
i
mean
my
parents
must
absolutely
have
some
one
they
can
count
on
you
know
what
an
easy
place
it
is
i
think
you
would
find
the
salary
nick
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
for
a
moment
her
eyes
had
looked
as
they
had
in
the
scalzi
and
he
liked
the
girl
too
much
not
to
shrink
from
reawakening
that
look
but
buttles
s
place
why
not
poor
buttles
he
murmured
to
gain
time
oh
she
said
you
won
t
find
the
same
reasons
as
he
did
for
throwing
up
the
job
he
was
the
martyr
of
his
artistic
he
glanced
at
her
sideways
wondering
after
all
she
did
not
know
of
his
meeting
with
buttles
in
genoa
nor
of
the
latter
s
confidences
perhaps
she
did
not
even
know
of
buttles
s
hopeless
passion
at
any
rate
her
face
remained
calm
why
not
consider
it
at
least
just
for
a
few
months
till
after
our
expedition
to
mesopotamia
she
pressed
on
a
little
breathlessly
you
re
awfully
kind
but
i
don
t
know
she
stood
up
with
one
of
her
abrupt
movements
you
needn
t
all
at
once
take
time
think
it
over
father
wanted
me
to
ask
you
she
appended
he
felt
the
inadequacy
of
his
response
it
tempts
me
awfully
of
course
but
i
must
wait
at
any
rate
wait
for
letters
the
fact
is
i
shall
have
to
wire
from
rhodes
to
have
them
sent
i
had
chucked
everything
even
letters
for
a
few
ah
you
are
tired
she
murmured
giving
him
a
last
downward
glance
as
she
turned
away
from
rhodes
nick
lansing
telegraphed
to
his
paris
bank
to
send
his
letters
to
candia
but
when
the
ibis
reached
candia
and
the
mail
was
brought
on
board
the
thick
envelope
handed
to
him
contained
no
letter
from
susy
why
should
it
since
he
had
not
yet
written
to
her
he
had
not
written
no
but
in
sending
his
address
to
the
bank
he
knew
he
had
given
her
the
opportunity
of
reaching
him
if
she
wished
to
and
she
had
made
no
sign
late
that
afternoon
when
they
returned
to
the
yacht
from
their
first
expedition
a
packet
of
newspapers
lay
on
the
table
nick
picked
up
one
of
the
london
journals
and
his
eye
ran
absently
down
the
list
of
social
events
he
read
among
the
visitors
expected
next
week
at
ruan
castle
let
for
the
season
to
frederick
gillow
of
new
york
are
prince
altineri
of
rome
the
earl
of
altringham
and
nicholas
lansing
who
arrived
in
london
last
week
from
nick
threw
down
the
paper
it
was
just
a
month
since
he
had
left
the
palazzo
vanderlyn
and
flung
himself
into
the
night
express
for
milan
a
whole
month
and
susy
had
not
written
only
a
month
and
susy
and
strefford
were
already
together
xvii
susy
had
decided
to
wait
for
strefford
in
london
the
new
lord
altringham
was
with
his
family
in
the
north
and
though
she
found
a
telegram
on
arriving
saying
that
he
would
join
her
in
town
the
following
week
she
had
still
an
interval
of
several
days
to
fill
london
was
a
desert
the
rain
fell
without
ceasing
and
alone
in
the
shabby
family
hotel
which
even
out
of
season
was
the
best
she
could
afford
she
sat
at
last
face
to
face
with
herself
from
the
moment
when
violet
melrose
had
failed
to
carry
out
her
plan
for
the
fulmer
children
her
interest
in
susy
had
visibly
waned
often
before
in
the
old
days
susy
branch
had
felt
the
same
abrupt
change
of
temperature
in
the
manner
of
the
hostess
of
the
moment
and
often
how
often
had
yielded
and
performed
the
required
service
rather
than
risk
the
consequences
of
estrangement
to
that
at
least
thank
heaven
she
need
never
stoop
again
but
as
she
hurriedly
packed
her
trunks
at
versailles
scraped
together
an
adequate
tip
for
mrs
match
and
bade
to
violet
grown
suddenly
fond
and
demonstrative
as
she
saw
her
visitor
safely
headed
for
the
station
as
susy
went
through
the
old
familiar
mummery
of
the
enforced
there
rose
in
her
so
deep
a
disgust
for
the
life
of
makeshifts
and
accommodations
that
if
at
that
moment
nick
had
reappeared
and
held
out
his
arms
to
her
she
was
not
sure
she
would
have
had
the
courage
to
return
to
them
in
her
london
solitude
the
thirst
for
independence
grew
fiercer
independence
with
ease
of
course
oh
her
hateful
useless
love
of
beauty
the
curse
it
had
always
been
to
her
the
blessing
it
might
have
been
if
only
she
had
had
the
material
means
to
gratify
and
to
express
it
and
instead
it
only
gave
her
a
morbid
loathing
of
that
hideous
hotel
bedroom
drowned
in
yellow
of
the
smell
of
soot
and
cabbage
through
the
window
the
blistered
the
dusty
wax
bouquets
under
glass
globes
and
the
electric
lighting
so
contrived
that
as
you
turned
on
the
feeble
globe
hanging
from
the
middle
of
the
ceiling
the
feebler
one
beside
the
bed
went
out
what
a
sham
world
she
and
nick
had
lived
in
during
their
few
months
together
what
right
had
either
of
them
to
those
exquisite
settings
of
the
life
of
leisure
the
long
white
house
hidden
in
camellias
and
cypresses
above
the
lake
or
the
great
rooms
on
the
giudecca
with
the
shimmer
of
the
canal
always
playing
over
their
frescoed
ceilings
yet
she
had
come
to
imagine
that
these
places
really
belonged
to
them
that
they
would
always
go
on
living
fondly
and
irreproachably
in
the
frame
of
other
people
s
wealth
that
again
was
the
curse
of
her
love
of
beauty
the
way
she
always
took
to
it
as
if
it
belonged
to
her
well
the
awakening
was
bound
to
come
and
it
was
perhaps
better
that
it
should
have
come
so
soon
at
any
rate
there
was
no
use
in
letting
her
thoughts
wander
back
to
that
shattered
fool
s
paradise
of
theirs
only
as
she
sat
there
and
reckoned
up
the
days
till
strefford
arrived
what
else
in
the
world
was
there
to
think
of
her
future
and
his
but
she
knew
that
future
by
heart
already
she
had
not
spent
her
life
among
the
rich
and
fashionable
without
having
learned
every
detail
of
the
trappings
of
a
rich
and
fashionable
marriage
she
had
calculated
long
ago
just
how
many
how
many
and
how
much
lacy
lingerie
would
go
to
make
up
the
outfit
of
the
future
countess
of
altringham
she
had
even
decided
to
which
dressmaker
she
would
go
for
her
chinchilla
cloak
for
she
meant
to
have
one
and
down
to
her
feet
and
softer
and
more
voluminous
and
more
extravagantly
sumptuous
than
violet
s
or
ursula
s
not
to
speak
of
silver
foxes
and
sables
nor
yet
of
the
altringham
jewels
she
knew
all
this
by
heart
had
always
known
it
it
all
belonged
to
the
of
the
life
of
elegance
there
was
nothing
new
about
it
what
had
been
new
to
her
was
just
that
short
interval
with
nick
a
life
unreal
indeed
in
its
setting
but
so
real
in
its
essentials
the
one
reality
she
had
ever
known
as
she
looked
back
on
it
she
saw
how
much
it
had
given
her
besides
the
golden
flush
of
her
happiness
the
sudden
flowering
of
sensuous
joy
in
heart
and
body
yes
there
had
been
the
flowering
too
in
pain
like
of
something
graver
stronger
fuller
of
future
power
something
she
had
hardly
heeded
in
her
first
light
rapture
but
that
always
came
back
and
possessed
her
stilled
soul
when
the
rapture
sank
the
deep
disquieting
sense
of
something
that
nick
and
love
had
taught
her
but
that
reached
out
even
beyond
love
and
beyond
nick
her
nerves
were
racked
by
the
ceaseless
swish
swish
of
the
rain
on
the
dirty
panes
and
the
smell
of
cabbage
and
coal
that
came
in
under
the
door
when
she
shut
the
window
this
nauseating
foretaste
of
the
luncheon
she
must
presently
go
down
to
was
more
than
she
could
bear
it
brought
with
it
a
vision
of
the
dank
below
the
sooty
smyrna
rug
the
rain
on
the
the
listless
waitresses
handing
about
food
that
tasted
as
if
it
had
been
rained
on
too
there
was
really
no
reason
why
she
should
let
such
material
miseries
add
to
her
depression
she
sprang
up
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
and
calling
for
a
taxi
drove
to
the
london
branch
of
the
nouveau
luxe
hotel
it
was
just
one
o
clock
and
she
was
sure
to
pick
up
a
luncheon
for
though
london
was
empty
that
great
establishment
was
not
it
never
was
along
those
sultry
halls
in
that
great
flowered
and
scented
there
was
always
a
of
rich
aimless
people
the
busy
people
who
having
nothing
to
do
perpetually
pursue
their
inexorable
task
from
one
end
of
the
earth
to
the
other
oh
the
monotony
of
those
faces
the
faces
one
always
knew
whether
one
knew
the
people
they
belonged
to
or
not
a
fresh
disgust
seized
her
at
the
sight
of
them
she
wavered
and
then
turned
and
fled
but
on
the
threshold
a
still
more
familiar
figure
met
her
that
of
a
lady
in
exaggerated
pearls
and
sables
descending
from
an
exaggerated
motor
like
the
motors
in
magazine
advertisements
the
huge
arks
in
which
jewelled
beauties
and
slender
youths
pause
to
gaze
at
snowpeaks
from
an
alpine
summit
it
was
ursula
gillow
dear
old
ursula
on
her
way
to
scotland
and
she
and
susy
fell
on
each
other
s
necks
it
appeared
that
ursula
detained
till
the
next
evening
by
a
s
delay
was
also
out
of
a
job
and
killing
time
and
the
two
were
soon
smiling
at
each
other
over
the
exquisite
preliminaries
of
a
luncheon
which
the
had
authoritatively
asked
gillow
to
leave
to
him
as
ursula
was
in
a
good
humour
it
did
not
often
happen
but
when
it
did
her
benevolence
knew
no
bounds
like
melrose
like
all
her
tribe
in
fact
she
was
too
much
absorbed
in
her
own
affairs
to
give
more
than
a
passing
thought
to
any
one
else
s
but
she
was
delighted
at
the
meeting
with
susy
as
her
wandering
kind
always
were
when
they
ran
across
unless
the
meeting
happened
to
interfere
with
choicer
pleasures
not
to
be
alone
was
the
urgent
thing
and
ursula
who
had
been
hours
alone
in
london
at
once
exacted
from
her
friend
a
promise
that
they
should
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
together
but
once
the
bargain
struck
her
mind
turned
again
to
her
own
affairs
and
she
poured
out
her
confidences
to
susy
over
a
succession
of
dishes
that
manifested
the
s
understanding
of
the
case
ursula
s
confidences
were
always
the
same
though
they
were
usually
about
a
different
person
she
demolished
and
rebuilt
her
sentimental
life
with
the
same
frequency
and
impetuosity
as
that
with
which
she
changed
her
did
over
her
ordered
new
motors
altered
the
mounting
of
her
jewels
and
generally
renewed
the
setting
of
her
life
susy
knew
in
advance
what
the
tale
would
be
but
to
listen
to
it
over
perfect
coffee
an
cigarette
at
her
lips
was
pleasanter
than
consuming
cold
mutton
alone
in
a
mouldy
the
contrast
was
so
soothing
that
she
even
began
to
take
a
languid
interest
in
her
friend
s
narrative
after
luncheon
they
got
into
the
motor
together
and
began
a
systematic
round
of
the
west
end
shops
furriers
jewellers
and
dealers
in
old
furniture
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
violet
melrose
s
long
hesitating
sessions
before
the
things
she
thought
she
wanted
till
the
moment
came
to
decide
ursula
pounced
on
silver
foxes
and
old
lacquer
as
promptly
and
decisively
as
on
the
objects
of
her
surplus
sentimentality
she
knew
at
once
what
she
wanted
and
valued
it
more
after
it
was
hers
and
now
i
wonder
if
you
couldn
t
help
me
choose
a
grand
piano
she
suggested
as
the
last
antiquarian
bowed
them
out
a
piano
yes
for
ruan
i
m
sending
one
down
for
grace
fulmer
she
s
coming
to
stay
did
i
tell
you
i
want
people
to
hear
her
i
want
her
to
get
engagements
in
london
my
dear
she
s
a
a
genius
grace
susy
gasped
i
thought
it
was
nat
nat
nat
fulmer
ursula
laughed
derisively
ah
of
course
you
ve
been
staying
with
that
silly
violet
the
poor
thing
is
off
her
head
about
nat
it
s
really
pitiful
of
course
he
has
talent
i
saw
that
long
before
violet
had
ever
heard
of
him
why
on
the
opening
day
of
the
american
artists
exhibition
last
winter
i
stopped
short
before
his
spring
which
nobody
else
had
noticed
till
that
moment
and
said
to
the
prince
who
was
with
me
the
man
has
but
genius
why
it
s
his
wife
who
has
genius
have
you
never
heard
grace
play
the
violin
poor
violet
as
usual
is
off
on
the
wrong
tack
i
ve
given
fulmer
my
to
do
no
doubt
violet
told
you
because
i
wanted
to
help
him
but
grace
is
my
discovery
and
i
m
determined
to
make
her
known
and
to
have
every
one
understand
that
she
is
the
genius
of
the
two
i
ve
told
her
she
simply
must
come
to
ruan
and
bring
the
best
accompanyist
she
can
find
you
know
poor
nerone
is
dreadfully
bored
by
sport
though
of
course
he
goes
out
with
the
guns
and
if
one
didn
t
have
a
little
art
in
the
evening
oh
susy
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
don
t
know
how
to
choose
a
piano
i
thought
you
were
so
fond
of
music
i
am
fond
of
it
but
without
knowing
anything
about
it
in
the
way
we
re
all
of
us
fond
of
the
worthwhile
things
in
our
stupid
set
she
added
to
herself
since
it
was
obviously
useless
to
impart
such
reflections
to
ursula
but
are
you
sure
grace
is
coming
she
questioned
aloud
quite
sure
why
shouldn
t
she
i
wired
to
her
yesterday
i
m
giving
her
a
thousand
dollars
and
all
her
it
was
not
till
they
were
having
tea
in
a
piccadilly
that
gillow
began
to
manifest
some
interest
in
her
companion
s
plans
the
thought
of
losing
susy
became
suddenly
intolerable
to
her
the
prince
who
did
not
see
why
he
should
be
expected
to
linger
in
london
out
of
season
was
already
at
ruan
and
ursula
could
not
face
the
evening
and
the
whole
of
the
next
day
by
herself
but
what
are
you
doing
in
town
darling
i
don
t
remember
if
i
ve
asked
you
she
said
resting
her
firm
elbows
on
the
while
she
took
a
light
from
susy
s
cigarette
susy
hesitated
she
had
foreseen
that
the
time
must
soon
come
when
she
should
have
to
give
some
account
of
herself
and
why
should
she
not
begin
by
telling
ursula
but
telling
her
what
her
silence
appeared
to
strike
gillow
as
a
reproach
and
she
continued
with
compunction
and
nick
nick
s
with
you
how
is
he
i
thought
you
and
he
still
were
in
venice
with
ellie
we
were
for
a
few
she
steadied
her
voice
it
was
delightful
but
now
we
re
both
on
our
own
again
for
a
gillow
scrutinized
her
more
searchingly
oh
you
re
alone
here
then
quite
alone
yes
nick
s
cruising
with
some
friends
in
the
ursula
s
shallow
gaze
deepened
singularly
but
susy
darling
then
if
you
re
alone
and
out
of
a
job
just
for
the
moment
susy
smiled
well
i
m
not
oh
but
if
you
are
darling
and
you
would
come
to
ruan
i
know
fred
asked
you
didn
t
he
and
he
told
me
that
both
you
and
nick
had
refused
he
was
awfully
huffed
at
your
not
coming
but
i
suppose
that
was
because
nick
had
other
plans
we
couldn
t
have
him
now
because
there
s
no
room
for
another
gun
but
since
he
s
not
here
and
you
re
free
why
you
know
dearest
don
t
you
how
we
d
love
to
have
you
fred
would
be
too
glad
too
outrageously
glad
but
you
don
t
much
mind
fred
s
do
you
and
you
d
be
such
a
help
to
me
if
that
s
any
argument
with
that
big
house
full
of
men
and
people
flocking
over
every
night
to
dine
and
fred
caring
only
for
sport
and
nerone
simply
loathing
it
and
ridiculing
it
and
not
a
minute
to
myself
to
try
to
keep
him
in
a
good
humour
oh
susy
darling
don
t
say
no
but
let
me
telephone
at
once
for
a
place
in
the
train
night
susy
leaned
back
letting
the
ash
lengthen
on
her
cigarette
how
familiar
how
hatefully
familiar
was
that
old
appeal
ursula
felt
the
pressing
need
of
someone
to
flirt
with
fred
for
a
few
weeks
and
here
was
the
very
person
she
needed
susy
shivered
at
the
thought
she
had
never
really
meant
to
go
to
ruan
she
had
simply
used
the
moor
as
a
pretext
when
violet
melrose
had
gently
put
her
out
of
doors
rather
than
do
what
ursula
asked
she
would
borrow
a
few
hundred
pounds
of
strefford
as
he
had
suggested
and
then
look
about
for
some
temporary
occupation
until
until
she
became
lady
altringham
well
perhaps
at
any
rate
she
was
not
going
back
to
slave
for
ursula
she
shook
her
head
with
a
faint
smile
i
m
so
sorry
ursula
of
course
i
want
awfully
to
oblige
you
gillow
s
gaze
grew
reproachful
i
should
have
supposed
you
would
she
murmured
susy
meeting
her
eyes
looked
into
them
down
a
long
vista
of
favours
bestowed
and
perceived
that
ursula
was
not
the
woman
to
forget
on
which
side
the
obligation
lay
between
them
susy
hesitated
she
remembered
the
weeks
of
ecstasy
she
had
owed
to
the
gillows
wedding
cheque
and
it
hurt
her
to
appear
ungrateful
if
i
could
ursula
but
really
i
m
not
free
at
the
she
paused
and
then
took
an
abrupt
decision
the
fact
is
i
m
waiting
here
to
see
strefford
lord
altringham
ursula
stared
ah
yes
mdash
i
remember
you
and
he
used
to
be
great
friends
didn
t
you
her
roving
attention
deepened
but
if
susy
were
waiting
to
see
lord
altringham
one
of
the
richest
men
in
england
suddenly
ursula
opened
her
bag
and
snatched
a
miniature
diary
from
it
but
wait
a
moment
yes
it
is
next
week
i
knew
it
was
next
week
he
s
coming
to
ruan
but
you
darling
that
makes
everything
all
right
you
ll
send
him
a
wire
at
once
and
come
with
me
and
meet
him
there
instead
of
in
this
nasty
sloppy
desert
oh
susy
if
you
knew
how
hard
life
is
for
me
in
scotland
between
the
prince
and
fred
you
couldn
t
possibly
say
no
susy
still
wavered
but
after
all
if
strefford
were
really
bound
for
ruan
why
not
see
him
there
agreeably
and
at
leisure
instead
of
spending
a
dreary
day
with
him
in
roaming
the
wet
london
streets
or
screaming
at
him
through
the
rattle
of
a
restaurant
orchestra
she
knew
he
would
not
be
likely
to
postpone
his
visit
to
ruan
in
order
to
linger
in
london
with
her
such
concessions
had
never
been
his
way
and
were
less
than
ever
likely
to
be
now
that
he
could
do
so
thoroughly
and
completely
as
he
pleased
for
the
first
time
she
fully
understood
how
different
his
destiny
had
become
now
of
course
all
his
days
and
hours
were
mapped
out
in
advance
invitations
assailed
him
opportunities
pressed
on
him
he
had
only
to
choose
and
the
women
she
had
never
before
thought
of
the
women
all
the
girls
in
england
would
be
wanting
to
marry
him
not
to
mention
her
own
enterprising
compatriots
and
there
were
the
married
women
who
were
even
more
to
be
feared
streff
might
for
the
time
escape
marriage
though
she
could
guess
the
power
of
persuasion
family
pressure
all
the
converging
traditional
influences
he
had
so
often
ridiculed
yet
as
she
knew
had
never
completely
thrown
off
yes
those
quiet
invisible
women
at
altringham
his
uncle
s
widow
his
mother
the
spinster
sisters
it
was
not
impossible
that
with
tact
and
patience
and
the
stupidest
women
could
be
tactful
and
patient
on
such
occasions
they
might
eventually
persuade
him
that
it
was
his
duty
they
might
put
just
the
right
young
loveliness
in
his
way
but
meanwhile
now
at
once
there
were
the
married
women
ah
they
wouldn
t
wait
they
were
doubtless
laying
their
traps
already
susy
shivered
at
the
thought
she
knew
too
much
about
the
way
the
trick
was
done
had
followed
too
often
all
the
sinuosities
of
such
approaches
not
that
they
were
very
sinuous
nowadays
more
often
there
was
just
a
swoop
and
a
pounce
when
the
time
came
but
she
knew
all
the
arts
and
the
wiles
that
led
up
to
it
she
knew
them
oh
how
she
knew
them
though
with
streff
thank
heaven
she
had
never
been
called
upon
to
exercise
them
his
love
was
there
for
the
asking
would
she
not
be
a
fool
to
refuse
it
perhaps
though
on
that
point
her
mind
still
wavered
but
at
any
rate
she
saw
that
decidedly
it
would
be
better
to
yield
to
ursula
s
pressure
better
to
meet
him
at
ruan
in
a
congenial
setting
where
she
would
have
time
to
get
her
bearings
observe
what
dangers
threatened
him
and
make
up
her
mind
whether
after
all
it
was
to
be
her
mission
to
save
him
from
the
other
women
well
if
you
like
then
ursula
oh
you
angel
you
i
m
so
glad
we
ll
go
to
the
nearest
post
office
and
send
off
the
wire
as
they
got
into
the
motor
gillow
seized
susy
s
arm
with
a
pleading
pressure
and
you
will
let
fred
make
love
to
you
a
little
won
t
you
darling
xviii
but
i
can
t
think
said
ellie
vanderlyn
earnestly
why
you
don
t
announce
your
engagement
before
waiting
for
your
divorce
people
are
beginning
to
do
it
i
assure
you
it
s
so
much
safer
vanderlyn
on
the
way
back
from
moritz
to
england
had
paused
in
paris
to
renew
the
depleted
wardrobe
which
only
two
months
earlier
had
filled
so
many
trunks
to
bursting
other
ladies
flocking
there
from
all
points
of
the
globe
for
the
same
purpose
disputed
with
her
the
louis
xvi
suites
of
the
nouveau
luxe
the
tables
in
the
restaurant
the
hours
for
at
the
dressmakers
and
just
because
they
were
so
many
and
all
feverishly
fighting
to
get
the
same
things
at
the
same
time
they
were
all
excited
happy
and
at
ease
it
was
the
most
momentous
period
of
the
year
the
height
of
the
dress
makers
vanderlyn
had
run
across
susy
lansing
at
one
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
openings
where
rows
of
ladies
wan
with
heat
and
emotion
sat
for
hours
in
rapt
attention
while
spectral
apparitions
in
incredible
raiment
tottered
endlessly
past
them
on
aching
feet
distracted
from
the
regal
splendours
of
a
chinchilla
cloak
by
the
sense
that
another
lady
was
also
examining
it
vanderlyn
turned
in
surprise
at
sight
of
susy
whose
head
was
critically
bent
above
the
fur
susy
i
d
no
idea
you
were
here
i
saw
in
the
papers
that
you
were
with
the
the
customary
embraces
followed
then
vanderlyn
her
eyes
pursuing
the
matchless
cloak
as
it
disappeared
down
a
vista
of
receding
mannequins
interrogated
sharply
are
you
shopping
for
ursula
if
you
mean
to
order
that
cloak
for
her
i
d
rather
susy
smiled
and
paused
a
moment
before
answering
during
the
pause
she
took
in
all
the
exquisite
details
of
ellie
vanderlyn
s
perpetually
youthful
person
from
the
plumed
crown
of
her
head
to
the
perfect
arch
of
her
shoes
at
last
she
said
quietly
no
i
m
shopping
for
yourself
yourself
vanderlyn
echoed
with
a
stare
of
incredulity
yes
just
for
a
change
susy
serenely
acknowledged
but
the
cloak
i
meant
the
chinchilla
cloak
the
one
with
the
ermine
lining
yes
it
is
awfully
good
isn
t
it
but
i
mean
to
look
elsewhere
before
i
ah
how
often
she
had
heard
her
friends
use
that
phrase
and
how
amusing
it
was
now
to
see
ellie
s
amazement
as
she
heard
it
tossed
off
in
her
own
tone
of
contemptuous
satiety
susy
was
becoming
more
and
more
dependent
on
such
diversions
without
them
her
days
crowded
as
they
were
would
nevertheless
have
dragged
by
heavily
but
it
still
amused
her
to
go
to
the
big
dressmakers
watch
the
mannequins
sweep
by
and
be
seen
by
her
friends
superciliously
examining
all
the
most
expensive
dresses
in
the
procession
she
knew
the
rumour
was
abroad
that
she
and
nick
were
to
be
divorced
and
that
lord
altringham
was
devoted
to
her
she
neither
confirmed
nor
denied
the
report
she
just
let
herself
be
luxuriously
carried
forward
on
its
easy
tide
but
although
it
was
now
three
months
since
nick
had
left
the
palazzo
vanderlyn
she
had
not
yet
written
to
him
nor
he
to
her
meanwhile
in
spite
of
all
that
she
packed
into
them
the
days
passed
more
and
more
slowly
and
the
excitements
she
had
counted
on
no
longer
excited
her
strefford
was
hers
she
knew
that
he
would
marry
her
as
soon
as
she
was
free
they
had
been
together
at
ruan
for
ten
days
and
after
that
she
had
motored
south
with
him
stopping
on
the
way
to
see
altringham
from
which
at
the
moment
his
mourning
relatives
were
absent
at
altringham
they
had
parted
and
after
one
or
two
more
visits
in
england
she
had
come
back
to
paris
where
he
was
now
about
to
join
her
after
her
few
hours
at
altringham
she
had
understood
that
he
would
wait
for
her
as
long
as
was
necessary
the
fear
of
the
other
women
had
ceased
to
trouble
her
but
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
the
future
seemed
less
exciting
than
she
had
expected
sometimes
she
thought
it
was
the
sight
of
that
great
house
which
had
overwhelmed
her
it
was
too
vast
too
venerable
too
like
a
huge
monument
built
of
ancient
territorial
traditions
and
obligations
perhaps
it
had
been
lived
in
for
too
long
by
too
many
and
conscientious
women
somehow
she
could
not
picture
it
invaded
by
bridge
and
debts
and
adultery
and
yet
that
was
what
would
have
to
be
of
course
she
could
hardly
picture
either
strefford
or
herself
continuing
there
the
life
of
heavy
county
responsibilities
dull
parties
laborious
duties
weekly
and
presiding
over
local
committees
what
a
pity
they
couldn
t
sell
it
and
have
a
little
house
on
the
thames
nevertheless
she
was
not
sorry
to
let
it
be
known
that
altringham
was
hers
when
she
chose
to
take
it
at
times
she
wondered
whether
nick
knew
whether
rumours
had
reached
him
if
they
had
he
had
only
his
own
letter
to
thank
for
it
he
had
told
her
what
course
to
pursue
and
she
was
pursuing
it
for
a
moment
the
meeting
with
ellie
vanderlyn
had
been
a
shock
to
her
she
had
hoped
never
to
see
ellie
again
but
now
that
they
were
actually
face
to
face
susy
perceived
how
dulled
her
sensibilities
were
in
a
few
moments
she
had
grown
used
to
ellie
as
she
was
growing
used
to
everybody
and
to
everything
in
the
old
life
she
had
returned
to
what
was
the
use
of
making
such
a
fuss
about
things
she
and
vanderlyn
left
the
s
together
and
after
an
absorbing
session
at
a
new
milliner
s
were
now
taking
tea
in
ellie
s
at
the
nouveau
luxe
ellie
with
her
spoiled
child
s
persistency
had
come
back
to
the
question
of
the
chinchilla
cloak
it
was
the
only
one
she
had
seen
that
she
fancied
in
the
very
least
and
as
she
hadn
t
a
decent
fur
garment
left
to
her
name
she
was
naturally
in
somewhat
of
a
hurry
but
of
course
if
susy
had
been
choosing
that
model
for
a
friend
susy
leaning
back
against
her
cushions
examined
through
lids
vanderlyn
s
small
countenance
which
wore
the
same
expression
of
childish
eagerness
as
when
she
discoursed
of
the
young
davenant
of
the
moment
once
again
susy
remarked
that
in
ellie
s
agitated
existence
every
interest
appeared
to
be
on
exactly
the
same
plane
the
poor
shivering
dear
she
answered
laughing
of
course
it
shall
have
its
nice
warm
winter
cloak
and
i
ll
choose
another
one
oh
you
darling
you
if
you
would
of
course
whoever
you
were
ordering
it
for
need
never
know
ah
you
can
t
comfort
yourself
with
that
i
m
afraid
i
ve
already
told
you
that
i
was
ordering
it
for
susy
paused
to
savour
to
the
full
ellie
s
look
of
blank
bewilderment
then
her
amusement
was
checked
by
an
indefinable
change
in
her
friend
s
expression
oh
dearest
seriously
i
didn
t
know
there
was
someone
susy
flushed
to
the
forehead
a
horror
of
humiliation
overwhelmed
her
that
ellie
should
dare
to
think
that
of
her
that
anyone
should
dare
to
someone
buying
chinchilla
cloaks
for
me
thanks
she
flared
out
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
glad
that
the
idea
didn
t
immediately
occur
to
you
at
least
there
was
a
decent
interval
of
doubt
she
stood
up
laughing
again
and
began
to
wander
about
the
room
in
the
mirror
above
the
mantel
she
caught
sight
of
her
flushed
angry
face
and
of
vanderlyn
s
disconcerted
stare
she
turned
toward
her
friend
i
suppose
everybody
else
will
think
it
if
you
do
so
perhaps
i
d
better
she
paused
and
drew
a
quick
breath
nick
and
i
mean
to
part
have
parted
in
fact
he
s
decided
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
mistake
he
will
probably
marry
again
soon
and
so
shall
she
flung
the
avowal
out
breathlessly
in
her
nervous
dread
of
letting
ellie
vanderlyn
think
for
an
instant
longer
that
any
other
explanation
was
conceivable
she
had
not
meant
to
be
so
explicit
but
once
the
words
were
spoken
she
was
not
altogether
sorry
of
course
people
would
soon
begin
to
wonder
why
she
was
again
straying
about
the
world
alone
and
since
it
was
by
nick
s
choice
why
should
she
not
say
so
remembering
the
burning
anguish
of
those
last
hours
in
venice
she
asked
herself
what
possible
consideration
she
owed
to
the
man
who
had
so
humbled
her
ellie
vanderlyn
glanced
at
her
in
astonishment
you
you
and
nick
are
going
to
part
a
light
appeared
to
dawn
on
her
ah
then
that
s
why
he
sent
me
back
my
pin
i
suppose
your
pin
susy
wondered
not
at
once
remembering
the
poor
little
i
gave
him
before
i
left
venice
he
sent
it
back
almost
at
once
with
the
oddest
note
just
i
haven
t
earned
it
i
couldn
t
think
why
he
didn
t
care
for
the
pin
but
now
i
suppose
it
was
because
you
and
he
had
quarrelled
though
really
even
so
i
can
t
see
why
he
should
bear
me
a
grudge
susy
s
quick
blood
surged
up
nick
had
sent
back
the
pin
the
fatal
pin
and
she
susy
had
kept
the
bracelet
locked
it
up
out
of
sight
shrunk
away
from
the
little
packet
whenever
her
hand
touched
it
in
packing
or
unpacking
but
never
thought
of
returning
it
no
not
once
which
of
the
two
she
wondered
had
been
right
was
it
not
an
indirect
slight
to
her
that
nick
should
fling
back
the
gift
to
poor
uncomprehending
ellie
or
was
it
not
rather
another
proof
of
his
finer
moral
sensitiveness
and
how
could
one
tell
in
their
bewildering
world
it
was
not
because
we
ve
quarrelled
we
haven
t
quarrelled
she
said
slowly
moved
by
the
sudden
desire
to
defend
her
privacy
and
nick
s
to
screen
from
every
eye
their
last
bitter
hour
together
we
ve
simply
decided
that
our
experiment
was
impossible
for
two
ah
well
of
course
we
all
felt
that
at
the
time
and
now
somebody
else
wants
to
marry
you
and
it
s
your
trousseau
you
were
choosing
that
cloak
for
ellie
cried
in
incredulous
rapture
then
she
flung
her
arms
about
susy
s
shrinking
shoulders
you
lucky
lucky
girl
you
clever
clever
darling
but
who
on
earth
can
he
be
and
it
was
then
that
susy
for
the
first
time
had
pronounced
the
name
of
lord
altringham
streff
streff
our
dear
old
streff
you
mean
to
say
he
wants
to
marry
you
as
the
news
took
possession
of
her
mind
ellie
became
dithyrambic
but
my
dearest
what
a
miracle
of
luck
of
course
i
always
knew
he
was
awfully
gone
on
you
fred
davenant
used
to
say
so
i
remember
and
even
nelson
who
s
so
stupid
about
such
things
noticed
it
in
venice
but
then
it
was
so
different
no
one
could
possibly
have
thought
of
marrying
him
then
whereas
now
of
course
every
woman
is
trying
for
him
oh
susy
whatever
you
do
don
t
miss
your
chance
you
can
t
conceive
of
the
wicked
plotting
and
intriguing
there
will
be
to
get
him
on
all
sides
and
even
where
one
least
suspects
it
you
don
t
know
what
horrors
women
will
do
and
even
girls
a
shudder
ran
through
her
at
the
thought
and
she
caught
susy
s
wrists
in
vehement
fingers
but
i
can
t
think
my
dear
why
you
don
t
announce
your
engagement
at
once
people
are
beginning
to
do
it
i
assure
you
it
s
so
much
safer
susy
looked
at
her
wondering
not
a
word
of
sympathy
for
the
ruin
of
her
brief
bliss
not
even
a
gleam
of
curiosity
as
to
its
cause
no
doubt
ellie
vanderlyn
like
all
susy
s
other
friends
had
long
since
discounted
the
brevity
of
her
dream
and
perhaps
planned
a
sequel
to
it
before
she
herself
had
seen
the
glory
fading
she
and
nick
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
their
few
weeks
together
under
ellie
vanderlyn
s
roof
but
to
ellie
obviously
the
fact
meant
no
more
than
her
own
escapade
at
the
same
moment
with
young
davenant
s
supplanter
the
bounder
whom
strefford
had
never
named
her
one
thought
for
her
friend
was
that
susy
should
at
last
secure
her
prize
her
incredible
prize
and
therein
at
any
rate
ellie
showed
the
kind
of
cold
disinterestedness
that
raised
her
above
the
smiling
perfidy
of
the
majority
of
her
kind
at
least
her
advice
was
sincere
and
perhaps
it
was
wise
why
should
susy
not
let
every
one
know
that
she
meant
to
marry
strefford
as
soon
as
the
formalities
were
fulfilled
she
did
not
immediately
answer
vanderlyn
s
question
and
the
latter
repeating
it
added
impatiently
i
don
t
understand
you
if
nick
agrees
oh
he
agrees
said
susy
then
what
more
do
you
want
oh
susy
if
you
d
only
follow
my
example
your
example
susy
paused
weighed
the
word
was
struck
by
something
embarrassed
arch
yet
in
her
friend
s
expression
your
example
she
repeated
why
ellie
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
not
that
you
re
going
to
part
from
poor
nelson
vanderlyn
met
her
reproachful
gaze
with
a
crystalline
glance
i
don
t
want
to
heaven
knows
poor
dear
nelson
i
assure
you
i
simply
hate
it
he
s
always
such
an
angel
to
clarissa
and
then
we
re
used
to
each
other
but
what
in
the
world
am
i
to
do
algie
s
so
rich
so
appallingly
rich
that
i
have
to
be
perpetually
on
the
watch
to
keep
other
women
away
from
him
and
it
s
too
exhausting
algie
vanderlyn
s
lovely
eyebrows
rose
algie
algie
bockheimer
didn
t
you
know
i
think
he
said
you
ve
dined
with
his
parents
nobody
else
in
the
world
is
as
rich
as
the
bockheimers
and
algie
s
their
only
child
yes
it
was
with
him
with
him
i
was
so
dreadfully
happy
last
spring
and
now
i
m
in
mortal
terror
of
losing
him
and
i
do
assure
you
there
s
no
other
way
of
keeping
them
when
they
re
as
hideously
rich
as
that
susy
rose
to
her
feet
a
little
shudder
ran
over
her
she
remembered
now
having
seen
algie
bockheimer
at
one
of
his
parents
first
entertainments
in
their
marble
halls
in
fifth
avenue
she
recalled
his
too
faultless
clothes
and
his
small
glossy
furtive
countenance
she
looked
at
ellie
vanderlyn
with
sudden
scorn
i
think
you
re
abominable
she
exclaimed
the
other
s
perfect
little
face
collapsed
susy
yes
with
nelson
and
clarissa
and
your
past
together
and
all
the
money
you
can
possibly
want
and
that
man
ellie
stood
up
trembling
she
was
not
used
to
scenes
and
they
disarranged
her
thoughts
as
much
as
her
complexion
you
re
very
cruel
susy
so
cruel
and
dreadful
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
answer
you
she
stammered
but
you
simply
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
about
as
if
anybody
ever
had
all
the
money
they
wanted
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
a
cautious
handkerchief
glanced
at
herself
in
the
mirror
and
added
magnanimously
but
i
shall
try
to
forget
what
you
ve
xix
just
such
a
revolt
as
she
had
felt
as
a
girl
such
a
disgusted
recoil
from
the
standards
and
ideals
of
everybody
about
her
as
had
flung
her
into
her
mad
marriage
with
nick
now
flamed
in
susy
lansing
s
bosom
how
could
she
ever
go
back
into
that
world
again
how
echo
its
appraisals
of
life
and
bow
down
to
its
judgments
alas
it
was
only
by
marrying
according
to
its
standards
that
she
could
escape
such
subjection
perhaps
the
same
thought
had
actuated
nick
perhaps
he
had
understood
sooner
than
she
that
to
attain
moral
freedom
they
must
both
be
above
material
cares
perhaps
her
talk
with
ellie
vanderlyn
had
left
susy
so
oppressed
and
humiliated
that
she
almost
shrank
from
her
meeting
with
altringham
the
next
day
she
knew
that
he
was
coming
to
paris
for
his
final
answer
he
would
wait
as
long
as
was
necessary
if
only
she
would
consent
to
take
immediate
steps
for
a
divorce
she
was
staying
at
a
modest
hotel
in
the
faubourg
germain
and
had
once
more
refused
his
suggestion
that
they
should
lunch
at
the
nouveau
luxe
or
at
some
fashionable
restaurant
of
the
boulevards
as
before
she
insisted
on
going
to
an
place
near
the
luxembourg
where
the
prices
were
moderate
enough
for
her
own
purse
i
can
t
understand
strefford
objected
as
they
turned
from
her
hotel
door
toward
this
obscure
retreat
why
you
insist
on
giving
me
bad
food
and
depriving
me
of
the
satisfaction
of
being
seen
with
you
why
must
we
be
so
dreadfully
clandestine
don
t
people
know
by
this
time
that
we
re
to
be
married
susy
winced
a
little
she
wondered
if
the
word
would
always
sound
so
unnatural
on
his
lips
no
she
said
with
a
laugh
they
simply
think
for
the
present
that
you
re
giving
me
pearls
and
chinchilla
he
wrinkled
his
brows
well
so
i
would
with
joy
at
this
particular
minute
don
t
you
think
perhaps
you
d
better
take
advantage
of
it
i
don
t
wish
to
insist
but
i
foresee
that
i
m
much
too
rich
not
to
become
she
gave
a
slight
shrug
at
present
there
s
nothing
i
loathe
more
than
pearls
and
chinchilla
or
anything
else
in
the
world
that
s
expensive
and
enviable
suddenly
she
broke
off
colouring
with
the
consciousness
that
she
had
said
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
that
all
the
women
who
were
trying
for
him
except
the
very
cleverest
would
be
sure
to
say
and
that
he
would
certainly
suspect
her
of
attempting
the
conventional
comedy
of
disinterestedness
than
which
nothing
was
less
likely
to
deceive
or
to
flatter
him
his
twinkling
eyes
played
curiously
over
her
face
and
she
went
on
meeting
them
with
a
smile
but
don
t
imagine
all
the
same
that
if
i
should
decide
it
would
be
altogether
for
your
beaux
yeux
he
laughed
she
thought
rather
drily
no
he
said
i
don
t
suppose
that
s
ever
likely
to
happen
to
me
oh
streff
she
faltered
with
compunction
it
was
odd
once
upon
a
time
she
had
known
exactly
what
to
say
to
the
man
of
the
moment
whoever
he
was
and
whatever
kind
of
talk
he
required
she
had
even
in
the
difficult
days
before
her
marriage
reeled
off
glibly
enough
the
sort
of
sentimentality
that
plunged
poor
fred
gillow
into
such
speechless
beatitude
but
since
then
she
had
spoken
the
language
of
real
love
looked
with
its
eyes
embraced
with
its
hands
and
now
the
other
trumpery
art
had
failed
her
and
she
was
conscious
of
bungling
and
groping
like
a
beginner
under
strefford
s
ironic
scrutiny
they
had
reached
their
obscure
destination
and
he
opened
the
door
and
glanced
in
it
s
jammed
not
a
table
and
stifling
where
shall
we
go
perhaps
they
could
give
us
a
room
to
ourselves
he
suggested
she
assented
and
they
were
led
up
a
staircase
to
a
closet
lit
by
the
arched
top
of
a
high
window
the
lower
panes
of
which
served
for
the
floor
below
strefford
opened
the
window
and
susy
throwing
her
cloak
on
the
divan
leaned
on
the
balcony
while
he
ordered
luncheon
on
the
whole
she
was
glad
they
were
to
be
alone
just
because
she
felt
so
sure
of
strefford
it
seemed
ungenerous
to
keep
him
longer
in
suspense
the
moment
had
come
when
they
must
have
a
decisive
talk
and
in
the
crowded
rooms
below
it
would
have
been
impossible
strefford
when
the
waiter
had
brought
the
first
course
and
left
them
to
themselves
made
no
effort
to
revert
to
personal
matters
he
turned
instead
to
the
topic
always
most
congenial
to
him
the
humours
and
ironies
of
the
human
comedy
as
presented
by
his
own
particular
group
his
malicious
commentary
on
life
had
always
amused
susy
because
of
the
shrewd
flashes
of
philosophy
he
shed
on
the
social
antics
they
had
so
often
watched
together
he
was
in
fact
the
one
person
she
knew
excepting
nick
who
was
in
the
show
and
yet
outside
of
it
and
she
was
surprised
as
the
talk
proceeded
to
find
herself
so
little
interested
in
his
scraps
of
gossip
and
so
little
amused
by
his
comments
on
them
with
an
inward
shrug
of
discouragement
she
said
to
herself
that
probably
nothing
would
ever
really
amuse
her
again
then
as
she
listened
she
began
to
understand
that
her
disappointment
arose
from
the
fact
that
strefford
in
reality
could
not
live
without
these
people
whom
he
saw
through
and
satirized
and
that
the
rather
commonplace
scandals
he
narrated
interested
him
as
much
as
his
own
racy
considerations
on
them
and
she
was
filled
with
terror
at
the
thought
that
the
inmost
core
of
the
life
of
the
countess
of
altringham
would
be
just
as
poor
and
a
place
as
the
little
room
in
which
he
and
she
now
sat
elbow
to
elbow
yet
so
unapproachably
apart
if
strefford
could
not
live
without
these
people
neither
could
she
and
nick
but
for
reasons
how
different
and
if
his
opportunities
had
been
theirs
what
a
world
they
would
have
created
for
themselves
such
imaginings
were
vain
and
she
shrank
back
from
them
into
the
present
after
all
as
lady
altringham
she
would
have
the
power
to
create
that
world
which
she
and
nick
had
dreamed
only
she
must
create
it
alone
well
that
was
probably
the
law
of
things
all
human
happiness
was
thus
conditioned
and
circumscribed
and
hers
no
doubt
must
always
be
of
the
lonely
kind
since
material
things
did
not
suffice
for
it
even
though
it
depended
on
them
as
grace
fulmer
s
for
instance
never
had
yet
even
grace
fulmer
had
succumbed
to
ursula
s
offer
and
had
arrived
at
ruan
the
day
before
susy
left
instead
of
going
to
spain
with
her
husband
and
violet
melrose
but
then
grace
was
making
the
sacrifice
for
her
children
and
somehow
one
had
the
feeling
that
in
giving
up
her
liberty
she
was
not
surrendering
a
tittle
of
herself
all
the
difference
was
there
how
i
do
bore
you
susy
heard
strefford
exclaim
she
became
aware
that
she
had
not
been
listening
stray
echoes
of
names
of
places
and
people
violet
melrose
ursula
prince
altineri
others
of
their
group
and
persuasion
had
vainly
knocked
at
her
barricaded
brain
what
had
he
been
telling
her
about
them
she
turned
to
him
and
their
eyes
met
his
were
full
of
a
melancholy
irony
susy
old
girl
what
s
wrong
she
pulled
herself
together
i
was
thinking
streff
just
now
when
i
said
i
hated
the
very
sound
of
pearls
and
chinchilla
how
impossible
it
was
that
you
should
believe
me
in
fact
what
a
blunder
i
d
made
in
saying
he
smiled
because
it
was
what
so
many
other
women
might
be
likely
to
say
so
awfully
unoriginal
in
fact
she
laughed
for
sheer
joy
at
his
insight
it
s
going
to
be
easier
than
i
imagined
she
thought
aloud
she
rejoined
oh
streff
how
you
re
always
going
to
find
me
out
where
on
earth
shall
i
ever
hide
from
you
where
he
echoed
her
laugh
laying
his
hand
lightly
on
hers
in
my
heart
i
m
in
spite
of
the
laugh
his
accent
shook
her
something
about
it
took
all
the
mockery
from
his
retort
checked
on
her
lips
the
what
a
valentine
and
made
her
suddenly
feel
that
if
he
were
afraid
so
was
she
yet
she
was
touched
also
and
wondered
half
exultingly
if
any
other
woman
had
ever
caught
that
particular
deep
inflexion
of
his
shrill
voice
she
had
never
liked
him
as
much
as
at
that
moment
and
she
said
to
herself
with
an
odd
sense
of
detachment
as
if
she
had
been
rather
breathlessly
observing
the
vacillations
of
someone
whom
she
longed
to
persuade
but
dared
not
now
now
if
he
speaks
i
shall
say
yes
he
did
not
speak
but
abruptly
and
as
startlingly
to
her
as
if
she
had
just
dropped
from
a
sphere
whose
inhabitants
had
other
methods
of
expressing
their
sympathy
he
slipped
his
arm
around
her
and
bent
his
keen
ugly
melting
face
to
hers
it
was
the
lightest
touch
in
an
instant
she
was
free
again
but
something
within
her
gasped
and
resisted
long
after
his
arm
and
his
lips
were
gone
and
he
was
proceeding
with
a
ease
to
light
a
cigarette
and
sweeten
his
coffee
he
had
kissed
her
well
naturally
why
not
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
been
kissed
it
was
true
that
one
didn
t
habitually
associate
streff
with
such
demonstrations
but
she
had
not
that
excuse
for
surprise
for
even
in
venice
she
had
begun
to
notice
that
he
looked
at
her
differently
and
avoided
her
hand
when
he
used
to
seek
it
no
she
ought
not
to
have
been
surprised
nor
ought
a
kiss
to
have
been
so
disturbing
such
incidents
had
punctuated
the
career
of
susy
branch
there
had
been
in
particular
in
discarded
times
fred
gillow
s
large
but
artless
embraces
well
nothing
of
that
kind
had
seemed
of
any
more
account
than
the
click
of
a
leaf
in
a
woodland
walk
it
had
all
been
merely
epidermal
ephemeral
part
of
the
trivial
accepted
business
of
the
social
comedy
but
this
kiss
of
strefford
s
was
what
nick
s
had
been
under
the
new
hampshire
pines
on
the
day
that
had
decided
their
fate
it
was
a
kiss
with
a
future
in
it
like
a
ring
slipped
upon
her
soul
and
now
in
the
dreadful
pause
that
followed
while
strefford
fidgeted
with
his
and
rattled
the
spoon
in
his
cup
susy
remembered
what
she
had
seen
through
the
circle
of
nick
s
kiss
that
blue
illimitable
distance
which
was
at
once
the
landscape
at
their
feet
and
the
future
in
their
souls
perhaps
that
was
what
strefford
s
sharply
narrowed
eyes
were
seeing
now
that
same
illimitable
distance
that
she
had
lost
forever
perhaps
he
was
saying
to
himself
as
she
had
said
to
herself
when
her
lips
left
nick
s
each
time
we
kiss
we
shall
see
it
all
again
whereas
all
she
herself
had
felt
was
the
gasping
recoil
from
strefford
s
touch
and
an
intenser
vision
of
the
sordid
room
in
which
he
and
she
sat
and
of
their
two
selves
more
distant
from
each
other
than
if
their
embrace
had
been
a
sudden
thrusting
apart
the
moment
prolonged
itself
and
they
sat
numb
how
long
had
it
lasted
how
long
ago
was
it
that
she
had
thought
it
s
going
to
be
easier
than
i
imagined
suddenly
she
felt
strefford
s
queer
smile
upon
her
and
saw
in
his
eyes
a
look
not
of
reproach
or
disappointment
but
of
deep
and
anxious
comprehension
instead
of
being
angry
or
hurt
he
had
seen
he
had
understood
he
was
sorry
for
her
impulsively
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
and
they
sat
silent
for
another
moment
then
he
stood
up
and
took
her
cloak
from
the
divan
shall
we
go
now
i
ve
got
cards
for
the
private
view
of
the
reynolds
exhibition
at
the
petit
palais
there
are
some
portraits
from
altringham
it
might
amuse
in
the
taxi
she
had
time
through
their
light
rattle
of
talk
to
readjust
herself
and
drop
back
into
her
usual
feeling
of
friendly
ease
with
him
he
had
been
extraordinarily
considerate
for
anyone
who
always
so
undisguisedly
sought
his
own
satisfaction
above
all
things
and
if
his
considerateness
were
just
an
indirect
way
of
seeking
that
satisfaction
now
well
that
proved
how
much
he
cared
for
her
how
necessary
to
his
happiness
she
had
become
the
sense
of
power
was
undeniably
pleasant
pleasanter
still
was
the
feeling
that
someone
really
needed
her
that
the
happiness
of
the
man
at
her
side
depended
on
her
yes
or
no
she
abandoned
herself
to
the
feeling
forgetting
the
abysmal
interval
of
his
caress
or
at
least
saying
to
herself
that
in
time
she
would
forget
it
that
really
there
was
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
in
being
kissed
by
anyone
she
liked
as
much
as
streff
she
had
guessed
at
once
why
he
was
taking
her
to
see
the
reynoldses
fashionable
and
artistic
paris
had
recently
discovered
english
eighteenth
century
art
the
principal
collections
of
england
had
yielded
up
their
best
examples
of
the
great
portrait
painter
s
work
and
the
private
view
at
the
petit
palais
was
to
be
the
social
event
of
the
afternoon
everybody
strefford
s
everybody
and
susy
s
was
sure
to
be
there
and
these
as
she
knew
were
the
occasions
that
revived
strefford
s
intermittent
interest
in
art
he
really
liked
picture
shows
as
much
as
the
races
if
one
could
be
sure
of
seeing
as
many
people
there
with
nick
how
different
it
would
have
been
nick
hated
openings
and
varnishing
days
and
worldly
aesthetics
in
general
he
would
have
waited
till
the
tide
of
fashion
had
ebbed
and
slipped
off
with
susy
to
see
the
pictures
some
morning
when
they
were
sure
to
have
the
place
to
themselves
but
susy
divined
that
there
was
another
reason
for
strefford
s
suggestion
she
had
never
yet
shown
herself
with
him
publicly
among
their
own
group
of
people
now
he
had
determined
that
she
should
do
so
and
she
knew
why
she
had
humbled
his
pride
he
had
understood
and
forgiven
her
but
she
still
continued
to
treat
him
as
she
had
always
treated
the
strefford
of
old
charlie
strefford
dear
old
negligible
impecunious
streff
and
he
wanted
to
show
her
ever
so
casually
and
adroitly
that
the
man
who
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
was
no
longer
strefford
but
lord
altringham
at
the
very
threshold
his
ambassador
s
greeting
marked
the
difference
it
was
followed
wherever
they
turned
by
ejaculations
of
welcome
from
the
rulers
of
the
world
they
moved
in
everybody
rich
enough
or
titled
enough
or
clever
enough
or
stupid
enough
to
have
forced
a
way
into
the
social
citadel
was
there
waving
and
from
the
battlements
and
to
all
of
them
lord
altringham
had
become
a
marked
figure
during
their
slow
progress
through
the
dense
mass
of
important
people
who
made
the
approach
to
the
pictures
so
well
worth
fighting
for
he
never
left
susy
s
side
or
failed
to
make
her
feel
herself
a
part
of
his
triumphal
advance
she
heard
her
name
mentioned
lansing
a
lansing
an
american
susy
lansing
yes
of
course
you
remember
her
at
newport
at
moritz
exactly
divorced
already
they
say
so
susy
darling
i
d
no
idea
you
were
here
and
lord
altringham
you
ve
forgotten
me
i
know
lord
altringham
yes
last
year
in
cairo
or
at
newport
or
in
scotland
susy
dearest
when
will
you
bring
lord
altringham
to
dine
any
night
that
you
and
he
are
free
i
ll
arrange
to
be
you
and
he
they
were
you
and
he
already
ah
there
s
one
of
them
of
my
strefford
explained
giving
a
last
push
that
drew
him
and
susy
to
the
front
rank
before
a
tall
isolated
portrait
which
by
sheer
majesty
of
presentment
sat
in
its
great
carved
golden
frame
as
on
a
throne
above
the
other
pictures
susy
read
on
the
scroll
beneath
it
the
hon
ble
diana
lefanu
fifteenth
countess
of
altringham
and
heard
strefford
say
do
you
remember
it
hangs
where
you
noticed
the
empty
space
above
the
in
the
vandyke
room
they
say
reynolds
stipulated
that
it
should
be
put
with
the
she
had
never
before
heard
him
speak
of
his
possessions
whether
ancestral
or
merely
material
in
just
that
full
and
satisfied
tone
of
voice
the
rich
man
s
voice
she
saw
that
he
was
already
feeling
the
influence
of
his
surroundings
that
he
was
glad
the
portrait
of
a
countess
of
altringham
should
occupy
the
central
place
in
the
principal
room
of
the
exhibition
that
the
crowd
about
it
should
be
denser
there
than
before
any
of
the
other
pictures
and
that
he
should
be
standing
there
with
susy
letting
her
feel
and
letting
all
the
people
about
them
guess
that
the
day
she
chose
she
could
wear
the
same
name
as
his
pictured
ancestress
on
the
way
back
to
her
hotel
strefford
made
no
farther
allusion
to
their
future
they
chatted
like
old
comrades
in
their
respective
corners
of
the
taxi
but
as
the
carriage
stopped
at
her
door
he
said
i
must
go
back
to
england
the
day
after
worse
luck
why
not
dine
with
me
at
the
nouveau
luxe
i
ve
got
to
have
the
ambassador
and
lady
ascot
with
their
youngest
girl
and
my
old
dunes
aunt
the
dowager
duchess
who
s
over
here
hiding
from
her
creditors
but
i
ll
try
to
get
two
or
three
amusing
men
to
leaven
the
lump
we
might
go
on
to
a
boite
afterward
if
you
re
bored
unless
the
dancing
amuses
you
more
she
understood
that
he
had
decided
to
hasten
his
departure
rather
than
linger
on
in
uncertainty
she
also
remembered
having
heard
the
ascots
youngest
daughter
lady
joan
senechal
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
prettiest
girls
of
the
season
and
she
recalled
the
almost
exaggerated
warmth
of
the
ambassador
s
greeting
at
the
private
view
of
course
i
ll
come
streff
dear
she
cried
with
an
effort
at
gaiety
that
sounded
successful
to
her
own
strained
ears
and
reflected
itself
in
the
sudden
lighting
up
of
his
face
she
waved
a
from
the
step
saying
to
herself
as
she
looked
after
him
he
ll
drive
me
home
and
i
shall
say
yes
and
then
he
ll
kiss
me
again
but
the
next
time
it
won
t
be
nearly
as
she
turned
into
the
hotel
glanced
automatically
at
the
empty
for
letters
under
her
and
mounted
the
stairs
following
the
same
train
of
images
yes
i
shall
say
yes
she
repeated
firmly
her
hand
on
the
door
of
her
room
that
is
unless
they
ve
brought
up
a
letter
she
never
the
hotel
without
imagining
that
the
letter
she
had
not
found
below
had
already
been
brought
up
opening
the
door
she
turned
on
the
light
and
sprang
to
the
table
on
which
her
correspondence
sometimes
awaited
her
there
was
no
letter
but
the
morning
papers
still
unread
lay
at
hand
and
glancing
listlessly
down
the
column
which
chronicles
the
doings
of
society
she
read
after
an
extended
cruise
in
the
aegean
and
the
black
sea
on
their
ibis
and
mortimer
hicks
and
their
daughter
are
established
at
the
nouveau
luxe
in
rome
they
have
lately
had
the
honour
of
entertaining
at
dinner
the
reigning
prince
of
and
his
mother
the
princess
dowager
with
their
suite
among
those
invited
to
meet
their
serene
highnesses
were
the
french
and
spanish
ambassadors
the
duchesse
de
vichy
prince
and
princess
bagnidilucca
lady
penelope
pantiles
susy
s
eye
flew
impatiently
on
over
the
long
list
of
titles
and
nicholas
lansing
of
new
york
who
has
been
cruising
with
and
hicks
on
the
ibis
for
the
last
few
xx
the
mortimer
hickses
were
in
rome
not
as
they
would
in
former
times
have
been
in
one
of
the
antiquated
hostelries
of
the
piazza
di
spagna
or
the
porta
del
popolo
where
of
old
they
had
so
gaily
defied
fever
and
nourished
themselves
on
local
colour
but
spread
out
with
all
the
ostentation
of
philistine
millionaires
under
the
piano
nobile
ceilings
of
one
of
the
palaces
where
as
hicks
shamelessly
declared
they
could
rely
on
the
plumbing
and
have
the
privilege
of
the
queen
mother
s
it
was
that
speech
uttered
with
beaming
aplomb
at
a
surrounded
by
the
cosmopolitan
nobility
of
the
eternal
city
that
had
suddenly
revealed
to
lansing
the
profound
change
in
the
hicks
point
of
view
as
he
looked
back
over
the
four
months
since
he
had
so
unexpectedly
joined
the
ibis
at
genoa
he
saw
that
the
change
at
first
insidious
and
unperceived
dated
from
the
day
when
the
hickses
had
run
across
a
reigning
prince
on
his
travels
hitherto
they
had
been
proof
against
such
perils
both
and
hicks
had
often
declared
that
the
aristocracy
of
the
intellect
was
the
only
one
which
attracted
them
but
in
this
case
the
prince
possessed
an
intellect
in
addition
to
his
few
square
miles
of
territory
and
to
one
of
the
most
beautiful
field
marshal
s
uniforms
that
had
ever
encased
a
royal
warrior
the
prince
was
not
a
warrior
however
he
was
stooping
pacific
and
spectacled
and
his
possession
of
the
uniform
had
been
revealed
to
hicks
only
by
the
gift
of
a
photograph
in
a
bond
street
frame
with
anastasius
written
slantingly
across
its
legs
the
prince
and
herein
lay
the
hickses
undoing
the
prince
was
an
archaeologist
an
earnest
anxious
enquiring
and
scrupulous
archaeologist
delicate
health
so
his
suite
hinted
banished
him
for
a
part
of
each
year
from
his
cold
and
foggy
principality
and
in
the
company
of
his
mother
the
active
and
enthusiastic
dowager
princess
he
wandered
from
one
mediterranean
shore
to
another
now
assisting
at
the
exhumation
of
ptolemaic
mummies
now
at
the
excavation
of
delphic
temples
or
of
north
african
basilicas
the
beginning
of
winter
usually
brought
the
prince
and
his
mother
to
rome
or
nice
unless
indeed
they
were
summoned
by
family
duties
to
berlin
vienna
or
madrid
for
an
extended
connection
with
the
principal
royal
houses
of
europe
compelled
them
as
the
princess
mother
said
to
be
always
burying
or
marrying
a
cousin
at
other
moments
they
were
seldom
seen
in
the
glacial
atmosphere
of
courts
preferring
to
royal
palaces
those
of
the
other
and
more
modern
type
in
one
of
which
the
hickses
were
now
lodged
yes
the
prince
and
his
mother
they
gaily
avowed
it
revelled
in
palace
hotels
and
being
unable
to
afford
the
luxury
of
inhabiting
them
they
liked
as
often
as
possible
to
be
invited
to
dine
there
by
their
friends
or
even
to
tea
my
dear
the
princess
laughingly
avowed
for
i
m
so
awfully
fond
of
buttered
scones
and
anastasius
gives
me
so
little
to
eat
in
the
the
encounter
with
these
ambulant
highnesses
had
been
fatal
lansing
now
perceived
it
to
hicks
s
principles
she
had
known
a
great
many
archaeologists
but
never
one
as
agreeable
as
the
prince
and
above
all
never
one
who
had
left
a
throne
to
camp
in
the
desert
and
delve
in
libyan
tombs
and
it
seemed
to
her
infinitely
pathetic
that
these
two
gifted
beings
who
grumbled
when
they
had
to
go
to
marry
a
cousin
at
the
palace
of
james
or
of
madrid
and
hastened
back
breathlessly
to
the
point
where
metaphorically
speaking
and
spade
had
dropped
from
their
royal
hands
that
these
heirs
of
the
ages
should
be
unable
to
offer
themselves
the
comforts
of
hotel
life
and
should
enjoy
themselves
like
babies
when
they
were
invited
to
the
other
kind
of
palace
to
feast
on
buttered
scones
and
watch
the
tango
she
simply
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
their
privations
and
neither
after
a
time
could
hicks
who
found
the
prince
more
democratic
than
anyone
he
had
ever
known
at
apex
city
and
was
immensely
interested
by
the
fact
that
their
spectacles
came
from
the
same
optician
but
it
was
above
all
the
artistic
tendencies
of
the
prince
and
his
mother
which
had
conquered
the
hickses
there
was
fascination
in
the
thought
that
among
the
rabble
of
vulgar
uneducated
royalties
who
overran
europe
from
biarritz
to
the
engadine
gambling
tangoing
and
sponging
on
no
less
vulgar
plebeians
they
the
unobtrusive
and
hickses
should
have
had
the
luck
to
meet
this
cultivated
pair
who
joined
them
in
gentle
ridicule
of
their
own
frivolous
kinsfolk
and
whose
tastes
were
exactly
those
of
the
eccentric
unreliable
and
sometimes
persons
who
had
hitherto
represented
the
higher
life
to
the
hickses
now
at
last
hicks
saw
the
possibility
of
being
at
once
artistic
and
luxurious
of
surrendering
herself
to
the
joys
of
modern
plumbing
and
yet
keeping
the
talk
on
the
highest
level
if
the
poor
dear
princess
wants
to
dine
at
the
nouveau
luxe
why
shouldn
t
we
give
her
that
pleasure
hicks
smilingly
enquired
and
as
for
enjoying
her
buttered
scones
like
a
baby
as
she
says
i
think
it
s
the
sweetest
thing
about
coral
hicks
did
not
join
in
this
chorus
but
she
accepted
with
her
curious
air
of
impartiality
the
change
in
her
parents
manner
of
life
and
for
the
first
time
as
nick
observed
occupied
herself
with
her
mother
s
toilet
with
the
result
that
hicks
s
outline
became
firmer
her
garments
soberer
in
hue
and
finer
in
material
so
that
should
anyone
chance
to
detect
the
daughter
s
likeness
to
her
mother
the
result
was
less
likely
to
be
disturbing
such
precautions
were
the
more
needful
lansing
could
not
but
note
because
of
the
different
standards
of
the
society
in
which
the
hickses
now
moved
for
it
was
a
curious
fact
that
admission
to
the
intimacy
of
the
prince
and
his
mother
who
continually
declared
themselves
to
be
the
pariahs
the
outlaws
the
bohemians
among
crowned
heads
nevertheless
involved
not
only
living
in
palace
hotels
but
mixing
with
those
who
frequented
them
the
prince
s
an
agreeable
young
man
of
easy
manners
had
smilingly
hinted
that
their
serene
highnesses
though
so
thoroughly
democratic
and
unceremonious
were
yet
accustomed
to
inspecting
in
advance
the
names
of
the
persons
whom
their
hosts
wished
to
invite
with
them
and
lansing
noticed
that
hicks
s
lists
having
been
submitted
usually
came
back
lengthened
by
the
addition
of
numerous
wealthy
and
titled
guests
their
highnesses
never
struck
out
a
name
they
welcomed
with
enthusiasm
and
curiosity
the
hickses
oddest
and
most
inexplicable
friends
at
most
putting
off
some
of
them
to
a
later
day
on
the
plea
that
it
would
be
cosier
to
meet
them
on
a
more
private
occasion
but
they
invariably
added
to
the
list
any
friends
of
their
own
with
the
gracious
hint
that
they
wished
these
latter
though
socially
so
for
to
have
the
immense
privilege
of
knowing
the
hickses
and
thus
it
happened
that
when
october
gales
necessitated
laying
up
the
ibis
the
hickses
finding
again
in
rome
the
august
travellers
from
whom
they
had
parted
the
previous
month
in
athens
also
found
their
enlarged
by
all
that
the
capital
contained
of
fashion
it
was
true
enough
as
lansing
had
not
failed
to
note
that
the
princess
mother
adored
prehistoric
art
and
russian
music
and
the
paintings
of
gauguin
and
matisse
but
she
also
and
with
a
beaming
unconsciousness
of
perspective
adored
large
pearls
and
powerful
motors
caravan
tea
and
modern
plumbing
perfumed
cigarettes
and
society
scandals
and
her
son
while
apparently
less
sensible
to
these
forms
of
luxury
adored
his
mother
and
was
charmed
to
gratify
her
inclinations
without
cost
to
himself
since
poor
mamma
as
he
observed
is
so
courageous
when
we
are
roughing
it
in
the
the
smiling
who
explained
these
things
to
lansing
added
with
an
intenser
smile
that
the
prince
and
his
mother
were
under
obligations
either
social
or
cousinly
to
most
of
the
titled
persons
whom
they
begged
hicks
to
invite
and
it
seems
to
their
serene
highnesses
he
added
the
most
flattering
return
they
can
make
for
the
hospitality
of
their
friends
to
give
them
such
an
intellectual
the
at
which
their
highnesses
friends
were
seated
on
the
evening
in
question
represented
numerically
one
of
the
greatest
intellectual
opportunities
yet
afforded
them
thirty
guests
were
grouped
about
the
board
from
which
eldorada
and
beck
had
been
excluded
on
the
plea
that
the
princess
mother
liked
cosy
parties
and
begged
her
hosts
that
there
should
never
be
more
than
thirty
at
table
such
at
least
was
the
reason
given
by
hicks
to
her
faithful
followers
but
lansing
had
observed
that
of
late
the
same
skilled
hand
which
had
refashioned
the
hickses
social
circle
usually
managed
to
exclude
from
it
the
timid
presences
of
the
two
secretaries
their
banishment
was
the
more
displeasing
to
lansing
from
the
fact
that
for
the
last
three
months
he
had
filled
buttles
s
place
and
was
himself
their
salaried
companion
but
since
he
had
accepted
the
post
his
obvious
duty
was
to
fill
it
in
accordance
with
his
employers
requirements
and
it
was
clear
even
to
eldorada
and
beck
that
he
had
as
eldorada
ungrudgingly
said
something
of
buttles
s
marvellous
social
during
the
cruise
his
task
had
not
been
distasteful
to
him
he
was
glad
of
any
definite
duties
however
trivial
he
felt
more
independent
as
the
hickses
secretary
than
as
their
pampered
guest
and
the
large
cheque
which
hicks
handed
over
to
him
on
the
first
of
each
month
refreshed
his
languishing
sense
of
he
considered
himself
absurdly
but
that
was
the
hickses
affair
and
he
saw
nothing
humiliating
in
being
in
the
employ
of
people
he
liked
and
respected
but
from
the
moment
of
the
encounter
with
the
wandering
princes
his
position
had
changed
as
much
as
that
of
his
employers
he
was
no
longer
to
and
hicks
a
useful
and
estimable
assistant
on
the
same
level
as
eldorada
and
beck
he
had
become
a
social
asset
of
unsuspected
value
equalling
buttles
in
his
capacity
for
dealing
with
the
mysteries
of
foreign
etiquette
and
surpassing
him
in
the
art
of
personal
attraction
nick
lansing
the
hickses
found
already
knew
most
of
the
princess
mother
s
rich
and
aristocratic
friends
many
of
them
hailed
him
with
enthusiastic
old
nicks
and
he
was
almost
as
familiar
as
his
highness
s
own
with
all
those
secret
ramifications
of
love
and
hate
that
made
so
much
more
of
a
science
in
rome
than
at
apex
city
hicks
at
first
had
hopelessly
lost
her
way
in
this
labyrinth
of
subterranean
scandals
rivalries
and
jealousies
and
finding
lansing
s
hand
within
reach
she
clung
to
it
with
pathetic
tenacity
but
if
the
young
man
s
value
had
risen
in
the
eyes
of
his
employers
it
had
deteriorated
in
his
own
he
was
condemned
to
play
a
part
he
had
not
bargained
for
and
it
seemed
to
him
more
degrading
when
paid
in
than
if
his
retribution
had
consisted
merely
in
good
dinners
and
luxurious
lodgings
the
first
time
the
smiling
had
caught
his
eye
over
a
verbal
slip
of
hicks
s
nick
had
flushed
to
the
forehead
and
gone
to
bed
swearing
that
he
would
chuck
his
job
the
next
day
two
months
had
passed
since
then
and
he
was
still
the
paid
secretary
he
had
contrived
to
let
the
feel
that
he
was
too
deficient
in
humour
to
be
worth
exchanging
glances
with
but
even
this
had
not
restored
his
and
on
the
evening
in
question
as
he
looked
about
the
long
table
he
said
to
himself
for
the
hundredth
time
that
he
would
give
up
his
position
on
the
morrow
only
what
was
the
alternative
the
alternative
apparently
was
coral
hicks
he
glanced
down
the
line
of
diners
beginning
with
the
tall
lean
countenance
of
the
princess
mother
with
its
small
inquisitive
eyes
perched
as
high
as
attic
windows
under
a
frizzled
thatch
of
hair
and
a
pediment
of
uncleaned
diamonds
passed
on
to
the
vacuous
and
overfed
or
fashionably
haggard
masks
of
the
ladies
next
in
rank
and
finally
caught
between
branching
orchids
a
distant
glimpse
of
miss
hicks
in
contrast
with
the
others
he
thought
she
looked
surprisingly
noble
her
large
grave
features
made
her
appear
like
an
old
monument
in
a
street
of
palace
hotels
and
he
marvelled
at
the
mysterious
law
which
had
brought
this
archaic
face
out
of
apex
city
and
given
to
the
oldest
society
of
europe
a
look
of
such
mixed
modernity
lansing
perceived
that
the
who
was
his
neighbour
was
also
looking
at
miss
hicks
his
expression
was
serious
and
even
thoughtful
but
as
his
eyes
met
lansing
s
he
readjusted
his
official
smile
i
was
admiring
our
hostess
s
daughter
her
absence
of
jewels
is
er
an
inspiration
he
remarked
in
the
confidential
tone
which
lansing
had
come
to
dread
oh
miss
hicks
is
full
of
inspirations
he
returned
curtly
and
the
bowed
with
an
admiring
air
as
if
inspirations
were
rarer
than
pearls
as
in
his
milieu
they
undoubtedly
were
she
is
the
equal
of
any
situation
i
am
sure
he
replied
and
then
abandoned
the
subject
with
one
of
his
automatic
transitions
after
dinner
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
he
surprised
nick
by
returning
to
the
same
topic
and
this
time
without
thinking
it
needful
to
readjust
his
smile
his
face
remained
serious
though
his
manner
was
studiously
informal
i
was
admiring
at
dinner
miss
hicks
s
invariable
sense
of
appropriateness
it
must
permit
her
friends
to
foresee
for
her
almost
any
future
however
lansing
hesitated
and
controlled
his
annoyance
decidedly
he
wanted
to
know
what
was
in
his
companion
s
mind
what
do
you
mean
by
exalted
he
asked
with
a
smile
of
faint
amusement
well
equal
to
her
marvellous
capacity
for
shining
in
the
public
lansing
still
smiled
the
question
is
i
suppose
whether
her
desire
to
shine
equals
her
the
stared
you
mean
she
s
not
ambitious
on
the
contrary
i
believe
her
to
be
immeasurably
immeasurably
the
seemed
to
try
to
measure
it
but
not
surely
beyond
beyond
what
we
can
offer
his
eyes
completed
the
sentence
and
it
was
lansing
s
turn
to
stare
the
faced
the
stare
yes
his
eyes
concluded
in
a
flash
while
his
lips
let
fall
the
princess
mother
admires
her
but
at
that
moment
a
wave
of
hicks
s
fan
drew
them
hurriedly
from
their
embrasure
professor
darchivio
had
promised
to
explain
to
us
the
difference
between
the
sassanian
and
byzantine
motives
in
carolingian
art
but
the
manager
has
sent
up
word
that
the
two
new
creole
dancers
from
paris
have
arrived
and
her
serene
highness
wants
to
pop
down
to
the
and
take
a
peep
at
them
she
s
sure
the
professor
will
understand
and
accompany
us
of
course
the
princess
irresistibly
added
lansing
s
brief
colloquy
in
the
nouveau
luxe
window
had
lifted
the
scales
from
his
eyes
innumerable
dim
corners
of
memory
had
been
flooded
with
light
by
that
one
quick
glance
of
the
s
things
he
had
heard
hints
he
had
let
pass
smiles
insinuations
cordialities
rumours
of
the
improbability
of
the
prince
s
founding
a
family
suggestions
as
to
the
urgent
need
of
replenishing
the
teutoburger
treasury
miss
hicks
perforce
had
accompanied
her
parents
and
their
princely
guests
to
the
ballroom
but
as
she
did
not
dance
and
took
little
interest
in
the
sight
of
others
so
engaged
she
remained
aloof
from
the
party
absorbed
in
an
archaeological
discussion
with
the
baffled
but
smiling
savant
who
was
to
have
enlightened
the
party
on
the
difference
between
sassanian
and
byzantine
ornament
lansing
also
aloof
had
picked
out
a
post
from
which
he
could
observe
the
girl
she
wore
a
new
look
to
him
since
he
had
seen
her
as
the
centre
of
all
these
scattered
threads
of
intrigue
yes
decidedly
she
was
growing
handsomer
or
else
she
had
learned
how
to
set
off
her
massive
lines
instead
of
trying
to
disguise
them
as
she
held
up
her
long
to
glance
absently
at
the
dancers
he
was
struck
by
the
large
beauty
of
her
arm
and
the
careless
assurance
of
the
gesture
there
was
nothing
nervous
or
fussy
about
coral
hicks
and
he
was
not
surprised
that
plastically
at
least
the
princess
mother
had
discerned
her
possibilities
nick
lansing
all
that
night
sat
up
and
stared
at
his
future
he
knew
enough
of
the
society
into
which
the
hickses
had
drifted
to
guess
that
within
a
very
short
time
the
hint
of
the
prince
s
would
reappear
in
the
form
of
a
direct
proposal
lansing
himself
would
probably
as
the
one
person
in
the
hicks
entourage
with
whom
one
could
intelligibly
commune
be
entrusted
with
the
next
step
in
the
negotiations
he
would
be
asked
as
the
would
have
said
to
feel
the
it
was
clearly
part
of
the
state
policy
of
teutoburg
to
offer
miss
hicks
with
the
hand
of
its
sovereign
an
opportunity
to
replenish
its
treasury
what
would
the
girl
do
lansing
could
not
guess
yet
he
dimly
felt
that
her
attitude
would
depend
in
a
great
degree
upon
his
own
and
he
knew
no
more
what
his
own
was
going
to
be
than
on
the
night
four
months
earlier
when
he
had
flung
out
of
his
wife
s
room
in
venice
to
take
the
midnight
express
for
genoa
the
whole
of
his
past
and
above
all
the
tendency
on
which
he
had
once
prided
himself
to
live
in
the
present
and
take
whatever
chances
it
offered
now
made
it
harder
for
him
to
act
he
began
to
see
that
he
had
never
even
in
the
closest
relations
of
life
looked
ahead
of
his
immediate
satisfaction
he
had
thought
it
rather
fine
to
be
able
to
give
himself
so
intensely
to
the
fullness
of
each
moment
instead
of
hurrying
past
it
in
pursuit
of
something
more
or
something
else
in
the
manner
of
the
or
the
whom
he
had
always
grouped
together
and
equally
pitied
it
was
not
till
he
had
linked
his
life
with
susy
s
that
he
had
begun
to
feel
it
reaching
forward
into
a
future
he
longed
to
make
sure
of
to
fasten
upon
and
shape
to
his
own
wants
and
purposes
till
by
an
imperceptible
substitution
that
future
had
become
his
real
present
his
moment
of
time
now
the
moment
was
shattered
and
the
power
to
rebuild
it
failed
him
he
had
never
before
thought
about
putting
together
broken
bits
he
felt
like
a
man
whose
house
has
been
wrecked
by
an
earthquake
and
who
for
lack
of
skilled
labour
is
called
upon
for
the
first
time
to
wield
a
trowel
and
carry
bricks
he
simply
did
not
know
how
he
saw
was
not
a
thing
one
could
suddenly
decree
oneself
to
possess
it
must
be
built
up
imperceptibly
and
laboriously
out
of
a
succession
of
small
efforts
to
meet
definite
objects
out
of
the
facing
of
daily
difficulties
instead
of
cleverly
eluding
them
or
shifting
their
burden
on
others
the
making
of
the
substance
called
character
was
a
process
about
as
slow
and
arduous
as
the
building
of
the
pyramids
and
the
thing
itself
like
those
awful
edifices
was
mainly
useful
to
lodge
one
s
descendants
in
after
they
too
were
dust
yet
the
was
the
one
which
had
made
the
world
made
man
and
caused
his
fugitive
joys
to
linger
like
fading
frescoes
on
imperishable
walls
xxi
on
the
drive
back
from
her
dinner
at
the
nouveau
luxe
events
had
followed
the
course
foreseen
by
susy
she
had
promised
strefford
to
seek
legal
advice
about
her
divorce
and
he
had
kissed
her
and
the
promise
had
been
easier
to
make
than
she
had
expected
the
kiss
less
difficult
to
receive
she
had
gone
to
the
dinner
with
the
mortification
of
learning
that
her
husband
was
still
with
the
hickses
morally
sure
of
it
though
she
had
been
the
discovery
was
a
shock
and
she
measured
for
the
first
time
the
abyss
between
fearing
and
knowing
no
wonder
he
had
not
written
the
modern
husband
did
not
have
to
he
had
only
to
leave
it
to
time
and
the
newspapers
to
make
known
his
intentions
susy
could
imagine
nick
s
saying
to
himself
as
he
sometimes
used
to
say
when
she
reminded
him
of
an
unanswered
letter
but
there
are
lots
of
ways
of
answering
a
letter
and
writing
doesn
t
happen
to
be
well
he
had
done
it
in
his
way
and
she
was
answered
for
a
minute
as
she
laid
aside
the
paper
darkness
submerged
her
and
she
felt
herself
dropping
down
into
the
bottomless
anguish
of
her
dreadful
vigil
in
the
palazzo
vanderlyn
but
she
was
weary
of
anguish
her
healthy
body
and
nerves
instinctively
rejected
it
the
wave
was
spent
and
she
felt
herself
irresistibly
struggling
back
to
light
and
life
and
youth
he
didn
t
want
her
well
she
would
try
not
to
want
him
there
lay
all
the
old
expedients
at
her
hand
the
rouge
for
her
white
lips
the
atropine
for
her
blurred
eyes
the
new
dress
on
her
bed
the
thought
of
strefford
and
his
guests
awaiting
her
and
of
the
conclusions
that
the
diners
of
the
nouveau
luxe
would
draw
from
seeing
them
together
thank
heaven
no
one
would
say
poor
old
susy
did
you
know
nick
had
chucked
her
they
would
all
say
poor
old
nick
yes
i
daresay
she
was
sorry
to
chuck
him
but
altringham
s
mad
to
marry
her
and
what
could
she
do
and
once
again
events
had
followed
the
course
she
had
foreseen
seeing
her
at
lord
altringham
s
table
with
the
ascots
and
the
old
duchess
of
dunes
the
interested
spectators
could
not
but
regard
the
dinner
as
confirming
the
rumour
of
her
marriage
as
ellie
said
people
didn
t
wait
nowadays
to
announce
their
engagements
till
the
tiresome
divorce
proceedings
were
over
ellie
herself
prodigally
pearled
and
ermined
had
floated
in
late
with
algie
bockheimer
in
her
wake
and
sat
in
conspicuous
nodding
and
signalling
her
sympathy
to
susy
approval
beamed
from
every
eye
it
was
awfully
exciting
they
all
seemed
to
say
seeing
susy
lansing
pull
it
off
as
the
party
after
dinner
drifted
from
the
restaurant
back
into
the
hall
she
caught
in
the
smiles
and
crowding
about
her
the
hint
of
official
congratulations
and
violet
melrose
seated
in
a
corner
with
fulmer
drew
her
down
with
a
wan
arm
to
whisper
tenderly
it
s
most
awfully
clever
of
you
darling
not
to
be
wearing
any
in
all
the
women
s
eyes
she
read
the
reflected
lustre
of
the
jewels
she
could
wear
when
she
chose
it
was
as
though
their
glitter
reached
her
from
the
bank
where
they
lay
sealed
up
in
the
altringham
what
a
fool
she
had
been
to
think
that
strefford
would
ever
believe
she
didn
t
care
for
them
the
ambassadress
a
blank
perpendicular
person
had
been
a
shade
less
affable
than
susy
could
have
wished
but
then
there
was
lady
joan
and
the
girl
was
handsome
alarmingly
handsome
to
account
for
that
probably
every
one
in
the
room
had
guessed
it
and
the
old
duchess
of
dunes
was
delightful
she
looked
rather
like
strefford
in
a
wig
and
false
pearls
susy
was
sure
they
were
as
false
as
her
teeth
and
her
cordiality
was
so
demonstrative
that
the
future
bride
found
it
more
difficult
to
account
for
than
lady
ascot
s
coldness
till
she
heard
the
old
lady
as
they
passed
into
the
hall
breathe
in
a
hissing
whisper
to
her
nephew
streff
dearest
when
you
have
a
minute
s
time
and
can
drop
in
at
my
wretched
little
pension
i
know
you
can
explain
in
two
words
what
i
ought
to
do
to
pacify
those
awful
and
you
ll
bring
your
exquisite
american
to
see
me
won
t
you
no
joan
senechal
s
too
fair
for
my
taste
insipid
yes
the
taste
of
it
all
was
again
sweet
on
her
lips
a
few
days
later
she
began
to
wonder
how
the
thought
of
strefford
s
endearments
could
have
been
so
alarming
to
be
sure
he
was
not
lavish
of
them
but
when
he
did
touch
her
even
when
he
kissed
her
it
no
longer
seemed
to
matter
an
almost
complete
absence
of
sensation
had
mercifully
succeeded
to
the
first
wild
flurry
of
her
nerves
and
so
it
would
be
no
doubt
with
everything
else
in
her
new
life
if
it
failed
to
provoke
any
acute
reactions
whether
of
pain
or
pleasure
the
very
absence
of
sensation
would
make
for
peace
and
in
the
meanwhile
she
was
tasting
what
she
had
begun
to
suspect
was
the
maximum
of
bliss
to
most
of
the
women
she
knew
days
packed
with
engagements
the
exhilaration
of
fashionable
crowds
the
thrill
of
snapping
up
a
jewel
or
a
bibelot
or
a
new
model
that
one
s
best
friend
wanted
or
of
being
invited
to
some
private
show
or
some
exclusive
entertainment
that
one
s
best
friend
couldn
t
get
to
there
was
nothing
now
that
she
couldn
t
buy
nowhere
that
she
couldn
t
go
she
had
only
to
choose
and
to
triumph
and
for
a
while
the
of
her
life
gave
her
the
illusion
of
enjoyment
strefford
as
she
had
expected
had
postponed
his
return
to
england
and
they
had
now
been
for
nearly
three
weeks
together
in
their
new
and
virtually
avowed
relation
she
had
fancied
that
after
all
the
easiest
part
of
it
would
be
just
the
being
with
strefford
the
falling
back
on
their
old
tried
friendship
to
efface
the
sense
of
strangeness
but
though
she
had
so
soon
grown
used
to
his
caresses
he
himself
remained
curiously
unfamiliar
she
was
hardly
sure
at
times
that
it
was
the
old
strefford
she
was
talking
to
it
was
not
that
his
point
of
view
had
changed
but
that
new
things
occupied
and
absorbed
him
in
all
the
small
sides
of
his
great
situation
he
took
an
almost
childish
satisfaction
and
though
he
still
laughed
at
both
its
privileges
and
its
obligations
it
was
now
with
a
jealous
laughter
it
amused
him
inexhaustibly
for
instance
to
be
made
up
to
by
all
the
people
who
had
always
disapproved
of
him
and
to
unite
at
the
same
table
persons
who
had
to
dissemble
their
annoyance
at
being
invited
together
lest
they
should
not
be
invited
at
all
equally
exhilarating
was
the
capricious
favouring
of
the
dull
and
dowdy
on
occasions
when
the
brilliant
and
disreputable
expected
his
notice
it
enchanted
him
for
example
to
ask
the
old
duchess
of
dunes
and
violet
melrose
to
dine
with
the
vicar
of
altringham
on
his
way
to
switzerland
for
a
month
s
holiday
and
to
watch
the
face
of
the
vicar
s
wife
while
the
duchess
narrated
her
last
difficulties
with
and
and
violet
proclaimed
the
rights
of
love
and
genius
to
all
that
had
once
been
supposed
to
belong
exclusively
to
respectability
and
dulness
susy
had
to
confess
that
her
own
amusements
were
hardly
of
a
higher
order
but
then
she
put
up
with
them
for
lack
of
better
whereas
strefford
who
might
have
had
what
he
pleased
was
completely
satisfied
with
such
triumphs
somehow
in
spite
of
his
honours
and
his
opportunities
he
seemed
to
have
shrunk
the
old
strefford
had
certainly
been
a
larger
person
and
she
wondered
if
material
prosperity
were
always
a
beginning
of
ossification
strefford
had
been
much
more
fun
when
he
lived
by
his
wits
sometimes
now
when
he
tried
to
talk
of
politics
or
assert
himself
on
some
question
of
public
interest
she
was
startled
by
his
limitations
formerly
when
he
was
not
sure
of
his
ground
it
had
been
his
way
to
turn
the
difficulty
by
glib
nonsense
or
easy
irony
now
he
was
actually
dull
at
times
almost
pompous
she
noticed
too
for
the
first
time
that
he
did
not
always
hear
clearly
when
several
people
were
talking
at
once
or
when
he
was
at
the
theatre
and
he
developed
a
habit
of
saying
over
and
over
again
does
speak
indistinctly
or
am
i
getting
deaf
i
wonder
which
wore
on
her
nerves
by
its
suggestion
of
a
corresponding
mental
infirmity
these
thoughts
did
not
always
trouble
her
the
current
of
idle
activity
on
which
they
were
both
gliding
was
her
native
element
as
well
as
his
and
never
had
its
tide
been
as
swift
its
waves
as
buoyant
in
his
relation
to
her
too
he
was
full
of
tact
and
consideration
she
saw
that
he
still
remembered
their
frightened
exchange
of
glances
after
their
first
kiss
and
the
sense
of
this
little
hidden
spring
of
imagination
in
him
was
sometimes
enough
for
her
thirst
she
had
always
had
a
rather
masculine
punctuality
in
keeping
her
word
and
after
she
had
promised
strefford
to
take
steps
toward
a
divorce
she
had
promptly
set
about
doing
it
a
sudden
reluctance
prevented
her
asking
the
advice
of
friends
like
ellie
vanderlyn
whom
she
knew
to
be
in
the
thick
of
the
same
negotiations
and
all
she
could
think
of
was
to
consult
a
young
american
lawyer
practicing
in
paris
with
whom
she
felt
she
could
talk
the
more
easily
because
he
was
not
from
new
york
and
probably
unacquainted
with
her
history
she
was
so
ignorant
of
the
procedure
in
such
matters
that
she
was
surprised
and
relieved
at
his
asking
few
personal
questions
but
it
was
a
shock
to
learn
that
a
divorce
could
not
be
obtained
either
in
new
york
or
paris
merely
on
the
ground
of
desertion
or
incompatibility
i
thought
nowadays
if
people
preferred
to
live
apart
it
could
always
be
managed
she
stammered
wondering
at
her
own
ignorance
after
the
many
conjugal
ruptures
she
had
assisted
at
the
young
lawyer
smiled
and
coloured
slightly
his
lovely
client
evidently
intimidated
him
by
her
grace
and
still
more
by
her
inexperience
it
can
be
generally
he
admitted
and
especially
so
if
as
i
gather
is
the
case
your
husband
is
equally
anxious
oh
quite
she
exclaimed
suddenly
humiliated
by
having
to
admit
it
well
then
may
i
suggest
that
to
bring
matters
to
a
point
the
best
way
would
be
for
you
to
write
to
him
she
recoiled
slightly
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
the
lawyers
would
not
manage
it
without
her
intervention
write
to
him
but
what
about
well
expressing
your
wish
to
recover
your
freedom
the
rest
i
assume
said
the
young
lawyer
may
be
left
to
she
did
not
know
exactly
what
he
meant
and
was
too
much
perturbed
by
the
idea
of
having
to
communicate
with
nick
to
follow
any
other
train
of
thought
how
could
she
write
such
a
letter
and
yet
how
could
she
confess
to
the
lawyer
that
she
had
not
the
courage
to
do
so
he
would
of
course
tell
her
to
go
home
and
be
reconciled
she
hesitated
perplexedly
wouldn
t
it
be
better
she
suggested
if
the
letter
were
to
come
from
from
your
office
he
considered
this
politely
on
the
whole
no
if
as
i
take
it
an
amicable
arrangement
is
necessary
to
secure
the
requisite
evidence
then
a
line
from
you
suggesting
an
interview
seems
to
me
more
an
interview
is
an
interview
necessary
she
was
ashamed
to
show
her
agitation
to
this
cautiously
smiling
young
man
who
must
wonder
at
her
childish
lack
of
understanding
but
the
break
in
her
voice
was
uncontrollable
oh
please
write
to
him
i
can
t
and
i
can
t
see
him
oh
can
t
you
arrange
it
for
me
she
pleaded
she
saw
now
that
her
idea
of
a
divorce
had
been
that
it
was
something
one
went
out
or
sent
out
to
buy
in
a
shop
something
concrete
and
portable
that
strefford
s
money
could
pay
for
and
that
it
required
no
personal
participation
to
obtain
what
a
fool
the
lawyer
must
think
her
stiffening
herself
she
rose
from
her
seat
my
husband
and
i
don
t
wish
to
see
each
other
again
i
m
sure
it
would
be
useless
and
very
you
are
the
best
judge
of
course
but
in
any
case
a
letter
from
you
a
friendly
letter
seems
wiser
considering
the
apparent
lack
of
evidence
very
well
then
i
ll
write
she
agreed
and
hurried
away
scarcely
hearing
his
parting
injunction
that
she
should
take
a
copy
of
her
letter
that
night
she
wrote
at
the
last
moment
it
might
have
been
impossible
if
at
the
theatre
little
breckenridge
had
not
bobbed
into
her
box
he
was
just
back
from
rome
where
he
had
dined
with
the
hickses
a
show
they
re
really
lances
you
wouldn
t
know
them
and
had
met
there
lansing
whom
he
reported
as
intending
to
marry
coral
as
soon
as
things
were
settled
you
were
dead
right
weren
t
you
susy
he
snickered
that
night
in
venice
last
summer
when
we
all
thought
you
were
joking
about
their
engagement
pity
now
you
chucked
our
surprise
visit
to
the
hickses
and
sent
streff
up
to
drag
us
back
just
as
we
were
breaking
in
you
remember
he
flung
off
the
streff
airily
in
the
old
way
but
with
a
tentative
at
his
host
and
lord
altringham
leaning
toward
susy
said
coldly
was
breckenridge
speaking
about
me
i
didn
t
catch
what
he
said
does
he
speak
indistinctly
or
am
i
getting
deaf
i
wonder
after
that
it
seemed
comparatively
easy
when
strefford
had
dropped
her
at
her
hotel
to
go
upstairs
and
write
she
dashed
off
the
date
and
her
address
and
then
stopped
but
suddenly
she
remembered
breckenridge
s
snicker
and
the
words
rushed
from
her
nick
dear
it
was
july
when
you
left
venice
and
i
have
had
no
word
from
you
since
the
note
in
which
you
said
you
had
gone
for
a
few
days
and
that
i
should
hear
soon
again
you
haven
t
written
yet
and
it
is
five
months
since
you
left
me
that
means
i
suppose
that
you
want
to
take
back
your
freedom
and
give
me
mine
wouldn
t
it
be
kinder
in
that
case
to
tell
me
so
it
is
worse
than
anything
to
go
on
as
we
are
now
i
don
t
know
how
to
put
these
things
but
since
you
seem
unwilling
to
write
to
me
perhaps
you
would
prefer
to
send
your
answer
to
frederic
spearman
the
american
lawyer
here
his
address
is
boulevard
haussmann
i
hope
she
broke
off
on
the
last
word
hope
what
did
she
hope
either
for
him
or
for
herself
wishes
for
his
welfare
would
sound
like
a
mockery
and
she
would
rather
her
letter
should
seem
bitter
than
unfeeling
above
all
she
wanted
to
get
it
done
to
have
to
even
those
few
lines
would
be
torture
so
she
left
i
hope
and
simply
added
to
hear
before
long
what
you
have
she
read
it
over
and
shivered
not
one
word
of
the
past
not
one
allusion
to
that
mysterious
interweaving
of
their
lives
which
had
enclosed
them
one
in
the
other
like
the
flower
in
its
sheath
what
place
had
such
memories
in
such
a
letter
she
had
the
feeling
that
she
wanted
to
hide
that
other
nick
away
in
her
own
bosom
and
with
him
the
other
susy
the
susy
he
had
once
imagined
her
to
be
neither
of
them
seemed
concerned
with
the
present
business
the
letter
done
she
stared
at
the
sealed
envelope
till
its
presence
in
the
room
became
intolerable
and
she
understood
that
she
must
either
tear
it
up
or
post
it
immediately
she
went
down
to
the
hall
of
the
sleeping
hotel
and
bribed
the
to
carry
the
letter
to
the
nearest
post
office
though
he
objected
that
at
that
hour
no
time
would
be
gained
i
want
it
out
of
the
house
she
insisted
and
waited
sternly
by
the
desk
in
her
till
he
had
performed
the
errand
as
she
her
room
the
disordered
struck
her
and
she
remembered
the
lawyer
s
injunction
to
take
a
copy
of
her
letter
a
copy
to
be
filed
away
with
the
documents
in
lansing
versus
lansing
she
burst
out
laughing
at
the
idea
what
were
lawyers
made
of
she
wondered
didn
t
the
man
guess
by
the
mere
look
in
her
eyes
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
that
she
would
never
as
long
as
she
lived
forget
a
word
of
that
letter
that
night
after
night
she
would
lie
down
as
she
was
lying
down
to
stare
for
hours
into
the
darkness
while
a
voice
in
her
brain
monotonously
hammered
out
nick
dear
it
was
july
when
you
left
me
and
so
on
word
after
word
down
to
the
last
fatal
syllable
xxii
strefford
was
leaving
for
england
once
assured
that
susy
had
taken
the
first
step
toward
freeing
herself
he
frankly
regarded
her
as
his
affianced
wife
and
could
see
no
reason
for
further
mystery
she
understood
his
impatience
to
have
their
plans
settled
it
would
protect
him
from
the
formidable
menace
of
the
marriageable
and
cause
people
as
he
said
to
stop
meddling
now
that
the
novelty
of
his
situation
was
wearing
off
his
natural
indolence
reasserted
itself
and
there
was
nothing
he
dreaded
more
than
having
to
be
on
his
guard
against
the
innumerable
plans
that
his
were
perpetually
making
for
him
sometimes
susy
fancied
he
was
marrying
her
because
to
do
so
was
to
follow
the
line
of
least
resistance
to
marry
me
is
the
easiest
way
of
not
marrying
all
the
others
she
laughed
as
he
stood
before
her
one
day
in
a
quiet
alley
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
insisting
on
the
settlement
of
various
preliminaries
i
believe
i
m
only
a
protection
to
an
odd
gleam
passed
behind
his
eyes
and
she
instantly
guessed
that
he
was
thinking
and
what
else
am
i
to
you
she
changed
colour
and
he
rejoined
laughing
also
well
you
re
that
at
any
rate
thank
the
lord
she
pondered
and
then
questioned
but
in
the
interval
how
are
you
going
to
defend
yourself
for
another
year
ah
you
ve
got
to
see
to
that
you
ve
got
to
take
a
little
house
in
london
you
ve
got
to
look
after
me
you
it
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
flash
back
oh
if
that
s
all
you
care
but
caring
was
exactly
the
factor
she
wanted
as
much
as
possible
to
keep
out
of
their
talk
and
their
thoughts
she
could
not
ask
him
how
much
he
cared
without
laying
herself
open
to
the
same
question
and
that
way
terror
lay
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
strefford
was
not
an
ardent
wooer
perhaps
from
tact
perhaps
from
temperament
perhaps
merely
from
the
long
habit
of
belittling
and
disintegrating
every
sentiment
and
every
conviction
yet
she
knew
he
did
care
for
her
as
much
as
he
was
capable
of
caring
for
anyone
if
the
element
of
habit
entered
largely
into
the
feeling
if
he
liked
her
above
all
because
he
was
used
to
her
knew
her
views
her
indulgences
her
allowances
knew
he
was
never
likely
to
be
bored
and
almost
certain
to
be
amused
by
her
why
such
ingredients
though
not
of
the
fieriest
were
perhaps
those
most
likely
to
keep
his
feeling
for
her
at
a
pleasant
temperature
she
had
had
a
taste
of
the
tropics
and
wanted
more
equable
weather
but
the
idea
of
having
to
fan
his
flame
gently
for
a
year
was
unspeakably
depressing
to
her
yet
all
this
was
precisely
what
she
could
not
say
the
long
period
of
probation
during
which
as
she
knew
she
would
have
to
amuse
him
to
guard
him
to
hold
him
and
to
keep
off
the
other
women
was
a
necessary
part
of
their
situation
she
was
sure
that
as
little
breckenridge
would
have
said
she
could
pull
it
off
but
she
did
not
want
to
think
about
it
what
she
would
have
preferred
would
have
been
to
go
away
no
matter
where
and
not
see
strefford
again
till
they
were
married
but
she
dared
not
tell
him
that
either
a
little
house
in
london
she
wondered
well
i
suppose
you
ve
got
to
have
some
sort
of
a
roof
over
your
i
suppose
he
sat
down
beside
her
if
you
like
me
well
enough
to
live
at
altringham
some
day
won
t
you
in
the
meantime
let
me
provide
you
with
a
smaller
and
more
convenient
establishment
still
she
hesitated
the
alternative
she
knew
would
be
to
live
on
ursula
gillow
violet
melrose
or
some
other
of
her
rich
friends
any
one
of
whom
would
be
ready
to
lavish
the
largest
hospitality
on
the
prospective
lady
altringham
such
an
arrangement
in
the
long
run
would
be
no
less
humiliating
to
her
pride
no
less
destructive
to
her
independence
than
altringham
s
little
establishment
but
she
temporized
i
shall
go
over
to
london
in
december
and
stay
for
a
while
with
various
people
then
we
can
look
all
right
as
you
he
obviously
considered
her
hesitation
ridiculous
but
was
too
full
of
satisfaction
at
her
having
started
divorce
proceedings
to
be
chilled
by
her
reply
and
now
look
here
my
dear
couldn
t
i
give
you
some
sort
of
a
ring
a
ring
she
flushed
at
the
suggestion
what
s
the
use
streff
dear
with
all
those
jewels
locked
away
in
london
oh
i
daresay
you
ll
think
them
and
hang
it
why
shouldn
t
i
give
you
something
new
i
ran
across
ellie
and
bockheimer
yesterday
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
picking
out
sapphires
do
you
like
sapphires
or
emeralds
or
just
a
diamond
i
ve
seen
a
thumping
one
i
d
like
you
to
have
ellie
and
bockheimer
how
she
hated
the
conjunction
of
the
names
their
case
always
seemed
to
her
like
a
caricature
of
her
own
and
she
felt
an
unreasoning
resentment
against
ellie
for
having
selected
the
same
season
for
her
unmating
and
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
speak
of
them
streff
as
if
they
were
like
us
i
can
hardly
bear
to
sit
in
the
same
room
with
ellie
hullo
what
s
wrong
you
mean
because
of
her
giving
up
clarissa
not
that
only
you
don
t
know
i
can
t
tell
you
she
shivered
at
the
memory
and
rose
restlessly
from
the
bench
where
they
had
been
sitting
strefford
gave
his
careless
shrug
well
my
dear
you
can
hardly
expect
me
to
agree
for
after
all
it
was
to
ellie
i
owed
the
luck
of
being
so
long
alone
with
you
in
venice
if
she
and
algie
hadn
t
prolonged
their
honeymoon
at
the
villa
he
stopped
abruptly
and
looked
at
susy
she
was
conscious
that
every
drop
of
blood
had
left
her
face
she
felt
it
ebbing
away
from
her
heart
flowing
out
of
her
as
if
from
all
her
severed
arteries
till
it
seemed
as
though
nothing
were
left
of
life
in
her
but
one
point
of
irreducible
pain
ellie
at
your
villa
what
do
you
mean
was
it
ellie
and
bockheimer
who
strefford
still
stared
you
mean
to
say
you
didn
t
know
who
came
after
nick
and
me
she
insisted
why
do
you
suppose
i
d
have
turned
you
out
otherwise
that
beastly
bockheimer
simply
smothered
me
with
gold
ah
well
there
s
one
good
thing
i
shall
never
have
to
let
the
villa
again
i
rather
like
the
little
place
myself
and
i
daresay
once
in
a
while
we
might
go
there
for
a
day
or
two
susy
what
s
the
matter
he
exclaimed
she
returned
his
stare
but
without
seeing
him
everything
swam
and
danced
before
her
eyes
then
she
was
there
while
i
was
posting
all
those
letters
for
her
letters
what
letters
what
makes
you
look
so
frightfully
upset
she
pursued
her
thought
as
if
he
had
not
spoken
she
and
algie
bockheimer
arrived
there
the
very
day
that
nick
and
i
left
i
suppose
so
i
thought
she
d
told
you
ellie
always
tells
everybody
she
would
have
told
me
i
daresay
but
i
wouldn
t
let
well
my
dear
that
was
hardly
my
fault
was
it
though
i
really
don
t
see
but
susy
still
blind
to
everything
but
the
dance
of
dizzy
sparks
before
her
eyes
pressed
on
as
if
she
had
not
heard
him
it
was
their
motor
then
that
took
us
to
milan
it
was
algie
bockheimer
s
motor
she
did
not
know
why
but
this
seemed
to
her
the
most
humiliating
incident
in
the
whole
hateful
business
she
remembered
nick
s
reluctance
to
use
the
motor
she
remembered
his
look
when
she
had
boasted
of
her
the
nausea
mounted
to
her
throat
strefford
burst
out
laughing
i
say
you
borrowed
their
motor
and
you
didn
t
know
whose
it
was
how
could
i
know
i
persuaded
the
chauffeur
for
a
little
tip
it
was
to
save
our
railway
fares
to
milan
extra
luggage
costs
so
frightfully
in
italy
good
old
susy
well
done
i
can
see
you
doing
it
oh
how
horrible
how
horrible
she
groaned
horrible
what
s
horrible
why
your
not
seeing
not
feeling
she
began
impetuously
and
then
stopped
how
could
she
explain
to
him
that
what
revolted
her
was
not
so
much
the
fact
of
his
having
given
the
little
house
as
soon
as
she
and
nick
had
left
it
to
those
two
people
of
all
others
though
the
vision
of
them
in
the
sweet
secret
house
and
under
the
of
the
terrace
drew
such
a
trail
of
slime
across
her
golden
hours
no
it
was
not
that
from
which
she
most
recoiled
but
from
the
fact
that
strefford
living
in
luxury
in
nelson
vanderlyn
s
house
should
at
the
same
time
have
secretly
abetted
ellie
vanderlyn
s
and
allowed
her
for
a
handsome
price
to
shelter
them
under
his
own
roof
the
reproach
trembled
on
her
lip
but
she
remembered
her
own
part
in
the
wretched
business
and
the
impossibility
of
avowing
it
to
strefford
and
of
revealing
to
him
that
nick
had
left
her
for
that
very
reason
she
was
not
afraid
that
the
discovery
would
diminish
her
in
strefford
s
eyes
he
was
untroubled
by
moral
problems
and
would
laugh
away
her
avowal
with
a
sneer
at
nick
in
his
new
part
of
moralist
but
that
was
just
what
she
could
not
bear
that
anyone
should
cast
a
doubt
on
the
genuineness
of
nick
s
standards
or
should
know
how
far
below
them
she
had
fallen
she
remained
silent
and
strefford
after
a
moment
drew
her
gently
down
to
the
seat
beside
him
susy
upon
my
soul
i
don
t
know
what
you
re
driving
at
is
it
me
you
re
angry
with
or
yourself
and
what
s
it
all
about
are
you
disgusted
because
i
let
the
villa
to
a
couple
who
weren
t
married
but
hang
it
they
re
the
kind
that
pay
the
highest
price
and
i
had
to
earn
my
living
somehow
one
doesn
t
run
across
a
bridal
pair
every
day
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
puzzled
incredulous
face
poor
streff
no
it
was
not
with
him
that
she
was
angry
why
should
she
be
even
that
disclosure
had
told
her
nothing
she
had
not
already
known
about
him
it
had
simply
revealed
to
her
once
more
the
real
point
of
view
of
the
people
he
and
she
lived
among
had
shown
her
that
in
spite
of
the
superficial
difference
he
felt
as
they
felt
judged
as
they
judged
was
blind
as
they
were
and
as
she
would
be
expected
to
be
should
she
once
again
become
one
of
them
what
was
the
use
of
being
placed
by
fortune
above
such
shifts
and
compromises
if
in
one
s
heart
one
still
condoned
them
and
she
would
have
to
she
would
catch
the
general
note
grow
blunted
as
those
other
people
were
blunted
and
gradually
come
to
wonder
at
her
own
revolt
as
strefford
now
honestly
wondered
at
it
she
felt
as
though
she
were
on
the
point
of
losing
some
treasure
a
treasure
precious
only
to
herself
but
beside
which
all
he
offered
her
was
nothing
the
triumph
of
her
wounded
pride
nothing
the
security
of
her
future
nothing
what
is
it
susy
he
asked
with
the
same
puzzled
gentleness
ah
the
loneliness
of
never
being
able
to
make
him
understand
she
had
felt
lonely
enough
when
the
flaming
sword
of
nick
s
indignation
had
shut
her
out
from
their
paradise
but
there
had
been
a
cruel
bliss
in
the
pain
nick
had
not
opened
her
eyes
to
new
truths
but
had
waked
in
her
again
something
which
had
lain
unconscious
under
years
of
accumulated
indifference
and
that
sense
had
never
left
her
since
and
had
somehow
kept
her
from
utter
loneliness
because
it
was
a
secret
shared
with
nick
a
gift
she
owed
to
nick
and
which
in
leaving
her
he
could
not
take
from
her
it
was
almost
she
suddenly
felt
as
if
he
had
left
her
with
a
child
my
dear
girl
strefford
said
with
a
resigned
glance
at
his
watch
you
know
we
re
dining
at
the
embassy
at
the
embassy
she
looked
at
him
vaguely
then
she
remembered
yes
they
were
dining
that
night
at
the
ascots
with
strefford
s
cousin
the
duke
of
dunes
and
his
wife
the
handsome
irreproachable
young
duchess
with
the
old
gambling
dowager
duchess
whom
her
son
and
had
come
over
from
england
to
see
and
with
other
english
and
french
guests
of
a
rank
and
standing
worthy
of
the
duneses
susy
knew
that
her
inclusion
in
such
a
dinner
could
mean
but
one
thing
it
was
her
definite
recognition
as
altringham
s
future
wife
she
was
the
little
american
whom
one
had
to
ask
when
one
invited
him
even
on
ceremonial
occasions
the
family
had
accepted
her
the
embassy
could
but
follow
suit
it
s
late
dear
and
i
ve
got
to
see
someone
on
business
first
strefford
reminded
her
patiently
oh
streff
i
can
t
i
can
t
the
words
broke
from
her
without
her
knowing
what
she
was
saying
i
can
t
go
with
you
i
can
t
go
to
the
embassy
i
can
t
go
on
any
longer
like
this
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
in
desperate
appeal
oh
understand
do
please
understand
she
wailed
knowing
while
she
spoke
the
utter
impossibility
of
what
she
asked
strefford
s
face
had
gradually
paled
and
hardened
from
sallow
it
turned
to
a
dusky
white
and
lines
of
obstinacy
deepened
between
the
ironic
eyebrows
and
about
the
weak
amused
mouth
understand
what
do
you
want
me
to
understand
he
laughed
that
you
re
trying
to
chuck
me
already
she
shrank
at
the
sneer
of
the
already
but
instantly
remembered
that
it
was
the
only
thing
he
could
be
expected
to
say
since
it
was
just
because
he
couldn
t
understand
that
she
was
flying
from
him
oh
streff
if
i
knew
how
to
tell
you
it
doesn
t
so
much
matter
about
the
how
is
that
what
you
re
trying
to
say
her
head
drooped
and
she
saw
the
dead
leaves
whirling
across
the
path
at
her
feet
lifted
on
a
sudden
wintry
gust
the
reason
he
continued
clearing
his
throat
with
a
stiff
smile
is
not
quite
as
important
to
me
as
the
she
stood
speechless
agonized
by
his
pain
but
still
she
thought
he
had
remembered
the
dinner
at
the
embassy
the
thought
gave
her
courage
to
go
on
it
wouldn
t
do
streff
i
m
not
a
bit
the
kind
of
person
to
make
you
oh
leave
that
to
me
please
won
t
you
no
i
can
t
because
i
should
be
unhappy
he
clicked
at
the
leaves
as
they
whirled
past
you
ve
taken
a
rather
long
time
to
find
it
she
saw
that
his
sense
of
his
own
consequence
was
making
him
suffer
even
more
than
his
wounded
affection
and
that
again
gave
her
courage
if
i
ve
taken
long
it
s
all
the
more
reason
why
i
shouldn
t
take
longer
if
i
ve
made
a
mistake
it
s
you
who
would
have
suffered
from
it
thanks
he
said
for
your
extreme
she
looked
at
him
helplessly
penetrated
by
the
despairing
sense
of
their
inaccessibility
to
each
other
then
she
remembered
that
nick
during
their
last
talk
together
had
seemed
as
inaccessible
and
wondered
if
when
human
souls
try
to
get
too
near
each
other
they
do
not
inevitably
become
mere
blurs
to
each
other
s
vision
she
would
have
liked
to
say
this
to
streff
but
he
would
not
have
understood
it
either
the
sense
of
loneliness
once
more
enveloped
her
and
she
groped
in
vain
for
a
word
that
should
reach
him
let
me
go
home
alone
won
t
you
she
appealed
to
him
alone
she
nodded
he
tried
rather
valiantly
to
smile
hang
whatever
is
wrong
it
needn
t
prevent
my
seeing
you
he
glanced
toward
the
taxi
that
awaited
them
at
the
end
of
the
deserted
drive
no
please
you
re
in
a
hurry
take
the
taxi
i
want
immensely
a
long
long
walk
by
myself
through
the
streets
with
the
lights
coming
out
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
i
say
my
dear
you
re
not
ill
no
i
m
not
ill
but
you
may
say
i
am
at
the
he
released
her
and
drew
back
oh
very
well
he
answered
coldly
and
she
understood
by
his
tone
that
the
knot
was
cut
and
that
at
that
moment
he
almost
hated
her
she
turned
away
hastening
down
the
deserted
alley
flying
from
him
and
knowing
as
she
fled
that
he
was
still
standing
there
motionless
staring
after
her
wounded
humiliated
uncomprehending
it
was
neither
her
fault
nor
his
xxiii
as
she
fled
on
toward
the
lights
of
the
streets
a
breath
of
freedom
seemed
to
blow
into
her
face
like
a
weary
load
the
accumulated
hypocrisies
of
the
last
months
had
dropped
from
her
she
was
herself
again
nick
s
susy
and
no
one
else
s
she
sped
on
staring
with
bright
bewildered
eyes
at
the
stately
facades
of
the
la
muette
quarter
the
perspectives
of
bare
trees
the
awakening
glitter
of
holding
out
to
her
all
the
things
she
would
never
again
be
able
to
buy
in
an
avenue
of
shops
she
paused
before
a
milliner
s
window
and
said
to
herself
why
shouldn
t
i
earn
my
living
by
trimming
hats
she
met
streaming
out
under
a
doorway
and
scattering
to
catch
trams
and
omnibuses
and
she
looked
with
interest
at
their
tired
independent
faces
why
shouldn
t
i
earn
my
living
as
well
as
they
do
she
thought
a
little
farther
on
she
passed
a
sister
of
charity
with
softly
trotting
feet
a
calm
anonymous
glance
and
hands
hidden
in
her
capacious
sleeves
susy
looked
at
her
and
thought
why
shouldn
t
i
be
a
sister
and
have
no
money
to
worry
about
and
trot
about
under
a
white
coif
helping
poor
people
all
these
strangers
on
whom
she
smiled
in
passing
and
glanced
back
at
enviously
were
free
from
the
necessities
that
enslaved
her
and
would
not
have
known
what
she
meant
if
she
had
told
them
that
she
must
have
so
much
money
for
her
dresses
so
much
for
her
cigarettes
so
much
for
bridge
and
cabs
and
tips
and
all
kinds
of
extras
and
that
at
that
moment
she
ought
to
be
hurrying
back
to
a
dinner
at
the
british
embassy
where
her
permanent
right
to
such
luxuries
was
to
be
solemnly
recognized
and
ratified
the
artificiality
and
unreality
of
her
life
overcame
her
as
with
stifling
fumes
she
stopped
at
a
drawing
long
panting
breaths
as
if
she
had
been
running
a
race
then
slowly
and
aimlessly
she
began
to
saunter
along
a
street
of
small
private
houses
in
damp
gardens
that
led
to
the
avenue
du
bois
she
sat
down
on
a
bench
not
far
off
the
arc
de
triomphe
raised
its
august
bulk
and
beyond
it
a
river
of
lights
streamed
down
toward
paris
and
the
stir
of
the
city
s
troubled
the
quiet
in
her
bosom
but
not
for
long
she
seemed
to
be
looking
at
it
all
from
the
other
side
of
the
grave
and
as
she
got
up
and
wandered
down
the
champs
elysees
half
empty
in
the
evening
lull
between
dusk
and
dinner
she
felt
as
if
the
glittering
avenue
were
really
changed
into
the
field
of
shadows
from
which
it
takes
its
name
and
as
if
she
were
a
ghost
among
ghosts
halfway
home
a
weakness
of
loneliness
overcame
her
and
she
seated
herself
under
the
trees
near
the
rond
point
lines
of
motors
and
carriages
were
beginning
to
animate
the
converging
thoroughfares
streaming
abreast
crossing
winding
in
and
out
of
each
other
in
a
tangle
of
hurried
she
caught
the
light
on
jewels
and
and
hard
bored
eyes
emerging
from
dim
billows
of
fur
and
velvet
she
seemed
to
hear
what
the
couples
were
saying
to
each
other
she
pictured
the
restaurants
they
were
hastening
to
the
breathless
routine
that
was
hurrying
them
along
as
time
the
old
swept
them
away
with
the
dust
of
their
and
again
the
loneliness
vanished
in
a
sense
of
release
at
the
corner
of
the
place
de
la
concorde
she
stopped
recognizing
a
man
in
evening
dress
who
was
hailing
a
taxi
their
eyes
met
and
nelson
vanderlyn
came
forward
he
was
the
last
person
she
cared
to
run
across
and
she
shrank
back
involuntarily
what
did
he
know
what
had
he
guessed
of
her
complicity
in
his
wife
s
affairs
no
doubt
ellie
had
blabbed
it
all
out
by
this
time
she
was
just
as
likely
to
confide
her
to
nelson
as
to
anyone
else
now
that
the
bockheimer
prize
was
landed
well
well
well
so
i
ve
caught
you
at
it
glad
to
see
you
susy
my
she
found
her
hand
cordially
clasped
in
vanderlyn
s
and
his
round
pink
face
bent
on
her
with
all
its
old
urbanity
did
nothing
matter
then
in
this
world
she
was
fleeing
from
did
no
one
love
or
hate
or
remember
no
idea
you
were
in
paris
just
got
here
myself
vanderlyn
continued
visibly
delighted
at
the
meeting
look
here
don
t
suppose
you
re
out
of
a
job
this
evening
by
any
chance
and
would
come
and
cheer
up
a
lone
bachelor
eh
no
you
are
well
that
s
luck
for
once
i
say
where
shall
we
go
one
of
the
places
where
they
dance
i
suppose
yes
i
twirl
the
light
fantastic
once
in
a
while
myself
got
to
keep
up
with
the
times
hold
on

here
i
ll
drive
you
home
first
and
wait
while
you
jump
into
your
toggery
lots
of
as
he
steered
her
toward
the
carriage
she
noticed
that
he
had
a
gouty
limp
and
pulled
himself
in
after
her
with
difficulty
mayn
t
i
come
as
i
am
nelson
i
don
t
feel
like
dancing
let
s
go
and
dine
in
one
of
those
nice
smoky
little
restaurants
by
the
place
de
la
he
seemed
surprised
but
relieved
at
the
suggestion
and
they
rolled
off
together
in
a
corner
at
bauge
s
they
found
a
quiet
table
screened
from
the
other
diners
and
while
vanderlyn
adjusted
his
eyeglasses
to
study
the
carte
susy
stole
a
long
look
at
him
he
was
dressed
with
even
more
than
his
usual
formal
trimness
and
she
detected
in
an
and
discreetly
expensive
waistcoat
buttons
an
attempt
at
smartness
altogether
new
his
face
had
undergone
the
same
change
its
familiar
look
of
worn
optimism
had
been
as
it
were
done
up
to
match
his
clothes
as
though
a
sort
of
moral
cosmetic
had
made
him
pinker
shinier
and
sprightlier
without
really
rejuvenating
him
a
thin
veil
of
high
spirits
had
merely
been
drawn
over
his
face
as
the
shining
strands
of
hair
were
skilfully
brushed
over
his
baldness
here
carte
des
vins
waiter
what
champagne
susy
he
chose
fastidiously
the
best
the
cellar
could
produce
grumbling
a
little
at
the
bourgeois
character
of
the
dishes
capital
food
of
its
kind
no
doubt
but
coarsish
don
t
you
think
well
i
don
t
mind
it
s
rather
a
jolly
change
from
the
luxe
cooking
a
new
sensation
i
m
all
for
new
sensations
ain
t
you
my
dear
he
their
champagne
glasses
flung
an
arm
sideways
over
his
chair
and
smiled
at
her
with
a
foggy
benevolence
as
the
champagne
flowed
his
confidences
flowed
with
it
suppose
you
know
what
i
m
here
for
this
divorce
business
we
wanted
to
settle
it
quietly
without
a
fuss
and
of
course
paris
is
the
best
place
for
that
sort
of
job
live
and
let
live
no
questions
asked
none
of
your
dirty
newspapers
great
country
this
no
hypocrisy
they
understand
life
over
here
susy
gazed
and
listened
she
remembered
that
people
had
thought
nelson
would
make
a
row
when
he
found
out
he
had
always
been
addicted
to
truculent
anecdotes
about
unfaithful
wives
and
the
very
formula
of
his
perpetual
ejaculation
caught
you
at
it
eh
seemed
to
hint
at
a
constant
preoccupation
with
such
ideas
but
now
it
was
evident
that
as
the
saying
was
he
had
swallowed
his
dose
like
all
the
others
no
strong
blast
of
indignation
had
momentarily
lifted
him
above
his
normal
stature
he
remained
a
little
man
among
little
men
and
his
eagerness
to
rebuild
his
life
with
all
the
old
smiling
optimism
reminded
susy
of
the
patient
industry
of
an
ant
remaking
its
ruined
tell
you
what
great
thing
this
liberty
everything
s
changed
nowadays
why
shouldn
t
marriage
be
too
a
man
can
get
out
of
a
business
partnership
when
he
wants
to
but
the
parsons
want
to
keep
us
noosed
up
to
each
other
for
life
because
we
ve
blundered
into
a
church
one
day
and
said
yes
before
one
of
em
no
no
that
s
too
easy
we
ve
got
beyond
that
science
and
all
these
new
discoveries
i
say
the
ten
commandments
were
made
for
man
and
not
man
for
the
commandments
and
there
ain
t
a
word
against
divorce
in
em
anyhow
that
s
what
i
tell
my
poor
old
mother
who
builds
everything
on
her
bible
find
me
the
place
where
it
says
thou
shalt
not
sue
for
it
makes
her
wild
poor
old
lady
because
she
can
t
and
she
doesn
t
know
how
they
happen
to
have
left
it
out
i
rather
think
moses
left
it
out
because
he
knew
more
about
human
nature
than
these
snivelling
modern
parsons
do
not
that
they
ll
always
bear
investigating
either
but
i
don
t
care
about
that
live
and
let
live
eh
susy
haven
t
we
all
got
a
right
to
our
affinities
i
hear
you
re
following
our
example
yourself
idea
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
i
saw
it
coming
on
last
summer
at
venice
caught
you
at
it
so
to
speak
old
nelson
ain
t
as
blind
as
people
think
here
let
s
open
another
bottle
to
the
health
of
streff
and
streff
she
caught
the
hand
with
which
he
was
signalling
to
the
sommelier
this
flushed
and
garrulous
nelson
moved
her
more
poignantly
than
a
more
heroic
figure
no
more
champagne
please
nelson
besides
she
suddenly
added
it
s
not
he
stared
not
true
that
you
re
going
to
marry
altringham
by
george
then
what
on
earth
did
you
chuck
nick
for
ain
t
you
got
an
affinity
my
dear
she
laughed
and
shook
her
head
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
it
s
all
nick
s
doing
then
i
don
t
know
let
s
talk
of
you
instead
nelson
i
m
glad
you
re
in
such
good
spirits
i
rather
thought
he
interrupted
her
quickly
thought
i
d
cut
up
a
rumpus
do
some
shooting
i
know
people
he
twisted
his
moustache
evidently
proud
of
his
reputation
well
maybe
i
did
see
red
for
a
day
or
two
but
i
m
a
philosopher
first
and
last
before
i
went
into
banking
i
d
made
and
lost
two
fortunes
out
west
well
how
did
i
build
em
up
again
not
by
shooting
anybody
even
myself
by
just
buckling
to
and
beginning
all
over
again
that
s
how
and
that
s
what
i
am
doing
now
beginning
all
over
his
voice
dropped
from
boastfulness
to
a
note
of
wistful
melancholy
the
look
of
strained
jauntiness
fell
from
his
face
like
a
mask
and
for
an
instant
she
saw
the
real
man
old
ruined
lonely
yes
that
was
it
he
was
lonely
desperately
lonely
foundering
in
such
deep
seas
of
solitude
that
any
presence
out
of
the
past
was
like
a
spar
to
which
he
clung
whatever
he
knew
or
guessed
of
the
part
she
had
played
in
his
disaster
it
was
not
callousness
that
had
made
him
greet
her
with
such
forgiving
warmth
but
the
same
sense
of
smallness
insignificance
and
isolation
which
perpetually
hung
like
a
cold
fog
on
her
own
horizon
suddenly
she
too
felt
old
old
and
unspeakably
tired
it
s
been
nice
seeing
you
nelson
but
now
i
must
be
getting
he
offered
no
objection
but
asked
for
the
bill
resumed
his
jaunty
air
while
he
scattered
largesse
among
the
waiters
and
sauntered
out
behind
her
after
calling
for
a
taxi
they
drove
off
in
silence
susy
was
thinking
and
clarissa
but
dared
not
ask
vanderlyn
lit
a
cigarette
hummed
a
and
stared
out
of
the
window
suddenly
she
felt
his
hand
on
hers
susy
do
you
ever
see
her
see
ellie
he
nodded
without
turning
toward
her
not
often
sometimes
if
you
do
for
god
s
sake
tell
her
i
m
happy
happy
as
a
king
tell
her
you
could
see
for
yourself
that
i
was
his
voice
broke
in
a
little
gasp
i
i
ll
be
damned
if
if
she
shall
ever
be
unhappy
about
me
if
i
can
help
it
the
cigarette
dropped
from
his
fingers
and
with
a
sob
he
covered
his
face
oh
poor
nelson
poor
nelson
susy
breathed
while
their
cab
rattled
across
the
place
du
carrousel
and
over
the
bridge
he
continued
to
sit
beside
her
with
hidden
face
at
last
he
pulled
out
a
scented
handkerchief
rubbed
his
eyes
with
it
and
groped
for
another
cigarette
i
m
all
right
tell
her
that
will
you
susy
there
are
some
of
our
old
times
i
don
t
suppose
i
shall
ever
forget
but
they
make
me
feel
kindly
to
her
and
not
angry
i
didn
t
know
it
would
be
so
beforehand
but
it
is
and
now
the
thing
s
settled
i
m
as
right
as
a
trivet
and
you
can
tell
her
so
look
here
susy
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
as
the
taxi
drew
up
at
her
hotel
tell
her
i
understand
will
you
i
d
rather
like
her
to
know
that
i
ll
tell
her
nelson
she
promised
and
climbed
the
stairs
alone
to
her
dreary
room
susy
s
one
fear
was
that
strefford
when
he
returned
the
next
day
should
treat
their
talk
of
the
previous
evening
as
a
fit
of
nerves
to
be
jested
away
he
might
indeed
resent
her
behaviour
too
deeply
to
seek
to
see
her
at
once
but
his
easygoing
modern
attitude
toward
conduct
and
convictions
made
that
improbable
she
had
an
idea
that
what
he
had
most
minded
was
her
dropping
so
unceremoniously
out
of
the
embassy
dinner
but
after
all
why
should
she
see
him
again
she
had
had
enough
of
explanations
during
the
last
months
to
have
learned
how
seldom
they
explain
anything
if
the
other
person
did
not
understand
at
the
first
word
at
the
first
glance
even
subsequent
elucidations
served
only
to
deepen
the
obscurity
and
she
wanted
above
all
and
especially
since
her
hour
with
nelson
vanderlyn
to
keep
herself
free
aloof
to
retain
her
hold
on
her
precariously
recovered
self
she
sat
down
and
wrote
to
strefford
and
the
letter
was
only
a
little
less
painful
to
write
than
the
one
she
had
despatched
to
nick
it
was
not
that
her
own
feelings
were
in
any
like
measure
engaged
but
because
as
the
decision
to
give
up
strefford
affirmed
itself
she
remembered
only
his
kindness
his
forbearance
his
good
humour
and
all
the
other
qualities
she
had
always
liked
in
him
and
because
she
felt
ashamed
of
the
hesitations
which
must
cause
him
so
much
pain
and
humiliation
yes
humiliation
chiefly
she
knew
that
what
she
had
to
say
would
hurt
his
pride
in
whatever
way
she
framed
her
renunciation
and
her
pen
wavered
hating
its
task
then
she
remembered
vanderlyn
s
words
about
his
wife
there
are
some
of
our
old
times
i
don
t
suppose
i
shall
ever
forget
and
a
phrase
of
grace
fulmer
s
that
she
had
but
half
grasped
at
the
time
you
haven
t
been
married
long
enough
to
understand
how
trifling
such
things
seem
in
the
balance
of
one
s
here
were
two
people
who
had
penetrated
farther
than
she
into
the
labyrinth
of
the
wedded
state
and
struggled
through
some
of
its
thorniest
passages
and
yet
both
one
consciously
the
other
testified
to
the
mysterious
fact
which
was
already
dawning
on
her
that
the
influence
of
a
marriage
begun
in
mutual
understanding
is
too
deep
not
to
reassert
itself
even
in
the
moment
of
flight
and
denial
the
real
reason
is
that
you
re
not
nick
was
what
she
would
have
said
to
strefford
if
she
had
dared
to
set
down
the
bare
truth
and
she
knew
that
whatever
she
wrote
he
was
too
acute
not
to
read
that
into
it
he
ll
think
it
s
because
i
m
still
in
love
with
nick
and
perhaps
i
am
but
even
if
i
were
the
difference
doesn
t
seem
to
lie
there
after
all
but
deeper
in
things
we
ve
shared
that
seem
to
be
meant
to
outlast
love
or
to
change
it
into
something
if
she
could
have
hoped
to
make
strefford
understand
that
the
letter
would
have
been
easy
enough
to
write
but
she
knew
just
at
what
point
his
imagination
would
fail
in
what
obvious
and
superficial
inferences
it
would
rest
poor
streff
poor
me
she
thought
as
she
sealed
the
letter
after
she
had
despatched
it
a
sense
of
blankness
descended
on
her
she
had
succeeded
in
driving
from
her
mind
all
vain
hesitations
doubts
returns
upon
herself
her
healthy
system
naturally
rejected
them
but
they
left
a
queer
emptiness
in
which
her
thoughts
rattled
about
as
thoughts
might
she
supposed
in
the
first
moments
after
death
before
one
got
used
to
it
to
get
used
to
being
dead
that
seemed
to
be
her
immediate
business
and
she
felt
such
a
novice
at
it
felt
so
horribly
alive
how
had
those
others
learned
to
do
without
living
nelson
well
he
was
still
in
the
throes
and
probably
never
would
understand
or
be
able
to
communicate
the
lesson
when
he
had
mastered
it
but
grace
fulmer
she
suddenly
remembered
that
grace
was
in
paris
and
set
forth
to
find
her
xxiv
nick
lansing
had
walked
out
a
long
way
into
the
campagna
his
hours
were
seldom
his
own
for
both
and
hicks
were
becoming
more
and
more
addicted
to
sudden
and
somewhat
imperious
demands
upon
his
time
but
on
this
occasion
he
had
simply
slipped
away
after
luncheon
and
taking
the
tram
to
the
porta
salaria
had
wandered
on
thence
in
the
direction
of
the
ponte
nomentano
he
wanted
to
get
away
and
think
but
now
that
he
had
done
it
the
business
proved
as
unfruitful
as
everything
he
had
put
his
hand
to
since
he
had
left
venice
think
think
about
what
his
future
seemed
to
him
a
negligible
matter
since
he
had
received
two
months
earlier
the
few
lines
in
which
susy
had
asked
him
for
her
freedom
the
letter
had
been
a
shock
though
he
had
fancied
himself
so
prepared
for
it
yet
it
had
also
in
another
sense
been
a
relief
since
now
that
at
last
circumstances
compelled
him
to
write
to
her
they
also
told
him
what
to
say
and
he
had
said
it
as
briefly
and
simply
as
possible
telling
her
that
he
would
put
no
obstacle
in
the
way
of
her
release
that
he
held
himself
at
her
lawyer
s
disposal
to
answer
any
further
communication
and
that
he
would
never
forget
their
days
together
or
cease
to
bless
her
for
them
that
was
all
he
gave
his
roman
banker
s
address
and
waited
for
another
letter
but
none
came
probably
the
formalities
whatever
they
were
took
longer
than
he
had
supposed
and
being
in
no
haste
to
recover
his
own
liberty
he
did
not
try
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
delay
from
that
moment
however
he
considered
himself
virtually
free
and
ceased
by
the
same
token
to
take
any
interest
in
his
own
future
his
life
seemed
as
flat
as
a
convalescent
s
first
days
after
the
fever
has
dropped
the
only
thing
he
was
sure
of
was
that
he
was
not
going
to
remain
in
the
hickses
employ
when
they
left
rome
for
central
asia
he
had
no
intention
of
accompanying
them
the
part
of
buttles
successor
was
becoming
daily
more
intolerable
to
him
for
the
very
reasons
that
had
probably
made
it
most
gratifying
to
buttles
to
be
treated
by
and
hicks
as
a
paid
oracle
a
paraded
and
petted
piece
of
property
was
a
good
deal
more
distasteful
than
he
could
have
imagined
any
relation
with
these
kindly
people
could
be
and
since
their
aspirations
had
become
frankly
social
he
found
his
task
if
easier
yet
far
less
congenial
than
during
his
first
months
with
them
he
preferred
patiently
explaining
to
hicks
for
the
hundredth
time
that
sassanian
and
saracenic
were
not
interchangeable
terms
to
unravelling
for
her
the
genealogies
of
her
titled
guests
and
reminding
her
when
she
seated
her
that
dukes
ranked
higher
than
princes
no
the
job
was
decidedly
intolerable
and
he
would
have
to
look
out
for
another
means
of
earning
his
living
but
that
was
not
what
he
had
really
got
away
to
think
about
he
knew
he
should
never
starve
he
had
even
begun
to
believe
again
in
his
book
what
he
wanted
to
think
of
was
susy
or
rather
it
was
susy
that
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
on
whatever
train
of
thought
he
set
out
again
and
again
he
fancied
he
had
established
a
truce
with
the
past
had
come
to
terms
the
terms
of
defeat
and
failure
with
that
bright
enemy
called
happiness
and
in
truth
he
had
reached
the
point
of
definitely
knowing
that
he
could
never
return
to
the
kind
of
life
that
he
and
susy
had
embarked
on
it
had
been
the
tragedy
of
their
relation
that
loving
her
roused
in
him
ideals
she
could
never
satisfy
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
because
she
was
like
himself
amused
unprejudiced
and
disenchanted
and
he
could
not
go
on
loving
her
unless
she
ceased
to
be
all
these
things
from
that
circle
there
was
no
issue
and
in
it
he
desperately
revolved
if
he
had
not
heard
such
persistent
rumours
of
her
to
lord
altringham
he
might
have
tried
to
see
her
again
but
aware
of
the
danger
and
the
hopelessness
of
a
meeting
he
was
on
the
whole
glad
to
have
a
reason
for
avoiding
it
such
at
least
he
honestly
supposed
to
be
his
state
of
mind
until
he
found
himself
as
on
this
occasion
free
to
follow
out
his
thought
to
its
end
that
end
invariably
was
susy
not
the
bundle
of
qualities
and
defects
into
which
his
critical
spirit
had
tried
to
sort
her
out
but
the
soft
blur
of
identity
of
personality
of
eyes
hair
mouth
laugh
tricks
of
speech
and
gesture
that
were
all
so
solely
and
profoundly
her
own
and
yet
so
mysteriously
independent
of
what
she
might
do
say
think
in
crucial
circumstances
he
remembered
her
once
saying
to
him
after
all
you
were
right
when
you
wanted
me
to
be
your
mistress
and
the
indignant
stare
of
incredulity
with
which
he
had
answered
her
yet
in
these
hours
it
was
the
palpable
image
of
her
that
clung
closest
till
as
invariably
happened
his
vision
came
full
circle
and
feeling
her
on
his
breast
he
wanted
her
also
in
his
soul
well
such
loves
were
the
rarest
of
human
experiences
he
smiled
at
his
presumption
in
wanting
no
other
wearily
he
turned
and
tramped
homeward
through
the
winter
twilight
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
he
ran
across
the
prince
of
teutoburg
s
they
had
not
met
for
some
days
and
nick
had
a
vague
feeling
that
if
the
prince
s
matrimonial
designs
took
definite
shape
he
himself
was
not
likely
after
all
to
be
their
chosen
exponent
he
had
surprised
now
and
then
a
certain
distrustful
coldness
under
the
princess
mother
s
cordial
glance
and
had
concluded
that
she
perhaps
suspected
him
of
being
an
obstacle
to
her
son
s
aspirations
he
had
no
idea
of
playing
that
part
but
was
not
sorry
to
appear
to
for
he
was
sincerely
attached
to
coral
hicks
and
hoped
for
her
a
more
human
fate
than
that
of
becoming
prince
anastasius
s
consort
this
evening
however
he
was
struck
by
the
beaming
alacrity
of
the
s
greeting
whatever
cloud
had
hung
between
them
had
lifted
the
teutoburg
clan
for
one
reason
or
another
no
longer
feared
or
distrusted
him
the
change
was
conveyed
in
a
mere
a
brief
exchange
of
words
for
the
was
hastening
after
a
dowager
of
the
old
roman
world
whom
he
helped
into
a
large
coronetted
brougham
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
extracted
for
some
ceremonial
purpose
from
a
museum
of
historic
vehicles
and
in
an
instant
it
flashed
on
lansing
that
this
lady
had
been
the
person
chosen
to
lay
the
prince
s
offer
at
miss
hicks
s
feet
the
discovery
piqued
him
and
instead
of
making
straight
for
his
own
room
he
went
up
to
hicks
s
the
room
was
empty
but
traces
of
elaborate
tea
pervaded
it
and
an
immense
bouquet
of
stiff
roses
lay
on
the
centre
table
as
he
turned
away
eldorada
tooker
flushed
and
abruptly
entered
oh
lansing
we
were
looking
everywhere
for
looking
for
me
yes
coral
especially
she
wants
to
see
you
she
wants
you
to
come
to
her
own
she
led
him
across
the
and
down
the
passage
to
the
separate
suite
which
miss
hicks
inhabited
on
the
threshold
eldorada
gasped
out
emotionally
you
ll
find
her
looking
lovely
and
jerked
away
with
a
sob
as
he
entered
coral
hicks
was
never
lovely
but
she
certainly
looked
unusually
handsome
perhaps
it
was
the
long
dress
of
black
velvet
which
outlined
against
a
shaded
lamp
made
her
strong
build
seem
slenderer
or
perhaps
the
slight
flush
on
her
dusky
cheek
a
bloom
of
womanhood
hung
upon
her
which
she
made
no
effort
to
dissemble
indeed
it
was
one
of
her
originalities
that
she
always
gravely
and
courageously
revealed
the
utmost
of
whatever
mood
possessed
her
how
splendid
you
look
he
said
smiling
at
her
she
threw
her
head
back
and
gazed
him
straight
in
the
eyes
that
s
going
to
be
my
future
to
look
splendid
and
wear
a
crown
and
wear
a
crown
they
continued
to
consider
each
other
without
speaking
nick
s
heart
contracted
with
pity
and
perplexity
oh
coral
it
s
not
decided
she
scrutinized
him
for
a
last
penetrating
moment
then
she
looked
away
i
m
never
long
he
hesitated
choking
with
contradictory
impulses
and
afraid
to
formulate
any
lest
they
should
either
mislead
or
pain
her
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
he
questioned
lamely
and
instantly
perceived
his
blunder
she
sat
down
and
looked
up
at
him
under
brooding
lashes
had
he
ever
noticed
the
thickness
of
her
lashes
before
would
it
have
made
any
difference
if
i
had
told
you
any
difference
sit
down
by
me
she
commanded
i
want
to
talk
to
you
you
can
say
now
whatever
you
might
have
said
sooner
i
m
not
married
yet
i
m
still
you
haven
t
given
your
answer
it
doesn
t
matter
if
i
the
retort
frightened
him
with
the
glimpse
of
what
she
still
expected
of
him
and
what
he
was
still
so
unable
to
give
that
means
you
ve
said
yes
he
pursued
to
gain
time
yes
or
no
it
doesn
t
matter
i
had
to
say
something
what
i
want
is
your
at
the
eleventh
hour
or
the
she
paused
what
shall
i
do
she
questioned
with
a
sudden
accent
of
helplessness
he
looked
at
her
as
helplessly
he
could
not
say
ask
yourself
ask
your
her
next
word
would
sweep
away
such
frail
hypocrisies
her
what
shall
i
do
meant
what
are
you
going
to
do
and
he
knew
it
and
knew
that
she
knew
it
i
m
a
bad
person
to
give
any
one
matrimonial
advice
he
began
with
a
strained
smile
but
i
had
such
a
different
vision
for
what
kind
of
a
vision
she
was
merciless
merely
what
people
call
happiness
people
call
you
see
you
don
t
believe
in
it
yourself
well
neither
do
i
in
that
form
at
any
he
considered
i
believe
in
trying
for
it
even
if
the
trying
s
the
best
of
well
i
ve
tried
and
failed
and
i
m
and
i
never
was
young
i
suppose
i
haven
t
enough
she
drew
a
deep
breath
now
i
want
something
she
appeared
to
search
for
the
word
i
want
to
be
prominent
she
declared
prominent
she
reddened
swarthily
oh
you
smile
you
think
it
s
ridiculous
it
doesn
t
seem
worth
while
to
you
that
s
because
you
ve
always
had
all
those
things
but
i
haven
t
i
know
what
father
pushed
up
from
and
i
want
to
push
up
as
high
again
higher
no
i
haven
t
got
much
imagination
i
ve
always
liked
facts
and
i
find
i
shall
like
the
fact
of
being
a
princess
choosing
the
people
i
associate
with
and
being
up
above
all
these
european
grandees
that
father
and
mother
bow
down
to
though
they
think
they
despise
them
you
can
be
up
above
these
people
by
just
being
yourself
you
know
how
but
i
need
a
platform
a
father
and
mother
slaved
to
give
me
my
education
they
thought
education
was
the
important
thing
but
since
we
ve
all
three
of
us
got
mediocre
minds
it
has
just
landed
us
among
mediocre
people
don
t
you
suppose
i
see
through
all
the
sham
science
and
sham
art
and
sham
everything
we
re
surrounded
with
that
s
why
i
want
to
buy
a
place
at
the
very
top
where
i
shall
be
powerful
enough
to
get
about
me
the
people
i
want
the
big
people
the
right
people
and
to
help
them
i
want
to
promote
culture
like
those
renaissance
women
you
re
always
talking
about
i
want
to
do
it
for
apex
city
do
you
understand
and
for
father
and
mother
too
i
want
all
those
titles
carved
on
my
tombstone
they
re
facts
anyhow
don
t
laugh
at
me
she
broke
off
with
one
of
her
clumsy
smiles
and
moved
away
from
him
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
he
sat
looking
at
her
with
a
curious
feeling
of
admiration
her
harsh
positivism
was
like
a
tonic
to
his
disenchanted
mood
and
he
thought
what
a
pity
aloud
he
said
i
don
t
feel
like
laughing
at
you
you
re
a
great
then
i
shall
be
a
great
oh
but
you
might
have
been
something
so
much
greater
her
face
flamed
again
don
t
say
that
he
stood
up
involuntarily
and
drew
near
her
why
not
because
you
re
the
only
man
with
whom
i
can
imagine
the
other
kind
of
it
moved
him
moved
him
unexpectedly
he
got
as
far
as
saying
to
himself
good
god
if
she
were
not
so
hideously
rich
and
then
of
yielding
for
a
moment
to
the
persuasive
vision
of
all
that
he
and
she
might
do
with
those
very
riches
which
he
dreaded
after
all
there
was
nothing
mean
in
her
ideals
they
were
hard
and
material
in
keeping
with
her
primitive
and
massive
person
but
they
had
a
certain
grim
nobility
and
when
she
spoke
of
the
other
kind
of
greatness
he
knew
that
she
understood
what
she
was
talking
of
and
was
not
merely
saying
something
to
draw
him
on
to
get
him
to
commit
himself
there
was
not
a
drop
of
guile
in
her
except
that
which
her
very
honesty
distilled
the
other
kind
of
greatness
he
repeated
well
isn
t
that
what
you
said
happiness
was
i
wanted
to
be
happy
but
one
can
t
he
went
up
to
her
no
one
can
t
choose
and
how
can
anyone
give
you
happiness
who
hasn
t
got
it
himself
he
took
her
hands
feeling
how
large
muscular
and
voluntary
they
were
even
as
they
melted
in
his
palms
my
poor
coral

iii
xxv
in
the
persistent
drizzle
of
a
paris
winter
morning
susy
lansing
walked
back
alone
from
the
school
at
which
she
had
just
deposited
the
four
eldest
fulmers
to
the
little
house
in
passy
where
for
the
last
two
months
she
had
been
living
with
them
she
had
on
boots
an
old
waterproof
and
a
last
year
s
hat
but
none
of
these
facts
disturbed
her
though
she
took
no
particular
pride
in
them
the
truth
was
that
she
was
too
busy
to
think
much
about
them
since
she
had
assumed
the
charge
of
the
fulmer
children
in
the
absence
of
both
their
parents
in
italy
she
had
had
to
pass
through
such
an
arduous
apprenticeship
of
motherhood
that
every
moment
of
her
waking
hours
was
packed
with
things
to
do
at
once
and
other
things
to
remember
to
do
later
there
were
only
five
fulmers
but
at
times
they
were
like
an
army
with
banners
and
their
power
of
was
equalled
only
by
the
manner
in
which
they
could
dwindle
vanish
grow
mute
and
become
as
it
were
a
single
tumbled
brown
head
bent
over
a
book
in
some
corner
of
the
house
in
which
nobody
would
ever
have
thought
of
hunting
for
them
and
which
of
course
were
it
the
bonne
s
room
in
the
attic
or
the
subterranean
closet
where
the
trunks
were
kept
had
been
singled
out
by
them
for
that
very
reason
these
changes
from
ubiquity
to
invisibility
would
have
seemed
to
susy
a
few
months
earlier
one
of
the
most
maddening
of
many
characteristics
not
calculated
to
promote
repose
but
now
she
felt
differently
she
had
grown
interested
in
her
charges
and
the
search
for
a
clue
to
their
methods
whether
tribal
or
individual
was
as
exciting
to
her
as
the
development
of
a
detective
story
what
interested
her
most
in
the
whole
stirring
business
was
the
discovery
that
they
had
a
method
these
little
creatures
pitched
upward
into
experience
on
the
tossing
waves
of
their
parents
agitated
lives
had
managed
to
establish
a
system
of
junie
the
eldest
the
one
who
already
chose
her
mother
s
hats
and
tried
to
put
order
in
her
wardrobe
was
the
recognized
head
of
the
state
at
twelve
she
knew
lots
of
things
which
her
mother
had
never
thoroughly
learned
and
susy
her
temporary
mother
had
never
even
guessed
at
she
spoke
with
authority
on
all
vital
subjects
from
to
flannel
from
the
fair
sharing
of
stamps
or
marbles
to
the
number
of
helpings
of
or
jam
which
each
child
was
entitled
to
there
was
hardly
any
appeal
from
her
verdict
yet
each
of
her
subjects
revolved
in
his
or
her
own
orbit
of
independence
according
to
laws
which
junie
acknowledged
and
respected
and
the
interpreting
of
this
mysterious
charter
of
rights
and
privileges
had
not
been
without
difficulty
for
susy
besides
this
there
were
material
difficulties
to
deal
with
the
six
of
them
and
the
breathless
bonne
who
cooked
and
slaved
for
them
all
had
but
a
slim
budget
to
live
on
and
as
junie
remarked
you
d
have
thought
the
boys
ate
their
shoes
the
way
they
vanished
they
ate
certainly
a
great
deal
else
and
mostly
of
a
nourishing
and
expensive
kind
they
had
definite
views
about
the
amount
and
quality
of
their
food
and
were
capable
of
concerted
rebellion
when
susy
s
catering
fell
beneath
their
standard
all
this
made
her
life
a
hurried
and
harassing
business
but
never
what
she
had
most
feared
it
would
be
a
dull
or
depressing
one
it
was
not
she
owned
to
herself
that
the
society
of
the
fulmer
children
had
roused
in
her
any
abstract
passion
for
the
human
young
she
knew
had
known
since
nick
s
first
kiss
how
she
would
love
any
child
of
his
and
hers
and
she
had
cherished
poor
little
clarissa
vanderlyn
with
a
shrinking
and
wistful
solicitude
but
in
these
rough
young
fulmers
she
took
a
positive
delight
and
for
reasons
that
were
increasingly
clear
to
her
it
was
because
in
the
first
place
they
were
all
intelligent
and
because
their
intelligence
had
been
fed
only
on
things
worth
caring
for
however
inadequate
grace
fulmer
s
of
her
increasing
tribe
had
been
they
had
heard
in
her
company
nothing
trivial
or
dull
good
music
good
books
and
good
talk
had
been
their
daily
food
and
if
at
times
they
stamped
and
roared
and
crashed
about
like
children
unblessed
by
such
privileges
at
others
they
shone
with
the
light
of
poetry
and
spoke
with
the
voice
of
wisdom
that
had
been
susy
s
discovery
for
the
first
time
she
was
among
awakening
minds
which
had
been
wakened
only
to
beauty
from
their
cramped
and
uncomfortable
household
grace
and
nat
fulmer
had
managed
to
keep
out
mean
envies
vulgar
admirations
shabby
discontents
above
all
the
din
and
confusion
the
great
images
of
beauty
had
brooded
like
those
ancestral
figures
that
stood
apart
on
their
shelf
in
the
poorest
roman
households
no
the
task
she
had
undertaken
for
want
of
a
better
gave
susy
no
sense
of
a
missed
vocation
mothering
on
a
large
scale
would
never
she
perceived
be
her
job
rather
it
gave
her
in
odd
ways
the
sense
of
being
herself
mothered
of
taking
her
first
steps
in
the
life
of
immaterial
values
which
had
begun
to
seem
so
much
more
substantial
than
any
she
had
known
on
the
day
when
she
had
gone
to
grace
fulmer
for
counsel
and
comfort
she
had
little
guessed
that
they
would
come
to
her
in
this
form
she
had
found
her
friend
more
than
ever
distracted
and
yet
buoyant
riding
the
large
untidy
waves
of
her
life
with
the
splashed
ease
of
an
amphibian
grace
was
probably
the
only
person
among
susy
s
friends
who
could
have
understood
why
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
marry
altringham
but
at
the
moment
grace
was
too
much
absorbed
in
her
own
problems
to
pay
much
attention
to
her
friend
s
and
according
to
her
wont
she
immediately
unpacked
her
difficulties
nat
was
not
getting
what
she
had
hoped
out
of
his
european
opportunity
oh
she
was
enough
of
an
artist
herself
to
know
that
there
must
be
fallow
periods
that
the
impact
of
new
impressions
seldom
produced
immediate
results
she
had
allowed
for
all
that
but
her
past
experience
of
nat
s
moods
had
taught
her
to
know
just
when
he
was
assimilating
when
impressions
were
fructifying
in
him
and
now
they
were
not
and
he
knew
it
as
well
as
she
did
there
had
been
too
much
rushing
about
too
much
excitement
and
sterile
flattery
melrose
well
yes
for
a
while
the
trip
to
spain
had
been
a
no
doubt
grace
spoke
calmly
but
the
lines
of
her
face
sharpened
she
had
suffered
oh
horribly
at
his
going
to
spain
without
her
yet
she
couldn
t
for
the
children
s
sake
afford
to
miss
the
big
sum
that
ursula
gillow
had
given
her
for
her
fortnight
at
ruan
and
her
playing
had
struck
people
and
led
on
the
way
back
to
two
or
three
profitable
engagements
in
private
houses
in
london
fashionable
society
had
made
a
little
fuss
about
her
and
it
had
surprised
and
pleased
nat
and
given
her
a
new
importance
in
his
eyes
he
was
beginning
to
forget
that
i
wasn
t
only
a
and
it
s
been
a
good
thing
for
him
to
be
reminded
but
the
great
thing
is
that
with
what
i
ve
earned
he
and
i
can
go
off
to
southern
italy
and
sicily
for
three
months
you
know
i
know
how
to
manage
and
alone
with
me
nat
will
settle
down
to
work
to
observing
feeling
soaking
things
in
it
s
the
only
way
melrose
wants
to
take
him
to
pay
all
the
expenses
again
well
she
shan
t
i
ll
pay
her
worn
cheek
flushed
with
triumph
and
you
ll
see
what
wonders
will
come
of
it
only
there
s
the
problem
of
the
children
junie
quite
agrees
that
we
can
t
take
them
thereupon
she
had
unfolded
her
idea
if
susy
was
at
a
loose
end
and
hard
up
why
shouldn
t
she
take
charge
of
the
children
while
their
parents
were
in
italy
for
three
months
at
most
grace
could
promise
it
shouldn
t
be
longer
they
couldn
t
pay
her
much
of
course
but
at
least
she
would
be
lodged
and
fed
and
you
know
it
will
end
by
interesting
you
i
m
sure
it
will
the
mother
concluded
her
irrepressible
hopefulness
rising
even
to
this
height
while
susy
stood
before
her
with
a
hesitating
smile
take
care
of
five
fulmers
for
three
months
the
prospect
cowed
her
if
there
had
been
only
junie
and
geordie
the
oldest
and
youngest
of
the
band
she
might
have
felt
less
hesitation
but
there
was
nat
the
second
in
age
whose
had
driven
her
and
nick
out
to
the
on
their
fatal
day
at
the
fulmers
and
there
were
the
twins
jack
and
peggy
of
whom
she
had
kept
memories
almost
equally
disquieting
to
rule
this
uproarious
tribe
would
be
a
sterner
business
than
trying
to
beguile
clarissa
vanderlyn
s
ladylike
leisure
and
she
would
have
refused
on
the
spot
as
she
had
refused
once
before
if
the
only
possible
alternatives
had
not
come
to
seem
so
much
less
bearable
and
if
junie
called
in
for
advice
and
standing
there
small
plain
and
competent
had
not
said
in
her
quiet
voice
oh
yes
i
m
sure
lansing
and
i
can
manage
while
you
re
away
especially
if
she
reads
aloud
reads
aloud
well
the
stipulation
had
enchanted
susy
she
had
never
before
known
children
who
cared
to
be
read
aloud
to
she
remembered
with
a
shiver
her
attempts
to
interest
clarissa
in
anything
but
gossip
and
the
fashions
and
the
tone
in
which
the
child
had
said
showing
strefford
s
trinket
to
her
father
because
i
said
i
d
rather
have
it
than
a
and
here
were
children
who
consented
to
be
left
for
three
months
by
their
parents
but
on
condition
that
a
good
reader
was
provided
for
them
very
well
i
will
but
what
shall
i
be
expected
to
read
to
you
she
had
gaily
questioned
and
junie
had
answered
after
one
of
her
sober
pauses
of
reflection
the
little
ones
like
nearly
everything
but
nat
and
i
want
poetry
particularly
because
if
we
read
it
to
ourselves
we
so
often
pronounce
the
puzzling
words
wrong
and
then
it
sounds
so
oh
i
hope
i
shall
pronounce
them
right
susy
murmured
stricken
with
and
humility
apparently
she
did
for
her
reading
was
a
success
and
even
the
twins
and
geordie
once
they
had
grown
used
to
her
seemed
to
prefer
a
ringing
page
of
henry
v
or
the
fairy
scenes
from
the
midsummer
night
s
dream
to
their
own
more
specialized
literature
though
that
had
also
at
times
to
be
provided
there
were
in
fact
no
lulls
in
her
life
with
the
fulmers
but
its
commotions
seemed
to
susy
less
meaningless
and
therefore
less
fatiguing
than
those
that
punctuated
the
existence
of
people
like
altringham
ursula
gillow
ellie
vanderlyn
and
their
train
and
the
noisy
uncomfortable
little
house
at
passy
was
beginning
to
greet
her
with
the
eyes
of
home
when
she
returned
there
after
her
tramps
to
and
from
the
children
s
classes
at
any
rate
she
had
the
sense
of
doing
something
useful
and
even
necessary
and
of
earning
her
own
keep
though
on
so
modest
a
scale
and
when
the
children
were
in
their
quiet
mood
and
demanded
books
or
music
or
even
on
one
occasion
at
the
surprising
junie
s
instigation
a
collective
visit
to
the
louvre
where
they
recognized
the
most
unlikely
pictures
and
the
two
elders
emitted
startling
technical
judgments
and
called
their
companion
s
attention
to
details
she
had
not
observed
on
these
occasions
susy
had
a
surprised
sense
of
being
drawn
back
into
her
brief
life
with
nick
or
even
still
farther
and
deeper
into
those
visions
of
nick
s
own
childhood
on
which
the
trivial
later
years
had
heaped
their
dust
it
was
curious
to
think
that
if
he
and
she
had
remained
together
and
she
had
had
a
child
the
vision
used
to
come
to
her
in
her
sleepless
hours
when
she
looked
at
little
geordie
in
his
cot
by
her
bed
their
life
together
might
have
been
very
much
like
the
life
she
was
now
leading
a
small
obscure
business
to
the
outer
world
but
to
themselves
how
wide
and
deep
and
crowded
she
could
not
bear
at
that
moment
the
thought
of
giving
up
this
mystic
relation
to
the
life
she
had
missed
in
spite
of
the
hurry
and
fatigue
of
her
days
the
shabbiness
and
discomfort
of
everything
and
the
hours
when
the
children
were
as
horrid
as
any
other
children
and
turned
a
conspiracy
of
hostile
faces
to
all
her
appeals
in
spite
of
all
this
she
did
not
want
to
give
them
up
and
had
decided
when
their
parents
returned
to
ask
to
go
back
to
america
with
them
perhaps
if
nat
s
success
continued
and
grace
was
able
to
work
at
her
music
they
would
need
a
kind
of
at
any
rate
she
could
picture
no
future
less
distasteful
she
had
not
sent
to
spearman
nick
s
answer
to
her
letter
in
the
interval
between
writing
to
him
and
receiving
his
reply
she
had
broken
with
strefford
she
had
therefore
no
object
in
seeking
her
freedom
if
nick
wanted
his
he
knew
he
had
only
to
ask
for
it
and
his
silence
as
the
weeks
passed
woke
a
faint
hope
in
her
the
hope
flamed
high
when
she
read
one
day
in
the
newspapers
a
vague
but
evidently
inspired
allusion
to
the
possibility
of
an
alliance
between
his
serene
highness
the
reigning
prince
of
and
miss
coral
hicks
of
apex
city
it
sank
to
ashes
when
a
few
days
later
her
eye
lit
on
a
paragraph
wherein
and
mortimer
hicks
requested
to
state
that
there
was
no
truth
in
the
report
on
the
foundation
of
these
two
statements
susy
raised
one
of
hope
after
another
feverish
edifices
demolished
or
rebuilt
by
every
chance
hint
from
the
outer
world
wherein
nick
s
name
figured
with
the
hickses
and
still
as
the
days
passed
and
she
heard
nothing
either
from
him
or
from
her
lawyer
her
flag
continued
to
fly
from
the
quaking
structures
apart
from
the
custody
of
the
children
there
was
indeed
little
to
distract
her
mind
from
these
persistent
broodings
she
winced
sometimes
at
the
thought
of
the
ease
with
which
her
fashionable
friends
had
let
her
drop
out
of
sight
in
the
perpetual
purposeless
rush
of
their
days
the
feverish
making
of
winter
plans
hurrying
off
to
the
riviera
or
moritz
egypt
or
new
york
there
was
no
time
to
hunt
up
the
vanished
or
to
wait
for
the
laggard
had
they
learned
that
she
had
broken
her
engagement
how
she
hated
the
word
to
strefford
and
had
the
fact
gone
about
that
she
was
once
more
only
a
poor
to
be
taken
up
when
it
was
convenient
and
ignored
in
the
intervals
she
did
not
know
though
she
fancied
strefford
s
pride
would
prevent
his
revealing
to
any
one
what
had
passed
between
them
for
several
days
after
her
abrupt
flight
he
had
made
no
sign
and
though
she
longed
to
write
and
ask
his
forgiveness
she
could
not
find
the
words
finally
it
was
he
who
wrote
a
short
note
from
altringham
typical
of
all
that
was
best
in
the
old
strefford
he
had
gone
down
to
altringham
he
told
her
to
think
quietly
over
their
last
talk
and
try
to
understand
what
she
had
been
driving
at
he
had
to
own
that
he
couldn
t
but
that
he
supposed
was
the
very
head
and
front
of
his
offending
whatever
he
had
done
to
displease
her
he
was
sorry
for
but
he
asked
in
view
of
his
invincible
ignorance
to
be
allowed
not
to
regard
his
offence
as
a
cause
for
a
final
break
the
possibility
of
that
he
found
would
make
him
even
more
unhappy
than
he
had
foreseen
as
she
knew
his
own
happiness
had
always
been
his
first
object
in
life
and
he
therefore
begged
her
to
suspend
her
decision
a
little
longer
he
expected
to
be
in
paris
within
another
two
months
and
before
arriving
he
would
write
again
and
ask
her
to
see
him
the
letter
moved
her
but
did
not
make
her
waver
she
simply
wrote
that
she
was
touched
by
his
kindness
and
would
willingly
see
him
if
he
came
to
paris
later
though
she
was
bound
to
tell
him
that
she
had
not
yet
changed
her
mind
and
did
not
believe
it
would
promote
his
happiness
to
have
her
try
to
do
so
he
did
not
reply
to
this
and
there
was
nothing
further
to
keep
her
thoughts
from
revolving
endlessly
about
her
inmost
hopes
and
fears
on
the
rainy
afternoon
in
question
tramping
home
from
the
cours
to
which
she
was
to
return
at
six
she
had
said
to
herself
that
it
was
two
months
that
very
day
since
nick
had
known
she
was
ready
to
release
him
and
that
after
such
a
delay
he
was
not
likely
to
take
any
further
steps
the
thought
filled
her
with
a
vague
ecstasy
she
had
had
to
fix
an
arbitrary
date
as
the
term
of
her
anguish
and
she
had
fixed
that
one
and
behold
she
was
justified
for
what
could
his
silence
mean
but
that
he
too
on
the
lay
a
typed
envelope
with
the
paris
she
opened
it
carelessly
and
saw
that
the
bore
spearman
s
office
address
the
words
beneath
spun
round
before
her
eyes
has
notified
us
that
he
is
at
your
disposal
carry
out
your
wishes
arriving
in
paris
fix
an
appointment
with
his
lawyers
nick
it
was
nick
the
words
were
talking
of
it
was
the
fact
of
nick
s
return
to
paris
that
was
being
described
in
those
preposterous
terms
she
sank
down
on
the
bench
beside
the
dripping
and
stared
vacantly
before
her
it
had
fallen
at
last
this
blow
in
which
she
now
saw
that
she
had
never
really
believed
and
yet
she
had
imagined
she
was
prepared
for
it
had
expected
it
was
already
planning
her
future
life
in
view
of
it
an
effaced
impersonal
life
in
the
service
of
somebody
else
s
children
when
in
reality
under
that
thin
surface
of
abnegation
and
acceptance
all
the
old
hopes
had
been
smouldering
in
their
ashes
what
was
the
use
of
any
any
philosophy
any
experience
if
the
lawless
self
underneath
could
in
an
instant
consume
them
like
tinder
she
tried
to
collect
herself
to
understand
what
had
happened
nick
was
coming
to
paris
coming
not
to
see
her
but
to
consult
his
lawyer
it
meant
of
course
that
he
had
definitely
resolved
to
claim
his
freedom
and
that
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
this
final
step
after
more
than
six
months
of
inaction
and
seeming
indifference
it
could
be
only
because
something
unforeseen
and
decisive
had
happened
to
him
feverishly
she
put
together
again
the
stray
scraps
of
gossip
and
the
newspaper
paragraphs
that
had
reached
her
in
the
last
months
it
was
evident
that
miss
hicks
s
projected
marriage
with
the
prince
of
had
been
broken
off
at
the
last
moment
and
broken
off
because
she
intended
to
marry
nick
the
announcement
of
his
arrival
in
paris
and
the
publication
of
and
hicks
s
formal
denial
of
their
daughter
s
betrothal
coincided
too
closely
to
admit
of
any
other
inference
susy
tried
to
grasp
the
reality
of
these
assembled
facts
to
picture
to
herself
their
actual
tangible
results
she
thought
of
coral
hicks
bearing
the
name
of
nick
lansing
her
name
susy
s
own
and
entering
with
nick
in
her
wake
gaily
welcomed
by
the
very
people
who
a
few
months
before
had
welcomed
susy
with
the
same
warmth
in
spite
of
nick
s
growing
dislike
of
society
and
coral
s
attitude
of
intellectual
superiority
their
wealth
would
fatally
draw
them
back
into
the
world
to
which
nick
was
attached
by
all
his
habits
and
associations
and
no
doubt
it
would
amuse
him
to
that
world
as
a
dispenser
of
hospitality
to
play
the
part
of
host
where
he
had
so
long
been
a
guest
just
as
susy
had
once
fancied
it
would
amuse
her
to
it
as
lady
altringham
but
try
as
she
would
now
that
the
reality
was
so
close
on
her
she
could
not
visualize
it
or
relate
it
to
herself
the
mere
juxtaposition
of
the
two
names
coral
nick
which
in
old
times
she
had
so
often
laughingly
coupled
now
produced
a
blur
in
her
brain
she
continued
to
sit
helplessly
beside
the
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
the
appearance
of
the
bonne
aroused
her
her
youngest
charge
geordie
had
been
feverish
for
a
day
or
two
he
was
better
but
still
confined
to
the
nursery
and
he
had
heard
susy
unlock
the
and
could
not
imagine
why
she
had
not
come
straight
up
to
him
he
now
began
to
manifest
his
indignation
in
a
series
of
racking
howls
and
susy
shaken
out
of
her
trance
dropped
her
cloak
and
umbrella
and
hurried
up
oh
that
child
she
groaned
under
the
fulmer
roof
there
was
little
time
or
space
for
the
indulgence
of
private
sorrows
from
morning
till
night
there
was
always
some
immediate
practical
demand
on
one
s
attention
and
susy
was
beginning
to
see
how
in
contracted
households
children
may
play
a
part
less
romantic
but
not
less
useful
than
that
assigned
to
them
in
fiction
through
the
mere
fact
of
giving
their
parents
no
leisure
to
dwell
on
irremediable
grievances
though
her
own
apprenticeship
to
family
life
had
been
so
short
she
had
already
acquired
the
knack
of
rapid
mental
readjustment
and
as
she
hurried
up
to
the
nursery
her
private
cares
were
dispelled
by
a
dozen
problems
of
temperature
diet
and
medicine
such
readjustment
was
of
course
only
momentary
yet
each
time
it
happened
it
seemed
to
give
her
more
firmness
and
flexibility
of
temper
what
a
child
i
was
myself
six
months
ago
she
thought
wondering
that
nick
s
influence
and
the
tragedy
of
their
parting
should
have
done
less
to
mature
and
steady
her
than
these
few
weeks
in
a
house
full
of
children
pacifying
geordie
was
not
easy
for
he
had
long
since
learned
to
use
his
grievances
as
a
pretext
for
keeping
the
offender
at
his
beck
with
a
continuous
supply
of
stories
songs
and
games
you
d
better
be
careful
never
to
put
yourself
in
the
wrong
with
geordie
the
astute
junie
had
warned
susy
at
the
outset
because
he
s
got
such
a
memory
and
he
won
t
make
it
up
with
you
till
you
ve
told
him
every
he
s
ever
heard
but
on
this
occasion
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
geordie
s
indignation
melted
she
was
still
in
the
doorway
compunctious
abject
and
racking
her
dazed
brain
for
his
favourite
stories
when
she
saw
by
the
smoothing
out
of
his
mouth
and
the
sudden
serenity
of
his
eyes
that
he
was
going
to
give
her
the
delicious
but
not
wholly
reassuring
shock
of
being
a
good
boy
thoughtfully
he
examined
her
face
as
she
knelt
down
beside
the
cot
then
he
poked
out
a
finger
and
pressed
it
on
her
tearful
cheek
poor
susy
got
a
pain
too
he
said
putting
his
arms
about
her
and
as
she
hugged
him
close
he
added
philosophically
tell
geordie
a
new
story
darling
and
you
ll
forget
all
about
xxvi
nick
lansing
arrived
in
paris
two
days
after
his
lawyer
had
announced
his
coming
to
spearman
he
had
left
rome
with
the
definite
purpose
of
freeing
himself
and
susy
and
though
he
was
not
pledged
to
coral
hicks
he
had
not
concealed
from
her
the
object
of
his
journey
in
vain
had
he
tried
to
rouse
in
himself
any
sense
of
interest
in
his
own
future
beyond
the
need
of
reaching
a
definite
point
in
his
relation
to
susy
his
imagination
could
not
travel
but
he
had
been
moved
by
coral
s
confession
and
his
reason
told
him
that
he
and
she
would
probably
be
happy
together
with
the
temperate
happiness
based
on
a
community
of
tastes
and
an
enlargement
of
opportunities
he
meant
on
his
return
to
rome
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
and
he
knew
that
she
knew
it
indeed
if
he
had
not
spoken
before
leaving
it
was
with
no
idea
of
evading
his
fate
or
keeping
her
longer
in
suspense
but
simply
because
of
the
strange
apathy
that
had
fallen
on
him
since
he
had
received
susy
s
letter
in
his
incessant
he
dressed
up
this
apathy
as
a
discretion
which
forbade
his
engaging
coral
s
future
till
his
own
was
assured
but
in
truth
he
knew
that
coral
s
future
was
already
engaged
and
his
with
it
in
rome
the
fact
had
seemed
natural
and
even
inevitable
in
paris
it
instantly
became
the
thinnest
of
unrealities
not
because
paris
was
not
rome
nor
because
it
was
paris
but
because
hidden
away
somewhere
in
that
vast
unheeding
labyrinth
was
the
part
of
himself
that
was
susy
for
weeks
for
months
past
his
mind
had
been
saturated
with
susy
she
had
never
seemed
more
insistently
near
him
than
as
their
separation
lengthened
and
the
chance
of
reunion
became
less
probable
it
was
as
if
a
sickness
long
smouldering
in
him
had
broken
out
and
become
acute
enveloping
him
in
the
of
his
memories
there
were
moments
when
to
his
memory
their
actual
embraces
seemed
perfunctory
accidental
compared
with
this
deep
deliberate
imprint
of
her
soul
on
his
yet
now
it
had
become
suddenly
different
now
that
he
was
in
the
same
place
with
her
and
might
at
any
moment
run
across
her
meet
her
eyes
hear
her
voice
avoid
her
hand
now
that
penetrating
ghost
of
her
with
which
he
had
been
living
was
sucked
back
into
the
shadows
and
he
seemed
for
the
first
time
since
their
parting
to
be
again
in
her
actual
presence
he
woke
to
the
fact
on
the
morning
of
his
arrival
staring
down
from
his
hotel
window
on
a
street
she
would
perhaps
walk
through
that
very
day
and
over
a
limitless
huddle
of
roofs
one
of
which
covered
her
at
that
hour
the
abruptness
of
the
transition
startled
him
he
had
not
known
that
her
mere
geographical
nearness
would
take
him
by
the
throat
in
that
way
what
would
it
be
then
if
she
were
to
walk
into
the
room
thank
heaven
that
need
never
happen
he
was
sufficiently
informed
as
to
french
divorce
proceedings
to
know
that
they
would
not
necessitate
a
confrontation
with
his
wife
and
with
ordinary
luck
and
some
precautions
he
might
escape
even
a
distant
glimpse
of
her
he
did
not
mean
to
remain
in
paris
more
than
a
few
days
and
during
that
time
it
would
be
easy
knowing
as
he
did
her
tastes
and
altringham
s
to
avoid
the
places
where
she
was
likely
to
be
met
he
did
not
know
where
she
was
living
but
imagined
her
to
be
staying
with
melrose
or
some
other
rich
friend
or
else
lodged
in
prospective
affluence
at
the
nouveau
luxe
or
in
a
pretty
flat
of
her
own
trust
susy
ah
the
pang
of
it
to
manage
his
first
visit
was
to
his
lawyer
s
and
as
he
walked
through
the
familiar
streets
each
approaching
face
each
distant
figure
seemed
hers
the
obsession
was
intolerable
it
would
not
last
of
course
but
meanwhile
he
had
the
exposed
sense
of
a
fugitive
in
a
nightmare
who
feels
himself
the
only
creature
visible
in
a
ghostly
and
besetting
multitude
the
eye
of
the
metropolis
seemed
fixed
on
him
in
an
immense
unblinking
stare
at
the
lawyer
s
he
was
told
that
as
a
first
step
to
freedom
he
must
secure
a
domicile
in
paris
he
had
of
course
known
of
this
necessity
he
had
seen
too
many
friends
through
the
divorce
court
in
one
country
or
another
not
to
be
fairly
familiar
with
the
procedure
but
the
fact
presented
a
different
aspect
as
soon
as
he
tried
to
relate
it
to
himself
and
susy
it
was
as
though
susy
s
personality
were
a
medium
through
which
events
still
took
on
a
transfiguring
colour
he
found
the
domicile
that
very
day
a
tawdrily
furnished
obviously
destined
to
far
different
uses
and
as
he
sat
there
after
the
concierge
had
discreetly
withdrawn
with
the
first
quarter
s
payment
in
her
pocket
and
stared
about
him
at
the
vulgar
plushy
place
he
burst
out
laughing
at
what
it
was
about
to
figure
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
a
home
and
a
home
desecrated
by
his
own
act
the
home
in
which
he
and
susy
had
reared
their
precarious
bliss
and
seen
it
crumble
at
the
brutal
touch
of
his
unfaithfulness
and
his
cruelty
for
he
had
been
told
that
he
must
be
cruel
to
her
as
well
as
unfaithful
he
looked
at
the
walls
hung
with
sentimental
photogravures
at
the
shiny
bronze
nudes
the
and
the
bedizened
bed
and
once
more
the
unreality
the
impossibility
of
all
that
was
happening
to
him
entered
like
a
drug
into
his
veins
to
rouse
himself
he
stood
up
turned
the
key
on
the
hideous
place
and
returned
to
his
lawyer
s
he
knew
that
in
the
hard
dry
atmosphere
of
the
office
the
act
of
giving
the
address
of
the
flat
would
restore
some
kind
of
reality
to
the
phantasmal
transaction
and
with
wonder
he
watched
the
lawyer
as
a
matter
of
course
pencil
the
street
and
the
number
on
one
of
the
papers
enclosed
in
a
folder
on
which
his
own
name
was
elaborately
engrossed
as
he
took
leave
it
occurred
to
him
to
ask
where
susy
was
living
at
least
he
imagined
that
it
had
just
occurred
to
him
and
that
he
was
making
the
enquiry
merely
as
a
measure
of
precaution
in
order
to
know
what
quarter
of
paris
to
avoid
but
in
reality
the
question
had
been
on
his
lips
since
he
had
first
entered
the
office
and
lurking
in
his
mind
since
he
had
emerged
from
the
railway
station
that
morning
the
fact
of
not
knowing
where
she
lived
made
the
whole
of
paris
a
meaningless
unintelligible
place
as
useless
to
him
as
the
face
of
a
huge
clock
that
has
lost
its
hour
hand
the
address
in
passy
surprised
him
he
had
imagined
that
she
would
be
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
champs
elysees
or
the
place
de
l
etoile
but
probably
either
melrose
or
ellie
vanderlyn
had
taken
a
house
at
passy
well
it
was
something
of
a
relief
to
know
that
she
was
so
far
off
no
business
called
him
to
that
almost
suburban
region
beyond
the
trocadero
and
there
was
much
less
chance
of
meeting
her
than
if
she
had
been
in
the
centre
of
paris
all
day
he
wandered
avoiding
the
fashionable
quarters
the
streets
in
which
private
motors
glittered
five
deep
and
furred
and
feathered
silhouettes
glided
from
them
into
and
jewellers
shops
in
some
such
scenes
susy
was
no
doubt
figuring
slenderer
finer
vivider
than
the
other
images
of
clay
but
imitating
their
gestures
chattering
their
jargon
winding
her
hand
among
the
same
pearls
and
sables
he
struck
away
across
the
seine
along
the
quays
to
the
cite
the
of
old
paris
the
great
grey
vaults
of
eustache
the
swarming
streets
of
the
marais
he
gazed
at
monuments
dawdled
before
sat
in
squares
and
on
quays
watching
people
bargain
argue
philander
quarrel
stroll
past
in
linked
bands
beggars
whine
on
the
bridges
derelicts
doze
in
the
pale
winter
sun
mothers
in
mourning
hasten
by
taking
children
to
school
and
beat
their
weary
rounds
before
the
cafes
the
day
drifted
on
toward
evening
he
began
to
grow
afraid
of
his
solitude
and
to
think
of
dining
at
the
nouveau
luxe
or
some
other
fashionable
restaurant
where
he
would
be
fairly
sure
to
meet
acquaintances
and
be
carried
off
to
a
theatre
a
boite
or
a
anything
anything
now
to
get
away
from
the
maddening
round
of
his
thoughts
he
felt
the
same
blank
fear
of
solitude
as
months
ago
in
genoa
even
if
he
were
to
run
across
susy
and
altringham
what
of
it
better
get
the
job
over
people
had
long
since
ceased
to
take
on
tragedy
airs
about
divorce
dividing
couples
dined
together
to
the
last
and
met
afterward
in
each
other
s
houses
happy
in
the
consciousness
that
their
respective
remarriages
had
provided
two
new
centres
of
entertainment
yet
most
of
the
couples
who
took
their
so
philosophically
had
doubtless
had
their
hour
of
enchantment
of
belief
in
the
immortality
of
loving
whereas
he
and
susy
had
simply
and
frankly
entered
into
a
business
contract
for
their
mutual
advantage
the
fact
gave
the
last
touch
of
incongruity
to
his
agonies
and
exaltations
and
made
him
appear
to
himself
as
grotesque
and
superannuated
as
the
hero
of
a
romantic
novel
he
stood
up
from
a
bench
on
which
he
had
been
lounging
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
and
hailed
a
taxi
dusk
had
fallen
and
he
meant
to
go
back
to
his
hotel
take
a
rest
and
then
go
out
to
dine
but
instead
he
threw
susy
s
address
to
the
driver
and
settled
down
in
the
cab
resting
both
hands
on
the
knob
of
his
umbrella
and
staring
straight
ahead
of
him
as
if
he
were
accomplishing
some
tiresome
duty
that
had
to
be
got
through
with
before
he
could
turn
his
mind
to
more
important
things
it
s
the
easiest
way
he
heard
himself
say
at
the
her
he
stopped
the
cab
and
stood
motionless
while
it
rattled
away
it
was
a
short
vague
street
much
farther
off
than
he
had
expected
and
fading
away
at
the
farther
end
in
a
dusky
blur
of
hoardings
overhung
by
trees
a
thin
rain
was
beginning
to
fall
and
it
was
already
night
in
this
inadequately
lit
suburban
quarter
lansing
walked
down
the
empty
street
the
houses
stood
a
few
yards
apart
with
shrubs
between
and
gates
and
railings
dividing
them
from
the
pavement
he
could
not
at
first
distinguish
their
numbers
but
presently
coming
abreast
of
a
he
discovered
that
the
small
shabby
facade
it
illuminated
was
precisely
the
one
he
sought
the
discovery
surprised
him
he
had
imagined
that
as
frequently
happened
in
the
outlying
quarters
of
passy
and
la
muette
the
mean
street
would
lead
to
a
stately
private
hotel
built
upon
some
bowery
fragment
of
an
old
it
was
the
latest
whim
of
the
wealthy
to
establish
themselves
on
these
outskirts
of
paris
where
there
was
still
space
for
verdure
and
he
had
pictured
susy
behind
some
pillared
with
lights
pouring
across
glossy
turf
to
sculptured
gateposts
instead
he
saw
a
house
huddled
among
neighbours
of
its
kind
with
the
family
wash
fluttering
between
meagre
bushes
the
beat
ironically
on
its
front
which
had
the
worn
look
of
a
tired
s
face
and
lansing
as
he
leaned
against
the
opposite
railing
vainly
tried
to
fit
his
vision
of
susy
into
so
humble
a
setting
the
probable
explanation
was
that
his
lawyer
had
given
him
the
wrong
address
not
only
the
wrong
number
but
the
wrong
street
he
pulled
out
the
slip
of
paper
and
was
crossing
over
to
decipher
it
under
the
lamp
when
an
appeared
out
of
the
obscurity
and
approached
the
house
nick
drew
back
and
the
boy
unlatching
the
gate
ran
up
the
steps
and
gave
the
bell
a
pull
almost
immediately
the
door
opened
and
there
stood
susy
the
light
full
upon
her
and
upon
a
child
against
her
shoulder
the
space
behind
them
was
dark
or
so
dimly
lit
that
it
formed
a
black
background
to
her
vivid
figure
she
looked
at
the
without
surprise
took
his
parcel
and
after
he
had
turned
away
lingered
a
moment
in
the
door
glancing
down
the
empty
street
that
moment
to
her
watcher
seemed
quicker
than
a
flash
yet
as
long
as
a
there
she
was
a
stone
s
throw
away
but
utterly
unconscious
of
his
presence
his
susy
the
old
susy
and
yet
a
new
susy
curiously
transformed
transfigured
almost
by
the
new
attitude
in
which
he
beheld
her
in
the
first
shock
of
the
vision
he
forgot
his
surprise
at
her
being
in
such
a
place
forgot
to
wonder
whose
house
she
was
in
or
whose
was
the
sleepy
child
in
her
arms
for
an
instant
she
stood
out
from
the
blackness
behind
her
and
through
the
veil
of
the
winter
night
a
thing
apart
an
unconditioned
vision
the
eternal
image
of
the
woman
and
the
child
and
in
that
instant
everything
within
him
was
changed
and
renewed
his
eyes
were
still
absorbing
her
finding
again
the
familiar
curves
of
her
light
body
noting
the
thinness
of
the
lifted
arm
that
upheld
the
little
boy
the
droop
of
the
shoulder
he
weighed
on
the
brooding
way
in
which
her
cheek
leaned
to
his
even
while
she
looked
away
then
she
drew
back
the
door
closed
and
the
again
shone
on
blankness
but
she
s
mine
nick
cried
in
a
fierce
triumph
of
recovery
his
eyes
were
so
full
of
her
that
he
shut
them
to
hold
in
the
crowding
vision
it
remained
with
him
at
first
as
a
complete
picture
then
gradually
it
broke
up
into
its
component
parts
the
child
vanished
the
strange
house
vanished
and
susy
alone
stood
before
him
his
own
susy
only
his
susy
yet
changed
worn
tempered
older
even
with
sharper
shadows
under
the
the
brows
drawn
the
joint
of
the
slim
wrist
more
prominent
it
was
not
thus
that
his
memory
had
evoked
her
and
he
recalled
with
a
remorseful
pang
the
fact
that
something
in
her
look
her
dress
her
tired
and
drooping
attitude
suggested
poverty
dependence
seemed
to
make
her
after
all
a
part
of
the
shabby
house
in
which
at
first
sight
her
presence
had
seemed
so
incongruous
but
she
looks
poor
he
thought
his
heart
tightening
and
instantly
it
occurred
to
him
that
these
must
be
the
fulmer
children
whom
she
was
living
with
while
their
parents
travelled
in
italy
rumours
of
nat
fulmer
s
sudden
ascension
had
reached
him
and
he
had
heard
that
the
couple
had
lately
been
seen
in
naples
and
palermo
no
one
had
mentioned
susy
s
name
in
connection
with
them
and
he
could
hardly
tell
why
he
had
arrived
at
this
conclusion
except
perhaps
because
it
seemed
natural
that
if
susy
were
in
trouble
she
should
turn
to
her
old
friend
grace
but
why
in
trouble
what
trouble
what
could
have
happened
to
check
her
triumphant
career
that
s
what
i
mean
to
find
out
he
exclaimed
his
heart
was
beating
with
a
tumult
of
new
hopes
and
old
memories
the
sight
of
his
wife
so
remote
in
mien
and
manner
from
the
world
in
which
he
had
imagined
her
to
be
changed
in
a
flash
his
own
relation
to
life
and
flung
a
mist
of
unreality
over
all
that
he
had
been
trying
to
think
most
solid
and
tangible
nothing
now
was
substantial
to
him
but
the
stones
of
the
street
in
which
he
stood
the
front
of
the
house
which
hid
her
the
he
already
felt
in
his
grasp
he
started
forward
and
was
halfway
to
the
threshold
when
a
private
motor
turned
the
corner
the
twin
glitter
of
its
lamps
carpeting
the
wet
street
with
gold
to
susy
s
door
lansing
drew
back
into
the
shadow
as
the
motor
swept
up
to
the
house
a
man
jumped
out
and
the
light
fell
on
strefford
s
shambling
figure
its
lazy
disjointed
movements
so
unmistakably
the
same
under
his
fur
coat
and
in
the
new
setting
of
prosperity
lansing
stood
motionless
staring
at
the
door
strefford
rang
and
waited
would
susy
appear
again
perhaps
she
had
done
so
before
only
because
she
had
been
on
the
watch
but
no
after
a
slight
delay
a
bonne
appeared
the
breathless
of
a
busy
household
and
at
once
effaced
herself
letting
the
visitor
in
lansing
was
sure
that
not
a
word
passed
between
the
two
of
enquiry
on
lord
altringham
s
part
or
of
acquiescence
on
the
servant
s
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
expected
the
door
closed
on
him
and
a
light
appeared
behind
the
blind
of
the
adjoining
window
the
maid
had
shown
the
visitor
into
the
and
lit
the
lamp
upstairs
meanwhile
susy
was
no
doubt
running
skilful
fingers
through
her
tumbled
hair
and
daubing
her
pale
lips
with
red
ah
how
lansing
knew
every
movement
of
that
familiar
rite
even
to
the
pucker
of
the
brow
and
the
pouting
of
the
lower
lip
he
was
seized
with
a
sense
of
physical
sickness
as
the
succession
of
remembered
gestures
pressed
upon
his
eyes
and
the
other
man
the
other
man
inside
the
house
was
perhaps
at
that
very
instant
smiling
over
the
remembrance
of
the
same
scene
at
the
thought
lansing
plunged
away
into
the
night
xxvii
susy
and
lord
altringham
sat
in
the
little
divided
from
each
other
by
a
table
carrying
a
smoky
lamp
and
heaped
with
tattered
in
another
half
hour
the
bonne
despatched
to
fetch
the
children
from
their
classes
would
be
back
with
her
flock
and
at
any
moment
geordie
s
imperious
cries
might
summon
his
slave
up
to
the
nursery
in
the
scant
time
allotted
them
the
two
sat
and
visibly
wondered
what
to
say
strefford
on
entering
had
glanced
about
the
dreary
room
with
its
piano
laden
with
tattered
music
the
children
s
toys
littering
the
lame
sofa
the
bunches
of
dyed
grass
and
impaled
butterflies
flanking
the
clock
then
he
had
turned
to
susy
and
asked
simply
why
on
earth
are
you
here
she
had
not
tried
to
explain
from
the
first
she
had
understood
the
impossibility
of
doing
so
and
she
would
not
betray
her
secret
longing
to
return
to
nick
now
that
she
knew
that
nick
had
taken
definite
steps
for
his
release
in
dread
lest
strefford
should
have
heard
of
this
and
should
announce
it
to
her
coupling
it
with
the
news
of
nick
s
projected
marriage
and
lest
hearing
her
fears
thus
substantiated
she
should
lose
her
she
had
preferred
to
say
in
a
voice
that
she
tried
to
make
indifferent
the
proceedings
or
whatever
the
lawyers
call
them
have
begun
while
they
re
going
on
i
like
to
stay
quite
by
myself
i
don
t
know
why
strefford
at
that
had
looked
at
her
keenly
ah
he
murmured
and
his
lips
were
twisted
into
their
old
mocking
smile
speaking
of
proceedings
he
went
on
carelessly
what
stage
have
ellie
s
reached
i
wonder
i
saw
her
and
vanderlyn
and
bockheimer
all
lunching
cheerfully
together
at
larue
the
blood
rushed
to
susy
s
forehead
she
remembered
her
tragic
evening
with
nelson
vanderlyn
only
two
months
earlier
and
thought
to
herself
in
time
then
i
suppose
nick
and
i
aloud
she
said
i
can
t
imagine
how
nelson
and
ellie
can
ever
want
to
see
each
other
again
and
in
a
restaurant
of
all
places
strefford
continued
to
smile
my
dear
you
re
incorrigibly
why
should
two
people
who
ve
done
each
other
the
best
turn
they
could
by
getting
out
of
each
other
s
way
at
the
right
moment
behave
like
sworn
enemies
ever
afterward
it
s
too
absurd
the
humbug
s
too
flagrant
whatever
our
generation
has
failed
to
do
it
s
got
rid
of
humbug
and
that
s
enough
to
immortalize
it
i
daresay
nelson
and
ellie
never
liked
each
other
better
than
they
do
twenty
years
ago
they
d
have
been
afraid
to
confess
it
but
why
shouldn
t
they
now
susy
looked
at
strefford
conscious
that
under
his
words
was
the
ache
of
the
disappointment
she
had
caused
him
and
yet
conscious
also
that
that
very
ache
was
not
the
overwhelming
penetrating
emotion
he
perhaps
wished
it
to
be
but
a
pang
on
a
par
with
a
dozen
others
and
that
even
while
he
felt
it
he
foresaw
the
day
when
he
should
cease
to
feel
it
and
she
thought
to
herself
that
this
certainty
of
oblivion
must
be
bitterer
than
any
certainty
of
pain
a
silence
had
fallen
between
them
he
broke
it
by
rising
from
his
seat
and
saying
with
a
shrug
you
ll
end
by
driving
me
to
marry
joan
susy
smiled
well
why
not
she
s
yes
but
she
ll
bore
poor
streff
so
should
i
perhaps
but
nothing
like
as
soon
he
grinned
sardonically
there
d
be
more
he
appeared
to
wait
for
her
to
speak
and
what
else
on
earth
are
you
going
to
do
he
concluded
as
she
still
remained
silent
oh
streff
i
couldn
t
marry
you
for
a
reason
like
that
she
murmured
at
length
then
marry
me
and
find
your
reason
her
lips
made
a
movement
of
denial
and
still
in
silence
she
held
out
her
hand
for
he
clasped
it
and
then
turned
away
but
on
the
threshold
he
paused
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
wistfully
the
look
moved
her
and
she
added
hurriedly
the
only
reason
i
can
find
is
one
for
not
marrying
you
it
s
because
i
can
t
yet
feel
unmarried
unmarried
enough
but
i
thought
nick
was
doing
his
best
to
make
you
feel
yes
but
even
when
he
has
sometimes
i
think
even
that
won
t
make
any
he
still
scrutinized
her
hesitatingly
with
the
gravest
eyes
she
had
ever
seen
in
his
careless
face
my
dear
that
s
rather
the
way
i
feel
about
you
he
said
simply
as
he
turned
to
go
that
evening
after
the
children
had
gone
to
bed
susy
sat
up
late
in
the
cheerless
she
was
not
thinking
of
strefford
but
of
nick
he
was
coming
to
paris
perhaps
he
had
already
arrived
the
idea
that
he
might
be
in
the
same
place
with
her
at
that
very
moment
and
without
her
knowing
it
was
so
strange
and
painful
that
she
felt
a
violent
revolt
of
all
her
strong
and
youth
why
should
she
go
on
suffering
so
unbearably
so
abjectly
so
miserably
if
only
she
could
see
him
hear
his
voice
even
hear
him
say
again
such
cruel
and
humiliating
words
as
he
had
spoken
on
that
dreadful
day
in
venice
when
that
would
be
better
than
this
blankness
this
utter
and
final
exclusion
from
his
life
he
had
been
cruel
to
her
unimaginably
cruel
hard
arrogant
unjust
and
had
been
so
perhaps
deliberately
because
he
already
wanted
to
be
free
but
she
was
ready
to
face
even
that
possibility
to
humble
herself
still
farther
than
he
had
humbled
her
she
was
ready
to
do
anything
if
only
she
might
see
him
once
again
she
leaned
her
aching
head
on
her
hands
and
pondered
do
anything
but
what
could
she
do
nothing
that
should
hurt
him
interfere
with
his
liberty
be
false
to
the
spirit
of
their
pact
on
that
she
was
more
than
ever
resolved
she
had
made
a
bargain
and
she
meant
to
stick
to
it
not
for
any
abstract
reason
but
simply
because
she
happened
to
love
him
in
that
way
yes
but
to
see
him
again
only
once
suddenly
she
remembered
what
strefford
had
said
about
nelson
vanderlyn
and
his
wife
why
should
two
people
who
ve
just
done
each
other
the
best
turn
they
could
behave
like
sworn
enemies
ever
after
if
in
offering
nick
his
freedom
she
had
indeed
done
him
such
a
service
as
that
perhaps
he
no
longer
hated
her
would
no
longer
be
unwilling
to
see
her
at
any
rate
why
should
she
not
write
to
him
on
that
assumption
write
in
a
spirit
of
simple
friendliness
suggesting
that
they
should
meet
and
settle
things
the
word
settle
how
she
hated
it
would
prove
to
him
that
she
had
no
secret
designs
upon
his
liberty
and
besides
he
was
too
unprejudiced
too
modern
too
free
from
what
strefford
called
humbug
not
to
understand
and
accept
such
a
suggestion
after
all
perhaps
strefford
was
right
it
was
something
to
have
rid
human
relations
of
hypocrisy
even
if
in
the
process
so
many
exquisite
things
seemed
somehow
to
have
been
torn
away
with
it
she
ran
up
to
her
room
scribbled
a
note
and
hurried
with
it
through
the
rain
and
darkness
to
the
at
the
corner
as
she
returned
through
the
empty
street
she
had
an
odd
feeling
that
it
was
not
empty
that
perhaps
nick
was
already
there
somewhere
near
her
in
the
night
about
to
follow
her
to
the
door
enter
the
house
go
up
with
her
to
her
bedroom
in
the
old
way
it
was
strange
how
close
he
had
been
brought
by
the
mere
fact
of
her
having
written
that
little
note
to
him
in
the
bedroom
geordie
lay
in
his
crib
in
ruddy
slumber
and
she
blew
out
the
candle
and
undressed
softly
for
fear
of
waking
him
nick
lansing
the
next
day
received
susy
s
letter
transmitted
to
his
hotel
from
the
lawyer
s
office
he
read
it
carefully
two
or
three
times
over
weighing
and
scrutinizing
the
guarded
words
she
proposed
that
they
should
meet
to
settle
what
things
and
why
should
he
accede
to
such
a
request
what
secret
purpose
had
prompted
her
it
was
horrible
that
nowadays
in
thinking
of
susy
he
should
always
suspect
ulterior
motives
be
meanly
on
the
watch
for
some
hidden
tortuousness
what
on
earth
was
she
trying
to
manage
now
he
wondered
a
few
hours
ago
at
the
sight
of
her
all
his
hardness
had
melted
and
he
had
charged
himself
with
cruelty
with
injustice
with
every
sin
of
pride
against
himself
and
her
but
the
appearance
of
strefford
arriving
at
that
late
hour
and
so
evidently
expected
and
welcomed
had
driven
back
the
rising
tide
of
tenderness
yet
after
all
what
was
there
to
wonder
at
nothing
was
changed
in
their
respective
situations
he
had
left
his
wife
deliberately
and
for
reasons
which
no
subsequent
experience
had
caused
him
to
modify
she
had
apparently
acquiesced
in
his
decision
and
had
utilized
it
as
she
was
justified
in
doing
to
assure
her
own
future
in
all
this
what
was
there
to
wail
or
knock
the
breast
between
two
people
who
prided
themselves
on
looking
facts
in
the
face
and
making
their
grim
best
of
them
without
vain
repinings
he
had
been
right
in
thinking
their
marriage
an
act
of
madness
her
charms
had
overruled
his
judgment
and
they
had
had
their
year
their
mad
year
or
at
least
all
but
two
or
three
months
of
it
but
his
first
intuition
had
been
right
and
now
they
must
both
pay
for
their
madness
the
fates
seldom
forget
the
bargains
made
with
them
or
fail
to
ask
for
compound
interest
why
not
then
now
that
the
time
had
come
pay
up
gallantly
and
remember
of
the
episode
only
what
had
made
it
seem
so
supremely
worth
the
cost
he
sent
a
pneumatic
telegram
to
nicholas
lansing
to
say
that
he
would
call
on
her
that
afternoon
at
four
that
ought
to
give
us
time
he
reflected
drily
to
settle
things
as
she
calls
it
without
interfering
with
strefford
s
afternoon
xxviii
her
husband
s
note
had
briefly
said
at
four
o
clock
all
day
she
pored
over
the
words
in
an
agony
of
longing
trying
to
read
into
them
regret
emotion
memories
some
echo
of
the
tumult
in
her
own
bosom
but
she
had
signed
susy
and
he
signed
that
seemed
to
put
an
abyss
between
them
after
all
she
was
free
and
he
was
not
perhaps
in
view
of
his
situation
she
had
only
increased
the
distance
between
them
by
her
unconventional
request
for
a
meeting
she
sat
in
the
little
and
the
clock
ticked
out
the
minutes
she
would
not
look
out
of
the
window
it
might
bring
bad
luck
to
watch
for
him
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
thousand
invisible
spirits
hidden
demons
of
good
and
evil
pressed
about
her
spying
out
her
thoughts
counting
her
ready
to
pounce
upon
the
least
symptom
of
and
turn
it
deftly
to
derision
oh
for
an
altar
on
which
to
pour
out
propitiatory
offerings
but
what
sweeter
could
they
have
than
her
smothered
her
tears
the
bell
rang
and
she
stood
up
as
if
a
spring
had
jerked
her
to
her
feet
in
the
mirror
between
the
dried
grasses
her
face
looked
long
pale
inanimate
ah
if
he
should
find
her
too
changed
if
there
were
but
time
to
dash
upstairs
and
put
on
a
touch
of
red
the
door
opened
it
shut
on
him
he
was
there
he
said
you
wanted
to
see
me
she
answered
and
her
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
at
first
she
could
not
make
out
what
mysterious
change
had
come
over
him
and
why
it
was
that
in
looking
at
him
she
seemed
to
be
looking
at
a
stranger
then
she
perceived
that
his
voice
sounded
as
it
used
to
sound
when
he
was
talking
to
other
people
and
she
said
to
herself
with
a
sick
shiver
of
understanding
that
she
had
become
an
other
person
to
him
there
was
a
deathly
pause
then
she
faltered
out
not
knowing
what
she
said
nick
you
ll
sit
down
he
said
thanks
but
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
her
for
he
continued
to
stand
motionless
half
the
room
between
them
and
slowly
the
uselessness
the
hopelessness
of
his
being
there
overcame
her
a
wall
of
granite
seemed
to
have
built
itself
up
between
them
she
felt
as
if
it
hid
her
from
him
as
if
with
those
remote
new
eyes
of
his
he
were
staring
into
the
wall
and
not
at
her
suddenly
she
said
to
herself
he
s
suffering
more
than
i
am
because
he
pities
me
and
is
afraid
to
tell
me
that
he
is
going
to
be
the
thought
stung
her
pride
and
she
lifted
her
head
and
met
his
eyes
with
a
smile
don
t
you
think
she
said
it
s
more
sensible
with
everything
so
changed
in
our
lives
that
we
should
meet
as
friends
in
this
way
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
you
needn
t
feel
feel
in
the
least
unhappy
about
a
deep
flush
rose
to
his
forehead
oh
i
know
i
know
that
he
declared
hastily
and
added
with
a
factitious
animation
but
thank
you
for
telling
there
s
nothing
is
there
she
continued
to
make
our
meeting
in
this
way
in
the
least
embarrassing
or
painful
to
either
of
us
when
both
have
found
she
broke
off
and
held
her
hand
out
to
him
i
ve
heard
about
you
and
coral
she
ended
he
just
touched
her
hand
with
cold
fingers
and
let
it
drop
thank
you
he
said
for
the
third
time
you
won
t
sit
down
he
sat
down
don
t
you
think
she
continued
that
the
new
way
of
of
meeting
as
friends
and
talking
things
over
without
is
much
pleasanter
and
more
sensible
after
all
he
smiled
it
s
immensely
kind
of
you
to
feel
oh
i
do
feel
it
she
stopped
short
and
wondered
what
on
earth
she
had
meant
to
say
next
and
why
she
had
so
abruptly
lost
the
thread
of
her
discourse
in
the
pause
she
heard
him
cough
slightly
and
clear
his
throat
let
me
say
then
he
began
that
i
m
glad
too
immensely
glad
that
your
own
future
is
so
satisfactorily
she
lifted
her
glance
again
to
his
walled
face
in
which
not
a
muscle
stirred
yes
it
it
makes
everything
easier
for
you
doesn
t
it
for
you
too
i
he
paused
and
then
went
on
i
want
also
to
tell
you
that
i
perfectly
understand
oh
she
interrupted
so
do
i
your
point
of
view
i
they
were
again
silent
nick
why
can
t
we
be
friends
real
friends
won
t
it
be
easier
she
broke
out
at
last
with
twitching
lips
easier
i
mean
about
talking
things
over
arrangements
there
are
arrangements
to
be
made
i
suppose
i
suppose
he
hesitated
i
m
doing
what
i
m
told
simply
following
out
instructions
the
business
is
easy
enough
apparently
i
m
taking
the
necessary
steps
she
reddened
a
little
and
drew
a
gasping
breath
the
necessary
steps
what
are
they
everything
the
lawyers
tell
one
is
so
confusing
i
don
t
yet
understand
how
it
s
my
share
you
mean
oh
it
s
very
he
paused
and
added
in
a
tone
of
laboured
ease
i
m
going
down
to
fontainebleau
she
stared
not
understanding
to
fontainebleau
her
bewilderment
drew
from
him
his
first
frank
smile
well
i
chose
fontainebleau
i
don
t
know
why
except
that
we
ve
never
been
there
at
that
she
suddenly
understood
and
the
blood
rushed
to
her
forehead
she
stood
up
without
knowing
what
she
was
doing
her
heart
in
her
throat
how
grotesque
how
utterly
disgusting
he
gave
a
slight
shrug
i
didn
t
make
the
laws
but
isn
t
it
too
stupid
and
degrading
that
such
things
should
be
necessary
when
two
people
want
to
part
she
broke
off
again
silenced
by
the
echo
of
that
fatal
want
to
he
seemed
to
prefer
not
to
dwell
farther
on
the
legal
obligations
involved
you
haven
t
yet
told
me
he
suggested
how
you
happen
to
be
living
here
with
the
fulmer
children
she
roused
herself
trying
to
catch
his
easier
note
oh
i
ve
simply
been
governessing
them
for
a
few
weeks
while
nat
and
grace
are
in
she
did
not
say
it
s
because
i
ve
parted
with
somehow
it
helped
her
wounded
pride
a
little
to
keep
from
him
the
secret
of
her
precarious
independence
he
looked
his
wonder
all
alone
with
that
bewildered
bonne
but
how
many
of
them
are
there
five
good
lord
he
contemplated
the
clock
with
unseeing
eyes
and
then
turned
them
again
on
her
face
i
should
have
thought
a
lot
of
children
would
rather
get
on
your
oh
not
these
children
they
re
so
good
to
ah
well
i
suppose
it
won
t
be
for
he
sent
his
eyes
again
about
the
room
which
his
gaze
seemed
to
reduce
to
its
dismal
constituent
elements
and
added
with
an
obvious
effort
at
small
talk
i
hear
the
fulmers
are
not
hitting
it
off
very
well
since
his
success
is
it
true
that
he
s
going
to
marry
violet
melrose
the
blood
rose
to
susy
s
face
oh
never
never
he
and
grace
are
travelling
together
oh
i
didn
t
know
people
say
things
he
was
visibly
embarrassed
with
the
subject
and
sorry
that
he
had
broached
it
some
of
the
things
that
people
say
are
true
but
grace
doesn
t
mind
she
says
she
and
nat
belong
to
each
other
they
can
t
help
it
she
thinks
after
having
been
through
such
a
lot
dear
old
grace
he
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
this
time
she
made
no
effort
to
detain
him
he
seemed
to
have
recovered
his
and
it
struck
her
painfully
humiliatingly
almost
that
he
should
have
spoken
in
that
light
way
of
the
expedition
to
fontainebleau
on
the
morrow
well
men
were
different
she
supposed
she
remembered
having
felt
that
once
before
about
nick
it
was
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
cry
out
but
wait
wait
i
m
not
going
to
marry
strefford
after
all
but
to
do
so
would
seem
like
an
appeal
to
his
compassion
to
his
indulgence
and
that
was
not
what
she
wanted
she
could
never
forget
that
he
had
left
her
because
he
had
not
been
able
to
forgive
her
for
managing
and
not
for
the
world
would
she
have
him
think
that
this
meeting
had
been
planned
for
such
a
purpose
if
he
doesn
t
see
that
i
am
different
in
spite
of
appearances
and
that
i
never
was
what
he
said
i
was
that
day
if
in
all
these
months
it
hasn
t
come
over
him
what
s
the
use
of
trying
to
make
him
see
it
now
she
mused
and
then
her
thoughts
hurrying
on
perhaps
he
s
suffering
too
i
believe
he
is
suffering
at
any
rate
he
s
suffering
for
me
if
not
for
himself
but
if
he
s
pledged
to
coral
what
can
he
do
what
would
he
think
of
me
if
i
tried
to
make
him
break
his
word
to
her
there
he
stood
the
man
who
was
going
to
fontainebleau
who
called
it
taking
the
necessary
steps
who
could
smile
as
he
made
the
careless
statement
a
world
seemed
to
divide
them
already
it
was
as
if
their
parting
were
already
over
all
the
words
cries
arguments
beating
loud
wings
in
her
dropped
back
into
silence
the
only
thought
left
was
how
much
longer
does
he
mean
to
go
on
standing
there
he
may
have
read
the
question
in
her
face
for
turning
back
from
an
absorbed
contemplation
of
the
window
curtains
he
said
there
s
nothing
else
nothing
else
i
mean
you
spoke
of
things
to
be
settled
she
flushed
suddenly
remembering
the
pretext
she
had
used
to
summon
him
oh
she
faltered
i
didn
t
know
i
thought
there
might
be
but
the
lawyers
i
suppose
she
saw
the
relief
on
his
contracted
face
exactly
i
ve
always
thought
it
was
best
to
leave
it
to
them
i
assure
you
again
for
a
moment
the
smile
strained
his
lips
i
shall
do
nothing
to
interfere
with
a
quick
she
stood
motionless
feeling
herself
turn
to
stone
he
appeared
already
a
long
way
off
like
a
figure
vanishing
down
a
remote
perspective
then
she
heard
him
say
from
its
farther
end
oh
she
faltered
as
if
she
had
not
had
the
word
ready
and
was
relieved
to
have
him
supply
it
he
stopped
again
on
the
threshold
looked
back
at
her
began
to
speak
i
ve
he
said
then
he
repeated
as
though
to
make
sure
he
had
not
forgotten
to
say
it
and
the
door
closed
on
him
it
was
over
she
had
had
her
last
chance
and
missed
it
now
whatever
happened
the
one
thing
she
had
lived
and
longed
for
would
never
be
he
had
come
and
she
had
let
him
go
again
how
had
it
come
about
would
she
ever
be
able
to
explain
it
to
herself
how
was
it
that
she
so
fertile
in
strategy
so
practiced
in
feminine
arts
had
stood
there
before
him
helpless
inarticulate
like
a
with
her
first
if
he
was
gone
and
gone
never
to
return
it
was
her
own
fault
and
none
but
hers
what
had
she
done
to
move
him
detain
him
make
his
heart
beat
and
his
head
swim
as
hers
were
beating
and
swimming
she
stood
aghast
at
her
own
inadequacy
her
stony
inexpressiveness
and
suddenly
she
lifted
her
hands
to
her
throbbing
forehead
and
cried
out
but
this
is
love
this
must
be
love
she
had
loved
him
before
she
supposed
for
what
else
was
she
to
call
the
impulse
that
had
drawn
her
to
him
taught
her
how
to
overcome
his
scruples
and
whirled
him
away
with
her
on
their
mad
adventure
well
if
that
was
love
this
was
something
so
much
larger
and
deeper
that
the
other
feeling
seemed
the
mere
dancing
of
her
blood
in
tune
with
his
but
no
real
love
great
love
the
love
that
poets
sang
and
privileged
and
tortured
beings
lived
and
died
of
that
love
had
its
own
superior
expressiveness
and
the
sure
command
of
its
means
the
petty
arts
of
coquetry
were
no
farther
from
it
than
the
numbness
of
the
untaught
girl
great
love
was
wise
strong
powerful
like
genius
like
any
other
dominant
form
of
human
power
it
knew
itself
and
what
it
wanted
and
how
to
attain
its
ends
not
great
love
then
but
just
the
common
humble
average
of
human
love
was
hers
and
it
had
come
to
her
so
newly
so
overwhelmingly
with
a
face
so
grave
a
touch
so
startling
that
she
had
stood
there
petrified
humbled
at
the
first
look
of
its
eyes
recognizing
that
what
she
had
once
taken
for
love
was
merely
pleasure
and
and
the
flavour
of
youth
but
how
was
i
to
know
and
now
it
s
too
late
she
wailed
xxix
the
inhabitants
of
the
little
house
in
passy
were
of
necessity
early
risers
but
when
susy
jumped
out
of
bed
the
next
morning
no
one
else
was
astir
and
it
lacked
nearly
an
hour
of
the
call
of
the
bonne
s
for
a
moment
susy
leaned
out
of
her
dark
room
into
the
darker
night
a
cold
drizzle
fell
on
her
face
and
she
shivered
and
drew
back
then
lighting
a
candle
and
shading
it
as
her
habit
was
from
the
sleeping
child
she
slipped
on
her
and
opened
the
door
on
the
threshold
she
paused
to
look
at
her
watch
only
five
she
thought
with
compunction
of
the
unkindness
of
breaking
in
on
junie
fulmer
s
slumbers
but
such
scruples
did
not
weigh
an
ounce
in
the
balance
of
her
purpose
poor
junie
would
have
to
oversleep
herself
on
sunday
that
was
all
susy
stole
into
the
passage
opened
a
door
and
cast
her
light
on
the
girl
s
face
junie
dearest
junie
you
must
wake
up
junie
lay
in
the
abandonment
of
youthful
sleep
but
at
the
sound
of
her
name
she
sat
up
with
the
promptness
of
a
grown
person
on
whom
domestic
burdens
have
long
weighed
which
one
of
them
is
it
she
asked
one
foot
already
out
of
bed
oh
junie
dear
no
it
s
nothing
wrong
with
the
children
or
with
anybody
susy
stammered
on
her
knees
by
the
bed
in
the
candlelight
she
saw
junie
s
anxious
brow
darken
reproachfully
oh
susy
then
why
i
was
just
dreaming
we
were
all
driving
about
rome
in
a
great
big
with
father
and
mother
i
m
so
sorry
dear
what
a
lovely
dream
i
m
a
brute
to
have
interrupted
it
she
felt
the
little
girl
s
awakening
scrutiny
if
there
s
nothing
wrong
with
anybody
why
are
you
crying
susy
is
it
you
there
s
something
wrong
with
what
has
happened
am
i
crying
susy
rose
from
her
knees
and
sat
down
on
the
counterpane
yes
it
is
me
and
i
had
to
disturb
oh
susy
darling
what
is
it
junie
s
arms
were
about
her
in
a
flash
and
susy
grasped
them
in
burning
fingers
junie
listen
i
ve
got
to
go
away
at
once
to
leave
you
all
for
the
whole
day
i
may
not
be
back
till
late
this
evening
late
i
can
t
tell
i
promised
your
mother
i
d
never
leave
you
but
i
ve
got
to
i
ve
got
junie
considered
her
agitated
face
with
fully
awakened
eyes
oh
i
won
t
tell
you
know
you
old
brick
she
said
with
simplicity
susy
hugged
her
junie
junie
you
darling
but
that
wasn
t
what
i
meant
of
course
you
may
tell
you
must
tell
i
shall
write
to
your
mother
myself
but
what
worries
me
is
the
idea
of
having
to
go
away
away
from
paris
for
the
whole
day
with
geordie
still
coughing
a
little
and
no
one
but
that
silly
angele
to
stay
with
him
while
you
re
out
and
no
one
but
you
to
take
yourself
and
the
others
to
school
but
junie
junie
i
ve
got
to
do
it
she
sobbed
out
clutching
the
child
tighter
junie
fulmer
with
her
strangely
mature
perception
of
the
case
and
seemingly
of
every
case
that
fate
might
call
on
her
to
deal
with
sat
for
a
moment
motionless
in
susy
s
hold
then
she
freed
her
wrists
with
an
adroit
twist
and
leaning
back
against
the
pillows
said
judiciously
you
ll
never
in
the
world
bring
up
a
family
of
your
own
if
you
take
on
like
this
over
other
people
s
through
all
her
turmoil
of
spirit
the
observation
drew
a
laugh
from
susy
oh
a
family
of
my
own
i
don
t
deserve
one
the
way
i
m
behaving
to
your
junie
still
considered
her
my
dear
a
change
will
do
you
good
you
need
it
she
pronounced
susy
rose
with
a
laughing
sigh
i
m
not
at
all
sure
it
will
but
i
ve
got
to
have
it
all
the
same
only
i
do
feel
anxious
and
i
can
t
even
leave
you
my
address
junie
still
seemed
to
examine
the
case
can
t
you
even
tell
me
where
you
re
going
she
ventured
as
if
not
quite
sure
of
the
delicacy
of
asking
well
no
i
don
t
think
i
can
not
till
i
get
back
besides
even
if
i
could
it
wouldn
t
be
much
use
because
i
couldn
t
give
you
my
address
there
i
don
t
know
what
it
will
but
what
does
it
matter
if
you
re
coming
back
of
course
i
m
coming
back
how
could
you
possibly
imagine
i
should
think
of
leaving
you
for
more
than
a
day
oh
i
shouldn
t
be
afraid
not
much
that
is
with
the
poker
and
nat
s
emended
junie
still
judicious
susy
again
enfolded
her
vehemently
and
then
turned
to
more
practical
matters
she
explained
that
she
wished
if
possible
to
catch
an
train
from
the
gare
de
lyon
and
that
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
if
the
children
were
to
be
dressed
and
fed
and
full
instructions
written
out
for
junie
and
angele
before
she
rushed
for
the
underground
while
she
bathed
geordie
and
then
hurried
into
her
own
clothes
she
could
not
help
wondering
at
her
own
extreme
solicitude
for
her
charges
she
remembered
with
a
pang
how
often
she
had
deserted
clarissa
vanderlyn
for
the
whole
day
and
even
for
two
or
three
in
succession
poor
little
clarissa
whom
she
knew
to
be
so
unprotected
so
exposed
to
evil
influences
she
had
been
too
much
absorbed
in
her
own
greedy
bliss
to
be
more
than
intermittently
aware
of
the
child
but
now
she
felt
no
sorrow
however
ravaging
no
happiness
however
absorbing
would
ever
again
isolate
her
from
her
kind
and
then
these
children
were
so
different
the
exquisite
clarissa
was
already
the
predestined
victim
of
her
surroundings
her
budding
soul
was
divided
from
susy
s
by
the
same
barrier
of
incomprehension
that
separated
the
latter
from
vanderlyn
clarissa
had
nothing
to
teach
susy
but
the
horror
of
her
own
hard
little
appetites
whereas
the
company
of
the
noisy
argumentative
fulmers
had
been
a
school
of
wisdom
and
abnegation
as
she
applied
the
brush
to
geordie
s
shining
head
and
the
handkerchief
to
his
snuffling
nose
the
sense
of
what
she
owed
him
was
so
borne
in
on
susy
that
she
interrupted
the
process
to
catch
him
to
her
bosom
i
ll
have
such
a
story
to
tell
you
when
i
get
back
if
you
ll
promise
me
to
be
good
all
day
she
bargained
with
him
and
geordie
always
astute
bargained
back
before
i
promise
i
d
like
to
know
what
at
length
all
was
in
order
junie
had
been
enlightened
and
angele
stunned
by
the
minuteness
of
susy
s
instructions
and
the
latter
waterproofed
and
stoutly
shod
descended
the
doorstep
and
paused
to
wave
at
the
pyramid
of
heads
yearning
to
her
from
an
upper
window
it
was
hardly
light
and
still
raining
when
she
turned
into
the
dismal
street
as
usual
it
was
empty
but
at
the
corner
she
perceived
a
hesitating
taxi
with
luggage
piled
beside
the
driver
perhaps
it
was
some
early
traveller
just
arriving
who
would
release
the
carriage
in
time
for
her
to
catch
it
and
thus
avoid
the
walk
to
the
metro
and
the
subsequent
for
it
was
the
s
hour
susy
raced
toward
the
vehicle
which
overcoming
its
hesitation
was
beginning
to
move
in
her
direction
observing
this
she
stopped
to
see
where
it
would
discharge
its
load
thereupon
the
taxi
stopped
also
and
the
load
discharged
itself
in
front
of
her
in
the
shape
of
nick
lansing
the
two
stood
staring
at
each
other
through
the
rain
till
nick
broke
out
where
are
you
going
i
came
to
get
to
get
me
to
get
me
she
repeated
beside
the
driver
she
had
suddenly
remarked
the
old
from
which
her
husband
had
obliged
her
to
extract
strefford
s
cigars
as
they
were
leaving
como
and
everything
that
had
happened
since
seemed
to
fall
away
and
vanish
in
the
pang
and
rapture
of
that
memory
to
get
you
yes
of
he
spoke
the
words
peremptorily
almost
as
if
they
were
an
order
where
were
you
going
he
repeated
without
answering
she
turned
toward
the
house
he
followed
her
and
the
laden
taxi
closed
the
procession
why
are
you
out
in
such
weather
without
an
umbrella
he
continued
in
the
same
severe
tone
drawing
her
under
the
shelter
of
his
oh
because
junie
s
umbrella
is
in
tatters
and
i
had
to
leave
her
mine
as
i
was
going
away
for
the
whole
she
spoke
the
words
like
a
person
in
a
trance
for
the
whole
day
at
this
hour
where
they
were
on
the
doorstep
and
she
fumbled
automatically
for
her
key
let
herself
in
and
led
the
way
to
the
it
had
not
been
tidied
up
since
the
night
before
the
children
s
school
books
lay
scattered
on
the
table
and
sofa
and
the
empty
fireplace
was
grey
with
ashes
she
turned
to
nick
in
the
pallid
light
i
was
going
to
see
you
she
stammered
i
was
going
to
follow
you
to
fontainebleau
if
necessary
to
tell
you
to
prevent
you
he
repeated
in
the
same
aggressive
tone
tell
me
what
prevent
what
tell
you
that
there
must
be
some
other
way
some
decent
way
of
our
separating
without
that
horror
that
horror
of
your
going
off
with
a
woman
he
stared
and
then
burst
into
a
laugh
the
blood
rushed
to
her
face
she
had
caught
a
familiar
ring
in
his
laugh
and
it
wounded
her
what
business
had
he
at
such
a
time
to
laugh
in
the
old
way
i
m
sorry
but
there
is
no
other
way
i
m
afraid
no
other
way
but
one
he
corrected
himself
she
raised
her
head
sharply
well
that
you
should
be
the
oh
my
dear
he
had
dropped
his
mocking
smile
and
was
at
her
side
her
hands
in
his
oh
my
dear
don
t
you
see
that
we
ve
both
been
feeling
the
same
thing
and
at
the
same
hour
you
lay
awake
thinking
of
it
all
night
didn
t
you
so
did
i
whenever
the
clock
struck
i
said
to
myself
she
s
hearing
it
and
i
was
up
before
daylight
and
packed
my
traps
for
i
never
want
to
set
foot
again
in
that
awful
hotel
where
i
ve
lived
in
hell
for
the
last
three
days
and
i
swore
to
myself
that
i
d
go
off
with
a
woman
by
the
first
train
i
could
catch
and
so
i
mean
to
my
she
stood
before
him
numb
yes
numb
that
was
the
worst
of
it
the
violence
of
the
reaction
had
been
too
great
and
she
could
hardly
understand
what
he
was
saying
instead
she
noticed
that
the
tassel
of
the
was
torn
off
again
oh
those
children
and
vaguely
wondered
if
his
luggage
were
safe
on
the
waiting
taxi
one
heard
such
stories
his
voice
came
back
to
her
susy
listen
he
was
entreating
you
must
see
yourself
that
it
can
t
be
we
re
married
isn
t
that
all
that
matters
oh
i
know
i
ve
behaved
like
a
brute
a
cursed
arrogant
ass
you
couldn
t
wish
that
ass
a
worse
kicking
than
i
ve
given
him
but
that
s
not
the
point
you
see
the
point
is
that
we
re
married
married
doesn
t
it
mean
something
to
you
something
inexorable
it
does
to
me
i
didn
t
dream
it
would
in
just
that
way
but
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
suppose
the
people
who
don
t
feel
it
aren
t
really
married
and
they
d
better
separate
much
better
as
for
us
through
her
tears
she
gasped
out
that
s
what
i
felt
that
s
what
i
said
to
streff
he
was
upon
her
with
a
great
embrace
my
darling
my
darling
you
have
told
him
yes
she
panted
that
s
why
i
m
living
she
paused
and
you
ve
told
coral
she
felt
his
embrace
relax
he
drew
away
a
little
still
holding
her
but
with
lowered
head
no
i
haven
oh
nick
but
then
he
caught
her
to
him
again
resentfully
well
then
what
what
do
you
mean
what
earthly
difference
does
it
make
but
if
you
ve
told
her
you
were
going
to
marry
her
try
as
she
would
her
voice
was
full
of
silver
chimes
marry
her
marry
her
he
echoed
but
how
could
i
what
does
marriage
mean
anyhow
if
it
means
anything
at
all
it
means
you
and
i
can
t
ask
coral
hicks
just
to
come
and
live
with
me
can
i
between
crying
and
laughing
she
lay
on
his
breast
and
his
hand
passed
over
her
hair
they
were
silent
for
a
while
then
he
began
again
you
said
it
yourself
yesterday
you
she
strayed
back
from
sunlit
distances
yesterday
yes
that
grace
fulmer
says
you
can
t
separate
two
people
who
ve
been
through
a
lot
of
things
ah
been
through
them
together
it
s
not
the
things
you
see
it
s
the
togetherness
she
interrupted
the
togetherness
that
s
it
he
seized
on
the
word
as
if
it
had
just
been
coined
to
express
their
case
and
his
mind
could
rest
in
it
without
farther
labour
the
rang
and
they
started
through
the
window
they
saw
the
gesticulating
enquiries
as
to
the
fate
of
the
luggage
he
wants
to
know
if
he
s
to
leave
it
here
susy
laughed
no
no
you
re
to
come
with
me
her
husband
declared
come
with
you
she
laughed
again
at
the
absurdity
of
the
suggestion
of
course
this
very
instant
what
did
you
suppose
that
i
was
going
away
without
you
run
up
and
pack
your
things
he
commanded
my
things
my
things
but
i
can
t
leave
the
children
he
stared
between
indignation
and
amusement
can
t
leave
the
children
nonsense
why
you
said
yourself
you
were
going
to
follow
me
to
fontainebleau
she
reddened
again
this
time
a
little
painfully
i
didn
t
know
what
i
was
doing
i
had
to
find
you
but
i
should
have
come
back
this
evening
no
matter
what
no
matter
what
she
nodded
and
met
his
gaze
resolutely
no
but
really
really
i
can
t
leave
the
children
till
nat
and
grace
come
back
i
promised
i
wouldn
yes
but
you
didn
t
know
then
why
on
earth
can
t
their
nurse
look
after
them
there
isn
t
any
nurse
but
good
lord
but
it
s
only
for
two
weeks
more
she
pleaded
two
weeks
do
you
know
how
long
i
ve
been
without
you
he
seized
her
by
both
wrists
and
drew
them
against
his
breast
come
with
me
at
least
for
two
days
susy
he
entreated
her
oh
she
cried
that
s
the
very
first
time
you
ve
said
my
name
susy
susy
then
my
susy
susy
and
you
ve
only
said
mine
once
you
nick
she
sighed
at
peace
as
if
the
one
syllable
were
a
magic
seed
that
hung
out
great
branches
to
envelop
them
well
then
susy
be
reasonable
come
reasonable
oh
reasonable
she
sobbed
through
laughter
unreasonable
then
that
s
even
she
freed
herself
and
drew
back
gently
nick
i
swore
i
wouldn
t
leave
them
and
i
can
t
it
s
not
only
my
promise
to
their
mother
it
s
what
they
ve
been
to
me
themselves
you
don
t
know
you
can
t
imagine
the
things
they
ve
taught
me
they
re
awfully
naughty
at
times
because
they
re
so
clever
but
when
they
re
good
they
re
the
wisest
people
i
she
paused
and
a
sudden
inspiration
illuminated
her
but
why
shouldn
t
we
take
them
with
us
she
exclaimed
her
husband
s
arms
fell
away
from
her
and
he
stood
dumfounded
take
them
with
us
why
not
all
five
of
them
of
course
i
couldn
t
possibly
separate
them
and
junie
and
nat
will
help
us
to
look
after
the
young
help
us
he
groaned
oh
you
ll
see
they
won
t
bother
you
just
leave
it
to
me
i
ll
manage
the
word
stopped
her
short
and
an
agony
of
crimson
suffused
her
from
brow
to
throat
their
eyes
met
and
without
a
word
he
stooped
and
laid
his
lips
gently
on
the
stain
of
red
on
her
neck
nick
she
breathed
her
hands
in
his
but
those
children
instead
of
answering
she
questioned
where
are
we
going
his
face
lit
up
anywhere
dearest
that
you
well
i
choose
fontainebleau
she
exulted
so
do
i
but
we
can
t
take
all
those
children
to
an
hotel
at
fontainebleau
can
we
he
questioned
weakly
you
see
dear
there
s
the
mere
expense
of
it
her
eyes
were
already
travelling
far
ahead
of
him
the
expense
won
t
amount
to
much
i
ve
just
remembered
that
angele
the
bonne
has
a
sister
who
is
cook
there
in
a
nice
pension
which
must
be
almost
empty
at
this
time
of
year
i
m
sure
i
can
ma
arrange
easily
she
hurried
on
nearly
tripping
again
over
the
fatal
word
and
just
think
of
the
treat
it
will
be
to
them
this
is
friday
and
i
can
get
them
let
off
from
their
afternoon
classes
and
keep
them
in
the
country
till
monday
poor
darlings
they
haven
t
been
out
of
paris
for
months
and
i
daresay
the
change
will
cure
geordie
s
cough
geordie
s
the
youngest
she
explained
surprised
to
find
herself
even
in
the
rapture
of
reunion
so
absorbed
in
the
welfare
of
the
fulmers
she
was
conscious
that
her
husband
was
surprised
also
but
instead
of
prolonging
the
argument
he
simply
questioned
was
geordie
the
chap
you
had
in
your
arms
when
you
opened
the
front
door
the
night
before
last
she
echoed
i
opened
the
front
door
the
night
before
last
to
a
boy
with
a
oh
she
sobbed
you
were
there
you
were
watching
he
held
her
to
him
and
the
currents
flowed
between
them
warm
and
full
as
on
the
night
of
their
moon
over
como
in
a
trice
after
that
she
had
the
matter
in
hand
and
her
forces
marshalled
the
taxi
was
paid
nick
s
luggage
deposited
in
the
vestibule
and
the
children
just
piling
down
to
breakfast
were
summoned
in
to
hear
the
news
it
was
apparent
that
seasoned
to
surprises
as
they
were
nick
s
presence
took
them
aback
but
when
between
laughter
and
embraces
his
identity
and
his
right
to
be
where
he
was
had
been
made
clear
to
them
junie
dismissed
the
matter
by
asking
him
in
her
practical
way
then
i
suppose
we
may
talk
about
you
to
susy
now
and
thereafter
all
five
addressed
themselves
to
the
vision
of
their
imminent
holiday
from
that
moment
the
little
house
became
the
centre
of
a
whirlwind
treats
so
unforeseen
and
of
such
magnitude
were
rare
in
the
young
fulmers
experience
and
had
it
not
been
for
junie
s
steadying
influence
susy
s
charges
would
have
got
out
of
hand
but
young
nat
appealed
to
by
nick
on
the
ground
of
their
common
manhood
was
induced
to
forego
celebrating
the
event
on
his
motor
horn
the
very
same
which
had
tortured
the
new
hampshire
echoes
and
to
assert
his
authority
over
his
juniors
and
finally
a
plan
began
to
emerge
from
the
chaos
and
each
child
to
fit
into
it
like
a
bit
of
a
picture
puzzle
susy
riding
the
whirlwind
with
her
usual
firmness
nevertheless
felt
an
undercurrent
of
anxiety
there
had
been
no
time
as
yet
between
her
and
nick
to
revert
to
money
matters
and
where
there
was
so
little
money
it
could
not
obviously
much
matter
but
that
was
the
more
reason
for
being
secretly
aghast
at
her
intrepid
resolve
not
to
separate
herself
from
her
charges
a
three
days
with
five
children
in
the
party
and
children
with
the
fulmer
appetite
could
not
but
be
a
costly
business
and
while
she
settled
details
packed
them
off
to
school
and
routed
out
such
nondescript
receptacles
as
the
house
contained
in
the
way
of
luggage
her
thoughts
remained
fixed
on
the
familiar
financial
problem
yes
it
was
cruel
to
have
it
rear
its
hated
head
even
through
the
bursting
boughs
of
her
new
spring
but
there
it
was
the
perpetual
serpent
in
her
eden
to
be
bribed
fed
sent
to
sleep
with
such
scraps
as
she
could
beg
borrow
or
steal
for
it
and
she
supposed
it
was
the
price
that
fate
meant
her
to
pay
for
her
blessedness
and
was
surer
than
ever
that
the
blessedness
was
worth
it
only
how
was
she
to
compound
the
business
with
her
new
principles
with
the
children
s
things
to
pack
luncheon
to
be
got
ready
and
the
fontainebleau
pension
to
be
telephoned
to
there
was
little
time
to
waste
on
moral
casuistry
and
susy
asked
herself
with
a
certain
irony
if
the
chronic
lack
of
time
to
deal
with
money
difficulties
had
not
been
the
chief
cause
of
her
previous
lapses
there
was
no
time
to
deal
with
this
question
either
no
time
in
short
to
do
anything
but
rush
forward
on
a
great
gale
of
plans
and
preparations
in
the
course
of
which
she
whirled
nick
forth
to
buy
some
charcuterie
for
luncheon
and
telephone
to
fontainebleau
once
he
was
gone
and
after
watching
him
safely
round
the
corner
she
too
got
into
her
wraps
and
transferring
a
small
packet
from
her
to
her
pocket
hastened
out
in
a
different
direction
xxx
it
took
two
brimming
to
carry
the
nicholas
lansings
to
the
station
on
their
second
in
the
first
were
nick
susy
and
the
luggage
of
the
whole
party
little
nat
s
motor
horn
included
as
a
last
concession
and
because
he
had
hitherto
forborne
to
play
on
it
and
in
the
second
the
five
fulmers
the
bonne
who
at
the
eleventh
hour
had
refused
to
be
left
a
of
canaries
and
a
foundling
kitten
who
had
murderous
designs
on
them
all
of
which
had
to
be
taken
because
if
the
bonne
came
there
would
be
nobody
left
to
look
after
them
at
the
corner
susy
tore
herself
from
nick
s
arms
and
held
up
the
procession
while
she
ran
back
to
the
second
taxi
to
make
sure
that
the
bonne
had
brought
the
it
was
found
of
course
that
she
hadn
t
but
that
junie
had
whereupon
the
caravan
got
under
way
again
and
reached
the
station
just
as
the
train
was
starting
and
there
by
some
miracle
of
good
nature
on
the
part
of
the
guard
they
were
all
packed
together
into
an
empty
compartment
no
doubt
as
susy
remarked
because
train
officials
never
failed
to
spot
a
couple
and
treat
them
kindly
the
children
sentinelled
by
junie
at
first
gave
promise
of
superhuman
goodness
but
presently
their
feelings
overflowed
and
they
were
not
to
be
quieted
till
it
had
been
agreed
that
nat
should
blow
his
at
each
halt
while
the
twins
called
out
the
names
of
the
stations
and
geordie
with
the
canaries
and
kitten
affected
to
change
trains
luckily
the
halts
were
few
but
the
excitement
of
travel
combined
with
in
the
chocolates
imprudently
provided
by
nick
overwhelmed
geordie
with
a
sudden
melancholy
that
could
be
appeased
only
by
susy
s
telling
him
stories
till
they
arrived
at
fontainebleau
the
day
was
soft
with
mild
gleams
of
sunlight
on
decaying
foliage
and
after
luggage
and
livestock
had
been
dropped
at
the
pension
susy
confessed
that
she
had
promised
the
children
a
scamper
in
the
forest
and
buns
in
a
afterward
nick
placidly
agreed
and
darkness
had
long
fallen
and
a
great
many
buns
been
consumed
when
at
length
the
procession
turned
down
the
street
toward
the
pension
headed
by
nick
with
the
sleeping
geordie
on
his
shoulder
while
the
others
speechless
with
fatigue
and
food
hung
heavily
on
susy
it
had
been
decided
that
as
the
bonne
was
of
the
party
the
children
might
be
entrusted
to
her
for
the
night
and
nick
and
susy
establish
themselves
in
an
adjacent
hotel
nick
had
flattered
himself
that
they
might
remove
their
possessions
there
when
they
returned
from
the
but
susy
manifestly
surprised
at
the
idea
reminded
him
that
her
charges
must
first
be
given
their
supper
and
put
to
bed
she
suggested
that
he
should
meanwhile
take
the
bags
to
the
hotel
and
promised
to
join
him
as
soon
as
geordie
was
asleep
she
was
a
long
time
coming
but
waiting
for
her
was
sweet
even
in
a
deserted
hotel
insufficiently
heated
by
a
sulky
stove
and
after
he
had
glanced
through
his
morning
s
mail
hurriedly
thrust
into
his
pocket
as
he
left
paris
he
sank
into
a
state
of
drowsy
beatitude
it
was
all
the
maddest
business
in
the
world
yet
it
did
not
give
him
the
sense
of
unreality
that
had
made
their
first
adventure
a
mere
golden
dream
and
he
sat
and
waited
with
the
security
of
one
in
whom
dear
habits
have
struck
deep
roots
in
this
mood
of
acquiescence
even
the
presence
of
the
five
fulmers
seemed
a
natural
and
necessary
consequence
of
all
the
rest
and
when
susy
at
length
appeared
a
little
pale
and
tired
with
the
brooding
inward
look
that
busy
mothers
bring
from
the
nursery
that
too
seemed
natural
and
necessary
and
part
of
the
new
order
of
things
they
had
wandered
out
to
a
cheap
restaurant
for
dinner
now
in
the
damp
december
night
they
were
walking
back
to
the
hotel
under
a
sky
full
of
they
seemed
to
have
said
everything
to
each
other
and
yet
barely
to
have
begun
what
they
had
to
tell
and
at
each
step
they
took
their
heavy
feet
dragged
a
great
load
of
bliss
in
the
hotel
almost
all
the
lights
were
already
out
and
they
groped
their
way
to
the
third
floor
room
which
was
the
only
one
that
susy
had
found
cheap
enough
a
ray
from
a
struck
up
through
the
unshuttered
windows
and
after
nick
had
revived
the
fire
they
drew
their
chairs
close
to
it
and
sat
quietly
for
a
while
in
the
dark
their
silence
was
so
sweet
that
nick
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
break
it
not
to
do
so
gave
his
tossing
spirit
such
a
sense
of
permanence
of
having
at
last
unlimited
time
before
him
in
which
to
taste
his
joy
and
let
its
sweetness
stream
through
him
but
at
length
he
roused
himself
to
say
it
s
queer
how
things
coincide
i
ve
had
a
little
bit
of
good
news
in
one
of
the
letters
i
got
this
susy
took
the
announcement
serenely
well
you
would
you
know
she
commented
as
if
the
day
had
been
too
obviously
designed
for
bliss
to
escape
the
notice
of
its
dispensers
yes
he
continued
with
a
thrill
of
pardonable
pride
during
the
cruise
i
did
a
couple
of
articles
on
crete
oh
just
of
course
they
couldn
t
be
more
but
the
editor
of
the
new
review
has
accepted
them
and
asks
for
others
and
here
s
his
cheque
if
you
please
so
you
see
you
might
have
let
me
take
the
jolly
room
downstairs
with
the
pink
curtains
and
it
makes
me
awfully
hopeful
about
my
he
had
expected
a
rapturous
outburst
and
perhaps
some
reassertion
of
wifely
faith
in
the
glorious
future
that
awaited
the
pageant
of
alexander
and
deep
down
under
the
lover
s
the
author
felt
a
faint
twinge
of
mortified
vanity
when
susy
leaping
to
her
feet
cried
out
ravenously
and
without
preamble
oh
nick
nick
let
me
see
how
much
they
ve
given
you
he
flourished
the
cheque
before
her
in
the
firelight
a
couple
of
hundred
you
mercenary
wretch
oh
oh
she
gasped
as
if
the
good
news
had
been
almost
too
much
for
her
tense
nerves
and
then
surprised
him
by
dropping
to
the
ground
and
burying
her
face
against
his
knees
susy
my
susy
he
whispered
his
hand
on
her
shaking
shoulder
why
dear
what
is
it
you
re
not
crying
oh
nick
nick
two
hundred
two
hundred
dollars
then
i
ve
got
to
tell
you
oh
now
at
once
a
faint
chill
ran
over
him
and
involuntarily
his
hand
drew
back
from
her
bowed
figure
now
oh
why
now
he
protested
what
on
earth
does
it
matter
now
whatever
it
is
but
it
does
matter
it
matters
more
than
you
can
think
she
straightened
herself
still
kneeling
before
him
and
lifted
her
head
so
that
the
firelight
behind
her
turned
her
hair
into
a
ruddy
halo
oh
nick
the
bracelet
ellie
s
bracelet
i
ve
never
returned
it
to
her
she
faltered
out
he
felt
himself
recoiling
under
the
hands
with
which
she
clutched
his
knees
for
an
instant
he
did
not
remember
what
she
alluded
to
it
was
the
mere
mention
of
ellie
vanderlyn
s
name
that
had
fallen
between
them
like
an
icy
shadow
what
an
incorrigible
fool
he
had
been
to
think
they
could
ever
shake
off
such
memories
or
cease
to
be
the
slaves
of
such
a
past
the
bracelet
oh
yes
he
said
suddenly
understanding
and
feeling
the
chill
mount
slowly
to
his
lips
yes
the
bracelet
oh
nick
i
meant
to
give
it
back
at
once
i
did
i
did
but
the
day
you
went
away
i
forgot
everything
else
and
when
i
found
the
thing
in
the
bottom
of
my
bag
weeks
afterward
i
thought
everything
was
over
between
you
and
me
and
i
had
begun
to
see
ellie
again
and
she
was
kind
to
me
and
how
could
i
to
save
his
life
he
could
have
found
no
answer
and
she
pressed
on
and
so
this
morning
when
i
saw
you
were
frightened
by
the
expense
of
bringing
all
the
children
with
us
and
when
i
felt
i
couldn
t
leave
them
and
couldn
t
leave
you
either
i
remembered
the
bracelet
and
i
sent
you
off
to
telephone
while
i
rushed
round
the
corner
to
a
little
jeweller
s
where
i
d
been
before
and
pawned
it
so
that
you
shouldn
t
have
to
pay
for
the
children
but
now
darling
you
see
if
you
ve
got
all
that
money
i
can
get
it
out
of
pawn
at
once
can
t
i
and
send
it
back
to
her
she
flung
her
arms
about
him
and
he
held
her
fast
wondering
if
the
tears
he
felt
were
hers
or
his
still
he
did
not
speak
but
as
he
clasped
her
close
she
added
with
an
irrepressible
flash
of
her
old
irony
not
that
ellie
will
understand
why
i
ve
done
it
she
s
never
yet
been
able
to
make
out
why
you
returned
her
for
a
long
time
she
continued
to
lean
against
him
her
head
on
his
knees
as
she
had
done
on
the
terrace
of
como
on
the
last
night
of
their
honeymoon
she
had
ceased
to
talk
and
he
sat
silent
also
passing
his
hand
quietly
to
and
fro
over
her
hair
the
first
rapture
had
been
succeeded
by
soberer
feelings
her
confession
had
broken
up
the
frozen
pride
about
his
heart
and
humbled
him
to
the
earth
but
it
had
also
roused
forgotten
things
memories
and
scruples
swept
aside
in
the
first
rush
of
their
reunion
he
and
she
belonged
to
each
other
for
always
he
understood
that
now
the
impulse
which
had
first
drawn
them
together
again
in
spite
of
reason
in
spite
of
themselves
almost
that
instinctive
need
that
each
had
of
the
other
would
never
again
wholly
let
them
go
yet
as
he
sat
there
he
thought
of
strefford
he
thought
of
coral
hicks
he
had
been
a
coward
in
regard
to
coral
and
susy
had
been
sincere
and
courageous
in
regard
to
strefford
yet
his
mind
dwelt
on
coral
with
tenderness
with
compunction
with
remorse
and
he
was
almost
sure
that
susy
had
already
put
strefford
utterly
out
of
her
mind
it
was
the
old
contrast
between
the
two
ways
of
loving
the
man
s
way
and
the
woman
s
and
after
a
moment
it
seemed
to
nick
natural
enough
that
susy
from
the
very
moment
of
finding
him
again
should
feel
neither
pity
nor
regret
and
that
strefford
should
already
be
to
her
as
if
he
had
never
been
after
all
there
was
something
providential
in
such
arrangements
he
stooped
closer
pressed
her
dreaming
head
between
his
hands
and
whispered
wake
up
it
s
she
rose
but
as
she
moved
away
to
turn
on
the
light
he
caught
her
hand
and
drew
her
to
the
window
they
leaned
on
the
sill
in
the
darkness
and
through
the
clouds
from
which
a
few
drops
were
already
falling
the
moon
labouring
upward
swam
into
a
space
of
sky
cast
her
troubled
glory
on
them
and
was
again
hidden
