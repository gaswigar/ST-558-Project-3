the

to
be
an

and
not
a

work
part
one
chapter
one
when
miss
descended
from
the
twopenny
bus
as
it
drew
up
she
gathered
her
trim
skirt
about
her
with
neatness
and
decorum
being
well
used
to
getting
in
and
out
of
twopenny
buses
and
to
making
her
way
across
muddy
london
streets
a
woman
whose
suit
must
last
two
or
three
years
soon
learns
how
to
protect
it
from
splashes
and
how
to
aid
it
to
retain
the
freshness
of
its
folds
during
her
trudging
about
this
morning
in
the
wet
emily
had
been
very
careful
and
in
fact
was
returning
to
mortimer
street
as
unspotted
as
she
had
left
it
she
had
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
her
dress
this
particular
faithful
one
which
she
had
already
worn
through
a
twelvemonth
skirts
had
made
one
of
their
appalling
changes
and
as
she
walked
down
regent
street
and
bond
street
she
had
stopped
at
the
windows
of
more
than
one
shop
bearing
the
sign
ladies
tailor
and
and
had
looked
at
the
tautly
attired
preternaturally
slim
models
her
large
honest
hazel
eyes
wearing
an
anxious
expression
she
was
trying
to
discover
seams
were
to
be
placed
and
how
gathers
were
to
be
hung
or
if
there
were
to
be
gathers
at
all
or
if
one
had
to
be
bereft
of
every
seam
in
a
style
so
unrelenting
as
to
forbid
the
possibility
of
the
honest
and
struggling
with
the
problem
of
remodelling
last
season
skirt
at
all
as
it
is
only
quite
an
ordinary
brown
she
had
murmured
to
herself
i
might
be
able
to
buy
a
yard
or
so
to
match
it
and
i
be
able
to
join
the
gore
near
the
pleats
at
the
back
so
that
it
would
not
be
seen
she
quite
beamed
as
she
reached
the
happy
conclusion
she
was
such
a
simple
creature
that
it
took
but
little
to
brighten
the
aspect
of
life
for
her
and
to
cause
her
to
break
into
her
childlike
smile
a
little
kindness
from
any
one
a
little
pleasure
or
a
little
comfort
made
her
glow
with
enjoyment
as
she
got
out
of
the
bus
and
picked
up
her
rough
brown
skirt
prepared
to
tramp
bravely
through
the
mud
of
mortimer
street
to
her
lodgings
she
was
positively
radiant
it
was
not
only
her
smile
which
was
childlike
her
face
itself
was
childlike
for
a
woman
of
her
age
and
size
she
was
and
a
creature
with
fine
square
shoulders
and
a
long
small
waist
and
good
hips
she
was
a
big
woman
but
carried
herself
well
and
having
solved
the
problem
of
obtaining
through
marvels
of
energy
and
management
one
good
dress
a
year
wore
it
so
well
and
changed
her
old
ones
so
dexterously
that
she
always
looked
rather
smartly
dressed
she
had
nice
round
fresh
cheeks
and
nice
big
honest
eyes
plenty
of
hair
and
a
short
straight
nose
she
was
striking
and
and
her
plenitude
of
interest
in
everybody
and
her
pleasure
in
everything
out
of
which
pleasure
could
be
wrested
gave
her
big
eyes
a
fresh
look
which
made
her
seem
rather
like
a
nice
overgrown
girl
than
a
mature
woman
whose
life
was
a
continuous
struggle
with
the
narrowest
of
mean
fortunes
she
was
a
woman
of
good
blood
and
of
good
education
as
the
education
of
such
women
goes
she
had
few
relatives
and
none
of
them
had
any
intention
of
burdening
themselves
with
her
pennilessness
they
were
people
of
excellent
family
but
had
quite
enough
to
do
to
keep
their
sons
in
the
army
or
navy
and
find
husbands
for
their
daughters
when
emily
mother
had
died
and
her
small
annuity
had
died
with
her
none
of
them
had
wanted
the
care
of
a
big
girl
and
emily
had
had
the
situation
frankly
explained
to
her
at
eighteen
she
had
begun
to
work
as
assistant
teacher
in
a
small
school
the
year
following
she
had
taken
a
place
as
then
she
had
been
to
an
unpleasant
old
woman
in
northumberland
the
old
woman
had
lived
in
the
country
and
her
relatives
had
hovered
over
her
like
vultures
awaiting
her
decease
the
household
had
been
gloomy
and
gruesome
enough
to
have
driven
into
melancholy
madness
any
girl
not
of
the
sanest
and
most
temperament
emily
had
endured
it
with
an
unfailing
good
nature
which
at
last
had
actually
awakened
in
the
breast
of
her
mistress
a
ray
of
human
feeling
when
the
old
woman
at
length
died
and
emily
was
to
be
turned
out
into
the
world
it
was
revealed
that
she
had
been
left
a
legacy
of
a
few
hundred
pounds
and
a
letter
containing
some
rather
practical
if
harshly
expressed
advice
go
back
to
london
maytham
had
written
in
her
feeble
crabbed
hand
you
are
not
clever
enough
to
do
anything
remarkable
in
the
way
of
earning
your
living
but
you
are
so
that
you
can
make
yourself
useful
to
a
lot
of
helpless
creatures
who
will
pay
you
a
trifle
for
looking
after
them
and
the
affairs
they
are
too
lazy
or
too
foolish
to
manage
for
themselves
you
might
get
on
to
one
of
the
to
answer
ridiculous
questions
about
or
or
freckles
you
know
the
kind
of
thing
i
mean
you
might
write
notes
or
do
accounts
and
shopping
for
some
lazy
woman
you
are
a
practical
honest
creature
and
you
have
good
manners
i
have
often
thought
that
you
had
just
the
kind
of
commonplace
gifts
that
a
host
of
commonplace
people
want
to
find
at
their
service
an
old
servant
of
mine
who
lives
in
mortimer
street
would
probably
give
you
cheap
decent
lodgings
and
behave
well
to
you
for
my
sake
she
has
reason
to
be
fond
of
me
tell
her
i
sent
you
to
her
and
that
she
must
take
you
in
for
ten
shillings
a
week
emily
wept
for
gratitude
and
ever
afterward
enthroned
old
maytham
on
an
altar
as
a
princely
and
sainted
benefactor
though
after
she
had
invested
her
legacy
she
got
only
twenty
pounds
a
year
from
it
it
was
so
of
her
she
used
to
say
with
heartfelt
humbleness
of
spirit
i
never
of
her
doing
such
a
generous
thing
i
a
of
a
claim
upon
her
not
a
it
was
her
way
to
express
her
honest
emotions
with
emphasis
which
italicised
as
it
were
her
outpourings
of
pleasure
or
appreciation
she
returned
to
london
and
presented
herself
to
the
cupp
had
indeed
reason
to
remember
her
mistress
gratefully
at
a
time
when
youth
and
indiscreet
affection
had
betrayed
her
disastrously
she
had
been
saved
from
open
disgrace
and
taken
care
of
by
maytham
the
old
lady
who
had
then
been
a
vigorous
woman
had
made
the
soldier
lover
marry
his
despairing
sweetheart
and
when
he
had
promptly
drunk
himself
to
death
she
had
set
her
up
in
a
which
had
thriven
and
enabled
her
to
support
herself
and
her
daughter
decently
in
the
second
story
of
her
respectable
dingy
house
there
was
a
small
room
which
she
went
to
some
trouble
to
furnish
up
for
her
dead
mistress
friend
it
was
made
into
a
with
the
aid
of
a
cot
which
emily
herself
bought
and
disguised
decently
as
a
couch
during
the
daytime
by
means
of
a
red
and
blue
como
blanket
the
one
window
of
the
room
looked
out
upon
a
black
little
and
a
sooty
wall
on
which
thin
cats
crept
stealthily
or
sat
and
mournfully
gazed
at
fate
the
como
rug
played
a
large
part
in
the
decoration
of
the
apartment
one
of
them
with
a
piece
of
tape
run
through
a
hem
hung
over
the
door
in
the
character
of
a
another
covered
a
corner
which
was
miss
sole
wardrobe
as
she
began
to
get
work
the
cheerful
aspiring
creature
bought
herself
a
kensington
as
red
as
kensington
art
would
permit
it
to
be
she
covered
her
chairs
with
cotton
frilling
them
round
the
seats
over
her
cheap
white
muslin
curtains
eight
and
eleven
a
pair
at
robson
she
hung
draperies
she
bought
a
cheap
cushion
at
one
of
sales
and
some
bits
of
art
china
for
her
narrow
mantelpiece
a
lacquered
and
a
of
a
single
cup
and
saucer
a
plate
and
a
teapot
made
her
feel
herself
almost
sumptuous
after
a
day
spent
in
trudging
about
in
the
wet
or
cold
of
the
streets
doing
other
people
shopping
or
searching
for
dressmakers
or
characters
for
her
patrons
she
used
to
think
of
her
with
joyful
anticipation
cupp
always
had
a
bright
fire
glowing
in
her
tiny
grate
when
she
came
in
and
when
her
lamp
was
lighted
under
its
shade
of
crimson
japanese
paper
its
cheerful
air
combining
itself
with
the
singing
of
her
little
fat
black
kettle
on
the
hob
seemed
absolute
luxury
to
a
tired
damp
woman
cupp
and
jane
cupp
were
very
kind
and
attentive
to
her
no
one
who
lived
in
the
same
house
with
her
could
have
helped
liking
her
she
gave
so
little
trouble
and
was
so
expansively
pleased
by
any
attention
that
the
cupps
who
were
sometimes
rather
bullied
and
snubbed
by
the
professionals
who
generally
occupied
their
other
rooms
quite
loved
her
sometimes
the
professionals
extremely
smart
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
did
turns
at
the
balls
or
played
small
parts
at
theatres
were
irregular
in
their
payments
or
went
away
leaving
bills
behind
them
but
miss
payments
were
as
regular
as
saturday
night
and
in
fact
there
had
been
times
when
luck
being
against
her
emily
had
gone
extremely
hungry
during
a
whole
week
rather
than
buy
her
lunches
at
the
ladies
with
the
money
that
would
pay
her
rent
in
the
honest
minds
of
the
cupps
she
had
become
a
sort
of
possession
of
which
they
were
proud
she
seemed
to
bring
into
their
dingy
a
touch
of
the
great
world
that
world
whose
people
lived
in
mayfair
and
had
where
they
entertained
parties
for
the
shooting
and
the
hunting
and
in
which
also
existed
the
maids
and
matrons
who
on
cold
spring
mornings
sat
amid
billows
of
satin
and
tulle
and
lace
surrounded
with
nodding
plumes
waiting
shivering
for
hours
in
their
carriages
that
they
might
at
last
enter
buckingham
palace
and
be
admitted
to
the
cupp
knew
that
miss
was
well
connected
she
knew
that
she
possessed
an
aunt
with
a
title
though
her
ladyship
never
took
the
slightest
notice
of
her
niece
jane
cupp
took
modern
society
and
now
and
then
had
the
pleasure
of
reading
aloud
to
her
young
man
little
incidents
concerning
some
castle
or
manor
in
which
miss
aunt
lady
malfry
was
staying
with
earls
and
special
favorites
of
the
prince
jane
also
knew
that
miss
occasionally
sent
letters
addressed
to
the
right
honourable
the
countess
of
and
received
replies
stamped
with
coronets
once
even
a
letter
had
arrived
adorned
with
an
incident
which
cupp
and
jane
had
discussed
with
deep
interest
over
their
hot
and
tea
emily
however
was
far
from
making
any
professions
of
grandeur
as
time
went
on
she
had
become
fond
enough
of
the
cupps
to
be
quite
frank
with
them
about
her
connections
with
these
grand
people
the
countess
had
heard
from
a
friend
that
miss
had
once
found
her
an
excellent
governess
and
she
had
commissioned
her
to
find
for
her
a
reliable
young
ladies
she
had
done
some
secretarial
work
for
a
charity
of
which
the
duchess
was
patroness
in
fact
these
people
knew
her
only
as
a
woman
who
for
a
modest
remuneration
would
make
herself
extremely
useful
in
numberless
practical
ways
she
knew
much
more
of
them
than
they
knew
of
her
and
in
her
affectionate
admiration
for
those
who
treated
her
with
human
kindness
sometimes
spoke
to
cupp
or
jane
of
their
beauty
or
charity
with
a
very
nice
ingenuous
feeling
naturally
some
of
her
patrons
grew
fond
of
her
and
as
she
was
a
fine
handsome
young
woman
with
a
perfectly
correct
bearing
they
gave
her
little
pleasures
inviting
her
to
tea
or
luncheon
or
taking
her
to
the
theatre
her
enjoyment
of
these
things
was
so
frank
and
grateful
that
the
cupps
counted
them
among
their
own
joys
jane
cupp
who
knew
something
of
dressmaking
felt
it
a
brilliant
thing
to
be
called
upon
to
renovate
an
old
dress
or
help
in
the
making
of
a
new
one
for
some
festivity
the
cupps
thought
their
tall
lodger
something
of
a
beauty
and
when
they
had
helped
her
to
dress
for
the
evening
baring
her
fine
big
white
neck
and
arms
and
adorning
her
thick
braids
of
hair
with
some
sparkling
trembling
ornaments
after
putting
her
in
her
cab
they
used
to
go
back
to
their
kitchen
and
talk
about
her
and
wonder
that
some
gentleman
who
wanted
a
handsome
stylish
woman
at
the
head
of
his
table
did
not
lay
himself
and
his
fortune
at
her
feet
in
the
in
regent
street
you
see
many
a
lady
in
a
coronet
that
has
half
the
good
looks
she
has
cupp
remarked
frequently
she
got
a
nice
complexion
and
a
fine
head
of
hair
and
if
you
ask
she
got
as
nice
a
pair
of
clear
eyes
as
a
lady
could
have
then
look
at
her
figure
her
neck
and
her
waist
that
kind
of
big
long
throat
of
hers
would
set
off
rows
of
pearls
or
diamonds
beautiful
she
a
lady
born
too
for
all
her
simple
way
and
she
a
sweet
creature
if
ever
there
was
one
for
and
i
never
saw
her
equal
miss
had
patrons
as
well
as
noble
ones
in
fact
those
of
the
middle
class
were
far
more
numerous
than
the
duchesses
so
it
had
been
possible
for
her
to
do
more
than
one
good
turn
for
the
cupp
household
she
had
got
sewing
in
maida
vale
and
bloomsbury
for
jane
cupp
many
a
time
and
cupp
floor
had
been
occupied
for
years
by
a
young
man
emily
had
been
able
to
recommend
her
own
appreciation
of
good
turns
made
her
eager
to
do
them
for
others
she
never
let
slip
a
chance
to
help
any
one
in
any
way
it
was
a
thing
done
by
one
of
her
patrons
who
liked
her
which
made
her
so
radiant
as
she
walked
through
the
mud
this
morning
she
was
inordinately
fond
of
the
country
and
having
had
what
she
called
a
bad
winter
she
had
not
seen
the
remotest
chance
of
getting
out
of
town
at
all
during
the
summer
months
the
weather
was
beginning
to
be
unusually
hot
and
her
small
red
room
which
seemed
so
cosy
in
winter
was
shut
in
by
a
high
wall
from
all
chance
of
breezes
occasionally
she
lay
and
panted
a
little
in
her
cot
and
felt
that
when
all
the
private
omnibuses
loaded
with
trunks
and
servants
had
rattled
away
and
deposited
their
burdens
at
the
various
stations
life
in
town
would
be
rather
lonely
every
one
she
knew
would
have
gone
somewhere
and
mortimer
street
in
august
was
a
melancholy
thing
and
lady
maria
had
actually
invited
her
to
mallowe
what
a
piece
of
good
fortune
what
an
extraordinary
piece
of
kindness
she
did
not
know
what
a
source
of
entertainment
she
was
to
lady
maria
and
how
the
shrewd
worldly
old
thing
liked
her
lady
maria
bayne
was
the
cleverest
smartest
old
woman
in
london
she
knew
everybody
and
had
done
everything
in
her
youth
a
good
many
things
not
considered
highly
proper
a
certain
royal
duke
had
been
much
pleased
with
her
and
people
had
said
some
very
nasty
things
about
it
but
this
had
not
hurt
lady
maria
she
knew
how
to
say
nasty
things
herself
and
as
she
said
them
wittily
they
were
usually
listened
to
and
repeated
emily
had
gone
to
her
first
to
write
notes
for
an
hour
every
evening
she
had
sent
declined
and
accepted
invitations
and
put
off
charities
and
dull
people
she
wrote
a
fine
dashing
hand
and
had
a
intelligence
and
knowledge
of
things
lady
maria
began
to
depend
on
her
and
to
find
that
she
could
be
sent
on
errands
and
depended
on
to
do
a
number
of
things
consequently
she
was
often
at
south
audley
street
and
once
when
lady
maria
was
suddenly
taken
ill
and
was
horribly
frightened
about
herself
emily
was
such
a
comfort
to
her
that
she
kept
her
for
three
weeks
the
creature
is
so
cheerful
and
perfectly
free
from
vice
that
she
a
relief
her
ladyship
said
to
her
nephew
afterward
so
many
women
are
affected
cats
she
go
out
and
buy
you
a
box
of
pills
or
a
porous
plaster
but
at
the
same
time
she
has
a
kind
of
simplicity
and
freedom
from
spites
and
envies
which
might
be
the
natural
thing
for
a
princess
so
it
happened
that
occasionally
emily
put
on
her
best
dress
and
most
carefully
built
hat
and
went
to
south
audley
street
to
tea
sometimes
she
had
previously
gone
in
buses
to
some
remote
place
in
the
city
to
buy
a
special
tea
of
which
there
had
been
rumours
she
met
some
very
smart
people
and
rarely
any
stupid
ones
lady
maria
being
incased
in
a
perfect
frank
armour
of
selfishness
which
would
have
been
capable
of
burning
dulness
at
the
stake
i
wo
have
dull
people
she
used
to
say
i
dull
myself
when
emily
went
to
her
on
the
morning
in
which
this
story
opens
she
found
her
consulting
her
and
making
lists
i
arranging
my
parties
for
mallowe
she
said
rather
crossly
how
tiresome
it
is
the
people
one
wants
at
the
same
time
are
always
nailed
to
the
opposite
ends
of
the
earth
and
then
things
are
found
out
about
people
and
one
ca
have
them
till
it
blown
over
those
ridiculous
dexters
they
were
the
nicest
possible
pair
both
of
them
and
both
of
them
ready
to
flirt
with
anybody
but
there
was
too
much
flirting
i
suppose
good
heavens
if
i
could
have
a
scandal
and
keep
it
quiet
i
would
have
a
scandal
at
all
come
and
help
me
emily
emily
sat
down
beside
her
you
see
it
is
my
early
august
party
said
her
ladyship
rubbing
her
delicate
little
old
nose
with
her
pencil
and
walderhurst
is
coming
to
me
it
always
amuses
me
to
have
walderhurst
the
moment
a
man
like
that
comes
into
a
room
the
women
begin
to
frisk
about
and
swim
and
languish
except
those
who
try
to
get
up
interesting
conversations
they
think
likely
to
attract
his
attention
they
all
think
it
is
possible
that
he
may
marry
them
if
he
were
a
mormon
he
might
have
marchionesses
of
walderhurst
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
i
suppose
said
emily
that
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
his
first
wife
and
will
never
marry
again
he
was
in
love
with
her
any
more
than
he
was
in
love
with
his
housemaid
he
knew
he
must
marry
and
thought
it
very
annoying
as
the
child
died
i
believe
he
thinks
it
his
duty
to
marry
again
but
he
hates
it
he
rather
dull
and
he
ca
bear
women
fussing
about
and
wanting
to
be
made
love
to
they
went
over
the
and
discussed
people
and
dates
seriously
the
list
was
made
and
the
notes
written
before
emily
left
the
house
it
was
not
until
she
had
got
up
and
was
buttoning
her
coat
that
lady
maria
bestowed
her
boon
emily
she
said
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
mallowe
on
the
i
want
you
to
help
me
to
take
care
of
people
and
keep
them
from
boring
me
and
one
another
though
i
do
mind
their
boring
one
another
half
so
much
as
i
mind
their
boring
me
i
want
to
be
able
to
go
off
and
take
my
nap
at
any
hour
i
choose
i
will
entertain
people
what
you
can
do
is
to
lead
them
off
to
gather
things
or
look
at
church
towers
i
hope
you
come
emily
face
flushed
rosily
and
her
eyes
opened
and
sparkled
o
lady
maria
you
kind
she
said
you
know
how
i
should
enjoy
it
i
have
heard
so
much
of
mallowe
every
one
says
it
is
so
beautiful
and
that
there
are
no
such
gardens
in
england
they
are
good
gardens
my
husband
was
rather
mad
about
roses
the
best
train
for
you
to
take
is
the
from
paddington
that
will
bring
you
to
the
court
just
in
time
for
tea
on
the
lawn
emily
could
have
kissed
lady
maria
if
they
had
been
on
the
terms
which
lead
people
to
make
demonstrations
of
affection
but
she
would
have
been
quite
as
likely
to
kiss
the
butler
when
he
bent
over
her
at
dinner
and
murmured
in
dignified
confidence
port
or
sherry
miss
bibsworth
would
have
been
no
more
astonished
than
lady
maria
would
and
bibsworth
certainly
would
have
expired
of
disgust
and
horror
she
was
so
happy
when
she
hailed
the
twopenny
bus
that
when
she
got
into
it
her
face
was
beaming
with
the
delight
which
adds
freshness
and
good
looks
to
any
woman
to
think
that
such
good
luck
had
come
to
her
to
think
of
leaving
her
hot
little
room
behind
her
and
going
as
a
guest
to
one
of
the
most
beautiful
old
houses
in
england
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
live
for
a
while
quite
naturally
the
life
the
fortunate
people
lived
year
after
year
to
be
a
part
of
the
beautiful
order
and
picturesqueness
and
dignity
of
it
to
sleep
in
a
lovely
bedroom
to
be
called
in
the
morning
by
a
perfect
housemaid
to
have
one
early
tea
served
in
a
delicate
cup
and
to
listen
as
one
drank
it
to
the
birds
singing
in
the
trees
in
the
park
she
had
an
ingenuous
appreciation
of
the
simplest
material
joys
and
the
fact
that
she
would
wear
her
nicest
clothes
every
day
and
dress
for
dinner
every
evening
was
a
delightful
thing
to
reflect
upon
she
got
so
much
more
out
of
life
than
most
people
though
she
was
not
aware
of
it
she
opened
the
front
door
of
the
house
in
mortimer
street
with
her
and
went
upstairs
almost
unconscious
that
the
damp
heat
was
dreadful
she
met
jane
cupp
coming
down
and
smiled
at
her
happily
jane
she
said
if
you
are
not
busy
i
should
like
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
will
you
come
into
my
room
yes
miss
jane
replied
with
her
usual
respectful
lady
maid
air
it
was
in
truth
jane
highest
ambition
to
become
some
day
maid
to
a
great
lady
and
she
privately
felt
that
her
association
with
miss
was
the
best
possible
training
she
used
to
ask
to
be
allowed
to
dress
her
when
she
went
out
and
had
felt
it
a
privilege
to
be
permitted
to
do
her
hair
she
helped
emily
to
remove
her
walking
dress
and
neatly
folded
away
her
gloves
and
veil
she
knelt
down
before
her
as
soon
as
she
saw
her
seat
herself
to
take
off
her
muddy
boots
oh
you
jane
emily
exclaimed
with
her
kind
italicised
manner
that
good
of
you
i
tired
really
but
such
a
nice
thing
has
happened
i
have
had
such
a
delightful
invitation
for
the
first
week
in
august
i
sure
you
enjoy
it
miss
said
jane
it
so
hot
in
august
lady
maria
bayne
has
been
kind
enough
to
invite
me
to
mallowe
court
explained
emily
smiling
down
at
the
cheap
slipper
jane
was
putting
on
her
large
foot
she
was
built
on
a
large
scale
and
her
foot
was
of
no
proportions
o
miss
exclaimed
jane
how
beautiful
i
was
reading
about
mallowe
in
society
the
other
day
and
it
said
it
was
lovely
and
her
ladyship
parties
were
wonderful
for
smartness
the
paragraph
was
about
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
he
is
lady
maria
cousin
said
emily
and
he
will
be
there
when
i
am
she
was
a
friendly
creature
and
lived
a
life
so
really
isolated
from
any
ordinary
companionship
that
her
simple
little
talks
with
jane
and
cupp
were
a
pleasure
to
her
the
cupps
were
neither
gossiping
nor
intrusive
and
she
felt
as
if
they
were
her
friends
once
when
she
had
been
ill
for
a
week
she
remembered
suddenly
realising
that
she
had
no
intimates
at
all
and
that
if
she
died
cupp
and
jane
would
certainly
be
the
last
faces
and
the
only
ones
she
would
see
she
had
cried
a
little
the
night
she
thought
of
it
but
then
as
she
told
herself
she
was
feverish
and
weak
and
it
made
her
morbid
it
was
because
of
this
invitation
that
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
jane
she
went
on
you
see
we
shall
have
to
begin
to
contrive
about
dresses
yes
indeed
miss
it
fortunate
that
the
summer
sales
are
on
it
i
saw
some
beautiful
colored
linens
yesterday
they
were
so
cheap
and
they
do
make
up
so
smart
for
the
country
then
you
got
your
new
tussore
with
the
blue
collar
and
waistband
it
does
become
you
i
must
say
i
think
that
a
tussore
always
looks
fresh
said
emily
and
i
saw
a
really
nice
little
tan
toque
one
of
those
soft
straw
ones
for
three
and
eleven
and
just
a
twist
of
blue
chiffon
and
a
wing
would
make
it
look
quite
she
was
very
clever
with
her
fingers
and
often
did
excellent
things
with
a
bit
of
chiffon
and
a
wing
or
a
few
yards
of
linen
or
muslin
and
a
remnant
of
lace
picked
up
at
a
sale
she
and
jane
spent
quite
a
happy
afternoon
in
careful
united
contemplation
of
the
resources
of
her
limited
wardrobe
they
found
that
the
brown
skirt
be
altered
and
with
the
addition
of
new
and
collar
and
a
of
lace
at
the
neck
would
look
quite
fresh
a
black
net
evening
dress
which
a
patron
had
given
her
the
year
before
could
be
remodelled
and
touched
up
delightfully
her
fresh
face
and
her
square
white
shoulders
were
particularly
adorned
by
black
there
was
a
white
dress
which
could
be
sent
to
the
cleaner
and
an
old
pink
one
whose
superfluous
breadths
could
be
combined
with
lace
and
achieve
wonders
indeed
i
think
i
shall
be
very
well
off
for
said
emily
nobody
expects
me
to
change
often
every
one
knows
if
they
notice
at
all
she
did
not
know
she
was
and
of
an
angelic
contentedness
of
spirit
in
fact
she
did
not
find
herself
interested
in
contemplation
of
her
own
qualities
but
in
contemplation
and
admiration
of
those
of
other
people
it
was
necessary
to
provide
emily
with
food
and
lodging
and
such
a
wardrobe
as
would
be
just
sufficient
credit
to
her
more
fortunate
acquaintances
she
worked
hard
to
attain
this
modest
end
and
was
quite
satisfied
she
found
at
the
shops
where
the
summer
sales
were
being
held
a
couple
of
cotton
frocks
to
which
her
height
and
her
small
long
waist
gave
an
air
of
actual
elegance
a
sailor
hat
with
a
smart
ribbon
and
quill
a
few
new
trifles
for
her
neck
a
bow
a
silk
handkerchief
daringly
knotted
and
some
fresh
gloves
made
her
feel
that
she
was
sufficiently
equipped
during
her
last
expedition
to
the
sales
she
came
upon
a
nice
white
duck
coat
and
skirt
which
she
contrived
to
buy
as
a
present
for
jane
it
was
necessary
to
count
over
the
contents
of
her
purse
very
carefully
and
to
give
up
the
purchase
of
a
slim
umbrella
she
wanted
but
she
did
it
cheerfully
if
she
had
been
a
rich
woman
she
would
have
given
presents
to
every
one
she
knew
and
it
was
actually
a
luxury
to
her
to
be
able
to
do
something
for
the
cupps
who
she
always
felt
were
continually
giving
her
more
than
she
paid
for
the
care
they
took
of
her
small
room
the
fresh
hot
tea
they
managed
to
have
ready
when
she
came
in
the
penny
bunch
of
daffodils
they
sometimes
put
on
her
table
were
kindnesses
and
she
was
grateful
for
them
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
jane
she
said
to
the
girl
when
she
got
into
the
cab
on
the
eventful
day
of
her
journey
to
mallowe
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
you
i
sure
i
feel
so
smart
in
my
dress
now
that
you
have
altered
it
if
lady
maria
maid
ever
thinks
of
leaving
her
i
am
sure
i
could
recommend
you
for
her
place
chapter
two
there
were
other
visitors
to
mallowe
court
travelling
by
the
from
paddington
but
they
were
much
smarter
people
than
miss
and
they
were
put
into
a
carriage
by
a
footman
with
a
cockade
and
a
long
drab
coat
emily
who
traveled
third
with
some
workmen
with
bundles
looked
out
of
her
window
as
they
passed
and
might
possibly
have
breathed
a
faint
sigh
if
she
had
not
felt
in
such
buoyant
spirits
she
had
put
on
her
revived
brown
skirt
and
a
white
linen
blouse
with
a
brown
dot
on
it
a
soft
brown
silk
tie
was
knotted
smartly
under
her
fresh
collar
and
she
wore
her
new
sailor
hat
her
gloves
were
brown
and
so
was
her
parasol
she
looked
nice
and
taut
and
fresh
but
notably
inexpensive
the
people
who
went
to
sales
and
bought
things
at
three
and
eleven
or
a
yard
would
have
been
able
add
her
up
and
work
out
her
total
but
there
would
be
no
people
capable
of
the
calculation
at
mallowe
even
the
servants
hall
was
likely
to
know
less
of
prices
than
this
one
guest
did
the
people
the
footman
escorted
to
the
carriage
were
a
mother
and
daughter
the
mother
had
regular
little
features
and
would
have
been
pretty
if
she
had
not
been
much
too
plump
she
wore
an
extremely
smart
and
a
wonderful
of
cool
pale
thin
silk
she
was
not
an
elegant
person
but
her
appointments
were
luxurious
and
her
daughter
was
pretty
and
had
a
slim
swaying
waist
soft
pink
cheeks
and
a
pouting
mouth
her
large
of
straw
with
its
big
gauze
bow
and
crushed
roses
had
a
slightly
exaggerated
parisian
air
it
is
a
little
too
picturesque
emily
thought
but
how
lovely
she
looks
in
it
i
suppose
it
was
so
becoming
she
could
not
help
buying
it
i
sure
it
virot
as
she
was
looking
at
the
girl
admiringly
a
man
passed
her
window
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
square
face
as
he
passed
close
to
emily
he
stared
through
her
head
as
if
she
had
been
transparent
or
invisible
he
got
into
the
next
to
her
when
the
train
arrived
at
mallowe
station
he
was
one
of
the
first
persons
who
got
out
two
of
lady
maria
men
were
waiting
on
the
platform
emily
recognised
their
liveries
one
met
the
tall
man
touching
his
hat
and
followed
him
to
a
high
cart
in
the
shafts
of
which
a
splendid
mare
was
fretting
and
dancing
in
a
few
moments
the
arrival
was
on
the
high
seat
the
footman
behind
and
the
mare
speeding
up
the
road
miss
found
herself
following
the
second
footman
and
the
mother
and
daughter
who
were
being
taken
to
the
landau
waiting
outside
the
station
the
footman
piloted
them
merely
touching
his
hat
quickly
to
emily
being
fully
aware
that
she
could
take
care
of
herself
this
she
did
promptly
looking
after
her
box
and
seeing
it
safe
in
the
mallowe
omnibus
when
she
reached
the
landau
the
two
other
visitors
were
in
it
she
got
in
and
in
entire
contentment
sat
down
with
her
back
to
the
horses
the
mother
and
daughter
wore
for
a
few
minutes
a
somewhat
uneasy
air
they
were
evidently
sociable
persons
but
were
not
quite
sure
how
to
begin
a
conversation
with
an
as
yet
unintroduced
lady
who
was
going
to
stay
at
the
country
house
to
which
they
were
themselves
invited
emily
herself
solved
the
problem
producing
her
commonplace
with
a
friendly
tentative
smile
is
it
a
lovely
country
she
said
it
perfect
answered
the
mother
i
never
visited
europe
before
and
the
english
country
seems
to
me
just
exquisite
we
have
a
summer
place
in
america
but
the
country
is
quite
different
she
was
and
disposed
to
talk
and
with
emily
genial
assistance
conversation
flowed
before
they
were
to
mallowe
it
had
revealed
itself
that
they
were
from
cincinnati
and
after
a
winter
spent
in
paris
largely
devoted
to
visits
to
paquin
doucet
and
virot
they
had
taken
a
house
in
mayfair
for
the
season
their
name
was
brooke
emily
thought
she
remembered
hearing
of
them
as
people
who
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
and
went
incessantly
to
parties
always
in
new
and
lovely
clothes
the
girl
had
been
presented
by
the
american
minister
and
had
had
a
sort
of
success
because
she
dressed
and
danced
exquisitely
she
was
the
kind
of
american
girl
who
ended
by
marrying
a
title
she
had
sparkling
eyes
and
a
delicate
nose
but
even
emily
guessed
that
she
was
an
astute
little
person
have
you
ever
been
to
mallowe
court
before
she
inquired
no
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
it
it
is
so
beautiful
do
you
know
lady
maria
very
well
i
known
her
about
three
years
she
has
been
very
kind
to
me
well
i
should
have
taken
her
for
a
particularly
kind
person
too
sharp
emily
amiably
smiled
she
so
clever
she
replied
do
you
know
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
asked
brooke
no
answered
miss
she
had
no
part
in
that
portion
of
lady
maria
life
which
was
illumined
by
cousins
who
were
marquises
lord
walderhurst
did
not
drop
in
to
afternoon
tea
he
kept
himself
for
special
did
you
see
the
man
who
drove
away
in
the
high
cart
brooke
continued
with
a
touch
of
fevered
interest
cora
thought
it
must
be
the
marquis
the
servant
who
met
him
wore
the
same
livery
as
the
man
up
there
with
a
nod
toward
the
box
it
was
one
of
lady
maria
servants
said
emily
i
have
seen
him
in
south
audley
street
and
lord
walderhurst
was
to
be
at
mallowe
lady
maria
mentioned
it
there
mother
exclaimed
cora
well
of
course
if
he
is
to
be
there
it
will
make
it
interesting
returned
her
mother
in
a
tone
in
which
lurked
an
admission
of
relief
emily
wondered
if
she
had
wanted
to
go
somewhere
else
and
had
been
firmly
directed
toward
mallowe
by
her
daughter
we
heard
a
great
deal
of
him
in
london
this
season
brooks
went
on
miss
cora
brooke
laughed
we
heard
that
at
least
half
a
dozen
people
were
determined
to
marry
him
she
remarked
with
pretty
scorn
i
should
think
that
to
meet
a
girl
who
was
indifferent
might
be
good
for
him
do
be
too
indifferent
cora
said
her
mother
with
ingenuous
ineptness
it
was
a
very
stupid
bit
of
revelation
and
miss
brooke
eyes
flashed
if
emily
had
been
a
sharp
woman
she
would
have
observed
that
if
the
of
indifferent
and
piquant
young
person
could
be
made
dangerous
to
lord
walderhurst
it
would
be
made
so
during
this
visit
the
man
was
in
peril
from
this
beauty
from
cincinnati
and
her
rather
indiscreet
mother
though
upon
the
whole
the
indiscreet
maternal
parent
might
unconsciously
form
his
protection
but
emily
only
laughed
amiably
as
at
a
humorous
remark
she
was
ready
to
accept
almost
anything
as
humour
well
he
be
a
great
match
for
any
girl
she
said
he
is
so
rich
you
know
he
is
very
rich
when
they
reached
mallowe
and
were
led
out
upon
the
lawn
where
the
tea
was
being
served
under
embowering
trees
they
found
a
group
of
guests
eating
little
hot
cakes
and
holding
teacups
in
their
hands
there
were
several
young
women
and
one
of
them
a
very
tall
very
fair
girl
with
large
eyes
as
blue
as
and
with
a
lovely
limp
and
long
blue
frock
of
the
same
shade
had
been
one
of
the
beauties
of
the
past
season
she
was
a
lady
agatha
slade
and
emily
began
to
admire
her
at
once
she
felt
her
to
be
a
sort
of
added
boon
bestowed
by
kind
fate
upon
herself
it
was
so
delightful
that
she
should
be
of
this
particular
this
lovely
creature
whom
she
had
only
known
previously
through
pictures
in
ladies
illustrated
papers
if
it
should
occur
to
her
to
wish
to
become
the
marchioness
of
walderhurst
what
could
possibly
prevent
the
consummation
of
her
desire
surely
not
lord
walderhurst
himself
if
he
was
human
she
was
standing
leaning
lightly
against
the
trunk
of
an
and
a
borzoi
was
standing
close
to
her
resting
his
long
delicate
head
against
her
gown
encouraging
the
caresses
of
her
fair
stroking
hand
she
was
in
this
attractive
pose
when
lady
maria
turned
in
her
seat
and
said
there
walderhurst
the
man
who
had
driven
himself
over
from
the
station
in
the
cart
was
coming
towards
them
across
the
grass
he
was
past
middle
life
and
plain
but
was
of
good
height
and
had
an
air
it
was
perhaps
on
the
whole
rather
an
air
of
knowing
what
he
wanted
emily
who
by
that
time
was
comfortably
seated
in
a
cushioned
sipping
her
own
cup
of
tea
gave
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
when
she
wondered
if
he
was
not
really
distinguished
and
he
was
really
neither
but
was
and
and
had
good
eyes
about
the
colour
of
his
hair
among
these
amiably
worldly
people
who
were
not
in
the
least
moved
by
an
altruistic
prompting
emily
greatest
capital
consisted
in
the
fact
that
she
did
not
expect
to
be
taken
the
least
notice
of
she
was
not
aware
that
it
was
her
capital
because
the
fact
was
so
wholly
a
part
of
the
simple
contentedness
of
her
nature
that
she
had
not
thought
about
it
at
all
the
truth
was
that
she
found
all
her
entertainment
and
occupation
in
being
an
audience
or
a
spectator
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
notice
that
when
the
guests
were
presented
to
him
lord
walderhurst
barely
glanced
at
her
surface
as
he
bowed
and
could
scarcely
be
said
to
forget
her
existence
the
next
second
because
he
had
hardly
gone
to
the
length
of
recognising
it
as
she
enjoyed
her
extremely
nice
cup
of
tea
and
little
buttered
scone
she
also
enjoyed
looking
at
his
lordship
discreetly
and
trying
to
make
an
innocent
summing
up
of
his
mental
attitudes
lady
maria
seemed
to
like
him
and
to
be
pleased
to
see
him
he
himself
seemed
in
an
undemonstrative
way
to
like
lady
maria
he
also
was
evidently
glad
to
get
his
tea
and
enjoyed
it
as
he
sat
at
his
side
he
did
not
pay
very
much
attention
to
any
one
else
emily
was
slightly
disappointed
to
see
that
he
did
not
glance
at
the
beauty
and
the
borzoi
more
than
twice
and
then
that
his
examination
seemed
as
much
for
the
borzoi
as
for
the
beauty
she
could
not
help
also
observing
that
since
he
had
joined
the
circle
it
had
become
more
animated
so
far
at
least
as
the
female
members
were
concerned
she
could
not
help
remembering
lady
maria
remark
about
the
effect
he
produced
on
women
when
he
entered
a
room
several
interesting
or
sparkling
speeches
had
already
been
made
there
was
a
little
more
laughter
and
chattiness
which
somehow
it
seemed
to
be
quite
open
to
lord
walderhurst
to
enjoy
though
it
was
not
exactly
addressed
to
him
miss
cora
brooke
however
devoted
herself
to
a
young
man
in
white
flannels
with
an
air
of
tennis
about
him
she
sat
a
little
apart
and
talked
to
him
in
a
voice
soft
enough
to
even
exclude
lord
walderhurst
presently
she
and
her
companion
got
up
and
sauntered
away
they
went
down
the
broad
flight
of
ancient
stone
steps
which
led
to
the
lying
in
full
view
below
the
lawn
there
they
began
to
play
tennis
miss
brooke
skimmed
and
darted
about
like
a
swallow
the
swirl
of
her
lace
petticoats
was
most
attractive
that
girl
ought
not
to
play
tennis
in
shoes
with
ridiculous
heels
remarked
lord
walderhurst
she
will
spoil
the
court
lady
maria
broke
into
a
little
chuckle
she
wanted
to
play
at
this
particular
moment
she
said
and
as
she
has
only
just
arrived
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
come
out
to
tea
in
she
spoil
the
court
all
the
same
said
the
marquis
what
clothes
it
amazing
how
girls
dress
now
i
wish
i
had
such
clothes
answered
lady
maria
and
she
chuckled
again
she
got
beautiful
feet
she
got
louis
quinze
heels
returned
his
lordship
at
all
events
emily
thought
miss
brooke
seemed
to
intend
to
rather
keep
out
of
his
way
and
to
practise
no
delicate
allurements
when
her
was
at
an
end
she
sauntered
about
the
lawn
and
terraces
with
her
companion
tilting
her
parasol
prettily
over
her
shoulder
so
that
it
formed
an
entrancing
background
to
her
face
and
head
she
seemed
to
be
entertaining
the
young
man
his
big
laugh
and
the
silver
music
of
her
own
lighter
merriment
rang
out
a
little
tantalisingly
i
wonder
what
cora
is
saying
said
brooke
to
the
group
at
large
she
always
makes
men
laugh
so
emily
felt
an
interest
herself
the
merriment
sounded
so
attractive
she
wondered
if
perhaps
to
a
man
who
had
been
so
much
run
after
a
girl
who
took
no
notice
of
his
presence
and
amused
other
men
so
much
might
not
assume
an
agreeable
aspect
but
he
took
more
notice
of
lady
agatha
slade
than
of
any
one
else
that
evening
she
was
placed
next
to
him
at
dinner
and
she
really
was
radiant
to
look
upon
in
palest
green
chiffon
she
had
an
exquisite
little
head
with
soft
hair
piled
with
wondrous
lightness
upon
it
and
her
long
little
neck
swayed
like
the
stem
of
a
flower
she
was
lovely
enough
to
arouse
in
the
beholder
mind
the
anticipation
of
her
being
silly
but
she
was
not
silly
at
all
lady
maria
commented
upon
that
fact
to
miss
when
they
met
in
her
bedroom
late
that
night
lady
maria
liked
to
talk
and
be
talked
to
for
half
an
hour
after
the
day
was
over
and
emily
admiring
interest
in
all
she
said
she
found
at
once
stimulating
and
soothing
her
ladyship
was
an
old
woman
who
indulged
and
inspired
herself
with
an
epicurean
wisdom
though
she
would
not
have
stupid
people
about
her
she
did
not
always
want
very
clever
ones
they
give
me
too
much
exercise
she
said
the
epigrammatic
ones
keep
me
always
jumping
over
fences
besides
i
like
to
make
all
the
epigrams
myself
emily
struck
a
happy
mean
and
she
was
a
genuine
admirer
she
was
intelligent
enough
not
to
spoil
the
point
of
an
epigram
when
she
repeated
it
and
she
might
be
relied
upon
to
repeat
it
and
give
all
the
glory
to
its
originator
lady
maria
knew
there
were
people
who
hearing
your
good
things
appropriated
them
without
a
scruple
she
said
a
number
of
good
things
to
emily
in
summing
up
her
guests
and
their
characteristics
walderhurst
has
been
to
me
three
times
when
i
made
sure
that
he
would
not
escape
without
a
new
marchioness
attached
to
him
i
should
think
he
would
take
one
to
put
an
end
to
the
annoyance
of
dangling
unplucked
upon
the
bough
a
man
in
his
position
if
he
has
character
enough
to
choose
can
prevent
even
his
wife
being
a
nuisance
he
can
give
her
a
good
house
hang
the
family
diamonds
on
her
supply
a
decent
elderly
woman
as
a
sort
of
and
turn
her
into
the
paddock
to
kick
up
her
heels
within
the
limits
of
decorum
his
own
rooms
can
be
sacred
to
him
he
has
his
clubs
and
his
personal
interests
husbands
and
wives
annoy
each
other
very
little
in
these
days
married
life
has
become
comparatively
decent
i
should
think
his
wife
might
be
very
happy
commented
emily
he
looks
very
kind
i
do
know
whether
he
is
kind
or
not
it
has
never
been
necessary
for
me
to
borrow
money
from
him
lady
maria
was
capable
of
saying
odd
things
in
her
refined
little
drawling
voice
he
more
respectable
than
most
men
of
his
age
the
diamonds
are
magnificent
and
he
not
only
has
three
superb
places
but
has
money
enough
to
keep
them
up
now
there
are
three
aspirants
at
mallowe
in
the
present
party
of
course
you
can
guess
who
they
are
emily
emily
almost
blushed
she
felt
a
little
indelicate
lady
agatha
would
be
very
suitable
she
said
and
ralph
is
very
clever
of
course
and
miss
brooke
is
really
pretty
lady
maria
gave
vent
to
her
small
chuckle
ralph
is
the
kind
of
woman
who
means
business
she
corner
walderhurst
and
talk
literature
and
roll
her
eyes
at
him
until
he
hates
her
these
writing
women
who
are
intensely
pleased
with
themselves
if
they
have
some
good
looks
into
the
bargain
believe
themselves
capable
of
marrying
any
one
ralph
has
fine
eyes
and
rolls
them
walderhurst
wo
be
ogled
the
brooke
girl
is
sharper
than
ralph
she
was
very
sharp
this
afternoon
she
began
at
once
i
i
did
see
her
wondering
yes
you
did
but
you
did
understand
the
tennis
and
the
laughing
with
young
heriot
on
the
terrace
she
is
going
to
be
the
piquant
young
woman
who
aggravates
by
indifference
and
disdains
rank
and
splendour
the
kind
of
girl
who
has
her
innings
in
novelettes
but
not
out
of
them
the
successful
women
are
those
who
know
how
to
toady
in
the
right
way
and
not
obviously
walderhurst
has
far
too
good
an
opinion
of
himself
to
be
attracted
by
a
girl
who
is
making
up
to
another
man
he
not
emily
was
reminded
in
spite
of
herself
of
plaint
do
be
too
indifferent
cora
she
did
not
want
to
recall
it
exactly
because
she
thought
the
brookes
agreeable
and
would
have
preferred
to
think
them
disinterested
but
after
all
she
reflected
how
natural
that
a
girl
who
was
so
pretty
should
feel
that
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
represented
prospects
chiefly
however
she
was
filled
with
admiration
at
lady
maria
cleverness
how
wonderfully
you
observe
everything
lady
maria
she
exclaimed
how
wonderfully
i
have
had
seasons
in
london
that
a
good
many
you
know
seasons
of
débutantes
and
mothers
tend
toward
enlightenment
now
there
is
agatha
slade
poor
girl
she
of
a
kind
i
know
by
heart
with
birth
and
beauty
she
is
perfectly
helpless
her
people
are
poor
enough
to
be
entitled
to
aid
from
the
charity
organisation
and
they
have
had
the
indecency
to
present
themselves
with
six
daughters
six
all
with
delicate
skins
and
delicate
little
noses
and
heavenly
eyes
most
men
ca
afford
them
and
they
ca
afford
most
men
as
soon
as
agatha
begins
to
go
off
a
little
she
will
have
to
step
aside
if
she
has
not
married
the
others
must
be
allowed
their
chance
agatha
has
had
the
advertising
of
the
illustrated
papers
this
season
and
she
has
gone
well
in
these
days
a
new
beauty
is
advertised
like
a
new
soap
they
have
given
them
in
the
streets
but
that
is
about
all
that
has
been
denied
them
but
agatha
has
not
had
any
special
offer
and
i
know
both
she
and
her
mother
are
a
little
frightened
alix
must
come
out
next
season
and
they
ca
afford
frocks
for
two
agatha
will
have
to
be
sent
to
their
place
in
ireland
and
to
be
sent
to
castle
clare
is
almost
like
being
sent
to
the
bastille
she
never
get
out
alive
she
have
to
stay
there
and
see
herself
grow
thin
instead
of
slim
and
colourless
instead
of
fair
her
little
nose
will
grow
sharp
and
she
will
lose
her
hair
by
degrees
oh
emily
gave
forth
sympathetically
what
a
pity
that
would
be
i
thought
i
really
thought
lord
walderhurst
seemed
to
admire
her
oh
every
one
admires
her
for
that
matter
but
if
they
go
no
further
that
will
not
save
her
from
the
bastille
poor
thing
there
emily
we
must
go
to
bed
we
have
talked
enough
chapter
three
to
awaken
in
a
still
delicious
room
with
the
summer
morning
sunshine
breaking
softly
into
it
through
leafy
greenness
was
a
delightful
thing
to
miss
who
was
accustomed
to
opening
her
eyes
upon
four
walls
covered
with
cheap
paper
to
the
sound
of
outside
hammerings
and
the
rattle
and
heavy
roll
of
wheels
in
a
building
at
the
back
of
her
there
lived
a
man
whose
occupation
beginning
early
in
the
morning
involved
banging
of
a
persistent
nature
she
awakened
to
her
first
day
at
mallowe
stretching
herself
luxuriously
with
the
smile
of
a
child
she
was
so
thankful
for
the
softness
of
her
bed
and
so
delighted
with
the
lovely
freshness
of
her
room
as
she
lay
upon
her
pillow
she
could
see
the
boughs
of
the
trees
and
hear
the
chatter
of
darting
starlings
when
her
morning
tea
was
brought
it
seemed
like
nectar
to
her
she
was
a
perfectly
healthy
woman
with
a
palate
as
unspoiled
as
that
of
a
child
in
the
nursery
her
enjoyment
of
all
things
was
so
normal
as
to
be
in
her
day
and
time
an
absolute
abnormality
she
rose
and
dressed
at
once
eager
for
the
open
air
and
sunshine
she
was
out
upon
the
lawn
before
any
one
else
but
the
borzoi
which
rose
from
beneath
a
tree
and
came
with
stately
walk
toward
her
the
air
was
exquisite
the
broad
beautiful
stretch
of
view
lay
warm
in
the
sun
the
masses
of
flowers
on
the
herbaceous
borders
showed
leaves
and
adorned
with
glittering
drops
of
dew
she
walked
across
the
spacious
sweep
of
sod
and
gazed
enraptured
at
the
country
spread
out
below
she
could
have
kissed
the
soft
white
sheep
dotting
the
fields
and
lying
in
gentle
huddled
groups
under
the
trees
the
darlings
she
said
in
a
little
effusive
outburst
she
talked
to
the
dog
and
fondled
him
he
seemed
to
understand
her
mood
and
pressed
close
against
her
gown
when
she
stopped
they
walked
together
about
the
gardens
and
presently
picked
up
an
exuberant
retriever
which
bounded
and
wriggled
and
at
once
settled
into
a
steady
trot
beside
them
emily
adored
the
flowers
as
she
walked
by
their
beds
and
at
intervals
stopped
to
bury
her
face
in
bunches
of
spicy
things
she
was
so
happy
that
the
joy
in
her
hazel
eyes
was
pathetic
she
was
startled
as
she
turned
into
a
rather
narrow
to
see
lord
walderhurst
coming
toward
her
he
looked
exceedingly
clean
in
his
fresh
light
knickerbocker
suit
which
was
rather
becoming
to
him
a
gardener
was
walking
behind
evidently
gathering
roses
for
him
which
he
put
into
a
shallow
basket
emily
cast
about
for
a
suitable
remark
to
make
if
he
should
chance
to
stop
to
speak
to
her
she
consoled
herself
with
the
thought
that
there
were
things
she
really
to
say
about
the
beauty
of
the
gardens
and
certain
clumps
of
campanulas
which
seemed
made
a
feature
of
in
the
herbaceous
borders
it
was
so
much
nicer
not
to
be
obliged
to
invent
observations
but
his
lordship
did
not
stop
to
speak
to
her
he
was
interested
in
his
roses
which
she
heard
afterward
were
to
be
sent
to
town
to
an
invalid
friend
and
as
she
drew
near
he
turned
aside
to
speak
to
the
gardener
as
emily
was
just
passing
him
when
he
turned
again
and
as
the
passage
was
narrow
he
found
himself
unexpectedly
gazing
into
her
face
being
nearly
the
same
height
they
were
so
near
each
other
that
it
was
a
little
awkward
i
beg
pardon
he
said
stepping
back
a
pace
and
lifting
his
straw
hat
but
he
did
not
say
i
beg
pardon
miss
and
emily
knew
that
he
had
not
recognised
her
again
and
had
not
the
remotest
idea
who
she
was
or
where
she
came
from
she
passed
him
with
her
agreeable
friendly
smile
and
there
returned
to
her
mind
lady
maria
remarks
of
the
night
before
to
think
that
if
he
married
poor
pretty
lady
agatha
she
will
be
mistress
of
three
places
quite
as
beautiful
as
mallowe
three
lovely
old
houses
three
sets
of
gardens
with
thousands
of
flowers
to
bloom
every
year
how
nice
it
would
be
for
her
she
is
so
lovely
that
it
seems
as
if
he
fall
in
love
with
her
then
if
she
was
marchioness
of
walderhurst
she
could
do
so
much
for
her
sisters
after
breakfast
she
spent
her
morning
in
doing
a
hundred
things
for
lady
maria
she
wrote
notes
for
her
and
helped
her
to
arrange
plans
for
the
entertainment
of
her
visitors
she
was
very
busy
and
happy
in
the
afternoon
she
drove
across
the
moor
to
maundell
a
village
on
the
other
side
of
it
she
really
went
on
an
errand
for
her
hostess
but
as
she
was
fond
of
driving
and
the
brown
cob
was
a
beauty
she
felt
that
she
was
being
given
a
treat
on
a
level
with
the
rest
of
her
ladyship
generous
hospitalities
she
drove
well
and
her
straight
strong
figure
showed
to
much
advantage
on
the
high
seat
of
the
cart
lord
walderhurst
himself
commented
on
her
as
he
saw
her
drive
away
she
has
a
nice
flat
straight
back
that
woman
he
remarked
to
lady
maria
what
is
her
name
one
never
hears
people
names
when
one
is
introduced
her
name
is
emily
her
ladyship
answered
and
she
a
nice
creature
that
would
be
an
inhuman
thing
to
say
to
most
men
but
if
one
is
a
thoroughly
selfish
being
and
has
some
knowledge
of
one
own
character
one
sees
that
a
nice
creature
might
be
a
nice
companion
you
are
quite
right
was
lady
maria
reply
as
she
held
up
her
lorgnette
and
watched
the
cart
spin
down
the
avenue
i
am
selfish
myself
and
i
realise
that
is
the
reason
why
emily
is
becoming
the
lodestar
of
my
existence
there
is
such
comfort
in
being
pandered
to
by
a
person
who
is
not
even
aware
that
she
is
pandering
she
suspect
that
she
is
entitled
to
thanks
for
it
that
evening
ralph
came
shining
to
dinner
in
amber
satin
which
seemed
to
possess
some
quality
of
stimulating
her
to
brilliance
she
was
witty
enough
to
collect
an
audience
and
lord
walderhurst
was
drawn
within
it
this
was
ralph
evening
when
the
men
returned
to
the
she
secured
his
lordship
at
once
and
managed
to
keep
him
she
was
a
woman
who
could
talk
pretty
well
and
perhaps
lord
walderhurst
was
amused
emily
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
was
but
at
least
he
listened
lady
agatha
slade
looked
a
little
listless
and
pale
lovely
as
she
was
she
did
not
always
collect
an
audience
and
this
evening
she
said
she
had
a
headache
she
actually
crossed
the
room
and
taking
a
seat
by
miss
emily
began
to
talk
to
her
about
lady
which
she
had
taken
up
emily
was
so
gratified
that
she
found
conversation
easy
she
did
not
realise
that
at
that
particular
moment
she
was
a
most
agreeable
and
comforting
companion
for
agatha
slade
she
had
heard
so
much
of
her
beauty
during
the
season
and
remembered
so
many
little
things
that
a
girl
who
was
a
thought
depressed
might
like
to
hear
referred
to
again
sometimes
to
agatha
the
balls
where
people
had
collected
in
groups
to
watch
her
dancing
the
flattering
speeches
she
had
heard
the
dazzling
hopes
which
had
been
raised
seemed
a
little
unreal
as
if
after
all
they
could
have
been
only
dreams
this
was
particularly
so
of
course
when
life
had
dulled
for
a
while
and
the
atmosphere
of
unpaid
bills
became
heavy
at
home
it
was
so
because
the
girl
had
received
a
long
anxious
letter
from
her
mother
in
which
much
was
said
of
the
importance
of
an
early
preparation
for
the
presentation
of
alix
who
had
really
been
kept
back
a
year
and
was
in
fact
nearer
twenty
than
nineteen
if
we
were
not
in
debrett
and
burke
one
might
be
reserved
about
such
matters
poor
lady
claraway
wrote
but
what
is
one
to
do
when
all
the
world
can
buy
one
daughters
ages
at
the
miss
had
seen
lady
agatha
portrait
at
the
academy
and
the
way
in
which
people
had
crowded
about
it
she
had
chanced
to
hear
comments
also
and
she
agreed
with
a
number
of
persons
who
had
not
thought
the
picture
did
the
original
justice
sir
bruce
norman
was
standing
by
me
with
an
elderly
lady
the
first
time
i
saw
it
she
said
as
she
turned
a
new
row
of
the
big
scarf
her
hostess
was
knitting
for
a
fisherman
charity
he
really
looked
quite
annoyed
i
heard
him
say
is
not
good
at
all
she
is
far
far
lovelier
her
eyes
are
like
blue
flowers
the
moment
i
saw
you
i
found
myself
looking
at
your
eyes
i
hope
i
did
seem
rude
lady
agatha
smiled
she
had
flushed
delicately
and
took
up
in
her
slim
hand
a
skein
of
the
white
wool
there
are
some
people
who
are
never
rude
she
sweetly
said
and
you
are
one
of
them
i
am
sure
that
knitting
looks
nice
i
wonder
if
i
could
make
a
comforter
for
a
fisherman
if
it
would
amuse
you
to
try
emily
answered
i
will
begin
one
for
you
lady
maria
has
several
pairs
of
wooden
needles
shall
i
do
please
how
kind
of
you
in
a
pause
of
her
conversation
ralph
a
little
later
looked
across
the
room
at
emily
bending
over
lady
agatha
and
the
knitting
as
she
gave
her
instructions
what
a
creature
that
is
she
said
lord
walderhurst
lifted
his
monocle
and
inserted
it
in
his
unillumined
eye
he
also
looked
across
the
room
emily
wore
the
black
evening
dress
which
gave
such
opportunities
to
her
square
white
shoulders
and
firm
column
of
throat
the
country
air
and
sun
had
deepened
the
colour
on
her
cheek
and
the
light
of
the
nearest
lamp
fell
kindly
on
the
big
twist
of
her
hair
and
burnished
it
she
looked
soft
and
warm
and
so
generously
interested
in
her
pupil
progress
that
she
was
rather
sweet
lord
walderhurst
simply
looked
at
her
he
was
a
man
of
but
few
words
women
who
were
sprightly
found
him
somewhat
unresponsive
in
fact
he
was
aware
that
a
man
in
his
position
need
not
exert
himself
the
women
themselves
would
talk
they
wanted
to
talk
because
they
wanted
him
to
hear
them
ralph
talked
she
is
the
most
primeval
person
i
know
she
accepts
her
fate
without
a
trace
of
resentment
she
simply
accepts
it
what
is
her
fate
asked
lord
walderhurst
still
gazing
in
his
unbiassed
manner
through
his
monocle
and
not
turning
his
head
as
he
spoke
it
is
her
fate
to
be
a
woman
who
is
perfectly
well
born
and
who
is
as
penniless
as
a
charwoman
and
works
like
one
she
is
at
the
beck
and
call
of
any
one
who
will
give
her
an
odd
job
to
earn
a
meal
with
that
is
one
of
the
new
ways
women
have
found
of
making
a
living
good
skin
remarked
lord
walderhurst
irrelevantly
good
hair
quite
a
lot
she
has
some
of
the
nicest
blood
in
england
in
her
veins
and
she
engaged
my
last
cook
for
me
said
ralph
hope
she
was
a
good
cook
very
emily
has
a
faculty
of
finding
decent
people
i
believe
it
is
because
she
is
so
decent
herself
with
a
little
laugh
looks
quite
decent
commented
walderhurst
the
knitting
was
getting
on
famously
it
was
odd
you
should
see
sir
bruce
norman
that
day
agatha
slade
was
saying
it
must
have
been
just
before
he
was
called
away
to
india
it
was
he
sailed
the
next
day
i
happen
to
know
because
some
friends
of
mine
met
me
only
a
few
yards
from
your
picture
and
began
to
talk
about
him
i
had
not
known
before
that
he
was
so
rich
i
had
not
heard
about
his
collieries
in
lancashire
oh
opening
her
big
eyes
in
yearning
how
i
wish
i
owned
a
colliery
it
must
be
so
to
be
rich
i
never
was
rich
answered
lady
agatha
with
a
bitter
little
sigh
i
know
it
is
hideous
to
be
poor
never
was
rich
said
emily
and
i
never
shall
be
you
a
little
shyly
are
so
different
lady
agatha
flushed
delicately
again
emily
made
a
gentle
joke
you
have
eyes
like
blue
flowers
she
said
lady
agatha
lifted
the
eyes
like
blue
flowers
and
they
were
pathetic
oh
she
gave
forth
almost
impetuously
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
it
does
not
matter
whether
one
has
eyes
or
not
it
was
a
pleasure
to
emily
to
realise
that
after
this
the
beauty
seemed
to
be
rather
drawn
toward
her
their
acquaintance
became
almost
a
sort
of
intimacy
over
the
wool
scarf
for
the
fisherman
which
was
taken
up
and
laid
down
and
even
carried
out
on
the
lawn
and
left
under
the
trees
for
the
footmen
to
restore
when
they
brought
in
the
rugs
and
cushions
lady
maria
was
amusing
herself
with
the
making
of
knitted
scarfs
and
helmets
just
now
and
bits
of
white
or
gray
knitting
were
the
fashion
at
mallowe
once
agatha
brought
hers
to
emily
room
in
the
afternoon
to
ask
that
a
dropped
stitch
might
be
taken
up
and
this
established
a
sort
of
precedent
afterward
they
began
to
exchange
visits
the
strenuousness
of
things
was
becoming
in
fact
almost
too
much
for
lady
agatha
most
unpleasant
things
were
happening
at
home
and
occasionally
castle
clare
loomed
up
grayly
in
the
distance
like
a
spectre
certain
tradespeople
who
ought
in
lady
claraway
opinion
to
have
kept
quiet
and
waited
in
patience
until
things
became
better
were
becoming
hideously
persistent
in
view
of
the
fact
that
alix
next
season
must
be
provided
for
it
was
most
awkward
a
girl
could
not
be
presented
and
properly
launched
in
the
world
in
a
way
which
would
give
her
a
proper
chance
without
expenditure
to
the
claraways
expenditure
meant
credit
and
there
were
blots
as
of
tears
on
the
letters
in
which
lady
claraway
reiterated
that
the
tradespeople
were
behaving
horribly
sometimes
she
said
once
in
desperation
things
looked
as
if
they
would
all
be
obliged
to
shut
themselves
up
in
castle
clare
to
retrench
and
then
what
was
to
become
of
alix
and
her
season
and
there
were
millicent
and
hilda
and
eve
more
than
once
there
was
the
mist
of
tears
in
the
eyes
when
lady
agatha
came
to
talk
confidence
between
two
women
establishes
itself
through
processes
at
once
subtle
and
simple
emily
could
not
have
told
when
she
first
began
to
know
that
the
beauty
was
troubled
and
distressed
lady
agatha
did
not
know
when
she
first
slipped
into
making
little
frank
speeches
about
herself
but
these
things
came
about
agatha
found
something
like
comfort
in
her
acquaintance
with
the
big
normal
artless
creature
something
which
actually
raised
her
spirits
when
she
was
depressed
emily
paid
constant
kindly
tribute
to
her
charms
and
helped
her
to
believe
in
them
when
she
was
with
her
agatha
always
felt
that
she
really
was
lovely
after
all
and
that
loveliness
was
a
great
capital
emily
admired
and
revered
it
so
and
evidently
never
dreamed
of
doubting
its
omnipotence
she
used
to
talk
as
if
any
girl
who
was
a
beauty
was
a
potential
duchess
in
fact
this
was
a
thing
she
quite
ingenuously
believed
she
had
not
lived
in
a
world
where
marriage
was
a
thing
of
romance
and
for
that
matter
neither
had
agatha
it
was
nice
if
a
girl
liked
the
man
who
married
her
but
if
he
was
a
agreeable
person
of
good
means
it
was
natural
that
she
would
end
by
liking
him
sufficiently
and
to
be
provided
for
comfortably
or
luxuriously
for
life
and
not
left
upon
one
own
hands
or
one
parents
was
a
thing
to
be
thankful
for
in
any
case
it
was
such
a
relief
to
everybody
to
know
that
a
girl
was
settled
and
especially
it
was
such
a
relief
to
the
girl
herself
even
novels
and
plays
were
no
longer
of
entrancing
young
men
and
captivating
young
women
who
fell
in
love
with
each
other
in
the
first
chapter
and
after
increasingly
picturesque
incidents
were
married
in
the
last
one
in
the
absolute
surety
of
being
blissfully
happy
forevermore
neither
lady
agatha
nor
emily
had
been
brought
up
on
this
order
of
literature
nor
in
an
atmosphere
in
which
it
was
accepted
without
reservation
they
had
both
had
hard
lives
and
knew
what
lay
before
them
agatha
knew
she
must
make
a
marriage
or
fade
out
of
existence
in
prosaic
and
narrowed
dulness
emily
knew
that
there
was
no
prospect
for
her
of
desirable
marriage
at
all
she
was
too
poor
too
entirely
unsupported
by
social
surroundings
and
not
sufficiently
radiant
to
catch
the
roving
eye
to
be
able
to
maintain
herself
decently
to
be
given
an
occasional
treat
by
her
more
fortunate
friends
and
to
be
allowed
by
fortune
to
present
to
the
face
of
the
world
the
appearance
of
a
woman
who
was
not
a
pauper
was
all
she
could
expect
but
she
felt
that
lady
agatha
had
the
right
to
more
she
did
not
reason
the
matter
out
and
ask
herself
why
she
had
the
right
to
more
but
she
accepted
the
proposition
as
a
fact
she
was
ingenuously
interested
in
her
fate
and
affectionately
sympathetic
she
used
to
look
at
lord
walderhurst
quite
anxiously
at
times
when
he
was
talking
to
the
girl
an
anxious
mother
could
scarcely
have
regarded
him
with
a
greater
desire
to
analyse
his
sentiments
the
match
would
be
such
a
fitting
one
he
would
make
such
an
excellent
husband
and
there
were
three
places
and
the
diamonds
were
magnificent
lady
maria
had
described
to
her
a
certain
tiara
which
she
frequently
pictured
to
herself
as
glittering
above
agatha
exquisite
low
brow
it
would
be
infinitely
more
becoming
to
her
than
to
miss
brooke
or
ralph
though
either
of
them
would
have
worn
it
with
spirit
she
could
not
help
feeling
that
both
ralph
brilliancy
and
miss
brooke
insouciant
prettiness
were
not
unworthy
of
being
counted
in
the
running
but
lady
agatha
seemed
somehow
so
much
more
completely
the
thing
wanted
she
was
anxious
that
she
should
always
look
her
best
and
when
she
knew
that
disturbing
letters
were
fretting
her
and
saw
that
they
made
her
look
pale
and
less
luminous
she
tried
to
raise
her
spirits
suppose
we
take
a
brisk
walk
she
would
say
and
then
you
might
try
a
little
nap
you
look
a
little
tired
oh
said
agatha
one
day
how
kind
you
are
to
me
i
believe
you
actually
care
about
my
complexion
about
my
looking
well
lord
walderhurst
said
to
me
the
other
day
was
emily
angelically
tactful
answer
that
you
were
the
only
woman
he
had
ever
seen
who
looked
lovely
did
he
exclaimed
lady
agatha
and
flushed
sweetly
once
sir
bruce
norman
actually
said
that
to
me
i
told
him
it
was
the
nicest
thing
that
could
be
said
to
a
woman
it
is
all
the
nicer
with
a
sigh
because
it
is
true
i
am
sure
lord
walderhurst
believed
it
true
emily
said
he
is
not
a
man
who
talks
you
know
he
is
very
serious
and
dignified
she
had
herself
a
reverence
and
admiration
for
lord
walderhurst
bordering
on
tender
awe
he
was
indeed
a
person
of
whom
painful
things
were
not
said
he
also
conducted
himself
well
toward
his
tenantry
and
was
patron
of
several
notable
charities
to
the
unexacting
and
innocently
respectful
mind
of
emily
this
was
at
once
impressive
and
attractive
she
knew
though
not
intimately
many
noble
personages
quite
unlike
him
she
was
rather
early
victorian
and
touchingly
respectable
i
have
been
crying
confessed
lady
agatha
i
was
afraid
so
lady
agatha
said
emily
things
are
getting
hopeless
in
curzon
street
i
had
a
letter
from
millicent
this
morning
she
is
next
in
age
to
alix
and
she
says
oh
a
number
of
things
when
girls
see
everything
passing
by
them
it
makes
them
irritable
millicent
is
seventeen
and
she
is
too
lovely
her
hair
is
like
a
cloak
and
her
eyelashes
are
twice
as
long
as
mine
she
sighed
again
and
her
lips
which
were
like
curved
unconcealedly
quivered
they
were
so
cross
about
sir
bruce
norman
going
to
india
she
added
he
will
come
back
said
emily
benignly
but
he
may
be
too
late
has
he
ingenuously
seen
alix
agatha
flushed
oddly
this
time
her
delicate
skin
registered
every
emotion
exquisitely
he
has
seen
her
but
she
was
in
the
and
i
do
think
she
did
not
finish
but
stopped
uneasily
and
sat
and
gazed
out
of
the
open
window
into
the
park
she
did
not
look
happy
the
episode
of
sir
bruce
norman
was
brief
and
even
vague
it
had
begun
well
sir
bruce
had
met
the
beauty
at
a
ball
and
they
had
danced
together
more
than
once
sir
bruce
had
attractions
other
than
his
old
baronetcy
and
his
he
was
a
person
with
a
laughing
brown
eye
and
a
nice
wit
he
had
danced
charmingly
and
paid
gay
compliments
he
would
have
done
immensely
well
agatha
had
liked
him
emily
sometimes
thought
she
had
liked
him
very
much
her
mother
had
liked
him
and
had
thought
he
was
attracted
but
after
a
number
of
occasions
of
agreeable
meetings
they
had
encountered
each
other
on
the
lawn
at
goodwood
and
he
had
announced
that
he
was
going
to
india
forthwith
he
had
gone
and
emily
had
gathered
that
somehow
lady
agatha
had
been
considered
somewhat
to
blame
her
people
were
not
vulgar
enough
to
express
this
frankly
but
she
had
felt
it
her
younger
sisters
had
upon
the
whole
made
her
feel
it
most
it
had
been
borne
in
upon
her
that
if
alix
or
millicent
with
the
cloak
or
even
eve
who
was
a
gipsy
had
been
given
such
a
season
and
such
doucet
frocks
they
would
have
combined
them
with
their
wonderful
complexions
and
lovely
little
chins
and
noses
in
such
a
manner
as
would
at
least
have
prevented
desirable
acquaintances
from
feeling
free
to
take
and
steamers
to
bombay
in
her
letter
of
this
morning
millicent
temper
had
indeed
got
somewhat
the
better
of
her
taste
and
breeding
and
lovely
agatha
had
cried
large
tears
so
it
was
comforting
to
be
told
that
lord
walderhurst
had
said
such
an
extremely
amiable
thing
if
he
was
not
young
he
was
really
nice
and
there
were
exalted
persons
who
absolutely
had
rather
a
fad
for
him
it
would
be
exceptionally
brilliant
the
brisk
walk
was
taken
and
lady
agatha
returned
from
it
blooming
she
was
adorable
at
dinner
and
in
the
evening
gathered
an
actual
court
about
her
she
was
all
in
pink
and
a
wreath
of
little
pink
wild
roses
lay
close
about
her
head
making
her
with
her
tall
young
slimness
look
like
a
botticelli
nymph
emily
saw
that
lord
walderhurst
looked
at
her
a
great
deal
he
sat
on
an
extraordinarily
comfortable
corner
seat
and
stared
through
his
monocle
lady
maria
always
gave
her
emily
plenty
to
do
she
had
a
nice
taste
in
floral
arrangement
and
early
in
her
visit
it
had
fallen
into
her
hands
as
a
duty
to
do
the
flowers
the
next
morning
she
was
in
the
gardens
early
gathering
roses
with
the
dew
on
them
and
was
in
the
act
of
cutting
some
adorable
sharman
crawfords
when
she
found
it
behoved
her
to
let
down
her
carefully
tucked
up
petticoats
as
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
was
walking
straight
toward
her
an
instinct
told
her
that
he
wanted
to
talk
to
her
about
lady
agatha
slade
you
get
up
earlier
than
lady
agatha
he
remarked
after
he
had
wished
her
she
is
oftener
invited
to
the
country
than
i
am
she
answered
when
i
have
a
country
holiday
i
want
to
spend
every
moment
of
it
out
of
doors
and
the
mornings
are
so
lovely
they
are
not
like
this
in
mortimer
street
do
you
live
in
mortimer
street
yes
do
you
like
it
i
am
very
comfortable
i
am
fortunate
in
having
a
nice
landlady
she
and
her
daughter
are
very
kind
to
me
the
morning
was
indeed
heavenly
the
masses
of
flowers
were
drenched
with
dew
and
the
already
hot
sun
was
drawing
fragrance
from
them
and
filling
the
warm
air
with
it
the
marquis
with
his
monocle
fixed
looked
up
into
the
sky
and
among
the
trees
where
a
or
two
cooed
with
musical
softness
yes
he
observed
with
a
glance
which
swept
the
scene
it
is
different
from
mortimer
street
i
suppose
are
you
fond
of
the
country
oh
yes
sighed
emily
oh
yes
she
was
not
a
specially
articulate
person
she
could
not
have
conveyed
in
words
all
that
her
oh
yes
really
meant
of
simple
love
for
and
joy
in
rural
sights
and
sounds
and
scents
but
when
she
lifted
her
big
kind
hazel
eyes
to
him
the
earnestness
of
her
emotion
made
them
pathetic
as
the
unspeakableness
of
her
pleasures
often
did
lord
walderhurst
gazed
at
her
through
the
monocle
with
an
air
he
sometimes
had
of
taking
her
measure
without
either
unkindliness
or
particular
interest
is
lady
agatha
fond
of
the
country
he
inquired
she
is
fond
of
everything
that
is
beautiful
she
replied
her
nature
is
as
lovely
as
her
face
i
think
is
it
emily
walked
a
step
or
two
away
to
a
rose
climbing
up
the
wall
and
began
to
clip
off
blossoms
which
tumbled
sweetly
into
her
basket
she
seems
lovely
in
everything
she
said
in
disposition
and
manner
and
everything
she
never
seems
to
disappoint
one
or
make
mistakes
you
are
fond
of
her
she
has
been
so
kind
to
me
you
often
say
people
are
kind
to
you
emily
paused
and
felt
a
trifle
confused
realising
that
she
was
not
a
clever
person
and
being
a
modest
one
she
began
to
wonder
if
she
was
given
to
a
which
made
her
tiresome
she
blushed
up
to
her
ears
people
are
kind
she
said
hesitatingly
i
you
see
i
have
nothing
to
give
and
i
always
seem
to
be
receiving
what
luck
remarked
his
lordship
calmly
gazing
at
her
he
made
her
feel
rather
awkward
and
she
was
at
once
relieved
and
sorry
when
he
walked
away
to
join
another
early
riser
who
had
come
out
upon
the
lawn
for
some
mysterious
reason
emily
liked
him
perhaps
his
magnificence
and
the
constant
talk
she
had
heard
of
him
had
warmed
her
imagination
he
had
never
said
anything
particularly
intelligent
to
her
but
she
felt
as
if
he
had
he
was
a
rather
silent
man
but
never
looked
stupid
he
had
made
some
good
speeches
in
the
house
of
lords
not
brilliant
but
sound
and
of
a
dignified
respectability
he
had
also
written
two
pamphlets
emily
had
an
enormous
respect
for
intellect
and
frequently
it
must
be
admitted
for
the
thing
which
passed
for
it
she
was
not
exacting
during
her
stay
at
mallowe
in
the
summer
lady
maria
always
gave
a
village
treat
she
had
given
it
for
forty
years
and
it
was
a
lively
function
several
hundred
wildly
joyous
village
children
were
fed
to
repletion
with
exhilarating
buns
and
cake
and
tea
in
mugs
after
which
they
ran
races
for
prizes
and
were
entertained
in
various
ways
with
the
aid
of
such
of
the
as
were
benevolently
inclined
to
make
themselves
useful
everybody
was
not
so
inclined
though
people
always
thought
the
thing
amusing
nobody
objected
to
looking
on
and
some
were
agreeably
stimulated
by
the
general
sense
of
festivity
but
emily
was
found
by
lady
maria
to
be
invaluable
on
this
occasion
it
was
so
easy
without
the
least
sense
of
to
give
her
all
the
drudgery
to
do
there
was
plenty
of
drudgery
though
it
did
not
present
itself
to
emily
in
that
light
she
no
more
realised
that
she
was
giving
lady
maria
a
good
deal
for
her
money
so
to
speak
than
she
realised
that
her
ladyship
though
an
amusing
and
delightful
was
an
absolutely
selfish
and
inconsiderate
old
woman
so
long
as
emily
did
not
seem
obviously
tired
it
would
not
have
occurred
to
lady
maria
that
she
could
be
so
that
after
all
her
legs
and
arms
were
mere
human
flesh
and
blood
that
her
substantial
feet
were
subject
to
the
fatigue
unending
trudging
to
and
fro
induces
her
ladyship
was
simply
delighted
that
the
preparations
went
so
well
that
she
could
turn
to
emily
for
service
and
always
find
her
ready
emily
made
lists
and
calculations
she
worked
out
plans
and
made
purchases
she
interviewed
the
village
matrons
who
made
the
cake
and
buns
and
boiled
the
tea
in
bags
in
a
copper
she
found
the
women
who
could
be
engaged
to
assist
in
cutting
cake
and
and
helping
to
serve
it
she
ordered
the
putting
up
of
tents
and
forms
and
tables
the
innumerable
things
to
be
remembered
she
called
to
mind
really
emily
said
lady
maria
i
do
know
how
i
have
done
this
thing
for
forty
years
without
you
i
must
always
have
you
at
mallowe
for
the
treat
emily
was
of
the
genial
nature
which
rejoices
upon
even
small
occasions
and
is
invariably
stimulated
to
pleasure
by
the
festivities
of
others
the
festal
atmosphere
was
a
delight
to
her
in
her
numberless
errands
to
the
village
the
sight
of
the
excitement
in
the
faces
of
the
children
she
passed
on
her
way
to
this
cottage
and
that
filled
her
eyes
with
friendly
glee
and
wreathed
her
face
with
smiles
when
she
went
into
the
cottage
where
the
cake
was
being
baked
children
hovered
about
in
groups
and
nudged
each
other
giggling
they
hung
about
partly
through
thrilled
interest
and
partly
because
their
joy
made
them
eager
to
courtesy
to
her
as
she
came
out
the
obeisance
seeming
to
identify
them
even
more
closely
with
the
coming
treat
they
grinned
and
beamed
rosily
and
emily
smiled
at
them
and
nodded
uplifted
by
a
pleasure
almost
as
infantile
as
their
own
she
was
really
enjoying
herself
so
honestly
that
she
did
not
realise
how
hard
she
worked
during
the
days
before
the
festivity
she
was
really
ingenious
and
invented
a
number
of
new
methods
of
entertainment
it
was
she
who
with
the
aid
of
a
couple
of
gardeners
transformed
the
tents
into
bowers
of
green
boughs
and
arranged
the
decorations
of
the
tables
and
the
park
gates
what
a
lot
of
walking
you
do
lord
walderhurst
said
to
her
once
as
she
passed
the
group
on
the
lawn
do
you
know
how
many
hours
you
have
been
on
your
feet
i
like
it
she
answered
and
as
she
hurried
by
she
saw
that
he
was
sitting
a
shade
nearer
to
lady
agatha
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
sit
before
and
that
agatha
under
a
large
hat
of
white
gauze
frills
was
looking
like
a
seraph
so
sweet
and
shining
were
her
eyes
so
her
face
she
looked
actually
happy
perhaps
he
has
been
saying
things
emily
thought
how
happy
she
will
be
he
has
such
a
nice
pair
of
eyes
he
would
make
a
woman
very
happy
a
faint
sigh
fluttered
from
her
lips
she
was
beginning
to
be
physically
tired
and
was
not
yet
quite
aware
of
it
if
she
had
not
been
physically
tired
she
would
not
even
vaguely
have
had
at
this
moment
recalled
to
her
mind
the
fact
that
she
was
not
of
the
women
to
whom
things
are
said
and
to
whom
things
happen
emily
remarked
lady
maria
fanning
herself
as
it
was
frightfully
hot
has
the
most
admirable
effect
on
me
she
makes
me
feel
generous
i
should
like
to
present
her
with
the
smartest
things
from
the
wardrobes
of
all
my
relations
do
you
give
her
clothes
asked
walderhurst
i
have
any
to
spare
but
i
know
they
would
be
useful
to
her
the
things
she
wears
are
touching
they
are
so
well
contrived
and
produce
such
a
decent
effect
with
so
little
lord
walderhurst
inserted
his
monocle
and
gazed
after
the
straight
back
of
the
disappearing
miss
i
think
said
lady
agatha
gently
that
she
is
really
handsome
so
she
is
admitted
walderhurst
quite
a
woman
that
night
lady
agatha
repeated
the
amiability
to
emily
whose
grateful
amazement
really
made
her
blush
lord
walderhurst
knows
sir
bruce
norman
said
agatha
is
it
strange
he
spoke
of
him
to
me
he
says
he
is
clever
you
had
a
nice
talk
this
afternoon
had
you
said
emily
you
both
looked
so
so
as
if
you
were
enjoying
yourselves
when
i
passed
did
he
look
as
if
he
were
enjoying
himself
he
was
very
agreeable
i
did
not
know
he
could
be
so
agreeable
i
have
never
seen
him
look
as
much
pleased
answered
emily
though
he
always
looks
as
if
he
liked
talking
to
you
lady
agatha
that
large
white
gauze
reflectively
is
so
becoming
it
was
very
expensive
sighed
lovely
agatha
and
they
last
such
a
short
time
mamma
said
it
really
seemed
almost
criminal
to
buy
it
how
delightful
it
will
be
remarked
cheering
emily
when
when
you
need
not
think
of
things
like
that
oh
with
another
sigh
this
time
a
catch
of
the
breath
it
would
be
like
heaven
people
do
know
they
think
girls
are
frivolous
when
they
care
and
that
it
is
serious
but
when
one
knows
one
have
things
that
they
are
like
bread
it
is
awful
the
things
you
wear
really
matter
emily
was
bringing
all
her
powers
to
bear
upon
the
subject
and
with
an
anxious
kindness
which
was
quite
angelic
each
dress
makes
you
look
like
another
sort
of
picture
have
you
contemplatively
anything
different
to
wear
and
i
have
two
evening
dresses
i
have
not
worn
here
yet
a
little
hesitatingly
i
well
i
saved
them
one
is
a
very
thin
black
one
with
silver
on
it
it
has
a
trembling
silver
butterfly
for
the
shoulder
and
one
for
the
hair
oh
put
that
on
said
emily
eagerly
when
you
come
down
to
dinner
you
will
look
so
so
new
i
always
think
that
to
see
a
fair
person
suddenly
for
the
first
time
all
in
black
gives
one
a
kind
of
delighted
start
though
start
is
the
word
quite
do
put
it
on
lady
agatha
put
it
on
emily
came
into
her
room
to
help
to
add
the
last
touches
to
her
beauty
before
she
went
down
to
dinner
she
suggested
that
the
fair
hair
should
be
dressed
even
higher
and
more
lightly
than
usual
so
that
the
silver
butterfly
should
poise
the
more
airily
over
the
knot
with
its
quivering
outstretched
wings
she
herself
poised
the
butterfly
high
upon
the
shoulder
oh
it
is
lovely
she
exclaimed
drawing
back
to
gaze
at
the
girl
do
let
me
go
down
a
moment
or
so
before
you
do
so
that
i
can
see
you
come
into
the
room
she
was
sitting
in
a
chair
quite
near
lord
walderhurst
when
her
charge
entered
she
saw
him
really
give
something
quite
like
a
start
when
agatha
appeared
his
monocle
which
had
been
in
his
eye
fell
out
of
it
and
he
picked
it
up
by
its
thin
cord
and
replaced
it
psyche
she
heard
him
say
in
his
odd
voice
which
seemed
merely
to
make
a
statement
without
committing
him
to
an
opinion
psyche
he
did
not
say
it
to
her
or
to
any
one
else
it
was
simply
a
kind
of
exclamation
appreciative
and
perceptive
without
being
enthusiastic
and
it
was
curious
he
talked
to
agatha
nearly
all
the
evening
emily
came
to
lady
agatha
before
she
retired
looking
even
a
little
flushed
what
are
you
going
to
wear
at
the
treat
she
asked
a
white
muslin
with
of
lace
and
the
gauze
and
a
white
parasol
and
shoes
lady
agatha
looked
a
little
nervous
her
pink
fluttered
in
her
cheek
and
night
said
emily
i
have
a
very
pale
blue
wo
you
sit
down
dear
miss
we
must
both
go
to
bed
and
sleep
you
must
not
get
tired
but
she
sat
down
for
a
few
minutes
because
she
saw
the
girl
eyes
asking
her
to
do
it
the
afternoon
post
had
brought
a
more
than
usually
depressing
letter
from
curzon
street
lady
claraway
was
at
her
motherly
wits
ends
and
was
really
quite
touching
in
her
distraction
a
dressmaker
was
entering
a
suit
the
thing
would
get
into
the
papers
of
course
unless
something
happens
something
to
save
us
by
staving
off
things
we
shall
have
to
go
to
castle
clare
at
once
it
will
be
all
over
no
girl
could
be
presented
with
such
a
thing
in
the
air
they
do
like
it
they
of
course
meant
persons
whose
opinions
made
london
law
to
go
to
castle
clare
faltered
agatha
will
be
like
being
sentenced
to
starve
to
death
alix
and
hilda
and
millicent
and
eve
and
i
will
be
starved
quite
slowly
for
the
want
of
the
things
that
make
girls
lives
bearable
when
they
have
been
born
in
a
certain
class
and
even
if
the
most
splendid
thing
happened
in
three
or
four
years
it
would
be
too
late
for
us
four
almost
too
late
for
eve
if
you
are
out
of
london
of
course
you
are
forgotten
people
ca
help
forgetting
why
they
when
there
are
such
crowds
of
new
girls
every
year
emily
was
sweet
she
was
quite
sure
that
they
would
not
be
obliged
to
go
to
castle
clare
without
being
indelicate
she
was
really
able
to
bring
hope
to
the
fore
she
said
a
good
deal
of
the
black
gauze
dress
and
the
lovely
effect
of
the
silver
butterflies
i
suppose
it
was
the
butterflies
which
made
lord
walderhurst
say
psyche
when
he
first
saw
you
she
added
did
he
say
that
and
immediately
lady
agatha
looked
as
if
she
had
not
intended
to
say
the
words
yes
answered
emily
hurrying
on
with
a
casual
air
which
had
a
good
deal
of
tact
in
it
and
black
makes
you
so
wonderfully
fair
and
aërial
you
scarcely
look
quite
real
in
it
you
might
float
away
but
you
must
go
to
sleep
now
lady
agatha
went
with
her
to
the
door
of
the
room
to
bid
her
her
eyes
looked
like
those
of
a
child
who
might
presently
cry
a
little
oh
miss
she
said
in
a
very
young
voice
you
are
so
kind
chapter
four
the
parts
of
the
park
nearest
to
the
house
already
presented
a
busy
aspect
when
miss
passed
through
the
gardens
the
following
morning
tables
were
being
put
up
and
baskets
of
bread
and
cake
and
groceries
were
being
carried
into
the
tent
where
the
tea
was
to
be
prepared
the
workers
looked
interested
and
the
men
touched
their
hats
as
emily
appeared
and
the
women
courtesied
smilingly
they
had
all
discovered
that
she
was
amiable
and
to
be
relied
on
in
her
capacity
of
her
ladyship
representative
she
a
worker
that
miss
one
said
to
the
other
i
never
seen
one
that
was
a
lady
fall
to
as
she
does
ladies
even
when
they
means
well
has
a
way
of
standing
about
and
telling
you
to
do
things
without
seeming
to
know
quite
how
they
ought
to
be
done
she
coming
to
help
with
the
herself
this
morning
and
she
put
up
all
them
packages
of
sweets
yesterday
with
her
own
hands
she
did
up
in
papers
and
tied
with
bits
of
ribbon
because
she
said
she
knowed
children
was
prouder
of
coloured
things
than
plain
they
was
like
that
and
so
they
are
a
bit
of
red
or
blue
goes
a
long
way
with
a
child
emily
cut
and
cake
and
placed
seats
and
arranged
toys
on
tables
all
the
morning
the
day
was
hot
though
beautiful
and
she
was
so
busy
that
she
had
scarcely
time
for
her
breakfast
the
household
party
was
in
the
gayest
spirits
lady
maria
was
in
her
most
amusing
mood
she
had
planned
a
drive
to
some
interesting
ruins
for
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
and
a
for
the
evening
her
favourite
neighbours
had
just
returned
to
their
five
miles
away
and
they
were
coming
to
the
dinner
to
her
great
satisfaction
most
of
her
neighbours
bored
her
and
she
took
them
in
doses
at
her
dinners
as
she
would
have
taken
medicine
but
the
lockyers
were
young
and
and
clever
and
she
was
always
glad
when
they
came
to
loche
during
her
stay
at
mallowe
there
is
not
a
frump
or
a
bore
among
them
she
said
in
the
country
people
are
usually
frumps
when
they
are
not
bores
and
bores
when
they
are
not
frumps
and
i
am
in
danger
of
becoming
both
myself
six
weeks
of
unalloyed
composed
of
certain
people
i
know
would
make
me
begin
to
wear
moreen
petticoats
and
talk
about
the
deplorable
condition
of
london
society
she
led
all
her
flock
out
on
to
the
lawn
under
the
after
breakfast
let
us
go
and
encourage
industry
she
said
we
will
watch
emily
working
she
is
an
example
curiously
enough
this
was
miss
cora
brooke
day
she
found
herself
actually
walking
across
the
lawn
with
lord
walderhurst
by
her
side
she
did
not
know
how
it
happened
but
it
seemed
to
occur
accidentally
we
never
talk
to
each
other
he
said
well
answered
cora
we
have
talked
to
other
people
a
great
deal
at
least
i
have
yes
you
have
talked
a
good
deal
said
the
marquis
does
that
mean
i
have
talked
too
much
he
surveyed
her
prettiness
through
his
glass
perhaps
the
holiday
stir
in
the
air
gave
him
a
festive
moment
it
means
that
you
have
talked
enough
to
me
you
have
devoted
yourself
too
much
to
the
laying
low
of
young
heriot
she
laughed
a
trifle
saucily
you
are
a
very
independent
young
lady
remarked
walderhurst
with
a
lighter
manner
than
usual
you
ought
to
say
something
deprecatory
or
a
little
coy
perhaps
i
sha
said
cora
composedly
sha
or
wo
he
inquired
they
are
both
bad
words
for
little
girls
or
young
ladies
to
use
to
their
elders
both
said
miss
cora
brooke
with
a
slightly
pleased
flush
let
us
go
over
to
the
tents
and
see
what
poor
emily
is
doing
poor
emily
said
the
marquis
they
went
but
they
did
not
stay
long
the
treat
was
taking
form
emily
was
hot
and
deeply
engaged
people
were
coming
to
her
for
orders
she
had
a
thousand
things
to
do
and
to
superintend
the
doing
of
the
prizes
for
the
races
and
the
presents
for
the
children
must
be
arranged
in
order
things
for
boys
and
things
for
girls
presents
for
little
children
and
presents
for
big
ones
nobody
must
be
missed
and
no
one
must
be
given
the
wrong
thing
it
would
be
dreadful
you
know
emily
said
to
the
two
when
they
came
into
her
tent
and
began
to
ask
questions
if
a
big
boy
should
get
a
small
wooden
horse
or
a
little
baby
should
be
given
a
cricket
bat
and
ball
then
it
would
be
so
disappointing
if
a
tiny
girl
got
a
and
a
big
one
got
a
doll
one
has
to
get
things
in
order
they
look
forward
to
this
so
and
it
to
a
child
to
be
disappointed
is
it
walderhurst
gazed
uninspiringly
who
did
this
for
lady
maria
when
you
were
not
here
he
inquired
oh
other
people
but
she
says
it
was
tiresome
then
with
an
illumined
smile
she
has
asked
me
to
mallowe
for
the
next
twenty
years
for
the
treats
she
is
so
kind
maria
is
a
kind
woman
with
what
seemed
to
emily
delightful
amiability
she
is
kind
to
her
treats
and
she
is
kind
to
maria
bayne
she
is
kind
to
said
emily
you
do
know
how
i
am
enjoying
this
that
woman
enjoys
everything
lord
walderhurst
said
when
he
walked
away
with
cora
what
a
temperament
to
have
i
would
give
ten
thousand
a
year
for
it
she
has
so
little
said
cora
that
everything
seems
beautiful
to
her
one
does
wonder
either
she
very
nice
mother
and
i
quite
admire
her
we
are
thinking
of
inviting
her
to
new
york
and
giving
her
a
real
good
time
she
would
enjoy
new
york
have
you
ever
been
there
lord
walderhurst
no
you
ought
to
come
really
so
many
englishmen
come
now
and
they
all
seem
to
like
it
perhaps
i
will
come
said
walderhurst
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
one
is
tired
of
the
continent
and
one
knows
india
one
does
know
fifth
avenue
and
central
park
and
the
rocky
mountains
one
might
try
them
suggested
pretty
miss
cora
this
certainly
was
her
day
lord
walderhurst
took
her
and
her
mother
out
in
his
own
particular
high
phaeton
before
lunch
he
was
fond
of
driving
and
his
own
phaeton
and
horses
had
come
to
mallowe
with
him
he
took
only
his
favourites
out
and
though
he
bore
himself
on
this
occasion
with
a
calm
air
the
event
caused
a
little
smiling
flurry
on
the
lawn
at
least
when
the
phaeton
spun
down
the
avenue
with
miss
brooke
and
her
mother
looking
slightly
flushed
and
thrilled
in
their
high
seats
of
honour
several
people
exchanged
glances
and
raised
lady
agatha
went
to
her
room
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
curzon
street
ralph
talked
about
the

young
heriot
and
a
group
of
others
the
afternoon
brilliant
and
blazing

new
visitors
to
assist
by
their
presence
at
the
treat
lady
maria
always
had
a
large
and
added
guests
from
the
neighbourhood
to
make
for
gaiety
at
two
a
procession
of
village
children
and
their
friends
and
parents
headed
by
the
village
band
marched
up
the
avenue
and
passed
before
the
house
on
their
way
to
their
special
part
of
the
park
lady
maria
and
her
guests
stood
upon
the
broad
steps
and
welcomed
the
jocund
crowd
as
it
moved
by
with
hospitable
bows
and
nods
and
becks
and
wreathed
smiles
everybody
was
in
a
delighted
as
the
villagers
gathered
in
the
park
the
joined
them
by
way
of
the
gardens
a
conjurer
from
london
gave
an
entertainment
under
a
huge
tree
and
children
found
white
rabbits
taken
from
their
pockets
and
oranges
from
their
caps
with
squeals
of
joy
and
shouts
of
laughter
lady
maria
guests
walked
about
and
looked
on
laughing
with
the
children
the
great
affair
of
tea
followed
the
performance
no
treat
is
fairly
under
way
until
the
children
are
filled
to
the
brim
with
tea
and
buns
and
cake
principally
cake
in
plummy
wedges
lady
agatha
and
ralph
handed
cake
along
rows
of
children
seated
on
the
grass
miss
brooke
was
talking
to
lord
walderhurst
when
the
work
began
she
had
poppies
in
her
hat
and
carried
a
parasol
and
sat
under
a
tree
looking
very
alluring
i
ought
to
go
and
help
to
hand
cake
she
said
my
cousin
maria
ought
to
do
it
remarked
lord
walderhurst
but
she
will
not
neither
shall
i
tell
me
something
about
the
elevated
railroad
and
street
he
had
a
slightly
rude
gracefully
languid
air
which
cora
brooke
found
somewhat
impressive
after
all
emily
handed
cake
and
regulated
supplies
with
cheerful
tact
and
good
spirits
when
the
older
people
were
given
their
tea
she
moved
about
their
tables
attending
to
every
one
she
was
too
in
her
interest
in
her
hospitalities
to
find
time
to
join
lady
maria
and
her
party
at
the
table
under
the
she
ate
some
and
drank
a
cup
of
tea
while
she
talked
to
some
old
women
she
had
made
friends
with
she
was
really
enjoying
herself
immensely
though
occasionally
she
was
obliged
to
sit
down
for
a
few
moments
just
to
rest
her
tired
feet
the
children
came
to
her
as
to
an
omnipotent
and
benign
being
she
knew
where
the
toys
were
kept
and
what
prizes
were
to
be
given
for
the
races
she
represented
law
and
order
and
bestowal
the
other
ladies
walked
about
in
wonderful
dresses
smiling
and
exalted
the
gentlemen
aided
the
sports
in
an
amateurish
way
and
made
patrician
jokes
among
themselves
but
this
one
lady
seemed
to
be
part
of
the
treat
itself
she
was
not
so
grandly
dressed
as
the
others
her
dress
was
only
blue
linen
with
white
bands
on
it
and
she
had
only
a
sailor
hat
with
a
buckle
and
bow
but
she
was
of
her
ladyship
world
of
london
people
nevertheless
and
they
liked
her
more
than
they
had
ever
liked
a
lady
before
it
was
a
fine
treat
and
she
seemed
to
have
made
it
so
there
had
never
been
quite
such
a
varied
and
jovial
treat
at
mallowe
before
the
afternoon
waxed
and
waned
the
children
played
games
and
raced
and
rejoiced
until
their
young
limbs
began
to
fail
them
the
older
people
sauntered
about
or
sat
in
groups
to
talk
and
listen
to
the
village
band
lady
maria
visitors
having
had
enough
of
rural
festivities
went
back
to
the
gardens
in
excellent
spirits
to
talk
and
to
watch
a
game
of
tennis
which
had
taken
form
on
the
court
emily
pleasure
had
not
abated
but
her
colour
had
done
so
her
limbs
ached
and
her
face
was
pale
as
she
stood
under
the
regarding
the
final
ceremonies
of
the
festal
day
to
preside
over
which
lady
maria
and
her
party
returned
from
their
seats
under
the
the
national
anthem
was
sung
loudly
and
there
were
three
tremendous
cheers
given
for
her
ladyship
they
were
such
joyous
and
hearty
cheers
that
emily
was
stirred
almost
to
emotional
tears
at
all
events
her
hazel
eyes
looked
nice
and
moistly
bright
she
was
an
easily
moved
creature
lord
walderhurst
stood
near
lady
maria
and
looked
pleased
also
emily
saw
him
speak
to
her
ladyship
and
saw
lady
maria
smile
then
he
stepped
forward
with
his
air
and
his
monocle
glaring
calmly
in
his
eye
boys
and
girls
he
said
in
a
clear
voice
i
want
you
to
give
three
of
the
biggest
cheers
you
are
capable
of
for
the
lady
who
has
worked
to
make
your
treat
the
success
it
has
been
her
ladyship
tells
me
she
has
never
had
such
a
treat
before
three
cheers
for
miss
emily
gave
a
gasp
and
felt
a
lump
rise
in
her
throat
she
felt
as
if
she
had
been
without
warning
suddenly
changed
into
a
royal
personage
and
she
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
the
whole
treat
juvenile
and
adult
male
and
female
burst
into
three
cheers
which
were
roars
and
bellows
hats
and
caps
were
waved
and
tossed
into
the
air
and
every
creature
turned
toward
her
as
she
blushed
and
bowed
in
tremulous
gratitude
and
delight
oh
lady
maria
oh
lord
walderhurst
she
said
when
she
managed
to
get
to
them
how
you
are
to
me
chapter
five
after
she
had
taken
her
early
tea
in
the
morning
emily
lay
upon
her
pillows
and
gazed
out
upon
the
near
her
window
in
a
state
of
bliss
she
was
tired
but
happy
how
well
everything
had
gone
off
how
pleased
lady
maria
had
been
and
how
kind
of
lord
walderhurst
to
ask
the
villagers
to
give
three
cheers
for
herself
she
had
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
it
was
the
kind
of
attention
not
usually
offered
to
her
she
smiled
her
childlike
smile
and
blushed
at
the
memory
of
it
her
impression
of
the
world
was
that
people
were
really
very
amiable
as
a
rule
they
were
always
good
to
her
at
least
she
thought
and
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
if
she
had
not
paid
her
way
so
remarkably
well
by
being
useful
they
might
have
been
less
agreeable
never
once
had
she
doubted
that
lady
maria
was
the
most
admirable
and
generous
of
human
beings
she
was
not
aware
in
the
least
that
her
ladyship
got
a
good
deal
out
of
her
in
justice
to
her
ladyship
it
may
be
said
that
she
was
not
wholly
aware
of
it
herself
and
that
emily
absolutely
enjoyed
being
made
use
of
this
morning
however
when
she
got
up
she
found
herself
more
tired
than
she
ever
remembered
being
before
and
it
may
be
easily
argued
that
a
woman
who
runs
about
london
on
other
people
errands
often
knows
what
it
is
to
be
aware
of
aching
limbs
she
laughed
a
little
when
she
discovered
that
her
feet
were
actually
rather
swollen
and
that
she
must
wear
a
pair
of
her
easiest
slippers
i
must
sit
down
as
much
as
i
can
she
thought
and
yet
with
the
and
the
excursion
this
morning
there
may
be
a
number
of
little
things
lady
maria
would
like
me
to
do
there
were
indeed
numbers
of
things
lady
maria
was
extremely
glad
to
ask
her
to
do
the
drive
to
the
ruins
was
to
be
made
before
lunch
because
some
of
the
guests
felt
that
an
afternoon
jaunt
would
leave
them
rather
fagged
for
the
in
the
evening
lady
maria
was
not
going
and
as
presently
became
apparent
the
carriages
would
be
rather
crowded
if
miss
joined
the
party
on
the
whole
emily
was
not
sorry
to
have
an
excuse
for
remaining
at
home
and
so
the
carriages
drove
away
comfortably
filled
and
lady
maria
and
miss
watched
their
departure
i
have
no
intention
of
having
my
venerable
bones
rattled
over
hill
and
dale
the
day
i
give
a
said
her
ladyship
please
ring
the
bell
emily
i
want
to
make
sure
of
the
fish
fish
is
one
of
the
problems
of
country
life
fishmongers
are
demons
and
when
they
live
five
miles
from
one
they
can
arouse
the
most
powerful
human
emotions
mallowe
court
was
at
a
distance
from
the
country
town
delightful
in
its
effects
upon
the
rusticity
of
the
neighbourhood
but
appalling
when
considered
in
connection
with
fish
one
could
not
dine
without
fish
the
town
was
small
and
barren
of
resources
and
the
one
fishmonger
of
weak
mind
and
unreliable
nature
the
footman
who
obeyed
the
summons
of
the
bell
informed
her
ladyship
that
the
cook
was
rather
anxious
about
the
fish
as
usual
the
fishmonger
had
been
a
little
doubtful
as
to
whether
he
could
supply
her
needs
and
his
cart
never
arrived
until
twelve
great
goodness
exclaimed
her
ladyship
when
the
man
retired
what
a
situation
if
we
found
ourselves
without
fish
old
general
barnes
is
the
most
ferocious
old
gourmand
in
england
and
he
loathes
people
who
give
him
bad
dinners
we
are
all
rather
afraid
of
him
the
fact
is
and
i
will
own
that
i
am
vain
about
my
dinners
that
is
the
last
charm
nature
leaves
a
woman
the
power
to
give
decent
dinners
i
shall
be
fearfully
annoyed
if
any
ridiculous
thing
happens
they
sat
in
the
together
writing
notes
and
talking
and
as
twelve
drew
near
watching
for
the
fishmonger
cart
once
or
twice
lady
maria
spoke
of
lord
walderhurst
he
is
an
interesting
creature
to
my
mind
she
said
i
have
always
rather
liked
him
he
has
original
ideas
though
he
is
not
in
the
least
brilliant
i
believe
he
talks
more
freely
to
me
on
the
whole
than
to
most
people
though
i
ca
say
he
has
a
particularly
good
opinion
of
me
he
stuck
his
glass
in
his
eye
and
stared
at
me
last
night
in
that
weird
way
of
his
and
said
to
me
in
an
ingenuous
fashion
of
your
own
you
are
the
most
abominably
selfish
woman
i
ever
beheld
still
i
know
he
rather
likes
me
i
said
to
him
is
quite
true
james
i
am
selfish
but
i
not
selfish
abominably
selfish
people
always
have
nasty
tempers
and
no
one
can
accuse
me
of
having
a
nasty
temper
i
have
the
disposition
of
a
bowl
of
bread
and
milk
emily
as
wheels
rattled
up
the
avenue
that
the
cart
no
answered
emily
at
the
window
it
is
the
butcher
his
attitude
toward
the
women
here
has
made
my
joy
lady
maria
proceeded
smiling
over
the
fishermen
knitted
helmet
she
had
taken
up
he
behaves
beautifully
to
them
all
but
not
one
of
them
has
really
a
leg
to
stand
on
as
far
as
he
is
responsible
for
it
but
i
will
tell
you
something
emily
she
paused
miss
waited
with
interested
eyes
he
is
thinking
of
bringing
the
thing
to
an
end
and
marrying
woman
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
do
you
think
so
exclaimed
emily
oh
i
ca
help
hoping
but
she
paused
also
you
hope
it
will
be
agatha
slade
lady
maria
ended
for
her
well
perhaps
it
will
be
i
sometimes
think
it
is
agatha
if
it
any
one
and
yet
i
not
sure
one
never
could
be
sure
with
walderhurst
he
has
always
had
a
trick
of
keeping
more
than
his
mouth
shut
i
wonder
if
he
could
have
any
other
woman
up
his
sleeve
why
do
you
think
began
emily
lady
maria
laughed
for
an
odd
reason
the
walderhursts
have
a
ridiculously
splendid
ring
in
the
family
which
they
have
a
way
of
giving
to
the
women
they
become
engaged
to
it
ridiculous
because
well
because
a
ruby
as
big
as
a
trouser
button
ridiculous
you
ca
get
over
that
there
is
a
story
connected
with
this
one
centuries
and
things
and
something
about
the
woman
the
first
walderhurst
had
it
made
for
she
was
a
dame
something
or
other
who
had
snubbed
the
king
for
being
forward
and
the
snubbing
was
so
good
for
him
that
he
thought
she
was
a
saint
and
gave
the
ruby
for
her
betrothal
well
by
the
merest
accident
i
found
walderhurst
had
sent
his
man
to
town
for
it
it
came
two
days
ago
oh
how
interesting
said
emily
thrilled
it
mean
something
it
is
rather
a
joke
wheels
again
emily
is
the
fishmonger
emily
went
to
the
window
once
more
yes
she
answered
if
his
name
is
buggle
his
name
buggle
said
lady
maria
and
we
are
saved
but
five
minutes
later
the
cook
herself
appeared
at
the
door
she
was
a
stout
person
who
panted
and
respectfully
removed
beads
of
perspiration
from
her
brow
with
a
clean
handkerchief
she
was
as
nearly
pale
as
a
heated
person
of
her
weight
may
be
and
what
has
happened
now
cook
asked
lady
maria
that
buggle
your
ladyship
said
cook
says
your
ladyship
ca
be
no
sorrier
than
he
is
but
when
fish
goes
bad
in
a
night
it
ca
be
made
fresh
in
the
morning
he
brought
it
that
i
might
see
it
for
myself
and
it
is
in
a
state
as
could
not
be
used
by
any
one
i
was
that
upset
your
ladyship
that
i
felt
like
i
must
come
and
explain
myself
what
be
done
exclaimed
lady
maria
emily
suggest
something
we
ca
even
be
sure
said
the
cook
that
batch
has
what
would
suit
us
batch
sometimes
has
it
but
he
is
the
fishmonger
at
maundell
and
that
is
four
miles
away
and
we
are
your
ladyship
now
the
is
so
full
and
not
a
servant
that
could
be
spared
dear
me
said
lady
maria
emily
this
is
really
enough
to
drive
one
quite
mad
if
everything
was
not
out
of
the
stables
i
know
you
would
drive
over
to
maundell
you
are
such
a
good
walker
catching
a
gleam
of
hope
do
you
think
you
could
walk
emily
tried
to
look
cheerful
lady
maria
situation
was
really
an
awful
one
for
a
hostess
it
would
not
have
mattered
in
the
least
if
her
strong
healthy
body
had
not
been
so
tired
she
was
an
excellent
walker
and
ordinarily
eight
miles
would
have
meant
nothing
in
the
way
of
fatigue
she
was
kept
in
good
training
by
her
walking
in
town
springy
moorland
swept
by
fresh
breezes
was
not
like
london
streets
i
think
i
can
manage
it
she
said
if
i
had
not
run
about
so
much
yesterday
it
would
be
a
mere
nothing
you
must
have
the
fish
of
course
i
will
walk
over
the
moor
to
maundell
and
tell
batch
it
must
be
sent
at
once
then
i
will
come
back
slowly
i
can
rest
on
the
heather
by
the
way
the
moor
is
lovely
in
the
afternoon
you
dear
soul
lady
maria
broke
forth
what
a
boon
you
are
to
a
woman
she
felt
quite
grateful
there
arose
in
her
mind
an
impulse
to
invite
emily
to
remain
the
rest
of
her
life
with
her
but
she
was
too
experienced
an
elderly
lady
to
give
way
to
impulses
she
privately
resolved
however
that
she
would
have
her
a
good
deal
in
south
audley
street
and
would
make
her
some
decent
presents
when
emily
attired
for
her
walk
in
her
shortest
brown
linen
frock
and
shadiest
hat
passed
through
the
hall
the
was
just
delivering
the
midday
letters
to
a
footman
the
servant
presented
his
salver
to
her
with
a
letter
for
herself
lying
upon
the
top
of
one
addressed
in
lady
claraway
handwriting
to
the
lady
agatha
slade
emily
recognised
it
as
one
of
the
epistles
of
many
sheets
which
so
often
made
poor
agatha
shed
slow
and
depressed
tears
her
own
letter
was
directed
in
the
hand
of
cupp
and
she
wondered
what
it
could
contain
i
hope
the
poor
things
are
not
in
any
trouble
she
thought
they
were
afraid
the
young
man
in
the
was
engaged
if
he
got
married
and
left
them
i
do
know
what
they
would
do
he
has
been
so
regular
though
the
day
was
hot
the
weather
was
perfect
and
emily
having
exchanged
her
easy
slippers
for
an
almost
equally
easy
pair
of
tan
shoes
found
her
tired
feet
might
still
be
used
her
disposition
to
make
the
very
best
of
things
inspired
her
to
regard
even
an
walk
with
courage
the
moorland
air
was
so
sweet
the
sound
of
the
bees
droning
as
they
stumbled
about
in
the
heather
was
such
a
comfortable
peaceful
thing
that
she
convinced
herself
that
she
should
find
the
four
miles
to
maundell
quite
agreeable
she
had
so
many
nice
things
to
think
of
that
she
temporarily
forgot
that
she
had
put
cupp
letter
in
her
pocket
and
was
across
the
moor
before
she
remembered
it
dear
me
she
exclaimed
when
she
recalled
it
i
must
see
what
has
happened
she
opened
the
envelope
and
began
to
read
as
she
walked
but
she
had
not
taken
many
steps
before
she
uttered
an
exclamation
and
stopped
how
very
nice
for
them
she
said
but
she
turned
rather
pale
from
a
worldly
point
of
view
the
news
the
letter
contained
was
indeed
very
nice
for
the
cupps
but
it
put
a
painful
aspect
upon
the
simple
affairs
of
poor
miss
it
is
a
great
piece
of
news
in
one
way
wrote
cupp
and
yet
me
and
jane
ca
help
feeling
a
bit
low
at
the
thought
of
the
changes
it
will
make
and
us
living
where
you
wo
be
with
us
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
miss
my
brother
william
made
a
good
bit
of
money
in
australia
but
he
has
always
been
homesick
for
the
old
country
as
he
always
calls
england
his
wife
was
a
colonial
and
when
she
died
a
year
ago
he
made
up
his
mind
to
come
home
to
settle
in
chichester
where
he
was
born
he
says
there
nothing
like
the
feeling
of
a
cathedral
town
he
bought
such
a
nice
house
a
bit
out
with
a
big
garden
and
he
wants
me
and
jane
to
come
and
make
a
home
with
him
he
says
he
has
worked
hard
all
his
life
and
now
he
means
to
be
comfortable
and
he
ca
be
bothered
with
housekeeping
he
promises
to
provide
well
for
us
both
and
he
wants
us
to
sell
up
mortimer
street
and
come
as
quick
as
possible
but
we
miss
you
miss
and
though
her
uncle
william
keeps
a
trap
and
everything
according
and
jane
is
grateful
for
his
kindness
she
broke
down
and
cried
hard
last
night
and
says
to
me
mother
if
miss
could
just
manage
to
take
me
as
a
maid
i
would
rather
be
it
than
anything
traps
do
feed
the
heart
mother
and
i
a
feeling
for
miss
as
is
perhaps
unbecoming
to
my
station
but
got
the
men
in
the
house
ticketing
things
miss
and
we
want
to
know
what
we
shall
do
with
the
articles
in
your
the
friendliness
of
the
two
faithful
cupps
and
the
humble
comforts
of
the
had
meant
home
to
emily
when
she
had
turned
her
face
and
her
tired
feet
away
from
discouraging
errands
and
small
humiliations
and
discomforts
she
had
turned
them
toward
the
the
hot
little
fire
the
small
fat
black
kettle
singing
on
the
hob
and
the
not
being
given
to
crossing
bridges
before
she
reached
them
she
had
never
contemplated
the
dreary
possibility
that
her
refuge
might
be
taken
away
from
her
she
had
not
dwelt
upon
the
fact
that
she
had
no
other
real
refuge
on
earth
as
she
walked
among
the
heather
and
the
luxuriously
droning
bees
she
dwelt
upon
it
now
with
a
suddenly
realising
sense
as
it
came
home
to
her
soul
her
eyes
filled
with
big
tears
which
brimmed
over
and
rolled
down
her
cheeks
they
dropped
upon
the
breast
of
her
linen
blouse
and
left
marks
i
shall
have
to
find
a
new
somewhere
she
said
the
breast
of
the
linen
blouse
lifting
itself
sharply
it
will
be
so
different
to
be
in
a
house
with
strangers
cupp
and
jane
she
was
obliged
to
take
out
her
handkerchief
at
that
moment
i
am
afraid
i
ca
get
anything
respectable
for
ten
shillings
a
week
it
was
very
cheap
and
they
were
so
nice
all
her
fatigue
of
the
early
morning
had
returned
her
feet
began
to
burn
and
ache
and
the
sun
felt
almost
unbearably
hot
the
mist
in
her
eyes
prevented
her
seeing
the
path
before
her
once
or
twice
she
stumbled
over
something
it
seems
as
if
it
must
be
farther
than
four
miles
she
said
and
then
there
is
the
walk
back
i
tired
but
i
must
get
on
really
chapter
six
the
drive
to
the
ruins
had
been
a
great
success
it
was
a
drive
of
just
sufficient
length
to
put
people
in
spirits
without
fatiguing
them
the
party
came
back
to
lunch
with
delightful
appetities
lady
agatha
and
miss
cora
brooke
had
pink
cheeks
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
had
behaved
charmingly
to
both
of
them
he
had
helped
each
of
them
to
climb
about
among
the
ruins
and
had
taken
them
both
up
the
steep
dark
stairway
of
one
of
the
towers
and
stood
with
them
looking
over
the
turrets
into
the
courtyard
and
the
moat
he
knew
the
history
of
the
castle
and
could
point
out
the
and
the
chapel
and
the
and
knew
legends
about
the
dungeons
he
gives
us
all
a
turn
mother
said
miss
cora
brooke
he
even
gave
a
turn
yesterday
to
poor
emily
he
rather
nice
there
was
a
great
deal
of
laughter
at
lunch
after
their
return
miss
cora
brooke
was
quite
brilliant
in
her
gay
little
sallies
but
though
she
was
more
talkative
than
lady
agatha
she
did
not
look
more
brilliant
the
letter
from
curzon
street
had
not
made
the
beauty
shed
tears
her
face
had
fallen
when
it
had
been
handed
to
her
on
her
return
and
she
had
taken
it
upstairs
to
her
room
with
rather
a
flagging
step
but
when
she
came
down
to
lunch
she
walked
with
the
movement
of
a
nymph
her
lovely
little
face
wore
a
sort
of
tremulous
radiance
she
laughed
like
a
child
at
every
amusing
thing
that
was
said
she
might
have
been
ten
years
old
instead
of
her
colour
her
eyes
her
spirits
seemed
of
a
freshness
so
infantine
she
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
laughing
enchantingly
at
one
of
miss
brooke
sparkling
remarks
when
lord
walderhurst
who
sat
next
to
her
said
suddenly
glancing
round
the
table
but
where
is
miss
it
was
perhaps
a
significant
fact
that
up
to
this
moment
nobody
had
observed
her
absence
it
was
lady
maria
who
replied
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
answer
she
said
as
i
have
said
before
emily
has
become
the
lodestar
of
my
existence
i
can
not
live
without
her
she
has
walked
over
to
maundell
to
make
sure
that
we
do
not
have
a
without
fish
she
has
over
to
maundell
said
lord
walderhurst
after
yesterday
there
was
not
a
pair
of
wheels
left
in
the
stable
answered
lady
maria
it
is
disgraceful
of
course
but
she
is
a
splendid
walker
and
she
said
she
was
not
too
tired
to
do
it
it
is
the
kind
of
thing
she
ought
to
be
given
the
victoria
cross
for
saving
one
from
a
without
fish
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
took
up
the
cord
of
his
monocle
and
fixed
the
glass
rigidly
in
his
eye
it
is
not
only
four
miles
to
maundell
he
remarked
staring
at
the
not
at
lady
maria
but
it
is
four
miles
back
by
a
singular
coincidence
said
lady
maria
the
talk
and
laughter
went
on
and
the
lunch
also
but
lord
walderhurst
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
did
not
finish
his
for
a
few
seconds
he
stared
at
the
then
he
pushed
aside
his
nearly
cutlet
then
he
got
up
from
his
chair
quietly
excuse
me
maria
he
said
and
without
further
ado
went
out
of
the
room
and
walked
toward
the
stables
there
was
excellent
fish
at
maundell
batch
produced
it
at
once
fresh
sound
and
desirable
had
she
been
in
her
normal
spirits
emily
would
have
rejoiced
at
the
sight
of
it
and
have
retraced
her
four
miles
to
mallowe
in
absolute
jubilation
she
would
have
shortened
and
beguiled
her
return
journey
by
depicting
to
herself
lady
maria
pleasure
and
relief
but
the
letter
from
cupp
lay
like
a
weight
of
lead
in
her
pocket
it
had
given
her
such
things
to
think
of
as
she
walked
that
she
had
been
oblivious
to
heather
and
bees
and
sky
and
had
felt
more
tired
than
in
any
tramp
through
london
streets
that
she
could
call
to
mind
each
step
she
took
seemed
to
be
carrying
her
farther
away
from
the
few
square
yards
of
home
the
had
represented
under
the
dominion
of
the
cupps
every
moment
she
recalled
more
strongly
that
it
had
been
home
home
of
course
it
had
not
been
the
back
room
so
much
as
it
had
been
the
cupps
who
made
it
so
who
had
regarded
her
as
a
sort
of
possession
who
had
liked
to
serve
her
and
had
done
it
with
actual
affection
i
shall
have
to
find
a
new
place
she
kept
saying
i
shall
have
to
go
among
quite
strange
people
she
had
suddenly
a
new
sense
of
being
without
resource
that
was
one
of
the
proofs
of
the
curious
heaviness
of
the
blow
the
simple
occurrence
was
to
her
she
felt
temporarily
almost
as
if
there
were
no
other
in
london
though
she
knew
that
really
there
were
tens
of
thousands
the
fact
was
that
though
there
might
be
other
cupps
or
their
counterparts
she
could
not
make
herself
believe
such
a
good
thing
possible
she
had
been
physically
worn
out
before
she
had
read
the
letter
and
its
effect
had
been
proportionate
to
her
fatigue
and
lack
of
power
to
rebound
she
was
vaguely
surprised
to
feel
that
the
tears
kept
filling
her
eyes
and
falling
on
her
cheeks
in
big
heavy
drops
she
was
obliged
to
use
her
handkerchief
frequently
as
if
she
was
suddenly
developing
a
cold
in
her
head
i
must
take
care
she
said
once
quite
prosaically
but
with
more
pathos
in
her
voice
than
she
was
aware
of
or
i
shall
make
my
nose
quite
red
illustration
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
though
batch
was
able
to
supply
fish
he
was
unfortunately
not
able
to
send
it
to
mallowe
his
cart
had
gone
out
on
a
round
just
before
miss
arrival
and
there
was
no
knowing
when
it
would
return
then
i
must
carry
the
fish
myself
said
emily
you
can
put
it
in
a
neat
basket
i
very
sorry
miss
i
am
indeed
miss
said
batch
looking
hot
and
pained
it
will
not
be
heavy
returned
emily
and
her
ladyship
must
be
sure
of
it
for
the
so
she
turned
back
to
recross
the
moor
with
a
basket
of
fish
on
her
arm
and
she
was
so
pathetically
unhappy
that
she
felt
that
so
long
as
she
lived
the
odour
of
fresh
fish
would
make
her
feel
sorrowful
she
had
heard
of
people
who
were
made
sorrowful
by
the
odour
of
a
flower
or
the
sound
of
a
melody
but
in
her
case
it
would
be
the
smell
of
fresh
fish
that
would
make
her
sad
if
she
had
been
a
person
with
a
sense
of
humour
she
might
have
seen
that
this
was
a
thing
to
laugh
at
a
little
but
she
was
not
a
humorous
woman
and
just
now
oh
i
shall
have
to
find
a
new
place
she
was
thinking
and
i
have
lived
in
that
little
room
for
years
the
sun
got
hotter
and
hotter
and
her
feet
became
so
tired
that
she
could
scarcely
drag
one
of
them
after
another
she
had
forgotten
that
she
had
left
mallowe
before
lunch
and
that
she
ought
to
have
got
a
cup
of
tea
at
least
at
maundell
before
she
had
walked
a
mile
on
her
way
back
she
realised
that
she
was
frightfully
hungry
and
rather
faint
there
is
not
even
a
cottage
where
i
could
get
a
glass
of
water
she
thought
the
basket
which
was
really
comparatively
light
began
to
feel
heavy
on
her
arm
and
at
length
she
felt
sure
that
a
certain
burning
spot
on
her
left
heel
must
be
a
blister
which
was
being
rubbed
by
her
shoe
how
it
hurt
her
and
how
tired
she
was
how
tired
and
when
she
left
mallowe
lovely
luxurious
mallowe
she
would
not
go
back
to
her
little
room
all
fresh
from
the
cupps
autumn
which
included
the
washing
and
ironing
of
her
hangings
and
she
would
be
obliged
to
huddle
into
any
poor
place
she
could
find
and
cupp
and
jane
would
be
in
chichester
but
what
good
fortune
it
is
for
them
she
murmured
they
need
never
be
anxious
about
the
future
again
how
how
wonderful
it
must
be
to
know
that
one
need
not
be
afraid
of
the
future
i
indeed
i
think
i
really
must
sit
down
she
sat
down
upon
the
heather
and
actually
let
her
face
drop
upon
her
hands
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
said
helplessly
i
must
not
let
myself
do
this
i
must
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
was
so
overpowered
by
her
sense
of
her
own
weakness
that
she
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
fact
that
she
must
control
it
upon
the
elastic
moorland
road
wheels
stole
upon
one
without
sound
so
the
wheels
of
a
rapidly
driven
high
cart
approached
her
and
were
almost
at
her
side
before
she
lifted
her
head
startled
by
a
sudden
consciousness
that
a
vehicle
was
near
her
it
was
lord
walderhurst
cart
and
even
as
she
gazed
at
him
with
alarmed
wet
eyes
his
lordship
descended
from
it
and
made
a
sign
to
his
groom
who
at
once
impassively
drove
on
emily
lips
tried
to
tremble
into
a
smile
she
put
out
her
hand
fumblingly
toward
the
and
having
secured
it
began
to
rise
i
sat
down
to
rest
she
faltered
even
apologetically
i
walked
to
maundell
and
it
was
so
hot
just
at
that
moment
a
little
breeze
sprang
up
and
swept
across
her
cheek
she
was
so
grateful
that
her
smile
became
less
difficult
i
got
what
lady
maria
wanted
she
added
and
the
childlike
dimple
in
her
cheek
endeavoured
to
defy
her
eyes
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
looked
rather
odd
emily
had
never
seen
him
look
like
this
before
he
took
a
silver
flask
out
of
his
pocket
in
a
way
and
filled
its
cup
with
something
that
is
sherry
he
said
please
drink
it
you
are
absolutely
faint
she
held
out
her
hand
eagerly
she
could
not
help
it
oh
thank
you
thank
you
she
said
i
am
thirsty
and
she
drank
it
as
if
it
were
the
nectar
of
the
gods
now
miss
he
said
please
sit
down
again
i
came
here
to
drive
you
back
to
mallowe
and
the
cart
will
not
come
back
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
you
came
on
purpose
she
exclaimed
feeling
in
truth
somewhat
but
how
kind
of
you
lord
walderhurst
how
good
it
was
the
most
unforeseen
and
amazing
experience
of
her
life
and
at
once
she
sought
for
some
reason
which
could
connect
with
his
coming
some
more
interesting
person
than
mere
emily
oh
the
thought
flashed
upon
her
he
had
come
for
some
reason
connected
with
lady
agatha
he
made
her
sit
down
on
the
heather
again
and
he
took
a
seat
beside
her
he
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
you
have
been
crying
he
remarked
there
was
no
use
denying
it
and
what
was
there
in
the
good
eye
gazing
through
the
monocle
which
so
moved
her
by
its
suggestion
of
kindness
and
and
some
new
feeling
yes
i
have
she
admitted
i
do
often
but
well
yes
i
have
what
was
it
it
was
the
most
extraordinary
thump
her
heart
gave
at
this
moment
she
had
never
felt
such
an
absolute
thump
it
was
perhaps
because
she
was
tired
his
voice
had
lowered
itself
no
man
had
ever
spoken
to
her
before
like
that
it
made
one
feel
as
if
he
was
not
an
exalted
person
at
all
only
a
kind
kind
one
she
must
not
presume
upon
his
kindness
and
make
much
of
her
prosaic
troubles
she
tried
to
smile
in
a
proper
casual
way
oh
it
was
a
small
thing
really
was
her
effort
at
treating
the
matter
lightly
but
it
seems
more
important
to
me
than
it
would
to
any
one
with
with
a
family
the
people
i
live
with
who
have
been
so
kind
to
me
are
going
away
the
cupps
he
asked
she
turned
quite
round
to
look
at
him
how
she
faltered
did
you
know
about
them
maria
told
me
he
answered
i
asked
her
it
seemed
such
a
human
sort
of
interest
to
have
taken
in
her
she
could
not
understand
and
she
had
thought
he
scarcely
realised
her
existence
she
said
to
herself
that
was
so
often
the
case
people
were
so
much
kinder
than
one
knew
she
felt
the
moisture
welling
in
her
eyes
and
stared
steadily
at
the
heather
trying
to
wink
it
away
i
am
really
glad
she
explained
hastily
it
is
such
good
fortune
for
them
cupp
brother
has
offered
them
such
a
nice
home
they
need
never
be
anxious
again
but
they
will
leave
mortimer
street
and
you
will
have
to
give
up
your
room
yes
i
must
find
another
a
big
drop
got
the
better
of
her
and
flashed
on
its
way
down
her
cheek
i
can
find
a
room
perhaps
but
i
ca
find
she
was
obliged
to
clear
her
throat
that
was
why
you
cried
yes
after
which
she
sat
still
you
do
know
where
you
will
live
no
she
was
looking
so
straight
before
her
and
trying
so
hard
to
behave
discreetly
that
she
did
not
see
that
he
had
drawn
nearer
to
her
but
a
moment
later
she
realised
it
because
he
took
hold
of
her
hand
his
own
closed
over
it
firmly
will
you
he
said
i
came
here
in
fact
to
ask
you
if
you
will
come
and
live
with
me
her
heart
stood
still
quite
still
london
was
so
full
of
ugly
stories
about
things
done
by
men
of
his
rank
stories
of
transgressions
of
follies
of
cruelties
so
many
were
open
secrets
there
were
men
who
even
while
keeping
up
an
outward
aspect
of
respectability
were
held
accountable
for
painful
things
the
lives
of
struggling
women
were
so
hard
sometimes
such
nice
ones
went
under
because
temptation
was
so
great
but
she
had
not
thought
she
could
not
have
dreamed
she
got
on
her
feet
and
stood
upright
before
him
he
rose
with
her
and
because
she
was
a
tall
woman
their
eyes
were
on
a
level
her
own
big
and
honest
ones
were
wide
and
full
of
crystal
tears
oh
she
said
in
helpless
woe
oh
it
was
perhaps
the
most
effective
thing
a
woman
ever
did
it
was
so
simple
that
it
was
heartbreaking
she
could
not
have
uttered
a
word
he
was
such
a
powerful
and
great
person
and
she
was
so
without
help
or
stay
since
the
occurring
of
this
incident
she
has
often
been
spoken
of
as
a
beauty
and
she
has
without
doubt
had
her
fine
hours
but
walderhurst
has
never
told
her
that
the
most
beautiful
moment
of
her
life
was
undoubtedly
that
in
which
she
stood
upon
the
heather
tall
and
straight
and
simple
her
hands
hanging
by
her
sides
her
large
hazel
eyes
gazing
straight
into
his
in
the
femininity
of
her
frank
defencelessness
there
was
an
appeal
to
nature
self
in
man
which
was
not
quite
of
earth
and
for
several
seconds
they
stood
so
and
gazed
into
each
other
souls
the
usually
unilluminated
nobleman
and
the
prosaic
young
woman
who
lodged
on
a
third
floor
back
in
mortimer
street
then
quite
quickly
something
was
lighted
in
his
eyes
and
he
took
a
step
toward
her
good
heavens
he
demanded
what
do
you
suppose
i
am
asking
of
you
i
do
know
she
answered
i
do
know
my
good
girl
he
said
even
with
some
irritation
i
am
asking
you
to
be
my
wife
i
am
asking
you
to
come
and
live
with
me
in
an
entirely
respectable
manner
as
the
marchioness
of
walderhurst
emily
touched
the
breast
of
her
brown
linen
blouse
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
you
are
asking
she
said
yes
he
answered
his
glass
had
dropped
out
of
his
eye
and
he
picked
it
up
and
replaced
it
there
is
black
with
the
cart
he
said
i
will
explain
myself
with
greater
clearness
as
we
drive
back
to
mallowe
the
basket
of
fish
was
put
in
the
cart
and
emily
was
put
in
then
the
marquis
got
in
himself
and
took
the
reins
from
his
groom
you
will
walk
back
black
he
said
by
that
path
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
in
a
diverging
direction
as
they
drove
across
the
heather
emily
was
trembling
softly
from
head
to
foot
she
could
have
told
no
human
being
what
she
felt
only
a
woman
who
had
lived
as
she
had
lived
and
who
had
been
trained
as
she
had
been
trained
could
have
felt
it
the
brilliance
of
the
thing
which
had
happened
to
her
was
so
unheard
of
and
so
undeserved
she
told
herself
it
was
so
incredible
that
even
with
the
splendid
gray
mare
head
before
her
and
lord
walderhurst
by
her
side
she
felt
that
she
was
only
part
of
a
dream
men
had
never
said
things
to
her
and
a
man
was
saying
them
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
was
saying
them
they
were
not
the
kind
of
things
every
man
says
or
said
in
every
man
way
but
they
so
moved
her
soul
that
she
quaked
with
joy
i
am
not
a
marrying
man
said
his
lordship
but
i
must
marry
and
i
like
you
better
than
any
woman
i
have
ever
known
i
do
not
generally
like
women
i
am
a
selfish
man
and
i
want
an
unselfish
woman
most
women
are
as
selfish
as
i
am
myself
i
used
to
like
you
when
i
heard
maria
speak
of
you
i
have
watched
you
and
thought
of
you
ever
since
i
came
here
you
are
necessary
to
every
one
and
you
are
so
modest
that
you
know
nothing
about
it
you
are
a
handsome
woman
and
you
are
always
thinking
of
other
women
good
looks
emily
gave
a
soft
little
gasp
but
lady
agatha
she
said
i
was
sure
it
was
lady
agatha
i
do
want
a
girl
returned
his
lordship
a
girl
would
bore
me
to
death
i
am
not
going
to
a
girl
at
the
age
of
i
want
a
companion
but
i
am
so
from
clever
faltered
emily
the
marquis
turned
in
his
to
look
at
her
it
was
really
a
very
nice
look
he
gave
her
it
made
emily
cheeks
grow
pink
and
her
simple
heart
beat
you
are
the
woman
i
want
he
said
you
make
me
feel
quite
sentimental
when
they
reached
mallowe
emily
had
upon
her
finger
the
ruby
which
lady
maria
had
graphically
described
as
being
as
big
as
a
trouser
button
it
was
indeed
so
big
that
she
could
scarcely
wear
her
glove
over
it
she
was
still
incredible
but
she
was
blooming
like
a
large
rose
lord
walderhurst
had
said
so
many
things
to
her
that
she
seemed
to
behold
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
she
had
been
so
swept
off
her
feet
that
she
had
not
really
been
allowed
time
to
think
after
that
first
gasp
of
lady
agatha
when
she
reached
her
bedroom
she
almost
returned
to
earth
as
she
remembered
it
neither
of
them
had
dreamed
of
this
neither
of
them
what
could
she
say
to
lady
agatha
what
would
lady
agatha
say
to
her
though
it
had
not
been
her
fault
she
had
not
dreamed
that
such
a
thing
could
be
possible
how
could
she
oh
how
could
she
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
her
room
with
clasped
hands
there
was
a
knock
upon
the
door
and
lady
agatha
herself
came
to
her
what
had
occurred
something
it
was
to
be
seen
in
the
girl
eyes
and
in
a
certain
delicate
shyness
in
her
manner
something
very
nice
has
happened
she
said
something
nice
repeated
emily
lady
agatha
sat
down
the
letter
from
curzon
street
was
in
her
hand
half
unfolded
i
have
had
a
letter
from
mamma
it
seems
almost
bad
taste
to
speak
of
it
so
soon
but
we
have
talked
to
each
other
so
much
and
you
are
so
kind
that
i
want
to
tell
you
myself
sir
bruce
norman
has
been
to
talk
to
papa
about
about
me
emily
felt
that
her
cup
filled
to
the
brim
at
the
moment
he
is
in
england
again
agatha
nodded
gently
he
only
went
away
to
well
to
test
his
own
feelings
before
he
spoke
mamma
is
delighted
with
him
i
am
going
home
emily
made
a
little
swoop
forward
you
always
liked
him
she
said
lady
agatha
delicate
mounting
colour
was
adorable
i
was
quite
she
owned
and
hid
her
lovely
face
in
her
hands
in
the
lord
walderhurst
was
talking
to
lady
maria
you
need
not
give
emily
any
more
clothes
maria
he
said
i
am
going
to
supply
her
in
future
i
have
asked
her
to
marry
me
lady
maria
lightly
gasped
and
then
began
to
laugh
well
james
she
said
you
have
certainly
much
more
sense
than
most
men
of
your
rank
and
age
part
two
chapter
seven
when
miss
emily
was
preparing
for
the
extraordinary
change
in
her
life
which
transformed
her
from
a
very
poor
hardworking
woman
into
one
of
the
richest
marchionesses
in
england
lord
walderhurst
cousin
lady
maria
bayne
was
extremely
good
to
her
she
gave
her
advice
and
though
advice
is
a
cheap
present
as
far
as
the
giver
is
concerned
there
are
occasions
when
it
may
be
a
very
valuable
one
to
the
recipient
lady
maria
was
valuable
to
emily
who
had
but
one
difficulty
which
was
to
adjust
herself
to
the
marvellous
fortune
which
had
befallen
her
there
was
a
certain
thing
emily
found
herself
continually
saying
it
used
to
break
from
her
lips
when
she
was
alone
in
her
room
when
she
was
on
her
way
to
her
dressmaker
and
in
spite
of
herself
sometimes
when
she
was
with
her
whilom
patroness
i
ca
believe
it
is
true
i
ca
believe
it
i
do
wonder
my
dear
girl
lady
maria
answered
the
second
time
she
heard
it
but
what
circumstances
demand
of
you
is
that
you
should
learn
to
yes
said
emily
i
know
i
must
but
it
seems
like
a
dream
sometimes
passing
her
hand
over
her
forehead
with
a
little
laugh
i
feel
as
if
i
should
suddenly
find
myself
wakened
in
the
room
in
mortimer
street
by
jane
cupp
bringing
in
my
morning
tea
and
i
can
see
the
wallpaper
and
the
cotton
curtains
one
of
them
was
an
inch
or
so
too
short
i
never
could
afford
to
buy
the
new
bit
though
i
always
intended
to
how
much
was
the
stuff
a
yard
lady
maria
inquired
sevenpence
how
many
yards
did
you
need
two
it
would
have
cost
one
and
twopence
you
see
and
i
really
could
get
on
without
it
lady
maria
put
up
her
lorgnette
and
looked
at
her
protégée
with
an
interest
which
bordered
on
affection
it
was
so
enjoyable
to
her
epicurean
old
mind
i
did
suspect
it
was
as
bad
as
that
emily
she
said
i
should
never
have
dreamed
it
you
managed
to
do
yourself
with
such
astonishing
decency
you
were
actually
nice
always
i
was
very
much
poorer
than
anyone
knew
said
emily
people
like
one
troubles
and
when
one
is
earning
one
living
as
i
was
one
must
be
agreeable
you
know
it
would
never
do
to
seem
tiresome
there
cleverness
in
realising
that
fact
said
lady
maria
you
were
always
the
most
cheerful
creature
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
walderhurst
admired
you
the
future
marchioness
blushed
all
over
lady
maria
saw
even
her
neck
itself
blush
and
it
amused
her
ladyship
greatly
she
was
intensely
edified
by
the
fact
that
emily
could
be
made
to
blush
by
the
mere
mention
of
her
mature
fiancé
name
she
in
such
a
state
of
mind
about
the
man
that
she
delightful
was
the
old
woman
internal
reflection
i
believe
she
in
love
with
him
as
if
she
was
a
and
he
was
a
butcher
boy
you
see
emily
went
on
in
her
nice
confiding
way
one
of
the
most
surprising
privileges
of
her
new
position
was
that
it
made
it
possible
for
her
to
confide
in
old
lady
maria
it
was
not
only
the
living
from
day
to
day
that
made
one
anxious
it
was
the
future
lady
maria
knew
that
the
word
began
in
this
case
with
a
capital
letter
no
one
knows
what
the
future
is
to
poor
women
one
knows
that
one
must
get
older
and
one
may
not
keep
well
and
if
one
could
not
be
active
and
in
good
spirits
if
one
could
not
run
about
on
errands
and
things
fell
off
could
one
do
it
takes
hard
work
lady
maria
to
keep
up
even
the
tiniest
nice
little
room
and
the
plainest
presentable
wardrobe
if
one
is
clever
if
i
had
been
clever
it
would
have
been
quite
different
i
dare
say
i
have
been
so
frightened
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
i
wakened
and
thought
about
living
to
be
that
i
have
lain
and
shaken
all
over
you
see
her
blush
had
so
far
disappeared
that
she
looked
for
the
moment
pale
at
the
memory
i
had
nobody
nobody
and
now
you
are
going
to
be
the
marchioness
of
walderhurst
remarked
lady
maria
emily
hands
which
rested
on
her
knee
wrung
themselves
together
that
is
what
it
seems
impossible
to
believe
she
said
or
to
be
grateful
enough
for
to
to
and
she
blushed
all
over
again
say
put
in
lady
maria
with
a
sinful
if
amiable
sense
of
comedy
you
will
have
to
get
accustomed
to
thinking
of
him
as
sometimes
at
all
events
but
emily
did
not
say
james
there
was
something
interesting
in
the
innocent
fineness
of
her
feeling
for
lord
walderhurst
in
the
midst
of
her
bewildered
awe
and
pleasure
at
the
material
splendours
looming
up
in
her
horizon
her
soul
was
filled
with
a
tenderness
as
exquisite
as
the
religion
of
a
child
it
was
a
combination
of
intense
gratitude
and
the
guileless
passion
of
a
hitherto
wholly
unawakened
woman
a
woman
who
had
not
hoped
for
love
or
allowed
her
thoughts
to
dwell
upon
it
and
who
therefore
had
no
clear
understanding
of
its
full
meaning
she
could
not
have
explained
her
feeling
if
she
had
tried
and
she
did
not
dream
of
trying
if
a
person
less
inarticulate
than
herself
had
translated
it
to
her
she
would
have
been
amazed
and
abashed
so
would
lord
walderhurst
have
been
amazed
so
would
lady
maria
but
her
ladyship
amazement
would
have
expressed
itself
after
its
first
opening
of
the
eyes
with
a
faint
elderly
chuckle
when
miss
had
returned
to
town
she
had
returned
with
lady
maria
to
south
audley
street
the
mortimer
street
episode
was
closed
as
was
the
cupps
house
cupp
and
jane
had
gone
to
chichester
jane
leaving
behind
her
a
letter
the
really
meritorious
neatness
of
which
was
blotted
by
two
or
three
distinct
tears
jane
respectfully
expressed
her
affectionate
rapture
at
the
wondrous
news
which
modern
society
had
revealed
to
her
before
miss
herself
had
time
to
do
so
i
am
afraid
miss
she
ended
her
epistle
that
i
am
not
experienced
enough
to
serve
a
lady
in
a
grand
position
but
hoping
it
is
not
a
liberty
to
ask
it
if
at
any
time
your
own
maid
should
be
wanting
a
young
woman
to
work
under
her
i
should
be
grateful
to
be
remembered
perhaps
having
learned
your
ways
and
being
a
good
needlewoman
and
fond
of
it
might
be
a
little
recommendation
for
me
i
like
to
take
jane
for
my
maid
emily
had
said
to
lady
maria
do
you
think
i
might
make
her
do
she
would
probably
be
worth
half
a
dozen
french
minxes
who
would
amuse
themselves
by
getting
up
intrigues
with
your
footmen
was
lady
astute
observation
i
would
pay
an
extra
ten
pounds
a
year
myself
for
slavish
affection
if
it
was
to
be
obtained
at
agency
offices
send
her
to
a
french
hairdresser
to
take
a
course
of
lessons
and
she
will
be
worth
anything
to
turn
you
out
perfectly
will
be
her
life
ambition
to
jane
cupp
rapture
the
next
post
brought
her
the
following
letter
dear
jane
it
is
just
like
you
to
write
such
a
nice
letter
to
me
and
i
can
assure
you
i
appreciated
all
your
good
wishes
very
much
i
feel
that
i
have
been
most
fortunate
and
am
of
course
very
happy
i
have
spoken
to
lady
maria
bayne
about
you
and
she
thinks
that
you
might
make
me
a
useful
maid
if
i
gave
you
the
advantage
of
a
course
of
lessons
in
hairdressing
i
myself
know
that
you
would
be
faithful
and
interested
and
that
i
could
not
have
a
more
trustworthy
young
woman
if
your
mother
is
willing
to
spare
you
i
will
engage
you
the
wages
would
be
pounds
a
year
and
beer
of
course
to
begin
with
and
an
increase
later
as
you
became
more
accustomed
to
your
duties
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
your
mother
is
so
well
and
comfortable
remember
me
to
her
kindly
yours
truly
emily
jane
cupp
trembled
and
turned
pale
with
joy
as
she
read
her
letter
oh
mother
she
said
breathless
with
happiness
and
to
think
she
is
almost
a
marchioness
this
very
minute
i
wonder
if
i
shall
go
with
her
to
oswyth
castle
first
or
to
mowbray
or
to
hurst
my
word
said
cupp
you
are
in
luck
jane
being
as
you
rather
be
a
lady
maid
than
live
private
in
chichester
you
need
go
out
to
service
you
know
your
uncle
always
ready
to
provide
for
you
i
know
he
is
answered
jane
a
little
nervous
lest
obstacles
might
be
put
in
the
way
of
her
achieving
her
ambition
and
kind
of
him
and
i
sure
i
grateful
but
though
i
would
hurt
his
feelings
by
mentioning
it
it
is
more
independent
to
be
earning
your
own
living
and
there
more
you
see
in
waiting
on
a
titled
lady
and
dressing
her
for
and
parties
and
races
and
things
and
travelling
about
with
her
to
the
grand
places
she
lives
in
and
visits
why
mother
i
heard
tell
that
the
society
in
the
servants
halls
is
almost
like
high
life
butlers
and
footmen
and
maids
to
high
people
has
seen
so
much
of
the
world
and
get
such
manners
do
you
remember
how
quiet
and
elegant
susan
hill
was
that
was
maid
to
lady
cosbourne
and
she
been
to
greece
and
to
india
if
miss
likes
travel
and
his
lordship
likes
it
i
may
be
taken
to
all
sorts
of
wonderful
places
just
think
she
gave
cupp
a
little
clutch
in
her
excitement
she
had
always
lived
in
the
basement
kitchen
of
a
house
in
mortimer
street
and
had
never
had
reason
to
hope
she
might
leave
it
and
now
you
right
jane
her
mother
said
shaking
her
head
there
a
great
deal
in
it
particular
when
you
young
there
a
great
deal
in
it
when
the
engagement
of
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
had
been
announced
to
the
consternation
of
many
lady
maria
had
been
in
her
element
she
was
really
fine
at
times
in
her
attitude
towards
the
indiscreetly
or
tactlessly
inquiring
her
management
of
lady
malfry
in
particular
had
been
a
delightful
thing
on
hearing
of
her
niece
engagement
lady
malfry
had
naturally
awakened
to
a
proper
and
if
belated
interest
in
her
she
did
not
fling
herself
upon
her
breast
after
the
manner
of
worldly
aunts
in
ancient
comedies
in
which
cinderella
attains
fortune
she
wrote
a
letter
of
congratulation
after
which
she
called
at
south
audley
street
and
with
not
too
great
obviousness
placed
herself
and
her
house
at
the
disposal
of
such
female
relatives
as
required
protection
during
the
period
of
their
preparation
for
becoming
marchionesses
she
herself
could
not
have
explained
exactly
how
it
was
that
without
being
put
through
any
particular
process
she
understood
before
her
call
was
half
over
that
emily
intention
was
to
remain
with
lady
maria
bayne
and
that
lady
maria
intention
was
to
keep
her
the
scene
between
the
three
was
far
too
subtle
to
be
of
the
least
use
upon
the
stage
but
it
was
a
good
scene
nevertheless
its
expression
was
chiefly
perhaps
a
matter
of
inclusion
and
exclusion
and
may
also
have
been
largely
telepathic
but
after
it
was
over
lady
maria
chuckled
several
times
softly
to
herself
like
an
elderly
bird
of
much
humour
and
lady
malfry
went
home
feeling
exceedingly
cross
she
was
in
so
perturbed
a
humour
that
she
dropped
her
eyelids
and
looked
rather
coldly
down
the
bridge
of
her
nose
when
her
stupidly
cheery
little
elderly
husband
said
to
her
well
geraldine
i
beg
pardon
she
replied
i
do
quite
understand
of
course
you
do
how
about
emily
she
seems
very
well
and
of
course
she
is
well
satisfied
it
would
not
be
possible
for
her
to
be
otherwise
lady
maria
bayne
has
taken
her
up
she
is
walderhurst
cousin
well
well
it
will
be
an
immense
position
for
the
girl
immense
granted
lady
malfry
with
a
little
flush
a
certain
tone
in
her
voice
conveyed
that
discussion
was
terminated
sir
george
knew
that
her
niece
was
not
coming
to
them
and
that
the
immense
position
would
include
themselves
but
slightly
emily
was
established
temporarily
at
south
audley
street
with
jane
cupp
as
her
maid
she
was
to
be
married
from
lady
maria
lean
old
arms
so
to
speak
her
ladyship
derived
her
usual
epicurean
enjoyment
from
the
whole
thing
from
too
obviously
thwarted
mothers
and
daughters
from
walderhurst
who
received
congratulations
with
a
civilly
inexpressive
countenance
which
usually
baffled
the
observer
from
emily
who
was
overwhelmed
by
her
emotions
and
who
was
of
a
candour
in
action
such
as
might
have
appealed
to
any
heart
not
adapted
by
the
flintiness
of
its
nature
to
the
macadamising
of
roads
if
she
had
not
been
of
the
most
unpretentious
nice
breeding
and
unaffected
taste
emily
might
have
been
ingenuously
funny
in
her
process
of
transformation
i
keep
forgetting
that
i
can
afford
things
she
said
to
lady
maria
yesterday
i
walked
such
a
long
way
to
match
a
piece
of
silk
and
when
i
was
tired
i
got
into
a
penny
bus
i
did
not
remember
until
it
was
too
late
that
i
ought
to
have
called
a
hansom
do
you
think
a
shade
anxiously
that
lord
walderhurst
would
mind
just
for
the
present
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
that
i
should
see
that
you
shop
in
the
carriage
her
ladyship
answered
with
a
small
grin
when
you
are
a
marchioness
you
may
make
penny
buses
a
feature
of
the
distinguished
of
your
character
if
you
like
i
myself
because
they
jolt
and
stop
to
pick
up
people
but
you
can
with
originality
and
distinction
if
it
amuses
you
it
does
said
emily
i
hate
them
i
have
longed
to
be
able
to
take
hansoms
oh
how
i
have
when
i
was
tired
the
legacy
left
her
by
old
maytham
had
been
realised
and
deposited
as
a
solid
sum
in
a
bank
since
she
need
no
longer
hoard
the
income
of
twenty
pounds
a
year
it
was
safe
to
draw
upon
her
capital
for
her
present
needs
the
fact
made
her
feel
comfortable
she
could
make
her
preparations
for
the
change
in
her
life
with
a
decent
independence
she
would
have
been
definitely
unhappy
if
she
had
been
obliged
to
accept
favours
at
this
juncture
she
felt
as
if
she
could
scarcely
have
borne
it
it
seemed
as
if
everything
conspired
to
make
her
comfortable
as
well
as
blissfully
happy
in
these
days
lord
walderhurst
found
an
interest
in
watching
her
and
her
methods
he
was
a
man
who
in
certain
respects
knew
himself
very
well
and
had
few
illusions
respecting
his
own
character
he
had
always
been
rather
given
to
analysis
of
his
own
emotions
and
at
mallowe
he
had
once
or
twice
asked
himself
if
it
was
not
disagreeably
possible
that
the
first
moderate
glow
of
his
martin
summer
might
die
away
and
leave
him
feeling
slightly
fatigued
and
embarrassed
by
the
new
aspect
of
his
previously
regular
and
entirely
existence
you
might
think
that
you
would
like
to
marry
a
woman
and
then
you
might
realise
that
there
were
objections
that
even
the
woman
herself
with
all
her
desirable
qualities
might
be
an
objection
in
the
end
that
any
woman
might
be
an
objection
in
fact
that
it
required
an
effort
to
reconcile
oneself
to
the
fact
of
a
woman
being
continually
about
of
course
the
arriving
at
such
a
conclusion
after
one
had
committed
oneself
would
be
annoying
walderhurst
had
in
fact
only
reflected
upon
this
possible
aspect
of
affairs
he
had
driven
over
the
heath
to
pick
emily
up
afterwards
he
had
in
some
remote
portion
of
his
mentality
vaguely
awaited
developments
when
he
saw
emily
day
by
day
at
south
audley
street
he
found
he
continued
to
like
her
he
was
not
clever
enough
to
analyse
her
he
could
only
watch
her
and
he
always
looked
on
at
her
with
curiosity
and
a
novel
sensation
rather
like
pleasure
she
wakened
up
at
sight
of
him
when
he
called
in
a
way
that
was
attractive
even
to
an
unimaginative
man
her
eyes
seemed
to
warm
and
she
often
looked
flushed
and
softly
appealing
he
began
to
note
vaguely
that
her
dresses
were
better
and
oftener
changed
than
they
had
been
at
mallowe
a
more
observant
man
might
have
been
touched
by
the
suggestion
that
she
was
unfolding
petal
by
petal
like
a
flower
and
that
each
carefully
chosen
costume
was
a
new
petal
he
did
not
in
the
least
suspect
the
reverent
eagerness
of
her
care
of
herself
as
an
object
hoping
to
render
itself
worthy
of
his
qualities
and
tastes
his
qualities
and
tastes
were
of
no
exalted
importance
in
themselves
but
they
seemed
so
to
emily
it
is
that
which
by
one
chance
or
another
so
commends
itself
to
a
creature
as
to
incite
it
to
the
emotion
called
love
which
is
really
of
importance
and
which
not
speaking
in
figures
holds
the
power
of
life
and
death
personality
sometimes
achieves
this
circumstances
always
aid
it
but
in
all
cases
the
result
is
the
same
and
sways
the
world
it
exists
in
during
its
existence
emily
had
fallen
deeply
and
touchingly
in
love
with
this
particular
prosaic
nobleman
and
her
whole
feminine
being
was
absorbed
in
her
adoration
of
him
her
tender
fancy
described
him
by
adjectives
such
as
no
other
human
being
would
have
assented
to
she
felt
that
he
had
condescended
to
her
with
a
generosity
which
justified
worship
this
was
not
true
but
it
was
true
for
her
as
a
consequence
of
this
she
thought
out
and
purchased
her
wardrobe
with
a
solemnity
of
purpose
such
as
might
well
have
been
part
of
a
religious
ceremonial
when
she
consulted
fashion
plates
and
lady
maria
or
when
she
ordered
a
gown
at
her
ladyship
dressmaker
she
had
always
before
her
mind
not
herself
but
the
marchioness
of
walderhurst
a
marchioness
of
walderhurst
whom
the
marquis
would
approve
of
and
be
pleased
with
she
did
not
expect
from
him
what
sir
bruce
norman
gave
to
lady
agatha
agatha
and
her
lover
were
of
a
different
world
she
saw
them
occasionally
not
often
because
the
simple
selfishness
of
young
love
so
absorbed
them
that
they
could
scarcely
realise
the
existence
of
other
persons
than
themselves
they
were
to
be
married
and
to
depart
for
fairyland
as
soon
as
possible
both
were
fond
of
travel
and
when
they
took
ship
together
their
intention
was
to
girdle
the
world
at
leisure
if
they
felt
so
inclined
they
could
do
anything
they
chose
and
were
so
blissfully
sufficient
for
each
other
that
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
not
follow
their
every
errant
fancy
the
lines
which
had
been
increasing
in
lady
claraway
face
had
disappeared
and
left
her
blooming
with
the
beauty
her
daughters
had
reproduced
this
delightful
marriage
had
smoothed
away
every
difficulty
sir
bruce
was
the
most
charming
fellow
in
england
that
fact
acted
as
a
charm
in
itself
it
seemed
it
was
not
necessary
to
go
into
details
as
to
the
mollifying
of
tradespeople
and
rearranging
of
the
entire
aspect
of
life
at
curzon
street
when
agatha
and
emily
met
in
town
for
the
first
time
it
was
in
the
drawing
room
at
south
audley
street
they
clasped
each
other
hands
with
an
exchange
of
entirely
new
looks
you
look
so
so
miss
said
agatha
with
actual
tenderness
if
she
had
not
been
afraid
of
seeming
a
little
rudely
effusive
she
would
have
said
handsome
instead
of
well
for
emily
was
sweetly
blooming
happiness
is
becoming
to
you
she
added
may
i
say
how
i
am
thank
you
thank
you
emily
answered
everything
in
the
world
seems
changed
does
it
yes
everything
they
stood
and
gazed
into
each
other
eyes
a
few
seconds
and
then
loosed
hands
with
a
little
laugh
and
sat
down
to
talk
it
was
in
fact
lady
agatha
who
talked
most
because
emily
led
her
on
and
aided
her
to
delicate
expansion
by
her
delight
in
all
that
in
these
days
made
up
her
existence
of
pure
bliss
it
was
as
if
an
fairy
story
were
being
enacted
before
emily
eyes
agatha
without
doubt
had
grown
lovelier
she
thought
she
seemed
even
fairer
more
willowy
the
eyes
were
of
a
happier
blue
as
growing
by
clear
are
bluer
than
those
grown
in
a
mere
garden
she
appeared
perhaps
even
a
little
taller
and
her
small
head
had
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
a
prettier
poise
this
at
least
emily
thought
and
found
her
own
happiness
added
to
by
her
belief
in
her
fancy
she
felt
that
nothing
was
to
be
wondered
at
when
she
heard
agatha
speak
of
sir
bruce
she
could
not
utter
his
name
or
refer
to
any
act
of
his
without
a
sound
in
her
voice
which
had
its
parallel
in
the
light
floating
haze
of
blush
on
her
cheeks
in
her
intercourse
with
the
world
in
general
she
would
have
been
able
to
preserve
her
customary
sweet
composure
but
emily
was
not
the
world
she
represented
a
something
which
was
so
primitively
of
the
emotions
that
one
heart
spoke
and
listened
to
her
agatha
was
conscious
that
miss
had
seen
at
mallowe
she
could
never
quite
understand
how
it
had
seemed
so
naturally
to
happen
a
phase
of
her
feelings
which
no
one
else
had
seen
before
bruce
had
seen
it
since
but
only
bruce
there
had
actually
been
a
sort
of
confidence
between
them
a
confidence
which
had
been
like
intimacy
though
neither
of
them
had
been
effusive
mamma
is
so
happy
the
girl
said
it
is
quite
wonderful
and
alix
and
hilda
and
millicent
and
eve
oh
it
makes
such
a
difference
to
them
i
shall
be
able
with
a
blush
which
expressed
a
world
of
relieved
affection
to
give
them
so
much
pleasure
any
girl
who
marries
happily
and
and
well
can
alter
everything
for
her
sisters
if
she
you
see
i
shall
have
reason
to
remember
i
know
things
from
experience
and
bruce
is
so
kind
and
gay
and
proud
of
their
prettiness
just
imagine
their
excitement
at
all
being
bridesmaids
bruce
says
we
shall
be
like
a
garden
of
spring
flowers
i
am
so
glad
her
eyes
suddenly
quite
heavenly
in
their
joyful
relief
that
he
is
the
next
second
the
heavenly
relieved
look
died
away
the
exclamation
had
been
involuntary
it
had
sprung
from
her
memory
of
the
days
when
she
had
dutifully
accepted
as
her
portion
the
possibility
of
being
smiled
upon
by
walderhurst
who
was
two
years
older
than
her
father
and
her
swift
realisation
of
this
fact
troubled
her
it
was
indelicate
to
have
referred
to
the
mental
image
even
ever
so
vaguely
but
emily
was
glad
too
that
sir
bruce
was
young
that
they
were
all
young
and
that
happiness
had
come
before
they
had
had
time
to
tire
of
waiting
for
it
she
was
so
happy
herself
that
she
questioned
nothing
yes
it
is
nice
she
answered
and
glowed
with
honest
sympathy
you
will
want
to
do
the
same
things
it
is
so
agreeable
when
people
who
are
married
like
to
do
the
same
things
perhaps
you
will
want
to
go
out
a
great
deal
and
to
travel
and
you
could
not
enjoy
it
if
sir
bruce
did
not
she
was
not
reflecting
in
the
least
upon
domestic
circles
whose
male
heads
are
capable
of
making
themselves
extremely
nasty
under
stress
of
invitations
it
bores
them
to
accept
and
the
inclination
of
wives
and
daughters
to
desire
acceptance
she
was
not
contemplating
with
any
premonitory
regrets
a
future
in
which
when
walderhurst
did
not
wish
to
go
out
to
dinner
or
disdained
a
ball
she
should
stay
at
home
far
from
it
she
simply
rejoiced
with
lady
agatha
who
was
marrying
you
are
not
like
me
she
explained
further
i
have
had
to
work
so
hard
and
contrive
so
closely
that
will
be
a
pleasure
to
me
just
to
know
that
i
need
starve
to
death
or
go
into
the
workhouse
is
such
a
relief
that
oh
exclaimed
lady
agatha
quickly
and
involuntarily
laying
a
hand
on
hers
startled
by
the
fact
that
she
spoke
as
if
referring
to
a
wholly
possibility
emily
smiled
realising
her
feeling
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
said
that
i
forgot
but
such
things
are
possible
when
one
is
too
old
to
work
and
has
nothing
to
depend
on
you
could
scarcely
understand
when
one
is
very
poor
one
is
frightened
because
occasionally
one
can
not
help
thinking
of
it
but
now
now
oh
how
different
exclaimed
agatha
with
heartfelt
earnestness
yes
now
i
need
never
be
afraid
it
makes
me
so
grateful
to
lord
walderhurst
her
neck
grew
pink
as
she
said
it
just
as
lady
maria
had
seen
it
grow
pink
on
previous
occasions
moderate
as
the
words
were
they
expressed
ardour
lord
walderhurst
came
in
half
an
hour
later
and
found
her
standing
smiling
by
the
window
you
look
particularly
well
emily
it
that
white
frock
i
suppose
you
ought
to
wear
a
good
deal
of
white
he
said
i
will
emily
answered
he
observed
that
she
wore
the
nice
flush
and
the
soft
appealing
look
as
well
as
the
white
frock
i
wish
here
she
stopped
feeling
a
little
foolish
what
do
you
wish
i
wish
i
could
do
more
to
please
you
than
wear
white
or
black
when
you
like
he
gazed
at
her
always
through
the
single
eyeglass
even
the
vaguest
approach
to
emotion
or
sentiment
invariably
made
him
feel
stiff
and
shy
realising
this
he
did
not
quite
understand
why
he
rather
liked
it
in
the
case
of
emily
though
he
only
liked
it
remotely
and
felt
his
own
inaptness
a
shade
absurd
wear
yellow
or
pink
occasionally
he
said
with
a
brief
awkward
laugh
what
large
honest
eyes
the
creature
had
like
a
fine
retriever
or
those
of
some
nice
animal
one
saw
in
the
zoo
i
will
wear
anything
you
like
she
said
the
nice
eyes
meeting
his
not
the
least
stupidly
he
reflected
though
women
who
were
affectionate
often
looked
stupid
i
will
do
anything
you
like
you
do
know
what
you
have
done
for
me
lord
walderhurst
they
moved
a
trifle
nearer
to
each
other
this
inarticulate
pair
he
dropped
his
eyeglass
and
patted
her
shoulder
say
or
or
or
dear
he
said
we
are
going
to
be
married
you
know
and
he
found
himself
going
to
the
length
of
kissing
her
cheek
with
some
warmth
i
sometimes
wish
she
said
feelingly
that
it
was
the
fashion
to
say
lord
as
lady
castlewood
used
to
do
in
i
always
thought
it
nice
women
are
not
so
respectful
to
their
husbands
in
these
days
he
answered
with
his
short
laugh
and
men
are
not
so
dignified
lord
castlewood
was
not
very
dignified
was
he
he
chuckled
a
little
no
but
his
rank
was
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
these
are
democratic
days
i
call
you
lady
if
you
like
oh
no
no
with
fervour
i
was
thinking
of
anything
like
that
i
know
you
were
not
he
reassured
her
you
are
not
that
kind
of
woman
oh
how
i
be
could
that
why
i
like
you
then
he
began
to
tell
her
his
reason
for
calling
at
this
particular
hour
he
came
to
prepare
her
for
a
visit
from
the
osborns
who
had
actually
just
returned
from
india
captain
osborn
had
chosen
or
chance
had
chosen
for
him
this
particular
time
for
a
long
leave
as
soon
as
she
heard
the
name
of
osborn
emily
heart
beat
a
little
quickly
she
had
naturally
learned
a
good
deal
of
detail
from
lady
maria
since
her
engagement
alec
osborn
was
the
man
who
since
lord
becoming
a
widower
had
lived
in
the
gradually
strengthening
belief
that
the
chances
were
that
it
would
be
his
enormous
luck
to
inherit
the
title
and
estates
of
the
present
marquis
of
walderhurst
he
was
not
a
very
near
relation
but
he
was
the
next
of
kin
he
was
a
young
man
and
a
strong
one
and
walderhurst
was
and
could
not
be
called
robust
his
medical
man
did
not
consider
him
a
particularly
good
life
though
he
was
not
often
he
not
the
kind
of
chap
who
lives
to
be
a
hundred
and
fifty
i
say
that
for
him
alec
osborn
had
said
at
mess
after
dinner
had
made
him
careless
of
speech
and
he
had
grinned
not
too
pleasantly
when
he
uttered
the
words
the
only
thing
that
would
completely
wipe
my
eye
is
as
likely
to
happen
to
him
as
to
most
men
he
unsentimental
and
level
headed
and
does
like
marriage
you
can
imagine
how
chivied
by
women
a
fellow
in
his
position
could
be
let
alone
but
he
does
like
marriage
and
he
a
man
who
knows
jolly
well
what
he
likes
and
what
he
does
the
only
child
died
and
if
he
does
marry
again
i
in
a
safe
place
good
lord
the
difference
it
would
make
and
his
grin
extended
itself
it
was
three
months
after
this
that
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
followed
emily
out
upon
the
heath
and
finding
her
sitting
footsore
and
depressed
in
spirit
beside
the
basket
of
lady
maria
fish
asked
her
to
marry
him
when
the
news
reached
him
alec
osborn
went
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
quarters
and
blasphemed
until
his
face
was
purple
and
big
drops
of
sweat
ran
down
it
it
was
black
bad
luck
it
was
black
bad
luck
and
it
called
for
black
curses
what
the
articles
of
furniture
in
the
room
in
the
bungalow
heard
was
rather
awful
but
captain
osborn
did
not
feel
that
it
did
justice
to
the
occasion
when
her
husband
strode
by
her
to
his
apartment
osborn
did
not
attempt
to
follow
him
she
had
only
been
married
two
years
but
she
knew
his
face
too
well
and
she
also
knew
too
well
all
the
meaning
of
the
fury
contained
in
the
words
he
flung
at
her
as
he
hurled
himself
past
her
walderhurst
is
going
to
be
married
osborn
ran
into
her
own
room
and
sat
down
clutching
at
her
hair
as
she
dropped
her
face
in
her
little
dark
hands
she
was
an
girl
who
had
never
been
home
and
had
not
had
much
luck
in
life
at
any
time
and
her
worst
luck
had
been
in
being
handed
over
by
her
people
to
this
particular
man
chiefly
because
he
was
the
next
of
kin
to
lord
walderhurst
she
was
a
curious
passionate
creature
and
had
been
in
love
with
him
in
her
way
her
family
had
been
poor
and
barely
decently
disreputable
she
had
lived
on
the
outskirts
of
things
full
of
intense
girlish
vanity
and
yearnings
for
social
recognition
poorly
dressed
passed
over
and
snubbed
by
people
she
aspired
to
know
socially
seeing
other
girls
with
less
beauty
and
temperament
enjoying
flirtations
with
smart
young
officers
biting
her
tongue
out
with
envy
and
bitterness
of
thwarted
spirit
so
when
captain
osborn
cast
an
eye
on
her
and
actually
began
a
sentimental
episode
her
relief
and
excitement
at
finding
herself
counting
as
other
girls
did
wrought
itself
up
into
a
passion
her
people
were
prompt
and
sharp
enough
to
manage
the
rest
and
osborn
was
married
before
he
knew
exactly
whither
he
was
tending
he
was
not
pleased
with
himself
when
he
wakened
to
face
facts
he
could
only
console
himself
for
having
been
cleverly
led
and
driven
into
doing
the
thing
he
did
not
want
to
do
by
the
facts
that
the
girl
was
interesting
and
clever
and
had
a
good
deal
of
odd
beauty
it
was
a
beauty
so
that
it
would
perhaps
appear
to
its
greatest
advantage
in
the
contrasts
afforded
by
life
in
england
she
was
so
dark
of
heavy
hair
and
eyes
and
fine
grained
skin
and
so
sinuous
of
lithe
slim
body
that
among
native
beauties
she
seemed
not
to
be
sufficiently
separated
by
marks
of
race
she
had
tumbled
up
from
childhood
among
native
servants
who
were
almost
her
sole
companions
and
who
had
taught
her
curious
things
she
knew
their
stories
and
songs
and
believed
in
more
of
their
occult
beliefs
than
any
but
herself
knew
she
knew
things
which
made
her
interesting
to
alec
osborn
who
had
a
bullet
head
and
a
cruel
lower
jaw
despite
a
degree
of
the
ordinary
good
looks
the
fact
that
his
chances
were
good
for
becoming
marquis
of
walderhurst
and
taking
her
home
to
a
life
of
english
luxury
and
splendour
was
a
thing
she
never
forgot
it
haunted
her
in
her
sleep
she
had
often
dreamed
of
oswyth
castle
and
of
standing
amidst
great
people
on
the
broad
lawns
her
husband
had
described
feelingly
during
tropical
days
when
they
had
sat
together
panting
for
breath
when
there
had
been
mention
made
of
the
remote
awful
possibility
that
walderhurst
might
surrender
to
the
siege
laid
to
him
she
had
turned
sick
at
the
thought
it
made
her
clench
her
hands
until
the
nails
almost
pressed
into
the
skin
of
her
palms
she
could
not
bear
it
she
had
made
osborn
burst
into
a
big
harsh
laugh
one
day
when
she
had
hinted
to
him
that
there
were
occult
things
to
be
done
which
might
prevent
ill
luck
he
had
laughed
first
and
scowled
afterwards
cynically
saying
that
she
might
as
well
be
working
them
up
he
had
not
come
out
to
india
followed
by
regrets
and
affection
he
had
been
a
black
sheep
at
home
and
had
rather
been
hustled
away
than
otherwise
if
he
had
been
a
more
admirable
kind
of
fellow
walderhurst
would
certainly
have
made
him
an
allowance
but
his
manner
of
life
had
been
such
as
the
marquis
had
no
patience
with
in
men
of
any
class
and
especially
abhorred
in
men
whom
the
accident
of
birth
connected
with
good
names
he
had
not
been
lavish
in
his
demonstrations
of
interest
in
the
young
man
osborn
personableness
was
not
of
a
kind
attractive
to
the
unbiassed
male
observer
men
saw
his
cruel
young
jowl
and
low
forehead
and
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
small
he
had
a
good
swaggering
military
figure
to
which
uniform
was
becoming
and
a
kind
of
animal
good
looks
which
would
deteriorate
early
his
colour
would
fix
and
deepen
with
the
aid
of
steady
daily
drinking
and
his
features
would
coarsen
and
blur
until
by
the
time
he
was
forty
the
young
jowl
would
have
grown
heavy
and
would
end
by
being
his
most
prominent
feature
while
he
had
remained
in
england
walderhurst
had
seen
him
occasionally
and
had
only
remarked
and
heard
unpleasant
things
of
him
a
tendency
to
selfish
bad
manners
reckless
living
and
low
flirtation
he
once
saw
him
on
the
top
of
a
bus
with
his
arm
round
the
waist
of
an
awful
giggling
kind
of
person
who
was
adorned
with
tremendous
feathers
and
a
thick
fringe
coming
unfrizzled
with
the
heat
and
sticking
out
here
and
there
in
straight
locks
on
her
moist
forehead
osborn
thought
that
the
arm
business
had
been
cleverly
managed
with
such
furtiveness
that
no
one
could
see
it
but
walderhurst
was
driving
solemnly
by
in
his
respectable
barouche
and
he
found
himself
gazing
through
his
monocle
directly
at
his
relative
and
seeing
from
the
street
below
the
point
at
which
the
young
man
arm
lost
itself
under
the
profusely
beaded
short
cape
a
dull
flush
rose
to
his
countenance
and
he
turned
away
without
showing
any
sign
of
recognition
but
he
was
annoyed
and
disgusted
because
this
particular
kind
of
blatantly
vulgar
bad
taste
was
the
sort
of
thing
he
loathed
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
which
made
duchesses
of
women
who
did
alluring
turns
at
music
halls
or
sang
suggestive
songs
in
comic
opera
and
transformed
into
the
chatelaines
of
ancient
castles
young
persons
who
had
presided
at
the
ribbon
counter
he
saw
as
little
as
possible
of
his
heir
presumptive
after
this
and
if
the
truth
were
told
captain
alec
osborn
was
something
of
a
factor
in
the
affair
of
miss
emily
if
walderhurst
infant
son
had
lived
or
if
osborn
had
been
a
refined
even
if
dull
fellow
there
are
ten
chances
to
one
his
lordship
would
have
chosen
no
second
marchioness
captain
osborn
life
in
india
had
not
ended
in
his
making
no
further
debts
he
was
not
a
man
to
put
the
brake
on
in
the
matter
of
he
got
into
debt
so
long
as
a
shred
of
credit
remained
to
him
and
afterwards
he
tried
to
add
to
his
resources
by
cards
and
betting
at
races
he
made
and
lost
by
turn
and
was
in
a
desperate
state
when
he
got
his
leave
he
applied
for
it
because
he
had
conceived
the
idea
that
his
going
home
as
a
married
man
might
be
a
good
thing
for
him
hester
it
seemed
not
at
all
improbable
might
accomplish
something
with
walderhurst
if
she
talked
to
him
in
her
interesting
way
and
was
fervid
and
picturesque
in
her
storytelling
he
might
be
attracted
by
her
she
had
her
charm
and
when
she
lifted
the
heavy
lids
of
her
long
black
eyes
and
fixed
her
gaze
upon
her
hearer
as
she
talked
about
the
inner
side
of
native
life
of
which
she
knew
such
curious
intimate
things
people
always
listened
even
in
india
where
the
thing
was
not
so
much
of
a
novelty
and
in
england
she
might
be
a
sort
of
sensation
osborn
managed
to
convey
to
her
gradually
by
a
process
of
his
own
a
great
deal
of
what
he
wanted
her
to
do
during
the
months
before
the
matter
of
the
leave
was
quite
decided
he
dropped
a
word
here
and
there
which
carried
a
good
deal
of
suggestion
to
a
mind
used
to
seizing
on
passing
intimations
the
woman
who
had
been
hester
ayah
when
she
was
a
child
had
become
her
maid
she
was
a
woman
with
a
wide
silent
acquaintance
with
her
own
people
she
was
seldom
seen
talking
to
anyone
and
seldom
seemed
to
leave
the
house
but
she
always
knew
everything
her
mistress
was
aware
that
if
at
any
time
she
chose
to
ask
her
a
question
about
the
secret
side
of
things
concerning
black
or
white
peoples
she
would
receive
information
to
be
relied
upon
she
felt
that
she
could
have
heard
from
her
many
things
concerning
her
husband
past
present
and
future
and
that
the
matter
of
the
probable
succession
was
fully
comprehended
by
her
when
she
called
her
into
the
room
after
recovering
outwardly
from
her
hour
of
desperation
she
saw
that
the
woman
was
already
aware
of
the
blow
that
had
fallen
upon
the
household
what
they
said
to
each
other
need
not
be
recorded
here
but
there
was
more
in
the
conversation
than
the
mere
words
uttered
and
it
was
one
of
several
talks
held
before
osborn
sailed
for
england
with
her
husband
he
may
be
led
into
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
he
has
cut
the
ground
from
under
a
fellow
feet
and
left
him
dangling
in
the
air
said
osborn
to
his
wife
best
thing
will
be
to
make
friends
with
the
woman
hang
her
yes
alec
yes
hester
osborn
answered
just
a
little
feverishly
we
must
make
friends
with
her
they
say
she
is
a
good
sort
and
was
frightfully
poor
herself
she
wo
be
poor
now
hang
her
remarked
captain
osborn
with
added
fervour
i
should
like
to
break
her
neck
i
wonder
if
she
rides
i
sure
she
has
not
been
well
enough
off
to
do
anything
like
that
good
idea
to
begin
to
teach
her
and
he
laughed
as
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
began
to
walk
the
deck
with
a
fellow
passenger
it
was
these
people
lord
walderhurst
had
come
to
prepare
her
for
maria
has
told
you
about
them
i
know
he
said
i
dare
say
she
has
been
definite
enough
to
explain
that
i
consider
osborn
altogether
undesirable
under
the
veneer
of
his
knowledge
of
decent
customs
he
is
a
cad
i
am
obliged
to
behave
civilly
to
the
man
but
i
dislike
him
if
he
had
been
born
in
a
low
class
of
life
he
would
have
been
a
criminal
oh
emily
exclaimed
any
number
of
people
would
be
criminals
if
circumstances
did
not
interfere
it
depends
a
good
deal
on
the
shape
of
one
skull
oh
exclaimed
emily
again
do
you
think
so
she
believed
that
people
who
were
bad
were
bad
from
preference
though
she
did
not
at
all
understand
the
preference
she
had
accepted
from
her
childhood
everything
she
had
ever
heard
said
in
a
pulpit
that
walderhurst
should
propound
ideas
such
as
ministers
of
the
church
of
england
might
regard
as
heretical
startled
her
but
he
could
have
said
nothing
startling
enough
to
shake
her
affectionate
allegiance
yes
i
do
he
answered
osborn
skull
is
quite
the
wrong
shape
but
when
a
short
time
after
captain
osborn
brought
the
skull
in
question
into
the
room
covered
in
the
usual
manner
with
neatly
brushed
hair
emily
thought
it
a
very
nice
shape
indeed
perhaps
a
trifle
hard
and
and
low
of
forehead
but
not
shelving
or
bulging
as
the
heads
of
murderers
in
illustrated
papers
generally
did
she
owned
to
herself
that
she
did
not
see
what
lord
walderhurst
evidently
saw
but
then
she
did
not
expect
of
herself
an
intelligence
profound
enough
to
follow
his
superior
mental
flights
captain
osborn
was
well
groomed
and
well
mannered
and
his
demeanour
towards
herself
was
all
that
the
most
conventional
could
have
demanded
when
she
reflected
that
she
herself
represented
in
a
way
the
possible
destruction
of
his
hopes
of
magnificent
fortune
she
felt
almost
tenderly
towards
him
and
thought
his
easy
politeness
wonderful
osborn
too
how
interesting
and
how
beautiful
in
an
odd
way
osborn
was
every
movement
of
her
exceeding
slimness
was
curiously
graceful
emily
remembered
having
read
novels
whose
heroines
were
described
as
undulating
osborn
was
undulating
her
long
drooping
and
dense
black
eyes
were
quite
unlike
other
girls
eyes
emily
had
never
seen
anything
like
them
and
she
had
such
a
lonely
slow
shy
way
of
lifting
them
to
look
at
people
she
was
obliged
to
look
up
at
tall
emily
she
seemed
a
schoolgirl
as
she
stood
near
her
emily
was
the
kind
of
mistaken
creature
whose
conscience
awakening
to
unnecessary
remorses
causes
its
owner
at
once
to
assume
all
the
burdens
which
fate
has
laid
upon
the
shoulders
of
others
she
began
to
feel
like
a
criminal
herself
irrespective
of
the
shape
of
her
skull
her
own
inordinate
happiness
and
fortune
had
robbed
this
unoffending
young
couple
she
wished
that
it
had
not
been
so
and
vaguely
reproached
herself
without
reasoning
the
matter
out
to
a
conclusion
at
all
events
she
was
remorsefully
sympathetic
in
her
mental
attitude
towards
osborn
and
being
sure
that
she
was
frightened
of
her
husband
august
relative
felt
nervous
herself
because
lord
walderhurst
bore
himself
with
unrelated
courtesy
and
kept
his
monocle
fixed
in
his
eye
throughout
the
interview
if
he
had
let
it
drop
and
allowed
it
to
dangle
in
an
unbiassed
manner
from
its
cord
emily
would
have
felt
more
comfortable
because
she
was
sure
his
demeanour
would
have
appeared
a
degree
more
encouraging
to
the
osborns
are
you
glad
to
be
in
england
again
she
asked
osborn
i
never
was
here
before
answered
the
young
woman
i
have
never
been
anywhere
but
in
india
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
she
explained
that
she
had
not
been
a
delicate
child
and
also
conveyed
that
even
if
she
had
been
one
her
people
could
not
have
afforded
to
send
her
home
instinct
revealed
to
emily
that
she
had
not
had
many
of
the
good
things
of
life
and
that
she
was
not
a
creature
of
buoyant
spirits
the
fact
that
she
had
spent
a
good
many
hours
of
most
of
her
young
days
in
reflecting
on
her
had
left
its
traces
on
her
face
particularly
in
the
depths
of
her
black
eyes
they
had
come
it
appeared
in
the
course
of
duty
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
woman
who
was
to
be
their
destruction
to
have
neglected
to
do
so
would
have
made
them
seem
to
assume
an
indiscreet
attitude
towards
the
marriage
they
ca
like
it
of
course
lady
maria
summed
them
up
afterwards
but
they
have
made
up
their
minds
to
lump
it
as
respectably
as
possible
i
am
sorry
for
them
said
emily
of
course
you
are
and
you
will
probably
show
them
all
sorts
of
indiscreet
kindnesses
but
do
be
too
altruistic
my
good
emily
the
man
is
odious
and
the
girl
looks
like
a
native
beauty
she
rather
frightens
me
i
do
think
captain
osborn
is
odious
emily
answered
and
she
pretty
you
know
she
is
frightened
of
us
really
remembering
days
when
she
herself
had
been
at
a
disadvantage
with
people
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
be
of
importance
and
recalling
what
her
secret
tremor
before
them
had
been
emily
was
very
nice
indeed
to
little
osborn
she
knew
from
experience
things
which
would
be
of
use
to
her
things
about
lodgings
and
things
about
shops
osborn
had
taken
lodgings
in
duke
street
and
emily
knew
the
quarter
thoroughly
walderhurst
watched
her
being
nice
through
his
fixed
eyeglass
and
he
decided
that
she
had
really
a
very
good
manner
its
goodness
consisted
largely
in
its
directness
while
she
never
brought
forth
unnecessarily
recollections
of
the
days
when
she
had
done
other
people
shopping
and
had
purchased
for
herself
articles
at
sales
marked
she
was
interestingly
free
from
any
embarrassment
in
connection
with
the
facts
walderhurst
who
had
been
much
bored
by
himself
and
other
people
in
time
past
actually
found
that
it
gave
a
fillip
to
existence
to
look
on
at
a
woman
who
having
been
one
of
the
hardest
worked
of
the
genteel
labouring
classes
was
adapting
herself
to
the
role
of
marchioness
by
the
simplest
of
processes
and
making
a
very
nice
figure
at
it
too
in
her
entirely
unbrilliant
way
if
she
had
been
an
immensely
clever
woman
there
would
have
been
nothing
special
in
it
she
was
not
clever
at
all
yet
walderhurst
had
seen
her
produce
effects
such
as
a
clever
woman
might
have
laboured
for
and
only
attained
by
a
stroke
of
genius
as
for
instance
when
she
had
met
for
the
first
time
after
her
engagement
a
certain
particularly
detestable
woman
of
rank
to
whom
her
relation
to
walderhurst
was
peculiarly
bitter
the
duchess
of
merwold
had
counted
the
marquis
as
her
own
considering
him
fitted
by
nature
to
be
the
spouse
of
her
eldest
girl
a
fine
young
woman
with
projecting
teeth
who
had
hung
fire
she
felt
emily
incomprehensible
success
to
be
a
piece
of
impudent
presumption
and
she
had
no
reason
to
restrain
the
expression
of
her
sentiments
so
long
as
she
conveyed
them
by
methods
of
inference
and
inclusion
you
must
let
me
congratulate
you
very
warmly
miss
she
said
pressing
her
hand
with
maternal
patronage
your
life
has
changed
greatly
since
we
last
saw
each
other
very
greatly
indeed
emily
flushed
frankly
in
innocent
gratitude
as
she
answered
you
are
very
kind
thank
you
thank
you
yes
a
great
change
walderhurst
saw
that
her
smile
was
feline
and
asked
himself
what
the
woman
was
going
to
say
next
the
last
time
we
met
you
called
to
ask
me
about
the
shopping
you
were
to
do
for
me
do
you
remember
stockings
and
gloves
i
think
walderhurst
observed
that
she
expected
emily
to
turn
red
and
show
herself
at
a
loss
before
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
he
was
on
the
point
of
cutting
into
the
conversation
and
disposing
of
the
matter
himself
when
he
realised
that
emily
was
neither
gaining
colour
nor
losing
it
but
was
looking
honestly
into
her
grace
eyes
with
just
a
touch
of
ingenuous
regret
it
was
stockings
she
said
there
were
some
marked
down
to
one
and
elevenpence
halfpenny
at
barratt
they
were
really
good
for
the
price
and
you
wanted
four
pairs
and
when
i
got
there
they
were
all
gone
and
those
at
two
and
three
were
not
the
least
bit
better
i
was
so
disappointed
it
was
too
bad
walderhurst
fixed
his
monocle
firmly
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
verging
upon
a
cynical
grin
the
woman
was
known
to
be
the
stingiest
of
small
great
persons
in
london
her
economies
were
noted
and
this
incident
was
even
better
than
many
others
society
had
already
rejoiced
over
the
picture
raised
in
the
minds
of
the
hearers
of
her
grace
foiled
in
the
purchase
of
stockings
marked
down
to
would
be
a
source
of
rapture
for
some
time
to
come
and
emily
face
the
regretful
kindness
of
it
the
retrospective
sympathy
and
candid
feeling
it
was
incredibly
good
and
she
did
it
quite
by
accident
he
repeated
to
himself
in
his
inward
glee
she
did
it
quite
by
accident
she
not
clever
enough
to
have
done
it
on
purpose
what
a
brilliantly
witty
creature
she
would
be
if
she
had
invented
it
as
she
had
been
able
unreluctantly
to
recall
her
past
upon
this
occasion
so
she
was
able
to
draw
for
osborn
benefit
from
the
experience
it
had
afforded
her
she
wanted
to
make
up
to
her
in
such
ways
as
she
could
for
the
ill
turn
she
had
inadvertently
done
her
as
she
had
at
once
ranged
herself
as
an
aid
on
the
side
of
lady
agatha
so
she
ranged
herself
entirely
without
obtrusiveness
on
the
side
of
the
osborns
it
true
that
she
a
good
sort
hester
said
when
they
went
away
her
days
of
being
hard
up
are
not
far
enough
away
to
be
forgotten
she
has
any
affectation
at
any
rate
it
makes
it
easier
to
stand
her
she
looks
like
a
strong
woman
said
osborn
walderhurst
got
a
good
deal
for
his
money
she
make
a
strapping
british
matron
hester
winced
and
a
dusky
red
shot
up
in
her
cheek
so
she
will
she
sighed
it
was
quite
true
and
the
truer
it
was
the
worse
for
people
who
despairingly
hung
on
and
were
foolish
enough
to
hope
against
hope
chapter
eight
the
marriage
of
lady
agatha
came
first
and
was
a
sort
of
pageant
the
female
writers
for
fashion
papers
lived
upon
it
for
weeks
before
it
occurred
and
for
some
time
after
there
were
numberless
things
to
be
written
about
it
each
flower
of
the
garden
of
girls
was
to
be
described
with
her
bridesmaid
dress
and
the
exquisite
skin
and
eyes
and
hair
which
would
stamp
her
as
the
beauty
of
her
season
when
she
came
out
there
yet
remained
five
beauties
in
lady
claraway
possession
and
the
fifth
was
a
baby
thing
of
six
who
ravished
all
beholders
as
she
toddled
into
church
carrying
her
sister
train
aided
by
a
little
boy
page
in
white
velvet
and
point
lace
the
wedding
was
the
most
radiant
of
the
year
it
was
indeed
a
fairy
pageant
of
youth
and
beauty
and
happiness
and
hope
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
the
occasion
was
the
presence
of
the
future
marchioness
of
walderhurst
the
beautiful
miss
the
fashion
papers
were
very
strenuous
on
the
subject
of
emily
beauty
one
of
them
mentioned
that
the
height
and
pose
of
her
majestic
figure
and
the
cut
of
her
profile
suggested
the
venus
of
milo
jane
cupp
cut
out
every
paragraph
she
could
find
and
after
reading
them
aloud
to
her
young
man
sent
them
in
a
large
envelope
to
chichester
emily
faithfully
endeavouring
to
adjust
herself
to
the
demands
of
her
approaching
magnificence
was
several
times
alarmed
by
descriptions
of
her
charms
and
accomplishments
which
she
came
upon
accidentally
in
the
course
of
her
reading
of
various
periodicals
the
walderhurst
wedding
was
dignified
and
distinguished
but
not
radiant
the
emotions
emily
passed
through
during
the
day
from
her
awakening
almost
at
dawn
to
the
silence
of
her
bedroom
at
south
audley
street
until
evening
closed
in
upon
her
sitting
in
the
private
parlour
of
an
hotel
in
the
company
of
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
it
would
require
too
many
pages
to
describe
her
first
realisation
of
the
day
brought
with
it
the
physical
consciousness
that
her
heart
was
thumping
steadily
thumping
which
is
quite
a
different
matter
from
the
ordinary
beating
at
the
realisation
of
what
had
come
at
last
an
event
which
a
year
ago
the
wildest
dream
could
not
have
depicted
for
her
was
an
actual
fact
a
fortune
such
as
she
would
have
thought
of
with
awe
if
it
had
befallen
another
woman
had
befallen
her
unpretending
self
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
forehead
and
gasped
as
she
thought
of
it
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
get
accustomed
to
it
and
not
be
a
a
disappointment
she
said
oh
with
a
great
rising
wave
of
a
blush
how
good
of
him
how
can
i
she
lived
through
the
events
of
the
day
in
a
sort
of
dream
within
a
dream
when
jane
cupp
brought
her
tea
she
found
herself
involuntarily
making
a
mental
effort
to
try
to
look
as
if
she
was
really
awake
jane
who
was
an
emotional
creature
was
inwardly
so
shaken
by
her
feelings
that
she
herself
had
stood
outside
the
door
a
few
moments
biting
her
lips
to
keep
them
from
trembling
before
she
dared
entirely
trust
herself
to
come
in
her
hand
was
far
from
steady
as
she
set
down
the
tray
good
morning
jane
emily
said
by
way
of
trying
the
sound
of
her
voice
good
morning
miss
jane
answered
it
a
beautiful
morning
miss
i
hope
you
are
very
well
and
then
the
day
had
begun
afterwards
it
marched
on
with
solemn
thrill
and
stately
movement
through
hours
of
wondrous
preparation
for
an
imposing
function
through
the
splendid
gravity
of
the
function
itself
accompanied
by
brilliant
crowds
collected
and
looking
on
in
a
fashionable
church
and
motley
crowds
collected
to
look
on
outside
the
edifice
the
latter
pushing
and
jostling
each
other
and
commenting
in
more
or
less
respectful
if
excited
undertones
but
throughout
devouring
with
or
envious
eyes
great
people
whom
emily
had
only
known
through
the
frequent
mention
of
their
names
in
newspapers
or
through
their
relationship
or
intimacy
with
her
patrons
came
to
congratulate
her
in
her
rôle
of
bride
she
seemed
to
be
for
hours
the
centre
of
a
surging
changing
crowd
and
her
one
thought
was
to
bear
herself
with
an
outward
semblance
of
composure
no
one
but
herself
could
know
that
she
was
saying
internally
over
and
over
again
to
steady
herself
making
it
all
seem
real
i
am
being
married
this
is
my
wedding
i
am
emily
being
married
to
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
for
his
sake
i
must
not
look
stupid
or
excited
i
am
not
in
a
dream
how
often
she
said
this
after
the
ceremony
was
over
and
they
returned
to
south
audley
street
for
the
wedding
breakfast
could
scarcely
be
computed
when
lord
walderhurst
helped
her
from
the
carriage
and
she
stepped
on
to
the
strip
of
red
carpet
and
saw
the
crowd
on
each
side
of
it
and
the
coachman
and
footmen
with
their
big
white
wedding
favours
and
the
line
of
other
equipages
coming
up
her
head
whirled
that
the
marchioness
a
young
woman
with
a
bandbox
exclaimed
nudging
her
companion
that
looks
a
bit
pale
does
she
but
oh
gawd
look
at
them
an
pearls
jess
look
at
cried
the
other
wish
it
was
me
the
breakfast
seemed
splendid
and
glittering
and
long
people
seemed
splendid
and
glittering
and
far
off
and
by
the
time
emily
went
to
change
her
bridal
magnificence
for
her
travelling
costume
she
had
borne
as
much
strain
as
she
was
equal
to
she
was
devoutly
grateful
for
the
relief
of
finding
herself
alone
in
her
bedroom
with
jane
cupp
jane
she
said
you
know
exactly
how
many
minutes
i
can
dress
in
and
just
when
i
must
get
into
the
carriage
can
you
give
me
five
minutes
to
lie
down
quite
flat
and
dab
my
forehead
with
eau
de
cologne
five
minutes
jane
but
be
quite
sure
yes
miss
i
do
beg
pardon
my
lady
you
can
have
five
safe
she
took
no
more
jane
went
into
the
and
stood
near
its
door
holding
the
watch
in
her
hand
but
even
five
minutes
did
her
good
she
felt
less
delirious
when
she
descended
the
stairs
and
passed
through
the
crowds
again
on
lord
walderhurst
arm
she
seemed
to
walk
through
a
garden
in
resplendent
bloom
then
there
were
the
red
carpet
once
more
and
the
street
people
and
the
crowd
of
carriages
and
liveries
and
big
white
favours
inside
the
carriage
and
moving
away
to
the
echo
of
the
street
cheer
she
tried
to
turn
and
look
at
lord
walderhurst
with
an
unalarmed
if
faint
smile
well
he
said
with
the
originality
which
marked
him
it
is
really
over
yes
emily
agreed
with
him
and
i
never
can
forget
lady
goodness
walderhurst
gazed
at
her
with
a
dawning
inquiry
in
his
mind
he
himself
did
not
know
what
the
inquiry
was
but
it
was
something
a
trifle
stimulating
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
way
in
which
she
had
carried
herself
throughout
the
whole
thing
really
few
women
could
have
done
it
as
well
the
pale
violet
of
her
travelling
costume
which
was
touched
with
sable
was
becoming
to
her
fine
straight
figure
and
at
the
moment
her
eyes
rested
on
his
with
the
suggestion
of
trustful
appeal
despite
the
inelasticity
of
his
mind
he
vaguely
realised
his
bridegroom
honours
i
can
begin
now
he
said
with
stiff
lightness
if
such
a
paradox
can
be
to
address
you
as
the
man
in
esmond
addressed
his
wife
i
can
call
you
lady
oh
she
said
still
trying
to
smile
but
quivering
you
look
very
nice
he
said
upon
my
word
you
do
and
kissed
her
trembling
honest
mouth
almost
as
if
he
had
been
a
man
not
quite
but
almost
chapter
nine
they
began
the
new
life
at
palstrey
manor
which
was
ancient
and
most
beautiful
nothing
walderhurst
owned
was
as
perfect
an
example
of
olden
time
beauty
and
as
wonderful
for
that
reason
emily
almost
wept
before
the
loveliness
of
it
though
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
her
to
explain
or
particularise
the
grounds
for
her
emotion
she
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
venerable
wonders
of
the
architecture
to
her
the
place
looked
like
an
immense
rambling
fairy
palace
the
palace
of
some
sleeping
beauty
during
whose
hundred
years
of
slumber
rich
creepers
had
climbed
and
overgrown
its
walls
and
towers
enfolding
and
festooning
them
with
leaves
and
tendrils
and
actual
branches
the
huge
park
held
an
enchanted
forest
of
trees
the
long
avenue
of
giant
limes
their
writhen
limbs
arching
and
interlocking
their
writhen
roots
deep
in
velvet
moss
was
an
approach
suited
to
a
fairy
story
during
her
first
month
at
palstrey
emily
went
about
still
in
her
dream
it
became
more
a
dream
every
day
the
old
house
was
part
of
it
the
endless
rooms
the
wonderful
corridors
the
gardens
with
their
revelations
of
winding
walks
labyrinths
of
evergreens
and
grass
paths
leading
into
beautiful
unexpected
places
where
one
suddenly
came
upon
deep
clear
pools
where
water
plants
grew
and
slow
carp
had
dreamed
centuries
away
the
gardens
caused
emily
to
disbelieve
in
the
existence
of
mortimer
street
but
the
house
at
times
caused
her
to
disbelieve
in
herself
the
picture
gallery
especially
had
this
effect
upon
her
the
men
and
women
once
as
alive
as
her
everyday
self
now
gazing
down
at
her
from
their
picture
frames
sometimes
made
her
heart
beat
as
if
she
stood
in
the
presence
of
things
eerie
their
strange
rich
ugly
or
beautiful
garments
their
stolid
or
fervid
ugly
or
beautiful
faces
seemed
to
demand
something
of
her
at
least
she
had
just
enough
imagination
to
feel
somewhat
as
if
they
did
walderhurst
was
very
kind
to
her
but
she
was
afraid
she
might
bore
him
by
the
exceeding
ignorance
of
her
questions
about
people
whom
he
had
known
from
his
childhood
as
his
own
kith
and
kin
it
was
not
unlikely
that
one
might
have
become
so
familiar
with
a
man
in
armour
or
a
woman
in
a
farthingale
that
questions
connected
with
them
might
seem
silly
persons
whose
ancestors
had
always
gazed
intimately
at
them
from
walls
might
not
unnaturally
forget
that
there
were
other
people
to
whom
they
might
wear
only
the
aspect
of
numbers
in
catalogues
of
the
academy
or
exhibitions
of
that
order
there
was
a
very
interesting
catalogue
of
the
palstrey
pictures
and
emily
found
and
studied
it
with
deep
interest
she
cherished
a
touching
secret
desire
to
know
what
might
be
discoverable
concerning
the
women
who
had
been
marchionesses
of
walderhurst
before
none
of
them
but
herself
she
gathered
had
come
to
their
husbands
from
rooms
in
obscure
streets
there
had
been
noble
hyrsts
in
the
reign
of
henry
and
the
period
since
then
elapsed
had
afforded
time
for
numerous
bridals
lady
walderhurst
was
overcome
at
moments
by
her
reflections
upon
what
lay
behind
and
before
her
but
not
being
a
complex
person
or
of
fervid
imagination
she
was
spared
by
nature
the
fevers
of
complex
emotions
in
fact
after
a
few
weeks
had
passed
she
came
out
of
her
dream
and
found
her
happiness
enduring
and
endurable
each
day
awakening
was
a
delight
to
her
and
would
probably
be
so
to
the
end
of
her
existence
absolutely
because
she
was
so
sane
and
uncomplex
a
creature
to
be
deftly
assisted
in
her
dressing
by
jane
cupp
and
to
know
that
each
morning
she
might
be
fittingly
and
becomingly
attired
without
anxiety
as
to
where
her
next
gown
was
to
come
from
was
a
lovely
thing
to
enjoy
the
silent
perfect
workings
of
the
great
household
to
drive
herself
or
be
driven
to
walk
and
read
to
loiter
through
walled
gardens
and
hothouses
at
will
such
things
to
a
healthy
woman
with
an
unobscured
power
of
enjoyment
were
luxuries
which
could
not
pall
walderhurst
found
her
an
actual
addition
to
his
comfort
she
was
never
in
the
way
she
seemed
to
have
discovered
the
trick
of
coming
and
going
undisturbingly
she
was
docile
and
affectionate
but
not
in
the
least
sentimental
he
had
known
men
whose
first
years
of
marriage
not
to
speak
of
the
first
months
had
been
rendered
unbearable
by
the
fact
that
their
wives
were
constantly
demanding
or
expecting
the
expression
of
sentiments
which
unsentimental
males
had
not
at
their
fingers
ends
so
the
men
had
been
annoyed
or
bored
and
the
women
had
been
dissatisfied
emily
demanded
nothing
of
the
sort
and
was
certainly
not
dissatisfied
she
looked
very
handsome
and
happy
her
looks
positively
improved
and
when
people
began
to
call
and
she
to
pay
visits
she
was
very
much
liked
he
had
certainly
been
quite
right
in
deciding
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
if
she
had
a
son
he
should
congratulate
himself
greatly
the
more
he
saw
of
osborn
the
more
he
disliked
him
it
appeared
that
there
was
a
prospect
of
a
child
there
this
last
was
indeed
true
and
emily
had
been
much
touched
and
awakened
to
sympathy
it
had
gradually
become
revealed
to
her
that
the
osborns
were
poorer
than
they
could
decently
admit
emily
had
discovered
that
they
could
not
even
remain
in
the
lodgings
in
duke
street
though
she
did
not
know
the
reason
which
was
that
captain
osborn
had
been
obliged
to
pay
certain
moneys
to
stave
off
a
scandal
not
entirely
unconnected
with
the
young
woman
his
arm
had
encircled
the
day
walderhurst
had
seen
him
on
the
top
of
the
bus
he
was
very
well
aware
that
if
he
was
to
obtain
anything
from
lord
walderhurst
there
were
several
things
which
must
be
kept
entirely
dark
even
a
scandal
belonging
to
the
past
could
be
made
as
unpleasant
as
an
error
of
also
the
young
woman
of
the
bead
cape
knew
how
to
manage
him
but
they
must
remove
to
cheaper
lodgings
and
the
rooms
in
duke
street
had
been
far
from
desirable
lady
walderhurst
came
in
one
morning
from
a
walk
with
a
fresh
colour
and
bright
eyes
and
before
taking
off
her
hat
went
to
her
study
may
i
come
in
walderhurst
had
been
writing
some
uninteresting
letters
and
looked
up
with
a
smile
certainly
he
answered
what
a
colour
you
have
exercise
agrees
with
you
you
ought
to
ride
that
was
what
captain
osborn
said
if
you
do
mind
i
should
like
to
ask
you
something
i
do
mind
you
are
a
reasonable
woman
emily
one
safe
with
you
it
is
something
connected
with
the
osborns
indeed
chilling
slightly
i
do
care
about
them
you
know
you
do
dislike
her
do
you
not
exactly
she
the
truth
is
she
is
not
at
all
well
with
a
trifle
of
hesitance
she
ought
to
be
better
taken
care
of
than
she
is
in
lodgings
and
they
are
obliged
to
take
very
cheap
ones
if
he
had
been
a
more
respectable
fellow
his
circumstances
would
have
been
different
rather
stiffly
emily
felt
alarmed
she
had
not
dreamed
of
the
temerity
of
any
remark
suggestive
of
criticism
yes
hastily
of
course
i
am
sure
you
know
best
but
i
thought
perhaps
walderhurst
liked
her
timidity
to
see
a
fine
tall
upstanding
creature
colour
in
that
way
was
not
disagreeable
when
one
realised
that
she
coloured
because
she
feared
she
might
offend
one
what
did
you
think
was
his
lenient
response
her
colour
grew
warmer
but
this
time
from
a
sense
of
relief
because
he
was
evidently
not
as
displeased
as
he
might
have
been
i
took
a
long
walk
this
morning
she
said
i
went
through
the
high
wood
and
came
out
by
the
place
called
the
kennel
farm
i
was
thinking
a
good
deal
of
poor
osborn
because
i
had
heard
from
her
this
morning
and
she
seemed
so
unhappy
i
was
looking
at
her
letter
again
when
i
turned
into
the
lane
leading
to
the
house
then
i
saw
that
no
one
was
living
there
and
i
could
not
help
going
in
to
look
it
is
such
a
delightful
old
building
with
its
queer
windows
and
chimneys
and
the
ivy
which
seems
never
to
have
been
clipped
the
house
is
so
roomy
and
comfortable
i
peeped
in
at
windows
and
saw
big
fireplaces
with
benches
inside
them
it
seems
a
pity
that
such
a
place
should
not
be
lived
in
and
well
i
thought
how
it
would
be
of
you
to
lend
it
to
the
osborns
while
they
are
in
england
it
would
indeed
be
kind
remarked
his
lordship
without
fervour
her
momentary
excitement
led
emily
to
take
the
liberty
of
putting
out
her
hand
to
touch
his
she
always
felt
as
if
connubial
familiarities
were
rather
a
liberty
at
least
she
had
not
so
far
been
able
to
overcome
a
feeling
rather
of
that
order
and
this
was
another
thing
walderhurst
by
no
means
disliked
he
himself
was
not
aware
that
he
was
a
man
with
a
good
deal
of
internal
vanity
which
enjoyed
soothing
food
in
fact
he
had
not
a
sufficiently
large
brain
to
know
very
much
about
himself
or
to
be
able
to
analyse
his
reasons
for
liking
or
disliking
people
or
things
he
thought
he
knew
his
reasons
for
his
likes
and
dislikes
but
he
was
frequently
very
far
away
from
the
clear
impersonal
truth
about
them
only
the
brilliant
logic
and
sensitiveness
of
genius
really
approaches
knowledge
of
itself
and
as
a
result
it
is
usually
extremely
unhappy
walderhurst
was
never
unhappy
he
was
sometimes
dissatisfied
or
annoyed
but
that
was
as
far
as
his
emotions
went
being
pleased
by
the
warm
touch
of
emily
hand
he
patted
her
wrist
and
looked
agreeably
marital
the
place
was
built
originally
for
a
family
huntsman
and
the
pack
was
kept
there
that
is
why
it
is
called
the
kennel
farm
when
the
last
lease
fell
out
it
remained
unlet
because
i
do
care
for
an
ordinary
tenant
it
the
kind
of
house
that
is
becoming
rare
and
the
bumpkin
farmer
and
his
family
do
value
antiquities
if
it
were
furnished
as
it
be
furnished
said
emily
it
would
be
one
get
old
things
in
london
if
one
can
afford
them
i
seen
them
when
i
been
shopping
they
are
not
cheap
but
you
can
get
them
if
you
really
search
would
you
like
to
furnish
it
walderhurst
inquired
the
consciousness
that
he
could
if
he
chose
do
the
utmost
thing
of
its
kind
in
this
way
at
the
moment
assumed
a
certain
proportion
of
interest
to
him
under
the
stimulation
of
the
wonder
and
delight
which
leaped
into
emily
eyes
as
the
possibility
confronted
her
having
been
born
without
imagination
his
wealth
had
not
done
for
him
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
order
would
i
to
do
it
oh
she
exclaimed
why
in
all
my
life
i
have
never
of
being
able
to
do
such
things
that
of
course
was
true
he
reflected
and
the
fact
added
to
his
appreciation
of
the
moment
there
were
of
course
many
people
to
whom
it
would
be
impossible
to
contemplate
the
spending
of
a
sum
of
money
of
any
importance
in
the
indulgence
of
a
wish
founded
on
mere
taste
he
had
not
thought
of
the
thing
particularly
in
detail
before
and
now
that
he
realised
the
significance
of
the
fact
as
a
fact
emily
had
afforded
him
a
new
sensation
you
may
do
it
now
if
you
wish
he
said
i
once
went
over
the
place
with
an
architect
and
he
said
the
whole
thing
could
be
made
comfortable
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
period
wholly
retained
for
about
a
thousand
pounds
it
is
not
really
dilapidated
and
it
is
worth
saving
the
gables
and
chimneys
are
very
fine
i
will
attend
to
that
and
you
can
do
the
rest
in
your
own
way
it
may
take
a
good
deal
of
money
to
buy
the
old
things
gasped
emily
they
are
not
cheap
in
these
days
people
have
found
out
that
they
are
wanted
it
wo
cost
twenty
thousand
pounds
walderhurst
answered
it
is
a
after
all
and
you
are
a
practical
woman
restore
it
you
have
my
permission
emily
put
her
hands
over
her
eyes
this
was
being
the
marchioness
of
walderhurst
and
made
mortimer
street
a
thing
still
more
incredible
when
she
dropped
her
hands
she
laughed
even
a
trifle
hysterically
i
thank
you
she
said
it
is
as
i
said
i
never
quite
believed
there
were
people
who
were
able
to
think
of
doing
such
things
there
are
such
people
he
said
you
are
one
of
them
and
and
she
put
it
to
him
with
a
sudden
recollection
of
the
thing
her
emotions
had
momentarily
swept
away
oh
i
must
not
forget
because
i
am
so
pleased
when
it
is
furnished
oh
the
osborns
well
we
will
let
them
have
it
for
a
few
months
at
any
rate
they
will
be
so
emotionally
you
will
be
doing
them
a
favour
i
am
doing
it
for
you
not
for
them
i
like
to
see
you
pleased
she
went
to
take
off
her
hat
with
moisture
in
her
eyes
being
overpowered
by
his
munificence
when
she
reached
her
room
she
walked
about
a
little
because
she
was
excited
and
then
sat
down
to
think
of
the
relief
her
next
letter
would
carry
to
osborn
suddenly
she
got
up
and
going
to
her
bedside
knelt
down
she
respectfully
poured
forth
devout
thanks
to
the
deity
she
appealed
to
when
she
aided
in
the
intoning
of
the
litany
on
sundays
her
conception
of
this
power
was
of
the
simplest
conventional
nature
she
would
have
been
astonished
and
frightened
if
she
had
been
told
that
she
regarded
the
omnipotent
being
as
possessing
many
of
the
attributes
of
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
this
was
in
fact
true
without
detracting
from
her
reverence
in
either
case
chapter
ten
the
osborns
were
breakfasting
in
their
unpleasant
in
duke
street
when
lady
walderhurst
letter
arrived
the
toast
was
tough
and
smoked
and
the
eggs
were
of
the
variety
labelled
a
shilling
in
the
shops
the
apartment
was
also
redolent
of
kippered
herring
and
captain
osborn
was
scowling
over
the
landlady
weekly
bill
when
hester
opened
the
envelope
stamped
with
a
coronet
each
time
emily
wrote
a
note
and
found
herself
confronting
the
coronet
on
the
paper
she
blushed
a
little
and
felt
that
she
must
presently
awake
from
her
dream
osborn
herself
was
looking
far
from
amiable
she
was
ill
and
nervous
and
irritable
and
had
in
fact
just
been
crying
and
wishing
that
she
was
dead
which
had
given
rise
to
unpleasantness
between
herself
and
her
husband
who
was
not
in
the
mood
to
feel
patient
with
nerves
here
one
from
the
marchioness
she
remarked
slightingly
i
have
had
none
from
the
marquis
sneered
osborn
he
might
have
condescended
a
reply
the
beggar
hester
was
reading
her
letter
as
she
turned
the
first
page
her
expression
changed
as
has
previously
been
suggested
the
epistolary
methods
of
lady
walderhurst
were
neither
brilliant
nor
literary
and
yet
osborn
seemed
to
be
pleased
by
what
she
read
during
the
reading
of
a
line
or
so
she
wore
an
expression
of
slowly
questioning
wonder
which
a
little
later
on
settled
into
relief
i
can
only
say
i
think
it
very
decent
of
them
she
ejaculated
at
last
really
decent
alec
osborn
looked
up
still
scowlingly
i
do
see
any
cheque
he
observed
that
would
be
the
most
decent
thing
it
the
thing
we
want
most
with
this
damned
woman
sending
in
bills
like
this
for
the
things
we
live
on
and
for
her
confounded
rooms
this
is
better
than
cheques
it
means
our
having
something
we
hope
for
cheques
enough
to
pay
for
they
are
offering
to
lend
us
a
beautiful
old
place
to
live
in
for
the
rest
of
our
stay
what
osborn
exclaimed
where
near
palstrey
manor
where
they
are
staying
now
near
palstrey
how
near
he
had
been
slouching
in
his
chair
and
now
sat
up
and
leaned
forward
on
the
table
he
was
eager
hester
referred
to
the
letter
again
she
does
say
it
is
a
sort
of
antiquity
i
gather
it
called
the
kennel
farm
have
you
ever
been
to
palstrey
not
as
a
guest
he
was
generally
somewhat
sardonic
when
he
spoke
of
anything
connected
with
walderhurst
but
once
i
was
in
the
nearest
county
town
by
chance
and
rode
over
by
jove
starting
a
little
i
wonder
if
it
can
be
a
rum
old
place
i
passed
and
reined
in
to
have
a
look
at
i
hope
it
is
why
it
near
enough
to
the
manor
to
be
convenient
do
you
think
hesitating
that
we
shall
see
much
of
them
we
shall
if
we
manage
things
decently
she
likes
you
and
she
the
kind
of
woman
to
be
sympathising
and
make
a
fuss
over
another
woman
particularly
one
who
is
under
the
weather
and
can
be
sentimentalised
over
hester
was
pushing
crumbs
about
on
the
tablecloth
with
her
knife
and
a
dull
red
showed
itself
on
her
cheek
i
am
not
going
to
make
capital
of
circumstances
she
said
sullenly
i
wo
she
was
not
a
woman
easily
managed
and
osborn
had
had
reason
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
realise
a
certain
wicked
stubbornness
in
her
there
was
a
look
in
her
eye
now
which
frightened
him
it
was
desperately
necessary
that
she
should
be
kept
in
a
tractable
mood
as
she
was
a
girl
with
affections
and
he
was
a
man
without
any
he
knew
what
to
do
he
got
up
and
went
to
her
side
putting
his
arm
round
her
shoulders
as
he
sat
in
a
chair
near
her
now
little
woman
he
said
now
for
god
sake
do
take
it
that
way
do
think
i
do
understand
how
you
feel
i
do
believe
you
know
anything
about
the
way
i
feel
she
said
setting
her
narrow
white
teeth
and
looking
more
like
a
native
woman
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
a
thing
which
did
not
aid
his
affection
for
her
such
as
it
was
happened
to
be
that
in
certain
moods
she
suggested
a
hindoo
beauty
to
him
in
a
way
which
brought
back
to
him
memories
of
the
past
he
did
not
care
to
have
awakened
yes
i
do
yes
i
do
he
protested
getting
hold
of
her
hand
and
trying
to
make
her
look
at
him
there
are
things
such
a
woman
as
you
help
feeling
it
because
you
feel
them
that
you
must
be
on
your
mettle
lord
knows
you
got
pluck
enough
and
stand
by
a
fellow
now
what
shall
i
do
my
god
if
you
do
he
was
in
fact
in
such
straits
that
the
ring
of
emotion
in
his
voice
was
not
by
any
means
assumed
my
god
he
repeated
what
shall
we
all
do
if
you
wo
she
lifted
her
eyes
then
to
look
at
him
she
was
in
a
sufficiently
nervous
condition
to
be
conscious
that
tears
were
always
near
are
there
worse
things
than
you
have
told
me
she
faltered
yes
worse
things
than
it
would
be
fair
to
bother
you
with
i
want
you
to
be
tormented
i
was
a
deuced
fool
before
i
met
you
and
began
to
run
straight
things
pile
in
now
that
would
have
lain
quiet
enough
if
walderhurst
had
not
married
hang
it
all
he
ought
to
do
the
decent
thing
by
me
he
owes
something
to
the
man
who
may
stand
in
his
shoes
after
all
hester
lifted
her
slow
eyes
again
you
not
much
of
a
chance
now
she
said
she
a
fine
healthy
woman
osborn
sprang
up
and
paced
the
floor
set
upon
by
a
sudden
spasm
of
impotent
rage
he
snapped
his
teeth
rather
like
a
dog
oh
curse
her
he
gave
forth
the
great
lumping
brute
what
did
she
come
into
it
for
of
all
the
devilish
things
that
can
happen
to
a
man
the
worst
is
to
be
born
to
the
thing
i
was
born
to
to
know
through
your
whole
life
that
you
just
a
from
rank
and
wealth
and
splendour
and
to
have
to
live
and
look
on
as
an
outsider
upon
my
word
i
felt
more
of
an
outsider
just
because
of
it
there
a
dream
i
had
every
month
or
so
for
years
it
a
dream
of
opening
a
letter
that
tells
me
he
dead
or
of
a
man
coming
into
the
room
or
meeting
me
in
the
street
and
saying
suddenly
died
last
night
walderhurst
died
last
night
they
always
the
same
words
died
last
night
and
i
wake
up
shaking
and
in
a
cold
sweat
for
joy
at
the
gorgeous
luck
that
come
at
last
hester
gave
a
low
cry
like
a
little
howl
and
dropped
her
head
on
her
arms
on
the
table
among
the
cups
and
saucers
she
have
a
son
she
have
a
son
she
cried
and
then
it
matter
whether
dies
or
not
ough
was
the
sound
wrenched
from
osborn
fury
and
our
son
might
have
been
in
it
ours
might
have
had
it
all
damn
damn
he
wo
he
wo
now
even
if
he
lives
to
be
born
she
sobbed
and
clutched
at
the
dingy
tablecloth
with
her
lean
little
hands
it
was
hard
on
her
she
had
had
a
thousand
feverish
dreams
he
had
never
heard
of
she
had
lain
awake
hours
at
night
and
stared
with
eyes
at
the
darkness
picturing
to
her
inner
soul
the
dream
of
splendour
that
she
would
be
part
of
the
solace
for
past
miseries
the
high
revenges
for
past
slights
that
would
be
hers
after
the
hour
in
which
she
heard
the
words
osborn
had
just
quoted
walderhurst
died
last
night
oh
if
luck
had
only
helped
them
if
the
spells
her
ayah
had
taught
her
in
secret
had
only
worked
as
they
would
have
worked
if
she
had
been
a
native
woman
and
had
really
used
them
properly
there
was
a
spell
she
had
wrought
once
which
ameerah
had
sworn
to
her
was
to
be
relied
on
it
took
ten
weeks
to
accomplish
its
end
in
secret
she
had
known
of
a
man
on
whom
it
had
been
worked
she
had
found
out
about
it
partly
from
the
remote
hints
which
had
aided
her
half
knowledge
of
strange
things
and
by
keeping
a
close
watch
the
man
had
died
he
had
died
she
herself
and
with
her
own
eyes
had
seen
him
begin
to
ail
had
heard
of
his
fevers
and
pains
and
final
death
he
had
died
she
knew
that
and
she
had
tried
the
thing
herself
in
dead
secrecy
and
at
the
fifth
week
just
as
with
the
native
who
had
died
she
heard
that
walderhurst
was
during
the
next
four
weeks
she
was
sick
with
the
tension
of
combined
horror
and
delight
but
he
did
not
die
in
the
tenth
week
they
heard
that
he
had
gone
to
tangiers
with
a
party
of
notable
people
and
that
his
slight
indisposition
had
passed
leaving
him
in
admirable
health
and
spirits
her
husband
had
known
nothing
of
her
frenzy
she
would
not
have
dared
to
tell
him
there
were
many
things
she
did
not
tell
him
he
used
to
laugh
at
her
native
stories
of
occult
powers
though
she
knew
that
he
had
seen
some
strange
things
done
as
most
foreigners
had
he
always
explained
such
things
contemptuously
on
grounds
which
presupposed
in
the
performers
of
the
mysteries
powers
of
agility
dexterity
and
universal
knowledge
quite
as
marvellous
as
anything
occult
could
have
been
he
did
not
like
her
to
show
belief
in
the
tricks
of
the
natives
as
he
called
them
it
made
a
woman
look
a
fool
he
said
to
be
so
credulous
during
the
last
few
months
a
new
fever
had
tormented
her
feelings
had
awakened
in
her
which
were
new
she
thought
things
she
had
never
thought
before
she
had
never
cared
for
children
or
suspected
herself
of
being
the
maternal
woman
but
nature
worked
in
her
after
her
weird
fashion
she
began
to
care
less
for
some
things
and
more
for
others
she
cared
less
for
osborn
moods
and
was
better
able
to
defy
them
he
began
to
be
afraid
of
her
temper
and
she
began
to
like
at
times
to
defy
his
there
had
been
some
fierce
scenes
between
them
in
which
he
had
found
her
meet
with
a
flare
of
fury
words
she
would
once
have
been
cowed
by
he
had
spoken
one
day
with
the
coarse
slightingness
of
a
selfish
irritable
brute
of
the
domestic
event
which
was
before
them
he
did
not
speak
twice
she
sprang
up
before
him
and
shook
her
clenched
fist
in
his
face
so
near
that
he
started
back
do
say
a
word
she
cried
do
dare
do
dare
i
tell
you
look
out
if
you
do
want
to
be
killed
during
the
outpouring
of
her
frenzy
he
saw
her
in
an
entirely
new
light
and
made
discoveries
she
would
fight
for
her
young
as
a
tigress
fights
for
hers
she
was
nursing
a
passion
of
secret
feeling
of
which
he
had
known
nothing
he
had
not
for
a
moment
suspected
her
of
it
she
had
not
seemed
that
kind
of
girl
she
had
been
of
the
kind
that
cares
for
finery
and
social
importance
and
the
world
favour
not
for
sentiments
on
this
morning
of
the
letter
arrival
he
watched
her
sobbing
and
clutching
the
tablecloth
and
reflected
he
walked
up
and
down
and
pondered
there
were
a
lot
of
things
to
be
thought
over
we
may
as
well
accept
the
invitation
at
once
he
said
grovel
as
much
as
you
choose
the
more
the
better
they
like
it
chapter
eleven
the
osborns
arrived
at
the
kennel
farm
on
a
lovely
rainy
morning
the
green
of
the
fields
and
trees
and
hedges
was
sweetly
drenched
and
the
flowers
held
drops
which
sparkled
when
the
fitful
sun
broke
forth
and
searched
for
the
hidden
light
in
them
a
palstrey
carriage
comfortably
met
them
and
took
them
to
their
destination
as
they
turned
into
the
lane
osborn
looked
out
at
the
red
gables
and
chimneys
showing
themselves
among
the
trees
it
the
old
place
i
looked
at
he
said
and
a
jolly
old
place
it
is
hester
was
drinking
in
the
pure
sweetness
of
the
fresh
air
and
filling
her
soul
with
the
beauty
of
such
things
as
she
had
never
seen
before
in
london
she
had
grown
hopeless
and
sick
of
spirit
the
lodgings
in
duke
street
the
perpetual
morning
haddock
and
questionable
eggs
and
unpaid
bills
had
been
evil
things
for
her
she
had
reached
a
point
at
which
she
had
felt
she
could
bear
them
no
longer
here
at
all
events
there
would
be
green
trees
and
clear
air
and
no
landlady
with
no
rent
to
pay
there
would
be
freedom
from
one
torment
at
least
she
had
not
expected
much
more
than
this
freedom
however
it
had
seemed
highly
probable
that
there
might
be
discomforts
in
an
ancient
farmhouse
of
the
kind
likely
to
be
lent
to
impecunious
relatives
but
before
they
crossed
the
threshold
it
was
plain
to
her
that
for
some
reason
they
had
been
given
more
the
old
garden
had
been
put
in
order
a
picturesque
and
sweet
disorderly
order
which
had
allowed
creepers
to
luxuriate
and
toss
and
flowers
to
spring
out
of
crannies
and
clumps
of
things
to
mass
themselves
without
restraint
the
girl
wretched
heart
lifted
itself
as
they
drove
up
to
the
venerable
brick
porch
which
had
somewhat
the
air
of
a
little
church
vestibule
through
the
opened
door
she
saw
a
quaint
comfort
she
had
not
dreamed
of
she
had
not
the
knowledge
of
things
which
would
have
told
her
what
wonders
emily
had
done
with
the
place
but
she
could
see
that
its
quaint
furnishings
were
oddly
beautiful
in
their
harmony
the
heavy
chairs
and
benches
and
settles
seemed
to
have
been
part
of
centuries
of
life
and
to
belong
to
the
place
as
much
as
the
massive
beams
and
doors
hester
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
looked
about
her
part
of
it
was
oak
panelled
and
part
was
whitewashed
there
were
deep
low
windows
cut
in
the
thick
walls
i
never
saw
anything
the
least
like
it
she
said
you
would
expect
to
see
anything
like
it
in
india
her
husband
answered
and
you
wo
find
many
places
like
it
in
england
i
should
like
a
look
at
the
stables
he
went
out
almost
immediately
and
took
the
look
in
question
finding
the
result
unexpectedly
satisfactory
walderhurst
had
lent
him
a
decent
horse
to
ride
and
there
was
a
respectable
little
cart
for
hester
palstrey
manor
had
done
them
very
well
this
was
a
good
deal
more
than
he
had
expected
he
knew
such
hospitality
would
not
have
been
shown
him
if
he
had
come
to
england
unmarried
consequently
his
good
luck
was
partly
a
result
of
hester
existence
in
his
life
at
the
same
time
there
awakened
in
him
a
consciousness
that
hester
would
not
have
been
likely
to
produce
such
results
unless
in
combination
with
another
element
in
the
situation
the
element
of
another
woman
who
was
sympathetic
and
had
some
power
the
new
lady
walderhurst
in
fact
and
yet
confound
her
confound
her
he
thought
as
he
walked
into
the
loose
box
to
look
the
mare
over
and
pat
her
sleekness
the
relations
which
established
themselves
between
palstrey
and
the
kennel
farm
were
marked
by
two
characteristic
features
one
of
these
was
that
lord
walderhurst
did
not
develop
any
warmer
interest
in
the
osborns
and
that
lady
walderhurst
did
having
acceded
to
wishes
and
really
behaved
generously
in
the
matter
of
providing
for
his
heir
presumptive
and
his
wife
lord
walderhurst
felt
impelled
to
no
further
demonstration
of
feeling
i
do
like
him
any
better
than
i
did
he
remarked
to
emily
and
i
can
not
say
that
osborn
attracts
me
of
course
there
is
a
reason
why
a
woman
like
yourself
should
be
specially
good
to
her
just
now
do
anything
you
wish
for
them
while
they
are
in
the
neighbourhood
but
as
for
me
the
fact
that
a
man
is
one
heir
presumptive
is
not
enough
in
itself
alone
to
endear
him
to
one
rather
the
contrary
between
these
two
it
is
to
be
confessed
there
existed
that
rancour
which
is
not
weakened
by
the
fact
that
it
remains
unexpressed
and
lurks
in
the
deeps
of
the
inward
being
walderhurst
would
not
have
been
capable
of
explaining
to
himself
that
the
thing
he
chiefly
disliked
in
this
robust
young
man
was
that
when
he
met
him
striding
about
with
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
a
keeper
behind
him
the
almost
unconscious
realisation
of
the
unpleasant
truth
that
he
was
striding
over
what
might
prove
to
be
his
own
acres
and
shooting
birds
which
in
the
future
he
would
himself
possess
the
right
to
preserve
to
invite
other
people
to
shoot
to
keep
less
favoured
persons
from
shooting
as
lord
of
the
manor
this
was
a
truth
sufficiently
irritating
to
accentuate
all
his
faults
of
character
and
breeding
emily
whose
understanding
of
his
nature
developed
with
every
day
of
her
life
grew
into
a
comprehension
of
this
by
degrees
perhaps
her
greatest
leap
forward
was
taken
on
the
day
when
as
he
was
driving
her
in
the
cart
which
had
picked
her
up
on
the
moor
they
saw
osborn
tramping
through
a
cover
with
his
gun
he
did
not
see
them
and
a
shade
of
irritation
swept
walderhurst
face
he
seems
to
feel
very
much
at
home
he
commented
then
he
was
silent
for
a
space
during
which
he
did
not
look
pleased
if
he
were
my
son
he
said
it
would
be
a
different
matter
if
audrey
child
had
lived
he
stopped
and
gave
the
tall
mare
a
light
cut
with
his
whip
he
was
evidently
annoyed
with
himself
for
having
spoken
a
hot
wave
of
colour
submerged
emily
she
felt
it
rush
over
her
whole
body
she
turned
her
face
away
hoping
walderhurst
would
not
observe
her
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
heard
him
utter
his
dead
name
she
had
never
heard
anyone
speak
it
audrey
had
evidently
not
been
a
or
regretted
person
but
she
had
had
a
son
her
primitive
soul
had
scarcely
dared
to
approach
even
with
awe
the
thought
of
such
a
possibility
for
herself
as
in
the
past
she
had
not
had
the
temerity
to
dream
of
herself
as
a
woman
who
possessed
attractions
likely
to
lead
to
marriage
so
she
was
mentally
restrained
in
these
days
there
was
something
in
the
tenor
of
her
thoughts
but
she
would
have
laid
down
her
life
for
this
dull
happiness
and
of
late
she
had
more
than
once
blamed
herself
for
accepting
so
much
unthinkingly
i
did
not
realise
things
properly
she
had
said
to
herself
in
humble
pain
i
ought
to
have
been
a
girl
young
and
strong
and
beautiful
his
sacrifice
was
too
great
it
was
immense
it
had
been
nothing
of
the
sort
he
had
pleased
himself
and
done
what
was
likely
to
tend
and
had
tended
altogether
to
his
own
ease
and
comfort
in
any
case
emily
was
a
fine
creature
and
only
and
with
alec
osborn
at
the
other
side
of
the
globe
the
question
of
leaving
an
heir
had
been
less
present
and
consequently
had
dwindled
in
importance
the
nearness
of
the
osborns
fretted
him
just
now
if
their
child
was
a
son
he
would
be
more
fretted
still
he
was
rather
glad
of
a
possibility
just
looming
of
his
being
called
away
from
england
through
affairs
of
importance
he
had
spoken
to
emily
of
this
possibility
and
she
had
understood
that
as
his
movements
and
the
length
of
his
stay
would
be
uncertain
she
would
not
accompany
him
there
is
one
drawback
to
our
marriage
he
said
is
it
is
it
anything
i
can
remove
emily
asked
no
though
you
are
responsible
for
it
people
seldom
can
remove
the
drawbacks
they
are
responsible
for
you
have
taught
me
to
miss
you
have
i
have
i
cried
emily
oh
i
happy
she
was
so
happy
that
she
felt
that
she
must
pass
on
some
of
her
good
fortune
to
those
who
had
less
she
was
beautifully
kind
to
hester
osborn
few
days
passed
without
the
stopping
of
a
walderhurst
carriage
before
the
door
of
the
kennel
farm
sometimes
emily
came
herself
to
take
osborn
to
drive
sometimes
she
sent
for
her
to
come
to
lunch
and
spend
the
day
or
night
at
palstrey
she
felt
an
interest
in
the
young
woman
which
became
an
affection
she
would
have
felt
interested
in
her
if
there
had
not
existed
a
special
reason
to
call
forth
sympathy
hester
had
many
curious
and
new
subjects
for
conversation
emily
liked
her
descriptions
of
indian
life
and
her
weird
little
stories
of
the
natives
she
was
charmed
with
ameerah
whose
nose
rings
and
native
dress
combining
themselves
with
her
dark
mystic
face
rare
speech
and
gliding
silent
movements
awakened
awe
in
the
rustics
and
mingled
distrust
and
respect
in
the
servants
hall
at
palstrey
she
most
respectably
behaved
my
lady
though
foreign
and
strange
in
her
manners
was
jane
cupp
comment
but
she
has
a
way
of
looking
at
a
person
almost
stealthy
that
upset
me
many
a
time
when
i
noticed
it
suddenly
they
say
that
she
knows
things
like
and
spells
and
love
potions
but
she
will
only
speak
of
them
quite
secret
emily
gathered
that
jane
cupp
was
afraid
of
the
woman
and
kept
a
cautious
eye
upon
her
she
is
a
very
faithful
servant
jane
she
answered
she
is
devoted
to
mrs
osborn
i
am
sure
she
is
my
lady
i
read
in
books
about
the
faithfulness
of
black
people
they
say
they
more
faithful
than
white
ones
not
more
faithful
than
white
ones
said
lady
walderhurst
with
her
good
smile
ameerah
is
not
more
faithful
than
you
i
very
sure
oh
my
lady
ejaculated
jane
turning
red
with
pleasure
i
do
hope
not
i
should
like
to
think
she
could
be
in
fact
the
tropic
suggestion
of
the
ayah
personality
had
warmed
the
imagination
of
the
servants
hall
and
there
had
been
much
talk
of
many
things
of
the
osborns
as
well
as
of
their
servants
and
thrilling
stories
of
east
indian
life
had
been
related
by
walderhurst
man
who
was
a
travelled
person
captain
osborn
had
good
sport
on
these
days
and
sport
was
the
thing
he
best
loved
he
was
of
the
breed
of
man
who
can
fish
hunt
or
shoot
all
day
eat
robust
meals
and
sleep
heavily
all
night
who
can
do
this
every
day
of
a
year
and
in
so
doing
reach
his
highest
point
of
desire
in
existence
he
knew
no
other
aspirations
in
life
than
such
as
the
fortunes
of
a
man
like
walderhurst
could
put
him
in
possession
of
nature
herself
had
built
him
after
the
model
of
the
primeval
type
of
english
country
india
with
her
blasting
and
stifling
hot
seasons
and
her
steaming
rains
gave
him
nothing
that
he
desired
and
filled
him
with
revolt
against
fate
every
hour
of
his
life
his
sanguine
body
loathed
and
grew
restive
under
heat
at
the
kennel
farm
when
he
sprang
out
of
his
bed
in
the
fresh
sweetness
of
the
morning
and
plunged
into
his
tub
he
drew
every
breath
with
a
physical
rapture
the
air
which
swept
in
through
the
casements
was
a
joy
good
lord
he
would
cry
out
to
hester
through
her
door
what
mornings
how
a
man
and
feels
the
blood
rushing
through
his
veins
rain
or
shine
it
all
the
same
to
me
i
ca
stay
indoors
just
to
tramp
through
wet
or
dry
heather
or
under
dripping
or
shining
trees
is
enough
how
can
one
believe
one
has
ever
lain
sweating
with
one
tongue
lolling
out
and
listened
to
the
whining
creak
of
the
punkah
through
nights
too
deadly
hot
to
sleep
in
it
like
remembering
hell
while
one
lives
in
paradise
we
sha
live
in
paradise
long
hester
said
once
with
some
bitterness
hell
is
waiting
for
us
damn
it
do
remind
a
man
there
are
times
when
i
do
believe
it
he
almost
snarled
the
answer
it
was
true
that
his
habit
was
to
enhance
the
pleasure
of
his
days
by
thrusting
into
the
background
all
recollections
of
the
reality
of
any
other
existence
than
that
of
the
hour
as
he
tramped
through
fern
and
heather
he
would
remember
nothing
but
that
there
was
a
chance
there
was
chance
good
lord
after
a
man
not
over
strong
reached
or
five
there
were
more
chances
than
there
had
been
earlier
after
hours
spent
in
such
moods
it
was
not
pleasant
to
come
by
accident
upon
walderhurst
riding
his
fine
chestnut
erect
and
staid
and
be
saluted
by
the
grave
raising
of
his
whip
to
his
hat
or
to
return
to
the
farm
just
as
the
palstrey
barouche
turned
in
at
the
gate
with
lady
walderhurst
sitting
in
it
glowing
with
health
and
that
enjoyable
interest
in
all
things
which
gave
her
a
kind
of
radiance
of
eye
and
colour
she
came
at
length
in
a
time
when
she
did
not
look
quite
so
radiant
this
it
appeared
was
from
a
reason
which
might
be
regarded
as
natural
under
the
circumstances
a
more
ardent
man
than
lord
walderhurst
might
have
felt
that
he
could
not
undertake
a
journey
to
foreign
lands
which
would
separate
him
from
a
wife
comparatively
new
but
lord
walderhurst
was
not
ardent
and
he
had
married
a
woman
who
felt
that
he
did
all
things
well
that
in
fact
a
thing
must
be
well
because
it
was
his
choice
to
do
it
his
journey
to
india
might
it
was
true
be
a
matter
of
a
few
months
and
involved
diplomatic
business
for
which
a
certain
unimpeachable
respectability
was
required
a
more
brilliant
man
who
had
been
less
respectable
in
the
most
decorous
british
sense
would
not
have
served
the
purpose
of
the
government
emily
skin
had
lost
a
shade
of
its
healthful
freshness
it
struck
hester
when
she
saw
her
there
was
a
suggestion
of
fulness
under
her
eyes
yet
with
the
bright
patience
of
her
smile
she
defied
the
remote
suspicion
that
she
had
shed
a
tear
or
so
before
leaving
home
she
explained
the
situation
with
an
affectionally
reverent
dwelling
upon
the
dignity
of
the
mission
which
would
temporarily
bereave
her
of
her
mate
her
belief
in
walderhurst
intellectual
importance
to
the
welfare
of
the
government
was
a
complete
and
touching
thing
it
will
not
be
for
very
long
she
said
and
you
and
i
must
see
a
great
deal
of
each
other
i
am
so
glad
you
are
here
you
know
how
one
misses
breaking
off
with
an
admirable
air
of
determined
cheer
i
must
not
think
of
that
walderhurst
congratulated
himself
seriously
during
the
days
before
his
departure
she
was
so
exactly
what
he
liked
a
woman
to
be
she
might
have
made
difficulties
or
have
been
sentimental
if
she
had
been
a
girl
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
set
up
a
sort
of
nursery
for
her
but
this
fine
amenable
sensible
creature
could
take
perfect
care
of
herself
it
was
only
necessary
to
express
a
wish
and
she
not
only
knew
how
to
carry
it
out
but
was
ready
to
do
so
without
question
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
was
willing
to
leave
all
to
her
own
taste
it
was
such
decent
taste
she
had
no
modern
ideas
which
might
lead
during
his
absence
to
any
action
likely
to
disturb
or
annoy
him
what
she
would
like
best
to
do
would
be
to
stay
at
palstrey
and
enjoy
the
beauty
of
it
she
would
spend
her
days
in
strolling
through
the
gardens
talking
to
the
gardeners
who
had
all
grown
fond
of
her
or
paying
little
visits
to
old
people
or
young
ones
in
the
village
she
would
help
the
vicar
wife
in
her
charities
she
would
appear
in
the
manor
pew
at
church
regularly
make
the
necessary
dull
calls
and
go
to
the
unavoidable
dull
dinners
with
a
faultless
amiability
and
decorum
as
i
remarked
when
you
told
me
you
had
asked
her
to
marry
you
said
lady
maria
on
the
occasion
of
his
lunching
with
her
on
running
up
to
town
for
a
day
business
you
showed
a
great
deal
more
sense
than
most
men
of
your
age
and
rank
if
people
marry
they
should
choose
the
persons
least
likely
to
interfere
with
them
emily
will
never
interfere
with
you
she
cares
a
great
deal
more
about
your
pleasure
than
her
own
and
as
to
that
she
so
much
like
a
big
healthy
good
child
that
she
would
find
pleasure
wheresoever
you
dropped
her
this
was
true
yet
the
healthy
childish
creature
had
in
deep
privacy
cried
a
little
and
was
pathetically
glad
to
feel
that
the
osborns
were
to
be
near
her
and
that
she
would
have
hester
to
think
of
and
take
care
of
during
the
summer
it
was
pathetic
that
she
should
cherish
an
affection
so
ingenuous
for
the
osborns
for
one
of
them
at
least
had
no
patience
with
her
to
captain
osborn
her
existence
and
presence
in
the
near
neighbourhood
were
offences
he
told
himself
that
she
was
of
the
particular
type
of
woman
he
most
disliked
she
was
a
big
blundering
fool
he
said
and
her
size
and
very
good
nature
itself
got
on
his
nerves
and
irritated
him
she
looks
so
deucedly
prosperous
with
her
clothes
and
her
bouncing
health
he
said
the
tread
of
her
big
feet
makes
me
mad
when
i
hear
it
hester
answered
with
a
shrill
little
laugh
her
big
feet
are
a
better
shape
than
mine
she
said
i
ought
to
hate
her
and
i
would
if
i
could
but
i
ca
i
can
muttered
osborn
between
his
teeth
as
he
turned
to
the
mantel
and
scratched
a
match
to
light
his
pipe
chapter
twelve
when
lord
walderhurst
took
his
departure
for
india
his
wife
began
to
order
her
daily
existence
as
he
had
imagined
she
would
before
he
had
left
her
she
had
appeared
at
the
first
and
had
spent
a
few
weeks
at
the
town
house
where
they
had
given
several
imposing
and
serious
dinner
parties
more
remarkable
for
dignity
and
good
taste
than
liveliness
the
duties
of
social
existence
in
town
would
have
been
unbearable
for
emily
without
her
husband
dressed
by
jane
cupp
with
a
passion
of
fervour
fine
folds
sweeping
from
her
small
long
waist
diamonds
strung
round
her
neck
and
a
tiara
or
a
big
star
in
her
full
brown
hair
emily
was
rather
superb
when
supported
by
the
consciousness
that
walderhurst
maturity
and
long
accustomedness
were
near
her
with
him
she
could
enjoy
even
the
unlively
splendour
of
a
function
but
without
him
she
would
have
been
very
unhappy
at
palstrey
she
was
ceasing
to
feel
new
and
had
begun
to
realise
that
she
belonged
to
the
world
she
lived
in
she
was
becoming
accustomed
to
her
surroundings
and
enjoyed
them
to
the
utmost
her
easily
roused
affections
were
warmed
by
the
patriarchal
atmosphere
of
village
life
most
of
the
palstrey
villagers
had
touched
their
forelocks
or
curtsied
to
walderhursts
for
generations
emily
liked
to
remember
this
and
had
at
once
conceived
a
fondness
for
the
simple
folk
who
seemed
somehow
related
so
closely
to
the
man
she
worshipped
walderhurst
had
not
the
faintest
conception
of
what
this
worship
represented
he
did
not
even
reach
the
length
of
realising
its
existence
he
saw
her
ingenuous
reverence
for
and
belief
in
him
and
was
naturally
rather
pleased
by
them
he
was
also
vaguely
aware
that
if
she
had
been
a
more
brilliant
woman
she
would
have
been
a
more
exacting
one
and
less
easily
impressed
if
she
had
been
a
stupid
woman
or
a
clumsy
one
he
would
have
detested
her
and
bitterly
regretted
his
marriage
but
she
was
only
innocent
and
gratefully
admiring
which
qualities
combining
themselves
with
good
looks
good
health
and
good
manners
made
of
a
woman
something
he
liked
immensely
really
she
had
looked
very
nice
and
attractive
when
she
had
bidden
him
with
her
emotional
flush
and
softness
of
expression
and
the
dewy
brightness
of
her
eyes
there
was
something
actually
moving
in
the
way
her
strong
hand
had
wrung
his
at
the
last
moment
i
only
she
had
said
i
only
do
so
that
there
was
something
i
could
for
you
while
you
are
away
something
you
could
leave
me
to
keep
well
and
enjoy
yourself
he
had
answered
that
will
really
please
me
nature
had
not
so
built
him
that
he
could
suspect
that
she
went
home
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
in
his
rooms
putting
away
his
belongings
with
her
own
hands
just
for
the
mere
passion
of
comfort
she
felt
in
touching
the
things
he
had
worn
the
books
he
had
handled
the
cushions
his
head
had
rested
against
she
had
indeed
mentioned
to
the
housekeeper
at
berkeley
square
that
she
wished
his
lordship
apartments
to
remain
untouched
until
she
herself
had
looked
over
them
the
obsession
which
is
called
love
is
an
emotion
past
all
explanation
the
persons
susceptible
to
its
power
are
as
things
beneath
a
spell
they
see
hear
and
feel
that
of
which
the
rest
of
their
world
is
unaware
and
will
remain
unaware
for
ever
to
the
endearing
and
qualities
emily
walderhurst
saw
in
this
more
than
gentleman
an
unstirred
world
would
remain
blind
deaf
and
imperceptive
until
its
end
transpired
this
however
made
not
the
slightest
difference
in
the
reality
of
these
things
as
she
saw
and
felt
and
was
moved
to
her
centre
by
them
bright
youth
in
agatha
norman
at
present
joyously
girdling
the
globe
with
her
bridegroom
was
moved
much
less
deeply
despite
its
laughter
and
love
a
large
lump
swelled
in
emily
throat
as
she
walked
about
the
comfortable
deserted
apartments
of
her
james
large
tears
dropped
on
the
breast
of
her
dress
as
they
had
dropped
upon
her
linen
blouse
when
she
walked
across
the
moor
to
maundell
but
she
bravely
smiled
as
she
tenderly
brushed
away
with
her
hand
two
drops
which
fell
upon
a
tweed
waistcoat
she
had
picked
up
having
done
this
she
suddenly
stooped
and
kissed
the
rough
cloth
fervently
burying
her
face
in
it
with
a
sob
i
do
him
so
she
whispered
hysterically
i
do
so
him
and
i
shall
so
him
with
the
italicised
feelingness
of
old
the
outburst
was
in
fact
so
strongly
italicised
that
she
felt
the
next
moment
almost
as
if
she
had
been
a
little
indecent
she
had
never
been
called
upon
by
the
strenuousness
of
any
occasion
to
mention
baldly
to
lord
walderhurst
that
she
loved
him
it
had
not
been
necessary
and
she
was
too
little
used
to
it
not
to
be
abashed
by
finding
herself
proclaiming
the
fact
to
his
very
waistcoat
itself
she
sat
down
holding
the
garment
in
her
hands
and
let
her
tears
fall
she
looked
about
her
at
the
room
and
across
the
corridor
through
the
open
door
at
his
study
which
adjoined
it
they
were
fine
rooms
and
every
book
and
bust
and
chair
looked
singularly
suggestive
of
his
personality
the
whole
house
was
beautiful
and
imposing
in
emily
eyes
he
has
made
all
my
life
beautiful
and
full
of
comfort
and
happiness
she
said
trembling
he
has
saved
me
from
everything
i
was
afraid
of
and
there
is
nothing
i
can
oh
suddenly
dropping
a
hot
face
on
her
hands
if
i
were
only
hester
osborn
i
should
be
glad
to
suffer
anything
or
die
in
any
way
i
should
have
paid
him
back
just
a
little
if
i
might
for
there
was
one
thing
she
had
learned
through
her
yearning
fervour
not
through
any
speech
of
his
all
the
desire
and
pride
in
him
would
be
fed
full
and
satisfied
if
he
could
pass
his
name
on
to
a
creature
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
all
the
heat
his
cold
nature
held
had
concentrated
itself
in
a
secret
passion
centred
on
this
thing
she
had
begun
to
awaken
to
a
suspicion
of
this
early
in
their
marriage
and
afterwards
by
processes
of
inclusion
and
exclusion
she
had
realised
the
proud
intensity
of
his
feeling
despite
his
reserve
and
silence
as
for
her
she
would
have
gone
to
the
stake
or
have
allowed
her
flesh
to
be
cut
into
pieces
to
form
that
which
would
have
given
him
reason
for
exultation
and
pride
such
was
the
helpless
tragic
kindly
love
and
yearning
of
her
the
thing
filled
her
with
a
passion
of
tenderness
for
hester
osborn
she
yearned
over
her
too
her
spinster
life
had
never
brought
her
near
to
the
mystery
of
birth
she
was
very
ignorant
and
deeply
awed
by
the
mere
thought
of
it
at
the
outset
hester
had
been
coldly
shy
and
reticent
but
as
they
saw
each
other
more
she
began
to
melt
before
the
unselfish
warmth
of
the
other
woman
overtures
of
friendship
she
was
very
lonely
and
totally
inexperienced
as
agatha
slade
had
gradually
fallen
into
intimacy
of
speech
so
did
she
she
longed
so
desperately
for
companionship
that
the
very
intensity
of
her
feelings
impelled
her
to
greater
openness
than
she
had
at
first
intended
i
suppose
men
do
know
she
said
to
herself
sullenly
in
thinking
of
osborn
who
spent
his
days
out
of
doors
at
any
rate
they
do
care
emily
cared
greatly
and
was
so
full
of
interest
and
sympathy
that
there
was
something
like
physical
relief
in
talking
to
her
you
two
have
become
great
pals
alec
said
on
an
afternoon
when
he
stood
at
a
window
watching
lady
walderhurst
carriage
drive
away
you
spend
hours
together
talking
what
is
it
all
about
she
talks
a
good
deal
about
her
husband
it
is
a
comfort
to
her
to
find
someone
to
listen
she
thinks
he
is
a
god
but
we
principally
talk
about
me
do
discourage
her
laughed
osborn
perhaps
she
will
get
so
fond
of
you
that
she
will
not
be
willing
to
part
with
us
as
she
will
be
obliged
to
take
both
to
keep
one
i
wish
she
would
i
wish
she
would
sighed
hester
tossing
up
her
hands
in
a
languid
yet
fretted
gesture
the
contrast
between
herself
and
this
woman
was
very
often
too
great
to
be
equably
borne
even
her
kindness
could
not
palliate
it
the
simple
perfection
of
her
country
clothes
the
shining
skins
of
her
horses
the
smooth
roll
of
her
carriage
the
automatic
servants
who
attended
her
were
suggestive
of
that
ease
and
completeness
in
all
things
only
to
be
compassed
by
wealth
to
see
every
day
the
evidences
of
it
while
one
lived
on
charitable
sufferance
on
the
crumbs
which
fell
from
the
master
table
was
a
galling
enough
thing
after
all
it
would
always
have
been
galling
but
it
mattered
so
much
more
now
so
much
more
to
hester
than
she
had
known
it
could
matter
even
in
those
days
when
as
a
girl
she
had
thirstily
longed
for
it
in
those
days
she
had
not
lived
near
enough
to
it
all
to
know
the
full
meaning
and
value
of
it
the
beauty
and
luxury
the
stateliness
and
good
taste
to
have
known
it
in
this
way
to
have
been
almost
part
of
it
and
then
to
leave
it
to
go
back
to
a
existence
in
a
wretched
bungalow
hounded
by
debt
pinched
and
bound
hard
and
fast
by
poverty
which
offered
no
future
prospect
of
bettering
itself
into
decent
good
luck
who
could
bear
it
both
were
thinking
the
same
thing
as
their
eyes
met
how
are
we
to
stand
it
after
this
she
cried
out
sharply
we
ca
stand
it
he
answered
confound
it
all
something
happen
nothing
will
she
said
nothing
but
that
we
shall
go
back
worse
off
than
before
at
this
period
lady
walderhurst
went
to
london
again
to
shop
and
spent
two
entire
happy
days
in
buying
beautiful
things
of
various
kinds
which
were
all
to
be
sent
to
osborn
at
the
kennel
farm
palstrey
she
had
never
enjoyed
herself
so
much
in
her
life
as
she
did
during
those
two
days
when
she
sat
for
hours
at
one
counter
after
another
looking
at
exquisite
linen
and
flannel
and
lace
the
days
she
had
spent
with
lady
maria
in
purchasing
her
trousseau
had
not
compared
with
these
two
she
looked
actually
lovely
as
she
almost
fondled
the
fine
fabrics
smiling
with
warm
softness
at
the
pretty
things
shown
her
she
spent
in
fact
good
deal
of
money
and
luxuriated
in
so
doing
as
she
could
never
have
luxuriated
in
spending
it
in
finery
for
herself
nothing
indeed
seemed
too
in
its
fineness
no
quantity
of
lace
seemed
in
excess
her
heart
positively
trembled
in
her
breast
sometimes
and
she
found
strange
tears
rising
in
her
eyes
they
are
so
sweet
she
said
plaintively
to
the
silence
of
her
own
bedroom
as
she
looked
some
of
her
purchases
over
i
do
know
why
they
give
me
such
a
feeling
they
look
so
little
and
helpless
and
as
if
they
were
made
to
hold
in
one
arms
it
absurd
of
me
i
daresay
the
morning
the
boxes
arrived
at
the
kennel
farm
emily
came
too
she
was
in
the
big
carriage
and
carried
with
her
some
special
final
purchases
she
wanted
to
bring
herself
she
came
because
she
could
not
have
kept
away
she
wanted
to
see
the
things
again
to
be
with
hester
when
she
unpacked
them
to
help
her
to
look
them
all
over
to
touch
them
and
hold
them
in
her
hands
she
found
hester
in
the
large
room
in
which
she
slept
the
big
bed
was
already
snowed
over
with
a
drift
of
whiteness
and
open
boxes
were
scattered
about
there
was
an
odd
expression
in
the
girl
eyes
and
she
had
a
red
spot
on
either
cheek
i
did
not
expect
anything
like
this
she
said
i
thought
i
should
have
to
make
some
plain
little
things
myself
suited
to
its
station
with
a
wry
smile
they
would
have
been
very
ugly
i
do
know
how
to
sew
in
the
least
you
forget
that
you
were
not
buying
things
for
a
prince
or
a
princess
but
for
a
little
beggar
oh
do
cried
emily
taking
both
her
hands
let
us
be
it
was
so
to
buy
them
i
never
liked
anything
so
much
in
my
life
she
went
and
stood
by
the
bedside
taking
up
the
things
one
by
one
touching
up
frills
of
lace
and
smoothing
out
tucks
does
it
make
you
happy
to
look
at
them
she
said
look
at
them
said
hester
staring
at
her
as
if
the
sight
of
them
made
you
hungry
or
as
if
you
had
bought
them
for
yourself
emily
turned
slightly
away
she
said
nothing
for
a
few
moments
there
was
a
dead
silence
hester
spoke
again
what
in
the
world
was
it
in
the
mere
look
of
the
tall
straight
body
of
the
woman
to
make
her
feel
hot
and
angered
if
you
had
bought
them
for
yourself
she
persisted
they
would
be
worn
by
a
marquis
of
walderhurst
emily
laid
down
the
robe
she
had
been
holding
she
put
it
on
the
bed
and
turned
round
to
look
at
hester
osborn
with
serious
eyes
they
be
worn
by
a
marquis
of
walderhurst
you
know
she
answered
they
may
she
was
remotely
hurt
and
startled
because
she
felt
in
the
young
woman
something
she
had
felt
once
or
twice
before
something
resentful
in
her
thoughts
of
herself
as
if
for
the
moment
she
represented
to
her
an
enemy
the
next
moment
however
hester
osborn
fell
upon
her
with
embraces
you
are
an
angel
to
me
she
cried
you
are
an
angel
and
i
thank
you
i
do
know
how
emily
walderhurst
patted
her
shoulder
as
she
kindly
enfolded
her
in
warm
arms
do
thank
me
she
half
whispered
emotionally
do
just
let
us
ourselves
chapter
thirteen
alec
osborn
rode
a
good
deal
in
these
days
he
also
walked
a
good
deal
sometimes
with
a
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
followed
by
a
keeper
sometimes
alone
there
was
scarcely
a
square
yard
of
the
palstrey
manor
lands
he
had
not
tramped
over
he
had
learned
the
whole
estate
by
heart
its
woods
its
farms
its
moorlands
a
morbid
secret
interest
in
its
beauties
and
resources
possessed
him
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
ask
apparently
casual
questions
of
keepers
and
farmers
when
he
found
himself
with
them
he
managed
to
give
his
inquiries
as
much
the
air
of
accident
as
possible
but
he
himself
knew
that
they
were
made
as
a
result
of
a
certain
fevered
curiosity
he
found
that
he
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
continually
making
plans
connected
with
the
place
he
said
to
himself
if
it
were
mine
i
would
do
this
or
that
if
i
owned
it
i
would
make
this
change
or
that
one
i
would
discharge
this
keeper
or
put
another
man
on
such
a
farm
he
tramped
among
the
heather
thinking
these
things
over
and
realising
to
the
full
what
the
pleasure
of
such
powers
would
mean
to
a
man
such
as
himself
a
man
whose
vanity
had
never
been
fed
who
had
a
desire
to
control
and
a
longing
for
active
life
if
it
were
mine
if
it
were
mine
he
would
say
to
himself
oh
damn
it
all
if
it
were
only
mine
and
there
were
other
places
as
fine
and
finer
places
he
had
never
seen
oswyth
hurst
and
towers
all
walderhurst
all
belonging
to
this
one
respectable
elderly
muff
thus
he
summed
up
the
character
of
his
relative
as
for
himself
he
was
young
strong
and
with
veins
swelling
with
the
insistent
longing
for
joyful
exultant
life
the
sweating
panting
drudgery
of
existence
in
india
was
a
thought
of
hell
to
him
but
there
it
was
looming
up
nearer
and
nearer
with
every
heavenly
english
day
that
passed
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
back
go
back
thrust
one
neck
into
the
collar
again
and
sweat
and
be
galled
to
the
end
he
had
no
ambitions
connected
with
his
profession
he
realised
loathingly
in
these
days
that
he
had
always
been
waiting
waiting
the
big
woman
who
was
always
hanging
about
hester
doing
her
favours
he
actually
began
to
watch
feverishly
she
was
such
a
fool
she
always
looked
so
healthy
and
she
was
specially
such
a
fool
over
walderhurst
when
she
had
news
of
him
it
was
to
be
seen
shining
in
her
face
she
had
a
sentimental
fancy
that
during
his
absence
she
would
apply
herself
to
the
task
of
learning
to
ride
she
had
been
intending
to
do
so
before
he
went
away
they
had
indeed
spoken
of
it
together
and
walderhurst
had
given
her
a
handsome
gentle
young
mare
the
creature
was
as
kind
as
she
was
beautiful
osborn
who
was
celebrated
for
his
horsemanship
had
promised
to
undertake
to
give
the
lessons
a
few
days
after
her
return
from
london
with
her
purchases
she
asked
the
husband
and
wife
to
lunch
with
her
at
palstrey
and
during
the
meal
broached
the
subject
i
should
like
to
begin
soon
if
you
can
spare
the
time
for
me
she
said
i
want
to
be
able
to
go
out
with
him
when
he
comes
back
do
you
think
i
shall
be
slow
in
learning
perhaps
i
ought
to
be
lighter
to
ride
well
i
think
you
will
be
pretty
sure
to
have
a
seat
osborn
answered
you
will
be
likely
to
look
particularly
well
do
you
think
i
shall
how
good
you
are
to
encourage
me
how
soon
could
i
begin
she
was
quite
agreeably
excited
in
fact
she
was
delighted
by
innocent
visions
of
herself
as
walderhurst
equestrian
companion
perhaps
if
she
sat
well
and
learned
fine
control
of
her
horse
he
might
be
pleased
and
turn
to
look
at
her
as
they
rode
side
by
side
with
that
look
of
approval
and
dawning
warmth
which
brought
such
secret
joy
to
her
soul
when
may
i
take
my
first
lesson
she
said
quite
eagerly
to
captain
osborn
for
whom
a
footman
was
pouring
out
a
glass
of
wine
as
soon
he
answered
as
i
have
taken
out
the
mare
two
or
three
times
myself
i
want
to
know
her
thoroughly
i
would
not
let
you
mount
her
until
i
had
learned
her
by
heart
they
went
out
to
the
stables
after
lunch
and
visited
the
mare
in
her
loose
box
she
was
a
fine
beast
and
seemed
as
gentle
as
a
child
captain
osborn
asked
questions
of
the
head
groom
concerning
her
she
had
a
perfect
reputation
but
nevertheless
she
was
to
be
taken
over
to
the
kennel
stables
a
few
days
before
lady
walderhurst
mounted
her
it
is
necessary
to
be
more
than
careful
osborn
said
to
hester
that
night
there
would
be
the
devil
and
all
to
pay
if
anything
went
wrong
the
mare
was
brought
over
the
next
morning
she
was
a
shining
bay
and
her
name
was
faustine
in
the
afternoon
captain
osborn
took
her
out
he
rode
her
far
and
learned
her
thoroughly
before
he
brought
her
back
she
was
as
lively
as
a
kitten
but
as
kind
as
a
dove
nothing
could
have
been
better
tempered
and
safer
she
would
pass
anything
even
the
unexpected
appearance
of
a
engine
turning
a
corner
did
not
perceptibly
disturb
her
is
she
well
behaved
hester
asked
at
dinner
time
yes
apparently
was
his
answer
but
i
shall
take
her
out
once
or
twice
again
he
did
take
her
out
again
and
had
only
praise
for
her
on
each
occasion
but
the
riding
lessons
did
not
begin
at
once
in
fact
he
was
for
a
number
of
reasons
in
a
sullen
and
unsociable
humour
which
did
not
incline
him
towards
the
task
he
had
undertaken
he
made
various
excuses
for
not
beginning
the
lessons
and
took
faustine
out
almost
every
day
but
hester
had
an
idea
that
he
did
not
enjoy
his
rides
he
used
to
return
from
them
with
a
resentful
sombre
look
as
if
his
reflections
had
not
been
pleasant
company
for
him
in
truth
they
were
not
pleasant
company
he
was
beset
by
thoughts
he
did
not
exactly
care
to
be
beset
by
thoughts
which
led
him
farther
than
he
really
cared
to
go
which
did
not
incline
him
to
the
close
companionship
of
lady
walderhurst
it
was
these
thoughts
which
led
him
on
his
long
rides
it
was
one
of
them
which
impelled
him
one
morning
as
he
was
passing
a
heap
of
broken
stone
piled
for
the
mending
of
the
ways
by
the
roadside
to
touch
faustine
with
heel
and
whip
the
astonished
young
animal
sprang
aside
curvetting
she
did
not
understand
and
to
the
uncomprehended
is
alarming
she
was
more
bewildered
and
also
more
fretted
when
in
passing
the
next
stone
heap
she
felt
the
same
stinging
touches
what
did
it
mean
was
she
to
avoid
this
thing
to
leap
at
sight
of
it
to
do
what
she
tossed
her
delicate
head
and
snorted
in
her
trouble
the
country
road
was
at
some
distance
from
palstrey
and
was
little
frequented
no
one
was
in
sight
osborn
glanced
about
him
to
make
sure
of
this
fact
a
long
stretch
of
road
lay
before
him
with
stone
heaps
piled
at
regular
intervals
he
had
taken
a
big
whiskey
and
soda
at
the
last
wayside
inn
he
had
passed
and
drink
did
not
make
him
drunk
so
much
as
mad
he
pushed
the
mare
ahead
feeling
in
just
the
humour
to
try
experiments
with
her
alec
is
very
determined
that
you
shall
be
safe
on
faustine
hester
said
to
emily
he
takes
her
out
every
day
it
is
very
good
of
him
answered
emily
hester
thought
she
looked
a
trifle
nervous
and
wondered
why
she
did
not
say
anything
about
the
riding
lessons
and
in
fact
had
seemed
of
late
less
eager
and
interested
in
the
first
place
it
had
been
alec
who
had
postponed
now
it
was
she
first
one
trifling
thing
and
then
another
seemed
to
interpose
the
mare
is
as
safe
as
a
osborn
said
to
her
one
afternoon
when
they
were
taking
tea
on
the
lawn
at
palstrey
you
had
better
begin
now
if
you
wish
to
accomplish
anything
before
lord
walderhurst
comes
back
what
do
you
hear
from
him
as
to
his
return
emily
had
heard
that
he
was
likely
to
be
detained
longer
than
he
had
expected
it
seemed
always
to
be
the
case
that
people
were
detained
by
such
business
he
was
annoyed
but
it
could
not
be
helped
there
was
a
rather
tired
look
in
her
eyes
and
she
was
paler
than
usual
i
am
going
up
to
town
she
said
the
riding
lessons
might
begin
after
i
come
back
are
you
anxious
about
anything
hester
asked
her
as
she
was
preparing
for
the
drive
back
to
the
kennel
farm
no
no
emily
answered
only
only
what
i
should
be
so
glad
if
if
he
were
not
away
hester
gazed
reflectively
at
her
suddenly
quivering
face
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
a
woman
so
fond
of
a
man
she
said
emily
stood
still
she
was
quite
silent
her
eyes
slowly
filled
she
had
never
been
able
to
say
much
about
what
she
felt
for
walderhurst
hers
was
a
large
dumb
primitive
affection
she
sat
at
her
open
bedroom
window
a
long
time
that
evening
she
rested
her
chin
upon
her
hand
and
looked
up
at
the
deeps
of
blue
powdered
with
the
diamond
dust
of
stars
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
never
looked
up
and
seen
such
myriads
of
stars
before
she
felt
far
away
from
earthly
things
and
tremulously
uplifted
during
the
last
two
weeks
she
had
lived
in
a
tumult
of
mind
of
amazement
of
awe
of
hope
and
fear
no
wonder
that
she
looked
pale
and
that
her
face
was
full
of
anxious
yearning
there
were
such
wonders
in
the
world
and
she
emily
no
emily
walderhurst
seemed
to
have
become
part
of
them
she
clasped
her
hands
tight
together
and
leaned
forward
into
the
night
with
her
face
turned
upwards
very
large
drops
began
to
roll
fast
down
her
cheeks
one
after
the
other
the
argument
of
scientific
observation
might
have
said
she
was
hysterical
and
whether
with
or
without
reason
is
immaterial
she
did
not
try
to
check
her
tears
or
wipe
them
away
because
she
did
not
know
that
she
was
crying
she
began
to
pray
and
heard
herself
saying
the
lord
prayer
like
a
child
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
she
murmured
imploringly
she
said
the
prayer
to
the
end
and
then
began
it
over
again
she
said
it
three
or
four
times
and
her
appeal
for
daily
bread
and
the
forgiveness
of
trespasses
expressed
what
her
inarticulate
nature
could
not
have
put
into
words
beneath
the
entire
vault
of
heaven
dark
blue
that
night
there
was
nowhere
lifted
to
the
unknown
a
prayer
more
humbly
and
gratefully
imploring
than
her
final
whisper
for
thine
is
the
kingdom
the
power
and
the
glory
for
ever
and
ever
amen
amen
when
she
left
her
seat
at
the
window
and
turned
towards
the
room
again
jane
cupp
who
was
preparing
for
the
morrow
journey
and
was
just
entering
with
a
dress
over
her
arm
found
herself
restraining
a
start
at
sight
of
her
i
hope
you
are
quite
well
my
lady
she
faltered
yes
lady
walderhurst
answered
i
think
i
am
very
well
very
well
jane
you
will
be
quite
ready
for
the
early
train
morning
yes
my
lady
quite
i
have
been
thinking
said
emily
gently
almost
in
a
tone
of
reverie
that
if
your
uncle
had
not
wanted
your
mother
so
much
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
her
here
with
us
she
is
such
an
experienced
person
and
so
kind
i
never
forget
how
kind
she
was
to
me
when
i
had
the
little
room
in
mortimer
street
oh
my
lady
you
was
kind
to
cried
jane
she
recalled
afterwards
with
tears
how
her
ladyship
moved
nearer
to
her
and
took
her
hand
with
what
jane
called
her
wonderful
look
which
always
brought
a
lump
to
her
throat
but
i
always
count
on
you
jane
she
said
i
count
on
you
so
much
oh
my
lady
jane
cried
again
it
my
comfort
to
believe
it
i
lay
down
my
life
for
your
ladyship
i
would
indeed
emily
sat
down
and
on
her
face
there
was
a
soft
uplifted
smile
yes
she
said
and
jane
cupp
saw
that
she
was
reflective
again
and
the
words
were
not
addressed
exactly
to
herself
one
would
be
quite
ready
to
lay
down
one
life
for
the
person
one
loved
it
seems
even
a
little
thing
does
it
chapter
fourteen
lady
walderhurst
remained
in
town
a
week
and
jane
cupp
remained
with
her
in
the
house
in
berkeley
square
which
threw
open
its
doors
to
receive
them
on
their
arrival
quite
as
if
they
had
never
left
it
the
servants
hall
brightened
temporarily
in
its
hope
that
livelier
doings
might
begin
to
stir
the
establishment
but
jane
cupp
was
able
to
inform
inquirers
that
the
visit
was
only
to
be
a
brief
one
we
are
going
back
to
palstrey
next
monday
she
explained
my
lady
prefers
the
country
and
she
is
very
fond
of
palstrey
and
no
wonder
it
does
seem
at
all
likely
she
come
to
stay
in
london
until
his
lordship
gets
back
we
hear
said
the
head
housemaid
that
her
ladyship
is
very
kind
to
captain
osborn
and
his
wife
and
that
osborn
in
a
delicate
state
of
health
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
us
if
it
was
in
our
family
remarked
an
under
housemaid
who
was
pert
jane
cupp
looked
extremely
reserved
is
it
true
the
pert
housemaid
persisted
that
the
osborns
abide
her
it
true
said
jane
severely
that
she
goodness
itself
to
them
and
they
ought
to
adore
her
we
hear
they
do
put
in
the
tallest
footman
and
who
wonders
if
she
was
an
angel
there
just
a
chance
that
she
may
give
captain
osborn
a
wipe
in
the
eye
though
she
is
in
her
thirties
it
not
for
said
jane
stiffly
to
discuss
thirties
or
forties
or
fifties
either
which
are
no
business
of
ours
there
one
gentleman
and
him
a
marquis
as
chose
her
over
the
heads
of
two
beauties
in
their
teens
at
least
well
for
the
matter
of
that
admitted
the
tall
footman
i
have
chose
her
myself
for
she
a
fine
woman
lady
maria
was
just
on
the
point
of
leaving
south
audley
street
to
make
some
visits
in
the
north
but
she
came
and
lunched
with
emily
and
was
in
great
form
she
had
her
own
opinion
of
a
number
of
matters
some
of
which
she
discussed
some
of
which
she
kept
to
herself
she
lifted
her
gold
lorgnette
and
looked
emily
well
over
upon
my
word
emily
she
said
i
am
proud
of
you
you
are
one
of
my
successes
your
looks
are
actually
improving
there
something
rather
etherealised
about
your
face
i
quite
agree
with
walderhurst
in
all
the
sentimental
things
he
says
about
you
she
said
this
last
partly
because
she
liked
emily
and
knew
it
would
please
her
to
hear
that
her
husband
went
to
the
length
of
dwelling
on
her
charms
in
his
conversation
with
other
people
partly
because
it
entertained
her
to
see
the
large
creature
eyelids
flutter
and
a
big
blush
sweep
her
cheek
he
really
was
in
great
luck
when
he
discovered
you
her
ladyship
went
on
briskly
as
for
that
i
was
in
luck
myself
suppose
you
had
been
a
girl
who
could
not
have
been
left
as
walderhurst
is
short
of
female
relatives
it
would
have
fallen
to
me
to
decently
you
and
there
would
have
been
the
complications
arising
from
a
girl
being
baby
enough
to
want
to
dance
about
to
places
and
married
enough
to
feel
herself
entitled
to
defy
her
chaperone
she
could
have
been
trusted
to
chaperone
herself
as
it
is
walderhurst
can
go
where
duty
calls
and
i
can
make
my
visits
and
run
about
and
you
dear
thing
are
quite
happy
at
palstrey
playing
lady
bountiful
and
helping
the
little
woman
to
expect
her
baby
i
daresay
you
sit
and
make
dolly
shirts
and
christening
robes
hand
in
hand
we
enjoy
it
all
very
much
emily
answered
adding
imploringly
please
do
call
her
a
little
woman
she
such
a
dear
little
thing
lady
maria
lady
maria
indulged
in
the
familiar
chuckle
and
put
up
her
lorgnette
to
examine
her
again
there
a
certain
kind
of
early
victorian
saintliness
about
you
emily
walderhurst
which
makes
my
joy
she
said
you
remind
me
of
lady
castlewood
helen
pendennis
and
amelia
sedley
with
the
spitefulness
and
priggishness
and
catty
ways
left
out
you
are
as
nice
as
thackeray
they
were
poor
mistaken
man
i
am
not
going
to
suffuse
you
with
blushes
by
explaining
to
you
that
there
is
what
my
nephew
would
call
a
jolly
good
reason
why
if
you
were
not
an
early
victorian
and
improved
thackerayian
saint
you
would
not
be
best
pleased
at
finding
yourself
called
upon
to
assist
at
this
interesting
occasion
another
kind
of
woman
would
probably
feel
like
a
cat
towards
the
little
osborn
but
even
the
mere
reason
itself
as
a
reason
has
not
once
risen
in
your
benign
and
pellucid
mind
you
have
a
pellucid
mind
emily
i
should
be
rather
proud
of
the
word
if
i
had
invented
it
myself
to
describe
you
but
i
did
it
was
walderhurst
you
have
actually
wakened
up
the
intellects
such
as
they
are
she
evidently
had
a
number
of
opinions
of
the
osborns
she
liked
neither
of
them
but
it
was
captain
osborn
she
especially
he
is
really
an
underbred
person
she
explained
and
he
has
the
sharpness
to
know
that
is
the
reason
walderhurst
detests
him
he
had
vulgar
cheap
sort
of
affairs
and
nearly
got
into
the
kind
of
trouble
people
do
forgive
what
a
fool
a
creature
in
his
position
is
to
offend
the
taste
of
the
man
he
may
inherit
from
and
who
if
he
were
not
antagonistic
to
him
would
regard
him
as
a
sort
of
duty
it
was
his
immorality
particularly
nobody
is
either
moral
or
immoral
in
these
days
but
penniless
persons
must
be
decent
it
all
a
matter
of
taste
and
manners
i
have
any
morals
myself
my
dear
but
i
have
beautiful
manners
a
woman
can
have
the
kind
of
manners
which
keep
her
from
breaking
the
commandments
as
to
the
commandments
they
are
awfully
easy
things
to
break
who
wants
to
break
them
good
lord
thou
shall
do
no
murder
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
commit
etc
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
that
simply
gossip
and
lying
and
they
are
bad
manners
if
you
have
good
manners
you
she
chatted
on
in
her
pungent
little
worldly
way
through
the
making
of
a
very
excellent
lunch
after
which
she
settled
her
smart
bonnet
with
clever
touches
kissed
emily
on
both
cheeks
and
getting
into
her
brougham
rolled
off
smiling
and
nodding
emily
stood
at
the
window
and
watched
her
equipage
roll
round
the
square
and
into
charles
street
and
then
turned
away
into
the
big
stately
empty
room
sighing
without
intending
to
do
so
while
she
smiled
herself
she
so
witty
and
so
amusing
she
said
but
one
would
no
more
think
of
her
anything
than
one
would
think
of
catching
a
butterfly
and
holding
it
while
one
made
it
listen
she
would
be
so
if
she
was
confided
in
which
was
most
true
never
in
her
life
had
her
ladyship
allowed
herself
the
indiscretion
of
appearing
a
person
in
whom
confidences
might
be
reposed
she
had
always
had
confidences
enough
of
her
own
to
take
care
of
without
sharing
those
of
other
people
good
heavens
she
had
exclaimed
once
i
should
as
soon
think
of
assuming
another
woman
wrinkles
on
the
first
visit
lady
walderhurst
made
to
the
kennel
farm
the
morning
after
her
return
to
palstrey
when
alec
osborn
helped
her
from
her
carriage
he
was
not
elated
by
the
fact
that
he
had
never
seen
her
look
so
beautifully
alive
and
blooming
during
his
knowledge
of
her
there
was
a
fine
rose
on
her
cheek
and
her
eyes
were
large
and
happily
illumined
how
well
you
look
broke
from
him
with
an
involuntariness
he
was
alarmed
to
realise
as
almost
spiteful
the
words
were
an
actual
exclamation
which
he
had
not
meant
to
utter
and
emily
walderhurst
even
started
a
trifle
and
looked
at
him
with
a
moment
question
but
you
look
well
too
she
answered
palstrey
agrees
with
both
of
us
you
have
such
a
colour
i
have
been
riding
he
replied
i
told
you
i
meant
to
know
faustine
thoroughly
before
i
let
you
mount
her
she
is
ready
for
you
now
can
you
take
your
first
lesson
i
i
do
quite
know
she
hesitated
i
will
tell
you
a
little
later
where
is
hester
hester
was
in
the
she
was
lying
on
a
sofa
before
an
open
window
and
looking
rather
haggard
and
miserable
she
had
in
fact
just
had
a
curious
talk
with
alec
which
had
ended
in
something
like
a
scene
as
hester
health
grew
more
frail
her
temper
became
more
fierce
and
of
late
there
had
been
times
when
a
certain
savagery
concealed
with
difficulty
in
her
husband
moods
affected
her
horribly
this
morning
she
felt
a
new
character
in
emily
manner
she
was
timid
and
shy
and
a
little
awkward
her
openness
of
speech
and
humour
seemed
obscured
she
had
less
to
say
than
usual
and
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
suggestion
of
restless
unease
about
her
hester
osborn
after
a
few
minutes
began
to
have
an
odd
feeling
that
the
woman
eyes
held
a
question
or
a
desire
in
them
she
had
brought
some
superb
roses
from
the
manor
gardens
and
she
moved
about
arranging
them
for
hester
in
vases
it
is
beautiful
to
come
back
to
the
country
she
said
when
i
get
into
the
carriage
at
the
station
and
drive
through
the
sweet
air
i
always
feel
as
if
i
were
beginning
to
live
again
and
as
if
in
london
i
had
not
been
quite
alive
it
seemed
so
in
the
rose
garden
at
palstrey
to
walk
about
among
those
thousands
of
blooming
lovely
things
breathing
scent
and
nodding
their
heavy
darling
heads
the
roads
are
in
a
beautiful
condition
for
riding
hester
said
and
alec
says
that
faustine
is
perfect
you
ought
to
begin
morning
shall
you
she
spoke
the
words
somewhat
slowly
and
her
face
did
not
look
happy
but
then
it
never
was
a
really
happy
face
the
days
of
her
youth
had
been
too
full
of
the
ironies
of
disappointment
there
was
a
second
silence
and
then
she
said
again
shall
you
if
it
continues
fine
emily
hands
were
full
of
roses
both
hands
and
hester
saw
both
hands
and
roses
tremble
she
turned
round
slowly
and
came
towards
her
she
looked
nervous
awkward
abashed
and
as
if
for
that
moment
she
was
a
big
girl
of
sixteen
appealing
to
her
and
overwhelmed
with
queer
feelings
and
yet
the
depths
of
her
eyes
held
a
kind
of
trembling
ecstatic
light
she
came
and
stood
before
her
holding
the
trembling
roses
as
if
she
had
been
called
up
for
confession
i
i
must
she
half
whispered
the
corners
of
her
lips
drooped
and
quivered
and
her
voice
was
so
low
that
hester
could
scarcely
hear
it
but
she
started
and
half
sat
up
you
she
gasped
yes
really
it
was
gasped
emily
hand
trembled
so
that
the
roses
began
to
fall
one
by
one
scattering
a
rain
of
petals
as
they
dropped
i
must
she
repeated
low
and
shakily
i
had
i
went
to
town
to
see
somebody
i
saw
sir
samuel
brent
and
he
told
me
i
must
not
he
is
quite
sure
she
tried
to
calm
herself
and
smile
but
the
smile
quivered
and
ended
in
a
pathetic
contortion
of
her
face
in
the
hope
of
gaining
decent
she
bent
down
to
pick
up
the
dropped
roses
before
she
had
picked
up
two
she
let
all
the
rest
fall
and
sank
kneeling
among
them
her
face
in
her
hands
oh
hester
hester
she
panted
with
sweet
stupid
unconciousness
of
the
other
woman
heaving
chest
and
glaring
eyes
it
has
come
to
me
too
actually
after
all
chapter
fifteen
the
palstrey
manor
carriage
had
just
rolled
away
carrying
lady
walderhurst
home
the
big
parlour
was
full
of
the
deep
golden
sunlight
of
the
late
afternoon
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
scent
of
roses
and
and
mignonette
the
adorable
fragrance
of
english
rooms
captain
osborn
inhaled
it
at
each
breath
as
he
stood
and
looked
out
of
the
window
watching
the
landau
out
of
sight
he
felt
the
scent
and
the
golden
glow
of
the
sunset
light
as
intensely
as
he
felt
the
dead
silence
which
reigned
between
himself
and
hester
almost
with
the
effect
of
a
physical
presence
hester
was
lying
upon
the
sofa
again
and
he
knew
she
was
staring
at
his
back
with
that
sardonic
widening
of
her
long
eyes
a
thing
he
hated
and
which
always
foreboded
things
not
pleasant
to
face
he
did
not
turn
to
face
them
until
the
footman
cockade
had
disappeared
finally
behind
the
tall
hedge
and
the
tramp
of
the
horses
feet
was
deadening
itself
in
the
lane
when
he
ceased
watching
and
listening
he
wheeled
round
suddenly
what
does
it
all
mean
he
demanded
hang
her
foolish
airs
and
wo
she
ride
for
she
evidently
does
not
intend
to
hester
laughed
a
hard
short
savage
little
sound
it
was
no
she
does
intend
to
she
answered
for
many
a
long
day
at
least
for
many
a
month
she
has
sir
samuel
brent
orders
to
take
the
greatest
care
of
herself
brent
brent
hester
struck
her
lean
little
hands
together
and
laughed
this
time
with
a
hint
at
hysteric
shrillness
i
told
you
so
i
told
you
so
she
cried
i
knew
it
would
be
so
i
knew
it
by
the
time
she
reaches
her
birthday
there
will
be
a
new
marquis
of
walderhurst
and
he
wo
be
either
you
or
yours
and
as
she
finished
she
rolled
over
on
the
sofa
and
bit
the
cushions
with
her
teeth
as
she
lay
face
downwards
on
them
he
wo
be
you
or
belong
to
you
she
reiterated
and
then
she
struck
the
cushions
with
her
clenched
fist
he
rushed
over
to
her
and
seizing
her
by
the
shoulders
shook
her
to
and
fro
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
he
said
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
i
do
i
do
i
do
she
screamed
under
her
breath
and
beat
the
cushions
at
every
word
it
true
it
true
she
drivelling
about
it
drivelling
alec
osborn
threw
back
his
head
drawing
in
a
hard
breath
which
was
almost
a
snort
of
fury
by
god
he
cried
if
she
went
out
on
faustine
now
she
would
not
come
back
his
rage
had
made
him
so
far
beside
himself
that
he
had
said
more
than
he
intended
far
more
than
he
would
have
felt
safe
but
the
girl
was
as
far
beside
herself
as
he
was
and
she
took
him
up
serve
her
right
she
cried
i
should
care
i
hate
her
i
hate
her
i
told
you
once
i
could
but
i
do
she
the
biggest
fool
that
ever
lived
she
knew
of
what
i
felt
i
believe
she
thought
i
would
rejoice
with
her
i
did
know
whether
i
should
shriek
in
her
face
or
scream
out
laughing
her
eyes
were
as
big
as
saucers
and
she
looked
at
me
as
if
she
felt
like
the
virgin
mary
after
the
annunciation
oh
the
stupid
fool
her
words
rushed
forth
faster
and
faster
she
caught
her
breath
with
gasps
and
her
voice
grew
more
shrill
at
every
sentence
osborn
shook
her
again
keep
quiet
he
ordered
her
you
are
going
into
hysterics
and
it
wo
do
get
hold
of
yourself
go
for
ameerah
she
gasped
or
i
afraid
i
ca
she
knows
what
to
do
he
went
for
ameerah
and
the
silently
gliding
creature
came
bringing
her
remedies
with
her
she
looked
at
her
mistress
with
stealthily
questioning
but
affectionate
eyes
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
rubbing
her
hands
and
feet
in
a
sort
of
soothing
massage
osborn
went
out
of
the
room
and
the
two
women
were
left
together
ameerah
knew
many
ways
of
calming
her
mistress
nerves
and
perhaps
one
of
the
chief
ones
was
to
lead
her
by
subtle
powers
to
talk
out
her
rages
and
anxieties
hester
never
knew
that
she
was
revealing
herself
and
her
moods
until
after
her
interviews
with
the
ayah
were
over
sometimes
an
hour
or
so
had
passed
before
she
began
to
realise
that
she
had
let
out
things
which
she
had
meant
to
keep
secret
it
was
never
ameerah
who
talked
and
hester
was
never
conscious
that
she
talked
very
much
herself
but
afterwards
she
saw
that
the
few
sentences
she
had
uttered
were
such
as
would
satisfy
curiosity
if
the
ayah
felt
it
also
she
was
not
on
the
whole
at
all
sure
that
the
woman
felt
it
she
showed
no
outward
sign
of
any
interest
other
than
the
interest
of
a
deep
affection
she
loved
her
young
mistress
as
passionately
as
she
had
loved
her
as
a
child
when
she
had
held
her
in
her
bosom
as
if
she
had
been
her
own
by
the
time
emily
walderhurst
had
reached
palstrey
ameerah
knew
many
things
she
understood
that
her
mistress
was
as
one
who
standing
upon
the
brink
of
a
precipice
was
being
slowly
but
surely
pushed
over
its
edge
pushed
pushed
by
fate
this
was
the
thing
imaged
in
her
mind
when
she
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
and
stood
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
chamber
clenching
her
dark
hands
high
above
her
white
veiled
head
and
uttering
curses
which
were
spells
and
spells
which
were
curses
emily
was
glad
that
she
had
elected
to
be
alone
as
much
as
possible
and
had
not
invited
people
to
come
and
stay
with
her
she
had
not
invited
people
in
honest
truth
because
she
felt
shy
of
the
responsibility
of
entertainment
while
walderhurst
was
not
with
her
it
would
have
been
proper
to
invite
his
friends
and
his
friends
were
all
people
she
was
too
much
in
awe
of
and
too
desirous
to
please
to
be
able
to
enjoy
frankly
as
society
she
had
told
herself
that
when
she
had
been
married
a
few
years
she
would
be
braver
and
now
her
gladness
was
so
devout
that
it
was
pure
rejoicing
how
could
she
have
been
calm
how
could
she
have
been
conversational
while
through
her
whole
being
there
surged
but
one
thought
she
was
sure
that
while
she
talked
to
people
she
would
have
been
guilty
of
looking
as
if
she
was
thinking
of
something
not
in
the
least
connected
with
themselves
if
she
had
been
less
romantically
sentimental
in
her
desire
to
avoid
all
semblance
of
burdening
her
husband
she
would
have
ordered
him
home
at
once
and
demanded
as
a
right
the
protection
of
his
dignity
and
presence
if
she
had
been
less
humble
she
would
have
felt
the
importance
of
her
position
and
the
gravity
of
the
claims
it
gave
her
to
his
consideration
instead
of
being
lost
in
prayerful
gratitude
to
heaven
she
had
been
rather
stupidly
mistaken
in
not
making
a
confidante
of
lady
maria
bayne
but
she
had
been
in
her
big
girl
shyness
entirely
like
herself
in
some
remote
part
of
her
nature
she
had
shrunk
from
a
certain
look
of
delighted
amusement
which
she
had
known
would
have
betrayed
itself
despite
her
ladyship
good
intentions
in
the
eyes
assisted
by
the
smart
gold
lorgnette
she
knew
she
was
inclined
to
be
on
this
subject
and
she
felt
that
if
she
had
seen
the
humour
trying
to
conceal
itself
behind
the
she
might
have
been
hysterical
enough
to
cry
even
while
she
tried
to
laugh
and
pass
her
feeling
off
lightly
oh
no
oh
no
somehow
she
that
at
such
a
moment
for
some
fantastic
if
subtle
reason
lady
maria
would
only
see
her
as
emily
that
she
would
have
actually
figured
before
her
for
an
instant
as
poor
emily
making
an
odd
confession
she
could
not
have
endured
it
without
doing
something
foolish
she
felt
that
she
would
not
indeed
so
lady
maria
went
gaily
away
to
make
her
round
of
visits
and
be
the
amusing
old
life
and
soul
of
after
suspecting
nothing
of
a
possibility
which
would
actually
have
sobered
her
for
a
moment
emily
passed
her
days
at
palstrey
in
a
state
of
happy
exaltation
for
a
week
or
so
they
were
spent
in
wondering
whether
or
not
she
should
write
a
letter
to
lord
walderhurst
which
should
convey
the
information
to
him
which
even
lady
maria
would
have
regarded
as
important
but
the
more
she
argued
the
question
with
herself
the
less
she
wavered
from
her
first
intention
lady
maria
frank
congratulation
of
herself
and
lord
walderhurst
in
his
wife
entire
unexactingness
had
indeed
been
the
outcome
of
a
intention
to
dissipate
amiably
even
the
vaguest
inclination
to
verge
on
expecting
things
from
people
while
she
thought
emily
unlikely
to
allow
herself
to
deteriorate
into
an
encumbrance
her
ladyship
had
seen
women
in
her
position
before
whose
marriages
had
made
perfect
fools
of
them
through
causing
them
to
lose
their
heads
completely
and
require
concessions
and
attentions
from
their
newly
acquired
relations
which
bored
everybody
so
she
had
lightly
patted
and
praised
emily
for
the
course
of
action
she
preferred
to
keep
her
up
to
she
the
kind
of
woman
ideas
sink
into
if
they
are
well
put
she
had
remarked
in
times
gone
by
she
not
sharp
enough
to
see
that
things
are
being
suggested
to
her
but
a
suggestion
acts
upon
her
delightfully
her
suggestions
acted
upon
emily
as
she
walked
about
the
gardens
at
palstrey
pondering
in
the
sunshine
and
soothed
by
the
flower
scents
of
the
warmed
borders
such
a
letter
written
to
walderhurst
might
change
his
cherished
plans
concerning
which
she
knew
he
held
certain
ambitions
he
had
been
so
far
absorbed
in
them
that
he
had
gone
to
india
at
a
time
of
the
year
which
was
not
usually
chosen
for
the
journey
he
had
become
further
interested
and
absorbed
after
he
had
reached
the
country
and
he
was
evidently
likely
to
prolong
his
stay
as
he
had
not
thought
of
prolonging
it
he
wrote
regularly
though
not
frequently
and
emily
had
gathered
from
the
tone
of
his
letters
that
he
was
more
interested
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
before
i
would
not
interfere
with
his
work
for
anything
in
the
world
she
said
he
cares
more
for
it
than
he
usually
cares
for
things
i
care
for
everything
i
have
that
kind
of
mind
an
intellectual
person
is
different
i
am
perfectly
well
and
happy
here
and
it
will
be
so
nice
to
look
forward
she
was
not
aware
how
lady
maria
suggestions
had
sunk
in
she
would
probably
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
without
their
having
been
made
but
since
they
had
been
made
they
had
assisted
her
there
was
one
thing
of
all
others
she
felt
she
could
not
possibly
bear
which
was
to
realise
that
she
herself
could
bring
to
her
james
face
an
expression
she
had
once
or
twice
seen
others
bring
there
captain
osborn
notably
an
expression
of
silent
boredom
on
the
verge
of
irritation
even
radiant
domestic
joy
might
not
be
able
to
overrule
this
if
just
at
this
particular
juncture
he
found
himself
placed
in
the
position
of
a
man
whom
decency
compelled
to
take
the
next
steamer
to
england
if
she
had
felt
tenderly
towards
hester
osborn
before
the
feeling
was
now
increased
tenfold
she
went
to
see
her
oftener
she
began
to
try
to
persuade
her
to
come
and
stay
at
palstrey
she
was
all
the
more
kind
because
hester
seemed
less
well
and
was
in
desperate
ill
spirits
her
small
face
had
grown
thin
and
yellow
she
had
dark
rings
under
her
eyes
and
her
little
hands
were
hot
and
looked
like
bird
claws
she
did
not
sleep
and
had
lost
her
appetite
you
must
come
and
stay
at
palstrey
for
a
few
days
emily
said
to
her
the
mere
change
from
one
house
to
another
may
make
you
sleep
better
but
hester
was
not
inclined
to
avail
herself
of
the
invitation
she
made
obstacles
and
delayed
acceptance
for
one
reason
and
another
she
was
in
fact
all
the
more
reluctant
because
her
husband
wished
her
to
make
the
visit
their
opposed
opinions
had
resulted
in
one
of
their
scenes
i
wo
go
she
had
said
at
first
i
tell
you
i
wo
you
will
he
answered
it
will
be
better
for
you
will
it
be
worse
for
me
if
i
do
she
laughed
feverishly
and
how
will
it
be
better
for
you
if
i
do
i
know
you
are
in
it
he
lost
his
temper
and
was
indiscreet
as
his
temper
continually
betrayed
him
into
being
yes
i
am
in
it
he
said
through
his
teeth
as
you
might
have
the
sense
to
see
everything
is
the
better
for
us
that
throws
us
with
them
and
makes
them
familiar
with
the
thought
of
us
and
our
rights
our
rights
the
words
were
a
shrill
taunt
what
rights
have
you
likely
to
be
recognised
unless
you
kill
her
are
you
going
to
kill
her
he
had
a
moment
of
insanity
i
kill
her
and
you
too
if
it
was
safe
to
do
it
you
both
deserve
it
he
flung
across
the
room
having
lost
his
wits
as
well
as
his
temper
but
a
second
later
both
came
back
to
him
as
in
a
revulsion
of
feeling
i
talk
like
a
melodramatic
fool
he
cried
oh
hester
forgive
me
he
knelt
on
the
floor
by
her
side
caressing
her
imploringly
we
both
take
fire
in
the
same
way
we
are
both
driven
crazy
by
this
damned
blow
we
beaten
we
may
as
well
own
it
and
take
what
we
can
get
she
a
fool
but
she
better
than
that
pompous
stiff
brute
walderhurst
and
she
has
a
lot
of
pull
over
him
he
knows
nothing
about
the
smug
animal
is
falling
in
love
with
her
in
his
way
she
can
make
him
do
the
decent
thing
let
us
keep
friends
with
her
the
decent
thing
would
be
a
thousand
a
year
wailed
hester
giving
in
to
his
contrition
in
spite
of
herself
because
she
had
once
been
in
love
with
him
and
because
she
was
utterly
helpless
five
hundred
a
year
would
be
indecent
let
us
keep
on
her
good
side
he
said
fondling
her
with
a
relieved
countenance
tell
her
you
will
come
and
that
she
is
an
angel
and
that
you
are
sure
a
visit
to
the
manor
will
save
your
life
they
went
to
palstrey
a
few
days
later
ameerah
accompanied
them
in
attendance
upon
her
mistress
and
the
three
settled
down
into
a
life
so
regular
that
it
scarcely
seemed
to
wear
the
aspect
of
a
visit
the
osborns
were
given
some
of
the
most
beautiful
and
convenient
rooms
in
the
house
no
other
visitors
were
impending
and
the
whole
big
place
was
at
their
disposal
hester
boudoir
overlooked
the
most
perfect
nooks
of
garden
and
its
sweet
chintz
draperies
and
cushions
and
books
and
flowers
made
it
a
luxurious
abode
of
peace
what
shall
i
do
she
said
on
the
first
evening
in
it
as
she
sat
in
a
soft
chair
by
the
window
looking
out
at
the
twilight
and
talking
to
emily
what
shall
i
do
when
i
must
go
away
i
do
mean
only
from
here
i
mean
away
from
england
to
loathly
india
do
you
dislike
it
so
emily
asked
roused
to
a
new
conception
of
her
feeling
by
her
tone
i
could
never
describe
to
you
how
much
fiercely
it
is
like
going
to
the
place
which
is
the
opposite
of
heaven
i
did
not
know
that
pityingly
perhaps
i
wonder
if
something
might
not
be
done
i
must
talk
to
my
husband
ameerah
seemed
to
develop
an
odd
fancy
for
the
society
of
jane
cupp
which
jane
was
obliged
to
confess
to
her
mistress
had
a
tendency
to
produce
in
her
system
the
creeps
you
must
try
to
overcome
it
jane
lady
walderhurst
said
i
afraid
it
because
of
her
colour
i
felt
a
little
silly
and
shy
about
her
myself
but
it
is
nice
of
us
you
ought
to
read
tom
cabin
and
all
about
that
poor
religious
uncle
tom
and
legree
and
eliza
crossing
the
river
on
the
blocks
of
ice
i
have
read
it
twice
your
ladyship
was
jane
earnestly
regretful
response
and
most
awful
it
is
and
made
me
and
mother
cry
beyond
words
and
i
suppose
it
is
the
poor
creature
colour
that
against
her
and
i
trying
to
be
kind
to
her
but
i
must
own
that
she
makes
me
nervous
she
asks
me
such
a
lot
of
questions
in
her
queer
way
and
stares
at
me
so
quiet
she
actually
asked
me
quite
sudden
the
other
day
if
i
loved
the
big
mem
sahib
i
did
know
what
she
mean
at
first
but
after
a
while
i
found
out
it
was
her
indian
way
of
meaning
your
ladyship
and
she
did
intend
disrespect
because
she
spoke
of
you
most
humble
afterwards
and
called
his
lordship
the
heaven
born
be
as
kind
as
you
can
to
her
jane
instructed
her
mistress
and
take
her
a
nice
walk
occasionally
i
daresay
she
feels
very
homesick
here
what
ameerah
said
to
her
mistress
was
that
these
english
servant
women
were
pigs
and
devils
and
could
conceal
nothing
from
those
who
chose
to
find
out
things
from
them
if
jane
had
known
that
the
ayah
could
have
told
her
of
every
movement
she
made
during
the
day
or
night
of
her
and
of
the
hour
and
moment
of
every
service
done
for
the
big
mem
sahib
of
why
and
how
and
when
and
where
each
thing
was
done
she
would
have
been
frightened
indeed
one
day
it
is
true
she
came
into
lady
walderhurst
sleeping
apartment
to
find
ameerah
standing
in
the
middle
of
it
looking
round
its
contents
with
restless
timid
bewildered
eyes
she
wore
indeed
the
manner
of
an
alarmed
creature
who
did
not
know
how
she
had
got
there
what
are
you
doing
here
demanded
jane
you
have
no
right
in
this
part
of
the
house
you
taking
a
great
liberty
and
your
mistress
will
be
angry
my
mem
sahib
asked
for
a
book
the
ayah
quite
shivered
in
her
alarmed
confusion
your
mem
sahib
said
it
was
here
they
did
not
order
me
but
i
thought
i
would
come
to
you
i
did
not
know
it
was
forbidden
what
was
the
book
inquired
jane
severely
i
will
take
it
to
her
ladyship
but
ameerah
was
so
frightened
that
she
had
forgotten
the
name
and
when
jane
knocked
at
the
door
of
osborn
boudoir
it
was
empty
both
the
ladies
having
gone
into
the
garden
but
ameerah
story
was
quite
true
lady
walderhurst
said
in
the
evening
when
jane
spoke
of
the
matter
as
she
dressed
her
for
dinner
they
had
been
speaking
of
a
book
containing
records
of
certain
historical
walderhursts
it
was
one
emily
had
taken
from
the
library
to
read
in
her
bedroom
we
did
not
ask
her
to
go
for
it
in
fact
i
did
not
know
the
woman
was
within
hearing
she
moves
about
so
noiselessly
one
frequently
does
not
know
when
she
is
near
of
course
she
meant
very
well
but
she
does
not
know
our
english
ways
no
my
lady
she
does
not
said
jane
respectfully
but
firmly
i
took
the
liberty
of
telling
her
she
must
keep
to
her
own
part
of
the
house
unless
required
by
your
ladyship
you
must
frighten
the
poor
creature
laughed
her
mistress
she
was
rather
touched
indeed
by
the
slavish
desire
to
please
and
do
service
swiftly
which
the
ayah
blunder
seemed
to
indicate
she
had
wished
to
save
her
mistress
even
the
trouble
of
giving
the
order
that
was
her
oriental
way
emily
thought
and
it
was
very
affectionate
and
being
reminded
of
the
book
again
she
carried
it
down
herself
into
the
it
was
a
volume
she
was
fond
of
because
it
recorded
romantic
stories
of
certain
noble
dames
of
walderhurst
lineage
her
special
predilection
was
a
dame
ellena
who
being
left
with
but
few
servitors
in
attendance
during
her
lord
absence
from
his
castle
on
a
foraging
journey
into
an
enemy
country
had
defended
the
stronghold
boldly
against
the
attack
of
a
second
enemy
who
had
adroitly
seized
the
opportunity
to
forage
for
himself
in
the
cellars
had
been
hidden
treasure
recently
acquired
by
the
usual
means
and
knowing
this
dame
ellena
had
done
splendid
deeds
marshalling
her
small
forces
in
such
way
as
deceived
the
attacking
party
and
showing
herself
in
scorn
upon
the
battlements
a
fierce
beauteous
woman
about
to
give
her
lord
an
heir
yet
fearing
naught
and
only
made
more
fierce
and
full
of
courage
by
this
fact
the
son
born
but
three
weeks
later
had
been
the
most
splendid
and
savage
fighter
of
his
name
and
a
giant
in
build
and
strength
i
suppose
emily
said
when
they
discussed
the
legend
after
dinner
i
suppose
she
felt
that
she
could
do
with
her
italics
i
daresay
could
make
her
afraid
but
the
thought
that
something
might
go
wrong
while
her
husband
was
away
and
strength
was
given
her
she
was
so
thrilled
that
she
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
with
quite
a
fine
sweep
of
heroic
movement
in
her
momentary
excitement
she
held
her
head
up
and
smiled
with
widening
eyes
but
she
saw
captain
osborn
drag
at
his
black
moustache
to
hide
an
unattractive
grin
and
she
was
at
once
abashed
into
feeling
silly
and
shy
she
sat
down
again
with
awkward
i
afraid
i
making
you
laugh
at
me
she
apologised
but
that
story
always
gives
me
such
a
romantic
feeling
i
like
her
so
oh
not
at
all
not
all
said
osborn
i
was
not
laughing
really
oh
no
but
he
had
been
and
had
been
secretly
calling
her
a
sentimental
ramping
idiot
it
was
a
great
day
for
jane
cupp
when
her
mother
arrived
at
palstrey
manor
it
was
a
great
day
for
cupp
also
when
she
descended
from
the
train
at
the
little
country
station
warm
and
somewhat
flushed
by
her
emotions
and
the
bugled
splendours
of
her
best
bonnet
and
black
silk
mantle
the
sight
of
jane
standing
neatly
upon
the
platform
almost
overcame
her
being
led
to
his
lordship
own
private
bus
and
seeing
her
trunk
surrounded
by
the
attentions
of
an
obsequious
and
a
liveried
young
man
she
was
conscious
of
concealing
a
flutter
with
dignified
reserve
my
word
jane
she
exclaimed
after
they
had
taken
their
seats
in
the
vehicle
my
word
you
look
as
accustomed
to
it
as
if
you
had
been
born
in
the
family
but
it
was
when
after
she
had
been
introduced
to
the
society
in
the
servants
hall
she
was
settled
in
her
comfortable
room
next
to
own
that
she
realised
to
the
full
that
there
were
features
of
her
position
which
marked
it
with
importance
almost
startling
as
jane
talked
to
her
the
heat
of
the
genteel
bonnet
and
beaded
mantle
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
warmth
which
moistened
her
brow
i
thought
i
keep
it
till
i
saw
you
mother
said
the
girl
decorously
i
know
what
her
ladyship
feels
about
being
talked
over
if
i
was
a
lady
myself
i
should
like
it
and
i
know
how
deep
feel
it
that
when
the
doctor
advised
her
to
get
an
experienced
married
person
to
be
at
hand
she
said
in
that
dear
way
of
hers
if
your
uncle
could
spare
your
mother
how
i
should
like
to
have
her
i
never
forgot
her
kindness
in
mortimer
street
cupp
fanned
her
face
with
a
handkerchief
of
notable
freshness
if
she
was
her
majesty
she
said
she
could
be
more
sacred
to
me
nor
me
more
happy
to
be
allowed
the
privilege
jane
had
begun
to
put
her
mother
belongings
away
she
was
folding
and
patting
a
skirt
on
the
bed
she
fussed
about
a
little
nervously
and
then
lifted
a
rather
embarrassed
face
i
glad
you
here
mother
she
said
i
thankful
to
you
cupp
ceased
fanning
and
stared
at
her
with
a
change
of
expression
she
found
herself
involuntarily
asking
her
next
question
in
a
half
whisper
why
jane
what
is
it
jane
came
nearer
i
do
know
she
answered
and
her
voice
also
was
low
perhaps
silly
and
overanxious
because
i
so
fond
of
her
but
that
ameerah
i
actually
dream
about
her
what
the
black
woman
if
i
was
to
say
a
word
or
if
you
did
and
we
was
wrong
how
should
we
feel
i
kept
my
nerves
to
myself
till
i
nearly
screamed
sometimes
and
my
lady
would
be
so
hurt
if
she
knew
but
well
in
a
hurried
outburst
i
do
wish
his
lordship
was
here
and
i
do
wish
the
osborns
was
i
do
wish
it
i
tell
you
that
good
lord
cried
cupp
and
after
staring
with
alarmed
eyes
a
second
or
so
she
wiped
a
slight
dampness
from
her
upper
lip
she
was
of
the
order
of
female
likely
to
take
a
somewhat
melodramatic
view
of
any
case
offering
her
an
opening
in
that
direction
jane
she
gasped
faintly
do
you
think
they
try
to
take
her
life
goodness
no
ejaculated
jane
with
even
a
trifle
of
impatience
people
like
them
dare
but
suppose
they
was
to
try
to
well
to
upset
her
in
some
way
what
a
thing
for
them
it
would
be
after
which
the
two
women
talked
together
for
some
time
in
whispers
jane
bringing
a
chair
to
place
opposite
her
mother
they
sat
knee
to
knee
and
now
and
then
jane
shed
a
tear
from
pure
nervousness
she
was
so
appalled
by
the
fear
of
making
a
mistake
which
being
revealed
by
some
chance
would
bring
confusion
upon
and
pain
of
mind
to
her
lady
at
all
events
was
cupp
weighty
observation
when
their
conference
was
at
an
end
here
we
both
are
and
two
pairs
of
eyes
and
ears
and
hands
and
legs
is
a
fat
lot
better
than
one
where
things
to
be
looked
out
for
her
training
in
the
matter
of
subtlety
had
not
been
such
as
ameerah
and
it
may
not
be
regarded
as
altogether
improbable
that
her
observation
of
the
ayah
was
at
times
not
too
adroitly
concealed
but
if
the
native
woman
knew
that
she
was
being
remarked
she
gave
no
sign
of
her
knowledge
she
performed
her
duties
faithfully
and
silently
she
gave
no
trouble
and
showed
a
gentle
subservience
and
humbleness
towards
the
white
servants
which
won
immense
approbation
her
manner
towards
cupp
self
was
marked
indeed
by
something
like
a
tinge
of
awed
deference
which
it
must
be
confessed
mollified
the
good
woman
and
awakened
in
her
a
desire
to
be
just
and
lenient
even
to
the
dark
of
skin
and
alien
of
birth
she
knows
her
betters
when
she
sees
them
and
has
pretty
enough
manners
for
a
black
the
object
of
her
respectful
obeisances
remarked
i
wonder
if
she
ever
heard
of
her
maker
and
if
a
little
brown
testament
with
good
print
would
be
a
good
thing
to
give
her
this
boon
was
in
fact
bestowed
upon
her
as
a
gift
cupp
bought
it
for
a
shilling
at
a
small
shop
in
the
village
ameerah
in
whose
dusky
being
was
incorporated
the
occult
faith
of
lost
centuries
and
whose
gods
had
been
gods
through
mystic
ages
received
the
fat
little
brown
book
with
lids
and
grateful
obeisance
these
were
her
words
to
her
mistress
the
fat
old
woman
with
protruding
eyes
bestowed
it
upon
me
she
says
it
is
the
book
of
her
god
she
has
but
one
she
wishes
me
to
worship
him
am
i
a
babe
to
worship
such
a
god
as
would
please
her
she
is
old
and
has
lost
her
mind
lady
walderhurst
health
continued
all
that
could
be
desired
she
arose
smiling
in
the
morning
and
bore
her
smile
about
with
her
all
day
she
walked
much
in
the
gardens
and
spent
long
happy
hours
sewing
in
her
favourite
work
which
she
might
have
paid
other
women
to
do
she
did
with
her
own
hands
for
the
mere
sentimental
bliss
of
it
sometimes
she
sat
with
hester
and
sewed
and
hester
lay
on
a
sofa
and
stared
at
her
moving
hands
you
know
how
to
do
it
do
you
she
once
said
i
was
obliged
to
sew
for
myself
when
i
was
so
poor
and
this
is
delightful
was
emily
answer
but
you
could
buy
it
all
and
save
yourself
the
trouble
emily
stroked
her
bit
of
cambric
and
looked
awkward
i
rather
not
she
said
well
as
she
was
she
began
to
think
she
did
not
sleep
quite
so
soundly
as
had
been
habitual
with
her
she
started
up
in
bed
now
and
again
as
if
she
had
been
disturbed
by
some
noise
but
when
she
waited
and
listened
she
heard
nothing
at
least
this
happened
on
two
or
three
occasions
and
then
one
night
having
been
lying
folded
in
profound
sweet
sleep
she
sprang
up
in
the
black
darkness
wakened
by
an
actual
physical
reality
of
sensation
the
soft
laying
of
a
hand
upon
her
naked
side
that
and
nothing
else
what
is
that
who
is
there
she
cried
someone
is
in
the
room
yes
someone
was
there
a
few
feet
from
her
bed
she
heard
a
sobbing
sigh
then
a
rustle
then
followed
silence
she
struck
a
match
and
getting
up
lighted
candles
her
hand
shook
but
she
remembered
that
she
must
be
firm
with
herself
i
must
not
be
nervous
she
said
and
looked
the
room
over
from
end
to
end
but
it
contained
no
living
creature
nor
any
sign
that
living
creature
had
entered
it
since
she
had
lain
down
to
rest
gradually
the
fast
beating
of
her
heart
had
slackened
and
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
face
in
bewilderment
it
was
like
a
dream
at
all
she
murmured
it
really
was
i
it
still
as
absolutely
nothing
was
to
be
found
the
sense
of
reality
diminished
somewhat
and
being
so
healthy
a
creature
she
regained
her
composure
and
on
going
back
to
bed
slept
well
until
jane
brought
her
early
tea
under
the
influence
of
fresh
morning
air
and
sunlight
of
ordinary
breakfast
and
breakfast
talk
with
the
osborns
her
first
convictions
receded
so
far
that
she
laughed
a
little
as
she
related
the
incident
i
never
had
such
a
real
dream
in
my
life
she
said
but
it
must
have
been
a
dream
one
dreams
are
very
real
sometimes
said
hester
perhaps
it
was
the
palstrey
ghost
osborn
laughed
it
came
to
you
because
you
ignore
it
he
broke
off
with
a
slight
sudden
start
and
stared
at
her
a
second
questioningly
did
you
say
it
put
its
hand
on
your
side
he
asked
do
tell
her
silly
things
that
will
frighten
her
how
ridiculous
of
you
exclaimed
hester
sharply
it
not
proper
emily
looked
at
both
of
them
wonderingly
what
do
you
mean
she
said
i
do
believe
in
ghosts
it
frighten
me
hester
i
never
even
heard
of
a
palstrey
ghost
then
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
of
one
said
captain
osborn
a
little
brusquely
and
he
left
his
chair
and
went
to
the
sideboard
to
cut
cold
beef
he
kept
his
back
towards
them
and
his
shoulders
looked
uncommunicative
and
slightly
obstinate
hester
face
was
sullen
emily
thought
it
sweet
of
her
to
care
so
much
and
turned
upon
her
with
grateful
eyes
i
was
only
frightened
for
a
few
minutes
hester
she
said
my
dreams
are
not
vivid
at
all
usually
but
howsoever
bravely
she
ignored
the
shock
she
had
received
it
was
not
without
its
effect
which
was
that
occasionally
there
drifted
into
her
mind
a
recollection
of
the
suggestion
that
palstrey
had
a
ghost
she
had
never
heard
of
it
and
was
in
fact
of
an
orthodoxy
so
ingenuously
entire
as
to
make
her
feel
that
belief
in
the
existence
of
such
things
was
a
sort
of
defiance
of
ecclesiastical
laws
still
such
stories
were
often
told
in
connection
with
old
places
and
it
was
natural
to
wonder
what
features
marked
this
particular
legend
did
it
lay
hands
on
sides
when
they
were
asleep
captain
osborn
had
asked
his
question
as
if
with
a
sudden
sense
of
recognition
but
she
would
not
let
herself
think
of
the
matter
and
she
would
not
make
inquiries
the
result
was
that
she
did
not
sleep
well
for
several
nights
she
was
annoyed
at
herself
because
she
found
that
she
kept
lying
awake
as
if
listening
or
waiting
and
it
was
not
a
good
thing
to
lose
one
sleep
when
one
wanted
particularly
to
keep
strong
jane
cupp
during
this
week
was
to
use
her
own
words
given
quite
a
turn
by
an
incident
which
though
a
small
matter
might
have
proved
untoward
in
its
results
the
house
at
palstrey
despite
its
age
was
in
a
wonderful
state
of
preservation
the
carved
oak
balustrades
of
the
stairways
being
considered
particularly
fine
what
but
providence
said
jane
piously
in
speaking
to
her
mother
the
next
morning
made
me
look
down
the
staircase
as
i
passed
through
the
upper
landing
just
before
my
lady
was
going
down
to
dinner
what
but
providence
i
could
say
it
certainly
was
because
i
done
it
before
that
i
remember
but
just
that
one
evening
i
was
obliged
to
cross
the
landing
for
something
and
my
eye
just
lowered
itself
by
accident
and
there
it
was
just
where
it
would
have
tripped
her
up
good
lord
it
makes
my
heart
turn
over
to
hear
you
tell
it
how
big
a
bit
of
carving
was
it
cupp
opulent
chest
trimmings
heaved
only
a
small
piece
that
had
broken
off
from
old
age
and
i
suppose
but
it
had
dropped
just
where
she
would
have
caught
sight
of
it
and
ten
to
one
would
have
stepped
on
it
and
turned
her
ankle
and
been
thrown
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
whole
flight
suppose
i
seen
it
in
time
to
pick
it
up
before
she
went
down
oh
dear
oh
dear
mother
i
should
say
so
cupp
manner
approached
the
devout
this
incident
it
was
which
probably
added
to
jane
nervous
sense
of
responsibility
she
began
to
watch
her
mistress
movements
with
anxiety
she
fell
into
the
habit
of
going
over
her
bedroom
two
or
three
times
a
day
giving
a
sort
of
examination
to
its
contents
perhaps
i
so
fond
of
her
that
it
making
me
downright
silly
she
said
to
her
mother
but
it
seems
as
if
i
ca
help
it
i
feel
as
if
i
like
to
know
everything
she
does
and
go
over
the
ground
to
make
sure
of
it
before
she
goes
anywhere
i
so
proud
of
her
mother
just
as
proud
as
if
i
was
some
connection
of
the
family
instead
of
just
her
maid
it
be
such
a
splendid
thing
if
she
keeps
well
and
everything
goes
as
it
should
even
people
like
us
can
see
what
it
means
to
a
gentleman
that
can
go
back
nine
hundred
years
if
i
was
lady
maria
bayne
i
be
here
and
never
leave
her
i
tell
you
nothing
could
drive
me
from
her
you
are
well
taken
care
of
hester
had
said
that
girl
is
devoted
to
you
in
her
lady
maid
way
she
fight
for
your
life
i
think
she
is
as
faithful
to
me
as
ameerah
is
to
you
emily
answered
i
feel
sure
ameerah
would
fight
for
you
ameerah
devotion
in
these
days
took
the
form
of
a
hatred
of
the
woman
whom
she
regarded
as
her
mistress
enemy
it
is
an
evil
thing
that
she
should
take
this
place
she
said
she
is
an
old
woman
what
right
hath
she
to
think
she
may
bear
a
son
ill
luck
will
come
of
it
she
deserves
any
ill
fortune
which
may
befall
her
sometimes
lady
walderhurst
once
said
to
osborn
i
feel
as
if
ameerah
disliked
me
she
looks
at
me
in
such
a
curious
stealthy
way
she
is
admiring
you
was
his
answer
she
thinks
you
are
something
a
little
supernatural
because
you
are
so
tall
and
have
such
a
fresh
colour
there
was
in
the
park
at
palstrey
manor
a
large
ornamental
pool
of
water
deep
and
dark
and
beautiful
because
of
the
age
and
hugeness
of
the
trees
which
closed
around
it
and
the
water
plants
which
encircled
and
floated
upon
it
white
and
yellow
flags
and
brown
velvet
rushes
grew
thick
about
its
edge
and
opened
and
shut
upon
its
surface
an
avenue
of
wonderful
limes
led
down
to
a
flight
of
mossy
steps
by
which
in
times
gone
by
people
had
descended
to
the
boat
which
rocked
idly
in
the
soft
green
gloom
there
was
an
island
on
it
on
which
roses
had
been
planted
and
left
to
run
wild
early
in
the
year
daffodils
and
other
spring
flowers
burst
up
through
the
grass
and
waved
scented
heads
lady
walderhurst
had
discovered
the
place
during
her
honeymoon
and
had
loved
it
fondly
ever
since
the
avenue
leading
to
it
was
her
favourite
walk
a
certain
seat
under
a
tree
on
the
island
her
favourite
it
is
so
still
there
she
had
said
to
the
osborns
no
one
ever
goes
there
but
myself
when
i
have
crossed
the
little
old
bridge
and
sit
down
among
the
greenness
with
my
book
or
work
i
feel
as
if
there
was
no
world
at
all
there
is
no
sound
but
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
and
the
splash
of
the
who
come
to
swim
about
they
do
seem
to
be
afraid
of
me
neither
do
the
thrushes
and
robins
they
know
i
shall
only
sit
still
and
watch
them
sometimes
they
come
quite
near
she
used
in
fact
to
take
her
and
sewing
to
the
sweet
secluded
place
and
spend
hours
of
pure
restful
bliss
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
life
became
more
lovely
day
by
day
illustration
hester
osborn
hester
did
not
like
the
pool
she
thought
it
too
lonely
and
silent
she
preferred
her
beflowered
boudoir
or
the
sunny
garden
sometimes
in
these
days
she
feared
to
follow
her
own
thoughts
she
was
being
pushed
pushed
towards
the
edge
of
her
precipice
and
it
was
only
the
working
of
nature
that
she
should
lose
her
breath
and
snatch
at
strange
things
to
stay
herself
between
herself
and
her
husband
a
sort
of
silence
had
grown
there
were
subjects
of
which
they
never
spoke
and
yet
each
knew
that
the
other
mind
was
given
up
to
thought
of
them
day
and
night
there
were
black
midnight
hours
when
hester
lying
awake
in
her
bed
knew
that
alec
lay
awake
in
his
also
she
had
heard
him
many
a
time
turn
over
with
a
caught
breath
and
a
smothered
curse
she
did
not
ask
herself
what
he
was
thinking
of
she
knew
she
knew
because
she
was
thinking
of
the
same
things
herself
of
big
fresh
kind
emily
walderhurst
lost
in
her
dreams
of
exultant
happiness
which
never
ceased
to
be
amazed
and
grateful
to
prayerfulness
of
the
broad
lands
and
great
comfortable
houses
of
all
it
implied
to
be
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
or
his
son
of
the
long
sickening
voyage
back
to
india
of
the
hopeless
muddle
of
life
in
an
bungalow
of
wretched
native
servants
at
once
servile
and
stubborn
and
given
to
lies
and
thefts
more
than
once
she
was
forced
to
turn
on
her
face
that
she
might
smother
her
frenzied
sobs
in
her
pillow
it
was
on
such
a
night
she
had
awakened
from
her
sleep
to
notice
such
stillness
in
osborn
adjoining
room
that
she
thought
him
profoundly
asleep
that
she
arose
from
her
bed
to
go
and
sit
at
her
open
window
she
had
not
been
seated
there
many
minutes
before
she
became
singularly
conscious
she
did
not
know
how
of
some
presence
near
her
among
the
bushes
in
the
garden
below
it
had
indeed
scarcely
seemed
to
be
sound
or
movement
which
had
attracted
her
attention
and
yet
it
must
have
been
one
or
both
for
she
involuntarily
turned
to
a
particular
spot
yes
something
someone
was
standing
in
a
corner
hidden
by
shrubbery
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
and
people
were
meeting
she
sat
still
and
almost
breathless
she
could
hear
nothing
and
saw
nothing
but
between
the
leafage
a
dim
gleam
of
white
only
ameerah
wore
white
after
a
few
seconds
waiting
she
began
to
think
a
strange
thing
though
she
presently
realised
that
taking
all
things
into
consideration
it
was
not
strange
at
all
she
got
up
very
noiselessly
and
stole
into
her
husband
room
he
was
not
there
the
bed
was
empty
though
he
had
slept
there
earlier
in
the
night
she
went
back
to
her
own
bed
and
got
into
it
again
in
ten
minutes
time
captain
osborn
crept
upstairs
and
returned
to
bed
also
hester
made
no
sign
and
did
not
ask
any
questions
she
knew
he
would
have
told
her
nothing
and
also
she
did
not
wish
to
hear
she
had
seen
him
speaking
to
ameerah
in
the
lane
a
few
days
before
and
now
that
he
was
meeting
her
in
the
night
she
knew
that
she
need
not
ask
herself
what
the
subject
of
their
consultation
might
be
but
she
looked
haggard
in
the
morning
lady
walderhurst
herself
did
not
look
well
for
the
last
two
or
three
nights
she
had
been
starting
from
her
sleep
again
with
that
eerie
feeling
of
being
wakened
by
someone
at
her
bedside
though
she
had
found
no
one
when
she
had
examined
the
room
on
getting
up
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
am
afraid
i
am
getting
a
little
nervous
she
had
said
to
jane
cupp
i
will
begin
to
take
valerian
though
it
is
really
very
nasty
jane
herself
had
a
somewhat
harried
expression
of
countenance
she
did
not
mention
to
her
mistress
that
for
some
days
she
had
been
faithfully
following
a
line
of
conduct
she
had
begun
to
mark
out
for
herself
she
had
obtained
a
pair
of
list
slippers
and
had
been
learning
to
go
about
softly
she
had
sat
up
late
and
risen
from
her
bed
early
though
she
had
not
been
rewarded
by
any
particularly
marked
discoveries
she
had
thought
however
that
she
observed
that
ameerah
did
not
look
at
her
as
much
as
had
been
her
habit
and
she
imagined
she
rather
avoided
her
all
she
said
to
lady
walderhurst
was
yes
my
lady
mother
thinks
a
great
deal
of
valerian
to
quiet
the
nerves
will
you
have
a
light
left
in
your
room
my
lady
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
sleep
with
a
light
her
mistress
answered
i
am
not
used
to
one
she
continued
to
sleep
disturbedly
some
nights
in
the
dark
she
was
not
aware
that
on
some
of
the
nights
jane
cupp
either
slept
or
laid
awake
in
the
room
nearest
to
her
jane
own
bedroom
was
in
another
part
of
the
house
but
in
her
quiet
goings
about
in
the
list
shoes
she
now
and
then
saw
things
which
made
her
nervously
determined
to
be
within
immediate
call
i
do
say
it
is
nerves
mother
she
said
and
that
i
ai
silly
to
feel
so
suspicious
of
all
sorts
of
little
things
but
there
nights
when
i
could
stand
it
not
to
be
quite
near
her
chapter
sixteen
the
lime
avenue
was
a
dim
if
lovely
place
at
twilight
when
the
sun
was
setting
broad
lances
of
gold
slanted
through
the
branches
and
glorified
the
green
spaces
with
mellow
depths
of
light
but
later
when
the
night
was
drawing
in
the
lines
of
grey
shadowed
and
canopied
by
boughs
suggested
to
the
mind
the
pillars
of
some
ruined
cathedral
desolate
and
ghostly
jane
cupp
facing
the
gloom
of
it
during
her
lady
and
glancing
furtively
from
side
to
side
as
she
went
would
have
been
awed
by
the
grey
stillness
even
if
she
had
not
been
in
a
timorous
mood
to
begin
with
in
the
first
place
the
lime
avenue
which
was
her
ladyship
own
special
and
favourite
walk
was
not
the
usual
promenade
of
even
the
gardeners
seldom
set
foot
in
it
unless
to
sweep
away
dead
leaves
and
fallen
wood
jane
herself
had
never
been
here
before
this
evening
she
had
gone
absolutely
because
she
was
following
ameerah
she
was
following
ameerah
because
during
the
afternoon
in
the
servants
hall
she
had
caught
a
sentence
or
so
in
the
midst
of
a
gossiping
story
which
had
made
her
feel
that
she
should
be
unhappy
if
she
did
not
go
down
the
walk
and
to
the
see
the
water
the
boat
the
steps
everything
my
word
mother
she
had
said
it
a
queer
business
for
a
respectable
girl
that
maid
in
a
great
place
to
be
feeling
as
if
she
had
to
watch
black
people
same
as
if
she
was
in
the
police
and
not
daring
to
say
a
word
for
if
i
did
say
a
word
captain
osborn
clever
enough
to
have
me
sent
away
from
here
in
a
jiffy
and
the
worst
of
it
is
twisting
her
hands
together
there
be
going
on
really
if
they
were
as
innocent
as
lambs
they
could
act
any
different
and
just
the
same
things
have
happened
by
accident
that
the
worst
of
it
was
cupp
fretted
rejoinder
any
old
piece
of
carving
might
have
dropped
out
of
a
balustrade
and
any
lady
that
was
well
might
have
nightmare
and
be
disturbed
in
her
sleep
yes
admitted
jane
anxiously
that
is
the
worst
of
it
sometimes
i
feel
so
foolish
i
all
upset
with
myself
the
gossip
in
servants
halls
embraces
many
topics
in
country
houses
there
is
naturally
much
to
be
said
of
village
incidents
of
the
scandals
of
cottages
and
the
tragedies
of
farms
this
afternoon
at
one
end
of
the
table
the
talk
had
been
of
a
cottage
scandal
which
had
verged
on
tragedy
a
handsome
bouncing
flaunting
village
girl
had
got
into
that
trouble
which
had
been
anticipated
for
her
by
both
friends
and
enemies
for
some
time
being
the
girl
she
was
much
venomous
village
social
stir
had
resulted
it
had
been
predicted
that
she
would
go
up
to
london
or
that
she
would
drown
herself
having
an
impudent
high
spirit
which
brought
upon
her
much
scornful
and
derisive
flouting
on
her
evil
day
the
manor
servants
knew
a
good
deal
of
her
because
she
had
been
for
a
while
a
servant
at
the
kennel
farm
and
had
had
a
great
fancy
for
ameerah
whom
it
had
pleased
her
to
make
friends
with
when
she
fell
suddenly
ill
and
for
days
lay
at
the
point
of
death
there
was
a
stealthy
general
opinion
that
ameerah
with
her
love
spells
and
potions
could
have
said
much
which
might
have
been
enlightening
if
she
had
chosen
the
girl
had
been
in
appalling
danger
the
village
doctor
who
had
been
hastily
called
in
had
at
one
moment
declared
that
life
had
left
her
body
it
was
in
fact
only
ameerah
who
had
insisted
that
she
was
not
dead
after
a
period
of
prostration
during
which
she
seemed
a
corpse
she
had
slowly
come
back
to
earthly
existence
the
graphic
descriptions
of
the
scenes
by
her
bedside
of
her
apparent
death
her
cold
and
bloodless
body
her
lagging
and
ghastly
revival
to
consciousness
aroused
in
the
servants
hall
a
fevered
interest
ameerah
was
asked
questions
and
gave
such
answers
as
satisfied
herself
if
not
her
interlocutors
she
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
opinions
of
her
fellow
servitors
she
knew
all
about
them
while
they
knew
nothing
whatsoever
about
her
her
limited
english
could
be
used
as
a
means
of
baffling
them
she
smiled
and
fell
into
hindustani
when
she
was
pressed
jane
cupp
heard
both
questions
and
answers
ameerah
professed
to
know
nothing
but
such
things
as
the
whole
village
knew
towards
the
end
of
the
discussion
however
in
a
mixture
of
broken
english
and
hindustani
she
conveyed
that
she
had
believed
that
the
girl
would
drown
herself
asked
why
she
shook
her
head
then
said
that
she
had
seen
her
by
the
mem
sahib
lake
at
the
end
of
the
trees
she
had
asked
if
the
water
was
deep
enough
near
the
bridge
to
drown
ameerah
had
answered
that
she
did
not
know
there
was
a
general
exclamation
they
all
knew
it
was
deep
there
the
women
shuddered
as
they
remembered
how
deep
they
had
been
told
it
was
at
that
particular
spot
it
was
said
that
there
was
no
bottom
to
it
everybody
rather
revelled
in
the
gruesomeness
of
the
idea
of
a
bottomless
piece
of
water
someone
remembered
that
there
was
a
story
about
it
as
much
as
ninety
years
ago
two
young
labourers
on
the
place
had
quarrelled
about
a
young
woman
one
day
in
the
heat
of
jealous
rage
one
had
seized
the
other
and
literally
thrown
him
into
the
pond
he
had
never
been
found
no
drags
could
reach
his
body
he
had
sunk
into
the
blackness
for
ever
ameerah
sat
at
the
table
with
downcast
eyes
she
had
a
habit
of
sitting
silent
with
dropped
eyes
which
jane
could
not
bear
as
she
drank
her
tea
she
watched
her
in
spite
of
herself
after
a
few
minutes
had
passed
her
appetite
for
bread
and
butter
deserted
her
she
got
up
and
left
the
hall
looking
pale
the
mental
phases
through
which
she
went
during
the
afternoon
ended
in
her
determination
to
go
down
the
avenue
and
to
the
water
side
this
evening
it
could
be
done
while
her
ladyship
and
her
guests
were
at
dinner
this
evening
the
vicar
and
his
wife
and
daughter
were
dining
at
the
manor
jane
took
in
emotionally
all
the
mysterious
silence
and
dimness
of
the
long
aisle
and
felt
a
tremor
as
she
walked
down
it
trying
to
hold
herself
in
hand
by
practical
reflections
half
whispered
i
just
going
to
have
a
look
to
make
sure
she
said
silly
or
not
i
got
upset
through
not
being
able
to
help
watching
that
woman
and
the
way
to
steady
my
nerves
is
to
make
sure
i
just
giving
in
to
foolishness
she
walked
as
fast
as
she
could
towards
the
water
she
could
see
its
gleam
in
the
dim
light
but
she
must
pass
a
certain
tree
before
she
could
see
the
little
bridge
itself
my
goodness
what
that
she
said
suddenly
it
was
something
white
which
rose
up
as
if
from
the
ground
as
if
from
the
rushes
growing
at
the
water
edge
just
a
second
jane
stood
and
choked
and
then
suddenly
darted
forward
running
as
fast
as
she
could
the
white
figure
merely
moved
slowly
away
among
the
trees
it
did
not
run
or
seem
startled
and
as
jane
ran
she
caught
it
by
its
white
drapery
and
found
herself
as
she
had
known
she
would
dragging
at
the
garments
of
ameerah
but
ameerah
only
turned
round
and
greeted
her
with
a
welcoming
smile
mild
enough
to
damp
any
excitement
what
are
you
doing
here
jane
demanded
why
do
you
come
to
this
place
ameerah
answered
her
with
simple
fluency
in
hindustani
with
her
manner
of
not
realising
that
she
was
speaking
to
a
foreigner
who
could
not
understand
her
what
she
explained
was
that
having
heard
that
mem
sahib
came
here
to
meditate
on
account
of
the
stillness
she
herself
had
formed
the
habit
of
coming
to
indulge
in
prayer
and
meditation
when
the
place
was
deserted
for
the
day
she
commended
the
place
to
jane
and
to
jane
mother
whom
she
believed
to
be
holy
persons
given
to
devotional
exercises
jane
shook
her
i
do
understand
a
word
you
say
she
cried
you
know
i
do
speak
in
english
ameerah
shook
her
head
slowly
and
smiled
again
with
patience
she
endeavoured
to
explain
in
english
which
jane
was
sure
was
worse
than
she
had
ever
heard
her
use
before
was
it
forbidden
that
a
servant
should
come
to
the
water
she
was
far
too
much
for
jane
who
was
so
unnerved
that
she
burst
into
tears
you
are
up
to
some
wickedness
she
sobbed
i
know
you
are
past
bearing
i
going
to
write
to
people
that
got
the
right
to
do
what
i
dare
i
going
back
to
that
bridge
ameerah
looked
at
her
with
a
puzzled
amiability
for
a
few
seconds
she
entered
into
further
apologies
and
explanations
in
hindustani
in
the
midst
of
them
her
narrow
eyes
faintly
gleamed
and
she
raised
a
hand
they
come
to
us
it
is
your
mem
sahib
and
her
people
hear
them
she
spoke
truly
jane
had
miscalculated
as
to
her
hour
or
the
time
spent
at
the
had
been
shorter
than
usual
in
fact
lady
walderhurst
had
brought
her
guests
to
see
the
young
moon
peer
through
the
as
she
sometimes
did
when
the
evening
was
warm
jane
cupp
fled
precipitately
ameerah
disappeared
also
but
without
precipitation
or
any
sign
of
embarrassment
you
look
as
if
you
had
not
slept
well
jane
lady
walderhurst
remarked
in
the
morning
as
her
hair
was
being
brushed
she
had
glanced
into
the
glass
and
saw
that
it
reflected
a
pale
face
above
her
own
and
that
the
pale
face
had
red
rims
to
its
eyes
i
have
been
a
bit
troubled
by
a
headache
my
lady
jane
answered
i
have
something
like
a
headache
myself
lady
walderhurst
voice
had
not
its
usual
cheerful
ring
her
own
eyes
looked
heavy
i
did
not
rest
well
i
have
not
rested
well
for
a
week
that
habit
of
starting
from
my
sleep
feeling
that
some
sound
has
disturbed
me
is
growing
on
me
last
night
i
dreamed
again
that
someone
touched
my
side
i
think
i
shall
be
obliged
to
send
for
sir
samuel
brent
my
lady
exclaimed
jane
feverishly
if
you
would
if
you
would
lady
walderhurst
look
at
her
was
nervous
and
disturbed
do
you
does
your
mother
think
i
am
not
as
well
as
i
should
be
jane
she
said
jane
hands
were
actually
trembling
oh
no
my
lady
oh
no
but
if
sir
samuel
could
be
sent
for
or
lady
maria
bayne
or
or
his
lordship
the
disturbed
expression
of
lady
walderhurst
face
changed
to
something
verging
on
alarm
it
was
true
that
she
began
to
be
horribly
frightened
she
turned
upon
jane
pallor
creeping
over
her
skin
oh
she
cried
a
sound
of
almost
fear
and
entreaty
in
her
voice
i
am
sure
you
think
i
am
ill
i
am
sure
you
do
what
what
is
it
she
leaned
forward
suddenly
and
rested
her
forehead
on
her
hands
her
elbows
supported
by
the
she
was
overcome
by
a
shock
of
dread
oh
if
anything
should
go
wrong
in
a
faint
half
wail
if
anything
happen
she
could
not
bear
the
mere
thought
it
would
break
her
heart
she
had
been
so
happy
god
had
been
so
good
jane
was
inwardly
convulsed
with
contrition
commingled
with
anger
at
her
own
blundering
folly
now
it
was
she
herself
who
had
upset
her
ladyship
given
her
a
fright
that
made
her
pale
and
trembling
what
did
she
not
deserve
for
being
such
a
thoughtless
fool
she
might
have
known
she
poured
forth
respectfully
affectionate
protestations
indeed
i
beg
your
pardon
my
lady
indeed
it
only
my
silliness
mother
was
saying
yesterday
that
she
had
never
seen
a
lady
so
well
and
in
as
good
spirits
i
have
no
right
to
be
here
if
i
make
such
mistakes
please
my
lady
oh
might
mother
be
allowed
to
step
in
a
minute
to
speak
to
you
emily
colour
came
back
gradually
when
jane
went
to
her
mother
cupp
almost
boxed
her
ears
that
just
the
way
with
girls
she
said
no
more
sense
than
a
pack
of
cats
if
you
ca
keep
quiet
you
better
just
give
up
of
course
she
think
you
meant
they
was
to
be
sent
for
because
we
was
certain
she
was
a
dying
woman
oh
my
jane
cupp
get
away
she
enjoyed
her
little
interview
with
lady
walderhurst
greatly
a
woman
whose
opinion
was
of
value
at
such
a
time
had
the
soundest
reasons
for
enjoying
herself
when
she
returned
to
her
room
she
sat
and
fanned
herself
with
a
pocket
handkerchief
and
dealt
judicially
with
jane
what
we
got
to
do
she
said
is
to
think
and
think
we
will
tell
her
things
outright
we
must
not
until
we
got
something
sure
and
proved
then
we
can
call
on
them
that
got
the
power
in
their
hands
we
ca
call
on
them
till
we
can
show
them
a
thing
no
one
ca
deny
as
to
that
bridge
it
old
enough
to
be
easy
managed
and
look
accidental
if
it
broke
you
say
she
ai
going
there
well
this
very
night
as
soon
as
it
dark
enough
you
and
me
will
go
down
and
have
a
look
at
it
and
what
more
we
take
a
man
with
us
judd
could
be
trusted
worst
comes
to
worst
we
only
taking
the
liberty
of
making
sure
it
safe
because
we
know
it
old
and
we
over
careful
as
jane
had
gathered
from
her
by
careful
and
apparently
incidental
inquiry
emily
had
had
no
intention
of
visiting
her
retreat
in
the
morning
she
had
in
fact
not
felt
quite
well
enough
her
nightmare
had
shaken
her
far
more
on
its
second
occurring
the
stealthy
hand
had
seemed
not
merely
to
touch
but
to
grip
at
her
side
and
she
had
been
physically
unable
to
rise
for
some
minutes
after
her
awakening
this
experience
had
its
physical
and
mental
effects
on
her
she
did
not
see
hester
until
luncheon
and
after
luncheon
she
found
her
to
be
in
one
of
her
strange
humours
she
was
often
in
these
strange
humours
at
this
time
she
wore
a
nervous
and
strained
look
and
frequently
seemed
to
have
been
crying
she
had
new
lines
on
her
forehead
between
the
eyebrows
emily
had
tried
in
vain
to
rouse
and
cheer
her
with
sympathetic
feminine
talk
there
were
days
when
she
felt
that
for
some
reason
hester
did
not
care
to
see
her
she
felt
it
this
afternoon
and
not
being
herself
at
the
mark
of
cheerfulness
she
was
conscious
of
a
certain
degree
of
discouragement
she
had
liked
her
so
much
she
had
wanted
to
be
friends
with
her
and
to
make
her
life
an
easier
thing
and
yet
she
appeared
somehow
to
have
failed
it
was
because
she
was
so
far
from
being
a
clever
woman
perhaps
she
might
fail
in
other
things
because
she
was
not
clever
perhaps
she
was
never
able
to
give
to
people
what
they
wanted
what
they
needed
a
brilliant
woman
had
such
power
to
gain
and
hold
love
after
an
hour
or
so
spent
in
trying
to
raise
the
mental
temperature
of
osborn
beflowered
boudoir
she
rose
and
picked
up
her
little
perhaps
you
would
take
a
nap
if
i
left
you
she
said
i
think
i
will
stroll
down
to
the
lake
she
quietly
stole
away
leaving
hester
on
her
cushions
chapter
seventeen
a
few
minutes
later
a
knock
at
the
door
being
replied
to
by
curt
come
in
produced
the
modest
entry
of
jane
cupp
who
had
come
to
make
a
necessary
inquiry
of
her
mistress
her
ladyship
is
not
here
she
has
gone
out
jane
made
an
altogether
involuntary
step
forward
her
face
became
the
colour
of
her
clean
white
apron
out
she
gasped
hester
turned
sharply
round
to
the
lake
she
said
what
do
you
mean
by
staring
in
that
way
jane
did
not
tell
her
what
she
meant
she
incontinently
ran
from
the
room
without
any
shadow
of
a
pretence
at
a
lady
maid
decorum
she
fled
through
the
rooms
to
make
a
short
cut
to
the
door
opening
on
to
the
gardens
through
that
she
darted
and
flew
across
paths
and
flowerbeds
towards
the
avenue
of
limes
she
sha
get
to
the
bridge
before
me
she
panted
she
sha
she
sha
i
wo
let
her
oh
if
my
breath
will
only
hold
out
she
did
not
reflect
that
gardeners
would
naturally
think
she
had
gone
mad
she
thought
of
nothing
whatever
but
the
look
in
ameerah
downcast
eyes
when
the
servants
had
talked
of
the
bottomless
water
the
eerie
satisfied
sly
look
of
that
and
of
the
rising
of
the
white
figure
from
the
ground
last
night
she
thought
and
she
clutched
her
neat
side
as
she
ran
the
lime
avenue
seemed
a
mile
long
and
yet
when
she
was
running
down
it
she
saw
lady
walderhurst
walking
slowly
under
the
trees
carrying
her
touching
little
basket
of
sewing
in
her
hand
she
was
close
to
the
bridge
my
lady
my
lady
she
gasped
out
as
soon
as
she
dared
she
could
not
run
screaming
all
the
way
oh
my
lady
if
you
please
emily
heard
her
and
turned
round
never
had
she
been
much
more
amazed
in
her
life
her
maid
her
jane
cupp
who
had
not
drawn
an
indecorous
breath
since
assuming
her
duties
was
running
after
her
calling
out
to
her
waving
her
hands
her
face
distorted
her
voice
hysteric
emily
had
been
just
on
the
point
of
stepping
on
to
the
bridge
her
hand
had
been
outstretched
towards
the
rail
she
drew
back
a
step
in
alarm
and
stood
staring
how
strange
everything
seemed
she
began
to
feel
choked
and
trembling
a
few
seconds
and
jane
was
upon
her
clutching
at
her
dress
she
had
so
lost
her
breath
that
she
was
almost
speechless
my
lady
she
panted
do
set
foot
on
it
do
do
till
sure
on
on
what
then
jane
realised
how
mad
she
looked
how
insane
the
whole
scene
was
and
she
gave
way
to
her
emotions
partly
through
physical
exhaustion
and
breathlessness
and
partly
through
helpless
terror
she
fell
on
her
knees
the
bridge
she
said
i
do
care
what
happens
to
me
so
that
no
harm
comes
to
you
there
things
being
plotted
and
planned
that
looks
like
accidents
the
bridge
would
look
like
an
accident
if
part
of
it
broke
there
no
bottom
to
the
water
they
were
saying
so
yesterday
and
sat
listening
i
found
her
here
last
night
she
her
emily
felt
as
if
she
was
passing
through
another
nightmare
ameerah
wailed
poor
jane
white
ones
have
no
chance
against
black
oh
my
lady
her
sense
of
the
possibility
that
she
might
be
making
a
fool
of
herself
after
all
was
nearly
killing
her
i
believe
she
would
drive
you
to
your
death
if
she
could
do
it
think
what
you
will
of
me
the
little
basket
of
needlework
shook
in
lady
walderhurst
hand
she
swallowed
hard
and
without
warning
sat
down
on
the
roots
of
a
fallen
tree
her
cheeks
blanching
slowly
oh
jane
she
said
in
simple
woe
and
bewilderment
i
do
understand
any
of
it
how
could
how
they
want
to
hurt
me
her
innocence
was
so
fatuous
that
she
thought
that
because
she
had
been
kind
to
them
they
could
not
hate
or
wish
to
injure
her
but
something
for
the
first
time
made
her
begin
to
quail
she
sat
and
tried
to
recover
herself
she
put
out
a
shaking
hand
to
the
basket
of
sewing
she
could
scarcely
see
it
because
suddenly
tears
had
filled
her
eyes
bring
one
of
the
men
here
she
said
after
a
few
moments
tell
him
that
i
am
a
little
uncertain
about
the
safety
of
the
bridge
she
sat
quite
still
while
jane
was
absent
in
search
of
the
man
she
held
her
basket
on
her
knee
her
hand
resting
on
it
her
kindly
mind
was
wakening
to
strange
thoughts
to
her
they
seemed
inhuman
and
uncanny
was
it
because
good
faithful
ignorant
jane
had
been
rather
nervous
about
ameerah
that
she
herself
had
of
late
got
into
a
habit
of
feeling
as
if
the
ayah
was
watching
and
following
her
she
had
been
startled
more
than
once
by
finding
her
near
when
she
had
not
been
aware
of
her
presence
she
had
of
course
heard
hester
say
that
native
servants
often
startled
one
by
their
silent
ways
but
the
woman
eyes
had
frightened
her
and
she
had
heard
the
story
about
the
village
girl
she
sat
and
thought
and
thought
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
ground
and
her
breath
came
quickly
and
irregularly
several
times
i
do
know
what
to
do
she
said
i
am
sure
if
it
is
true
i
know
what
to
do
the
heavy
step
and
jane
lighter
one
roused
her
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
watch
the
pair
as
they
came
he
was
a
big
young
man
with
a
simple
rustic
face
and
big
shoulders
and
hands
the
bridge
is
so
slight
and
old
she
said
to
him
that
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
not
be
quite
safe
examine
it
carefully
to
make
sure
the
young
man
touched
his
forehead
and
began
to
look
the
supports
over
jane
watched
him
with
bated
breath
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
they
all
right
on
this
side
my
lady
he
said
i
shall
have
to
get
in
the
boat
to
make
sure
of
them
that
rest
on
the
island
he
stamped
upon
the
end
nearest
and
it
remained
firm
look
at
the
railing
well
said
lady
walderhurst
i
often
stand
and
lean
on
it
and
and
watch
the
sunset
she
faltered
at
this
point
because
she
had
suddenly
remembered
that
this
was
a
habit
of
hers
and
that
she
had
often
spoken
of
it
to
the
osborns
there
was
a
point
on
the
bridge
at
which
through
a
gap
in
the
trees
a
beautiful
sunset
was
always
particularly
beautiful
it
was
the
rail
facing
these
special
trees
she
rested
on
when
she
watched
the
evening
sky
the
big
young
gardener
looked
at
the
rail
and
shook
it
with
his
strong
hands
that
safe
enough
he
said
to
jane
try
the
other
said
jane
he
tried
the
other
something
had
happened
to
it
it
broke
in
his
big
grasp
his
sunburnt
skin
changed
colour
by
at
least
three
shades
lord
jane
heard
him
gasp
under
his
breath
he
touched
his
cap
and
looked
blankly
at
lady
walderhurst
jane
heart
seemed
to
herself
to
roll
over
she
scarcely
dared
look
at
her
mistress
but
when
she
took
courage
to
do
so
she
found
her
so
white
that
she
hurried
to
her
side
thank
you
jane
she
said
rather
faintly
the
sky
is
so
lovely
this
afternoon
that
i
meant
to
stop
and
look
at
it
i
should
have
fallen
into
the
water
which
they
say
has
no
bottom
no
one
would
have
seen
or
heard
me
if
you
had
not
come
she
caught
jane
hand
and
held
it
hard
her
eyes
wandered
over
the
avenue
of
big
trees
which
no
one
but
herself
came
near
at
this
hour
it
would
have
been
so
lonely
so
lonely
the
gardener
went
away
still
looking
less
ruddy
than
he
had
looked
when
he
arrived
on
the
spot
lady
walderhurst
rose
from
her
seat
on
the
mossy
she
rose
quite
slowly
do
speak
to
me
yet
jane
she
said
and
with
jane
following
her
at
a
respectful
distance
she
returned
to
the
house
and
went
to
her
room
to
lie
down
there
was
nothing
to
prove
that
the
whole
thing
was
not
mere
chance
mere
chance
it
was
this
which
turned
her
cold
it
was
all
impossible
the
little
bridge
had
been
entirely
unused
for
so
long
a
time
it
had
been
so
slight
a
structure
from
the
first
it
was
old
and
she
remembered
now
that
walderhurst
had
once
said
that
it
must
be
examined
and
strengthened
if
it
was
to
be
used
she
had
leaned
upon
the
rail
often
lately
one
evening
she
had
wondered
if
it
seemed
quite
as
steady
as
usual
what
could
she
say
whom
could
she
accuse
because
a
piece
of
rotten
wood
had
given
away
she
started
on
her
pillow
it
was
a
piece
of
rotten
wood
which
had
fallen
from
the
balustrade
upon
the
stairs
to
be
seen
and
picked
up
by
jane
just
before
she
would
have
passed
down
on
her
way
to
dinner
and
yet
what
would
she
appear
to
her
husband
to
lady
maria
to
anyone
in
the
decorous
world
if
she
told
them
that
she
believed
that
in
a
dignified
english
household
an
english
gentleman
even
a
deposed
heir
presumptive
was
working
out
a
subtle
plot
against
her
such
as
might
adorn
a
melodrama
she
held
her
head
in
her
hands
as
her
mind
depicted
to
her
lord
walderhurst
countenance
lady
maria
dubious
amused
smile
she
would
think
i
was
hysterical
she
cried
under
her
breath
he
would
think
i
was
vulgar
and
stupid
that
i
was
a
fussy
woman
with
foolish
ideas
which
made
him
ridiculous
captain
osborn
is
of
his
family
i
should
be
accusing
him
of
being
a
criminal
and
yet
i
might
have
been
in
the
bottomless
pond
in
the
bottomless
pond
and
no
one
would
have
known
if
it
all
had
not
seemed
so
incredible
to
her
if
she
could
have
felt
certain
herself
she
would
not
have
been
overwhelmed
with
this
sense
of
being
baffled
bewildered
lost
the
ayah
who
so
loved
hester
might
hate
her
rival
a
jealous
native
woman
might
be
capable
of
playing
stealthy
tricks
which
to
her
strange
mind
might
seem
to
serve
a
proper
end
captain
osborn
might
not
know
she
breathed
again
as
this
thought
came
to
her
he
could
not
know
it
would
be
too
insane
too
dangerous
too
wicked
and
yet
if
she
had
been
flung
headlong
down
the
staircase
if
the
fall
had
killed
her
where
would
have
been
the
danger
for
the
man
who
would
only
have
deplored
a
fatal
accident
if
she
had
leaned
upon
the
rail
and
fallen
into
the
black
depths
of
water
below
what
could
have
been
blamed
but
a
piece
of
rotten
wood
she
touched
her
forehead
with
her
handkerchief
because
it
felt
cold
and
damp
there
was
no
way
out
her
teeth
chattered
they
may
be
as
innocent
as
i
am
and
they
may
be
murderers
in
their
hearts
i
can
prove
nothing
i
can
prevent
nothing
oh
come
home
there
was
but
one
thought
which
remained
clear
in
her
mind
she
must
keep
herself
safe
she
must
keep
herself
safe
in
the
anguish
of
her
trouble
she
confessed
by
putting
it
into
words
a
thing
which
she
had
not
confessed
before
and
even
as
she
spoke
she
did
not
realise
that
her
words
contained
confession
if
i
were
to
die
now
she
said
with
a
touching
gravity
he
would
care
very
much
a
few
moments
later
she
said
it
does
not
matter
what
happens
to
me
how
ridiculous
or
vulgar
or
foolish
i
seem
if
i
can
keep
myself
safe
until
after
i
will
write
to
him
now
and
ask
him
to
try
to
come
back
it
was
the
letter
she
wrote
after
this
decision
which
osborn
saw
among
others
awaiting
postal
and
which
he
stopped
to
examine
chapter
eighteen
hester
sat
at
the
open
window
of
her
boudoir
in
the
dark
she
had
herself
put
out
the
wax
candles
because
she
wanted
to
feel
herself
surrounded
by
the
soft
blackness
she
had
sat
through
the
dinner
and
heard
her
husband
anxious
inquiries
about
the
rotten
handrail
and
had
watched
his
disturbed
face
and
emily
pale
one
she
herself
had
said
but
little
and
had
been
glad
when
the
time
came
that
she
could
decently
excuse
herself
and
come
away
as
she
sat
in
the
darkness
and
felt
the
night
breath
of
the
flowers
in
the
garden
she
was
thinking
of
all
the
murderers
she
had
ever
heard
of
she
was
reflecting
that
some
of
them
had
been
quite
respectable
people
and
that
all
of
them
must
have
lived
through
a
period
in
which
they
gradually
changed
from
respectable
people
to
persons
in
whose
brains
a
thought
had
worked
which
once
they
would
have
believed
impossible
to
them
which
they
might
have
scouted
the
idea
of
their
giving
room
to
she
was
sure
the
change
must
come
about
slowly
at
first
it
would
seem
too
mad
and
ridiculous
a
sort
of
angry
joke
then
the
angry
joke
would
return
again
and
again
until
at
last
they
let
it
stay
and
did
not
laugh
at
it
but
thought
it
over
such
things
always
happened
because
some
one
wanted
or
did
not
want
something
very
much
something
it
drove
them
mad
to
think
of
being
forced
to
live
without
or
with
men
who
hated
a
woman
and
could
not
rid
themselves
of
her
who
hated
the
sight
of
her
face
her
eyes
her
hair
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
step
and
were
rendered
insane
by
her
nearness
and
the
thought
that
they
never
could
be
free
from
any
of
these
things
had
before
now
commonplace
or
comparatively
agreeable
men
by
degrees
reached
the
point
where
a
knife
or
a
shot
or
a
heavy
blow
seemed
not
only
possible
but
inevitable
people
who
had
been
people
who
had
faced
horrors
through
want
and
desire
had
reached
the
moment
in
which
they
took
by
force
what
fate
would
not
grant
them
her
brain
so
whirled
that
she
wondered
if
she
was
not
a
little
delirious
as
she
sat
in
the
stillness
thinking
such
strange
things
for
weeks
she
had
been
living
under
a
strain
so
intense
that
her
feelings
had
seemed
to
cease
to
have
any
connection
with
what
was
normal
she
had
known
too
much
and
yet
she
had
been
certain
of
nothing
at
all
but
she
and
alec
were
like
the
people
who
began
with
a
bad
joke
and
then
were
driven
and
driven
it
was
impossible
not
to
think
of
what
might
come
and
of
what
might
be
lost
for
ever
if
the
rail
had
not
been
tried
this
afternoon
if
big
foolish
emily
walderhurst
had
been
lying
peacefully
among
the
weeds
the
end
comes
to
everyone
she
said
it
would
have
been
all
over
in
a
few
minutes
they
say
it
is
really
painful
her
lips
quivered
and
she
pressed
her
hands
tightly
between
her
knees
that
a
murderer
thought
she
muttered
querulously
and
yet
i
was
a
bad
girl
to
begin
with
she
began
to
see
things
the
chief
thing
was
a
sort
of
vision
of
how
emily
would
have
looked
lying
in
the
depths
of
the
water
among
the
weeds
her
brown
hair
would
have
broken
loose
and
perhaps
tangled
itself
over
her
white
face
would
her
eyes
be
open
and
glazed
or
half
shut
and
her
childish
smile
the
smile
that
looked
so
odd
on
the
face
of
a
woman
would
it
have
been
fixed
and
seemed
to
confront
the
world
of
life
with
a
meek
question
as
to
what
she
had
done
to
people
why
she
had
been
drowned
hester
felt
sure
that
was
what
her
helpless
stillness
would
have
expressed
how
happy
the
woman
had
been
to
see
her
go
about
with
her
unconsciously
joyous
eyes
had
sometimes
been
maddening
and
yet
poor
thing
why
had
she
not
the
right
to
be
happy
she
was
always
trying
to
please
people
and
help
them
she
was
so
good
that
she
was
almost
silly
the
day
she
had
brought
the
little
things
from
london
to
the
kennel
farm
hester
remembered
that
despite
her
own
morbid
resentment
she
had
ended
by
kissing
her
with
repentant
tears
she
heard
again
in
the
midst
of
her
delirious
thoughts
the
nice
prosaic
emotion
of
her
voice
as
she
said
thank
me
do
just
let
us
ourselves
and
she
might
have
been
lying
among
the
long
thick
weeds
of
the
pond
and
it
would
not
have
been
the
accident
it
would
have
appeared
to
be
of
that
she
felt
sure
brought
face
to
face
with
this
definiteness
of
situation
she
began
to
shudder
she
went
out
into
the
night
feeling
that
she
wanted
air
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
stand
the
realisation
that
she
had
become
part
of
a
web
into
which
she
had
not
meant
to
be
knitted
no
she
had
had
her
passionate
and
desperate
moments
but
she
had
not
meant
things
like
this
she
had
almost
hoped
that
disaster
might
befall
she
had
almost
thought
it
possible
that
she
would
do
nothing
to
prevent
it
almost
but
some
things
were
too
bad
she
felt
small
and
young
and
hopelessly
evil
as
she
walked
in
the
dark
along
a
grass
path
to
a
seat
under
a
tree
the
very
stillness
of
the
night
was
a
horror
to
her
especially
when
once
an
owl
called
and
again
a
dreaming
bird
cried
in
its
nest
she
sat
under
the
tree
in
the
dark
for
at
least
an
hour
the
thick
shadow
of
the
drooping
branches
hid
her
in
actual
blackness
and
seclusion
she
said
to
herself
later
that
some
one
of
the
occult
powers
she
believed
in
had
made
her
go
out
and
sit
in
this
particular
spot
because
there
was
a
thing
which
was
not
to
be
and
she
herself
must
come
between
when
she
at
last
rose
it
was
with
panting
breath
she
stole
back
to
her
room
and
lighted
with
an
unsteady
hand
a
bedroom
candle
whose
flame
flickered
upon
a
distorted
little
dark
face
for
as
she
had
sat
under
the
tree
she
had
after
a
while
heard
whispering
begin
quite
near
her
had
caught
even
in
the
darkness
a
gleam
of
white
and
had
therefore
deliberately
sat
and
listened
there
could
be
to
the
purely
normal
geniality
of
emily
nature
no
greater
relief
than
the
recognition
that
a
cloud
had
passed
from
the
mood
of
another
when
hester
appeared
the
next
morning
at
the
she
had
emerged
from
her
humour
of
the
day
before
and
was
almost
affectionate
in
her
amiability
the
meal
at
an
end
she
walked
with
emily
in
the
garden
she
had
never
shown
such
interest
in
what
pertained
to
her
as
she
revealed
this
morning
something
she
had
always
before
lacked
emily
recognised
in
her
for
the
first
time
a
desire
to
ask
friendly
questions
to
verge
on
the
confidential
they
talked
long
and
without
reserve
and
how
pretty
it
was
of
the
girl
emily
thought
to
care
so
much
about
her
health
and
her
spirits
to
be
so
interested
in
the
details
of
her
life
even
in
the
simple
matter
of
the
preparation
and
serving
of
her
food
as
if
the
merest
trifle
was
of
consequence
it
had
been
unfair
too
to
fancy
that
she
felt
no
interest
in
walderhurst
absence
and
return
she
had
noticed
everything
closely
and
actually
thought
he
ought
to
come
back
at
once
send
for
him
she
said
quite
suddenly
send
for
him
now
there
was
an
eagerness
expressed
in
the
dark
thinness
of
her
face
which
moved
emily
it
is
dear
of
you
to
care
so
much
hester
she
said
i
did
know
you
thought
it
mattered
he
must
come
said
hester
that
all
send
for
him
i
wrote
a
letter
yesterday
was
lady
walderhurst
meek
rejoinder
i
got
nervous
so
did
i
get
nervous
said
hester
so
did
i
that
she
was
disturbed
emily
could
see
the
little
laugh
she
ended
her
words
with
had
an
excited
ring
in
it
during
the
osborns
stay
at
palstrey
the
two
women
had
naturally
seen
a
good
deal
of
each
other
but
for
the
next
two
days
they
were
scarcely
separated
at
all
emily
feeling
merely
cheered
and
supported
by
the
fact
that
hester
made
herself
so
excellent
a
companion
was
not
aware
of
two
or
three
things
one
was
that
osborn
did
not
lose
sight
of
her
unless
at
such
times
as
she
was
in
the
hands
of
jane
cupp
i
may
as
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
the
young
woman
said
i
have
a
sense
of
responsibility
about
you
that
i
have
liked
to
speak
of
before
it
half
hysterical
i
suppose
but
it
has
got
the
better
of
me
you
feel
responsible
for
exclaimed
emily
with
wondering
eyes
yes
i
do
she
almost
snapped
you
represent
so
much
walderhurst
ought
to
be
here
i
not
fit
to
take
care
of
you
i
ought
to
be
taking
care
of
you
said
emily
with
gentle
gravity
i
am
the
older
and
stronger
you
are
not
nearly
so
well
as
i
am
hester
startled
her
by
bursting
into
tears
then
do
as
i
tell
you
she
said
do
go
anywhere
alone
take
jane
cupp
with
you
you
have
nearly
had
two
accidents
make
jane
sleep
in
your
emily
felt
a
dreary
chill
creep
over
her
that
which
she
had
felt
in
the
air
when
she
had
slowly
turned
an
amazed
face
upon
jane
in
the
lime
avenue
that
sense
of
the
strangeness
of
things
again
closed
her
in
i
will
do
as
you
wish
she
answered
but
before
the
next
day
closed
all
was
made
plain
to
her
all
the
awfulness
all
the
cruel
inhuman
truth
of
things
which
seemed
to
lose
their
possibility
in
the
exaggeration
of
proportion
which
made
their
incongruousness
almost
grotesque
the
very
prettiness
of
the
flowered
boudoir
the
very
softness
of
the
peace
in
the
velvet
spread
of
garden
before
the
windows
made
it
even
more
unreal
that
day
the
second
one
emily
had
begun
to
note
the
new
thing
hester
was
watching
her
hester
was
keeping
guard
and
as
she
realised
this
the
sense
of
the
abnormalness
of
things
grew
and
fear
grew
with
it
she
began
to
feel
as
if
a
wall
were
rising
around
her
built
by
unseen
hands
the
afternoon
an
afternoon
of
deeply
golden
sun
they
had
spent
together
they
had
read
and
talked
hester
had
said
most
she
had
told
stories
of
india
curious
vivid
interesting
stories
which
seemed
to
excite
her
at
the
time
when
the
sunlight
took
its
deepest
gold
the
was
brought
in
hester
had
left
the
room
a
short
time
before
the
footman
appeared
with
it
carrying
it
with
the
air
of
disproportionate
solemnity
with
which
certain
male
domestics
are
able
to
surround
the
smallest
service
the
tea
had
been
frequently
served
in
hester
boudoir
of
late
during
the
last
week
however
lady
walderhurst
share
of
the
meal
had
been
a
glass
of
milk
she
had
chosen
to
take
it
because
cupp
had
suggested
that
tea
was
nervous
emily
sat
down
at
the
table
and
filled
a
cup
for
hester
she
knew
she
would
return
in
a
few
moments
so
set
the
cup
before
osborn
place
and
waited
she
heard
the
young
footsteps
outside
and
as
the
door
opened
she
lifted
the
glass
of
milk
to
her
lips
she
was
afterwards
absolutely
unable
to
describe
to
herself
clearly
what
happened
the
next
moment
in
fact
it
was
the
next
moment
that
she
saw
hester
spring
towards
her
and
the
glass
of
milk
had
been
knocked
from
her
hand
and
rolled
emptying
itself
upon
the
floor
osborn
stood
before
her
clenching
and
unclenching
her
hands
have
you
drunk
any
of
it
she
demanded
no
emily
answered
i
have
not
hester
osborn
dropped
into
a
chair
and
leaned
forward
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
looked
like
a
woman
on
the
verge
of
an
outbreak
of
hysteria
only
to
be
held
in
check
by
a
frenzied
effort
lady
walderhurst
quite
slowly
turned
the
colour
of
the
milk
itself
but
she
did
nothing
but
sit
still
and
gaze
at
hester
wait
a
minute
the
girl
was
trying
to
recover
her
breath
wait
till
i
can
hold
myself
still
i
am
going
to
tell
you
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
yes
emily
answered
faintly
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
waited
twenty
minutes
before
another
word
was
spoken
that
she
sat
quite
that
long
looking
at
the
thin
hands
which
seemed
to
clutch
the
hidden
face
this
was
a
mistake
arising
from
the
intensity
of
the
strain
upon
her
nerves
it
was
scarcely
five
minutes
before
osborn
lowered
her
hands
and
laid
them
pressed
tightly
palm
to
palm
between
her
knees
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
such
a
voice
as
a
listener
outside
could
not
have
heard
do
you
know
she
demanded
what
you
represent
to
us
to
me
and
to
my
husband
as
you
sit
there
emily
shook
her
head
the
movement
of
disclaimer
was
easier
than
speech
she
felt
a
sort
of
exhaustion
i
do
believe
you
do
said
hester
you
do
seem
to
realise
anything
perhaps
it
because
you
are
so
innocent
perhaps
it
because
you
are
so
foolish
you
represent
the
thing
that
we
have
the
right
to
most
on
earth
do
hate
me
asked
emily
trying
to
adjust
herself
mentally
to
the
mad
extraordinariness
of
the
situation
and
at
the
same
time
scarcely
understanding
why
she
asked
her
question
sometimes
i
do
when
i
do
not
i
wonder
at
myself
the
girl
paused
a
second
looked
down
as
if
questioningly
at
the
carpet
and
then
lifting
her
eyes
again
went
on
in
a
dragging
half
bewildered
voice
when
i
do
i
actually
believe
it
is
because
we
are
both
women
together
before
it
was
different
the
look
which
walderhurst
had
compared
to
that
of
some
nice
animal
in
the
zoo
came
into
emily
eyes
as
two
honest
drops
fell
from
them
would
hurt
me
she
faltered
could
let
other
people
hurt
me
hester
leaned
further
forward
in
her
chair
widening
upon
her
such
hysterically
insistent
terrible
young
eyes
as
made
her
shudder
do
you
she
cried
you
see
but
for
my
son
would
be
what
walderhurst
is
my
son
not
yours
i
understand
said
emily
i
understand
listen
osborn
went
on
through
her
teeth
even
for
that
there
are
things
i
have
the
nerve
to
stand
i
have
thought
i
could
stand
them
but
i
ca
it
does
not
matter
why
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
truth
you
represent
too
much
you
have
been
too
great
a
temptation
nobody
meant
anything
or
planned
anything
at
first
it
all
came
by
degrees
to
see
you
smiling
and
enjoying
everything
and
adoring
that
stilted
prig
of
a
walderhurst
put
ideas
into
people
heads
and
they
grew
because
every
chance
fed
them
if
walderhurst
would
come
home
lady
walderhurst
put
out
her
hand
to
a
letter
which
lay
on
the
table
i
heard
from
him
this
morning
she
said
and
he
has
been
sent
to
the
hills
because
he
has
a
little
fever
he
must
be
quiet
so
you
see
he
come
yet
she
was
shivering
though
she
was
determined
to
keep
still
what
was
in
the
milk
she
asked
in
the
milk
there
was
the
indian
root
ameerah
gave
the
village
girl
last
night
as
i
sat
under
a
tree
in
the
dark
i
heard
it
talked
over
only
a
few
native
women
know
it
there
was
a
singular
gravity
in
the
words
poor
lady
walderhurst
spoke
in
reply
that
she
said
would
have
been
the
cruelest
thing
of
all
osborn
got
up
and
came
close
to
her
if
you
had
gone
out
on
faustine
she
said
you
would
have
met
with
it
might
or
might
not
have
killed
you
but
it
would
have
been
an
accident
if
you
had
gone
downstairs
before
jane
cupp
saw
the
bit
of
broken
balustrade
you
might
have
been
killed
by
accident
again
if
you
had
leaned
upon
the
rail
of
the
bridge
you
would
have
been
drowned
and
no
human
being
could
have
been
accused
or
blamed
emily
gasped
for
breath
and
lifted
her
head
as
if
to
raise
it
above
the
wall
which
was
being
slowly
built
round
her
nothing
will
be
done
which
can
be
proved
said
hester
osborn
i
have
lived
among
native
people
and
know
if
ameerah
hated
me
and
i
could
not
get
rid
of
her
i
should
die
and
it
would
all
seem
quite
natural
she
bent
down
and
picked
up
the
empty
glass
from
the
carpet
it
is
a
good
thing
it
did
not
break
she
said
as
she
put
it
on
the
tray
ameerah
will
think
you
drank
the
milk
and
that
nothing
will
hurt
you
you
escape
them
always
she
will
be
frightened
as
she
said
it
she
began
to
cry
a
little
like
a
child
nothing
will
save
she
said
i
shall
have
to
go
back
i
shall
have
to
go
back
no
no
cried
emily
the
girl
swept
away
her
tears
with
the
back
of
a
clenched
hand
at
first
when
i
hated
you
she
was
even
petulant
and
plaintively
resentful
i
thought
i
could
let
it
go
on
i
watched
and
watched
and
bore
it
but
the
strain
was
too
great
i
broke
down
i
think
i
broke
down
one
night
when
something
began
to
beat
like
a
pulse
against
my
side
emily
got
up
and
stood
before
her
she
looked
perhaps
rather
as
she
had
looked
when
she
rose
and
stood
before
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
on
a
memorable
occasion
the
afternoon
on
the
moor
she
felt
almost
quiet
and
safe
what
must
i
do
she
asked
as
if
she
was
speaking
to
a
friend
i
am
afraid
tell
me
little
osborn
stood
still
and
stared
at
her
the
most
incongruous
thought
came
to
her
mind
she
found
herself
at
this
weird
moment
observing
how
well
the
woman
held
her
stupid
head
how
finely
it
was
set
on
her
shoulders
and
that
in
a
modern
royal
academy
way
she
was
rather
like
the
venus
of
milo
it
is
quite
out
of
place
to
think
such
things
at
such
a
time
but
she
found
herself
confronted
with
them
go
away
she
answered
it
is
all
like
a
thing
in
a
play
but
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
say
you
are
ordered
abroad
be
cool
and
simply
go
and
hide
yourself
somewhere
and
call
your
husband
home
as
soon
as
he
can
travel
emily
walderhurst
passed
her
hand
over
her
forehead
it
like
something
in
a
play
she
said
with
a
baffled
wondering
face
it
is
even
respectable
hester
began
to
laugh
no
it
is
even
respectable
she
cried
and
her
laughter
was
just
in
time
the
door
opened
and
alec
osborn
came
in
what
is
respectable
he
asked
something
i
have
been
telling
emily
she
answered
laughing
even
a
trifle
wildly
you
are
too
young
to
hear
such
things
you
must
be
kept
respectable
at
any
cost
he
grinned
but
faintly
scowled
at
the
same
time
you
upset
something
he
remarked
looking
at
the
carpet
i
have
indeed
said
hester
a
cup
of
tea
which
was
half
milk
it
will
leave
a
grease
spot
on
the
carpet
that
wo
be
respectable
when
she
had
tumbled
about
among
native
servants
as
a
child
she
had
learned
to
lie
quickly
and
she
was
very
ready
of
resource
chapter
nineteen
as
she
heard
the
brougham
draw
up
in
the
wet
street
before
the
door
warren
allowed
her
book
to
fall
closed
upon
her
lap
and
her
attractive
face
awakened
to
an
expression
of
agreeable
expectation
in
itself
denoting
the
existence
of
interesting
and
desirable
qualities
in
the
husband
at
the
moment
inserting
his
in
the
front
door
preparatory
to
mounting
the
stairs
and
joining
her
the
man
who
after
years
of
marriage
can
call
by
his
return
to
her
side
this
expression
to
the
countenance
of
an
intelligent
woman
is
without
question
or
argument
an
individual
whose
life
and
occupations
are
as
interesting
as
his
character
and
points
of
view
warren
was
of
the
mental
build
of
the
man
whose
life
would
be
interesting
and
full
of
outlook
if
it
were
spent
on
a
desert
island
or
in
the
bastille
he
possessed
the
temperament
which
annexes
incident
and
adventure
and
the
perceptiveness
of
imagination
which
turns
a
light
upon
the
merest
fragment
of
event
as
a
man
whose
days
were
filled
with
the
work
attendant
upon
the
exercise
of
a
profession
from
which
can
be
withheld
few
secrets
and
to
which
most
mysteries
explain
themselves
his
brain
was
the
recording
machine
of
impressions
which
might
have
stimulated
to
vividness
of
imagination
a
man
duller
than
himself
and
roused
to
feeling
one
of
far
less
warm
emotions
he
came
into
the
room
smiling
he
was
a
man
of
fifty
of
strong
build
and
masculine
he
had
good
shoulders
and
good
colour
and
the
eyes
nose
and
chin
of
a
man
it
would
be
a
stupid
thing
to
attempt
to
deal
with
in
a
blackguardly
manner
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
and
began
to
chat
as
was
his
habit
before
he
and
his
wife
parted
to
dress
for
dinner
when
he
was
out
during
the
day
he
often
looked
forward
to
these
chats
and
made
notes
of
things
he
would
like
to
tell
his
mary
during
her
day
which
was
given
to
feminine
duties
and
pleasures
she
frequently
did
the
same
thing
between
seven
and
eight
in
the
evening
they
had
delightful
conversational
opportunities
he
picked
up
her
book
and
glanced
it
over
he
asked
her
a
few
questions
and
answered
a
few
but
she
saw
it
was
with
a
somewhat
preoccupied
manner
she
knew
a
certain
remote
look
in
his
eye
and
she
waited
to
see
him
get
up
from
his
chair
and
begin
to
walk
to
and
fro
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
head
thrown
back
when
after
having
done
this
he
began
in
addition
to
whistle
softly
and
draw
his
eyebrows
together
she
broke
in
upon
him
in
the
manner
of
merely
following
an
established
custom
i
am
perfectly
sure
was
her
remark
that
you
have
come
upon
one
of
the
extraordinary
cases
the
last
two
words
were
spoken
as
with
inverted
commas
of
many
deep
interests
he
added
to
her
existence
the
extraordinary
cases
were
among
the
most
absorbing
he
had
begun
to
discuss
them
with
her
during
the
first
year
of
their
married
life
accident
had
thrown
one
of
them
into
her
immediate
personal
experience
and
her
comprehension
and
sympathy
in
summing
up
singular
evidence
had
been
of
such
value
to
him
that
he
had
turned
to
her
in
the
occurrence
of
others
for
the
aid
straightforward
mutual
logic
could
give
she
had
learned
to
await
the
extraordinary
case
with
something
like
eagerness
sometimes
it
was
true
its
incidents
were
painful
but
invariably
they
were
absorbing
in
their
interest
and
occasionally
illuminating
beyond
description
of
names
and
persons
it
was
not
necessary
she
should
hear
anything
the
drama
the
ethics
were
enough
with
an
absolute
respect
for
his
professional
reserves
she
asked
no
questions
he
could
not
reply
to
freely
and
avoided
even
the
innocent
following
of
clues
the
extraordinary
case
was
always
quite
enough
as
it
stood
when
she
saw
the
remotely
speculative
look
in
his
eye
she
suspected
one
when
he
left
his
chair
and
paced
the
floor
with
that
little
air
of
restlessness
and
ended
with
unconscious
whistling
which
was
scarcely
louder
than
a
breath
she
felt
that
evidence
enough
had
accumulated
for
her
he
stopped
and
turned
round
my
good
mary
he
owned
at
once
its
extraordinariness
consists
in
its
baffling
me
by
being
so
perfectly
ordinary
well
at
least
that
is
not
frequent
what
is
its
nature
is
it
awful
is
it
sad
is
it
eccentric
is
it
mad
or
sane
criminal
or
domestic
it
is
nothing
but
suggestive
and
that
it
suggests
mystery
to
me
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
myself
instead
of
a
serious
practitioner
am
a
professional
detective
is
it
a
case
in
which
you
might
need
help
it
is
a
case
in
which
i
am
impelled
to
give
help
if
it
proves
that
it
is
necessary
she
is
such
an
exceedingly
nice
woman
good
bad
or
indifferent
of
a
goodness
i
should
say
of
a
goodness
which
might
prevent
the
brain
acting
in
the
manner
in
which
a
brutal
world
requires
at
present
that
the
human
brain
should
act
in
of
a
goodness
which
may
possibly
have
betrayed
her
into
the
most
pathetic
trouble
of
the
kind
was
warren
suggestion
of
that
kind
with
a
troubled
look
but
she
is
a
married
woman
she
she
is
a
married
woman
no
she
does
not
say
so
but
she
looks
it
that
the
chief
feature
of
the
case
any
woman
bearing
more
obviously
the
stamp
of
respectable
british
matrimony
than
this
one
does
it
has
not
fallen
to
me
to
look
upon
warren
expression
was
in
the
extreme
there
was
a
freshness
in
this
at
least
but
if
she
bears
the
stamp
as
well
as
the
name
do
tell
me
all
it
is
possible
to
tell
come
and
sit
down
harold
he
sat
down
and
entered
into
details
i
was
called
to
a
lady
who
though
not
ill
seemed
fatigued
from
a
hurried
journey
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
the
effects
of
anxiety
and
repressed
excitement
i
found
her
in
a
in
a
street
it
was
a
house
which
had
the
air
of
a
place
hastily
made
inhabitable
for
some
special
reason
there
were
evidences
that
money
had
been
spent
but
that
there
had
been
no
time
to
arrange
things
i
have
seen
something
of
the
kind
before
and
when
i
was
handed
into
my
patient
thought
i
knew
the
type
i
should
find
it
is
always
more
or
less
the
same
a
girl
or
a
very
young
woman
pretty
and
refined
and
frightened
or
pretty
and
vulgar
and
it
off
with
transparent
pretences
and
airs
and
graces
anything
more
remote
from
what
i
expected
you
absolutely
can
not
conceive
not
young
and
pretty
about
or
six
a
fresh
finely
built
woman
with
eyes
as
candid
as
a
girl
quite
unexplanatory
and
with
the
best
possible
manner
only
sweetly
anxious
about
her
health
her
confidence
in
my
advice
and
the
earnestness
of
her
desire
to
obey
my
least
instructions
were
moving
ten
minutes
conversation
with
her
revealed
to
me
depths
of
romance
in
my
nature
i
mentally
began
to
swear
fealty
to
her
did
she
tell
you
that
her
husband
was
away
what
specially
struck
me
was
that
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
her
husband
required
stating
which
was
ingenuously
impressive
she
did
not
explain
her
mother
or
her
uncles
why
her
husband
her
mental
attitude
had
a
translucent
clearness
she
wanted
a
medical
man
to
take
charge
of
her
and
if
she
had
been
an
amiable
lady
who
was
a
member
of
the
royal
house
she
would
have
conversed
with
me
exactly
as
she
did
she
was
so
respectable
she
was
even
a
little
dear
mary
a
sort
of
clean
healthy
angel
there
an
incongruousness
in
the
figure
in
connection
with
being
obviously
in
hiding
in
a
street
and
warren
gave
herself
to
reflection
i
can
not
make
it
as
incongruous
as
she
was
i
have
not
told
you
all
i
have
saved
to
the
last
the
feature
which
marked
her
most
definitely
as
an
extraordinary
case
i
suppose
one
does
that
sort
of
thing
from
a
sense
of
drama
what
else
inquired
warren
roused
from
her
speculation
what
respectable
conclusion
one
deduce
from
the
fact
that
a
letter
lay
on
the
table
near
her
sealed
with
an
imposing
coat
of
arms
one
eye
having
accidentally
fallen
on
it
one
could
of
course
only
avoid
glancing
at
it
again
so
i
recognised
nothing
definite
also
when
i
was
announced
unexpectedly
i
saw
her
quickly
withdraw
her
hand
from
her
lips
she
had
been
kissing
a
ring
she
wore
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
afterwards
my
good
mary
it
was
a
ruby
of
a
size
and
colour
which
recalled
the
arabian
nights
warren
began
to
resign
herself
no
she
said
there
is
no
respectable
conclusion
to
be
drawn
it
is
tragic
but
prosaic
she
has
been
governess
or
companion
in
some
great
house
she
may
be
a
woman
it
is
ten
times
more
hideous
for
her
than
if
she
were
a
girl
she
has
to
writhe
under
knowing
that
both
her
friends
and
her
enemies
are
saying
that
she
had
not
the
excuse
of
not
having
been
old
enough
to
know
better
that
might
all
be
true
he
admitted
promptly
it
be
true
if
but
she
is
not
writhing
she
is
no
more
unhappy
than
you
or
i
she
is
only
anxious
and
i
could
swear
that
she
is
only
anxious
about
one
thing
the
moment
in
which
i
swore
fealty
to
her
was
when
she
said
to
me
want
to
be
quite
safe
until
after
i
do
not
care
for
myself
i
will
bear
anything
or
do
anything
only
one
thing
matters
i
shall
be
such
a
good
patient
then
her
eyes
grew
moist
and
she
closed
her
lips
decorously
to
keep
them
from
trembling
they
not
usually
like
that
warren
remarked
i
have
not
found
them
so
he
replied
perhaps
she
believes
the
man
will
marry
her
there
was
odd
unexpectedness
in
the
manner
in
which
warren
suddenly
began
to
laugh
my
dear
wife
if
you
could
see
her
it
is
the
incongruity
of
what
we
are
saying
which
makes
me
laugh
with
her
ruby
and
her
coronets
and
her
street
she
is
of
an
impeccableness
she
does
not
even
know
she
could
be
doubted
fifteen
years
of
matrimony
spent
in
south
kensington
three
girls
in
the
schoolroom
and
four
boys
at
eton
could
not
have
crystallised
a
more
unquestionable
serenity
and
you
are
saying
gravely
she
believes
the
man
will
marry
her
whatsoever
the
situation
is
i
am
absolutely
sure
that
she
has
never
asked
herself
whether
he
would
or
not
then
warren
answered
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
case
we
have
had
yet
but
i
have
sworn
fealty
to
her
was
warren
conclusion
and
she
will
tell
me
more
later
he
shook
his
head
with
an
air
of
certainty
yes
she
will
feel
it
necessary
to
tell
me
later
they
went
upstairs
to
dress
for
dinner
and
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
which
they
spent
alone
they
talked
almost
entirely
of
the
matter
chapter
twenty
lady
walderhurst
departure
from
palstrey
though
unexpected
had
been
calm
and
all
the
osborns
knew
was
that
she
had
been
obliged
to
go
up
to
london
for
a
day
or
two
and
that
when
there
her
physician
had
advised
certain
german
baths
her
letter
of
explanation
and
apology
was
very
nice
she
could
not
return
to
the
country
before
beginning
her
journey
it
seemed
probable
that
she
would
return
with
her
husband
who
might
arrive
in
england
during
the
next
two
months
has
she
heard
that
he
is
coming
back
captain
osborn
asked
his
wife
she
has
written
to
ask
him
to
come
osborn
grinned
he
will
be
obliged
to
her
he
is
tremendously
pleased
with
his
importance
at
this
particular
time
and
he
is
just
the
sort
of
man
as
we
both
know
to
be
delighted
at
being
called
back
to
preside
over
an
affair
which
is
usually
a
matter
for
old
women
but
the
letter
he
had
examined
as
it
lay
with
the
rest
awaiting
postal
he
had
taken
charge
of
himself
he
knew
that
one
at
least
would
not
reach
lord
walderhurst
having
heard
in
time
of
the
broken
he
had
been
astute
enough
to
guess
that
the
letter
written
immediately
after
the
incident
might
convey
such
impressions
as
might
lead
even
his
lordship
to
feel
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
be
at
home
the
woman
had
been
frightened
and
would
be
sure
to
lose
her
head
and
play
the
fool
in
a
few
days
she
would
calm
down
and
the
affair
would
assume
smaller
proportions
at
any
rate
he
had
chosen
to
take
charge
of
this
particular
letter
what
he
did
not
know
however
was
that
chance
had
played
into
his
hands
in
the
matter
of
temporarily
upsetting
lord
walderhurst
rather
unreliable
digestion
and
in
altering
his
plans
by
a
smart
though
not
dangerous
attack
of
fever
which
had
ended
in
his
being
ordered
to
a
part
of
the
hill
country
not
faithfully
reached
by
letters
as
a
result
of
which
several
communications
from
his
wife
went
astray
and
were
unduly
delayed
at
the
time
captain
osborn
was
discussing
him
with
hester
he
was
taking
annoyed
care
of
himself
with
the
aid
of
a
doctor
irritated
by
the
untoward
disturbance
of
his
arrangements
and
giving
it
is
true
comparatively
little
thought
to
his
wife
who
being
comfortably
installed
at
palstrey
manor
was
doubtless
enjoyably
absorbed
in
little
osborn
what
german
baths
does
she
intend
going
to
alec
osborn
inquired
hester
consulted
the
letter
with
a
manner
denoting
but
languid
interest
it
rather
like
her
that
she
does
go
to
the
length
of
explaining
was
her
reply
she
has
a
way
of
telling
you
a
great
many
things
you
do
care
to
know
and
forgetting
to
mention
those
you
are
interested
in
she
is
very
detailed
about
her
health
and
her
affection
and
mine
she
evidently
expects
us
to
go
back
to
the
kennel
farm
and
deplores
her
inhospitality
with
adjectives
she
did
not
look
as
if
she
was
playing
a
part
but
she
was
playing
one
and
doing
it
well
her
little
way
was
that
of
a
woman
made
spiteful
by
being
called
upon
to
leave
a
place
which
suited
her
you
are
not
really
any
fonder
of
her
than
i
am
commented
osborn
after
regarding
her
speculatively
a
few
moments
if
he
had
been
as
sure
of
her
as
he
had
been
of
ameerah
i
do
know
of
any
reason
for
my
being
particularly
fond
of
her
she
said
it
easy
enough
for
a
rich
woman
to
be
it
cost
her
enough
to
constitute
a
claim
osborn
helped
himself
to
a
stiff
whiskey
and
soda
they
went
back
to
the
kennel
farm
the
next
day
and
though
it
was
his
habit
to
consume
a
large
number
of
pegs
daily
the
habit
increased
until
there
were
not
many
hours
in
the
day
when
he
was
normally
sure
of
what
he
was
doing
the
german
baths
to
which
lady
walderhurst
had
gone
were
nearer
to
palstrey
than
any
one
knew
they
were
only
at
a
few
hours
distance
by
rail
when
after
a
day
spent
in
a
quiet
london
lodging
cupp
returned
to
her
mistress
with
the
information
that
she
had
been
to
the
house
in
mortimer
street
and
found
that
the
widow
who
had
bought
the
lease
and
furniture
was
worn
out
with
and
the
uncertainty
of
lodgers
and
only
longed
for
release
which
was
not
ruin
emily
cried
a
little
for
joy
oh
how
i
should
like
to
be
there
she
said
it
was
such
a
dear
house
no
one
would
ever
dream
of
my
being
in
it
and
i
need
have
no
one
but
you
and
jane
i
should
be
so
safe
and
quiet
tell
her
you
have
a
friend
who
will
take
it
as
it
is
for
a
year
and
pay
her
anything
i
wo
tell
her
quite
that
my
lady
cupp
made
sagacious
answer
i
make
her
an
offer
in
ready
money
down
and
no
questions
asked
by
either
of
us
people
in
her
position
sometimes
gets
a
sudden
let
that
pays
them
better
than
lodgers
all
classes
has
their
troubles
and
sometimes
a
decent
house
is
wanted
for
a
few
months
where
money
can
be
paid
i
make
her
an
offer
the
outcome
of
which
was
that
the
widowed
householder
walked
out
of
her
domicile
the
next
morning
with
a
heavier
purse
and
a
lighter
mind
than
she
had
known
for
many
months
the
same
night
ingenuously
oblivious
of
having
been
called
upon
to
fill
the
role
of
a
lady
in
genteel
trouble
good
and
decorous
emily
walderhurst
arrived
under
the
cover
of
discreet
darkness
in
a
cab
and
when
she
found
herself
in
the
best
bedroom
which
had
once
been
so
far
beyond
her
means
she
cried
a
little
for
joy
again
because
the
four
dull
walls
the
mahogany
and
ugly
frilled
pincushions
looked
so
unmelodramatically
normal
and
safe
it
seems
so
she
said
adding
courageously
it
is
a
very
comfortable
place
really
we
can
make
it
much
more
cheerful
my
lady
jane
said
with
grateful
appreciation
and
the
relief
makes
it
like
paradise
she
was
leaving
the
room
and
stopped
at
the
door
there
not
a
person
black
or
white
can
get
across
the
past
mother
and
me
until
his
lordship
comes
she
allowed
herself
the
privilege
of
adding
emily
felt
a
little
nervous
when
she
pictured
to
herself
lord
walderhurst
crossing
the
of
a
house
in
mortimer
street
in
search
of
his
marchioness
she
had
not
yet
had
time
to
tell
him
the
story
of
the
episode
of
the
glass
of
milk
and
hester
osborn
sudden
outburst
every
moment
had
been
given
to
carefully
managed
arrangement
for
the
journey
which
was
to
seem
so
natural
hester
cleverness
had
suggested
every
step
and
had
supported
her
throughout
but
for
hester
she
was
afraid
she
might
have
betrayed
herself
there
had
been
no
time
for
writing
but
when
james
received
her
letter
of
late
she
had
more
than
once
thought
of
him
as
james
he
would
know
the
one
thing
that
was
important
and
she
had
asked
him
to
come
to
her
she
had
apologised
for
suggesting
any
alteration
of
his
plans
but
she
had
really
asked
him
to
come
to
her
i
think
he
will
come
she
said
to
herself
i
do
think
he
will
i
shall
be
so
glad
perhaps
i
have
not
been
sensible
perhaps
i
have
not
done
the
best
thing
but
if
i
keep
myself
safe
until
he
comes
back
that
really
seems
what
is
most
important
two
or
three
days
in
the
familiar
rooms
attended
only
by
the
two
friendly
creatures
she
knew
so
well
seemed
to
restore
the
balance
of
life
for
her
existence
became
comfortable
and
prosaic
again
the
best
bedroom
and
the
room
in
which
she
spent
her
days
were
made
quite
cheerful
through
jane
enterprise
and
memories
of
the
appointments
of
palstrey
jane
brought
her
tea
in
the
morning
cupp
presided
over
the
kitchen
the
agreeable
doctor
whose
reputation
they
had
heard
so
much
of
came
and
went
leaving
his
patient
feeling
that
she
might
establish
a
friendship
he
looked
so
clever
and
so
kind
she
began
to
smile
her
childlike
smile
again
cupp
and
jane
told
each
other
in
private
that
if
she
had
not
been
a
married
lady
they
would
have
felt
that
she
was
miss
again
she
looked
so
like
herself
with
her
fresh
colour
and
her
nice
cheerful
eyes
and
yet
to
think
of
the
changes
there
had
been
and
what
they
had
gone
through
people
in
london
know
nothing
or
everything
of
their
neighbours
the
people
who
lived
in
mortimer
street
were
of
the
keeping
class
and
had
too
many
anxieties
connected
with
butcher
bills
rent
and
taxes
to
be
able
to
give
much
time
to
their
neighbours
the
life
in
the
house
which
had
changed
hands
had
nothing
noticeable
about
it
it
looked
from
the
outside
as
it
had
always
looked
the
were
kept
clean
milk
was
taken
in
twice
a
day
and
local
tradesmen
carts
left
things
in
the
ordinary
manner
a
doctor
occasionally
called
to
see
someone
and
the
only
person
who
had
inquired
about
the
patient
she
was
a
friendly
creature
who
met
cupp
at
the
grocer
and
exchanged
a
few
neighbourly
words
was
told
that
ladies
who
lived
in
furnished
apartments
and
had
nothing
to
do
seemed
to
find
an
interest
in
seeing
a
doctor
about
things
had
no
time
to
bother
about
cupp
view
seemed
to
be
that
doctor
visits
and
medicine
bottles
furnished
entertainment
jameson
had
as
good
a
colour
and
as
good
an
appetite
as
you
or
me
but
she
was
one
who
thought
she
caught
cold
easy
and
she
was
afraid
of
fresh
air
warren
interest
in
the
extraordinary
case
increased
at
each
visit
he
made
he
did
not
see
the
ruby
ring
again
when
he
had
left
the
house
after
his
first
call
cupp
had
called
lady
walderhurst
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
ring
was
on
her
hand
and
could
not
be
considered
compatible
with
even
a
first
floor
front
in
mortimer
street
emily
had
been
frightened
and
had
removed
it
but
the
thing
that
upsets
me
when
i
hand
him
in
jane
said
to
her
mother
anxiously
in
private
is
the
way
she
ca
help
looking
you
know
what
i
mean
mother
her
nice
free
look
and
we
never
talk
to
her
about
it
we
should
have
to
let
her
know
that
more
than
likely
he
thinks
she
just
what
she
is
it
makes
me
mad
to
think
of
it
but
as
it
had
to
be
if
she
only
looked
a
little
awkward
or
not
such
a
lady
or
a
bit
uppish
and
fretful
she
would
seem
so
much
more
real
and
then
there
another
thing
you
know
she
always
carry
her
head
well
even
when
she
was
nothing
but
poor
miss
tramping
about
shopping
with
muddy
feet
and
now
having
been
a
marchioness
till
she
got
used
to
it
and
knowing
that
she
is
one
gives
her
an
innocent
stately
look
sometimes
it
a
thing
she
know
of
herself
but
i
do
declare
that
sometimes
as
she
sat
there
talking
just
as
sweet
as
could
be
i
felt
as
if
i
ought
to
say
if
you
please
my
lady
if
you
look
not
quite
so
much
as
if
you
got
on
a
tiara
ah
and
cupp
shook
her
head
but
that
what
her
maker
did
for
her
she
was
born
just
what
she
looks
and
she
looks
just
what
she
was
born
a
respectable
female
whereby
warren
continued
to
feel
himself
baffled
she
only
goes
out
for
exercise
after
dark
mary
he
said
also
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
have
discovered
that
she
believes
every
word
of
the
bible
literally
and
would
be
alarmed
if
one
could
not
accept
the
athanasian
creed
she
is
rather
wounded
and
puzzled
by
the
curses
it
contains
but
she
feels
sure
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
question
anything
in
the
church
service
her
extraordinariness
is
wholly
her
incompatibleness
gradually
they
had
established
the
friendship
emily
had
thought
possible
once
or
twice
warren
took
tea
with
her
her
unabashed
and
accustomed
readiness
of
hospitality
was
as
incompatible
with
her
circumstances
as
all
the
rest
she
had
the
ease
of
a
woman
who
had
amiably
poured
out
tea
for
afternoon
callers
all
her
life
women
who
were
uncertain
of
themselves
were
not
amiably
at
ease
with
small
social
amenities
her
ingenuous
talk
and
her
fervent
italics
were
an
absolute
delight
to
the
man
who
was
studying
her
he
too
had
noticed
the
carriage
of
her
head
jane
cupp
had
deplored
i
should
say
she
was
well
born
he
commented
to
his
wife
she
holds
herself
as
no
common
woman
could
ah
i
have
a
doubt
that
she
is
well
born
poor
soul
no
not
soul
no
woman
who
is
as
happy
as
she
is
needs
pity
since
she
has
had
time
to
rest
she
looks
radiant
in
course
of
time
however
she
was
less
radiant
most
people
know
something
of
waiting
for
answers
to
letters
written
to
foreign
lands
it
seems
impossible
to
calculate
correctly
as
to
what
length
of
time
must
elapse
before
the
reply
to
the
letter
one
sent
by
the
last
mail
can
reach
one
he
who
waits
is
always
premature
in
the
calculation
he
makes
the
mail
should
be
due
at
a
certain
date
one
is
so
sure
the
letter
could
be
written
on
such
a
day
and
posted
at
once
but
the
date
calculated
for
arrives
passes
the
answer
has
not
come
who
does
not
remember
emily
walderhurst
had
passed
through
the
experience
and
knew
it
well
but
previously
the
letters
she
had
sent
had
been
of
less
vital
importance
when
the
replies
to
them
had
lingered
on
their
way
she
had
it
is
true
watched
eagerly
for
the
postman
and
had
lived
restlessly
between
the
arrivals
of
the
mails
but
she
had
taught
herself
resignation
to
the
inevitable
now
life
had
altered
its
aspect
and
its
significance
she
had
tried
with
the
aid
of
an
untried
imagination
to
paint
to
herself
the
moments
in
which
her
husband
would
read
the
letter
which
told
him
what
she
had
told
she
had
wondered
if
he
would
start
if
he
would
look
amazed
if
his
eyes
would
light
with
pleasure
might
he
not
want
to
see
her
might
he
not
perhaps
write
at
once
she
never
could
advance
farther
in
her
imagined
reading
of
this
reply
than
the
first
lines
my
dear
emily
the
unexpected
good
news
your
letter
contains
has
given
me
the
greatest
satisfaction
you
do
not
perhaps
know
how
strong
my
desire
has
been
she
used
to
sit
and
flush
with
happiness
when
she
reached
this
point
she
so
wished
that
she
was
capable
of
depicting
to
herself
what
the
rest
would
be
she
calculated
with
the
utmost
care
the
probable
date
of
the
arrival
she
thought
she
made
sure
of
allowing
plenty
of
time
for
all
possible
delays
the
safety
of
her
letters
she
had
managed
with
hester
aid
to
arrange
for
they
were
forwarded
to
her
bankers
and
called
for
only
the
letters
from
india
were
of
any
importance
and
they
were
not
frequent
she
told
herself
that
she
must
be
even
more
than
usually
patient
this
time
when
the
letter
arrived
if
he
told
her
he
felt
it
proper
that
he
should
return
no
part
of
the
strange
experience
she
had
passed
through
would
be
of
moment
when
she
saw
his
decorous
face
and
heard
his
correctly
modulated
voice
all
else
would
seem
like
an
unnatural
dream
in
her
relief
at
the
decent
composure
of
the
first
floor
front
in
mortimer
street
the
days
did
not
seem
at
first
to
pass
slowly
but
as
the
date
she
had
counted
on
drew
near
she
could
not
restrain
a
natural
restlessness
she
looked
at
the
clock
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
a
good
deal
she
was
also
very
glad
when
night
came
and
she
could
go
to
bed
then
she
was
glad
when
the
morning
arrived
because
she
was
a
day
nearer
to
the
end
on
a
certain
evening
warren
said
to
his
wife
she
is
not
so
well
when
i
called
i
found
her
looking
pale
and
anxious
when
i
commented
on
the
fact
and
asked
how
she
was
she
said
that
she
had
had
a
disappointment
she
had
been
expecting
an
important
letter
by
a
mail
arriving
yesterday
and
it
had
not
come
she
was
evidently
in
low
spirits
perhaps
she
has
kept
up
her
spirits
before
because
she
believed
the
letter
would
come
warren
speculated
she
has
certainly
believed
it
would
come
do
think
it
will
harold
she
thinks
it
will
yet
she
was
pathetically
anxious
not
to
be
impatient
she
said
she
knew
there
were
so
many
reasons
for
delay
when
people
were
in
foreign
countries
and
very
much
occupied
there
are
many
reasons
i
daresay
said
warren
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
they
are
not
usually
the
ones
given
to
waiting
desperate
women
warren
stood
upon
the
hearthrug
and
gazed
into
the
fire
knitting
his
brows
she
wanted
to
tell
or
ask
me
something
this
afternoon
he
said
but
she
was
afraid
she
looked
like
a
good
child
in
great
trouble
i
think
she
will
speak
before
long
she
looked
more
and
more
like
a
good
child
in
trouble
as
time
passed
mail
after
mail
came
in
and
she
received
no
letter
she
did
not
understand
and
her
fresh
colour
died
away
she
spent
her
time
now
in
inventing
reasons
for
the
of
her
letter
none
of
them
comprised
explanations
which
could
be
disparaging
in
any
sense
to
walderhurst
chiefly
she
clung
to
the
fact
that
he
had
not
been
well
anything
could
be
considered
a
reason
for
neglecting
letter
writing
if
a
man
was
not
well
if
his
illness
had
become
serious
she
would
of
course
have
heard
from
his
doctor
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
contemplate
that
but
if
he
was
languid
and
feverish
he
might
so
easily
put
off
writing
from
day
to
day
this
was
all
the
more
plausible
as
a
reason
since
he
had
not
been
a
profuse
correspondent
he
had
only
written
when
he
had
found
he
had
leisure
with
decent
irregularity
so
to
speak
at
last
however
on
a
day
when
she
had
felt
the
strain
of
waiting
greater
than
she
had
courage
for
and
had
counted
every
moment
of
the
hour
which
must
elapse
before
jane
could
return
from
her
mission
of
inquiry
as
she
rested
on
the
sofa
she
heard
the
girl
mount
the
stairs
with
a
step
whose
hastened
lightness
wakened
in
her
an
excited
hopefulness
she
sat
up
with
brightened
face
and
eager
eyes
how
foolish
she
had
been
to
fret
now
now
everything
would
be
different
ah
how
thankful
she
was
to
god
for
being
so
good
to
her
i
think
you
must
have
a
letter
jane
she
said
the
moment
the
door
opened
i
felt
it
when
i
heard
your
footstep
jane
was
touching
in
her
glow
of
relief
and
affection
yes
my
lady
i
have
indeed
and
they
said
at
the
bank
that
it
had
come
by
a
steamer
that
was
delayed
by
bad
weather
emily
took
the
letter
her
hand
shook
but
it
was
with
pleasure
she
forgot
jane
and
actually
kissed
the
envelope
before
she
opened
it
it
looked
like
a
beautiful
long
letter
it
was
quite
thick
but
when
she
had
opened
it
she
saw
that
the
letter
itself
was
not
very
long
several
extra
sheets
of
notes
or
instructions
it
did
not
matter
what
seemed
to
be
enclosed
her
hand
shook
so
that
she
let
them
fall
on
the
floor
she
looked
so
agitated
that
jane
was
afraid
to
do
more
than
retire
discreetly
and
stand
outside
the
door
in
a
few
minutes
she
congratulated
herself
on
the
wisdom
of
not
having
gone
downstairs
she
heard
a
troubled
exclamation
of
wonder
and
then
a
call
for
herself
jane
please
jane
lady
walderhurst
was
still
sitting
upon
the
sofa
but
she
looked
pale
and
unsteady
the
letter
was
in
her
hand
which
rested
weakly
in
her
lap
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
so
bewildered
that
she
felt
helpless
she
spoke
in
a
tired
voice
jane
she
said
i
think
you
will
have
to
get
me
a
glass
of
wine
i
do
think
i
am
going
to
faint
but
i
do
feel
so
so
upset
jane
was
at
her
side
kneeling
by
her
please
my
lady
lie
down
she
begged
please
do
but
she
did
not
lie
down
she
sat
trembling
and
looking
at
the
girl
in
a
pathetic
puzzled
fashion
i
do
think
she
quavered
that
his
lordship
can
have
received
my
letter
he
ca
have
received
it
he
does
say
anything
he
say
one
word
she
had
been
too
healthy
a
woman
to
be
subject
to
attacks
of
nerves
she
had
never
fainted
before
in
her
life
and
as
she
spoke
she
did
not
at
all
understand
why
jane
seemed
to
move
up
and
down
and
darkness
came
on
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
jane
managed
by
main
strength
to
keep
her
from
falling
from
the
sofa
and
thanked
providence
for
the
power
vouchsafed
to
her
she
reached
the
bell
and
rang
it
violently
and
hearing
it
cupp
came
upstairs
with
heavy
swiftness
chapter
twenty
one
naturally
a
perceptive
and
closely
reasoning
woman
warren
close
intellectual
intimacy
with
her
husband
had
in
giving
her
the
benefit
of
intercourse
with
a
wide
experience
added
greatly
to
her
power
of
reasoning
by
deduction
warren
frequently
felt
that
his
talk
with
her
was
something
like
consultation
with
a
specially
clever
and
sympathetic
professional
confrère
her
suggestions
or
conclusions
were
invariably
worth
consideration
more
than
once
his
reflection
upon
them
had
led
him
to
excellent
results
she
made
one
night
a
suggestion
with
regard
to
the
extraordinary
case
which
struck
him
as
being
more
than
usually
astute
is
she
an
intellectual
woman
she
inquired
not
in
the
least
an
unsparingly
brilliant
person
might
feel
himself
entitled
to
the
right
to
call
her
stupid
is
she
talkative
far
from
it
one
of
her
charms
is
the
nice
respect
she
seems
to
feel
for
the
remarks
of
others
and
she
is
not
excitable
rather
the
reverse
if
excitability
is
liveliness
she
is
dull
i
see
slowly
you
have
not
yet
thought
it
possible
that
she
might
well
be
under
some
delusion
warren
turned
quickly
and
looked
at
her
it
is
wonderfully
brilliant
of
you
to
have
thought
of
it
a
delusion
he
stood
and
thought
it
over
do
you
remember
his
wife
assisted
him
with
the
complications
which
arose
from
young
jerrold
running
away
under
similar
circumstances
to
scotland
and
hiding
herself
in
a
shepherd
cottage
under
the
impression
that
her
husband
was
shadowing
her
with
detectives
you
recollect
what
a
lovable
woman
she
was
and
what
horror
she
felt
of
the
poor
fellow
yes
yes
that
was
an
extraordinary
case
too
warren
warmed
with
her
subject
here
is
a
woman
obviously
concealing
herself
from
the
world
in
a
plainly
possessing
money
owning
a
huge
ruby
ring
receiving
documents
stamped
with
imposing
seals
taking
exercise
only
by
night
over
the
of
letters
which
are
due
every
detail
points
to
one
painful
dubious
situation
on
the
other
hand
she
presents
to
you
the
manner
and
aspect
of
a
woman
who
is
absolutely
not
dubious
and
who
is
merely
anxious
on
the
one
point
a
dubious
person
would
be
indifferent
to
is
it
then
possible
that
physical
condition
may
have
driven
her
to
the
belief
that
she
is
hiding
from
danger
warren
was
evidently
following
the
thought
seriously
she
said
reflecting
that
all
that
mattered
was
that
she
should
be
safe
want
to
keep
safe
that
was
it
you
are
very
enlightening
mary
always
i
will
go
and
see
her
again
but
as
the
result
of
another
memory
how
sane
she
seems
he
was
thinking
of
this
possible
aspect
of
the
matter
as
he
mounted
the
staircase
of
the
house
in
mortimer
street
the
next
day
the
stairway
was
of
the
ordinary
type
its
dinginess
somewhat
alleviated
by
the
fact
that
the
cupps
had
covered
the
worn
carpet
with
clean
felting
the
yellowish
marbled
paper
on
the
walls
depressed
the
mind
as
one
passed
it
the
indeterminate
dun
paint
had
defied
fog
for
years
the
whole
house
presented
only
such
features
as
would
encourage
its
proprietors
to
trust
to
the
sufficing
of
infrequent
jane
had
however
made
efforts
in
behalf
of
the
in
which
her
mistress
spent
her
days
she
had
introduced
palliations
by
degrees
and
with
an
unobtrusiveness
which
was
not
likely
to
attract
the
attention
of
neighbours
unaccustomed
to
lavish
delivery
by
means
of
furniture
vans
she
had
brought
in
a
rug
or
so
and
had
gradually
replaced
objects
with
such
as
were
more
pleasant
to
live
with
and
more
comfortable
to
use
warren
had
seen
the
change
wrought
and
had
noted
evidences
that
money
was
not
unobtainable
the
maid
also
was
a
young
woman
whose
manner
towards
her
mistress
was
not
merely
respectful
and
but
suggestive
of
watchful
affection
bordering
on
reverence
jane
cupp
herself
was
a
certificate
of
decorum
and
good
standing
it
was
not
such
young
women
who
secluded
themselves
with
questionable
situations
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
door
to
open
it
and
announce
him
it
occurred
to
warren
that
he
would
tell
mary
that
evening
that
if
jameson
had
been
the
heroine
of
any
unconventional
domestic
drama
it
was
an
unmistakable
fact
that
jane
cupp
would
have
felt
it
her
duty
as
a
young
woman
to
leave
this
day
month
if
you
please
quite
six
months
ago
and
there
she
was
in
a
neat
gown
and
apron
evidently
a
fixture
because
she
liked
her
place
her
decent
young
face
full
of
sympathetic
interest
the
day
was
dull
and
cold
but
the
front
room
was
warm
and
made
cheerful
by
fire
jameson
was
sitting
at
a
there
were
letters
before
her
and
she
seemed
to
have
been
them
she
did
not
any
longer
bloom
with
normal
health
her
face
was
a
little
dragged
and
the
first
thing
he
noted
in
the
eyes
she
lifted
to
him
was
that
they
were
bewildered
she
has
had
a
shock
he
thought
poor
woman
he
began
to
talk
to
her
about
herself
with
the
kindly
perception
which
was
inseparable
from
him
he
wondered
if
the
time
had
not
come
when
she
would
confide
in
him
her
shock
whatsoever
it
had
been
had
left
her
in
the
position
of
a
woman
wholly
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
what
had
occurred
he
saw
this
in
her
ingenuous
troubled
face
he
felt
as
if
she
was
asking
herself
what
she
should
do
it
was
not
unlikely
that
presently
she
would
ask
him
what
she
should
do
he
had
been
asked
such
things
before
by
women
but
they
usually
added
trying
detail
accompanied
by
sobs
and
appealed
to
his
chivalry
for
impossible
aid
sometimes
they
implored
him
to
go
to
people
and
use
his
influence
emily
answered
all
his
questions
with
her
usual
sweet
good
sense
she
was
not
well
yesterday
she
had
fainted
was
there
any
disturbing
reason
for
the
faint
he
inquired
it
was
because
i
was
very
much
disappointed
she
answered
hesitating
i
had
a
letter
which
it
was
not
what
i
expected
she
was
thinking
desperately
she
could
understand
nothing
it
was
not
explainable
that
what
she
had
written
did
not
matter
at
all
that
james
should
have
made
no
reply
i
was
awake
all
night
she
added
that
must
not
go
on
he
said
i
was
thinking
and
thinking
nervously
i
can
see
that
was
his
answer
perhaps
she
ought
to
have
courage
to
say
nothing
it
might
be
safer
but
it
was
so
lonely
not
to
dare
to
ask
anyone
advice
that
she
was
getting
frightened
india
was
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles
away
and
letters
took
so
long
to
come
and
go
anxiety
might
make
her
ill
before
she
could
receive
a
reply
to
a
second
letter
and
perhaps
now
in
her
terror
she
had
put
herself
into
a
ridiculous
position
how
could
she
send
for
lady
maria
to
mortimer
street
and
explain
to
her
she
realised
also
that
her
ladyship
sense
of
humour
might
not
be
a
thing
to
confide
in
safely
warren
strong
amiable
personality
was
good
for
her
it
served
to
aid
her
to
normal
reasoning
though
she
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
her
fears
her
simplicity
and
her
timorous
adoration
of
her
husband
had
not
allowed
her
to
reason
normally
in
the
past
she
had
been
too
anxious
and
too
much
afraid
her
visitor
watched
her
with
great
interest
and
no
little
curiosity
he
himself
saw
that
her
mood
was
not
normal
she
did
not
look
as
poor
jerrold
had
looked
but
she
was
not
in
a
normal
state
he
made
his
visit
a
long
one
purposely
tea
was
brought
up
and
he
drank
it
with
her
he
wanted
to
give
her
time
to
make
up
her
mind
about
him
when
at
last
he
rose
to
go
away
she
rose
also
she
looked
nervously
undecided
but
let
him
go
towards
the
door
her
move
forward
was
curiously
sudden
no
no
she
said
please
come
back
i
oh
i
really
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
he
turned
towards
her
wishing
that
mary
were
with
him
she
stood
trying
to
smile
and
looking
so
entirely
nice
and
even
in
her
agitation
if
i
were
not
so
puzzled
or
if
there
was
she
said
if
you
could
only
advise
me
i
must
i
keep
safe
there
is
something
you
want
to
tell
me
he
said
quietly
yes
she
answered
i
am
so
anxious
and
i
am
sure
it
must
be
bad
for
one
to
be
anxious
always
i
have
not
dared
to
tell
anyone
my
name
is
not
jameson
warren
i
am
i
am
lady
walderhurst
he
barely
managed
to
restrain
a
start
he
was
obliged
to
admit
to
himself
that
he
had
not
thought
of
anything
like
this
but
mary
had
been
right
emily
blushed
to
her
ears
with
embarrassment
he
did
not
believe
her
but
i
really
she
protested
i
am
i
was
married
last
year
i
was
emily
perhaps
you
remember
she
was
not
flighty
or
indignant
her
frank
face
was
only
a
little
more
troubled
than
it
had
been
before
she
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
without
a
doubt
of
his
presently
believing
her
good
heavens
if
she
walked
to
the
and
picked
up
a
number
of
letters
they
were
all
stamped
with
the
same
seal
she
brought
them
to
him
almost
composedly
i
ought
to
have
remembered
how
strange
it
would
sound
she
said
in
her
amenable
voice
i
hope
i
am
not
doing
wrong
in
speaking
i
hope
you
wo
mind
my
troubling
you
it
seemed
as
if
i
bear
it
alone
any
longer
after
which
she
told
him
her
story
the
unadorned
straightforwardness
of
the
relation
made
it
an
amazing
thing
to
hear
even
more
amazing
than
it
would
have
been
made
by
a
more
imaginative
handling
her
obvious
inability
to
cope
with
the
unusual
and
villainous
combined
with
her
entire
willingness
to
obliterate
herself
in
any
manner
in
her
tenderness
for
the
one
present
object
of
her
existence
were
things
a
man
could
not
be
unmoved
by
even
though
experience
led
him
to
smile
at
the
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
world
which
had
left
her
without
practical
defence
her
very
humbleness
and
candour
made
her
a
drama
in
herself
perhaps
i
was
wrong
to
run
away
perhaps
only
a
silly
woman
would
have
done
such
a
queer
unconventional
thing
but
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
so
likely
to
be
quite
safe
until
lord
walderhurst
could
advise
me
and
when
his
letter
came
yesterday
and
he
did
not
speak
of
what
i
had
said
her
voice
quite
failed
her
captain
osborn
has
detained
your
letter
lord
walderhurst
has
not
seen
it
life
began
to
come
back
to
her
she
had
been
so
horribly
bewildered
as
to
think
at
moments
that
perhaps
it
might
be
that
a
man
who
was
very
much
absorbed
in
affairs
the
information
you
sent
him
is
the
most
important
and
moving
a
man
in
his
position
could
receive
do
you
think
so
she
lifted
her
head
with
new
courage
and
her
colour
returned
it
is
impossible
that
it
should
be
otherwise
it
is
i
assure
you
lady
walderhurst
i
am
so
thankful
she
said
devoutly
i
am
so
that
i
have
told
you
anything
more
touching
and
attractive
than
her
full
eyes
and
her
child
smile
he
felt
he
had
never
seen
chapter
twenty
two
the
attack
of
fever
which
had
seemed
to
begin
lightly
for
lord
walderhurst
assumed
proportions
such
as
his
medical
man
had
not
anticipated
his
annoyance
at
finding
his
duties
interfered
with
fretted
him
greatly
he
was
not
under
the
circumstances
a
good
patient
and
partly
as
a
result
of
his
state
of
mind
he
began
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
to
give
his
doctors
rather
serious
cause
for
anxiety
on
the
morning
following
emily
confession
to
warren
she
had
received
a
letter
from
her
husband
physician
notifying
her
of
his
new
anxieties
in
connection
with
his
patient
his
lordship
required
extreme
care
and
absolute
freedom
from
all
excitement
everything
which
medical
science
and
perfect
nursing
could
do
would
be
done
the
writer
asked
lady
walderhurst
collaboration
with
him
in
his
efforts
at
keeping
the
invalid
as
far
as
possible
in
unperturbed
spirits
for
some
time
it
seemed
probable
that
letter
writing
and
reading
would
be
out
of
the
question
but
if
when
correspondence
might
be
resumed
lady
walderhurst
would
keep
in
mind
the
importance
of
serenity
to
the
convalescent
the
case
would
have
all
in
its
favour
this
combined
with
expressions
of
sympathetic
encouragement
and
assurances
that
the
best
might
be
hoped
for
was
the
gist
of
the
letter
when
warren
arrived
emily
handed
the
epistle
to
him
and
watched
him
as
he
read
it
you
see
she
said
when
he
looked
up
that
i
did
not
speak
too
soon
now
i
shall
have
to
trust
to
you
for
everything
i
could
have
borne
it
by
myself
could
i
perhaps
not
thinking
it
over
but
you
are
very
brave
i
do
think
i
brave
thinking
it
over
on
her
own
part
but
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
things
i
do
but
now
you
will
advise
me
she
was
as
biddable
as
a
child
he
told
his
wife
afterwards
and
that
a
woman
of
her
height
and
carriage
should
be
as
biddable
as
she
might
have
been
at
six
years
old
was
an
effective
thing
she
will
do
anything
i
tell
her
she
will
go
anywhere
i
advise
i
advise
that
she
shall
go
to
her
husband
house
in
berkeley
square
and
that
together
you
and
i
will
keep
unobtrusive
guard
over
her
all
is
quite
simple
really
all
would
have
been
comparatively
simple
at
the
outset
if
she
had
felt
sure
enough
of
her
evidence
to
dare
to
confide
in
some
practical
person
but
she
was
too
uncertain
and
too
much
afraid
of
scandal
which
might
annoy
her
husband
she
is
deeply
in
awe
of
lord
walderhurst
and
deeply
in
love
with
him
when
one
realises
how
unnecessary
qualities
and
charms
seem
to
be
to
the
awakening
of
the
tender
emotion
it
is
rather
dull
perhaps
to
ask
why
yet
one
weakly
asks
it
was
warren
summation
and
one
can
not
supply
the
answer
but
the
mere
devotion
itself
in
this
nice
creature
is
a
thing
to
be
respected
she
will
control
even
her
anxieties
and
reveal
nothing
while
she
writes
her
cheerful
letters
as
soon
as
she
is
allowed
to
write
them
lord
walderhurst
will
be
told
nothing
nothing
until
his
recovery
is
complete
now
that
she
has
made
a
clean
breast
of
everything
to
me
and
given
herself
into
my
hands
i
believe
that
she
finds
a
sentimental
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
keeping
her
secret
until
he
returns
i
will
confess
to
you
mary
that
i
think
that
she
has
read
of
and
tenderly
sympathised
with
heroines
who
have
done
the
like
before
she
does
not
pose
to
herself
as
a
heroine
but
she
dwells
affectionately
on
ingenuous
mental
pictures
of
what
lord
walderhurst
will
say
it
is
just
as
well
that
it
should
be
so
it
is
better
for
her
than
fretting
would
be
experience
helped
me
to
gather
from
the
medical
man
letter
that
his
patient
is
in
no
condition
to
be
told
news
of
any
kind
good
or
bad
the
house
in
berkeley
square
was
reopened
lady
walderhurst
returned
to
it
as
it
was
understood
below
stairs
from
a
visit
to
some
german
health
resort
cupp
and
jane
returned
with
her
the
wife
of
her
physician
in
attendance
was
with
her
a
great
deal
it
was
most
unfortunate
for
her
ladyship
that
my
lord
was
detained
in
india
by
illness
the
great
household
having
presented
opened
shutters
to
the
world
went
on
in
the
even
tenor
of
its
way
there
brooded
over
it
however
a
sort
of
hushed
dignity
of
atmosphere
the
very
housemaids
wore
an
air
of
grave
discretion
their
labours
assumed
the
proportions
of
confidential
interested
service
in
which
they
felt
a
private
pride
not
one
among
them
had
escaped
becoming
attached
to
lady
walderhurst
away
from
palstrey
away
from
mortimer
street
emily
began
to
find
reality
in
the
fact
that
everything
had
already
become
quite
simple
after
all
the
fine
rooms
looked
so
well
ordered
and
decent
in
a
stately
way
melodramatic
plotting
ceased
to
exist
as
she
looked
at
certain
dignified
sofas
and
impressive
candelabra
such
things
became
even
more
impossible
than
they
had
become
before
the
convincingness
of
the
first
floor
front
bedroom
in
mortimer
street
she
began
to
give
a
good
deal
of
thought
to
the
summer
at
mallowe
there
was
an
extraordinary
luxury
in
living
again
each
day
of
it
the
morning
when
she
had
taken
the
carriage
which
provided
her
with
hot
labouring
men
in
corduroys
as
companions
that
fleeting
moment
when
the
tall
man
with
the
square
face
had
passed
the
carriage
and
looked
straight
through
her
without
seeming
to
see
her
at
all
she
sat
and
smiled
tenderly
at
the
mere
reminiscent
thought
and
then
the
glimpse
of
him
as
he
got
into
the
high
phaeton
at
the
station
and
the
moment
when
lady
maria
had
exclaimed
there
walderhurst
and
he
had
come
swinging
with
his
leisurely
step
across
the
lawn
and
he
had
scarcely
seemed
to
see
her
then
or
notice
her
really
when
they
met
until
the
morning
he
had
joined
her
as
she
gathered
the
roses
and
had
talked
to
her
about
lady
agatha
but
he
had
actually
been
noticing
her
a
little
even
from
the
first
he
had
been
thinking
about
her
a
little
all
the
time
and
how
far
she
had
been
from
guessing
it
when
she
had
talked
to
lady
agatha
how
pleased
she
had
been
the
morning
of
the
rose
gathering
when
he
had
seemed
interested
only
in
agatha
self
she
always
liked
to
recall
however
the
way
in
which
he
had
asked
the
few
questions
about
her
own
affairs
her
simplicity
never
wearied
of
the
fascination
of
the
way
in
which
he
had
looked
at
her
standing
on
the
pathway
with
that
delightful
fixing
of
her
with
the
monocle
when
she
had
said
people
kind
you
see
i
have
nothing
to
give
and
i
always
seem
to
be
receiving
and
he
had
gazed
at
her
quite
unmovedly
and
answered
only
what
luck
but
since
then
he
had
mentioned
this
moment
as
one
of
those
in
which
he
had
felt
that
he
might
want
to
marry
her
because
she
was
so
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
she
gave
much
more
to
everybody
than
she
received
that
she
had
so
much
to
give
and
was
totally
unaware
of
the
value
of
her
gifts
his
thoughts
of
me
are
so
very
often
was
her
favourite
reflection
though
he
always
has
that
composed
way
of
saying
things
what
he
says
seems
more
because
he
is
like
that
in
truth
his
composed
way
of
saying
things
it
was
which
seemed
to
her
incomparable
even
when
without
understanding
its
own
longing
for
a
thing
it
lacked
her
heart
had
felt
itself
a
little
unsustained
she
had
never
ceased
to
feel
the
fascination
of
his
entire
freedom
from
any
shadow
of
interest
in
the
mental
attitude
of
others
towards
himself
when
he
stood
and
gazed
at
people
through
the
glass
neatly
screwed
into
his
eye
one
felt
that
it
was
he
whose
opinion
was
of
importance
not
the
other
person
through
sheer
chill
imperviousness
he
seemed
entirely
detached
from
the
powers
of
criticism
what
people
said
or
thought
of
his
fixed
opinion
on
a
subject
was
not
of
the
least
consequence
in
fact
did
not
exist
the
entities
of
the
persons
who
cavilled
at
such
opinions
themselves
ceased
to
exist
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
his
was
the
immovable
temperament
he
did
not
snub
people
he
cut
the
cord
of
mental
communication
with
them
and
dropped
them
into
space
emily
thought
this
firmness
and
reserved
dignity
and
quailed
before
the
thought
of
erring
in
such
a
manner
as
would
cause
him
to
so
send
her
soul
adrift
her
greatest
terror
during
the
past
months
had
been
the
fear
of
making
him
ridiculous
of
putting
him
in
some
position
which
might
annoy
him
by
objectionable
publicity
but
now
she
had
no
further
fears
and
could
wait
in
safety
and
dwell
in
peace
upon
her
memories
and
her
hopes
she
even
began
to
gain
a
kind
of
courage
in
her
thoughts
of
him
the
atmosphere
of
the
berkeley
square
mansion
was
good
for
her
she
had
never
felt
so
much
its
mistress
before
the
staff
of
servants
of
whose
existence
she
was
the
centre
who
so
plainly
served
her
with
careful
pleasure
who
considered
her
least
wish
or
inclination
as
a
royal
command
increased
her
realisation
of
her
security
and
power
the
warrens
who
understood
the
dignity
and
meaning
of
mere
worldly
facts
her
nature
did
not
grasp
added
subtly
to
her
support
gradually
she
learned
to
reveal
herself
in
simple
talk
to
warren
who
found
her
when
so
revealed
a
case
more
extraordinary
than
she
had
been
when
enshrouded
in
dubious
mystery
she
is
absolutely
delicious
warren
said
to
her
husband
that
an
adoration
such
as
hers
could
exist
in
the
nineteenth
century
is
almost
degenerate
he
laughed
perhaps
it
is
regenerate
reflecting
who
knows
nothing
earthly
or
heavenly
would
induce
me
to
cast
a
doubt
upon
it
seated
opposite
to
a
portrait
of
her
james
i
hear
her
opinions
of
him
when
she
is
not
in
the
least
aware
of
what
her
simplest
observation
conveys
she
does
not
know
that
she
is
including
him
when
she
is
talking
of
other
things
that
one
sees
that
while
she
is
too
shy
to
openly
use
his
name
much
the
very
breath
of
her
life
is
a
reference
to
him
her
greatest
bliss
at
present
is
to
go
unobtrusively
into
his
special
rooms
and
sit
there
dwelling
upon
his
goodness
to
her
in
fact
emily
spent
many
a
quiet
hour
in
the
apartments
she
had
visited
on
the
day
of
her
farewell
to
her
husband
she
was
very
happy
there
her
soul
was
uplifted
by
her
gratitude
for
the
peace
she
had
reached
the
reports
of
lord
walderhurst
physician
were
never
alarming
and
generally
of
a
reassuring
nature
but
she
knew
that
he
must
exercise
great
caution
and
that
time
must
elapse
before
he
could
confront
his
return
voyage
he
would
come
back
as
soon
as
was
quite
safe
and
in
the
meantime
her
world
held
all
that
she
could
desire
lacking
himself
her
emotion
expressed
itself
in
her
earnest
performance
of
her
reverent
daily
devotions
she
read
many
chapters
of
the
bible
and
often
sat
happily
absorbed
in
the
study
of
her
book
of
common
prayer
she
found
solace
and
happiness
in
such
things
and
spent
her
sunday
mornings
after
the
ringing
of
the
church
bells
quite
alone
in
study
following
the
service
and
reading
the
collects
and
lessons
the
room
used
to
seem
so
beautifully
still
even
berkeley
square
wearing
its
aspect
suggested
devout
aloofness
from
worldly
things
i
sit
at
the
window
and
she
explained
to
warren
it
is
so
nice
there
she
wrote
her
letters
to
india
in
this
room
she
did
not
know
how
far
the
new
courage
in
her
thoughts
of
her
husband
expressed
itself
in
these
letters
when
walderhurst
read
them
however
he
felt
a
sense
of
change
in
her
women
were
sometimes
spoken
of
as
coming
out
amazingly
he
began
to
feel
that
emily
was
in
a
measure
at
least
coming
out
perhaps
her
gradually
increasing
feeling
of
accustomedness
to
the
change
in
her
life
was
doing
it
for
her
she
said
more
in
her
letters
and
said
it
in
a
more
interesting
way
it
was
perhaps
rather
suggestive
of
the
development
of
a
girl
who
was
on
the
verge
of
becoming
a
delightful
sort
of
woman
lying
upon
his
back
in
bed
rendered
it
may
be
a
trifle
susceptible
by
the
weakness
of
slow
convalescence
he
found
a
certain
habit
growing
upon
him
a
habit
of
reading
her
letters
several
times
and
of
thinking
of
her
as
it
had
not
been
his
nature
to
think
of
women
also
he
slowly
awakened
to
an
interest
in
the
arrival
of
the
english
mails
the
letters
actually
raised
his
spirits
and
had
an
excellent
physical
effect
his
doctor
always
found
him
in
good
condition
after
he
had
heard
from
his
wife
your
letters
my
dear
emily
walderhurst
once
wrote
are
a
great
pleasure
to
me
you
are
exactly
as
you
were
at
mallowe
the
creature
of
amiable
good
cheer
your
comfort
stimulates
me
how
how
emily
cried
to
the
silence
of
the
study
and
kissed
the
letter
with
impassioned
happiness
illustration
lady
maria
bayne
the
next
epistle
went
even
farther
it
absolutely
contained
things
and
referred
to
the
past
which
it
was
her
joy
to
pour
libations
before
in
secret
thought
when
her
eye
caught
the
phrase
the
days
at
mallowe
in
the
middle
of
a
sheet
she
was
almost
frightened
at
the
rush
of
pleasure
which
swept
over
her
men
who
were
less
aloof
from
sentimental
moods
used
such
phrases
in
letters
she
had
read
and
heard
it
was
almost
as
if
he
had
said
the
dear
old
days
at
mallowe
or
the
happy
days
at
mallowe
and
the
rapture
of
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
bear
i
can
not
help
remembering
as
i
lie
here
she
read
in
actual
letters
as
she
went
on
of
the
many
thoughts
which
passed
through
my
mind
as
i
drove
over
the
heath
to
pick
you
up
i
had
been
watching
you
for
days
i
always
liked
particularly
your
clear
large
eyes
i
recall
trying
to
describe
them
to
myself
and
finding
it
difficult
they
seemed
to
me
then
to
resemble
something
between
the
eyes
of
a
very
nice
boy
and
the
eyes
of
a
delightful
this
may
not
appear
so
romantic
a
comparison
as
it
really
is
emily
began
most
softly
and
sweetly
to
cry
nothing
more
romantic
could
she
possibly
have
imagined
i
thought
of
them
in
spite
of
myself
as
i
drove
across
the
moor
and
i
could
scarcely
express
to
you
how
angry
i
was
at
maria
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
had
brutally
imposed
on
you
only
because
she
had
known
she
might
impose
on
a
woman
with
such
a
pair
of
eyes
i
was
angry
and
sentimental
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
to
find
you
sitting
by
the
wayside
absolutely
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
in
tears
moved
me
really
more
than
i
had
anticipated
being
moved
and
when
you
mistook
my
meaning
and
stood
up
your
nice
eyes
looking
into
mine
in
such
ingenuous
appeal
and
fear
and
trouble
i
have
never
forgotten
it
my
dear
and
i
never
shall
his
mood
of
sentiment
did
not
sit
easily
upon
him
but
it
meant
a
real
and
interesting
quite
human
thing
emily
sat
alone
in
the
room
and
brooded
over
it
as
a
mother
might
brood
over
a
child
she
was
full
of
tremulous
bliss
and
dwelling
with
reverent
awe
upon
the
wonder
of
great
things
drawing
nearer
to
her
every
hour
wept
for
happiness
as
she
sat
the
same
afternoon
lady
maria
bayne
arrived
she
had
been
abroad
taking
in
no
dull
fashion
various
cures
which
involved
drinking
mineral
waters
while
promenading
to
the
sounds
of
strains
of
outdoor
music
and
comparing
symptoms
wittily
with
friends
equal
to
amazing
repartee
in
connection
with
all
subjects
warren
was
an
old
acquaintance
and
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
house
as
she
entered
it
she
stopped
to
shake
hands
with
him
it
rather
unfortunate
for
a
man
when
one
can
only
be
glad
to
see
him
in
the
house
of
an
enemy
she
greeted
him
with
i
must
know
what
you
are
doing
here
it
not
possible
that
lady
walderhurst
is
fretting
herself
into
because
her
husband
chooses
to
have
a
fever
in
india
no
she
is
behaving
beautifully
in
all
respects
may
i
have
a
few
minutes
talk
with
you
lady
maria
before
you
see
her
a
few
minutes
talk
with
me
means
something
either
amusing
or
portentous
let
us
walk
into
the
she
led
the
way
with
a
rustle
of
silk
petticoats
and
a
suggestion
of
lifted
eyebrows
she
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
thing
sounded
more
portentous
than
amusing
thank
heaven
it
was
not
possible
for
emily
to
have
involved
herself
in
annoying
muddles
she
was
not
that
kind
of
woman
when
she
came
out
of
the
room
some
twenty
minutes
later
she
did
not
look
quite
like
herself
her
smart
bonnet
set
less
well
upon
her
delicate
little
old
face
and
she
was
agitated
and
cross
and
pleased
it
was
ridiculous
of
walderhurst
to
leave
her
she
was
saying
it
was
ridiculous
of
her
not
to
order
him
home
at
once
it
was
exactly
like
her
dear
and
ridiculous
in
spite
of
her
agitation
she
felt
a
little
grotesque
as
she
went
upstairs
to
see
emily
grotesque
because
she
was
obliged
to
admit
to
herself
that
she
had
never
felt
so
curiously
excited
in
her
life
she
felt
as
she
supposed
women
did
when
they
allowed
themselves
to
shed
tears
through
excitement
not
that
she
was
shedding
tears
but
she
was
upset
that
was
what
she
called
it
as
the
door
opened
emily
rose
from
a
chair
near
the
fire
and
came
slowly
towards
her
with
an
awkward
but
lovely
smile
lady
maria
made
a
quick
movement
forward
and
caught
hold
of
both
her
hands
my
good
emily
she
broke
forth
and
kissed
her
my
excellent
emily
and
kissed
her
again
i
am
completely
turned
upside
down
i
never
heard
such
an
insane
story
in
my
life
i
have
seen
warren
the
creatures
were
mad
it
is
all
over
said
emily
i
scarcely
believe
it
was
true
now
lady
maria
being
led
to
a
sofa
settled
herself
upon
it
still
wearing
her
complex
expression
of
crossness
agitation
and
pleasure
i
am
going
to
stay
here
she
said
obstinately
there
shall
be
no
more
folly
but
i
will
tell
you
that
they
have
gone
back
to
india
the
child
was
a
girl
it
was
a
girl
yes
absurdly
enough
oh
sighed
emily
sorrowfully
i
hester
was
to
write
to
me
rubbish
said
lady
maria
at
any
rate
as
i
remarked
before
i
am
going
to
stay
here
until
walderhurst
comes
back
the
man
will
be
quite
mad
with
gratified
vanity
chapter
twenty
three
it
was
a
damp
and
depressing
day
on
which
lord
walderhurst
arrived
in
london
as
his
carriage
turned
into
berkeley
square
he
sat
in
the
corner
of
it
rather
huddled
in
his
and
looking
pale
and
thin
he
was
wishing
that
london
had
chosen
to
show
a
more
exhilarating
countenance
to
him
but
he
himself
was
conscious
of
being
possessed
by
something
more
nearly
approaching
a
mood
of
eagerness
than
he
remembered
experiencing
at
any
period
of
his
previous
existence
he
had
found
the
voyage
home
long
and
had
been
restless
he
wanted
to
see
his
wife
how
agreeable
it
would
be
to
meet
when
he
looked
across
the
the
smile
in
her
happy
eyes
she
would
grow
pink
with
pleasure
like
a
girl
when
he
confessed
that
he
had
missed
her
he
was
curious
to
see
in
her
the
changes
he
had
felt
in
her
letters
having
time
and
opportunities
for
development
she
might
become
an
absolutely
delightful
companion
she
had
looked
very
handsome
on
the
day
of
her
presentation
at
court
her
height
and
carriage
had
made
her
even
impressive
she
was
a
woman
after
all
to
be
counted
on
in
one
plans
but
he
was
most
conscious
that
his
affection
for
her
had
warmed
a
slight
embarrassment
was
commingled
with
the
knowledge
but
that
was
the
natural
result
of
his
dislike
to
the
sentimental
he
had
never
felt
a
shadow
of
sentiment
for
audrey
who
had
been
an
extremely
light
dry
person
and
he
had
always
felt
she
had
been
adroitly
thrust
upon
him
by
their
united
families
he
had
not
liked
her
and
she
had
not
liked
him
it
had
been
very
stupidly
trying
and
the
child
had
not
lived
an
hour
he
had
liked
emily
from
the
first
and
now
it
was
an
absolute
truth
that
he
felt
a
slight
movement
in
the
cardiac
region
when
the
carriage
turned
into
berkeley
square
the
house
would
look
very
pleasant
when
he
entered
it
emily
would
in
some
subtle
way
have
arranged
that
it
should
wear
a
festal
greeting
air
she
had
a
number
of
nice
little
feminine
emotions
about
bright
fires
and
many
flowers
he
could
picture
her
childlike
face
as
it
would
look
when
he
stepped
into
the
room
where
they
met
some
one
was
ill
in
berkeley
square
evidently
very
ill
straw
was
laid
thick
all
along
one
side
of
it
depressing
damp
fresh
straw
over
which
the
carriage
rolled
with
a
dull
drag
of
the
wheels
it
lay
before
the
door
of
his
own
house
he
observed
as
he
stepped
out
it
was
very
thickly
scattered
the
door
swung
open
as
the
carriage
stopped
crossing
the
threshold
he
glanced
at
the
face
of
the
footman
nearest
to
him
the
man
looked
like
a
mute
at
a
funeral
and
the
expression
was
so
little
in
accord
with
his
mood
that
he
stopped
with
a
feeling
of
irritation
he
had
not
time
to
speak
however
before
a
new
sensation
arrested
his
attention
a
faint
odour
which
filled
the
place
the
house
smells
like
a
hospital
he
exclaimed
in
great
annoyance
what
does
it
mean
the
man
he
addressed
did
not
answer
he
turned
a
perturbed
awkward
face
to
his
superior
in
rank
an
older
man
who
was
house
steward
in
the
house
of
mortal
pain
or
death
there
is
but
one
thing
more
full
of
suggestion
than
the
faint
smell
of
antiseptics
the
gruesome
cleanly
unpleasant
odour
that
is
the
unnatural
sound
of
the
whispering
of
hushed
voices
lord
walderhurst
turned
cold
and
felt
it
necessary
to
stiffen
his
spine
when
he
heard
his
servant
answer
and
the
tone
in
which
it
was
made
her
ladyship
my
lord
her
ladyship
is
very
low
the
doctors
do
not
leave
her
her
ladyship
the
man
stepped
back
deferentially
the
door
of
the
had
been
opened
and
old
lady
maria
bayne
stood
on
the
threshold
her
worldly
air
of
elderly
gaiety
had
disappeared
she
looked
a
hundred
she
was
almost
dilapidated
she
had
allowed
to
relax
themselves
the
springs
which
held
her
together
and
ordinarily
supplied
her
with
sprightly
movement
come
here
she
said
when
he
entered
the
room
aghast
she
shut
the
door
i
suppose
i
ought
to
break
it
to
you
gently
she
said
shakily
but
i
shall
do
no
such
thing
it
too
much
to
expect
of
any
woman
who
has
gone
through
what
i
have
during
these
last
three
days
the
creature
is
dying
she
may
be
dead
now
she
sank
on
the
sofa
and
began
to
wipe
away
pouring
tears
her
old
cheeks
were
pale
and
her
handkerchief
showed
touches
of
on
its
dampness
she
was
aware
of
their
presence
but
was
utterly
indifferent
walderhurst
stared
at
her
haggard
disorder
and
cleared
his
throat
finding
himself
unable
to
speak
without
doing
so
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
he
said
with
weird
stiffness
what
you
are
talking
about
about
emily
walderhurst
she
answered
the
boy
was
born
yesterday
and
she
has
been
sinking
ever
since
she
can
not
possibly
last
much
longer
she
he
gasped
turning
lead
colour
can
not
possibly
last
emily
the
wrench
and
shock
were
so
unnatural
that
they
reached
that
part
of
his
being
where
human
feeling
was
buried
under
selfishness
and
inhuman
conventionality
he
spoke
and
actually
thought
of
emily
first
lady
maria
continued
to
weep
shamelessly
i
am
over
seventy
she
said
and
the
last
three
days
have
punished
me
quite
enough
for
anything
i
may
have
done
since
i
was
born
i
have
been
in
hell
too
james
and
when
she
could
think
at
all
she
has
only
thought
of
you
and
your
miserable
child
i
ca
imagine
what
is
the
matter
with
a
woman
when
she
can
care
for
a
man
to
such
an
extent
now
she
has
what
she
wants
she
dying
for
you
why
was
i
told
he
asked
still
with
the
weird
and
slow
stiffness
because
she
was
a
sentimental
fool
and
was
afraid
of
disturbing
you
she
ought
to
have
ordered
you
home
and
kept
you
dancing
attendance
and
treated
you
to
hysterics
no
one
would
have
resented
such
a
course
of
action
more
derisively
than
lady
maria
herself
but
the
last
three
days
had
reduced
her
to
something
like
hysteria
and
she
had
entirely
lost
her
head
she
has
been
writing
cheerfully
to
me
she
would
have
written
cheerfully
to
you
if
she
had
been
seated
in
a
cauldron
of
boiling
oil
it
is
my
impression
broke
in
her
ladyship
she
has
been
monstrously
treated
people
trying
to
murder
her
and
she
afraid
to
accuse
them
for
fear
that
you
would
disapprove
you
know
you
have
a
nasty
manner
james
when
you
think
your
dignity
is
interfered
with
lord
walderhurst
stood
clenching
and
unclenching
his
hands
as
they
hung
by
his
sides
he
did
not
like
to
believe
that
his
fever
had
touched
his
brain
but
he
doubted
his
senses
hideously
my
good
maria
he
said
i
do
not
understand
a
word
you
say
but
i
must
go
and
see
her
and
kill
her
if
she
has
a
breath
left
you
will
not
stir
from
here
thank
heaven
here
is
dr
warren
the
door
had
opened
and
warren
came
in
he
had
just
laid
down
upon
the
coverlet
of
a
bed
upstairs
what
seemed
to
be
the
hand
of
a
dying
woman
and
no
man
like
himself
can
do
such
a
thing
and
enter
a
room
without
a
singular
look
on
his
face
people
in
a
house
of
death
inevitably
whisper
whatsoever
their
remoteness
from
the
lady
maria
cried
out
in
a
whisper
is
she
still
alive
yes
was
the
response
walderhurst
went
to
him
may
i
see
her
no
lord
walderhurst
not
yet
does
that
mean
that
it
is
not
yet
the
last
moment
if
that
moment
had
obviously
arrived
you
would
be
called
what
must
i
do
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
wait
brent
forsythe
and
blount
are
with
her
i
am
in
the
position
of
knowing
nothing
i
must
be
told
have
you
time
to
tell
me
they
went
to
walderhurst
study
the
room
which
had
been
emily
holy
of
holies
lady
walderhurst
was
very
fond
of
sitting
here
alone
warren
remarked
walderhurst
saw
that
she
must
have
written
letters
at
his
desk
her
own
pen
and
lay
on
it
she
had
probably
had
a
fancy
for
writing
her
letters
to
himself
in
his
own
chair
it
would
be
like
her
to
have
done
it
it
gave
him
a
shock
to
see
on
a
small
table
a
thimble
and
a
pair
of
scissors
i
ought
to
have
been
told
he
said
to
warren
warren
sat
down
and
explained
why
he
had
not
been
told
as
he
spoke
interest
was
awakened
in
his
mind
by
the
fact
that
lord
walderhurst
drew
towards
him
the
feminine
and
opened
and
shut
it
mechanically
what
i
want
to
know
he
said
is
if
i
shall
be
able
to
speak
to
her
i
should
like
to
speak
to
her
that
is
what
one
most
wants
was
warren
answer
at
such
a
time
you
think
i
may
not
be
able
to
make
her
understand
i
am
very
sorry
it
is
impossible
to
know
this
slowly
is
very
hard
on
me
there
is
something
i
feel
i
must
tell
you
lord
walderhurst
warren
kept
a
keen
eye
on
him
having
in
fact
felt
far
from
attracted
by
the
man
in
the
past
and
wondering
how
much
he
would
be
moved
by
certain
truths
or
if
he
would
be
moved
at
all
before
lady
walderhurst
illness
she
was
very
explicit
with
me
in
her
expression
of
her
one
desire
she
begged
me
to
give
her
my
word
which
i
could
not
have
done
without
your
permission
that
whatsoever
the
circumstances
if
life
must
be
sacrificed
it
should
be
hers
a
dusky
red
shot
through
walderhurst
leaden
pallor
she
asked
you
that
he
said
yes
and
at
the
worst
she
did
not
forget
when
she
became
delirious
and
we
heard
that
she
was
praying
i
gathered
that
she
seemed
to
be
praying
to
me
as
to
a
deity
whom
she
implored
to
remember
her
fervent
pleading
when
her
brain
was
clear
she
was
wonderful
she
saved
your
son
by
supernatural
endurance
you
mean
to
say
that
if
she
had
cared
more
for
herself
and
less
for
the
safety
of
the
child
she
need
not
have
been
as
she
is
now
warren
bent
his
head
lord
walderhurst
eyeglass
had
been
dangling
weakly
from
its
cord
he
picked
it
up
and
stuck
it
in
his
eye
to
stare
the
doctor
in
the
face
the
action
was
a
singular
spasmodic
hard
one
but
his
hands
were
shaking
by
god
he
cried
out
if
i
had
been
here
it
should
not
have
been
so
he
got
up
and
supported
himself
against
the
table
with
the
shaking
hands
it
is
very
plain
he
said
that
she
has
been
willing
to
be
torn
to
pieces
upon
the
rack
to
give
me
the
thing
i
wanted
and
now
good
god
in
heaven
i
feel
that
i
would
have
strangled
the
boy
with
my
own
hands
rather
than
lose
her
in
this
manner
it
seemed
did
a
rigid
and
conventional
elderly
nobleman
reach
emotion
he
looked
uncanny
his
stiff
dignity
hung
about
him
in
rags
and
tatters
cold
sweat
stood
on
his
forehead
and
his
chin
twitched
just
now
he
poured
forth
i
do
care
whether
there
is
a
child
or
not
i
want
her
i
care
for
nothing
else
i
want
to
look
at
her
i
want
to
speak
to
her
whether
she
is
alive
or
dead
but
if
there
is
a
spark
of
life
in
her
i
believe
she
will
hear
me
warren
sat
and
watched
him
wondering
he
knew
curious
things
of
the
human
creature
things
which
most
of
his
confrères
did
not
know
he
knew
that
life
was
a
mysterious
thing
and
that
even
a
dying
flame
of
it
might
sometimes
be
fanned
to
flickering
anew
by
powers
more
subtle
than
science
usually
regards
as
applicable
influences
he
knew
the
nature
of
the
woman
lying
on
her
bed
upstairs
and
he
comprehended
what
the
soul
of
her
life
had
been
her
divinely
innocent
passion
for
a
man
he
had
seen
it
in
the
tortured
courage
of
her
eyes
in
hours
of
mortal
agony
do
forget
she
had
said
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
do
let
anyone
forget
hallowed
be
thy
name
the
man
leaning
upon
his
shaking
hands
before
him
stood
there
for
these
moments
at
least
a
harrowed
thing
not
a
single
individual
of
his
acquaintance
would
have
known
him
i
want
to
see
her
before
the
breath
leaves
her
he
gave
forth
in
a
harsh
broken
whisper
i
want
to
speak
let
me
see
her
warren
left
his
chair
slowly
out
of
a
thousand
chances
against
her
might
this
one
chance
be
for
her
the
chance
of
her
hearing
and
being
called
back
to
the
shores
she
was
drifting
from
by
this
stiff
conventional
fellow
voice
there
was
no
knowing
the
wondrousness
of
a
loving
human
thing
even
when
its
shackles
were
loosening
themselves
to
set
it
free
i
will
speak
to
those
in
charge
with
me
he
said
will
you
control
every
outward
expression
of
feeling
yes
adjoining
lady
walderhurst
sleeping
apartment
was
a
small
boudoir
where
the
medical
men
consulted
together
two
of
them
were
standing
near
the
window
conversing
in
whispers
walderhurst
merely
nodded
and
went
to
wait
apart
by
the
fire
ceremony
had
ceased
to
exist
warren
joined
the
pair
at
the
window
lord
walderhurst
only
heard
one
or
two
sentences
i
am
afraid
that
nothing
now
can
matter
at
any
moment
those
who
do
not
know
from
experience
what
he
saw
when
he
entered
the
next
room
have
reason
to
give
thanks
to
such
powers
as
they
put
trust
in
there
ruled
in
the
large
dim
chamber
an
awful
order
and
silence
the
faint
flickering
of
the
fire
was
a
marked
sound
there
was
no
other
but
a
fainter
and
even
more
irregular
one
heard
as
one
neared
the
bed
sometimes
it
seemed
to
stop
then
with
a
weak
gasp
begin
again
a
nurse
in
uniform
stood
in
waiting
an
elderly
man
sat
on
a
chair
at
the
bedside
listening
and
looking
at
his
watch
something
white
and
lifeless
lying
in
his
grasp
emily
walderhurst
waxen
unmoving
hand
the
odour
of
antiseptics
filled
the
nostrils
lord
walderhurst
drew
near
the
speaking
sign
of
the
moment
was
that
neither
nurse
nor
doctor
stirred
emily
lay
low
upon
a
pillow
her
face
was
as
bloodless
as
wax
and
was
a
little
turned
aside
the
shadow
was
hovering
over
it
and
touched
her
closed
lids
and
the
droop
of
her
cheek
and
corners
of
her
mouth
she
was
far
far
away
this
was
what
walderhurst
felt
first
the
strange
remoteness
the
lonely
stillness
of
her
she
had
gone
alone
far
from
the
place
he
stood
in
and
which
they
two
familiarly
knew
she
was
going
alone
farther
still
as
he
stood
and
watched
her
closed
eyes
the
nice
easily
pleased
eyes
it
was
they
themselves
closed
on
him
and
all
prosaic
things
and
pleasures
which
filled
him
most
strangely
with
that
sense
of
her
loneliness
weirdly
enough
not
his
he
was
not
thinking
of
himself
but
of
her
he
wanted
to
withdraw
her
from
her
loneliness
to
bring
her
back
he
knelt
down
carefully
making
no
sound
stealthily
not
removing
his
eyes
from
her
strange
aloof
face
he
slowly
dared
to
close
his
hand
on
hers
which
lay
outside
the
coverlet
and
it
was
a
little
chill
and
damp
a
little
chill
a
power
a
force
which
hides
itself
in
human
things
and
which
most
of
them
know
not
of
was
gathering
within
him
he
was
warm
and
alive
a
living
man
his
hand
as
it
closed
on
the
chill
of
hers
was
warm
his
newly
awakened
being
sent
heat
to
it
he
whispered
her
name
close
to
her
ear
emily
slowly
emily
she
was
very
far
away
and
lay
unmoving
her
breast
scarcely
stirred
with
the
faintness
of
her
breath
emily
emily
the
doctor
slightly
raised
his
eyes
to
glance
at
him
he
was
used
to
scenes
but
this
was
curious
because
he
knew
the
usual
outward
aspect
of
lord
walderhurst
and
its
alteration
at
this
moment
suggested
abnormal
things
he
had
not
the
flexibility
of
mind
which
revealed
to
warren
that
there
were
perhaps
abnormal
moments
for
the
most
normal
and
inelastic
personages
emily
said
his
lordship
emily
he
did
not
cease
from
saying
it
in
a
low
yet
reaching
whisper
at
regular
intervals
for
at
least
half
an
hour
he
did
not
move
from
his
knees
and
so
intense
was
his
absorption
that
the
presence
of
those
who
came
near
was
as
nothing
what
he
hoped
or
intended
to
do
he
did
not
explain
to
himself
he
was
of
the
order
of
man
who
coldly
waves
aside
all
wanderings
on
the
subjects
of
occult
claims
he
believed
in
proven
facts
in
professional
aid
in
the
abolition
of
absurdities
but
his
whole
narrow
being
concentrated
itself
on
one
thing
he
wanted
this
woman
back
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
what
power
he
unknowingly
drew
from
the
depths
of
him
what
exquisite
answering
thing
he
reached
at
could
not
be
said
perhaps
it
was
only
some
remote
and
subtle
turn
of
the
tide
of
life
and
death
which
chanced
to
come
to
his
aid
emily
he
said
again
after
many
times
warren
at
this
moment
met
the
lifted
eyes
of
the
doctor
who
was
counting
her
pulse
and
in
response
to
his
look
went
to
him
it
seems
slightly
stronger
forsythe
whispered
the
slow
faint
breathing
changed
a
shade
there
was
heard
a
breath
slightly
very
slightly
deeper
less
flickering
then
another
lady
walderhurst
slightly
stirred
remain
where
you
are
whispered
warren
to
her
husband
and
continue
to
speak
to
her
do
not
alter
your
tone
go
on
emily
walderhurst
drifting
out
on
a
still
borderless
white
sea
sinking
gently
as
she
floated
sinking
in
peaceful
painlessness
deeper
and
deeper
in
her
drifting
until
the
soft
cool
water
lapped
her
lips
and
as
she
knew
without
fear
would
soon
cover
them
and
her
quiet
face
hiding
them
for
ever
heard
from
far
very
far
away
across
the
whiteness
floating
about
her
a
faint
sound
which
at
first
only
fell
upon
the
stillness
without
meaning
everything
but
the
silence
had
been
left
behind
aeons
ago
nothing
remained
but
the
soundless
white
sea
and
the
slow
drifting
and
sinking
as
one
swayed
it
was
more
than
sleep
this
still
peace
because
there
was
no
thought
of
waking
to
any
shore
but
the
sound
repeated
itself
again
again
again
and
again
monotonously
something
was
calling
to
something
she
was
so
given
up
to
the
soft
drifting
that
she
had
no
thoughts
to
give
and
gave
none
in
drifting
so
one
did
not
think
thought
was
left
in
the
place
the
white
sea
carried
one
from
she
sank
quietly
a
little
deeper
and
the
water
touched
her
lip
but
something
was
calling
to
something
something
was
calling
something
to
come
back
the
call
was
low
low
and
strange
so
regular
and
so
unbroken
and
insistent
that
it
arrested
she
knew
not
what
did
it
arrest
the
floating
and
the
swaying
in
the
enfolding
sea
was
the
drifting
slower
she
could
not
rouse
herself
to
think
she
wanted
to
go
on
did
she
no
longer
feel
the
water
lapping
against
her
lip
something
was
calling
to
something
still
once
aeons
ago
before
the
white
sea
had
borne
her
away
she
would
have
understood
emily
emily
emily
yes
once
she
would
have
known
what
the
sound
meant
once
it
had
meant
something
a
long
time
ago
it
had
even
now
disturbed
the
water
and
made
it
cease
to
lap
so
near
her
lip
it
was
at
this
moment
that
one
doctor
had
raised
his
eyes
to
the
other
and
lady
walderhurst
had
stirred
when
walderhurst
left
his
place
beside
his
wife
bed
warren
went
with
him
to
his
room
he
made
him
drink
brandy
and
called
his
man
to
him
you
must
remember
he
said
that
you
are
an
invalid
yourself
i
believe
was
the
sole
answer
given
with
an
abstracted
knitting
of
the
brows
i
believe
that
in
some
mysterious
way
i
have
made
her
hear
me
warren
looked
grave
he
was
a
deeply
interested
man
he
felt
that
he
had
been
looking
on
at
an
almost
incomprehensible
thing
yes
was
his
reply
i
believe
that
you
have
about
an
hour
later
lord
walderhurst
made
his
way
downstairs
to
the
room
in
which
lady
maria
bayne
sat
she
still
looked
a
hundred
years
old
but
her
maid
had
redressed
her
toupee
and
given
her
a
handkerchief
neither
damp
nor
tinted
with
rouge
she
looked
at
her
relative
a
shade
more
leniently
but
still
addressed
him
with
something
of
the
manner
of
a
person
undeservedly
chained
to
a
malefactor
her
irritation
was
not
modified
by
the
circumstance
that
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
be
definite
in
the
expression
of
her
condemnation
of
things
which
had
made
her
hideously
uncomfortable
having
quite
approved
of
his
going
to
india
in
the
first
place
it
was
not
easy
to
go
thoroughly
into
the
subject
of
the
numerous
reasons
why
a
man
of
his
years
and
responsibilities
ought
to
have
realised
that
it
was
his
duty
to
remain
at
home
and
take
care
of
his
wife
incredible
as
it
seems
she
snapped
the
doctors
there
is
a
slight
change
for
the
better
yes
walderhurst
answered
he
leaned
against
the
mantel
and
gazed
into
the
fire
she
will
come
back
he
added
in
a
monotone
lady
maria
stared
at
him
she
felt
that
the
man
was
eerie
walderhurst
of
all
men
on
earth
where
do
you
think
she
has
been
she
professed
to
make
the
inquiry
with
an
air
of
reproof
how
should
one
know
rather
with
the
old
stiffness
it
is
impossible
to
tell
lady
maria
bayne
was
not
the
person
possessing
the
temperament
to
incline
him
to
explain
that
wheresoever
the
outer
sphere
might
be
to
which
the
dying
woman
had
been
drifting
he
had
been
following
her
as
far
as
living
man
could
go
the
elderly
house
steward
opened
the
door
and
spoke
in
the
hollow
whisper
the
head
nurse
wished
to
know
if
your
ladyship
would
be
so
good
as
to
see
lord
oswyth
before
he
goes
to
sleep
walderhurst
turned
his
head
towards
the
man
lord
oswyth
was
the
name
of
his
son
he
felt
a
shock
i
will
come
to
the
nursery
answered
lady
maria
you
have
not
seen
him
yet
turning
to
walderhurst
how
could
i
then
you
had
better
come
now
if
she
becomes
conscious
and
has
life
enough
to
expect
anything
she
will
expect
you
to
burst
forth
into
praises
of
him
you
had
better
at
least
commit
to
memory
the
colour
of
his
eyes
and
hair
i
believe
he
has
two
hairs
he
is
a
huge
fat
overgrown
thing
with
enormous
cheeks
when
i
saw
his
bloated
look
yesterday
i
confess
i
wanted
to
slap
him
her
description
was
not
wholly
accurate
but
he
was
a
large
and
robust
child
as
walderhurst
saw
when
he
beheld
him
from
kneeling
at
the
pillow
on
which
the
bloodless
statue
lay
and
calling
into
space
to
the
soul
which
would
not
hear
it
was
a
far
cry
to
the
warmed
and
lighted
room
in
which
life
had
begun
there
was
the
bright
fire
before
which
the
high
brass
nursery
fender
shone
there
was
soft
linen
hanging
to
be
warmed
there
was
a
cradle
swinging
in
its
place
and
in
a
basket
silver
and
gold
boxes
and
velvet
brushes
and
sponges
such
as
he
knew
nothing
about
he
had
not
been
in
such
a
place
before
and
felt
awkward
and
yet
in
secret
abnormally
moved
or
it
seemed
abnormally
to
him
two
women
were
in
attendance
one
of
them
held
in
her
arms
what
he
had
come
to
see
it
was
moving
slightly
in
its
coverings
of
white
its
bearer
stood
waiting
in
respectful
awe
as
lady
maria
uncovered
its
face
look
at
it
she
said
concealing
her
relieved
elation
under
a
slightly
caustic
manner
how
you
will
relish
the
situation
when
emily
tells
you
that
he
is
like
you
i
ca
be
as
sure
as
i
should
be
of
myself
under
the
same
circumstances
walderhurst
applied
his
monocle
and
gazed
for
some
moments
at
the
object
before
him
he
had
not
known
that
men
experienced
these
curiously
unexplainable
emotions
at
such
times
he
kept
a
strong
hold
on
himself
would
you
like
to
hold
him
inquired
lady
maria
she
was
conscious
of
a
benevolent
effort
to
restrain
the
irony
in
her
voice
lord
walderhurst
made
a
slight
movement
backward
i
i
should
not
know
how
he
said
and
then
felt
angry
at
himself
he
desired
to
take
the
thing
in
his
arms
he
desired
to
feel
its
warmth
he
absolutely
realised
that
if
he
had
been
alone
with
it
he
should
have
laid
aside
his
eyeglass
and
touched
its
cheek
with
his
lips
two
days
afterwards
he
was
sitting
by
his
wife
pillow
watching
her
shut
lids
when
he
saw
them
quiver
and
slowly
move
until
they
were
wide
open
her
eyes
looked
very
large
in
her
colourless
more
sharply
chiselled
face
they
saw
him
and
him
only
as
light
came
gradually
into
them
they
did
not
move
but
rested
on
him
he
bent
forward
almost
afraid
to
stir
he
spoke
to
her
as
he
had
spoken
before
emily
very
low
emily
her
voice
was
only
a
fluttering
breath
but
she
answered
it
was
you
she
said
chapter
twenty
four
such
individuals
as
had
not
already
thought
it
expedient
to
gradually
loosen
and
drop
the
links
of
their
acquaintance
with
captain
alec
osborn
did
not
find
on
his
return
to
his
duties
in
india
that
the
leave
of
absence
spent
in
england
among
his
relatives
had
improved
him
he
was
plainly
consuming
enormous
quantities
of
brandy
and
was
steadily
going
physically
and
mentally
to
seed
he
had
put
on
flesh
and
even
his
always
dubious
good
looks
were
rapidly
deserting
him
the
heavy
young
jowl
looked
less
young
and
more
pronounced
and
he
bore
about
an
evil
countenance
disappointment
may
have
played
the
devil
with
him
it
was
said
by
an
elderly
observer
but
he
has
played
the
devil
with
himself
he
was
a
to
begin
with
when
hester
people
flocked
to
see
her
and
hear
her
stories
of
exalted
life
in
england
they
greeted
her
with
exclamations
of
dismay
if
osborn
had
lost
his
looks
she
also
had
lost
hers
she
was
yellow
and
haggard
and
her
eyes
looked
she
had
not
improved
in
the
matter
of
temper
and
answered
all
effusive
questions
with
a
dry
bitter
little
smile
the
baby
she
had
brought
back
was
a
puny
ugly
and
tiny
girl
hester
dry
little
smile
when
she
exhibited
her
to
her
relations
was
not
pretty
she
saved
herself
disappointment
by
being
a
girl
she
remarked
at
all
events
she
knows
from
the
outset
that
no
one
can
rob
her
of
the
chance
of
being
the
marquis
of
walderhurst
it
was
rumoured
that
ugly
things
went
on
in
the
osborn
bungalow
it
was
known
that
scenes
occurred
between
the
husband
and
wife
which
were
not
of
the
order
admitted
as
among
the
methods
of
polite
society
one
evening
osborn
walked
slowly
down
the
mall
dressed
in
her
best
gown
and
hat
and
bearing
on
her
cheek
a
broad
purpling
mark
when
asked
questions
she
merely
smiled
and
made
no
answer
which
was
extremely
awkward
for
the
inquirer
the
questioner
was
the
wife
of
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
and
when
the
lady
related
the
incident
to
her
husband
in
the
evening
he
drew
in
his
breath
sharply
and
summed
the
situation
up
in
a
few
words
that
little
woman
he
said
lives
every
day
through
hours
of
hell
one
can
see
it
in
her
eyes
even
when
she
professes
to
smile
at
the
brute
for
decency
sake
the
awfulness
of
a
woman
forced
smile
at
the
devil
she
is
tied
to
loathing
him
and
bearing
in
her
soul
the
thing
blood
itself
could
not
wipe
out
ugh
i
seen
it
once
before
and
i
recognised
it
in
her
again
there
will
be
a
bad
end
to
this
there
probably
would
have
been
with
the
aid
of
unlimited
brandy
and
unrestrained
devil
some
outbreak
so
gross
that
the
social
laws
which
rule
men
who
are
officers
and
gentlemen
could
not
have
ignored
or
overlooked
it
but
the
end
came
in
an
unexpected
way
and
osborn
was
saved
from
open
ignominy
by
an
accident
on
a
certain
day
when
he
had
drunk
heavily
and
had
shut
hester
up
with
him
for
an
hour
torture
after
leaving
her
writhing
and
suffocating
with
sobs
he
went
to
examine
some
newly
bought
firearms
in
twenty
minutes
it
was
he
who
lay
upon
the
floor
writhing
and
suffocating
and
but
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
a
dead
man
a
charge
from
a
gun
he
had
believed
unloaded
had
finished
him
lady
walderhurst
was
the
kindest
of
women
as
the
world
knew
she
sent
for
little
osborn
and
her
child
and
was
tender
goodness
itself
to
them
hester
had
been
in
england
four
years
and
lord
oswyth
had
a
brother
as
robust
as
himself
when
one
heavenly
summer
afternoon
as
the
two
women
sat
on
the
lawn
drinking
little
cups
of
tea
hester
made
a
singular
revelation
and
made
it
without
moving
a
muscle
of
her
small
countenance
i
always
intended
to
tell
you
emily
she
began
quietly
and
i
will
tell
you
now
what
dear
said
emily
holding
out
to
her
a
plate
of
tiny
buttered
scones
have
some
of
these
nice
little
hot
ones
thank
you
hester
took
one
of
the
nice
little
hot
ones
but
did
not
begin
to
eat
it
instead
she
held
it
untouched
and
let
her
eyes
rest
on
the
brilliant
flower
terraces
spread
out
below
what
i
meant
to
tell
you
was
this
the
gun
was
not
loaded
the
gun
alec
shot
himself
with
when
he
laid
it
aside
emily
put
down
her
hastily
i
saw
him
take
out
the
charge
myself
two
hours
before
when
he
came
in
mad
with
drink
and
made
me
go
into
the
room
with
him
ameerah
saw
him
she
always
listened
outside
before
we
left
the
kennel
farm
the
day
he
tortured
and
taunted
me
until
i
lost
my
head
and
shrieked
out
to
him
that
i
had
told
you
what
i
knew
and
had
helped
you
to
go
away
he
struck
me
again
and
again
ameerah
heard
that
he
did
it
several
times
afterwards
and
she
always
knew
she
always
intended
to
end
it
in
some
way
she
knew
how
drunk
he
was
that
last
day
and
it
was
she
who
went
in
and
loaded
the
gun
while
he
was
having
his
scene
with
me
she
knew
he
would
go
and
begin
to
pull
the
things
about
without
having
the
sense
to
know
what
he
was
doing
she
had
seen
him
do
it
before
i
know
it
was
she
who
put
the
load
in
we
have
never
uttered
a
word
to
each
other
about
it
but
i
know
she
did
it
and
that
she
knows
i
know
before
i
married
alec
i
did
not
understand
how
one
human
being
could
kill
another
he
taught
me
to
understand
quite
but
i
had
not
the
courage
to
do
it
myself
ameerah
had
and
while
lady
walderhurst
sat
gazing
