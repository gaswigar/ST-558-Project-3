the

of
the

of

is
a
very
definite
one
they
desire
above
all
things
that
in
their
humble

these

shall
be
the
ambassadors
of
and
understanding
between
east
and
west
the
old
world
of

and
the
new
of
action
in
this
endeavour
and
in
their
own
sphere
they
are
but
followers
of
the
highest
example
in
the
land
they
are
confident
that
a
deeper
knowledge
of
the
great
ideals
and
lofty
philosophy
of
oriental
thought
may
help
to
a
revival
of
that
true

of

neither

introduction
i
the
origin
of
súfíism
among
the
mohammedans
súfíism
or
persian
mysticism
is
known
as
the
word
sidi
is
derived
from
meaning
wool
when
a
little
persian
sect
at
the
end
of
the
eighth
century
broke
away
from
the
orthodox
muslim
religion
and
struck
out
on
an
independent
path
they
ignored
costly
robes
and
worldly
ostentation
and
clad
themselves
in
a
white
wool
garment
hence
they
were
known
as
wool
wearers
or
súfís
edward
browne
gives
four
theories
in
regard
to
the
origin
of
súfíism
viz
doctrine
of
the
of
the
aryan
mind
against
a
semitic
neither
of
the
four
theories
altogether
satisfies
the
learned
professor
and
very
certain
it
is
that
the
theory
is
of
very
little
account
browne
seems
in
favour
of
a
spontaneous
growth
existing
in
various
forms
under
various
names
throughout
the
civilised
world
but
after
all
this
is
not
very
tangible
evidence
moreover
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
philosophers
paid
a
visit
to
the
persian
court
in
the
sixth
century
and
founded
a
school
there
in
the
reign
of
it
is
highly
probable
therefore
that
these
seven
philosophers
forced
to
leave
their
homes
through
the
tyranny
of
justinian
who
forbade
the
teaching
of
philosophy
at
athens
should
have
had
considerable
influence
upon
a
few
of
the
more
thoughtful
persians
we
shall
now
find
that
this
theory
is
borne
out
by
internal
evidence
let
us
briefly
study
the
tenets
of
the
believed
in
the
supreme
good
as
the
source
of
all
things
it
generated
from
itself
creation
was
the
reflection
of
its
own
being
nature
therefore
was
permeated
with
god
matter
was
essentially
a
temporary
and
shadow
for
the
embodiment
of
the
divine
the
believed
that
by
ecstasy
and
contemplation
of
the
man
would
rise
to
that
source
from
whence
he
came
these
points
bear
directly
upon
the
súfí
teaching
they
form
a
broad
outline
of
the
tenets
of
súfíism
the
súfís
from
temperamental
and
other
causes
elaborated
these
ideas
gave
them
a
rich
and
beautiful
setting
and
what
is
built
about
them
one
of
the
most
interesting
phases
of
mystical
poetry
the
world
has
ever
known
and
this
particular
phase
may
be
said
to
date
from
the
twelfth
century
thus
i
think
it
will
be
readily
admitted
that
the
súfís
certainly
owed
something
to
the
the
cry
for
the
beloved
was
in
their
hearts
before
the
greek
philosophers
came
but
appealed
to
their
oriental
minds
it
was
a
across
the
river
of
their
particular
spiritual
tendencies
and
they
trod
thereon
and
proceeded
to
lay
down
other
stones
across
the
stream
i
have
pointed
out
the
similarities
between
this
particular
greek
and
persian
belief
there
was
however
one
very
important
difference
the
conception
of
god
was
purely
abstract
the
essentially
personal
as
far
as
the
early
súfís
were
concerned
we
shall
consider
other
influences
which
were
brought
to
bear
upon
súfíism
a
little
later
on
there
is
a
very
great
difference
between
the
early
súfíism
and
the
elaborate
additions
that
followed
as
an
evolutionary
matter
of
course
in
brief
then
was
the
doctrine
of
ecstasy
a
quotation
from
the
letter
of
plotinus
to
flaccus
on
ecstasy
will
still
further
show
the
similarities
between
this
greek
and
persian
teaching
the
wise
man
recognises
the
idea
of
the
good
within
him
this
he
develops
by
withdrawal
into
the
holy
place
of
his
own
soul
he
who
does
not
understand
how
the
soul
contains
the
beautiful
within
itself
seeks
to
realise
beauty
without
by
laborious
production
his
aim
should
rather
be
to
concentrate
and
simplify
and
so
to
expand
his
being
instead
of
going
out
into
the
manifold
to
forsake
it
for
the
one
and
so
to
float
upwards
towards
the
divine
fount
of
being
whose
stream
flows
within
him
this
is
súfíism
in
prose
the
súfí
turned
the
same
conception
into
ii
the
early
súfís
abú
hashím
ob
was
the
first
to
bear
the
name
of
súfí
while
may
be
said
to
have
given
súfíism
its
permanent
shape
of
basra
was
the
first
woman
to
join
the
sect
and
her
saintliness
and
wise
sayings
have
been
preserved
by
one
day
a
great
sickness
fell
upon
and
on
being
asked
the
reason
for
it
she
replied
i
dwelt
upon
the
joys
of
paradise
and
therefore
my
beloved
has
chastened
me
did
not
believe
in
earthly
marriage
her
remark
on
the
subject
is
given
as
follows
the
bonds
of
wedlock
have
descended
upon
me
i
am
not
my
own
but
my
lord
and
must
not
be
unfaithful
to
him
also
informs
us
that
when
was
asked
if
she
hated
the
devil
she
replied
my
love
to
god
leaves
me
no
time
to
hate
him
was
a
woman
of
much
independence
of
thought
ethical
rather
than
metaphysical
in
her
remarks
and
strongly
opposed
to
outward
ceremonials
she
is
said
to
have
died
at
jerusalem
it
was
at
ramla
in
palestine
that
a
christian
nobleman
built
a
convent
for
the
súfís
thus
in
the
early
days
the
sect
defied
their
prophet
condemnation
of
monkery
by
building
an
abode
for
members
of
the
order
the
súfís
were
strongly
opposed
to
the
idea
of
or
distinct
and
personality
apart
from
the
beloved
the
orthodox
muslim
idea
was
precisely
the
reverse
the
súfís
have
always
made
the
koran
their
with
infinite
licence
they
ingeniously
quote
therefrom
and
still
more
ingeniously
add
their
own
explanations
when
necessary
no
doubt
there
were
political
reasons
for
adopting
this
method
of
concealing
heterodox
ideas
under
the
cloak
of
orthodoxy
we
shall
see
however
as
the
sect
grew
and
still
further
broadened
its
views
that
these
clever
compromises
did
not
prevent
the
appearance
of
martyrs
among
their
number
in
the
future
by
the
end
of
the
second
century
of
the
hijira
the
súfís
were
a
religious
order
in
the
following
century
quietism
had
not
only
changed
to
pantheism
but
pantheism
had
kindled
a
belief
that
beloved
and
lover
were
identical
the
step
was
inevitable
and
at
this
juncture
it
was
that
súfíism
became
essentially
mystical
and
it
became
more
mystical
as
years
advanced
about
this
time
the
beginning
of
the
third
century
we
come
across
two
interesting
súfís
who
seem
to
have
been
the
prime
movers
in
this
new
development
by
name
bayázíd
and
mansur
concerning
the
saint
bayázíd
an
interesting
story
is
told
in
the
fourth
book
of
the
the
saint
surprised
his
disciples
one
day
by
saying
lo
i
myself
am
god
almighty
there
is
no
god
beside
me
worship
me
the
disciples
thinking
their
master
was
beside
himself
told
him
when
the
strange
ecstasy
had
passed
what
he
had
said
bayázíd
promptly
replied
if
i
do
so
again
straightway
slay
me
his
disciples
accordingly
sharpened
their
knives
once
more
bayázíd
cried
out
within
my
vesture
is
naught
but
god
whether
you
seek
him
on
earth
or
heaven
the
disciples
at
his
remarks
straightway
plunged
their
knives
into
bayázíd
body
but
their
blades
were
turned
back
against
their
own
throats
so
that
they
died
he
explained
to
the
few
disciples
who
had
not
struck
him
that
the
ecstasy
he
had
been
experiencing
annihilated
self
his
form
is
vanished
he
is
a
mere
mirror
the
disciples
who
had
struck
him
saw
their
own
faces
in
that
mirror
and
so
wounded
themselves
and
not
bayázíd
whose
soul
had
left
the
mirror
of
his
body
and
was
one
with
the
beloved
perhaps
the
life
of
mansur
is
even
more
interesting
whether
he
was
a
mere
adventurer
or
genuine
exponent
of
súfíism
is
still
open
to
controversy
among
modern
súfís
it
will
be
perfectly
safe
to
describe
him
as
either
a
saint
or
a
vagabond
he
was
possibly
both
extremes
to
suit
the
necessities
of
a
very
exciting
and
eventful
career
he
was
born
in
the
close
of
the
ninth
century
and
was
said
to
perform
many
miracles
such
as
raising
the
dead
to
life
and
drawing
gold
and
flowers
from
the
air
according
to
his
own
belief
he
could
write
verses
equal
to
those
of
the
koran
he
went
one
better
than
the
superman
theory
however
and
called
himself
god
and
his
disciples
after
the
various
prophets
akbar
was
called
god
but
deification
in
this
case
did
not
sound
from
his
own
trumpet
it
sounded
from
the
trumpet
of
an
enthusiastic
poet
see
akbar
and
you
see
god
visited
india
for
the
purpose
of
studying
magic
and
there
saw
the
celebrated
rope
trick
on
that
occasion
performed
by
a
woman
a
point
of
considerable
interest
this
wrote
books
and
certainly
gained
considerable
influence
over
the
lower
classes
by
his
many
signs
and
wonders
he
is
said
to
have
disputed
the
necessity
of
making
a
pilgrimage
to
mecca
by
stating
that
by
occult
practices
it
could
be
performed
equally
well
in
any
room
on
a
certain
occasion
however
we
can
not
help
but
admire
wit
and
aptitude
one
day
he
stretched
forth
an
empty
hand
and
produced
from
the
air
an
apple
which
he
asserted
he
had
plucked
from
paradise
one
of
his
witnesses
disputed
his
assertion
because
this
particular
apple
was
and
therefore
not
of
divine
origin
at
once
replied
it
is
because
it
bath
come
forth
from
the
mansion
of
eternity
to
the
abode
of
decay
therefore
to
its
heart
hath
corruption
found
its
way
on
account
of
his
various
heretical
teachings
was
imprisoned
and
subjected
to
all
manner
of
cruelties
bravely
he
went
forth
to
the
place
of
crucifixion
for
four
days
he
was
nailed
on
a
cross
on
both
sides
of
the
tigris
from
these
tortures
he
was
finally
released
ten
years
later
he
was
executed
telling
his
disciples
he
would
return
to
them
in
thirty
days
and
exultantly
reciting
poetry
he
cried
from
his
own
cup
he
bade
me
sup
for
such
is
hospitality
a
comment
of
his
on
súfíism
a
very
ironical
one
was
that
which
is
mine
for
by
god
i
never
distinguished
for
a
moment
between
pleasure
and
pain
yet
another
characteristic
saying
of
his
was
the
way
to
god
is
two
steps
one
step
out
of
this
world
and
one
step
out
of
the
next
world
and
lo
you
are
there
with
the
lord
whatever
were
the
faults
of
and
they
were
many
at
least
it
may
be
said
of
him
that
he
was
a
brave
man
with
all
his
fanaticism
his
absurd
indiscretion
and
love
of
conjuring
he
left
much
behind
of
permanent
value
to
the
súfís
the
government
in
those
days
did
all
in
its
power
to
restrain
the
publicity
of
his
books
but
a
light
that
was
never
for
a
moment
set
under
a
bushel
can
not
be
hid
the
very
attempt
to
obliterate
it
is
in
itself
the
cause
for
a
keener
and
more
persistent
search
in
the
fifth
century
of
the
hijira
we
may
note
as
the
first
to
give
súfíism
politic
significance
and
imān
ghazālī
as
the
first
to
give
it
a
metaphysical
basis
at
this
time
we
find
in
súfí
books
many
terms
borrowed
from
the
books
on
ethics
as
well
as
poetry
now
became
impregnated
with
súfí
ideas
iii
the
nature
of
súfíism
the
súfís
are
folk
who
have
preferred
god
to
everything
so
that
god
has
preferred
them
to
in
the
islám
faith
there
are
eight
paradises
arranged
one
within
the
other
in
ascending
stages
the
highest
is
called
the
garden
of
eden
all
are
lovely
gardens
full
of
luxuriant
flowers
and
trees
amid
which
gleam
the
domes
and
minarets
of
gorgeous
palaces
rich
with
precious
stones
where
the
departed
are
feasted
and
entertained
by
beautiful
all
the
paradises
are
watered
by
rivers
such
as
the
kevser
the
tesním
and
the
selsebíl
the
great
tūba
tree
grows
in
the
highest
paradise
its
branches
fall
into
the
seven
other
gardens
this
brief
description
will
be
sufficient
to
show
the
nature
of
the
muslim
heaven
that
it
was
a
glorified
creation
of
the
earth
in
eight
degrees
is
evident
it
was
sensuous
rather
than
metaphysical
the
five
worlds
of
the
súfís
are
the
plane
of
the
absolute
invisible
the
relatively
invisible
the
world
of
similitudes
the
visible
world
or
the
plane
of
form
generation
and
corruption
the
world
of
man
these
five
planes
are
often
regarded
as
three
the
invisible
the
intermediate
and
the
visible
or
yet
again
as
simply
the
visible
and
invisible
above
the
plane
of
the
absolute
invisible
is
an
infinity
which
we
might
perhaps
compare
with
dante
spaceless
empyrean
the
súfís
regarded
the
existence
of
the
soul
as
moreover
that
the
full
perception
of
earthly
beauty
was
the
remembrance
of
that
supreme
beauty
in
the
spiritual
world
the
body
was
the
veil
but
by
ecstasy
the
soul
could
behold
the
divine
mysteries
as
avicenna
in
his
poem
on
the
soul
has
written
lo
it
was
hurled
midst
the
and
ruined
abodes
of
this
desolate
world
it
weeps
when
it
thinks
of
its
home
and
the
peace
it
possessed
with
tears
welling
forth
from
its
eyes
without
pausing
or
rest
and
with
plaintive
mourning
it
broodeth
like
one
bereft
such
trace
of
its
home
as
the
fourfold
winds
have
left
creation
was
regarded
as
the
output
of
the
the
visible
world
and
all
therein
was
a
reflection
of
the
divine
an
scene
full
of
the
spirit
of
god
the
following
beautiful
poem
of
jámí
from
will
illustrate
the
súfí
conception
of
the
beloved
and
his
significance
and
relationship
to
his
world
of
lovers
no
mirror
to
reflect
its
loveliness
nor
comb
to
touch
its
locks
the
morning
breeze
stirred
its
tresses
no
collyrium
lent
lustre
to
its
eyes
no
rosy
cheeks
by
dark
curls
like
hyacinth
nor
down
were
there
to
itself
it
sang
of
love
in
wordless
measure
by
itself
it
cast
the
die
of
love
one
gleam
fell
from
it
on
the
universe
and
on
the
angels
and
this
single
ray
dazzled
the
angels
till
their
senses
whirled
like
the
revolving
sky
in
diverse
forms
each
mirror
showed
it
forth
and
everywhere
its
praise
was
chanted
in
new
harmonies
the
spirits
who
explore
the
depths
of
boundless
seas
wherein
the
heavens
swim
like
some
small
boat
cried
with
one
mighty
voice
praise
to
the
lord
of
all
the
universe
his
beauty
everywhere
doth
show
itself
and
through
the
forms
of
earthly
beauties
shines
obscured
as
through
a
veil
thou
seest
a
veil
beneath
that
veil
he
hides
whatever
heart
doth
yield
to
love
he
charms
it
in
his
love
the
heart
hath
life
longing
for
him
the
soul
hath
victory
man
was
therefore
a
part
of
god
because
he
was
a
fragment
of
the
whole
or
better
still
he
was
a
divine
emanation
the
súfí
recognised
this
fact
and
his
supreme
desire
was
to
be
reunited
with
the
beloved
his
difficulty
however
was
to
bear
in
mind
that
his
worship
should
ever
be
of
god
and
not
of
god
many
beautiful
forms
love
came
into
his
heart
and
he
endeavoured
to
recognise
that
earthly
objects
however
dear
and
beautiful
they
might
be
were
but
lanterns
where
god
light
shone
through
here
it
must
be
readily
admitted
that
súfíism
often
fails
the
súfí
poets
were
much
given
to
excessive
laudations
of
physical
beauty
and
we
often
find
with
all
the
toleration
and
ingenuity
we
can
bring
to
bear
that
some
of
lines
are
no
more
spiritual
than
anacreon
to
whom
he
has
been
compared
we
have
a
number
of
súfí
words
with
a
strictly
súfí
meaning
but
it
would
not
be
wise
to
strain
the
analogy
of
earthly
love
too
far
and
say
that
everything
that
háfiz
wrote
was
spiritual
the
súfí
poets
for
the
most
part
wrote
about
the
love
of
god
in
the
terms
applied
to
their
beautiful
women
for
the
simple
reason
that
no
one
can
write
the
celestial
language
and
be
understood
at
the
same
time
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
súfís
still
remembering
their
old
their
old
earthly
delights
in
women
dear
to
them
should
find
it
difficult
to
apply
such
names
such
ideas
even
in
their
love
of
the
one
beloved
take
those
expressions
literally
and
many
of
them
are
sensuous
but
consider
them
as
brave
strong
strivings
fraught
with
much
spiritual
fervour
after
god
and
you
at
once
annihilate
prejudice
and
come
very
near
understanding
the
meaning
of
súfíism
we
need
not
fly
to
grundy
and
seek
shelter
under
her
hypocritical
wing
when
some
really
devout
and
sincere
súfí
calls
god
the
eternal
darling
or
sings
about
the
beloved
curls
in
studying
súfíism
from
súfí
poetry
we
must
always
remember
that
eastern
poetry
is
essentially
erotic
in
expression
but
just
as
essentially
symbolic
in
we
must
also
bear
in
mind
and
this
point
must
have
had
its
influence
upon
súfíism
that
the
muslim
reward
for
having
lived
a
good
life
according
to
the
teaching
of
mohammed
was
that
he
should
enjoy
an
eternal
with
lovely
it
may
be
questioned
that
if
the
earthly
object
of
love
was
a
mere
passing
shadow
of
god
the
man
who
loved
that
object
was
equally
insignificant
and
again
how
can
god
be
the
when
according
to
the
súfí
thesis
he
divided
himself
into
creation
the
part
is
not
equal
to
the
whole
these
questions
are
easily
answered
the
stars
shine
in
the
sky
and
on
the
bosom
of
the
sea
without
diminution
let
the
sea
pass
away
and
the
pass
away
too
but
the
stars
are
still
there
so
when
the
world
shall
pass
away
it
will
only
be
the
fading
of
innumerable
shadows
we
call
humanity
god
will
still
be
there
and
we
shall
still
be
there
because
we
came
alone
from
him
there
was
a
voice
that
sounded
in
men
and
women
in
mountains
and
in
seas
in
the
beasts
of
the
jungle
and
the
swinging
of
the
stars
it
was
the
voice
of
love
the
great
beckoning
in
the
hereafter
to
which
all
things
must
go
that
voice
to
the
súfí
was
god
calling
his
lovers
into
one
chamber
one
mighty
jámí
has
expressed
the
finality
of
love
in
the
following
lines
gaze
till
gazing
out
of
gazing
grew
to
being
her
i
gaze
on
she
and
i
no
more
but
in
one
undivided
being
blended
all
that
is
not
one
must
ever
suffer
with
the
wound
of
absence
and
whoever
in
love
city
enters
finds
but
room
for
one
and
but
in
oneness
union
the
rev
professor
inge
in
has
brought
a
good
deal
of
adverse
criticism
to
bear
upon
súfíism
he
remarks
the
súfís
or
mohammedan
mystics
use
erotic
language
very
freely
and
appear
like
true
asiatics
to
have
attempted
to
give
a
sacramental
or
symbolic
character
to
the
indulgence
of
their
passions
the
same
writer
accuses
emerson
of
playing
with
pantheistic
mysticism
of
the
oriental
type
and
goes
on
to
compare
him
with
the
persian
súfís
on
account
of
his
this
critic
in
his
desire
to
defame
the
súfís
states
that
they
are
among
the
most
shocking
and
blasphemous
of
the
mystics
because
they
believe
that
state
is
present
with
them
even
in
their
earthly
life
this
however
is
no
teaching
of
the
súfís
and
rightly
considered
we
can
not
even
except
the
sayings
of
bayázíd
already
referred
to
because
here
he
undoubtedly
denies
all
claim
to
human
personality
admitting
god
only
is
no
teaching
of
the
súfís
as
the
buddhist
belief
in
nirvana
was
a
state
only
to
be
reached
by
degrees
after
much
striving
and
severe
discipline
so
was
the
fusion
of
the
beloved
and
his
lover
a
belief
and
a
beautiful
hope
far
out
on
the
spiritual
horizon
hadj
khan
in
his
interesting
book
the
pilgrims
to
briefly
touches
upon
this
sect
and
mentions
seven
stages
in
the
spiritual
growth
of
the
súfí
and
not
an
arrogant
proclamation
of
deity
and
man
being
coequal
in
the
earthly
existence
the
gradually
ascending
scale
of
the
súfí
heaven
is
another
point
in
favour
of
this
argument
for
the
love
that
thou
find
demands
the
sacrifice
of
self
to
the
end
that
the
heart
may
be
filled
with
the
passion
to
stand
within
the
holy
of
holies
in
which
alone
the
mysteries
of
the
true
beloved
can
be
revealed
unto
thee
the
average
súfí
was
a
poet
all
that
was
beautiful
was
god
to
him
he
tried
to
be
nearer
the
beautiful
every
day
and
thus
his
soul
swept
on
from
flower
to
flower
higher
and
higher
until
he
was
absorbed
into
the
divine
we
have
now
seen
that
súfíism
is
essentially
a
religion
of
love
without
a
creed
or
dogma
no
merciless
hells
leap
up
in
the
súfí
beliefs
he
has
no
theory
for
the
life
beyond
the
ways
of
god
are
as
the
number
of
the
souls
of
men
there
is
splendid
magnificent
in
this
súfí
remark
this
unsectarian
teaching
should
be
applied
to
every
religion
it
would
tend
to
sweeten
and
deepen
the
thoughts
of
men
who
would
forget
the
petty
of
creeds
and
dogmas
lost
in
the
perception
of
the
iv
the
influence
of
súfíism
this
love
here
forms
the
centre
which
expands
on
all
sides
and
into
all
hegel
although
rúmí
lived
for
fifty
years
in
a
turkish
city
he
scarcely
ever
used
any
turkish
words
but
nevertheless
his
influence
on
turkish
poetry
was
very
considerable
the
turkish
poets
of
that
day
poured
forth
innumerable
spiritual
couplets
of
a
mystical
nature
indeed
nearly
all
the
ottoman
poets
were
either
súfís
or
men
who
wrote
after
the
manner
of
the
persian
súfís
jalál
son
sultan
valad
wrote
in
turkish
the
following
concerning
his
father
wot
ye
well
mevláná
is
of
saints
the
pole
whatsoever
thing
he
sayeth
do
in
whole
all
his
words
are
mercies
from
the
heavenly
king
such
that
blind
folks
eyes
were
opened
did
they
sing
the
súfí
influence
on
turkish
poetry
many
years
after
jalál
death
gradually
weakened
as
time
went
on
and
their
poetry
became
less
mystical
the
french
were
probably
responsible
for
this
change
to
a
certain
extent
then
again
súfíism
influenced
the
poetry
of
india
but
in
this
case
there
was
influence
on
both
sides
and
the
súfís
probably
borrowed
some
of
the
buddhistic
ideas
especially
in
regard
to
their
later
conception
of
divine
absorption
the
following
remark
of
abú
bahu
certainly
points
to
the
belief
that
the
súfís
inculcated
certain
ideas
from
the
vedanta
philosophy
is
control
of
the
faculties
and
of
the
súfí
poetry
has
greatly
influenced
western
thought
many
of
the
german
mystics
wrote
as
the
súfí
poets
had
written
before
them
particularly
might
be
mentioned
eckhart
tauler
and
suso
concerning
the
last
mentioned
i
may
quote
the
following
passage
to
demonstrate
my
meaning
earthly
friends
must
needs
endure
to
be
distinct
and
separate
from
those
whom
they
love
but
thou
o
fathomless
sweetness
of
all
true
love
meltest
into
the
heart
of
thy
beloved
and
pourest
thyself
fully
into
the
essence
of
his
soul
that
nothing
of
thee
remains
outside
but
thou
art
joined
and
united
most
lovingly
with
thy
beloved
there
was
rapturous
language
both
with
the
persian
and
german
mystics
the
great
difference
between
them
was
that
the
german
mystics
for
the
most
part
were
ascetics
the
persians
were
not
then
again
in
the
nineteenth
century
hegel
was
loud
in
his
praise
of
rúmí
calling
him
a
great
thinker
as
well
as
a
great
poet
but
somehow
he
seems
to
put
jalál
pantheism
first
his
mysticism
second
surely
this
was
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse
to
trace
the
scope
of
the
influence
of
súfí
thought
in
england
would
be
extremely
interesting
but
the
limits
of
this
little
book
will
not
admit
of
our
doing
so
the
influence
was
at
first
among
the
few
but
optimistic
lovers
of
the
east
believe
that
oriental
thought
is
daily
becoming
of
more
interest
to
western
minds
the
student
knows
that
edward
fitzgerald
rendering
of
omar
khayyám
was
anything
but
a
faithful
translation
that
fitzgerald
shook
up
omar
words
like
so
many
dice
and
set
them
to
the
music
of
wine
roses
and
pessimism
the
omar
khayyám
club
read
fitzgerald
but
not
omar
khayyám
and
in
consequence
they
have
fallen
into
the
error
of
associating
omar
with
bacchus
but
nevertheless
we
must
be
grateful
to
fitzgerald
he
has
given
us
a
great
poem
and
stirred
let
us
hope
many
of
his
countless
readers
to
a
more
faithful
study
of
persian
poetry
the
indefatigable
johnson
has
written
the
following
on
the
persian
poet
who
is
the
subject
of
our
present
volume
he
makes
plain
to
the
pilgrim
the
secrets
of
the
way
of
unity
and
unveils
the
mysteries
of
the
path
of
eternal
truth
concerning
our
modern
poets
i
have
quoted
elsewhere
a
few
lines
of
arthur
symons
on
a
dancing
dervish
many
of
the
late
thomas
lake
harris
poems
are
of
a
súfí
nature
in
stephen
phillip
beautiful
poem
marpessa
the
following
lines
are
full
of
sidi
mysticism
for
they
seeking
that
perfect
face
beyond
the
world
approach
in
vision
earthly
semblances
and
touch
and
at
the
shadows
flee
away
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
at
least
one
celebrated
englishman
adopted
the
súfí
teaching
i
refer
to
sir
richard
burton
the
súfís
believed
heart
and
soul
in
the
beautiful
lines
of
cameons
the
poet
for
whom
burton
had
so
great
an
affection
do
what
thy
manhood
bids
thee
do
from
none
but
self
expect
applause
he
noblest
lives
and
noblest
dies
who
makes
and
keeps
his
laws
all
other
life
is
living
death
a
world
where
none
but
phantoms
dwell
a
breath
a
wind
a
sound
a
voice
a
tinkling
of
the
analysis
of
the
religion
of
love
put
away
the
tale
of
love
that
travellers
tell
do
thou
serve
god
with
all
thy
might
rúmí
súfíism
then
is
the
religion
of
love
lafcadio
hearn
tells
us
in
his
inimitable
way
that
earthly
love
is
brought
about
by
the
memories
of
innumerable
loves
in
the
past
a
host
of
the
phantoms
of
you
seeking
in
your
momentary
ego
the
joy
of
love
over
again
schopenhauer
with
much
pride
quotes
rochefoucauld
as
having
said
that
love
may
be
compared
to
a
ghost
since
it
is
something
we
talk
about
but
have
never
seen
precisely
but
this
is
no
antagonistic
statement
as
schopenhauer
supposed
rather
than
belittling
the
beauty
of
love
it
is
an
unconscious
defence
of
a
very
great
truth
love
can
only
be
compared
with
love
there
is
nothing
else
to
compare
it
with
no
one
has
seen
love
because
no
one
has
seen
god
a
little
child
plays
at
funerals
and
tenderly
buries
a
dead
butterfly
not
because
it
understands
the
mystery
of
death
but
because
love
prompted
the
action
and
so
we
love
without
knowing
the
why
and
the
wherefore
scientists
have
already
proved
that
first
love
is
not
controlled
by
either
of
the
individuals
loving
that
it
is
but
the
expression
of
thousands
of
tendencies
in
past
lives
that
love
can
be
ever
personal
ever
limited
to
the
individual
is
unthinkable
we
must
recognise
some
day
that
those
countless
tendencies
those
strivings
after
men
and
women
seeming
to
hold
our
souls
affinities
were
but
the
momentary
finding
of
god
in
his
creatures
we
do
not
love
a
woman
merely
because
she
is
pretty
possesses
a
pleasing
mannerism
we
love
her
because
in
an
indescribable
way
she
sings
a
song
we
alone
can
fully
understand
a
voice
that
lifts
up
our
soul
and
makes
it
strong
we
follow
that
invisible
figure
from
land
to
land
from
heart
to
heart
from
death
into
life
on
and
on
when
love
loves
love
for
its
own
sake
when
the
self
is
dead
we
shall
meet
him
we
shall
find
the
beloved
to
be
the
perfection
the
realisation
of
that
strong
desire
that
made
us
lose
ourselves
in
others
the
more
we
lose
ourselves
in
god
the
more
we
find
him
men
and
women
love
and
die
but
love
is
a
divine
essence
working
through
and
through
innumerable
lives
for
its
own
eternal
glory
personality
is
limited
only
to
the
finite
world
perhaps
a
phase
or
two
beyond
the
grave
even
that
is
the
of
countless
personalities
in
the
past
we
love
instinctively
if
it
was
wholly
physical
then
it
dies
with
the
death
of
the
object
if
it
was
infinitely
more
than
that
if
it
was
the
love
of
goodness
and
purity
and
the
beautiful
it
lives
on
for
ever
but
these
things
live
not
eternally
in
humanity
they
are
parts
of
that
essence
the
love
divine
love
god
light
in
men
and
women
and
not
the
lanterns
through
which
it
shines
for
human
bodies
must
turn
to
dust
human
memories
human
desires
fade
away
but
the
love
of
the
remains
and
when
such
is
found
in
earthly
love
it
is
god
finding
himself
in
you
and
you
in
him
that
is
the
supreme
teaching
of
súfíism
the
religion
of
love

part
of
the
king
whatever
the
cause
however
left
balkh
together
with
his
family
and
settled
at
nishapur
it
was
here
that
the
celebrated
súfí
presented
young
rúmí
with
his
and
informed
his
father
that
the
child
would
some
day
become
famous
throughout
the
world
after
the
destruction
of
balkh
the
family
went
to
qonia
an
old
roman
province
where
the
poet
acquired
his
name
rúmí
or
the
roman
young
jalál
must
have
been
a
child
prodigy
if
we
are
to
believe
the
many
wonderful
stories
of
his
early
days
at
six
years
of
age
he
is
said
to
have
seen
visions
taught
his
playmates
philosophy
and
performed
many
marvellous
feats
such
as
flying
into
the
celestial
regions
on
the
death
of
his
father
jalál
took
the
professorial
chair
he
also
founded
an
order
of
dervishes
known
as
maulavis
where
he
authorised
music
and
religious
dance
when
asked
why
he
introduced
singing
and
dance
at
a
funeral
such
practice
being
contrary
to
custom
jalál
replied
when
the
human
spirit
after
years
of
imprisonment
in
the
cage
and
dungeon
of
the
body
is
at
length
set
free
and
wings
its
flight
to
the
source
whence
it
came
is
not
this
an
occasion
for
rejoicings
thanks
and
dancing
jalál
was
an
indomitable
optimist
in
his
sayings
and
still
more
in
his
poetry
we
find
an
almost
untrammelled
ecstasy
the
religious
dances
known
as
rizā
kulī
may
in
some
way
account
for
jalál
occasional
lack
of
care
displayed
in
his
poetry
and
also
for
the
outbursts
not
far
removed
from
insanity
we
are
informed
by
daulat
sháh
that
there
was
a
pillar
in
the
maulavi
house
and
when
he
was
drowned
in
the
ocean
of
love
he
used
to
take
hold
of
that
pillar
and
set
himself
turning
round
it
it
was
while
turning
round
the
pillar
that
he
not
infrequently
dictated
much
of
his
poetry
as
arthur
symons
has
sung
i
turn
until
my
sense
dizzied
with
waves
of
air
spins
to
a
point
intense
and
spires
and
centres
there
we
can
well
imagine
jalál
writing
the
following
under
the
conditions
just
mentioned
come
come
thou
art
the
soul
the
soul
so
dear
revolving
come
come
thou
art
the
cedar
the
cedar
spear
revolving
oh
come
the
well
of
light
springs
and
morning
stars
exult
in
gladness
sheer
revolving
in
jalál
was
married
at
lerenda
to
gevher
pearl

bore
two
sons
and
died
early
in
life
jalál
married
again
and
his
second
wife
survived
him
ii
shamsi
tabriz
a
word
must
now
be
said
about
shamsi
tabrīz
an
intimate
friend
of
jalál
we
have
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
that
shamsi
tabrīz
jalál
de
was
an
actual
person
and
not
a
mythical
creation
on
the
part
of
the
poet
this
mysterious
being
who
flitted
across
jalál
life
so
tragically
seems
to
have
had
great
personal
influence
over
the
poet
who
went
with
him
into
solitary
places
and
there
discussed
profound
mysteries
the
scholars
of
jalál
looked
upon
the
whole
affair
as
an
unworthy
infatuation
on
the
part
of
their
master
and
on
the
part
of
shams
a
shameful
seduction
their
protests
brought
about
the
flight
of
shams
who
fled
to
tabrīz
but
it
was
only
a
momentary
separation
jalál
followed
this
strange
figure
and
brought
him
back
again
most
of
his
lighter
poetry
was
composed
during
this
separation
another
disturbance
however
caused
the
departure
of
shams
to
damascus
we
then
have
no
clear
record
of
him
various
legends
exist
in
regard
to
the
death
of
this
mysterious
person
it
may
be
safely
stated
however
that
shams
met
with
a
violent
death
the
exact
nature
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
say
definitely
this
strange
union
is
by
no
means
unique
in
the
history
of
the
world
literature
the
union
however
in
this
particular
case
is
extremely
difficult
to
rightly
fathom
we
may
reasonably
infer
that
jalál
intense
poetic
temperament
became
fascinated
by
the
dogmatic
and
powerful
shams
the
very
treatment
of
this
friendship
both
in
the
lyrical
poems
and
in
the
is
súfí
the
two
following
quotations
from
many
that
might
be
cited
will
prove
sufficient
to
illustrate
this
point
the
face
of
shamsi
dín
tabrīz
glory
is
the
sun
in
whose
track
the
hearts
are
moving
o
shamsi
tabrīz
beauty
and
glory

the
horizons
what
king
but
is
a
beggar
of
thee

heart
and

iii
the
stories
of
and
the
death
of
rúmí
the
historian
in
his
collection
of
anecdotes
called
menaqibu
gives
a
number
of
stories
relating
to
the
miracles
and
wise
sayings
of
jalál
many
of
these
miraculous
performances
were
followed
by
the
conversion
of
those
who
witnessed
them
a
marvel
or
a
wise
saying
of
jalál
was
generally
accompanied
by
music
and
dance
which
reminds
us
of
the
jubilations
of
the
indian
gods
after
victories
over
his
enemies
these
stories
interesting
enough
in
themselves
can
scarcely
be
credited
to
such
a
learned
man
as
jalál
undoubtedly
was
according
to
tradition
he
spoke
to
frogs
and
fishes
raised
the
dead
to
life
and
at
the
same
time
very
ignominiously
lost
his
temper
when
a
disciple
who
said
after
having
received
instructions
god
willing
after
all
the
significance
of
jalál
lies
not
in
these
rather
lamentable
fairy
tales
but
in
the
fruit
of
his
work
jalál
like
the
lord
buddha
suffered
considerably
from
the
addition
of
fabulous
tales
and
fancies
of
no
real
moment
to
his
teachings
tells
a
pretty
story
concerning
the
tenderness
of
jalál
for
little
children
as
the
poet
passed
by
some
children
they
left
their
play
and
ran
to
him
and
bowed
jalál
bowed
in
response
one
little
boy
some
distance
off
seeing
the
honour
bestowed
upon
his
playmates
cried
to
jalál
wait
for
me
until
i
come
and
jalál
waited
and
bowed
to
the
little
child
this
story
is
worth
far
more
than
juggler
tricks
rúmí
died
at
qonia
in
praising
god
and
leaving
to
the
world
a
vast
store
of
spiritual
knowledge
and
many
wise
instructions
to
his
son
valad
it
is
very
gratifying
to
note
that
at
the
death
of
jalál
his
mourners
were
of
all
creeds
a
christian
was
asked
why
he
wept
over
a
muslim
grave
and
he
replied
we
esteem
him
as
the
moses
the
david
the
jesus
of
our
time
and
we
are
his
disciples
his
adherents
this
was
indeed
a
splendid
and
worthy
tribute
to
the
memory
of
so
great
a
man
i
hope
i
have
already
demonstrated
that
the
very
nature
of
súfí
poetry
is
entirely
lacking
in
creed
or
dogma
and
certainly
the
great
singer
of
the
has
left
in
his
songs
a
wealth
of
the
wonder
of
divine
love
iv
the
nature
and
significance
of
rúmí
poetry
we
have
already
noted
the
acceptance
of
the
among
the
other
literary
influences
according
to
nicholson
we
may
note
the
poems
of
and
nīzamī
the
fact
that
jalál
poetry
sometimes
faintly
resembles
omar
is
too
slight
to
be
of
any
value
nicholson
very
ably
sums
up
the
nature
of
the
and
respectively
the
one
is
a
majestic
river
calm
and
deep
meandering
through
many
a
rich
and
varied
landscape
to
the
immeasurable
ocean
the
other
a
foaming
torrent
that
leaps
and
plunges
in
the
ethereal
solitude
of
the
hills
the
poetry
of
jalál
is
not
of
equal
merit
his
work
seldom
if
ever
has
the
technical
polish
of
jámí
there
is
too
much
of
it
too
much
produced
in
the
belief
that
all
his
poetry
was
inspired
he
is
fond
of
harping
on
certain
words
and
as
far
as
the
translations
are
concerned
he
has
little
sense
of
humour
there
was
certainly
room
for
a
touch
of
humour
in
the
poet
description
of
iblis
receiving
from
god
a
gift
of
beautiful
women
whereby
to
tempt
mankind
but
jalál
entirely
ignores
it
these
weaknesses
are
almost
lost
in
the
strength
and
purity
and
lyrical
grandeur
of
many
of
jalál
poems
he
carries
us
along
on
a
torrent
of
heavenly
music
the
rhythmic
swing
of
his
wonderful
dance
is
we
seem
to
move
exultantly
ecstatically
to
the
sound
of
the
poet
singing
far
behind
the
silver
stars
into
the
presence
of
the
beloved
with
what
reverence
with
what
a
glow
of
simile
and
subtle
suggestion
he
describes
the
beauty
of
the
beloved
with
what
exquisite
passion
he
foretells
the
eternal
union
then
there
is
a
lull
in
this
fierce
spiritual
song
and
jalál
sings
ever
so
gently
and
with
an
infinite
tenderness
about
human
tears
being
turned
into
he
sings
about
the
meeting
of
two
friends
in
paradise
with
the
refrain
thou
and
i
there
seems
in
this
poem
an
indescribable
and
almost
pathetic
play
on
the
idea
of
human
friendship
and
the
divine
friendship
a
yearning
tenderness
for
that
human
shadow
passing
shadow
though
it
be
jalál
appears
to
have
the
power
of
producing
almost
orchestral
effects
in
his
music
of
the
spheres
there
is
that
terrific
touch
of
wagner
about
his
poetry
and
in
those
suggestive
there
is
a
tenderness
of
expression
more
touching
more
truly
great
than
the
loud
triumphant
notes
jalál
has
truly
said
our
journey
is
to
the
of
union
he
sang
about
the
divine
but
he
did
not
forget
to
sing
about
the
roses
that
fade
and
the
human
hearts
that
ache
we
seem
to
see
jalál
ever
bowing
to
the
little
child
in
all
his
wonderful
singing
jalál
is
said
to
have
been
years
engaged
in
writing
the
often
whole
nights
were
spent
in
its
composition
jalál
reciting
and
his
friend
hasam
copying
it
down
and
sometimes
singing
portions
of
the
verse

his
beautiful
voice

profound
mysteries

a
most
important
book
in
the
study
of
súfíism
mysteries
which
must
for
the
most
part
be
left
to
the
discernment
of
the
reader
jalál
himself
has
said
that
great
love
is
silent
it
is
in
silence
that
we
shall
come
to
understand
the
supreme
mystery
of
love
that
has
no
comparison
the
to
the
may
be
found
in
the
prologue
to
the
first
book
the
poet
here
sings
of
the
soul
longing
to
be
united
with
the
beloved
the
fact
that
he
and
all
other
súfí
poets
use
as
an
analogy
the
love
between
man
and
woman
renders
the
spiritual
meaning
extremely
vague
we
have
however
already
considered
this
point
in
the
introduction
and
it
needs
no
further
explanation
the
has
all
the
pantheistic
beauty
of
the
psalms
the
music
of
the
hills
the
colour
and
scent
of
roses
the
swaying
of
forests
but
it
has
considerably
more
than
that
these
things
of
scent
and
form
and
colour
are
the
mirror
of
the
beloved
these
earthy
loves
the

is

wears
not
true
love

but
shame
without
the

love
and
the
lover
that
live
to
all

not
thy
heart
on
aught

is
only
borrowed
how
long
wilt
thou
embrace
a
dead

which
is
embraced
by
nothing
what
was
born
of

in
autumn

no
aiding
from
the
early
spring
the
house
of
love
this
is
the
lord
of
heaven
who
resembles
venus
and
the
moon
this
is
the
house
of
love
which
has
no
bound
or
end
like
a
mirror
the
soul
has
received
thy
image
in
its
heart
the
tip
of
thy
curl
has
sunk
into
my
heart
like
a
comb
forasmuch
as
the
women
cut
their
hands
in
joseph
presence
come
to
me
o
soul
for
the
beloved

and
the

forth
thy
face
from
the
veil
of

for
i
desire
that
radiant
glowing
countenance
the
finding
of
the
beloved
i
was
on
that
day
when
the
names
were
not
nor
any
sign
of
existence
endowed
with
name
by
me
names
and
named
were
brought
to
view
on
the
day
when
there
was
not
i
and
we
for
a
sign
the
tip
of
the
beloved
curl
became
a
centre
of
revelation
as
yet
the
tip
of
that
curl
was
not
cross
and
christians
from
end
to
end
i
surveyed
he
was
not
on
the
cross
i
went
to
the
to
the
ancient
pagoda
no
trace
was
visible
there
i
went
to
the
mountains
of
herāt
and
candahār
i
looked
he
was
not
in
that
i
gazed
into
my
own
heart
there
i
saw
him
he
was
nowhere
else
god
only
none
but
god
has
contemplated
the
beauty
of
god
this
eye
and
that
lamp
are
two
lights
each
individual
when
they
came
together
no
one
distinguished
them
the
and
the
sea
at
a
moon
appeared
in
the
sky
and
descended
from
the
sky
and
gazed
on
me
like
a
falcon
which
snatches
a
bird
at
the
time
of
hunting
that
moon
snatched
me
up
and
coursed
over
the
sky
when
i
looked
at
myself
i
saw
myself
no
more
because
in
that
moon
my
body
became
by
grace
even
as
soul
when
i
travelled
in
soul
i
saw
naught
save
the
moon
till
the
secret
of
the
eternal
theophany
was
revealed
the
nine
spheres
of
heaven
were
all
merged
in
that
moon
the
vessel
of
my
being
was
completely
hidden
in
the
sea
the
sea
broke
into
waves
and
again
wisdom
rose
and
cast
abroad
a
voice
so
it
happened
and
thus
it
befell
foamed
the
sea
and
at
every
something
took
figure
and
something
was
bodied
forth
every
of
body
which
received
a
sign
from
that
sea
melted
straightway
and
turned
to
spirit
in
this
ocean
life
in
death
when
my
bier
moveth
on
the
day
of
death
think
not
my
heart
is
in
this
world
do
not
weep
in
the
devil
snare
that
is
woe
when
thou
seest
my
hearse
cry
not
parted
parted
union
and
meeting
are
mine
in
that
hour
if
thou
commit
me
to
the
grave
say
not
farewell
farewell
for
the
grave
is
a
curtain
hiding
the
communion
of
paradise
after
beholding
descent
consider
resurrection
why
should
setting
be
injurious
to
the
sun
and
moon
to
thee
it
seems
a
setting
but
is
a
rising
tho
the
vault
seems
a
prison
is
the
release
of
the
soul
shut
thy
mouth
on
this
side
and
open
it
beyond
for
in
placeless
air
will
be
thy
triumphal
song
the
whole
and
the
part
beware
do
not
keep
in
a
circle
of
reprobates
thine
eye
shut
like
a
bud
thy
mouth
open
like
the
rose
the
world
resembles
a
mirror
thy
love
is
the
perfect
image
o
people
who
has
ever
seen
a
part
greater
than
the
whole
the
divine
friend
look
on
me
for
thou
art
my
companion
in
the
grave
on
the
night
when
thou
shalt
pass
from
shop
and
dwelling
thou
shalt
hear
my
hail
in
the
hollow
of
the
tomb
it
shall
become
known
to
thee
that
thou
wast
never
concealed
from
mine
eye
i
am
as
reason
and
intellect
within
thy
bosom
at
the
time
of
joy
and
gladness
at
the
time
of
sorrow
and
distress
in
the
hour
when
the
intellectual
lamp
is
lighted
what
a
pears
goes
up
from
the
dead
men
in
the
tombs
aspiration
haste
haste
for
we
too
o
soul
are
coming
from
this
world
of
severance
to
that
world
of
union
o
how
long
shall
we
like
children
in
the
earthly
sphere
fill
our
lap
with
dust
and
stones
and
sherds
let
us
give
up
the
earth
and
fly
heavenwards
let
us
flee
from
childhood
to
the
banquet
of
men
behold
how
the
earthly
frame
has
entrapped
thee
rend
the
sack
and
raise
thy
head
clear
i
well
cherish
the
soul
i
am
a
painter
a
maker
of
pictures
every
moment
i
shape
a
beauteous
form
and
then
in
thy
presence
i
melt
them
all
away
i
call
up
a
hundred
phantoms
and
indue
them
with
a
spirit
when
i
behold
thy
phantom
i
cast
them
in
the
fire
lo
i
will
cherish
the
soul
because
it
has
a
perfume
of
thee
every
drop
of
blood
which
proceeds
from
me
is
saying
to
thy
dust
i
am
one
colour
with
thy
love
i
am
a
partner
of
thy
affection
in
the
house
of
water
and
clay
this
heart
is
desolate
without
thee
o
beloved
enter
the
house
or
i
will
leave
it
this
is
love
this
is
love
to
fly
heavenward
to
rend
every
instant
a
hundred
veils
the
first
moment
to
renounce
life
the
last
step
to
feel
without
feet
to
regard
this
world
as
invisible
not
to
see
what
appears
to
one
self
o
heart
i
said
may
it
bless
thee
to
have
entered
the
circle
of
lovers
to
look
beyond
the
range
of
the
eye
to
penetrate
the
windings
of
the
bosom
whence
did
this
breath
come
to
thee
o
my
soul
whence
this
throbbing
o
my
heart
the
journey
to
the
beloved
o
lovers
o
lovers
it
is
time
to
abandon
the
world
the
drum
of
departure
reaches
my
spiritual
ear
from
heaven
behold
the
driver
has
risen
and
made
ready
his
files
of
camels
and
begged
us
to
acquit
him
of
blame
why
o
travellers
are
you
asleep
these
sounds
before
and
behind
are
the
din
of
departure
and
of
the
with
each
moment
a
soul
and
spirit
is
setting
off
into
the
void
from
these
inverted
candles
from
these
blue
awnings
there
has
come
forth
a
wondrous
people
that
the
mysteries
may
be
revealed
a
heavy
slumber
fell
upon
thee
from
the
circling
spheres
alas
for
this
life
so
light
beware
of
this
slumber
so
heavy
o
soul
seek
the
beloved
o
friend
seek
the
friend
o
watchman
be
wakeful
it
behoves
not
a
watchman
to
sleep
the
day
of
resurrection
on
every
side
is
clamour
and
tumult
in
every
street
are
candles
and
torches
for
the
teeming
world
gives
birth
to
the
world
everlasting
thou
wert
dust
and
art
spirit
thou
wert
ignorant
and
art
wise
he
who
has
led
thee
thus
far
will
lead
thee
further
also
how
pleasant
are
the
pains
he
makes
thee
suffer
while
he
gently
draws
thee
to
himself
the
return
of
the
beloved
always
at
night
returns
the
beloved
do
not
eat
opium
close
your
mouth
against
food
that
you
may
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
mouth
lo
the
is
no
tyrant
and
in
his
assembly
there
is
a
circle
come
into
the
circle
be
seated
how
long
will
you
regard
the
revolution
of
time
why
when
god
earth
is
so
wide
have
you
fallen
asleep
in
a
prison
avoid
entangled
thoughts
that
you
may
see
the
explanation
of
paradise
refrain
from
speaking
that
you
may
win
speech
hereafter
abandon
life
and
the
world
that
you
may
behold
the
life
of
the
world
the
call
of
the
beloved
every
morning
a
voice
comes
to
thee
from
heaven
when
thou
the
dust
of
the
way
thou
thy
way
to
the
goal
on
the
road
to
the
of
union
lo
in
every
are
thousands
slain
of
desire
who
manfully
yielded
up
their
lives
thousands
sank
wounded
on
this
path
to
whom
there
came
not
a
breath
of
the
fragrance
of
union
a
token
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
friend
the
banquet
of
union
in
memory
of
the
banquet
of
union
in
yearning
for
his
beauty
they
are
fallen
bewildered
by
the
wine
thou
knowest
how
sweet
in
the
hope
of
him
on
the
threshold
of
his
abode
for
the
sake
of
seeing
his
face
to
bring
night
round
to
day
illumine
thy
bodily
senses
by
the
light
of
the
soul
look
not
in
the
world
for
bliss
and
fortune
since
thou
wilt
not
find
them
seek
bliss
in
both
worlds
by
serving
him
put
away
the
tale
of
love
that
travellers
tell
do
thou
serve
god
with
all
thy
might
be
silent
be
silent
that
the
lord
who
gave
thee
language
may
speak
for
as
he
fashioned
a
door
and
lock
he
has
also
made
a
key
thou
didst
go
to
the
at
last
thou
hast
departed
and
gone
to
the
unseen
is
marvellous
by
what
way
thou
wentest
from
the
world
thou
didst
strongly
shake
thy
wings
and
feathers
and
having
broken
thy
cage
didst
take
to
the
air
and
journey
towards
the
world
of
soul
thou
wert
a
favourite
falcon
kept
in
captivity
by
an
old
woman
when
thou
the
thou
didst
fly
away
into
the
void
thou
wert
a
nightingale
among
owls
the
scent
of
the
reached
thee
and
thou
didst
go
to
the
the
world
gave
thee
false
clues
the
world
gave
thee
false
clues
like
a
ghoul
thou
no
heed
of
the
clue
but
wentest
to
that
which
is
without
a
clue
since
thou
art
now
the
sun
why
dost
thou
wear
a
tiara
why
seek
a
girdle
since
thou
art
gone
from
the
middle
i
have
heard
that
thou
art
gazing
with
distorted
eyes
upon
thy
soul
why
dost
thou
gaze
on
thy
soul
since
thou
art
gone
to
the
soul
of
soul
o
heart
what
a
wondrous
bird
art
thou
that
in
chase
of
divine
rewards
thou
didst
fly
with
two
wings
to
the
like
a
shield
the
rose
flees
from
autumn
o
what
a
fearless
rose
art
thou
who
didst
go
loitering
along
in
the
presence
of
the
autumn
wind
falling
like
rain
from
heaven
upon
the
roof
of
the
terrestrial
world
thou
didst
run
in
every
direction
till
thou
didst
escape
by
conduit
be
silent
and
free
from
the
pain
of
speech
do
not
slumber
since
thou
hast
taken
refuge
with
so
loving
a
friend
he
comes
he
comes
a
moon
whose
like
the
sky
saw
awake
or
dreaming
crowned
with
eternal
flame
no
flood
can
lay
lo
from
the
flagon
of
thy
love
o
lord
my
soul
is
swimming
and
ruined
all
my
body
house
of
clay
when
first
the
giver
of
the
grape
my
lonely
heart
befriended
wine
fired
my
bosom
and
my
veins
filled
up
but
when
his
image
all
mine
eye
possessed
a
voice
descended
well
done
o
sovereign
wine
and
peerless
cup
love
mighty
arm
from
roof
to
base
each
dark
abode
is
hewing
where
chinks
reluctant
catch
a
golden
ray
my
heart
when

of
a
sudden
burst
into
its
viewing
leaped
headlong

cause
to
weep
if
thou
wilt
keep
thy
habitation
here
a
voice
at
morn
to
thee
is
borne

to
the
soul
if
on
the
way

soon
wilt
gain
the
goal

road

thine
toward
the
shrine
and
lo
in
bush
and
briar
the
many
slain
of
love
and
pain
in
flower
of
young
desire
who
on
the
track
fell
wounded
back
and
saw
not
ere
the
end
a
ray
of
bliss
a
touch
a
kiss
a
token
of
the
friend
thy
rose
our
sweetnesses
all
bleat
in
thee

infant
lips
their
smiles
benign

crushest
me
to
drops
of
rose
nor
the
press

repine
in
thy
sweet
pain

thy
rose

this
design

me
blossom
on
thy
robe
and
me
for
all
eyes
thy
sign
and
when
thou
me
on
the
world

blows
in
beauty
all
divine
i
saw
the
winter
weaving
i
saw
the
winter
weaving
from
flakes
a
robe
of
death
and
the
spring
found
earth
in
mourning
all
naked
lone
and
bare
i
heard
time
loom
that
wove
the
sun
dim
veil
i
saw
a
worm
in
its
own
lair
i
saw
the
great
was
smallest
and
saw
the
smallest
great
for
god
had
set
his
likeness
on
all
the
things
that
were
love
sounds
the
music
of
the
spheres
o
soul
if
thou
too
wouldst
be
free
then
love
the
love
that
shuts
thee
in
is
love
that
twisteth
every
snare
is
love
that
snaps
the
bond
of
sin

the
music
of
the

through
earth

the
flowers
of
spring
the
dawn
is
pale
from
yearning
love
the
moon
in
tears
is
sorrowing
thou
art
the
rose
and
deep
for
thee
in
sighs
the
nightingales

in
all

up
to
heaven
each
night
the
cry
of

with
might
the
cry
of
love

in
my
heart
at

happy
the
moment
when
we
are
seated
in
the
palace
thou

with
two
forms

two
figures

with
one
soul

my

my

thou
who

who
art
our

exalts

makes
the
very

to

with
joy
o
lover
was
love
that
gave
life
to
mount
sinai
when
it
quaked
and
moses
fell
down
in
a
swoon
did
my
beloved
only
touch
me
with
his
lips
i
too
like
a
flute
would
burst
out
into
melody
when
the
rose
has
faded
when
the
rose
has
faded
and
the
garden
is
withered
the
song
of
the
nightingale
is
no
longer
to
be
heard
the
beloved
is
all
in
all
the
lover
only
veils
him
the
beloved
is
all
that
lives
the
lover
a
dead
thing
when
the
lover
feels
no
longer
love
quickening
he
becomes
like
a
bird
who
has
lost
its
wings
alas
how
can
i
retain
my
senses
about
me
when
the
beloved
shows
not
the
light
of
his
countenance
the
silence
of
love
love
is
the
astrolabe
of
god
mysteries
a
lover
may
hanker
after
this
love
or
that
love
but
at
the
last
he
is
drawn
to
the
king
of
love
however
much
we
describe
and
explain
love
when
we
fall
in
love
we
are
ashamed
of
our
words
explanation
by
the
tongue
makes
most
things
clear
but
love
unexplained
is
better
earthly
love
essential
to
the
love
divine
in
one
was
said
leave
power
and
weakness
alone
whatever
withdraws
thine
eyes
from
god
is
an
idol
in
one
was
said
quench
not
thy
earthy
torch
that
it
may
be
a
light
to
lighten
mankind
if
thou
neglectest
regard
and
care
for
it
thou
wilt
quench
at
midnight
the
lamp
of
union
the
eternal
splendour
of
the
beloved
why
dost
thou
flee
from
the
cries
of
us
on
earth
why
pourest
thou
sorrow
on
the
heart
of
the
sorrowful
o
thou
who
as
each
new
morn
dawns
from
the
east
art
seen
uprising
anew
like
a
bright
fountain
what
excuse
makest
thou
for
thy
witcheries
o
thou
whose
lips
are
sweeter
than
sugar
thou
that
ever
renewest
the
life
of
this
old
world
hear
the
cry
of
this
lifeless
body

heart
woman
woman
is
a

not
a

as
it

became
beside
himself
at
that
sweet
call
his
prayer
failed
on
the
night
of
the
early
morning
halt
he
lifted
not
head
from
that
blissful
sleep
so
that
his
morning
prayer
was
put
off
till
noon
on
that
his
wedding
night
in
the
presence
of
his
bride
his
pure
soul
attained
to
kiss
her
hands
love
and
mistress
are
both
veiled
and
hidden
impute
it
not
a
fault
if
i
call

he
knows
about
it

desires
the
autumn
that
autumn
may
associate
itself
with

hide
the

and
the

shame
that

may
not

the

of
the

and
the
other
shame
that

and

may
appear
all
as

the

knows
the
difference
in
the
autumn
but
the
sight
of
is
better
than
the
world
sight
resignation
the
way
to
perfection
whoso
recognises
and
confesses
his
own
defects
is
hastening
in
the
way
that
leads
to
perfection
but
he
advances
not
towards
the
almighty
who
fancies
himself
to
be
perfect
love
the
source
of
light
rather
than
vanishing
form
whatsoever
is
perceived
by
sense
he
annuls
but
he
stablishes
that
which
is
hidden
from
the
senses
the
lover
love
is
visible
his
beloved
hidden
the
friend
is
absent
the
distraction
he
causes
present
renounce
these
affections
for
outward
forms
love
depends
not
on
outward
form
or
face
whatever
is
beloved
is
not
a
mere
empty
form
whether
your
beloved
be
of
the
earth
or
heaven
whatever
is
the
form
you
have
fallen
in
love
with
why
do
you
forsake
it
the
moment
life
leaves
it
the
form
is
still
there
whence
then
this
disgust
at
it
ah
lover
consider
well
what
is
really
your
beloved
if
a
thing
perceived
by
outward
senses
is
the
beloved
then
all
who
retain
their
senses
must
still
love
it
and
since
love
increases
constancy
how
can
constancy
fail
while
form
abides
but
the
truth
is
the
sun
beams
strike
the
wall
and
the
wall
only
reflects
that
borrowed
light
why
give
your
heart
to
mere
stones
o
simpleton
go
seek
the
source
of
light
which
shineth
alway
the
religion
of
love
the
sect
of
lovers
is
distinct
from
all
others
lovers
have
a
religion
and
a
faith
of
their
own
though
the
ruby
has
no
stamp
what
matters
it
love
is
fearless
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
of
fear
pain
is
a
treasure
pain
is
a
treasure
for
it
contains

the
kernel
is
soft
when
the
rind
is
scraped
off
o
brother
the
place
of
darkness
and
cold
is
the
fountain
of
life
and
the
cup
of
ecstasy
so
also

sickness
and

if
spiritual
manifestations
had
been
sufficient
the
creation
of
the

had
been
needless
and
vain
if
spiritual

were
equivalent
to
love
of

outward

of

prayers
would
not
exist
the
beloved
compared
to
a

garden
we
bow
down
our

before
his
edict
and
ordinance
we
stake
precious
life
to
gain
his
favour
while
the
thought
of
the

fills
our
hearts
all
our
work
is
to
do
him
service
and
spend
life
for
him
wherever
he
kindles
his
destructive
torch
myriads
of

who
dwell
within

are
moths
burnt

thither
for
god
will
shine
upon
you
and
seem
to
you
a
sweet
garden
instead
of
a
terror
he
will
infuse
into
your
soul
a
new
soul
so
as
to
fill
you
like
a
goblet
with
wine
take
up
your

in

take
up
your

in

o
bright
full

you
behold
the

of

the
sea
itself
is
one
thing
the

neglect
the

and
regard
the

with
your
eyes
waves
of
foam
rise
from
the

night
and
day
you
look
at
the
foam
ripples
and
not
at
the
mighty
sea
we
like
boats
are
tossed
hither
and
thither
we
are
blind
though
we
are
on
the
bright
ocean
ah
you
who
are

behold
the

under
the

there
is
another
water
moving
it
within
the
spirit
is
a
spirit
that
calls
it
when
you
have
accepted
the
light
o
beloved
when
you
behold
what
is
veiled
without
a
veil
like
a
star
you
will
walk
upon
the
heavens
where
love
is
a
damsel
said
to
her
lover
o
fond
youth
you
have
visited
many
cities
in
your
travels
which
of
those
cities
seems
most
delightful
to
you
he
made
answer
the
city
wherein
my
love
dwells
in
whatever
nook
my
queen
alights
though
it
be
as
the
eye
of
a
needle
is
a
wide
plain
wherever
her
face
shines
as
a
moon
though
it
be
the
bottom
of
a

with
thee
my

hell
itself
were

with
thee
a

with
thee
hell
would
be
a
mansion
of
delight
without
thee
lilies
and
roses
would
be
as
flames
of
fire
the
love
of
the
beloved
no
lover
ever
seeks
union
with
his
beloved
but
his
beloved
is
also
seeking
union
with
him
but
the
lover
love
makes
his
body
lean
while
the
beloved
love
makes
her
fair
and
lusty
when
in
heart
the
lightning
spark
of
love
arises
be
sure
this
love
is
reciprocated
in
heart
when
the
love
of
god
arises
in
thy
heart
without
doubt
god
also
feels
love
for
thee
the
love
of
the
soul
and
the
love
of
the
body
the
love
of
the
soul
is
for
life
and
the
living
one
because
its
origin
is
the
soul
not
bound
to
place
the
love
of
the
soul
is
for
wisdom
and
knowledge
that
of
the
body
for
houses
gardens
and
the
love
of
the
soul
is
for
things
exalted
on
high
that
of
the
body
for
acquisition
of
goods
and
food
the
love
too
of
him
on
high
is
directed
to
the
soul
know
this
for
he
loves
them
that
love
him
the
sum
is
this
that
whoso
seeks
another
the
soul
of
that
other
who
is
sought
inclines
to
him
o
love
love
and
heart

israfil
of
the
of

and

let
thy
first
boon
to
me
be
this
to
lend
thine
ear
to
my
orisons
though
thou
knowest
my
condition
clearly
o
protector
of
slaves
listen
to
my
speech
a
thousand
times
o
prince
incomparable
has
my
reason
taken
flight
in
desire
to
see
thee
and
to
hear
thee
and
to
listen
to
thy
words
and
to
behold
thy
smiles
thy
inclining
thine
ear
to
my
supplications
is
as
a
caress
to
my
misguided
soul
destroy
not
earthly
beauty
it
beautifies
the
soul
tear
not
thy
plumage
off
it
can
not
be
replaced
disfigure
not
thy
face
in
wantonness
o
fair
one
that
face
which
is
bright
as
the
forenoon
sun
to
disfigure
it
were
a
grievous
sin
paganism
to
mar
such
a
face
as
thine
the
moon
itself
would
weep
to
lose
sight
of
it
knowest
thou
not
the
beauty
of
thine
own
face
quit
this
temper
that
leads
thee
to
war
with
thyself
it
is
the
claws
of
thine
own
foolish
thoughts
that
in
spite
wound
the
face
of
thy
quiet
soul
know
such
thoughts
to
be
claws
fraught
with
poison
which
score
deep
wounds
on
the
face
of
thy
soul
the
devil
makes
use
of
the
beauty
of
women
thus
spake
cursed
iblis
to
the
almighty
i
want
a
mighty
trap
to
catch
human
game
withal
god
gave
him
gold
and
silver
and
troops
and
horses
saying
you
can
catch
my
creatures
with
these
iblis
said
bravo
but
at
the
same
time
hung
his
lip
and
frowned
sourly
like
a
bitter
orange
then
god
offered
gold
and
jewels
from
precious
mines
to
that
laggard
in
the
faith
saying
take
these
other
traps
o
cursed
one
but
iblis
said
give
me
more
o
blessed
defender
god
gave
him
succulent
and
sweet
and
costly
wines
and
also
store
of
silken
garments
but
iblis
said
o
lord
i
want
more
aids
than
these
in
order
to
bind
men
in
my
twisted
rope
so
firmly
that
thy
adorers
who
are
valiant
men
may
not
break
my
bonds
asunder
when
at
last
god
showed
him
the
beauty
of
women
which
bereaves
men
of
reason
and
then
iblis
clapped
his
hands
and
began
to
dance
saying
give
me
these
i
shall
quickly
prevail
with
these
lovers
and
beloved
have
both
perished
lovers
and
beloved
have
both
perished
and
not
themselves
only
but
their
love
as
well
is
god
alone
who
agitates
these
nonentities
making
one
nonentity
fall
in
love
with
another
in
the
heart
that
is
no
heart
envy
comes
to
a
head
thus
being
troubles
nonentity
o
angels
bring
him
back
to
me
o
angels
bring
him
back
to
me
since
the
eyes
of
his
heart
were
set
on
hope
without
care
for
consequence
i
set
him
free
and
draw
the
pen
through
the
record
of
his
sins
and
vainglory
no
part
of
love
a
lover
was
once
admitted
to
the
presence
of
his
mistress
but
instead
of
embracing
her
he
pulled
out
a
paper
of
sonnets
and
read
them
to
her
describing
her
perfections
and
charms
and
his
own
love
towards
her
at
length
his
mistress
said
to
him
you
are
now
in
my
presence
and
these
sighs
and
invocations
are
a
waste
of
time
it
is
not
the
part
of
a
true
lover
to
waste
his
time
in
this
way
it
shows
that
i
am
not
the
real
object
of
your
affection
but
that
what
you
really
love
is
your
own
effusions
and
ecstatic
raptures
i
see
as
it
were
the
water
which
i
have
longed
for
before
me
and
yet
you
withhold
it
i
am
as
it
were
in
bulgaria
and
the
object
of
your
love
is
in
cathay
one
who
is
really
loved
is
the
single
object
of
her
lover
the
alpha
and
omega
of
his
desires
as
for
you
you
are
wrapped
up
in
your
own
amorous
raptures
depending
on
the
varying
states
of
your
own
feelings
instead
of
being
wrapped
up
in
me
i
am
thine
and
thou
art
mine
eternal
life
is
gained
by
utter
abandonment
of
own
life
when
god
appears
to
his
ardent
lover
the
lover
is
absorbed
in
him
and
not
so
much
as
a
hair
of
the
lover
remains
true
lovers
are
as
shadows
and
when
the
sun
shines
in
glory
the
shadows
vanish
away
he
is
a
true
lover
to
god
to
whom
god
says
i
am
thine
and
thou
art
mine
love
needs
no
mediator
when
one
has
attained
union
with
god
he
has
no
need
of
intermediaries
prophets
and
apostles
are
needed
as
links
to
connect
ordinary
man
with
god
but
he
who
hears
the
inner
voice
within
him
has
no
need
to
listen
to
outward
words
even
of
apostles
although
that
intercession
is
himself
dwelling
in
god
yet
my
state
is
higher
and
more
lovely
than
his
though
he
is
god
agent
yet
i
desire
not
his
intercession
to
save
me
from
evil
sent
me
by
god
for
evil
at
god
hand
seems
to
me
good
what
seems
mercy
and
kindness
to
the
vulgar
seems
wrath
and
vengeance
to
saints
humanity
the
reflection
of
the
beloved
parrots
are
taught
to
speak
without
understanding
the
words
the
method
is
to
place
a
mirror
between
the
parrot
and
the
trainer
the
trainer
hidden
by
the
mirror
utters
the
words
and
the
parrot
seeing
his
own
reflection
in
the
mirror
fancies
another
parrot
is
speaking
and
imitates
all
that
is
said
by
the
trainer
behind
the
mirror
so
god
uses
prophets
and
saints
as
mirrors
whereby
to
instruct
men
the
bodies
of
these
saints
and
prophets
and
men
when
they
hear
the
words
proceeding
from
these
mirrors
are
utterly
ignorant
that
they
are
really
being
spoken
by
universal
reason
or
the
word
of
god
behind
the
mirror
of
the
saints
earthly
forms
earthly
forms
are
only
shadows
of
the
sun
of
truth
a
cradle
for
babes
but
too
small
to
hold
those
who
have
grown
to
spiritual
manhood
the
beatific
vision
of
eternal
truth
the
end
and
object
of
all
negation
is
to
attain
to
subsequent
affirmation
as
the
negation
in
the
creed
there
is
no
god
finds
its
complement
and
purpose
in
the
affirmation
but
god
just
so
the
purpose
of
negation
of
self
is
to
clear
the
way
for
the
apprehension
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
existence
but
the
one
the
intoxication
of
life
and
its
pleasures
and
occupations
veils
the
truth
from
eyes
and
they
ought
to
pass
on
to
the
spiritual
intoxication
which
makes
men
beside
themselves
and
lifts
them
to
the
beatific
vision
of
eternal
truth
the
wine
everlasting
o
babbler
while
thy
soul
is
drunk
with
mere
date
wine
thy
spirit
hath
not
tasted
the
genuine
grapes
for
the
token
of
thy
having
seen
that
divine
light
is
this
to
withdraw
thyself
from
the
house
of
pride
be
lost
in
the
beauty
of
the
beloved
when
those
egyptian
women
sacrificed
their
reason
they
penetrated
the
mansion
of
joseph
love
the
of
life
bore
away
their
reason
they
were
filled
with
wisdom
of
the
world
without
end
joseph
beauty
was
only
an
offshoot
of
god
beauty
be
lost
then
in
god
beauty
more
than
those
women
what
ear
has
told
you
falsely
what
ear
has
told
you
falsely
eye
will
tell
truly
then
ear
too
will
acquire
the
properties
of
an
eye
your
ears
now
worthless
as
wool
will
become
gems
yea
your
whole
body
will
become
a
mirror
it
will
be
as
an
eye
of
a
bright
gem
in
your
bosom
first
the
hearing
of
the
ear
enables
you
to
form
ideas
then
these
ideas
guide
you
to
the
beloved
strive
then
to
increase
the
number
of
these
ideas
that
they
may
guide
you
like
majnun
to
the
beloved
there
is
a
place
of
refuge
yea
o
sleeping
heart
know
the
kingdom
that
endures
not
for
ever
and
ever
is
only
a
mere
dream
i
marvel
how
long
you
will
indulge
in
vain
illusion
which
has
seized
you
by
the
throat
like
a
heads
man
know
that
even
in
this
world
there
is
a
place
of
refuge
hearken
not
to
the
unbeliever
who
denies
it
his
argument
is
this
he
says
again
and
again
if
there
were
aught
beyond
this
life
we
should
see
it
but
if
the
child
see
not
the
state
of
reason
does
the
man
of
reason
therefore
forsake
reason
and
if
the
man
of
reason
sees
not
the
state
of
love
is
the
blessed
moon
of
love
thereby
eclipsed
the
lover
cry
to
the
beloved
my
back
is
broken
by
the
conflict
of
my
thoughts
o
beloved
one
come
and
stroke
my
head
in
mercy
the
palm
of
thy
hand
on
my
head
gives
me
rest
thy
hand
is
a
sign
of
thy
bounteous
providence
remove
not
thy
shadow
from
my
head
i
am
afflicted
afflicted
afflicted
sleep
has
deserted
my
eyes
through
my
longing
for
thee
o
envy
of
cypresses
o
take
my
life
thou
art
the
source
of
life
for
apart
from
thee
i
am
wearied
of
my
life
i
am
a
lover
well
versed
in
lovers
madness
i
am
weary
of
learning
and
sense
sorrow
turned
to
joy
he
who
extracts
the
rose
from
the
thorn
can
also
turn
this
winter
into
spring
he
who
exalts
the
heads
of
the
cypresses
is
able
also
out
of
sadness
to
bring
joy
the
gifts
of
the
beloved
where
will
you
find
one
more
liberal
than
god
he
buys
the
worthless
rubbish
which
is
your
wealth
he
pays
you
the
light
that
illumines
your
heart
he
accepts
these
frozen
and
lifeless
bodies
of
yours
and
gives
you
a
kingdom
beyond
what
you
dream
of
he
takes
a
few
drops
of
your
tears
and
gives
you
the
divine
fount
sweeter
than
sugar
he
takes
your
sighs
fraught
with
grief
and
sadness
and
for
each
sigh
gives
rank
in
heaven
as
interest
in
return
for
the
that
raised
god
gave
abraham
the
title
of
father
of
the
faithful

art
hidden

though
the

the

to
the

is
a
learning
beyond
the

of

the

of

names
so
that
his
glory
reached
the

he
laid

dooms
to

white

every

thou
freest
our

from

the

after
its
destruction
he
builds
it
anew

the
soul
who
for
love
of
god
has
lavished
family
wealth
and
goods
has
destroyed
its
house
to
find
the
hidden
treasure
and
with
that
treasure
has
rebuilt
it
in

sort
has
dammed
up

cleansed

then
turned

watch
the

regard
it
well
it
may
be
by

thou
wilt
recognise

face
as
there
are
many
demons
with

faces
it
is
wrong
to
join
hand
with
every
one
when
the
fowler
sounds
his
decoy
whistle
that
the
birds
may
be
beguiled
by
that
snare
the
birds
hear
that
call
simulating
a
bird
call
and
descending
from
the

find
net
and
knife
so
vile
hypocrites
steal
the
language
of
dervishes
in
order
to
beguile
the
simple
with
their
trickery
the
works
of
the
righteous
are
light
and
heat
the
works
of
the
evil
treachery
and
shamelessness
they
make
stuffed
lions
to
scare
the
simple
they
give
the
title
of
muhammad
to
false
musailima
but
musailima
retained
the
name
of
liar
and
muhammad
that
of
sublimest
of
beings
that
wine
of
god
the
righteous
yields
a
perfume
of
musk
other
wine
the
evil
is
reserved
for
penalties
and
pains
harshness
and
adoration
let
me
then
i
say
make
complaint
of
the
severity
of
that
fickle
fair
one
i
cry
and
my
cries
sound
sweet
in
his
ear
he
requires
from
the
two
worlds
cries
and
groans
how
shall
i
not
wail
under
his
chastening
hand
how
shall
i
not
be
in
the
number
of
those
bewitched
by
him
how
shall
i
be
other
than
night
without
his
day
without
the
vision
of
his
face
that
illumes
the
day
his
bitters
are
very
sweets
to
my
soul
i
am
enamoured
of
my
own
grief
and
pain
for
it
makes
me
to
my
peerless
king
i
use
the
dust
of
my
grief
as
salve
for
my
eyes
that
my
eyes
like
seas
may
team
with
pearls
the
divine
absorption
do
me
justice
o
thou
who
art
the
glory
of
the
just
who
art
the
throne
and
i
the
lintel
of
thy
door
but
in
sober
truth
where
are
throne
and
where
are
we
and
i
there
where
our
beloved
is
o
thou
who
art
exempt
from
us
and
me
who
pervadest
the
spirits
of
all
men
and
women
when
man
and
woman
become
one
thou
art
that
one
when
their
union
is
dissolved
lo
thou
abidest
thou
hast
made
these
us
and
me
for
this
purpose
to
wit
to
play
chess
with
them
by
thyself
when
thou
shalt
become
one
entity
with
us
and
you
then
wilt
thou
show
true
affection
for
these
lovers
when
these
we
and
ye
shall
all
become
one
soul
then
they
will
be
lost
and
absorbed
in
the
beloved
love
more
than
sorrow
and
joy
come
then
o
lord
who
art
exalted
above
description
and
explanation
is
it
possible
for
the
bodily
eye
to
behold
thee
can
mind
of
man
conceive
thy
frowns
and
thy
smiles
are
hearts
when
bewitched
by
thy
smiles
and
frowns
in
a
fit
state
to
see
the
vision
of
thyself
when
our
hearts
are
bewitched
by
thy
smiles
and
frowns
can
we
gain
life
from
these
two
alternating
states
the
fertile
garden
of
love
as
it
is
boundless
contains
other
fruits
besides
joy
and
sorrow
the
true
lover
is
exalted
above
these
two
states
he
is
fresh
and
green
independently
of
autumn
or
spring
pay
tithe
on
thy
beauty
o
beauteous
one
tell
forth
the
tale
of
the
beloved
every
whit
the
heart
of
the
harper
the
heart
of
the
harper
was
emancipated
like
a
soul
he
was
freed
from
weeping
and
rejoicing
his
old
life
died
and
he
was
regenerated
amazement
fell
upon
him
at
that
moment
for
he
was
exalted
above
earth
and
heaven
an
uplifting
of
the
heart
surpassing
all
uplifting
i
can
not
describe
it
if
you
can
say
on
ecstasy
and
words
beyond
all
ecstatic
words
immersion
in
the
glory
of
the
lord
of
glory
immersion
wherefrom
was
no
extrication
as
it
were
identification
with
the
very
ocean
when
night
returns
when
night
returns
and
is
the

the

that
were

come
forth
to
their
work
the
people
of

lie
unconscious
with
veils
drawn
over
their
faces
and
asleep
but
when
the
morn
shall
burst
forth
and
the
sun
arise
every
creature
will
raise
its
head
from
its
couch
to
the
unconscious
god
will
restore
consciousness
they
will
stand
in
rings
as
slaves
with
rings
in
ears
dancing
and
clapping
hands
with
songs
of
praise
singing
with
joy
our
lord
hath
restored
us
to
life
separation
nothing
is
bitterer
than
severance
from
thee
without
thy
shelter
there
is
naught
but
perplexity
our
worldly
goods
rob
us
of
our
heavenly
goods
our
body
rends
the
garment
of
our
soul
our
hands
as
it
were
prey
on
our
feet
without

on
thee
how
can
we

in

straightway
the
burden
will
fall
from

and
superficialities

what

in
thy

the
flame
of
love
and
burn
up
utterly
thoughts
and
fine
expressions
o
moses
the
lovers
of
fair
rites
are
one
class
they
whose
hearts
and
souls
burn
with
love
another
a
mother
whose
children
were
in
the
beloved
keeping
a
woman
bore
many
children
in
succession
but
none
of
them
lived
beyond
the
age
of
three
or
four
months
in
great
distress
she
cried
to
god
and
then
beheld
in
a
vision
the
beautiful
gardens
of
paradise
and
many
fair
mansions
therein
and
upon
one
of
these
mansions
she
read
her
own
name
inscribed
and
a
voice
from
heaven
informed
her
that
god
would
accept
the
sorrows
she
had
endured
in
lieu
of
her
blood
shed
in
holy
war
as
owing
to
her
sex
she
was
unable
to
go
out
to
battle
like
the
men
on
looking
again
the
woman
beheld
in
paradise
all
the
children
she
had
lost
and
she
cried
o
lord
they
were
lost
to
me
but
safe
with
thee
the
optimistic
rose
in
this
tale
there
is
a
warning
for
thee
o
soul
that
thou
mayest
acquiesce
in
god
ordinances
and
be
wary
and
not
doubt
god
benevolence
when
sudden
misfortune
befalls
thee
let
others
grow
pale
from
fear
of
ill
fortune
do
thou
smile
like
the
rose
at
loss
and
gain
for
the
rose
though
its
petals
be
torn
asunder
still
smiles
on
and
it
is
never
cast
down
the
true
mosque
fools
laud
and
magnify
the
mosque
while
they
strive
to
oppress
holy
men
of
heart
but
the
former
is
mere
form
the
latter
spirit
and
truth
the
only
true
mosque
is
that
in
the
hearts
of
saints
the
mosque
that
is
built
in
the
hearts
of
the
saints
is
the
place
of
worship
of
all
for
god
dwells
there
so
long
as
the
hearts
of
the
saints
are
not
afflicted
god
never
destroys
the
nation
ignorance
blood
is
impure
yet
its
stain
is
removed
by
water
but
that
impurity
of
ignorance
is
more
lasting
seeing
that
without
the
blessed
water
of
god
it
is
not
banished
from
the
man
who
is
subject
to
it
o
that
thou
wouldst
turn
thy
face
to
thy
own
prayers
and
say
ah
my
prayers
are
as
defective
as
my
being
o
requite
me
good
for
evil
a
prayer
pray
in
this
wise
and
allay
your
difficulties
us
good
in
the
house
of
our
present
world
and
give
us
good
in
the
house
of
our
next
world
make
our
path
pleasant
as
a
garden
and
be
thou
o
holy
one
our
goal
all
religions
are
one
in
the
adorations
and
benedictions
of
righteous
men
the
praises
of
all
the
prophets
are
kneaded
together
all
their
praises
are
mingled
into
one
stream
all
the
vessels
are
emptied
into
one
ewer
because
he
that
is
praised
is
in
fact
only
one
in
this
respect
all
religions
are
only
one
religion
because
all
praises
are
directed
towards
god

the
meaning
of
this
poem
is
strictly
allegorical
we
must
not
infer
that
the
would
be
a
party
to
the
evil
designs
of
the
devil
no
material
gifts
however
seductive
could
succeed
in
stamping
out
the
divine
presence
in
his
creatures
footnote
at
first
sight
there
seems
to
be
omarian
pessimism
in
this
poem
in
reality
it
signifies
that
all
love
is
one
which
shines
through
the
lanterns
of
the

nīzamī
discourse

nīzamī
chahár
four
discourses
translated
by
professor
edward
browne
we
find
the
devoted
to
the
nature
of
poetry
and
the
utility
of
the
skilful
poet
in
this
interesting
discourse
nīzamī
very
amiably
discusses
the
training
required
to
become
a
poet
of
enduring
fame
and
intersperses
these
remarks
with
a
number
of
anecdotes
which
in
the
main
are
examples
of
the
advantages
derived
from
poetic
improvisations
given
at
opportune
moments
before
kings
when
wine
has
gone
round
two
or
three
times
nīzamī
sums
up
the
nature
of
poetry
in
the
following
words
poetry
is
that
art
whereby
the
poet
arranges
imaginary
propositions
and
adapts
the
deductions
with
the
result
that
he
can
make
a
little
thing
appear
great
and
a
great
thing
small
or
cause
good
to
appear
in
the
garb
of
evil
and
evil
in
the
garb
of
good
nīzamī
denounces
the
habit
of
giving
money
to
old
poets
he
remarks
for
one
so
ignoble
as
not
to
have
discovered
in
fifty
years
that
what
he
writes
is
bad
when
will
he
discover
it
on
the
other
hand
nīzamī
favours
the
young
poet
with
hopeful
talent
and
generously
remarks
that
it
is
proper
to
patronise
him
a
duty
to
take
care
of
him
and
an
obligation
to
maintain
him
the
minor
poets
of
have
not
these
glowing
advantages
the
most
ingenious
example
of
a
poetic
improvisation
in
this
is
perhaps
one
given
by
rúdagí
in
connection
with
the
protracted
stay
of
amír
nasr
ahmad
in
herát
four
years
the
amír
camped
with
his
army
in
this
town
with
its
twenty
different
varieties
of
grape
and
beautiful
narcissus
he
preferred
herát
to
the
garden
of
eden
but
at
length
the
amír
captains
and
courtiers
grew
weary
of
being
absent
so
long
from
bukhárá
where
they
longed
to
see
their
wives
and
children
again
they
offered
rúdagí
the
poet
five
thousand
dinars
if
he
could
persuade
the
amír
to
quit
herát
and
return
to
bukhárá
rúdagí
at
an
opportune
moment
took
up
his
harp
and
sang
the
following
song
to
the
amír
the
sands
of
oxus
toilsome
though
they
be
beneath
my
feet
were
soft
as
silk
to
me
glad
at
the
friend
return
the
oxus
deep
up
to
our
girths
in
laughing
waves
shall
leap
long
live
bukhárá
be
thou
of
good
cheer
joyous
towards
thee
hasteth
our
amír
the
moon
the
prince
bukhárá
is
the
sky
o
sky
the
moon
shall
light
thee
by
and
bye
bukhárá
is
the
mead
the
cypress
he
receive
at
last
o
mead
thy
this
particular
amír
seems
to
have
been
fond
of
flattery
and
he
found
the
daintily
turned
song
of
rúdagí
more
acceptable
to
his
vanity
than
even
the
beauty
of
herát
he
accordingly
took
his
departure
immediately
the
song
had
concluded
and
in
his
forgot
to
put
on
his
boots
which
were
carried
by
an
attendant
who
rode
in
hot
pursuit
poetry
in
those
days
was
evidently
a
remunerative
pursuit
nīzamī
tells
us
that
khidr
khán
always
had
in
readiness
four
trays
of
gold
these
he
used
to
dispense
by
the
handful
to
the
successful
poets
though
the
royal
favour
towards
the
poets
was
extremely
bountiful
persian
poets
were
not
always
particularly
courteous
the
one
to
the
other
nīzamī
tells
an
amusing
story
of
a
minor
poet
named
rashídí
at
the
king
command
the
was
asked
to
express
his
opinion
of
rashídí
poetry
the
accordingly
remarked
his
verse
is
extremely
good
and
chaste
and
correct
but
it
wants
spice
the
king
afterwards
repeated
these
words
to
rashídí
and
bade
him
compose
a
fitting
rejoinder
rashídí
composed
the
following
verse
you
stigmatise
my
verse
as
wanting
spice
and
possibly
my
friend
you
may
be
right
my
verse
is
and
spice
with
such
could
scarcely
cause
delight
spice
is
for
you
you
blackguard
not
for
me
for
beans
and
turnips
is
the
stuff
you
write
this
was
not
kind
but
rashídí
received
all
four
baskets
of
gold
that
day
the
technical
study
of
prosody
was
instituted
by
khalil
ibn
i
ahmad
i
bicrí
he
is
said
to
have
discovered
this
science
by
listening
to
the
rythmic
beats
of
the
fuller
mallets
upon
his
clothes
this
story
is
mentioned
in
saifi
on
much
of
persian
poetry
is
conventional
and
the
demarcation
in
style
due
to
the
various
phases
of
persian
history
is
not
as
pronounced
as
might
be
expected
the
persian
poets
not
only
conservatively
followed
old
metres
but
old
similes
old
subjects
as
well
it
was
with
words
they
were
most
concerned
and
not
with
ideas
the
of
rámí
is
sufficient
to
prove
this
the
book
contains
a
very
large
number
of
similes
on
the
various
parts
of
the
body
this
was
intended
to
be
a
to
the
writer
of
erotic
poetry
professor
brown
defends
this
conservatism
and
remarks
that
it
has
guarded
the
persian
language
from
the
vulgarisation
which
the
triumph
of
an
untrained
untrammelled
and
unconventional
genius
of
the
type
tends
to
produce
in
our
own
and
other
european
tongues
