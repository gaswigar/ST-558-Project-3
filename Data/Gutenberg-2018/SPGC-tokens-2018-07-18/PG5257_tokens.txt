the
broad
highway
by
jeffery
farnol
to
shirley
byron
jevons
the
friend
of
my
boyish
ambitions
this
book
is
dedicated
as
a
mark
of
my
gratitude
affection
and
esteem
ante
scriptum
as
i
sat
of
an
early
summer
morning
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
eating
fried
bacon
with
a
tinker
the
thought
came
to
me
that
i
might
some
day
write
a
book
of
my
own
a
book
that
should
treat
of
the
roads
and
of
trees
and
wind
in
lonely
places
of
rapid
brooks
and
lazy
streams
of
the
glory
of
dawn
the
glow
of
evening
and
the
purple
solitude
of
night
a
book
of
wayside
inns
and
sequestered
taverns
a
book
of
country
things
and
ways
and
people
and
the
thought
pleased
me
much
but
objected
the
tinker
for
i
had
spoken
my
thought
aloud
trees
and
suchlike
do
sound
very
interestin
leastways
not
in
a
book
for
after
all
a
tree
only
a
tree
and
an
inn
an
inn
no
you
must
tell
of
other
things
as
well
yes
said
i
a
little
damped
to
be
sure
there
is
a
highwayman
come
that
better
said
the
tinker
encouragingly
then
i
went
on
ticking
off
each
item
on
my
fingers
come
tom
cragg
the
pugilist
better
and
better
nodded
the
a
soldier
of
the
peninsula
an
adventure
at
a
lonely
tavern
a
flight
through
woods
at
midnight
pursued
by
desperate
villains
and
a
most
extraordinary
tinker
so
far
so
good
i
think
and
it
all
sounds
adventurous
enough
what
cried
the
tinker
would
you
put
me
in
your
book
then
assuredly
why
then
said
the
tinker
it
true
i
mends
kettles
sharpens
scissors
and
such
but
i
likewise
peddles
books
an
an
more
i
reads
so
if
you
must
put
me
in
your
book
you
might
call
me
a
literary
cove
a
literary
cove
said
i
ah
said
the
tinker
it
sounds
better
a
sight
better
besides
i
never
read
a
with
a
tinker
in
it
as
i
remember
generally
dooks
or
earls
or
barronites
nobody
wants
to
read
about
a
tinker
that
all
depends
said
i
a
tinker
may
be
much
more
interesting
than
an
earl
or
even
a
duke
the
tinker
examined
the
piece
of
bacon
upon
his
knifepoint
with
a
cold
and
disparaging
eye
i
read
a
good
many
in
my
time
said
he
shaking
his
head
and
i
knows
what
i
talking
of
here
he
bolted
the
morsel
of
bacon
with
much
apparent
relish
i
made
love
to
duchesses
run
off
with
heiresses
and
fought
dooels
ah
by
the
hundred
all
between
the
covers
of
some
book
or
other
and
enjoyed
it
uncommonly
well
especially
the
dooels
if
you
can
get
a
little
blood
into
your
book
so
much
the
better
there
nothing
like
a
little
blood
in
a
book
not
a
great
deal
but
just
enough
to
give
it
a
so
to
speak
if
you
could
kill
your
highwayman
to
start
with
it
would
be
a
very
good
beginning
to
your
story
i
could
do
that
certainly
said
i
but
it
would
not
be
according
to
fact
so
much
the
better
said
the
tinker
who
wants
facts
in
a
hum
said
i
and
then
again
what
more
i
inquired
love
said
the
tinker
wiping
his
on
the
leg
of
his
breeches
love
i
repeated
and
plenty
of
it
said
the
tinker
i
afraid
that
is
impossible
said
i
after
a
moment
thought
how
impossible
because
i
know
nothing
about
love
that
a
pity
said
the
tinker
under
the
circumstances
it
is
said
i
not
a
doubt
of
it
said
the
tinker
beginning
to
scrub
out
the
with
a
handful
of
grass
though
to
be
sure
you
might
learn
you
young
enough
yes
i
might
learn
said
i
who
knows
ah
who
knows
said
the
tinker
and
after
he
had
cleansed
the
pan
to
his
satisfaction
he
turned
to
me
with
dexter
finger
upraised
and
brow
of
heavy
portent
young
fellow
said
he
no
man
can
write
a
good
without
he
knows
summat
about
love
it
are
to
be
expected
so
the
sooner
you
do
learn
the
better
hum
said
i
and
then
as
i
said
afore
and
i
say
it
again
they
wants
love
in
a
book
nowadays
and
wot
more
they
will
have
it
they
said
i
the
folk
as
will
read
your
book
after
it
is
written
ah
to
be
sure
said
i
somewhat
taken
aback
i
had
forgotten
them
forgotten
them
repeated
the
tinker
staring
forgotten
that
people
might
went
to
read
it
after
it
is
written
but
said
the
tinker
rubbing
his
nose
hard
books
are
written
for
people
to
read
are
they
not
always
said
hereupon
the
tinker
rubbed
his
nose
harder
than
ever
many
of
the
world
greatest
books
those
masterpieces
which
have
lived
and
shall
live
on
forever
were
written
as
i
believe
for
the
pure
love
of
writing
them
oh
said
the
tinker
yes
said
i
warming
to
my
theme
and
with
little
or
no
idea
of
the
eyes
of
those
unborn
generations
which
were
to
read
and
marvel
at
them
hence
it
is
we
get
those
sublime
thoughts
untrammelled
by
passing
tastes
and
fashions
unbounded
by
narrow
creed
or
popular
prejudice
ah
said
the
tinker
many
a
great
writer
has
been
spoiled
by
fashion
and
success
for
so
soon
as
he
begins
to
think
upon
his
public
how
best
to
please
and
hold
their
fancy
which
is
ever
the
most
fickle
of
mundane
things
straightway
genius
spreads
abroad
his
pinions
and
leaves
him
in
the
mire
poor
cove
said
the
tinker
young
man
you
smile
i
think
no
said
i
well
supposing
a
writer
never
had
no
how
then
why
then
said
i
he
should
never
dare
to
write
at
all
young
fellow
said
the
tinker
glancing
at
me
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
are
you
sure
you
are
a
then
now
when
my
companion
said
this
i
fell
silent
for
the
very
sufficient
reason
that
i
found
nothing
to
say
lord
love
you
said
he
at
last
seeing
me
thus
hipped
do
be
downhearted
do
be
dashed
afore
you
begin
we
ca
all
be
it
are
to
be
expected
but
some
on
us
is
a
good
deal
better
than
most
and
that
something
arter
all
as
for
your
book
wot
you
have
to
do
is
to
give
a
little
blood
now
and
then
with
plenty
of
love
and
you
ca
go
far
wrong
now
whether
the
tinker
theory
for
the
writing
of
a
good
novel
be
right
or
wrong
i
will
not
presume
to
say
but
in
this
book
that
lies
before
you
though
you
shall
read
if
you
choose
of
country
things
and
ways
and
people
yet
because
that
part
of
my
life
herein
recorded
was
a
something
hard
rough
life
you
shall
read
also
of
blood
and
because
i
came
in
the
end
to
love
very
greatly
so
shall
you
read
of
love
wherefore
then
i
am
emboldened
to
hope
that
when
you
shall
have
turned
the
last
page
and
closed
this
book
you
shall
do
so
with
a
sigh
london
book
one
chapter
i
chiefly
concerning
my
uncle
last
will
and
testament
to
my
nephew
maurice
vibart
i
bequeath
the
sum
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
in
the
fervent
hope
that
it
may
help
him
to
the
devil
within
the
year
or
as
soon
after
as
may
be
here
grainger
paused
in
his
reading
to
glance
up
over
the
rim
of
his
spectacles
while
sir
richard
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
loudly
gad
he
exclaimed
still
chuckling
i
give
a
hundred
pounds
if
he
could
have
been
present
to
hear
that
and
the
baronet
went
off
into
another
roar
of
merriment
grainger
on
the
other
hand
dignified
and
solemn
coughed
a
short
dry
cough
behind
his
hand
help
him
to
the
devil
within
the
year
repeated
sir
richard
still
chuckling
pray
proceed
sir
said
i
motioning
towards
the
will
but
instead
of
complying
grainger
laid
down
the
parchment
and
removing
his
spectacles
began
to
polish
them
with
a
large
silk
handkerchief
you
are
i
believe
unacquainted
with
your
cousin
sir
maurice
vibart
he
inquired
i
have
never
seen
him
said
i
all
my
life
has
been
passed
either
at
school
or
the
university
but
i
have
frequently
heard
mention
of
him
nevertheless
egad
cried
sir
richard
who
has
heard
of
buck
vibart
beat
ted
jarraway
of
swansea
in
five
rounds
drove
coach
and
four
down
whitehall
on
sidewalk
ran
away
with
a
french
marquise
while
but
a
boy
of
twenty
and
shot
her
husband
into
the
bargain
devilish
celebrated
figure
in
circles
friend
of
the
prince
regent
so
i
understand
said
i
altogether
as
complete
a
young
blackguard
as
ever
swaggered
down
st
james
having
said
which
sir
richard
crossed
his
legs
and
inhaled
a
pinch
of
snuff
twenty
thousand
pounds
is
a
very
handsome
sum
remarked
grainger
ponderously
and
as
though
more
with
the
intention
of
saying
something
rather
than
remain
silent
just
then
indeed
it
is
said
i
and
might
help
a
man
to
the
devil
as
comfortably
as
need
be
but
though
pursued
grainger
much
below
his
expectations
and
sadly
inadequate
to
his
present
needs
i
fear
that
is
most
unfortunate
said
i
but
his
debts
said
grainger
busy
at
his
spectacles
again
his
debts
are
very
heavy
i
believe
then
doubtless
some
arrangement
can
be
made
to
but
continue
your
reading
i
beg
said
grainger
repeated
his
short
dry
cough
and
taking
up
the
will
slowly
and
almost
as
though
unwillingly
cleared
his
throat
and
began
as
follows
to
my
nephew
peter
vibart
cousin
to
the
above
i
will
and
bequeath
my
blessing
and
the
sum
of
ten
guineas
in
cash
wherewith
to
purchase
a
copy
of
zeno
or
any
other
of
the
stoic
philosophers
he
may
prefer
again
grainger
laid
down
the
will
and
again
he
regarded
me
over
the
rim
of
his
spectacles
good
god
cried
sir
richard
leaping
to
his
feet
the
man
must
have
been
mad
ten
guineas
why
it
an
insult
damme
it
an
insult
you
never
take
it
of
course
peter
on
the
contrary
sir
said
i
but
ten
guineas
bellowed
the
baronet
on
my
soul
now
george
was
a
fish
but
i
did
think
even
he
was
capable
of
such
a
despicable
trick
no
curse
me
if
i
did
why
it
would
have
been
kinder
to
have
left
you
nothing
at
all
but
it
was
like
george
bitter
to
the
end
ten
guineas
is
ten
guineas
said
i
and
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
much
may
be
done
with
ten
guineas
sir
richard
grew
purple
in
the
face
but
before
he
could
speak
grainger
began
to
read
again
the
sum
of
five
hundred
thousand
pounds
now
vested
in
the
funds
shall
be
paid
to
either
maurice
or
peter
vibart
aforesaid
if
either
shall
within
one
calendar
year
become
the
husband
of
the
lady
sophia
sefton
of
cambourne
good
god
exclaimed
sir
richard
which
read
grainger
said
sum
namely
five
hundred
thousand
pounds
shall
be
bestowed
upon
such
charity
or
charities
as
the
trustees
shall
select
signed
by
me
this
tenth
day
of
april
eighteen
hundred
and
george
vibrart
duly
witnessed
by
adam
penfleet
martha
trent
here
grainger
voice
stopped
and
i
remember
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
parchment
crackled
very
loudly
as
he
folded
it
precisely
and
laid
it
on
the
table
before
him
i
remember
also
that
sir
richard
was
swearing
vehemently
under
his
breath
as
he
paced
to
and
fro
between
me
and
the
window
and
that
is
all
i
inquired
at
last
that
said
grainger
not
looking
at
me
now
is
all
the
lady
sophia
murmured
sir
richard
as
if
to
himself
the
lady
sophia
and
then
stopping
suddenly
before
me
in
his
walk
oh
peter
said
he
clapping
his
hand
down
upon
my
shoulder
oh
peter
that
settles
it
you
done
for
boy
a
crueller
will
was
never
made
marriage
said
i
to
myself
hum
a
damnable
iniquity
exclaimed
sir
richard
striding
up
and
down
the
room
again
the
lady
sophia
sefton
of
cambourne
said
i
rubbing
my
chin
why
that
just
it
roared
the
baronet
she
a
reigning
toast
most
famous
beauty
in
the
country
london
mad
over
her
she
can
pick
and
choose
from
all
the
finest
gentlemen
in
england
oh
to
all
your
hopes
of
the
inheritance
peter
and
that
the
devil
of
it
sir
i
fail
to
see
your
argument
said
i
what
cried
sir
richard
facing
round
on
me
think
you
have
a
chance
with
her
then
why
not
without
friends
position
of
money
pish
boy
do
i
tell
you
that
every
buck
and
dandy
every
mincing
macaroni
in
the
three
kingdoms
would
give
his
very
legs
to
marry
her
either
for
her
beauty
or
her
fortune
spluttered
the
baronet
and
let
me
inform
you
further
that
she
devilish
high
and
haughty
with
it
all
they
do
say
she
even
rebuffed
the
prince
regent
himself
but
then
sir
i
consider
myself
a
better
man
than
the
prince
regent
said
i
sir
richard
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
and
stared
at
me
openmouthed
sir
i
continued
you
doubtless
set
me
down
as
an
egoist
of
egoists
i
freely
confess
it
so
are
you
so
is
grainger
yonder
so
are
we
all
of
us
egoists
in
thinking
ourselves
as
good
as
some
few
of
our
neighbors
and
better
than
a
great
many
deuce
take
me
said
sir
richard
referring
to
the
lady
sophia
i
have
heard
that
she
once
galloped
her
horse
up
the
steps
of
paul
cathedral
and
down
again
peter
added
sir
richard
also
she
is
said
to
be
possessed
of
a
temper
i
continued
and
is
above
the
average
height
i
believe
and
i
have
a
natural
antipathy
to
termagants
more
especially
tall
ones
termagant
cried
sir
richard
why
she
the
handsomest
woman
in
london
boy
she
none
of
your
misses
curse
me
no
she
all
fire
and
blood
and
high
mettle
a
woman
sir
glorious
divine
damme
sir
a
goddess
a
positive
plum
sir
richard
said
i
should
i
ever
contemplate
marriage
which
is
most
improbable
my
wife
must
be
sweet
and
shy
and
soft
of
voice
instead
of
your
bold
creature
above
all
she
must
be
sweet
and
clinging
sweet
and
sticky
oh
the
devil
hark
to
the
boy
grainger
cried
sir
richard
hark
to
him
and
one
glance
of
the
glorious
bright
eyes
one
glance
only
grainger
and
he
be
at
her
feet
on
his
knees
on
his
confounded
knees
sir
the
question
is
how
do
you
propose
to
maintain
yourself
in
the
future
said
grainger
at
this
point
life
under
your
altered
fortunes
must
prove
necessarily
hard
mr
peter
and
yet
sir
i
answered
a
fortune
with
a
wife
tagged
on
to
it
must
prove
a
very
mixed
blessing
after
all
and
then
again
there
may
be
a
certain
amount
of
satisfaction
in
stepping
into
a
dead
man
shoes
but
i
very
foolishly
perhaps
have
a
hankering
for
shoes
of
my
own
surely
there
must
be
some
position
in
life
that
i
am
competent
to
fill
some
position
that
would
maintain
me
honorably
and
well
i
flatter
myself
that
my
years
at
oxford
were
not
altogether
barren
of
result
by
no
means
put
in
sir
richard
you
won
the
high
jump
i
believe
sir
i
did
said
i
also
the
hammer
and
spent
two
thousand
pounds
per
annum
said
sir
richard
sir
i
did
but
between
whiles
managed
to
do
fairly
well
in
the
tripos
to
finish
a
new
and
original
translation
of
quintilian
another
of
petronius
arbiter
and
also
a
literal
rendering
into
the
english
of
the
memoirs
of
the
sieur
de
brantome
for
none
of
which
you
have
hitherto
found
a
publisher
inquired
grainger
not
as
yet
said
i
but
i
have
great
hopes
of
my
brantome
as
you
are
probably
aware
this
is
the
first
time
he
has
ever
been
translated
into
the
english
hum
said
sir
richard
ha
and
in
the
meantime
what
do
you
intend
to
do
on
that
head
i
have
as
yet
come
to
no
definite
conclusion
sir
i
answered
i
have
been
wondering
began
grainger
somewhat
diffidently
if
you
would
care
to
accept
a
position
in
my
office
to
be
sure
the
remuneration
would
be
small
at
first
and
quite
insignificant
in
comparison
to
the
income
you
have
been
in
the
receipt
of
but
it
would
have
been
money
earned
said
i
which
is
infinitely
preferable
to
that
for
which
we
never
turn
a
hand
at
least
i
think
so
then
you
accept
no
sir
said
i
though
i
am
grateful
to
you
and
thank
you
most
sincerely
for
your
offer
yet
i
have
never
felt
the
least
inclination
to
the
practice
of
law
where
there
is
no
interest
one
work
must
necessarily
suffer
and
i
have
no
desire
that
your
business
should
be
injured
by
any
carelessness
of
mine
what
do
you
think
of
a
private
tutorship
it
would
suit
me
above
all
things
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
genus
is
the
most
aggravating
of
all
animals
and
that
i
am
conscious
of
a
certain
shortness
of
temper
at
times
which
might
result
in
pain
to
my
pupil
loss
of
dignity
to
myself
and
general
unpleasantness
to
all
concerned
otherwise
a
private
tutorship
would
suit
most
admirably
here
sir
richard
took
another
pinch
of
snuff
and
sat
frowning
up
at
the
ceiling
while
grainger
began
tying
up
that
document
which
had
so
altered
my
prospects
as
for
me
i
crossed
to
the
window
and
stood
staring
out
at
the
evening
everywhere
were
trees
tinted
by
the
rosy
glow
of
sunset
trees
that
stirred
sleepily
in
the
gentle
wind
and
far
away
i
could
see
that
famous
highway
built
and
paved
for
the
march
of
roman
legions
winding
away
to
where
it
vanished
over
distant
hill
and
pray
said
sir
richard
still
frowning
at
the
ceiling
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
yourself
now
as
i
looked
out
upon
this
fair
evening
i
became
of
a
sudden
possessed
of
an
overmastering
desire
a
great
longing
for
field
and
meadow
and
hedgerow
for
wood
and
coppice
and
shady
stream
for
sequestered
inns
and
wide
heaths
and
ever
the
broad
highway
in
front
thus
i
answered
sir
richard
question
unhesitatingly
and
without
turning
from
the
window
i
shall
go
sir
on
a
walking
tour
through
kent
and
surrey
into
devonshire
and
thence
probably
to
cornwall
and
with
a
miserable
ten
guineas
in
your
pocket
preposterous
absurd
retorted
sir
richard
on
the
contrary
sir
said
i
the
more
i
ponder
the
project
the
more
enamored
of
it
i
become
and
when
your
money
is
all
gone
how
then
i
shall
turn
my
hand
to
some
useful
employment
said
i
digging
for
instance
digging
ejaculated
sir
richard
and
you
a
scholar
and
what
is
more
a
gentleman
my
dear
sir
richard
said
i
that
all
depends
upon
how
you
would
define
a
gentleman
to
me
he
would
appear
of
late
years
to
have
degenerated
into
a
creature
whose
chief
end
in
life
is
to
spend
money
he
has
never
earned
to
reproduce
his
species
with
a
deplorable
frequency
and
promiscuity
habitually
to
drink
more
than
is
good
for
him
and
between
whiles
to
fill
in
his
time
hunting
or
watching
entranced
while
two
men
pound
each
other
unrecognizable
in
the
prize
ring
occasionally
he
has
the
good
taste
to
break
his
neck
in
the
hunting
field
or
get
himself
gloriously
shot
in
a
duel
but
the
generality
live
on
to
a
good
old
age
turn
their
attention
to
matters
political
and
following
the
dictates
of
their
class
damn
reform
with
a
fervor
equalled
only
by
their
rancor
deuce
take
me
ejaculated
sir
richard
feebly
while
grainger
buried
his
face
in
his
to
my
mind
i
ended
the
man
who
sweats
over
a
spade
or
follows
the
tail
of
a
plough
is
far
nobler
and
higher
in
the
scheme
of
things
than
any
of
your
young
driving
his
coach
and
four
to
brighton
to
the
danger
of
all
and
sundry
sir
richard
slowly
got
up
out
of
his
chair
staring
at
me
good
god
he
exclaimed
at
last
the
boy
a
revolutionary
i
smiled
and
shrugged
my
shoulders
but
before
i
could
speak
grainger
interposed
sedate
and
solemn
as
usual
referring
to
your
proposed
tour
peter
when
do
you
expect
to
start
early
morning
sir
i
will
not
attempt
to
dissuade
you
well
knowing
the
difficulty
said
he
with
a
faint
smile
but
a
letter
addressed
to
me
at
lincoln
inn
will
always
find
me
and
receive
my
most
earnest
attention
so
saying
he
rose
bowed
and
having
shaken
my
hand
left
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
peter
exclaimed
the
baronet
striding
up
and
down
peter
you
are
a
fool
sir
a
pragmatical
young
fool
sir
curse
me
i
am
sorry
you
should
think
so
i
answered
and
he
continued
regarding
me
with
a
defiant
eye
i
shall
expect
you
to
draw
upon
me
for
any
sum
that
that
you
may
require
for
the
present
friendship
sake
boyhood
and
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
er
oh
damme
you
understand
peter
sir
richard
said
i
grasping
his
unwilling
hand
i
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
pooh
peter
dammit
said
he
snatching
his
hand
away
and
thrusting
it
hurriedly
into
his
pocket
out
of
farther
reach
thank
you
sir
i
reiterated
be
sure
that
should
i
fall
ill
or
any
unforeseen
calamity
happen
to
me
i
will
most
gladly
most
gratefully
accept
your
generous
aid
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
is
offered
but
but
exclaimed
sir
richard
until
then
oh
the
devil
said
sir
richard
and
ringing
the
bell
ordered
his
horse
to
be
brought
to
the
door
and
thereafter
stood
with
his
back
to
the
empty
fireplace
his
fists
thrust
down
into
his
pockets
frowning
heavily
and
with
a
fixed
intentness
at
the
nearest
armchair
sir
richard
anstruther
is
tall
and
broad
ruddy
of
face
with
a
prominent
nose
and
great
square
chin
whose
grimness
is
offset
by
a
mouth
singularly
sweet
and
tender
and
the
kindly
light
of
blue
eyes
he
is
in
very
truth
a
gentleman
indeed
as
he
stood
there
in
his
plain
blue
coat
with
its
high
roll
collar
and
shining
silver
buttons
his
spotless
moleskins
and
heavy
riding
boots
he
was
as
fair
a
type
as
might
be
of
the
english
country
gentleman
it
is
such
men
as
he
who
fearless
upon
the
littered
quarterdecks
of
reeling
battleships
undismayed
amid
the
smoke
and
death
of
stricken
fields
their
duty
well
and
nobly
done
have
turned
their
feet
homewards
to
pass
their
latter
days
amid
their
turnips
and
cabbages
beating
their
swords
into
and
glad
enough
to
do
it
peter
said
he
suddenly
sir
said
i
you
never
saw
your
father
to
remember
did
you
no
sir
richard
nor
your
mother
nor
my
mother
poor
boy
poor
boy
you
knew
my
mother
yes
peter
i
knew
your
mother
said
sir
richard
staring
very
hard
at
the
chair
again
and
i
saw
that
his
mouth
had
grown
wonderfully
tender
yours
has
been
a
very
secluded
life
hitherto
peter
he
went
on
after
a
moment
entirely
so
said
i
with
the
exception
of
my
visits
to
the
hall
ah
yes
i
taught
you
to
ride
remember
you
are
associated
with
every
boyish
pleasure
i
ever
knew
said
i
laying
my
hand
upon
his
arm
sir
richard
coughed
and
grew
suddenly
red
in
the
face
why
ah
you
see
peter
he
began
picking
up
his
riding
whip
and
staring
at
it
you
see
your
uncle
was
never
very
fond
of
company
at
any
time
whereas
i
whereas
you
could
always
find
time
to
remember
the
lonely
boy
left
when
all
his
companions
were
gone
on
their
holidays
left
to
his
books
and
the
dreary
desolation
of
the
empty
schoolhouse
and
echoing
cloisters
pooh
exclaimed
sir
richard
redder
than
ever
bosh
do
you
think
i
can
ever
forget
the
glorious
day
when
you
drove
over
in
your
coach
and
four
and
carried
me
off
in
triumph
and
how
we
raced
the
fellow
in
the
tilbury
and
beat
him
added
sir
richard
took
off
his
near
wheel
on
the
turn
said
i
the
fool
own
fault
said
sir
richard
and
left
him
in
the
ditch
cursing
us
said
i
egad
yes
peter
oh
but
those
were
fine
horses
and
though
i
say
it
no
better
team
in
the
south
country
you
remember
the
broke
his
leg
shortly
after
and
had
to
be
shot
poor
devil
and
later
at
oxford
i
began
what
now
peter
said
sir
richard
frowning
darkly
do
you
remember
the
bronze
vase
that
used
to
stand
on
the
mantelpiece
in
my
study
bronze
vase
repeated
sir
richard
intent
upon
his
whip
again
i
used
to
find
in
it
after
you
had
visited
me
and
when
i
hid
the
vase
they
turned
up
just
the
same
in
most
unexpected
places
young
fellow
must
have
money
necessary
now
and
then
muttered
sir
richard
at
this
juncture
with
a
discreet
knock
the
butler
appeared
to
announce
that
sir
richard
horse
was
waiting
hereupon
the
baronet
somewhat
hastily
caught
up
his
hat
and
gloves
and
i
followed
him
out
of
the
house
and
down
the
steps
sir
richard
drew
on
his
gloves
thrust
his
toe
into
the
stirrup
and
then
turned
to
look
at
me
over
his
arm
peter
said
he
sir
richard
said
i
regarding
your
walking
tour
yes
i
think
it
all
damned
tomfoolery
said
sir
richard
after
saying
which
he
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
with
a
lightness
and
ease
that
many
younger
might
have
envied
i
sorry
for
that
sir
because
my
mind
is
set
upon
it
with
ten
guineas
in
your
pocket
that
with
due
economy
should
be
ample
until
i
can
find
some
means
to
earn
more
a
fiddlestick
sir
an
accursed
fiddlestick
snorted
sir
richard
how
is
a
boy
an
unsophisticated
young
fool
of
a
boy
to
earn
his
own
living
others
have
done
it
i
began
pish
said
the
baronet
and
been
the
better
for
it
in
the
end
tush
said
the
baronet
and
i
have
a
great
desire
to
see
the
world
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
multitude
bah
said
the
baronet
so
forcibly
that
his
mare
started
this
comes
of
your
damnable
revolutionary
tendencies
let
me
tell
you
want
is
a
hard
master
and
the
world
a
bad
place
for
one
who
is
moneyless
and
without
friends
you
forget
sir
i
shall
never
be
without
a
friend
god
knows
it
boy
answered
sir
richard
and
his
hand
fell
and
rested
for
a
moment
upon
my
shoulder
peter
said
he
very
slowly
and
heavily
i
growing
old
and
i
shall
never
marry
and
sometimes
peter
of
an
evening
i
get
very
lonely
and
lonely
peter
he
stopped
for
a
while
gazing
away
towards
the
green
slopes
of
distant
hill
oh
boy
said
he
at
last
wo
you
come
to
the
hall
and
help
me
to
spend
my
money
without
answering
i
reached
up
and
clasped
his
hand
it
was
the
hand
which
held
his
whip
and
i
noticed
how
tightly
he
gripped
the
handle
and
wondered
sir
richard
said
i
at
last
wherever
i
go
i
shall
treasure
the
recollection
of
this
moment
but
but
peter
but
sir
oh
dammit
he
exclaimed
and
set
spurs
to
his
mare
yet
once
he
turned
in
his
saddle
to
flourish
his
whip
to
me
ere
he
galloped
out
of
sight
chapter
ii
i
set
out
the
clock
of
the
norman
church
a
mile
away
was
striking
the
hour
of
four
as
i
let
myself
out
into
the
morning
it
was
dark
as
yet
and
chilly
but
in
the
east
was
already
a
faint
glimmer
of
dawn
reaching
the
stables
i
paused
with
my
hand
on
the
listening
to
the
hiss
hissing
that
told
me
adam
the
groom
was
already
at
work
within
as
i
entered
he
looked
up
from
the
saddle
he
was
polishing
and
touched
his
forehead
with
a
grimy
forefinger
you
be
early
abroad
mr
peter
yes
said
i
i
wish
to
be
on
shooter
hill
at
sunrise
but
first
i
came
to
say
to
to
be
sure
sir
nodded
adam
picking
up
his
lanthorn
upon
the
ensuing
interview
i
will
not
dwell
it
was
affecting
both
to
her
and
to
myself
for
we
were
mutually
attached
sir
said
adam
when
at
last
the
stable
door
had
closed
behind
us
that
there
mare
knows
as
you
her
i
think
she
does
adam
be
wonderful
wise
sir
yes
adam
this
is
a
bad
day
for
wings
sir
and
all
of
us
for
that
matter
i
hope
not
adam
you
be
away
they
tell
me
sir
yes
going
away
i
nodded
wonder
what
become
o
the
mare
sir
ah
yes
i
wonder
said
i
everything
to
be
sold
under
the
will
i
think
sir
everything
adam
excuse
me
sir
said
he
knuckling
his
forehead
you
wo
be
wanting
ever
a
groom
will
you
no
adam
i
answered
shaking
my
head
i
be
wanting
a
groom
nor
yet
a
body
servant
sir
no
adam
nor
yet
a
body
servant
here
there
ensued
a
silence
during
which
adam
knuckled
his
right
temple
again
and
i
tightened
the
buckle
of
my
knapsack
i
think
adam
said
i
i
think
it
is
going
to
be
a
fine
day
yes
sir
adam
said
i
and
held
out
my
hand
sir
and
having
shaken
my
hand
he
turned
and
went
back
into
the
stable
so
i
set
off
walking
beneath
an
avenue
of
trees
looming
up
gigantic
on
either
hand
at
the
end
was
the
lodge
and
ere
i
opened
the
gates
for
john
the
lodgekeeper
was
not
yet
astir
ere
i
opened
the
gates
i
say
i
paused
for
one
last
look
at
the
house
that
had
been
all
the
home
i
had
ever
known
since
i
could
remember
as
i
stood
thus
with
my
eyes
upon
the
indistinct
mass
i
presently
distinguished
a
figure
running
towards
me
and
as
he
came
up
recognized
adam
it
ai
much
sir
but
it
all
i
said
he
and
thrust
a
short
thick
clay
pipe
into
my
hand
a
pipe
that
was
fashioned
to
the
shape
of
a
negro
head
it
a
good
pipe
sir
he
went
on
a
mortal
good
pipe
and
as
sweet
as
a
nut
saying
which
he
turned
about
and
ran
off
leaving
me
standing
there
with
his
parting
gift
in
my
hand
and
having
put
the
pipe
into
an
inner
pocket
i
opened
the
gate
and
started
off
at
a
good
pace
along
the
broad
highway
it
was
a
bleak
desolate
world
that
lay
about
me
a
world
of
shadows
and
a
white
mist
that
filled
every
hollow
and
swathed
hedge
and
tree
a
lowering
earth
and
a
frowning
heaven
infinitely
depressing
but
the
eastern
sky
was
clear
with
an
brightness
hope
lay
there
so
as
i
walked
i
kept
my
eyes
towards
the
east
being
come
at
last
to
that
eminence
which
is
called
shooter
hill
i
sat
down
upon
a
bank
beside
the
way
and
turned
to
look
back
upon
the
wonderful
city
and
as
i
watched
the
pearly
east
changed
little
by
little
to
a
varying
pink
which
in
turn
slowly
gave
place
to
reds
and
yellows
until
up
came
the
sun
in
all
his
majesty
gilding
vane
and
weathercock
upon
a
hundred
spires
and
steeples
and
making
a
glory
of
the
river
far
away
upon
the
white
riband
of
road
that
led
across
blackheath
a
chaise
was
crawling
but
save
for
that
the
world
seemed
deserted
i
sat
thus
a
great
while
gazing
upon
the
city
and
marvelling
at
the
greatness
of
it
truly
said
i
to
myself
nowhere
in
the
whole
world
is
there
such
another
city
as
london
and
presently
i
sighed
and
rising
set
my
back
to
the
city
and
went
on
down
the
hill
yes
the
sun
was
up
at
last
and
at
his
advent
the
mists
rolled
up
and
vanished
the
birds
awoke
in
brake
and
thicket
and
lifting
their
voices
sang
together
a
song
of
universal
praise
bushes
rustled
trees
whispered
while
from
every
leaf
and
twig
from
every
blade
of
grass
there
hung
a
flashing
jewel
with
the
mists
my
doubts
of
the
future
vanished
too
and
i
strode
upon
my
way
a
very
god
king
of
my
destiny
walking
through
a
tribute
world
where
feathered
songsters
carolled
for
me
and
blossoming
flowers
wafted
sweet
perfume
upon
my
path
so
i
went
on
gayly
down
the
hill
rejoicing
that
i
was
alive
in
the
knapsack
at
my
back
i
had
stowed
a
few
clothes
the
strongest
and
plainest
i
possessed
together
with
a
shirt
some
favorite
books
and
my
translation
of
brantome
quintilian
and
petronius
i
had
left
with
grainger
who
had
promised
to
send
them
to
a
publisher
a
friend
of
his
and
in
my
pocket
was
my
uncle
legacy
namely
ten
guineas
in
gold
and
as
i
walked
i
began
to
compute
how
long
such
a
sum
might
be
made
to
last
a
man
by
practising
the
strictest
economy
i
thought
i
might
manage
well
enough
on
two
shillings
a
day
and
this
left
me
some
hundred
odd
days
in
which
to
find
some
means
of
livelihood
and
if
a
man
could
not
suit
himself
in
such
time
then
thought
i
he
must
be
a
fool
indeed
thus
my
thoughts
caught
something
of
the
glory
of
the
bright
sky
above
and
the
smiling
earth
about
me
as
i
strode
along
that
broad
highway
which
was
to
lead
me
i
knew
not
whither
yet
where
disaster
was
already
lying
in
wait
for
me
as
you
shall
hear
chapter
iii
concerns
itself
mainly
with
a
hat
as
the
day
advanced
the
sun
beat
down
with
an
heat
and
what
with
this
and
the
dust
i
presently
grew
very
thirsty
wherefore
as
i
went
i
must
needs
conjure
up
tantalizing
visions
of
ale
of
ale
that
foamed
gloriously
in
tankards
that
sparkled
in
glasses
and
gurgled
deliciously
from
the
spouts
of
earthen
pitchers
and
i
began
to
look
about
me
for
some
inn
where
these
visions
might
be
realized
and
my
burning
thirst
nobly
quenched
as
such
a
thirst
deserved
to
be
on
i
went
through
this
beautiful
land
of
kent
past
tree
and
hedge
and
smiling
meadow
by
hill
and
dale
and
sloping
upland
while
ever
the
sun
grew
hotter
the
winding
road
the
dustier
and
my
mighty
thirst
the
mightier
at
length
reaching
the
brow
of
a
hill
i
espied
a
small
inn
or
hedge
tavern
that
stood
back
from
the
glare
of
the
road
seeming
to
nestle
in
the
shade
of
a
great
tree
and
joyfully
i
hastened
toward
it
as
i
approached
i
heard
loud
voices
raised
as
though
in
altercation
and
a
hat
came
hurtling
through
the
open
doorway
and
bounding
into
the
road
rolled
over
and
over
to
my
very
feet
and
looking
down
at
it
i
saw
that
it
was
a
very
hat
frayed
and
worn
dented
of
crown
and
broken
of
brim
yet
beneath
its
sordid
shabbiness
there
lurked
the
dim
semblance
of
what
it
had
once
been
for
in
the
scratched
and
tarnished
buckle
in
the
jaunty
curl
of
the
brim
it
still
preserved
a
certain
pitiful
air
of
rakishness
wherefore
i
stooped
and
picking
it
up
began
to
brush
the
dust
from
it
as
well
as
i
might
i
was
thus
engaged
when
there
arose
a
sudden
roar
and
glancing
up
i
beheld
a
man
who
reeled
backwards
out
of
the
inn
and
who
after
staggering
a
yard
or
so
thudded
down
into
the
road
and
so
lay
staring
vacantly
up
at
the
sky
before
i
could
reach
him
however
he
got
upon
his
legs
and
crossing
unsteadily
to
the
tree
i
have
mentioned
leaned
there
and
i
saw
there
was
much
blood
upon
his
face
which
he
essayed
to
wipe
away
with
the
cuff
of
his
coat
now
upon
his
whole
person
from
the
crown
of
his
unkempt
head
down
to
his
broken
dusty
boots
there
yet
clung
that
air
of
jaunty
rakishness
which
i
had
seen
and
pitied
in
his
hat
observing
as
i
came
up
how
heavily
he
leaned
against
the
tree
and
noting
the
extreme
pallor
of
his
face
and
the
blank
gaze
of
his
sunken
eyes
i
touched
him
upon
the
shoulder
sir
i
trust
you
are
not
hurt
said
i
thank
you
he
answered
his
glance
still
wandering
not
in
the
least
assure
you
merely
tap
on
the
nose
sir
unpleasant
damnably
but
no
more
no
more
i
think
said
i
holding
out
the
battered
hat
i
think
this
is
yours
his
eye
encountering
it
in
due
time
he
reached
out
his
hand
somewhat
fumblingly
and
took
it
from
me
with
a
slight
movement
of
the
head
and
shoulders
that
might
have
been
a
bow
thank
you
yes
should
know
it
among
a
thousand
said
he
dreamily
an
old
friend
and
a
tried
a
very
much
tried
one
many
thanks
with
which
words
he
clapped
the
friend
upon
his
head
and
with
another
movement
that
might
have
been
a
bow
turned
short
round
and
strode
away
and
as
he
went
despite
the
careless
swing
of
his
shoulder
his
legs
seemed
to
falter
somewhat
in
their
stride
and
once
i
thought
he
staggered
yet
as
i
watched
half
minded
to
follow
after
him
he
settled
his
hat
more
firmly
with
a
light
tap
upon
the
crown
and
thrusting
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
threadbare
coat
fell
to
whistling
lustily
and
so
turning
a
bend
in
the
road
vanished
from
my
sight
and
presently
my
thirst
recurring
to
me
i
approached
the
inn
and
descending
three
steps
entered
its
cool
shade
here
i
found
four
men
each
with
his
pipe
and
tankard
to
whom
a
large
fellow
was
holding
forth
in
a
high
state
of
heat
and
indignation
wot
england
to
that
wot
i
wants
to
know
he
was
saying
wot
england
to
when
thievin
robbers
can
come
in
on
you

pint
o
your
best
ale
out
o
your
very
own
tankard
under
your
very
own
nose
wot

to
ah
nodded
the
others
solemnly
that
it
joel
wot
growled
the
innkeeper
bringing
his
big
fist
down
with
a
bang
it
to
per
dition
that
wot
it
to
and
wot
inquired
a
rather
long
bony
man
with
a
face
in
sandy
whisker
wot
might
per
dition
be
joel
likewise
wheer
you
must
be
a
danged
fule
tom
my
lad
retorted
he
whom
they
called
joel
redder
in
the
face
than
ever
ay
that
ye
must
chorused
the
others
i
only
axed
an
wheer

repeated
joel
scornfully
ah
nodded
the
other
that
all
but
you
always
you
are
said
joel
gloomily
i
notice
retorted
the
man
tom
blowing
into
his
tankard
i
notice
as
you
ai
never
o
answerin
oh
i
ai
ai
i
no
you
ai
repeated
tom
nohow
here
the
man
grew
so
very
red
indeed
that
the
others
fell
to
coughing
all
together
and
shuffling
their
feet
and
giving
divers
other
evidences
of
their
embarrassment
all
save
the
unimpressionable
tom
seizing
the
occasion
that
now
presented
itself
i
knocked
loudly
upon
the
floor
with
my
stick
whereupon
the
man
removing
his
eyes
slowly
and
by
degrees
from
the
unconcerned
tom
fixed
them
darkly
upon
me
supposing
said
i
supposing
you
are
so
very
obliging
as
to
serve
me
with
a
pint
of
ale
then
supposin
you
show
me
the
color
o
your
money
he
growled
come
money
fust
i
are
takin
no
more
risks
for
answer
i
laid
the
coins
before
him
and
having
pocketed
the
money
he
filled
and
thrust
a
foaming
tankard
towards
me
which
i
emptied
forthwith
and
called
upon
him
for
another
wheer
your
money
here
said
i
tossing
a
sixpence
to
him
and
you
can
keep
the
change
why
ye
see
sir
he
began
somewhat
mollified
it
be
precious
to
know
who
a
gentleman
an
who
ai
who
a
thief
an
who
these
days
how
so
why
only
a
little
while
ago
just
afore
you
chap
comes
in
no
account
much
to
look
at
but
very
for
all
that
comes
in
do
an
calls
for
a
pint
o
ale
you
all
on
ye
he
broke
off
turning
to
the
others
you
all
call
for
a
pint
o
ale
ah
we
they
nodded
comes
in
do
bold
as
brass
calls
for
a
pint
ale
drinks
it
off
an
me
you
all
seen
me
he
inquired
once
more
addressing
the
others
every
man
of
us
the
four
chimed
in
with
four
individual
nods
this
says
i
turnin
it
over
a
or
once
was
says
i
do
want
it
says
i
you
got
it
you
better
keep

for
says
i
says
only

seein
i
got
your
ale

a
case
of
exchange
says
is
it
says
i
an
pitched
the
thing
out
into
the
road
an
arter
it
an
so
it
ended
an
wot
said
the
man
nodding
his
big
head
at
me
wot
d
think
o
that
now
why
i
think
you
were
perhaps
a
trifle
hasty
said
i
oh
ye
do
do
ye
yes
i
nodded
an
for
why
well
you
will
probably
remember
that
the
hat
had
a
band
round
it
ay
all
wore
away
it
were
too
and
that
in
the
band
was
a
buckle
ay
all
scratched
an
rusty
it
were
well
well
that
tarnished
buckle
was
of
silver
silver
gasped
the
man
his
jaw
falling
and
easily
worth
five
shillings
perhaps
more
so
that
i
think
you
were
upon
the
whole
rather
hasty
saying
which
i
finished
my
ale
and
taking
up
my
staff
stepped
out
into
the
sunshine
chapter
iv
i
meet
with
a
great
misfortune
that
day
i
passed
through
several
villages
stopping
only
to
eat
and
drink
thus
evening
was
falling
as
having
left
fair
sevenoaks
behind
i
came
to
the
brow
of
a
certain
hill
a
long
and
very
steep
descent
which
i
think
is
called
the
river
hill
and
here
rising
stark
against
the
evening
sky
was
a
gibbet
and
standing
beneath
it
a
man
a
short
square
man
in
a
somewhat
shabby
coat
of
a
and
with
a
beaver
hat
sloped
down
over
his
eyes
who
stood
with
his
feet
well
apart
sucking
the
knob
of
a
stick
he
carried
while
he
stared
up
at
that
which
dangled
by
a
stout
chain
from
the
of
the
gibbet
something
black
and
shrivelled
and
horrible
that
had
once
been
human
as
i
came
up
the
man
drew
the
stick
from
his
mouth
and
touched
the
brim
of
his
hat
with
it
in
salutation
an
object
lesson
sir
said
he
and
nodded
towards
the
loathsome
mass
above
a
very
hideous
one
said
i
pausing
and
i
think
a
very
useless
one
he
was
as
fine
a
fellow
as
ever
thrust
toe
into
stirrup
the
man
went
on
pointing
upwards
with
his
stick
though
you
never
think
so
to
look
at
him
now
it
a
horrible
sight
said
i
it
is
nodded
the
man
it
a
sight
to
turn
a
man
stomach
that
it
is
you
knew
him
perhaps
said
i
knew
him
repeated
the
man
staring
at
me
over
his
shoulder
knew
him
ah
that
is
i
knew
of
him
a
highwayman
nick
scrope
his
name
was
answered
the
man
with
a
nod
hung
at
maidstone
assizes
last
year
and
a
very
good
end
he
made
of
it
too
and
here
he
be
hung
up
in
chains
all
and
as
a
warning
to
all
and
sundry
the
more
shame
to
england
said
i
to
my
thinking
it
is
a
scandal
that
our
highways
should
be
rendered
odious
by
such
horrors
and
as
wicked
as
it
is
useless
rot
me
cried
the
fellow
slapping
a
cloud
of
dust
from
his
coat
with
his
stick
hark
to
that
now
what
said
i
do
you
think
for
one
moment
that
such
a
sight
horrible
though
it
is
could
possibly
deter
a
man
from
robbery
or
murder
whose
mind
is
already
made
up
to
it
by
reason
of
circumstances
or
starvation
well
but
it
an
old
custom
as
old
as
this
here
road
true
said
i
and
that
of
itself
but
proves
my
argument
for
men
have
been
hanged
and
gibbeted
all
these
years
yet
robbery
and
murder
abide
with
us
still
and
are
of
daily
occurrence
why
as
to
that
sir
said
the
man
falling
into
step
beside
me
as
i
walked
on
down
the
hill
i
wo
say
yes
and
i
wo
say
no
but
what
i
do
say
is
as
many
a
man
might
think
twice
afore
running
the
chance
of
coming
to
that
look
and
he
stopped
to
turn
and
point
back
at
the
gibbet
with
his
stick
nick
ca
last
much
longer
though
know
hang
a
good
time
but
they
made
a
botch
of
nick
not
enough
tar
you
can
see
where
the
sun
catches
him
there
once
more
though
my
whole
being
revolted
at
the
sight
i
must
needs
turn
to
look
at
the
thing
the
tall
black
shaft
of
the
gibbet
and
the
grisly
horror
that
dangled
beneath
with
its
chains
and
iron
bands
and
from
this
back
again
to
my
companion
to
find
him
regarding
me
with
a
curiously
twisted
smile
and
a
pistol
held
within
a
foot
of
my
head
well
said
i
staring
sir
said
he
tapping
his
boot
with
his
stick
i
must
trouble
you
for
the
shiner
i
see
at
me
from
your
cravat
likewise
your
watch
and
any
small
change
you
may
have
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
glancing
from
his
grinning
mouth
swiftly
over
the
deserted
road
and
back
again
likewise
said
the
fellow
i
must
ask
you
to
be
sharp
about
it
it
was
with
singularly
clumsy
fingers
that
i
drew
the
watch
from
my
fob
and
the
pin
from
my
cravat
and
passed
them
to
him
now
your
pockets
he
suggested
turn
out
this
command
i
reluctantly
obeyed
bringing
to
light
my
ten
guineas
which
were
as
yet
intact
and
which
he
pocketed
forthwith
and
two
pennies
which
he
bade
me
keep
for
said
he
will
buy
you
a
draught
of
ale
sir
and
good
stuff
to
be
had
at
white
hart
yonder
and
there
like
a
draught
of
good
ale
to
comfort
a
man
in
any
such
small
adversity
like
this
here
as
to
that
knapsack
now
he
pursued
eyeing
it
thoughtfully
it
looks
heavy
and
might
hold
valleybels
but
then
on
the
other
hand
it
might
not
and
those
there
straps
takes
time
to
unbuckle
and
he
broke
off
suddenly
for
from
somewhere
on
the
hill
below
us
came
the
unmistakable
sound
of
wheels
hereupon
the
fellow
very
nimbly
ran
across
the
road
turned
nodded
and
vanished
among
the
trees
and
underbrush
that
clothed
the
steep
slope
down
to
the
valley
below
chapter
v
the
bagman
i
was
yet
standing
there
half
stunned
by
my
loss
and
the
suddenness
of
it
all
when
a
tilbury
came
slowly
round
a
bend
in
the
road
the
driver
of
which
nodded
lazily
in
his
seat
while
his
horse
a
sorry
jaded
animal
plodded
wearily
up
the
steep
slope
of
the
hill
as
he
approached
i
hailed
him
loudly
upon
which
he
suddenly
dived
down
between
his
knees
and
produced
a
blunderbuss
what
to
do
cried
he
a
fellow
what
to
do
eh
and
he
covered
me
with
the
wide
mouth
of
the
blunderbuss
thieves
said
i
i
been
robbed
and
not
three
minutes
since
ah
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
great
relief
and
with
the
color
returning
to
his
plump
cheeks
is
that
the
way
of
it
it
is
said
i
and
a
very
bad
way

fellow

left
me

minutes

the
fellow
staring

money

the
fellow

said
i
cutting
him
short
but
my
mare
what
about
my
mare
she
stand
i
answered
she
tired
enough
the
bagman
for
such
i
took
him
to
be
sighed
and
blunderbuss
in
hand
prepared
to
alight
but
in
the
act
of
doing
so
paused
was
the
rascal
armed
he
inquired
over
his
shoulder
to
be
sure
he
was
said
i
the
bagman
got
back
into
his
seat
and
took
up
the
reins
what
now
i
inquired
it
this
accursed
mare
of
mine
he
answered
she
bolt
again
d
see
twice
yesterday
and
once
the
day
before
she
bolted
sir
and
on
a
road
like
this
then
lend
me
your
blunderbuss
i
ca
do
that
he
replied
shaking
his
head
but
why
not
said
i
impatiently
because
this
is
a
dangerous
road
and
i
do
intend
to
be
left
unarmed
on
a
dangerous
road
i
never
have
been
and
i
never
will
and
there
an
end
of
it
d
see
then
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
refuse
your
aid
to
a
that
you
will
sit
there
and
let
the
rogue
get
away
with
all
the
money
i
possess
in
the
world
oh
no
not
on
no
account
just
you
get
up
here
beside
me
and
drive
to
white
hart
i
well
known
at
white
hart
get
a
few
honest
fellows
at
our
heels
and
have
this
thieving
rascally
villain
in
the
twinkling
of
an
he
stopped
suddenly
made
a
frantic
clutch
at
his
blunderbuss
and
sat
staring
turning
short
round
i
saw
the
man
in
the
beaver
hat
standing
within
a
yard
of
us
fingering
his
long
pistol
and
with
the
same
twisted
smile
upon
his
lips
i
a
mind
said
he
nodding
his
head
at
the
bagman
i
a
great
mind
to
blow
your
face
off
the
blunderbuss
fell
to
the
roadway
with
a
clatter
thievin
rascally
villain
was
it
damme
i
think
i
will
blow
your
face
off
no
do
do
that
said
the
bagman
in
a
strange
jerky
voice
what
be
the
good
why
that
there
poor
animal
would
have
to
drag
that
fat
carkiss
of
yours
up
and
down
hills
for
one
thing
i
get
out
and
walk
and
it
might
learn
ye
to
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
i
i
did
mean
any
offence
then
chuck
us
your
purse
growled
the
other
and
be
quick
about
it
the
bagman
obeyed
with
wonderful
celerity
and
i
heard
the
purse
chink
as
the
footpad
dropped
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
greatcoat
as
for
you
said
he
turning
to
me
you
get
on
your
way
and
never
mind
me
forget
you
ever
had
ten
guineas
and
do
go
your
vallyble
young
life
come
up
with
you
and
he
motioned
me
into
the
tilbury
with
his
pistol
what
about
my
blunderbuss
expostulated
the
bagman
faintly
as
i
seated
myself
beside
him
you
give
me
my
blunderbuss
cost
me
five
pound
it
did
more
fool
you
said
the
highwayman
and
picking
up
the
unwieldy
weapon
he
hove
it
into
the
ditch
as
to
our
argyment
regardin
gibbetin
sir
said
he
nodding
to
me
i
rayther
inclined
to
think
you
was
in
the
right
on
it
arter
all
then
turning
towards
the
bagman
drive
on
said
he
and
sharp
the
word
whereupon
the
bagman
whipped
up
his
horse
and
as
the
tired
animal
struggled
forward
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
i
saw
the
highwayman
still
watching
us
very
soon
we
came
in
view
of
the
white
hart
an
inn
i
remembered
to
have
passed
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
road
and
scarce
were
we
driven
up
to
the
door
than
down
jumped
the
bagman
leaving
me
to
follow
at
my
leisure
and
running
into
the
tap
forthwith
began
recounting
his
loss
to
all
and
sundry
so
that
i
soon
found
we
were
become
the
center
of
a
gaping
crowd
much
to
my
disgust
indeed
i
would
have
slipped
away
but
each
time
i
attempted
to
do
so
the
bagman
would
appeal
to
me
to
corroborate
some
statement
galloping
dick
himself
or
i
a
dutchman
he
cried
for
the
twentieth
time
up
he
comes
bold
as
brass
bless
you
and
a
in
each
hand
hard
says
i
and
ups
with
my
blunderbuss
you
remember
as
i
ups
with
my
blunderbuss
he
inquired
turning
to
me
quite
well
said
i
ah
but
you
should
have
seen
the
fellow
face
when
he
saw
my
blunderbuss
ready
at
my
shoulder
green
it
was
green
as
grass
for
if
ever
there
was
death
in
a
man
face
and
sudden
death
at
that
there
was
sudden
death
in
mine
when
all
at
once
my
mare
my
accursed
mare
jibbed
yes
yes
cried
breathless
voices
what
then
why
then
gentlemen
said
the
bagman
shaking
his
head
and
frowning
round
upon
the
ring
of
intent
faces
why
then
gentlemen
being
a
resolute
determined
fellow
i
did
what
any
other
man
of
spirit
would
have
done
i
dropped
your
blunderbuss
said
i
ay
to
be
sure
i
did
and
he
pitched
it
into
the
ditch
said
i
ay
nodded
the
bagman
dubiously
while
the
others
crowded
nearer
and
then
he
took
your
money
and
called
you
and
and
so
it
ended
said
i
with
which
i
pushed
my
way
from
the
circle
and
finding
a
quiet
corner
beside
the
chimney
sat
down
and
with
my
last
twopence
paid
for
a
tankard
of
ale
chapter
vi
what
befell
me
at
the
white
hart
when
a
man
has
experienced
some
great
and
totally
unexpected
reverse
of
fortune
has
been
swept
from
one
plane
of
existence
to
another
that
he
should
fail
at
once
to
recognize
the
full
magnitude
of
that
change
is
but
natural
for
his
faculties
must
of
necessity
be
numbed
more
or
less
by
its
very
suddenness
yesterday
i
had
been
reduced
from
affluence
to
poverty
with
an
unexpectedness
that
had
dazed
me
for
the
time
being
and
from
the
poverty
of
an
hour
ago
i
now
found
myself
reduced
to
an
utter
destitution
without
the
wherewithal
to
pay
for
the
meanest
lodging
and
contrasting
the
careless
ease
of
a
few
days
since
with
my
present
lamentable
situation
i
fell
into
a
gloomy
meditation
and
the
longer
i
thought
it
over
the
more
dejected
i
became
to
be
sure
i
might
apply
to
sir
richard
for
assistance
but
my
pride
revolted
at
even
the
thought
more
especially
at
such
an
early
stage
moreover
i
had
determined
beforehand
to
walk
my
appointed
road
unaided
from
the
first
from
these
depressing
thoughts
i
was
presently
aroused
by
a
loud
rough
voice
at
no
great
distance
to
which
though
i
had
been
dimly
conscious
of
it
for
some
time
i
had
before
paid
no
attention
now
however
i
raised
my
eyes
from
the
spot
upon
the
floor
where
they
had
rested
hitherto
and
fixed
them
upon
the
speaker
he
was
a
fellow
evidently
held
in
much
respect
by
his
companions
for
he
occupied
the
head
of
the
table
and
i
noticed
that
when
ever
he
spoke
the
others
held
their
peace
and
hung
upon
the
words
with
an
appearance
of
much
respect
sirs
says
i
he
began
louder
than
before
and
with
a
flourish
of
his
pipe
sirs

my
lord
says
i
gathering
up
the
rhino
by
name
craggy
by
natur
my
lord
says
i
hereupon
ensued
a
roar
of
laughter
with
much
slapping
of
thighs
and
stamping
of
feet
while
the
man
solemnly
emptied
his
tankard
which
was
the
signal
for
two
or
three
of
those
nearest
to
vie
for
its
possession
during
which
tom
cragg
sucked
dreamily
at
his
pipe
and
stared
placidly
up
at
the
ceiling
now
tom
said
a
tall
bony
individual
chiefly
remarkable
in
possessing
but
one
eye
and
that
so
extremely
pale
and
watery
as
to
give
one
the
idea
that
it
was
very
much
overworked
now
tom
said
he
setting
down
the
refilled
tankard
at
the
great
man
elbow
with
a
triumphant
flourish
tell
us
you
shook
wi
the
prince
regent
ah
tell

chimed
the
rest
well
said
the
man
stooping
to
blow
the
froth
from
his
ale
it
was
arter
i
beat
jack
nolan
of
brummagem
the
prince
come
to

i

a
loose

an
slapped
me
on
the
back
did
merry
own
an
likewise
gave
me
this
pin
saying
which
he
pointed
to
a
flaming
diamond
horseshoe
which
he
wore
stuck
through
his
neckerchief
the
stones
were
extremely
large
and
handsome
looking
very
much
out
of
place
on
the
fellow
rough
person
and
seemed
in
some
part
to
bear
out
his
story
though
indeed
as
regarded
his
association
with
the
prince
regent
whose
tastes
were
at
all
times
peculiar
to
say
the
least
and
whose
love
for
the
fancy
was
notorious
i
thought
it
on
the
whole
very
probable
for
despite
craggy
words
foolishly
blatant
though
they
sounded
there
was
about
him
in
his
low
retreating
brow
his
small
eyes
his
great
square
jowl
and
heavy
chin
a
certain
air
there
was
no
mistaking
i
also
noticed
that
the
upper
half
of
one
ear
was
unduly
thick
and
swollen
which
is
a
mark
i
believe
of
the
professional
pugilist
alone
tom
cried
the
man
wot

this

i
should
answer
you
sir

ten
rounds
to
do
it
not

as
may
be
expected
at
this
mention
of
my
cousin
name
i
pricked
up
my
ears
and
what
all
this
him
out
tom
cragg
in
three
at
this
there
was
a
sudden
silence
and
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
speaker
a
small
fellow
with
a
truculent
eye
come
said
he
blowing
out
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
in
three
rounds
what
d
say
to
that
now
come
cragg
had
started
up
in
his
chair
and
now
sat
scowling
at
his
inquisitor
and
in
the
hush
i
could
hear
the
ticking
of
the
clock
in
the
corner
and
the
crackle
of
the
logs
upon
the
hearth
then
all
at
once
cragg
pipe
shivered
to
fragments
on
the
floor
and
he
leapt
to
his
feet
in
one
stride
as
it
seemed
he
reached
the
speaker
who
occupied
the
corner
opposite
mine
but
even
as
he
raised
his
fist
he
checked
himself
before
the
which
the
other
held
levelled
across
the
table
come

the

flourishing
a
great
fist

and
he
smote
the
table
a
blow

round
upon
his
hearers
more
especially
the
man
so
blackly
that
one
or
two
of
them
shuffled
uneasily
and
the
latter
individual

to
become
interested
in
the
lock
of
his
pistol

empty
tankard
i
crossed
the
room
and
touched
cragg
upon
the
shoulder
i
will
fight
you
said
i
for
a
guinea
now
as
the
fellow
eyes
met
mine
he
rose
up
out
of
his
chair
and
his
mouth
opened
slowly
but
he
spoke
no
word
backing
from
me
until
he
was
stayed
by
the
table
where
he
stood
staring
at
me
and
once
again
there
fell
a
silence
in
which
i
heard
the
tick
of
the
clock
in
the
corner
and
the
crackle
of
the
logs
upon
the
hearth
you
said
he
recovering
himself
with
an
effort
you
and
as
he
spoke
i
saw
his
left
eyelid
twitch
suddenly
exactly
i
answered
i
think
i
can
stand
up
to
even
you
for
five
minutes
now
as
i
spoke
he
winked
at
me
again
that
it
was
meant
for
me
was
certain
seeing
that
his
back
was
towards
the
others
though
what
he
intended
to
convey
i
could
form
no
idea
so
i
assumed
as
confident
an
air
as
possible
and
waited
hereupon
the
man
broke
into
a
sudden
raucous
laugh
in
which
the
others
joined
to
lads
he
cried
pointing
to
me
with
the
stern
of
his
pipe
be
a
fine
un
to

peering
up
at
me
beneath
his
hand
is
they
whiskers
at
me
over
cravat
or
do
my
eyes
deceive
me
which
pleasantry
called
forth
another
roar
of
laughter
at
my
expense
now
very
foolishly
perhaps
this
nonsense
greatly
exasperated
me
for
i
was
at
that
time
painfully
conscious
of
my
bare
lips
and
chin
it
was
therefore
with
an
effort
that
i
mastered
my
quickly
rising
temper
and
once
more
addressed
myself
to
cragg
i
am
willing
said
i
to
accept
your
conditions
and
fight
you
for
a
guinea
or
any
other
man
here
for
that
matter
except
the
humorous
gentleman
with
the
watery
eye
who
can
name
his
own
price
the
fellow
in
question
stared
at
me
glanced
slowly
round
and
sitting
down
buried
his
face
in
his
tankard
come
tom
cragg
said
i
a
while
ago
you
seemed
very
anxious
for
a
man
to
fight
well
i
your
man
and
with
the
words
i
stripped
off
my
coat
and
laid
it
across
a
chairback
this
apparent
willingness
on
my
part
was
but
a
cloak
for
my
real
feelings
for
i
will
not
here
disguise
the
fact
that
the
prospect
before
me
was
anything
but
agreeable
indeed
my
heart
was
thumping
in
a
most
unpleasant
manner
and
my
tongue
and
lips
had
become
strangely
parched
and
dry
as
i
fronted
cragg
truly
he
looked
dangerous
enough
with
his
beetling
brow
his
great
depth
of
chest
and
massive
shoulders
and
the
possibility
of
a
black
eye
or
so
and
general
pounding
from
the
fellow
knotted
fists
was
daunting
in
the
extreme
still
the
chance
of
earning
a
guinea
even
under
such
conditions
was
not
to
be
lightly
thrown
away
therefore
i
folded
my
arms
and
waited
with
as
much
resolution
as
i
could
sir
said
cragg
speaking
in
a
very
altered
tone
sir
you
seem
oncommon
eager
for
it
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
it
over
said
i
if
he
went
on
slowly
if
i
said
anything
against
you
know
who
sorry
for
it
me
the
greatest
respec
for
you
know
who
you
understand
me
i
think
and
herewith
he
winked
three
separate
and
distinct
times
no
i
do
understand
you
in
the
least
said
i
nor
do
i
think
it
at
all
necessary
all
that
i
care
about
is
the
guinea
in
question
come
tom
cried
one
of
the
company
knock
off
to
begin
with
ay
set
about
tom
cut
your
gab
an
finish
and
here
came
the
clatter
of
chairs
as
the
company
rose
ca
be
done
said
cragg
shaking
his
head
leastways
not
i
not
particular
said
i
if
you
prefer
we
might
manage
it
very
well
in
the
stable
with
a
couple
of
lanthorns
the
barn
would
be
the
very
place
suggested
the
landlord
bustling
eagerly
forward
and
wiping
his
hands
on
his
apron
the
very
place
plenty
of
room
and
nice
and
soft
to
fall
on
if
you
would
only
put
off
your
fightin
till
we
might
cry
it
through
the
villages
be
a
big
draw
ecod
we
might
make
a
purse
o
twenty
pound
if
you
only
would
think
it
over
think
it
over
i
hope
to
be
a
good
distance
from
here
said
i
come
the
sooner
it
is
over
the
better
show
us
your
barn
so
the
landlord
called
for
lanthorns
and
led
the
way
to
a
large
outbuilding
at
the
back
of
the
inn
into
which
we
all
trooped
it
seems
to
be
a
good
place
and
very
suitable
said
i
you
may
well
say
that
returned
the
landlord
it
many
a
fine
bout
as
has
been
brought
off
in
the
time
jem
belcher
beat
young
ruffian
the
prince
o
wales
sat
in
a
cheer
over
in
that
theer
corner
ah
that
was
a
day
if
you
please
if
tom
cragg
is
ready
said
i
turning
up
the
wristbands
of
my
shirt
why
so
am
i
here
it
was
found
to
every
one
surprise
and
mine
in
particular
that
tom
cragg
was
not
in
the
barn
surprise
gave
place
to
noisy
astonishment
when
after
much
running
to
and
fro
it
was
further
learned
that
he
had
vanished
altogether
the
inn
itself
the
stables
and
even
the
haylofts
were
ransacked
without
avail
tom
cragg
was
gone
as
completely
as
though
he
had
melted
into
thin
air
and
with
him
all
my
hopes
of
winning
the
guinea
and
a
comfortable
bed
it
was
with
all
my
old
dejection
upon
me
therefore
that
i
returned
to
the
and
refusing
the
officious
aid
of
the
man
put
on
my
coat
readjusted
my
knapsack
and
crossed
to
the
door
on
the
threshold
i
paused
and
looked
back
if
said
i
glancing
round
the
ring
of
faces
if
there
is
any
man
here
who
is
at
all
willing
to
fight
for
a
guinea
ten
shillings
or
even
five
i
should
be
very
glad
of
the
chance
to
earn
it
but
seeing
how
each
wilfully
avoiding
my
eye
held
his
peace
i
sighed
and
turning
my
back
upon
them
set
off
along
the
darkening
road
chapter
vii
of
the
further
puzzling
behavior
of
tom
cragg
the
pugilist
evening
had
fallen
and
i
walked
along
in
no
very
happy
frame
of
mind
the
more
so
as
the
rising
wind
and
flying
wrack
of
clouds
above
through
which
a
watery
moon
had
peeped
at
fitful
intervals
seemed
to
presage
a
wild
night
it
needed
but
this
to
make
my
misery
the
more
complete
for
as
far
as
i
could
tell
if
i
slept
at
all
and
i
was
already
very
weary
it
must
of
necessity
be
beneath
some
hedge
or
tree
as
i
approached
the
brow
of
the
hill
i
suddenly
remembered
that
i
must
once
more
pass
the
gibbet
and
began
to
strain
my
eyes
for
it
presently
i
spied
it
sure
enough
its
grim
gaunt
outline
looming
through
the
murk
and
instinctively
i
quickened
my
stride
so
as
to
pass
it
as
soon
as
might
be
i
was
almost
abreast
of
it
when
a
figure
rose
from
beneath
it
and
slouched
into
the
road
to
meet
me
i
stopped
there
and
then
and
grasping
my
heavy
staff
waited
its
approach
be
that
you
sir
said
a
voice
and
i
recognized
the
voice
of
tom
cragg
what
are
you
doing
and
there
of
all
places
oh
i
ai
afeared
of
answered
cragg
jerking
his
thumb
towards
the
gibbet
i
ai
afeard
o
none
as
ever
drawed
breath
dead
or
livin
except
it
be
the
prince
regent
and
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
as
theer
no
offence
my
lord
said
he
knuckling
his
forehead
and
speaking
in
a
tone
that
was
a
strange
mixture
of
comradeship
and
cringing
servility
cragg

my

leastways
not

but
and
what
the
devil

that
got
to

said
i
angrily

said
the
fellow
with

sly
leer
arter

i

as

and
i

that
you

i
if
you
still
wish
to
fight
for
any
sum
no
matter
how
small
put
up
your
hands
if
not
get
out
of
my
road
the
craggy
one
stepped
aside
somewhat
hastily
which
done
he
removed
his
hat
and
stood
staring
and
scratching
his
as
one
in
sore
perplexity
i
seen
a
many
rum
goes
in
my
time
said
he
but
i
never
see
so
rummy
a
go
as
this
strike
me
dead
so
i
left
him
and
strode
on
down
the
hill
as
i
went
the
moon
shot
out
a
feeble
ray
through
some
rift
in
the
rolling
clouds
and
looking
back
i
saw
him
standing
where
i
had
left
him
beneath
the
gibbet
still
scratching
his
bullethead
and
staring
after
me
down
the
hill
now
though
the
whole
attitude
and
behavior
of
the
fellow
was
puzzling
to
no
small
degree
my
mind
was
too
full
of
my
own
concerns
to
give
much
thought
to
him
indeed
scarce
was
he
out
of
my
sight
but
i
forgot
him
altogether
for
what
with
my
weariness
the
long
dark
road
before
and
behind
me
and
my
empty
pockets
i
became
a
prey
to
great
dejection
so
much
so
that
i
presently
sank
wearily
beside
the
way
and
resting
my
chin
in
my
hands
sat
there
miserably
enough
watching
the
night
deepen
about
me
and
yet
said
i
to
myself
if
as
epictetus
says
despise
a
thing
is
to
possess
it
then
am
i
rich
for
i
have
always
despised
money
and
if
weary
as
i
am
i
can
manage
to
condemn
the
luxury
of
a
feather
bed
then
tonight
lying
in
this
grassy
ditch
beneath
the
stars
i
shall
slumber
as
sweetly
as
ever
i
did
between
the
snowy
sheets
saying
which
i
rose
and
began
to
look
about
for
some
likely
nook
in
the
hedge
where
i
might
pass
the
night
i
was
thus
engaged
when
i
heard
the
creak
of
wheels
and
the
pleasant
rhythmic
jingle
of
harness
on
the
dark
hill
above
and
in
a
little
while
a
great
wagon
or
wain
piled
high
with
hay
hove
into
view
the
driver
of
which
rolled
loosely
in
his
seat
with
every
jolt
of
the
wheels
so
that
it
was
a
wonder
he
did
not
roll
off
altogether
as
he
came
level
with
me
i
hailed
him
loudly
whereupon
he
started
erect
and
brought
his
horses
to
a
stand
hulloa
he
bellowed
in
the
loud
strident
tone
of
one
rudely
awakened
do
want
wi
i
a
lift
i
answered
will
you
give
a
tired
fellow
a
lift
on
his
way
i
dunno

you
a
talkin
chap
i
do
think

said
i
because
if
you
be
a
talkin
chap

so
if
you
a
talkin
chap

do
get
no

i
am
generally
a
very
silent

said
i
besides

and
sleepy

man
then

my
chap
i
sleepy
too
i
allus
am
lord
love
ye
theer
nowt
like
sleep
up
wi
you
my
chap
forthwith
up
i
clambered
and
laying
myself
down
among
the
fragrant
hay
stretched
out
my
tired
limbs
and
sighed
never
shall
i
forget
the
delicious
sense
of
restfulness
that
stole
over
me
as
i
lay
there
upon
my
back
listening
to
the
creak
of
the
wheels
the
deliberate
of
the
horses
muffled
in
the
thick
dust
of
the
road
and
the
gentle
snore
of
the
driver
who
had
promptly
fallen
asleep
again
on
we
went
as
if
borne
on
air
so
soft
was
my
bed
now
beneath
the
branches
of
trees
sometimes
so
low
that
i
could
have
touched
them
with
my
hand
now
beneath
a
sky
heavy
with
sombre
masses
of
flying
cloud
or
bright
with
the
soft
radience
of
the
moon
on
i
went
careless
alike
of
destination
of
time
and
of
future
content
to
lie
there
upon
the
hay
and
rest
and
so
lulled
by
the
gentle
movement
by
the
sound
of
wheels
and
harness
and
the
whisper
of
the
soft
wind
about
me
i
presently
fell
into
a
most
blessed
sleep
chapter
viii
which
concerns
itself
with
a
farmer
whiskers
and
a
waistcoat
how
long
i
slept
i
have
no
idea
but
when
i
opened
my
eyes
it
was
to
find
the
moon
shining
down
on
me
from
a
cloudless
heaven
the
wind
also
had
died
away
it
seemed
my
early
fears
of
a
wild
night
were
not
to
be
fulfilled
and
for
this
i
was
sufficiently
grateful
now
as
i
lay
blinking
up
to
the
moon
i
presently
noticed
that
we
had
come
to
a
standstill
and
i
listened
expectantly
for
the
jingle
of
harness
and
creak
of
the
wheels
to
recommence
strange
said
i
to
myself
after
having
waited
vainly
some
little
time
and
wondering
what
could
cause
the
delay
i
sat
up
and
looked
about
me
the
first
object
my
eyes
encountered
was
a
haystack
and
beyond
that
another
with
a
little
to
one
side
a
row
of
barns
and
again
beyond
these
a
great
rambling
farmhouse
evidently
the
wain
had
reached
its
destination
wherever
that
might
be
and
the
sleepy
wagoner
forgetful
of
my
presence
had
tumbled
off
to
bed
the
which
i
thought
so
excellent
an
example
that
i
lay
down
again
and
drawing
the
loose
hay
over
me
closed
my
eyes
and
once
more
fell
asleep
my
second
awakening
was
gradual
i
at
first
became
conscious
of
a
sound
rising
and
falling
with
a
certain
monotonous
regularity
that
my
drowsy
ears
could
make
nothing
of
little
by
little
however
the
sound
developed
itself
into
a
somewhat
mournful
melody
or
refrain
chanted
by
a
not
unmusical
voice
i
yawned
and
having
stretched
myself
sat
up
to
look
and
listen
and
the
words
of
the
song
were
these
when
a
man
who
muffins
cries
cries
not
when
his
father
dies
is
a
proof
that
he
would
rather
have
a
muffin
than
his
father
the
singer
was
a
tall
strapping
fellow
with
a
face
whose
ruddy
health
was
set
off
by
a
handsome
pair
of
black
whiskers
as
i
watched
him
he
laid
aside
the
pitchfork
he
had
been
using
and
approached
the
wagon
but
chancing
to
look
up
his
eye
met
mine
and
he
stopped
hulloa
he
exclaimed
breaking
short
off
in
the
middle
of
a
note
hulloa
hallo
said
i
be
doin
up
theer
i
was
thinking
i
returned
that
under
certain
circumstances
i
for
one
could
not
blame
the
individual
mentioned
in
your
song
for
his
passionate
attachment
to
muffins
at
this
precise
moment
a
muffin
or
say
five
or
six
would
be
highly
acceptable
personally
be
you
partial
to
muffins
then
yes
indeed
said
i
more
especially
seeing
i
have
not
broken
my
fast
since
midday
yesterday
well
an
be
doin
in
my
hay
i
have
been
asleep
said
i
well
an
what
business
ye
got
an
in
my
hay
i
was
tired
said
i
and
her
custom
holds
let
shame
say
what
it
will
still
i
do
not
think
i
snored
do
i
know
that
or
you
for
that
matter
rejoined
the
farmer
stroking
his
glossy
whiskers
if
you
be
quite
awake
come
on
down
out
o
my
hay
as
he
said
this
he
eyed
me
with
rather
a
truculent
air
likewise
he
clenched
his
fist
thinking
it
wisest
to
appear
unconscious
of
this
i
nodded
affably
and
letting
myself
down
from
the
hay
was
next
moment
standing
beside
him
supposin
i
was
to
thump
on
the
nose
he
inquired
what
for
for
makin
so
free
wi
my
hay
why
then
said
i
i
should
earnestly
endeavor
to
thump
you
on
yours
the
farmer
looked
me
slowly
over
from
head
to
foot
with
a
dawning
surprise
thought
you
was
a
common
tramper
i
did
said
he
why
so
i
am
i
answered
brushing
the
clinging
hay
from
me
trampers
o
the
road
do
wear
gentlemen
clothes
leastways
i
never
see
one
as
did
here
his
eyes
wandered
over
me
again
from
my
boots
upward
up
they
stopped
evidently
arrested
by
my
waistcoat
a
flowered
satin
of
the
very
latest
cut
for
which
i
had
paid
forty
shillings
in
the
haymarket
scarcely
a
week
before
and
as
i
looked
down
at
it
i
would
joyfully
have
given
it
and
every
waistcoat
that
was
ever
cut
to
have
had
that
forty
shillings
safe
back
in
my
pocket
again
that
be
a
mighty
fine
weskit
sir
do
you
think
so
said
i
ah
that
i
do
might
be
the
cost
of
a
weskit
the
like
o
that
now
i
paid
forty
shillings
for
it
in
the
haymarket
in
london
scarcely
a
week
ago
i
answered
the
fellow
very
slowly
closed
one
eye
at
the
same
time
striking
his
nose
three
successive
raps
with
his
forefinger
gammon
said
he
none
the
less
it
true
said
i
any
man
as
would
give
forty
shillin
for
a
garment
as
is
no
mortal
good
agen
the
cold
not
reachin
fur
enough
even
if
it
do
be
silk
all
worked
wi
little
flowers
is
a
dommed
fool
assuredly
said
i
with
a
nod
howsomever
he
continued
it
a
handsome
weskit
there
no
denyin
an
well
worth
a
woman
lookin
at
a
proper
man
inside
of
it
not
a
doubt
of
it
said
i
i
mean
said
he
scratching
his
ear
and
staring
hard
at
the
handle
of
the
pitchfork
a
chap
wi
a
fine
pair
o
whiskers
say
hum
said
i
now
woman
he
went
on
shifting
his
gaze
to
the
top
button
of
his
left
gaiter
woman
is
uncommon
fond
o
a
good
pair
whiskers
leastways
so
i
heerd
indeed
said
i
few
women
can
look
upon
such
things
unmoved
i
believe
and
nothing
can
set
off
a
pair
of
fine
black
whiskers
better
than
a
flowered
satin
waistcoat
that
so
nodded
the
farmer
but
unfortunately
said
i
passing
my
hand
over
my
smooth
lips
and
chin
i
have
no
whiskers
no
returned
the
farmer
with
a
thoughtful
shake
of
the
head
leastways
none
as
i
can
observe
now
you
have
said
i
so
they
do
tell
me
he
answered
modestly
and
the
natural
inference
is
that
you
ought
to
have
a
flowered
waistcoat
to
go
with
them
why
that
true
to
be
sure
he
nodded
the
price
of
this
one
is
fifteen
shillings
said
i
that
a
lot
o
money
master
said
he
shaking
his
head
it
a
great
deal
less
than
forty
said
i
an
ten
is
less
than
fifteen
an
ten
shillin
is
my
price
what
d
say
come
now
you
drive
a
hard
bargain
said
i
but
the
waistcoat
is
yours
at
your
own
price
so
saying
i
slipped
off
knapsack
and
coat
and
removing
the
garment
in
question
having
first
felt
through
the
pockets
handed
it
to
him
whereupon
he
slowly
counted
the
ten
shillings
into
my
hand
which
done
he
sat
down
upon
the
shaft
of
a
cart
near
by
and
spreading
out
the
waistcoat
on
his
knees
looked
it
over
with
glistening
eyes
forty
shillin
you
paid
for
up
to
lunnon
said
he
forty
shillin
it
were
i
think
forty
shillings
said
i
ecod
it
a
sight
o
money
but
it
a
grand
weskit
ah
that
it
is
so
you
believe
me
now
do
you
said
i
pocketing
the
ten
shillings
well
he
answered
slowly
i
wo
go
so
fur
as
that
but
is
a
mighty
fine
weskit
theer
no
denyin
an
must
ha
cost
a
sight
money
a
powerful
sight
i
picked
up
my
knapsack
and
slipping
it
on
took
my
staff
and
turned
to
depart
theer
a
mug
o
homebrewed
a
slice
o
fine
roast
beef
up
at
th
if
you
should
be
so
inclined
why

to
that
said
i
over
my
shoulder
i

nor
drink
with
a
man
who
doubts
my
word
meanin
those
forty
shillin
precisely
well
said
he
twisting
his
whisker
with
a
thoughtful
air
if
you
could
manage
to
mak
it
twenty
or
even
i
might
mak
some
shift
to
believe
it
though
be
a
strain

of
the
road
i
answered
then

said
i
being
come
to
the
gate
of
the
yard
i
paused
there
is
one
favor
you
might
grant
me
said
i
as
what
master
five
minutes
under
the
pump
yonder
and
a
clean
towel
the
farmer
nodded
and
crossing
to
one
of
the
outhouses
presently
returned
with
a
towel
and
resting
the
towel
upon
the
he
seized
the
handle
and
sent
a
jet
of
clear
cool
water
over
my
head
and
face
and
hands
you
got
a
tidy
sizeable
arm
said
he
as
i
dried
myself
vigorously
likewise
a
good
strong
back
an
shoulders
theer
the
makin
of
a
man
in
you
as
might
do
summat
say
in
the
plough
or
smithin
way
but
it
easy
to
see
as
you
a
gentleman
more
the
pity
an
wo
sir
if
you
a
mind
to
a
cut
o
good
beef
an
a
mug
o
fine
ale
say
the
word
first
said
i
do
you
believe
it
was
forty
shillings
yes
or
no
the
farmer
twisted
his
whisker
and
stared
very
hard
at
the
spout
of
the
pump
tell
what
said
he
at
length
mak
it
thirty
an
i
give
ye
my
bible
oath
to
do
the
best
wi
it
i
can
then
i
must
needs

my
breakfast
at
the
nearest
inn
said
i
an
that
is
the
cock
a
mile
an
a
half
nearer
tonbridge
then
the
sooner
i
start
the
better
said
i
for
i
mightily
sharp
set
why
as
to
that
said
he
busy
with
his
whisker
again
i
might
stretch
a
pint
or
two
an
call
it
at
a
pinch
what
d
say
why
i
say
morning
and
many
of
them
and
opening
the
gate
i
started
off
down
the
road
at
a
brisk
pace
now
as
i
went
it
began
to
rain
chapter
ix
in
which
i
stumble
upon
an
affair
of
honor
there
are
times
as
i
suppose
when
the
most
aesthetic
of
souls
will
forget
the
snow
of
lilies
and
the
down
of
a
butterfly
wing
to
revel
in
the
grosser
joys
of
say
a
beefsteak
one
can
not
rhapsodize
upon
the
beauties
of
a
sunset
or
contemplate
the
pale
witchery
of
the
moon
with
any
real
degree
of
poetic
fervor
or
any
degree
of
comfort
while
hunger
gnaws
at
one
vitals
for
comfort
is
essential
to
your
aesthete
and
after
all
soul
goes
hand
in
hand
with
stomach
thus
i
swung
along
the
road
beneath
the
swaying
green
of
trees
past
the
fragrant
blooming
hedges
paying
small
heed
to
the
beauties
of
wooded
hill
and
grassy
dale
my
eyes
constantly
searching
the
road
before
me
for
some
sign
of
the
old
cock
tavern
and
presently
sure
enough
i
espied
it
an
ugly
building
before
which
stood
a
dilapidated
horse
trough
and
a
battered
sign
despite
its
uninviting
exterior
i
hurried
forward
and
mounting
the
three
worn
steps
pushed
open
the
door
i
now
found
myself
in
a
room
of
somewhat
uninviting
aspect
though
upon
the
hearth
a
smouldering
fire
was
being
kicked
into
a
blaze
by
a
fellow
to
whom
i
addressed
myself
can
i
have
some
breakfast
here
said
i
why
it
all
according
master
he
answered
in
a
surly
tone
according
to
what
said
i
according
to
what
you
want
master
why
as
to
that
i
began
because
he
went
on
administering
a
particularly
vicious
kick
to
the
fire
if
you
was
to
ask
me
for
a
french
hortolon
or
even
the
of
a
being
a
very
truthful
man
i
should
say
no
but
i
want
no
such
things
said
i
and
am
i
to
know
that
am
i
to
know
as
you
ai
set
your
on
the
of
a
i
tell
you
i
want
nothing
of
the
sort
said
i
a
chop
would
do
chop
sighed
the
man
scowling
threateningly
at
the
fire
chop
or
steak
i
hastened
to
add
now
it
a
steak
said
the
man
shaking
his
head
ruefully
and
turning
upon
me
a
doleful
eye
a
steak
he
repeated
of
course
it
would
be
i
you
turn
up
your
nose
at
and
eggs
it
only
to
be
expected
on
the
contrary
said
i
ham
and
eggs
will
suit
me
very
well
why
could
you
have
mentioned
them
before
why
you
never
axed
me
as
i
remember
growled
the
fellow
slipping
my
knapsack
from
my
shoulders
i
sat
down
at
a
small
table
in
a
corner
while
the
man
with
a
final
kick
at
the
fire
went
to
give
my
order
in
a
few
minutes
he
reappeared
with
some
billets
of
wood
beneath
his
arm
and
followed
by
a
lass
who
proceeded
very
deftly
to
lay
a
snowy
cloth
and
thereupon
in
due
season
a
dish
of
savory
ham
and
eggs
it
a
lovely
morning
said
i
lifting
my
eyes
to
her
comely
face
it
is
indeed
sir
said
she
setting
down
the
cruet
with
a
turn
of
her
slender
wrist
which
i
make
so
bold
as
to
deny
said
the
surly
man
dropping
the
wood
on
the
hearth
with
a
prodigious
clatter
can
any
morning
be
lovely
when
there
ai
no
love
in
it
no
not
so
much
as
would
fill
a
thimble
i
say
it
ai
a
lovely
morning
not
by
no
manner
o
means
and
what
i
says
i
ai
ashamed
on
being
a
truthful
man
with
which
words
he
sighed
kicked
the
fire
again
and
stumped
out
our
friend
would
seem
somewhat
gloomy
this
morning
said
i
he
been
that
way
a
fortnight
now
come
replied
the
slim
lass
nodding
oh
said
i
yes
she
continued
checking
a
smile
and
sighing
instead
it
very
sad
he
been
crossed
in
love
you
see
sir
poor
fellow
said
i
ca
you
try
to
console
him
me
sir
oh
no
and
why
not
i
should
think
you
might
console
a
man
for
a
great
deal
why
you
see
sir
said
she
blushing
and
dimpling
very
prettily
it
do
so
happen
as
i
the
one
as
crossed
him
ah
i
understand
said
i
i
to
be
married
to
a
farmer
down
the
road
yonder
leastways
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
yet
a
fine
tall
fellow
i
inquired
yes
do
know
him
sir
with
a
handsome
pair
of
black
whiskers
said
i
the
very
same
sir
and
they
do
be
handsome
whiskers
though
i
do
say
it
the
finest
i
ever
saw
i
wish
you
every
happiness
said
i
thankee
sir
i
sure
said
she
and
dimpling
more
prettily
than
ever
she
tripped
away
and
left
me
to
my
repast
and
when
i
had
assuaged
my
hunger
i
took
out
the
pipe
of
adam
the
groom
the
pipe
shaped
like
a
negro
head
and
calling
for
a
paper
of
tobacco
i
filled
and
lighted
the
pipe
and
sat
staring
dreamily
out
of
the
window
happy
is
that
man
who
by
reason
of
an
abundant
fortune
knows
not
the
meaning
of
the
word
hunger
but
thrice
happy
is
he
who
when
the
hand
of
famine
pinches
may
stay
his
craving
with
such
a
meal
as
this
of
mine
never
before
and
never
since
have
i
tasted
just
such
eggs
and
such
ham
so
tender
so
delicate
so
full
of
flavor
it
is
a
memory
that
can
never
fade
indeed
sometimes
even
now
when
i
grow
hungry
about
i
see
once
more
the
man
the
and
the
gloomy
chamber
of
the
old
cock
tavern
as
i
saw
them
upon
that
early
may
morning
of
the
year
of
grace
so
i
sat
with
a
contented
mind
smoking
my
pipe
and
staring
out
at
the
falling
summer
rain
and
presently
chancing
to
turn
my
eyes
up
the
road
i
beheld
a
chaise
that
galloped
in
a
smother
of
mud
as
i
watched
its
rapid
approach
the
postilion
swung
his
horses
towards
the
inn
and
a
moment
later
had
pulled
up
before
the
door
they
had
evidently
travelled
fast
and
far
for
the
chaise
was
covered
with
dirt
and
the
poor
horses
in
a
lather
of
foam
hung
their
heads
while
their
flanks
heaved
distressfully
the
chaise
door
was
now
thrown
open
and
three
gentlemen
alighted
the
first
was
a
short
plethoric
individual
and
loud
of
voice
for
i
could
hear
him
roundly
cursing
the
for
some
fault
the
second
was
a
tall
languid
gentleman
who
carried
a
flat
oblong
box
beneath
one
arm
and
who
paused
to
fondle
his
whisker
and
look
up
at
the
inn
with
an
exaggerated
air
of
disgust
while
the
third
stood
mutely
by
his
hands
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
his
greatcoat
and
stared
straight
before
him
the
three
of
them
entered
the
room
together
and
while
the
languid
gentleman
paused
to
survey
himself
in
the
small
cracked
mirror
that
hung
against
the
wall
the
plethoric
individual
bustled
to
the
fire
and
loosening
his
coats
and
neckerchief
spread
out
his
hands
to
the
blaze
a
good
before
our
time
said
he
glancing
towards
the
third
gentleman
who
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
with
his
hands
still
deep
in
his
pockets
we
did
the
last
ten
miles
well
under
the
hour
come
what
do
you
say
to
a
glass
of
brandy
at
this
his
languid
companion
turned
from
the
mirror
and
i
noticed
that
he
too
glanced
at
the
silent
figure
by
the
window
by
all
means
said
he
though
sir
jasper
would
hardly
seem
in
a
drinking
humor
and
with
the
very
slightest
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
turned
back
to
the
mirror
again
no
chester
i
am
not
in
a
drinking
humor
answered
sir
jasper
without
turning
round
or
taking
his
eyes
from
the
window
sir
jasper
said
i
to
myself
now
where
and
in
what
connection
have
i
heard
such
a
name
before
he
was
of
a
slight
build
and
seemingly
younger
than
either
of
his
companions
by
some
years
but
what
struck
me
particularly
about
him
was
the
extreme
pallor
of
his
face
i
noticed
also
a
peculiar
habit
he
had
of
moistening
his
lips
at
frequent
intervals
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
and
there
was
besides
something
in
the
way
he
stared
at
the
trees
the
wet
road
and
the
gray
sky
a
strange
intensity
that
drew
and
held
my
attention
devilish
weather
devilish
on
my
life
and
soul
exclaimed
the
short
man
in
a
loud
peevish
tone
tugging
viciously
at
the
hot
one
day
cold
the
next
now
sun
now
rain
oh
damn
it
now
in
france
ah
what
a
climate
heavenly
positively
divine
say
what
you
will
of
a
frenchman
damn
him
by
all
means
but
the
climate
the
country
and
the
women
who
would
not
worship
exactly
said
the
languid
gentleman
examining
a
pimple
upon
his
chin
with
a
high
degree
of
interest
always
a
frenchwoman
myself
they
so
so
ah
so
deuced
french
though
mark
you
selby
he
broke
off
as
the
maid
appeared
with
the
brandy
and
glasses
though
mark
you
there
much
to
be
said
for
your
english
country
wenches
after
all
saying
which
he
slipped
his
arm
about
the
round
waist
there
was
the
sound
of
a
kiss
a
muffled
shriek
and
she
had
run
from
the
room
slamming
the
door
behind
her
whereupon
the
languid
gentleman
went
back
to
his
pimple
oh
as
to
that
chester
i
quarrel
only
with
the
climate
god
made
england
and
the
devil
sends
the
weather
selby
said
sir
jasper
in
the
same
repressed
tone
that
he
had
used
before
and
still
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
gray
prospect
of
sky
and
tree
and
winding
road
there
is
no
fairer
land
in
all
the
world
than
this
england
of
ours
it
were
a
good
thing
to
die
for
england
but
that
is
a
happiness
reserved
for
comparatively
few
and
with
the
words
he
sighed
a
strange
fluttering
sigh
and
thrust
his
hands
deeper
into
his
pockets
die
repeated
the
man
selby
in
a
loud
boisterous
way
who
talks
of
death
deuced
unpleasant
subject
said
the
other
with
a
shrug
at
the
cracked
mirror
something
so
infernally
cold
and
clammy
about
it
like
the
weather
and
yet
it
will
be
a
glorious
day
later
the
clouds
are
thinning
already
sir
jasper
went
on
strange
but
i
never
realized
until
this
morning
how
green
and
wonderful
everything
is
the
languid
chester
forgot
the
mirror
and
turned
to
stare
at
sir
jasper
back
with
raised
brows
while
the
man
selby
shook
his
head
and
smiled
unpleasantly
as
he
did
so
his
eye
encountered
me
where
i
sat
quietly
in
my
corner
smoking
my
pipe
and
his
thick
brows
twitched
sharply
together
in
a
frown
in
an
hour
time
gentlemen
pursued
sir
jasper
we
shall
write
to
a
more
or
less
interesting
incident
and
i
beg
of
you
in
that
hour
to
remember
my
prophecy
that
it
would
be
a
glorious
day
later
chester
filled
a
glass
and
crossing
to
the
speaker
tendered
it
to
him
without
a
word
as
for
selby
he
stood
stolidly
enough
his
hands
thrust
truculently
beneath
his
frowning
at
me
come
said
chester
persuasively
just
a
bracer
sir
jasper
shook
his
head
but
next
moment
reached
out
a
white
unsteady
hand
and
raised
the
brandy
to
his
lips
yet
as
he
drank
i
saw
the
spirit
slop
over
and
trickle
from
his
chin
thanks
chester
said
he
returning
the
empty
glass
is
it
time
we
started
yet
it
just
seven
answered
chester
consulting
his
watch
and
i
rather
hazy
as
to
the
exact
place
deepdene
wood
said
sir
jasper
dreamily
you
know
the
place
oh
yes
then
we
may
as
well
start
if
you
are
ready
yes
it
will
be
cool
and
fresh
outside
settle
the
bill
selby
we
walk
on
slowly
said
chester
and
with
a
last
glance
at
the
mirror
he
slipped
his
arm
within
sir
jasper
and
they
went
out
together
selby
meanwhile
rang
for
the
bill
frowning
at
me
all
the
time
what
the
devil
are
you
staring
at
he
demanded
suddenly
in
a
loud
bullying
tone
if
you
are
pleased
to
refer
to
me
sir
said
i
i
would
say
that
my
eyes
were
given
for
use
and
that
having
used
them
upon
you
i
have
long
since
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
i
do
like
you
ah
said
he
frowning
fiercer
than
ever
yes
said
i
though
whether
it
is
your
person
your
manner
or
your
voice
that
displeases
me
most
i
am
unable
to
say
an
impertinent
young
jackanapes
said
he
damnation
i
think
pull
your
nose
why
you
may
try
and
welcome
sir
said
i
though
i
should
advise
you
not
for
should
you
make
the
attempt
i
should
be
compelled
to
throw
you
out
of
the
window
at
this
moment
the
pretty
maid
appeared
and
tendered
him
the
bill
with
a
curtesy
he
glanced
at
it
tossed
some
money
upon
the
table
and
turned
to
stare
at
me
again
if
ever
i
meet
you
again
he
began
you
probably
know
me
i
put
in
without
a
doubt
he
answered
putting
on
his
hat
and
buttoning
his
befrogged
surtout
and
should
you
he
continued
drawing
on
his
gloves
should
you
stare
at
me
with
those
damned
impertinent
eyes
of
yours
i
should
most
certainly
pull
your
nose
for
you
on
the
spot
sir
and
i
should
as
certainly
throw
you
out
of
the
window
i
nodded
an
impertinent
young
jackanapes
said
he
again
and
went
out
banging
the
door
behind
him
glancing
from
the
window
i
saw
him
catch
up
with
the
other
two
and
all
three
walk
on
together
down
the
road
sir
jasper
was
in
the
middle
and
i
noticed
that
his
hands
were
still
deep
in
his
pockets
now
as
i
watched
their
forms
getting
smaller
and
smaller
in
the
distance
there
grew
upon
me
a
feeling
that
he
who
walked
between
would
nevermore
come
walking
back
and
in
a
little
having
knocked
out
my
pipe
upon
my
palm
i
called
for
and
settled
my
score
as
i
rose
the
pretty
chambermaid
picked
up
my
knapsack
from
the
corner
and
blushing
aided
me
to
put
it
on
my
dear
thank
you
said
i
and
kissed
her
this
time
she
neither
shrieked
nor
ran
from
the
room
she
merely
blushed
a
trifle
rosier
do
you
think
i
have
fishes
eyes
my
dear
la
no
sir
handsome
they
be
i
sure
so
bright
an
black
an
little
lights
in
them
there
sir
do
ha
done
and
go
along
wi
you
by
the
way
i
said
pausing
upon
the
worn
steps
and
looking
back
at
her
by
the
way
how
far
is
it
to
deepdene
wood
chapter
x
which
relates
the
end
of
an
honorable
affair
some
along
the
road
upon
the
left
hand
was
a
stile
and
beyond
the
stile
a
path
a
path
that
led
away
over
field
and
meadow
and
winding
stream
to
the
blue
verge
of
distant
woods
now
midway
between
these
woods
and
the
place
where
i
stood
there
moved
three
figures
and
far
away
though
they
were
i
could
still
make
out
that
the
middle
one
walked
with
his
hands
those
tremulous
betraying
hands
thrust
deep
within
his
pockets
and
presently
i
climbed
the
stile
and
set
off
along
the
path
sir
jasper
said
i
to
myself
somewhere
in
the
background
of
my
consciousness
i
had
a
vague
recollection
of
having
heard
mention
of
such
a
name
before
but
exactly
when
and
where
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
remember
sir
jasper
said
i
to
myself
again
it
is
a
very
uncommon
name
and
should
be
easy
to
recollect
i
had
often
prided
myself
on
possessing
a
singularly
retentive
memory
more
especially
for
names
and
faces
but
upon
the
present
occasion
the
more
i
pondered
the
matter
the
more
hazy
i
became
so
i
walked
on
through
the
sweet
wet
grass
racking
my
brain
for
a
solution
of
the
problem
but
finding
none
when
i
again
looked
up
the
three
figures
had
vanished
where
the
path
took
a
sharp
bend
round
a
clump
of
pollard
oaks
and
determined
not
to
lose
them
i
hurried
my
steps
but
when
i
in
turn
rounded
the
corner
not
a
soul
was
in
sight
the
path
sloped
up
gently
before
me
with
a
thick
hedge
upon
my
right
and
after
crossing
a
brawling
stream
lost
itself
in
the
small
wood
or
coppice
that
crowned
the
ascent
wondering
i
hastened
forward
and
then
happening
to
look
through
the
hedge
which
grew
very
thick
and
high
i
stopped
all
at
once
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
was
a
strip
of
meadow
bounded
by
the
brook
i
have
mentioned
now
across
this
stream
was
a
small
rustic
bridge
and
on
this
bridge
was
a
man
midway
between
this
man
and
myself
stood
a
group
of
four
gentlemen
all
talking
very
earnestly
together
to
judge
by
their
actions
while
somewhat
apart
from
these
his
head
bent
his
hands
still
thrust
deep
in
his
pockets
stood
sir
jasper
and
from
him
for
no
apparent
reason
my
eyes
wandered
to
the
man
upon
the
bridge
a
tall
fellow
in
a
greatcoat
who
whistled
to
himself
and
stared
down
into
the
stream
swinging
his
tasselled
to
and
fro
all
at
once
as
if
in
response
to
some
signal
he
rose
and
unbuttoning
his
surtout
drew
it
off
and
flung
it
across
the
handrail
of
the
bridge
chester
was
on
his
knees
before
the
oblong
box
and
i
saw
the
glint
of
the
pistols
as
he
handed
them
up
the
distance
had
already
been
paced
and
marked
out
and
now
each
man
took
his
ground
sir
jasper
still
in
his
greatcoat
his
hat
over
his
eyes
his
neckerchief
loose
and
dangling
one
hand
in
his
pocket
the
other
grasping
his
weapon
his
antagonist
on
the
contrary
jaunty
and
debonnair
a
dandy
from
the
crown
of
his
hat
to
the
soles
of
his
shining
boots
their
arms
were
raised
almost
together
the
man
selby
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
a
handkerchief
fluttered
fell
and
in
that
instant
came
the
report
of
a
pistol
i
saw
sir
jasper
reel
backward
steady
himself
and
fire
in
return
then
while
the
blue
smoke
yet
hung
in
the
still
air
he
staggered
blindly
and
fell
chester
and
two
or
three
more
ran
forward
and
knelt
beside
him
while
his
opponent
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
taking
off
his
hat
pointed
out
the
bullet
hole
to
his
second
and
in
a
little
while
they
lifted
sir
jasper
in
their
arms
but
seeing
how
his
head
hung
a
sudden
sickness
came
upon
me
for
i
knew
indeed
that
he
would
go
walking
back
nevermore
yet
his
eyes
were
wide
and
staring
staring
up
at
the
blue
heaven
with
the
same
fixed
intensity
as
they
had
done
at
the
inn
then
i
too
looked
up
at
the
cloudless
sky
and
round
upon
the
fair
earth
and
in
that
moment
i
for
one
remembered
his
prophecy
of
an
hour
ago
and
indeed
the
day
was
glorious
chapter
xi
which
relates
a
brief
at
the
chequers
inn
in
due
season
i
came
into
tonbridge
town
and
following
the
high
street
presently
observed
a
fine
inn
upon
the
side
of
the
way
which
as
i
remember
is
called
the
chequers
and
here
were
divers
loiterers
lounging
round
the
door
or
seated
upon
the
benches
but
the
eyes
of
all
were
turned
the
one
way
and
presently
as
i
paused
before
the
inn
to
look
up
at
its
plaster
and
massive
there
issued
from
the
stable
yard
one
in
a
striped
waistcoat
with
and
a
red
face
who
took
a
straw
from
behind
his
ear
and
began
to
chew
it
meditatively
to
whom
i
now
addressed
myself
good
afternoon
said
i
arternoon
he
answered
a
fine
day
said
i
is
it
said
he
why
to
be
sure
it
is
said
i
somewhat
taken
aback
by
his
manner
to
be
sure
it
is
oh
said
he
and
shifted
the
straw
very
dexterously
from
one
corner
of
his
mouth
to
the
other
by
some
unseen
agency
and
stared
up
the
road
harder
than
ever
what
are
you
looking
at
i
inquired
said
he
and
why
do
you
look
at
the
hill
mail
said
he
oh
said
i
ah
said
he
is
it
the
london
coach
ah
said
he
does
it
stop
here
ah
said
he
do
you
ever
say
anything
much
beside
i
inquired
he
stopped
chewing
the
straw
and
with
his
eyes
on
the
distance
seemed
to
turn
this
question
over
in
his
mind
having
done
which
he
began
to
chew
again
ah
said
he
why
then
you
can
perhaps
tell
me
how
many
miles
it
is
five
said
he
i
was
about
to
ask
how
far
it
was
to
the
wells
said
he
why
yes
to
be
sure
but
how
did
you
know
that
it
use
said
he
what
do
you
mean
they
all
ask
said
he
who
do
tramps
said
he
oh
so
you
take
me
for
a
tramp
ah
said
he
and
you
said
i
put
me
in
mind
of
a
certain
friar
eh
said
he
frowning
a
little
at
the
hill
you
never
heard
of
rabelais
or
panurge
of
course
said
i
the
ostler
took
out
his
straw
eyed
it
thoughtfully
and
put
it
back
again
no
said
he
more
the
pity
said
i
and
was
about
to
turn
away
when
he
drew
the
nearest
fist
abruptly
from
his
pocket
and
extended
it
towards
me
look
at
that
he
commanded
rather
dirty
i
commented
but
otherwise
a
good
useful
member
i
make
no
doubt
it
said
he
alternately
drawing
in
and
shooting
out
the
fist
in
question
it
to
fill
your
eye
up
is
it
said
i
ah
said
he
but
what
for
i
are
a
semmy
nor
yet
a
quaver
an
as
for
friers
said
he
very
deliberately
why
frier
yourself
says
i
nevertheless
said
i
you
are
gifted
with
a
certain
terse
directness
of
speech
that
greatly
reminds
me
of
joe
he
called
out
suddenly
over
his
shoulder
mail
joe
lifting
my
eyes
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
i
could
see
nothing
save
a
faint
haze
which
however
gradually
grew
denser
and
thicker
and
out
from
this
gathering
cloud
soft
and
faint
with
distance
stole
the
silvery
notes
of
a
horn
now
i
saw
the
coach
itself
and
as
i
watched
it
rapidly
descending
the
hill
i
longed
to
be
upon
it
with
the
sun
above
the
smooth
road
below
and
the
wind
rushing
through
my
hair
on
it
came
at
a
gallop
rocking
and
swaying
a
good
fifteen
miles
an
hour
on
it
came
plunging
into
the
green
shade
of
trees
and
out
into
the
sun
again
with
ever
the
gathering
dust
cloud
behind
while
clear
and
high
rang
the
cheery
note
of
the
horn
and
now
from
the
cool
shadows
of
the
inn
yard
there
rose
a
prodigious
stamping
of
hoofs
rattling
of
chains
and
swearing
of
oaths
and
out
came
four
fresh
horses
led
by
two
men
each
of
whom
wore
topboots
a
striped
waistcoat
and
chewed
upon
straws
and
now
the
coach
swung
round
the
bend
and
came
thundering
down
upon
the
chequers
chains
jingling
wheels
rumbling
horn
braying
and
with
a
stamp
and
ring
of
hoof
pulled
up
before
the
inn
and
then
what
a
running
to
and
fro
what
a
prodigious
unbuckling
and
buckling
of
straps
while
the
coachman
fanned
himself
with
his
hat
and
swore
jovially
at
the
ostlers
and
the
ostlers
swore
back
at
the
coachman
and
the
guard
and
the
coach
and
the
horses
individually
and
collectively
in
the
midst
of
which
confusion
down
came
the
window
with
a
bang
and
out
of
the
window
came
a
flask
and
a
hand
and
an
arm
and
last
of
all
a
great
fat
face
round
and
mottled
and
roaring
as
it
came
oho
i
say
damn
it
damn
everybody
eyes
and
bones
brandy
o
yoho
house
i
say
brandy
guard
landlord
ostlers
brandy
d
hear
i
say
what
the
devil
am
i
to
die
for
want
of
a
drop
of
brandy
oho
now
little
by
little
i
became
conscious
how
i
can
not
define
that
i
was
the
object
of
a
close
and
persistent
scrutiny
that
i
was
being
watched
and
stared
at
by
some
one
near
by
shifting
my
eyes
therefore
from
the
mottled
face
at
the
coach
window
i
cast
them
swiftly
about
until
they
presently
met
those
of
one
of
the
four
outside
passengers
a
tall
man
who
leaned
far
out
from
the
coach
roof
watching
me
intently
and
his
face
was
thin
and
very
pale
and
the
eyes
which
stared
into
mine
glowed
beneath
a
jagged
prominence
of
brow
at
the
time
though
i
wondered
at
the
man
expression
and
the
fixity
of
his
gaze
i
paid
him
no
further
heed
but
turned
my
attention
back
to
who
had
by
this
time
bellowed
himself
purple
howbeit
in
due
time
the
flask
having
been
replenished
and
handed
to
him
he
dived
back
into
the
recesses
of
the
coach
jerked
up
the
window
and
vanished
as
suddenly
as
he
had
appeared
but
now
the
four
fresh
horses
were
in
and
harnessed
capering
and
dancing
with
an
ostler
at
the
head
of
each
the
driver
tossed
off
his
glass
of
rum
and
water
cast
an
eye
up
at
the
clouds
remarked
wind
by
gemini
settled
his
feet
against
the
dashboard
and
gathered
up
the
reins
and
now
too
the
guard
appeared
wiping
his
lips
as
he
came
who
also
cast
an
eye
up
at
the
heavens
remarked
dust
by
jingo
and
swung
himself
up
into
the
rumble
all
right
behind
sang
out
the
driver
over
his
shoulder
all
right
sang
back
the
guard
then
let
go
cried
the
driver
whereupon
the
ostlers
jumped
nimbly
back
the
horses
threw
up
their
heads
and
danced
undecidedly
for
a
moment
the
long
whip
cracked
hoofs
clattered
sparks
flew
and
rumbling
and
creaking
off
went
the
london
mail
with
such
a
flourish
of
the
horn
as
woke
many
a
sleepy
echo
near
and
far
as
i
turned
away
i
noticed
that
there
remained
but
three
outside
passengers
the
man
had
evidently
alighted
yet
although
i
glanced
round
for
him
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
hereupon
being
in
no
mind
to
undergo
the
operation
of
having
my
eye
filled
up
and
moreover
finding
myself
thirsty
i
stepped
into
the
tap
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
outside
passenger
staring
moodily
out
of
the
window
and
with
an
untouched
mug
of
ale
at
his
elbow
opposite
him
sat
an
old
man
in
a
smock
frock
who
leaned
upon
a
talking
to
a
very
short
fat
man
behind
the
bar
who
took
my
twopence
with
a
smile
smiled
as
he
drew
my
ale
and
smiling
watched
me
drink
be
you
from
lunnon
sir
inquired
the
old
man
eyeing
me
beneath
his
hoary
brows
as
i
set
down
my
tankard
yes
said
i
well
think
o
that
now
i
been
to
lunnon

five
forty
year

did
but
i
never

how
was
that
i
inquired
why
theer
white
hart

sevenoaks

ale
at
white
hart
d
see
an
one
glass
begets
another
and
they
sent
ye
back
in
the
carrier
cart
said
the
fat
man
smiling
broader
than
ever
ever
see
the
lord
mayor
in
goold
coach
sir
pursued
the
old
man
yes
said
i
ever
speak
to
why
no
ah
well
i
once
knowed
a
man
as
spoke
to
the
lord
mayor
o
coachman
but
dead
took
the
smallpox
the
year
arterwards
died
did
at
this
juncture
the
door
was
thrown
noisily
open
and
two
gentlemen
entered
the
first
was
a
very
tall
man
with
black
hair
that
curled
beneath
his
and
so
luxuriant
a
growth
of
whisker
that
it
left
little
of
his
florid
countenance
exposed
the
second
was
more
slightly
built
with
a
pale
hairless
face
wherein
were
set
two
small
very
bright
eyes
rather
close
together
separated
by
a
high
thin
nose
with
nostrils
that
worked
and
quivered
when
he
spoke
a
face
whose
most
potent
feature
was
the
mouth
coarse
and
red
with
a
somewhat
protuberant
under
lip
yet
supported
by
a
square
determined
chin
below
a
sensual
mouth
with
more
than
a
suspicion
of
cruelty
lurking
in
its
full
curves
and
the
big
teeth
which
gleamed
white
and
serrated
when
he
laughed
indeed
the
whole
aspect
of
the
man
filled
me
with
an
instinctive
disgust
they
were
dressed
in
that
mixture
of
and
horsey
styles
peculiar
to
the
corinthian
or
buck
of
the
period
and
there
was
in
their
air
an
overbearing
yet
lazy
insolence
towards
all
and
sundry
that
greatly
annoyed
me
fifteen
thousand
a
year
by
gad
exclaimed
the
taller
of
the
two
giving
a
supercilious
sniff
to
the
brandy
he
had
just
poured
out
yes
ha
ha
and
a
damnably
pretty
filly
into
the
bargain
you
always
were
so
infernally
lucky
retorted
the
first
call
it
rather
the
reward
of
virtue
answered
his
companion
with
a
laugh
that
showed
his
big
white
teeth
and
what
of
beverley
poor
inquired
the
first
beverley
repeated
the
other
had
he
possessed
any
spirit
he
would
have
blown
his
brains
out
like
a
gentleman
as
it
was
he
preferred
merely
to
disappear
and
herewith
the
speaker
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
drank
off
his
glass
with
infinite
relish
and
gusto
and
a
pretty
filly
you
say
oh
i
believe
you
country
bred
but
devilish
trust
beverley
for
that
egad
yes
beverley
had
a
true
eye
for
beauty
or
breed
poor
this
expression
of
pity
seemed
to
afford
each
of
them
much
subtle
enjoyment
harking
back
to
this
filly
said
the
big
man
checking
his
merriment
how
if
she
jibs
and
cuts
up
rough
kicks
over
the
traces
devilish
awkward
eh
his
companion
raised
his
foot
and
rested
it
carelessly
upon
the
settle
near
by
and
upon
the
heel
of
his
slim
i
saw
a
particularly
spur
my
dear
mostyn
said
he
his
nostrils
working
for
such
an
emergency
there
is
nothing
like
a
pair
of
good
sharp
here
he
tapped
the
spur
lightly
with
the
slender
cane
he
carried
and
i
rather
fancy
i
know
just
how
and
when
to
use
mostyn
and
once
again
i
saw
the
gleam
of
his
big
white
teeth
all
this
i
heard
as
they
lolled
within
a
yard
of
me
manifesting
a
lofty
and
contemptuous
disregard
for
all
save
themselves
waited
upon
most
deferentially
by
the
smiling
fat
fellow
and
stared
at
by
the
aged
man
with
as
much
admiring
awe
as
if
they
had
each
been
nothing
less
than
a
lord
mayor
of
london
at
the
very
least
but
now
they
leaned
their
heads
together
and
spoke
in
lowered
tones
but
something
in
the
leering
eyes
of
the
one
and
the
smiling
lips
of
the
other
told
me
that
it
was
not
of
horses
that
they
spoke
bring
her
to
reason
by
gad
said
the
slighter
of
the
two
setting
down
his
empty
glass
with
a
bang
oh
trust
me
to
know
their
pretty
skittish
ways
trust
me
to
manage
i
never
failed
yet
by
gad
curse
me
that
true
enough
said
the
other
and
here
they
sank
their
voices
again
my
ale
being
finished
i
took
up
my
staff
a
heavy
knotted
affair
and
turned
to
go
now
as
i
did
so
my
foot
by
accident
came
in
contact
with
the
cane
i
have
mentioned
and
sent
it
clattering
to
the
floor
i
was
on
the
point
of
stooping
for
it
when
a
rough
hand
gripped
my
shoulder
from
behind
twisting
me
savagely
about
and
i
thus
found
myself
staring
upon
two
rows
of
sharp
white
teeth
pick
it
up
said
he
motioning
imperiously
to
the
cane
on
the
floor
between
us
heaven
forbid
sir
said
i
thy
servant
a
dog
that
he
should
do
this
thing
i
told
you
to
pick
it
up
he
repeated
thrusting
his
head
towards
me
are
you
going
to
do
so
or
must
i
make
you
and
his
nostrils
worked
more
than
ever
for
answer
i
raised
my
foot
and
sent
the
cane
spinning
across
the
room
somebody
laughed
and
next
moment
my
hat
was
knocked
from
my
head
before
he
could
strike
again
however
i
raised
my
staff
but
suddenly
remembering
its
formidable
weight
i
altered
the
direction
of
the
blow
and
thrust
it
strongly
into
the
very
middle
of
his
gayly
flowered
waistcoat
so
strongly
did
i
thrust
indeed
that
he
would
have
fallen
but
for
the
timely
assistance
of
his
companion
come
come
said
i
holding
him
off
on
the
end
of
my
staff
be
calm
now
and
let
us
reason
together
like
logical
beings
i
knocked
down
your
cane
by
accident
and
you
my
hat
by
intent
very
well
then
be
so
good
as
to
return
me
my
property
from
the
corner
yonder
and
we
will
call
no
by
gad
gasped
my
antagonist
bending
almost
double
wait
only
wait
until
i
get
my
wind
i
choke
the
infernal
life
out
of
you
only
wait
by
gad
willingly
said
i
but
whatever
else
you
do
you
will
certainly
reach
me
my
hat
otherwise
just
so
soon
as
you
find
yourself
sufficiently
recovered
i
shall
endeavor
to
throw
you
after
it
saying
which
i
laid
aside
my
staff
and
buttoned
up
my
coat
why
he
began
you
infernally
low
dusty
blackguard
but
his
companion
who
had
been
regarding
me
very
closely
twitched
him
by
the
sleeve
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
whatever
it
was
it
affected
my
antagonist
strangely
for
he
grew
suddenly
very
red
and
then
very
white
and
abruptly
turned
his
back
upon
me
are
you
sure
mostyn
said
he
in
an
undertone
certain
well
i
fight
him
were
he
the
devil
himself
pistols
perhaps
would
be
do
be
a
fool
harry
cried
the
other
and
seizing
his
arm
drew
him
farther
away
and
though
they
lowered
their
voices
i
caught
such
fragments
as
what
of
george
changes
since
your
time
ruin
your
chances
at
the
start
dead
shot
sir
said
i
my
hat
in
the
corner
yonder
almost
to
my
surprise
the
taller
of
the
two
crossed
the
room
followed
by
his
friend
to
whom
he
still
spoke
in
lowered
tones
stooped
picked
up
my
hat
and
while
the
other
stood
scowling
approached
and
handed
it
to
me
with
a
bow
that
my
friend
sir
harry
mortimer
lost
his
temper
is
regretted
both
by
him
and
myself
said
he
but
is
readily
explained
by
the
fact
that
he
has
been
a
long
time
from
london
while
i
labored
under
a
a
disadvantage
sir
until
your
hat
was
off
now
as
he
spoke
his
left
eyelid
flickered
twice
in
rapid
succession
i
beg
you
wo
mention
it
said
i
putting
on
my
hat
but
sir
why
do
you
wink
at
me
no
no
cried
he
laughing
and
shaking
his
head
ha
ha
deyvilish
good
by
the
way
they
tell
me
george
himself
is
in
these
parts
incog
of
course
george
said
i
staring
cursed
rich
on
my
life
and
soul
cried
the
tall
gentleman
shaking
his
head
and
laughing
again
mum
the
word
of
course
and
i
swear
a
shaven
face
becomes
you
most
deyvilishly
perhaps
you
will
be
so
obliging
as
to
tell
me
what
you
mean
said
i
frowning
oh
by
gad
he
cried
fairly
hugging
himself
with
delight
oh
the
devil
this
is
too
rich
too
infernally
rich
on
my
life
and
soul
it
is
now
all
at
once
there
recurred
to
me
the
memory
of
tom
cragg
the
pugilist
of
how
he
too
had
winked
at
me
and
of
his
incomprehensible
manner
afterwards
beneath
the
gibbet
on
river
hill
sir
said
i
do
you
happen
to
know
a
pugilist
tom
cragg
by
name
tom
cragg
well
i
should
think
so
who
does
sir
because
i
went
on
he
too
seems
to
labor
under
the
delusion
that
he
is
acquainted
with
me
and
acquainted
repeated
the
tall
gentleman
acquainted
oh
gad
and
immediately
hugged
himself
in
another
ecstasy
if
said
i
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
for
whom
you
evidently
mistake
me
mistake
you
he
gasped
throwing
himself
upon
the
settle
and
rocking
to
and
fro
ha
ha
mistake
you
seeing
i
did
but
waste
my
breath
i
turned
upon
my
heel
and
made
for
the
door
as
i
went
my
eye
by
chance
lighted
upon
a
cheese
that
stood
at
the
fat
landlord
elbow
and
upon
which
he
cast
amorous
glances
from
time
to
time
that
seems
a
fine
cheese
said
i
it
is
sir
if
i
might
make
so
bold
a
noble
cheese
he
rejoined
and
laid
his
hand
upon
it
with
a
touch
that
was
a
caress
then
i
will
take
three
pennyworth
of
your
noble
cheese
said
i
cheese
faintly
echoed
the
gentleman
upon
the
settle
three
pennyworth
oh
i
shall
die
positively
i
shall
burst
also
a
loaf
said
i
and
when
the
landlord
had
cut
the
cheese
with
great
nicety
a
generous
portion
and
had
wrapped
it
into
a
parcel
i
put
it
together
with
the
loaf
into
my
knapsack
and
giving
him
good
day
strode
to
the
door
as
i
reached
it
the
tall
gentleman
rose
from
the
settle
and
bowed
referring
to
george
sir
george
said
i
shortly
to
the
devil
with
george
now
i
could
not
help
being
struck
by
the
effect
of
my
words
for
sir
harry
let
fall
his
cane
and
stared
while
his
companion
regarded
me
with
an
expression
between
a
frown
and
dismay
now
i
wonder
said
i
to
myself
as
i
descended
the
steps
i
wonder
who
george
can
be
before
the
inn
there
stood
a
stanhope
with
a
horse
which
from
his
manner
of
trembling
all
over
for
no
conceivable
reason
and
manifest
desire
to
stand
upon
his
hind
legs
i
conceived
to
be
a
and
hanging
grimly
to
the
bridle
now
in
the
air
now
on
terra
firma
alternately
coaxing
and
cursing
was
my
friend
the
ostler
he
caught
sight
of
me
just
as
a
particularly
vicious
jerk
swung
him
off
his
legs
damn
your
liver
he
cried
to
the
horse
and
then
to
me
if
jest
call
joe
to
this
black
varmin
for
me
i
fill
yer
eye
up
thanks
said
i
but
i
much
prefer
to
keep
it
as
it
is
really
there
is
no
need
to
trouble
joe
and
as
for
you
i
wish
you
good
morning
and
when
i
had
gone
a
little
way
chancing
to
glance
back
over
my
shoulder
i
saw
that
the
outside
passenger
stood
upon
the
inn
steps
and
was
staring
after
me
chapter
xii
the
soldier
following
the
high
road
i
came
in
a
little
to
where
the
ways
divided
the
one
leading
straight
before
me
the
other
turning
sharp
to
the
left
where
as
i
remember
is
a
very
steep
hill
and
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
was
a
with
the
words
to
london
to
tonbridge
wells
to
pembry
now
as
i
stood
beneath
the
debating
which
road
i
should
take
i
was
aware
of
the
sound
of
wheels
and
glancing
about
saw
a
carrier
cart
approaching
the
driver
was
a
fine
tall
fellow
very
spruce
as
to
his
person
who
held
himself
with
shoulders
squared
and
bolt
upright
and
who
shouted
a
cheery
greeting
to
me
if
so
be
you
are
for
pembry
or
thereabouts
sir
said
he
bringing
his
horses
to
a
standstill
why
jump
up
sir
that
is
if
you
be
so
minded
my
course
lies
anywhere
said
i
then
if
you
be
so
minded
i
am
so
minded
said
i
then
sir
jump
up
said
he
thanks
said
i
so
i
climbed
upon
the
seat
beside
him
and
then
i
saw
that
he
had
a
wooden
leg
and
straightway
understood
his
smart
bearing
and
general
neat
appearance
you
have
been
a
soldier
said
i
and
my
name
tom
and
i
could
tell
you
a
sight
about
them
spanishers
and
frenchies
that
is
if
you
be
so
minded
i
am
so
minded
fire
away
tom
well
he
began
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
wheeler
ears
they
frenchies
ai
so
bad
as
is
thought
though
they
do
eat
frogs
but
what
i
say
is
if
they
be
so
minded
why
frogs
let
it
be
to
be
sure
said
i
and
after
all
they
well
worth
fighting
and
that
more
than
you
can
say
for
a
many
true
said
i
one
generally

a
certain
respect
for
the
man

i
say
he
were
trying
to
tell
me
to
drop
him
and
run
for
it
and
blowing
wi
every
word
when
all
at
once
i
feels
a
sort
of
a
shock
and
there
i
was
on
my
back
and
him
atop
o
me
and
when
i
went
to
get
up
damme
there
was
my
leg
gone
below
the
knee
and
no
pleasant
sight
neither
and
afterward
arterwards
he
repeated
why
that
were
the
end
o
my
sojerin
ye
see
we
lay
in
the
same
an
me
side
by
side
and
he
swore
as
i
saved
his
life
which
i
look
you
and
likewise
swore
as
he
never
forget
it
and
he
never
either
for
here
am
i
wi
my
own
horse
and
cart
tom
price
by
name
carrier
by
trade
an
very
much
at
your
service
sir
i
sure
thus
we
climbed
the
hill
of
pembry
by
tree
and
hedge
and
lonely
cottage
by
rolling
meadow
and
twilit
wood
tom
the
soldier
and
i
much
he
told
me
of
lonely
night
watches
of
death
sudden
and
sharp
of
long
weary
marches
and
stricken
fields
of
the
bloody
doings
of
the
spanish
guerrillas
of
mina
and
his
deviltries
and
in
my
ears
was
the
roar
of
guns
and
before
my
eyes
the
gleam
and
twinkle
of
bayonets
by
the
side
of
tom
the
soldier
i
waited
the
thunderous
charge
of
french
dragoons
saw
their
stern
set
faces
and
the
flash
of
their
brandished
steel
as
they
swept
down
upon
our
devoted
square
swept
down
to
break
in
red
confusion
before
our
bristling
bayonets
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
screams
of
smitten
horses
and
the
shouts
and
groans
of
men
by
the
side
of
tom
the
soldier
i
stormed
through
many
a
reeking
breach
swept
by
fire
and
slippery
with
blood
and
all
for
love
of
it
the
munificent
sum
of
eightpence
per
day
and
that
which
we
call
glory
bravo
tom
the
soldier
and
presently
i
became
aware
that
he
had
stopped
his
horses
and
was
regarding
me
smilingly
tom
said
i
you
are
a
wonderful
talker
and
you
sir
said
he
are
a
better
listener
and
look
you
a
good
listener
is
mighty
hard
to
come
by
howsomever
here
the
end
o
my
journey
more
the
pity
but
if
you
tom
said
i
suddenly
you
never
heard
of
tom
cragg
did
you
ca
say
as
i
have
he
answered
stroking
his
chin
thoughtfully
though
there
was
a
dick
snagget
in
the
i
remember
and
you
do
know
who
is
of
course
i
continued
musingly
why
i
knowed
a
many
georges
in
my
time
said
he
and
then
there
george
prince
o
wales
the
prince
regent
as
they
calls
him
now
george
prince
of
wales
said
i
staring
by
heavens
tom
i
believe
you
hit
it
and
with
the
word
i
sprang
down
from
the
cart
my
cottage
is
near
by
sir
and
i
should
be
proud
for
you
to
eat
supper
wi
me
that
is
if
you
be
so
minded
many
thanks
said
i
but
i
am
not
so
minded
and
so
tom
and
with
the
words
i
wrung
the
soldier
honest
hand
in
mine
and
went
upon
my
way
george
prince
of
wales
said
i
to
myself
could
this
be
the
they
had
meant
if
so
then
who
and
what
had
they
supposed
me
hereupon
as
i
walked
i
fell
into
a
profound
meditation
in
which
i
presently
remembered
how
that
tom
cragg
had
also
mentioned
the
prince
giving
me
to
understand
that
his
highness
had
actually
ordered
him
tom
cragg
to
leave
london
and
why
arter
that
theer
kidnappin
an
me
laid
out
sir
jarsper
trent
accordin
to
yer
order
sir
jasper
trent
i
stopped
stock
still
in
the
road
sir
jasper
trent
at
last
i
remembered
the
name
that
had
eluded
me
so
persistently
remembered
it
nay
indeed
it
was
rather
as
if
the
pugilist
had
whispered
the
words
into
my
ear
and
i
glanced
round
almost
expecting
to
see
him
arter
that
theer
kidnappin
an
me
laid
out
sir
jarsper
trent
accordin
to
yer
orders
according
to
my
orders
or
rather
the
orders
of
the
man
for
whom
he
in
common
with
the
two
gentlemen
at
the
chequers
had
mistaken
me
but
who
was
that
man
of
him
i
knew
two
facts
namely
that
he
was
much
like
me
in
person
and
had
formerly
worn
or
possibly
still
wore
whiskers
and
beyond
these
two
facts
i
could
get
no
farther
revolve
the
matter
how
i
might
so
i
presently
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
banishing
it
from
my
thoughts
for
the
time
being
set
forward
at
a
good
pace
chapter
xiii
in
which
i
find
an
answer
to
my
riddle
the
sun
was
already
westering
when
i
came
to
a
pump
beside
the
way
and
seizing
the
handle
i
worked
it
vigorously
then
placing
my
hollowed
hands
beneath
the
gushing
spout
drank
and
pumped
alternately
until
i
had
quenched
my
thirst
i
now
found
myself
prodigiously
hungry
and
remembering
the
bread
and
cheese
in
my
knapsack
looked
about
for
an
inviting
spot
in
which
to
eat
on
one
side
of
the
road
was
a
thick
hedge
and
beneath
this
hedge
a
deep
dry
grassy
ditch
and
here
after
first
slipping
off
my
knapsack
i
sat
down
took
out
the
loaf
and
the
cheese
and
opening
my
prepared
to
fall
to
at
this
moment
i
was
interrupted
in
a
rather
singular
fashion
for
hearing
a
rustling
close
by
i
looked
up
and
into
a
face
that
was
protruded
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
above
me
it
needed
but
a
glance
at
the
battered
hat
with
its
jaunty
brim
and
great
silver
buckle
and
the
haggard
face
below
to
recognize
the
individual
whom
i
had
seen
thrown
out
of
the
hedge
tavern
the
morning
before
it
was
a
very
thin
face
as
i
have
said
pale
and
and
framed
in
black
curly
hair
whose
very
blackness
did
but
accentuate
the
extreme
pallor
of
the
skin
which
was
tight
and
drawn
above
the
cheek
bones
and
angle
of
the
jaw
yet
as
i
looked
at
this
face
worn
and
cadaverous
though
it
was
in
the
glance
of
the
hollow
eyes
in
the
line
of
the
mouth
i
saw
that
mysterious
something
which
marks
a
man
what
we
call
for
want
of
a
better
word
a
gentleman
good
evening
said
he
and
lifted
the
battered
hat
good
evening
i
returned
pardon
me
said
he
but
i
was
saluting
the
bread
and
cheese
indeed
said
i
indeed
he
rejoined
it
is
the
first
edible
i
have
been
on
speaking
terms
with
so
to
speak
for
rather
more
than
three
days
sir
you
are
probably
hungry
said
i
it
would
be
foolish
to
deny
it
sir
then
if
you
care
to
eat
with
me
in
the
ditch
here
you
are
heartily
welcome
said
i
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
said
he
vaulting
very
nimbly
through
the
hedge
you
shall
not
ask
me
twice
or
the
very
deuce
is
in
it
believe
me
i
here
he
stopped
very
suddenly
and
stood
looking
at
me
ah
said
he
gently
and
with
a
rising
inflection
letting
the
ejaculation
escape
in
a
breath
well
i
inquired
now
as
i
looked
up
at
him
the
whole
aspect
of
the
man
from
the
toes
of
his
broken
boots
to
the
crown
of
the
battered
hat
seemed
to
undergo
a
change
as
though
a
sudden
fierce
anger
had
leapt
into
life
and
been
controlled
but
by
a
strong
effort
on
my
life
and
soul
now
said
he
falling
back
a
step
and
eyeing
me
with
a
vaguely
unpleasant
smile
this
is
a
most
unexpected
a
most
unlooked
for
pleasure
it
is
i
vow
it
is
you
flatter
me
said
i
no
sir
no
to
meet
you
again
some
day
somewhere
alone
quite
alone
sir
is
a
pleasure
i
have
frequently
dwelt
upon
but
never
hoped
to
realize
as
it
is
sir
having
in
my
present
condition
no
chance
of
procuring
better
weapons
than
my
fists
allow
me
to
suggest
that
they
are
none
the
less
entirely
at
your
service
do
me
the
infinite
kindness
to
stand
up
sir
i
answered
cutting
a
slice
from
the
loaf
you
are
the
third
person
within
the
last
hours
who
has
mistaken
me
for
another
it
really
gets
quite
wearisome
mistaken
you
he
broke
in
and
his
smile
grew
suddenly
bitter
do
you
think
it
possible
that
i
could
ever
mistake
you
i
am
sure
of
it
said
i
furthermore
pray
do
not
disparage
your
fists
sir
a
bout
at
fisticuffs
never
did
a
man
any
harm
that
i
ever
heard
a
man
fists
are
good
honest
weapons
supplied
by
a
beneficent
providence
far
better
than
your
unnatural
swords
and
murderous
at
least
so
i
think
being
i
trust
something
of
a
philosopher
still
in
this
instance
never
having
seen
your
face
or
heard
your
voice
until
yesterday
i
shall
continue
to
sit
here
and
eat
my
bread
and
cheese
and
if
you
are
wise
you
will
hasten
to
follow
my
so
excellent
example
while
there
is
any
left
for
i
warn
you
i
am
mightily
sharp
set
come
come
said
he
advancing
upon
me
threateningly
enough
of
this
foolery
by
all
means
said
i
sit
down
like
a
sensible
fellow
and
tell
me
for
whom
you
mistake
me
sir
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
said
he
clenching
his
fists
and
i
saw
his
nostrils
dilate
suddenly
i
take
you
for
the
greatest
rogue
the
most
gentlemanly
rascal
but
one
in
all
england
yes
said
i
and
my
name
sir
maurice
vibart
sir
maurice
vibart
i
sprang
to
my
feet
staring
at
him
in
amazement
sir
maurice
vibart
is
my
cousin
said
i
and
so
we
stood
for
a
long
minute
immobile
and
silent
eyeing
each
other
above
the
bread
and
cheese
chapter
xiv
further
concerning
the
gentleman
in
the
battered
hat
sir
said
my
companion
at
last
lifting
the
battered
hat
i
tender
you
my
apology
and
i
shall
be
delighted
to
eat
with
you
in
the
ditch
if
you
are
in
the
same
mind
about
it
then
you
believe
me
indubitably
sir
he
answered
with
a
faint
smile
had
you
indeed
been
sir
maurice
either
he
or
i
and
most
probably
i
would
be
lying
flat
in
the
road
by
this
so
without
more
ado
we
sat
down
in
the
ditch
together
side
by
side
and
began
to
eat
and
now
i
noticed
that
when
he
thought
my
eye
was
upon
him
my
companion
ate
with
a
due
deliberation
and
nicety
and
when
he
thought
it
was
off
with
a
voracity
that
was
painful
to
witness
and
after
we
had
eaten
a
while
in
silence
he
turned
to
me
with
a
sigh
this
is
very
excellent
cheese
said
he
the
man
from
whom
i
bought
it
said
i
called
it
a
noble
cheese
i
remember
i
never
tasted
one
of
a
finer
flavor
said
my
companion
hunger
is
a
fine
sauce
said
i
and
you
are
probably
hungry
hungry
he
repeated
bolting
a
mouthful
and
knocking
his
hat
over
his
eyes
with
a
slap
on
its
dusty
crown
egad
vibart
so
would
you
be
so
would
any
man
be
who
has
lived
on
anything
he
could
beg
borrow
or
steal
with
an
occasional
meal
of
turnips
in
the
digging
of
which
i
am
become
astonishingly
expert
and
unripe
blackberries
which
latter
i
have
proved
to
be
a
very
trying
diet
in
many
ways
hungry
oh
damme
and
after
a
while
when
there
nothing
remained
of
loaf
or
cheese
save
a
few
scattered
crumbs
my
companion
leaned
back
and
gave
another
sigh
sir
said
he
with
an
airy
wave
of
the
hand
in
me
you
behold
a
highly
promising
young
gentleman
ruined
by
a
most
implacable
enemy
himself
sir
in
the
first
place
you
must
know
my
name
is
beverley
beverley
i
repeated
beverley
he
nodded
peregrine
beverley
very
much
at
your
service
late
of
beverley
place
surrey
now
of
beverley
said
i
again
i
have
heard
that
name
before
it
is
highly
probable
vibart
a
fool
of
that
name
fortunate
or
unfortunate
as
you
choose
to
classify
him
lost
houses
land
and
money
in
a
single
night
play
i
am
that
fool
sir
though
you
have
doubtless
heard
particulars
ere
now
not
a
word
said
beverley
glanced
at
me
with
a
faint
mingling
of
pity
and
surprise
my
life
i
explained
has
been
altogether
a
studious
one
with
the
not
altogether
unnatural
result
that
i
also
am
bound
for
with
just
eight
shillings
and
sixpence
in
my
pocket
and
mine
as
i
tell
you
said
he
has
been
an
altogether
riotous
one
thus
each
of
us
though
by
widely
separate
roads
you
by
the
narrow
and
difficult
path
of
virtue
and
i
by
the
broad
and
easy
road
of
folly
have
managed
to
find
our
way
into
this
howling
destitution
which
we
will
call
then
how
does
your
path
of
virtue
better
my
road
of
evil
the
point
to
be
considered
said
i
is
not
so
much
what
we
now
are
but
rather
what
we
have
done
and
may
ultimately
be
and
do
well
said
he
turning
to
look
at
me
for
my
own
achievements
hitherto
i
continued
i
have
won
the
high
jump
and
throwing
the
hammer
also
translated
the
works
of
quintilian
with
the
satyricon
of
petronius
arbiter
and
the
life
lives
and
memoirs
of
the
seigneur
de
brantome
which
last
as
you
are
probably
aware
has
never
before
been
done
into
the
english
ha
exclaimed
beverley
sitting
up
suddenly
with
his
hat
very
much
over
one
eye
there
we
have
it
whoever
heard
of
old
quin
or
cared
except
perhaps
a
few
bookworms
and
withered
litterateurs
while
you
were
dreaming
of
life
and
reading
the
lives
of
other
fellows
i
was
living
it
in
my
career
episodically
brief
though
it
was
i
have
met
and
talked
with
all
the
wits
and
celebrated
men
have
drunk
good
wine
and
worshipped
beautiful
women
mr
vibart
and
what
has
it
all
taught
you
said
i
that
there
are
an
infernal
number
of
rogues
and
rascals
in
the
world
for
one
thing
and
that
is
worth
knowing
yes
said
i
that
though
money
can
buy
anything
from
the
love
of
a
woman
to
the
death
of
an
enemy
it
can
only
be
spent
once
and
that
is
worth
knowing
also
yes
said
i
and
that
i
am
a
most
preposterous
ass
and
that
last
look
you
is
more
valuable
than
all
the
others
solomon
i
think
says
something
about
a
wise
man
being
truly
wise
who
knoweth
himself
a
fool
he
something
of
the
sort
then
said
he
flinging
his
hat
down
upon
the
grass
beside
him
what
argument
can
you
advance
in
favor
of
your
and
thorny
the
sum
of
eight
shillings
and
sixpence
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
slice
of
noble
cheese
now
no
more
said
i
egad
said
he
looking
at
me
from
the
corners
of
his
blue
eyes
the
argument
is
unanswerable
more
especially
the
cheese
part
against
which
i
say
nothing
even
if
i
could
having
remarked
which
he
lay
flat
on
his
back
again
staring
up
at
the
leaves
and
the
calm
serenity
of
the
sky
beyond
while
i
filled
my
pipe
from
my
paper
of
tobacco
and
forthwith
began
to
smoke
and
presently
as
i
sat
alternately
watching
the
blue
wreaths
of
my
pipe
and
the
bedraggled
figure
extended
beside
me
he
suddenly
rolled
over
on
his
arm
and
so
lay
watching
me
on
my
soul
he
exclaimed
at
length
it
is
positively
marvellous
what
is
i
inquired
the
resemblance
between
you
and
your
famous
cousin
it
would
appear
so
said
i
shrugging
my
shoulders
though
personally
i
was
unaware
of
this
fact
up
till
now
do
i
understand
that
you
have
never
seen
sir
maurice
vibart
never
seen
vibart
never
said
i
too
much
occupied
in
keeping
to
the
narrow
and
thorny
i
suppose
your
cousin
is
the
broad
and
flowery
with
a
vengeance
so
i
understand
said
i
nevertheless
the
resemblance
between
you
both
in
face
and
figure
is
positively
astounding
with
the
sole
exception
that
he
wears
hair
upon
his
face
and
is
of
a
ruddy
complexion
while
you
are
pale
and
smooth
as
as
a
boy
or
yourself
said
i
ah
exactly
he
answered
and
passed
his
fingers
across
his
chin
tentatively
and
fell
again
to
staring
lazily
up
into
the
sky
do
you
happen
to
know
anything
about
that
most
remarkable
species
of
the
homo
calling
themselves
or
he
inquired
after
a
while
very
little
said
i
and
that
only
by
hearsay
well
up
to
six
months
ago
i
was
one
of
them
vibart
until
fortune
and
i
think
now
wisely
decreed
it
otherwise
and
herewith
lying
upon
his
back
looking
up
through
the
quivering
green
of
leaves
he
told
mad
tales
of
a
reckless
prince
of
the
placid
brummel
of
the
dashing
vibart
the
brilliant
sheridan
of
fox
and
grattan
and
many
others
whose
names
are
now
a
byword
one
way
or
the
other
he
recounted
a
story
of
wild
prodigality
of
drunken
midnight
orgies
of
days
and
nights
over
the
cards
of
wine
women
and
horses
but
lastly
and
very
reverently
he
spoke
of
a
woman
of
her
love
and
faith
and
deathless
trust
of
course
he
ended
i
might
have
starved
very
comfortably
and
much
quicker
in
london
but
when
my
time
comes
i
prefer
to
do
my
dying
beneath
some
green
hedge
or
in
the
shelter
of
some
friendly
rick
with
the
cool
clean
wind
upon
my
face
besides
she
loved
the
country
then
there
are
some
women
who
ca
be
bought
said
i
looking
at
his
glistening
eyes
vibart
said
he
so
far
as
i
know
there
are
two
the
lady
helen
dunstan
and
the
sefton
the
lady
sophia
sefton
of
cambourne
said
i
and
the
lady
helen
dunstan
he
repeated
do
you
know
the
lady
sophia
sefton
i
have
had
the
honor
of
dancing
with
her
frequently
he
answered
and
is
she
so
beautiful
as
they
say
she
is
the
handsomest
woman
in
london
one
of
your
goddesses
tall
and
gracious
and
most
nobly
shaped
though
sir
for
my
own
part
i
prefer
less
fire
and
ice
and
more
gentle
beauty
as
for
instance
the
lady
helen
dunstan
said
i
exactly
nodded
beverley
referring
to
the
lady
sophia
sefton
i
pursued
she
is
a
reigning
toast
i
believe
gad
yes
her
worshippers
are
legion
and
chief
among
them
his
royal
highness
and
your
cousin
sir
maurice
who
has
actually
had
the
temerity
to
enter
the
field
as
the
prince
avowed
rival
no
one
but
vibart
could
be
so
madly
rash
a
most
fortunate
lady
said
i
mr
vibart
exclaimed
my
companion
cocking
his
battered
hat
and
regarding
me
with
a
smouldering
eye
vibart
i
object
to
your
tone
the
noble
sefton
virtue
is
proud
and
high
and
above
even
the
breath
of
suspicion
and
yet
my
cousin
would
seem
to
be
no
laggard
in
love
and
as
to
the
prince
his
glance
is
contamination
to
a
woman
sir
returned
beverley
very
earnestly
disabuse
your
mind
of
all
unworthy
suspicions
i
beg
your
cousin
she
laughs
to
scorn
and
his
royal
highness
she
had
rebuffed
as
few
women
have
hitherto
dared
do
it
would
almost
seem
said
i
after
a
pause
that
from
what
i
have
inadvertently
learned
my
cousin
has
some
dirty
work
afoot
though
exactly
what
i
can
not
imagine
my
dear
vibart
your
excellent
cousin
is
forever
up
to
something
or
other
and
has
escaped
the
consequences
more
than
once
owing
to
his
friendship
with
and
the
favor
of
his
friend
george
said
i
exactly
said
my
companion
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
and
nodding
george
have
you
ever
heard
mention
of
tom
cragg
the
pugilist
i
inquired
blowing
a
cloud
of
smoke
into
the
warm
air
i
won
ten
thousand
guineas
when
he
knocked
out
ted
jarraway
of
swansea
yawned
my
companion
a
good
fighter
but
a
rogue
like
all
the
rest
of
and
a
creature
of
your
excellent
cousin
i
guessed
as
much
i
nodded
and
forthwith
plunged
into
an
account
of
my
meeting
with
the
craggy
one
the
which
seemed
to
amuse
beverley
mightily
more
especially
when
i
related
cragg
mysterious
disappearance
oh
gad
cried
beverley
wiping
his
eyes
on
the
tattered
lapel
of
his
coat
the
resemblance
served
you
luckily
there
your
cousin
gave
him
the
thrashing
of
his
life
and
poor
tom
evidently
thought
he
was
in
for
another
that
was
the
last
you
saw
of
him
i
be
bound
no
i
met
him
afterwards
beneath
the
gibbet
on
river
hill
where
among
other
incomprehensible
things
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
recognized
me
despite
my
disguise
assumed
as
he
supposed
on
account
of
his
having
kidnapped
some
one
or
other
and
out
a
certain
sir
jasper
trent
in
wych
street
according
to
my
orders
or
rather
it
would
seem
my
cousin
orders
the
author
of
which
outrage
sir
jasper
had
evidently
found
out
the
devil
exclaimed
beverley
and
sat
up
with
a
jerk
and
furthermore
i
went
on
he
informed
me
that
the
prince
himself
had
given
him
the
word
to
leave
london
until
the
affair
had
blown
over
now
while
i
spoke
beverley
had
been
regarding
me
with
a
very
strange
expression
his
cheeks
had
gone
even
paler
than
before
his
eyes
seemed
to
stare
through
and
beyond
me
and
his
hands
were
at
his
sides
beverley
said
i
what
ails
you
for
a
moment
he
did
not
speak
then
answered
with
the
same
strange
look
sir
jasper
trent
is
my
cousin
sir
my
pipe
slipped
suddenly
and
fell
into
the
grass
happily
without
injury
indeed
said
i
can
you
not
see
what
this
means
sir
he
went
on
hurriedly
jasper
will
fight
indeed
said
i
again
i
fear
so
jasper
was
always
a
bit
of
a
fish
and
with
no
particular
affection
for
his
graceless
kinsman
but
i
am
his
only
relative
and
and
he
hardly
knows
one
end
of
a
pistol
from
the
other
while
your
cousin
is
a
dead
shot
my
cousin
i
exclaimed
then
it
was
he
to
be
sure
i
saw
only
his
back
sir
jasper
is
unmarried
has
no
relations
but
myself
my
companion
repeated
with
the
same
fixed
intentness
of
look
can
you
appreciate
i
wonder
what
this
would
mean
to
me
rank
and
fortune
and
london
said
i
no
no
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
threw
wide
his
ragged
arms
with
a
swift
passionate
gesture
it
means
life
and
helen
my
god
he
went
on
speaking
almost
in
a
whisper
i
never
knew
how
much
i
wanted
her
how
much
i
had
wilfully
tossed
aside
till
now
i
never
realized
the
full
misery
of
it
all
till
now
i
could
have
starved
very
well
in
time
and
managed
it
as
quietly
as
most
other
ruined
fools
but
now
to
see
the
chance
of
beginning
again
of
coming
back
to
and
helen
my
god
and
of
a
sudden
he
cast
himself
upon
his
face
and
so
lay
tearing
up
the
grass
by
handfuls
then
almost
as
suddenly
he
was
upon
his
feet
again
and
had
caught
up
his
hat
sir
said
he
somewhat
shamefacedly
smoothing
its
ruffled
nap
with
fingers
that
still
quivered
pray
forgive
that
little
ebullition
of
feeling
it
is
over
quite
over
but
your
tidings
affected
me
and
i
am
not
quite
myself
at
times
as
i
have
already
said
turnips
and
unripe
blackberries
are
not
altogether
desirable
as
a
diet
indeed
said
i
you
seemed
strangely
perturbed
vibart
said
he
staring
very
hard
at
the
battered
hat
and
turning
it
round
and
round
vibart
the
devil
is
surprisingly
strong
in
some
of
us
true
said
i
my
cousin
sir
jasper
is
a
bookish
fellow
and
as
i
have
said
a
fool
where
anything
else
is
in
question
if
this
meeting
is
allowed
to
take
place
i
feel
that
he
will
most
certainly
be
killed
and
his
death
would
mean
a
new
life
more
than
life
to
me
yes
said
i
and
for
a
moment
vibart
i
was
tempted
to
sit
down
in
the
ditch
again
and
let
things
take
their
course
the
devil
i
repeat
is
remarkably
strong
in
some
of
us
then
what
is
your
present
intention
i
am
going
to
london
to
find
sir
maurice
vibart
to
stop
this
duel
impossible
said
i
but
you
see
sir
it
so
happens
that
i
am
possessed
of
certain
intelligence
which
might
make
sir
maurice
existence
in
england
positively
untenable
nevertheless
said
i
it
is
impossible
that
remains
to
be
seen
vibart
said
he
and
speaking
turned
upon
his
heel
one
moment
said
i
was
not
your
cousin
sir
jasper
of
the
middle
height
and
with
a
habit
of
plucking
at
his
lips
when
at
all
nervous
or
excited
exactly
you
know
him
sir
no
i
answered
but
i
have
seen
him
very
lately
and
i
say
again
to
stop
this
duel
is
an
impossibility
do
you
mean
he
began
and
paused
now
as
his
eyes
met
mine
the
battered
hat
escaped
his
fingers
and
lay
all
unheeded
do
you
mean
he
began
again
and
again
stopped
yes
said
i
i
mean
that
you
are
too
late
sir
jasper
was
killed
at
a
place
called
deepdene
wood
no
longer
since
than
at
seven
in
the
morning
it
was
raining
at
the
time
i
remember
but
the
day
grew
glorious
later
for
a
long
moment
beverley
stood
silent
with
bent
head
then
apparently
becoming
aware
of
the
hat
at
his
feet
he
sent
it
flying
with
a
sudden
kick
and
watched
it
describe
a
wide
parabola
ere
it
disappeared
into
the
ditch
some
yards
away
which
done
he
walked
after
it
and
returned
brushing
it
very
carefully
with
his
ragged
cuff
and
you
are
sure
quite
sure
mr
vibart
he
inquired
smoothing
the
broken
brim
with
the
greatest
solicitude
i
stood
behind
a
hedge
and
watched
it
done
said
i
then
my
god
i
am
sir
peregrine
beverley
i
am
sir
peregrine
beverley
of
burnham
hall
very
much
at
your
service
jasper
dead
a
knight
banneret
of
kent
and
justice
of
the
peace
how
utterly
preposterous
it
all
sounds
but
i
begin
life
anew
ah
yes
a
new
life
a
new
life
all
things
are
possible
again
the
fool
has
learned
wisdom
and
i
hope
become
a
man
but
come
said
he
in
a
more
natural
tone
let
us
get
back
to
our
ditch
and
while
you
tell
me
the
particulars
if
you
do
object
i
should
much
like
to
try
a
whiff
at
that
pipe
of
yours
so
while
i
recounted
the
affair
as
briefly
as
i
might
he
sat
puffing
at
my
pipe
and
staring
away
into
the
distance
but
gradually
his
head
sank
lower
and
lower
until
his
face
was
quite
hidden
from
me
and
for
a
long
moment
after
i
had
ended
my
narration
there
was
silence
poor
jasper
said
he
at
last
without
raising
his
head
poor
old
jasper
i
congratulate
you
sir
peregrine
said
i
and
i
used
to
pummel
him
so
when
we
were
boys
together
at
eton
poor
old
jasper
and
presently
he
handed
me
my
pipe
and
rose
vibart
said
he
it
would
seem
that
by
no
effort
or
virtue
of
my
own
i
am
to
win
free
of
this
howling
desolation
of
after
all
believe
me
i
would
gladly
take
you
with
me
had
i
not
met
with
you
it
is
rather
more
than
probable
that
i
should
never
have
seen
another
dawn
so
if
if
ever
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
pray
honor
me
so
far
you
can
always
hear
of
me
at
burnham
hall
pembry
vibart
i
am
going
to
her
in
all
my
rags
for
i
am
a
man
again
so
i
bade
him
and
sitting
in
the
ditch
watched
him
stride
away
to
his
new
life
presently
reaching
the
brow
of
the
hill
there
are
hills
everywhere
in
the
south
country
i
saw
him
turn
to
flourish
the
battered
hat
ere
he
disappeared
from
my
sight
chapter
xv
in
which
i
meet
with
a
pedler
by
the
name
of
gabbing
dick
you
wo
be
wantin
ever
a
broom
now
i
sat
up
sleepily
and
rubbed
my
eyes
the
sun
was
gone
and
the
blue
sky
had
changed
to
a
deep
purple
set
here
and
there
with
a
quivering
star
yet
the
light
was
still
strong
enough
to
enable
me
to
distinguish
the
speaker
a
short
man
upon
his
shoulder
he
carried
a
bundle
of
brooms
a
pack
was
slung
to
his
back
while
round
his
neck
there
dangled
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
articles
ribbons
laces
tawdry
neck
chains
and
the
like
indeed
so
smothered
was
he
in
his
wares
that
as
he
stood
there
he
had
more
the
aspect
of
some
disordered
fancy
than
of
a
human
being
you
wo
be
wantin
ever
a
broom
now
he
repeated
in
a
somewhat
melancholy
tone
no
said
i
nor
yet
a
mop
nor
that
either
said
i
a
belt
now
he
suggested
mournfully
a
fine
leather
belt
wi
a
steel
buckle
made
in
brummagem
as
ever
was
and
all
for
a
shillin
what
d
say
to
a
fine
belt
that
i
have
no
need
of
one
thank
you
ah
well
said
the
man
spitting
dejectedly
at
a
patch
of
shadow
i
thought
as
much
you
are
got
the
look
of
a
buyer
then
why
ask
me
hinstinct
said
he
it
jest
hinstinct
it
comes
as
to
me
as
eatin
or
walkin
these
roads
have
you
come
far
twenty
mile
maybe
he
answered
setting
down
his
bundle
of
brooms
are
you
tired
i
tired
then
why
not
sit
down
and
rest
because
i
to
get
up
again
would
i
are
you
hungry
are
the
word
for
it
and
how
is
trade
could
be
worse
i
perceive
you
are
a
pessimist
said
i
no
said
he
i
a
pedler
name
richard
commonly
known
as
dick
at
least
yours
is
a
fine
healthy
trade
said
i
so
a
life
of
constant
exercise
and
fresh
air
for
instance
as
a
hoven
said
he
yet
there
was
a
good
cool
wind
said
i
ah
an
with
dust
enough
to
choke
a
man
and
then
there
the
loneliness
o
these
roads
loneliness
said
i
that
the
word
sometimes
it
gets
so
bad
as
i
minded
to
do
away
myself
strange
i
began
not
a
bit
said
he
when
you

an
all

but
worse
when

o

said
goin
up
to

i
got
down
on
my
and
knees
and
strikin
a
light

there

poor
bill
nye
hunched
up
inside
of
it
wi
a
razor
in
and
nigh
cut
off
and
what

one
thing

another
a
very
unpleasant
sight

were
and
why
why
did
he
do
it

asked

o
course
it
jest
the
loneliness
they
find

some
day

i
never

danglin
to
the
thing
as
looks
like
a
oak
tree
in
the
daytime
what
do
you
mean
said
i
the
pedler
sighed
shook
his
head
and
shouldered
his
brooms
it
jest
the
loneliness
said
he
and
spitting
over
this
shoulder
trudged
upon
his
way
chapter
xvi
how
i
heard
the
steps
of
one
who
dogged
me
in
the
shadows
and
in
a
little
while
i
rose
and
buckled
on
my
knapsack
the
shadows
were
creeping
on
apace
but
the
sky
was
wonderfully
clear
while
low
down
upon
the
horizon
i
saw
the
moon
very
broad
and
big
it
would
be
a
brilliant
night
later
and
this
knowledge
rejoiced
me
not
a
little
before
me
stretched
a
succession
of
hills
that
chain
of
hills
which
i
believe
is
called
the
weald
and
over
which
the
dim
road
dipped
and
wound
with
on
either
hand
a
rolling
country
dark
with
wood
and
coppice
full
of
mystery
the
wind
had
quite
fallen
but
from
the
hedges
came
sudden
rustlings
and
soft
unaccountable
noises
once
something
small
and
dark
scuttered
across
the
road
before
me
and
once
a
bird
hidden
near
by
set
up
a
loud
complaint
while
from
the
deeps
of
a
neighboring
wood
came
the
mournful
note
of
a
and
as
i
walked
i
bethought
me
of
poor
bill
nye
the
tinker
i
could
picture
him
tramping
upon
this
very
road
his
jingling
load
upon
his
back
and
the
loneliness
upon
and
around
him
a
small
man
he
would
be
with
a
peaked
face
little
round
twinkling
eyes
grizzled
hair
and
a
long
blue
chin
how
i
came
to
know
all
this
i
can
not
tell
only
it
seemed
he
must
be
so
on
he
went
his
chin
first
upon
one
shoulder
and
now
upon
the
other
shooting
furtive
glances
at
hedges
which
were
not
hedges
and
trees
which
were
not
trees
somewhere
there
was
a
thing
that
looked
like
a
big
oak
tree
in
the
daytime
a
hollow
oak
on
he
went
through
the
shadows
on
and
on
presently
he
turned
out
of
the
road
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
oak
itself
kneeling
down
he
slipped
off
his
burden
and
pushed
it
through
a
jagged
hole
at
the
root
then
he
glanced
round
him
a
long
stealthy
look
down
at
the
earth
and
up
at
the
sky
and
crept
into
the
tree
in
the
dimness
i
could
see
him
fumble
for
the
thing
he
wanted
pause
to
thumb
its
edge
and
throwing
up
his
chin
raise
his
hand
folly
said
i
aloud
and
stopped
suddenly
in
my
stride
the
moon
rim
was
just
topping
the
trees
to
my
left
and
its
light
feeble
though
it
was
as
yet
served
to
show
that
i
had
reached
a
place
where
four
roads
met
now
casting
my
eyes
about
me
they
were
attracted
by
a
great
tree
that
grew
near
by
a
tree
of
vast
girth
and
bigness
and
as
i
looked
i
saw
that
it
was
an
near
the
root
of
which
there
was
a
jagged
black
hole
how
long
i
stood
staring
at
this
i
can
not
say
but
all
at
once
the
leaves
of
the
tree
were
agitated
as
by
a
breath
of
wind
and
rustled
with
a
sound
indescribably
desolate
and
from
the
dark
mass
rose
the
mournful
cry
of
some
night
bird
heedless
of
my
direction
i
hurried
away
yet
ever
when
i
had
left
it
far
behind
i
glanced
back
more
than
once
ere
its
towering
branches
were
lost
to
my
view
so
i
walked
on
through
the
shadows
past
trees
that
were
not
trees
and
hedges
that
were
not
hedges
but
frightful
phantoms
rather
lifting
menacing
arms
above
my
head
and
reaching
after
me
with
clutching
fingers
time
and
again
ashamed
of
such
weakness
i
cursed
myself
for
an
imaginative
fool
but
kept
well
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
grasped
my
staff
firmly
notwithstanding
i
had
gone
perhaps
some
mile
or
so
in
this
way
alternately
rating
and
reasoning
with
myself
when
i
suddenly
fancied
i
heard
a
step
behind
me
and
swung
round
upon
my
heel
with
ready
stick
but
the
road
stretched
away
empty
as
far
as
i
could
see
having
looked
about
me
on
all
sides
i
presently
went
on
again
yet
immediately
it
seemed
that
the
steps
began
also
keeping
time
with
my
own
now
slow
now
fast
now
slow
again
but
whenever
i
turned
the
road
behind
was
apparently
as
empty
and
desolate
as
ever
i
can
conceive
of
few
things
more
than
the
knowledge
that
we
are
being
dogged
by
something
which
we
can
only
guess
at
and
that
all
our
actions
are
watched
by
eyes
which
we
can
not
see
thus
with
every
step
i
found
the
situation
grow
more
intolerable
for
though
i
kept
a
close
watch
behind
me
and
upon
the
black
gloom
of
the
hedges
i
could
see
nothing
at
length
however
i
came
upon
a
gap
in
the
hedge
where
was
a
gate
and
beyond
this
vaguely
outlined
against
a
glimmer
of
sky
i
saw
a
dim
figure
hereupon
running
forward
i
set
my
hand
upon
the
gate
and
leaping
over
found
myself
face
to
face
with
a
man
who
carried
a
gun
across
his
arm
if
i
was
startled
at
this
sudden
encounter
he
was
no
less
so
and
thus
we
stood
eyeing
each
other
as
well
as
we
might
in
the
half
light
well
i
demanded
at
last
what
do
you
mean
by
following
me
like
this
i
are
follered
ye
retorted
the
man
but
i
heard
your
steps
behind
me
not
mine
master
i
sat
and
waited
a
hour
or
more
for
a
poachin
cove
but
some
one
was
following
me
well
it
were
i
a
keeper
i
be
for
a
poachin
cove
just
about
your
size
and
it
precious
lucky
for
you
as
you
are
that
there
why
so
because
if
you
to
be
that
there
and
i
to
be
of
a
argifyin
and
turn
o
mind
i
should
ha
filled
you
full
o
buckshot
oh
said
i
yes
said
he
nodding
while
i
experienced
a
series
of
cold
chills
up
my
spine
not
a
blessed
doubt
of
it
poachers
he
went
on
wear
as
a
rule
i
never
seed
one
as
did
and
so
while
i
was
of
you
this
i
argies
the
matter
in
my
mind
i
says
to
meself
i
sez
you
ever
to
see
a
poachin
cove
in
a
afore
no
you
never
did
sez
i
on
the
other
this
cove
is
the
very
spit
o
the
poachin
cove
as
i
for
true
sez
i
to
meself
this
cove
is
of
a
but
the
poachin
cove
never
wore
a
nor
never
will
still
i
must
say
i
come
very
near
pullin
trigger
on
ye
just
to
make
sure
so
ye
see
it
were
precious
lucky
for
you
as
you
was
o
that
there
it
certainly
was
said
i
turning
that
there
and
likewise
as
i
a
man
of
a
gift
for
argiment
and
of
a
inquirin
without
doubt
said
i
vaulting
over
the
gate
into
the
road
once
turn
o
mind
because
if
i
been
and
you
wore
that
there
the
consequences
are
unpleasantly
obvious
said
i
over
my
shoulder
as
i
walked
on
down
the
i
should
ha
shot
ye
like
a
dog
he
shouted
hanging
over
the
gate
to
do
so
and
when
i
had
gone
on
some
distance
i
took
off
that
which
the
man
had
called
a
and
bestowed
upon
it
a
touch
and
looked
at
it
as
i
had
never
done
before
and
there
was
gratitude
in
look
and
touch
for
tonight
it
had
indeed
stood
my
friend
slowly
slowly
the
moon
at
whose
advent
the
starry
host
paled
their
ineffectual
fires
mounted
into
a
cloudless
heaven
higher
and
higher
in
queenly
majesty
until
the
dark
world
was
filled
with
her
glory
and
the
road
before
me
became
transformed
into
a
silver
track
splashed
here
and
there
with
the
inky
shadow
of
hedge
and
trees
and
leading
away
into
a
land
of
faerie
indeed
to
my
mind
there
is
nothing
more
delightful
than
to
walk
upon
a
country
road
beneath
a
midsummer
moon
when
there
is
no
sound
to
break
the
stillness
save
perhaps
the
murmur
of
wind
in
trees
or
the
throbbing
melody
of
some
hidden
brook
at
such
times
the
world
of
every
day
the
world
of
things
material
the
hard
hard
world
of
seems
to
vanish
quite
and
we
walk
within
the
fair
haven
of
our
dreams
where
imagination
meets
and
kisses
us
upon
the
brow
and
at
his
touch
the
impossible
straightway
becomes
the
possible
the
abstract
becomes
the
concrete
our
fondest
hopes
are
realized
our
most
cherished
visions
take
form
and
stand
before
us
surely
at
such
an
hour
the
gods
come
down
to
walk
with
us
awhile
from
this
ecstasy
i
was
suddenly
aroused
by
hearing
once
more
the
sound
of
a
footstep
upon
the
road
behind
me
so
distinct
and
unmistakable
was
it
that
i
turned
sharp
about
and
though
the
road
seemed
as
deserted
as
ever
i
walked
back
looking
into
every
patch
of
shadow
and
even
thrust
into
the
denser
parts
of
the
hedges
with
my
staff
but
still
i
found
no
one
and
yet
i
knew
that
i
was
being
followed
persistently
step
by
step
but
by
whom
and
for
what
reason
a
little
farther
on
upon
one
side
of
the
way
was
a
small
wood
or
coppice
and
now
i
made
towards
this
keeping
well
in
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
the
trees
were
somewhat
scattered
but
the
underbrush
was
very
dense
and
amongst
this
i
hid
myself
where
i
could
watch
the
road
and
waited
minute
after
minute
elapsed
and
losing
patience
i
was
about
to
give
up
all
hope
of
thus
discovering
my
unknown
pursuer
when
a
stick
snapped
sharply
near
by
and
glancing
round
i
thought
i
saw
a
head
vanish
behind
the
bole
of
an
adjacent
tree
wherefore
i
made
quickly
towards
that
tree
but
ere
i
reached
it
a
man
stepped
out
a
tall
fellow
he
was
clad
in
rough
clothes
that
somehow
had
about
them
a
vague
suggestion
of
ships
and
the
sea
and
with
a
fur
cap
crushed
down
upon
his
head
his
face
gleamed
pale
and
his
eyes
were
and
very
bright
also
i
noticed
that
one
hand
was
hidden
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
but
most
of
all
i
was
struck
by
the
extreme
pallor
of
his
face
and
the
burning
brilliancy
of
his
eyes
and
with
the
glance
that
showed
me
all
this
i
recognized
the
outside
passenger
chapter
xvii
how
i
talked
with
a
madman
in
a
wood
by
moonlight
good
evening
sir
he
said
in
a
strange
hurried
sort
of
way
the
moon
you
will
perceive
is
very
nearly
at
the
full
and
his
voice
immediately
struck
me
as
being
at
odds
with
his
clothes
why
do
you
stand
and
peer
at
me
said
i
sharply
peer
at
you
sir
yes
from
behind
the
tree
yonder
as
i
spoke
he
craned
his
head
towards
me
and
i
saw
his
pale
lips
twitch
suddenly
and
why
have
you
dogged
me
why
have
you
followed
me
all
the
way
from
tonbridge
why
sir
surely
there
is
nothing
so
strange
in
that
i
am
a
shadow
what
do
you
mean
by
shadow
sir
i
am
a
shadow
cast
by
neither
sun
nor
moon
nor
star
that
moves
on
unceasingly
in
dark
as
in
light
sir
it
is
my
fate
in
common
with
my
kind
to
be
ever
upon
the
move
a
stranger
everywhere
without
friends
or
kindred
i
have
been
during
the
past
year
all
over
england
east
and
west
and
north
and
south
within
the
past
week
for
instance
i
have
travelled
from
london
to
epsom
from
epsom
to
brighton
from
brighton
back
again
to
london
and
from
london
here
and
i
peer
at
you
sir
because
i
wished
to
make
certain
what
manner
of
man
you
were
before
i
spoke
and
though
the
moon
is
bright
yet
your
left
your
face
in
shade
well
are
you
satisfied
so
much
so
sir
so
very
much
so
that
i
should
like
to
talk
with
you
to
to
ask
you
a
question
he
answered
passing
his
hand
a
thin
white
hand
across
his
brow
and
up
over
the
fur
cap
that
was
so
out
of
keeping
with
the
pale
face
below
a
question
if
you
will
be
so
obliging
as
to
listen
sir
let
us
sit
awhile
for
i
am
very
weary
and
with
the
words
he
sank
down
upon
the
grass
after
a
momentary
hesitation
i
followed
his
example
for
my
curiosity
was
piqued
by
the
fellow
strange
manner
yet
when
we
were
sitting
opposite
each
other
i
saw
that
his
hand
was
still
hidden
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
perhaps
sir
said
he
in
his
nervous
hurried
manner
perhaps
you
would
be
better
able
to
answer
my
question
were
i
first
to
tell
you
a
story
an
ordinary
a
very
commonplace
one
i
fear
but
with
the
virtue
that
it
is
short
and
soon
told
my
time
is
entirely
my
own
said
i
leaning
with
my
shoulders
against
the
tree
behind
me
proceed
with
your
story
first
then
my
name
is
strickland
john
strickland
here
he
paused
and
though
his
head
was
bent
i
saw
him
watching
me
beneath
his
brows
well
said
i
i
am
a
supercargo
again
he
paused
expectantly
but
seeing
i
merely
nodded
he
continued
upon
one
of
my
voyages
our
vessel
was
wrecked
and
so
far
as
i
know
all
save
myself
and
six
others
four
seamen
and
two
passengers
were
drowned
the
passengers
i
speak
of
were
an
old
merchant
and
his
daughter
a
very
beautiful
girl
her
name
was
angela
sir
once
again
he
paused
and
again
he
eyed
me
narrowly
well
said
i
well
sir
he
resumed
speaking
in
a
low
repressed
voice
we
seven
after
two
miserable
days
in
a
drifting
boat
reached
an
island
where
that
same
night
the
old
merchant
died
sir
the
sailors
were
wild
rough
men
the
island
was
a
desolate
one
from
whence
there
was
seemingly
no
chance
of
escape
it
lying
out
of
the
usual
track
of
ships
and
this
girl
was
as
i
have
said
very
beautiful
under
such
conditions
her
fate
would
have
been
unspeakable
degradation
and
probably
death
but
sir
i
fought
and
bled
for
her
not
once
but
many
times
and
eventually
i
killed
one
of
them
with
my
and
i
remember
to
this
hour
how
his
blood
gushed
over
my
hands
and
arms
and
sickened
me
after
that
they
waited
hourly
to
avenge
his
death
and
get
me
out
of
their
way
once
and
for
all
but
i
had
my
long
knife
and
they
but
such
rude
weapons
as
they
could
devise
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
i
watched
for
an
opportunity
to
escape
with
the
boat
until
at
last
one
day
while
they
were
all
three
gone
inland
not
dreaming
of
any
such
attempt
for
the
sea
was
very
dangerous
and
high
with
the
girl
help
i
managed
to
launch
the
boat
and
so
stood
out
to
sea
and
i
remember
those
three
sailors
came
running
with
great
shouts
and
cries
and
flung
themselves
down
upon
the
beach
and
crawled
upon
their
knees
praying
to
be
taken
off
along
with
us
and
begging
us
not
to
leave
them
to
perish
after
three
days
buffeting
at
the
mercy
of
the
seas
we
were
picked
up
by
a
brig
bound
for
portsmouth
and
six
months
later
were
in
england
sir
it
is
impossible
for
a
man
to
have
lived
beside
a
beautiful
woman
day
by
day
to
have
fought
for
and
suffered
with
her
not
to
love
her
also
thus
seeing
her
friendless
and
penniless
i
wooed
and
won
her
to
wife
we
came
to
london
and
for
a
year
our
life
was
perfect
until
through
stress
of
circumstances
i
was
forced
to
take
another
position
aboard
ship
well
sir
i
bade
farewell
to
my
wife
and
we
set
sail
the
voyage
which
was
to
have
lasted
but
three
months
was
lengthened
out
through
one
misadventure
after
another
so
that
it
was
a
year
before
i
saw
my
wife
again
at
first
i
noticed
little
difference
in
her
save
that
she
was
paler
but
gradually
i
came
to
see
that
she
was
unhappy
often
i
have
wakened
in
the
night
to
find
her
weeping
silently
oh
sir
he
broke
out
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
more
terrible
than
to
witness
in
one
we
love
a
sorrow
we
are
unable
to
reach
here
he
paused
and
i
saw
that
the
sweat
stood
out
upon
his
brow
and
that
his
hand
was
tight
clenched
as
he
drew
it
across
his
temples
at
last
sir
he
went
on
speaking
once
more
in
a
low
repressed
tone
returning
home
one
day
i
found
her
gone
gone
said
i
gone
sir
and
she
left
no
trace
no
letter
no
she
left
no
letter
sir
but
i
did
find
something
a
something
that
had
rolled
into
a
corner
of
the
room
and
what
was
that
this
sir
as
he
spoke
his
burning
eyes
never
leaving
mine
he
thrust
a
hand
into
his
bosom
his
left
hand
for
his
right
was
where
it
had
been
all
along
hidden
in
his
pocket
and
held
out
to
me
a
gold
seal
such
as
gentlemen
wear
at
their
fobs
ah
i
exclaimed
take
it
said
the
man
thrusting
it
towards
me
look
at
it
obediently
i
took
the
trinket
from
him
and
examining
it
as
well
as
i
might
saw
that
a
letter
was
engraved
upon
it
one
of
those
ornamental
initials
surrounded
by
rococo
scrolls
and
flourishes
what
letter
does
it
bear
asked
the
man
in
a
strangled
voice
it
looks
very
like
the
letter
i
answered
the
letter
cried
the
man
and
then
with
a
gesture
sudden
and
fierce
he
snatched
the
seal
from
me
and
thrusting
it
back
into
his
bosom
laughed
strangely
why
do
you
laugh
said
i
to
be
sure
said
he
harshly
the
light
might
be
better
and
yet
well
well
my
story
is
nearly
done
i
lived
on
in
my
lonely
house
from
day
to
day
and
month
to
month
hoping
and
waiting
for
her
to
come
back
to
me
and
one
day
she
did
come
back
to
me
just
about
this
hour
it
was
sir
and
on
just
such
another
evening
and
that
same
night
she
died
good
god
i
exclaimed
poor
fellow
and
leaning
forward
i
laid
my
hand
upon
his
knee
but
at
my
touch
he
drew
back
so
quickly
and
with
a
look
so
evil
that
i
was
startled
hands
off
said
he
and
so
sat
staring
at
me
with
his
smouldering
eyes
are
you
mad
said
i
and
sprang
to
my
feet
not
yet
he
answered
and
once
again
he
passed
his
hand
up
and
over
his
face
and
brow
no
not
yet
sir
here
he
rose
and
stood
facing
me
and
i
noticed
that
one
hand
was
still
hidden
in
his
pocket
and
thereafter
while
i
listened
to
him
i
kept
my
eyes
directed
thither
that
night
before
she
died
sir
he
continued
she
told
me
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
destroyed
her
and
killed
my
soul
and
i
have
been
searching
for
him
ever
since
east
and
west
and
north
and
south
now
sir
here
is
my
question
if
i
should
ever
meet
that
man
face
to
face
as
i
now
see
you
should
i
not
be
justified
in
killing
him
for
a
moment
i
stood
with
bent
head
yet
conscious
all
the
while
of
the
burning
eyes
that
scanned
my
face
then
yes
said
i
the
man
stood
utterly
still
his
mouth
opened
as
if
he
would
have
spoken
but
no
word
came
all
at
once
he
turned
about
and
walked
unsteadily
five
or
six
paces
now
as
i
looked
i
saw
him
suddenly
draw
his
hand
from
his
pocket
then
as
he
wheeled
i
knew
and
hurled
myself
face
downward
as
the
pistol
flashed
madman
i
cried
and
next
moment
was
on
my
feet
but
with
a
sound
that
was
neither
a
groan
nor
a
scream
and
yet
something
of
both
he
leapt
into
the
thickest
part
of
the
underbrush
and
made
off
and
standing
there
dazed
by
the
suddenness
of
it
all
i
heard
the
snapping
of
twigs
grow
fainter
and
fainter
as
he
crashed
through
in
headlong
flight
chapter
xviii
the
twigs
whipped
my
face
thorns
and
brambles
dragged
at
my
clothes
hidden
obstacles
lay
in
wait
for
my
feet
for
the
wood
grew
denser
as
i
advanced
but
i
pushed
on
heedless
alike
of
these
and
of
what
direction
i
took
but
as
luck
would
have
it
i
presently
blundered
upon
a
path
which
in
a
short
time
brought
me
out
very
suddenly
into
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
tavern
yard
for
on
either
hand
was
a
row
of
stables
and
barns
while
before
me
was
a
low
rambling
structure
which
i
judged
was
the
tavern
itself
i
was
yet
standing
looking
about
me
when
a
man
issued
from
the
stables
upon
my
right
bearing
a
hammer
in
one
hand
and
a
lanthorn
in
the
other
hallo
said
he
staring
at
me
hallo
said
i
staring
at
him
you
do
chance
to
a
about
you
i
suppose
no
said
i
humph
he
grunted
and
lowering
his
lanthorn
began
searching
among
the
cobblestones
is
this
it
i
inquired
picking
up
a
rusty
at
my
feet
ah
said
he
taking
it
from
me
with
a
nod
know
i
dropped
it

see
he
went
on

get
another
round
and
that
cussed
axle

to
be
in
place

i

gentlemen
and
a
lady

bad
for

gentleman

said
i
it

the
man
and
a
fine
feather
bed
too
but
then
lord
one
good
turn
deserves
another
meaning

bolt
are
you
the
landlord
then
i
be
and
if
you

inclined
for
a
mug
o
good
ale
say
the
word
most
willingly
said
i
but
what
of
the
axle
plenty
o
time
for
th
axle
nodded
the
landlord
and
setting
down
his
hammer
upon
a
bench
hard
by
he
led
the
way
into
the
tap
the
ale
was
very
strong
and
good
indeed
this
lovely
county
of
kent
is
justly
famous
for
such
finding
myself
very
hungry
the
landlord
forthwith
produced
a
mighty
round
of
beef
upon
which
we
both
fell
to
and
ate
with
a
will
which
done
i
pulled
out
my
pipe
and
the
landlord
fetching
himself
another
we
sat
awhile
smoking
and
presently
learning
i
was
from
london
he
began
plying
me
with
all
manner
of
questions
concerning
the
great
city
of
which
it
seemed
he
could
not
hear
enough
and
i
to
describe
its
wonders
as
well
as
i
might
at
length
bethinking
him
of
his
axle
he
rose
with
a
sigh
upon
my
requesting
to
be
shown
my
room
he
lighted
a
candle
and
led
the
way
up
a
somewhat
rickety
stair
along
a
narrow
passage
and
throwing
open
a
door
at
the
end
i
found
myself
in
a
chamber
with
a
decent
white
bed
which
he
introduced
to
my
notice
by
the
one
word
feathers
hereupon
he
pinched
off
the
snuff
of
the
candle
with
an
expression
of
ponderous
thought
and
so
the
tower
o
london
ai
a
tower
he
inquired
at
last
no
i
answered
it
is
composed
of
several
towers
surrounded
by
very
strong
battlemented
walls
ah
to
be
sure
said
he
ah
to
be
sure
and
me
allus
thought
on
it
like
it
was
a
great
big
tower
standin
in
the
midst
the
city
as
as
a
mountain
humph
not
a
tower
ha
i
be
humph
good
night
master
i
be
yes
and
having
nodded
his
head
ponderously
several
times
he
turned
and
went
ponderously
along
the
passage
and
down
the
stair
at
the
end
of
my
chamber
was
a
long
low
casement
and
drawn
thither
by
the
beauty
of
the
night
i
flung
open
the
lattice
and
leaned
out
i
looked
down
upon
a
narrow
lane
one
of
those
winding
inconsequent
byways
which
it
seems
out
of
all
possibility
can
ever
lead
the
traveler
anywhere
and
i
was
idly
wondering
what
fool
had
troubled
to
build
a
tavern
in
such
a
remote
spot
when
my
ears
were
saluted
by
the
sound
of
voices
now
immediately
beneath
my
window
there
was
a
heavy
porch
low
and
squat
from
which
jutted
a
beam
with
a
broken
and
it
was
from
beneath
this
porch
that
the
voices
proceeded
the
one
loud
and
hectoring
the
other
gruff
and
sullen
i
was
about
to
turn
away
when
a
man
stepped
out
into
the
moonlight
his
face
was
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
his
but
from
his
general
air
and
appearance
i
judged
him
to
be
one
of
the
gentlemen
whose
chaise
had
broken
down
as
i
watched
him
he
walked
slowly
round
the
angle
of
the
house
and
disappeared
in
a
little
while
i
drew
in
my
head
from
the
casement
and
having
removed
my
dusty
boots
together
with
my
knapsack
and
coat
blew
out
the
candle
and
composed
myself
to
sleep
now
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
back
upon
the
road
standing
once
more
beside
the
great
and
as
i
watched
a
small
hunched
figure
crept
from
the
jagged
opening
in
the
trunk
a
figure
with
a
jingling
pack
upon
its
back
at
sight
of
which
i
turned
and
ran
filled
with
an
indescribable
terror
but
as
i
went
the
tinker
pack
jingled
loud
behind
me
and
when
i
glanced
back
i
saw
that
he
ran
with
head
dangling
in
most
hideous
fashion
and
that
his
right
hand
grasped
a
razor
on
i
sped
faster
and
faster
but
with
the
tinker
ever
at
my
heels
until
i
had
reached
this
tavern
the
door
crashed
to
behind
me
only
just
in
time
and
i
knew
as
i
lay
there
that
he
was
standing
outside
in
the
moonlight
staring
up
at
my
casement
with
his
horrible
dead
face
here
i
very
mercifully
awoke
and
lay
for
a
while
blinking
in
the
ghostly
radiance
of
the
moon
which
was
flooding
in
at
the
window
directly
upon
me
now
whether
it
was
owing
to
the
vividness
of
my
dream
i
know
not
but
as
i
lay
there
leapt
up
within
me
a
sudden
conviction
that
somebody
was
indeed
standing
outside
in
the
lane
staring
up
at
my
window
so
firmly
was
i
convinced
of
this
that
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
i
rose
and
cautiously
approaching
the
window
peered
out
and
there
sure
enough
his
feet
planted
wide
apart
his
hands
behind
his
back
stood
a
man
staring
up
at
my
window
his
head
was
thrown
back
so
that
i
could
see
his
face
distinctly
a
fleshy
face
with
small
eyes
and
thick
lips
behind
which
i
caught
the
gleam
of
big
white
teeth
this
was
no
tinker
but
as
i
looked
i
recognized
him
as
the
slenderer
of
the
two
corinthians
with
whom
i
had
fallen
out
at
the
chequers
hereupon
i
got
me
back
to
bed
drowsily
wondering
what
should
bring
the
fellow
hanging
about
a
dilapidated
at
such
an
hour
but
gradually
my
thoughts
grew
less
coherent
my
eyes
closed
and
in
another
moment
i
should
have
been
asleep
when
i
suddenly
came
to
my
elbow
broad
awake
and
listening
for
i
had
heard
two
sounds
the
soft
creak
of
a
window
opened
cautiously
near
by
and
a
stealthy
footstep
outside
my
door
chapter
xix
in
which
i
become
a
squire
of
dames
who
does
not
recognize
the
solemn
majesty
of
night
that
season
of
awesome
stillness
when
tired
mankind
lies
supine
in
that
strange
inertia
so
like
death
when
the
soul
quitting
the
wearied
body
for
a
space
flies
hence
but
whither
what
wonder
is
it
if
at
such
an
hour
as
this
we
are
prone
to
magnify
trifles
or
that
the
most
insignificant
thing
becomes
an
omen
full
of
ghastly
meaning
and
possibilities
the
creak
of
a
door
in
the
silence
a
rustle
in
the
dark
become
to
us
of
infinitely
greater
moment
than
the
crash
of
falling
empires
thus
for
a
space
i
lay
with
ears
on
the
stretch
and
every
nerve
tingling
waiting
for
i
knew
not
what
in
a
little
i
became
conscious
of
yet
another
sound
indescribably
desolate
the
low
repressed
sound
of
a
woman
sobbing
once
more
i
rose
and
looking
down
into
the
lane
found
it
deserted
the
watcher
had
vanished
i
also
noticed
that
the
casement
next
to
mine
had
been
opened
wide
and
it
was
from
here
as
it
seemed
that
the
weeping
proceeded
after
some
little
hesitation
i
knocked
softly
upon
the
wall
at
which
the
weeping
was
checked
abruptly
save
for
an
occasional
sob
whereupon
i
presently
rapped
again
at
this
after
a
moment
or
so
i
saw
a
very
small
white
hand
appear
at
the
neighboring
window
and
next
moment
was
looking
into
a
lovely
flushed
face
framed
in
bright
hair
with
eyes
woefully
swelled
by
tears
but
a
glance
showed
me
that
she
was
young
and
of
a
rare
and
gentle
beauty
before
i
could
speak
she
laid
her
finger
upon
her
lip
with
a
warning
gesture
help
me
oh
help
me
she
whispered
hurriedly
they
have
locked
me
in
here
and
i
dare
not
go
to
bed
and
and
oh
what
shall
i
do
locked
you
in
i
exclaimed
oh
what
shall
i
do
she
sobbed
i
tell
you
i
am
afraid
of
him
his
hateful
wicked
eyes
here
a
tremor
seemed
to
shake
her
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
when
i
found
the
key
gone
from
the
door
and
remembered
his
look
as
he
bade
me
night
i
thought
i
should
have
died
i
waited
here
close
beside
the
window
listening
listening
once
i
thought
i
heard
a
step
outside
my
door
and
opened
the
casement
to
throw
myself
out
he
shall
not
find
me
here
when
he
comes
no
said
i
he
shall
not
find
you
here
when
he
comes
all
this
she
had
imparted
to
me
in
broken
whispers
and
with
her
face
still
hidden
but
at
my
words
she
peeped
at
me
through
her
fingers
you
mean
you
must
run
away
but
the
door
is
locked
there
remains
the
window
the
window
she
repeated
trembling
you
would
find
it
easy
enough
with
my
help
quick
then
she
exclaimed
and
held
out
her
hand
wait
said
i
and
turned
back
into
my
room
hereupon
having
locked
the
door
i
got
into
my
boots
slipped
on
my
coat
and
knapsack
and
last
of
all
threw
my
blackthorn
staff
out
of
the
window
where
i
was
sure
of
finding
it
and
climbed
out
after
it
the
porch
i
have
mentioned
upon
which
i
now
stood
sloped
steeply
down
upon
two
sides
so
that
i
had
no
little
difficulty
in
maintaining
my
foothold
on
the
other
hand
it
was
no
great
distance
from
the
ground
and
i
thought
that
it
would
be
easy
enough
of
descent
at
this
moment
the
lady
reappeared
at
the
lattice
what
is
it
i
whispered
struck
by
the
terror
in
her
face
quick
she
cried
forgetting
all
prudence
in
her
fear
quick
they
are
coming
i
hear
some
one
upon
the
stair
oh
you
are
too
late
and
sinking
upon
her
knees
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
without
more
ado
i
swung
myself
up
and
clambered
over
the
sill
into
the
room
beside
her
i
was
looking
round
for
something
that
might
serve
me
for
a
weapon
when
my
eye
encountered
a
tall
oak
press
a
heavy
cumbersome
affair
but
save
the
bed
the
only
furniture
the
room
possessed
setting
my
shoulder
to
it
therefore
i
began
to
urge
it
towards
the
door
but
it
was
soon
apparent
that
i
could
not
get
it
there
in
time
for
the
creeping
footstep
was
already
close
outside
and
next
moment
a
key
was
softly
inserted
in
the
lock
quick
hide
yourself
i
whispered
over
my
shoulder
and
stepping
back
from
the
door
to
give
myself
room
i
clenched
my
fists
there
was
a
faint
creak
as
the
key
turned
the
door
was
opened
cautiously
and
a
man
dim
figure
loomed
upon
the
threshold
he
had
advanced
two
or
three
paces
on
tiptoe
before
he
discovered
my
presence
for
the
room
was
in
shadow
and
i
heard
his
breath
catch
suddenly
and
hiss
between
his
teeth
then
without
a
word
he
sprang
at
me
but
as
he
came
i
leapt
aside
and
my
fist
took
him
full
and
squarely
beneath
the
ear
he
pitched
sideways
and
falling
heavily
rolled
over
upon
his
back
and
lay
still
as
i
leaned
above
him
however
for
the
blow
had
been
a
heavy
one
he
uttered
a
groaning
oath
whereupon
pinning
him
forthwith
by
the
collar
i
dragged
him
out
into
the
passage
and
whipping
the
key
from
the
lock
transferred
it
to
the
inside
and
locked
the
door
waiting
for
no
more
i
scrambled
back
through
the
casement
and
reached
up
my
hand
to
the
lady
come
said
i
and
almost
as
quickly
as
it
takes
to
set
it
down
here
she
was
beside
me
upon
the
roof
of
the
porch
clinging
to
my
arm
exactly
how
it
was
managed
i
am
unable
to
say
all
that
i
remember
being
the
vision
of
a
slender
foot
and
ankle
and
an
excellently
shaped
leg
our
farther
descent
to
the
ground
proved
much
more
difficult
than
i
had
supposed
but
though
i
could
feel
her
trembling
my
companion
obeyed
my
whispered
instructions
and
yielded
herself
implicitly
to
my
guidance
so
that
we
were
soon
standing
in
the
lane
before
the
house
safe
and
sound
except
for
a
few
rents
to
our
garments
what
is
it
she
whispered
seeing
me
searching
about
in
the
grass
my
staff
said
i
a
faithful
friend
i
would
not
lose
it
but
they
will
be
here
in
a
minute
we
shall
be
seen
i
can
not
lose
my
staff
said
i
oh
hurry
hurry
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
and
in
a
little
while
having
found
my
staff
we
turned
our
backs
upon
the
tavern
and
began
to
run
up
the
lane
side
by
side
as
we
went
came
the
slam
of
a
door
behind
us
a
sudden
clamor
of
voices
followed
a
moment
later
by
the
sharp
report
of
a
pistol
and
in
that
same
fraction
of
time
i
stumbled
over
some
unseen
obstacle
and
my
hat
was
whisked
from
my
head
are
you
hurt
panted
my
companion
no
said
i
but
it
was
a
very
excellent
shot
nevertheless
for
as
i
picked
up
my
hat
i
saw
a
small
round
hole
that
pierced
it
through
and
through
midway
between
crown
and
brim
the
lane
wound
away
between
high
hedges
which
rendered
our
going
very
dark
for
the
moon
was
getting
low
and
difficult
by
reason
of
the
deep
but
we
hurried
forward
notwithstanding
urged
on
by
the
noise
of
the
chase
we
had
traversed
some
half
mile
thus
when
my
ears
warned
me
that
our
pursuers
were
gaining
upon
us
and
i
was
inwardly
congratulating
myself
that
i
had
stopped
to
find
my
staff
and
wondering
how
much
execution
such
a
weapon
might
reasonably
be
capable
of
when
i
found
that
my
companion
was
no
longer
at
my
side
as
i
paused
irresolute
her
voice
reached
me
from
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
this
way
she
panted
where
said
i
here
and
as
she
spoke
her
hand
slipped
into
mine
and
so
she
led
me
through
a
small
gate
into
a
broad
open
meadow
beyond
but
to
attempt
crossing
this
would
be
little
short
of
madness
for
as
i
pointed
out
we
could
not
go
a
yard
without
being
seen
no
no
she
returned
her
breath
still
laboring
wait
wait
till
they
are
past
and
so
hand
in
hand
we
stood
there
in
the
shadow
screened
very
effectively
from
the
lane
by
the
thick
hedge
while
the
rush
of
our
pursuers
feet
drew
nearer
and
nearer
until
we
could
hear
a
voice
that
panted
out
curses
upon
the
dark
lane
ourselves
and
everything
concerned
at
sound
of
which
my
companion
seemed
to
fall
into
a
shivering
fit
her
clasp
tightened
upon
my
hand
and
she
drew
closer
to
me
thus
we
remained
until
voices
and
footsteps
had
grown
faint
with
distance
but
even
then
i
could
feel
that
she
was
trembling
still
suddenly
she
drew
her
fingers
from
mine
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
oh
that
man
she
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
i
did
quite
realize
till
now
what
i
have
escaped
oh
that
beast
sir
harry
mortimer
said
i
you
know
him
she
cried
heaven
forbid
i
answered
but
i
have
seen
him
once
before
at
chequers
inn
at
tonbridge
and
i
never
forget
names
or
faces
especially
such
as
his
how
i
hate
him
she
whispered
an
unpleasant
animal
to
be
sure
said
i
but
come
it
were
wiser
to
get
as
far
from
here
as
possible
they
will
doubtless
be
returning
soon
so
we
started
off
again
running
in
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
we
had
thus
doubled
back
upon
our
pursuers
and
leaving
the
tavern
upon
our
left
soon
gained
the
kindly
shadow
of
those
woods
through
which
i
had
passed
in
the
early
evening
borne
to
us
upon
the
gentle
wind
was
the
haunting
perfume
of
hidden
flowers
and
the
sinking
moon
sent
long
shafts
of
silvery
light
to
pierce
the
leafy
gloom
and
make
the
shadows
more
mysterious
the
path
we
followed
was
very
narrow
so
that
sometimes
my
knee
touched
mine
or
her
long
silken
hair
brushed
my
brow
or
cheek
as
i
stooped
to
lift
some
trailing
branch
that
barred
her
way
or
open
a
path
for
her
through
the
leaves
so
we
journeyed
on
through
the
mysteries
of
the
woods
together
chapter
xx
concerning
daemons
in
general
and
one
in
particular
in
certain
old
books
you
shall
find
strange
mention
of
witches
warlocks
succubae
spirits
daemons
and
a
thousand
other
powers
of
darkness
whose
pronounced
vocation
was
the
plague
of
poor
humanity
within
these
books
you
may
read
if
you
will
divers
wondrous
accounts
together
with
many
learned
disquisitions
upon
the
same
and
most
minute
and
particular
descriptions
of
and
the
like
aforetime
when
a
man
committed
some
great
offence
against
laws
human
or
divine
he
was
said
to
be
possessed
of
a
daemon
that
is
to
say
he
became
the
medium
and
instrument
through
and
by
which
the
evil
was
wrought
thus
when
in
due
season
he
came
to
be
hanged
tortured
or
burned
it
was
inflicted
not
so
much
as
a
punishment
upon
him
the
man
as
to
exorcise
once
and
for
all
the
devil
which
possessed
him
in
these
material
days
we
are
wont
to
smile
the
superior
smile
at
the
dark
superstitions
and
deplorable
ignorance
of
our
forefathers
yet
life
is
much
the
same
now
as
then
the
devil
goeth
up
and
down
in
the
world
spirits
daemons
and
the
thousand
powers
of
darkness
abide
with
us
still
though
they
go
by
different
names
for
there
is
no
man
in
this
smug
complacent
age
of
ours
but
carries
within
him
a
power
of
evil
greater
or
less
according
to
his
intellect
scratch
off
the
social
veneer
lift
but
a
corner
of
the
very
decent
cloak
of
our
civilization
and
behold
there
stands
the
primal
man
in
all
his
old
wild
savagery
and
with
the
devil
leering
upon
his
shoulder
indeed
as
surely
as
in
the
dim
past
we
are
all
possessed
of
a
devil
great
or
small
weaker
or
stronger
as
the
case
may
be
a
demon
which
though
he
sometimes
seems
to
slumber
is
yet
watchful
and
ever
ready
to
spring
up
and
possess
us
to
the
undoing
of
ourselves
and
others
thus
as
i
followed
my
companion
through
the
wood
i
was
conscious
of
a
daemon
that
ran
beside
me
leaping
and
gambolling
at
my
elbow
though
i
kept
my
eyes
straight
before
me
anon
his
clutching
fingers
were
upon
my
arm
and
fain
i
would
have
shaken
him
off
but
could
not
while
as
i
watched
the
swing
and
grace
of
the
lithe
feminine
body
before
me
from
the
little
foot
to
the
crowning
glory
of
her
hair
she
seemed
a
thousand
times
more
beautiful
than
i
had
supposed
and
i
had
saved
her
tonight
from
what
there
had
been
the
fear
of
worse
than
death
in
her
eyes
when
that
step
had
sounded
outside
her
chamber
door
hereupon
as
i
walked
i
began
to
recall
much
that
i
had
read
in
the
old
romances
of
the
gratitude
of
rescued
ladies
truly
said
i
to
myself
in
olden
days
a
lady
well
knew
how
to
reward
her
rescuer
woman
is
woman
the
same
as
then
try
her
try
her
chuckled
the
daemon
and
now
as
i
looked
more
fully
at
this
damon
he
seemed
no
daemon
at
all
but
rather
a
jovial
companion
who
nodded
and
winked
and
nudged
me
slyly
with
his
elbow
what
are
pretty
faces
for
but
to
be
admired
said
he
in
my
ear
what
are
slender
waists
for
but
to
be
pressed
and
as
for
a
kiss
or
two
in
a
dark
wood
with
no
one
to
spy
they
like
it
you
dog
they
like
it
so
we
traversed
the
alleys
of
the
wood
now
in
shadow
now
in
moonlight
the
lady
the
daemon
and
i
and
always
the
perfume
of
hidden
flowers
seemed
sweeter
and
stronger
the
gleam
of
her
hair
and
the
sway
of
her
body
the
more
alluring
and
always
the
voice
at
my
ear
whispered
try
her
you
dog
try
her
at
last
being
come
to
a
broad
grassy
glade
the
lady
paused
and
standing
in
the
full
radiance
of
the
dying
moon
looked
up
at
me
with
a
smile
on
her
red
lips
they
can
never
find
us
now
she
said
no
they
can
never
find
us
now
i
repeated
while
the
daemon
at
my
elbow
chuckled
again
and
oh
sir
i
can
never
never
thank
you
she
began
do
said
i
not
looking
at
her
do
thank
me
till
we
are
out
of
the
wood
i
think
she
went
on
slowly
that
you
can
guess
from
from
what
you
saved
me
and
can
understand
something
of
my
gratitude
for
i
can
never
express
it
all
indeed
said
i
indeed
you
overestimate
my
service
you
risked
your
life
for
me
sir
said
she
her
eyes
glistening
surely
my
thanks
are
due
to
you
for
that
and
i
do
thank
you
from
my
heart
and
with
a
swift
impulsive
gesture
she
stretched
out
her
hands
to
me
for
a
brief
moment
i
hesitated
then
seized
them
and
drew
her
close
but
even
as
i
stooped
above
her
she
repulsed
me
desperately
her
loosened
hair
brushed
my
eyes
and
lips
blinded
maddened
me
my
hat
fell
off
and
all
at
once
her
struggles
ceased
sir
maurice
vibart
she
panted
and
i
saw
a
hopeless
terror
in
her
face
but
the
daemon
jovial
voice
chuckled
in
my
ear
ho
peter
vibart
act
up
to
your
cousin
reputation
who
to
know
the
difference
my
arms
tightened
about
her
then
i
loosed
her
suddenly
and
turning
smote
my
clenched
fist
against
a
tree
which
done
i
stooped
and
picked
up
my
hat
and
blackthorn
staff
madam
said
i
looking
down
upon
my
bleeding
knuckles
i
am
not
sir
maurice
vibart
it
seems
my
fate
to
be
mistaken
for
him
wherever
i
go
my
name
is
peter
plain
and
unvarnished
and
i
am
very
humbly
your
servant
now
as
i
spoke
it
seemed
that
the
daemon
no
longer
the
jovial
companion
was
himself
again
horns
hoof
and
tail
nay
indeed
he
seemed
a
thousand
times
more
foul
and
hideous
than
before
as
he
mouthed
and
jibed
at
me
in
baffled
fury
wherefore
i
smiled
and
turned
my
back
upon
him
come
said
i
extending
my
hand
to
the
trembling
girl
let
us
get
out
of
these
dismal
woods
for
a
space
she
hesitated
looking
up
at
me
beneath
her
lashes
then
reached
out
and
laid
her
fingers
in
mine
and
as
we
turned
away
i
knew
that
the
daemon
had
cast
himself
upon
the
ground
and
was
tearing
at
the
grass
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
and
bafflement
it
is
strange
said
i
after
we
had
gone
some
little
distance
very
strange
that
you
should
only
have
discovered
this
resemblance
here
and
now
for
surely
you
saw
my
face
plainly
enough
at
the
inn
no
you
see
i
hardly
looked
at
you
and
now
that
you
do
look
at
me
am
i
so
very
much
like
sir
maurice
not
now
she
answered
shaking
her
head
for
though
you
are
of
his
height
and
though
your
features
are
much
the
same
as
his
your
expression
is
different
but
a
moment
ago
when
your
hat
fell
off
yes
said
i
your
expression
your
face
looked
demoniac
i
suggested
yes
she
answered
yes
said
i
so
we
went
upon
our
way
nor
paused
until
we
had
left
the
daemon
and
the
dark
woods
behind
us
then
i
looked
from
the
beauty
of
the
sweet
pure
earth
to
the
beauty
of
her
who
stood
beside
me
and
i
saw
that
her
glance
rested
upon
the
broken
knuckles
of
my
right
hand
meeting
my
eyes
her
own
drooped
and
a
flush
crept
into
her
cheeks
and
though
of
course
she
could
not
have
seen
the
daemon
yet
i
think
that
she
understood

the

below

what
time

reached

a

slowly
chimed
the

the
lady
sophia
sefton
of
cambourne
said
i
thoughtfully
my
dearest
friend
nodded
my
companion
they
say
she
is
very
handsome
said
i
then
they
speak
truth
sir
she
has
been
described
to
me
i
went
on
as
a
peach
a
goddess
and
a
plum
which
should
you
consider
the
most
proper
term
my
companion
shot
an
arch
glance
at
me
from
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
i
saw
a
dimple
come
and
go
beside
the
curve
of
her
mouth
goddess
to
be
sure
said
she
peaches
have
such
rough
skins
and
plums
are
apt
to
be
sticky
and
goddesses
i
added
were
all
very
well
upon
olympus
but
in
this
age
must
be
sadly
out
of
place
speaking
for
myself
have
you
ever
seen
this
particular
goddess
inquired
my
companion
never
then
wait
until
you
have
sir
the
moon
was
down
now
yet
the
summer
sky
was
wonderfully
luminous
and
in
the
east
i
almost
fancied
i
could
detect
the
first
faint
gleam
of
day
and
after
we
had
traversed
some
distance
in
silence
my
companion
suddenly
spoke
but
without
looking
at
me
you
have
never
once
asked
who
i
am
she
said
almost
reproachfully
i
thought
nor
how
i
came
to
be
shut
up
in
such
a
place
with
such
a
man
why
as
to
that
i
answered
i
make
it
a
general
rule
to
avoid
awkward
subjects
when
i
can
and
never
to
ask
questions
that
it
will
be
difficult
to
answer
i
should
find
not
the
least
difficulty
in
answering
either
said
she
besides
i
continued
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
after
all
oh
said
she
turning
away
from
me
and
then
very
slowly
no
i
suppose
not
certainly
not
i
added
how
should
it
be
how
indeed
said
she
over
her
shoulder
and
then
i
saw
that
she
was
angry
and
wondered
and
yet
i
went
on
after
a
lapse
of
silence
i
think
i
could
have
answered
both
questions
the
moment
i
saw
you
at
your
casement
oh
said
she
this
time
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
her
anger
all
gone
again
for
i
saw
that
she
was
smiling
and
again
i
wondered
yes
i
nodded
then
said
she
seeing
i
was
silent
whom
do
you
suppose
me
you
are
to
the
best
of
my
belief
the
lady
helen
dunstan
my
companion
stood
still
and
regarded
me
for
a
moment
in
astonishment
and
how
air
pray
did
you
learn
all
this
she
demanded
with
the
dimple
once
more
peeping
at
me
slyly
from
the
corner
of
her
pretty
mouth
by
the
very
simple
method
of
adding
two
and
two
together
i
answered
moreover
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
i
broke
bread
with
a
certain
beverley
i
heard
her
breath
come
in
a
sudden
gasp
and
next
moment
she
was
peering
up
into
my
face
while
her
hands
beat
upon
my
breast
with
soft
quick
little
taps
beverley
she
whispered
beverley
no
no
why
they
told
me
sir
harry
told
me
that
peregrine
lay
dying
at
tonbridge
then
sir
harry
mortimer
lied
to
you
said
i
for
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
afternoon
i
sat
in
a
ditch
eating
bread
and
cheese
with
a
mr
peregrine
beverley
oh
are
you
sure
are
you
sure
quite
sure
and
as
we
ate
he
told
me
many
things
and
among
them
of
a
life
of
wasted
opportunities
of
foolish
riot
and
prodigal
extravagance
and
of
its
logical
consequence
want
my
poor
perry
she
murmured
he
spoke
also
of
his
love
for
a
very
beautiful
and
good
woman
and
its
hopelessness
my
dear
dear
perry
said
she
again
and
yet
said
i
all
this
is
admittedly
his
own
fault
and
as
i
think
heraclitus
says
is
the
inevitable
consequence
of
sin
or
folly
and
he
is
well
she
asked
quite
quite
well
he
is
said
i
thank
god
she
whispered
tell
me
she
went
on
is
he
so
very
very
poor
is
he
much
altered
i
have
not
seen
him
for
a
whole
long
year
why
a
year
is
apt
to
change
a
man
i
answered
adversity
is
a
hard
school
but
sometimes
a
very
good
one
were
he
changed
no
matter
how
were
he
a
beggar
upon
the
roads
i
should
love
him
always
said
she
speaking
in
that
soft
caressing
voice
which
only
the
best
of
women
possess
yes
i
had
guessed
as
much
said
i
and
found
myself
sighing
a
year
is
a
long
long
time
and
we
were
to
have
been
married
this
month
but
my
father
quarrelled
with
him
and
forbade
him
the
house
so
poor
perry
went
back
to
london
then
we
heard
he
was
ruined
and
i
almost
died
with
grief
you
see
his
very
poverty
only
made
me
love
him
the
more
yesterday
that
man
sir
harry
mortimer
said
i
yes
he
was
a
friend
of
whom
i
had
often
heard
perry
speak
and
he
told
me
that
my
perry
lay
at
tonbridge
dying
and
begging
to
see
me
before
the
end
he
offered
to
escort
me
to
him
assuring
me
that
i
could
reach
home
again
long
before
dusk
my
father
who
i
knew
would
never
permit
me
to
go
was
absent
and
so
i
ran
away
sir
harry
had
a
carriage
waiting
but
almost
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
upon
us
and
we
had
started
i
began
to
be
afraid
of
him
and
and
sir
harry
as
i
said
before
is
an
unpleasant
animal
i
nodded
thank
heaven
she
pursued
we
had
not
gone
very
far
before
the
chaise
broke
down
and
the
rest
you
know
the
footpath
we
had
been
following
now
led
over
a
stile
into
a
narrow
lane
or
byway
very
soon
we
came
to
a
high
stone
wall
wherein
was
set
a
small
wicket
through
this
she
led
me
and
we
entered
a
broad
park
where
was
an
avenue
of
fine
old
trees
beyond
which
i
saw
the
gables
of
a
house
for
the
stars
had
long
since
paled
to
the
dawn
and
there
was
a
glory
in
the
east
your
father
will
be
rejoiced
to
have
you
safe
back
again
said
i
yes
she
nodded
but
he
will
be
very
angry
and
hereupon
she
stopped
and
began
to
pull
and
twist
and
pat
her
shining
hair
with
dexterous
white
fingers
talking
thus
the
while
my
mother
died
at
my
birth
and
since
then
father
has
worshipped
her
memory
and
his
face
always
grows
wonderfully
gentle
when
he
looks
upon
her
portrait
they
say
i
greatly
like
her
though
she
was
a
famous
beauty
in
her
day
and
indeed
i
think
there
must
be
some
truth
in
it
for
no
matter
how
i
may
put
him
out
my
father
can
never
be
very
angry
when
my
hair
is
dressed
so
with
the
word
she
turned
and
truly
i
thought
the
face
peeping
out
from
its
clustered
curls
even
more
lovely
and
bewitching
than
before
i
very
much
doubt
if
any
man
could
said
i
as
we
approached
the
house
i
saw
that
the
smooth
gravel
was
much
cut
up
as
though
by
the
coming
and
going
of
many
wheels
and
horses
and
also
that
one
of
the
windows
still
shone
with
a
bright
light
and
it
was
towards
this
window
that
my
companion
led
me
in
a
while
having
climbed
the
terrace
steps
i
noticed
that
this
was
one
of
those
french
windows
opening
to
the
ground
now
looking
through
into
the
room
beyond
i
beheld
an
old
man
who
sat
bowed
down
at
a
table
with
his
white
head
pillowed
upon
his
arms
sitting
so
very
still
that
he
might
have
been
asleep
but
for
the
fierce
grip
of
his
twitching
hands
now
upon
the
table
at
no
great
distance
from
him
between
the
guttering
candles
lay
a
hat
a
very
object
which
i
thought
i
recognized
wherefore
looking
about
i
presently
espied
its
owner
leaning
against
the
mantel
he
was
powdered
with
dust
from
head
to
foot
and
his
worn
garments
looked
more
ragged
than
ever
and
as
he
stood
there
in
the
droop
of
his
head
and
the
listless
set
of
his
shoulders
there
was
an
air
of
the
most
utter
dejection
and
hopelessness
while
upon
his
thin
cheek
i
saw
the
glisten
of
a
great
solitary
tear
but
as
i
looked
the
window
was
burst
suddenly
open
perry
love
surprise
joy
pity
all
were
summed
up
in
that
one
short
word
yet
deeper
than
all
was
love
and
at
that
cry
the
white
head
was
raised
raised
in
time
to
see
a
vision
of
loveliness
caught
up
in
two
ragged
arms
father
and
now
the
three
heads
the
white
the
golden
and
the
black
were
drawn
down
together
drawn
and
held
close
in
an
embrace
that
was
indeed
reunion
then
seeing
my
presence
was
become
wholly
unnecessary
i
turned
away
and
was
soon
once
more
deep
among
the
trees
yet
as
i
went
i
suddenly
heard
voices
that
called
upon
my
name
but
i
kept
on
and
in
due
season
came
out
upon
the
broad
highway
and
in
a
little
as
i
went
very
full
of
thought
the
sun
rose
up
so
i
walked
along
through
a
world
all
glorious
with
morning
chapter
xxii
in
which
i
meet
with
a
literary
tinker
even
in
that
drowsy
state
that
most
delightful
borderland
which
lies
midway
between
sleeping
and
waking
i
knew
it
could
not
be
the
woodpecker
who
as
i
judged
from
sundry
manifest
signs
lodged
in
the
tree
above
me
no
woodpecker
that
ever
pecked
could
originate
such
sounds
as
these
two
quick
light
strokes
followed
by
another
and
heavier
thus
tap
tap
tap
a
pause
and
then
tap
tap
tap
again
and
so
on
whatever
doubts
i
may
have
yet
harbored
on
the
subject
however
were
presently
dispelled
by
a
fragrance
sweeter
to
the
nostrils
of
a
hungry
man
than
the
breath
of
flowers
the
spices
of
the
east
or
all
the
vaunted
perfumes
of
arabia
in
a
word
the
odor
of
frying
bacon
hereupon
i
suddenly
realized
how
exceedingly
keen
was
my
appetite
and
sighed
bethinking
me
that
i
must
first
find
a
tavern
before
i
could
satisfy
my
craving
when
a
voice
reached
me
from
no
great
distance
a
full
rich
sonorous
voice
singing
a
song
and
the
words
of
the
song
were
these
a
tinker
i
am
o
a
tinker
am
i
a
tinker
i
live
and
a
tinker
i
die
if
the
king
in
his
crown
would
change
places
wi
me
i
laugh
so
i
would
and
i
say
unto
he
tinker
i
am
o
a
tinker
am
i
a
tinker
i
live
and
a
tinker
i
die
it
was
a
quaint
air
with
a
shake
at
the
end
of
the
first
two
and
last
two
lines
which
altogether
i
thought
very
pleasing
i
advanced
guided
by
the
voice
until
i
came
out
into
a
grassy
lane
seated
upon
an
folding
stool
was
a
man
he
was
a
very
small
man
despite
his
great
voice
who
held
a
kettle
between
his
knees
and
a
light
hammer
in
his
hand
while
a
little
to
one
side
of
him
there
blazed
a
crackling
fire
of
twigs
upon
which
a
hissing
was
balanced
but
what
chiefly
drew
and
held
my
attention
was
the
face
narrow
and
peaked
with
little
round
twinkling
eyes
set
deep
in
his
head
close
black
hair
grizzled
at
the
temples
and
a
long
blue
chin
and
presently
as
i
stood
staring
at
him
he
finished
his
song
and
chancing
to
raise
his
eyes
stared
back
at
me
good
morning
said
he
at
last
with
a
bright
nod
so
then
you
did
cut
your
throat
in
the
hollow
oak
after
all
said
i
nor
likely
to
either
master
he
answered
shaking
his
head
lord
love
your
eyes
and
limbs
no
but
said
i
some
day
or
so
ago
i
met
a
man
ah
nodded
the
tinker
to
be
sure
you
did
a
pedler
of
brooms
and
ribands
dick
nodded
the
tinker
who
told
me
very
seriously
that
i
been
found
in
the
big
holler
oak
wi
my
throat
cut
nodded
the
tinker
but
what
did
he
mean
by
it
why
y
see
explained
the
tinker
leaning
over
to
turn
a
frizzling
very
dexterously
with
the
blade
of
a
y
see
dick
is
oncommon
fond
of
murders
hangings
sooicides
and
such
like
it
just
a
way
he
got
a
very
unpleasant
way
said
i
but
very
harmless
when
all
done
and
said
added
the
tinker
you
mean
a
leetle
weak
up
here
explained
the
tinker
tapping
his
forehead
with
the
handle
of
the
his
father
was
murdered
the
day
afore
he
were
born
d
see
which
druv
his
poor
mother
out
of
her
mind
which
conditions
is
apt
to
make
a
man
a
leetle
strange
poor
fellow
said
i
while
the
tinker
began
his
again
are
you
hungry
he
inquired
suddenly
glancing
up
at
me
with
his
hammer
poised
very
hungry
said
hereupon
he
set
down
his
hammer
and
turning
to
a
pack
at
his
side
proceeded
to
extract
therefrom
a
loaf
of
bread
a
small
tin
of
butter
and
a
piece
of
bacon
from
which
last
he
cut
sundry
slices
with
the
he
now
lifted
the
hissing
rashers
from
the
pan
to
a
tin
plate
which
he
set
upon
the
grass
at
my
feet
together
with
the
bread
and
the
butter
and
having
produced
a
somewhat
battered
knife
and
fork
handed
them
to
me
with
another
bright
nod
you
are
very
kind
said
i
why
i
a
man
as
is
fond
o
company
y
see
especially
of
one
who
can
think
and
talk
and
you
have
the
face
of
both
i
am
as
you
might
say
a
literary
cove
being
fond
o
books
and
such
like
and
in
a
little
while
the
bacon
being
done
to
his
liking
we
sat
down
together
and
began
to
eat
that
was
a
strange
song
of
yours
said
i
after
a
while
did
you
like
it
he
inquired
with
a
quick
tilt
of
his
head
both
words
and
tune
i
answered
i
made
the
words
myself
said
the
tinker
and
do
you
mean
it
mean
what
asked
the
tinker
that
you
would
rather
be
a
tinker
than
a
king
why
to
be
sure
i
would
he
rejoined
bein
a
literary
cove
i
know
summat
o
history
and
a
king
life
were
all
lavender
not
by
no
manner
o
means
nor
yet
a
bed
o
roses
yet
there
much
to
be
said
for
a
king
very
little
i
think
said
the
tinker
a
king
has
great
advantages
which
he
generally
abuses
said
the
tinker
there
have
been
some
great
and
noble
kings
but
a
great
many
more
bad
said
the
tinker
and
then
look
how
often
they
got
theirselves
pisoned
or
stabbed
or
their
chopped
off
no
if
you
axes
me
i
prefer
to
tinker
a
kettle
under
a
hedge
then
you
are
contented
not
quite
he
answered
his
face
falling
me
being
a
literary
cove
as
i
think
i
mentioned
afore
it
has
always
been
my
wish
to
be
a
scholar
far
better
be
a
tinker
said
i
young
fellow
said
the
tinker
shaking
his
head
reprovingly
off
the
mark
there
knowledge
is
power
why
lord
love
my
eyes
and
limbs
what
finer
than
to
be
able
to
read
in
the
greek
and
latin
to
possess
the
capacity
of
earning
an
honest
livelihood
said
i
why
i
tell
you
continued
the
tinker
unheeding
my
remark
i
give
this
here
left
hand
o
mine
to
be
able
to
read
the
very
words
of
such
men
as
plato
aristotle
epictetus
xenophon
and
all
the
rest
of
there
are
numerous
translations
said
i
ah
to
be
sure
sighed
the
tinker
but
then
they
are
translations
there
are
good
translations
as
well
as
bad
said
i
maybe
returned
the
tinker
maybe
but
a
translation
only
a
echo
after
all
however
good
it
be
as
he
spoke
he
dived
into
his
pack
and
brought
forth
a
book
which
he
handed
to
me
it
was
a
smallish
volume
in
battered
leathern
covers
and
had
evidently
seen
much
long
and
hard
service
opening
it
at
the
i
read
epictetus
his
enchiridion
with
simplicius
his
comment
made
english
from
the
greek
by
george
stanhope
late
fellow
of
king
college
in
camb
london
printed
for
richard
sare
at
gray
inn
gate
in
holborn
and
joseph
hindmarsh
against
the
exchange
in
cornhill
you
read
epictetus
perhaps
inquired
the
tinker
i
have
not
in
the
greek
of
course
yes
said
i
smiling
though
by
dint
of
much
labor
the
tinker
stopped
chewing
to
stare
at
me
then
swallowed
his
mouthful
at
one
gulp
lord
love
me
he
exclaimed
and
you
so
young
too
no
said
i
i
and
latin
now
do
tell
me
you
can
read
the
latin
but
i
ca
make
a
kettle
or
even
mend
one
for
that
matter
said
i
but
you
are
a
scholar
and
it
a
fine
thing
to
be
a
scholar
and
i
tell
you
again
it
is
better
to
be
a
tinker
said
i
how
so
it
is
a
healthier
life
in
the
first
place
said
i
that
i
can
believe
nodded
the
tinker
it
is
a
happier
life
in
the
second
place
that
i
doubt
returned
the
tinker
and
in
the
third
place
it
pays
much
better
that
i
do
believe
said
the
tinker
nevertheless
said
i
speaking
for
myself
i
have
in
the
course
of
my
years
earned
but
ten
shillings
and
that
but
by
the
sale
of
my
waistcoat
lord
love
me
exclaimed
the
tinker
staring
a
man
i
pursued
may
be
a
far
better
scholar
than
i
may
be
full
of
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
and
the
teachings
of
all
the
great
thinkers
and
philosophers
and
yet
starve
to
death
indeed
frequently
does
but
who
ever
heard
of
a
starving
tinker
but
a
scholar
may
write
great
books
said
the
tinker
a
scholar
rarely
writes
a
great
book
said
i
shaking
my
head
probably
for
the
good
and
sufficient
reason
that
great
books
never
written
young
fellow
said
the
tinker
staring
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
that
truly
great
books
only
happen
and
very
rarely
but
a
scholar
may
happen
to
write
a
great
book
said
the
tinker
to
be
sure
he
may
a
book
that
nobody
will
risk
publishing
and
if
so
a
book
that
nobody
will
trouble
to
read
nowadays
why
so
because
this
is
an
eminently
unliterary
age
incapable
of
thought
and
therefore
seeking
to
be
amused
whereas
the
writing
of
books
was
once
a
painful
art
it
has
of
late
become
a
trick
very
easy
of
accomplishment
requiring
no
regard
for
probability
and
little
thought
so
long
as
it
is
packed
sufficiently
full
of
impossible
incidents
through
which
a
ridiculous
heroine
and
a
more
absurd
hero
duly
sigh
their
appointed
way
to
the
last
chapter
whereas
books
were
once
a
power
they
are
of
late
degenerated
into
things
of
amusement
with
which
to
kill
an
idle
hour
and
be
promptly
forgotten
the
next
yet
the
great
books
remain
said
the
tinker
yes
said
i
but
who
troubles
their
head
over
homer
or
virgil
these
days
who
cares
to
open
steele
or
addison
while
there
is
the
latest
novel
to
be
had
or
life
to
be
found
on
any
table
and
why
said
the
tinker
looking
at
me
over
a
piece
of
bacon
skewered
upon
the
point
of
his
why
do
you
write
a
book
i
probably
shall
some
day
i
answered
and
supposing
said
the
tinker
eyeing
the
piece
of
bacon
thoughtfully
supposing
nobody
ever
reads
it
the
worse
for
them
said
i
thus
we
talked
of
books
and
the
making
of
books
something
of
which
i
have
already
set
down
in
another
place
until
our
meal
was
at
an
end
you
are
a
rather
strange
young
man
i
think
said
the
tinker
as
having
duly
wiped
knife
and
fork
and
plate
upon
a
handful
of
grass
i
handed
them
back
yet
you
are
a
stranger
tinker
how
so
why
who
ever
heard
of
a
tinker
who
wrote
verses
and
worked
with
a
copy
of
epictetus
at
his
elbow
which
i
do
deny
as
i
a
great
thinker
nodded
the
tinker
to
be
sure
i
think
a
powerful
lot
a
dangerous
habit
said
i
shaking
my
head
and
a
most
unwise
one
eh
cried
the
tinker
staring
your
serious
thinking
man
i
explained
is
seldom
happy
as
a
rule
has
few
friends
being
generally
regarded
askance
and
is
always
misunderstood
by
his
fellows
all
the
world
great
thinkers
from
christ
down
were
generally
misunderstood
looked
at
askance
and
had
very
few
friends
but
these
were
all
great
men
said
the
tinker
we
think
so
now
but
in
their
day
they
were
very
much
despised
and
who
was
more
hated
by
the
very
people
he
sought
to
aid
than
christ
by
the
yes
nodded
the
tinker
on
the
contrary
said
i
his
worst
enemies
were
men
of
learning
good
citizens
and
patterns
of
morality
who
looked
upon
him
as
a
dangerous
zealot
threatening
the
destruction
of
the
old
order
of
things
hence
they
killed
him
as
an
agitator
things
are
much
the
same
history
tells
us
that
christ
or
the
spirit
of
christ
has
entered
into
many
men
who
have
striven
to
enlighten
and
better
the
conditions
of
their
kind
and
they
have
generally
met
with
violent
deaths
for
humanity
is
very
gross
and
blind
the
tinker
slowly
wiped
his
upon
the
leg
of
his
breeches
closed
it
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
nevertheless
said
he
at
last
i
am
convinced
that
you
are
a
very
strange
young
man
be
that
as
it
may
said
i
the
bacon
was
delicious
i
have
never
enjoyed
a
meal
so
much
except
once
at
an
inn
called
old
cock
i
know
it
nodded
the
tinker
a
very
poor
house
but
the
ham
and
eggs
are
beyond
praise
said
i
still
my
meal
here
under
the
trees
with
you
will
long
remain
a
pleasant
memory
then
said
the
tinker
young
man
and
i
wish
you
happiness
what
is
happiness
said
i
the
tinker
removed
his
hat
and
having
scratched
his
head
put
it
on
again
happiness
said
he
happiness
is
the
state
of
being
content
with
one
self
the
world
and
everything
in
general
then
said
i
i
fear
i
can
never
be
happy
and
why
not
because
supposing
i
ever
became
contented
with
the
world
and
everything
in
general
which
is
highly
improbable
i
shall
never
never
be
contented
with
myself
chapter
xxiii
concerning
happiness
a
ploughman
and
silver
buttons
now
as
i
went
pondering
on
true
happiness
and
the
nature
of
it
i
beheld
a
man
ploughing
in
a
field
hard
by
and
as
he
ploughed
he
whistled
lustily
and
drawing
near
to
the
field
i
sat
down
upon
a
gate
and
watched
for
there
are
few
sights
and
sounds
i
am
fonder
of
than
the
gleam
of
the
ploughshare
and
the
sighing
whisper
it
makes
as
it
turns
the
fragrant
loam
a
truly
noble
occupation
said
i
to
myself
dignified
by
the
ages
ay
old
well
nigh
as
the
green
earth
itself
no
man
need
be
ashamed
to
guide
a
plough
and
indeed
a
fine
sight
it
made
the
straining
horses
the
stalwart
figure
of
the
ploughman
with
the
blue
sky
the
long
brown
furrows
and
away
and
beyond
the
tender
green
of
leaves
while
the
jingle
of
the
harness
the
clear
merry
whistled
notes
and
the
song
of
a
skylark
high
above
our
heads
all
blended
into
a
chorus
it
was
good
to
hear
as
he
came
up
to
where
i
sat
upon
the
gate
the
ploughman
stopped
and
wiping
the
glistening
moisture
from
his
brow
nodded
a
fine
morning
said
i
so
it
be
sir
now
you
come
to
mention
it
it
do
be
a
fine
day
surely
you
at
least
seem
happy
said
i
happy
he
exclaimed
staring
yes
said
i
well
i
bea
and
why
not
the
ploughman
scratched
his
ear
and
carried
his
glance
from
my
face
up
to
the
sky
and
down
again
i
dunno
he
answered
but
i
bea
yet
you
whistle
gayly
enough
why
a
man
must
do
summat
then
you
seem
strong
and
healthy
yes
i
do
be
fine
an
hearty
and
sleep
well
like
a
blessed
log
and
eat
well
eat
he
exclaimed
with
a
mighty
laugh
lord
i
should
think
so
why
i
always
eatin
or
thinkin
of
it
oh
i
a
fine
eater
i
am
an
i
bea
no
chicken
at
drinkin
neither
then
you
ought
to
be
happy
ah
but
i
bea
he
repeated
shaking
his
head
have
you
any
troubles
none
as
i
can
think
on
you
earn
good
money
every
week
ten
shillin
you
are
not
married
not
me
then
said
i
you
must
be
happy
the
ploughman
pulled
at
his
ear
again
looked
slowly
all
round
the
field
and
finally
shook
his
head
well
said
he
i
bea
but
why
not
his
eye
roved
slowly
up
from
my
boots
to
the
buttons
on
my
coat
them
be
fine
buttons
said
he
do
you
think
so
look
like
silver
they
are
silver
said
i
lord
he
exclaimed
you
would
part
wi
they
buttons
i
suppose
that
depends
on
what
on
how
much
you
would
give
for
them
the
ploughman
thrust
a
hand
into
a
deep
pocket
and
brought
up
five
shillings
i
were
to
buy
a
pair
o
boots
on
my
way
he
explained
but
i
rayther
they
buttons
if
five
shillin
buy
the
boots
would
be
more
serviceable
said
i
maybe
sir
but
then
everybody
wears
boots
but
there
bea
many
as
can
show
buttons
the
like
o
them
so
if
you
willin
lend
me
your
knife
said
i
and
forthwith
i
sawed
off
the
eight
silver
buttons
and
dropped
them
into
his
palm
whereupon
he
handed
me
the
money
with
great
alacrity
and
now
said
i
tell
me
why
you
are
not
happy
well
returned
the
ploughman
back
at
his
ear
again
ye
see
it
as
you
ask
so
i
ca
say
but
if
you
was
to
pass
by
in
a
day
or
two
why
maybe
i
could
tell
ye
so
pocketing
the
buttons
he
whooped
cheerily
to
his
horses
and
plodded
off
whistling
more
merrily
than
ever
chapter
xxiv
which
introduces
the
reader
to
the
ancient
the
sun
was
high
when
i
came
to
a
place
where
the
ways
divided
and
while
i
stood
hesitating
which
road
to
take
i
heard
the
cool
plash
and
murmur
of
a
brook
at
no
great
distance
wherefore
being
hot
and
thirsty
i
scrambled
through
the
hedge
and
coming
to
the
brook
threw
myself
face
down
beside
it
and
catching
up
the
sweet
pure
water
in
my
hands
drank
my
fill
which
done
i
bathed
my
feet
and
hands
and
face
and
became
much
heartened
and
refreshed
thereby
now
because
i
have
ever
loved
the
noise
of
running
waters
in
a
little
while
i
rose
and
walked
on
beside
the
stream
listening
to
its
blithesome
melody
so
by
devious
ways
for
the
brook
wound
prodigiously
i
came
at
length
to
a
sudden
declivity
down
which
the
water
plunged
in
a
miniature
cascade
sparkling
in
the
sun
and
gleaming
with
a
thousand
rainbow
hues
on
i
went
climbing
down
as
best
i
might
until
i
found
myself
in
a
sort
of
green
basin
very
cool
after
the
heat
and
glare
of
the
roads
for
the
high
sides
afforded
much
shade
on
i
went
past
fragrant
thickets
and
bending
willows
with
soft
lush
grass
underfoot
and
leafy
arches
overhead
and
the
brook
singing
and
chattering
at
my
side
albeit
a
brook
of
changeful
mood
now
laughing
and
dimpling
in
some
fugitive
ray
of
sunshine
now
sighing
and
whispering
in
the
shadows
but
ever
moving
upon
its
appointed
way
and
never
quite
silent
so
i
walked
on
beside
the
brook
watching
the
fish
that
showed
like
darting
shadows
on
the
bottom
until
chancing
to
raise
my
eyes
i
stopped
and
there
screened
by
leaves
shut
in
among
the
green
stood
a
small
cottage
or
hut
my
second
glance
showed
it
to
be
tenantless
for
the
thatch
was
partly
gone
the
windows
were
broken
and
the
door
had
long
since
fallen
from
its
hinges
yet
despite
its
forlornness
and
desolation
despite
the
dilapidation
of
broken
door
and
fallen
chimney
there
was
something
in
the
air
of
the
place
that
drew
me
strangely
it
was
somewhat
roughly
put
together
but
still
very
strong
and
seemed
save
for
the
roof
weatherfast
a
man
might
do
worse
than
live
here
thought
i
with
the
birds
for
neighbors
and
the
brook
to
sing
him
to
sleep
at
night
indeed
a
man
might
live
very
happily
in
such
a
place
i
was
still
looking
at
the
hut
with
this
in
my
mind
when
i
was
startled
by
hearing
a
thin
quavering
voice
behind
me
be
you
at
t
cottage
master
turning
sharp
round
i
beheld
a
very
ancient
man
in
a
smock
frock
who
carried
a
basket
on
one
arm
and
leaned
upon
a
stick
yes
i
answered
i
was
wondering
how
it
came
to
be
built
in
such
an
spot
why
were
built
by
a
wanderin
man
o
the
roads
it
very
lonely
said
i
ye
may
well
say
so
sir
haunted
it
be
tu
haunted
said
i
haunted
as
ever
was
answered
the
old
man
with
a
sprightly
nod
strangely
contrasting
with
his
wrinkled
face
and
tremulous
limbs
no
one
ventur
nigh
the
place
arter
dark
an
few
enough
in
the
daytime
for
that
matter
on
account
of
the
ghost
ah
nodded
the
ancient
moans
du
an
likewise
groans
some
as
says
twitters
tu
an
shakes
chains
then
nobody
has
lived
here
of
late
bless
no
nor
would

not
if
ye
paid

come
the
place

may
say
since

built
by
the
man

alone

said
i

the

but

so
at
last
i
lifted
the
latch
here
the
ancient
paused
to
draw
a
from
his
pocket
with
great
deliberation
noting
my
awakened
interest
with
a
twinkling
eye
well
i
inquired
well
he
continued
slowly
i
lifted
th
latch
an
give
a
push
to
the
door

it
would
only

little
way

were
this
wanderin
man
o

exclaimed
rising
with
some
little
difficulty
and
hobbling
into
the
hut
theer
be
th
very
stapil
so
it
be
and
he
pointed
up
to
a
rusty
iron
staple
that
had
been
driven
deep
into
the
beam
above
the
door
and
why
said
i
why
did
he
hang
himself
seein
e
no
friends
and
never
told
nobody
nobody
never
knowed
answered
the
old
man
shaking
his
head
but
on
that
theer
stapil
an
on
that
theer
stapil
i
fund
on
a
stormy
night
sixty
and
six
year
ago

wonderful
memory
said
i
ay
to
be
sure
a
wunnerful
a
wunnerful
sixty
and
six
years

an
age
said
i
so
it
be
nodded
the
ancient
i
were
a
fine
young
chap
in
those
days
tall
i
were
an
straight
as
a
arrer
i
be
a
bit
different
now
why

said
i
so
t
stapil
yonder
but
t
stapil
looks
nigh
as
good
as
ever
iron
generally
wears
better
than
flesh
and
blood
said
i
it
only
natural
ay
but
ca
last
forever
said
the
ancient
frowning
and
shaking
his
head
at
the
rusty
staple
i
watched
un
month
in
month
out
all
these
years
an
seen
un
growin
rustier
an
rustier
i
last
out
yet
i
said
to
un

it
heerd
me
many
an
many
a
time
last
out
yet
i
said
an
so
i
will
to
ca
last
forever
an
i
be
a
man
a
mortal
man
bea
i
wonderfully
said
i
an
so
strong
as
a
bull
to
be
sure
an
t
stapil
ca
last
much
longer
eh
maister
so
old
an
rusty
as
be
one
would
hardly
think
so
not
so
long
as
a
man
like
i
be
he
inquired
with
a
certain
wistful
appeal
in
his
eyes
no
i
answered
impulsively
i
knowed
it
i
knowed
it
he
chuckled
feebly
brandishing
his
stick
such
a
poor
old
stapil
as
is
all
eat
up
wi
rust
every
time
i
come
watercress
i
come
in
an
give
un
a
look
an
watch
un
rustin
away
an
rustin
away
i
see
un
go
fust
arter
all
so
i
will
and
with
another
nod
at
the
staple
he
turned
and
hobbled
out
into
the
sunshine
and
seeing
how
despite
his
brave
showing
he
labored
to
carry
the
heavy
basket
i
presently
took
it
from
him
disregarding
his
protests
and
set
off
by
his
side
yet
as
we
went
i
turned
once
to
look
back
at
the
deserted
hut
you
thinkin
is
a
bad
place
at
night
said
the
old
man
on
the
contrary
i
answered
i
was
thinking
it
might
suit
a
homeless
man
like
me
very
well
indeed
d
mean
to
live
there
exclaimed
the
ancient
yes
said
i
then
you
bea
afraid
o
the
ghost
no
i
answered
you
be
one
o
they
fules
as
think
theer
bea
no
ghosts
as
to
that
i
answered
i
do
know
but
i
do
think
i
should
be
much
afraid
and
it
is
a
great
blessing
to
have
some
spot
on
this
unfriendly
world
that
we
can
call
even
though
it
be
but
a
hut
and
haunted
in
a
little
while
the
path
we
followed
led
up
a
somewhat
steep
ascent
which
though
not
so
precipitous
as
the
place
where
i
had
entered
the
hollow
was
a
difficult
climb
notwithstanding
seeing
which
i
put
out
a
hand
to
aid
my
aged
companion
but
he
repulsed
me
almost
sharply
let
be
he
panted
let
be
nobody
never
me
up
this
path
an
nobody
never
shall
so
up
we
went
the
ancient
and
i
side
by
side
and
very
slowly
until
the
summit
being
reached
he
seated
himself
spent
and
breathless
upon
a
fallen
tree
which
had
doubtless
served
this
purpose
many
times
before
and
mopped
at
his
wrinkled
brow
with
a
trembling
hand
ye
see
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
breath
sufficiently
ye
see
i
be
wunnerful
spry
an
active
could
dance
ye
a
hornpipe
any
day
if
i
was
so
minded

ninety

an
him
my
own
brother
saying
which
the
ancient
rose
and
we
went
on
together
side
by
side
towards
sissinghurst
village
chapter
xxv
of
black
george
the
smith
and
how
we
threw
the
hammer
the
bull
is
a
plain
square
whitewashed
building
with
a
sloping
roof
and
before
the
door
an
open
portico
wherein
are
set
two
seats
on
which
one
may
sit
of
a
sunny
afternoon
with
a
mug
of
ale
at
one
elbow
and
watch
the
winding
road
the
thatched
cottages
bowered
in
roses
or
the
quiver
of
distant
trees
where
the
red
conical
roof
of
some
makes
a
vivid
note
of
color
amid
the
green
or
one
may
close
one
eyes
and
hark
to
the
chirp
of
the
swallows
under
the
eaves
the
distant
lowing
of
cows
or
the
clink
of
hammers
from
the
smithy
across
the
way
and
presently
as
we
sat
there
drowsing
in
the
sun
to
us
came
one
from
the
tap
a
fellow
small
of
eye
and
nose
but
great
of
jaw
albeit
he
was
become
somewhat
fat
and
fleshy
who
having
nodded
to
me
sat
him
down
beside
the
ancient
and
addressed
him
as
follows

jarge

ah

the
ancient
shaking
his
head

seemed
goin
on
all
quiet
and
though
said
the
man
whom
i
discovered
to
be
the
landlord
of
the
bull
seemed
nice
and
quiet
and
nothin

o
the
way
when
an
hour
ago
it
were
ups
and
heaves
sam
out
into

the
old
man

his
head

simon
as

generally
about
the
twentieth
o
the
month

simon

innkeeper

do
i
inquired
oh

mighty
glad
to

so
easy
sam
must
be
a
very
remarkable
fellow
undoubtedly
a
philosopher
said
i
be
nowt
to
look
at
said
the
ancient
now
at
this
moment
there
came
a
sudden
deep
bellow
a
hoarse
roar
from
somewhere
near
by
and
looking
round
in
some
perplexity
through
the
wide
doorway
of
the
smithy
opposite
i
saw
a
man
come
tumbling
all
arms
and
legs
who
having
described
a
somersault
fell
rolled
over
once
or
twice
and
sitting
up
in
the
middle
of
the
road
stared
about
him
in
a
dazed
sort
of
fashion
that
job
nodded
the
ancient
poor
fellow
said
i
and
rose
to
go
to
his
assistance
oh
that
were
nothin
said
the
ancient
laying
a
restraining
hand
upon
my
arm
nothin
at
all
job
bea
why

seen

further
nor
that
afore
now
but
y
see
job
be
pretty
heavy
handlin
even
for
black
jarge
and
in
a
little
while
job
arose
from
where
he
sat
in
the
dust
and
limping
up
sat
himself
down
on
the
opposite
bench
very
black
of
brow
and
fierce
of
eye
and
after
he
had
sat
there
silent
for
maybe
five
minutes
i
said
that
i
hoped
he
was
hurt
he
repeated
with
a
blank
stare
should
i
be
why
you
seemed
to
fall
rather
heavily
said
i
at
this
job
regarded
me
with
a
look
half
resentful
half
reproachful
and
immediately
turned
his
back
upon
me
from
which
and
sundry
winks
and
nods
and
shakes
of
the
head
from
the
others
it
seemed
that
my
remark
had
been
and
after
we
had
sat
silent
for
maybe
another
five
minutes
the
ancient
appeared
to
notice
job
presence
for
the
first
time
why

inquired
solemnly

my
ale
i

exclaimed
job
staring
in
amazement
as

also
the
other

i

said
simon
on
the
contrary
i
returned

a
little
bodily
risk
and
satisfy
one
hunger
rather
than
lie
safe
but
famishing
beneath
some
hedge
or
rick
what
do
you
think
ancient
the
old
man
leaned
forward
and
peered
up
at
me
sharply
beneath
his
hanging
brows
well
said
i
you
right
he
nodded
and
a
man
wi
eyes
the
like
o
yourn
one
as
is
easy
to
turn
aside
even
though
it
do
be
black
jarge
as

then
said
job
as
i
took
up
my
staff
if
your
back
broke
my
chap
why
do
go
for
to
blame
me
that
all
you

cocksure
ah
that
you
be
i
thinkin
black
jarge
would
find
this
chap
a
bit
different

remarked
the
ancient
what
do
think
simon
looks
as
if
might
take
a
good
blow
ah
and
give
one
for
that
matter
returned
the
innkeeper
studying
me
with
eyes
and
his
head
to
one
side
as
i
have
seen
artists
look
at
pictures
he
be
pretty
wide
in
the
shoulders
and
full
in
the
chest
and
by
the
look
of
him
quick
on
pins
you
been
a
fightin
man
simon
and
you
ought
to
know
but
got
summat
better
still
and
what
might
that
be
gaffer
inquired
the
innkeeper
a
good
straight
bright
eye
simon
wi
a
look
in
it
as
says
will
ah
but
what
o
jarge
cried
job
black
jarge
do
mind
a
eyes
to
black
frequent
do
mind
nothin
nor
nobody
job
said
the
ancient
tapping
his
theer
some
things
as
is
better
nor
gert
big
muscles
and
gert
strong
fists
if
you
a
danged
fule
you
know
what
i
mean
young
man
he
went
on
turning
to
me
you
puts
me
in
mind
o
what
i
were
at
your
age
though
to
be
sure
i
were
taller
you
by
about
five
or
six
inches
maybe
more
but
do
go
for
to
be
too
for
all
that
black
jarge
are
to
be
sneezed
at
and
if
you
must
un
added
the
innkeeper
why
go
for
the
chin
theer
are
a
better
place
to
a
man
than
on
the
chin
if
so
be
you
can
thump
it
right
and
enough
i
mind
was
so
i
put
out
tom
brock
o
bedford
a
sweet
pretty
blow
it
were
too
though
i
do
say
it
thank
you
said
i
should
it
come
to
fighting
which
heaven
forfend
i
shall
certainly
remember
your
advice
saying
which
i
turned
away
and
crossed
the
road
to
the
open
door
of
the
smithy
very
conscious
of
the
three
pairs
of
eyes
that
watched
me
as
i
went
upon
the
threshold
of
the
forge
i
paused
to
look
about
me
and
there
sure
enough
was
the
smith
indeed
a
fine
big
fellow
he
was
with
great
shoulders
and
a
mighty
chest
and
arms
whose
bulging
muscles
showed
to
advantage
in
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
in
his
left
hand
he
grasped
a
pair
of
tongs
wherein
was
set
a
glowing
iron
scroll
upon
which
he
beat
with
the
hammer
in
his
right
i
stood
watching
until
having
beaten
out
the
glow
from
the
iron
he
plunged
the
scroll
back
into
the
fire
and
fell
to
blowing
with
the
bellows
but
now
as
i
looked
more
closely
at
him
i
almost
doubted
if
this
could
be
black
george
after
all
for
this
man
hair
was
of
a
bright
gold
and
curled
in
tight
rings
upon
his
brow
while
instead
of
the
black
scowling
visage
i
had
expected
i
beheld
a
ruddy
open
face
out
of
which
looked
a
pair
of
eyes
of
a
blue
you
may
sometimes
see
in
a
summer
sky
at
evening
and
yet
again
his
massive
size
would
seem
to
proclaim
him
the
famous
black
george
and
no
other
it
was
with
something
of
doubt
in
my
mind
nevertheless
that
i
presently
stepped
into
the
smithy
and
accosted
him
are
you
black
george
i
inquired
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
he
let
go
the
handle
of
the
bellows
and
turned
as
i
watched
i
saw
his
brows
draw
suddenly
together
while
the
golden
hairs
of
his
beard
seemed
to
curl
upward
suppose
i
be
then
i
wish
to
speak
with
you
be
that
what
you
come
for
yes
be
you
come
far
yes
that
a
pity
why
you
a
good
way
to
go
back
again
what
do
you
mean
well
for
one
thing
i
means
as
i
do
like
your
looks
my
chap
and
why
do
you
like
my
looks
lord
exclaimed
the
smith
should
i
know
but
i
do
of
that
i
sartin
sure
which
reminds
me
said
i
of
a
certain
unpopular
gentleman
of
the
name
of
fell
or
pell
or
snell
eh
said
the
smith
staring
there
is
a
verse
i
remember
which
runs
i
think
in
this
wise
do
not
love
thee
doctor
fell
or
pell
or
snell
for
reasons
which
i
can
not
tell
but
this
i
know
and
know
full
well
i
do
not
love
thee
doctor
fell
or
pell
or
snell
so
you
a
poet
eh
no
said
i
shaking
my
head
then
i
sorry
for
it
a
man
do
meet
wi
poets
every
day
saying
which
he
drew
the
scroll
from
the
fire
and
laid
it
glowing
upon
the
anvil
you
was
wishful
to
speak
wi
me
i
think
he
inquired
yes
i
answered
ah
the
smith
to
be
sure
and
forthwith
began
to
sing
most
lustily
marking
the
time
very
cleverly
with
his
ponderous
if
i
began
a
little
put
out
at
this
if
you
will
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
but
he
only
hammered
away
harder
than
ever
and
roared
his
song
the
louder
and
though
it
sounded
ill
enough
at
the
time
it
was
a
song
i
came
to
know
well
later
the
words
of
which
are
these
strike
ding
ding
strike
ding
ding
the
iron
glows
and
loveth
good
blows
as
fire
doth
bellows
strike
ding
ding
now
seeing
he
was
determined
to
give
me
no
chance
to
speak
i
presently
seated
myself
close
by
and
fell
to
singing
likewise
oddly
enough
the
only
thing
i
could
recall
on
the
moment
was
the
tinker
song
and
that
but
very
imperfectly
yet
it
served
my
purpose
well
enough
thus
we
fell
to
it
with
a
will
the
different
notes
clashing
and
filling
the
air
with
a
most
vile
discord
and
the
words
all
jumbled
up
together
something
in
this
wise
strike
ding
ding
a
tinker
i
am
o
strike
ding
ding
a
tinker
am
i
the
iron
it
glows
a
tinker
i
live
and
loveth
good
blows
and
a
tinker
i
die
as
fire
doth
bellows
if
the
king
in
his
crown
strike
ding
ding
would
change
places
with
me
strike
ding
ding
and
so
forth
the
louder
he
roared
the
louder
roared
i
until
the
place
fairly
rang
with
the
din
in
so
much
that
chancing
to
look
through
the
open
doorway
i
saw
the
ancient
with
simon
job
and
several
others
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
staring
as
well
they
might
but
still
the
smith
and
i
continued
to
howl
at
each
other
with
unabated
vigor
until
he
stopped
all
at
once
and
threw
down
his
hammer
with
a
clang
dang
me
if
i
like
that
voice
o
yourn
he
exclaimed
why
to
be
sure
i
do
sing
very
often
i
answered
which
i
mean
to
say
is
a
very
good
thing
ah
a
very
good
thing
nor
do
i
pretend
to
sing
then
why
do
try
now
for
company
sake
well
i
do
like
it
i
enough
of
it
then
said
i
suppose
you
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
not
by
no
manner
o
means
then
what
do
you
propose
to
do
why
said
the
smith
rising
and
stretching
himself
since
you
ax
me
i
to
pitch
you
out
o
yon
door
you
may
try
of
course
said
i
measuring
the
distance
between
us
with
my
eye
but
if
you
do
seeing
you
are
so
much
the
bigger
and
stronger
man
i
shall
certainly
fetch
you
a
knock
with
this
staff
of
mine
which
i
think
you
will
remember
for
many
a
day
so
saying
i
rose
and
stepped
out
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
black
george
eyed
me
slowly
up
from
the
soles
of
my
boots
to
the
crown
of
my
hat
and
down
again
picked
up
his
hammer
in
an
undecided
fashion
looked
it
over
as
if
he
had
never
seen
such
a
thing
before
tossed
it
into
a
corner
and
seating
himself
on
the
anvil
folded
his
arms
all
at
once
a
merry
twinkle
leapt
into
the
blue
depths
of
his
eyes
and
i
saw
the
swift
gleam
of
a
smile
what
do
want
man
said
he
now
hereupon
with
a
sudden
gesture
i
pitched
my
staff
out
through
the
open
doorway
into
the
road
and
folded
my
arms
across
my
chest
even
as
he
why
did
do
that
he
inquired
staring
because
i
do
think
i
shall
need
it
after
all
but
suppose
i
was
to
come
for
now
but
you
wo
you
be
a
strange
sort
o
chap
said
he
shaking
his
head
so
they
tell
me
and
what
does
the
likes
o
you
want
wi
the
likes
o
me
work
know
anythin
about
smithin
not
a
thing
then
why
do
come
to
learn
more
fool
you
said
the
smith
why
because
smithin
is
work
and
dirty
work
and
hot
work
and
work
as
is
badly
paid
nowadays
then
why
are
you
a
smith
my
feyther
was
a
smith
afore
me
and
is
that
your
only
reason
my
only
reason
then
you
are
the
greater
fool
you
think
so
do
ye
certainly
supposin
said
black
george
stroking
his
golden
beard
reflectively
supposin
i
was
to
get
up
and
break
your
neck
for
that
then
you
would
at
least
save
me
from
the
folly
of
becoming
a
smith
i
do
said
black
george
shaking
his
head
no
i
do
not
like
you
i
am
sorry
for
that
because
he
went
on
you
got
the
gift
o
the
gab
and
a
gabbing
man
is
worse
than
a
gabbing
woman
you
can
gab
your
share
if
it
comes
to
that
said
i
can
i
you
can
my
chap
he
growled
holding
up
a
warning
hand
go
easy
now
go
easy
do
get
me
took
again
not
if
i
can
help
it
i
returned
i
be
a
quiet
soul
till
i
gets
took
a
very
quiet
soul
lambs
quieter
but
i
wo
answer
for
that
neck
o
yourn
if
i
do
get
took
so
look
out
i
understand
you
have
an
important
piece
of
work
on
hand
said
i
changing
the
subject
th
owd
church
screen
yes
and
are
in
need
of
a
helper
ah
to
be
sure
but
you
are
got
the
look
o
a
workin
cove
i
never
see
a
workin
cove
wi
the
like
o
yourn
so
white
as
a
they
be
i
have
worked
hard
enough
in
my
time
nevertheless
said
i
what
might
you
done
now
i
have
translated
petronius
arbiter
also
quintilian
with
a
literal
rendering
into
the
english
of
the
memoires
of
the
sieur
de
brantome
oh
exclaimed
the
smith
that
sounds
a
lot
anything
more
yes
i
answered
i
won
the
high
jump
and
throwing
the
hammer
throwin
th
repeated
black
george
musingly
was
it
anything
like
that
theer
and
he
pointed
to
a
sledge
near
by
something
i
answered
and
you
want
work
i
do
tell
what
my
fellow
if
you
can
throw
that
theer
further
nor
me
then
i
say
and
you
can
name
your
own
wages
but
if
i
beat
you
and
i
fair
sure
i
can
then
you
must
stand
up
to
me
for
ten
minutes
and
i
give
a
good
trouncin
to
ease
my
mind
what
d
say
after
a
momentary
hesitation
i
nodded
my
head
done
said
i
more
fool
you
grinned
the
smith
and
catching
up
his
he
strode
out
into
the
road
before
the
bull
a
small
crowd
had
gathered
all
newly
come
from
field
or
farmyard
for
most
of
them
carried
rake
or
pitchfork
having
doubtless
been
drawn
thither
by
the
hellish
outcry
of
black
george
and
myself
now
i
noticed
that
while
they
listened
to
the
ancient
who
was
holding
forth
in
hand
yet
every
eye
was
turned
towards
the
smithy
and
in
every
eye
was
expectation
at
our
appearance
however
i
thought
they
seemed
one
and
all
vastly
surprised
and
taken
aback
for
heads
were
shaken
and
glances
wandered
from
the
smith
and
myself
to
the
ancient
and
back
again
well
i
be
danged
exclaimed
job
i
knowed
it
i
knowed
it
cried
the
ancient
rubbing
his
hands
and
chuckling
knowed
what
gaffer
inquired
black
george
as
we
came
up
why
i
knowed
as
this
young
chap
would
come
out
his
own
two
legs
and
not
like
job
and
in
the
dust
th
road
like
a
hog
why
y
see
gaffer
began
the
smith
almost
apologetically
it
seemed
to
me
it
do
come
sort
o
to
heave
the
likes
o
job
about
a
bit
job
made
for
it
y
might
say
but
this
chap
different
so
be
jarge
so
be
nodded
the
ancient
though
mark
me
gaffer
i
are
nohow
in
love
wi
this
chap
neither
gabs
too
much
to
suit
me
by
a
long
sight
do
that
chimed
in
job
edging
nearer
what
i
sez
is
if
do
get
back
broke
are
got
nobody
to
blame
but
so
cocksure
as
be
job
said
the
ancient
hold
thee
tongue
i
sez
a
cocksure
cove
repeated
job
doggedly
an
a
cocksure
cove
be
what
do
think
jarge
job
returned
the
smith
i
do
chuck
a
man
into
t
road
and
talk
wi
both
in
the
same
day
in
this
conversation
i
bore
no
part
busying
myself
in
drawing
out
a
wide
circle
in
the
dust
a
proceeding
watched
by
the
others
with
much
interest
and
not
a
few
wondering
comments
what
be
goin
to
du
wi
jarge
inquired
the
ancient
why
explained
the
smith
this
chap
thinks
can
throw
it
further
nor
me
at
this
there
was
a
general
laugh
if
so
be
can
pursued
black
george
then
comes
to
work
for
me
at
own
price
but
if
i
beat
then
must
stand
up
to
me
wi
fists
for
ten
minutes
ten
minutes
cried
a
voice
wo
last
five
see
if
do
feel
sorry
for
un
said
a
second
do
be
so
pale
as
a
sheet
so
would
you
be
if
you
was
in
shoes
chimed
in
a
third
whereat
there
was
a
general
laugh
indeed
as
i
looked
round
the
ring
of
grinning
unresponsive
faces
it
was
plain
to
see
that
all
sympathy
was
against
the
stranger
as
is
the
way
of
bird
beast
fish
but
especially
man
the
world
over
and
i
experienced
a
sudden
sense
of
loneliness
which
was
i
think
only
natural
yet
as
i
put
up
my
hand
to
loose
the
strap
of
my
knapsack
i
encountered
another
already
there
and
turning
beheld
simon
the
innkeeper
if
it
do
come
to
fightin
he
whispered
close
in
my
ear
if
it
do
come
to
fightin
and
i
fair
sure
it
will
keep
away
as
much
as
you
can
you
look
quick
on
your
pins
moreover
whatever
you
do
watch
right
and
when
you
do
see
a
chance
to
strike
go
for
chin
a
little
to
one
side
and
strike
danged
many
thanks
for
your
friendly
advice
said
i
with
a
grateful
nod
and
slipping
off
my
coat
would
have
handed
it
to
him
but
that
the
ancient
hobbled
up
and
taking
it
from
me
folded
it
ostentatiously
across
his
arm
mark
my
words
simon
said
he
this
young
chap
is
as
like
what
i
were
at
his
age
as
one
pea
is
to
another
i
says
so
and
i
means
so
come
said
black
george
at
this
juncture
i
work
waitin
to
be
done
and
my
forge
fire
will
be
out
i
quite
ready
said
i
stepping
forward
it
was
now
arranged
that
standing
alternately
within
the
circle
we
should
each
have
three
throws
whoever
should
make
the
two
best
throws
to
win
hereupon
the
smith
took
his
place
within
the
circle
hammer
in
hand
wait
said
i
the
advantage
usually
lies
with
the
last
thrower
it
would
be
fairer
to
you
were
we
to
toss
for
it
no
answered
black
george
motioning
the
onlookers
to
stand
back
i
got
th
and
i
throw
first
now
as
probably
every
one
knows
it
is
one
thing
to
swing
a
in
the
ordinary
way
but
quite
another
to
throw
it
any
distance
for
there
is
required
beside
the
bodily
strength
a
certain
amount
of
knowledge
without
which
a
man
is
necessarily
handicapped
thus
despite
my
opponent
great
strength
of
arm
i
was
fairly
sanguine
of
the
result
black
george
took
a
fresh
grip
upon
the
twirled
it
lightly
above
his
head
swung
it
once
twice
thrice
and
let
it
go
with
a
shout
job
and
two
or
three
others
ran
down
the
road
to
mark
where
it
had
fallen
and
presently
returned
pacing
out
the
distance
they
announced
can
beat
that
inquired
black
george
complacently
i
think
i
can
i
answered
as
taking
up
the
hammer
i
in
turn
stepped
into
the
ring
gripping
the
shaft
firmly
i
whirled
it
aloft
and
began
to
swing
it
swifter
and
swifter
gaining
greater
impetus
every
moment
till
like
a
flash
it
flew
from
my
grasp
panting
i
watched
it
rise
rise
rise
and
then
plunge
down
to
earth
in
a
smother
of
dust
beat
it
cried
the
ancient
flourishing
his
stick
excitedly
lord
love
me
beat
it
ay
beat
it
said
a
man
who
carried
a
rake
that
was
forever
getting
in
everybody
way
an
by
a
goodish
bit
to
shouted
another
ah
but
jarge
are
got
arm
in
yet
retorted
a
third
jarge
can
do
better
nor
that
by
a
long
sight
but
now
all
voices
were
hushed
as
job
paced
up
he
announced
black
george
looked
hard
at
me
but
without
speaking
stepped
sulkily
into
the
ring
moistened
his
palms
looked
at
me
again
and
seizing
the
hammer
began
to
whirl
it
as
he
had
seen
me
round
and
round
it
went
faster
and
faster
till
with
a
sudden
lurch
he
hurled
it
up
and
away
indeed
it
was
a
mighty
throw
straight
and
strong
it
flew
describing
a
wide
parabola
ere
it
thudded
into
the
road
the
excitement
now
waxed
high
and
many
started
off
to
measure
the
distance
for
themselves
shouting
one
to
another
as
they
went
as
for
the
smith
he
stood
beside
me
whistling
and
i
saw
that
the
twinkle
was
back
in
his
eyes
again
one
hunner
and
twenty
cried
voices
and
a
half
corrected
job
thrusting
the
hammer
into
my
hand
and
grinning
can
beat
that
inquired
black
george
again
ay
can
beat
that
echoed
the
crowd
it
was
a
marvellous
throw
said
i
shaking
my
head
and
indeed
in
my
heart
i
knew
i
could
never
hope
to
equal
much
less
beat
such
a
mighty
cast
i
therefore
decided
on
strategy
and
with
this
in
mind
proceeded
in
a
leisurely
fashion
once
more
to
mark
out
the
circle
which
was
obliterated
in
places
to
flatten
the
surface
underfoot
to
roll
up
my
sleeves
and
tighten
my
belt
in
fine
i
observed
all
such
precautions
as
a
man
might
be
expected
to
take
before
some
supreme
effort
at
length
having
done
everything
i
could
think
of
to
impress
this
idea
upon
the
onlookers
i
took
up
the
hammer
means
to
do
it
this
time
cried
the
man
with
the
rake
knocking
off
job
hat
in
his
excitement
as
with
a
tremendous
swing
i
made
my
second
throw
there
was
a
moment
breathless
silence
as
the
hammer
hurtled
through
the
air
then
like
an
echo
to
its
fall
came
a
shout
of
laughter
for
the
distance
was
palpably
far
short
of
the
giant
smith
last
a
moment
later
job
came
pacing
up
and
announced
hereupon
arose
a
very
babel
of
voices
you
got
un
beat
jarge
well
i
knowed
it
from
the
start
let
un
alone
cried
simon
got
another
chance
yet
much
good
it
do
ah
might
as
well
give
in
now
and
take
thrashin
and
ha
done
it
that
my
ruse
had
succeeded
with
the
crowd
was
evident
they
to
a
man
believed
i
had
done
my
best
and
already
regarded
me
as
hopelessly
beaten
my
chance
of
winning
depended
upon
whether
the
smith
deluded
into
a
like
belief
should
content
himself
with
just
beating
my
last
throw
for
should
he
again
exert
his
mighty
strength
to
the
uttermost
i
felt
that
my
case
was
indeed
hopeless
it
was
with
a
beating
heart
therefore
that
i
watched
him
take
his
place
for
the
last
throw
his
face
wore
a
confident
smile
but
nevertheless
he
took
up
the
hammer
with
such
a
businesslike
air
that
my
heart
sank
and
feeling
a
touch
upon
my
arm
i
was
glad
to
turn
away
i
be
goin
to
fetch
a
sponge
and
water
said
simon
a
sponge
and
water
ah
likewise
some
vinegar
theer
nothin
like
and
remember
the
chin
a
little
to
one
side
preferred
so
then
you
think
i
shall
be
beaten
why
i
do
say
that
but
it
best
to
be
prepared
are
it
now
and
with
a
friendly
nod
the
innkeeper
turned
away
in
that
same
minute
there
arose
another
shout
from
the
crowd
as
they
greeted
black
george
last
throw
and
job
striding
up
announced
then
while
the
air
still
echoed
with
their
plaudits
i
stepped
into
the
ring
and
catching
up
the
hammer
swung
it
high
above
my
head
and
at
the
full
length
of
my
arms
began
to
wheel
it
the
iron
spun
faster
and
faster
till
setting
my
teeth
with
the
whole
force
of
every
fibre
every
nerve
and
muscle
of
my
body
i
let
it
fly
the
blood
was
throbbing
at
my
temples
and
my
breath
coming
fast
as
i
watched
its
curving
flight
and
now
all
voices
were
hushed
so
that
the
ring
of
the
iron
could
be
plainly
heard
as
it
struck
the
hard
road
and
all
eyes
watched
job
as
he
began
pacing
towards
us
as
he
drew
nearer
i
could
hear
him
counting
to
himself
thus
one
hundred
one
hundred
and
one
one
hundred
and
two
one
hundred
and
two
next
moment
as
it
seemed
to
me
an
inarticulate
ancient
was
desperately
trying
to
force
me
into
my
coat
wrong
side
first
and
simon
was
shaking
my
hand
you
tricked
me
cried
a
voice
and
turning
i
found
black
george
confronting
me
with
clenched
fists
and
how
did
i
trick
you
i
could
ha
chucked
farther
nor
that
then
why
did
you
because
i
thought
you
was
beat
i
say
you
tricked
me
and
i
tell
you
the
match
was
a
fair
one
from
start
to
finish
put
up
your
hands
said
the
smith
advancing
in
a
threatening
manner
no
said
i
a
bargain
is
a
bargain
and
turning
my
back
upon
him
i
fell
to
watching
the
man
with
the
rake
who
not
content
with
word
was
busily
pacing
out
the
distance
for
himself
put
up
your
hands
repeated
black
george
hoarsely
for
the
last
time
no
said
i
over
my
shoulder
strike
me
if
you
will
i
went
on
seeing
him
raise
his
fist
i
shall
not
defend
myself
but
i
tell
you
this
black
george
the
first
blow
you
strike
will
brand
you
coward
and
no
honest
man
coward
is
it
cried
he
and
with
the
word
had
seized
me
in
a
grip
that
crushed
my
flesh
and
nigh
swung
me
off
my
feet
coward
is
it
he
repeated
yes
said
i
none
but
a
coward
would
attack
an
unresisting
man
so
for
a
full
minute
we
stood
thus
staring
into
each
other
eyes
and
once
again
i
saw
the
hairs
of
his
golden
beard
curl
up
and
outwards
what
would
have
been
the
end
i
can
not
say
but
there
came
upon
the
stillness
the
sound
of
flying
footsteps
the
crowd
was
burst
asunder
and
a
girl
stood
before
us
a
tall
handsome
girl
with
raven
hair
and
great
flashing
black
eyes
oh
you
jarge
think
shame
on
yourself
think
shame
on
yourself
black
jarge
look
she
cried
pointing
a
finger
at
him
look
at
the
great
strong
man
as
is
a
coward
i
felt
the
smith
grip
relax
his
arms
dropped
to
his
sides
while
a
deep
red
glow
crept
up
his
cheeks
till
it
was
lost
in
the
clustering
curls
of
gleaming
yellow
hair
why
prue
he
began
in
a
strangely
altered
voice
and
stopped
the
fire
was
gone
from
his
eyes
as
they
rested
upon
her
and
he
made
a
movement
as
though
he
would
have
reached
out
his
hand
to
her
but
checked
himself
why
prue
he
said
again
but
choked
suddenly
and
turning
away
strode
back
towards
his
forge
without
another
word
on
he
went
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
and
i
thought
there
was
something
infinitely
woebegone
and
pitiful
in
the
droop
of
his
head
now
as
i
looked
from
his
forlorn
figure
to
the
beautiful
flushed
face
of
the
girl
i
saw
her
eyes
grow
wonderfully
soft
and
sweet
and
brim
over
with
tears
and
when
black
george
had
betaken
himself
back
to
his
smithy
she
also
turned
and
crossing
swiftly
to
the
inn
vanished
through
its
open
doorway
she
a
fine
sperrit
that
darter
o
yourn
simon

cottage

what
i
saw

think

very
well
but
the
ghost

the
old
man

uneasily

the
innkeeper

went
down
into
th
one
evenin
six
months
ago
wi
black
jarge

a
mind
to
knock

the
ghost
that
way
well
jarge
ups
wi
and
down
comes
the
rotten
old
door
a
crash
jarge
strung
up
for
another
blow
when
all
at
once
theer
comes
a
scream
here
simon
shivered
involuntarily
and
glanced
uneasily
over
his
shoulder
and
round
the
room
a
scream
said
i
ah
nodded
simon
but
worse
nor
that
here
he
paused
again
and
looking
closer
at
him
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
his
broad
strong
hands
were
shaking
and
that
his
brow
glistened
with
moisture
what
was
it
like
i
inquired
struck
by
this
apparent
weakness
in
one
so
hardy
and
full
of
health
a
scream
wi
a
bubble
in
it
he
answered
speaking
with
an
effort
like
somebody
shriekin
out
wi
throat
choked
up
wi
blood
jarge
and
me
did
wait
for
no
more
we
run
and
as
we
run
it
follered
groanin
arter
us
till
we
was
out
upon
the
road
and
then
it
shrieked
at
us
from
the
bushes
ecod
it
do
make
me
cold
to
talk
of
it
even
now
jarge
left
best
sledge
and
i
my
crowbar
and
we
never
went
back
for
them
nor
never
shall
no
here
simon
paused
to
mop
the
grizzled
hair
at
his
temples
i
tell
peter
that
place
are
fit
for
no
man
at
night
if
so
be
lookin
for
a
bed
my
chap
theer
one
you
can

bull
ready
and
willin
an
gratus
added
the
ancient
tapping
his
snuffbox
thank
you
said
i
both
of
you
for
the
offer
but
i
have
a
strange
fancy
to
hear
and
if
possible
see
this
ghost
for
myself
do
du
it
admonished
the
ancient
so
dark
an
lonesome
as
it
be
do
du
it
peter
why
ancient
said
i
it
is
that
i
doubt
your
word
but
my
mind
is
set
on
the
adventure
so
if
simon
will
let
me
have
threepenny
worth
of
candles
and
some
bread
and
meat
no
matter
what
i
be
off
for
i
should
like
to
get
there
before
dusk
nodding
gloomily
simon
rose
and
went
out
whereupon
the
ancient
leaned
over
and
laid
a
yellow
clawlike
hand
upon
my
arm
peter
said
he
peter
i
took
to
you
amazin
just
a
few
inches
taller
say
a
couple
an
you
be
the
very
spit
o
what
i
were
at
your
age
the
very
spit
thank
you
ancient
said
i
laying
my
hand
on
his
now
peter
be
a
hijious
thing
a
very
hijious
thing
if
when
i
come
watercress
in
the
marnin
i
should
find
you
on
t
stapil
cold
and
stiff
like
t
other
or
lyin
a
corp
wi
your
throat
cut
be
a
hijious
hijious
thing
peter
but
oh
mak
a
fine
story
in
the
tellin
in
a
little
while
simon
returned
with
the
candles
a
and
a
parcel
of
bread
and
meat
for
which
he
gloomily
but
persistently
refused
payment
last
of
all
he
produced
a
small
pistol
which
he
insisted
on
my
taking
not
as
it
be
much
use
again
a
ghost
said
he
with
a
gloomy
shake
of
the
head
but
a
pistol
a
comfortable
thing
to
in
a
lonely
place
if
that
place
be
very
dark
which
last
if
something
illogical
may
be
none
the
less
true
so
having
shaken
each
by
the
hand
i
bade
them
good
night
and
set
off
along
the
darkening
road
chapter
xxvii
which
tells
how
and
in
what
manner
i
saw
the
ghost
now
as
i
went
my
mind
was
greatly
exercised
as
to
a
feasible
explanation
of
what
i
had
just
heard
that
a
man
so
old
as
the
ancient
should
see
things
i
could
readily
believe
by
reason
of
his
years
for
great
age
is
often
subject
to
such
hallucinations
but
with
simon
a
man
in
the
prime
of
his
life
it
was
a
different
matter
altogether
that
he
had
been
absolutely
sincere
in
his
story
i
had
read
in
his
dilating
eye
and
the
involuntary
shiver
that
had
passed
over
him
while
he
spoke
here
indeed
though
i
scouted
all
idea
of
supernatural
agency
there
lay
a
mystery
that
piqued
my
curiosity
not
a
little
ghosts
pshaw
what
being
endowed
with
a
reasoning
mind
could
allow
himself
to
think
let
alone
believe
in
such
folly
ghosts
sir
yet
here
and
all
at
once
like
an
enemy
from
the
dark
old
stories
leaped
at
and
seized
me
by
the
throat
old
tales
of
spectres
grim
and
bloody
of
goblins
and
haunted
houses
from
whose
dim
desolation
strange
sounds
would
come
tales
long
since
heard
and
forgot
till
now
ghosts
why
the
road
was
full
of
them
they
crowded
upon
my
heels
they
peered
over
my
shoulders
i
felt
them
brush
my
elbows
and
heard
them
gibbering
at
me
from
the
shadows
and
the
sun
was
setting
already
ghosts
and
why
not
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
are
dreamed
of
in
your
philosophy
involuntarily
i
hastened
my
steps
but
the
sun
had
set
ere
i
reached
the
hollow
yes
the
sun
had
set
and
the
great
basin
below
me
was
already
brimful
of
shadows
which
as
i
watched
seemed
to
assume
shapes
vast
nebulous
and
constantly
changing
down
there
amid
the
purple
gloom
of
the
trees
indeed
it
looked
an
unholy
place
in
the
half
light
a
pit
framed
for
murders
and
the
safe
hiding
of
corpses
the
very
haunt
of
horrid
goblins
and
spectres
grim
and
ghastly
so
evilly
did
the
place
impress
me
that
it
needed
an
effort
of
will
ere
i
could
bring
myself
to
descend
the
precipitous
slope
bats
flitted
to
and
fro
across
my
path
now
and
then
emitting
their
sharp
needlelike
note
while
from
somewhere
in
the
dimness
beyond
an
owl
hooted
by
the
time
i
reached
the
cottage
it
had
fallen
quite
dark
here
in
the
hollow
though
the
light
still
lingered
in
the
world
above
so
i
took
out
my
and
one
of
the
candles
which
after
several
failures
i
succeeded
in
lighting
and
stepping
into
the
cottage
began
to
look
about
me
the
place
was
small
as
i
think
i
have
before
said
and
comprised
two
rooms
shut
off
from
each
other
by
a
strong
partition
with
a
door
midway
lifting
the
candle
i
glanced
at
the
staple
on
which
the
builder
of
the
cottage
had
choked
out
his
life
so
many
years
ago
and
calling
to
mind
the
ancient
fierce
desire
to
outlast
it
i
even
reached
up
my
hand
and
gave
it
a
shake
but
despite
the
rust
of
years
the
iron
felt
as
strong
and
rigid
as
ever
so
that
it
seemed
the
old
man
innocent
wish
must
go
unsatisfied
after
all
the
second
room
appeared
much
the
same
size
as
the
first
and
like
it
in
all
respects
till
looking
upwards
i
noticed
a
square
trap
door
in
a
corner
while
underneath
against
the
wall
hung
a
rough
ladder
this
i
proceeded
to
lift
down
and
mounting
cautiously
lifted
the
trap
holding
the
candle
above
my
head
to
survey
this
chamber
or
rather
garret
the
first
object
my
eye
encountered
was
a
small
tin
pannikin
and
beyond
that
a
stone
jar
or
demijohn
upon
closer
inspection
i
found
this
last
to
be
nearly
full
of
water
quite
sweet
and
fresh
to
the
taste
which
of
itself
was
sufficient
evidence
that
some
one
had
been
here
very
lately
i
now
observed
a
bundle
of
hay
in
one
corner
which
had
clearly
served
for
a
bed
beside
which
were
a
cracked
mug
a
tin
plate
a
pair
of
shoes
and
an
object
i
took
to
be
part
of
a
flute
or
wind
instrument
of
some
kind
but
what
particularly
excited
my
interest
were
the
shoes
which
had
evidently
seen
long
and
hard
service
for
they
were
much
worn
and
had
been
roughly
patched
here
and
there
very
big
they
were
and
somewhat
clumsy
and
square
of
toe
and
with
a
pair
of
enormous
silver
buckles
these
evidences
led
me
to
believe
that
whoever
had
been
here
before
was
likely
to
return
and
not
doubting
that
this
must
be
he
who
had
played
the
part
of
ghost
so
well
i
determined
to
be
ready
for
him
so
leaving
all
things
as
i
found
them
i
descended
and
having
closed
the
trap
hung
up
the
ladder
as
i
had
found
it
in
the
first
of
the
rooms
there
was
a
rough
fireplace
built
into
one
corner
and
as
the
air
struck
somewhat
damp
and
chill
i
went
out
and
gathered
a
quantity
of
twigs
and
dry
wood
and
had
soon
built
a
cheerful
crackling
fire
i
now
set
about
collecting
armfuls
of
dry
leaves
which
i
piled
against
the
wall
for
a
bed
by
the
time
this
was
completed
to
my
satisfaction
the
moon
was
peeping
above
the
treetops
filling
the
hollow
with
shadows
i
now
lay
down
upon
my
leafy
couch
and
fell
to
watching
the
fire
and
listening
to
the
small
soft
song
of
the
brook
outside
in
the
opposite
wall
was
a
window
the
glass
of
which
was
long
since
gone
through
which
i
could
see
a
square
of
sky
and
the
glittering
belt
of
orion
my
eyes
wandered
from
this
to
the
glow
of
the
fire
many
times
but
gradually
my
head
grew
heavier
and
heavier
until
at
length
the
stars
became
confused
with
the
winking
sparks
upon
the
hearth
and
the
last
that
i
remember
was
that
the
crackle
of
the
fire
sounded
strangely
like
the
voice
of
the
ancient
croaking
a
hijious
thing
peter
a
hijious
thing
i
must
have
slept
for
an
hour
or
nearer
two
for
the
room
was
dark
save
for
a
few
glowing
embers
on
the
hearth
and
the
faint
light
of
the
stars
at
the
window
when
i
suddenly
sat
bolt
upright
with
every
tingling
nerve
straining
as
if
to
catch
something
which
had
but
that
very
moment
eluded
me
i
was
yet
wondering
what
this
could
be
when
from
somewhere
close
outside
the
cottage
there
rose
a
sudden
cry
hideous
and
appalling
a
bubbling
scream
no
other
words
can
describe
it
that
died
slowly
down
to
a
wail
only
to
rise
again
higher
and
higher
till
it
seemed
to
pierce
my
very
brain
then
all
at
once
it
was
gone
and
silence
rushed
in
upon
me
a
silence
fraught
with
fear
and
horror
unimaginable
i
lay
rigid
the
blood
in
my
veins
jumping
with
every
throb
of
my
heart
till
it
seemed
to
shake
me
from
head
to
foot
and
then
the
cry
began
again
deep
and
hoarse
at
first
but
rising
rising
until
the
air
thrilled
with
a
scream
such
as
no
earthly
lips
could
utter
now
the
light
at
the
window
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
all
at
once
a
feeble
shaft
of
moonlight
crept
across
the
floor
i
was
watching
this
most
welcome
beam
when
it
was
again
obscured
by
a
something
indefinable
at
first
but
which
i
gradually
made
out
to
be
very
like
a
human
head
peering
in
at
me
but
if
this
was
so
it
seemed
a
head
hideously
misshapen
and
there
sure
enough
rising
from
the
brow
was
a
long
pointed
horn
as
i
lay
motionless
staring
at
this
thing
my
hand
by
some
most
fortunate
chance
encountered
the
pistol
in
my
pocket
and
from
the
very
depths
of
my
soul
i
poured
benedictions
upon
the
honest
head
of
simon
the
innkeeper
for
its
very
contact
seemed
to
restore
my
benumbed
faculties
with
a
single
bound
i
was
upon
my
feet
and
had
the
weapon
levelled
at
the
window
speak
said
i
speak
or
i
shoot
there
was
a
moment
of
tingling
suspense
and
then
oh
man
dinna
do
that
said
a
voice
then
come
in
and
show
yourself
herewith
the
head
incontinently
disappeared
there
was
the
sound
of
a
heavy
step
and
a
tall
figure
loomed
in
the
doorway
wait
said
i
as
fumbling
about
i
presently
found
and
candle
having
lighted
which
i
turned
and
beheld
a
man
an
exceedingly
tall
man
clad
in
the
full
habit
of
a
scottish
highlander
by
his
side
hung
a
long
straight
sword
beneath
one
arm
he
carried
a
bagpipe
while
upon
his
head
was
not
a
horn
but
a
scot
bonnet
with
a
long
eagle
feather
oh
man
said
he
eyeing
me
with
a
somewhat
wry
smile
i
juist
thinkin

indeed
they
told
me
it
was
haunted
but
i
determined
to
see
for
myself
weel
well
i
am
glad
to
find
it
haunted
by
nothing
worse
than
a
wandering
scots
piper
the
highlander
smiled
his
wry
smile
and
taking
out
a
inhaled
a
pinch
regarding
me
the
while
ye
the
first
as
ever
stayed
after
they
heard
the
first
bit
squeakie
tae
find
out
if
were
a
real
bogle
or
no
but
how
in
the
world
did
you
make
such
awful
sounds
i
thinkin
it
the
bit
squeakie
ye
be
meanin
he
inquired
yes
how
did
you
do
it
oh
it
juist
the
pipes
he
answered
patting
them
affectionately
will
i
show
ye
the
noo
pray
do
said
hereupon
he
set
the
mouthpiece
to
his
lips
inflated
the
bag
stopped
the
vents
with
his
fingers
and
immediately
the
air
vibrated
with
the
bubbling
scream
i
have
already
attempted
to
describe
oh
man
he
exclaimed
laying
the
still
groaning
instrument
gently
aside
oh
man
is
it
no
juist
but
what
has
been
your
object
in
terrifying
people
out
of
their
wits
in
this
manner
sir
it
a
on
account
o
the
snuff
snuff
i
repeated
juist
that
he
nodded
snuff
said
i
again
what
do
you
mean
the
piper
smiled
again
a
slow
smile
that
seemingly
dawned
only
to
vanish
again
it
was
indeed
if
i
may
so
express
it
a
grave
and
solemn
smile
and
his
nearest
approach
to
mirth
for
not
once
in
the
days
which
followed
did
i
ever
see
him
give
vent
to
a
laugh
i
here
also
take
the
opportunity
to
say
that
i
have
greatly
modified
his
speech
in
the
writing
for
it
was
so
broad
that
i
had
much
ado
to
grasp
his
meaning
at
times
the
piper
smiled
then
and
unwinding
the
plaid
from
his
shoulder
spread
it
upon
the
floor
and
sat
down
ye
maun
ken
he
began
that
i
hae
muckle
love
for
the
snuff

but
what

an
pay
for

saxpence
or

that
apartin
wi
for
a
bed
little
better
than
mine
so
wishfu
tae
keep
this
bit
hoosie
tae
mysel
seein
was
haunted
as
they
ca
it
i
juist
kep
up
the
illusion
on
account
o
trampers
wanderin
gypsies
an
dirty
tykes
eh
but
was
fair
graund
tae
see
rinnin
awa
as
if
the
were
after
them
spierin
back
their
shoulders
an
a
by
reason
of
a
bit
squeakie
o
the
pipes
here
so
sir
ye
hae
it
i
now
proceeded
to
build
and
relight
the
fire
during
which
the
scot
drew
a
packet
of
bread
and
cheese
from
his
sporran
together
with
a
flask
which
having
uncorked
he
held
out
to
me
with
the
one
word
whuskey
thank
you
donald
but
i
rarely
drink
anything
stronger
than
ale
said
i
aweel
said
he
if
ye
winna
ye
winna
an
there
but
a
wee
drappie
left
tae
be
sure
whereupon
after
two
or
three
generous
gulps
he
addressed
himself
to
his
bread
and
cheese
and
i
following
his
example
took
out
the
edibles
simon
had
provided
an
ye
minded
tae
bide
here
ye
tell
me
he
inquired
after
a
while
yes
i
nodded
but
that
need
not
interfere
with
you
two
can
live
here
as
easily
as
one
and
now
that
i
have
had
a
good
look
at
you
i
think
we
might
get
along
very
well
together
sir
said
he
solemnly
my
race
is
royal
i
am
a
stuart
here
a
stuart
hand
and
he
reached
out
his
hand
to
me
across
the
hearth
with
a
gesture
that
was
full
of
a
reposeful
dignity
indeed
i
never
remember
to
have
seen
donald
anything
but
dignified
how
do
you
find
life
in
these
parts
i
inquired
indeefferent
sir
vera
indeefferent
tae
be
sure
at
fairs
i
often
had
as
much
as
ten
shillin
in
bonnet
at
a
time
but
it
juist
the
kilties
that
draw
em
they
hae
no
real
love
for
the
pipes
whateffer
a
rantin
reel
pleases
well
eneugh
but
eh
they
hae
no
hankerin
for
the
gude
music
that
is
a
question
open
to
argument
donald
said
i
can
any
one
play
real
music
on
a
bagpipe
think
you
sir
returned
the
scot
setting
down
the
empty
flask
and
frowning
darkly
at
the
fire
the
pipes
is
the
king
of
a
instruments
is
the
sweetest
the
truest
the
oldest
whateffer
true
it
is
very
old
said
i
thoughtfully
it
was
known
i
believe
to
the
greeks
and
we
find
mention
of
it
in
the
latin
as
utricularia
suetonius
tells
us
that
nero
promised
to
appear
publicly
as
a
bagpiper
then
too
chaucer
miller
played
a
bagpipe
and
shakespeare
frequently
mentions
the
of
a
lincolnshire
bagpipe
yes
it
is
certainly
a
very
old
and
i
think
a
very
barbarous
instrument
hoot
toot
the
man
talks
like
a
muckle
fule
said
donald
nodding
to
the
fire
for
instance
i
continued
there
can
be
no
comparison
between
a
bagpipe
and
a
fiddle
say
a
fiddle
exclaimed
donald
in
accents
of
withering
scorn
and
still
addressing
the
fire
ye
can
juist
tell
him
tae
gang
tae
the
his
fiddle
music
is
i
take
it
the
expression
of
one
mood
or
thought
a
dream
translated
into
sound
said
i
thoughtfully
therefore
hae
ye
ever
heard
the
pipes
why
yes
but
long
ago
then
said
donald
ye
shall
juist
hear
again
so
saying
he
wiped
his
mouth
took
up
his
instrument
and
began
slowly
inflating
it
then
all
at
once
from
drones
and
chanter
there
rushed
forth
such
a
flood
of
melody
as
seemed
to
sweep
me
away
upon
its
tide
first
i
seemed
to
hear
a
roar
of
wind
through
desolate
glens
a
moan
of
trees
and
a
rush
of
sounding
waters
yet
softly
softly
there
rises
above
the
flood
of
sound
a
little
rippling
melody
which
comes
and
goes
and
comes
again
growing
ever
sweeter
with
repetition
and
now
the
roar
of
wind
is
changed
to
the
swing
of
marching
feet
the
tread
of
a
mighty
host
whose
step
is
strong
and
free
and
lo
they
are
singing
as
they
march
and
the
song
is
bold
and
wild
wild
wild
again
and
again
beneath
the
song
beneath
the
rhythm
of
marching
feet
the
melody
rises
very
sweet
but
infinitely
sad
like
a
silver
pipe
or
an
angel
voice
tremulous
with
tears
once
again
the
theme
changes
and
it
is
battle
and
death
sudden
and
sharp
there
is
the
rush
and
shock
of
charging
ranks
and
the
surge
and
tumult
of
conflict
above
whose
thunder
loud
and
clear
and
shrill
like
some
the
melody
swells
one
moment
triumphant
and
the
next
lost
again
but
the
thunder
rolls
away
distant
and
more
distant
the
day
is
lost
and
won
but
sudden
and
clear
the
melody
rings
out
once
more
fuller
now
richer
and
complete
the
silver
pipe
has
become
a
golden
trumpet
and
yet
what
sorrow
what
anguish
unspeakable
rings
through
it
the
weeping
and
wailing
of
a
nation
so
the
melody
sinks
slowly
to
die
away
in
one
minor
note
and
donald
is
looking
across
at
me
with
his
grave
smile
and
i
will
admit
both
his
face
and
figure
are
sadly
blurred
donald
said
i
after
a
little
donald
i
will
never
speak
against
the
pipes
again
they
are
indeed
the
king
of
all
instruments
played
as
you
play
them
ou
ay
i
a
bonnie
piper
i
no
deny
it
he
answered
i
glad
ye
like
it
for
sassenach
though
ye
be
it
proves
ye
hae
the
music
is
a
bit
pibroch

him

so
tae

southeron
saying

he
rose
saluted
me
stiffly
and
stalked
majestically
to
bed
chapter
xxix
how
black
george
and
i
shook
hands
the
world
was
full
of
sunshine
the
blithe
song
of
birds
and
the
sweet
pure
breath
of
waking
flowers
as
i
rose
next
morning
and
coming
to
the
stream
threw
myself
down
beside
it
and
plunged
my
hands
and
arms
and
head
into
the
limpid
water
whose
contact
seemed
to
fill
me
with
a
wondrous
gladness
in
keeping
with
the
world
about
me
in
a
little
while
i
rose
with
the
water
dripping
from
me
and
having
made
shift
to
dry
myself
upon
my
neckcloth
nothing
else
being
available
returned
to
the
cottage
above
my
head
i
could
hear
a
gentle
sound
rising
and
falling
with
a
rhythmic
measure
that
told
me
donald
still
slept
so
clapping
on
my
hat
and
coat
i
started
out
to
my
first
day
work
at
the
forge
breakfastless
for
the
good
and
sufficient
reason
that
there
was
none
to
be
had
but
full
of
the
glad
pure
beauty
of
the
morning
and
i
bethought
me
of
the
old
psalmist
deathless
words
though
sorrow
endure
for
a
night
yet
joy
cometh
in
the
morning
brave
true
words
which
shall
go
ringing
down
the
ages
to
bear
hope
and
consolation
to
many
a
wearied
troubled
soul
for
now
as
i
climbed
the
steep
path
where
bats
had
hovered
last
night
and
turned
to
look
back
at
the
pit
which
had
seemed
a
place
of
horror
behold
it
was
become
a
very
paradise
of
quivering
green
spangled
with
myriad
jewels
where
the
dew
yet
clung
indeed
if
any
man
would
experience
the
full
ecstasy
of
being
alive
the
joi
de
vivre
as
the
french
have
it
let
him
go
out
into
the
early
morning
when
the
sun
is
young
and
look
about
him
with
a
seeing
eye
so
in
a
little
while
with
the
golden
song
of
a
blackbird
in
my
ears
i
turned
very
hungry
yet
nevertheless
content
long
before
i
reached
the
smithy
i
could
hear
the
ring
of
black
george
hammer
though
the
village
was
not
yet
astir
and
it
was
with
some
trepidation
as
to
my
reception
that
i
approached
the
open
doorway
there
he
stood
busy
at
his
anvil
goodly
to
look
upon
in
his
might
and
with
the
sun
shining
in
his
yellow
hair
a
veritable
son
of
anak
he
might
have
been
some
hero
or
demigod
come
back
from
that
dim
age
when
angels
wooed
the
daughters
of
men
rather
than
a
village
blacksmith
and
a
very
sulky
one
at
that
for
though
he
must
have
been
aware
of
my
presence
he
never
glanced
up
or
gave
the
slightest
sign
of
welcome
or
the
reverse
now
as
i
watched
i
noticed
a
certain
slowness
a
heaviness
in
all
his
movements
together
with
a
listless
slipshod
air
which
i
judged
was
very
foreign
to
him
moreover
as
he
worked
i
thought
he
hung
his
head
lower
than
was
quite
necessary
george
george
went
on
hammering
george
said
i
again
he
raised
the
hammer
for
another
stroke
hesitated
then
lifted
his
head
with
a
jerk
and
immediately
i
knew
why
he
had
avoided
my
eye
what
do
want
wi
me
i
have
come
for
two
reasons
said
i
one
is
to
begin
work
then
ye
best
go
away
again
he
broke
in
ye
get
no
work
here
and
the
second
i
went
on
is
to
offer
you
my
hand
will
you
take
it
george
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
no
he
burst
out
vehemently
no
i
tell
ye
think
to
come
an
crow
me
because
ye
beat
me
by
a
trick
and
because
ye
heerd
her
his
voice
broke
and
dropping
his
hammer
he
turned
his
back
upon
me
called
me
she
did
he
went
on
after
a
little
while
you
heerd
her
they
all
heerd
her
i
been
a
danged
fule
he
said
more
as
if
speaking
his
thoughts
aloud
than
addressing
me
but
a
man
ca
help
lovin
a
lass
like
prue
and
when
loves
ca
hopin
i
hoped
these
three
years
an
more
and
last
night
she
called
me
coward
something
bright
and
glistening
splashed
down
upon
the
anvil
and
there
ensued
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
piping
of
the
birds
and
the
stirring
of
the
leaves
outside
a
fule
i
be
said
black
george
at
last
shaking
his
head
no
kind
man
for
the
likes
o
her
too
big
i
be
and
rough
and
yet
if
only
given
me
the
chance
again
there
fell
a
silence
wherein
mingled
with
the
came
the
tap
tapping
of
a
stick
upon
the
hard
road
and
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
whereupon
george
seized
the
handle
of
the
bellows
and
fell
to
blowing
the
fire
vigorously
yet
once
i
saw
him
draw
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
with
a
quick
furtive
gesture
a
moment
after
the
ancient
appeared
a
quaint
befrocked
figure
framed
in
the
yawning
doorway
and
backed
by
the
glory
of
the
morning
he
stood
awhile
to
lean
upon
his
stick
and
peer
about
his
old
eyes
still
dazzled
by
the
sunlight
he
had
just
left
owing
to
which
he
failed
to
see
me
where
i
sat
in
the
shadow
of
the
forge
marnin
jarge
said
he
with
his
quick
bright
nod
the
scowl
was
blacker
and
his
deep
voice
gruffer
than
usual
as
he
returned
the
greeting
but
the
old
man
seemed
to
heed
it
not
at
all
but
taking
his
from
the
lining
of
his
tall
hat
its
usual
abiding
place
he
opened
it
with
his
most
important
air
jarge
said
he
i
thinkin
ye
better
tak
job
back
to
strike
for
ye
again
if
you
goin
to
mend
t
owd
screen
what
d
mean
growled
black
george
because
continued
the
old
man
gathering
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
great
deliberation
because
jarge
the
young
feller
as
beat
ye
at
the
throwin
as
was
to
worked
for
ye
at
own
price

what
cried
black
george
starting
dead
nodded
the
old
man
a
corp
be
eh
such
a
fine
young
chap
an
now
a
corp
here
the
ancient
nodded
solemnly
again
three
times
and
inhaled
his
pinch
of
snuff
with
great
apparent
zest
and
enjoyment
why
began
the
amazed
george
what
and
broke
off
to
stare
last
night
as
ever
was
continued
the
old
man
went
down
to
cottage
were
no
manner
o
use
tryin
to
turn

i
follered
un
an
seen
for
myself
so
now
down
to
find
corp
he
had
reached
thus
far
when
his
eye
accustomed
to
the
shadows
chancing
to
meet
mine
he
uttered
a
gasp
and
stood
staring
at
me
with
dropped
jaw
peter
he
stammered
at
last
peter
be
that
you
peter
to
be
sure
it
is
said
i
bea
ye
dead
then
i
never
felt
more
full
of
life
but
ye
slep
in
th
cottage
last
night
yes
but
but
the
ghost
peter
is
a
wandering
scotsman
why
then
i
ca
go
down
and
find
ye
corp
arter
all
i
fear

ancient
the
old
man
slowly
closed
his
shaking
his
head
as
he
did
so
ah
well
i
wo
blame
ye
peter
said
he
magnanunously
it
your
fault
lad
no
but
what
come
to
the
ghost
the
ghost
i
answered
is
nothing
more
dreadful
than
a
wandering
scotsman
scotsman
exclaimed
the
ancient
sharply
scotsman
yes
ancient
you
mazed
peter
ah
mazed
ye
be
what
are
i
heerd
un
an
groanin
to
ah
an
twitterin
to
as
to
that
said
i
those
shrieks
and
howls
he
made
with
his
bagpipe
very
easy
for
a
skilled
player
such
as
he
some
one
was
drawing
water
from
a
well
across
the
road
for
i
heard
the
rattle
of
the
bucket
and
the
creak
of
the
winch
in
the
pause
which
now
ensued
during
which
the
ancient
propped
upon
his
stick
surveyed
me
with
an
expression
that
was
not
exactly
anger
nor
contempt
nor
sorrow
and
yet
something
of
all
three
at
length
he
sighed
and
shook
his
head
at
me
mournfully
peter
said
he
peter
i
did
think
as
you
try
to
tak
of
a
old
man
wi
a
tale
the
like
o
that
such
a
very
very
old
man
peter
such
a
old
old
man
but
i
assure
you
it
the
truth
said
i
earnestly
peter
i
seen
scotchmen
afore
now
said
he
with
a
reproachful
look
ah
that
i
many
the
time
an
scotchmen
do
go
about
tails
nor
yet
wi
on
their
leastways
i
never
seen
one
as
did
an
peter
i
know
what
a
bagpipe
is
i
heerd
often
often
squeak
they
do
yes
but
a
squeak
bea
a
scream
peter
nor
yet
a
groan
no
having
delivered
himself
of
which
the
ancient
shook
his
head
at
me
again
and
turning
his
back
hobbled
away
when
i
turned
to
look
at
george
it
was
to
find
him
regarding
me
with
a
very
strange
expression
sir
said
he
ponderously
did
you
sleep
in
th
cottage
last
night
yes
though
as
i
have
tried
to
explain
and
unsuccessfully
it
seems
it
is
haunted
by
nothing
more
alarming
than
a
scots
piper
sir
said
george
in
the
same
slow
heavy
way
i
could
go
the
place
myself
arter
dark
i
be
ah
i
be
afeard
to
i
did
go
once
and
then
not
alone
and
i
ran
away
sir
you
a
better
man
nor
me
you
done
what
i
durst
do
sir
if
so
be
as
you
in
the
same
mind
about
it
i
should
like
to
to
shake
your
hand
so
there
across
the
anvil
which
was
to
link
our
lives
together
thenceforth
black
george
and
i
clasped
hands
looking
into
each
other
eyes
george
said
i
at
last
i
had
no
breakfast
nor
i
said
george
and
i
mightily
hungry
so
am
i
said
george
then
come
and
let
us
eat
and
i
turned
to
the
door
why
so
we
will
but
not
at
bull
she
be
theer
come
to
my
cottage
it
be
close
by
that
is
if
you
care
to
sir
with
all
my
heart
said
i
and
my
name
is
peter
what
do
you
say
to
and
eggs
peter
ham
and
eggs
will
be
most
excellent
said
i
chapter
xxx
in
which
i
forswear
myself
and
am
accused
of
possessing
the
evil
eye
smithing
is
a
sturdy
albeit
a
very
black
art
yet
its
black
is
a
good
honest
black
very
easily
washed
off
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
many
other
trades
arts
and
professions
yes
a
fine
free
manly
art
is
smithing
and
those
who
labor
at
the
forge
would
seem
necessarily
to
reflect
these
virtues
since
old
tubal
cain
first
taught
man
how
to
work
in
brass
and
iron
who
ever
heard
of
a
sneaking
cowardly
blacksmith
to
find
such
an
one
were
as
hard
a
matter
as
to
discover
the
fourth
dimension
methinks
or
the
carcass
of
a
dead
donkey
your
true
blacksmith
is
usually
a
strong
man
something
bowed
of
shoulder
perhaps
a
man
slow
of
speech
bold
of
eye
kindly
of
thought
and
lastly
riches
genius
power
all
are
fair
things
yet
riches
is
never
satisfied
power
is
ever
upon
the
wing
and
when
was
genius
ever
happy
but
as
for
this
divine
gift
of
simpleness
of
heart
who
shall
say
it
is
not
the
best
of
all
black
george
himself
was
no
exception
to
his
kind
what
wonder
was
it
then
that
as
the
days
lengthened
into
weeks
my
liking
for
him
ripened
into
friendship
to
us
sometimes
lonely
voyagers
upon
this
broad
highway
of
life
journeying
on
perchance
through
desolate
places
yet
hoping
and
dreaming
ever
of
a
glorious
beyond
how
sweet
and
how
blessed
a
thing
it
is
to
meet
some
fellow
wayfarer
and
find
in
him
a
friend
honest
and
loyal
and
brave
to
walk
with
us
in
the
sun
whose
voice
may
comfort
us
in
the
shadow
whose
hand
is
stretched
out
to
us
in
the
difficult
places
to
aid
us
or
be
aided
indeed
i
say
again
it
is
a
blessed
thing
for
though
the
way
is
sometimes
very
long
such
meetings
and
friendships
be
very
few
and
far
between
so
as
i
say
there
came
such
friendship
between
black
george
and
myself
and
i
found
him
a
man
strong
simple
and
lovable
and
as
such
i
honor
him
to
this
day
the
ancient
on
the
contrary
seemed
to
have
set
me
in
his
black
books
he
would
no
longer
sit
with
me
over
a
tankard
outside
the
bull
of
an
evening
nor
look
in
at
the
forge
with
a
cheery
nod
and
word
as
had
been
his
wont
he
seemed
rather
to
shun
my
society
and
if
i
did
meet
him
by
chance
would
treat
me
with
the
frigid
dignity
of
a
grand
seigneur
indeed
the
haughtiest
duke
that
ever
rolled
in
his
chariot
is
far
less
proud
than
your
plain
english
rustic
and
far
less
difficult
to
propitiate
thus
though
i
had
once
had
the
temerity
to
question
him
as
to
his
altered
treatment
of
me
the
once
had
sufficed
he
was
sitting
i
remember
on
the
bench
before
the
bull
his
hands
crossed
upon
his
stick
and
his
chin
resting
upon
his
hands
peter
he
had
answered
regarding
me
with
a
terrible
eye
peter
i
be
in
ye
hereupon
rising
he
had
rapped
loudly
upon
his
and
hobbled
stiffly
away
and
that
ended
the
matter
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
though
to
be
sure
simon
had
interceded
in
my
behalf
with
no
better
success
and
thus
i
was
still
left
wondering
one
day
however
as
george
and
i
were
hard
at
work
i
became
aware
of
some
one
standing
in
the
doorway
behind
me
but
at
first
paid
no
heed
for
it
was
become
the
custom
for
folk
to
come
to
look
at
the
man
who
lived
all
alone
in
the
haunted
cottage
so
as
i
say
i
worked
on
heedlessly
peter
said
a
voice
at
last
and
turning
i
beheld
the
old
man
leaning
upon
his
stick
and
regarding
me
beneath
his
lowered
brows
why
ancient
i
exclaimed
and
held
out
my
hand
but
he
checked
me
with
a
gesture
and
fumblingly
took
out
his
peter
said
he
fixing
me
with
his
eye
were
it
a
scotchman
or
were
it
not
why
to
be
sure
it
was
i
answered
a
scotch
piper
as
i
told
you
and
peter
said
the
ancient
tapping
his
it
were
no
ghost
then
ay
or
no
no
said
i
nothing
but
a
peter
said
the
ancient
nodding
solemnly
peter
i
ye
and
turning
sharp
about
he
tottered
away
upon
his
stick
so
that
it
said
i
staring
after
the
old
man
retreating
figure
why
ye
see
said
george
somewhat
diffidently
ye
see
peter
gaffer
be
so
old
and
all
friends
be
dead
and
he
come
to
look
on
this
ghost
as
belongin
to
loves
to
sit
an
tell
about
it
do
it
be
all
got
left
to
live
for
as
ye
might
say
and
now
you
been
and
gone
and
said
as
theer
bea
no
ghost
arter
all
d
see
ah
yes
i
see
i
nodded
i
see
but
you
do
still
believe
in
this
ghost
do
you
george
not
answered
george
hesitating
upon
the
word
ca
say
as
i
believe
and
yet
lord
should
i
know
then
you
do
still
believe
in
the
ghost
why
y
see
peter
we
do
know
as
a
man
theer
gaffer
found
un
likewise
i
heerd
it
scream
but
as
for
believin
in
it
since
you
say
contrarywise
why
should
i
know
but
why
should
i
deny
it
george
why
should
i
tell
you
all
of
a
scotsman
why
y
see
peter
said
george
in
his
heavy
way
you
be
such
a
strange
sort
o
chap
george
said
i
let
us
get
back
to
work
yet
in
a
little
while
i
set
aside
the
hammer
and
turned
to
the
door
peter
wheer
be
goin
to
try
and
make
my
peace
with
the
ancient
i
answered
and
forthwith
crossed
the
road
to
the
bull
but
with
my
foot
on
the
step
i
paused
arrested
by
the
sound
of
voices
and
laughter
within
the
tap
and
loudest
of
all
was
the
voice
of
the
pseudo
blacksmith
job
if
i
were
only
a
bit
younger
the
ancient
was
saying
now
peeping
in
through
the
casement
a
glance
at
his
dejected
attitude
and
the
blatant
bearing
of
the
others
explained
to
me
the
situation
then
and
there
ah
but
you
ai
retorted
old
amos
you
a
old
old
man
gettin
older
wi
every
tick
o
the
clock

the
five
or
six
others

simon

into
the
road
so

ancient
gaffer

but

i

un
the
cracked
old
voice
sounded
more
broken
than
usual
and
i
saw
a
tear
crawling
slowly
down
the
ancient
furrowed
cheek
nobody
answered
and
there
fell
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
shuffle
and
scrape
of
heavy
boots
and
the
setting
down
of
tankards
why
ye
see
gaffer
said
job
at
last

a
lot
o

i
stepping
into
the
room

exclaimed
job
while
pairs
of
eyes
stared
at

in
slow
wonderment

i
have
but
you
said
as

were
a
scotchman
wi
a
bagpipe
i
heerd
ye
we
all

and

like

peter
cried
the
ancient
rising
up
out
of
his
chair
peter
do
mean
it
to
be
sure
i
do
do
mean
it
were
a
ghost
peter

why
of
course

i
nodded
a
ghost
or
the
devil
himself
hoof
horns
tail
and
all
to
say
nothing
of
the
fire
and
brimstone
peter
said
the
ancient
straightening
his
bent
old
back
proudly
oh
peter
tell
i
a
man
o
truth
an
no
liar
tell
peter
they
know
that
said
i
they
know
it
without
my
telling
them
ancient
but
said
job
staring
at
me
aghast
do
mean
to
say
as
you
live
in
a
place
as
is
by
the
devil
oh
lord
bless
cried
the
old
man
laying
his
hand
upon
my
arm
peter
do
mind
old
nick
no
more
i
do
peter
are
afeard
of
why
a
clean
peter
you
do
mind
old
nick
do
lad
not
in
the
least
said
i
whereupon
those
nearest
instinctively
shrank
farther
from
me
while
old
amos
rose
and
shuffled
towards
the
door
i
heerd
o
folk
sellin
theirselves
to
the
devil
afore
now
said
he
you
be
a
danged
fule
joel
amos
exclaimed
the
ancient
angrily
fule
or
no
i
never
see
a
chap
wi
such
a
face
afore
an
wi
such
eyes
so
black
an
sharp
an
piercin
as
needles
they
be
ah
goes
through
a
man
like
two
gimblets
they
do
now
as
he
spoke
old
amos
stretched
out
one
arm
towards
me
with
his
first
and
second
fingers
crossed
which
fingers
he
now
opened
wide
apart
making
what
i
believe
is
called
the
horns
and
an
infallible
safeguard
against
this
particular
form
of
evil
it
the
eye
said
he
in
a
half
whisper
the
eye
and
turning
about
betook
himself
away
one
by
one
the
others
followed
and
as
they
passed
me
each
man
averted
his
eyes
and
i
saw
that
each
had
his
fingers
crossed
so
it
came
to
pass
that
i
was
thenceforward
regarded
askance
if
not
openly
avoided
by
the
whole
village
with
the
exception
of
simon
and
the
ancient
as
one
in
league
with
the
devil
and
possessed
of
the
evil
eye
chapter
xxxi
in
which
donald
bids
me
farewell
halcyon
days
my
masters
happy
halcyon
days
to
waken
to
the
glory
of
a
summer
morning
and
shaking
off
dull
sleep
like
a
mantle
to
stride
out
into
a
world
all
green
and
gold
breathing
a
fragrant
air
laden
with
sweet
earthy
smells
to
plunge
within
the
clear
cool
waters
of
the
brook
whose
magic
seemed
to
fill
one
blood
with
added
life
and
lust
of
living
anon
with
gargantuan
appetite
to
sit
and
eat
until
even
donald
would
fall
and
so
through
shady
coppice
and
sunny
meadow
betimes
to
work
halcyon
days
my
masters
happy
halcyon
days
with
the
ringing
hammers
the
dancing
sparks
mounting
upon
the
smoke
the
sweat
the
toil
yet
all
lightened
with
laugh
and
song
and
and
then
the
labor
done
the
fire
dead
black
george
to
his
lonely
cottage
and
i
to
the
bull
there
to
sit
between
simon
and
the
ancient
waited
upon
by
the
dexterous
hands
of
prudence
what
mighty
rounds
of
juicy
beef
washed
down
by
draughts
of
good
brown
ale
what
pies
and
puddings
prepared
by
those
same
slender
dexterous
hands
and
later
pipe
in
mouth
what
grave
discussions
upon
men
and
things
peace
and
war
the
dead
and
the
living
the
rise
and
fall
of
nations
and
simon
new
litter
of
pigs
at
last
the
good
nights
being
said
homeward
through
the
twilit
lanes
often
pausing
to
look
upon
the
shadowy
woods
to
watch
some
star
or
hearken
to
the
mournful
note
of
a
night
jar
soft
with
distance
what
wonder
if
at
this
time
my
earlier
dreams
and
ambitions
faded
from
my
ken
what
wonder
that
petronius
arbiter
and
the
jolly
sieur
de
brantome
lay
neglected
in
my
dusty
knapsack
go
to
petronius
go
to
how
stale
flat
and
unprofitable
were
all
thy
vaunted
pleasures
compared
with
mine
alas
for
thy
noble
intellect
draggled
in
the
mire
to
pander
to
an
imperial
swine
and
for
all
thy
power
and
wise
statecraft
which
yet
could
not
save
thee
from
untimely
death
and
thou
brantome
old
gossip
with
all
thy
scandalous
stories
of
ladies
always
and
ever
tres
belle
et
fort
honnete
couldst
not
find
time
among
them
all
to
note
the
glories
of
the
world
wherein
they
lived
and
moved
and
had
their
fort
honnete
being
but
let
it
not
be
thought
my
leisure
hours
were
passed
in
idle
dreaming
and
luxurious
ease
on
the
contrary
i
had
with
much
ado
rethatched
the
broken
roof
of
my
cottage
as
well
as
i
might
mended
the
chimney
fitted
glass
to
the
casements
and
a
new
door
upon
its
hinges
this
last
was
somewhat
clumsily
contrived
i
grant
you
and
of
a
vasty
strength
quite
unnecessary
yet
a
very
excellent
door
i
considered
it
nevertheless
having
thus
rendered
my
cottage
i
next
turned
my
attention
to
furnishing
it
to
which
end
i
in
turn
and
with
infinite
labor
constructed
a
bedstead
two
and
a
table
all
to
the
profound
disgust
of
donald
who
could
by
no
means
abide
the
rasp
of
my
saw
so
that
reaching
for
his
pipes
he
would
fill
the
air
with
eldrich
shrieks
and
groans
or
drown
me
in
a
torrent
of
martial
melody
it
was
about
this
time
that
is
to
say
my
second
bedstead
was
nearing
completion
and
i
was
seriously
considering
the
building
of
a
press
with
cupboards
to
hold
my
crockery
also
a
shelf
for
my
books
when
chancing
to
return
home
somewhat
earlier
than
usual
i
was
surprised
to
see
donald
sitting
upon
the
bench
i
had
set
up
beside
the
door
polishing
the
buckles
of
that
identical
pair
of
shoes
that
had
once
so
piqued
my
curiosity
as
i
approached
he
rose
and
came
to
meet
me
with
the
brogues
in
his
hand
man
peter
said
he
i
maun
juist
be
gangin
going
i
repeated
going
where
back

and
yet
heaven

be
sorry
to

an

for
the
lassie
i
no
hae
the
heart
tae
leave
ye
ye
no
be
forgettin
the
wallace
lament
never

i
oh

in
my
mind

pipin

forbye
there
nae
man
hielander
nor
lowlander
has
juist
the
trick
o
the
like
me
an
it
no
vera
like
we
shall
meet
again
this
warld
man
peter
but
i
aye
think
o
ye
away
there
in
glenure
when
i
play
the
wallace
bit
tune
i
aye
think
ye
peter
man
after
this
we
stood
awhile
staring
past
each
other
into
the
deepening
shadows
peter
said
he
at
last
it
no
a
vera
genteel
present
tae
be
ye
i
doot
and
he
held
up
the
battered
shoes
they
unco
worn
an
wi
a
clout
here
an
there
ye
notice
but
the
buckles
are
guid
siller
an
i
hae
naething
else
to
ye
ay
man
but
it
many
a
weary
mile
i
marched
in
these
at
the
head
o
the
it
mony
a
stark
fecht
they
been
through
vittoria
salamanca
talavera
tae
quatre
bras
an
waterloo
tak
peter

tae
mind
ye
sometimes
o
donal
stuart
an
now
us
a
grup
o
ye
hand
gude
keep
ye
peter
man
so
saying
he
thrust
the
brogues
upon
me
caught
and
squeezed
my
hand
and
turning
sharp
about
strode
away
through
the
shadows
his
kilt
swaying
and
tartans
streaming
gallantly
and
presently
i
went
and
sat
me
down
upon
the
bench
beside
the
door
with
the
shoes
upon
my
knee
suddenly
as
i
sat
there
faint
and
fainter
with
distance
and
unutterably
sad
came
the
slow
sweet
music
of
donald
pipes
playing
the
wallace
lament
softly
the
melody
rose
and
fell
until
it
died
away
in
one
wailing
note
now
as
it
ended
i
rose
and
uncovered
my
head
for
i
knew
this
was
donald
last
farewell
much
more
i
might
have
told
of
this
strange
yet
lovable
man
who
was
by
turns
the
scarred
soldier
full
of
stirring
tales
of
camp
and
battlefield
the
mischievous
child
delighting
in
tricks
and
rogueries
of
all
sorts
and
the
stately
hieland
gentleman
many
wild
legends
he
told
me
of
his
native
glens
with
strange
tales
of
the
second
sight
but
here
perforce
must
be
no
place
for
such
so
here
then
i
leave
donald
and
hurry
on
with
my
narrative
chapter
xxxii
in
which
this
first
book
begins
to
draw
to
a
close
strike
ding
ding
strike
ding
ding
the
iron
glows
and
loveth
good
blows
as
fire
doth
bellows
strike
ding
ding
out
beyond
the
smithy
door
a
solitary
star
twinkles
low
down
in
the
night
sky
like
some
great
jewel
but
we
have
no
time
for
black
george
and
i
for
we
are
at
work
on
the
old
church
screen
which
must
be
finished
and
so
the
bellows
roar
hoarsely
the
hammers
clang
and
the
sparks
fly
while
the
sooty
face
of
black
george
now
in
shadow
now
illumed
by
the
fire
seems
like
the
face
of
some
or
salamander
in
the
corner
perched
securely
out
of
reach
of
stray
sparks
sits
the
ancient
in
hand
as
usual
to
my
mind
a
forge
is
at
its
best
by
night
for
in
the
red
fiery
glow
the
blackened
walls
the
shining
anvil
and
the
smith
himself
and
bare
of
chest
are
all
magically
transfigured
while
in
the
hush
of
night
the
drone
of
the
bellows
sounds
more
impressive
the
stroke
of
the
hammers
more
sonorous
and
musical
and
the
flying
sparks
mark
plainly
their
individual
courses
ere
they
vanish
i
stand
feet
well
apart
and
swing
the
great
sledge
to
whose
diapason
george
beats
a
tinkling
melody
coming
in
after
each
stroke
with
a
ring
and
clash
exact
and
true
as
is
and
has
been
the
way
of
masters
of
the
smithing
craft
all
the
world
over
from
time
immemorial
george
said
i
during
a
momentary
lull
leaning
my
hands
upon
the
long
you
do
sing
no
no
peter
and
why
not
i
think
peter
but
surely
you
can
both
think
and
sing
george
not
always
peter
what
your
trouble
george
no
trouble
peter
said
he
above
the
roar
of
the
bellows
then
sing
george
ay
jarge
sing
nodded
the
ancient
is
a
poor
as
never
rejices
an
that
in
the
scripters
so
sing
jarge
george
did
not
answer
but
with
a
turn
of
his
mighty
wrist
drew
the
glowing
iron
from
the
fire
and
once
more
the
sparks
fly
the
air
is
full
of
the
clink
of
hammers
and
the
song
of
the
anvil
in
which
even
the
ancient
joins
in
a
voice
somewhat
quavery
and
generally
a
note
or
two
behind
but
with
great
gusto
and
goodwill
notwithstanding
strike
ding
ding
strike
ding
ding
in
the
middle
of
which
i
was
aware
of
one
entering
to
us
and
presently
turning
round
espied
prudence
with
a
great
basket
on
her
arm
hereupon
hammers
were
thrown
aside
and
we
straightened
our
backs
for
in
that
basket
was
our
supper
very
fair
and
sweet
prudence
looked
lithe
and
vigorous
and
straight
as
a
young
poplar
with
her
shining
black
hair
curling
into
little
tight
rings
about
her
ears
and
with
great
shy
eyes
and
red
red
mouth
surely
a
man
might
seek
very
far
ere
he
found
such
another
maid
as
this
village
beauty
good
evening
mr
peter
said
she
dropping
me
a
curtesy
with
a
grace
that
could
not
have
been
surpassed
by
any
duchess
in
the
land
but
as
for
poor
george
she
did
not
even
notice
him
neither
did
he
raise
his
curly
head
nor
glance
toward
her
you
come
just
when
you
are
most
needed
prudence
said
i
relieving
her
of
the
heavy
basket
for
here
be
two
hungry
men
three
broke
in
the
ancient
so
as
a
lion
be
three
hungry
men
prudence
who
have
been
hearkening
for
your
step
this
and
more
quoth
prudence
shyly
for
the
sake
of
my
basket
ay
for
sure
croaked
the
ancient
so
ravenous
as
a
tiger
i
be
no
said
i
shaking
my
head
basket
or
no
basket
you
are
equally
welcome
prudence
how
say
you
george
but
george
only
mumbled
in
his
beard
the
ancient
and
i
now
set
to
work
putting
up
an
extemporized
table
but
as
for
george
he
stood
staring
down
moodily
into
the
yet
glowing
embers
of
the
forge
having
put
up
the
table
i
crossed
to
where
prudence
was
busy
unpacking
her
basket
prudence
said
i
are
you
still
at
odds
with
george
prudence
nodded
but
said
i
he
is
such
a
splendid
fellow
his
outburst
the
other
day
was
quite
natural
under
the
circumstances
surely
you
can
forgive
him
prudence
there
be
more
nor
that
betwixt
us
peter
sighed
prue
is
his
drinkin
six
months
ago
he
promised
me
never
to
touch
another
drop
an
he
broke
his
word
wi
me
but
surely
good
ale
in
moderation
will
harm
no
man
nay
on
the
contrary
but
jarge
bea
like
other
men
mr
peter
no
he
is
much
bigger
and
stronger
said
i
and
i
never
saw
a
handsomer
fellow
yes
nodded
the
girl
so
strong
as
a
giant
an
so
weak
as
a
little
child
indeed
prudence
said
i
leaning
nearer
to
her
in
my
earnestness
i
think
you
are
a
little
unjust
to
him
so
far
as
i
know
him
george
is
anything
but
or
liable
to
be
led
into
anything
hearing
the
ancient
chuckle
gleefully
i
glanced
up
to
find
him
nodding
and
winking
to
black
george
who
stood
with
folded
arms
and
bent
head
watching
us
from
beneath
his
brows
and
as
his
eyes
met
mine
i
thought
they
gleamed
strangely
in
the
firelight
come
prue
said
the
ancient
bustling
forward
table
ready
sit
down
an
eat
faintin
an
famishin
away
i
be
so
we
presently
sat
down
all
three
of
us
while
prudence
carved
and
supplied
our
wants
as
only
prudence
could
and
after
a
while
our
hunger
being
appeased
i
took
out
my
pipe
as
did
the
ancient
and
george
theirs
likewise
and
together
we
filled
them
slowly
and
carefully
as
pipes
should
be
filled
while
prudence
folded
a
long
paper
spill
wherewith
to
light
them
the
which
she
proceeded
to
do
beginning
at
her
grandfather
churchwarden
now
while
she
was
lighting
mine
black
george
suddenly
rose
and
crossing
to
the
forge
took
thence
a
glowing
coal
with
the
tongs
thus
doing
the
office
for
himself
all
at
once
i
saw
prue
hand
was
trembling
and
the
spill
was
dropped
or
ever
my
tobacco
was
well
alight
then
she
turned
swiftly
away
and
began
replacing
the
plates
and
knives
and
forks
in
her
basket
be
you
prue
inquired
the
ancient
mumblingly
for
his
pipe
was
in
full
blast
yes
then
tell
simon
as
i
be
along
in
an
hour
or
so
will
lass
yes
always
with
her
back
to
us
then
kiss
ye
old
grandfeyther
as
loves
an
means
for
to
see
well
bestowed
an
wed
one
o
these
fine
days
prudence
stooped
and
pressed
her
fresh
red
lips
to
his
wrinkled
old
cheek
and
catching
up
her
basket
turned
to
the
door
yet
not
so
quickly
but
that
i
had
caught
the
gleam
of
tears
beneath
her
lashes
black
george
half
rose
from
his
seat
and
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
her
burden
then
sat
down
again
as
with
a
hasty
good
night
she
vanished
through
the
yawning
doorway
and
sitting
there
we
listened
to
her
quick
light
footstep
cross
the
road
to
the
bull
she
make
some
man
a
fine
wife
some
day
exclaimed
the
ancient
blowing
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
ay
she
mak
some
man
as
fine
a
wife
as
ever
was
some
day
you
speak
my
very
thought
ancient
said
i
she
will
indeed
what
do
you
think
george
but
george
answer
was
to
choke
suddenly
and
thereafter
to
fall
smoke
go
t
wrong
way
jarge
inquired
the
ancient
fixing
him
with
his
bright
eye
ay
nodded
george
ha
said
the
old
man
and
we
smoked
for
a
time
in
silence
so
as
a
picter
she
be
said
the
ancient
suddenly
she
is
fairer
than
any
picture
said
i
impulsively
and
what
is
better
still
her
nature
is
as
sweet
and
beautiful
as
her
face
do
know
that
said
george
turning
sharply
upon
me
my
eyes
and
ears
tell
me
so
as
yours
surely
must
have
done
long
ago
i
answered
ye
do
think
as
she
be
a
purty
lass
then
peter
inquired
the
ancient
i
think
said
i
that
she
is
the
prettiest
lass
i
ever
saw
you
think
so
george
but
again
george
only
answer
was
to
choke
smoke
again
jarge
inquired
the
ancient
ay
said
george
as
before
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
young
said
the
ancient
after
a
somewhat
lengthy
pause
and
with
a
wave
of
his
long
a
very
fine
thing
it
is
said
i
though
we
generally
realize
it
all
too
late
as
for
george

went
on
smoking

do

o

a
truly
happy
one
ancient
ah
that

a
providence
in

i
were
a
fine
young
chap
in
them
days
summat
o
your

only

though
i
were
allus
at
beck
an
call
i
could
never
pluck
the
courage
to

for
a
year
or

maybe
till
one
day

dumplings
peter
says
she
lookin

martin
says
she
an
so
we
was
married
peter
an
as
you
see
theer
was
a
providence
in
it
for
if
the
first
one
married
some
else
an
the
second
died
i
might
ha
married
one
o
they
repented
it
all
my
days
for
i
were
young
then
an
fulish
peter
fulish
so
saying
the
ancient
rose
sighing
and
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
talkin
prue
said
he
taking
up
his
hat
and
removing
his
therefrom
ere
he
set
it
upon
his
head
talkin
prue
he
repeated
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
at
his
nostrils
well
the
word
seemed
shot
out
of
george
involuntarily
talkin
prue
said
the
ancient
again
glancing
at
each
of
us
in
turn
theer
was
some
folks
as
used
to
think
she
were
sweet
on
jarge
theer
but
i
bein
lawful
knowed
different
did
i
jarge
ay
nodded
the
smith
many
the
time
i
said
to
you
in
this
very
corner
i
said
my
words
jarge
if
ever
my

there
some
wo

my
very
words

very
words
gaffer
nodded
george
well
then
continued
the
old
man
what
i
was
to
prue
been
an
fell
in
love
wi
some
at
last
black
george
pipe
shivered
to
fragments
on
the
floor
and
as
he
leaned
forward
i
saw
that
his
great
hands
were
tightly
clenched
gaffer
said
he
in
a
strangled
voice
what
do
mean
i
means
what
i
says
jarge
how
do
know
bea
i
the
lass
be
ye
sure
gaffer
quite
sure
ay
sartin
sure
twice
this
week
an
once
the
week
afore
she
forgot
to
put
any
salt
in
the
soup
an
that
speaks
wollums
jarge
wollums
here
having
replaced
his
the
ancient
put
on
his
hat
nodded
and
bobbled
away
as
for
black
george
he
sat
there
staring
blindly
before
him
long
after
the
tapping
of
the
ancient
stick
had
died
away
nor
did
he
heed
me
when
i
spoke
wherefore
i
laid
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
come
george
said
i
another
hour
and
the
screen
will
be
finished
he
started
and
drawing
from
my
hand
looked
up
at
me
very
strangely
no
peter
he
mumbled
i
are
to
work
no
more
tonight
and
as
he
spoke
he
rose
to
his
feet
what
are
you
going
said
i
as
he
crossed
to
the
door
ay
i
now
as
he
went
towards
his
cottage
i
saw
him
reel
and
stagger
like
a
drunken
man
chapter
xxxiii
in
which
we
draw
yet
nearer
to
the
end
of
this
first
book
it
is
not
my
intention
to
chronicle
all
those
minor
happenings
that
befell
me
now
or
afterward
lest
this
history
prove
wearisome
to
the
reader
on
the
which
head
i
begin
to
entertain
grave
doubts
already
suffice
it
then
that
as
the
days
grew
into
weeks
and
the
weeks
into
months
by
perseverance
i
became
reasonably
expert
at
my
trade
so
that
some
two
months
after
my
meeting
with
black
george
i
could
shoe
a
horse
with
any
smith
in
the
country
but
more
than
this
the
people
with
whom
i
associated
day
by
day
honest
loyal
and
as
they
were
contented
with
their
lot
and
receiving
all
things
so
unquestioningly
and
thankfully
filled
my
life
and
brought
a
great
calm
to
a
mind
that
had
hitherto
been
somewhat
and
troubled
by
pessimistic
doubts
and
fantastic
dreams
culled
from
musty
pages
what
book
is
there
to
compare
with
the
great
book
of
life
whose
pages
are
forever
wherein
are
marvels
and
wonders
undreamed
things
to
weep
over
and
some
few
to
laugh
at
if
one
but
has
eyes
in
one
head
to
see
withal
to
walk
through
the
whispering
cornfields
or
the
long
green
alleys
of
the
with
simon
who
combines
innkeeping
with
farming
to
hear
him
tell
of
fruit
and
flower
of
bird
and
beast
is
better
than
to
read
the
georgics
of
virgil
to
sit
in
the
sunshine
and
watch
the
ancient
pipe
in
mouth
to
hearken
to
his
animadversions
upon
life
and
death
and
humanity
is
better
than
the
cynical
wit
of
rochefoucauld
or
a
page
out
of
honest
old
montaigne
to
see
the
proud
poise
of
sweet
prue
averted
head
and
the
tender
look
in
her
eyes
when
george
is
near
and
the
surge
of
the
mighty
chest
and
the
tremble
of
the
strong
man
hand
at
the
sound
of
her
light
footfall
is
more
enthralling
than
any
written
romance
old
or
new
in
regard
to
these
latter
i
began
at
this
time
to
contrive
schemes
and
to
plot
plots
for
bringing
them
together
to
bridge
over
the
difficulty
which
separated
them
for
being
happy
i
would
fain
see
them
happy
also
now
how
i
succeeded
in
this
task
the
reader
if
he
trouble
to
read
far
enough
shall
see
for
himself
george
said
i
on
a
certain
saturday
morning
as
i
washed
the
grime
from
my
face
and
hands
are
you
going
to
the
fair
this
afternoon
no
peter
i
are
but
prudence
is
going
said
i
drying
myself
vigorously
upon
the
towel
and
how
inquired
the
smith
bending
in
turn
above
the
bucket
in
which
we
performed
our
ablutions
and
how
might
you
know
that
peter
because
she
told
me
so
told
you
so
did
she
said
george
and
immediately
plunged
his
head
into
the
bucket
she
did
i
answered
and
supposin
said
george
coming
up
very
red
in
the
face
and
with
the
water
streaming
from
his
sodden
curls
supposin
she
is
goin
to
the
fair
what
that
to
me
i
do
care
wheer
she
comes
no
nor
wheer
she
goes
neither
and
he
shook
the
water
from
him
as
a
dog
might
are
you
quite
sure
george
ah
sartin
sure
i
been
sure
of
it
now
ever
since
she
called
me
pooh
nonsense
man
she
did
mean
it
women
especially
young
ones
often
say
things
they
do
not
mean
at
least
so
i
am
given
to
understand
ay
but
she
did
mean
it
said
george
frowning
and
nodding
his
head
but
it
ai
that
peter
no
it
are
that
it
the
knowin
as
she
spoke
truth
when
she
called
me
and
despisin
me
for
it
in
heart
that
wheer
it
is
peter
nevertheless
i
sure
she
never
meant
it
george
then
let
come
and
tell
me
so
i
do
think
she
do
that
said
i
no
more
do
i
peter
saying
which
he
fell
to
work
with
the
towel
even
as
i
had
done
george
said
i
after
a
silence
well
peter
has
it
ever
struck
you
that
prudence
is
an
uncommonly
handsome
girl
to
be
sure
it
peter
i
were
blind
else
and
that
other
men
may
see
this
too
well
peter
and
some
one
even
tell
her
so
his
answer
was
a
long
time
coming
but
come
it
did
at
last
well
peter
and
ask
her
to
marry
him
george
this
time
he
was
silent
so
long
that
i
had
tied
my
neckerchief
and
drawn
on
my
coat
ere
he
spoke
very
heavily
and
slowly
and
without
looking
at
me
why
then
peter
let
i
told
afore
i
do
care
wheer
she
comes
nor
wheer
she
goes
she
bea
nothin
to
me
no
more
nor
i
to
she
if
so
be
some
man
a
mind
to
ax
for
all
open
an
aboveboard
i
say
again
let
and
now
let
talk
o
summat
else
willingly
there
to
be
boxing
and
and
wrestling
at
the
fair
i
understand
ay
and
they
tell
me
there
is
a
famous
wrestler
coming
all
the
way
from
cornwall
to
wrestle
the
best
man
for
ten
guineas
ay
so
there
be
well
well
peter
they
were
talking
about
it
at
bull
last
night
bull
to
be
sure
you
was
at

chapter
xxxiv
which
describes
sundry
happenings
at
the
fair
and
ends
this
first
book
i
say
young
cove
where
are
you
of
the
speaker
was
a
very
tall
individual
whose
elbow
had
more
than
once
obtruded
itself
into
my
ribs
he
was
extremely
thin
and
bony
with
a
long
drooping
nose
set
very
much
to
one
side
and
was
possessed
of
a
remarkable
pair
of
eyes
that
is
to
say
one
eyelid
hung
continually
lower
than
the
other
thus
lending
to
his
otherwise
sinister
face
an
air
of
droll
and
unexpected
waggery
that
was
quite
startling
to
behold
all
about
us
were
jostling
throngs
of
men
and
women
in
snowy
smock
frocks
and
holiday
gowns
who
pushed
or
were
pushed
laughed
or
frowned
according
to
their
several
natures
while
above
the
merry
hubbub
rose
the
blare
of
trumpets
the
braying
of
horns
and
the
crash
and
rattle
of
drums
in
a
word
i
was
in
the
middle
of
an
english
country
fair
now
then
young
cove
repeated
the
man
i
have
alluded
to
where
are
you
of
do
do
it
again
or
mind
your
eye
and
saying
this
he
glared
balefully
at
me
with
one
eye
and
leered
jocosely
with
the
other
and
into
my
ribs
came
his
elbow
again
you
seem
to
be
able
to
do
something
in
that
way
yourself
i
retorted
oh
do
i
yes
said
i
suppose
you
take
your
elbow
out
of
my
waistcoat
repeated
the
man
what
d
mean
by
this
said
i
catching
his
arm
in
no
very
gentle
grip
if
it
a
fight
you
wantin
began
the
man
it
is
said
i
then
leggo
my
arm
then
keep
your
elbow
to
yourself
i
never
see
such
a
cove
nor
i
a
more
one
this
altercation
had
taken
place
as
we
swayed
to
and
fro
in
the
crowd
from
which
we
now
slowly
won
free
owing
chiefly
to
the
dexterous
use
of
the
man
bony
elbows
until
we
presently
found
ourselves
in
a
veritable
jungle
of
carts
and
wagons
of
all
kinds
and
sorts
where
we
stopped
facing
each
other
i
inclined
to
think
young
cove
as
you
be
if
you
been
shied
at
by
your
from
your
youth
up
said
the
man
what
do
you
mean
by
at
what
i
sez
some
perfessions
is
easy
and
some
is
like
mine
and
what
is
yours
i
a
perfessional
sambo
a
what
well
a
then
blacks
my
face
sticks
my
through
a
and
lets
shy
at
me
three
shies
a
penny
them
as
me
gets
a
cigar
a
big
them
as
do
do
yours
is
a
very
unpleasant
profession
said
i
a
man
must
live
but
said
i
supposing
you
get
hit
them
as
me
gets
a
cigar
does
it
hurt
you
oh
you
gets
used
to
it
though
to
be
sure
they
do
me
very
often
or
it
would
be
a
loss
cigars
is
expensive
leastways
they
costs
money
but
surely
a
wooden
image
would
serve
your
turn
just
as
well
a
wooden
image
exclaimed
the
man
disgustedly
james
you
must
be
a
fool
you
must
who
wants
to
throw
at
a
wooden
image
you
ca
a
wooden
image
can
you
if
you
throwed
at
a
wooden
image
that
there
wooden
image
would
flinch
would
it
when
a
man
throws
at
anything
likes
to
it
that
and
when
it
likes
to
see
it
flinch
that
too
and
when
it
flinches
why
rubs
and
takes
another
shot
and
that
the
of
all
so
you
see
young
cove
you
a
fool
with
your
wooden
image
now
as
he
ended
i
stooped
very
suddenly
and
caught
hold
of
his
wrist
and
then
i
saw
that
he
held
my
purse
in
his
hand
it
was
a
large
hand
with
bony
knuckles
and
very
long
fingers
upon
one
of
which
was
a
battered
ring
he
attempted
at
first
to
free
himself
of
my
grip
but
finding
this
useless
stood
glowering
at
me
with
one
eye
and
leering
with
the
other
ha
said
i
hallo
said
he
a
purse
said
i
why
so
it
is
he
nodded
leastways
it
looks
uncommonly
like
one
do
it
what
more
it
looks
like
mine
does
it
i
could
swear
to
it
anywhere
could
you
i
could
then
you
better
take
it
young
cove
and
very
welcome
sure
so
you
been
picking
my
pocket
said
i
never
picked
a
pocket
in
my
life
should
scorn
to
i
put
away
my
recovered
property
and
straightway
shifted
my
grip
to
the
fellow
collar
now
said
i
come
on
why
what
are
you
of
what
does
one
generally
do
with
a
pickpocket
but
i
had
hardly
uttered
the
words
when
with
a
sudden
cunning
twist
he
broke
my
hold
and
my
foot
catching
in
a
i
tripped
and
fell
heavily
and
ere
i
could
rise
he
had
made
good
his
escape
i
got
to
my
feet
somewhat
shaken
by
the
fall
yet
congratulating
myself
on
the
recovery
of
my
purse
and
threading
my
way
among
the
tents
was
soon
back
among
the
crowd
here
were
circuses
and
shows
of
all
kinds
where
one
might
behold
divers
strange
beasts
the
usual
fat
women
and
skeleton
men
who
ever
heard
of
the
order
being
reversed
and
before
the
shows
were
fellows
variously
attired
but
each
being
purplish
of
visage
and
each
possessing
the
lungs
of
a
stentor
more
especially
one
a
fellow
in
a
white
hat
who
alternately
roared
and
beat
upon
a
drum
a
man
he
was
with
a
fiery
eye
which
eye
chancing
to
single
me
out
in
the
crowd
fixed
itself
pertinaciously
upon
me
thenceforth
so
that
he
seemed
to
address
himself
exclusively
to
me
thus
o
my
stars
young
man
bang
goes
the
drum
the
wonderful
wild
and
savage
man
from
bonhoola
as
eats
snakes
alive
and
dresses
hisself
in
sheeny
serpents
o
my
eye
step
up
young
man

likewise
the
and
beautiful

to

playfully
spittin

and
sulphurous
smoke
and
all
for
sixpence
young
man
bang
o
my
stars
step
up
young
man
and
all
for
a
tanner
bang
presently
his
eye
being
off
me
for
the
moment
i
edged
my
way
out
of
the
throng
and
so
came
to
where
a
man
stood
mounted
upon
a
cart
beside
him
was
a
fellow
in
a
clown
habit
who
blew
loudly
three
times
upon
a
trumpet
which
done
the
man
took
off
his
hat
and
began
to
harangue
the
crowd
something
in
this
wise
i
come
before
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
not
for
vulgar
gain
or
as
i
might
say
kudos
which
is
eyetalian
for
the
same
not
to
put
my
hands
into
your
pockets
and
rifle
of
your
honestly
earned
money
no
i
come
before
you
for
the
good
of
each
one
of
you
for
the
easing
of
suffering
mankind
as
i
might
say
the
of
stricken
humanity
in
a
word
i
am
here
to
introduce
to
you
what
i
call
my
elixir
anthropos
anthropos
ladies
and
gentlemen
is
an
old
and
very
ancient
egyptian
word
meaning
man
or
woman
for
that
matter
etc
during
this
exordium
i
had
noticed
a
venerable
man
in
a
fine
blue
surtout
and
a
hat
who
sat
upon
the
shaft
of
a
cart
and
puffed
slowly
at
a
great
pipe
and
as
he
puffed
he
listened
intently
to
the
address
and
from
time
to
time
his
eyes
would
twinkle
and
his
lips
curve
in
an
ironic
smile
the
cart
upon
the
shaft
of
which
he
sat
stood
close
to
a
very
small
dirty
and
tent
towards
which
the
old
gentleman
back
was
turned
now
as
i
watched
i
saw
the
point
of
a
knife
gleam
through
the
dirty
canvas
which
vanishing
gave
place
to
a
hand
protruded
through
the
slit
thus
made
a
very
large
hand
with
bony
knuckles
and
long
fingers
upon
one
of
which
was
a
battered
ring
for
an
instant
the
hand
hovered
undecidedly
then
darted
forward
the
long
skirts
of
the
old
gentleman
coat
hardly
stirred
yet
even
as
i
watched
i
saw
the
hand
vanish
with
a
fat
purse
in
its
clutches
skirting
the
tent
i
came
round
to
the
opening
and
stooping
peered
cautiously
inside
there
sure
enough
was
my
pickpocket
gazing
intently
into
the
open
purse
and
chuckling
as
he
gazed
then
he
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
and
out
he
came
where
i
immediately
pinned
him
by
the
neckerchief
and
after
a
while
finding
he
could
not
again
break
my
hold
he
lay
still
beneath
me
panting
and
as
he
lay
his
one
eye
glared
more
balefully
and
his
other
leered
more
waggishly
than
ever
as
i
thrusting
my
hand
into
his
pocket
took
thence
the
purse
and
transferred
it
to
my
own
halves
mate
he
panted
halves
and
we
cry
by
no
means
said
i
rising
to
my
feet
but
keeping
my
grip
upon
him
then
what
your
game
i
intend
to
hand
you
over
as
a
pickpocket
that
means
said
he
wiping
the
blood
from
his
face
for
the
struggle
though
short
had
been
sharp
enough
well
said
i
it
go
with
the
babby
baby
i
exclaimed
ah
or
the
hinfant
if
you
like
it
better
one
as
i
found
in
a
shawl
on
the
steps
o
my
van
one
night
sleeping
like
a
alderman
and
it
were
snowing
too
yet
you
are
a
thief
we
calls
it
and
ought
to
be
given
up
to
the
authorities
and
who
to
look
arter
the
babby
are
you
married
no
where
is
the
baby
in
my
van
and
where
is
that
yonder
and
he
pointed
to
a
caravan
that
stood
near
by
asleep
now
but
if
you
like
to
take
a
peep
at
i
should
said
whereupon
the
fellow
led
me
to
his
van
and
following
him
up
the
steps
i
entered
a
place
which
though
confined
was
wonderfully
neat
and
clean
with
curtains
at
the
open
windows
a
rug
upon
the
floor
and
an
ornamental
brass
lamp
pendent
from
the
roof
at
the
far
end
was
a
bed
or
rather
berth
curtained
with
chintz
and
upon
this
bed
his
chubby
face
pillowed
upon
a
dimpled
fist
lay
a
very
small
man
indeed
and
looking
up
from
him
to
the
very
large
bony
man
bending
over
him
i
surprised
a
look
upon
the
hardened
face
a
tenderness
that
seemed
very
much
out
of
place
nice
and
fat
ai
said
the
man
touching
the
baby
applelike
cheek
with
a
grimy
finger
yes
ah
and
so
should
be
james
but
should
see
eat
a
alderman
nothing
to
lewis
i
calls
lewis
for
at
lewisham
i
found
on
a
christmas
eve
snowing
it
was
but
by
james
it
did
bother
not
a
bit
and
why
did
you
keep
him
there
was
the
parish

the
man
bitterly
i

brought
up
by
the
parish
myself
and
a
nice
job
they
made
o
me
do

find
him
a
great
trouble

exclaimed
the
man
lewis
ai
no
trouble

a
bit
never
was
and
he
great
company
when
i
on
the
move
from
one
town
to
another
larning
to
talk
now
said
i
when
we
had
descended
from
the
van
i
propose
to
return
this
purse
to
the
owner
if
he
is
to
be
found
if
not
i
shall
hand
it
to
the
proper
authorities
walker
exclaimed
the
man
you
shall
yourself
witness
the
restitution
said
i
unheeding
his
remark
after
which
well
said
he
glancing
back
toward
his
caravan
and
moistening
his
lips
as
i
tightened
my
grip
upon
his
arm
what
about
me
you
can
go
for
lewis
sake
if
you
will
give
me
your
word
to
live
honestly
henceforth
you
have
it
sir
i
swear
it
on
the
bible
if
you
like
then
let
us
seek
the
owner
of
this
purse
so
coming
in
a
while
to
where
the
quack
doctor
was
still
holding
forth
there
yet
seated
upon
the
shaft
of
the
cart
puffing
at
his
great
pipe
was
the
venerable
man
at
sight
of
him
the
pickpocket
stopped
and
caught
my
arm
come
master
said
he
come
you
never
mean
to
give
up
all
that
good
money
there
fifty
guineas
and
more
in
that
purse
all
the
more
reason
to
return
it
said
i
no
do
do
go
good
money
like
that
it
like
throwing
it
away
but
shaking
off
the
fellow
importunate
hand
i
approached
and
saluted
the
venerable
man
sir
said
i
you
have
had
your
pocket
picked
he
turned
and
regarded
me
with
a
pair
of
very
bright
eyes
and
blew
a
whiff
of
smoke
slowly
into
the
air
sir
he
replied
i
found
that
out
five
minutes
ago
the
fact
seems
to
trouble
you
very
little
said
i
there
sir
being
young
and
judging
exteriorly
you
are
wrong
there
is
recounted
somewhere
in
the
classics
an
altogether
incredible
story
of
a
spartan
youth
and
a
fox
the
boy
with
the
animal
hid
beneath
his
cloak
preserved
an
unruffled
demeanor
despite
the
animal
tearing
teeth
until
he
fell
down
and
died
in
the
same
way
young
sir
no
man
can
lose
guineas
from
his
pocket
and
remain
unaffected
by
the
loss
then
sir
said
i
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
return
your
purse
to
you
he
took
it
opened
it
glanced
over
its
contents
looked
at
me
took
out
two
guineas
looked
at
me
again
put
the
money
back
closed
the
purse
and
dropping
it
into
his
pocket
bowed
his
acknowledgment
having
done
which
he
made
room
for
me
to
sit
beside
him
sir
said
he
chuckling
hark
to
that
lovely
rascal
in
the
cart
yonder
hark
to
him
galen
was
an
ass
and
hippocrates
a
dunce
beside
this
fellow
hark
to
him
there
nothing
like
pills
the
was
saying
at
the
top
of
his
voice
place
one
upon
the
tip
o
the
tongue
in
this
fashion
take
a
drink
o
water
beer
or
wine
as
the
case
may
be
give
a
couple
swallers
and
there
you
are
oh
there
nothing
in
the
world
like
pills
and
there
nothing
like
my
elixir
anthropos
for
coughs
colds
and
the
rheumatics
for
sore
throats
sore
eyes
sore
backs
good
for
the
croup
measles
and
a
certain
cure
for
dropsy
scurvy
and
the
king
evil
there
no
disease
or
ailment
discovered
or
invented
as
my
pills
wo
soothe
heal
and
charm
away
and
all
i
charge
is
one
shilling
a
box
hand
round
jonas
whereupon
the
fellow
in
the
clown
dress
stepping
down
from
the
cart
began
handing
out
the
boxes
of
pills
and
taking
in
the
shillings
as
fast
as
he
conveniently
could
a
thriving
trade
said
my
venerable
companion
it
always
has
been
and
always
will
for
humanity
is
a
fool
and
loves
to
be
these
honest
folk
are
probably
paying
for
bread
pellets
compounded
with
a
little
soap
yet
will
go
home
swallow
them
in
all
good
faith
and
think
themselves
a
great
deal
better
for
them
and
therefore
said
i
probably
derive
as
much
benefit
from
them
as
from
any
drug
yet
discovered
young
man
said
my
companion
giving
me
a
sharp
glance
what
do
you
mean
plainly
sir
that
a
man
who
believes
himself
cured
of
a
disease
is
surely
on
the
high
road
to
recovery
but
a
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
that
rascal
bread
pellets
can
not
make
them
anything
but
bread
pellets
no
said
i
but
it
may
effect
great
things
with
the
disease
young
man
do
tell
me
that
you
are
a
believer
in
faith
healing
and
tomfoolery
disease
is
a
great
and
terrible
reality
and
must
be
met
and
overcome
by
a
real
means
on
the
contrary
sir
may
it
not
be
rather
the
outcome
of
a
preconceived
idea
of
a
belief
that
has
been
held
universally
for
many
ages
and
generations
of
men
i
do
not
deny
disease
who
could
but
suffering
and
disease
have
been
looked
upon
from
the
earliest
days
as
punishments
wrought
out
upon
a
man
for
his
sins
now
may
not
the
haunting
fear
of
this
retributive
justice
be
greatly
responsible
for
suffering
and
disease
of
all
kinds
since
the
mind
unquestionably
reacts
upon
the
body
probably
sir
probably
but
since
disease
is
with
us
how
would
you
propose
to
remedy
it
by
disbelieving
in
it
by
regarding
it
as
something
abnormal
and
utterly
foreign
to
the
divine
order
of
things
pooh
exclaimed
my
venerable
companion
bah
quite
quite
impracticable
they
say
the
same
of
sermon
on
the
mount
sir
i
retorted
can
a
man
wasting
away
in
a
decline
discredit
the
fact
that
he
is
dying
with
every
breath
he
draws
had
you
or
i
or
any
man
the
to
teach
him
a
disbelief
in
his
sickness
then
would
he
be
hale
and
well
the
great
physician
healed
all
diseases
thus
without
the
aid
of
drugs
seeking
only
to
implant
in
the
mind
of
each
sufferer
the
knowledge
that
he
was
whole
and
sound
that
is
to
say
a
total
disbelief
in
his
malady
how
many
times
do
we
read
the
words
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
all
he
demanded
of
them
was
faith
or
as
i
say
a
disbelief
in
their
disease
then
the
cures
of
christ
were
not
miracles
no
more
so
than
any
great
and
noble
work
is
a
miracle
and
do
you
inquired
my
companion
removing
his
pipe
from
his
lips
and
staring
at
me
very
hard
do
you
believe
that
jesus
christ
was
the
son
of
god
yes
said
i
in
the
same
way
that
you
and
i
are
and
the
yonder
but
was
he
divine
surely
a
mighty
thinker
a
great
teacher
whose
hand
points
the
higher
way
whose
words
inspire
humanity
to
nobler
ends
and
aims
is
of
necessity
divine
you
are
a
very
bold
young
man
and
talk
i
think
a
little
wildly
heterodoxy
has
been
styled
so
before
sir
and
a
very
young
young
man
that
sir
will
be
amended
by
time
here
puffing
at
his
pipe
and
finding
it
gone
out
he
looked
at
me
in
surprise
remarkable
said
he
what
is
sir
while
i
listened
to
you
i
have
actually
let
my
pipe
go
out
a
thing
which
rarely
happens
with
me
as
he
spoke
he
thrust
one
hand
into
his
pocket
when
he
glance
slowly
all
round
and
back
once
more
to
me
remarkable
said
he
again
what
now
sir
my
purse
has
gone
again
what
gone
i
ejaculated
vanished
said
he
and
to
prove
his
words
turned
inside
out
first
one
pocket
and
then
the
other
come
with
me
said
i
springing
up
there
is
yet
a
chance
that
we
may
possibly
recover
it
forthwith
i
led
him
to
where
had
stood
a
certain
caravan
but
it
was
gone
vanished
as
utterly
as
my
companion
purse
most
annoying
said
he
shaking
his
venerable
head
really
most
exasperating
i
particularly
wished
to
secure
a
sample
of
that
pills
the
collection
of
quack
remedies
is
a
fad
of
mine
as
it
is
my
purse
is
entirely
at
your
disposal
sir
said
i
though
to
be
sure
a
very
but
there
i
stopped
staring
in
my
turn
blankly
at
him
ha
he
exclaimed
his
eyes
twinkling
yes
i
nodded
the
rascal
made
off
with
my
purse
also
we
are
companions
in
misfortune
then
as
such
young
sir
come
and
dine
with
me
my
habitation
is
but
a
little
way
off
thank
you
sir
but
i
am
half
expecting
to
meet
with
certain
good
friends
of
mine
though
i
am
none
the
less
honored
by
your
offer
so
be
it
young
sir
then
permit
me
to
wish
you
a
very
day
and
touching
the
brim
of
his
hat
with
the
long
stem
of
his
pipe
the
venerable
man
turned
and
left
me
howbeit
though
i
looked
diligently
on
all
hands
i
saw
nothing
of
simon
or
the
ancient
thus
evening
was
falling
as
bending
my
steps
homeward
i
came
to
a
part
of
the
fair
where
had
been
set
up
and
where
they
were
preparing
to
roast
an
ox
whole
as
is
the
immemorial
custom
drinking
was
going
on
with
its
usual
accompaniment
of
boisterous
merriment
and
rough
horseplay
the
vulgarity
of
which
ever
annoys
me
two
or
three
times
i
was
rudely
jostled
as
i
made
my
way
along
so
that
my
temper
was
already
something
the
worse
when
turning
aside
to
avoid
all
this
i
came
full
upon
two
fellows
farmers
by
their
look
who
held
a
struggling
girl
between
them
to
each
of
whom
i
reached
out
a
hand
and
gripping
them
firmly
by
their
collars
brought
their
two
heads
together
with
a
sounding
crack
and
then
i
saw
that
the
girl
was
prudence
next
moment
we
were
running
hand
in
hand
with
the
two
fellows
roaring
in
pursuit
but
prudence
was
wonderfully
fleet
and
light
of
foot
wherefore
doubling
and
turning
among
carts
tents
and
booths
we
had
soon
outstripped
our
pursuers
and
rid
ourselves
of
them
altogether
in
spite
of
which
prudence
still
ran
on
till
catching
her
foot
in
some
obstacle
she
tripped
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
my
arm
and
looking
down
into
her
flushed
face
glowing
through
the
sweet
disorder
of
her
glossy
curls
i
could
not
but
think
how
lovely
she
was
but
as
i
watched
the
color
fled
from
her
cheeks
her
eyes
dilated
and
she
started
away
from
me
now
turning
hastily
i
saw
that
we
were
standing
close
by
a
certain
small
dirty
and
tent
the
canvas
of
which
had
been
slit
with
a
knife
and
my
movement
had
been
quick
enough
to
enable
me
to
see
a
face
vanish
through
the
canvas
and
fleeting
though
the
glimpse
had
been
yet
in
the
lowering
brow
the
baleful
glare
of
the
eye
and
the
set
of
the
great
jaw
i
had
seen
death
and
after
we
had
walked
on
a
while
together
looking
at
prue
i
noticed
that
she
trembled
oh
peter
she
whispered
glancing
back
over
her
shoulder
did
ye
see
yes
prudence
i
saw
and
speaking
i
also
glanced
back
towards
the
villainous
little
tent
and
though
the
face
appeared
no
more
i
was
aware
nevertheless
of
a
sudden
misgiving
that
was
almost
like
a
foreboding
of
evil
to
come
for
in
those
features
disfigured
though
they
were
with
black
rage
and
passion
i
had
recognized
the
face
of
black
george
a
word
to
the
reader
remembering
the
very
excellent
advice
of
my
friend
the
tinker
as
to
the
writing
of
a
good
i
am
perturbed
and
not
a
little
discouraged
upon
looking
over
these
pages
to
find
that
i
have
as
yet
described
no
desperate
encounters
no
hairbreadth
escapes
unless
a
bullet
through
one
hat
may
be
justly
so
regarded
and
above
all
not
one
word
of
love
you
sir
who
have
expectantly
borne
with
me
thus
far
may
be
tempted
to
close
the
book
in
a
huff
and
hurling
it
from
you
with
a
anathema
clap
on
your
hat
and
sally
forth
into
the
sunshine
or
you
madam
breathing
a
sigh
hopes
deferred
may
take
up
needle
and
silk
and
turn
you
once
again
to
that
embroidery
which
has
engaged
your
dainty
fingers
this
twelvemonth
and
more
yet
which
like
penelope
web
would
seem
no
nearer
completion
ah
well
sir
exercise
especially
walking
is
highly
beneficial
to
the
liver
they
tell
me
and
nothing
madam
believe
me
unless
it
be
playing
the
harp
can
show
off
a
pretty
hand
or
the
delicate
curves
of
a
shapely
wrist
and
arm
to
such
advantage
as
that
selfsame
embroidery
but
since
needlework
like
books
and
all
sublunary
things
is
apt
to
grow
monotonous
you
may
perchance
for
lack
of
better
occupation
be
driven
to
address
yourself
once
more
to
this
my
narrative
and
since
you
sir
no
matter
how
far
you
walk
must
of
necessity
return
to
your
chair
and
it
is
possible
that
having
dined
adequately
and
lighted
your
pipe
and
being
therefore
in
a
more
charitable
and
temperate
frame
of
mind
you
may
lift
my
volume
from
the
dusty
corner
where
it
has
lain
all
this
while
and
though
probably
with
sundry
grunts
and
snorts
indicative
that
the
thing
is
done
under
protest
as
it
were
reopen
these
pages
in
the
which
hope
dear
madam
and
you
noble
sir
i
here
commence
this
my
second
book
which
as
you
see
is
headed
thus
the
woman
book
two
the
woman
chapter
i
of
storm
and
tempest
and
of
the
coming
of
charmian
i
was
at
sea
in
an
open
boat
out
of
the
heaven
there
rushed
a
mighty
wind
and
the
seas
above
me
rose
high
and
ever
higher
flecked
with
hissing
white
wherefore
i
cast
me
face
downwards
in
my
little
boat
that
i
might
not
behold
the
horror
of
the
waters
and
above
their
ceaseless
surging
thunder
there
rose
a
cry
charmian
i
stood
upon
a
desolate
moor
and
the
pitiless
rain
lashed
me
and
the
fierce
wind
buffeted
me
and
out
of
the
gloom
where
frowning
earth
and
heaven
met
there
rose
a
cry
charmian
i
started
up
in
bed
broad
awake
and
listening
yet
the
tumult
was
all
about
me
still
the
hiss
and
beat
of
rain
and
the
sound
of
a
rushing
mighty
wind
a
wind
that
seemed
to
fill
the
earth
a
wind
that
screamed
about
me
that
howled
above
me
and
filled
the
woods
near
and
far
with
a
deep
booming
pierced
now
and
then
by
the
splintering
crash
of
snapping
bough
or
falling
tree
and
yet
somewhere
in
this
frightful
pandemonium
of
sound
blended
in
with
it
yet
not
of
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
cry
still
faintly
echoed
charmian
so
appalling
was
all
this
to
my
senses
that
i
remained
for
a
time
staring
into
the
darkness
as
one
dazed
presently
however
i
rose
and
donning
some
clothes
mended
the
fire
which
still
smouldered
upon
the
hearth
and
having
filled
and
lighted
my
pipe
sat
down
to
listen
to
the
awful
voices
of
the
storm
what
brain
could
conceive
what
pen
describe
that
elemental
chorus
like
the
mighty
voice
of
persecuted
humanity
past
and
present
crying
the
woes
and
ills
the
sorrows
and
torments
endured
of
all
the
ages
surely
the
souls
of
the
unnumbered
dead
rode
within
the
storm
and
this
was
the
voice
of
their
lamentation
from
the
red
mire
of
battlefields
are
they
come
from
the
flame
and
ravishment
of
fair
cities
from
dim
and
reeking
dungeons
from
the
rack
the
stake
and
the
gibbet
to
pierce
the
heavens
once
more
with
the
voice
of
their
agony
since
the
world
was
made
how
many
have
lived
and
suffered
and
died
unlettered
and
unsung
snatched
by
a
tyrant
whim
from
life
to
death
in
the
glory
of
the
sun
in
the
gloom
of
night
in
blood
and
flame
and
torment
indeed
their
name
is
legion
but
there
is
a
great
and
awful
book
whose
leaves
are
countless
yet
every
leaf
of
which
is
smirched
with
blood
and
fouled
with
nameless
sins
a
record
howsoever
brief
and
inadequate
of
human
suffering
wherein
as
through
a
glass
darkly
we
may
behold
horrors
unimagined
where
murder
stalks
and
rampant
lust
where
treachery
creeps
with
curving
back
smiling
mouth
and
sudden
deadly
hand
where
tyranny
and
grinds
the
nations
beneath
a
bloody
heel
truly
man
hath
no
enemy
like
man
and
christ
is
there
and
socrates
and
savonarola
and
there
too
is
a
cross
of
agony
a
bowl
of
hemlock
and
a
consuming
fire
oh
noble
martyrs
by
whose
blood
and
agony
the
world
is
become
a
purer
and
better
place
for
us
and
those
who
shall
come
after
us
oh
glorious
innumerable
host
thy
poor
maimed
bodies
were
dust
ages
since
but
thy
souls
live
on
in
paradise
and
thy
memory
abides
and
shall
abide
in
the
earth
forever
ye
purblind
ye
pessimists
existing
with
no
hope
of
a
resurrection
bethink
you
of
these
matters
go
open
the
great
and
awful
book
and
read
and
behold
these
things
for
yourselves
for
what
student
of
history
is
there
but
must
be
persuaded
of
man
immortality
that
though
this
poor
flesh
be
mangled
torn
asunder
burned
to
ashes
yet
the
soul
rising
beyond
the
tyrant
reach
soars
triumphant
above
death
and
this
sorry
world
to
the
refuge
of
the
everlasting
arms
for
god
is
a
just
god
now
in
a
while
becoming
conscious
that
my
pipe
was
smoked
out
and
cold
i
reached
up
my
hand
to
my
upon
the
mantelshelf
yet
i
did
not
reach
it
down
for
even
as
my
fingers
closed
upon
it
above
the
wailing
of
the
storm
above
the
hiss
and
patter
of
driven
rain
there
rose
a
cry
charmian
so
remembering
the
voice
i
had
seemed
to
hear
calling
in
my
dream
i
sat
there
with
my
hand
stretched
up
to
my
and
my
face
screwed
round
to
the
casement
behind
me
that
as
i
watched
shook
and
rattled
beneath
each
as
if
some
hand
strove
to
pluck
it
open
how
long
i
remained
thus
with
my
hand
stretched
up
to
my
and
my
eyes
upon
this
window
i
am
unable
to
say
but
all
at
once
the
door
of
the
cottage
burst
open
with
a
crash
and
immediately
the
quiet
room
was
full
of
rioting
wind
and
tempest
such
a
wind
as
stopped
my
breath
and
sent
up
a
swirl
of
smoke
and
sparks
from
the
fire
and
borne
upon
this
wind
like
some
spirit
of
the
storm
was
a
woman
with
flying
draperies
and
long
streaming
hair
who
turned
and
with
knee
and
shoulder
forced
to
the
door
and
so
leaned
there
panting
tall
she
was
and
nobly
shaped
for
her
wet
gown
clung
disclosing
the
sinuous
lines
of
her
waist
and
the
bold
full
curves
of
hip
and
thigh
her
dress
too
had
been
wrenched
and
torn
at
the
neck
and
through
the
shadow
of
her
fallen
hair
i
caught
the
ivory
gleam
of
her
shoulder
and
the
heave
and
tumult
of
her
bosom
here
i
reached
down
my
and
mechanically
began
to
fill
my
pipe
watching
her
the
while
suddenly
she
started
and
seemed
to
listen
then
with
a
swift
stealthy
movement
she
slipped
from
before
the
door
and
i
noticed
that
she
hid
one
hand
behind
her
charmian
the
woman
crouched
back
against
the
wall
with
her
eyes
towards
the
door
and
always
her
right
hand
was
hidden
in
the
folds
of
her
petticoat
so
we
remained
she
watching
the
door
and
i
her
charmian
the
voice
was
very
near
now
and
almost
immediately
after
there
came
a
loud
view
hallo
and
a
heavy
fist
pounded
upon
the
door
oh
charmian
you
there
yes
yes
inside
i
know
you
are
i
swore
you
should
never
escape
me
and
you
by
god
a
hand
fumbled
upon
the
latch
the
door
swung
open
and
a
man
entered
as
he
did
so
i
leapt
forward
and
caught
the
woman
wrist
there
was
a
blinding
flash
a
loud
report
and
a
bullet
buried
itself
somewhere
in
the
rafters
overhead
with
a
strange
repressed
cry
she
turned
upon
me
so
fiercely
that
i
fell
back
before
her
the
newcomer
meantime
had
closed
the
door
latching
it
very
carefully
and
now
standing
before
it
folded
his
arms
staring
at
her
with
bent
head
he
was
a
very
tall
man
with
a
hat
crushed
low
upon
his
brows
and
wrapped
in
a
long
overcoat
the
skirts
of
which
were
woefully
mired
and
torn
all
at
once
he
laughed
very
softly
and
musically
so
you
would
have
killed
me
would
you
charmian
shot
me
like
a
dog
his
tone
was
soft
as
his
laugh
and
equally
musical
and
yet
neither
was
good
to
hear
so
you
thought
you
had
lost
me
did
you
when
you
gave
me
the
slip
a
while
ago
lose
me
escape
me
why
i
tell
you
i
would
search
for
you
day
and
night
hunt
the
world
over
until
i
found
you
charmian
until
i
found
you
said
he
nodding
his
head
and
speaking
almost
in
a
whisper
i
would
by
god
the
woman
neither
moved
nor
uttered
a
word
only
her
breath
came
thick
and
fast
and
her
eyes
gleamed
in
the
shadow
of
her
hair
they
stood
facing
each
other
like
two
adversaries
each
measuring
the
other
strength
without
appearing
to
be
conscious
of
my
presence
indeed
the
man
had
not
so
much
as
looked
toward
me
even
when
i
had
struck
up
the
pistol
now
with
every
minute
i
was
becoming
more
curious
to
see
this
face
hidden
as
it
was
in
the
shadow
of
his
dripping
hat
brim
yet
the
fire
had
burned
low
you
always
were
a
spitfire
were
you
charmian
he
went
on
in
the
same
gentle
voice
hot
and
fierce
and
proud
the
flame
beneath
the
ice
i
knew
that
and
loved
you
the
better
for
it
and
so
i
determined
to
win
you
charmian
to
win
you
whether
you
would
or
no
and
you
are
so
strong
so
tall
and
glorious
and
strong
charmian
his
voice
had
sunk
to
a
murmur
again
and
he
drew
a
slow
step
nearer
to
her
how
wonderful
you
are
charmian
i
always
loved
your
shoulders
and
that
round
white
throat
loved
worshipped
them
worshipped
them
and
he
paused
and
i
felt
rather
than
saw
that
he
was
smiling
and
you
would
have
killed
me
charmian
shot
me
like
a
dog
but
i
would
not
have
it
different
you
have
flouted
coquetted
scorned
and
mocked
me
for
three
years
charmian
and
you
would
have
killed
me
and
i
would
not
have
it
otherwise
for
surely
you
can
see
that
this
of
itself
must
make
your
final
surrender
even
sweeter
with
a
gesture
utterly
at
variance
with
his
voice
so
sudden
fierce
and
passionate
was
it
he
sprang
toward
her
with
outstretched
arms
but
quick
as
he
she
eluded
him
and
before
he
could
reach
her
i
stepped
between
them
sir
said
i
a
word
with
you
out
of
my
way
bumpkin
he
retorted
and
brushing
one
aside
made
after
her
i
caught
him
by
the
skirts
of
his
long
loose
coat
but
with
a
dexterous
twist
he
had
left
it
in
my
grasp
yet
the
check
momentary
though
it
was
enabled
her
to
slip
through
the
door
of
that
room
which
had
once
been
donald
and
before
he
could
reach
it
i
stood
upon
the
threshold
he
regarded
me
for
a
moment
beneath
his
hat
brim
and
seemed
undecided
how
to
act
my
good
fellow
said
he
at
last
i
will
buy
your
cottage
of
you
for
name
your
price
i
shook
my
head
hereupon
he
drew
a
thick
purse
from
his
pocket
and
tossed
it
chinking
to
my
feet
there
are
two
hundred
guineas
bumpkin
maybe
more
pick
them
up
and
go
and
turning
he
flung
open
the
door
obediently
i
stooped
and
taking
up
the
purse
rolled
it
in
the
coat
which
i
still
held
and
tossed
both
out
of
the
cottage
sir
said
i
be
so
very
obliging
as
to
follow
your
property
ah
he
murmured
very
pretty
on
my
soul
and
in
that
same
moment
his
knuckles
caught
me
fairly
between
the
eyes
and
he
was
upon
me
swift
and
fierce
and
lithe
as
a
panther
i
remember
the
glint
of
his
eyes
and
the
flash
of
his
bared
teeth
now
to
one
side
of
me
now
to
the
other
as
we
swayed
to
and
fro
overturning
the
chairs
and
crashing
into
unseen
obstacles
in
that
dim
and
narrow
place
small
chance
was
there
for
feint
or
parry
it
was
blind
brutal
work
fierce
and
grim
and
silent
once
he
staggered
and
fell
heavily
carrying
the
table
crashing
with
him
and
i
saw
him
wipe
blood
from
his
face
as
he
rose
and
once
i
was
beaten
to
my
knees
but
was
up
before
he
could
reach
me
again
though
the
fire
upon
the
hearth
spun
giddily
round
and
round
and
the
floor
heaved
oddly
beneath
my
feet
then
suddenly
hands
were
upon
my
throat
and
i
could
feel
the
hot
pant
of
his
breath
in
my
face
breath
that
hissed
and
whistled
between
clenched
teeth
desperately
i
strove
to
break
his
hold
to
tear
his
hands
asunder
and
could
not
only
the
fingers
tightened
and
tightened
up
and
down
the
room
we
staggered
grim
and
voiceless
out
through
the
open
door
out
into
the
whirling
blackness
of
the
storm
and
there
amid
the
tempest
lashed
by
driving
rain
and
deafened
by
the
roaring
rush
of
wind
we
fought
as
our
savage
forefathers
may
have
done
breast
to
breast
and
knee
to
knee
stubborn
and
wild
and
merciless
the
old
old
struggle
for
supremacy
and
life
i
beat
him
with
my
fists
but
his
head
was
down
between
his
arms
i
tore
at
his
wrists
but
he
gripped
my
throat
the
tighter
and
now
we
were
down
rolling
upon
the
sodden
grass
and
now
we
were
up
stumbling
and
slipping
but
ever
the
gripping
fingers
sank
the
deeper
choking
the
strength
and
life
out
of
me
my
eyes
stared
up
into
a
heaven
streaked
with
blood
and
fire
there
was
the
taste
of
sulphur
in
my
mouth
my
arms
grew
weak
and
nerveless
and
the
roar
of
wind
seemed
a
thousand
times
more
loud
then
something
clutched
and
dragged
us
by
the
feet
we
tottered
swayed
helplessly
and
plunged
down
together
but
as
we
fell
the
deadly
gripping
fingers
slackened
for
a
moment
and
in
that
moment
i
had
broken
free
and
rolling
clear
stumbled
up
to
my
feet
yet
even
then
i
was
sill
encumbered
and
stooping
down
found
the
skirts
of
the
overcoat
twisted
tightly
about
my
foot
and
ankle
now
as
i
loosed
it
i
inwardly
blessed
that
tattered
garment
for
it
seemed
that
to
it
i
owed
my
life
so
i
stood
panting
and
waited
for
the
end
i
remember
a
blind
groping
in
the
dark
a
wild
of
random
blows
a
sudden
sharp
pain
in
my
right
hand
a
groan
and
i
was
standing
with
the
swish
of
the
rain
about
me
and
the
moaning
of
the
wind
in
the
woods
beyond
how
long
i
remained
thus
i
can
not
tell
for
i
was
as
one
in
a
dream
but
the
cool
rain
upon
my
face
refreshed
me
and
the
strong
clean
wind
in
my
nostrils
was
wonderfully
grateful
presently
raising
my
arm
stiffly
i
brushed
the
wet
hair
from
my
eyes
and
stared
round
me
into
the
pitchy
darkness
in
quest
of
my
opponent
where
are
you
said
i
at
last
and
this
was
the
first
word
uttered
during
the
struggle
where
are
you
receiving
no
answer
i
advanced
cautiously
for
it
was
as
i
have
said
black
dark
and
so
presently
touched
something
yielding
with
my
foot
come
get
up
said
i
stooping
to
lay
a
hand
upon
him
get
up
i
say
but
he
never
moved
he
was
lying
upon
his
face
and
as
i
raised
his
head
my
fingers
encountered
a
smooth
round
stone
buried
in
the
grass
and
the
touch
of
that
stone
thrilled
me
from
head
to
foot
with
sudden
dread
hastily
i
tore
open
waistcoat
and
shirt
and
pressed
nay
hand
above
his
heart
in
that
one
moment
i
lived
an
age
of
harrowing
suspense
then
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
and
rising
took
him
beneath
the
arms
and
began
to
half
drag
half
carry
him
towards
the
cottage
i
had
proceeded
thus
but
some
dozen
yards
or
so
when
during
a
momentary
lull
in
the
storm
i
thought
i
heard
a
faint
hallo
and
looking
about
saw
a
twinkling
light
that
hovered
to
and
fro
coming
and
going
yet
growing
brighter
each
moment
setting
down
my
burden
therefore
i
hollowed
my
hands
about
my
mouth
and
shouted
this
way
i
called
this
way
be
that
you
sir
cried
a
man
voice
at
no
great
distance
this
way
i
called
again
this
way
the
words
seemed
to
reassure
the
fellow
for
the
light
advanced
once
more
and
as
he
came
up
i
made
him
out
to
be
a
postilion
by
his
dress
and
the
light
he
carried
was
the
lanthorn
of
a
chaise
why
sir
he
began
looking
me
up
and
down
by
the
light
of
his
lanthorn
strike
me
lucky
if
i
ha
knowed
ye
you
looks
as
if
oh
lord
what
is
it
said
i
wiping
the
rain
from
my
eyes
again
the
postilion
answer
was
to
lower
his
lanthorn
towards
the
face
of
him
who
lay
on
the
ground
between
us
and
point
now
looking
where
he
pointed
i
started
suddenly
backwards
and
shivered
with
a
strange
stirring
of
the
flesh
for
i
saw
a
pale
face
with
a
streak
of
blood
upon
the
cheek
there
was
blood
upon
my
own
a
face
framed
in
lank
hair
thick
and
black
as
was
my
own
a
pale
aquiline
face
with
a
prominent
nose
and
long
cleft
chin
even
as
my
own
so
as
i
stood
looking
down
upon
this
face
my
breath
caught
and
my
flesh
crept
for
indeed
i
might
have
been
looking
into
a
mirror
the
face
was
the
face
of
myself
chapter
ii
the
postilion
good
lord
exclaimed
the
postilion
and
fell
back
a
step
well
said
i
meeting
his
astonished
look
as
carelessly
as
i
might
lord
love
me
said
the
postilion
what
now
i
inquired
i
never
see
such
a
thing
as
this
said
he
alternately
glancing
from
me
down
to
the
outstretched
figure
at
my
feet
if
bewitchments
or
only
enchantments
i
do
like
it
strike
me
pink
if
i
do
what
do
you
mean
eyes
continued
the
postilion
slowly
and
heavily
and
with
his
glance
wandering
still
eyes
same
nose
identical
mouth
when
not
bloody
same
hair
same
figure
same
no
i
do
like
it
it
tha
what
it
is
come
come
i
broke
in
somewhat
testily
do
stand
there
staring
like
a
fool
you
see
this
gentleman
is
hurt
the
word
went
on
the
postilion
more
as
though
speaking
his
thoughts
aloud
than
addressing
me
it
a
night
to
begin
with
seed
a
many
bad
uns
in
my
time
but
nothing
to
ekal
this
that
i
lost
my
way
are
to
be
wondered
at
then
him
and
her
out
o
the
chaise
and
off
into
the
thick
o
the
storm
that
in
the
second
place
and
then
his
face
and
your
face
that
the
most
part
of
it
all
likewise
i
never
see
one
man
in
two
suits
o
clothes
afore
nor
yet
up
and
down
both
at
the
same
minute
the
word
and
i
stop
said
i
as
he
began
to
move
away
not
on
no
account
then
i
must
make
you
said
i
and
doubled
my
fists
the
postilion
eyed
me
over
from
head
to
foot
and
paused
irresolute
what
might
you
be
wanting
with
a
peaceable
cove
like
me
he
inquired
where
is
your
chaise
up
in
the
lane
over
yonder
answered
he
with
a
vague
jerk
of
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
then
if
you
will
take
this
gentleman
heels
we
can
carry
him
well
enough
between
us
it
no
great
distance
easy
said
the
postilion
backing
away
again
easy
now
what
might
be
the
matter
with
him
if
i
might
make
so
bold
ai
dead
is
he
dead
no
fool
i
rejoined
angrily
voice
like
his
too
muttered
the
postilion
backing
away
still
farther
yes
the
word
strike
me
dumb
if
it
ai
come
will
you
do
as
i
ask
or
must
i
make
you
why
i
ai
got
no
objection
to
taking
the
gent
if
all
you
ask
though
mind
ye
if
ever
i
see
such
damned
as
this
in
all
my
days
why
drownd
me
so
after
some
delay
i
found
the
overcoat
and
purse
which
latter
i
thrust
into
the
pocket
ere
wrapping
the
garment
about
him
and
lifting
my
still
unconscious
antagonist
between
us
we
started
for
the
lane
which
we
eventually
reached
with
no
little
labor
and
difficulty
here
more
by
good
fortune
than
anything
else
we
presently
stumbled
upon
a
chaise
and
horses
drawn
up
in
the
gloom
of
sheltering
trees
in
which
we
deposited
our
limp
burden
as
comfortably
as
might
be
and
where
i
made
some
shift
to
tie
up
the
gash
in
his
brow
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
said
the
postilion
moodily
as
i
at
length
closed
the
chaise
door
it
would
be
a
nice
thing
if
was
to
go
by
the
looks
of
him
said
i
he
will
be
swearing
your
head
off
in
the
next
ten
minutes
or
so
without
another
word
the
postilion
set
the
lanthorn
back
in
its
socket
and
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
your
best
course
would
be
to
make
for
tonbridge
bearing
to
the
right
when
you
strike
the
high
road
the
postilion
nodded
and
gathering
up
the
reins
turned
to
stare
at
me
once
more
while
i
stood
in
the
gleam
of
the
lanthorn
well
i
inquired
eyes
said
he
rubbing
his
chin
very
hard
as
one
at
a
loss
eyes
nose
same
mouth
when
not
bloody
same
same
everything
same
lord
love
me
pembry
would
be
nearer
said
i
and
the
sooner
he
is
between
the
sheets
the
better
ah
exclaimed
the
postilion
with
a
slow
nod
and
drawing
out
the
word
unduly
and
talking
o
sheets
and
beds
what
about
my
second
passenger
i
started
wi
two
and
only
one
what
about
number
two
what
about
her
i
repeated
as
was
with
number
one
what
was
wi
number
one
all
the
way
from
london
as
run
away
from
number
one
into
the
wood
yonder
what
about
number
two
why
to
be
sure
i
had
forgotten
her
forgotten
repeated
the
postilion
oh
lord
yes
and
leaning
over
he
winked
one
eye
very
deliberately
forgotten
ah
to
be
sure
of
course
and
he
winked
again
what
do
you
mean
i
demanded
nettled
by
the
fellow
manner
mean
said
he
i
means
as
of
all
the
damned
as
come
on
a
honest
cove
why
i
that
there
cove
so
me
saying
which
he
cracked
his
whip
the
horses
plunged
forward
and
almost
immediately
as
it
seemed
horses
chaise
and
postilion
had
lurched
into
the
black
murk
of
the
night
and
vanished
chapter
iii
which
bears
ample
testimony
to
the
strength
of
the
gentleman
fists
considering
all
that
had
befallen
during
the
last
or
so
it
was
not
very
surprising
i
think
that
i
should
have
forgotten
the
very
existence
of
this
woman
charmian
even
though
she
had
been
chiefly
instrumental
in
bringing
it
all
about
and
to
have
her
recalled
to
my
recollection
thus
suddenly
and
moreover
the
possibility
that
i
must
meet
with
and
talk
to
her
perturbed
me
greatly
and
i
remained
for
some
time
quite
oblivious
to
wind
and
rain
all
engrossed
by
the
thought
of
this
woman
a
dark
fierce
amazonian
creature
i
told
myself
who
had
abhorrent
thought
already
attempted
one
man
life
furthermore
a
tall
woman
and
strong
therefore
unmaidenly
with
eyes
that
gleamed
wild
in
the
shadow
of
her
hair
and
yet
my
dismay
arose
not
so
much
from
any
of
these
as
from
the
fact
that
she
was
a
woman
and
consequently
beyond
my
ken
hitherto
i
had
regarded
the
sex
very
much
from
a
distance
and
a
little
askance
as
creatures
naturally
illogical
and
given
to
unreasoning
impulse
delicate
ethereal
beings
whose
lives
were
made
up
of
petty
trifles
and
vanities
who
were
sent
into
this
gross
world
to
be
admired
petted
occasionally
worshipped
and
frequently
married
indeed
my
education
in
this
direction
had
been
shockingly
neglected
thus
far
not
so
much
from
lack
of
inclination
for
who
can
deny
the
fascination
of
the
sex
as
for
lack
of
time
and
opportunity
for
when
as
a
young
gentleman
of
means
and
great
expectations
i
should
have
been
writing
sonnets
to
the
eyebrow
of
some
ladye
fayre
or
surreptitiously
wooing
some
farmer
daughter
in
common
with
my
kind
i
was
hearkening
to
the
plaint
of
some
greek
or
roman
lover
or
chuckling
over
old
brantome
thus
women
were
to
me
practically
an
unknown
quantity
as
yet
and
hence
it
was
with
no
little
trepidation
that
i
now
started
out
for
the
cottage
and
this
truly
amazonian
charmian
unless
she
had
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
she
had
come
which
i
found
myself
devoutly
hoping
as
i
went
i
became
conscious
that
i
was
bleeding
copiously
above
the
brow
that
my
throat
was
much
swollen
and
that
the
thumb
of
my
right
hand
pained
exceedingly
at
the
least
touch
added
to
which
was
a
dizziness
of
the
head
and
a
general
soreness
of
body
that
testified
to
the
strength
of
my
opponent
fists
on
i
stumbled
my
head
bent
low
against
the
stinging
rain
and
with
uncertain
clumsy
feet
for
reaction
had
come
and
with
it
a
deadly
faintness
twigs
swung
out
of
the
darkness
to
lash
at
and
catch
me
as
i
passed
invisible
trees
creaked
and
groaned
above
and
around
me
and
once
as
i
paused
to
make
more
certain
of
my
direction
a
dim
vague
mass
plunged
down
athwart
my
path
with
a
rending
crash
on
i
went
wearily
enough
and
with
the
faintness
growing
upon
me
a
sickness
that
would
not
be
fought
down
guiding
my
course
by
touch
rather
than
sight
until
finding
myself
at
fault
i
stopped
again
staring
about
me
beneath
my
hand
yet
feeling
the
faintness
increase
with
inaction
i
started
forward
groping
before
me
as
i
went
i
had
gone
but
a
few
paces
however
when
i
tripped
over
some
obstacle
and
fell
heavily
it
wanted
but
this
to
complete
my
misery
and
i
lay
where
i
was
overcome
by
a
deadly
nausea
now
presently
as
i
lay
thus
spent
and
sick
i
became
aware
of
a
soft
glow
a
brightness
that
seemingly
played
all
around
me
wherefore
lifting
my
heavy
head
i
beheld
a
ray
of
light
that
pierced
the
gloom
a
long
gleaming
vista
jewelled
by
falling
raindrops
whose
brilliance
was
blurred
now
and
then
by
the
flitting
shapes
of
branches
at
sight
of
this
my
strength
revived
and
rising
i
staggered
on
towards
this
welcome
light
and
thus
i
saw
that
it
streamed
from
the
window
of
my
cottage
even
then
it
seemed
i
journeyed
miles
before
i
felt
the
latch
beneath
my
fingers
and
fumbling
opened
the
door
stumbled
in
and
closed
it
after
me
for
a
space
i
stood
dazed
by
the
sudden
light
and
then
little
by
little
noticed
that
the
table
and
chairs
had
been
righted
that
the
fire
had
been
mended
and
that
candles
burned
brightly
upon
the
mantel
all
this
i
saw
but
dimly
for
there
was
a
mist
before
my
eyes
yet
i
was
conscious
that
the
girl
had
leapt
up
on
my
entrance
and
now
stood
fronting
me
across
the
table
you
said
she
in
a
low
repressed
voice
you
now
as
she
spoke
i
saw
the
glitter
of
steel
in
her
hand
keep
back
she
said
in
the
same
subdued
tone
keep
back
i
warn
you
but
i
only
leaned
there
against
the
door
even
as
she
had
done
indeed
i
doubt
if
i
could
have
moved
just
then
had
i
tried
and
as
i
stood
thus
hanging
my
head
and
not
answering
her
she
stamped
her
foot
suddenly
and
laughed
a
short
fierce
laugh
so
he
has
hurt
you
she
cried
you
are
all
blood
it
is
running
down
your
face
the
country
bumpkin
has
hurt
you
oh
i
am
glad
glad
glad
and
she
laughed
again
i
might
have
run
away
she
went
on
mockingly
but
you
see
i
was
prepared
for
you
and
she
held
up
the
knife
prepared
for
you
and
now
you
are
pale
and
hurt
and
faint
yes
you
are
faint
the
country
bumpkin
has
done
his
work
well
i
shall
not
need
this
after
all
see
and
she
flung
the
knife
upon
the
table
yes
it
is
better
there
said
i
and
i
think
madam
is
mistaken
mistaken
she
cried
with
a
sudden
catch
in
her
voice
what
what
do
you
mean
that
i
am
the
bumpkin
said
i
now
as
i
spoke
a
black
mist
enveloped
all
things
my
knees
loosened
suddenly
and
stumbling
forward
i
sank
into
a
chair
i
am
very
tired
i
sighed
and
so
as
it
seemed
fell
asleep
chapter
iv
which
among
other
matters
has
to
do
with
bruises
and
bandages
she
was
on
her
knees
beside
me
bathing
my
battered
face
talking
all
the
while
in
a
soft
voice
that
i
thought
wonderfully
sweet
to
hear
poor
boy
she
was
saying
over
and
over
again
poor
boy
and
after
she
had
said
it
perhaps
a
dozen
times
i
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
at
her
madam
i
am
said
hereupon
sponge
in
hand
she
drew
back
and
looked
at
me
a
wonderful
face
the
eyes
were
dark
and
swiftly
changeful
and
there
was
a
subtle
witchery
in
the
slanting
shadow
of
their
lashes
she
repeated
can
it
really
be
why
not
madam
so
very
young
why
i
began
greatly
taken
aback
indeed
i
that
is
but
here
she
laughed
and
then
she
sighed
and
sighing
shook
her
head
poor
boy
said
she
poor
boy
and
when
i
would
have
retorted
she
stopped
me
with
the
sponge
your
mouth
is
cut
said
she
after
a
while
and
there
is
a
great
gash
in
your
brow
but
the
water
feels
delicious
said
i
and
your
throat
is
all
scratched
and
swollen
but
your
hands
are
very
gentle
and
soothing
i
do
hurt
you
then
on
the
contrary
the
the
pain
is
very
trifling
thank
you
yet
you
fainted
a
little
while
ago
then
it
was
very
foolish
of
me
poor
she
hesitated
and
looking
up
at
her
through
the
trickling
water
i
saw
that
she
was
fellow
said
she
and
her
lips
were
very
sweet
and
her
eyes
very
soft
and
tender
for
an
amazon
and
when
she
had
washed
the
blood
from
my
face
she
went
to
fetch
clean
water
from
where
i
kept
it
in
a
bucket
in
the
corner
now
at
my
elbow
upon
the
table
lay
the
knife
a
heavy
clumsy
contrivance
i
had
bought
to
use
in
my
carpentry
and
i
now
mechanically
picked
it
up
as
i
did
so
the
light
gleamed
evilly
upon
its
long
blade
put
it
down
she
commanded
put
it
away
it
is
a
hateful
thing
for
a
woman
hand
i
added
so
hideously
unfeminine
some
men
are
so
hatefully
hideously
masculine
she
retorted
her
lip
curling
i
expected
him
and
you
are
terribly
like
him
as
to
that
said
i
i
may
have
the
same
colored
eyes
and
hair
and
be
something
of
the
same
build
yes
she
nodded
it
was
your
build
and
the
color
of
your
eyes
and
hair
that
startled
me
but
after
all
said
i
the
similarity
is
only
and
goes
no
farther
no
she
answered
kneeling
beside
me
again
no
you
are
only
and
as
she
said
this
her
eyes
were
hidden
by
her
lashes
is
said
i
more
sharply
than
before
why
do
you
smile
the
water
is
all
dripping
from
your
nose
and
chin
stoop
lower
over
the
basin
and
yet
said
i
as
well
as
i
could
on
account
of
the
trickling
water
for
she
was
bathing
my
face
again
and
yet
you
must
be
years
younger
than
i
but
then
some
women
always
feel
older
than
a
man
more
especially
if
he
is
hurt
thank
you
said
i
thank
you
with
the
exception
of
a
scratch
or
so
i
am
very
well
but
as
i
moved
i
caught
my
thumb
clumsily
against
the
and
winced
with
the
sudden
pain
of
it
what
is
it
your
hand
my
thumb
let
me
see
obediently
i
stretched
out
my
hand
to
her
is
it
broken
dislocated
i
think
it
is
greatly
swollen
yes
said
i
and
taking
firm
hold
of
it
with
my
left
hand
i
gave
it
a
sudden
pull
which
started
the
sweat
upon
my
temples
but
sent
it
back
into
joint
poor
well
said
i
as
she
man
said
she
and
touched
the
swollen
hand
very
tenderly
with
her
fingers
you
do
not
fear
me
any
longer
no
in
spite
of
my
eyes
and
hair
in
spite
of
your
eyes
and
hair
you
see
a
woman
knows
instinctively
whom
she
must
fear
and
whom
not
to
fear
well
and
you
are
one
i
do
not
fear
and
i
think
never
should
hum
said
i
rubbing
my
chin
i
am
only
is
said
she
demurely
and
yet
i
am
very
like
him
you
said
so
yourself
him
she
exclaimed
starting
i
had
forgotten
all
about
him
where
is
he
what
has
become
of
him
and
she
glanced
apprehensively
towards
the
door
half
way
to
tonbridge
or
should
be
by
now
tonbridge
said
she
in
a
tone
of
amazement
and
turned
to
look
at
me
again
tonbridge
i
repeated
but
he
is
not
the
man
to
to
run
away
said
she
doubtfully
even
from
you
no
indeed
said
i
shaking
my
head
he
certainly
did
not
run
away
but
circumstances
and
a
stone
were
too
much
even
for
him
a
stone
upon
which
he
happened
to
fall
and
strike
his
head
very
fortunately
for
me
was
he
much
hurt
stunned
only
i
answered
she
was
still
kneeling
beside
my
chair
but
now
she
sat
back
and
turned
to
stare
into
the
fire
and
as
she
sat
i
noticed
how
full
and
round
and
white
her
arms
were
for
her
sleeves
were
rolled
high
and
that
the
hand
which
yet
held
the
sponge
was
likewise
very
white
neither
big
nor
little
a
trifle
wide
perhaps
but
with
long
slender
fingers
presently
with
a
sudden
gesture
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
me
again
a
long
searching
look
who
are
you
she
asked
suddenly
my
name
said
i
is
peter
yes
she
nodded
with
her
eyes
still
on
mine
peter
smith
i
went
on
and
by
that
same
token
i
am
a
blacksmith
very
humbly
at
your
service
peter
smith
she
repeated
as
though
trying
the
sound
of
it
hesitating
at
the
surname
exactly
as
i
had
done
peter
smith
and
mine
is
charmian
charmian
brown
and
here
again
was
a
pause
between
the
two
names
yours
is
a
very
beautiful
name
said
i
especially
the
charmian
and
yours
she
retorted
is
a
beautifully
ugly
one
yes
especially
the
peter
indeed
i
quite
agree
with
you
said
i
rising
and
now
if
i
may
trouble
you
for
the
towel
thank
you
forthwith
i
began
to
dry
my
face
as
well
as
i
might
on
account
of
my
injured
thumb
while
she
watched
me
with
a
certain
elusive
merriment
peeping
from
her
eyes
and
quivering
at
me
round
her
lips
an
expression
half
mocking
half
amused
that
i
had
seen
there
more
than
once
already
wherefore
to
hide
from
her
my
consciousness
of
this
i
fell
to
towelling
myself
vigorously
so
much
so
that
forgetting
the
cut
in
my
brow
i
set
it
bleeding
faster
than
ever
oh
you
are
very
clumsy
she
cried
springing
up
and
snatching
the
towel
from
me
she
began
to
stanch
the
blood
with
it
if
you
will
sit
down
i
will
bind
it
up
for
you
really
it
is
quite
unnecessary
i
demurred
quite
said
she
is
there
anything
will
serve
as
a
bandage
there
is
the
towel
i
suggested
not
to
be
thought
of
then
you
might
tear
a
strip
off
the
sheet
said
i
nodding
towards
the
bed
ridiculous
said
she
and
proceeded
to
draw
a
handkerchief
from
the
bosom
of
her
dress
and
having
folded
it
with
great
nicety
and
moistened
it
in
the
bowl
she
tied
it
about
my
temples
now
to
do
this
she
had
perforce
to
pass
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
this
brought
her
so
near
that
i
could
feel
her
breath
upon
my
lips
and
there
stole
to
me
out
of
her
hair
or
out
of
her
bosom
a
perfume
very
sweet
that
was
like
the
fragrance
of
violets
at
evening
but
her
hands
were
all
too
dexterous
and
quicker
than
it
takes
to
write
the
bandage
was
tied
and
she
was
standing
before
me
straight
and
tall
there
that
is
more
comfortable
is
it
she
inquired
and
with
the
words
she
bestowed
a
final
little
pat
to
the
bandage
a
touch
so
light
so
ineffably
gentle
that
it
might
almost
have
been
the
hand
of
that
mother
whom
i
had
never
known
that
is
better
it
she
demanded
thank
you
yes
very
comfortable
said
i
but
as
the
word
left
me
my
glance
by
accident
encountered
the
pistol
near
by
and
at
sight
of
it
a
sudden
anger
came
upon
me
for
i
remembered
that
but
for
my
intervention
this
girl
was
a
murderess
wherefore
i
would
fain
have
destroyed
the
vile
thing
and
reached
for
it
impulsively
but
she
was
before
me
and
snatching
up
the
weapon
hid
it
behind
her
as
she
had
done
once
before
give
it
to
me
said
i
frowning
it
is
an
accursed
thing
yet
it
has
been
my
friend
she
answered
give
it
to
me
i
repeated
she
threw
up
her
head
and
regarded
me
with
a
disdainful
air
for
my
tone
had
been
imperative
come
said
i
and
held
out
my
hand
so
for
a
while
we
looked
into
each
other
eyes
then
all
at
once
she
dropped
the
weapon
on
the
table
before
me
and
turned
her
back
to
me
i
think
she
began
speaking
with
her
back
still
turned
to
me
well
said
that
you
have
yes
said
very
unpleasant
eyes
i
am
very
sorry
for
that
said
i
dropping
the
weapon
out
of
sight
behind
my
row
of
books
having
done
which
i
drew
both
chairs
nearer
the
fire
and
invited
her
to
sit
down
thank
you
i
prefer
to
stand
said
she
loftily
as
you
will
i
answered
but
even
while
i
spoke
she
seemed
to
change
her
mind
for
she
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
and
chin
in
hand
stared
into
the
fire
and
so
said
she
as
i
sat
down
opposite
her
and
so
your
name
is
peter
smith
and
you
are
a
blacksmith
yes
a
blacksmith
and
make
horseshoes
naturally
yes
and
do
you
live
here
yes
alone
quite
alone
and
how
long
have
you
lived
here
alone
not
so
long
that
i
am
tired
of
it
and
is
this
cottage
yours
yes
that
is
it
stands
on
the
sefton
estates
i
believe
but
nobody
hereabouts
would
seem
anxious
to
dispute
my
right
of
occupying
the
place
why
not
because
it
is
generally
supposed
to
be
haunted
oh
it
was
built
by
some
wanderer
of
the
roads
i
explained
a
stranger
to
these
parts
who
lived
alone
here
and
eventually
died
alone
here
died
here
hanged
himself
on
the
staple
above
the
door
yonder
oh
said
she
again
and
cast
a
fearful
glance
towards
the
rusty
staple
the
country
folk
believe
his
spirit
still
haunts
the
place
i
went
on
and
seldom
or
never
venture
foot
within
the
hollow
and
are
you
not
afraid
of
this
ghost
no
said
i
it
must
be
very
lonely
here
delightfully
so
are
you
so
fond
of
solitude
yes
for
solitude
is
thought
and
to
think
is
to
live
and
what
did
you
do
with
the
pistol
i
dropped
it
out
of
sight
behind
my
books
yonder
i
wonder
why
i
gave
it
to
you
because
if
you
remember
i
asked
you
for
it
but
i
usually
dislike
doing
what
i
am
asked
and
your
manner
was
scarcely
courteous
you
also
objected
to
my
eyes
i
think
yes
she
nodded
hum
said
i
the
dark
night
outside
was
filled
with
malignant
demons
now
who
tore
at
the
rattling
casements
who
roared
and
bellowed
down
the
chimney
or
screamed
furiously
round
the
cottage
but
here
in
the
warm
firelight
i
heeded
them
not
at
all
watching
rather
this
woman
where
she
sat
leaned
forward
gazing
deep
into
the
glow
and
where
the
light
touched
her
hair
it
woke
strange
fires
red
and
bronze
and
it
was
very
rebellious
hair
with
little
tendrils
that
gleamed
here
and
there
against
her
temples
and
small
defiant
curls
that
seemed
to
strive
to
hide
behind
her
ear
or
bold
and
wanton
to
kiss
her
snowy
neck
out
of
sheer
bravado
as
to
her
dress
i
little
by
little
became
aware
of
two
facts
for
whereas
her
gown
was
of
a
rough
coarse
material
such
as
domestic
servants
wear
the
stockinged
foot
that
peeped
at
me
beneath
its
hem
her
shoes
were
drying
on
the
hearth
was
clad
in
a
silk
so
fine
that
i
could
catch
through
it
the
gleam
of
the
white
flesh
beneath
from
this
apparent
inconsistency
i
deduced
that
she
was
of
educated
tastes
but
poor
probably
a
governess
or
more
likely
still
taking
her
hands
into
consideration
with
their
long
prehensile
fingers
a
teacher
of
music
and
was
going
on
to
explain
to
myself
her
present
situation
as
the
outcome
of
beauty
poverty
and
the
devil
when
she
sighed
glanced
toward
the
door
shivered
slightly
and
reaching
her
shoes
from
the
hearth
prepared
to
slip
them
on
they
are
still
very
wet
said
i
deprecatingly
yes
she
answered
listen
to
the
wind
said
i
it
is
terribly
high
and
it
rains
very
hard
said
i
yes
and
she
shivered
again
it
will
be
bad
travelling
for
any
one
said
charmian
stared
into
the
fire
indeed
it
would
be
madness
for
the
strongest
to
stir
abroad
on
such
a
night
charmian
stared
into
the
fire
what
with
the
wind
and
the
rain
the
roads
would
be
utterly
impassable
not
to
mention
the
risks
of
falling
trees
or
shattered
boughs
charmian
shivered
again
and
the
inns
are
all
shut
long
ago
to
stir
out
therefore
would
be
the
purest
folly
charmian
stared
into
the
fire
on
the
other
hand
here
are
a
warm
room
a
good
fire
and
a
very
excellent
bed
she
neither
spoke
nor
moved
only
her
eyes
were
raised
suddenly
and
swiftly
to
mine
also
i
continued
returning
her
look
here
most
convenient
to
your
hand
is
a
fine
sharp
knife
in
case
you
are
afraid
of
the
ghost
or
any
other
midnight
visitant
and
so
good
night
madam
saying
which
i
took
up
one
of
the
candles
and
crossed
to
the
door
of
that
room
which
had
once
been
donald
but
here
i
paused
to
glance
back
at
her
furthermore
said
i
snuffing
my
candle
with
great
nicety
madam
need
have
no
further
qualms
regarding
the
color
of
my
hair
and
eyes
none
whatever
whereupon
i
bowed
somewhat
stiffly
on
account
of
my
bruises
and
going
into
my
chamber
closed
the
door
behind
me
having
made
the
bed
for
since
donald
departure
i
had
occupied
my
two
beds
alternately
i
undressed
slowly
for
my
thumb
was
very
painful
also
i
paused
frequently
to
catch
the
sound
of
the
light
quick
footstep
beyond
the
door
and
the
whisper
of
her
garments
as
she
walked
charmian
said
i
to
myself
when
at
length
all
was
still
charmian
and
i
blew
out
my
candle
outside
the
souls
of
the
unnumbered
dead
still
rode
the
storm
and
the
world
was
filled
with
their
woeful
lamentation
but
as
i
lay
in
the
dark
there
came
to
me
a
faint
perfume
as
of
violets
at
elusive
and
very
sweet
breathing
of
charmian
herself
and
putting
up
my
hand
i
touched
the
handkerchief
that
bound
my
brow
charmian
said
i
to
myself
again
and
so
fell
asleep
chapter
v
in
which
i
hear
ill
news
of
george
the
sun
was
pouring
in
at
my
lattice
when
i
awoke
next
morning
to
a
general
soreness
of
body
that
at
first
puzzled
me
to
account
for
but
as
i
lay
in
that
delicious
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
i
became
aware
of
a
faint
sweet
perfume
and
turning
my
head
espied
a
handkerchief
upon
the
pillow
beside
me
and
immediately
i
came
to
my
elbow
with
my
eyes
directed
to
the
door
for
now
indeed
i
remembered
all
and
beyond
that
door
sleeping
or
waking
lay
a
woman
in
the
early
morning
things
are
apt
to
lose
something
of
the
glamour
that
was
theirs
over
night
thus
i
remained
propped
upon
my
elbow
gazing
apprehensively
at
the
door
and
with
my
ears
on
the
stretch
hearkening
for
any
movement
from
the
room
beyond
that
should
tell
me
she
was
up
but
i
heard
only
the
early
chorus
of
the
birds
and
the
gurgle
of
the
brook
swollen
with
last
night
rain
in
a
while
i
rose
and
began
to
dress
somewhat
awkwardly
on
account
of
my
thumb
yet
with
rather
more
than
my
usual
care
stopping
occasionally
to
hear
if
she
was
yet
astir
being
at
last
fully
dressed
i
sat
down
to
wait
until
i
should
hear
her
footstep
but
i
listened
vainly
for
minute
after
minute
elapsed
until
rising
at
length
i
knocked
softly
and
having
knocked
thrice
each
time
louder
than
before
without
effect
i
lifted
the
latch
and
opened
the
door
my
first
glance
showed
me
that
the
bed
had
never
even
been
slept
in
and
that
save
for
myself
the
place
was
empty
and
yet
the
had
been
neatly
set
though
with
but
one
cup
and
saucer
now
beside
this
cup
and
saucer
was
one
of
my
few
books
and
picking
it
up
i
saw
that
it
was
my
virgil
upon
the
at
which
it
was
open
i
had
years
ago
scrawled
my
name
thus
peter
vibart
but
lo
close
under
this
written
in
a
fine
italian
hand
were
the
following
words
to
peter
smith
esq
the
smith
underlined
blacksmith
charmian
brown
brown
likewise
underlined
desires
to
thank
smith
yet
because
thanks
are
so
poor
and
small
and
his
service
so
great
needs
must
she
remember
him
as
a
gentleman
yet
oftener
as
a
blacksmith
and
most
of
all
as
a
man
charmian
brown
begs
him
to
accept
this
little
trinket
in
memory
of
her
it
is
all
she
has
to
offer
him
he
may
also
keep
her
handkerchief
upon
the
table
on
the
very
spot
where
the
book
had
lain
was
a
gold
locket
very
quaint
and
upon
one
side
of
which
was
engraved
the
following
posy
hee
who
myne
heart
would
keepe
for
long
shall
be
a
gentil
man
and
strong
attached
to
the
locket
was
a
narrow
blue
riband
wherefore
passing
this
riband
over
my
head
i
hung
the
locket
about
my
neck
and
having
read
through
the
message
once
more
i
closed
the
virgil
and
replacing
it
on
the
shelf
set
about
brewing
a
cup
of
tea
and
so
presently
sat
down
to
breakfast
i
had
scarcely
done
so
however
when
there
came
a
timid
knock
at
the
door
whereat
i
rose
expectantly
and
immediately
sat
down
again
come
in
said
i
the
latch
was
slowly
raised
the
door
swung
open
and
the
ancient
appeared
if
i
was
surprised
to
see
him
at
such
an
hour
he
was
even
more
so
for
at
sight
of
me
his
mouth
opened
and
he
stood
staring
speechlessly
leaning
upon
his
stick
why
ancient
said
i

pinch

suddenly
in
the
act
of
inhaling
it
to
stare
at

very
hard

in

hopeful
tone

an
peter
the
pinch
of
snuff
fell
and
made
a
little
brown
cloud
on

snow
of

as

trembling
and

towards

and
he
laid
a
beseeching
hand
upon
mine
peter
his
voice
had
sunk
almost
to
a
whisper
and
the
hand
plucked
tremulously
at
my
sleeve
while
in
the
wrinkled
old
face
was
a
look
of
pitiful
entreaty

he
now
nobody
knows
but
theer
them
as
says
they
see
makin
for
sefton
woods
hereupon
breakfast
done
i
rose
and
took
my
hat
wheer
away
peter
to
the
forge
there
is
much
work
to
be
done
ancient
but
jarge
bea
theer
to
ye
yet
the
work
remains
ancient
why
then
if
you
goin
i
go
wi
ye
peter
so
we
presently
set
out
together
all
about
us
as
we
walked
were
mute
evidences
of
the
fury
of
last
night
storm
trees
had
been
uprooted
and
great
branches
torn
from
others
as
if
by
the
hands
of
angry
giants
and
the
brook
was
a
raging
torrent
down
here
in
the
hollow
the
destruction
had
been
less
but
in
the
woods
above
the
giants
had
worked
their
will
and
many
an
empty
gap
showed
where
erstwhile
had
stood
a
tall
and
stately
tree
trees
be
very
like
men
said
the
ancient
nodding
to
one
that
lay
prone
beside
the
path
an
gone
peter
gone
the
man
in
the
bible
as
was
cured
of
blindness
by
our
blessed
lord
said
as
men
was
like
trees
walkin
but
to
my
mind
peter
trees
is
much
more
like
men
still
ye
see
peter
trees
be
such
companionable
things
it
very
seldom
as
you
see
a
tree
growin
all
by
itself
an
when
you
do
if
you
look
at
it
you
ca
but
notice
lonely
it
do
look
ay
its
very
leaves
seem
to
a
sort
o
drop
i
knowed
three
on
once
they
was
growin
all
close
together
so
close
that
their
branches
used
to
touch
each
other
when
the
wind
blew
jest
as
if
they
was
wi
one
another
peter
you
could
see
as
they
was
uncommon
fond
of
each
other
wi
half
an
eye
well
one
day
along
comes
a
storm
and
blows
one
on
down
kills
it
dead
peter
an
a
little
while
later
they
cuts
down
another
lord
knows
why
an
theer
was
the
last
one
all
alone
an
solitary
now
i
used
to
watch
that
theer
tree
an
here
the
thing
peter
day
by
day
i
see
that
tree
an
droopin
an
for
them
other
two
brothers
you
might
say
till
one
day
i
come
by
an
theer
it
were
peter
up
so
big
an
tall
as
ever
but
dead
ay
peter
dead
it
were
an
never
put
forth
another
leaf
an
never
will
peter
never
an
if
you
was
to
ax
me
i
should
say
as
it
died
because
its
were
broke
peter
yes
trees
is
very
like
men
an
the
older
you
grow
the
more
you
see
it
i
listened
it
was
thus
we
talked
or
rather
the
ancient
talked
and
i
listened
until
we
reached
sissinghurst
at
the
door
of
the
smithy
we
stopped
peter
said
the
old
man
staring
very
hard
at
a
button
on
my
coat
well
ancient
what
about
that
theer
poor
old
rusty
stapil
why
it
is
still
above
the
door
ancient
you
must
have
seen
it
this
morning
oh
ah
i
seed
it
peter
i
seed
it
answered
the
old
man
shifting
his
gaze
to
a
rolling
white
cloud
above
i
give
it
a
glimp
over
peter
but
what
do
think
of
it
well
said
i
aware
of
the
fixity
of
his
gaze
and
the
wistful
note
in
his
voice
it
is
certainly
older
and
rustier
than
it
was
rustier
peter
much
rustier
very
slowly
a
smile
dawned
on
the
wrinkled
old
face
and
very
slowly
the
eyes
were
lowered
till
they
met
mine
eh
lad
but
i
be
glad
o
that
we
be
all
growin
older
peter
an
though
i
be
a
wonnerful
man
for
my
age
an
so
strong
as
a
peter
still
i
du
sometimes
feel
like
i
be
growin
rustier
wi
length
o
days
an
is
a
comfort
to
know
as
that
theer
rustier
along
wi
me
old
i
be
but
t
stapil
old
too
peter
an
i
be
waitin
for
the
day
when
it
shall
rust
itself
away
altogether
an
when
that
day
comes
peter
then
i
say
like
the
patriach
in
the
bible
now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
amen
peter
amen
said
i
and
so
having
watched
the
old
man
totter
across
to
the
bull
i
turned
into
the
smithy
and
set
about
lighting
the
fire
chapter
vi
in
which
i
learn
of
an
impending
danger
i
am
at
the
forge
watching
the
deepening
glow
of
the
coals
as
i
ply
the
bellows
and
listening
to
their
hoarse
not
unmusical
drone
it
seems
like
a
familiar
voice
or
the
voice
of
a
familiar
albeit
a
somewhat
wheezy
one
speaking
to
me
in
stertorous
gasps
something
in
this
wise
charmian
brown
desires
to
thank
smith
but
because
thanks
are
so
poor
and
small
and
his
service
so
great
needs
must
she
remember
him
remember
me
said
i
aloud
and
letting
go
the
shaft
of
the
bellows
the
better
to
think
this
over
it
naturally
followed
that
the
bellows
grew
suddenly
dumb
whereupon
i
seized
the
handle
and
recommenced
blowing
with
a
remember
him
as
a
gentleman
wheezed
the
familiar
psha
i
yet
oftener
as
a
smith
hum
said
and
most
of
all
as
a
man
as
a
man
said
i
and
turning
my
back
upon
the
bellows
i
sat
down
upon
the
anvil
and
taking
my
chin
in
my
hand
stared
away
to
where
the
red
roof
of
old
amos
peeped
through
the
swaying
green
of
leaves
as
a
man
said
i
to
myself
again
and
so
fell
of
this
charmian
and
in
my
mind
i
saw
her
not
as
she
had
first
appeared
tall
and
fierce
and
wild
but
as
she
had
been
when
she
stooped
to
bind
up
the
hurt
in
my
brow
with
her
deep
eyes
brimful
of
tenderness
and
her
mouth
sweet
and
compassionate
beautiful
eyes
she
had
though
whether
they
were
blue
or
brown
or
black
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
remember
only
i
knew
i
could
never
forget
the
look
they
had
held
when
she
gave
that
final
pat
to
the
bandage
and
here
i
found
that
i
was
turning
a
little
locket
round
and
round
in
my
fingers
a
little
locket
with
its
quaint
inscription
hee
who
myne
heart
would
keepe
for
long
shall
be
a
gentil
man
and
strong
i
was
sitting
thus
plunged
in
a
reverie
when
a
shadow
fell
across
the
floor
and
looking
up
i
beheld
prudence
and
straightway
slipping
the
locket
back
into
the
bosom
of
my
shirt
i
rose
to
my
feet
somewhat
shamefaced
to
be
caught
thus
idle
her
face
was
troubled
and
her
eyes
red
as
from
recent
tears
while
in
her
hand
she
held
a
crumpled
paper
peter
she
began
and
then
stopped
staring
at
me
well
prudence
you
you
seen
him
him
whom
do
you
mean
black
jarge
no
what
should
make
you
think
so
your
face
be
all
cut
you
been
fightin
and
supposing
i
have
that
is
none
of
george
doing
he
and
i
are
very
good
friends
why
should
we
quarrel
then
then
it
were
jarge
no
i
have
not
seen
him
since
saturday
thank
god
she
exclaimed
pressing
her
hand
to
her
bosom
as
if
to
stay
its
heaving
but
you
must
go
she
went
on
breathlessly
oh
peter
i
been
so
fearful
for
and
and
you
might
meet
each
other
any
time
so
so
you
must
go
away
prudence
said
i
prudence
what
do
you
mean
for
answer
she
held
out
the
crumpled
paper
and
scrawled
in
great
straggling
characters
i
read
these
words
prudence
i
going
away
i
shall
kill
him
else
but
i
shall
come
back
tell
him
not
to
cross
my
path
or
god
help
him
and
you
and
me
george
what
does
it
all
mean
prudence
said
i
like
a
fool
now
as
i
spoke
glancing
at
her
i
saw
her
cheeks
that
had
seemed
hitherto
more
pale
than
usual
grow
suddenly
scarlet
and
meeting
my
eyes
she
hid
her
face
in
her
two
hands
then
seeing
her
distress
in
that
same
instant
i
found
the
answer
to
my
question
and
so
stood
turning
poor
george
letter
over
and
over
more
like
a
fool
than
ever
you
must
go
away
you
must
go
away
she
repeated
hum
said
i
you
must
go
soon
he
means
it
i
i
seen
death
in
his
face
she
said
shuddering
go
the
longer
you
stay
here
the
worse
for
all
of
us
go
now
prudence
said
i
yes
mr
peter
from
behind
her
hands
you
always
loved
black
george
did
you
yes
mr
peter
and
you
love
him
still
do
you
a
moment
silence
then
yes
mr
peter
excellent
said
i
her
head
was
raised
a
trifle
and
one
tearful
eye
looked
at
me
over
her
fingers
i
had
always
hoped
you
did
i
continued
for
his
sake
and
for
yours
and
in
my
way
a
very
blundering
way
as
it
seems
now
i
have
tried
to
bring
you
two
together
prudence
only
sobbed
but
things
are
not
hopeless
yet
i
think
i
can
see
a
means
of
straightening
out
this
tangle
oh
if
we
only
could
sobbed
prudence
ye
see
i
were
very
cruel
to
him
mr
peter
just
a
little
perhaps
said
i
and
while
she
dabbed
at
her
pretty
eyes
with
her
snowy
apron
i
took
pen
and
ink
from
the
shelf
where
i
kept
them
which
together
with
george
letter
i
set
upon
the
anvil
now
said
i
in
answer
to
her
questioning
look
write
down
just
here
below
where
george
signed
his
name
what
you
told
me
a
moment
ago
you
mean
that
i
that
you
love
him
yes
oh
mr
peter
prudence
said
i
it
is
the
only
way
so
far
as
i
can
see
of
saving
george
from
himself
and
no
sweet
pure
maid
need
be
ashamed
to
tell
her
love
especially
to
such
a
man
as
this
who
worships
the
very
ground
that
little
shoe
of
yours
has
once
pressed
she
glanced
up
at
me
under
her
wet
lashes
as
i
said
this
and
a
soft
light
beamed
in
her
eyes
and
a
smile
hovered
upon
her
red
lips
do
he
really
mr
peter
indeed
he
does
prudence
though
i
think
you
must
know
that
without
my
telling
you
so
she
stooped
above
the
anvil
blushing
a
little
and
sighing
a
little
and
crying
a
little
and
with
fingers
that
trembled
somewhat
to
be
sure
wrote
these
four
words
george
i
love
you
what
now
mr
peter
she
inquired
seeing
me
begin
to
unbuckle
my
leather
apron
now
i
answered
i
am
going
to
look
for
black
george
no
no
she
cried
laying
her
hands
upon
my
arm
no
no
if
do
meet
him
he
he
kill
i
do
think
he
will
said
i
shaking
my
head
oh
do
go
do
go
she
pleaded
shaking
my
arm
in
her
eagerness
he
be
so
strong
and
wild
and
quick
he
give
no
chance
to
speak
be
murder
prudence
said
i
my
mind
is
set
on
it
i
am
going
for
your
sake
for
his
sake
and
my
own
saying
which
i
loosed
her
hands
gently
and
took
down
my
coat
from
its
peg
dear
god
she
exclaimed
staring
down
at
the
floor
with
wide
eyes
if
he
were
to
kill
well
said
i
my
search
would
be
ended
and
i
should
be
a
deal
wiser
in
all
things
than
i
am
and
he
would
be
hanged
said
prudence
shuddering
probably
poor
fellow
said
i
at
this
she
glanced
quickly
up
and
once
again
the
crimson
dyed
her
cheeks
oh
peter
forgive
me
i
i
were
only
thinkin
of
jarge
and
and
quite
right
too
prudence
i
nodded
he
is
indeed
worth
any
good
woman
thoughts
let
it
be
your
duty
to
think
of
him
and
for
him
henceforth
wait
said
she
wait
and
turning
she
fled
through
the
doorway
and
across
the
road
swift
and
graceful
as
any
bird
and
presently
was
back
again
with
something
hidden
in
her
apron
he
be
a
strong
man
and
terrible
in
his
wrath
said
she
and
i
love
him
but
take
this
wi
you
and
if
it
must
be
use
it
because
i
love
him
now
as
she
said
this
she
drew
from
her
apron
that
same
pistol
that
had
served
me
so
well
against
the
ghost
and
thrust
it
into
my
hand
take
it
peter
take
it
but
oh
here
a
great
sob
choked
her
voice
do
do
use
it
if
if
you
can
help
it
for
my
sake
why
prue
said
i
touching
her
bowed
head
very
tenderly
how
can
you
think
i
would
go
up
against
my
friend
with
death
in
my
hand
heaven
forbid
so
i
laid
aside
the
weapon
and
clapping
on
my
hat
strode
out
into
the
glory
of
the
summer
morning
but
left
her
weeping
in
the
shadows
chapter
vii
which
narrates
a
somewhat
remarkable
conversation
to
find
a
man
in
cambourne
woods
even
so
big
a
man
as
black
george
would
seem
as
hard
a
matter
as
to
find
the
needle
in
the
proverbial
bottle
of
hay
the
sun
crept
westward
the
day
declined
into
evening
yet
hungry
though
i
was
i
persevered
in
my
search
not
so
much
in
the
hope
of
finding
him
in
the
which
i
knew
i
must
be
guided
altogether
by
chance
as
from
a
disinclination
to
return
just
yet
to
the
cottage
it
would
be
miserable
there
at
this
hour
i
told
myself
miserable
and
lonely
yet
why
should
i
be
lonely
i
who
had
gloried
in
my
solitude
hitherto
whence
then
had
come
this
change
while
i
stood
thus
seeking
an
answer
to
this
question
and
finding
none
i
heard
some
one
approach
whistling
and
looking
about
beheld
a
fellow
with
an
axe
upon
his
shoulder
who
strode
along
at
a
good
pace
keeping
time
to
his
whistle
he
gave
me
a
cheery
greeting
as
he
came
up
but
without
stopping
you
seem
in
a
hurry
said
i
ah
grinned
the
man
over
his
shoulder
why
i
be
goin
home
said
i
to
supper
he
nodded
and
forthwith
began
to
whistle
again
while
i
stood
listening
till
the
clear
notes
had
died
away
home
said
i
for
the
second
time
and
there
came
upon
me
a
feeling
of
desolation
such
as
i
had
never
known
even
in
my
neglected
days
home
truly
a
sweet
word
a
comfortable
word
the
memory
of
which
has
been
as
oil
and
wine
to
many
a
sick
and
weary
traveler
upon
this
broad
highway
of
life
a
little
word
and
yet
one
which
may
come
betwixt
a
man
and
temptation
covering
him
like
a
shield
roof
and
walls
be
they
cottage
or
mansion
do
not
make
home
thought
i
rather
is
it
the
atmosphere
of
mutual
love
the
intimacies
of
thought
the
joys
and
sorrows
endured
together
and
the
sympathy
that
bond
invisible
yet
stronger
than
death
and
because
i
had
hitherto
known
nothing
of
this
i
was
possessed
of
a
great
envy
for
this
as
i
walked
on
through
the
wood
now
as
i
went
it
was
as
if
there
were
two
voices
arguing
together
within
me
whereof
ensued
the
following
triangular
conversation
myself
yet
i
have
my
books
i
will
go
to
my
lonely
cottage
and
bury
myself
among
my
books
first
voice
assuredly
is
it
for
a
philosopher
to
envy
a
whistling
go
to
second
voice
far
better
a
home
and
loving
companionship
than
all
the
philosophy
of
all
the
schools
surely
happiness
is
greater
than
learning
and
more
to
be
desired
than
wisdom
first
voice
better
rather
that
destiny
had
never
sent
her
to
you
myself
rubbing
my
chin
very
hard
and
staring
at
nothing
in
particular
her
second
voice
her
to
be
sure
she
who
has
been
in
your
thoughts
all
day
long
first
voice
with
lofty
disdain
crass
folly
a
woman
utterly
unknown
who
came
heralded
by
the
roar
of
wind
and
the
rush
of
rain
a
creature
born
of
the
tempest
with
flame
in
her
eyes
and
hair
and
fire
in
the
scarlet
of
her
mouth
a
fierce
passionate
being
given
to
hot
impulse
even
to
the
taking
of
a
man
life
but
said
i
somewhat
diffidently
the

was
a
proved
scoundrel

sophistry

he
was

that

again
can
this
woman
even
faintly
compare
with
your

what
a

should

this

can
a

of

not
preposterous
hereupon
finding
no

i
strode
on
through
the
alleys
of
the
wood
but
when
i
had
gone
some
distance
i
stopped
again
for
there
rushed
over
me
the
recollection
of
the
tender
pity
of
her
eyes
and
the
gentle
touch
of
her
hand
as
when
she
had
bound
up
my
hurts
nevertheless
said
i
doggedly
her
face
can
grow
more
beautiful
with
pity
and
surely
no
woman

could
be
lighter
or
more
gentle
first
voice
with
withering
contempt
our
peter
fellow
is
like
to
become
a
preposterous
ass
but
unheeding
i
thrust
my
hand
into
my
breast
and
drew
out
a
small
handful
of
cambric
whence
came
a
faint
perfume
of
violets
and
closing
my
eyes
it
seemed
that
she
was
kneeling
before
me
her
arms
about
my
neck
as
when
she
had
bound
this
handkerchief
about
my
bleeding
temples
truly
said
i
for
that
one
sweet
act
alone
a
woman
might
be
worth
dying
for
second

or
better
still
living
for
first
voice
in
high
indignation
balderdash
sir
sentimental
balderdash
second
voice
a
truth
incontrovertible
folly
said
i
and
threw
the
handkerchief
from
me
but
next
moment
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
i
stooped
and
picked
it
up
again
first
voice
our
peter
fellow
is
becoming
the
fool
of
fools
myself
no
of
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
fear
because
she
is
gone
and
thus
i
remained
staring
at
the
handkerchief
for
a
great
while
chapter
viii
in
which
i
see
a
vision
in
the
glory
of
the
moon
and
eat
of
a
poached
rabbit
the
moon
was
rising
as
hungry
and
weary
i
came
to
that
steep
descent
i
have
mentioned
more
than
once
which
leads
down
into
the
hollow
and
her
pale
radiance
was
already
upon
the
world
a
sleeping
world
wherein
i
seemed
alone
and
as
i
stood
to
gaze
upon
the
wonder
of
the
heavens
and
the
serene
beauty
of
the
earth
the
clock
in
cranbrook
church
chimed
nine
all
about
me
was
a
soft
stirring
of
leaves
and
the
rustle
of
things
unseen
which
was
as
the
breathing
of
a
sleeping
host
borne
to
my
nostrils
came
the
scent
of
wood
and
herb
and
dewy
earth
while
upstealing
from
the
shadow
of
the
trees
below
the
voice
of
the
brook
reached
me
singing
its
song
now
loud
and
clear
now
sinking
to
a
rippling
murmur
a
melody
of
joy
and
sorrow
of
laughter
and
tears
like
the
greater
melody
of
life
and
presently
i
descended
into
the
shadows
and
walking
on
beside
the
brook
sat
me
down
upon
a
great
boulder
and
straightway
my
weariness
and
hunger
were
forgotten
and
i
fell
truly
it
was
a
night
to
dream
in
a
white
night
full
of
the
moon
and
the
magic
of
the
moon
slowly
she
mounted
upwards
peeping
down
at
me
through
whispering
leaves
checkering
the
shadows
with
silver
and
turning
the
brook
into
a
path
of
silver
for
the
feet
of
fairies
yes
indeed
the
very
air
seemed
fraught
with
a
magic
whereby
the
unreal
became
the
real
and
things
impossible
the
manifestly
possible
and
so
staring
up
at
the
moon
pale
loveliness
i
dreamed
the
deathless
dreams
of
poets
and
romancers
wherein
were
the
notes
of
dreamy
lutes
the
soft
whisper
of
trailing
garments
and
sighing
voices
that
called
beneath
the
breath
between
laura
and
dante
beatrice
came
one
as
proud
and
gracious
and
beautiful
as
they
with
a
red
red
mouth
and
a
subtle
witchery
of
the
eyes
i
dreamed
of
nymphs
and
satyrs
of
fauns
and
dryads
and
of
the
young
endymion
who
on
just
such
another
night
in
just
such
another
leafy
bower
waited
the
coming
of
his
goddess
now
as
i
sat
thus
chin
in
hand
i
heard
a
little
sound
behind
me
the
rustling
of
leaves
and
turning
my
head
beheld
one
who
stood
half
in
shadow
half
in
moonlight
looking
down
at
me
beneath
a
shy
languor
of
drooping
lids
with
eyes
hidden
by
their
lashes
a
woman
tall
and
fair
and
strong
as
dian
self
very
still
she
stood
and
half
wistful
as
if
waiting
for
me
to
speak
and
very
silent
i
sat
staring
up
at
her
as
she
had
been
the
embodiment
of
my
dreams
conjured
up
by
the
magic
of
the
night
while
from
the
mysteries
of
the
woods
stole
the
soft
sweet
song
of
a
nightingale
charmian
said
i
at
last
speaking
almost
in
a
whisper
surely
this
was
the
sweet
goddess
herself
and
i
the
wondering
shepherd
on
mount
ida
solitude
charmian
said
i
again
you
have
come
then
with
the
words
i
rose
you
have
come
then
i
repeated
but
now
she
sighed
a
little
and
turning
her
head
away
laughed
very
sweet
and
low
and
sighed
again
were
you
expecting
me
i
i
think
i
was
that
is
i
i
do
know
i
stammered
then
you
were
not
very
surprised
to
see
me
no
and
you
are
not
very
sorry
to
see
me
no
and
are
you
not
very
glad
to
see
me
yes
here
there
fell
a
silence
between
us
yet
a
silence
that
was
full
of
leafy
stirrings
soft
night
noises
and
the
languorous
murmur
of
the
brook
presently
charmian
reached
out
a
hand
broke
off
a
twig
of
willow
and
began
to
turn
it
round
and
round
in
her
white
fingers
while
i
sought
vainly
for
something
to
say
when
i
went
away
this
morning
she
began
at
last
looking
down
at
the
twig
i
did
think
i
should
ever
come
back
again
no
i
i
supposed
not
said
i
awkwardly
but
you
see
i
had
no
money
no
money
not
a
penny
it
was
not
until
i
had
walked
a
long
long
way
and
was
very
tired
and
terribly
hungry
that
i
found
i
had
enough
to
buy
even
a
crust
of
bread
and
there
was
three
pounds
fifteen
shillings
and
sixpence
in
donald
old
shoe
said
i
sevenpence
she
corrected
sevenpence
said
i
in
some
surprise
three
pounds
fifteen
shillings
and
sevenpence
i
counted
it
oh
said
i
she
nodded
and
in
the
other
i
found
a
small
very
curiously
shaped
piece
of
wood
ah
yes
i
been
looking
for
that
all
the
week
you
see
when
i
made
my
table
by
some
miscalculation
one
leg
persisted
in
coming
out
shorter
than
the
others
which
necessitated
its
being
shored
up
by
a
book
until
i
made
that
block
peter
vibart
virgil
book
she
said
nodding
to
the
twig
said
i
somewhat
disconcerted
it
was
a
pity
to
use
a
book
she
went
on
still
very
intent
upon
the
twig
even
if
that
book
does
belong
to
a
man
with
such
a
name
as
peter
vibart
now
presently
seeing
i
was
silent
she
stole
a
glance
at
me
and
looking
laughed
but
she
continued
more
seriously
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
of
course
nor
me
for
that
matter
and
i
was
trying
to
tell
you
how
hungry
how
hatefully
hungry
i
was
and
i
could
beg
could
i
and
so
and
so
i
i
you
came
back
said
i
i
came
back
being
hungry
famishing
three
pounds
fifteen
shillings
and
sevenpence
is
not
a
great
sum
said
i
but
perhaps
it
will
enable
you
to
reach
your
family
i
afraid
not
you
see
i
have
no
family
your
friends
then
i
have
no
friends
i
am
alone
in
the
world
oh
said
i
and
turned
to
stare
down
into
the
brook
for
i
could
think
only
that
she
was
alone
and
solitary
even
as
i
which
seemed
like
an
invisible
bond
between
us
drawing
us
each
nearer
the
other
whereat
i
felt
ridiculously
pleased
that
this
should
be
so
no
said
charmian
still
intent
upon
the
twig
i
have
neither
friends
nor
family
nor
money
and
so
being
hungry
i
came
back
here
and
ate
up
all
the
bacon
why
i
had
left
much
if
i
remember
six
slices
now
as
she
stood
half
in
shadow
half
in
moonlight
i
could
not
help
but
be
conscious
of
her
loveliness
she
was
no
pretty
woman
beneath
the
high
beauty
of
her
face
lay
a
dormant
power
that
is
ever
at
odds
with
prettiness
and
before
which
i
felt
vaguely
at
a
loss
and
yet
because
of
her
warm
beauty
because
of
the
elusive
witchery
of
her
eyes
the
soft
sweet
column
of
the
neck
and
the
sway
of
the
figure
in
the
moonlight
because
she
was
no
goddess
and
i
no
shepherd
in
arcadia
i
clasped
my
hands
behind
me
and
turned
to
look
down
into
the
stream
indeed
said
i
speaking
my
thought
aloud
this
is
no
place
for
a
woman
after
all
no
said
she
very
softly
no
although
to
be
sure
there
are
worse
places
yes
said
she
i
suppose
so
then
again
it
is
very
far
removed
from
the
world
so
that
a
woman
must
needs
be
cut
off
from
all
those
little
delicacies
and
refinements
that
are
supposed
to
be
essential
to
her
existence
yes
she
sighed
though
what
i
continued
what
on
earth
would
be
the
use
of
a
harp
let
us
say
or
a
pair
of
in
this
wilderness
i
know
one
could
play
upon
the
one
and
curl
one
hair
with
the
other
and
there
is
a
deal
of
pleasure
to
be
had
from
both
said
she
then
also
i
pursued
this
place
as
i
told
you
is
said
to
be
haunted
not
i
went
on
seeing
that
she
was
silent
not
that
you
believe
in
such
things
of
course
but
the
cottage
is
very
rough
and
ill
and
clumsily
furnished
though
to
be
sure
it
might
be
made
comfortable
enough
and
well
she
inquired
as
i
paused
then
said
i
and
was
silent
for
a
long
time
watching
the
play
of
the
moonbeams
on
the
rippling
water
well
said
she
again
at
last
then
said
i
if
you
are
friendless
god
forbid
that
i
should
refuse
you
the
shelter
of
even
such
a
place
as
this
so
if
you
are
homeless
and
without
money
stay
here
if
you
will
so
long
as
it
pleases
you
i
kept
my
eyes
directed
to
the
running
water
at
my
feet
as
i
waited
her
answer
and
it
seemed
a
very
long
time
before
she
spoke
are
you
fond
of
stewed
rabbit
rabbit
said
i
staring
with
onions
onions
oh
i
can
cook
a
little
and
supper
is
waiting
supper
so
if
you
are
hungry
i
am
ravenous
then
why
not
come
home
and
eat
it
home
instead
of
echoing
my
words
and
staring
the
poor
moon
out
of
countenance
come
and
with
the
word
she
turned
and
led
the
way
to
the
cottage
and
behold
the
candles
were
lighted
the
table
was
spread
with
a
snowy
cloth
and
a
pot
simmered
upon
the
hob
a
pot
that
gave
forth
an
odor
delectable
and
over
which
charmian
bent
forthwith
and
into
which
she
gazed
with
an
anxious
brow
and
thrust
an
inquiring
fork
i
think
it
all
right
i
sure
of
it
said
i
inhaling
the
appetizing
aroma
but
pray
where
did
you
get
it
a
man
sold
it
to
me
he
had
a
lot
of
them
hum
said
i
probably
poached
i
bought
this
for
sixpence
out
of
the
old
shoe
sixpence
then
they
certainly
were
poached
these
are
the
cambourne
woods
and
everything
upon
them
fish
flesh
or
fowl
living
or
dead
belongs
to
the
lady
sophia
sefton
of
cambourne
then
perhaps
we
had
better
not
eat
it
said
she
glancing
at
me
over
her
shoulder
but
meeting
my
eye
she
laughed
and
so
we
presently
sat
down
to
supper
and
poached
though
it
may
have
been
that
rabbit
made
a
truly
noble
end
notwithstanding
chapter
ix
which
relates
somewhat
of
charmian
brown
we
were
sitting
in
the
moonlight
now
said
charmian
staring
up
at
the
luminous
heaven
let
us
talk
willingly
i
answered
let
us
talk
of
stars
no
let
us
talk
of
ourselves
as
you
please
very
well
you
begin
well
i
am
a
blacksmith
yes
you
told
me
so
before
and
i
make
horseshoes
he
is
a
blacksmith
and
makes
horseshoes
said
charmian
nodding
at
the
moon
and
i
live
here
in
this
solitude
very
contentedly
so
that
it
is
only
reasonable
to
suppose
that
i
shall
continue
to
live
here
and
make
horseshoes
though
really
i
broke
off
letting
my
eyes
wander
from
my
companion
upturned
face
back
to
the
glowing
sky
once
more
there
is
little
i
could
tell
you
about
so
commonplace
a
person
as
myself
that
is
likely
to
interest
you
no
said
charmian
evidently
not
here
my
gaze
came
down
to
her
face
again
so
quickly
that
i
fancied
i
detected
the
ghost
of
a
smile
upon
her
lips
then
said
i
by
all
means
let
us
talk
of
something
else
yes
she
agreed
let
us
talk
of
the
woman
charmian
charmian
brown
a
tress
of
hair
had
come
loose
and
hung
low
above
her
brow
and
in
its
shadow
her
eyes
seemed
more
elusive
more
mocking
than
ever
and
while
our
glances
met
she
put
up
a
hand
and
began
to
wind
this
glossy
tress
round
and
round
her
finger
well
said
she
well
said
i
supposing
you
begin
but
is
she
likely
to
interest
you
i
think
so
yes
are
you
sure
then
quite
sure
certainly
then
why
do
you
say
so
i
thought
you
would
take
that
for
granted
a
woman
should
take
nothing
for
granted
sir
then
said
i
supposing
you
begin
i
half
a
mind
not
to
she
retorted
curling
the
tress
of
hair
again
and
then
suddenly
what
do
you
think
of
charmian
brown
i
think
of
her
as
little
as
i
can
indeed
sir
indeed
said
i
and
why
pray
because
said
i
knocking
the
ashes
from
my
pipe
because
the
more
i
think
about
her
the
more
incomprehensible
she
becomes
have
you
known
many
women
very
few
i
confessed
but
but
i
am
not
altogether
unfamiliar
with
the
sex
for
i
have
known
a
great
number
in
books
our
blacksmith
said
charmian
addressing
the
moon
again
has
known
many
women
in
books
his
knowledge
is
therefore
profound
and
she
laughed
may
i
ask
why
you
laugh
at
me
oh
said
she
do
you
know
that
women
in
books
and
women
out
of
books
are
no
more
the
same
than
day
and
night
or
summer
and
winter
and
yet
there
are
thousands
of
women
who
exist
for
us
in
books
only
laura
beatrice
trojan
helen
aspasia
the
glorious
phryne
and
hosts
of
others
i
demurred
yes
but
they
exist
for
us
only
as
their
historians
permit
them
as
their
biographers
saw
or
imagined
them
would
petrarch
ever
have
permitted
laura
to
do
an
ungracious
act
or
anything
which
to
his
masculine
understanding
seemed
unfeminine
and
would
dante
have
mentioned
it
had
beatrice
been
guilty
of
one
a
man
can
no
more
understand
a
woman
from
the
reading
of
books
than
he
can
learn
latin
or
greek
from
staring
at
the
sky
of
that
said
i
shaking
my
head
of
that
i
am
not
so
sure
then
personally
you
know
very
little
concerning
women
she
inquired
i
have
always
been
too
busy
said
i
here
charmian
turned
to
look
at
me
again
too
busy
she
repeated
as
though
she
had
not
heard
aright
too
busy
much
too
busy
now
when
i
said
this
she
laughed
and
then
she
frowned
and
then
she
laughed
again
you
would
much
rather
make
a
horseshoe
than
talk
with
a
woman
perhaps
yes
i
think
i
would
oh
said
charmian
frowning
again
but
this
time
she
did
not
look
at
me
you
see
i
explained
turning
my
empty
pipe
over
and
over
rather
aimlessly
when
i
make
a
horseshoe
i
take
a
piece
of
iron
and
having
heated
it
i
bend
and
shape
it
and
with
every
i
see
it
growing
into
what
i
would
have
it
i
am
sure
of
it
from
start
to
finish
now
with
a
woman
it
is
different
you
mean
that
you
can
not
bend
and
shape
her
like
your
horseshoe
still
without
looking
towards
me
i
mean
that
that
i
fear
i
should
never
be
quite
sure
of
a
woman
as
i
am
of
my
horseshoe
why
you
see
said
charmian
beginning
to
braid
the
tress
of
hair
a
woman
can
not
at
any
time
be
said
to
resemble
a
horseshoe
very
much
can
she
surely
said
i
surely
you
know
what
i
mean
there
are
laura
and
beatrice
and
helen
and
aspasia
and
phryne
and
hosts
of
others
said
charmian
nodding
to
the
moon
again
oh
yes
our
blacksmith
has
read
of
so
many
women
in
books
that
he
has
no
more
idea
of
women
out
of
books
than
i
of
sanscrit
and
in
a
little
while
seeing
i
was
silent
she
condescended
to
glance
towards
me
then
i
suppose
under
the
circumstances
you
have
never
been
in
love
in
love
i
repeated
and
dropped
my
pipe
in
love
the
lord
forbid
why
pray
because
love
is
a
disease
a
madness
coming
between
a
man
and
his
life
work
love
said
i
it
is
a
calamity
never
having
been
in
love
himself
our
blacksmith
very
naturally
knows
all
about
it
said
charmian
to
the
moon
i
speak
only
of
such
things
as
i
have
read
i
began
more
books
she
words
of
men
much
wiser
than
i
poets
and
philosophers
written
when
they
were
old
and
charmian
broke
in
when
they
were
quite
incapable
of
judging
the
matter
though
many
a
grave
philosopher
loved
now
did
he
to
be
sure
said
i
rather
hipped
dionysius
lambienus
i
think
says
somewhere
that
a
woman
with
a
big
mouth
is
infinitely
sweeter
in
the
kissing
and
do
you
suppose
he
read
that
in
a
book
she
inquired
glancing
at
me
sideways
why
as
to
that
i
answered
a
philosopher
may
love
but
not
for
the
mere
sake
of
loving
for
whose
sake
then
i
wonder
a
man
who
esteems
trifles
for
their
own
sake
is
a
trifler
but
one
who
values
them
rather
for
the
deductions
that
may
be
drawn
from
them
he
is
a
philosopher
charmian
rose
and
stood
looking
down
at
me
very
strangely
so
said
she
throwing
back
her
head
so
throned
in
lofty
might
superior
smith
thinks
love
a
trifle
does
he
my
name
is
vibart
as
i
think
you
know
said
i
stung
by
her
look
or
her
tone
or
both
yes
she
answered
seeming
to
look
down
at
me
from
an
immeasurable
attitude
but
i
prefer
to
know
him
just
now
as
superior
mr
smith
as
you
will
said
i
and
rose
also
but
even
then
though
she
had
to
look
up
to
me
i
had
the
same
inward
conviction
that
her
eyes
were
regarding
me
from
a
great
height
wherefore
i
attempted
quite
unsuccessfully
to
light
my
pipe
and
after
i
had
struck
flint
and
steel
vainly
perhaps
a
dozen
times
charmian
took
the
box
from
me
and
igniting
the
tinder
held
it
for
me
while
i
lighted
my
tobacco
thank
you
said
i
as
she
returned
the
box
and
then
i
saw
that
she
was
smiling
talking
of
charmian
brown
i
began
but
we
are
not
then
suppose
you
begin
do
you
really
wish
to
hear
about
that
humble
person
very
much
then
you
must
know
in
the
first
place
that
she
is
old
sir
dreadfully
old
but
said
i
she
really
can
not
be
more
than
or
four
at
the
most
she
is
just
returned
charmian
rather
hastily
i
thought
quite
a
child
no
indeed
it
is
experience
that
ages
one
and
by
experience
she
is
quite
two
hundred
the
wonder
is
that
she
still
lives
indeed
it
is
and
being
of
such
a
ripe
age
it
is
probable
that
she
at
any
rate
has
been
in
love
scores
of
times
oh
said
i
puffing
very
hard
at
my
pipe
or
fancied
so
said
charmian
that
i
replied
that
is
a
very
different
thing
do
you
think
so
well
is
it
perhaps
very
well
then
continue
i
beg
now
this
woman
charmian
went
on
beginning
to
curl
the
tress
of
hair
again
hating
the
world
about
her
with
its
shams
its
hypocrisy
and
cruelty
ran
away
from
it
all
one
day
with
a
villain
and
why
with
a
villain
because
he
was
a
villain
that
said
i
turning
to
look
at
her
that
i
do
not
understand
no
i
did
suppose
you
would
she
answered
hum
said
i
rubbing
my
chin
and
why
did
you
run
away
from
him
because
he
was
a
villain
that
was
very
illogical
said
i
but
very
sensible
sir
here
there
fell
a
silence
between
us
and
as
we
walked
now
and
then
her
gown
would
brush
my
knee
or
her
shoulder
touch
mine
for
the
path
was
very
narrow
and
did
you
i
began
suddenly
and
stopped
did
i
what
sir
did
you
love
him
said
i
staring
straight
in
front
of
me
i
ran
away
from
him
and
do
you
love
him
i
suppose
said
charmian
speaking
very
slowly
i
suppose
you
can
not
understand
a
woman
hating
and
loving
a
man
admiring
and
despising
him
both
at
the
same
time
no
i
ca
can
you
understand
one
glorying
in
the
tempest
that
may
destroy
her
riding
a
fierce
horse
that
may
crush
her
or
being
attracted
by
a
will
strong
and
masterful
before
which
all
must
yield
or
break
i
think
i
can
then
said
charmian
this
man
is
strong
and
wild
and
very
masterful
and
so
i
ran
away
with
him
and
do
you
love
him
we
walked
on
some
distance
ere
she
answered
i
do
know
not
sure
then
no
after
this
we
fell
silent
altogether
yet
once
when
i
happened
to
glance
at
her
i
saw
that
her
eyes
were
very
bright
beneath
the
shadow
of
her
drooping
lashes
and
that
her
lips
were
smiling
and
i
pondered
very
deeply
as
to
why
this
should
be
the
cottage
i
closed
the
door
and
waited
the
while
she
lighted
my
candle
and
having
taken
the
candle
from
her
hand
i
bade
her
good
night
but
paused
at
the
door
of
my
chamber
you
feel
quite
safe
here
quite
safe
despite
the
color
of
my
hair
and
eyes
you
have
no
fear
of
peter
smith
none
because
he
is
neither
fierce
nor
wild
nor
masterful
because
he
is
neither
fierce
nor
wild
she
echoed
nor
masterful
said
i
nor
masterful
said
charmian
with
averted
head
so
i
opened
the
door
but
even
then
must
needs
turn
back
again
do
you
think
i
am
so
very
different
from
him
as
different
as
day
from
night
as
the
lamb
from
the
wolf
said
she
without
looking
at
me
good
night
peter
good
night
said
i
and
so
going
into
my
room
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
a
lamb
said
i
tearing
off
my
neckcloth
and
sat
for
some
time
listening
to
her
footstep
and
the
soft
rustle
of
her
petticoats
going
to
and
fro
a
lamb
said
i
again
and
slowly
drew
off
my
coat
as
i
did
so
a
little
cambric
handkerchief
fell
to
the
floor
and
i
kicked
it
forthwith
into
a
corner
a
lamb
said
i
for
the
third
time
but
at
this
moment
came
a
light
tap
upon
the
door
yes
said
i
without
moving
oh
how
is
your
injured
thumb
thank
you
it
is
as
well
as
can
be
expected
does
it
pain
you
very
much
it
is
not
unbearable
said
i
good
night
peter
and
i
heard
her
move
away
but
presently
she
was
back
again
oh
peter
well
are
you
frowning
i
i
think
i
was
why
when
you
frown
you
are
very
like
him
and
have
the
same
square
set
of
the
mouth
and
chin
when
you
are
angry
so
do
please
frown
peter
good
night
good
night
charmian
said
i
and
stooping
i
picked
up
the
little
handkerchief
and
thrust
it
under
my
pillow
chapter
x
i
am
suspected
of
the
black
art
vibart
the
word
had
been
uttered
close
behind
me
and
very
softly
yet
i
started
at
this
sudden
mention
of
my
name
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
my
hammer
poised
above
the
anvil
ere
i
turned
and
faced
the
speaker
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
stubbly
growth
of
grizzled
hair
about
his
lank
jaws
and
he
was
leaning
in
at
that
window
of
the
smithy
which
gave
upon
a
certain
grassy
back
lane
you
spoke
i
think
said
i
i
said
well
well
and
why
should
you
say
and
why
should
you
start
beneath
the
broad
flapping
hat
his
eyes
glowed
with
a
sudden
intensity
as
he
waited
my
answer
it
is
familiar
said
i
ha
familiar
he
repeated
and
his
features
were
suddenly
contorted
as
with
a
strong
convulsion
and
his
teeth
gleamed
between
his
pallid
lips
my
hammer
was
yet
in
my
grasp
and
as
i
met
this
baleful
look
my
fingers
tightened
instinctively
about
the
shaft
familiar
said
he
again
yes
i
nodded
like
your
face
for
it
would
almost
seem
that
i
have
seen
you
somewhere
before
and
i
seldom
forget
faces
nor
do
i
said
the
man
now
while
we
thus
fronted
each
other
there
came
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
and
john
pringle
the
carrier
appeared
followed
by
the
pessimistic
job
marnin
peter
them
began
john
pausing
just
outside
the
smithy
door
you
was
to
finish
arternoon
if
so
be
as
they
bea
done
you
bein
jarge
why
i
can
wait
now
during
this
speech
i
was
aware
that
both
his
and
job
eyes
had
wandered
from
my
bandaged
thumb
to
my
bare
throat
and
become
fixed
there
come
in
and
sit
down
said
i
nodding
to
each
as
i
blew
up
the
fire
come
in
for
a
moment
they
hesitated
then
john
stepped
gingerly
into
the
smithy
closely
followed
by
job
and
watching
them
beneath
my
brows
as
i
stooped
above
the
shaft
of
the
bellows
i
saw
each
of
them
furtively
cross
his
fingers
why
do
you
do
that
john
pringle
said
i
do
what
peter
cross
your
fingers
why
ye
see
peter
said
john
glancing
in
turn
at
the
floor
the
rafters
the
fire
and
the
anvil
but
never
at
me
ye
see
it
be
just
a
kind
o
way
o
mine
but
why
does
job
do
the
same
an
why
do
look
at
a
man
so
sharp
an
retorted
job
sullenly
dang
me
if
it
are
enough
to
send
cold
shivers
up
a
chap
spine
i
never
see
such
a
pair
o
eyes
afore
no
nor
do
want
to
again
nonsense
said
i
my
eyes
ca
hurt
you
an
am
i
to
know
that
am
i
to
be
sure
o
that
an
you
your
throat
all
torn
wi
devil
claws
an
demon
clutches
it
old
amos
says
so
an
i
sez
so
pure
folly
said
i
plucking
the
iron
from
the
fire
and
beginning
to
beat
and
shape
it
with
my
hammer
but
presently
remembering
the
strange
man
who
had
spoken
my
name
i
looked
up
and
then
i
saw
that
he
was
gone
where
is
he
said
i
involuntarily
where
who
inquired
john
pringle
glancing
about
uneasily
the
fellow
who
was
talking
to
me
as
you
came
up
i
did
see
no
fellow
said
job
looking
at
john
and
edging
nearer
the
door
nor
me
neither
chimed
in
john
pringle
looking
at
job
why
he
was
leaning
in
at
the
window
here
not
a
minute
ago
said
i
and
plunging
the
horseshoe
back
into
the
fire
i
stepped
out
into
the
road
but
the
man
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
very
strange
said
i
what
might
been
like
now
inquired
john
he
was
tall
and
thin
and
wore
a
big
flapping
hat
john
pringle
coughed
scratched
his
chin
and
coughed
again
what
is
it
john
i
inquired
why
then
you
could
to
notice
wearin
you
could
to
notice
if
ever
a
pair
o
peter
horns
i
exclaimed
or
a
tail
peter
or
even
a
now
suggested
job
come
said
i
looking
from
one
to
the
other
what
might
you
be
driving
at
why
ye
see
peter
answered
john
coughing
again
and
scratching
his
chin
harder
than
ever
ye
see
peter
it
are
for
a
bein
to
go
away
like
this
if
a
man
as
you

i
doubts
muttered
job
if
a
man
peter
then
i
axes
you
where
is
that
man
before
i
could
answer
this
pointed
question
old
joel
amos
hobbled
up
who
paused
on
the
threshold
to
address
some
one
over
his
shoulder
come
on
james
be
come
james
like
a
man
thus
adjured
another
individual
appeared
a
somewhat
individual
with
colorless
hair
and
eyes
one
who
seemed
to
exhale
an
air
of
apology
as
it
were
from
the
hobnailed
boot
upon
the
floor
to
the
grimy
forefinger
that
touched
the
strawlike
hair
in
salutation

i

a
vivid
belcher
handkerchief
and
apologetically
mopped
his
face

the
others
watched
me
with
varying
expressions
and
so
you
think
that
i
bewitched
dutton
pigs
do
you
said
i
at
last
glancing
from
old
amos
to
the
perspiring
apology
who
immediately
began
to
mop
at
his
face
and
neck
again
and
why
i
continued
seeing
that
nobody
appeared
willing
to
speak
why
should
you
think
it
of
me
peter
ye
bea
like
ordinary
folk
your
eyes

th
an
the
strongest
man
in

there
is
nothing
strange
in
that
either
an
then
you

i
likewise
heerd
o

afore
now
ah
an
knows
one
when
i
sees
it
nonsense
said
i
sternly
nonsense
this
talk
of
ghosts
and
devils
is
sheer
folly
i
am
a
man
like
the
rest
of
you
and
could
not
wish
you
ill
even
if
i
would
come
let
us
all
shake
hands
and
forget
this
folly
and
i
extended
my
hand
to
old
amos
he
glanced
from
it
to
my
face
and
immediately
lowering
his
eyes
shook
his
head
is
the
evil
eye
said
he
and
drew
across
upon
the
floor
with
his
stick
the
eye
nonsense
said
i
again
my
eye
is
no
more
evil
than
yours
or
job
i
never
wished
any
man
harm
yet
nor
wronged
one
and
i
hope
i
never
may
as
for
dutton
pigs
if
he
take
better
care
of
them
and
keep
them
out
of
the
damp
they
will
probably
thrive
better
than
ever
come
shake
hands
but
one
by
one
they
edged
their
way
to
the
door
after
old
amos
until
only
john
pringle
was
left
he
for
a
moment
stood
hesitating
then
suddenly
reaching
out
he
seized
my
hand
and
shook
it
twice
i
call
for
they
in
the
marnin
peter
said
he
and
vanished
arter
all
i
heard
him
say
as
he
joined
the
others

summat
to
ha
shook
wi
a
chap
as
fights
wi
demons
chapter
xi
a
shadow
in
the
hedge
over
the
uplands
to
my
left
the
moon
was
peeping
at
me
very
broad
and
yellow
as
yet
casting
long
shadows
athwart
my
way
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
perfume
of
honeysuckle
abloom
in
the
hedges
a
warm
still
air
wherein
a
deep
silence
brooded
and
in
which
leaf
fluttered
not
and
twig
stirred
not
but
it
was
none
of
this
i
held
in
my
thoughts
as
i
strode
along
whistling
softly
as
i
went
yet
in
a
while
chancing
to
lift
my
eyes
i
beheld
the
object
of
my
reverie
coming
towards
me
through
the
shadows
why
charmian
said
i
uncovering
my
head
why
peter
did
you
come
to
meet
me
it
must
be
nearly
nine
sir
yes
i
had
to
finish
some
work
did
any
one
pass
you
on
the
road
not
a
soul
peter
have
you
an
enemy
not
that
i
know
of
unless
it
be
myself
epictetus
says
somewhere
that
oh
peter
how
dreadfully
quiet
everything
is
said
she
and
shivered
are
you
cold
no
but
it
is
so
dreadfully
still
now
in
one
place
the
lane
narrowing
suddenly
led
between
high
banks
crowned
with
bushes
so
that
it
was
very
dark
there
as
we
entered
this
gloom
charmian
suddenly
drew
closer
to
my
side
and
slipped
her
hand
beneath
my
arm
and
into
my
clasp
and
the
touch
of
her
fingers
was
like
ice
your
hand
is
very
cold
said
i
but
she
only
laughed
yet
i
felt
her
shiver
as
she
pressed
herself
close
against
me
and
now
it
was
she
who
talked
and
i
who
walked
in
silence
or
answered
at
random
for
i
was
conscious
only
of
the
clasp
of
her
fingers
and
the
soft
pressure
of
hip
and
shoulder
so
we
passed
through
this
place
of
shadows
walking
neither
fast
nor
slow
and
ever
her
cold
fingers
clasped
my
fingers
and
her
shoulder
pressed
my
arm
while
she
talked
and
laughed
but
of
what
i
know
not
until
we
had
left
the
dark
place
behind
then
she
sighed
deeply
and
turned
and
drew
her
arm
from
mine
almost
sharply
and
stood
looking
back
with
her
two
hands
pressed
upon
her
bosom
what
is
it
look
she
whispered
pointing
there
where
it
is
darkest
look
now
following
the
direction
of
her
finger
i
saw
something
that
skulked
amid
the
shadows
something
that
slunk
away
and
vanished
as
i
watched
a
man
i
exclaimed
and
would
have
started
in
pursuit
but
hands
were
upon
my
arm
strong
and
compelling
are
you
mad
cried
she
angrily
would
you
give
him
the
opportunity
i
prevented
he
was
waiting
there
to
to
shoot
you
i
think
and
after
we
had
gone
on
some
little
way
i
spoke
was
that
why
you
came
to
meet
me
yes
and
kept
so
close
beside
me
yes
ah
yes
to
be
sure
said
i
and
walked
on
in
silence
and
now
i
noticed
that
she
kept
as
far
from
me
as
the
path
would
allow
are
you
thinking
me
very
unmaidenly
again
sir
no
i
answered
no
you
see
i
had
no
other
way
had
i
told
you
that
there
was
a
man
hidden
in
the
hedge
you
would
have
gone
to
look
and
then
something
dreadful
would
have
happened
how
came
you
to
know
he
was
there
why
after
i
had
prepared
supper
i
climbed
that
steep
path
which
leads
to
the
road
and
sat
down
upon
the
fallen
tree
that
lies
there
to
watch
for
you
and
as
i
sat
there
i
saw
a
man
come
hurrying
down
the
road
a
very
big
man
yes
very
tall
he
seemed
and
as
i
watched
he
crept
in
behind
the
hedge
while
i
was
wondering
at
this
i
heard
your
step
on
the
road
and
you
were
whistling
and
yet
i
seldom
whistle
it
was
you
i
knew
your
step
did
you
charmian
i
do
wish
you
would
not
interrupt
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
said
i
humbly
and
then
i
saw
you
coming
and
the
man
saw
you
too
for
he
crouched
suddenly
i
could
only
see
him
dimly
in
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
but
he
looked
murderous
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
you
reached
his
before
i
did
something
terrible
would
happen
and
so
you
came
to
meet
me
yes
and
walked
close
beside
me
so
that
you
were
between
me
and
the
shadow
in
the
hedge
yes
and
i
thought
i
began
and
stopped
well
peter
here
she
turned
and
gave
me
a
swift
glance
beneath
her
that
it
was
because
you
were
perhaps
rather
glad
to
see
me
charmian
did
not
speak
indeed
she
was
so
very
silent
that
i
would
have
given
much
to
have
seen
her
face
just
then
but
the
light
was
very
dim
as
i
have
said
moreover
she
had
turned
her
shoulder
towards
me
but
i
am
grateful
to
you
i
went
on
very
grateful
and
it
was
very
brave
of
you
thank
you
sir
she
answered
in
a
very
small
voice
and
i
more
than
suspected
that
she
was
laughing
at
me
not
i
therefore
continued
that
there
was
any
real
danger
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
quickly
i
mean
that
in
all
probability
the
man
you
saw
was
black
george
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
who
though
he
may
imagine
he
has
a
grudge
against
me
is
too
much
of
a
man
to
lie
in
wait
to
do
me
hurt
then
why
should
he
hide
in
the
hedge
because
he
committed
the
mistake
of
throwing
the
town
beadle
over
the
churchyard
wall
and
is
consequently
in
hiding
for
the
present
he
has
an
name
and
is
the
manliest
gentlest
truest
and
worthiest
fellow
that
ever
wore
the
leather
apron
seeing
how
perseveringly
she
kept
the
whole
breadth
of
the
path
between
us
i
presently
fell
back
and
walked
behind
her
now
her
head
was
bent
and
thus
i
could
not
but
remark
the
little
curls
and
tendrils
of
hair
upon
her
neck
whose
sole
object
seemed
to
be
to
make
the
white
skin
more
white
by
contrast
peter
said
she
suddenly
speaking
over
her
shoulder
of
what
are
you
thinking
of
a
certain
steak
pasty
that
was
promised
for
my
supper
i
answered
immediately
mendacious
oh
and
what
i
inquired
what
were
you
thinking
i
was
thinking
peter
that
the
shadow
in
the
hedge
may
not
have
been
black
george
after
all
chapter
xii
who
comes
this
table
wobbles
said
charmian
it
does
said
i
but
then
i
notice
that
the
block
is
misplaced
again
then
why
use
a
block
a
book
is
so
clumsy
i
began
or
a
book
why
not
cut
down
the
long
legs
to
match
the
short
one
that
is
really
an
excellent
idea
then
why
did
you
before
because
to
be
frank
with
you
it
never
occurred
to
me
i
suppose
you
are
better
as
a
blacksmith
than
a
carpenter
are
you
peter
and
seeing
i
could
find
no
answer
worthy
of
retort
she
laughed
and
sitting
down
watched
me
while
i
took
my
saw
forthwith
and
shortened
the
three
long
legs
as
she
had
suggested
having
done
which
to
our
common
satisfaction
seeing
the
moon
was
rising
we
went
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
beside
the
cottage
door
and
are
you
a
very
good
blacksmith
she
pursued
turning
to
regard
me
chin
in
hand
i
can
swing
a
hammer
or
shoe
a
horse
with
any
smith
in
kent
except
black
george
and
he
is
the
best
in
all
the
south
country
and
is
that
a
very
great
achievement
peter
it
is
not
a
despicable
one
are
you
quite
satisfied
to
be
able
to
shoe
horses
well
sir
it
is
far
better
to
be
a
good
blacksmith
than
a
bad
poet
or
an
incompetent
prime
minister
meaning
that
you
would
rather
succeed
in
the
little
thing
than
fail
in
the
great
with
your
permission
i
will
smoke
said
i
surely
she
went
on
nodding
her
permission
surely
it
is
nobler
to
be
a
great
failure
rather
than
a
mean
success
success
is
very
sweet
charmian
even
in
the
smallest
thing
for
instance
said
i
pointing
to
the
cottage
door
that
stood
open
beside
her
when
i
built
that
door
and
saw
it
swing
on
its
hinges
i
was
as
proud
of
it
as
though
it
had
been
a
really
good
door
interpolated
charmian
instead
of
a
bad
one
a
bad
one
charmian
it
is
a
very
clumsy
door
and
has
neither
bolt
nor
lock
there
are
no
thieves
hereabouts
and
even
if
there
were
they
would
not
dare
to
set
foot
in
the
hollow
after
dark
and
then
unless
one
close
it
with
great
care
it
sticks
very
tight
that
obviating
the
necessity
of
a
latch
is
rather
to
be
commended
said
i
besides
it
is
a
very
door
peter
i
have
seen
worse
and
will
be
very
draughty
in
cold
weather
a
blanket
hung
across
will
remedy
that
still
it
can
hardly
be
called
a
very
good
door
can
it
peter
here
i
lighted
my
pipe
without
answering
i
suppose
you
make
horseshoes
much
better
than
you
make
doors
i
puffed
at
my
pipe
in
silence
you
are
not
angry
because
i
found
fault
with
your
door
are
you
peter
angry
said
i
not
in
the
least
i
am
sorry
for
that
why
sorry
are
you
never
angry
peter
seldom
i
hope
i
should
like
to
see
you
so
just
once
finding
nothing
to
say
in
answer
to
this
i
smoked
my
pipe
and
stared
at
the
moon
which
was
looking
down
at
us
through
a
maze
of
and
branches
referring
to
horseshoes
said
charmian
at
last
are
you
content
to
be
a
blacksmith
all
your
days
yes
i
think
i
am
were
you
never
ambitious
then
ambition
is
like
rain
breaking
itself
upon
what
it
falls
on
at
least
so
bacon
says
and
oh
bother
bacon
were
you
never
ambitious
peter
i
was
a
great
dreamer
a
dreamer
she
exclaimed
with
fine
scorn
are
dreamers
ever
ambitious
indeed
they
are
the
most
truly
ambitious
i
retorted
their
dreams
are
so
vast
so
infinite
so
far
beyond
all
puny
human
strength
and
capacity
that
they
perforce
must
remain
dreamers
always
epictetus
himself
i
wish
sighed
charmian
i
do
wish
what
do
you
wish
that
you
were
not
that
i
was
not
such
a
pedant
pedant
said
i
somewhat
disconcerted
and
you
have
a
way
of
echoing
my
words
that
is
very
irritating
i
beg
your
pardon
said
i
feeling
much
like
a
chidden
schoolboy
and
i
am
sorry
you
should
think
me
a
pedant
and
you
are
so
dreadfully
precise
and
serious
she
continued
am
i
charmian
and
so
very
solemn
and
austere
and
so
ponderous
and
egotistical
and
calm
yes
you
are
hatefully
calm
and
placid
are
you
peter
and
after
i
had
smoked
thoughtfully
awhile
i
sighed
yes
i
fear
i
may
seem
so
oh
i
forgive
you
thank
you
though
you
need
be
so
annoyingly
humble
about
it
said
she
and
frowned
and
even
while
she
frowned
laughed
and
shook
her
head
and
pray
why
do
you
laugh
because
oh
peter
you
are
such
a
boy
so
you
told
me
once
before
said
i
biting
my
viciously
did
i
peter
you
also
called
me
a
lamb
i
remember
at
least
you
suggested
it
did
i
peter
and
she
began
to
laugh
again
but
stopped
all
at
once
and
rose
to
her
feet
peter
said
she
with
a
startled
note
in
her
voice
do
you
hear
something
yes
said
i
some
one
is
coming
yes
and
they
are
coming
this
way
yes
oh
how
can
you
sit
there
so
quietly
do
you
think
she
began
and
stopped
staring
into
the
shadows
with
wide
eyes
i
think
said
i
knocking
the
ashes
from
my
pipe
and
laying
it
on
the
bench
beside
me
that
all
things
considered
you
were
wiser
to
go
into
the
cottage
for
a
while
no
oh
i
could
do
that
you
would
be
safer
perhaps
i
am
not
a
coward
i
shall
remain
here
of
course
but
i
had
rather
you
went
inside
and
i
much
prefer
staying
where
i
am
then
i
must
ask
you
to
go
inside
charmian
no
indeed
my
mind
is
made
up
then
i
insist
charmian
mr
vibart
she
exclaimed
throwing
up
her
head
you
forget
yourself
i
think
i
permit
no
one
to
order
my
going
and
coming
and
i
obey
no
man
command
then
i
beg
of
you
and
i
refuse
sir
my
mind
is
made
up
and
mine
also
said
i
rising
why
what
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
cried
retreating
as
i
advanced
towards
her
i
am
going
to
carry
you
into
the
cottage
you
would
not
dare
if
you
refuse
to
walk
how
else
can
you
get
there
said
i
anger
amazement
indignation
all
these
i
saw
in
her
eyes
as
she
faced
me
but
anger
most
of
all
oh
you
would
not
dare
she
said
again
and
with
a
stamp
of
her
foot
indeed
yes
i
nodded
and
now
her
glance
wavered
beneath
mine
her
head
drooped
and
with
a
strange
little
sound
that
was
neither
a
laugh
nor
a
sob
and
yet
something
of
each
she
turned
upon
her
heel
ran
into
the
cottage
and
slammed
the
door
behind
her
chapter
xiii
a
pedler
in
arcadia
the
cottage
as
i
have
said
was
entirely
hidden
from
the
chance
observer
by
reason
of
the
foliage
ash
alder
and
bramble
flourished
luxuriantly
growing
very
thick
and
high
with
here
and
there
a
great
tree
but
upon
one
side
there
was
a
little
grassy
glade
or
clearing
rather
some
ten
yards
square
and
it
was
towards
this
that
my
eyes
were
directed
as
i
reseated
myself
upon
the
settle
beside
the
door
and
waited
the
coming
of
the
unknown
though
the
shadows
were
too
deep
for
my
eyes
to
serve
me
yet
i
could
follow
the
newcomer
approach
quite
easily
by
the
sound
he
made
indeed
i
was
particularly
struck
by
the
prodigious
rustling
of
leaves
whoever
it
was
must
be
big
and
bulky
i
thought
and
clad
probably
in
a
long
trailing
garment
all
at
once
i
knew
i
was
observed
for
the
sounds
ceased
and
i
heard
nothing
save
the
distant
bark
of
a
dog
and
the
ripple
of
the
brook
near
by
i
remained
there
for
maybe
a
full
minute
very
still
only
my
fists
clenched
themselves
as
i
sat
listening
and
waiting
and
that
minute
was
an
hour
you
wo
be
wantin
ever
a
broom
now
the
relief
was
so
sudden
and
intense
that
i
had
much
ado
to
keep
from
laughing
outright
you
wo
be
wantin
ever
a
broom
now
inquired
the
voice
again
no
i
answered
nor
yet
a
fine
leather
belt
with
a
steel
buckle
made
in
brummagem
as
ever
was
oh
it
you
is
it
said
the
pedler
and
forthwith
gabbing
dick
stepped
out
of
the
shadows
brooms
on
shoulder
and
bulging
pack
upon
his
back
at
sight
of
which
the
leafy
tumult
of
his
approach
was
immediately
accounted
for
so
it
you
is
it
he
repeated
setting
down
his
brooms
and
spitting
lugubriously
at
the
nearest
patch
of
shadow
yes
i
answered
but
what
brings
you
here
i
be
goin
to
sleep
my
chap
oh
you
do
mind
the
ghost
then
oh

then

head

so

are
given
to
understand
very
well
then
said
the
pedler
there

and
he
turned
to
spit
into
the
shadow
again

he
continued
a
woman

repeated
the
pedler
and
having
turned
this
intelligence
over
in
his
mind
spat
thoughtfully
into
the
shadow
again
you
wo
be
wantin
ever
a
broom
i
think
you
said
no
said
i
very
well
then
he
nodded
and
lifting
his
brooms
made
towards
the
cottage
door
where
are
you
going
to
sleep
in
this
empty
but
it
is
empty
so
much
the
better
nodded
the
pedler
good
night
and
with
the
words
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
door
but
as
he
did
so
it
opened
and
charmian
appeared
the
pedler
fell
back
three
or
four
paces
staring
with
round
eyes
by
goles
he
exclaimed
so
you
are
married
then
now
when
he
said
this
i
felt
suddenly
hot
all
over
even
to
the
very
tips
of
my
ears
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
have
looked
at
charmian
why
why
i
began
but
her
smooth
soft
voice
came
to
my
rescue
no
he
is
not
married
said
she
far
from
it
not
said
the
pedler
so
much
the
better

pedler
drew
a
broom

bundle
and
passed

to
me
one
shillin
and
sixpence
said
he
which

pedler

belt

a
fine
steel
buckle
made
in
yes

said
i
two
shillin
an
sixpence
said
the
pedler
when
i
saw
you

same
belt

nodded
the
pedler
but

money
into
his
hand
and
i
wish
you
good
night

in
a
about
it
ai
you
yes
ah
to
be
sure
nodded
the
fellow
looking
from
me
to
charmian
with
an
evil
leer
early
to
bed
an
come
get
off
said
i
angrily
wot
are
ye
goin
to
turn
me
away
at
this
time
o
night
it
is
not
so
far
to
sissinghurst
said
i
but
lord
i
would
disturb
ye
an
there
two
rooms
ai
there
there
are
plenty
of
comfortable
beds
to
be
had
at
bull
so
you
wo
me
a
night
shelter
eh
no
i
answered
greatly
annoyed
by
the
fellow
persistence
an
you
do
want
to
buy
nothin
for
the
young
woman
a
necklace
or
say
a
pair
o
garters
but
here
meeting
my
eye
he
shouldered
his
brooms
hastily
and
moved
off
and
after
he
had
gone
some
dozen
yards
or
so
he
paused
and
turned
very
well
then
he
shouted
i
as
you
gets
your
knocked
off
ah
an
gets
it
knocked
off
soon
having
said
which
he
spat
up
into
the
air
towards
me
and
trudged
off
chapter
xiv
concerning
black
george
letter
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
great
relief
that
i
watched
the
fellow
out
of
sight
nevertheless
his
very
presence
seemed
to
have
left
a
blight
upon
all
things
for
he
viewing
matters
with
the
material
eye
of
had
thereby
contaminated
them
even
the
air
seemed
less
pure
and
sweet
than
it
had
been
heretofore
so
that
glancing
over
my
shoulder
i
was
glad
to
see
that
charmian
had
the
cottage
here
said
i
to
myself
here
is
in
the
shape
of
a
peddling
fellow
blundering
into
arcadia
in
the
shape
of
a
haunted
cottage
a
woman
and
a
man
straightway
our
pedler
being
misjudges
us
as
indeed
would
every
other
individual
the
world
over
for
arcadia
being
of
itself
abstract
and
immaterial
is
opposed
to
and
incapable
of
being
understood
by
concrete
and
always
will
be
and
there
the
rub
and
yet
said
i
thanks
to
the
wanderer
of
the
roads
who
built
this
cottage
and
hanged
himself
here
and
thanks
to
a
highland
scot
who
performed
wonderfully
on
the
bagpipes
there
is
little
chance
of
any
vagrant
venturing
near
arcadia
again
at
least
until
the
woman
is
gone
or
the
man
is
gone
or
here
going
to
rub
my
chin
being
somewhat
at
a
loss
i
found
that
i
had
been
standing
all
this
while
the
broom
in
one
hand
and
the
belt
in
the
other
and
now
hearing
a
laugh
behind
me
i
turned
and
saw
charmian
was
leaning
in
the
open
doorway
watching
me
and
so
you
are
the
the
cove
with
the
white
hands
and
the
taking
ways
are
you
peter
why
you
were
actually
listening
then
why
of
course
i
was
that
said
i
that
was
very
undignified
but
very
feminine
peter
hereupon
i
threw
the
belt
from
me
one
way
and
the
broom
the
other
and
sitting
down
upon
the
bench
began
to
fill
any
pipe
rather
awkwardly
being
conscious
of
charmian
mocking
scrutiny
poor
poor
black
george
she
sighed
what
do
you
mean
by
that
said
i
quickly
really
i
can
almost
understand
his
being
angry
with
you
why
you
walked
with
her
and
talked
with
her
peter
like
caesar
came
you
saw
you
conquered
here
i
dragged
my
from
my
pocket
so
awkwardly
as
to
bring
the
lining
with
it
and
even
smiled
at
her
peter
and
you
so
rarely
smile
having
struck
flint
and
steel
several
times
without
success
i
thrust
the
back
into
my
pocket
and
fixed
my
gaze
upon
the
moon
is
she
so
very
pretty
peter
i
stared
up
at
the
moon
without
answering
i
wonder
if
you
bother
her
with
your
epictetus
and
and
quotations
i
bit
my
lips
and
stared
up
at
the
moon
or
perhaps
she
likes
your
musty
books
and
philosophy
but
presently
finding
that
i
would
not
speak
charmian
began
to
sing
very
sweet
and
low
as
if
to
herself
yet
when
i
chanced
to
glance
towards
her
i
found
her
mocking
eyes
still
watching
me
now
the
words
of
her
song
were
these
o
my
luve
like
a
red
red
rose
that
newly
sprung
in
june
o
my
luve
like
the
melodie
that
sweetly
played
in
tune
and
so
at
last
unable
to
bear
it
any
longer
i
rose
and
taking
my
candle
went
into
my
room
and
closed
the
door
but
i
had
been
there
scarcely
five
minutes
when
charmian
knocked
oh
peter
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
please
obediently
i
opened
the
door
what
is
it
charmian
you
dropped
this
from
your
pocket
when
you
took
out
your
so
clumsily
said
she
holding
towards
me
a
crumpled
paper
and
looking
down
at
it
i
saw
that
it
was
black
george
letter
to
prudence
now
as
i
took
it
from
her
i
noticed
that
her
hand
trembled
while
in
her
eyes
i
read
fear
and
trouble
and
seeing
this
i
was
for
a
moment
unwontedly
glad
and
then
wondered
at
myself
you
did
not
read
it
of
course
said
i
well
knowing
that
she
had
yes
peter
it
lay
open
and
then
said
i
speaking
my
thought
aloud
you
know
that
she
loves
george
he
means
you
harm
said
she
speaking
with
her
head
averted
and
if
he
killed
you
i
should
be
spared
a
deal
of
sorrow
and
and
mortification
and
other
people
would
be
no
longer
bothered
by
epictetus
and
quotations
she
turned
suddenly
and
crossing
to
the
open
doorway
stood
leaning
there
but
indeed
i
went
on
hurriedly
there
is
no
chance
of
such
a
thing
happening
not
the
remotest
black
george
bark
is
a
thousand
times
worse
than
his
bite
this
letter
means
nothing
and
er
nothing
at
all
i
ended
somewhat
lamely
for
she
had
turned
and
was
looking
at
me
over
her
shoulder
if
he
has
to
and
wait
and
follow
you
and
follow
you
said
she
in
the
same
low
tone
those
are
merely
the
words
of
a
pedler
said
i
your
blood
will
go
soaking
and
soaking
into
the
grass
our
pedler
has
a
vivid
imagination
said
i
lightly
but
she
shook
her
head
and
turned
to
look
out
upon
the
beauty
of
the
night
once
more
while
i
watched
her
chin
in
hand
i
was
angry
with
you
peter
said
she
at
length
because
you
ordered
me
to
do
something
against
my
will
and
i
did
it
and
so
i
tried
to
torment
you
you
will
forgive
me
for
that
wo
you
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
nothing
and
good
night
charmian
here
she
turned
and
coming
to
me
gave
me
her
hand
charmian
brown
will
always
think
of
you
as
a
blacksmith
said
i
as
a
blacksmith
she
repeated
looking
at
me
with
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
but
oftener
as
a
pedant
said
i
as
a
pedant
she
repeated
obediently
but
most
of
all
as
a
well
said
i
as
a
man
she
ended
speaking
with
bent
head
and
here
again
i
was
possessed
of
a
sudden
gladness
that
was
out
of
all
reason
as
i
immediately
told
myself
your
hand
is
very
small
said
i
finding
nothing
better
to
say
smaller
even
than
i
thought
is
it
and
she
smiled
and
glanced
up
at
me
beneath
her
lashes
for
her
head
was
still
bent
and
wonderfully
smooth
and
soft
is
it
said
she
again
but
this
time
she
did
not
look
up
at
me
now
another
man
might
have
stooped
and
kissed
those
slender
shapely
fingers
but
as
for
me
i
loosed
them
rather
suddenly
and
once
more
bidding
her
good
night
my
own
chamber
and
closed
the
door
but
lying
upon
my
bed
i
could
not
sleep
and
fell
to
watching
the
luminous
patch
of
sky
framed
in
my
open
casement
i
thought
of
charmian
of
her
beauty
of
her
strange
whims
and
fancies
her
moods
and
her
contrariness
comparing
her
in
turn
to
all
those
fair
women
i
had
ever
read
of
or
dreamed
over
in
my
books
little
by
little
however
my
thoughts
drifted
to
gabbing
dick
and
black
george
and
with
my
mind
eye
i
could
see
him
as
he
was
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
and
grim
of
mouth
sitting
beneath
some
hedgerow
while
knife
in
hand
he
trimmed
and
trimmed
his
two
bludgeons
one
of
which
was
to
batter
the
life
out
of
me
from
such
disquieting
reflections
i
would
turn
my
mind
to
prudence
to
the
ancient
the
forge
and
the
thousand
and
one
duties
of
the
morrow
i
bethought
me
once
more
of
the
storm
of
the
coming
of
charmian
of
the
fierce
struggle
in
the
dark
of
the
postilion
and
of
charmian
again
and
yet
in
despite
of
me
my
thoughts
would
revert
to
george
and
i
would
see
myself
even
as
the
pedler
pictured
me
out
in
some
secluded
corner
of
the
woods
lying
stiffly
upon
my
back
with
glassy
eyes
staring
up
sightlessly
through
the
whispering
leaves
above
while
my
blood
soaked
and
soaked
into
the
green
and
with
a
blackbird
singing
gloriously
upon
my
motionless
breast
chapter
xv
which
being
in
parenthesis
may
be
skipped
if
the
reader
so
desire
as
this
life
is
a
broad
highway
along
which
we
must
all
of
us
pass
whether
we
will
or
no
as
it
is
a
thoroughfare
sometimes
very
hard
and
cruel
in
the
going
and
beset
by
many
hardships
sometimes
desolate
and
hatefully
monotonous
so
also
must
its
aspect
sooner
or
later
change
for
the
better
and
the
stony
track
overpassed
the
choking
heat
and
dust
left
behind
we
may
reach
some
green
refreshing
haven
shady
with
trees
and
full
of
the
cool
sweet
sound
of
running
waters
then
who
shall
blame
us
if
we
pause
unduly
in
this
grateful
shade
and
lying
upon
our
backs
a
while
gaze
up
through
the
swaying
green
of
trees
to
the
infinite
blue
beyond
ere
we
journey
on
once
more
as
soon
we
must
to
front
whatsoever
of
good
or
evil
lies
waiting
for
us
in
the
hazy
distance
to
just
such
a
place
am
i
now
come
in
this
my
history
the
record
of
a
period
which
i
afterwards
remembered
as
the
happiest
i
had
ever
known
the
memory
of
which
must
remain
with
me
green
and
fragrant
everlastingly
if
in
the
forthcoming
pages
you
shall
find
of
charmian
i
would
say
in
the
first
place
that
it
is
by
her
and
upon
her
that
this
narrative
hangs
and
in
the
second
place
that
in
this
part
of
my
story
i
find
my
greatest
pleasure
though
here
indeed
i
am
faced
with
a
great
difficulty
seeing
that
i
must
depict
as
faithfully
as
may
be
that
most
difficult
that
most
elusive
of
all
created
things
to
wit
a
woman
truly
i
begin
to
fear
lest
my
pen
fail
me
altogether
for
the
very
reason
that
it
is
of
charmian
that
i
would
tell
and
of
charmian
i
understand
little
more
than
nothing
for
what
rule
has
ever
been
devised
whereby
a
woman
mind
may
be
accurately
gauged
and
who
of
all
those
wise
ones
who
have
written
hitherto
poets
romancers
or
historians
has
ever
fathomed
the
why
and
wherefore
of
the
mind
feminine
a
fool
indeed
were
i
to
attempt
a
thing
impossible
i
do
but
seek
to
show
her
to
you
as
i
saw
her
and
to
describe
her
in
so
far
as
i
learned
to
know
her
and
yet
how
may
i
begin
i
might
tell
you
that
her
nose
was
neither
arched
nor
straight
but
perfect
none
the
less
i
might
tell
you
of
her
brows
straight
and
low
of
her
eyes
long
and
of
her
chin
firm
and
round
and
dimpled
and
yet
that
would
not
be
charmian
for
i
could
not
paint
you
the
scarlet
witchery
of
her
mouth
with
its
sudden
bewildering
changes
nor
show
you
how
sweetly
the
lower
lip
curved
up
to
meet
its
mate
i
might
tell
you
that
to
look
into
her
eyes
was
like
gazing
down
into
very
deep
water
but
i
could
never
give
you
their
varying
beauty
nor
the
way
she
had
with
her
lashes
nor
can
i
ever
describe
her
rich
warm
coloring
nor
the
lithe
grace
of
her
body
thus
it
is
that
i
misdoubt
my
pen
of
its
task
and
fear
that
when
you
shall
have
read
these
pages
you
shall
at
best
have
caught
but
a
very
imperfect
reflection
of
charmian
as
she
really
is
wherefore
i
will
waste
no
more
time
or
paper
upon
so
unprofitable
a
task
but
hurry
on
with
my
narrative
leaving
you
to
find
her
out
as
best
you
may
chapter
xvi
concerning
among
other
matters
the
price
of
beef
and
the
lady
sophia
sefton
of
cambourne
charmian
sighed
bit
the
end
of
her
pen
and
sighed
again
she
was
deep
in
her
housekeeping
accounts
adding
and
subtracting
and
between
whiles
regarding
the
result
with
a
rueful
frown
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up
over
her
round
white
arms
and
i
inwardly
wondered
if
the
much
vaunted
phryne
were
ever
more
perfect
in
their
modelling
or
of
a
fairer
texture
had
i
possessed
the
genius
of
a
praxiteles
i
might
have
given
to
the
world
a
masterpiece
of
beauty
to
replace
his
vanished
venus
of
cnidus
but
as
it
happened
i
was
only
a
humble
blacksmith
and
she
a
fair
woman
who
sighed
and
nibbled
her
pen
and
sighed
again
what
is
it
charmian
compound
addition
peter
and
i
hate
figures
i
detest
loathe
and
abominate
them
especially
when
they
wo
balance
then
never
mind
them
said
i
never
mind
them
indeed
the
idea
sir
how
can
i
help
minding
them
when
living
costs
so
much
and
we
so
poor
are
we
said
i
why
of
course
we
are
yes
to
be
sure
i
suppose
we
are
said
i
dreamily
lais
was
beautiful
thais
was
alluring
and
berenice
was
famous
for
her
beauty
but
then
could
either
of
them
have
shown
such
arms
so
long
so
graceful
in
their
every
movement
so
subtly
rounded
in
their
lines
arms
which
for
all
their
seeming
firmness
must
i
thought
be
wonderfully
soft
to
the
touch
and
smooth
as
ivory
and
which
found
a
delicate
sheen
where
the
light
kissed
them
we
have
spent
four
shillings
for
meat
this
week
peter
said
charmian
glancing
up
suddenly
good
said
i
nonsense
sir
four
shillings
is
most
extravagant
oh
is
it
charmian
why
of
course
it
is
oh
said
i
yes
perhaps
it
is
perhaps
said
she
curling
her
lip
at
me
perhaps
indeed
having
said
which
charmian
became
absorbed
in
her
accounts
again
and
i
in
charmian
in
homer
we
may
read
that
the
loveliness
of
briseis
caused
achilles
much
sorrow
ovid
tells
us
that
chione
was
beautiful
enough
to
inflame
two
gods
and
that
antiope
beauty
drew
down
from
heaven
the
mighty
jove
himself
and
yet
was
either
of
them
formed
and
shaped
more
splendidly
than
she
who
sat
so
near
me
frowning
at
what
she
had
written
and
petulantly
biting
her
pen
impossible
said
i
so
suddenly
that
charmian
started
and
dropped
her
pen
which
i
picked
up
feeling
very
like
a
fool
what
did
you
mean
by
peter
i
was
thinking
merely
then
i
wish
you
would
think
so
suddenly
next
time
i
beg
your
pardon
nor
be
so
very
emphatic
about
it
no
said
i
er
no
hereupon
deigning
to
receive
her
pen
back
again
she
recommenced
her
figuring
while
i
began
to
fill
my
pipe
two
shillings
for
tea
excellent
said
i
i
do
wish
she
sighed
raising
her
head
to
shake
it
reproachfully
at
me
that
you
would
be
a
little
more
sensible
i
try
tea
at
twelve
shillings
a
pound
is
a
luxury
undoubtedly
and
to
pay
two
shillings
for
a
luxury
when
we
are
so
poor
is
sinful
is
it
charmian
of
course
it
is
oh
said
i
and
yet
life
without
tea
more
especially
as
you
brew
it
would
be
very
stale
flat
and
unprofitable
and
bacon
and
eggs
one
shilling
and
fourpence
she
went
on
consulting
her
accounts
ah
said
i
not
venturing
on
good
this
time
butter
one
shilling
hum
said
i
cautiously
and
with
the
air
of
turning
this
over
in
my
mind
vegetables
tenpence
to
be
sure
said
i
nodding
my
head
tenpence
certainly
and
bread
peter
this
in
a
voice
of
tragedy
eightpence
excellent
said
i
recklessly
whereat
charmian
immediately
frowned
at
me
oh
peter
said
she
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
you
possess
absolutely
no
idea
of
proportion
here
we
pay
four
shillings
for
meat
and
only
eightpence
for
bread
had
we
spent
less
on
luxuries
and
more
on
necessaries
we
should
have
had
money
in
hand
instead
of
let
me
see
and
she
began
adding
up
the
various
items
before
her
with
soft
quick
little
pats
of
her
fingers
on
the
table
presently
having
found
the
total
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
summoning
my
attention
with
a
tap
of
her
pen
announced
we
have
spent
nine
shillings
and
tenpence
peter
good
indeed
said
i
leaving
exactly
twopence
over
a
penny
for
you
and
a
penny
for
me
i
fear
i
am
a
very
bad
housekeeper
peter
on
the
contrary
you
earn
ten
shillings
a
week
well
and
here
is
exactly
twopence
left
oh
peter
you
are
forgetting
the
tea
and
the
beef
and
and
the
other
luxuries
said
i
struck
by
the
droop
of
her
mouth
but
you
work
so
very
very
hard
and
earn
so
little
and
that
little
i
work
that
i
may
live
charmian
and
lo
i
am
alive
and
dreadfully
poor
and
ridiculously
happy
i
wonder
why
said
she
beginning
to
draw
designs
on
the
page
before
her
indeed
though
i
have
asked
myself
that
question
frequently
of
late
i
have
as
yet
found
no
answer
unless
it
be
my
busy
life
with
the
warm
sun
about
me
and
the
voice
of
the
wind
in
the
trees
yes
perhaps
that
is
it
and
yet
i
do
know
i
went
on
thoughtfully
for
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
my
life
has
always
been
busy
and
and
i
have
always
loved
the
sun
and
the
sound
of
wind
in
trees
yet
like
horace
have
asked
is
happiness
and
looked
for
it
in
vain
and
now
here
in
this
spot
working
as
a
village
smith
it
has
come
to
me
all
unbidden
and
unsought
which
is
very
strange
yes
peter
said
charmian
still
busy
with
her
pen
upon
consideration
i
think
my
thanks
are
due
to
my
uncle
for
dying
and
leaving
me
penniless
do
you
mean
that
he
disinherited
you
in
a
way
yes
he
left
me
his
whole
fortune
provided
that
i
married
a
certain
lady
within
the
year
a
certain
lady
the
lady
sophia
sefton
of
cambourne
said
charmian
pen
stopped
in
the
very
middle
of
a
letter
and
she
bent
down
to
examine
what
she
had
been
writing
oh
said
she
very
softly
the
lady
sophia
sefton
of
cambourne
yes
said
i
and
your
cousin
sir
maurice
were
the
conditions
the
same
in
his
case
precisely
oh
said
charmian
just
as
softly
as
before
and
this
lady
she
will
not
marry
you
no
i
answered
are
you
quite
sure
certain
you
see
i
never
intend
to
ask
her
charmian
suddenly
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
me
why
not
peter
because
should
i
ever
marry
a
remote
contingency
and
most
improbable
i
am
sufficiently
to
prefer
to
exert
my
own
choice
in
the
matter
moreover
this
lady
is
a
celebrated
toast
and
it
would
be
most
repugnant
to
me
that
my
wife
name
should
ever
have
been
bandied
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
hiccoughed
out
over
slopping
wineglasses
the
pen
slipped
from
charmian
fingers
to
the
floor
and
before
i
could
pick
it
up
she
had
forestalled
me
so
that
when
she
raised
her
head
she
was
flushed
with
stooping
have
you
ever
seen
this
lady
peter
never
but
i
have
heard
of
her
who
has
not
what
have
you
heard
that
she
galloped
her
horse
up
and
down
the
steps
of
cathedral
for
one
thing
what
more
that
she
is
proud
and
passionate
and
sudden
of
temper
in
a
word
a
virago
virago
said
charmian
flinging
up
her
head
virago
i
nodded
though
she
is
handsome
i
understand
in
a
strapping
way
and
i
have
it
on
very
excellent
authority
that
she
is
a
goddess
a
peach
and
a
veritable
plum
is
a
hateful
word
peter
but
very
descriptive
and
does
she
interest
you
a
little
peter
not
in
the
least
said
i
and
pray
why
not
because
i
care
very
little
for
either
peaches
or
plums
or
goddesses
peter
not
if
she
is
big
and
strapping
and
possesses
a
temper
i
suppose
to
such
a
philosopher
as
you
a
woman
or
a
goddess
or
not
can
scarcely
compare
with
or
hope
to
rival
an
old
book
can
she
sir
why
that
depends
charmian
on
what
on
the
book
said
charmian
rested
her
round
elbows
upon
the
table
and
setting
her
chin
in
her
hands
stared
squarely
at
me
peter
said
she
yes
charmian
if
ever
you
did
meet
this
lady
i
think
well
i
know
what
that
you
would
fall
a
very
easy
victim
i
think
not
said
i
you
would
be
her
slave
in
a
month
three
weeks
or
much
less
preposterous
i
exclaimed
if
she
set
herself
to
make
you
that
would
be
very
immodest
said
i
besides
no
woman
can
make
a
man
love
her
do
your
books
teach
you
that
peter
here
finding
i
did
not
answer
she
laughed
and
nodded
her
head
at
me
you
would
be
head
over
ears
in
love
before
you
knew
it
i
think
not
said
i
smiling
you
are
the
kind
of
man
who
would
grow
sick
with
love
and
never
know
what
ailed
him
any
man
in
such
a
condition
would
be
a
pitiful
ass
said
charmian
only
laughed
at
me
again
and
went
back
to
her
scribbling
then
if
this
lady
married
you
said
she
suddenly
you
would
be
a
gentleman
of
good
position
and
standing
yes
i
suppose
so
and
probably
miserable
and
rich
peter
i
should
have
more
than
enough
instead
of
being
a
village
blacksmith
with
just
enough
and
absurdly
happy
and
content
i
added
which
is
far
more
desirable
at
least
i
think
so
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
would
rather
exist
here
and
make
horseshoes
all
your
life
than
live
respected
and
rich
and
married
to
and
married
to
the
lady
sophia
infinitely
said
i
then
your
cousin
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
is
free
to
woo
and
win
her
and
your
uncle
fortune
and
i
wish
him
well
of
his
bargain
i
nodded
as
for
me
i
shall
probably
continue
to
live
here
and
make
horseshoes
wifeless
and
content
is
marriage
so
hateful
to
you
in
the
abstract
no
for
in
my
mind
there
exists
a
woman
whom
i
think
i
could
love
very
greatly
but
in
the
actual
yes
because
there
is
no
woman
in
all
the
world
that
is
like
this
woman
of
my
mind
is
she
so
flawlessly
perfect
this
imaginary
woman
she
is
one
whom
i
would
respect
for
her
intellect
yes
whom
i
would
honor
for
her
proud
virtue
yes
peter
whom
i
would
worship
for
her
broad
charity
her
gentleness
and
spotless
purity
yes
peter
and
love
with
all
my
strength
for
her
warm
sweet
womanhood
in
a
word
she
is
the
epitome
of
all
that
is
true
and
womanly
that
is
to
say
as
you
understand
such
things
sir
and
all
your
knowledge
of
woman
and
her
virtues
and
failings
you
have
learned
from
your
books
therefore
misrepresented
by
history
and
distorted
by
romance
it
is
utterly
false
and
unreal
and
of
course
this
imaginary
creature
of
yours
is
ethereal
bloodless
sexless
unnatural
and
quite
impossible
now
when
she
spoke
thus
i
laid
down
my
pipe
and
stared
but
before
i
could
get
my
breath
she
began
again
with
curling
lip
and
lashes
that
drooped
disdainfully
i
quite
understand
that
there
can
be
no
woman
worthy
of
peter
vibart
she
whom
he
would
honor
with
marriage
must
be
specially
created
for
him
ah
but
some
day
a
woman
a
real
live
woman
will
come
into
his
life
and
the
touch
of
her
hand
the
glance
of
her
eyes
the
warmth
of
her
breath
will
dispel
this
poor
flaccid
misty
creature
of
his
imagination
who
will
fade
and
fade
and
vanish
into
nothingness
and
when
the
real
woman
has
shown
him
how
utterly
false
and
impossible
this
dream
woman
was
then
peter
vibart
i
hope
she
will
laugh
at
you
as
i
do
and
turn
her
back
upon
you
as
i
do
and
leave
you
for
the
very
superior
very
pedantic
pedant
that
you
are
and
scorn
you
as
i
do
most
of
all
because
you
are
merely
a
creature
with
the
word
she
flung
up
her
head
and
stamped
her
foot
at
me
and
turning
swept
out
through
the
open
door
into
the
moonlight
creature
said
i
and
so
sat
staring
at
the
table
and
the
walls
and
the
floor
and
the
rafters
in
a
blank
amazement
but
in
a
while
my
amazement
growing
i
went
and
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
at
charmian
but
saying
nothing
and
as
i
watched
she
began
to
sing
softly
to
herself
and
putting
up
her
hand
drew
the
comb
from
her
hair
so
that
it
fell
down
rippling
about
her
neck
and
shoulders
and
singing
softly
thus
she
shook
her
hair
about
her
so
that
i
saw
it
curled
far
below
her
waist
stooped
her
head
and
parting
it
upon
her
neck
drew
it
over
either
shoulder
whence
it
flowed
far
down
over
her
bosom
in
two
glorious
waves
for
the
moon
peeping
through
the
rift
in
the
leaves
above
sent
down
her
beams
to
wake
small
fires
in
it
that
came
and
went
and
winked
with
her
breathing
charmian
you
have
glorious
hair
said
i
speaking
on
the
impulse
a
thing
i
rarely
do
but
charmian
only
combed
her
tresses
and
went
on
singing
to
herself
charmian
said
i
again
what
did
you
mean
when
you
called
me
a
creature
charmian
went
on
singing
you
called
me
a
once
before
to
be
told
that
i
am
superior
also
is
most
disquieting
i
fear
my
manner
must
be
very
unfortunate
to
afford
you
such
an
opinion
of
me
charmian
went
on
singing
naturally
i
am
much
perturbed
and
doubly
anxious
to
know
what
you
wish
me
to
understand
by
the
epithet
charmian
went
on
singing
wherefore
seeing
she
did
not
intend
to
answer
me
i
presently
the
cottage
now
it
is
ever
my
custom
when
at
all
troubled
or
put
out
in
any
way
to
seek
consolation
in
my
books
hence
i
now
took
up
my
homer
and
trimming
the
candles
sat
down
at
the
table
in
a
little
while
charmian
came
in
still
humming
the
air
of
her
song
and
not
troubling
even
to
glance
in
my
direction
some
days
before
at
her
request
i
had
brought
her
linen
and
lace
and
ribands
from
cranbrook
and
these
she
now
took
out
together
with
needle
and
cotton
and
sitting
down
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
began
to
sew
she
was
still
humming
and
this
of
itself
distracted
my
mind
from
the
lines
before
me
moreover
my
eye
was
fascinated
by
the
gleam
of
her
flying
needle
and
i
began
to
debate
within
myself
what
she
was
making
it
whatever
it
might
be
was
ruffled
and
edged
with
lace
and
caught
here
and
there
with
little
bows
of
blue
riband
and
from
these
and
divers
other
evidences
i
had
concluded
it
to
be
a
garment
of
some
sort
and
was
casting
about
in
my
mind
to
account
for
these
bows
of
riband
when
glancing
up
suddenly
she
caught
my
eye
whereupon
for
no
reason
in
the
world
i
felt
suddenly
guilty
to
hide
which
i
began
to
search
through
my
pockets
for
my
pipe
on
the
mantelshelf
said
she
what
is
your
pipe
thank
you
said
i
and
reached
it
down
what
are
you
reading
she
inquired
is
it
of
helen
or
aspasia
or
phryne
neither
it
is
the
parting
of
hector
and
andromache
i
answered
is
it
very
interesting
yes
then
why
do
your
eyes
wander
so
often
from
the
page
i
know
many
of
the
lines
by
heart
said
i
and
having
lighted
my
pipe
i
took
up
the
book
and
once
more
began
to
read
yet
i
was
conscious
all
the
time
of
charmian
flashing
needle
also
she
had
begun
to
hum
again
and
after
i
had
endeavored
to
read
and
charmian
had
hummed
for
perhaps
five
minutes
i
lowered
my
book
and
sighing
glanced
at
her
i
am
trying
to
read
charmian
so
i
see
and
your
humming
confuses
me
it
is
very
quiet
outside
peter
but
i
can
not
read
by
moonlight
charmian
then
do
read
peter
here
she
nibbled
her
thread
with
white
teeth
and
held
up
what
she
had
been
sewing
to
view
the
effect
of
a
bow
of
riband
with
her
head
very
much
on
one
side
and
i
inwardly
wondered
that
she
should
spend
so
much
care
upon
such
frippery
all
senseless
bows
and
laces
to
hum
is
a
very
disturbing
habit
said
i
to
smoke
an
pipe
is
worse
much
worse
peter
i
beg
your
pardon
said
i
and
laid
the
offending
object
back
upon
the
mantel
are
you
angry
peter
not
in
the
least
i
am
only
sorry
that
my
smoking
annoyed
you
had
i
known
before
it
did
annoy
me
in
the
least
but
from
what
you
said
i
understood
no
peter
you
did
not
understand
you
never
understand
and
i
think
you
ever
will
understand
anything
but
your
helens
and
phrynes
and
your
latin
and
greek
philosophies
and
that
is
what
makes
you
so
very
annoying
and
so
so
quaintly
original
but
you
certainly
found
fault
with
my
pipe
naturally
did
you
find
fault
with
my
humming
really
said
i
really
i
fail
to
see
of
course
you
do
sighed
charmian
whereupon
there
fell
a
silence
between
us
during
which
she
sewed
industriously
and
i
went
forth
with
brave
hector
to
face
the
mighty
achilles
but
my
eye
had
traversed
barely
twenty
lines
when
peter
yes
do
you
remember
my
giving
you
a
locket
yes
where
is
it
oh
i
have
it
still
somewhere
somewhere
sir
she
repeated
glancing
at
me
with
raised
brows
somewhere
safe
said
i
fixing
my
eyes
upon
my
book
it
had
a
riband
attached
had
it
yes
a
pink
riband
if
i
remember
yes
pink
no
it
was
blue
said
i
unguardedly
are
you
sure
peter
and
here
glancing
up
i
save
that
she
was
watching
me
beneath
her
lashes
yes
i
answered
that
is
i
think
so
then
you
are
not
sure
yes
i
am
said
i
it
was
a
blue
riband
and
i
turned
over
a
page
very
ostentatiously
oh
said
charmian
and
there
was
another
pause
during
which
i
construed
probably
fifty
lines
or
so
peter
well
where
did
you
say
it
was
now
my
locket
i
did
say
it
was
anywhere
no
you
said
it
was
in
a
rather
vague
sort
of
way
peter
well
perhaps
i
did
said
i
frowning
at
my
book
it
is
not
very
valuable
but
i
prized
it
for
association
sake
peter
ah
yes
to
be
sure
said
i
feigning
to
be
wholly
absorbed
i
was
wondering
if
you
ever
wear
it
peter
wear
it
i
exclaimed
and
glancing
furtively
down
at
myself
i
was
relieved
to
see
that
there
were
no
signs
of
a
betraying
blue
riband
wear
it
said
i
again
why
should
i
wear
it
why
indeed
peter
unless
it
was
because
it
was
there
to
wear
suddenly
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
and
taking
up
a
candle
began
looking
about
the
floor
what
have
you
lost
my
needle
i
think
it
must
have
fallen
under
the
table
and
needles
are
precious
in
this
wilderness
wo
you
please
help
me
to
find
it
with
pleasure
said
i
getting
down
upon
my
hands
and
knees
and
together
we
began
to
hunt
for
the
lost
needle
now
in
our
search
it
chanced
that
we
drew
near
together
and
once
her
hand
touched
mine
and
once
her
soft
hair
brushed
my
cheek
and
there
stole
over
me
a
perfume
like
the
breath
of
violets
the
fragrance
that
i
always
associated
with
her
faint
and
sweet
and
alluring
so
much
so
that
i
drew
back
from
further
chance
of
contact
and
kept
my
eyes
directed
to
the
floor
and
after
i
had
sought
vainly
for
some
time
i
raised
my
head
and
looked
at
charmian
to
find
her
regarding
me
with
a
very
strange
expression
what
is
it
i
inquired
have
you
found
the
needle
charmian
sat
back
on
her
heels
and
laughed
softly
oh
yes
i
found
the
needle
peter
that
is
i
never
lost
it
why
then
what
what
did
you
mean
for
answer
she
raised
her
hand
and
pointed
to
my
breast
then
glancing
hurriedly
down
i
saw
that
the
locket
had
slipped
forward
through
the
bosom
of
my
shirt
and
hung
in
plain
view
i
made
an
instinctive
movement
to
hide
it
but
hearing
her
laugh
looked
at
her
instead
so
this
was
why
you
asked
me
to
stoop
to
find
your
needle
yes
peter
then
you
knew
of
course
i
knew
hum
said
i
a
distant
clock
chimed
eleven
and
charmian
began
to
fold
away
her
work
seeing
which
i
rose
and
took
up
my
candle
and
pray
well
and
pray
said
i
staring
hard
at
the
flame
of
my
candle
how
did
you
happen
to
find
out
very
simply
i
saw
the
riband
round
your
neck
days
ago
good
night
peter
oh
said
i
good
night
chapter
xvii
the
omen
my
lady
sweet
arise
my
lady
sweet
arise
with
everything
that
pretty
is
my
lady
sweet
arise
arise
arise
it
was
morning
and
charmian
was
singing
the
pure
rich
notes
floated
in
at
my
open
lattice
and
i
heard
the
clatter
of
her
pail
as
she
went
to
fetch
water
from
the
brook
wherefore
i
presently
stepped
out
into
the
sunshine
my
coat
and
neckcloth
across
my
arm
to
plunge
my
head
and
face
into
the
brook
and
carry
back
the
heavy
bucket
for
her
as
was
my
custom
being
come
to
the
brook
i
found
the
brimming
bucket
sure
enough
but
no
charmian
i
was
looking
about
wonderingly
when
she
began
to
sing
again
and
guided
by
this
i
espied
her
kneeling
beside
the
stream
the
water
ran
deep
and
very
still
just
here
overhung
by
ash
and
alder
and
willow
whose
slender
curving
branches
formed
a
leafy
bower
wherein
she
half
knelt
half
sat
bending
over
to
regard
herself
in
the
placid
water
for
a
long
moment
she
remained
thus
studying
her
reflection
intently
in
this
crystal
mirror
and
little
by
little
her
song
died
away
then
she
put
up
her
hands
and
began
to
rearrange
her
hair
with
swift
dexterous
fingers
apostrophizing
her
watery
image
the
while
in
this
wise
my
dear
you
are
growing
positively
i
vow
you
are
your
enemies
might
almost
call
you
strapping
alack
and
then
your
complexion
my
dear
your
adorable
complexion
she
went
on
with
a
rueful
shake
of
her
head
you
are
as
brown
as
a
gipsy
not
that
you
need
go
breaking
your
heart
over
it
for
between
you
and
me
my
dear
i
think
it
rather
improves
you
the
pity
of
it
is
that
you
have
no
one
to
appreciate
you
properly
to
render
to
your
charms
the
homage
they
deserve
no
one
not
a
soul
my
dear
your
hermit
bless
you
can
see
or
think
of
nothing
that
exists
out
of
a
book
which
between
you
and
me
and
the
bucket
yonder
is
perhaps
just
as
well
and
yet
heigho
to
be
so
lovely
and
so
forlorn
indeed
i
could
shed
tears
for
you
if
it
would
not
make
your
eyelids
swell
and
your
classic
nose
turn
red
here
she
sighed
again
and
taking
a
tendril
of
hair
between
her
fingers
transformed
it
very
cleverly
into
a
small
curl
yes
your
tan
certainly
becomes
you
my
dear
she
went
on
nodding
to
her
reflection
not
that
he
will
ever
notice
dear
heart
no
were
you
suddenly
to
turn
as
black
as
a
hottentot
before
his
very
eyes
he
would
go
on
serenely
smoking
his
pipe
and
talk
to
you
of
epictetus
heighho
sighing
thus
she
broke
off
a
spray
of
leaves
and
proceeded
to
twine
them
in
among
the
lustrous
coils
of
her
hair
bending
over
her
reflection
meanwhile
and
turning
her
head
this
way
and
that
to
note
the
effect
yes
said
she
at
last
nodding
at
her
image
with
a
satisfied
air
that
touch
of
green
sets
off
your
gipsy
complexion
admirably
my
dear
i
could
positively
kiss
you
i
vow
i
could
and
i
am
hard
to
please
anthony
himself
meeting
you
alone
in
the
desert
would
at
least
have
run
away
from
you
and
that
would
have
been
some
tribute
to
your
charms
but
our
philosopher
will
just
glance
at
you
with
his
slow
grave
smile
and
tell
you
in
his
solemn
affable
way
that
it
is
a
very
fine
morning
heigho
here
somewhat
late
in
the
day
perhaps
perceiving
that
i
was
playing
eavesdropper
i
moved
cautiously
away
and
taking
up
the
pail
returned
to
the
cottage
i
now
filled
the
kettle
and
set
it
upon
the
fire
and
proceeded
to
spread
the
cloth
a
luxurious
institution
of
charmian
on
which
she
insisted
and
to
lay
out
the
breakfast
things
in
the
midst
of
which
however
chancing
to
fall
into
a
reverie
i
became
oblivious
of
all
things
till
roused
by
a
step
behind
me
and
turning
beheld
charmian
standing
with
the
glory
of
the
sun
about
her
like
the
spirit
of
summer
herself
broad
of
hip
and
shoulder
yet
slender
and
long
of
limb
all
warmth
and
life
and
long
soft
curves
from
throat
to
ankle
perfect
with
vigorous
youth
from
the
leaves
that
crowned
her
beauty
to
the
foot
that
showed
beneath
her
gown
and
as
i
gazed
upon
her
silent
and
wondering
lo
though
her
mouth
was
solemn
yet
there
was
laughter
in
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
well
sir
have
you
no
greeting
for
me
it
is
a
very
fine
morning
said
i
and
now
the
merriment
overflowed
her
eyes
and
she
laughed
yet
blushed
a
little
too
and
lowered
her
eyes
from
mine
and
said
still
laughing
oh
peter
the
teapot
do
mind
the
teapot
teapot
i
repeated
and
then
i
saw
that
i
still
held
it
in
my
hand
pray
sir
what
might
you
be
going
to
do
with
the
teapot
in
one
hand
and
that
fork
in
the
other
i
was
going
to
make
the
tea
i
remember
said
i
is
that
why
you
were
standing
there
staring
at
the
kettle
while
it
boiled
over
i
forgot
all
about
the
kettle
said
i
so
charmian
took
the
teapot
from
me
and
set
about
brewing
the
tea
singing
merrily
the
while
anon
she
began
to
fry
the
bacon
giving
each
individual
slice
its
due
amount
of
care
and
attention
but
her
eyes
chancing
to
meet
mine
the
song
died
upon
her
lip
her
lashes
flickered
and
fell
while
up
from
throat
to
brow
there
crept
a
slow
hot
wave
of
crimson
and
in
that
moment
i
turned
away
and
strode
down
to
the
brook
now
it
happened
that
i
came
to
that
same
spot
where
she
had
leaned
and
flinging
myself
down
i
fell
to
studying
my
reflection
in
the
water
even
as
she
had
done
heretofore
though
i
had
paid
scant
heed
to
my
appearance
i
had
been
content
in
a
certain
impersonal
sort
of
way
had
dressed
in
the
fashion
and
taken
advantage
of
such
adornments
as
were
in
favor
as
much
from
habit
as
from
any
set
design
but
now
lying
beside
the
brook
with
my
chin
propped
in
my
hands
i
began
to
study
myself
critically
feature
by
feature
as
i
had
never
dreamed
of
doing
before
mirrored
in
the
clear
waters
i
beheld
a
face
lean
and
brown
and
with
lank
black
hair
eyes
dark
and
of
a
strange
brilliance
looked
at
me
from
beneath
a
steep
prominence
of
brow
i
saw
a
somewhat
nose
with
thin
nervous
nostrils
a
long
cleft
chin
and
a
disdainful
mouth
truly
a
saturnine
face
cold
and
dark
and
unlovely
and
thus
even
as
i
gazed
the
mouth
grew
still
more
disdainful
and
the
heavy
brow
lowered
blacker
and
more
forbidding
and
yet
in
that
same
moment
i
found
myself
sighing
while
i
strove
to
lend
some
order
to
the
wildness
of
my
hair
fool
said
i
and
plunged
my
head
beneath
the
water
and
held
it
there
so
long
that
i
came
up
puffing
and
blowing
whereupon
i
caught
up
the
towel
and
fell
to
rubbing
myself
vigorously
so
that
presently
looking
down
into
the
water
again
i
saw
that
my
hair
was
wilder
than
ever
all
rubbed
into
long
straightway
i
lifted
my
hands
and
would
have
smoothed
it
somewhat
but
checked
the
impulse
let
be
said
i
to
myself
turning
away
let
be
i
am
as
i
am
and
shall
be
henceforth
in
very
truth
a
village
blacksmith
and
content
so
to
be
absolutely
content
at
sight
of
me
charmian
burst
out
laughing
the
which
though
i
had
expected
it
angered
me
nevertheless
why
peter
she
exclaimed
you
look
like
a
very
low
fellow
said
i
say
a
village
blacksmith
who
has
been
at
his
ablutions
if
you
only
had
rings
in
your
ears
and
a
scarf
round
your
head
you
would
be
the
image
of
a
spanish
brigand
or
like
the
man
mina
whose
exploits
the
gazette
is
full
of
a
spanish
general
i
think
a
guerrilla
leader
said
i
taking
my
place
at
the
table
and
a
singularly
villain
indeed
i
think
it
probable
that
we
much
resemble
one
another
is
it
any
wonder
that
i
am
shunned
by
my
kind
avoided
by
the
ignorant
and
regarded
askance
by
the
rest
why
peter
said
charmian
regarding
me
with
grave
eyes
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
the
country
folk
hereabout
go
out
of
their
way
to
avoid
crossing
my
path
not
that
i
suppose
they
ever
heard
of
mina
but
because
of
my
looks
your
looks
they
think
me
possessed
of
the
eye
or
some
such
folly
may
i
cut
you
a
piece
of
bread
oh
peter
already
by
divers
rustics
i
am
credited
with
having
cast
a
deadly
spell
upon
certain
unfortunate
pigs
with
having
fought
hand
to
hand
with
the
hosts
of
the
nethermost
pit
and
with
having
sold
my
soul
to
the
devil
may
i
trouble
you
to
pass
the
butter
oh
peter
how
foolish
of
them
and
how
excusable
considering
their
ignorance
and
superstition
said
i
mine
i
am
well
aware
is
not
a
face
to
win
me
the
heart
of
man
woman
or
child
they
especially
women
and
children
share
in
common
with
dogs
and
horses
that
divine
attribute
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
we
call
whereby
they
love
or
hate
for
the
mere
tone
of
a
voice
the
glance
of
an
eye
the
motion
of
a
hand
and
the
love
or
hate
once
given
the
prejudice
for
or
against
is
seldom
wholly
overcome
indeed
said
charmian
i
believe
in
first
impressions
being
a
woman
said
i
being
a
woman
she
nodded
and
the
instinct
of
dog
and
child
and
woman
has
often
proved
true
in
the
end
surely
instinct
is
always
true
said
i
i
thank
you
for
another
cup
of
tea
yet
strangely
enough
dogs
generally
make
friends
with
me
very
readily
and
the
few
children
to
whom
i
spoken
have
neither
screamed
nor
run
away
from
me
still
as
i
said
before
i
am
aware
that
my
looks
are
scarcely
calculated
to
gain
the
love
of
man
woman
or
child
not
that
it
matters
greatly
seeing
that
i
am
likely
to
hold
very
little
converse
with
either
there
is
one
woman
peter
to
whom
you
have
talked
by
the
hour
together
and
who
is
doubtless
weary
enough
of
it
all
more
especially
of
epictetus
and
trojan
helen
two
lumps
of
sugar
peter
thank
you
women
are
very
like
flowers
i
began
that
is
a
very
profound
remark
sir
more
especially
coming
from
one
who
has
studied
and
knows
womankind
so
deeply
and
it
is
a
pity
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
their
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
and
philosophical
blacksmiths
peter
more
so
if
they
be
poor
blacksmiths
i
said
peter
you
probably
find
your
situation
horribly
lonely
here
i
went
on
after
a
pause
yes
it
nice
and
lonely
peter
and
undoubtedly
this
cottage
is
very
poor
and
mean
and
er
humble
charmian
smiled
and
shook
her
head
but
then
charmian
brown
is
a
very
humble
person
sir
and
you
have
even
the
luxury
of
a
mirror
to
dress
your
hair
by
is
it
so
very
clumsily
dressed
sir
no
no
said
i
hastily
indeed
i
was
thinking
well
peter
that
it
was
very
beautiful
why
you
told
me
that
last
night
come
what
do
you
think
of
it
this
morning
with
those
leaves
in
it
it
is
even
more
so
charmian
laughed
and
rising
swept
me
a
stately
curtesy
after
all
sir
we
find
there
be
exceptions
to
every
rule
you
mean
even
blacksmiths
and
in
a
while
having
finished
my
breakfast
i
rose
and
taking
my
hat
bade
charmian
good
morning
and
so
came
to
the
door
but
on
the
threshold
i
turned
and
looked
back
at
her
she
had
risen
and
stood
leaning
with
one
hand
on
the
table
now
in
the
other
she
held
the
breadknife
and
her
eyes
were
upon
mine
and
lo
wonder
of
wonders
once
again
but
this
time
sudden
and
swift
up
from
the
round
full
column
of
her
throat
up
over
cheek
and
brow
there
rushed
that
vivid
tide
of
color
her
eyes
grew
suddenly
deep
and
soft
and
then
were
hidden
her
lashes
and
in
that
same
moment
the
knife
slipped
from
her
grasp
and
falling
point
downwards
stood
quivering
in
the
floor
between
us
an
ugly
thing
that
gleamed
evilly
was
this
an
omen
a
sign
vouchsafed
of
that
which
dark
and
terrible
was
even
then
marching
to
meet
us
upon
this
broad
highway
o
blind
and
more
than
blind
almost
before
it
had
ceased
to
quiver
i
stooped
and
plucking
it
from
the
floor
gave
it
into
her
hand
now
as
i
did
so
her
fingers
touched
mine
and
moved
by
a
sudden
mad
impulse
i
stooped
and
pressed
my
lips
upon
them
kissed
them
quick
and
fierce
and
so
turned
and
hurried
upon
my
way
yet
as
i
went
i
found
that
the
knife
had
cut
my
chin
and
that
i
was
bleeding
o
blind
and
more
than
blind
surely
this
was
a
warning
an
omen
to
heed
to
shiver
over
despite
the
warm
sun
but
seeing
the
blood
i
laughed
and
strode
villagewards
blithe
of
heart
and
light
of
foot
o
blind
and
more
than
blind
chapter
xviii
in
which
i
hear
news
of
sir
maurice
vibart
which
i
says
lord
love
me
i
plunged
the
iron
back
into
the
fire
and
turning
my
head
espied
a
figure
standing
in
the
doorway
and
though
the
leather
hat
and
short
round
jacket
had
been
superseded
by
a
smart
groom
livery
i
recognized
the
postilion
so
me
bob
if
this
ai
a
piece
o
luck
he
exclaimed
and
with
the
words
he
removed
his
hat
and
fell
to
combing
his
short
thick
hair
with
the
handle
of
his
whip
i
glad
you
think
so
said
i
you
can
drownd
me
if
it
ai
said
he
and
pray
how
is
the
gentleman
who
happened
to
fall
and
hurt
himself
if
you
remember
in

storm

repeated
the
postilion
winking
knowingly
says
you

i
with
which
he
laid
his
forefinger
against
the
side
of
his
nose
and
winked
again

be
pleased
to
mean

then
where

difference
to
tell
which
is
the
lord
an
which
is
the
postilion
who
indeed
said
i
setting
down
my
hammer
jack
is
often
as
good
as
his
master
and
a
great
deal
better
why
nobody
nodded
the
postilion
not
a
soul
till
we
opened
our
mouths
an
then
be
easy
enough
for
my
lord
or
earl
or
gentleman
bein
naked
an
not
likin
it
which
would
only
be
would
fall
damning
everybody
cursin
everything
an
never
stop
to
think
while
i
not
bein
born
to
it
should
stand
there
an
tryin
a
curse
or
two
myself
maybe
but
lord
mine
would
amount
to
nothin
at
all
me
not
gifted
nor
yet
born
to
it
an
this
brings
me
round
to
her
ah
number
two
as
quarrelled
wi
number
one
all
the
way
from
london
as
run
away
from
number
one
wot
about
here
he
fell
to
combing
his
hair
again
with
his
while
his
quick
bright
eyes
dodged
from
my
face
to
the
glowing
forge
and
back
again
and
his
lips
pursed
themselves
in
a
soundless
whistle
and
as
i
watched
him
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
the
question
that
had
been
in
his
mind
all
along
seeing
she
did
manage
to
run
away
from
him
number
one
she
is
probably
very
well
i
answered
ah
to
be
sure
very
well
you
say
ah
to
be
sure
said
the
postilion
apparently
lost
in
contemplation
of
the
bellows
an
where
might
she
be
now
that
i
am
unable
to
tell
you
said
i
and
began
to
blow
up
the
fire
while
the
postilion
watched
me
sucking
the
handle
of
his
whip
reflectively
you
work
oncommon
drownd
me
if
you
do
pretty
hard
i
nodded
an
gets
well
paid
for
it
not
so
well
as
i
could
wish
said
i
not
so
well
as
could
wish
nodded
the
postilion
apparently
addressing
the
for
his
gaze
was
fixed
upon
it
of
course
not
the
a
man
works
the
wuss
gets
paid
much
did
you
say
you
got
a
week
i
named
no
sum
i
replied
well
much
might
you
be
gettin
a
week
ten
shillings
gets
ten
shillin
a
week
he
nodded
to
the
sledgehammer
that
much
for
a
chap
like
kick
me
if
it
is
yet
i
make
it
do
very
well
the
postilion
became
again
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
bellows
indeed
he
studied
them
so
intently
viewing
them
with
his
head
now
on
one
side
now
on
the
other
that
i
fell
to
watching
him
under
my
brows
and
so
presently
caught
him
furtively
watching
me
hereupon
he
drew
his
whip
from
his
mouth
and
spoke
supposing
said
he
and
stopped
well
i
inquired
and
leaning
upon
my
hammer
i
looked
him
square
in
the
eye
supposing
wot
are
you
at
my
feller
you
have
said
twice
well
well
said
he
fixing
his
eye
upon
the
bellows
again
supposing
you
was
to
make
a
guinea
over
an
above
your
wages
this
week
i
should
be
very
much
surprised
said
i
you
would
i
certainly
should
then
why
not
surprise
yourself
you
must
speak
more
plainly
said
i
well
then
said
the
postilion
still
with
his
gaze
abstracted
supposin
i
was
to
place
a
guinea
down
on
that
there
anvil

would
that
you
to
remember
where

two

i
then

i
shaking
my
head
what

two
pun
ten
i
do
well
let
say
three
pound
i
shook
my
head
and
drawing
the
iron
from
the
fire
began
to
hammer
at
it
well
then
shouted
the
postilion
for
i
was
making
as
much
din
as
possible
say
four
five
ten
fifteen
fifty
here
i
ceased
hammering

i
examining
the
horseshoe
ere
i
set
it
back
in
the
fire
sixty
guineas
said
the
postilion
gloomily

i

then
said
he
his
gloom
deepening
once
more

i
a
one

said
he
removing
his
hat
to
mop
at
his
brow
any
more
i
inquired

the
postilion
sulkily
putting
on
his
hat
i
done

he
set
the
figure
at
a
hundred
guineas
said
i

said
i

said
the
postilion
persuasively
think
it
over
now
let
me
fully
understand
you
then
said
i
you
propose
to
pay
me
one
hundred
guineas
on
behalf
of
your
master
known
heretofore
as
number
one
for
such
information
as
shall
enable
him
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
a
certain
person
known
as
her
number
two

that
how
the
matter
stands
ah
that

stands
nodded
the
postilion
the
money
to
be
yours
as
soon
as
ever
lays
on
is
it
a
go
no
no
no
you
must
be
stark
starin

a
fool
said
i
angrily
so
you
are
sweet
on
then
ass
said
i
fool
and
dropping
my
hammer
i
made
towards
him
but
he
darted
nimbly
to
the
door
where
seeing
i
did
not
pursue
he
paused
i
may
be
a
hass
he
nodded
an
i
may
be
a
fool
but
i
do
go
in
love
wi
ladies
as
is
above
me
an
out
o
my
reach
and
do
chuck
away
a
guineas
for
one
as
ai
likely
to
look
my
way
not
me
which
i
begs
leave
to
say
hass
yourself
an
likewise
fool
bah
with
which
expletive
he
set
his
thumb
to
his
nose
spread
out
his
fingers
wagged
them
and
swaggered
off
above
me
and
out
of
my
reach
one
not
likely
to
look
my
way
and
in
due
season
having
finished
the
horseshoe
having
set
each
tool
in
its
appointed
place
in
the
racks
and
raked
out
the
clinkers
from
the
fire
i
took
my
hat
and
coat
and
closing
the
door
behind
me
set
out
for
the
hollow
chapter
xix
how
i
met
black
george
again
and
wherein
the
patient
reader
shall
find
a
little
blood
it
was
evening
that
time
before
the
moon
is
up
and
when
the
earth
is
dark
as
yet
and
full
of
shadows
now
as
i
went
by
some
chance
there
recurred
to
me
the
words
of
an
old
song
i
had
read
somewhere
years
ago
words
written
in
the
glorious
brutal
knightly
days
of
edward
the
first
of
warlike
memory
and
the
words
ran
thus
for
her
love
i
carke
and
care
for
her
love
i
droop
and
dare
for
her
love
my
bliss
is
bare
and
i
wax
wan
i
wonder
what
poor
fool
wrote
that
said
i
aloud
for
her
love
in
sleep
i
slake
for
her
love
all
night
i
wake
for
her
love
i
mourning
make
more
than
any
man
some
doughty
or
perhaps
some
wandering
knight
probably
of
a
dark
unlovely
look
who
rode
the
forest
ways
with
his
thoughts
full
of
her
and
dreaming
of
her
loveliness
howbeit
he
was
beyond
all
doubt
a
fool
and
a
great
one
said
i
for
it
is
to
be
inferred
from
these
few
words
he
has
left
us
that
his
love
was
hopeless
she
was
perhaps
proud
and
of
a
high
estate
one
who
was
above
him
and
far
beyond
his
reach
who
was
not
likely
even
to
look
his
way
doubtless
she
was
beautiful
and
therefore
haughty
and
disdainful
for
disdainful
pride
is
an
attribute
of
beauty
and
ever
was
and
ever
will
be
and
hence
it
came
that
our
misfortunate
squire
or
was
scorned
for
his
pains
poor
fool
which
yet
was
his
own
fault
after
all
and
indeed
his
just
reward
for
what
has
any
or
lusty
knight
with
the
world
before
him
and
glory
yet
unachieved
to
do
with
love
love
is
a
bauble
a
toy
a
pretty
pastime
for
idle
folk
who
have
no
thought
above
such
away
with
it
bah
and
in
my
mind
that
is
to
say
mentally
i
set
my
thumb
to
my
nose
and
spread
my
fingers
and
wagged
them
even
as
the
postilion
had
done
and
yet
despite
this
the
words
of
the
old
song
recurred
again
and
again
pathetically
insistent
voicing
themselves
in
my
footsteps
so
that
to
banish
them
i
presently
stood
still
and
in
that
very
moment
a
gigantic
figure
came
bursting
through
the
hedge
clearing
the
ditch
in
a
single
bound
and
black
george
confronted
me
haggard
of
face
with
hair
and
beard
matted
and
unkempt
his
clothes
all
dusty
and
torn
he
presented
a
very
wild
and
terrible
appearance
and
beneath
one
arm
he
carried
two
bludgeons
the
pedler
had
spoken
truly
then
and
as
i
met
the
giant
smouldering
eye
i
felt
my
mouth
become
suddenly
parched
and
dry
and
the
palms
of
my
hands
grew
moist
and
clammy
for
a
moment
neither
of
us
spoke
only
we
looked
at
each
other
steadily
in
the
eye
and
i
saw
the
hair
of
his
beard
bristle
and
he
raised
one
great
hand
to
the
collar
of
his
shirt
and
tore
it
open
as
if
it
were
strangling
him
george
said
i
at
last
and
held
out
my
hand
george
never
stirred
wo
you
shake
hands
george
his
lips
opened
but
no
words
came
had
i
known
where
to
look
for
you
i
should
have
sought
you
out
days
ago
i
went
on
as
it
is
i
have
been
wishing
to
meet
you
hoping
to
set
matters
right
once
again
his
lips
opened
but
still
no
word
came
you
see
prudence
is
breaking
her
heart
over
you
a
laugh
burst
from
him
sudden
and
harsh
you
a
liar
said
he
and
his
voice
quavered
strangely
i
speak
gospel
truth
said
i
i
be
nowt
to
prue
since
the
day
you
beat
me
at
an
ye
know
it
prudence
loves
you
and
always
has
said
i
go
back
to
her

back
to
her
and
to
your
work
be
the
man
i
know
you
are
go
back
to
her
she
loves
you
if
you
still
doubt
my
word
here
read
that
and
i
held
out
his
own
letter
the
letter
on
which
prudence
had
written
those
four
words
george
i
love
you
he
took
it
from
me
crumpled
it
slowly
in
his
hand
and
tossed
it
into
the
ditch
you
a
liar
said
he
again
an
a
coward
and
you
said
i
you
are
a
fool
a
blind
gross
selfish
fool
who
in
degrading
yourself
in
skulking
about
the
woods
and
lanes
is
bringing
black
shame
and
sorrow
to
as
sweet
a
maid
as
ever
it
do
need
you
to
tell
me
what
she
be
an
what
she
bea
said
black
george
in
a
low
repressed
voice
i
knowed
long
afore
you
ever
set
eyes
on
grew
up
wi
i
did
an
i
bea
deaf
nor
blind
ye
see
i
loved
all
my
life
that
why
one
o
us
to
lie
out
all
night
ah
an
all
likewise
if
summun
do
chance
to
find
us
saying
which
he
forced
a
cudgel
into
my
hand
what
do
you
mean
george
i
means
as
if
you
do
do
for
me
then
i
be
to
do
for
but
why
i
cried
in
god

thick
but

for
but
i
tell
you

black
george
and
no
other
she
never
had
any
thought
of
me
or
i
of
her
this
is
madness
and
worse
and
i
tossed
the
cudgel
aside
an
i
tell
broke
in
the
smith
his
repression
giving
way
before
a
fury
as
fierce
as
it
was
sudden
i
tell
you
be
a
liar
an
a
coward
i
know
i

the
woman
as
loves
ye
an
the
woman
as
bore
ye
stand
up
i
say
or
by
god
i
do
for
and
he
raised
his
weapon
without
another
word
i
picked
up
the
cudgel
and
pointing
to
a
gate
a
little
farther
along
the
road
i
led
the
way
into
the
meadow
beyond
on
the
other
side
of
this
meadow
ran
the
lane
i
have
mentioned
before
and
beyond
the
lane
was
the
hollow
and
glancing
thitherward
i
bethought
me
that
supper
would
be
ready
and
charmian
waiting
for
me
just
about
now
and
i
sighed
i
remember
as
i
drew
off
my
coat
and
laid
it
together
with
my
hat
under
the
hedge
the
moon
was
beginning
to
rise
casting
the
magic
of
her
pale
loveliness
upon
the
world
and
as
i
rolled
up
my
sleeves
i
glanced
round
about
me
with
an
eye
that
strove
to
take
in
the
beauty
of
all
things
of
hedge
and
tree
and
winding
road
the
gloom
of
wood
the
sheen
of
water
and
the
far
soft
sweep
of
hill
and
dale
over
all
these
my
glance
lingered
yearningly
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
look
might
be
my
last
and
now
as
i
stooped
and
gripped
my
weapon
i
remembered
how
i
had
that
morning
kissed
her
fingers
and
i
was
strangely
comforted
and
glad
the
night
air
which
had
been
warm
heretofore
struck
chilly
now
and
as
i
stood
up
fronting
black
george
i
shivered
seeing
which
he
laughed
short
and
fierce
and
with
the
laugh
came
at
me
striking
downwards
at
my
head
as
he
came
and
tough
wood
met
tough
wood
with
a
shock
that
jarred
me
from
wrist
to
shoulder
to
hit
him
upon
the
arm
and
disable
him
was
my
one
thought
and
object
i
therefore
watched
for
an
opening
parrying
his
swift
strokes
and
avoiding
his
rushes
as
well
as
i
might
time
and
again
our
weapons
crashed
together
now
above
my
head
now
to
right
or
left
sometimes
rattling
in
quick
succession
sometimes
with
pauses
between
strokes
pauses
filled
in
with
the
sound
of
heavy
breathing
and
the
ceaseless
thud
of
feet
upon
the
sward
i
was
already
bruised
in
places
my
right
hand
and
arm
felt
numb
and
with
a
shooting
pain
in
the
shoulder
that
grew
more
acute
with
every
movement
my
breath
also
was
beginning
to
labor
yet
still
black
george
pressed
on
untiring
relentless
showering
blow
on
blow
while
my
arm
grew
ever
weaker
and
weaker
and
the
pain
in
my
shoulder
throbbed
more
intensely
how
long
had
we
fought
five
minutes
ten
an
hour
i
could
see
the
sweat
gleaming
upon
his
cheek
his
eyes
were
wild
his
mouth
gaped
open
and
he
drew
his
breath
in
great
sobbing
pants
but
as
i
looked
his
cudgel
broke
through
my
tired
guard
and
taking
me
full
upon
the
brow
drove
me
reeling
back
my
weapon
slipped
from
my
grasp
and
blinded
with
blood
i
staggered
to
and
fro
like
a
drunken
man
and
presently
slipped
to
the
grass
and
how
sweet
it
was
to
lie
thus
with
my
cheek
upon
kind
mother
earth
to
stretch
my
aching
body
and
with
my
weary
limbs
at
rest
but
black
george
stood
above
me
panting
and
as
his
eyes
met
mine
he
laughed
a
broken
laugh
and
whirled
up
his
cudgel
to
beat
out
my
brains
even
as
the
pedler
had
foretold
the
blackbird
would
sing
upon
my
motionless
breast
and
looking
into
black
george
eyes
i
smiled
get
up
he
panted
and
lowered
the
cudgel
get
up
or
by
god
do
for
sighing
i
rose
and
took
the
cudgel
he
held
out
to
me
wiping
the
blood
from
my
eyes
as
i
did
so
and
now
as
i
faced
him
once
more
all
things
vanished
from
my
ken
save
the
man
before
me
he
filled
the
universe
and
even
as
he
leaped
upon
me
i
leaped
upon
him
and
struck
with
all
my
strength
there
was
a
jarring
splintering
shock
and
black
george
was
beaten
down
upon
his
knees
but
as
dropping
my
weapon
i
stepped
forward
he
rose
and
stood
panting
and
staring
at
the
broken
cudgel
in
his
hand
george
said
i
you
peter
for
that
matter
so
are
you
be
good
for
a
man
sometimes
eases
un
it
does
i
panted
perhaps
you
are
willing
to
hear
reason
now
we
be
even
so
fur
but
fists
be
better
nor
sticks
any
day
an
i
be
goin
to
try
ye
wi
fists
have
we
not
bled
each
other
sufficiently
no
cried
george
between
set
teeth
theer
be
more
nor
you
an
me
i
said
as
one
on
us
would
lie
out
all
night
an
so
shall
by
god
come
on
fists
be
best
arter
all
this
was
the
heyday
of
boxing
and
while
at
oxford
i
had
earned
some
small
fame
at
the
sport
but
it
was
one
thing
to
spar
with
a
man
my
own
weight
in
a
padded
ring
with
limited
rounds
governed
by
a
code
of
rules
and
quite
another
to
fight
a
man
like
black
george
in
a
lonely
meadow
by
light
of
moon
moreover
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
science
as
i
could
see
from
the
way
he
shaped
the
only
difference
between
us
being
that
whereas
he
fought
with
feet
planted
square
and
wide
apart
i
balanced
myself
upon
my
toes
which
is
i
think
to
be
commended
as
being
quicker
and
more
calculated
to
lessen
the
impact
of
a
blow
brief
though
the
respite
had
been
it
had
served
me
to
recover
my
breath
and
though
my
head
yet
rung
from
the
and
the
blood
still
flowed
freely
getting
every
now
and
then
into
my
eyes
my
brain
was
clear
as
we
fronted
each
other
for
what
we
both
knew
must
be
the
decisive
bout
the
smith
stood
with
his
mighty
shoulders
stooped
something
forward
his
left
arm
drawn
back
his
right
flung
across
his
chest
and
so
long
as
we
fought
i
watched
that
great
fist
and
knotted
forearm
for
though
he
struck
oftener
with
his
left
it
was
in
that
passive
right
that
i
thought
my
danger
really
lay
it
is
not
my
intention
to
chronicle
this
fight
blow
by
blow
enough
and
more
than
enough
has
already
been
said
in
that
regard
suffice
it
then
that
as
the
fight
progressed
i
found
that
i
was
far
the
quicker
as
i
had
hoped
and
that
the
majority
of
his
blows
i
either
blocked
or
avoided
easily
enough
time
after
time
his
fist
shot
over
my
shoulder
or
over
my
head
and
time
after
time
i
countered
heavily
now
on
his
body
now
on
his
face
once
he
staggered
and
once
i
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
of
his
features
convulsed
with
pain
he
was
smeared
with
blood
from
the
waist
up
but
still
he
came
on
i
fought
desperately
now
savagely
taking
advantage
of
every
opening
for
though
i
struck
him
four
times
to
his
once
yet
his
blows
had
four
times
the
weight
of
mine
my
forearms
were
bruised
to
either
elbow
and
my
breath
came
in
gasps
and
always
i
watched
that
deadly
right
and
presently
it
came
with
arm
and
shoulder
and
body
behind
it
quick
as
a
flash
and
resistless
as
a
cannonball
but
i
was
ready
and
as
i
leaped
i
struck
and
struck
him
clean
and
true
upon
the
angle
of
the
jaw
and
spinning
round
black
george
fell
and
lay
with
his
arms
wide
stretched
and
face
buried
in
the
grass
slowly
slowly
he
got
upon
his
knees
and
thence
to
his
feet
and
so
stood
panting
hideous
with
blood
and
sweat
bruised
and
cut
and
disfigured
staring
at
me
as
one
in
amaze
now
as
i
looked
my
heart
went
out
to
him
and
i
reached
forth
my
right
hand
george
i
panted
oh
george
but
black
george
only
looked
at
me
and
shook
his
head
and
groaned
oh
peter
said
he
you
be
a
man
peter
i
ah
many
the
time
an
no
man
ever
knocked
me
down
afore
oh
peter
i
i
could
love
for
it
if
i
did
hate
the
very
sight
of
come
on
let
get
it
over
an
done
wi
so
once
again
fists
were
clenched
and
jaws
set
once
again
came
the
trampling
of
feet
the
hiss
of
breath
and
the
thudding
shock
of
blows
given
and
taken
a
sudden
jarring
impact
the
taste
of
sulphur
on
my
tongue
a
gathering
darkness
before
my
eyes
and
knowing
this
was
the
end
i
strove
desperately
to
close
with
him
but
i
was
dazed
blind
my
arms
fell
paralyzed
and
in
that
moment
the
smith
right
fist
drove
forward
a
jagged
flame
shot
up
to
heaven
the
earth
seemed
to
rush
up
towards
me
a
roaring
blackness
engulfed
me
and
then
silence
chapter
xx
how
i
came
up
out
of
the
dark
some
one
was
calling
to
me
a
long
way
off
some
one
was
leaning
down
from
a
great
height
to
call
to
me
in
the
depths
and
the
voice
was
wonderfully
sweet
but
faint
faint
because
the
height
was
so
very
high
and
the
depths
so
very
great
and
still
the
voice
called
and
called
and
i
felt
sorry
that
i
could
not
answer
because
as
i
say
the
voice
was
troubled
and
wonderfully
sweet
and
little
by
little
it
seemed
that
it
grew
nearer
this
voice
was
it
descending
to
me
in
these
depths
of
blackness
or
was
i
being
lifted
up
to
the
heights
where
i
knew
blackness
could
not
be
ay
indeed
i
was
being
lifted
for
i
could
feel
a
hand
upon
my
brow
a
smooth
cool
hand
that
touched
my
cheek
and
brushed
the
hair
from
my
forehead
a
strong
gentle
hand
it
was
with
soft
fingers
and
it
was
lifting
me
up
and
up
from
the
loathly
depths
which
seemed
more
black
and
more
horrible
the
farther
i
drew
from
them
and
so
i
heard
the
voice
nearer
and
ever
nearer
until
i
could
distinguish
words
and
the
voice
had
tears
in
it
and
the
words
were
very
tender
peter
speak
speak
to
me
peter
charmian
said
i
within
myself
why
truly
whose
hand
but
hers
could
have
lifted
me
out
of
that
gulf
of
death
back
to
light
and
life
yet
i
did
not
speak
aloud
for
i
had
no
mind
to
yet
a
while
ah
speak
to
me
speak
to
me
peter
how
can
you
lie
there
so
still
and
pale
and
now
her
arms
were
about
me
strong
and
protecting
and
my
head
was
drawn
down
upon
her
bosom
oh
peter
my
peter
nay
but
was
this
charmian
the
cold
proud
charmian
truly
i
had
never
heard
that
thrill
in
her
voice
before
could
this
indeed
be
charmian
and
lying
thus
with
my
head
on
this
sweet
pillow
i
could
hear
her
heart
whispering
to
me
and
it
seemed
that
it
was
striving
to
tell
me
something
striving
striving
to
tell
me
something
could
i
but
understand
ah
could
i
but
understand
i
waited
for
you
so
long
so
long
peter
and
the
supper
is
all
spoiled
a
rabbit
peter
you
liked
rabbit
and
and
oh
god
i
want
you
do
you
hear
me
peter
i
want
you
want
you
and
now
her
cheek
was
pressed
to
mine
and
her
lips
were
upon
my
hair
and
upon
my
brow
her
lips
was
this
indeed
charmian
and
was
i
peter
vibart
ah
if
i
could
but
know
what
it
was
her
heart
was
trying
to
tell
me
so
quickly
and
passionately
and
while
i
lay
listening
listening
something
hot
splashed
down
upon
my
cheek
and
then
another
and
another
her
bosom
heaved
tumultuously
and
instinctively
raising
my
arms
i
clasped
them
about
her
do
i
said
and
my
voice
was
a
whisper
do
charmian
for
a
moment
her
clasp
tightened
about
me
she
was
all
tenderness
and
clinging
warmth
then
i
heard
a
sudden
gasp
her
arms
loosened
and
fell
away
and
so
i
presently
raised
my
head
and
supporting
myself
upon
my
hand
looked
at
her
and
then
i
saw
that
her
cheeks
were
burning
peter
yes
charmian
did
you
she
paused
plucking
nervously
at
the
grass
and
looking
away
from
me
well
charmian
did
you
hear
again
she
broke
off
and
still
her
head
was
averted
i
heard
your
voice
calling
to
me
from
a
great
way
off
and
so
i
came
charmian
were
you
conscious
when
when
i
found
you
no
i
answered
i
was
lying
in
a
very
deep
black
pit
here
she
looked
at
me
again
i
i
thought
you
were
dead
peter
my
soul
was
out
of
my
body
until
you
recalled
it
you
were
lying
upon
your
back
by
the
hedge
here
and
oh
peter
your
face
was
white
and
shining
in
the
moonlight
and
there
was
blood
upon
it
and
you
looked
like
one
that
is
dead
and
she
shivered
and
you
have
brought
me
back
to
life
said
i
rising
but
being
upon
my
feet
i
staggered
giddily
to
hide
which
i
laughed
and
leaned
against
a
tree
indeed
said
i
i
am
very
much
alive
still
and
monstrously
hungry
you
spoke
of
a
rabbit
i
think
a
rabbit
said
charmian
in
a
whisper
and
as
i
met
her
eye
i
would
have
given
much
to
have
recalled
that
thoughtless
speech
i
i
think
you
did
mention
a
rabbit
said
i
floundering
deeper
so
then
you
deceived
me
you
lay
there
and
deceived
me
with
your
eyes
shut
and
your
ears
open
taking
advantage
of
my
pity
no
no
indeed
no
i
thought
myself
still
dreaming
it
it
all
seemed
so
unreal
so
so
beyond
all
belief
and
possibility
and
i
stopped
aghast
at
my
crass
folly
for
with
a
cry
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
while
i
stood
dumbfounded
like
the
fool
i
was
when
she
looked
up
her
eyes
seemed
to
scorch
me
and
i
thought
vibart
a
man
of
honor
like
a
knight
of
his
romances
high
and
chivalrous
oh
i
thought
him
a
gentleman
instead
of
which
said
i
speaking
as
it
were
despite
myself
instead
of
which
you
find
me
only
a
blacksmith
a
low
despicable
fellow
eager
to
take
advantage
of
your
unprotected
womanhood
she
did
not
speak
standing
tall
and
straight
her
head
thrown
back
wherefore
reading
her
scorn
of
me
in
her
eyes
seeing
the
proud
contempt
of
her
mouth
a
very
demon
seemed
suddenly
to
possess
me
for
certainly
the
laugh
that
rang
from
my
lip
proceeded
from
no
volition
of
mine
and
yet
madam
my
voice
went
on
this
despicable
blacksmith
fellow
refused
one
hundred
guineas
for
you
peter
she
cried
and
shrank
away
from
me
as
if
i
had
threatened
to
strike
her
ah
you
start
at
that
your
proud
lip
trembles
do
not
fear
madam
the
sum
did
not
tempt
him
though
a
large
one
peter
she
cried
again
and
now
there
was
a
note
of
appeal
in
her
voice
indeed
madam
even
so
degraded
a
fellow
as
this
blacksmith
could
not
very
well
sell
that
which
he
does
not
possess
could
he
and
so
the
hundred
guineas
go
and
you
are
still
unsold
long
before
i
had
done
she
had
covered
her
face
again
and
coming
near
i
saw
the
tears
running
out
between
her
fingers
and
sparkling
as
they
fell
and
once
again
the
devil
within
me
laughed
loud
and
harsh
but
while
it
still
echoed
i
had
flung
myself
down
at
her
feet
charmian
i
cried
forgive
me
you
will
you
must
and
kneeling
before
her
i
strove
to
catch
her
gown
and
kiss
its
hem
but
she
drew
it
close
about
her
and
turning
fled
from
me
through
the
shadows
heedless
of
all
else
but
that
she
was
leaving
me
i
stumbled
to
my
feet
and
followed
the
trees
seemed
to
beset
me
as
i
ran
and
bushes
to
reach
out
arms
to
stay
me
but
i
burst
from
them
running
wildly
blunderingly
for
she
was
going
charmian
was
leaving
me
and
so
spent
and
panting
i
reached
the
cottage
and
met
charmian
at
the
door
she
was
clad
in
the
long
cloak
she
had
worn
when
she
came
and
the
hood
was
drawn
close
about
her
face
i
stood
panting
in
the
doorway
barring
her
exit
let
me
pass
peter
by
god
no
i
cried
and
entering
closed
the
door
and
leaned
my
back
against
it
and
after
we
had
stood
thus
awhile
each
looking
upon
the
other
i
reached
out
my
hands
to
her
and
my
hands
were
torn
and
bloody
do
go
charmian
i
mumbled
do
go
oh
charmian
i
hurt
i
did
want
you
to
know
but
you
must
leave
me
i
am
not
well
it
is
my
head
i
think
i
met
black
george
and
he
was
too
strong
for
me
i
deaf
charmian
and
half
blinded
oh
do
leave
me
i
afraid
charmian
her
figure
grew
more
blurred
and
indistinct
and
i
sank
down
upon
my
knees
but
in
the
dimness
i
reached
out
and
found
her
hands
and
clasped
them
and
bowed
my
aching
head
upon
them
and
remained
thus
a
great
while
as
it
seemed
to
me
and
presently
through
the
mist
her
voice
reached
me
oh
peter
i
will
not
leave
you
lean
on
me
there
there
and
little
by
little
those
strong
gentle
hands
drew
me
up
once
more
to
light
and
life
and
so
she
got
me
to
a
chair
and
brought
cool
water
and
washed
the
blood
and
sweat
from
me
as
she
had
once
before
only
now
my
hurts
were
deeper
for
my
head
grew
beyond
my
strength
to
support
and
hung
upon
my
breast
and
my
brain
throbbed
with
fire
and
the
mist
was
ever
before
my
eyes
are
you
in
much
pain
peter
my
head
only
my
head
charmian
there
is
a
bell
ringing
there
no
it
is
a
hammer
beating
and
indeed
i
remembered
little
for
a
while
save
the
touch
of
her
hands
and
the
soothing
murmur
of
her
voice
until
i
found
she
was
kneeling
beside
me
feeding
me
with
broth
from
a
spoon
wherefore
i
presently
took
the
basin
from
her
and
emptied
it
at
a
gulp
and
finding
myself
greatly
revived
thereby
made
some
shift
to
eat
of
the
supper
she
set
before
me
so
she
presently
came
and
sat
beside
me
and
ate
also
watching
me
at
each
morsel
your
poor
hands
said
she
and
looking
down
at
them
i
saw
that
my
knuckles
were
torn
and
broken
and
the
fingers
much
swelled
and
yet
said
charmian
except
for
the
cut
in
your
head
you
are
quite
unmarked
peter
he
fought
mostly
for
the
body
i
answered
and
i
managed
to
keep
my
face
out
of
the
way
but
he
caught
me
twice
once
upon
the
chin
lightly
and
once
up
behind
the
ear
heavily
had
his
fist
landed
fairly
i
do
think
even
you
could
have
brought
me
back
from
those
loathly
depths
charmian
and
in
a
while
supper
being
done
she
brought
my
pipe
and
filled
it
and
held
the
light
for
me
but
my
head
throbbed
woefully
and
for
once
the
tobacco
was
flavorless
so
i
sighed
and
laid
the
pipe
by
why
peter
said
charmian
regarding
me
with
an
anxious
frown
you
smoke
not
just
now
charmian
said
i
and
leaning
my
head
in
my
hands
fell
into
a
sort
of
coma
till
feeling
her
touch
upon
my
shoulder
i
started
and
looked
up
you
must
go
to
bed
peter
no
said
i
yes
peter
very
well
charmian
yes
i
will
go
to
bed
and
i
rose
do
you
feel
better
now
peter
thank
you
yes
much
better
then
why
do
you
hold
on
to
the
chair
i
am
still
a
little
giddy
but
it
will
pass
and
charmian
you
forgive
yes
yes
do
do
look
at
me
like
that
peter
and
oh
good
night
foolish
boy
i
am
charmian
but
as
she
turned
away
i
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
dressed
as
i
was
i
lay
down
upon
my
bed
and
burying
my
head
in
the
pillow
groaned
for
my
pain
was
very
sore
indeed
i
was
to
feel
the
effects
of
george
fist
for
many
a
day
to
come
and
it
seems
to
me
now
that
much
of
the
morbid
imaginings
the
nightly
horrors
and
black
despair
that
i
endured
in
the
time
which
immediately
followed
was
chiefly
owing
to
that
terrible
blow
upon
the
head
chapter
xxi
of
the
opening
of
the
door
and
how
charmian
blew
out
the
light
he
bestrode
a
powerful
black
charger
and
his
armor
glittered
through
the
green
and
as
he
rode
beneath
the
leafy
arches
of
the
wood
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
sang
and
the
song
was
mournful
and
of
a
plaintive
seeming
and
rang
loud
behind
his
therefore
as
i
sat
beside
the
freshet
i
hearkened
to
his
song
for
her
love
i
carke
and
care
for
her
love
i
droop
and
dare
for
her
love
my
bliss
is
bare
and
i
wax
wan
forth
he
rode
from
the
shadowy
woodland
pacing
very
solemn
and
slow
and
thrice
he
struck
his
iron
hand
upon
his
iron
breast
for
her
love
in
sleep
i
slake
for
her
love
all
night
i
wake
for
her
love
i
mourning
make
more
than
any
man
now
being
come
to
where
i
sat
beside
the
brook
he
checked
his
horse
and
gazed
full
long
upon
me
and
his
eyes
shone
from
the
gloom
of
his
helmet
messire
quoth
be
how
like
you
my
song
but
little
sir
to
be
plain
with
you
not
a
whit
i
answered
and
beseech
you
wherefore
because
it
is
folly
away
with
it
for
if
your
head
be
full
of
such
how
shall
you
achieve
any
lasting
good
glory
learning
power
but
sighing
he
shook
his
head
quoth
he
o
blind
one
glory
is
but
a
name
learning
but
a
yearning
emptiness
and
whither
leadeth
ambition
man
is
a
mote
dancing
in
a
the
world
a
speck
hanging
in
space
all
things
vanish
and
pass
utterly
away
save
only
and
that
abideth
everlastingly
is
sweeter
than
life
and
stronger
than
death
and
reacheth
up
beyond
the
stars
and
thus
it
is
i
pray
you
tell
me
where
is
she
she
she
whom
ye
love
i
love
no
woman
said
i
liar
cried
he
in
a
terrible
voice
and
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
black
george
and
who
are
you
that
says
so
i
demanded
and
stood
upon
my
feet
look
behold
and
know
thyself
o
blind
and
more
than
blind
and
leaning
down
he
raised
his
visor
so
that
the
moonlight
fell
upon
his
face
and
the
face
i
looked
upon
was
my
own
and
while
i
gazed
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
cried
ye
spirits
of
the
wood
i
charge
ye
who
is
he
that
rideth
in
the
green
dreaming
ever
of
her
beauty
and
sighing
forth
his
love
everlastingly
spirits
of
the
wood
i
charge
ye
and
out
of
the
gloom
of
the
wood
from
every
rustling
leaf
and
opening
bud
came
a
little
voice
that
rose
and
blended
in
a
soft
hushed
chorus
crying
peter
vibart
peter
vibart
spirits
of
the
wood
i
charge
ye
who
is
he
that
walketh
to
and
fro
in
the
world
and
having
eyes
seeth
not
and
ears
heareth
not
a
very
fool
of
love
once
again
the
voices
cried
in
answer
peter
vibart
peter
vibart
spirits
of
the
wood
i
charge
ye
who
is
he
that
shall
love
with
a
love
mightier
than
most
who
shall
suffer
greatly
for
love
and
because
of
it
who
shall
think
of
it
by
day
and
dream
of
it
o
nights
who
is
he
that
must
die
to
find
love
and
the
fulness
of
life
o
spirits
of
the
wood
i
charge
ye
and
again
from
out
the
green
came
the
soft
hushed
chorus
peter
vibart
peter
vibart
but
even
as
i
laughed
came
one
from
the
wood
with
a
horse
and
armor
and
the
armor
he
girded
on
me
and
the
horse
i
mounted
and
there
in
the
moonlit
glade
we
fought
and
strove
together
my
other
self
and
i
and
sudden
and
strong
he
smote
me
so
that
i
fell
down
from
my
horse
and
lay
there
dead
with
my
blood
soaking
and
soaking
into
the
grass
and
as
i
watched
there
came
a
blackbird
that
perched
upon
my
breast
carolling
gloriously
yet
little
by
little
this
bird
changed
and
lo
in
its
place
was
a
new
peter
vibart
standing
upon
the
old
and
the
new
trampled
the
old
down
into
the
grass
and
it
was
gone
then
with
his
eyes
on
the
stars
the
new
peter
vibart
fell
and
the
words
i
sang
were
these
for
her
love
i
carke
and
care
for
her
love
i
droop
and
dare
for
her
love
my
bliss
is
bare
and
i
wax
wan
and
thus
there
came
into
my
heart
that
which
had
been
all
unknown
undreamed
of
hitherto
yet
which
once
there
could
never
pass
away
o
spirits
of
the
wood
i
charge
ye
who
is
he
that
counteth
sweeter
than
life
greater
than
wisdom
stronger
than
death
o
spirits
of
the
wood
i
charge
ye
and
the
hushed
voices
chorused
softly
peter
vibart
peter
vibart
and
while
i
listened
one
by
one
the
voices
ceased
till
there
but
one
remained
calling
calling
but
ever
soft
and
far
away
and
when
i
would
have
gone
toward
this
voice
lo
there
stood
a
knife
quivering
in
the
ground
before
me
that
grew
and
grew
until
its
haft
touched
heaven
yet
still
the
voice
called
upon
my
name
very
softly
peter
peter
oh
peter
i
want
you
oh
peter
wake
wake
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
as
i
listened
grew
suddenly
sick
and
a
fit
of
trembling
shook
me
violently
for
the
whisper
was
still
in
my
ears
and
in
the
whisper
was
an
agony
of
fear
and
dread
indescribable
peter
oh
peter
i
am
afraid
wake
wake
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
upon
me
and
i
glared
helplessly
towards
the
door
quick
peter
come
to
me
oh
god
i
strove
to
move
but
still
i
could
not
and
now
in
the
darkness
hands
were
shaking
me
wildly
and
charmian
voice
was
speaking
in
my
ear
the
door
it
whispered
the
door
then
i
arose
and
was
in
the
outer
room
with
charmian
close
beside
me
in
the
dark
and
my
eyes
were
upon
the
door
and
then
i
beheld
a
strange
thing
for
a
thin
line
of
white
light
traversed
the
floor
from
end
to
end
now
as
i
watched
this
narrow
line
i
saw
that
it
was
gradually
widening
and
widening
very
slowly
and
with
infinite
caution
the
door
was
being
opened
from
without
in
this
remote
place
in
this
still
dead
hour
of
the
night
full
of
the
ghostly
hush
that
ever
precedes
the
dawn
there
was
something
devilish
something
very
like
murder
in
its
stealthy
motion
i
heard
charmian
breath
catch
and
in
the
dark
her
hand
came
and
crept
into
mine
and
her
fingers
were
cold
as
death
and
now
a
great
anger
came
upon
me
and
i
took
a
quick
step
forward
but
charmian
restrained
me
no
peter
she
breathed
not
yet
wait
and
wound
her
arms
round
mine
in
a
corner
near
by
stood
that
same
trusty
staff
that
had
been
the
companion
of
my
wanderings
and
now
i
reached
and
took
it
up
balancing
it
in
my
hand
and
all
the
time
i
watched
that
line
of
light
upon
the
floor
widening
and
widening
growing
ever
broader
and
more
broad
the
minutes
dragged
slowly
by
while
the
line
grew
into
a
streak
and
the
streak
into
a
lane
and
upon
the
lane
came
a
blot
that
slowly
resolved
itself
into
the
shadow
of
a
hand
upon
the
latch
slowly
slowly
to
the
hand
came
a
wrist
and
to
the
wrist
an
arm
another
minute
and
this
maddening
suspense
would
be
over
despite
charmian
restraining
clasp
i
crept
a
long
pace
nearer
the
softly
moving
door
the
sharp
angle
of
the
elbow
was
growing
obtuse
as
the
shadowy
arm
straightened
itself
thirty
seconds
more
i
began
to
count
and
gripping
my
staff
braced
myself
for
what
might
be
when
with
a
sudden
cry
charmian
sprang
forward
and
hurling
herself
against
the
door
shut
it
with
a
crash
quick
peter
she
panted
i
was
beside
her
almost
as
she
spoke
and
had
my
hand
upon
the
latch
i
must
see
who
this
was
said
i
you
are
mad
she
cried
let
me
open
the
door
charmian
no
no
i
say
no
whoever
it
was
must
not
escape
open
the
door
never
never
i
tell
you
death
is
outside
there
murder
in
the
very
air
i
feel
it
and
dear
god
the
door
has
no
bolt
they
are
gone
now
whoever
they
were
said
i
reassuringly
the
danger
is
over
if
danger
it
could
be
called
danger
cried
charmian
i
tell
you
it
was
death
yet
after
all
it
may
have
been
only
some
homeless
wanderer
then
why
that
deadly
silent
caution
true
said
i
becoming
thoughtful
bring
the
table
peter
and
set
it
across
the
door
surely
the
table
is
too
light
to
but
it
will
give
sufficient
warning
not
that
i
shall
sleep
again
oh
peter
had
i
not
been
dreaming
and
happened
to
wake
had
i
not
chanced
to
look
towards
the
door
it
would
have
opened
wide
and
then
oh
horrible
you
were
dreaming
a
hateful
hateful
dream
and
awoke
in
terror
and
being
afraid
glanced
towards
the
door
and
saw
it
opening
and
now
bring
the
table
peter
now
groping
about
my
hand
encountered
one
of
the
candles
and
taking
out
my
all
unthinking
i
lighted
it
charmian
was
leaning
against
the
door
clad
in
a
flowing
white
garment
a
garment
that
was
wonderfully
stitched
all
dainty
frills
and
laces
with
here
and
there
a
bow
of
blue
riband
disposed
it
would
seem
by
the
hand
of
chance
and
yet
most
wonderfully
and
up
from
this
foam
of
laces
her
shoulders
rose
white
and
soft
and
dimpled
sweeping
up
in
noble
lines
to
the
smooth
round
column
of
her
throat
but
as
i
stared
at
all
this
loveliness
she
gave
a
sudden
gasp
and
stooped
her
head
and
crossed
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
while
up
over
the
snow
of
shoulder
over
neck
and
cheek
and
brow
ebbed
that
warm
crimson
tide
and
i
could
only
gaze
and
gaze
till
with
a
movement
swift
and
light
she
crossed
to
that
betraying
candle
and
stooping
blew
out
the
light
then
i
set
the
table
across
the
door
having
done
which
i
stood
looking
towards
where
she
yet
stood
charmian
said
i
yes
peter
yes
peter
i
will
make
a
bar
to
hold
the
door
yes
peter
two
bars
would
be
better
perhaps
yes
peter
you
would
feel
safe
then
safer
than
ever
safer
than
ever
peter
chapter
xxii
in
which
the
ancient
discourses
on
love
i
am
forging
a
bar
for
my
cottage
door
such
a
bar
as
might
give
check
to
an
army
or
resist
a
a
bar
that
shall
defy
all
the
that
ever
prowled
a
stout
solid
bar
broad
as
my
wrist
and
thick
as
my
two
fingers
that
looking
upon
it
as
it
lies
in
its
sockets
across
the
door
charmian
henceforth
may
sleep
and
have
no
fear
the
ancient
sat
perched
on
his
stool
in
the
corner
but
for
once
we
spoke
little
for
i
was
very
busy
also
my
mind
was
plunged
in
a
profound
reverie
and
of
whom
should
i
be
thinking
but
of
charmian
and
of
the
dimple
in
her
shoulder
is
bewitched
you
be
peter
said
the
old
man
suddenly
prodding
me
softly
with
his
stick
bewitched
as
ever
was
and
he
chuckled
bewitched
said
i
starting
ah

night

but

he
chuckled

ye
be
too

peter
hereupon
the
smithy
became
full
of
the
merry
din
of
my
hammer
and
while
i
worked
the
ancient
smoked
his
pipe
and
watched
me
informing
me
between
whiles
that
the
jersey
cow
was
in
calf
that
the
hops
seemed
more
than
usually
forward
and
that
he
had
waked
that
morning
with
a
touch
o
the
rheumatics
but
otherwise
he
was
unusually
silent
moreover
each
time
that
i
happened
to
glance
up
it
was
to
find
him
regarding
me
with
a
certain
fixity
of
eye
which
at
another
time
would
have
struck
me
as
portentous
ye
be
palish

the

some
soft
an

everywhere
i
answered
in
her
eyes
in
her
thick
soft
hair
the
warmth
of
her
breath
the
touch
of
her
hand
the
least
contact
of

garments

step

joyfully
peering
at
me
under
his
brows
i
knowed
it
knew
what
you

in
love
good
lad

lad
and
he
flourished
his
pipe
in
the
air
in

i
exclaimed
in

sure

but

according
to
aristotle
is

coward
when
she
stands
up
at
love

the
green
earth
greener

and
gave
two
loud
double
knocks
upon
the
lid

a

sooner
than
a

and
began

up

fire
peter

the
old
man
rose
and
hobbling
forward
tapped
me
upon
the
breast
with
the
handle
of
his
stick
then
who
was

of
a
while

an

the
old
man
shaking
his
head
i
wonders

arter

on
it
an
me
such
a
old
man
such
a
very
ancient
man
oh
peter

full
o
an
all
manner
o
contrariness
sometimes
i
wishes
as
i
never
took
the
trouble
to
find
ye
at
all
and
with
this
parthian
shot
the
old
man
sighed
and
turned
his
back
upon
me
and
tottered
out
of
the
forge
chapter
xxiii
how
gabbing
dick
the
pedler
set
a
hammer
going
in
my
head
having
finished
my
bars
with
four
strong
brackets
to
hold
them
i
put
away
my
tools
and
donned
hat
and
coat
it
was
yet
early
and
there
was
besides
much
work
waiting
to
be
done
but
i
felt
unwontedly
tired
and
out
of
sorts
wherefore
with
my
bars
and
brackets
beneath
my
arm
i
set
out
for
the
hollow
from
the
hedges
on
either
side
of
me
came
the
sweet
perfume
of
the
honeysuckle
and
beyond
the
hedges
the
fields
stood
high
with
ripening
corn
a
yellow
host
nodding
and
swaying
lazily
i
stood
awhile
to
listen
to
its
whisper
as
the
gentle
wind
swept
over
it
and
to
look
down
the
long
green
alleys
of
the
beyond
and
at
the
end
of
one
of
these
straight
arched
vistas
there
shone
a
solitary
great
star
and
presently
lifting
my
eyes
to
the
sky
already
deepening
to
evening
and
remembering
how
i
had
looked
round
me
ere
i
faced
black
george
i
breathed
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
that
i
was
yet
alive
with
strength
to
walk
within
a
world
so
beautiful
now
as
i
stood
thus
i
heard
a
voice
hailing
me
and
glancing
about
espied
one
some
distance
up
the
road
who
sat
beneath
the
hedge
whom
upon
approaching
i
recognized
as
gabbing
dick
the
pedler
he
nodded
and
grinned
as
i
came
up
but
in
both
there
was
a
vague
unpleasantness
as
also
in
the
manner
in
which
he
eyed
me
slowly
up
and
down
you
stood
up
into
the
sky
for
a
good
ten
minutes
said
he
and
what
if
i
have
nothin
said
the
pedler
nothin
at
all
though
if
the
moon
been
up
a
cove
might
ha
thought
as
you
was
dreamin
of
some
eve
or
other
folk
always
stares
at
the
moon
leastways
so
they
tell
me
any
one
as
stares
at
the
moon
when
might
be
doin
better
is
a
fool
as
great
a
fool
as
any
man
as
stares
at
a
eve
for
a
eve
never
brought
any
man
nothin
but
trouble
and
sorrer
and
never
will
do
frown
young
cove
nor
shake
your
for
it
true
caused
more
sorrer
an
blood
than
them
eves
blood
ah
rivers
of
it
oceans
of
good
blood
been
spilt
all
along
o
women
from
the
eve
as
tricked
old
adam
to
the
eve
as
tricks
the
like
o
me
or
say
yourself
here
he
regarded
me
with
so
evil
a
leer
that
i
turned
my
back
in
disgust
do
go
young
cove
i
ai
done
yet
and
i
got
to
tell
ye
then
tell
it
said
i
stopping
again
struck
by
the
fellow
manner
and
tell
it
quickly
i
to
it
as
fast
as
i
can
ai
i
very
well
then
a
fine
young
cove
and
may
white
which
i
see
myself
but
no
matter
and
may
likewise
be
o
taking
ways
which
though
not
noticin
i
wo
go
for
to
deny
but
a
a
eve
and
always
will
be
you
mind
as
i
warned
you
again
last
time
i
see
ye
very
well
then
well
said
i
impatiently
well
nodded
the
pedler
and
his
eyes
twinkled
malevolently
i
says
it
again
i
warns
you
again
you
a
nice
young
cove
and
quiet
though
i
do
like
the
cock
o
your
eye
and
mind
i
do
bear
you
no
though
you
did
turn
me
from
your
door
on
a
cold
dark
night
it
was
neither
a
cold
nor
a
dark
night
said
i
well
it
might
ha
been
might
it
very
well
then
still
i
do
said
the
pedler
spitting
dejectedly
into
the
ditch
i
bear
you
no
feelin
for
it
me
always
makin
it
a
pint
to
forgive
them
as
woefully
oppresses
me
likewise
them
as
despitefully
uses
me
it
might
ha
been
cold
and
dark
wi
ice
and
snow
and
i
might
ha
froze
to
death
but
we
wo
say
no
more
about
it
you
said
pretty
well
i
think
said
i
supposing
you
tell
me
what
you
have
to
tell
me
otherwise
good
night
very
well
then
said
the
pedler
let
talk
o
else
still
livin
in
the
i
suppose
yes
ah
well
i
come
through
there
today
said
he
grinning
and
again
his
eyes
grew
malevolent
indeed
ah
indeed
i
come
through
this
very
arternoon
and
uncommon
pretty
everythin
was
lookin
wi
the
grass
so
green
and
the
trees
so
so
shady
shady
the
word
nodded
the
pedler
glancing
up
at
me
through
his
narrowed
eyelids
and
chuckling
a
paradise
you
might
call
it
ah
a
paradise
or
a
garden
of
eden
wi
eve
and
the
serpent
and
all
and
he
broke
out
into
a
cackling
laugh
and
in
the
look
and
the
laugh
indeed
about
his
whole
figure
there
was
something
so
repellent
so
evil
that
i
was
minded
to
kick
and
trample
him
down
into
the
ditch
yet
the
leering
triumph
in
his
eyes
held
me
yes
said
i
ye
see
bein
by
i
to
pass
the
cottage
and
very
pretty
that
looked
too
and
nice
and
neat
inside
yes
said
i
and
bein
so
near
i
to
glance
in
at
the
winder
and
there
sure
enough
i
see
as
you
might
say
eve
in
the
gardin
and
a
fine
figure
of
a
eve
she
be
and
wi
it
ai
often
as
you
see
a
maid
the
likes
o
so
proud
and
like
well
well
just
as
i
to
look
in
at
the
winder
she
to
be
standin
wi
an
open
book
in
a
old
leather
book
wi
a
broken
cover
yes
said
i
and
she
was
and
a
pretty
soft
eve
laugh
it
were
too
yes
said
i
and
were
at
the
shoulder
the
irons
slipped
from
my
grasp
and
fell
with
a
harsh
clang
ketches
ye
does
it
said
the
pedler
i
did
not
speak
but
meeting
my
eye
he
scrambled
hastily
to
his
feet
and
catching
up
his
pack
retreated
some
little
way
down
the
road
ketches
ye
does
it
my
cove
he
repeated
turn
me
away
from
your
door
on
a
cold
dark
night
would
ye
not
as
i
bears
you
any
for
it
bein
of
a
forgivin
natur
but
i
says
to
you
i
says
look
out
a
fine
lass
she
be
wi
soft
eyes
and
red
lips
and
long
white
arms
the
eyes
and
lips
and
arms
of
a
eve
and
eve
tricked
adam
did
she
and
you
ai
a
better
man
nor
adam
are
ye
very
well
then
saying
which
he
spat
once
more
into
the
ditch
and
shouldering
his
pack
strode
away
and
after
some
while
i
took
up
my
iron
bars
and
trudged
on
towards
the
cottage
as
i
went
i
repeated
to
myself
over
and
over
again
the
word
liar
yet
my
step
was
very
slow
and
heavy
and
my
feet
dragged
in
the
dust
and
somewhere
in
my
head
a
small
hammer
had
begun
to
beat
soft
and
slow
and
regular
but
beating
beating
upon
my
brain
now
the
upper
cover
of
my
virgil
book
was
broken
chapter
xxiv
the
virgil
book
a
man
was
leaning
in
the
shadow
of
a
tree
looking
down
into
the
hollow
i
could
not
see
him
very
distinctly
because
though
evening
had
scarcely
fallen
the
shadows
where
he
stood
were
very
dense
but
he
was
gazing
down
into
the
hollow
in
the
attitude
of
one
who
waits
for
what
for
whom
a
sudden
fit
of
shivering
shook
me
from
head
to
foot
and
while
i
yet
shivered
i
grew
burning
hot
the
blood
throbbed
at
my
temples
the
small
hammer
was
drumming
much
faster
now
and
the
cool
night
air
seemed
to
be
stifling
me
very
cautiously
i
began
creeping
nearer
the
passive
figure
while
the
hammer
beat
so
loud
that
it
seemed
he
must
hear
it
where
he
stood
a
shortish
figure
clad
in
a
blue
coat
he
held
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
he
leaned
carelessly
against
the
tree
and
his
easy
assurance
of
air
maddened
me
the
more
as
he
stood
thus
looking
always
down
into
the
hollow
his
neck
gleamed
at
me
above
the
collar
of
his
coat
wherefore
i
stooped
and
laying
my
irons
in
the
grass
crept
on
once
more
and
as
i
went
i
kept
my
eyes
upon
his
neck
a
stick
snapped
sharp
and
loud
beneath
my
tread
the
lounging
back
stiffened
and
grew
rigid
the
face
showed
for
an
instant
over
the
shoulder
and
with
a
spring
he
had
vanished
into
the
bushes
it
was
a
vain
hope
to
find
a
man
in
such
a
dense
tangle
of
boughs
and
underbrush
yet
i
ran
forward
nevertheless
but
though
i
sought
eagerly
upon
all
sides
he
had
made
good
his
escape
so
after
a
while
i
retraced
my
steps
to
where
i
had
left
my
irons
and
brackets
and
taking
them
up
turned
aside
to
that
precipitous
path
which
as
i
have
already
said
leads
down
into
the
hollow
now
as
i
went
listening
to
the
throb
of
the
hammer
in
my
head
whom
should
i
meet
but
charmian
coming
gayly
through
the
green
and
singing
as
she
came
at
sight
of
me
she
stopped
and
the
song
died
upon
her
lip
why
why
peter
you
look
pale
dreadfully
pale
thank
you
i
am
very
well
said
i
you
have
not
been
fighting
again
why
should
i
have
been
fighting
charmian
your
eyes
are
wild
and
fierce
peter
were
you
coming
to
to
meet
me
charmian
yes
peter
now
watching
beneath
my
brows
it
almost
seemed
that
her
color
had
changed
and
that
her
eyes
of
set
purpose
avoided
mine
could
it
be
that
she
was
equivocating
but
i
am
much
before
my
usual
time
charmian
then
there
will
be
no
waiting
for
supper
and
i
am
ravenous
peter
and
as
she
led
the
way
along
the
path
she
began
to
sing
again
being
come
to
the
cottage
i
set
down
my
bars
and
brackets
with
a
clang
these
said
i
in
answer
to
her
look
are
the
bars
i
promised
to
make
for
the
door
do
you
always
keep
your
promises
peter
i
hope
so
then
said
she
coming
to
look
at
the
great
bars
with
a
fork
in
her
hand
for
she
was
in
the
middle
of
dishing
up
then
if
you
promise
me
always
to
come
home
by
the
road
and
never
through
the
coppice
you
will
do
so
wo
you
why
should
i
i
inquired
turning
sharply
to
look
at
her
because
the
coppice
is
so
dark
and
lonely
and
if
i
say
if
i
should
take
it
into
my
head
to
come
and
meet
you
sometimes
there
would
be
no
chance
of
my
missing
you
and
so
she
looked
at
me
and
smiled
and
going
back
to
her
cooking
fell
once
more
the
while
i
sat
and
watched
her
beneath
my
brows
surely
surely
no
woman
whose
heart
was
full
of
deceit
could
sing
so
blithely
and
happily
or
look
at
one
with
such
sweet
candor
in
her
eyes
and
yet
the
supper
was
a
very
ghost
of
a
meal
for
when
i
remembered
the
man
who
had
watched
and
waited
the
very
food
grew
nauseous
and
seemed
to
choke
me
she
a
eve
a
eve
rang
a
voice
in
my
ear
eve
tricked
adam
did
she
and
you
ai
a
better
man
nor
adam
she
a
eve
a
eve
peter
you
eat
nothing
yes
indeed
said
i
staring
unseeingly
down
at
my
plate
and
striving
to
close
my
ears
against
the
fiendish
voice
and
you
are
very
pale
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
peter
look
at
me
i
looked
up
obediently
yes
you
are
frightfully
pale
are
you
ill
again
is
it
your
head
peter
what
is
it
and
with
a
sudden
gesture
she
stretched
her
hand
to
me
across
the
table
and
as
i
looked
from
the
mute
pity
of
her
eyes
to
the
mute
pity
of
that
comforting
hand
i
had
a
great
impulse
to
clasp
it
close
in
mine
to
speak
and
tell
her
all
my
base
and
unworthy
suspicions
and
once
more
to
entreat
her
pardon
and
forgiveness
the
words
were
upon
my
lips
but
i
checked
them
madman
that
i
was
and
shook
my
head
it
is
nothing
i
answered
unless
it
be
that
i
have
not
yet
recovered
from
black
george
fist
it
is
nothing
and
so
the
meal
drew
to
an
end
and
though
feeling
my
thoughts
base
i
sat
with
my
head
on
my
hand
and
my
eyes
upon
the
cloth
yet
i
knew
she
watched
me
and
more
than
once
i
heard
her
sigh
a
man
who
acts
on
impulse
may
sometimes
be
laughed
at
for
his
mistakes
but
he
will
frequently
attain
to
higher
things
and
be
much
better
loved
by
his
fellows
than
the
colder
more
calculating
logician
who
rarely
makes
a
blunder
and
simon
peter
was
a
man
of
impulse
supper
being
over
and
done
charmian
must
needs
take
my
coat
despite
my
protests
and
fall
to
work
upon
its
threadbare
shabbiness
mending
a
great
rent
in
the
sleeve
and
watching
her
through
the
smoke
of
my
pipe
noting
the
high
mould
of
her
features
the
proud
poise
of
her
head
the
slender
elegance
of
her
hands
i
was
struck
sharply
by
her
contrast
to
the
rough
bare
walls
that
were
my
home
and
the
unlovely
garment
beneath
her
fingers
as
i
looked
she
seemed
to
be
suddenly
removed
from
me
far
above
and
beyond
my
reach
that
is
the
fourth
time
peter
what
charmian
that
is
the
fourth
time
you
have
sighed
since
you
lighted
your
pipe
and
it
is
out
and
you
never
noticed
it
yes
said
i
and
laid
the
pipe
upon
the
table
and
sighed
again
before
i
could
stop
myself
charmian
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
me
with
a
laugh
in
her
eyes
oh
most
philosophical
dreamy
blacksmith
where
be
your
thoughts
i
was
thinking
how
old
and
worn
and
disreputable
my
coat
looked
indeed
sir
said
charmian
holding
it
up
and
regarding
it
with
a
little
frown
forsooth
it
is
ancient
and
hath
seen
better
days
like
its
wearer
said
i
and
sighed
again
hark
to
this
ancient
man
she
laughed
this
blacksmith
of
ours
who
sighs
and
forever
sighs
if
it
could
possibly
be
that
he
had
met
any
one
sufficiently
worthy
i
should
think
that
he
had
fallen
philosophically
in
love
how
think
you
sir
knight
of
the
rueful
countenance
i
remember
said
i
that
among
other
things
you
once
called
me
mr
smith
charmian
laughed
and
nodded
her
head
at
me
you
had
been
describing
to
me
some
quite
impossible
idealistic
creature
alone
worthy
of
your
regard
sir
do
you
still
think
me
charmian
do
you
still
dream
of
your
impalpable
ideals
sir
no
i
answered
no
i
think
i
have
done
with
dreaming
and
i
have
done
with
this
thy
coat
for
behold
it
is
finished
and
rising
she
folded
it
over
the
back
of
my
chair
now
as
she
stood
thus
behind
me
her
hand
fell
and
for
a
moment
rested
lightly
upon
my
shoulder
peter
yes
charmian
i
wish
yes
i
do
wish
that
you
were
either
much
younger
or
very
much
older
why
because
you
would
be
quite
so
so
cryptic
such
a
very
abstruse
problem
sometimes
i
think
i
understand
you
better
than
you
do
yourself
and
sometimes
i
am
utterly
lost
now
if
you
were
younger
i
could
read
you
easily
for
myself
and
if
you
were
older
you
would
read
yourself
for
me
i
was
never
very
young
said
i
no
you
were
always
too
repressed
peter
yes
perhaps
i
was
repression
is
good
up
to
a
certain
point
but
beyond
that
it
is
dangerous
said
she
with
a
portentous
shake
of
the
head
heigho
was
it
a
week
or
a
year
ago
that
you
avowed
yourself
happy
and
tell
why
i
was
the
greater
fool
said
i
for
not
knowing
why
peter
for
thinking
myself
happy
peter
what
is
happiness
an
idea
said
i
possessed
generally
of
fools
and
what
is
misery
misery
is
also
an
idea
possessed
only
by
the
wise
peter
surely
he
is
wiser
who
chooses
happiness
neither
happiness
nor
misery
comes
from
choice
but
if
one
seeks
happiness
peter
one
will
assuredly
find
misery
said
i
and
sighing
rose
and
taking
my
hammer
from
its
place
above
my
bookshelf
set
to
work
upon
my
brackets
driving
them
deep
into
the
heavy
framework
of
the
door
all
at
once
i
stopped
with
my
hammer
poised
and
for
no
reason
in
the
world
looked
back
at
charmian
over
my
shoulder
looked
to
find
her
watching
me
with
eyes
that
were
if
it
could
well
be
puzzled
wistful
shy
and
glad
at
one
and
the
same
time
eyes
that
veiled
themselves
swiftly
before
my
look
yet
that
shot
one
last
glance
between
their
lashes
in
which
were
only
joy
and
laughter
yes
said
i
answering
the
look
but
she
only
stooped
her
head
and
went
on
sewing
yet
the
color
was
bright
in
her
cheeks
and
having
driven
in
the
four
brackets
or
staples
and
closed
the
door
i
took
up
the
bars
and
showed
her
how
they
were
to
lie
crosswise
across
the
door
resting
in
the
brackets
we
shall
be
safe
now
peter
said
she
those
bars
would
resist
an
elephant
i
think
they
would
i
nodded
but
there
is
yet
something
more
going
to
my
shelf
of
books
i
took
thence
the
pistol
she
had
brought
with
her
and
balanced
it
in
my
hand
i
will
take
this
to
cranbrook
and
buy
bullets
to
fit
it
why
there
are
bullets
there
in
one
of
the
old
shoes
peter
they
are
too
large
this
is
an
unusually
small
calibre
and
yet
it
would
be
deadly
enough
at
close
range
i
will
load
it
for
you
charmian
and
give
it
into
your
keeping
in
case
you
should
ever
grow
afraid
again
when
i
am
not
by
this
is
a
lonely
place
for
a
woman
at
all
times
yes
peter
she
was
busily
employed
upon
a
piece
of
embroidery
and
began
to
sing
softly
to
herself
again
as
she
worked
that
old
song
which
worthy
pepys
mentions
having
heard
from
the
lips
of
nell
gwynn
in
scarlet
town
where
i
was
born
there
was
a
fair
maid
dwellin
made
every
youth
cry
her
name
was
barbara
allen
are
you
so
happy
charmian
oh
sir
indifferent
well
i
thank
you
in
the
merry
month
of
may
when
green
buds
they
were
swellin
young
jemmy
grove
on
his
lay
for
love
of
barbara
allen
are
you
so
miserable
peter
why
do
you
ask
because
you
sigh
and
sigh
like
poor
jemmy
grove
in
the
song
he
was
a
fool
said
i
for
sighing
peter
for
dying
i
suppose
no
philosopher
could
ever
be
so
foolish
peter
no
said
i
certainly
not
it
is
well
to
be
a
philosopher
is
it
peter
hum
said
i
and
once
more
set
about
lighting
my
pipe
anon
i
rose
and
crossing
to
the
open
door
looked
out
upon
the
summer
night
and
sighed
and
coming
back
sat
watching
charmian
busy
fingers
charmian
said
i
at
last
yes
peter
do
you
ever
see
any
any
men
lurking
about
the
hollow
when
i
am
away
her
needle
stopped
suddenly
and
she
did
not
look
up
as
she
answered
no
peter
never
are
you
sure
charmian
the
needle
began
to
fly
to
and
fro
again
but
still
she
did
not
look
up
no
of
course
not
how
should
i
see
any
one
i
scarcely
go
beyond
the
hollow
and
i
busy
all
day
a
eve
a
eve
said
a
voice
in
my
ear
eve
tricked
adam
she
a
eve
after
this
i
sat
for
a
long
time
without
moving
my
mind
harassed
with
doubts
and
a
hideous
morbid
dread
why
had
she
avoided
my
eye
her
own
were
pure
and
truthful
and
could
not
lie
why
why
had
they
avoided
mine
if
only
she
had
looked
at
me
presently
i
rose
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
you
are
very
restless
peter
yes
said
i
yes
i
fear
i
am
you
must
pardon
me
why
not
read
indeed
i
had
not
thought
of
my
books
then
read
me
something
aloud
peter
i
will
read
you
the
sorrow
of
achilles
for
the
loss
of
briseis
said
i
and
going
into
the
corner
i
raised
my
hand
to
my
shelf
of
books
and
stood
there
with
hand
upraised
yet
touching
no
book
for
a
sudden
spasm
seemed
to
have
me
in
its
clutches
and
once
again
the
trembling
seized
me
and
the
hammer
had
recommenced
its
beat
beating
upon
my
brain
and
in
a
while
i
turned
from
my
books
and
crossing
to
the
door
leaned
there
with
my
back
to
her
lest
she
should
see
my
face
just
then
i
i
do
think
i
will
read
said
i
at
last
very
well
peter
let
us
talk
or
talk
said
i
i
i
think
i
go
to
bed
pray
i
went
on
hurriedly
for
i
was
conscious
that
she
had
raised
her
head
and
was
looking
at
me
in
some
surprise
pray
excuse
me
i
very
tired
so
while
she
yet
stared
at
me
i
turned
away
and
mumbling
a
good
night
went
into
my
chamber
and
closing
the
door
leaned
against
it
for
my
mind
was
sick
with
dread
and
sorrow
and
a
great
anguish
for
now
i
knew
that
charmian
had
lied
to
me
my
virgil
book
had
been
moved
from
its
usual
place
chapter
xxv
in
which
the
reader
shall
find
little
to
do
with
the
story
and
may
therefore
skip
is
there
anywhere
in
the
world
so
damnable
a
place
of
torment
as
a
bed
to
lie
awake
through
the
slow
dragging
hours
surrounded
by
a
sombre
quietude
from
whose
stifling
blackness
thoughts
like
demons
leap
to
catch
us
by
the
throat
or
like
waves
come
rolling
in
upon
us
ceaselessly
remorselessly
burying
us
beneath
their
resistless
flow
catching
us
up
whirling
us
dizzily
aloft
dashing
us
down
into
depths
infinite
now
retreating
now
advancing
from
whose
oncoming
terror
there
is
no
escape
until
we
are
once
more
buried
beneath
their
stifling
rush
to
lie
awake
staring
into
a
crowding
darkness
wherein
move
terrors
unimagined
to
bury
our
throbbing
temples
in
pillows
of
fire
to
roll
and
toss
until
the
soul
within
us
cries
out
in
agony
and
we
reach
out
frantic
hands
into
a
void
that
mocks
us
by
the
contrast
of
its
deep
and
awful
quiet
at
such
times
fair
reason
runs
affrighted
to
hide
herself
and
foaming
madness
fills
her
throne
at
such
times
our
everyday
sorrows
howsoever
small
and
petty
they
be
grow
and
magnify
themselves
until
they
overflow
the
night
filling
the
universe
above
and
around
us
and
of
all
the
woes
the
human
mind
can
bear
surely
suspicion
gnaws
deeper
than
them
all
so
i
lay
beneath
the
incubus
my
temples
clasped
tight
between
my
burning
palms
to
stay
the
maddening
ring
of
the
hammer
in
my
brain
and
suspicion
grew
into
certainty
and
with
certainty
came
madness
imagination
ran
riot
she
was
a
messalina
a
julia
a
joan
of
naples
a
veritable
succuba
a
thing
polluted
degraded
and
abominable
and
because
of
her
beauty
i
cursed
all
beautiful
things
and
because
of
her
womanhood
i
cursed
all
women
and
ever
the
hammer
beat
upon
my
brain
and
foul
shapes
danced
before
my
eyes
shapes
so
insanely
hideous
and
revolting
that
of
a
sudden
i
rose
from
my
bed
groaning
and
coming
to
the
casement
leaned
out
oh
the
cool
sweet
purity
of
the
night
i
heard
the
soft
stir
and
rustle
of
leaves
all
about
me
and
down
from
heaven
came
a
breath
of
wind
and
in
the
wind
a
great
raindrop
that
touched
my
burning
brow
like
the
finger
of
god
and
leaning
there
with
parted
lips
and
closed
eyes
gradually
my
madness
left
me
and
the
throbbing
in
my
brain
grew
less
how
many
poor
mortals
since
the
world
began
sleepless
and
even
as
i
have
looked
up
into
that
sky
and
sorrowed
for
the
dawn
for
her
love
in
sleep
i
slake
for
her
love
all
night
i
wake
for
her
love
i
mourning
make
more
than
any
man
poor
fool
to
think
that
thou
couldst
mourn
more
than
thy
kind
but
a
little
handful
of
gray
dust
ages
since
thy
name
and
estate
long
out
of
mind
thou
art
thou
shouldst
have
got
you
wisdom
by
now
perchance
poor
fool
that
thou
must
love
a
woman
and
worship
with
thy
love
building
for
her
an
altar
in
thine
heart
if
altar
crumble
and
heart
burst
is
she
to
blame
who
is
but
woman
or
thou
who
wouldst
have
made
her
all
divine
well
dead
a
small
handful
of
gray
dust
long
since
perchance
thou
hast
got
thee
wisdom
ere
now
poor
fool
o
fool
divine
as
thou
art
now
thy
sleepless
nights
forgot
the
carking
sorrows
of
thy
life
all
overpast
and
done
so
must
i
some
time
be
and
ages
hence
shall
smile
at
this
and
reckon
it
no
more
than
a
broken
toy
heigho
and
so
i
presently
turned
back
to
my
tumbled
bed
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
torment
and
terror
still
waited
me
there
moreover
i
was
filled
with
a
great
desire
for
action
this
narrow
chamber
stifled
me
while
outside
was
the
stir
of
leaves
the
gentle
breathing
of
the
wind
the
cool
murmur
of
the
brook
with
night
brooding
over
all
deep
and
soft
and
still
being
now
dressed
i
stood
awhile
deliberating
how
i
might
escape
without
disturbing
her
who
slumbered
in
the
outer
room
so
i
came
to
the
window
and
thrusting
my
head
and
shoulders
sidewise
through
the
narrow
lattice
slowly
and
with
much
ado
wriggled
myself
out
rising
from
my
hands
and
knees
i
stood
up
and
threw
wide
my
arms
to
the
perfumed
night
inhaling
its
sweetness
in
great
deep
breaths
and
so
turned
my
steps
towards
the
brook
drawn
thither
by
its
rippling
melody
for
a
brook
is
a
companionable
thing
at
all
times
to
a
lonely
man
and
very
full
of
wise
counsel
and
friendly
admonitions
if
he
but
have
ears
to
hear
withal
thus
as
i
walked
beside
the
brook
it
spoke
to
me
of
many
things
grave
and
gay
delivering
itself
of
observations
upon
the
folly
of
humans
comparing
us
very
unfavorably
with
the
godlike
dignity
of
trees
the
immutability
of
mountains
and
the
profound
philosophy
of
brooks
indeed
it
waxed
most
eloquent
upon
this
theme
caustic
if
you
will
but
with
a
ripple
between
whiles
like
the
chuckle
of
the
wise
old
philosopher
it
was
go
to

brook
oh
human
go
to
it
is
written
that
man
was
given
dominion
over
birds
and
beasts
and
fishes
and
all
things
made
yet
how
doth
man
in
all
his
pride
compare
with
even
a
little
mountain
and
as
to
birds
and
beasts
and
fishes
they
provide
for
themselves

go
to
chapter
xxvi
of
storm
and
tempest
and
how
i
met
one
praying
in
the
dawn
on
i
went
chin
on
breast
heedless
of
all
direction
now
beneath
the
shade
of
trees
now
crossing
grassy
glades
or
rolling
meadow
or
threading
my
way
through
long
alleys
of
on
and
on
skirting
hedges
by
haycocks
looming
ghostly
in
the
dark
by
rustling
cornfields
through
wood
and
coppice
where
branches
touched
me
as
i
passed
like
ghostly
fingers
in
the
dark
on
i
went
lost
to
all
things
but
my
own
thoughts
and
my
thoughts
were
not
of
life
nor
death
nor
the
world
nor
the
spaces
beyond
the
world
but
of
my
virgil
book
with
the
broken
cover
and
of
him
who
had
looked
at
it
over
her
shoulder
and
raising
my
hands
i
clasped
them
about
my
temples
and
leaning
against
a
tree
stood
there
a
great
while
yet
when
the
trembling
fit
had
left
me
i
went
on
again
and
with
every
footstep
there
rose
a
voice
within
me
crying
why
why
why
why
should
i
peter
vibart
hale
and
well
in
body
healthy
in
mind
why
should
i
fall
thus
into
because
of
a
woman
of
whom
i
knew
nothing
who
had
come
i
knew
not
whence
accompanied
by
one
whose
presence
under
such
conditions
meant
infamy
to
any
woman
why
should
i
burn
thus
in
a
fever
if
she
chose
to
meet
another
while
i
was
abroad
was
she
not
free
to
follow
her
own
devices
had
i
any
claim
upon
her
by
what
right
did
i
seek
to
compass
her
goings
and
comings
or
interest
myself
in
her
doings
why
why
why
as
i
went
the
woods
gradually
fell
away
and
i
came
out
upon
an
open
place
the
ground
rose
sharply
before
me
but
i
climbed
on
and
up
and
so
in
time
stood
upon
a
hill
now
standing
upon
this
elevation
with
the
woods
looming
dimly
below
me
as
if
they
were
a
dark
tide
hemming
me
in
on
all
sides
i
became
conscious
of
a
sudden
great
quietude
in
the
air
a
stillness
that
was
like
the
hush
of
expectancy
not
a
sound
came
to
me
not
a
whisper
from
the
myriad
leaves
below
but
as
i
stood
there
listening
very
faint
and
far
away
i
heard
a
murmur
that
rose
and
died
and
rose
again
that
swelled
and
swelled
into
the
roll
of
distant
thunder
down
in
the
woods
was
a
faint
rustling
as
if
some
giant
were
stirring
among
the
leaves
and
out
of
their
depths
breathed
a
puff
of
wind
that
fanned
my
cheek
and
so
was
gone
but
in
a
while
it
was
back
again
stronger
more
insistent
than
before
till
sudden
as
it
came
it
died
away
again
and
all
was
hushed
and
still
save
only
for
the
tremor
down
there
among
the
leaves
but
lightning
flickered
upon
the
horizon
the
thunder
rolled
nearer
and
nearer
and
the
giant
grew
ever
more
restless
round
about
me
in
the
dark
were
imps
that
laughed
and
whispered
together
and
mocked
me
amid
the
leaves
who
is
the
madman
that
stands
upon
a
lonely
hill
at
midnight
bareheaded
half
clad
and
hungers
for
the
storm
peter
vibart
peter
vibart
who
is
he
that
having
eyes
sees
not
and
having
ears
hears
not
peter
vibart
peter
vibart
blow
wind
and
buffet
him
flame
o
lightning
that
he
may
see
roar
o
thunder
that
he
may
hear
and
know
upon
the
stillness
came
a
rustling
loud
and
ever
louder
drowning
all
else
for
the
giant
was
awake
at
last
and
stretching
himself
and
now
up
he
sprang
with
a
sudden
bellow
and
gathering
himself
together
swept
up
towards
me
through
the
swaying
treetops
pelting
me
with
broken
twigs
and
flying
leaves
and
filling
the
air
with
the
tumult
of
his
coming
oh
the
wind
the
bellowing
giant
wind
on
he
came
exulting
whistling
through
my
hair
stopping
my
breath
roaring
in
my
ears
his
savage
wild
halloo
and
as
if
in
answer
forth
from
the
inky
heaven
burst
a
jagged
blinding
flame
that
zigzagged
down
among
the
tossing
trees
and
vanished
with
a
roaring
that
seemed
to
stun
all
things
to
silence
but
not
for
long
for
in
the
darkness
came
the
wind
again
fiercer
wilder
than
before
shrieking
a
defiance
the
thunder
crashed
above
me
and
the
lightning
quivered
in
the
air
about
me
till
my
eyes
ached
with
the
swift
transitions
from
pitch
darkness
to
dazzling
light
light
in
which
distant
objects
started
out
clear
and
well
defined
only
to
be
lost
again
in
a
swirl
of
blackness
and
now
came
rain
a
sudden
hissing
downpour
long
threads
of
scintillating
fire
where
the
lightning
caught
it
rain
that
wetted
me
through
and
through
the
storm
was
at
its
height
and
as
i
listened
rain
and
wind
and
thunder
became
merged
and
blended
into
awful
music
a
symphony
of
life
and
death
played
by
the
hands
of
god
and
i
was
an
atom
a
grain
of
dust
an
insect
to
be
crushed
by
god
little
finger
and
yet
needs
must
this
insect
still
think
upon
its
little
self
for
half
drowned
deafened
blind
and
half
stunned
though
i
was
still
the
voice
within
me
cried
why
why
why
why
was
i
here
instead
of
lying
soft
and
sheltered
and
sleeping
the
blessed
sleep
of
tired
humanity
why
was
i
here
with
death
about
me
and
why
must
i
think
and
think
and
think
of
her
the
whole
breadth
of
heaven
seemed
torn
asunder
blue
flame
crackled
in
the
air
it
ran
hissing
along
the
ground
then
blackness
and
a
thunderclap
that
shook
the
very
hill
beneath
me
and
i
was
down
upon
my
knees
with
the
swish
of
the
rain
about
me
little
by
little
upon
this
silence
stole
the
rustle
of
leaves
and
in
the
leaves
were
the
imps
who
mocked
me
who
is
he
that
doth
love
in
despite
of
himself
and
shall
do
all
his
days
be
she
good
or
evil
whatever
she
was
whatever
she
is
who
is
the
very
fool
of
love
peter
vibart
peter
vibart
and
so
i
bowed
my
face
upon
my
hands
and
remained
thus
a
great
while
heeding
no
more
the
tempest
about
me
for
now
indeed
was
my
question
answered
and
my
fear
realized
i
love
her
whatever
she
was
whatever
she
is
good
or
evil
i
love
her
o
fool
o
most
miserable
fool
and
presently
i
rose
and
went
on
down
the
hill
fast
i
strode
stumbling
and
slipping
plunging
on
heedlessly
through
bush
and
brake
until
at
last
looking
about
me
i
found
myself
on
the
outskirts
of
a
little
spinney
or
copse
and
then
i
became
conscious
that
the
storm
had
passed
for
the
thunder
had
died
down
to
a
murmur
and
the
rain
had
ceased
only
all
about
me
were
little
soft
sounds
as
if
the
trees
were
weeping
silently
together
pushing
on
i
came
into
a
sort
of
narrow
lane
grassy
underfoot
and
shut
in
on
either
hand
by
very
tall
hedges
that
loomed
solid
and
black
in
the
night
and
being
spent
and
weary
i
sat
down
beneath
one
of
these
and
propped
my
chin
in
my
hands
how
long
i
remained
thus
i
can
not
say
but
i
was
at
length
aroused
by
a
voice
a
strangely
sweet
and
gentle
voice
at
no
great
distance
and
the
words
it
uttered
were
these
oh
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
forever
o
lord
i
beseech
thee
look
down
in
thine
infinite
pity
upon
this
thy
world
for
is
at
hand
and
thy
children
must
soon
awake
to
life
and
toil
and
temptation
oh
thou
who
art
the
lover
of
men
let
thy
holy
spirit
wait
to
meet
with
each
one
of
us
upon
the
threshold
of
the
dawn
and
lead
us
through
this
coming
day
like
as
a
father
pitieth
his
children
so
dost
thou
pity
all
the
woeful
and
look
down
upon
all
those
who
must
so
soon
awake
to
their
griefs
speak
comfortably
to
them
remember
those
in
pain
who
must
so
soon
take
up
their
weary
burdens
look
down
upon
the
hungry
and
the
rich
the
evil
and
the
good
that
in
this
new
day
finding
each
something
of
thy
mercy
they
may
give
thanks
unto
the
lord
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
forever
so
the
voice
ended
and
there
were
silence
and
a
profound
stillness
upon
all
things
wherefore
lifting
my
eyes
unto
the
east
i
saw
that
it
was
dawn
chapter
xxvii
the
epileptic
now
when
the
prayer
was
ended
i
turned
my
back
upon
the
lightening
east
and
set
off
along
the
lane
but
as
i
went
i
heard
one
hailing
me
and
glancing
round
saw
that
in
the
hedge
was
a
and
over
this
gate
a
man
was
leaning
a
little
thin
man
with
the
face
of
an
ascetic
or
mediaeval
saint
a
face
of
a
high
and
noble
beauty
upon
whose
scholarly
brow
sat
a
calm
serenity
yet
beneath
which
glowed
the
full
bright
eye
of
the
man
of
action
good
morning
friend
said
he
welcome
to
my
solitude
i
wish
you
joy
of
this
new
day
of
ours
it
is
cloudy
yet
but
there
is
a
rift
down
on
the
horizon
it
will
be
a
fair
day
i
think
on
the
contrary
sir
said
i
to
me
there
are
all
the
evidences
of
the
bad
weather
continuing
i
think
it
will
be
a
bad
day
with
rain
and
probably
thunder
and
lightning
good
morning
sir
stay
cried
he
as
i
turned
away
and
with
the
word
set
his
hand
upon
the
gate
and
vaulting
nimbly
over
came
towards
me
with
a
straw
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
wooden
pipe
in
the
other
sir
said
he
my
cottage
is
close
by
you
look
worn
and
jaded
will
you
not
step
in
and
rest
awhile
thank
you
sir
but
i
must
be
upon
my
way
and
whither
lies
your
way
to
sissinghurst
sir
you
have
a
long
walk
before
you
and
with
your
permission
i
will
accompany
you
a
little
way
with
pleasure
sir
i
answered
though
i
fear
you
will
find
me
a
moody
companion
and
a
somewhat
silent
one
but
then
i
shall
be
the
better
listener
so
light
your
pipe
sir
and
while
you
smoke
talk
my
pipe
said
he
glancing
down
at
it
ah
yes
i
was
about
to
compose
my
sunday
evening
sermon
you
are
a
clergyman
sir
no
no
a
preacher
or
say
rather
a
teacher
and
a
very
humble
one
who
striving
himself
after
truth
seeks
to
lend
such
aid
to
others
as
he
may
truth
said
i
what
is
truth
truth
sir
is
that
which
can
never
pass
away
the
truth
of
life
is
good
works
which
abide
everlastingly
sir
said
i
you
smoke
a
pipe
i
perceive
and
should
therefore
be
a
good
preacher
for
smoking
begets
thought
and
yet
sir
is
not
to
act
greater
than
to
think
why
thought
far
outstrips
puny
action
said
i
it
reaches
deeper
soars
higher
in
our
actions
we
are
pigmies
but
in
our
thoughts
we
may
be
gods
and
embrace
a
universe
but
sighed
the
preacher
while
we
think
our
fellows
perish
in
ignorance
and
want
hum
said
i
thought
pursued
the
preacher
may
become
a
vice
as
it
did
with
the
monks
and
hermits
who
shutting
themselves
away
from
their
kind
wasted
their
lives
upon
their
knees
thinking
noble
thoughts
and
dreaming
of
holy
things
but
leaving
the
world
very
carefully
to
the
devil
and
as
to
smoking
i
am
seriously
considering
giving
it
up
here
he
took
the
pipe
from
his
lips
and
thrust
it
behind
his
back
why
it
has
become
unfortunately
too
human
it
is
a
strange
thing
sir
he
went
on
smiling
and
shaking
his
head
that
this
my
one
indulgence
should
breed
me
more
discredit
than
all
the
cardinal
sins
and
become
a
to
others
only
last
sunday
i
happened
to
overhear
two
old
fellows
talking
fine
sermon
giles
said
the
one
good
enough
replied
the
other
it
might
been
better
ye
see
smokes
so
i
am
seriously
thinking
of
giving
it
up
for
it
would
appear
that
if
a
preacher
prove
himself
as
human
as
his
flock
they
immediately
lose
faith
in
him
and
become
deaf
to
his
teaching
very
true
sir
i
nodded
it
has
always
been
human
to
admire
and
respect
that
only
which
is
in
any
way
different
to
ourselves
in
archaic
times
those
whose
teachings
were
above
men
comprehension
or
who
were
remarkable
for
any
singularity
of
action
were
immediately
deified
pythagoras
recognized
this
truth
when
he
shrouded
himself
in
mystery
and
delivered
his
lectures
from
behind
a
curtain
though
to
be
sure
he
has
come
to
be
regarded
as
something
of
a
charlatan
in
consequence
pray
sir
said
the
preacher
puffing
at
his
pipe
again
may
i
ask
what
you
are
a
blacksmith
sir
and
where
did
you
read
of
pythagoras
and
the
like
at
oxford
sir
how
comes
it
then
that
i
find
you
in
the
dawn
wet
with
rain
buffeted
by
wind
and
most
of
all
a
shoer
of
horses
but
instead
of
answering
i
pointed
to
a
twisted
figure
that
lay
beneath
the
opposite
hedge
a
man
exclaimed
the
preacher
and
asleep
i
think
no
said
i
not
in
that
contorted
attitude
indeed
you
are
right
said
the
preacher
the
man
is
ill
poor
fellow
and
hurrying
forward
he
fell
on
his
knees
beside
the
prostrate
figure
he
was
a
tall
man
roughly
clad
and
he
lay
upon
his
back
rigid
and
motionless
while
upon
his
blue
lips
were
flecks
and
bubbles
of
foam
epilepsy
said
i
the
preacher
nodded
and
busied
himself
with
loosening
the
sodden
neckcloth
the
while
i
unclasped
the
icy
fingers
to
relieve
the
tension
of
the
muscles
the
man
hair
was
long
and
matted
as
was
also
his
beard
and
his
face
all
drawn
and
pale
and
very
deeply
lined
now
as
i
looked
at
him
i
had
a
vague
idea
that
i
had
somewhere
at
some
time
seen
him
before
sir
said
the
preacher
looking
up
will
you
help
me
to
carry
him
to
my
cottage
it
is
not
very
far
so
we
presently
took
the
man
wasted
form
between
us
and
bore
it
easily
enough
to
where
stood
a
small
cottage
bowered
in
roses
and
honeysuckle
and
having
deposited
our
unconscious
burden
upon
the
preacher
humble
bed
i
turned
to
depart
sir
said
the
preacher
holding
out
his
hand
it
is
seldom
one
meets
with
a
blacksmith
who
has
read
the
pythagorean
philosophy
at
oxford
and
i
should
like
to
see
you
again
i
am
a
lonely
man
save
for
my
books
come
and
sup
with
me
some
evening
and
let
us
talk
and
smoke
said
i
the
little
preacher
sighed
i
will
come
said
i
thank
you
and
now
even
as
i
spoke
chancing
to
cast
my
eyes
upon
the
pale
still
face
on
the
bed
i
felt
more
certain
than
ever
that
i
had
somewhere
seen
it
before
chapter
xxviii
in
which
i
come
to
a
determination
as
i
walked
through
the
fresh
green
world
there
ensued
within
me
the
following
dispute
as
it
were
between
myself
and
two
voices
and
the
first
voice
i
will
call
pro
and
the
other
contra
myself
may
the
devil
take
that
gabbing
dick
pro
he
probably
will
myself
had
he
not
told
me
of
what
he
saw
of
the
man
who
looked
at
my
virgil
over
her
shoulder
pro
or
had
you
not
listened
myself
ah
yes
but
then
i
did
listen
and
that
he
spoke
the
truth
is
beyond
all
doubt
the
misplaced
virgil
proves
that
however
it
is
certain
yes
very
certain
that
i
can
remain
no
longer
in
the
hollow
contra
well
there
is
excellent
accommodation
at
the
bull
pro
and
pray
why
leave
the
hollow
myself
because
she
is
a
woman
pro
and
you
love
her
myself
to
my
sorrow
pro
well
but
woman
was
made
for
man
peter
and
man
for
woman
myself
sternly
enough
of
that
i
must
go
pro
being
full
of
bitter
jealousy
myself
no
pro
being
a
mad
jealous
fool
myself
as
you
will
pro
who
has
condemned
her
unheard
with
no
chance
of
justification
myself
at
the
very
latest
i
shall
seek
some
other
habitation
pro
has
she
the
look
of
guilt
myself
no
but
then
women
are
deceitful
by
nature
and
very
skilful
in
disguising
their
faults
at
least
so
i
have
read
in
my
books
pro
contemptuously
books
books
books
myself
shortly
no
matter
i
have
decided
pro
do
you
remember
how
willingly
she
worked
for
you
with
those
slender
capable
hands
of
hers
myself
why
remind
me
of
this
pro
you
must
needs
miss
her
presence
sorely
her
footstep
that
was
always
so
quick
and
light
myself
truly
wonderful
in
one
so
nobly
formed
pro
and
the
way
she
had
of
singing
softly
to
herself
myself
a
beautiful
voice
pro
with
a
caress
in
it
and
then
her
habit
of
looking
at
you
over
her
shoulder
myself
ah
yes
her
lashes
a
little
drooping
her
brows
a
little
wrinkled
her
lips
a
little
parted
contra
a
comfortable
inn
is
the
bull
myself
hastily
yes
yes
certainly
pro
ah
her
lips
the
scarlet
witchery
of
her
lips
do
you
remember
how
sweetly
the
lower
one
curved
upward
to
its
fellow
a
mutinous
mouth
with
its
sudden
bewildering
changes
you
never
quite
knew
which
to
watch
oftenest
her
eyes
or
her
lips
contra
hoarsely
excellent
cooking
at
the
bull
pro
and
how
she
would
berate
you
and
scoff
at
your
master
epictetus
and
philosophers
myself
i
have
sometimes
wondered
at
her
pronounced
antipathy
to
epictetus
pro
and
she
called
you
a
creature
myself
the
meaning
of
which
i
never
quite
fathomed
pro
and
frequently
a
pedant
myself
i
think
not
more
than
four
times
pro
on
such
occasions
you
will
remember
she
had
a
petulant
way
of
twitching
her
shoulder
towards
you
and
frowning
and
occasionally
stamping
her
foot
and
deep
within
you
you
loved
it
all
you
know
you
did
contra
but
that
is
all
over
and
you
are
going
to
the
bull
myself
hurriedly
to
be
sure
the
bull
pro
and
lastly
you
can
not
have
forgotten
you
never
will
forget
the
soft
tumult
of
the
tender
bosom
that
pillowed
your
battered
head
the
pity
of
her
hands
those
great
scalding
tears
the
sudden
swift
caress
of
her
lips
and
the
thrill
in
her
voice
when
she
said
myself
hastily
stop
that
is
all
forgotten
pro
you
lie
you
have
dreamed
of
it
ever
since
working
at
your
anvil
or
lying
upon
your
bed
with
your
eyes
upon
the
stars
you
have
loved
her
from
the
beginning
of
things
myself
and
i
did
not
know
it
i
was
very
blind
the
wonder
is
that
she
did
not
discover
my
love
for
her
long
ago
for
not
knowing
it
was
there
how
should
i
try
to
hide
it
contra
o
blind
and
more
than
blind
why
should
you
suppose
she
has
myself
stopping
short
what
can
it
be
possible
that
she
has
contra
did
she
once
say
that
she
could
read
you
like
a
book
myself
she
did
contra
and
have
you
not
often
surprised
a
smile
upon
her
lips
and
wondered
myself
many
times
contra
have
you
not
beheld
a
mockery
in
her
look
why
poor
fool
has
she
not
mocked
you
from
the
first
you
dream
of
her
lips
were
not
their
smiles
but
coquetry
and
derision
myself
but
why
should
she
deride
me
contra
for
your
youth
and
innocence
myself
my
youth
my
innocence
contra
being
a
fool
ingrain
did
you
boast
that
you
had
known
but
few
women
myself
i
did
but
contra
did
she
call
you
boy
boy
boy
and
laugh
at
you
myself
well
even
so
contra
with
bitter
scorn
o
boy
o
innocent
of
the
innocent
go
to
for
a
bookish
fool
learn
that
lovely
ladies
yield
themselves
but
to
those
who
are
masterful
in
their
wooing
who
have
wooed
often
and
triumphed
as
often
o
innocent
of
the
innocent
forget
the
maudlin
sentiment
of
thy
books
and
old
romances
thy
pure
sir
galahads
thy
vary
parfait
gentil
knightes
thy
meek
and
lowly
lovers
serving
their
ladies
on
bended
knee
open
thine
eyes
learn
that
women
love
only
the
strong
hand
the
bold
eye
the
ready
tongue
kneel
to
her
and
she
will
scorn
and
contemn
you
what
woman
think
you
would
prefer
the
solemn
purity
of
a
sir
galahad
though
he
be
the
king
of
men
to
the
gayety
of
a
debonair
lothario
though
he
be
but
the
shadow
of
a
man
out
upon
thee
student
thy
tongue
hath
not
the
trick
nor
thy
mind
the
nimbleness
for
the
winning
of
a
fair
and
lovely
lady
well
enough
in
want
of
a
better
but
when
lothario
comes
must
she
not
run
to
meet
him
with
arms
outstretched
said
i
clenching
my
fists
i
will
go
away
being
now
come
to
the
hollow
i
turned
aside
to
the
brook
at
that
place
where
was
the
pool
in
which
i
was
wont
to
perform
my
morning
ablutions
and
kneeling
down
i
gazed
at
myself
in
the
dark
still
water
and
i
saw
that
the
night
had
indeed
set
its
mark
upon
me
said
i
again
nodding
to
the
wild
face
below
i
will
go
far
hence
now
while
i
yet
gazed
at
myself
i
heard
a
sudden
gasp
behind
me
and
turning
beheld
charmian
peter
is
it
you
she
whispered
drawing
back
from
me
who
else
charmian
did
i
startle
you
yes
oh
peter
are
you
afraid
of
me
you
are
like
one
who
has
walked
with
death
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
are
you
afraid
of
me
charmian
no
peter
i
am
glad
of
that
said
i
because
i
want
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
charmian
chapter
xxix
in
which
charmian
answers
my
question
peter
yes
i
wish
you
would
would
what
charmian
stir
your
tea
round
and
round
and
round
it
is
really
most
exasperating
i
beg
your
pardon
said
i
humbly
and
you
eat
nothing
and
that
is
also
exasperating
i
am
not
hungry
and
i
was
so
careful
with
the
bacon
see
it
is
fried
beautifully
yes
you
are
very
exasperating
peter
here
finding
i
was
stirring
my
tea
round
and
round
again
i
gulped
it
down
out
of
the
way
whereupon
charmian
took
my
cup
and
refilled
it
having
done
which
she
set
her
elbows
upon
the
table
and
propping
her
chin
in
her
hands
looked
at
me
you
climbed
out
through
your
window
last
night
peter
yes
it
must
have
been
a
dreadfully
tight
squeeze
yes
and
why
did
you
go
by
the
window
i
did
not
wish
to
disturb
you
that
was
very
thoughtful
of
you
only
you
see
i
was
up
and
dressed
the
roar
of
the
thunder
woke
me
it
was
a
dreadful
storm
peter
yes
the
lightning
was
awful
yes
and
you
were
out
in
it
yes
oh
you
poor
poor
peter
how
cold
you
must
have
been
on
the
contrary
i
began
i
and
wet
peter
miserably
wet
and
clammy
i
did
not
notice
it
i
murmured
being
a
philosopher
peter
and
too
much
engrossed
in
your
thoughts
i
was
certainly
thinking
of
yourself
yes
you
are
a
great
egoist
are
you
peter
am
i
charmian
who
but
an
egoist
could
stand
with
his
mind
so
full
of
himself
and
his
own
concerns
as
to
be
oblivious
to
thunder
and
lightning
and
not
know
that
he
is
miserably
clammy
and
wet
i
thought
of
others
besides
myself
but
only
in
connection
with
yourself
everything
you
have
ever
read
or
seen
you
apply
to
yourself
to
make
that
self
more
worthy
in
vibart
eyes
is
this
worthy
of
peter
vibart
can
peter
vibart
do
this
that
or
the
other
and
still
retain
the
respect
of
peter
vibart
then
why
being
in
all
things
so
very
correct
and
precise
why
is
peter
vibart
given
to
prowling
abroad
at
midnight
quite
oblivious
to
thunder
lightning
wet
and
clamminess
i
answer
because
peter
vibart
is
too
much
engrossed
by
peter
vibart
there
that
sounds
rather
cryptic
and
very
full
of
peter
vibart
but
that
is
as
it
should
be
and
she
laughed
and
what
does
it
mean
charmian
good
sir
the
sibyl
hath
spoken
find
her
meaning
for
yourself
you
have
called
me
on
various
occasions
a
a
very
frequently
a
and
now
it
seems
i
am
an
and
all
because
because
you
think
too
much
peter
you
never
open
your
lips
without
having
first
thought
out
just
what
you
are
going
to
say
you
never
do
anything
without
having
laboriously
mapped
it
all
out
beforehand
that
you
may
not
outrage
peter
vibart
tranquillity
by
any
impulsive
act
or
speech
oh
you
are
always
thinking
and
thinking
and
that
is
even
worse
than
stirring
and
stirring
at
your
tea
as
you
are
doing
now
i
took
the
spoon
hastily
from
my
cup
and
laid
it
as
far
out
of
reach
as
possible
if
ever
you
should
write
the
book
you
once
spoke
of
it
would
be
just
the
very
sort
of
book
that
i
should
hate
why
charmian
because
it
would
be
a
book
of
artfully
turned
phrases
a
book
in
which
all
the
characters
especially
women
would
think
and
speak
and
act
by
rote
and
rule
as
according
to
peter
vibart
it
would
be
a
scholarly
book
of
elaborate
finish
and
care
of
detail
with
no
irregularities
of
style
or
anything
else
to
break
the
monotonous
harmony
of
the
whole
indeed
sir
it
would
be
a
most
unreadable
book
do
you
think
so
charmian
said
i
once
more
taking
up
the
teaspoon
why
of
course
she
answered
with
raised
brows
it
would
probably
be
full
of
greek
and
latin
quotations
and
you
would
polish
and
rewrite
it
until
you
had
polished
every
vestige
of
life
and
spontaneity
out
of
it
as
you
do
out
of
yourself
with
your
thinking
and
thinking
but
i
never
quote
you
greek
or
latin
that
is
surely
something
and
as
for
thinking
would
you
have
me
a
thoughtless
fool
or
an
impulsive
ass
anything
rather
than
a
calculating
introspective
philosopher
seeing
only
the
mote
in
the
sunbeam
and
nothing
of
the
glory
here
she
gently
disengaged
the
teaspoon
from
my
fingers
and
laid
it
in
her
own
saucer
having
done
which
she
sighed
and
looked
at
me
with
her
head
to
one
side
were
they
all
like
you
peter
i
wonder
those
old
philosophers
grim
and
stern
and
terribly
repressed
with
burning
eyes
peter
and
with
very
long
chins
epictetus
was
of
course
and
you
dislike
epictetus
charmian
i
detest
him
he
was
just
the
kind
of
person
peter
who
being
unable
to
sleep
would
have
wandered
out
into
a
terrible
thunderstorm
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
being
cold
and
wet
and
clammy
peter
would
have
drawn
moral
lessons
and
made
epigrams
upon
the
thunder
and
lightning
epictetus
i
am
quite
sure
was
a
person
he
was
one
of
the
wisest
gentlest
and
most
lovable
of
all
the
stoics
said
i
can
a
philosopher
possibly
be
lovable
peter
here
i
very
took
up
a
fork
but
finding
her
eye
upon
me
laid
it
down
again
you
are
very
nervous
peter
and
very
pale
and
worn
and
haggard
and
all
because
you
habitually
overthink
yourself
and
indeed
there
is
something
very
far
wrong
with
a
man
who
perseveringly
stirs
an
empty
cup
with
a
fork
and
with
a
laugh
she
took
my
cup
and
having
once
more
refilled
it
set
it
before
me
and
yet
peter
i
do
think
no
i
do
think
i
would
have
you
very
much
changed
after
all
you
mean
that
you
would
rather
i
remained
the
pedantic
egotistical
creature
i
mean
peter
that
being
a
woman
i
naturally
love
novelty
and
you
are
very
novel
and
very
interesting
thank
you
said
i
frowning
and
more
contradictory
than
any
woman
hum
said
i
you
are
so
strong
and
simple
so
wise
and
brave
and
so
very
weak
and
foolish
and
timid
timid
said
i
timid
nodded
she
i
am
a
vast
fool
i
acknowledged
and
i
never
knew
a
man
anything
like
you
before
peter
and
you
have
known
many
i
understand
very
many
yes
you
told
me
so
once
before
i
believe
twice
peter
and
each
time
you
became
very
silent
and
gloomy
now
you
on
the
other
hand
she
continued
have
known
very
few
women
and
my
life
has
been
calm
and
unruffled
in
consequence
you
had
your
books
peter
and
your
horseshoes
my
books
and
horseshoes
yes
and
were
content
quite
content
until
one
day
a
woman
came
to
you
until
one
day
i
met
a
woman
and
then
and
then
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
charmian
here
there
ensued
a
pause
during
which
charmian
began
to
pleat
a
fold
in
the
tablecloth
that
was
rather
unwise
of
you
was
it
said
she
at
last
how
unwise
because
she
might
have
taken
you
at
your
word
peter
do
you
mean
that
that
you
wo
charmian
oh
dear
no
i
have
arrived
at
no
decision
yet
how
could
i
you
must
give
me
time
to
consider
here
she
paused
in
her
pleating
to
regard
it
critically
with
her
head
on
one
side
to
be
sure
said
she
with
a
little
nod
to
be
sure
you
need
some
one
to
to
look
after
you
that
is
very
evident
yes
to
cook
and
wash
for
you
yes
to
mend
your
clothes
for
you
yes
and
you
think
me
sufficiently
competent
oh
charmian
i
yes
thank
you
said
she
very
solemnly
and
though
her
lashes
had
drooped
i
felt
the
mockery
of
her
eyes
wherefore
i
took
a
sudden
great
gulp
of
tea
and
came
near
choking
while
charmian
began
to
pleat
another
fold
in
the
tablecloth
and
so
vibart
would
stoop
to
wed
so
humble
a
person
as
charmian
brown
peter
vibart
would
actually
marry
a
woman
of
whose
past
he
knows
nothing
yes
said
i
that
again
would
be
rather
unwise
would
it
why
considering
vibart
very
lofty
ideals
in
regard
to
women
what
do
you
mean
did
you
once
say
that
your
wife
name
must
be
above
suspicion
like
caesar
or
something
of
the
kind
did
i
yes
perhaps
i
did
well
well
this
woman
this
humble
person
has
no
name
at
all
and
no
shred
of
reputation
left
her
she
has
compromised
herself
beyond
all
redemption
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
but
then
said
i
this
world
and
i
have
always
mutually
despised
each
other
she
ran
away
this
woman
eloped
with
the
most
notorious
the
most
accomplished
rake
in
london
well
oh
is
not
that
enough
enough
for
what
charmian
i
saw
her
busy
fingers
falter
and
tremble
but
her
voice
was
steady
when
she
answered
enough
to
make
any
wise
man
think
twice
before
asking
this
humble
person
to
to
marry
him
i
might
think
twenty
times
and
it
would
be
all
one
you
mean
that
if
charmian
brown
will
stoop
to
marry
a
village
blacksmith
peter
vibart
will
find
happiness
again
a
happiness
that
is
not
of
the
sunshine
nor
the
wind
in
the
trees
lord
what
a
fool
i
was
her
fingers
had
stopped
altogether
now
but
she
neither
spoke
nor
raised
her
head
charmian
said
i
leaning
nearer
across
the
table
speak
oh
peter
said
she
with
a
sudden
break
in
her
voice
and
stooped
her
head
lower
yet
in
a
little
she
looked
up
at
me
and
her
eyes
were
very
sweet
and
shining
now
as
our
glances
met
thus
up
from
throat
to
brow
there
crept
that
hot
slow
wave
of
color
and
in
her
face
and
in
her
eyes
i
seemed
to
read
joy
and
fear
and
shame
and
radiant
joy
again
but
now
she
bent
her
head
once
more
and
strove
to
pleat
another
fold
and
could
not
while
i
grew
suddenly
afraid
of
her
and
of
myself
and
longed
to
hurl
aside
the
table
that
divided
us
and
thrust
my
hands
deep
into
my
pockets
and
finding
there
my
brought
it
out
and
fell
to
turning
it
aimlessly
over
and
over
i
would
have
spoken
only
i
knew
that
my
voice
would
tremble
and
so
i
sat
staring
at
my
pipe
with
unseeing
eyes
and
with
my
brain
in
a
ferment
and
presently
came
her
voice
cool
and
sweet
and
sane
your
tobacco
peter
and
she
held
the
box
towards
me
across
the
table
ah
thank
you
said
i
and
began
to
fill
my
pipe
while
she
watched
me
with
her
chin
propped
in
her
hands
peter
yes
charmian
i
wonder
why
so
grave
a
person
as
peter
vibart
should
seek
to
marry
so
impossible
a
creature
as
the
humble
person
i
think
i
answered
i
think
if
there
is
any
special
reason
it
is
because
of
your
mouth
my
mouth
or
your
eyes
or
the
way
you
have
with
your
lashes
charmian
laughed
and
forthwith
drooped
them
at
me
and
laughed
again
and
shook
her
head
but
surely
peter
surely
there
are
thousands
millions
of
women
with
mouths
and
eyes
like
the
humble
person
it
is
possible
said
i
but
none
who
have
the
same
way
with
their
lashes
what
do
you
mean
i
ca
tell
i
do
know
do
you
peter
no
it
is
just
a
way
and
so
it
is
that
you
want
to
marry
this
very
humble
person
i
think
i
have
wanted
to
from
the
very
first
but
did
not
know
it
being
a
blind
fool
and
did
it
need
a
night
walk
in
a
thunderstorm
to
teach
you
no
that
is
yes
perhaps
it
did
and
are
you
quite
quite
sure
quite
quite
sure
said
i
and
as
i
spoke
i
laid
my
pipe
upon
the
table
and
rose
and
because
my
hands
were
trembling
i
clenched
my
fists
but
as
i
approached
her
she
started
up
and
put
out
a
hand
to
hold
me
off
and
then
i
saw
that
her
hands
were
trembling
also
and
standing
thus
she
spoke
very
softly
peter
yes
charmian
do
you
remember
describing
to
me
the
the
perfect
woman
who
should
be
your
wife
yes
how
that
you
must
be
able
to
respect
her
for
her
intellect
yes
honor
her
for
her
virtue
yes
charmian
and
worship
her
for
her
spotless
purity
i
dreamed
a
paragon
perfect
and
impossible
i
was
a
fool
said
i
impossible
oh
peter
what
what
do
you
mean
she
was
only
an
impalpable
shade
quite
impossible
of
realization
a
bloodless
thing
as
you
said
and
quite
unnatural
a
sickly
figment
of
the
imagination
i
was
a
fool
and
you
are
too
wise
now
to
expect
such
virtues
in
any
woman
yes
said
i
no
oh
charmian
i
only
know
that
you
have
taken
this
phantom
place
that
you
fill
all
my
thoughts
sleeping
and
waking
no
no
she
cried
and
struggled
in
my
arms
so
that
i
caught
her
hands
and
held
them
close
and
kissed
them
many
times
oh
charmian
charmian
do
you
know
ca
you
see
it
is
you
i
want
you
and
only
you
forever
whatever
you
were
whatever
you
are
i
love
you
love
you
and
always
must
marry
me
charmian
marry
me
and
you
shall
be
dearer
than
my
life
more
to
me
than
my
soul
but
as
i
spoke
her
hands
were
snatched
away
her
eyes
blazed
into
mine
and
her
lips
were
all
bitter
scorn
and
at
the
sight
fear
came
upon
me
marry
you
she
panted
marry
you
no
and
no
and
no
and
so
she
stamped
her
foot
and
sobbed
and
turning
fled
from
me
out
of
the
cottage
and
now
to
fear
came
wonder
and
with
wonder
was
despair
truly
was
ever
man
so
great
a
fool
chapter

concerning
the
fate
of
black
george
a
broad
white
road
on
either
hand
some
cottages
with
roofs
of
thatch
or
red
tile
backed
by
trees
gnarled
and
ancient
among
which
rises
the
red
conical
roof
of
some
such
in
a
word
is
sissinghurst
now
upon
the
side
of
the
way
there
stands
a
square
comfortable
whitewashed
building
peaked
of
roof
bright
as
to
windows
and
with
a
mighty
sign
before
the
door
whereon
you
shall
behold
the
picture
of
a
bull
a
bull
rolling
of
eye
astonishingly
curly
of
horn
and
stiff
as
to
tail
and
with
a
prodigious
girth
of
neck
and
shoulder
such
a
snorting
bull
as
was
never
seen
off
an
it
was
at
this
bull
that
i
was
staring
with
much
apparent
interest
though
indeed
had
that
same
monstrosity
been
changed
by
some
enchanter
wand
into
a
green
dragon
or
griffin
or
swan
with
two
necks
the
chances
are
that
i
should
have
continued
sublimely
unconscious
of
the
transformation
yet
how
should
honest
silas
hoskins
ostler
and
general
factotum
of
the
bull
inn
be
aware
of
this
fact
who
being
thus
early
at
work
and
seeing
me
lost
in
contemplation
paused
to
address
me
in
all
good
faith
a
fine
bull
be
eh
peter
look
at
them
an
that
theer
tail
it
seldom
as
you
sees
or
a
tail

like
o
them
eh
very
seldom
i
answered
and
sighed
an
then
peter
jest
cast
your
eye
on
them
will
ye
why
dang
me
if
i
ca
when
i
looks
at
an
were
all
painted
by
a
chap
a
little
old
chap
wi
gray
whiskers
no
taller

elber
peter
think
o
that
a
little
chap
no
taller

elber

it
wi
my
two
eyes
on
a
box

then
outs
wi
a
couple
o
brushes

again
an
by
goles
theer
was
a
pair
o
eyes
theirselves
at
me
just
a
pair
o
eyes
peter
ah
were
a
wonder
were
that
little
old
chap
gray
whiskers
the
way
went
at
that
theer
bull
at
an
at
theer
till
come
to

last
of
all
peter
un
a

a
good
stiff
un
says
i
jest
keep
your
eye
on
it
an
watch
says
talk
about

peter
put
in
that
theer
tail
so
quick
as
nigh
made
my
eyes
water
an
as
for
stiffness
well
look
at
it
i
tell
that
chap
could
paint
a
bull
wi
eyes
shut
ah
that
could
an
such
a
very
small
man
gray
whiskers
no
ye
do
see
many
bulls
like
that
un
theer
thinkin
peter
they
would
be
very
hard
to
find
said
i
and
sighed
again
whereupon
silas
sighed
for
company
sake
and
nodding
went
off
about
his
many
duties
whistling
cheerily
so
i
presently
turned
about
and
crossed
the
road
to
the
smithy
but
upon
the
threshold
i
stopped
all
at
once
and
drew
softly
back
for
despite
the
early
hour
prudence
was
there
upon
her
knees
before
the
anvil
with
george
great
clasped
to
her
bosom
sobbing
over
it
and
while
she
sobbed
she
kissed
its
worn
handle
and
because
such
love
was
sacred
and
hallowed
that
dingy
place
i
took
off
my
hat
as
i
once
more
crossed
the
road
seeing
the
bull
was
not
yet
astir
for
the
day
was
still
young
as
i
say
i
sat
me
down
in
the
porch
and
sighed
and
after
i
had
sat
there
for
some
while
with
my
chin
sunk
upon
my
breast
and
plunged
in
bitter
meditation
i
became
aware
of
the
door
opening
and
next
moment
a
tremulous
hand
was
laid
upon
my
head
and
looking
round
i
beheld
the
ancient
bless
peter
bless

an
a
old
man

yet
let
fules
say
what
they

peter
we
show
so
saying
the
old
man
led
me
into
the
kitchen
of
the
bull
while
simon
went
to
have
the
horses
put
to
chapter
xxxi
in
which
the
ancient
is
surprised
a
cheery
place
at
all
times
is
the
kitchen
of
an
english
inn
a
comfortable
place
to
eat
in
to
talk
in
or
to
doze
in
a
place
with
which
your
parlors
and
your
salons
a
la
the
three
louis
with
their
irritating
rococo
their
gilt
and
satin
and
discomforts
are
not
to
my
mind
worthy
to
compare
and
what
inn
kitchen
in
all
broad
england
was
ever
brighter
neater
and
more
comfortable
than
this
kitchen
of
the
bull
where
sweet
prue
held
supreme
sway
with
such
grave
dignity
and
with
her
two
maids
to
do
her
bidding
and
behests
surely
none
and
surely
in
no
inn
tavern
or
hostelry
soever
great
or
small
was
there
ever
seen
a
daintier
prettier
sweeter
hostess
than
this
same
prue
of
ours
and
her
presence
was
reflected
everywhere
and
if
ever
the
kitchen
of
an
inn
possessed
a
heart
to
lose
then
beyond
all
doubt
this
kitchen
had
lost
its
heart
to
prue
long
since
even
the
battered
cutlasses
crossed
upon
the
wall
the
ponderous
jack
above
the
hearth
with
its
legend
anno
domini
took
on
a
brighter
sheen
to
greet
her
when
she
came
and
as
for
the
pots
and
pans
they
fairly
twinkled
but
today
prue
eyes
were
red
and
her
lips
were
all
the
which
though
her
smile
was
brave
and
ready
the
ancient
was
quick
to
notice
why
prue
lass

been
weepin
yes
grandfer
your
pretty
eyes
be
all
swole
red
they

all

said
she
from
the
hollow
of
his
shoulder
is
just
jarge
the
old
man
grew
very
still
his
mouth
opened
slowly
and
closed
with
a
snap
did
say
jarge
prue
is
it
breekin
your
ye
be
for
that
theer
poachin
black
jarge
to
think
as
my
prue
should
come
down
to
a
poachin
prudence
slipped
from
his
encircling
arm
and
stood
up
very
straight
and
proud
there
were
tears
thick
upon
her
lashes
but
she
did
not
attempt
to
wipe
them
away
grandfer
she
said
very
gently
you
must
speak
of

me
like
that

he
will
only

if
he
never
comes
back
then
i
think

the
ancient
took
out
his
knocked
it
opened
it
glanced
inside
and
shut
it
up
again
did
tell
me
as
you
love

jarge
prue

black
jarge
he
repeated
allus
allus

oh
lord
what
i
done
now
very
slowly
a
tear
crept
down
his
wrinkled
cheek
at
sight
of
which
prue
gave
a
little
cry
and
kneeling
beside
his
chair
took
him
in
her
arms
oh

little
prue

and
the
voice
of
simon
calling
wherefore
i
took

followed
the
ancient
to

and
kissed

upon
the
cheek
instead
for
good
luck
prue
said
i
and
so
turned
and
left
her
in
the
porch
sat
job
with
old
amos
and
the
rest
still
in
solemn
conclave
over
pipes
and
ale
who
watched
with
gloomy
brows
as
i
swung
myself
up
beside
the
ancient
in
the
cart
a
fule
journey
remarked
old
amos
sententiously
with
a
wave
of
his
pipe

observing
eye
up
at
the
cloudless
sky

strong

occasions
we
drove
away
from
the
silenced
group
who
stared
mutely
after
us
until
we
were
lost
to
view
but
the
last
thing
i
saw
was
the
light
in

sweet
eyes
as
she
watched
us
from
the
open
lattice

roared
a
greeting
a
fellow
whose
beefy
face
was
adorned
with
a
pair
of
enormous
fiery
whiskers
that
seemed
forever
striving
to
hide
his
ears

being
very
large

dart
across

that
length
of
limb

jogged
back
towards
sissinghurst
what
be
you
your
over
old
un
inquired
simon
after
we
had
ridden
some
distance
i
were
wonderin
what
that
old
fule
amos
say
when
we
drive
back
jarge
being
come
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
i
descended
from
the
cart
for
my
head
was
strangely
heavy
and
i
felt
much
out
of
sorts
and
though
the
day
was
still
young
i
had
no
mind
for
work
therefore
i
bade
adieu
to
simon
and
the
ancient
and
turned
aside
towards
the
hollow
leaving
them
staring
after
me
in
wonderment
chapter
xxxiii
in
which
i
fall
from
folly
into
madness
it
was
with
some
little
trepidation
that
i
descended
into
the
hollow
and
walked
along
beside
the
brook
for
soon
i
should
meet
charmian
and
the
memory
of
our
parting
and
the
thought
of
this
meeting
had
been
in
my
mind
all
day
long
she
would
not
be
expecting
me
yet
for
i
was
much
before
my
usual
time
wherefore
i
walked
on
slowly
beside
the
brook
deliberating
on
what
i
should
say
to
her
until
i
came
to
that
large
stone
where
i
had
sat
dreaming
the
night
when
she
had
stood
in
the
moonlight
and
first
bidden
me
in
to
supper
and
now
sinking
upon
this
stone
i
set
my
elbows
upon
my
knees
and
my
chin
in
my
hands
and
fixing
my
eyes
upon
the
waters
of
the
brook
fell
into
a
profound
meditation
from
this
i
was
suddenly
aroused
by
the
clink
of
iron
and
the
snort
of
a
horse
wondering
i
lifted
my
eyes
but
the
bushes
were
very
dense
and
i
could
see
nothing
but
in
a
little
borne
upon
the
gentle
wind
came
the
sound
of
a
voice
low
and
soft
and
very
sweet
whose
rich
tones
there
was
no
mistaking
followed
almost
immediately
by
another
deeper
gruffer
the
voice
of
a
man
with
a
bound
i
was
upon
my
feet
and
had
somehow
crossed
the
brook
but
even
so
i
was
too
late
there
was
the
crack
of
a
whip
followed
by
the
muffled
thud
of
a
horse
hoofs
which
died
quickly
away
and
was
lost
in
the
stir
of
leaves
i
ground
my
teeth
and
cursed
that
fate
which
seemed
determined
that
i
should
not
meet
this
man
face
to
face
this
man
whose
back
i
had
seen
but
once
a
back
clad
in
a
blue
coat
i
stood
where
i
was
dumb
and
rigid
staring
straight
before
me
and
once
again
a
tremor
passed
over
me
that
came
and
went
growing
stronger
and
stronger
and
once
again
in
my
head
was
the
thud
thud
thud
of
the
hammer
scarlet
town
where
i
was
born
there
was
a
fair
maid
dwellin
made
every
youth
cry
her
name
was
barbara
allen
she
was
approaching
by
that
leafy
path
that
wound
its
way
along
beside
the
brook
and
there
came
upon
me
a
physical
nausea
and
ever
the
thud
of
the
hammer
grew
more
maddening
in
the
merry
month
of
may
when
green
buds
they
were
swellin
young
jemmy
grove
on
his
lay
for
love
of
barbara
allen
now
as
she
ended
the
verse
she
came
out
into
the
open
and
saw
me
and
seeing
me
looked
deliberately
over
my
head
and
went
on
singing
while
i
stood
shivering
slowly
slowly
rase
she
up
and
slowly
she
came
nigh
him
and
when
she
drew
the
curtain
by
young
man
i
think
you
dyin
and
suddenly
the
trees
and
bushes
swung
giddily
round
the
grass
swayed
beneath
my
feet
and
charmian
was
beside
me
with
her
arm
about
my
shoulders
but
i
pushed
her
from
me
and
leaned
against
a
tree
near
by
and
hearkened
to
the
hammer
in
my
brain
why
peter
said
she
oh
peter
please
charmian
said
i
speaking
between
the
do
not
touch
me
again
it
is
too
soon
after
what
do
you
mean
peter
what
do
you
mean
he
has
been
with
you
again
what
do
you
mean
she
cried
i
know
of
his
visits
if
he
was
the
same
as
last
time
in
a
blue
coat
no
do
do
touch
me
but
she
had
sprung
upon
me
and
caught
me
by
the
arms
and
shook
me
in
a
grip
so
strong
that
giddy
as
i
was
i
reeled
and
staggered
like
a
drunken
man
and
still
her
voice
hissed
what
do
you
mean
and
her
voice
and
hands
and
eyes
were
strangely
compelling
i
mean
i
answered
in
a
low
even
voice
like
one
in
a
trance
that
you
are
a
messalina
a
julia
a
joan
of
naples
beautiful
as
they
and
as
wanton
now
at
the
word
she
cried
out
and
struck
me
twice
across
the
face
blows
that
burnt
and
stung
beast
she
cried
liar
oh
that
i
had
the
strength
to
grind
you
into
the
earth
beneath
my
foot
oh
you
poor
blind
fool
and
she
laughed
and
her
laughter
stung
me
most
of
all
as
i
look
at
you
she
went
on
the
laugh
still
curling
her
lip
you
stand
there
what
you
are
a
beaten
hound
this
is
my
last
look
and
i
shall
always
remember
you
as
i
see
you
now
shamefaced
a
beaten
hound
and
speaking
she
shook
her
hand
at
me
and
turned
upon
her
heel
but
with
that
word
and
in
that
instant
the
old
old
demon
leapt
up
within
me
and
as
he
leapt
i
clasped
my
arms
about
her
and
caught
her
up
and
crushed
her
close
and
high
against
my
breast
go
said
i
go
no
no
not
yet
and
now
as
her
eyes
met
mine
i
felt
her
tremble
yet
she
strove
to
hide
her
fear
and
heaped
me
with
bitter
scorn
but
i
only
shook
my
head
and
smiled
and
now
she
struggled
to
break
my
clasp
fiercely
desperately
her
long
hair
burst
its
fastenings
and
enveloped
us
both
in
its
rippling
splendor
she
beat
my
face
she
wound
her
fingers
in
my
hair
but
my
lips
smiled
on
for
the
hammer
in
my
brain
had
deadened
all
else
and
presently
she
lay
still
i
felt
her
body
relax
and
grow
suddenly
pliable
and
soft
her
head
fell
back
across
my
arm
and
as
she
lay
i
saw
the
tears
of
her
helplessness
ooze
out
beneath
her
drooping
lashes
but
still
i
smiled
so
with
her
long
hair
trailing
over
me
i
bore
her
to
the
cottage
closing
the
door
behind
me
with
my
foot
i
crossed
the
room
and
set
her
down
upon
the
bed
she
lay
very
still
but
her
bosom
heaved
tumultuously
and
the
tears
still
crept
from
beneath
her
lashes
but
in
a
while
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
me
and
shivered
and
crouched
farther
from
me
among
the
pillows
why
did
you
lie
to
me
charmian
why
did
you
lie
to
me
she
did
not
answer
only
she
watched
me
as
one
might
watch
some
relentless
oncoming
peril
i
asked
you
once
if
you
ever
saw
men
hereabouts
when
i
was
away
do
you
remember
you
told
me
and
while
you
spoke
i
knew
you
lied
for
i
had
seen
him
standing
among
the
leaves
waiting
and
watching
for
you
i
once
asked
you
if
you
were
ever
lonely
when
i
was
away
and
you
answered
you
were
too
busy
went
beyond
the
hollow
do
you
remember
and
yet
you
had
brought
him
here
here
into
the
cottage
he
had
looked
at
my
virgil
over
your
shoulder
do
you
remember
you
played
the
spy
she
whispered
with
trembling
lips
yet
with
eyes
still
fierce
and
scornful
you
know
i
did
not
had
i
seen
him
i
should
have
killed
him
because
i
loved
you
i
had
set
up
an
altar
to
you
in
my
heart
where
my
soul
might
worship
poor
fool
that
i
was
i
loved
you
with
every
breath
i
drew
i
think
i
must
have
shown
you
something
of
this
from
time
to
time
for
you
are
very
clever
and
you
may
have
laughed
over
it
together
you
and
he
and
lately
i
have
seen
my
altar
foully
desecrated
shattered
and
utterly
destroyed
and
with
it
your
sweet
womanhood
dragged
in
the
mire
and
yet
i
loved
you
still
can
you
imagine
i
wonder
the
agony
of
it
the
haunting
horrors
of
imagination
the
bitter
days
the
sleepless
nights
to
see
you
so
beautiful
so
glorious
and
know
you
so
base
indeed
i
think
it
came
near
driving
me
mad
it
has
sent
me
out
into
the
night
i
have
held
out
my
arms
for
the
lightning
to
blast
me
i
have
wished
myself
a
thousand
deaths
if
black
george
had
but
struck
a
little
harder
or
a
little
lighter
i
am
not
the
man
i
was
before
he
thrashed
me
my
head
grows
confused
and
clouded
at
times
would
to
god
i
were
dead
but
now
you
would
go
having
killed
my
heart
broken
my
life
driven
away
all
peace
of
mind
you
would
leave
me
no
charmian
i
swear
by
god
you
shall
not
go
yet
awhile
i
have
bought
you
very
dear
bought
you
with
my
bitter
agony
and
by
all
the
blasting
torments
i
have
suffered
now
as
i
ended
she
sprang
from
the
bed
and
faced
me
but
meeting
my
look
she
shrank
a
little
and
drew
her
long
hair
about
her
like
a
mantle
then
sought
with
trembling
hands
to
hold
me
off
peter
be
sane
oh
peter
be
merciful
and
let
me
go
give
me
time
let
me
explain
my
books
said
i
have
taught
me
that
the
more
beautiful
a
face
the
more
guileful
is
her
heart
and
your
face
is
wonderfully
beautiful
and
as
for
your
heart
you
lied
to
me
before
i
oh
peter
i
am
not
the
poor
creature
you
think
me
were
you
the
proudest
lady
in
the
land
you
have
deceived
me
and
mocked
me
and
lied
to
me
so
saying
i
reached
out
and
seized
her
by
each
rounded
arm
and
slowly
drew
her
closer
and
now
she
strove
no
more
against
me
only
in
her
face
was
bitter
scorn
and
an
anger
that
cast
out
fear
i
hate
you
despise
you
she
whispered
i
hate
you
more
than
any
man
was
ever
hated
inch
by
inch
i
drew
her
to
me
until
she
stood
close
within
the
circle
of
my
arms
and
i
think
i
love
you
more
than
any
woman
was
ever
loved
said
i
for
the
glorious
beauty
of
your
strong
sweet
body
for
the
temptation
of
your
eyes
for
the
red
lure
of
your
lips
and
so
i
stooped
and
kissed
her
full
upon
the
mouth
she
lay
soft
and
warm
in
my
embrace
all
unresisting
only
she
shivered
beneath
my
kiss
and
a
great
sob
rent
her
bosom
and
i
also
think
said
i
that
because
of
the
perfidy
of
your
heart
i
hate
you
as
much
as
you
do
me
as
much
as
ever
woman
dead
or
living
was
hated
by
man
and
shall
forever
and
while
i
spoke
i
loosed
her
and
turned
and
strode
swiftly
out
and
away
from
the
cottage
chapter
xxxiv
in
which
i
find
peace
and
joy
and
an
abiding
sorrow
i
hurried
on
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
seeing
only
the
face
of
charmian
now
fearful
and
appealing
now
blazing
with
scorn
and
coming
to
the
brook
i
sat
down
and
thought
upon
her
marvellous
beauty
of
the
firm
roundness
of
the
arms
that
my
fingers
had
so
lately
pressed
anon
i
started
up
again
and
plunged
through
the
brook
and
strode
on
and
on
bursting
my
way
through
bramble
and
briar
heedless
of
their
petty
stings
till
at
last
i
was
clear
of
them
being
now
among
trees
and
here
where
the
shadow
was
deepest
i
came
upon
a
lurking
figure
a
figure
i
recognized
a
figure
there
was
no
mistaking
and
which
i
should
have
known
in
a
thousand
a
shortish
man
clad
in
a
blue
coat
who
stood
with
his
back
towards
me
looking
down
into
the
hollow
in
the
attitude
of
one
who
waits
for
what
for
whom
he
was
cut
off
from
me
by
a
solitary
bush
a
bramble
that
seemed
to
have
strayed
from
its
kind
and
lost
itself
and
running
upon
my
toes
i
cleared
this
bush
at
a
bound
and
before
the
fellow
had
realized
my
presence
i
had
pinned
him
by
the
collar
damn
you
show
your
face
i
cried
and
swung
him
round
so
fiercely
that
he
staggered
and
his
hat
fell
off
then
as
i
saw
i
clasped
my
head
between
my
hands
and
fell
back
staring
a
grizzled
man
with
an
honest
open
face
a
man
whose
homely
features
were
lighted
by
a
pair
of
kindly
blue
eyes
just
now
round
with
astonishment
lord
mr
peter
he
exclaimed
adam
i
groaned
oh
god
forgive
me
it
adam
lord
peter
said
he
again
you
sure
give
me
a
turn
sir
but
what
the
matter
wi
you
sir
come
peter
never
stare
so
wild
like
come
sir
what
is
it
tell
me
quick
said
i
catching
his
hand
in
mine
you
have
been
here
many
times
before
of
late
why
yes
peter
but
quick
said
i
on
one
occasion
she
took
you
into
the
cottage
yonder
and
showed
you
a
book
you
looked
at
it
over
her
shoulder
yes
sir
but
what
sort
of
book
was
it
a
old
book
sir
wi
the
cover
broke
and
wi
your
name
writ
down
inside
of
it
was
that
way
as
she
found
out
who
you
was
oh
adam
i
cried
oh
adam
now
may
god
help
me
and
dropping
his
hand
i
turned
and
ran
until
i
reached
the
cottage
but
it
was
empty
charmian
was
gone
in
a
fever
of
haste
i
sought
her
along
the
brook
among
the
bushes
and
trees
even
along
the
road
and
as
i
sought
night
fell
and
in
the
shadows
was
black
despair
i
searched
the
hollow
from
end
to
end
calling
upon
her
name
but
no
sound
reached
me
save
the
hoot
of
an
owl
and
the
dismal
cry
of
a
corncrake
with
some
faint
hope
that
she
might
have
returned
to
the
cottage
i
hastened
thither
but
finding
it
dark
and
desolate
i
gave
way
to
my
despair
o
blind
fool
she
had
said
that
and
she
was
right
as
usual
she
had
called
me
an
egoist
i
was
an
egoist
a
pedant
a
blind
fool
who
had
wilfully
destroyed
all
hopes
of
a
happiness
the
very
thought
of
which
had
so
often
set
me
trembling
and
now
she
had
left
me
was
gone
the
world
my
world
was
a
void
its
emptiness
terrified
me
how
should
i
live
without
charmian
the
woman
whose
image
was
ever
before
my
eyes
whose
soft
low
voice
was
ever
in
my
ears
and
i
had
thought
so
much
to
please
her
i
who
had
set
my
thoughts
to
guard
my
tongue
lest
by
word
or
look
i
might
offend
her
and
this
was
the
end
of
it
sitting
down
at
the
table
i
leaned
my
head
there
pressing
my
forehead
against
the
hard
wood
and
remained
thus
a
great
while
at
last
because
it
was
very
dark
i
found
and
lighted
a
candle
and
came
and
stood
beside
her
bed
very
white
and
trim
it
looked
yet
i
was
glad
to
see
its
smoothness
rumpled
where
i
had
laid
her
down
and
to
see
the
depression
in
the
pillow
that
her
head
had
made
and
while
i
stood
there
up
to
me
stole
a
perfume
very
faint
like
the
breath
of
violets
in
a
wood
at
evening
time
wherefore
i
sank
down
upon
my
knees
beside
the
bed
and
now
the
full
knowledge
of
my
madness
rushed
upon
me
in
an
overwhelming
flood
but
with
misery
was
a
great
and
mighty
joy
for
now
i
knew
her
worthy
of
all
respect
and
honor
and
worship
for
her
intellect
for
her
proud
virtue
and
for
her
spotless
purity
and
thus
with
joy
came
remorse
and
with
remorse
an
abiding
sorrow
and
gradually
my
arms
crept
about
the
pillow
where
her
head
had
so
often
rested
wherefore
i
kissed
it
and
laid
my
head
upon
it
and
sighed
and
so
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
chapter
xxxv
how
black
george
found
prudence
in
the
dawn
the
chill
of
dawn
was
in
the
air
when
i
awoke
and
it
was
some
few
moments
before
with
a
rush
i
remembered
why
i
was
kneeling
there
beside
charmian
bed
shivering
i
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
to
reduce
the
stiffness
in
my
limbs
the
fire
was
out
and
i
had
no
mind
to
light
it
for
i
was
in
no
mood
to
break
my
fast
though
the
necessary
things
stood
ready
as
her
orderly
hands
had
set
them
and
the
plates
and
cups
and
saucers
twinkled
at
me
from
the
little
cupboard
i
had
made
to
hold
them
a
cupboard
whose
construction
she
had
overlooked
with
a
critical
eye
and
i
must
needs
remember
how
she
had
insisted
on
being
permitted
to
drive
in
three
nails
with
her
own
hand
i
could
put
my
finger
on
those
very
nails
how
she
had
tapped
at
those
nails
for
fear
of
missing
them
how
beautiful
she
had
looked
in
her
coarse
apron
and
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
over
her
round
white
arms
how
womanly
and
sweet
yet
i
had
dared
to
think
had
dared
to
call
her
a
messalina
oh
that
my
tongue
had
withered
or
ever
i
had
coupled
one
so
pure
and
noble
with
a
creature
so
base
and
common
so
thinking
i
sighed
and
went
out
into
the
dawn
as
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
its
hollow
slam
struck
me
sharply
and
i
called
to
mind
how
she
had
called
it
a
bad
and
door
and
indeed
so
it
was
with
dejected
step
and
hanging
head
i
made
my
way
towards
sissinghurst
for
since
i
was
up
i
might
as
well
work
and
there
was
much
to
be
done
and
as
i
went
i
heard
a
distant
clock
chime
four
now
when
i
reached
the
village
the
sun
was
beginning
to
rise
and
thus
lifting
up
my
eyes
i
beheld
one
standing
before
the
bull
a
very
tall
man
much
bigger
and
greater
than
most
a
wild
figure
in
the
dawn
with
matted
hair
and
beard
and
clad
in
tattered
clothes
yet
hair
and
beard
gleamed
a
red
gold
where
the
light
touched
them
and
there
was
but
one
man
i
knew
so
tall
and
so
mighty
as
this
wherefore
i
hurried
towards
him
all
unnoticed
for
his
eyes
were
raised
to
a
certain
latticed
casement
of
the
inn
and
being
come
up
i
reached
out
and
touched
this
man
upon
the
arm
george
said
i
and
held
out
my
hand
he
turned
swiftly
but
seeing
me
started
back
a
pace
staring
george
said
i
again
oh
george
but
george
only
backed
still
farther
passing
his
hand
once
or
twice
across
his
eyes
peter
said
he
at
last
speaking
hardly
above
a
whisper
but
you
dead
peter
dead
i
killed
no
i
answered
you
did
kill
me
george
indeed
i
wish
you
had
you
came
pretty
near
it
but
you
did
quite
manage
it
and
george
i
very
desolate
wo
you
shake
hands
with
a
very
desolate
man
if
you
can
believing
that
i
have
always
been
your
friend
and
a
true
and
loyal
one
then
give
me
your
hand
if
not
if
you
think
me
still
the
despicable
traitor
you
once
did
then
let
us
go
into
the
field
yonder
and
if
you
can
manage
to
knock
me
on
the
head
for
good
and
all
this
time
why
so
much
the
better
come
what
do
you
say
without
a
word
black
george
turned
and
led
the
way
to
a
narrow
lane
a
little
distance
beyond
the
bull
and
from
the
lane
into
a
meadow
being
come
thither
i
took
off
my
coat
and
neckerchief
but
this
time
i
cast
no
look
upon
the
world
about
me
though
indeed
it
was
fair
enough
but
black
george
stood
half
turned
from
me
with
his
fists
clenched
and
his
broad
shoulders
heaving
oddly
peter
said
he
in
his
slow
heavy
way
never
clench
ye
fists
to
me
do
i
ca
abide
it
but
oh
man
peter

i
clasp

george

a
bright
idea

me
if

why

george
turned
to
look
at
me
and
looking
dropped
his
eyes
and
fumbled
with
his
hands
while
up
under
his
tanned
skin
there
crept
a
painful
burning
crimson
peter
said
he
yes
george
i
got
more
to
tell
as
i
never
meant
to
tell
to
a
soul

george
but
not
to

no
he
cried
no
i
could
i
could
abide
to
see
you
an
prue
married

no
i
could
abide
it
and
you

george
prue
loves
a
stronger
a
better
man
than
i
and
she
has
wept
over
him
george
and
prayed
over
him
such
tears
and
prayers
as
surely
might
win
the
blackest
soul
to
heaven
and
has
said
that
she
would
marry
that
man
ah
even
if
he
came
back
with
upon
him
even
then
she
would
marry
him
if
he
would
only
ask
her
oh
peter
cried
george
seizing
my
shoulders
in
a
mighty
grip
and
looking
into
my
eyes
with
tears
in
his
own
oh
man
peter
you
as
knocked
me
down
an
as
i
love
for
it
be
this
true
it
is
god
truth
said
i
and
look
there
is
a
sign
to
prove
i
am
no
liar
look
and
i
pointed
towards
the
bull
george
turned
and
i
felt
his
fingers
tighten
suddenly
for
there
at
the
open
doorway
of
the
inn
with
the
early
glory
of
the
morning
all
about
her
stood
prue
as
we
watched
she
began
to
cross
the
road
towards
the
smithy
with
laggard
step
and
drooping
head
do
you
know
where
she
is
going
george
i
can
tell
you
she
is
going
to
your
smithy
to
pray
for
you
do
you
hear
to
pray
for
you
come
and
i
seized
his
arm
no
peter
no
i
durst
i
could
but
he
suffered
me
to
lead
him
forward
nevertheless
once
he
stopped
and
glanced
round
but
the
village
was
asleep
about
us
and
so
we
presently
came
to
the
open
doorway
of
the
forge
and
behold
prue
was
kneeling
before
the
anvil
with
her
face
hidden
in
her
arms
and
her
slender
body
swaying
slightly
but
all
at
once
as
if
she
felt
him
near
her
she
raised
her
head
and
saw
him
and
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
glad
cry
and
as
she
stood
george
went
to
her
and
knelt
at
her
feet
and
raising
the
hem
of
her
gown
stooped
and
kissed
it
oh
my
sweet
maid
said
he
oh
my
sweet
prue
i
bea
worthy
i
bea
but
she
caught
the
great
shaggy
head
to
her
bosom
and
stifled
it
there
and
in
her
face
was
a
radiance
a
happiness
beyond
words
and
the
strong
arms
clung
close
about
her
so
i
turned
and
left
them
in
paradise
together
chapter
xxxvi
which
sympathizes
with
a
brass
jack
a
brace
of
cutlasses
and
divers
pots
and
pans
i
found
the
ancient
sunning
himself
in
the
porch
before
the
inn
as
he
waited
for
his
breakfast
peter
said
he
i

and
very
lusty
and
strong

you
said
you
would
the
question
we
axes
is
wheer
be
jarge
ah
wheer
nodded
job
gloomily
here
the
ancient
was
evidently
at
a
loss
to
cover
which
he
took
a
vast
pinch
of
snuff
be
we
to
know
as
bea
pinin
away
in
a
dungeon
cell
wi
irons
on
legs
an
strapped
in
a
straitjacket
an
old
amos
stopped
and
staring
for
out
from
the
gloom
of
the
smithy
issued
black
george
himself
with
prue
upon
his
arm
the
ancient
stared
also
but
dissembling
his
vast
surprise
he
dealt
the
lid
of
his
snuffbox
two
loud
triumphant
knocks
peter
said
he
rising
stiffly
peter
lad
i
were
beginnin
to
think
as
jarge
were
never
comin
in
to
breakfus
at
all
i
waited
and
waited
till
i
be
so
ravenous
as
a
lion
an
tiger
but
be
at
last
peter
be
so
let
go
in
an
eat
saying
which
he
turned
his
back
upon
his
discomfited
tormentors
and
led
me
into
the
kitchen
of
the
inn
and
there
were
the
maids
setting
forth
such
a
breakfast
as
only
such
a
kitchen
could
produce
and
presently
there
was
prue
herself
with
george
hanging
back
something
shamefaced
till
the
ancient
had
hobbled
forward
to
give
him
welcome
and
there
was
honest
simon
all
wonderment
and
hearty
greeting
and
last
but
by
no
means
least
there
were
the
battered
cutlasses
the
brass
jack
and
the
glittering
pots
and
pans
glittering
and
gleaming
and
twinkling
a
greeting
likewise
and
with
all
their
might
ah
but
they
little
guessed
why
prue
eyes
were
so
shy
and
sweet
or
why
the
color
came
and
went
in
her
pretty
cheeks
little
they
guessed
why
this
giant
trod
so
lightly
and
held
his
tall
head
so
very
high
little
they
dreamed
of
the
situation
as
yet
had
they
done
so
surely
they
must
one
and
all
have
fallen
upon
that
curly
golden
head
and
buried
it
beneath
their
gleaming
glittering
twinkling
jealousy
and
what
a
meal
was
that
with
those
deft
whitecapped
maids
to
wait
upon
our
wants
and
with
prudence
hovering
here
and
there
to
see
that
all
were
duly
served
and
refusing
to
sit
down
until
george
great
arm
a
very
gentle
arm
for
one
so
strong
and
big
drew
her
down
beside
him
yes
truly
what
a
meal
that
was
and
how
the
ancient
chuckled
and
dug
me
with
one
bony
elbow
and
george
with
the
other
and
chuckled
again
till
he
choked
and
choked
till
he
gasped
and
gasped
till
he
had
us
all
upon
our
feet
then
demanded
indignantly
why
we
could
let
him
hisself
in
peace
and
now
when
the
meal
was
nearly
over
he
suddenly
took
it
into
his
head
that
prue
did
love
george
as
she
should
and
as
he
deserved
to
be
and
nothing
would
content
him
but
that
she
must
kiss
him
then
and
there
an
not
on
the
mind
nor
on
the
cheek
but
on
the
place
as
god
made
for
it
the
mouth
my
lass
and
now
who
so
shy
and
blushing
as
prue
and
who
so
nervous
for
her
sake
as
black
george
very
evidently
clasping
her
hand
under
the
table
and
bidding
her
never
to
mind
as
he
was
content
and
never
to
put
herself
out
over
such
as
him
whereupon
mistress
prue
must
needs
turn
and
taking
his
head
between
her
hands
kissed
him
not
once
or
twice
but
three
times
and
upon
the
place
god
made
for
it
the
mouth
o
gleaming
cutlasses
o
great

glittering
pots
and
pans
can
ye
any
longer
gleam
and
glitter
and
twinkle
in

alas
i
trow
not
therefore
it
is
only
natural
and
to
be
expected
that
beneath
your
outward
polish
lurk
black

bitter
feelings
against
this
giant
and
a
bloodthirsty
desire
for
vengeance
if
so
then
one
and
all
of
you
have
at

the
good
feeling
not

worthy

chapter
xxxvii
the
preacher
it
is
a
wise
and
to
some
extent
a
true
saying
that
hard
work
is
an
antidote
to
sorrow
a
panacea
for
all
trouble
but
when
the
labor
is
over
and
done
when
the
tools
are
set
by
and
the
weary
worker
goes
forth
into
the
quiet
evening
how
then
for
we
can
not
always
work
and
sooner
or
later
comes
the
still
hour
when
memory
rushes
in
upon
us
again
and
sorrow
and
remorse
sit
dark
and
gloomy
on
either
hand
a
week
dragged
by
a
season
of
alternate
hope
and
black
despair
a
restless
fever
of
nights
and
days
for
with
each
dawn
came
hope
that
lived
awhile
beside
me
only
to
fly
away
with
the
sun
and
leave
me
to
despair
i
hungered
for
the
sound
of
charmian
voice
for
the
quick
light
fall
of
her
foot
for
the
least
touch
of
her
hand
i
became
more
and
more
possessed
of
a
morbid
fancy
that
she
might
be
existing
near
by
could
i
but
find
her
that
she
had
passed
along
the
road
only
a
little
while
before
me
or
at
this
very
moment
might
be
approaching
might
be
within
sight
were
i
but
quick
enough
often
at
such
times
i
would
fling
down
my
hammer
or
tongs
to
surprise
and
hurrying
to
the
door
stare
up
and
down
the
road
or
pause
in
my
hammerstrokes
fiercely
bidding
george
do
the
same
fancying
i
heard
her
voice
calling
to
me
from
a
distance
and
george
would
watch
me
with
a
troubled
brow
but
with
a
rare
delicacy
say
no
word
indeed
the
thought
of
charmian
was
with
me
everywhere
the
ringing
hammers
mocked
me
with
her
praises
the
bellows
sang
of
her
beauty
the
trees
whispered
charmian
charmian
and
charmian
was
in
the
very
air
but
when
i
had
reluctantly
bidden
george
good
night
and
set
out
along
lanes
full
of
the
fragrant
dusk
of
evening
when
reaching
the
hollow
i
followed
that
leafy
path
beside
the
brook
which
she
and
i
had
so
often
trodden
together
when
i
sat
in
my
gloomy
disordered
cottage
with
the
deep
silence
unbroken
save
for
the
plaintive
murmur
of
the
brook
then
indeed
my
loneliness
was
more
than
i
could
bear
there
were
dark
hours
when
the
cottage
rang
with
strange
sounds
when
i
would
lie
face
down
upon
the
floor
clutching
my
throbbing
temples
between
my
palms
fearful
of
myself
and
dreading
the
oncoming
horror
of
madness
it
was
at
this
time
too
that
i
began
to
be
haunted
by
the
thing
above
the
door
the
rusty
staple
upon
which
a
man
had
choked
out
his
wretched
life
sixty
and
six
years
ago
a
wanderer
a
lonely
man
perhaps
acquainted
with
misery
or
haunted
by
remorse
one
who
had
suffered
much
and
long
even
as
i
but
who
had
eventually
escaped
it
all
even
as
i
might
do
thus
i
would
sit
chin
in
hand
staring
up
at
this
staple
until
the
light
failed
and
sometimes
in
the
dead
of
night
i
would
steal
softly
there
to
touch
it
with
my
finger
looking
back
on
all
this
it
seems
that
i
came
very
near
losing
my
reason
for
i
had
then
by
no
means
recovered
from
black
george
fist
and
indeed
even
now
i
am
at
times
not
wholly
free
from
its
effect
my
sleep
too
was
often
broken
and
troubled
with
wild
dreams
so
that
bed
became
a
place
of
horror
and
rising
i
would
sit
before
the
empty
hearth
a
candle
guttering
at
my
elbow
and
think
of
charmian
until
i
would
fancy
i
heard
the
rustle
of
her
garments
behind
me
and
start
up
trembling
and
breathless
at
such
times
the
tap
of
a
blown
leaf
against
the
lattice
would
fill
me
with
a
fever
of
hope
and
expectation
often
and
often
her
soft
laugh
stole
to
me
in
the
gurgle
of
the
brook
and
she
would
call
to
me
in
the
deep
night
silences
in
a
voice
very
sweet
and
faint
and
far
away
then
i
would
plunge
out
into
the
dark
and
lift
my
hands
to
the
stars
that
winked
upon
my
agony
and
journey
on
through
a
desolate
world
to
return
with
the
dawn
weary
and
despondent
it
was
after
one
of
these
wild
night
expeditions
that
i
sat
beneath
a
tree
watching
the
sunrise
and
yet
i
think
i
must
have
dozed
for
i
was
startled
by
a
voice
close
above
me
and
glancing
up
i
recognized
the
little
preacher
as
our
eyes
met
he
immediately
took
the
pipe
from
his
lips
and
made
as
though
to
cram
it
into
his
pocket
though
indeed
it
is
empty
he
explained
as
though
i
had
spoken
old
habits
cling
to
one
young
sir
and
my
pipe
here
has
been
the
friend
of
my
solitude
these
many
years
and
i
can
not
bear
to
turn
my
back
upon
it
yet
so
i
carry
it
with
me
still
and
sometimes
when
at
all
thoughtful
i
find
it
between
my
lips
but
though
the
flesh
as
you
see
is
very
weak
i
hope
in
time
to
forego
even
this
and
he
sighed
shaking
his
head
in
gentle
deprecation
of
himself
but
you
look
pale
haggard
he
went
on
you
are
ill
young
sir
no
no
said
i
springing
to
my
feet
look
at
this
arm
is
it
the
arm
of
a
sick
man
no
no
i
am
well
enough
but
what
of
him
we
found
in
the
ditch
you
and
i
the
miserable
creature
who
lay
bubbling
in
the
grass
he
has
been
very
near
death
sir
indeed
his
days
are
numbered
i
think
yet
he
is
better
for
the
time
being
and
last
night
declared
his
intention
of
leaving
the
shelter
of
my
humble
roof
and
setting
forth
upon
his
mission
his
mission
sir
he
speaks
of
himself
as
one
chosen
by
god
to
work
his
will
and
asks
but
to
live
until
this
mission
whatever
it
is
be
accomplished
a
strange
being
said
the
little
preacher
puffing
at
his
empty
pipe
again
as
we
walked
on
side
by
side
a
dark
incomprehensible
man
and
a
very
very
wretched
one
poor
soul
wretched
said
i
is
not
that
our
human
lot
is
born
to
sorrow
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
and
job
was
accounted
wise
in
his
generation
that
was
a
cry
from
the
depths
of
despond
but
job
stood
at
last
upon
the
heights
and
felt
once
more
god
blessed
sun
and
rejoiced
even
as
we
should
but
as
regards
this
stranger
he
is
one
who
would
seem
to
have
suffered
some
great
wrong
the
continued
thought
of
which
has
unhinged
his
mind
his
heart
seems
broken
dead
i
have
sitting
beside
his
delirious
couch
heard
him
babble
a
terrible
indictment
against
some
man
i
have
also
heard
him
pray
and
his
prayers
have
been
all
for
vengeance
poor
fellow
said
i
it
were
better
we
had
left
him
to
die
in
his
ditch
for
if
death
does
not
bring
oblivion
it
may
bring
a
change
of
scene
sir
said
the
preacher
laying
his
hand
upon
my
arm
such
bitterness
in
one
so
young
is
unnatural
you
are
in
some
trouble
i
would
that
i
might
aid
you
be
your
friend
know
you
better
oh
sir
that
is
easily
done
i
am
a
blacksmith
hardworking
sober
and
useful
to
my
fellows
they
call
me
peter
smith
a
certain
time
since
i
was
a
useless
dreamer
spending
more
money
in
a
week
than
i
now
earn
in
a
year
and
getting
very
little
for
it
i
was
studious
egotistical
and
pedantic
wasting
my
time
upon
impossible
translations
that
nobody
wanted
and
they
knew
me
as
peter
vibart
vibart
exclaimed
the
preacher
starting
and
looking
up
at
me
vibart
i
nodded
related
in
any
way
to
sir
maurice
vibart
his
cousin
sir
my
companion
appeared
lost
in
thought
for
he
was
puffing
at
his
empty
pipe
again
do
you
happen
to
know
sir
maurice
i
inquired
no
returned
the
preacher
no
sir
but
i
have
heard
mention
of
him
and
lately
though
just
when
or
where
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
recall
why
the
name
is
familiar
to
a
great
many
people
said
i
you
see
he
is
rather
a
famous
character
in
his
way
talking
thus
we
presently
reached
a
stile
beyond
which
the
footpath
led
away
through
swaying
corn
and
by
shady
hopgarden
to
sissinghurst
village
here
the
preacher
stopped
and
gave
me
his
hand
but
i
noticed
he
still
puffed
at
his
pipe
and
you
are
now
a
blacksmith
and
mightily
content
so
to
be
you
are
a
most
strange
young
man
said
the
preacher
shaking
his
head
many
people
have
told
me
the
same
sir
said
i
and
vaulted
over
the
stile
yet
turning
back
when
i
had
gone
some
way
i
saw
him
leaning
where
i
had
left
him
and
with
his
pipe
still
in
his
mouth
chapter
xxxviii
in
which
i
meet
my
cousin
sir
maurice
vibart
as
i
approached
the
smithy
late
though
the
hour
was
and
george
made
it
a
rule
to
have
the
fire
going
by
six
every
morning
no
sound
of
hammer
reached
me
and
coming
into
the
place
i
found
it
empty
then
i
remembered
that
george
was
to
drive
over
to
tonbridge
with
prudence
and
the
ancient
to
invest
in
certain
household
necessities
for
in
a
month
time
they
were
to
be
married
hereupon
i
must
needs
contrast
george
happy
future
with
my
dreary
one
and
fall
bitterly
to
cursing
myself
and
sitting
on
the
stool
in
the
corner
i
covered
my
face
and
my
thoughts
were
very
black
now
presently
as
i
sat
thus
i
became
conscious
of
a
very
delicate
perfume
in
the
air
and
also
that
some
one
had
entered
quietly
my
breath
caught
in
my
throat
but
i
did
not
at
once
look
up
fearing
to
dispel
the
hope
that
tingled
within
me
so
i
remained
with
my
face
still
covered
until
something
touched
me
and
i
saw
that
it
was
the
handle
of
a
whip
wherefore
i
raised
my
head
suddenly
and
glanced
up
then
i
beheld
a
radiant
vision
in
polished
and
speckless
moleskins
in
handsome
flowered
waistcoat
and
coat
with
snowy
frills
at
throat
and
wrists
a
tall
gallant
figure
of
a
graceful
easy
bearing
who
stood
a
picture
of
cool
gentlemanly
insolence
tapping
his
boot
lightly
with
his
whip
but
as
his
eye
met
mine
the
tapping
whip
grew
suddenly
still
his
languid
expression
vanished
he
came
a
quick
step
nearer
and
bent
his
face
nearer
my
own
a
dark
face
handsome
in
its
way
pale
and
aquiline
with
a
powerful
jaw
and
dominating
eyes
and
mouth
a
face
nay
a
mask
rather
that
smiled
and
smiled
but
never
showed
the
man
beneath
now
glancing
up
at
his
brow
i
saw
there
a
small
newly
healed
scar
is
it
possible
said
he
speaking
in
that
softly
modulated
voice
i
remembered
to
have
heard
once
before
can
it
be
possible
that
i
address
my
worthy
cousin
that
shirt
that
utterly
impossible
coat
and
belcher
and
yet
the
likeness
is
remarkable
have
i
the
honor
to
address
peter
vibart
late
of
oxford
the
same
sir
i
answered
rising
then
most
worthy
cousin
i
salute
you
and
he
removed
his
hat
bowing
with
an
ironic
grace
believe
me
i
have
frequently
desired
to
see
that
paragon
of
all
the
virtues
whose
dutiful
respect
our
revered
uncle
rewarded
with
the
proverbial
shilling
egad
he
went
on
examining
me
through
his
glass
with
a
great
show
of
interest
had
you
been
any
other
than
that
same
virtuous
cousin
peter
whose
graces
and
perfections
were
forever
being
thrown
at
my
head
i
could
have
sympathized
with
you
positively
if
only
on
account
of
that
most
obnoxious
coat
and
belcher
and
the
grime
and
sootiness
of
things
in
general
poof
he
exclaimed
pressing
his
perfumed
handkerchief
to
his
nostrils
faugh
how
damnably
you
do
keep
yourself
cousin
oh
gad
you
would
certainly
find
it
much
clearer
outside
said
i
beginning
to
blow
up
the
fire
but
then
cousin
peter
outside
one
must
become
a
target
for
the
yokel
eye
and
i
detest
being
stared
at
by
the
uneducated
who
naturally
lack
appreciation
on
the
whole
i
prefer
the
smoke
though
it
chokes
one
most
infernally
where
may
one
venture
to
sit
here
i
tendered
him
the
stool
but
he
shook
his
head
and
crossing
to
the
anvil
flicked
it
daintily
with
his
handkerchief
and
sat
down
dangling
his
leg
my
soul
said
he
eyeing
me
languidly
through
his
glass
again
my
soul
you
are
damnably
like
me
you
know
in
features
damnably
i
nodded
he
glanced
at
me
sharply
and
laughed
my
man
a
creature
of
the
name
of
parks
said
he
swinging
his
spurred
boot
to
and
fro
led
me
to
suppose
that
i
should
meet
a
person
here
a
blacksmith
fellow
your
man
parks
informed
you
correctly
i
nodded
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
devil
exclaimed
sir
maurice
shaking
his
head
but
no
you
are
as
i
gather
somewhat
eccentric
but
even
you
would
never
take
such
a
desperate
step
as
to
to
become
a
blacksmith
fellow
i
put
in
precisely
alas
sir
maurice
i
blush
to
say
that
rather
than
become
an
unprincipled
adventurer
living
on
my
wits
or
a
fawning
upon
acquaintances
for
a
livelihood
or
doing
anything
rather
than
soil
my
hands
with
honest
toil
i
became
a
blacksmith
fellow
some
four
or
five
months
ago
really
it
is
most
distressing
to
observe
to
what
depths
virtue
may
drag
a
man
you
are
a
very
monster
of
probity
and
rectitude
exclaimed
sir
maurice
indeed
i
am
astonished
you
manifested
not
only
shocking
bad
judgment
but
a
most
deplorable
lack
of
thought
virtue
is
damnably
selfish
as
a
rule
really
it
is
quite
disconcerting
to
find
one
self
first
cousin
to
a
blacksmith
fellow
i
added
fellow
nodded
sir
maurice
oh
the
devil
to
think
of
my
worthy
cousin
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
laboring
with
hammer
and
saw
not
a
saw
i
put
in
we
will
say
chisel
then
a
vibart
with
hammer
and
chisel
deuce
take
me
most
distressing
and
you
will
pardon
my
saying
so
you
do
not
seem
to
thrive
on
hammers
and
chisels
no
one
could
say
you
looked
blooming
or
even
flourishing
like
the
young
bay
tree
which
is
i
fancy
an
eastern
expression
sir
said
i
may
i
remind
you
that
i
have
work
to
do
a
deuced
interesting
place
though
this
he
smiled
staring
round
imperturbably
through
his
glass
so
er
so
devilish
grimy
and
smutty
and
gritty
quite
a
number
of
horseshoes
too
d
know
cousin
i
never
before
remarked
what
a
number
of
holes
there
are
in
a
horseshoe
but
live
and
learn
here
he
paused
to
inhale
a
pinch
of
snuff
very
daintily
from
a
jewelled
box
it
is
a
strange
thing
he
pursued
as
he
dusted
his
fingers
on
his
handkerchief
a
very
strange
thing
that
being
cousins
we
have
never
met
till
now
especially
as
i
have
heard
so
very
much
about
you
pray
said
i
pray
how
should
you
hear
about
one
so
very
insignificant
as
myself
oh
i
have
heard
of
good
cousin
peter
since
i
was
an
imp
of
a
boy
he
smiled
cousin
peter
was
my
chart
whereby
to
steer
through
the
shoals
of
boyish
mischief
into
the
haven
of
our
uncle
george
good
graces
oh
i
have
heard
over
much
of
you
cousin
from
dear
kind
relatives
and
friends
damn
they
rang
your
praises
in
my
ears
morning
noon
and
night
and
why
simply
that
i
might
come
to
surpass
you
in
virtue
learning
wit
and
appearance
and
so
win
our
uncle
george
regard
and
incidentally
his
legacy
but
i
was
a
young
demon
romping
with
the
grooms
in
the
stable
while
you
were
a
young
angel
in
nankeens
passing
studious
hours
with
your
books
when
i
was
a
scapegrace
at
harrow
you
were
winning
golden
opinions
at
eton
when
you
were
an
man
at
oxford
i
was
at
cambridge
naturally
enough
perhaps
i
grew
sick
of
the
name
of
peter
and
indeed
it
smacks
damnably
of
fish
do
you
think
you
or
your
name
crossed
me
at
every
turn
if
it
was
for
cousin
peter
i
was
heir
to
ten
thousand
a
year
but
good
cousin
peter
was
so
fond
of
uncle
george
and
uncle
george
was
so
fond
of
good
cousin
peter
that
maurice
might
go
hang
for
a
graceless
dog
and
be
damned
to
him
you
have
my
deepest
sympathy
and
apologies
said
i
still
i
have
sometimes
been
curious
to
meet
worthy
cousin
peter
and
it
is
rather
surprising
that
i
have
never
done
so
on
the
contrary
i
began
but
his
laugh
stopped
me
ah
to
be
sure
he
nodded
our
ways
have
lain
widely
separate
hitherto
you
a
scholar
treading
the
difficult
path
of
learning
i
oh
egad
a
terrible
fellow
a
mauvais
sujet
a
sad
sad
dog
but
after
all
cousin
when
one
comes
to
look
at
you
you
might
stand
for
a
terrible
example
of
virtue
run
riot
a
distressing
spectacle
of
dutiful
respect
and
good
precedent
cut
off
with
a
shilling
really
it
is
horrifying
to
observe
to
what
depths
virtue
may
plunge
an
otherwise
individual
little
dreamed
those
dear
kind
relatives
and
friends
damn
that
while
the
wilful
maurice
lived
on
continually
getting
into
hot
water
and
out
again
up
to
his
eyes
in
debt
and
pretty
well
esteemed
the
virtuous
pattern
peter
would
descend
to
a
hammer
and
saw
i
should
say
chisel
in
a
very
grimy
place
where
he
is
it
seems
the
presiding
genius
indeed
this
first
meeting
of
ours
under
these
circumstances
is
somewhat
dramatic
as
it
should
be
and
yet
we
have
met
before
said
i
and
the
circumstances
were
then
even
more
dramatic
perhaps
we
met
in
a
tempest
sir
ha
he
exclaimed
dwelling
on
the
word
and
speaking
very
slowly
a
tempest
cousin
there
was
much
wind
and
rain
and
it
was
very
dark
dark
cousin
but
i
saw
your
face
very
plainly
as
you
lay
on
your
back
sir
by
the
aid
of
a
postilion
lanthorn
and
was
greatly
struck
by
our
mutual
resemblance
sir
maurice
raised
his
glass
and
looked
at
me
and
as
he
looked
smiled
but
he
could
not
hide
the
sudden
passionate
quiver
of
his
thin
nostrils
or
the
gleam
of
the
eyes
beneath
their
languid
lids
he
rose
slowly
and
paced
to
the
door
when
he
came
back
again
he
was
laughing
softly
but
still
he
could
not
hide
the
quiver
of
his
nostrils
or
the
gleam
of
the
eyes
beneath
their
languid
lids
so
it
was
you
he
murmured
with
a
pause
between
the
words
oh
was
ever
anything
so
damnably
contrary
to
think
that
i
should
hunt
her
into
your
very
arms
to
think
that
of
all
men
in
the
world
it
should
be
you
to
play
the
squire
of
dames
and
he
laughed
again
but
as
he
did
so
the
stout
snapped
in
his
hands
like
a
straw
he
glanced
down
at
the
broken
pieces
and
from
them
to
me
you
see
i
am
rather
strong
in
the
hands
cousin
said
he
shaking
his
head
but
i
was
not
quite
strong
enough
last
time
we
met
though
to
be
sure
as
you
say
it
was
very
dark
had
i
known
it
was
worthy
cousin
throat
i
grasped
i
think
i
might
have
squeezed
it
just
a
little
tighter
sir
said
i
shaking
my
head
i
really
do
think
you
could
have
done
it
yes
he
sighed
tossing
his
broken
whip
into
a
corner
yes
i
think
so
you
see
i
mistook
you
for
merely
an
interfering
country
bumpkin
yes
i
nodded
while
i
on
the
other
hand
took
you
for
a
fine
gentleman
nobly
intent
on
the
ruin
of
an
unfortunate
friendless
girl
whose
poverty
would
seem
to
make
her
an
easy
victim
in
which
it
appears
you
were
as
much
mistaken
as
i
cousin
peter
here
he
glanced
at
me
with
a
sudden
keenness
indeed
why
surely
said
he
surely
you
must
know
he
paused
to
flick
a
speck
of
soot
from
his
knee
and
then
continued
did
she
tell
you
nothing
of
herself
very
little
beside
her
name
ah
she
told
you
her
name
then
yes
she
told
me
her
name
well
cousin
well
sir
we
had
both
risen
and
now
fronted
each
other
across
the
anvil
sir
maurice
debonair
and
smiling
while
i
stood
frowning
and
gloomy
come
said
i
at
last
let
us
understand
each
other
once
for
all
you
tell
me
that
you
have
always
looked
upon
me
as
your
rival
for
our
uncle
good
graces
i
never
was
you
have
deceived
yourself
into
believing
that
because
i
was
his
ward
that
alone
augmented
my
chances
of
becoming
the
heir
it
never
did
he
saw
me
as
seldom
as
possible
and
if
he
ever
troubled
his
head
about
either
of
us
it
would
seem
that
he
favored
you
i
tell
you
i
never
was
your
rival
in
the
past
and
never
shall
be
in
the
future
meaning
cousin
meaning
sir
in
regard
to
either
the
legacy
or
the
lady
sophia
sefton
i
was
never
fond
enough
of
money
to
marry
for
it
i
have
never
seen
this
lady
nor
do
i
propose
to
thus
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
are
free
to
win
her
and
the
fortune
as
soon
as
you
will
i
as
you
see
prefer
horseshoes
and
what
said
sir
maurice
flicking
a
speck
of
soot
from
his
cuff
and
immediately
looking
at
me
again
what
of
charmian
i
do
know
i
answered
nor
should
i
be
likely
to
tell
you
if
i
did
wherever
she
may
be
she
is
safe
i
trust
and
beyond
your
reach
no
he
broke
in
she
will
never
be
beyond
my
reach
until
she
is
dead
or
i
am
perhaps
not
even
then
and
i
shall
find
her
again
sooner
or
later
depend
upon
it
yes
you
may
depend
upon
that
cousin
maurice
said
i
reaching
out
my
hand
to
him
wherever
she
may
be
she
is
alone
and
unprotected
pursue
her
no
farther
go
back
to
london
marry
your
lady
sefton
inherit
your
fortune
but
leave
charmian
brown
in
peace
and
pray
said
he
frowning
suddenly
whence
this
solicitude
on
her
behalf
what
is
she
to
you
this
charmian
brown
nothing
i
answered
hurriedly
nothing
at
all
god
knows
nor
ever
can
be
sir
maurice
leaned
suddenly
forward
and
catching
me
by
the
shoulder
peered
into
my
face
by
heaven
he
exclaimed
the
fellow
actually
loves
her
well
said
i
meeting
his
look
why
not
yes
i
love
her
a
very
fury
of
rage
seemed
suddenly
to
possess
him
the
languid
smiling
gentleman
became
a
devil
with
vicious
eyes
and
evil
snarling
mouth
whose
fingers
sank
into
my
flesh
as
he
swung
me
back
and
forth
in
a
powerful
grip
you
love
her
you
you
he
panted
yes
i
answered
flinging
him
off
so
that
he
staggered
yes
yes
i
who
fought
for
her
once
and
am
willing
most
willing
to
do
so
again
now
or
at
any
other
time
for
though
i
hold
no
hope
of
winning
her
ever
yet
i
can
serve
her
still
and
protect
her
from
the
pollution
of
your
presence
and
i
clenched
my
fists
he
stood
poised
as
though
about
to
spring
at
me
and
i
saw
his
knuckles
gleam
whiter
than
the
laces
above
them
but
all
at
once
he
laughed
lightly
easily
as
ever
a
very
perfect
gentle
knight
he
murmured
sans
peur
et
sans
reproche
though
somewhat
grimy
and
in
a
leather
apron
chivalry
kneeling
amid
hammers
and
horseshoes
worshiping
her
with
a
reverence
distant
and
lowly
how
like
you
worthy
cousin
how
very
like
you
and
how
affecting
but
and
here
his
nostrils
quivered
again
but
i
tell
you
she
is
mine
mine
and
always
has
been
and
no
man
living
shall
come
between
us
no
by
god
that
said
i
that
remains
to
be
seen
ha
though
indeed
i
think
she
is
safe
from
you
while
i
live
but
then
cousin
peter
life
is
a
very
uncertain
thing
at
best
he
returned
glancing
at
me
beneath
his
drooping
lids
yes
i
nodded
it
is
sometimes
a
blessing
to
remember
that
sir
maurice
strolled
to
the
door
and
being
there
paused
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
i
go
to
find
charmian
said
he
and
i
shall
find
her
sooner
or
later
and
when
i
do
should
you
take
it
upon
yourself
to
come
between
us
again
or
presume
to
interfere
again
i
shall
kill
you
worthy
cousin
without
the
least
compunction
if
you
think
this
sufficient
warning
act
upon
it
if
not
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
significantly
farewell
good
and
worthy
cousin
peter
farewell
or
shall
we
say
revoir
chapter
xxxix
how
i
went
down
into
the
shadows
peter
said
george
one
evening
turning
to
me
with
the
troubled
look
i
had
seen
so
often
on
his
face
of
late
what
be
wrong
wi
you
my
chap
you
be
growing
paler
everyday
oh
peter
you
be
like
a
man
as
is
dyin
by
inches
if
is
any
o
my
doin
nonsense
george
i
broke
in
with
sudden
asperity
i
am
well
enough
yet
i
seen
your
fall
sometimes
peter
all
at
once
an
you
missed
your
stroke
yesterday
come
square
down
on
anvil
you
ca
ha
forgot
i
remember
i
muttered
i
remember
an
twice
again
an
you
be
silent
peter
an
do
seem
to
when
spoke
to
an
short
in
your
temper
oh
you
bea
the
man
you
was
i
see
it
on
you
more
an
more
oh
man
peter
he
cried
turning
his
back
upon
me
suddenly
you
as
i
let
walk
over
me
you
as
i
be
cut
in
pieces
for
if
it
be
me
as
done
it
no
no
george
it
was
you
of
course
not
if
i
am
a
little
strange
it
is
probably
due
to
lack
of
sleep
nothing
more
ye
see
peter
i
tried
so
to
kill
an
you
said
yourself
as
i
come
nigh

it
but
then
you
did
quite
manage
it
i
cried
harshly

to
god

as
it

i
am
alive
and
there
an
end
of
it
a
woundy
blow

the
same
since
it
be
all
my
doin
i
know
it
i
know
it
and
sinking
upon
the
ancient
stool
in
the
corner
black
george
covered
his
face
never
think
of
it
george
i
said
laying
my
arm
across
his
heaving
shoulders
that
is
all
over
and
done
with
dear
fellow
and
i
would
not
have
it
otherwise
since
it
gained
me
your
friendship
i
am
all
right
well
and
strong
it
is
only
sleep
that
i
need
george
only
sleep
upon
the
still
evening
air
rose
the
sharp
tap
tap
of
the
stick
whereat
up
started
the
smith
and
coming
to
the
forge
began
raking
out
the
fire
with
great
dust
and
clatter
as
the
old
man
hobbled
up
saluting
us
cheerily
as
he
came
lord
he
exclaimed
pausing
in
the
doorway
to
lean
upon
his
stick
and
glance
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
his
quick
bright
eyes
lord
theer
bea
two
other
such
fine
chaps
in
all
the
south
country
as
you
two
chaps
be
no
nor
such
smiths
it
du
warm
my
old
to
look
at
puts
me
in
mind
o
what
i
were
myself
ages
an
ages
ago
i
were
quite
so
tall
as
jarge
by
about
say
but
then
i
were
wider
wider
ah
a
sight
wider
in
the
shoulder
an
so
strong
as
four
bulls
an
wi
eyes
big
an
sharp
an
piercin
like
peter
only
peter
bea
quite
so
sharp
no
nor
yet
so
piercin
an
that
minds
me
as
i
got
noos
for
peter
what
news
said
i
turning
noos
it
be
ah
an
tu
but
first
of
all
peter
i
wants
to
ax
a
question
what
is
it
ancient
why
it
be
this
peter
said
the
old
man
hobbling
nearer
and
peering
up
into
my
face
ever
since
the
time
as
i
went
an
found
ye
i
thought
as
theer
was
strange
about
what
wi
your
soft
voice
an
gentle
ways
an
it
came
on
me
all
at
once
about
three
the
clock
arternoon
as
you
might
be
a
dook
in
disguise
peter
come
now
be
ye
a
dook
or
bea
ye
yes
or
ne
peter
and
he
fixed
me
with
his
eye
no
ancient
i
answered
smiling
i
no
duke
ah
well
a
earl
then
nor
an
earl
a
barrynet
not
even
a
baronet
ah
said
the
old
man
eyeing
me
doubtfully
i
often
thought
as
you
might
be
one
or
t
other
of
since
three
o
the
clock
arternoon
why
so
why
that
the
that
the
very
noos
as
i
got
to
tell
chuckled
the
ancient
as
he
seated
himself
in
the
corner
you
must
know
then
he
began
with
an
impressive
rap
on
the
lid
of
his
snuffbox
three
arternoon
i
were
sittin
on
the
stile
by
simon
field
when
along
the
road
comes
a
lady
an
an
as
fine
as
fine
could
be
of
a
an
wi
a
servant
ridin
another
as
she
comes
up
she
gives
me
a
look
out
o
eyes
soft
they
was
an
dark
an
up
i
gets
to
touch
my
all
at
once
she
smiles
at
me
an
smile
were
as
sweet
an
gentle
as
eyes
an
she
pulls
up
you
must
be
the
ancient
says
she
so
peter
calls
me
my
leddy
says
i
is
peter
she
says
is
peter
says
she
an
says
i
well
an
sleeps

i

an
legs

strong
an
are
afeared
nobody
like
a
young
lion

peter
says
i
now
while
i
this
she
looks
at
me
soft
an
an
takes
out
a
little
book
an
begins
to
write
in
it
pretty
black
brows
over
it
an
to
an
presently
she
tears
out
what
she

an
gives
it
to
me

to
peter

she
i

my
leddy

i
says
she
smilin
again
an
out
to
me
which
i
kisses

she

now
why
peter
is
so
fond
of
you

think
i
could
be
very
fond
of
tu
says
she
an
so
she
turns
an
the
servant
turns
an
off
they
go
peter
be
the
letter
saying
which
the
ancient
took
a
slip
of
paper
from
the
cavernous
interior
of
his
hat
and
tendered
it
to
me
with
my
head
in
a
whirl
i
crossed
to
the
door
and
leaned
there
awhile
staring
sightlessly
out
into
the
summer
evening
for
it
seemed
that
in
this
little
slip
of
paper
lay
that
which
meant
life
or
death
to
me
so
for
a
long
minute
i
leaned
there
fearing
to
learn
my
fate
then
i
opened
the
little
folded
square
of
paper
and
holding
it
before
my
eyes
read
charmian
brown
presents
this
scratched
out
while
you
busied
yourself
forging
horseshoes
your
cousin
sir
maurice
sought
and
found
me
i
do
not
love
him
but
charmian
farewell
this
also
scored
out
again
i
stared
before
me
with
unseeing
eyes
but
my
hands
no
longer
trembled
nor
did
i
fear
any
more
the
prisoner
had
received
his
sentence
and
suspense
was
at
an
end
and
all
at
once
i
laughed
and
tore
the
paper
across
and
laughed
and
laughed
till
george
and
the
ancient
came
to
stare
at
me
do
cried
the
old
man
do
peter
you
be
like
a
laughin
do
but
the
laugh
still
shook
me
while
i
tore
and
tore
at
the
paper
and
so
let
the
pieces
drop
and
flutter
from
my
fingers
there
said
i
there
goes
a
fool
dream
see
how
it
scatters
a
little
here
a
little
there
but
so
long
as
this
world
lasts
these
pieces
shall
never
come
together
again
so
saying
i
set
off
along
the
road
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
but
when
i
had
gone
some
distance
i
found
that
george
walked
beside
me
and
he
was
very
silent
as
he
walked
and
i
saw
the
trouble
was
back
in
his
eyes
again
george
said
i
stopping
why
do
you
follow
me
i
do
follow
peter
he
answered
i
be
only
wishful
to
walk
wi
you
a
ways
i
in
no
mood
for
company
george
well
i
bea
company
peter
your
friend
i
be
he
said
doggedly
and
without
looking
at
me
yes
said
i
yes
my
good
and
trusty
friend
peter
he
cried
suddenly
laying
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
do
go
back
to
that
theer
ghashly
it
is
the
only
place
in
the
world
for
me
george
and
so
we
went
on
again
side
by
side
through
the
evening
and
spoke
no
more
until
we
had
come
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
down
in
the
hollow
the
shadows
lay
black
and
heavy
and
i
saw
george
shiver
as
he
looked
said
i
clasping
his
hand
george
why
do
say
because
i
am
going
away
goin
away
peter
but
wheer
god
knows
i
answered
but
wherever
it
be
i
shall
carry
with
me
the
memory
of
your
kind
true
heart
and
you
i
think
will
remember
me
it
is
a
blessed
thing
george
to
know
that
howso
far
we
go
a
friend
kind
thoughts
journey
on
with
us
untiring
to
the
end
oh
peter
man
do
go
for
to
leave
me
to
part
is
our
human
lot
george
and
as
well
now
as
later
no
no
he
cried
throwing
his
arm
about
me
not
down
theer
it
be
so
deadly
an
lonely
down
theer
in
the
darkness
come
back
me
just
for
but
i
broke
from
his
detaining
hand
and
plunged
on
down
into
the
shadows
and
presently
turning
my
head
i
saw
him
yet
standing
where
i
had
left
him
looming
gigantic
upon
the
sky
behind
and
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
being
come
at
last
to
the
cottage
i
paused
and
from
that
place
of
shadows
lifted
my
gaze
to
the
luminous
heaven
where
were
a
myriad
eyes
that
seemed
to
watch
me
with
a
new
meaning
wherefore
i
entered
the
cottage
hastily
and
closing
the
door
barred
it
behind
me
then
i
turned
to
peer
up
at
that
which
showed
above
the
door
the
rusty
staple
upon
which
a
man
had
choked
his
life
out
sixty
and
six
years
ago
and
i
began
very
slowly
to
loosen
the
belcher
neckerchief
about
my
throat
peter
cried
a
voice
peter
and
a
hand
was
beating
upon
the
door
chapter
xl
how
in
place
of
death
i
found
the
fulness
of
life
she
came
in
swiftly
closing
the
door
behind
her
found
and
lighted
a
candle
and
setting
it
upon
the
table
between
us
put
back
the
hood
of
her
cloak
and
looked
at
me
while
i
stood
mute
before
her
abashed
by
the
accusation
of
her
eyes
coward
she
said
and
with
the
word
snatched
the
neckerchief
from
my
grasp
and
casting
it
upon
the
floor
set
her
foot
upon
it
coward
said
she
again
yes
i
muttered
yes
i
was
lost
in
a
great
darkness
and
full
of
a
horror
of
coming
nights
and
days
and
so
i
would
have
run
away
from
it
all
like
a
coward
oh
hateful
hateful
she
cried
and
covered
her
face
as
from
some
horror
indeed
you
can
not
despise
me
more
than
i
do
myself
said
i
now
or
ever
i
am
a
failure
in
all
things
except
perhaps
the
making
of
horseshoes
and
this
world
has
no
place
for
failures
and
as
for
horseshoes
fool
she
whispered
oh
fool
that
i
dreamed
so
wise
oh
coward
that
seemed
so
brave
and
strong
oh
man
that
was
so
gloriously
young
and
unspoiled
that
it
should
end
here
that
it
should
come
to
this
and
though
she
kept
her
face
hidden
i
knew
that
she
was
weeping
a
woman
love
transforms
the
man
till
she
sees
him
not
as
he
is
but
as
her
heart
would
have
him
be
the
dross
becomes
pure
gold
and
she
believes
and
believes
until
one
day
her
heart
breaks
charmian
what
what
do
you
mean
oh
are
you
still
so
blind
must
i
tell
you
she
cried
lifting
her
head
proudly
why
did
i
live
beside
you
here
in
the
wilderness
why
did
i
work
for
you
contrive
for
you
and
seek
to
make
this
desolation
a
home
for
you
often
my
heart
cried
out
its
secret
to
you
but
you
never
heard
often
it
trembled
in
my
voice
looked
at
you
from
my
eyes
but
you
never
guessed
oh
blind
blind
and
you
drove
me
from
you
with
shameful
words
but
oh
i
came
back
to
you
and
now
i
know
you
for
but
common
clay
after
all
and
even
yet
she
stopped
suddenly
and
once
more
hid
her
face
from
me
in
her
hands
and
even
yet
charmian
i
whispered
very
still
she
stood
with
her
face
bowed
upon
her
hands
but
she
could
not
hide
from
me
the
swift
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
speak
oh
charmian
speak
i
am
so
weak
so
weak
she
whispered
i
hate
myself
charmian
i
cried
oh
charmian
and
seized
her
hands
and
despite
her
resistance
drew
her
into
my
arms
and
clasping
her
close
forced
her
to
look
at
me
and
even
yet
what
more
what
more
tell
me
but
lying
back
across
my
arm
she
held
me
off
with
both
hands
do
she
cried
do
you
shame
me
let
me
go
god
knows
i
am
all
unworthy
charmian
and
so
low
in
my
abasement
that
to
touch
you
is
presumption
but
oh
woman
whom
i
have
loved
from
the
first
and
shall
to
the
end
have
you
stooped
in
your
infinite
mercy
to
lift
me
from
these
depths
is
it
a
new
life
you
offer
me
was
it
for
this
you
came
let
me
go
oh
peter
let
me
go
why
why
did
you
come
loose
me
why
did
you
come
to
meet
sir
maurice
vibart
to
meet
sir
maurice
i
repeated
dully
sir
maurice
and
in
that
moment
she
broke
from
me
and
stood
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
her
eyes
very
bright
as
though
defying
me
but
i
remained
where
i
was
my
arms
hanging
he
was
to
meet
me
here
at
nine
oh
charmian
i
whispered
are
all
women
so
cruel
as
you
i
wonder
and
turning
my
back
upon
her
i
leaned
above
the
mantel
staring
down
at
the
ashes
on
the
hearth
but
standings
there
i
heard
a
footstep
outside
and
swung
round
with
clenched
fists
yet
charmian
was
quicker
and
as
the
door
opened
and
sir
maurice
entered
she
was
between
us
he
stood
upon
the
threshold
dazzled
a
little
by
the
light
but
smiling
graceful
debonair
and
as
ever
indeed
his
very
presence
seemed
to
make
the
mean
room
the
meaner
by
contrast
and
as
he
bent
to
kiss
her
hand
i
became
acutely
conscious
of
my
own
rough
person
my
worn
and
shabby
clothes
and
of
my
hands
coarsened
and
grimed
by
labor
wherefore
my
frown
grew
the
blacker
and
i
clenched
my
fists
the
tighter
i
lost
my
way
charmian
he
began
but
though
late
i
am
none
the
less
welcome
i
trust
ah
you
frown
cousin
peter
quite
a
ghoulish
spot
this
at
night
you
probably
find
it
most
congenial
good
cousin
timon
of
athens
indeed
cousin
you
are
very
like
timon
of
athens
and
he
laughed
so
that
i
finding
my
pipe
upon
the
mantelshelf
began
to
turn
it
aimlessly
round
and
round
in
my
twitching
fingers
you
have
already
met
then
inquired
charmian
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
we
had
that
mutual
pleasure
nearly
a
week
ago
nodded
sir
maurice
when
we
agreed
to
disagree
as
we
always
have
done
and
shall
do
with
the
result
that
we
find
each
other
agreeably
disagreeable
i
had
hoped
that
you
might
be
friends
my
dear
charmian
i
wonder
at
you
he
sighed
so
unreasonable
would
you
have
us
contravene
the
established
order
of
things
it
was
preordained
that
cousin
peter
should
scowl
at
me
precisely
as
he
is
doing
and
that
i
should
shrug
my
shoulders
thus
at
cousin
peter
a
little
hate
with
say
a
dash
of
contempt
give
a
zest
to
that
dish
of
conglomerate
vapidity
which
we
call
life
and
make
it
almost
palatable
but
i
am
not
here
on
cousin
peter
account
he
went
on
drawing
a
step
nearer
to
her
at
this
moment
i
heartily
wish
him
among
his
hammers
and
chisels
i
have
come
for
you
charmian
because
i
love
you
i
have
sought
you
patiently
until
i
found
you
and
i
will
never
forego
you
so
long
as
life
lasts
but
you
know
all
this
yes
i
know
all
this
i
have
been
very
patient
charmian
submitting
to
your
whims
and
fancies
but
through
it
all
i
knew
and
in
your
woman
heart
you
knew
that
you
must
yield
at
last
that
the
chase
must
end
some
day
well
let
it
be
my
chaise
is
waiting
when
i
ran
away
from
you
in
the
storm
sir
maurice
i
told
you
once
and
for
all
that
i
hated
you
have
you
forgotten
hated
you
always
and
ever
and
tried
to
kill
you
oh
charmian
i
have
known
such
hate
transfigured
into
love
before
now
such
love
as
is
only
worth
the
winning
and
you
are
mine
you
always
were
from
the
first
moment
that
our
eyes
met
come
my
chaise
is
waiting
in
a
few
hours
we
can
be
in
london
or
dover
no
never
never
is
a
long
time
charmian
but
i
am
at
your
service
what
is
your
will
i
shall
remain
here
here
in
the
wilderness
with
my
husband
your
husband
i
am
going
to
marry
your
cousin
peter
vibart
the
pipe
slipped
from
my
fingers
and
shivered
to
pieces
on
the
floor
and
in
that
same
fraction
of
time
sir
maurice
had
turned
and
leapt
towards
me
but
as
he
came
i
struck
him
twice
with
left
and
right
and
he
staggered
backwards
to
the
wall
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
head
stooped
upon
his
hands
when
he
looked
up
his
face
was
dead
white
and
with
a
smear
of
blood
upon
it
that
seemed
to
accentuate
its
pallor
but
his
voice
came
smooth
and
unruffled
as
ever
the
mind
feminine
is
given
to
change
said
he
softly
and
i
shall
return
yes
i
shall
come
back
smile
madam
triumph
cousin
but
i
shall
come
between
you
yet
i
tell
you
i
come
between
you
living
or
dead
and
so
he
turned
and
was
gone
into
the
shadows
but
as
for
me
i
sat
down
and
leaning
my
chin
in
my
hand
stared
down
at
the
broken
fragments
of
my
pipe
peter
you
are
safe
now
said
i
without
looking
up
he
is
gone
but
oh
charmian
was
there
no
other
way
she
was
down
beside
me
on
her
knees
had
taken
my
hand
rough
and
grimy
as
it
was
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
and
so
had
drawn
it
about
her
neck
holding
it
there
and
with
her
face
hidden
in
my
breast
oh
strong
man
that
is
so
weak
she
whispered
oh
grave
philosopher
that
is
so
foolish
oh
lonely
boy
that
is
so
helpless
oh
peter
vibart
my
peter
charmian
said
i
trembling
what
does
it
mean
it
means
peter
yes
that
the
humble
person
yes
will
marry
you
whenever
you
will
if
yes
if
you
will
only
ask
her
chapter
xli
light
and
shadow
now
as
the
little
preacher
closed
his
book
the
sun
rose
up
filling
the
world
about
us
with
his
glory
and
looking
into
the
eyes
of
my
wife
it
seemed
that
a
veil
was
lifted
for
a
moment
there
and
i
read
that
which
her
lips
might
never
tell
and
there
also
were
joy
and
shame
and
a
deep
happiness
see
said
the
little
preacher
smiling
upon
us
it
is
day
and
a
very
glorious
one
already
a
thousand
little
choristers
of
god
great
cathedral
have
begun
to
chant
your
marriage
hymn
go
forth
together
man
and
wife
upon
this
great
wide
road
that
we
call
life
go
forth
together
made
strong
in
faith
and
brave
with
hope
and
the
memory
of
him
who
walked
these
ways
before
you
who
joyed
and
sorrowed
and
suffered
and
endured
all
things
even
as
we
must
go
forth
together
and
may
his
blessing
abide
with
you
and
the
that
passeth
understanding
and
so
we
turned
together
side
by
side
and
left
him
standing
amid
his
roses
silently
we
went
together
homewards
through
the
dewy
morning
with
a
soft
green
carpet
underfoot
and
leafy
arches
overhead
where
trees
bent
to
whisper
benedictions
and
shook
down
jewels
from
their
dewy
leaves
upon
us
as
we
passed
by
merry
brooks
that
laughed
and
chattered
and
gurgled
of
love
and
happiness
while
over
all
rose
the
swelling
chorus
of
the
birds
surely
never
had
they
piped
so
gladly
in
this
glad
world
before
not
even
for
the
gentle
spenser
though
he
says
there
was
none
of
them
that
feigned
to
sing
for
each
of
them
him
pained
to
find
out
merry
crafty
notes
they
ne
spared
not
their
throats
and
being
come
at
length
to
the
hollow
charmian
must
needs
pause
beside
the
pool
among
the
willows
to
view
herself
in
the
pellucid
water
and
in
this
mirror
our
eyes
met
and
lo
of
a
sudden
her
lashes
drooped
and
she
turned
her
head
aside
do
peter
she
whispered
do
look
at
me
so
how
may
i
help
it
when
you
are
so
beautiful
and
because
of
my
eyes
she
would
have
fled
from
me
but
i
caught
her
in
my
arms
and
there
amid
the
leaves
despite
the
jealous
babble
of
the
brook
for
the
second
time
in
my
life
her
lips
met
mine
and
gazing
yet
into
her
eyes
i
told
her
how
in
this
shady
bower
i
had
once
watched
her
weaving
leaves
into
her
hair
and
heard
her
talk
to
her
reflection
and
so
had
stolen
away
for
fear
of
her
beauty
fear
peter
we
were
so
far
out
of
the
world
and
i
longed
to
kiss
you
and
did
peter
and
did
charmian
because
we
were
so
very
far
from
the
world
and
because
you
were
so
very
much
alone
and
and
because
peter
because
you
are
a
gentle
man
and
strong
as
the
old
locket
says
and
do
you
remember
she
went
on
hurriedly
laying
her
cool
restraining
fingers
on
my
eager
lips
how
i
found
you
wearing
that
locket
and
how
you
blundered
and
stammered
over
it
and
pretended
to
read
your
homer
and
how
you
sang
to
prevent
me
and
how
gravely
you
reproved
me
and
how
you
called
me
a
and
how
you
deserved
it
sir
and
grew
more
helpless
and
ill
at
ease
than
ever
and
how
just
to
flatter
my
vanity
you
told
me
i
had
hair
and
so
you
have
said
i
kissing
a
curl
at
her
temple
when
you
unbind
it
my
charmian
it
will
cover
you
like
a
mantle
now
when
i
said
this
for
some
reason
she
glanced
up
at
me
sudden
and
shy
and
blushed
and
slipped
from
my
arms
and
fled
up
the
path
like
a
nymph
so
we
presently
entered
the
cottage
flushed
and
panting
and
laughing
for
sheer
happiness
and
now
she
rolled
up
her
sleeves
and
set
about
preparing
breakfast
laughing
my
assistance
to
scorn
but
growing
mightily
indignant
when
i
would
kiss
her
yet
blushing
and
yielding
nevertheless
and
while
she
bustled
to
and
fro
keeping
well
out
of
reach
of
my
arm
she
began
to
sing
in
her
soft
voice
to
herself
scarlet
town
where
i
was
born
there
was
a
fair
maid
dwellin
made
every
youth
cry
her
name
was
barbara
allen
oh
charmian
how
wonderful
you
are
in
the
merry
month
of
may
when
green
buds
they
were
swellin
surely
no
woman
ever
had
such
beautiful
arms
so
round
and
soft
and
white
charmian
she
turned
upon
me
with
a
fork
held
up
admonishingly
but
meeting
my
look
her
eyes
wavered
and
up
from
throat
to
brow
rushed
a
wave
of
burning
crimson
oh
peter
you
make
me
almost
afraid
of
you
she
whispered
and
hid
her
face
against
my
shoulder
are
you
content
to
have
married
such
a
very
poor
man
to
be
the
wife
of
a
village
blacksmith
why
peter
in
all
the
world
there
never
was
such
another
blacksmith
as
mine
and
and
there
the
kettle
is
boiling
over
let
it
said
i
and
the
bacon
the
bacon
will
burn
let
me
go
and
oh
peter
so
in
due
time
we
sat
down
to
our
solitary
wedding
breakfast
and
there
were
no
eyes
to
speculate
upon
the
bride
beauty
to
note
her
changing
color
or
the
glory
of
her
eyes
and
no
healths
were
proposed
or
toasts
drunk
nor
any
speeches
spoken
except
perhaps
by
my
good
friend
the
brook
outside
who
of
course
understood
the
situation
and
babbled
tolerantly
of
us
to
the
listening
trees
like
the
grim
old
philosopher
he
was
in
this
solitude
we
were
surely
closer
together
and
belonged
more
fully
to
each
other
for
all
her
looks
and
thoughts
were
mine
as
mine
were
hers
and
as
we
ate
sometimes
talking
and
sometimes
laughing
though
rarely
one
seldom
laughs
in
the
wilderness
our
hands
would
stray
to
meet
each
other
across
the
table
and
eye
would
answer
eye
while
in
the
silence
the
brook
would
lift
its
voice
to
chuckle
throaty
chuckles
and
outlandish
witticisms
such
as
could
only
be
expected
from
an
old
reprobate
who
had
grown
so
in
years
and
had
seen
so
very
much
of
life
at
such
times
charmian
cheeks
would
flush
and
her
lashes
droop
as
though
indeed
she
were
versed
in
the
language
of
brooks
so
the
golden
hours
slipped
by
the
sun
crept
westward
and
evening
stole
upon
us
this
is
a
very
rough
place
for
you
said
i
and
sighed
we
were
sitting
on
the
bench
before
the
door
and
charmian
had
laid
her
folded
hands
upon
my
shoulder
and
her
chin
upon
her
hands
and
now
she
echoed
my
sigh
but
answered
without
stirring
it
is
the
dearest
place
in
all
the
world
and
very
lonely
i
pursued
i
shall
be
busy
all
day
long
peter
and
you
always
reach
home
as
evening
falls
and
then
then
oh
i
be
lonely
but
i
am
such
a
gloomy
fellow
at
the
best
of
times
and
very
clumsy
charmian
and
something
of
a
failure
and
my
husband
peter
peter
oh
peter
i
started
and
rose
to
my
feet
peter
oh
peter
called
the
voice
again
seemingly
from
the
road
and
now
i
thought
it
sounded
familiar
charmian
stole
her
arms
aboat
my
neck
i
think
it
is
simon
said
i
uneasily
what
can
have
brought
him
and
he
will
never
venture
down
into
the
hollow
on
account
of
the
ghost
i
must
go
and
see
what
he
wants
yes
peter
she
murmured
but
the
clasp
of
her
arms
tightened
what
is
it
said
i
looking
into
her
troubled
eyes
charmian
you
are
trembling
what
is
it
i
do
know
but
oh
peter
i
feel
as
if
a
shadow
a
black
and
awful
shadow
were
creeping
upon
us
hiding
us
from
each
other
i
am
very
foolish
are
i
and
this
our
peter
come
with
me
charmian

us
go
together
no
i
must
wait

is
woman

to
wait
but
i
am
brave
again

see
what
is
wanted
i
found
simon
sure
enough
in
the
lane
seated
in
his
cart
and
his
face
looked
squarer
and
grimmer
even
than
usual
oh
peter
said
he
gripping
my
hand
it

old

simon
i
answered
wait
here
for
me
charmian
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
cottage
and
as
she
looked
up
at
me
i
saw
the
trouble
was
back
in
her
eyes
again
you
must
go
leave
me
she
inquired
for
a
little
while
yes
i
i
felt
it
she
said
with
a
pitiful
little
smile
the
ancient
is
dying
said
i
now
as
i
spoke
my
eyes
encountered
the
staple
above
the
door
wherefore
mounting
upon
a
chair
i
seized
and
shook
it
and
lo
the
rusty
iron
snapped
off
in
my
fingers
like
glass
and
i
slipped
it
into
my
pocket
oh
peter
do
go
do
leave
me
cried
charmian
suddenly
and
i
saw
that
her
face
was
very
pale
and
that
she
trembled
charmian
said
i
and
sprang
to
her
side
oh
my
love
what
is
it
it
is
as
though
the
shadow
hung
over
us
darker
and
more
threatening
peter
as
if
our
happiness
were
at
an
end
i
seem
to
hear
threat
to
come
between
us
living
or
dead
i
am
afraid
she
whispered
clinging
to
me
i
am
afraid
but
all
at
once
she
was
calm
again
and
full
of
calling
herself
weak
and
foolish
and
hysterical
though
indeed
i
was
never
hysterical
before
and
telling
me
that
i
must
go
that
it
was
my
duty
to
go
to
the
gentle
dying
old
man
urging
me
to
the
door
almost
eagerly
till
being
out
of
the
cottage
she
must
needs
fall
once
more
and
wind
her
arms
about
my
neck
with
a
great
sob
but
oh
you
will
come
back
soon
very
soon
peter
and
we
know
that
nothing
can
ever
come
between
us
again
never
again
my
husband
and
with
that
blessed
word
she
drew
me
down
to
her
lips
and
turning
fled
into
the
cottage
i
went
on
slowly
up
the
path
to
meet
simon
and
as
i
went
my
heart
was
heavy
and
my
mind
full
of
a
strange
foreboding
but
i
never
thought
of
the
omen
of
the
knife
that
had
once
fallen
and
quivered
in
the
floor
between
us
as
done
it
said
simon
staring
very
hard
at
his
horse
ears
as
we
jogged
along
the
road

upstairs

slipped

says
he

poor
old
feyther
o
yourn
never
go
up
these
stairs
no
more
says
no
more
after
this
simon
fell
silent
and
i
likewise
until
we
reached
the
village
before
the
bull
was
a
group
who
talked
with
hushed
voices
and
grave
faces
even
old
amos
grinned
no
more
the
old
man
lay
in
his
great
bed
propped
up
with
pillows
and
with
prue
beside
him
to
smooth
his
silver
hair
with
tender
fingers
and
black
george
towering
in
the
shade
of
the
like
a
grieving
giant

rusty
bit

he
lay
very
quiet
for
a
while
with
the
broken
staple
clasped
to
his
breast
and
his
eyes
closed
peter
said
he
suddenly

all
nearer

across

dark

but
i

owd
stapil
an
there

a
light
beyond
the
river
so
the
ancient
sighed
and
crossed
the
dark
river
into
the
land
of
light
eternal
chapter
xlii
how
sir
maurice
kept
his
word
night
with
a
rising
moon
and
over
all
things
a
great
quietude
a
deep
deep
silence
air
close
and
heavy
without
a
breath
to
wake
the
slumbering
trees
an
oppressive
stillness
in
which
small
sounds
magnified
themselves
and
seemed
disproportionately
loud
and
presently
as
i
went
upon
my
way
i
forgot
the
old
man
sleeping
so
peacefully
with
the
rusty
staple
clasped
to
his
shrunken
breast
and
thought
only
of
the
proud
woman
who
had
given
her
life
into
my
keeping
and
who
henceforth
would
walk
with
me
hand
in
hand
upon
this
broad
highway
over
rough
places
and
smooth
even
unto
the
end
so
i
strode
on
full
of
a
deep
and
abiding
joy
and
with
heart
that
throbbed
and
hands
that
trembled
because
i
knew
that
she
watched
and
waited
for
my
coming
a
sound
broke
upon
the
stillness
sudden
and
sharp
like
the
snapping
of
a
stick
i
stopped
and
glanced
about
me
but
it
had
come
and
gone
lost
in
the
calm
and
presently
reaching
the
leafy
path
that
led
steeply
down
into
the
hollow
i
paused
a
moment
to
look
about
me
and
to
listen
again
but
the
deep
silence
was
all
unbroken
save
for
the
slumberous
song
of
the
brook
that
stole
up
to
me
from
the
shadows
and
i
wondered
idly
what
that
sudden
sound
might
have
been
so
i
began
to
descend
this
leafy
path
and
went
on
to
meet
that
which
lay
waiting
for
me
in
the
shadows
it
was
dark
here
among
the
trees
for
the
moon
was
low
as
yet
but
every
now
and
then
she
sent
a
kindly
ray
through
some
opening
amid
the
leaves
so
that
as
i
descended
the
path
i
seemed
to
be
wading
through
small
limpid
pools
of
radiance
but
all
at
once
i
stopped
staring
at
something
which
lay
at
the
edge
of
one
of
these
pools
a
white
claw
a
hand
whose
fingers
had
sunk
deep
and
embedded
themselves
in
the
turf
and
beyond
this
gleaming
hand
was
an
arm
and
beyond
that
again
something
that
bulked
across
my
path
darker
than
the
shadows
running
forward
i
stood
looking
down
at
that
which
lay
at
my
feet
so
very
still
and
stooped
suddenly
and
turned
it
over
that
i
might
see
the
face
and
seeing
it
started
back
in
shuddering
horror
for
in
those
features
hideous
with
blood
stained
and
blackened
with
powder
i
recognized
my
cousin
sir
maurice
vibart
then
remembering
the
stick
that
had
snapped
i
wondered
no
more
but
a
sudden
deadly
faintness
came
upon
me
so
that
i
leaned
weakly
against
a
tree
near
by
a
rustling
of
leaves
a
shuddering
breath
and
though
i
did
not
raise
my
head
i
knew
that
charmian
was
there
oh
peter
she
whispered
oh
peter
and
that
was
all
but
moved
by
something
in
her
tone
i
glanced
up
her
eyes
were
wide
and
staring
not
at
me
but
at
that
which
lay
between
us
her
face
was
pallid
even
her
lips
had
lost
their
color
and
she
clasped
one
hand
upon
her
bosom
the
other
was
hidden
in
the
folds
of
her
gown
hidden
as
i
remembered
to
have
seen
it
once
before
but
now
it
struck
me
with
a
horrible
significance
wherefore
i
reached
out
and
caught
that
hidden
hand
and
drew
the
weapon
from
her
nerveless
fingers
holding
it
where
the
light
could
play
upon
it
she
started
shivered
violently
and
covered
her
eyes
while
i
looking
down
at
the
pistol
in
my
hand
saw
that
it
had
lately
been
discharged
he
has
kept
his
word
she
whispered
he
has
kept
his
word
yes
charmian
he
has
kept
his
word
oh
peter
she
moaned
and
stretched
out
her
hands
towards
me
yet
she
kept
her
face
turned
from
that
which
lay
across
the
path
between
us
and
her
hands
were
shaking
pitifully
peter
she
cried
with
a
sudden
break
in
her
voice
but
i
went
on
wiping
the
soot
from
the
with
the
end
of
my
neckerchief
then
all
at
once
she
was
beside
me
clasping
my
arm
and
she
was
pleading
with
me
her
words
coming
in
a
flood
no
peter
no
oh
god
you
do
not
think
it
you
ca
you
must
i
was
alone
waiting
for
you
and
the
hours
passed
and
you
come
and
i
was
nervous
and
frightened
and
full
of
awful
fancies
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
creeping
round
the
cottage
once
i
thought
some
one
peered
in
at
the
lattice
and
once
i
thought
some
one
tried
the
door
and
so
because
i
was
frightened
peter
i
took
that
that
and
held
it
in
my
hand
peter
and
while
i
sat
there
it
seemed
more
than
ever
that
somebody
was
breathing
softly
outside
the
door
and
so
peter
i
could
bear
it
any
more
and
opened
the
lattice
and
fired
in
the
air
i
swear
it
was
in
the
air
and
i
stood
there
at
the
open
casement
sick
with
fear
and
trying
to
pray
for
you
because
i
knew
he
had
come
back
to
kill
you
peter
and
while
i
prayed
i
heard
another
shot
not
close
but
faint
like
the
snapping
of
a
twig
peter
and
i
ran
out
and
oh
peter
that
is
all
but
you
believe
oh
you
believe
do
you
peter
while
she
spoke
i
had
slipped
the
pistol
into
my
pocket
and
now
i
held
out
my
hands
to
her
and
drew
her
near
and
gazed
into
the
troubled
depths
of
her
eyes
charmian
said
i
charmian
i
love
you
and
god
forbid
that
i
should
ever
doubt
you
any
more
so
with
a
sigh
she
sank
in
my
embrace
her
arms
crept
about
my
neck
and
our
lips
met
and
clung
together
but
even
then
while
i
looked
upon
her
beauty
while
the
contact
of
her
lips
thrilled
through
me
even
then
in
my
mind
i
saw
the
murderous
pistol
in
her
hand
as
i
had
seen
it
months
ago
indeed
it
almost
seemed
that
she
divined
my
thought
for
she
drew
swiftly
back
and
looked
up
at
me
with
haggard
eyes
peter
she
whispered
what
is
it
what
is
it
oh
charmian
said
i
over
and
over
again
i
love
you
i
love
you
and
i
kissed
her
appealing
eyes
and
stayed
her
questioning
lips
with
my
kisses
i
love
you
more
than
my
life
more
than
honor
more
than
my
soul
and
because
i
so
love
you
you
must
leave
me
leave
you
ah
no
peter

no
i
am
your
wife

must
stay
with
you
to
suffer
and
share
your
troubles
and
dangers

is
my
right
my
privilege
let
us
go
away
together
now

anywhere
only

us
be
together
my
husband

i
cried
do
do
you
think
it
is
so
easy
to
remain
here
without
you
to
lose
you
so
soon
so
very
soon
if
i
only
loved
you
a
little
less
ah

you
see
before
the
week
is
out
my
description
will
be
all
over
england

should
be
caught
and
you
would
have
to
stand
beside
me
in
a
court
of
justice
and
face
the
shame
of
it
dear
love
it
would
be
my
pride
my
pride
peter
to
face
them
all
to
clasp
this
dear
hand
in
mine
never
i
cried
clenching
my
fists
never
you
must
leave
me
no
one
must
know
charmian
brown
ever
existed
you
must
go
hush
she
whispered
clasping
me
tighter
listen
some
one
is
coming
away
to
the
right
we
could
hear
the
leaves
rustling
as
though
a
strong
wind
passed
through
them
a
light
flickered
went
out
flickered
again
and
a
voice
hailed
faintly
hallo
come
said
charmian
clasping
my
hand
let
us
go
and
meet
him
no
charmian
no
i
must
see
this
man
alone
you
must
leave
here
you
can
catch
the
london
mail
at
the
cross
roads
go
to
blackheath
to
sir
richard
anstruther
he
is
my
friend
tell
him
everything
she
was
down
at
my
feet
and
had
caught
my
hand
to
her
bosom
i
ca
she
cried
i
ca
go
and
leave
you
here
alone
i
have
loved
you
so
from
the
very
first
and
it
seems
that
each
day
my
love
has
grown
until
it
is
part
of
me
oh
peter
do
send
me
away
from
you
it
will
kill
me
i
think
better
that
than
the
shame
of
a
prison
i
exclaimed
and
while
i
spoke
i
lifted
her
in
my
arms
oh
i
am
proud
proud
to
have
won
such
a
love
as
yours
let
me
try
to
be
worthy
of
it
my
beloved
and
so
i
kissed
her
and
would
have
turned
away
but
her
arms
clung
about
me
oh
peter
she
sobbed
if
you
must
go
if
you
will
go
call
me
your
wife
just
once
peter
the
hovering
light
was
much
nearer
now
and
the
rustle
of
leaves
louder
as
i
stooped
above
her
cold
hands
and
kissed
their
trembling
fingers
some
day
said
i
some
day
if
there
is
a
just
god
in
heaven
we
shall
meet
again
perhaps
soon
perhaps
late
until
then
let
us
dream
of
that
glorious
golden
some
day
but
now
farewell
oh
beloved
wife
with
a
broken
cry
she
drew
my
head
down
upon
her
breast
and
clasped
it
there
while
her
tears
mingled
with
her
kisses
and
so
crying
my
name
she
turned
and
was
lost
among
the
leaves
chapter
xliii
how
i
set
out
to
face
my
destiny
the
pallid
moon
shone
down
pitilessly
upon
the
dead
white
face
that
stared
up
at
me
through
its
grime
and
blood
with
the
same
contempt
of
me
that
it
had
worn
in
life
the
drawn
lips
seemed
to
mock
me
and
the
clenched
fists
to
defy
me
still
so
that
i
shivered
and
turned
to
watch
the
oncoming
light
that
danced
like
a
among
the
shadows
presently
it
stopped
and
a
voice
hailed
once
more
hallo
hallo
i
called
back
this
way
this
way
in
a
little
while
i
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
whom
i
at
once
recognized
as
the
postilion
bearing
the
lanthorn
of
a
chaise
and
as
he
approached
it
struck
me
that
this
meeting
was
very
much
like
our
first
save
for
him
who
lay
in
the
shadows
staring
up
at
me
with
unwinking
eyes
so
ho
exclaimed
the
postilion
as
he
came
up
raising
his
lanthorn
that
he
might
view
me
the
better
it
you
again
is
it
yes
i
nodded
well
i
do
like
it
he
grumbled
of
each
other
again
like
this
in
this
ghashly
place
no
i
do
like
it
too
much
like
last
time
to
be
and
as
you
know
i
ca
abide
if
i
was
to
ax
you
where
my
master
was
like
as
not
you
tell
me
was
here
said
i
and
moving
aside
pointed
to
the
shadow
the
postilion
stepped
nearer
lowering
his
lanthorns
then
staggered
blindly
backward
lord
he
whimpered
lord
love
me
and
stood
staring
with
dropped
jaw
where
is
your
chaise
up
yonder
yonder
in
the
lane
he
mumbled
his
eyes
still
fixed
then
help
me
to
carry
him
there
no
no
i
durs
touch
it
i
ca
not
me
not
me
i
think
you
will
said
i
and
took
the
pistol
from
my
pocket
ai
one
enough
for
he
muttered
put
it
away
come
i
do
it
put
it
away
so
i
dropped
the
weapon
back
into
my
pocket
while
the
postilion
shivering
violently
stooped
with
me
above
the
inanimate
figure
and
with
our
limp
burden
between
us
we
staggered
and
stumbled
up
the
path
and
along
the
lane
to
where
stood
a
light
traveling
chaise
ai
likely
to
come
to
this
time
i
thinkin
said
the
postilion
mopping
the
sweat
from
his
brow
and
grinning
with
pallid
lips
after
we
had
got
our
burden
into
the
vehicle
no
likely
to
wake
up
no
more
nor
yet
my
off
this
side
jordan
no
i
answered
beginning
to
unwind
my
neckcloth
nor
it
ai
no
good
to
go
and
of
up
like
you
did
last
time
no
said
i
no
and
stepping
into
the
chaise
i
muffled
that
disfigured
face
in
my
neckcloth
having
done
which
i
closed
the
door
what
now
inquired
the
postilion
now
you
can
drive
us
to
cranbrook
what
be
you
too
yes
i
nodded
yes
i
am
coming
too
lord
love
me
he
exclaimed
and
a
moment
later
i
heard
him
chirruping
to
his
horses
the
whip
cracked
and
the
chaise
lurched
forward
whether
he
had
some
wild
notion
that
i
might
attempt
to
descend
and
make
my
escape
before
we
reached
our
destination
i
can
not
say
but
he
drove
at
a
furious
pace
taking
corners
at
reckless
speed
so
that
the
chaise
lurched
and
swayed
most
violently
and
more
than
once
i
was
compelled
to
hold
that
awful
figure
down
upon
the
seat
before
me
lest
it
should
slide
to
the
floor
on
we
sped
past
hedge
and
tree
by
field
and
lonely
wood
and
ever
in
my
ears
was
the
whir
of
the
wheels
the
drumming
of
hoofs
and
the
crack
of
the
whip
and
ever
the
flitting
moonbeams
danced
across
that
muffled
face
until
it
seemed
that
the
features
writhed
and
gibed
at
me
beneath
the
folds
of
the
neckerchief
and
so
at
last
came
lights
and
houses
and
the
sound
of
excited
voices
as
we
pulled
up
before
the
posting
house
at
cranbrook
looking
from
the
window
i
saw
a
ring
of
faces
with
eyes
that
gleamed
in
the
light
of
the
lanthorns
and
every
eye
was
fixed
on
me
and
every
foot
gave
back
a
step
as
i
descended
from
the
chaise
and
while
i
stood
there
the
postilion
came
with
two
ostlers
who
between
them
bore
a
heavy
burden
through
the
crowd
stumbling
awkwardly
as
they
went
and
as
men
saw
that
which
they
carried
there
came
a
low
deep
sound
wordless
inarticulate
yet
full
of
menace
but
above
this
murmur
rose
a
voice
and
i
saw
the
postilion
push
his
way
to
the
steps
of
the
inn
and
turn
there
with
hands
clenched
and
raised
above
his
head
my
master
sir
maurice
vibart
is
killed
shot
to
death
murdered
down
there
in
the
he
cried
and
if
you
axes
me
who
done
it
i
says
to
you
did
so
me
god
and
speaking
he
raised
his
whip
and
pointed
at
me
once
more
there
rose
that
inarticulate
sound
of
menace
and
once
more
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
were
a
fine
said
a
voice
ah
so
gay
an
said
another
ay
ay
a
generous
open
said
a
third
and
every
moment
the
murmur
swelled
and
grew
more
threatening
fists
were
clenched
and
sticks
flourished
so
that
instinctively
i
set
my
back
against
the
chaise
for
it
seemed
they
lacked
only
some
one
to
take
the
initiative
ere
they
fell
upon
me
the
postilion
saw
this
too
for
with
a
shout
he
sprang
forward
his
whip
upraised
but
as
he
did
so
the
crowd
was
burst
asunder
he
was
caught
by
a
mighty
arm
and
black
george
stood
beside
me
his
eyes
glowing
his
fists
clenched
and
his
hair
and
beard
bristling
stand
back
you
chaps
he
growled
stand
back
or
i
some
on
ye
be
ye
all
a
lot
o
dogs
to
set
on
an
worry
one
as
is
all
alone
and
then
turning
to
me
what
be
the
matter
wi
the
fools
peter
matter
cried
the
postilion
murder
be
the
matter
my
master
be
murdered
shot
to
death
an
there
stands
the
man
as
done
it
murder
cried
george
in
an
altered
voice
murder
now
as
he
spoke
the
crowd
parted
and
four
ostlers
appeared
bearing
a
hurdle
between
them
and
on
the
hurdle
lay
a
figure
an
elegant
figure
whose
head
and
face
were
still
muffled
in
my
neckerchief
i
saw
george
start
and
like
a
flash
his
glance
came
round
to
my
bare
throat
and
dismay
was
in
his
eyes
peter
he
murmured
then
he
laughed
suddenly
and
clapped
his
hand
down
upon
my
shoulder
look
you
chaps
he
cried
facing
the
crowd
this
is
my
friend
peter
an
honest
man
an
no
murderer
as
will
tell
ye
this
is
my
friend

honest
man

no
murderer
but
i
shook
my
head
oh

he
whispered

george
i
answered
it

be
of
no
avail
besides
i
can
say
nothing
to
clear
myself

peter
nothing
george
this
man
was
shot
and
killed
in
the
hollow
i
found
him
lying
dead
i
found
the
empty
pistol
and
the
postilion
yonder
found
me
standing
over
the
body
that
is
all
i
have
to
tell
peter
said
he
speaking
hurriedly
beneath
his
breath
oh
peter
let
run
for
it
be
main
easy
for
the
likes
you
an
me
no
george
i
answered
it

than
useless
but
one
thing
i
do
ask
of
you

who

me
so
much
better
than
most
and
it
is
that
you
will
bid
me
and
take
my
hand
once
more
george
here
before
all
these
eyes
that
look
upon
me
as
a
murderer
and
before
i
had
finished
he
had
my
hand
in
both
of
his
nay
had
thrown
one
great
arm
protectingly
about
me
why
peter
he
began
in
a
strangely
cracked
voice
oh
man
as
i
love

as
i
believe
their
lies
an
peter
such
fighters
as
you

me

a
bolt
for
it
ecod
i
want
to
hit
somebody
never
doubt
me
peter
your
friend
an
they
go
over
like
skittles
like
skittles
peter
the
crowd
which
had
swelled
momentarily
surged
opened
and
a
man
on
horseback
pushed
his
way
towards
me
a
man
in
some
disorder
of
dress
as
though
he
had
clothed
himself
in
a
hurry
rough
hands
were
now
laid
upon
me
i
saw
george
fist
raised
threateningly
but
caught
it
in
my
grasp
said
i
george
and
do
look
so
downcast
man
but
we
were
forced
apart
and
i
was
pushed
and
pulled
and
hustled
away
through
a
crowd
of
faces
whose
eyes
damned
me
wherever
i
looked
along
panelled
passage
ways
and
into
a
long
dim
room
where
sat
the
gentleman
i
had
seen
on
the
horse
busily
tying
his
cravat
to
whom
i
delivered
up
the
pistol
and
answered
divers
questions
as
well
as
i
might
and
by
whom
after
much
jotting
of
notes
and
memoranda
i
was
delivered
over
to
four
burly
fellows
who
with
deep
gravity
and
a
grip
much
tighter
than
was
necessary
once
more
led
me
out
into
the
moonlit
street
where
were
people
who
pressed
forward
to
stare
into
my
face
and
people
who
leaned
out
of
windows
to
stare
down
upon
my
head
and
many
more
who
followed
at
my
heels
and
thus
in
much
estate
i
ascended
a
flight
of
worn
stone
steps
into
the
churchyard
and
so
by
a
way
of
tombs
and
graves
came
at
last
to
the
great
square
into
which
i
was
incontinently
thrust
and
there
very
securely
locked
up
chapter
xliv
the
bow
street
runners
it
was
toward
evening
of
the
next
day
that
the
door
of
my
prison
was
opened
and
two
men
entered
the
first
was
a
tall
individual
of
a
melancholy
cast
of
feature
who
despite
the
season
was
wrapped
in
a
long
frieze
coat
reaching
almost
to
his
heels
from
the
pocket
of
which
projected
a
short
staff
or
truncheon
he
came
forward
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
bony
chin
on
his
breast
looking
at
me
under
the
brim
of
a
somewhat
hat
that
is
to
say
he
looked
at
my
feet
and
my
hands
and
my
throat
and
my
chin
but
never
seemed
to
get
any
higher
his
companion
on
the
contrary
bustled
forward
and
tapping
me
familiarly
on
the
shoulder
looked
me
over
with
a
bright
appraising
eye
me
jeremy
said
he
addressing
his
saturnine
friend
me
if
i
ever
see
a
pore
cove

my
mind
fancy

tall
an
twelve

bit
pale
round

young
cove
but
lord
that
only
too
here
he
produced
from
the
depths
of
a
capacious
pocket
something
that
glittered
beneath
his
agile
fingers
and
might
be
your
general
young
cove
he
went
on
affably
bobbish

bobbish

he
spoke
with
a
sudden
dexterous
motion
he
had
snapped
something
upon
my
wrists
so
quickly
that
at
the
contact
of
the
cold
steel
i
started
and
as
i
did
so
something
jingled
faintly
there
he
exclaimed
clapping
me
on
the
shoulder
again
but
at
the
same
time
casting
a
sharp
glance
at
my
shackled
wrists

growled
jeremy
leading
the
way
out
in
the
street
stood
a
chaise
and
four
surrounded
by
a
pushing
jostling
throng
of
men
women
and
children
who
catching
sight
of
me
between
the
bow
street
runners
forgot
to
push
and
jostle
and
stared
at
me
with
every
eye
and
tooth
they
possessed
until
i
was
hidden
in
the
chaise
right
away
growled
jeremy
shutting
the
door
with
a
bang
whoa
roared
a
voice
and
a
great
shaggy
golden
head
was
thrust
in
at
the
window
and
a
hand
reached
down
and
grasped
mine
a
pipe
an
peter
from

a
flask
o

from

even
as

the
postboy
whip
cracked
and
the
horses
plunged
forward
george
i
cried
dear
fellow
and
the
last
i
saw
of

was
as
he
stood
rubbing

away
with

fist
and
shaking
the
other

which
concerns
itself
among
other
matters
with
the
boots
of
the
saturnine
jeremy
a
bottle
o
rum
said
the
man
bob
and
taking
it
up
very
abstracted
of
eye
he
removed
the
cork
sniffed
at
it
tasted
it
took
a
gulp
and
handed
it
over
to
his
companion
who
also
looked
at
sniffed
at
and
tasted
it
and
what
d
make
o
that
jeremy
tasted
better
afore
now
growled
jeremy
and
immediately
took
another
pull
too
pursued
the
man
bob
in
a
ruminating
tone
an
i
always
was
partial
to
chicken
and
forthwith
opening
the
dainty
parcel
he
helped
himself
and
his
companion
also
what
d
make
o
them
jeremy
he
inquired
munching
i
eat
wuss
rumbled
jeremy
also
munching
young
cove
they
does
you
credit
said
the
man
bob
nodding
to
me
with
great
urbanity
great
credit
there
ai
many
as
can
such
as
them
though
to
be
sure
they
eats
uncommon
quick
there
jeremy
but
indeed
the
sandwiches
were
already
only
a
memory
wherefore
his
brow
grew
black
and
he
glared
at
the
still
munching
jeremy
who
met
his
looks
with
his
usual
impenetrable
gloom
a
pipe
and
mused
the
man
bob
after
we
had
ridden
some
while
in
silence
and
with
the
same
serene
unconsciousness
of
manner
he
took
the
pipe
filled
it
lighted
it
and
puffed
with
an
air
of
dreamy
content
jeremy
is
a
sort
he
began
with
a
complacent
flourish
of
the
pipe
a
sort
but
lord
young
cove
is
ekalled
only
by
and
why
do
smoke
go
easy
wi
the
rum
jeremy
nothin
like
a
pipe
o
to
soothe
such
things
away
i
got
my
eye
on
ye
jeremy
no
there
nothin
like
a
pipe
o
look
at
me
i
were
the
infant
that
ever
was
till
i
took
to
smokin
and
whatever
i
am
i
ai
nor
yet
and
many
a
cove
as
is
now
no
more
wept
over
me
at
partin
they
generally
always
do

jeremy
uncorking
the
with
his
teeth
no
jerry
no
returned
the
other
blowing
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
ai
all
the
same
arter
you
wi
that
bottle
you
cryers
and
laughers
and
and
silent
ones
and
the
silent
coves
is
the
dangerousest
arter
you
wi
the
bottle
jeremy
now
you
my
covey
he
went
on
tapping
my
hand
gently
with
his
you
ai
exactly
talkative
in
fact
not
wishin
no
offense
i
might
say
as
you
was
inclined
to
be
one
o
the
silent
ones
not
as
i
that
again
you
far
from
it
only
you
reminds
me
of
a
young
cove
as
the
to
get
took
for
forgery
and
who
arter
me
and
to
in
my
pleasant
way
went
and
managed
to
commit
sooicide
under
my
very
nose
which
were
nice
or
even
respectable
considerin
arter
you
wi
the
bottle
jeremy
jeremy
growled
held
up
the
bottle
to
the
failing
light
of
evening
measured
its
contents
with
his
thumb
and
extended
it
unwillingly
towards
his
comrade
ready
hand
but
it
never
got
there
for
at
that
instant
the
chaise
lurched
violently
there
was
a
cry
a
splintering
of
glass
a
crash
and
i
was
lying
half
stunned
in
a
ditch
listening
to
the
chorus
of
oaths
and
cries
that
rose
from
the
cloud
of
dust
where
the
frightened
horses
reared
and
plunged
how
long
i
remained
thus
i
can
not
say
but
all
at
once
i
found
myself
upon
my
feet
running
down
the
road
for
hazy
though
my
mind
yet
was
i
could
think
only
of
escape
of
liberty
and
freedom
at
any
price
at
any
cost
so
i
ran
on
down
the
road
somewhat
unsteadily
as
yet
because
my
fall
had
been
a
heavy
one
and
my
brain
still
reeled
i
heard
a
shout
behind
me
the
sharp
crack
of
a
pistol
and
a
bullet
sang
over
my
head
and
then
i
knew
they
were
after
me
for
i
could
hear
the
patter
of
their
feet
upon
the
hard
road
now
as
i
ran
my
brain
cleared
but
this
only
served
me
to
appreciate
the
difficulty
of
eluding
men
so
seasoned
and
hardy
as
my
pursuers
moreover
the
handcuffs
galled
my
wrists
and
the
short
connecting
chain
hampered
my
movements
considerably
and
i
saw
that
upon
this
straight
level
i
must
soon
be
run
down
or
shot
from
behind
glancing
back
i
beheld
them
some
hundred
yards
or
so
away
elbows
in
heads
up
running
with
that
long
free
stride
that
speaks
of
endurance
i
increased
the
pace
the
ground
flew
beneath
me
but
when
i
glanced
again
though
the
man
bob
had
dropped
back
the
saturnine
jeremy
ran
on
no
nearer
but
no
farther
than
before
now
as
i
went
i
presently
espied
that
for
which
i
had
looked
a
gate
set
in
the
midst
of
the
hedge
but
it
was
closed
and
never
did
a
gate
before
or
since
appear
quite
so
high
and
insurmountable
but
with
the
desperation
of
despair
i
turned
ran
at
it
and
sprang
swinging
my
arms
above
my
head
as
i
did
so
my
foot
grazed
the
top
bar
down
i
came
slipped
stumbled
regained
my
balance
and
ran
on
over
the
springy
turf
i
heard
a
crash
behind
me
an
oath
a
second
pistol
barked
and
immediately
it
seemed
that
a
hot
iron
seared
my
forearm
and
glancing
down
i
saw
the
skin
cut
and
bleeding
but
finding
it
no
worse
breathed
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
and
ran
on
by
that
leap
i
had
probably
gained
some
twenty
yards
i
would
nurse
my
strength
therefore
if
i
could
once
gain
the
woods
how
far
off
were
they
a
mile
well
i
could
run
that
easily
thanks
to
my
hardy
life
stay
what
was
that
sound
behind
me
the
fall
of
flying
feet
or
the
throbbing
of
my
own
heart
i
turned
my
head
the
man
jeremy
was
within
twelve
yards
of
me
lean
and
spare
his
head
thrust
forward
he
ran
with
the
long
easy
stride
of
a
greyhound
so
it
was
to
be
a
question
of
endurance
well
i
had
caught
my
second
wind
by
now
i
set
my
teeth
and
clenching
my
fists
lengthened
my
stride
and
now
indeed
the
real
struggle
began
my
pursuer
had
long
ago
abandoned
his
coat
but
his
boots
were
heavier
and
clumsier
than
those
i
wore
but
then
again
my
confining
shackles
seemed
to
contract
my
chest
and
the
handcuffs
galled
my
wrists
cruelly
on
i
went
scattering
flocks
of
scampering
sheep
past
meditative
cows
who
started
up
puffing
out
snorts
of
perfume
scrambling
through
hedges
over
gate
and
stile
and
ditch
with
eyes
upon
the
distant
woods
full
of
the
purple
gloom
of
evening
and
in
my
ears
the
muffled
thud
thud
thud
thud
of
the
pursuit
sometimes
seeming
much
nearer
and
sometimes
much
farther
off
but
always
the
same
rhythmic
remorseless
thud
thud
thud
thud
on
and
ever
on
climbing
steep
uplands
plunging
down
precipitous
slopes
past
brawling
brooks
and
silent
pools
all
red
and
gold
with
sunset
past
oak
and
ash
and
thorn
on
and
on
with
ever
those
thudding
footfalls
close
behind
and
as
we
ran
it
seemed
to
me
that
our
feet
beat
out
a
kind
of
cadence
his
heavy
shoes
and
my
lighter
ones
thud
thud
pad
pad
thud
thud
pad
pad
until
they
would
suddenly
become
confused
and
mingle
with
each
other
one
moment
it
seemed
that
i
almost
loved
the
fellow
and
the
next
that
i
bitterly
hated
him
whether
i
had
gained
or
not
i
could
not
tell
to
look
back
was
to
lose
ground
the
woods
were
close
now
so
close
that
i
fancied
i
heard
the
voice
of
their
myriad
leaves
calling
to
me
encouraging
me
but
my
breath
was
panting
thick
and
short
my
stride
was
less
sure
my
wrists
were
raw
and
bleeding
and
the
ceaseless
jingle
of
my
chain
maddened
me
thud
thud
untiring
persistent
thud
thud
the
pulse
at
my
temples
throbbed
in
time
with
it
my
breath
panted
to
it
and
surely
it
was
nearer
more
distinct
yes
he
had
gained
on
me
in
the
last
but
how
much
i
cast
a
look
over
my
shoulder
it
was
but
a
glance
yet
i
saw
that
he
had
lessened
the
distance
between
us
by
half
his
face
shone
with
sweat
his
mouth
was
a
line
his
nostrils
broad
and
expanded
his
eyes
staring
and
shot
with
blood
but
he
ran
on
with
the
same
long
easy
stride
that
was
slowly
but
surely
wearing
me
down
we
were
descending
a
long
grassy
slope
and
i
stumbled
more
than
once
and
rolled
in
my
course
but
on
came
those
remorseless
footfalls
thud
thud
thud
thud
strong
and
sure
as
ever
he
was
nearing
me
fast
he
was
close
upon
me
closer
within
reach
of
me
i
could
hear
his
whistling
breaths
and
then
all
at
once
i
was
down
on
hands
and
knees
he
tried
to
avoid
me
failed
and
shooting
high
over
me
thudded
down
upon
the
grass
for
a
moment
he
lay
still
then
with
a
groan
he
rolled
over
and
propping
himself
on
his
arm
thrust
a
hand
into
his
bosom
but
i
hurled
myself
upon
him
and
after
a
brief
struggle
twisted
the
pistol
from
his
grasp
whereupon
he
groaned
again
hurt
i
panted
arm
broke
i
think
he
growled
and
forthwith
burst
out
into
a
torrent
of
curses
does
it
hurt
so
much
i
panted
ah
but
it
ai
that
he
panted
back
it
me
of
you
work
off
a
mouldy
old
trick
on
me
like
that
there
it
was
my
only
chance
said
i
sitting
down
beside
him
to
regain
my
wind
to
think
he
growled
o
me
bein
took
in
by
a
but
you
are
a
great
runner
said
i
a
great
fool
you
mean
to
be
took
in
by
a
you
have
a
long
walk
back
and
your
arm
will
be
painful
and
serve
me
right
for
bein
took
in
by
if
you
will
lend
me
your
neckerchief
i
think
i
can
make
your
arm
more
comfortable
said
i
he
ceased
cursing
to
stare
at
me
slowly
and
awkwardly
unwound
the
article
in
question
and
passed
it
to
me
thereupon
having
located
the
fracture
i
contrived
a
rough
splint
with
a
piece
of
wood
lying
near
which
done
he
thanked
me
in
a
burst
of
profanity
and
rose
i
see
worse
coves
nor
you
said
he
and
one
good
turn
another
lie
snug
all
day
and
travel
by
night
and
keep
to
the
byroads
this
ai
no
common
case
there
be
a
thousand
pound
on
your
afore
the
week
out
so
look
spry
my
cove
saying
which
he
nodded
turned
upon
his
heel
and
strode
away
cursing
to
himself
now
presently
as
i
went
i
heard
the
merry
ring
and
clink
of
hammer
and
anvil
and
guided
by
the
sound
came
to
a
tumbledown
smithy
where
was
a
man
busily
at
work
with
a
boy
at
the
bellows
at
sight
of
me
the
smith
set
down
his
hammer
and
stared
openmouthed
as
did
also
the
boy
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
file
off
these
shackles
i
inquired
holding
out
my
hands
to
to
file
off
yes
why
that
that
depends
then
do
it
as
soon
as
you
can
upon
this
the
man
turned
his
back
to
me
and
began
rummaging
among
his
tools
with
his
head
very
near
that
of
the
boy
until
having
found
a
file
suitable
to
the
purpose
he
set
to
work
upon
my
handcuffs
but
he
progressed
so
slowly
for
one
reason
and
another
that
i
began
to
grow
impatient
moreover
noticing
that
the
boy
had
disappeared
i
bade
him
desist
a
cold
chisel
and
hammer
will
be
quickest
said
i
come
cut
me
off
this
chain
here
close
up
to
the
rivets
and
when
he
had
done
this
i
took
his
file
and
thrusting
it
beneath
my
coat
set
off
running
my
hardest
leaving
him
to
stare
after
me
with
his
eyes
and
mouth
wider
than
ever
the
sun
was
down
when
i
reached
the
woods
and
here
in
the
kind
shadows
i
stayed
awhile
to
rest
and
rid
myself
of
my
handcuffs
but
when
i
felt
for
the
file
to
do
so
it
was
gone
chapter
xlvi
how
i
came
to
london
justly
to
narrate
all
that
befell
me
during
my
flight
and
journey
to
london
would
fill
many
pages
and
therefore
as
this
book
of
mine
is
already
of
a
magnitude
far
beyond
my
first
expectations
i
shall
hurry
on
to
the
end
of
my
story
acting
upon
the
advice
of
the
saturnine
jeremy
i
lay
hidden
by
day
and
traveled
by
night
avoiding
the
highway
but
in
so
doing
i
became
so
often
involved
in
the
maze
of
bylanes
and
that
twice
the
dawn
found
me
as
completely
lost
as
though
i
had
been
set
down
in
the
midst
of
the
sahara
i
thus
wasted
much
time
and
wandered
many
miles
out
of
my
way
wherefore
to
put
an
end
to
these
futile
ramblings
i
set
my
face
westward
hoping
to
strike
the
highroad
somewhere
between
tonbridge
and
sevenoaks
determined
rather
to
run
the
extra
chance
of
capture
than
follow
haphazard
these
tortuous
and
interminable
byways
it
was
then
upon
the
third
night
since
my
escape
that
faint
and
spent
with
hunger
i
saw
before
me
the
welcome
sight
of
a
and
hurrying
forward
eager
to
learn
my
whereabouts
came
full
upon
a
man
who
sat
beneath
the
with
a
hunch
of
bread
and
meat
upon
his
knee
which
he
was
eating
by
means
of
a
now
i
had
tasted
nothing
save
two
apples
all
day
and
but
little
the
day
before
thus
at
sight
of
this
appetizing
food
my
hunger
grew
and
increased
to
a
violent
desire
before
which
prudence
vanished
and
caution
flew
away
therefore
i
approached
the
man
with
my
eyes
upon
his
bread
and
meat
but
as
i
drew
nearer
my
attention
was
attracted
by
something
white
that
was
nailed
up
against
the
and
i
stopped
dead
with
my
eyes
riveted
by
a
word
printed
in
great
black
capitals
and
stood
oblivious
alike
of
the
man
who
had
stopped
eating
to
stare
at
me
and
the
bread
and
meat
that
he
had
set
down
upon
the
grass
for
what
i
saw
was
this
murder
reward
whereas
peter
smith
blacksmith
late
of
sissinghurst
in
the
county
of
kent
suspected
of
the
crime
of
wilful
murder
did
upon
the
tenth
of
august
last
make
his
escape
from
his
gaolers
upon
the
tonbridge
road
somewhere
between
sissinghurst
and
pembry
the
above
reward
namely
five
hundred
pounds
will
be
paid
to
such
person
or
persons
who
shall
give
such
information
as
shall
lead
to
the
arrest
and
apprehension
of
the
aforesaid
peter
smith
in
the
furtherance
of
which
is
hereunto
added
a
just
and
close
description
of
the
same
he
is
six
foot
tall
and
a
sizable
rogue
his
hair
black
his
eyes
dark
and
piercing
clad
when
last
seen
in
a
worn
velveteen
jacket
kneebreeches
buckled
at
the
knees
gray
worsted
stockings
and
patched
shoes
the
coat
torn
at
the
right
shoulder
upon
his
wrists
a
pair
of
steel
handcuffs
last
seen
in
the
vicinity
of
pembry
while
i
yet
stared
at
this
i
was
conscious
that
the
man
had
risen
and
now
stood
at
my
elbow
also
that
in
one
hand
his
carried
a
short
heavy
stick
he
stood
very
still
and
with
bent
head
apparently
absorbed
in
the
printed
words
before
him
but
more
than
once
i
saw
his
eyes
gleam
in
the
shadow
of
his
as
they
turned
to
scan
me
furtively
up
and
down
yet
he
did
not
speak
or
move
and
there
was
something
threatening
i
thought
in
his
immobility
wherefore
i
in
turn
watched
him
narrowly
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
and
thus
it
chanced
that
our
glances
met
you
seem
thoughtful
said
i
ah
i
be
that
and
what
might
you
be
thinking
why
since
you
ax
me
i
was
thinkin
as
your
eye
was
mighty
sharp
and
piercin
ah
said
i
and
what
more
that
your
coat
was
tore
at
the
shoulder
so
it
is
i
nodded
well
you
likewise
wears
buckled
breeches
and
gray
worsted
stockings
you
are
a
very
observant
man
said
i
though
to
be
sure
said
he
shaking
his
head
i
do
see
no
that
is
because
they
are
hidden
under
my
sleeves
said
he
and
i
saw
the
stick
quiver
in
his
grip
as
i
said
before
you
are
a
very
observant
man
said
i
watching
the
stick
well
i
got
eyes
and
can
see
as
much
as
most
folk
he
retorted
and
here
the
stick
quivered
again
yes
i
nodded
you
also
possess
legs
and
can
probably
walk
fast
ah
and
run
too
if
need
be
he
added
significantly
then
suppose
you
start
start
where
anywhere
so
long
as
you
do
start
not
you
my
buck
i
took
a
powerful
fancy
to
you
and
that
there
five
hundred
pounds
here
his
left
hand
shot
out
and
grasped
my
collar
so
you
come
along
o
me
and
no
tricks
mind
no
tricks
or
ah
would
ye
the
heavy
stick
whirled
up
but
quick
as
he
i
had
caught
his
wrist
and
now
presented
my
pistol
full
in
his
face
drop
that
stick
said
i
pressing
the
muzzle
of
the
weapon
lightly
against
his
forehead
as
i
spoke
at
the
touch
of
the
cold
steel
his
body
suddenly
stiffened
and
grew
rigid
his
eyes
opened
in
a
horrified
stare
and
the
stick
clattered
down
on
the
road
talking
of
fancies
i
pursued
i
have
a
great
mind
to
that
of
yours
so
take
it
off
and
quick
about
it
in
a
fever
of
haste
he
tore
off
the
garment
in
question
and
he
thrusting
it
eagerly
upon
me
i
folded
it
over
my
arm
now
said
i
since
you
say
you
can
run
supposing
you
show
me
what
you
can
do
this
is
a
good
straight
lane
off
with
you
and
do
your
best
and
no
turning
or
stopping
mind
for
the
moon
is
very
bright
and
i
am
a
pretty
good
shot
hardly
waiting
to
hear
me
out
the
fellow
set
off
up
the
lane
running
like
the
wind
whereupon
i
waiting
only
to
snatch
up
his
forgotten
bread
and
meat
took
to
my
heels
down
the
lane
so
that
when
i
presently
stopped
to
don
the
its
late
possessor
had
vanished
as
though
he
had
never
been
i
hurried
on
nevertheless
eating
greedily
as
i
went
and
after
some
while
left
the
narrow
lane
behind
and
came
out
on
the
broad
highway
that
stretched
like
a
great
white
riband
unrolled
beneath
the
moon
and
here
was
another
with
the
words
to
sevenoaks
tonbridge
and
the
to
bromley
and
london
and
here
also
was
another
placard
headed
by
that
awful
word
murder
which
seemed
to
leap
out
at
me
from
the
rest
and
with
that
word
there
rushed
over
me
the
memory
of
charmian
as
i
had
seen
her
stand
haggard
of
eye
and
with
one
hand
hidden
in
the
folds
of
her
gown
so
i
turned
and
strove
to
flee
from
this
hideous
word
and
as
i
went
i
clenched
my
fists
and
cried
within
myself
i
love
her
love
her
no
doubt
can
come
between
us
more
i
love
her
love
her
love
her
thus
i
hurried
on
along
the
great
highroad
but
wherever
i
looked
i
saw
this
most
hateful
word
it
shone
out
palely
from
the
shadows
it
was
scored
into
the
dust
at
my
feet
even
across
the
splendor
of
the
moon
in
jagged
characters
i
seemed
to
read
that
awful
word
murder
and
the
soft
woke
voices
to
whisper
it
as
i
passed
the
somber
trees
and
gloomy
hedgerows
were
full
of
it
i
heard
it
in
the
echo
of
my
step
murder
murder
it
was
always
there
whether
i
walked
or
ran
in
rough
and
stony
places
in
the
deep
soft
dust
in
the
dewy
tender
grass
it
was
always
there
whispering
at
my
heels
and
refusing
to
be
silenced
i
had
gone
on
in
this
way
for
an
hour
or
more
avoiding
the
middle
of
the
road
because
of
the
brilliance
of
the
moon
when
i
overtook
something
that
crawled
in
the
gloom
of
the
hedge
and
approaching
pistol
in
hand
saw
that
it
was
a
man
he
was
creeping
forward
slowly
and
painfully
on
his
hands
and
knees
but
all
at
once
sank
down
on
his
face
in
the
grass
only
to
rise
groaning
and
creep
on
once
more
and
as
he
went
i
heard
him
praying
lord
give
me
strength
o
lord
give
me
strength
angela
angela
it
is
so
far
so
far
and
groaning
he
sank
down
again
upon
his
face
you
are
ill
said
i
bending
over
him
i
must
reach
deptford
she
buried
at
deptford
and
i
shall
die
o
lord
give
me
strength
he
panted
deptford
is
miles
away
said
i
now
as
i
spoke
he
lifted
himself
upon
his
hands
and
stared
up
at
me
i
saw
a
haggard
hairy
face
very
thin
and
sunken
but
a
fire
burned
in
the
eyes
and
the
eyes
seemed
somehow
familiar
you
he
cried
and
spat
up
in
the
air
towards
me
devil
he
cried
devil
vibart
i
recoiled
instinctively
before
the
man
sudden
wild
ferocity
but
propping
himself
against
the
bank
he
shook
his
hand
at
me
and
laughed
devil
he
repeated
shade
ghost
of
a
devil
have
you
come
back
to
see
me
die
who
are
you
i
cried
bending
to
look
into
the
pale
emaciated
face
who
are
you
a
shadow
he
answered
passing
a
shaking
hand
up
over
his
face
and
brow
a
ghost
a
phantom
as
you
are
but
my
name
was
strickland
once
as
yours
was
devil
vibart
i
am
changed
of
late
you
said
so
in
the
hollow
and
laughed
you
do
laugh
now
devil
vibart
you
remember
poor
john
strickland
now
you
are
the
outside
passenger
i
exclaimed
the
madman
who
followed
and
shot
at
me
in
a
wood
followed
yes
i
was
a
shadow
that
was
always
behind
you
following
and
following
you
satan
vibart
tracking
and
tracking
you
to
hell
and
damnation
and
you
fled
here
and
you
fled
there
but
i
was
always
behind
you
you
hid
from
me
among
lowly
folk
but
you
could
not
escape
the
shadow
many
times
i
would
have
killed
you
but
she
was
between
the
woman
i
came
once
to
your
cottage
it
was
night
and
the
door
opened
beneath
my
hand
but
your
time
was
not
then
but
ha
i
met
you
among
trees
as
i
did
once
before
and
i
told
you
my
name
as
i
did
once
before
and
i
spoke
of
her
of
angela
and
cried
her
name
and
shot
you
just
here
above
the
brow
and
so
you
died
devil
vibart
as
soon
i
must
for
my
mission
is
accomplished
it
was
you
i
cried
kneeling
beside
him
it
was
your
hand
that
shot
sir
maurice
vibart
yes
he
answered
his
voice
growing
very
gentle
as
he
went
on
for
angela
sake
my
dead
wife
and
fumbling
in
his
pocket
he
drew
out
a
woman
small
handkerchief
and
i
saw
that
it
was
thickened
and
black
with
blood
this
was
hers
he
continued
in
her
hand
the
night
she
died
i
had
meant
to
lay
it
on
her
grave
the
blood
of
atonement
but
now
a
sudden
crash
in
the
hedge
above
a
figure
silhouetted
against
the
sky
a
shadowy
arm
that
falling
struck
the
moon
out
of
heaven
and
in
the
darkness
i
was
down
upon
my
knees
and
fingers
were
upon
my
throat
oh
darby
cried
a
voice
i
got
him
this
way
quick
oh
darb
my
fist
drove
into
his
ribs
i
struggled
up
under
a
rain
of
blows
and
we
struck
and
swayed
and
staggered
and
struck
trampling
the
groaning
wretch
who
lay
dying
in
the
ditch
and
before
me
was
the
pale
oval
of
a
face
and
i
smote
it
twice
with
my
and
it
was
gone
and
i
was
running
along
the
road
charmian
spoke
truth
o
god
i
thank
thee
i
burst
through
a
hedge
running
on
and
on
careless
alike
of
being
seen
of
capture
or
escape
of
prison
or
freedom
for
in
my
heart
was
a
great
joy
i
was
conscious
of
shouts
and
cries
but
i
heeded
them
no
more
listening
only
to
the
song
of
happiness
my
heart
was
singing
charmian
spoke
truth
her
hands
are
clean
o
god
i
thank
thee
and
as
i
went
i
presently
espied
a
caravan
and
before
it
a
fire
of
sticks
above
which
a
man
was
bending
who
raising
his
head
stared
at
me
as
i
approached
he
was
a
man
who
glared
at
me
with
one
eye
and
leered
jocosely
with
the
other
and
being
spent
and
short
of
breath
i
stopped
and
wiping
the
sweat
from
my
eyes
i
saw
that
it
was
blood
how
is
lewis
i
panted
what
exclaimed
the
man
drawing
nearer
is
it
you
james
but
you
a
picter
you
are
hallo
he
stopped
as
his
glance
encountered
the
steel
that
glittered
upon
my
wrist
while
upon
the
silence
the
shouts
swelled
drawing
near
and
nearer
so
the
runners
is
arter
you
are
they
young
feller
yes
said
i
yes
you
have
only
to
cry
out
and
they
will
take
me
for
i
can
fight
no
more
nor
run
any
farther
this
knock
on
the
head
has
made
me
very
dizzy
then
take
a
pull
at
this
said
he
and
thrust
a
flat
bottle
into
my
hand
the
fiery
spirit
burned
my
throat
but
almost
immediately
my
strength
and
courage
revived
better
much
better
i
answered
returning
the
bottle
and
i
thank
you
do
go
for
to
thank
young
feller
said
he
driving
the
cork
into
the
bottle
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
you
thank
that
young
feller
as
once
done
as
much
for
me
at
a
fair
an
now
cutaway
run
the
is
good
and
dark
up
yonder
lay
low
a
bit
and
leave
these
damned
runners
to
me
i
obeyed
without
more
ado
and
as
i
ran
up
the
lane
i
heard
him
shouting
and
swearing
as
though
engaged
in
a
desperate
encounter
and
turning
in
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
i
saw
him
met
by
two
men
with
whom
still
shouting
and
gesticulating
excitedly
he
set
off
running
down
the
lane
and
so
i
once
more
turned
my
face
the
blood
still
flowed
from
the
cut
in
my
head
getting
often
into
my
eyes
yet
i
made
good
progress
notwithstanding
but
little
by
little
the
effect
of
the
spirits
wore
off
a
drowsiness
stole
over
me
my
limbs
felt
numbed
and
heavy
and
with
this
came
strange
fancies
and
a
dread
of
the
dark
sometimes
it
seemed
that
odd
lights
danced
before
my
eyes
like
and
strange
voices
gabbled
in
my
ears
furiously
unintelligible
with
laughter
in
a
key
sometimes
i
cast
myself
down
in
the
dewy
grass
only
to
start
up
again
trembling
and
run
on
till
i
was
breathless
but
ever
i
struggled
forward
despite
the
throbbing
of
my
broken
head
and
the
gnawing
hunger
that
consumed
me
after
a
while
a
mist
came
on
a
mist
that
formed
itself
into
deep
valleys
or
rose
in
jagged
spires
and
pinnacles
but
constantly
changing
a
mist
that
moved
and
writhed
within
itself
and
in
this
mist
were
forms
nebulous
and
indistinct
multitudes
that
moved
in
time
with
me
and
the
voices
seemed
louder
than
before
and
the
laughter
much
shriller
while
repeated
over
and
over
again
i
caught
that
awful
word
murder
murder
chief
among
this
host
walked
one
whose
head
and
face
were
muffled
from
my
sight
but
who
watched
me
i
knew
through
the
folds
with
eyes
that
stared
fixed
and
wide
but
now
indeed
the
mist
seemed
to
have
got
into
my
brain
and
all
things
were
hazy
and
my
memory
of
them
is
dim
yet
i
recall
passing
bromley
village
and
slinking
furtively
through
the
shadows
of
the
deserted
high
street
but
thereafter
all
is
blank
save
a
memory
of
pain
and
toil
and
deadly
fatigue
i
was
stumbling
up
steps
the
steps
of
a
terrace
a
great
house
lay
before
me
with
lighted
windows
here
and
there
but
these
i
feared
and
so
came
creeping
to
one
that
i
knew
well
and
whose
dark
panes
glittered
palely
under
the
dying
moon
and
now
i
took
out
my
and
fumbling
blindly
put
back
the
catch
as
i
had
often
done
as
a
boy
and
so
the
window
opening
i
clambered
into
the
dimness
beyond
now
as
i
stumbled
forward
my
hand
touched
something
a
long
dark
object
that
was
covered
with
a
cloth
and
hardly
knowing
what
i
did
i
drew
back
this
cloth
and
looked
down
at
that
which
it
had
covered
and
sank
down
upon
my
knees
groaning
for
there
staring
up
at
me
cold
contemptuous
and
set
like
marble
was
the
smiling
dead
face
of
my
cousin
maurice
as
i
knelt
there
i
was
conscious
that
the
door
had
opened
that
some
one
approached
bearing
a
light
but
i
did
not
move
or
heed
peter
good
god
in
heaven
is
it
peter
i
looked
up
and
into
the
dilated
eyes
of
sir
richard
is
it
really
peter
he
whispered
yes
sir
dying
i
think
no
no
peter
dear
boy
he
stammered
you
did
know
you
heard
poor
maurice
murdered
fellow
name
of
smith
yes
sir
richard
i
know
more
about
it
than
most
you
see
i
am
peter
smith
sir
richard
fell
back
from
me
and
i
saw
the
candle
swaying
in
his
grasp
you
he
whispered
you
oh
peter
oh
my
boy
but
i
am
innocent
innocent
you
believe
me
you
who
were
my
earliest
friend
my
good
kind
friend
you
believe
me
and
i
stretched
out
my
hands
appealingly
but
as
i
did
so
the
light
fell
gleaming
upon
my
shameful
wristlets
and
even
as
we
gazed
into
each
other
eyes
mute
and
breathless
came
the
sound
of
steps
and
hushed
voices
sir
richard
sprang
forward
and
catching
me
in
a
powerful
hand
half
led
half
dragged
me
behind
a
tall
leather
screen
beside
the
hearth
and
thrusting
me
into
a
chair
turned
and
hurried
to
meet
the
intruders
they
were
three
as
i
soon
discovered
by
their
voices
one
of
which
i
thought
i
recognized
it
a
devilish
shame
the
first
was
saying
not
a
soul
here
for
the
funeral
but
our
four
selves
i
say
it
a
shame
a
burning
shame
that
sir
depends
entirely
on
the
point
of
view
answered
the
second
a
somewhat
aggressive
voice
and
this
it
was
i
seemed
to
recognize
point
of
view
sir
where
i
should
like
to
know
are
all
those
smiling
nonentities
those
fawning
sycophants
who
were
once
so
proud
of
his
patronage
who
openly
modelled
themselves
upon
him
whose
highest
ambition
was
to
be
called
a
friend
of
the
famous
vibart
where
are
they
now
doing
the
same
by
the
present
favorite
as
is
the
nature
of
their
kind
responded
the
third
poor
maurice
is
already
forgotten
the
prince
said
the
harsh
voice
the
prince
would
never
have
forgiven
him
for
crossing
him
in
the
affair
of
the
lady
sophia
sefton
the
day
he
ran
off
with
her
he
was
as
surely
dead
in
a
social
sense
as
he
is
now
in
every
sense
here
the
mist
settled
down
upon
my
brain
once
more
and
i
heard
nothing
but
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
back
on
the
road
again
hemmed
in
by
those
gibbering
phantoms
that
spoke
so
much
and
yet
said
but
one
word
murder
quick
a
candle
here
a
candle
bring
a
light
there
came
a
glare
before
my
smarting
eyes
and
i
struggled
up
to
my
feet
why
i
have
seen
this
fellow
face
somewhere
ah
yes
at
an
inn
a
rogue
i
threatened
to
pull
his
nose
i
remember
and
by
heaven
handcuffs
he
has
been
roughly
handled
too
gentlemen
lay
my
life
the
murderer
is
found
though
how
he
should
come
here
of
all
places
extraordinary
sir
richard
you
and
i
as
magistrates
duty
but
the
mist
was
very
thick
and
the
voices
grew
confused
again
only
i
knew
that
hands
were
upon
me
that
i
was
led
into
another
room
where
were
lights
that
glittered
upon
the
silver
the
decanters
and
glasses
of
a
supper
table
yes
i
was
saying
slowly
and
heavily
yes
i
am
peter
smith
a
blacksmith
who
escaped
from
his
gaolers
on
the
tonbridge
road
but
i
am
innocent
before
god
i
am
innocent
and
now
do
with
me
as
you
will
for
i
am
very
weary
sir
richard
arm
was
about
me
and
his
voice
sounded
in
my
ears
but
as
though
a
great
way
off
sirs
said
he
this
is
my
friend
sir
peter
vibart
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
a
chair
fell
with
a
crash
and
there
rose
a
confusion
of
excited
voices
which
grew
suddenly
silent
for
the
door
had
opened
and
on
the
threshold
stood
a
woman
tall
and
proud
and
richly
dressed
from
the
little
dusty
boot
that
peeped
beneath
her
habit
to
the
that
shaded
the
high
beauty
of
her
face
and
i
would
have
gone
to
her
but
that
my
strength
failed
me
charmian
she
started
and
turning
uttered
a
cry
and
ran
to
me
charmian
said
i
oh
charmian
and
so
with
her
tender
arms
about
me
and
her
kisses
on
my
lips
the
mist
settled
down
upon
me
thicker
and
darker
than
ever
chapter
xlvii
in
which
this
history
is
ended
a
bright
room
luxuriously
appointed
a
great
wide
bed
with
carved
posts
and
embroidered
canopy
between
the
curtained
windows
a
tall
oak
press
with
grotesque
heads
carved
thereon
heads
that
leered
and
gaped
and
scowled
at
me
but
the
bed
and
the
room
and
the
oak
press
were
all
familiar
and
the
grotesque
heads
had
leered
and
gaped
and
frowned
at
me
before
and
haunted
my
boyish
dreams
many
and
many
a
night
and
now
i
lay
between
sleeping
and
waking
staring
dreamily
at
all
these
things
till
roused
by
a
voice
near
by
and
starting
up
broad
awake
beheld
sir
richard
deuce
take
you
peter
he
exclaimed
i
say
the
devil
fly
away
with
you
my
boy
curse
me
a
nice
pickle
you
made
of
yourself
with
your
infernal
revolutionary
notions
your
digging
and
blacksmithing
your
where
is
she
sir
richard
i
broke
in
pray
where
is
she
she
he
returned
scratching
his
chin
with
the
corner
of
a
letter
he
held
she
she
whom
i
saw
last
night
you
were
asleep
last
night
and
the
night
before
asleep
then
how
long
have
i
been
here
three
days
peter
and
where
is
she
surely
i
have
not
dreamed
it
all
where
is
charmian
she
went
away
this
morning
gone
where
to
gad
peter
how
should
i
know
but
seeing
the
distress
in
my
face
he
smiled
and
tendered
me
the
letter
she
left
this
peter
when
he
awoke
and
i
been
waiting
for
peter
to
wake
all
the
morning
hastily
i
broke
the
seal
and
unfolding
the
paper
with
tremulous
hands
read
dearest
noblest
and
most
disbelieving
of
peters
oh
did
you
think
you
could
hide
your
hateful
suspicion
from
me
from
me
who
know
you
so
well
i
felt
it
in
your
kiss
in
the
touch
of
your
strong
hand
i
saw
it
in
your
eyes
even
when
i
told
you
the
truth
and
begged
you
to
believe
me
even
then
deep
down
in
your
heart
you
thought
it
was
my
hand
that
had
killed
sir
maurice
and
god
only
knows
the
despair
that
filled
me
as
i
turned
and
left
you
and
so
peter
perhaps
to
punish
you
a
little
perhaps
because
i
can
not
bear
the
noisy
world
just
yet
perhaps
because
i
fear
you
a
little
i
have
run
away
but
i
remember
also
how
believing
me
guilty
you
loved
me
still
and
gave
yourself
up
to
shield
me
and
dying
of
hunger
and
fatigue
came
to
find
me
and
so
peter
i
have
not
run
so
very
far
nor
hidden
myself
so
very
close
and
if
you
understand
me
as
you
should
your
search
need
not
be
so
very
long
and
dear
dear
peter
there
is
just
one
other
thing
which
i
hoped
that
you
would
guess
which
any
other
would
have
guessed
but
which
being
a
philosopher
you
never
did
guess
oh
peter
i
was
once
very
long
ago
it
seems
sophia
charmian
sefton
but
i
am
now
and
always
was
your
humble
person
charmian
the
letter
fell
from
my
fingers
and
i
remained
staring
before
me
so
long
that
sir
richard
came
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
oh
boy
said
he
very
tenderly
she
has
told
me
all
the
story
and
i
think
peter
i
think
it
is
given
to
very
few
men
to
win
the
love
of
such
a
woman
as
this
god
knows
it
said
i
and
to
have
married
one
so
very
noble
and
high
in
all
things
you
should
be
very
proud
peter
i
am
said
i
oh
i
am
sir
even
peter
even
though
she
be
a
virago
this
lady
sophia
or
a
termagant
i
was
a
great
fool
in
those
days
said
i
hanging
my
head
and
very
young
it
was
only
six
months
ago
peter
but
i
am
years
older
today
sir
and
the
husband
of
the
most
glorious
woman
the
most
oh
curse
me
peter
if
you
deserve
such
a
goddess
and
she
worked
for
me
said
i
cooked
and
served
and
mended
my
clothes
where
are
they
i
cried
and
sprang
out
of
bed
what
the
deuce
began
sir
richard
my
clothes
said
i
looking
vainly
about
my
clothes
pray
sir
richard
where
are
they
burnt
peter
burnt
every
rag
he
nodded
her
orders
but
what
am
i
to
do
sir
richard
laughed
and
crossing
to
the
press
opened
the
door
here
are
all
the
things
you
left
behind
you
when
you
set
out
to
dig
and
egad
make
your
fortune
i
could
let
go
with
all
the
rest
so
i
er
had
brought
here
to
er
to
keep
them
for
you
ready
for
the
time
when
you
should
grow
tired
of
digging
and
come
back
to
me
and
er
oh
dammit
you
understand
and
waiting
to
see
you
in
the
library
been
there
hours
so
dress
yourself
in
heaven
name
dress
yourself
he
cried
and
hurried
from
the
room
it
was
with
a
certain
satisfaction
that
i
once
more
donned
buckskin
and
spurred
boots
and
noticed
moreover
how
tight
my
coat
was
become
across
the
shoulders
yet
i
dressed
hastily
for
my
mind
was
already
on
the
road
galloping
to
charmian
in
the
library
i
found
sir
richard
and
grainger
who
greeted
me
with
his
precise
little
bow
i
have
to
congratulate
you
sir
peter
he
began
not
only
on
your
distinguished
marriage
and
accession
to
fortune
but
upon
the
fact
that
the
ah
unpleasantness
connecting
a
certain
peter
smith
with
your
unfortunate
cousin
late
decease
has
been
entirely
removed
by
means
of
the
murderer
written
confession
placed
in
my
hands
some
days
ago
by
the
lady
sophia
a
written
confession
and
she
brought
it
to
you
galloped
all
the
way
from
tonbridge
by
gad
nodded
sir
richard
it
seems
pursued
grainger
that
the
ah
man
john
strickland
by
name
lodged
with
a
certain
preacher
to
whom
in
lady
presence
he
confessed
his
crime
and
willingly
wrote
out
a
deposition
to
that
effect
it
also
appears
that
the
man
sick
though
he
was
wandered
from
the
preacher
cottage
and
was
eventually
found
upon
the
road
and
now
lies
in
maidstone
gaol
in
a
dying
condition
chancing
presently
to
look
from
the
window
i
beheld
a
groom
who
led
a
horse
up
and
down
before
the
door
and
the
groom
was
adam
and
the
horse
i
opened
the
window
and
leaning
out
called
a
name
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
the
man
smiled
and
touched
his
hat
and
the
mare
ceased
her
pawing
and
chafing
and
turned
upon
me
a
pair
of
great
soft
eyes
and
snuffed
the
air
and
whinnied
so
i
leapt
out
of
the
window
and
down
the
steps
and
thus
it
was
that
i
met
wings
she
be
in
the
pink
o
condition
sir
said
adam
proudly
sir
richard
bought
for
a
song
added
the
baronet
who
with
grainger
had
followed
to
bid
me
i
really
got
her
remarkably
cheap
he
explained
thrusting
his
fists
deep
into
his
pockets
and
frowning
down
my
thanks
but
when
i
had
swung
myself
into
the
saddle
he
came
and
laid
his
hand
upon
my
knee
you
are
going
to
find
her
peter
yes
sir
and
you
know
where
to
look
i
think
so
because
if
you
do
i
might
i
shall
go
to
a
certain
cottage
said
i
tentatively
then
you
better
go
boy
the
mare
all
excitement
peter
and
cutting
up
my
gravel
most
damnably
so
saying
he
reached
up
and
gripped
my
hand
very
hard
and
stared
at
me
also
very
hard
though
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
i
always
felt
very
fatherly
towards
you
peter
and
you
wo
forget
the
lonely
old
man
come
and
see
me
now
and
then
both
of
you
for
it
does
get
damnably
lonely
here
sometimes
and
oh
curse
it
goodby
dear
lad
so
he
turned
and
walked
up
the
steps
into
his
great
lonely
house
o
wings
with
thy
slender
grace
and
tireless
strength
if
ever
thou
didst
gallop
before
do
thy
best
spurn
spurn
the
dust
thy
fleet
hoofs
stretch
thy
graceful
arab
neck
bear
me
gallantly
o
wings
for
never
shalt
thou
and
i
see
its
like
again
swift
we
flew
with
the
wind
before
and
the
dust
behind
past
wayside
inns
where
besmocked
figures
paused
in
their
grave
discussions
to
turn
and
watch
us
by
past
smiling
field
and
darkling
copse
past
lonely
cottage
and
village
green
through
sevenoaks
and
tonbridge
with
never
a
stop
up
pembry
hill
and
down
galloping
so
lightly
so
easily
over
that
hard
familiar
road
which
i
had
lately
tramped
with
so
much
toil
and
pain
and
so
as
evening
fell
to
sissinghurst
a
dreamy
sleepy
place
is
sissinghurst
at
all
times
for
its
few
cottages
like
its
inn
are
very
old
and
great
age
begets
dreams
but
when
the
sun
is
low
and
the
shadows
creep
out
when
the
old
inn
blinks
drowsy
eyes
at
the
cottages
and
they
blink
back
drowsily
at
the
inn
like
the
old
friends
they
are
when
distant
cows
low
at
gates
and
fences
when
tinkle
faintly
when
the
weary
toiler
seated
sideways
on
his
weary
horse
fares
homewards
nodding
sleepily
with
every
plodding
but
rousing
to
give
one
a
drowsy
good
night
then
who
can
resist
the
somnolent
charm
of
the
place
save
only
the
bull
himself
snorting
down
in
lofty
contempt
as
rolling
of
eye
as
curly
of
horn
as
stiff
as
to
tail
as
any
indignant
bull
ever
was
or
shall
be
but
as
i
rode
watching
the
evening
deepen
about
me
soft
and
clear
rose
the
merry
chime
of
hammer
and
anvil
and
turning
aside
to
the
smithy
i
paused
there
and
stooping
my
head
looked
in
at
the
door
george
said
i
he
started
erect
and
dropping
hammer
and
tongs
came
out
running
then
stopped
suddenly
as
one
abashed
oh
friend
said
i
do
you
know
me
why

he
stammered
and
broke
off

and
leaping
from

saddle

hand
in
mine
but
he
drew
back

so
fine

peter
george
said
i
do
be
a
fool
now
as
we
stood
thus
fronting
each
other
in
the
doorway
i
heard
a
light
step
upon
the
road
behind
me
and
turning
beheld
prudence
oh
prue
george
is
afraid
of
my
clothes
and
wo
shake
hands
with
me
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
then
all
at
once
laughing
a
little
and
blushing
a
little
she
leaned
forward
and
kissed
me
why
george
said
she
still
blushing
how
fulish
you
be
peter

as
much
a
gentleman
in
his
leather
apron
as
ever
he
is
in
his
fine
coat
how
fulish
you
be
george
so
proud
george
gave
me
his
hand
all
grimy
as
it
was
rejoicing
over
me
because
of
my
good
fortune
and
mourning
over
me
because
my
smithing
days
were
over
ye
see
peter
when
men
worked
together
and
sorrowed
together
an
together
an
knocked
each
other
down
like
you
me
it
bea
so
easy
to
say
so
if
you
must
leave
us
why
do
let
say
it
no
george
there
shall
be
no
for
either
one
of
us
and
i
shall
come
back
soon
until
then
take
my
mare
have
her
made
comfortable
for
me
and
now
good
night
good
night
and
so
clasping
their
loving
hands
i
turned
away
somewhat
hurriedly
and
left
them
there
was
no
moon
but
the
night
was
luminous
with
stars
and
as
i
strode
along
my
eyes
were
often
lifted
to
the
wonder
of
the
heavens
and
i
wondered
which
particular
star
was
charmian
and
which
mine
reaching
the
hollow
i
paused
to
glance
about
me
as
i
ever
did
before
descending
that
leafy
path
and
the
shadows
were
very
black
and
a
chill
wind
stirred
among
the
leaves
so
that
i
shivered
and
wondered
for
the
first
time
if
i
had
come
right
if
the
cottage
had
been
in
charmian
mind
when
she
wrote
then
i
descended
the
path
hurrying
past
a
certain
dark
spot
and
coming
at
last
within
sight
of
the
cottage
i
paused
again
and
shivered
again
for
the
windows
were
dark
and
the
door
shut
but
the
latch
yielded
readily
beneath
my
hand
so
i
went
in
and
closed
and
barred
the
door
behind
me
for
upon
the
hearth
a
fire
burned
with
a
dim
red
glow
that
filled
the
place
with
shadows
and
the
shadows
were
very
deep
charmian
said
i
oh
charmian
are
you
there
have
i
guessed
right
i
heard
a
rustle
close
beside
me
and
in
the
gloom
came
a
hand
to
meet
and
clasp
my
own
wherefore
i
stooped
and
kissed
those
slender
fingers
drawing
her
into
the
fireglow
and
her
eyes
were
hidden
by
their
lashes
and
the
glow
of
the
fire
seemed
reflected
in
her
cheeks
the
candles
were
so
bright
peter
she
whispered
yes
and
so
when
i
heard
you
coming
you
heard
me
i
was
sitting
on
the
bench
outside
peter
and
when
you
heard
me
you
put
the
candles
out
they
seemed
so
very
bright
peter
and
shut
the
door
i
only
just
closed
it
peter
she
was
still
wrapped
in
her
cloak
as
she
had
been
when
i
first
saw
her
wherefore
i
put
back
the
hood
from
her
face
and
behold
as
i
did
so
her
hair
fell
down
rippling
over
my
arm
and
covering
us
both
in
its
splendor
as
it
had
done
once
before
indeed
you
have
glorious
hair
said
i
it
seems
wonderful
to
think
that
you
are
my
wife
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
even
yet
why
i
had
meant
you
should
marry
me
from
the
first
peter
had
you
do
you
think
i
should
ever
have
come
back
to
this
dear
solitude
otherwise
now
when
i
would
have
kissed
her
she
turned
her
head
aside
peter
yes
charmian
the
lady
sophia
sefton
never
did
gallop
her
horse
up
the
steps
of
paul
cathedral
did
she
charmian
and
she
could
help
her
name
being
bandied
from
mouth
to
mouth
or
out
over
slopping
wineglasses
could
she
no
said
i
frowning
what
a
young
fool
i
was
and
peter
well
charmian
she
never
was
and
never
will
be
buxom
or
strapping
will
she
is
such
a
hateful
word
peter
and
you
love
her
wait
peter
as
much
as
ever
you
loved
charmian
brown
yes
said
i
yes
and
nearly
as
much
as
your
dream
woman
more
much
more
because
you
are
the
embodiment
of
all
my
dreams
you
always
will
be
charmian
because
i
honor
you
for
your
intellect
and
worship
you
for
your
gentleness
and
spotless
purity
and
love
you
with
all
my
strength
for
your
warm
sweet
womanhood
and
because
you
are
so
strong
and
beautiful
and
proud
and
because
peter
because
i
am
just
your
loving
humble
person
and
thus
it
was
i
went
forth
a
fool
and
toiled
and
suffered
and
loved
and
in
the
end
got
me
some
little
wisdom
and
thus
did
i
all
unworthy
as
i
am
win
the
heart
of
a
noble
woman
whose
love
i
pray
will
endure
even
as
mine
will
when
we
shall
have
journeyed
to
the
end
of
this
broad
highway
which
is
life
and
into
the
mystery
of
the
beyond
