years
ago
a
few
farmers
families
near
greenfield
michigan
heard
that
there
was
another
baby
at
the
fords
a
boy
mother
and
son
were
doing
well
they
were
going
to
name
the
boy
henry
years
later
a
little
neighborhood
on
the
edge
of
detroit
was
amused
to
hear
that
the
man
ford
who
had
just
built
the
little
white
house
on
the
corner
had
a
notion
that
he
could
invent
something
he
was
always
puttering
away
in
the
old
shed
back
of
the
house
sometimes
he
worked
all
night
there
the
neighbors
saw
the
light
burning
through
the
cracks
twelve
years
ago
half
a
dozen
men
in
detroit
were
actually
driving
the
ford
automobile
about
the
streets
ford
had
started
a
small
factory
with
a
dozen
mechanics
and
was
buying
material
it
was
freely
predicted
that
the
venture
would
never
come
to
much
year
january
america
was
startled
by
an
announcement
from
the
ford
factory
that
ten
million
dollars
would
be
divided
among
the
eighteen
thousand
employees
as
their
share
of
the
company
profits
henry
ford
was
a
multimillionaire
and
america
regarded
him
with
mankind
must
have
its
hero
the
demand
for
him
is
more
insistent
than
hunger
more
inexorable
than
cold
or
fear
before
a
race
builds
houses
or
prepares
food
with
its
hands
it
creates
in
its
mind
that
demigod
that
superman
standing
on
a
higher
plane
than
the
rest
of
humanity
more
admirable
more
powerful
than
the
others
we
must
have
him
as
a
symbol
of
something
greater
than
ourselves
to
keep
alive
in
us
that
faith
in
life
which
is
threatened
by
our
own
experience
of
living
he
is
at
once
our
greatest
solace
and
our
worst
enemy
we
cling
to
him
as
a
child
clings
to
a
guiding
hand
unable
to
walk
without
it
and
never
able
to
walk
alone
until
it
is
let
go
every
advance
of
democracy
destroys
our
old
hero
and
hastily
we
build
up
another
when
science
has
exorcised
jove
and
real
estate
promoters
have
subdivided
the
olympian
heights
we
desert
the
old
altars
to
kneel
before
thrones
when
our
kings
have
been
cast
down
from
their
high
places
by
our
inconsistent
struggles
for
liberty
we
can
not
leave
those
high
places
empty
we
found
a
government
on
the
bold
declaration
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
but
we
do
not
believe
it
out
of
the
material
at
hand
we
must
create
again
our
great
ones
so
with
the
growth
of
big
business
during
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
we
have
built
up
the
modern
myth
of
the
big
business
man
our
imaginations
are
intrigued
by
the
spectacle
of
his
rise
from
our
ranks
yesterday
he
was
a
farmer
son
an
office
boy
a
peddler
of
armenian
laces
he
is
a
demigod
is
our
country
threatened
with
financial
ruin
at
a
midnight
conference
of
his
dependents
hastily
called
he
speaks
one
word
we
are
saved
does
a
foreign
nation
fighting
for
its
life
ask
our
help
he
endorses
the
loan
we
contemplate
him
with
awe
in
one
lifetime
he
has
made
himself
a
world
power
in
twenty
years
he
has
made
a
hundred
million
dollars
we
say
he
is
a
big
business
man
tendency
was
immediately
to
put
henry
ford
in
that
class
he
does
not
belong
to
it
he
is
not
a
big
business
man
he
is
a
big
man
in
it
is
not
strange
with
this
belief
of
millions
of
persons
that
the
men
who
have
been
at
the
head
of
our
great
business
development
are
greater
than
ordinary
men
that
most
of
them
believe
it
themselves
and
act
on
that
assumption
henry
ford
does
not
his
greatness
lies
in
that
with
millions
piling
upon
millions
in
our
hands
most
of
us
would
lose
our
viewpoint
he
has
kept
his
a
plain
mechanic
outlook
on
life
and
human
relations
he
sees
men
all
as
parts
of
a
great
machine
in
which
every
waste
motion
every
broken
or
inefficient
part
means
a
loss
to
the
whole
money
does
do
me
any
good
he
says
i
ca
spend
it
on
myself
money
has
no
value
anyway
it
is
merely
a
transmitter
like
electricity
i
try
to
keep
it
moving
as
fast
as
i
can
for
the
best
interests
of
everybody
concerned
a
man
ca
afford
to
look
out
for
himself
at
the
expense
of
any
one
else
because
anything
that
hurts
the
other
man
is
bound
to
hurt
you
in
the
end
the
same
way
the
story
of
henry
ford
is
the
story
of
his
coming
to
that
conclusion
and
of
his
building
up
an
annual
business

chapter
i
one
summer
day
it
was
a
hot
sultry
day
in
the
last
of
july
one
of
those
eastern
summer
days
when
the
air
presses
heavily
down
on
the
stifling
country
fields
and
in
every
farmyard
the
chickens
scratch
deep
on
the
shady
side
of
buildings
looking
for
cool
earth
to
lie
upon
panting
this
weather
wo
hold
long
william
ford
said
that
morning
giving
the
big
bay
a
friendly
slap
and
fastening
the
trace
as
she
stepped
over
we
better
get
the
hay
under
cover
before
night
there
was
no
sign
of
a
cloud
in
the
bright
hot
sky
but
none
of
the
hired
men
disputed
him
william
ford
was
a
good
farmer
thrifty
and
every
field
of
his
farm
was
well
cared
for
yielding
richly
every
year
his
cattle
were
fat
and
sleek
his
big
red
barns
the
best
filled
in
the
neighborhood
he
was
not
the
man
to
let
ten
acres
of
good
hay
get
caught
in
a
summer
shower
and
spoil
they
put
the
big
on
the
wagon
threw
in
the
stone
water
jugs
filled
with
cool
water
from
the
well
near
the
kitchen
door
and
drove
out
to
the
meadow
one
imagines
them
working
there
lifting
great
forksful
of
the
hay
tossing
them
into
the
rack
where
on
the
rising
mound
the
youngest
man
was
kept
busy
shifting
and
settling
them
with
his
fork
grasshoppers
whirred
up
from
the
winrows
of
the
dried
grass
when
they
were
disturbed
and
quails
called
from
the
fence
corners
now
and
then
the
men
stopped
to
wipe
the
sweat
from
their
foreheads
and
to
take
long
swallows
from
the
water
jugs
hidden
for
coolness
under
a
mound
of
hay
then
with
a
look
at
the
sky
they
took
up
their
forks
william
ford
worked
with
the
others
doing
a
good
day
task
with
the
best
of
them
and
proud
of
it
he
was
the
owner
and
they
were
the
hired
men
but
on
a
michigan
farm
the
measure
of
a
man
is
the
part
he
takes
in
man
work
in
the
cities
where
men
work
against
men
let
them
build
up
artificial
distinctions
on
the
farm
the
fight
is
against
nature
and
men
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
it
a
dark
cloud
was
coming
up
in
the
northwest
and
every
man
muscles
leaped
to
the
need
for
getting
in
the
hay
suddenly
they
heard
a
clang
from
the
great
bell
hung
high
on
a
post
in
the
home
dooryard
and
used
only
for
calling
in
the
men
at
dinnertime
or
for
some
emergency
alarm
every
man
stopped
it
was
only
then
they
saw
a
fluttering
apron
at
the
barnyard
gate
and
william
ford
dropped
his
fork
i
go
get
in
the
hay
he
called
back
already
running
over
the
stubble
in
long
strides
the
men
stared
a
minute
longer
and
then
turned
back
to
work
a
little
more
slowly
this
time
with
the
boss
gone
a
few
minutes
later
they
stopped
again
to
watch
him
riding
out
of
the
home
yard
and
down
the
road
urging
the
little
gray
mare
to
a
run
going
for
doc
hall
they
surmised
they
got
in
a
few
more
loads
of
hay
before
the
rain
came
spattering
in
big
drops
on
their
straw
hats
and
making
a
pleasant
rustling
on
the
thirsty
meadows
then
they
climbed
into
the
rack
and
drove
down
to
the
big
barn
they
sat
idly
there
in
the
dimness
watching
through
the
wide
doors
the
gray
slant
of
the
rain
the
doctor
had
come
one
of
the
men
unhitched
his
horse
and
led
it
into
a
stall
while
another
pulled
the
light
cart
under
the
shed
dinner
time
came
and
passed
there
was
no
call
from
the
house
and
they
did
not
go
in
once
in
a
while
they
laughed
nervously
and
remarked
that
it
was
a
shame
they
did
not
save
the
last
three
loads
of
hay
good
hay
too
ran
a
full
four
tons
to
the
acre
about
in
the
afternoon
the
rain
changed
to
a
light
drizzle
and
the
clouds
broke
later
william
ford
came
out
of
the
house
and
crossed
the
soppy
yard
he
was
grinning
a
little
it
was
all
right
he
said
a
boy
i
believe
they
had
up
a
jug
of
sweet
cider
from
the
cellar
in
honor
of
the
occasion
i
know
that
when
they
apologetically
mentioned
the
spoiled
hay
he
laughed
heartily
and
asked
what
they
supposed
he
cared
about
the
hay
what
you
going
to
call
him
ford
one
of
the
men
asked
him
as
they
stood
around
the
cider
jug
wiping
their
lips
on
the
backs
of
their
hands
the
wife
named
him
already
henry
he
said
well
he
have
his
share
of
one
of
the
finest
farms
in
michigan
one
of
these
days
they
said
and
while
william
ford
said
nothing
he
must
have
looked
over
his
green
rolling
acres
with
a
pardonable
pride
reflecting
that
the
new
need
never
want
for
anything
in
reason
henry
was
the
second
son
of
william
ford
and
mary
litogot
ford
his
energetic
wholesome
holland
dutch
wife
while
he
was
still
in
pinafores
tumbling
about
the
house
or
making
daring
excursions
into
the
barnyard
the
stronghold
of
the
dreadful
turkey
gobbler
his
sister
margaret
was
born
and
henry
had
barely
been
promoted
to
real
trousers
at
the
age
of
four
when
another
brother
arrived
four
babies
to
be
bathed
clothed
taught
loved
and
guarded
from
all
the
childish
disasters
to
be
encountered
about
the
farm
might
well
be
thought
enough
to
fill
any
woman
mind
and
hands
but
there
were
a
thousand
additional
tasks
for
the
mistress
of
that
large
household
there
was
milk
to
skim
butter
and
cheese
to
make
poultry
and
garden
to
be
tended
patchwork
quilts
to
sew
and
later
to
fasten
into
the
quilting
frames
and
stitch
by
hand
in
herringbone
or
fan
patterns
the
hired
hands
must
be
fed
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
in
harvesting
time
pickles
jams
jellies
sweet
cider
vinegar
must
be
made
and
stored
away
on
the
cellar
shelves
when
the
hogs
were
killed
in
the
fall
there
were
sausages
pickled
pigs
feet
to
prepare
hams
and
shoulders
to
be
soaked
in
brine
and
smoked
onions
peppers
popcorn
to
be
braided
in
long
strips
and
hung
in
the
attic
while
every
day
bread
cake
and
pies
must
be
baked
and
the
house
kept
in
that
order
so
dear
to
the
pride
of
the
michigan
farmers
all
these
tasks
mary
ford
did
or
superintended
efficiently
looking
to
the
ways
of
her
household
with
all
the
care
and
pride
her
husband
had
in
managing
the
farm
she
found
time
too
to
be
neighborly
to
visit
her
friends
care
for
one
of
them
who
fell
ill
help
any
one
in
the
little
community
who
needed
it
and
always
she
watched
over
the
health
and
manners
of
the
children
in
this
environment
henry
grew
he
was
energetic
interested
in
everything
from
the
first
his
misadventures
in
conquering
the
turkey
gobbler
would
fill
a
chapter
when
he
was
a
little
older
one
of
the
hired
men
would
put
him
on
the
back
of
a
big
farm
horse
and
let
him
ride
around
the
barnyard
or
perhaps
he
was
allowed
to
carry
a
spiced
drink
of
vinegar
and
water
to
the
men
working
in
the
harvest
field
he
learned
every
corner
of
the
and
had
a
serious
interview
with
his
father
over
the
matter
of
sliding
down
the
in
the
winters
wrapped
in
a
knit
muffler
with
mittens
of
his
mother
making
on
his
hands
he
played
in
the
snow
or
spent
whole
afternoons
sliding
on
the
ice
with
his
brothers
best
of
all
he
liked
the
shop
where
the
blacksmith
work
for
the
farm
was
done
and
the
sharpening
of
tools
when
the
weather
was
bad
outside
his
father
or
one
of
the
men
lighted
the
charcoal
in
the
forge
and
henry
might
pull
the
bellows
till
the
fire
glowed
and
the
iron
buried
in
it
shone
then
the
sparks
flew
from
the
anvil
while
the
great
hammer
clanged
on
the
metal
shaping
it
and
henry
begged
to
be
allowed
to
try
it
himself
just
once
in
time
he
was
given
a
small
hammer
of
his
own
so
the
years
passed
until
henry
was
years
old
and
then
a
momentous
event
occurred
small
enough
in
itself
but
to
this
day
one
of
the
keenest
memories
of
his
childhood
chapter
ii
mending
a
watch
this
first
memorable
event
of
henry
ford
childhood
occurred
on
a
sunday
in
the
spring
of
his
eleventh
year
in
that
household
sunday
as
a
matter
of
course
was
a
day
of
stiffly
starched
propriety
for
the
children
and
of
idleness
for
the
elders
in
the
morning
the
fat
driving
horses
brushed
till
their
glossy
coats
shone
in
the
sun
were
hitched
to
the
carriage
and
the
family
drove
to
church
william
and
mary
ford
were
episcopalians
and
henry
was
reared
in
that
faith
although
both
then
and
later
he
showed
little
enthusiasm
for
sitting
through
the
long
service
in
the
stuffy
little
church
uncomfortably
conscious
of
his
garments
sternly
forbidden
to
fidget
while
outside
were
all
the
sights
and
sounds
of
a
country
spring
must
have
seemed
a
wanton
waste
of
time
to
small
henry
to
this
day
he
has
not
greatly
changed
that
opinion
religion
like
everything
else
is
a
thing
that
should
be
kept
working
he
says
i
see
no
use
in
spending
a
great
deal
of
time
learning
about
heaven
and
hell
in
my
opinion
a
man
makes
his
own
heaven
and
hell
and
carries
it
around
with
him
both
of
them
are
states
of
mind
on
this
particular
sunday
morning
henry
was
more
than
usually
rebellious
it
was
the
first
week
he
had
been
allowed
to
leave
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
for
the
summer
and
henry
had
all
a
country
ardor
for
going
barefoot
to
cramp
his
joyously
liberated
toes
again
into
stuffy
leather
shoes
seemed
to
him
an
outrage
he
resented
his
white
collar
too
and
the
immaculate
little
suit
his
mother
cautioned
him
to
keep
clean
he
was
not
sullen
about
it
he
merely
remarked
frankly
that
he
hated
their
old
sunday
anyhow
and
wished
never
to
see
another
mother
and
father
and
the
four
children
set
out
for
church
as
usual
at
the
hitching
posts
where
william
ford
tied
the
horses
before
going
in
to
the
church
they
met
their
neighbors
the
bennetts
will
bennett
a
youngster
about
henry
age
hailed
him
from
the
other
carriage
hi
hen
i
got
something
you
ai
got
henry
scrambled
out
over
the
wheel
and
hurried
to
see
what
it
might
be
it
was
a
watch
a
real
watch
as
large
and
shiny
as
his
father
henry
looked
at
it
with
awed
admiration
and
then
with
envy
it
was
will
own
watch
his
grandfather
had
given
it
to
him
on
a
strict
promise
to
give
it
back
henry
was
allowed
to
take
it
in
his
hands
then
he
cheered
up
somewhat
that
ai
much
he
scornfully
remarked
it
ai
runnin
at
the
same
moment
a
dazzling
idea
occurred
to
him
he
had
always
wanted
to
see
the
insides
of
a
watch
i
bet
i
fix
it
for
you
he
declared
a
few
minutes
later
when
mary
ford
looked
for
henry
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
will
was
also
missing
when
after
services
they
had
not
appeared
the
parents
became
worried
they
searched
inquiries
and
explorations
failed
to
reveal
the
boys
they
were
in
the
bennetts
farm
shop
busy
with
the
watch
having
no
small
enough
henry
made
one
by
filing
a
shingle
nail
then
he
set
to
work
and
took
out
every
screw
in
the
mechanism
the
works
came
out
of
the
case
to
the
accompaniment
of
an
agonized
protest
from
will
the
cogs
fell
apart
the
springs
unwound
altogether
it
was
a
beautiful
disorder
enough
to
delight
any
small
boy
now
look
what
you
went
and
done
cried
will
torn
between
natural
emotion
over
the
disaster
to
his
watch
and
admiration
of
henry
daring
well
you
said
you
was
goin
ta
put
it
together
he
reminded
that
experimenter
many
times
in
the
next
few
hours
dinner
time
came
and
will
recalling
the
fried
chicken
dumplings
puddings
cakes
of
the
sunday
dinner
grew
more
than
restless
but
henry
held
him
there
by
the
sheer
force
of
his
enthusiasm
the
afternoon
wore
along
and
he
was
still
investigating
those
fascinating
gears
and
springs
when
at
last
outraged
parental
authority
descended
upon
the
boys
henry
sunday
clothes
were
a
wreck
his
hands
and
face
were
grimy
but
he
had
correctly
replaced
most
of
the
screws
and
he
passionately
declared
that
if
they
would
only
leave
him
alone
he
would
have
the
watch
running
in
no
time
family
discipline
was
strict
in
those
days
undoubtedly
henry
was
punished
but
he
does
not
recall
that
now
what
he
does
remember
vividly
is
the
passion
for
investigating
clocks
and
watches
that
followed
in
a
few
months
he
had
taken
apart
and
put
together
every
timepiece
on
the
place
excepting
only
his
father
watch
every
clock
in
the
house
shuddered
when
it
saw
me
coming
he
says
but
the
knowledge
he
acquired
was
more
than
useful
to
him
later
when
at
sixteen
he
faced
the
problem
of
making
his
own
living
in
detroit
in
those
days
farm
life
had
no
great
appeal
for
him
there
were
plenty
of
chores
to
be
done
by
an
active
boy
of
on
that
farm
where
every
bit
of
energy
was
put
to
some
useful
purpose
he
drove
up
the
cows
at
night
kept
the
kitchen
filled
helped
to
hitch
and
unhitch
the
horses
learned
to
milk
and
chop
kindling
he
recalls
that
his
principal
objection
to
such
work
was
that
it
was
always
interrupting
some
interesting
occupation
he
had
discovered
for
himself
in
the
shop
he
liked
to
handle
tools
to
make
something
the
chores
were
an
endless
repetition
of
the
same
task
with
no
concrete
object
created
in
the
winter
he
went
to
the
district
school
walking
two
miles
and
back
every
day
through
the
snow
and
enjoying
it
he
did
not
care
for
school
especially
although
he
got
fair
marks
in
his
studies
and
was
given
to
helping
other
boys
get
their
problems
arithmetic
was
easy
for
him
his
mind
was
already
developing
its
mechanical
trend
i
always
stood
well
with
the
teacher
he
says
with
a
twinkle
i
found
things
ran
more
smoothly
that
way
he
was
not
the
boy
to
create
unnecessary
friction
in
his
human
relations
finding
it
as
wasteful
of
energy
there
as
it
would
have
been
in
any
of
the
mechanical
contrivances
he
made
he
got
along
pretty
well
with
every
one
until
the
time
came
to
fight
and
then
he
fought
hard
and
quick
under
his
leadership
for
he
was
popular
with
the
other
boys
the
greenfield
school
saw
strange
things
done
henry
liked
to
play
as
well
as
any
boy
but
somehow
in
his
thrifty
ancestry
there
had
been
developed
a
strong
desire
to
have
something
to
show
for
time
spent
swimming
skating
and
the
like
were
all
very
well
until
he
had
thoroughly
learned
them
but
why
keep
on
after
that
henry
wanted
to
do
something
else
then
and
as
for
spending
a
whole
afternoon
batting
a
ball
around
that
seemed
to
him
a
foolish
occupation
accordingly
he
constructed
a
working
forge
in
the
schoolyard
and
he
and
his
crowd
spent
every
recess
and
noon
during
one
autumn
working
at
it
there
with
the
aid
of
a
they
melted
every
bottle
and
bit
of
broken
glass
they
could
find
and
recast
them
into
strange
shapes
it
was
henry
too
who
devised
the
plan
of
damming
the
creek
that
ran
near
the
schoolhouse
and
by
organizing
the
other
boys
into
regular
gangs
with
a
subforeman
for
each
accomplished
the
task
so
thoroughly
and
quickly
that
he
had
flooded
two
acres
of
potatoes
before
an
outraged
farmer
knew
what
was
happening
but
these
occupations
absorbing
enough
for
the
time
being
did
not
fill
his
imagination
henry
already
dreamed
of
bigger
things
he
meant
some
day
to
be
a
locomotive
engineer
when
he
saw
the
big
black
engines
roaring
across
the
michigan
farm
lands
under
their
plumes
of
smoke
and
when
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
sooty
man
in
overalls
at
the
throttle
he
felt
an
ambitious
longing
some
day
it
was
on
the
whole
a
busy
happy
childhood
spent
for
the
most
part
out
of
doors
henry
grew
freckled
sunburned
the
skin
from
his
nose
and
neck
in
the
swimming
pool
scratched
his
bare
legs
on
blackberry
briars
he
learned
how
to
drive
horses
how
to
handle
a
hay
fork
or
a
hoe
how
to
sharpen
and
repair
the
farm
tools
the
shop
was
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
farm
to
him
it
was
there
he
invented
and
manufactured
a
device
for
opening
and
closing
the
farm
gates
without
getting
down
from
the
wagon
then
when
he
was
an
event
occurred
which
undoubtedly
changed
the
course
of
his
life
mary
ford
died
chapter
iii
the
first
job
when
mary
ford
died
the
heart
of
the
home
went
with
her
the
house
was
like
a
watch
without
a
mainspring
her
son
says
william
ford
did
his
best
but
it
must
have
been
a
pathetic
attempt
that
effort
of
the
big
hardworking
farmer
to
take
a
mother
place
to
the
four
children
for
a
time
a
married
aunt
came
in
and
managed
the
household
but
she
was
needed
in
her
own
home
and
soon
went
back
to
it
then
margaret
youngest
sister
took
charge
and
tried
to
keep
the
house
in
order
and
superintend
the
work
of
hired
girls
older
than
herself
she
was
capable
that
good
new
england
word
so
much
more
expressive
than
efficient
but
no
one
could
take
mary
ford
place
in
that
home
there
was
now
nothing
to
hold
henry
on
the
farm
he
had
learned
how
to
do
the
farm
work
and
the
little
attraction
it
had
had
for
him
was
gone
thereafter
every
task
was
merely
a
repetition
his
father
did
not
need
his
help
there
were
always
the
hired
men
i
suppose
any
need
william
ford
may
have
felt
for
the
companionship
of
his
second
son
was
unexpressed
in
matters
of
emotion
the
family
is
not
demonstrative
the
boy
had
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
the
farm
shop
his
last
work
in
it
was
the
building
of
a
small
for
this
helped
partly
by
pictures
partly
by
his
boyish
ingenuity
he
made
his
own
patterns
his
own
castings
did
his
own
machine
work
his
material
was
bits
of
old
iron
pieces
of
wagon
tires
stray
teeth
from
harrows
anything
and
everything
from
the
scrap
pile
in
the
shop
which
he
could
utilize
in
any
imaginable
way
when
the
engine
was
finished
henry
mounted
it
on
an
improvised
chassis
which
he
had
cut
down
from
an
old
farm
wagon
attached
it
by
a
direct
drive
to
a
wheel
on
one
side
something
like
a
locomotive
and
capped
the
whole
with
a
whistle
which
could
be
heard
for
miles
when
he
had
completed
the
job
he
looked
at
the
result
with
some
natural
pride
sitting
at
the
throttle
tooting
the
whistle
he
charged
up
and
down
the
meadow
lot
at
nearly
ten
miles
an
hour
frightening
every
cow
on
the
place
but
after
all
his
work
for
some
reason
the
engine
did
not
please
him
long
possibly
the
lack
of
enthusiasm
with
which
it
was
received
disappointed
him
in
the
technical
journals
which
he
read
eagerly
during
his
sixteenth
winter
he
learned
about
the
big
iron
works
of
detroit
saw
pictures
of
machines
he
longed
to
handle
early
the
next
spring
when
the
snow
had
melted
and
every
breeze
that
blew
across
the
fields
was
an
invitation
to
begin
something
new
henry
started
to
school
as
usual
one
morning
and
did
not
return
detroit
is
only
a
few
miles
from
greenfield
henry
made
the
journey
on
the
train
that
morning
and
while
his
family
supposed
him
at
school
and
the
teacher
was
marking
a
absent
after
his
name
he
had
already
set
about
his
independent
career
he
had
made
several
trips
to
detroit
in
the
past
but
this
time
the
city
looked
very
different
to
him
it
had
worn
a
holiday
appearance
before
but
now
it
seemed
stern
and
busy
a
little
too
busy
perhaps
to
waste
much
attention
on
a
country
boy
of
sixteen
looking
for
a
job
nevertheless
he
whistled
cheerfully
enough
to
himself
and
started
briskly
through
the
crowds
he
knew
what
he
wanted
and
he
was
going
straight
for
it
i
always
knew
i
would
get
what
i
went
after
he
says
i
do
recall
having
any
very
great
doubts
or
fears
at
that
time
the
shop
of
james
flower
and
company
manufacturers
of
steam
engines
and
steam
engine
appliances
was
one
of
detroit
largest
factories
over
one
hundred
men
were
employed
there
and
their
output
was
one
to
be
pointed
to
with
pride
by
boastful
citizens
henry
ford
nerves
healthy
and
steady
as
they
were
tingled
with
excitement
when
he
entered
the
place
he
had
read
of
it
and
had
even
seen
a
picture
of
it
but
now
he
beheld
for
himself
its
size
and
the
great
number
of
machines
and
men
this
was
something
big
he
said
to
himself
after
a
moment
he
asked
a
man
working
near
where
he
could
find
the
foreman
over
there
the
big
fellow
in
the
red
shirt
the
man
replied
henry
hurried
over
and
asked
for
a
job
the
foreman
looked
at
him
and
saw
a
slight
wiry
country
boy
who
wanted
work
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
him
one
supposes
the
foreman
did
not
perceive
immediately
after
one
look
into
his
steady
eye
that
this
was
no
ordinary
lad
as
foremen
so
frequently
do
in
fiction
instead
he
looked
henry
over
asked
him
a
question
or
two
remembered
that
a
big
order
had
just
come
in
and
he
was
short
of
hands
well
come
to
work
i
see
what
you
can
do
he
said
pay
you
two
and
a
half
a
week
all
right
sir
henry
responded
promptly
but
the
foreman
had
already
turned
his
back
and
forgotten
him
henry
almost
doubtful
of
his
good
fortune
hurried
away
before
the
foreman
should
change
his
mind
outside
in
the
sunshine
he
pushed
his
cap
on
the
back
of
his
head
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
jingling
the
silver
in
one
of
them
and
walked
down
the
street
whistling
the
world
looked
like
a
good
place
to
him
no
more
farming
for
henry
ford
he
was
a
machinist
now
with
a
job
in
the
james
flower
shops
before
him
there
unrolled
a
bright
future
he
was
ambitious
he
did
not
intend
always
to
remain
a
mechanic
one
day
when
he
had
learned
all
there
was
to
know
about
the
making
of
steam
engines
he
intended
to
drive
one
himself
he
would
be
a
locomotive
engineer
nothing
less
meantime
there
were
practical
questions
of
food
and
shelter
to
consider
immediately
and
he
was
not
the
boy
to
waste
time
in
speculations
for
the
future
when
there
was
anything
to
be
done
he
counted
his
money
almost
four
dollars
and
a
prospect
of
two
and
a
half
every
week
then
he
set
out
to
find
a
boarding
house
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
not
a
large
living
income
even
in
henry
walked
a
long
time
looking
for
a
landlady
who
would
consent
to
board
a
healthy
mechanic
for
that
sum
it
was
late
that
afternoon
before
he
found
one
who
after
some
hesitation
agreed
to
do
it
then
he
looked
at
the
small
dirty
room
she
showed
him
at
her
untidy
slatternly
person
and
decided
that
he
would
not
live
there
he
came
out
into
the
street
again
henry
was
facing
the
big
problem
how
was
he
to
live
on
an
income
too
small
apparently
his
mind
went
with
the
precision
of
a
machine
directly
to
the
answer
when
your
reasonable
expenses
exceed
your
income
increase
your
income
simple
he
knew
that
after
he
had
finished
his
day
work
at
the
shops
there
would
be
a
margin
of
several
hours
a
day
left
to
him
he
would
have
to
turn
them
into
money
that
was
all
he
returned
to
a
clean
boarding
house
he
had
visited
earlier
in
the
day
paid
three
dollars
and
a
half
in
advance
for
one
week
board
and
ate
a
hearty
supper
then
he
went
to
bed
chapter
iv
an
exacting
routine
meantime
back
in
greenfield
there
was
a
flurry
of
excitement
and
not
a
little
worry
henry
did
not
return
from
school
in
time
to
help
with
the
chores
when
supper
time
came
and
went
without
his
appearing
margaret
was
sure
some
terrible
accident
had
occurred
a
hired
man
was
sent
to
make
inquiries
he
returned
with
the
news
that
henry
had
not
been
in
school
then
william
ford
himself
hitched
up
and
drove
about
the
neighborhood
looking
for
the
boy
with
characteristic
reserve
and
independence
henry
had
taken
no
one
into
his
confidence
but
late
that
night
his
father
returned
with
information
that
he
had
been
seen
taking
the
train
for
detroit
william
ford
knew
his
son
when
he
found
that
henry
had
left
of
his
own
accord
he
told
margaret
dryly
that
the
boy
could
take
care
of
himself
and
there
was
nothing
to
worry
about
however
after
two
days
had
gone
by
without
any
word
from
henry
his
father
went
up
to
detroit
to
look
for
him
those
two
days
had
been
full
of
interest
for
henry
he
found
that
his
hours
in
the
machine
shop
were
from
seven
in
the
morning
to
six
at
night
with
no
idle
moments
in
any
of
them
he
helped
at
the
forges
made
castings
assembled
parts
he
was
happy
there
were
no
chores
or
school
to
interrupt
his
absorption
in
machinery
every
hour
he
learned
something
new
about
steam
engines
when
the
closing
whistle
blew
and
the
men
dropped
their
tools
he
was
sorry
to
quit
still
there
was
that
extra
dollar
a
week
to
be
made
somehow
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
supper
the
first
night
he
hurried
out
to
look
for
an
evening
job
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
work
at
anything
other
than
machinery
he
was
a
machine
fan
just
as
some
boys
are
baseball
fans
he
liked
mechanical
problems
a
batting
average
never
interested
him
but
making
things
go
there
was
real
fun
in
that
machine
shops
were
not
open
at
night
but
he
recalled
his
experiments
with
the
luckless
family
clock
he
hunted
up
a
jeweler
and
asked
him
for
night
work
then
he
hunted
up
another
and
another
none
of
them
needed
an
assistant
when
the
jewelers
shops
closed
that
night
he
went
back
to
his
he
spent
another
day
at
work
in
the
james
flower
shops
he
spent
another
night
looking
for
work
with
a
jeweler
the
third
day
late
in
the
afternoon
his
father
found
him
knowing
henry
interests
william
ford
had
begun
his
search
by
inquiring
for
the
boy
in
detroit
machine
shops
he
spoke
to
the
foreman
and
took
henry
outside
there
was
an
argument
william
ford
backed
by
the
force
of
parental
authority
declared
sternly
that
the
place
for
henry
was
in
school
henry
with
two
experience
in
a
real
iron
works
hotly
declared
that
he
never
go
back
to
school
not
if
he
was
licked
for
it
what
the
good
of
the
old
school
anyhow
i
want
to
learn
to
make
steam
engines
he
said
in
the
end
william
ford
saw
the
futility
of
argument
he
must
have
been
an
unusually
reasonable
father
for
the
time
and
place
it
would
have
been
a
simple
matter
to
lead
henry
home
by
the
ear
and
keep
him
there
until
he
ran
away
again
and
in
most
michigan
fathers
in
his
situation
would
have
done
it
well
you
know
where
your
home
is
any
time
you
want
to
come
back
to
it
he
said
finally
and
went
back
to
the
farm
henry
was
now
definitely
on
his
own
resources
with
urgent
need
for
that
extra
dollar
a
week
weighing
more
heavily
on
his
mind
every
day
he
spent
his
evenings
searching
for
night
work
before
the
time
arrived
to
pay
his
second
week
board
he
had
found
a
jeweler
who
was
willing
to
pay
him
two
dollars
a
week
for
four
hours
work
every
night
the
arrangement
left
henry
with
a
dollar
a
week
for
spending
money
this
was
embarrassing
riches
i
never
did
figure
out
how
to
spend
the
whole
of
that
dollar
he
says
i
really
had
no
use
for
it
my
board
and
lodging
were
paid
and
the
clothes
i
had
were
good
enough
for
the
shop
i
never
have
known
what
to
do
with
money
after
my
expenses
were
paid
ca
squander
it
on
myself
without
hurting
myself
and
nobody
wants
to
do
that
money
is
the
most
useless
thing
in
the
world
anyhow
his
life
now
settled
into
a
routine
eminently
satisfactory
to
him
a
routine
that
lasted
for
nine
months
from
seven
in
the
morning
to
six
at
night
in
the
machine
shop
from
seven
to
eleven
in
the
evening
at
work
with
a
microscope
repairing
and
assembling
watches
then
home
to
bed
for
a
good
six
hours
sleep
and
back
to
work
again
day
followed
day
exactly
alike
except
that
every
one
of
them
taught
him
something
about
machines
either
steam
engines
or
watches
he
went
to
bed
rose
ate
worked
on
a
regular
schedule
following
the
same
route
the
shortest
one
from
the
to
the
shops
to
the
jeweler
back
to
the
again
before
long
he
found
that
he
could
spend
a
part
of
his
dollar
profitably
in
buying
technical
journals
french
english
german
magazines
dealing
with
mechanics
he
read
these
in
his
room
after
returning
from
the
jeweler
few
boys
of
sixteen
could
endure
a
routine
so
exacting
in
its
demands
on
strength
and
endurance
without
destroying
their
health
but
henry
ford
had
the
one
trait
common
to
all
men
of
achievement
an
apparently
inexhaustible
energy
his
active
boyhood
had
stored
up
physical
reserves
of
it
his
one
direct
interest
gave
him
his
mental
supply
he
wanted
to
learn
about
machines
that
was
all
he
wanted
he
was
never
distracted
by
other
impulses
or
tastes
recreation
no
i
had
no
recreation
i
did
want
it
he
says
what
the
value
of
recreation
anyhow
it
just
waste
time
i
got
my
fun
out
of
my
work
he
was
obsessed
by
his
one
idea
in
a
few
months
he
had
mastered
all
the
intricate
details
of
building
steam
engines
the
mammoth
shop
of
james
flower
with
its
great
force
of
a
hundred
mechanics
became
familiar
to
him
it
shrank
from
the
huge
proportions
it
had
at
first
assumed
in
his
eyes
he
began
to
see
imperfections
in
its
system
and
to
be
annoyed
by
them
see
here
he
said
one
day
to
the
man
who
worked
beside
him
ever
made
twice
alike
in
this
place
we
waste
a
lot
of
time
and
material
assembling
these
engines
that
piston
rod
have
to
be
made
over
it
wo
fit
the
cylinder
oh
well
i
guess
we
do
the
best
we
can
the
other
man
said
it
take
long
to
fit
it
it
was
the
method
of
factories
in
the
seventies
men
were
shifted
from
job
to
job
to
suit
the
whim
of
the
foreman
or
the
exigencies
of
a
rush
order
parts
were
cast
recast
filed
down
to
fit
other
parts
scrap
iron
accumulated
in
the
corners
of
the
shop
a
piece
of
work
was
abandoned
half
finished
in
order
to
make
up
time
on
another
order
delayed
by
some
accident
by
standards
it
was
a
veritable
from
which
the
finished
machines
somehow
emerged
at
a
fearful
cost
in
wasted
time
and
labor
when
henry
was
switched
from
one
piece
of
work
to
another
taken
from
his
job
to
help
some
other
workman
or
sent
to
get
a
needed
tool
that
was
missing
he
knew
that
his
time
was
being
wasted
his
thrifty
instincts
resented
it
with
his
mind
full
of
pictures
of
smoothly
running
exactly
adjusted
machines
he
knew
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
way
the
was
managed
he
was
growing
dissatisfied
with
his
job
chapter
v
getting
the
machine
idea
when
henry
had
been
with
the
james
flower
company
nine
months
his
wages
were
increased
he
received
three
dollars
a
week
he
was
not
greatly
impressed
he
had
not
been
working
for
the
money
he
wanted
to
learn
more
about
machines
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
advantages
of
the
were
nearly
exhausted
he
had
had
in
turn
nearly
every
job
in
the
place
which
had
been
a
good
education
for
him
but
the
methods
which
had
allowed
it
annoyed
him
more
every
day
he
began
to
think
the
foreman
rather
a
stupid
fellow
with
slipshod
inefficient
ideas
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
shop
was
a
very
good
one
for
those
days
it
turned
out
good
machines
and
did
it
with
no
more
waste
than
was
customary
efficiency
experts
experiments
mass
production
in
a
word
the
machine
idea
applied
to
human
beings
was
unheard
of
then
henry
knew
there
was
something
wrong
he
did
not
like
to
work
there
any
longer
two
weeks
after
the
additional
fifty
cents
had
been
added
to
his
pay
envelope
he
left
the
james
flower
company
he
had
got
a
job
with
the
drydock
engine
works
manufacturers
of
marine
machinery
his
pay
was
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
week
to
the
few
men
who
knew
him
he
probably
seemed
a
discontented
boy
who
did
not
know
when
he
was
well
off
if
any
of
them
took
the
trouble
to
advise
him
they
probably
said
he
would
do
better
to
stay
with
a
good
thing
while
he
had
it
than
to
change
around
aimlessly
he
was
far
from
being
a
boy
who
needed
that
advice
without
knowing
it
he
had
found
the
one
thing
he
was
to
follow
all
his
life
not
machines
merely
but
the
machine
idea
he
went
to
work
for
the
drydock
company
because
he
liked
its
organization
by
this
time
he
was
a
little
more
than
years
old
an
active
wiry
young
man
his
muscles
hard
and
his
hands
calloused
from
work
after
nearly
a
year
of
complete
absorption
in
mechanical
problems
his
natural
liking
for
human
companionship
began
to
assert
itself
at
the
drydock
works
he
found
a
group
of
young
men
like
himself
young
mechanics
in
a
few
weeks
he
was
popular
with
them
they
were
a
clean
energetic
lot
and
ambitious
as
most
mechanics
are
after
the
day
work
was
finished
they
rushed
through
the
wide
doors
into
the
street
with
a
whoop
of
delight
in
the
outdoor
air
jostling
each
other
playing
practical
jokes
enjoying
a
little
rough
horseplay
among
themselves
in
the
evenings
they
wandered
about
the
streets
in
couples
arms
carelessly
thrown
over
each
other
shoulders
commenting
on
things
they
saw
they
learned
every
inch
of
the
water
front
tried
each
other
out
in
wrestling
and
boxing
eager
young
fellows
grasping
at
life
with
both
hands
wanting
all
of
it
and
wanting
it
right
then
naturally
enough
they
smoked
drank
experimented
with
turned
night
into
day
in
a
joyous
carouse
now
and
then
but
before
long
henry
ford
was
a
leader
among
them
as
he
had
been
among
the
boys
in
the
greenfield
school
and
again
he
diverted
the
energy
of
his
followers
into
his
own
channels
pursuits
that
had
interested
them
seemed
to
him
a
waste
of
time
and
strength
he
did
not
smoke
his
tentative
attempt
with
in
his
boyhood
had
discouraged
that
permanently
he
did
not
drink
and
girls
seemed
to
him
unutterably
stupid
i
have
never
tasted
liquor
in
my
life
he
says
i
as
soon
think
of
taking
any
other
poison
undoubtedly
his
opinion
is
right
but
one
is
inclined
to
doubt
the
accuracy
of
his
memory
in
those
early
days
in
detroit
he
must
have
experimented
at
least
once
with
the
effects
of
liquor
on
the
human
system
probably
once
would
have
been
sufficient
besides
about
that
time
he
developed
an
interest
so
strong
that
it
not
only
absorbed
his
own
attention
but
carried
that
of
his
friends
along
with
it
he
bought
a
watch
it
had
taken
him
only
a
few
months
to
master
his
task
in
the
drydock
works
so
thoroughly
that
his
wages
were
raised
later
they
were
raised
again
then
he
was
getting
five
dollars
a
week
more
than
enough
to
pay
his
expenses
without
night
work
he
left
the
jeweler
shop
but
he
brought
with
him
a
watch
the
first
he
had
ever
owned
immediately
he
took
it
to
pieces
when
its
scattered
parts
lay
on
a
table
before
him
he
looked
at
them
and
marveled
he
had
paid
three
dollars
for
the
watch
and
he
could
not
figure
out
any
reason
why
it
should
have
cost
so
much
it
ran
he
says
it
had
some
kind
of
a
dark
composition
case
and
it
weighed
a
good
deal
and
it
went
along
all
right
never
lost
or
gained
more
than
a
certain
amount
in
any
given
day
but
there
was
anything
about
that
watch
that
should
have
cost
three
dollars
nothing
but
a
lot
of
plain
parts
made
out
of
cheap
metal
i
could
have
made
one
like
it
for
one
dollar
or
even
less
but
it
cost
me
three
the
only
way
i
could
figure
it
out
was
that
there
was
a
lot
of
waste
somewhere
then
he
remembered
the
methods
of
production
at
the
james
flower
company
he
reasoned
that
probably
that
watch
factory
had
turned
out
only
a
few
hundred
of
that
design
and
then
tried
something
else
alarm
clocks
perhaps
the
parts
had
been
made
by
the
dozen
some
of
them
had
probably
been
filed
down
by
hand
to
make
them
fit
then
he
got
the
great
idea
a
factory
a
gigantic
factory
running
with
the
precision
of
a
machine
turning
out
watches
by
the
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
watches
all
exactly
alike
every
part
cut
by
an
exact
die
he
talked
it
over
with
the
boys
at
the
drydock
works
he
was
enthusiastic
he
showed
them
that
a
watch
could
be
made
for
less
than
half
a
dollar
by
his
plan
he
juggled
figures
of
thousands
of
dollars
as
though
they
were
pennies
the
size
of
the
sums
did
not
stagger
him
because
money
was
never
concrete
to
him
it
was
merely
rows
of
figures
but
to
the
young
fellows
who
listened
his
talk
was
dazzling
they
joined
enthusiastically
in
the
scheme
then
their
evenings
became
merely
so
much
time
to
spend
up
in
ford
room
figuring
estimates
and
discussing
plans
the
watch
could
be
made
for
cents
provided
machinery
turned
it
out
by
tens
of
thousands
henry
ford
visualized
the
factory
a
factory
devoted
to
one
thing
the
making
of
one
watch
specialized
concentrated
with
no
waste
energy
those
eager
young
men
planned
the
whole
thing
from
furnaces
to
assembling
rooms
they
figured
the
cost
of
material
by
the
hundred
tons
estimated
the
exact
proportions
each
metal
required
they
planned
an
output
of
watches
daily
as
the
point
at
which
cost
of
production
would
be
cheapest
they
would
sell
the
watch
for
fifty
cents
and
guarantee
it
for
one
year
two
thousand
watches
at
a
profit
of
thirteen
cents
each
daily
profit
they
were
dazzled
we
need
stop
there
we
can
increase
that
output
when
we
get
started
henry
ford
declared
organization
will
do
it
lack
of
organization
keeps
prices
up
for
its
cost
must
be
charged
in
on
the
selling
price
and
high
prices
keep
sales
down
we
will
work
it
the
other
way
low
prices
increased
sales
increased
output
lower
prices
it
works
in
a
circle
listen
to
this
he
held
them
listening
while
he
talked
and
figured
eliminating
waste
here
and
cutting
expenses
there
until
the
landlady
came
up
and
knocked
at
the
door
asking
if
they
meant
to
stay
up
all
night
it
took
time
to
get
his
ideas
translated
into
concrete
exact
figures
he
worked
over
them
for
nearly
a
year
holding
the
enthusiasm
of
his
friends
at
fever
heat
all
that
time
finally
he
made
drawings
for
the
machines
he
planned
and
cut
dies
for
making
the
different
parts
of
the
watch
his
plan
was
complete
a
gigantic
machine
taking
in
bars
of
steel
at
one
end
and
turning
out
completed
watches
at
the
other
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cheap
watches
all
alike
the
ford
watch
i
tell
you
there
a
fortune
in
it
a
fortune
the
young
fellows
in
the
scheme
exclaimed
to
each
other
all
we
need
now
is
the
capital
ford
decided
at
last
he
was
turning
his
mind
to
the
problem
of
getting
it
when
he
received
a
letter
from
his
sister
margaret
his
father
had
been
injured
in
an
accident
his
older
brother
was
could
he
come
home
for
a
while
they
needed
him
chapter
vi
back
to
the
farm
the
letter
from
home
must
have
come
like
a
dash
of
cold
water
on
enthusiastic
plans
he
had
been
thinking
in
the
future
planning
rearranging
adjusting
the
years
just
ahead
it
has
always
been
his
instinct
to
do
just
that
you
ca
run
anything
on
precedents
if
you
want
to
make
a
success
he
says
we
should
be
guiding
our
future
by
the
present
instead
of
being
guided
in
the
present
by
the
past
suddenly
the
past
had
come
into
his
calculations
henry
spent
a
dark
day
or
two
over
that
letter
the
universal
struggle
between
the
claims
of
the
older
generation
and
the
desires
of
the
younger
one
there
was
never
any
real
question
as
to
the
outcome
the
has
been
the
controlling
factor
in
his
life
but
it
has
never
been
stronger
than
his
human
sympathies
it
is
in
adjusting
them
to
each
other
in
making
human
sympathies
a
working
business
policy
that
he
has
made
his
real
success
of
course
at
that
time
he
did
not
see
such
a
possibility
it
was
a
struggle
between
two
opposing
forces
on
one
side
the
splendid
future
just
ahead
on
the
other
his
father
need
of
him
he
went
home
he
intended
at
the
time
to
stay
only
until
his
father
was
well
again
perhaps
for
a
month
or
so
surely
not
longer
than
one
summer
the
plans
for
the
watch
factory
were
not
abandoned
they
were
only
laid
aside
temporarily
it
would
be
possible
to
run
up
to
detroit
for
a
day
or
two
now
and
then
and
keep
on
working
on
plans
for
getting
together
the
necessary
capital
but
no
business
on
earth
is
harder
to
leave
than
the
business
of
running
a
farm
when
henry
reached
home
he
found
a
dozen
fields
needing
immediate
action
the
corn
had
been
neglected
already
weeds
were
springing
up
between
the
rows
in
the
house
his
father
was
fretting
because
the
hired
hands
were
not
feeding
the
cows
properly
and
they
were
giving
less
milk
the
clover
was
going
to
seed
while
the
hogs
looked
hungrily
at
it
through
the
fence
because
there
was
no
one
to
see
that
their
noses
were
ringed
and
the
gates
opened
some
of
the
plows
and
harrows
had
been
left
in
the
fields
where
they
were
rusting
in
the
summer
sun
and
rain
there
was
plenty
of
work
for
henry
at
first
from
day
to
day
then
from
week
to
week
he
put
off
the
trip
to
detroit
he
worked
in
the
fields
with
the
men
plowing
planting
harvesting
setting
the
pace
for
the
others
to
follow
as
an
owner
must
do
on
a
farm
he
was
learning
so
thoroughly
that
he
never
forgot
it
the
art
of
managing
men
without
losing
the
democratic
feeling
of
being
one
of
them
in
the
mornings
he
was
up
before
daylight
and
out
to
the
he
fed
the
horses
watched
that
the
milking
was
thoroughly
done
and
gave
orders
for
the
day
work
then
the
great
bell
clanged
once
and
he
and
all
the
men
hurried
into
the
house
where
sitting
at
one
long
table
in
the
kitchen
they
ate
the
breakfast
margaret
and
the
hired
girls
brought
to
them
piping
hot
from
the
stove
after
that
they
scattered
driving
down
the
farm
lanes
to
the
fields
while
the
sun
rose
and
the
meadows
sparkling
with
dew
scented
the
air
with
clover
the
sun
rose
higher
pouring
its
heat
down
upon
them
as
they
worked
and
a
shrill
whirring
noise
rose
from
all
the
tiny
insects
in
the
grass
a
note
like
the
voice
of
the
heat
coats
and
vests
came
off
and
were
tossed
in
the
fence
corners
sleeves
were
rolled
up
shirts
opened
wide
at
the
neck
whew
it
hot
said
henry
stopping
to
wipe
the
sweat
from
his
face
where
the
water
jug
jim
what
say
you
run
and
bring
it
up
have
a
drink
before
we
go
on
so
they
worked
through
the
mornings
stopping
gladly
enough
when
the
great
bell
clanged
out
the
welcome
news
that
margaret
and
the
girls
had
prepared
the
huge
dinner
their
appetites
demanded
in
the
afternoons
henry
on
the
little
gray
mare
rode
to
the
far
fields
for
a
diplomatic
authoritative
word
with
the
men
plowing
there
or
perhaps
he
went
a
little
farther
and
bargained
with
the
next
neighbor
for
a
likely
looking
yearling
heifer
then
back
at
night
to
the
big
where
the
cows
must
be
milked
the
horses
watered
fed
and
everything
made
comfortable
and
safe
for
the
night
it
was
a
very
different
life
from
that
in
the
machine
shop
and
henry
ford
thought
when
he
pored
over
his
mechanic
journals
by
the
lamp
in
the
evenings
that
he
was
wasting
precious
time
but
he
was
learning
a
great
many
things
he
would
find
useful
later
margaret
ford
was
by
this
time
a
healthy
attractive
young
woman
with
all
the
affairs
of
the
household
and
dairy
well
in
hand
the
social
affairs
of
the
community
began
to
center
around
her
in
the
evenings
the
young
men
of
the
neighborhood
rode
over
to
propose
picnics
and
after
church
on
sundays
a
dozen
young
people
would
come
trooping
out
to
the
farm
with
her
and
margaret
would
put
a
white
apron
over
her
best
dress
and
serve
a
big
country
dinner
they
had
a
rollicking
time
in
the
grassy
front
yards
afterwards
or
out
in
the
orchard
when
the
plums
were
ripe
late
in
the
afternoon
they
separated
somehow
into
pairs
as
young
people
will
do
and
walked
the
three
miles
to
church
for
the
evening
services
it
may
be
imagined
that
the
girls
of
the
neighborhood
were
interested
when
henry
appeared
in
church
again
now
a
young
man
of
back
from
the
city
the
social
popularity
of
the
ford
place
must
have
increased
considerably
on
this
point
ford
is
discreetly
silent
but
it
does
not
require
any
great
effort
of
fancy
to
see
him
as
he
must
have
looked
then
through
the
eyes
of
the
greenfield
girls
an
alert
muscular
fellow
with
a
droll
humor
and
a
whimsical
smile
moreover
the
driver
of
the
finest
horses
in
the
neighborhood
and
one
of
the
heirs
to
the
big
farm
however
he
is
outspoken
enough
about
his
own
attitude
he
did
not
care
for
girls
like
most
men
with
a
real
interest
he
kept
for
a
long
time
the
small
boy
opinion
of
them
girls
huh
what
are
they
good
for
he
was
interested
in
machines
he
wanted
to
get
back
to
detroit
where
he
could
take
up
again
his
plans
for
that
mammoth
watch
factory
in
a
few
weeks
he
had
brought
the
farm
up
to
its
former
running
order
the
crops
were
doing
well
and
the
hired
men
had
learned
that
there
was
a
boss
at
the
head
of
affairs
henry
had
a
little
more
time
to
spend
in
the
shop
he
found
in
one
corner
of
it
the
absurd
steam
engine
he
had
built
five
years
before
and
one
day
he
started
it
up
and
ran
it
around
the
yard
it
was
a
affair
the
high
wagon
wheels
warped
and
wobbly
the
hybrid
engine
on
top
sputtering
and
wheezing
and
rattling
but
none
the
less
running
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
sparks
he
had
a
hearty
laugh
at
it
and
abandoned
it
his
father
grew
better
slowly
but
week
by
week
henry
was
approaching
the
time
when
he
could
return
to
the
work
he
liked
late
summer
came
with
all
the
work
of
getting
in
the
crops
the
harvest
crew
arrived
from
the
next
farm
twenty
men
of
them
and
henry
was
busy
in
the
fields
from
morning
to
night
when
late
in
october
the
last
work
of
the
summer
was
done
and
the
fields
lay
bare
and
brown
waiting
for
the
snow
margaret
ford
gave
a
great
harvest
supper
with
a
quilting
bee
in
the
afternoon
and
corn
husking
in
the
evening
all
the
neighbors
came
from
miles
around
the
big
barns
were
crowded
with
their
horses
and
rows
of
them
were
tied
under
the
sheds
in
the
house
the
quilting
frames
were
spread
in
the
big
attic
and
all
afternoon
the
women
sewed
and
talked
in
the
evening
the
men
arrived
and
then
the
long
supper
table
was
spread
with
margaret
cooking
hams
sausages
fried
chickens
a
whole
roast
pig
pans
of
beans
and
succotash
huge
loaves
of
bread
pats
of
butter
cheese
cakes
pies
puddings
doughnuts
pitchers
of
milk
and
cider
good
things
which
disappeared
fast
enough
before
the
plying
knives
and
forks
in
bursts
of
laughter
while
jokes
were
called
from
end
to
end
of
the
table
and
young
couples
blushed
under
the
chaffing
of
their
neighbors
clara
bryant
was
one
of
the
guests
her
father
was
a
prosperous
farmer
who
lived
eight
miles
from
the
ford
place
and
henry
had
scarcely
seen
her
that
summer
that
night
they
sat
side
by
side
and
he
noticed
the
red
in
her
cheeks
and
the
way
she
laughed
after
supper
there
was
corn
husking
in
the
big
barn
where
each
young
man
tried
to
find
the
red
ears
that
gave
him
permission
to
kiss
one
of
the
girls
and
still
later
they
danced
on
the
floor
of
the
while
the
fiddler
called
the
figures
of
the
old
square
dances
and
the
lanterns
cast
a
flickering
light
on
the
dusty
mounds
of
hay
the
next
week
henry
might
have
returned
to
detroit
and
to
the
waiting
project
of
the
watch
factory
but
he
did
not
he
thought
of
clara
bryant
and
realized
that
his
prejudice
against
girls
was
unreasonable
chapter
vii
the
road
to
hymen
with
william
ford
complete
recovery
and
the
coming
of
the
long
winter
of
the
country
there
was
no
apparent
reason
why
henry
ford
should
not
return
to
his
work
in
the
machine
shops
the
plans
for
the
watch
factory
never
wholly
abandoned
might
be
carried
out
but
henry
stayed
at
home
on
the
farm
gradually
it
became
apparent
to
the
neighborhood
that
ford
boy
had
got
over
his
liking
for
city
life
farmers
remarked
to
each
other
while
they
sat
in
their
granaries
husking
corn
that
henry
had
come
to
his
senses
and
knew
when
he
was
well
off
he
have
his
share
in
as
good
a
farm
as
any
man
could
want
some
day
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
get
out
and
hustle
in
detroit
probably
there
were
moments
when
henry
himself
shared
the
prevailing
opinion
his
interest
in
mechanics
was
as
great
as
ever
but
there
was
clara
bryant
he
made
a
few
trips
to
detroit
with
an
intention
which
seemed
to
him
earnest
enough
to
revive
the
plans
for
the
watch
factory
but
the
thought
of
her
was
always
tugging
at
his
mind
urging
him
to
come
back
to
greenfield
his
efforts
came
to
nothing
and
he
soon
lost
interest
in
them
he
was
in
his
early
twenties
then
his
ambition
had
not
yet
centered
about
a
definite
purpose
and
already
it
had
met
the
worst
enemy
of
ambition
love
it
was
a
choice
between
his
work
and
the
girl
the
girl
won
and
ten
million
ford
watches
were
lost
to
the
world
i
decided
not
to
go
back
to
detroit
henry
announced
to
the
family
at
breakfast
one
day
i
thought
you
come
around
to
seeing
it
that
way
his
father
said
you
can
do
better
here
in
the
long
run
than
you
can
in
the
city
if
you
want
to
take
care
of
the
stock
i
let
one
of
the
men
go
and
pay
you
his
wages
this
winter
all
right
henry
said
his
work
as
a
machinist
seemed
to
all
of
them
only
an
episode
now
definitely
ended
he
settled
into
the
work
of
the
farm
as
though
he
had
never
left
it
rising
in
the
cold
mornings
while
the
window
panes
showed
only
a
square
of
darkness
sparkling
with
frost
crystals
he
built
up
the
kitchen
fire
for
margaret
then
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
and
milk
pails
clanking
on
his
arm
plowed
his
way
through
the
snow
to
the
barns
a
red
streak
was
showing
in
the
eastern
horizon
buildings
and
fences
covered
with
snow
showed
odd
shapes
in
the
gray
dawn
his
breath
hung
like
smoke
on
the
frosty
air
inside
the
barns
the
animals
stirred
a
horse
stamped
a
cow
rose
lumberingly
old
rover
barked
when
he
heard
henry
hand
on
the
door
fastening
henry
hung
his
lantern
on
a
nail
and
set
to
work
he
pitched
down
hay
and
huge
forksful
of
straw
he
measured
out
rations
of
bran
and
corn
and
oats
he
milked
the
cows
stopping
before
he
carried
the
brimming
pails
to
the
house
to
pour
out
some
of
the
warm
sweet
smelling
milk
for
rover
and
the
cats
back
in
the
kitchen
margaret
had
set
the
table
for
breakfast
she
was
standing
at
the
stove
frying
sausages
and
turning
corn
cakes
the
other
boys
came
tramping
in
from
poultry
yards
and
hog
pens
they
took
turns
at
the
tin
washbasin
set
on
a
bench
on
the
back
porch
and
then
in
to
breakfast
with
hearty
appetites
afterward
they
husked
corn
in
the
big
granaries
or
shelled
it
ready
to
take
to
mill
they
cleaned
the
barn
stalls
whitewashed
the
hen
houses
sorted
the
apples
in
the
cellar
in
the
shop
henry
worked
at
the
farm
tools
sharpening
the
plows
refitting
the
harrows
with
teeth
oiling
and
cleaning
the
mowing
machines
after
supper
when
he
had
finished
the
day
work
milked
the
cows
again
filled
the
racks
in
the
calves
yard
with
hay
spread
deep
beds
of
straw
for
the
horses
seen
that
everything
was
snug
and
comfortable
about
the
big
barns
he
saddled
the
little
bay
and
rode
six
miles
to
the
bryant
farm
it
was
a
courtship
which
did
not
run
any
too
smoothly
henry
was
not
the
only
greenfield
farmer
son
who
admired
clara
bryant
and
she
was
minded
to
divide
her
favor
evenly
among
them
until
some
indefinite
time
in
the
future
when
as
she
said
she
would
see
often
enough
henry
found
another
horse
tied
to
the
hitching
post
and
another
young
man
inside
the
house
making
himself
agreeable
to
clara
then
welcomed
heartily
enough
by
her
big
jovial
father
he
would
spend
the
evening
talking
politics
with
him
while
clara
and
his
rival
popped
corn
or
roasted
apples
on
the
hearth
but
henry
built
that
winter
a
light
sleigh
painted
red
balanced
on
cushiony
springs
slipping
over
the
snow
on
smooth
steel
runners
no
girl
in
greenfield
could
have
resisted
the
offer
of
a
ride
in
it
in
the
evenings
when
the
moon
was
full
clara
and
henry
warmly
wrapped
in
fur
robes
flashed
down
the
snowy
roads
in
a
chime
of
sleighbells
the
fields
sparkled
white
on
either
hand
here
and
there
lights
gleamed
from
farm
houses
then
the
sleigh
slipped
into
the
woods
still
and
dark
except
where
the
topmost
branches
shone
silver
in
the
moonlight
and
the
road
stretched
ahead
like
a
path
of
white
velvet
their
passing
made
no
sound
on
the
soft
snow
there
were
skating
parties
too
where
henry
and
clara
mittened
hand
in
hand
swept
over
the
ice
in
long
smooth
flight
their
skates
ringing
or
it
happened
that
henry
stood
warming
his
hands
at
the
bank
and
watched
clara
skating
away
with
some
one
else
and
thought
bitter
things
somewhere
between
farm
work
and
courtship
he
found
time
to
keep
up
with
his
mechanics
trade
journals
for
his
interest
in
machinery
was
still
strong
but
he
planned
nothing
new
at
this
time
all
his
constructive
imagination
was
diverted
into
another
channel
more
than
the
loss
of
the
ford
watches
is
chargeable
to
that
laughing
rosy
country
girl
who
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
choose
between
her
suitors
the
winter
passed
and
henry
torn
between
two
interests
had
accomplished
little
with
either
spring
and
the
spring
work
came
plowing
harrowing
sowing
planting
from
long
before
dawn
until
the
deepening
twilight
hid
the
fields
henry
was
hard
at
work
until
the
pressure
of
farm
work
was
over
he
could
see
clara
only
on
sundays
then
summer
arrived
with
picnics
and
the
old
custom
of
bringing
a
crowd
of
young
people
out
from
church
for
sunday
dinner
at
the
fords
now
and
then
there
were
excursions
up
to
detroit
for
an
outing
on
the
lake
by
the
end
of
that
summer
it
was
generally
accepted
among
the
greenfield
young
folks
that
henry
ford
was
going
with
clara
bryant
but
she
must
still
have
been
elusive
for
another
winter
passed
with
nothing
definitely
decided
the
third
spring
of
henry
stay
on
the
farm
arrived
henry
went
over
his
bank
account
a
respectable
sum
made
up
of
his
earnings
on
the
farm
and
a
few
ventures
in
cattle
buying
and
selling
well
father
he
said
one
day
i
guess
i
be
getting
married
all
right
his
father
said
she
a
good
capable
girl
i
guess
give
you
that
south
forty
and
you
can
have
lumber
enough
from
the
timber
lot
to
build
a
house
when
you
get
ready
apparently
henry
had
made
up
his
mind
to
settle
the
matter
no
doubt
behind
the
ardor
he
showed
clara
there
was
an
unconscious
feeling
that
he
had
spent
enough
time
in
courtship
he
was
impatient
to
get
back
to
his
other
interests
to
have
again
an
orderly
smooth
routine
of
life
with
margins
of
time
for
machinery
in
april
he
and
clara
went
up
to
detroit
and
were
married
a
couple
of
weeks
later
they
returned
to
greenfield
clara
with
plans
for
the
new
house
on
the
south
forty
already
sketched
in
a
tablet
in
her
suitcase
henry
with
a
bundle
of
mechanics
trade
journals
and
the
responsibility
of
caring
for
a
wife
a
wife
helps
a

chapter
viii
making
a
farm
efficient
the
young
couple
went
first
to
the
fords
place
where
the
big
roomy
house
easily
spared
rooms
for
them
and
margaret
and
her
father
gave
them
a
hearty
welcome
clara
having
brought
her
belongings
from
her
old
home
put
on
her
big
and
helped
margaret
in
the
kitchen
and
dairy
henry
was
out
in
the
fields
early
working
hard
to
get
the
crops
planted
driving
the
plowshare
deep
into
the
rich
black
loam
holding
it
steady
while
the
furrow
rolled
back
under
his
feet
he
whistled
to
himself
he
was
contented
the
farm
work
was
well
in
hand
his
forty
would
bring
in
an
ample
income
from
the
first
year
in
the
house
his
rosy
little
wife
was
busy
making
the
best
butter
in
the
whole
neighborhood
he
revolved
in
his
mind
vague
plans
for
making
a
better
plow
than
the
one
he
was
handling
he
remembered
noticing
in
his
latest
english
magazine
an
article
covering
the
very
principle
he
would
use
in
the
evening
after
the
last
of
the
chores
was
done
he
settled
himself
at
the
table
in
the
moved
the
big
lamp
nearer
and
opened
the
magazine
but
clara
was
busy
correcting
the
plans
for
the
new
house
she
must
have
the
lamp
light
too
henry
moved
the
lamp
back
would
you
have
the
kitchen
here
or
here
this
way
i
could
have
windows
on
three
sides
but
the
other
way
i
have
a
larger
pantry
said
clara
stopping
to
chew
her
pencil
fix
it
exactly
to
suit
yourself
it
your
house
and
i
build
it
just
as
you
say
henry
replied
turning
a
page
but
i
want
your
advice
and
i
ca
see
how
to
get
this
back
porch
in
without
making
the
bedrooms
too
small
clara
complained
i
want
this
house
just
so
and
if
i
put
the
chimney
where
i
want
it
to
come
in
the
kitchen
it
will
be
in
the
wrong
end
of
the
best
i
can
do
oh
let
those
horrid
papers
alone
and
help
me
out
henry
let
the
horrid
papers
alone
and
bent
his
head
over
the
problems
of
porch
and
pantry
and
fireplace
when
the
pressure
of
spring
work
was
over
he
set
to
work
a
gang
of
men
cutting
down
selected
trees
in
the
timber
lot
and
hauling
them
down
to
the
little
sawmill
which
belonged
to
his
father
there
he
sawed
them
into
boards
of
the
lengths
and
sizes
he
needed
and
stocked
them
in
neat
piles
to
season
and
dry
from
the
shorter
pieces
of
timber
he
split
shakes
or
homemade
shingles
and
stacked
them
fashion
he
was
preparing
to
build
his
first
house
it
rose
little
by
little
through
that
summer
henry
built
it
himself
helped
by
one
of
the
hired
men
it
was
a
good
substantial
home
feet
and
containing
seven
rooms
and
a
roomy
attic
in
the
evenings
after
supper
dishwashing
and
the
chores
at
the
barn
were
finished
he
and
clara
strolled
over
in
the
twilight
to
inspect
the
day
progress
they
climbed
together
over
the
loose
boards
which
made
temporary
floors
looked
at
the
skeleton
partitions
of
studding
planned
where
the
stoves
should
be
set
and
what
kind
of
paper
should
be
chosen
for
the
walls
then
they
walked
around
the
outside
imagined
with
pride
how
well
the
house
would
look
when
the
siding
was
on
and
painted
white
and
planned
where
the
flower
beds
should
be
in
the
front
yard
let
be
getting
on
back
said
henry
i
saw
an
article
in
that
french
magazine
that
came
about
a
frenchman
who
invented
some
kind
of
a
carriage
that
runs
by
itself
without
horses
sort
of
a
steam
engine
to
pull
it
did
you
said
clara
how
interesting
oh
look
the
moon
coming
up
they
loitered
back
through
the
clover
fields
sweet
smelling
in
the
dew
climbed
over
the
stile
into
the
apple
orchard
where
the
leaves
were
silver
and
black
in
the
moonlight
and
so
came
slowly
home
margaret
had
cut
a
watermelon
cooled
in
a
basket
in
the
well
and
all
the
family
sat
on
the
back
porch
eating
it
long
after
midnight
when
every
one
else
was
sound
asleep
the
lamp
was
burning
in
the
and
henry
was
reading
that
article
about
the
horseless
carriage
the
idea
fascinated
him
the
new
house
was
finished
late
in
the
fall
clara
had
made
a
trip
to
detroit
to
purchase
furniture
and
all
summer
she
had
been
working
on
patchwork
quilts
and
crocheted
tidies
when
everything
was
ready
the
bright
with
new
carpet
and
shining
varnished
furniture
the
new
range
installed
in
the
kitchen
the
cellar
stocked
with
apples
vegetables
canned
fruits
henry
and
clara
moved
into
their
own
home
they
were
proud
of
it
it
a
fine
place
yet
as
good
as
anybody
could
want
henry
ford
says
now
we
still
have
it
and
we
like
to
go
down
there
in
the
summers
and
stay
awhile
all
the
furniture
is
there
exactly
as
it
was
then
i
would
ask
any
better
place
to
live
it
must
have
been
a
happy
time
for
both
of
them
they
had
a
comfortable
home
plenty
to
eat
and
wear
they
were
surrounded
by
friends
there
was
a
simple
neighborly
spirit
a
true
democracy
in
that
little
country
community
there
were
no
very
poor
families
there
no
very
rich
ones
every
one
had
plenty
and
wanted
no
more
henry
hired
men
ate
at
the
table
with
him
slept
under
the
same
roof
called
him
hen
as
a
matter
of
course
just
as
he
called
them
hi
and
dave
they
worked
together
to
plant
care
for
and
harvest
the
crops
their
interests
were
the
same
and
if
at
the
end
of
the
year
henry
had
a
more
improved
farm
to
show
for
the
year
work
it
was
the
only
difference
between
them
he
had
lived
no
better
spent
no
more
than
the
others
it
was
in
those
years
that
he
laid
the
foundation
for
his
philosophy
of
life
he
found
that
the
work
of
the
farm
progressed
faster
and
produced
more
when
every
one
worked
together
with
a
good
will
each
doing
his
own
share
and
doing
it
well
he
found
that
men
like
horses
did
their
best
when
they
were
well
fed
contented
and
not
overworked
he
saw
that
one
unruly
horse
or
one
surly
lazy
man
delayed
the
work
of
the
whole
farm
hindered
all
the
others
the
only
plan
that
will
work
out
well
in
the
long
run
is
a
plan
that
is
best
for
every
one
concerned
he
decided
hurting
the
other
fellow
is
bound
to
hurt
me
sooner
or
later
he
was
a
good
farmer
his
mechanical
orderly
mind
arranged
the
work
so
that
it
was
done
smoothly
and
on
time
without
overworking
any
one
or
leaving
any
one
idle
his
thrifty
instincts
saved
labor
and
time
just
as
they
saved
the
barn
manure
to
spread
on
the
fields
or
planned
for
the
turning
in
of
the
last
crop
of
clover
to
enrich
the
soil
his
granaries
were
well
filled
in
the
fall
his
stock
was
sleek
and
fat
fetching
top
prices
clara
kept
the
house
running
smoothly
the
pantry
filled
with
good
simple
food
the
cellar
shelves
stocked
with
preserves
and
jams
for
winter
in
the
evenings
henry
got
out
his
mechanics
journals
and
pored
over
them
while
clara
sewed
or
mended
he
found
now
and
then
a
mention
of
the
horseless
carriage
that
looks
to
me
like
a
good
idea
if
i
was
in
detroit
now
where
i
could
get
a
good
machine
shop
i
believe
i
could
do
something
along
that
line
myself
he
said
probably
you
could
his
wife
replied
rocking
comfortably
but
the
use
we
got
everything
here
we
need
yes
but
i
just
like
to
try
what
i
could
do
henry
said
restlessly
a
few
days
later
he
inspected
his
farm
shop
and
announced
that
he
was
going
up
to
detroit
for
a
day
to
get
some
materials
chapter
ix
the
lure
of
the
machine
shops
it
was
an
unconscious
subterfuge
that
statement
of
henry
ford
that
he
was
going
up
to
detroit
to
get
material
he
knew
what
he
wanted
sitting
by
the
table
in
his
own
dining
and
sitting
room
some
evening
after
clara
had
cleared
away
the
supper
dishes
he
could
have
written
out
his
order
article
by
article
exactly
what
he
needed
and
two
days
later
it
would
have
arrived
by
express
but
henry
wanted
to
get
back
to
detroit
he
was
tired
of
the
farm
those
years
of
quiet
comfortable
country
living
among
his
greenfield
neighbors
were
almost
finished
they
had
given
him
his
viewpoint
on
human
relations
they
had
saved
his
character
in
the
formative
period
from
the
distorting
pressure
of
the
struggle
of
man
against
man
in
the
city
they
had
been
from
the
standpoint
of
henry
ford
the
man
perhaps
the
most
valuable
years
in
his
life
at
that
time
he
saw
in
them
only
an
endless
repetition
of
tasks
which
had
no
great
appeal
for
him
a
recurring
cycle
of
sowing
tilling
harvesting
he
thought
he
was
accomplishing
nothing
a
little
more
money
in
the
bank
a
few
more
acres
added
to
the
farm
that
was
all
and
it
did
not
interest
him
money
never
did
his
passion
was
machinery
so
he
gave
his
orders
to
the
hired
man
pocketed
a
list
of
things
to
buy
for
clara
and
caught
the
early
train
to
detroit
that
morning
with
a
feeling
of
keen
anticipation
he
meant
to
spend
one
whole
day
in
machine
shops
from
the
station
in
detroit
he
hurried
direct
to
the
james
flower
iron
works
the
broad
busy
streets
jammed
with
carriages
and
drays
the
crowds
of
hurrying
people
did
not
hold
his
attention
for
a
moment
but
when
he
came
into
the
noisy
dirty
turmoil
of
the
machine
shop
he
was
in
his
element
again
he
took
in
a
dozen
details
at
a
glance
scarcely
a
change
had
been
made
since
he
had
first
seen
the
place
years
before
when
he
was
a
boy
of
sixteen
looking
for
a
job
the
old
foreman
was
gone
and
one
of
the
men
who
had
worked
beside
henry
in
those
days
was
in
charge
well
hello
there
ford
he
said
heartily
what
you
doing
these
days
not
looking
for
a
job
are
you
no
i
farming
now
ford
replied
just
thought
i
drop
in
and
have
a
look
around
together
they
wandered
over
the
works
and
the
foreman
shouting
to
make
himself
heard
in
the
clanging
pounding
uproar
pointed
out
here
and
there
a
new
device
an
improved
valve
a
different
gearing
ford
saw
it
all
with
interest
he
was
wider
awake
more
alive
than
he
had
been
for
months
when
he
was
leaving
the
shop
some
time
later
he
had
a
sudden
expansive
impulse
which
broke
through
his
customary
reticence
i
thinking
of
building
an
engine
myself
he
said
a
little
one
to
use
on
the
farm
i
figure
i
can
work
something
out
that
will
take
the
place
of
some
of
my
horses
the
foreman
looked
at
ford
in
amazement
it
is
hard
to
realize
now
how
astounding
such
an
idea
must
have
seemed
to
him
here
was
a
man
who
proposed
to
take
a
locomotive
into
his
cornfield
and
set
it
to
plowing
the
wild
impossibility
of
the
plan
would
have
staggered
any
reasonable
person
the
foreman
decided
that
this
was
one
of
ford
quiet
jokes
he
laughed
appreciatively
great
idea
he
applauded
all
you
need
then
be
a
machine
to
give
milk
and
you
have
the
farm
complete
well
come
around
any
time
glad
to
see
you
ford
made
the
rounds
of
detroit
machine
shops
that
day
but
he
did
not
mention
his
idea
again
it
was
gradually
shaping
itself
in
his
mind
in
part
a
revival
of
his
boyish
plan
for
that
first
steam
engine
he
had
built
of
scraps
from
his
father
shop
in
part
adapted
from
the
article
he
had
read
about
the
horseless
carriage
he
was
obliged
to
keep
enough
horses
to
handle
the
work
of
the
farm
when
it
was
heaviest
in
the
slack
season
and
during
the
winter
the
extra
animals
were
necessarily
idle
wasting
food
and
barn
space
and
waste
of
any
kind
was
an
irritation
to
his
methodical
mind
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
machine
could
be
built
which
would
do
a
great
part
of
the
horses
work
in
the
fields
and
cost
nothing
while
not
in
use
that
the
undertaking
was
revolutionary
visionary
probably
ridiculous
to
other
people
did
not
deter
him
he
thought
he
could
do
it
and
that
was
enough
precedents
and
prejudice
are
the
worst
things
in
this
world
he
says
every
generation
has
its
own
problem
it
ought
to
find
its
own
solutions
there
is
no
use
in
our
living
if
we
ca
do
things
better
than
our
fathers
did
that
belief
had
been
steadily
growing
in
him
while
his
inherited
thrift
and
his
improved
on
the
farming
methods
of
greenfield
it
crystallized
into
a
creed
when
his
old
friend
laughed
at
his
idea
of
replacing
horses
with
a
machine
he
had
visited
the
shops
which
interested
him
ordered
the
material
he
wanted
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
station
to
take
the
train
home
when
he
remembered
the
shopping
list
ford
had
given
him
and
her
repeated
injunctions
to
attend
to
it
the
very
first
thing
he
did
with
the
usual
exclamation
of
a
husband
saved
by
a
sudden
thought
on
the
very
brink
of
domestic
catastrophe
henry
ford
turned
and
hurried
back
to
make
those
purchases
aided
by
a
sympathetic
clerk
at
the
ribbon
counter
he
completed
them
satisfactorily
and
came
out
of
the
store
laden
with
bundles
just
at
the
moment
that
detroit
pride
a
new
fire
engine
came
puffing
around
the
corner
it
was
going
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
miles
an
hour
with
impressive
clatter
and
clang
pouring
clouds
of
black
smoke
from
the
stack
detroit
citizens
crowded
the
sidewalks
to
view
it
as
it
went
by
henry
ford
gripping
his
bundles
stood
on
the
curb
and
looked
at
it
here
was
his
first
chance
to
see
a
steam
engine
built
to
run
without
a
prepared
roadbed
and
rails
it
was
the
original
of
one
of
those
pictures
we
sometimes
see
now
with
a
smile
murmuring
how
quaint
a
huge
round
boiler
standing
high
in
the
back
supplied
fully
half
its
bulk
ford
made
a
hasty
calculation
of
the
probable
weight
of
water
it
carried
in
proportion
to
its
power
the
result
appalled
him
he
thoughtfully
watched
the
engine
until
it
was
out
of
sight
then
he
resumed
his
way
home
on
the
train
he
sat
in
deep
thought
now
and
then
figuring
a
little
on
the
back
of
an
old
envelope
i
could
get
that
steam
engine
out
of
my
mind
he
says
what
an
awful
waste
of
power
the
weight
of
the
water
in
that
boiler
bothered
me
for
weeks
chapter
x
why
not
use
gasoline
one
sympathizes
with
young
ford
during
the
weeks
that
followed
in
two
years
of
marriage
she
had
learned
to
understand
her
interests
and
moods
fairly
well
she
had
adjusted
herself
with
fewer
domestic
discords
than
usual
to
the
simple
demands
of
his
methodical
temperament
she
had
begun
to
settle
into
a
pleasant
accustomed
routine
of
managing
her
house
and
poultry
yard
preparing
the
meals
washing
the
dishes
spending
the
evenings
sewing
while
henry
read
his
mechanics
journals
on
the
other
side
of
the
lamp
now
everything
changed
henry
had
returned
from
that
trip
to
detroit
with
something
on
his
mind
in
reply
to
her
anxious
inquiries
he
told
her
not
to
bother
he
was
all
right
a
statement
that
had
the
usual
effect
of
confirming
her
fears
she
was
sure
something
terrible
had
occurred
some
overwhelming
business
catastrophe
and
henry
was
keeping
it
from
her
from
the
kitchen
window
she
saw
him
sitting
idly
on
the
in
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
twisting
a
straw
in
his
fingers
and
frowning
intently
at
the
side
of
the
barn
sometimes
after
supper
instead
of
settling
quietly
down
with
his
papers
he
walked
up
and
down
up
and
down
the
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
that
same
frown
on
his
forehead
at
last
she
could
endure
it
no
longer
she
begged
him
to
tell
her
the
worst
he
replied
surprised
that
it
was
a
steam
engine
he
could
figure
out
the
ratio
of
power
to
weight
satisfactorily
the
blame
thing
bothered
him
oh
is
that
all
ford
said
indignantly
well
i
would
bother
about
it
if
i
were
you
what
does
an
old
steam
engine
matter
anyhow
come
and
sit
down
and
forget
about
it
it
was
the
one
thing
ford
could
not
do
his
mind
once
started
on
the
project
of
building
an
engine
to
use
on
the
farm
remained
obstinately
at
work
on
the
details
he
spent
weeks
considering
them
one
by
one
thinking
out
adaptations
new
devices
in
an
effort
to
overcome
the
difficulty
still
he
could
not
see
how
to
construct
a
cheap
engine
which
would
pull
across
his
soft
fields
carry
the
necessary
weight
of
water
and
still
develop
enough
free
power
to
be
useful
he
was
still
struggling
with
the
problem
three
months
after
his
trip
to
detroit
i
declare
to
goodness
i
do
know
what
got
into
you
henry
you
act
like
a
man
in
a
dream
half
the
time
the
wife
said
worried
you
are
coming
down
with
a
fever
are
you
i
should
say
not
henry
replied
hastily
with
visions
of
brewed
snakeroot
and
wormwood
i
feel
fine
where
the
milk
pail
he
took
it
and
his
lantern
and
hurried
out
to
the
barn
but
even
while
he
sat
on
the
stool
his
practiced
hands
sending
streams
of
warm
milk
foaming
into
the
pail
his
mind
returned
to
that
problem
of
the
steam
engine
he
was
sure
a
machine
could
be
made
to
do
the
work
of
horses
he
was
confident
that
he
could
make
it
if
he
persisted
long
enough
the
trouble
was
the
weight
of
the
water
he
must
have
it
to
make
steam
he
must
have
steam
to
develop
power
and
the
whole
power
was
required
to
haul
the
water
it
looked
like
an
inexorable
circle
he
went
over
it
again
looking
for
the
weak
spot
in
the
reasoning
and
suddenly
he
saw
it
steam
was
not
necessary
why
not
use
gasoline
the
thought
opened
a
door
into
unknown
possibilities
up
to
that
time
as
far
as
he
knew
no
one
had
ever
dreamed
of
a
gasoline
engine
a
thousand
obstacles
rose
immediately
before
his
mind
the
gearing
the
drive
the
construction
of
the
engine
itself
a
dazzling
array
of
problems
to
be
faced
and
solved
difficulties
innumerable
stood
in
the
way
of
his
carrying
out
the
idea
difficulties
apparently
so
insurmountable
that
men
in
a
hundred
would
have
abandoned
the
idea
as
impossible
after
one
glance
at
them
henry
ford
was
the
hundredth
man
they
were
mechanical
difficulties
and
he
loved
mechanics
he
was
eager
for
the
struggle
with
them
it
seemed
to
take
me
a
year
to
finish
the
chores
so
i
could
sit
down
some
place
and
figure
it
out
he
says
he
finished
the
milking
fed
the
waiting
circle
of
cats
flashed
his
lantern
down
the
rows
of
stalls
to
be
sure
the
horses
were
well
fed
and
comfortable
fastened
the
barn
doors
and
hastened
into
the
house
with
the
milk
every
moment
seemed
wasted
until
he
could
reach
the
quiet
spread
paper
and
pencils
in
the
lamplight
and
begin
to
work
out
some
of
those
problems
he
had
never
disliked
the
chores
so
much
from
that
time
his
distaste
for
farm
work
grew
nature
would
not
delay
her
orderly
cycle
because
henry
ford
wanted
to
spend
his
days
in
the
little
farm
shop
weeds
sprang
up
and
must
be
cut
crops
ripened
and
must
be
harvested
morning
came
with
a
hundred
imperative
demands
on
his
time
and
strength
and
night
brought
the
chores
all
the
farm
tasks
were
to
ford
only
vexing
obstacles
in
his
way
to
his
real
work
and
they
kept
him
from
it
till
late
at
night
then
when
all
greenfield
was
asleep
and
ford
after
a
long
struggle
to
keep
awake
had
gone
yawning
to
bed
he
sat
alone
and
worked
over
the
problem
of
his
gasoline
engine
he
ransacked
the
piles
of
mechanics
journals
for
suggestions
where
they
failed
him
he
tried
to
think
his
way
ahead
without
help
while
he
worked
through
the
night
in
a
stillness
broken
only
by
the
crowing
of
a
rooster
in
some
distant
farmyard
and
the
sputtering
of
the
lamp
the
possibilities
of
his
idea
gradually
grew
in
his
mind
he
was
not
an
imaginative
man
the
details
of
the
engine
absorbed
most
of
his
attention
but
now
and
then
as
the
night
wore
on
toward
morning
he
had
a
dim
understanding
of
the
possibilities
of
horseless
transportation
he
thought
what
it
might
mean
to
the
world
if
every
man
had
a
machine
to
carry
him
and
his
goods
over
the
country
at
a
speed
of
twenty
or
even
miles
an
hour
it
was
a
fantastic
vision
he
admitted
but
he
set
his
teeth
and
declared
that
it
was
not
an
impossible
one
sometimes
he
worked
all
night
usually
weariness
overcame
him
in
the
small
hours
and
he
was
forced
to
stop
and
go
through
another
day
work
on
the
farm
before
he
could
get
back
to
his
real
interests
again
if
the
farm
was
to
prosper
he
must
give
it
his
attention
every
day
the
margin
of
time
it
allowed
for
his
work
on
the
gasoline
engine
plans
was
far
too
little
by
the
end
of
that
summer
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
not
spare
his
time
for
the
farm
he
told
his
wife
that
he
had
decided
to
lease
it
to
his
brother
and
move
to
detroit
my
goodness
henry
what
for
we
doing
well
here
i
sure
going
ahead
faster
than
any
one
in
the
neighborhood
she
said
in
astonishment
i
want
to
get
back
to
work
in
the
machine
shops
i
ca
do
any
work
on
my
gasoline
engine
here
even
if
i
had
the
time
i
have
the
equipment
he
explained
well
i
must
say
here
we
worked
hard
and
got
a
comfortable
home
and
a
fine
farm
that
pays
more
every
year
and
sixteen
head
of
good
stock
and
you
going
to
leave
it
all
for
a
gasoline
engine
that
even
built
i
do
see
what
you
thinking
of
said
poor
ford
confronted
thus
suddenly
with
the
prospect
of
giving
up
all
her
accustomed
ways
her
old
friends
her
big
house
with
its
stock
of
linens
and
its
cellar
filled
with
good
things
you
ca
begin
to
make
as
much
in
the
city
as
you
do
here
she
argued
reasonably
and
suppose
the
engine
does
work
after
all
it
work
all
right
i
going
to
keep
at
it
till
it
does
ford
said
chapter
xi
back
to
detroit
ford
opinion
was
now
shared
by
the
whole
greenfield
neighborhood
as
soon
as
it
learned
ford
intention
of
leaving
his
fine
paying
farm
and
moving
to
detroit
to
work
in
a
machine
shop
you
had
this
notion
once
before
you
know
when
you
were
a
youngster
his
father
reminded
him
i
thought
you
made
up
your
mind
to
stay
here
where
you
can
make
a
good
living
and
have
some
peace
and
comfort
he
listened
to
his
son
explanation
of
the
possibilities
in
a
gasoline
engine
and
he
shook
his
head
i
guess
you
can
build
it
if
anybody
can
but
you
ca
ever
tell
about
these
inventions
looks
to
me
you
better
stick
to
a
good
farm
where
you
your
own
boss
and
there
always
plenty
in
the
cupboard
whatever
happens
instead
of
going
off
to
a
city
job
you
may
build
that
contrivance
of
yours
and
then
again
you
may
not
and
look
how
you
be
living
in
the
meantime
but
henry
was
firm
with
a
determination
which
is
called
obstinacy
when
it
goes
with
failure
and
great
will
power
when
it
is
coupled
with
success
he
was
going
to
the
city
that
settled
it
after
her
first
protest
ford
accepted
the
situation
and
set
herself
with
what
philosophy
she
might
to
packing
her
linen
and
wrapping
the
furniture
she
had
no
great
interest
in
the
gasoline
engine
machinery
in
general
was
to
her
merely
something
greasy
and
whirring
to
hold
her
skirts
away
from
but
if
henry
was
going
to
detroit
of
course
she
was
going
too
and
she
might
as
well
be
cheerful
about
it
the
rosy
teasing
country
girl
who
had
kept
henry
ford
from
his
beloved
machines
nearly
five
years
before
by
her
laughing
refusal
to
choose
between
her
suitors
had
developed
into
a
cheerful
capable
little
housewife
the
kind
of
woman
whose
place
is
in
the
home
because
there
she
does
her
best
work
she
could
never
invent
a
gasoline
engine
but
she
was
an
ideal
person
to
take
care
of
henry
ford
while
he
did
it
to
keep
the
house
clean
and
comfortable
cook
good
meals
cheer
him
a
bit
when
he
was
depressed
and
never
have
nerves
she
went
briskly
to
work
and
in
no
time
she
had
packed
away
the
thousand
articles
that
meant
home
to
her
and
they
stood
wrapped
crated
labeled
ready
to
move
to
detroit
meantime
ford
had
arranged
for
the
lease
of
the
farm
and
for
the
storage
of
the
furniture
until
he
should
have
found
a
house
in
the
city
ford
was
going
there
with
him
and
they
would
live
in
a
boarding
house
until
he
got
a
job
on
the
last
morning
when
he
picked
up
the
telescope
bags
ready
to
start
to
the
station
his
wife
went
over
to
the
house
for
the
last
time
to
see
that
everything
was
snug
and
safe
to
leave
then
she
came
into
the
parlor
where
he
was
waiting
and
looked
around
the
bare
room
stripped
of
its
bright
brussels
carpets
lace
curtains
and
shiny
furniture
well
we
come
back
some
day
wo
we
she
said
when
the
gasoline
engine
is
built
she
had
spoken
for
the
first
time
a
phrase
they
were
to
repeat
frequently
with
every
accent
of
expectation
hope
discouragement
and
irony
during
the
next
ten
years
when
the
gasoline
engine
is
built
a
crowd
of
their
friends
gathered
at
the
station
to
say
with
an
intention
of
being
tactful
they
avoided
any
mention
of
henry
purpose
in
leaving
greenfield
sorry
to
lose
you
ford
hope
you
be
coming
back
before
long
they
said
and
he
knew
the
neighborhood
had
learned
of
his
intention
to
invent
something
and
thought
him
suddenly
become
a
fool
as
soon
as
they
reached
detroit
and
found
a
boarding
house
where
he
could
leave
his
wife
he
started
out
to
get
a
job
he
wanted
one
where
he
could
learn
something
about
electricity
so
far
his
knowledge
of
it
was
purely
theoretical
gained
from
reading
and
thinking
electric
lights
had
come
to
detroit
since
he
left
it
the
edison
electric
lighting
and
power
company
had
established
three
power
stations
there
he
asked
nothing
better
than
a
chance
to
work
in
one
of
them
charles
gilbert
manager
of
the
plants
was
having
a
hard
time
that
morning
by
one
of
those
freaks
of
fate
which
must
be
left
out
of
any
fiction
plot
because
they
are
too
improbable
two
of
his
engines
had
chosen
that
day
to
break
down
simultaneously
one
of
the
engineers
who
had
been
responsible
had
been
summarily
discharged
the
others
were
working
on
the
engine
in
the
main
plant
and
one
of
the
was
entirely
out
of
commission
with
no
prospect
of
getting
to
work
on
it
until
the
next
day
into
this
situation
henry
ford
walked
and
asked
for
a
job
he
looked
to
me
like
any
tramp
engineer
charles
gilbert
says
a
young
fellow
not
very
more
of
a
slight
wiry
build
you
would
have
noticed
him
at
all
in
a
crowd
he
talked
like
a
steady
capable
fellow
but
if
he
had
come
in
on
any
other
day
i
have
said
we
could
use
him
as
it
was
i
thought
i
might
as
well
give
him
a
chance
he
listened
to
ford
looked
him
over
know
anything
about
steam
engines
he
asked
him
ford
said
he
did
well
the
engine
at
a
quit
this
morning
i
got
a
couple
of
mechanics
working
on
it
but
they
do
seem
to
be
doing
much
get
out
there
and
see
what
you
can
do
and
let
me
know
all
right
sir
ford
replied
and
went
it
was
then
about
ten
in
the
morning
gilbert
busy
with
the
troubles
in
the
main
plant
heard
no
more
from
a
until
that
evening
then
a
small
boy
arrived
with
a
message
engine
running
o
ford
gilbert
went
out
to
the
the
engine
in
perfect
order
was
roaring
in
the
basement
on
the
first
floor
the
dynamos
were
going
at
full
speed
his
worries
with
a
were
over
he
went
down
to
the
engine
and
found
ford
busy
with
an
oil
can
want
the
job
of
night
engineer
here
gilbert
asked
him
pays
a
month
go
to
work
right
now
if
you
say
so
ford
assured
him
all
right
i
have
another
man
here
to
relieve
you
at
six
in
the
morning
come
down
to
the
office
some
time
and
i
put
your
name
on
the
payroll
in
one
day
ford
had
got
the
very
opportunity
he
wanted
a
job
where
he
could
study
electricity
at
first
hand
an
hour
later
ford
who
had
spent
the
day
drearily
unpacking
trunks
and
putting
the
telescope
bags
under
the
bed
in
a
hopeless
attempt
to
make
a
bedroom
homelike
received
an
enthusiastic
note
got
fine
job
already
working
all
night
go
to
bed
and
do
worry
everything
is
settled
henry
he
had
forgotten
to
mention
that
his
wages
were
dollars
a
month
chapter
xii
learning
about
electricity
dollars
a
month
and
a
job
for
these
henry
ford
had
traded
his
big
pleasant
home
with
its
assured
comfort
and
plenty
and
his
place
as
one
of
the
most
prosperous
and
respected
men
in
greenfield
the
change
would
have
been
a
calamity
to
most
men
henry
ford
was
happy
the
new
job
gave
him
a
chance
to
work
with
machinery
an
opportunity
to
learn
all
about
electricity
his
contentment
as
he
went
whistling
about
his
work
after
gilbert
left
would
have
seemed
pure
insanity
to
the
average
person
dollars
a
month
you
see
i
never
did
bother
much
about
money
he
says
my
wages
were
enough
for
food
and
shelter
and
that
was
all
i
wanted
money
matters
always
seemed
to
sort
of
take
care
of
themselves
some
way
it
always
that
way
if
a
man
is
working
at
something
he
likes
he
bound
to
work
hard
at
it
and
then
the
money
comes
worrying
about
money
is
about
the
worst
thing
a
man
can
do
it
takes
his
mind
off
his
work
his
philosophy
apparently
justified
itself
in
the
months
that
followed
a
had
no
more
breakdowns
now
and
then
manager
gilbert
inquired
how
the
new
man
was
getting
along
a
wizard
at
machinery
had
some
trouble
with
the
dynamo
last
night
and
he
had
it
fixed
in
no
time
he
heard
or
say
where
you
get
him
he
knows
more
about
this
plant
than
the
man
that
built
it
ford
himself
was
not
in
evidence
the
manager
quitting
work
at
about
the
time
ford
arrived
at
the
for
the
night
shift
did
not
see
him
again
until
one
day
at
the
end
of
three
months
the
engine
at
the
main
plant
stopped
the
engineer
in
charge
looked
at
it
and
shook
his
head
ca
do
anything
with
it
till
he
said
we
have
to
take
it
down
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
the
engine
was
needed
to
keep
detroit
lighted
that
night
gilbert
remembering
the
reports
of
the
new
man
sent
for
ford
he
came
and
fixed
the
engine
it
was
all
in
the
day
work
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
went
back
to
a
and
forgot
the
incident
he
does
not
remember
it
now
gilbert
remembered
it
but
he
did
not
go
out
of
his
way
to
pay
any
attention
to
ford
he
simply
forgot
about
the
mechanical
work
of
a
he
knew
ford
would
take
care
of
it
a
manager
spends
his
time
and
thought
on
the
poor
workmen
a
good
man
he
leaves
alone
when
ford
had
been
with
the
edison
company
six
months
drawing
his
dollars
regularly
and
handing
it
to
ford
to
pay
the
landlady
he
knew
the
edison
plants
from
the
basements
up
he
had
become
enthusiastic
over
electrical
problems
in
his
idle
time
after
his
twelve
hours
work
at
the
he
was
planning
the
batteries
and
for
his
gasoline
engine
about
that
time
a
shift
in
the
force
left
vacant
the
place
of
manager
of
the
mechanical
department
gilbert
sent
for
ford
think
you
can
handle
the
job
he
asked
him
yes
i
can
handle
it
ford
said
gilbert
gave
him
the
job
when
he
drew
his
pay
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
found
he
was
getting
now
he
said
to
himself
i
got
to
have
a
place
of
my
own
where
i
can
work
on
my
gasoline
engine
at
night
now
we
can
have
a
home
of
our
own
and
get
away
from
this
awful
ford
exclaimed
when
he
told
her
the
news
and
he
contrasting
the
supper
he
had
just
eaten
with
memories
of
her
excellent
cooking
heartily
agreed
besides
it
seemed
to
him
that
paying
rent
was
wasting
money
he
proposed
to
buy
a
lot
and
build
on
it
they
talked
it
over
walking
up
and
down
detroit
wide
streets
in
the
evening
next
morning
early
ford
put
on
her
hat
and
went
down
to
the
real
estate
offices
before
night
two
hustling
young
salesmen
had
interviewed
ford
at
the
edison
plant
and
when
he
came
home
that
night
another
one
was
waiting
on
the
steps
that
week
was
a
busy
one
ford
worked
from
six
in
the
morning
to
six
at
night
in
the
edison
plant
hurried
home
to
find
ford
waiting
with
eagerness
to
tell
him
of
the
lots
she
had
seen
that
day
and
before
he
had
finished
his
supper
he
was
snatched
away
from
it
to
hear
an
enthusiastic
salesman
describe
still
other
bargains
in
detroit
real
estate
impatient
to
be
at
work
on
his
drawings
for
the
gasoline
engine
he
was
taken
from
end
to
end
of
the
city
to
inspect
homesites
he
was
experiencing
that
agony
of
all
workers
being
obliged
to
spend
so
much
time
preparing
a
place
to
work
that
there
was
none
left
for
the
work
this
thing
has
to
stop
he
said
in
desperation
to
his
wife
one
evening
i
been
inquiring
around
a
little
and
i
think
the
best
place
to
buy
is
out
on
edison
avenue
put
on
your
hat
and
we
go
out
and
decide
on
one
of
those
lots
we
saw
last
saturday
they
went
out
and
looked
them
over
on
one
of
the
lots
was
an
old
shed
ford
examined
it
if
this
place
suits
you
we
take
it
he
said
this
shed
will
make
a
shop
without
much
fixing
i
build
the
gasoline
engine
here
ford
looked
about
at
the
scattered
little
houses
and
bare
lots
it
was
spring
the
grass
was
beginning
to
sprout
and
the
smell
of
the
damp
earth
and
the
feeling
of
space
reminded
her
of
the
country
she
liked
it
all
right
let
buy
this
one
she
said
a
few
days
later
they
signed
the
contract
the
lot
cost
seven
hundred
dollars
fifty
dollars
down
and
the
rest
in
monthly
payments
ford
drew
from
the
savings
bank
two
hundred
dollars
his
bank
balance
at
the
time
he
left
the
farm
and
bought
lumber
after
that
he
spent
his
evenings
building
the
house
while
he
hammered
and
sawed
ford
was
at
work
in
the
yard
she
set
out
rose
bushes
planted
a
vegetable
garden
behind
the
shed
the
neighboring
women
came
over
to
get
acquainted
and
asked
her
to
come
in
some
time
and
bring
her
sewing
as
soon
as
she
got
settled
after
those
six
months
in
a
dreary
boarding
house
it
must
have
been
pleasant
to
her
to
see
the
beginnings
of
a
home
and
a
friendly
circle
again
this
seems
to
be
a
nice
neighborhood
i
think
we
going
to
enjoy
it
here
she
said
later
to
her
husband
holding
the
lantern
while
he
nailed
down
the
floors
long
after
dark
that
good
glad
you
like
it
he
answered
i
wish
the
place
was
finished
so
i
could
get
to
work
meantime
at
the
edison
plant
he
was
making
his
first
experiments
in
applying
his
to
the
managing
of
men
chapter
xiii
eight
hours
but
not
for
himself
when
henry
ford
became
manager
of
the
mechanical
department
the
workmen
in
the
edison
plants
were
working
shifts
as
a
matter
of
course
in
those
days
the
theory
of
practically
all
employers
was
that
men
like
the
rest
of
their
equipment
should
be
worked
to
the
limit
of
their
strength
we
had
about
forty
men
on
the
regular
list
and
four
or
five
substitutes
who
were
kept
busy
filling
in
for
the
regular
men
who
were
sick
or
tired
out
he
said
i
had
been
in
charge
long
before
it
struck
me
there
was
something
wrong
if
our
machines
had
broken
down
as
often
as
our
men
did
anybody
would
have
known
we
were
handling
them
right
no
good
engineer
will
run
a
machine
at
the
limit
of
its
power
and
speed
for
very
long
it
hurts
the
machine
it
is
sentimentalism
to
take
care
of
the
machine
it
plain
common
sense
and
efficiency
it
sentimentalism
to
look
out
for
the
interests
of
the
men
the
sooner
people
get
over
the
idea
that
there
a
difference
between
ideals
of
brotherhood
and
practical
common
sense
the
sooner
we
do
away
with
waste
and
friction
of
all
kinds
and
have
a
world
that
run
right
the
only
trouble
now
is
that
people
have
the
courage
to
put
their
ideals
to
work
they
say
of
course
theoretically
we
believe
in
them
but
they
are
practical
what
the
use
of
believing
in
anything
that
is
practical
if
it
any
good
at
all
it
practical
the
whole
progress
of
the
world
has
been
made
by
men
who
went
to
work
and
used
their
impractical
theories
well
i
figured
over
the
situation
quite
a
while
and
i
found
out
that
by
putting
the
substitutes
on
the
regular
list
and
shifting
the
men
around
a
little
i
could
give
them
all
an
day
without
increasing
the
pay
roll
i
did
it
yes
there
was
a
howl
from
the
stockholders
when
they
heard
about
it
nobody
had
ever
tried
it
before
they
thought
i
was
going
to
turn
everything
upside
down
and
ruin
the
business
but
the
work
was
going
along
better
than
before
the
men
felt
more
like
work
and
they
pitched
in
to
show
they
appreciated
being
treated
right
we
had
fewer
breakdowns
after
that
everything
went
better
after
the
thing
was
done
it
was
easy
enough
to
prove
that
it
paid
and
the
stockholders
quieted
down
after
one
or
two
complaints
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
believe
in
any
hours
for
work
a
man
ought
to
work
as
long
as
he
wants
to
and
he
ought
to
enjoy
his
work
so
much
that
he
wants
to
work
as
long
as
he
can
it
only
monotonous
grinding
work
that
needs
an
day
when
a
man
is
creating
something
working
to
get
results
twelve
or
fourteen
hours
a
day
does
hurt
him
ford
put
this
theory
into
practice
as
apparently
he
had
done
with
all
his
theories
he
himself
worked
more
than
fourteen
hours
a
day
from
to
he
worked
in
the
edison
plant
for
his
régime
did
not
apply
to
himself
then
he
hastened
home
to
the
little
house
on
edison
avenue
ate
supper
and
hurried
out
to
his
improvised
workshop
in
the
old
shed
he
turned
on
the
big
electric
lights
and
there
in
the
glare
lay
materials
for
his
gasoline
engine
his
real
work
which
at
last
he
could
begin
until
late
at
night
the
neighbors
heard
the
sound
of
his
tools
and
saw
the
glare
of
light
through
the
cracks
the
smiths
are
giving
a
party
i
suppose
we
ca
go
ford
said
one
evening
wistfully
oh
well
when
the
gasoline
engine
is
finished
how
long
do
you
think
it
going
to
take
i
do
know
i
working
on
the
cylinder
now
i
have
to
have
a
larger
bore
to
get
the
speed
and
then
there
be
the
transmission
ford
stopped
speaking
and
was
lost
in
the
problems
he
finished
supper
abstractedly
and
pushed
back
his
chair
oh
about
the
party
too
bad
i
hope
you
do
mind
much
when
i
get
the
gasoline
engine
finished
he
said
apologetically
and
hurried
out
to
work
on
it
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
absorbed
with
the
cylinder
he
had
found
that
day
a
piece
of
pipe
thrown
into
the
scrap
heap
at
the
edison
plant
and
it
had
struck
him
at
once
that
it
would
do
for
his
cylinder
and
that
using
it
would
save
him
the
time
and
work
of
making
one
he
brought
it
home
cut
it
to
the
right
length
and
set
it
in
the
first
ford
engine
meantime
in
the
house
ford
cleared
away
the
supper
dishes
took
out
her
sewing
and
settled
down
with
a
sigh
the
neighbors
were
going
by
to
the
smiths
party
she
could
hear
them
laughing
and
calling
to
each
other
on
the
sidewalk
outside
in
the
shed
her
husband
was
filing
something
the
rasp
of
the
file
on
the
metal
sounded
plainly
after
all
she
thought
she
might
as
well
give
up
the
idea
of
parties
she
could
give
one
herself
she
knew
henry
would
refuse
to
leave
his
hateful
engine
even
for
one
evening
she
was
very
homesick
for
greenfield
the
months
went
by
ford
worked
all
day
at
the
edison
plant
half
the
night
in
his
own
shop
the
men
he
met
in
his
work
had
taken
to
looking
at
him
half
in
amusement
half
in
contempt
he
was
a
crank
they
said
some
of
the
younger
ones
would
laugh
and
tap
their
foreheads
when
he
had
gone
past
them
one
night
he
came
home
and
found
ford
crying
the
neighbors
were
saying
that
he
was
crazy
she
sobbed
she
told
lessing
just
exactly
what
she
thought
of
her
too
and
she
never
speak
to
her
again
but
oh
would
he
ever
get
that
horrid
engine
finished
so
they
could
live
like
other
people
it
all
hurt
no
man
was
ever
friendlier
or
enjoyed
more
the
feeling
of
comradeship
with
other
men
than
ford
but
it
was
a
choice
between
that
and
his
automobile
he
went
on
with
his
routine
of
work
fourteen
or
sixteen
hours
of
it
every
day
and
he
drew
more
into
himself
became
more
reserved
with
every
month
that
passed
if
any
man
ever
followed
emerson
doctrine
of
giving
up
friends
and
family
in
his
devotion
to
his
own
work
that
man
was
henry
ford
in
those
days
there
was
nothing
dramatic
about
it
just
an
obscure
machinist
with
an
idea
willing
to
give
up
social
pleasures
restful
domestic
evenings
the
good
opinion
of
his
neighbors
and
work
hard
in
an
old
shed
behind
his
common
little
house
only
an
ordinary
man
turning
his
back
on
everything
most
of
us
want
for
an
impractical
theory
that
was
all
he
continued
to
work
for
two
years
he
built
the
engine
slowly
thinking
out
every
step
in
advance
drawing
every
casting
before
he
made
it
struggling
for
months
over
the
problem
of
the
electrical
wiring
and
spark
sometimes
he
worked
all
night
sick
no
i
never
was
sick
he
says
it
is
overworking
that
breaks
men
down
it
overplaying
and
overeating
i
never
ate
too
much
and
i
felt
all
right
no
matter
how
long
i
worked
of
course
sometimes
i
was
pretty
tired
one
day
he
called
his
wife
out
to
the
shed
the
little
engine
set
up
on
blocks
was
humming
away
its
flywheel
a
blur
in
the
air
the
revolutions
that
made
the
automobile
possible
were
an
accomplished
fact
oh
henry
it
done
you
finished
it
she
said
happily
no
that
just
the
beginning
now
i
got
to
figure
out
the
transmission
the
steering
gear
and
a
a
lot
of
things
he
replied
chapter
xiv
struggling
with
the
first
car
ford
was
now
a
man
of
nearly
an
insignificant
unimportant
unit
in
the
business
world
of
detroit
merely
one
of
the
subordinate
managers
in
the
edison
plant
seeing
him
on
his
way
home
from
work
a
slender
stooping
poorly
dressed
man
the
firm
set
of
his
lips
hidden
by
the
sandy
mustache
he
wore
then
and
his
blue
eyes
already
surrounded
by
a
network
of
tired
wrinkles
men
probably
looked
at
him
and
said
there
a
man
who
will
never
get
anywhere
he
had
his
farm
unprofitable
since
he
had
left
it
a
small
home
partly
paid
for
and
the
little
gas
engine
to
show
for
fourteen
years
of
hard
work
probably
he
received
more
than
one
letter
from
his
father
and
brothers
in
greenfield
urging
him
to
come
back
to
the
farm
where
he
and
his
wife
might
live
comfortably
among
their
old
friends
and
he
need
not
work
so
hard
it
would
have
seemed
a
wise
move
but
with
the
completion
of
the
little
engine
ford
was
more
than
ever
possessed
by
his
idea
he
brought
one
or
two
of
the
men
from
the
edison
shop
to
see
it
they
watched
it
whirring
away
on
its
pedestal
of
blocks
they
examined
its
large
cylinder
its
piston
noted
its
power
and
looked
at
ford
with
some
increased
respect
but
most
of
them
were
nevertheless
doubtful
of
the
success
of
the
automobile
the
idea
of
a
horseless
carriage
in
general
use
still
seemed
to
them
fantastic
well
looks
like
you
could
make
it
go
they
conceded
but
it
going
to
be
pretty
expensive
to
run
not
many
people
want
to
buy
it
and
where
will
you
get
the
capital
to
manufacture
it
i
making
it
cheap
i
going
to
make
it
cheap
enough
so
every
man
in
this
country
can
have
one
before
i
through
ford
said
already
his
belief
that
a
thing
is
any
good
unless
it
good
for
everybody
was
taking
form
he
did
not
intend
to
make
a
few
toys
for
wealthy
men
he
planned
to
make
something
useful
for
thousands
of
men
like
himself
who
were
wasting
money
in
keeping
idle
horses
as
he
had
done
on
the
farm
he
still
meant
to
make
a
farm
tractor
as
soon
as
he
had
worked
out
the
principle
of
a
machine
as
to
the
capital
he
believed
that
question
would
take
care
of
itself
when
the
time
came
his
job
was
to
make
the
machine
and
he
did
not
waste
time
telling
himself
that
there
was
no
chance
for
a
poor
man
the
problem
of
transmitting
the
power
of
the
engine
to
the
wheels
now
engrossed
his
attention
he
brought
home
materials
for
a
light
buggy
frame
and
built
it
four
old
bicycle
wheels
were
repaired
fitted
with
heavy
rims
and
large
pneumatic
tires
and
placed
on
the
axles
the
question
then
was
how
to
attach
the
engine
to
us
familiar
with
automobiles
it
seems
simple
enough
but
when
ford
stood
in
the
old
shed
looking
at
the
buggy
frame
and
then
at
the
little
engine
he
was
attempting
a
feat
that
had
never
been
accomplished
always
before
carriages
had
been
pulled
naturally
enough
his
first
thought
was
to
apply
the
power
of
the
engine
to
the
front
wheels
then
how
should
he
steer
what
mechanism
should
he
use
powerful
enough
to
turn
the
hind
wheels
against
the
pull
of
the
engine
and
flexible
enough
to
respond
quickly
and
make
a
sharp
turn
then
there
was
the
problem
of
the
throttle
and
the
gears
the
machine
must
be
able
to
go
more
slowly
or
to
pick
up
speed
again
without
shutting
off
the
power
the
driver
must
be
able
when
necessary
to
throw
off
the
power
entirely
and
to
apply
it
quickly
again
without
stopping
the
engine
all
these
vexing
questions
and
many
minor
ones
were
to
be
solved
and
always
there
was
the
big
question
of
simplicity
the
machine
must
be
cheap
i
building
this
thing
so
it
will
be
useful
ford
said
once
while
he
was
in
the
thick
of
his
perplexities
there
is
any
object
in
working
at
it
unless
it
will
be
useful
and
it
wo
be
useful
unless
it
cheap
enough
so
common
people
can
have
it
and
do
their
work
with
it
the
essential
democracy
of
the
man
spoke
then
it
is
the
distinctly
american
viewpoint
of
the
man
who
for
years
had
fought
sun
and
wind
and
weather
tearing
his
food
and
shelter
from
the
stubborn
grasp
of
the
soil
and
who
now
struggles
with
mechanical
obstacles
determined
in
spite
of
them
to
make
something
for
practical
use
his
standards
of
value
were
not
beauty
or
ease
of
luxury
he
wanted
to
make
a
machine
that
would
do
the
greatest
possible
quantity
of
good
hard
work
his
third
winter
in
the
house
on
edison
avenue
arrived
and
still
the
automobile
was
not
completed
when
he
went
out
to
work
in
the
old
shed
after
supper
he
lighted
a
fire
in
the
rusty
heating
stove
set
up
in
a
corner
and
often
ford
came
out
and
sat
on
a
box
watching
while
he
fitted
parts
together
or
tried
different
transmission
devices
he
had
settled
finally
on
a
leather
belt
passing
over
the
flywheel
and
connecting
with
the
rear
axle
a
pulley
arrangement
controlled
by
a
lever
tightened
or
loosened
this
belt
thus
increasing
or
decreasing
the
speed
of
the
automobile
that
broad
strip
of
leather
inclosed
running
from
the
engine
on
the
rear
axle
to
the
pulley
under
the
front
seat
was
the
parent
of
the
planetary
system
of
transmission
ford
worked
on
it
all
winter
it
was
a
lonely
time
for
ford
for
the
general
attitude
of
the
neighborhood
toward
her
husband
had
roused
her
good
country
temper
and
she
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
people
who
talked
like
that
she
knew
henry
was
perfectly
sane
a
better
husband
than
most
of
them
had
too
and
anyhow
it
was
none
of
their
business
how
henry
spent
his
time
and
if
they
did
like
they
could
lump
it
nevertheless
as
the
winter
days
followed
each
other
in
an
apparently
endless
procession
she
grew
moody
the
baby
was
coming
and
she
was
homesick
for
greenfield
and
the
big
comfortable
country
home
with
friends
running
in
and
out
and
the
sound
of
sleighbells
jingling
past
on
the
road
outside
she
put
the
little
house
to
rights
in
the
morning
and
faced
a
long
lonely
day
she
sewed
a
while
wandered
about
the
rooms
looking
out
on
the
dreary
little
street
with
its
scattered
houses
and
dirty
trampled
snow
yawned
and
counted
the
hours
till
her
husband
would
come
home
for
supper
when
he
came
she
had
the
house
warm
and
bright
the
table
set
hot
biscuits
browning
in
the
oven
she
dished
up
the
food
poured
the
tea
brought
the
hot
plates
they
sat
down
to
eat
and
talk
and
the
minutes
seemed
to
fly
before
she
had
said
half
she
had
stored
up
through
the
day
before
henry
had
more
than
begun
to
talk
he
pushed
back
his
plate
drank
his
tea
and
said
well
i
must
be
getting
to
work
then
he
went
out
to
the
shed
and
forgot
her
in
the
absorbing
interest
of
the
automobile
oh
when
is
it
going
to
be
finished
she
said
one
night
after
she
had
been
sitting
for
a
long
time
in
silence
watching
him
at
work
on
it
she
began
the
sentence
cheerfully
but
she
caught
her
breath
at
the
end
and
began
to
cry
i
help
it
i
sorry
i
to
go
home
to
greenfield
she
said
ford
was
testing
the
steering
gear
he
dropped
his
tools
in
surprise
and
went
over
to
comfort
her
there
there
he
said
i
suppose
patting
her
back
clumsily
in
the
awkward
way
of
a
man
unaccustomed
to
quieting
a
sobbing
woman
done
now
it
practically
done
now
it
just
needs
a
little
more
she
interrupted
him
she
said
his
horrid
old
engine
was
always
just
needing
a
little
more
she
said
she
wanted
him
to
take
her
back
to
greenfield
would
he
please
just
for
a
little
while
take
her
home
to
greenfield
chapter

a
ride
in
the
rain
tears
almost
hysterics
from
the
woman
who
for
seven
years
had
been
the
quiet
cheerful
little
wife
humming
to
herself
while
she
did
the
housework
it
was
more
than
startling
it
was
terrifying
ford
realized
then
probably
for
the
first
time
how
much
the
making
of
the
automobile
had
cost
her
he
quieted
her
as
well
as
he
could
and
promised
that
he
would
take
her
back
to
greenfield
he
would
give
up
his
job
at
the
edison
plant
and
move
to
the
farm
to
live
since
she
cared
so
much
about
it
he
said
his
work
on
the
machine
could
wait
he
took
her
into
the
house
and
made
her
a
cup
of
hot
tea
when
she
was
sitting
comfortably
warming
her
feet
at
the
heating
stove
and
sipping
the
tea
he
said
he
would
just
run
out
and
fasten
the
shed
door
for
the
night
the
machine
was
almost
finished
a
few
more
screws
a
tightening
of
the
leather
belt
the
placing
of
the
steering
lever
and
it
would
be
complete
he
had
spent
four
years
of
hard
work
and
harder
thought
on
its
building
delayed
first
by
his
poverty
then
by
the
building
of
the
house
and
always
held
back
for
twelve
hours
out
of
every
day
by
his
work
at
the
edison
plant
now
he
would
have
to
put
it
aside
again
to
spend
precious
days
and
weeks
disposing
of
his
equity
in
the
house
moving
settling
in
greenfield
struggling
with
new
hired
men
beginning
again
the
grind
of
managing
a
farm
it
was
only
another
delay
he
said
doggedly
to
himself
he
would
make
the
machine
run
yet
in
the
meantime
he
could
not
resist
taking
up
his
tools
and
working
on
it
just
a
minute
or
so
the
engine
was
in
place
the
gears
adjusted
he
tightened
the
leather
belt
and
tested
the
pulley
again
then
he
set
the
rear
axle
on
blocks
of
wood
lifting
the
wheels
from
the
ground
and
started
the
engine
the
cough
of
the
cylinder
quickened
into
a
staccato
bark
the
flywheel
blurred
with
speed
then
ford
tightened
the
pulley
the
broad
leather
belt
took
hold
the
rear
wheels
spun
she
was
running
it
remained
only
to
test
the
machine
in
actual
going
on
the
ground
ford
went
to
work
on
the
steering
gear
he
had
thought
it
all
out
before
he
had
made
all
the
parts
now
he
must
put
them
together
fit
them
into
place
and
test
them
he
forgot
about
his
wife
waiting
in
the
house
he
did
not
notice
that
the
fire
in
the
stove
was
getting
low
and
the
hour
was
growing
late
he
bent
every
thought
and
energy
to
placing
the
steering
gear
at
midnight
he
was
still
working
at
he
had
the
front
wheels
blocked
up
and
was
testing
the
steering
lever
it
needed
some
changes
at
they
were
finished
he
started
the
engine
again
and
it
missed
fire
something
was
wrong
with
the
spark
at
grimy
absorbed
he
was
hard
at
work
when
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
heard
his
wife
say
henry
my
dear
what
the
matter
i
coming
in
right
away
why
you
all
wet
he
exclaimed
seeing
her
dripping
shawl
it
raining
hard
did
you
know
it
she
said
you
should
have
come
out
i
thought
you
were
going
right
to
bed
he
answered
well
i
could
sleep
very
well
i
got
to
thinking
henry
we
go
back
to
the
farm
it
was
just
a
notion
of
mine
i
guess
i
was
tired
or
something
i
changed
my
mind
we
better
stay
right
here
till
you
get
the
machine
finished
he
laughed
well
little
woman
i
guess
that
wo
be
so
very
long
it
finished
right
now
he
said
you
wait
a
minute
and
you
see
me
running
it
she
stood
and
watched
more
excited
than
he
while
he
started
the
engine
again
nailed
a
couple
of
old
boards
together
for
a
seat
and
opened
wide
the
shed
doors
the
rain
was
falling
in
torrents
and
underfoot
the
light
snow
had
turned
to
thin
slush
on
the
frozen
ground
it
was
very
dark
he
pushed
the
machine
into
the
yard
and
hung
a
lantern
over
the
dashboard
for
a
headlight
inside
the
shed
ford
in
a
voice
shaking
with
excitement
begged
him
to
wait
until
morning
but
he
did
not
listen
the
engine
and
steering
gear
were
protected
from
the
rain
and
no
discomfort
could
have
equaled
for
him
the
disappointment
of
another
delay
the
time
had
come
when
he
could
prove
his
theories
he
would
not
waste
one
minute
of
it
the
engine
was
already
running
he
stepped
into
the
car
sat
down
and
slowly
carefully
tightened
the
pulley
then
in
the
first
ford
automobile
he
rode
away
from
the
old
shed
when
he
felt
the
machine
moving
under
him
he
tightened
his
grasp
on
the
steering
lever
suddenly
the
light
of
the
lantern
showed
him
a
dozen
things
he
had
never
noticed
in
the
yard
before
the
loomed
menacingly
before
him
a
pile
of
flower
pots
seemed
to
grow
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
ordinary
size
the
machine
wobbled
unsteadily
while
he
desperately
struggled
to
drive
it
in
a
straight
line
he
turned
it
from
the
flower
pots
jerked
it
back
in
time
to
avoid
running
into
the
fence
and
headed
straight
for
the
it
seemed
to
jump
at
him
at
the
last
minute
he
thought
of
the
pulley
he
loosened
the
leather
belt
the
engine
spun
wildly
the
car
stopped
henry
ford
got
out
breathing
hard
and
pushed
the
machine
around
the
you
see
i
not
only
had
to
make
the
machine
but
i
had
to
get
into
it
and
learn
how
to
steer
it
while
it
was
running
he
says
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
like
a
good
wide
space
for
the
job
after
he
had
rescued
the
machine
from
the
he
turned
it
toward
the
street
away
he
passed
the
house
drove
over
the
gravel
sidewalk
and
turned
down
edison
avenue
the
scattered
houses
were
dark
and
silent
every
one
was
asleep
the
little
machine
rattling
and
coughing
proceeded
through
the
thin
slush
in
jerks
and
jumps
doing
valiantly
with
its
one
cylinder
perched
on
the
rough
board
seat
henry
ford
battled
with
the
steering
lever
while
on
the
sidewalk
ford
wrapped
in
her
shawl
anxiously
kept
pace
with
them
it
was
not
difficult
to
do
for
the
car
was
not
breaking
any
future
speed
limits
at
the
end
of
the
first
block
ford
turned
the
car
successfully
and
rode
down
the
side
street
widely
from
side
to
side
in
his
effort
to
drive
straight
ahead
fortunately
detroit
streets
are
wide
when
he
had
passed
the
second
block
he
began
to
wonder
how
to
turn
and
drive
back
at
the
end
of
the
third
block
he
solved
the
difficulty
he
stopped
the
car
jumped
out
lifted
it
around
and
headed
it
for
home
by
this
time
the
engine
was
missing
again
but
it
continued
gallantly
to
jerk
and
push
the
light
car
forward
until
ford
had
reached
his
own
yard
then
he
stopped
it
pushed
the
machine
into
the
shed
and
turned
to
ford
well
it
runs
all
right
guess
i
have
some
breakfast
and
go
to
bed
he
said
and
ford
hurried
in
to
make
coffee
how
did
i
feel
why
i
felt
tired
he
explains
now
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
all
next
day
i
knew
my
real
work
with
the
car
had
just
begun
i
had
to
get
capital
somehow
start
a
factory
get
people
interested
everything
besides
i
saw
a
chance
for
a
lot
of
improvements
in
that

probably
the
disposition
to
rest
on
our
laurels
is
more
than
anything
else
responsible
for
the
mediocrity
of
the
individual
and
the
slow
progress
of
the
race
having
accomplished
something
most
of
us
spend
some
time
in
admiring
it
and
ourselves
it
is
characteristic
of
big
men
that
past
achievements
do
not
hold
their
interest
they
are
concerned
only
with
their
efforts
to
accomplish
still
more
in
the
future
henry
ford
had
built
an
automobile
his
four
years
work
had
been
successful
and
that
little
machine
scarcely
larger
than
a
bicycle
with
its
puffing
little
engine
and
crude
steering
apparatus
stood
for
an
epoch
in
human
progress
he
might
be
pardoned
if
he
had
spent
a
month
or
two
in
in
driving
the
car
up
and
down
detroit
streets
and
enjoying
the
comments
of
the
men
who
had
laughed
at
him
so
long
but
apparently
it
did
not
occur
to
him
he
saw
already
a
number
of
possible
improvements
in
the
little
machine
he
was
as
indifferent
to
the
praise
of
other
men
as
he
had
been
to
their
ridicule
after
that
one
day
of
rest
he
resumed
almost
the
old
routine
when
a
few
men
at
the
edison
plant
laughingly
inquired
how
he
was
getting
along
with
the
great
invention
he
remarked
quietly
that
the
machine
was
running
he
had
been
riding
in
it
already
then
at
he
hurried
home
and
out
to
the
shed
for
the
usual
evening
work
he
was
trying
to
plan
an
engine
which
would
give
more
power
incidentally
in
his
odd
moments
he
was
working
to
improve
the
steering
apparatus
one
imagines
the
incredulity
the
amazement
that
followed
his
quiet
statement
that
the
thing
was
actually
running
the
men
at
the
plant
began
to
drop
around
at
the
ford
place
to
look
at
it
they
came
doubtfully
prepared
either
to
laugh
or
to
be
convinced
after
they
had
examined
the
engine
and
looked
over
the
transmission
and
steering
gear
they
went
away
still
hesitating
between
two
conclusions
it
works
all
right
they
said
there
no
question
the
blamed
thing
runs
how
do
you
suppose
he
ever
happened
to
stumble
onto
the
idea
but
where
he
going
to
get
the
capital
to
manufacture
it
after
all
there
wo
be
much
of
a
market
a
few
rich
fellows
buy
it
probably
for
the
novelty
after
all
you
ca
make
a
machine
that
will
do
the
work
of
horses
to
any
great
extent
some
of
them
took
a
different
view
they
became
enthusiastic
my
lord
ford
there
millions
in
this
thing
millions
they
said
you
ought
to
get
out
and
organize
a
company
a
big
company
incorporate
and
sell
stock
and
make
a
right
away
and
then
build
a
machine
like
a
phaeton
with
big
leather
cushions
and
carriage
lamps
and
a
lot
of
enamel
finish
why
there
are
hundreds
of
men
that
could
afford
to
pay
two
or
three
thousand
dollars
for
one
of
you
could
make
a
hundred
per
cent
profit
two
hundred
per
cent
ford
listened
to
all
of
them
and
said
little
he
was
busy
improving
the
machine
it
did
not
suit
him
yet
he
felt
he
could
make
it
much
more
powerful
and
efficient
with
a
little
more
work
meantime
he
revolved
in
his
mind
plans
for
putting
it
on
the
market
those
plans
included
always
one
fundamental
point
he
was
resolved
to
make
the
automobile
cheap
i
got
a
machine
here
that
saves
time
and
work
and
money
he
said
the
more
people
who
have
it
the
more
it
will
save
there
no
object
in
building
it
so
only
a
few
rich
men
can
own
one
it
is
the
rich
men
who
need
it
it
the
common
folks
like
me
news
of
the
amazing
machine
to
be
seen
in
the
old
shed
behind
the
little
house
on
edison
street
spread
rapidly
about
this
time
news
dispatches
carried
word
of
two
other
automobiles
built
in
this
country
a
man
named
duryea
of
springfield
and
another
named
haynes
in
kokomo
had
been
working
on
the
same
idea
a
reporter
found
ford
at
work
on
his
engine
interviewed
him
and
wrote
a
story
for
a
detroit
paper
one
or
two
wealthy
men
hunted
ford
up
and
talked
about
furnishing
the
capital
to
manufacture
the
machine
they
saw
as
some
of
ford
friends
had
done
an
opportunity
to
float
a
big
company
sell
stock
and
build
a
car
ford
considered
these
offers
for
a
time
building
an
automobile
had
been
only
half
of
his
idea
building
it
cheap
had
been
the
other
half
and
he
would
not
abandon
it
he
figured
it
out
in
dollars
and
cents
two
hundred
per
cent
on
a
small
quantity
of
cars
or
a
smaller
profit
on
a
larger
quantity
he
showed
that
the
most
sound
basis
for
the
company
was
the
manufacture
of
a
large
number
of
machines
at
a
profit
sufficient
merely
to
keep
enlarging
the
plant
and
building
more
machines
the
idea
did
not
appeal
to
the
men
who
were
eager
for
large
immediate
profits
for
themselves
in
the
end
the
men
with
money
dropped
the
matter
ford
was
obstinate
but
he
was
a
small
man
with
no
capital
merely
a
crank
who
had
hit
by
accident
on
a
good
idea
he
would
come
around
all
right
in
time
they
concluded
ford
continued
to
work
at
the
edison
plant
and
spend
his
evenings
trying
to
improve
his
machine
he
had
taken
ford
to
greenfield
where
she
would
stay
with
her
mother
until
the
baby
was
born
after
that
one
hysterical
outburst
on
the
night
the
automobile
was
finished
she
had
returned
to
her
cheerful
acceptance
of
his
interest
in
the
car
indeed
she
herself
had
become
enthusiastic
about
its
possibilities
you
stay
right
here
and
keep
your
job
with
the
edison
people
she
said
i
be
perfectly
all
right
with
mother
and
maybe
by
the
time
i
come
back
you
have
a
company
organized
and
a
whole
factory
going
who
knows
only
mind
you
do
work
too
late
at
night
and
promise
eat
your
meals
regular
ford
promised
but
when
he
returned
to
the
dark
little
house
at
night
and
faced
the
task
of
building
a
fire
and
cooking
supper
for
himself
it
seemed
to
him
a
bigger
job
than
building
the
automobile
had
been
he
heated
some
coffee
on
the
gasoline
stove
burned
some
bread
into
a
semblance
of
toast
and
scrambled
a
few
eggs
then
he
spread
a
newspaper
on
the
kitchen
table
set
the
on
it
and
managed
to
make
a
meal
naturally
about
midnight
he
grew
hungry
he
came
into
the
kitchen
looked
at
the
cold
greasy
still
setting
on
the
kitchen
table
remembered
that
he
was
out
of
bread
and
thought
of
an
lunch
wagon
that
stood
near
substation
a
where
sometimes
he
bought
a
cup
of
coffee
when
he
was
working
there
the
automobile
stood
waiting
in
the
shed
he
told
himself
that
he
wanted
to
test
the
steering
gear
again
anyway
he
went
out
started
the
engine
climbed
in
and
away
through
the
silent
deserted
streets
to
the
lunch
wagon
coffee
jim
loafing
among
his
pans
and
mounds
of
hamburg
steak
was
astonished
to
see
the
queer
little
machine
jerking
and
coughing
its
way
toward
him
he
remembered
ford
and
while
he
sliced
the
onions
and
cut
the
bread
for
ford
midnight
luncheon
they
talked
about
the
automobile
afterward
coffee
jim
examined
it
in
detail
and
marveled
when
ford
took
him
for
a
little
ride
in
it
he
became
enthusiastic
soon
it
was
part
of
ford
routine
to
drive
the
little
car
to
the
lunch
wagon
at
midnight
have
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
hot
sandwich
and
a
chat
with
coffee
jim
they
became
friends
it
was
one
of
those
accidental
relationships
which
have
great
consequences
a
hundred
thousand
ford
automobiles
owe
their
existence
largely
to
that
chance
friendship
between
ford
and
coffee
jim
chapter
xvii
another
eight
years
if
ford
had
been
unduly
elated
over
his
success
in
making
an
automobile
the
years
that
followed
that
night
ride
in
the
rain
would
have
been
one
succession
of
disappointments
men
with
money
enough
to
build
a
factory
were
not
seeking
business
ventures
in
the
nineties
money
was
scarce
and
growing
more
so
the
few
financiers
who
might
have
taken
up
ford
invention
floated
a
big
issue
of
common
stock
and
sold
the
cars
at
a
profit
of
two
or
three
hundred
per
cent
saw
no
advantage
in
furnishing
the
capital
to
start
a
small
plant
on
ford
plan
he
himself
was
close
pressed
for
money
payments
on
the
little
house
with
their
interest
the
cost
of
his
wife
illness
and
of
providing
for
the
new
baby
his
own
living
expenses
took
the
greater
part
of
his
salary
the
situation
would
have
been
disheartening
to
most
men
ford
set
his
teeth
and
kept
on
working
the
engine
bothered
him
it
did
not
give
him
the
power
he
wanted
after
he
had
worked
with
it
for
a
time
he
took
it
down
cut
another
section
from
the
piece
of
pipe
and
made
another
cylinder
the
result
was
somewhat
better
but
still
the
little
car
jerked
along
over
the
ground
and
did
not
satisfy
him
he
fell
back
into
the
old
routine
twelve
hours
at
the
edison
plant
home
to
supper
and
out
to
the
shed
to
work
the
evening
through
on
the
machine
ford
was
in
charge
of
the
house
again
busy
keeping
it
neat
and
bright
nursing
the
baby
making
his
little
dresses
washing
and
ironing
keeping
down
the
grocer
bills
meantime
other
men
with
machines
no
better
than
ford
were
starting
factories
and
manufacturing
automobiles
once
in
a
while
on
his
way
home
from
work
ford
saw
one
on
the
street
a
horseless
carriage
shining
with
black
enamel
upholstered
with
deep
leather
cushions
ornamented
with
elaborate
brass
carriage
lamps
usually
they
were
driven
by
steam
engines
they
were
a
curiosity
in
detroit
streets
a
luxury
which
only
the
very
rich
might
afford
crowds
gathered
to
look
at
them
ford
must
have
seen
them
with
some
bitterness
but
apparently
he
was
not
greatly
discouraged
i
did
worry
much
i
knew
i
could
put
my
idea
through
somehow
he
says
i
tell
you
no
matter
how
things
may
look
any
project
founded
on
the
idea
of
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number
will
win
in
the
end
it
bound
to
he
went
home
ate
the
supper
ford
had
waiting
and
doggedly
resumed
work
in
the
old
shed
the
chronicle
of
those
years
from
the
standpoint
of
an
onlooker
would
be
merely
a
wearisome
record
of
the
machine
shop
a
detailed
record
of
pistons
number
of
revolutions
per
minute
experiments
in
only
the
knowledge
of
their
result
or
ford
own
story
of
his
hopes
disappointments
mental
struggles
would
make
them
interesting
that
part
of
his
story
ford
will
not
dwell
upon
i
kept
on
working
another
eight
years
he
says
quietly
eight
years
some
time
during
them
he
saw
what
was
needed
heretofore
the
crank
shaft
had
made
a
complete
revolution
on
a
single
power
impulse
ford
perceived
that
two
impulses
properly
placed
would
increase
both
the
power
and
the
smoothness
of
the
running
the
result
of
that
quiet
eight
years
work
was
the
first
practical
opposed
engine
mounted
on
a
motor
car
in
the
little
shed
working
alone
through
the
long
evenings
while
his
neighbors
rested
and
visited
on
their
front
porches
and
his
wife
sang
the
baby
to
sleep
in
the
house
he
built
the
engine
that
made
the
gasoline
automobile
a
possibility
in
the
spring
of
he
finished
it
mounted
it
on
the
old
car
which
he
had
made
nine
years
before
of
discarded
bicycle
wheels
and
rough
boards
and
drove
it
out
of
the
shed
it
was
nearly
midnight
of
a
quiet
spring
night
the
lights
in
houses
had
gone
out
long
before
in
his
own
home
ford
and
the
boy
were
sleeping
soundly
ford
turned
the
car
down
edison
avenue
and
put
on
full
power
the
engine
responded
beautifully
the
car
raced
down
the
avenue
under
the
branches
of
the
trees
whose
buds
were
swelling
with
spring
sap
while
the
wind
lifted
ford
hair
and
blew
hard
against
his
face
it
was
pleasant
after
the
long
hours
in
the
shed
the
steady
throb
of
the
motor
the
car
even
progress
were
delightful
by
george
i
just
ride
down
and
show
this
to
coffee
jim
said
ford
his
circle
of
acquaintances
in
detroit
was
small
his
long
hours
of
work
prevented
his
cultivating
them
at
the
edison
plant
his
pleasant
but
rather
retiring
manner
had
won
only
a
casual
friendliness
from
the
men
this
friendliness
that
had
grown
since
his
success
with
the
motor
had
replaced
their
derision
with
respect
but
still
it
was
far
from
intimate
companionship
he
knew
no
one
with
money
he
was
still
a
poor
man
working
for
wages
with
only
his
brain
and
hands
for
equipment
nearly
thirteen
years
of
hard
work
had
produced
his
motor
car
but
he
had
very
little
money
and
no
financial
backing
for
its
manufacture
his
closest
friend
was
coffee
jim
coffee
jim
examined
the
car
with
interest
that
night
he
left
his
lunch
wagon
and
took
a
short
ride
in
it
he
listened
while
ford
explained
its
mechanical
principle
you
got
a
winner
there
all
right
he
said
heartily
all
you
need
is
capital
ford
agreed
with
him
he
had
been
revolving
in
his
mind
plans
for
getting
it
when
he
left
coffee
jim
at
his
lunch
wagon
and
rode
slowly
home
he
continued
to
think
about
it
that
morning
he
drove
to
the
edison
plant
in
the
car
and
on
his
way
home
at
night
he
made
a
detour
through
detroit
principal
streets
he
wanted
people
to
talk
about
the
car
and
they
did
every
one
in
detroit
heard
more
or
less
about
it
in
the
months
that
followed
meantime
ford
took
a
few
days
leave
from
the
edison
plant
now
and
then
and
personally
made
efforts
to
interest
financiers
in
its
manufacture
he
interviewed
his
banker
and
most
of
the
big
business
men
of
the
city
outlined
his
plan
for
a
factory
demonstrated
the
car
every
one
showed
some
interest
but
ford
did
not
get
the
money
late
that
fall
he
discussed
the
situation
with
coffee
jim
one
night
i
got
the
car
and
i
got
the
right
idea
he
said
it
bound
to
win
in
time
the
trouble
is
these
men
ca
get
an
idea
until
they
see
it
worked
out
with
their
own
eyes
what
i
need
is
some
spectacular
exhibition
of
the
car
if
i
could
enter
her
in
the
races
next
year
stand
a
chance
to
win
over
anything
there
be
in
the
field
then
these
men
would
fall
over
themselves
to
back
me
well
ca
you
do
it
coffee
jim
inquired
ford
shook
his
head
cost
too
much
he
said
i
laid
off
work
a
lot
this
summer
trying
to
get
capital
and
the
boy
been
sick
i
have
to
buy
a
new
car
for
the
racing
i
might
rake
up
money
enough
for
material
but
i
make
the
car
in
time
working
evenings
and
i
ca
afford
to
give
up
my
job
and
spend
my
whole
time
on
it
chapter
xviii
winning
a
race
coffee
jim
pondered
the
situation
he
knew
ford
thoroughly
he
believed
in
the
car
to
win
the
grosse
point
races
would
give
ford
his
chance
a
chance
he
was
missing
for
lack
of
money
coffee
jim
thought
of
his
own
bank
account
which
had
been
growing
for
years
nickel
by
nickel
dime
by
dime
from
the
profits
on
sandwiches
and
hamburger
and
onions
see
here
ford
he
said
suddenly
i
take
a
chance
i
back
you
you
go
on
quit
your
job
build
that
car
and
race
her
i
put
up
the
money
ford
accepted
the
offer
without
hesitation
he
believed
in
the
car
coffee
jim
waved
aside
ford
suggestion
of
securing
the
loan
by
his
personal
note
or
by
a
mortgage
on
the
little
house
take
the
money
that
all
right
pay
it
back
when
you
can
your
good
enough
for
me
he
said
he
believed
in
ford
it
was
a
demonstration
of
the
practical
value
of
friendship
a
pure
sentiment
which
had
come
unexpectedly
to
the
rescue
when
all
material
means
had
failed
hard
work
real
ability
business
sagacity
had
been
unable
to
give
ford
the
start
which
his
friendship
with
the
owner
of
the
little
lunch
wagon
had
brought
him
it
was
one
of
those
experiences
which
helped
to
form
ford
business
philosophy
that
philosophy
which
sounds
so
impractical
and
has
proved
so
successful
any
man
who
considers
everything
from
the
standpoint
of
the
most
good
to
the
most
people
will
never
want
for
anything
he
says
no
i
mean
mental
influence
or
psychic
attraction
or
anything
like
that
i
mean
plain
common
sense
that
the
attitude
that
makes
friends
all
kinds
of
friends
everywhere
some
that
you
never
even
hear
about
and
friends
bring
all
the
rest
he
took
coffee
jim
money
gave
up
his
job
at
the
edison
plant
and
went
to
work
on
the
little
racer
it
seemed
pretty
good
to
be
able
to
work
all
day
on
the
car
as
well
as
the
evenings
he
says
he
took
down
the
engine
and
entirely
rebuilt
it
substituting
the
best
of
material
for
the
makeshifts
he
had
been
obliged
to
use
he
spent
long
hours
designing
a
racing
body
figuring
out
problems
of
and
weight
eight
months
of
careful
thought
and
work
went
into
that
car
at
last
in
the
early
summer
of
it
was
finished
at
one
morning
business
being
over
at
the
lunch
wagon
he
and
coffee
jim
took
it
out
for
a
trial
it
ran
like
the
wind
down
the
quiet
vacant
streets
of
detroit
in
the
gray
chill
of
early
morning
they
raced
at
a
speed
that
made
the
houses
on
either
side
blur
into
a
gray
haze
coffee
jim
clung
breathlessly
to
the
mechanic
seat
while
ford
bent
over
the
steering
lever
and
gave
her
more
power
and
still
more
power
holy
moses
she
sure
does
run
coffee
jim
gasped
when
the
car
slowed
down
smoothly
and
stopped
you
win
that
race
sure
as
shooting
yes
she
a
good
little
car
ford
said
looking
it
over
critically
she
a
pretty
good
little
car
he
stood
looking
at
it
his
hands
in
his
pockets
i
got
an
idea
for
a
motor
that
will
beat
her
though
he
said
it
too
late
to
build
it
now
we
have
to
put
this
one
in
the
race
but
i
make
a
car
yet
that
beat
this
as
much
as
this
beats
a
bicycle
it
was
not
a
boast
it
was
a
simple
statement
of
fact
the
little
racer
was
finished
thoroughly
well
done
he
spent
no
more
thought
on
it
already
his
mind
was
reaching
ahead
planning
a
better
one
it
may
be
imagined
with
what
anxiety
the
fords
awaited
the
day
of
the
races
ford
was
to
be
his
own
driver
and
ford
dread
of
losing
the
race
was
mixed
with
fear
for
his
safety
if
there
should
be
an
accident
she
had
seen
the
car
in
the
tryout
and
its
speed
terrified
her
though
ford
assured
her
with
masculine
clumsiness
that
even
greater
speed
had
been
made
in
previous
races
alexander
winton
of
cleveland
then
the
track
champion
of
the
country
had
beaten
it
more
than
once
on
the
racetrack
ford
said
he
was
confident
he
could
do
better
later
there
was
a
quiet
tryout
on
the
racetrack
that
showed
ford
he
was
right
though
he
kept
secret
the
exact
time
he
had
made
on
the
day
of
the
races
enormous
crowds
gathered
at
the
grosse
point
tracks
it
was
the
first
automobile
track
meeting
ever
held
in
michigan
and
excitement
ran
high
alexander
winton
was
there
confident
and
smiling
in
his
car
which
had
broken
so
many
records
the
crowds
cheered
him
wildly
ford
quiet
and
perhaps
a
little
white
with
the
tension
drove
his
car
out
on
the
tracks
was
greeted
with
a
few
uncertain
cheers
who
that
people
said
oh
that
a
detroit
man
let
see
what
is
his
name
ford
never
heard
of
him
before
funny
little
car
is
it
maybe
he
been
put
in
to
fill
out
he
the
only
man
against
winton
in
the
they
could
get
a
real
car
to
race
winton
hi
there
cooper
cooper

the
crowd
got
to
its
feet
and
cheered
tom

champion
who
strolled
on
to
the
field
and
chatted
with
winton
ford
was
outside
it
all
he
had
been
too
busy
working
on
his
car
had
had
too
little
money
to
be
on
intimate
terms
with
the
big
men
of
the
automobile
business
or
to
become
friendly
with
champions
one
supposes
he
wasted
no
regrets
on
the
situation
he
had
his
car
the
concrete
form
of
his
mechanical
ideas
the
time
had
come
to
test
their
value
if
they
were
right
he
would
win
the
race
if
they
were
wrong
he
would
go
back
to
his
shed
and
work
out
better
ones
he
examined
the
car
again
looked
to
the
gasoline
and
oil
and
was
ready
coffee
jim
slapping
him
on
the
shoulder
said
all
right
ford
go
to
it
and
hurried
up
to
his
seat
in
the
grandstand
where
ford
and
the
boy
were
already
sitting
tense
with
excitement
and
apprehension
winton
waved
his
cap
in
a
last
response
to
the
roar
from
the
crowd
pulled
it
down
tight
and
settled
back
into
his
seat
the
signal
came
ford
bending
over
his
steering
lever
threw
on
the
power
and
felt
the
car
jump
forward
the
race
was
on
it
happened
thirteen
years
ago
but
there
are
still
people
in
detroit
who
talk
of
that
race
they
describe
the
start
the
enthusiasm
for
winton
the
surprise
of
the
crowd
when
the
little
car
driven
by
nobody
knew
whom
hung
on
grimly
just
behind
the
champion
to
the
end
of
the
first
stretch
through
the
second
stretch
well
on
to
the
third
winton
car
shot
ahead
then
the
crowd
cheered
him
madly
then
the
roar
died
down
in
amazement
the
little
car
with
a
burst
of
speed
overtook
the
champion
and
the
two
cars
shot
past
the
grandstand
side
by
side
and
sped
into
the
second
lap
into
the
silence
came
a
yell
from
coffee
jim
ford
yah
ford
go
it
go
it
go
it
ford
the
crowd
went
crazy
no
one
knew
clearly
what
was
happening
ford
ford
winton
he
ahead
go
it
go
it
winton
come
on
come
on
look
at
look
at
ford
they
yelled
then
the
two
cars
swept
into
the
final
stretch
abreast
the
crowd
wild
with
excitement
hoarse
disheveled
was
standing
on
the
seats
roaring
come
on
come
on
come
on
ford
ford
every
detail
of
that
race
must
still
be
distinct
in
ford
mind
but
he
sums
them
all
in
one
concise
sentence
it
was
some
race
i
won
it
chapter
xix
raising
capital
ford
sat
in
his
little
car
white
shaken
dusty
the
track
champion
of
this
country
he
was
surrounded
by
a
small
crowd
of
automobile
enthusiasts
promoters
bicycle
champions
all
eager
to
meet
and
talk
with
the
unknown
man
who
had
taken
the
honors
away
from
winton
among
them
was
tom
cooper
grasping
ford
hand
he
looked
with
interest
at
the
slightly
built
man
who
had
won
the
race
and
said
bully
work
the
way
you
handled
her
on
that
last
turn
whose
car
is
it
mine
said
ford
i
mean
cooper
looked
at
the
lines
of
the
car
i
mean
whose
engine
did
you
use
it
my
engine
i
made
it
ford
replied
the
deuce
you
did
cooper
exclaimed
well
i
must
say
you
did
a
good
job
i
like
to
look
it
over
some
time
sure
come
out
to
my
house
any
time
glad
to
show
it
to
you
said
ford
cordially
it
was
the
beginning
of
an
association
which
was
to
be
highly
profitable
to
both
of
them
other
men
of
national
prominence
in
the
world
of
sports
greeted
ford
enthusiastically
as
one
of
themselves
while
the
crowd
in
the
grandstand
still
cheered
spasmodically
reporters
hurried
up
with
camera
men
and
ford
stepped
back
into
the
little
car
and
posed
somewhat
sheepishly
for
his
first
newspaper
pictures
men
who
had
formerly
passed
him
on
the
street
with
a
careless
nod
now
stopped
him
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
talked
like
old
friends
he
was
beyond
question
the
hero
of
the
day
he
took
it
all
in
a
manner
his
car
had
done
no
more
than
he
had
expected
all
along
and
it
was
the
car
not
himself
which
filled
his
mind
he
hoped
that
the
publicity
would
bring
him
the
necessary
capital
to
start
his
factory
within
a
week
he
received
offers
from
wealthy
men
of
detroit
the
local
papers
had
printed
pictures
of
ford
his
car
and
the
old
shed
where
it
had
been
built
with
long
accounts
of
his
years
of
work
and
his
efforts
to
organize
a
company
detroit
had
been
awakened
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
real
opportunity
for
men
with
vision
and
sufficient
capital
to
carry
it
out
but
without
exception
these
men
insisted
on
one
thing
absolute
control
of
the
company
to
be
organized
from
their
standpoint
that
proviso
was
reasonable
enough
if
they
furnished
the
money
and
ford
merely
the
idea
of
course
they
should
keep
not
only
the
larger
share
of
the
profits
but
entire
control
of
the
venture
as
well
without
their
money
they
argued
his
idea
was
valueless
on
the
other
hand
in
spite
of
his
eight
years
of
struggle
for
lack
of
capital
ford
still
maintained
that
the
idea
was
the
really
valuable
part
of
the
combination
he
insisted
on
controlling
the
organization
which
was
to
manufacture
his
cars
while
he
had
been
working
alone
in
the
little
shed
at
night
he
had
thought
out
his
plan
for
a
factory
mentally
picturing
its
methods
its
organization
the
handling
of
material
from
the
raw
iron
to
the
finished
cars
fully
assembled
rolling
away
in
an
endless
line
he
had
figured
costs
to
the
fraction
of
a
cent
planned
methods
of
arranging
the
work
standardizing
the
product
eliminating
waste
and
friction
at
every
possible
point
now
that
the
car
was
finished
the
factory
plan
took
its
place
in
his
mind
he
did
not
intend
to
abandon
it
until
he
had
made
it
a
reality
he
was
going
to
build
that
factory
as
he
had
built
his
engine
in
spite
of
any
obstacles
or
opposition
to
do
it
he
must
control
the
policies
it
was
a
deadlock
to
the
man
with
money
it
seemed
sheer
insanity
to
put
control
of
a
business
venture
into
the
hands
of
an
obstinate
mechanic
who
had
happened
to
hit
on
an
idea
for
an
automobile
engine
ford
would
not
dispose
of
his
patents
on
any
other
condition
in
a
short
time
the
discussions
were
dropped
and
he
was
where
he
had
been
before
the
track
meeting
that
spectacular
race
however
had
brought
him
many
acquaintances
and
many
of
them
developed
into
close
friends
james
couzens
a
small
hardware
merchant
of
detroit
was
one
of
them
and
wills
a
mechanical
draughtsman
was
another
with
tom
cooper
the
bicycle
champion
they
spent
many
evenings
in
the
old
shed
or
on
the
front
steps
of
the
ford
house
discussing
projects
for
the
ford
factory
couzens
who
had
a
talent
for
business
affairs
formed
a
plan
for
interesting
a
small
group
of
other
merchants
like
himself
and
financing
ford
he
brought
negotiations
to
a
certain
point
and
found
himself
confronted
again
by
their
demand
for
control
of
the
company
we
must
do
something
that
show
them
that
they
got
to
have
you
on
your
own
terms
something
big
startling
to
stir
them
up
he
reported
how
about
winning
another
race
cooper
suggested
they
pulling
one
off
in
ohio
this
fall
no
it
must
be
right
here
so
i
can
take
my
men
out
and
let
them
see
it
couzens
objected
it
takes
a
lot
to
jar
any
money
loose
from
those
fellows
i
could
enter
at
the
grosse
point
tracks
next
spring
ford
said
but
it
would
show
them
any
more
than
they
already
seen
if
i
race
the
same
car
i
ca
afford
to
build
another
one
he
was
still
in
debt
to
coffee
jim
for
the
cost
of
his
first
racer
coffee
jim
professing
himself
satisfied
with
the
results
of
the
race
doubtless
he
had
judiciously
placed
some
bets
on
it
had
left
detroit
in
the
meantime
but
ford
nevertheless
counted
the
loan
among
his
liabilities
think
you
can
beat
that
car
cooper
inquired
i
know
i
can
ford
replied
quietly
then
you
go
to
it
and
build
her
i
back
the
scheme
cooper
said
it
was
another
debt
on
ford
shoulders
but
he
accepted
it
and
immediately
began
to
work
on
another
racer
with
the
intention
of
startling
couzens
group
of
sedate
business
men
he
obeyed
injunction
to
build
her
big
the
roof
the
limit
the
result
was
certainly
startling
four
enormous
cylinders
gave
that
engine
eighty
horsepower
when
it
was
finished
and
cooper
and
ford
took
it
out
one
night
for
a
trial
people
started
from
their
sleep
for
blocks
about
the
ford
house
the
noise
of
the
engine
could
be
heard
miles
flames
flashed
from
the
motor
in
the
massive
framework
was
one
seat
cooper
stood
thunderstruck
while
ford
got
in
and
grasped
the
tiller
good
lord
how
fast
do
you
figure
she
do
he
asked
do
know
ford
replied
he
put
on
the
power
there
was
a
mighty
roar
a
burst
of
flame
and
cooper
stood
alone
on
the
curb
far
down
the
street
he
saw
the
car
thundering
away
a
few
minutes
later
it
came
roaring
back
and
stopped
ford
sat
in
it
white
how
far
did
you
go
cooper
asked
ford
told
him
do
you
mean
to
say
she
makes
a
speed
like
that
cooper
ejaculated
aghast
she
make
better
than
that
i
did
dare
to
give
her
full
power
ford
replied
he
climbed
out
and
stood
beside
cooper
and
the
two
looked
at
the
car
in
awe
see
here
i
hope
you
do
think
i
drive
that
thing
in
the
races
cooper
said
after
a
time
i
would
do
it
for
a
gold
mine
you
have
to
do
it
i
should
say
not
ford
retorted
i
wo
take
the
responsibility
of
driving
her
at
full
speed
to
win
every
race
that
was
ever
run
cooper
if
that
car
ever
gets
really
started
it
will
kill
somebody
sure
chapter
xx
clinging
to
a
principle
ford
and
cooper
regarded
the
juggernaut
car
for
some
time
in
meditative
silence
well
i
guess
you
built
a
real
racer
there
all
right
cooper
said
admiringly
yes
it
looks
as
if
i
had
ford
answered
the
question
is
what
good
is
it
is
there
a
man
on
earth
who
try
to
drive
it
well
i
got
some
nerve
myself
and
i
do
want
to
cooper
admitted
he
walked
around
the
car
and
then
looked
again
at
the
engine
how
fast
would
the
darn
thing
go
i
wonder
he
said
get
in
and
try
her
ford
suggested
cooper
climbed
in
ford
cranked
the
engine
and
again
sleeping
detroit
jumped
from
its
bed
the
car
leaped
and
shot
down
the
avenue
when
it
roared
back
again
cooper
stopped
it
in
the
middle
of
the
street
that
settles
it
for
me
he
said
she
must
have
made
forty
miles
an
hour
and
she
was
half
running
at
that
i
wo
take
her
out
on
the
track
they
confronted
the
situation
gloomily
couzens
was
depending
on
the
success
of
the
car
at
the
races
to
bring
his
men
in
line
for
the
organization
of
a
company
here
was
the
car
built
at
the
cost
of
months
of
work
and
some
hundreds
of
cooper
money
and
it
developed
such
speed
that
it
was
not
safe
to
enter
it
for
the
race
suddenly
cooper
had
an
idea
see
here
i
know
a
man
if
there
a
man
on
earth
who
would
take
that
car
out
he
the
one
he
said
he
is
afraid
of
anything
under
the
shining
sun
a
bicycle
rider
i
raced
against
in
denver
oldfield
his
name
barney
oldfield
never
heard
of
him
said
ford
but
if
you
think
he
would
drive
this
car
let
get
hold
of
him
where
is
he
he
ought
to
be
in
salt
lake
now
cooper
answered
i
wire
him
the
message
went
to
oldfield
that
night
couzens
was
told
of
the
situation
and
the
three
men
waited
anxiously
for
a
telegram
from
salt
lake
it
came
late
the
next
day
asking
some
further
questions
about
the
car
and
stating
that
oldfield
had
never
driven
an
automobile
cooper
wired
again
the
track
meeting
was
to
be
held
the
next
month
time
was
short
oldfield
if
he
came
would
have
to
learn
every
detail
of
handling
the
machine
even
with
an
experienced
man
the
danger
of
driving
that
car
in
the
races
was
great
cooper
and
ford
haunted
the
telegraph
offices
at
last
the
final
reply
came
oldfield
would
drive
the
car
he
would
arrive
on
the
of
june
exactly
one
week
before
the
date
of
the
race
it
was
a
busy
week
ford
and
cooper
bent
every
energy
to
teaching
oldfield
how
to
drive
the
car
they
crammed
his
mind
with
a
mass
of
facts
about
the
motor
the
factor
of
safety
in
making
quick
turns
the
way
to
handle
the
steering
lever
on
the
day
before
the
races
he
took
the
car
out
on
the
tracks
and
made
one
circuit
safely
holding
it
down
to
slow
speed
i
can
handle
her
all
right
i
let
her
out
he
reported
the
day
of
the
track
meeting
dawned
ford
and
cooper
tense
with
anxiety
went
over
the
car
thoroughly
and
coached
oldfield
for
the
last
time
couzens
hiding
his
nervousness
under
a
bland
confident
manner
gathered
his
group
of
business
men
and
took
them
into
the
grandstand
the
was
called
half
a
dozen
cars
were
entered
when
they
had
found
their
places
in
the
field
barney
oldfield
settled
himself
in
his
seat
firmly
grasped
the
tiller
which
steered
the
mighty
car
and
remarked
well
this
chariot
may
kill
me
but
they
say
afterward
that
i
was
going
some
when
the
car
went
over
the
bank
ford
cranked
the
engine
and
the
race
was
on
oldfield
his
long
hair
snapping
in
the
wind
shot
from
the
midst
of
the
astounded
field
like
a
bullet
he
did
not
dare
look
around
he
merely
clung
to
the
tiller
and
gave
that
car
all
the
power
it
had
at
the
end
of
the
first
half
mile
he
was
far
in
the
lead
and
gaining
fast
the
crowd
astounded
hysterical
with
excitement
saw
him
streak
past
the
grandstand
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
of
the
nearest
car
following
on
the
second
lap
he
still
gained
grasping
the
tiller
never
for
a
second
relaxing
that
terrific
speed
he
spun
around
the
course
again
driving
as
if
the
field
was
at
his
heels
he
roared
in
at
the
finish
a
full
half
mile
ahead
of
the
nearest
car
in
a
race
news
of
the
feat
went
around
the
world
and
in
one
day
ford
was
hailed
as
a
mechanical
genius
couzens
brought
the
group
of
business
men
down
to
the
track
and
before
oldfield
was
out
of
the
car
they
had
made
an
appointment
to
meet
ford
next
day
and
form
a
company
the
race
had
convinced
them
some
people
ca
see
a
thing
unless
it
is
written
in
letters
a
mile
high
and
then
illustrated
with
a
diagram
ford
says
meditatively
during
the
following
week
a
company
was
formed
and
ford
was
made
general
manager
superintendent
master
mechanic
and
designer
he
held
a
small
block
of
stock
and
was
paid
a
salary
of
a
month
the
same
amount
he
had
drawn
while
working
for
the
edison
company
he
was
satisfied
the
salary
was
plenty
for
his
needs
apparently
he
waved
that
subject
aside
as
of
little
importance
at
last
he
thought
he
had
an
opportunity
to
put
into
practice
his
plans
for
manufacturing
to
build
up
an
organization
which
was
to
be
as
much
a
ford
factor
as
his
car
was
a
ford
car
the
machine
idea
was
to
be
its
basis
the
old
idea
for
the
watch
factory
altered
and
improved
by
years
of
consideration
was
at
last
to
be
carried
out
he
planned
a
system
of
smooth
economical
efficiency
producing
enormous
numbers
of
cheap
standardized
cars
and
he
began
work
on
it
with
all
the
enthusiasm
he
had
felt
when
he
first
began
building
his
car
but
almost
immediately
there
was
friction
between
him
and
the
men
who
furnished
the
capital
they
insisted
on
his
designing
not
cheaper
cars
but
more
luxurious
ones
they
demanded
that
his
saving
in
reduced
costs
of
production
should
be
added
to
their
profits
not
deducted
from
the
price
of
the
car
they
were
shrewd
successful
business
men
and
they
intended
to
run
their
factory
on
business
lines
i
prefer
not
to
talk
about
that
year
ford
says
those
men
were
right
according
to
their
lights
i
suppose
anyway
some
of
them
are
still
building
a
fairly
successful
car
in
the
to
class
and
i
do
want
to
criticize
other
men
in
the
automobile
field
the
trouble
was
that
they
could
see
things
my
way
they
could
not
understand
that
the
thing
that
is
best
for
the
greatest
number
of
people
is
bound
to
win
in
the
end
they
said
i
was
impractical
that
notions
like
that
would
hurt
business
they
said
ideals
were
all
very
well
but
they
would
work
i
did
not
know
anything
about
business
they
said
there
was
an
immediate
profit
of
per
cent
in
selling
a
car
why
take
the
risk
of
building
forty
cheap
cars
at
per
cent
profit
they
said
common
people
would
not
buy
automobiles
anyway
i
thought
the
more
people
who
had
a
good
thing
the
better
my
car
was
going
to
be
cheap
so
the
man
that
needed
it
most
could
afford
to
buy
it
i
kept
on
designing
cheaper
cars
they
objected
finally
it
came
to
a
point
where
i
had
to
give
up
my
idea
or
get
out
of
the
company
of
course
i
got
out
over
thirty
years
old
with
a
wife
and
child
to
support
and
no
capital
henry
ford
still
maintaining
that
policy
of
the
greatest
good
to
the
greatest
number
must
win
in
the
end
left
the
company
which
had
given
him
an
opportunity
to
be
a
rich
man
and
announced
that
somehow
he
would
manufacture
his
own
car
in
his
own
way
chapter

manufacturing

henry
ford
talent
for
friendliness
helped
him
wills
who
had
been
working
with
ford
as
a
draughtsman
came
with
him
into
the
new
company
he
had
a
few
hundred
dollars
which
he
was
willing
to
stake
on
ford
ability
couzens
who
had
helped
organize
the
first
company
came
also
and
turned
his
business
talents
to
the
task
of
raising
capital
to
start
the
new
concern
while
he
was
struggling
with
the
problems
of
organization
henry
ford
rented
an
old
shack
on
mack
avenue
moved
his
tools
from
the
old
shed
and
with
a
couple
of
machinists
to
help
him
began
building
his
cheap
cars
news
of
his
venture
spread
in
detroit
the
cars
sold
before
they
were
built
men
found
their
way
to
the
crude
shop
talked
to
ford
in
his
greasy
overalls
and
paid
down
deposits
on
cars
for
future
delivery
often
these
deposits
helped
to
buy
material
for
the
same
cars
they
purchased
ford
was
working
on
a
narrow
margin
every
dollar
which
could
be
squeezed
from
the
week
earnings
after
expenses
were
paid
went
directly
into
more
material
for
more
cars
at
first
his
machinists
went
home
at
the
end
of
their
regular
hours
then
ford
worked
alone
far
into
the
night
building
engines
before
long
the
men
became
vitally
interested
in
ford
success
and
returned
after
supper
to
help
him
meantime
a
few
men
had
been
found
who
were
willing
to
buy
stock
in
the
new
company
it
was
capitalized
at
of
which
was
paid
in
then
ford
set
to
work
in
earnest
the
force
was
increased
to
nearly
forty
men
and
wills
became
manager
of
the
mechanical
department
carloads
of
material
were
ordered
on
sixty
days
time
every
pound
of
iron
or
inch
of
wire
calculated
with
the
utmost
nicety
so
that
each
shipment
would
be
sufficient
to
build
a
certain
number
of
completed
cars
without
the
waste
of
ten
cents
worth
of
material
then
ford
and
couzens
set
out
to
sell
the
cars
before
payment
for
the
material
came
due
ford
set
a
price
of
a
car
an
amount
which
he
figured
would
cover
the
cost
of
material
wages
and
overhead
and
leave
a
margin
for
buying
more
material
a
thousand
anxieties
now
filled
his
days
and
nights
fifteen
thousand
dollars
was
very
little
money
for
his
plant
wages
alone
would
eat
it
up
in
ten
weeks
the
raw
material
must
be
made
into
cars
sold
and
the
money
collected
before
it
could
be
paid
for
many
times
a
check
from
a
buyer
won
the
race
with
the
bill
from
the
foundry
by
a
margin
of
hours
often
on
pay
day
ford
faced
the
prospect
of
being
unable
to
pay
the
men
until
he
should
have
sold
a
shipment
of
cars
not
yet
built
but
the
cars
sold
their
simplicity
of
construction
their
power
above
all
their
cheapness
in
a
day
when
automobiles
almost
without
exception
sold
for
to
brought
buyers
in
a
few
weeks
orders
came
from
cleveland
for
them
shortly
afterward
a
dealer
in
chicago
wrote
for
an
agency
there
still
the
success
of
the
venture
depended
from
week
to
week
on
a
thousand
chances
ford
with
his
genius
for
factory
management
reduced
the
waste
of
material
or
labor
to
the
smallest
minimum
he
worked
on
new
designs
for
simpler
cheaper
motors
he
figured
orders
for
material
his
own
living
expenses
were
cut
to
the
bone
every
cent
of
profit
on
sales
went
into
the
factory
nearly
a
thousand
cars
were
sold
that
year
but
with
the
beginning
of
winter
sales
decreased
almost
stopped
the
factory
must
be
kept
running
in
order
to
have
cars
for
the
spring
trade
close
figuring
would
enable
them
to
keep
it
open
but
an
early
brisk
market
would
be
necessary
to
save
the
company
in
the
spring
in
this
emergency
ford
recalled
the
great
advertising
value
of
racing
he
had
designed
a
car
to
be
put
on
the
market
the
following
year
if
he
could
make
a
spectacular
demonstration
of
construction
as
compared
with
the
old
motors
the
success
of
his
spring
sales
would
be
assured
ford
announced
that
in
november
he
would
try
for
the
world
speed
record
in
a
car
of
his
own
construction
the
old
machine
in
which
barney
oldfield
had
made
his
debut
as
an
automobile
driver
was
brought
out
and
overhauled
the
body
was
rebuilt
so
that
in
form
it
was
much
like
the
racing
cars
of
ford
himself
remodeled
the
motor
the
test
was
to
be
made
on
the
frozen
surface
of
lake
clair
the
course
was
surveyed
on
the
appointed
day
with
ford
himself
as
driver
the
motor
car
appeared
for
its
second
trial
a
stiff
wind
was
blowing
over
the
ice
the
surface
of
the
lake
apparently
smooth
was
in
reality
seamed
with
slight
crevices
and
roughened
with
frozen
snow
ford
muffled
in
a
fur
coat
with
a
fur
cap
pulled
down
over
his
ears
went
over
it
anxiously
noting
mentally
the
worst
spots
then
he
cranked
the
car
settled
himself
in
the
seat
and
nodded
to
the
starter
the
signal
came
ford
threw
on
the
power
and
was
off
the
car
striking
the
ice
fissure
leaped
into
the
air
two
wheels
at
a
time
ford
clinging
to
the
tiller
was
almost
thrown
from
his
seat
wildly
bouncing
like
a
ball
the
machine
shot
over
the
ice
twice
it
almost
upset
but
ford
struggling
to
keep
the
course
never
shut
down
the
power
he
finished
the
mile
in
seconds
beating
the
world
record
by
seven
seconds
the
success
of
next
year
sales
was
certain
the
following
day
when
ford
reached
the
factory
wills
met
him
with
an
anxious
face
it
was
pay
day
and
there
was
no
money
we
did
bother
you
about
it
last
week
because
you
were
so
busy
with
the
race
wills
said
we
thought
up
to
the
last
minute
that
the
check
from
chicago
would
come
it
was
due
two
days
ago
we
wired
yesterday
and
got
no
answer
couzens
left
this
morning
on
the
early
train
to
find
out
what
is
wrong
you
know
how
it
is
the
men
want
their
money
for
over
christmas
the
company
wants
men
and
they
offering
more
money
than
we
can
pay
i
afraid
our
men
will
quit
and
if
they
do
and
we
ca
get
out
the
cincinnati
order
next
week
ford
knew
that
to
raise
more
money
from
the
stockholders
would
be
impossible
they
had
gone
in
as
deeply
as
they
could
to
sacrifice
a
block
of
his
own
stock
would
be
to
lose
control
of
the
company
and
besides
it
would
be
difficult
to
sell
it
the
company
was
still
struggling
for
existence
it
had
paid
no
dividends
and
other
automobile
manufacturers
were
already
paying
the
enormous
profits
that
led
in
the
next
few
years
to
wild
disastrous
expansion
in
the
automobile
business
the
ford
company
had
no
marketable
assets
nothing
but
the
rented
building
the
equipment
and
a
few
unfilled
orders
well
if
we
pull
through
the
men
will
have
to
do
it
said
ford
tell
them
about
it
that
evening
when
the
day
work
was
over
and
the
men
came
to
the
office
to
get
their
pay
they
found
ford
standing
in
the
doorway
he
said
he
had
something
to
tell
them
when
they
had
all
gathered
in
a
group
nearly
a
hundred
by
this
time
he
stood
on
a
chair
so
that
all
of
them
could
hear
what
he
had
to
say
and
told
them
the
exact
situation
now
men
we
can
pull
through
all
right
if
you
help
out
now
he
concluded
you
know
the
kind
of
car
we
selling
and
the
price
and
you
know
what
the
new
one
did
yesterday
we
can
get
through
the
winter
on
our
unfinished
orders
if
we
never
get
that
chicago
check
next
year
we
have
a
big
business
but
it
all
depends
on
you
if
you
quit
now
we
done
for
what
about
it
will
you
stay
sure
mr
ford
you
bet
we
will
old
man
we
with
you
do
you
forget
it
they
said
before
they
left
the
plant
most
of
them
came
up
to
assure
him
personally
that
they
would
stand
by
the
ford
company
next
day
they
all
arrived
promptly
for
work
and
during
the
week
they
broke
all
previous
records
in
the
number
of
cars
turned
out
war
between
capital
and
labor
is
just
like
any
other
kind
of
war
henry
ford
says
it
happens
because
people
do
not
understand
each
other
the
boss
ought
to
show
his
books
to
his
employees
let
them
see
what
he
working
for
they
just
as
intelligent
as
he
is
and
if
he
needs
help
they
turn
in
and
work
hours
a
day
if
they
have
to
to
keep
the
business
going
more
than
that
they
use
their
heads
for
him
they
help
him
in
hundreds
of
ways
he
never
would
think
of
the
only
trouble
is
that
people
make
a
distinction
between
practical
things
and
spiritual
qualities
i
tell
you
loyalty
and
friendliness
and
helping
the
other
man
along
are
the
only
really
valuable
things
in
this
world
and
they
bring
all
the
advantages
along
with
them
every
time
if
every
one
of
us
had
the
courage
to
believe
that
and
act
on
it
war
and
waste
and
misery
of
all
kinds
would
be
wiped
out
over
night
chapter
xxii
automobiles
for
the
masses
in
a
short
time
couzens
returned
from
chicago
bringing
not
only
the
delayed
check
but
several
orders
as
well
which
he
had
obtained
largely
because
of
the
astounding
record
made
by
the
ford
car
in
its
race
over
the
ice
on
lake
clair
the
ford
company
was
not
yet
firmly
established
but
prospects
were
bright
america
was
awaking
to
the
possibilities
of
the
automobile
not
merely
as
a
machine
for
spectacular
exhibitions
of
daring
and
skill
at
track
meetings
or
as
the
plaything
of
wealthy
men
but
as
a
practical
time
and
for
the
average
person
the
automobile
industry
rose
almost
overnight
orders
poured
into
the
offices
of
companies
already
organized
new
companies
were
formed
by
dozens
capitalized
at
millions
of
dollars
concerns
sprang
up
like
mushrooms
flooded
the
country
with
schemes
established
factories
where
parts
of
motor
cars
bought
elsewhere
were
assembled
fortunes
were
made
and
lost
and
made
again
almost
every
day
saw
new
cars
on
the
market
every
one
wanted
an
automobile
it
was
a
luxury
it
appealed
to
our
longing
to
have
something
just
a
little
better
than
our
neighbors
could
afford
at
the
same
time
its
obvious
usefulness
was
an
argument
which
overcame
economy
the
comic
supplements
those
faithful
reflectors
of
american
life
in
terms
of
the
ridiculous
played
with
every
variation
of
the
theme
he
mortgaged
the
home
to
buy
an
automobile
amid
this
mounting
excitement
in
spite
of
millions
to
be
made
by
building
a
car
bigger
finer
more
beautiful
and
luxurious
than
those
of
his
competitors
henry
ford
still
clung
firmly
to
his
idea
he
seems
to
have
been
at
that
time
the
only
automobile
manufacturer
who
realized
that
the
automobile
supplied
a
real
need
of
the
average
man
and
that
the
average
man
is
a
frugal
individual
used
to
living
without
those
things
he
must
mortgage
his
home
to
get
the
automobile
of
those
days
was
like
a
steam
yacht
ford
says
it
was
built
for
only
a
few
people
now
anything
that
is
good
for
only
a
few
people
is
really
no
good
it
got
to
be
good
for
everybody
or
in
the
end
it
will
not
survive
radical
philosophy
that
you
might
hear
it
from
a
street
corner
orator
one
of
that
dissatisfied
multitude
which
will
insist
in
spite
of
all
the
good
things
we
have
in
this
country
that
merely
because
those
things
are
not
good
for
them
they
are
not
good
there
is
something
of
marx
in
such
a
statement
something
of
george
washington
even
something
of
christianity
no
wonder
men
were
astounded
by
the
notion
that
success
could
be
founded
on
a
theory
like
that
it
plain
common
sense
i
tell
you
ford
insisted
and
in
spite
of
good
advice
in
spite
of
sound
business
reasoning
that
obstinate
man
went
on
in
his
own
way
and
acted
on
that
belief
the
ford
cars
were
cheap
already
underpriced
nearly
a
thousand
dollars
in
comparison
with
other
cars
they
were
to
be
sold
still
cheaper
ford
insisted
every
cent
he
could
save
in
construction
in
factory
management
in
shrewd
buying
of
material
was
deducted
from
the
selling
price
the
cars
sold
orders
accumulated
faster
than
they
could
be
filled
in
the
shop
on
mack
avenue
the
profits
went
back
into
the
factory
more
men
were
added
to
the
more
machinery
was
installed
and
still
the
orders
came
and
the
output
could
not
keep
up
with
them
ford
could
afford
to
buy
her
own
hats
instead
of
making
them
to
get
a
new
set
of
furniture
for
the
parlor
to
purchase
as
many
gloves
and
shoes
as
she
wanted
she
did
these
things
she
even
talked
of
getting
a
hired
girl
to
do
the
cooking
but
ford
himself
made
little
change
in
his
way
of
living
he
had
always
dressed
warmly
and
comfortably
eaten
when
he
was
hungry
slept
soundly
enough
on
an
ordinary
bed
he
saw
no
way
to
increase
his
comforts
by
spending
more
money
on
himself
more
than
enough
money
to
keep
him
comfortable
is
no
use
to
a
man
he
says
you
ca
squander
money
on
yourself
without
hurting
yourself
money
only
a
lubricant
to
keep
business
going
he
continued
to
work
hard
designing
simpler
cheaper
cars
struggling
with
business
difficulties
as
they
arose
planning
a
new
factory
most
of
all
he
was
interested
in
the
new
factory
the
success
of
his
car
provided
money
enough
to
warrant
building
it
at
last
a
small
tract
of
land
on
piquette
avenue
was
bought
and
ford
prepared
to
move
from
the
rented
mack
avenue
place
the
dream
was
finally
to
be
realized
henry
ford
declared
that
by
a
large
equipment
of
special
machinery
and
a
sympathetic
organization
of
the
work
cars
could
be
produced
at
a
hitherto
price
he
planned
to
the
smallest
detail
to
the
most
minute
fraction
of
space
time
labor
the
production
of
those
cars
every
part
was
to
be
machined
to
exact
size
no
supplementary
fitting
in
the
assembling
room
was
to
be
necessary
from
the
time
the
raw
iron
entered
one
end
of
the
factory
till
the
finished
car
rolled
away
from
the
other
end
there
was
not
to
be
a
moment
delay
a
wasted
motion
the
various
parts
all
alike
to
the
fraction
of
an
inch
were
to
fit
together
with
automatic
precision
and
ford
announced
that
he
would
produce
cars
in
a
single
year
the
manufacturing
world
was
stunned
by
the
announcement
then
it
laughed
very
few
people
believed
that
ford
would
go
far
with
such
a
radical
departure
from
all
accepted
practice
but
the
new
building
was
finished
ford
installed
his
machinery
according
to
his
plans
and
when
the
wheels
began
to
turn
the
world
learned
a
new
lesson
in
efficiency
still
ford
success
in
the
automobile
field
was
not
easily
won
as
a
poor
mechanic
he
had
fought
weariness
and
poverty
and
ridicule
to
build
his
motor
car
as
an
unknown
inventor
still
poor
he
had
struggled
for
a
foothold
in
the
business
world
and
got
it
now
he
was
in
for
a
long
expensive
legal
battle
before
he
should
be
able
to
feel
secure
in
his
success
the
association
of
licensed
automobile
manufacturers
a
combination
of
of
the
biggest
motor
car
companies
brought
suit
against
the
ford
company
to
recover
tremendous
sums
of
money
because
of
alleged
violation
of
the
seldon
patent
seldon
held
a
basic
patent
covering
the
use
of
the
gasoline
engine
as
motive
power
in
vehicles
when
automobiles
began
to
be
put
on
the
market
he
claimed
his
right
under
that
patent
to
a
royalty
on
all
such
vehicles
other
automobile
manufacturers
almost
without
exception
acceded
to
his
claim
and
operated
under
a
lease
from
him
adding
the
royalty
to
the
selling
price
henry
ford
balked
he
had
been
running
a
gasoline
engine
long
before
seldon
had
applied
for
his
patent
furthermore
the
royalties
interfered
with
the
dream
of
cheapening
his
cars
he
flatly
refused
to
make
the
payments
the
lessees
of
the
seldon
rights
perceiving
in
ford
a
dangerous
adversary
in
the
automobile
field
who
would
become
still
more
dangerous
if
he
succeeded
in
eliminating
the
royalty
payments
from
his
manufacturing
costs
immediately
began
to
fight
him
with
all
the
millions
at
their
command
chapter
xxiii
fighting
the
seldon
patent
by
sheer
force
of
an
idea
backed
only
by
hard
work
henry
ford
had
established
a
new
principle
in
mechanics
he
had
created
new
methods
in
the
manufacturing
world
methods
substantially
those
which
prevail
in
manufacturing
now
he
entered
the
legal
field
his
fight
on
the
seldon
patent
a
fight
that
lasted
nearly
ten
years
was
a
sensation
not
only
in
the
automobile
world
but
among
lawyers
everywhere
the
intricacies
of
the
case
baffled
the
jurists
before
whom
it
was
tried
time
and
again
decisions
adverse
to
ford
were
handed
down
each
time
ford
came
back
again
more
determined
than
before
carried
the
contest
to
a
higher
court
and
fought
the
battle
over
again
on
one
side
the
association
of
licensed
automobile
manufacturers
was
struggling
to
save
patent
rights
for
which
they
had
paid
vast
sums
of
money
to
maintain
high
prices
for
automobiles
and
to
protect
their
combination
of
manufacturing
interests
on
the
other
ford
was
fighting
to
release
the
industry
from
paying
tribute
to
a
patent
which
he
believed
unsound
to
smash
the
combination
of
manufacturers
and
to
keep
down
his
own
factory
costs
so
that
he
could
make
a
still
cheaper
car
with
the
first
adverse
decision
the
carried
the
fight
into
the
newspapers
most
of
us
can
recall
the
days
when
from
coast
to
coast
the
newspapers
of
america
blossomed
with
page
advertisements
warning
people
against
buying
ford
cars
asserting
that
every
owner
of
a
ford
car
was
liable
to
prosecution
for
damages
under
the
seldon
patent
rights
those
were
chaotic
years
in
the
industry
the
hysteria
which
followed
the
huge
of
the
first
companies
checked
only
temporarily
by
the
panic
of
mounted
again
in
a
rising
wave
of
excitement
dozens
of
companies
sprang
up
sold
stock
assembled
a
few
cars
and
went
down
in
ruin
buyers
of
their
cars
were
left
stranded
with
automobiles
for
which
they
could
not
get
new
parts
it
was
asserted
that
the
ford
motor
company
unable
to
pay
the
enormous
sums
accruing
if
the
seldon
patent
was
upheld
would
be
one
of
the
companies
to
fail
buyers
were
urged
to
play
safe
by
purchasing
a
recognized
car
a
car
made
by
the
licensed
manufacturers
ford
already
involved
in
a
business
fight
against
the
association
and
its
millions
thus
found
himself
in
danger
of
losing
the
confidence
of
the
public
the
story
of
those
years
is
one
which
can
not
be
adequately
told
ford
was
working
harder
than
he
had
ever
done
while
he
was
building
his
first
car
in
the
old
shed
he
was
one
of
the
first
men
at
the
factory
every
morning
and
long
after
detroit
was
asleep
he
was
still
hard
at
work
conferring
with
lawyers
discussing
with
couzens
the
latest
disaster
that
threatened
struggling
with
business
problems
meeting
emergencies
in
the
selling
field
and
always
planning
to
better
the
factory
management
and
to
lower
the
price
and
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
car
the
car
sold
ford
had
built
it
for
common
men
for
the
vast
body
of
america
people
and
it
was
cheap
enough
to
be
within
their
reach
ford
knew
that
if
he
could
keep
their
confidence
he
could
win
in
the
end
he
met
the
attack
of
the
by
printing
huge
advertisements
guaranteeing
purchasers
of
his
cars
from
prosecution
under
the
seldon
patents
and
backed
his
guarantee
by
the
bond
of
a
new
york
security
company
then
he
appealed
the
patent
case
and
kept
on
fighting
in
the
farmer
boy
who
had
started
out
twenty
years
before
with
nothing
but
his
bare
hands
and
an
idea
found
himself
at
the
head
of
one
of
america
largest
business
organizations
that
year
his
factory
made
and
sold
cars
every
machine
sold
increased
his
liabilities
in
case
he
lost
the
patent
fight
but
the
business
was
now
on
a
firm
foundation
agencies
had
been
established
in
all
parts
of
the
world
orders
came
pouring
in
profits
were
rolling
up
ford
found
his
net
earnings
increasing
faster
than
he
could
possibly
put
them
back
into
the
business
at
the
end
of
that
year
he
and
couzens
sat
in
their
offices
going
over
the
balance
sheets
of
the
company
the
size
of
the
bank
balance
was
most
satisfactory
the
factory
was
running
to
the
limit
of
its
capacity
orders
were
waiting
prospects
were
bright
for
the
following
season
ford
leaned
back
in
his
chair
well
i
guess
we
out
of
the
woods
all
right
he
said
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
ceiling
remember
that
time
in
the
mack
avenue
place
he
began
when
that
chicago
check
did
come
in
and
we
could
pay
the
men
i
should
say
i
do
and
the
day
we
got
the
first
order
from
cleveland
remember
how
you
worked
in
the
shop
yourself
to
get
it
out
and
you
hustled
out
and
got
material
on
sixty
days
time
and
the
boys
worked
all
night
and
we
had
to
wait
till
the
money
came
from
cleveland
before
we
could
give
them
their
overtime
that
was
a
great
bunch
of
men
we
had
then
they
began
to
talk
them
over
most
of
them
were
managers
of
departments
now
one
was
handling
the
sales
force
another
had
developed
into
a
driver
and
won
many
trophies
and
broken
many
records
with
the
ford
car
wills
was
superintendent
of
the
factory
i
tell
you
couzens
you
and
i
have
been
at
the
head
of
the
concern
and
we
done
some
big
things
together
but
if
it
had
been
for
the
men
we
be
a
long
way
from
where
we
are
ford
said
at
last
now
we
have
some
money
we
do
need
for
the
business
we
ought
to
divide
with
them
let
do
it
i
with
you
couzens
said
heartily
and
reached
for
his
pencil
eagerly
as
two
boys
they
sat
there
for
another
hour
figuring
they
began
with
checks
for
the
men
they
remembered
men
who
had
been
with
them
in
the
first
days
of
the
company
men
who
had
done
some
special
thing
which
won
their
notice
men
who
were
making
good
records
in
the
shops
or
on
the
sales
force
but
there
seemed
no
place
to
draw
the
line
after
all
every
man
who
working
for
us
is
helping
ford
decided
let
give
every
one
of
them
a
christmas
present
couzens
agreed
we
have
the
clerical
department
figure
it
out
the
men
who
have
been
with
us
longest
the
most
and
so
on
down
to
the
last
errand
boy
been
with
us
a
year
what
do
you
say
ford
said
yes
with
enthusiasm
and
so
it
was
settled
that
year
every
employee
of
the
company
received
an
extra
check
in
his
december
pay
envelope
ford
had
reached
a
point
in
his
business
life
where
he
must
stop
and
consider
what
he
should
do
with
the
money
his
work
had
brought
him
and
those
extra
checks
were
the
first
result
for
twenty
years
ford
had
spent
all
his
energy
all
his
time
and
thought
in
one
thing
his
work
if
he
had
divided
his
interests
if
he
had
allowed
a
liking
for
amusement
ease
finer
clothes
admiration
to
hinder
his
work
in
the
old
shed
he
would
never
have
built
his
car
if
he
had
cared
more
for
personal
pleasure
and
applause
than
he
did
for
his
idea
he
would
have
allowed
his
factory
plan
to
be
altered
twisted
out
of
shape
and
forgotten
when
he
first
found
capital
to
manufacture
the
car
but
from
the
day
he
left
his
farm
till
now
he
has
subordinated
everything
else
to
his
machine
idea
he
applied
it
first
to
an
engine
then
to
a
factory
he
fought
through
innumerable
difficulties
to
make
those
ideas
into
realities
he
destroyed
old
conceptions
of
mechanics
and
of
factory
management
he
built
up
a
great
financial
success
now
he
found
himself
with
a
new
problem
to
face
the
problem
of
a
great
fortune
piling
up
in
his
hands
chapter
xxiv
the
greatest
good
to
the
greatest
number
the
response
to
that
first
christmas
gift
from
the
ford
company
to
its
employees
was
another
proof
of
ford
theory
that
friendliness
pays
in
the
following
month
the
production
of
cars
broke
all
january
records
salesmen
with
a
new
feeling
of
loyalty
to
the
firm
increased
their
efforts
worked
with
greater
enthusiasm
and
their
orders
jumped
the
fight
with
the
association
still
raged
in
the
courts
and
in
the
newspapers
but
the
factory
wheels
were
turning
faster
than
ever
before
more
cars
were
pouring
out
more
people
were
buying
that
year
the
ford
organization
made
and
sold
cars
ford
had
made
good
his
prophecy
that
the
new
factory
would
produce
cars
in
one
year
the
phenomenal
growth
of
his
business
had
begun
his
own
fortune
was
doubling
and
doubling
again
america
had
produced
another
millionaire
ford
himself
believes
that
any
one
who
will
pay
the
price
he
has
paid
can
make
a
financial
success
as
great
poverty
does
hold
a
man
down
he
says
money
does
amount
to
anything
it
has
no
real
value
whatever
any
young
man
who
has
a
good
idea
and
works
hard
enough
will
succeed
money
will
come
to
him
what
do
i
mean
by
a
good
idea
i
mean
an
idea
that
will
work
out
for
the
best
interests
of
every
one
an
idea
for
something
that
will
benefit
the
world
that
the
kind
of
an
idea
the
world
wants
this
country
has
produced
hundreds
of
men
whose
lives
prove
this
statement
men
who
have
built
railroads
telephones
telegraph
systems
great
merchandising
organizations
these
men
have
subordinated
every
personal
pleasure
to
their
work
they
have
exhausted
their
minds
and
bodies
driven
themselves
mercilessly
used
every
ounce
of
energy
and
ability
and
won
the
tragedy
for
them
and
for
our
country
is
that
in
winning
the
fight
most
of
them
have
lost
their
perspective
on
it
they
themselves
have
become
absorbed
by
the
machine
they
have
built
up
the
money
they
have
amassed
usually
means
very
little
to
them
but
business
is
their
passion
with
millions
upon
millions
piling
up
to
their
credit
they
continue
to
hold
down
wages
to
protect
their
profits
to
keep
the
business
running
as
it
has
always
run
that
business
has
been
built
only
because
fundamentally
it
was
for
the
greatest
good
to
the
greatest
number
but
in
the
long
fight
they
have
lost
sight
of
that
fact
let
a
new
project
arise
which
is
for
the
general
good
and
it
will
hurt
business
they
cry
in
alarm
ford
kept
his
viewpoint
partly
because
of
his
years
on
the
farm
where
he
worked
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
other
men
and
learned
essential
democracy
partly
because
most
of
his
work
had
been
in
mechanics
rather
than
in
business
but
most
of
all
because
he
is
a
simple
man
the
tremendous
ford
organization
did
not
absorb
him
he
had
applied
his
machine
idea
first
to
an
engine
then
to
a
factory
in
time
he
was
to
apply
it
to
society
as
a
whole
that
christmas
present
of
ours
is
paying
better
dividends
than
any
money
we
ever
spent
he
said
to
couzens
with
a
grin
first
thing
we
know
the
men
be
paying
us
back
more
than
we
gave
them
look
here
he
spread
on
couzens
desk
a
double
handful
of
letters
from
the
men
they
like
it
he
said
soberly
some
of
them
say
they
were
worrying
about
christmas
bills
and
so
on
those
checks
took
a
load
off
their
minds
and
they
pitching
in
and
working
hard
to
show
they
appreciate
it
i
guess
in
the
long
run
anything
that
is
good
for
the
men
is
good
for
the
company
in
the
months
that
followed
he
continued
to
turn
over
in
his
mind
various
ideas
which
occurred
to
him
based
on
that
principle
the
ford
employees
and
agents
now
numbered
tens
of
thousands
they
were
scattered
all
over
the
earth
from
bombay
to
nova
scotia
switzerland
peru
bermuda
africa
alaska
india
everywhere
were
workers
helping
ford
black
men
in
turbans
yellow
men
in
embroidered
robes
men
of
all
races
and
languages
speaking
thinking
living
in
ways
incomprehensible
to
that
quiet
man
who
sat
in
his
office
in
detroit
were
part
of
the
vast
machine
out
of
which
his
millions
poured
he
thought
it
over
that
great
machine
he
knew
machines
he
knew
that
the
smallest
part
of
one
was
as
necessary
as
the
largest
that
every
nut
and
screw
was
indispensable
to
the
success
of
the
whole
and
while
he
brooded
over
the
mighty
machine
his
genius
had
created
the
thought
slowly
formed
itself
in
his
mind
that
those
multiplying
millions
of
his
were
the
weak
spot
in
the
organization
those
millions
represented
energy
and
through
him
they
were
draining
out
of
the
machine
accumulating
in
a
useless
idle
store
some
way
they
must
be
put
back
everybody
helps
me
he
said
if
i
going
to
do
my
part
i
must
help
everybody
a
new
problem
filled
his
mind
how
should
he
put
his
money
back
into
that
smooth
efficient
organization
in
such
a
way
as
to
help
all
parts
of
it
without
disorganizing
it
it
was
now
a
part
of
the
business
system
of
the
world
founded
on
financial
and
social
principles
which
underlie
all
society
it
was
no
small
matter
to
alter
it
meantime
there
were
immediate
practical
necessities
to
be
met
his
business
had
far
outgrown
the
piquette
avenue
plant
a
new
factory
must
be
built
he
bought
a
tract
of
acres
in
the
northern
part
of
detroit
and
began
to
plan
the
construction
of
his
present
factory
a
number
of
huge
buildings
covering
more
than
acres
in
this
mammoth
plant
ford
had
at
last
the
opportunity
unhampered
by
any
want
of
capital
to
put
into
operation
his
old
ideas
of
factory
management
here
men
were
to
work
quickly
efficiently
without
the
loss
of
a
moment
or
a
motion
all
of
them
integral
parts
of
one
great
machine
each
department
makes
one
part
of
the
ford
car
complete
from
raw
material
to
the
finished
product
and
every
part
is
carried
swiftly
and
directly
by
gravity
to
the
assembling
room
but
ford
new
idea
also
began
to
express
itself
here
he
meant
to
consider
not
only
the
efficiency
but
the
happiness
and
comfort
of
his
men
the
walls
were
made
of
plate
glass
so
that
every
part
of
the
workrooms
were
light
and
well
ventilated
one
whole
department
employing
men
was
established
to
do
nothing
but
sweep
floors
wash
windows
look
after
sanitary
conditions
generally
the
floors
are
scrubbed
every
week
with
hot
water
and
alkali
men
are
employed
constantly
in
painting
the
walls
and
ceilings
keeping
everything
fresh
and
clean
that
winter
the
christmas
checks
went
again
to
all
the
employees
ford
was
still
working
out
a
real
plan
by
which
his
millions
could
help
meantime
he
divided
his
profits
in
this
makeshift
fashion
the
following
year
the
company
moved
to
its
new
quarters
in
that
atmosphere
of
light
and
comfort
the
men
worked
better
than
ever
before
production
broke
another
record
cars
in
one
year
were
made
and
sold
and
the
automobile
world
is
waiting
to
hear
the
next
announcement
from
henry
ford
said
a
trade
journal
at
that
time
whether
or
not
he
has
another
sensation
in
store
is
the
livest
topic
of
discussion
in
detroit
manufacturing
circles
nay
even
throughout
the
world
henry
ford
was
preparing
another
sensation
but
this
time
it
was
to
be
in
a
larger
field
he
had
startled
the
world
first
with
a
motor
car
next
with
a
factory
now
he
was
thinking
of
broad
economic
problems
chapter
xxv
five
dollars
a
day
minimum
the
seldon
patent
fight
had
continued
through
all
the
early
years
of
ford
struggle
to
establish
himself
in
business
at
last
it
was
settled
ford
won
it
the
whole
industry
was
freed
from
an
oppressive
tax
and
his
long
fight
was
over
immediately
of
course
other
cars
came
into
the
field
other
manufacturers
tardily
following
ford
began
the
downward
pressure
in
prices
which
now
makes
it
possible
for
thousands
of
persons
with
only
moderate
means
to
own
automobiles
for
the
first
time
ford
faced
competition
in
his
own
price
class
innumerable
business
problems
confronted
the
from
the
time
he
opened
his
office
doors
in
the
early
morning
until
the
last
workman
had
left
the
plant
and
only
his
light
was
burning
business
men
came
financiers
salesmen
lawyers
designers
every
day
for
two
hours
he
conferred
with
his
superintendents
and
foremen
in
the
main
factory
every
detail
of
the
business
was
under
his
supervision
a
smaller
man
or
a
less
simple
one
would
have
been
absorbed
by
the
sheer
mass
of
work
ford
settled
every
problem
by
his
own
simple
rule
do
what
is
fundamentally
best
for
everybody
it
will
work
out
for
our
interests
in
the
end
and
always
he
was
pondering
the
big
problem
of
putting
back
into
active
use
the
millions
that
were
accumulating
to
his
credit
every
year
the
price
was
lowered
on
his
cars
following
his
original
policy
of
making
the
automobile
cheap
still
the
sales
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
his
margin
of
profit
on
each
car
mounted
into
a
greater
total
the
whole
system
is
wrong
he
says
people
have
the
wrong
idea
of
money
they
think
it
is
valuable
in
itself
they
try
to
get
all
they
can
and
they
built
up
a
system
where
one
man
has
too
much
and
another
not
enough
as
long
as
that
system
is
working
there
does
not
seem
any
way
to
even
things
up
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
what
i
could
money
valuable
i
tell
you
gold
is
the
least
valuable
metal
in
the
world
edison
says
it
is
no
good
at
all
it
is
too
soft
to
make
a
single
useful
article
suppose
there
was
only
one
loaf
of
bread
in
the
world
would
all
the
money
on
earth
buy
it
from
the
man
who
had
it
money
itself
is
nothing
absolutely
nothing
it
is
only
valuable
as
a
transmitter
a
method
of
handling
things
that
are
valuable
the
minute
one
man
gets
more
of
it
than
he
can
use
to
buy
the
real
things
he
needs
the
surplus
is
sheer
waste
it
is
energy
that
is
no
good
to
anybody
every
bit
of
energy
that
is
wasted
that
way
hurts
the
whole
world
and
in
the
end
it
hurts
the
man
who
has
it
as
much
as
it
hurts
anybody
look
here
you
make
a
machine
to
do
something
useful
do
you
well
then
if
it
is
built
so
that
it
keeps
wasting
energy
does
the
whole
machine
wear
itself
out
without
doing
half
as
much
as
it
should
that
last
energy
bad
for
every
part
of
the
machine
well
that
is
the
way
the
world
is
running
now
the
whole
system
is
wrong
a
very
little
thought
brings
almost
any
of
us
to
that
conclusion
especially
if
the
thinker
is
one
whose
surplus
money
is
all
in
the
other
man
bank
account
but
ford
held
to
that
thought
as
few
of
us
would
with
the
surplus
millions
in
his
own
hands
furthermore
he
proposed
not
merely
to
think
but
to
act
on
that
thought
he
is
not
a
man
to
act
hastily
before
he
made
his
engine
he
worked
out
the
drawings
before
he
distributed
his
money
he
selected
men
from
the
workers
in
his
shop
and
sent
them
out
to
learn
all
they
could
of
the
living
conditions
of
the
other
thousands
they
worked
for
a
year
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
ford
going
carefully
over
their
reports
saw
plainly
where
his
surplus
money
should
go
over
of
the
men
working
in
the
ford
plant
were
living
in
dire
poverty
in
unspeakable
home
conditions
families
were
huddled
into
tenements
where
in
wet
weather
water
stood
on
the
floor
wives
were
ill
uncared
for
babies
were
dressed
in
rags
another
men
in
his
employ
were
living
in
conditions
which
could
only
be
called
fair
only
out
of
owned
their
own
homes
yet
the
employees
in
the
ford
shops
were
above
the
average
of
factory
workingmen
they
were
paid
the
regular
scale
of
wages
not
overworked
and
their
surroundings
at
the
plant
were
sanitary
and
pleasant
in
those
terrible
figures
ford
was
seeing
merely
the
ordinary
accustomed
result
of
the
wasted
energy
represented
in
those
idle
millions
of
dollars
he
went
over
them
thoroughly
noting
that
the
scale
of
living
grew
steadily
better
as
the
salaries
increased
observing
that
the
most
wretched
class
was
mainly
composed
of
foreign
workmen
ignorant
unskilled
labor
most
of
them
unable
to
speak
english
he
figured
thought
drew
his
own
conclusions
he
had
been
studying
relief
plans
methods
of
factory
management
in
germany
welfare
work
of
all
kinds
when
he
had
finished
his
consideration
of
those
reports
he
threw
overboard
all
the
plans
other
people
had
made
and
announced
his
own
every
man
who
works
for
me
is
going
to
get
enough
for
a
comfortable
living
he
said
if
an
man
ca
earn
that
he
either
lazy
or
ignorant
if
he
lazy
he
sick
we
have
a
hospital
if
he
ignorant
he
wants
to
learn
we
have
a
school
meantime
figure
out
in
the
accounting
bureau
a
scale
of
that
will
make
every
man
earnings
at
least
five
dollars
a
day
the
man
that
gets
the
smallest
wages
gets
the
biggest
share
of
the
profits
he
needs
it
most
on
january
ford
more
than
satisfied
the
expectant
manufacturers
of
the
world
he
launched
into
the
industrial
world
a
most
startling
bombshell
five
dollars
a
day
for
every
workman
in
the
ford
factory
he
crazy
other
manufacturers
said
aghast
why
those
dirty
ignorant
foreigners
do
earn
half
that
you
ca
run
a
business
that
way
that
man
ford
will
upset
the
whole
industrial
situation
what
is
he
trying
to
do
anyhow
they
demanded
when
every
detroit
factory
workman
grew
restless
the
news
spread
rapidly
everywhere
workers
dropped
their
tools
and
hurried
to
the
ford
factory
five
dollars
a
day
when
ford
reached
the
factory
in
the
morning
of
the
second
day
after
his
announcement
he
found
woodward
avenue
crowded
with
men
waiting
to
get
a
job
in
the
shops
an
hour
later
the
crowds
had
jammed
into
a
mob
which
massed
outside
the
buildings
and
spread
far
into
adjoining
streets
pushing
struggling
fighting
to
get
closer
to
the
doors
it
was
not
safe
to
open
them
that
mass
of
humanity
pushed
from
behind
would
have
wrecked
the
offices
the
manager
of
the
employment
department
opened
a
window
and
shouted
to
the
frantic
crowd
that
there
were
no
jobs
but
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
lost
in
the
roar
that
greeted
him
he
shut
the
window
and
telephoned
the
police
department
for
reserves
still
the
crowds
increased
every
moment
by
new
groups
of
men
wildly
eager
to
get
a
job
which
would
pay
them
a
comfortable
living
ford
looked
down
at
them
from
his
window
ca
you
make
them
understand
we
have
any
jobs
he
asked
the
employment
manager
the
man
disheveled
breathing
hard
and
hoarse
with
his
efforts
to
make
his
voice
heard
shook
his
head
the
police
are
coming
he
said
then
there
be
somebody
hurt
ford
predicted
we
ca
have
that
get
the
fire
hose
and
turn
it
on
the
crowd
that
will
do
the
business
a
moment
later
a
solid
stream
of
water
shot
from
the
doors
of
the
ford
factory
it
swept
the
struggling
men
half
off
their
feet
knocked
the
breath
from
their
bodies
left
them
gasping
startled
dripping
they
scattered
in
a
few
moments
the
white
stream
from
the
hose
was
sweeping
back
and
forth
over
a
widening
space
bare
of
men
when
the
police
arrived
the
crowd
was
so
dispersed
that
the
men
in
uniform
marched
easily
through
it
without
using
their
clubs
for
a
week
a
special
force
of
policemen
guarded
the
ford
factory
turning
back
heartsick
men
disappointed
in
their
hope
of
a
comfortable
living
wage
it
was
a
graphic
illustration
of
the
harm
done
the
whole
machine
by
the
loss
of
energy
stored
in
money
held
idle
in
the
hands
of
a
few
men
chapter
xxvi
making
it
pay
when
i
saw
thousands
of
men
in
detroit
alone
fighting
like
wild
animals
for
a
chance
at
a
decent
living
wage
it
brought
home
to
me
the
tremendous
economic
waste
in
our
system
of
doing
business
ford
said
every
man
in
those
crowds
must
go
back
to
a
job
if
he
found
one
at
all
that
did
not
give
him
a
chance
to
do
his
best
work
because
it
did
not
pay
him
enough
to
keep
him
healthy
and
happy
i
made
up
my
mind
to
put
my
project
through
to
prove
to
the
men
who
are
running
big
industries
that
my
plan
pays
i
wanted
employers
to
see
that
when
every
man
has
all
the
money
he
needs
for
comfort
and
happiness
it
will
be
better
for
everybody
i
wanted
to
prove
that
the
policy
of
trying
to
get
everything
good
for
yourself
really
hurts
you
in
the
end
he
paused
and
smiled
his
slow
whimsical
smile
well
i
guess
i
proved
it
he
said
six
weeks
after
the
plan
went
into
effect
in
his
factory
a
comparison
was
made
between
the
production
for
january
and
january
in
with
men
working
on
the
actual
production
of
cars
for
ten
hours
a
day
cars
were
made
and
shipped
under
the
new
plan
men
working
eight
hours
a
day
made
and
shipped
cars
again
ford
had
shown
the
value
of
that
intangible
impractical
thing
a
spirit
of
friendliness
and
good
will
on
the
ebb
tide
of
the
enthusiasm
which
had
stirred
this
country
at
the
announcement
of
his
plan
a
thousand
skeptical
opinions
arose
oh
he
doing
it
just
for
the
advertising
he
knew
right
enough
that
he
would
make
more
money
in
the
end
by
this
scheme
he
no
philanthropist
ford
wanted
his
new
plan
known
he
wanted
employers
everywhere
to
see
what
he
was
doing
how
he
did
it
and
what
the
effects
would
be
he
did
expect
the
factory
to
run
better
to
produce
more
cars
if
it
had
not
done
so
his
plan
would
have
been
a
failure
do
the
thing
that
is
best
for
everybody
and
it
will
be
best
for
you
in
the
end
that
was
his
creed
he
hoped
to
prove
its
truth
so
that
no
one
would
doubt
it
nor
is
ford
a
philanthropist
with
the
ordinary
implications
that
follow
that
word
he
is
a
practical
man
who
has
made
a
success
in
invention
in
organization
in
the
building
of
a
great
business
his
contribution
to
the
world
is
a
practical
contribution
his
message
is
a
practical
message
this
whole
world
is
like
a
machine
every
part
is
as
important
as
every
other
part
we
should
all
work
together
not
against
each
other
anything
that
is
good
for
all
the
parts
of
the
machine
is
good
for
each
one
of
them
or
look
at
it
as
a
human
body
the
welfare
of
one
part
is
dependent
on
all
the
other
parts
once
in
a
while
a
little
group
of
cells
get
together
and
takes
to
growing
on
its
own
account
not
paying
any
attention
to
the
rest
that
is
a
cancer
in
the
end
what
it
takes
from
the
rest
of
the
body
causes
the
death
of
the
whole
organism
what
do
those
independent
selfish
cells
get
out
of
it
i
tell
you
selfishness
trying
to
get
ahead
of
the
other
fellow
trying
to
take
away
from
other
people
is
the
worst
policy
a
man
can
follow
it
is
not
a
viewpoint
on
life
any
man
who
is
a
success
is
a
success
because
his
work
has
helped
other
men
whether
he
realizes
it
or
not
the
more
he
helps
other
men
the
more
successful
every
one
will
be
and
he
will
get
his
share
putting
his
plan
into
effect
was
not
a
simple
matter
of
writing
the
checks
he
had
to
educate
not
only
other
employers
but
his
own
men
as
well
they
must
be
taught
the
proper
way
to
use
money
so
that
it
would
not
be
a
detriment
to
themselves
or
a
menace
to
society
in
general
on
the
other
hand
ford
did
not
believe
in
the
factory
systems
in
use
abroad
he
did
not
mean
to
give
each
of
his
workmen
a
model
cottage
with
a
model
flower
garden
in
front
and
a
model
laundry
in
the
rear
and
say
to
them
look
at
the
flowers
but
do
not
pick
them
it
will
spoil
my
landscape
effect
look
at
the
lawn
but
do
not
cut
it
i
have
workmen
for
that
he
meant
to
place
no
restraints
on
the
personal
liberty
of
the
men
he
believed
that
every
man
if
given
the
opportunity
would
make
himself
a
good
substantial
citizen
industrious
thrifty
and
helpful
to
others
he
meant
his
plan
to
prove
that
theory
also
it
has
been
rumored
that
the
extra
share
of
profits
was
given
with
a
string
to
it
that
is
not
so
there
was
no
single
thing
a
man
must
have
to
do
to
entitle
him
to
his
share
he
need
not
own
a
home
start
a
bank
account
support
a
family
or
even
measure
up
to
a
standard
of
work
in
the
shops
manhood
and
thrift
were
the
only
requisites
and
the
company
stood
ready
to
help
any
man
attain
those
the
first
obstacle
was
the
fact
that
per
cent
of
the
men
did
not
speak
english
investigators
visiting
their
miserable
homes
were
obliged
to
speak
through
interpreters
a
school
was
started
where
they
might
learn
english
and
the
response
was
touching
more
than
a
thousand
men
enrolled
immediately
and
when
the
plan
was
discussed
in
the
shops
american
workmen
volunteered
to
help
in
teaching
so
thoroughly
had
the
ford
spirit
of
helpfulness
pervaded
the
factory
the
paid
teachers
were
dismissed
and
now
those
men
on
their
own
time
are
helping
their
to
learn
the
language
of
their
new
country
shortly
after
the
newspapers
had
carried
far
and
wide
the
news
of
revolutionary
theories
a
man
knocked
late
one
night
at
the
door
of
the
manager
home
will
you
give
me
a
job
he
asked
why
i
do
know
who
you
are
the
manager
replied
i
the
worst
man
in
detroit
said
the
caller
defiantly
years
old
and
i
done
years
in
jackson
prison
i
a
bad
actor
and
everybody
knows
it
i
ca
get
a
job
the
only
person
that
ever
played
me
true
is
my
wife
and
i
ai
going
to
have
her
taking
in
washing
to
support
me
if
you
want
to
give
me
a
job
all
right
if
you
do
i
going
back
to
jackson
prison
for
good
one
man
yet
i
want
to
get
and
i
get
him
somewhat
nonplussed
by
the
situation
the
manager
invited
the
man
in
talked
to
him
a
bit
and
called
up
ford
sure
give
him
a
chance
ford
voice
came
over
the
wire
he
a
man
is
he
he
entitled
to
as
good
a
chance
as
any
other
man
the
was
given
a
job
in
the
shops
for
a
couple
of
months
his
work
was
poor
the
foreman
reported
it
to
the
manager
the
manager
wrote
a
letter
telling
the
man
to
brace
up
there
was
plenty
of
good
stuff
in
him
if
he
would
take
an
interest
in
the
work
and
do
his
best
the
next
morning
he
came
into
the
manager
office
with
his
wife
so
broken
up
he
could
hardly
hold
his
voice
steady
that
letter
the
finest
thing
outside
of
what
my
wife
has
done
that
i
ever
had
happen
to
me
he
said
i
want
to
stick
here
i
do
the
best
i
know
how
i
work
my
hands
off
show
me
how
to
do
my
work
better
a
couple
of
months
later
he
came
into
the
office
and
took
a
small
roll
of
bills
out
of
his
pocket
say
he
said
shifting
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
running
his
fingers
around
the
brim
of
the
hat
in
his
hands
i
wonder
if
you
tell
me
how
to
get
into
a
bank
and
leave
this
and
what
bank
i
wise
how
to
get
in
and
take
it
out
but
i
ai
up
to
putting
it
in
without
some
advice
that
man
is
living
in
his
own
home
which
he
is
paying
for
on
the
installment
plan
and
he
is
one
of
the
best
workers
in
detroit
a
good
steady
man
his
chance
appearance
resulted
in
ford
policy
of
employing
convicts
wherever
his
investigators
come
across
them
nearly
a
hundred
many
of
them
on
parole
are
working
in
his
shops
and
he
considers
them
among
his
best
men
no
policy
is
any
good
if
it
can
not
go
into
a
community
and
take
every
one
in
it
young
old
good
bad
sick
well
and
make
them
all
happier
more
useful
and
more
prosperous
he
says
every
human
being
that
lives
is
part
of
the
big
machine
and
you
ca
draw
any
lines
between
parts
of
a
machine
they
all
important
you
ca
make
a
good
machine
by
making
only
one
part
of
it
good
this
belief
led
to
his
establishing
a
unique
labor
in
his
administration
building
a
department
that
makes
it
next
to
impossible
for
any
man
employed
in
the
organization
to
lose
his
job
chapter
xxvii
the
importance
of
a
job
that
surging
mob
of
men
outside
this
factory
during
the
week
following
the
announcement
of
his
plan
had
impressed
indelibly
on
ford
mind
the
tremendous
importance
of
a
job
a
workingman
job
is
his
life
he
says
no
one
man
should
have
the
right
ever
to
send
another
man
home
to
his
family
out
of
work
think
what
it
means
to
that
man
sitting
there
at
the
supper
table
looking
at
his
wife
and
children
and
not
knowing
whether
or
not
he
will
be
able
to
keep
them
fed
and
clothed
a
normal
healthy
man
wants
to
work
he
has
to
work
to
live
right
nobody
should
be
able
to
take
his
work
away
from
him
in
my
factory
every
man
shall
keep
his
job
as
long
as
he
wants
it
impractical
the
idea
seems
fantastic
in
its
impracticality
what
keep
every
man
lazy
stupid
impudent
dishonest
as
he
may
be
every
man
in
a
force
of
workmen
on
the
payroll
as
long
as
he
wants
to
stay
surely
if
there
is
any
point
at
which
ideals
of
human
brotherhood
end
and
coldblooded
business
methods
begin
this
should
be
that
point
but
ford
obstinate
in
his
determination
to
care
for
the
interests
of
every
one
declared
that
this
policy
should
stand
as
a
part
of
his
new
plan
he
installed
the
labor
clearing
house
as
part
of
his
employment
department
now
when
a
foreman
discharges
a
man
that
man
is
not
sent
out
of
the
factory
he
goes
with
a
written
slip
from
the
foreman
to
the
labor
clearing
house
there
he
is
questioned
what
is
wrong
is
he
ill
does
he
dislike
his
work
what
are
his
real
interests
in
the
end
he
is
transferred
to
another
department
which
seems
more
suited
to
his
taste
and
abilities
if
he
proves
unsatisfactory
there
he
returns
again
to
the
clearing
house
again
his
case
is
discussed
again
he
is
given
another
chance
in
still
another
department
meantime
the
employment
managers
take
an
active
interest
in
him
in
his
health
his
home
conditions
his
friends
he
is
made
to
feel
that
he
has
friends
in
the
management
who
are
eager
to
help
him
make
the
right
start
to
the
right
kind
of
life
perhaps
he
is
then
he
is
sent
to
the
company
hospital
given
medical
care
and
a
leave
of
absence
until
he
is
well
enough
to
resume
work
over
cases
of
tuberculosis
in
various
stages
were
discovered
among
ford
employees
when
his
hospital
was
established
these
men
presented
a
peculiar
problem
most
of
them
were
still
able
to
work
all
of
them
must
continue
working
to
support
families
yet
if
their
cases
were
neglected
it
meant
not
only
their
own
deaths
but
spreading
infection
in
the
factory
the
business
world
has
never
attempted
to
solve
the
problem
of
these
men
waste
from
the
great
machine
they
are
thrown
carelessly
out
unable
because
of
that
cough
to
get
another
job
left
to
shift
for
themselves
in
a
world
which
thinks
it
does
not
need
them
ford
established
a
department
especially
for
them
when
the
surgeons
discover
a
case
of
incipient
tuberculosis
in
the
ford
factory
they
transfer
the
man
to
this
department
where
the
air
filtered
dried
and
heated
is
scientifically
better
for
their
disease
than
the
mountain
climate
of
denver
here
the
men
are
given
light
jobs
which
they
can
handle
and
paid
their
regular
salaries
until
they
are
cured
and
able
to
return
to
their
former
places
in
the
shops
it
better
for
everybody
when
a
man
stays
at
work
instead
of
laying
off
ford
says
i
do
care
what
wrong
with
him
whether
he
a
misfit
in
his
department
or
stupid
or
sick
there
always
some
way
to
keep
him
doing
useful
work
and
as
long
as
he
is
doing
that
it
better
for
the
man
and
for
the
company
and
for
the
world
and
yet
there
are
men
in
business
who
install
systems
to
prevent
the
waste
of
a
piece
of
paper
or
a
stamp
and
let
the
human
labor
in
their
plants
go
to
waste
wholesale
yes
and
they
sat
up
and
said
i
was
a
sentimental
idiot
when
i
put
in
my
system
of
taking
care
of
the
men
in
my
place
they
said
it
would
not
pay
well
let
them
look
over
the
books
of
the
ford
factory
and
see
how
it
paid
how
it
paid
all
of
us
five
months
after
ford
new
plans
had
gone
into
effect
his
welfare
workers
made
a
second
survey
eleven
hundred
men
had
moved
to
better
homes
bank
deposits
had
increased
per
cent
twice
as
many
men
owned
their
own
homes
more
than
two
million
dollars
worth
of
detroit
real
estate
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
ford
employees
who
were
paying
for
it
on
the
installment
plan
among
the
workmen
only
still
lived
in
conditions
which
could
be
called
bad
in
the
reports
and
the
output
of
ford
automobiles
had
increased
over
per
cent
that
year
with
an
day
in
force
and
divided
in
extra
profits
among
the
men
the
factory
produced
over
more
cars
than
it
had
produced
during
the
preceding
year
under
the
old
conditions
cold
figures
had
proved
to
the
business
world
the
practical
value
of
sentimental
theories
ford
policy
had
not
only
done
away
with
the
labor
problem
it
had
also
shown
the
way
to
solve
the
problems
the
heart
of
the
struggle
between
capital
and
labor
is
the
idea
of
employer
and
employee
he
says
there
ought
not
to
be
employers
and
workmen
just
workmen
they
two
parts
of
the
same
machine
absurd
to
have
a
machine
in
which
one
part
tries
to
foil
another
my
job
at
the
plant
is
to
design
the
cars
and
keep
the
departments
working
in
harmony
i
a
workman
i
not
trying
to
slip
anything
over
on
the
other
factors
in
the
machine
how
would
that
help
the
plant
there
trouble
between
labor
and
capital
well
the
solution
is
not
through
one
side
getting
the
other
by
the
neck
and
squeezing
no
sir
that
is
a
solution
that
is
ruin
for
both
it
means
that
later
the
other
side
is
going
to
recover
and
try
to
get
on
top
again
and
be
constant
fighting
and
jarring
where
there
ought
to
be
harmony
and
adjustment
the
only
solution
is
to
get
together
it
ca
come
only
by
the
demands
of
labor
it
ca
come
only
by
the
advantages
of
capital
it
got
to
come
by
both
recognizing
their
interest
and
getting
together
that
the
solution
of
all
the
problems
in
the
world
as
i
see
it
let
people
realize
that
they
all
bound
together
all
parts
of
one
machine
and
that
nothing
that
hurts
one
group
of
people
will
fail
in
the
end
to
come
back
and
hurt
all
the
people
so
at
the
end
of
years
of
work
henry
ford
sat
in
his
office
on
his
birthday
and
looked
out
on
a
community
of
nearly
persons
working
efficiently
and
happily
together
working
for
him
and
for
themselves
well
paid
contented
he
thought
of
the
world
covered
with
the
network
of
his
agencies
crossed
and
recrossed
with
the
tracks
of
his
cars
he
had
run
counter
to
every
prompting
of
practical
business
judgment
all
his
life
he
had
left
the
farm
built
his
engine
left
the
moneyed
men
who
would
not
let
him
build
a
cheap
car
started
his
own
plant
on
insufficient
capital
built
up
his
business
established
his
scheme
all
against
every
dictate
of
established
practice
he
had
acted
from
the
first
on
that
one
fundamental
principle
do
the
thing
that
means
the
most
good
to
the
most
people
his
car
his
factory
his
workmen
his
sixty
millions
of
dollars
answered
conclusively
the
objection
i
know
it
the
right
thing
theoretically
but
it
is
practical
thinking
of
these
things
on
that
bright
summer
day
in
ford
decided
that
there
remained
only
one
more
thing
he
could
do
chapter
xxviii
a
great
educational
institution
it
happened
that
on
ford
birthday
a
commission
from
the
french
chamber
of
commerce
arrived
in
detroit
having
crossed
the
atlantic
to
inspect
the
ford
factories
they
viewed
acres
of
manufacturing
activity
the
largest
power
plant
in
the
world
developing
from
engines
designed
by
ford
engineers
the
enormous
cranes
machines
in
operation
in
one
great
room
using
fifty
miles
of
leather
belting
nine
cars
each
with
hoists
which
carry
materials
in
short
the
innumerable
details
of
that
mammoth
plant
then
they
inspected
the
hospitals
the
rest
rooms
noted
the
daylight
construction
of
the
whole
plant
the
ventilating
system
which
changes
the
air
completely
every
ten
minutes
the
devices
the
equipment
at
last
they
returned
to
henry
ford
office
with
notebooks
full
of
figures
and
information
to
be
taken
to
the
manufacturers
of
france
they
thanked
ford
for
his
courtesy
and
assured
him
that
they
comprehended
every
detail
of
his
policies
save
one
we
find
sir
said
the
spokesman
courteously
that
last
year
you
had
more
orders
than
you
could
fill
is
it
not
so
yes
that
is
correct
replied
ford
but
with
the
increased
output
this
year
we
hope
to
catch
up
and
yet
is
it
not
so
that
this
spring
you
lowered
the
price
of
your
car
fifty
dollars
yes
that
is
true
said
ford
but
sir
we
can
not
understand
is
it
then
true
that
you
reduce
your
prices
when
already
you
have
more
orders
than
you
can
fill
this
seems
strange
to
us
indeed
why
should
a
manufacturer
do
that
well
ford
answered
i
and
my
family
already
have
all
the
money
we
can
possibly
use
we
do
need
any
more
and
i
think
an
automobile
is
a
good
thing
i
think
every
man
should
be
able
to
own
one
i
want
to
keep
lowering
the
price
until
my
car
is
within
the
reach
of
every
one
in
america
you
see
that
is
all
i
know
how
to
do
for
my
country
unconsciously
he
was
voicing
the
new
patriotism
the
ideal
to
which
he
was
to
give
the
rest
of
his
life
he
said
it
simply
a
little
awkwardly
but
the
french
commission
awed
by
the
greatness
of
this
detroit
manufacturer
returned
and
reported
his
statement
to
the
french
people
as
the
biggest
thing
they
had
found
in
america
yet
this
viewpoint
was
the
natural
outcome
of
his
life
a
simple
man
seeing
things
simply
he
had
arrived
at
a
place
of
tremendous
power
in
america
he
had
come
to
a
time
when
he
need
no
longer
work
at
his
engine
or
his
factory
organization
he
had
leisure
to
survey
his
country
and
its
problems
to
apply
to
them
his
machine
idea
and
he
saw
in
america
a
great
machine
made
up
of
countless
human
parts
a
machine
which
should
work
evenly
efficiently
harmoniously
for
the
production
and
just
distribution
of
food
shelter
clothes
all
the
necessities
of
a
simple
and
comfortable
life
his
part
as
he
saw
it
was
to
make
and
distribute
automobiles
he
meant
to
do
his
part
in
the
best
way
he
knew
how
hoping
by
his
success
to
hasten
the
time
when
every
one
would
follow
his
example
and
all
the
terrible
friction
and
waste
of
our
present
system
would
be
stopped
this
was
his
only
interest
in
life
a
mechanic
who
had
left
school
at
sixteen
who
had
lived
all
his
life
among
machines
interested
in
practical
things
he
saw
no
value
in
anything
which
did
not
promote
the
material
of
the
people
art
music
painting
literature
architecture
luxuries
of
living
these
things
seemed
useless
to
him
education
come
to
detroit
and
i
show
you
the
biggest
school
in
the
world
he
says
every
man
there
is
learning
and
going
ahead
all
the
time
they
realizing
that
their
interests
are
the
same
as
their
employer
that
he
is
the
men
trustee
that
he
is
only
one
of
the
workmen
with
a
job
of
his
own
and
that
his
job
like
the
jobs
of
the
others
has
to
be
run
for
the
good
of
the
whole
plant
he
would
fire
a
man
who
took
away
from
the
other
men
for
his
own
advantage
that
spirit
would
harm
the
works
similarly
the
men
would
have
a
right
to
fire
him
if
he
took
away
from
them
for
his
personal
benefit
the
men
in
my
plant
are
learning
these
things
they
leading
the
way
for
the
workers
of
this
country
they
are
going
to
show
other
workers
just
as
i
hope
to
show
other
employers
that
things
should
be
run
for
the
most
good
for
the
most
people
that
the
education
we
need
this
education
outside
of
industry
that
we
have
is
just
the
perpetuation
of
tradition
and
convention
it
a
good
deal
of
a
joke
and
a
good
deal
of
waste
motion
to
my
mind
the
usefulness
of
a
school
ends
when
it
has
taught
a
man
to
read
and
write
and
figure
and
has
brought
out
his
capacity
for
being
interested
in
his
line
after
that
let
the
man
or
boy
get
after
what
he
is
interested
in
and
get
after
it
with
all
his
might
and
keep
going
ahead
that
is
school
if
those
young
fellows
who
are
learning
chemistry
in
colleges
were
enough
interested
in
chemistry
they
would
learn
it
the
way
i
did
in
my
little
back
shed
of
nights
i
would
not
give
a
plugged
nickel
for
all
the
higher
education
and
all
the
art
in
the
world
this
then
was
henry
ford
at
a
slender
slightly
stooped
man
with
hollow
cheeks
thin
firm
humorous
lips
gray
hair
a
man
with
sixty
odd
millions
of
dollars
used
to
hard
work
all
his
life
and
liking
it
a
man
who
on
a
single
idea
had
built
up
a
tremendous
organization
so
systematized
that
it
ran
by
itself
requiring
little
supervision
in
some
way
he
must
use
his
driving
energy
in
some
way
he
must
spend
his
millions
and
his
nature
demanded
that
he
do
it
along
the
line
of
that
idea
which
had
dominated
his
whole
life
the
machine
idea
of
humanity
the
idea
of
the
greatest
good
to
the
greatest
number
that
summer
for
the
first
time
he
found
himself
with
leisure
he
was
not
imperatively
needed
at
the
plant
he
and
ford
spent
some
time
in
greenfield
where
he
enlarged
the
old
farm
by
purchasing
nearly
four
thousand
acres
of
land
adjoining
it
he
himself
spent
some
time
on
the
problems
of
organizing
the
work
on
those
acres
he
and
his
wife
lived
in
the
house
where
they
had
begun
their
married
life
and
where
with
their
old
furniture
and
their
old
friends
they
reconstructed
the
life
of
thirty
years
before
ford
returned
to
detroit
with
a
working
model
for
a
cheap
which
he
intends
to
put
on
the
market
soon
he
worked
out
the
designs
and
dropped
them
into
the
roaring
cogs
of
his
organization
which
presently
produced
some
dozens
of
the
tractors
these
were
sent
down
to
the
farm
and
put
to
work
in
due
course
caught
up
again
by
the
ford
organization
the
tractors
will
begin
to
pour
out
in
an
endless
stream
and
ford
will
have
done
for
farm
work
what
he
did
for
passenger
traffic
but
he
realized
that
those
occupations
did
not
absorb
his
whole
energy
unconsciously
he
was
seeking
something
bigger
even
than
his
factories
than
his
business
operations
to
which
he
could
devote
his
mind
something
to
which
he
could
apply
his
ruling
idea
something
for
which
he
could
fight
the
terrible
of
august
which
brought
misery
ruin
desolation
to
europe
and
panic
to
the
whole
world
gave
him
his
opportunity
chapter
xxix
the
european
war
war
the
news
caught
at
the
heart
of
the
world
and
stopped
it
for
a
time
the
whole
business
structure
of
every
nation
on
earth
trembled
threatened
to
crumble
into
ruin
under
this
weight
to
which
it
had
been
building
from
the
beginning
greed
grasping
selfishness
a
policy
of
each
man
for
himself
against
other
men
these
are
the
foundations
on
which
nations
have
built
up
their
commercial
social
industrial
success
these
are
the
things
which
always
have
led
and
always
will
lead
to
war
to
the
destruction
of
those
structures
they
have
built
austria

france
belgium

england
japan
turkey
italy
one
by
one
they
crashed
down
into
the
general
wreck
everything
good
that
the
centuries
had
made
was
buried
in
the
debris
the
world
rocked
under
the
shock
here
in
america
we
read
the
reports
in
dazed
incredulity
it
could
not
be
possible
it
could
not
be
possible
we
said
to
each
other
with
white
lips
in
this
age
now
for
living
as
most
of
us
do
on
the
surface
of
things
among
our
friends
in
an
atmosphere
of
kindliness
and
helpfulness
we
had
been
cheerfully
unconcerned
about
the
foundations
of
our
economic
and
industrial
life
in
the
winter
there
are
thousands
of
unemployed
men
we
try
to
give
each
one
a
bowl
of
soup
a
place
to
sleep
our
street
corners
are
unpleasantly
infested
with
beggars
we
pass
an
ordinance
arrest
them
for
vagrancy
feed
them
a
few
days
and
order
them
to
leave
town
the
city
is
full
of
criminals
what
are
the
police
doing
we
inquire
testily
we
build
another
prison
erect
another
gallows
we
are
like
an
architect
who
seeing
threatening
cracks
in
the
walls
of
the
building
would
hurriedly
fill
them
with
putty
and
add
another
story
henry
ford
read
the
news
from
europe
he
saw
there
a
purposeless
useless
and
waste
of
everything
valuable
he
saw
a
machine
wrongly
built
for
centuries
so
that
each
part
would
work
against
all
the
other
parts
suddenly
set
in
motion
and
wrecking
itself
it
was
a
repetition
on
a
larger
scale
of
a
catastrophe
with
which
he
had
been
familiar
in
the
business
world
how
many
companies
in
his
own
field
had
been
organized
in
the
early
days
of
the
industry
had
gone
into
business
with
the
one
purpose
of
getting
all
they
could
from
every
one
workers
stockholders
buyers
and
had
gone
down
in
ruin
only
those
companies
which
had
been
built
on
some
basis
of
fair
service
had
succeeded
and
these
had
done
so
in
proportion
to
their
real
value
to
others
whether
or
not
this
principle
is
recognized
by
those
who
profit
from
it
it
is
the
fundamental
principle
on
which
business
success
is
built
the
trouble
is
that
people
do
not
see
that
said
ford
a
man
goes
into
business
from
purely
selfish
motives
he
works
for
himself
and
against
every
one
else
as
far
as
he
can
but
only
so
far
as
his
grasping
selfishness
really
works
out
in
benefit
to
other
people
he
succeeds
if
he
knew
that
if
he
went
to
work
deliberately
to
help
other
people
he
would
do
more
good
and
at
the
same
time
he
would
make
a
bigger
success
for
himself
but
instead
of
that
he
gets
more
and
more
selfish
when
he
has
got
a
lot
of
money
and
becomes
a
real
power
he
uses
his
power
selfishly
he
thinks
it
is
his
grasping
policy
that
has
made
him
successful
why
everything
i
ever
did
selfishly
in
my
life
has
come
back
like
a
boomerang
and
hurt
me
more
than
it
hurt
any
one
else
and
the
same
way
with
everything
i
have
done
to
help
others
it
helps
me
in
the
end
every
time
it
is
bound
to
as
long
as
a
machine
runs
anything
that
is
really
good
for
one
part
is
good
for
the
whole
machine
look
at
those
fighting
nations
every
one
of
them
is
hurting
itself
as
much
as
it
hurts
the
enemy
their
success
was
founded
on
the
fact
that
they
have
helped
each
other
england
got
her
dyes
and
her
tools
and
her
toys
from
germany
germany
got
her
wheat
from
russia
and
her
fruits
and
olives
from
italy
turkey
got
her
ships
from
england
they
were
all
helping
each
other
their
real
interests
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
their
people
were
all
one
interest
left
to
themselves
the
real
german
people
would
never
fight
the
french
people
never
in
the
world
no
more
than
iowa
would
fight
michigan
race
differences
they
do
not
exist
in
sufficient
degree
to
make
men
fight
and
they
are
disappearing
every
day
see
how
the
races
mix
in
america
i
have
nationalities
speaking
more
than
one
hundred
different
languages
and
dialects
in
my
shops
and
they
never
have
any
trouble
they
realize
that
their
interests
are
all
the
same
what
is
the
root
of
the
whole
question
the
real
interests
of
all
men
are
the
same
work
food
and
shelter
and
happiness
when
they
all
work
together
for
those
every
one
will
have
plenty
what
do
people
fight
for
does
fighting
make
more
jobs
better
homes
more
to
eat
no
people
fight
because
they
are
taught
that
the
only
way
to
get
these
things
is
to
take
them
from
some
one
else
the
common
people
the
people
who
lose
most
by
fighting
do
know
what
they
are
fighting
for
they
fight
because
they
are
told
to
what
do
they
get
out
of
it
disgust
shame
grief
wounds
death
ruin
starvation
war
is
the
most
hideous
waste
in
the
world
in
the
first
terrible
months
of
the
war
the
american
people
in
horror
echoed
that
opinion
with
the
spectacle
of
half
the
world
in
bloody
ruins
before
our
eyes
we
recoiled
we
thanked
god
that
our
country
remained
sane
we
saw
a
vision
of
america
after
the
madness
had
passed
helping
to
bind
up
the
wounds
of
europe
helping
to
make
a
permanent
peace
which
should
bring
the
people
of
the
earth
together
in
one
fraternity
by
degrees
that
feeling
began
to
change
we
want
peace
are
there
a
hundred
men
among
our
hundred
million
who
will
say
they
want
war
for
war
sake
we
want
peace
but
we
have
begun
to
ask
that
old
question
is
it
practical
that
vision
of
the
people
of
the
world
working
together
increasing
their
own
happiness
and
comfort
by
helping
to
make
happiness
and
comfort
for
each
other
it
is
a
beautiful
theory
but
is
it
not
a
bit
sentimental
a
bit
visionary
just
a
little
too
good
to
be
true
here
is
a
world
where
war
happens
we
say
if
a
war
should
happen
to
us
what
would
we
do
let
us
begin
to
prepare
for
war
let
us
take
war
into
our
calculations
let
us
be
practical
and
henry
ford
reading
the
papers
listening
to
the
talk
of
the
men
in
the
streets
saw
the
object
lesson
of
his
great
organization
disregarded
he
heard
again
the
objection
which
had
met
every
step
of
his
life
it
is
a
good
idea
but
it
is
theoretical
it
is
not
practical
it
will
not
work
things
never
have
done
that
way
he
saw
this
country
already
wasting
incalculable
human
energy
destroying
innumerable
lives
daily
because
of
a
practical
system
of
organization
preparing
to
drain
off
still
more
energy
still
greater
wealth
in
preparation
for
a
still
more
terrible
waste
the
dearest
principle
of
his
life
the
principle
whose
truth
he
had
proven
through
a
life
of
hard
work
was
in
danger
of
being
swept
away
and
forgotten
chapter
xxx
the
best
preparedness
henry
ford
saw
that
the
meaning
of
his
work
was
about
to
be
lost
he
was
in
for
the
greatest
fight
of
his
life
he
counted
his
resources
the
mammoth
factory
was
still
running
to
capacity
the
farm
tractors
which
would
mean
so
much
in
increased
production
of
food
in
greater
comforts
for
millions
of
farmers
were
almost
ready
to
be
put
on
the
market
his
plan
for
with
the
buyers
of
his
cars
had
recently
been
announced
three
hundred
thousand
men
in
this
country
would
have
during
an
actual
proof
in
dollars
and
cents
of
the
practical
value
of
coöperation
of
principle
that
helping
the
other
fellow
will
help
you
those
men
would
share
with
him
the
profit
which
would
add
still
more
millions
to
his
credit
ford
had
these
things
he
had
also
a
tremendous
fortune
at
his
command
he
cast
about
for
ways
of
using
that
fortune
in
this
fight
and
again
the
uselessness
of
money
was
impressed
upon
him
money
is
of
no
real
value
whatever
he
says
what
can
i
do
with
it
now
i
can
not
pay
a
man
enough
to
make
him
change
his
real
opinions
the
only
real
resource
this
country
has
now
is
the
intelligence
of
our
people
they
must
think
right
they
must
know
the
true
principles
on
which
to
build
a
great
strong
nation
they
must
hold
firm
to
the
big
true
things
and
realize
some
way
they
must
be
made
to
realize
that
they
are
practical
that
ideals
are
the
only
practical
things
in
this
world
it
is
to
everybody
interest
to
do
right
not
in
the
next
world
nor
in
a
spiritual
way
only
but
in
good
hard
business
value
let
be
practical
suppose
we
do
prepare
for
war
suppose
we
do
take
the
energies
of
our
young
men
and
spend
them
in
training
for
war
our
country
needs
the
whole
energy
of
every
man
in
productive
work
work
that
will
make
more
food
more
clothing
better
houses
but
suppose
we
turn
that
energy
from
real
uses
train
it
to
destroy
instead
of
to
create
suppose
we
have
half
a
million
young
men
ready
to
fight
what
weapons
shall
we
give
them
shall
we
give
them
guns
they
will
be
out
of
date
shall
we
give
them
poisonous
gases
or
disease
germs
or
shall
we
invent
something
even
more
horrible
as
fast
as
we
make
these
things
other
nations
will
make
worse
ones
shall
we
turn
our
factories
into
munition
plants
shall
we
build
dreadnoughts
the
submarine
destroys
them
shall
we
build
submarines
other
nations
will
make
shall
we
build
other
nations
will
build
to
destroy
them
we
must
make
something
worse
than
the
aeroplanes
and
something
worse
still
and
then
something
still
more
horrible
bidding
senselessly
up
and
up
and
up
spending
millions
on
millions
trying
to
outdo
other
nations
which
are
trying
to
outdo
us
for
if
we
begin
to
prepare
for
war
we
must
not
stop
we
can
not
stop
i
read
articles
in
the
magazines
saying
that
we
might
as
well
have
no
navy
at
all
as
the
one
we
have
that
we
might
as
well
have
no
army
as
the
army
we
have
if
this
country
should
be
invaded
yet
we
have
already
spent
millions
on
that
army
and
that
navy
let
us
spend
millions
more
and
more
millions
and
more
and
still
unless
we
keep
on
spending
more
than
any
other
nation
can
spend
we
might
as
well
have
no
army
or
navy
at
all
and
yet
there
are
people
who
think
that
to
begin
such
a
course
is
is
good
common
sense
i
tell
you
the
only
real
strength
of
a
nation
is
the
spirit
of
its
people
the
only
real
practical
value
in
the
world
is
the
spirit
of
the
people
of
the
world
there
were
animals
on
the
earth
ages
ago
who
could
kill
a
hundred
men
with
one
sweep
of
a
paw
but
they
are
gone
and
we
survive
why
because
men
have
minds
because
they
use
their
minds
in
doing
useful
things
making
food
and
clothes
and
shelters
a
few
hundred
years
ago
no
man
was
safe
on
the
street
alone
at
night
no
woman
was
safe
unless
she
had
a
man
with
her
who
was
strong
enough
to
kill
other
men
we
have
changed
all
that
how
by
force
no
because
we
have
learned
in
a
small
degree
that
there
are
things
better
than
force
we
have
learned
that
to
look
out
for
the
interests
of
every
one
in
our
community
is
best
for
us
in
the
end
let
us
realize
that
to
think
of
the
welfare
of
the
whole
world
is
best
for
each
one
of
us
we
do
not
carry
a
gun
so
that
if
we
meet
an
englishman
on
the
street
and
he
attacks
us
we
can
kill
him
we
know
he
does
not
want
to
kill
us
we
know
that
the
real
people
of
the
whole
world
do
not
want
war
we
do
not
want
war
there
are
only
a
few
people
who
think
they
want
war
the
politicians
the
rulers
the
big
business
men
who
think
they
can
profit
by
it
war
injures
everybody
else
and
in
the
end
it
injures
them
too
the
way
to
handle
the
war
question
is
not
to
waste
more
and
more
human
energy
in
getting
ready
to
hurt
the
other
fellow
we
must
get
down
to
the
foundations
we
must
realize
that
the
interests
of
all
the
people
are
one
and
that
what
hurts
one
hurts
us
all
we
must
know
that
and
we
must
have
the
courage
to
act
on
it
a
nation
of
a
hundred
million
people
of
all
nationalities
and
races
we
must
work
together
each
of
us
doing
what
he
can
for
the
best
good
of
the
whole
then
we
can
show
europe
when
at
last
her
crippled
people
drag
themselves
back
to
their
ruined
homes
that
a
policy
of
peace
and
hopefulness
does
pay
that
it
is
practical
we
can
show
them
that
we
do
mean
to
help
them
they
will
believe
it
if
we
do
not
say
it
behind
a
gun
if
we
carry
a
gun
we
must
depend
on
the
gun
to
save
our
nation
we
must
frankly
say
that
we
believe
in
force
and
nothing
else
we
must
admit
that
human
brotherhood
and
ideals
of
mutual
good
will
and
helpfulness
are
secondary
to
power
and
willingness
to
commit
murder
that
only
a
murderer
at
heart
can
afford
to
have
them
we
must
abandon
every
principle
on
which
our
country
was
founded
every
inch
of
progress
we
have
made
since
men
were
frankly
beasts
but
if
our
country
is
not
to
go
down
as
all
nations
have
gone
before
her
depending
on
force
and
destroyed
by
force
we
must
build
on
a
firm
foundation
we
must
build
on
our
finest
biggest
instincts
we
must
go
fearlessly
ahead
not
looking
back
and
put
our
faith
in
the
things
which
endure
and
which
have
grown
stronger
through
every
century
of
history
democracy
every
man
right
to
comfort
and
plenty
and
happiness
human
brotherhood
mutual
helpfulness
these
are
the
real
practical
things
these
are
the
things
on
which
we
can
build
surely
and
firmly
these
are
the
things
which
will
last
these
are
the
things
which
will
pay
i
have
proved
them
over
and
over
again
in
my
own
life
other
men
so
far
as
they
have
trusted
them
have
proved
them
america
has
built
on
them
the
richest
most
successful
nation
in
the
world
just
so
far
as
we
continue
to
trust
them
to
build
on
them
we
will
continue
to
be
prosperous
and
successful
i
know
this
if
my
life
has
taught
me
anything
at
all
it
has
taught
me
that
i
will
spend
every
ounce
of
energy
i
have
every
hour
of
my
life
in
the
effort
to
prove
it
to
other
people
only
so
far
as
we
all
believe
it
only
so
far
as
we
all
use
our
strength
and
our
abilities
not
to
hurt
but
to
help
other
peoples
will
we
help
ourselves
this
is
the
end
of
my
story
and
the
beginning
of
henry
ford

the
